WEBVTT

01:10.195 --> 01:13.238
Mr Bond, I'm so glad I caught you.

01:13.364 --> 01:18.577
Your office called. They're sending
a helicopter. Some sort of emergency.

01:18.661 --> 01:21.121
It usually is. Thank you.

02:44.038 --> 02:46.665
Good afternoon, Mr Bond.

02:46.791 --> 02:51.420
Don't concern yourself with the pilot.
One of my less useful people.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.929
You are now flying
Remote Control Airways!

03:29.334 --> 03:32.628
Think twice, 007, it's a long way down.

04:08.831 --> 04:12.668
I've looked forward
to this moment, Mr Bond.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.963
I intend to enjoy it to the full.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.003
Really! Have you no respect for the dead?

04:58.756 --> 05:00.924
Goodbye, Mr Bond!

05:01.009 --> 05:04.011
I trust you had a pleasant fright?

05:22.822 --> 05:25.949
You're fading from my picture, Mr Bond,

05:26.034 --> 05:30.120
but the end cannot be far away.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.953
We can do a deal!

06:12.038 --> 06:14.373
I'll buy you a delicatessen!

06:14.457 --> 06:16.375
In stainless steel!

06:17.877 --> 06:19.211
Please!

06:19.295 --> 06:24.549
- All right, keep your hair on!
- Put me down! Put me down!

06:24.634 --> 06:26.968
You want to get off?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.039
Afternoon! How is it topside?

10:24.248 --> 10:26.958
Beautiful day,
just bringing the nets in.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.502
Fish for supper again!

10:39.722 --> 10:43.433
Decode of Russian satellite data, sir,
on British ship positions.

10:43.517 --> 10:46.478
- Verify and advise Admiralty.
- Yes, sir.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.774
- Afternoon, sir.
- Hello, Mac.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.569
My watch.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.241
Where the hell did that come from?

11:45.955 --> 11:48.998
- What's going on?
- Unidentified object closing fast.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.140
Secure Operations Room!

12:06.600 --> 12:08.977
Destruct ATAC system!

12:49.518 --> 12:51.978
- Yes?
- First Sea Lord and Vice Admiral, sir.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.314
Send them in.

12:58.778 --> 13:03.615
Minister, we've lost our electronic
surveillance ship, the St. Georges.

13:03.699 --> 13:06.743
We had a routine message
at 1600 hours yesterday.

13:06.827 --> 13:10.246
Then nothing. We sighted
floating debris this morning.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.332
My God, Jack!

13:12.792 --> 13:17.086
- How deep is the water there?
- Not deep enough, I'm afraid.

13:20.174 --> 13:22.675
Yes, Comrade Secretary, off Albania.

13:22.760 --> 13:27.222
The suspected British spy ship
which we have been monitoring.

13:27.640 --> 13:32.602
So there is a chance of
obtaining the ATAC transmitter.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.483
Of course, there will be
no direct involvement.

13:38.567 --> 13:44.781
But if it comes on the market we should
not lose such a remarkable opportunity.

13:46.909 --> 13:51.162
With that in mind, I've already
contacted our usual friend in Greece.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.799
- Down you go.
- Down you go.

14:52.141 --> 14:55.894
- Give us a kiss!
- I'll give you a nut. Here you are.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.359
Come on.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.155
- Your packages, señorita.
- Thank you.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.703
Melina!

15:30.304 --> 15:32.096
Thank you, darling.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.723
Hello, Daddy.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.477
Welcome home, Melina.
You look beautiful.

15:37.853 --> 15:40.772
Your call from Athens was a surprise.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.692
I was lucky to find you.
You left Crete so suddenly.

15:45.361 --> 15:49.280
I wanted to start work on the temple.
You between jobs?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.199
Only for a few days.

15:51.408 --> 15:55.036
- I'll lend a hand.
- Darling, it's beautiful. Thank you.

15:55.704 --> 15:58.414
That's for you. And pistachios for Max.

17:18.954 --> 17:23.124
- James!
- Moneypenny, a feast for my eyes!

17:23.709 --> 17:27.670
- What about the rest of you?
- I was getting round to that.

17:27.755 --> 17:32.759
You'd better go in. M's on leave.
The Minister's here with the Chief of Staff.

17:32.843 --> 17:34.886
He wants to see you at once.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.805
- I'll be right back.
- I can hardly wait!

17:38.057 --> 17:40.475
Haven't you forgotten something?

17:42.144 --> 17:43.936
As M's away.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.194
There you are, 007.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.238
Minister. Chief of Staff.

17:54.323 --> 17:58.117
- Are you aware of our ATAC system?
- ATAC, sir?

17:58.202 --> 18:00.411
Automatic Targeting
Attack Communicator.

18:00.496 --> 18:05.583
Uses an ultra-low frequency to order
our submarines to launch missiles.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.671
Five days ago, our spy ship St. Georges
was sunk in the Ionian Sea.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.508
She was equipped with ATAC.

18:13.592 --> 18:18.805
In the wrong hands, that transmitter
would render our Polaris fleet useless.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.933
Orders could be countermanded.

18:22.017 --> 18:26.354
Worse, our own submarines could be
ordered to attack our own cities.

18:28.023 --> 18:30.358
Have we begun a salvage operation?

18:30.442 --> 18:35.321
Out of the question. The St. Georges
was off the Albanian coast.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.742
We asked Sir Timothy Havelock
to locate the wreck.

18:39.827 --> 18:44.997
Before he could report, he and his wife
were killed by a Cuban, Hector Gonzales.

18:46.083 --> 18:49.418
The Greek police were able
to identify Gonzales from a description

18:49.503 --> 18:52.463
given by Melina, the Havelocks' daughter.

18:53.507 --> 18:57.135
Operation Undertow,
the information's all here.

18:57.219 --> 19:03.307
Gonzales is at a villa near Madrid.
Isolate him and find out who hired him.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.419
A Walther PPK.

21:37.212 --> 21:42.049
Standard issue, British Secret Service.
Licensed to kill

21:44.678 --> 21:47.680
or be killed. Take him away!

22:17.002 --> 22:18.419
Excuse me.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.133
Whoever you are,
you're not welcome. Come on.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.082
I hope you have a car.

23:38.667 --> 23:39.917
This way.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.187
Hurry!

24:12.868 --> 24:15.536
- Who are you?
- He killed my parents.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.538
The Havelocks?

24:18.415 --> 24:19.832
I'm sorry.

24:25.755 --> 24:29.383
- How did you find Gonzales?
- Through a detective agency.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.886
What were you doing there?

24:33.013 --> 24:35.723
I'm afraid we're being out-horsepowered.

24:50.614 --> 24:52.072
Excuse me!

25:05.045 --> 25:06.754
Take the low road!

25:08.590 --> 25:10.090
Not that low!

25:24.397 --> 25:26.815
You don't mind if I drive, do you?

26:43.560 --> 26:45.853
Go backwards forwards quickly!

27:49.250 --> 27:51.418
Love a drive in the country, don't you?

27:58.468 --> 27:59.927
Hold tight!

28:25.829 --> 28:28.372
By the way, we haven't
been introduced, Melina.

28:28.456 --> 28:31.208
My name is Bond. James Bond.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.300
Olympic has a flight at 11.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.473
Should be safe to go to the airport now.

28:51.813 --> 28:54.106
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.316
Really.

28:57.235 --> 29:01.405
- Going back to your father's ship?
- Yes, I'm continuing his work.

29:01.531 --> 29:04.742
- But this business is unfinished.
- What business?

29:04.826 --> 29:07.119
The man who paid Gonzales.

29:07.912 --> 29:09.955
The Chinese have a saying.

29:10.540 --> 29:15.794
Before setting out on revenge,
you first dig two graves.

29:15.879 --> 29:19.089
I don't expect you to understand.
You're English.

29:20.049 --> 29:21.800
But I'm half-Greek.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.344
And Greek women, like Elektra,

29:25.013 --> 29:27.347
always avenge their loved ones.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.184
I must go.

29:37.192 --> 29:41.945
You were to question Gonzales,
not let Miss Havelock perforate him!

29:42.030 --> 29:43.030
Yes, sir.

29:43.114 --> 29:47.075
We'll have to tell the PM
Operation Undertow is a failure.

29:47.368 --> 29:49.828
She'll have our guts for garters!

29:50.580 --> 29:54.416
If you look again
at page 2 paragraph 4 of my report,

29:54.501 --> 29:57.503
you'll note that I saw someone
paying off Gonzales.

29:57.587 --> 30:02.257
If that was for Havelock's murder,
there is still a glimmer of hope.

30:02.842 --> 30:06.386
- I don't follow.
- If we could identify that someone...

30:06.513 --> 30:08.972
Why don't you try the Identigraph?

30:11.059 --> 30:13.393
- Yes, sir.
- Get cracking, 007!

30:14.979 --> 30:16.313
Minister.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.944
Hello, Q.

30:22.362 --> 30:25.864
- Smithers, how's the arm?
- Coming along nicely, sir.

30:28.368 --> 30:30.244
That'll come in handy.

30:30.328 --> 30:33.288
- What are you doing here, 007?
- Identigraph, Q.

30:33.373 --> 30:34.706
This way.

30:45.677 --> 30:49.179
- Stinging in the rain?
- That's not funny, 007!

30:50.515 --> 30:52.850
You put the Lotus back together?

30:53.142 --> 30:56.770
I disregard these gibes
about our equipment, 007!

30:57.188 --> 31:00.899
- You don't find it funny in the field.
- Indeed, I don't.

31:07.198 --> 31:11.451
This 3-D visual Identigraph
is still in the experimental stage.

31:12.036 --> 31:18.333
Once we get a composite of the man,
we can match it through the files

31:18.418 --> 31:22.129
of the Sûreté, Interpol, CIA, the Mossad...

31:22.213 --> 31:27.134
And the West German Police.
You've told me so, Q. Five times.

31:28.261 --> 31:29.928
Thank you, 007.

31:31.431 --> 31:32.556
Right.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.226
Describe the person
you wish to identify.

31:36.311 --> 31:41.815
- I'll programme the information.
- Male Caucasian. Late 30s.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.820
Hair fine, light brown.

31:49.657 --> 31:51.700
That's it. Parted in the middle.

31:51.784 --> 31:53.327
Wait a minute.

31:54.287 --> 31:57.664
- Right.
- Eyes a little smaller.

31:58.791 --> 32:01.627
Blue. A little greyer.

32:02.837 --> 32:05.672
That's it, you have it. Now, nose.

32:07.842 --> 32:10.844
- A nose, not a banana, Q!
- Sorry.

32:11.930 --> 32:14.848
Stop! Lips fuller.

32:18.853 --> 32:21.772
No, no. Mouth wider. Good.

32:26.152 --> 32:27.486
Thank you.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.698
Thank you, Sharon.
You can go. I'll lock up.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.747
We're almost there, Q. Apart from glasses.

32:39.040 --> 32:42.626
Steel-rimmed. Octagonal.

32:42.710 --> 32:44.378
Octagonal.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.716
That's him. That's our man.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.928
Right. I'll try and get a match.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.322
Sir, the man we want
is Emile Leopold Locque.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.992
An enforcer in the Brussels underworld.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.577
He's a convicted murderer.

33:18.329 --> 33:22.916
He escaped from Namur prison
by strangling his psychiatrist.

33:23.001 --> 33:26.837
He has worked for drug syndicates
in Marseilles and Hong Kong.

33:26.921 --> 33:29.339
Now working for Greek smugglers.

33:29.424 --> 33:33.427
The Italian Secret Service
think that he is in Cortina.

33:33.761 --> 33:37.014
Ferrara, our man in Italy,
will contact you there.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.348
Yes, sir.

33:38.433 --> 33:41.101
And, 007, try not to muck it up again.

33:42.311 --> 33:46.440
I'll do my best, sir.
I'll leave you to lock up. Let me out.

35:25.289 --> 35:29.543
- The snow is better at Innsbruck.
- But not at St. Moritz.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.672
- Ferrara.
- Bond, James.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.466
Luigi.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.927
I presume London's briefed you?

35:39.178 --> 35:41.763
If Locque's in Cortina, we'll find him.

35:42.682 --> 35:46.393
I have a reliable Greek contact here.
An Anglophile.

35:46.477 --> 35:49.396
He helped us out
on a smuggling operation.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.731
Then what's he doing in Cortina?

35:52.233 --> 35:53.400
He...

35:57.572 --> 36:00.490
spends a few months a year here
at his chalet.

36:00.575 --> 36:04.411
He's in shipping, insurance,
oil exploration.

36:04.495 --> 36:08.290
Knows everything going on. Very reliable.

36:08.833 --> 36:12.335
The British gave him a medal
for resistance fighting in the war.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.547
- Yes, but can I meet him?
- I've set it up.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.592
He is waiting for us
at the Olympic ice rink.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.266
Extend your arms!

36:35.776 --> 36:37.444
Signor Kristatos?

36:40.239 --> 36:43.074
- Kristatos, Aris Kristatos.
- Bond, James Bond.

36:43.159 --> 36:47.370
- Would you join me in some gluhwein?
- A very good idea. Thank you.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.917
Well, gentlemen, how can I help you?

36:52.335 --> 36:54.461
We'd like some information.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.889
My protégée.
A sure winner in the next Olympics.

37:05.973 --> 37:10.602
She's completely absorbed in her skating,
but innocent in the ways of the world.

37:11.729 --> 37:15.774
The day she wins the gold medal
will be the greatest in my life.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.663
Here are some new admirers for you.
Mr Bond, Mr Ferrara. Bibi Dahl.

37:30.289 --> 37:34.251
And her coach, Jacoba Brink,
a world-class skater herself.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.752
I've seen Miss Brink skate.

37:35.836 --> 37:39.047
The world will soon see a lot
of your skating too, Miss Dahl.

37:39.131 --> 37:41.800
Only if she works harder. Much harder.

37:42.051 --> 37:47.264
- Uncle Ari, can't I stop now? I'm pooped!
- That's for Miss Brink to decide.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.141
Come, Bibi. Another half-hour.

37:50.685 --> 37:55.397
- Will you take me to the biathlon?
- You know I have to work this afternoon.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.237
Bibi wants to know if you
would escort her, Mr Bond?

38:02.488 --> 38:05.615
- I don't...
- I would feel better if you would.

38:08.786 --> 38:11.871
I'd be delighted.
I'm staying at the Miramonte.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.206
Great!

38:14.333 --> 38:16.501
Now, how can I help you?

38:17.461 --> 38:21.881
- Do you know this man?
- Yes. Locque. Columbo's right hand.

38:22.216 --> 38:27.178
Milos Columbo. Involved in
a smuggling operation last year.

38:27.763 --> 38:32.142
That's the least of his offences.
Drugs, white slavery, contract murder.

38:32.685 --> 38:37.939
In the Greek underworld, he is
known as "The Dove". A very sick joke.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.900
- Where is this "Dove"?
- Somewhere in Greece.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.945
Once we were like brothers.
Now he hates me.

38:44.030 --> 38:48.325
We fought together in the Greek
Resistance and against the Communists.

38:49.201 --> 38:51.870
After that, he took a different path.

38:54.790 --> 38:57.500
Well, thank you
for your time, Mr Kristatos.

38:57.585 --> 39:02.297
My pleasure. I leave for Corfu soon.
If I hear any more, I will call Ferrara.

39:14.101 --> 39:19.147
So, Luigi, does this Columbo have the
resources to mount a salvage operation?

39:19.231 --> 39:23.443
Definitely. He runs a fleet
of freighters in the Aegean.

39:24.028 --> 39:27.113
I'll ring my office in Milano.
They may have more on him.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.334
Luigi, I'll see you later.

39:39.418 --> 39:40.460
OK.

39:55.643 --> 39:57.644
Is this the one, signora?

39:57.728 --> 40:01.898
Thank you. I'll take it.
Deliver it to the Hotel Cristallo, please.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.826
Beg your pardon.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.996
Buon giorno. May I help you?

40:17.289 --> 40:19.457
Yes, give me a dozen lilies.

40:27.341 --> 40:29.008
I'll pick them up later.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.684
Come on, quickly!

40:54.326 --> 40:56.870
Send them to the funeral, will you?

41:01.500 --> 41:05.170
Slow down! What the devil
are you doing in Cortina?

41:05.254 --> 41:07.964
- Your telegram.
- What telegram?

41:08.757 --> 41:11.885
It said you found the man
and to meet you here today.

41:12.219 --> 41:15.346
I didn't send a telegram. Now, get in.

41:17.433 --> 41:19.392
The station, please.

41:19.727 --> 41:22.562
- Are we leaving?
- Not we, you. And now.

41:23.522 --> 41:25.523
You don't tell me what to do.

41:42.708 --> 41:45.418
Did you find the man
who hired Gonzales?

41:45.920 --> 41:47.629
I'm working on it.

41:48.047 --> 41:52.175
He's here, isn't he?
That's why you're here.

41:52.635 --> 41:54.511
Driver, stop! Go back!

41:55.721 --> 41:58.640
- I'm staying!
- To put an arrow in his back?

41:58.724 --> 42:01.809
Then we'll never find out
who or what is behind this.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.812
It was my parents they killed.
Let me out!

42:05.105 --> 42:06.606
Driver, stop!

42:09.944 --> 42:14.113
Melina, look at me. You were lucky once,
but they are onto you now.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.950
The telegram,
the motorcycles back there.

42:17.409 --> 42:19.244
Please let me handle this.

42:19.328 --> 42:21.454
You? How are you involved?

42:21.997 --> 42:25.625
All I can say is it's of vital interest
to both our countries.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.127
More important than my parents?

42:30.339 --> 42:34.801
Your father was part of it.
He was prepared to risk his life.

42:35.469 --> 42:39.138
Melina, please trust me.
Go back to the Triana and wait.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.767
I'll find out what I can here,
then I'll come to Corfu.

42:43.269 --> 42:47.647
OK. I'll go back and wait.
But not for long.

42:48.148 --> 42:49.941
It won't be, I swear.

43:38.657 --> 43:41.409
Don't they have showers at the ice rink?

43:42.411 --> 43:43.953
How did you get in?

43:44.038 --> 43:47.665
One of the porters is a fan.
He'll do anything for me.

43:48.125 --> 43:50.293
And I'll do anything for you.

43:52.421 --> 43:55.548
I'm exceedingly flattered, Bibi,
but you're in training.

43:56.175 --> 43:59.969
That's a laugh. Everybody knows
it builds up muscle tone.

44:00.596 --> 44:04.891
Start building up a little more muscle tone
by putting on your clothes.

44:07.936 --> 44:09.604
Don't you like me?

44:11.023 --> 44:16.819
I think you're wonderful, Bibi,
but I don't think Uncle Ari would approve.

44:16.904 --> 44:20.239
Him? He thinks I'm still a virgin.

44:21.825 --> 44:27.038
Yes, well, you get your clothes on
and I'll buy you an ice cream!

44:35.589 --> 44:36.881
Shall we?

44:43.097 --> 44:45.390
Don't you ever come up for air?

44:45.474 --> 44:48.851
That's why I'll get the gold medal.
Breath control.

44:48.936 --> 44:51.437
Well, you can't lose!

44:56.819 --> 44:59.320
The leading skiers are at the firing range.

44:59.405 --> 45:02.990
There is Wolf Ghul from Austria,
Kerel Behrta from Switzerland,

45:03.075 --> 45:05.368
Wolfgang Blatt from Holland...

45:21.301 --> 45:25.430
And now Eric Kriegler,
last year's East European champion.

45:25.514 --> 45:30.143
He's coming up fast on
the West German champion, Hans Wolf.

45:34.314 --> 45:37.483
- There's Eric Kriegler.
- The East German champion?

45:38.819 --> 45:42.155
- Isn't he beautiful?
- Bibi, you're fickle.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.366
Eric!

45:48.078 --> 45:50.538
Come on! Let's go watch him shoot.

46:18.901 --> 46:21.611
Eric, we'll have a drink at the finish!

46:24.907 --> 46:28.701
- Well, Bibi, I have to leave you.
- No, James, stay with me!

46:29.036 --> 46:30.953
I have an appointment.

46:31.789 --> 46:35.124
Will you come and say goodbye
at the practice rink later?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.502
We're going back to Greece soon.

46:37.586 --> 46:41.672
All right, but if I can't make it,
don't grow up any more.

46:43.216 --> 46:45.593
The opposite sex would never survive it.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.269
Won't take long, Luigi.
Don't play with any of the switches.

56:11.493 --> 56:14.870
James, what took you so long?

56:15.455 --> 56:17.456
I took the scenic route.

56:18.583 --> 56:21.543
Tell me more about your boyfriend,
Eric Kriegler.

56:21.628 --> 56:26.465
He doesn't smoke, he only eats health
foods and he won't even talk to girls.

56:27.634 --> 56:30.636
- James, you're jealous!
- Of course.

56:30.845 --> 56:34.473
What else can you tell me about
my rival for your affections?

56:34.891 --> 56:37.684
They say he's a defector
from East Germany.

56:37.769 --> 56:40.229
Bibi! It is time for your rubdown.

56:50.156 --> 56:52.157
I could eat you up alive!

56:55.870 --> 56:58.747
Farewell, Mr Bond, but not goodbye!

58:41.184 --> 58:44.353
I'll be finished around six. Meet me here.

58:45.647 --> 58:48.482
James! How did you know I was here?

58:48.608 --> 58:51.985
I phoned the Triana.
They said you were coming ashore.

58:52.070 --> 58:55.739
I have to shop for the crew.
Come with me and we can talk.

59:19.973 --> 59:21.306
Thank you.

59:27.647 --> 59:29.648
I think you may need that.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.510
My father loved the view from here.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.346
- I can see why.
- We came here often.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:07.185
- Is Corfu your home?
- My real home's always been the Triana.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:12.482
The Greek islands, North Africa,
wherever my father's work took us.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:17.362
Did he leave any notes?
They could help us.

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.032
No, I don't think so.

01:00:21.826 --> 01:00:23.493
To tell the truth,

01:00:24.537 --> 01:00:27.956
I haven't had the courage
to go into his study since...

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.209
Try not to think about it now.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:35.213
I'm meeting a man tonight at the casino
who may give us a lead.

01:01:06.579 --> 01:01:08.580
You're perspiring, Bunky.

01:01:10.541 --> 01:01:12.542
Good evening, Contessa.

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:21.218
Your Lordship?

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.472
Five hundred thousand.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.600
Only half? Where's your courage, Bunky?

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:32.229
Courage is no match
for an unfriendly shoe, Countess.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.359
Bravo, Bunky!

01:01:43.574 --> 01:01:45.117
A lucky night!

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.637
The odds favour standing pat.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:08.265
If you play the odds.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:18.567
Would you cash these in for me, please?

01:02:20.278 --> 01:02:21.486
Thank you.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.029
Excuse me.

01:02:41.799 --> 01:02:44.301
- Aperitif?
- Ouzo for me, please.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.350
And to eat?

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:55.562
I'll have the Préveza prawns, salad...

01:02:55.646 --> 01:02:59.357
- And bourdetto.
- I'll have the same.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:03.361
May I suggest a white Robola wine
from Cephalonia, my home place?

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:09.701
Forgive me, but it's too scented for me.
I prefer the Theotaki Aspro.

01:03:12.997 --> 01:03:18.919
After our last meeting, I wondered why
you asked about Locque, Columbo's man.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:24.633
I know Columbo runs heroin to be
refined here before it is sent to England.

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:30.388
So, I think I see the answer.
You are from the British Narcotics Board.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.850
- Am I right?
- Go on.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.231
I wish you luck, my friend.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:46.112
Stopping Columbo will be difficult. He has
connections. You cannot just arrest him.

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:49.074
You must find a different way.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.535
You may have to kill him.

01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:54.996
Does this discourage you?

01:03:57.583 --> 01:04:01.878
- Just tell me where he is.
- Over there. With the woman in blue.

01:04:05.591 --> 01:04:08.802
We ignore each other,
but I wanted you to see him.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:12.764
He is a secret partner in this casino.
But we are quite safe.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:15.767
He will do nothing in his own place.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.436
And the Countess?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.524
Lisl? An Austrian. Expensive mistress.

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:28.280
She sometimes shills for the house.
If she bets, it's with other people's money.

01:04:50.011 --> 01:04:55.891
Stopping Columbo will be difficult. He has
connections. You cannot just arrest him.

01:04:56.642 --> 01:04:58.643
You must find a different way.

01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:01.354
You may have to kill him.

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:05.108
Does this discourage you?

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:08.987
Just tell me where he is.

01:05:23.127 --> 01:05:26.546
You are a disgusting man.
How dare you talk to me like that!

01:05:26.631 --> 01:05:29.215
I will speak to you any way I please.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:32.385
Sit down! You're making
a spectacle of yourself.

01:05:34.972 --> 01:05:36.264
Get out!

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:39.017
Nothing would please me more.

01:05:47.193 --> 01:05:50.236
- This may be an opportunity.
- This may be a trap.

01:05:50.905 --> 01:05:54.532
- If you play the odds.
- As you wish. Take my car.

01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:58.870
I'll play a little chemmy.
Ask the chauffeur to come back for me.

01:06:09.173 --> 01:06:10.590
Allow me.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:15.929
- May I drive you home?
- No, thank you. I'll take a taxi.

01:06:16.263 --> 01:06:20.767
No courage? Seriously, you may
have a job finding one this time of night.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.396
Well, you look like a gentleman.

01:06:24.981 --> 01:06:26.189
Why not?

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.659
I'm the Countess Lisl von Schlaf.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:43.123
My name is Bond. I'm preparing
a novel about Greek smugglers.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:46.835
- Do you know any?
- How would I know any smugglers?

01:06:47.878 --> 01:06:53.258
I would have thought that a lady
in your position would know many things.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:55.760
I'd really be most grateful.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.138
- How grateful?
- Very.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.433
I adore grateful men.

01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:34.382
May I call you tomorrow, Countess?

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:39.596
I've champagne and oysters in the fridge.
Why not come in for a bite?

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:46.478
I won't need you any more tonight.

01:08:13.714 --> 01:08:15.799
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:25.058
Me nightie's slipping.

01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:28.560
So's your accent, Countess.

01:08:30.314 --> 01:08:32.148
- Manchester?
- Close.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.274
Liverpool.

01:08:35.236 --> 01:08:39.197
It was an amusing performance
between you and the owner of this.

01:08:40.241 --> 01:08:42.575
What did Columbo whisper to you?

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.162
That you were a spy.
To find out more about you.

01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:49.624
And have you?

01:08:51.042 --> 01:08:52.460
Have I ever!

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.406
When you're ready to leave,
you can take my car.

01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:25.410
That sounds like a dismissal.

01:09:25.703 --> 01:09:28.287
I was looking forward to breakfast.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:09.996
Lisl, come back!

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:44.948
Get in...

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.671
Goodbye, Countess.

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.847
What should I do with you?

01:11:50.931 --> 01:11:54.767
You cannot just arrest him.
You must find a different way.

01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:59.856
You may have to kill him.
Does this discourage you?

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:03.151
Just tell me where he is.

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:06.904
I am here, Mr Bond
of the British Secret Service.

01:12:08.198 --> 01:12:12.618
But I tell you
it is Kristatos you want, not me.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:18.291
He told you about himself.
He's the one with the connections.

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:21.586
Locque works for him, not for me.

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:27.425
I smuggle, yes. I smuggle gold,
diamonds, cigarettes, pistachio nuts.

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:29.761
But no heroin.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:31.637
Sit down.

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:36.768
That I leave to him, when he is
not too busy working for Russia.

01:12:36.852 --> 01:12:40.813
- Against my country and yours.
- My country awarded him a medal.

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:44.400
Yes, I know.
But other people died for it.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:48.029
All through the fighting in Crete,
he was a double agent.

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.908
King's Medal.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:58.456
I would laugh if my heart
was not so heavy about my poor Lisl.

01:13:00.626 --> 01:13:03.378
What does Kristatos gain
by setting you up?

01:13:03.462 --> 01:13:06.130
I know too much about him.

01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:09.258
He wants me out of the way.

01:13:09.968 --> 01:13:14.180
By using a British agent
to do his dirty work for him,

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:18.559
your government might
give him another medal.

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:22.397
- Why should I believe you?
- I'll prove it to you tonight.

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:26.234
We'll go together
to his warehouse in Albania.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.153
OK?

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:32.115
If I don't report in by tomorrow,

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:37.662
my people and the entire Greek police
will be down on you like a load of bricks.

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:39.163
Don't worry.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:42.333
By tomorrow we'll be good friends.

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:46.879
Let us drink to that.

01:13:48.173 --> 01:13:50.174
I'll wait till tomorrow.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.229
You may need this.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:07.150
I am a good judge of men.

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:12.155
Mr Bond, you have
what the Greeks call thrassos.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:14.031
Guts.

01:14:15.909 --> 01:14:17.869
So have you, Mr Columbo.

01:14:26.378 --> 01:14:27.670
Cheers.

01:15:08.253 --> 01:15:09.462
Locque!

01:16:28.667 --> 01:16:29.959
Watch it!

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:37.592
Santos. Nikos.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:50.229
JIM diving equipment for salvage work
at depths of more than 300 feet.

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.412
Raw opium.

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:10.875
An old smugglers' trick.
Kristatos knows them all.

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:55.086
Get your men out of here.

01:17:55.587 --> 01:17:56.671
Now!

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:02.838
You left this with Ferrara, I believe.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.567
He had no head for heights.

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:57.786
- Where did the St. Georges sink?
- We can't be sure for certain.

01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:02.458
It was in this vicinity.
Your father used the temple as a front.

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:08.505
Kristatos killed him
so he wouldn't find the St. Georges first.

01:22:11.384 --> 01:22:12.968
How can I help?

01:22:13.678 --> 01:22:16.764
Where did your father keep his records,
his daily log?

01:22:16.848 --> 01:22:18.682
Daily log! Daily log!

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:22.645
Father and he were pals for 30 years!
He repeats everything.

01:22:26.316 --> 01:22:27.858
Give us a kiss!

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.569
- What's his name?
- Max.

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:32.696
- Max.
- Thank you.

01:22:35.742 --> 01:22:36.992
Hello!

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:44.124
- It's all shorthand.
- He used a special kind.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:47.086
I was the only one who could decipher it.

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:53.342
He made several surveys in Neptune.

01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:56.637
- What's Neptune?
- Our two-man submarine.

01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:01.433
According to this,
he saw a diving bell here.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:02.893
Diving bell?

01:23:03.687 --> 01:23:06.522
Oil exploration, Kristatos.

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:12.653
Three days later, he sighted
a wreck in the same area.

01:23:13.947 --> 01:23:15.072
And?

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.909
That was his last entry.
The day he was killed.

01:23:21.871 --> 01:23:26.000
Air would be useless at this depth.
We'd need a mix of oxygen and helium.

01:23:26.084 --> 01:23:29.003
I have all the necessary
equipment aboard.

01:23:29.921 --> 01:23:32.506
The less people that know about this,
the better.

01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:36.135
I'll give the crew shore leave,
except the mate and two others.

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:37.261
Let's go.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:10.771
584 feet. An oxygen-helium mix
at that depth gives us eight minutes.

01:25:10.855 --> 01:25:12.856
We'll have to work fast.

01:25:13.024 --> 01:25:16.193
Wouldn't the crew
have destroyed the transmitter?

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:19.780
Only if they'd had the chance
to set the explosive timer.

01:25:51.521 --> 01:25:53.438
We have a visitor below.

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:04.825
Conserve your gas supply.
Speak only when necessary.

01:26:56.336 --> 01:26:58.420
I hope he was dining alone.

01:27:23.613 --> 01:27:26.990
- You'd better go back to the sub.
- No, I'm staying.

01:27:38.336 --> 01:27:40.796
That should be the command cabin.

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:03.694
Eureka!

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:17.124
Main destruct timer under lever
right of ATAC housing

01:28:17.208 --> 01:28:22.963
dualled by ring-mained circuit
through anti-handling charger.

01:28:23.214 --> 01:28:28.093
The destruct timer's set at one minute.
For some reason, the lever wasn't pulled.

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:37.269
The transmitter with a thermite charge.

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.204
Hold these.

01:28:57.248 --> 01:29:01.084
To bypass trembler switch,
cut wires in following procedure.

01:29:04.213 --> 01:29:05.422
Cutters.

01:29:25.401 --> 01:29:26.818
Screwdriver.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:46.088
That's it. Let's get out of here.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.448
James, help!

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:53.697
- James, I won't make it.
- We both will.

01:30:58.661 --> 01:31:01.204
Get back to the sub fast. I'll stall him.

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:25.867
- Try and close the CO2!
- I'm trying.

01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:58.334
Careful, James! It's 5,000 years old.

01:36:38.375 --> 01:36:42.253
Thank you, Mr Bond.
Now we don't need to disarm it!

01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:44.464
Apostis, take that.

01:36:47.843 --> 01:36:51.721
- Where are the men I left on board?
- You will soon join them.

01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:56.935
Let the girl go.
And we'll double whatever you're getting.

01:36:57.394 --> 01:37:01.731
I never go back on a deal.
It would be bad for my reputation.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.627
I will deliver it
and return with the money.

01:37:22.711 --> 01:37:27.966
The voice of the KGB! Our agreement was
to meet in a place designated by me!

01:37:29.093 --> 01:37:32.262
After they pay,
they can have the transmitter.

01:37:32.763 --> 01:37:37.767
- It must not go out of your sight, Apostis.
- Or mine. Where are we going?

01:37:38.143 --> 01:37:40.728
We will take the ATAC to St. Cyril's.

01:37:40.813 --> 01:37:43.439
St. Cyril's? I'll arrange the pick-up.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:55.159
Bind that wound.
We don't want any blood in the water.

01:37:55.744 --> 01:37:57.579
- Not yet.
- Murderer.

01:37:58.414 --> 01:38:01.499
You have shot your last bolt,
Miss Havelock.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.799
Leave the legs free.
They'll make appetising bait.

01:38:19.643 --> 01:38:23.354
- I didn't think it would end like this.
- We're not dead yet.

01:38:50.341 --> 01:38:51.674
Hold tight.

01:39:17.242 --> 01:39:19.243
Turn around. We go again.

01:39:24.917 --> 01:39:26.668
Take a deep breath!

01:40:22.683 --> 01:40:24.100
Once again!

01:41:17.780 --> 01:41:19.030
Leave him.

01:41:21.492 --> 01:41:23.284
Kurt, run them down.

01:41:41.678 --> 01:41:43.012
Follow me!

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:30.518
The sharks have them. Make port.

01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:55.293
Thank you.

01:42:55.377 --> 01:42:56.544
Hello.

01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:01.966
- Give us a kiss!
- Max, not now!

01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.761
Kristatos is still alive.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:09.724
He's probably on his way
to Moscow or Havana by now.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:13.686
- We'll never get him.
- Or the ATAC.

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:17.064
ATAC to St. Cyril's. ATAC to St. Cyril's.

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.946
ATAC to St. Cyril's.

01:44:31.306 --> 01:44:34.141
Forgive me, father, for I have sinned.

01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:36.644
That's putting it mildly, 007.

01:44:37.813 --> 01:44:40.439
Your signal sent Whitehall into shock.

01:44:41.024 --> 01:44:47.196
So far we've managed to locate
439 St. Cyril's in Greece.

01:44:47.864 --> 01:44:51.367
Heaven only knows to which one
Kristatos took the ATAC!

01:44:52.035 --> 01:44:55.371
I know a well-informed person
to contact about that, Q.

01:45:09.678 --> 01:45:12.972
St. Cyril's, where we used to hide
from the Germans.

01:45:13.557 --> 01:45:17.810
Only Kristatos would make an abandoned
monastery his personal retreat.

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:23.816
I've been studying this place for years
for just such an occasion.

01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.569
We'll split here.

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:30.740
Your best approach will be on
the right face, away from the buildings.

01:45:30.824 --> 01:45:36.329
Then make for the shed on the left
which houses the basket and winch.

01:45:36.872 --> 01:45:39.582
It can be operated only from the shed.

01:45:40.292 --> 01:45:41.709
Good luck.

01:45:51.428 --> 01:45:53.054
Should have brought more people.

01:45:53.138 --> 01:45:56.557
- James is counting on surprise.
- But we are only five men.

01:45:56.641 --> 01:45:58.225
And one woman.

01:46:50.195 --> 01:46:51.695
18.

01:46:51.780 --> 01:46:53.114
19.

01:46:53.365 --> 01:46:54.615
20.

01:46:55.867 --> 01:46:57.868
- 50 more.
- This is the pits!

01:46:57.953 --> 01:47:00.413
I'm supposed to be skating in Oslo!

01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:03.207
In Innsbruck.
Why are we in this creepy place?

01:47:03.291 --> 01:47:07.461
Our plans are changed! We are going
to live in Cuba for a few months.

01:47:07.879 --> 01:47:08.879
Cuba?

01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:12.425
You can skate privately.
I will be your audience.

01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:14.468
What a drag that'll be!

01:47:14.553 --> 01:47:16.679
I wanna win the gold medal!

01:47:16.763 --> 01:47:19.890
- We all want that.
- I know what you want!

01:47:19.975 --> 01:47:23.269
But you're too old for me.
I'm splitting.

01:47:24.354 --> 01:47:27.106
You have poisoned her against me!

01:47:27.858 --> 01:47:30.443
Don't blow your top, Ari. Leave her alone!

01:47:30.527 --> 01:47:32.987
I will deal with you, Jacoba Brink,

01:47:33.071 --> 01:47:35.739
as I deal with everyone who betrays me.

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:46.333
Bibi,

01:47:47.252 --> 01:47:48.878
you're so young.

01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:52.840
You must have a sponsor.

01:47:53.008 --> 01:47:54.884
I'll find another one.

01:47:55.218 --> 01:47:59.221
Check the guards. Let me know
as soon as the helicopter arrives.

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:16.330
Apostis. One of Kristatos' killers.

01:56:00.244 --> 01:56:01.662
Shut him up!

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:08.293
Get the door.

01:56:18.554 --> 01:56:21.515
Hurry, unless you want me
to go without you.

01:56:21.599 --> 01:56:24.142
You know I will never leave you.

01:56:27.772 --> 01:56:29.606
Your general is late!

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:32.818
Only bad weather would delay him.

01:56:47.208 --> 01:56:48.834
Cover the windows!

01:56:49.293 --> 01:56:50.585
Let's go!

01:56:51.462 --> 01:56:53.463
He's all right, leave him.

01:57:01.347 --> 01:57:02.806
He's all right.

01:57:03.266 --> 01:57:04.349
Back!

01:57:13.943 --> 01:57:15.444
OK, let's go!

01:57:16.029 --> 01:57:17.654
I'll be with you.

01:57:18.448 --> 01:57:19.489
Sorry.

01:57:32.045 --> 01:57:33.587
Cover the door!

01:57:34.797 --> 01:57:37.466
Where's Kristatos?
And keep your voice down!

01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:40.969
We are leaving him.
He must not know until we are gone.

01:57:41.262 --> 01:57:43.472
We'll help you if you help us.

01:57:45.850 --> 01:57:46.975
Come.

01:57:57.820 --> 01:58:00.655
- Where are the guards?
- That way.

01:58:53.084 --> 01:58:54.126
Move!

01:58:58.381 --> 01:59:01.800
- Where's Kristatos?
- The other side of the courtyard.

01:59:01.884 --> 01:59:03.844
You'd better stay here.

01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:15.480
Where's Brink?
What have you done to her?

01:59:15.565 --> 01:59:17.858
- Go back to your room!
- Go to hell!

01:59:51.225 --> 01:59:52.434
Drop it.

02:01:15.685 --> 02:01:18.687
- Where's Kristatos?
- He left with the ATAC.

02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:31.825
You're going to pay for it!

02:01:47.341 --> 02:01:51.720
No, Melina. That's not the answer.
We'll turn him over to the police.

02:01:52.179 --> 02:01:54.055
Out of my way, James!

02:01:54.890 --> 02:01:59.227
All right. But be prepared
to dig those two graves.

02:02:37.099 --> 02:02:39.225
That's détente, comrade.

02:02:39.477 --> 02:02:42.103
You don't have it, I don't have it.

02:03:15.805 --> 02:03:18.515
Seems as though Bibi has a new sponsor.

02:03:28.734 --> 02:03:32.737
- How's it going?
- I patched through a line to the satellite.

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:35.156
- We can try Bond now.
- Good.

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:38.743
- Are you through to Number 10?
- Standing by, sir.

02:03:42.915 --> 02:03:44.833
You know what I'd like?

02:03:46.335 --> 02:03:48.086
I can't imagine.

02:03:48.796 --> 02:03:50.547
A moonlight swim.

02:03:54.969 --> 02:03:56.719
007, are you there?

02:04:07.106 --> 02:04:09.107
Bond, are you there?

02:04:11.235 --> 02:04:13.403
For your eyes only, darling.

02:04:19.577 --> 02:04:22.537
- He's there!
- Patch in the Prime Minister.

02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.750
I'll get it, Denis.

02:04:31.130 --> 02:04:34.048
- Hello?
- Mr Bond, Prime Minister.

02:04:35.468 --> 02:04:36.759
Mr Bond,

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:41.181
I wanted to call you personally
to say how pleased we all are

02:04:41.265 --> 02:04:44.184
that your mission was a success.
Thank you.

02:04:44.435 --> 02:04:45.935
Thank you. Thank you.

02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:50.273
Don't thank me, Mr Bond.
Your courage and resourcefulness

02:04:50.357 --> 02:04:52.525
are a credit to the nation.

02:04:53.152 --> 02:04:55.361
Denis and I look forward
to meeting you.

02:04:55.446 --> 02:04:58.198
If there is anything I can do for you...

02:04:58.282 --> 02:05:01.910
- Give us a kiss! Give us a kiss!
- Really, Mr Bond!

02:05:03.537 --> 02:05:06.748
I think we're having
