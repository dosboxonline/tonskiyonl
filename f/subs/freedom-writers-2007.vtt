<i>There have been shots fired.</i>

00:34.834 --> 00:36.825
<i>Total civil unrest is happening
throughout the Los Angeles area.</i>

00:36.936 --> 00:37.567
<i>Dozens of police
are running down the streets.</i>

00:37.602 --> 00:38.199
<i>Dozens of police
are running down the streets.</i>

00:38.338 --> 00:39.464
<i>Smoke reigned over the entire city.</i>

00:39.606 --> 00:42.575
<i>We're telling anybody
who's in downtown South Central...</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:44.233
<i>There are 38 dead and more than...</i>

00:44.377 --> 00:46.504
<i>The EMT are having
a hard time getting in...</i>

00:49.349 --> 00:52.785
<i>...where truck driver Reginald Denny
was pulled from his vehicle...</i>

00:54.654 --> 00:56.417
<i>The city resembles a war zone.</i>

00:56.523 --> 00:58.150
<i>Crowds gathered
at Parker Center downtown.</i>

00:58.258 --> 01:01.250
<i>...here in Hollywood, where
looters have struck many businesses.</i>

01:01.361 --> 01:03.829
<i>There have been 3,600 structural fires.</i>

01:04.563 --> 01:06.361
<i>Thick, black smoke rising
from the countless fires</i>

01:06.466 --> 01:11.995
<i>in Hollywood, downtown, Compton,
Watts and Long Beach...</i>

01:30.890 --> 01:32.187
<i>In America,</i>

01:33.193 --> 01:35.457
<i>a girl can be crowned a princess</i>

01:36.362 --> 01:39.763
<i>for her beauty and her grace.</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:46.098
<i>But an Aztec princess
is chosen for her blood...</i>

01:46.473 --> 01:47.565
Eva?

01:51.077 --> 01:53.705
<i>...to fight for her people,
as Papi and his father fought</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.441
<i>against those who say
we are less than they are,</i>

01:56.549 --> 01:59.848
<i>who say we are not equal in beauty
and in blessings.</i>

02:07.627 --> 02:09.526
<i>It was the first day of school,</i>

02:09.628 --> 02:12.393
<i>and I was waiting for my father
to take me to the bus.</i>

02:12.499 --> 02:13.727
Roberto!

02:18.304 --> 02:19.271
Eva!

02:20.073 --> 02:22.701
<i>And I saw the war for the first time.</i>

02:23.643 --> 02:25.611
Eva! Eva!

02:25.912 --> 02:27.539
Police! Open up!

02:29.716 --> 02:32.014
<i>They took my father for retaliation.</i>

02:32.418 --> 02:33.817
<i>He was innocent, but they took him,</i>

02:33.920 --> 02:36.252
<i>because he was respected
by my people.</i>

02:36.356 --> 02:40.486
<i>They called my people a gang
because we fight for our America.</i>

02:40.793 --> 02:42.055
On your feet!

02:43.963 --> 02:46.329
<i>When I got my initiation
into the gang life,</i>

02:46.432 --> 02:48.559
<i>I became third generation.</i>

02:49.569 --> 02:51.969
<i>They beat you so you won't break.</i>

02:53.540 --> 02:55.303
<i>They are my family.</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:04.480
<i>In Long Beach, it all comes down
to what you look like.</i>

03:04.584 --> 03:07.417
<i>If you're Latino or Asian or black,</i>

03:07.520 --> 03:36.316
<i>you could get blasted any time
you walk out your door.</i>

03:36.351 --> 03:38.181
<i>We fight each other for territory.</i>

03:38.284 --> 03:41.776
<i>We kill each other over race,
pride and respect.</i>

03:43.056 --> 03:45.115
<i>We fight for what is ours.</i>

03:49.429 --> 03:51.795
<i>They think they're winning
by jumping me now,</i>

03:51.898 --> 03:54.196
<i>but soon they're all going down.</i>

03:54.934 --> 03:56.834
<i>War has been declared.</i>

03:58.304 --> 04:00.329
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.637
I brought my lesson plans.
I'd love it if you'd look them over.

04:06.746 --> 04:10.307
Yes, and these are the classes
you'll start with.

04:10.416 --> 04:14.876
Freshman English, four classes,
about 150 students in all.

04:19.591 --> 04:21.355
Some of them
are just out of juvenile hall.

04:21.461 --> 04:25.295
One or two might be wearing ankle cuffs
to monitor their whereabouts.

04:25.398 --> 04:28.367
And you see here,
we'll have to revise your lesson plans.

04:28.501 --> 04:32.335
And if you look at their scores,
these vocabulary lists

04:32.438 --> 04:36.340
<i>and some of these, the books,
Homer's The Odyssey,</i>

04:36.442 --> 04:38.034
they're gonna be too difficult for them.

04:38.177 --> 04:39.144
All right.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.170
Also, for most of them to get here

04:41.281 --> 04:43.545
it takes three buses,
almost 90 minutes each way.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.639
My God.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.480
So I wouldn't give them too much
of a homework load.

04:46.586 --> 04:49.350
You'll just be wasting a lot of time
following up on overdue work.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.252
All right. Thank you.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.659
- You're from Newport Beach?
- Yes.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.530
It's too bad you weren't here
even two years ago, you know.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.935
We used to have one of the highest
scholastic records in the district,

05:04.037 --> 05:07.598
but since voluntary integration
was suggested,

05:07.740 --> 05:14.009
we've lost over 75ยบ/ยบ
of our strongest students.

05:14.113 --> 05:17.571
Well, actually, I chose Wilson
because of the integration program.

05:17.684 --> 05:20.778
I think what's happening here
is really exciting, don't you?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.355
My father was involved
in the civil rights movement.

05:23.456 --> 05:26.892
And I remember when I was watching
the LA riots on TV,

05:26.993 --> 05:28.756
I was thinking of going
to law school at the time.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.590
And I thought, "God, by the time

05:30.697 --> 05:33.131
"you're defending a kid in a courtroom,
the battle's already lost. "

05:33.232 --> 05:36.861
I think the real fighting
should happen here in the classroom.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.037
Well, that's a very

05:43.042 --> 05:45.010
well-thought-out phrase.

05:47.513 --> 05:48.639
Erin,

05:49.449 --> 05:53.579
I think you're a lovely, intelligent woman.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.681
But you're a first-time teacher.

05:56.789 --> 05:58.984
As head of this department,
I have to be confident

05:59.092 --> 06:01.560
you're capable of dealing
with what we have to face here.

06:01.661 --> 06:02.855
I am.

06:03.429 --> 06:06.694
I know I have a lot to learn as a teacher,
but I'm a really good student.

06:06.799 --> 06:10.963
I am, and I really want to be here.

06:15.808 --> 06:20.336
- Those are lovely pearls.
- Thank you. From my father.

06:21.814 --> 06:23.509
I wouldn't wear them to class.

06:39.098 --> 06:40.395
Honey?

06:43.669 --> 06:44.761
What?

06:46.439 --> 06:48.134
Do I look like a teacher?

07:05.458 --> 07:06.516
Hey!

08:31.043 --> 08:33.273
Hey, Chris, yo, what up?

08:49.495 --> 08:51.520
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.630
Hey, yo, let's sit right here, man.

09:00.973 --> 09:01.997
Hi.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.973
Hey, girl, you wanna give me
some fries with that shake?

09:42.848 --> 09:46.750
My name is Erin Gruwell.
Welcome to Freshman English.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.248
<i>I give this bitch a week.</i>

09:49.355 --> 09:50.379
Hi.

09:52.858 --> 09:55.725
Okay. Brandy Ross?

09:55.828 --> 09:57.557
Gloria Munez.

09:59.899 --> 10:02.026
Alejandro Santiago.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.000
Andre Bryant.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.701
Eva Benitez.

10:09.809 --> 10:13.472
Eva, not Eva.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.109
Eva.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.418
I have to go to the bathroom.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.749
- Okay, make sure that you take a...
- Yeah, I know.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.022
Ben Samuels?

10:28.761 --> 10:31.127
<i>That white boy hoping
he's in the wrong room.</i>

10:31.230 --> 10:32.492
<i>I gotta get out of here.</i>

10:32.598 --> 10:35.658
- Sindy Ngor.
- Right here.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.063
Is that correct?

10:37.570 --> 10:40.266
- Jamal Hill?
- Man, what am I doing in here?

10:40.706 --> 10:42.503
This whole ghetto-ass class
has got people in here

10:42.608 --> 10:44.576
<i>looking like a bad rerun of Cops
and shit.</i>

10:44.710 --> 10:46.541
You know what I'm saying? It's true.

10:46.646 --> 10:49.206
- Are you Jamal?
- Yeah.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.079
Well, for some reason
they have you registered in this class.

10:52.184 --> 10:55.210
- Yeah, and that's some bullshit.
- It's the dumb class, coz.

10:55.888 --> 10:57.446
It means you're too dumb.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.692
- Man, say it to my face, coz.
- I just did.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.489
See what I mean? Dumb.

11:02.595 --> 11:04.927
- Man, I know you ain't talking to me!
- Okay...

11:05.031 --> 11:06.589
Look, homey,
I'll beat that ass, homeboy.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.757
Can you please sit back down?

11:07.867 --> 11:08.834
Look, I got your spot on the team.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.265
That's why you're over there
wagging your tongue.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.631
Please sit back in your seats.

11:11.771 --> 11:14.365
Look, your spot is good as gone. I don't
know why you keep wasting your time

11:14.507 --> 11:17.305
coming to practice with them
two-year-old Nikes on your feet!

11:17.410 --> 11:19.401
You don't know nothing about me, coz!

11:20.579 --> 11:21.705
Broke down my whole situation.

11:21.814 --> 11:22.872
Jamal?

11:22.982 --> 11:23.949
So, now you're in my face now, right?

11:24.350 --> 11:25.874
Sit your punk ass down!
Sit your punk ass down, homeboy!

11:25.985 --> 11:26.974
I will run that ass off the field.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.610
Shut your ass up. What's up, homey?

11:28.721 --> 11:30.279
I mean, what's up?
Sit your ass down, homey!

11:30.456 --> 11:32.356
Excuse me,
may I please get some help in here?

11:34.894 --> 11:36.589
So do something! Back up!

11:36.696 --> 11:37.685
You touching me now?

11:37.797 --> 11:40.231
Sit down, homeboy. Back up,
I'm not gonna tell you again.

11:40.332 --> 11:41.526
You gonna look at my face now, right?

11:41.667 --> 11:42.929
You ain't taking nothing
from me, homeboy!

11:43.302 --> 11:44.929
I will run your ass off the field!

11:45.071 --> 11:46.163
Boy, sit your ass back down.

11:46.305 --> 11:47.966
Don't even worry about it,
I'm gonna see you.

11:48.107 --> 11:49.369
Tell him. Sit his ass down.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.567
Sit your ass down.

11:50.676 --> 11:52.644
Thank you. Let him out of here, man.
That's some bullshit.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.376
Erin?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.193
Erin, this is Brian Gelford.

12:08.294 --> 12:11.092
He teaches Junior English
and the Distinguished Honors Classes.

12:11.197 --> 12:13.995
- Hi. Erin Gruwell. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

12:14.100 --> 12:18.867
- You saw a little action today, I hear.
- Yeah. It happened so fast.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.895
Well, don't be discouraged.

12:21.040 --> 12:24.203
You put your time in, in a few years,
you'll be able to teach juniors.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.504
They're a pleasure.

12:25.611 --> 12:28.273
By then, most of your kids
will be gone anyway.

12:28.380 --> 12:33.113
- What do you mean?
- Well, eventually, they just stop coming.

12:34.920 --> 12:39.084
Well, if I do my job,
they might be lining up at the door.

12:39.692 --> 12:40.989
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.795
- Nice pearls.
- Thank you.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.212
<i>If it was up to me,
I wouldn't even be in school.</i>

13:02.314 --> 13:04.214
<i>My probation officer threatened me,</i>

13:04.316 --> 13:06.841
<i>telling me it was either school
or boot camp.</i>

13:07.186 --> 13:08.312
<i>Dumbass.</i>

13:08.420 --> 13:10.320
<i>He thinks that the problems
going on in Long Beach</i>

13:10.422 --> 13:12.549
<i>aren't going to touch me at Wilson.</i>

13:13.526 --> 13:16.552
<i>My PO doesn't understand
that schools are like the city,</i>

13:16.662 --> 13:18.721
<i>and the city is just like a prison,</i>

13:18.831 --> 13:23.131
<i>all of them divided into
separate sections, depending on tribes.</i>

13:23.536 --> 13:25.299
<i>There's Little Cambodia.</i>

13:26.305 --> 13:27.738
<i>The Ghetto.</i>

13:28.007 --> 13:29.634
<i>Wonder Bread Land.</i>

13:30.042 --> 13:34.103
<i>And us,
South of the Border or Little Tijuana.</i>

13:34.413 --> 13:37.246
<i>That's just the way it is,
and everyone knows it.</i>

13:37.950 --> 13:41.442
<i>But soon enough, you have little
wannabes trying to hit you up at school,</i>

13:41.554 --> 13:43.852
<i>demanding respect they haven't earned.</i>

13:44.490 --> 13:48.688
<i>It looks like this, one tribe drifting
quietly to another's territory</i>

13:48.794 --> 13:52.423
<i>without respect,
as if to claim what isn't theirs.</i>

13:53.265 --> 13:57.668
<i>An outsider looking in
would never see it, but we could feel it.</i>

14:01.073 --> 14:02.802
<i>Something was coming.</i>

14:18.591 --> 14:19.751
Settle down.

14:19.859 --> 14:23.727
Let's go over the first name
on the list, Homer.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.725
<i>Homer's The Odyssey.</i>

14:26.832 --> 14:28.527
I know Homer the Simpson.

14:29.835 --> 14:32.497
No, this Homer was an ancient Greek,

14:32.638 --> 14:35.903
but maybe he was bald
just like Homer Simpson.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.372
Okay.

14:51.657 --> 14:53.022
What's up?

15:01.367 --> 15:03.358
Quietly, please.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.567
Mrs. Gruwell,
he just took my damn bag!

15:07.673 --> 15:09.004
Shut up!
Ain't nobody touched your damn bag.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.097
Yeah, I saw you.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.301
Jamal. Jamal. Get her backpack.

15:12.411 --> 15:13.742
I didn't do nothing anyway!

15:13.846 --> 15:15.006
- Jamal. Jamal.
- Okay.

15:31.563 --> 15:35.932
Wait! Wait! Please, stay in your seats!
Wait! Stay in your seats! Please!

15:51.383 --> 15:53.044
Slanty-eyed bitch!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.118
<i>Return to your classrooms.</i>

16:01.427 --> 16:04.021
<i>Return to the classrooms immediately.</i>

16:08.300 --> 16:09.892
That's all you got?

16:11.203 --> 16:15.037
<i>Clear the school lawn
and the recreation field now!</i>

16:19.411 --> 16:22.972
<i>...classrooms, or you will be subject
to disciplinary action.</i>

16:24.316 --> 16:27.479
<i>You can best help yourself
and your fellow students</i>

16:27.586 --> 16:31.215
<i>and your school by returning
to your classrooms now.</i>

16:31.457 --> 16:33.755
<i>Please return to your classrooms.</i>

16:33.993 --> 16:35.620
Get up, bitch!

16:36.628 --> 16:40.155
<i>All students must return
to their classrooms immediately.</i>

16:43.135 --> 16:44.193
Erin?

16:46.805 --> 16:47.863
Erin.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.538
Hey, baby.

16:52.544 --> 16:53.841
You okay?

16:54.113 --> 16:55.080
Come here.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.083
Are you sure about this?

17:00.252 --> 17:03.483
Well, it's not exactly how I pictured it.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.520
Don't tell my dad.

17:08.227 --> 17:10.354
Hopefully, he hasn't seen the news.

17:13.898 --> 17:16.492
- So, how's work?
- Dad.

17:17.102 --> 17:20.265
- I was asking your husband.
- It's good. I mean, for now.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.531
It's a good company.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.607
I pretty much run
the computer data department.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.008
- I thought you were an architect.
- He is. He's just taking a break.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.807
And the money's good for now.

17:28.914 --> 17:32.518
How much are you making,
$27,000 before taxes?

17:32.553 --> 17:34.213
If you know, why are you asking?

17:34.319 --> 17:36.150
So, what's everybody gonna eat?

17:36.255 --> 17:39.281
With your brains,
you could run a major corporation.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.087
Instead, I worry all night
because you're a teacher at Attica.

17:42.194 --> 17:44.162
Can you hear what you're saying?

17:44.263 --> 17:47.824
How many times have I listened to you
about walking civil rights marches?

17:47.933 --> 17:50.731
These gangs are criminals,
not activists. You read the papers?

17:50.869 --> 17:52.700
They said the same thing
about the Black Panthers.

17:52.838 --> 17:54.772
I'll lay odds your kids don't even know

17:54.873 --> 17:56.932
who Rap Brown
or Eldridge Cleaver were.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.737
You're gonna waste your talents
on people

17:58.844 --> 18:01.312
who don't give a damn about education.

18:02.781 --> 18:04.510
It breaks my heart.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.010
I tell you the truth.

18:07.419 --> 18:08.511
Well...

18:10.622 --> 18:13.557
I'm sorry. I can't help that.

18:17.830 --> 18:21.129
- You think this is good enough for her?
- Yeah, I do.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.634
Look, Steve,

18:24.236 --> 18:27.205
if Erin thinks she can teach these kids,
she can.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.741
You telling her she can't
is just gonna make her mad.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.711
So he doesn't like your job. So what?
Why do you let it get to you?

18:40.819 --> 18:43.922
I don't know, it just does.
I'm not used to disappointing him. I...

18:43.957 --> 18:45.150
Just let me know
when I can brush my teeth.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.316
- I hate that we don't have our own sinks.
- Come in. There's room.

18:47.426 --> 18:48.654
All right. Thank you.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.888
I can't believe he brought up my salary.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.762
What's happened to him?

18:53.866 --> 18:56.130
He was like Atticus Finch to me
when I was growing up,

18:56.268 --> 18:59.863
and now he's talking about salaries?
I think he's playing too much golf.

19:00.072 --> 19:02.506
In fact, I think he needs an intervention.

19:03.041 --> 19:05.009
Why isn't being a teacher
good enough for him?

19:05.110 --> 19:06.839
Honey, just calm down.

19:06.945 --> 19:10.210
You know, except for marrying me,

19:10.315 --> 19:12.875
you never seriously disappoint him.
He worships you.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.316
He likes you. He just doesn't...

19:14.419 --> 19:16.614
He just doesn't think
I'm good enough for you, which is fine.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.589
That's what fathers do.
I'm sure I'll be that way someday.

19:19.691 --> 19:24.151
Look, just, you know, stop worrying
about being his perfect daughter.

19:24.263 --> 19:26.823
You don't live in his house,
you live in ours.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.559
Or until we find one.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.729
- Or until you build us one.
- Yeah.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.197
With extra sinks.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.481
You're a teacher
because you say you are.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.894
I have this idea.

20:03.101 --> 20:06.901
We're gonna be covering poetry.
Who here likes Tupac Shakur?

20:07.005 --> 20:07.994
It's 2Pac.

20:08.140 --> 20:11.371
2Pac Shakur. Excuse me.
Raise your hand.

20:12.878 --> 20:15.574
Really? I thought there'd be more fans.

20:15.914 --> 20:18.314
I have the lyrics to this song printed out.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.147
I want you to listen to this phrase
I have up on the board.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.847
It's an example of an internal rhyme.

20:23.956 --> 20:28.450
What he does is
very sophisticated and cool, actually.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.495
"Man-child in the promised land
couldn't afford many heroes

20:31.597 --> 20:33.963
"Moms was the only one there
Pops was a no-show

20:34.066 --> 20:37.365
"And, no, I guess you didn't know
that I would grow to be so strong

20:37.502 --> 20:39.936
"You looking kinda pale, was it the ale?
Oh, pops was wrong

20:40.038 --> 20:42.404
"Where was the money that you said
you would send me?

20:42.507 --> 20:44.805
"Talked on the phone
and you sounded so friendly"

20:44.910 --> 20:47.879
- Think we don't know 2Pac?
- White girl gonna teach us about rap.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.005
No, it's not that.
See, what I was trying to do...

20:50.115 --> 20:52.982
You have no idea
what you're doing up there, do you?

20:53.919 --> 20:55.978
You ever been a teacher before?

20:56.722 --> 20:58.451
And teacher gets nailed, y'all!

20:58.557 --> 21:01.958
All right, Jamal, enough.
Jamal! That's enough!

21:02.494 --> 21:05.759
You know what? I want you to move
to this front seat right here now.

21:05.864 --> 21:08.162
- What?
- Come on.

21:09.368 --> 21:12.235
I am sick of these antics
in my classroom.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.240
Well, there you are.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.002
I was wondering when
you were gonna lose that damn smile.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.407
Switch with Ben.

21:19.511 --> 21:22.036
- Come on.
- I can't go back there alone.

21:22.147 --> 21:24.138
- It'll be fine.
- No, it won't.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.341
I'm not sitting near him.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.678
I ain't going up there without my homey.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.116
I'm not sitting back there alone!

21:28.220 --> 21:29.517
- All right.
- Shut up.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.713
All right, you know what?

21:30.822 --> 21:33.290
I want you all to move
to this side of the room.

21:33.392 --> 21:36.520
You in the back, up here.
Sindy and all of you, move to the back.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.790
Come on. Let's go. Now!

21:43.235 --> 21:44.998
Get your ass back to China, all of y'all.

21:47.706 --> 21:51.039
- You're all little midget-ass punks.
- Move before I stomp your peanuts.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.109
Boo!

21:59.851 --> 22:01.819
Get your ass to the back, boy.

22:23.809 --> 22:25.208
Get off my desk.

22:35.153 --> 22:36.916
So, everybody happy
with the new borders?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.160
Eva?

22:47.332 --> 22:48.959
Where are you going?

22:49.101 --> 22:50.432
Hey! Hey!

25:05.403 --> 25:07.462
This is bull! Come on, man! What the...

25:09.808 --> 25:11.776
What the hell? Damn!

25:13.578 --> 25:15.170
I want my money back!

25:17.582 --> 25:21.143
This shit took my damn money!
I want my damn money back!

25:22.053 --> 25:23.748
Look what you putting me through. Shit!

25:23.922 --> 25:26.652
Learn to speak the damn language!
You're from this country, aren't you?

25:26.758 --> 25:28.555
I want my money back!

25:28.927 --> 25:29.905
I want my money back!

25:29.940 --> 25:30.884
I want my money back!

25:53.652 --> 25:55.119
Come on! Let's go!

25:58.823 --> 26:00.518
Come on, come on, girl! Let's go!

26:23.748 --> 26:25.375
<i>Paco was scared.</i>

26:25.617 --> 26:27.107
<i>In the car, he said,</i>

26:27.218 --> 26:30.187
<i>"You can't go against your own people,
your own blood. "</i>

26:30.288 --> 26:33.825
<i>The same words
my father used so many times.</i>

26:33.860 --> 26:35.452
<i>Only I saw Paco.</i>

26:35.760 --> 26:37.352
<i>The others were turned away.</i>

26:37.462 --> 26:41.660
<i>So when the police questioned me,
I knew I had to protect him.</i>

26:45.637 --> 26:49.073
All right, everyone, we need to get
started so classes won't be too delayed.

26:49.174 --> 26:51.108
Principal Banning
would like to say something

26:51.209 --> 26:53.177
in the light of last night's events.

26:53.311 --> 26:55.074
I've spoken to the police.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.808
As you might already know,
there were persons involved

26:57.916 --> 27:01.317
in last night's shooting
who are Wilson students.

27:01.486 --> 27:05.388
Grant Rice has been arrested
as a prime suspect.

27:05.423 --> 27:06.856
Ms. Gruwell,

27:06.958 --> 27:10.689
apparently one of your students,
Eva Benitez...

27:10.795 --> 27:13.889
- Eva.
... has identified him as the shooter.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.399
She's the prime witness in the case.

27:16.534 --> 27:20.664
It is our policy not to discuss
the subject inside the classroom.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.773
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.286
Hey, Tiny, check this out.

27:49.267 --> 27:52.168
Hey. Hey!

28:08.119 --> 28:09.245
Yes?

28:11.156 --> 28:12.521
All right.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.250
Gloria?

28:15.860 --> 28:17.487
Please read the first sentence
on the board.

28:17.595 --> 28:18.584
Why me?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.562
Because I know
how much you love to read.

28:20.665 --> 28:22.394
Close the magazine.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.066
"Odysseus had no sense of direction. "

28:28.206 --> 28:30.174
Now, none of these sentences
are correct.

28:30.308 --> 28:33.766
I'd like you to rewrite these sentences
using the proper tenses

28:33.912 --> 28:36.380
and spelling on page four
of your workbooks.

28:42.353 --> 28:45.422
I don't have a page four. It got torn out.

28:45.457 --> 28:48.949
Okay, why don't you just use
the next blank page?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.726
What's going on?

28:58.670 --> 29:00.900
What is that? Give it to me.

29:17.789 --> 29:20.223
- What is this?
- Just leave it alone.

29:26.464 --> 29:28.432
You think this is funny?

29:29.300 --> 29:30.426
Tito?

29:31.436 --> 29:34.098
Would this be funny
if it were a picture of you?

29:34.472 --> 29:35.769
It ain't.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.580
Close the workbooks.

29:55.059 --> 29:58.586
Maybe we should talk about art.
Tito's got real talent, don't you think?

29:58.696 --> 30:01.597
- Yeah, yeah.
- Go, Tito.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.126
You know something?

30:04.269 --> 30:08.000
I saw a picture just like this once
in a museum.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.374
Only it wasn't a black man,
it was a Jewish man.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.241
And instead of the big lips,
he had a really big nose,

30:15.346 --> 30:16.938
like a rat's nose.

30:17.048 --> 30:19.073
But he wasn't
just one particular Jewish man,

30:19.184 --> 30:21.379
this was a drawing of all Jews.

30:21.786 --> 30:24.016
And these drawings
were put in the newspapers

30:24.122 --> 30:26.613
by the most famous gang in history.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.551
That's us, dawg.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.528
You think you know all about gangs?

30:35.900 --> 30:37.492
You're amateurs.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.129
This gang would put you all to shame.

30:40.271 --> 30:44.537
And they started out poor and angry,
and everybody looked down on them.

30:44.642 --> 30:47.577
Until one man decided
to give them some pride,

30:47.679 --> 30:51.137
an identity and somebody to blame.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.851
You take over neighborhoods?

30:54.853 --> 30:59.153
That's nothing compared to them.
They took over countries.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.656
And you wanna know how?

31:01.125 --> 31:03.616
They just wiped out everybody else.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.592
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.097
Yeah, they wiped out
everybody they didn't like,

31:08.199 --> 31:11.327
and everybody they blamed
for their life being hard.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.097
And one of the ways they did it
was by doing this.

31:14.239 --> 31:16.730
See, they'd print pictures like this
in the newspapers.

31:16.875 --> 31:21.835
Jewish people with big, long noses.
Blacks with big, fat lips.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.580
They'd also publish scientific evidence

31:25.683 --> 31:29.915
that proved Jews and blacks
were the lowest form of human species.

31:30.855 --> 31:32.584
Jews and blacks
were more like animals.

31:32.690 --> 31:34.021
And because they were just like animals

31:34.125 --> 31:36.320
it didn't really matter
whether they lived or died.

31:36.427 --> 31:40.659
In fact, life would be a whole lot better
if they were all dead.

31:42.233 --> 31:44.531
That's how a holocaust happens.

31:44.769 --> 31:46.134
And that's what you all think
of each other.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.261
You don't know nothing, homegirl.

31:47.405 --> 31:49.873
No, I don't, Marcus!
So why don't you explain it to me?

31:50.008 --> 31:51.976
I ain't explaining shit to you!

31:53.611 --> 31:55.636
Do you even know how we live?

31:57.715 --> 31:59.273
We was here first, man.

31:59.884 --> 32:01.511
Just shut that shit up, homeboy.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.410
All right! All right! All right!

32:03.521 --> 32:05.819
So what you're saying is,
if the Latinos weren't here,

32:05.924 --> 32:08.950
or the Cambodians or the blacks
or the whites or whoever they are,

32:09.060 --> 32:11.688
if they weren't here, everything
would be better for you, isn't that right?

32:11.796 --> 32:13.263
Of course it'd be better!

32:14.165 --> 32:16.292
Lt'd be better if you weren't here.

32:17.368 --> 32:19.029
Right. Right.

32:20.405 --> 32:22.805
It starts with a drawing like this,

32:23.441 --> 32:26.569
and then some kid dies in a drive-by,
never even knowing what hit him.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.578
You don't know nothing!

32:30.248 --> 32:32.216
You don't know the pain we feel.

32:32.717 --> 32:34.412
You don't know what we got to do.

32:34.519 --> 32:36.646
You got no respect for how we living.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.279
You got us in here,
teaching us this grammar shit,

32:39.390 --> 32:40.516
and then we got to go out there again.

32:40.625 --> 32:43.116
And what are you telling me
about that, huh?

32:43.227 --> 32:46.924
What are you doing in here that makes
a goddamn difference to my life?

32:47.031 --> 32:50.262
You don't feel respected.
Is that what you're saying, Eva?

32:50.568 --> 32:54.004
Well, maybe you're not.
But to get respect, you have to give it.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.696
That's bullshit.

32:56.874 --> 32:57.841
What?

32:57.942 --> 33:00.035
Why should I give my respect to you?

33:00.178 --> 33:01.770
'Cause you're a teacher?

33:01.879 --> 33:03.210
I don't know you.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.715
How do I know
you're not a liar standing up there?

33:05.817 --> 33:08.911
How do I know you're not
a bad person standing up there?

33:09.520 --> 33:12.580
I'm not just gonna give you my respect
because you're called a teacher.

33:12.690 --> 33:16.786
White people always wanting their
respect like they deserve it for free.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.855
I'm a teacher.
It doesn't matter what color I am.

33:20.965 --> 33:22.796
It's all about color.

33:23.601 --> 33:25.899
It's about people deciding
what you deserve,

33:26.037 --> 33:28.301
about people wanting
what they don't deserve,

33:28.406 --> 33:30.738
about whites thinking
they run this world no matter what.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.742
You see, I hate white people.

33:34.379 --> 33:35.778
- You hate me?
- Yeah.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.974
- You don't know me.
- I know what you can do.

33:39.083 --> 33:42.883
I saw white cops shoot my friend
in the back for reaching into his pocket!

33:42.987 --> 33:44.215
His pocket.

33:44.722 --> 33:47.122
I saw white cops break into my house

33:47.225 --> 33:50.854
and take my father for no reason
except because they feel like it!

33:50.962 --> 33:53.055
Except because they can.

33:54.565 --> 33:57.762
And they can because they're white.

33:59.303 --> 34:01.737
So I hate white people on sight!

34:06.377 --> 34:08.777
Ben, do you have anything to say?

34:08.880 --> 34:10.643
Can I please get out of here?

34:10.748 --> 34:13.717
Lady, stop acting like you're trying
to understand our situation

34:13.818 --> 34:15.251
and just do your little babysitting
up there.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.650
- That's all you think this is?
- It ain't nothing else.

34:17.755 --> 34:18.915
When I look out in the world,

34:19.023 --> 34:21.491
I don't see nobody that looks like me
with their pockets full,

34:21.592 --> 34:24.083
unless they're rapping a lyric
or dribbling a ball.

34:24.195 --> 34:25.525
So what else you got in here for me?

34:25.630 --> 34:28.063
And what if you can't rap a lyric
or dribble a ball?

34:28.166 --> 34:31.761
- It ain't this. I know that much.
- Damn right.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.996
And you all think you're gonna make it
to graduation like this?

34:35.139 --> 34:36.902
I made it to high school.
Ain't nobody stopped me.

34:37.007 --> 34:39.976
Lady, I'm lucky if I make it to 18.
We in a war.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.705
We're graduating every day we live,

34:41.813 --> 34:44.110
because we ain't afraid to die
protecting our own.

34:44.215 --> 34:48.549
At least when you die for your own,
you die with respect, you die a warrior.

34:48.652 --> 34:49.677
That's right.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.483
So when you're dead, you'll get respect?
Is that what you think?

34:52.590 --> 34:53.648
- That's right.
- That's right.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.282
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

34:57.962 --> 35:00.430
You know what's gonna happen
when you die?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.560
You're gonna rot in the ground.

35:03.634 --> 35:08.003
And people are gonna go on living,
and they're gonna forget all about you.

35:08.873 --> 35:11.341
And when you rot,

35:11.476 --> 35:16.436
do you think it's gonna matter
whether you were an original gangster?

35:17.748 --> 35:19.181
You're dead.

35:20.585 --> 35:24.954
And nobody,
nobody is gonna wanna remember you,

35:25.056 --> 35:29.186
because all you left behind
in this world is this.

35:47.311 --> 35:49.006
You're raising your hand?

35:51.082 --> 35:54.483
That thing that you said before,
the Holocause?

35:54.585 --> 35:57.145
- Holocaust, yes.
- What is that?

36:01.459 --> 36:04.690
Raise your hand if you know
what the Holocaust is.

36:17.408 --> 36:19.239
Raise your hand

36:19.911 --> 36:23.540
if anyone in this classroom
has ever been shot at.

37:28.312 --> 37:31.110
What about this?
We were discussing the Holocaust.

37:31.215 --> 37:32.682
No, they won't be able to read that.

37:33.818 --> 37:36.286
We can try.
The books are just sitting here.

37:36.387 --> 37:38.116
Look at their reading scores.

37:38.222 --> 37:40.486
And if I give your kids these books,
I'll never see them again.

37:40.591 --> 37:42.525
If I do, they'll be damaged.

37:42.893 --> 37:46.385
<i>What about these? Romeo and Juliet.
That's a great gang story.</i>

37:46.497 --> 37:50.126
No, not the books.
This is what we give them.

37:50.635 --> 37:52.865
<i>It is Romeo and Juliet,
but it's a condensed version.</i>

37:53.004 --> 37:55.029
But even these,
look how they treat them.

37:55.172 --> 37:58.232
See how torn up they are?
They draw on them.

37:59.577 --> 38:01.306
Ms. Campbell?

38:01.479 --> 38:02.571
They know they get these

38:02.613 --> 38:04.376
because no one thinks
they're smart enough for real books.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.450
Well, I don't have the budget
to buy new books every semester

38:06.550 --> 38:07.744
when these kids don't return them.

38:07.852 --> 38:09.581
So, what do I do?
Buy their books myself?

38:09.687 --> 38:12.815
Well, that's up to you,
but you'd be wasting your money.

38:13.190 --> 38:16.057
Is there someone else
I can speak to about this?

38:16.594 --> 38:19.154
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry, but

38:20.164 --> 38:21.222
I don't understand.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.129
Does the Long Beach Board of Ed agree

38:23.267 --> 38:25.827
that these books should just sit here
and not be used at all?

38:25.970 --> 38:27.562
Let me explain.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.403
It's called site-based instruction.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.376
It means that I and the principal
each have the authority

38:34.478 --> 38:37.345
to make these kinds of decisions
without having to go to the Board,

38:37.448 --> 38:41.908
who have bigger problems to solve.
Do you understand how it works now?

38:42.553 --> 38:45.021
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to overstep your authority.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.283
I would never do that. I just...

38:48.893 --> 38:51.521
I don't know how to make them
interested in reading with these.

38:51.629 --> 38:55.190
You can't make someone
want an education.

38:55.466 --> 38:59.527
The best you can do is try to get them
to obey, to learn discipline.

38:59.670 --> 39:02.400
That would be a tremendous
accomplishment for them.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.871
Since you know Margaret
better than I do,

39:08.979 --> 39:11.539
if I could just get
some backup from you.

39:11.649 --> 39:16.518
<i>I really think that the stories like
The Diary of Anne Frank and...</i>

39:16.620 --> 39:18.349
That they'd be so great for them,

39:18.456 --> 39:21.914
and she doesn't seem to understand
that they could relate to these stories

39:22.026 --> 39:23.653
considering all that they face.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.662
Oh, of course. It's a universal story.

39:26.764 --> 39:31.724
I mean, Anne Frank, Rodney King,
they're almost interchangeable.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.565
- Are you making fun of me?
- Yeah.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.869
God, listen to what you're saying.

39:39.977 --> 39:42.309
How dare you compare them
to Anne Frank?

39:42.813 --> 39:43.939
They don't hide.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.539
They drive around in the open
with automatic weapons.

39:46.650 --> 39:50.108
I'm the one living in fear.
I can't walk out my door at night.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.621
And you blame these kids?

39:52.723 --> 39:55.817
This was an A-list school
before they came here.

39:55.926 --> 39:57.826
And look what they turned it into.

39:58.763 --> 40:01.129
I mean, does it make sense

40:02.099 --> 40:04.192
that kids who want
an education should suffer

40:04.268 --> 40:07.237
because their high school gets turned
into a reform school?

40:07.338 --> 40:09.829
Because kids who don't want to be here,
and shouldn't be here,

40:09.974 --> 40:11.236
are forced to be here

40:11.342 --> 40:13.310
by the geniuses
running the school district?

40:15.012 --> 40:16.775
Integration's a lie.

40:16.881 --> 40:20.578
Yeah, we teachers, we can't say that
or we lose our jobs for being racist.

40:20.684 --> 40:23.778
So, please, stop your cheerleading,
Erin. You're ridiculous.

40:23.888 --> 40:26.448
You don't know the first thing
about these kids.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.582
And you're not qualified
to make judgments about the teachers

40:28.692 --> 40:30.785
who have to survive this place.

41:11.001 --> 41:14.732
We're gonna play a game, all right?
It's a lot of fun. I promise.

41:16.373 --> 41:18.807
Look, you can either sit in your seats
reading those workbooks,

41:18.909 --> 41:19.898
or you can play a game.

41:20.044 --> 41:21.636
Either way,
you're in here till the bell rings.

41:21.745 --> 41:25.647
Okay. This is called the Line Game.

41:25.749 --> 41:27.307
I'm gonna ask you a question.

41:27.418 --> 41:30.615
If that question applies to you,
you step onto the line,

41:30.721 --> 41:33.349
and then step back away
for the next question.

41:33.457 --> 41:35.152
- Easy, right?
- Yeah, whatever.

41:35.593 --> 41:36.924
The first question,

41:37.161 --> 41:40.426
how many of you have
the new Snoop Dogg album?

41:48.472 --> 41:49.564
Did you steal it?

41:50.374 --> 41:51.841
Okay, back away.

41:55.045 --> 41:56.137
Next question,

41:56.247 --> 41:59.739
<i>how many of you have seen
Boyz n the Hood?</i>

42:08.425 --> 42:10.393
Okay. Next question.

42:10.494 --> 42:13.395
How many of you live in the projects?

42:18.202 --> 42:23.162
How many of you know someone,
a friend or relative,

42:23.307 --> 42:26.276
who was or is in juvenile hall or jail?

42:30.214 --> 42:32.375
How many of you have been
in juvenile hall

42:32.483 --> 42:34.747
or jail for any length of time?

42:35.185 --> 42:36.152
Detention don't count.

42:40.024 --> 42:41.719
Does a refugee camp count?

42:42.860 --> 42:44.225
You decide.

42:59.276 --> 43:02.006
How many of you know
where to get drugs right now?

43:07.284 --> 43:10.151
How many of you
know someone in a gang?

43:18.462 --> 43:21.158
How many of you are gang members?

43:22.366 --> 43:24.061
- Nice try.
- Nice try.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.234
Okay, that was a stupid question,
wasn't it?

43:28.339 --> 43:29.306
Yeah.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.408
You're not allowed
gang affiliations in school.

43:31.508 --> 43:33.908
I apologize for asking. My badness.

43:38.682 --> 43:42.448
Okay, now I'm gonna ask you
a more serious question.

43:43.354 --> 43:48.155
Stand on the line if you've lost
a friend to gang violence.

44:13.684 --> 44:16.619
Stay on the line if you've lost
more than one friend.

44:23.460 --> 44:24.654
Three.

44:38.475 --> 44:40.272
Four or more.

44:50.988 --> 44:53.115
Okay, I'd like us to pay respect
to those people now.

44:53.223 --> 44:55.748
Wherever you are,
just speak their name.

45:04.802 --> 45:05.769
James.

45:10.574 --> 45:11.541
Beatriz.

45:22.619 --> 45:24.416
Thank you all very much.

45:25.756 --> 45:28.384
Now, I have something for each of you.

45:31.195 --> 45:33.356
Everyone has their own story,

45:33.464 --> 45:37.992
and it's important for you
to tell your own story, even to yourself.

45:38.135 --> 45:40.695
So, what we're going to do is

45:40.838 --> 45:43.807
we're gonna write every day
in these journals.

45:44.141 --> 45:48.703
You can write about whatever you want,
the past, the present, the future.

45:48.812 --> 45:52.714
You can write it like a diary,
or you can write

45:52.816 --> 45:58.220
songs, poems, any good thing,
bad thing, anything.

45:58.322 --> 46:01.018
But you have to write every day.

46:01.191 --> 46:04.683
Keep a pen nearby.
Whenever you feel the inspiration.

46:04.728 --> 46:06.787
And they won't be graded.

46:06.897 --> 46:10.560
How can I give an A or a B
for writing the truth, right?

46:10.667 --> 46:13.431
And I will not read them
unless you give me permission.

46:13.570 --> 46:17.301
I will need to see that you've made
an entry, but I'll just do this,

46:17.407 --> 46:18.931
skim to see that you wrote that day.

46:19.076 --> 46:24.343
Now, if you want me to read it, I have...
Excuse me. A cabinet over here.

46:24.448 --> 46:28.111
It has a lock on it.
I will keep it open during class,

46:28.218 --> 46:31.051
and you can leave your diary there
if you want me to read it.

46:31.155 --> 46:34.784
I will lock this cabinet
at the end of every class.

46:36.026 --> 46:37.118
Okay?

46:39.129 --> 46:44.999
So, you can each come up,
one by one, and take your own journal.

46:52.442 --> 46:54.307
Whenever you're ready.

47:18.969 --> 47:21.437
Eva holds back,
but I know she wants to be involved.

47:21.538 --> 47:23.005
She's so stubborn.

47:23.140 --> 47:25.472
Who really surprised me was Brandy,
who never says a word,

47:25.576 --> 47:28.306
but she was the first to step up
and take a journal. I...

47:28.412 --> 47:30.243
Honey, here. Here, sit down.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.871
- It's all right. No, it's all right.
- I'll move this.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.212
I don't mind standing.
Food goes straight down.

47:34.318 --> 47:37.253
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- I don't know.

47:37.354 --> 47:39.822
- Want to help?
- Not really, I'm a terrible drawer.

47:39.923 --> 47:43.791
- You're an architect.
- All right, I just don't want to.

47:45.229 --> 47:46.753
What's the matter?
Is something wrong?

47:46.864 --> 47:48.491
No, it's nothing.

47:49.566 --> 47:53.093
Well, it's just, you know,
I want to hear all this, I do.

47:53.604 --> 47:54.662
It just...

47:54.805 --> 47:56.534
I feel like
we haven't talked about anything,

47:56.640 --> 47:59.700
other than your job, in like forever.

47:59.843 --> 48:01.071
I'm sorry.

48:01.912 --> 48:03.607
- Well, what's going on at work?
- Nothing.

48:03.647 --> 48:05.274
I don't want to talk about that, either.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.180
I just want to hang out.
I want to be home.

48:10.621 --> 48:13.112
And I want to be with my schoolteacher.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.893
I've always had this fantasy
about being kept late after school.

48:23.000 --> 48:27.664
Well, I'm sorry I left
my dirty erasers at work.

48:27.804 --> 48:30.170
Do all the other teachers
put in this much extra effort?

48:30.274 --> 48:33.072
I don't know.
I'm kind of making it up as I go along.

48:33.176 --> 48:35.838
And the other teachers don't really
talk to me. I mean, Brian and Margaret...

48:35.946 --> 48:37.880
- Honey, I don't want to think.
- I'm sorry. Okay, don't think.

48:37.981 --> 48:40.108
- I just wanna...
- I'm almost done, okay?

48:42.085 --> 48:43.882
So, how much longer?

48:45.155 --> 48:47.453
Not long. Promise.

48:51.528 --> 48:54.656
Thank you so much for coming.
Susan's a terrific student. Thank you.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.392
- Great to see you.
- Good night. Take care.

48:56.500 --> 48:58.434
- Jim, thank you so much.
- Thanks, Brian.

48:58.568 --> 49:00.661
I appreciate you guys coming
to Parents' Night.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.236
Drive safe.

49:43.113 --> 49:45.604
<i>In every war, there is an enemy.</i>

49:52.756 --> 49:55.725
<i>I watched my mother
being half beaten to death</i>

49:56.093 --> 49:59.290
<i>and watched as blood and tears
streamed down her face.</i>

50:00.464 --> 50:02.365
<i>I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.</i>

50:02.400 --> 50:04.267
<i>I felt useless and scared
and furious at the same time.</i>

50:05.235 --> 50:06.964
Stay there, Brandy. Watch the kids!

50:07.104 --> 50:08.469
- Get my money!
- Watch the kids!

50:09.940 --> 50:13.671
<i>I can still feel the sting of the belt
on my back and my legs.</i>

50:14.277 --> 50:17.007
<i>One time, he couldn't pay the rent.</i>

50:17.114 --> 50:20.550
<i>And that night he stopped us on
the street and pointed to the concrete.</i>

50:20.650 --> 50:22.777
<i>He said, "Pick a spot. "</i>

50:34.564 --> 50:38.227
<i>Clive was my boy.
He had my back plenty of times.</i>

50:38.368 --> 50:42.065
<i>We was like one fist, me and him,
one army.</i>

50:42.873 --> 50:44.670
- That's heavy.
- Yeah.

50:46.410 --> 50:50.369
That's the real shit right here.
Nobody'll jump us now.

50:50.814 --> 50:53.544
But we got to practice
'cause this, this got power.

50:53.650 --> 50:55.379
You shoot it, it...

51:01.725 --> 51:04.091
<i>I sat there till the police came.</i>

51:05.262 --> 51:10.131
<i>But when they come, all they see
is a dead body, a gun and a nigga.</i>

51:10.634 --> 51:14.570
<i>They took me to juvenile hall.
First night was the scariest.</i>

51:17.274 --> 51:19.071
<i>Inmates banging on the walls,</i>

51:19.176 --> 51:23.306
<i>throwing up their gang signs, yelling out
who they were, where they're from.</i>

51:23.713 --> 51:27.740
<i>I cried my first night.
Can't never let nobody know that.</i>

51:28.652 --> 51:31.177
<i>I spent the next few years
in and out of cells.</i>

51:31.288 --> 51:34.086
<i>Every day I'd worry,
"When will I be free?"</i>

51:37.694 --> 51:40.561
My brother taught me
what the life is for a young black man.

51:40.664 --> 51:44.100
Do what you have to,
pimp, deal, whatever.

51:44.234 --> 51:46.634
Learn what colors to learn,
gang boundaries.

51:46.736 --> 51:48.931
You can stay on one corner,
you can't stay on another.

51:49.072 --> 51:51.768
<i>Learn to be quiet.
A wrong word can get you popped.</i>

51:51.875 --> 51:54.969
If you look in my eyes,
you'll see a loving girl.

51:55.078 --> 51:57.945
If you look at my smile,
you'll see nothing wrong.

51:58.582 --> 52:01.813
<i>If you pull up my shirt,
you'll see the bruises.</i>

52:01.985 --> 52:04.112
<i>What did I do to make him so mad?</i>

52:04.154 --> 52:08.056
<i>At 16, I've seen more dead bodies
than a mortician.</i>

52:08.725 --> 52:12.422
<i>Every time I step out my door,
I'm faced with the risk of being shot.</i>

52:13.096 --> 52:17.226
<i>To the outside world, it's just another
dead body on the street corner.</i>

52:17.801 --> 52:19.769
<i>They don't know that he was my friend.</i>

52:19.870 --> 52:21.201
<i>During the war in Cambodia,</i>

52:21.304 --> 52:23.295
<i>the camp stripped away
my father's dignity.</i>

52:23.440 --> 52:25.908
<i>He sometimes tries
to hurt my mom and me.</i>

52:26.042 --> 52:28.203
I feel like I have to protect my family.

52:28.311 --> 52:33.305
I was having trouble deciding what
candy I wanted, then I heard gunshots.

52:33.416 --> 52:35.247
I looked down to see
that one of my friends

52:35.352 --> 52:38.378
had blood coming out of
his back and his mouth.

52:39.122 --> 52:42.285
The next day, I pulled up my shirt
and got strapped with a gun

52:42.392 --> 52:44.656
I found in an alley by my house.

52:44.761 --> 52:47.059
<i>I don't even know how this war started.</i>

52:47.164 --> 52:50.190
<i>It's just two sides
who tripped each other way back.</i>

52:50.300 --> 52:52.791
<i>Who cares about the history behind it?</i>

52:53.603 --> 52:55.036
<i>I am my father's daughter.</i>

52:55.138 --> 52:59.507
<i>And when they call me to testify,
I will protect my own no matter what.</i>

52:59.809 --> 53:03.370
<i>Nobody cares what I do.
Why should I bother coming to school?</i>

53:03.847 --> 53:07.476
<i>My friends are soldiers, not of war,
but of the streets.</i>

53:07.584 --> 53:09.415
<i>They fight for their lives.</i>

53:09.519 --> 53:11.953
<i>I hate the cold feeling of a gun
against my skin.</i>

53:12.055 --> 53:13.352
<i>It makes me shiver.</i>

53:13.456 --> 53:17.187
<i>It's a crazy-ass life.
Once you're in, there's no getting out.</i>

53:17.294 --> 53:18.886
<i>Every time I jump somebody in</i>

53:18.995 --> 53:22.192
<i>and make someone a part of our gang,
it's another baptism.</i>

53:22.299 --> 53:24.733
<i>They give us their life,
we give them a new one.</i>

53:24.868 --> 53:28.167
I've lost many friends
who have died in an undeclared war.

53:29.439 --> 53:31.907
To the soldiers and me, it's all worth it.

53:32.442 --> 53:36.105
Risk your life dodging bullets,
pulling triggers.

53:37.514 --> 53:39.141
It's all worth it.

53:56.466 --> 53:57.455
Rum and Coke.

53:57.567 --> 53:58.829
Oh, man.

54:00.103 --> 54:01.195
This is...

54:01.338 --> 54:04.705
Mr. Gruwell? Your table is ready.
Follow me.

54:05.475 --> 54:07.033
- Dad, I got them.
- Okay.

54:08.645 --> 54:11.079
Dad, I don't know what to do with this.

54:11.181 --> 54:13.615
I'm not a social worker.
I'm barely a teacher.

54:13.717 --> 54:14.684
Thank you.

54:14.784 --> 54:17.981
These kids, they're 14, 15 years old,

54:18.088 --> 54:20.784
and if they make it through the day
alive, that's good enough.

54:20.890 --> 54:22.858
And I'm supposed to teach them?

54:25.762 --> 54:27.252
Listen to me.

54:27.364 --> 54:31.357
You're not responsible
for their lives outside that classroom.

54:32.636 --> 54:35.605
- Just do your job the best you can.
- How?

54:35.705 --> 54:37.969
The administration
doesn't give me any resources,

54:38.074 --> 54:39.905
no books, no support.

54:41.711 --> 54:43.338
So, what should I do?

54:46.683 --> 54:49.277
Fulfill your obligation
till the end of the school year,

54:49.386 --> 54:51.752
but line up another position.

54:52.155 --> 54:55.556
Success follows experience.

54:55.659 --> 54:57.957
So, get some more experience.

54:59.796 --> 55:03.926
But no matter what,
you gotta remember, it's just a job.

55:04.768 --> 55:08.704
If you're not right for this one,
get another job.

55:11.007 --> 55:13.032
You're gonna sell bras
at a department store?

55:13.176 --> 55:14.370
Just part-time.

55:14.477 --> 55:17.002
I'm having a little trouble
getting books and things for the kids.

55:17.113 --> 55:19.240
So, a little extra money
will give me a little more freedom

55:19.349 --> 55:20.577
to do what I want.

55:20.684 --> 55:23.084
And this way you can play tennis
with Evan after work.

55:23.186 --> 55:25.211
Okay, let me get my head around this.

55:25.322 --> 55:28.553
You're going to get an extra job
to pay for your job.

55:28.958 --> 55:31.392
It's just temporary. I promise.

55:31.494 --> 55:33.985
Once the kids' grades go up,
I'll get a little more help from the school.

55:34.097 --> 55:37.294
And I get an employee's discount.
Isn't that great?

55:37.434 --> 55:40.528
- Want a new TV?
- Yeah.

55:54.484 --> 55:56.975
Excuse me, if I wanted to order
any books in bulk,

55:57.087 --> 55:59.248
could I get some sort of a discount?

56:03.460 --> 56:05.485
- These books are brand new.
- I know.

56:06.796 --> 56:09.560
Okay, guys, gals. Listen up.

56:09.966 --> 56:12.059
The only problem with this book is

56:12.202 --> 56:13.897
it's about a gang member
and there's violence in it,

56:14.037 --> 56:16.198
so you may not be able to read it
as part of the curriculum.

56:16.339 --> 56:20.139
So, I'm going to try my best
to get permission, all right?

56:22.579 --> 56:24.740
It's been a little difficult
getting their attention.

56:24.848 --> 56:28.579
Up until recently, the only thing they
hated more than each other was me.

56:28.852 --> 56:32.117
Well, you united them and that's a step.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.315
What can I do for you?

56:36.025 --> 56:40.928
I want to do more with them, and I need
the support of someone in power.

56:41.030 --> 56:43.863
You have to take this up with your
department head and your principal.

56:44.483 --> 56:46.443
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

56:46.523 --> 56:48.723
My principal only listens
to my department head,

56:48.883 --> 56:50.843
And she's not very supportive.

56:50.923 --> 56:52.683
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

56:52.763 --> 56:55.563
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

56:55.683 --> 56:57.803
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

56:57.923 --> 57:00.723
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

57:00.923 --> 57:04.003
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

57:05.043 --> 57:08.003
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

57:08.083 --> 57:11.003
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

57:11.083 --> 57:13.883
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

57:14.003 --> 57:15.803
I enforced that program.

57:15.883 --> 57:17.003
With all due respect,

57:17.083 --> 57:19.443
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

57:19.603 --> 57:21.003
Until they're old enough to disappear.

57:21.083 --> 57:22.723
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

57:22.883 --> 57:25.443
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

57:25.563 --> 57:29.083
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

57:29.203 --> 57:31.923
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

57:32.003 --> 57:34.723
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

57:34.843 --> 57:38.963
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

57:39.323 --> 57:40.803
I'm thinking trips.

57:40.923 --> 57:43.803
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

57:43.883 --> 57:46.363
They haven't been given the opportunity

57:46.483 --> 57:49.003
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

57:49.083 --> 57:50.483
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

57:50.603 --> 57:52.723
And it's purely a reward system.

57:52.883 --> 57:54.643
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

57:54.803 --> 57:56.883
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

57:57.043 --> 57:58.323
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

57:58.443 --> 57:59.483
Because of budget restrictions,

57:59.643 --> 58:00.763
She's not gonna approve school trips.

58:00.923 --> 58:02.323
I'll raise the money.

58:02.443 --> 58:05.083
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

58:05.483 --> 58:07.563
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

58:07.683 --> 58:10.123
It only proves what they already believe.

58:12.043 --> 58:15.883
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

58:19.403 --> 58:21.163
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

58:21.283 --> 58:22.403
It's just weekends.

58:22.523 --> 58:24.443
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

58:24.603 --> 58:26.483
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

58:26.603 --> 58:27.603
You want me to play golf?

58:27.763 --> 58:30.043
And the bonus is I get employee rates

58:30.123 --> 58:32.403
On Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

58:32.523 --> 58:33.483
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

58:33.643 --> 58:37.083
But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

58:37.203 --> 58:39.683
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

58:39.803 --> 58:42.163
It is. I just don't know for how long.

58:42.883 --> 58:44.803
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

58:47.443 --> 58:49.483
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

58:49.603 --> 58:52.003
You can do anything!
We know that already.

58:52.083 --> 58:55.123
It's just that I... You...

58:55.803 --> 58:57.563
You didn't even ask me.

58:58.683 --> 59:02.083
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

59:02.883 --> 59:04.563
I don't understand, Erin.

59:05.683 --> 59:08.243
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

59:08.323 --> 59:11.643
When we're young,
before we have a family.

59:11.883 --> 59:14.083
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

59:14.163 --> 59:16.323
Get your architect's degree.

59:16.403 --> 59:18.323
Wouldn't that be great?

59:21.403 --> 59:22.843
What?

59:24.523 --> 59:25.803
Nothing.

59:32.603 --> 59:34.483
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

59:34.603 --> 59:36.683
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

59:36.843 --> 59:37.843
So, it should be no problem.

59:37.963 --> 59:39.043
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

59:39.053 --> 59:39.693
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

59:39.703 --> 59:40.383
My principal only listens
to my department head,

59:40.393 --> 59:40.893
And she's not very supportive.

59:40.903 --> 59:41.523
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

59:41.533 --> 59:42.293
No, I'd rather just deal directly

- No. I won't.

59:44.293 --> 59:44.893
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

What's the point

59:45.623 --> 59:46.503

have a 5th grade reading level?

59:46.513 --> 59:46.953

But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:08.963
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

01:00:08.973 --> 01:00:09.553
It is. I just don't know for how long.

01:00:09.563 --> 01:00:10.083
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

01:00:10.093 --> 01:00:10.893
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

01:00:10.903 --> 01:00:11.523
You can do anything!
We know that already.

01:00:11.533 --> 01:00:11.993
It's just that I... You...

01:00:12.003 --> 01:00:12.433
You didn't even ask me.

01:00:12.443 --> 01:00:13.303
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

01:00:13.313 --> 01:00:13.763
I don't understand, Erin.

01:00:13.773 --> 01:00:14.463
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

01:00:14.473 --> 01:00:15.093
When we're young,
before we have a family.

01:00:15.103 --> 01:00:15.903
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:16.393
Get your architect's degree.

01:00:16.403 --> 01:00:16.833
Wouldn't that be great?

01:00:16.843 --> 01:00:17.093
What?

01:00:17.103 --> 01:00:17.383
Nothing.

01:00:17.393 --> 01:00:17.993
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

01:00:18.003 --> 01:00:18.693
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

01:00:18.703 --> 01:00:19.183
So, it should be no problem.

01:00:19.193 --> 01:00:19.773
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:20.493
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

01:00:20.503 --> 01:00:20.843
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:00:20.853 --> 01:00:21.733
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:22.433
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

01:00:22.443 --> 01:00:23.343
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:23.793
I know how busy you are,

01:00:23.803 --> 01:00:24.643
And since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

01:00:24.653 --> 01:00:25.043
I'll be right back.

01:00:25.053 --> 01:00:25.503
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

01:00:25.513 --> 01:00:27.084
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

01:00:27.186 --> 01:00:30.212
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

01:00:32.357 --> 01:00:34.848
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:35.927
Andre.

01:00:39.865 --> 01:00:44.029
<i>Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.</i>

01:00:44.536 --> 01:00:46.333
<i>And with my brother in jail,</i>

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:49.407
<i>she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.</i>

01:00:49.741 --> 01:00:51.368
<i>She doesn't see me.</i>

01:00:51.977 --> 01:00:54.002
<i>She doesn't see me at all.</i>

01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:00.107
I'm going out.

01:01:05.557 --> 01:01:06.581
- What up?
- Hey.

01:01:06.692 --> 01:01:08.592
Where you going? I need you.

01:01:09.061 --> 01:01:11.996
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

01:01:12.131 --> 01:01:13.723
Tonight. I'll do it tonight.

01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:16.960
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:19.200
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

01:01:19.304 --> 01:01:21.363
I can't be waiting all day on you.

01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.099
Hey.

01:01:24.576 --> 01:01:27.977
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.714
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

01:01:30.816 --> 01:01:32.943
To who? Your brother?

01:01:33.652 --> 01:01:36.052
Hey. You Andre?

01:01:47.533 --> 01:01:49.000
- What up?
- Hey.

01:01:54.873 --> 01:01:57.273
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

01:02:00.646 --> 01:02:02.443
You, too, young lady.

01:02:05.918 --> 01:02:08.478
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

01:02:08.687 --> 01:02:12.316
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

01:02:18.597 --> 01:02:20.064
Paris.

01:02:24.469 --> 01:02:25.436
It's good.

01:02:25.771 --> 01:02:27.432
I brought you something.

01:02:31.543 --> 01:02:34.171
It's a good book. I read it in school.

01:02:34.279 --> 01:02:38.079
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:49.124
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:49.011
<i>At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.</i>

01:03:49.187 --> 01:03:52.350
<i>You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.</i>

01:03:52.457 --> 01:03:56.257
<i>And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.</i>

01:03:57.129 --> 01:03:59.393
<i>I got a little girl from Italy.</i>

01:04:13.712 --> 01:04:15.839
Tito, your hat.

01:04:45.811 --> 01:04:49.440
<i>Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.</i>

01:04:49.548 --> 01:04:51.880
<i>Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.</i>

01:04:51.983 --> 01:04:54.747
<i>More than 7,000
Jewish stores destroyed.</i>

01:04:54.853 --> 01:04:56.946
<i>Over 100 Jews killed.</i>

01:05:09.735 --> 01:05:15.139
<i>A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.</i>

01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:18.742
<i>Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau</i>

01:05:18.844 --> 01:05:22.211
<i>was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,</i>

01:05:22.314 --> 01:05:26.216
<i>who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.</i>

01:05:32.057 --> 01:05:36.687
<i>My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.</i>

01:05:37.195 --> 01:05:39.356
<i>I don't know why
it bothered me so much.</i>

01:05:39.498 --> 01:05:41.625
<i>I've seen death all my life.</i>

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:46.564
<i>But this little boy was only five.</i>

01:06:07.459 --> 01:06:10.986
<i>Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.</i>

01:06:11.696 --> 01:06:15.655
<i>She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.</i>

01:06:16.835 --> 01:06:18.632
<i>There was Elisabeth Mann.</i>

01:06:18.737 --> 01:06:23.275
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

01:06:23.575 --> 01:06:25.042
<i>Gloria Ungar.</i>

01:06:25.143 --> 01:06:27.737
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

01:06:27.846 --> 01:06:29.837
These were the lucky people.

01:06:29.948 --> 01:06:32.382
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

01:06:32.484 --> 01:06:36.284
When they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:40.017
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

01:06:40.125 --> 01:06:42.389
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

01:06:42.494 --> 01:06:44.928
I was at that time
11-and-a-half years old.

01:06:45.030 --> 01:06:46.054
<i>Eddie llam.</i>

01:06:46.198 --> 01:06:48.166
And where to go, I didn't know,

01:06:48.266 --> 01:06:51.997
But I remember one place
where I used to live.

01:06:52.103 --> 01:06:54.469
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

01:06:54.573 --> 01:06:57.770
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

01:06:57.876 --> 01:06:59.343
<i>And Renee Firestone.</i>

01:06:59.444 --> 01:07:03.346
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

01:07:03.782 --> 01:07:07.081
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

01:07:07.118 --> 01:07:09.848
Stayed with me for a little while.

01:07:10.322 --> 01:07:13.519
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:16.253
<i>She lost her whole family at the camps.</i>

01:07:17.095 --> 01:07:21.191
<i>She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.</i>

01:07:22.267 --> 01:07:24.428
<i>I'll never forget these people.</i>

01:07:24.569 --> 01:07:27.367
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

01:07:27.472 --> 01:07:30.373
<i>I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.</i>

01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.508
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

01:07:39.618 --> 01:07:42.212
<i>Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.</i>

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:43.947
<i>We haven't even ordered dessert yet,</i>

01:07:44.055 --> 01:07:46.421
<i>and the kids are having
such an incredible time.</i>

01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:48.288
<i>You have to see them.</i>

01:07:48.393 --> 01:07:51.453
<i>If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.</i>

01:07:52.864 --> 01:07:57.301
<i>Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.</i>

01:08:28.832 --> 01:08:30.767
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

01:08:30.868 --> 01:08:32.996
Get your butt in here!

01:09:05.303 --> 01:09:07.770
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:15.676
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

01:09:16.381 --> 01:09:21.785
To begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

01:09:23.354 --> 01:09:24.652
Victoria?

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:27.448
<i>Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,</i>

01:09:27.559 --> 01:09:30.118
<i>"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?</i>

01:09:30.362 --> 01:09:33.524
<i>How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?</i>

01:09:33.665 --> 01:09:37.100
<i>That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.</i>

01:09:37.202 --> 01:09:39.261
<i>Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone</i>

01:09:39.404 --> 01:09:40.837
<i>for African-Americans.</i>

01:09:40.939 --> 01:09:42.702
<i>What? Black people learn how to read,</i>

01:09:42.807 --> 01:09:45.502
<i>and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?</i>

01:09:45.609 --> 01:09:49.205
<i>At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.</i>

01:09:49.314 --> 01:09:50.781
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

01:09:50.881 --> 01:09:52.941
- How was your summer?
- Great.

01:09:57.455 --> 01:09:59.423
You're still white, I see.

01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:01.923
Okay, everybody. Ready?

01:10:02.093 --> 01:10:03.219
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

01:10:03.328 --> 01:10:04.659
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

01:10:14.105 --> 01:10:17.597
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

01:10:17.842 --> 01:10:21.938
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

01:10:22.047 --> 01:10:24.948
Which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:26.278
All right!

01:10:27.018 --> 01:10:29.316
They're very special books,

01:10:29.421 --> 01:10:33.881
And they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

01:10:37.796 --> 01:10:41.061
But, before you take the books,

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.500
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

01:10:45.603 --> 01:10:49.403
And I want each of you to make a toast.

01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:54.201
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

01:10:54.646 --> 01:10:59.208
And what that means is,
from this moment on

01:10:59.784 --> 01:11:05.120
Every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

01:11:06.257 --> 01:11:11.524
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:16.532
And the person you were
before this moment,

01:11:16.567 --> 01:11:20.001
That person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

01:11:20.939 --> 01:11:22.236
Okay?

01:11:23.341 --> 01:11:27.300
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:31.908
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

01:11:32.016 --> 01:11:33.574
What's the dealio?

01:11:41.826 --> 01:11:44.852
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

01:11:45.563 --> 01:11:48.327
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

01:11:48.733 --> 01:11:51.861
Okay, well, I was always the person

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:55.439
That was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

01:11:56.341 --> 01:11:57.706
Like my mom.

01:12:01.679 --> 01:12:03.112
Ain't gonna happen.

01:12:03.348 --> 01:12:05.543
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

01:12:06.284 --> 01:12:09.913
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

01:12:10.021 --> 01:12:13.047
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

01:12:13.825 --> 01:12:15.656
And one day, my war will end.

01:12:16.127 --> 01:12:17.890
And I will not die.

01:12:19.364 --> 01:12:22.800
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

01:12:26.337 --> 01:12:27.668
I am strong.

01:12:27.772 --> 01:12:31.003
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

01:12:32.177 --> 01:12:34.475
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:37.877
I'd like to be 18.

01:12:42.187 --> 01:12:45.714
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

01:12:45.824 --> 01:12:47.291
That'd be great.

01:12:51.262 --> 01:12:52.923
Who is he?

01:12:53.064 --> 01:12:55.157
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:58.201
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

01:12:59.771 --> 01:13:04.231
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

01:13:04.943 --> 01:13:07.138
"It all started with a phone call.

01:13:07.579 --> 01:13:10.013
"My mother was crying and begging,

01:13:10.114 --> 01:13:15.074
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:19.147
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

01:13:19.257 --> 01:13:24.695
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

01:13:25.096 --> 01:13:29.055
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

01:13:29.167 --> 01:13:32.967
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas. '

01:13:33.071 --> 01:13:36.939
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

01:13:37.041 --> 01:13:39.669
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

01:13:40.578 --> 01:13:44.105
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:49.511
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

01:13:50.088 --> 01:13:53.751
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

01:13:54.392 --> 01:13:58.260
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

01:13:58.363 --> 01:14:03.130
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

01:14:03.868 --> 01:14:06.200
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

01:14:06.237 --> 01:14:08.705
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

01:14:08.806 --> 01:14:11.138
"who were in my English class last year.

01:14:11.242 --> 01:14:14.143
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

01:14:14.245 --> 01:14:16.509
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

01:14:16.614 --> 01:14:19.276
"is the only person
that made me think of hope.

01:14:20.351 --> 01:14:23.809
"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

01:14:23.922 --> 01:14:25.947
"I began to feel better.

01:14:26.557 --> 01:14:31.517
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:34.964
"I walk into the room and feel as though

01:14:34.999 --> 01:14:38.628
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:40.737
"I am home. "

01:14:42.740 --> 01:14:44.207
Yes, you are.

01:15:04.829 --> 01:15:06.660
But you're an honors student.

01:15:06.731 --> 01:15:08.323
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

01:15:08.466 --> 01:15:10.491
Think how that will reflect
on your records.

01:15:10.635 --> 01:15:13.832
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

01:15:14.138 --> 01:15:16.003
Look, Ms. Campbell.

01:15:16.107 --> 01:15:19.702
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

01:15:20.044 --> 01:15:23.502
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

01:15:23.614 --> 01:15:26.549
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:29.586
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

01:15:29.687 --> 01:15:33.316
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

01:15:33.424 --> 01:15:37.292
"in A. P. And honors courses. "
As if I didn't notice.

01:15:37.395 --> 01:15:39.795
And when I asked
another honors teacher

01:15:39.931 --> 01:15:42.559
Why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

01:15:42.834 --> 01:15:44.802
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

01:15:44.936 --> 01:15:47.097
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.870
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

01:15:58.082 --> 01:16:00.016
Erin can't do that!

01:16:00.284 --> 01:16:02.684
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

01:16:03.287 --> 01:16:05.778
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

01:16:05.823 --> 01:16:07.415
The student requested it.

01:16:07.525 --> 01:16:10.119
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

01:16:11.396 --> 01:16:16.333
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

01:16:16.567 --> 01:16:21.606
And in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

01:16:21.641 --> 01:16:23.972
I just don't see what that teaches them.

01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:27.109
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

01:16:27.478 --> 01:16:29.571
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:31.545
What question do you want me
to answer first?

01:16:31.649 --> 01:16:34.550
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

01:16:34.652 --> 01:16:37.917
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

01:16:38.022 --> 01:16:39.922
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

01:16:40.024 --> 01:16:41.958
She actually requested my class.

01:16:42.060 --> 01:16:44.028
Can you teach an honors student?

01:16:44.395 --> 01:16:45.419
What do you mean?

01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:48.328
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

01:16:48.466 --> 01:16:50.934
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

01:16:51.569 --> 01:16:52.729
Of course I can.

01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:54.735
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

01:16:54.839 --> 01:16:58.070
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

01:16:59.644 --> 01:17:01.339
My kids' grades are up to B's.

01:17:01.512 --> 01:17:03.946
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

01:17:04.048 --> 01:17:06.846
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

01:17:06.884 --> 01:17:08.749
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

01:17:08.853 --> 01:17:10.343
<i>They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

01:17:10.455 --> 01:17:12.821
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

01:17:12.924 --> 01:17:15.222
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:17.718
Congratulations.

01:17:25.803 --> 01:17:26.861
What is wrong with you?

01:17:27.004 --> 01:17:28.995
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:31.506
That I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

01:17:31.609 --> 01:17:34.635
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

01:17:34.745 --> 01:17:35.837
Fine.

01:17:36.814 --> 01:17:38.907
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

01:17:39.016 --> 01:17:41.041
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

01:17:41.152 --> 01:17:42.744
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

01:17:42.854 --> 01:17:44.754
For two years and intern for three?

01:17:44.856 --> 01:17:46.346
I'll be over 40.

01:17:46.457 --> 01:17:48.482
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

01:17:48.593 --> 01:17:52.620
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:56.061
Why not?

01:18:05.276 --> 01:18:09.269
<i>"Writing in a diary is a really strange
experience for someone like me.</i>

01:18:09.413 --> 01:18:12.143
<i>"I mean, not only because
I've never written anything before,</i>

01:18:12.283 --> 01:18:14.581
<i>"but also because

01:18:14.685 --> 01:18:17.483

01:18:40.645 --> 01:18:44.945
<i>"Jews must wear a yellow star.

Hi.

When is Anne gonna smoke Hitler?

01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:31.119
- What?
- You know. Take him out?

<i>Eva, this is The Diary of Anne Frank,
not Die Hard.</i>

01:19:36.701 --> 01:19:38.168
Keep reading.

- Are Anne and Peter gonna hook up?

<i>"It's utterly impossible for me

01:20:28.352 --> 01:20:31.719
- Eva, what's wrong?
- Why didn't you tell me she dies?

01:20:31.989 --> 01:20:34.253
Why you didn't tell me she gets caught
in the end?

01:20:34.659 --> 01:20:36.786
I hate you and I hate this book.

01:20:36.894 --> 01:20:37.861
Eva.

01:20:37.962 --> 01:20:42.194
If she dies, then what about me?
What are you saying about that?

01:20:43.401 --> 01:20:46.029
- Anne Frank died, but she...
- I can't believe they got her!

01:20:46.137 --> 01:20:48.765
That ain't supposed to happen
in the story! That ain't right!

01:20:48.873 --> 01:20:50.602
- 'Cause it's true?
- I ain't talking to you!

01:20:50.708 --> 01:20:53.404
You're talking around me.
That's the same thing.

01:20:53.511 --> 01:20:55.342
See, to me, she ain't dead at all.

01:20:55.446 --> 01:20:58.142
How many friends did you know
that are dead now that got killed?

01:20:58.282 --> 01:20:59.613
Too many to count.

01:20:59.717 --> 01:21:02.151
How many have you read a book about?

01:21:02.420 --> 01:21:05.389
Have you seen them on TV
or even in the newspaper?

01:21:05.456 --> 01:21:07.083
That's why this story's dope.

01:21:07.191 --> 01:21:08.954
She was our age, man.

01:21:09.093 --> 01:21:12.585
Anne Frank understands our situation,
my situation.

01:21:12.697 --> 01:21:15.632
And that Miep Gies lady,
the one that helped hide them?

01:21:15.733 --> 01:21:16.961
I like her.

01:21:17.068 --> 01:21:19.502
I got all these other books
about her from the library.

01:21:19.603 --> 01:21:22.470
Wow. You used your library card?

01:21:24.408 --> 01:21:25.466
No.

01:21:27.745 --> 01:21:32.512
Okay, listen up.
Marcus has given me an idea.

01:21:33.017 --> 01:21:36.509
<i>Instead of doing a book report on
The Diary of Anne Frank,</i>

01:21:36.654 --> 01:21:40.590
For our assignment I want you
to write a letter to Miep Gies,

01:21:40.691 --> 01:21:42.955
The woman who helped shelter
the Franks.

01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:46.518
She's still alive and she lives in Europe.

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:49.394
In the letter, I want you to tell her
how you feel about the book.

01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:51.991
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

01:21:52.103 --> 01:21:54.264
But I want the letters to be perfect,

01:21:54.372 --> 01:21:56.806
So be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

01:21:56.907 --> 01:21:58.374
Is she gonna read the letters?

01:21:58.476 --> 01:22:00.876
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

01:22:01.045 --> 01:22:02.603
We should get her to read them.

01:22:02.747 --> 01:22:05.807
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

01:22:05.883 --> 01:22:07.248
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:09.182
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

01:22:10.955 --> 01:22:12.786
Wait. Guys.

01:22:15.993 --> 01:22:19.588
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

01:22:19.697 --> 01:22:22.165
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

01:22:22.266 --> 01:22:23.893
And it would be really expensive.

01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.696
We could raise the money.

01:22:26.637 --> 01:22:27.695
Ms. G?

01:22:27.805 --> 01:22:31.764
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

01:22:51.629 --> 01:22:52.926
Five.

01:23:06.343 --> 01:23:07.742
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

01:23:07.845 --> 01:23:10.336
For the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

01:24:25.122 --> 01:24:26.680
Come in, Margaret.

01:25:13.304 --> 01:25:16.102
<i>Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam</i>

01:25:16.206 --> 01:25:18.003
<i>to Miep Gies, herself.</i>

01:25:18.208 --> 01:25:20.403
<i>When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,</i>

01:25:20.511 --> 01:25:23.002
<i>there was no stopping her,
man, for real.</i>

01:25:30.321 --> 01:25:34.451
<i>And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.</i>

01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:40.660
<i>But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.</i>

01:25:59.316 --> 01:26:02.843
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

01:26:03.721 --> 01:26:06.986
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

01:26:07.024 --> 01:26:10.892
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

01:26:11.595 --> 01:26:17.966
And a man pointed a gun at
me and said, "Not a sound.

01:26:18.469 --> 01:26:20.096
"Not one word. "

01:26:21.238 --> 01:26:23.866
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

01:26:24.408 --> 01:26:26.842
I felt so helpless.

01:26:26.944 --> 01:26:29.504
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

01:26:29.647 --> 01:26:32.377
So, I ran back to my house.

01:26:32.516 --> 01:26:35.246
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

01:26:35.352 --> 01:26:38.116
Anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

01:26:38.255 --> 01:26:41.554
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

01:26:41.659 --> 01:26:45.959
And the soldier there took out his gun

01:26:46.597 --> 01:26:48.792
And put it against my head.

01:26:53.370 --> 01:26:57.966
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

01:26:58.676 --> 01:27:02.635
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

01:27:02.846 --> 01:27:06.543
He was Austrian, and so was I,

01:27:06.984 --> 01:27:09.748
But I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

01:27:09.853 --> 01:27:13.653
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

01:27:15.559 --> 01:27:20.087
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

01:27:21.398 --> 01:27:25.232
And I think about Anne Frank.

01:27:27.805 --> 01:27:28.897
Yes?

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.873
I've never had a hero before.

01:27:39.783 --> 01:27:41.250
But you are my hero.

01:27:41.719 --> 01:27:45.416
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

01:27:45.522 --> 01:27:48.218
I am not a hero. No.

01:27:48.325 --> 01:27:54.855
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

01:27:55.265 --> 01:27:56.664
That is all.

01:27:58.702 --> 01:28:01.535
You know, we are all ordinary people.

01:28:02.239 --> 01:28:09.077
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

01:28:10.481 --> 01:28:16.386
Can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

01:28:18.889 --> 01:28:20.686
In a dark room.

01:28:21.258 --> 01:28:22.418
<i>Ja?</i>

01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:30.191
I have read your letters,

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.067
And your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

01:28:37.207 --> 01:28:40.005
You are the heroes.

01:28:41.311 --> 01:28:44.940
You are heroes every day.

01:28:51.822 --> 01:28:55.258
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

01:29:14.945 --> 01:29:16.310
You hungry?

01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:23.515
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

01:29:24.154 --> 01:29:26.122
I know what I have to say.

01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:28.917
Yeah.

01:29:29.593 --> 01:29:31.857
- You know how that is.
- I know.

01:29:33.230 --> 01:29:35.858
And that man that put your father
in prison,

01:29:35.966 --> 01:29:38.628
He knew he was sending
an innocent man.

01:29:39.002 --> 01:29:40.299
But, you know,

01:29:42.239 --> 01:29:43.831
He was just

01:29:45.909 --> 01:29:47.638
Protecting his own.

01:29:53.851 --> 01:29:56.547
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

01:30:23.347 --> 01:30:25.315
Hey, Mama. Mama.

01:30:30.921 --> 01:30:33.321
What the hell are you doing here?

01:30:39.630 --> 01:30:43.566
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:44.964
I'm sorry.

01:30:47.471 --> 01:30:50.599
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

01:30:52.509 --> 01:30:54.136
I need you, Mama.

01:30:55.946 --> 01:30:57.413
I need you.

01:31:35.085 --> 01:31:36.848
And what time was that?

01:31:37.721 --> 01:31:40.019
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

01:31:40.691 --> 01:31:42.158
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

01:31:42.259 --> 01:31:44.124
Grant Rice, in the store?

01:31:45.329 --> 01:31:47.695
I told you he was playing
the video game.

01:31:48.298 --> 01:31:50.766
Then what happened?
What did you see?

01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:53.294
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

01:31:53.437 --> 01:31:57.032
And then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

01:31:57.140 --> 01:32:00.337
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

01:32:01.445 --> 01:32:03.879
No. The guy who ran the store.

01:32:04.014 --> 01:32:06.039
He wanted his money back
for the game.

01:32:06.083 --> 01:32:08.108
And what did the store owner do?

01:32:08.952 --> 01:32:12.251
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

01:32:12.522 --> 01:32:16.788
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

01:32:17.361 --> 01:32:19.852
And then what happened?
What did you see?

01:32:24.034 --> 01:32:25.661
I saw...

01:32:37.848 --> 01:32:39.315
I saw...

01:32:54.598 --> 01:32:56.065
Paco did it.

01:33:00.237 --> 01:33:01.966
Paco killed the guy.

01:34:27.591 --> 01:34:30.082
My father won't talk to me anymore.

01:34:32.462 --> 01:34:37.832
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

01:34:39.236 --> 01:34:41.534
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

01:34:43.006 --> 01:34:47.966
See, my aunt lives even further away,

01:34:50.046 --> 01:34:54.346
So I was just wondering if I could, like,

01:34:57.487 --> 01:34:59.271
Stay here late with you

01:34:59.306 --> 01:35:01.056
Stay here late with you

01:35:02.926 --> 01:35:07.420
So I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

01:35:09.900 --> 01:35:12.869
You can stay as late as you want.

01:35:14.237 --> 01:35:18.196
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

01:35:21.444 --> 01:35:23.275
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

01:35:59.049 --> 01:36:00.983
I think I got your color.

01:36:47.664 --> 01:36:49.655
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

01:36:49.766 --> 01:36:52.530
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

01:36:59.576 --> 01:37:03.376
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

01:37:05.115 --> 01:37:07.583
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

01:37:13.757 --> 01:37:16.021
<i>... enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.</i>

01:37:16.126 --> 01:37:20.392
<i>In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South</i>

01:37:20.497 --> 01:37:22.226
<i>to challenge segregation.</i>

01:37:22.332 --> 01:37:25.199
<i>Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.</i>

01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:29.196
<i>They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.</i>

01:37:29.806 --> 01:37:33.970
<i>In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,</i>

01:37:34.077 --> 01:37:36.443
<i>knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.</i>

01:37:36.579 --> 01:37:39.548
<i>He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.</i>

01:37:39.649 --> 01:37:43.141
<i>That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.</i>

01:37:43.286 --> 01:37:46.653
<i>I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed</i>

01:37:46.756 --> 01:37:50.522
<i>because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.</i>

01:37:50.694 --> 01:37:52.059
<i>But not anymore.</i>

01:37:52.228 --> 01:37:53.752
<i>And I must have some kind of courage,</i>

01:37:53.863 --> 01:37:57.594
<i>because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.</i>

01:37:58.668 --> 01:37:59.965
<i>I stayed.</i>

01:38:00.403 --> 01:38:01.700
Hi, I'm home!

01:38:02.305 --> 01:38:07.242
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

01:38:07.777 --> 01:38:10.143
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

01:38:11.514 --> 01:38:13.175
I'm so tired.

01:38:13.683 --> 01:38:16.550
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.451
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:38:40.076 --> 01:38:43.170
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

01:38:43.947 --> 01:38:48.350
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

01:38:50.353 --> 01:38:52.116
Why are you doing this?

01:38:52.222 --> 01:38:55.487
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

01:38:55.592 --> 01:38:57.560
No. That's not it.

01:38:59.929 --> 01:39:03.990
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

01:39:06.336 --> 01:39:07.963
Erin, it's just...

01:39:09.205 --> 01:39:10.695
It's too hard.

01:39:11.307 --> 01:39:13.468
Your life is too hard?

01:39:13.977 --> 01:39:16.502
I think what you're doing is noble.

01:39:17.113 --> 01:39:20.674
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

01:39:21.284 --> 01:39:22.581
I am.

01:39:24.921 --> 01:39:28.220
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

01:39:28.324 --> 01:39:31.487
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

01:39:31.594 --> 01:39:34.392
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

01:39:34.497 --> 01:39:36.522
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

01:39:36.633 --> 01:39:37.622
They're not even your kids!

01:39:37.734 --> 01:39:41.534
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

01:39:45.675 --> 01:39:50.578
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

01:39:50.713 --> 01:39:55.377
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

01:39:56.019 --> 01:39:58.852
Everything about my life
makes sense to me.

01:40:02.392 --> 01:40:04.758
How often does a person get that?

01:40:08.064 --> 01:40:12.160
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

01:40:12.268 --> 01:40:17.171
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

01:40:17.273 --> 01:40:19.138
Because I can't be your wife.

01:40:26.449 --> 01:40:28.747
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.080
Erin?

01:40:33.690 --> 01:40:36.250
You know,
if you had to choose between us

01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:39.387
And the class,

01:40:41.197 --> 01:40:42.630
Who would you pick?

01:40:44.667 --> 01:40:48.125
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

01:40:49.105 --> 01:40:50.732
Erin, look at me.

01:40:54.244 --> 01:40:56.405
This is all there's ever been to me.

01:40:56.779 --> 01:41:01.148
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

01:41:02.986 --> 01:41:04.510
See? You don't want to be here either,

01:41:04.654 --> 01:41:07.987
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

01:41:09.325 --> 01:41:13.955
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

01:41:15.131 --> 01:41:17.099
You love the idea of me.

01:41:22.639 --> 01:41:24.937
But it's such a great idea.

01:41:28.611 --> 01:41:29.908
I know.

01:41:57.974 --> 01:41:59.771
Dad? Hi.

01:42:02.378 --> 01:42:05.575
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

01:42:05.715 --> 01:42:07.683
And I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

01:42:07.717 --> 01:42:10.277
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.719
I need to make this call. I love you.

01:42:26.769 --> 01:42:29.260
<i>Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.</i>

01:42:29.372 --> 01:42:33.009
<i>It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.</i>

01:42:33.044 --> 01:42:34.874
<i>It made me feel hopeful.</i>

01:42:35.411 --> 01:42:38.676
<i>At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.</i>

01:42:38.815 --> 01:42:41.443
<i>No O. J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney</i>

01:42:41.584 --> 01:42:43.552
<i>who probably thought
his ass was guilty.</i>

01:42:43.686 --> 01:42:47.315
<i>And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.</i>

01:42:47.657 --> 01:42:50.387
<i>My brother got 15 years to life.</i>

01:42:50.493 --> 01:42:53.223
<i>Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.</i>

01:42:53.329 --> 01:42:55.524
<i>It just means somebody
pays for the crime.</i>

01:43:01.371 --> 01:43:02.895
So, you got time now?

01:43:09.779 --> 01:43:11.371
Anyone know where Andre's been?

01:43:11.514 --> 01:43:12.776
I haven't seen him on the bus.

01:43:12.915 --> 01:43:14.382
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

01:43:23.292 --> 01:43:24.816
Ms. G?

01:43:25.194 --> 01:43:27.526
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

01:43:27.630 --> 01:43:30.758
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

01:43:32.301 --> 01:43:33.825
What do you mean?

01:43:33.936 --> 01:43:36.632
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

01:43:36.739 --> 01:43:39.867
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

01:43:42.578 --> 01:43:43.943
Well, I...

01:43:45.815 --> 01:43:49.546
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

01:43:50.053 --> 01:43:51.179
What? What are you talking about?

01:43:53.389 --> 01:43:55.016
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

01:43:55.124 --> 01:43:57.649
Of course I do. I can't.

01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.251
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

01:44:00.363 --> 01:44:02.297
It's regulations.

01:44:05.034 --> 01:44:07.832
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

01:44:07.870 --> 01:44:09.201
Who cares about seniority?

01:44:09.338 --> 01:44:11.898
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:16.808
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

01:44:16.946 --> 01:44:20.382
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

01:44:20.516 --> 01:44:23.952
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

01:44:24.087 --> 01:44:26.112
There's no place like this
out there for us.

01:44:26.389 --> 01:44:27.788
That's true.

01:44:28.291 --> 01:44:30.851
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

01:44:30.993 --> 01:44:31.960
You're not allowed?

01:44:33.996 --> 01:44:37.625
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

01:44:37.734 --> 01:44:39.497
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

01:44:39.602 --> 01:44:41.593
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

01:44:41.704 --> 01:44:43.501
We bust a few of them
board members' heads.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:45.129
Marcus.

01:44:45.241 --> 01:44:48.870
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

01:44:49.112 --> 01:44:50.579
Or we can paint
the administration building

01:44:50.713 --> 01:44:53.181
With the word "assholes"
in various colors.

01:44:54.917 --> 01:44:56.612
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

01:45:02.058 --> 01:45:03.025
What?

01:45:03.126 --> 01:45:06.687
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

01:45:06.796 --> 01:45:08.491
Honey, take a break.

01:45:12.435 --> 01:45:13.902
Sit down.

01:45:17.073 --> 01:45:19.667
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

01:45:21.144 --> 01:45:23.578
I never thought this would happen.

01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:29.643
What do I do now?

01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:33.088
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

01:45:33.489 --> 01:45:35.787
You think you should stay with them?

01:45:36.659 --> 01:45:38.957
Or is it better they move on?

01:45:39.295 --> 01:45:40.762
I don't know.

01:45:44.567 --> 01:45:47.035
It's just a job, like you said.

01:45:47.136 --> 01:45:48.763
Yeah, it is.

01:45:49.705 --> 01:45:51.673
But is the job finished?

01:45:54.010 --> 01:45:55.602
Listen to me now.

01:45:55.878 --> 01:45:58.403
What you've done with those kids...

01:46:00.817 --> 01:46:03.115
I don't even have words for it.

01:46:04.854 --> 01:46:09.814
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

01:46:11.694 --> 01:46:13.059
Special.

01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:18.233
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

01:46:20.203 --> 01:46:22.171
And I envy you that.

01:46:24.874 --> 01:46:26.501
And I admire you.

01:46:29.011 --> 01:46:33.004
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:35.117
And really mean it?

01:46:38.988 --> 01:46:42.082
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

01:46:42.191 --> 01:46:45.354
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

01:46:45.461 --> 01:46:47.452
She's only been here two years.

01:46:47.563 --> 01:46:49.656
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

01:46:49.765 --> 01:46:52.029
Who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

01:46:52.134 --> 01:46:54.034
To attain a position of seniority.

01:46:54.136 --> 01:46:58.095
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

01:46:58.207 --> 01:47:01.005
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

01:47:01.177 --> 01:47:03.941
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:05.980
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

01:47:06.082 --> 01:47:08.277
She can't. I have the juniors.

01:47:08.351 --> 01:47:10.376
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

01:47:10.519 --> 01:47:12.453
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

01:47:12.555 --> 01:47:14.853
Retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

01:47:14.957 --> 01:47:18.393
Disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

01:47:18.494 --> 01:47:20.655
And who focus on the classroom,

01:47:20.763 --> 01:47:23.596
Not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

01:47:23.699 --> 01:47:25.690
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

01:47:25.801 --> 01:47:27.291
She's in the middle of a divorce.

01:47:27.403 --> 01:47:29.894
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

01:47:30.006 --> 01:47:33.100
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

01:47:34.543 --> 01:47:36.636
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

01:47:36.779 --> 01:47:38.474
Maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

01:47:38.614 --> 01:47:41.082
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

01:47:41.951 --> 01:47:43.418
Carl, look.

01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:47.080
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

01:47:47.189 --> 01:47:48.588
Even if an arrangement were made

01:47:48.691 --> 01:47:52.821
And she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

01:47:52.929 --> 01:47:55.295
In the curriculum for her to teach.

01:47:55.932 --> 01:47:59.595
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

01:47:59.702 --> 01:48:00.760
No.

01:48:02.538 --> 01:48:04.768
Then there's nothing I can do.

01:48:08.311 --> 01:48:09.608
So that's it?

01:48:10.746 --> 01:48:12.213
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

01:48:12.315 --> 01:48:15.045
There are other capable teachers
in this school.

01:48:15.184 --> 01:48:17.175
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:18.981
Your students should be ready
to move on.

01:48:19.088 --> 01:48:21.750
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

01:48:21.857 --> 01:48:25.122
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

01:48:25.227 --> 01:48:27.058
What does that have to do
with teaching?

01:48:27.163 --> 01:48:29.757
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

01:48:30.166 --> 01:48:31.861
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

01:48:31.968 --> 01:48:34.402
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

01:48:34.503 --> 01:48:37.472
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

01:48:37.573 --> 01:48:39.234
Fighting to be a better teacher,

01:48:39.342 --> 01:48:42.709
And now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

01:48:42.812 --> 01:48:45.474
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

01:48:45.614 --> 01:48:47.673
It'll be because they weren't prepared!

01:48:47.817 --> 01:48:50.513
Lt'll be because you failed, not them!

01:49:09.105 --> 01:49:11.767
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

01:49:25.021 --> 01:49:27.489
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

01:49:27.623 --> 01:49:29.818
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

01:49:29.925 --> 01:49:31.722
I had things to do.

01:49:34.997 --> 01:49:36.794
About this.

01:49:37.266 --> 01:49:38.426
The evaluation assignment

01:49:38.534 --> 01:49:40.001
Was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

01:49:40.102 --> 01:49:42.536
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

01:49:42.938 --> 01:49:46.135
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:49.405
You know what this is?

01:49:49.712 --> 01:49:53.705
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

01:49:53.849 --> 01:49:57.114
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

01:49:57.453 --> 01:49:59.683
We're all of us up against something.

01:50:00.656 --> 01:50:04.023
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

01:50:04.126 --> 01:50:06.924
To look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

01:50:07.029 --> 01:50:08.587
I am not letting you fail,

01:50:08.631 --> 01:50:10.690
Even if that means coming
to your house every night

01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:12.495
Until you finish the work.

01:50:12.601 --> 01:50:14.398
I see who you are.

01:50:14.937 --> 01:50:17.064
Do you understand me?

01:50:18.074 --> 01:50:20.042
I can see you.

01:50:21.911 --> 01:50:23.845
And you are not failing.

01:50:27.283 --> 01:50:32.220
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

01:50:32.755 --> 01:50:34.780
I want a new evaluation.

01:50:39.995 --> 01:50:42.793
An F. What, are you tripping?

01:50:48.471 --> 01:50:51.929
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

01:50:54.710 --> 01:50:57.577
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

01:50:57.713 --> 01:50:58.805
- What?
- What?

01:51:00.449 --> 01:51:02.349
You... Wait.

01:51:03.085 --> 01:51:05.053
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

01:51:06.455 --> 01:51:08.923
No! That don't fly, Ma!

01:51:10.493 --> 01:51:14.156
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

01:51:14.263 --> 01:51:16.458
No, it doesn't mean mother.

01:51:17.166 --> 01:51:19.498
It's a sign of respect for you.

01:51:33.716 --> 01:51:35.115
Listen to me.

01:51:35.351 --> 01:51:36.648
All of you.

01:51:37.419 --> 01:51:42.049
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

01:51:43.959 --> 01:51:47.258
You made it to your junior year.

01:51:48.063 --> 01:51:50.861
Think about how you did that.

01:51:52.234 --> 01:51:55.897
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

01:51:56.939 --> 01:51:59.499
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

01:51:59.608 --> 01:52:02.372
The first with a choice to go to college.

01:52:03.379 --> 01:52:06.177
Some may move faster than others.

01:52:07.783 --> 01:52:10.081
But you'll each have the chance.

01:52:11.153 --> 01:52:14.122
And you did that. Not me.

01:52:21.197 --> 01:52:24.860
Now, I have one

01:52:26.902 --> 01:52:28.494
Final project in mind.

01:52:28.604 --> 01:52:30.799
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

01:52:32.641 --> 01:52:37.601
<i>Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.</i>

01:52:38.347 --> 01:52:40.372
<i>She got this businessman, John Tu,</i>

01:52:40.516 --> 01:52:43.349
<i>to donate 35 computers
so we could work.</i>

01:52:48.424 --> 01:52:51.825
<i>She told us we have something
to say to people.</i>

01:52:51.994 --> 01:52:53.193
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

01:52:53.228 --> 01:52:54.392
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

01:52:54.496 --> 01:52:58.193
<i>We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.</i>

01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.359
<i>And even if nobody else read it,</i>

01:53:00.469 --> 01:53:04.064
<i>the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,</i>

01:53:04.673 --> 01:53:07.767
<i>this is what happened, we mattered.</i>

01:53:08.244 --> 01:53:12.510
<i>Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.</i>

01:53:14.216 --> 01:53:16.582
<i>Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,</i>

01:53:16.685 --> 01:53:19.552
<i>but we could get it out there ourselves.</i>

01:53:20.289 --> 01:53:22.519
<i>She asked us to come up with a title,</i>

01:53:23.058 --> 01:53:25.026
<i>something to call ourselves.</i>

01:53:42.811 --> 01:53:44.676
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

01:53:44.813 --> 01:53:45.905
At the Board of Education.

01:53:46.048 --> 01:53:48.039
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

01:53:48.183 --> 01:53:51.619
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

01:53:59.428 --> 01:54:04.889
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

01:54:05.801 --> 01:54:07.393
To who? To you?

01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:09.697
To each other.

01:54:10.506 --> 01:54:13.839
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

01:54:14.376 --> 01:54:17.709
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

01:54:18.147 --> 01:54:19.273
Once they're out of her class,

01:54:19.415 --> 01:54:21.849
Believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:25.909
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

01:54:26.055 --> 01:54:29.547
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

01:54:29.658 --> 01:54:31.285
What about new students
that come in next year?

01:54:31.393 --> 01:54:33.384
Can she repeat
this process every year?

01:54:33.495 --> 01:54:34.894
Her methods are impractical,

01:54:34.997 --> 01:54:37.625
Impossible to implement with regularity.

01:54:37.733 --> 01:54:40.224
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

01:54:40.836 --> 01:54:42.064
We have millions of children

01:54:42.171 --> 01:54:43.900
To get through the education system
in this country,

01:54:44.006 --> 01:54:45.837
And we need a means
of accomplishing that

01:54:45.941 --> 01:54:48.842
Which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

01:54:48.944 --> 01:54:50.878
Not just special cases.

01:54:52.381 --> 01:54:55.839
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

01:54:55.984 --> 01:54:58.953
For every grade,
for every student you teach?

01:55:03.525 --> 01:55:04.992
I don't know.

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:12.531
Thank you.

01:55:32.921 --> 01:55:35.822
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

01:55:44.733 --> 01:55:46.132
What happened?

01:55:46.935 --> 01:55:50.735
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

01:55:56.578 --> 01:55:57.875
No.

01:55:58.814 --> 01:56:00.679
- What?
- What?

01:56:05.287 --> 01:56:08.654
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

01:56:10.092 --> 01:56:11.150
Yes!

01:56:13.870 --> 01:56:15.830
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

01:56:15.910 --> 01:56:18.110
My principal only listens
to my department head,

01:56:18.270 --> 01:56:20.230
And she's not very supportive.

01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:22.070
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:24.950
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:27.190
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:30.110
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

01:56:30.310 --> 01:56:33.390
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

01:56:34.430 --> 01:56:37.390
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:40.390
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

01:56:40.470 --> 01:56:43.270
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

01:56:43.390 --> 01:56:45.190
I enforced that program.

01:56:45.270 --> 01:56:46.390
With all due respect,

01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:48.830
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

01:56:48.990 --> 01:56:50.390
Until they're old enough to disappear.

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.110
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

01:56:52.270 --> 01:56:54.830
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:58.470
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

01:56:58.590 --> 01:57:01.310
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

01:57:01.390 --> 01:57:04.110
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

01:57:04.230 --> 01:57:08.350
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

01:57:08.710 --> 01:57:10.190
I'm thinking trips.

01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:13.190
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:15.750
They haven't been given the opportunity

01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:18.390
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:19.870
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

01:57:19.990 --> 01:57:22.110
And it's purely a reward system.

01:57:22.270 --> 01:57:24.030
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

01:57:24.190 --> 01:57:26.270
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:27.710
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:28.870
Because of budget restrictions,

01:57:29.030 --> 01:57:30.150
She's not gonna approve school trips.

01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:31.710
I'll raise the money.

01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:34.470
I just need to know
I won't meet resistance.

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:36.950
See, I can't promise them anything
I can't deliver.

01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:39.510
It only proves what they already believe.

01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:45.270
All I'm saying is, Ms. Campbell
doesn't need to be bothered.

01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:50.550
You're a concierge at the Marriott?

01:57:50.670 --> 01:57:51.790
It's just weekends.

01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:53.830
You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:55.870
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.990
You want me to play golf?

01:57:57.150 --> 01:57:59.430
And the bonus is I get employee rates

01:57:59.510 --> 01:58:01.790
On Marriott hotel rooms
all over the world.

01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:02.870
I've heard a lot of hyphenates,

01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:06.470
But a bra-selling-English-teacher-
hotel-concierge has gotta be a new one.

01:58:06.590 --> 01:58:09.070
You told me your part-time job
was temporary.

01:58:09.190 --> 01:58:11.550
It is. I just don't know for how long.

01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:14.190
- What if I said no?
- No, what?

01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:18.870
- But I can make it work, Scott.
- No, that's not the point.

01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:21.390
You can do anything!
We know that already.

01:58:21.470 --> 01:58:24.510
It's just that I... You...

01:58:25.190 --> 01:58:26.950
You didn't even ask me.

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:31.470
- I'm just trying to do my job, Scott.
- By getting two more jobs?

01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:33.950
I don't understand, Erin.

01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:37.630
Scott, this is our time
to go after what we want,

01:58:37.710 --> 01:58:41.030
When we're young,
before we have a family.

01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:43.470
Maybe this is the perfect time
for you to go back to school,

01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:45.710
Get your architect's degree.

01:58:45.790 --> 01:58:47.710
Wouldn't that be great?

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:52.230
What?

01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:55.190
Nothing.

01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:03.870
So, I'll call you with a list of venues.

01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:06.070
I've scheduled a PTA board meeting
for next week.

01:59:06.230 --> 01:59:07.230
So, it should be no problem.

01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:08.430
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:09.080
I can't get involved
in inner school policy.

01:59:09.090 --> 01:59:09.770
My principal only listens
to my department head,

01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:10.280
And she's not very supportive.

01:59:10.290 --> 01:59:10.910
You'll have to find a way to deal with it.

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:11.680
No, I'd rather just deal directly
with someone in power.

01:59:11.690 --> 01:59:12.270
Ms. Gruwell, there's a system in place

01:59:12.280 --> 01:59:12.980
Based on years of running
an educational facility.

01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.670
- You have to follow that system.
- No. I won't.

01:59:13.680 --> 01:59:14.280
Look, I'm just trying to do my job here.

01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:15.000
What's the point
of a voluntary integration program

01:59:15.010 --> 01:59:15.890
If the kids making it to high school
have a 5th grade reading level?

01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:16.340
I enforced that program.

01:59:16.350 --> 01:59:16.760
With all due respect,

01:59:16.770 --> 01:59:17.480
All that program is doing
is warehousing these kids

01:59:17.490 --> 01:59:18.070
Until they're old enough to disappear.

01:59:18.080 --> 01:59:18.630
Look, I appreciate your intentions,

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:19.390
But there's nothing I can do
on a class-by-class basis.

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:20.130
Dr. Cohn, why should they waste
their time showing up

01:59:20.140 --> 01:59:20.860
When they know
we're wasting our time teaching them?

01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:21.550
We tell them, "Go to school.
Get an education. "

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:22.490
And then we say, "Well, they can't learn,
so let's not waste resources. "

01:59:22.500 --> 01:59:22.890
I'm thinking trips.

01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:23.610
Most of them have never
been outside of Long Beach.

01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:24.210
They haven't been given the opportunity

01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:24.990
To expand their thinking
about what's out there for them.

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:25.570
And they're hungry for it. I know it.

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:26.100
And it's purely a reward system.

01:59:26.110 --> 01:59:26.740
They won't get anything
they haven't earned

01:59:26.750 --> 01:59:27.390
By doing their work
and upping their grades.

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:28.000
But if Ms. Campbell
won't give you books

01:59:28.010 --> 01:59:28.520

01:59:28.530 --> 01:59:29.100

01:59:29.110 --> 01:59:29.520

01:59:29.530 --> 01:59:30.170

You play tennis with Evan on Saturdays.

01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:34.540
And you can play golf
with my dad on Sundays.

01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:35.000
You want me to play golf?

01:59:35.010 --> 01:59:35.580

- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:49.880
- Lovely to see you, Paula.
- Good to see you, too.

01:59:49.890 --> 01:59:50.230
- Hi.
- Hello.

01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:51.120
Principal Banning received a call
from Dr. Cohn at the school board.

01:59:51.130 --> 01:59:51.820
Apparently you're taking your students
on a trip?

01:59:51.830 --> 01:59:52.730
Yes, but it's over the weekend,
so it won't affect any test schedules.

01:59:52.740 --> 01:59:53.180
I know how busy you are,

01:59:53.190 --> 01:59:54.030
And since I'm paying for it myself,
I didn't want to bother you.

01:59:54.040 --> 01:59:54.430
I'll be right back.

01:59:54.440 --> 01:59:54.890
Oh, no. No, no, no. Erin?

01:59:54.900 --> 01:59:56.471
- Get back in the car.
- Dad, he lives right here.

01:59:56.573 --> 01:59:59.599
I'll get him.
Get back in the car and lock your door.

02:00:01.744 --> 02:00:04.235
- What's his name?
- Andre Bryant.

02:00:04.347 --> 02:00:05.314
Andre.

02:00:09.252 --> 02:00:13.416
<i>Since my pop split, my mom can't even
look at me, 'cause I look like my dad.</i>

02:00:13.923 --> 02:00:15.720
<i>And with my brother in jail,</i>

02:00:15.825 --> 02:00:18.794
<i>she looks at me and thinks
that's where I'm going, too.</i>

02:00:19.128 --> 02:00:20.755
<i>She doesn't see me.</i>

02:00:21.364 --> 02:00:23.389
<i>She doesn't see me at all.</i>

02:00:28.004 --> 02:00:29.494
I'm going out.

02:00:34.944 --> 02:00:35.968
- What up?
- Hey.

02:00:36.079 --> 02:00:37.979
Where you going? I need you.

02:00:38.448 --> 02:00:41.383
No, man, I can't now.
I got something to do.

02:00:41.518 --> 02:00:43.110
Tonight. I'll do it tonight.

02:00:43.253 --> 02:00:46.347
I gotta go do something,
and I can't carry that around with me.

02:00:46.756 --> 02:00:48.587
Forget it, man, I'll get somebody else.

02:00:48.691 --> 02:00:50.750
I can't be waiting all day on you.

02:00:51.394 --> 02:00:52.486
Hey.

02:00:53.963 --> 02:00:57.364
Sorry about your brother, man.
I hear he going away for life.

02:00:57.667 --> 02:01:00.101
They won't get it.
The guy he was with confessed.

02:01:00.203 --> 02:01:02.330
To who? Your brother?

02:01:03.039 --> 02:01:05.439
Hey. You Andre?

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.387
- What up?
- Hey.

02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:26.660
- What?
- Put on your seat belt.

02:01:30.033 --> 02:01:31.830
You, too, young lady.

02:01:35.305 --> 02:01:37.865
You kids ever been
to Newport Beach before?

02:01:38.074 --> 02:01:41.703
What? We went there last year
on our way to Paris.

02:01:47.984 --> 02:01:49.451
Paris.

02:01:53.856 --> 02:01:54.823
It's good.

02:01:55.158 --> 02:01:56.819
I brought you something.

02:02:00.930 --> 02:02:03.558
It's a good book. I read it in school.

02:02:03.666 --> 02:02:07.466
It's about a gang kid,
and I thought you might like to read it.

02:02:15.678 --> 02:02:18.511
He told me what I had to say
when I'm on the stand.

02:03:14.337 --> 02:03:18.398
<i>At the beginning of the tour, they give
you a card with a child's picture on it.</i>

02:03:18.574 --> 02:03:21.737
<i>You could find out who they were
and what camp they were sent to.</i>

02:03:21.844 --> 02:03:25.644
<i>And at the end of the tour,
you could find out if they survived.</i>

02:03:26.516 --> 02:03:28.780
<i>I got a little girl from Italy.</i>

02:03:43.099 --> 02:03:45.226
Tito, your hat.

02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:18.827
<i>Kristallnacht, they called it.
The Night of Broken Glass.</i>

02:04:18.935 --> 02:04:21.267
<i>Hundreds of synagogues
looted and burned.</i>

02:04:21.370 --> 02:04:24.134
<i>More than 7,000
Jewish stores destroyed.</i>

02:04:24.240 --> 02:04:26.333
<i>Over 100 Jews killed.</i>

02:04:39.122 --> 02:04:44.526
<i>A small center for children in Isieux
in the French province of Ain.</i>

02:04:45.228 --> 02:04:48.129
<i>Among the children deported that day
to Birkenau</i>

02:04:48.231 --> 02:04:51.598
<i>was 11-year-old Liliane Berenstein,</i>

02:04:51.701 --> 02:04:55.603
<i>who, before leaving,
left behind a letter to God.</i>

02:05:01.444 --> 02:05:06.074
<i>My little boy died.
He got off the train and they killed him.</i>

02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:08.743
<i>I don't know why
it bothered me so much.</i>

02:05:08.885 --> 02:05:11.012
<i>I've seen death all my life.</i>

02:05:11.287 --> 02:05:15.951
<i>But this little boy was only five.</i>

02:05:36.846 --> 02:05:40.373
<i>Ms. G had a beautiful dinner for us
at the hotel where she works.</i>

02:05:41.083 --> 02:05:45.042
<i>She invited real Holocaust survivors
from the museum to meet us.</i>

02:05:46.222 --> 02:05:48.019
<i>There was Elisabeth Mann.</i>

02:05:48.124 --> 02:05:52.662
I had my parents,
my sister, my two brothers.

02:05:52.962 --> 02:05:54.429
<i>Gloria Ungar.</i>

02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:57.124
If any of you have seen someone
with a number on their arm,

02:05:57.233 --> 02:05:59.224
These were the lucky people.

02:05:59.335 --> 02:06:01.769
The people who,
when we came to Auschwitz,

02:06:01.871 --> 02:06:05.671
When they tattooed the people
they took us to do the slave work.

02:06:05.775 --> 02:06:09.404
Not the others,
and that included many of my family.

02:06:09.512 --> 02:06:11.776
So, we ran away,
some of the young kids.

02:06:11.881 --> 02:06:14.315
I was at that time
11-and-a-half years old.

02:06:14.417 --> 02:06:15.441
<i>Eddie llam.</i>

02:06:15.585 --> 02:06:17.553
And where to go, I didn't know,

02:06:17.653 --> 02:06:21.384
But I remember one place
where I used to live.

02:06:21.490 --> 02:06:23.856
So when I ran there,
there was not one Jew left.

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:27.157
I was in the worst camp.
I was in Auschwitz.

02:06:27.263 --> 02:06:28.730
<i>And Renee Firestone.</i>

02:06:28.831 --> 02:06:32.733
When I arrived, my parents were
immediately taken away from me.

02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:36.468
My little sister,
who was then 14 years old,

02:06:36.505 --> 02:06:39.235
Stayed with me for a little while.

02:06:39.709 --> 02:06:42.906
And then later on,
I was separated from her also.

02:06:43.012 --> 02:06:45.640
<i>She lost her whole family at the camps.</i>

02:06:46.482 --> 02:06:50.578
<i>She came to this country with $4
in her pocket and a newborn baby.</i>

02:06:51.654 --> 02:06:53.815
<i>I'll never forget these people.</i>

02:06:53.956 --> 02:06:56.754
And then she was killed
because they didn't want...

02:06:56.859 --> 02:06:59.760
<i>I can't believe Ms. G did all of this
for us.</i>

02:07:07.303 --> 02:07:08.895
<i>Hi, honey, it's me.</i>

02:07:09.005 --> 02:07:11.599
<i>Look, we're still at the restaurant,
if you wanted to drop by.</i>

02:07:11.707 --> 02:07:13.334
<i>We haven't even ordered dessert yet,</i>

02:07:13.442 --> 02:07:15.808
<i>and the kids are having
such an incredible time.</i>

02:07:15.912 --> 02:07:17.675
<i>You have to see them.</i>

02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:20.840
<i>If you get in soon, come by.
It's only 9:30 now.</i>

02:07:22.251 --> 02:07:26.688
<i>Okay, I'll see you later. Love you. Bye.</i>

02:07:58.220 --> 02:08:00.154
How many times
I gotta tell your ass again?

02:08:00.256 --> 02:08:02.383
Get your butt in here!

02:08:34.690 --> 02:08:37.158
So, you had all summer
to read and consider this book.

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:45.063
And you know,
I thought it would be most valuable

02:08:45.768 --> 02:08:51.172
To begin with Victoria
to give us the black perspective.

02:08:52.742 --> 02:08:54.039
Victoria?

02:08:54.844 --> 02:08:56.835
<i>Do I have a stamp
on my forehead that says,</i>

02:08:56.946 --> 02:08:59.506
<i>"The National Spokesperson
for the Plight of Black People"?</i>

02:08:59.749 --> 02:09:02.912
<i>How the hell should I know the black
perspective on The Color Purple?</i>

02:09:03.052 --> 02:09:06.488
<i>That's it, if I don't change classes,
I'm gonna hurt this fool.</i>

02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:08.648
<i>Teachers treat me like
I'm some kind of Rosetta stone</i>

02:09:08.791 --> 02:09:10.224
<i>for African-Americans.</i>

02:09:10.326 --> 02:09:12.089
<i>What? Black people learn how to read,</i>

02:09:12.194 --> 02:09:14.890
<i>and we all miraculously come
to the same conclusion?</i>

02:09:14.997 --> 02:09:18.592
<i>At that point, I decided to check out
my friend Brandy's English class.</i>

02:09:18.701 --> 02:09:20.168
- Good to see you, man.
- Hey, yeah.

02:09:20.269 --> 02:09:22.328
- How was your summer?
- Great.

02:09:26.842 --> 02:09:28.810
You're still white, I see.

02:09:29.445 --> 02:09:31.310
Okay, everybody. Ready?

02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:32.606
- Hey, Ms. G.
- Hi.

02:09:32.715 --> 02:09:34.046
- Hi, Ms. G.
- Hi.

02:09:43.492 --> 02:09:46.984
Okay, guys, gals, listen up!
This is what I want you to do.

02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:51.325
I want each of you to step forward
and take one of these Borders bags,

02:09:51.434 --> 02:09:54.335
Which contain the four books
we're gonna read this semester.

02:09:54.437 --> 02:09:55.665
All right!

02:09:56.405 --> 02:09:58.703
They're very special books,

02:09:58.808 --> 02:10:03.268
And they each remind me,
in some way, of each of you.

02:10:07.183 --> 02:10:10.448
But, before you take the books,

02:10:11.087 --> 02:10:14.887
I want you to take one of these glasses
of sparkling cider,

02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:18.790
And I want each of you to make a toast.

02:10:20.096 --> 02:10:23.588
We're each gonna make
a toast for change.

02:10:24.033 --> 02:10:28.595
And what that means is,
from this moment on

02:10:29.171 --> 02:10:34.507
Every voice that told you
"You can't" is silenced.

02:10:35.644 --> 02:10:40.911
Every reason that tells you things
will never change, disappears.

02:10:42.451 --> 02:10:45.919
And the person you were
before this moment,

02:10:45.954 --> 02:10:49.388
That person's turn is over.
Now it's your turn.

02:10:50.326 --> 02:10:51.623
Okay?

02:10:52.728 --> 02:10:56.687
Okay, you ready to get
this party going on?

02:10:59.668 --> 02:11:01.295
- What?
- Stop doing that, man.

02:11:01.403 --> 02:11:02.961
What's the dealio?

02:11:11.213 --> 02:11:14.239
Man, I've had boyfriends since I was,
like, 11, you know.

02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:17.714
- I believe you.
- Shut up.

02:11:18.120 --> 02:11:21.248
Okay, well, I was always the person

02:11:21.390 --> 02:11:24.826
That was gonna get pregnant
before I turned 16 and drop out.

02:11:25.728 --> 02:11:27.093
Like my mom.

02:11:31.066 --> 02:11:32.499
Ain't gonna happen.

02:11:32.735 --> 02:11:34.930
Nobody ever listens to a teenager.

02:11:35.671 --> 02:11:39.300
Everybody thinks you should be happy
just because you're young.

02:11:39.408 --> 02:11:42.434
They don't see the wars
that we fight every single day.

02:11:43.212 --> 02:11:45.043
And one day, my war will end.

02:11:45.514 --> 02:11:47.277
And I will not die.

02:11:48.751 --> 02:11:52.187
And I will not tolerate abuse
from anyone.

02:11:55.724 --> 02:11:57.055
I am strong.

02:11:57.159 --> 02:12:00.390
My moms kicked me out
when I got jumped into the gang life.

02:12:01.564 --> 02:12:03.862
But I'd like her to see me graduate.

02:12:05.467 --> 02:12:07.264
I'd like to be 18.

02:12:11.574 --> 02:12:15.101
Ms. G?
Can I read something from my diary?

02:12:15.211 --> 02:12:16.678
That'd be great.

02:12:20.649 --> 02:12:22.310
Who is he?

02:12:22.451 --> 02:12:24.544
Man, he's been with us
from freshman year, fool.

02:12:24.687 --> 02:12:27.588
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

02:12:29.158 --> 02:12:33.618
"This summer was the worst summer
in my short 14 years of life.

02:12:34.330 --> 02:12:36.525
"It all started with a phone call.

02:12:36.966 --> 02:12:39.400
"My mother was crying and begging,

02:12:39.501 --> 02:12:44.461
"asking for more time as if she were
gasping for her last breath of air.

02:12:45.474 --> 02:12:48.534
"She held me as tight
as she could and cried.

02:12:48.644 --> 02:12:54.082
"Her tears hit my shirt like bullets
and told me we were being evicted.

02:12:54.483 --> 02:12:58.442
"She kept apologizing to me.
I thought, 'I have no home.

02:12:58.554 --> 02:13:02.354
"'I should have asked for something
less expensive at Christmas. '

02:13:02.458 --> 02:13:06.326
"On the morning of the eviction,
a hard knock on the door woke me up.

02:13:06.428 --> 02:13:09.056
"The sheriff was there to do his job.

02:13:09.965 --> 02:13:13.492
"I looked up at the sky,
waiting for something to happen.

02:13:15.337 --> 02:13:18.898
"My mother has no family to lean on,
no money coming in.

02:13:19.475 --> 02:13:23.138
"Why bother coming to school
or getting good grades if I'm homeless?

02:13:23.779 --> 02:13:27.647
"The bus stops in front of the school.
I feel like throwing up.

02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:32.517
"I'm wearing clothes from last year,
some old shoes and no new haircut.

02:13:33.255 --> 02:13:35.587
"I kept thinking I'd get laughed at.

02:13:35.624 --> 02:13:38.092
"Instead, I'm greeted
by a couple of friends

02:13:38.193 --> 02:13:40.525
"who were in my English class last year.

02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:43.530
"And it hits me, Mrs. Gruwell,

02:13:43.632 --> 02:13:45.896
"my crazy English teacher
from last year,

02:13:46.001 --> 02:13:48.663
"is the only person
that made me think of hope.

02:13:49.738 --> 02:13:53.196
"Talking with friends
about last year's English and our trips,

02:13:53.309 --> 02:13:55.334
"I began to feel better.

02:13:55.944 --> 02:14:00.904
"I receive my schedule and the first
teacher is Mrs. Gruwell in Room 203.

02:14:01.250 --> 02:14:04.351
"I walk into the room and feel as though

02:14:04.386 --> 02:14:08.015
"all the problems in life
are not so important anymore.

02:14:08.657 --> 02:14:10.124
"I am home. "

02:14:12.127 --> 02:14:13.594
Yes, you are.

02:14:34.216 --> 02:14:36.047
But you're an honors student.

02:14:36.118 --> 02:14:37.710
If you transfer to Ms. Gruwell's class,

02:14:37.853 --> 02:14:39.878
Think how that will reflect
on your records.

02:14:40.022 --> 02:14:43.219
It doesn't matter to me.
My grades will still be the same.

02:14:43.525 --> 02:14:45.390
Look, Ms. Campbell.

02:14:45.494 --> 02:14:49.089
When I first transferred to the school,
I had a 4.0 average.

02:14:49.431 --> 02:14:52.889
But when I applied for advanced
placement at English and Math,

02:14:53.001 --> 02:14:55.936
I was told it would be better for me
to be in a class with my own kind.

02:14:56.038 --> 02:14:58.973
Now, when I did get in, my teacher said,

02:14:59.074 --> 02:15:02.703
"Victoria, it's not every day one finds
an African-American student

02:15:02.811 --> 02:15:06.679
"in A. P. And honors courses. "
As if I didn't notice.

02:15:06.782 --> 02:15:09.182
And when I asked
another honors teacher

02:15:09.318 --> 02:15:11.946
Why we don't read more
black literature, she said,

02:15:12.221 --> 02:15:14.189
"We don't read black literature
because of all the sex,

02:15:14.323 --> 02:15:16.484
"drugs, cussing and fornication!"

02:15:18.627 --> 02:15:23.257
I thought a simple "It's inappropriate"
would have sufficed.

02:15:27.469 --> 02:15:29.403
Erin can't do that!

02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:32.071
Distinguished Honor Students are mine.

02:15:32.674 --> 02:15:35.165
She's not allowed to teach them.
She's only been here a year.

02:15:35.210 --> 02:15:36.802
The student requested it.

02:15:36.912 --> 02:15:39.506
And Gruwell has got Cohn
in her back pocket.

02:15:40.783 --> 02:15:45.720
What gets me is they're violent, they
break laws, they destroy school property

02:15:45.954 --> 02:15:50.993
And in the end we make them special.
We reward them like...

02:15:51.028 --> 02:15:53.359
I just don't see what that teaches them.

02:15:54.096 --> 02:15:56.496
Hi! Sorry I'm late.

02:15:56.865 --> 02:15:58.958
Did you eat? I'm ordering in.
Are you hungry?

02:15:59.067 --> 02:16:00.932
What question do you want me
to answer first?

02:16:01.036 --> 02:16:03.937
Did I eat or am I hungry?
I ate. I'm not hungry.

02:16:04.039 --> 02:16:07.304
Something really cool happened today.
I got an honors student.

02:16:07.409 --> 02:16:09.309
- Congratulations.
- Isn't that great?

02:16:09.411 --> 02:16:11.345
She actually requested my class.

02:16:11.447 --> 02:16:13.415
Can you teach an honors student?

02:16:13.782 --> 02:16:14.806
What do you mean?

02:16:14.917 --> 02:16:17.715
Well, I mean, you're used
to teaching your kind of kids.

02:16:17.853 --> 02:16:20.321
Can you teach somebody who's smart?

02:16:20.956 --> 02:16:22.116
Of course I can.

02:16:22.257 --> 02:16:24.122
Yeah, but it's not like you have, right?

02:16:24.226 --> 02:16:27.457
I mean, you don't really teach
what everybody else teaches.

02:16:29.031 --> 02:16:30.726
My kids' grades are up to B's.

02:16:30.899 --> 02:16:33.333
Yeah, but the point is,
that's according to you.

02:16:33.434 --> 02:16:36.233
It's not like they're really learning
what normal kids have to learn.

02:16:36.271 --> 02:16:38.136
Normal kids? Yes, they are.

02:16:38.240 --> 02:16:39.730
<i>They're reading
The Diary of Anne Frank.</i>

02:16:39.842 --> 02:16:42.208
They're learning vocabulary,
grammar, writing, poetry.

02:16:42.311 --> 02:16:44.609
All right. Okay, I apologize. Sorry.

02:16:45.547 --> 02:16:47.105
Congratulations.

02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:56.248
What is wrong with you?

02:16:56.391 --> 02:16:58.382
You know, at Deb's party,
I heard you telling people

02:16:58.527 --> 02:17:00.893
That I was an architect
and that my job was temporary.

02:17:00.995 --> 02:17:04.022
I want you to stop that, all right?
I like my job.

02:17:04.132 --> 02:17:05.224
Fine.

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:08.294
You're the one who said
you were gonna be an architect.

02:17:08.403 --> 02:17:10.428
Yeah, four years ago,
before we got married.

02:17:10.539 --> 02:17:12.130
What, I'm gonna go back to school now

02:17:12.241 --> 02:17:14.141
For two years and intern for three?

02:17:14.243 --> 02:17:15.733
I'll be over 40.

02:17:15.843 --> 02:17:17.869
All right. I thought you still wanted it.

02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:22.007
It doesn't matter if I want it, Erin.
It doesn't mean it's going to happen.

02:17:24.186 --> 02:17:25.448
Why not?

02:17:34.663 --> 02:17:38.656
<i>"Writing in a diary is a really strange
experience for someone like me.</i>

02:17:38.799 --> 02:17:41.530
<i>"I mean, not only because
I've never written anything before,</i>

02:17:41.670 --> 02:17:43.968

02:18:57.446 --> 02:19:00.505
- What?
- You know. Take him out?

02:19:00.616 --> 02:19:05.212
<i>Eva, this is The Diary of Anne Frank,
not Die Hard.</i>

02:19:06.088 --> 02:19:07.555
Keep reading.

02:19:10.092 --> 02:19:12.287
<i>"We talked about
the most private things,</i>

02:19:12.394 --> 02:19:15.795
<i>"but we haven't yet touched upon
the things closest to my heart.</i>

02:19:15.897 --> 02:19:18.422
<i>"I still can't make heads
or tails of Peter.</i>

02:19:18.532 --> 02:19:20.296
<i>"Is he superficial?</i>

02:19:20.434 --> 02:19:23.835
<i>"Or is it shyness that holds him back,
even with me?"</i>

02:19:29.477 --> 02:19:33.073
- Are Anne and Peter gonna hook up?
- I'm not telling you.

02:19:34.449 --> 02:19:37.509
<i>"It's utterly impossible for me
to build my life on a foundation</i>

02:19:37.552 --> 02:19:40.419
<i>"of chaos, suffering and death.</i>

02:19:41.223 --> 02:19:44.852
<i>"I see the world being
slowly transformed into a wilderness.</i>

02:19:44.959 --> 02:19:48.760
<i>"I feel the suffering of millions,
and yet when I look up at the sky</i>

02:19:49.131 --> 02:19:52.862
<i>"I somehow feel that everything
will change for the better. "</i>

02:19:57.739 --> 02:20:01.106
- Eva, what's wrong?
- Why didn't you tell me she dies?

02:20:01.376 --> 02:20:03.640
Why you didn't tell me she gets caught
in the end?

02:20:04.046 --> 02:20:06.173
I hate you and I hate this book.

02:20:06.281 --> 02:20:07.248
Eva.

02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:11.581
If she dies, then what about me?
What are you saying about that?

02:20:12.788 --> 02:20:15.416
- Anne Frank died, but she...
- I can't believe they got her!

02:20:15.524 --> 02:20:18.152
That ain't supposed to happen
in the story! That ain't right!

02:20:18.260 --> 02:20:19.989
- 'Cause it's true?
- I ain't talking to you!

02:20:20.095 --> 02:20:22.791
You're talking around me.
That's the same thing.

02:20:22.898 --> 02:20:24.729
See, to me, she ain't dead at all.

02:20:24.833 --> 02:20:27.529
How many friends did you know
that are dead now that got killed?

02:20:27.669 --> 02:20:29.000
Too many to count.

02:20:29.104 --> 02:20:31.538
How many have you read a book about?

02:20:31.807 --> 02:20:34.776
Have you seen them on TV
or even in the newspaper?

02:20:34.843 --> 02:20:36.470
That's why this story's dope.

02:20:36.578 --> 02:20:38.341
She was our age, man.

02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:41.972
Anne Frank understands our situation,
my situation.

02:20:42.084 --> 02:20:45.019
And that Miep Gies lady,
the one that helped hide them?

02:20:45.120 --> 02:20:46.348
I like her.

02:20:46.455 --> 02:20:48.889
I got all these other books
about her from the library.

02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:51.857
Wow. You used your library card?

02:20:53.795 --> 02:20:54.853
No.

02:20:57.132 --> 02:21:01.899
Okay, listen up.
Marcus has given me an idea.

02:21:02.404 --> 02:21:05.896
<i>Instead of doing a book report on
The Diary of Anne Frank,</i>

02:21:06.041 --> 02:21:09.977
For our assignment I want you
to write a letter to Miep Gies,

02:21:10.078 --> 02:21:12.342
The woman who helped shelter
the Franks.

02:21:12.447 --> 02:21:15.905
She's still alive and she lives in Europe.

02:21:16.017 --> 02:21:18.781
In the letter, I want you to tell her
how you feel about the book.

02:21:18.887 --> 02:21:21.378
Tell her about your own experiences.
Tell her anything you like.

02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:23.651
But I want the letters to be perfect,

02:21:23.759 --> 02:21:26.193
So be prepared to do more
than one draft, okay?

02:21:26.294 --> 02:21:27.761
Is she gonna read the letters?

02:21:27.863 --> 02:21:30.263
Well, right now it's
a writing assignment. I'll read them.

02:21:30.432 --> 02:21:31.990
We should get her to read them.

02:21:32.134 --> 02:21:35.194
- Yeah, you can do that, right, Ms. G?
- Well, I don't know.

02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:36.635
Maybe we should get her
to come and speak.

02:21:36.738 --> 02:21:38.569
Yeah, and have a big dinner again.

02:21:40.342 --> 02:21:42.173
Wait. Guys.

02:21:45.380 --> 02:21:48.975
Guys! Everyone! Listen! She's elderly!

02:21:49.084 --> 02:21:51.552
I don't know how to contact her.
I don't even know if she travels.

02:21:51.653 --> 02:21:53.280
And it would be really expensive.

02:21:53.388 --> 02:21:55.083
We could raise the money.

02:21:56.024 --> 02:21:57.082
Ms. G?

02:21:57.192 --> 02:22:01.151
When Miep Gies come,
can I, like, be the one to escort her in?

02:22:21.016 --> 02:22:22.313
Five.

02:22:35.730 --> 02:22:37.129
Hi, I'm trying to get the number

02:22:37.232 --> 02:22:39.723
For the Anne Frank Foundation
in Basel, Switzerland.

02:23:54.509 --> 02:23:56.067
Come in, Margaret.

02:24:42.691 --> 02:24:45.489
<i>Ms. G sent our letters all the way
to Amsterdam</i>

02:24:45.593 --> 02:24:47.390
<i>to Miep Gies, herself.</i>

02:24:47.595 --> 02:24:49.790
<i>When Ms. G made up her mind
about something,</i>

02:24:49.898 --> 02:24:52.389
<i>there was no stopping her,
man, for real.</i>

02:24:59.708 --> 02:25:03.838
<i>And after we raised the money to bring
her to Long Beach, there she was.</i>

02:25:06.247 --> 02:25:10.047
<i>But, damn,
I didn't expect her to be so small.</i>

02:25:28.703 --> 02:25:32.230
The bounty on a Jew was about $2.

02:25:33.108 --> 02:25:36.373
Someone desperate for money
told the Gestapo.

02:25:36.411 --> 02:25:40.279
On August 4th,
they stormed into my office,

02:25:40.982 --> 02:25:47.353
And a man pointed a gun at
me and said, "Not a sound.

02:25:47.856 --> 02:25:49.483
"Not one word. "

02:25:50.625 --> 02:25:53.253
And then they went straight upstairs
to the attic.

02:25:53.795 --> 02:25:56.229
I felt so helpless.

02:25:56.331 --> 02:25:58.891
I could hear Anne screaming,
objects being thrown around.

02:25:59.034 --> 02:26:01.764
So, I ran back to my house.

02:26:01.903 --> 02:26:04.633
I looked for an earring
or knick-knacks, you know,

02:26:04.739 --> 02:26:07.503
Anything I could take back with me
to bribe them.

02:26:07.642 --> 02:26:10.941
So I took this back with me,
all these things,

02:26:11.046 --> 02:26:15.346
And the soldier there took out his gun

02:26:15.984 --> 02:26:18.179
And put it against my head.

02:26:22.757 --> 02:26:27.353
You could be shot for hiding a Jew
or go to a camp.

02:26:28.063 --> 02:26:32.022
So, another soldier
recognized my accent.

02:26:32.233 --> 02:26:35.930
He was Austrian, and so was I,

02:26:36.371 --> 02:26:39.135
But I had been adopted
by a Dutch family.

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:43.040
So, he told the soldier with the gun
to let me go.

02:26:44.946 --> 02:26:49.474
There isn't a day
that I don't remember August 4th

02:26:50.785 --> 02:26:54.619
And I think about Anne Frank.

02:26:57.192 --> 02:26:58.284
Yes?

02:27:06.167 --> 02:27:08.260
I've never had a hero before.

02:27:09.170 --> 02:27:10.637
But you are my hero.

02:27:11.106 --> 02:27:14.803
Oh, no. No, no, young man, no.

02:27:14.909 --> 02:27:17.605
I am not a hero. No.

02:27:17.712 --> 02:27:24.242
I did what I had to do,
because it was the right thing to do.

02:27:24.652 --> 02:27:26.051
That is all.

02:27:28.089 --> 02:27:30.922
You know, we are all ordinary people.

02:27:31.626 --> 02:27:38.464
But even an ordinary secretary
or a housewife or a teenager

02:27:39.868 --> 02:27:45.773
Can, within their own small ways,
turn on a small light

02:27:48.276 --> 02:27:50.073
In a dark room.

02:27:50.645 --> 02:27:51.805
<i>Ja?</i>

02:27:56.017 --> 02:27:59.578
I have read your letters,

02:27:59.687 --> 02:28:04.454
And your teacher has been telling me
many things about your experiences.

02:28:06.594 --> 02:28:09.392
You are the heroes.

02:28:10.698 --> 02:28:14.327
You are heroes every day.

02:28:21.209 --> 02:28:24.645
Your faces are engraved in my heart.

02:28:44.332 --> 02:28:45.697
You hungry?

02:28:50.138 --> 02:28:52.902
You know what you're gonna say
in that courtroom?

02:28:53.541 --> 02:28:55.509
I know what I have to say.

02:28:57.212 --> 02:28:58.304
Yeah.

02:28:58.980 --> 02:29:01.244
- You know how that is.
- I know.

02:29:02.617 --> 02:29:05.245
And that man that put your father
in prison,

02:29:05.353 --> 02:29:08.015
He knew he was sending
an innocent man.

02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:09.686
But, you know,

02:29:11.626 --> 02:29:13.218
He was just

02:29:15.296 --> 02:29:17.025
Protecting his own.

02:29:23.238 --> 02:29:25.934
What the hell does everybody
want from me?

02:29:52.734 --> 02:29:54.702
Hey, Mama. Mama.

02:30:00.308 --> 02:30:02.708
What the hell are you doing here?

02:30:09.017 --> 02:30:12.953
I want to come home.
I don't want to be in the streets no more.

02:30:13.054 --> 02:30:14.351
I'm sorry.

02:30:16.858 --> 02:30:19.986
I want to change. I can't do it alone.

02:30:21.896 --> 02:30:23.523
I need you, Mama.

02:30:25.333 --> 02:30:26.800
I need you.

02:31:04.472 --> 02:31:06.235
And what time was that?

02:31:07.108 --> 02:31:09.406
I told you, 9:00, 9:30.

02:31:10.078 --> 02:31:11.545
And you had a clear view
of the defendant,

02:31:11.646 --> 02:31:13.511
Grant Rice, in the store?

02:31:14.716 --> 02:31:17.082
I told you he was playing
the video game.

02:31:17.685 --> 02:31:20.153
Then what happened?
What did you see?

02:31:20.588 --> 02:31:22.681
Well, he got all whacked
because he lost the game,

02:31:22.824 --> 02:31:26.419
And then he started shouting and all,
threatening everybody.

02:31:26.527 --> 02:31:29.724
He threatened everyone?
He threatened you?

02:31:30.832 --> 02:31:33.266
No. The guy who ran the store.

02:31:33.401 --> 02:31:35.426
He wanted his money back
for the game.

02:31:35.470 --> 02:31:37.495
And what did the store owner do?

02:31:38.339 --> 02:31:41.638
He shouted back.
And they were fighting.

02:31:41.909 --> 02:31:46.175
Then he, the defendant, knocked
something over and left the store.

02:31:46.748 --> 02:31:49.239
And then what happened?
What did you see?

02:31:53.421 --> 02:31:55.048
I saw...

02:32:07.235 --> 02:32:08.702
I saw...

02:32:23.985 --> 02:32:25.452
Paco did it.

02:32:29.624 --> 02:32:31.353
Paco killed the guy.

02:33:56.978 --> 02:33:59.469
My father won't talk to me anymore.

02:34:01.849 --> 02:34:07.219
And I have to lay low for a little while
because there's word out to jump me.

02:34:08.623 --> 02:34:10.921
So I'm gonna be living with my aunt.

02:34:12.393 --> 02:34:17.353
See, my aunt lives even further away,

02:34:19.433 --> 02:34:23.733
So I was just wondering if I could, like,

02:34:26.874 --> 02:34:28.658
Stay here late with you

02:34:28.693 --> 02:34:30.443
Stay here late with you

02:34:32.313 --> 02:34:36.807
So I can get my homework done,
'cause it's late by the time I get home.

02:34:39.287 --> 02:34:42.256
You can stay as late as you want.

02:34:43.624 --> 02:34:47.583
And I can even drive you to your aunt's,
if it gets too late.

02:34:50.831 --> 02:34:52.662
Ms. G, let's not get nuts.

02:35:28.436 --> 02:35:30.370
I think I got your color.

02:36:17.051 --> 02:36:19.042
Just come by the concierge
on your way out,

02:36:19.153 --> 02:36:21.917
I'll have the directions for you.
Yep, that's fine.

02:36:28.963 --> 02:36:32.763
Stop! That's it! Now, now! Hey!

02:36:34.502 --> 02:36:36.970
You get an extra three seconds. Go!

02:36:43.144 --> 02:36:45.408
<i>... enraged them and provoked them
into acts of violence.</i>

02:36:45.513 --> 02:36:49.779
<i>In 1961, an interracial civil rights group
traveled by bus through the South</i>

02:36:49.884 --> 02:36:51.613
<i>to challenge segregation.</i>

02:36:51.719 --> 02:36:54.586
<i>Blacks sat in the front,
whites in the back.</i>

02:36:55.056 --> 02:36:58.583
<i>They were attacked, firebombed,
but they kept going.</i>

02:36:59.193 --> 02:37:03.357
<i>In Montgomery, Alabama, Jim Zwerg
offered to be the first off the bus,</i>

02:37:03.464 --> 02:37:05.830
<i>knowing there was a mob
waiting for them.</i>

02:37:05.966 --> 02:37:08.935
<i>He was almost beaten to death
so the others could get away.</i>

02:37:09.036 --> 02:37:12.528
<i>That kind of courage
is unbelievable to me.</i>

02:37:12.673 --> 02:37:16.040
<i>I was afraid of just being in this class,
and I was ashamed</i>

02:37:16.143 --> 02:37:19.909
<i>because I've always been the dumb kid
in school, even with my friends.</i>

02:37:20.081 --> 02:37:21.446
<i>But not anymore.</i>

02:37:21.615 --> 02:37:23.139
<i>And I must have some kind of courage,</i>

02:37:23.250 --> 02:37:26.981
<i>because I could have lied
to get out of here, but I stayed.</i>

02:37:28.055 --> 02:37:29.352
<i>I stayed.</i>

02:37:29.790 --> 02:37:31.087
Hi, I'm home!

02:37:31.692 --> 02:37:36.629
Sorry, it got late. I drove the kids home.
I didn't want them taking buses.

02:37:37.164 --> 02:37:39.530
You're never gonna believe
what happened.

02:37:40.901 --> 02:37:42.562
I'm so tired.

02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:45.937
It's so cute, though.
They never want to go home.

02:37:46.607 --> 02:37:49.838
We have such a good time together.
I'm gonna take a shower.

02:38:09.463 --> 02:38:12.557
If you have another glass,
you're gonna have a headache.

02:38:13.334 --> 02:38:17.737
Your bags are packed and you think
the wine's gonna give me a headache?

02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:21.503
Why are you doing this?

02:38:21.609 --> 02:38:24.874
Because I don't
pay enough attention to you?

02:38:24.979 --> 02:38:26.947
No. That's not it.

02:38:29.316 --> 02:38:33.377
I just... I feel like I'm living a life
I just did not agree to.

02:38:35.723 --> 02:38:37.350
Erin, it's just...

02:38:38.592 --> 02:38:40.082
It's too hard.

02:38:40.694 --> 02:38:42.855
Your life is too hard?

02:38:43.364 --> 02:38:45.889
I think what you're doing is noble.

02:38:46.500 --> 02:38:50.061
And it's good. And I'm proud of you.

02:38:50.671 --> 02:38:51.968
I am.

02:38:54.308 --> 02:38:57.607
I just want to live my life
and not feel bad about it.

02:38:57.711 --> 02:39:00.874
- I'm not trying to make you feel bad.
- You don't have to try.

02:39:00.981 --> 02:39:03.779
I didn't plan on becoming responsible
for these kids.

02:39:03.884 --> 02:39:05.909
- Well, who asked you to?
- No one asked me to!

02:39:06.020 --> 02:39:07.009
They're not even your kids!

02:39:07.121 --> 02:39:10.921
Why do I have to be asked? Scott...

02:39:15.062 --> 02:39:19.965
I finally realized what I'm
supposed to be doing and I love it.

02:39:20.100 --> 02:39:24.764
When I'm helping these kids
make sense of their lives,

02:39:25.406 --> 02:39:28.239
Everything about my life
makes sense to me.

02:39:31.779 --> 02:39:34.145
How often does a person get that?

02:39:37.451 --> 02:39:41.547
- Then what do you need me for?
- You're my husband.

02:39:41.655 --> 02:39:46.558
Why can't you stand by me and be part
of it, the way wives support husbands?

02:39:46.660 --> 02:39:48.525
Because I can't be your wife.

02:39:55.836 --> 02:39:58.134
I wish I could make that
sound less awful.

02:40:00.307 --> 02:40:01.467
Erin?

02:40:03.077 --> 02:40:05.637
You know,
if you had to choose between us

02:40:07.147 --> 02:40:08.774
And the class,

02:40:10.584 --> 02:40:12.017
Who would you pick?

02:40:14.054 --> 02:40:17.512
If you love me,
how could you ever ask me that?

02:40:18.492 --> 02:40:20.119
Erin, look at me.

02:40:23.631 --> 02:40:25.792
This is all there's ever been to me.

02:40:26.166 --> 02:40:30.535
This is it. I'm not one of those kids.
I don't have any more potential.

02:40:32.373 --> 02:40:33.897
See? You don't want to be here either,

02:40:34.041 --> 02:40:37.374
'cause if you did, would you be
in the classroom every night?

02:40:38.712 --> 02:40:43.342
That's not true. I want to be here.
I love you.

02:40:44.518 --> 02:40:46.486
You love the idea of me.

02:40:52.026 --> 02:40:54.324
But it's such a great idea.

02:40:57.998 --> 02:40:59.295
I know.

02:41:27.361 --> 02:41:29.158
Dad? Hi.

02:41:31.765 --> 02:41:34.962
You know, I was actually trying
to call someone else,

02:41:35.102 --> 02:41:37.070
And I automatically dialed you. I'm sorry.

02:41:37.104 --> 02:41:39.664
Look, I'm gonna call you tomorrow,
okay?

02:41:39.807 --> 02:41:43.106
I need to make this call. I love you.

02:41:56.156 --> 02:41:58.647
<i>Ms. G made us read Twelve Angry Men.</i>

02:41:58.759 --> 02:42:02.396
<i>It's all about how this one juror
helped to turn the hearts of 11 jurors.</i>

02:42:02.431 --> 02:42:04.261
<i>It made me feel hopeful.</i>

02:42:04.798 --> 02:42:08.063
<i>At 2:00 today, my brother
was given a verdict on his own trial.</i>

02:42:08.202 --> 02:42:10.830
<i>No O. J. Dream Team,
just a court-appointed attorney</i>

02:42:10.971 --> 02:42:12.939
<i>who probably thought
his ass was guilty.</i>

02:42:13.073 --> 02:42:16.702
<i>And I realized Twelve Angry Men
was just a book and nothing more.</i>

02:42:17.044 --> 02:42:19.774
<i>My brother got 15 years to life.</i>

02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:22.610
<i>Justice don't mean
the bad guy goes to jail.</i>

02:42:22.716 --> 02:42:24.911
<i>It just means somebody
pays for the crime.</i>

02:42:30.758 --> 02:42:32.282
So, you got time now?

02:42:39.166 --> 02:42:40.758
Anyone know where Andre's been?

02:42:40.901 --> 02:42:42.163
I haven't seen him on the bus.

02:42:42.302 --> 02:42:43.769
Yeah, I haven't talked to him either.

02:42:52.679 --> 02:42:54.203
Ms. G?

02:42:54.581 --> 02:42:56.913
Are we gonna have
this same room next year, again?

02:42:57.017 --> 02:43:00.145
I don't know.
You're gonna be juniors next year.

02:43:01.688 --> 02:43:03.212
What do you mean?

02:43:03.323 --> 02:43:06.019
Well, I teach freshman
and sophomore years.

02:43:06.126 --> 02:43:09.254
You mean,
we're not gonna be with you next year?

02:43:11.965 --> 02:43:13.330
Well, I...

02:43:15.202 --> 02:43:18.933
I don't teach juniors.
I thought you guys understood that.

02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:20.566
What? What are you talking about?

02:43:22.776 --> 02:43:24.403
You don't wanna be our teacher
next year?

02:43:24.511 --> 02:43:27.036
Of course I do. I can't.

02:43:27.147 --> 02:43:29.638
- Why not?
- It's the Board of Ed.

02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:31.684
It's regulations.

02:43:34.421 --> 02:43:37.219
Ms. G hasn't been here long enough
to have seniority.

02:43:37.257 --> 02:43:38.588
Who cares about seniority?

02:43:38.725 --> 02:43:41.285
Shit! They can't do that!
They don't have the right!

02:43:43.397 --> 02:43:46.195
- Ms. G, this is our kick-it spot.
- Yeah.

02:43:46.333 --> 02:43:49.769
Everybody's cool with everybody.
Everybody knows everybody.

02:43:49.903 --> 02:43:53.339
This is the only place
where we really get to be ourselves.

02:43:53.474 --> 02:43:55.499
There's no place like this
out there for us.

02:43:55.776 --> 02:43:57.175
That's true.

02:43:57.678 --> 02:44:00.238
I'm not allowed
to teach junior and seniors.

02:44:00.380 --> 02:44:01.347
You're not allowed?

02:44:03.383 --> 02:44:07.012
Ms. G, we can fight this, you know,
like the Freedom Riders.

02:44:07.121 --> 02:44:08.884
Yeah, yeah,
we'll all drive around on a bus.

02:44:08.989 --> 02:44:10.980
Only this time, they try and bust us up,

02:44:11.091 --> 02:44:12.888
We bust a few of them
board members' heads.

02:44:13.527 --> 02:44:14.516
Marcus.

02:44:14.628 --> 02:44:18.257
Or we can go to the newspapers,
media. That'll get their attention.

02:44:18.499 --> 02:44:19.966
Or we can paint
the administration building

02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:22.568
With the word "assholes"
in various colors.

02:44:24.304 --> 02:44:25.999
Hey, it's something. We can do this.

02:44:31.445 --> 02:44:32.412
What?

02:44:32.513 --> 02:44:36.074
These are my books, not Scott's.
I'm packing the wrong books.

02:44:36.183 --> 02:44:37.878
Honey, take a break.

02:44:41.822 --> 02:44:43.289
Sit down.

02:44:46.460 --> 02:44:49.054
I can't believe I'm getting divorced.

02:44:50.531 --> 02:44:52.965
I never thought this would happen.

02:44:56.937 --> 02:44:59.030
What do I do now?

02:45:00.007 --> 02:45:02.475
Next year, I won't even have my kids.

02:45:02.876 --> 02:45:05.174
You think you should stay with them?

02:45:06.046 --> 02:45:08.344
Or is it better they move on?

02:45:08.682 --> 02:45:10.149
I don't know.

02:45:13.954 --> 02:45:16.422
It's just a job, like you said.

02:45:16.523 --> 02:45:18.150
Yeah, it is.

02:45:19.092 --> 02:45:21.060
But is the job finished?

02:45:23.397 --> 02:45:24.989
Listen to me now.

02:45:25.265 --> 02:45:27.790
What you've done with those kids...

02:45:30.204 --> 02:45:32.502
I don't even have words for it.

02:45:34.241 --> 02:45:39.201
But one thing's for sure,
you are an amazing teacher.

02:45:41.081 --> 02:45:42.446
Special.

02:45:43.217 --> 02:45:47.620
You have been blessed with a burden,
my daughter.

02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:51.558
And I envy you that.

02:45:54.261 --> 02:45:55.888
And I admire you.

02:45:58.398 --> 02:46:02.391
And how many fathers ever get
to say that to their daughters

02:46:02.536 --> 02:46:04.504
And really mean it?

02:46:08.375 --> 02:46:11.469
What she is suggesting
is in violation of our union charter.

02:46:11.578 --> 02:46:14.741
She may not move on with her students
to teach them junior year.

02:46:14.848 --> 02:46:16.839
She's only been here two years.

02:46:16.950 --> 02:46:19.043
There are teachers here
who have tenure,

02:46:19.152 --> 02:46:21.416
Who have worked and committed
themselves for far longer

02:46:21.521 --> 02:46:23.421
To attain a position of seniority.

02:46:23.523 --> 02:46:27.482
Not to mention their experience
in teaching students of a higher caliber.

02:46:27.594 --> 02:46:30.392
The Distinguished Scholars Program
is under our jurisdiction.

02:46:30.564 --> 02:46:33.328
I don't want to replace
the Distinguished Scholars Program.

02:46:33.467 --> 02:46:35.367
I just want to stay
with my kids next year.

02:46:35.469 --> 02:46:37.664
She can't. I have the juniors.

02:46:37.738 --> 02:46:39.763
The Board of Education
will not allow this.

02:46:39.906 --> 02:46:41.840
Teaching rotations will be disrupted,

02:46:41.942 --> 02:46:44.240
Retirement schedules
will be reevaluated,

02:46:44.344 --> 02:46:47.780
Disrespecting teachers
who have earned their way far longer

02:46:47.881 --> 02:46:50.042
And who focus on the classroom,

02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:52.983
Not on public relations
and newspaper articles.

02:46:53.086 --> 02:46:55.077
I didn't ask for those articles
to be written.

02:46:55.188 --> 02:46:56.678
She's in the middle of a divorce.

02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:59.281
Note, they stay late in her class,
they're eating, they're playing games!

02:46:59.393 --> 02:47:02.487
All right, let's all just take a breath here.
All right?

02:47:03.930 --> 02:47:06.023
Now I had hoped
that we could talk this out,

02:47:06.166 --> 02:47:07.861
Maybe come to some kind
of arrangement.

02:47:08.001 --> 02:47:10.469
- There is no arrangement...
- Margaret.

02:47:11.338 --> 02:47:12.805
Carl, look.

02:47:13.407 --> 02:47:16.467
Putting aside all obvious resentments
for the moment,

02:47:16.576 --> 02:47:17.975
Even if an arrangement were made

02:47:18.078 --> 02:47:22.208
And she could teach them as juniors,
there isn't an accredited course

02:47:22.316 --> 02:47:24.682
In the curriculum for her to teach.

02:47:25.319 --> 02:47:28.982
Unless Brian trades one of his
junior classes for a sophomore.

02:47:29.089 --> 02:47:30.147
No.

02:47:31.925 --> 02:47:34.155
Then there's nothing I can do.

02:47:37.698 --> 02:47:38.995
So that's it?

02:47:40.133 --> 02:47:41.600
Believe it or not, Ms. Gruwell,

02:47:41.702 --> 02:47:44.432
There are other capable teachers
in this school.

02:47:44.571 --> 02:47:46.562
If you've made the progress
you say you have,

02:47:46.707 --> 02:47:48.368
Your students should be ready
to move on.

02:47:48.475 --> 02:47:51.137
They might even gain something
from more experienced teachers.

02:47:51.244 --> 02:47:54.509
You can't teach them.
You don't even like them.

02:47:54.614 --> 02:47:56.445
What does that have to do
with teaching?

02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:59.144
I've been an educator for over 30 years.

02:47:59.553 --> 02:48:01.248
I have students that still remain
in touch with me.

02:48:01.355 --> 02:48:03.789
I know what it is to be loved
by a classroom!

02:48:03.890 --> 02:48:06.859
You have no idea
how many battles I've had

02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:08.621
Fighting to be a better teacher,

02:48:08.729 --> 02:48:12.096
And now, what, suddenly I'm incapable
of educating your students?

02:48:12.199 --> 02:48:14.861
You know, if they move on
to our classes and they fail,

02:48:15.001 --> 02:48:17.060
It'll be because they weren't prepared!

02:48:17.204 --> 02:48:19.900
Lt'll be because you failed, not them!

02:48:38.492 --> 02:48:41.154
Andre? Wait a minute before you go in.

02:48:54.408 --> 02:48:56.876
I heard about your brother's conviction.
I'm sorry.

02:48:57.010 --> 02:48:59.205
Is that why you've missed class
so much?

02:48:59.312 --> 02:49:01.109
I had things to do.

02:49:04.384 --> 02:49:06.181
About this.

02:49:06.653 --> 02:49:07.813
The evaluation assignment

02:49:07.921 --> 02:49:09.388
Was to grade yourself
on the work you're doing.

02:49:09.489 --> 02:49:11.923
You gave yourself an F.
What's that about?

02:49:12.325 --> 02:49:15.522
- It's what I feel I deserve. That's all.
- Oh, really?

02:49:17.097 --> 02:49:18.792
You know what this is?

02:49:19.099 --> 02:49:23.092
This is a "Fuck you" to me,
and everyone in this class!

02:49:23.236 --> 02:49:26.501
I don't want excuses.
I know what you're up against.

02:49:26.840 --> 02:49:29.070
We're all of us up against something.

02:49:30.043 --> 02:49:33.410
So you better make up your mind,
because until you have the balls

02:49:33.513 --> 02:49:36.311
To look me straight in the eye
and tell me this is all you deserve,

02:49:36.416 --> 02:49:37.974
I am not letting you fail,

02:49:38.018 --> 02:49:40.077
Even if that means coming
to your house every night

02:49:40.187 --> 02:49:41.882
Until you finish the work.

02:49:41.988 --> 02:49:43.785
I see who you are.

02:49:44.324 --> 02:49:46.451
Do you understand me?

02:49:47.461 --> 02:49:49.429
I can see you.

02:49:51.298 --> 02:49:53.232
And you are not failing.

02:49:56.670 --> 02:50:01.607
So, take a minute.
Pull yourself together and come inside.

02:50:02.142 --> 02:50:04.167
I want a new evaluation.

02:50:09.382 --> 02:50:12.180
An F. What, are you tripping?

02:50:17.858 --> 02:50:21.316
I want you all to know that
Dr. Cohn and I tried very hard.

02:50:24.097 --> 02:50:26.964
But it's been decided we can't continue
with each other junior year.

02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:28.192
- What?
- What?

02:50:29.836 --> 02:50:31.736
You... Wait.

02:50:32.472 --> 02:50:34.440
Wait. Guys. Everyone.

02:50:35.842 --> 02:50:38.310
No! That don't fly, Ma!

02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:43.543
Look, first of all,
I'm not anyone's mother in here, okay?

02:50:43.650 --> 02:50:45.845
No, it doesn't mean mother.

02:50:46.553 --> 02:50:48.885
It's a sign of respect for you.

02:51:03.103 --> 02:51:04.502
Listen to me.

02:51:04.738 --> 02:51:06.035
All of you.

02:51:06.806 --> 02:51:11.436
Don't use me as another excuse
for why you can't make it.

02:51:13.346 --> 02:51:16.645
You made it to your junior year.

02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:20.248
Think about how you did that.

02:51:21.621 --> 02:51:25.284
Everyone in this room
has a chance to graduate.

02:51:26.326 --> 02:51:28.886
For some,
you'll be the first in your family.

02:51:28.995 --> 02:51:31.759
The first with a choice to go to college.

02:51:32.766 --> 02:51:35.564
Some may move faster than others.

02:51:37.170 --> 02:51:39.468
But you'll each have the chance.

02:51:40.540 --> 02:51:43.509
And you did that. Not me.

02:51:50.584 --> 02:51:54.247
Now, I have one

02:51:56.289 --> 02:51:57.881
Final project in mind.

02:51:57.991 --> 02:52:00.186
- Ms. G.
- Yeah?

02:52:02.028 --> 02:52:06.988
<i>Ms. G wanted us to put our diaries
together in a book, just like Anne Frank.</i>

02:52:07.734 --> 02:52:09.759
<i>She got this businessman, John Tu,</i>

02:52:09.903 --> 02:52:12.736
<i>to donate 35 computers
so we could work.</i>

02:52:17.811 --> 02:52:21.212
<i>She told us we have something
to say to people.</i>

02:52:21.381 --> 02:52:22.580
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

02:52:22.615 --> 02:52:23.779
<i>We weren't just kids
in a class anymore.</i>

02:52:23.883 --> 02:52:27.580
<i>We were writers with our own voices,
our own stories.</i>

02:52:27.687 --> 02:52:29.746
<i>And even if nobody else read it,</i>

02:52:29.856 --> 02:52:33.451
<i>the book would be something
to leave behind that said we were here,</i>

02:52:34.060 --> 02:52:37.154
<i>this is what happened, we mattered.</i>

02:52:37.631 --> 02:52:41.897
<i>Even if it was just to each other.
And we won't forget.</i>

02:52:43.603 --> 02:52:45.969
<i>Ms. G didn't promise
it would get published or anything,</i>

02:52:46.072 --> 02:52:48.939
<i>but we could get it out there ourselves.</i>

02:52:49.676 --> 02:52:51.906
<i>She asked us to come up with a title,</i>

02:52:52.445 --> 02:52:54.413
<i>something to call ourselves.</i>

02:53:12.198 --> 02:53:14.063
I just received a call
from Karin Polacheck

02:53:14.200 --> 02:53:15.292
At the Board of Education.

02:53:15.435 --> 02:53:17.426
There's to be a meeting
with Dr. Cohn about your classes.

02:53:17.570 --> 02:53:21.006
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

02:53:28.815 --> 02:53:34.276
These students, this class,
they've become a family.

02:53:35.188 --> 02:53:36.780
To who? To you?

02:53:37.457 --> 02:53:39.084
To each other.

02:53:39.893 --> 02:53:43.226
Room 203 is a kind of a home for them.

02:53:43.763 --> 02:53:47.096
Their trust is all wrapped up
in us being together as a group.

02:53:47.534 --> 02:53:48.660
Once they're out of her class,

02:53:48.802 --> 02:53:51.236
Believe me they'll slip back
into their old habits.

02:53:51.337 --> 02:53:55.296
Their reading scores, their writing
has markedly improved, Ms. Campbell.

02:53:55.442 --> 02:53:58.934
On paper. But what has
she accomplished in reality?

02:53:59.045 --> 02:54:00.672
What about new students
that come in next year?

02:54:00.780 --> 02:54:02.771
Can she repeat
this process every year?

02:54:02.882 --> 02:54:04.281
Her methods are impractical,

02:54:04.384 --> 02:54:07.012
Impossible to implement with regularity.

02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:09.611
What if every teacher
performed in this way?

02:54:10.223 --> 02:54:11.451
We have millions of children

02:54:11.558 --> 02:54:13.287
To get through the education system
in this country,

02:54:13.393 --> 02:54:15.224
And we need a means
of accomplishing that

02:54:15.328 --> 02:54:18.229
Which allows as many students
to benefit as possible,

02:54:18.331 --> 02:54:20.265
Not just special cases.

02:54:21.768 --> 02:54:25.226
And you honestly think you can create
this family in every classroom,

02:54:25.371 --> 02:54:28.340
For every grade,
for every student you teach?

02:54:32.912 --> 02:54:34.379
I don't know.

02:54:40.587 --> 02:54:41.918
Thank you.

02:55:02.308 --> 02:55:05.209
Hey, there go Ms. G.
Hey, there go Ms. G!

02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:15.519
What happened?

02:55:16.322 --> 02:55:20.122
So? Are we gonna be together
for junior year?

02:55:25.965 --> 02:55:27.262
No.

02:55:28.201 --> 02:55:30.066
- What?
- What?

02:55:34.674 --> 02:55:38.041
We're gonna be together junior
and senior year.

02:55:39.479 --> 02:55:40.537
Yes!
