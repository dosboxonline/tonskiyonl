I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

03:47.213 --> 03:48.505
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

03:48.589 --> 03:49.673
Yeah.

03:49.882 --> 03:50.966
Shep Proudfoot said...

03:51.050 --> 03:54.219
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

03:54.387 --> 03:56.054
Shep said 8:30.

03:56.138 --> 03:57.324
We've been sitting here an hour.

03:57.390 --> 03:59.057
He's peed three times already.

03:59.141 --> 04:02.143
I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.

04:02.353 --> 04:04.396
It was a mix-up, I guess.

04:04.730 --> 04:05.730
You got the car?

04:05.857 --> 04:07.065
Yeah. You bet.

04:07.149 --> 04:09.776
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

04:09.861 --> 04:12.320
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

04:13.197 --> 04:14.239
I'm Carl Showalter.

04:14.323 --> 04:16.533
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

04:16.617 --> 04:18.034
Yeah. How you doing?

04:18.119 --> 04:20.579
So, we all set on this thing, then?

04:20.663 --> 04:22.455
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

04:22.540 --> 04:23.915
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.333
Shep vouched for you and all.

04:25.418 --> 04:28.253
I got every confidence here
in you fellas.

04:33.175 --> 04:35.218
I guess that's it, then.

04:35.303 --> 04:36.344
Here are the keys.

04:36.429 --> 04:37.721
No, that's not it, Jerry.

04:37.805 --> 04:38.847
Huh?

04:38.931 --> 04:41.308
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

04:41.392 --> 04:43.977
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

04:44.061 --> 04:47.355
then the 40,000,
like as if it was the ransom.

04:47.440 --> 04:48.523
I thought Shep told you.

04:48.608 --> 04:50.150
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

04:50.234 --> 04:51.276
Well, okay...

04:51.360 --> 04:53.528
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.

04:53.613 --> 04:55.196
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

04:55.281 --> 04:56.781
Yeah, you already said that.

04:56.866 --> 05:00.452
Yeah, but it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

05:00.536 --> 05:04.706
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

05:04.790 --> 05:06.291
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

05:06.375 --> 05:07.375
Okay.

05:07.460 --> 05:09.544
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

05:09.629 --> 05:10.670
I will say this, though.

05:10.755 --> 05:13.423
What Shep told us
didn't make a whole lot of sense.

05:13.507 --> 05:16.551
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.220
You want your own wife kidnapped.

05:19.305 --> 05:20.347
Yeah.

05:22.183 --> 05:23.391
You...

05:23.935 --> 05:25.352
My point is,

05:25.811 --> 05:28.271
you pay the ransom, what,
80,000 bucks?

05:28.356 --> 05:32.233
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

05:32.318 --> 05:33.652
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

05:33.694 --> 05:34.903
It doesn't make any sense.

05:34.987 --> 05:38.198
Okay, see, it's not me paying the ransom.

05:38.491 --> 05:41.159
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

05:41.243 --> 05:42.953
Her dad, he's real well-off.

05:43.037 --> 05:44.412
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

05:44.497 --> 05:45.956
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

05:46.040 --> 05:49.793
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

05:49.877 --> 05:51.294
See, I just need the money.

05:51.379 --> 05:53.505
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

05:53.589 --> 05:55.298
So, why don't you just ask him
for the money?

05:55.383 --> 05:56.758
Or your fucking wife, you know?

05:56.842 --> 05:58.259
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

05:58.344 --> 05:59.552
Well...

06:00.346 --> 06:02.389
It's all part of this...

06:04.350 --> 06:06.059
They don't know I need it, see?

06:06.143 --> 06:09.354
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

06:09.438 --> 06:10.939
so there's that on top, then.

06:11.023 --> 06:12.273
See, these are personal matters.

06:12.358 --> 06:13.358
Personal matters?

06:13.442 --> 06:16.361
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

06:16.612 --> 06:18.363
Okay, Jerry.

06:18.447 --> 06:22.450
You're tasking us to perform this mission,
but you won't...

06:22.535 --> 06:24.035
You won't...

06:26.372 --> 06:28.832
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

06:36.882 --> 06:38.049
Hon?

06:38.592 --> 06:40.802
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

06:41.220 --> 06:42.721
How was Fargo?

06:42.805 --> 06:44.472
Yeah, real good.

06:44.724 --> 06:46.224
Dad's here.

06:48.894 --> 06:51.771
<i>...leads the Badgers in goal production
with five this year.</i>

06:51.981 --> 06:52.981
How you doing, Wade?

06:53.065 --> 06:54.149
Yeah, pretty good.

06:54.233 --> 06:55.233
What you watching there?

06:55.317 --> 06:56.359
Gophers.

06:56.444 --> 06:57.819
Who they playing?

06:57.903 --> 06:58.945
Ooh!

07:05.619 --> 07:07.287
Is he staying for supper, then?

07:07.371 --> 07:09.080
Yeah. I think so.

07:09.623 --> 07:10.790
- Dad?
- What?

07:10.875 --> 07:12.167
Are you staying for supper?

07:12.251 --> 07:13.376
Yeah.

07:20.551 --> 07:22.093
May I be excused?

07:22.178 --> 07:23.178
You done there?

07:23.262 --> 07:24.679
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

07:24.764 --> 07:26.514
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

07:26.599 --> 07:27.766
Just McDonald's.

07:27.850 --> 07:29.517
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

07:30.561 --> 07:32.353
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

07:32.438 --> 07:35.023
Going to McDonald's
instead of finishing here.

07:35.107 --> 07:36.608
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

07:36.692 --> 07:38.359
It's okay, McDonald's?

07:38.444 --> 07:40.236
What do you think they do there?

07:40.321 --> 07:42.363
They don't drink milk shakes,
I assure you.

07:42.448 --> 07:43.948
It's okay, Dad.

07:50.456 --> 07:53.374
Wade, have you had a chance
to think about

07:53.459 --> 07:54.959
that deal I was talking about,

07:55.044 --> 07:56.711
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

07:56.796 --> 07:58.213
You told me about it.

07:58.297 --> 08:00.215
Yeah, you said you'd have
to think about it.

08:00.299 --> 08:01.716
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

08:01.801 --> 08:04.719
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you say you were gonna put there?

08:04.804 --> 08:06.096
A lot. It's a...

08:06.180 --> 08:07.639
I know it's a lot.

08:07.723 --> 08:08.890
I mean a parking lot.

08:08.974 --> 08:11.976
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

08:12.686 --> 08:13.895
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

08:13.979 --> 08:17.023
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

08:17.108 --> 08:18.733
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

08:18.818 --> 08:20.985
I thought you were gonna show it
to Stan Grossman.

08:21.070 --> 08:23.321
He passes on this stuff
before it gets kicked up to me.

08:23.405 --> 08:25.949
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

08:26.033 --> 08:28.034
I'm asking you here, Wade.

08:28.786 --> 08:32.330
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

08:32.664 --> 08:35.207
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

08:50.057 --> 08:52.016
Where is Pancakes House?

08:53.269 --> 08:54.269
What?

08:54.353 --> 08:56.479
We stop at Pancakes House.

08:57.898 --> 09:00.275
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

09:00.359 --> 09:01.943
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

09:02.027 --> 09:03.611
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

09:03.696 --> 09:06.114
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.121
Oh, come on, man.

09:14.582 --> 09:16.457
Okay. Here's an idea.

09:17.001 --> 09:18.209
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

09:18.294 --> 09:20.628
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

09:20.713 --> 09:22.630
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

09:22.715 --> 09:26.384
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

09:26.468 --> 09:28.887
and then we'll get laid, all right?

09:37.229 --> 09:39.147
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

09:41.859 --> 09:43.234
We sat right here in this room

09:43.319 --> 09:44.777
and went over this and over this.

09:44.862 --> 09:45.904
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

09:45.988 --> 09:48.907
I sat right here and said
I didn't want any TruCoat.

09:48.991 --> 09:50.992
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

09:51.076 --> 09:53.077
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

09:53.162 --> 09:54.662
It'll cost you a heck
of a lot more than $500.

09:54.747 --> 09:55.830
You're sitting there.

09:55.915 --> 09:56.956
You're talking in circles.

09:57.041 --> 09:58.893
You're talking like
we didn't go over this already.

09:58.959 --> 10:00.043
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

10:00.127 --> 10:02.253
We had a deal here for 19,500.

10:02.338 --> 10:04.047
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

10:04.131 --> 10:05.840
you'd get me this car,
these options,

10:05.925 --> 10:07.842
without the sealant, for 19,500.

10:07.927 --> 10:09.385
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

10:09.470 --> 10:11.012
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

10:11.096 --> 10:12.805
you had it ready to make delivery.

10:12.890 --> 10:14.515
You says,
"Come on down and get it."

10:14.600 --> 10:18.728
And here you are, and you're wasting
my time and my wife's time,

10:18.812 --> 10:21.731
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

10:22.441 --> 10:23.816
All right.

10:24.568 --> 10:26.444
I'll talk to my boss.

10:29.615 --> 10:31.908
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory.

10:31.992 --> 10:35.411
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

10:36.622 --> 10:38.748
These guys here.
These guys.

10:40.084 --> 10:42.627
It's always the same.
It's always more.

10:47.007 --> 10:48.591
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

10:48.676 --> 10:50.176
Oh, you betcha.

10:50.261 --> 10:52.637
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

10:53.639 --> 10:55.098
You kidding?

10:56.976 --> 10:58.017
Well...

11:00.896 --> 11:02.563
he never done this before,

11:02.648 --> 11:05.400
but seeing as
it's special circumstances and all,

11:05.484 --> 11:08.403
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

11:10.155 --> 11:11.531
100?

11:12.324 --> 11:14.575
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.411
You're a bald-faced liar.

11:16.495 --> 11:18.121
Bucky, please.

11:18.205 --> 11:20.790
A fucking liar.

11:20.874 --> 11:22.375
Bucky, please.

11:23.335 --> 11:25.003
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

11:25.087 --> 11:26.713
Let's get this over with.

11:27.965 --> 11:29.340
Where is it?

12:04.376 --> 12:08.546
<i>From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...</i>

12:10.549 --> 12:12.967
I am talking about your potential.

12:13.052 --> 12:14.052
Mmm-hmm.

12:14.636 --> 12:16.763
You're not a C student.

12:16.972 --> 12:18.181
Yeah.

12:18.474 --> 12:20.600
Yet you're getting C grades.

12:21.018 --> 12:23.978
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

12:24.063 --> 12:25.063
Uh-huh.

12:25.814 --> 12:27.482
You know what a disparity is?

12:27.566 --> 12:28.608
Yeah!

12:28.692 --> 12:30.818
Okay! Well, that's why we...

12:30.903 --> 12:33.196
We don't want you going out for hockey.

12:33.280 --> 12:34.614
Oh, man!

12:34.698 --> 12:36.616
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

12:36.742 --> 12:38.493
Hold on.

12:38.577 --> 12:39.827
What's the big deal?

12:39.912 --> 12:40.995
Hello?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.872
<i>- Yeah, hiya, hon.</i>
- Oh, hi, Dad.

12:42.956 --> 12:44.040
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

12:44.124 --> 12:46.000
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

12:46.085 --> 12:47.335
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

12:47.419 --> 12:48.544
- Hon!
- Yeah?

12:48.629 --> 12:50.213
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

12:50.297 --> 12:52.256
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

12:52.341 --> 12:53.341
Scotty!

12:53.425 --> 12:55.760
Hey, let's watch that language there.

12:55.844 --> 12:57.011
How you doing there, Wade?

12:57.096 --> 12:58.179
<i>What's going on there?</i>

12:58.263 --> 13:00.640
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

13:00.724 --> 13:02.767
<i>Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.</i>

13:02.851 --> 13:04.143
<i>He says it's pretty sweet.</i>

No kidding?

13:05.312 --> 13:06.521
<i>Might be interested.</i>

13:07.022 --> 13:10.942
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

13:11.026 --> 13:12.527
in order to close the deal.

13:12.611 --> 13:14.237
<i>Come by at 2:30.

<i>If your numbers are right,
Stan says it's pretty sweet.</i>

13:17.449 --> 13:19.283
<i>- Stan, you know, Grossman.</i>
- Yeah.

13:19.368 --> 13:20.368
<i>2:30.</i>

13:20.452 --> 13:21.577
Yeah. Okay.

13:36.260 --> 13:38.219
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

13:38.303 --> 13:40.221
Say, you know those two fellas

13:40.305 --> 13:41.973
you put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

13:42.057 --> 13:43.724
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

13:43.809 --> 13:45.518
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

13:45.602 --> 13:46.788
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

13:46.854 --> 13:47.937
Well, that's okay.

13:48.021 --> 13:50.231
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

13:50.315 --> 13:51.899
Carl something.

13:51.984 --> 13:53.429
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

13:53.485 --> 13:56.446
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

13:56.530 --> 13:57.947
so I'm not worried. I just...

13:58.031 --> 14:00.450
I was wondering, see,
I got to get in touch with him.

14:00.534 --> 14:04.454
See, this deal I needed him for,
I may not need it anymore.

14:04.538 --> 14:06.497
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

14:06.582 --> 14:10.001
Yeah, well, see, I did that,
and I haven't been able to get him,

14:10.085 --> 14:13.254
so I thought maybe you'd know
an alternate number, or what have you.

14:13.338 --> 14:14.338
Nope.

14:14.423 --> 14:16.257
Okay. Well...

14:16.341 --> 14:17.842
Real good, then.

14:37.821 --> 14:40.531
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

14:42.367 --> 14:46.370
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

14:46.455 --> 14:48.456
You know, a cancer agent.

14:50.167 --> 14:52.376
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

14:52.461 --> 14:54.045
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

14:54.129 --> 14:59.175
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest
after the Sears in Chicago,

14:59.259 --> 15:01.886
or John Hancock building, whatever.

15:01.970 --> 15:04.514
You ever been to Minneapolis?

15:04.598 --> 15:05.723
No.

15:08.352 --> 15:10.811
Would it kill you to say something?

15:11.438 --> 15:12.647
I did.

15:13.065 --> 15:17.068
"No." That's the first thing you've said
in the last four hours.

15:17.569 --> 15:18.903
That's a...

15:18.987 --> 15:21.572
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

15:21.657 --> 15:23.324
That's a geyser.

15:23.408 --> 15:26.202
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

15:27.663 --> 15:29.163
Shit.

15:29.248 --> 15:30.998
I'm sitting here driving.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.458
I'm doing all the driving, man,

15:32.543 --> 15:34.252
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

15:34.336 --> 15:37.046
Just trying to chat.

15:37.297 --> 15:39.715
You know, keep our spirits up,

15:39.800 --> 15:40.912
fight the boredom of the road,

15:40.968 --> 15:45.137
and you can't say one fucking thing
just in the way of conversation?

15:46.557 --> 15:49.267
Oh, fuck it.
I don't have to talk either, man.

15:49.351 --> 15:51.143
See how you like it.

15:54.982 --> 15:56.941
Just total fucking silence.

15:57.025 --> 15:59.402
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

15:59.486 --> 16:01.779
We'll just see how you like it.

16:04.283 --> 16:05.825
Total silence.

16:08.245 --> 16:11.497
<i>Mr. Lundegaard,
this is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

16:11.582 --> 16:12.707
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

16:12.791 --> 16:14.083
Real good. How you doing?

16:14.167 --> 16:15.585
<i>Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

16:15.669 --> 16:17.712
<i>You're damn hard to get
on the phone.</i>

16:17.796 --> 16:20.214
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

16:20.299 --> 16:21.340
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

16:21.425 --> 16:23.342
<i>Now, I just need on these last,</i>

16:23.427 --> 16:25.469
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

16:25.554 --> 16:27.722
<i>I can't read the serial numbers
of the vehicles.</i>

16:27.806 --> 16:29.098
Yeah, but I already got the...

16:29.182 --> 16:30.600
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

16:30.684 --> 16:32.435
I already got the...
What? The...

16:32.519 --> 16:33.769
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

16:33.854 --> 16:35.313
<i>You got the money last month.</i>

16:35.397 --> 16:36.772
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

16:36.857 --> 16:39.066
<i>Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,</i>

16:39.151 --> 16:42.069
<i>I just can't read the serial numbers
on your application.</i>

16:42.154 --> 16:43.321
<i>Maybe if you could just read...</i>

16:43.405 --> 16:44.447
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

16:44.531 --> 16:45.656
I already got the money.

16:45.741 --> 16:47.199
<i>Yes, but if we have an audit here,</i>

16:47.284 --> 16:48.659
<i>I just have to know that these vehicles</i>

16:48.744 --> 16:50.077
<i>you're financing with this money,</i>

16:50.162 --> 16:51.454
<i>that they really exist.</i>

16:51.538 --> 16:53.748
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

16:53.832 --> 16:55.499
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

16:55.584 --> 16:58.961
<i>but I can't read the serial numbers here,
so if you could read me...</i>

16:59.046 --> 17:02.006
Yeah, but... See...

17:02.591 --> 17:03.883
I don't have them in front of me.

17:03.967 --> 17:05.425
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

17:05.510 --> 17:07.094
<i>No, well, no, fax is no good.</i>

17:07.179 --> 17:09.180
<i>That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.</i>

17:09.263 --> 17:12.016
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

17:12.099 --> 17:15.435
<i>Okay, because if I can't correlate this note
with the specific vehicles,</i>

17:15.520 --> 17:17.563
<i>then I got to call back that money.</i>

17:17.647 --> 17:19.022
Yeah, how much money was that?

17:19.107 --> 17:22.026
<i>320,000.
I got to correlate that money</i>

17:22.109 --> 17:23.569
<i>with the cars it's being lent on.</i>

17:23.654 --> 17:25.780
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

17:25.864 --> 17:26.864
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

17:26.906 --> 17:28.699
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

17:28.784 --> 17:29.909
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

17:29.993 --> 17:31.869
Okay. Real good, then.

17:38.377 --> 17:40.211
<i>- We're back with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.</i>

17:40.295 --> 17:41.337
<i>Now, before we get going here,</i>

17:41.421 --> 17:43.422
<i>we just want to remind
all of our viewers at home</i>

17:43.507 --> 17:45.591
<i>that this March,
for the second year in a row,</i>

17:45.676 --> 17:47.968
<i>Katie and I,
along with Twin City Travel,</i>

17:48.053 --> 17:50.638
<i>will be leading a two-week riverboat trip
down the Nile.</i>

17:50.722 --> 17:52.515
<i>It's a terrific time.
I know you've heard about it.</i>

17:52.599 --> 17:55.851
<i>We want all of you to come with...</i>

17:56.353 --> 17:57.561
<i>and that's the truth.</i>

17:59.189 --> 18:01.273
<i>Okay, now, for those of you
that just joined us,</i>

18:01.358 --> 18:02.817
<i>Katie here, this morning,
is going to show us</i>

18:02.901 --> 18:05.986
<i>how to make Holidazzle eggs ourselves,
at home.</i>

18:06.071 --> 18:07.905
<i>- Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?</i>

18:07.989 --> 18:10.491
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

18:10.575 --> 18:11.575
<i>Right.</i>

18:11.618 --> 18:12.660
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

18:12.744 --> 18:13.953
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

18:14.037 --> 18:15.037
<i>Well, how do you get the egg...</i>

18:15.080 --> 18:16.330
<i>- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.</i>

18:16.415 --> 18:19.250
<i>Okay, well, I don't...
How do you... I mean, you don't have</i>

18:19.334 --> 18:22.294
<i>an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?</i>

18:22.379 --> 18:23.421
<i>No, no.</i>

18:23.755 --> 18:26.090
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

18:41.356 --> 18:42.356
Unguent.

18:42.441 --> 18:43.441
What?

18:43.525 --> 18:45.276
I need unguent.

18:51.658 --> 18:52.867
No.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.001
No...

19:25.275 --> 19:26.484
You want to do it?

19:26.568 --> 19:27.777
Push.

20:27.546 --> 20:29.797
- How are you, Stan?
- How you doing, Wade?

20:29.881 --> 20:31.799
Good to see you again, Jerry.

20:31.925 --> 20:34.468
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

20:34.553 --> 20:35.970
Those numbers are right, all right.

20:36.054 --> 20:37.096
Believe me.

20:37.180 --> 20:38.305
This is doable.

20:38.390 --> 20:39.640
Congratulations, Jer.

20:39.724 --> 20:41.600
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

20:41.685 --> 20:44.770
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

20:45.564 --> 20:46.605
Huh?

20:47.065 --> 20:49.400
The financials are pretty thorough,

20:49.484 --> 20:52.361
so the only thing we don't know
is your fee.

20:52.445 --> 20:53.821
My fee?

20:54.531 --> 20:56.490
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

20:56.575 --> 20:57.950
Stan and I are okay.

20:58.034 --> 20:59.869
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

20:59.953 --> 21:01.370
Yeah.

21:01.454 --> 21:05.082
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.501
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

21:07.586 --> 21:09.031
for you to loan me the money to put in.

21:09.087 --> 21:10.963
It's my deal here, see.

21:13.008 --> 21:15.301
Jerry, we thought you were bringing us
an investment.

21:15.385 --> 21:16.594
Yeah. Right.

21:16.928 --> 21:18.554
You're saying...

21:19.222 --> 21:20.222
What are you saying?

21:20.307 --> 21:21.557
You're saying we put in all the money,

21:21.641 --> 21:23.058
and you collect when it pays off.

21:25.478 --> 21:27.646
No, no. See...
But I'd...

21:27.731 --> 21:30.357
I'd pay you back the principal and interest.

21:30.442 --> 21:33.110
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

21:33.445 --> 21:34.612
We're not a bank, Jerry.

21:34.696 --> 21:36.739
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

21:36.823 --> 21:39.825
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

21:39.910 --> 21:41.243
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

21:41.328 --> 21:43.287
No, no. See, I...

21:44.289 --> 21:47.166
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

21:47.834 --> 21:49.793
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

21:49.878 --> 21:51.337
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

21:51.421 --> 21:52.546
I need the principal.

21:52.631 --> 21:55.883
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna
just give you $750,000.

21:55.967 --> 21:57.384
What the heck were you thinking?

21:57.469 --> 21:58.761
If I'm only getting bank interest,

21:58.845 --> 22:01.639
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

22:01.723 --> 22:03.182
I don't see nothing like that here.

22:03.266 --> 22:04.808
Yeah, but I...

22:07.479 --> 22:08.896
Okay. I...

22:08.980 --> 22:10.731
I guarantee you your money back.

22:10.815 --> 22:14.026
I'm not talking
about your damn word, Jerry.

22:14.110 --> 22:15.319
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

22:15.403 --> 22:17.112
We're not a bank, Jerry.

22:17.656 --> 22:20.157
Well, look. I don't want
to cut you out of the loop,

22:20.241 --> 22:22.618
but this here's a good deal.

22:22.827 --> 22:25.037
I assume, if you're not interested,

22:25.121 --> 22:28.499
you won't mind
if we move on it independently.

23:29.519 --> 23:30.728
Damn it!

24:02.093 --> 24:03.218
Hon?

24:05.889 --> 24:07.681
I got the groceries!

24:44.260 --> 24:47.638
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

24:49.891 --> 24:53.644
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

24:53.728 --> 24:56.355
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

24:56.439 --> 24:58.899
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

25:00.944 --> 25:04.113
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

25:06.282 --> 25:08.909
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

25:08.993 --> 25:11.912
It's something... Jeez.
It's terrible.

25:22.257 --> 25:24.383
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

26:00.253 --> 26:02.337
Shut the fuck up,

26:02.422 --> 26:05.048
or I'll throw you back into the trunk,
you know.

26:05.133 --> 26:08.385
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

26:16.060 --> 26:18.020
Shit.

26:20.356 --> 26:21.857
Oh, the tags.

26:27.197 --> 26:29.573
All right, it's just the tags.

26:29.657 --> 26:31.909
I never put my tags on the car.

26:33.912 --> 26:36.955
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

27:00.521 --> 27:02.225
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

27:02.273 --> 27:05.734
or else we're gonna have to,
you know, to shoot you.

27:13.743 --> 27:16.036
Hey, I'll take care of this.

27:39.352 --> 27:41.478
How can I help you, Officer?

27:51.281 --> 27:52.948
This is a new car, then, sir?

27:53.032 --> 27:56.034
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

27:57.161 --> 27:59.579
You're required to display
temporary tags,

27:59.664 --> 28:02.291
either in the plate area or taped
to the inside of the back window.

28:02.375 --> 28:03.417
Certainly.

28:03.501 --> 28:05.877
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

28:05.962 --> 28:07.337
Certainly.

28:10.258 --> 28:13.218
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

28:13.678 --> 28:17.931
You know, to be in full compliance,
but it must have...

28:18.016 --> 28:20.100
It must have slipped my mind.

28:21.519 --> 28:22.811
So maybe the best thing to do would be

28:22.895 --> 28:25.355
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

28:26.858 --> 28:28.567
What's this, sir?

28:29.277 --> 28:31.445
My license and registration.

28:32.530 --> 28:34.906
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

28:36.743 --> 28:39.453
I was just thinking we could take care
of it right here,

28:39.537 --> 28:40.996
in Brainerd.

28:46.836 --> 28:50.005
Put that back in your pocket, please,

28:50.089 --> 28:52.674
and step out of the car,
please, sir.

29:16.699 --> 29:18.325
Shut the fuck up.

29:35.843 --> 29:36.968
Whoa.

29:38.846 --> 29:40.305
Whoa, daddy.

29:42.934 --> 29:45.268
You'll take care of it.

29:49.107 --> 29:51.525
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

29:53.277 --> 29:54.986
Oh, daddy.

29:56.948 --> 29:58.990
Just clear him off the road.

29:59.909 --> 30:01.034
Yeah.

31:55.066 --> 31:56.274
No!

33:52.683 --> 33:53.975
Oh, jeez.

33:59.815 --> 34:01.316
Hi. It's Marge.

34:03.235 --> 34:04.778
Oh, my. Where?

34:05.821 --> 34:06.946
Yeah?

34:08.366 --> 34:09.658
Oh, jeez.

34:11.911 --> 34:13.703
Okay. There in a jiff.

34:14.205 --> 34:15.830
Real good, then.

34:24.382 --> 34:26.675
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

34:27.217 --> 34:28.217
Got to go?

34:28.260 --> 34:29.427
Yeah.

34:30.346 --> 34:32.222
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:32.681 --> 34:34.849
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

34:34.934 --> 34:37.393
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

34:39.313 --> 34:41.231
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:42.274 --> 34:44.192
Hon, you can sleep.

34:44.568 --> 34:46.610
You gotta eat a breakfast.

34:50.116 --> 34:52.033
I'll fix you some eggs.

34:53.202 --> 34:54.327
Norm.

35:01.252 --> 35:03.420
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

35:04.088 --> 35:05.171
Love you, Margie.

35:05.256 --> 35:06.548
Love you, hon.

35:39.707 --> 35:40.707
Hon?

35:40.791 --> 35:41.791
Yeah?

35:41.834 --> 35:43.626
Prowler needs a jump.

36:03.397 --> 36:04.773
Hiya, Lou.

36:05.900 --> 36:08.276
What you got there?

36:08.402 --> 36:11.404
Margie, thought you might need
a little warm-up.

36:11.489 --> 36:13.239
Thanks a bunch.

36:13.324 --> 36:14.574
So what's the deal now?

36:14.658 --> 36:15.909
Gary says triple homicide?

36:15.993 --> 36:17.243
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

36:17.328 --> 36:18.953
Two of them are over here.

36:19.371 --> 36:20.914
Where is everybody?

36:20.998 --> 36:23.833
Well, it's cold, Margie.

36:26.045 --> 36:28.087
Watch your step, Margie.

36:37.890 --> 36:39.849
Jeez. So...

36:40.476 --> 36:42.143
Jeez!

36:42.228 --> 36:44.145
Here's the second one!

36:45.314 --> 36:47.941
It's in the head and the hand there.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.277
I guess that's a defensive wound.

36:51.362 --> 36:52.946
Oh, yeah?

36:53.823 --> 36:56.074
Where's the state trooper?

36:56.158 --> 36:59.828
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

37:00.079 --> 37:01.287
Okay.

37:02.122 --> 37:04.791
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

37:04.875 --> 37:06.292
We got a shooting.

37:06.377 --> 37:07.794
These folks drive by.

37:07.878 --> 37:10.463
There's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here,

37:10.548 --> 37:12.799
and then this execution-type deal.

37:12.883 --> 37:14.008
Yeah.

37:15.427 --> 37:18.471
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

37:18.556 --> 37:19.722
Yeah.

37:21.308 --> 37:23.142
And I'll tell you what.

37:23.227 --> 37:26.312
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

37:29.692 --> 37:32.360
You see something down there, Chief?

37:32.444 --> 37:35.238
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

37:35.322 --> 37:36.447
Jeez.

37:37.491 --> 37:38.992
You okay, Margie?

37:39.076 --> 37:40.660
Yeah. I'm fine.

37:43.205 --> 37:45.248
It's just morning sickness.

37:47.585 --> 37:49.252
Well, that passed.

37:49.336 --> 37:50.420
Yeah?

37:50.504 --> 37:52.130
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

37:52.798 --> 37:54.841
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

37:54.925 --> 37:56.384
Oh, yeah.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.969
Norm made some eggs.

37:58.053 --> 37:59.178
Yeah?

38:00.097 --> 38:01.222
Well...

38:02.433 --> 38:04.392
What now, do you think?

38:04.935 --> 38:06.519
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

38:09.940 --> 38:11.441
There's different footprints here, Lou.

38:11.525 --> 38:12.567
Yeah?

38:12.651 --> 38:15.320
Yeah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.

38:15.404 --> 38:16.654
Oh, yeah?

38:17.448 --> 38:19.157
For Pete's sake.

38:19.241 --> 38:20.617
How's it look, Marge?

38:21.076 --> 38:23.703
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

38:24.079 --> 38:26.623
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.708
It's a real shame.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.126
Yeah.

38:32.838 --> 38:34.589
Didn't monkey with his car there,
did you?

38:34.673 --> 38:35.757
No way.

38:35.841 --> 38:37.508
Well, somebody shut his lights.

38:37.593 --> 38:38.968
I guess the little guy sat in there

38:39.053 --> 38:40.386
waiting for his buddy to come back.

38:40.471 --> 38:42.055
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

38:42.139 --> 38:45.058
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

38:45.142 --> 38:46.309
Dave?

38:47.144 --> 38:48.811
You don't think he's mixed up in...

38:48.896 --> 38:52.231
Oh, no, no. I just want to get Norm
some night crawlers.

38:54.944 --> 38:56.945
Did you look in his citation book?

38:57.029 --> 39:02.241
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

39:02.326 --> 39:04.577
Under plate number he put "DLR."

39:04.662 --> 39:06.287
I figure they stopped him or shot him

39:06.372 --> 39:09.415
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

39:09.500 --> 39:13.002
So, I got the State looking for a Cierra
with a tag starting "DLR."

39:13.087 --> 39:15.171
They don't got no match yet.

39:16.173 --> 39:18.257
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

39:18.342 --> 39:20.343
on your police work there, Lou.

39:20.427 --> 39:21.761
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:22.346 --> 39:25.598
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

39:26.308 --> 39:27.475
"DLR."

39:29.812 --> 39:30.812
Oh.

39:32.815 --> 39:33.940
Jeez.

39:35.526 --> 39:36.943
Say, Lou...

39:37.027 --> 39:38.111
did you hear the one about the guy

39:38.195 --> 39:39.737
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

39:39.822 --> 39:43.157
so he went and changed his name
to J3L-2404?

39:44.201 --> 39:46.202
Yeah. That's a good one.

39:53.460 --> 39:57.338
<i>Look, all's I know is,
you got a problem, you call a professional.</i>

39:57.423 --> 39:59.257
No. They said no cops.

39:59.341 --> 40:01.092
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

40:01.176 --> 40:03.136
They said, "You call your cops,
and we're gonna shoot..."

40:03.220 --> 40:04.637
Of course they're gonna say that.

40:04.722 --> 40:06.764
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

40:06.849 --> 40:08.766
If I give these sons of bitches $1 million,

40:08.851 --> 40:10.643
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

40:10.728 --> 40:11.728
Well, they...

40:11.770 --> 40:12.854
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

40:12.938 --> 40:14.647
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

40:14.732 --> 40:16.232
Think this thing through here, Wade.

40:16.316 --> 40:19.235
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

40:19.319 --> 40:22.196
You got to listen to me
on this one, Wade.

40:22.281 --> 40:24.073
Heck, you don't know.

40:24.158 --> 40:26.159
You're just whistling Dixie here.

40:26.243 --> 40:28.286
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

40:28.370 --> 40:29.620
I'm saying call a professional.

40:29.705 --> 40:31.622
No. No cops.

40:32.666 --> 40:35.168
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

40:35.252 --> 40:36.252
Yeah.

40:36.336 --> 40:38.337
Jean is my wife here.

40:38.422 --> 40:41.257
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

40:41.341 --> 40:42.341
Well...

40:42.426 --> 40:44.594
We got to protect Jean.
These...

40:44.678 --> 40:46.471
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

40:46.555 --> 40:48.514
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

40:48.599 --> 40:49.682
You're darn tooting.

40:49.767 --> 40:50.850
Oh, damn it.

40:50.934 --> 40:52.143
I'm telling you.

40:52.227 --> 40:54.604
Well, why don't we...

40:55.397 --> 40:58.232
Stan, I'm thinking we should offer them
a half a million.

40:58.317 --> 40:59.734
Now, come on here!

40:59.818 --> 41:01.819
No way, Wade.
No way.

41:01.904 --> 41:03.237
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

41:03.322 --> 41:04.363
Yeah.

41:04.448 --> 41:06.115
We gotta just bite the bullet
on this thing.

41:06.200 --> 41:07.325
Yeah.

41:09.244 --> 41:12.038
So, well, what's the next step here, Jerry?

41:12.122 --> 41:14.707
They're gonna call me up
and give me instructions for a drop.

41:14.792 --> 41:16.375
I'm supposed to have the money
ready tomorrow.

41:16.460 --> 41:17.627
Damn it!

41:20.380 --> 41:21.923
How was everything today?

41:22.007 --> 41:23.800
Yeah. Real good, now.

41:25.636 --> 41:27.136
How you doing?

41:27.679 --> 41:31.099
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

41:31.183 --> 41:33.267
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

41:33.352 --> 41:37.271
Now, do you want anyone at home with you
till they call?

41:37.356 --> 41:38.856
No, I...
They don't...

41:38.941 --> 41:40.733
They were just supposed
to be dealing with me.

41:40.818 --> 41:41.984
- They were real clear.
- Yeah.

41:42.069 --> 41:44.237
You know, they said no one listening in.

41:44.321 --> 41:45.530
They'll be watching.

41:45.614 --> 41:47.573
You know, maybe it's all bull,

41:47.658 --> 41:50.201
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

41:50.285 --> 41:51.452
Okay.

41:51.912 --> 41:54.497
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

41:56.375 --> 41:58.292
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

41:58.836 --> 42:00.628
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

42:16.353 --> 42:18.479
How you doing there, Scotty?

42:18.897 --> 42:20.106
Dad...

42:21.024 --> 42:22.859
What are they doing?

42:23.694 --> 42:25.319
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

42:25.404 --> 42:27.071
It's okay, Scotty.

42:27.197 --> 42:28.906
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

42:28.991 --> 42:31.617
These men, they just want money.

42:32.286 --> 42:34.453
Yeah, well,
what if something goes wrong, Dad?

42:34.538 --> 42:38.124
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

42:38.208 --> 42:42.420
Granddad and I, we're, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

42:43.338 --> 42:45.506
I really think
we should call the cops here.

42:45.591 --> 42:48.885
No. No. No one can know
about this thing.

42:49.303 --> 42:51.220
We gotta play ball with these guys.

42:51.305 --> 42:53.431
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

42:53.515 --> 42:54.515
Yeah. But, Dad...

42:54.558 --> 42:58.060
We're gonna get Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

42:58.312 --> 42:59.562
You know?

43:01.106 --> 43:02.982
That's the deal here.

43:07.112 --> 43:09.906
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

43:09.990 --> 43:13.534
you just say Mom's down in Florida,
with Pearl and Marty.

43:17.581 --> 43:19.874
That's the best we can do here.

44:03.585 --> 44:04.919
No!

44:22.020 --> 44:23.062
No!

44:28.485 --> 44:30.236
Oh, God.

44:46.295 --> 44:47.378
Lunchtime.

44:47.462 --> 44:48.629
Thanks, Margaret.

44:48.714 --> 44:50.464
Hi. Hey.

44:51.008 --> 44:52.550
Willy. Carol.

44:53.302 --> 44:55.261
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

44:55.345 --> 44:56.345
Sure thing.

44:57.848 --> 44:59.265
Hiya, hon.

44:59.349 --> 45:01.142
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

45:02.269 --> 45:03.436
What are those?
Night crawlers?

45:03.520 --> 45:04.603
Yeah.

45:04.688 --> 45:05.938
Oh, thanks, hon.

45:06.023 --> 45:08.107
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

45:08.191 --> 45:10.318
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

45:10.402 --> 45:13.279
What do we got here, Arby's?

45:13.363 --> 45:14.864
How's the painting going?

45:14.948 --> 45:16.407
Pretty good.

45:17.284 --> 45:19.869
Found out the Hautmans are entering
a painting this year.

45:19.953 --> 45:22.079
Hon, you're better than them.

45:22.164 --> 45:24.040
They're real good.

45:24.124 --> 45:27.209
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

45:28.211 --> 45:29.628
You think so?

45:31.256 --> 45:33.549
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

45:35.927 --> 45:38.012
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

45:38.096 --> 45:39.638
Not too bad, you know.

45:39.723 --> 45:41.015
How we doing on that vehicle?

45:41.099 --> 45:43.768
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

45:43.852 --> 45:47.271
but the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox,

45:47.356 --> 45:50.483
registering a Cierra
and leaving the tag space blank.

45:50.567 --> 45:51.692
Jeez, that's a good lead.

45:51.777 --> 45:52.860
Yeah.

45:52.944 --> 45:55.446
Blue Ox, that's that truckers' joint
out there on I-35?

45:55.530 --> 45:58.157
Yeah. Owner was on the desk then.

45:58.241 --> 46:00.159
Said these two had company.

46:00.243 --> 46:01.327
Oh, yeah?

46:01.453 --> 46:02.578
Yeah.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.793
<i>Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.</i>

46:08.877 --> 46:10.753
I went to Normandale for about
a year and a half.

46:10.837 --> 46:11.962
Yeah, that's where we met.

46:12.047 --> 46:13.130
But I dropped out, though.

46:13.215 --> 46:14.256
Yeah, she dropped.

46:14.341 --> 46:15.383
Yeah.

46:15.717 --> 46:17.176
So where you girls from?

46:17.260 --> 46:19.095
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

46:19.179 --> 46:21.347
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

46:21.431 --> 46:22.681
Go Bears.

46:23.475 --> 46:27.186
Okay. I want you to tell me
what these fellows looked like.

46:27.437 --> 46:29.355
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of funny-looking.

46:29.439 --> 46:30.439
In what way?

46:30.524 --> 46:32.441
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

46:32.526 --> 46:34.860
Can you be any more specific?

46:34.945 --> 46:36.320
I couldn't really say.

46:36.405 --> 46:37.822
He wasn't circumcised.

46:39.282 --> 46:41.742
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

46:41.827 --> 46:42.952
Yeah.

46:44.246 --> 46:47.790
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

46:48.125 --> 46:49.333
Uh-huh.

46:49.418 --> 46:51.419
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

46:51.503 --> 46:54.380
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

46:54.464 --> 46:56.507
More than most people, even.

46:56.591 --> 46:57.758
What about the other fella?

46:57.843 --> 46:59.009
He was a little older.

46:59.094 --> 47:00.845
You know, he looked like
the Marlboro Man.

47:00.929 --> 47:02.555
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

47:02.639 --> 47:04.098
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

47:04.182 --> 47:06.517
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

47:06.601 --> 47:08.394
You know, like a subconscious
type of thing.

47:08.478 --> 47:09.645
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

47:09.729 --> 47:10.771
Yeah.

47:10.856 --> 47:12.898
Hey, they said they were going
to the Twin Cities.

47:12.983 --> 47:14.442
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

47:14.526 --> 47:16.026
Yeah, is that useful to you?

47:16.111 --> 47:17.653
You betcha. Yeah.

47:17.737 --> 47:19.071
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:21.241 --> 47:22.408
<i>Come on!</i>

47:23.618 --> 47:24.869
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

47:27.164 --> 47:28.831
Jesus Christ.

47:30.709 --> 47:32.334
Fucking shitbox.

47:33.753 --> 47:35.504
Been here for days.

47:36.840 --> 47:38.716
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

47:40.010 --> 47:42.052
Fucking TV doesn't even...

47:44.014 --> 47:47.766
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

47:49.561 --> 47:51.270
Goddamn it!

47:53.773 --> 47:55.733
Unbelievable! Come on!

47:56.276 --> 47:57.276
God...

47:58.111 --> 47:59.278
Fuck!

47:59.362 --> 48:02.656
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby!
Come on!

48:04.201 --> 48:05.493
Come on!

48:07.287 --> 48:09.038
Fuck! Fuck!

48:10.165 --> 48:11.624
Fuck! Fuck!

48:18.256 --> 48:21.800
<i>The bark beetle carries the worm
to its nest</i>

48:22.969 --> 48:26.180
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

48:28.892 --> 48:32.144
<i>In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

48:32.229 --> 48:33.479
Well...

48:34.773 --> 48:36.649
I'm turning in, Norm.

48:37.150 --> 48:38.484
Oh, yeah?

48:41.404 --> 48:43.739
<i>Here it is,
throwing off the larval envelope.</i>

48:57.796 --> 48:58.837
Hello?

48:58.922 --> 49:00.923
<i>Yeah. Is this Marge?</i>

49:01.216 --> 49:02.258
Yeah.

49:02.342 --> 49:03.968
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

49:05.053 --> 49:07.179
Yeah. Who's this?

49:07.264 --> 49:09.515
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

49:09.599 --> 49:12.184
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

49:14.604 --> 49:16.105
Mike Yanagita?

49:16.189 --> 49:17.606
<i>Yeah!</i>

49:18.191 --> 49:20.317
Well, yeah!

49:20.986 --> 49:22.611
Course I remember you.

49:22.696 --> 49:25.155
How are you doing?
What time is it?

49:25.240 --> 49:27.658
<i>Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.</i>

49:27.742 --> 49:29.118
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

49:29.202 --> 49:31.954
No. That's okay.

49:32.038 --> 49:34.123
<i>Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,</i>

49:34.207 --> 49:37.084
<i>and I was just watching on TV
about these shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

49:37.168 --> 49:38.669
<i>And I saw you on the news there.</i>

49:38.753 --> 49:39.795
Yeah.

49:39.879 --> 49:41.435
<i>I thought,
"Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"</i>

49:41.506 --> 49:42.673
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

49:42.757 --> 49:45.050
Yeah, that's me.

49:45.802 --> 49:47.469
<i>Well, how the heck are you?</i>

49:47.554 --> 49:49.179
Okay. You know.

49:50.056 --> 49:51.056
Okay.

49:51.141 --> 49:52.641
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

49:53.268 --> 49:54.727
How you doing?

49:54.811 --> 49:56.437
<i>Pretty good.</i>

49:57.439 --> 49:59.064
Well, heck.

49:59.149 --> 50:01.483
It's been such a long time, Mike.

50:02.277 --> 50:04.361
It's great to hear from you.

50:07.699 --> 50:09.575
Yeah, you got your...

50:09.659 --> 50:12.745
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

50:12.829 --> 50:16.165
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

50:16.249 --> 50:19.168
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

50:19.669 --> 50:22.254
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

50:22.339 --> 50:24.590
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

50:24.674 --> 50:26.508
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

50:26.593 --> 50:28.427
Yeah. You don't need that.

50:28.511 --> 50:30.262
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

50:30.347 --> 50:32.973
You ought to be aware
of this GMAC plan they have now.

50:33.058 --> 50:34.099
It's really super.

50:34.184 --> 50:35.351
Got a call for you, Jerry.

50:35.435 --> 50:36.810
Yeah, okay.

50:43.735 --> 50:44.902
Jerry Lundegaard.

50:44.986 --> 50:47.112
<i>All right, Jerry,
you got the phone to yourself?</i>

50:47.197 --> 50:48.280
Well, yeah.

50:48.365 --> 50:49.406
<i>You know who this is?</i>

50:49.491 --> 50:51.450
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

50:51.534 --> 50:53.410
How's that Cierra working out for you?

50:53.495 --> 50:55.746
<i>Circumstances have changed, Jerry.</i>

50:55.830 --> 50:56.955
Well...

50:57.832 --> 50:58.832
What do you mean?

50:58.917 --> 51:02.628
<i>Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry,
beyond the acts of God.</i>

51:02.712 --> 51:03.796
<i>Force majeure.</i>

51:03.880 --> 51:05.130
What the...

51:05.215 --> 51:06.548
How's Jean?

51:08.009 --> 51:09.009
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

51:09.094 --> 51:11.053
My wife. What the...

51:11.137 --> 51:13.180
<i>She's all right, but there's
three people up in Brainerd</i>

51:13.264 --> 51:14.473
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

51:14.557 --> 51:15.724
What the heck are you talking about?

51:15.809 --> 51:17.434
Let's just finish this deal up here.

51:17.519 --> 51:19.687
<i>Blood has been shed, Jerry.</i>

51:20.438 --> 51:21.480
What the heck do you mean?

51:21.564 --> 51:23.440
<i>Three people in Brainerd.</i>

51:23.525 --> 51:24.566
Oh, jeez.

51:24.651 --> 51:26.694
<i>That's right,
and we need more money.</i>

51:26.778 --> 51:27.986
What the heck are you talking about?

51:28.071 --> 51:29.988
What do you fellas got yourself
mixed up in?

51:30.073 --> 51:31.115
<i>We need more money...</i>

51:31.199 --> 51:33.242
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

51:33.326 --> 51:35.911
<i>Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

51:35.995 --> 51:38.163
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

51:38.248 --> 51:40.374
<i>I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

51:40.458 --> 51:42.000
<i>We now want the entire 80,000.</i>

51:42.085 --> 51:43.961
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

51:44.045 --> 51:45.254
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

51:45.338 --> 51:46.588
<i>We've incurred risk, Jerry.</i>

51:46.673 --> 51:47.840
<i>I'm coming into town tomorrow.</i>

51:47.924 --> 51:49.007
<i>You have the money ready.</i>

51:49.092 --> 51:51.510
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

51:51.594 --> 51:52.636
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

51:52.721 --> 51:54.888
<i>You ask those three poor souls
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.</i>

51:54.973 --> 51:56.098
<i>Go ahead, ask them!</i>

51:56.182 --> 51:57.224
The heck do you mean?

51:57.308 --> 51:59.727
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

52:03.982 --> 52:04.982
Yeah?

52:05.066 --> 52:06.108
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

52:06.192 --> 52:07.234
Yeah.

52:07.318 --> 52:08.986
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.</i>

52:09.070 --> 52:11.822
<i>Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs you promised.</i>

52:11.906 --> 52:13.240
Yeah. I...

52:13.658 --> 52:14.908
Those are in the mail.

52:14.993 --> 52:17.745
<i>That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,</i>

52:17.829 --> 52:20.622
<i>that absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

52:20.707 --> 52:23.208
<i>I will have to refer this matter
to our legal department.</i>

52:23.293 --> 52:24.334
Yeah.

52:24.419 --> 52:26.170
<i>- My patience is at an end.</i>
- Yeah.

52:26.254 --> 52:27.755
<i>- Good day, sir.</i>
- Yeah.

53:26.606 --> 53:29.066
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie?

53:29.818 --> 53:31.151
How's the fricassee?

53:31.236 --> 53:32.694
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

53:32.779 --> 53:34.029
Oh, no. I got...

53:34.113 --> 53:38.075
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

53:38.743 --> 53:40.452
Yeah. After lunch.

53:40.912 --> 53:42.246
What you got there?

53:42.330 --> 53:44.748
The numbers you asked for.

53:44.833 --> 53:47.501
Calls made from the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.

53:47.585 --> 53:49.628
Two to Minneapolis that night.

53:49.712 --> 53:51.046
First one's a trucking company

53:51.130 --> 53:53.006
and second one's a private residence,

53:53.091 --> 53:54.758
a Shep Proudfoot.

53:55.885 --> 53:57.135
A what?

53:57.220 --> 53:59.471
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

54:00.223 --> 54:01.431
Yeah.

54:02.559 --> 54:04.184
Okay. Yeah.

54:05.270 --> 54:07.145
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

54:07.230 --> 54:09.147
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

54:11.901 --> 54:13.193
Oh, yeah?

54:27.375 --> 54:30.252
Damn it, I want to be a part
of this thing.

54:30.336 --> 54:32.546
No. Wade, they were real clear.

54:32.630 --> 54:34.506
They said they'd call tomorrow
with instructions,

54:34.591 --> 54:36.466
and it's gotta be delivered
by me alone.

54:36.551 --> 54:38.802
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

54:39.304 --> 54:40.596
What do they care?

54:40.680 --> 54:41.972
Wade's got a point, there.

54:42.056 --> 54:43.538
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

54:43.600 --> 54:44.850
No, no. See, they...

54:44.934 --> 54:47.185
No. See, they only deal with me.

54:47.270 --> 54:51.023
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

54:51.107 --> 54:53.817
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

54:53.902 --> 54:56.403
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

54:56.487 --> 54:59.364
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you mucking this up.

54:59.449 --> 55:00.449
What the heck do you mean?

55:00.533 --> 55:02.075
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

55:02.160 --> 55:03.660
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

55:03.745 --> 55:05.370
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

55:05.455 --> 55:06.538
No. See...

55:06.623 --> 55:09.416
Look, Jerry,
you're not selling me a damn car!

55:09.500 --> 55:11.835
It's my show here.
That's that!

55:13.546 --> 55:16.506
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

55:22.555 --> 55:24.598
Hi. How you doing?

55:24.682 --> 55:26.391
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

55:26.476 --> 55:28.727
I'm doing really super there.
Thanks.

55:28.811 --> 55:31.647
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

55:32.815 --> 55:35.150
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

55:35.818 --> 55:38.153
Is there a phone down here, you think?

55:40.323 --> 55:41.990
Detective Sibert?

55:42.075 --> 55:45.619
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

55:46.371 --> 55:48.914
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

55:48.998 --> 55:50.958
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

55:51.042 --> 55:52.626
so I thought I'd check in with you

55:52.710 --> 55:55.212
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

55:56.965 --> 55:58.256
Oh, yeah?

55:59.133 --> 56:02.302
Well, maybe I'll go visit with him
if I have...

56:02.387 --> 56:04.262
No. I can find that.

56:05.306 --> 56:06.431
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

56:06.516 --> 56:09.309
Say, say, would you happen to know

56:09.394 --> 56:12.312
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

56:13.147 --> 56:14.606
The Radisson.

56:15.650 --> 56:17.693
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

57:34.812 --> 57:36.897
Hi. How you doing?

57:36.981 --> 57:39.441
Yeah. I decided not to park here.

57:39.901 --> 57:42.110
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

57:42.195 --> 57:45.030
Yeah, I just came in and I decided
not to park here, so...

57:45.114 --> 57:47.783
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

57:47.867 --> 57:50.160
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

57:51.079 --> 57:52.245
You know, I'm not...

57:52.330 --> 57:54.664
I decided not to take the trip,
as it turns out, so...

57:54.749 --> 57:57.959
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
we still got to charge you the $4.

57:59.796 --> 58:01.088
I just pulled in here.

58:01.214 --> 58:02.547
I just fucking pulled in here.

58:02.632 --> 58:03.715
Well, but...

58:03.800 --> 58:06.259
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

58:06.344 --> 58:09.137
Long-term parking charges by the day.

58:13.851 --> 58:16.978
I guess you think you're, you know,
like an authority figure.

58:17.063 --> 58:19.397
That stupid fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?

58:19.482 --> 58:20.899
King clip-on tie there.

58:20.983 --> 58:22.400
Big fucking man, huh?

58:23.027 --> 58:25.278
You know, these are the limits
of your life, man.

58:25.363 --> 58:26.738
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

58:26.823 --> 58:29.449
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

58:32.036 --> 58:33.537
Where's Shep?

58:33.788 --> 58:35.455
Talking to a cop.

58:35.540 --> 58:36.706
Cop?

58:37.041 --> 58:38.792
Said she was a cop.

58:41.420 --> 58:44.256
So do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

58:44.340 --> 58:45.465
Nope.

58:46.092 --> 58:49.344
You do reside there
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

58:49.428 --> 58:50.428
Yep.

58:50.513 --> 58:52.514
Anyone else residing there?

58:52.598 --> 58:53.682
No.

58:53.766 --> 58:57.769
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

58:57.854 --> 59:01.982
It's just hard for me to believe
you don't remember anyone calling.

59:02.483 --> 59:04.776
Now, I know you've had some problems.

59:04.861 --> 59:06.695
Struggling with the narcotics,

59:06.779 --> 59:09.698
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

59:10.408 --> 59:11.408
So?

59:11.492 --> 59:12.909
Well, associating with criminals,

59:12.994 --> 59:14.244
if you're the one they talked to,

59:14.328 --> 59:17.455
that right there would be a violation
of your parole.

59:17.540 --> 59:20.041
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

59:20.459 --> 59:22.460
Now, I saw some rough stuff
on your priors,

59:22.545 --> 59:24.129
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

59:24.213 --> 59:28.216
I know you don't want to be an accessory
to something like that.

59:30.178 --> 59:31.303
So, you think you might remember

59:31.387 --> 59:33.889
who those folks were who called you?

59:42.773 --> 59:44.024
Mr. Lundegaard?

59:44.108 --> 59:45.317
Yeah.

59:45.401 --> 59:47.277
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

59:47.361 --> 59:49.154
What is it all about?

59:49.739 --> 59:50.906
Do you mind if I sit down?

59:50.990 --> 59:53.033
Carrying quite a load here.

59:53.242 --> 59:55.118
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

59:55.203 --> 59:57.537
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

59:57.622 --> 59:59.456
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

59:59.540 --> 01:00:01.666
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:02.918
Uh-huh.

01:00:03.002 --> 01:00:05.003
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

01:00:05.087 --> 01:00:06.838
investigating some malfeasance.

01:00:06.923 --> 01:00:09.382
And I was just wondering
if you'd had any new vehicles

01:00:09.467 --> 01:00:12.552
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:16.097
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

01:00:20.686 --> 01:00:22.229
Mr. Lundegaard.

01:00:24.815 --> 01:00:26.107
Brainerd.

01:00:26.859 --> 01:00:28.193
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:28.277 --> 01:00:30.779
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

01:00:30.863 --> 01:00:32.530
Babe, the Blue Ox.

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:39.746
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.877
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

01:00:45.962 --> 01:00:47.462
Nope. No, ma'am.

01:00:48.381 --> 01:00:49.673
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

01:00:49.757 --> 01:00:52.759
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

01:01:06.941 --> 01:01:08.483
<i>- Service.</i>
- Yeah, get me Shep.

01:01:08.567 --> 01:01:09.818
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

01:01:09.902 --> 01:01:10.944
What the heck do you mean?

01:01:11.028 --> 01:01:12.570
<i>He stepped out.</i>

01:01:12.655 --> 01:01:14.114
- Where'd he go? It's only...
<i>- I'll get you Artie.</i>

01:01:14.198 --> 01:01:17.367
No. I don't need a mechanic.
I need a...

01:01:19.912 --> 01:01:23.456
Jeez. I gotta talk to a friend of his,

01:01:23.916 --> 01:01:25.500
so...

01:01:26.127 --> 01:01:28.169
Have him...

01:01:29.505 --> 01:01:30.588
<i>What?</i>

01:01:30.673 --> 01:01:31.673
Oh, jeez.

01:01:52.528 --> 01:01:53.653
Mike?

01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:55.655
Marge?

01:01:57.575 --> 01:02:00.285
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:02.620
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

01:02:02.705 --> 01:02:06.041
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too.

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:07.751
I'm expecting now.

01:02:07.835 --> 01:02:10.045
I see that. That's great.

01:02:10.129 --> 01:02:11.504
What can I get you?

01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:13.465
Just a Diet Coke, please.

01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:15.133
Great.

01:02:15.885 --> 01:02:17.177
This is a nice place.

01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:20.722
Yeah. You know, it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.

01:02:20.890 --> 01:02:21.931
Yeah.

01:02:26.395 --> 01:02:27.479
So...

01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:29.647
You're living in Edina, then?

01:02:29.732 --> 01:02:31.816
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

01:02:31.901 --> 01:02:33.651
It's actually Eden Prairie.

01:02:33.736 --> 01:02:35.278
That school district.

01:02:35.696 --> 01:02:38.365
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

01:02:38.741 --> 01:02:41.326
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.078
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

01:02:43.162 --> 01:02:44.788
Great, great.

01:02:45.122 --> 01:02:47.582
So, what brings you down?

01:02:48.084 --> 01:02:49.793
Are you down here on that homicide,

01:02:49.877 --> 01:02:52.128
if you're allowed, you know,
to discuss that?

01:02:52.213 --> 01:02:53.505
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:56.383
But there's not a heck
of a lot to discuss.

01:02:57.259 --> 01:02:58.802
Okay.

01:02:58.886 --> 01:03:00.178
Well, what about you, Mike?

01:03:00.262 --> 01:03:01.513
Are you married?

01:03:01.597 --> 01:03:02.680
You got kids?

01:03:02.765 --> 01:03:04.557
Yeah, yeah. Well...

01:03:05.101 --> 01:03:07.811
I was married.
I was married to...

01:03:07.895 --> 01:03:09.813
You mind if I sit over here?

01:03:09.897 --> 01:03:11.898
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

01:03:11.982 --> 01:03:15.068
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:19.406
Okay.

01:03:22.284 --> 01:03:23.368
Sorry.

01:03:23.452 --> 01:03:26.204
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

01:03:26.288 --> 01:03:28.540
Sure, sure. I understand.

01:03:29.792 --> 01:03:31.042
I didn't mean to...

01:03:31.127 --> 01:03:34.587
No, no. That's fine.

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:39.134
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:42.554
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

01:03:42.638 --> 01:03:45.432
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

01:03:45.516 --> 01:03:46.975
Yeah. I think I remember her.

01:03:47.059 --> 01:03:49.853
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

01:03:49.937 --> 01:03:51.521
So, it didn't work out, huh?

01:03:51.605 --> 01:03:55.150
And then I've been working for Honeywell
for a few years now.

01:03:55.234 --> 01:03:56.401
Well, they're a good outfit.

01:03:56.485 --> 01:04:00.238
Yeah, if you're an engineer, yeah,
you could do a lot worse.

01:04:00.322 --> 01:04:01.990
But it's not...

01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:04.242
It's nothing like your achievement.

01:04:04.326 --> 01:04:07.328
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

01:04:07.413 --> 01:04:08.997
It's not that...

01:04:09.081 --> 01:04:12.333
It's not that things didn't work out.
It's...

01:04:13.752 --> 01:04:16.546
Linda had leukemia, you know.

01:04:17.339 --> 01:04:19.466
She was...
She passed away.

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:20.967
No.

01:04:23.387 --> 01:04:24.512
It was tough.

01:04:24.597 --> 01:04:25.889
There you go.

01:04:26.348 --> 01:04:28.016
It was long...

01:04:29.393 --> 01:04:32.020
She fought real hard, Marge.

01:04:32.897 --> 01:04:34.272
You know...

01:04:35.024 --> 01:04:36.608
So, what can you say?

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.863
Better times, huh?

01:04:41.947 --> 01:04:43.406
Better times.

01:04:45.993 --> 01:04:50.830
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:52.707
I always liked you.

01:04:52.791 --> 01:04:54.042
Well, I always liked you...

01:04:54.126 --> 01:04:55.877
I always liked you so much.

01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:02.842
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

01:05:02.927 --> 01:05:04.260
No! I...

01:05:08.599 --> 01:05:10.266
I'm sorry. It's...

01:05:10.351 --> 01:05:12.727
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

01:05:12.811 --> 01:05:14.854
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

01:05:14.939 --> 01:05:17.482
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

01:05:17.566 --> 01:05:18.983
It's okay, Mike.

01:05:19.068 --> 01:05:21.569
You were such a super lady.

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:24.906
And then...
I've been so lonely.

01:05:27.785 --> 01:05:29.285
It's okay, Mike.

01:05:35.626 --> 01:05:39.462
<i>Here's a song I dedicate
to all the ladies out here tonight.</i>

01:05:40.339 --> 01:05:41.756
Goes like this.

01:05:42.633 --> 01:05:45.677
♪<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

01:05:46.512 --> 01:05:48.930
♪<i>Everything will be all right</i>

01:05:50.349 --> 01:05:52.267
♪<i>Don't hesitate now</i>

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:54.018
♪<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

01:05:54.144 --> 01:05:55.436
So...

01:05:56.105 --> 01:05:58.064
Are you from around here?

01:05:58.857 --> 01:06:00.692
Just in town on business.

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:02.360
Just in and out.

01:06:05.114 --> 01:06:07.657
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

01:06:08.784 --> 01:06:10.201
What do you do?

01:06:11.453 --> 01:06:12.537
I...

01:06:16.542 --> 01:06:18.042
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

01:06:18.127 --> 01:06:20.086
With other clients?

01:06:20.588 --> 01:06:22.046
I don't think so.

01:06:22.131 --> 01:06:23.590
It's nice.

01:06:23.674 --> 01:06:26.134
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

01:06:26.302 --> 01:06:29.429
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

01:06:30.055 --> 01:06:31.139
Waiter!

01:06:33.309 --> 01:06:34.976
What is he, deaf?

01:06:35.811 --> 01:06:37.061
So...

01:06:38.147 --> 01:06:40.523
How long you work
for the escort service?

01:06:40.608 --> 01:06:42.692
I don't know. A few months.

01:06:43.819 --> 01:06:46.279
Find that work interesting, do you?

01:06:47.364 --> 01:06:49.407
What are you talking about?

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:51.242
Right.

01:06:51.327 --> 01:06:52.660
Come on.

01:06:52.745 --> 01:06:54.746
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

01:06:56.582 --> 01:06:59.125
All right. Where were you?

01:07:03.339 --> 01:07:06.758
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

01:07:06.842 --> 01:07:11.220
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:11.347 --> 01:07:14.307
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

01:07:14.391 --> 01:07:15.933
Get the fuck out of here.

01:07:17.144 --> 01:07:19.020
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

01:07:19.104 --> 01:07:21.064
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

01:07:22.191 --> 01:07:23.232
Come on, brother...

01:07:23.317 --> 01:07:24.567
Fuck you!

01:07:30.991 --> 01:07:32.408
Fuck you.

01:07:32.493 --> 01:07:33.660
Animals!

01:07:35.663 --> 01:07:37.288
Stay away from me, man.

01:07:37.373 --> 01:07:39.457
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.417
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

01:07:48.842 --> 01:07:50.551
Fucking little weasel!

01:07:50.636 --> 01:07:52.345
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it!

01:07:52.429 --> 01:07:56.265
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:59.977
Jesus Christ!
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:04.941
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:08:05.025 --> 01:08:06.234
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

01:08:06.318 --> 01:08:07.402
<i>You got the fucking money?</i>

01:08:07.486 --> 01:08:09.529
Yeah, I got the money, but...

01:08:09.613 --> 01:08:11.322
<i>Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.</i>

01:08:11.407 --> 01:08:14.367
<i>I want you to put this money in the Dayton
Radisson parking ramp, top level,</i>

01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:15.993
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

01:08:16.078 --> 01:08:17.120
Okay. But...

01:08:17.203 --> 01:08:19.455
Hey, you're there in 30 minutes
or I find you, Jerry,

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.997
and I shoot you
and I shoot your fucking wife,

01:08:21.082 --> 01:08:22.375
and I shoot all
your little fucking children

01:08:22.459 --> 01:08:24.961
and I shoot them all in the back
of their little fucking heads. You got it?

01:08:25.045 --> 01:08:26.837
Okay, now, you stay away from Scotty, now.

01:08:26.921 --> 01:08:27.964
<i>Got it?</i>

01:08:28.048 --> 01:08:29.674
Okay. Real good, then.

01:08:54.742 --> 01:08:55.950
Dad.

01:08:56.577 --> 01:08:57.952
It's okay, Scotty.

01:08:58.036 --> 01:08:59.703
Where you going?

01:09:00.037 --> 01:09:02.122
I'll be back in a minute.

01:09:02.374 --> 01:09:06.711
If Stan calls,
you just tell him I went to Embers.

01:09:09.046 --> 01:09:10.131
Okay.

01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:12.800
Here's your damn money.

01:09:13.594 --> 01:09:15.595
Now, where's my daughter?

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.345
Yeah.

01:09:17.765 --> 01:09:20.640
You goddamn punk!

01:09:36.992 --> 01:09:38.785
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:41.662 --> 01:09:43.413
Who the fuck are you?

01:09:43.499 --> 01:09:46.542
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

01:09:47.502 --> 01:09:49.127
I am through fucking around!

01:09:49.212 --> 01:09:50.921
Drop that fucking briefcase!

01:09:51.006 --> 01:09:52.590
Where's my daughter?

01:09:52.674 --> 01:09:55.009
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

01:09:55.093 --> 01:09:57.428
I gave simple fucking instructions.

01:09:57.513 --> 01:09:59.222
Where's my damn daughter?

01:09:59.306 --> 01:10:00.598
No Jean, no money.

01:10:00.682 --> 01:10:02.600
Drop that fucking money!

01:10:02.684 --> 01:10:04.352
No Jean, no money!

01:10:06.146 --> 01:10:08.147
Is this a fucking joke here?

01:10:14.655 --> 01:10:18.115
Oh, jeez.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.284
You happy now, asshole?

01:10:20.369 --> 01:10:22.036
What's with you people?

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.996
You fucking imbeciles!

01:10:31.839 --> 01:10:33.965
You fucking shot me!

01:11:51.084 --> 01:11:53.169
May I have your ticket, please?

01:11:53.253 --> 01:11:54.962
Open the fucking gate!

01:12:34.503 --> 01:12:35.962
Oh, jeez.

01:13:06.201 --> 01:13:07.284
Dad?

01:13:07.369 --> 01:13:08.452
Yeah?

01:13:08.912 --> 01:13:10.705
Stan Grossman called.

01:13:11.039 --> 01:13:12.331
Yeah. Okay.

01:13:12.416 --> 01:13:13.416
Twice.

01:13:13.542 --> 01:13:14.542
Okay.

01:13:16.545 --> 01:13:18.254
Is everything okay?

01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:19.755
Yeah.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.300
Are you calling Stan?

01:13:25.429 --> 01:13:27.054
Well, I'm...

01:13:28.598 --> 01:13:30.433
I'm going to bed now.

01:14:07.304 --> 01:14:08.471
How you doing?

01:14:08.555 --> 01:14:10.181
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

01:14:10.515 --> 01:14:11.682
Officer Olson.

01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:13.267
Yeah. Righto.

01:14:14.102 --> 01:14:15.311
Well...

01:14:15.395 --> 01:14:18.564
So I'm tending bar down there at Ecklund
and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

01:14:18.648 --> 01:14:20.357
and this little guy's drinking,

01:14:20.442 --> 01:14:22.485
and he says,
"Where can a guy find some action?

01:14:22.569 --> 01:14:24.820
"I'm going crazy out
there at the lake."

01:14:24.905 --> 01:14:26.363
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

01:14:26.448 --> 01:14:28.657
And he says,
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

01:14:28.742 --> 01:14:30.201
And I says,
"Well, what do I look like?

01:14:30.285 --> 01:14:32.411
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

01:14:32.496 --> 01:14:35.039
And he says,
"But I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

01:14:35.123 --> 01:14:38.375
And I says,
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:41.921
He says, "Oh, so I get it. So you think
I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

01:14:42.005 --> 01:14:43.547
Only he don't use the word "jerk."

01:14:43.632 --> 01:14:45.216
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:47.718
says the last guy thought he's a jerk
is dead now.

01:14:47.803 --> 01:14:49.386
So, I don't say nothing.

01:14:49.471 --> 01:14:51.388
He says,
"What do you think about that?"

01:14:51.473 --> 01:14:54.892
And I says, "Well, that don't sound
like too good a deal for him, then."

01:14:54.976 --> 01:14:56.018
You got that right.

01:14:56.103 --> 01:14:57.853
Yeah, he says,
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

01:14:57.938 --> 01:14:59.396
"and I don't mean of old age."

01:14:59.481 --> 01:15:03.025
And then he says, "Jeez, I'm going
crazy out there at the lake."

01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:04.110
White Bear Lake?

01:15:04.194 --> 01:15:06.654
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

01:15:06.738 --> 01:15:07.905
So I made that assumption.

01:15:07.989 --> 01:15:08.989
Sure.

01:15:09.032 --> 01:15:10.825
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

01:15:10.909 --> 01:15:12.618
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

01:15:12.702 --> 01:15:15.746
but then Mrs. Mohra,
she heard about the homicides down here

01:15:15.831 --> 01:15:19.959
and thought I should call it in,
so I called it in.

01:15:22.212 --> 01:15:23.754
End of story.

01:15:24.381 --> 01:15:25.840
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

01:15:25.924 --> 01:15:27.508
Oh, he's a...

01:15:27.634 --> 01:15:29.218
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

01:15:30.178 --> 01:15:31.554
In what way?

01:15:31.638 --> 01:15:33.597
Just in a general kind of way.

01:15:33.682 --> 01:15:36.267
Okay. Well, thanks a bunch,
Mr. Mohra.

01:15:36.351 --> 01:15:38.060
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

01:15:38.145 --> 01:15:39.311
but thanks for calling her in.

01:15:39.396 --> 01:15:40.646
Sure.

01:15:40.730 --> 01:15:43.315
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:45.693
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

01:15:45.861 --> 01:15:48.070
Yeah.
You got that right.

01:16:07.424 --> 01:16:08.841
Jesus Christ.

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.939
Valerie, I'm leaving this morning,
back up to Brainerd.

01:18:29.024 --> 01:18:31.442
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

01:18:31.693 --> 01:18:32.943
But you think he's all right?

01:18:33.028 --> 01:18:34.153
I saw him last night and...

01:18:34.237 --> 01:18:35.279
<i>What did he say?</i>

01:18:35.363 --> 01:18:37.072
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

01:18:37.157 --> 01:18:40.326
It just seemed like it all hit him
really hard, his wife dying.

01:18:40.410 --> 01:18:42.286
<i>- His wife?</i>
- Linda.

01:18:42.412 --> 01:18:44.413
<i>- Who?</i>
- Linda Cooksey.

01:18:44.497 --> 01:18:46.290
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

01:18:46.374 --> 01:18:49.293
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

01:18:49.377 --> 01:18:52.504
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

01:18:52.839 --> 01:18:54.089
So...

01:18:54.632 --> 01:18:56.091
He didn't...

01:18:56.634 --> 01:18:57.634
He never...

01:18:57.719 --> 01:18:59.428
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

01:18:59.512 --> 01:19:01.972
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

01:19:02.057 --> 01:19:03.474
Oh, my.

01:19:03.558 --> 01:19:05.059
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

01:19:05.143 --> 01:19:07.478
<i>He's living with his parents now.</i>

01:19:08.646 --> 01:19:09.980
Oh, jeez.

01:19:10.065 --> 01:19:12.483
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

01:19:12.567 --> 01:19:14.109
Jeez. Well...

01:19:14.736 --> 01:19:15.861
Jeez.

01:19:17.572 --> 01:19:19.239
That's a surprise.

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:30.459
Hello!

01:20:11.459 --> 01:20:14.420
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

01:20:14.504 --> 01:20:17.548
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

01:20:17.632 --> 01:20:20.134
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

01:20:20.218 --> 01:20:23.053
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

01:20:23.138 --> 01:20:24.346
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:20:24.431 --> 01:20:25.556
Carrying a bit of a load here.

01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.765
No, I...

01:20:26.850 --> 01:20:28.591
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

01:20:28.643 --> 01:20:29.685
I was just wondering...

01:20:29.769 --> 01:20:32.896
Yeah, like I told you,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

01:20:32.981 --> 01:20:35.023
Okay. Are you sure?

01:20:36.025 --> 01:20:38.444
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

01:20:38.528 --> 01:20:40.195
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating,

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.448
the perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates,

01:20:42.532 --> 01:20:43.782
and they called someone who works here,

01:20:43.867 --> 01:20:45.571
so it'd be quite a coincidence
if they weren't,

01:20:45.618 --> 01:20:47.411
you know, connected.

01:20:48.037 --> 01:20:49.455
Yeah, I see.

01:20:49.622 --> 01:20:50.956
So, how do you...

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.167
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

01:20:53.251 --> 01:20:54.918
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

01:20:55.003 --> 01:20:57.087
But how do you know that for sure
without doing a...

01:20:57.172 --> 01:20:58.839
Well, I would know.

01:20:59.007 --> 01:21:00.674
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

01:21:00.758 --> 01:21:02.468
Yeah, but I understand...

01:21:02.552 --> 01:21:04.094
We run a pretty tight ship here.

01:21:04.179 --> 01:21:05.179
I know, but...

01:21:05.263 --> 01:21:07.306
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:08.807
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

01:21:08.892 --> 01:21:10.767
or what kind of a routine here?

01:21:10.852 --> 01:21:13.312
Ma'am, I answered your question.

01:21:17.609 --> 01:21:18.650
I'm sorry, sir?

01:21:18.735 --> 01:21:21.028
Ma'am, I answered your question.

01:21:21.696 --> 01:21:22.779
I answered the darn...

01:21:22.864 --> 01:21:26.116
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

01:21:29.787 --> 01:21:32.623
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

01:21:32.707 --> 01:21:34.249
I'm just doing my job here.

01:21:34.334 --> 01:21:35.501
I'm...

01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:40.422
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

01:21:40.507 --> 01:21:42.883
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

01:21:42.967 --> 01:21:45.052
We're doing all we can.

01:21:51.768 --> 01:21:54.561
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

01:21:58.566 --> 01:22:00.067
Mr. Lundegaard.

01:22:03.279 --> 01:22:06.698
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

01:22:06.783 --> 01:22:09.451
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

01:22:09.536 --> 01:22:12.454
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

01:22:12.539 --> 01:22:13.622
Sir, right now?

01:22:13.706 --> 01:22:15.290
Yeah! Right now.

01:22:15.959 --> 01:22:17.751
You're darn tooting!

01:22:18.419 --> 01:22:21.630
If it's so damned important to you.

01:22:22.257 --> 01:22:23.966
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:26.260
What the Christ! Jeez!

01:22:39.774 --> 01:22:42.609
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

01:23:11.014 --> 01:23:12.806
For Pete's sake.

01:23:16.477 --> 01:23:18.395
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

01:23:18.479 --> 01:23:20.647
He's fleeing the interview!

01:23:21.983 --> 01:23:24.401
How do I get an outside line here?

01:23:26.237 --> 01:23:27.487
All right.

01:23:30.742 --> 01:23:33.035
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

01:23:34.829 --> 01:23:37.497
<i>I told you it was over,
and I thought I made myself very clear.</i>

01:23:37.582 --> 01:23:40.375
<i>Oh, you did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.</i>

01:23:40.460 --> 01:23:42.336
<i>But something's come up.</i>

01:23:42.795 --> 01:23:43.879
<i>What?</i>

01:23:44.172 --> 01:23:45.505
<i>Well, it's something kind of small,</i>

01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:47.799
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>

01:23:47.925 --> 01:23:49.426
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

01:23:51.012 --> 01:23:52.512
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

01:23:54.349 --> 01:23:56.933
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

01:23:57.018 --> 01:24:00.520
<i>and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:05.651
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

01:24:05.818 --> 01:24:09.196
<i>See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.</i>

01:24:10.114 --> 01:24:12.366
You should see the other guy.

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:14.826
<i>No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.</i>

01:24:14.911 --> 01:24:16.036
<i>You don't understand!</i>

01:24:16.120 --> 01:24:17.871
<i>I read that letter that she wrote.</i>

01:24:17.955 --> 01:24:19.539
<i>I think I understand all there is...</i>

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:21.375
What happened to her?

01:24:22.710 --> 01:24:25.337
She started shrieking, you know.

01:24:25.421 --> 01:24:26.546
Jeez.

01:24:27.298 --> 01:24:29.383
Well, I got the money.

01:24:29.884 --> 01:24:32.552
All of it, all 80 grand.

01:24:34.722 --> 01:24:37.432
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

01:24:39.519 --> 01:24:41.103
That's it, then.

01:24:45.858 --> 01:24:47.359
You can have my truck.

01:24:47.485 --> 01:24:48.985
I'm taking the Cierra.

01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:50.570
We split that.

01:24:52.699 --> 01:24:55.951
How the fuck do you split
a fucking car, you dummy?

01:24:56.244 --> 01:24:58.245
With a fucking chain saw?

01:24:58.496 --> 01:25:01.164
One of us pays the other for half.

01:25:01.416 --> 01:25:03.917
Hold on.
No fucking way.

01:25:04.794 --> 01:25:06.920
Did you fucking notice this?

01:25:07.755 --> 01:25:09.464
I got fucking shot!

01:25:09.841 --> 01:25:12.092
I got fucking shot in the face!

01:25:12.176 --> 01:25:13.719
I went and got the fucking money!

01:25:13.803 --> 01:25:15.554
I got shot fucking picking it up!

01:25:15.638 --> 01:25:18.348
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

01:25:19.684 --> 01:25:21.143
I'm taking that fucking car!

01:25:21.227 --> 01:25:24.563
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

01:25:24.772 --> 01:25:28.066
You know, I've been listening
to your fucking bullshit all week!

01:25:28.192 --> 01:25:29.693
Are we square?

01:25:31.779 --> 01:25:33.572
Are we square?

01:25:35.616 --> 01:25:37.492
Yeah, you fucking mute!

01:25:39.579 --> 01:25:41.496
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

01:25:41.581 --> 01:25:44.040
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

01:25:46.169 --> 01:25:48.420
<i>I'll call you...
Later.</i>

01:26:00.099 --> 01:26:03.310
<i>His wife. This guy says
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

01:26:03.394 --> 01:26:04.853
The day of our homicides.

01:26:04.937 --> 01:26:06.021
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:06.105 --> 01:26:07.397
And this guy was who?

01:26:07.482 --> 01:26:10.108
<i>Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.</i>

01:26:10.193 --> 01:26:11.860
Gustafson's accountant.

01:26:11.944 --> 01:26:13.069
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:26:13.154 --> 01:26:14.821
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

01:26:14.906 --> 01:26:16.615
<i>Looking...</i>

01:26:16.699 --> 01:26:18.408
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

01:26:18.493 --> 01:26:20.076
<i>Still missing.
We're looking.</i>

01:26:20.161 --> 01:26:22.162
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

01:26:22.371 --> 01:26:24.790
<i>Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?</i>

01:26:24.874 --> 01:26:26.041
I'm almost back.

01:26:26.125 --> 01:26:27.667
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

01:26:27.752 --> 01:26:29.753
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

01:26:30.046 --> 01:26:31.421
Yeah, the loudmouth.

01:26:31.506 --> 01:26:33.089
So the whole state has it, huh?

01:26:33.174 --> 01:26:35.008
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:36.384
<i>Yeah. It's over the wire.</i>

01:26:36.469 --> 01:26:37.844
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

01:26:37.929 --> 01:26:39.054
Copy.

01:26:39.514 --> 01:26:40.639
<i>Yeah, we got a lead on this...</i>

01:26:40.723 --> 01:26:42.098
There's the car!
There's the car!

01:26:42.183 --> 01:26:43.183
<i>Whose car?</i>

01:26:43.267 --> 01:26:46.603
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

01:26:47.188 --> 01:26:50.190
<i>Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.</i>

01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:44.888
Police!

01:28:52.647 --> 01:28:54.230
Hands up!

01:28:54.523 --> 01:28:55.732
Police!

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:00.320
Police!

01:30:00.339 --> 01:30:03.550
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

01:30:08.639 --> 01:30:12.183
And I guess that was your accomplice
in the wood chipper.

01:30:16.856 --> 01:30:19.274
And those three people in Brainerd.

01:30:24.655 --> 01:30:26.114
And for what?

01:30:27.324 --> 01:30:29.367
For a little bit of money.

01:30:34.915 --> 01:30:38.168
There's more to life than a little money,
you know?

01:30:47.803 --> 01:30:49.596
Don't you know that?

01:30:55.978 --> 01:30:57.729
And here you are.

01:30:58.939 --> 01:31:00.899
And it's a beautiful day.

01:31:10.242 --> 01:31:11.451
Well...

01:31:24.298 --> 01:31:26.382
I just don't understand it.

01:32:08.717 --> 01:32:10.176
Mr. Anderson?

01:32:11.512 --> 01:32:12.762
Who?

01:32:12.847 --> 01:32:16.266
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98 out here?

01:32:17.685 --> 01:32:19.144
Just a sec.

01:32:19.228 --> 01:32:20.937
Could you open the door, please?

01:32:21.021 --> 01:32:22.939
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:24.816
Just a sec.

01:32:32.366 --> 01:32:34.325
- Dale!
- My leg!

01:32:34.410 --> 01:32:35.618
No!

01:33:14.909 --> 01:33:16.576
They announced it.

01:33:18.162 --> 01:33:19.579
They announced it?

01:33:19.663 --> 01:33:20.788
Yeah.

01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:22.332
So?

01:33:23.334 --> 01:33:24.959
Three-cent stamp.

01:33:25.711 --> 01:33:27.170
Your mallard?

01:33:27.421 --> 01:33:28.463
Yeah.

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:31.174
That's terrific.

01:33:31.258 --> 01:33:33.218
It's just a three-cent.

01:33:33.761 --> 01:33:34.844
It's terrific.

01:33:34.929 --> 01:33:37.639
Hautman's blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

01:33:38.265 --> 01:33:40.391
People don't much use the three-cent.

01:33:40.476 --> 01:33:43.061
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

01:33:44.271 --> 01:33:45.730
Whenever they raise the postage,

01:33:45.814 --> 01:33:47.690
people need the little stamps.

01:33:48.150 --> 01:33:49.525
Yeah?

01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:52.612
When they're stuck
with a bunch of the old ones.

01:33:52.696 --> 01:33:53.947
Yeah.

01:33:54.698 --> 01:33:56.074
I guess.

01:33:57.576 --> 01:34:00.703
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:07.252
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

01:34:09.797 --> 01:34:11.589
I love you, Margie.

01:34:12.633 --> 01:34:14.259
I love you, Norm.

01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:19.097
Two more months.

01:34:22.666 --> 01:34:23.960
Two more months.
