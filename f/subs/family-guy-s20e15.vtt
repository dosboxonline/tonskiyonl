- Hell yeah.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.311
- Let's do it.
- All right.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.897
I mixed up the letters.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.191
- We-
- We'll... We'll-we'll get there.

01:10.195 --> 01:14.157
Gentlemen, the going rate
is 20 bucks a game over here.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.742
Who's got
a pair of stones big enough

01:15.742 --> 01:18.495
to challenge the mighty Meg?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.413
My money's on the table.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.415
Can you please
get out of my way?

01:22.499 --> 01:24.417
- Come take my money.
- My hand is bleeding,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.753
and I need to wash it
so it doesn't get infected!

01:26.753 --> 01:28.213
Oh, okay.

01:28.213 --> 01:30.382
He scurred. Everybody scurred.

01:30.382 --> 01:32.258

01:32.342 --> 01:34.803
Bruce, how we doing
on those Gulden's packets?

01:34.803 --> 01:38.348
I got my mind on my mustard
and my mustard on my mind.

01:40.642 --> 01:42.060
There it is.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.229
What is going on with you today?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.689
I'm just so bored.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.565
Ain't nobody forcing you
to stay here.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.942
Go do something.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.361
I did. I went over
to that new car wash.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.656
They got all the rainbow lights.
Real classy joint.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.493
Anyway, they say I can only
go through five times.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.412
Like,
why would you restrict that?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.247
Listen, Meg, I got to run.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.208
A special-needs boy got
his hands on a Rum and Coke,

02:05.208 --> 02:08.878
and he's absolutely destroying
the arcade.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.840
Hey, if you
really got nothing going on,

02:11.840 --> 02:13.925
I could use a ride home.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.261
Yeah, like I'm really gonna let some...

02:16.261 --> 02:18.972
hot piece of ass in my car.

02:18.972 --> 02:21.683
How the hell are you doing, boy?

02:21.683 --> 02:24.060
I'm good, thanks.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.687
My name's Seymour.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
I'm Meg. But everyone here
calls me Thrash.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.899
- Heya, Meg.
- Wow.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.568
Yeah, I'll give you a ride.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.237
Just hope you don't mind
going fast.

02:36.031 --> 02:38.199
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.078
Oh, sorry. That's my phone.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.706
Let it go to voice mail.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.048
Gentlemen, welcome
to Virtual Reality World.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.216
Now, who's ready
to put something on your face

02:55.300 --> 02:58.636
that was on someone else's face
15 minutes ago?

03:01.139 --> 03:04.976
Wow! Mine says, "Low battery.
Charge immediately."

03:05.060 --> 03:07.228
Is this real life?

03:11.775 --> 03:14.778
Aw, cool.
<i>Virtual Reality: The Hulk.</i>

03:14.778 --> 03:16.529
What's going on?
What's happening?

03:16.613 --> 03:19.449
I don't know. It's weird.
It keeps stopping and rebooting.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.034
Eric Bana, smash.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.786
Edward Norton, smash.

03:22.786 --> 03:25.455
- Okay, here we go. Mark Ruffalo.
- Are you smashing?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.832
No, I'm mainly just updating
my Twitter avatar

03:27.916 --> 03:29.542
to raise awareness
about fracking.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.169
That's lame. Try getting angry.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.963
Uh, I don't get angry. I vote.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.882
I vote.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.179
So, Seymour,
you from around here?

03:41.179 --> 03:42.514
Just moved here from Philly.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.557
Oh, right on. I love Philly.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.142
- I hated it...
- Kind of a dump.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.353
- ...when I had to leave.
- Great town.

03:48.353 --> 03:50.522
Maybe I'm thinking of Dallas.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.649
- You want some mustard?
- No, thanks.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.485
I had a chalky, expired Kit Kat
at the bowling alley.

03:55.485 --> 03:56.653
Right on.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.740
Sorry for all the packet racket.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.784
These things
can be a little tricky.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.412
There we go.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.498
Hooah!
It's that tang that gets me.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.917
Hey, Meg, would you mind
- pulling over at this 7-
- Eleven?

04:11.001 --> 04:13.294
No doubt. I am the same way.

04:13.378 --> 04:15.255
Once I start thinking
about that hot case,

04:15.255 --> 04:17.215
I gots to pull over.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.806
I'll just do sex.
You don't need that.

04:24.806 --> 04:27.350
Wait right here.

04:28.393 --> 04:29.686
What the...

04:29.686 --> 04:32.772
What is happening right now?

04:37.402 --> 04:39.112
Damn it.
I should have just stayed home.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.697

Oh, you know, not much.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.716
All right, Mr. Quagmire,

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301
I understand
you have the hiccups.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.845
Now, it says here on your chart
you've tried "boo."

07:50.929 --> 07:53.098
Outside of that,
the best way to treat hiccups

07:53.098 --> 07:54.599
is through hypnosis.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.518
Yeah, hypnosis helps
with all sorts of stuff.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.688
This guy even helped me recover
a traumatic repressed memory.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.357
One front-row ticket
for Nickelback, please.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.650
The music was great,

08:03.650 --> 08:05.860
but I split my black jeans
during "Photograph."

08:05.944 --> 08:09.447
The bouncers had to carry me out
with a napkin over my ass.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.868
My mama always said that hiccups

it's Reverend Lucius.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.086
he's Whitney Houston's uncle.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.838
Is this the possessed one?

08:24.838 --> 08:28.258
Son, I'm now going to place
my hands on the afflicted area.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.802
Satan, release your grasp
from this man.

08:30.802 --> 08:33.138

about beating it?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.755
Can you pass me that retainer
in the cup holder?

10:10.443 --> 10:13.196
I have to wear it

10:13.196 --> 10:17.992

to get a B12 shot.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.521
Hi. I'm a bored white person
looking to waste $60?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.273
Well, I have a certificate

10:48.273 --> 10:50.066
from a probably, like,
three-day course

10:50.150 --> 10:52.235
that says I can inject people
with stuff.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.446
That needle's clean, right?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.072
You bet it is.

11:14.632 --> 11:16.843
Hey... I saw your TV was on

11:16.843 --> 11:18.219

11:18.303 --> 11:20.055
Geez, you look like hell.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.765
Listen,
I'm at the end of my rope here.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.475
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.810
Peyton Manning was accused
of assaulting a woman...

11:25.894 --> 11:27.354
and it just kind of went away.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.064
I need you to do something
for me, Peter.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.648
What is it? You name it.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.817
I don't want to live like this.
I need...

11:32.901 --> 11:34.819
I need you to kill me.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.529
What?! Quagmire,
I can't do that.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.406
You're-you're my best friend.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.283
If that's true,
then you'll... do it.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.910
You don't know
what it's been like.

11:41.910 --> 11:45.121
I can't remember the last time
I slept... 15 minutes straight.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.874
It's torture, Peter...
and it's driving me insane!

11:47.874 --> 11:50.377
Please... I'm begging you.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.549
Well, if it's really come
to that,

11:56.633 --> 11:59.594
if that's what you really want,
I'll do it.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.180
Oh, thank you, Peter.
And you have to do it.

12:02.180 --> 12:05.100
You can't let me out of it,
no matter how much I insist.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.810
It's done.
I'll come get you tomorrow.

12:06.810 --> 12:09.229

12:10.939 --> 12:12.691

12:41.720 --> 12:43.596

12:51.813 --> 12:54.190

I've been thinking about.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.818
- I'm talking huge.
- You're not...

12:56.818 --> 12:58.820
You're not seriously thinking
about robbing

12:58.820 --> 13:00.530
- Ross Dress for Less.
- Ross Dress for Less. Exactly.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.782
It's their Memorial Day sale
this weekend.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.617
- Big job.
- Big savings.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.703
That's Ross Dress for Less.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.705
Gonna need a hell of a driver.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.623
I knew I could count on you.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.042
What kind is this?

13:12.042 --> 13:13.418
It's French's.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.883
Oh, my God,
Meg's gonna commit a robbery.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.926
What am I gonna do?

13:22.010 --> 13:24.637
Chris is in distress?

13:24.721 --> 13:27.557
Herbert is in distress?

13:27.557 --> 13:29.642
Old turtle.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.901
Hey, Meg?

13:37.901 --> 13:39.819
I need to talk to you
about something.

13:39.903 --> 13:42.739
About Ross Dress for Less.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.075
What?
How do you know about that?

13:45.075 --> 13:46.659
I heard what you said
in the car.

13:46.743 --> 13:50.330
Meg, I think you're
very confused about something.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.165
Oh, what?
Wait, wait, let me guess.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.084
Seymour's just using me?

13:54.084 --> 13:56.878
Trust me, Chris,
I'm not confused about anything.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.590
- No, Meg...
- Stop spying on me, you little creep.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.926
Oh, man, I got to tell somebody.

14:02.926 --> 14:07.013
But first, let's have a look
at this sex toy drawer.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.604
Wow, big sex toy.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.732
And big savings. That's Hitachi.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.445
Goodbye, baby girl.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.531
Daddy's going away for a while.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.908
Ugh, I can't...

14:31.830 --> 14:33.373
Ow! Ouch!

14:33.373 --> 14:35.792
God, those claws
went right through my pants.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.502
Oh, my God.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.004
Oh, my God, they're gone.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.840
Kitty, you did it!
You broke the curse!

14:47.679 --> 14:49.639
Peter, no! They went away.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.474
- My hiccups are gone.
- Oh, no.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.227
That's exactly what you said
not to listen to.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.520
Peter, please!

14:55.520 --> 14:57.522
I swear, they're gone! Listen!

14:57.522 --> 15:00.191
Sorry, Quagmire. I promised
to take you out of your misery.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.985
And when I give my word
on something,

15:01.985 --> 15:03.194
I give it my all.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.405
Like when I guarded
Jeffrey Epstein.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.283
We would like to see prisoner.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.535
- On whose authority?
- Your mother.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.963
All right, I was able to hack
into the city's server.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.340
There's an accessible heat duct

15:23.340 --> 15:24.924
on the southwest side
of the building.

15:25.008 --> 15:27.719
If we set off an explosion here...

15:27.719 --> 15:29.971
Meg, I'm just gonna walk in
and point a gun at the cashier.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.598
Oh. Okay.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.684
Yeah. Yeah,
that-that should work.

15:40.565 --> 15:42.150
Yeah, we don't need
the timer, either.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.235
It won't be a factor
in anything I do.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.038
You okay back there, Quagmire?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.164
QUAGMIRE
Why do you care

15:56.164 --> 15:57.499
if you're just gonna
kill me anyway?

15:57.499 --> 16:00.293
We're still friends. Geez.

16:03.088 --> 16:06.549
That store is a disaster.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.677
The robes
are next to the hand weights.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.011
I mean, come on.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.304
Go, Meg! Let's go.

17:37.432 --> 17:40.226
We did it! Meg, that was...

17:40.310 --> 17:42.228
Wow.

17:44.606 --> 17:48.193
You're not just using me,
are you?

17:48.193 --> 17:49.736
What would give you that idea?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.112
I don't know.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.490
Just used to being hurt,
I guess.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.700
Meg, in addition to being

17:55.784 --> 17:58.620
the most kick-ass getaway driver
I have ever seen,

17:58.620 --> 18:01.122
I think you're
the most amazing person

18:01.206 --> 18:02.749
I've ever met.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.917
Really?

Meg, get out of here.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.674
- I'll take the heat for this.
- What? Why?

18:52.674 --> 18:55.677
Because you're my sister
and I love you.

18:55.677 --> 18:57.762
But what do we do about Seymo...

18:59.556 --> 19:00.682
What the...?

19:00.682 --> 19:02.976
Meg, there never was a Seymour.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.853
Think about it.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.522
Just hope you don't mind
going fast.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.233
Ooh. Big, flat butt, 11 o'clock.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.484
I got it.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.947
Oh, Seymour.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.498
Don't turn the wheel, please.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.460
I don't understand.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.670
I watched you
in front of Ross Dress for Less.

19:30.754 --> 19:34.257
You were just revving the engine
with your hand down your pants.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.800
Look,
whatever's going on with you,

19:35.884 --> 19:37.927
we're gonna figure it out.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.640
Thank you, Chris.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.477
What the hell?

19:45.477 --> 19:47.812
We'll talk later. Just go.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.565
Hey, you got to frickin' watch
where you're going, man.

19:50.565 --> 19:52.984
Chris?
What are you doing out here?

19:53.068 --> 19:54.903
Oh, y-you caught me.

19:54.903 --> 19:58.907
I, uh, I stole your car
and went on a joyride.

19:58.907 --> 20:01.451
Yeah!

20:02.494 --> 20:05.330
Chris,
I am very disappointed in you,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.082
and you are grounded,
and we will talk about this

20:07.082 --> 20:08.375
after I kill my best friend.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.466
Well, Peter,
I'm glad the gun jammed

20:16.466 --> 20:18.176
and Quagmire's still alive.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.886
Yeah, the gun definitely jammed

20:19.886 --> 20:21.763
and I didn't miss him
with all six bullets,

20:21.763 --> 20:24.349
- that's for sure.
- What are we gonna do about Meg?

20:24.349 --> 20:27.143
She's upstairs
having very loud sex

20:27.227 --> 20:28.561
with her imaginary boyfriend.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.064
