But why?

02:35.280 --> 02:37.157
What are they trying to tell me?

02:43.622 --> 02:47.125
It's been 34 years
since they arrived on this planet.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.795
And not a day passes that the survivors,

02:49.878 --> 02:53.006
forced to live in barrier cities,
do not live in fear.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
I have vowed to end that fear.

02:56.176 --> 02:58.762
I believe my dreams hold the key.

will I be in time to save the earth?

but we're getting her out.

do you think you're doing?

to wait for us much longer.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.932
[Gray] I understand that.

09:18.683 --> 09:19.934
It's in bad shape.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.271
[Ryan] Oh, please, tell me we're not
risking our necks for this plant!

09:23.354 --> 09:25.482
[Jane] I wouldn't even call it a plant,
it's a weed.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.152
- [Neil] I wouldn't even call it a weed.
- I need a minute to extract it.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.488
[Neil] Miss, that's a minute
we do not have.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.740
[Ryan] I'm afraid
he's right about that, ma'am.

to get out of here.

- [Neil] Captain?
- [Gray] Yes, Neil?

09:43.666 --> 09:46.187

with the "let's get out of here" thing.

why I shouldn't arrest you?

I am Dr. Aki Ross.
I have clearance to be here.

11:32.775 --> 11:35.004
[Gray] Not unlimited clearance.
And now without authorization.

I don't have time for this.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.258
[Gray] Do you realize you've just risked
the lives of my squad and me?

11:39.282 --> 11:41.802
[Aki] Look, I don't wanna talk about it.
The fact of the matter is,

11:41.826 --> 11:44.370
it was worth the lives of you
and your men.

- I think you're an idiot too.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.521
- [Neil] Very funny.
- [Gray] Well, I do wanna talk about it.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.047
Did it ever occur to you

11:54.130 --> 11:57.967
that maybe we would've volunteered to risk
our lives had we been given a choice?

11:58.051 --> 12:00.345
Well, nobody asked you to save me.

12:00.428 --> 12:03.097

You have not changed a bit!

[Man] Let's make sure of that, shall we?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.007
[Neil] I hate getting scanned.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.676
Sir, these scanners are probably worse
for us than the phantoms.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.428
No "probably" about it, captain.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.513
These machines are suspected
of causing sterility.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.516
And I want to have a little Neil Jr.
Calling me "daddy" someday.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.767
That's a spooky thought.

- Both.

I don't care what you think, doctor.

- We have to treat him. Now.
- I'm sorry, but that's impossible.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.521
We'll transfer him
to the treatment center.

for infestation.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.163
[Aki] Yeah, but the military's
impounded my ship.

- What's with her and the captain?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.292

Your little scene today broke
nearly every protocol.

18:08.296 --> 18:11.215
How long do you think this would have
survived outside the barrier?

18:11.299 --> 18:14.051
Aki, you know there are elements
in the council and military

18:14.135 --> 18:16.220
just waiting for an excuse
to shut us down.

18:16.846 --> 18:21.767
Look, 20 years ago, who discovered
this energy in the phantoms? You.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.769
And who proved the same energy source

18:23.853 --> 18:26.606
existed in humans and every life-form?

18:26.689 --> 18:30.276
You. You made it possible
to harness that energy

18:30.359 --> 18:32.653
for ovo-pacs, scanners, even the barrier.

18:32.737 --> 18:37.450
The council knows that. They trust you.
Doctor, we're so close to proving...

18:37.533 --> 18:39.785
But we still need this part.
And this one here.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.080
Exactly. Two more pieces
and we've solved the puzzle!

18:43.164 --> 18:45.625
And we need to be free
to find those pieces.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.418
I want to show you something, aki.

- What is this?
- Read.

18:51.756 --> 18:55.676
"All life is born of gaia
and each life has a spirit.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.554

- Doctor...
- Go on.

19:00.014 --> 19:04.685
"Through their experiences on earth,
each spirit matures and grows.

19:04.769 --> 19:07.271
When the physical body dies,

19:07.355 --> 19:12.485
the mature spirit, enriched by its life
on earth, returns to gaia,

19:12.568 --> 19:14.737
bringing with it the experiences...

19:15.613 --> 19:18.282
Enabling gaia to live and grow."

19:30.211 --> 19:31.379
They threw him in jail

19:31.462 --> 19:34.131
because he said the earth was not
the center of the universe.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.384
That could happen to us.

to attack the leonid meteor.

Now, I'd like to ask the director
of the bio-etheric center to speak.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.168
Dr. Sid, please.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.628
Thank you. [Clears throat]

21:36.545 --> 21:39.799
As you all know,
the phantoms' nest is in the leonid meteor

21:39.882 --> 21:41.842
that landed here 34 years ago.

21:42.718 --> 21:47.473
What you see now are the records
of every assault on the meteor to date.

21:47.556 --> 21:51.435
Physical attacks have had
utterly no effect.

21:51.519 --> 21:55.689
This scene took place three months ago
during a full-scale bombardment.

21:55.773 --> 21:59.985
Now, please note the phantoms outside
the meteor are indeed destroyed.

22:00.069 --> 22:04.114
However, inside,
many that were dormant come to life,

22:04.198 --> 22:08.118
and as you see,
overall phantom density remains the same.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.664
The newly risen aliens respond
to the attack

22:11.747 --> 22:14.625
by burrowing even deeper into the earth.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.545
Now, this is very interesting to me,
Dr. Sid,

22:17.628 --> 22:20.840
because we see
the same thing during surgery

22:20.923 --> 22:25.427
when using bio-etheric lasers
on phantom particles, do we not?

22:25.511 --> 22:26.929
Yes, indeed we do.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.015
You see, the injured particles escape,

22:30.099 --> 22:33.394
burying or digging themselves
deeper into a patient's body.

22:33.477 --> 22:38.065
And when we increase the laser power
to destroy these deeper particles,

22:38.983 --> 22:42.862
we have had incidents resulting
in further injury to a patient,

22:42.945 --> 22:45.656
and in some cases, death.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.492
And what exactly does that mean, doctor?

22:48.576 --> 22:51.161
It means there's a very good chance

22:51.245 --> 22:54.665
the beam from the Zeus Cannon will burn
the phantoms in the meteor.

22:54.748 --> 22:56.000
Exactly! Thank you.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.043
However, it also means

22:58.127 --> 23:02.590
that the beam energy may be too strong,
injuring the earth.

23:02.673 --> 23:04.341
Injure the earth?

23:05.175 --> 23:07.219
You mean, the gaia.

23:07.303 --> 23:10.264
- I mean...
- You mean, the spirit of the earth.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.640
[Dramatic music playing]

23:11.724 --> 23:16.228
- Yes, the spirit of the earth.
- [Council members murmuring]

23:16.312 --> 23:18.063
[Man] Did he just say
what I think he said?

23:18.147 --> 23:19.398
What are you doing?

23:19.481 --> 23:22.568
I know what I'm doing.
And whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.944
[Hein] This is ridiculous.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.071
Doctor, with all due respect,

23:26.155 --> 23:29.575
did you come here just to talk
about some gaia theory?

23:29.658 --> 23:32.411
To tell us that the planet is alive?

23:32.494 --> 23:34.204
That it has a spirit?

23:34.288 --> 23:37.249
That's a fairy tale. And I'm sorry,
but we don't have time for that.

23:37.333 --> 23:40.044
It is not a fairy tale. It is true.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.462
Ah. Oh.

23:41.545 --> 23:45.799
So if I point a gun at the earth and fire,

23:45.883 --> 23:49.470
I'm not just making a hole in the ground,
I'm killing the planet.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.972
Dr. Sid, the gaia theory
has not been proven.

23:52.056 --> 23:57.102
Even if gaia does exist, won't we still
have to remove the phantoms?

23:57.186 --> 24:00.439
I think if there's any chance of success,
we should take it.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.775
- Don't you agree?
- Of course I do.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.444
But there is an alternative
to the space Cannon.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.779
Another method?

24:06.862 --> 24:09.114
[Sid] Yes, a means of disabling
the phantoms.

24:09.198 --> 24:10.407
Please.

24:11.617 --> 24:15.371
As we know, the aliens display
a distinct energy pattern.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.167
Now, it is a fact
that two opposing bio-etheric waves

24:20.250 --> 24:23.128
placed one over the other
will cancel each other out.

24:23.212 --> 24:26.423
It is theoretically possible
to construct a wave pattern

24:26.507 --> 24:28.717
in direct opposition
to the phantom energy.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.179
We are currently assembling such a wave
and are nearing completion.

24:32.262 --> 24:33.973
Members of the council,

24:34.056 --> 24:37.309
gathering plants and animals
from around the world

24:37.393 --> 24:40.896
to fight the phantoms is utter nonsense.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.150
The Zeus Cannon is a proven,
effective weapon.

24:45.234 --> 24:48.070
It will kill phantoms.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.323
Can we afford to wait
for some crazy invention,

24:51.407 --> 24:55.828
some army of touchy-feely plants
and animals,

24:55.911 --> 24:59.039
an invention that offers no solid evidence
that it will destroy the aliens?

24:59.123 --> 25:00.416
There is evidence!

25:00.499 --> 25:02.876
Our partially completed energy wave

25:02.960 --> 25:05.713
has successfully stopped
phantom particles from spreading

25:05.796 --> 25:07.798
through a terminally infected patient.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.760
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence
that a terminal patient has been cured?

25:11.844 --> 25:15.180
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

25:15.264 --> 25:19.810
But we've succeeded in containing
the particles safely inside the patient.

25:19.893 --> 25:22.896
Ugh. Where is the proof?

25:23.439 --> 25:24.440
Here.

25:25.566 --> 25:26.567
[Beeps]

25:28.110 --> 25:31.405
[Council members gasping and chattering]

25:38.746 --> 25:42.374
[Sid] You may have bought us some time,
aki, but I wonder at what cost.

25:42.458 --> 25:46.378
Doctor, I can't keep hiding
in the background while you protect me.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.048
I want what life I have left
to mean something.

25:49.131 --> 25:52.676
You listen to me. When we find
the seventh and eighth spirits...

25:52.760 --> 25:55.888
If we find them.
What we need now is some luck.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.891
Luck has nothing to do with it.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.518
Faith and hard work, girl,

26:01.602 --> 26:04.688
'cause I'll be damned
if you're going to die before me.

26:23.457 --> 26:26.460
[Man over pa] All critical personnel,
report to level 14.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.006
[Door opens]

26:33.258 --> 26:36.178
The council decided to postpone firing
the Zeus Cannon.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.931
I guess I put on a good show.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.641
- Mind if I tag along?
- [Sighs]

26:40.724 --> 26:42.142
You'll probably get bored.

26:42.976 --> 26:44.978
[Man speaking indistinctly over pa]

26:55.531 --> 26:57.116
So, what are you doing?

26:57.199 --> 26:59.451
[Woman speaks indistinctly over pa]

27:00.202 --> 27:03.247
Oh, I see.
You're giving me the silent treatment.

27:04.164 --> 27:06.708
I'm scanning the city
for the seventh spirit.

27:10.003 --> 27:12.005
[Man speaking indistinctly over pa]

27:19.429 --> 27:20.556
[Ryan] Hurry up, Neil.

27:20.639 --> 27:23.159
- [Neil] Relax, sarge. I've almost got it.
- What do you think you're doing?

27:23.183 --> 27:25.269
We're just gonna strand them for a while.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.021
Hey, don't look at me, it was his idea.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.731
This was your idea?

27:29.815 --> 27:31.775
We're just helping
the captain out a little.

27:31.859 --> 27:33.859
Yeah, come on, Jane.
Where's your sense of romance?

27:33.902 --> 27:35.821
You've seen how the captain looks at her.

27:35.904 --> 27:36.989
[Grunts]

27:40.617 --> 27:42.161
It's amore, baby.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.330
What's going on?

27:45.873 --> 27:47.624
[Gray] It's probably just a glitch.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.628
- Listen, aki...
- Ah, I'm still mad at you.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.881
- You're mad at me?
- Leaving your helmet on.

27:53.964 --> 27:57.342
Not telling me who you were.
That doesn't seem a little childish?

27:57.426 --> 27:59.678
I was just upset when you just packed up

27:59.761 --> 28:01.847
and left for the Zeus station
without saying a word.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.810
Well, now you know
what was going on, all right?

28:03.891 --> 28:05.142
Yeah. Now I know.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.561
My operation had to be done
in zero grav, okay?

28:07.644 --> 28:08.854
Fine.

28:08.937 --> 28:12.149
How about the fact that I was sent there
on a job and you wouldn't even see me?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.860
I was probably helping Dr. Sid
collect spirit waves.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.695
- Well, now I know.
- So I'm sorry!

28:16.778 --> 28:18.780
Well, me too! So we're both sorry.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.783
[Sighs] Oh, boy.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.915
So will you tell me about them?

28:27.998 --> 28:29.708
About what?

28:29.791 --> 28:31.418
About the spirits you've collected.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.337
[Pensive music playing]

28:33.420 --> 28:36.423
I was infected by a phantom
during an experiment.

28:36.924 --> 28:38.926
Normally, no one could have survived.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.219
How did you?

28:40.302 --> 28:42.763
Dr. Sid created a membrane
around the infection,

28:42.846 --> 28:44.514
keeping me alive.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.558
So the first spirit wave was me.

28:47.351 --> 28:50.187
- The second was a fish.
- A fish?

28:50.270 --> 28:54.358
The third was a deer I found
in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.693
The fourth was a bird.

28:56.777 --> 29:01.031
Ever tried to track a sparrow
from outer space? It's no fun.

29:01.114 --> 29:02.954
What am I saying?
You probably would love that.

29:03.033 --> 29:04.159
I probably would.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.412
And then there was that plant
I collected from Times Square.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.414
- I thought that was number six.
- What?

29:09.498 --> 29:10.624
You skipped one.

29:13.961 --> 29:18.799
The fifth was a little girl dying
in a hospital emergency room.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.927
I retrieved the sample in time, but she...

29:24.680 --> 29:29.935
I told her everything had a spirit:
Dogs, cats, trees, little girls.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.103
Even the earth.

29:32.062 --> 29:35.941
I told her that she wasn't dying,
just returning to the earth's spirit,

29:36.024 --> 29:37.109
to gaia.

29:38.694 --> 29:43.991
She, uh, told me
that she was ready to die.

29:47.786 --> 29:51.498
She said I didn't have to make up stories
to make her feel better.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.463
Only 7 years old and ready to die.

29:58.547 --> 29:59.881
I'm sorry.

30:01.425 --> 30:05.971
I have work to do. I have to find
the seventh and eighth spirits.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.473
Don't, please.

30:09.224 --> 30:12.102
You don't believe any of this, do you?

30:12.185 --> 30:14.354
I just don't know, aki.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.902
Is this why you shut me out?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.155
You should have told me.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.284
I don't know how much time I have left.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.619
Who does?

30:32.331 --> 30:33.665
[Elevator starts]

30:35.167 --> 30:37.210
I better get back to scanning.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.882
[Man speaking indistinctly over pa]

30:43.925 --> 30:45.927
[Dramatic music playing]

30:51.975 --> 30:53.352
[Clears throat]

30:53.435 --> 30:54.686
Captain Edwards,

30:55.562 --> 30:59.900
you extracted a Dr. Ross from old New York
several days ago, did you not?

30:59.983 --> 31:03.362
- Yes, sir.
- What were your impressions of her?

31:03.445 --> 31:06.990
She seemed very capable
and determined, sir.

31:07.074 --> 31:11.036
You and the deep eyes
are being temporarily reassigned.

31:11.119 --> 31:14.790
You will guard Dr. Ross
when she reenters the wasteland.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.999
[Gray] Understood, sir.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.918
You don't understand yet, captain.

31:18.627 --> 31:22.964
Report any aberrant behavior in Dr. Ross
to the major immediately.

31:23.048 --> 31:24.383
Aberrant behavior, sir?

31:24.466 --> 31:26.885
The woman carries
an alien infestation, captain.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.763
We don't know what it may be doing to her.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.391
The alien presence could be
affecting herjudgment.

31:32.474 --> 31:35.644
They may be manipulating the doctor
for their very own purposes.

31:35.727 --> 31:39.439
Is the general suggesting
that Dr. Ross is a spy?

31:40.357 --> 31:43.944
The general is wondering why
he's explaining himself to a captain.

31:44.611 --> 31:47.614
She's had prolonged exposure
to phantom tissue.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.492
If this begins to manifest itself
in any way,

31:50.575 --> 31:54.955
Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest
and transported here for observation.

31:56.706 --> 31:59.960
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.

32:00.043 --> 32:01.169
Of course, sir.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.094
[Door closes]

32:09.177 --> 32:13.014
Major, send some of our men
to keep an eye on the good captain.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.620
[Heart beating]

33:49.027 --> 33:52.447
[Aki] I'm convinced that these dreams
are some form of communication.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.116
Their message still eludes me,

33:55.200 --> 33:58.662
but they're coming faster now
and that can only mean one thing.

33:59.913 --> 34:03.250
The phantoms inside me
are beginning to win.

34:03.333 --> 34:06.336
[Jane] Our target is 50 klicks
west of Tucson.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.356
- [Neil over radio] Roger.
- Phantom concentration?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.966
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.967
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

34:13.051 --> 34:17.013
Stick close to me. No heroics today, okay?
Everything by the book.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.889
By the book. Right.

34:25.563 --> 34:28.942
If we drop energy buoys here,
here and here,

34:29.025 --> 34:31.402
we should be able to land,
acquire the target and get out

34:31.485 --> 34:33.206
before the phantoms even know
we were there.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.489
And the buoys will attract the phantoms?

34:35.574 --> 34:37.534
- [Jane] Yeah.
- For a while.

34:47.252 --> 34:50.338
So you're from the 307th?
Under general hein?

34:50.422 --> 34:54.551
Ever done wasteland recon before?
It can get pretty ugly.

that line of wreckage.

I don't see how any living thing
could survive out here.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.506
We'll find out soon enough.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.594
[Ryan] This was
the phantom cleansing mission.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.721

36:55.797 --> 36:57.632
Hoping for life to return.

36:59.175 --> 37:00.885
[Ryan] Is that our spirit, doc?

37:17.986 --> 37:19.404
We're closing in on the life-form.

37:19.487 --> 37:23.950
- [Gray] Distance?
- Hard to say. We're very close.

37:24.617 --> 37:25.785
I don't see anything.

- That's impossible.

37:36.963 --> 37:38.965
[Ominous music playing]

37:43.678 --> 37:45.680
It's not the soldier, it's his ovo-pac.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.768
How do you explain that? The pacs power
our weapons, the barrier cities...

37:49.851 --> 37:51.728
I mean, it's just bio-etheric energy.

37:51.811 --> 37:55.356
And to create that energy we use
living tissue, single-cell organisms.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.520
You're telling me
his backpack is the seventh spirit?

37:58.443 --> 38:00.713
[Neil over radio] We have incoming.
Captain? Do you read me?

38:00.737 --> 38:01.738
[Gray] Say again?

38:01.821 --> 38:03.948
Do you read me, captain? We have incoming.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.950
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

but to relieve you of your command.

to Dr. Sid's wave theory

with the council, sir.

has opened the door for us.

in our midst and imploring us

for that task than yours, captain.

It seems Dr. Ross has been
recording her dreams.

She's gonna be fine.
But this is only temporary.

was attacked.

49:19.832 --> 49:21.208
Did I ever tell you that?

49:24.253 --> 49:28.257
I try to imagine
what that must have been like,

49:28.340 --> 49:31.886
seeing everyone around you fall over dead
for no apparent reason.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.736
What I realize, major,

50:30.819 --> 50:34.323
is that we must force the council
to take action against the enemy.

a few phantoms in a contained space.

Relax, major. When this night's over,
you're going to be a hero.

51:04.395 --> 51:05.396
[G ray] Aki, I don't...

51:05.479 --> 51:07.523
[Aki] But you were in my dream, gray.
You saw it.

51:07.606 --> 51:10.109
That's just it. I'm not sure what I saw.
How can you be?

51:10.192 --> 51:12.778
Captain, please, let her continue.

51:12.861 --> 51:16.657
All right, why do you think
we've never been able to determine

51:16.740 --> 51:19.076
a relationship
between the human-sized phantoms

51:19.159 --> 51:21.078
and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?

51:21.161 --> 51:25.040
Excuse me, doc,
but what frigging relationship?

51:25.124 --> 51:29.712
I mean, you got your human-sized phantoms,
and your creepy caterpillar-y phantoms,

51:29.795 --> 51:32.715
and your flying phantoms,
and let's not forget my personal favorite,

51:32.798 --> 51:34.425
the big, fat, giant phantoms.

51:34.508 --> 51:35.509
Down, boy.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.512
He's right. If you spent as much time
in the field as we have,

51:38.596 --> 51:42.224
you know there is no relationship.
It's like a zoo out there.

51:42.308 --> 51:46.061
Precisely. I think the giant ones
are like our whales or elephants.

51:46.145 --> 51:48.188
But why would an invading army bring

51:48.272 --> 51:50.608
a bunch of whales and elephants
along for the ride?

51:50.691 --> 51:53.193
Unless their ship was
some kind of a crazy Noah's ark?

51:53.277 --> 51:57.156
Hmm. We have always assumed
that the meteor

51:57.239 --> 52:00.534
was intended as a form of transportation.
Perhaps it wasn't.

52:00.618 --> 52:03.454
The meteor is a chunk of their planet
that got thrown into space

52:03.537 --> 52:04.997
when they destroyed their world.

52:05.080 --> 52:09.668
But how could they survive the trip
across outer space on a hunk of rock?

52:09.752 --> 52:10.836
They didn't.

52:14.006 --> 52:17.718
Whoa. This is all beginning
to make a creepy kind of sense.

52:17.801 --> 52:19.481
What do you think about all this, captain?

52:20.095 --> 52:23.057
I think that explains why
we never had a chance.

52:23.849 --> 52:26.852
All our strategies are based
on one assumption:

52:27.603 --> 52:30.648
That we were fighting alien invaders.

52:30.731 --> 52:33.692
Think of the dream, gray. How they died.

52:33.776 --> 52:36.695
Since then,
all they've known is suffering.

52:36.779 --> 52:38.781
They're not an invading army.

52:38.864 --> 52:40.324
They're ghosts.

52:42.660 --> 52:43.911
How many phantoms?

52:43.994 --> 52:45.930
[Elliot] More than enough
to convince the council, sir.

52:45.954 --> 52:49.500
Excellent. Sound an alert.
Send a squad out to eliminate them.

52:49.583 --> 52:50.501
Yes, sir.

and moving at incredible speed.

Major, what the hell is going on here?

53:02.012 --> 53:03.514
They're in the pipes.

53:03.597 --> 53:06.308
They're moving
with the bio-etheric energy flow.

53:06.392 --> 53:10.437
That's impossible. No living thing
could survive in those pipes.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.566
[Elliot] Well, we've got a big one
heading this way. Meta class, sir.

Now, you're our man. Think.

Captain, these walls are titanium alloy,
and the bars are pulse-Sonic lasers.

I can just wave a magic wand and...

55:30.077 --> 55:32.037
Deep eyes will take care of him. Come on.

[Phantom snarling]

[Suspenseful music playing]

55:40.254 --> 55:42.089
What's happening?
Why can we see them now?

55:42.172 --> 55:45.592
They must be carrying a residual charge
from passing through the barrier.

55:50.430 --> 55:51.431
Behind you!

56:02.776 --> 56:04.945
[Computer] Please stand clear of the door.

Please stand clear of the door.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.481
We need to find my ship.

58:04.564 --> 58:07.442
If it was towed inside the city,
it would be in the military hangar.

58:07.526 --> 58:09.361
That's a big "if."

58:09.444 --> 58:11.446

Look out!

58:20.872 --> 58:22.541
[Tires screeching]

58:27.295 --> 58:29.381
- Get us onto the platform.

[Tires screeching]

58:47.315 --> 58:49.276
Okay, now what?

58:49.359 --> 58:51.319
- We're going through the station.
- What?

58:51.403 --> 58:53.113
Captain, with all due respect...

58:53.196 --> 58:54.865
- Excuse me, captain.
- The station.

58:55.741 --> 58:57.159
We're going through it.

58:57.242 --> 58:58.660
It's the only way.

58:58.744 --> 59:02.622
So I gather this will be somewhat
of a rough ride?

59:02.706 --> 59:05.375
Doc, you've got a talent
for understatement.

59:05.459 --> 59:06.585
Hang on, everybody!

59:06.668 --> 59:08.670
[Tires screeching]

59:31.777 --> 59:32.778
Doc?

59:37.449 --> 59:38.450
Interesting.

59:39.201 --> 59:41.078
- Anybody hurt?
- Captain.

59:43.705 --> 59:44.998
[Dramatic music playing]

59:45.874 --> 59:47.959
Oh, god. Talk to me, sarge.

59:48.877 --> 59:50.045
Ouch!

59:50.128 --> 59:51.564
- Give me a hand, Jane.
- [Jane] Right.

59:51.588 --> 59:55.759
No, wait. We're risking further injury.
We need the proper tools to cut him out.

59:55.842 --> 59:57.010
They're in my ship.

59:58.178 --> 01:00:02.099
- [Grunts] No. No, doc. No drugs.
- Captain?

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:03.183
You heard the man.

01:00:04.392 --> 01:00:05.992
We'll find the ship and be back for you.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:07.938
- I'll stay with him.
- [Neil] Me too.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.356
Nobody's staying.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.859
- Just give me a gun.
- You got it.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:15.195
Give him a weapon. Do it!

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:19.491
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

01:00:20.283 --> 01:00:21.284
You hear me?

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:24.788
I hear you, captain. Now get out of here.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.123
Let's move out.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.010
A quad-axle atv. This is good.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:24.264
It can be used to retrieve Ryan
and transport him safely here.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:27.642
However, we'll need to replace
these spent fuel cells.

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.604
There could be some live ovo-pacs
in the hangar.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.773
All right, Jane, check the hangar.
Neil, get us ready for takeoff.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:35.942
Aki and Dr. Sid, prep the quatro.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:38.445
I'll go to the tower
and rotate the air tray.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.573
This city may be lost, but we are not.

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.467
Let's do this thing
and get the hell out of here.

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:00.235
Loud and clear, captain.

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:02.195

01:03:16.418 --> 01:03:18.545
Whoa, stop the air tray.
We have a problem.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:21.440
I'm reading an impound tractor is
still attached to the prow of the ship.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:23.091
Can you disengage it from the cockpit?

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:26.845
No, sir. Permission to go outside
and detach the coupling.

01:03:27.512 --> 01:03:28.638
[Gray] Do it.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:41.526
There's the problem.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:59.461
Jane, let me ask you something. You think
we're gonna get out of here alive?

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.463
I mean, I wonder
if anybody else has gotten out.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.758
- You think anyone's made it this far? Huh?
- Uh...

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.778
You think this eighth-spirit stuff is
really gonna work against the phantoms?

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:10.013
I mean, what if it's all a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo?

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:12.057
Ow! Jeez.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.560

I'm trying to concentrate here.

- [Gray] Neil, what's your status?
- Almost there.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:50.053
I want you two back inside.

We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating
with extreme prejudice.

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.129
I enlarged the scanning perimeter

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:48.090
to include an area
that we had previously overlooked.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.675
The impact crater.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:53.262
That's a strange place
to find the eighth spirit.

01:13:53.346 --> 01:13:55.097
Yes, really quite astonishing.

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:57.642
But nothing could survive in there
except phantoms.

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:58.935
Precisely.

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:02.438
Which suggests that the eighth spirit
is a phantom spirit.

01:14:02.521 --> 01:14:05.775
I can't explain it at the moment,
but once we get down there,

01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:09.362
- you will understand...
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:12.657
Yes. Yes, I expected
that's how you would evaluate our chances.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.951
- Well, am I wrong?
- No, no, no, I agree.

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:17.036
We probably won't live long enough

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.330
to extract the eighth spirit
from the crater.

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:21.040
Then why should we even try it?

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.209
Because we don't need
to extract the eighth spirit.

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:25.378
If we can't bring the final spirit here,

01:14:25.461 --> 01:14:28.172
we can go there
and complete the wave inside the crater.

01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:29.674
Yes, exactly.

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:31.801
And how do we do that, exactly?

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:34.178
I can construct a device

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:38.224
that would attach to aki's chest plate
to gather the eighth spirit and then...

01:14:39.850 --> 01:14:40.851
And then what?

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:44.397
And then we wait and see what happens.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.608
That's it? That's your plan?

01:14:47.692 --> 01:14:49.735
- We wait and see what happens?
- Yes.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:54.365
Oh, good. Well, I got my own plan.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.575
We keep scanning the surface from orbit,

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.995
and maybe we'll find
a compatible spirit somewhere else.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.079
Aki?

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.373

01:15:35.656 --> 01:15:38.909
Ah. I'm afraid
it was only a matter of time

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:42.038
before the phantoms developed
an immunity to our barriers.

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.207
But I am relieved to see
that you and the rest of the council

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:48.294

without incident.

Do you have it in sight, doctor?

There are so many of them.

Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit moving
along the crater's surface.

are you all right?

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.719
A little shaken. Stand by.

01:19:25.803 --> 01:19:30.057
Sid, the eighth spirit is not
on our scanner. Do you have it?

01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:32.351
The eighth spirit...

01:19:33.852 --> 01:19:35.145
Has been destroyed.

01:19:35.813 --> 01:19:39.775

- Nothing. This mission is over.

Aki, gray, can you hear me?

01:21:29.635 --> 01:21:33.555
Sid, I need to talk to the station.
Can you patch us through?

[Indistinct chatter]

[man 2] Incoming message, sir.

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:44.108
General hein,
you must cease fire immediately.

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.693
What you are looking at in the crater
is the living spirit

01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:48.695
of an alien's home world.

01:21:48.779 --> 01:21:51.490
Their planet was destroyed
and part of it landed here.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.326
This is not an invasion. It never was.

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:59.039
Oh, I see. And what have we been fighting
all this time, doctor? Ghosts?

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:03.794
Yes. Spirits that are confused,
lost and angry.

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:06.797
Oh, right. And these spirits are
coming out of this gaia thing.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.632
General hein, you have to listen.

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:12.469
Alien gaia, earth gaia. Doctor,
even if! Believed in such nonsense,

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:15.514
the fact remains the earth is
under attack from an aggressor

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:17.933
who must be destroyed at all costs.

01:22:18.016 --> 01:22:20.811
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

01:22:20.894 --> 01:22:23.772
Firing on the alien gaia
will only make it stronger.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:27.609
Since you are under the alien's influence,
doctor, I will take your protest to mean

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:30.612
that we are in fact pursuing
the correct course of action.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.948
So I suggest you take
your last few moments

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.284
and prepare to meet your gaia.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.495
Continue to fire
until the invader has been destroyed.

01:23:14.948 --> 01:23:17.326
General, the system is overheating, sir.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:21.413
We're going to hit it again and again,
and keep on hitting it until it's dead.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.225
But, sir, we're not even sure
if it's having any effect on the creature.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:27.836
No effect?
We've got them on the run, soldier.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.049
This is our moment of victory.
I order you to fire.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:34.092
The system won't allow us to fire again.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.511
We'll see about that.

Yes, it's gaia.

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:20.222
This is definitely not a good place to be.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:24.351
Hey. Are you all right?

01:24:24.434 --> 01:24:27.521

Go ahead, I'm still here.

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:17.029
We 're looking at gaia.
Do you hear me, sid? Gaia!

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:21.199
I think this explains why
the eighth spirit appeared here.

01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:25.746
Yes, that's it!

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:28.707
A phantom must have changed
into the eighth spirit

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.668
when it touched a new life
born from our own gaia.

01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:35.088
If so, it would've been given
a different energy signature

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:37.591
that set it apart from the other phantoms.

01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:38.675

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:42.054
You two could not have hoped
for a better location

Whatever you do, don't move.
Stay right where you are.

may not be as easy as it sounds.

[Sid] Don't shoot any of them!

01:25:56.318 --> 01:25:59.237
You could very well destroy our last hope.

01:25:59.321 --> 01:26:02.449
Then what do you suggest I do, doctor?
Ask them to play nice?

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:06.828
Combat strategy is your area
of expertise, captain, not mine.

01:26:07.954 --> 01:26:10.582
I have a reading here in the fissure.
Do you see it?

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:15.671
Yes! A compatible spirit.
It must be very near you.
