56:38.062 --> 56:39.562
Jesus, Kate,
l could have been

56:39.646 --> 56:42.023
a thousand times
the man l became.

56:42.107 --> 56:44.734
l could have been
one of the richest. . .
Forbes...

56:44.818 --> 56:46.527
How could you
do this to me?

56:46.612 --> 56:50.364
How could you
let me give up on
my dreams like this?

56:50.657 --> 56:52.575
Really, l want to know.

56:55.204 --> 56:56.454
Who are you?

56:57.498 --> 56:59.540
All right, look.
l'm sorry.

56:59.625 --> 57:00.666
(CLEARlNG THROAT)

57:00.751 --> 57:05.129
l'm sorry l was
such a saint before
and l'm such a prick now!

57:05.547 --> 57:07.423
But maybe l'm just not

57:07.508 --> 57:11.177
the same guy
that l was when
we got married.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.387
You know what?
Maybe you're not.

57:13.472 --> 57:18.768
Because the Jack Campbell
l married would not
need a $2,400 suit

57:18.852 --> 57:20.937
to feel better
about his life.

57:21.021 --> 57:23.523
But l'm telling you,
if that's what it's
gonna take, then buy it.

57:24.399 --> 57:28.194
Jesus! We'll take
the money out of
the kids' college fund.

57:28.278 --> 57:31.447
Forget it.
We'll get a funnel cake.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.367
lt'll be the highlight
of my week.

57:50.050 --> 57:53.010
Listen, l'm really
sorry about that
back in the store.

57:53.095 --> 57:54.720
l don't want to
fight with you.

57:55.097 --> 57:58.891
l just sometimes wonder
how we ended up here,
you know.

57:59.476 --> 58:02.979
l mean, back in college,
did you see us here?

58:04.481 --> 58:06.941
Life has thrown us
a few surprises.
l'll give you that.

58:07.025 --> 58:09.026
lt really has,
hasn't it?

58:09.987 --> 58:13.656
Yeah. So, if you had to,
what would you say
was the biggest surprise?

58:13.740 --> 58:15.658
Just out of curiosity.
l'm just asking.

58:17.744 --> 58:19.412
Well, Annie, for one.

58:20.372 --> 58:22.373
Surprise,
we're pregnant.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.417
Yeah, that must
have been. . .

58:24.501 --> 58:26.169
l mean, that. . .
That was.

58:26.253 --> 58:28.838
That was a very
unexpected moment.

58:28.922 --> 58:30.423
But what are you
gonna do? Mmm?

58:30.799 --> 58:33.176
l think it turned out
all right, don't you?

58:33.260 --> 58:35.303
Yeah. l really like Annie.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.388
Well, good, Jack.
Maybe we'll keep her.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.432
No, l love her.
l love Annie.

58:40.100 --> 58:41.267
l'm just. . .

58:43.187 --> 58:44.812
We had a lot of
good times, didn't we?

58:48.775 --> 58:51.402
Do you remember the place
on Charles Street
where we used to go?

58:52.487 --> 58:53.779
Charles Street?

58:56.033 --> 58:57.575
ln The Village?

58:58.410 --> 59:00.328
When we were living
in Greenwich Village.

59:00.454 --> 59:01.954
Yeah.

59:02.039 --> 59:04.415
Yeah, yeah.
Great times.
Great place.

59:05.292 --> 59:06.417
Why did we ever leave?

59:06.501 --> 59:08.002
You can't
really raise a kid

59:08.086 --> 59:09.921
in an apartment
in The Village.

59:10.005 --> 59:11.714
And then there
was the whole trek
out to the hospital.

59:11.798 --> 59:12.924
That didn't help either.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.887
You were great.

59:17.971 --> 59:19.639
l mean, surviving
the heart attack
was one thing.

59:19.806 --> 59:20.848
You had a heart attack?

59:21.141 --> 59:24.769
Hey, Jack, stop that.
'Cause l am. . .
l'm still mad at you.

59:26.313 --> 59:27.396
Who knows what
would have happened

59:27.481 --> 59:30.524
if you hadn't
stepped in
at the store.

59:31.652 --> 59:36.614
That's why l work
for Big Ed.

59:37.366 --> 59:38.407
Yeah.

59:41.078 --> 59:44.413
So, we had a baby,
Big Ed had a heart attack.

59:44.498 --> 59:47.333
Bought that house,
and l've been working
for him ever since.

59:47.918 --> 59:49.794
Sayonara, Wall Street.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.881
Our life in a nutshell.

59:54.967 --> 59:57.051
lf you want to
look at it that way.

59:57.594 --> 59:58.636
How would you
look at it?

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:04.850
A great success story.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.108
What do you say, Jack?
Show them how to do it, baby.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:13.901
All right, Jack,
we need a strike.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.612
Damn !

01:00:17.114 --> 01:00:19.073
Jesus, Jack.
What are you doing?

01:00:19.157 --> 01:00:20.574
lt's a league match,
all right?

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:23.077
Where's your
follow through?
Where's your stance?

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.871
You know what?
l'm doing the best l can.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:27.623
BlLL: lt's okay, Jack.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.251
ARNlE: Yeah, it's all right.
Look, why am l so competitive
all the time?

01:00:30.377 --> 01:00:32.795
You can still
pick up that spare.
Yeah, looking good.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.171
Take the spare.
Crack them, Jack!

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:35.464
Come on, Jack.
Here we go.

01:00:35.549 --> 01:00:36.549
Hurt them.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.301
BlLL: Come on, Jack.
Pick it up.

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:41.637
You're Jack Campbell.
You're better
than the sport.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:43.431
You shot the rapids
in Kenai.

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:45.016
You ran with the bulls
in Pamplona.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.350
You've jumped
out of an airplane

01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:47.810
over the Mojave Desert,
for Christ's sake.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.688
You can do this.
You can do this.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:01.574
Yes! Victorious!

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:04.577
Ha-ha? Ah-ha?

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.120
(LAUGHlNG)

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.497
Huh? All right!

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:09.915
High five!

01:01:11.043 --> 01:01:12.877
You're up.

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.170
Get them.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:25.806
Hi, Jack.

01:01:27.893 --> 01:01:28.934
Evelyn, right?

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:31.437
(LAUGHS) Very funny.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.189
l saw you out
on lane 20.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:34.690
You got the flu
or something?

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:36.859
Something like
that, yeah.

01:01:37.361 --> 01:01:38.527
Need a nurse?

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:41.655
Are you a nurse?

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:44.617
lf that's
what you want.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:46.786
Hey, wait a minute.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:49.747
Don't run away.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:53.876
Are we. . .

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:56.128
Are we what, Jack?

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.797
Well. . .

01:01:58.465 --> 01:02:00.341
ls there something
going on between us?

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:09.517
Are we finally
being honest?

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:12.395
lt would help me
if we were.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:15.022
Okay. You're right.

01:02:15.107 --> 01:02:17.900
We've been dancing
around this for years.

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:21.904
Here goes.

01:02:21.988 --> 01:02:23.239
When l get dressed
for a party,

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:25.908
and l know you're
gonna be there,

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.910
let's just say
l don't go strapless

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.954
because my husband
likes it.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:34.041
l've got six sets
of snow tires piled up
in my garage,

01:02:34.126 --> 01:02:36.627
and l won't even
drive in the snow.

01:02:37.796 --> 01:02:40.589
And our kids
just happen to be

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:43.134
in the same ballet
class every year.

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:48.180
So, if you're asking
whether l'd like it
to be more,

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:50.641
the answer's yes.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:53.561
Kate would never
have to know.

01:02:58.024 --> 01:02:59.859
Do l have your number?

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:04.655
Steve's out of town
with the kids this week.

01:03:05.574 --> 01:03:07.700
Why don't you
just stop by?

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:23.591
Hey, Jack.
You're all flushed.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:24.800
l feel good.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.302
Guess that 71 took
a lot out of you.

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:30.389
No. l just saw
Evelyn Thompson.

01:03:31.475 --> 01:03:32.558
She's relentless.

01:03:33.268 --> 01:03:34.810
She wants to have
an affair with me.

01:03:37.105 --> 01:03:38.272
She said that?

01:03:38.356 --> 01:03:39.440
Pretty much.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.233
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

01:03:41.902 --> 01:03:43.068
What is it about you?

01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:49.033
So, if you would write
her exact address
down there.

01:03:49.534 --> 01:03:50.618
You have a pen?
Please.

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:52.828
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on. Hold on a second.

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.830
You're not actually
thinking about cheating
on Kate, are you?

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:59.376
Well, it wouldn't
really be cheating,
Arnie.

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:02.922
lt's complicated.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:06.800
Maybe l haven't been
as good a consigliere
as you've been to me, okay?

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:07.927
But hear me out on this.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.095
Okay, a little flirtation
is harmless,

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.848
but you're dealing
with fire here,
all right, man?

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:16.185
The Fidelity Bank and Trust
is a tough creditor.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.605
You make
a deposit somewhere else,
they close your account.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.899
Forever, all right?

01:04:22.234 --> 01:04:24.109
Arnie, l don't want
your head to explode,

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:26.695
but l'm telling you,
those rules don't
apply to me.

01:04:26.988 --> 01:04:28.531
l'm not even. . .

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.991
l'm not talking
about rules, Jack,
all right?

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.159
l'm talking about. . .

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:33.827
You're. . .

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:37.998
There isn't a guy
in Union County who
wouldn't give his left nut

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.167
to be with Kate,
all right?

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:43.295
She's amazing,
and you're gonna
fuck it up.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.007
Just think about that,
all right?

01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:03.607
Hey, honey.
How was the game?

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:06.318
Long and boring
and generally pretty sad.

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.488
Arnie seemed
to enjoy it.

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:11.615
Sort of.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.868
Hey, where's that
chocolate cake?

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.664
Do you mean
this chocolate cake?

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.418
That's my piece.
l was saving it
because l got nauseated

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:25.087
by that
precooked mini-mall
rotisserie chicken.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.172
Mmm. Mmm.

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:29.133
lt's good.

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.594
Give me that cake.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.886
No way.

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:36.056
Come on.

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:39.101
l'm sorry.
lt's too important to me.

01:05:44.065 --> 01:05:45.482
(LAUGHlNG)

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.195
Ta-da!

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:53.115
l want that cake!

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.493
You want this cake?
l want it.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:57.703
(BOTH LAUGHlNG)

01:05:59.581 --> 01:06:00.664
Thank you.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:03.292
lt's good, right?
Uh-huh.

(LAUGHlNG)

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.971
Oh, God !

01:06:16.056 --> 01:06:17.890
Are the kids asleep?

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:19.933
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.992
Say it to me, Jack.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:38.077
What?

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:39.995
You know what
l like to hear.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.956
l know, baby.
l know what
you like to hear.

01:06:44.918 --> 01:06:47.127
Then tell me.
Tell me, tell me.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.130
You're a bad girl, baby.
You make me so hot.

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.424
What?

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:55.469
Not it?

01:06:57.347 --> 01:06:58.722
Nice, Jack.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:01.600
What?

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.143
Sweeping me
off my feet.

01:07:05.271 --> 01:07:06.897
You make me hot.

when I do that.

You want to come
to work with Dad,

l'll take them.

Oh, thank you.
You bet.

doing today?

Do you have
a tire like that?

l seem to
have some sort
of a blowout here.

take this one, Kenny?

Do l know you?
Not exactly.

01:23:42.226 --> 01:23:45.895
l've seen you on CNBC.
You look taller
in real life.

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:51.359
Truth is, Mintz was so busy
timing his wife's breathing,

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.236
he didn't realize
that Medtech

needed Global more
than the other way around.

01:23:55.489 --> 01:23:56.823
Ten days,
two weeks tops,

01:23:56.907 --> 01:23:57.949
they would have
approached you
with an offer.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.659
And l'm willing
to bet anything

01:23:59.743 --> 01:24:02.537
it would have been
1 30 billion, not 1 22.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.040
The trouble is, Peter,
you had a pussycat
running the show.

01:24:06.125 --> 01:24:08.459
What you needed
was a Doberman.

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:13.798
l'm impressed.
l really am.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:16.926
Now, about my car.

01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:21.931
Sure. We're gonna have
to special order that tire,

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:24.475
so it'll be ready
in a couple of days.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:29.105
All right. This is
my office address.

01:24:34.486 --> 01:24:36.988

drop off the car
yourself?

We're really more of

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:12.774
But you're not interested
in boutique dollars.

01:25:12.858 --> 01:25:13.941
l get it.

He's expecting you,
Mr. Lassiter.

Alan, this is
Jack Campbell,

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.241
the one l was
telling you about.

01:25:22.326 --> 01:25:25.077
Oh, of course.
Jack. Hi.

01:25:25.204 --> 01:25:26.829
Mr. Mintz.
No, no,
just call me Alan.

01:25:26.914 --> 01:25:30.541
We like to cultivate
a very casual atmosphere
around here.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:32.627
l can see that.

01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:35.379
Yes. What can l tell you?
Do you have kids?

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:38.841
Actually, yes.
Two of them.
Good ones.

01:25:38.926 --> 01:25:41.677
Great, great.
Why don't you
have a seat?

01:25:42.054 --> 01:25:46.224
Peter mentioned to me
that you're an avid
CNBC watcher.

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:48.518
But he didn't say
whether you had

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:51.229
any actual
Wall Street experience.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:56.359
l was a sales associate
at E. F. Hutton.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:25:59.153
A broker, really?

01:25:59.238 --> 01:26:01.656
And now you're in
the tire business?

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.908
That's right.
And auto supply.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.077
ln the retail end,
l understand.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:09.372
We get about 60%
of our business
from automotive service.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:14.043
And do you mind me asking
what kind of sales you did
in the last year?

01:26:14.127 --> 01:26:15.419
Just ballpark.

01:26:15.963 --> 01:26:17.922
We did 1 .7 million
in total revenue.

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:22.510
1 .7. That's great.
And what do you
project for this year?

01:26:22.594 --> 01:26:24.846
l think we're gonna
have a banner year.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.223
Sales are up almost 20%
in the first quarter,

01:26:27.307 --> 01:26:29.892
and we just landed
a major trucking
company account.

01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:31.519
You did?
lsn't that great?
That's terrific.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:33.396
So that puts you, what,
just a tad over 2 million?

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:37.108
That's right.
And that would make us
number one in our market.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:39.443
Excuse me. l'm gonna
get a glass of water.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:54.792
Look, l know our paltry
little $2 million
in sales

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.753
is about
what you spend a year
on office supplies.

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:00.131
And some regional
trucking company
account is nothing

01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:02.049
compared to
a multi-billion-dollar merger.

01:27:02.134 --> 01:27:03.175
No, no, no, no, no.

01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.969
l'm not trying to
knock the tire business.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.262
lt's okay, Alan.
l get it.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.307
l'm in your shoes,
l'm thinking exactly
the same thing.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:10.558
But here's the deal.

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:13.644
Business is business.
Wall Street, Main Street,

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:15.688
it's all just
a bunch of people
getting up in the morning,

01:27:15.772 --> 01:27:17.273
trying to figure out
how the hell

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:18.858

send their kids
to college.

01:27:18.942 --> 01:27:22.653
lt's just people,
and l know people.

01:27:23.322 --> 01:27:24.447
Oh, l'm sure you do.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.615
Take you,
for instance, Alan.

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:27.241
You have a certain
energy about you,

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.659
it's an active kind
of energy.

01:27:28.744 --> 01:27:31.621
l wouldn't be surprised
if you drank about
1 6 Diet Cokes a day.

01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:33.414
You're
an excellent father,

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:37.001
but you feel guilty
about the time you spend
away from home.

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:39.503
You drink bourbon,
but you offer
your clients scotch.

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:42.673
And your wife
decorated this office.

01:27:42.758 --> 01:27:43.966

01:27:44.051 --> 01:27:45.927
He certainly seems
to have your number.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.929
You're a little
tougher, Peter.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.222
For one thing,
you like expensive things.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:53.309
That's easy.
You've seen my car.

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.144
(CHUCKLES)

01:27:55.228 --> 01:27:57.438
You smoke
Hoyo de Monterreys.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:28:00.608
You're a scotch man,
single malt,
not because it's trendy,

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:03.069
but because
you've been doing it
for the last 40 years

01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.570
and you like to
stay with what works.

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:08.950
You have two great
loves in your life,
your horses

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.701
and this company.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:13.621
And you're a man
who prides himself

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.915
in finding talent
in unusual places.

01:28:17.542 --> 01:28:18.876
How would you
know that?

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.461
Because l'm here.

01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:23.422
l'm prepared to do
whatever it takes
to get this job.

01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:25.174
l'll start wherever
l have to start.

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:27.343
l'll park cars
if l have to.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:28.761
The biggest part
of judging character

01:28:28.845 --> 01:28:31.013
is knowing yourself,
and l know this:

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:34.183
l can do this job.
l can.

01:28:34.977 --> 01:28:37.979
Give me a chance, Peter.
l won't let you down.

01:28:43.902 --> 01:28:47.238
Alan, why don't
you show Jack around?

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.992
This is our war room.
We did seven major deals
in here last year,

01:28:51.076 --> 01:28:53.160
three of them hostile.

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:54.662
Seven?
Yeah.

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:56.038
You get a kind
of a feeling from. . .

01:28:56.123 --> 01:28:57.498
Can we cut the shit here
for a minute?

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:59.166
What did you do?
Where did you get
that information?

01:28:59.251 --> 01:29:00.251
Did you go
through his wallet?

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.794
Did you surf some Net?
Something like that?

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:04.839
lt doesn't really matter
because that circus act
you pulled back there

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:07.341
may have dazzled Lassiter,
but it doesn't cut
any shit with me at all.

01:29:07.426 --> 01:29:09.677
Even if you get this job,
which l highly doubt,

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:11.220
let me just give you
just a little word
of warning.

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:15.307
Peter Lassiter gets tired
of his pet projects very,
very, very quickly.

01:29:15.392 --> 01:29:16.517
l've got that
big office in there

01:29:16.601 --> 01:29:19.353
because l prove myself to him
year after year after year.

01:29:19.438 --> 01:29:20.521
And nobody is
gonna come in here

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:21.605
and turn
the old man's head,

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:24.900
especially not
some tire salesman
from New Jersey.

01:29:25.235 --> 01:29:27.570
So if you're cautious
and you're quiet,

01:29:27.654 --> 01:29:29.071
you watch yourself,
you stay away
from Lassiter,

01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:30.698
and maybe l'll think
about keeping you
on here

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:33.784
after he gets bored
with you.

01:29:34.036 --> 01:29:35.286
Do we understand
each other?

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:36.996
(LAUGHlNG)

01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:38.122
Alan !

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:41.250
God, you really
are different,
aren't you?

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:42.376
Excuse me?

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:43.878
l mean, wow!

01:29:43.962 --> 01:29:47.798
l'm impressed.
l'm impressed.
Good for you.

01:29:50.135 --> 01:29:52.261
Are we understanding
each other?

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:54.263
Yes, Alan,
l understand you.

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:55.389
Okay, then.

01:29:55.474 --> 01:29:56.474
Good.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.727
Good.
Okay. Okay.

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:01.771
Alan !

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.740
Keep your eyes closed.
Hold on.

01:30:13.617 --> 01:30:14.825
(LAUGHS)

01:30:16.787 --> 01:30:18.788
Go ahead.
Open your eyes.

01:30:19.331 --> 01:30:20.998
Welcome to Xanadu.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:27.046
lt's pretty incredible,
isn't it?

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:28.422
lt's like a museum.

01:30:28.507 --> 01:30:29.757
Uh-huh.

01:30:34.346 --> 01:30:35.679
Look around.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.190
So what's
the big surprise?

01:30:47.025 --> 01:30:48.859
You didn't rent this
for the weekend, did you?

01:30:49.569 --> 01:30:51.695
Think bigger.

01:30:53.031 --> 01:30:54.073
For the week?

01:30:54.407 --> 01:30:55.950
This place
is a perk, Kate.

01:30:59.079 --> 01:31:00.704
A perk?
Mmm-hmm.

01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:03.249
For what?

01:31:03.708 --> 01:31:06.794
A company called
P. K. Lassiter
lnvestment House

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:09.713
uses it to
attract new executives.

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.341
l'm going into
arbitrage, honey.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:14.844
lt turns out
l have a knack for it.

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:18.973
Jack, what are
you talking about?

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.475
l'll be making twice
what l make now,

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:24.019
plus a hefty bonus.
And that's just a start.

01:31:24.104 --> 01:31:27.481
And we can live
in this apartment
practically rent free

01:31:27.566 --> 01:31:29.984
until we find

you possibly be

this is New York City.

into the city, Jack.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.764
l thought the reason
that we left

01:32:00.849 --> 01:32:02.516
was because we didn't want
to raise the kids here.

01:32:02.601 --> 01:32:05.811

Life has thrown us
a few surprises,

01:32:47.354 --> 01:32:49.104

Well, guess what?

and we don't know which one.

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.679
And they're gonna let Bob
buy a minority stake,

01:47:57.763 --> 01:48:00.598
and, at the same time,
let him keep running
the entire company.

01:48:00.683 --> 01:48:01.766
And Global knows, Jack.
They know.

01:48:01.851 --> 01:48:02.892
l don't know
how they know,
but they know.

01:48:02.977 --> 01:48:04.811
And they're up in arms.

01:48:04.895 --> 01:48:06.980
And they think, somehow,
we should have been
prepared for this.

01:48:07.064 --> 01:48:08.231
(CHUCKLES) Prepared !

01:48:09.024 --> 01:48:10.900
Oh, God,
we're in trouble.

01:48:11.735 --> 01:48:13.736
You know something,
Alan?

01:48:14.238 --> 01:48:15.989
Somewhere
inside of you,

01:48:16.073 --> 01:48:18.741
there's a much more
assertive person.

01:48:19.326 --> 01:48:22.704
ls this another
one of those Sun Tzu
Art of War tricks?

01:48:22.872 --> 01:48:23.913
(LAUGHS)

01:48:23.998 --> 01:48:25.039
No.

01:48:26.167 --> 01:48:28.084
So, what are we
gonna do, Jack?

01:48:30.129 --> 01:48:31.254
Jack?

01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:36.176
l'll tell you exactly
what we're going to do.

01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:39.012
You're going to do
whatever you have to do
to find out

01:48:39.096 --> 01:48:41.931
which European company
he's been talking to.

01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:44.434
Then l'm going to
clean myself up,

01:48:45.102 --> 01:48:49.147
fly to Aspen
and drink eggnog
with Bob Thomas.

01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:51.524
His wife and kids
will be playing

01:48:51.609 --> 01:48:53.818
in the background,
in the snow,

01:48:53.903 --> 01:48:58.156
while l convince him
that the European company
is the devil

01:48:58.949 --> 01:49:01.242
and Global
is the answer
to his prayers.

01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:06.122
Then l'm gonna
spend four hours
skiing, alone.

01:49:07.583 --> 01:49:11.044
Completely and
utterly alone.

01:49:13.964 --> 01:49:17.550
l'm going to do that
because that is my life.

01:49:17.635 --> 01:49:21.638
That's what's real,
and there's nothing
l can do to change that.

01:49:40.324 --> 01:49:41.824
For Manhattan.

01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:43.993
Kate Reynolds.

01:49:49.333 --> 01:49:50.959
l need an address, too.

01:50:16.068 --> 01:50:18.820
lt's very fragile,
so l want you to be
very careful with it, okay?

01:50:18.904 --> 01:50:21.239
lt's valuable.
lt's over 300 years old.

01:50:21.323 --> 01:50:22.615
You'll probably need
a few guys to carry it.

01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700
MAN: All right.

01:50:23.784 --> 01:50:28.121
LORl: And the painting
is also very, very old,
so take extra care.

01:50:28.205 --> 01:50:31.332
lt means a lot
to Kate, okay?
l appreciate it.

01:50:32.501 --> 01:50:34.085
Yeah? What?

01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:36.212
Are you from
the moving company?

01:50:36.297 --> 01:50:40.174
l'm Jack Campbell.
l'm an old friend
of Kate's.

01:50:41.719 --> 01:50:43.303
Kate, some guy is here.

01:50:43.387 --> 01:50:45.972
KATE: Hey, Lori,
did you call the airline
like l asked you to do?

01:50:46.056 --> 01:50:48.558
lt's like
two hours. . . Jack.

01:50:49.393 --> 01:50:50.435
Kate.

01:50:50.853 --> 01:50:53.271
God, it's been
a long time.
You look. . .

01:50:53.522 --> 01:50:54.564
You look great.

01:50:55.107 --> 01:50:56.149
Thanks.

01:50:58.402 --> 01:51:00.695
l. . . Come on in.
Come on in.

01:51:00.779 --> 01:51:04.073
l'm just doing some. . .
Lori, do you know
where those boxes are?

01:51:06.869 --> 01:51:07.869
l'm sorry.

01:51:07.953 --> 01:51:10.371
No, no, no, no!
You know what. . . Jack.

01:51:10.581 --> 01:51:12.665
Don't. . . Please.
l don't even care.

01:51:12.916 --> 01:51:15.043
Oh, great. Thank you.

01:51:16.670 --> 01:51:17.712
What's going on?

01:51:17.796 --> 01:51:19.297
l'm moving to Paris.

01:51:19.673 --> 01:51:21.674
Hey, Lori,
have you seen that box?

01:51:21.759 --> 01:51:22.925
lt says "Jack" on it.

01:51:23.010 --> 01:51:25.887
And l put it
with the rest of
the Salvation Army stuff.

01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:28.181
Do you want me to
look for the box or
call the airline, Kate?

01:51:28.265 --> 01:51:30.266
Hey, kind of under
a little pressure here.

01:51:30.601 --> 01:51:33.853
Hey, kind of
giving up Christmas day
for my ex-boss here.

01:51:33.937 --> 01:51:36.064
Hey, didn't seem to
mind offering to help

01:51:36.148 --> 01:51:38.316
when she was
opening the Prada bag
l gave her.

01:51:39.401 --> 01:51:41.110
Maybe it's by
the wardrobe boxes.

01:51:41.612 --> 01:51:43.071
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:51:43.947 --> 01:51:45.031
So you're moving.

01:51:45.449 --> 01:51:46.824
Yeah, to Paris.

01:51:46.909 --> 01:51:50.203
My firm has an office there.
l'm gonna be heading it up.

01:51:50.954 --> 01:51:52.955
Paris. Paris, France?

01:51:53.499 --> 01:51:55.041
That's the one.

01:51:56.710 --> 01:51:59.003
So, you're. . . You're
not at a nonprofit firm?

01:51:59.588 --> 01:52:01.881
(LAUGHS) God, no,
not with what
they pay me.

01:52:03.217 --> 01:52:04.384
Are you married?

01:52:05.469 --> 01:52:07.970
No, l never got
married, Jack. You?

01:52:08.472 --> 01:52:09.889
Not exactly.

01:52:11.141 --> 01:52:13.267
Look, could we
take a minute here,

01:52:13.352 --> 01:52:15.144
maybe go get a cup of
coffee or something?

01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:16.604
l'll go for a cup
of coffee.

01:52:16.772 --> 01:52:19.107
Yes. l found it.

01:52:19.191 --> 01:52:21.901
Congratulations.
Your earlier flight
was canceled,

01:52:21.985 --> 01:52:24.570
but l got you
out of Kennedy
on United at 7:00.

01:52:24.655 --> 01:52:25.655
Excellent.

01:52:25.739 --> 01:52:27.031
Am l good or what?

01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:28.950
Yes, you're brilliant.

01:52:29.034 --> 01:52:30.368
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:52:30.452 --> 01:52:32.829
Here you go. lt's just
some old stuff of yours.

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:37.333
Do you ever think
about us, Kate?

01:52:38.544 --> 01:52:40.128
About what might
have happened?

01:52:46.593 --> 01:52:47.718
Jack, l'll tell you what.

01:52:47.803 --> 01:52:49.595
lf you're ever in Paris,
l want you to look me up

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:51.722
and we'll go have
that cup of coffee, okay?

01:52:51.807 --> 01:52:53.766
Or cafÃ©. Or cafÃ© au lait.

01:52:53.851 --> 01:52:55.685
Oh, wait.
No, no, no, no!

01:52:55.769 --> 01:52:59.439
Don't close that up.
l will never find
this box again.

01:52:59.565 --> 01:53:01.023
LORl: l marked it, okay?
'Cause l need you
to leave it.

01:53:01.108 --> 01:53:02.942
Just be more
specific next time.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.072
LORl: Okay,
we'll leave it open then.

01:53:08.157 --> 01:53:09.407
l was just trying
to close it up, so. . .

01:53:09.491 --> 01:53:10.533
KATE: Don't.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.624
Make a right here.

01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:21.377
DRlVER: Sir, you're gonna
be late for your flight.

01:53:21.462 --> 01:53:23.754
We're not going
to the airport.

01:54:51.969 --> 01:54:53.886
You can't
leave this here.

01:54:53.971 --> 01:54:55.721
You can't park here!

01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:22.665
Kate! You can't go.

01:55:23.292 --> 01:55:24.333
Don't get on that plane.

01:55:24.418 --> 01:55:25.459
Jack?

01:55:25.544 --> 01:55:29.005
Please, let's just go
have a cup of coffee.
That's all l'm asking for.

01:55:29.548 --> 01:55:32.049
l'm sure there's
another flight to
Paris tonight.

01:55:32.593 --> 01:55:36.095
Jack. What are
you doing here?

01:55:40.684 --> 01:55:42.518
Do you need closure?

01:55:42.811 --> 01:55:45.479
Because if you do
after all these years,
you got it.

01:55:45.564 --> 01:55:46.856
l'm okay.

01:55:47.608 --> 01:55:48.858
l'm fine.

01:55:50.694 --> 01:55:53.863
l. . . l was
heartbroken, Jack,

01:55:53.947 --> 01:55:56.449
but l got over it,
l moved on.

01:55:56.533 --> 01:56:01.579
And you should
move on, too.

01:56:02.873 --> 01:56:04.540
Okay? l'm sorry.

01:56:04.625 --> 01:56:07.209
l just can't. . .
l've gotta go.

01:56:08.378 --> 01:56:11.547
l'm sorry, Jack.
l'm sorry. Excuse me.

01:56:16.887 --> 01:56:19.221
Can l just. . .
l'm sorry.
l was here.

01:56:31.401 --> 01:56:32.735
We have a house
in Jersey!

01:56:36.406 --> 01:56:38.032
We have two kids.

01:56:38.116 --> 01:56:39.659
Annie and Josh.

01:56:40.494 --> 01:56:44.288
Annie's not much
of a violin player,
but she tries real hard.

01:56:44.456 --> 01:56:46.123
She's a little precocious,

01:56:46.208 --> 01:56:48.918
but that's only
because she says
what's on her mind.

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:51.712
And when she smiles. . .

01:56:55.092 --> 01:56:58.260
And Josh,
he has your eyes.

01:56:59.554 --> 01:57:02.431
He doesn't say much,
but we know he's smart.

01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:04.725
He's always
got his eyes open.

01:57:04.810 --> 01:57:07.353
You know, he's
always watching us.

01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:10.106
Sometimes you can
look at him

01:57:10.190 --> 01:57:13.192
and you just know
he's learning
something new.

01:57:14.611 --> 01:57:16.904
lt's like witnessing
a miracle.

01:57:17.906 --> 01:57:20.449
The house is a mess,
but it's ours.

01:57:21.451 --> 01:57:24.537
After 1 22 more payments,
it's going to be ours.

01:57:25.789 --> 01:57:29.458
And you, you're
a nonprofit lawyer.

01:57:30.293 --> 01:57:33.546
That's right. You're
completely nonprofit.

01:57:34.548 --> 01:57:37.091
But that doesn't
seem to bother you.

01:57:38.760 --> 01:57:40.428
And we're in love.

01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:43.139
After 1 3 years
of marriage,

01:57:43.223 --> 01:57:45.474
we're still
unbelievably in love.

01:57:46.935 --> 01:57:50.146
You won't even
let me touch you
till l've said it.

01:57:51.231 --> 01:57:52.398
l sing to you.

01:57:53.316 --> 01:57:56.777
Not all the time,
but definitely on
special occasions.

01:57:57.404 --> 01:57:59.530
And we've. . .
We've dealt
with our share

01:57:59.614 --> 01:58:01.907
of surprises
and made a lot
of sacrifices,

01:58:01.992 --> 01:58:03.868
but we stayed together.

01:58:04.995 --> 01:58:06.454
You see,

01:58:08.165 --> 01:58:10.541
you're a better
person than l am,

01:58:11.543 --> 01:58:14.670
and it made me
a better person
to be around you.

01:58:16.214 --> 01:58:18.924
l don't know. Maybe it
was all just a dream.

01:58:19.009 --> 01:58:21.469
Maybe l went to bed
one lonely night
in December

01:58:21.553 --> 01:58:25.389
and l imagined it all,
but l swear,

01:58:25.474 --> 01:58:27.183
nothing's ever
felt more real.

01:58:30.353 --> 01:58:32.062
And if you get on
that plane right now,

01:58:34.357 --> 01:58:36.317
it'll disappear forever.

01:58:39.988 --> 01:58:43.616
l know we could both
go on with our lives
and we'd both be fine.

01:58:44.493 --> 01:58:48.162
But l've seen
what we could
be like together.

01:58:52.417 --> 01:58:54.043
And l choose us.

01:58:57.047 --> 01:58:58.506
Please, Kate.

01:58:59.674 --> 01:59:01.342
One cup of coffee.

01:59:02.052 --> 01:59:04.136
You can always
go to Paris.

01:59:04.763 --> 01:59:06.972
Just, please,

01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:10.226
not tonight.

01:59:20.695 --> 01:59:22.238
Okay, Jack.

01:59:27.911 --> 01:59:29.245
Okay.
