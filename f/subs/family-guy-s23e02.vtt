Oh, hi, you guys. How was school?

00:37.996 --> 00:39.164
Eh, it was fine.

00:39.247 --> 00:42.709
But we had a substitute bully today
and he was doing it wrong.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.544
Okay, it says "tape sign on back."

00:44.627 --> 00:46.671
Is that... Is that your back, my back?

00:46.755 --> 00:49.632
I-I got to be honest,
I only got called in 45 minutes ago.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.469
[sighs] Just pinch my nipples
and get out of here.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.721
We need you to
sign these permission slips.

00:54.804 --> 00:57.307
We're taking a school field trip
to Washington DC.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.268
Great, bring 'em here
and I'll give you my John Hancock.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.979
-Who's that?
-I'm sorry, I mean my Lane Bryant.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.939
Well, just say that, then.

01:09.110 --> 01:13.698
Big day, gentlemen. It's the one day
a year Peter eats a salad.

01:13.782 --> 01:17.202
Poor bastard. No one should have to
go through that hell.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.580
He made a promise to Lois.
It was actually in their wedding vows.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.333
All right, let's get this over with.

01:23.416 --> 01:26.586
I brought the whitest-looking lettuce
from McDonald's I could find.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.214
I'm hoping it has McNugget
smell accidentally on it.

01:29.297 --> 01:33.301
I brought today's newspaper like you asked
so you'd have proof of salad.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.303
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Got it.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.144
I love my wife. I love my wife.

And inside this local tavern,

01:58.910 --> 02:02.372
a portly gentleman has just consumed
his annual salad.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.832
I'm Garrison Keillor,

02:03.915 --> 02:09.170
and I was "MeToo'd" for quaintly groping,
so now I'm doing this.

02:13.758 --> 02:17.220
So, Chris, Meg, you guys excited
for your big trip to Washington DC?

02:17.303 --> 02:20.181
Yeah. The cool kids are
bringing a candy-colored version

02:20.265 --> 02:23.351
of whatever drug the media is
most freaking parents out about.

02:23.434 --> 02:25.061
-What?
-Relax, Mom.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.605
We're being supervised
by public school employees

02:27.689 --> 02:30.817
who themselves are battling
their own crippling addictions.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.318
Peter, are you hearing this?

02:32.402 --> 02:35.321
I'm not. I'm chewing Cap'n Crunch,
I can't hear anything.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.073
[loud crunching]

02:37.157 --> 02:40.410
I just worry,
but I guess that's what moms do.

02:40.493 --> 02:44.289
Well, that and give you a recap of
everyone who's died that you don't know.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.291
You know, Leonard died.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.876
-Who?
-Leonard.

02:47.959 --> 02:50.295
-Okay.
-Estelle's pretty upset.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.505
And right on the heels of Abner.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.091
-Uh-huh.
-You should probably call Edith.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.010
I'll give you Alfred's number.

02:57.093 --> 02:58.803
Who the hell are these people?

02:58.887 --> 03:01.764
Is this just an excuse

Huh.

03:31.794 --> 03:33.463
What's the matter?
You look upset.

03:33.546 --> 03:37.467
Eh, it's just, Joe's been pretty stingy
with his "ha ha's" over text.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.677
I think you're probably
reading into that.

03:39.761 --> 03:43.473
No, seriously. Cleveland sends some
lame crap and Joe "ha ha's" it.

03:43.556 --> 03:47.227
I send a photo of me hanging a foreclosure
notice over a toilet, nothing.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.979
I'm telling you, he never laughs
at anything of mine.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.106
He must have given you
one at some point.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.775
I mean, sure, at some point.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.685
Oh, my God.
He's literally never given me one.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.395
Joe doesn't think I'm funny?

04:30.478 --> 04:33.481
Oh, thank God you're here.
You know funny when you hear it.

04:33.564 --> 04:37.402
Hey, Ostrich, did you hear that crazy
story about the monkey's favorite food?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.153
It's bananas.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.613

[indistinct conversations]

Hey, gang, I know you're not used to
seeing your teachers in shorts,

04:51.416 --> 04:54.335
They're just legs, guys.
Oh, one more thing.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.213
We do have a surprise chaperone
for this trip.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.925
Everyone say hi to
Chris and Meg's mom, Lois Griffin.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.303
Aah! Woot, woot!

05:03.386 --> 05:06.264
Did somebody say "cool mom
with an Activia fanny pack"?

05:06.347 --> 05:08.975
They give you a free one
if you send in enough lids.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.519
I've got two fanny packs
and a very healthy colon.

05:12.061 --> 05:14.355
[both] Our chaperone is Mom?

05:14.439 --> 05:18.359
You're lucky. My mother died last year
after a long illness.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.530
You got your GoFundMe money,
so shut up!

05:29.329 --> 05:31.748
Mom, what the hell
are you doing here?

05:31.831 --> 05:33.833
Are you trying
to kill our reputation?

05:33.916 --> 05:37.754
Oh, relax, you two.
I'm gonna be the cool mom, huh?

05:37.837 --> 05:40.506
I may even have the kids
call me Mrs. G.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.467
[laughs] Mrs. G.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.760
Can you imagine?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.179
Just like Mrs. Garrett
from The Facts of Life.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.097
Nobody knows who that is.

Just settle down, you guys.
I promise I won't embarrass you.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.275
Okay, everyone, I've got candy.

Everybody reach in
but just take one.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.617
Oh, my God, this is terrible.

06:07.700 --> 06:11.496
This is more embarrassing
than when I tried to return that RealDoll.

06:11.579 --> 06:15.917
Uh, yes, hello, I would
like to return my RealDoll.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.961
[woman on phone] Okay,
and what condition is the doll in?

06:19.045 --> 06:21.923
Um, let's say "fair."

06:22.006 --> 06:24.509
-Any visible marks?
-Some light choking.

06:24.592 --> 06:27.345
We can't take the doll back
if there are choke marks.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.722
Oh, no, no, no,
the choke marks are on me,

06:29.847 --> 06:32.517
and in her defense,
I did have it coming.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.852
Actually, I don't
want to return the RealDoll.

06:34.936 --> 06:36.604
This is just part of the dance.

06:36.687 --> 06:40.441
Oh, no. I didn't realize
you were there the whole time.

06:40.525 --> 06:43.653
I hope I'm not in for some light choking.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.617
Why do you even care if Joe's never
laughed at your texts?

06:49.700 --> 06:53.371
Brian, I know it seems like
I have it all, but even I,

06:53.454 --> 06:57.959
a man with 15 Halloween masks,
have my struggles with insecurity.

06:58.042 --> 06:59.502
So, what are you gonna do?

06:59.585 --> 07:02.088
I decided to give him
a taste of his own medicine.

07:02.171 --> 07:06.217
From this day forward, I will never laugh
at another one of Joe's texts.

Phew, that was close.
I was almost gay.

-Mom, don't, please.
-Quiet, Meg.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.132
So, I saw a really funny TikTok.
Do you know that one?

07:46.215 --> 07:49.302
You're gonna have to be
more specific. Which one?

07:49.385 --> 07:51.721
Uh, there's-there's more than one?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.306
Why is everyone leaving?

You're lame
and we don't want to be with you.

let's go watch CNBC in the lobby.

Just be thankful
this isn't your entire life.

and someone you love.

Oh, come on, I'm sure there's
someone special in your life.

08:26.297 --> 08:28.841
You know, there was someone.

A long time ago.

08:32.303 --> 08:35.932
It was 1993,
and I was folding clothes at a Structure.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.433
Everyone was, back then.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.352
Then I saw her.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.812
Shelly Barnes.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.564
Boy, was she something.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.944
Tall, tan. She was more scrunchie
than woman.

We wanted the dream:

08:53.115 --> 08:55.785
our own Taco Bell franchise.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.037
But then it happened,

08:58.120 --> 09:00.248
the one thing
you never want to hear.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.375
Hey, John.
I was just thinking.

never said anything about Pizza Hut.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.765
I was young and bullheaded.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.227
I had these ideas
of what fast food should be.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.729
Worst part was,
when I told her the bad news,

09:23.813 --> 09:25.898
she threw my retainer
right in the bushes.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.527
I looked for a little bit, but eventually
I just said, "Eh, screw it."

09:29.610 --> 09:32.530
Anyway, that one argument
consumed us.

at any of my texts?

-Honestly? Nothing.

Look, if I want someone
to burp the national anthem,

I'm not sure about that.

he's prayed on this one.

out of the ice machine?

-What?

like, 30 miles from here.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.418
Hmm. Is 30 miles enough time

11:09.502 --> 11:11.796
for me to get totally jacked
before I see her?

11:11.879 --> 11:14.799

and he disappeared.

I'll be right back.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.901
Excuse me, have you seen
a heavyset, middle-aged man?

11:33.984 --> 11:35.486
Kind of sad-looking?

Hmm.

Oh.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.913
Hey, you know, there was a guy that
left in a yellow cab a few minutes ago.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.457
He got the number from
a magazine in his pocket.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.502
I've never seen such
stretched-out pockets on a sport coat.
