TV ANNOUNCER: ESPN now returns
to our 30 for 30 documentary

00:37.287 --> 00:39.622
on the Houston Astros cheating scandal.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.666
We knew the Astros were stealing signals.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.085
Someone was back there
banging on a trash can.

00:44.169 --> 00:45.795
We just couldn't figure out who.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.256
NARRATOR: Several players
were interviewed by the league,

00:48.340 --> 00:50.800
but none would reveal the mastermind

00:50.884 --> 00:53.511
of this garbage can scheme.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.597
Hey, everyone. I have some news.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.517
I got a job writing for Quahog's
top website, The Hog.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.978
Starting tomorrow,
I'm an online journalist.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.606
Isn't The Hog that stupid pop culture site

01:04.689 --> 01:06.441
with those lame quizzes
telling you what character

01:06.524 --> 01:07.901
you are in a show?

01:07.984 --> 01:10.570
Peter's mad 'cause
he always gets Barney Rubble.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.697
If I were mad, would I laugh like this?

01:12.781 --> 01:14.199
(laughs)

01:14.282 --> 01:15.867
I don't think so.

01:15.950 --> 01:17.327
Congratulations, Brian.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.329
Yeah, we're all very happy for you.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.955
Thanks. I'm really excited.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.624
And I totally nailed the interview.

01:22.707 --> 01:24.501
So, Brian, I got a great recommendation

01:24.584 --> 01:26.002
from your last employer.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.713
Yes, I worked for Mr. Skin
at five dollars a pun.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.965
You know, I came up with Halle's Berries,

01:31.049 --> 01:33.385
Elle Fanny, Abigail Breastlin.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.929
You're really good
at sexualizing children.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.555
-I-Is that a problem?
-No, no, no.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.557
That's a big part of online journalism.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.518
Now, let's have a look
at your sample material.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.478
Well, I've got a listicle
of alcohol brands

01:43.561 --> 01:45.355
that are also guys' names.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.024
Whoa!
Talk about bursting out of the gates.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.694
Cardi B tweeted something
and I retweeted it

01:50.777 --> 01:52.987
with "This, this, this, this, this."

01:53.071 --> 01:55.532
Wow.
That is some top-shelf journalism.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.242
And here's some pictures of cute animals

01:57.325 --> 01:59.160
that wives can
shove in their husbands' faces

01:59.244 --> 02:00.829
to keep them from ever going to sleep.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.832
Brian, stop.
I can only hire you so many times.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.792
Welcome to The Hog.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.545
I'll ask my roommate to move
his car so you can pull out.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.844
Cup of joe and a greasy roll, please.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.221
Okay, whatever this is, I already hate it.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.598
Sorry, I'm up against a deadline
on a big story.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.269
Major ramifications.
Lid, prepare to be blown off.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.938
"Best butts to sniff at the park."

02:27.022 --> 02:29.065
I, um, I don't... I-I don't think

02:29.149 --> 02:30.984
this is an article for human readers.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.445
Now hold on there, Stewie,
just hear the man out.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.863
Thank you, Chris.

02:34.946 --> 02:36.948
I also posted
a couple of articles last night.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.366
Real think pieces.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.702
"Star Wars movies ranked best to worst

02:40.785 --> 02:42.787
except for the two I haven't seen."

02:42.871 --> 02:45.248
Well, that seems lazy.
And which two didn't you see?

02:45.331 --> 02:48.126
Uh, the original Star Wars
and The Empire Strikes Back.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.713
I'd still rather read
that than "9/11s since 2000

02:51.796 --> 02:53.590
"ranked best to worst.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.217
Number one may surprise you."

02:56.301 --> 02:58.470
September 11, 2014?

02:58.553 --> 03:01.097
We lost Richard Kiel,

TV ANNOUNCER:
Thank you for watching
Cox Cable On Demand.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.447
We have a lot of great movies,

03:17.530 --> 03:19.115
like Guy Ritchie's Snatch on Cox.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.533
All right...

03:20.617 --> 03:22.369
And we've got other great features.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.830
If you want to see
Carrie, Blow, Big, Shaft

03:25.914 --> 03:29.292

you need Cox.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.419
Okay, I... I guess they're all movies.

03:31.503 --> 03:33.254

you didn't know about Jerry Seinfeld.

-(clicks)
-All right, new article,

03:58.113 --> 04:00.365
"One Fact You Didn't Know
About Michael Richards."

04:00.448 --> 04:02.075
You can't use that word in an article.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.620
And I will find a new show to write about.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.876
Hey, I'm working on a story about fat guys

04:11.960 --> 04:13.545
belly-flopping onto cement.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.797
Will you put on these roller
skates and go clean the gutters?

04:15.880 --> 04:17.048
I'm not doing that.

04:17.132 --> 04:18.675
It might get retweeted by Joe Rogan.

04:18.758 --> 04:21.636
Ooh.
I'll do anything Joe Rogan says.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.681
I think he's the best dumb guy king
we've ever had.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.975
When this story breaks, it's gonna be big.

Pawtucket Pat.

well-adjusted person

Okay, this is everything they have on Pat.

God, I bet no one's even read
most of this stuff before.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.518
Huh, what's this?

05:10.602 --> 05:13.313
Some kind of leather-bound book
sealed with wax.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.109
Wow.
I think it's his diary.

05:18.193 --> 05:20.320
See?
Men can too have diaries.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.864
Yeah, his cover
doesn't have sparkles, champ.

05:22.947 --> 05:26.076
First page.
"Dad, don't read this."

05:26.159 --> 05:29.412
Second page.
"Seriously, Dad, don't read this."

05:29.496 --> 05:31.748

Fourth page.
"I kissed my sister."

05:35.710 --> 05:38.463
Okay, let's flip ahead.

05:38.546 --> 05:40.090
Oh, my God.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.050
-What?
-He says that he didn't create

05:42.133 --> 05:43.760
his recipe for beer.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.762
He stole it from some Native Americans

05:45.845 --> 05:47.555
and killed them to keep his secret,

05:47.639 --> 05:49.557
and then he kissed his sister again.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.559
What?
That's insane.

05:51.643 --> 05:54.396
Pawtucket Pat
is the most revered person in Quahog.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.773
Not anymore.
This is a big story.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.984
Can you believe it?
It's like we're Woodward and Berenstain.

06:00.068 --> 06:01.945
Follow the honey.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.493

Hey, hey.
What are you guys doing?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.254
Why are you so upset about Pat?

06:19.337 --> 06:21.464
Pawtucket Pat was a phony!

06:21.548 --> 06:22.966
(chuckles)
I remember you.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.676
But no, he isn't.
He's a hero.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.053
Not anymore.
He's a racist murderer

06:27.137 --> 06:30.056
and this statue should be torn down.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.936
(sighs)
God, there's a lot wrong with this,

06:35.020 --> 06:36.146
but you can't tear this down.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.439
Pat's an icon.

06:37.522 --> 06:39.232
That statue belongs
right here in the park,

06:39.315 --> 06:41.818
next to the statue
of Quahog's greatest missionary,

06:41.901 --> 06:43.361
Father Touchboys.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.321
That statue was removed a year ago.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.365
For what?!

06:54.122 --> 06:55.832
Good afternoon, I'm Tom Tucker.

06:55.915 --> 06:59.085
Our top story: the revelations
about local hero Pawtucket Pat

06:59.169 --> 07:01.004
continue to rock Quahog.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.797
The town is divided
over whether his statue

07:02.881 --> 07:04.632
should remain in the park.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.802
Even the pigeons who poop on it
are in a moral quandary.

07:07.886 --> 07:11.264
So, what do you two
think of the statue being on public land?

07:11.348 --> 07:14.267
-Coo.
-Not coo.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.894
PETER:
My friend is the mailman.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.229
I'm gonna give him a heart attack.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.191
Good job, Brian.
Your work has actually made an impact.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.984
Thanks, Stewie.
I think everybody's

07:23.068 --> 07:24.402
gonna be happy about this.

07:24.486 --> 07:26.154
Where do you get off?!

07:26.237 --> 07:29.240
In my bedroom, mostly.
Sometimes the bathroom.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.659
Or wherever I see a lady seal an envelope.

07:31.743 --> 07:35.205
Good, good.
I am glad we can talk frankly about sex.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.290
And Brian, how dare you try to take down

07:37.374 --> 07:38.958
the statue of Pawtucket Pat?

07:39.042 --> 07:40.293
Oh, my God.
You don't actually support

07:40.377 --> 07:41.753
keeping it there, do you?

07:41.836 --> 07:44.005
Of course I do.
It's been there my whole life.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.466
And I am gonna do whatever
it takes to keep it up.

07:46.549 --> 07:49.260
Finally, Peter cares
about keeping something up.

07:49.344 --> 07:52.430
Lois, will you stifle yourself?

07:52.514 --> 07:54.516
(laughter, applause)

07:55.642 --> 07:58.395
Yesterday, Meg sat there without pants.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.106
Yuck.
Brian, Pat is a hero.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.816
H-He practically built Quahog.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.359
And his statue is part of the town.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.236
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna let

08:06.319 --> 08:08.780
some draft-dodging liberals tear it down.

08:08.863 --> 08:10.448
-We don't have a draft.
-Well, then,

08:10.532 --> 08:12.659
who shaved my head
and yelled at me for two months?

08:12.742 --> 08:15.286
Peter, we've been over this.
That was the Heaven's Gate cult.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.038
Oh, right, that-that thing with the shoes.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.748
Yeah, o-once I got the shoes, I split.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.375
The statue has got to go.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.293
Brian, for years, it's been a tradition

08:22.377 --> 08:24.379
that every boy, when he turns 16,

08:24.462 --> 08:27.716
has to kiss the statue's crotch
while his friends take pictures.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.426
That's not a tradition.

08:29.509 --> 08:32.679
Ah, then I think
some fun was had at my expense.

08:32.762 --> 08:35.306
Peter, we can't leave a symbol
like that in the town square.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.183
Pawtucket Pat was a horrible racist.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.269
Well, so is Tucker Carlson,
but we still say hi to him

08:39.352 --> 08:40.687
at the company picnic.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.731
Brian, if you apply the values of today

08:42.814 --> 08:44.899
to people who lived almost 300 year ago,

08:44.983 --> 08:46.943
uh, doesn't that mean we'd have
to take down the statues

08:47.027 --> 08:48.611
of pretty much everyone?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.530
I-I mean, where do you draw the line?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.907
Wait a minute, y-you don't agree
with Peter, do you?

08:52.991 --> 08:55.118
I don't know.
I-I'm uncomfortable

08:55.201 --> 08:57.704
with a racist statue being smack
in the middle of Quahog,

08:57.787 --> 09:01.833
but as a woman, I need landmarks
to find my way around town.

09:01.916 --> 09:05.086
I mean, without that statue,
I'm completely disoriented.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.256
Okay, if anyone needs me,
I'll be in the kitchen.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.010
Damn it, who moved the lamp?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.596
Well, what does the rest
of the family think? Chris?

09:14.679 --> 09:17.557
-Ha! You got sunflowered.
-What?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.226
When a Gen Z kid
wants out of a conversation,

09:20.310 --> 09:22.645
he leaves a large sunflower in his place.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.022
That's ridiculous.
There is no way

09:24.105 --> 09:25.732
that children regularly disappear

09:25.815 --> 09:27.776
and then replace themselves
with sunflowers

09:27.859 --> 09:29.319
just to express their boredom.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.280
Ha. You got sunflowered again.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.490
Why are you back?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.742
(scoffs)
We only have one sunflower.

09:35.825 --> 09:38.536
Okay, I-I clearly don't understand
your generation,

09:38.620 --> 09:40.872
but Meg, you're currently
taking world history.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
What do you think
should happen to the statue?

09:42.791 --> 09:46.002
I don't care.
I'm an agent of chaos.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.046
Ow! Well, screw you guys.

09:48.129 --> 09:51.716
Pawtucket Pat is a hero.
That statue ain't going nowhere.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.719
It's a part of history.
Just like Catherine the Great.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.805
My great people of Russia.

09:56.888 --> 10:01.267
As your empress, my legacy shall
be expanding Russia's borders,

10:01.351 --> 10:03.645
growing her armies, building palaces

10:03.728 --> 10:06.064
that will be admired for centuries...

10:06.147 --> 10:08.858
We heard you had sex with a horse!

10:08.942 --> 10:13.113
I have created alliances
with the great powers of Europe...

10:13.196 --> 10:15.115
What about the horse sex?

10:15.198 --> 10:17.117
There is no horse sex!

10:17.200 --> 10:18.785
Is this guy bothering you, Cathy?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.453
I can handle this.

10:23.331 --> 10:27.002
Hey guys, I got you all
"Keep Up the Statue" hats, or "KUTS."

10:27.085 --> 10:30.630
Kuts? Isn't that the lady's
hairdresser down the street?

10:30.714 --> 10:32.716
Why don't you tell me?

10:35.176 --> 10:37.095
Peter, I'm not wearing a Kuts hat.

10:37.178 --> 10:38.555
Come on, if I refer three friends,

10:38.638 --> 10:39.889
I get a free blowout.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.683
Tell them Mary Sparkles sent you.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.768
But never call me that
in front of my family.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.397
Where was this place, again?

10:47.480 --> 10:50.358
Peter, anybody who supports
that statue is a racist.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.153
Racist?
How can a 300-pound white guy

10:53.236 --> 10:55.655
who looks at black porn be racist?

10:55.739 --> 10:57.490
Here, Peter.
You were sent a beer

10:57.574 --> 10:59.200
by that table of businessmen.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.036
-Which table?
-No, no. No, no. Don't look.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.329
Make them come to you.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.623
You guys haven't read my book, have you?

11:10.128 --> 11:12.172
-Peter, they're leaving.
-They'll come.

11:12.255 --> 11:14.090
They're getting in their vehicle.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.301
-They're pulling into the street
without looking.
-(tires screech, loud crash)

11:16.384 --> 11:18.136
Oh, no, they've been hit by a bus!

11:18.219 --> 11:20.096
They'll come.
I followed the rules.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.474
Peter, they can't come.
They're dead.

11:22.557 --> 11:25.226
That was the day I lost my sparkle.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.812
I was just Mary after that.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.610
Excuse me, would you sign
this petition demanding

11:33.693 --> 11:34.986
that the city take down the...

11:35.070 --> 11:36.488
Take down the what?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.615
-Uh, nothing.
-Good.

11:38.698 --> 11:41.034
Hey, could you do me a favor
and elbow-wipe

11:41.117 --> 11:43.828
74 years of pigeon (bleep)
off my shoulders?

11:43.912 --> 11:45.622
Uh, okay.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.375
Who are you, anyway?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.710
I'm Rhode Island founder Roger Williams,

11:50.794 --> 11:53.463
otherwise known as the end
of the worst field trip

11:53.546 --> 11:55.507
in elementary school history.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.551
It's true.
The kids are very disappointed.

11:58.635 --> 12:03.139
Oh, yeah, "And Wife"
is totally getting' them jazzed.

12:03.223 --> 12:07.018
-(horn honks)
-Move, Brian, you're in my spot.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.772
You're Mrs. Groceries?

12:10.855 --> 12:12.774
She touched the manager over the pants.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.235
Love her or hate her, she plays to win.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.903
-Anyway, how's it going?
-Not good.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.822
I'm not getting any signatures
on this petition.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.782
Really?
It looks like you've got quite a few.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.284
Oh, mostly they just say, "Brian is gay."

12:23.368 --> 12:25.662
Yeah, I have to be careful.
If 200 people write it,

12:25.745 --> 12:27.956
-it goes on the ballot.
-Well, at least you're trying.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.082
I mean, what is Peter doing

12:29.165 --> 12:30.583
to drum up support for his side?

12:30.667 --> 12:31.793
PETER (on bullhorn):
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:31.876 --> 12:35.463
to support Pawtucket Pat,
please welcome Kid Rock.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.551
Hello, Quahog.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.470
Whenever there's a town debate
with racial overtones,

12:42.554 --> 12:45.598
-I'm there on the wrong side.
-(all cheering)

12:45.682 --> 12:47.892
Aw, crap, everybody run.
It's Adult Rock.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.270
Kid, you want to tell me why
I found your mother's

12:50.353 --> 12:52.981
best T-shirt-cutting scissors
outside in the rain?

12:53.064 --> 12:55.066
-(scoffs) I don't know.
-(sighs)

12:55.150 --> 12:58.111
Why can't you be more
like your brother, The?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.576
Rupert, I was going over
our credit card statement.

13:04.659 --> 13:07.787
There's a charge for two tickets
to Tootsie the musical,

13:07.871 --> 13:11.541
yet I don't remember going
to see Tootsie the musical.

13:11.624 --> 13:15.587
Now, I'm hoping the good news
is I'm ruining the surprise.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.630
God, I can't believe
Peter is actually winning

13:17.714 --> 13:19.591
public support for that damn statue.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.301
And he's throwing rocks through my window,

13:21.384 --> 13:22.594
and it's his house.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.846
-(Peter grunting)
-(heavy thud)

13:24.929 --> 13:26.431
Ugh, that rock was too heavy.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.225
Got to find something lighter.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.227
Okay, so something in between.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.146
That statue is such a disgrace.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.814
I'll tell you, part of me
wants to march down

13:34.898 --> 13:36.691
to that park and remove it myself.

13:36.775 --> 13:39.027
Well, why don't you?
It'd be a noble act.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.820
Think of it as civil disobedience.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.906
Disobedience?
But I'm a good boy.

13:42.989 --> 13:45.617
I obey. I always obey.
I'm a good boy who obeys.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.285
Okay, d-don't think of it as disobedience,

13:47.369 --> 13:48.953
Forget I used that word.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.580
You're a weird guy, Bri.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.916
A weird doggy guy.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.377
PETER:
Ha! Found some medium rocks.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.337
You know what?
That's a great idea.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.340
Like not separating immigrant
children from their families.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.425
(applause)

14:04.427 --> 14:06.554
If you're the first one
to stop applauding,

14:06.638 --> 14:08.056
that means you're racist.

14:08.139 --> 14:10.141
(applause intensifies)

14:11.434 --> 14:13.436
(applause continues)

14:15.897 --> 14:17.148
(applause stops)

14:17.232 --> 14:18.733
Thanks for helping me, Stewie.

14:18.817 --> 14:20.068
All right, let's tie the rope
around the statue

14:20.151 --> 14:21.403
and tow it out of here.

14:21.486 --> 14:23.154
All right, great.
But before we begin,

14:23.238 --> 14:24.823
I'm just going to use the park bathroom

14:24.906 --> 14:26.449
-at night.
-Stewie, no.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.079
I got a lollipop!

14:34.833 --> 14:36.001
That's great, bud.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.802
Now let's stop talking about
that lollipop and get to work.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.934
Okay, we're almost ready to do this.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.185
Did you bring the masks?

14:54.269 --> 14:55.979
-Right here.
-What the hell is this?

14:56.062 --> 14:57.689
You said to bring masks.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.191
These are from last year's
charity ball at the Guggenheim.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.444
Whatever.
Just help me tie this rope to the car.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.696
Sorry, I need a free hand
to hold up my mask.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.614
Enough with the damn masks!

15:13.580 --> 15:15.623
All right, let's get this statue
out of here.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.974
I guess you only paid
for driver's side airbags.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.061
Yeah. When I bought this,
I was dating a girl I didn't like.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.861
Wow, look at this.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.113
The statue's disappearance
is being covered everywhere.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.865
I can't believe we really did it.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.950
-I just hope we don't get caught.
-So what?

15:51.034 --> 15:53.495
Mom would just ground us
and take away screen time,

15:53.578 --> 15:56.039
and then realize that without
screens, she has to entertain us

15:56.122 --> 15:57.582
and immediately give it back.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.918
Stewie, destroying a statue is a felony.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.544
If we're caught, we'll go to prison.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.380
Prison?!
I can't go to prison.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.965
Peter watched all six seasons of Oz

16:06.049 --> 16:07.634
with me in a Babybjörn.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.679
I'm too young to have someone
go poo on my face.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.224
Well, there's really no good age
for it to happen.

16:18.269 --> 16:20.188
All right, Stewie, just relax.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.273
And don't do that weird,
nervous laugh you do

16:22.357 --> 16:24.192
-when you're hiding something.
-Got it.

16:24.275 --> 16:27.404
-Morning, everybody.
-Where have you guys been?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.114
(cackles)

16:29.197 --> 16:30.448
No-Nowhere, of course!

16:30.532 --> 16:31.866
(quietly):
Will you calm down?

16:31.950 --> 16:33.368
So, uh, where's Peter?

16:33.451 --> 16:36.371
Uh, he went to some rally
'cause the statue's gone.

16:36.454 --> 16:40.291
He's angrier than Al Pacino's
forehead liver spots.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.627
Comb your hair down instead of up.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.754
Give us some shade.
We're dying up here.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.506
Yeah, what do you call that haircut?

16:46.589 --> 16:48.174
You're nearly 80 years old.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.051
You look like the kid from Jerry Maguire.

16:50.135 --> 16:52.721
What are you going for
with all of these spots?

16:52.804 --> 16:55.265
I want to look like mashed potatoes,

16:55.348 --> 16:57.475
with the skins on.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.561
(indistinct chatter)

17:11.740 --> 17:13.533
This is awesome.
What a turnout.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.326
And look, here comes Fox News.

17:15.410 --> 17:18.413
(horn playing "Dixie")

17:18.496 --> 17:20.915
It's amazing how recently that show aired.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.960
That statue was a travesty
and so is the brewery.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.171
They should close it
and make juice instead.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.630
What?
How dare you?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.424
Juice will not replace us.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.343
(chanting):
Juice will not replace us!

17:31.426 --> 17:33.428
Juice will not replace us!

17:33.511 --> 17:35.096
My God, Peter, what are you doing?

17:35.180 --> 17:37.849
Taking up politics
to avoid intimacy with my wife.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.726
Peter, is that you?

17:39.809 --> 17:42.020
(gasps)
I thought we could protest together.

17:42.103 --> 17:45.106
All right, no more politics.
Time for trains in the basement.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.650
-MAN: Stop!
-Collaborate and listen.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.736
We are from the Narragansett tribe,

17:49.819 --> 17:52.906
from whom Pawtucket Pat stole his recipe.

17:52.989 --> 17:57.035
And we are annoyed that no one
has asked us what we think.

17:57.118 --> 18:00.080
You guys kind of dress like
weekend Jay Leno.

18:00.163 --> 18:04.000
Thank you. We've just
come from the Wang-Holder wedding.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.418
(laughs)
See?

18:05.502 --> 18:07.212
Little more of that, John Oliver,

18:07.295 --> 18:09.381
and maybe you'll finally
get that 14th Emmy.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.049
Well, what do you guys think?

18:11.132 --> 18:13.677
This statue is only
the tip of the iceberg.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.596
The pressing issue isn't
what someone did 300 years ago,

18:16.680 --> 18:18.932
it's how do we help Native Americans today

18:19.015 --> 18:22.644
and end the institutional racism
that still plagues society?

18:22.727 --> 18:24.437
The poverty rate on reservations...

18:25.480 --> 18:28.191
Oh, damn, you got sunflowered.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.651
Everyone, come back.

18:29.734 --> 18:31.736
Uh, come back.
he makes a good point.

18:31.820 --> 18:35.073
We've all been so focused
on what the statue means to us

18:35.156 --> 18:36.491
we didn't even stop to consider

18:36.574 --> 18:38.743
how Pawtucket Pat affected others.

18:38.827 --> 18:40.370
But Pat's the town hero.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.289
If he's nothing, then so is Quahog.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.709
-(indistinct chatter)
-No, it's not.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.670
Quahog is still a wonderful town.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.297
I-I mean, we still got
one of those Arby's signs.

18:51.381 --> 18:54.092
You know? T-The old ones,
you know, with the big old hat?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.052
That's been gone for ten years.

18:56.136 --> 18:58.513
Oh, (bleep) this place.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.181
No, no, you know what?
No.

19:00.265 --> 19:02.183
Quahog is a wonderful town,

19:02.267 --> 19:05.520
because of who we are and what we do,

19:05.603 --> 19:09.399
not because of some guy
who stole beer 300 years ago.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.609
Especially when he did horrible things

19:11.693 --> 19:13.611
to some of our fellow citizens.

19:13.695 --> 19:16.114
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:16.197 --> 19:17.532
Thank you, Peter.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.451
Now, crowd of angry whites,

19:19.534 --> 19:22.912
I think we all owe
our Native American friends an apology.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.539
ALL:
Sorry.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.249
Angry whites.

19:26.332 --> 19:28.668
-ALL: Sorry!
-That's better.

19:28.752 --> 19:31.671
Well, Brian,
I guess I owe you an apology, too.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.381
You were right from the start.

19:33.465 --> 19:35.300
Sorry things got so heated between us

19:35.383 --> 19:37.302
and that I took a dump in your dog food.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.013
-Wait, what?
-I know. Politics, huh?

19:40.096 --> 19:43.475
-Come on everybody, let's go home.
-I'll drive.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.229
Where the hell are we?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.530
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

19:57.614 --> 20:00.075
Our top story: the statue of Pawtucket Pat

20:00.158 --> 20:02.494
was found earlier today
in the Quahog River.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.829
In the spirit of compromise,
the town has decided

20:04.913 --> 20:07.374
that it will be relocated
to the Quahog Museum,

20:07.457 --> 20:09.000
where it will be both remembered

20:09.084 --> 20:11.211
and never seen by anyone ever again.

20:11.294 --> 20:14.130
Well, thank God
this whole controversy is behind us.

20:14.214 --> 20:16.800
Yeah. And Peter,
I'm glad you came to your senses.

20:16.883 --> 20:19.719
Me, too. You know,
we might even win an award for this.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.930
-Really?
-Yeah, award voters love it

20:22.013 --> 20:23.473
when someone
with a right-leaning viewpoint

20:23.556 --> 20:25.016
admits they're wrong.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.434
They declare it's good storytelling

20:26.518 --> 20:27.852
and character development.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.938
Ooh, like Three Billboards.

20:30.021 --> 20:32.065
-And Green Book.
-Driving Miss Daisy.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.692
American History X.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.777
Yeah, all those.
And many more.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.613
But can anyone name a single movie
where someone on the left

20:38.697 --> 20:42.492
took on a more
Republican-leaning viewpoint?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.327
Doesn't even have to have won an award.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.246
Just has to exist.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.958
Anyone?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.419
Anything?

20:52.502 --> 20:55.505
What about Fritz Lang's Metropolis?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.923
How'd you get here?

20:57.007 --> 21:00.010
Mm, in my Hyundai Sonata.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.720
(shudders)

21:33.793 --> 21:35.754
