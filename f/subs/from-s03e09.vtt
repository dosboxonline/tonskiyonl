[Boyd]
Previously on From...

00:18.728 --> 00:20.229
That's why you wanted
a divorce--

00:20.312 --> 00:23.399
'cause it would be easier
for you to cut and run,

00:23.482 --> 00:26.485
instead of trying to put
our family back together!

00:26.569 --> 00:28.529
When you're with your wife,

00:28.612 --> 00:31.240
you should shut
the fuck up and listen.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.658
What you're doing,

00:32.741 --> 00:35.161
how tight you're
holding on to everything,

00:35.244 --> 00:38.038
you're doing it
because you're scared.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.916
Ever since I woke up, something
has been happening to me.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.543
I hear people screaming.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.463
You're at a threshold.
The hero has to be brave.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.342
[voices screaming]

00:50.426 --> 00:52.011
Julie! Julie!

00:52.094 --> 00:53.888
It was the boy in white.

00:53.971 --> 00:56.766
He was the one that was
telling secrets to Christopher.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.350
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

00:58.434 --> 01:00.186
What?

01:00.269 --> 01:02.855
I told my mother
what the Boy in White said.

01:02.938 --> 01:04.690
Help me, Elgin.

01:04.774 --> 01:07.234
I can save all of you.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.536
Is this really
where it happens?

01:17.620 --> 01:19.747
[Fatima]
We were in the greenhouse.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.248
She was trying to help me.

01:21.332 --> 01:22.875
Oh, Fatima!

01:22.958 --> 01:25.753
- I said go!
- [gasps]

01:25.836 --> 01:28.756
I couldn't stop.
[breathing unsteadily]

01:28.839 --> 01:32.301
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her

01:32.384 --> 01:34.595
or else this place has
finally broken her mind.

01:34.678 --> 01:39.475
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

01:39.558 --> 01:42.019
I'm gonna leave supplies for you
at the shack twice a week.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.481
Fatima!

01:45.564 --> 01:48.150
[Elgin] It's the only place
that the baby will be safe.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.443
There is no baby!

01:49.527 --> 01:50.610
Yes, there is.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.238
It's just not yours.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.781
Out of my way!

01:55.074 --> 01:57.827
No! No, no! No! No, no!

01:57.910 --> 02:00.621
Elgin! Help!

02:03.249 --> 02:06.961
[Ellis] Fatima! Fatima!

02:08.838 --> 02:10.172
Hey, it's getting dark.

02:10.256 --> 02:12.508
I'm not going back
to town without her, Dad.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.593
Listen, Ellis,
she took the talisman.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.428
So what? All right,
she wouldn't just leave.

02:16.512 --> 02:18.264
We don't know that.
Maybe she--

02:18.347 --> 02:20.182
Hey, listen to me.
Listen to me.

02:20.266 --> 02:23.310
Look, we can come back out
in the morning, okay?

02:23.394 --> 02:24.978
No, I'm not leaving her
out here overnight.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.773
What are you gonna do, huh?
You just gonna-- You just--

02:27.857 --> 02:29.942
[gasps]

02:30.025 --> 02:31.443
What's wrong with your hand?

02:31.527 --> 02:35.447
Nothing. Let's just, uh...
Let's just, uh--

02:35.531 --> 02:37.199
let's just--
[grunts]

02:37.283 --> 02:38.617
-Hey!
-[groans]

02:38.701 --> 02:40.119
Dad?

02:40.202 --> 02:41.203
-[groans]
-What's wrong?

02:41.287 --> 02:42.663
Okay.

02:42.746 --> 02:44.456
What's wrong?

02:44.540 --> 02:46.166
[breathing heavily]

02:46.250 --> 02:47.751
Okay, come here.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.546
I got you.

02:50.629 --> 02:51.964
[grunting]

02:52.047 --> 02:54.884
Yeah. Watch it.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.352
[door opens]

03:08.272 --> 03:09.356
Hey.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.193
I got you some things

03:13.277 --> 03:15.863
to help you get
a little more comfortable.

03:15.946 --> 03:18.365
Elgin...

03:18.449 --> 03:22.661
please, just let me go.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.414
You're not a prisoner here.
I told you,

03:25.497 --> 03:27.708
this is for your own good.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.251
Hey.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.339
I'm trying to protect you.

03:33.422 --> 03:37.176
Elgin, listen to me.
I saw her.

03:37.259 --> 03:41.513
That thing that's
been speaking to you, I saw her.

03:41.597 --> 03:43.557
What she's saying isn't true.

03:43.641 --> 03:46.602
This thing inside me,
it's not good.

03:46.685 --> 03:50.105
It won't do good things.
Look at what happened to Tillie.

03:50.189 --> 03:53.275
That happened because
the baby was scared.

03:53.359 --> 03:56.028
-Elgin...
-It was hungry.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.197
You know,
you weren't feeding it.

03:58.280 --> 04:00.741
Fatima,
you have to stop fighting.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.786
Hey, hey, hey.
You know, wait, wait, wait.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.579
Fatima, Fatima, Fatima, please.

04:05.663 --> 04:09.792
Just listen. Listen.
It's okay. It's okay.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.629
-[gasps in pain]
-Just sit.

04:13.712 --> 04:17.007
[breathing unsteadily]

04:19.218 --> 04:21.470
You need to eat.

04:21.553 --> 04:25.391
The sooner you eat,
the stronger the baby will be,

04:25.474 --> 04:27.685
and before you know it,
we'll be going home.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.689
All of us.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.401
The baby already
helped us once.

04:35.484 --> 04:38.570
The night I found out
you were pregnant,

04:38.654 --> 04:43.951
I remembered my dream, and that
helped Boyd save the town.

04:45.244 --> 04:47.162
Elgin, no.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.248
It's so hungry, Fatima.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.416
-Just a little.
-No.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.960
Please?

04:53.043 --> 04:56.130
You helped me so much
since I first got here.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.089
Please let me help you.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.132
No.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.970
Come on.
Just a little bit.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.844

look right here.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.638
Gonna check your pupils.

08:32.721 --> 08:35.015
Good.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.725
Is she okay?

08:36.808 --> 08:40.145
Well, I don't see any signs
of trauma, so that's good.

I'm fine.

can you walk me through again

There's not much to say.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.538
Uh, we got to the ruins,

08:58.622 --> 09:01.583
I walked inside,
and then I blacked out.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.836
You don't
remember anything else?

09:04.920 --> 09:08.215
I... I had

[exhales heavily]

I'd like to keep you overnight,

What were you and Ethan
doing out there?

09:40.330 --> 09:42.708
It was stupid. We...

09:42.790 --> 09:45.210
I went to the woods
yesterday with Randall

09:45.294 --> 09:46.712
and then,
we got to the ruins--

Are you okay?

-I'll be right back.

Are you hurt?

What were you and Julie
doing out in the woods?

10:55.530 --> 10:58.450
What did she say we were
doing in the woods?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.202
I'm asking you.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.621
[door closes]

11:02.704 --> 11:04.956
Look, if this is your version
of the big bad dad routine,

11:05.040 --> 11:06.541
I'm not in the fucking mood,
all right?

11:06.625 --> 11:10.128
After what happened with you
and Marielle and Julie...

11:10.212 --> 11:12.297
She won't talk about it.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.342
And I know she's
going through something that...

11:15.425 --> 11:19.012
I cannot understand,
but I figured you might.

11:19.096 --> 11:22.599
I was teaching her
how to drive, man.

11:23.975 --> 11:26.686
-What?
-She said she didn't have

11:26.770 --> 11:28.855
her learner's permit, so we
boosted the Colony House van.

11:28.939 --> 11:30.690
I...

11:30.774 --> 11:34.027
freaked out about something
and we ended up in the woods.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.322
And the ruins
that you saw?

11:37.406 --> 11:40.700
Look, man,
I don't mean to be a dick,

11:40.784 --> 11:43.370
but I got my own shit
going on, all right?

11:43.453 --> 11:46.498
You want me to explain what
happened to us? Well, I can't.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.708
And I don't know
about those fucking ruins,

11:48.792 --> 11:50.836
but I told her
not to go back out there.

11:50.919 --> 11:52.045
Why?

11:55.257 --> 11:58.176
Because they...

11:58.260 --> 12:00.178
They just felt wrong.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.180
How?

12:02.264 --> 12:04.182
They just fucking did, Jim.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.393
That's what I got.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.228
Are we done?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.986
You want my advice?

12:20.615 --> 12:23.869
Go get the van and teach
your kid how to drive,

12:23.952 --> 12:25.996
because there is fuck all
you can do about the rest.

12:28.039 --> 12:31.042
None of us are
getting out of here alive.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.462
I don't accept that.

I had her in that shed
just outside of town.

26:15.700 --> 26:19.370
Ellis and I went there last
night and she was gone.

26:19.453 --> 26:22.206

that Sara hears?

26:25.793 --> 26:28.045
They said something took her.

26:28.129 --> 26:31.215
That she's close by,

26:31.299 --> 26:33.384

save her before it's too late.

were laughing.

what happened to me.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.129
Why would he?

27:10.212 --> 27:12.131
Because I asked him
what I should do,

27:12.214 --> 27:14.008
if I should go
inside the ruins or not.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.969

27:19.722 --> 27:21.932

always used to tell us,

27:22.016 --> 27:26.437
and I was afraid, and
I didn't know who else to ask.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.605
And no offense, but this whole

I know what you're
trying to do, but it's...

it's not making
anything better.

is a search party.

so we can bring her home.

29:09.165 --> 29:12.626

is that what killed Tillie?

29:12.710 --> 29:14.420
We don't know.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.882
Look, I don't have all the
information on what happened.

29:17.965 --> 29:20.468

that she's close by.

29:20.551 --> 29:21.635
How do you know that?

29:26.682 --> 29:28.434
I know that because
something here told us,

29:28.517 --> 29:31.437
something that--

29:31.520 --> 29:34.815
that wants us to know that
she's alone, that she's afraid.

29:34.899 --> 29:37.902
Something that thinks that we
don't have what it takes

29:37.985 --> 29:39.403
to find her.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.822
Now, look, I can't
tell anybody what to do.

29:41.906 --> 29:45.910

29:45.993 --> 29:48.746
We didn't always have these.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.916
When I first got here,
those things in the woods,

29:51.999 --> 29:53.417
they would come out at night

29:53.501 --> 29:56.128
and they would take
whoever the fuck they wanted.

couldn't break us.

to break us again.
