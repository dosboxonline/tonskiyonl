WEBVTT

01:03.933 --> 01:05.717
Man, voice-over: Do you know
that feeling when you're doing

01:05.717 --> 01:07.676
exactly what you were put
on the Earth to do?

01:09.373 --> 01:11.114
The one where it's like
everything inside you

01:11.114 --> 01:13.725
is moving together in harmony
with the universe?

01:16.989 --> 01:20.602
Different man: Get off!
Get off! Get off!

01:20.602 --> 01:24.649
Get off! Get off! Get off!

01:24.649 --> 01:26.260
Get in formation!

01:26.260 --> 01:27.957
Man, voice-over: No matter
what happens...

01:27.957 --> 01:29.524
What the fuck took
you so long, private?

01:29.524 --> 01:31.047
Man, voice-over:
everything will be OK.

01:31.047 --> 01:32.701
Do not fuck it up
on me, private!

01:32.701 --> 01:34.181
Sweet fucking
baby Jesus!

01:34.181 --> 01:35.399
Man, voice-over: Yeah.

01:35.399 --> 01:37.793
Me neither...

01:37.793 --> 01:40.622
but, you know,
one can hope, right?

01:40.622 --> 01:42.754
It started when I was a kid.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.234
I always needed to help people.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.584
Hey! Leave him alone!

01:46.584 --> 01:48.195
Or at least I wanted to...

01:48.195 --> 01:50.153
Unh!

01:50.153 --> 01:52.112
so I did what any normal,
red-blooded American would do.

01:55.158 --> 01:58.727
To our top summer associate.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.772
Man, voice-over:
I became a lawyer.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.731
That seemed like a safe move.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.689
You're welcome here
at this firm

02:04.689 --> 02:06.343
anytime you want.

02:06.343 --> 02:08.650
- You're one of us now,
all right?
Yeah!

02:08.650 --> 02:10.695
Man, voice-over: But then,
I saw it...

02:12.306 --> 02:15.483
a life of backyard grilling
and playdates,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.006
home improvement projects

02:17.006 --> 02:19.356
and overplanned
tourist adventures,

02:19.356 --> 02:21.532
neighbors I probably
didn't want to know,

02:21.532 --> 02:24.709
a wife I probably
didn't want to know either,

02:24.709 --> 02:26.798
maybe an affair
with my neighbor.

02:26.798 --> 02:29.192
The thing was whenever I saw
people like that,

02:29.192 --> 02:32.674
I always thought, "When did you
decide to stop trying?"

02:32.674 --> 02:34.545
So I folded that hand.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.858
Yeah. A year of law school left,
6 figures waiting,

02:42.858 --> 02:45.295
and I enlist
in the fucking army?

02:47.950 --> 02:49.778
I mean, what the actual fuck?

02:52.389 --> 02:53.912
Everyone thought I was insane.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.697
1, 2, 3!

02:55.697 --> 02:58.569
I thought I was insane.

02:58.569 --> 03:01.050
The next thing I knew,

03:01.050 --> 03:04.532
I made it through the Q Course
with Special Forces selection.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.233
One minute!

03:10.233 --> 03:11.321
Man, voice-over:
And for the first time

03:11.321 --> 03:12.801
in my entire life...

03:12.801 --> 03:14.150
Let's go surprise
some assholes!

03:14.150 --> 03:15.978
I was happy.

03:15.978 --> 03:18.328
Whoo! Let's do this!

03:18.328 --> 03:19.721
Saddle up!

03:22.811 --> 03:24.595
Whoo!

03:28.817 --> 03:32.037
I'd found something worth doing

03:32.037 --> 03:33.561
in a world where things
worth doing

03:33.561 --> 03:35.563
they didn't come around
very often.

03:35.563 --> 03:37.304
I found myself...

03:38.522 --> 03:40.437
Aah!

03:40.437 --> 03:41.873
I found love...

03:47.227 --> 03:48.358
Push! Push!

03:48.358 --> 03:49.664
I found family...

03:52.623 --> 03:54.973
Come on! Let's go!

03:54.973 --> 03:56.714
Man, voice-over:
and most of all,

03:56.714 --> 03:58.412
I found purpose.

04:00.979 --> 04:04.635
That's our target.
President Venegas.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.550
We're here to take
him out.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.294
See you on the ground!

04:20.651 --> 04:22.000
Huh?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.481
No! Shit! Ohh!

04:24.481 --> 04:28.224
Whoa! Ohh! Huh!

04:28.224 --> 04:30.052
Ohh!

04:30.052 --> 04:31.575
Unh!

04:31.575 --> 04:34.578
Oh, fuck! Aw, shit!

04:34.578 --> 04:36.667
Huh!

04:36.667 --> 04:40.062
No! Ohh! Unh!

04:40.062 --> 04:41.411
Huh!

04:46.547 --> 04:49.985
Guys. Ugh.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.900
Man, voice-over:
And just like that,

04:51.900 --> 04:53.554
my purpose was gone.

04:56.905 --> 05:00.604
I went back to the normal life
that I tried to avoid

05:00.604 --> 05:02.606
and couldn't feel more
like a failure.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.671
Mason!

05:23.671 --> 05:25.629
Mason!

05:25.629 --> 05:27.979
Casey's gonna be late
for school!

05:36.901 --> 05:39.382
Good morning.

05:39.382 --> 05:40.731
- Hey!
- Hey!

05:40.731 --> 05:42.211
Mm-wha!

05:42.211 --> 05:45.345
Ew! Your breath
smells, Daddy.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.391
Ohh. Got to brush
my teeth.

05:52.221 --> 05:54.571
OK. You want to drive?
No!

05:54.571 --> 05:56.921
OK. Yeah. In a few years,
it's all yours, though.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.401
All right? You in?
Everything...

05:58.401 --> 05:59.924
Mason, don't forget
her seatbelt.

05:59.924 --> 06:03.188
Make sure to buckle
your seatbelt.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.408
Please.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.323
Wave to Mommy
because she'll hate me

06:07.323 --> 06:09.194
even more than she
already does
if you don't.

06:14.069 --> 06:15.810
You know,
how's school going?

06:15.810 --> 06:17.377
There's a boy
named Chase

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
that bothers me
all the time.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.598
He tries to kiss me
and stuff.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.731
Boy tries to kiss you?
You're 9.

06:23.731 --> 06:25.733
- I'm 8, Daddy.
- That makes it even worse.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.604
Tell you what. The next time
he tries to kiss you,

06:27.604 --> 06:28.997
you hit him
in the throat.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.172
You know what
the throat is?

06:30.172 --> 06:31.652
I'm not an idiot.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.305
Just hit him
in the Adam's apple.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.568
All boys have them.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.221
Like penises?

06:36.221 --> 06:38.441
Uh, yes. Kind--yes.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.617
Um, just--just hit
him right here, OK?

06:40.617 --> 06:42.402
It'll make it so
he can't breathe
for a little bit.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.882
Like hitting him
in the penis.

06:44.882 --> 06:47.798
Yes, and you know what?
You can do that, also.

06:47.798 --> 06:49.931
All right? OK.
We're here.

06:49.931 --> 06:51.976
Remember your backpack.

06:51.976 --> 06:55.197
Go forth, wreak havoc,
and don't forget
your bookbag.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.546
Bye, Daddy.

06:56.546 --> 06:58.592
You have
a great day, OK?

06:58.592 --> 07:00.115
Learn things.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.169
So I told them...

07:12.823 --> 07:14.303
they can't charge me
those calls.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.044
I--I--I didn't
make those calls.

07:16.044 --> 07:18.612
I--I--I don't even know
any of those numbers.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.440
They won't leave me
alone, man.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.447
So, um--so you want
to hire me

07:27.447 --> 07:31.015
to... argue with your
phone company for you?

07:31.015 --> 07:33.278
Just my old
phone company.

07:34.889 --> 07:36.847
Scott, uh...

07:39.807 --> 07:42.505
you--you have my word
I will make this
all go away.

07:42.505 --> 07:46.074
Oh! Thank you.
Thank--thank you.

07:46.074 --> 07:48.990
Thank you.
Can I give you
a retainer?

07:48.990 --> 07:52.254
I'd feel better
with a retainer,
maybe just 500.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.603
Like your style, Scott.

07:53.603 --> 07:55.213
Ha! Oh, my gosh.

07:55.213 --> 07:57.346
Thank you.

07:57.346 --> 07:58.913
- This--
- There you go.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.784
This looks great.
I'll--

08:00.784 --> 08:02.656
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'll be in touch, OK?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.222
OK. Thank you.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.182
OK.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.431
You don't write,
you don't call.

08:40.737 --> 08:42.696
As I live and breathe.

08:42.696 --> 08:44.654
- Sebastian Earle.
- Hey!

08:44.654 --> 08:47.744
Aw, man.
Look at you.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.399
God. What are
you doing here?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.792
How'd they get you
in a suit?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.445
I could ask you
the same thing.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.491
Are you kidding?
I'm about to take on

08:55.491 --> 08:57.014
a global communications conglomerate,

08:57.014 --> 08:59.800
so I got to look
the part.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.150
I seem to recall
you saying that
quitting law

09:02.150 --> 09:03.978
was the best decision
you ever made.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.588
- I did.
- And that becoming a lawyer

09:05.588 --> 09:08.156
would only
crush your soul.

09:08.156 --> 09:10.593
Yeah, it has,
but I got a wife and a kid,

09:10.593 --> 09:12.813
and they both require
income, so...

09:12.813 --> 09:16.033
in lieu of that,
I generate broken dreams
for all involved.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.470
Well, do you have
a half-hour to spare
for an old friend?

09:18.470 --> 09:20.951
I want to show you something.

09:20.951 --> 09:22.562
I think Lady Justice
can wait.

09:53.375 --> 09:56.160
So what
do you think?

09:56.160 --> 09:57.466
I think you need
a lawyer.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.077
- You know a good one?
- Nope.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.644
Carry on, fellas.

10:01.644 --> 10:04.038
Yes, sir. Hey.

10:10.000 --> 10:14.396
CDI. Heh heh.
Chicks Dig It.

10:14.396 --> 10:17.660
Actually, Contracted
Defense Initiatives,

10:17.660 --> 10:20.402
but--but, yes, they do.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.447
You name it,
we got it,

10:22.447 --> 10:24.798
and if we don't,
we'll find it,
buy it, or build it.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.626
We can operate
in any environment

10:26.626 --> 10:28.279
and any operational condition.

10:29.585 --> 10:31.152
We are a one-stop shop
and shoot.

10:31.152 --> 10:34.677
Ranges, mock villages,
our own airstrip,

10:34.677 --> 10:36.418
the whole kit.

10:36.418 --> 10:39.029
- I opened up 7 years ago.
- Yeah, I remember,

10:39.029 --> 10:41.423
but honestly,
I never thought
you'd pull it off.

10:41.423 --> 10:43.773
Hey. Good on you, brother.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.470
Well, I started
with the U.S. government,

10:45.470 --> 10:47.472
then moved to Europe,
then Asia,

10:47.472 --> 10:49.300
then South America.

10:49.300 --> 10:51.825
Now we're over 80%
corporate contracts.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.175
We're grossing
high 8 figures
this year.

10:54.175 --> 10:58.483
Heh. Ahh. Private security
work's always been
a bit dicey for me.

10:58.483 --> 11:00.703
It's, like, a thin line
between mercenary work, yeah?

11:00.703 --> 11:03.401
Naw. Come on.
It's like any business.

11:03.401 --> 11:04.925
We sell a product.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.449
That product is security.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.756
Cavemen out there,
they're your product?

11:09.756 --> 11:11.714
They look the part,
and they keep the peace.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.542
Can't hire fast enough.

11:13.542 --> 11:16.545
Tons of ex-military,
a few cops--heh--

11:16.545 --> 11:18.199
and some good, old
boys with a passion

11:18.199 --> 11:19.809
for the Second Amendment.

11:19.809 --> 11:21.158
And steroids.

11:21.158 --> 11:22.769
- Don't ask, don't tell.
- Yeah.

11:22.769 --> 11:25.423
These guys are, uh, potentially

11:25.423 --> 11:28.775
your new colleagues.

11:28.775 --> 11:30.951
No. No.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.822
No!

11:32.822 --> 11:35.259
No, no, and no.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.783
Come on.

11:36.783 --> 11:38.741
I'm too broken down,
I'm--I'm out of shape.

11:38.741 --> 11:40.525
I'm too old to go running
around the world, Seb.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.223
I got a life here.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.356
Mason, I know you.
You're--you're miserable.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.793
That's not the point.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.533
Look. The truth is
broken or not

11:48.533 --> 11:50.666
you still look
the part.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.537
I'm asking
as a personal favor.

11:52.537 --> 11:55.149
I've got an easy
personal protection detail.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.673
It's a one-off.
Just help me out, huh?

11:57.673 --> 11:59.370
Total milk run.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.808
You guys don't look
like milkmen.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.041
!¡Viva Paldoñia!

12:18.041 --> 12:20.783
!¡Viva Paldoñia!

12:22.742 --> 12:24.526
Everybody is welcome
to Paldoñia.

12:24.526 --> 12:27.442
It's a beautiful country, beautiful.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.531
Juan Arturo Venegas.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.577
You kidding me?

12:36.886 --> 12:40.716
You took a job for the guy
that killed half our team?

12:40.716 --> 12:44.328
We were there to kill
him in the first place.

12:44.328 --> 12:46.809
Dude, chill. The job
isn't for Venegas.

12:46.809 --> 12:49.812
It's body work
for a journalist who's
gonna interview him.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.640
Just show up, be some
window dressing for her,

12:51.640 --> 12:53.468
make sure she doesn't
get groped.

12:53.468 --> 12:55.339
A bunch of our friends died
because of that guy.

12:59.213 --> 13:00.780
You don't have to
tell me.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.912
I know, and look.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.958
If he were to get
hit by a bus,

13:04.958 --> 13:07.090
I don't think anybody
would be too upset
about it.

13:07.090 --> 13:08.831
Believe me, I'd love
to do it myself,

13:08.831 --> 13:10.877
but I'm running
a business,

13:10.877 --> 13:12.879
and right now,
that business is
getting a journalist

13:12.879 --> 13:14.489
in and out of Paldoñia.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.534
Yeah. Send one
of your other guys.

13:16.534 --> 13:19.450
Heh. I can't spare
them for this.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.235
Listen. I'm trying
to break into

13:21.235 --> 13:23.150
the personal protection
racket for journalists,

13:23.150 --> 13:24.978
and this is
the first step,
so I'm overpaying.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.850
This is me trying to
hook you up, OK?

13:27.850 --> 13:30.244
No drama. Venegas
is sending a plane

13:30.244 --> 13:33.290
to D.C. tomorrow
to pick you guys up.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.814
I'm not interested.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.861
20 grand says you are.

13:40.341 --> 13:41.995
Who's the journalist?

13:41.995 --> 13:43.823
This year's recipient

13:43.823 --> 13:45.563
of the International Journalism
and Editors Award

13:45.563 --> 13:47.261
Claire Wellington.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.614
Thank you.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.621
Journalism
at its best,

13:59.621 --> 14:01.188
it's about the truth.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.537
I share this with all
the journalists

14:02.537 --> 14:04.234
who report the facts

14:04.234 --> 14:07.281
and who value the truth
above all.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.505
In my haste to break
a major story,

14:14.505 --> 14:18.466
I neglected... to perform
my due diligence

14:18.466 --> 14:20.903
in properly fact checking

14:20.903 --> 14:22.818
and thoroughly vetting
my sources.

14:22.818 --> 14:25.212
I have resigned
my position here.

14:28.650 --> 14:31.609
Make sure that she knows
what she did was wrong.

14:41.097 --> 14:45.014
So, uh, how's
everybody doing?

14:49.453 --> 14:51.542
You told your daughter
to hit a boy

14:51.542 --> 14:52.892
in the throat,
and that boy's father

14:52.892 --> 14:54.154
- is a lawyer.
- Um...

14:54.154 --> 14:56.069
A real lawyer.

14:59.376 --> 15:02.031
Uh, whatever this is,
it's gone, it's done.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.511
I can't do it
anymore, Mason.

15:03.511 --> 15:05.426
- I can't--
- Jenny, don't overreact.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.341
I'm not overreacting.
I think it might be best

15:07.341 --> 15:09.212
for everybody if you
did move out.

15:14.217 --> 15:16.263
Never mind. I'll get Casey,
and I'll go to my mom's.

15:16.263 --> 15:18.830
No. I'll go.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.622
Hey, Daddy.

15:33.497 --> 15:34.846
What are you doing?

15:34.846 --> 15:37.414
Building
a cruise ship.

15:37.414 --> 15:41.897
Cruise ship. Wow.
That's a good gig
if you can get it.

15:41.897 --> 15:46.423
Ahh. Listen. I got to go
out of town for a few days.

15:46.423 --> 15:49.296
It's for work.

15:49.296 --> 15:52.299
Do they have snow globes
where you're going?

15:52.299 --> 15:54.083
Tell you what.
If they do, I'll get you one.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.867
Thanks, Daddy.

16:03.527 --> 16:06.400
What do you mean
you're going out of town
for a few days?

16:06.400 --> 16:07.531
- I took a job.
- What?

16:07.531 --> 16:09.011
Yeah. Sebastian Earle
hooked me up.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.926
- What about your practice?
- Ha!

16:10.926 --> 16:13.320
You just said a minute ago
that I wasn't a real lawyer.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.583
What job is this?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.977
It's private security.
Easy stuff.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.369
Mason, no.

16:19.369 --> 16:21.110
That part
of your life is over.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.156
You're not gonna go
and get yourself killed

16:23.156 --> 16:24.896
and leave our daughter
without a father
to raise her.

16:24.896 --> 16:27.029
Just let me make
this money, OK?

16:27.029 --> 16:28.552
You think I don't know
how unhappy you are

16:28.552 --> 16:31.468
being just a husband
and a father?

16:31.468 --> 16:33.514
Imagine what it feels
like to be me,

16:33.514 --> 16:36.299
knowing that I'm
the life you
settled for.

16:36.299 --> 16:37.822
Jenny, I--

16:37.822 --> 16:41.130
On second thought,
actually, you should go.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.958
Maybe that's what
you need

16:42.958 --> 16:44.612
to fix yourself.

17:09.898 --> 17:11.682
Politics
in the workplace

17:11.682 --> 17:14.163
and--and the fallout
from that, please.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.515
No. It's great.
Of course you're being
a weasel about this.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.996
I can't say I'm surprised.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.607
Yeah. I wouldn't want to
tarnish your perfect reputation.

17:23.607 --> 17:25.261
You're a saint.
We both know it.

17:25.261 --> 17:26.610
Excuse me.
Claire Wellington?

17:29.787 --> 17:31.485
Well, please do,
and I'll be sure

17:31.485 --> 17:34.140
to badmouth you to anyone
who will listen.

17:34.140 --> 17:38.361
Hey. That's great.
Yeah. Same to you, asshole.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.407
Miss Wellington...

17:40.407 --> 17:42.844
I'm--I'm, uh--I'm
from CDI.

17:42.844 --> 17:46.326
I'm Mason Pettits.

17:46.326 --> 17:50.069
You're late.
Where's the car?

17:50.069 --> 17:51.635
It's, uh, this way.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.420
Great. Can you help me
with this?

17:58.468 --> 18:00.470
So you're
my Green Beret.

18:00.470 --> 18:02.777
Army Special Forces.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.301
Right. A Green Beret
is a hat.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.565
Delta Force isn't
the name of anything
but a bad movie.

18:08.565 --> 18:11.177
I've met my share
of your colleagues.

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
So where'd you serve?

18:13.135 --> 18:16.007
Oh. All
the loveliest places.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.487
I was in
the Middle East,

18:17.487 --> 18:19.141
South America
of course.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.665
Ooh! North Carolina.

18:21.665 --> 18:25.147
And that tan line
on your ring finger?

18:25.147 --> 18:27.541
We don't wear
wedding rings
while we work.

18:27.541 --> 18:30.500
Could be a possible
pressure point if
you're captured.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.286
Either that,
or you just got a divorce.

18:33.286 --> 18:35.114
So we're leaving
for Paldoñia.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.985
You know anything
about it?

18:36.985 --> 18:38.378
Sure do.

18:38.378 --> 18:41.337
Paldoñia's like
a... Tim Burton movie.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.471
It's colorful,
but it's creepy as fuck.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.342
That's a new one.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.996
I have
an exclusive interview

18:47.996 --> 18:50.651
with President
Juan Arturo Venegas.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.349
He doesn't do interviews.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.831
Um, with all due respect,
do you understand
at all who--

18:56.831 --> 18:58.963
I think I understand
quite well,

18:58.963 --> 19:00.748
but the real question is
do you understand

19:00.748 --> 19:02.445
why you're coming along?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.449
My guess is not
to give my opinion

19:06.449 --> 19:08.321
about Juan Arturo Venegas.

19:08.321 --> 19:11.367
Perfect. Then this
will be fine.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.239
I'll focus on Venegas.
You focus on making sure

19:13.239 --> 19:15.850
I don't get robbed
or kidnapped at the hotel.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.508
Pull!

19:24.641 --> 19:26.339
What's up,
what's up?

19:26.339 --> 19:29.516
Welcome back to
"Infamous Daily Live."

19:29.516 --> 19:31.082
I'm here with
GG Love,

19:31.082 --> 19:33.302
who went
from doing time

19:33.302 --> 19:35.522
to being
a multimillionaire entrepreneur

19:35.522 --> 19:38.133
and founder of
the Much Loved
clothing brand.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.874
Thanks for
being here, GG.

19:39.874 --> 19:41.571
Pleasure's all mines, baby.

19:41.571 --> 19:44.574
Give us a spin.
Show off what you got.

19:44.574 --> 19:47.534
Wow! I can't wait
to get one.

19:47.534 --> 19:48.839
So tell me...

19:48.839 --> 19:50.014
- Have a good laugh?
- Oh, shit!

19:53.496 --> 19:55.324
Was that all
an Internet search
could get you?

19:55.324 --> 19:57.544
Trust me. There's
far worse out there.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.372
Did you move
to the States
when you were young?

19:59.372 --> 20:01.417
I noticed your
British passport
when we boarded,

20:01.417 --> 20:03.593
and you slipped
your accent, so...

20:03.593 --> 20:05.291
probably moved here
as a kid.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.335
I mean, if I had
to guess.

20:06.335 --> 20:07.815
Nobody's asking
for your guesses.

20:09.251 --> 20:13.168
Why Paldoñia?
Some sort of
image makeover?

20:13.168 --> 20:15.301
This might shock you,
my dear,

20:15.301 --> 20:17.172
but I didn't take
a degree at Oxford

20:17.172 --> 20:20.219
to cover celebrity
bar mitzvahs.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.221
Paldoñia has some
of the largest oil

20:22.221 --> 20:23.918
and natural gas fields
in the world,

20:23.918 --> 20:26.137
and Venegas is
the last pure autocrat

20:26.137 --> 20:29.663
in the Western Hemisphere,
and he doesn't do interviews

20:29.663 --> 20:31.142
until now.

20:33.275 --> 20:37.061
OK. Just...

20:37.061 --> 20:40.282
just want me to sit
here and shut up then?

20:40.282 --> 20:42.980
Sounds absolutely brilliant.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.452
Miss Wellington,
welcome to Paldoñia!

21:19.452 --> 21:22.542
President Venegas,
so nice to meet... you.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.198
Ellie sends
her regards.

21:27.198 --> 21:30.550
Oh, my God.
You are even more beautiful

21:30.550 --> 21:32.769
in person than
on television.

21:32.769 --> 21:36.643
- Thank you.
- Hoo. Ha ha ha!

21:38.166 --> 21:39.515
It's like that?

21:41.604 --> 21:43.084
Oh. That--
that was a gift.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.482
What? I have a permit
for that.

21:49.482 --> 21:51.745
Before we begin,
we must take a selfie.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.312
Oh. Um...

21:55.096 --> 21:57.707
- Ah. Yes.
- That's--um--

21:57.707 --> 21:59.100
It's a little bright
out here.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.362
- Yes?
- Oh. Oh!

22:00.362 --> 22:04.148
You approve? Yes.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.411
- Ahh!
- It's great.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.151
My followers are
gonna love this.

22:12.722 --> 22:14.245
Use the whole fist?

22:18.772 --> 22:20.904
I bought that one. Yeah.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.602
So Ellie and you
were roommates

22:22.602 --> 22:24.038
in the university, yes?

22:24.038 --> 22:25.822
Our second
and fourth years, yes.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.868
Hmm. Heh heh.

22:27.868 --> 22:30.958
Well, any friend
of Ellie's is welcome
in Paldoñia.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.569
Tell me about her.
How is she?

22:33.569 --> 22:35.745
Well, um...

22:37.443 --> 22:40.054
she is very happy
in Kansas.

22:40.054 --> 22:42.665
I know. What's
in Kansas anyway?

22:42.665 --> 22:44.624
The rich rancher
she married.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.365
What a pity.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.715
Not in Kansas
anymore, huh?

22:51.718 --> 22:53.502
Was it a bad joke?

22:53.502 --> 22:54.982
No.
"The Wizard of Oz."

22:54.982 --> 22:56.505
It's one of my
favorite movies.

22:56.505 --> 22:57.767
I should have
introduced you.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.595
Mason is
my protective detail.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.944
Of course he is.
Of course.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.338
Mason Pettits,
CDI's finest,

23:03.338 --> 23:06.689
former Army
Special Forces, right?

23:06.689 --> 23:10.476
Maison Petite.
The little house.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.348
We do our own
research, too.

23:13.348 --> 23:16.395
Ha ha ha! Ha!

23:16.395 --> 23:18.614
Vamanos!

23:53.519 --> 23:56.347
Would you like to ride
my stallion?

23:56.347 --> 23:58.959
Not now, thanks.

23:58.959 --> 24:01.135
President Venegas,
I really appreciate you

24:01.135 --> 24:02.484
giving me this kind
of access.

24:02.484 --> 24:04.225
Ho ho! Of course.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.618
It's like they say.

24:05.618 --> 24:08.969
A blind pig must
use its nose.

24:08.969 --> 24:11.624
Ah. Ha ha.

24:11.624 --> 24:15.454
There are so many
wonderful things
about my country.

24:15.454 --> 24:18.413
I can't wait for you
to share them with the world.

24:42.524 --> 24:46.310
Look. Mi gente.
My people.

24:57.017 --> 25:01.108
There is a bright future
ahead of us, bright future.

25:05.895 --> 25:08.071
Heh.

25:08.071 --> 25:10.596
Ha ha. Freedom of speech
is very present in Paldoñia,

25:10.596 --> 25:12.293
but let's move on.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.208
Vamos. Vamos.
Adelante. Adelante.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.616
Just confirming.
We are still headed

25:30.616 --> 25:32.400
to your ranch
tonight, right?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.576
I am taking you
to my country estate.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.317
I think you're
gonna love it.

25:38.188 --> 25:40.060
Let's toast, huh?

25:40.060 --> 25:41.365
- OK.
- Yes.

25:41.365 --> 25:43.846
Ha ha! One for you,

25:43.846 --> 25:47.371
one for me,

25:47.371 --> 25:52.594
and we toast
for your safe travels...

25:52.594 --> 25:54.553
and for new friends.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.728
- I like it.
- Yes.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.251
Ah, ah, ah.

25:57.251 --> 25:58.992
- Arriba...
- Arriba...

25:58.992 --> 26:00.471
- abajo...
- abajo...

26:00.471 --> 26:02.125
- al centro...
- al centro...

26:02.125 --> 26:04.345
- pa' dentro.
- OK. Ha ha ha!

26:05.564 --> 26:08.262
- Ahh.
- Ahem. Heh.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.307
Uh, if you don't mind,
Mr. President,

26:10.307 --> 26:12.266
I'd love to go over a few
of my interview questions

26:12.266 --> 26:14.355
- with you now.
- Yes, of course.

26:14.355 --> 26:17.401
No prepararse
es prepararse para fallar.

26:17.401 --> 26:20.317
Failing to prepare
is preparing to fail?

26:20.317 --> 26:23.843
- Ooh. I love it.
- Ha ha ha!

26:31.590 --> 26:33.243
Ha ha ha!

26:33.243 --> 26:34.941
Be ready to fail, huh?

26:34.941 --> 26:36.595
I--ohh!

26:44.385 --> 26:45.778
What are we gonna
do, Mason?

26:49.782 --> 26:51.914
Mason!

26:56.136 --> 26:58.355
Oh, my God!

27:03.186 --> 27:05.885
- Aah!
- Stay down!

27:05.885 --> 27:07.451
- Aah, Mason!
- Get down!

27:07.451 --> 27:08.844
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

27:10.454 --> 27:12.500
No, no, no, no, no!

27:15.372 --> 27:16.809
Mason?

27:19.072 --> 27:20.508
- What's happening?
- Stay down!

27:31.432 --> 27:34.696
Oh! Ohh!

27:36.524 --> 27:38.395
Aah!

27:40.006 --> 27:41.398
What are you doing?

27:50.451 --> 27:51.670
Oh, shit!

27:54.281 --> 27:55.761
- Get up. Get up.
- What?

27:55.761 --> 27:57.414
Get up. Put your
seatbelts on now.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.633
Oh, God.

28:08.295 --> 28:09.688
Unh!
Ohh!

28:24.746 --> 28:27.488
Ooh! Ow!

28:27.488 --> 28:31.840
Claire, are you OK?
Yes? Yes.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.062
Told you this
was mine.

28:36.062 --> 28:38.238
OK, OK.

28:40.153 --> 28:43.025
Hey. OK. Stay here.

28:43.025 --> 28:44.505
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.250
Huh!

29:04.568 --> 29:06.745
Man.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.094
Hey.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.751
What part of "stay here"
did you guys not get?

29:35.425 --> 29:37.732
Oh, my back. Ohh.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.473
Oh. Just...

29:41.605 --> 29:43.216
OK. OK.

29:43.216 --> 29:45.044
- Mr. Pettits.
- OK.

29:45.044 --> 29:47.611
- Thank you very much.
- God! Ohh! My back!

29:47.611 --> 29:48.961
- Ahh. My back.
- Are you OK?

29:48.961 --> 29:50.745
Yeah. Just give me
a second.

29:50.745 --> 29:52.616
Are you sure you're OK?
You want a massage?

29:54.662 --> 29:56.185
OK.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.621
What the hell
just happened?

29:57.621 --> 29:58.971
What happened?

29:58.971 --> 30:01.190
Your one-man
security detail happened.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.758
He's a hero.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.716
Mason, what's going on?

30:05.716 --> 30:07.109
What's going on?
This place is

30:07.109 --> 30:08.458
a shitshow like
it always was.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.851
We never
should have come.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.331
Let's go.

30:11.331 --> 30:13.289
Should we call
for help?

30:13.289 --> 30:15.335
Yeah, but we'll
call when we're
someplace safe.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.728
Ahem. Can you
believe this?

30:17.728 --> 30:18.991
What?

30:18.991 --> 30:20.209
C'est un coup d'état.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.558
A coup?

30:21.558 --> 30:23.604
Putana! Merde!

30:23.604 --> 30:25.649
I cannot hide
from this!

30:25.649 --> 30:30.045
Ha! Hiding seems
like a great idea
right now.

30:30.045 --> 30:33.875
This is not a rebel
assassination attempt.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.486
One, really looks
like it is.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.185
Two, you're screwed
regardless, so...

30:39.185 --> 30:41.491
I have to stop this.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.058
I think I just did.

30:43.058 --> 30:46.018
Stop the overthrow
of my government,

30:46.018 --> 30:48.759
and you will come
with me to the capital

30:48.759 --> 30:50.892
and help me protect
my people.

30:50.892 --> 30:54.287
Newsflash--your people
just tried to kill you,
all right?

30:54.287 --> 30:56.419
Count us out.

30:56.419 --> 30:57.507
Can you hand me my bag?

30:57.507 --> 30:59.596
- What?
- My bags.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.729
We gotta get you out of here
by the end of the day.

31:01.729 --> 31:02.817
You're never gonna
need it.

31:02.817 --> 31:03.862
I'm with the president
of a country

31:03.862 --> 31:05.211
in the middle
of a coup.

31:05.211 --> 31:07.126
This is the scoop
of a lifetime.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.215
You gotta be alive to have
the scoop of a lifetime, OK?

31:09.215 --> 31:11.043
You'll break your story
when you're someplace safe.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.444
- What's that?
- A really big gun.

31:21.444 --> 31:22.750
Let's move.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.670
Come on.

31:29.670 --> 31:30.889
Ohh!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.776
Battement tendu.

31:51.997 --> 31:53.781
En pointe.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.787
Yes.

32:02.529 --> 32:03.791
How's it?

32:06.098 --> 32:07.751
Everyone?

32:07.751 --> 32:09.362
Yes. Excellent.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.322
Sorry. Go ahead.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.283
I see.

32:17.283 --> 32:18.762
Be in touch then.

32:23.071 --> 32:26.161
Brava, brava, Marta.
The swan.

32:29.686 --> 32:33.081
Papa has to go
to work my dear.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.344
Encore, encore!

32:43.831 --> 32:45.006
Shit.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.881
Wait, wait, Mason.

32:50.881 --> 32:53.754
I c--I can't,
I can't, I can't.

32:53.754 --> 32:57.584
I can't. Ohh.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.716
I guess we're
taking a break.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.415
Ohh.

33:02.415 --> 33:05.026
Are you OK,
Miss Wellington?

33:05.026 --> 33:07.115
- I'm good.
- Oh, good.

33:07.115 --> 33:10.031
So who's trying
to kill us?

33:10.031 --> 33:12.207
Nobody. Nobody is
trying to kill us.

33:12.207 --> 33:13.730
They're trying to
kill him.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.995
Who wants
to kill you?

33:17.299 --> 33:18.692
Ah.

33:18.692 --> 33:21.912
A single insect may bring
down an entire country.

33:21.912 --> 33:24.132
Which insect wants
to kill you today ?

33:24.132 --> 33:26.352
I don't know,
but I intend to find out.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.185
Oh. You have
a satellite phone.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.490
Who you gonna call?

33:34.490 --> 33:35.926
I'm calling for help.

33:38.886 --> 33:40.583
- Earle.
- Yo. It's Mason. We got hit.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.542
Shit! What happened?
You OK, Mason?

33:42.542 --> 33:43.978
Heading out of town,
they took out our vehicles.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.936
I got us out safe,
but I--

33:45.936 --> 33:47.721
bro, we're stuck.
I got no idea
where we're at.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.157
Is Wellington safe?

33:49.157 --> 33:50.724
Yeah. She's with me,
and Venegas

33:50.724 --> 33:52.334
is here, too.

33:52.334 --> 33:54.858
What? Why is he
with you?

33:54.858 --> 33:56.164
What about his team?

33:56.164 --> 33:59.298
Dead. Bro, you got to
get us a ride.

33:59.298 --> 34:01.039
Hang tight.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.084
GPS has your position.

34:03.084 --> 34:06.740
There's a clearing...
3 klicks east.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.481
Exfil there by helo.

34:08.481 --> 34:09.960
I'm gonna call some
colleagues in the area.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.745
I'll get you picked up.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.573
Heh. So much for a milk run.

34:15.618 --> 34:17.664
- May I use your phone?
- Nope.

34:17.664 --> 34:18.795
But I need to
make a call.

34:18.795 --> 34:20.928
Heh. I don't care.

34:20.928 --> 34:23.191
Mason.
- What?

34:23.191 --> 34:25.150
Tell me why I should do
a favor for him.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.934
Well, for example,
because, uh, I can have

34:26.934 --> 34:29.676
you arrested for
being a foreign spy.

34:29.676 --> 34:31.547
Maybe I pull a coup
of my own then.

34:31.547 --> 34:33.071
Stop it, Mason!

34:38.119 --> 34:40.078
Singing? Dictators
don't get to sing.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.776
Really? Well, then
go ahead.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.256
Do it, Mr. Pettits.

34:44.256 --> 34:45.953
I am not afraid
of death,

34:45.953 --> 34:48.042
and I am not afraid
of people like you.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.957
Do it.

34:52.394 --> 34:56.529
Hey, hey!
Put the gun down, please.

35:04.450 --> 35:06.147
Knock yourself out.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.628
Thank you.
Don't worry.

35:08.628 --> 35:11.196
I'll make it petite.

35:23.773 --> 35:25.384
Hermanos.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.689
Señor.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.780
-  Is this my speech?
- Yes.

35:38.701 --> 35:40.007
Is the lighting okay?

35:40.007 --> 35:42.966
The lighting is perfect, Jefe.

35:42.966 --> 35:44.490
Thank you, General.

35:45.055 --> 35:47.145

Hello?

35:58.895 --> 35:59.809
Jorge,

35:59.809 --> 36:01.289
Nephew!

36:01.289 --> 36:02.856
Uncle?

36:02.856 --> 36:04.292
Correct!

36:05.337 --> 36:07.948
I'm out here walking
through the jungle !

36:07.948 --> 36:09.341
How are you?

36:09.341 --> 36:10.559
All good?

36:11.081 --> 36:13.040
Heh. Ha ha!

36:13.693 --> 36:14.868
How are you, Uncle?

36:14.868 --> 36:16.348
I'm fantastic!

36:16.348 --> 36:18.045
I'm walking through the jungle

36:18.045 --> 36:20.265
with an absolutely lovely woman.

36:20.265 --> 36:22.223
- The Gringo Journalist?
- Yes !

36:22.223 --> 36:24.051
The beautiful Claire Wellington.

36:25.008 --> 36:26.488
- Uh-huh.
- Ah!

36:34.801 --> 36:36.455
Is he asking
what I'm wearing?

36:36.455 --> 36:38.979
No, he's describing
what you're wearing.

36:38.979 --> 36:41.416
Don't look at me.
He's your friend
of a friend.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.766
Yeah. Just didn't
realize he and Ellie

36:43.766 --> 36:45.333
kept in touch still.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.770
- What?
- The interview.

36:47.770 --> 36:49.729
That's obviously why
he invited me here.

36:49.729 --> 36:51.818
He invited you?

36:51.818 --> 36:53.123
Why? Because I'm not just

36:53.123 --> 36:54.603
a celebrity news
reporter to you now?

36:54.603 --> 36:57.040
No. I thought you
landed the interview.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.739
Ha! Everybody's asked
him for an interview,

36:59.739 --> 37:01.784
but Paldoñia's
been basically
a media blackout

37:01.784 --> 37:03.960
for the last decade.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.092
Then just like that,
he e-mailed me,

37:05.092 --> 37:06.659
asked me if I wanted
an interview.

37:06.659 --> 37:08.051
Why do you think
you're here?

37:08.051 --> 37:09.488
I'm not
totally clueless.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.318
Yes, yes,
don't worry. See you soon!

37:15.320 --> 37:17.060
We were all worried for you.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.063
Sure. Great. God bless you!

37:24.111 --> 37:26.069
My uncle isn't dead.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.944
Our partners
will not be pleased.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.393
Thank you.

37:45.393 --> 37:46.916
Please tell us you
have good news.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.527
Oh, I have
wonderful news.

37:48.527 --> 37:50.572
I was just talking
to Jorge, my nephew.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.096
He's the one
behind the coup.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.924
That's good news?

37:54.924 --> 37:56.448
Yes, it's great news.

37:56.448 --> 37:59.320
You see, I love my nephew,
but he's an idiot.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.322
So he--he just told you?

38:01.322 --> 38:02.715
No. he didn't tell
me anything,

38:02.715 --> 38:05.283
but he said
everything. Hmm?

38:05.283 --> 38:07.197
He will not move
a finger if he knows

38:07.197 --> 38:08.721
that I am still alive,

38:08.721 --> 38:11.114
so I told him that
everything was OK

38:11.114 --> 38:13.726
and that we were
gonna go to see him.

38:13.726 --> 38:16.468
You see, you must always
stroke the head

38:16.468 --> 38:18.948
that you are
going to cut off.

38:20.559 --> 38:22.256
So is he working
with the rebels?

38:22.256 --> 38:23.736
No, no, no, no.

38:23.736 --> 38:25.999
The rebels also think
that he's an idiot.

38:25.999 --> 38:28.001
Heh. Let's go.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.263
Back to the capital.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.831
Heh. No.

38:31.831 --> 38:33.746
No.

38:33.746 --> 38:35.835
Do what you want.

38:35.835 --> 38:37.489
We're getting
out of here.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.373
We can't just
leave him.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.896
Just did.

38:56.725 --> 38:59.554
I need to report this.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.469
We can't just let
another government

39:01.469 --> 39:03.471
in another poor
country get overthrown

39:03.471 --> 39:05.821
in another coup
and nobody pays attention.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.214
Come on. Don't let
Venegas suck you in.

39:07.214 --> 39:08.737
He's a textbook sociopath.

39:08.737 --> 39:10.304
He seems OK.

39:10.304 --> 39:11.653
Please.
Read Hannah Arendt.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.395
I have.

39:14.395 --> 39:16.876
I'm well aware what
the world expects

39:16.876 --> 39:18.878
from Claire Wellington
at the moment,

39:18.878 --> 39:20.532
but I have sacrificed everything

39:20.532 --> 39:24.405
for my career--my family,
relationships, my life--

39:24.405 --> 39:26.233
so forgive me
if I refuse to be

39:26.233 --> 39:28.017
the laughingstock who
went from winning a Peabody

39:28.017 --> 39:30.411
to covering
celebrity man caves.

39:30.411 --> 39:32.370
This is my chance,

39:32.370 --> 39:34.720
and it's working out
better than I ever
could have hoped.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.593
Yeah, it's one way
of looking at it.

39:40.726 --> 39:41.944
Err!

40:00.006 --> 40:01.964
Sebastian.

40:01.964 --> 40:04.140
Mason Pettits, we got
a call from your boss at CDI.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.012
Heard you needed a lift.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.492
Yeah, we sure do.

40:07.492 --> 40:10.016
Got an ETA
of two minutes for you.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.192
Got a spot where I can
set the bird down?

40:12.192 --> 40:13.933
Yeah, we're headed
towards the clearing
right now.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.065
Uh, you got my GPS?

40:16.065 --> 40:17.850
We're heading
straight for it.

40:17.850 --> 40:20.200
You can't get
here fast enough.
We'll be standing by.

40:21.723 --> 40:25.335
OK. Sit tight.
We're getting picked up
in a few minutes.

40:29.427 --> 40:30.732
Are you sure
we can't stay?

40:30.732 --> 40:32.473
Oh, I'm sure.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.301
Get you picked up
across the border.

40:34.301 --> 40:35.694
You'll find a Starbucks
with free Wi-Fi or something,

40:35.694 --> 40:38.261
break your story
from there.

40:38.261 --> 40:40.829
Sure sure?

40:40.829 --> 40:42.657
You can't get
a Peabody if you're dead.

40:44.485 --> 40:46.313
What about Venegas?
You think he'll be OK?

40:46.313 --> 40:48.968
I don't give
a shit about Venegas!

40:48.968 --> 40:51.710
What is your
deal with him?

41:15.951 --> 41:18.127
I can smell
the free Wi-Fi now.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.831
Not good.

41:25.831 --> 41:28.094
- Run! Run!
- What?!

41:57.993 --> 42:01.344
Aah!

42:10.789 --> 42:12.747
Aah!

42:17.491 --> 42:18.797
- Agh!
- Aah! Aah!

42:20.407 --> 42:22.104
Aah! Aah!

42:22.104 --> 42:23.497
Come on!

42:32.288 --> 42:33.681
Oh, God!

42:35.074 --> 42:36.945
Come on.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.120
Are you kidding me?

42:38.120 --> 42:40.079
Embrace the suck!

43:06.453 --> 43:07.933
Aah! Ohh! Ohh!

43:09.238 --> 43:10.805
Aah!

43:13.721 --> 43:16.463
Still excited
to cover a coup?

43:16.463 --> 43:18.421
- Less and less honestly.
- Yeah.

43:55.067 --> 43:57.112
Shit! he's going
for another round.

44:01.682 --> 44:03.031
Stay put.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.730
Tell me you got that.

44:51.993 --> 44:55.214
Run!

45:22.197 --> 45:24.025
Mason?

45:36.690 --> 45:38.474
Mason?

46:15.816 --> 46:17.557
Mason?

46:21.474 --> 46:23.432
Oh. Not Mason.

46:29.961 --> 46:32.528
Because hiding in a tree
is such a good idea.

46:59.947 --> 47:01.079
Huh!

47:21.012 --> 47:22.317
Are you OK?

47:22.317 --> 47:23.841
Yeah. I'm good.

47:25.930 --> 47:27.627
Do you need help?

47:27.627 --> 47:28.933
Enn.

47:45.732 --> 47:46.951
Ooh!

47:57.962 --> 48:00.442
You good? Ugh.

48:02.444 --> 48:05.491
Suddenly, I'm very glad
I paid you to tag along.

48:08.233 --> 48:09.930
Mason!

48:09.930 --> 48:11.149
- Unh!
- Aah!

48:13.020 --> 48:14.587
Where is Venegas?

48:15.980 --> 48:17.155
Aah!

48:22.029 --> 48:23.813
I'm here.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.903
Ohh!

48:25.903 --> 48:27.556
Aah!

48:27.556 --> 48:28.862
Puta!

48:30.255 --> 48:34.607
Oh. Miss Wellington,
I am--I am so sorry

48:34.607 --> 48:36.957
for the mess
that I have made.

48:36.957 --> 48:38.480
Thank you.

48:40.047 --> 48:41.962
Where did you
come from?

48:41.962 --> 48:43.659
From behind that tree.

48:45.096 --> 48:47.098
Not literally.

48:47.098 --> 48:48.795
What's up
with the hand cannon?

48:50.449 --> 48:52.712
- Juanita?
- Yeah.

48:52.712 --> 48:54.496
What kind of egomaniacal
psycho dictator

48:54.496 --> 48:57.456
would Venegas be if he
didn't have a big gun?

48:59.545 --> 49:01.242
Point taken.

49:05.681 --> 49:07.031
Thank you
for your help.

49:09.424 --> 49:11.470
You're welcome, Mr. Pettits.

49:39.063 --> 49:41.108
Colonel Koehorst.

49:48.115 --> 49:50.726
General Vásquez,

49:50.726 --> 49:52.598
my clients are very
disappointed that

49:52.598 --> 49:55.470
your uncle is still alive
and causing trouble.

49:55.470 --> 49:57.820
It would appear that
your men likewise

49:57.820 --> 49:59.605
failed to kill
my uncle.

49:59.605 --> 50:03.043
Certainly our
arrangement's off
to a shaky start.

50:03.043 --> 50:06.090
My clients need
assurance that

50:06.090 --> 50:09.658
their investment in
your country remains secure.

50:11.617 --> 50:13.488
Is that clear?

50:17.666 --> 50:20.408
Yes. Ahem.

50:20.408 --> 50:21.931
Good.

50:21.931 --> 50:23.585
Thank you.

50:23.585 --> 50:26.066
Better one man dies
instead of a thousand.

50:51.352 --> 50:53.398
Ahem.

50:56.227 --> 50:58.142
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

51:01.928 --> 51:03.451
Ahh.

51:07.194 --> 51:12.156
Well, this is
just... awesome.

51:12.156 --> 51:13.331
Yeah.

51:17.117 --> 51:19.424
So how'd you get
wounded?

51:19.424 --> 51:22.340
Your back. Saw you've
been favoring it.

51:25.212 --> 51:26.953
God, I'm sorry
for trying to have

51:26.953 --> 51:28.868
a human moment with you
in the middle of a jungle

51:28.868 --> 51:31.088
where we could die
at any second.

51:36.963 --> 51:39.487
Mission I was on
went sideways
a while back.

51:41.272 --> 51:45.014
I got injured.
My back hurts.

51:45.014 --> 51:47.016
Did that happen here?

51:47.016 --> 51:48.322
Yeah.

51:49.715 --> 51:51.586
It was my last mission.

51:54.981 --> 51:58.941
And so you're married...
or were married?

51:58.941 --> 52:01.248
I didn't quite follow
with the ring thing.

52:01.248 --> 52:04.164
Heh.

52:06.035 --> 52:07.254
Yes.

52:08.777 --> 52:10.779
Probably separated
by now.

52:10.779 --> 52:13.130
Hmm.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.653
I was just way better
at being an operator

52:14.653 --> 52:17.395
than I am at normal,
day-to-day life.

52:18.483 --> 52:20.876
Then I got hurt,
then I got out,

52:20.876 --> 52:23.575
and then
I just sucked.

52:23.575 --> 52:26.099
I got low.

52:28.101 --> 52:31.017
Took me years to
figure out how
to become a lawyer.

52:31.017 --> 52:32.584
Wait. You're a lawyer?

52:32.584 --> 52:34.107
Yeah. Officially.

52:34.107 --> 52:35.282
Passed the Bar,
whole 9.

52:35.282 --> 52:37.458
Ha!

52:37.458 --> 52:39.199
Thought it would make
me feel more normal.

52:39.199 --> 52:40.853
Mmm.

52:40.853 --> 52:44.117
Turns out it just made me
hate myself more.

52:44.117 --> 52:46.728
So you got into
private security?

52:46.728 --> 52:48.121
Yeah.

52:48.121 --> 52:50.167
How long you been
doing that now?

52:50.167 --> 52:53.518
Uh, it's what, 5...

52:53.518 --> 52:55.824
4...3 days?

52:55.824 --> 52:59.611
What? CDI said
you were their best.

52:59.611 --> 53:01.439
You saw me take out
a helicopter.

53:01.439 --> 53:04.746
I mean, I think you
got your money's
worth, right?

53:04.746 --> 53:06.922
I mean, come on.
That was--

53:06.922 --> 53:08.620
that was pretty cool.

53:11.449 --> 53:13.668
That was pretty
damn cool.

53:33.253 --> 53:35.386
Uh, we should go around.

53:35.386 --> 53:36.909
How rude would
that be?

53:36.909 --> 53:38.258
It probably isn't safe.

53:38.258 --> 53:39.912
It's very safe.

53:39.912 --> 53:42.828
Welcome to Sabrina,
my home.

53:48.834 --> 53:49.922
Heh heh.

53:56.276 --> 53:58.322
- Ahh. Ha!
- Ha ha ha!

54:02.804 --> 54:04.284
Claire, Mason,

54:04.284 --> 54:06.547
this is my oldest friend
Ernesto Sandoval.

54:06.547 --> 54:09.071
He is the leader
of this village.

54:09.071 --> 54:11.073
It's an honor.

54:15.904 --> 54:18.255
Oh! Oh!

54:21.214 --> 54:23.608
You're much more
beautiful than on TV.

54:26.175 --> 54:27.220
The Hulk.

54:27.699 --> 54:29.309
The Hulk scares me.

54:33.313 --> 54:34.662
What did he say?

54:34.662 --> 54:35.663
Something funny,
I guess.

54:35.663 --> 54:37.230
This is Pepino.

54:37.230 --> 54:38.710
He is the, the son-in-law
of the chief.

54:38.710 --> 54:40.668
He will give us a ride
into town tomorrow.

54:40.668 --> 54:42.496
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, Mason.

54:42.496 --> 54:43.976
Nobody travels
in this region

54:43.976 --> 54:45.325
of the country
at night.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.500
Not even mercenaries.

54:46.500 --> 54:48.023
Consider it a chance
to rest

54:48.023 --> 54:50.156
and wash off the blood.

54:50.156 --> 54:51.375
OK.

54:53.246 --> 54:54.508
Uh...

55:09.436 --> 55:10.742
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God!

55:10.742 --> 55:12.178
Ha ha ha!

55:12.178 --> 55:13.048
- I just--
- I didn't--

55:13.048 --> 55:14.136
didn't see anything.

55:14.136 --> 55:15.747
Whew!

55:15.747 --> 55:18.271
Oh. Hoo!

55:18.271 --> 55:20.360
Nice ink, woman.

55:22.971 --> 55:26.235
Color me impressed,
Mr. Pettits.

55:26.235 --> 55:28.281
Not petite at all.

55:29.761 --> 55:31.806
Shall we do
the interview?

55:31.806 --> 55:33.330
Huh?

55:47.561 --> 55:49.650
So what do you want
me to do again?

55:49.650 --> 55:52.914
Just a standard
two-shot.

55:52.914 --> 55:56.483
Didn't exactly learn
that in basic training.

55:56.483 --> 56:00.269
Just make sure we're
both in the frame.

56:00.269 --> 56:02.837
- Shall we begin?
- Please.

56:06.406 --> 56:07.799
OK. Let me just...

56:07.799 --> 56:09.409
We're rolling?

56:09.409 --> 56:11.716
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:14.762 --> 56:17.243
President Venegas,
thank you for
speaking to me

56:17.243 --> 56:20.638
about the events that
have transpired over
the past 12 hours.

56:20.638 --> 56:22.204
I truly appreciate
the opportunity

56:22.204 --> 56:24.119
of speaking with you.

56:24.119 --> 56:25.991
The world will soon
learn that earlier

56:25.991 --> 56:27.775
this morning you survived
an assassination attempt

56:27.775 --> 56:28.950
that resulted
in the deaths

56:28.950 --> 56:31.431
of your entire
security team.

56:31.431 --> 56:33.390
Sadly, yes.

56:33.390 --> 56:36.958
Who do you think
is behind this
attempted coup?

56:36.958 --> 56:39.352
Our land and its mineral
resources have been exploited

56:39.352 --> 56:42.050
by outsiders
for a very long time,

56:42.050 --> 56:43.661
and it is no secret
that these outsiders

56:43.661 --> 56:46.794
have propped up
my presidency for many years

56:46.794 --> 56:49.318
while I turned
my back on my people.

56:49.318 --> 56:52.060
The CIA, the SAS,
they're only a tool

56:52.060 --> 56:55.107
to influence leaders
like me in countries
like mine,

56:55.107 --> 56:56.935
but the real power has
always been in the hands

56:56.935 --> 57:00.242
of CEOs and shareholders
that make billions

57:00.242 --> 57:03.332
out of our natural resources
on the back of my people.

57:03.332 --> 57:07.075
So the corporations
were behind the attempt
on your life?

57:07.075 --> 57:09.208
I was with you.
The attackers seemed like

57:09.208 --> 57:11.166
professional soldiers.

57:11.166 --> 57:13.691
What can't these
people buy, Claire?

57:13.691 --> 57:16.563
You think
an assassination
attempt is scary?

57:16.563 --> 57:18.739
Try telling the CEO
of a global energy company

57:18.739 --> 57:21.133
to go fuck his mother
and watch your currency drop

57:21.133 --> 57:24.789
70% by the end
of the conference call.

57:24.789 --> 57:28.053
Paldoñia has been blessed
with a second chance.

57:30.403 --> 57:34.015
In my fists are lanthanides,

57:34.015 --> 57:36.496
rare earth metals that
are the core component

57:36.496 --> 57:39.804
for every new technology,
cell phones, tablets,

57:39.804 --> 57:41.980
electric cars,
MRI machines.

57:41.980 --> 57:43.634
These corporations,
they want to exploit

57:43.634 --> 57:45.940
our new resource by
a pittance of what it's worth,

57:45.940 --> 57:48.465
and I have told them
that I will not allow it,

57:48.465 --> 57:49.944
which is why they're
trying to kill me.

57:49.944 --> 57:53.121
Paldoñia will become
the number one provider

57:53.121 --> 57:56.473
of the world's
most precious metal.

57:56.734 --> 57:59.214
My promise,
and my legacy

57:59.214 --> 58:01.695
is that wealth from these metals

58:01.695 --> 58:04.219
will be invested solely
and exclusively

58:04.219 --> 58:07.266
to enrich the people
of Paldonia.

58:07.266 --> 58:08.702
Long Live Paldonia!

58:15.579 --> 58:18.103
Quite a puff
piece you got here.

58:18.103 --> 58:19.408
Yeah.

58:26.198 --> 58:27.852
The bridge.
Here they come.

58:27.852 --> 58:29.331
Do you remember that?

58:29.331 --> 58:32.247
You come back.
Ba ba ba ba! Take that!

58:40.342 --> 58:41.866
Right?

58:41.866 --> 58:44.521
I'm telling you.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.044
- You saved my life.
Yes.

58:46.044 --> 58:47.654
Very impressive.

59:00.101 --> 59:02.495
Whoo!

59:02.495 --> 59:04.758
Más, más.

59:28.303 --> 59:31.176
Bravo! Bravo!

59:53.677 --> 59:56.331
Y-you don't have to sleep
in a chair, Mason.

59:56.331 --> 59:57.985
I've slept in worse.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:06.298
Want to play a game to
see who gets the bed?

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:12.217
OK. If you know
what this is,

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:14.611
I'm gonna be
in trouble.

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:19.093
That's a mandala.

01:00:19.093 --> 01:00:22.096
I'm guessing you got it
in India,

01:00:22.096 --> 01:00:23.489
work trip.

01:00:24.795 --> 01:00:28.189
Ha. OK.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:30.409
OK.

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:34.848
This is Latin.

01:00:34.848 --> 01:00:38.156
"She flies
with her own wings."

01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:39.853
That's Latin?
It, um--

01:00:39.853 --> 01:00:41.594
ahem--it's cool.

01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:43.596
Yeah. I got it
a few years ago

01:00:43.596 --> 01:00:46.599
as a reminder
that everything's
gonna work out fine.

01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:49.776
And why would you need
that reminder,

01:00:49.776 --> 01:00:52.474
aside from being here
with an inexperienced bodyguard

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:54.041
and being hunted
by mercenaries?

01:00:54.041 --> 01:00:57.088
Oh. Ttt, ttt, tt.

01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.437
Stop.

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:03.007
Um... heh.

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:04.704
Can you see that?

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:08.186
Yep. Uh, anarchy?

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:11.232
What, do you not
believe in any form
of government?

01:01:11.232 --> 01:01:14.627
I didn't when
I was a teenager.

01:01:14.627 --> 01:01:17.412
I was very rebellious.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:18.762
I can buy that.

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.981
Hmm. It got me
into journalism,

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:24.071
you know,
confronting power,

01:01:24.071 --> 01:01:27.988
fighting governments
to get to the truth.

01:01:27.988 --> 01:01:30.643
What's not to love?

01:01:30.643 --> 01:01:32.166
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

01:01:32.166 --> 01:01:33.864
So whatever you thought,

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:35.604
I came here
for the chance

01:01:35.604 --> 01:01:37.084
to confront
a dictator

01:01:37.084 --> 01:01:38.607
and hold power
to account.

01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:39.913
That's why
I came here.

01:01:39.913 --> 01:01:43.090
Not for my career.

01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.571
Maybe a little bit
for my career.

01:01:45.571 --> 01:01:47.747
Heh.

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.706
Now, you tell
me something.

01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:53.710
Good night.

01:01:58.192 --> 01:02:00.325
Are you enjoying this?

01:02:00.325 --> 01:02:03.241
I'm just doing my job.

01:02:03.241 --> 01:02:05.722
Yeah. Me, too.

01:02:07.158 --> 01:02:09.464
I c--I can't.
Ahem. I can't.

01:02:13.425 --> 01:02:15.862
You still love her.

01:02:15.862 --> 01:02:17.342
Yeah.

01:02:23.696 --> 01:02:25.872
Timing, right?

01:02:25.872 --> 01:02:28.614
- Yeah. The worst.
- Ha ha ha!

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:33.227
Good night, Mr. Pettits.

01:02:35.795 --> 01:02:37.536
Good night,
Miss Wellington.

01:02:57.904 --> 01:02:59.732
Morning.

01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:02.300
Yo. We got to go.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.910
Heh.

01:03:06.173 --> 01:03:08.219
Aww. You're still
not gonna let me go

01:03:08.219 --> 01:03:10.787
to Puerto Santiago
to tell this story, huh?

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.919
That's a negative.
You got your exclusive.

01:03:12.919 --> 01:03:16.053
We get you to safety,
you break your story.

01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:18.316
Do you think I have
enough of a story?

01:03:18.316 --> 01:03:21.841
I mean, yes, I have
Venegas telling his side,

01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:24.191
but it could
still be dismissed
as the rantings

01:03:24.191 --> 01:03:26.193
of a dictator
trying to explain away

01:03:26.193 --> 01:03:27.542
a popular revolt.

01:03:27.542 --> 01:03:28.805
That is true.

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.591
The world has always
been largely apathetic

01:03:32.591 --> 01:03:34.332
towards my country.

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:38.292
That has served many well
but not my people.

01:03:38.292 --> 01:03:41.034
That is why today I am
going to Puerto Santiago

01:03:41.034 --> 01:03:42.862
for the future
of my people.

01:03:42.862 --> 01:03:44.777
Very inspiring.
I'm just gonna move

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:46.735
the delusions of saving
your people to the back burner

01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:49.347
and not getting us killed
to the front burner.

01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:53.003
Why are you here, Mason?

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:54.918
- What?
- Yes.

01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:57.921
Why are you here
in Paldoñia?

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.531
For her.
To protect her.

01:03:59.531 --> 01:04:02.142
Really? That's why you
think you're here?

01:04:02.142 --> 01:04:04.014
Hmm. For such
a cynical man,

01:04:04.014 --> 01:04:07.017
you are hopelessly
naive, Mason.

01:04:07.017 --> 01:04:12.196
Out of all places,
you were sent here.

01:04:14.372 --> 01:04:16.461
The question
is why, Mason.

01:04:43.749 --> 01:04:45.229
Yo. It's Mason.

01:04:45.229 --> 01:04:47.361
Mace. Are you OK?
I'm freaking out here.

01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:48.972
Yeah. What's the story, bro?

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.712
You sent me down here
because you thought
I'd roll over?

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:52.758
Maybe I was too big
of a mess to handle it?

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:54.368
Because I, like, owned
a bunch of these dudes.

01:04:54.368 --> 01:04:56.457
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, man.

01:04:56.457 --> 01:04:58.459
You really gonna try
to convince me you sent me

01:04:58.459 --> 01:05:00.940
down here randomly
to meet the guy who
killed half our friends,

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.376
and then the day I get
here, by coincidence,

01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:03.943
there's a coup with a bunch
of South Africans?

01:05:03.943 --> 01:05:05.771
It should be great.

01:05:05.771 --> 01:05:07.991
Mace, it's not what
you think, all right?

01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:09.601
Just breathe.

01:05:09.601 --> 01:05:12.125
- I love you like a brother.
- Yeah?

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.475
The only thing I can't
figure out is why you
needed me down here.

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:19.480
They wanted you
to dispose of him.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:20.786
Kill Venegas?

01:05:20.786 --> 01:05:22.614
At his ranch.

01:05:22.614 --> 01:05:24.616
One of his bodyguards
was gonna get you a gun,

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:26.183
sneak you
into his bedroom.

01:05:26.183 --> 01:05:27.706
Yeah, but why me?

01:05:27.706 --> 01:05:29.447
I thought it'd be a gift
to take out the guy

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:30.883
who killed our brothers,

01:05:30.883 --> 01:05:32.885
but apparently
his nephew thought Venegas

01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:35.322
was hip to it,
and he jumped the gun.

01:05:35.322 --> 01:05:36.715
I never would've sent
you down there

01:05:36.715 --> 01:05:38.891
if I thought there was
gonna be a coup.

01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:40.980
Seb, what kind of
insanity have you
gotten yourself into?

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.549
Look. Security contracting,

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:47.117
you deal with
some shady people.

01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:48.640
Some of it
rubs off on you.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.424
Who are these people?
Who paid you?

01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:52.731
The South Africans
are contractors, too.

01:05:52.731 --> 01:05:55.952
They approached me
when the Wellington
interview happened.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:58.258
They--they--they rep
people who want to
take control of the--

01:05:58.258 --> 01:06:00.695
- The lanthanides.
- Right.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.567
Mace, there's
an easy fix here.

01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:04.264
Put a bullet in Venegas.

01:06:04.264 --> 01:06:05.613
Do it for
the guys we lost.

01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:07.441
Do it for his country.

01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.747
Do it
for the world.

01:06:10.183 --> 01:06:13.404
Mace? Ma--

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:30.812
Hello?

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:31.857
Honey?

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:33.032
Hi, Daddy.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:35.600
Hey. Uh...

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:38.472
hey. I, um--I just
wanted to tell you

01:06:38.472 --> 01:06:39.952
that I love you
and Mommy so much.

01:06:39.952 --> 01:06:42.041
I love you too, Daddy.

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.869
Daddy, Mommy is sad.

01:06:43.869 --> 01:06:46.176
You should come home.

01:06:46.176 --> 01:06:47.655
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:47.655 --> 01:06:48.917
I--I promise I'll
be home soon.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.310
Hey. Is--is Mommy there?

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:51.790
Can you put Mom on
the phone right now?

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:54.662
OK, but she told Grandma
that she doesn't

01:06:54.662 --> 01:06:56.447
want to talk to you
again until you get

01:06:56.447 --> 01:06:57.839
your shit together.

01:06:57.839 --> 01:07:00.059
Heh. Ahem.

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:02.061
Just put mom
on the phone, sweetheart.

01:07:02.061 --> 01:07:04.716
Mommy! Daddy's
on the phone.

01:07:04.716 --> 01:07:05.630
OK, honey.
You go get ready.

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:06.979
OK.

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:10.722
- Mason?
- Hey.

01:07:10.722 --> 01:07:12.202
Where are you?

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:13.986
I'm just in a shop
getting Casey something.

01:07:13.986 --> 01:07:15.988
Listen. Um...

01:07:18.599 --> 01:07:22.125
I just wanted to
say thank you

01:07:22.125 --> 01:07:23.561
for sticking with me
through all this

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:25.998
and that I love
you very much.

01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:28.957
Oh. OK. I mean,
you're kind of
scaring me,

01:07:28.957 --> 01:07:30.263
- uh, with that.
- No, no.

01:07:30.263 --> 01:07:32.700
It's, it's--don't worry.
Don't worry.

01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:34.267
I love you.

01:07:34.267 --> 01:07:38.967
I--I love you,
too, so much.

01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:43.494
Please just come
home in one piece.

01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:45.800
- I'm on my way.
- OK.

01:07:50.588 --> 01:07:52.285
Thank God for that.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.126
So as you
walk to this--

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:09.346
All right. I'll use
some of the skirt. Yes.

01:08:09.346 --> 01:08:11.739
You walk into
position right here,

01:08:11.739 --> 01:08:13.045
and then you go like

01:08:13.045 --> 01:08:15.265
Mason?

01:08:15.265 --> 01:08:16.875
Hey.

01:08:16.875 --> 01:08:18.355
We're heading
for the border tonight.

01:08:18.355 --> 01:08:19.704
- What?
- What?

01:08:19.704 --> 01:08:20.835
We're leaving,
and that's that.

01:08:20.835 --> 01:08:22.054
- No, no. Wait.
- Hey!

01:08:22.054 --> 01:08:24.056
Don't give me a reason.

01:08:27.581 --> 01:08:29.105
Ohh!

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.429
Where's Venegas?

01:08:54.782 --> 01:08:57.089
Venegas!

01:08:58.003 --> 01:08:59.744
Venegas!

01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:01.224
Dude, stop
following us already.

01:09:01.224 --> 01:09:02.660
I could say
the same thing to you,

01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:04.009
but I have much
better manners.

01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:05.880
Mi amigo has a car.
Come on!

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.360
I said,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.971
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:13.932 --> 01:09:14.846
I said,

01:09:14.846 --> 01:09:17.022
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.156
Nesto Sandoval.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:23.681
Where is President Venegas?

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.394
This is your car?

01:09:41.394 --> 01:09:43.570
Sí señor.

01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:45.224
It doesn't
look very fast.

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.878
What are we gonna
do with this thing?

01:09:53.058 --> 01:09:54.277
Where's Venegas?

01:10:05.984 --> 01:10:07.507
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:10:07.507 --> 01:10:08.943
Let him go.

01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:10.467
It's the only way
out of this.

01:10:10.467 --> 01:10:12.338
If they kill him here,
they kill every person

01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:14.514
in this village.

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.779
I hate you.

01:10:24.872 --> 01:10:26.396
Hey!

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:31.836
You're looking
for Venegas?

01:10:31.836 --> 01:10:34.360
Here is Venegas!

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:37.537
- Um...
- Can you ride?

01:10:37.537 --> 01:10:38.712
I'll manage.

01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:39.844
All right.

01:10:45.589 --> 01:10:46.720
OK. Hold on.

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.548
Huh! Ohh!

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:51.029
- OK.
- Oh.

01:10:57.557 --> 01:10:58.689
- Ohh!
- Get on.

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:00.299
- What?!
- Get on!

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.822
No, no! I am very
afraid of horses.

01:11:01.822 --> 01:11:03.476
Half of your pictures
are on horses.

01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:06.697
- It was Photoshopped.
- Err!

01:11:07.567 --> 01:11:10.135
Ohh! OK. OK.

01:11:10.135 --> 01:11:12.442
Let's go!

01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:14.922
Aah! Aah!

01:11:14.922 --> 01:11:19.710
OK. OK. Oh! OK.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:22.626
Ooh! Oh! Aah!

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:24.541
- Aah!
Claire, come on!

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.773
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:11:39.773 --> 01:11:41.514
Aah! Aah!

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:42.994
Hold onto my waist!

01:11:42.994 --> 01:11:45.126
Ohh! Aah!

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:47.085
This isn't weird at all.

01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:51.002
Let's go!
Get them!

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:00.794
Hang tight!

01:12:00.794 --> 01:12:02.579
Claire, this way!

01:12:02.579 --> 01:12:04.189
Wait, wait, wait!

01:12:14.591 --> 01:12:17.115
Claire, follow me!

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.813
Aah!

01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:27.386
- Aah!
- Hang on!

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:36.656
Stay there.
Stay there.

01:12:36.656 --> 01:12:38.876
Do not move.

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:42.096
Get up.
Come here. Come here.

01:12:42.096 --> 01:12:43.663
Stay still.

01:12:43.663 --> 01:12:45.361
Hello, Miss Wellington.

01:12:47.667 --> 01:12:49.452
May I call you Claire?

01:12:51.715 --> 01:12:52.977
Where's Claire?

01:12:52.977 --> 01:12:54.674
She was right
behind us.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.548
Oh.

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.639
Don't worry.

01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:06.469
They won't hurt her
if I'm still alive.

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:08.209
Looks like I'm going
to Puerto Santiago.

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:09.950
Excellent!

01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:14.738
Aah! What?!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.614
So you take money
to make private wars?

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:23.224
What's that like?

01:13:23.224 --> 01:13:25.705
Why don't you ask
your Green Beret?

01:13:25.705 --> 01:13:28.447
I would, but I seem
to have been kidnapped
by mercenaries.

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.884
Sweetheart,
we just saved you
from the worst dictator

01:13:30.884 --> 01:13:33.539
this continent
has ever seen.

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:35.498
I guess I missed
the chivalry while you were

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.716
shooting at me.

01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:39.066
We were shooting at him.

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:40.807
Our group has been
contracted on behalf

01:13:40.807 --> 01:13:43.767
of the people
of Paldoñia.

01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.377
You mean,
a corporate-backed coup

01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:46.900
of a sovereign nation?

01:13:46.900 --> 01:13:48.554
You know, most
journalists cause

01:13:48.554 --> 01:13:50.687
chaos and frenzy
but have no idea

01:13:50.687 --> 01:13:52.515
what's actually
going on.

01:13:52.515 --> 01:13:54.865
We are here to bring
stability and peace

01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:58.042
to a complicated situation.

01:13:58.042 --> 01:13:59.913
You really think that
your reporting

01:13:59.913 --> 01:14:03.003
can change the will
of the powerful?

01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:05.832
This might sound crazy,
but, yes, I do.

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.834
- Kind of part of the gig.
- It certainly sounds nice,

01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:09.270
and I wish you were
right, Claire.

01:14:09.270 --> 01:14:10.750
I really do.

01:14:10.750 --> 01:14:13.100
Unfortunately,
people are foolish.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:14.580
People just want honesty.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.973
They don't know
what they want.

01:14:15.973 --> 01:14:17.453
They can't see
what matters.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.107
They need looking after.

01:14:20.107 --> 01:14:21.544
So what matters?

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.372
What matters is power.

01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:27.680
You can hold it
and use it.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.595
And who's using you?

01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:32.642
Well, Claire, certainly
people who don't like

01:14:32.642 --> 01:14:34.644
what you're doing.

01:14:34.644 --> 01:14:37.734
They don't give
a rat's ass
about journalists.

01:14:42.086 --> 01:14:43.261
How much further?

01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:44.436
We're almost there.

01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:46.133
It's just over the ridge.

01:14:55.795 --> 01:14:58.624
What's with
the singing, man?

01:14:58.624 --> 01:15:00.452
You noticed?

01:15:00.452 --> 01:15:04.761
Well, I believe that
when one encounters danger,

01:15:04.761 --> 01:15:06.502
you should sing to it.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.591
You care to try?

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:10.244
Not much of a singer.

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:12.246
Not much
of a dancer either.

01:15:12.246 --> 01:15:14.031
Ha ha ha!

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:15.423
You're not afraid
of a big belly laugh

01:15:15.423 --> 01:15:16.512
every now
and again, huh?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:18.209
Oh. Of course not.

01:15:18.209 --> 01:15:21.255
I believe that
one should always
remember to laugh.

01:15:22.996 --> 01:15:25.042
Well, I found out
why I'm here.

01:15:26.434 --> 01:15:28.698
Oh.

01:15:28.698 --> 01:15:31.483
They wanted me
to kill you.

01:15:31.483 --> 01:15:33.137
That makes sense.

01:15:33.137 --> 01:15:35.008
- It does?
- Of course.

01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:37.228
You blame me
for shooting down
your helicopter,

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:40.274
for your friends dying,
for your life ever since.

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:42.712
Then my late bodyguard
Manuel gives you a gun

01:15:42.712 --> 01:15:44.235
and lets you
into my bedroom.

01:15:44.235 --> 01:15:45.802
Wait. You knew
about that?

01:15:45.802 --> 01:15:47.151
I don't stay in power

01:15:47.151 --> 01:15:49.632
by not knowing
things, Mason.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:51.198
I'd be so bad
at being a dictator.

01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:52.852
No. You'd be great
at it.

01:15:52.852 --> 01:15:55.681
It's just practice.

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:59.424
There is something important
I need to tell you, though.

01:15:59.424 --> 01:16:01.644
I didn't shoot down
your helicopter.

01:16:01.644 --> 01:16:03.167
Come on, man.

01:16:03.167 --> 01:16:04.908
I know you
didn't personally.

01:16:04.908 --> 01:16:07.519
It was friendly fire.

01:16:07.519 --> 01:16:10.304
Do you really think we
can stop an American invasion

01:16:10.304 --> 01:16:12.959
by shooting down
one helicopter?

01:16:12.959 --> 01:16:15.005
I mean, of course,
I knew you guys were coming,

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:17.355
but there was
nothing I could do
to stop you,

01:16:17.355 --> 01:16:21.315
so as a matter of fact,
I was getting ready to
take a boat to Cuba,

01:16:21.315 --> 01:16:23.709
and suddenly,
a helicopter gets shot down,

01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:28.409
and everything stops
just like that,

01:16:28.409 --> 01:16:30.498
and the next morning,
I get a visit

01:16:30.498 --> 01:16:32.892
from one of my ex-patrons
telling me that

01:16:32.892 --> 01:16:36.156
the next time the helicopter
would land

01:16:36.156 --> 01:16:40.117
unless I signed off
some new oil leases,

01:16:40.117 --> 01:16:42.380
which of course I did.

01:16:45.862 --> 01:16:47.603
We were pawns.

01:16:49.648 --> 01:16:52.216
I am very sorry about
your friends, Mason.

01:16:58.091 --> 01:17:00.964
It's just crazy how all
this is going down

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:03.619
after you agree to do
your first interview
in 10 years.

01:17:05.272 --> 01:17:08.188
Ah. That's why you
needed Claire.

01:17:08.188 --> 01:17:10.190
You were gonna tell
the truth before they
could take you out

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.497
and replace
you with somebody
more user-friendly.

01:17:16.370 --> 01:17:18.111
We'll stop
here for the night,

01:17:18.111 --> 01:17:21.593
and then, then we
end the charade.

01:17:58.108 --> 01:18:00.588
Brother, you are
killing me right now.

01:18:00.588 --> 01:18:02.025
I'm worried
sick about you.

01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.591
- Are you still with Venegas?
- Yeah.

01:18:03.591 --> 01:18:05.811
I cut ties
with the South Africans.

01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:07.770
I'm gonna make
this go away.

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:12.905
Dude, we need to talk.

01:18:12.905 --> 01:18:14.428
- Gracias.
- Sí.

01:18:14.428 --> 01:18:17.170
- Gracias.
- De nada.

01:18:17.170 --> 01:18:19.172
Thanks.

01:18:19.172 --> 01:18:22.306
Mmm. Heh heh heh.

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.141
So I agreed to
trade you for Claire.

01:18:33.534 --> 01:18:35.406
Of course you did.

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:37.669
Heh. Yeah, it's a...

01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:41.020
move I haven't totally
thought through, but...

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:43.762
Hmm.

01:18:43.762 --> 01:18:45.372
May I please
use your phone?

01:18:45.372 --> 01:18:47.635
For what?

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:49.507
I am going to call
someone I trust.

01:18:49.507 --> 01:18:51.770
- Eduardo Lavato.
- Who's that?

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.294
He's an old friend

01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:58.168
and the shadow leader
of the opposition party, too.

01:18:58.168 --> 01:19:00.518
He's very resourceful.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.098
Mason, please, will you
sit down and enjoy

01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:16.795
a cup of espresso
with me?

01:19:16.795 --> 01:19:18.101
It's the best one
in Paldoñia, huh?

01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:19.885
This is a stupid idea.

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:22.845
Gracias, amor.

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:24.760
What is that saying?

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.978
Keep your friends close,

01:19:25.978 --> 01:19:27.806
keep your enemies closer.

01:19:27.806 --> 01:19:30.591
Yes it's from "The Go"--
it's from "The Godfather."

01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:34.421
America does produce
some wonderful culture,
don't you agree?

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.402
Papi. Ha ha ha!

01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:02.014
-  You're alive Papi!
- I am!

01:20:02.014 --> 01:20:03.799
It's good to see you.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:05.322
It was not my men
who attacked you.

01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:06.627
I know, I know.

01:20:06.627 --> 01:20:08.673
- Espresso?
- Naturally.

01:20:10.283 --> 01:20:11.894
Who is this?

01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:14.548
This is my new
American friend Mason Pettits,

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:16.594
and he's very
worried about you.

01:20:16.594 --> 01:20:18.509
- An American friend?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:20.206 --> 01:20:21.773
You really have
hit bottom.

01:20:21.773 --> 01:20:23.906
Ah. Sit down.
Sit down.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.824
Did you know
we went

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.435
to secondary
school together?

01:20:31.435 --> 01:20:33.698
- Jesuits.
- Jesuits.

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:35.395
And I could tell you something.

01:20:35.395 --> 01:20:37.267
They did not let us get
away with anything.

01:20:37.267 --> 01:20:40.618
Nada. Hmm? Heh heh heh.

01:20:40.618 --> 01:20:42.750
This is delicious.

01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:46.145
So do tell.

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:48.408
What can the People's
Worker Party

01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:50.541
and/or The Armed
Revolutionary Front

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:53.326
of Paldoñia do
for you today?

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.375
Just a petite favor,
my friend.

01:21:04.207 --> 01:21:08.646
So, uh, I got to ask.

01:21:08.646 --> 01:21:11.170
Why have an espresso
with a man who calls me

01:21:11.170 --> 01:21:13.085
a thief and a butcher
on a daily basis

01:21:13.085 --> 01:21:15.522
and every so often
lets off a bomb downtown?

01:21:15.522 --> 01:21:18.438
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:18.438 --> 01:21:21.050
Well, perception is
reality, my friend.

01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:23.879
I pay Lavato
and his resistance.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:26.098
Every couple of months,
I let them blow up a car,

01:21:26.098 --> 01:21:29.188
burn down a building,
staging a caravan.

01:21:29.188 --> 01:21:32.888
It's like--it's like
a steam valve, you know?

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.933
Lets off pressure.

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:37.544
Psssss.

01:21:37.544 --> 01:21:39.938
And then I crack down
on them so everybody knows

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.941
they need Venegas
to give order, huh?

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.421
Ha ha ha!

01:21:44.421 --> 01:21:45.813
My granduncle, he--

01:21:45.813 --> 01:21:47.206
Your granduncle
you overthrew?

01:21:47.206 --> 01:21:48.555
Yes, that one.
He never understood this.

01:21:48.555 --> 01:21:50.079
Took everything personally.

01:21:50.079 --> 01:21:52.385
Of course,
it backfired on him.

01:21:52.385 --> 01:21:53.821
So wait.

01:21:55.432 --> 01:21:57.521
So you--you bought
the revolution?

01:21:57.521 --> 01:21:59.915
Much simpler
and a lot of cheaper.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.525
It's like you Americans
like to say,

01:22:01.525 --> 01:22:03.222
"A win-win."

01:22:03.222 --> 01:22:06.399
You should see
Eduardo's pool. Oh!

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:47.832
Keep her there.

01:22:52.184 --> 01:22:53.794
Colonel Koehorst?

01:22:53.794 --> 01:22:55.883
Former South African SAS.

01:22:55.883 --> 01:22:57.494
Three-two Battalion.

01:22:57.494 --> 01:22:59.191
U.S. Army Special Forces?

01:22:59.191 --> 01:23:01.324
Me? I'm a lawyer.

01:23:01.324 --> 01:23:04.022
Sorry. All out
of business cards.

01:23:04.022 --> 01:23:05.502
Pretty brazen thing
you're doing here,

01:23:05.502 --> 01:23:06.894
taking over
a sovereign nation.

01:23:06.894 --> 01:23:08.505
Sovereign?

01:23:08.505 --> 01:23:10.115
When all's said and done,
no one's gonna have

01:23:10.115 --> 01:23:12.291
a problem with what
we're doing here.

01:23:12.291 --> 01:23:13.858
The people
of Paldoñia might.

01:23:13.858 --> 01:23:15.947
They won't know
the difference.

01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:17.601
Status quo, my friend.

01:23:20.778 --> 01:23:23.346
You should have done
what was expected,
Sergeant Pettits.

01:23:23.346 --> 01:23:26.349
Nah. I would have
never gotten near him.

01:23:26.349 --> 01:23:28.307
You see, Venegas knew
it was going down.

01:23:28.307 --> 01:23:29.787
You'd be surprised
what that guy
knows actually.

01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:32.268
Sharp dude,
great dresser.

01:23:32.268 --> 01:23:34.096
Are we doing this then?

01:23:36.402 --> 01:23:38.143
Let's do it.

01:23:41.929 --> 01:23:44.454
Bring
the princess out of the car.

01:23:53.767 --> 01:23:55.595
Unh!

01:23:55.595 --> 01:23:57.119
Time for you
to hand over Venegas

01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:59.773
and piss off
out of the country.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:01.819
If you don't do that
in 5 seconds,

01:24:01.819 --> 01:24:05.083
I'm going to kill
your client in front of you.

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:06.302
1...

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:08.608
2, 3, 4--

01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:11.959
OK. OK.

01:24:11.959 --> 01:24:13.396
OK!

01:24:52.652 --> 01:24:54.045
Unh!

01:24:59.442 --> 01:25:01.313
Move!

01:25:03.837 --> 01:25:07.363
Go, go, go! Aah!

01:25:07.363 --> 01:25:09.234
Get back!

01:25:25.729 --> 01:25:27.644
What was that?

01:25:27.644 --> 01:25:30.734
That was my people,
Claire, huh?

01:25:30.734 --> 01:25:33.258
Now I give my people
a message,

01:25:33.258 --> 01:25:35.130
and you share it
with the world.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:36.827
Great. Let's get started.

01:25:36.827 --> 01:25:38.089
I--I can live feed it
through Infamous Daily.

01:25:38.089 --> 01:25:39.873
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:25:39.873 --> 01:25:41.440
I cannot deliver such
an important message from here.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:42.746
We have to do it
from my palace

01:25:42.746 --> 01:25:44.226
with my nephew
by my side.

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:45.749
Come on. What, do we
just go up

01:25:45.749 --> 01:25:48.578
and knock
on the front door? No.

01:25:48.578 --> 01:25:50.362
There is another way.

01:25:52.016 --> 01:25:56.063
Oh. Watch your
head there, OK?

01:25:56.063 --> 01:25:57.674
This is the tunnel
I used to escape

01:25:57.674 --> 01:25:59.458
when they tried to
kill me 8 years ago.

01:25:59.458 --> 01:26:01.199
Are you sure this tunnel
isn't guarded?

01:26:01.199 --> 01:26:02.896
Absolutely!

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:04.985
All the people who know
about it are dead now.

01:26:04.985 --> 01:26:06.639
What about the other
times they tried
to kill you?

01:26:06.639 --> 01:26:09.512
Oh, that's different
dead people.

01:26:09.512 --> 01:26:11.166
Let's go.

01:26:35.973 --> 01:26:37.583
- Hey.
- Aah! Ohh!

01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:39.150
Uncle!

01:26:39.150 --> 01:26:40.195
No, no.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.196
OK. Hey, hey, hey.
Thank you.

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.327
No, thank you.

01:26:42.327 --> 01:26:44.199
I am not here to hurt you.

01:26:44.764 --> 01:26:46.418
It's OK.

01:26:46.418 --> 01:26:48.942
These are
my American friends.

01:26:48.942 --> 01:26:50.901
They are here to help.

01:26:50.901 --> 01:26:52.946
What is this
woman doing?

01:26:52.946 --> 01:26:55.340
I'm live streaming this
to the entire world.

01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.560
Listen to me.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.736
when you are no longer
useful to them,

01:26:59.736 --> 01:27:01.825
they are going to
kill you.

01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:03.653
Paldoñia deserves
a better future,

01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:06.917
not one controlled
by corporations.

01:27:06.917 --> 01:27:11.617
We--we don't have
to be monsters anymore.

01:27:17.449 --> 01:27:22.715
Yes. Yes.

01:27:24.761 --> 01:27:27.285
You've always
been my favorite.

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.681
General Martínez.

01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:34.161
Mr. President.

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:36.120
Alive and kicking!

01:27:37.556 --> 01:27:39.123
So I see.

01:27:43.127 --> 01:27:44.824
Ohh!

01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:46.652
Aah! Aah!

01:27:51.657 --> 01:27:53.137
You good?

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:54.747
Yeah.

01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:03.756
Yeah. I'm OK.
I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:28:03.756 --> 01:28:05.497
Look. Look.

01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:09.327
Ahh. Heh. Ha ha!

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.764
Bulletproof suit
from Medici.

01:28:11.764 --> 01:28:13.200
Ha ha ha! Huh?

01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:15.159
I should have one
made for you.

01:28:16.508 --> 01:28:18.771
Jorge. Jorge.

01:28:20.382 --> 01:28:22.035
Jorge. Jorge.

01:28:22.035 --> 01:28:23.472
You're okay! You're okay!

01:28:23.472 --> 01:28:24.821
You're okay!

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:31.218
Uncle...

01:28:31.958 --> 01:28:32.872
Shh.

01:28:33.133 --> 01:28:34.309
Uncle...

01:28:35.658 --> 01:28:37.703
They killed... me.

01:28:38.356 --> 01:28:40.880
Shh. Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:43.492
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:20.659
Surrender!

01:29:22.226 --> 01:29:24.010
Soldiers!

01:29:24.010 --> 01:29:27.144
I know you are obeying orders.

01:29:27.927 --> 01:29:29.451
My children...

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:32.454
You don't have to do this.

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:35.544
My brothers.

01:29:35.544 --> 01:29:39.330
You can change the destiny
of this country.

01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.506
Not for me.

01:29:41.506 --> 01:29:43.595
But for you.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.556
For your mothers.

01:29:47.556 --> 01:29:49.427
For your fathers.

01:29:50.994 --> 01:29:53.344
For your children.

01:29:53.344 --> 01:29:56.347
This country has bled
for too long.

01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:58.915
This madness has to end.

01:30:05.008 --> 01:30:06.270
Oh, shit.

01:30:06.270 --> 01:30:08.315
Now is the time
to fight...

01:30:08.315 --> 01:30:12.145
Fight... for this land.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:18.021
My brothers.

01:30:18.021 --> 01:30:19.326
Defend

01:30:19.326 --> 01:30:21.154
your homeland.

01:30:25.202 --> 01:30:27.030
Go!

01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:42.524
Take cover!

01:30:45.178 --> 01:30:46.876
Suppressing fire!

01:30:51.010 --> 01:30:53.099
Go! Go for Paldoñia!

01:30:53.099 --> 01:30:55.711
Hey! Not the time
for coaching.

01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:57.321
- Fuck, man!
- Oh!

01:31:06.069 --> 01:31:08.114
Spielberg, what
the hell are you doing?

01:31:08.114 --> 01:31:09.289
- What?
- Stay down!

01:31:09.289 --> 01:31:10.769
Fine!

01:31:14.599 --> 01:31:17.123
Take the tunnel, OK?
Hold on. Hold on.

01:31:17.123 --> 01:31:21.258
Ready? Go, go, go,
go, go!

01:31:28.265 --> 01:31:29.440
Follow me!
Follow me!

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:31.181
Mason?

01:31:33.444 --> 01:31:35.533
Go, go!

01:31:35.533 --> 01:31:38.362
- You've been hit.
- I'm fine! Go!

01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:42.497
Aah!

01:31:45.543 --> 01:31:47.893
See? I'm fine.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.333
Come in.
We're safe here.

01:31:53.333 --> 01:31:55.727
This is my man cave.

01:31:55.727 --> 01:31:58.338
Oh. You care
for a drink?

01:31:58.338 --> 01:32:00.123
Yeah. I always
love a single malt

01:32:00.123 --> 01:32:02.604
after I kneecap
a few mercenaries.

01:32:06.172 --> 01:32:08.479
Come on, Mason.
Embrace the suck.

01:32:08.479 --> 01:32:09.872
Nnn, nnn, nnn.

01:32:12.265 --> 01:32:13.789
Uh-oh.

01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:33.809
Hmm. Ah! Yes.

01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:36.376
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

01:32:42.557 --> 01:32:44.210
This way. Come on.

01:32:49.302 --> 01:32:51.043
Mr. Venegas?

01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:55.657
Mr. President?

01:32:56.179 --> 01:32:57.572
Yes...

01:32:58.442 --> 01:32:59.574
Go!
Aah!

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.706
Go, go, go!

01:33:01.706 --> 01:33:03.882
Go, go, go!

01:33:09.627 --> 01:33:12.717
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:33:17.983 --> 01:33:19.245
That way. That way.

01:33:19.245 --> 01:33:21.421
We have to go
that way.

01:33:21.421 --> 01:33:22.553
Aah!

01:33:31.693 --> 01:33:33.346
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:13.996
Agh!

01:34:20.132 --> 01:34:22.482
- Get down.
- OK.

01:34:29.054 --> 01:34:30.447
Aah!

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:04.524
- Let's go! Let's go!
- OK.

01:35:04.524 --> 01:35:06.135
Ready? Aah!

01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:27.243
Errgh!

01:35:30.028 --> 01:35:32.727
Say hello
to your mates for me.

01:35:32.727 --> 01:35:35.425
Shame it took so long
to finish the job.

01:35:35.425 --> 01:35:38.689
You--you killed
my friends.

01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:40.517
There were 7 of us.

01:35:40.517 --> 01:35:43.085
RPGs aren't
that easy to aim.

01:35:43.085 --> 01:35:45.652
It's just a job,
my friend.

01:35:51.267 --> 01:35:52.572
Unh!

01:35:54.705 --> 01:35:56.228
Hey.

01:35:56.228 --> 01:35:57.490
Where'd you learn that?

01:35:57.490 --> 01:35:58.796
The throat thing?

01:35:58.796 --> 01:36:00.798
Thank my dad
for that.

01:36:00.798 --> 01:36:02.495
I told you
I could help.

01:36:04.933 --> 01:36:06.586
Let's go.

01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:19.599
Mason! I could
really use your
help right now.

01:36:22.515 --> 01:36:23.778
Shit!

01:36:28.565 --> 01:36:30.219
- Shit!
- Oh, my God.

01:36:48.019 --> 01:36:49.804
Aah! Aah!

01:36:58.464 --> 01:36:59.814
What?

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:01.032
- Oh, oh.
- Nothing.

01:37:01.032 --> 01:37:02.512
- Keep shooting them.
- OK.

01:37:13.697 --> 01:37:16.874
- Come on!
- Let's go!

01:37:16.874 --> 01:37:18.180
On me!

01:37:20.095 --> 01:37:21.792
Down the hall!

01:37:21.792 --> 01:37:23.489
Hey, bro!

01:37:23.489 --> 01:37:25.535
Ha ha! Chicks Dig It!

01:37:25.535 --> 01:37:27.015
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:37:27.015 --> 01:37:28.930
It's an inside joke.

01:37:30.322 --> 01:37:32.020
Go! Go! Go!

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.543
Different man:
Take cover!

01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:36.285
Come on!

01:37:38.417 --> 01:37:39.723
- Yes!
- Unh!

01:37:39.723 --> 01:37:40.811
Sorry I'm late, brother.

01:37:40.811 --> 01:37:42.291
You kidding me?

01:37:46.121 --> 01:37:47.600
Never thought
I'd say this,

01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.472
but I'd like
to introduce you

01:37:49.472 --> 01:37:52.388
to President Venegas.

01:37:52.388 --> 01:37:54.564
Welcome to Paldoñia.

01:37:54.564 --> 01:37:56.044
Nice to meet you...

01:37:56.044 --> 01:37:57.654
I think.

01:38:01.832 --> 01:38:03.225
Oh!

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:07.316
Retreat!

01:38:12.495 --> 01:38:15.411
The eyes of the world
are still fixed on Paldoñia,

01:38:15.411 --> 01:38:18.414
where the fallout from a failed
coup continues to play out.

01:38:18.414 --> 01:38:20.807
In a bold act
of guerrilla journalism,

01:38:20.807 --> 01:38:23.549
using a live stream through
gossip site Infamous Daily,

01:38:23.549 --> 01:38:26.161
celebrity reporter
Claire Wellington provided

01:38:26.161 --> 01:38:29.512
on-the-ground coverage
of these shocking events.

01:38:29.512 --> 01:38:32.515
The Paldoñian military were seen
in an intense gun battle

01:38:32.515 --> 01:38:34.299
with members of what
we now know to be

01:38:34.299 --> 01:38:36.301
a private military company.

01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:38.434
Ms. Wellington has also uploaded

01:38:38.434 --> 01:38:41.741
an exclusive uncut interview
with President Venegas,

01:38:41.741 --> 01:38:43.613
announcing a surprising reversal

01:38:43.613 --> 01:38:46.790
in the Paldoñian system
of government.

01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:51.186
I know
as a journalist

01:38:51.186 --> 01:38:52.970
I'm supposed to stay
objective and all,

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:56.147
but I have to say I really
admire what you're doing.

01:38:56.147 --> 01:38:57.975
Well, you know
what they say.

01:38:57.975 --> 01:39:01.283
The man who touches honey
will eventually...

01:39:02.762 --> 01:39:04.373
lick his fingers.

01:39:04.373 --> 01:39:06.897
Oh. Hmm.

01:39:06.897 --> 01:39:08.943
Ha ha!

01:39:08.943 --> 01:39:11.293
I really appreciate
you two.

01:39:11.293 --> 01:39:14.035
I really do.

01:39:14.035 --> 01:39:18.343
And look. The world
is finally seeing us,

01:39:18.343 --> 01:39:21.433
and it is all because
of you, Miss Wellington.

01:39:21.433 --> 01:39:23.522
Looks like your
tattoo was right.

01:39:23.522 --> 01:39:25.524
Everything
worked out just fine.

01:39:25.524 --> 01:39:28.092
Worked out fine,
thanks to you.

01:39:28.092 --> 01:39:29.615
- Team effort.
- Yes!

01:39:29.615 --> 01:39:31.052
The right people
at the right time.

01:39:31.052 --> 01:39:33.228
Yeah.

01:39:33.228 --> 01:39:34.881
Let's go tell
a story to the world.

01:39:34.881 --> 01:39:36.361
I will follow
your lead.

01:39:36.361 --> 01:39:39.799
Hold up just one second
just so I know.

01:39:39.799 --> 01:39:42.106
How many people in this room
want to kill you right now?

01:39:42.106 --> 01:39:43.760
Eh, probably half.

01:39:45.805 --> 01:39:48.852
No, more than half.
Ha ha ha!

01:39:48.852 --> 01:39:51.289
Ah. Let's go.
Come on.

01:39:51.289 --> 01:39:53.378
Uh...

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:00.037
Welcome.

01:40:00.037 --> 01:40:05.173
As of today, I am no longer
the president of Paldoñia.

01:40:05.173 --> 01:40:07.827
A transitional government
has been put in place

01:40:07.827 --> 01:40:09.394
until the next free elections.

01:40:09.394 --> 01:40:13.355
During this transitional period,
$5 billion will be invested

01:40:13.355 --> 01:40:16.619
in health, education,
and infrastructure.

01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:19.752
This is an investment
in the people of Paldoñia.

01:40:19.752 --> 01:40:24.235
Today, you get back
what is rightfully yours,

01:40:24.235 --> 01:40:27.499
and for the years to come,
we'll protect

01:40:27.499 --> 01:40:32.156
and control these resources
with the sole purpose...

01:40:32.156 --> 01:40:33.505
Mason.

01:40:33.505 --> 01:40:35.464
of giving
this beautiful nation...

01:40:35.464 --> 01:40:39.076
Like, uh, dancing when
he's, like, not fluent.

01:40:39.076 --> 01:40:42.384
He's literally...

01:40:42.384 --> 01:40:45.604
That's only because
you know...

01:40:49.086 --> 01:40:52.350
Anyway, I want
to teach...

01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:53.482
Daddy!

01:40:53.482 --> 01:40:56.137
Hey, Worm. Ha ha ha!

01:40:56.137 --> 01:40:58.965
Aww! Ahh!

01:40:58.965 --> 01:41:01.577
And check this out.

01:41:02.839 --> 01:41:04.536
Boom.

01:41:06.930 --> 01:41:09.106
What happened
to your face?

01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:11.021
It's a long story.

01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:13.241
- Oh, baby.
- Here I am.

01:41:16.592 --> 01:41:18.942
In one piece.

01:41:19.943 --> 01:41:23.077
Just so you know,
that broken man

01:41:23.077 --> 01:41:24.382
you wanted a divorce,
he disappeared somewhere

01:41:24.382 --> 01:41:26.036
in South America.

01:41:26.036 --> 01:41:27.472
Ha ha ha!

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:30.867
I was really hoping
you'd reconsider.

01:41:30.867 --> 01:41:33.913
Ah, you know what?

01:41:33.913 --> 01:41:36.438
I think I'm gonna have
to consult my lawyer.

01:41:40.442 --> 01:41:42.096
Oh, Mason.

01:42:02.116 --> 01:42:05.467
I'm just gonna make
a... quick stop.

01:42:16.304 --> 01:42:17.827
Shit.

01:42:34.713 --> 01:42:36.802
- Yes!
- What? Huh?

01:42:36.802 --> 01:42:38.935
Mason, voice-over:
And just like that,

01:42:38.935 --> 01:42:41.503
I saw an incredible life
of minivans,

01:42:41.503 --> 01:42:43.896
playdates, and amusement parks,

01:42:43.896 --> 01:42:47.335
and for the first time in my
entire overachieving life...

01:42:47.335 --> 01:42:48.945
- No!
- That dance.

01:42:48.945 --> 01:42:50.381
Mason, voice-over: I was happy.

01:42:52.557 --> 01:42:55.604
What's up?

01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:57.214
What do you say
we just take the rest

01:42:57.214 --> 01:42:58.955
of the day off
and spend it
with the family?

01:42:58.955 --> 01:43:00.739
- Yeah!
- Yeah, you like that?

01:43:00.739 --> 01:43:01.827
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

01:43:01.827 --> 01:43:02.915
You're so cute. Why?

01:43:02.915 --> 01:43:04.961
Uh, well, um...

01:43:04.961 --> 01:43:06.441
Mason, voice-over:
I had purpose.

01:43:18.670 --> 01:43:20.281
He says he doesn't
know that I know.

01:43:20.281 --> 01:43:21.673
I think he does know.

01:43:21.673 --> 01:43:23.066
He was there,
and then we came out,

01:43:23.066 --> 01:43:24.676
and he was, like,
just dick staring,

01:43:24.676 --> 01:43:26.243
and it was, like, weird
because, you know, like,

01:43:26.243 --> 01:43:27.636
you only have
2 seconds, 5--5 tops...

01:43:27.636 --> 01:43:29.812
Well, because it's--
it's impressive.

01:43:29.812 --> 01:43:31.292
to stare
at a guy's dick.

01:43:31.292 --> 01:43:33.250
You look at that, it is
like a beast of its own.

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.730
He--it was, like--
I'm telling you it was...

01:43:34.730 --> 01:43:35.905
It's a snake.
It's a monster.

01:43:35.905 --> 01:43:37.515
8 Mississippi.

01:43:37.515 --> 01:43:40.344
Yeah, it's--yeah.
All right. What else?

01:43:40.344 --> 01:43:42.259
Are you a serious
journalist for sure?

01:43:42.259 --> 01:43:43.913
I am for sure
a serious journalist,

01:43:43.913 --> 01:43:45.915
and I would like you to
take me seriously.

01:43:45.915 --> 01:43:47.699
I don't understand why...

01:43:47.699 --> 01:43:49.484
I think--I think
I can do that after
what just happened.

01:43:49.484 --> 01:43:51.268
- you're not.
- No, that's fair.

01:43:51.268 --> 01:43:52.965
Yeah.

01:44:03.324 --> 01:44:05.239
2-5 seconds max, dude.

01:44:05.239 --> 01:44:06.588
I am still
very sorry.

01:44:06.588 --> 01:44:08.329
I didn't know you felt
this way, but we can--

01:44:08.329 --> 01:44:10.156
Those are--those
are unwritten rules

01:44:10.156 --> 01:44:12.028
on the walls
of every YMCA.

01:44:12.028 --> 01:44:13.769
There are rooms up there,
We can--we can take this--

01:44:13.769 --> 01:44:15.771
Every fucking YMCA
has something

01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:18.339
in the bathroom about
5 seconds dick staring max.

01:44:18.339 --> 01:44:19.470
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

01:44:19.470 --> 01:44:20.950
Welcome to America.
