Peter, I just hit a pothole
in the road and got a flat.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.207
The man who helped us gave her his card.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.542
I'd keep an eye on that.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.586
This town is falling apart.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.464
Last week the bridge over
the collapsed bridge collapsed.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.382
Well, you're a middle-aged woman
with no job.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.301
Maybe you should
get really worked up about it.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.636
You know what? I think I will.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.722
I'm going down to city hall to complain.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.599
This town needs a mayor.

00:59.684 --> 01:02.979
Y-You forgot your baby. Miss?

01:08.193 --> 01:10.362
Thank you all for coming over
to help us find

01:10.445 --> 01:12.322
the best candidate for mayor.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.699
This room is so diverse, so I'm assuming

01:14.783 --> 01:17.285
many of you have agendas.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.747
But let's keep in mind we need
a mayor who will represent

01:20.830 --> 01:23.583
all of Quahog and not just satisfy

01:23.667 --> 01:25.585
your weird little fringe issues,

01:25.669 --> 01:28.213
which are important,
but not very important.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.465
As a descendent
of Quahog's Puritan forefathers,

01:30.548 --> 01:32.592
I think we should be able
to throw a woman into a pond

01:32.676 --> 01:34.094
to see if she's a witch.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.429
That seems a bit extreme, don't you think?

01:36.513 --> 01:40.141
That's exactly what a witch would say.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.976
Lois, you're making this harder
than it needs to be.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.937
Just get a former Batman and move on.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.147
I'm sure Val Kilmer
could use the insurance.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.650
Peter, we're not going
to get a former Batman.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.027
That has been pitched
every day since Adam West died

01:51.111 --> 01:53.279
and the response has been tepid at best.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.490
We need someone with fresh ideas.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.283
Someone who knows the issues.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.662
Well, if you're looking
for someone with issues,

02:00.745 --> 02:02.872
I think you've found your candidate.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.417

02:05.500 --> 02:07.043
(Stewie laughs)

02:07.127 --> 02:09.254
I had to go to bed early
because it's a grown-up party,

02:09.337 --> 02:10.839
but Mom said if I was quiet,

02:10.922 --> 02:12.841
I could listen from the top of the stairs.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.719
You know, I think you might be
a really good candidate.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.762
You know the town, you're smart

02:17.846 --> 02:20.181
and you clearly have nothing better to do.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.309
So all in favor of the librarian
running for mayor say aye.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.353
-ALL: Aye.
-What about ALF?

02:25.437 --> 02:27.564

No relation.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.114
Elle Hitler? Eh.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.283
Let's all say hi to Elle Hitler.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.870
-Hi, Elle Hitler.
Yay!

02:45.290 --> 02:47.751
I can't believe Lois wants
the librarian to be mayor.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.127
I mean, Mayor West was a legend,

02:49.210 --> 02:50.462
and now they're gonna replace him

02:50.545 --> 02:52.589
with some third-tier character
with a joke name?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.550
-That's Chinatown, Peter.
-What?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.553
I said, "That's Chinatown."
It's from the movie Chinatown.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.681
It means, like, "What are you gonna do?
That's Chinatown."

03:01.765 --> 03:03.350
Joe, did you finally get Netflix?

03:03.433 --> 03:05.602
I did.
And I just watched Chinatown.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.228
It's kind of gross.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.898
Quahog deserves a cool mayor,
like Mayor West was.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.900
But there's no one cooler than Adam West.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.569
If only he had had a offspring.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.864
Speaking of offspring,
Faye Dunaway slept with her dad

03:17.947 --> 03:20.992
in Chinatown and then had his baby.

Mayor West didn't have any kids,

03:26.873 --> 03:31.044
but he did have a cousin, Wild West.

03:31.127 --> 03:32.712

I just don't think it's fair
for you to breeze into town

11:28.313 --> 11:31.107
with your rugged good looks
and voice of the gods

11:31.191 --> 11:32.901
and assume you should be mayor.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.236
Especially when you're
taking an opportunity away

11:35.320 --> 11:37.155
from a very deserving woman.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.157
That's a fair point, Lois.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.243
Do you mind if I make you
a sweater while I respond?

11:42.327 --> 11:44.662
(exhales)
Uh, no.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.539
No, that would be fine.

11:46.623 --> 11:50.543
Lois, I moved my whole family
to Oregon when I was 13,

11:50.627 --> 11:53.254
and it taught me
that a town is like a horse.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.673
You don't choose it.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.424
-(bleats)
-It chooses you.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.760
And I believe Quahog has chosen me,

11:58.843 --> 12:00.804
just like it chose my cousin Adam.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.683
Now, the last thing I want to do
is take something from a woman.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.394
There's nothing I respect more than women.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.729
(giggles)
Is that so?

12:09.813 --> 12:11.731
Yes'm.
I've raised 16 daughters

12:11.815 --> 12:14.442
into strong, independent women,

12:14.526 --> 12:16.611
I'm a registered doula,

12:16.695 --> 12:20.031
and I always order edamame for the table.

12:20.115 --> 12:23.535
(sighing):
Oh, my God. Oh. Huh.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.037
So, y-you're all alone... up here?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.747
With no one to...

12:27.831 --> 12:30.291
touch your sweaty biceps?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.584
Huh?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.628
A man's never alone, Lois,

12:33.712 --> 12:36.131
so long as he has his principles.

12:37.132 --> 12:40.010
(shuddering):
H-H-Holy thundering Lord.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.013
Lois, can we keep it?
I'll take care of it, I promise.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.431
-(chomps)
-Aah!

12:44.514 --> 12:45.890
Ow! He bit me!

12:45.974 --> 12:47.434
I don't like it now.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.518
(squealing)

12:53.064 --> 12:56.901
Peter, do you wanna maybe
do some role-playing?

12:56.985 --> 12:59.029
Okay.
I'll be Quentin Tarantino,

12:59.112 --> 13:01.072
and you be the foot I make a mess on.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.033
No, actually, I-I was thinking

13:03.116 --> 13:05.785
that maybe you could
pretend to be a cowboy.

13:05.869 --> 13:07.662
Okay.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.955
(sighs):
Oh, Lois...

13:09.039 --> 13:10.790
LOIS:
Uh, make your voice deeper.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.792
-PETER (deeper): Oh, Lois...
-Deeper!

13:12.876 --> 13:14.627
PETER (very deep):
Oh, Lois.

13:14.711 --> 13:15.712
LOIS:
Good.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.466
Now say, "Beef: it's what's for dinner."

13:19.549 --> 13:21.426
-PETER: I-I don't...
-Say it!
-(loud slap)

13:21.509 --> 13:23.053
-PETER (very deep): Beef...
-Oh, yes.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.055
-it's what's for dinner.
-(laughs): Oh, yes!

13:25.138 --> 13:27.474
Oh, Wild West, Wild West.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.641
PETER:
What?!

13:28.725 --> 13:30.643
Peter, what the hell are you wearing?

13:30.727 --> 13:33.229
I went a different direction, cowboy-wise,

13:33.313 --> 13:34.814
but don't change the subject!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.279
(paint can rattles)

13:42.906 --> 13:45.450
-Peter, what are you doing?
-I've decided that Wild West

13:45.533 --> 13:47.744
is the worst possible person to be mayor,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.080
and I'm gonna do
whatever I can to stop him.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.916
O-Okay, is this because
I called out his name twice during sex

13:52.999 --> 13:55.168
and once while I was peeing after?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.588
-That's part of it, yes.
-I'm sorry, Peter, it just slipped out.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.341
Well, I'm sorry I'm the length
of a Mike and Ike!

14:01.424 --> 14:03.301
In your dreams.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.012
(takes deep breath)

14:06.096 --> 14:07.639
That one stung, Lois.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.848
(takes deep breath)

14:08.932 --> 14:11.101
Ooh, that one stung.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.689
All right, I'm on your side now.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.232
And if you're gonna beat Wild West,

14:17.315 --> 14:19.567
you have to recognize that
one of his greatest strengths

14:19.651 --> 14:22.779
is his voice, which makes him
sound sexy and smart

14:22.862 --> 14:24.614
and sexy and sexy.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.075
Where your voice sounds
like your dad's second wife

14:27.158 --> 14:29.911
trying to describe
something she saw on Facebook.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.037
Oh, speaking of,

14:31.121 --> 14:34.332
do you know what a meme is?

14:34.416 --> 14:35.959
What...
Course I do.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.585
And it's pronounced "me-me."

14:37.669 --> 14:40.338
Well, the other day, I saw one

14:40.422 --> 14:42.215
with the most adorable kitten

14:42.298 --> 14:44.342
tangled in a ball of yarn.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.678
(laughing)

14:46.761 --> 14:48.930
And underneath...

14:49.014 --> 14:51.808
underneath, it said:
"(bleep) the police."

14:51.891 --> 14:53.518
(laughing)

14:53.601 --> 14:55.687
Okay, that was unexpected,
so I'm gonna ignore it

14:55.770 --> 14:57.689
and bring in Morgan Freeman,
who I've hired

14:57.772 --> 14:59.315
to narrate your commercials.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.735
We're gonna fight voice with voice.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.487
Wild West claims to know
what's best for Quahog,

15:04.571 --> 15:06.322
but there's a better choice.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.949
And I know about choice.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.118
I chose to be in Ted 2.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.453
Nobody made me.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.455
I wasn't forced at gunpoint.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.958
I relied on my advisors,
and they let me down.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.793
"They'll fix the script," they said.

15:18.877 --> 15:20.295
Well, they were wrong.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.672
I thought I'd get to act
with a talking teddy bear,

15:22.756 --> 15:24.257
but when I got there,

15:24.341 --> 15:27.260
it was just two ping-pong balls
on a stick.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.721
Or maybe that was Amanda Seyfried.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.514
I don't know.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.642
Okay, thank-thank you.
Thank you, Morgan. Thank you.

15:34.726 --> 15:37.103
Peter, just let me speak to the voters

15:37.187 --> 15:39.773
about the issues they're concerned about.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.775
Or, instead of doing that stupid thing,

15:41.858 --> 15:44.152
we could sabotage Wild West's campaign.

15:44.235 --> 15:45.820
Come on, you can drive.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.827
Big Garfield fan, huh?

15:52.911 --> 15:54.037
Me, too.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.997
-Not this big.
-You know, a lot of people

15:56.081 --> 15:59.876
think I'm obsessed,
but I think I'm pretty nermal.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.711
(laughing)

16:01.795 --> 16:04.172
Okay, you reeled me back in.

16:20.397 --> 16:24.150
(quietly):
Let's see how popular you are
when I cut off your mustache.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.005
(grunts)

16:45.088 --> 16:48.008
How is this so strong?

16:48.091 --> 16:52.345
My hair follicles run deeper
than the roots of a sequoia.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.180
Git him, fella.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.765
Oh! Aah!

16:55.849 --> 16:56.850
(grunts)

16:58.560 --> 17:00.145
Aah!

17:00.228 --> 17:01.438
Nice work.

Thanks, boss.

Quahog's new mayor is Wild West.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.524
(cheering)

18:27.607 --> 18:29.859
With a final vote of 43 to 19,

18:29.943 --> 18:32.112
it's clear that no one really cared.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.863
Nice job, guys.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.990
Peter, can I talk to you?

18:36.074 --> 18:39.285
-What?
-Look, I know we've had our differences,

18:39.369 --> 18:42.414
but I'm hoping that someday
we can bury the hatchet,

18:42.497 --> 18:44.165
maybe even be friends.

Until then, I want you
