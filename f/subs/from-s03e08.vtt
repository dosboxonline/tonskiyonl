-[screaming]
-What's wrong with her?!

00:21.731 --> 00:23.899
-What happened to you?
-What do you mean?

00:23.983 --> 00:26.193
Since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

00:26.277 --> 00:27.945
you've been different.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.282
Do you feel that?

00:31.365 --> 00:33.200
We should go.

00:33.284 --> 00:34.493
You feel it.

00:34.577 --> 00:35.745
You do.

00:35.828 --> 00:37.455
What the hell's going on?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.331
It was my idea.
She needed to come out here.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.375
Mom saw this place
when she was little.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.253
There might be a part of you
that wants so badly

00:44.336 --> 00:46.130
for all of this to make sense.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.382
This wasn't just
a random nightmare, Jim.

00:48.466 --> 00:51.177
This was a dream
I had for months.

00:51.260 --> 00:53.304
Miranda said she was chosen.

00:53.387 --> 00:55.639
If you were destined
to come to this place,

00:55.723 --> 00:57.099
then one way or another,

00:57.183 --> 00:58.517
you were always gonna come
to that tree in the road.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.189
He knows things.

01:03.272 --> 01:07.151
I heard him tell Christopher
a story about this place once.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.986
We'll make him tell it again.

01:10.696 --> 01:12.907
Can I go
in your basement?

01:12.990 --> 01:15.284
I need him
to tell me a secret.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.579
Help me, Elgin.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.873
I can save all of you.

[ominous music playing]

01:30.549 --> 01:32.051
Is this really where it happens?

01:32.134 --> 01:35.387
Whatever is inside me,
it's getting stronger.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.598
The cravings--
they're getting stronger.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.100
-I'm angry all the time.
-It's okay.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.144
-Aah!
-Fatima, it's gonna be okay.

01:42.228 --> 01:43.437
-I said go!

01:45.021 --> 01:45.940

Come on.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.327

02:05.543 --> 02:08.378
Have a seat.
Tell me what happened.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.631
We were in the--
the greenhouse.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.633
I was...

02:12.716 --> 02:15.678
And--and I didn't wanna eat
those rotting things anymore.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.055
[cries] Tillie came in,

02:18.138 --> 02:20.891
and she was trying
to help me,

02:20.975 --> 02:25.187
and I felt this wave of--
of anger come over me,

02:25.271 --> 02:26.730
like this rage.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.649
It was like this thing...

02:28.732 --> 02:31.652
inside me. It was...

02:31.735 --> 02:34.989
It was like I was there,
but I wasn't.

02:35.072 --> 02:39.410
And--and I felt my hand
reach for the shears.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.997
And I couldn't stop.

02:43.079 --> 02:44.915
[breathing shakily]
I didn't wanna do it.

02:44.999 --> 02:47.626
-There was nothing I could do.
-Here's what we're gonna do.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.546
You're gonna
stay out here tonight.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.339
And come morning,

02:52.423 --> 02:55.801
Ellis and I are gonna
figure out the best way...

02:55.885 --> 02:59.305
We're gonna figure out
how we move forward.

02:59.388 --> 03:00.806
There's no way forward.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.433
Hey. Look at me.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.853
You are my family.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.938
And what happened
back there,

03:08.022 --> 03:10.399
we are gonna
find a way to deal with it.

03:10.482 --> 03:11.692
Okay?

03:11.775 --> 03:13.110
Fatima.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.071
Okay?

03:16.155 --> 03:17.448
Okay.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.199
Okay.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.789
If you need to eat...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.208
No, no, no, no. Please...
Please take that away.

03:28.292 --> 03:29.793
Look, whatever
is happening to you...

03:29.877 --> 03:30.878
Take it away!

03:30.961 --> 03:32.338
...I don't want it
to get any worse.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.298
So, you need to eat,
you eat.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.507
What about Tillie?

03:35.591 --> 03:37.718
We just...
I left her there.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.470
-I left her there.
-[Boyd] Okay.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.222
-My God, I left her there.
-Listen to me, listen.

03:42.305 --> 03:45.059
We're gonna have to
let someone find her.

03:45.142 --> 03:47.311
Oh, my God. [crying]

03:47.394 --> 03:50.481
No. No, no, no. I know. Hey.
Look at me, look at me.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.566
Look, I need you to be strong
right now, okay?

03:52.650 --> 03:55.861
I need you to be--
Ellis needs you to be strong.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.617
That's right.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.327
Okay.

Now it's getting dark.

so far.

use gardening shears?

No.

have to talk to Sara.

who's gonna be asking about her.

she did it, fine.

go talk to her
and make sure.

those things, that's one thing.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.904
that people are gonna
have to blame someone for.

And if we don't
figure out who,

13:43.573 --> 13:46.326
then it's gonna be Sara,
whether she did it or not.

13:47.953 --> 13:49.704
Okay.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.915
You get things
straightened out here,

13:51.998 --> 13:55.085
then meet me at the station, and
we will talk to her together.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.234
[Sara] "Hello, Victor.

14:19.317 --> 14:21.528
Do you want to play today?
I can tell you a secret."

14:21.611 --> 14:24.656
No, no, not--not like that!
I just--I told you!

14:24.739 --> 14:26.032
It doesn't
sound like that, Sara!

14:26.116 --> 14:27.617
I'm doing the best
that I can!

14:27.701 --> 14:29.327
I'm trying
everything that I know!

14:29.411 --> 14:31.288
I don't know
what you want, Victor!

14:31.371 --> 14:32.956
-[mumbling]
-[thudding]

14:33.039 --> 14:34.332
-Hey, hey, hey!
-[Victor] No!

14:34.415 --> 14:36.585
No! He d--
he doesn't--you need--

14:36.668 --> 14:38.545
he needs to talk,
and you're not doing it right!

14:38.628 --> 14:40.005
I'm doing the best that I can!

14:40.088 --> 14:41.631
No, you're not
doing it good enough!

14:41.715 --> 14:43.842
No, you're not good enough.
You're not good enough!

14:43.925 --> 14:46.261
-Victor! Hey!
-You're not good enough!

14:46.344 --> 14:47.971
-Hey, don't! Stop! Stop!
-You're not good enough!

14:48.054 --> 14:49.014
-You're not good enough!
-Stop! Stop!

14:54.519 --> 14:58.231
Look, I know you want
all this to mean something,

14:58.315 --> 15:00.442
and this place has you
convinced that you need

15:00.525 --> 15:02.068
to save these children.

15:03.778 --> 15:06.031
It's got you trying to fix
something that we can never...

15:06.114 --> 15:06.823
[sighs]

15:12.912 --> 15:15.248
Do you know why
the phone is off the wall?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.919
Because it rang the other day,

15:20.003 --> 15:23.048
and the voice on the other end
said his name was Thomas.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.263
What?

15:37.854 --> 15:41.608
Something here
knows things about us,

15:41.691 --> 15:44.527
and it knows
which buttons to push.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.447
[knock on door]

15:47.530 --> 15:49.491
[exhales]

15:49.574 --> 15:50.533
[knocking continues]

15:51.910 --> 15:53.745
I'm sorry.

15:53.828 --> 15:56.206
I know I shouldn't
be here, but...

15:56.289 --> 15:59.501
Victor is in my basement,
and he's in really bad shape.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.045
He said he only wants
to talk to you.

16:04.255 --> 16:06.383
I wouldn't have come
if it wasn't important.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.804
Just wait there.
I'll get my coat.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.764
I have to go.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.475
[Elgin] Hello?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.018
[door closes]

16:25.276 --> 16:26.736
-Hey.
-[Elgin gasps]

16:26.820 --> 16:28.530
If you're looking for drugs,
you're in the wrong spot.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.198
Oh, no, no.

16:30.281 --> 16:33.952
Uh, no, I was...
just looking for a Band-Aid.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.329
-Oh.
-I cut my foot.

16:36.413 --> 16:39.457
Mm. You better not
let Kristi or Marielle

16:39.540 --> 16:40.917
find you rooting
through their shit.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.171
You hear about Tillie?

16:45.255 --> 16:46.381
Yeah.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.259
It's fucked up.

16:53.763 --> 16:56.933
Hey. I'm sorry
I was so hard on you

16:57.016 --> 16:58.601
on the bus that day.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.729
I guess you were right.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.106
We should've turned around.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.193
Sorry I, uh, threw up
all over your shirt.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.570
[chuckles] Yeah.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.453
[door opens]

17:19.789 --> 17:20.999
[door closes]

17:32.343 --> 17:33.470
[Sara] Victor?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.766
Oh.

17:37.849 --> 17:40.518
Oh. Oh, you're here.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.604
-[Tabitha] Hi, Victor. Hi.
-Good. Come.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.813
Hey.

17:45.482 --> 17:48.401
[grunts]
You sit... come sit here.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.278
-Okay.
-There. Take this.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.654
Okay.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.531
-Okay.
-Victor, what are we...

17:53.615 --> 17:56.242
You were there. You were there
when I remembered Eloise,

17:56.326 --> 17:59.204
so you're the one
that can make him talk.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.538
Okay, Victor,
I'm so sorry.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.081
I don't know--
I don't understand.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.042
He needs to tell me!
You need to make him tell me.

18:04.125 --> 18:06.211
[Tabitha]
Tell you what, Victor?

18:06.294 --> 18:08.213
[Victor] The secrets
that he told Christopher

18:08.296 --> 18:10.131
'cause he can help us.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.383
[Tabitha] I'm sorry, honey.
He's--he's just a doll.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.052
[Victor] No!
No, you have to be the one!

18:14.135 --> 18:15.512
You have to be the one!

18:15.595 --> 18:17.972
-Okay, okay!
-You have to be the one!

18:18.056 --> 18:20.141
-[Tabitha] Victor! Hey! Hey!
-You have to be the one!

18:20.225 --> 18:21.976
-You have to be the one!
-Hey! Victor, stop it!

18:22.060 --> 18:23.728
-Stop it! Don't do that!
-You have to be the one.

18:23.812 --> 18:25.814
Calm down.
Don't do that, Victor, please.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.359
Shh. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.195
Look at me, Victor.
It's okay. You're okay.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.905
-[Tabitha] You're okay.
-Okay.

18:33.988 --> 18:34.864
-It's okay.
-Yeah.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.908
Do you want
to draw a picture?

18:36.991 --> 18:41.454
No. No, it doesn't work
like that.

18:41.538 --> 18:43.248
See, the pictures
always remembered

18:43.331 --> 18:45.166
so that I didn't have to.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.461
But I never drew one,

18:48.545 --> 18:51.047
so now it's gone,
and I can't--

18:51.130 --> 18:53.007
I can't remember.

18:53.091 --> 18:55.510
No. No, okay, okay.
First of all, sit down.

18:55.593 --> 18:59.347
It's okay. You're okay.
You're okay. Sit down, okay?

19:01.391 --> 19:02.934
It's okay, Victor.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.310
Just sit down.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.445
It's okay, Victor.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.823
Nothing is gone.
Nothing's gone.

19:16.906 --> 19:20.034
It's okay. Um...

19:20.118 --> 19:22.495
Tell me about--
tell me about the doll.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.831
His name is Jasper.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.584
Jasper? Okay.
Uh, tell me about Jasper.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.377
I heard him once,

19:29.460 --> 19:32.881
telling Christopher things
that we need to know.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.841
But I don't remember.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.927
[Tabitha] Hey, it's okay.
Victor, look at me.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.262
-But...
-Look at me.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.347
We'll remember together,

19:41.431 --> 19:43.558
just like last time.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.226
-Okay.
-We can do this together, okay?

19:45.310 --> 19:46.394
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.563
Yeah. [sniffs]

19:51.316 --> 19:52.859
Hello?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.360
Anyone home?

19:54.444 --> 19:55.695
Hey.

19:55.778 --> 19:59.532
Uh... how were things
at the settlement?

19:59.616 --> 20:01.826
Uh, not great.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.620
Oh.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.830
Listen,
your brother's upstairs.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.457
Would you mind
hanging with him for a bit?

20:07.540 --> 20:10.376
-Well, where are you going?
-Something I gotta take care of.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.920
Okay?

20:12.003 --> 20:14.714
-But...
-[door opens]

20:14.797 --> 20:16.424
[door closes]

20:16.507 --> 20:19.177
[knock on door]

20:19.260 --> 20:20.178
[door opens]

20:21.971 --> 20:23.431
Ethan?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.523
You doing okay?

20:32.607 --> 20:34.859
-I'm fine.
-'Cause I thought,

20:34.943 --> 20:38.029
maybe you might wanna
go see something really cool.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.996
My wife had visions
of this place.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.918
Yeah, I've heard.

20:52.001 --> 20:54.545
I thought she was crazy.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.090
I should've
listened to her.

20:57.173 --> 21:01.386
Well... shoulda,
woulda, coulda, right?

21:02.720 --> 21:04.263
What exactly makes you think

21:04.347 --> 21:06.849
you're gonna be
the one to figure this out?

21:06.933 --> 21:09.894
I imagine a lot of pretty
smart people have tried.

21:11.688 --> 21:12.814
-[door opens]
-I'm smarter.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.816
-Oh.
-Oh, please, come on in.

21:14.899 --> 21:17.318
Make yourself
at home.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.114
It's done.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.199
Right now.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.493
Do you understand me?

21:25.576 --> 21:27.203
What are we talking about?

21:27.286 --> 21:30.623
Who the fuck do you think you
are dragging my wife and kid

21:30.707 --> 21:33.334
out into the middle
of the woods?

21:33.418 --> 21:35.837
Okay, first of all,

21:35.920 --> 21:38.756
I didn't drag anybody anywhere--
-I only wanna say this once.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.343
Tabitha is not
in a good place right now.

21:42.427 --> 21:45.304
She doesn't need you
filling her head with ideas

21:45.388 --> 21:47.932
about how somehow,
she's this chosen savior,

21:48.016 --> 21:49.934
responsible for getting
everybody home--

21:50.018 --> 21:53.104
You get
your fucking hands off me!

21:53.187 --> 21:56.524
Filling her head with ideas?
What is she, nine?

21:56.607 --> 22:00.987
Jim, she--she came here!
She came here, okay?

22:01.070 --> 22:03.656
She saw the drawings,
she recognized the, uh, s--

22:03.740 --> 22:05.742
You know what? I don't need
to explain this to you.

22:05.825 --> 22:09.537
All right, then,
let me explain this to you.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.873
You are a lonely, selfish,

22:11.956 --> 22:14.542
narcissistic asshole,
who doesn't give a shit

22:14.625 --> 22:18.004
about anything but yourself
and your own goddamn ego.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.381
If you wanna kill yourself
trying to figure this thing out,

22:20.465 --> 22:21.591
be my guest.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.051
But I have a family
to look out for.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.594
-Mm.
-I have people

22:24.677 --> 22:26.763
who mean more to me
than you will ever understand.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.390
Jim, I'm getting
a little tired

22:29.474 --> 22:31.976
of this sanctimonious
blue-collar bullshit.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.686
You wanna talk
about your family?

22:33.770 --> 22:36.439
Let's talk about your family.
Of the two of us,

22:36.522 --> 22:39.317
I am the only one doing
a goddamn thing to help them!

22:39.400 --> 22:40.485
[scoffs]

22:40.568 --> 22:42.403
Look at this!
You see this?

22:42.487 --> 22:44.238
This--
this helps people!

22:44.322 --> 22:46.365
No! You know
what this does?!

22:46.449 --> 22:50.119
This shows people
how you are the smartest

22:50.203 --> 22:51.412
fucking prick in the room!

22:51.496 --> 22:53.164
So what?!

22:53.247 --> 22:58.044
If it gets us home,
who gives a shit?!

22:59.670 --> 23:00.838
And I'm not gonna do this.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.173
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna do this.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.841
I'm not gonna waste
any more of my time.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.511
Listen, if you wanna keep
your kids under lock and key,

23:06.594 --> 23:08.971
more power to you.
Tabitha's a grown-up.

23:09.055 --> 23:12.058
You got a problem with what
she's doing, talk to her.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.518
Sorry.
We're not done here!

23:13.601 --> 23:16.354
Yeah, we fucking are, Jim!

23:16.437 --> 23:17.605
[grunts]

23:18.981 --> 23:20.942
Well, that was
certainly productive.

23:24.695 --> 23:26.197
[Ellis] Fatima?

23:35.706 --> 23:37.583
Hey. Come here.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.463
We're gonna get
this through this, okay?

23:42.547 --> 23:46.843
Ellis, I need you and your dad
to stop saying that.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.345
I killed someone.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.555
How, I mean--help me.

23:50.638 --> 23:52.181
No, listen to me.
Listen to me.

23:52.265 --> 23:54.350
Whatever this is,

23:54.433 --> 23:56.310
it's you and I.

23:56.394 --> 23:57.728
We are in this together.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.105
I don't care if we need
to take that talisman

23:59.188 --> 24:00.982
and go live in the woods.

24:01.065 --> 24:04.944
No. You don't understand.
Ellis, whatever is inside me,

24:05.027 --> 24:07.321
whatever made me...
it's still there.

24:07.405 --> 24:09.365
-No. Babe, hey.
-It's still there. I...

24:09.448 --> 24:11.325
What if it happens again?

24:11.409 --> 24:12.952
What if I--what if I--
what if I do something...

24:13.035 --> 24:16.414
You--You won't. You won't.
Look at me. Look at me.

24:16.497 --> 24:17.790
You won't. Okay?

24:17.874 --> 24:20.126
Because you are
stronger than this.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.337
Whatever this is,
we are stronger than this.

24:24.630 --> 24:25.756
Okay?

24:25.840 --> 24:27.425
Fatima?

24:30.178 --> 24:31.262
Okay.

24:37.935 --> 24:40.438
I brought you some things.

24:40.521 --> 24:42.523
Some...

24:42.607 --> 24:44.275
Some clothes
if you wanna change.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.110
-[bag thuds]
-Hey...

24:49.238 --> 24:51.657
Lucky handkerchief.
Remember?

24:53.701 --> 24:55.036
I love you.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.829
I love you, too.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.541
Okay.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.711
I'll be back soon.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.546
Okay.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.340
Okay. Soon.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.293

People swallowed it.

40:32.889 --> 40:35.851
But they certainly
did not understand it!

40:35.934 --> 40:39.104
They let it go because
you told them they had to.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.772
Great, then,
I will tell them again!

40:40.856 --> 40:43.400
-It's not gonna work this time.
-Why not?

40:43.483 --> 40:44.901
Because they don't
believe in you anymore.

40:48.196 --> 40:49.823
Not like they did.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.451
I'll tell them I did it.

40:53.535 --> 40:55.078
-No, no, no!
-No, no, I'll, I'll--I did it!

40:55.162 --> 40:57.372
-No, no, no, it's not enough!
-Why?

40:57.455 --> 41:00.667
Because it doesn't change
that it made it happen

41:00.750 --> 41:02.794
in the first place!

41:02.878 --> 41:07.299
There is either something
horrible growing inside of her,

41:07.382 --> 41:10.051
or else this place
has finally broken her mind!

41:10.135 --> 41:13.889
Either way, it's only a matter
of time before it happens again!

41:15.265 --> 41:16.725
They can stay with me.

41:16.808 --> 41:17.893
[exhales heavily]

41:17.976 --> 41:20.145
She won't be
a threat to anyone else.

41:20.228 --> 41:22.105
I can watch her.
We can watch her.

41:22.189 --> 41:25.942
No, no, no, Boyd. Boyd, you may
both want this to be okay,

41:26.026 --> 41:28.069
and God knows
I want it to be okay, too.

41:28.153 --> 41:32.782
But if you are not gonna
tell everyone, then I am.

41:35.202 --> 41:38.121
Please, don't make me
do this.

41:49.758 --> 41:50.884
[door closes]

41:57.807 --> 41:59.309
What are you doing?

42:02.520 --> 42:03.688
You're gonna need supplies.

42:09.402 --> 42:13.281
[Victor] It was in the basement.
It happened in the basement.

42:15.283 --> 42:18.203
When I opened the door,
I heard voices.

42:18.286 --> 42:21.414
So, I was quiet,
and I wanted to get closer.

42:27.629 --> 42:29.005
When I got...

42:29.089 --> 42:32.634
to the bottom of the stairs,

42:32.717 --> 42:34.886
Jasper was telling secrets.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.137
[muted speech]

42:38.431 --> 42:42.477
-[muted speech]
-Christopher got angry.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.522
[continues, muted]

42:49.776 --> 42:52.237
No, no, that's not right.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.072
It wasn't Jasper.

42:54.155 --> 42:57.158
[muted speech continues]

42:57.242 --> 42:59.953
It was the boy in white.

43:00.036 --> 43:01.454
He was the one
that was down here.

43:01.538 --> 43:04.499
He who was telling secrets
to Christopher.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.961
[muted] The answers to the end
are at the beginning.

43:08.044 --> 43:11.881
He said, "The answers to
the end are at the beginning."

43:11.965 --> 43:13.550
[boy in white, muted]
It started with the children.

43:13.633 --> 43:16.678
That it started
with the children...

43:16.761 --> 43:19.597
-What the others did to them.
-...what the others did to them.

43:19.681 --> 43:21.266
What others, Victor?

43:21.349 --> 43:23.643
The people they loved.

43:25.437 --> 43:26.771
The people they trusted.

43:26.855 --> 43:28.523
The children are born
in the dark.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.108
[Victor] He said the children
were born in the dark.

43:30.191 --> 43:31.818
[boy in white, muted] And then
they were murdered in the dark.

43:31.901 --> 43:35.613
And then they were murdered...
in the dark.

43:36.948 --> 43:39.159
[muted] But someone
who loved them...

43:39.242 --> 43:40.994
But someone who loved them...

43:41.077 --> 43:43.997
-...told them a story.
-...told them a story.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.958
The story gave them hope.

43:47.042 --> 43:50.545
And when the children
laid on the stones,

43:50.628 --> 43:52.672
they poured their hope

43:52.756 --> 43:54.716
into the roots
that made the symbol,

43:54.799 --> 43:56.176
and those roots became the tree.

43:56.259 --> 43:58.011
The Faraway Tree.

43:58.094 --> 44:00.013
The boy in white was
trying to tell Christopher

44:00.096 --> 44:03.767
that to save the children...

44:03.850 --> 44:06.102
he would have
to go through the tree.

44:06.186 --> 44:08.855
But he wouldn't--
he wouldn't listen, and he--

44:08.938 --> 44:10.648
he got angry.

44:10.732 --> 44:13.860
[muted] You're a liar!
Everything lies here!

44:13.943 --> 44:17.238
Christopher
wouldn't listen, so I-I...

44:21.201 --> 44:22.619
What?

44:24.162 --> 44:26.581
Christopher wouldn't
go to the tree, so...

44:31.961 --> 44:34.714
I told my mother
what the boy in white said.

44:39.386 --> 44:41.679
And that's why she left us.

44:53.108 --> 44:54.984
[Elgin] Fatima?

44:56.319 --> 44:57.779
It's Elgin.

44:57.862 --> 45:00.198
[door creaks open]

45:01.950 --> 45:02.992
You...

45:06.538 --> 45:10.375
Okay, stay close, all right?
But not too close.

45:10.458 --> 45:13.920
Four or five hours out,
that should be, uh, enough.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.755
[Ellis] Okay.

45:15.839 --> 45:18.591
And, whatever you do, you stay
off the path to the settlement.

45:18.675 --> 45:22.303
Last thing we want is anybody
tripping over your tent.

45:25.056 --> 45:27.725
I'm gonna leave supplies for
you at the shack twice a week.

45:27.809 --> 45:30.478
You need anything,
you leave a note behind.

45:30.562 --> 45:32.272
-Okay.
-You bring a pen and pad?

45:32.355 --> 45:33.940
Yeah, it's in the pack.

45:34.023 --> 45:35.191
And if things...

45:37.861 --> 45:42.866
Look, if things get worse,
you promise me that you'll...

45:48.538 --> 45:50.373
Look, um, Dad,

45:50.457 --> 45:54.335
I know you don't
want me to do this,

45:54.419 --> 45:58.882
but if you'd had the chance,
if you and Mom coulda ran,

45:58.965 --> 46:00.717
even after she did
what she did...

46:00.800 --> 46:01.968
what would you have done?

46:07.432 --> 46:09.684
[whispers] Come on.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.562
Let's go. Come on.
Come on.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.917
No.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.668
Fatima?!

46:35.752 --> 46:37.879
What? Fatima!

46:39.214 --> 46:41.591
Fatima!

46:41.674 --> 46:42.634
Fatima!

46:45.470 --> 46:47.096
-Almost there.
-Elgin, where are we going?

46:47.180 --> 46:49.724
It's just through here.
It's...

46:49.807 --> 46:52.185
Are you sure we're supposed
to be this close to town?

46:52.268 --> 46:54.687
I told you.

46:54.771 --> 46:56.689
Ellis is waiting
for you.

46:56.773 --> 46:59.484
Right here,

46:59.567 --> 47:02.737
there's a room down here

47:02.820 --> 47:04.614
that nobody knows about.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.908
[grunts]

47:06.991 --> 47:09.494
Come on. Please.

47:09.577 --> 47:11.120
Fatima.

47:16.793 --> 47:19.629
[breathing heavily]

47:35.687 --> 47:37.647
It's right through there.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.651
[Fatima] Ellis?

47:45.238 --> 47:48.825
I, uh, I'll wait
for him at the shack.

47:48.908 --> 47:50.618
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You can't do that.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.704
Elgin, get out of my way.

47:52.787 --> 47:56.249
No, you don't understand.
You have to be here.

47:56.332 --> 47:57.292
It's the only place
that the baby will be safe.

47:57.375 --> 48:00.128
-There is no baby.
-Yes, there is.

48:02.171 --> 48:04.507
It...
It's just not yours.

48:13.850 --> 48:15.059
Elgin, get out of my way.

48:15.143 --> 48:17.228
Get out of my way!
Get out of my--

48:17.312 --> 48:18.646
Elgin! Get out of my way!

48:18.730 --> 48:21.190
-Fatima!
-Aah! [groans]

48:23.151 --> 48:24.611
[groans]

48:24.694 --> 48:26.863
[gasping and groaning]

48:26.946 --> 48:29.115
You see?

48:29.198 --> 48:30.658
The baby knows
you have to stay.

48:30.742 --> 48:32.994
[groaning] Elgin, stop.

48:33.077 --> 48:36.122
Fighting it is just
going to make it worse.

48:36.205 --> 48:39.626
Elgin, get out of my way.
Please, get out of my way.

48:39.709 --> 48:42.086
Elgin, get out of my way.

48:42.170 --> 48:43.755
Get out of my way!

I'm sorry.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.640
I really am.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

No! No!

This is for the best.

No, please! Help!
