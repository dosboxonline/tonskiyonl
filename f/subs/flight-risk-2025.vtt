Oh, hell.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.575
-Everything okay?
-Yeah, it's fine.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.777
Nothing to worry about.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.279
This piece of crap
keeps shorting out on me.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.380
There's no GPS?

13:00.413 --> 13:01.614
It's no big deal, really.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.551
I mean,
it happens twice a week.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.287
It's not serious.
I fly this route all the time.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.623
75 minutes from now,
we'll be on the ground,

13:10.657 --> 13:12.759
and you and your friend
or witness,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.462
be on your way to Seattle,
I promise.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.864
You don't think
we should turn back?

13:16.897 --> 13:19.933
No, heck no.
I mean, it's your call.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.401
I mean, I get paid either way.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.436
There's some weather
moving in from the north.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.704
We head back now,

13:24.737 --> 13:26.306
it's probably gonna ground us
for a few hours.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.108
75 minutes.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.409
I know the way.
I'm gonna get you there.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.999
How long you been
with the Marshals?

13:52.933 --> 13:55.602
Uh, seven, almost eight years.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.640
-You like it?
-It has its moments.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.342
Whoa! What the shit was that?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.012
We're all good.

14:06.013 --> 14:07.780
-Sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

14:07.814 --> 14:10.483
Bird strike is all.
Not a big deal.

14:11.184 --> 14:12.452
Unless you the bird.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.155
Yeah. I better
get a little higher

14:15.188 --> 14:17.324
in case there's more.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.027
Well, can't go too high
or I'll pass out.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.534
-You good?
-Is the plane...

14:27.567 --> 14:29.069
Ah, the plane's fine.

14:30.337 --> 14:31.504
I'm gonna have
to spend my evening

14:31.538 --> 14:32.973
scrubbing blood off of it,

14:33.006 --> 14:35.008
but could have been worse.
Could have been a prop chop.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.310
I'd be picking feathers
out of the intakes all week.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.189

14:53.160 --> 14:55.795

14:55.828 --> 14:57.297
Dancing for
your entertainment.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.165
Oh, come on now.
She's resilient.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.535
Yeah, I know.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.104
Look at me with them
ten dollar words, right?

15:05.672 --> 15:06.873
Don't tell nobody.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.141
But the fact is,

15:08.175 --> 15:09.542
she just keeps dancing
through all the bumps

15:09.576 --> 15:12.980
and turns and turbulence.
Nothing fazes her.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.948

-What was that?

-I... I need to talk to you.
-What?

I don't care, Winston.
Suck it up.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.808
No, it's like I feel
really bad.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.578
Like I got a bad feeling.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.614
I think we should turn around.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.383
Just take some
deep breaths, Winston.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.784
You'll be fine.

16:55.882 --> 16:58.551
About an hour-ish. Soon.

civilization again?

-Earlier.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.122
You said you'd have us
on our way to Seattle

17:35.155 --> 17:36.356
before we knew it.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.857
How'd you know
that's where we're headed?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.360
Well, shit.
Where else can you go?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.330
You ain't no Alaskan.
I can tell you that.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.399
Ain't no way you're staying
in Anchorage. No offense.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.869
In fact, if I had to guess,

17:49.902 --> 17:51.604
I'd say you got that
Yankee blood.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.407
Not much of an accent, but...

17:54.441 --> 17:56.543
you remind me of this gal
I used to fiddle with.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.881
Can I radio ATC on these?
I need to check in.

and a welding torch.

some stories about her, too.

No! I'm not okay.

26:48.775 --> 26:50.376
What are we supposed to do?

26:50.409 --> 26:52.111
Just let me think
for a second.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.924
-What are you looking for?
-The knife.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.192
I need to get these off.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.960
-Hey!
-What?

27:07.994 --> 27:09.328
The first aid kit.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.544
Fuck.

Come on. I can help.
Just unlock me.

-Really?

I'm gonna do?

Fine.

-Easy.
-You know what?

You got trust issues, lady.

I got it. I got it.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.200
Thank you.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.739
Okay. That wasn't
so hard, was it?

27:52.772 --> 27:55.107
We need to get him into
the back before he wakes up.

27:55.141 --> 27:56.943
Oh, fuck that. Shoot him.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.144

fly into the wilderness

and murder the shit out of us.

was off about this guy

he got in here,

They could kill her.

to calm down?

hurt a soul in her life.

and it's gonna be my fault.

Do you get how that must feel?

We're gonna
figure this out, okay?

31:08.300 --> 31:09.635
Your mom is still alive.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.971
-You don't know that.
-Yes, I do. I do know that.

31:12.004 --> 31:15.541
I know Moretti has no leverage
over you if she's dead, right?

31:15.574 --> 31:18.310
-Yeah, I guess.
-So I know she's still alive.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.712
I also know that
you can't change the past.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.181
All we can do is choose

31:22.214 --> 31:25.284
how to respond
in this moment, okay?

31:25.317 --> 31:27.653
So I'm gonna get on the radio
and we're gonna get help.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.056
For us. For your mom.

31:30.089 --> 31:31.457
And then we're gonna
get you to New York

31:31.490 --> 31:33.892
so you can testify
and put Moretti away for good.

31:36.328 --> 31:37.429

let me sit up there with you.

32:05.024 --> 32:07.559

32:07.593 --> 32:10.429
You really want to help?
How did you know about Daryl?

Just trying to keep us alive.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.708
-Come on.
-Thank you.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.514
You piss yourself again,
I'm sending you back.

32:28.547 --> 32:29.982
That's all right. I'm empty.

to find us, right?

32:43.562 --> 32:44.730
I mean, when we don't show up?

32:44.763 --> 32:45.964
Oh, we're showing up.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.034
Oh, yeah, no,
we're showing up. For sure.

32:48.067 --> 32:52.604
But, uh, if we don't,
they know our route, right?

32:52.638 --> 32:56.708
Our route? There's no way
he was taking us to Anchorage.

32:56.742 --> 32:57.809
Yeah, you know,
I'm really starting

32:57.843 --> 32:59.011
to question his honesty.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.382
But look,
there's gotta be some way

33:03.415 --> 33:04.483
they could locate us, right?

33:04.516 --> 33:05.651
Like an emergency signal

33:05.684 --> 33:07.753
or like a black box
or something?

33:07.786 --> 33:11.290
Winston, the radio, the GPS,
he didn't want us to be found.

33:12.524 --> 33:15.394
Hello. Can anybody read me?

33:15.427 --> 33:17.329
-We're gonna crash.
-Mayday. Mayday.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.632
Quiet. No we're not.
Can anybody hear me?

33:20.666 --> 33:22.434
I'm on a plane
and I need help.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.805
Help. Help.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.507

33:28.540 --> 33:30.842
Yes. Hello. Can you hear me?

33:30.876 --> 33:32.311
I can hear you.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.580
Yeah, I read you. Say again.

33:34.613 --> 33:36.748
Help. I need help.

33:36.782 --> 33:39.285
This is an aviation frequency.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.953
Yes, I know. I'm on a plane.

33:41.987 --> 33:44.156
You don't sound like a pilot.

33:44.190 --> 33:48.260
No, I'm... I'm not.
My pilot, he...

33:48.294 --> 33:49.861
-Still there? Hello?
-He's in...

33:49.895 --> 33:52.998
He's incapacitated.
Unconscious.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.466
I'm flying his plane

33:54.500 --> 33:56.268
and I don't know
what I'm doing.

-All right, I get it.
-Hello?

33:57.969 --> 33:59.571

didn't he?

33:59.605 --> 34:00.972
You're kidding, right?

34:01.006 --> 34:04.443
What? No, I'm not kidding.
Please give me some help.

34:04.476 --> 34:08.147
Oh. Oh. Oh, shit.
I'm sorry, okay.

34:08.179 --> 34:09.715
Okay. First thing's first.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.150
Um, did you engage your pilot?

34:12.184 --> 34:13.219
What the fuck is he saying?

34:15.754 --> 34:17.389
Yes. Yes, it's on.

34:17.422 --> 34:19.858
Okay, that'll maintain your
heading and keep you level.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.527
Just keep your hands off
the yokes for now.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.895
What's your altitude?
Can you see?

34:23.929 --> 34:26.031
It should be a big gauge
right in front.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.167
Can you hear me?

34:29.168 --> 34:31.237
Three. 3000 feet.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.571
Okay, you're a little low,

34:32.603 --> 34:34.406
but we're not going
to worry about that yet.

34:34.440 --> 34:36.242
What's your location?

34:37.743 --> 34:40.978
Uh, somewhere between
Bethel and Anchorage.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.415
I don't know.
All I see is mountains.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.918
I think we may have drifted
pretty far off course here.

34:47.953 --> 34:51.056
Okay, well, I can't be too far
away if I can... (STATIC) you.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.824
Can you see any landmarks?

34:52.858 --> 34:54.159

34:54.193 --> 34:56.527
You're breaking up a little.
Can you say again?

34:56.562 --> 34:57.696
I said...

34:57.729 --> 34:58.930
(DISTORTED)

35:00.866 --> 35:02.468

-Hello...

Hello? Hello?

35:09.375 --> 35:12.278
-Hello? Can anybody hear me?
-He'll call it in, right?

35:13.445 --> 35:14.546
Wait, what did you say?

35:14.580 --> 35:15.614
He's got to call in

35:15.647 --> 35:17.349
the situation, right,
the pilot guy?

35:17.383 --> 35:18.717
He's got to call it in.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.288
What?

35:22.321 --> 35:24.456
(GROANS) Madolyn.
Where'd you leave your brain?

35:27.826 --> 35:30.396
-Out here?
-It's a satellite phone.

35:30.429 --> 35:31.830
-Doesn't use cell towers.
-(DIALING)

35:33.465 --> 35:34.833
Come on. Come on.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.036
-VAN SANT: Madolyn?
-Caroline.

35:38.069 --> 35:39.705
Oh, God! Oh, thank God.

35:39.738 --> 35:40.806
Listen.

35:40.839 --> 35:42.140
You can't be
in Anchorage already.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.042
No, no, no.
We're still in the air.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.311
We've been compromised.

35:45.344 --> 35:47.546
I can barely hear you, Mads.
Hello? Hello?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.080
Hang on.

35:49.114 --> 35:50.716
Hey, Chet, drop the muffin,
please, and get over here.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.050
The rest of you
shut the fuck up.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.219
We've been compromised.

35:53.252 --> 35:54.753
The pilot wasn't
who he says he was.

35:54.786 --> 35:56.488
-He's one of Moretti's.
-You think?

35:56.522 --> 35:58.156
Wait, what?

35:58.190 --> 36:00.292
I caught him in a lie
and he tried to knife me.

36:00.326 --> 36:02.628
-Are... Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.596
He's unconscious
and restrained in the back.

36:04.630 --> 36:07.065
-And the witness?
-Winston, he's fine.

36:07.098 --> 36:09.268
Yeah, never been better.
Thanks.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.670
Mads, question.
Who's flying the plane?

36:11.703 --> 36:13.239
-I am.
-You?

36:13.272 --> 36:15.607
I'm flying this plane and I
don't know what I'm doing.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.775
Okay. Okay.

36:16.808 --> 36:18.109
Well, we just need
to stay calm.

36:18.143 --> 36:19.345
I'm calm.

36:19.378 --> 36:21.112
All right, so you are
flying the plane

36:21.146 --> 36:23.415
and just so I understand it.

36:23.449 --> 36:25.984
-How exactly?
-It's on autopilot.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.753
We're sort of cruising
in a straight line.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.521
I think he sabotaged
the navigation.

36:29.555 --> 36:31.189
Sims, see if we can
track her on radar.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.358
-Yes, ma'am.
-I need someone to help me

36:32.391 --> 36:33.925
-fly this thing.
-Yup, we're gonna find

36:33.959 --> 36:35.861
your pilot who's gonna walk
you through it. Sit tight.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.296
Smith, get me a fucking pilot.

36:37.329 --> 36:38.530
Okay, I'll wait for his call.

36:38.564 --> 36:41.199
-Hey, hey, hey. My mom.
-Oh, yes, yes.

36:41.233 --> 36:42.601
You need to send some officers

36:42.634 --> 36:44.102
over to Winston's
mother's house, okay?

36:44.135 --> 36:45.471
She may be in danger.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.439
Okay, all right.
Don't worry. We're on it.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.475
-I will call you back.
-Okay.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.678
-So?
-Finding us a pilot.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.812
Hey!

36:55.414 --> 36:57.349
Y'all need a pilot? (CHUCKLES)

37:00.018 --> 37:01.453
(LAUGHS)

37:01.487 --> 37:04.290
Hot damn!
That taser's no joke.

37:04.323 --> 37:06.191
We like our pilots crispy.

37:08.527 --> 37:09.928
Tell me how to fly this thing.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.998
Um, no.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.170
I think I bit my tongue.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.206
Although I was dreaming

37:21.239 --> 37:22.874
that you were nibbling
on my nipple, Twiggy.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.544
Was that you?

37:25.577 --> 37:27.579
Or was that
just my imagination?

37:27.613 --> 37:29.348
Who told you we were
moving Winston today?

37:30.949 --> 37:33.084
I'll tell you what.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.387
Why don't you come on
back here with me,

37:35.421 --> 37:37.423
and I'll tell you
all about it.

37:37.456 --> 37:38.857
We could play
hide-the-hot dog.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.996
Easy now.

37:45.030 --> 37:46.398
You're awful close
with that thing.

37:46.432 --> 37:49.234
-Makes it hard to miss.
-Shoot him now.

37:49.267 --> 37:50.836
-Yeah.
-Do it.

37:50.869 --> 37:52.070
Also makes it more than likely

37:52.103 --> 37:54.039
that that bullet's gonna
pass clear through me

37:54.072 --> 37:56.041
and into the wall behind me.

37:56.074 --> 37:58.410
Where the fuel line
and the fuel tank is.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.712
You could put a hole in it.

38:01.547 --> 38:02.848
Or it could ricochet around

38:02.881 --> 38:04.215
right into
one of you fuckheads.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.453
Yeah.

38:09.921 --> 38:12.223
Now, I know
you ain't much for planes.

38:12.257 --> 38:13.459
But surely you know
a thing or two

38:13.492 --> 38:15.060
about how bullets work,
don't you?

38:17.663 --> 38:20.566
Yeah.
Quite the pickle, ain't it?

38:24.002 --> 38:25.537
(DARYL LAUGHS)

38:25.571 --> 38:27.773
Okay. I'll make you
a deal, chuckles.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.375
You tell me
how to fly this thing,

38:29.408 --> 38:30.576
I'll let you
go to prison in peace.

38:32.277 --> 38:34.513
Pass. Option B?

38:34.546 --> 38:37.148
I'll put it out there
that you turned on Moretti.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.250
And you can go to prison
looking over your shoulder

38:39.284 --> 38:41.086
for the rest of what'll be
a very short life.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.188
Clearly you're mistaking me
for somebody

38:43.221 --> 38:45.791
who actually
gives a fuck about that.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.126
I've spent every
waking day in prison

38:48.159 --> 38:49.595
looking over my shoulder.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.198
You get it, Twig?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.836
-You will.
-Yeah, no, I got it.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.104
(CHUCKLES)

38:59.137 --> 39:01.440
Come on, you really
wanna die out here?

39:01.473 --> 39:04.643
Honey, you gotta
land the plane first.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.011
At least, tell me
your real name.

39:09.381 --> 39:10.816
You know what's the last thing
to go through your head

39:10.849 --> 39:11.950
before crash landing?

39:14.786 --> 39:17.789
Your ass. (LAUGHS)

39:17.823 --> 39:20.258
-Oh, my God, he doesn't care.
-Or maybe his.

39:20.291 --> 39:21.460
He doesn't care
whether he lives or dies.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.128
-I care, Twiggy.
-He doesn't care at all.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.262
-(RINGING)
-This is Harris.

39:24.295 --> 39:25.464
-I care about you.
-HASSAN: Hey there,

39:25.497 --> 39:26.598
-Deputy Harris
-WINSTON: We're gonna die.

39:26.632 --> 39:27.666
My name's Hassan.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.167
He doesn't care
if he lives or dies.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.536
I am a pilot with air traffic
control in Anchorage.

39:30.569 --> 39:31.470
We're all gonna die with him
in this flying coffin!

39:31.503 --> 39:33.271
Will you shut up?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.940
I could shut up, yes,

39:34.973 --> 39:36.207
but it will make it
harder to help.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.810
No, no, no.
No, I didn't mean you. I...

39:38.844 --> 39:41.112
Hassan.
Or if you like, Hassan.

39:41.146 --> 39:42.781
And it's all good, Deputy.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.450
Sounds like things
are a little tense up there.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.452
Yeah, yeah,
you could say that.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.987
Well, not to worry.
We're in this together now.

39:49.020 --> 39:50.689
And we're going
to get you sorted out.

39:50.722 --> 39:53.024
You got an airspeed
and altitude for me?

39:53.058 --> 39:57.429
I... Yeah. 3,000 feet.
And airspeed is...

39:58.363 --> 40:00.231
It should be just to the left.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.568
With the green, yellow,
and red range on it.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.003
Got it. Airspeed is at 120.

40:05.036 --> 40:07.573
120 at 3,000. Roger.

40:07.606 --> 40:09.374
And what are you
doing after this?

40:10.609 --> 40:12.010
Excuse me?

40:12.043 --> 40:14.112
Myself, I haven't
eaten all day.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.582
You want to have
dinner with me?

40:16.615 --> 40:18.316
Yeah, if you insist.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.919
I mean, we should probably
focus on landing first.

40:20.952 --> 40:22.053
You're paying, though.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.355
Seems only fair
since you asked me.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.758
Of course. Fair's fair.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.259
That is a verbal commitment,

40:28.293 --> 40:29.895
and I'm going
to hold you to it.

40:29.928 --> 40:33.098
This day's looking up already.
At least for me.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.934
Okay, so when you're ready,

40:35.967 --> 40:37.903
you're just going to ease
that yoke to the left.

40:37.936 --> 40:39.004
Nice and gentle.

40:39.037 --> 40:40.405
Okay.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.410
-We're turning.
-Stellar.

40:47.946 --> 40:50.381
Now, I know you're anxious
to meet me and all,

40:50.415 --> 40:52.417
but just keep an eye
on our altitude.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.853
Make sure
you're holding steady.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.888
Now, would you like me
to make the reservation?

40:56.922 --> 40:59.558
You seem kind of busy.
I got this.

40:59.591 --> 41:02.260
Now, pull back
on the yoke a little.

41:02.894 --> 41:03.995
Okay.

41:06.665 --> 41:09.367
-We're good.
-I have no doubt.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.402
Now, there should be
a heading indicator,

41:11.436 --> 41:14.072
first thing above the yoke,
looks just like a compass.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.641
I see it.

41:15.674 --> 41:18.577
Okay, when you hit southeast,
just straighten out the plane.

41:20.779 --> 41:23.114
-How are you doing?
-Okay.

41:23.148 --> 41:24.415
Straightening.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.388
-Done.
-Stupendous.

41:30.421 --> 41:34.492
Now, do me a favor and engage
that autopilot switch again.

41:35.293 --> 41:36.895
(BEEPING)

41:36.928 --> 41:38.797
-Okay.
-Fantabulous.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.131
And you are good to go.

41:40.165 --> 41:42.167
Keep an eye out
for the coastline.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.735
When you hit it,
we'll bank left

41:43.769 --> 41:46.237
and follow it south
towards Anchorage.

41:46.271 --> 41:49.174
See that?
Practically home already.

41:49.207 --> 41:51.743
-Thank you.
-No thanks necessary.

41:51.777 --> 41:54.112
Believe me, the drinks
you'll be buying later

41:54.145 --> 41:56.414
will be more than enough.

41:56.447 --> 41:58.049
-Is that right?
-Oh, yeah.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.551
I like to drink a lot.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.687
Noted.

42:01.720 --> 42:03.589
I'm going to hop off now
to save your battery,

42:03.622 --> 42:04.690
but call this number

42:04.723 --> 42:06.792
when you spot
the coastline, okay?

42:06.825 --> 42:08.827
Or if you just miss
the sound of my voice.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.962
-I'll be counting the moments.
- (HANGS UP)

42:10.996 --> 42:12.330
(RUMBLING)

42:17.669 --> 42:19.470
(TENSE MUSIC PLAYING)

42:23.408 --> 42:25.944
You can call me
when you need me.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.980
I'll be right here.
Just hanging around.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.929
-(THUD)
-(DARYL GRUNTING)

43:07.018 --> 43:09.554
* How does it feel *

43:09.587 --> 43:12.057
* To treat me like you do *

43:12.090 --> 43:15.493
* You lay your hands upon me *

43:15.526 --> 43:17.328
* Tell me who you are *

43:17.362 --> 43:20.732
What were you waiting for?
Huh?

43:20.766 --> 43:23.068
Why didn't you just
kill us and toss us out?

43:23.869 --> 43:26.271
Fly all by my lonesome?

43:26.304 --> 43:28.606
It ain't every day you get
a captive audience, you know.

43:31.376 --> 43:32.377
Don't give me that.

43:33.344 --> 43:36.547
I know people, Twig. And you?

43:37.582 --> 43:39.284
Yeah, you like to watch.

43:42.821 --> 43:43.822
Hey.

43:44.555 --> 43:45.724
Hey!

43:49.094 --> 43:50.662
If it's any consolation,

43:52.664 --> 43:54.165
she's gonna watch, too.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.602
It's going to be
a real picnic.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.272
Winnie.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.477
Why don't you
come on back here?

44:06.511 --> 44:08.646
Why don't we start over, huh?

44:08.680 --> 44:10.481
Who you want to be?

44:10.515 --> 44:12.617
You want to be
the husband or the wife? Huh?

44:15.153 --> 44:17.856
How come you ain't sweet,
like your mommy?

44:19.624 --> 44:21.192
Your mommy's nice and sweet.

44:23.594 --> 44:24.595
She's real sweet.

44:25.697 --> 44:27.465
Just like mine.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.702
She loved me,
but she just wouldn't shut up.

44:34.773 --> 44:37.608
Come here, Winnie.
I wanna show you something.

44:41.446 --> 44:42.613
You're gonna like it.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.683
Maybe not at first.

44:46.852 --> 44:48.486
But they always
end up liking it.

44:51.622 --> 44:53.291
Oh, yeah. (GROANS)

44:56.327 --> 44:58.229
(GROWLING)

44:59.297 --> 45:00.398
Fuck!

45:25.757 --> 45:26.758
Hey, Winnie.

45:28.860 --> 45:30.128
After I kill you,

45:30.161 --> 45:31.629
I'm gonna take the Polaroids
to show your mama.

45:31.662 --> 45:34.732
Jesus, how does this asshole
know my mom's address?

45:36.534 --> 45:38.703
You think Moretti had someone
in the Marshal's office?

45:38.736 --> 45:40.906
I told that address
to the US Attorney

45:40.939 --> 45:43.208
when we were talking about
witness protection. That's it.

45:45.543 --> 45:48.046
I'm serious. I was careful.

45:48.079 --> 45:49.447
No one knows that address.

45:51.249 --> 45:53.484
-(PHONE RINGING)
-Caroline.

45:53.518 --> 45:55.420
Okay, so we're coordinating
with the military

45:55.453 --> 45:56.754
to get search and rescue up.

45:56.788 --> 45:58.323
It shouldn't be long now.

45:58.356 --> 46:01.059
Now, I'm told you're a little
small and low for radar,

46:01.092 --> 46:02.393
particularly with
all the mountains,

46:02.427 --> 46:04.095
so I'm trying to scramble
some fighter jets,

46:04.129 --> 46:06.264
get some extra eyeballs
out there.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.199
Okay, we're headed
for the coast,

46:08.233 --> 46:10.335
so maybe have them
sweep that first.

46:10.368 --> 46:12.437
Yeah... Um, look,
there's something else.

46:13.138 --> 46:14.572
Anchorage PD just found

46:14.605 --> 46:17.442
what's left of Daryl Booth
in his apartment.

46:17.475 --> 46:20.879
No eyes, no teeth, no fingers.

46:20.912 --> 46:23.714
It sounds like someone really
took their time with him.

46:32.958 --> 46:36.027
Someone talked.
Who knew about this op?

46:36.061 --> 46:39.364
Uh, I mean, we had to notify
local law enforcement,

46:39.397 --> 46:42.100
file a plan with the FAA,
alert the TSA, and...

46:42.133 --> 46:43.534
They knew we were
moving someone,

46:43.568 --> 46:44.769
but they didn't
know who, right?

46:44.802 --> 46:47.305
I mean, who actually
knew about Winston?

46:47.338 --> 46:50.808
Uh, well, the US Attorney,
the Director, obviously,

46:50.842 --> 46:53.711
-the AG, the Deputy AG.
-And you.

46:53.744 --> 46:56.114
Well, yes, of course,
but there's no telling

46:56.147 --> 46:57.883
who else may have
accessed that information.

46:57.916 --> 46:59.284
Did you see that?

47:00.585 --> 47:03.088
What the hell is that?

47:03.121 --> 47:05.156
I need to call you back.

47:05.190 --> 47:06.791
We're not gonna make that.
You gotta pull up.

47:06.824 --> 47:08.293
-Oh, my God.
-Nah, nah, you're fine.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.760
You got plenty of room left.

47:12.130 --> 47:13.731
Pull up.

47:13.764 --> 47:15.766
-Come on. Come on. Come on.
-Pull up. Pull up.

47:15.800 --> 47:17.635
-You gotta pull up!
-I am. I am!

47:17.668 --> 47:20.005
-I'm telling you, it's fine.
-Come on, damn it!

47:20.038 --> 47:22.173
-Shit. The autopilot!
-Come on!

47:22.207 --> 47:23.875
Whoa!

47:24.943 --> 47:27.645
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

47:30.215 --> 47:32.317
MADOLYN: Come on. Come on.

47:32.350 --> 47:33.618
Come on. Come on.

47:33.651 --> 47:34.953
(BOTH SCREAMING)

47:38.023 --> 47:39.524

48:59.470 --> 49:00.738
I don't know about you,

49:00.771 --> 49:02.473
but I just made
a Jackson Pollock in my pants.

I'm sure glad
you didn't kill Winston

to go through that shit again.

-Just ignore him.

you should be worried about.

Okay. When you're ready.

52:20.104 --> 52:22.039
Two years ago,

52:22.072 --> 52:24.509
we caught up with this
young woman, Maria.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.746
She'd been
on the run for weeks,

52:28.779 --> 52:31.582
and the DA convinced her
to turn against her boyfriend,

52:31.616 --> 52:33.083
who was a cartel boss.

52:34.819 --> 52:36.654
So we were holed up
in a shitty motel

52:36.687 --> 52:38.356
until she could testify.

52:40.758 --> 52:43.093
We'd been in the room
for three straight days,

52:44.462 --> 52:47.798
and she wanted to take
a shower, unsupervised.

52:48.799 --> 52:50.100
A moment of privacy.

52:56.106 --> 53:00.010
It was against protocol,
but I let her.

53:00.044 --> 53:02.847
So I shackled her to the tub
and stepped outside.

53:07.051 --> 53:09.487
A sicario smashed
a Molotov cocktail

53:09.520 --> 53:10.855
through the window.

53:13.958 --> 53:15.326
I turned back and...

53:17.695 --> 53:19.397
heat and smoke
and flames and...

53:24.869 --> 53:25.903
And I ran.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.842
But Maria,
with the shackles, she...

53:34.579 --> 53:35.913
she...

53:47.258 --> 53:48.926
And they put you on a desk.

53:51.329 --> 53:53.197
They said they didn't trust me
in the field again.

53:55.032 --> 53:59.036

54:15.620 --> 54:18.022
It's from us, Caroline.
It's the Marshals.

How did you get to that?

-What does Coleridge think?
-Why? This is my operation.

-You don't trust the director?
-Hey, I did not say that.

54:52.256 --> 54:54.959
I'm saying that if the leak
is in our office,

54:54.992 --> 54:56.093
as you say it is,

54:56.126 --> 54:58.262
then we need to be careful.

- (SIGHS) Just say it.
-That I thought it was you.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:19.116
Thought it was me. Fuck.

01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:21.686
I'm sorry. Look, you've gotta
get out of there.

01:00:21.719 --> 01:00:22.853
He's coming for you.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:24.221
Okay. All right.

01:00:24.254 --> 01:00:26.556
Just focus on landing
that plane safely, okay?

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:27.958
-I will handle this.
-Yeah.

01:00:27.992 --> 01:00:31.128
And Madolyn,
you know I love you.

01:00:31.161 --> 01:00:33.063
-But thanks a lot, bitch.
-Okay.

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:34.932
(HANGS UP)

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:37.434
Fuck!

01:00:49.279 --> 01:00:51.782
Okay, what is that?
Do you see that?

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.820
-What is that?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see it.

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:57.755
(CALL DIALING)

01:00:57.788 --> 01:00:58.923
Hassan.

01:00:58.956 --> 01:01:00.624
All ears, Deputy.
How can I help?

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.127
Uh, we see something.
It's like...

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:05.830
Uh... It's a... Like a boat.

01:01:05.863 --> 01:01:07.164
-A fishing boat.
-A big ship.

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:08.432
-A shipwreck.
-A shipwreck.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:10.735
Oh, shiver me timbers.
We can work with that.

01:01:10.768 --> 01:01:12.602
Can you see a name on it?

01:01:12.636 --> 01:01:13.804
Can you see a name on it?

01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:14.972
You gotta get me closer.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.140
Okay, we're too high.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.341
All right, if you
wanted to descend,

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:19.243
keep your pitch
at five degrees or less.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:22.446
And make sure you stay
above 1,000 feet, okay?

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:23.613
Okay.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.618
Uh, just a little bit closer.

01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:30.287
Can you see a name?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.356
Okay, okay, it says...

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:36.526
Fat Dancer?

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.627
-The Fat Dancer.
-The Fat...

01:01:37.661 --> 01:01:38.963
(CHUCKLES) The Fat Dancer?

01:01:38.996 --> 01:01:40.030
That doesn't make any sense.

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.165
He took my glasses.
I don't know.

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.801
The Fat Dancer?
Odd name for a boat.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:46.636
-The Fair Dancer.
-The Fair Dancer, yeah.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.806
-That makes a lot more sense.
-The Fair Dancer.

01:01:48.839 --> 01:01:50.875
The Fair Dancer.
Got it, okay, stand by.

01:01:50.908 --> 01:01:52.176
We're running it past
the Coast Guard now.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.210
Okay.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:12.196
You know, I'm something
of a fair dancer myself.

01:02:12.229 --> 01:02:14.031
(CHUCKLES) I have no doubt.

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:15.499
Well, let's boogie.

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.501
Because the Coast Guard
ID'd the wreck.

01:02:17.534 --> 01:02:19.469
We've got a pretty good fix
on your location.

01:02:19.503 --> 01:02:20.637
-Yeah?
-Yes.

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:22.206
-They see us.
-Whoo!

01:02:22.239 --> 01:02:23.808
We are grooving now.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:25.509
(LAUGHTER)

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:26.576
Thank God.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:28.846
It's a fucking
roller coaster ride.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.150
Okay. I guess
we gotta land at some point.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.318
Like a feather.

01:02:34.351 --> 01:02:35.385
Now, if you'd be so kind

01:02:35.419 --> 01:02:37.221
as to turn left
to heading 120,

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.722
that should
put you into Anchorage

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:39.857
in about 30 minutes.

01:02:39.890 --> 01:02:41.325
-Okay, copy.
-Here we come.

01:02:41.358 --> 01:02:43.527
-Turning 120.
-Here we come.

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.529
Stellar. Hold that heading.

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:46.931
I'll call back
in 10 minutes or so,

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.665
and we can talk landings.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.868
And the finer points of
tearing up the dance floor.

01:02:50.901 --> 01:02:52.436
I can't wait. Thank you.

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:55.105
We're gonna get out of this.
We're gonna get out of it!

01:02:59.309 --> 01:03:02.179
Twig! Pay attention.
This is the good part.

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:05.215
You ever see a face
turn this color before? Huh?

01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:08.685
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's for later.

01:03:08.718 --> 01:03:10.287
Oh, you know what?
Let me get that for you.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:11.755
(WINSTON SCREAMS)

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:14.124
Is that better? Oh, yeah.
I think I caught a rib there.

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:15.893
Maybe the spleen, too.

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.128
Don't worry. You don't
need a spleen to live.

01:03:18.162 --> 01:03:19.864
Hey, you want to know
my name, huh?

01:03:19.897 --> 01:03:21.866
Come on.
I'll give you three guesses.

01:03:21.899 --> 01:03:23.467
(GASPING)

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:25.735
Nope. No. That's not a name.

01:03:25.769 --> 01:03:27.938
Come on. Guess again.
Guess again.

(MADOLYN GASPING)

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.375
Nope. That's not a name.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:33.110
I'm only gonna give you
one more try.

what your fucking name is.

All right.
All right, let me see.

01:04:50.988 --> 01:04:53.690
-Come on. Let me see.
-Okay.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:56.593
Let me see. Come on. Come on.

01:05:00.364 --> 01:05:01.565
Okay.

01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:05.402
-Okay, it's fine.
-It's not fine.

-You're going to be fine.
-It's not fine.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:10.674
Just put some
pressure on it, okay?

01:05:10.707 --> 01:05:13.443
All right.
Let me put one of these on.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:20.384
Sorry. Another one here.
All right.

-Okay.
-All right.

There's morphine.
You want morphine?

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:26.223
No, I'm scared of needles.

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

-No, you're not.
-Don't lie to me. I am.

out of this, okay?

a little bit. Yeah.

What did I do?

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:31.721
He would have killed me.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:33.923
I told you to shoot him
when you had the chance.

01:06:38.962 --> 01:06:40.530
Okay, keep pressure on it.

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:46.603

doing up there?

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:20.870
Listen,
Winston's been stabbed.

01:07:21.738 --> 01:07:22.972
I... I'm sorry?

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:26.510
The pilot, uh, Booth,
or whatever his name is,

01:07:26.543 --> 01:07:29.213
-he got free and stabbed him.
-Oh, my God.

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.215
And I...
I shot him with a flare.

01:07:31.248 --> 01:07:33.617
A flare, okay.

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:36.986
-Hello?
-Yeah. Uh, copy. Stand by.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:38.888
All right.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.026
-Still there?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:45.395
Okay, I couldn't reach
Deputy Van Sant.

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.164
What is the status
of the witness?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:53.570
-Dire.
-I see.

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.173
Listen, we're gonna need some
real medical attention here.

01:07:56.206 --> 01:07:59.075
Copy. Tarmac EMS
is on standby.

01:07:59.109 --> 01:08:02.146
Okay. How far away are we?

01:08:02.179 --> 01:08:04.881
About 18 to 20 minutes out.

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:07.083
-Is there anything faster?
-Uh...

01:08:08.618 --> 01:08:10.053
-Hassan.
-Okay.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:11.488
Technically, we can
increase your speed.

01:08:11.521 --> 01:08:12.722
Great.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:15.192
But it'll burn through
the rest of your fuel.

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.393
We have no choice.

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:18.562
Deputy, I need you
to understand...

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.929
Listen, if Winston...

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.399
If Winston doesn't testify,
Coleridge walks,

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.700
Moretti walks.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:26.170
Understand, landing
will be more difficult.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.037
Look, I'm not
losing him, all right?

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:34.178
Okay. Open up the red
handle marked "fuel mix"

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:36.279
and then push
the throttle all the way in.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:39.183
Okay, approaching 160.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:41.084
Now, keep an eye on that fuel.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.386
I'll call you back
in a few minutes

01:08:42.419 --> 01:08:43.587
with the landing procedure.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.720
Okay.

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:50.160
All right, Winston?
Hang in there.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.596
-I am.
-Not long now.

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:04.741
Winston, how are you doing?

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.647
You mean, like in general?

01:09:30.033 --> 01:09:31.268
Uh-oh.

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.339
You're in trouble now.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:38.642
(COUGHS)

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:41.044
Hang in there.

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:47.617
I'm sorry.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:52.988
This is my fault.

01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:56.025
This is all my fault.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.129
That's the morphine talking.

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.398
No.

01:10:04.301 --> 01:10:05.735
I could've done anything.

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:09.172
I was one of those guys,
like in school,

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.841
I could've done anything.

01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:17.747
I could've gone to college.

01:10:20.517 --> 01:10:22.185
I could've got a good job.

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:27.324
But, uh, I wanted it easy.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:32.996
I knew what was going on,
about Moretti.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.502
I'd say, it's not me.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:43.807
I'm just some guy
moving numbers around

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.610
on a computer
in a fucking basement.

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:53.049
But I knew what was happening.

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:56.686
And I'm...
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:02.359
Um...

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:05.895
The paper that had
our names on it.

01:11:05.929 --> 01:11:06.930
You know, with the addresses?

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:09.065
That's my mom's address.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.734
Hey, don't worry about it.

01:11:10.767 --> 01:11:13.236
Could you go to that address,
go see her for me?

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:17.341
Me?

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:18.875
Yeah, just go see her, please.

01:11:20.544 --> 01:11:22.479
Tell her I did something,
you know,

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.615
that was good.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:27.451
Just tell her I did
something good.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:31.154
I don't know,
make some shit up, whatever.

01:11:33.557 --> 01:11:37.093
Just, it would mean
a lot to her.

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:40.630
Please.

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:45.669
Yeah. All right,
I'll tell her.

01:11:46.403 --> 01:11:47.404
Okay.

01:11:48.405 --> 01:11:49.573
Okay.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:58.982
I did the right thing.

01:12:13.697 --> 01:12:14.931
(LINE RINGING)

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:20.303
-US Marshals.
-Janine, it's Madolyn.

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.939
I need you to put me
through to Caroline Van Sant.

01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.509
Oh. Um... Uh...

01:12:25.542 --> 01:12:27.844
-Janine?
-Yes, one... one moment.

01:12:28.745 --> 01:12:30.113
(LINE RINGING)

01:12:30.146 --> 01:12:32.048
Harris, Coleridge here.

01:12:33.216 --> 01:12:34.584
Coleridge.

01:12:34.618 --> 01:12:35.819
I'll take it
from here, Janine.

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:37.554
Thank you.

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.457
Look, I'm afraid it looks
like you were right

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.492
about Deputy
Van Sant, Madolyn.

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:45.261
There was a car crash

01:12:45.294 --> 01:12:48.031
and she was T-boned
leaving the office.

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:50.667
Madolyn...

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.670
She's dead.

01:12:54.571 --> 01:12:55.672
Oh. (SOBS)

01:12:58.475 --> 01:13:00.444
I'm so very sorry, Madolyn.

01:13:00.477 --> 01:13:02.278
Fuck!

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:04.948
Well, I know
the other driver fled.

01:13:04.981 --> 01:13:06.550
One of Moretti's,
I'm guessing.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:07.984
I'm headed over there
right now.

01:13:08.017 --> 01:13:09.553
-Are you?
-Yeah.

01:13:09.586 --> 01:13:13.623
They must've been waiting
or I don't know.

01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:16.493
Whatever I could do,
however I can help, please.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:18.528
I know the two of you
were very close.

01:13:18.562 --> 01:13:20.664
-No wonder you're in charge.
-What did you say?

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:22.866
You got this all wrapped up,
haven't you?

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:25.134
You got this all figured out.

01:13:25.168 --> 01:13:26.470
Excuse me?

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:28.171
I know it was you.

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:30.206
I'm not sure where you're
going with this, Madolyn.

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:32.408
25 grand a month?

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:34.143
Check your records.
You got sloppy.

01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:36.480
Oh, you wanna compare records,
Deputy Harris?

01:13:36.513 --> 01:13:38.648
No one is gonna believe
a word you say.

01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:39.816
A jury will.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.818
-Careful, Harris.
-Careful?

01:13:41.851 --> 01:13:43.487
-Be very careful, Harris.
-Careful?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.354
You think I got
something to lose?

01:13:45.388 --> 01:13:46.756
God damn it!
You're going fucking crazy.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.357
Fuck you! Careful.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:50.527
-Listen to me.
-You be fucking careful.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.562
Deputy, talk to me,
god damn it.

01:13:52.596 --> 01:13:54.063
-Calm down, Harris.
- (PHONE RINGING)

01:13:54.097 --> 01:13:56.533
My pilot's calling. Fuck you.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.201
I'll see you in New York.

01:13:59.402 --> 01:14:00.537
Hassan.

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.338
Guess who we've got on radar.

01:14:02.371 --> 01:14:03.707
Thank God.

01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:06.009
You're 11 miles out
and looking good, Deputy.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.176
Good.

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:08.411
Hey, do me a favor.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:09.679
Hang up,
put your headphones on,

01:14:09.713 --> 01:14:12.949
and turn your radio
to frequency 121.5.

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:14.818
Okay. Okay.

01:14:19.989 --> 01:14:21.591
Okay, hear me?

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:22.959
Handsome, confident,

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:25.595
ATC controller looking
for an intrepid pilot.

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:26.896
Handsome, huh?

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.832
Land the damn plane
and see for yourself.

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:32.168
All right, Deputy,
let's bring it in.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.103
Okay.

01:14:39.576 --> 01:14:40.677
Winston.

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:42.278
Hey, hey, Winston.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.583
-Almost there.
-Good.

01:14:51.354 --> 01:14:53.122
You!

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:55.592
Stupid.
Why didn't you kill me?

01:14:57.193 --> 01:14:59.128
Hey! Why didn't
you just kill me?

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:00.664
Because I'm not like you.

01:15:00.697 --> 01:15:03.032
(CHUCKLES) Oh, yeah?

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:04.634
I'm gonna tear you apart

01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:07.604
into tiny little
fucking pieces.

01:15:07.637 --> 01:15:08.838
They're gonna need
the entire forensics team

01:15:08.872 --> 01:15:09.939
to identify you.

01:15:11.374 --> 01:15:13.743
Oh, I'm gonna enjoy it too.

01:15:13.777 --> 01:15:15.211
-I might be high, but...
-(JET ENGINE RUMBLING)

01:15:18.514 --> 01:15:19.549
Is that another plane?

01:15:30.393 --> 01:15:32.195
Hassan.

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.764
There's a plane tailing us.
Looks military.

01:15:34.798 --> 01:15:36.933
Yes, solid copy.
It's one of ours.

01:15:36.966 --> 01:15:38.134
They're going
to keep you company

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.703
the rest of the way.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:41.370
It's a little protection.

01:15:42.238 --> 01:15:43.472
That's good.

01:15:45.141 --> 01:15:46.242
Protection?

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:48.678
What? You think...

01:15:48.712 --> 01:15:49.879
You think it's there to help?

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:52.015
(DARYL LAUGHS)

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:55.384
How exactly is it
supposed to do that?

01:15:55.418 --> 01:15:57.721
It's there to protect
everyone else from you.

01:15:57.754 --> 01:15:59.055
In case you veer off course

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:00.489
and crash into
a school or something.

01:16:00.523 --> 01:16:03.059
-It's there to shoot you down.
-You're full of shit.

01:16:03.092 --> 01:16:04.894
(LAUGHS)

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:06.395
Who would you
rather lose, huh?

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:08.397
The three of us?

01:16:08.431 --> 01:16:09.999
Or a bunch of kiddies
playing patty cake

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:11.234
in a schoolyard playground?

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.501
Hell, Twig.

01:16:12.535 --> 01:16:14.638
Ain't you some kind of
accountant or something?

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:15.972
Do the math, you dumb fuck.

01:16:16.005 --> 01:16:18.074
He's full of shit. Right?

01:16:18.107 --> 01:16:20.176
It's not gonna happen.

01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.210
We're going to land
this thing.

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:26.015
Don't worry.
I'm gonna land the plane.

01:16:27.751 --> 01:16:29.085
(STRAINED GRUNTING)

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.855
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:34.724
Hey, I see it.
Hassan, I see the runway.

01:16:34.758 --> 01:16:36.660
Solid copy.
Got visual on my end.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:37.927
Flight path is good.

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:42.632
Okay. Passing 1,500 feet.
Air speed's at 90 knots.

-Hassan?
-Yeah, I'm here.

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.205
Deputy, there's a crosswind
that kicked up.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.407
I recommend
we try a practice run.

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.412
Winston.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:58.247
Winston.

01:16:58.281 --> 01:16:59.916
Your chances of
a successful landing

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.450
improve with a practice run.

01:17:01.484 --> 01:17:04.120
He's not gonna make it.
I barely feel a pulse.

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:05.421
-Still...
-We gotta land now.

01:17:07.791 --> 01:17:08.892
I'm just trying
to bring you home,

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:10.626
but you're the pilot
in command.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:12.328
It's your call.

01:17:14.397 --> 01:17:16.933
There's no time.
I'm not losing him.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:19.302
I'm landing this plane.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:24.207
I'm gonna enjoy this.
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:25.909
Okay. You are clear to land.

01:17:25.942 --> 01:17:27.043
Line up your nose
with the spot

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:28.277
on the near edge of the runway

01:17:28.311 --> 01:17:30.413
and cut your throttle
back to 25%.

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:35.451
Throttle to 25.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:36.953
I'm gonna enjoy this.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:48.331
Deputy, altitude.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:52.435
Altitude's at, uh, 1,000 feet.

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:54.003
-Flaps to full.
-Flaps.

01:17:55.271 --> 01:17:57.440
I don't... I don't see flaps.

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:58.708
(GROANING)

01:18:03.646 --> 01:18:05.114
Hassan, where are the flaps?

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:06.916
It's there. A round gray lever

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:08.852
just to the right
of the throttle.

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:11.888
Got it. Flaps to full.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.792

(HEAVY BREATHING)

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.135
All right, Winston.
We're almost there.

01:18:28.071 --> 01:18:29.806
Get off me!

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:31.808
Deputy, okay, even out.
You're drifting.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:34.610
I ain't going to no prison.
You hear me?

01:18:34.643 --> 01:18:37.646
Deputy, you copy?
You're drifting off course.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:38.815
You need to even out.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.350
(GROANS)

01:18:43.186 --> 01:18:45.354
What the hell
is going on up there?

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:46.823
Are those gunshots?

01:18:48.324 --> 01:18:49.926
Deputy! Deputy!

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:54.030
Deputy Harris,
are you still up?

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:57.166
-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
-Oh, thank God.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.202
Okay, okay.
You're doing great.

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:01.004
-Now back to business.
-Oh, shit.

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:03.572
The engine just died.
Hassan, the engine.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.174
That is because
you are out of fuel.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.210
That's a good thing.
You are less flammable.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.412
Oh. Oh, that's a relief.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:11.747
Besides, you don't need
the engine to land.

01:19:11.781 --> 01:19:14.250
-It's probably easier without.
-Oh, fuck.

01:19:14.283 --> 01:19:16.419
Just keep it steady.
We are nearly there.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:17.520
Okay.

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:20.056
Deputy, still good?

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:23.426
Yeah. Yeah. Passing 600 feet.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.362
This crosswind is
knocking you off course.

01:19:26.395 --> 01:19:29.165
Step on the right rudder pedal
until you straighten out.

01:19:29.198 --> 01:19:31.667
-You mean the left?
-No, it's the opposite.

01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:32.768
Oh, my God.

01:19:34.037 --> 01:19:36.605
Okay, better! Hold that line.

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.375
-All right.
-500 feet.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.879
Oh.

Pull back
on the yoke slightly.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:45.949
Okay.

01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.923
100 feet. You got this.
Good luck.

Wait, that's it?

01:19:55.124 --> 01:19:56.292
I'll see you on the ground.

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:58.561
We got a date.
I'll pick you up at 6:05.

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:02.065
20 feet. 10 feet.

01:20:02.598 --> 01:20:03.599
