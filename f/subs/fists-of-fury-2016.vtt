02:16.930 --> 02:18.014
I'm late.

02:23.937 --> 02:26.105
Mr. Chen, you've returned.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.567
Where are the others?

02:29.651 --> 02:31.569
They've all gone to the funeral.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.114
Give me an umbrella.

03:48.354 --> 03:52.275
Master. Master!

03:55.236 --> 03:58.823
- Master! Master!
- Chen Zhen!

04:00.909 --> 04:02.744
Master's beyond hearing.

04:03.328 --> 04:04.412
Master.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.206
Chen Zhen! Chen Zhen!

04:07.290 --> 04:08.416
Master...

04:13.254 --> 04:16.382
What's the matter with you?

04:23.056 --> 04:25.808
- Take him back for a rest.
- Yes, sir.

Have some porridge.

06:32.518 --> 06:34.771
You haven't eaten for two days.

06:35.855 --> 06:40.068
Master is dead. I know you're in pain.

06:41.444 --> 06:46.908
But it hurts me to see you like this.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.541
Please, eat something.

07:30.409 --> 07:31.911
He still refuses to eat?

07:32.954 --> 07:34.705
Elder brother, talk to him.

07:40.753 --> 07:43.923
Why won't you eat? It's for your health.

07:44.590 --> 07:49.303
We are all saddened by Master's death,
but the dead cannot be restored to life.

07:50.096 --> 07:51.514
You must see that.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.060
Can stomach pains kill a man?

07:57.353 --> 08:00.857
He had stomach pains
and then caught cold.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.111
Can a cold kill a man?

08:12.201 --> 08:13.703
Answer me!

08:14.620 --> 08:16.330
How exactly did he die?

08:18.082 --> 08:22.211
That's what the doctor said.
He died from a stomach flu.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.547
I don't believe it.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.550
He was in perfect health.

08:28.467 --> 08:32.263
How could he die?
Something must have happened!

08:32.346 --> 08:33.681
Brother.

08:37.852 --> 08:39.437
Calm yourself.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.231
We've all been thinking the same thing,

08:42.982 --> 08:46.402
but in Master's name, we mustn't be rash.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.154
We're investigating secretly.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.031
I must find out the truth.

08:50.114 --> 08:52.992
Of course you will,

08:53.075 --> 08:55.453
but this is our duty too.

08:55.536 --> 08:59.165
Tomorrow's the seventh day after
Master's death. Many guests will arrive.

08:59.790 --> 09:03.628
You must cheer yourself.
You're in need of rest.

09:03.711 --> 09:08.090
Huo Yuanjia was our great master.

09:08.174 --> 09:14.055
His many chivalrous acts in life
are known to all.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.559
I knew him for 30 years.

09:19.435 --> 09:25.983
I revere him for the spirit in which
he founded the Jing Wu School.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.571
After this hard work,

09:31.572 --> 09:33.324
he traveled all over the country,

09:34.200 --> 09:39.622
expending all his resources,
all his energy.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.416
He even sacrificed his life.

09:43.167 --> 09:46.003
I remember what he often said

09:46.837 --> 09:50.216
about his goal in founding
the Jing Wu School.

09:51.968 --> 09:57.098
People should learn martial arts
for fitness of mind and body.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.184
Not for conflict and fighting.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.771
He was against conflict between schools.

10:03.854 --> 10:09.443
He hoped all of us would be of one heart,

10:10.319 --> 10:12.780
for us to be strong and love the country.

10:13.948 --> 10:20.204
We must remember
the words of our Master Huo.

10:21.372 --> 10:26.043
Always remember his teachings
and pursue the martial arts accordingly

10:26.669 --> 10:31.841
so that every Chinese person
will stand strong, be fit in body,

10:32.258 --> 10:34.719
serve the community,

10:34.802 --> 10:36.679
win honor for the country,

10:38.014 --> 10:41.434
and seek the happiness
of future generations.

10:43.394 --> 10:46.355
Now, the Jing Wu School
has achieved much.

10:47.440 --> 10:50.776
Unfortunately, he has left us.

10:51.986 --> 10:55.197
He contributed so much to martial arts,

10:56.115 --> 10:59.910
all of his noble accomplishments.

10:59.994 --> 11:02.496
We are all saddened at his death.

11:03.289 --> 11:06.375
Let us pay our respects to Master Huo.

11:06.459 --> 11:09.086
We will now have three minutes' silence.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.511
Please sign in.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.556
I see we've arrived just in time.

11:22.183 --> 11:24.935
- You're —
- I'm Mr. Wu,

11:25.353 --> 11:28.898
the interpreter for Director Suzuki
at Hong Kou School.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.275
The director is busy,
but I've brought something for you.

11:31.359 --> 11:32.360
Yes, sir.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.167
What is the motive of your visit?

11:48.250 --> 11:51.921
Director Suzuki asked me
to send you something.

12:02.973 --> 12:04.558
"The sick man of East Asia."

12:06.977 --> 12:09.605
- What's the meaning of this?
- What's its meaning?

12:10.606 --> 12:15.236
It's very simple.
We know you're all gathered here.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.364
This title is a gift to you
from our director.

12:21.617 --> 12:24.036
Aren't you Chinese?

12:25.287 --> 12:29.083
Yes, but I'm different from you.

12:33.671 --> 12:37.550
Don't be upset.
I wouldn't be here if I were scared.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.719
I know all of you here
practice martial arts.

12:41.137 --> 12:43.681
And I've come precisely to challenge you.

12:44.807 --> 12:48.060
Well, who'll step up?

12:50.396 --> 12:51.397
Jia-qi.

13:08.873 --> 13:10.624
Step back!

13:10.708 --> 13:13.252
My Japanese friends here
are eager for a challenge.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.380
Who will satisfy them?

13:22.344 --> 13:25.848
You have trained hard,

13:25.931 --> 13:29.560
but now you dare not speak out.

13:37.318 --> 13:39.737
What's become of your courage?

13:54.293 --> 13:55.503
Don't fight!

13:58.672 --> 13:59.840
Now, sir...

13:59.924 --> 14:03.135
It's Mr. Wu.
You may call me Interpreter Wu.

14:05.346 --> 14:07.056
Mr. Wu,

14:07.139 --> 14:11.393
our master's teaching
was to train for physical fitness,

14:11.477 --> 14:13.229
not for fighting with others.

14:13.312 --> 14:16.732
The Jing Wu School
does not intend to fight with you.

14:18.817 --> 14:22.696
Is that so?
Then you concede defeat.

14:25.783 --> 14:30.246
If anyone can defeat me,
I'll eat those words.

14:31.080 --> 14:35.209
My Japanese friends say
that if anyone can defeat them,

14:35.292 --> 14:39.588
they'll eat the words
"Sick man of East Asia."

14:40.422 --> 14:43.050
Well, anyone dare to try?

14:44.635 --> 14:49.682
If the Jing Wu School won't fight,
how about the other schools?

14:50.432 --> 14:52.184
Well...

14:53.185 --> 14:55.062
it seems you were eager to try.

14:56.146 --> 14:58.774
Don't fool yourself, boy.

14:59.191 --> 15:03.821
You're all useless sick men of Asia.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.364
Chen Zhen.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.536
Stay calm.

15:14.206 --> 15:19.295
Why won't you speak up?
Fight back, if you've got the nerve.

15:22.798 --> 15:26.510
Listen, you can attack us all together.

15:26.594 --> 15:29.346
If you wish to challenge us,
we await your message.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.223
Let's go.

15:42.318 --> 15:46.071
This is too much, too much!
He's provoking us.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.534
Why won't you let us fight?

15:51.660 --> 15:53.746
I wanted to fight too.

15:55.748 --> 15:59.168
But Master taught us
not to seek out conflict.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.096
KITO-RYU JUJUTSU

16:44.546 --> 16:46.632
Who are you looking for?

16:49.468 --> 16:52.388
Suzuki, your director.

16:55.641 --> 16:58.894
He's not here. What do you want?

17:01.230 --> 17:03.440
I have something to return to him.

17:12.116 --> 17:13.659
SICK MAN OF EAST ASIA

17:25.087 --> 17:28.464
Very good. You're no coward.

17:29.466 --> 17:32.803
I'm the worst student
of the Jing Wu School.

17:39.518 --> 17:43.105
I'd like a taste
of your Japanese martial arts.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.497
You must be tired of living!

18:01.331 --> 18:03.834
You'll learn your lesson today.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.754
Very well. One on one?

18:09.173 --> 18:10.591
Or all of you together?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.718
One will be enough.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.567
I'll take him!

19:01.600 --> 19:02.601
Surround him!

21:56.358 --> 21:57.818
Hold it!

24:16.623 --> 24:23.296
We Chinese aren't the sick men.

25:15.182 --> 25:16.266
Eat it.

25:21.605 --> 25:23.899
You'll eat the paper this time.

25:24.983 --> 25:27.944
Next time, I'll make you eat the glass.

25:52.427 --> 25:53.845
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

25:57.807 --> 25:59.309
Where are you from?

26:04.981 --> 26:06.399
We're here.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.175
The scoundrel!

26:32.259 --> 26:35.762
The Jing Wu School
would dare to come here!

26:46.731 --> 26:48.316
What's his name?

26:51.444 --> 26:53.655
Director, I know him.

26:53.738 --> 26:57.575
He's Chen Zhen, Huo's favorite student.

27:00.829 --> 27:02.455
Let me ask you.

27:02.539 --> 27:05.959
Do you think that we Budoka
of Imperial Japan can be bullied?

27:06.793 --> 27:09.879
We Budoka of Imperial Japan
cannot be bullied.

27:09.963 --> 27:14.092
Very true.
The Budoka are the world's best.

27:15.510 --> 27:16.886
You've said it yourself.

27:18.346 --> 27:19.848
What are you going to do about it?

27:19.931 --> 27:21.266
We will take revenge!

27:21.349 --> 27:24.060
Right, revenge! Revenge.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.979
Revenge it must be.

27:26.062 --> 27:27.063
Very well.

27:31.318 --> 27:35.155
Destroy the Jing Wu School at once!
And don't come back if you fail.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.324
- Understood?
- Yes!

27:37.407 --> 27:38.408
Go.

28:11.900 --> 28:13.401
What do you want?

28:14.152 --> 28:17.113
- To go in and take a look.
- No, you can't go in.

28:30.418 --> 28:31.836
What about that dog?

28:33.171 --> 28:35.215
It belongs to a foreigner.

28:44.140 --> 28:46.267
Peasant, come here!

28:53.316 --> 28:57.529
You still want to go play in there?

28:59.197 --> 29:02.826
Just lie down
and act like a Japanese dog

29:02.909 --> 29:04.494
and I'll take you in to play.

29:41.656 --> 29:43.324
Hurry, the police are coming!

30:35.001 --> 30:36.544
What do you want?

31:17.085 --> 31:18.711
You attacked without warning.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.846
What's the matter?

31:30.390 --> 31:32.100
Why all the rough treatment?

31:38.106 --> 31:39.607
Tear it all apart!

32:57.560 --> 32:59.145
Don't fight! Stop fighting!

33:19.207 --> 33:21.125
Don't insult our master!

33:41.270 --> 33:42.271
Stop!

33:44.774 --> 33:46.776
Right, that's enough.

33:48.236 --> 33:50.947
Let's go. Get back.

33:52.323 --> 33:55.993
Let this serve as a little warning.

33:56.077 --> 33:59.205
Surrender Chen Zhen in three days.

33:59.288 --> 34:04.460
Otherwise, we'll have you shut down
and you'll all be arrested.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.838
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

34:23.521 --> 34:24.897
Brother. Brother!

34:24.981 --> 34:26.399
Come and help!

34:37.994 --> 34:41.831
Master, if you were alive...

34:43.416 --> 34:45.418
we wouldn't be bullied like this.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.432
He wants us to surrender Chen Zhen.

34:59.515 --> 35:02.143
His impulsiveness
has gotten us into trouble.

35:03.144 --> 35:07.231
Don't blame him.
Let's ask him after he's back.

35:07.899 --> 35:09.525
He's back.

35:16.616 --> 35:18.242
- He's back.
- Elder brother.

35:19.994 --> 35:21.621
You've gotten us into trouble.

35:21.704 --> 35:24.916
Where have you been all day?

35:26.167 --> 35:28.503
Did you go to Hong Kou School?

35:31.005 --> 35:34.425
You thought you would be a hero,

35:34.509 --> 35:36.719
but look what's happened to us.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.638
Why didn't you tell us?

35:45.645 --> 35:46.854
Answer me this.

35:46.938 --> 35:50.942
The mission of our school is to encourage
strength and love of country, correct?

35:53.027 --> 35:54.904
Is it to fight and make trouble?

35:56.823 --> 35:59.283
Then why didn't you tell us?

35:59.784 --> 36:02.829
Many Japanese came just now.
That's how they beat us.

36:02.912 --> 36:06.207
They demanded we surrender you
in three days. What shall we do?

36:07.250 --> 36:09.335
Let him resolve his troubles by himself.

36:09.418 --> 36:11.546
How can you say that?

36:11.629 --> 36:14.215
Then what should we do,
wait to be shut down?

36:14.298 --> 36:16.425
Not only that, we'll all be arrested.

36:17.677 --> 36:19.679
Master, think it over.

36:19.762 --> 36:23.432
We must not turn him in,
and we must protect ourselves as well.

36:26.853 --> 36:28.312
No, we can't turn him in.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.066
If we turn him in, he'll be killed.

36:32.483 --> 36:34.735
There's only one way.

36:34.819 --> 36:36.404
He must leave Shanghai.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.949
Right, you must leave Shanghai.

36:40.366 --> 36:42.869
- I'm not going.
- Why not?

36:42.952 --> 36:44.787
I don't want to leave you to face trouble.

36:46.622 --> 36:50.835
We all understand you mean well,
but you must think of yourself too.

36:51.627 --> 36:52.837
Please go.

36:53.671 --> 36:54.589
I'm not leaving.

36:55.214 --> 36:56.215
It's better you go.

36:56.299 --> 37:02.138
As long as they can't find you,
even though pressured by the Japanese,

37:02.221 --> 37:05.141
they will not take action without proof.

37:06.142 --> 37:08.394
I take back what I said in anger.

37:08.477 --> 37:11.689
We're all brothers. I can't let you die.

37:34.837 --> 37:39.133
You don't want to leave now
because you want to be a hero.

37:41.093 --> 37:43.262
None of us are afraid of trouble.

37:43.346 --> 37:44.764
Why don't you listen to our advice?

37:49.894 --> 37:53.439
Brother, leave quickly.
We won't blame you.

37:53.522 --> 37:56.484
Yes, brother, do so.
We won't blame you.

38:00.404 --> 38:05.326
Have you forgotten
what Master always taught?

38:07.912 --> 38:11.040
Master founded our school for a purpose.

38:11.123 --> 38:14.001
Now that he has passed away,
our burden is heavier.

38:14.835 --> 38:17.880
Do not think only of yourself,
think of the school.

38:17.964 --> 38:20.132
Why make a needless sacrifice?

38:21.634 --> 38:24.303
As your elder, I order you to go.

38:27.682 --> 38:28.975
Brother.

38:29.058 --> 38:31.477
Buy him a ticket
for the first train tomorrow.

39:22.278 --> 39:24.196
It's late. You'd better sleep.

39:25.948 --> 39:27.616
- Is everything packed?
- Yes.

39:34.874 --> 39:38.294
I came back this time
planning to marry you.

39:41.672 --> 39:43.632
How did it come to this?

39:44.675 --> 39:46.677
Marriage is not of concern now.

39:47.094 --> 39:50.765
In the future,
we can return to Shanghai one day.

39:50.848 --> 39:52.600
And we will live fully.

39:55.061 --> 39:57.813
My brothers suffer because of me.

39:58.814 --> 40:01.275
Do not think that way.
No one blames you.

40:02.359 --> 40:05.905
You'll leave on the first train.
Get some sleep.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.158
For this one final night,

40:11.077 --> 40:12.703
I must stay with Master.

40:35.059 --> 40:36.852
You get some sleep first.

42:15.284 --> 42:17.119
Did anyone see you?

42:17.203 --> 42:18.704
No, they're all asleep.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.331
Got it?

42:20.414 --> 42:23.500
Yes, Mr. Wu told us to get away.

42:23.584 --> 42:28.297
If they find out Huo died from this,
we'll be in deep trouble.

42:29.131 --> 42:31.258
Why does Mr. Wu want us to leave?

42:31.342 --> 42:33.093
He said the job's done.

42:33.177 --> 42:37.181
There's no point in staying.
What should we do now?

42:43.270 --> 42:45.189
You said you're returning home tomorrow.

42:45.272 --> 42:48.776
I'll resign and we'll go together.

42:48.859 --> 42:49.860
Yes.

42:57.534 --> 42:58.535
You're Japanese?

42:59.036 --> 43:00.162
Yes.

43:00.621 --> 43:04.166
I came to kill Huo Yuanjia.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.252
How could you say those words?

43:06.335 --> 43:09.838
Why not?
I do not fear your Fist of Fury.

43:10.589 --> 43:13.634
I know you're Huo's favorite student.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.303
I must test your kung fu.

44:04.268 --> 44:08.564
Steward Feng, come out here.

44:14.611 --> 44:16.030
Steward Feng.

44:19.116 --> 44:20.743
Come out here!

44:57.488 --> 44:59.448
Why did you kill Master?

45:00.532 --> 45:02.618
Why did you kill Master?

45:06.163 --> 45:08.248
Why did you kill Master?

45:49.081 --> 45:51.417
MASTER WAS KILLED BY POISON
IN THE BISCUITS

45:51.500 --> 45:53.794
I WILL FIND THE KILLER
AND TAKE REVENGE

46:03.220 --> 46:05.889
Brother! Brother!

46:12.438 --> 46:14.398
Brother! Brother!

46:15.357 --> 46:17.067
Hurry up!

46:26.952 --> 46:28.704
Where is elder brother?

46:28.787 --> 46:31.206
It's awful.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.710
I just saw two men hung up
on a lamppost.

46:34.793 --> 46:38.797
I saw it myself, it's terrible.
They're right outside.

46:39.882 --> 46:41.091
What is it?

46:41.175 --> 46:44.970
I went to buy the train ticket.
I saw two men hung up on a lamppost.

46:45.053 --> 46:48.182
They are the steward, Feng,
and the cook, Tien.

46:50.726 --> 46:53.103
Brother, are you sure?

46:53.187 --> 46:54.771
Yes, I am sure.

46:54.855 --> 46:57.900
There's absolutely no mistake about it.

47:01.111 --> 47:02.696
Let's go and have a look.

47:05.365 --> 47:07.201
What's happening?

47:07.284 --> 47:10.120
Feng and Tien have come to misfortune.
We're going to see.

47:35.687 --> 47:37.189
It is Feng, the steward!

47:48.116 --> 47:51.203
- Is it —
- Let's return and discuss this.

47:52.079 --> 47:53.121
Come.

47:57.209 --> 47:59.461
- Call an ambulance.
- Yes.

48:00.462 --> 48:04.258
The two men's faces were awful.
Seems like they'd been in a fight.

48:05.467 --> 48:07.052
Who could have done it?

48:07.844 --> 48:09.930
Will the Jing Wu School be implicated?

48:10.931 --> 48:13.559
I don't think so.
We don't even know who did it.

48:14.977 --> 48:18.397
It's hard to say.
But they were part of the school.

48:18.480 --> 48:21.984
What does that matter?
It's not as if we killed them.

48:22.067 --> 48:25.487
We'll surely have trouble
from the foreign concessions.

48:25.571 --> 48:29.116
The main thing is for us
to find out who did it.

48:32.160 --> 48:35.872
Chen Zhen did it.

48:36.456 --> 48:38.041
- Chen Zhen?
- Chen Zhen?

48:38.792 --> 48:43.380
He left me a note for me
saying Master died of poisoning.

48:44.756 --> 48:47.426
I wonder where he could have gone.

48:48.594 --> 48:51.054
Going into hiding doesn't help.

48:51.138 --> 48:55.225
He always does as he pleases.
Why didn't he tell us?

48:55.309 --> 48:57.269
We must find him.

48:58.312 --> 49:00.564
How can we find him? Shanghai is so big.

49:04.568 --> 49:06.903
He doesn't know Shanghai well.

49:07.404 --> 49:09.865
Organize a search.

49:10.365 --> 49:12.034
We must find him.

49:14.703 --> 49:19.041
We'll settle this when he returns.

49:35.223 --> 49:39.061
HERE LIES MASTER HUO YUANJIA

50:51.633 --> 50:52.634
Who's there?

51:00.434 --> 51:01.476
It's me!

51:12.237 --> 51:14.072
I knew you'd be here.

51:16.658 --> 51:19.286
Hiding is useless.

51:19.369 --> 51:21.371
Come back and talk with us.

51:22.581 --> 51:23.832
I won't go back.

51:26.293 --> 51:28.837
Nobody knows your role in this yet.

51:29.421 --> 51:31.339
Why hide and suffer?

51:32.674 --> 51:35.510
Let's go back and find a way.

51:40.557 --> 51:42.142
I'm not hiding.

51:45.896 --> 51:49.900
- And I don't want to get you involved.
- What are you going to do?

51:51.985 --> 51:53.737
I have my plans.

51:57.199 --> 51:58.450
It's all decided.

51:59.451 --> 52:01.953
Then what are your plans?

52:06.541 --> 52:08.460
Why won't you even tell me?

52:30.190 --> 52:32.359
We grew up together.

52:33.068 --> 52:36.613
We've always confided in one another.

52:37.906 --> 52:39.449
Why have you changed?

52:40.700 --> 52:42.118
I haven't changed.

52:44.329 --> 52:47.457
Then why won't you tell me?

52:48.959 --> 52:51.753
You must know how much I care for you.

53:00.470 --> 53:04.933
You may not believe me,
but I love you as much as always.

53:09.521 --> 53:10.730
I do believe you.

53:12.399 --> 53:14.234
Then don't ask what I will do.

53:38.133 --> 53:41.970
- Remember our dreams?
- Yes.

53:44.556 --> 53:46.766
We hoped to continue Master's work,

53:47.392 --> 53:49.853
to make Jing Wu School
respected all over the world...

53:51.396 --> 53:53.315
and to raise a happy family.

53:54.232 --> 53:58.820
Two children, a boy and a girl.

53:59.905 --> 54:05.827
Every day, you'd teach kung fu,
and I'd do the housework.

54:07.203 --> 54:12.626
I'd come to get you
and fetch the children from school.

54:13.627 --> 54:16.421
Could such a dream come true?

54:18.757 --> 54:20.175
I wish it could.

54:24.512 --> 54:28.892
If you haven't changed, this may happen.

54:29.726 --> 54:31.728
You mustn't think that way.

54:32.604 --> 54:34.564
Do you really love me so much?

54:34.648 --> 54:36.149
In addition to Master...

54:37.359 --> 54:39.569
it's you who means most to me.

54:51.206 --> 54:52.457
Is that true?

55:50.640 --> 55:53.935
Will you tell me your plans now?

56:10.035 --> 56:11.369
Why won't you speak?

56:14.497 --> 56:18.793
If you trust me,
I'll take you away somewhere.

56:19.419 --> 56:20.837
Where?

56:26.051 --> 56:28.762
To a place we love.

56:32.057 --> 56:34.100
A place where our dreams will come true.

56:45.320 --> 56:47.113
Do you know anyone called Wu?

56:48.948 --> 56:49.949
Wu?

56:51.409 --> 56:53.912
He's connected to Master's death.

56:55.872 --> 56:59.918
Wasn't that interpreter named Wu?
Could he be the one?

57:16.351 --> 57:17.352
Master.

57:20.605 --> 57:23.108
Something terrible has happened!

57:26.194 --> 57:27.195
Come in.

57:40.166 --> 57:41.251
What is it?

57:41.334 --> 57:43.503
Look at the newspapers.

57:43.586 --> 57:47.173
Mr. Yoshida's brother, Tien,
and Feng, the steward.

57:47.257 --> 57:49.384
They were both killed and strung up.

57:52.554 --> 57:54.806
I know. Sit down.

58:02.647 --> 58:03.606
Director,

58:03.690 --> 58:07.694
my brother became cook at Jing Wu School
to find out about the Fist of Fury.

58:09.028 --> 58:11.823
Now he's been mysteriously killed.

58:11.906 --> 58:13.533
You must avenge him, Director.

58:14.117 --> 58:17.537
This had to be done
by a member of the Jing Wu School.

58:17.620 --> 58:19.581
We'll kill them all!

58:19.664 --> 58:20.957
I'll assemble the men.

58:21.040 --> 58:22.417
Wait a moment.

58:23.001 --> 58:28.256
Director, if we do that,
it'll connect us to Huo's death.

58:29.340 --> 58:30.967
What do you mean?

58:31.050 --> 58:32.594
I have an idea.

58:33.386 --> 58:34.429
Then tell me.

58:35.513 --> 58:39.142
We'll pressure the police
to take action against the school.

58:44.772 --> 58:47.609
If they refuse to turn over Chen Zhen,

58:47.692 --> 58:51.529
they'll shut down the school
and arrest everyone!

58:52.488 --> 58:54.324
The Chinese are loyal to their friends.

58:54.407 --> 58:59.078
Chen Zhen won't let that happen.
He'll turn himself in.

58:59.162 --> 59:04.959
When we have Chen Zhen,
we can do whatever we want with him.

59:05.043 --> 59:07.962
He'll be completely helpless.

59:08.046 --> 59:11.299
Well, how does that sound?

59:12.800 --> 59:14.802
You truly are a good friend to Japan.

59:17.764 --> 59:20.600
I've always been loyal to the empire.

59:20.683 --> 59:24.938
And I will continue to be
till the day I die.

59:25.021 --> 59:28.274
- Very well. Act on your plan at once.
- Yes, sir!

59:33.655 --> 59:39.118
Out of respect for your master,
we've been quite lenient with you.

59:40.328 --> 59:44.415
But now you're causing trouble.
Why did you raid the Hong Kou School?

59:45.833 --> 59:47.460
We don't want to cause you any trouble.

59:47.543 --> 59:50.797
They came and beat us all up.
We didn't start anything.

59:52.465 --> 59:55.426
But you did provoke them, didn't you?

59:55.510 --> 59:58.137
They came here first.
They sent us this sign, and —

01:00:00.306 --> 01:00:05.979
How did the steward and the cook die?
Don't you have any idea?

01:00:07.105 --> 01:00:08.064
We don't know.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.525
Is that so?

01:00:11.818 --> 01:00:12.860
We don't know.

01:00:15.071 --> 01:00:17.240
You should know
this won't be that simple.

01:00:18.449 --> 01:00:21.244
The Japanese are influential here.

01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:25.123
You're asking for trouble.

01:00:25.957 --> 01:00:27.667
I've been quite lenient with you.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:30.503
But I have a duty to perform.
How can I ignore that?

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:36.884
Where is Chen Zhen?

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:41.681
He hasn't returned since he caused
trouble at Hong Kou School.

01:00:45.476 --> 01:00:47.145
You really don't know where he is?

01:00:48.271 --> 01:00:50.815
We really don't.
We're looking for him too.

01:00:51.691 --> 01:00:55.320
You shouldn't withhold information.

01:00:55.403 --> 01:00:56.612
I'm not a patient man.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:01:00.116
We really don't know.
We're looking for him too.

01:01:00.533 --> 01:01:03.328
We don't want to be mixed up in this.

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.751
The Japanese consulate
has demanded action.

01:01:10.543 --> 01:01:12.628
This is not a joke.

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:18.426
Turn him in within two days,
or I'll have to get tough.

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.178
Let's go.

01:03:32.268 --> 01:03:35.313
The Japanese empire is truly great!

01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:39.942
Even its dancing is superb.

01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:49.702
Don't worry. Leave things to me.

01:03:52.497 --> 01:03:55.708
Escaped? What happened?

01:03:56.792 --> 01:03:59.754
Mr. Petrov is head
of the Russian Hammers.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:03.049
He's a good fighter
and a friend of our director.

01:04:03.132 --> 01:04:06.427
He's had some trouble in Russia.
That's why he's here.

01:04:08.387 --> 01:04:09.805
Then you can rest assured.

01:04:09.889 --> 01:04:14.227
Under our director's wings,
you're completely safe.

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:20.191
Mr. Petrov, here's to you.

01:04:23.194 --> 01:04:25.154
Three cups?

01:04:25.238 --> 01:04:27.448
Very well, three cups.

01:04:47.635 --> 01:04:51.556
I've had a bit too much.
Please excuse me.

01:04:56.102 --> 01:04:57.186
Wait, come back!

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:58.813
Sit down.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:04.569
If you must go, then crawl out!
Crawl out like a dog.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:10.992
Crawl?

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:15.246
Would you like to?

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:19.834
Sure. I'll do whatever you ask.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.712
I'll crawl.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:34.265
Bye!

01:05:59.123 --> 01:06:00.416
Stand up!

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:05.796
Where to?

01:06:06.672 --> 01:06:08.883
North Szechuan Road and Yokohama Road.

01:07:06.524 --> 01:07:08.984
Stop! Where are we going?

01:07:09.068 --> 01:07:10.903
This is a dead end.

01:07:17.743 --> 01:07:19.286
What are you doing?

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:27.378
I just wanted to ask you something.

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.381
It's you!

01:07:36.345 --> 01:07:39.098
I want to ask you something.

01:07:39.682 --> 01:07:42.727
You needn't ask. I know nothing.

01:08:06.375 --> 01:08:09.962
I want to ask you something.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:15.301
I know what you want to ask,
but it wasn't me.

01:08:16.761 --> 01:08:20.723
I mean it was,
but someone else asked me to do it.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:30.441
Director Suzuki told me
to pass the poison to Feng the steward.

01:08:30.524 --> 01:08:34.819
Then Feng gave it to Tien, the cook.
He's Japanese.

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:43.662
Spare me. I'm just a dog.

01:08:43.746 --> 01:08:45.581
Please spare my life.

01:08:45.663 --> 01:08:47.666
Have mercy...

01:09:07.019 --> 01:09:08.020
Why do...

01:09:10.064 --> 01:09:12.149
Why do you push me?

01:09:21.783 --> 01:09:23.743
Look, another man's been hung there!

01:09:23.828 --> 01:09:25.371
Come and look!

01:09:39.969 --> 01:09:44.223
Chen Zhen dared to come
to our school and attack us.

01:09:45.057 --> 01:09:47.184
And now he's killed my interpreter.

01:09:47.268 --> 01:09:52.523
He scorns the Japanese empire.
This has become a lawless place.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:56.235
Are you not detectives?
What good are you?

01:09:58.279 --> 01:10:01.949
Director, surely you overstate things.

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:05.035
I asked them to turn over Chen Zhen
within two days.

01:10:05.119 --> 01:10:07.621
I know what to do if they don't.

01:10:08.455 --> 01:10:12.585
What can you do? You're Chinese.

01:10:12.668 --> 01:10:14.545
You Chinese protect each other.

01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:18.632
I don't care about nationality.

01:10:18.716 --> 01:10:22.469
The police have to be sensible.
We need to be impartial.

01:10:23.762 --> 01:10:25.806
This is not about being sensible.

01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:29.435
Chen Zhen is a killer.
You must bring him in.

01:10:32.271 --> 01:10:37.359
You can say that, Director,
but this is not our procedure.

01:10:37.943 --> 01:10:41.572
Mr. Wu was murdered,
but there's no proof.

01:10:41.655 --> 01:10:43.699
We can't say Chen Zhen did it.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:58.505
Proof or no proof,
you better bring him in!

01:10:59.173 --> 01:11:02.968
Otherwise, I'll report this
to the consulate!

01:11:07.139 --> 01:11:10.517
You're making this difficult for us.

01:11:11.143 --> 01:11:15.397
If you don't bring him in,
I'll handle this myself.

01:11:15.481 --> 01:11:17.900
I have my own ways.

01:11:23.072 --> 01:11:25.950
Very well, I'll do my best.

01:11:42.549 --> 01:11:46.804
They're useless.
We'd better use our own methods.

01:11:47.221 --> 01:11:49.473
We'll report this to the consulate first.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:52.101
- Be ready to arrest them.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:03.320
The paper.

01:12:04.071 --> 01:12:06.532
The Japanese will force me
to turn Chen Zhen over to them.

01:12:06.615 --> 01:12:08.701
How can I find him
in a big city like Shanghai?

01:12:08.784 --> 01:12:09.785
You're right.

01:12:11.036 --> 01:12:15.874
Forget it. Just one day at a time.
We'll go to the Jing Wu School.

01:12:53.912 --> 01:12:58.375
Things are getting worse.
He even killed the Japanese interpreter.

01:12:59.126 --> 01:13:02.671
He's making things difficult not only
for the Japanese, but for me too.

01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:06.050
I work for the authorities.
What would you do in my place?

01:13:06.133 --> 01:13:10.137
We really can't find him.
What are we to do?

01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:15.559
Everyone knows you're a just man.

01:13:16.143 --> 01:13:18.604
We wouldn't play tricks on you.

01:13:18.687 --> 01:13:20.689
We really don't know where he is.

01:13:20.773 --> 01:13:24.443
As we all know,
it's not like I don't look after you.

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:29.198
If you don't turn him over,
the Japanese will find him themselves.

01:13:29.281 --> 01:13:34.328
If they shut down your school
and arrest you all,

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.330
it will go very badly for you.

01:13:37.247 --> 01:13:40.501
Even if you arrest us now,
we still can't tell you anything

01:13:40.584 --> 01:13:42.669
because we really don't know anything.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.801
Very well.

01:13:50.761 --> 01:13:52.554
At least I've made things clear.

01:13:52.971 --> 01:13:56.308
There's one day left.
Please turn him in.

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:58.060
The Japanese
are in no mood for games.

01:13:58.143 --> 01:14:01.230
If I'm forced to arrest you,
then don't blame me.

01:14:02.064 --> 01:14:03.273
Let's go.

01:14:20.582 --> 01:14:24.545
It's really serious. What are we to do?

01:14:24.628 --> 01:14:26.630
Elder brother,
let's stop looking for Chen Zhen.

01:14:26.713 --> 01:14:28.465
If we find him,
we're sending him to his death.

01:14:28.549 --> 01:14:30.634
They won't dare hurt us.

01:14:31.885 --> 01:14:34.429
So many are suffering because of him.

01:14:34.513 --> 01:14:37.266
We'll go to jail if we must.
We must remain loyal to our friend.

01:14:37.349 --> 01:14:38.350
Elder brother!

01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:41.812
Please come upstairs.
I want to talk to you.

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:11.258
What is it?

01:15:14.052 --> 01:15:19.057
If they really can't find Chen Zhen,

01:15:19.141 --> 01:15:21.101
will it cause much trouble for our school?

01:15:21.185 --> 01:15:25.856
Yes. The Japanese
are influential in Shanghai.

01:15:26.982 --> 01:15:29.818
They very likely
will shut down the school.

01:15:30.527 --> 01:15:33.906
And if they found Chen Zhen?

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:37.534
He'll surely be killed.
We can't let them find him.

01:15:38.785 --> 01:15:40.996
Even though we don't know where he is,

01:15:41.079 --> 01:15:43.999
we must find him and ask him
to leave Shanghai at once.

01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:45.876
I...

01:15:49.922 --> 01:15:50.839
You what?

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.273
You know where he is?

01:16:18.325 --> 01:16:20.827
His life depends on it.

01:16:21.245 --> 01:16:23.747
If you know, tell me.

01:16:31.838 --> 01:16:33.632
I know where he stays at night.

01:16:34.466 --> 01:16:36.468
Where is he now?

01:16:54.027 --> 01:16:56.697
JAPANESE HONG KOU SCHOOL

01:17:19.845 --> 01:17:22.764
Is your phone out of order?
I'm from the telephone company.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.143
What took you so long?
I've sent for you so many times.

01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:29.730
I just got my orders and came at once.

01:17:31.315 --> 01:17:32.941
Okay, come with me.

01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:41.074
Over there.

01:20:39.461 --> 01:20:42.172
Don't just stand there. Hurry up!

01:20:58.897 --> 01:21:00.899
There's another one inside.

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:22.504
Wait here.

01:21:34.307 --> 01:21:36.893
The telephone repairman is here.

01:21:38.728 --> 01:21:41.898
- Director, here's the telephone repairman.
- Let him in.

01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:44.025
Tell him to come in.

01:21:44.109 --> 01:21:45.735
Come here.

01:21:59.207 --> 01:22:01.543
Director, it's the telephone repairman.

01:22:02.877 --> 01:22:03.962
Go on.

01:22:14.973 --> 01:22:19.936
I'm dying to find that Chen Zhen
and see just how skilled he is.

01:22:20.645 --> 01:22:26.192
It's not only his Fist of Fury.
He moves like lightning.

01:22:26.818 --> 01:22:31.573
We'll concentrate on the Jing Wu School.

01:22:32.407 --> 01:22:34.659
Wait, let's discuss this later.

01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:09.694
What do you suggest?

01:23:09.778 --> 01:23:12.906
Just wipe out everyone
from the Jing Wu School.

01:23:13.865 --> 01:23:15.909
What about the consequences?

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:18.703
We Japanese are powerful
in the concession area.

01:23:18.787 --> 01:23:23.500
As long as we leave no evidence,
they'll have no way to know it was us.

01:23:25.543 --> 01:23:30.006
Right. Ask someone
to do it cleanly tonight.

01:23:30.090 --> 01:23:31.299
Yes!

01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:43.561
Why isn't he here?

01:23:44.688 --> 01:23:46.356
Look around.

01:23:48.608 --> 01:23:50.694
- Chen Zhen!
- Chen Zhen!

01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:55.782
Chen Zhen!

01:24:01.121 --> 01:24:02.831
Where can he have gone?

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.335
Let's wait for him here.

01:24:09.629 --> 01:24:10.922
Where could he be?

01:24:12.173 --> 01:24:13.383
Where...

01:24:31.568 --> 01:24:34.612
Wonton noodles!

01:25:25.789 --> 01:25:28.583
I'm here to avenge my master.

01:25:31.628 --> 01:25:33.379
Ask your director to come out!

01:25:35.632 --> 01:25:37.217
This doesn't involve you.

01:25:41.554 --> 01:25:43.473
Get out! Get out!

01:25:44.599 --> 01:25:45.642
Beat it!

01:25:49.479 --> 01:25:50.605
Beat it!

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:55.360
Beat it!

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.161
Beat it!

01:28:45.738 --> 01:28:48.700
Hold it! Who are you?

01:28:50.034 --> 01:28:51.786
I'm Chen Zhen.

01:28:52.829 --> 01:28:53.997
I want the director.

01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.082
Chen Zhen?

01:36:58.105 --> 01:36:59.607
Sister...

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.446
Sister!

01:37:05.821 --> 01:37:07.531
Brother! Brother!

01:37:09.658 --> 01:37:11.410
What happened? Who did it?

01:37:11.952 --> 01:37:15.539
The Japanese.

01:37:16.081 --> 01:37:18.042
What about the others?
Did anyone escape?

01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:21.504
All...

01:37:25.424 --> 01:37:26.425
Brother?

01:37:54.453 --> 01:37:55.663
Yao-chang.

01:37:55.746 --> 01:37:57.456
He might pull through.

01:38:00.376 --> 01:38:04.004
Help anyone who's survived.
We'll go upstairs.

01:38:14.974 --> 01:38:16.976
See if anyone's still alive.

01:38:34.910 --> 01:38:38.455
Brother, there are no survivors.

01:39:12.406 --> 01:39:15.242
I'm not worthy of you, Master!

01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.704
I'm not worthy of you, Master!

01:39:22.333 --> 01:39:25.961
They died so horribly.

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:28.631
What are we going to do?

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:34.720
Our tolerance was a mistake.

01:39:36.639 --> 01:39:38.390
Chen Zhen was right.

01:39:40.976 --> 01:39:42.311
The Japanese.

01:39:43.562 --> 01:39:44.938
I'm from the consulate.

01:39:45.022 --> 01:39:49.860
How dare you Chinese attack the judo hall!
It's really too much!

01:39:49.943 --> 01:39:54.198
I don't want things to get out of hand.
I'll turn the man over to you.

01:39:55.074 --> 01:39:57.576
You're Chinese as well. I don't trust you.

01:39:57.660 --> 01:39:58.952
I must go in!

01:40:01.246 --> 01:40:04.249
Very well, just you.

01:40:06.168 --> 01:40:07.961
Keep guard here. Don't let anyone go in.

01:40:08.045 --> 01:40:09.254
Yes, sir!

01:40:33.028 --> 01:40:34.655
What happened?

01:40:35.656 --> 01:40:39.076
The Japanese did it.

01:40:39.159 --> 01:40:41.328
- The Japanese?
- Watch your tongue!

01:40:41.412 --> 01:40:46.083
You must not slander people.
What proof do you have?

01:40:48.085 --> 01:40:49.712
These two survivors.

01:40:50.254 --> 01:40:52.423
If I wasn't in charge of Jing Wu School,

01:40:52.881 --> 01:40:55.342
and if not for the fate of Jing Wu School,

01:40:55.426 --> 01:40:56.927
I'd fight you to the end!

01:40:57.511 --> 01:41:01.265
Stop talking.
Go ahead and file a complaint.

01:41:01.682 --> 01:41:05.644
I only want Chen Zhen, immediately.

01:41:10.023 --> 01:41:13.235
Chen Zhen killed many people
at Hong Kou School.

01:41:13.777 --> 01:41:16.488
The consulate has asked the police
to turn him over to them.

01:41:16.572 --> 01:41:18.907
You'll have to turn in Chen Zhen.

01:41:18.991 --> 01:41:20.075
What?

01:41:20.159 --> 01:41:22.411
They've killed so many of us,
yet they go free.

01:41:22.494 --> 01:41:26.665
And no one knows if Chen Zhen
was the killer at Hong Kou School.

01:41:27.249 --> 01:41:31.295
Now you want us to turn him in.
Is that fair?

01:41:37.217 --> 01:41:39.470
We're in no position to argue.

01:41:44.183 --> 01:41:48.729
Mr. Fan, you know the situation here.

01:41:49.146 --> 01:41:51.857
Chen Zhen must be turned in.

01:41:52.858 --> 01:41:55.986
I really don't know where he is.
You call the shots.

01:41:56.528 --> 01:41:59.615
Enough. Take them all away!

01:42:04.161 --> 01:42:06.580
You really don't know where he is?

01:42:47.579 --> 01:42:52.000
What if we can't find Chen Zhen?

01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:55.629
I've been lenient with you.

01:42:56.129 --> 01:42:58.715
Now I cannot help you any longer.

01:42:59.508 --> 01:43:01.426
You're taking us all in?

01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:06.265
Not only will you go to prison,
but the school will be shut down.

01:43:06.348 --> 01:43:08.517
Jing Wu students will no longer exist.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.561
Do you Japanese listen to reason?

01:43:10.644 --> 01:43:12.604
Is there no justice?

01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:15.148
I'm the law in the settlement.

01:43:15.232 --> 01:43:18.110
Don't blame me for arresting you.
Blame it on Chen Zhen.

01:43:18.527 --> 01:43:21.238
Who asked him to go into hiding?

01:43:23.031 --> 01:43:26.451
He should turn himself in
for your sake if he's a good man.

01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:33.083
Chen Zhen is here!

01:44:44.696 --> 01:44:48.867
I'm not an educated man.
Don't lie to me.

01:44:50.285 --> 01:44:52.537
If I turn myself in...

01:44:53.538 --> 01:44:56.208
The Jing Wu School will not be involved.

01:45:01.588 --> 01:45:02.589
Is that right?

01:45:08.053 --> 01:45:12.808
