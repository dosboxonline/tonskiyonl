<i>Meet Alana Fitzgerald.</i>

00:58.767 --> 01:00.894
<i>How she got here is quite a tale.</i>

01:00.894 --> 01:02.604
<i>And I'm here to tell it to you.</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:04.898
<i>I'll tell you all about Alana.</i>

01:04.898 --> 01:06.524
<i>And who am I?</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:09.319
<i>I'm Stewie, the talking baby
from</i> Family Guy.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.945
<i>Do you really not know that?</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:12.655
<i>And now to our tale.</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:15.742
<i>It started innocently enough
late last month.</i>

01:21.790 --> 01:23.750
Oh, Alana, this lesson has been a treat.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.752
You were always the best student.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.754
And you were always
the only teacher in town

01:27.754 --> 01:30.590
who didn't rest a hand
on my knee while I played.

01:30.590 --> 01:33.093
It's okay. I'm not a teacher.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.552
Chris, go to your room.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.597
Sure thing, Mom.
Just one more sniff of Finesse.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.022
As you were.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.566
Alana, it's been five years
since you graduated,

01:48.650 --> 01:50.485
and still no college plans?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.570
I still want to audition for Juilliard,

01:52.654 --> 01:55.949
but I still can't afford
the $1,200 application fee.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.784
Oh, you're not gonna tell me you can't pay

01:57.784 --> 01:59.619
the seven dollars for today's lesson?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.246
'Cause that's our sandwich money.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.957
Will there be sandwiches then, miss?

02:07.043 --> 02:08.837
Peter, can I talk to you about Alana?

02:08.837 --> 02:10.338
I have an idea.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.923
You can talk about anything you want,

02:11.923 --> 02:13.925
as long as you shout
it over the Patriots game.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.635
<i>Critical third and seven</i>

02:15.635 --> 02:17.971
<i>- for Mac Jones and the Patriots.</i>
- I just feel really bad for her.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.722
<i>- There's the snap,</i>
- You know, she's so talented, but she doesn't

02:19.806 --> 02:21.057
<i>- Jones drops back,</i>
- have the money to apply to colleges.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.351
<i>- and it's a fumble!</i>
- Oh, no.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.937
I know, it's sad.
And that's where I think we can help.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.273
<i>- Somehow Mac Jones fell on it.</i>
- Come on, the clock is ticking.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.441
Well, I just think we could hire her
to help around the house.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.318
<i>- Jones, still on his feet, and he scrambles</i>
- You know, with the laundry,

02:32.402 --> 02:34.237
<i>- into the end zone</i>
- driving the kids to school, all that stuff.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.780
<i>- for a touchdown!</i>
- Yes!

02:35.864 --> 02:38.366
Thank you, Peter. I knew you'd understand.

02:38.366 --> 02:41.202
Man, it just really sucks
when you're playing from behind.

02:41.286 --> 02:44.747
Exactly.
That's why I'm so happy to help her out.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.833
You know, I think
we'll both sleep better tonight.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.002
<i>And the Patriots set up on defense.</i>

02:49.002 --> 02:51.004
Go for the sack!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.590
Well, you did agree to the Alana thing.

02:53.590 --> 02:55.842
Hmm, where's my clothespin?

02:55.842 --> 02:58.761
<i>This gross encounter sealed the deal.</i>

02:58.845 --> 03:01.014
<i>And just like that, Alana was welcomed</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:02.974
<i>as a member of our family.</i>

03:05.518 --> 03:08.855
Oh, that must be Alana.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.107
What are you, the Amazing Kreskin?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
Just open the damn door.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.571
Ah! Welcome, Alana.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.573
Oh, thank you, Lois.

03:18.573 --> 03:20.658
Are you sure this is okay?

03:20.742 --> 03:22.744
Okay? It's wonderful.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.913
Come on, meet the rest of the family.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.789
Now, of course, you know Chris.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.791
Hi, Chris. Good to see you again.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.710
And it will be good to see you again

03:30.710 --> 03:32.670
through the bathroom keyhole.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.299
That was not original to the house.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.634
Hi. I'm Peter.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.928
I enjoy middle-of-the-night
hallway cereal.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.597
I'm Meg. Don't touch my drum set
or you're dead meat.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.934
<i>No one had ever heard
of Meg's drum set before this moment.</i>

03:45.934 --> 03:49.145
Oh, Lois, you're so lucky
to have such a beautiful family.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.897
I didn't grow up with any of this.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.649
Let me show you where you'll be staying,

03:52.649 --> 03:54.234
and you can get settled in.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.319
Oh, there's plenty of time for that.

03:56.319 --> 03:57.779
Let me get started on dinner.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.365
I was thinking tacos and nachos?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.991
Well, sounds good to me.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.368
What do you think, Peter?

04:03.368 --> 04:05.536
I just arrived in my pants.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.375
<i>That night, we all ate tacos and nachos</i>

04:10.375 --> 04:12.877
<i>that were so good we stood and cheered.</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:14.796
<i>We were the envy of the neighborhood.</i>

04:14.796 --> 04:16.381
Here, Joe.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.383
Barely-thawed trout and white rice.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.721
This trout's the lucky one.
It's over for him.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.224
- What's that, Joe?
- Thanks, Bon. Looks terrific.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.355
Did you guys know
you have a pool in the backyard?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.440
It was just overgrown
with grass and weeds.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.276
Cannonball!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.944
There's no water in it, though.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.946
Llabnonnac!

04:39.946 --> 04:41.739
Phew. That was a close one.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.325
You know, Alana, I confess I wasn't sure

04:44.409 --> 04:47.870
how this was gonna work out,
but you've been terrific.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.123
Uh, you're just too good to be true.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624
<i>Too good to be true.</i>

04:51.708 --> 04:53.710
<i>Like a single Jewish doctor.</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:56.087
<i>Hello? Where are you?</i>

04:56.087 --> 04:59.424
<i>Doctors can be girls, too, so shut up.</i>

04:59.424 --> 05:01.968
<i>Yes, everything seemed perfect
in our household,</i>

05:01.968 --> 05:04.846
<i>but sometimes things
aren't what they seem.</i>

05:04.846 --> 05:07.015
<i>We'd been so conditioned into believing</i>

05:07.015 --> 05:09.892
<i>our mother's life was empty,
we couldn't even fathom the idea</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:12.020
<i>that another person would want it.</i>

05:12.020 --> 05:14.439
<i>It was a real</i> All About Eve <i>moment.</i>

05:14.439 --> 05:18.359
<i>Or, if you're under 70,
a real</i> Single White Female <i>moment.</i>

05:18.443 --> 05:21.779
<i>Or, if you're under 50,
a real</i> Swimfan <i>moment.</i>

05:21.863 --> 05:24.449
<i>Or, if you're Black,
the Beyoncé movie</i> Obsessed,

05:24.449 --> 05:27.076
<i>which I haven't seen
but hear real good things about.</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:28.953
<i>Yes, Alana was a regular Lisa,</i>

05:29.037 --> 05:30.663
<i>which is the character from</i> Obsessed,

05:30.747 --> 05:32.248
<i>which I just looked up.</i>

05:32.332 --> 05:34.334
Stewie, eat your vegetables.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.587
<i>STEWIE Okay,
that's pretty good, but I'm onto you.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:52.685
Oh, 8:15.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.063
Well, that's much later
than I usually wake up,

05:55.063 --> 05:58.316
but at least I won't react
like a character in an '80s mov...

05:58.316 --> 06:00.485
8:15?!

06:16.751 --> 06:18.002
I am so sorry.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.879
I didn't realize how late it was.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.547
You guys must be starving.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.008
Wha... What's all this?

06:24.092 --> 06:25.760
Oh, good morning, Lois.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.303
I thought I'd let you sleep in.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.347
Oh, that's nice.

06:29.347 --> 06:31.432
- Where's Peter?
- Oh, he's here.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.559
He's just in the kid phase
of the Mini-Wheats cycle.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.354
The shrinking process
was incredibly painful.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.023
Mom, she made us eggs with falafel.

06:39.107 --> 06:42.026
Or, as she calls it, "falafel à la Alana."

06:42.110 --> 06:44.362
It's hard to say, but they're delicious.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.448
I take adult-sized poops,
but I have kid-sized parts.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.367
I could die from this.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.745
Yeah, that's-that's part of why
I don't let Peter do that.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.705
But you know what, I'm glad you guys

06:54.789 --> 06:56.457
are all enjoying Alana so much.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.084
Oh, she's the best.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.129
In fact, Alana and I
stayed up all night scissoring.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.631
Wow, Meg, you're really good at this.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.968
Yeah, I had an older babysitter
who kind of showed me how.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.803
Hey, maybe after this,

07:08.803 --> 07:10.430
we can get out the cribbage board

07:10.430 --> 07:11.931
and work on our pegging.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.808
<i>I'm Mayor Wild West,</i>

07:13.808 --> 07:16.811
<i>and my neighbor's kid
had to explain this to me.</i>

07:16.811 --> 07:20.773
<i>Guess this week
it's church on Sunday and Wednesday.</i>

07:20.857 --> 07:23.693
<i>But anyway, back to our tale.</i>

07:23.693 --> 07:25.945
<i>The dominoes were falling one by one.</i>

07:25.945 --> 07:29.657
<i>Especially Peter,
who found Alana to be a sheer delight.</i>

07:29.657 --> 07:31.534
<i>That will be more clear when you see</i>

07:31.534 --> 07:33.077
<i>how she's about to be dressed.</i>

07:33.161 --> 07:35.746
Santa?

07:35.830 --> 07:38.249
I can almost see your bum
through your nightgown.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.334
<i>Any time
Peter saw someone at 2:00 a.m.,</i>

07:40.418 --> 07:42.128
<i>he assumed it was Santa.</i>

07:42.128 --> 07:44.839
Alana? What are you doing up so nipples?

07:44.839 --> 07:48.134
Oh, sorry, I was just
cleaning out the freezer.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.760
Okay, any Popsicles that say

07:49.844 --> 07:51.721
"property of Peter Griffin" are mine.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.474
Got it. You see anything else you like?

07:54.474 --> 07:57.143
I can think of one or two things.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.813
Did you enjoy your five-course meal?

08:00.897 --> 08:03.191
I wouldn't consider an amuse-bouche

08:03.191 --> 08:05.151
a full course unto itself.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.195
I guess you're right.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.697
Hey, maybe we could
split a Popsicle for dessert.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.492
Yeah, sure, if any of them
have your name on 'em, help yourself.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.955
Hey, thanks for taking
me to the dog park, Lois.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.291
Well, now that we
have Alana, I've got more time

08:20.291 --> 08:22.210
to do stuff like this.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.339
Can I be honest with you, Brian?

08:26.339 --> 08:27.798
Hmm. That's what a woman says

08:27.882 --> 08:29.300
before she trashes another woman.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.677
I-I'm a little worried about Alana.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.181
I mean, the kids seem to like her

08:35.181 --> 08:36.849
and she's good at her job,

08:36.933 --> 08:39.268
but maybe a little too good, you know?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.020
I don't know, she seems cool to me.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.439
I mean, yes, I know, she's very sweet.

08:45.233 --> 08:48.402
But sometimes I feel like
maybe she's after something.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.363
I just don't know what it is.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.783
Well, maybe you're right.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.077
I'll tell you what, I'll talk to Alana

08:56.077 --> 08:58.162
and try to sniff out
what's going on with her.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.622
Oh, thanks, Brian.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.290
I'd appreciate that.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.167
I'll tell you,
I'm starting to wish I'd never...

09:03.251 --> 09:04.585
hired her!

09:07.338 --> 09:09.382
Hey, sorry about that.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.759
Well, looks like Lois is plenty threatened

09:11.759 --> 09:14.887
by that new girl who moved in,
I tell you what.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.727
Wow. Dusting the den, huh?

09:21.811 --> 09:24.146
You're really going the whole 8.2 meters.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.190
- What?
- Oh, sorry, nine yards.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.067
I just read so many European authors,

09:28.067 --> 09:29.819
I slip into metric sometimes.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.530
Anyway, Alana, could you
do me a favour-- with a "U"--

09:32.530 --> 09:34.824
and maybe do a little less housework?

09:34.824 --> 09:37.868
Less housework?
But that's why Lois hired me.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.788
Well, I worry Lois
might be feeling a little displaced

09:40.788 --> 09:43.165
since you've been doing so much
around the house lately.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.042
Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.378
I would never want
to make her feel uncomfortable.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.298
Hey, maybe we should
discuss this while I brush your fur.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.174
Okay, I see what you're doing.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.926
This kind of stuff
may have worked with the kids,

09:54.010 --> 09:56.345
but I kind of look out for Lois
in a way that they don't.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.098
And believe me, Alana,
I can get pretty mean if I want to.

09:59.098 --> 10:02.101
Oh, Brian, that's adorable.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.937
And I love that you're
so protective, but come on.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.023
We all know you're just a big sweetheart.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.275
And even if you were
able to be mean to me,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.152
I'd still be loving you.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.279
Yeah, well... "Loving," you say?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.783

<i>Alana's victory over
our family was complete,</i>

11:53.379 --> 11:58.300
<i>and Lois realized she needed

11:58.384 --> 12:00.094
Oh, hey, Loni.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.138
Uh-oh, she's trying to assert dominance

12:02.138 --> 12:03.889
by creating a fake nickname.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.933
I see you're giving a bath
to the Stew-Man.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.393
She does it to me, too.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.271
So, I was thinking, since you're so close

12:10.271 --> 12:13.107
to making the $1,200
you need for Juilliard,

12:13.107 --> 12:15.443
why don't I just throw in
the difference for this week

12:15.443 --> 12:18.529
and get you on your way, huh?

12:18.529 --> 12:19.989
Thanks, Lois.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.199
I'm so excited for
you to spread your wings

12:22.283 --> 12:24.243
and pursue your dreams.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.536
She wants you out of here.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.496
This is so generous, Lois.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.082
I'll be on my way
first thing in the morning.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.879
Okay, you're all done, little man.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.132
All right, let's do backside first,

12:38.132 --> 12:40.342
get the heavy lifting out of the way.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.096
<i>Lois thought the $1,200</i>

12:44.180 --> 12:45.765
<i>had gotten Alana out of her life,</i>

12:45.765 --> 12:47.892
<i>but it was the other way around.</i>

12:47.892 --> 12:49.727
Here's $1,200.

12:49.727 --> 12:52.521
I want Lois Griffin dead by morning.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.694
Whoa! I can finally
send my nephew to Juilliard.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.070
He plays the melodica.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.865
- Really? Is he any good?
- You tell me.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.910
He did the opening fanfare
for 20th Century Fox.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.401
Good morning, Chris. Good morning, Meg.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.529
Good morning, Loi... Lois?!

13:42.822 --> 13:44.281
My clothes were in the wash,

13:44.365 --> 13:46.492
so I borrowed your clothes
and Peter's bra.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.911
Boy, my morning jog was murder.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.580
But, Alana, why is your hair red?

13:51.664 --> 13:53.165
I decided to dye it.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.959
I'm a huge Kathy Griffin fan.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.502
Well, that doesn't add up.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.504
No one is a huge Kathy Griffin fan.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.091
I beg to differ.
Sometimes comedy is just energy.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.010
And who cut my head
out of these family photos?

14:06.387 --> 14:07.847
Sorry, that was me.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.099
Alana and I did
some scissoring last night.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.268
Is that so?

14:12.268 --> 14:15.479
Oh, we were just having
a little fun and got carried away.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.731
Tell you what, I'll fix all the pictures

14:17.815 --> 14:19.900
as soon as I get back
from doing the groceries.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.988
I do the groceries, Alana.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.490
You won't like me when I'm groceries.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.160
When I get back from the market,

14:30.244 --> 14:32.454
I think it's best if you're gone.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.331
I understand.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.878
And don't worry, Lois.

14:38.878 --> 14:42.923
After today, I promise
you will never see me again.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.099
All right, let's check the grocery list.

14:52.099 --> 14:55.102
Dozen eggs, orange juice, bread,

14:55.102 --> 14:57.313
and one Sara Lee cheesecake I will take

14:57.313 --> 14:59.481
tiny finger pinches of all the way home

14:59.565 --> 15:01.525
and then throw in the outside trash.

15:01.609 --> 15:04.361
Oh, God, I love shopping!

15:06.947 --> 15:09.158
What's this?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.285
Newer? Fancier?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.541
What the hell?

15:17.625 --> 15:19.668
All they sell here is rope and body bags?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.629
I... Uh-oh.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.053
You guys, I just found this note from Mom.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.388
"Dear family,
I've decided to leave you all

15:31.472 --> 15:33.015
and become a lesbian."

15:33.015 --> 15:34.600
Wait, we can just do that?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.477
Dad, how did this happen?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.062
I blame myself.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.522
Because of my fat, I can't be on top.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.524
<i>The whole family was so alarmed</i>

15:42.608 --> 15:44.526
<i>that no one noticed Alana at the piano</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:46.612
<i>practicing Lois' part of the theme song.</i>

15:50.616 --> 15:53.827

16:13.097 --> 16:15.933
I let take over my life
and family this past week?

16:15.933 --> 16:17.810
- Please!
- Shut up.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.436
We're taking you to die.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.814
- Well, are we there yet?
- No.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.692
- Are we there yet?
- No! God.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.610
- Just give her the iPad.
- No.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.404
The book says kidnap victims are getting

16:28.404 --> 16:30.114
too much screen time these days.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.991
They bond with the iPad, not with us.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

16:42.835 --> 16:44.586
- Yeah?
- Please.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.296
Please don't let two white women

16:46.380 --> 16:48.674
make a podcast about my disappearance.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.766
Kids, now that your mother is gone,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.019
I want you to be prepared for a lot of pee

17:00.019 --> 17:02.021
on the floor next to the toilet.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.314
This is a speech no father should ever

17:04.398 --> 17:05.941
have to give his children.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.359
I don't think you guys understand

17:07.443 --> 17:08.944
what a huge loss this is.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.280
Oh, I fully understand, Brian.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.033
Lois is an angel. She's my soul mate.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.119
There's never been another Lois,
and there never will be.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.787
Not for me.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.706
She's irreplaceable.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.959
Hey, Dad, what's for dinner tonight?

17:27.296 --> 17:29.465
<i>And so we return to where we began:</i>

17:29.465 --> 17:32.634
<i>with Alana and her rather twisted path
to the altar.</i>

17:41.643 --> 17:43.979
<i>It's a very logistically kooky church.</i>

17:44.063 --> 17:46.774
We have gathered today
suspiciously quickly

17:46.774 --> 17:49.610
to celebrate the union
of this man and this woman.

17:49.610 --> 17:53.072
Now, before we begin,
let me just say that yes,

17:53.072 --> 17:56.658
I am the priest from YouTube
who plays the guitar.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.619
Pretty cool priest.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.246
You can also catch me
playing <i>Fortnite</i> on Twitch.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.874
Now, I understand
Peter has written his own vows.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.460
Oh, no!
- Yes, I have.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.962
And I'm definitely not
just reusing the vows

18:09.046 --> 18:11.799
I said to Lois when we
got married in the late '90s.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.468
"Dear Lois: Whassup?

18:14.468 --> 18:16.220
"You're the love of my life.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.930
Yada yada yada, I'm hungry."

18:17.930 --> 18:20.015
Unless anyone has a reason why these two

18:20.099 --> 18:22.017
should not be married, I hereby...

18:26.355 --> 18:27.773
Wait! Stop!

18:31.527 --> 18:34.113
What is this?
In all my years as a cool priest,

18:34.113 --> 18:35.989
I've never seen such a commotion

18:36.073 --> 18:37.574
at Our Lady at the Bottom of the Hill.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.077
This woman tried to take over my life

18:40.077 --> 18:41.829
and murder me and...

18:41.829 --> 18:43.956
Oh, my God, you're the guitar priest.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.125
Oh, boy, not this.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.418
This is the last thing I wanted.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.296
Okay, now, who here knows "Jumper"?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.632
This is a very serious accusation.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.926
- Is it true, Alana?
- I...

18:55.926 --> 18:57.719
I'm sorry, Lois.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.305
I just wanted your life so badly.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.015
I've never seen a man love his wife

19:02.099 --> 19:03.642
as much as Peter loves you.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.644
God, you need to get out more.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.355
And your beautiful children and your dog.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.107
The baby, I never liked.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.692
Well, I was onto you, so...

19:11.692 --> 19:13.277
That's not why.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.987
And you were gonna marry her?

19:14.987 --> 19:16.530
I'm sorry, Lois.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.448
The only things I liked about Alana

19:18.532 --> 19:20.409
was the stuff she stole from you.

19:20.409 --> 19:23.871
But who needs her
when I got the genuine article right here?

19:23.871 --> 19:26.206
I guess what I'm trying to say is:

19:26.290 --> 19:28.292
What's for dinner?

19:28.292 --> 19:30.419
Oh, Peter.

19:30.419 --> 19:34.381

"They"? "Serve"?

20:34.733 --> 20:36.944
Knitting class? What stitch?

20:36.944 --> 20:38.528
All of them, I guess?

20:38.612 --> 20:41.907
I want to switch. I want to switch.
