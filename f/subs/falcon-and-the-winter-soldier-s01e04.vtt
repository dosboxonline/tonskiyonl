00:04.625 --> 00:05.792
There were people in there.

This is the only language
these people understand.

00:10.583 --> 00:13.667

shelter and medicine.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.583
That kinda thing creates loyalty, man.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.375
We've literally tried everything we can.

00:17.458 --> 00:19.083
We bet on someone with a better hand.

00:19.167 --> 00:21.458
Someone recreated the super-soldier serum.

00:21.542 --> 00:25.000
You are assuming HYDRA
has something to do with this,

00:26.083 --> 00:27.583
which is why you came to me.

00:27.667 --> 00:30.875
Luckily, for you, I know where to begin.

00:31.792 --> 00:32.792
Drop it, Zemo.

00:32.875 --> 00:33.958
Sharon?

00:34.042 --> 00:37.208
Karli Morgenthau and at least seven others
have taken the serum.

00:37.292 --> 00:39.333
We got a name. Wilfred Nagel.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.917
-How many vials did you make?
-Twenty.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.250
SAM: Where's Karli now?

00:43.333 --> 00:44.333
A couple of days ago,

00:44.417 --> 00:48.083
she called and asked if I could help
someone named Donya Madani.

00:48.167 --> 00:49.250
(SNIFFLES) I'm sorry.

00:49.333 --> 00:52.583
SAM: She died in Riga,
a city near the Baltic Sea.

00:52.667 --> 00:54.042
I have a place we can go.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.417
I'm gonna go on a walk.

How could you free him?

03:57.208 --> 03:58.208
We need his help.

With time, will, and the resources,

04:02.375 --> 04:06.208

04:09.000 --> 04:11.250
I'm grateful for everything
you and Shuri have done...

04:11.333 --> 04:14.167
Zemo murdered our King T'Chaka at the U.N.

04:15.250 --> 04:17.125

04:17.791 --> 04:19.708
Who chose me to protect him.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.375
I understand.

04:21.458 --> 04:25.917
Very little, if anything,
of our loss and our shame.

Then we come for him.

05:17.292 --> 05:20.167
BUCKY: Well, the Wakandans are here.
They want Zemo.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.667
Bought us some more time.

05:21.750 --> 05:23.167
SAM: Were you followed?
BUCKY: No.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.167
ZEMO: How can you be so sure?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.958
BUCKY: 'Cause I know
when I'm being followed.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.583
It was sweet of you to defend me at least.

05:30.667 --> 05:32.792
Hey, you shut it. No one's defending you.

05:32.875 --> 05:33.875
You killed Nagel.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.458
ZEMO: Do we really have to litigate
what may or may not have happened?

05:37.542 --> 05:40.292
There's nothing to litigate.
You straight shot the man.

05:40.375 --> 05:41.708
-BUCKY: Sam.
-What?

05:42.542 --> 05:45.458
-Karli bombed a GRC supply depot.
-What? What's the damage?

05:45.542 --> 05:47.250
Eleven injured, three dead.

05:47.333 --> 05:48.542
They have a list of demands

05:48.625 --> 05:51.333

05:54.625 --> 05:56.583
I have the will to complete this mission.

05:56.667 --> 05:57.750
Do the two of you?

05:57.833 --> 05:59.292
She's just a kid.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.625
You're seeing something in her
that isn't there.

06:02.208 --> 06:03.417
You're clouded by it.

06:03.917 --> 06:05.417
She's a supremacist.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.708
The very concept of a Super Soldier
will always trouble people.

06:09.792 --> 06:16.708
It's that warped aspiration that led
to Nazis, to Ultron, to the Avengers.

06:16.792 --> 06:19.875
-You're talking about our friends.
-The Avengers, not the Nazis.

06:19.958 --> 06:23.667
So, Karli is radicalized, but there
has to be a peaceful way to stop her.

06:23.750 --> 06:29.375
The desire to become a superhuman cannot
be separated from supremacist ideals.

06:29.458 --> 06:32.875
Anyone with that serum
is inherently on that path.

06:32.958 --> 06:37.000
She will not stop.
She will escalate until you kill her.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.125
Or she kills you.

06:40.208 --> 06:41.458
Maybe you're wrong, Zemo.

06:42.042 --> 06:43.458
The serum never corrupted Steve.

06:45.292 --> 06:47.708
But there has never been
another Steve Rogers, has there?

06:51.583 --> 06:54.167
Well, maybe we should
give him to the Wakandans right now.

06:54.250 --> 06:56.833
-And you'll give up your tour guide?
-Yes.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.250
From my understanding, Donya is like
a pillar of the community, right?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.917
So, when I was a kid, my TT passed away.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.042
Yeah, my TT, yeah.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.625
Who is your TT?

07:08.750 --> 07:11.292
Fine. When I was a kid,
my aunt passed away

07:11.375 --> 07:13.958
and the entire neighborhood
got together for a ceremony.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.042
It was like a week long.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.542
Maybe they're doing
the same thing for Donya.

07:17.625 --> 07:18.917
BUCKY: Worth a shot.

by theradical group
known as the Flag Smashers,

07:45.708 --> 07:49.917
the GRC formally began drafting
legislation known as The Patch Act,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.750
which would seek to restore
traditional border regulations

07:52.833 --> 07:55.125
and fast-track the return to normalcy.

07:56.667 --> 07:59.125

has also brought attention

He always used to tell me,

15:19.792 --> 15:22.167
"If you're doing somethin',
and it makes you scared,

15:22.250 --> 15:24.125
"it's probably because
it's the right thing."

15:25.333 --> 15:26.917
And he fought Nazis, so...

15:27.000 --> 15:30.167
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Seems like good advice.

15:30.250 --> 15:33.500
You know, when I was a kid,
I was actually a Captain America fan.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.042
I don't know if I should
tease you about that yet or not.

15:37.167 --> 15:41.208
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) He made me believe that
there was decent people in this world.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.667
I didn't think there could be another
Captain America until I met you.

15:47.667 --> 15:50.583
You know, back then,
there was just good and bad,

15:51.167 --> 15:53.708
but the world's more complicated now.
People are lost.

15:53.792 --> 15:57.042
They need a leader who looks like them,
who understands their pain.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.542
Someone who understands
that today's heroes

16:00.625 --> 16:02.792
don't have the luxury
of keeping their hands clean.

16:06.417 --> 16:09.375
What we're doing will outlive
the legacy of that shield.

16:09.958 --> 16:12.125
That shield is a monument to a bygone era.

16:12.750 --> 16:15.167
A reminder of all the people
history just left out.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.833
If anything,
that shield should be destroyed.

16:19.792 --> 16:20.792
(EXHALES)

16:23.417 --> 16:25.250
This serum is how we make change.

16:26.917 --> 16:28.875
But first, we pay our respects
to Mama Donya.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.042
Karli Morgenthau is too dangerous
for you guys to be pulling this shit.

16:37.125 --> 16:39.208
BUCKY: Ah! How'd you find us now?

16:39.292 --> 16:42.792
Come on. You think two Avengers can walk
around Latvia without drawing attention?

16:42.875 --> 16:44.792
WALKER: No more keeping us in the dark.

16:44.875 --> 16:47.875
You could start by telling us
why you broke him out of prison.

16:47.958 --> 16:51.667
-He did that himself, technically.
-This better be an unbelievable explana...

16:51.750 --> 16:53.750
Hey, take it easy before it gets weird.

16:53.833 --> 16:55.500
I know where Karli is.

16:57.833 --> 17:01.042
-Well, where?
-SAM: All we know is, it's a memorial.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.667
So, we're gonna intercept her there.

17:02.750 --> 17:05.375
That means civilians.
High risk of casualties.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.750
WALKER: All right, good,
we'll move in fast. Take her by surprise.

17:08.833 --> 17:10.333
No, I wanna talk to her alone.

17:10.416 --> 17:11.791
I'm not losing her again.

17:11.875 --> 17:14.250
Look, the person closest to her died,
she's vulnerable.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.166
Now is the best time to reason with her.

17:16.250 --> 17:19.750
What? No. Wait, no!
No! Stop. Hold on. Stop, okay?

17:19.833 --> 17:22.208
I think we're way past reasoning with her,

17:22.291 --> 17:25.625
unless you forgot that she blew up
a building with people still in it.

17:25.708 --> 17:27.750
Sam, you walk in there cold,
she could kill you.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.417
If I go in hot and the op goes wrong,
more people will die.

17:30.500 --> 17:31.500
You'll let him do this?

17:31.583 --> 17:35.250
Are you gonna let your partner walk
into a room with a Super Soldier alone?

17:35.333 --> 17:37.375
He's dealt with worse.
And he's not my partner.

17:37.458 --> 17:40.042
I used to counsel soldiers
dealing with trauma, okay?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.042
-This is in my wheelhouse.
-WALKER: I know.

17:42.125 --> 17:45.167
And I know those soldiers,
which is why I know this is a bad idea.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.292
Wait, John.

17:46.958 --> 17:50.375
If he can talk her down,
it might be worth a try.

17:53.417 --> 17:54.417
(SCOFFS)

17:57.083 --> 17:58.500
We'll deal with you later.

17:58.583 --> 18:01.167
I'm sure it will all
come to an agreeable conclusion.

18:01.250 --> 18:03.125
My associate is just up ahead.

18:14.333 --> 18:15.417
ZEMO: Hello, my friend.

18:16.833 --> 18:18.667
This is for your family.

18:21.958 --> 18:23.167
Can you show us the way?

18:27.958 --> 18:29.042
What the hell?

18:45.042 --> 18:46.167
Karli's in there.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.458
SAM: All right.

18:49.083 --> 18:50.083
(ZEMO GROANS)

18:50.167 --> 18:52.083
-Hey. You got ten minutes.
-ZEMO: Really?

18:52.167 --> 18:53.167
(HANDCUFFS LOCKING)

18:53.250 --> 18:54.667
Then we're doing things my way.

18:55.500 --> 18:56.500
ZEMO: Aggressive.

18:58.417 --> 18:59.500
But I get it.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.833
KARLI: I don't remember
my mother or my father.

19:12.000 --> 19:15.042
Same goes for siblings,
grandparents, cousins.

19:16.875 --> 19:18.500
What I do remember is bein' alone.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.792
Worse than bein' hungry or cold or scared.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.083
I was alone.

19:27.250 --> 19:28.417
Until Mama Donya.

19:30.042 --> 19:32.208
Like a lot of you here,
Mama Donya saved me.

19:33.375 --> 19:38.833
She clothed me, fed me, loved me.

19:47.625 --> 19:48.625
(GASPS SOFTLY)

20:00.542 --> 20:03.167
She taught me that
we have to do for each other

20:03.250 --> 20:04.250
because they won't.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.750
And we know who they are.

20:08.292 --> 20:10.500
They imposed struggle and hardship on us,

20:10.583 --> 20:13.000
then labeled us as criminals
for pushing back.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.917
But the struggle
is what brings us all together.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.708
People who have nothin' in common.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.375
For we are, after all,
simply one world and one people.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.708
So live accordingly.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.000
(WALKER BREATHING HEAVILY)

21:14.542 --> 21:15.667
I saw you back there.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.542
I came alone.

21:23.875 --> 21:24.875
I just wanna talk.

21:25.792 --> 21:26.875
Bold of you.

21:29.542 --> 21:30.833
I'm sorry for your loss.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.167
Don't condescend to me. I'm not a child.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.667
I'm not.
I know what it's like to lose someone.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.458
-Believe me.
-No, you don't. Not like this.

21:40.375 --> 21:42.167
It doesn't have to be a war, Karli.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.250
They started a war

21:43.333 --> 21:46.083
as soon as they kicked us out
of our new homes and onto the street.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.333
People around the world need me.
Millions of them.

21:48.417 --> 21:51.500
Right, I can't speak for millions,
but I understand you.

21:52.625 --> 21:54.792
I understand your frustration.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.375
I understand your helplessness.

22:03.917 --> 22:06.750
So, you want me to stop
because people are gettin' hurt, right?

22:07.500 --> 22:10.167
But, Sam, what if
I'm making the world a better place?

22:10.250 --> 22:12.542
No, it's not a better place
if you're killin' people.

22:12.625 --> 22:13.792
It's just different.

22:16.417 --> 22:19.417
You're either brilliant
or just hopelessly optimistic.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.042
(SAM CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

22:22.458 --> 22:24.458
-Well, can't I be a little bit of both?
-No.

22:30.583 --> 22:35.583
WALKER: Uh-uh.
No, no, no. This is a bad idea.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.958
It hasn't been ten minutes, John.
Just sit tight.

22:38.042 --> 22:40.833
Don't do that. Don't patronize me.

22:41.542 --> 22:42.792
BUCKY: He knows what he's doing.

22:51.292 --> 22:52.292
I'm goin' in.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.458
This is all really easy for you, isn't it?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.458
All that serum runnin' through your veins.

23:08.458 --> 23:12.000
Barnes, your partner
needs backup in there.

23:16.708 --> 23:19.208
Do you really want his blood
on your hands?

23:21.500 --> 23:22.625
SAM: This guy I know,

23:22.708 --> 23:27.375
who knows more about Super Soldiers
than anyone else on the planet,

23:27.458 --> 23:28.542
he says...

23:30.583 --> 23:32.083
you're a supremacist.

23:32.750 --> 23:34.458
-Me?
-Yeah.

23:34.542 --> 23:35.917
That's ridiculous.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
Everything I do is to end supremacy.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.833
These corporations and the beasts
who run them, they're the supremacists.

23:41.917 --> 23:44.083
So, let me ask you.

23:45.208 --> 23:46.583
You have more serum, right?

23:47.750 --> 23:48.750
So?

23:51.333 --> 23:53.167
Are you going to increase your army?

23:54.083 --> 23:55.875
You're killin' innocent people.

23:55.958 --> 23:56.958
They're not innocent.

23:57.042 --> 23:59.917
They're roadblocks in my journey
and I'd kill them again if I had to.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.000
Wow.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.708
No, no. I didn't mean it like that.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.083
-You tricked me into sounding like...
-Like what?

24:07.333 --> 24:10.708
The people I'm fightin'
are trying to take your home, Sam.

24:12.167 --> 24:14.292
Why are you here instead of stopping them?

24:17.583 --> 24:20.083
You know, my sister's
waiting for that exact same answer.

24:23.292 --> 24:24.500
I'm not your enemy.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.167
I agree with your fight.

24:28.667 --> 24:30.833
I just can't get
with the way you're fightin' it.

24:32.750 --> 24:34.417
And I'm sure she wouldn't either.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.083
WALKER: Karli Morgenthau,
you're under arrest.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.792
-This is what that was?
-No, wait...

24:42.875 --> 24:45.292
-Tricking me until help came?
-We had enough time to talk.

24:45.375 --> 24:46.542
-KARLI: Nazi.
-Why don't you...

27:33.000 --> 27:35.708
You know, when we first came together,

27:36.375 --> 27:39.375
what were the chances that
we'd all be assigned to the same quarter?

27:40.292 --> 27:41.833
To find people I would've never met,

27:41.917 --> 27:44.792
people I would've been taught
to hate somewhere else?

27:48.083 --> 27:50.333
I thought we'd been... Chosen.

a dozen more of us to fight.

he's working for your new Captain America.
