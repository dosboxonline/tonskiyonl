Dinnertime, everyone.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.663
You know what I'm craving?
Lobster.

00:38.747 --> 00:41.332
Your lobster today
is Dinty Moore stew

00:41.416 --> 00:44.002
from a can too dented
to risk on people.

00:44.002 --> 00:47.213
What does "Dinty" even mean?
Is it an adjective or a guy?

00:47.297 --> 00:48.923
Or a contraction, like,

00:49.007 --> 00:51.301
"Boy, he really screwed up
that meal, din't he?"

00:51.301 --> 00:55.180
I mean, Dinty Moore?
How about Dinty Less, right?

00:55.180 --> 00:57.599
Gold. All of this.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.186
I'll get it.
It might be Jabberjaw.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.063
Uh, you kids don't
remember <i>Jabberjaw,</i>

01:03.063 --> 01:06.524
but your father very badly
wants to meet Jabberjaw.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.568
It came! My hammock came!

01:08.568 --> 01:11.988
Yay, you brought loud energy
into the dining room!

01:12.072 --> 01:13.823
Why did you get
a hammock, Peter?

01:13.907 --> 01:15.825
Well, the year 2020
was a terrible year

01:15.909 --> 01:17.786
for the Corona beer company,
so they had to sell off

01:17.786 --> 01:19.704
all their TV commercial hammocks.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.706
And owning a hammock from TV
has always been

01:21.790 --> 01:23.416
my third-biggest dream.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.335
- My first big...
- Meet Jabberjaw.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.753
Okay, you know about Jabberjaw.

01:26.753 --> 01:30.340
And then my other dream
is to be an NFL referee.

01:34.219 --> 01:36.930
It's good, it's good.
The-the-the kick was good.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.354
Hammock life is the best life, Chris.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.898
Yeah, you clearly wanted
to be seen lying in a hammock,

01:46.898 --> 01:49.567
so I'm glad
I could do that for you.

01:49.651 --> 01:52.278
Now, to drink lemonade
with a southern drawl.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.073
Chip, chip,
guv'nor. Shrimp on the barbie.

01:55.073 --> 01:58.785
You sound like Colonel Sanders.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.747
- Damn it.
- Oh, no.

02:02.831 --> 02:05.583
The neighbor's sprinkler
ruined whatever this is.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.961
Not so fast, Chris.
I don't give up that easy.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.170
Good for you, Dad.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.588
Go knock on the neighbor's door

02:10.672 --> 02:12.924
and have a mildly
uncomfortable conversation.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.217
I give up.

02:23.226 --> 02:25.979
Peter, uh, we can't start
until you start.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.065
I'm sorry, gang, I'm just so mad
at my backyard neighbor.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.692
- What's the problem?
- He's got a sprinkler

02:30.692 --> 02:32.777
going nuts and spraying
on my property.

02:32.861 --> 02:35.405
I just don't know what to do.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.532
<i>Hang on while I close
this law book</i>

02:37.532 --> 02:39.993
<i>and return it to a shelf
of law books.</i>

02:39.993 --> 02:41.453
<i>Have you been injured
in an accident?</i>

02:41.453 --> 02:43.872
<i>Man, I hope so. I'm Brick Baker.</i>

02:43.872 --> 02:45.749
<i>My mama didn't raise no dummy.</i>

02:45.749 --> 02:47.834
<i>And I'm here to get you money.</i>

02:47.834 --> 02:49.419
That almost rhymes.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.254
<i>My specialities are
contract law</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:53.173
<i>and kicking bitch ass for you.</i>

02:53.173 --> 02:54.382
<i>Also probate.</i>

02:54.466 --> 02:56.426
<i>You trip and fall?
Got a dog bite?</i>

02:56.426 --> 02:59.012
<i>You used baby powder on
your vagina, you crazy person?</i>

02:59.012 --> 03:00.930
<i>Well, if you haven't,
start doing it.</i>

03:01.014 --> 03:03.683
<i>Brick Baker's getting you paid.</i>

03:03.767 --> 03:08.313
<i>Ha! You need hot, fresh justice,
so call da Baker.</i>

03:08.313 --> 03:10.482
<i>I said I wasn't wearing that!</i>

03:10.482 --> 03:11.900
Maybe you should
hire that lawyer

03:11.900 --> 03:13.777
to sue the problem neighbor
you got.

03:13.777 --> 03:16.946
Hey, great idea, Cleveland.
I loved his little judge hammer.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.823
Gavel, it's called.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.950
<i>N-N-N-N-N-Now, because this
is a regional commercial,</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:22.994
<i>it's gonna end
just a half a second too early.</i>

03:23.078 --> 03:25.038
<i>But remember, call 22...</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:33.421
Mr. Griffin,
I've reviewed your complaint,

03:33.505 --> 03:35.298
and I think you have
an excellent case.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.802
- That's great.
- N-N-N-N-N-Now, can I tell you something off the record?

03:38.802 --> 03:40.887
<i>"Live At Birdland,</i>
Art Blakey Quartet,

03:40.887 --> 03:43.056
Blue Note Records, 1957."

03:43.056 --> 03:45.392
Okay, I can see that I came
to the right lawyer.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.103
N-N-N-Now, I just need
to file a brief.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.400
Yeah, this-this is gonna
work out. I want to hire you.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.777
Excellent. Let me just
type up your filing.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.570
Name: Peter Griffin.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.031
Favorite WNBA Team--
that's a weird second question.

04:00.115 --> 04:01.449
I'll put "Dallas Wings."

04:01.533 --> 04:02.909
Home address...

04:02.909 --> 04:05.161
Wait, you live
at 31 Spooner Street?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.163
Yeah, cross street: Forker Lane.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.749
Out in Cutlery Estates.
Is that a problem?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.419
Um, nope. No problem.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.379
I got you, Peter Griffin.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.631
When we goes to court,
I will be right there with you.

04:16.715 --> 04:18.633
Just like I say
on my local cable commercial,

04:18.717 --> 04:20.760
"With Brick by your side,
you can't..."

04:28.018 --> 04:30.437
Thanks for helping me find
a lobster roll truck

04:30.437 --> 04:31.646
on Instagram, Stewie.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.064
Eh, I just wish
we didn't have to go

04:33.148 --> 04:35.525
to this stupid,
gentrified waterfront.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.110
This place was so much better

04:37.110 --> 04:39.070
when it sucked
and we never came here.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.031
Well, here's our
lobster roll truck.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.658
Uh, hey, guys?

04:43.742 --> 04:45.285
You're cutting in line.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.456
It starts back there.

04:49.456 --> 04:50.915
What? No.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.209
All I wanted was just
some decent lobster.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.545
You know, Bri, they're right
out there, up for grabs.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.589
We should just go
straight to the source.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.466
What are you even suggesting,
Stewie?

04:59.466 --> 05:02.719
That we, what, we get a lobster
boat and be lobstermen?

05:04.721 --> 05:06.139
Yeah.

05:12.020 --> 05:15.231
Hey, Peter, where's the
defendant? And where's Brick?

05:15.315 --> 05:17.525
Sorry I'm late. I had to make
these small desserts

05:17.609 --> 05:18.985
change their ways.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.695
Ha. Tort reform.

05:20.779 --> 05:23.281
Anyway, let's get this started.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.991
Wha-- Why are you
standing there?

05:25.075 --> 05:27.243
You're supposed to be over here,
suing my neighbor.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.538
Uh, Peter, I am your neighbor.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.582
You're my neighbor?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.000
You're the defendant?

05:34.084 --> 05:36.336
And I'm the courtroom
sketch artist?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.006
I drew a <i>Far Side.</i>

05:47.180 --> 05:48.890
I hire you to sue my neighbor,

05:48.890 --> 05:50.600
and you don't tell me
you're my neighbor?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.268
- That's so unethical.
- Whoa.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.145
I may not have gone
to Harvard Law School,

05:54.229 --> 05:55.438
and I don't even know
if you keep track

05:55.522 --> 05:56.981
of who went to Harvard
Law School...

05:57.065 --> 05:59.150
- I don't.
- ...but I did not go to Harvard Law School

05:59.234 --> 06:01.403
just to have my integrity questioned.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.071
But you said you'd be my lawyer.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.739
Did I, Peter? Think back.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.700
I really want you to think back
really quickly.

06:07.909 --> 06:11.579
Peter, we could've had fun,
but I died.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.499
Yeesh. I-I don't want
to think anymore for a while.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.918
Gentlemen, the jury's waiting.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.294
Your Honor,
you got to understand,

06:18.378 --> 06:20.088
I thought I had a lawyer,
but now...

06:20.088 --> 06:22.382
Very well.
I'll grant a continuance

06:22.382 --> 06:26.136
and just enter into the court
record that you're a chicken.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.596
Wait, what?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.223
It's perfectly routine.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.225
I just note that Peter Griffin

06:32.225 --> 06:35.437
has to run and hide
behind his lawyer daddy.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.689
What-- n-no.
I don't need a lawyer.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.816
I'm gonna beat Brick Baker
all on my own.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.609
But I don't got
an opening statement.

06:41.693 --> 06:45.405
Ooh. I move
for a five-minute recess.

06:49.868 --> 06:51.995
- I'm worried for Peter.
- I'll say.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.413
Brick Baker's gonna win, easy.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.623
Look, he's leaned back
with his feet up,

06:55.707 --> 06:57.959
confidently whistling.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.255
He's, uh, he's not very good
at whistling,

07:02.339 --> 07:04.341
but he's doing the other stuff.

07:09.137 --> 07:11.014
I can't believe
we're doing this.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.058
We're actually going
lobster fishing.

07:13.058 --> 07:15.518
Our way of life
is disappearing, Bri.

07:15.602 --> 07:18.146
Stewie, we got the boat
20 minutes ago. Settle down.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.689
How'd we get the boat, anyway?

07:19.773 --> 07:22.484
Traded it for opioids from
a working-class New Englander

07:22.484 --> 07:24.569
- hooked on opioids.
- Huh.

07:24.569 --> 07:26.821
All right, well, I got
lobster pots, trammel nets,

07:26.905 --> 07:30.283
buoys, chum, rope,
flotation gear and a radio.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.035
- What do you got?
- Opioids.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.079
Stewie, stop screwing around
and give me those opioids

07:34.079 --> 07:35.330
and go get me some more opioids.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.915
Uh, let me check
on Rupert first.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.334
Rupert, how you doing
with that double sheet bend?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.630
Okay, apparently I said
"half hitch" or whatever.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.924
- I don't even know why you brought him.
- Let's not talk about it.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.009
He gets so jealous
when you and I hang out.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.844
Well, tell him he doesn't
have anything to worry about.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.680
He doesn't?

07:54.724 --> 07:57.769
Mr. Griffin, this has been
a huge waste of time.

07:57.769 --> 08:00.939
I hereby find for the defendant,
effective as of the moment

08:00.939 --> 08:02.941
I slam down
my gavel uninterrup...

08:02.941 --> 08:06.528
Wait! Your Honor, we have
evidence relevant to this case.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.114
Who are you?
And what kind of evidence?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.616
I'm an HOA dick,
and I found bylaws proving

08:11.700 --> 08:14.703
that Brick used his sprinklers
on incorrect Tuesdays.

08:14.703 --> 08:17.372
I'm a cop, and I'm gonna
suspiciously turn off

08:17.372 --> 08:20.583
my body cam, in case
something sketchy goes down.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.044
And I found Quahog's original
survey maps,

08:23.128 --> 08:26.631
proving that Brick's sprinklers
aren't even on his own property.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.550
What?

08:30.051 --> 08:32.721
The town surveyor
was being pestered by a bee,

08:32.721 --> 08:35.557
so the property lines
were all twisty-turny.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.143
Oh, that's why
his statue's like that.

08:41.938 --> 08:45.108
Well, this is more than enough
evidence for cartoon court.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.569
I find for the plaintiff.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.778
- Yeah!
- We did it!

08:48.862 --> 08:51.197
Talk about "all rise." Giggity!

08:52.574 --> 08:54.492
G-G-I-T-Y.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.828
Yeah, there's-there's no Ds
in "giggity."

09:03.668 --> 09:06.171
Three hours of lobster fishing
and nothing.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.298
You shouldn't have dumped
all my Percocets in the water.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.175
Now the lobsters are just down
there hanging out

09:10.175 --> 09:12.927
and defrauding the government
for disability checks.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.596
Should we drop our traps
somewhere else?

09:14.596 --> 09:17.057
- Like where?
- I don't know, maybe we try David Harbour.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.601
It's that harbor nobody even
heard of until three years ago,

09:19.601 --> 09:21.061
and now all of a sudden
it's huge.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.645
Eh, we could try Michael Bay.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.939
Although I hear that bay
was mean to Megan Fox.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.274
Maybe Roger Waters?

09:26.358 --> 09:27.650
- George Strait?
- Billy Ocean?

09:27.734 --> 09:29.361
- Ricki Lake?
- River Phoenix?

09:29.361 --> 09:31.905
How are those celebrity
water puns working out?

09:31.905 --> 09:35.033
- Welp, this has been a bust.
- Sea Thomas Howell?

09:35.033 --> 09:37.118
Anyway,
your guys' were good, too.

09:37.202 --> 09:40.038
Uhp, we're due
for an eight-second squall.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.706
I got to go have
an overacting scene

09:41.790 --> 09:44.959
where I curse God
in a boat storm.

09:48.046 --> 09:50.090
Strike me down, you coward.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.801
I have big feelings
about weather.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.887
The storm symbolizes my madness.

09:55.887 --> 09:58.431
This is worth it for fish.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.854
Well, Rupert, clear one
BAFTA's-worth of space

10:04.938 --> 10:06.064
on the trophy shelf.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.691
Rupert?

10:11.027 --> 10:12.946
Rupert.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.614
No!

10:14.698 --> 10:16.032
How did he sink so fast?

10:16.116 --> 10:19.994
He might h-have
a string of metal balls

10:20.078 --> 10:22.247
- uh, hidden within?
- What?

10:22.247 --> 10:23.832
We've been together
a long time, Brian.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.084
We have to do things
to keep it fresh.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.965
Hey there, company.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.717
Hey, brother. Wakanda forever.

10:33.717 --> 10:36.553
- Oh, I don't know.
- What do you want, Brick?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.096
Just came to congratulate you.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.597
Thought I'd be the bigger man.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.058
Bigger man?
You been talking to Lois?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.977
She doesn't measure
from the right spot.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.395
So, no hard feelings?

10:45.395 --> 10:47.397
You have been talking to Lois.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.065
Listen, the moral
of the story is this:

10:49.149 --> 10:51.818
watching you all in the court
today, I realized something.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.778
I may have a fancy law degree
and a phone number

10:53.862 --> 10:55.238
with all twos in it...

10:55.238 --> 10:57.490
...but, Peter, you have friends.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.702
And no one can ever take them
away from you.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.704
He said that weird.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.997
And I bought you a gift:

11:03.997 --> 11:05.665
four tickets
to today's matinee performance

11:05.749 --> 11:08.084
of <i>Surfin' Bird:
An American Musical.</i>

11:10.003 --> 11:11.629
- Awesome!
- Live theater!

11:11.713 --> 11:15.508
We'll get to see
<i>Law & Order</i> extras onstage!

11:22.390 --> 11:24.809
Live stage plays are so great.

11:24.893 --> 11:26.936
I hope there's a gentle jibe
about Republicans

11:27.020 --> 11:28.938
so we can have a smug laugh.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.650
You gentlemen
are in the front row.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.778
- Aw, sweet.
- Oh, but not you, sir.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.197
You're all the way back
in the very top.

11:40.658 --> 11:44.496
- What?
- Yeah, just keep going up until you see three corpses in parkas.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.998
<i>♪ Bird, bird,
well, the bird is the word</i> ♪

11:47.082 --> 11:48.500
<i>♪ A-well, a bird, bird, bird,

11:48.500 --> 11:50.085
Man, this sucks.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.711
The stage is so way down there,

11:51.795 --> 11:53.421
the sound doesn't even travel
this far.

11:53.505 --> 11:56.841
The whole show's just being
relayed by some New York mook.

11:56.925 --> 12:00.845
Uh, they're saying everybody's
heard about the bird.

12:00.929 --> 12:03.807
And it goes on, and so forth.

12:03.807 --> 12:07.227
Okay, now they're saying
what the word is.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.521
Bird. It's bird.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.147
Well, may as well
take a terrible,

12:11.231 --> 12:14.359
faraway stage picture
that I'll never look at again.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.695
<i>♪ Bird, bird, bird,

12:16.695 --> 12:18.279

12:31.084 --> 12:33.712
Surely they won't be given
inflatable electric guitars.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.673
Oh! They're being given
inflatable electric guitars.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.385
Oh, man, and now the early
reviews are coming in.

12:40.385 --> 12:41.594

12:41.678 --> 12:44.055
<i>Surfin' bird... ♪</i>

12:44.139 --> 12:48.226
It's, it's like Brick Baker has
taken my friends away from me.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.894
Now what's this?

12:49.978 --> 12:53.815
An unsolicited email from
a local mom I have a crush on?

12:53.815 --> 12:56.526
"Hi, Peter, it's Judy,
just thinking of you.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.195
"I've joined the team
at North Star Realty,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.822
and if you're ever thinking
of selling your home..."

13:00.822 --> 13:02.323
Well, that's disappointing.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.339
Jabberjaw?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.971
<i>Brick, get in the photo,
you old so-and-so.</i>

13:25.055 --> 13:27.515
"Old so-and-so" is my nickname.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.933
Hey, Peter.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.685
Look who decided to drop by.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.604
Hey, why so glum,
you old so-and-so?

13:32.604 --> 13:33.855
All right, that's it.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.482
You like hanging out
with Brick? Fine.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.816
I don't need you guys.

13:36.900 --> 13:40.362
You people are backstabbers.
Like Stabby McBackerson.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.948
Honey? Lee Harvey?
Dinner's on the table.

13:45.450 --> 13:48.411
Well, when <i>can</i> you take a break?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.081
Okay, that's a mix-up.
That was, uh,

13:51.081 --> 13:53.958
that was Lee Harvey Oswald
working from home.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.672
We have to save Rupert.
We have to.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.256
I know, Stewie, but look.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.258
Our only chance is if
he's up here

14:02.342 --> 14:03.802
on the Phoebe Waller-Ridge.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.470
We'll never reach him
if he's fallen down into

14:05.470 --> 14:07.597
the Lin-Manuel Mariana Trench.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.641
Also, Harrison Fjord.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.768
Or-or yours.
Y-Yours are good, too.

15:20.378 --> 15:23.506
And just like that,
Rupert sank forever

15:23.590 --> 15:25.925
into the inky deep.

15:26.009 --> 15:28.386
Also, did you know
that the ocean is

15:28.470 --> 15:30.430
40% fish whiz?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.850
All this and more
on <i>West's Wonders.</i>

15:40.774 --> 15:43.943
Okay, top five racks
in '90s movies. Go.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.446
I'll bite. Maggie Smith,
<i>Death on the Nile.</i>

15:46.446 --> 15:48.448
Right rack, wrong decade.
Who's next?

15:48.448 --> 15:50.158
What the hell is he doing?

15:50.158 --> 15:52.327
His friends ditched him
for Brick Baker,

15:52.327 --> 15:55.246
so he's trying to recreate
the friend experience with us.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.041
- What? No.
- Also, he's still butthurt

15:58.041 --> 16:00.335
'cause Judy from down the street
sent him an email,

16:00.335 --> 16:03.213
- but it was for her realty business, so...
- Okay, that's enough!

16:03.213 --> 16:04.547
Forget this.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.466
I thought it'd be nice
hanging with family,

16:06.466 --> 16:07.717
but it's a disaster.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.011
Like Lee Harvey Oswald
working from home.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.305
This is the tenth one
of these this month.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.265
What do you think,
Detective McBackerson?

16:14.349 --> 16:16.267
Yeah, no, they seem unrelated
and random,

16:16.351 --> 16:18.103
and probably accidents?

16:18.103 --> 16:20.313
What was that?

16:20.397 --> 16:23.900
That was "someone's getting
fired," is what that was.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.197
What are you doing, Brian?
We have to go back.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.657
Stewie, it's over.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.992
Rupert's fallen way too deep.
We can't get to him.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.245
But he's my friend.
We can't just leave him there.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.871
I'm afraid we have to, Stewie.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.915
Even if he is muling
your marital aids.

16:38.915 --> 16:41.084
You know what?
I don't care what you do.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.836
I'm going back to save Rupert.

16:42.836 --> 16:45.672
Fine. Go ahead and try.
You'll be back in one minute.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.632
That's just enough time for me
to remember the name

16:47.716 --> 16:51.177
of the main guy in
<i>That Thing You Do.</i>

16:51.261 --> 16:53.763
Let's see, it was
a three-name guy.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.892
Uh, Paul... Paul Michael Scott?
Thomas?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.561
Okay, I just need to go
through every combination

16:59.561 --> 17:02.063
of Scott, Michael and Thomas,
and I'll get it.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.358
Uh, no, wait, Boo, Boo?
Boopy Rafferty?

17:05.442 --> 17:08.570
Boop-- No? Bachman? Todd.
Bachman Todd!

17:08.570 --> 17:10.822
<i>That Thing You Do,</i>
starring Tom Hanks

17:10.822 --> 17:12.282
and Bachman Todd!
Yeah, yeah.

17:12.282 --> 17:14.117
Okay, I see the poster now.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.703
Whew. What a relief.
Okay, mystery solved.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.746
Oh...

18:49.379 --> 18:51.756
Yeah! All right!

18:51.840 --> 18:54.634
Stupid Brick and
the stupid guys.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.219
Probably doing lame stuff.

18:56.219 --> 18:59.139
Wow, this is the longest
Slip 'N Slide in the world.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.433
N-N-N-N-Now, hold up.
Remember the rule.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.643
Before you slide on it,
you gots to yell out

19:03.727 --> 19:05.103
who you miss right now.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.981
Nobody! Whee!

19:07.981 --> 19:10.191
I got to get my friends back.

19:10.275 --> 19:12.402
All right.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.616
Guys, wait.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.910
- Peter?
- Why you hanging out with Brick?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.912
Sure, he may be cool and smart,

19:22.996 --> 19:24.497
but he doesn't know you
like I do.

19:24.581 --> 19:25.582
How do you mean?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.250
I know all about you guys.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.669
Quagmire, you like a beer
from time to time.

19:29.753 --> 19:32.255
And, Cleveland, you don't mind
a cold one after work.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.425
And you, Joe, you like to relax
with an ice-cold beer.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.594
Wow, he really does know us.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.346
What do you say?
Let's get out of here

19:39.346 --> 19:40.805
and be friends again.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.729
- I think you guys should go with him.
- Huh?

19:47.729 --> 19:49.189
I've had fun
with your crew, Peter,

19:49.189 --> 19:51.399
but the truth is,
this whole time,

19:51.483 --> 19:53.234
all they talked about was you.

19:53.318 --> 19:55.070
They did? Li-Like what?

19:55.070 --> 19:56.988
Something about a bet they had
that you won't live

19:57.072 --> 19:58.573
past the age of 50.

19:58.573 --> 19:59.908
You guys.

19:59.908 --> 20:01.284
They noticed you had
your hand in your pants

20:01.368 --> 20:03.244
the whole time
during the <i>Magic Mike.</i>

20:03.328 --> 20:04.704
Only a friend would know that.

20:04.788 --> 20:06.915
They also said you don't know
how to tie your shoes.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.458
You just mash the laces inside.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.959
I do that for time.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.170
So go on, guys,
Peter's your friend.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.339
I'm just some dude on the block.
It's okay.

20:14.339 --> 20:15.715
You're right, Brick.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.175
Because if there's anything
we've learned

20:17.175 --> 20:19.260
after all these years
with Peter, it's...

20:28.520 --> 20:30.480
Stay tuned for
That Thing You Do,

20:30.480 --> 20:32.649
<i>starring Tom Hanks
and Bachman Todd.</i>

20:32.649 --> 20:34.025
BRIAN
Aha! I knew it.

20:34.109 --> 20:36.611
Well, Peter, I'm glad
everything's back to normal,

20:36.695 --> 20:38.238
and you got your friends back.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.365
But I feel like you
got off on the wrong foot

20:40.365 --> 20:42.492
- with our new neighbor.
- You're right, Lois.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.411
I'm gonna go take care
of that right now.

20:46.538 --> 20:49.165
Brick, I just want
to apologize

20:49.249 --> 20:51.292
for how things got
started between us.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.003
I can see that
you're a good guy,

20:53.003 --> 20:55.588
and I want to welcome you
to the neighborhood.

20:57.757 --> 21:00.927
What? I was just practicing.
