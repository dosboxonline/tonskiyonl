[gunshot]

22:32.711 --> 22:34.451
[gunshots continue]

22:38.084 --> 22:39.654
[Dementus] Go around!
Gotta go around!

22:41.191 --> 22:42.789
Find a way around!

22:48.627 --> 22:50.126
[bullet ricochets]

22:57.172 --> 22:58.332

[Furiosa whimpering]

23:28.732 --> 23:30.031
[screaming] Ma!

23:30.166 --> 23:31.567

- [Furiosa] Ma!

23:31.702 --> 23:33.408
[sobbing]

23:33.543 --> 23:34.870
- Ahh...
- [interrogator] Tell me!

23:35.005 --> 23:36.342
She's your mother. Perfect.

23:36.478 --> 23:39.417
Where are you from?

23:40.248 --> 23:41.181
Tell me!

23:41.317 --> 23:42.453
[Furiosa] Ma!

23:44.186 --> 23:46.451
Tell me where you came from
and we will cease and desist.

23:46.586 --> 23:49.117
Furiosa! [screams]

23:49.253 --> 23:50.558
- [sobbing]
- All you have to do...

23:50.694 --> 23:53.520
All you have to do
is just point.

23:53.655 --> 23:57.028
Point me in the right direction
and I'll take you home.

23:57.995 --> 24:00.262
No, no, no. Don't look away.

24:01.030 --> 24:02.471
We mustn't look away.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.541
[interrogator]
You had your chance.

24:06.875 --> 24:09.579
History Man,
a Word Burger, please?

24:10.146 --> 24:11.114
Tears.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.980
[History Man] Human tears.

24:13.115 --> 24:15.517
The secretions of the lacrimal
gland containing oils,

24:15.653 --> 24:17.916
salts, proteins,
and stress hormones.

24:18.051 --> 24:19.489
The tears of joy
and those of sorrow

24:19.624 --> 24:21.250
have different
chemical compositions.

24:22.887 --> 24:24.858
Yes. Sorrow is more...

24:26.054 --> 24:27.861
...piquant, zesty.

24:29.133 --> 24:31.029
[Furiosa crying]

25:02.298 --> 25:03.831
[gunshot]

25:04.927 --> 25:06.427
[gunshot]

25:15.845 --> 25:17.141
[Dementus] Why would you
run from me?

25:17.873 --> 25:19.343
[groans]

25:19.479 --> 25:22.212
Now your followers must fight
over who gets to kill you.

25:23.282 --> 25:24.813
Now, I would've welcomed you.
Every one.

25:24.949 --> 25:26.216
I woulda brought you in.

25:26.351 --> 25:28.592
You coulda been a part
of this great horde.

25:29.558 --> 25:32.061
Now, we have a problem.

25:32.797 --> 25:36.226
There are 20 of you,
but only five bikes.

25:36.993 --> 25:38.261
How do we choose?

25:38.396 --> 25:40.995
Who's got the goods,
the bollocks, the testes

25:41.130 --> 25:42.804
to ride with Dementus?

25:44.171 --> 25:46.137
You're gonna have to show me
who you are.

25:49.674 --> 25:50.744
Yes?

25:50.880 --> 25:54.979
Because today
we dance to Darwin.

25:55.115 --> 25:59.221
Today, we do
The Five Bike Teddy.

25:59.356 --> 26:03.022
Ready, setty, go!

26:04.362 --> 26:06.487
[all yelling, grunting]

26:20.739 --> 26:21.645
[cackling]

26:24.049 --> 26:25.209
[grunts]

26:28.677 --> 26:30.313
You don't have to watch
if you don't want to.

26:31.688 --> 26:33.283
You may wanna close your eyes.

26:39.391 --> 26:41.929
You know,
you could hold this if you want.

26:44.195 --> 26:46.629
It belonged to my little ones.

26:47.332 --> 26:49.464
Why don't you
just keep him safe?

27:00.676 --> 27:04.815
Lady and gentlemans,
start your engines.

27:04.951 --> 27:07.383
[motors starting, revving]

27:12.220 --> 27:14.632
[engines roaring]

27:28.813 --> 27:32.144
Lizard mince
and human blood sausage.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.171
[engines rumbling]

28:15.294 --> 28:16.760
Can you write?

28:19.655 --> 28:22.191
I can teach you.
Muscle up your memory.

28:22.326 --> 28:23.833
You could become a History Man.

28:31.136 --> 28:32.875
Make yourself invaluable,

28:34.043 --> 28:36.076
and Dementus
will look after you.

29:21.253 --> 29:23.052
[History Man] <i>Astronavigation.</i>

29:23.922 --> 29:28.257
<i>A determination of one's course
by reference to the stars</i>

29:28.392 --> 29:30.999
<i>and other celestial bodies.</i>

29:40.136 --> 29:41.537
Red! Red!

29:42.239 --> 29:44.014
Are we curious, boss?

29:44.583 --> 29:46.410
Well, let's go have a look.

30:07.034 --> 30:08.465
[War Boy] Is this Halvalla?

30:09.034 --> 30:10.401
Am I in Valhalla?

30:11.035 --> 30:12.170
What's Valhalla?

30:12.305 --> 30:14.401
Valhalla's
"The Hall of the Slain."

30:14.536 --> 30:16.411
A paradise for dead heroes.

30:16.547 --> 30:17.606
Good for you.

30:17.741 --> 30:19.179
We're looking for a place
of abundance.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.108
What's abundance?

30:21.477 --> 30:23.821
Abundance, plentifulness.

30:25.023 --> 30:28.824
Having a copious quantity
of something.

30:28.960 --> 30:31.189
[War Boy] Co--
What's "copus quantity"?

30:31.324 --> 30:33.056
A lotta stuff.
A lotta good stuff.

30:33.191 --> 30:34.154
[War Boy] The Citadel.

30:34.289 --> 30:35.298
The what-a-del?

30:35.934 --> 30:36.960
[War Boy]
It's where I was birthed.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.361
It's got everything.

30:38.496 --> 30:40.696
A humongous amount
of fresh water.

30:41.098 --> 30:42.237
And green stuff.

30:43.306 --> 30:47.376
Mountains of pro-juice
and veggies and... and water.

30:48.112 --> 30:50.045
And where would one
find this Citadel?

30:51.845 --> 30:53.448
That way maybe.

30:53.583 --> 30:54.313
What are these?

30:55.416 --> 30:57.811
That is sky blood.
It called you to me.

31:16.298 --> 31:18.304
[flies buzzing]

31:21.446 --> 31:23.346

32:42.727 --> 32:44.324
[motors fall silent]

32:46.255 --> 32:49.428
[History Man on loudspeaker]
Behold the might of Dementus!

32:50.799 --> 32:53.296
The Red Dementus

32:53.431 --> 32:57.766
and his Congress of Destruction.

32:58.943 --> 33:02.107
He is here to lay siege on you.

33:02.243 --> 33:05.609
Listen carefully to his words.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.681
[voice echoing] All of you.

33:13.083 --> 33:17.786
All who protect and honor
this magnificent Citadel,

33:19.059 --> 33:20.993
you have a choice.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.330
A very attractive choice.

33:25.264 --> 33:26.965
I want your leaders.

33:27.101 --> 33:28.500
[scattered cheering]

33:28.635 --> 33:32.242
I want those
who hold dominance over you.

33:33.178 --> 33:36.510
Bring me your leaders
and throw them down.

33:37.146 --> 33:38.681
Throw them down,
and you'll avoid

33:38.817 --> 33:41.243
more suffering and sorrow.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.384
They exploit you.
They enslave you.

33:44.519 --> 33:47.220
They wash their feet
in your sweat and blood

33:47.356 --> 33:50.186
and they give you
nothing in return.

33:50.322 --> 33:52.696
[cheering and laughter]

33:52.831 --> 33:55.154
[Dementus] Listen to this truth.

33:55.290 --> 33:59.636
Big shots rule only
because you choose to follow.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.670
The power is with you.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.067
You are free to choose.

34:04.202 --> 34:06.042
Come to me.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.712
Come to me
with your pain and burden,

34:08.847 --> 34:10.840
and I will double your grub.

34:10.975 --> 34:14.046
Food and water for everyone,
as much you like.

34:14.182 --> 34:16.142
We will share the wealth.

34:16.277 --> 34:20.656
You will rule with me in
the splendor of a new Wasteland.

34:20.791 --> 34:22.653
[bikers cheering]

34:35.068 --> 34:36.067
Adorable.

34:36.202 --> 34:39.141
[laughter, jeers]

34:39.277 --> 34:42.741
I'm afraid for you, sweetheart.
Really afraid.

34:42.877 --> 34:46.576
'Cause Big Jilly here is gonna
scoop you out, both ends,

34:46.711 --> 34:48.812
mush it up
and feed it back to you.

34:48.947 --> 34:51.546
But that ain't nothing compared
to what Mr. Norton here

34:51.681 --> 34:53.320
is dreaming of doing to you.

34:53.456 --> 34:56.126
'Cause Mr. Norton
really hates big shots.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.289
- Then there's Mr. Harley.
- G'day, mate!

34:58.424 --> 35:01.297
Mr. Davidson, Rizzdale Pell

35:01.433 --> 35:04.959
and a thousand other
mad bastards coming after you,

35:05.094 --> 35:08.061
and there ain't nothing
I can do to stop 'em.

35:16.508 --> 35:18.973
The Immortan has a request.

35:20.185 --> 35:22.816
Among all his warriors
assembled here,

35:22.951 --> 35:24.451
choose one.

35:25.747 --> 35:27.888
Why would I do that?

35:28.391 --> 35:30.386
For this negotiation
to go further,

35:30.522 --> 35:33.521
you must choose at random.

35:33.656 --> 35:36.298
Any War Boy. Just one.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.029
What if I choose not to choose?

35:40.832 --> 35:43.030
Then you'll never know
the truth.

35:46.009 --> 35:47.500
My Smeg will choose.

35:47.635 --> 35:50.543
Yes! [giggling]

35:54.311 --> 35:55.108
Okay.

36:09.594 --> 36:10.497
[Smeg] Nope. To the right.

36:27.951 --> 36:29.681
[can clatters]

36:42.866 --> 36:45.763
You are awaited.

36:48.630 --> 36:49.937
Witness me!

36:50.073 --> 36:52.165
[War Boys] Witness!

37:00.182 --> 37:01.746
[War Boys] Immorta!

37:02.549 --> 37:07.720
Among us
are 972 devout warriors.

37:07.855 --> 37:12.152
Any one of them, if chosen,
would've done the same.

37:12.287 --> 37:17.493
Each would die historic
for the Immortan Joe.

37:18.229 --> 37:20.696
- That's why you're fools.
- [biker] You're the fool!

37:20.831 --> 37:23.732
You're all fools
for coming here.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.100
[Immortan Joe breathing deeply]

37:30.574 --> 37:33.943
I am Scrotus.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.649
I am Rictus.

37:38.785 --> 37:42.325
We are the sons
of the Immortan Joe.

37:43.853 --> 37:47.055
And now we're going to kill you.

Hey!

[Furiosa straining]

38:42.981 --> 38:45.784
- [flies buzzing]

38:53.194 --> 38:53.858
I gotcha.

go bonkers, you have to adapt.</i>

39:27.761 --> 39:29.997
- You, same as me.
- [puppy whines]

39:30.133 --> 39:30.961
They're here.

39:32.431 --> 39:33.568
We're tough.

39:34.870 --> 39:36.998
- You're a tender little hound.
- [whimpering]

39:37.134 --> 39:39.106
[Mr. Harley]
A War Rig. Fully loaded.

39:39.776 --> 39:41.341
[The Octoboss] It's from
the Citadel, all right.

39:41.477 --> 39:43.545
It's got the Immortan's mark.

39:51.982 --> 39:54.754
Food and water for guzzolene.

39:56.754 --> 39:58.593
It beats scavenging.

40:00.263 --> 40:02.388
This is our destiny.

40:02.523 --> 40:05.028
We are indeed
in the land of opportunity.

Watch this.

41:31.751 --> 41:33.418
[biker] All hail Dementus!

41:33.553 --> 41:36.086
[bikers] Dementus!

41:37.823 --> 41:40.756
Fuel for all, enough for months.

41:40.892 --> 41:43.292
Thisis truly a great day.

41:43.427 --> 41:45.931
Yeah, well, I'm about to make it
a whole lot greater.

41:46.066 --> 41:48.538
Who are you?
Remove your helmet and jacket.

41:50.935 --> 41:52.832
I take orders from The Octoboss.

41:52.967 --> 41:53.873
[Dementus] Huh?

41:57.776 --> 41:59.511
Yeah, do what he says.

42:00.147 --> 42:03.014
[Dementus] Uh-uh...
Questioning my boss-ority.

42:09.622 --> 42:10.989
[groans] Okay.

42:14.155 --> 42:15.356
All right, that's good.

42:17.795 --> 42:18.799
Right. Go on.

42:19.798 --> 42:21.065
Cover yourself in this.

42:24.207 --> 42:25.003
That's it.

42:26.606 --> 42:27.808
Come on. Come on.

42:30.476 --> 42:31.372
Good?

42:32.776 --> 42:34.045
There ya go.

42:36.050 --> 42:38.511
Choose ten of your men.
The balder the better.

42:42.126 --> 42:43.224
Mortifiers.

42:43.360 --> 42:44.424
[Dementus] Settle down.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.519
Who wants to be a War Boy?

[bell ringing weakly]

43:11.454 --> 43:13.282
[ringing continues]

43:28.699 --> 43:30.470
What?

43:30.605 --> 43:31.971
[watchman]
<i>The rig's coming back.
I think they're under attack.</i>

43:52.924 --> 43:54.697
Do we open the gates?

43:55.993 --> 43:57.458
No. Something's off.

44:01.439 --> 44:02.634
I'm gonna have to slow down.

44:02.769 --> 44:05.098
No. Faster. Go faster.

44:05.234 --> 44:06.440
They won't open the gate.

44:06.575 --> 44:07.941
They're not buying it.

44:14.141 --> 44:15.117
Shoot them.

44:15.253 --> 44:16.283
[biker] What?

44:16.419 --> 44:17.445
Make it real.

44:19.621 --> 44:20.656
[biker 2] What'd he say?

44:20.792 --> 44:22.615
[biker 2] He wants us
to make it real.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.293
[The Octoboss]
What are you doing?

44:28.429 --> 44:29.424
[yells]

44:31.062 --> 44:33.199
[rider] No, no. No, no, no!

44:33.768 --> 44:37.168
You're scum, Dementus. Scum!

44:40.970 --> 44:41.975
Open the gates.

44:42.576 --> 44:43.878
Open the gates!

44:50.585 --> 44:52.612
[horn blaring]

45:33.121 --> 45:34.559
[gunshots]

45:34.694 --> 45:35.930
Open the gates.

45:37.400 --> 45:39.263
[bikers yelling]

45:59.116 --> 46:01.153
[overlapping chatter]

46:03.954 --> 46:04.827
[man] Back off.

46:05.626 --> 46:06.554
[man 2] Get off.

46:09.097 --> 46:10.767
[Smeg]
Give this to Immortan Joe.

46:11.961 --> 46:12.901
Catch.

46:16.639 --> 46:18.302
Dementus wants to talk.

46:27.584 --> 46:29.146
[man] Are you sure?

46:29.282 --> 46:31.249
[Immortan Joe]
Yes. Let him come.

46:32.380 --> 46:34.820
Body search, no weapons.

46:34.955 --> 46:37.558
Whatever he wants, we'll listen.

46:37.694 --> 46:40.159
Then kill him on the spot.

46:43.765 --> 46:46.099
[respirator hissing]

46:55.711 --> 46:56.670
[Rizzdale] Calm down.

46:57.744 --> 46:58.639
Calm down.

47:05.089 --> 47:07.517
The Red Dementus commends you
on your lifestyle

47:07.652 --> 47:11.454
and for agreeing to these
trade negotiations.

47:17.429 --> 47:19.731
If we're not back safe
by sunset,

47:19.867 --> 47:21.068
we blow up Gastown.

47:24.940 --> 47:27.976
This is how you save Gastown.

47:31.008 --> 47:32.882
[keys clicking]

47:36.915 --> 47:38.481
[grunts softly]

47:41.458 --> 47:45.224
And the six-figure code exists
only in the brain of Dementus.

47:49.363 --> 47:51.891
He wants double.
Double of everything.

47:52.026 --> 47:54.361
One full tank of water
for half a tank of guzzolene.

47:54.496 --> 47:56.198
Can't do that. Not possible.

47:56.333 --> 47:58.006
Then he gets a spike in the nut.

47:59.639 --> 48:01.872
Double the mothers' milk
and double the hydroponics.

48:02.008 --> 48:03.737
[man] Double the spuds.

48:03.872 --> 48:05.915
Double the maggot mash
and the roach gruel.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.106
My boys need all the protein
they can get.

48:08.242 --> 48:09.410
[yelps]

48:09.545 --> 48:12.581
Please. Give him what he wants!

48:12.717 --> 48:16.420
The Wasteland won't sustain it.
Run the numbers.

48:18.157 --> 48:20.692
Please, my Immortan. My brother.

48:20.827 --> 48:23.130
[breath hissing]

48:24.527 --> 48:25.524
[Dementus] Make up your mind.

48:25.659 --> 48:27.596
Can't hold this much longer.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.797
Let Rictus do it, Dad.

48:32.339 --> 48:33.401
I'll squeeze
the code out of him.

48:33.536 --> 48:35.044
- Here, take it. Take it.
- Huh?

48:35.747 --> 48:37.705
- [pained grunt]
- [groans]

48:41.684 --> 48:42.710
Oh, you idiot.

48:44.513 --> 48:45.778
I've forgotten the numbers.

48:45.914 --> 48:47.213
- [Dementus] Wait, wait, wait.
- [yells]

48:47.348 --> 48:49.718
Wait! [groaning]

48:49.854 --> 48:52.621
Yep, it's in there,
got it, got it, got it, okay.

48:53.487 --> 48:54.690
[groans, shivers]

48:54.825 --> 48:57.031
The pleasure flushed them
clean out of my head.

48:57.166 --> 48:58.261
Don't ever do that again, comrades.

48:58.396 --> 48:59.936
I'm a man with a fragile brain.

49:02.869 --> 49:03.764
Who's that?

49:07.472 --> 49:11.838
That... is my daughter,
Little D.

49:12.483 --> 49:13.774
Little Dementus.

49:16.314 --> 49:17.813
She looks nothing like you.

49:17.949 --> 49:19.479
[Dementus] Yes, well, she has
her mother's perfections,

49:19.614 --> 49:20.823
and none of my deficiencies.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.256
[Immortan Joe]
Where's the mother?

49:22.391 --> 49:25.359
[sighs] Magnificent woman.
Fierce, intelligent.

49:25.495 --> 49:28.430
Taken so cruelly protecting
this little one from marauders.

49:28.565 --> 49:29.988
She looks pale.

49:30.758 --> 49:33.432
You look pale. She's perfect.

49:33.567 --> 49:35.602
Not like the genetic absurdities
you have for sons.

49:35.737 --> 49:37.171
[growls quietly]

49:37.306 --> 49:40.305
Well, she's pale
because I take her blood,

49:40.441 --> 49:42.774
for blood pudding
that I prepare for him.

49:42.909 --> 49:44.343
And who are you?

49:45.777 --> 49:49.150
Well, I'm the Organic Mechanic.
All things therapeutic.

49:49.285 --> 49:52.754
Now, make no mistake,
she is a full-life.

49:52.889 --> 49:55.783
Untouched by man or disease.

49:56.891 --> 49:58.995
[breathes heavily]

49:59.130 --> 50:00.953
Would you like to stay here
in the Citadel?

50:01.465 --> 50:02.361
Eh?

50:03.498 --> 50:05.032
[Immortan Joe]
If I let you stay and you grow

50:05.167 --> 50:06.528
to become a strong,
healthy woman,

50:06.664 --> 50:08.467
you could become
one of our wives.

50:09.036 --> 50:10.532
No, she's my daughter.

50:10.668 --> 50:12.839
It will be
a royal intermarriage.

50:12.975 --> 50:14.371
The bonding of dynasties.

50:14.507 --> 50:16.474
Her whole life
I have protected her,

50:16.609 --> 50:18.236
from the sun, the wind,
every lecherous gaze.

50:18.372 --> 50:19.147
No.

50:20.378 --> 50:22.082
You'll be bonded by blood.

50:22.218 --> 50:23.976
No! She's not for sale,
she's mine.

50:24.821 --> 50:26.682
What say you, child?

50:28.017 --> 50:30.052
She hasn't spoken
since her mother's tragic end.

50:30.188 --> 50:31.489
Very poignant.

50:38.459 --> 50:40.366
[breath hissing]

50:42.431 --> 50:44.205
Is he your father?

50:47.511 --> 50:48.341
No.

50:56.150 --> 50:57.878
He slaughtered my mother.

51:00.615 --> 51:02.047
True, that is true.

51:02.183 --> 51:03.915
And I can tell you
it made this child tough.

51:04.051 --> 51:05.518
Tough enough
to survive all sorrows

51:05.653 --> 51:06.661
that may come her way.

51:06.797 --> 51:08.588
I did that for her.

51:08.723 --> 51:10.066
[softer] I did that for her.

51:14.765 --> 51:17.199
I will increase
your shipment of water.

51:17.335 --> 51:18.772
But only by a third.

51:19.375 --> 51:21.367
I will increase your food
by a quarter.

51:21.503 --> 51:23.244
Potatoes only.

51:23.379 --> 51:26.113
You'll get your delivery
once every ten days,

51:26.249 --> 51:28.784
but only if my War Rigs
return safely

51:28.920 --> 51:31.417
full of high-grade guzzolene.

51:34.052 --> 51:34.783
Deal.

51:36.186 --> 51:41.394
And... I will take this girl,
who is not your daughter.

51:42.425 --> 51:44.595
And also, him.

51:46.496 --> 51:48.203
Otherwise, it's war.

51:59.675 --> 52:00.776
[Dementus whistles sharply]

52:16.160 --> 52:17.364
[grunts]

52:30.177 --> 52:33.512
You behave, I'll behave.

52:33.647 --> 52:35.678
I'll protect Gastown
from all treachery.

52:35.814 --> 52:38.846
It will be as impenetrable
as this Citadel.

52:38.981 --> 52:41.920
Stability born
from a world of chaos.

52:42.055 --> 52:44.655
You. Me. We.

52:48.422 --> 52:52.366
Henceforth, I will be addressed
as "The Great Dementus."

52:53.069 --> 52:55.204
Beloved ruler of Bikerdom.

52:56.138 --> 52:58.464
Lord Guardian of Gastown.

52:58.599 --> 52:59.968
[cackling]

53:00.104 --> 53:02.541
Gotta go, gotta go.
Don't want Gastown to go boom.

53:03.643 --> 53:06.038
What a day.
What a deal. What a day.

53:06.173 --> 53:07.880
[Rizzdale]
Beautifully played, boss.

53:08.483 --> 53:10.780
- Peak Dementus! Eh? Eh?
- [men laughing]

53:18.894 --> 53:20.757
[bells jingling]

53:47.357 --> 53:49.753
It's all right.
You'll be all right.

53:53.020 --> 53:53.993
[Organic Mechanic] <i>All right.</i>

53:54.796 --> 53:58.225
Now, shove that little beauty
out into the world.

53:58.361 --> 53:59.932
- [woman breathing heavily]
- [Organic Mechanic] Come on.

54:00.068 --> 54:00.929
Here it comes.

54:01.829 --> 54:03.338
I can see its head.

54:03.473 --> 54:05.169
- [laughing]
- [heavy breathing continues]

54:05.305 --> 54:06.671
[woman yelling hoarsely]

54:06.806 --> 54:09.102
[Organic Mechanic]
Good girl. Good girl.

54:11.075 --> 54:13.507
- [bells jingling]
- [Organic Mechanic] Oh, yeah.

54:13.643 --> 54:15.310
You're very clever.

54:15.445 --> 54:16.411
One last shove.

54:16.547 --> 54:18.946
[woman gasping, yelling]

54:19.082 --> 54:20.618
[Organic Mechanic]
One more, one more.

54:20.754 --> 54:23.622
- [woman yelling, sobbing]
- Very good.

54:24.687 --> 54:26.653
[newborn baby crying]

54:26.789 --> 54:28.957
Is it a boy? Is it a boy?

54:30.527 --> 54:32.393
[baby shrieks]

54:32.529 --> 54:34.336
More or less.

54:35.696 --> 54:37.229
Sorry, boss.

54:38.441 --> 54:40.105
[woman]
I will give you a full-life!

54:40.240 --> 54:41.409
I know that I can.

54:42.412 --> 54:44.011
[Scrotus]
Three strikes, you're out.

54:44.147 --> 54:45.644
- Rictus.
- [clap echoes]

54:49.449 --> 54:50.951
[woman] Please, let me stay.

54:51.086 --> 54:52.746
Don't fret, love.

54:52.881 --> 54:55.291
You'll make an excellent milker.

55:10.370 --> 55:12.165
[bells jingling softly]

55:33.864 --> 55:35.727
[bells jingling]

55:48.969 --> 55:50.445
[blade sawing at hair]

56:28.745 --> 56:29.847
[Rictus] What's this?

56:34.816 --> 56:36.458
[bells jingle]

56:43.758 --> 56:45.962
[jingling]

56:49.070 --> 56:50.065
[grunts]

56:58.839 --> 57:00.273
[bells jingling]

57:17.696 --> 57:20.764
Rictus. You lose something?

57:20.900 --> 57:23.135
Just looking.
Just looking around.

57:23.270 --> 57:24.299
What for?

57:24.435 --> 57:26.134
Nothing.

57:26.269 --> 57:28.341
No. Don't lie to me.
You're up to something.

57:28.477 --> 57:30.512
- What is it?
- Nothing.

57:31.878 --> 57:33.343
Well, what're you
doing here then?

57:33.478 --> 57:34.615
[bells jingling]

57:34.750 --> 57:36.181
[Rictus] I thought
I saw someone running.

57:36.317 --> 57:37.578
Running away.

57:38.314 --> 57:40.819
But it was just a dream.
An annoying dream.

57:41.884 --> 57:43.925
[footsteps receding]

57:44.060 --> 57:45.593
[growls softly]

57:48.999 --> 57:50.422
[feet thudding]

57:51.464 --> 57:53.326
[breathing deeply]

57:59.940 --> 58:02.104
- [wind blowing]
- [bells jingling faintly]

58:15.553 --> 58:17.416
[bells jingling]

58:28.863 --> 58:29.904
[man yells]

58:30.039 --> 58:31.703
Brake!

58:31.838 --> 58:35.203
Dogman. The loose cable!
Secure it!

58:40.179 --> 58:44.014
[Scrotus] Save the bucket!
We need that bucket!

58:56.693 --> 58:58.231
You go down.

58:58.366 --> 59:00.360
No. Someone small.

59:01.433 --> 59:02.538
You!

59:04.205 --> 59:05.332
Come on.

59:08.440 --> 59:10.040
No. Him.

59:24.457 --> 59:25.825
[grunts softly]

59:48.008 --> 59:50.212
[metal creaking]

01:00:11.232 --> 01:00:13.070
You've got a lot of ticker, boy.

01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:14.874
Brake Man.

01:00:23.353 --> 01:00:24.818
You're the new dogman.

01:00:50.744 --> 01:00:52.945
[Rictus] Line up. Line up.

01:00:54.416 --> 01:00:55.816
Juva-jub-jub.

01:00:58.282 --> 01:01:00.581
Welcome to the house
of holy motors.

01:01:00.717 --> 01:01:03.654
We're gonna make us something
mighty from this boneyard,

01:01:03.790 --> 01:01:06.124
from all these body parts.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:08.955
Two hefty V8 engines,
a chassis for a Prime Mover,

01:01:09.091 --> 01:01:11.766
2,857 found objects.

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.032
And we are going
to put this all together.

01:01:14.167 --> 01:01:17.037
We are going to build
something beautiful.

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:19.836
And we're doing this for who?

01:01:19.971 --> 01:01:21.436
- Immortan Joe.
- Who?

01:01:21.571 --> 01:01:23.710
Who will raise us
from the ashes of this world.

01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:25.771
Are you ready
to be Black Thumbs?

01:01:25.907 --> 01:01:27.014
Immorta!

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:27.839
You?

01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:29.150
Immorta!

01:01:29.286 --> 01:01:30.444
How about you?

01:01:32.145 --> 01:01:33.486
Speak his name.

01:01:33.622 --> 01:01:35.317
He don't speak. He's mute.

01:01:38.122 --> 01:01:39.361
Where have I seen you before?

01:01:39.496 --> 01:01:41.653
He's a dogman. Very useful.

01:01:42.957 --> 01:01:44.327
Scrawny.

01:01:44.963 --> 01:01:46.924
Oi! We've got work to do.

01:01:47.794 --> 01:01:50.200
We're going to build ourselves
a War Rig.

01:01:50.336 --> 01:01:53.099
The finest piece of grunt
in the Wasteland.

01:01:53.235 --> 01:01:55.702
Bigger, stronger, faster!

01:01:55.838 --> 01:01:57.379
Immorta!

01:01:57.514 --> 01:02:00.941
[all] Immorta! Immorta! Immorta!

01:02:01.077 --> 01:02:03.246
[chanting continues]

01:02:09.954 --> 01:02:11.760
[hydraulics whirring]

01:02:20.903 --> 01:02:22.326
We are going to build
a contraption

01:02:22.462 --> 01:02:23.429
that will defend the rear.

01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:26.166
We will call it
"The Bommyknocker."

01:02:26.301 --> 01:02:28.007
Is that the Praetorian Jack?

01:02:32.381 --> 01:02:33.243
He looks lucky.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:40.118
[War Boy] He done the most runs
on the Fury Road.

01:02:41.187 --> 01:02:43.257
And brung back the booty
every time.

01:02:43.392 --> 01:02:45.552
Hey. Prae Jack.

01:02:52.402 --> 01:02:53.895
[ignition cranks]

01:02:54.031 --> 01:02:55.837
[motor rumbles to life]

01:03:09.046 --> 01:03:10.885
[no audible dialogue]

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:26.967
What's going on?

01:03:36.745 --> 01:03:38.880
Why so shy? It's just piss.

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:47.455
They were right,
the crazy brothers.

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.053
She is a mighty thing.

01:03:49.188 --> 01:03:53.059
Bigger, faster,
stronger, further.

01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:09.339
[motor idling]

01:04:20.788 --> 01:04:21.780
[man] Here it comes.

01:04:34.198 --> 01:04:36.036
[motor fades into silence]

01:04:55.887 --> 01:04:57.750
[motor rumbling]

01:05:32.025 --> 01:05:33.526
They look like Mortifiers.

01:05:34.162 --> 01:05:36.059
Mortifiers.
They ride with Dementus.

01:05:36.194 --> 01:05:38.089
Not anymore. They've gone rogue.

01:05:38.225 --> 01:05:39.290
Contact.

01:05:39.426 --> 01:05:41.125
Contact front!

01:05:41.261 --> 01:05:42.426
You, go!

01:05:42.562 --> 01:05:44.434
[overlapping yells]

01:05:55.444 --> 01:05:57.914
Contact right. Contact left.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:05:59.482
[attackers yelling]

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.281
[War Boy] Crossbows, War Boys.

01:06:02.417 --> 01:06:03.249
[War Boy 2] Load up.

01:06:03.385 --> 01:06:04.091
[War Boy 3] Behind you!

01:06:06.495 --> 01:06:07.358
Go!

01:06:09.094 --> 01:06:11.593
[indistinct shouting]

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:35.914
- [horn honking]
- [man shouting outside]

01:06:43.425 --> 01:06:45.132
[indistinct shouting]

01:06:48.934 --> 01:06:50.227
[screaming]

01:06:50.363 --> 01:06:52.403
Witness!

01:07:05.447 --> 01:07:07.253
[grunting with effort]

01:07:09.692 --> 01:07:11.554
[engine dying]

01:07:14.457 --> 01:07:15.360
[Black Thumb] That's engine two.

01:07:20.265 --> 01:07:22.631
All down on top. Replenish!

01:07:23.463 --> 01:07:25.331
[horn bellowing]

01:07:25.467 --> 01:07:27.339
[War Boys shouting]

01:07:49.030 --> 01:07:51.358
[propeller motor fires up]

01:07:51.493 --> 01:07:53.266
[indistinct shouting]

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:05.976
We need a short hose and clamps!

01:08:06.112 --> 01:08:08.446
Short hose. Clamps.

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:11.647
Short hose. Clamps.

01:08:27.901 --> 01:08:29.269
[screams]

01:08:31.167 --> 01:08:32.239
[grunts]

01:08:49.153 --> 01:08:51.192
[yells warning]

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:16.184
[gasps]

01:09:17.249 --> 01:09:19.286
[aggressive grunting]

01:09:26.222 --> 01:09:27.019
Yes!

01:09:39.734 --> 01:09:41.869
Black Thumb? Black Thumb.

01:09:50.116 --> 01:09:51.685
[horn blasts]

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:52.814
Up front.

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:55.055
Can I do the Bommyknocker?

01:09:55.190 --> 01:09:57.018
- What?
- The Bommyknocker.

01:09:57.154 --> 01:09:58.149
Not yet.

01:10:07.733 --> 01:10:09.429
[War Boy] Eyes left.
They're flanking us.

01:10:09.565 --> 01:10:11.365
Eyes right. Eyes right.

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:12.405
They're swarming.

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:16.343
Black Thumb.

01:10:25.686 --> 01:10:27.420
[Praetorian Jack]
Black Thumb! Are you there?

01:10:28.483 --> 01:10:30.489
[motor roaring]

01:10:31.684 --> 01:10:33.151
Now hang tight.

01:10:33.994 --> 01:10:34.922
[tires scraping]

01:10:56.447 --> 01:10:57.709
[laughs triumphantly]

01:10:57.844 --> 01:10:59.111
Prae Jack! Prae Jack!

01:11:20.301 --> 01:11:24.270
Pissboy. Pissboy!
We got a busted radiator.

01:11:25.039 --> 01:11:26.281
[Pissboy]
Copy P-Jack. On my way.

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:33.783
Drink, my rig. Drink this piss.

01:11:34.418 --> 01:11:35.323
[War Boy] Come on.

01:11:39.225 --> 01:11:41.494
[all grunting]

01:11:43.623 --> 01:11:44.827
[grunts]

01:11:47.397 --> 01:11:48.303
Prae Jack.

01:11:59.844 --> 01:12:01.448
- [bottle whirring]
- [gun blasts]

01:12:14.258 --> 01:12:15.858
Witness!

01:12:46.588 --> 01:12:47.659
[gun clicks]

01:12:48.930 --> 01:12:50.123
[grunts]

01:12:54.266 --> 01:12:56.032

01:12:56.168 --> 01:12:57.229
[yells]

01:12:58.403 --> 01:12:59.539
- [yells]
- No!

01:13:08.215 --> 01:13:09.274
[fierce grunt]

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:38.710
[automatic gunfire]

01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:11.941
[machine gun fire]

01:14:24.291 --> 01:14:25.757
[grunts, panting]

01:14:32.599 --> 01:14:34.392
[The Octoboss screams, growls]

01:14:35.961 --> 01:14:37.967
[motor whining]

01:14:45.538 --> 01:14:47.344
The Bommyknocker!
Do the Bommyknocker!

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:49.616
- Now?
- Now!

01:14:58.722 --> 01:15:00.290
[gunfire continues]

01:15:00.426 --> 01:15:01.694
[gun clicking]

01:15:29.785 --> 01:15:30.690
[lever thuds]

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:34.793
[Bommyknocker powers down]

01:15:57.316 --> 01:15:58.212
[grunts]

01:16:02.322 --> 01:16:03.415
Pull over.

01:16:04.892 --> 01:16:07.056
You're going to pull over
and get out.

01:16:09.922 --> 01:16:10.928
Stop!

01:16:11.594 --> 01:16:12.633
[yelps]

01:16:13.398 --> 01:16:14.734
[grunts]

01:16:24.103 --> 01:16:25.943
[panting hoarsely]

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:32.851
[screams]

01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:41.222
[panting]

01:17:20.267 --> 01:17:21.702
[Praetorian Jack] Where did
you think you were going?

01:17:28.811 --> 01:17:30.437
If you're running away
from the Citadel,

01:17:30.573 --> 01:17:33.443
believe me, the Bullet Farm
is a whole lot worse.

01:17:34.479 --> 01:17:37.608
The only other place is Gastown.
It's in the hands of Dementus.

01:17:37.743 --> 01:17:40.352
A mug who can't even
keep his gangs together.

01:17:40.921 --> 01:17:44.087
And that's it.
There is nowhere else.

01:17:44.789 --> 01:17:46.059
This is the Wasteland.

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:49.521
Wherever you thought
you were going does not exist.

01:17:54.601 --> 01:17:55.901
It's been a hard day.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:17:58.563
I lost my convoy.

01:17:59.472 --> 01:18:00.741
I lost my crew.

01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:03.678
I'm gonna have to start again.

01:18:06.148 --> 01:18:08.815
And I'm driving off thinking
I ought to start with you.

01:18:12.311 --> 01:18:13.951
You got good vision.

01:18:14.087 --> 01:18:15.783
You read the play
and you keep your head.

01:18:16.286 --> 01:18:17.819
You may be raw,
but you have about you

01:18:17.954 --> 01:18:19.617
a purposeful savagery.

01:18:21.121 --> 01:18:23.161
You give me time,

01:18:23.297 --> 01:18:25.856
I'll teach you everything
you need to know about Road War.

01:18:26.826 --> 01:18:29.867
If you survive everything
we take on together,

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:31.031
you'll have
all the skills you need

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:33.070
to get wherever you wanna go.

01:18:35.675 --> 01:18:37.173
No questions asked.

01:18:50.118 --> 01:18:52.056
Keep it. You'll need it.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:26.926
[mother] <i>The stars be with you.</i>

01:19:30.796 --> 01:19:32.558
<i>The stars be with you.</i>

01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:42.738
[Dementus] <i>You and me, Little D.</i>

01:19:42.873 --> 01:19:44.735
[gunshot echoing]

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.184
[men chanting and
clapping rhythmically]

01:20:04.895 --> 01:20:06.801
[all cheering]

01:20:08.098 --> 01:20:11.437
[all chanting] Immortan Joe!

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:13.434
[continuing, indistinct]

01:20:30.821 --> 01:20:32.585
[chanting fades]

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.031
[indistinct chatter, shouting]

01:20:47.470 --> 01:20:51.840
[War Boy] Two... four...
six... eight...

01:20:51.976 --> 01:20:53.507
Done. Tank's empty.

01:20:55.009 --> 01:20:56.649
Everything accounted, down to
the last drop of Mother's Milk.

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:59.346
- Good.
- No, it's not good.

01:20:59.481 --> 01:21:01.051
That piece of anus-pus,
Dementus,

01:21:01.186 --> 01:21:02.888
is running Gastown
into the ground

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.617
and blaming everyone
but himself.

01:21:04.752 --> 01:21:07.393
You tell Immortan Joe
we need a meeting.

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.129
A war meeting.

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:12.593
Otherwise we're gonna get
our tits caught in the wringer.

01:21:13.496 --> 01:21:15.826
Here's the boomstick
you asked for.

01:21:24.871 --> 01:21:27.244
[Furiosa] Thundersticks.
Bullets all loaded.

01:21:28.507 --> 01:21:30.511
[engine cranks, starts]

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.191
[War Boy shouting indistinctly]

01:21:46.027 --> 01:21:47.396
For you.

01:21:52.541 --> 01:21:53.974
For your travels.

01:21:55.335 --> 01:21:56.801
You're done here.

01:21:57.876 --> 01:21:59.243
You're free to go.

01:22:01.743 --> 01:22:05.953
Food, water, wheels,
whatever you need.

01:22:07.515 --> 01:22:09.418
I'll help you put it together.

01:22:11.551 --> 01:22:13.158
Give me a couple of days.

01:22:31.941 --> 01:22:32.870
[gasps]

01:22:33.713 --> 01:22:35.741
[panting]

01:22:58.366 --> 01:23:00.573
[warning horn blaring]

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.735
[machinery clanking]

01:23:04.975 --> 01:23:06.838
[gate rumbling]

01:23:12.619 --> 01:23:14.081
[coughs]

01:23:14.216 --> 01:23:15.649
We'll lead you in.

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:33.535
[gate hinges creaking]

01:23:35.635 --> 01:23:37.473
[crowds shouting, yelling]

01:24:01.297 --> 01:24:02.525
[indistinct shouting]

01:24:02.661 --> 01:24:05.336
Move! Hurry up! Come on!

01:24:08.403 --> 01:24:10.209
Back! Get out then!

01:24:10.975 --> 01:24:14.081
[gunshots]

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.890
[Dementus, over P.A.] <i>Stay back!</i>

01:24:26.025 --> 01:24:27.985
<i>Back! Stand back.</i>

01:24:30.624 --> 01:24:33.496
<i>Citizens of Gastown.</i>

01:24:33.631 --> 01:24:37.131
<i>I want what you want.
A full belly...</i>

01:24:37.701 --> 01:24:40.239
and a fistful of bullets
for a tank of gas.

01:24:42.174 --> 01:24:44.177
We have to put things right.

01:24:46.205 --> 01:24:49.215
And today, we're gonna
do something about it.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.255
Are you in charge here?

01:24:59.685 --> 01:25:01.051
You can speak to me.

01:25:01.586 --> 01:25:02.427
[Dementus] Yeah.

01:25:03.397 --> 01:25:05.462
Well, I've got a message
for Immortan Joe.

01:25:07.068 --> 01:25:09.361
We're in a black spiral here.

01:25:09.497 --> 01:25:11.767
We can't keep up supply.

01:25:11.903 --> 01:25:15.239
Everyone is saying they're being
swindled and short-changed.

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:16.605
Everyone is saying
it's my fault.

01:25:17.241 --> 01:25:18.706
It's everyone's fault.

01:25:20.114 --> 01:25:22.110
I want a meeting
of the warlords.

01:25:22.846 --> 01:25:26.649
Me, him, the People Eater,
that idiot Bullet Farmer.

01:25:26.784 --> 01:25:29.519
High noon at the Citadel.
Three days from now.

01:25:32.451 --> 01:25:33.418
Right.

01:25:33.554 --> 01:25:35.153
[crowd yelling angrily]

01:25:35.989 --> 01:25:37.021
- Ah, you better go.
- [dogs snarling]

01:25:38.565 --> 01:25:40.860
We're not leaving
without our tankers full of gas.

01:25:41.902 --> 01:25:42.961
[muffled boom]

01:25:43.902 --> 01:25:45.133
Go now.

01:25:45.269 --> 01:25:46.305
[explosions booming]

01:25:53.641 --> 01:25:55.215
[all shouting, indistinct]

01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.614
You wanna get out of here,
follow me.

01:26:03.417 --> 01:26:05.687
[engine roaring]

01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:17.567
[yelling]

01:26:37.255 --> 01:26:39.820
[crowd roaring angrily]

01:27:00.679 --> 01:27:03.580
High noon, the Citadel,
three days from now.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.483
Be punctual.

01:27:14.994 --> 01:27:16.923
[flies swarming]

01:27:39.184 --> 01:27:40.749
[sighs deeply]

01:27:44.417 --> 01:27:46.290
[People Eater] You give him
a full tank of water,

01:27:46.425 --> 01:27:48.821
and 2,000 tits of Mother's Milk

01:27:48.957 --> 01:27:51.831
and then you return
empty-handed.

01:27:51.967 --> 01:27:53.760
Not a drop of guzzolene.

01:27:53.896 --> 01:27:55.429
He filched us.
We're being filched.

01:27:55.565 --> 01:27:57.262
Let's kill him. Right now.

01:27:57.398 --> 01:27:59.731
Shoulda done it long ago, Dad.
Shoulda crushed him, Dad!

01:27:59.866 --> 01:28:01.232
Father, give me the War Rig.

01:28:01.367 --> 01:28:03.410
Load it up with all
of the firepower you've got,

01:28:03.545 --> 01:28:05.743
and I will blow him
from the face of the earth.

01:28:05.879 --> 01:28:07.771
[People Eater] How do we do that
before he blows up Gastown?

01:28:07.906 --> 01:28:08.973
We'll build it again.

01:28:09.108 --> 01:28:10.850
That'd take generations,
you moron.

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:12.517
We will build it again.

01:28:12.652 --> 01:28:15.111
Your way of thinking
is how he rooks us.

01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:16.347
He's got you scared
of his crazy.

01:28:16.483 --> 01:28:17.454
Bah!

01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:19.017
[Immortan Joe]
Here's what we do!

01:28:19.152 --> 01:28:21.150
We conserve every drop
of guzzolene,

01:28:21.286 --> 01:28:23.127
turn off all vehicles,
all generators.

01:28:23.263 --> 01:28:24.494
Turn off every water pump

01:28:24.630 --> 01:28:26.324
including the Big Four
Aquifer Siphons.

01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:27.497
Get.

01:28:27.633 --> 01:28:29.462
At first light, leave
for Bullet Farm

01:28:29.598 --> 01:28:31.932
with your tankers empty.

01:28:32.067 --> 01:28:36.068
Then, return with every munition
you can load.

01:28:37.403 --> 01:28:41.138
I want every bullet and firearm,
every caliber and size.

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:43.782
Your entire infantry
ready to pick up.

01:28:43.917 --> 01:28:44.749
Good.

01:28:45.652 --> 01:28:47.620
Come to the watchtower.
We'll signal them now.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:50.787
[Scrotus] Hell and Hall-elujah!
We're gonna take Gastown.

01:28:50.922 --> 01:28:52.855
[Rictus] Hit him! Hit him
when he least suspects it.

01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:55.758
[People Eater] How do we
stop him blowing up Gastown?

01:29:07.271 --> 01:29:08.936
[tools scraping]

01:29:21.688 --> 01:29:25.656
This place at the end
of your map of secrets.

01:29:27.588 --> 01:29:28.527
Where is it?

01:29:42.242 --> 01:29:43.267
My mother and father...

01:29:44.705 --> 01:29:46.072
...were soldiers.

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:49.582
Even as the world fell,

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:52.584
they yearned to be warriors
for a virtuous cause.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:56.951
For them, it never happened.

01:30:00.691 --> 01:30:02.429
I wanna help you
find this place.

01:30:04.495 --> 01:30:06.092
Wherever it may be.

01:30:33.589 --> 01:30:34.593
Come with me.

01:31:13.727 --> 01:31:14.567
[Furiosa] Ready?

01:31:17.138 --> 01:31:18.263
[horn blaring]

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:25.270
[hydraulics hissing]

01:31:28.044 --> 01:31:29.241
[Praetorian Jack]
I want your bikes.

01:31:29.376 --> 01:31:30.808
Load them on the back
of the V8 Pursuit

01:31:30.943 --> 01:31:32.112
and tie them down.

01:31:34.150 --> 01:31:36.015
- [War Boys shouting]
- Soon as that's done,

01:31:36.150 --> 01:31:38.157
load it with food,
fuel and water.

01:31:38.293 --> 01:31:39.891
As much as you can carry.

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:42.529
[War Boy] What's this?
A scouting party?

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:44.355
[Praetorian Jack] Possibly.

01:31:46.961 --> 01:31:48.295
[War Boy 2] What about us?

01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:50.134
[Praetorian Jack] You're both
gonna ride on the tanker.

01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:51.501
What about me?

01:31:51.637 --> 01:31:53.639
You're promoted. Rear defense.

01:31:54.607 --> 01:31:55.674
- On the War Rig?
- Of course.

01:31:57.872 --> 01:31:59.007
What are you doing?

01:32:00.776 --> 01:32:02.312
Is there a problem?

01:32:02.447 --> 01:32:03.649
You drive the V8.

01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:05.583
I drive the War Rig.

01:32:05.718 --> 01:32:07.983
Not today.
Today you drive Pursuit.

01:32:09.181 --> 01:32:10.082
[driver] What am I gonna do?

01:32:10.217 --> 01:32:10.949
[Praetorian Jack]
You're with me.

01:32:11.084 --> 01:32:12.582
- Up front?
- Up front.

01:32:12.717 --> 01:32:14.590
As soon as we load up
the weapons and munitions,

01:32:14.725 --> 01:32:16.655
you can drive the rig back.

01:32:17.325 --> 01:32:19.532
[driver] All the way home?
To the Citadel?

01:32:19.667 --> 01:32:21.331
- [Praetorian Jack] Yep.
- [driver laughs]

01:32:21.467 --> 01:32:22.265
[Praetorian Jack] Go on.

01:32:22.401 --> 01:32:23.361
[driver] Whoo!

01:32:24.404 --> 01:32:26.364
[truck engine starts]

01:32:33.742 --> 01:32:35.274
[horn honking]

01:32:37.176 --> 01:32:38.750
Wanna see what this can do?

01:32:39.518 --> 01:32:40.917
Hit the second engine.

01:32:42.488 --> 01:32:44.316
[engine ignites, starts]

01:32:45.492 --> 01:32:47.418
[driver whooping joyfully]

01:32:48.153 --> 01:32:50.025
[truck horn blaring]

01:33:33.408 --> 01:33:36.203
[truck hisses, falls silent]

01:33:43.383 --> 01:33:44.409
[horn blaring]

01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:48.655
[gunfire]

01:33:57.958 --> 01:33:58.797
[biker] All dead?

01:33:59.433 --> 01:34:00.260
[biker 2] Don't know.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.769
- [gunshot]
- [biker 3] Sniper ambush!

01:34:05.805 --> 01:34:07.598
[biker]
He's got backup. Outside.

01:34:08.267 --> 01:34:09.269
[biker 4] Between the tanks.

01:34:09.903 --> 01:34:10.941
[bullet clangs]

01:34:13.172 --> 01:34:14.307
[biker] I can't see him.

01:34:15.777 --> 01:34:16.881
[panting]

01:34:21.915 --> 01:34:22.689
[gunshot]

01:34:23.752 --> 01:34:24.856
[gunshot]

01:34:26.856 --> 01:34:27.661
[biker 5] Behind you.

01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:31.824
[body thuds]

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.132
[motorcycle approaching]

01:34:33.267 --> 01:34:34.294
[gunshot]

01:34:44.838 --> 01:34:45.778
[gasps]

01:34:57.115 --> 01:34:58.989
[motor revving]

01:35:16.442 --> 01:35:18.408
[panting deeply]

01:35:18.544 --> 01:35:19.807
[honking horn]

01:35:19.942 --> 01:35:21.748
[vehicles approaching]

01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:29.415
[flare gun clicks]

01:35:34.791 --> 01:35:36.554
[boom echoing]

01:35:47.969 --> 01:35:49.776
[engines roaring]

01:35:57.713 --> 01:35:58.818
[grunts]

01:36:12.697 --> 01:36:13.723
[shifts gears]

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:40.288
[panting deeply]

01:36:47.228 --> 01:36:48.494
[Dementus, faintly] Do not miss.

01:37:13.385 --> 01:37:14.927
[breathing hoarsely]

01:37:17.325 --> 01:37:18.689
- [bullet whistles]
- Whoo!

01:37:23.327 --> 01:37:24.530
[bullet hisses]

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:42.482
Where are they?
Can you see them?

01:37:44.117 --> 01:37:45.122
[bullet hisses]

01:37:46.257 --> 01:37:47.487
On the ridge,
to the left of the gate.

01:38:03.676 --> 01:38:05.274
[people screaming]

01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.606
Give me that.

01:38:18.023 --> 01:38:20.025
All right, load me up.
Come on.

01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:22.093
Come here.

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:29.364
[exclaiming]

01:38:38.072 --> 01:38:40.474
[rumbling]

01:39:20.081 --> 01:39:21.383
[powerful thud]

01:39:37.132 --> 01:39:38.796
[people screaming]

01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:45.979
Jack!

01:40:34.024 --> 01:40:35.655
Yeah? We're good.

01:41:10.525 --> 01:41:12.597
We'll head east for three days.

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.531
Once we clear the escarpment
and the great salt plains,

01:41:15.666 --> 01:41:17.895
we'll take the bikes
over the dunes all the way.

01:41:19.233 --> 01:41:20.535
All the way.

01:41:41.723 --> 01:41:43.692
The digger.
Let's use the digger.

01:41:43.828 --> 01:41:44.922
No time.

01:41:47.898 --> 01:41:48.629
Out.

01:42:15.454 --> 01:42:16.492
[growling]

01:43:43.212 --> 01:43:45.218
[engine roaring]

01:44:16.840 --> 01:44:18.977
Fang it! Fang it!

01:44:46.407 --> 01:44:47.742
[screams]

01:45:00.818 --> 01:45:03.252
[sound fades]

01:45:09.596 --> 01:45:11.469
[engine shuts off]

01:45:15.108 --> 01:45:17.310
[grunting with effort]

01:45:24.818 --> 01:45:25.483
Hello?

01:45:26.886 --> 01:45:27.947
Heh?

01:45:39.726 --> 01:45:41.701
[motorbikes approaching]

01:45:41.836 --> 01:45:43.336
[grunting]

01:45:51.605 --> 01:45:53.478
[bikers cheering]

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:00.819
[man] This one's still alive!

01:46:00.954 --> 01:46:01.717
[Dementus] Good.

01:46:04.783 --> 01:46:06.359
[Furiosa gasping]

01:46:08.755 --> 01:46:09.890
[man 2] Get up here.

01:46:10.757 --> 01:46:11.991
Come on, get up here.

01:46:14.463 --> 01:46:16.730
Did you see that?

01:46:16.866 --> 01:46:18.200
You see how they fought
for each other,

01:46:18.336 --> 01:46:20.230
this little army of two?

01:46:21.673 --> 01:46:24.168
Where were they going,
so full of hope?

01:46:25.408 --> 01:46:27.405
There is no hope!

01:46:28.374 --> 01:46:31.015
Not for them, not for you!
Certainly not for me!

01:46:31.151 --> 01:46:33.080
[biker whimpers, yelps]

01:46:33.215 --> 01:46:36.422
The day I acquire Bullet Farm,
these two destroy it.

01:46:37.854 --> 01:46:39.788
I had Gastown,
I had Bullet Farm.

01:46:39.923 --> 01:46:41.391
With that,
I coulda crippled the Citadel.

01:46:41.526 --> 01:46:43.429
- Jack.
- Ruled the Wasteland!

01:46:43.564 --> 01:46:45.055
- The Wasteland woulda been...
- My Jack.

01:46:45.191 --> 01:46:45.887
...a far better place
for all of us.

01:46:46.023 --> 01:46:46.855
[Praetorian Jack] Fury.

01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:48.401
- Jack.
- No!

01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:52.730
[man 2] Get up.

01:46:52.866 --> 01:46:54.401
[voice strained] You two.

01:46:54.537 --> 01:46:56.975
You two break my heart.

01:46:57.111 --> 01:46:58.367
You break my heart.

01:46:59.608 --> 01:47:00.743
And that's not fair.

01:47:02.206 --> 01:47:05.583
You make me the Dark Dementus.

01:47:06.786 --> 01:47:09.920
The Dark Dementus
cannot afford to be soft!

01:47:10.723 --> 01:47:13.483
It's the price I pay
to be your leader!

01:47:13.619 --> 01:47:16.390
It's the price we all pay
to survive in the Wasteland.

01:47:16.525 --> 01:47:18.794
We cannot be soft!

01:47:21.367 --> 01:47:23.095
There must be retribution.

01:47:25.205 --> 01:47:27.869
Justice and retribution.

01:47:29.571 --> 01:47:31.543
[motors starting]

01:47:37.710 --> 01:47:39.309
[cackling]

01:47:43.917 --> 01:47:44.754
[Dementus] Hey, hey, hey!

01:47:46.583 --> 01:47:49.419
I want her to watch a while.
String her up.

01:47:50.455 --> 01:47:54.163
You're going. You're going.
You're going.

01:47:54.298 --> 01:47:55.127
[man] Let's go.

01:48:03.034 --> 01:48:04.510
No, mate, other arm.

01:48:07.105 --> 01:48:09.944
What? You lost your touch?

01:48:11.644 --> 01:48:12.749
[growls]

01:48:13.913 --> 01:48:14.916
[Mr. Norton] I'll do it.

01:48:17.952 --> 01:48:19.822
- [winch whirring]
- [gasps]

01:48:38.546 --> 01:48:41.679
[biker] Come on, piggy!
Get up. Get up!

01:48:57.791 --> 01:48:58.921
Let's go. Go.

01:48:59.057 --> 01:49:00.929
[growling, barking]

01:50:01.193 --> 01:50:02.353
Smeg!

01:50:09.997 --> 01:50:11.802
[amplified] Enough! Enough!

01:50:13.197 --> 01:50:14.398
[quietly] I'm bored.

01:50:16.201 --> 01:50:18.204
Let's end our cares and go home!

01:50:45.339 --> 01:50:47.270
[shouting, indistinct]

01:50:47.405 --> 01:50:49.433
[engine roaring]

01:50:50.573 --> 01:50:51.776
[metal breaking]

01:51:06.919 --> 01:51:08.793
[motor revving]

01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:40.693
[panting heavily]

01:51:52.803 --> 01:51:54.630
[ravens crying in distance]

01:52:12.292 --> 01:52:14.155
[flies buzzing]

01:52:36.109 --> 01:52:37.911
[gasping violently]

01:52:38.046 --> 01:52:39.413
[old woman] It's all right.

01:52:40.416 --> 01:52:43.382
Go back to sleep.
I'll make it nice for you.

01:52:45.852 --> 01:52:46.759
Stay!

01:52:48.055 --> 01:52:49.894
You'll find peace here.

01:52:52.861 --> 01:52:54.261
[people shouting]

01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.800
[yelling]

01:52:58.935 --> 01:53:00.465
I'm the Praetorian Furiosa.

01:53:01.803 --> 01:53:02.672
[angry yell]

01:53:02.807 --> 01:53:04.909
I am the Praetorian Furiosa!

01:53:05.710 --> 01:53:06.911
What happened to you?

01:53:07.412 --> 01:53:08.473
Pull.

01:53:17.591 --> 01:53:19.147
[Bullet Farmer] Any sign of him?

01:53:19.282 --> 01:53:20.124
[Rictus] No.

01:53:21.093 --> 01:53:22.828
But there's something going on
at Gastown.

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.187
I think he's blowing up Gastown.

01:53:25.323 --> 01:53:26.664
[Bullet Farmer] Rubbish.

01:53:26.799 --> 01:53:27.965
- Take a look.
- [growls]

01:53:29.533 --> 01:53:32.728
[People Eater] He fails to turn
up to a meeting and now this.

01:53:35.741 --> 01:53:36.998
[Immortan Joe] It's fake.

01:53:37.601 --> 01:53:39.301
There's no possible advantage.

01:53:39.437 --> 01:53:40.937
We shouldn't have waited.

01:53:41.806 --> 01:53:44.516
Why're we waiting now?
Let's go to Gastown now.

01:53:44.652 --> 01:53:45.917
[Furiosa] He's not at Gastown.

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:50.647
[Bullet Farmer]
Where's Praetorian Jack?

01:53:51.954 --> 01:53:53.187
Where's our War Rig?

01:53:53.323 --> 01:53:54.457
[Furiosa]
He's taken the Bullet Farm.

01:53:54.593 --> 01:53:55.518
You're lying.

01:53:55.654 --> 01:53:56.659
[Furiosa] He's taken
the Bullet Farm,

01:53:56.795 --> 01:53:58.287
and he's coming here next.

01:53:58.422 --> 01:53:59.855
How do you know that?

01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:02.160
They're coming with
grappling hooks and ladders.

01:54:02.296 --> 01:54:03.968
He wants to take the Citadel.

01:54:04.103 --> 01:54:05.427
[Bullet Farmer]
Then we go to the Bullet Farm.

01:54:05.562 --> 01:54:07.136
Meet him head-on right now.

01:54:07.271 --> 01:54:09.640
It's Gastown that's burning.
He's at Gastown.

01:54:09.775 --> 01:54:11.943
He wants to draw you to Gastown.

01:54:12.078 --> 01:54:14.103
He wants you to leave
the Citadel exposed.

01:54:14.238 --> 01:54:15.611
So we stay here.

01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:19.215
We have three choices.
The coward's choice.

01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:22.046
Stay here and let Dementus
mess with our minds.

01:54:22.181 --> 01:54:23.348
The fool's choice,

01:54:23.483 --> 01:54:24.887
go out and meet
an invisible enemy

01:54:25.022 --> 01:54:26.882
on the road to the Bullet Farm.

01:54:27.017 --> 01:54:30.519
Or the warrior's choice,
go to Gastown and crush him.

01:54:30.654 --> 01:54:32.259
[Immortan Joe] It is my choice.

01:54:32.395 --> 01:54:34.328
We make him think
we're going to Gastown.

01:54:34.994 --> 01:54:36.429
[growls]

01:54:37.528 --> 01:54:39.234
If you find him, he's mine.

01:55:04.563 --> 01:55:05.898
Yes. Yes!

01:55:08.761 --> 01:55:10.562
[Smeg] They're Gastown bound
for sure.

01:55:16.874 --> 01:55:18.099
[Dementus] So gullible.

01:55:18.902 --> 01:55:20.979
I hold them profoundly
in contempt.

01:55:31.717 --> 01:55:35.025
Gentlemans, it's time.
Time to do war.

01:55:35.161 --> 01:55:37.626
Time to take back
what's rightfully ours.

01:55:37.761 --> 01:55:39.188
To the Citadel.

01:55:39.323 --> 01:55:41.223
Let's party!

01:55:41.358 --> 01:55:43.727
[bikers roaring]

01:56:02.016 --> 01:56:03.780
[gears whirring]

01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:38.347
[History Man]
<i>There always was, is,</i>

01:56:38.483 --> 01:56:40.520
<i>and will be war.</i>

01:56:43.126 --> 01:56:45.030
<i>The Sumerian fought the Elamite.</i>

01:56:46.097 --> 01:56:48.165
<i>The Saxon fought the Viking.</i>

01:56:49.837 --> 01:56:51.762
<i>And so the histories grew.</i>

01:56:52.931 --> 01:56:54.902
<i>There were the Wars
of the Roses,</i>

01:56:55.037 --> 01:56:56.206
<i>The Oranges.</i>

01:56:56.973 --> 01:56:58.670
<i>The Opium Wars.</i>

01:57:00.478 --> 01:57:04.643
<i>The One-Day, Six-Day,
Thousand-Day Wars.</i>

01:57:07.881 --> 01:57:11.716
<i>North against South.
East against West.</i>

01:57:15.790 --> 01:57:20.395
<i>The first, second,
third countless wars</i>

01:57:20.530 --> 01:57:22.595
<i>of religion
and righteous belief.</i>

01:57:26.830 --> 01:57:30.072
<i>The Oil Wars. Water Wars.</i>

01:57:30.207 --> 01:57:32.110
<i>The Tri-Nation Nuclear War.</i>

01:57:33.507 --> 01:57:35.839
<i>The Battle of the Boomtowns.</i>

01:57:37.279 --> 01:57:39.084
<i>And now, my dears...</i>

01:57:40.381 --> 01:57:42.879
<i>...The Forty-Day Wasteland War.</i>

01:58:01.466 --> 01:58:03.603
<i>Eyes for eyes.</i>

01:58:04.668 --> 01:58:06.672
<i>Teeth for teeth.</i>

01:58:09.476 --> 01:58:12.117
<i>Rage fueled by grief.</i>

01:58:36.404 --> 01:58:37.406
[Furiosa] I need a vehicle.

01:58:38.905 --> 01:58:40.444
There's nothing here,
not even a bike.

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:43.071
- [Furiosa] Winch me down.
- What're you gonna do? Walk?

01:58:47.315 --> 01:58:48.813
I've got a vehicle.

01:58:58.625 --> 01:59:00.495
Can't wait for you to see it.

01:59:07.335 --> 01:59:08.998
Isn't she wonderful?

01:59:13.845 --> 01:59:15.180
[chuckles]

02:00:08.967 --> 02:00:10.059
[stops engine]

02:00:22.642 --> 02:00:24.249
[War Boy] Hey! Look at this.

02:00:25.678 --> 02:00:27.219
I think this one might fit.

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:31.014
[Scrotus] Try it on! Try it on!

02:00:34.620 --> 02:00:36.250
Every moment wasted,

02:00:36.386 --> 02:00:39.055
that mongrel gets
farther and farther away.

02:00:39.658 --> 02:00:40.694
[War Boy] Coming up!

02:00:42.367 --> 02:00:43.896
[Scrotus]
And I want her fuel too.

02:00:44.032 --> 02:00:47.195
I want all of her fuel,
and her water and her weapon.

02:00:48.736 --> 02:00:51.573
A fool can run,
but he can't hide.

02:00:54.704 --> 02:00:55.379
It's gonna fit.

02:00:56.874 --> 02:00:58.244
[Organic Mechanic] Hey, Scrotus.

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:00.084
- Scrotus!
- What?

02:01:00.219 --> 02:01:02.384
You'll need some proper tucker.

02:01:02.519 --> 02:01:04.253
- Canine kebab.
- [dismissive growl]

02:01:04.388 --> 02:01:05.581
[Rictus] We'll take it with us.

02:01:05.717 --> 02:01:06.824
What do you mean, "us?"

02:01:06.960 --> 02:01:08.118
I'm coming with you.

02:01:08.253 --> 02:01:09.824
[Scrotus] No, you're not.
You'll slow me down.

02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.995
[Rictus] I'm gonna make sure
that dumb Dementus is dead.

02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:12.954
[Scrotus] No, you're not!

02:01:13.089 --> 02:01:14.490
You stay here and eat some dog.

02:01:14.625 --> 02:01:16.664
[engine roaring]

02:01:26.804 --> 02:01:28.236
[Scrotus] What was that?

02:01:28.372 --> 02:01:31.745
[History Man]
That is the darkest of angels.

02:01:32.714 --> 02:01:35.177
The fifth Rider
of the Apocalypse.

02:01:50.927 --> 02:01:52.799
[bullet whistles, thuds]

02:01:54.698 --> 02:01:56.000
[bullet strikes]

02:02:08.822 --> 02:02:11.587
[panting]

02:02:25.939 --> 02:02:26.761
Who are they?

02:02:27.497 --> 02:02:30.305
Someone competent
and excessively resentful.

02:02:30.441 --> 02:02:31.667
Who do you suppose they want?

02:02:31.803 --> 02:02:33.301
Me, without my crew.

02:02:34.675 --> 02:02:36.508
We'll wait here. Ambush him.

02:02:36.644 --> 02:02:37.745
[Big Jilly] Let's go back.

02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:39.307
[Dementus] No, no, no.
We have to split up.

02:02:40.109 --> 02:02:42.044
Here, no time for long goodbyes.

02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:43.544
We've done some
mighty things together.

02:02:43.680 --> 02:02:44.620
Goodbye.

02:02:56.694 --> 02:02:58.227
[squawking]

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:35.066
[engine revs]

02:04:22.913 --> 02:04:24.049
I'm not Dementus!

02:04:27.687 --> 02:04:29.461
We swapped bikes!

02:04:48.905 --> 02:04:50.812
[panicked shout]

02:05:44.367 --> 02:05:46.329
[faint cheering]

02:05:59.316 --> 02:06:01.212
[wind whistling]

02:06:14.300 --> 02:06:16.425
[takes deep breath]

02:06:56.208 --> 02:06:58.775
[panting]

02:07:07.285 --> 02:07:08.510
You've found me.

02:07:11.322 --> 02:07:12.580
Freakish.

02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:15.154
You are a freak.

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:20.993
You could have necked me
in the night, but you didn't.

02:07:21.128 --> 02:07:23.668
So, you must be
that other thing.

02:07:24.766 --> 02:07:26.594
Are you that thing?

02:07:32.102 --> 02:07:33.436
[exhales sharply]

02:07:48.590 --> 02:07:50.959
[panting]

02:08:14.078 --> 02:08:15.951
[panting heavily]

02:08:42.546 --> 02:08:43.814
[gun clatters]

02:09:03.766 --> 02:09:05.600
[motor switches off]

02:09:05.736 --> 02:09:07.266
[Dementus] I have nothing.

02:09:08.770 --> 02:09:10.097
I am nothing.

02:09:10.233 --> 02:09:11.802
[door closes]

02:09:11.937 --> 02:09:12.909
I'm yours.

02:09:20.342 --> 02:09:22.215
[chains jingling]

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:35.657
[Furiosa] Remember me?

02:09:49.405 --> 02:09:51.981
You fabulous thing.

02:09:55.118 --> 02:09:57.783
You crawled
out of a pitiless grave,

02:09:57.918 --> 02:09:59.285
deeper than Hell.

02:10:00.553 --> 02:10:02.524
And only one thing's
gonna do that for you.

02:10:02.660 --> 02:10:04.422
And not hope. Hate.

02:10:06.762 --> 02:10:08.491
No shame in hate.

02:10:08.627 --> 02:10:10.725
It's one of the great forces
of nature.

02:10:15.138 --> 02:10:16.841
That wasn't hope,
that was instinct.

02:10:19.875 --> 02:10:20.977
[water drop splashes]

02:10:21.940 --> 02:10:23.243
[splash]

02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:27.478
[splash]

02:10:32.082 --> 02:10:32.923
So...

02:10:34.627 --> 02:10:36.423
...this is the day I die.

02:10:37.159 --> 02:10:38.621
I've always wondered how--
[chokes]

02:10:42.759 --> 02:10:45.030
Fifteen years ago
there was a woman.

02:10:45.165 --> 02:10:46.964
Oh, so there's more to this.

02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:48.433
Do you remember her?

02:10:49.265 --> 02:10:50.600
Do I get a clue?

02:10:56.108 --> 02:10:58.482
Right, okay. Um...

02:10:58.617 --> 02:11:00.546
Redhead. Even her pu--

02:11:00.682 --> 02:11:01.611
[grunts]

02:11:03.821 --> 02:11:06.821
Was she your mother? Sister?

02:11:06.956 --> 02:11:08.984
Did she beg, did she scream?

02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:11.753
The ones who yell the least tend
to stick in my mind. [groaning]

02:11:12.859 --> 02:11:13.929
[coughs]

02:11:14.064 --> 02:11:15.256
Despite everything
you did to her,

02:11:15.392 --> 02:11:16.862
she was magnificent.

02:11:16.998 --> 02:11:17.869
Oh, you were there.

02:11:19.305 --> 02:11:20.668
[groans]

02:11:20.804 --> 02:11:23.402
My childhood. My mother.

02:11:24.576 --> 02:11:25.734
I want them back.

02:11:26.644 --> 02:11:27.543
Of course you do.

02:11:27.678 --> 02:11:29.106
I want them back!

02:11:29.242 --> 02:11:30.578
That's exactly how I felt.

02:11:31.314 --> 02:11:34.013
My own family.
My own magnificent beauties.

02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:36.712
Taken so unjustly. Immutably.

02:11:36.847 --> 02:11:38.780
I'm right there,
I'm right there with you.

02:11:41.257 --> 02:11:43.791
I too craved nothing
but revenge.

02:11:43.927 --> 02:11:45.626
A big bellyful of revenge.

02:11:45.761 --> 02:11:47.288
[gun clicks]

02:11:47.424 --> 02:11:49.395
[growls] If I may...

02:11:51.003 --> 02:11:52.470
If the shooter goes
around the back,

02:11:52.605 --> 02:11:53.562
the shootee won't know

02:11:53.698 --> 02:11:56.039
the precise moment
of the execution.

02:11:57.934 --> 02:12:00.302
Minor torture,
but every little bit counts.

02:12:00.438 --> 02:12:01.572
Either way, that rat shot

02:12:01.708 --> 02:12:03.772
will turn my brain
into a pink mist so fast,

02:12:03.907 --> 02:12:05.642
I won't even hear
the sound of the gun.

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.046
I'll hear it.

02:12:08.549 --> 02:12:09.785
I'll hear it for the rest
of my days.

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:10.953
[Dementus] Of course you will.

02:12:11.089 --> 02:12:12.719
I'll feel the kickback
in my hand.

02:12:12.854 --> 02:12:13.749
[Dementus] Sure.

02:12:15.551 --> 02:12:17.759
I'll remember your face.

02:12:17.895 --> 02:12:19.896
As the slug worms its way

02:12:20.032 --> 02:12:21.625
into the soft matter
of your brain,

02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:23.759
taking with it what you call
your reason.

02:12:24.701 --> 02:12:25.937
And your memory,

02:12:27.272 --> 02:12:29.637
from which my mother
will fortunately be absent.

02:12:29.772 --> 02:12:30.738
Brilliant.

02:12:31.341 --> 02:12:33.373
I'll be dead and you'll
still be sorrowing

02:12:33.508 --> 02:12:35.980
your lovey-dovey and
your mommy magnificent.

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:37.874
You idiot.

02:12:38.009 --> 02:12:40.215
You can never balance
the scales of their suffering.

02:12:42.114 --> 02:12:42.910
[groans softly]

02:12:43.746 --> 02:12:46.815
- Give them back.
- I can't!

02:12:48.127 --> 02:12:50.417
What you want, dear,
are my cries of anguish.

02:12:50.553 --> 02:12:52.160
Anguish without end.

02:12:52.296 --> 02:12:54.460
And if I could give you that,
I would.

02:12:54.595 --> 02:12:56.764
But I don't fear
the loss of bliss in Heaven.

02:12:56.900 --> 02:12:59.168
Or retribution in Hell.

02:12:59.303 --> 02:13:01.169
And I've got a fiendishly high
pain threshold.

02:13:01.305 --> 02:13:03.231
- [Furiosa shrieks]
- Again, do it again.

02:13:03.366 --> 02:13:05.240
[yells, panting]

02:13:09.245 --> 02:13:11.912
[panting] If you
can't do me quick,

02:13:12.048 --> 02:13:13.316
you'll have to do me slow.

02:13:13.452 --> 02:13:14.978
[spits]

02:13:15.113 --> 02:13:18.851
But you are never going to get
anything close to what you want.

02:13:18.986 --> 02:13:21.025
[grunting]

02:13:33.365 --> 02:13:34.830
[gun hits the sand]

02:13:38.139 --> 02:13:40.011
[tiny motor running]

02:14:15.713 --> 02:14:17.312
Little D?

02:14:21.115 --> 02:14:23.545
[laughing weakly]

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:26.321
I have been waiting for you.

02:14:26.456 --> 02:14:29.154
I've been waiting
for someone like you,

02:14:29.289 --> 02:14:32.087
someone worthy of me.

02:14:33.023 --> 02:14:36.926
No honor, no rule of law
to sort things out.

02:14:37.061 --> 02:14:40.269
Just two evil bastards
out here in the Wasteland.

02:14:41.735 --> 02:14:45.173
You do this, you do this right,
you become me.

02:14:45.309 --> 02:14:47.841
- I am nothing like you.
- You are me.

02:14:47.977 --> 02:14:49.738
Already dead.

02:14:49.874 --> 02:14:51.875
To feel alive,
we seek sensation.

02:14:52.010 --> 02:14:55.483
Any sensation to wash away
the cranky black sorrow.

02:14:56.653 --> 02:14:59.252
And it leaves us for a moment,
but then it comes back,

02:14:59.387 --> 02:15:00.690
and we have to do it all again.

02:15:00.825 --> 02:15:02.249
And we need more,

02:15:02.385 --> 02:15:04.962
and each time we need more
until too much is never enough.

02:15:05.097 --> 02:15:08.561
We are the already dead,
Little D.

02:15:09.492 --> 02:15:11.399
[panting]

02:15:12.528 --> 02:15:13.764
You and me.

02:15:19.711 --> 02:15:21.479
[rumbling groan]

02:15:21.614 --> 02:15:23.614
[wheezing]

02:15:23.749 --> 02:15:25.072
The question is...

02:15:28.154 --> 02:15:30.913
...do you have it in you
to make it epic?

02:15:51.101 --> 02:15:52.375
[History Man]
<i>She took away his voice,</i>

02:15:52.511 --> 02:15:55.806
<i>and they spent the rest
of the day in silence.</i>

02:15:58.281 --> 02:15:59.711
<i>There are those who prefer</i>

02:15:59.846 --> 02:16:02.010
<i>that she did
more than shoot him.</i>

02:16:05.449 --> 02:16:10.161
<i>They claim that she ended him
in ways more fitting.</i>

02:16:13.630 --> 02:16:15.623
<i>They tell
of righteous perversities</i>

02:16:15.758 --> 02:16:18.059
<i>and witty mutilations.</i>

02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:26.804
<i>But this is the truth whispered
to me by Furiosa herself.</i>

02:16:28.772 --> 02:16:30.841
<i>Deep in the Citadel,</i>

02:16:30.976 --> 02:16:34.185
<i>high up
in the hydroponic gardens,</i>

02:16:35.354 --> 02:16:38.315
<i>there is a tree
unlike any other.</i>

02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:40.323
[wheezing breaths]

02:16:42.659 --> 02:16:46.857
<i>Its soil is human.
Its nutrients human.</i>

02:16:48.093 --> 02:16:51.158
<i>Maggots debriding
his necrotic flesh.</i>

02:16:52.768 --> 02:16:56.537
<i>It was an echo
growing out of a living being.</i>

02:17:03.976 --> 02:17:06.016
[Furiosa]
<i>This is our first fruit,</i>

02:17:06.151 --> 02:17:07.945
<i>but it's not for you and me.</i>

02:17:09.315 --> 02:17:12.823
<i>Each of us in our own way
will vanish from this Earth.</i>

02:17:12.959 --> 02:17:14.357
<i>And then perhaps...</i>

02:17:15.726 --> 02:17:18.757
<i>...some uncorrupted life
will rise to adorn it.</i>

02:17:41.578 --> 02:17:43.078
[thud, echoing]
