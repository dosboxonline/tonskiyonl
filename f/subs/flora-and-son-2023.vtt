WEBVTT

02:00.954 --> 02:01.955
I'm Kev.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.124
Flora.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.543
I'm gonna be riding you later.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.086
No, you won't.

02:19.932 --> 02:24.061
- Hi, how are you?
- Flora. How are ya?

02:24.061 --> 02:25.395
I'm good.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.351
Good girl, Flora.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.021
- Mornin'.
- Oh, fuck.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.774
Told ya.
Do you go to Shifters much, love, yeah?

03:11.400 --> 03:14.736
Yeah, all me life. Great club.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.116
Listen,
will I whip us up something for breakfast?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.994
A little fry maybe, you know?
Where's the fridge?

03:22.494 --> 03:24.997
There's nothing in it. Me son eats it all.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.416
There's a son?

03:28.208 --> 03:29.209
Yeah.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.962
- Where is he?
- Don't know.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.631
Supposed to be in school.
Could be anywhere.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.428
I told you all about this last night,
in the taxi?

03:39.428 --> 03:40.888
You said you were cool with that?

03:41.638 --> 03:43.348
Shut the door on the way out.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.439
Have you committed any antisocial behavior

03:50.439 --> 03:53.358
- in the last few months of your life?
- No way, Guard.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.069
Have you received any stolen goods
to the best of your knowledge?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.779
Absolutely not, Guard.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.117
Have you stolen any goods?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.036
Not that I got caught with.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.748
- Answer him properly, you fucking idiot.
- Fuck.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.833
- How did you get the black eye?
- Fighting.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.295
Did you never think
of joining the boxing club, Max?

04:13.795 --> 04:17.257
No. They only wanted me to clean up,
mop spit off the floor.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.676
- I'm not doing that.
- That's how Rocky started.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.764
They have a new cycling group
in Mount Vernon.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.682
Don't have a bike.

04:25.682 --> 04:28.769
He sold it for a secondhand laptop
so he could play video games.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.854
That's not all I do on it.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.232
Watch pornography on it too.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.487
The Juvenile Liaison program
is designed to keep young people

04:38.487 --> 04:40.948
out of the court system,
and so out of prison.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.285
And we all know what they do
to pretty young lads like you in prison.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.498
They anally rape them, Max.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.292
We'll leave it there, son.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.795
But I'm warning you now,
you're headed in that direction

04:54.795 --> 04:57.089
with a string of offenses
the length of me arm.

04:57.089 --> 04:59.174
One more offense
and you'll be behind bars.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.552
Flora, find him something to do.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.971
Something to keep
those light fingers occupied, yeah?

05:14.982 --> 05:17.067
Yikes. Look at you,
you big chocolate head.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.986
Oh, yeah, sorry.
She found some in the kitchen.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.320
No worries.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.907
- How was your workout?
- Amazing. How am I doing?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.244
- You look amazing.
- Yay.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.912
Okay, Flora, you're free to go. Thanks.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.414
Right. Here's your baby.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.083
Thanks so much, Aishling.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.129
See ya, Sorcha. See you Monday.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.385
- Bye now!
- Thanks again!

05:43.385 --> 05:45.179
No, thanking you!

06:05.866 --> 06:06.909
Come here.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.370
- Yeah, all right.
- You ready?

06:27.930 --> 06:29.431
How much to fix this guitar up?

06:35.020 --> 06:36.021
Let me see--

06:36.647 --> 06:42.027
Tighten the truss rod, a set of strings,
two new machine heads.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.404
- Sixty euro?
- Fuck off.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.489
Eighteen euro.

06:46.823 --> 06:47.824
Do it.

07:02.965 --> 07:03.966
Hiya.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.218
What's that?

07:07.386 --> 07:08.387
It's a piano.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.056
Whose is it?

07:11.974 --> 07:14.142
Wait, now, how many kids do I have?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.478
Well, let's see. One?

07:17.271 --> 07:18.438
It's yours.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.523
Where'd you get it?

07:20.023 --> 07:23.026
Who cares where it came from?
It's a guitar. It makes music.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.820
You used to be dead into music.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.029
Happy birthday.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.240
You fucking robbed it
from one of the houses, didn't you?

07:28.240 --> 07:30.576
No, I didn't rob it. Play it.

07:30.576 --> 07:32.411
- Don't want to play.
- Why not?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.872
- Since when am I a guitarist?
- Since now!

07:34.872 --> 07:37.666
- Jesus. You didn't even buy it for me.
- How do you know? Maybe I did.

07:37.666 --> 07:39.001
Well, did ya?

07:39.001 --> 07:41.003
No. But why does that matter?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.422
Me whole life, you never get me anything.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.883
Then you come home
with this dusty piece of shit

07:45.883 --> 07:46.967
the day after me birthday,

07:46.967 --> 07:49.261
and expect me
to turn into Ed fucking Sheeran?

07:49.261 --> 07:50.846
- It's a gift. Who cares?
- I don't want it.

07:50.846 --> 07:53.807
- It's a crock of fucking shit.
- You ungrateful prick.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.226
And you're a daft slag
who never gave anyone anything.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.856
Don't talk to me like that,
you little prick.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.774
Cunt.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.569
You came out of my cunt,
you ungrateful little animal.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.447
One day I'm gonna surprise you
and smash into your fucking face!

08:08.447 --> 08:09.823
You'll be behind bars before that!

08:09.823 --> 08:11.408
- Good. Away from you!
- Go on!

08:11.408 --> 08:12.951
Go back to your da!

08:23.170 --> 08:25.422
You forgot your fucking present.

09:01.917 --> 09:02.918
Hey, Da.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.170
Come here, little man.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.508
I'm in the Lamborghini.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.597
- Flora.
- Ian.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.975
Heard about the guitar episode.

09:18.851 --> 09:21.103
So you had a little Harry Styles
on your hands, was it?

09:21.687 --> 09:24.565
Who knows what he could be?
I mean, look at the genes.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.817
It's not about the genes.
It's about dreams.

09:27.693 --> 09:30.779
I gave up my musical dreams for him.
And you. You're welcome.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.281
Here we go.

09:33.323 --> 09:36.201
You do know we were on the same billing
as Snow Patrol the night you and I met?

09:36.702 --> 09:38.579
Course I did. It's why I fucked ya.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.665
To think where I could be now,
if things hadda been different.

09:41.665 --> 09:45.169
Mountjoy, Portlaoise, Cloverhill.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.045
Pick a prison.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.130
Very funny.

09:48.672 --> 09:51.425
Go on, you'd better go.
They'll clamp your fucking broomstick.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.677
Anyway, I might learn the guitar meself.

09:59.308 --> 10:00.184
Okay.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.019
Could be you're not the only genius
in this family.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.607
Sorry, but you playing the guitar?
That's just too funny.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.318
- Why?
- 'Cause it takes dedication,

10:09.318 --> 10:11.862
years of practice, sweat, commitment.

10:12.738 --> 10:16.575
It's not just an overnight transformation
on some fucking reality TV show.

10:17.159 --> 10:19.036
Took 20 years to build up them calluses.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.665
Are you really gonna talk to me
about commitment?

10:25.667 --> 10:26.960
Where is she?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.213
At a nail bar, getting a manicure?

10:30.172 --> 10:31.840
Or at the surgery,
getting a Brazilian arse lift?

10:31.840 --> 10:32.966
She doesn't need one, love.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.719
You're disgusting.

10:37.679 --> 10:40.933
And don't just sit on the couch
smoking weed and playing video games.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.687
And her arse isn't that amazing!

10:46.688 --> 10:48.148
Just FYI!

10:55.989 --> 10:57.032
Hey.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.326
- Flora.
- Juanita.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.621
- Awkward.
- Not for me.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.540
I've been there. You're welcome to him.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.668
Thanks. See ya.

11:08.252 --> 11:09.253
<i>Hasta luego.</i>

11:14.174 --> 11:15.175
Fucking hell.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.638
I can't go on like this.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.474
Okay. Let's go.

11:22.474 --> 11:23.851
No. I mean, in life.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.728
This can't be my story.

11:28.272 --> 11:30.357
Living in a shoebox
with a kid who hates me,

11:30.357 --> 11:33.360
and his da who doesn't see me.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.197
This can't be my narrative.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.324
He rejected your prezzie. So what?

11:39.825 --> 11:43.370
You didn't even buy it, in fairness,
and you forgot his birthday.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.830
But you are a great mother.

11:44.830 --> 11:45.914
Am I?

11:47.791 --> 11:51.753
I watch those news stories
about kids gone missing and police hunts,

11:52.921 --> 11:54.464
and I feel for those parents.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.553
But sometimes,
I wouldn't mind that so much.

12:01.430 --> 12:04.057
I wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to him, but sometimes,

12:04.057 --> 12:08.520
I'd love to come home
and he just wasn't there.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.775
Okay, I take it back.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.861
You are a fucking psycho. I gotta go.

12:17.821 --> 12:19.281
See ya in Shifters later?

12:19.281 --> 12:20.991
Have I ever said no to that question?

12:21.992 --> 12:23.952
See, there's something to look forward to.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.414
See ya, Flora.

12:50.604 --> 12:55.943
<i>That smoky voice-- That is one heck
of a little vehicle you have there.</i>

12:55.943 --> 13:01.532
<i>You are sparkling like
the diamond we always knew you were.</i>

13:01.532 --> 13:04.785
<i>Just watching you sell
the emotion of the song</i>

13:04.785 --> 13:08.956
<i>is one of the most impressive things
I've seen since I've been judging.</i>

13:08.956 --> 13:10.040
<i>Tremendous job.</i>

13:11.333 --> 13:13.085
<i>Start your journey.</i>

13:28.100 --> 13:29.268
The fuck?

13:43.532 --> 13:46.159
<i>Hello, chaps. Welcome, once again.</i>

13:46.159 --> 13:48.620
<i>If you are a beginner guitarist,
there's a really high chance</i>

13:48.620 --> 13:51.248
<i>that you are making
one of these five mistakes.</i>

13:51.248 --> 13:53.000
<i>Then I had, you know, a period of time</i>

13:53.000 --> 13:56.503
<i>where I was just practicing that
for just a whole weekend, in my pajamas.</i>

13:56.503 --> 13:59.173
<i>There's only one way
to become a Jeff Beck, a Jimmy Page.</i>

13:59.173 --> 14:00.090
<i>Let me tell you.</i>

14:00.090 --> 14:03.594
<i>This is how you might
imagine a typical guitar progress curve.</i>

14:03.594 --> 14:05.345
<i>Once you've put in your 10,000 hours,</i>

14:05.345 --> 14:07.472
<i>you're officially
a professional guitarist.</i>

14:08.849 --> 14:10.475
- Oh, no.
- <i>The three P's:</i>

14:10.475 --> 14:14.688
<i>practice, practice, practice, practice.
So, let's go with the four P's.</i>

14:16.648 --> 14:18.817
<i>I'm gonna teach you music theory
in ten minutes.</i>

14:18.817 --> 14:21.528
<i>What up, YouTube?
Your boy, ZR, ready to teach you</i>

14:21.528 --> 14:23.614
<i>how to shred the gnar on guitar.</i>

14:23.614 --> 14:25.490
<i>Hi again. Miss Allison here.</i>

14:25.490 --> 14:27.284
- <i>Now it's your turn!</i>
- What are you wearing?

14:31.455 --> 14:34.583
<i>Well, let me tell you,
you are about to embark on a relationship</i>

14:34.583 --> 14:36.001
<i>that will last you a lifetime.</i>

14:36.001 --> 14:39.755
<i>One of joy and calm and peace.</i>

14:40.756 --> 14:43.258
<i>A guitar is a lot like a bicycle.</i>

14:43.258 --> 14:46.386
<i>You put a little bit into it,
and you get a hell of a lot out.</i>

14:46.386 --> 14:49.097
<i>But this is just by way of an introduction
to lessons with me.</i>

14:49.097 --> 14:51.975
<i>Let's all just sit here and think
about that for a second.</i>

14:51.975 --> 14:56.647
<i>About the potential that's already there
in the room with you right now.</i>

14:57.606 --> 15:02.444
<i>If you wanna learn to play,
just hit that button there and sign up.</i>

15:04.738 --> 15:05.906
<i>Bye.</i>

15:09.868 --> 15:11.119
Twenty fucking dollars?

15:22.464 --> 15:23.924
Perfect.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.467
<i>Got magic
Abra da Cabra</i>

15:27.094 --> 15:28.887
<i>Got magic
Abra da Cabra</i>

15:31.390 --> 15:33.058
That's very nice, girls. Very nice.

15:33.058 --> 15:35.018
<i>Serious charms
I got serious fuckin' charms</i>

15:35.018 --> 15:36.728
<i>Red hot girls buzz around in swarms</i>

15:36.728 --> 15:38.730
<i>Round me neck
Hangin' off me arms</i>

15:38.730 --> 15:42.651
<i>Serious guns, I got serious guns
Blap, blap, blap...</i>

15:42.651 --> 15:44.486
Come on. It's dinner time.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.781
<i>Got wand, got whip
Got honey, got grip</i>

15:47.781 --> 15:49.324
<i>Got money, got wow!</i>

15:49.324 --> 15:51.243
<i>Got shot, so what? No worry
Got God on me payroll...</i>

15:51.243 --> 15:52.411
See ya, Samantha.

15:52.411 --> 15:55.205
<i>Got girls appearing
From the North Side</i>

15:55.205 --> 15:56.248
It looks brilliant.

16:03.172 --> 16:05.299
<i>Fuck! This is crazy.</i>

16:06.550 --> 16:10.179
<i>Flying like eagles. And-- Shit...</i>

16:11.555 --> 16:12.681
Right, I'm going out.

16:13.599 --> 16:15.976
To where? To that lot you were with today?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.938
No, just off to Rhys's house,
then over to the precinct for a bit.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.567
You're not going to do some BASE jumping
off some buildings or something?

16:23.567 --> 16:25.402
No. We don't have a GoPro anyway.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.279
'Cause the last thing I want
is the Guards calling here,

16:27.279 --> 16:29.865
telling me you've fallen off
a tower block or something.

16:30.741 --> 16:33.243
And you're dead. And gone.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.457
Be back at 9:00!

16:38.457 --> 16:40.334
- For what?
- Because I fucking say so.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.085
I can't wait for the day
I don't have to be here.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.922
The only reason you're here
is 'cause your da wants his days off

16:44.922 --> 16:46.215
for his projects.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.675
Otherwise you'd be with him 24-7,
trust me.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.469
If you don't want me here,
why do I have to be back at 9:00?

16:50.469 --> 16:52.513
Don't play mind games with me. Get out.

16:55.766 --> 16:57.893
<i>Hey, Flora, are you my 12:00 p.m.?</i>

16:57.893 --> 16:58.977
Yeah.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.063
<i>How are you?</i>

17:01.688 --> 17:03.106
I'm all right. How are you?

17:03.774 --> 17:05.983
<i>Yeah, sun is shining in Los Angeles.</i>

17:05.983 --> 17:09.738
<i>I can smell the eucalyptus
on the breeze, so can't complain.</i>

17:09.738 --> 17:11.323
Yeah, lovely here in Dublin too.

17:11.823 --> 17:12.907
<i>Is it evening there?</i>

17:13.784 --> 17:15.661
No, it's just permanently this grim.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.039
<i>So, you wanna learn the guitar.</i>

17:19.039 --> 17:20.499
Is it easy?

17:21.791 --> 17:22.960
<i>Depends what you wanna do with it.</i>

17:23.460 --> 17:25.253
<i>Do you want to
just play for your own pleasure,</i>

17:25.253 --> 17:26.630
<i>or you wanna play for other people,</i>

17:26.630 --> 17:30.133
<i>you wanna write songs on it
or learn your favorite songs?</i>

17:30.133 --> 17:32.135
<i>What are you hoping to get out of this?</i>

17:32.135 --> 17:37.975
I look at women playing the guitar
or the piano, and it's so sexy.

17:38.559 --> 17:42.521
<i>Wow. I guess that is
why a lot of people take up an instrument.</i>

17:42.521 --> 17:45.023
- Is that why you took it up?
- <i>No.</i>

17:45.023 --> 17:47.317
No, you look pretty good.
Wouldn't say you need it.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.154
- <i>Okay.</i>
- So why'd you start then?

17:52.322 --> 17:54.241
<i>Let's focus on you, all right?</i>

17:54.241 --> 17:55.576
Good plan.

17:55.576 --> 17:59.162
<i>Okay. So, let's sit it up there.</i>

17:59.162 --> 18:02.875
<i>I'll teach you some root chords.
Let's start with G.</i>

18:06.420 --> 18:07.421
<i>Ready?</i>

18:09.006 --> 18:10.257
- Brilliant.
- <i>Okay.</i>

18:12.759 --> 18:15.637
So how many chords do you need to know
before you can write a song?

18:16.180 --> 18:20.100
<i>It's not really
about the number of chords.</i>

18:20.100 --> 18:22.728
<i>It's more, you know, how you use them.</i>

18:23.979 --> 18:25.856
<i>Like-- Here.</i>

18:50.797 --> 18:52.508
<i>Okay. Same song.</i>

19:52.860 --> 19:53.861
Jesus.

19:53.861 --> 19:56.446
<i>Yeah, so the first version,
it uses all the same,</i>

19:56.446 --> 19:59.116
<i>you know, paints and canvas and brushes.</i>

19:59.116 --> 20:05.247
<i>But the second version has got 20 years
of life and heartache on display.</i>

20:05.873 --> 20:08.792
<i>You can see all the brushstrokes.</i>

20:09.877 --> 20:12.629
<i>All that personality's
in the same three chords.</i>

20:12.629 --> 20:15.382
<i>And you can know a thousand chords</i>

20:15.382 --> 20:18.260
<i>and never write something
as beautiful as that.</i>

20:19.678 --> 20:20.679
Is that your problem?

20:22.222 --> 20:23.557
<i>I didn't know I had a problem.</i>

20:23.557 --> 20:25.225
You're teaching guitar online, love.

20:26.685 --> 20:30.564
- <i>Right. You're Irish.</i>
- So do you know a thousand chords?

20:31.064 --> 20:33.108
<i>What I'm saying is,
we all know the same number of words,</i>

20:33.108 --> 20:35.068
<i>but we don't all write
a Shakespeare sonnet.</i>

20:36.945 --> 20:38.197
I'm confused.

20:38.197 --> 20:41.700
<i>Good. What are your goals?
Besides being sexy.</i>

20:43.577 --> 20:44.578
Impress people.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.413
- <i>Who?</i>
- Men.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.332
- <i>Why?</i>
- Sex and company.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.499
<i>Yeah, but what else?</i>

20:50.375 --> 20:51.752
To make them like me.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.339
- <i>Why don't they like you already?</i>
- I don't know.

20:56.215 --> 20:58.634
<i>Maybe they can't see your brushstrokes.</i>

21:03.764 --> 21:05.140
Are you coming on to me?

21:06.350 --> 21:08.977
- <i>Sorry?</i>
- So you're a songwriter too?

21:10.312 --> 21:11.772
- <i>How do you know that?</i>
- Google.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.524
Took about six seconds.

21:13.524 --> 21:15.150
Where do you live in LA?

21:15.150 --> 21:17.319
<i>I live in Topanga Canyon.</i>

21:17.319 --> 21:21.156
I heard of that. I bet you drive
a pickup and work with horses.

21:22.241 --> 21:23.242
<i>I do not work with horses.</i>

21:23.242 --> 21:24.326
What's your star sign?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.745
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- You don't know your own birthday?

21:26.745 --> 21:28.580
<i>Let's get back to the lesson, all right?</i>

21:28.580 --> 21:32.876
<i>Let me ask you, do you consider yourself
a big music person?</i>

21:33.377 --> 21:36.255
I mean,
I was always very attracted to musicians.

21:37.005 --> 21:40.467
I married one. He was on
the same bill as Snow Patrol once.

21:40.467 --> 21:46.014
<i>No, I'm asking, what are you doing here,
Flora, if music's not really your thing?</i>

21:47.933 --> 21:49.393
I liked the look of ya.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.228
<i>Okay.</i>

21:51.228 --> 21:53.981
All the other teachers seemed
like real posers and wankers,

21:53.981 --> 21:55.566
you know, failed musicians.

21:55.566 --> 21:58.151
But you seemed sorta...

21:59.778 --> 22:01.113
real.

22:02.114 --> 22:03.365
<i>I am real.</i>

22:03.365 --> 22:07.077
You sorta calmed me down
when I saw you for the first time.

22:08.704 --> 22:13.208
Your voice was all soothing. Like a bath.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.504
<i>Right.</i>

22:18.130 --> 22:19.339
Can I ask you something?

22:20.340 --> 22:23.302
- <i>Sure.</i>
- You might find it a little bit weird.

22:24.928 --> 22:29.099
Could you play
that same song again, but this time...

22:31.643 --> 22:32.895
with your shirt off?

23:11.058 --> 23:15.270
Dear Jeff, I'm sorry
for messing around on our last lesson.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.273
Suffice to say that wine had been taken.

23:19.024 --> 23:24.738
I do intend to learn the guitar
and take it seriously. Why? I don't know.

23:25.781 --> 23:28.450
I was always the one in class
making fun of the teacher.

23:28.951 --> 23:33.622
Because someone had to.
But I won't, if you'll keep teaching me.

23:34.665 --> 23:36.291
Sorry I objectified ya.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.002
I can send you a picture
of my amazing tits

23:39.002 --> 23:43.257
to balance things out again,
if you'd like? Flora.

23:50.097 --> 23:52.766
Right, now, let's get
that shite off your arse.

23:56.645 --> 23:57.688
Ready?

24:21.211 --> 24:22.212
What is that?

24:27.551 --> 24:29.553
- What are you doing though? It's annoying.
- Shut up!

24:31.513 --> 24:32.347
Fucking woman.

24:36.894 --> 24:37.895
Fuck.

24:39.730 --> 24:41.857
- Right, I'm going out.
- Good.

24:42.649 --> 24:43.650
I mean, where?

24:44.401 --> 24:45.402
Just around.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.697
You gonna be hanging out with
that girl I've seen you with?

24:49.198 --> 24:51.241
The one dressed up like
a prostitute in your man's video?

24:51.241 --> 24:53.952
Samantha? Don't know, she could be there.

24:53.952 --> 24:55.037
What's she like?

24:55.621 --> 24:58.540
Don't know. Don't really care.
Right, back at 9:00.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.125
Or 10:00!

25:03.879 --> 25:04.880
If you like.

25:12.054 --> 25:13.055
Hiya.

25:13.555 --> 25:14.890
Can't believe you got back to me.

25:14.890 --> 25:18.060
<i>Well, you're a challenge.
I like a challenge. Should we get started?</i>

25:18.060 --> 25:19.311
Let's rock.

25:19.811 --> 25:22.564
<i>All right.
Flora, let's get to know you a bit better.</i>

25:22.564 --> 25:24.358
<i>What is your all-time favorite song?</i>

25:28.237 --> 25:30.030
I'm more into dance music.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.536
"You're Beautiful" by James Blunt.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.747
<i>Okay, we're gonna have a problem.</i>

25:39.331 --> 25:42.167
- Why?
- <i>That's not an acceptable song.</i>

25:42.835 --> 25:43.961
It's catchy.

25:43.961 --> 25:45.087
<i>So was cholera.</i>

25:45.087 --> 25:46.296
I don't know that one.

25:47.256 --> 25:49.258
<i>If you're gonna be learning to play songs,</i>

25:49.258 --> 25:51.718
<i>we're just gonna need
to raise the bar a little bit.</i>

25:52.219 --> 25:54.513
- What have you written then?
- <i>I'm a teacher.</i>

25:54.513 --> 25:56.890
Exactly. So shut up criticizing Blunt.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.393
- You do it.
- <i>Do what?</i>

25:59.393 --> 26:03.981
Write a song that reaches millions
of people's hearts and makes them weep.

26:03.981 --> 26:07.568
<i>Making people cry is not an achievement.
Bullies do it every day.</i>

26:07.568 --> 26:09.278
Let's hear one of your songs then.

26:09.278 --> 26:12.406
<i>Lyrics need to be more
than just "you're beautiful"</i>

26:12.406 --> 26:15.075
<i>or some series of platitudes
for lonely women,</i>

26:15.075 --> 26:16.535
<i>trying to make 'em feel better
about themselves.</i>

26:16.535 --> 26:20.080
<i>That's not a love song.
That's a self-help group.</i>

26:21.081 --> 26:23.625
You don't know the first thing
about women if you think that.

26:23.625 --> 26:27.129
<i>I know that grown-ups don't want
to be told how pretty they are</i>

26:27.129 --> 26:29.089
<i>like some creep trying
to pick 'em up at a bar.</i>

26:29.089 --> 26:31.675
Jesus Christ, it's just a bloody song.

26:31.675 --> 26:34.136
<i>No. It is never just a song.</i>

26:34.136 --> 26:36.763
<i>It is a three-and-a-half-minute
pause in time</i>

26:36.763 --> 26:40.684
<i>in which to do something wonderful,
something touched by God.</i>

26:40.684 --> 26:43.604
Oh, no. Are you some sort
of Christian evangelist dude?

26:43.604 --> 26:46.940
<i>I get along without you</i>

26:47.524 --> 26:51.278
<i>Very well</i>

26:51.778 --> 26:55.699
<i>Of course, I do</i>

26:58.994 --> 27:02.748
<i>Except when soft rains fall</i>

27:03.832 --> 27:08.253
<i>And drip from leaves, then I recall</i>

27:08.837 --> 27:13.258
<i>The thrill of being sheltered</i>

27:13.258 --> 27:18.680
<i>In your arms</i>

27:18.680 --> 27:24.061
<i>Of course, I do</i>

27:27.731 --> 27:32.903
<i>But I get along without you</i>

27:33.987 --> 27:39.785
<i>Very well</i>

27:43.872 --> 27:45.415
- Jesus Christ.
- Right?

27:46.166 --> 27:49.419
- That's unbelievable.
- So simple, so direct.

27:49.419 --> 27:51.213
Nothing about beauty.

27:51.213 --> 27:52.548
You are a genius.

27:55.759 --> 27:56.844
So you really like it?

27:56.844 --> 28:00.389
It's stunning. You've got to get
that out there in the world.

28:00.389 --> 28:03.267
You think that would sell as much as
"You're Beautiful"?

28:03.267 --> 28:06.395
Maybe not as much as that. I mean, I still
like the other song too. Is that allowed?

28:06.395 --> 28:08.480
No, that's Stockholm syndrome.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.649
We're gonna "de-brainwash" you.
By the time we're finished here,

28:10.649 --> 28:14.611
you're not gonna have time
for these childish jingles and clichés.

28:15.445 --> 28:17.322
- I'm exhausted.
- Well, we're just getting started.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.241
You wanna learn the chords to that song
so you can play it?

28:19.241 --> 28:20.993
- Yeah.
- All right. Starts with C.

28:23.495 --> 28:27.249
So, your ring finger,
here on the fifth string.

28:27.249 --> 28:28.625
Right there at that dot. Yep.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.420
You have lovely long fingers.
Mine are quite stubby.

28:31.420 --> 28:34.131
Your fingers don't matter.
Django Reinhardt was missing two fingers.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.300
- Wow. I love him.
- Uh-huh.

28:37.718 --> 28:40.596
So, the middle finger there,
then your pointer's way up here.

28:41.180 --> 28:42.598
Yep.

28:42.598 --> 28:47.186
- There. And there?
- There you go. One up. Strum that.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.105
Yeah! Yeah.

28:52.608 --> 28:54.568
- Feels good, right?
- Yeah, baby!

28:57.446 --> 28:58.447
Sorry.

28:59.573 --> 29:02.326
- What's that?
- Nothing. I love this.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.161
You're a quick learner.

29:04.161 --> 29:05.329
I knew I'd be good at this.

29:06.079 --> 29:07.623
Let's move on. What else you got?

29:08.165 --> 29:12.628
Well, next would be G and then F,
but let's stick for a second on C.

29:13.212 --> 29:14.254
Okay, let's.

29:14.254 --> 29:18.175
You are now the proud owner of C, right?

29:18.175 --> 29:20.427
And you didn't own that five minutes ago.

29:21.094 --> 29:23.805
You're rich.
You own something Elvis owned.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.975
- I'd rather have his plane.
- Plus, it didn't cost you anything.

29:26.975 --> 29:29.686
Well, $20 for this class,
but I do know what you mean. Go on.

29:29.686 --> 29:33.148
You own something new,
and nobody can take it away from you.

29:33.148 --> 29:35.526
And this isn't just some must-have object.

29:35.526 --> 29:38.195
It's not a bag or a car or a phone.

29:38.195 --> 29:41.657
You ever seen an ad
for a guitar? No, it sells itself.

29:41.657 --> 29:46.036
This is a gift you can take to your grave,
and you can use it whenever you want.

29:46.036 --> 29:47.871
And in the right context,

29:48.455 --> 29:51.583
it can speak directly to your heart
in ways we don't even understand.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.419
More than thoughts, more than words,
more than ideas.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.548
Just a chord, hanging there in the air.

30:00.926 --> 30:02.010
C.

30:16.942 --> 30:19.945
<i>Woken up by the birds</i>

30:22.239 --> 30:27.578
<i>She wonders what they think about</i>

30:28.078 --> 30:29.663
<i>If instead</i>

30:29.663 --> 30:33.625
<i>She meets a man
Who shows her magic tricks</i>

30:33.625 --> 30:36.253
<i>All sorts of magic tricks</i>

30:36.253 --> 30:40.549
<i>And he lets her live...</i>

30:42.342 --> 30:46.013
- Can anyone sign up?
- For sure, yeah. That's the idea.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.140
Just keeping the music local.

30:48.807 --> 30:49.850
What's the cash prize?

30:49.850 --> 30:53.187
Eighty percent of the door.
There's usually about 50 punters.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.772
- How much a head?
- Fiver.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.193
Jesus, that's pricey enough.
Are they all that shit?

31:00.819 --> 31:04.156
It's not about that. It's about keeping
music alive in the neighborhood.

31:04.156 --> 31:05.240
That's all I'm about.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.825
So who decides who wins?

31:07.326 --> 31:11.205
I do. Barry Byrne. Events promoter.

31:12.956 --> 31:14.166
I know who you are, Barry.

31:14.875 --> 31:15.876
Oh, yeah?

31:17.169 --> 31:19.630
Oh, Jesus. How are ya?

31:20.380 --> 31:22.799
Don't tell me. Fiona.

31:23.967 --> 31:24.968
Flora.

31:26.011 --> 31:27.429
Knew you were in the F's.

31:28.430 --> 31:30.390
Better go in. Good to see you again.

31:31.225 --> 31:32.226
In the daylight.

31:34.186 --> 31:35.187
I bet she wins!

31:43.946 --> 31:45.030
<i>Singing...</i>

31:49.368 --> 31:50.911
You look very young.

31:51.787 --> 31:52.913
I was very young.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.126
How much do you think that cost
to shoot that?

31:58.710 --> 32:00.796
- No clue.
- Two grand we got

32:00.796 --> 32:01.922
from the record label for it.

32:01.922 --> 32:05.008
We had a crane
for every shot in this. Every shot.

32:05.008 --> 32:08.303
- Did you have a trailer?
- No, but we had a fucking crane.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.723
So, did you go to America for that?

32:11.723 --> 32:13.433
- Looks like it, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

32:13.433 --> 32:15.102
No,
we fucking shot it all around Drimnagh.

32:16.770 --> 32:18.564
Why is there a cop in every shot?

32:18.564 --> 32:20.732
'Cause it's America, you know.

32:22.442 --> 32:24.903
- There's that same cop again.
- Fucking pay attention, will you?

32:27.155 --> 32:28.156
There's Ma. See ya, Da.

32:37.499 --> 32:38.500
What's that?

32:40.169 --> 32:42.421
What's what? It's just me guitar.

32:43.255 --> 32:45.215
I have a lesson later.
I thought I'd do it in the park.

32:45.924 --> 32:47.259
What's this all about, Flora?

32:48.302 --> 32:50.721
- What's what about?
- This whole fucking musical thing.

32:51.763 --> 32:55.142
Anytime I tried to get ya to listen
to new music, you just fucking tuned out.

32:55.142 --> 32:58.896
Yeah, my tutor says I have
"genuine appreciation of melody."

33:00.355 --> 33:01.398
Now.

33:01.398 --> 33:04.359
What do you listen to then?
Apart from club music.

33:04.359 --> 33:05.819
Give me five bands. Go on.

33:06.945 --> 33:08.280
Well, I like his songs anyway.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.823
He's a songwriter too, is he?

33:09.823 --> 33:12.659
Yeah, he is. He's brilliant actually.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.244
What's his name?

33:14.745 --> 33:15.579
Jeff...

33:19.082 --> 33:20.083
the guitar guy.

33:20.667 --> 33:22.794
Sounds like some fucking clown
who never made it,

33:22.794 --> 33:24.588
teaching guitar lessons online.

33:25.756 --> 33:28.383
That's the ultimate graveyard
for failed musicians.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.011
Are you a little bit jealous?

33:31.011 --> 33:34.431
No. Just concerned.

33:35.891 --> 33:37.184
- How's Juanita?
- She's great.

33:38.477 --> 33:40.437
You do know she's not Spanish, right?

33:41.230 --> 33:42.731
Her nana's people were from Spain.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.609
My people were from Norway.
That doesn't make me a fucking Viking.

33:50.531 --> 33:52.157
Does she blow you like I did?

33:52.991 --> 33:54.952
What? Shut up.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.913
I'm serious. Does she?

33:59.456 --> 34:00.457
You're nuts.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.711
She doesn't blow you, does she?

34:04.711 --> 34:08.257
Yeah, she does. She has. Yeah.

34:09.216 --> 34:15.389
She doesn't. I knew it.
Her mouth's too small.

34:16.639 --> 34:20.018
Is she out?
Will I come up for a few minutes?

34:20.686 --> 34:22.478
We'll send Max off for an ice cream.

34:23.230 --> 34:24.481
Don't be fucking mad.

34:24.481 --> 34:27.775
I bet she doesn't let you come all
down her neck and tits the way I did.

34:32.572 --> 34:33.574
Come on, Max!

34:37.327 --> 34:38.704
Are you getting rid of that guitar?

34:40.455 --> 34:42.416
This? No, why?

34:45.710 --> 34:48.172
- Jesus.
- Wake up, will you!

34:48.172 --> 34:49.172
Fuck off!

34:49.172 --> 34:52.509
You stepped right in front of me.
Will you watch where you're going?

34:52.509 --> 34:56.013
You watch where you're going or I'll wrap
that fucking lock around your neck!

35:02.227 --> 35:03.687
What are you doing with it then?

35:04.188 --> 35:07.816
It was just sitting there. Why?
Do you want it? You can have it.

35:08.609 --> 35:11.320
I don't.
I don't like acoustic guitar music anyway.

35:11.820 --> 35:13.197
What are you into then?

35:13.780 --> 35:15.532
Ambient. Electronic.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.619
I always loved dance music.

35:19.453 --> 35:20.454
Like what?

35:21.038 --> 35:23.999
Container. Sophie is amazing.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.335
Orbital, back in the day.

35:26.835 --> 35:29.338
- Who the fuck are they?
- Dance music.

35:30.797 --> 35:31.924
What are you into then?

35:32.424 --> 35:34.176
Marconi Union. Do you know them?

35:34.676 --> 35:35.677
No.

35:36.512 --> 35:39.723
They're from Manchester, I think.
Real trance music.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.476
It sounds like a computer made it.
It's deadly.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.812
I have some on me phone
if you want to listen to them.

35:45.812 --> 35:46.813
What, now?

35:46.813 --> 35:48.482
- Whenever--
- Right, you've got your key.

35:49.024 --> 35:51.193
There's waffles in the fridge.
I'm heading out.

35:51.902 --> 35:54.279
- Bye.
- I'll be back in an hour and a half!

35:54.279 --> 35:55.489
I don't care.

36:12.464 --> 36:13.715
So, am I ready?

36:13.715 --> 36:14.633
<i>For what?</i>

36:14.633 --> 36:17.302
To write a female empowerment ballad
and get me husband back.

36:18.470 --> 36:19.680
<i>Why did he leave?</i>

36:21.181 --> 36:22.057
Anger?

36:22.641 --> 36:23.475
<i>Why is he angry?</i>

36:23.475 --> 36:27.604
No, me. I'm angry. I almost killed
a cyclist today with his own lock.

36:27.604 --> 36:28.939
<i>What are you angry about?</i>

36:30.023 --> 36:32.067
Dunno. I wake up angry.

36:33.235 --> 36:34.862
I'm angry at me son all the time.

36:35.654 --> 36:38.156
I thought this guitar lark
might make him think I'm cool.

36:38.156 --> 36:39.783
<i>Hold on. You have a son?</i>

36:40.659 --> 36:44.580
I had him when I was very young.
I was 17. Do you have kids?

36:45.455 --> 36:48.792
<i>I do. I actually had them kinda young too,
so they're huge now.</i>

36:50.002 --> 36:51.253
<i>But they do think I'm cool.</i>

36:51.753 --> 36:53.422
Play me your song again.

36:54.173 --> 36:56.425
<i>Yeah, I wanted to bring that up.</i>

36:57.718 --> 36:59.052
<i>So that wasn't my song.</i>

36:59.887 --> 37:01.430
What? Whose is it?

37:01.430 --> 37:04.099
<i>It was written by Hoagy Carmichael.</i>

37:04.766 --> 37:07.477
Oh, love.
Why'd you tell me it was your song?

37:08.103 --> 37:10.189
<i>Well, I didn't. You presumed.</i>

37:11.982 --> 37:14.193
<i>But then I let you. So, sorry.</i>

37:14.193 --> 37:15.277
Why?

37:16.111 --> 37:17.863
<i>I guess I wanted to see how it felt.</i>

37:17.863 --> 37:18.906
To what?

37:18.906 --> 37:21.575
<i>To have written a song like that,
in someone else's eyes.</i>

37:21.575 --> 37:25.746
<i>Yeah, stupid.
I apologize. Let's get back to the lesson.</i>

37:26.246 --> 37:27.706
Why? What normally happens?

37:30.125 --> 37:31.710
<i>You wanna hear one of my songs?</i>

37:31.710 --> 37:33.587
- Yeah.
- <i>All right.</i>

37:48.560 --> 37:54.650
<i>Get in my car
I'll drive you through the canyon</i>

37:55.817 --> 37:59.404
<i>Breathe in Topanga for the day</i>

38:02.157 --> 38:04.743
<i>And when we reach the ocean</i>

38:04.743 --> 38:07.913
<i>And we can't go further west</i>

38:07.913 --> 38:12.793
<i>We'll keep on driving anyway</i>

38:16.505 --> 38:21.260
<i>She's never boring
She's kind to me</i>

38:23.512 --> 38:28.100
<i>And every morning she's a mystery</i>

38:31.270 --> 38:33.355
<i>Welcome to LA</i>

38:36.441 --> 38:42.531
<i>Where everything and nothing changes
Every single day</i>

38:45.033 --> 38:51.039
<i>The sunshine on the darkness melts
The morning haze away</i>

38:53.792 --> 38:57.796
<i>And I won't let the bright lights
Bring me down</i>

38:59.506 --> 39:05.012
<i>In this angels town
Welcome to LA</i>

39:12.311 --> 39:15.147
It's lovely. You're really good at songs.

39:16.940 --> 39:17.941
But?

39:18.859 --> 39:20.652
Would I wanna hear it again?

39:23.280 --> 39:24.114
Sorry.

39:24.114 --> 39:27.701
No. Don't be sorry.
If everybody were as honest as you,

39:29.244 --> 39:31.496
I wouldn't have had to waste
a decade and a half of my life.

39:31.496 --> 39:34.708
We should get back to the lesson.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.126
Don't feel sorry for yourself.

39:36.126 --> 39:41.131
No. I'm not. I mean,
it's a humbling realization.

39:41.131 --> 39:45.093
You know, you sit down and wanna play
something for somebody, and they're ready.

39:45.093 --> 39:46.678
You're, like, receptive.

39:48.514 --> 39:50.933
And you watch as their eyes glaze over.

39:50.933 --> 39:53.894
And it's harder for them
than it is for you.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.774
It's the smiling with the mouth
but not the eyes. That's how you know.

39:59.274 --> 40:00.192
Know what?

40:00.692 --> 40:03.111
That they're unchanged.

40:05.656 --> 40:08.825
Anyway. A, D and E. One, four, five.

40:14.873 --> 40:16.166
Come on.

40:17.835 --> 40:20.254
You know what,
I'm gonna give you some homework tonight.

40:20.254 --> 40:23.257
There's a song I want you to listen to.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.634
I'll send you a link.

40:25.634 --> 40:26.802
Give it a listen.

40:27.970 --> 40:28.971
Play. Come on.

40:51.827 --> 40:55.497
<i>Rows and floes of angel hair</i>

40:56.373 --> 41:00.377
<i>And ice cream castles in the air</i>

41:00.961 --> 41:05.007
<i>And feather canyons everywhere</i>

41:05.716 --> 41:09.136
<i>I've looked at clouds that way</i>

41:10.429 --> 41:14.808
<i>But now they only block the sun</i>

41:14.808 --> 41:19.146
<i>They rain and snow on everyone</i>

41:19.688 --> 41:23.358
<i>So many things I would have done</i>

41:24.026 --> 41:27.613
<i>But clouds got in my way</i>

41:28.322 --> 41:33.076
<i>Oh, I've looked at clouds
From both sides now</i>

41:33.076 --> 41:37.748
<i>From up and down, and still somehow</i>

41:37.748 --> 41:43.128
<i>It's cloud illusions I recall</i>

41:43.128 --> 41:47.132
<i>I really don't know clouds</i>

41:49.968 --> 41:51.428
<i>At all</i>

41:59.853 --> 42:03.899
<i>Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels</i>

42:03.899 --> 42:08.403
<i>The dizzy dancing way you feel</i>

42:08.403 --> 42:12.991
<i>As every fairy tale comes real</i>

42:12.991 --> 42:16.912
<i>Oh, I've looked at love that way</i>

42:17.538 --> 42:22.376
<i>But now it's just another show</i>

42:22.376 --> 42:27.256
<i>You leave 'em laughing when you go</i>

42:27.256 --> 42:31.301
<i>And if you care, don't let them know</i>

42:31.301 --> 42:35.222
<i>No, don't give yourself away</i>

42:35.931 --> 42:40.435
<i>I've looked at love
From both sides now</i>

42:40.936 --> 42:45.232
<i>From give and take, and still somehow</i>

42:45.232 --> 42:49.778
<i>It's love's illusions I recall</i>

42:49.778 --> 42:54.283
<i>Oh, I really don't know love</i>

42:56.869 --> 42:57.953
<i>At all</i>

43:01.290 --> 43:06.003
<i>Oh, I've looked at life
From both sides now</i>

43:06.003 --> 43:10.674
<i>From win and lose and still somehow</i>

43:10.674 --> 43:15.012
<i>It's life's illusions I recall</i>

43:15.012 --> 43:18.891
<i>Oh, I really don't know life</i>

43:22.269 --> 43:23.437
<i>At all</i>

43:41.663 --> 43:43.457
Can I meet him? I mean, see him.

43:44.750 --> 43:45.876
- No.
- Please.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.754
I'll just stand in the corner of the room.
I'll be like a little mouse.

43:50.005 --> 43:51.215
That'd be so wrong.

43:51.215 --> 43:53.509
Is he good-looking?
Do you have a screen grab?

43:54.009 --> 43:56.053
- It's not about that.
- So he's a pig then.

43:56.553 --> 43:59.014
He never says what you expect him to say.

44:00.015 --> 44:04.019
And he's sensitive.
You can see in his eyes he's been hurt.

44:07.022 --> 44:08.440
What are his songs like?

44:11.485 --> 44:12.319
Not great.

44:12.319 --> 44:17.866
Oh, Jesus. You've fallen in love with
an ugly fella who lives 6,000 miles away.

44:18.951 --> 44:19.952
Basically.

44:29.336 --> 44:32.047
...and we'll fuck behind the dunes.

44:37.928 --> 44:42.808
Fucking hell!
Jesus Christ, it's like a club in here!

44:42.808 --> 44:44.226
Turn it down a second!

44:45.352 --> 44:47.604
Jesus, that's loud.

44:47.604 --> 44:49.314
Yeah, Keith lent them to me.

44:49.857 --> 44:51.942
Really powerful.
Have to give them back tomorrow.

44:51.942 --> 44:53.277
The neighbors will be complaining.

44:53.277 --> 44:55.487
They're junkies.
They'll be asking to turn it up.

44:56.071 --> 44:56.905
Who's Keith?

44:56.905 --> 45:00.117
He's a mate. A rapper.
He lent me these for the night.

45:00.117 --> 45:01.994
- For what?
- So I could mix this track.

45:01.994 --> 45:03.078
Was that yours?

45:05.038 --> 45:09.334
You're joking me. How the fuck
did you make that? It sounded epic.

45:09.334 --> 45:10.419
GarageBand. It's simple.

45:11.295 --> 45:12.129
Explain.

45:13.130 --> 45:15.632
You get all your sounds from here,
like, instruments and all.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.719
- And you can get loops from here.
- What are loops?

45:18.719 --> 45:21.096
Drum patterns and stuff.
I mean, you can make your own.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.723
But you need a proper sequencer for that.

45:22.723 --> 45:25.809
And how do you control them?
Like, how do you get that mad piano sound?

45:27.019 --> 45:29.062
Well, you open
the "Keyboard typing," you know,

45:29.062 --> 45:30.272
use the laptop keys.

45:32.107 --> 45:33.192
No way.

45:36.236 --> 45:37.279
Sounds like a piano.

45:38.697 --> 45:39.698
Oh, shit.

45:43.869 --> 45:45.204
Not on me track. Turn it off.

45:45.204 --> 45:47.539
Jesus, it sounds very professional.

45:47.539 --> 45:51.627
It is. It's what loads of people start on.
It's shit doing it like this though.

45:52.127 --> 45:55.047
You need a proper synth.
Takes forever doing one note at a time.

45:56.173 --> 45:59.593
I've been at this for three hours today.
I'm fucking starving.

45:59.593 --> 46:00.928
Play it again.

46:00.928 --> 46:02.596
Please just make me a cheese toastie.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.601
Please.

46:08.143 --> 46:09.144
After.

46:16.485 --> 46:17.569
Do you have a lyric?

46:17.569 --> 46:19.905
- Got these, but they're not finished yet.
- Come on.

46:25.452 --> 46:27.371
<i>Come on, girl
You know how much I want you</i>

46:27.371 --> 46:30.499
<i>Like a ghost, I'm going to haunt you
Meet me at me crib</i>

46:30.499 --> 46:33.460
<i>Bring your friends
Maybe we can drive a Mercedes-Benz</i>

46:33.460 --> 46:35.838
<i>We'll hang out poolside
Have a drink</i>

46:35.838 --> 46:38.090
<i>Swimming against the tide
Not gonna sink</i>

46:38.090 --> 46:40.259
<i>Come on, girl
Let's get in trouble</i>

46:40.259 --> 46:42.344
<i>Shaken, not stirred
A James Bond from Dublin</i>

46:44.972 --> 46:46.098
What's it called?

46:46.098 --> 46:48.892
"Dublin 07." Like James Bond, but Dublin.

46:49.685 --> 46:53.689
Nah. You need a better title.
Let me try something here.

46:55.774 --> 46:58.235
<i>We got something real</i>

46:58.235 --> 47:01.905
<i>From the Joker with the Glasgow smile
Ready to die for you, I go in style</i>

47:01.905 --> 47:06.743
<i>Dressed from head to toe in Italian
In the bed, I'm like a stallion</i>

47:06.743 --> 47:10.539
<i>I'm the king of the MMA
Like Conor McGregor, only not as gay</i>

47:10.539 --> 47:13.125
<i>Living the dream
In a bed full of bitches</i>

47:13.125 --> 47:15.335
<i>The Midas touch, I got the riches</i>

47:15.335 --> 47:19.590
<i>And when they come and stitch me up
They better use Gucci stitches</i>

47:22.426 --> 47:23.510
It's fucking class, isn't it?

47:26.597 --> 47:27.931
Fucking hell, Son.

47:28.807 --> 47:30.767
Is this what you've been doing
on those headphones?

47:31.852 --> 47:32.853
Don't move.

47:38.150 --> 47:40.194
Come over here
and hear what your son made.

47:40.194 --> 47:42.905
<i>Come on, girl
You know how much I want you</i>

47:42.905 --> 47:45.908
<i>Like a ghost, I'm going to haunt you
Meet me at me crib</i>

47:45.908 --> 47:49.077
<i>Bring your friends
Maybe you can drive a Mercedes-Benz</i>

47:49.077 --> 47:51.330
<i>We'll hang out poolside
Have a drink</i>

47:51.330 --> 47:53.582
<i>Swimming against the tide
Not gonna sink</i>

47:53.582 --> 47:55.584
<i>Come on, girl
Let's get in trouble</i>

47:55.584 --> 47:57.920
<i>Shaken, not stirred
A James Bond from Dublin</i>

47:57.920 --> 48:00.464
<i>We got something real</i>

48:00.464 --> 48:02.299
<i>From the Joker with
The Glasgow smile</i>

48:02.299 --> 48:04.927
- <i>Ready to die for ya, I go in style</i>
- I love this.

48:05.469 --> 48:08.680
- That's me singing!
- <i>In the bed, I'm like a stallion</i>

48:09.181 --> 48:12.976
<i>I'm the king of the MMA
Like Conor McGregor, only not as gay</i>

48:13.560 --> 48:15.395
<i>Living the dream
In a bed full of bitches</i>

48:15.395 --> 48:17.356
<i>The Midas touch, I got the riches</i>

48:17.940 --> 48:21.610
<i>And when they snip me and stitch me up
They better use Gucci stitches</i>

48:21.610 --> 48:24.530
- <i>Yeah</i>
- <i>We got something real</i>

48:25.239 --> 48:28.617
<i>Come and get me, guys
Come and get me, boys</i>

48:29.117 --> 48:29.952
<i>Come and kill me--</i>

48:31.286 --> 48:32.621
Can you fucking play or what?

48:32.621 --> 48:33.705
I'm not playing for you.

48:34.331 --> 48:35.874
Go on, give us a tune on that guitar.

48:38.293 --> 48:39.628
- Come on.
- No.

48:39.628 --> 48:42.548
It's not that big of a fucking deal.
Would you just play one song?

48:46.718 --> 48:47.719
Okay.

48:52.266 --> 48:55.102
Ian. Why are you doing this to me?

48:55.102 --> 48:56.436
Come on, you'll be great.

49:01.149 --> 49:02.943
I can play you a song I wrote.

49:04.653 --> 49:06.238
- Okay, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:08.615 --> 49:10.659
Oh, my God. Okay.

49:26.508 --> 49:27.509
Yeah.

49:30.512 --> 49:35.684
<i>She goes by the name</i>

49:36.852 --> 49:40.063
<i>Sweet Juanita</i>

49:43.108 --> 49:47.946
<i>She hails from the town</i>

49:47.946 --> 49:50.616
<i>Of Dublin</i>

49:52.993 --> 49:57.414
<i>Her mother was from--</i>

49:57.414 --> 49:59.374
- Blanchardstown?
- Yeah. Blanch--

49:59.374 --> 50:01.793
<i>Blanchardstown</i>

50:03.587 --> 50:07.090
<i>Her father was from...</i>

50:10.135 --> 50:11.136
Come on, Max!

50:18.185 --> 50:21.188
<i>Juanita, Juanita, Juanita, Juanita</i>

50:30.781 --> 50:31.823
They're fabulous.

50:40.207 --> 50:41.208
Can I try that on?

50:43.335 --> 50:44.586
Yeah.

50:46.588 --> 50:47.589
Can we get it?

50:52.010 --> 50:53.011
What's it made of?

50:54.054 --> 50:56.849
It's full of feathers. Goose feathers.

50:56.849 --> 51:00.310
From a golden goose? Anyway, it's too big.

51:00.310 --> 51:01.353
That's the look.

51:01.353 --> 51:03.939
Yeah, for turtles. Come on, let's go!

51:09.778 --> 51:11.780
- <i>Yeah. See that?</i>
- Oh, yeah?

51:12.698 --> 51:15.409
<i>You're making progress.
Your left hand's getting stronger.</i>

51:15.409 --> 51:16.493
Thank you.

51:16.994 --> 51:18.662
I've been thinking about your song.

51:19.997 --> 51:20.831
<i>Okay.</i>

51:20.831 --> 51:22.165
I think it's salvageable.

51:22.165 --> 51:23.625
<i>Good to know.</i>

51:23.625 --> 51:26.420
The problem is that you have
a great opening verse.

51:26.420 --> 51:28.338
But the chorus isn't a lot better.

51:29.631 --> 51:34.178
Now, in my research, I find that choruses
used to be the big deal in a song.

51:34.761 --> 51:36.555
You know, what everyone was waiting for.

51:37.139 --> 51:41.476
But, nowadays, it's not like,
"Here comes the chorus, everyone."

51:41.476 --> 51:44.062
You know, 'cause unless you have
a killer chorus, which you don't,

51:44.062 --> 51:45.522
it's an anticlimax.

51:45.522 --> 51:47.900
<i>So, what you're saying is,
my verse is too good?</i>

51:48.734 --> 51:50.903
Wow.
You are a glass-half-full kind of guy.

51:51.486 --> 51:52.988
I guess that's one way of looking at it.

51:54.031 --> 51:55.699
You play the first verse and sing it,

51:55.699 --> 51:59.536
and then play it again,
and I'll hum what I mean. Ready?

52:00.621 --> 52:01.914
- <i>What, now?</i>
- Yeah.

52:02.664 --> 52:03.874
<i>What about the lesson?</i>

52:03.874 --> 52:06.710
This is the lesson. Go.

52:06.710 --> 52:10.506
<i>Okay. So, you want me to play...</i>

52:11.590 --> 52:17.012
<i>Get in my car
I'll drive you through the canyon</i>

52:18.597 --> 52:21.517
<i>Breathe in Topanga for the day</i>

52:24.228 --> 52:26.605
<i>And when we reach the ocean</i>

52:26.605 --> 52:29.775
<i>And we can't go further west</i>

52:29.775 --> 52:34.112
<i>We'll keep on driving anyway</i>

52:41.078 --> 52:46.792
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la</i>

52:46.792 --> 52:48.210
Do you know what I mean?

52:48.210 --> 52:50.838
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

52:50.838 --> 52:52.422
Up.

52:52.422 --> 52:53.549
<i>La, la</i>

52:55.425 --> 52:57.052
No. It's, like-- That's not it.

52:57.803 --> 53:02.558
- <i>La, la</i>
- <i>La, la, la, la</i>

53:02.558 --> 53:03.642
<i>La</i>

53:05.310 --> 53:06.353
Like...

53:06.353 --> 53:08.689
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

53:13.777 --> 53:15.529
And have a better lyric?

53:16.113 --> 53:17.531
<i>Okay. I'll get right on that.</i>

53:17.531 --> 53:19.283
No, I have a better lyric.

53:19.992 --> 53:20.951
<i>You do?</i>

53:20.951 --> 53:24.496
Yeah, I'll email them.
You can take 'em or leave 'em.

53:25.789 --> 53:29.209
<i>I'll give 'em a shot.</i>

53:29.209 --> 53:31.461
<i>I'll try to fold them in.
I can't promise it'll work.</i>

53:32.337 --> 53:34.840
Okay. Whatever. Can I get 10%?

53:35.924 --> 53:39.845
<i>You can get 100%. I stopped trying
to make money with my music.</i>

53:39.845 --> 53:42.472
<i>I tried that for years.
It almost killed the thing I love.</i>

53:44.224 --> 53:45.225
This is fun.

53:47.769 --> 53:48.770
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:49.605 --> 53:50.981
<i>All right, Flora, see you next week.</i>

53:51.815 --> 53:52.733
Okay.

53:58.947 --> 54:00.532
He's very cute.

54:00.532 --> 54:01.617
Right?

54:03.410 --> 54:06.288
- <i>Shiny new wheels</i>
- You are absolute naturals.

54:06.288 --> 54:07.998
<i>Drop top roof so your man can run</i>

54:07.998 --> 54:10.584
- <i>Gone like poof! when the Garda come</i>
- That's it, girls. Keep it going.

54:10.584 --> 54:13.253
<i>Got wand, got whip, got honey
Got grip, got money, got style</i>

54:13.921 --> 54:15.088
<i>Got caught, so what?
No worry</i>

54:15.088 --> 54:16.757
- <i>Them Guards can't resist my smile</i>
- Sell it.

54:16.757 --> 54:19.801
<i>Got girls appearing
From the North Side</i>

54:19.801 --> 54:21.720
- That's brillo.
- <i>Got girls appearing</i>

54:21.720 --> 54:23.430
<i>From the South Side</i>

54:23.430 --> 54:26.850
<i>Like that
Girls in the back o' my ride</i>

54:26.850 --> 54:30.354
<i>Goin' back to me flat in my Hyundai</i>

54:31.772 --> 54:33.106
Lovely. That's enough.

54:35.317 --> 54:37.402
Right. Now, I say we...

54:37.402 --> 54:38.737
Hey, Samantha.

54:39.905 --> 54:41.073
How are you, Matt?

54:41.615 --> 54:43.700
Why don't you just ask her out,
for waffles?

54:43.700 --> 54:44.785
No way.

54:47.371 --> 54:48.872
- Hiya, Samantha?
- Jesus Christ.

54:48.872 --> 54:50.165
Are you Cheryl's daughter?

54:50.165 --> 54:51.834
Hiya, Flora.

54:52.459 --> 54:53.627
Jesus, you've shot up.

54:53.627 --> 54:55.212
Stop, I know.
Taller than me mother now.

54:55.212 --> 54:57.422
- How's your ma?
- She's grand.

54:57.422 --> 55:00.050
Talks about you all the time.
The crack youse had.

55:00.717 --> 55:02.135
Don't talk to me!

55:03.053 --> 55:05.639
Do you wanna come up
for a bit of dinner with me and Max?

55:05.639 --> 55:06.932
When you wrap?

55:07.474 --> 55:08.392
No, you're grand.

55:08.392 --> 55:10.853
Come on.
Come up for some garlic bread.

55:11.937 --> 55:13.689
Nah. No, thanks.

55:15.524 --> 55:17.860
Right. Okay. See ya.

55:17.860 --> 55:18.944
See ya.

55:27.119 --> 55:28.537
What are you doing right now?

55:28.537 --> 55:29.913
You don't want to know.

55:29.913 --> 55:31.832
Tell me what you feel about her.

55:32.332 --> 55:33.750
I can't stop thinking of her.

55:33.750 --> 55:36.628
Good. Obsession. You're obsessed.

55:37.129 --> 55:38.130
I suppose.

55:38.630 --> 55:40.549
I was obsessed with your da.

55:41.508 --> 55:42.801
I don't care.

55:42.801 --> 55:43.886
So go on.

55:44.636 --> 55:45.888
She's totally out of me league.

55:45.888 --> 55:47.097
No, she's not.

55:47.097 --> 55:49.183
Yeah, she is. She gets off with Keith.

55:49.766 --> 55:51.768
She thinks
that Keith can offer her something.

55:52.352 --> 55:56.023
He's all glamorous and dangerous
with the 1,000-euro jackets.

55:56.023 --> 56:00.319
She needs to know that when she's done
with her gangster, you'll be there.

56:01.278 --> 56:02.821
That's you. The red.

56:04.740 --> 56:06.074
If we had an external microphone,

56:06.074 --> 56:07.993
- the quality would be much better.
- Yeah.

56:07.993 --> 56:10.495
- Do you want me to put reverb on?
- Yeah, can you?

56:10.495 --> 56:11.580
Yeah.

56:26.512 --> 56:28.597
That's cool.
Do it better and I'll loop it.

56:43.153 --> 56:44.404
Right. Write these down.

56:47.741 --> 56:48.659
- Go.
- You ready?

56:48.659 --> 56:49.576
Yeah.

56:49.576 --> 56:51.411
And when you're done getting knocked down.

56:52.746 --> 56:54.665
And when you're done getting up again.

56:57.876 --> 57:01.755
And when you're down on the canvas, baby...

57:03.257 --> 57:04.216
I'll-- Come on.

57:04.216 --> 57:07.302
"And when you're down on the canvas...

57:07.302 --> 57:08.387
- ...baby...
- ...baby."

57:08.887 --> 57:11.932
I'll be the one that
never counts your heart out.

57:11.932 --> 57:13.433
I'll be the one in your corner.

57:13.934 --> 57:15.602
I like that boxing metaphor.

57:21.191 --> 57:25.362
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

57:25.362 --> 57:26.864
<i>I'll be the one</i>

57:31.493 --> 57:32.828
Now send that to her.

57:32.828 --> 57:34.121
What?

57:34.121 --> 57:37.332
Well, that's the idea.
She has to hear your passion.

57:37.332 --> 57:40.669
It'll knock her off her feet.
Do you have her email?

57:40.669 --> 57:41.753
Are you serious?

57:43.922 --> 57:47.342
In fact, why stop there?

57:50.679 --> 57:52.222
Right, lads,
youse have 20 minutes.

57:53.307 --> 57:56.185
<i>And when you're done
With your boyfriend</i>

57:57.352 --> 58:00.522
<i>And when you're done
With the Tallaght girls</i>

58:01.773 --> 58:04.693
<i>I'll be the one who's waiting</i>

58:04.693 --> 58:07.196
- Come on, sing it to her.
- <i>And when you're done</i>

58:07.196 --> 58:10.073
- <i>With your baby sister</i>
- Sing it to her! She's in the camera,

58:10.073 --> 58:13.410
- in the lens. Think about that.
- <i>Banging the wall of your bedroom</i>

58:13.410 --> 58:15.787
- Look at her.
- <i>And when you're done</i>

58:15.787 --> 58:17.789
- <i>With the street drugs</i>
- Get angry.

58:17.789 --> 58:20.000
- You know what I mean? Think about Keith.
- <i>And when you're done</i>

58:20.000 --> 58:21.084
<i>With the stolen cars</i>

58:21.084 --> 58:22.753
That's it. Move your shoulders.

58:22.753 --> 58:24.046
<i>And when you've run</i>

58:24.046 --> 58:25.672
- <i>All your red lights</i>
- That's it.

58:25.672 --> 58:28.300
- Move your face. Express yourself.
- <i>I'll be the one</i>

58:28.300 --> 58:30.677
<i>Who would run through
The night for you</i>

58:30.677 --> 58:33.680
- Get angry! Come on. Think about it.
- <i>I'll be the ghost in your headlights</i>

58:33.680 --> 58:36.517
- I'll slap that phone out of your hand.
- <i>And when you're done</i>

58:36.517 --> 58:38.310
- <i>With your college</i>
- Okay.

58:38.310 --> 58:40.979
- Okay, I want you to think about her now.
- <i>And when you're done</i>

58:40.979 --> 58:43.732
- <i>With the college boys</i>
- <i>I want you to think about her with Keith.</i>

58:43.732 --> 58:47.569
<i>When you think you know
What the world is, darlin'</i>

58:48.153 --> 58:51.907
- <i>I'll be the one getting educated</i>
- How does that make you feel in here?

58:51.907 --> 58:54.826
<i>'Cause I wanna know everything
About you</i>

58:56.495 --> 59:00.207
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:00.791 --> 59:04.294
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:04.878 --> 59:08.674
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:08.674 --> 59:12.261
<i>And when you're done
Getting knocked down</i>

59:12.261 --> 59:16.557
- That's it. Now I like it. Now I'm happy.
- <i>And when you're done getting up again</i>

59:17.599 --> 59:21.603
<i>And when you're down
On the canvas, baby</i>

59:21.603 --> 59:24.231
<i>I'll be the one that never counts</i>

59:24.231 --> 59:26.066
- <i>Your heart out</i>
- What about "Flora and her Son"?

59:27.317 --> 59:28.569
"Flora and her Son"?

59:29.069 --> 59:30.612
What about "Max and his Ma"?

59:30.612 --> 59:34.116
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:34.825 --> 59:37.786
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:38.704 --> 59:46.503
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:47.129 --> 59:51.258
<i>I'll be the one
I'll be the one</i>

59:51.258 --> 59:52.759
<i>I'll be the one
I'll--</i>

59:55.345 --> 59:56.597
<i>Now send that to her.</i>

59:59.766 --> 01:00:03.979
Fuck! I need the room.
I'm late for my lesson.

01:00:04.646 --> 01:00:06.064
I can't. I'm editing the video.

01:00:06.648 --> 01:00:08.275
What about my lesson, Max?

01:00:08.275 --> 01:00:09.443
I can't help you.

01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:32.799
<i>I worked on that idea of yours.
For my song.</i>

01:00:32.799 --> 01:00:34.384
- <i>You wanna hear it?</i>
- Yeah.

01:00:35.052 --> 01:00:36.595
<i>You got your lyrics handy?</i>

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:55.531
<i>Get in my car
I'll drive you through the canyon</i>

01:00:56.782 --> 01:00:59.993
<i>Breathe in Topanga for the day</i>

01:01:02.704 --> 01:01:05.207
<i>And when we reach the ocean</i>

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:07.960
<i>And we can't go further west</i>

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.631
<i>We'll keep on driving anyway</i>

01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:14.716
<i>Now you go ahead.</i>

01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:20.931
<i>I'll take you down to Dollymount</i>

01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:25.811
<i>And we'll fuck behind the dunes</i>

01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:33.360
<i>I'll kiss your mouth
All whiskey breath</i>

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:38.323
<i>And then I'll leave
Your heart in ruins</i>

01:01:38.323 --> 01:01:39.283
<i>Sing with me.</i>

01:01:39.283 --> 01:01:41.827
<i>Maybe we should meet
In the middle</i>

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:51.211
<i>Maybe we could find
A little city no one knows</i>

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.759
<i>And if they just gave us
A minute on our own</i>

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.929
<i>Maybe we could call it home</i>

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:11.690
<i>Forget the stars of Hollywood</i>

01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:16.695
<i>Or big old houses in Bel Air</i>

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:24.786
<i>I can introduce you
To the angels of my city</i>

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:29.124
<i>But we'll find them anywhere</i>

01:02:31.502 --> 01:02:37.090
<i>I'll drag you around town by your ear</i>

01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:41.803
<i>Still wringing from the rain</i>

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:49.728
<i>I'll buy you chips and tea and beer</i>

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:54.608
<i>And then I'll crush your heart again</i>

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:58.111
<i>Maybe we should meet
In the middle</i>

01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:07.287
<i>Maybe we could find
A little city no one knows</i>

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:13.585
<i>And if we just gave us
A minute on our own</i>

01:03:16.129 --> 01:03:20.509
<i>A minute on our own</i>

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:23.846
<i>Maybe we could call it home</i>

01:03:27.599 --> 01:03:32.813
<i>Maybe we could call it home</i>

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:39.862
So now it just needs a killer bridge.

01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:42.030
What's a bridge?

01:03:42.948 --> 01:03:47.828
A bridge is a change for eight bars
after the second chorus.

01:03:49.246 --> 01:03:50.247
Okay.

01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:53.709
- It sounds amazing.
- It's better, right?

01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:55.669
Yeah. It actually works.

01:03:56.712 --> 01:03:58.463
I really struggled with that song.

01:03:59.756 --> 01:04:03.677
It's very intimate, isn't it?
Singing together like that.

01:04:05.804 --> 01:04:06.805
It's a bit like...

01:04:09.266 --> 01:04:10.809
we've just made love or something.

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:13.979
- No, it's not like that.
- In a way though.

01:04:15.063 --> 01:04:17.816
I do feel a little bit naked right now.

01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:21.028
I think music is all about romance.

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.489
I mean, look at <i>A Star is Born</i>.

01:04:25.657 --> 01:04:26.950
Not if I don't have to.

01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:32.206
How come the way things are
are never enough for you?

01:04:33.207 --> 01:04:37.461
They never were.
I was always pushing things.

01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:40.130
- Finding ways of getting outside meself.
- Like how?

01:04:42.132 --> 01:04:42.966
Like...

01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:47.012
leaving school before everyone else.

01:04:49.181 --> 01:04:52.434
And then getting pregnant
and not getting an abortion

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.394
when everyone was telling me to.

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:58.941
I thought getting pregnant
might make me feel different.

01:05:00.692 --> 01:05:04.112
I thought giving birth, I'd be reborn.

01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:08.534
Then I was stoned during most
of his childhood.

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:12.412
I was drunk for the birth of both my kids.

01:05:12.412 --> 01:05:13.705
Like in a bar?

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:16.333
- Like in the delivery room.
- Wow.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:20.170
That's hard-core.
Bet your wife loved that.

01:05:20.170 --> 01:05:24.132
Right? She's the one pushing
a nine-pound human through her vagina,

01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:26.510
and I'm the one that's breaking.

01:05:30.472 --> 01:05:32.391
Never admitted that to anybody before.

01:05:34.142 --> 01:05:38.272
I was drunk
the whole first ten years of their lives.

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.024
What got you clean?

01:05:41.024 --> 01:05:44.903
Well, having kids started it,
and AA kept me off.

01:05:44.903 --> 01:05:48.240
And really just learning
to put them first.

01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:56.790
- Is that the dawn behind you?
- Christ, it is.

01:05:57.916 --> 01:06:00.544
- Is that the sunset behind you?
- Uh-huh.

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:02.379
We've been up all night.

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:07.092
So, this is like pillow talk?

01:06:07.092 --> 01:06:09.094
No, you owe me for six hours.

01:06:10.262 --> 01:06:11.263
I do not.

01:06:11.763 --> 01:06:13.307
No, I like talking to you.

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:16.727
I don't know why,
'cause nothing you say makes any sense.

01:06:21.398 --> 01:06:22.399
Is that all?

01:06:23.859 --> 01:06:25.611
Nothing's ever enough for you, is it?

01:06:26.987 --> 01:06:29.823
Are you saying you don't
find me a teeny bit attractive

01:06:29.823 --> 01:06:32.159
- when I'm singing that song with you?
- You're my student.

01:06:32.159 --> 01:06:33.785
- So?
- It's inappropriate.

01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:36.705
Who's going to cancel you?
You're already no one.

01:06:42.503 --> 01:06:44.505
I don't think I could
start something with somebody

01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:46.298
halfway across the planet,
through a screen.

01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:49.343
My heart couldn't take it.

01:06:51.261 --> 01:06:52.429
I'm not 19.

01:06:53.764 --> 01:06:55.265
Life's lonely enough as it is.

01:07:01.438 --> 01:07:02.439
I could get a plane.

01:07:05.734 --> 01:07:06.735
So could I.

01:07:07.611 --> 01:07:08.862
Well, then we'd miss each other.

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:11.740
You're not coming here.

01:07:12.241 --> 01:07:14.535
It would be like walking
into a live soap opera.

01:07:16.078 --> 01:07:19.373
Plus, I wanna see LA.
This isn't all about you.

01:07:25.838 --> 01:07:28.090
I could play our song
for some friends in the business.

01:07:30.008 --> 01:07:31.093
Ten percent.

01:07:34.429 --> 01:07:36.014
<i>I'd pick you up at the airport.</i>

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.101
You'd better.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:41.562
<i>Get yourself over here then.</i>

01:08:15.971 --> 01:08:19.933
So, what's so important it couldn't wait
till we swap him over?

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:21.768
Sit down. Relax.

01:08:29.067 --> 01:08:31.862
- Want a glass of wine?
- Wine, Flora?

01:08:31.862 --> 01:08:34.238
At ten o'clock in the morning? No.

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.122
Few gurgles during the day.

01:08:46.417 --> 01:08:48.337
How would you feel
about looking after Max for a bit?

01:08:49.004 --> 01:08:51.298
While I sorta found meself.

01:08:52.131 --> 01:08:53.550
I didn't know you were lost.

01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:57.970
Yeah, well, I haven't left Dublin in,
like, ten years.

01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:00.765
Where you thinking of going? Cork? Galway?

01:09:01.892 --> 01:09:04.978
Yeah. Or LA, or--

01:09:04.978 --> 01:09:08.982
What? Could you pick
somewhere further away?

01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:10.484
That's sort of the point.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:13.319
I see.

01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:17.491
This is about
the fucking guitar guy, is it? Jeff.

01:09:18.158 --> 01:09:20.661
I don't even know if he lives in LA.
This is about me.

01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:22.787
Look, it doesn't matter.

01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:25.374
Can't be looking after Max.

01:09:25.374 --> 01:09:27.584
You couldn't have picked
a worse fucking time.

01:09:27.584 --> 01:09:28.794
Why?

01:09:29.377 --> 01:09:32.464
I'm starting up a wedding band
with the lads outta Indigo Void.

01:09:34.258 --> 01:09:38.470
Imagine this now, all right,
me and the lads all in tuxes, shades on.

01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:45.060
A whole fucking Rat Pack, Tarantino vibe.
Fucking savage.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:47.229
The beach is down the road from his house.

01:09:48.772 --> 01:09:50.064
And it's constantly sunny.

01:09:50.941 --> 01:09:54.278
And he has a pool in his yard
that he put in himself.

01:09:55.028 --> 01:09:57.865
Imagine Ian doing that.
He'd fucking drown.

01:09:57.865 --> 01:10:00.868
Do you know it's been 12 years
since I had a bathing suit on?

01:10:00.868 --> 01:10:02.911
You lucky bitch. Can I come?

01:10:02.911 --> 01:10:04.746
And if things don't work out, that's fine.

01:10:05.247 --> 01:10:06.456
I just come home, right?

01:10:07.249 --> 01:10:09.710
But I get to say I did something brave.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:13.797
For once in me life. Something about me.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.301
Hasn't most of your life
been a little bit about you?

01:10:17.801 --> 01:10:19.970
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:23.223
I'm just saying, like,
you've always followed your own thing.

01:10:23.807 --> 01:10:25.434
Are you for me or against me?

01:10:25.434 --> 01:10:28.395
Look, I'm totally into you going
to LA to fuck this guy.

01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:31.815
Maybe get your song heard
by a couple of friends of his.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:34.026
Totally into that story.

01:10:34.526 --> 01:10:37.821
But last time I checked,
miners and frontline workers were brave.

01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:41.033
Speaking of brave...

01:10:43.285 --> 01:10:44.995
would you look after Max for a bit?

01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:46.496
Excuse me?

01:10:47.414 --> 01:10:49.750
You've known him his whole life.
He trusts you.

01:10:51.043 --> 01:10:53.921
Plus, you have that spare room
since your brother moved out.

01:10:55.297 --> 01:10:57.674
- It's only for a month or so.
- No, I can't.

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:00.719
- I wouldn't ask just anyone.
- Yeah, you would.

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:02.012
What do you mean by that?

01:11:03.889 --> 01:11:08.060
I have a job. I live with me mam.
I have Shania.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:09.561
Much and all as I love you,

01:11:09.561 --> 01:11:11.146
I can't be looking after
your nutter son as well.

01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:13.315
I've never asked you
to do anything with Max.

01:11:13.315 --> 01:11:15.609
Yeah, but I was there
for if you needed me to.

01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:18.904
That's not good enough. You never offered.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.782
Everyone says they care.

01:11:22.491 --> 01:11:25.452
Every bloke I've met is all,
"You have a kid.

01:11:25.452 --> 01:11:28.497
Deadly. Let's give it a go.
I'll rise to the occasion."

01:11:28.497 --> 01:11:30.040
And then they fucking disappear.

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:34.002
And all me so-called mates are like,
"You and Max are so cute."

01:11:34.002 --> 01:11:35.963
But then they're off to Spain
on their holidays,

01:11:35.963 --> 01:11:37.840
and "they don't take kids at this resort."

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.133
Or ask them
to fucking do something for you,

01:11:40.133 --> 01:11:41.802
and they're nowhere to be found.

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:44.847
They never babysat.
They never picked him up from school.

01:11:44.847 --> 01:11:47.850
They never asked me what I might want
or what my needs are.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:50.978
Since I was 17,
with a screaming child on me lap,

01:11:50.978 --> 01:11:54.106
doing me head in, while youse were all
living your fucking lives.

01:11:55.107 --> 01:11:56.525
Now I want to live my life!

01:11:56.525 --> 01:11:59.069
Should have thought about that
14 years ago, shouldn't you?

01:11:59.069 --> 01:12:00.612
Do you think I wanted that child?

01:12:00.612 --> 01:12:02.573
We were all fucking like rabbits.
So I don't know.

01:12:02.573 --> 01:12:04.199
Maybe you did. Maybe you didn't.

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:06.451
But you didn't get the boat
to London, did you?

01:12:06.952 --> 01:12:10.080
That was your call. Now don't be asking
other people to pick up the pieces.

01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:28.432
Hey!

01:12:28.432 --> 01:12:29.474
Stop him!

01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:46.742
- Hello?
- <i>Flora, it's Guard O'Connelly here.</i>

01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:48.827
<i>We have Max again at the station.
Can you come down?</i>

01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:50.537
For fuck's sake.

01:12:58.003 --> 01:12:58.837
Right.

01:12:58.837 --> 01:13:02.549
So young Max here stole
an expensive piece of studio equipment

01:13:02.549 --> 01:13:05.427
from a shop on Wicklow Street,
causing the shop owner to give chase.

01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:08.138
- How expensive was it?
- That's not the point.

01:13:08.889 --> 01:13:10.891
He's way past the number
of thefts and charges

01:13:10.891 --> 01:13:13.977
where we can keep him out of court
and very likely a correctional facility.

01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:15.979
- Are you joking me?
- No.

01:13:17.523 --> 01:13:19.441
Guard,
there's gotta be some way to fix this.

01:13:19.441 --> 01:13:21.610
- You're all he's got.
- No, Flora, I'm done with him.

01:13:21.610 --> 01:13:23.820
He's been robbing
since he's been in short trousers.

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.905
He's a waste of space.

01:13:24.905 --> 01:13:28.242
There's a time when you run out of road,
and it's that time.

01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:31.161
Like I said, I've tried everything.

01:13:34.039 --> 01:13:35.374
And so have you, Flora.

01:13:35.374 --> 01:13:36.458
Good luck, kid.

01:13:38.752 --> 01:13:40.838
Lads, get that fella up
from the cell there.

01:13:40.838 --> 01:13:42.714
I want him in Interview Two, yeah?

01:13:45.884 --> 01:13:48.387
A fucking 400-euro synthesizer?

01:13:48.387 --> 01:13:50.681
- I told you I needed the right gear.
- For what?

01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:53.684
To rerecord that song. It sounded rubbish.

01:13:54.434 --> 01:13:58.689
Who are you, fucking Drake?
It's just a bleeding song on your laptop.

01:13:59.815 --> 01:14:01.358
Did you not send her your video?

01:14:01.358 --> 01:14:05.195
Yeah, I did. She hated it.
She thought it was real creepy.

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:06.905
Well, fuck her then.

01:14:07.698 --> 01:14:08.949
It's all your fault.

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:11.410
Getting me to stare
into the camera all intense.

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:14.621
In me shorts, like a weirdo.
She doesn't want to see that.

01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:16.248
What does she want to see then?

01:14:16.248 --> 01:14:17.499
You wouldn't understand.

01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:20.377
I want to do it right.

01:14:21.128 --> 01:14:24.882
Well, I'm sure she'll give you loads
of attention when you're behind bars.

01:14:24.882 --> 01:14:26.216
Women love criminals.

01:14:26.717 --> 01:14:30.262
Oh, for fuck's sake.
What movie are you in?

01:14:30.762 --> 01:14:33.599
One without you in it.
I mean, what do you care?

01:14:33.599 --> 01:14:35.267
You'll be in LA with your boyfriend.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:36.685
He's not my boyfriend.

01:14:37.853 --> 01:14:39.354
Anyway, how do you know about that?

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:40.939
We live in a fucking shoebox.

01:14:41.648 --> 01:14:42.858
I'll be grand with that.

01:14:42.858 --> 01:14:44.693
You know, just get out of me way, woman.

01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:46.987
Gladly!

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:54.369
I've just come
from his free legal aid lawyer.

01:14:55.078 --> 01:14:57.539
They say he's defo gonna serve some time.

01:14:57.539 --> 01:15:00.792
Little fucking bollocks.
He's been given so many chances.

01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:03.962
I know.
Do you wanna let on we're still together?

01:15:05.464 --> 01:15:08.342
When we stand up in court.
Judges like that.

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.761
Yeah.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:16.683
Flora, look-- Those places get a bad rep,

01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:19.728
but they're not what they used to be,
you know.

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:22.189
They're more like a school now
than a detention center.

01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:28.403
They've got football pitches in them.
Art shit. Wi-Fi.

01:15:29.279 --> 01:15:32.366
They're very fucking progressive,
you know.

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.785
It might be the best thing for him.

01:15:35.285 --> 01:15:39.665
Just having to man up,
you know, look out for himself.

01:15:40.415 --> 01:15:43.210
Make friends. Negotiate. People skills.

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:46.046
He's just been sitting around
on his hole doing nothing.

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:49.508
But this would give us
the time we were talking about.

01:15:50.592 --> 01:15:54.304
For your dreams and my various projects.

01:15:55.556 --> 01:15:58.350
We've been doing nothing
but parenting him for the last 14 years.

01:15:59.268 --> 01:16:01.019
How's he gonna have any respect for us

01:16:01.019 --> 01:16:02.855
if we're just waiting around on him
all the time?

01:16:03.647 --> 01:16:04.982
He needs to know who I am.

01:16:06.942 --> 01:16:08.777
And he needs to know who you are, Flora.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:11.947
I'll see you in court on Tuesday.

01:16:15.826 --> 01:16:16.827
This way.

01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:24.126
Can you see me?
I don't think you fucking care.

01:16:24.126 --> 01:16:25.502
Could you hurry up, please?

01:16:25.502 --> 01:16:27.546
Thank you very fucking much for your time.

01:16:27.546 --> 01:16:29.965
Treating us like criminals.
Following us out. Do you mind?

01:16:29.965 --> 01:16:31.925
I'll tell you something.
She better not come in here...

01:16:33.677 --> 01:16:36.221
- Did you text him?
- Yeah, twice.

01:16:37.389 --> 01:16:38.557
I'll text him again.

01:16:38.557 --> 01:16:41.059
Pick up your phone, you fucking asshole.

01:16:41.059 --> 01:16:42.644
This is the one thing you need to be at,

01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:45.230
and you're sitting
on your arse playing video games.

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:47.482
I've been texting you all morning,
you fucking asshole.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:48.567
Get over here.

01:16:51.528 --> 01:16:53.363
This case is now adjourned.

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:59.536
Next case on the ballot
is the state versus...

01:17:00.329 --> 01:17:02.289
Can the defendant please step forward?

01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:39.243
Next case on the ballot is Max Mulvey.

01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:44.456
Any previous offenses?

01:17:44.456 --> 01:17:45.916
Six.

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:52.256
Max is an excellent student
when he applies himself.

01:17:53.465 --> 01:17:55.467
There's been drug use
with both his parents.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:59.596
His father is a musician,
but the band split up

01:17:59.596 --> 01:18:01.515
and he's struggled ever since.

01:18:01.515 --> 01:18:06.270
His mother
has been holding down various jobs as a--

01:18:06.270 --> 01:18:09.314
a mother's helper.
Commutes an hour a day.

01:18:10.274 --> 01:18:12.693
He excels in music--

01:18:12.693 --> 01:18:14.611
I presume you're the defendant's mother?

01:18:14.611 --> 01:18:16.071
Yes, Judge.

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.532
His father was supposed
to be here as well,

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:20.284
but he couldn't get out of work.

01:18:20.284 --> 01:18:21.743
He lives with you both?

01:18:21.743 --> 01:18:24.454
Yes, we both live with him. At two houses.

01:18:24.454 --> 01:18:27.332
- We both take care of him.
- I asked where Max lived.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:30.544
Yes, Judge, he lives with both of us.

01:18:30.544 --> 01:18:33.881
But at two houses, mine and me husband's.

01:18:35.549 --> 01:18:38.594
It seems to me a couple of months
in a strict supervision environment

01:18:38.594 --> 01:18:41.889
might teach you to respect
the efforts your parents have made.

01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:47.019
I'm going to impose
an eight-week sentence on you, Mr. Mulvey,

01:18:47.019 --> 01:18:51.148
in a juvenile correctional facility,
and one year's probation.

01:18:52.399 --> 01:18:53.901
I hope you learn your lesson in there,

01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:56.320
and that I won't be seeing you again
in my courtroom.

01:18:57.779 --> 01:18:59.573
- I don't care.
- Good man.

01:18:59.573 --> 01:19:01.033
That's very harsh.

01:19:02.910 --> 01:19:05.204
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.

01:19:05.704 --> 01:19:06.872
Are you a mother?

01:19:06.872 --> 01:19:09.166
- Completely irrelevant.
- Right.

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:12.377
But I believe if I weren't,
I would have imposed a harsher sentence.

01:19:12.878 --> 01:19:14.463
If the shop owner has his gear back,

01:19:14.463 --> 01:19:16.423
- what's the point in sending him in there?
- Madam--

01:19:16.423 --> 01:19:18.509
I'll do whatever it takes
to figure this out.

01:19:18.509 --> 01:19:19.885
And what would that be?

01:19:20.802 --> 01:19:23.722
I have 500 euros put away.
I can give it to the shop owner.

01:19:24.389 --> 01:19:27.267
And if he's satisfied with that,
then he might drop the charges.

01:19:27.267 --> 01:19:31.104
Otherwise, what's the point in sending him
in there and breaking up me family?

01:19:33.023 --> 01:19:34.358
Without him, I have nothing.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.443
The owner isn't here.

01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:38.820
And this is a legal matter,
not a financial one.

01:19:39.404 --> 01:19:42.366
Max has been on the liaison program
for half his life.

01:19:42.366 --> 01:19:45.994
I'd be making a mockery of it
if I didn't impose a custodial sentence.

01:19:46.495 --> 01:19:49.248
But in the light of your efforts,
I'll reduce it.

01:19:50.249 --> 01:19:52.751
Four weeks and a year's probation.

01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:03.136
- You did brilliant.
- No, I didn't.

01:20:04.763 --> 01:20:07.599
- I'll be grand in there.
- No, you won't.

01:20:08.392 --> 01:20:09.810
I will now, Ma.

01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:16.859
Thanks, Ma.

01:20:19.987 --> 01:20:21.071
Okay, Son.

01:20:23.866 --> 01:20:25.033
You're okay.

01:20:39.256 --> 01:20:41.466
So, I'm not coming to visit you.

01:20:42.634 --> 01:20:45.387
When he gets out I might come,
but I'd have to bring him.

01:20:47.055 --> 01:20:47.931
<i>How annoying is he?</i>

01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:50.100
Very annoying.

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:51.185
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:20:53.353 --> 01:20:55.898
<i>Oh, shit. I'm not gonna be able
to play you my song.</i>

01:20:55.898 --> 01:20:57.232
Which song?

01:20:57.232 --> 01:20:58.567
<i>The song I wrote about you.</i>

01:20:59.193 --> 01:21:01.445
- You wrote a song about me?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:02.529 --> 01:21:03.906
<i>It's about, you know,</i>

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:06.867
<i>your soul and the time we've spent
and who you are.</i>

01:21:07.701 --> 01:21:08.702
What's it called?

01:21:09.661 --> 01:21:10.954
<i>"Crazy Irish Bitch."</i>

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.336
<i>I haven't written a new song
in a long time.</i>

01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:20.589
<i>I just didn't feel like I had much
to write about in life,</i>

01:21:20.589 --> 01:21:24.134
<i>but I did, I guess. So thanks.</i>

01:21:24.718 --> 01:21:25.719
You're welcome.

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.222
So I'm your muse?

01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:29.848
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:21:30.516 --> 01:21:33.101
<i>Although nowadays you're supposed
to be offended by that, right?</i>

01:21:33.101 --> 01:21:36.063
Fuck that. Feels great. I wanna hear it.

01:21:37.523 --> 01:21:38.732
<i>I'll record it for you.</i>

01:22:01.547 --> 01:22:03.549
Hi, Judge. Do you have a second?

01:22:04.049 --> 01:22:06.343
I'm the mad one from court the other week.

01:22:06.343 --> 01:22:08.136
I know who you are. What is it?

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:11.265
Would you just make one small change
to your sentence?

01:22:11.849 --> 01:22:14.518
It's just a detail,
but you could help make it happen.

01:22:14.518 --> 01:22:15.435
What is it?

01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:18.063
Would you let him
bring his music stuff with him?

01:22:18.564 --> 01:22:21.400
The info pack says
there's no personal items,

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:23.735
but he has his headphones
and a microphone.

01:22:24.653 --> 01:22:27.531
I think it will be very good for him
to continue with his music,

01:22:28.031 --> 01:22:30.075
especially with all this time
on his hands.

01:22:30.576 --> 01:22:32.619
I don't see why I couldn't look into that.

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:44.590
- That's the one you want?
- Yeah.

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:47.426
That's the one Keith has. It's class.

01:22:47.426 --> 01:22:49.136
And that's a good microphone?

01:22:50.137 --> 01:22:52.848
Yeah, it's very good
for GarageBand and that.

01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:54.766
It's an all-round good mic.

01:23:05.402 --> 01:23:06.403
Thanks very much.

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:10.991
Little prick.

01:24:10.425 --> 01:24:13.846
<i>Here, Ma. Check this out
It's just a rough vocal.</i>

01:24:13.846 --> 01:24:15.764
<i>Living in my life</i>

01:24:17.599 --> 01:24:20.018
<i>Living in my hard life</i>

01:24:21.186 --> 01:24:23.522
<i>Living in my life</i>

01:24:36.660 --> 01:24:39.746
...ready to take your order
whenever you're ready.

01:24:56.638 --> 01:24:59.850
Sorry, you're telling me
that the day you did the very thing

01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:01.685
that you got locked up for

01:25:02.603 --> 01:25:04.771
- was the best day of your life?
- Yeah, hands down.

01:25:05.272 --> 01:25:08.483
I felt like I was on fire meself.
I felt alive that day.

01:25:09.359 --> 01:25:12.738
Well, the best day of my life
is the day I get out of this kip.

01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:14.531
Yeah, but that's in the future.

01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:15.908
I'm talking about up to now.

01:25:16.491 --> 01:25:18.452
Well, I haven't had a good day, have I?

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:22.164
What about you, Max?

01:25:22.664 --> 01:25:26.460
Best day of my life was the day
I made a video with me ma.

01:25:27.002 --> 01:25:28.629
You made a video with your mother?

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:30.506
- Yeah.
- Well, can we see it?

01:25:30.506 --> 01:25:31.590
No.

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:33.800
All right, but that's your day?

01:25:34.843 --> 01:25:37.262
Yeah, that was a good day.

01:26:52.337 --> 01:26:54.339
Okay, I'm gonna have
to park this thing properly.

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:57.134
So I'll see youse inside, all right?
Good luck.

01:26:57.759 --> 01:26:59.720
- Get up with us.
- No.

01:26:59.720 --> 01:27:00.721
- I'll be at the bar.
- Come on.

01:27:00.721 --> 01:27:02.014
Come on. It'll be great.

01:27:02.014 --> 01:27:04.683
Look, no offense, but I'm actually
a professional bass player,

01:27:04.683 --> 01:27:07.936
so I'm not gonna be playing
some random amateur night. Thanks.

01:27:07.936 --> 01:27:11.607
Hey, Da. You weren't at the court.
You have to do this.

01:27:14.109 --> 01:27:15.110
I don't even have me bass.

01:27:15.110 --> 01:27:17.279
I packed it. It's in the back seat.

01:27:17.779 --> 01:27:19.489
Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:27:19.489 --> 01:27:21.783
You're not getting out of this one, Ian.

01:27:21.783 --> 01:27:24.328
<i>Strawberry moon</i>

01:27:24.328 --> 01:27:28.749
<i>Oh, you shine down
You shine down on me</i>

01:27:30.250 --> 01:27:34.004
<i>Another strawberry moon</i>

01:27:52.105 --> 01:27:54.191
- Give it up for Heart.
- Yeah!

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:58.028
Amazing, isn't she?
Long career ahead of her.

01:27:58.028 --> 01:28:01.907
Now, next up we have "Flora and Son."

01:28:01.907 --> 01:28:03.909
Is that the name of the band? Yeah.

01:28:03.909 --> 01:28:05.285
Flora and Son.

01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:11.667
That's a lot of gear.
Yeah, man, all right.

01:28:16.672 --> 01:28:18.507
- Hey, Jeff.
- Watch this.

01:28:25.222 --> 01:28:28.058
- Are you not gonna be roasting in that?
- Shut up, no. I'll be grand.

01:28:30.269 --> 01:28:34.147
Hiya. This is Jeff.

01:28:34.147 --> 01:28:36.608
He's in LA. Say hello, Jeff.

01:28:36.608 --> 01:28:37.860
<i>Hello, Dublin.</i>

01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.446
<i>Always wanted to say that.</i>

01:28:41.446 --> 01:28:44.283
And this is Ian on bass.

01:28:45.033 --> 01:28:47.703
And Max, me son, on keyboards.

01:28:48.620 --> 01:28:52.374
We wrote this song together.
Jeff helped. And Ian, sorta.

01:28:53.834 --> 01:28:57.212
But we thought we'd try it
live for you, if that's all right.

01:28:58.505 --> 01:29:00.966
Okay. I've never done this before.

01:29:00.966 --> 01:29:03.177
I've had diarrhea all week
leading up to this.

01:29:03.177 --> 01:29:04.511
<i>Don't be nervous.</i>

01:29:04.511 --> 01:29:06.430
It's easy for you to say.
This is a Dublin crowd.

01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:07.890
They'll savage me if I fuck it up.

01:29:08.891 --> 01:29:10.017
Okay, you ready?

01:29:11.059 --> 01:29:13.145
One, two, three, four.

01:29:27.868 --> 01:29:34.249
<i>I've been bruised and broken
I've been torn in fucking two</i>

01:29:35.542 --> 01:29:38.670
<i>I've been working and running</i>

01:29:39.630 --> 01:29:42.174
<i>Then I have to run home to you</i>

01:29:43.383 --> 01:29:47.095
<i>And I'm not living in your life</i>

01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:50.140
<i>And you're not living in mine</i>

01:29:50.849 --> 01:29:54.269
<i>We've been getting it wrong forever</i>

01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:57.898
<i>We'll get it right this time</i>

01:29:57.898 --> 01:30:00.651
<i>And live in the high life</i>

01:30:10.327 --> 01:30:13.330
Absolutely not.

01:30:13.956 --> 01:30:17.626
<i>You're a thief
You're a shit thief</i>

01:30:18.335 --> 01:30:20.671
<i>You're always getting caught</i>

01:30:21.630 --> 01:30:25.092
<i>I'm a bitch
But I'm your bitch</i>

01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:28.053
<i>And I'm all you've fucking got</i>

01:30:29.513 --> 01:30:33.058
<i>And I'm not living in your life</i>

01:30:33.684 --> 01:30:36.186
<i>And you're not living in mine</i>

01:30:37.062 --> 01:30:40.524
<i>We all get what we've been given</i>

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:43.569
<i>But we're not gonna give up tryin'</i>

01:30:44.236 --> 01:30:46.363
<i>To live in the high life</i>

01:30:48.282 --> 01:30:51.159
<i>Living in our high life</i>

01:30:51.869 --> 01:30:54.371
<i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:30:56.081 --> 01:30:59.126
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:30:59.835 --> 01:31:01.879
<i>Living the high life</i>

01:31:03.714 --> 01:31:06.425
<i>Living in our high life</i>

01:31:07.342 --> 01:31:09.720
<i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:31:11.346 --> 01:31:14.725
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:31:19.563 --> 01:31:23.025
<i>This song's a love song</i>

01:31:23.817 --> 01:31:24.943
It's not an apology.

01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:30.324
<i>But sometimes I hate you</i>

01:31:31.283 --> 01:31:33.744
<i>Reminding me of me</i>

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:37.497
<i>Woman, guess we're cut
From the same cloth</i>

01:31:37.497 --> 01:31:39.625
<i>Fourteen years in the same block</i>

01:31:39.625 --> 01:31:41.001
<i>Nine long months in your belly</i>

01:31:41.001 --> 01:31:43.253
<i>Down to the Coombe
And I still wasn't ready</i>

01:31:43.253 --> 01:31:45.047
<i>Three days late I arrived at the party</i>

01:31:45.047 --> 01:31:47.132
<i>Smile on me face
You're welcome, me hearty</i>

01:31:47.132 --> 01:31:48.884
<i>Back to the gaff in the Liberties</i>

01:31:48.884 --> 01:31:50.761
<i>Christening party
Up with the knees</i>

01:31:50.761 --> 01:31:53.138
<i>Girl, we are cut from the same cloth</i>

01:31:53.138 --> 01:31:55.098
<i>All you feel, I feel the same loss</i>

01:31:55.098 --> 01:31:58.227
<i>I see your eyes in the mirror
Saint, angel, devil, sinner</i>

01:31:58.810 --> 01:32:00.479
<i>Still laughin' at life
With our fists up</i>

01:32:00.479 --> 01:32:02.439
<i>Still getting our tea
Down the chip shop</i>

01:32:02.439 --> 01:32:04.650
<i>Still tough
Tongues sharp as a flick-knife</i>

01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:06.443
<i>Still here, still living the high life</i>

01:32:06.443 --> 01:32:09.446
<i>And I'm not living in your life</i>

01:32:09.446 --> 01:32:12.074
<i>And you're not living in mine</i>

01:32:13.158 --> 01:32:16.787
<i>And this song's for all you mothers</i>

01:32:17.538 --> 01:32:19.873
<i>We're all gonna be just fine</i>

01:32:24.294 --> 01:32:26.421
<i>We're living the high life</i>

01:32:27.965 --> 01:32:30.926
<i>Living in our high life</i>

01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:34.096
<i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:32:35.973 --> 01:32:39.726
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:32:39.726 --> 01:32:43.689
- <i>We're living the high life</i>
- <i>Living the high life</i>

01:32:43.689 --> 01:32:47.568
- <i>Living in our high life</i>
- <i>Living in our...</i>

01:32:47.568 --> 01:32:51.363
- <i>We're up on the high life</i>
- <i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:32:51.363 --> 01:32:54.366
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:32:55.242 --> 01:32:57.244
<i>Living the high life</i>

01:32:57.244 --> 01:32:58.495
Living the high life!

01:32:59.079 --> 01:33:01.456
<i>Living in our high life</i>

01:33:02.666 --> 01:33:05.127
- <i>We're up on the high life</i>
- Max!

01:33:06.712 --> 01:33:08.881
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:33:08.881 --> 01:33:10.716
And it's a fine night to feel alive!

01:33:10.716 --> 01:33:13.385
- <i>Living the high life</i>
- Top of the world, Ma.

01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:16.847
<i>Living in our high life</i>

01:33:18.056 --> 01:33:20.142
<i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:33:22.102 --> 01:33:25.189
<i>And it's a fine night to feel alive</i>

01:33:26.023 --> 01:33:27.941
<i>Living the high life</i>

01:33:29.902 --> 01:33:31.778
<i>Living the high life</i>

01:33:33.405 --> 01:33:35.657
<i>We're up on the high life</i>

01:33:41.038 --> 01:33:43.081
You're fucking shite.

01:33:56.178 --> 01:34:00.682
<i>Hey. So here's
that song I was telling you about,</i>

01:34:00.682 --> 01:34:04.603
<i>that I wanted to play for you
when you got here.</i>

01:34:06.021 --> 01:34:07.481
<i>But I guess I'll play it now.</i>

01:34:17.574 --> 01:34:20.118
<i>If I said purple</i>

01:34:21.119 --> 01:34:23.288
<i>You'd say red</i>

01:34:24.414 --> 01:34:30.379
<i>With your brown hair tumbling
Like an unmade bed</i>

01:34:31.338 --> 01:34:34.341
<i>Then we'd both die laughing</i>

01:34:34.341 --> 01:34:38.011
<i>At something I said</i>

01:34:39.763 --> 01:34:43.308
<i>Talking to you</i>

01:34:45.978 --> 01:34:48.397
<i>I find my point</i>

01:34:49.314 --> 01:34:51.692
<i>And you lose your shit</i>

01:34:52.651 --> 01:34:55.737
<i>There's just so much broken</i>

01:34:55.737 --> 01:34:58.991
<i>That the words can't fix</i>

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:02.578
<i>And the dawn is breaking</i>

01:35:02.578 --> 01:35:05.914
<i>But I just can't quit</i>

01:35:07.916 --> 01:35:11.003
<i>Talking to you</i>

01:35:13.338 --> 01:35:15.841
<i>I've seen a Jesus</i>

01:35:15.841 --> 01:35:20.429
<i>Roller skating down Sunset</i>

01:35:20.929 --> 01:35:24.391
<i>Watched a ballet of sprinklers</i>

01:35:24.391 --> 01:35:25.726
<i>In the rain</i>

01:35:27.769 --> 01:35:31.315
<i>But I know I'd go crazy</i>

01:35:31.315 --> 01:35:34.610
<i>If I couldn't get</i>

01:35:36.153 --> 01:35:39.823
<i>To talk to you again</i>

01:35:42.075 --> 01:35:44.328
<i>So if God takes me</i>

01:35:45.829 --> 01:35:48.248
<i>And leaves you here</i>

01:35:49.124 --> 01:35:52.669
<i>I want no black limousines</i>

01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:55.255
<i>And no sad tears</i>

01:35:56.465 --> 01:35:59.676
<i>'Cause I'll still be hanging around</i>

01:35:59.676 --> 01:36:02.346
<i>The atmosphere</i>

01:36:04.556 --> 01:36:08.018
<i>Talking to you</i>

01:36:10.103 --> 01:36:13.273
<i>And no words or music</i>

01:36:13.273 --> 01:36:17.069
<i>Can come even near</i>

01:36:18.487 --> 01:36:22.324
<i>To talking to you</i>
