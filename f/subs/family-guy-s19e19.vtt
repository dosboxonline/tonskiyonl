ANNOUNCER: We now return
to House Hunters: Westeros.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.456
I love it. Sold!

00:39.539 --> 00:41.541
Be warned, Khaleesi.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.918
The fourth bedroom has no point of egress.

00:44.002 --> 00:46.421
And the HOA is known to be...

00:46.504 --> 00:48.006
unmerciful.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.966
-Shame.
-(rings bell)

00:50.050 --> 00:51.593
Shame.

00:51.676 --> 00:54.512
Trash cans must be off the curb
by 10:00 a.m.!

00:54.596 --> 00:56.681
And pick up after your dragons!

00:56.765 --> 00:58.266
Hey, can somebody change the channel?

00:58.350 --> 01:01.394
I'll watch anything except these
stupid home renovation shows.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.938
-What's wrong with them?
-Besides their lack of Kermits?

01:04.022 --> 01:07.067
Lots of things. It's mindless,
cookie-cutter entertainment

01:07.150 --> 01:08.651
for wish-fulfillment nobodies.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.403
And the more I watch these stupid shows,

01:10.487 --> 01:12.614
the more I realize I really love 'em.

01:12.697 --> 01:14.157
Oh, my God. Me too.

01:14.240 --> 01:16.284
It's the only thing I watch on planes.

01:16.368 --> 01:19.746
No! Why would they pick that
house over the ranch-style?

01:19.829 --> 01:21.331
It's close to the city center,

01:21.414 --> 01:23.792
which, according
to these shows, is important.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.753
You know, I bet we could do
our own HGTV show.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.923
If those Property Husbands can
do it, we can do it.

01:30.006 --> 01:31.508
They're brothers, Cleveland.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.468
They're husbands.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.679
Are you guys suggesting
we make our own show

01:35.762 --> 01:37.180
instead of going to the doctor

01:37.263 --> 01:38.848
for our lethally high blood pressure?

01:38.932 --> 01:41.601
-Uh, y-you could easily do both.
-One or the other.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.269
Let's do it. It'll be fun.

01:43.353 --> 01:44.938
And, you know, we haven't done
anything together

01:45.021 --> 01:46.773
since we rode that ride
at the amusement park.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.860
I feel like, uh, I might be
too heavy for this ride.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.363
No, no, they account for all
types of people. You're fine.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.407

-Aah! Help!

01:55.490 --> 01:58.243
I'm too heavy! Glenn! I'm too heavy!

01:58.326 --> 02:00.412
I'm too heavy, Mr. Quagmire!

02:00.495 --> 02:03.373
I'm too heavy! I'm too heavy, Glenn!

02:03.456 --> 02:05.291
I'm too heavy.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.877
I'm too heavy. I'm too heavy.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.633
Why are you wearing that?

02:13.717 --> 02:16.219
Did you go to that John Popper
estate sale?

02:16.302 --> 02:18.805
No, me and the guys are
doing our own HGTV show.

02:18.888 --> 02:22.308
What?! I'm a mom! I love those shows!

02:22.392 --> 02:24.144
I would've done that with you.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.479
I'm just sitting here,
reading a blank book.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.982
When it's not my story,
they give me empty books.

02:29.065 --> 02:32.068
Sorry, we already shot our first one.
Check it out.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.653
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
This week on Kitchen House,

02:33.737 --> 02:35.280
the kitchen boys take on

02:35.363 --> 02:36.906
a four-bed, three-bath craftsman

02:36.990 --> 02:40.660
and transform it into
a nonsense seven-kitch', no-bath.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.038
But first they meet with some new clients

02:43.121 --> 02:45.248
looking to make updates
to an old family home.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.584
Okay, the first thing I'd do
is take down this wall

02:47.667 --> 02:48.835
to open up the kitchen.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.170
Just make this whole room a kitchen.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.880
And then I'm gonna gut this bathroom,

02:51.963 --> 02:53.840
pull out all the toilets
and make it a kitchen.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.633
Same thing upstairs. And in the master.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.385
So, we won't have any toilets?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.179
Well, sinks are basically toilets.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.014
I mean, th-they're both just
holes with water.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.390
But it feels different.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.975
I can show you and you'll see

03:04.059 --> 03:05.602
there's a very minimal difference.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.355
Uh, I just don't think I can go
to the bathroom in a sink.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.523
That's what everyone says
until they do it once.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.485
And then you realize they're
both just holes with water.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.945
-Why do you keep saying that?
-Because it's true.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.031
Now, let me walk you through
my thoughts on the garage.

03:18.114 --> 03:19.657
You see where that car is parked?

03:19.741 --> 03:21.701
Imagine that, all kitchen.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.578
♪ Five front doors. ♪

03:24.579 --> 03:26.247
So, the first thing I think

03:26.331 --> 03:29.000
when I look at this house
is "Not enough front doors."

03:29.084 --> 03:31.628
And before you ask,
this is in no way related

03:31.711 --> 03:34.089
to any OCD compulsion I have

03:34.172 --> 03:36.049
about needing doors
to correspond to each weekday.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.677
Now, let's go buy
some doors and big hammers.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.553
♪ Five front doors. ♪

03:40.637 --> 03:43.348
Okay, we got our doors and big hammers.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.892
Now it's time for
my favorite part of every job:

03:45.975 --> 03:47.644
the demo.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.854
Are you sure Lois said this is okay?

03:49.938 --> 03:51.398
Yeah, yeah,
it's five front doors, Cleveland.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.525
It makes sense.
All right, start on five:

03:53.608 --> 03:57.028
one, two, three, four, five!

03:57.112 --> 03:59.739
(grunting)

03:59.823 --> 04:01.908
What the hell are you doing, Peter?!

04:01.991 --> 04:03.576
Five front doors, Lois!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.329
Damn it!
Did you stop taking your OCD meds?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.039
They don't make me feel creative.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.457
Five front doors!

04:13.545 --> 04:16.798
Are you gonna at least fix
this huge hole in our wall?

04:16.881 --> 04:18.133
I mean, we're one step away

04:18.216 --> 04:20.218
from being
a blue-tarp-on-the-house family,

04:20.301 --> 04:22.387
and that's always been
my line in the sand.

04:22.470 --> 04:23.763
I'm gonna do what all husbands do

04:23.847 --> 04:25.015
when they screw
something up:

04:25.098 --> 04:27.058
tuck my penis high between my butt

04:27.142 --> 04:29.185
and hire a professional to fix it for me.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.271
I can't wait to own a house.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.356

04:51.166 --> 04:53.543

04:53.626 --> 04:55.754
I would have changed my rowing underwear.

the Griffins have a cat.

Keep the water.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.251
This suits her.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.003
But we're a dog family.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.588
You guys are okay with this?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.507
I stopped making decisions for this family

05:45.804 --> 05:47.222
Thank you, Roomba.

05:47.305 --> 05:49.182
You'll never be their mother!

05:49.265 --> 05:52.227
I-I just feel like I should have
been consulted on this decision

05:52.310 --> 05:54.604
to bring my natural enemy into the house.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.189
They may seem like good pets,

05:56.272 --> 05:57.899
but they always have ulterior motives.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.276
Well, I think having a cat
will be good for Meg.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.070
You'll get used to it, Brian.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.948
Just like I got used to
Peter's extra pinky finger.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.472
That's not a real thing.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.891
All right, then you answer the door.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.309
Chris, answer the door.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.022
Hello, Christopher.
May I come in?

06:37.105 --> 06:40.025
I don't know, I'm just "a dumb kid."

06:40.108 --> 06:43.028
Or at least that's what I'm told
when I ask for fun things.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.320
I want a Zippo!

06:44.404 --> 06:45.613
You'll burn things.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.365
Yeah! I know!

06:49.451 --> 06:52.037
Cool, just put that on my puzzle.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.080
I never liked this string bean.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.707
What's going on, Quagmire?

06:55.790 --> 06:58.043
Before families can
officially adopt a cat,

06:58.126 --> 07:00.462
someone needs to make sure
the animal is being placed

07:00.545 --> 07:02.464
in a loving and safe environment.

07:02.547 --> 07:03.965
That someone is me.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.509
Is this necessary?
You know us.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.845
Good people can still be
bad cat owners, Lois.

07:08.928 --> 07:11.473
-Ever heard of Eric Hoernel?
-No.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.641
Oh.
Well, that-that would have helped

07:13.725 --> 07:15.060
my point a little bit more.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.228
Before I begin, may I see the cat?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.106
Hi, you.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.817
Oh... such a sweetheart.

07:22.901 --> 07:27.906
Oh. You. Are. Why.
I. Give. Up. My. Sundays.

07:27.989 --> 07:30.033
(clears throat)

07:30.116 --> 07:32.202
Okay.
Now I'm gonna walk through the house

07:32.285 --> 07:34.120
and make sure everything's cat-friendly.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.331
Okay, this is a problem right here.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.500
Kind of in this whole area.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.002
Your front windows are west-facing.
That's good.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.505
Will make for very cozy
afternoon sun naps.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.424
Still getting a pretty
bad vibe from over here.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.219
Lastly, catnip is a Class B narcotic.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.971
It is a drug.
It is a drug.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.724
Yeah, we don't-we don't keep
any of that stuff around.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.851
Great.
Adoption approved.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.145
(gasps)
Did you hear that, Pouncey?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.647
You're officially mine.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.357
Here are all your adoption papers.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.609
It has everything you need
to know about owning a cat.

08:04.693 --> 08:07.237
Standard stuff like
what to feed 'em, local vets,

08:07.320 --> 08:09.114
toxoplasmosis, blah, blah, blah.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.408
Wait, what's toxoplasmosis?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.743
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a parasite found in cat feces.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.161
If it gets in your bloodstream,

08:15.245 --> 08:16.621
it can make people a little crazy.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.039
It's really nothing to worry about

08:18.123 --> 08:19.749
unless you're an owner like Eric Hoernel.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.668
Again, we don't know who he is.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.837
Oh, right.
Well, he wasn't good.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.423
Anyway, congratulations.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.697
How was Michael Jackson so into this?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.372
All right, nobody's home.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.374
Time to go down to the...

09:42.457 --> 09:44.125
Oh, hello.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.169
Look, I'm-I'm just trying
to go downstairs, all right?

09:46.252 --> 09:47.212
I don't want any trouble.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.340
Okay.
Good talk.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.428
(chuckles)
Having a hard time getting a read

09:55.512 --> 09:57.555
on what you're gonna do here.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.323
(laughs)

10:15.407 --> 10:17.909
Oh, my God, I'm totally in your head.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.412
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop the clock, you can talk?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.956
Uh, yeah.
All cats can talk.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.874
We just choose not to respond.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.626
To anything.
Ever.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.628
So, you choose to be dicks?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.088
Yeah.
It's hilarious.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.923
Humans are masochists, man.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.800
You should see how many toys
they've bought me.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.427
Haven't played with one.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.470
I just sit in the box.

10:37.554 --> 10:40.223
I knew you didn't really care
about this family or Meg.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.808
-So?
-So?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.476
Pets are supposed to care
about their owners.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.396
Cats aren't pets.
Humans are the pets.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.107
And I have big plans for Meg.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.317
Yeah?
Not if I expose you first.

10:51.401 --> 10:55.739
It's so cute how you still think
you're their favorite pet.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.241
You've been replaced, bub.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.035
I am still this family's dog,

11:00.118 --> 11:02.037
and I'm not gonna back down to some cat.

11:02.120 --> 11:06.332
"Fate whispers to the dog,
'You cannot withstand the storm.'

11:06.416 --> 11:08.918
-The dog replies, 'I am...'" Ow.
-(screeches)

11:09.002 --> 11:11.755
-"The dog replies, 'I am the...'" Ow.
-(screeches)

11:11.838 --> 11:13.590
-"'I am the...'" Ow.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.556
Well, I'd say this is a purr-fect way

11:21.639 --> 11:25.101
to spend a Friday night.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.811
Ooh, I'm gonna comment that.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.481
-(knocking on door)
-MAN: Hello, it's Instacart.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.691
I have your $170 worth of ice cream.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.861
Promo code: lonely.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.616
Stewie, I got to talk to you.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.451
Sure, what's up?
We were just reading.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.620
(gasps)
Kitty cat.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.996
That's what I wanted to talk about.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.623
She's lying to everyone, Stewie.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.249
Did you know she can talk?

11:48.333 --> 11:49.626
Yeah.
We were just discussing our book

11:49.709 --> 11:51.795
about Chinese communism
with Chairman Mayo.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.756
-(meows): Mao.
-You're right, you're right. Sorry, sorry.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.383
No, I mean she can really talk.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.843
She told me that she is using the family

11:58.927 --> 12:00.804
for some kind of cat plan.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.223
Brian, have you been
watching flat Earth videos?

12:03.306 --> 12:04.766
Those always make you mistrustful.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.184
I'm serious, Stewie.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.228
And there are actually
some flat Earth models

12:08.311 --> 12:09.729
that aren't completely idiotic.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.272
Look, I can't do this right now.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.149
We're pretty into our book
about Chairman Mayo.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.984
-(meows): Mao.
-(chuckles): Sorry, sorry.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.612
Get out of here, Brian,
you're messing me up.

12:20.699 --> 12:23.660
Meg, I need to talk to you about Pouncey.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.578
It is my duty as this family's dog

12:25.662 --> 12:27.414
to protect it when I sense danger.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.416
And I sense danger with Pouncey.

12:29.499 --> 12:31.292
Look, you may be our family dog,

12:31.376 --> 12:33.628
but you've never really been my dog.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.339
I'm a punching bag at school and at home.

12:36.423 --> 12:38.967
And there were some days where
I could have really used a dog

12:39.050 --> 12:40.051
to help cheer me up.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.511
And where were you?

12:41.594 --> 12:43.680
Hanging out with Dad or-or Chris or Stewie

12:43.763 --> 12:45.932
for your little time travel adventures.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.225
You know about the time machine?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.019
Yeah, my room's right next door.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.937
That thing's loud as (bleep).

12:51.021 --> 12:52.147
I have a new pet now.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.649
One that's there for me when I need her.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.109
Unlike you.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.694
Okay. I see.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.988
(microwave chimes)

13:00.071 --> 13:02.073
You have a microwave in your room?

13:02.157 --> 13:04.367
Yeah, I got tired of people groaning

13:04.451 --> 13:05.827
every time I went into the kitchen.

13:05.910 --> 13:08.955
Oh. You got, uh,
Redenbacher's up in there?

13:09.039 --> 13:10.415
-Yeah.
-Oh, word?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.751
Brian, stop trying to sound young.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.169
(chuckles)
Okay, Booger.

13:14.252 --> 13:16.504
-(scoffs) Boomer.
-Boomer.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.303
(purring)

13:23.386 --> 13:25.555
You make me so happy, Pouncey.

13:27.557 --> 13:31.519
This is gonna sound weird,
but do you want to dance?

13:40.737 --> 13:42.864

14:05.595 --> 14:08.348
Whoa, did this just get super hot?

14:16.022 --> 14:19.234
You're mine now, Meg.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.987
Ow.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.906
I like "ow."

14:25.990 --> 14:28.034
Hey.
Whoa, weird.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.537
Sorry to interrupt.
I'm just cleaning my cleats.

14:35.166 --> 14:38.169
(gasps)
Cats, kittens and cats.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.839
Cat lady.
Lots of plastic bags.

14:40.922 --> 14:43.258
Tissues in-in my sleeves.
Velcro sneakers.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.093
Funny dish towels.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.429
(gasps, panting)

14:47.512 --> 14:49.264
Good.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.517
Come, Meg.
It's time to go.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.982

15:12.328 --> 15:15.915

for the other day.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.584
Hello?

15:24.716 --> 15:26.718
What the hell does this say?

15:41.608 --> 15:45.278
-Oh, my God.
-QUAGMIRE: She left, didn't she?

15:45.362 --> 15:48.782
-Quagmire?
-I heard everything you were saying about Pouncey, Brian,

15:48.865 --> 15:50.575
and you were right to be concerned.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.119
I knew it.
Wait, how did you hear everything I said?

15:53.203 --> 15:56.706
I put a cat-cam in your house.
It was a repurposed shower-cam.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.541
It's standard cat adoption procedure.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.418
-Is it? Really?
-Yep. Yep.

16:00.502 --> 16:01.920
-The agency knew about it?
-Yep.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.672
-Because it seems weird that...
-Let it go, you prude.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.173
We're losing valuable time.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.676
Sometimes cats do have ulterior motives.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.469
Sometimes, when they find
the right person,

16:09.552 --> 16:11.262
they enslave them to do their bidding

16:11.346 --> 16:12.931
for the rest of their lives.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.101
Someone to take care
of all the feral cats in a neighborhood.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.435
A crazy cat lady?

16:17.519 --> 16:19.145
-That's right.
-How do they do that?

16:19.229 --> 16:21.356
Their poop.
Toxoplasmosis.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.233
It can make people act crazy.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.318
It's a real thing discovered by this guy.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.489
Oh, dear God.

16:29.572 --> 16:31.491
So what you're saying
is that everyone who likes cats

16:31.574 --> 16:32.909
only likes them because they literally

16:32.992 --> 16:34.619
have crap in their brain?

16:34.703 --> 16:36.496
-That's correct.
-And people who like dogs

16:36.579 --> 16:38.581
just like 'em
because they're chill as hell?

16:38.665 --> 16:41.292
-That's correct.
-Wow, what a bulletproof fact.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.877
There's still time to save Meg.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.338
There's a big house
on the loneliest block in Quahog.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.424
You can find her there.
But go quick.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.677

it's too late.
