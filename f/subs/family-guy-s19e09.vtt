ANNOUNCER:
We now return to The Today Show

00:37.078 --> 00:39.289
with Matt Lauer
sadly looking in the window.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.416
First up, Rachael Ray will be here

00:41.499 --> 00:43.877
to help us with a simple Christmas recipe.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.420
(muffled):
Can I come back now?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.213
Then, Al will be in to get you ready

00:47.297 --> 00:48.715
with your Christmas travel weather.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.592
Are you guys still sore at me?

00:50.675 --> 00:53.553
We also share your best tweets
about family visitors.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.014
I thought about what I did.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.600
(loud thud)

00:58.683 --> 01:00.685
(groans)

01:00.769 --> 01:03.563
(bleep) (grunts)

01:03.646 --> 01:07.359
(bleep) (grunts) (bleep)

01:07.442 --> 01:10.362
(Lois grunts, pants)

01:13.490 --> 01:15.116
(groans, pants)

01:15.200 --> 01:16.993
That looks heavy.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.871
Well, dragging a bin full
of decorations down the stairs

01:19.954 --> 01:21.623
while repeatedly yelling (bleep)

01:21.706 --> 01:24.209
in front of my children
means only one thing.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.003
It's Christmas time.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.963
Yeah, Lois, I knew
it was Christmas a week ago

01:29.047 --> 01:32.008
when the "O" in the PornHub
logo became a wreath.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.760
-Same.
-Nice.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.470
Listen, there's a lot of work to be done

01:35.553 --> 01:38.181
to make this place look festive,
and unlike most years,

01:38.264 --> 01:40.850
where I do everything,
this year I want you all

01:40.934 --> 01:42.519
to help with the Christmas chores.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.229
Come on, Lois.
You know the deal around here.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.065
We split everything zero-100,
like most couples.

01:47.148 --> 01:48.900
And I also have another request.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.610
I'd like to finally get a present

01:50.694 --> 01:52.529
from the heart this year.

01:52.612 --> 01:54.447
Not just some defective clothing item

01:54.531 --> 01:56.491
Peter got on clearance at Marshalls.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.785
But you love The Roling Stons.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.495
Now, to make sure
you don't forget your chores,

02:00.578 --> 02:02.205
I've made you each a list.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.833
And I want all of these
completed by tomorrow.

02:04.916 --> 02:07.794
Sorry. I can't do chores.
My trick elbow is acting up.

02:07.877 --> 02:10.505
-Is that your card?
-No.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.008
Oh, boy, it's worse than I thought.

02:19.014 --> 02:22.225
Why are we doing our Christmas
shopping at the strip mall?

02:22.308 --> 02:24.269
'Cause we ran out of gas out front.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.521
You got to get that gas gauge fixed.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.356
Look, Chris, did you want
the gas gauge fixed,

02:28.440 --> 02:29.774
or did you want a year of Quibi?

02:29.858 --> 02:31.860
The gas gauge.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.903
I'm sure we can find everything
on Mom's list here.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864
It doesn't look so bad.

02:35.947 --> 02:40.201
If this place doesn't have Baby
Yoda toys, I swear to God...

02:40.285 --> 02:43.038
I'll probably buy something
with Spider-Man on it.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.415
Okay, guys, now before
you can shop at a strip mall,

02:45.498 --> 02:47.417
you have to use the free-standing ATM

02:47.500 --> 02:49.085
that's chained to a pole

02:49.169 --> 02:51.379
and not affiliated with any known bank.

02:53.423 --> 02:56.384
Good.
It's taking an extra-long time

02:56.468 --> 02:58.553
to read the card and probably
stealing the number.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.390
Select "yes" to pay $15 fee. No brainer.

03:02.474 --> 03:03.933
Perfect.
Now I can't read the screen,

03:04.017 --> 03:05.643
'cause the glare is so bad.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.312
And it's not giving me my card back.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.356
-(phone ringing)
-Hello?

03:09.439 --> 03:11.066
Yes, this is Peter Griffin.

03:11.149 --> 03:13.360
Not anymore?
Well, thanks for telling me.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.071
Look, there's a card and nice paper store.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.866
Let's go walk around it slowly
and let out tiny farts.

03:19.949 --> 03:22.369
-(door bells tinkle)
-(soft instrumental music plays)

03:22.452 --> 03:24.996
Hmm. Nice, thick card stock.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.164
(squeaky gas expulsion)

03:26.247 --> 03:28.333
Ah, yes, that's a very bright white.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.335
(squeaky gas expulsion)

03:30.418 --> 03:31.961
Ooh, Century Gothic font.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.380
(loud, rumbling, gas expulsion)

03:33.463 --> 03:37.175
Miss, this store is for tiny farts only.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.303
There's a Lids next door
for that sort of thing.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.183
Welcome to the strip mall H&R Block.

03:45.266 --> 03:46.893
Yes, I'd like to do my taxes.

03:46.976 --> 03:49.646
-How much does H charge?
-$59.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.481
Hmm. How much does R charge?

03:51.564 --> 03:53.483
$59.

03:53.566 --> 03:57.445
Does R know H has a side thing
going with M? H&M?

03:57.529 --> 03:59.114
I don't know what you're talking about.

03:59.197 --> 04:00.990
Is H back from lunch yet?

04:01.074 --> 04:03.493
Sorry.
He said he was held up with a client.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.830
You were with M again, weren't you?!

04:06.913 --> 04:08.456
What? No, I wasn't.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.458
Then why are you wearing
a designer-looking shirt

04:10.542 --> 04:12.043
at a fraction of the cost?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.837
Maybe I wanted to get caught.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.715
I told you what I'd do
if I ever caught you cheating.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.675
This is on you!

04:19.968 --> 04:23.138
Why?! Why?!

04:23.221 --> 04:24.973
What's up?
I was just taking a pee.

04:25.056 --> 04:26.641
Someone call?

04:26.725 --> 04:29.811
Sometimes they let me write my own skits.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.983
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to CBS This Morning

04:35.066 --> 04:38.236
with Charlie Rose
sadly pressed against the window.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.572
Coming up this morning,
Christmas came early

04:40.655 --> 04:43.825
for a group of first graders
in South Bend, Indiana.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.411
(muffled):
You guys still cross with me?

04:46.494 --> 04:49.789
Hey, how was the big day of shop...

04:49.873 --> 04:52.584
(sighs)
Wait. Where's all the Christmas stuff?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.544
Ah, yeah. About that...

04:54.627 --> 04:56.087
I can't believe this.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.048
Brian, where's Stewie's Elf on the Shelf?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.884
Meg, where's the twinkling lights
I asked for?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.302
Peter, where's the Christmas tree?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.845
We don't even have a tree.

05:03.928 --> 05:05.722
I'm sorry, Lois.
I got it all under control.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.141
Don't you worry about a thing.
I'll be right back.

05:09.184 --> 05:12.437
♪ ♪

05:12.520 --> 05:14.981
(wind whistling)

05:15.065 --> 05:17.692
(gasps)
Peter, you did get a tree.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.736
Oh, it's beautiful.

05:19.819 --> 05:23.782
I sure did, Lois, because I love
you and I love this family.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.408
Oh, Peter.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.370
Peter. Peter.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.580
Peter. Peter?!

05:30.663 --> 05:33.124
Peter Griffin,
what the hell is going on here?

05:33.208 --> 05:35.293
Huh? Huh? What? Oh, yeah.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.504
I was gonna go get all
the Christmas stuff,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.339
but then I fell asleep rubbin' one out

05:39.422 --> 05:41.675
to Madonna's "Santa Baby" in the car.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.468
By the way, tonight's date night
is cancelled

05:43.551 --> 05:45.220
due to lack of interest.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.889
Peter, you were all supposed
to take the weight

05:47.972 --> 05:51.017
of the holidays off my shoulders
for once, and you failed.

05:51.101 --> 05:52.686
You all failed.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.646
Brian, you're supposed to be responsible.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.856
Bad dog. Bad.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.525
(whimpering)

05:58.608 --> 06:02.195
Damn it. And who got candy cane
all over the couch?

06:02.278 --> 06:04.030
(whimpering)

06:04.114 --> 06:05.740
You know what?
I've had it.

06:05.824 --> 06:08.827
Every year, my cousin asks me
to come to Cabo for Christmas.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.537
Well, this year, I'm going.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.163
You're all gonna see how hard it is

06:12.247 --> 06:14.165
to make Christmas happen
around here without me.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.419
I am packing my bags, and I'm out of here.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.087
You're getting divorced?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.714
No, I'm just leaving for a few days

06:20.797 --> 06:22.257
and ruining their Christmas.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.217
You're ruining Christmas

06:24.300 --> 06:26.803
by suing the city
over holiday decorations?

06:26.886 --> 06:29.305
No, I'm just leaving my family
for the holidays.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.683
You're doing deaf jokes?

06:31.766 --> 06:34.269
No. No one's doing deaf jokes.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.272
Well, I can't hear, so I don't know.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.232
She's not doing them.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.026
-What?
-I don't know.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.153
I think we... I think...

06:43.236 --> 06:46.072
I think we are doing deaf jokes
at this point.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.581
I can't believe Mom went to Cabo

06:54.664 --> 06:56.332
and left us alone for Christmas.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.084
What are we gonna do?

06:58.168 --> 06:59.961
Well, I'll tell you
the first thing we're gonna do.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.964
We're gonna delete all of her
pretentious crap off the DVR.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.550
I want to be the one to delete The Crown.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.511
She never watched them.
She just had 'em.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.888
Do it, son.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.057
Well, well, well, The Crown.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.600
How the tables have turned.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.268
Remember this face?

07:15.352 --> 07:17.145
The one that wanted
to watch Modern Family?

07:17.228 --> 07:19.939
Well, payback's a bitch.
Delete!

07:20.023 --> 07:23.360
"Are you sure you want
to delete The Crown?" Yes.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.738
"Do you understand
that it's really good?" Yes!

07:26.821 --> 07:30.575
"Are you sure?
It will impress your friends." Accept.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.203
"You understand that we change
the cast every season."

07:33.286 --> 07:35.121
Acknowledge.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.166
"Come on. It's The Crown. It's history."
Don't care.

07:38.249 --> 07:40.460
"You are not allowed to delete The Crown."

07:40.543 --> 07:42.462

BRITISH TV ANNOUNCER:
We now return to The Crown.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.138
(man mumbling in British accent)

07:52.222 --> 07:53.973
I actually kind of love it.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.725
Ah, me, too.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.520
It's 'cause I'm trash,
and I love how fancy it is.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.563
Dad, this doesn't help with Christmas.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.941
Yeah, we're screwed.
Who's gonna decorate?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.859
Who's gonna cook Christmas dinner?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.903
Okay, calm down.
Now, I know your mom's gone,

08:06.986 --> 08:09.739
and we're a little worried,
but Daddy's got a plan.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.617
All right, everybody,
go outside and kneel face-first

08:12.701 --> 08:14.994
in front of Daddy's big pre-dug hole.

08:15.078 --> 08:16.579
Come on, Peter.
We can do this.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.164
All right, Plan B.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.417
I take two pills I got after my root canal

08:20.500 --> 08:21.751
and listen to records.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.088
(smooth jazz playing)

08:25.171 --> 08:27.632
It's been four days.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.226
Huh. Not too bad.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.613
First of all,
these are really good binoculars.

08:50.697 --> 08:52.866
Second, this was a great plan.

08:52.949 --> 08:57.162
Watching the family fall apart
without me is better than Cabo.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.788
Ah. Look at them.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.623
I'll get a phone call any minute

09:00.707 --> 09:03.209
begging me to come back
and save Christmas.

09:03.293 --> 09:07.630
But in the meantime,
it's time for a little relaxation.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.632
MOTEL TV ANNOUNCER:
Welcome to the Quahog Motel,

09:09.716 --> 09:11.551
the winner of Tripadvisor's award for

09:11.634 --> 09:14.763
"Best In-Room Stationery
to Write Your Suicide Note On".

09:14.846 --> 09:17.057
Yeah, this is gonna work.

09:17.140 --> 09:21.436
Now all I have to do is lie here
and wait, like a cobra.

09:21.519 --> 09:24.356
-Cobra? Party of one?
-Yes, that's me.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.232
And would you like me to bring
your drink from the bar?

09:26.316 --> 09:29.152
Uh, yes. I have no hands?

09:33.656 --> 09:37.869
All right, time to put up
the 2020 Christmas decorations.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.705
First, ethnically-accurate Jesus
goes right here

09:40.789 --> 09:43.124
next to Father Mary and Mother Josephine,

09:43.208 --> 09:45.585
followed closely
by the three genderless Wise People

09:45.669 --> 09:47.045
on their Bird Scooters,

09:47.128 --> 09:48.546
Tig Notaro for some reason,

09:48.630 --> 09:50.590
and of course, the Little Drummer Them.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.259
Because God forbid we call a boy a boy.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.679
-Dad, what are you say...
-I don't like what the world is!

09:55.762 --> 09:57.931
I'm white!
When's it gonna be our turn?!

09:58.014 --> 09:59.641
Peter, relax.
