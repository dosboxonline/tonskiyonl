Thanks for bringing us
to your company picnic, peter.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.288
This is gonna be so much fun.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.665
Yeah, I figured it's
finally time you guys put faces

00:41.709 --> 00:44.084
To the people I've been bitching
about for the past eight years.

00:44.170 --> 00:46.378
Oop, there's charity 5k guy.

00:46.464 --> 00:49.089
Let's run lupus
out of town, huh, guys?

00:50.801 --> 00:52.342
I work with peter now.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.220
There's the guy who started
after me, and was beneath me,

00:55.264 --> 00:57.222
But now he's, like,
higher up than I am.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.725
-Hey, bob.
-Hey, darren.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.022
Thank you all for coming
to today's picnic.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.150
Now, for our main event:
The aerial ovum transfer,

01:08.235 --> 01:11.236
Or, as it's sometimes known,
the egg toss.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.322
This year, as a special prize,

01:13.407 --> 01:15.532
The winning team
will receive a five-night stay

01:15.659 --> 01:18.535
At my vacation home
in mooseattackee, maine.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.579
With miles of trails,
it is one of maine's

01:20.706 --> 01:22.539
Premiere hiking destinations.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.792
And you're only
a short bike ride away

01:24.877 --> 01:26.543
From its quaint downtown.

01:26.629 --> 01:31.048
Let your cares melt away as you
paddle across serene lake June.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.008
Peter, that place
in maine is amazing.

01:33.094 --> 01:34.843
It looks
like a stephen king book

01:34.970 --> 01:36.762
Before anything bad happens.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.098
Hi, gary, how's it going?
How's brenda?

01:39.225 --> 01:42.101
Oh, she's great.
Uh, just alive, super alive.

01:42.144 --> 01:44.603
-How are the boys?
-Yep, all alive.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.313
Children and pets all alive

01:46.440 --> 01:48.816
And acting
like normal children and pets.

01:48.901 --> 01:51.235
That's great.
H-hey, have you met

01:51.362 --> 01:53.362
That new stranger from not here?

01:53.447 --> 01:56.406
Nope.
See you tomorrow definitely.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.078
Peter,
we got to win this vacation,

02:01.247 --> 02:02.955
But there are
so many other teams.

02:03.082 --> 02:05.207
Relax, lois.
I brought a hard-boiled egg,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.459
So while all the other teams
are getting eliminated,

02:07.545 --> 02:09.670
We can just play
an "angry dad" game of catch.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.631
So the school called to say
they found pot in your locker.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.258
You want to tell me about that?

02:14.343 --> 02:17.177
Ow! I-I'm not sure
what we're doing, peter.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.513
So how's that summer job hunt
coming?

02:19.682 --> 02:22.558
I don't think they're hiring
in front of the tv all day.

02:22.685 --> 02:25.060
Ow! That's too hard.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.478
You know what else is hard?

02:26.605 --> 02:28.689
Waking up next to a woman
you no longer love.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.232
Try that on for size.

02:31.569 --> 02:34.027
[indistinct chatter]

02:34.113 --> 02:36.071
Peter, they've all
been eliminated.

02:36.157 --> 02:38.866
The game is over,
but I think we should talk.

02:38.951 --> 02:41.743
Yes! The griffins
are going to maine.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.704
And if that isn't
the perfect promo

02:43.873 --> 02:46.206
For the middle of a meaningless
vikings-packers game,

02:46.292 --> 02:47.708
I don't know what is.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.128
<i> Announcer: And the players</i>
<i> have gathered around clark.</i>

02:51.255 --> 02:54.506

<i> his injury wasn't too serious</i>

02:54.633 --> 02:58.218
<i> And we start to see some</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:01.305

03:14.236 --> 03:16.528
A family vacation in maine.

03:16.614 --> 03:19.907
My monogrammed canvas bag
is gonna be so excited.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.783
You said it, lois.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.077
I can't wait to get stuffed
with old sunscreens

03:24.163 --> 03:26.079
And emergency tampons.

03:26.165 --> 03:28.081
Yo, a pool table?

03:28.167 --> 03:30.959
Hell ya! I'm gonna be
gettin' all up in that.

03:31.086 --> 03:34.338
How does one get
"all up in" a pool table?

03:34.465 --> 03:36.465
And, wow, look,
it's bigger than I thought.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.883
So many bedrooms.

03:38.010 --> 03:38.926
Yeah, with all that extra space,

03:39.053 --> 03:40.219
We could invite
our friends along.

03:40.429 --> 03:42.971
Quagmire, joe and bonnie,
cleveland and his family.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.848
-The whole gang could come.
-Really?

03:44.934 --> 03:47.059
Do you think
everyone would enjoy it?

03:47.144 --> 03:48.977
Lois, do you know
what's up in maine?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.479
Art's trading post.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.189
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to go up there

03:52.274 --> 03:53.649
To see the trained bear show.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.901
They ride bikes,
they wear dracula fangs--

03:55.986 --> 03:57.653
Seasonally--
and then there's one part

03:57.780 --> 04:00.239
Where nipsy the brown bear
pretends to smoke a cigar.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.074
And I'm not even kidding.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.450
Ah, I don't know, peter.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.452
It's a lot of people
under one roof.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.663
Come on, lois,
this is our big chance

04:07.748 --> 04:09.581
To yell at kids who aren't ours.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.083
You know what? Let's do it.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.793
I think bonnie's gained
five pounds,

04:12.962 --> 04:14.419
And I want to see her
in a swimsuit.

04:14.505 --> 04:17.214
While we're on the subject
of mrs. Swanson and swimsuits,

04:17.299 --> 04:19.549
Question:
If mrs. Swanson goes swimming,

04:19.635 --> 04:21.802
Then hangs her bathing suit
to dry in the bathroom,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.054
Am I allowed to wring
the water into a cup?

04:24.139 --> 04:25.764
-And do what with it?
-Irrelevant.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.975
Do not concern yourself
with what happens to the water

04:28.060 --> 04:30.769
Once it's in the cup.
Am I allowed?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.854
Uh, I'm gonna say no.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.649
All right, well, the guy
from reddit already paid

04:35.734 --> 04:37.567
For the water, but I'll--

04:37.695 --> 04:39.695
I'll figure something out.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.627
I've been waiting a long time
for this trip, brian.

04:55.713 --> 04:57.212
To come to maine? Huh.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.922
I didn't think you were much
of an outdoorsman.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.632
[scoffs] the outdoors
can get stuffed.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.175
We're near kennebunkport,

05:02.303 --> 05:04.052
Home of the bush family compound

05:04.179 --> 05:06.054
And,
according to<i> dowdy</i> magazine,

05:06.140 --> 05:08.181
The very place
where barbara bush picked

05:08.267 --> 05:10.017
That one haircut 40 years ago

05:10.102 --> 05:12.060
And never looked back. See?

05:12.104 --> 05:14.438
The perfect, coiffed, lady fro.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.815
I hear tell that she brought
a quaker oats box

05:16.859 --> 05:19.067
Into the salon and said, "this."

05:19.153 --> 05:21.778
Uh-oh, no pavement,
lot of rocks and roots.

05:21.864 --> 05:24.114
Good thing joe brought his

05:24.241 --> 05:26.074
New off-road tires!

05:26.201 --> 05:28.118
I didn't pack the tires.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.162
Oh.

05:30.289 --> 05:31.830
Nuts.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.665
All right, gang,
time to head inside.

05:33.751 --> 05:35.000
Now one quick heads-up.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.127
Every room has a lake view
except one.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.337
Somebody's gonna have
to look out

05:38.464 --> 05:40.839
Over that girls' volleyball camp
next door.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.717
Nice serve, stacy.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.474
What did I tell ya, lois?

05:50.559 --> 05:52.392
Look at
all those big smiles and--

05:52.519 --> 05:56.063
Cleveland jr., no wet feet
on the hardwood floor!

05:56.190 --> 05:58.023
This is gonna be a great week.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.941
Hey, peter,
will you call your boss?

06:00.069 --> 06:02.194
For what? I don't want
to bug him already.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.196
He wrote the wi-fi password
in a font

06:04.281 --> 06:07.407
Where the big letter I's and the
l juniors are the same thing.

06:07.493 --> 06:09.534
I can't make
heads or tails of it.

06:09.620 --> 06:12.079
Are you calling preston?
Ask him about the towel sitch.

06:12.164 --> 06:14.331
I could only find three
and you're gonna need those

06:14.458 --> 06:16.416
To clean the soda off
the pool table.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.877
We already spilled
on the pool table?

06:18.962 --> 06:21.463
Yeah, meg was really
gettin' all up in it.

06:21.548 --> 06:24.257
Hey, peter? Uh, someone
either laid a giant turd

06:24.343 --> 06:26.676
Or tried to flush
a russet potato down the toilet.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.387
It's totally clogged.

06:30.933 --> 06:34.393
<i> Announcer:</i>
<i> And clark, still unresponsive,</i>

06:34.520 --> 06:39.064
<i> Being carted off the field</i>

06:39.149 --> 06:44.027
<i> This week's</i> family guy:
<i> Someone lays a giant turd.</i>

06:49.660 --> 06:53.036
It's the single largest
defecate I ever saw.

06:53.122 --> 06:55.789
Should we try flushing it
again as a show of force?

06:55.958 --> 06:58.458
Nah, chris,
that'll only make it angry.

06:58.627 --> 07:01.044
Okay, here's the situation:
A stubborn bm

07:01.130 --> 07:02.838
Is blocking up our main toilet.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.965
I can't find a plunger,
so whoever did it

07:05.050 --> 07:06.842
Needs to get in there
with a dishwashing glove

07:06.927 --> 07:08.969
And punch it through.
So who was it?

07:11.056 --> 07:14.224
Say, chris, that looks like a
fresh rim of sweat on your hat.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.476
Wouldn't happen to be
"pushing sweat," would it?

07:16.603 --> 07:19.312
What? No!
I was reading a chapter book.

07:19.398 --> 07:21.565
Meg, you're generally gross.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.233
Anything you want to fess up to?

07:23.318 --> 07:26.144
Nope. I'm "dogging it"
this month for the environment.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.071
That means I only go outside.

07:28.157 --> 07:29.364
Saves water, feeds the soil,

07:29.408 --> 07:31.658
Turns a few heads
at the same time.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.368
Okay, this is disgusting.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.078
D-does it really matter
who did it?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.830
I'd kind of like to know.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.874
Yeah, we should
at least make sure

07:38.959 --> 07:40.459
They don't need
medical attention.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.586
Well, I'd like to get on
with my vacation.

07:42.713 --> 07:44.796
There's got to be a plunger
around here somewhere.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.298
Peter, come on, help me look.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.800
Okay, listen up,
we don't have much time.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.886
It was me, peter.
I clogged the toilet.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.472
That was you?
How is that even possible?

07:53.599 --> 07:56.057
[groans] it was all
that fiber-y mom cereal

07:56.143 --> 07:57.476
<i> The view</i> told us to eat.

07:57.603 --> 08:00.353
That turd has joy behar's
fingerprints all over it.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.014
But I need you
to take the fall for me.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.649
Uh, I don't know, lois.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.526
Even for a husky guy like me,

08:06.612 --> 08:07.903
It's shamefully large.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.238
I know!
That's why I need your help.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.324
That is not a poop
a woman can come back from.

08:12.409 --> 08:14.242
Look, you take the blame,
and I'll let you

08:14.286 --> 08:16.411
Get two souvenirs
at the bear show.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.914
It's not gonna be, like,
like, like, books, is it?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.207
No.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.083
All right, everybody, listen up.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.127
I'm the one
who clogged the toilet.

08:24.171 --> 08:26.046
[all clamoring in disgust]

08:26.131 --> 08:28.632
Oh, great! As if that
little slug of yours

08:28.717 --> 08:30.050
Isn't embarrassing enough.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.219
Sorry, I have
to make this believable.

-So it's big?
-Let's...

Hey, why's some of this stuff
highlighted in green,

09:04.294 --> 09:06.044
But my bear show is in yellow?

09:06.129 --> 09:07.796
Because the bear show
is priority yellow.

[laughing] a bear, a bear show
would never be priority green.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.468
All right, as long
as it's on there, I guess.

I never wear at home,

Well, I guess it's time to
face the music.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.760
What are you guys doing here?

18:15.887 --> 18:17.637
We came back to help you, peter.

Did you say "not just us"

18:28.316 --> 18:29.690
Before we pulled over
the horizon?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.142
Yeah, it was perfect.

18:31.194 --> 18:32.777
Yes. That is why we practiced

18:32.862 --> 18:34.070
In the walmart parking lot.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.155
But I was
such a jerk to all of you.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.323
Why would you help me now?

Lois says you were the one
pushing to

Called us your best friends.

made a better effort to

Get to your bear show,
instead of making the trip

18:46.251 --> 18:47.458
All about what we wanted to do.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.460
Yeah, and we left without
any of our chargers.

If it was just the blocks,
you know, big whoop-dee-doo,

18:52.257 --> 18:53.923
But it was the wires, too.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.424

Can we help you
fix the cabin, peter?

Some ancient pine trees

19:02.392 --> 19:04.809
To save this millionaire's

I'm sorry for what I said.

Only true friends would come
back to help the way you did,

And that's all that matters.

True friends will also stay

But you got to know this was
completely my fault.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.971
My friends and family
were the perfect guests,

19:42.056 --> 19:43.139

nothing to do with it.

But we still got
three days in the prize week.
