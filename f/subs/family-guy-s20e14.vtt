All right, thank you very much.

00:35.702 --> 00:36.870
Guys, great news.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.038
My uncle just died,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.956
so we can use
his HBO Max password

00:40.040 --> 00:41.916
until they cancel
his credit card.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.128
HBO? Is that the one with
<i>The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel?</i>

00:45.128 --> 00:47.005
No, you watch
<i>Marvelous Mrs. Maisel</i>

00:47.005 --> 00:49.382
where you also go
to buy sweatpants and cat food.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.925
Let's start
with <i>Game of Thrones,</i>

00:51.009 --> 00:53.636
which aired eight seasons
and was beloved by America

00:53.720 --> 00:56.389
for six-and-a-half seasons.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.649
Sorry, Lady Lotsaclothes,
it's not happening.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.901
I shouldn't have had
that entire elk for lunch.

01:49.901 --> 01:52.278
That's okay, Jon Yellowsnow.

01:52.362 --> 01:53.905
You know, this has been
happening a lot

01:53.905 --> 01:55.573
after your week in Mykonos.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.076
Should I try using
the Timothée Chalamet mask?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.369
Could be worth a shot.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.126
It's a raven from
my twin sister, Queen Hearsay.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.879
She says her friend told her
that the king is dead.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.089
That's hearsay.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.926
Oh, this one just says,
"Girl, you trippin'."

02:15.010 --> 02:16.428
That's so raven.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.224
It's time.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.642
I must go to King's Landing

02:22.726 --> 02:25.145
to stake my claim
as the true and rightful heir

02:25.145 --> 02:26.354
to the iron throne.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.523
Be careful, Jon Yellowsnow.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.067
I will be handsome,
and that will be enough.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.950
Ah, Joe the Broken.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.410
I haven't seen you
in a fortnight.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.162
Yeah, I've been playing
<i>Overwatch</i> lately.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.788
- Where you headed?
- I'm going to King's Landing

02:43.872 --> 02:46.082
- to take the iron throne.
- No way.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.501
You're a pretty rad dude,
Jon Yellowsnow.

02:48.585 --> 02:50.962
Yeah, I'm a white guy with
a Jheri curl, so I have to be.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.298
- Mind if I come with?
- Why should I bring you?

02:53.298 --> 02:56.092
Because I can warg.
Check it.

03:00.221 --> 03:01.931
Ooh, that felt so good.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.224
I have this cool power,

03:03.308 --> 03:05.602
but I'm not positive
how to use it yet.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.440
Now that King Dad's dead,

03:10.440 --> 03:12.275
I want to sit
on the iron throne.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.277
Now, don't be too hasty, Joffrey,

03:14.361 --> 03:15.653
you're fourth in line

03:15.737 --> 03:18.656
behind your brothers
Jumpen, Fallum and Splat.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.866
- Aah!
- Jumpen!

03:19.866 --> 03:20.950
- Aah!
- Fallum!

03:21.034 --> 03:22.452
- Aah!
- Splat!

03:23.286 --> 03:24.871
As you are the new king,

03:24.871 --> 03:27.248
I will be whispering
far too close to your ear,

03:27.332 --> 03:30.085
and you should know that I have
a special brooch that I wear.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.087
That's my character.
So, if you need a brooch,

03:32.087 --> 03:34.047
I'll, uh, I'll be here.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.215
Thanks, Lottafinger.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.966
Always good to have
a brooch guy.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.802
Hey, whose leg
do you have to hump

03:38.802 --> 03:40.720
to get a Dornish wine
around here?

03:40.804 --> 03:42.514
What's Uncle Doggian doing here?

03:42.514 --> 03:44.391
- I don't like him.
- Neither do I,

03:44.391 --> 03:46.559
but he is the paw of the king.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.269
He's smart,
so we need him.

03:49.688 --> 03:52.524
I have two skills:
I drink and I know things.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.442
Oh, word?
What things do you know?

03:54.526 --> 03:56.444
- Like, so many things.
- What's one?

03:56.528 --> 03:57.987
War. Tons about war.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.781
- What about it?
- It's bad.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.449
Like, really, super bad.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.118
- Is that all you know?
- No.

04:03.118 --> 04:06.037
Front lines, flanking...

04:06.121 --> 04:07.831
- planking...
- That's yoga.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.667
Uh, I think it's both, but we
can broach that subject later.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.127
Hmm? Somebody say brooch?

04:12.127 --> 04:13.795
- No, man.
- Oh, no worries.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.597
All hail His Grace,
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon

04:24.681 --> 04:26.599
and Lannister,
First of His Name,

04:26.683 --> 04:29.894
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and High Score on Mario Kart.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.564
I am Jon Yellowsnow,

04:32.564 --> 04:35.316
the one true king
and rightful heir to the throne.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.819
Who's this guy?

04:37.819 --> 04:40.196
I'm Joe The Broken.
I can warg.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.574
No way, I love wargers.
Show me.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.826
I would, I just...

04:44.826 --> 04:47.662
I don't really
have to go potty right now.

04:50.582 --> 04:54.794
I am Daenerys Targaryen,
Mother of Dragons.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.173
Is there a problem here?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.508
Uh, no, no.
No, uh, n-no problem, really.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.595
I-I just didn't know
the Seven Kingdoms had any, um,

05:03.595 --> 05:07.098
strong, beautiful...
persons of color?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.475
Did I-did I get that right?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.602
Well, we out here, literal baby.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.228
Yeah. Right on. Good.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.396
Man, you know,
you should've heard me

05:13.480 --> 05:14.856
the other day,
- I was-
- I was like--

05:14.856 --> 05:16.483
I was alone, by the way,
nobody heard me--

05:16.483 --> 05:19.110
I was like, "When are the suits
gonna make persons of color

05:19.194 --> 05:21.654
a part of the show,
a small part of the show?"

05:21.738 --> 05:23.948
Joffrey, we have
bigger problems than that.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.533
The white walkers
are on their way.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.911
What? How do we know
you're telling the truth?

05:27.911 --> 05:31.373
Because they sent
a very white walker ahead.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.042
Excuse me,
do you know if Costco has

05:34.042 --> 05:36.795
any of those Tommy Bahama
beach chairs left?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.690
The battle's tonight, right?
I wasn't being pranked?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.233
The white walkers
are approaching!

05:58.233 --> 05:59.776
Battle stations!

05:59.776 --> 06:02.696
Prepare for the most epic battle
of all time

06:02.696 --> 06:04.739
that nobody will see
because it's too dark,

06:04.823 --> 06:07.325
and we'll say it's
because they have bad TVs.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.081
Everyone! Fire!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.835
What happened?
He's dead.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.294
He's alive!

06:18.378 --> 06:20.005
He's dead again.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.923
All sorts of, trust me,

06:22.007 --> 06:24.259
very expensive
and groundbreaking effects.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.094
Oh, my God.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.512
Hey, hey, hey. Stop. Stop.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.930
That's us. That's us.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.016
Stop, man.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.063
They're giving up and running away.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.566
Well, the important thing
is we all survived

06:39.566 --> 06:42.318
and won the battle against
the people that can't die.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.786
Don't worry, guys,
I'm gonna be a great king.

06:51.870 --> 06:52.954
What are you gonna do
that's so great?

06:53.038 --> 06:55.498
I will make it illegal to say,

06:55.582 --> 06:57.792
"My trainer kicked my butt
this morning."

06:57.876 --> 06:59.419
That's pretty good.
Anything else?

06:59.419 --> 07:02.672
I decree that you may post
your wedding photos once.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.841
That's it.
Everyone has anniversaries.

07:04.841 --> 07:06.593
That's for you. It's private.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.303
Also, <i>Fleabag</i> was fine.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.014
Oh, I loved <i>Fleabag.</i>

07:11.014 --> 07:12.307
It was fine.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.061
<i>Well, that's the story
of</i> Game of Thrones,

07:16.061 --> 07:18.021
<i>and you can watch it on HBO Max.</i>

07:18.021 --> 07:19.397
<i>And, hey,
while I got you here,</i>

07:19.481 --> 07:22.108
<i>why aren't the</i> Real Sex
<i>episodes on HBO Max?</i>

07:22.192 --> 07:23.651
<i>It's part of the catalogue.</i>

07:23.735 --> 07:26.196
<i>Dance with the pervert shut-in
who brung ya.</i>

07:26.196 --> 07:29.240
Flat white for "Hold the Door"?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.241
Hodor? That's me.

07:36.081 --> 07:37.582
That was fun, huh?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.501
Yeah, I love shows

07:39.501 --> 07:41.920
where white people argue about
who's in charge.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.171
Then you're in luck.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.382
The next show is
called <i>Succession.</i>

07:45.382 --> 07:48.677
This show is so popular
that almost 6,000 people

07:48.677 --> 07:50.428
in New York and Los Angeles
have seen it.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.598
- Surely you're joking, I mean...
- I'm joking, yes, but not by a ton.

08:34.931 --> 08:37.851
As you all know, I am
the most powerful man in media.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.854
But, like Bryan Cox, I can't
find a sport coat that fits.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.357
What up, dicks?

08:44.441 --> 08:46.526
I cuss and I sit weird
in chairs.

08:46.526 --> 08:50.071
Now, I'm getting on in years
here at P-Stream Industries,

08:50.155 --> 08:53.366
and it is time
I choose my succession.

08:53.450 --> 08:55.952
But I feel great, and I probably
got 30 years left in me.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.455
But it's time for me to step
away and give it to one of you.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.498
None of you are getting
this company!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.667
But I need it to be one of you.

09:02.751 --> 09:06.755
I'm ready to step up and pee
on carpets if you need me, Dad.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.798
Oh, you think
you're ready, big shot?

09:08.882 --> 09:10.967
Have you even seen
<i>Boss Baby</i> once?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.595
- You said it was scary.
- Only one part.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.931
Okay, I will see everyone
at my birthday party tomorrow.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.558
And remember, I need you all

09:18.558 --> 09:19.893
to start fighting
over the company,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.394
but I will be here
for a long time.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.521
Man, I love this dad
that we all hate.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.903
Hello, Christopher.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.238
I'm just gonna sit over here

09:32.322 --> 09:35.909
while you quietly wonder which
country I'm supposed to be from.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.911
Happy birthday, Dad.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.996
- Yeah!
- Happy birthday, Pops.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.706
Oh, I don't
care about birthdays.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.249
We brought gifts.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.501
Yay, birthdays!

09:44.501 --> 09:47.587
I'll remind you I still haven't
decided who gets the company,

09:47.671 --> 09:49.506
but that my decision
will not be made

09:49.506 --> 09:51.257
based on who gives me
the best gift.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.511
- He-
- Man! You get the company.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.180
Wait, open mine, Dad.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.516
A Nintendo Switch.
You get the company.

09:59.516 --> 10:02.852
Wait, Dad, there's one more.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.272
- What the hell is this?
- I-I just figured,

10:06.356 --> 10:08.066
you love helicopters so much,

10:08.066 --> 10:09.609
maybe you could pretend
you were one?

10:09.693 --> 10:11.903
No. Clothes is boring.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.864
This birthday stinks.
Nobody gets the company.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.328
Um, I accidentally
took another carpet whiz,

10:20.412 --> 10:22.622
so Lois says I have to
give one of you the company.

10:22.706 --> 10:25.917
I'll hear presentations at
the corporate retreat next week.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.732
Everyone, put rocks
on your napkins.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.483
There are no more rocks.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.318
Okay, guys, guys,
rocks are not, like,

10:52.402 --> 10:53.778
a magic thing, all right?

10:53.862 --> 10:55.655
It's anything heavy,
is what the idea is.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.575
Now, welcome, successions.

10:58.575 --> 11:00.952
I'm about to die,
and I'm sharp as ever.

11:01.036 --> 11:02.203
Let's start the presentations.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.288
Brian and Stewie?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.710
P-Stream Industries.
What does it mean?

11:08.710 --> 11:10.587
Well, perhaps
we need to go back.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.590
All the way bac...
No. Just songs.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.886
Hey, Bri?

11:17.886 --> 11:20.388
I was just thinking back
to our London trip.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.974
Did things there seem
a bit... odd?

11:23.058 --> 11:25.685
<i>♪ Oh, in London Town,
the tube is the telly</i> ♪

11:25.769 --> 11:28.146
<i>♪ Where the gin is dry

11:28.146 --> 11:29.481
<i>What they call jam ♪</i>

11:29.481 --> 11:31.816
- <i>We call jelly in Lond... ♪</i>
- No.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.485
I hate this. Stop!

11:33.485 --> 11:35.320
All songs must be country duets.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.447
Chris and Meg, you're up.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.997
<i>P-Stream Industries ♪</i>

11:46.081 --> 11:48.500

11:52.087 --> 11:53.963
Stop!

11:54.047 --> 11:56.466
After watching how bad
you guys are at singing songs,

11:56.466 --> 11:59.010
I've decided I'm staying
at P-Stream Industries.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.390
Look, a lot of people
say P-Stream is weak,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.558
but the truth is
P-Stream has never been

12:05.642 --> 12:06.976
stronger or more vital.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.020
When I chose
to bifurcate P-Stream

12:09.104 --> 12:10.563
people said it was
gonna be a mess.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.525
And sure, there's been times
when P-Stream's been in the red.

12:13.525 --> 12:17.320
It hurt, but this isn't the time
for P-Stream to be yellow.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.030
It's clear now.
I am staying.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.699
Was that just so...

12:20.699 --> 12:22.701
Yeah, it was just about pee,
but I'm staying.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.577
And I'm running the company
with Big Bird,

12:24.661 --> 12:25.704
since he's at HBO now.

12:25.704 --> 12:28.123
I'm actually
Gwendoline Christie.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.583
I play Brienne
on <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

12:30.667 --> 12:32.794
I fear I may be a bit late.

12:32.794 --> 12:33.670
You get the company.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.886
Peter, pick a better show.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.096
I was barely in that.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.223
What HBO show do you want to do?

12:45.223 --> 12:47.475
Easy. <i>Big Little Lies.</i>

12:47.559 --> 12:49.227
Isn't that a show
about five women?

12:49.227 --> 12:52.647
Oh, I suppose it would be better
if it were about five men?

12:52.731 --> 12:54.482
Now that's interesting.

13:40.862 --> 13:42.864
How bad is it?

13:42.864 --> 13:44.616
Real bad.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.702
Now, why would a person poop

13:47.786 --> 13:50.121
at the bottom
of a school staircase?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.916
And why are all the men
dressed like Audrey Hepburn

13:52.916 --> 13:54.876
and the women like Elvis?

13:54.876 --> 13:57.128
It was
Peter Griffin's idea, sir.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.715
For some reason, Peter always
wants to dress like a woman.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.217
Just as a joke.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.177
Yeah, I sniffed the poop.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.804
I didn't roll in it.
I wanted to.

14:05.804 --> 14:08.556
Personally, I think it
all started with that incident

14:08.640 --> 14:11.309
with the Monterey five
on orientation day.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.816
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.901
I wear it because I'm poor.

14:19.901 --> 14:22.278
That's charming.
I really like you.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.863
Even though I'm poor?

14:23.947 --> 14:26.741
Hon, I like you
<i>because</i> you're poor.

14:26.825 --> 14:30.370
Chris and Peter became
a little team after that.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.665
I even saw them holding hands
once under the pier.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.500
Yeah, as a joke.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.545
This is my new
poor friend, Chris.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.006
I'm Joe. I sometimes have
soft-focus shower sex

14:41.006 --> 14:42.257
with my abusive wife.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.383
I'm Quagmire.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.968
I'm rich,
so I named my daughter

14:44.968 --> 14:47.595
after a recently
gentrified city: Boise.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.847
What's your kid's name?

14:48.847 --> 14:50.682
Jacksonville.

14:50.682 --> 14:51.683
That's bad.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.812
- Daddy!
- Hey, buddy.

14:57.147 --> 14:59.274
Eyes and ears, please.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.359
Somebody bullied
little Boise today.

15:01.443 --> 15:04.446
They said her dad
had the cheapest Tesla.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.405
The one you can't
drive very far.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.949
I was an early adopter.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.160
Boise, point to the kid
who said that.

15:18.460 --> 15:21.588
- Jacksonville, did you say it?
- No.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.965
He's lying!
He needs to apologize.

15:24.049 --> 15:25.717
He didn't do anything.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.969
This isn't over.
Come on, Boise.

15:28.053 --> 15:31.056
Let's go get $20-rhubarb
nonsense ice cream.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.314
Just an FYI, I say a lot
with my hand over my heart

15:39.314 --> 15:41.441
so you know I'm being sincere.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.068
We love that you're here.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.819
We love being here.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.571
I've never had coffee
by the water before.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.782
Since you're not from here,

15:48.782 --> 15:50.617
can I ask if you've been
to a Burger King

15:50.617 --> 15:52.744
and if it's true
they'll give anyone a crown?

15:52.744 --> 15:54.120
I've definitely been in them,

15:54.204 --> 15:56.915
but I'm not positive
about the crown thing.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.755
Be careful in Monterey.

16:03.755 --> 16:06.132
It's not just outdoor
fireplace wine shops

16:06.216 --> 16:09.135
and the opening credits bridge
that's actually in Big Sur.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.512
People talk
behind your back here.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.013
But you don't?

16:12.097 --> 16:13.765
No, I don't play those games.

16:13.765 --> 16:17.185
Hey, I'll be right back.
I'm gonna grab another napkin.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.939
Boy, that guy Chris
kind of sucks, eh?

16:22.399 --> 16:25.193
I want you and Jacksonville to
come to Stewie's birthday party

16:25.193 --> 16:27.153
at my all-glass house
this weekend.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.365
Thank you, Peter.
That sounds so civil.

16:33.785 --> 16:36.413
Back to the BK thing--
a Whopper Jr. isn't, like,

16:36.413 --> 16:38.415
younger than a Whopper, right,
it's just a name?

16:38.415 --> 16:40.542
Yeah, it's just
a smaller version.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.127
Yeah, that's what
Wikipedia said.

16:42.127 --> 16:43.628
I don't know why
you'd move from a place

16:43.712 --> 16:44.879
that has a Burger King.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.340
I can't really say why I moved.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.675
Why did you move?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.593
I can't really say.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.682
Sorry. I swims around here
because sometimes

16:55.682 --> 16:58.935
the ladies don't finish
their briocheses.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.603
You should take an
intense-face run

17:00.687 --> 17:02.147
at Backstory Beach.

17:28.423 --> 17:31.176
Hey, cuties.
Jacksonville, if you'd like,

17:31.176 --> 17:32.469
the kids are in Stewie's room

17:32.469 --> 17:35.180
hitting the nanny
with piñata sticks.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.265
Wow, what a great house.

17:37.349 --> 17:39.893
Thanks.
It used to be an Apple Store.

17:39.893 --> 17:41.936
I probably shouldn't
keep the glass so clean

17:42.020 --> 17:42.937
during migration season.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.647
Where do you guys live?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.733
We live under a lifeguard tower.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.235
I love how poor you are.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.528
What's Chris doing here?
His kid's a bully.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.490
Just tell us the deal
with Taco Bells, then leave.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.867
Specifically, I'd like to know
if there are actually bells,

17:55.867 --> 17:58.745
- or if it's just tacos.
- Just tacos.

17:59.829 --> 18:02.082
I also think Chris should leave,
but wonder if he'd tell me

18:02.082 --> 18:03.833
if I'm saying this right:

18:03.917 --> 18:05.210
Sbarro.

18:05.210 --> 18:07.921
Like that? The "s" and "b"
really go together?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.048
Cleveland, you agree
with me, right?

18:10.048 --> 18:11.716
Well, my wife and I do yoga,

18:11.800 --> 18:13.385
so I don't have to pick a side.

18:13.385 --> 18:16.304
Fine. We're leaving in a huff.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.099
- Cleveland, you leaving.
- Na-ima-stay.

18:20.850 --> 18:23.353
Hey, so can I meet your wife?

18:23.353 --> 18:24.729
No, she's playing
with her trains.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.606
There's tension
in our relationship,

18:26.690 --> 18:27.816
but I can't say why.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.526
- Why?
- I can't say.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.071
I can't believe
we're doing <i>Big Little Lies,</i>

18:33.071 --> 18:34.864
and I'm the train guy.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.128
So it's decided.
We ask Chris

18:48.128 --> 18:50.005
about the Wendy's Frosty,
and if it's a milkshake

18:50.005 --> 18:52.882
or ice cream, then we make him
and his bully son move.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.885
Hey, you guys smell that?

18:55.969 --> 18:58.346
Smells like poop.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.890
Oh, my God!
Somebody pooped

19:00.974 --> 19:01.891
at the bottom of the stairs!

19:03.935 --> 19:05.186
It was Chris.

19:05.270 --> 19:08.481
What? N-No.
There is poop down there,

19:08.565 --> 19:09.607
but I would never do that.

19:09.691 --> 19:11.151
Oh, this settles it.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.193
You and your son are psychos,

19:12.277 --> 19:13.194
and you need to move.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.864
It wasn't me!

19:15.864 --> 19:16.906
He's telling the truth.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.116
It's my poop.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.119
Peter, why would you poop

19:21.119 --> 19:22.662
at the bottom of the stairs?

19:22.746 --> 19:24.456
I didn't. I pooped in the
middle of the stairs, and it

19:24.456 --> 19:27.375
slinky'd down to the bottom.
It was very crazy to watch.

19:27.459 --> 19:29.085
- Did you film it?
- I should have filmed it, yeah.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.128
Why'd you do it, Peter?

19:31.755 --> 19:34.049
I eat all fiber
and I can't poop at home

19:34.049 --> 19:37.052
because my bathroom is all glass
and faces the ocean.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.721
The boats and fishes
look at me.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.139
Why don't you get
a street-facing bathroom?

19:41.139 --> 19:43.308
Lois says it messes up
the aesthetic of the house.

19:43.308 --> 19:45.352
That's why there's
tension in our marriage

19:45.352 --> 19:47.312
and why Lois spends
all her time with the trains.

19:47.312 --> 19:50.190
You're not alone
in this, sweetie.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.025
Lois is such a monster!

19:52.025 --> 19:55.070
Fellas, did one of you poop
at the bottom of the stairs?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.245
We all did.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.663
In the middle,
and it slinky'd down.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.041
- Did you happen to film that?
- I should have filmed it.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.877
<i>That was the beginning
of Peter's Law.</i>

20:10.877 --> 20:13.004
<i>Because of the Monterey five,</i>

20:13.088 --> 20:15.256
<i>from that day forward,
Peter's Law stipulated</i>

20:15.340 --> 20:17.926
<i>that every Monterey residence
is required to have</i>

20:17.926 --> 20:21.388
<i>at least one "away from
the ocean" facing toilet.</i>

20:24.182 --> 20:24.808
This is better.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.274
Well, I, for one,
am happy to be back

20:33.358 --> 20:35.026
to regular, old <i>Family Guy.</i>

20:35.110 --> 20:37.570
All-women show
and I'm playing with trains.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.406
Yep, it was fun
playing dress-up,

20:39.406 --> 20:40.657
but I think we can all agree

20:40.657 --> 20:42.367
that for Sunday night entertainment,

20:42.367 --> 20:44.536
Fox is the place to be.

20:45.954 --> 20:49.040
Do you know those three shows
we spent the night belittling

20:49.124 --> 20:51.042
have 114 Emmys

20:51.126 --> 20:52.877
to our zero?
