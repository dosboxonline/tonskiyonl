Boy, everybody's here.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.288
Why do you think
we're gathering?

00:39.415 --> 00:41.874
This isn't about the soiled
pants in the toilet, right?

00:41.959 --> 00:43.125
'cause I hadn't heard
about that.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.710
Good morning, employees.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.712
As some of you can tell
by my face,

00:46.797 --> 00:48.130
I have some exciting news.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.841
But first, a pair of husky-size
green pants were found

00:50.926 --> 00:53.302
In the men's room,
positively destroyed.

00:53.429 --> 00:55.012
(whispers): That's what
I hadn't heard about.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.680
Now the exciting news.

00:56.766 --> 00:59.016
The brewery is transitioning
to an open floor plan

00:59.101 --> 01:01.727
And will be called
the pawtucket patriot campus.

01:01.812 --> 01:04.563
To help explain the transition
to our futuristic workplace,

01:04.690 --> 01:06.607
I'd like to share a video
from our investor,

01:06.692 --> 01:09.818
The confusingly charismatic
wework lunatic.

01:09.945 --> 01:12.112
<i> Hey, I'm the guy from wework.</i>

01:12.239 --> 01:14.073
<i> My foremost goal is</i>
<i> to facilitate</i>

01:14.200 --> 01:16.742
<i> An experiential bandwidth</i>
<i> of synergy.</i>

01:16.827 --> 01:18.827
<i> Hammock desks,</i>
<i> scooter desks,</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:21.121
<i>And the world's first desk-desk.</i>

01:21.290 --> 01:24.124
<i> The only desk that</i>
<i> functions as a working desk.</i>

01:24.210 --> 01:27.169
<i>I have been the wework lunatic,</i>
<i> please don't google me.</i>

01:27.254 --> 01:29.505
Our new office will also have

01:29.590 --> 01:31.507
A lady chef
who only makes vegan food,

01:31.592 --> 01:34.009
Pinball machines,
and nursing pods.

01:34.095 --> 01:37.012
Lastly, as we transition
to our new open floor plan,

01:37.098 --> 01:38.388
The brewery will be closed

01:38.516 --> 01:40.140
For the next two months
for construction.

01:40.184 --> 01:41.266
Yes, griffin?

01:41.393 --> 01:45.270
Are the nursing pods,
l-like, for anyone?

01:49.193 --> 01:51.110
If I ordered
a whole cornish game hen,

01:51.195 --> 01:52.236
Would anyone have any?

01:52.321 --> 01:54.154
I'm in for a wing.
What's the occasion?

01:54.281 --> 01:56.115
I just found out
the brewery's closing

01:56.200 --> 01:57.783
So they can turn it into
the kind of workplace

01:57.868 --> 01:59.660
You only see on tv shows.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.411
Work's been crazy for me, too.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.664
We have this case--
guy died on his birthday,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.207
And-- get this--
his family had gotten him

02:05.292 --> 02:06.375
An ice cream cake.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.377
You know, the kind
with ice cream inside

02:08.462 --> 02:09.586
As the cake part?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.380
(laughs)

02:11.465 --> 02:14.049
Wild stuff.
So I'm at the scene...

02:14.135 --> 02:16.009
This story is already
too complicated and boring.

02:16.095 --> 02:17.177
Peter, take over.

02:17.263 --> 02:18.887
My amazon guy
once delivered batteries

02:19.014 --> 02:21.181
-To pat sajak.
-No way!

02:21.225 --> 02:23.433
How did he know there were
batteries in the box?

02:23.602 --> 02:24.935
You know,
whenever they ship a battery,

02:25.062 --> 02:26.854
They got to put that little
warning label on the box?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.438
That's how.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.399
It could've just been something
with a battery in it.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.359
No, he said
he shook it real hard.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.361
I-I think
the focus of this story is

02:34.446 --> 02:36.572
More pat sajak than
the battery part.

02:36.699 --> 02:40.325
Hold on. There's no way
that story was better than mine.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.496
Hey, brian. What's all this?

02:44.582 --> 02:46.248
Oh, just following
in the rich tradition

02:46.333 --> 02:47.875
Of hemingway and faulkner

02:47.993 --> 02:49.585
And putting a little damage
on the old liver.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.003
Another rosé, brian?

02:51.130 --> 02:52.379
Put a spritz on it.

02:52.464 --> 02:56.166
So, is, uh, watching tiktoks
of underage girls

02:56.218 --> 02:58.218
Also part of
your writing process?

02:58.304 --> 03:01.471
The best writing happens when
you're not actually writing.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.515
I just wish
my muse would speak to me.

03:03.601 --> 03:06.351
I'm having a tough time finding
an idea for my next novel.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.855
Well, I'd tell you about
one of my murder cases,

03:09.940 --> 03:12.232
But apparently
I'm a bad storyteller.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.235
-Murder case?
-Oh, yeah, we had one last year.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.529
All signs pointed
to the husband.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.281
-What happened?
-It was the husband.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.825
You know, we have
a whole file of cases in quahog

03:21.911 --> 03:23.827
That would make great stories.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.246
A lot of murdered women
out there, bri.

03:26.332 --> 03:28.457
Half of them named britney,
half of them named lacey.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.001
That's one piece of advice
I always give young parents:

03:31.128 --> 03:32.794
Don't name them
britney or lacey.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.004
Yeah, sad stuff.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.964
You know, true crime is huge
right now.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.466
You could be
sitting on a gold mine.

03:37.509 --> 03:38.926
A gold mine, huh?

03:39.011 --> 03:42.221
And this whole day I thought
it was just a smushed dook.

03:44.808 --> 03:47.017
<i> Announcer (on tv):</i>
<i> We now return to</i>
curb your enthusiasm,

03:47.102 --> 03:50.479
<i> Where jeff garlin just repeats</i>
<i> everything larry says.</i>

03:50.606 --> 03:52.397
<i> So, I put on the shirt.</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:54.316
<i> You put on the shirt!</i>

03:54.443 --> 03:55.734
<i> I paid for it.</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:57.402
<i> You paid for it!</i>

03:57.571 --> 03:59.821
<i> I'm starting to think</i>
<i> you're, uh,</i>

03:59.949 --> 04:01.865
<i> The weakest link in the cast.</i>

04:01.951 --> 04:04.409
<i> Easily the weakest link!</i>

04:04.495 --> 04:07.120
Peter, the bank called
to say we're overdrawn,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.122
And the credit card company
sent us a letter

04:09.250 --> 04:11.375
That just says:
"bitch better have my money."

04:11.460 --> 04:12.626
Visa sent that?

04:12.753 --> 04:14.378
God, they can do
whatever they want in delaware.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.338
Thanks for nothing, sleepy joe.

04:16.465 --> 04:19.132
I wonder if this has anything
to do with me not getting paid

04:19.218 --> 04:20.842
During the brewery renovations.

04:20.970 --> 04:23.178
Wh-what do you mean
"not getting paid"?

04:23.264 --> 04:25.013
Well, preston said
we're all transitioning

04:25.057 --> 04:26.723
To being
independent contractors.

04:26.809 --> 04:28.767
The downside is we're losing
our health insurance,

04:28.852 --> 04:31.728
But there's gonna be a pinball
machine in the break room.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.605
Peter, we can't afford
to go two months

04:33.691 --> 04:35.232
Without your paycheck.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.484
You're gonna have to
find a job in the meantime.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.445
Lois, don't worry.
I got it all figured out.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.031
(shoes tapping)

04:51.667 --> 04:53.792
"dear mr. Griffin,
we regret to inform you

04:53.961 --> 04:56.044
That we cannot offer you
a space."

04:57.131 --> 05:00.299
-(shoes tapping)
-(singsongy): Another big
dance check in the mail.

05:00.384 --> 05:04.136
I was just five years away
from three figures a month.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.430
(shoes tapping slowly)

05:11.812 --> 05:12.936
Joe, this stuff is great.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.230
Yep, one man's murdered,
estranged wife

05:15.316 --> 05:16.815
Is another man's treasure.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.110
Brian, I'm gonna have to ask you
to put down the severed limb.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.695
I brought this from home.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.655
Drop it. Drop it!

05:23.741 --> 05:26.825
Ah, damn it, you said "drop it,"
so now I got to drop it.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.703
You know, we should team up
and write a true crime novel.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.954
You don't happen to have
any cases

05:31.040 --> 05:32.831
Featuring pretty blonde women,
do you?

05:33.000 --> 05:34.374
No, those get solved
pretty quickly.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.586
This victim was brunette
and a little heavy.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.171
Okay, getting warmer.

05:39.256 --> 05:42.007
We'll just change a few
key details so people care.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.009
Gutierrez?
Nope, gordon.

05:44.127 --> 05:45.969
Murdered on
an indian reservation?

05:46.055 --> 05:47.346
Let's try beverly hills.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.182
I'm thinking we go novel,
podcast, docuseries,

05:50.267 --> 05:52.100
Then full-blown blockbuster.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.895
But we'd also be doing this
for the families, right?

05:54.980 --> 05:56.388
Is that a new
streaming platform?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.148
No, like, the families
of the victims?

05:58.233 --> 05:59.399
Oh, right. Yeah, sure.

05:59.610 --> 06:01.985
In fact, we'll give them
a sliver of the proceeds.

06:02.154 --> 06:04.112
And I'll give
the fictional version

06:04.198 --> 06:05.697
Of their daughter bigger boobs.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.366
Like-like real heavy naturals.

06:07.409 --> 06:10.660
Oh, yeah, that sounds
like a good compromise.

06:14.583 --> 06:16.291
Your special cart, mrs. G.

06:16.377 --> 06:18.919
Just gave the wheels
a fresh coat of wd-40.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.296
Why, thank you, james.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.675
Oh, roberto, if you weren't
missing half an arm,

06:25.803 --> 06:27.094
I'd definitely consider it.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.721
Oh, how's the 6029s today, hmm?

06:29.848 --> 06:32.099
Oh, mrs. Lois, very fresh.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.850
What's she talking about, mommy?

06:33.977 --> 06:35.685
(laughs) kale, dear.

06:35.771 --> 06:38.313
It's insider speak for kale.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.821
That can't possibly be a thing.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.448
Let me just find someone
to make sure.

06:50.869 --> 06:54.162
Oh, looks like someone
got pulled from the night shift

06:54.248 --> 06:56.957
'cause I've never seen
this free sample.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.669
-Peter?!
<i> -Man (over speakers):</i>
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

07:00.796 --> 07:02.546
<i> We have a plot twist</i>
<i> on aisle four.</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:05.215
<i> I'm the assistant manager</i>
<i> who thinks work should be fun,</i>

07:05.300 --> 07:07.342
<i> And definitely not</i>
<i> a corporate spy</i>

07:07.511 --> 07:09.094
<i> Here to keep unions</i>
<i> from forming.</i>

07:09.221 --> 07:10.929
<i> But now that</i>
<i> we're talking about it,</i>

07:11.056 --> 07:12.389
<i> Can you imagine</i>
<i> if you had a grievance</i>

07:12.474 --> 07:14.433
<i> And couldn't talk to me</i>
<i> directly?</i>

07:14.560 --> 07:15.892
<i> Anyway, I'm elliot,</i>

07:15.978 --> 07:17.352
<i> And I'm paying close attention</i>

07:17.438 --> 07:19.688
<i> To who posts what</i>
<i> on the break room cork board.</i>

07:25.737 --> 07:27.237
Peter, what are you doing here?

07:27.364 --> 07:28.989
You told me to get a job,
and they were hiring.

07:29.116 --> 07:29.948
I love it here!

07:30.075 --> 07:31.116
Plus, they let me joke around

07:31.201 --> 07:33.410
With the wells fargo guys
who work here.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.246
Yes, I'd like to make
a deposit, please.

07:36.331 --> 07:39.124
Is it another 100 grand
chocolate bar?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.084
Okay, so I've had you before.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.045
Peter, the grocery store is
kind of my domain.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.922
While I'm glad you got a job,

07:46.008 --> 07:47.841
I don't love
that you got one here.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.301
Don't worry.
You won't even know I'm here.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.844
Unless you're
near the front door,

07:50.929 --> 07:52.679
Which I can open
with the force.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.848
Excuse me,
where are the peanuts?

07:54.933 --> 07:56.266
Aisle seven.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.351
Peter, peanuts are on aisle two.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.603
Eh, I just tell 'em
whatever number,

07:59.688 --> 08:02.147
And then I disappear
into the produce mist.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.442
Peter? Peter?

08:05.527 --> 08:10.363
Peter (echoing):
There was never peter,
only loose carrots.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.119
The body was discovered
around 9:00 p.M.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.080
Unfortunately, I couldn't
make it down to the crime scene

08:19.166 --> 08:20.624
Because there were no ramps.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.083
Okay, I'm gonna write:

08:22.169 --> 08:24.044
"tonight,
all the streets in this town

08:24.129 --> 08:25.545
Were a dead end."

08:25.631 --> 08:27.088
I never saw the body.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.216
It was cold,
so they sent me on a coffee run.

08:29.343 --> 08:31.384
My lap can
accommodate two trays,

08:31.512 --> 08:32.969
And I can't feel the spills.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.056
"she was found in a creek,
her bosoms frozen solid."

08:36.141 --> 08:39.768
She was a heavyset 60-something
in welder's coveralls.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.270
"no one from beverly hills
had ever been strangled

08:42.356 --> 08:44.189
By their own cheerleader skirt
before."

08:44.316 --> 08:45.607
(gasps)

08:45.776 --> 08:48.610
Wow, I can't believe I'm seeing
how the sausage is made.

08:48.695 --> 08:52.113
Hey, so when you open a book
and you see "random house,"

08:52.199 --> 08:54.241
Is that something
we come up with?

08:54.284 --> 08:56.993
Uh, no, that's-that's
the publisher's name.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.204
I see.
Just drinking it all in.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.331
And what about the list of
cities you see under that name?

09:01.416 --> 09:04.793
Because I was thinking we should
put new york, paris, kokomo.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.212
Those are just the cities
where the publisher has offices.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.089

a major motion picture."

on the writing?

-Yeah?
-So cool.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.115

on all the cans?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.450

<i> from behind a one-way mirror.</i>

09:46.962 --> 09:48.753

10:07.649 --> 10:10.025

10:10.193 --> 10:13.278

10:14.823 --> 10:16.948

-There are gonna be
some changes around here.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.908
First off, no more lipstick.

10:18.994 --> 10:21.745
That's how
all this trouble started.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.167
Okay,
so we just need the ending.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.376
Who was the murderer?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.171
Oh, I have no idea.
It's a cold case.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.715
That's what makes 'em cold--
no one knows how to solve 'em.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.966
Well, how do we finish our novel

10:35.052 --> 10:37.427
If we don't know what happened
in real life?

10:37.512 --> 10:38.928
-Ghost cop.
-No.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.055
Do you know what this means?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.057
We're gonna put on
our sherlock holmes hats

10:42.225 --> 10:44.225
And solve the murder ourselves?

10:44.311 --> 10:46.686
Deerstalker hats, joe.
But yes.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.397
Stupid nonwriter!

10:52.235 --> 10:54.143
Okay, brian, now,
when you're visiting

10:54.196 --> 10:55.695
The family of a deceased victim,

10:55.822 --> 10:57.197
You need to hold a hat
over your chest.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.573
It shows you care.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.742
All I have is this crown
from our burger king lunch.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.160
Hat's a hat.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.247
How can I help you,
officer and your highness?

11:06.408 --> 11:10.085
Hi, yes. We're here with many
questions about your daughter.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.878
You know, the dead one?
You-you remember her?

11:11.963 --> 11:13.588
We'd love any details.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.715
Is this some sort of sick joke?

11:15.801 --> 11:17.050
I assure you it's not, ma'am.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.885
We're writing
a future hit novel

11:18.970 --> 11:20.053
Based on your daughter's murder.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.471
We just need to know who did it.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.182
And, between us, it'd be great
if one of you did.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.934
What is this?
What do you want?

11:26.019 --> 11:27.811
Did you know
jonbenét ramsey's dad

11:27.896 --> 11:30.438
Dated natalee holloway's mom?

11:30.524 --> 11:32.023
What does that have to do
with our case?

11:32.109 --> 11:33.942
Well, nothing,
it's just kind of weird, right?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.986
Do you happen to have
any grainy video footage

11:37.072 --> 11:40.073
Of her singing an emotional song
at a talent show?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.574
Maybe green day's
"time of your life"?

11:41.702 --> 11:44.577
That would really bust
this project wide open for us.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.705
You're both unwell.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.541
Well, that was a bust.

11:49.668 --> 11:52.252
Sorry, I've been holding this in
since burger king.

11:52.337 --> 11:54.212
Oh, seriously? You're just
gonna leave that there?

11:54.339 --> 11:57.006
These people have suffered
a terrible loss.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.259
At least cover it with leaves
or something.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.760
Ugh, fine.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.099
Joe, look.
I found something.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.477
-It's a key to a storage unit.
-How do you know that?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.021
Yeah, me and bonnie have been
doing a fun role-play thing

12:12.149 --> 12:14.065
Where she dresses up
like a sexy maid

12:14.151 --> 12:17.277
And then locks me in a storage
unit while guys come over.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.237
-Oh.
-Yeah, it's pretty kinky.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.323
I, uh, I play the role of
a sexy armoire,

12:22.409 --> 12:23.908
Waiting in another room.

12:23.994 --> 12:26.786
Sounds like she just wants you
out of the house for a while.

12:26.872 --> 12:29.205
Nah. No.

12:34.212 --> 12:36.254

It's a big store.

-fine.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.687
What do you got that's fresh?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.230
Well, I got
a teenage son at home.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.149
-What a mouth on that kid.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.985

13:01.531 --> 13:04.449
Um, excuse me, miss, did you
just yell at this employee?

13:04.576 --> 13:05.950
You're damn right I did.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.077
He has no business being here.

13:08.163 --> 13:10.705
This man is a member
of the stop 'n shop family.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.916
He has every business
being here.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.084
You, on the other hand,
will have to go.

13:15.212 --> 13:16.377
You're banned from the store.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.087
(chuckles nervously):
What? No.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.380
Y-you can't do this.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.787
Where I buy food for the family.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.122
It's my escape.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.374
My refuge
from being pestered

18:46.459 --> 18:47.875
With dumb questions
from the kids,

18:47.961 --> 18:49.627
Or having to clean up
your messes.

18:49.754 --> 18:52.964
Sometimes, just a stroll
down the ethnic food aisle

18:53.049 --> 18:55.508
Makes me feel like
I'm in a north african bazaar.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.510
Yeah, I don't like the smells
on that aisle.

18:57.679 --> 19:00.847
-And I don't know,
it's hard to explain, but...
-There's more?!

19:00.932 --> 19:03.516
It's not just
a grocery store to me.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.685
There's a whole
community of people there

19:05.770 --> 19:07.186
Who feel like family.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.647
And now,
now I have nothing.

19:09.732 --> 19:13.860
Aw, lois, I'm so sorry
for ruining your happy place.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.695
And I'm gonna take care of it.

19:15.780 --> 19:18.114
Just like I've been taking care
of that egg since high school.

19:18.283 --> 19:21.075
Oh, my god, I forgot to pick
him up from soccer practice!

19:21.995 --> 19:25.037
Hey, do you need me
to call your yolks?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.417
Look, you got to let lois
come back.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.836
Please remove the ban.
She loves this place.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.087
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.548
She yelled at
a mentally-challenged person,

19:35.633 --> 19:36.674
And that's unforgivable.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.217
What?
I'm not mentally challenged.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.136
You're not?
But that's literally

19:40.221 --> 19:42.096
The only reason we hired you.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.600
Would a mentally challenged
person be able to do this?

19:49.814 --> 19:52.148
Your name tag says "big petey."

19:52.233 --> 19:54.233
(scoffs) why do you think
we all gather round

19:54.360 --> 19:55.985
And applaud you while you ride

19:56.029 --> 19:57.612
The coin-operated horse
out front?

19:57.697 --> 19:58.946
'cause I'm good at horses?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.365
Wow. (chuckles)
I really thought...

20:01.451 --> 20:03.743
You know, we don't let
all our employees insist

20:03.870 --> 20:06.621
The customers feel their muscles
after bagging their order.

20:06.664 --> 20:07.872
Right?

20:07.999 --> 20:09.040
Okay, fine.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.000
Lois can come back,
but you're fired.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.835
I need you to turn in
your gun and badge.

20:13.004 --> 20:15.421
Well, I guess
my work here is done.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.215
To the mickey-copter!

20:19.886 --> 20:21.010
See, disney?

20:21.095 --> 20:23.179
Nothing here
but respectful synergy.

20:32.357 --> 20:34.440
What happened to
the open floor plan?

20:34.567 --> 20:37.151
Long story. The wework guy
took our entire budget

20:37.278 --> 20:39.528
For the project
as a holiday bonus.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.697
But he has long hair
and speaks confidently

20:41.741 --> 20:42.823
About the internet,

20:42.909 --> 20:44.825
So he will get about
eight more chances.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.495
Ah, yes, the wework guy.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.958
They thought he had created
a $47 billion unicorn.

20:52.043 --> 20:55.336
Turns out it was only
a two-bit donkey.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.421
That's wet paint,
by the way.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.674
Ah, son of a...
