Stewie, I would never try to...
Really? Ew.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.305
Brian, we need to go to 2060
to find out what happened.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.434
That's not your normal time pad.
Where'd you get that?

12:47.517 --> 12:48.977
I borrowed it from Rick and Morty.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.854
They've borrowed plenty from us.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.446
(lasers firing)

13:07.078 --> 13:10.331
Oh, my God, it's all true.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.631
Sir, the Bri-bots are advancing.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.969
Brian, look.
There I am.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.471
Why are you wearing a half shirt?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.973
Probably 'cause, like, war and stuff.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.350
Wait, Stewie, where are you going?

13:28.433 --> 13:29.934
I have to talk to myself, Brian,

13:30.018 --> 13:31.186
and find out what happened.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.937
Plus, can you imagine how many likes

13:33.021 --> 13:34.689
this post gets on Instagram?

13:34.773 --> 13:36.316
Me with future me?

13:36.399 --> 13:39.444
That's like
"Stewie won the Internet" good.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.656
BOTH:
Brian?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.202
(gasps)
You're me.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.454
Yes.
I've come because my Terminator robot

13:49.537 --> 13:50.872
just tried to kill me.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.041
What happened?
Brian and I were friends.

13:53.124 --> 13:55.794
He ruined what could have been
a perfect Instagram post

13:55.877 --> 13:57.295
with a sarcastic comment.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.005
Ugh, I hate that.

13:59.089 --> 14:01.341
Oh, that reminds me,
I've got to get this pic.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.009
Wait a minute,
what should we do in the picture?

14:03.093 --> 14:04.386
I don't know, something fun?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.429
Well, the caption is going
to be "Double Trouble,"

14:06.513 --> 14:08.390
so let's work backwards from there.

14:08.473 --> 14:11.101
♪ Have you heard? It's in the stars ♪

14:11.184 --> 14:14.646
♪ Next July we collide with Mars. ♪

14:14.729 --> 14:18.358
So I have to ask.
Is there a Mrs. Stewie Griffin?

14:18.441 --> 14:20.110
Oh, man, I so wanted to.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.736
It's just this war and whatnot, you know?

14:21.820 --> 14:23.154
No, no, I totally get it.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.532
Wait a minute, since there's two of us,

14:25.615 --> 14:27.242
this means we can finally...

14:27.325 --> 14:28.743
BOTH:
...catch our own tail.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.578
(growling, grumbling)

14:30.662 --> 14:32.539
-I got it.
-No, I got it.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.165
-No, I got it.
-I got it.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.376
(grumbling)

14:38.461 --> 14:40.171
There they are.
Get 'em.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.845
Brian, we've got to get out of here.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.434
Oh, Stewie, my hero.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.310
Not now, babe.
The war.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.563
All right, jump, touch the branch,

14:56.646 --> 14:59.399
send these right back
to Zappos for the refund.

15:02.485 --> 15:06.781
My God, we do become enemies.
That makes me sad.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.867
Look, that future hasn't happened yet.

15:08.950 --> 15:12.370
We can avoid it by protecting
our friendship at all costs.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.247
You're right.
We just need a car,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.790
then we can figure out how to do this.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.375
Just like the fat man figured out

15:17.459 --> 15:19.419
how to get into cosmetology school.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.838
Hi, I'm a drug addict with a child.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.381
All right, come on in.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.468
And, um, will I be using
the little head rakes?

15:26.551 --> 15:30.138
-You mean combs?
-I have so much to learn.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.767
Hey, love you, buddy.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.393
Love you, too, pal.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.936
See?
This is fine. Friends forever.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.813
We control our own fate.

15:38.897 --> 15:42.609
Yes. Nothing is set in stone.
We make our own decisions.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.571
-Do we really need the heat on?
-It's the defrost.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.448
But whatever it is,
do you really need it on?

15:48.531 --> 15:51.159
If you want me to see out the window, yes.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.203
Of course, you're the driver.
Sorry.

15:53.286 --> 15:56.122
-Love you, buddy.
-Love you, buddy.

16:05.173 --> 16:06.966
Do you really think sunflower seeds is

16:07.050 --> 16:08.510
the best choice of snack

16:08.593 --> 16:10.470
-while we're trying
not to hate each other?
-What?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.472
I'm just thinking
maybe there's a better snack.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.557
That's... I-I don't know.
I love you, buddy.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.726
Okay, that's cool.
But maybe you just, uh,

16:16.810 --> 16:20.480
let me eat whatever I feel like.
Love you, buddy.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.733
My "driving exactly
the speed limit" buddy.

16:23.817 --> 16:25.527
(siren blaring)

16:25.610 --> 16:26.820
Damn it.
How am I getting pulled over?

16:26.903 --> 16:28.488
I was driving exactly the speed limit.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.948
You sure were.

16:34.869 --> 16:37.080
This cop looks like Lois.

16:37.163 --> 16:39.416
(robotic voice):
Hello, Brian.

16:39.499 --> 16:42.460
Brian, that's not a cop.
That's a Lois Terminator.

16:44.713 --> 16:46.798
(gunshot)

16:49.843 --> 16:52.345
Jingle All the Way.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.022
Oh, yeah?
Watch this.

17:04.024 --> 17:07.068
Uhp, guess I'm back
to the old-model Terminator.

17:07.152 --> 17:09.779
Artists must've got tired
of drawing the new one.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.866
Yeah, that's it.
Punch that one.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.493
Look out behind you.
No, behind you.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.465
What the hell is going on?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.800
Future me must have sent her
back to protect me

17:30.884 --> 17:33.136
-and kill you.
-(wind whooshing)

17:33.219 --> 17:34.387
Oh, my God, look.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.562
Our future selves must know

17:42.645 --> 17:44.522
we're deprogramming their Terminators.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.815
They're sending back more.

17:45.899 --> 17:49.444
Is this the Conover family reunion?

17:49.527 --> 17:51.196
I'm looking around...

17:51.279 --> 17:54.616
This is not.
This is not.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.709
(tires screeching)

18:09.839 --> 18:11.299
Stewie, what the hell are we gonna do?

18:11.383 --> 18:14.010
Our future selves will continue
sending Terminators back

18:14.094 --> 18:16.846
-to kill us as long as we're enemies.
-(phone chimes)

18:16.930 --> 18:20.642
Oh, "Brian Griffin has commented
on your Instagram post."

18:25.146 --> 18:27.732
"When Sally Met Sally"?
What the hell?!

18:27.816 --> 18:29.526
Relax, Stewie.
Take a joke.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.528
Come on, Brian, an early sarcastic comment

18:31.611 --> 18:33.321
brings likes to a grinding halt.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.281
Oh, my God, your comment is getting

18:35.365 --> 18:36.616
more likes than the post.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.410
Stewie, you can't post
a picture like that.

18:38.493 --> 18:40.453
It's so clear you're just
in love with yourself.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.539
Says the guy who constantly updates

18:42.622 --> 18:43.915
his own Wikipedia page.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.417
That's supposed to be anonymous.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.878
-Oh, like all your alcoholic buddies?
-Go to hell!

18:48.962 --> 18:50.296
(tires screeching)

18:50.380 --> 18:53.049
-You go to hell.
-(grunting)

18:54.676 --> 18:56.636
Wait, stop.
Don't you see, Brian?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.805
This is it.
This is the rift.

18:58.888 --> 19:01.391
Oh, my God, you're right.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.980
Here come the Terminators.
What do we do?

19:07.063 --> 19:09.315
We've got to show them that
our friendship is unbreakable.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.359
That we love each other.

19:11.443 --> 19:14.988
-Brian, we have to kiss.
-Oh, come on, Stewie.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.865
No, no, no, no, no.
I-I know I can sometimes

19:16.948 --> 19:18.867
do stuff like this, and again, I apologize

19:18.950 --> 19:20.994
for what happened at the motel.
That was a big mix-up.

19:21.077 --> 19:23.371
But the writer in you knows it's true.

19:23.455 --> 19:24.622
All right, fine.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.211
-Stewie...
-I'm doing it for you.

19:40.430 --> 19:43.141
-Brian, it's working.
-How much longer?

19:43.224 --> 19:45.143
Sorry, didn't realize it was such a chore.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.025
What about now?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.860
Almost, Brian.
Keep kissing.

19:59.574 --> 20:01.743
STEWIE: Aw, he got both of us.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.540
