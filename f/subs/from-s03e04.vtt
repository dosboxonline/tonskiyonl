- [stammers] My ankle.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.569
- It's dislocated.
- All right.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.381
- I'll take the bus.
- Why?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.591
Because I wanna

At nighttime,
everyone had to hide.

09:18.100 --> 09:20.017
There were
no talismans then.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.103
But during the daytime,

09:22.104 --> 09:26.024

play inside the houses.

When I was a boy, my mother
tried to save everyone,

10:14.156 --> 10:17.033
but she died.
And then everyone died,

10:17.034 --> 10:21.954
and I can't
remember how or why.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.957
And I think I need to
remember soon.

are changing.

here before.

in the basement.

when we stopped at that tree.

the GPS say?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.076

ago--data unavailable.

The woods aren't this deep.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.996
Okay, fine.
I'll turn around.

11:03.997 --> 11:04.997
No, no, no!
Please don't turn around!

11:04.998 --> 11:07.833
Uh, just--just
keep going forward.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.001
- Whoa. Lady, calm down.
- If you turn around,

11:09.002 --> 11:11.087
you'll be driving
away from town!

11:11.088 --> 11:13.839
What town?
We're looking for the highway.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.967
I know, I know, but, uh...

11:16.968 --> 11:18.260
you have to listen to me.
It's, uh--

11:18.261 --> 11:20.221
It's not safe to stop out here
once it gets dark,

11:20.222 --> 11:22.973
but there's
a town up ahead,

11:22.974 --> 11:24.433
and-- and people
there can help us.

11:24.434 --> 11:26.186
You just-- you just need
to keep going forward, please!

11:38.990 --> 11:41.867
So, you're gonna
watch these things,

11:41.868 --> 11:44.245
get a sense of how
they move and what they do,

11:44.246 --> 11:46.872
and that's gonna what?

11:46.873 --> 11:49.917
Give you some grand insight
into how you're gonna catch one?

11:49.918 --> 11:52.921
Yeah. Something like that.

11:54.172 --> 11:55.965
Yeah. Okay.

11:55.966 --> 11:58.009
I'm sure nothing terrible
is gonna come of that.

12:00.095 --> 12:01.137
Why are you here?

12:01.138 --> 12:04.056
What do you mean?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.225
I said we could switch.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.895
You could be fast asleep by
now in the sheriff's station.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.939
So, why are you here?

12:11.940 --> 12:13.984
That's none
of your business.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.074
What the fuck
do you care, anyway?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.243
'Cause if I gotta stand here
all night and listen to you,

12:24.244 --> 12:27.079
I'd at least like
to know why that is.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.039
Look, if you're
gonna do something

12:29.040 --> 12:30.249
that has even
the slightest chance

12:30.250 --> 12:32.001
of getting us
the hell out of here,

12:32.002 --> 12:33.085
no matter how stupid
or ill-advised

12:33.086 --> 12:36.172
that thing might be...

12:36.173 --> 12:37.965
then I wanna help.

12:37.966 --> 12:42.970
Oh. So, now, all of a sudden,
you're a team player.

12:42.971 --> 12:45.264
If you'd seen
the things I've seen,

12:45.265 --> 12:47.141
then you might be, too.

12:47.142 --> 12:51.103
What are you talking about,
seen the things you've seen?

12:51.104 --> 12:53.231
What do you think
I'm talking about, Boyd?

12:55.358 --> 12:58.944
Me, Julie, Marielle,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.198
wherever we were.

13:03.325 --> 13:06.327
Everybody here just talks about
how afraid they are of dying.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.954
Well, I don't think
that's the worst thing

13:08.955 --> 13:10.332
that can happen
to you here.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.044
I want out.

13:16.379 --> 13:19.298
[fire crackling]

13:19.299 --> 13:21.175
[pencil scribbling]

13:21.176 --> 13:25.013
[groaning softly]

13:26.264 --> 13:27.223
You should get
some sleep.

13:27.224 --> 13:30.184
Tomorrow's gonna
be a long day.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.393
Sorry.
Did I wake you up?

13:31.394 --> 13:34.314
No. The, uh, throbbing pain
in my ankle did.

13:37.234 --> 13:41.153
Is there anything I can
do to help make it better?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.239
[groaning]

13:43.240 --> 13:47.077
No, not until, uh, some
of the swelling goes down.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.206
What are you writing?

13:54.125 --> 13:58.003
It's just, uh,
something for my mom.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.339
In Chinese culture,
we write letters to the dead

14:00.340 --> 14:03.092
on high holidays.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.052
It's not really a holiday,
I guess, but...

14:05.053 --> 14:07.179
I think she'd
really like that.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.390
Yep.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.183
I meant what
I said earlier.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.353
You're not alone here.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.397
Things are different now.
That's all.

14:16.398 --> 14:19.108
Yeah.

14:19.109 --> 14:23.071
It just feels like
all of a sudden...

14:25.115 --> 14:27.409
...everything that I thought
I was fighting for is gone.

14:31.454 --> 14:34.124
And everything that I thought
I was going home to.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.086
And the two people that
I would talk to about that

14:39.087 --> 14:42.339
are you and Mom.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.217
You can still talk to me.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.138
[Jade] Could you maybe
talk in the morning?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.433
Sorry.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.144
[sighs] Fuck it.

14:55.145 --> 14:57.230
[grunts] I'm awake.

15:07.365 --> 15:08.450
Hey.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.328
[groaning]

15:12.329 --> 15:14.456
You guys wanna hear
something crazy?

15:18.168 --> 15:21.295
The night everyone died,

15:21.296 --> 15:22.463
I was in the root cellar.

15:22.464 --> 15:26.342
My mother told Eloise and I
to hide there.

15:26.343 --> 15:29.137
Eloise didn't listen.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.479
But I did.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.157
I stayed until morning.

15:52.494 --> 15:56.163
And when I came out,

15:56.164 --> 15:57.332
there were bodies
everywhere.

16:02.545 --> 16:05.256
That was the day that
I met the boy in white.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.135
You know the boy
in white?

16:10.136 --> 16:11.637
He's my friend.

16:11.638 --> 16:15.224
He was my only friend all
those years that I was alone.

16:15.225 --> 16:21.481
[creaking]

16:26.528 --> 16:29.530
Couldn't bury them all.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.448
They were just lying there
in the street,

16:31.449 --> 16:34.369
and I--I couldn't bury them.

16:37.372 --> 16:40.541
So the boy in white told me

16:40.542 --> 16:45.380
to gather things that were
precious to them.

16:49.259 --> 16:50.552
To bury those instead.

16:54.556 --> 16:58.225
This stuff--

16:58.226 --> 17:00.270
that'll help you remember
why it happened?

17:01.396 --> 17:03.314
I think so.

17:04.566 --> 17:06.526
Why are we in here?

17:07.610 --> 17:10.238
Because it's a fort.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.531
Why do you need me?

17:12.532 --> 17:16.327
Because I don't want
to do this alone.

17:19.497 --> 17:22.375
I may have to remember
some scary things.

17:23.626 --> 17:25.419
And you're the scariest
person here,

17:25.420 --> 17:27.297
so it won't scare <i>you.</i>

17:34.679 --> 17:36.388
You always
this fidgety?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.390
Something's wrong.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.392
Those things should be
all over the place by now.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.560
Really?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.312
These things give
"creature of habit"

17:43.313 --> 17:45.481
a whole new
goddamn meaning.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.565
The one
in the nurse's uniform?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.276
I'm her first stop
every night,

17:49.277 --> 17:50.444
every single night.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.529
She just stands by the glass,
and she hums.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.490
For about ten minutes,
she just stands,

17:54.491 --> 17:56.283
taps on the glass
with her fucking smile.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.536
And there's another one, right?

17:59.537 --> 18:01.413
Likes to sit over there
by the swing.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.374
- Okay.
- Just letting its legs dangle.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.584
There's another couple like
to sit over there

18:05.585 --> 18:07.419
by the pool, just--

18:07.420 --> 18:09.463
Well, you really
watch these things closely.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.632
Yeah, well,
there's no TV.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.634
Plus, you guys get to
draw the shades at night.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.594
I got...

18:15.595 --> 18:19.515
Look. The point is,
they got patterns, routines,

18:19.516 --> 18:21.643
all of which should be
happening right now.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.562
Right now.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.606
Ma'am, you're
not making any sense.

18:27.607 --> 18:30.442
I know this road!
There's a town up ahead.

18:30.443 --> 18:31.527
The people there can help us
find the highway again.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.278
- Okay.
- I promise you.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.656
We just need to keep
going that way.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.329
We're--we're here!
The barn is here!

18:42.330 --> 18:43.622
- We're--Stop! Stop here!
- Lady, we're fine, okay?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.374
We're not gonna stop
in the middle of nowhere.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.376
Fuck.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.377
[vehicle approaching]

18:48.378 --> 18:50.629
Oh, shit. What the...

18:50.630 --> 18:52.465
What the fuck?

18:54.634 --> 18:57.595
It's an ambulance,
just like he said!

18:59.764 --> 19:01.349
Hey!

19:03.560 --> 19:04.519
Hey!

19:05.645 --> 19:06.687
Mom!

19:06.688 --> 19:08.522
Oh, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!

19:08.523 --> 19:09.523
- [Jim] Get in here!
- I got him.

19:09.524 --> 19:10.524
- [Jim] Hey!
- [Ethan] No!

19:10.525 --> 19:11.567
- [Boyd] Got him.
- No!

19:11.568 --> 19:13.569
- Let's get back inside.
- No! Mom!

19:13.570 --> 19:15.320
You need to stop.
Please stop.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.530
Look, lady. I'm not gonna
tell you again, okay?

19:16.531 --> 19:18.449
Shit.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.453
- What's wrong?
- We got a body in the road.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.581
What if Mom's really
out there?

19:25.582 --> 19:27.457
- What's he talking about?
- Uh--

19:27.458 --> 19:29.586
The voice on the phone said
she'd be on an ambulance.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.338
There's somebody lying
in the middle of the road.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.424
No. It's not
a fucking person!

19:35.425 --> 19:36.508
- Hey! Hey!
- Jesus! Hey!

19:36.509 --> 19:37.593
- That is not a fucking person!
- Okay!

19:37.594 --> 19:39.636
We're just gonna calm down, okay?

19:39.637 --> 19:41.346
- No, no, no!
- Go ahead. I got this.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.556
You are not fucking
listening to me.

19:42.557 --> 19:44.474
Where are you going?
Don't go.

19:44.475 --> 19:46.393
- Please don't fucking go!
- Ma'am!

19:46.394 --> 19:47.895
- [officer] Move!
- Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.563
- You're gonna fucking die!
- Okay. You need to calm down!

19:49.564 --> 19:51.690
You need to fucking calm down!
They're gonna die!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.401
They're gonna fucking die!

19:59.782 --> 20:01.491
- Jesus.
- Oh, my God.

20:01.492 --> 20:02.576
Ma'am, can you hear me?

20:02.577 --> 20:04.745
- Okay.
- Here. Help me roll her over.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.538
Come on.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
Watch her head.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.627
I'm not getting
a pulse.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.545
Hey, guys!

20:13.546 --> 20:15.589
Lady's really freaking out
back here.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.383
What the...

20:18.384 --> 20:20.385
- [screeching]
- Aah!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.386
[screeching]

20:21.387 --> 20:22.512
[grunting]

20:22.513 --> 20:23.598
[choking]

20:25.558 --> 20:26.683
Oh, my God!

20:26.684 --> 20:28.685
Aah!

20:28.686 --> 20:31.647
[groaning]

20:31.648 --> 20:35.652
[screeching]

20:39.697 --> 20:40.698
Back up!

20:42.533 --> 20:43.493
[firing shot]

20:44.827 --> 20:46.745
[gun firing twice]

20:46.746 --> 20:48.705
- Okay.
- [Julie] Those were gunshots!

20:48.706 --> 20:50.458
Which means those things are
already out there.

20:52.710 --> 20:55.505
[panting]

21:02.887 --> 21:05.515
[panting]

21:08.518 --> 21:10.560
Oh, my God. Henry?

21:10.561 --> 21:13.480
- [groaning] What?
- It's okay.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.773
- What?
- We're okay.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.526
If there's even a chance
my wife is out there...

21:17.527 --> 21:18.486
You do what you want.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.823
Okay. Listen.
You gotta stay inside.

21:22.824 --> 21:24.783
Whoever's on that ambulance,
you'll be putting them

21:24.784 --> 21:27.452
in danger if we have to worry
about you, okay?

21:27.453 --> 21:28.745
I need you to
tell me you understand.

21:28.746 --> 21:29.788
- I understand.
- Julie?

21:29.789 --> 21:30.790
Yeah.

21:33.835 --> 21:35.627
We are
in real danger right now.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.587
There are things in this town
that will hurt us

21:37.588 --> 21:39.464
if we don't get inside
one of the houses.

21:39.465 --> 21:40.590
- [creature screeching]
- [gasping]

21:40.591 --> 21:41.675
- Ah!
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

21:41.676 --> 21:43.677
Oh, mother of God!

21:43.678 --> 21:44.846
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

21:46.931 --> 21:48.724
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

21:48.725 --> 21:50.600
Tabitha.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.562
Oh, my God! Jim! Jim!

21:53.938 --> 21:55.689
Help me! Help me!

21:55.690 --> 21:57.566
Please help me, baby!

21:57.567 --> 21:59.818
- Please help us!
- Are there keys?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.653
I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know where they are!

22:01.654 --> 22:03.530
Everybody, out of
the ambulance, now!

22:03.531 --> 22:04.574
Ah!

22:05.700 --> 22:07.701
- Jesus.
- What the fuck?

22:07.702 --> 22:10.662
- Handcuffs.
- What?

22:10.663 --> 22:12.539
You have handcuffs.
Hand me the keys.

22:12.540 --> 22:16.752
I--I--I don't
have them. I--No--

22:16.753 --> 22:18.670
There's a toolkit
on the bus. I got it.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.715
- No! Wait, wait!
- Got it!

22:21.966 --> 22:23.759
All right!
Stay, stay, stay!

22:23.760 --> 22:25.552
- [clanging]
- Runner on the hill!

22:25.553 --> 22:26.928
Runner on the hill!

22:26.929 --> 22:29.598
- [clanging continuing]
- [people talking excitedly]

22:29.599 --> 22:33.560
[panting]

22:33.561 --> 22:38.690
- [firing gun]
- [screeching]

22:38.691 --> 22:40.567
- [firing gun]
- I think it's a cop.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.695
- [creature screeching]
- What the fuck? [panting]

22:43.696 --> 22:44.655
[firing gun]

22:45.782 --> 22:47.742
[creature screeching]

22:50.745 --> 22:51.703
- [firing gun]
- [glass shattering]

22:51.704 --> 22:52.954
- Ah!
- [people screaming]

22:52.955 --> 22:54.664
- [woman] What was that?
- Nicky's been shot!

22:54.665 --> 22:55.874
[Marielle] Excuse me.
Excuse me.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.876
- [Nicky groans]
- [Ellis] What happened?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.669
- Did she hit her head?
- I don't know.

22:59.670 --> 23:00.712
Get that window boarded up.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.047
Um, here,
get her onto the couch.

23:02.048 --> 23:06.593
- [people shouting]
- [man] Let her have some air.

23:06.594 --> 23:08.720
- [Marielle] Come on.
- All right. All right.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.640
[people chattering]

23:11.641 --> 23:12.974
- [man] Did you see?
- It's Nicky?

23:12.975 --> 23:14.810
Hey, Nicky. I'm Marielle.
I'm gonna help you, okay?

23:14.811 --> 23:18.730
- [man] Easy, easy.
- [Nicky groaning]

23:18.731 --> 23:20.899
Help me roll her onto her side.
Okay. All right.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.818
[Nicky shouting in pain]

23:22.819 --> 23:24.946
Okay. No exit wound.
We need to get this bullet out.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.615
- [rattling, knocking]
- Hey, open up!

23:28.616 --> 23:29.991
- I'm a police officer!
- Hey, move.

23:29.992 --> 23:31.284
- What are you doing?
- [cop] Please! Open the door!

23:31.285 --> 23:33.912
She's a cop. We can't just
leave her out there.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.705
We should wait for Kristi.

23:35.706 --> 23:37.249
Kristi's not back until
tomorrow.

23:37.250 --> 23:38.959
We need to do this now. Hey, I'm
gonna need a lot of things--

23:38.960 --> 23:40.919
uh, tweezers, pliers,
uh, alcohol, and towels.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.879
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.924
[Nicky shouting in pain]

23:45.925 --> 23:47.717
- [Marielle] I know.
- [Nicky shouting]

23:47.718 --> 23:49.594
- [Marielle] Okay.
- [metal clattering]

23:49.595 --> 23:53.598
[Nicky shouting in pain]

23:53.599 --> 23:54.766
- [Marielle] Yes.
- Oh, my God.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.934
[Nicky shouting in pain]

23:55.935 --> 23:58.603
- Okay.
- [Nicky shouting in pain]

23:58.604 --> 24:01.731
Oh, God. Those things were
coming from everywhere.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.650
- Back off!
- I didn't mean to--No. Listen.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.652
You gotta believe me.
Please, you gotta believe me.

24:05.653 --> 24:06.987
- It must have been a misfire!
- I said back the fuck up!

24:06.988 --> 24:09.906
Oh, God. This isn't real.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.825
This isn't real. This--
this can't be happening.

24:11.826 --> 24:12.951
This isn't real.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.953
- Is there anyone with you?
- What?

24:14.954 --> 24:17.789
- Is there anyone else out there?
- Is she gonna be okay?

24:17.790 --> 24:18.707
How did you get here?

24:18.708 --> 24:20.792
We were in an ambulance.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.003
There was this--this--
this tree.

24:24.005 --> 24:28.968
[insects buzzing]

24:31.804 --> 24:34.015
Where are the--
can't find the fucking keys.

24:39.061 --> 24:40.687
Get the fuck back.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.731
I said get the fuck back!

24:42.732 --> 24:44.816
Oh, sweetie,
it doesn't work that way.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.027
[grunting]

24:52.742 --> 24:53.742
Hey, get back to the bus!

24:53.743 --> 24:55.703
[insects buzzing]

24:58.915 --> 25:01.750
[yelping]

25:01.751 --> 25:05.003
- Hey, Jim!
- Hey. Tools.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.005
- [Jim] Boyd, we got to go.
- [Boyd] Yeah.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.924
[Tabitha] Get something!
Get something!

25:08.925 --> 25:10.842
[Henry groaning]

25:10.843 --> 25:13.845
I can't find the fucking keys!

25:13.846 --> 25:15.847
- Where the--
- Are you looking for these?

25:15.848 --> 25:18.725
Motherfucker! [panting]

25:18.726 --> 25:21.019
- Take them.
- [panting]

25:21.020 --> 25:22.897
We get to keep Randall, though.

25:24.899 --> 25:27.735
- [buzzing]
- [choking, coughing]

25:31.906 --> 25:33.074
Get off me! [grunts]

25:33.574 --> 25:37.035
- [Randall grunting]
- You can't save them all.

25:37.036 --> 25:40.914
Ah! [grunting]

25:40.915 --> 25:42.959
[panting]

25:47.088 --> 25:48.839
[Jim] Boyd, let's go!
We gotta get out of here!

25:51.926 --> 25:54.844
Fuck you! Fuck you!

25:54.845 --> 25:57.722
- Motherfuckers.
- Fuck you!

25:57.723 --> 26:00.725
[engine starts]

26:00.726 --> 26:03.812
Boyd? Boyd, don't you leave me,
you piece of shit!

26:03.813 --> 26:05.021
[creature screeching]

26:05.022 --> 26:07.107
Apply pressure
right here.

26:07.108 --> 26:09.777
- [moaning]
- Okay. All right. Good.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.863
- Good. Okay. Good.
- Yeah?

26:13.864 --> 26:15.865
Hey, hey. Are you
sure you've got this?

26:15.866 --> 26:17.075
Yeah. Yeah. I got it.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.785
Sit here.

26:18.786 --> 26:19.786
Hold her legs down.

26:19.787 --> 26:21.037
Okay. Okay. I got it.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.873
- [Marielle] Keep her still.
- [Nicky moaning]

26:23.874 --> 26:25.041
- [Ellis] Come on.
- [Marielle] Okay. Yeah.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.084
- Little sting.
- [Nicky shouting]

26:26.085 --> 26:28.795
I know. I know. I know.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.755
Shit. Okay. Let me see.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.090
- Okay.
- [Marielle] Okay. Let me see.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.801
Bite down. Bite down.

26:35.011 --> 26:36.886
- Hold her very still.
- [Ellis] Come on, Nicky.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.930
- [Marielle] Here we go.
- [Nicky shouting in pain]

26:38.931 --> 26:40.140
- All right. Here we go.
- [shouting]

26:40.141 --> 26:42.017
- I know. I know.
- [Fatima] You got this.

26:42.018 --> 26:44.978
- [Marielle] All right.
- [Fatima] It's okay. It's okay.

26:44.979 --> 26:47.105
[Nicky shouting]

26:47.106 --> 26:48.106
Okay. I think I got it.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.900
[Nicky shouting]

26:50.901 --> 26:51.943
Okay.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.071
[Nicky shouting]

26:55.072 --> 26:56.865
Okay. I got it.

26:56.866 --> 26:57.949
[Nicky shouting]

26:57.950 --> 26:59.075
Yeah.

26:59.076 --> 27:00.077
Good job.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.830
There's a woman
in the ambulance.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.165
There were two paramedics
outside, and I don't know

27:05.166 --> 27:07.001
where she is, but this is
probably 20 minutes...

27:19.055 --> 27:20.848
It's okay.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.142
- Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes!
- That's it. That's it.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.978
- Yes! Thank you!
- All right. Can you get up?

27:26.979 --> 27:27.979
- Yes.
- Yeah?

27:27.980 --> 27:29.939
Henry, let's go.
Let's go, Henry.

27:29.940 --> 27:30.941
- And you? Can you walk?
- I think so.

27:32.109 --> 27:35.111
[Henry moaning]

27:35.112 --> 27:36.988
Come on. Come on.
I got you. I got you.

27:36.989 --> 27:38.198
[moaning]

27:38.199 --> 27:39.158
You okay?

27:42.244 --> 27:45.163
[shuts off engine]

27:45.164 --> 27:46.998
- [Boyd] I got him!
- Oh, my God! Hurry!

27:46.999 --> 27:48.958
I got him. I got him. I got him.
I got him. Come here.

27:48.959 --> 27:50.126
- Come here.
- [creature screeching]

27:50.127 --> 27:51.211
I got you. I got you.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.004
Let's go.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.840
[people murmuring quietly]

27:55.841 --> 27:57.133
[Boyd] There you go.
Come on.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.177
[people murmuring excitedly]

27:59.178 --> 28:00.929
- Oh.
- [Boyd] There you go.

28:00.930 --> 28:03.182
- There you go. Close that door.
- [Henry moaning]

28:04.266 --> 28:06.184
[door closes, metal clattering]

28:06.185 --> 28:09.062
[people murmuring]

28:09.063 --> 28:10.189
You okay?

28:12.274 --> 28:13.858
Look.

28:13.859 --> 28:14.984
[people murmuring]

28:14.985 --> 28:18.239
- [man] Bad idea.
- [people murmuring]

28:22.326 --> 28:23.952
Hey, what happened?

28:23.953 --> 28:26.205
Uh, it was a long night.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.998
For everyone, it seems.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.043
[people murmuring]

28:34.046 --> 28:35.214
I fucking told you.

28:38.175 --> 28:41.010
Donna, can we, uh--

28:41.011 --> 28:44.098
Uh, you can. Uh, I'll put you
in a room upstairs.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.975
Are you okay?

28:46.976 --> 28:49.102
Yeah. Come on.

28:49.103 --> 28:51.230
[people murmuring]

28:58.320 --> 28:59.279
That poor girl.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.197
Nicky's gonna be all right.

29:01.198 --> 29:04.033
No. I'm not talking
about Nicky.

29:04.034 --> 29:07.203
I'm talking about Fatima.

29:07.204 --> 29:09.290
That horrible bird.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.295
What if it was a sign?

29:21.177 --> 29:22.178
What's wrong?

29:25.139 --> 29:26.098
Am I awake?

29:35.357 --> 29:37.985
Where are you going?

29:53.375 --> 29:55.085
Help me.

29:57.213 --> 30:00.048
- Please!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

30:00.049 --> 30:03.052
[chattering in distance]

30:08.265 --> 30:10.141
Can you see anything?

30:10.142 --> 30:12.060
No.

30:12.061 --> 30:15.189
What if they
don't come back?

30:16.315 --> 30:18.191
Don't think like that.

30:18.192 --> 30:22.153
They'll come back.

30:22.154 --> 30:27.158
Julie,
what happened to you?

30:27.159 --> 30:31.038
What do you mean?

30:31.497 --> 30:35.291
Ever since you fell asleep
and your eyes got all white,

30:35.292 --> 30:37.210
you've been different.

30:37.211 --> 30:40.047
Are you sure you're okay?

30:44.426 --> 30:47.179
Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.183
I don't believe you.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.351
You know I'm not
a baby anymore.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.395
You can tell me things.

31:00.317 --> 31:02.319
You wanna know
the truth?

31:06.156 --> 31:08.075
I'm really scared.

31:11.161 --> 31:14.372
I saw things that I
don't really understand.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.334
There's things that
I can't even remember.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.378
All I remember
is being more scared

31:20.379 --> 31:22.381
than I've ever been
in my entire life.

31:25.301 --> 31:27.219
And that's the truth.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.140
I haven't told
anybody but you.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.268
I'm trying really hard
to be okay.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.186
Can I help?

31:37.187 --> 31:41.232
[chuckles] Hey,
I'm the big sister here.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.319
I'm the one who
takes care of you.

31:43.694 --> 31:50.074
If they don't come back,
it'll just be us.

31:50.075 --> 31:52.411
We have to start taking care
of each other from now on.

32:01.337 --> 32:04.130
They'll come back.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.174
So, the rod was
through his eye?

32:06.175 --> 32:10.136
Mm. Well, only when
he was on the tree.

32:10.137 --> 32:13.431
When he walked up to me
with a skull full of blood,

32:13.432 --> 32:17.226
it was just a--
a bloody, empty socket.

32:17.227 --> 32:18.603
- Jesus.
- [Jade sighing]

32:18.604 --> 32:21.314
Yeah. So, that's what
my life's been like lately.

32:21.315 --> 32:25.193
How long has this been
going on for?

32:25.194 --> 32:27.195
The hallucinating?

32:27.196 --> 32:30.239
Pretty much
since I got here.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.200
Do you remember that day I took
you down to the root cellar,

32:32.201 --> 32:33.451
told you I saw that
symbol up on the ceiling?

32:33.452 --> 32:35.453
You thought
I was crazy?

32:35.454 --> 32:37.331
[sighing]

32:42.336 --> 32:45.506
Tian-Chen saw me
in the diner.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.385
I was drawing the symbol over
and over again, losing my mind,

32:50.386 --> 32:53.304
and first,
she made me tea.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.473
And then she took me back
into the storage room,

32:55.474 --> 32:59.143
and she, uh...

32:59.144 --> 33:00.354
she pulled out this.

33:03.357 --> 33:05.401
Still have no idea
how she knew it was there.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.489
My mom knew every inch
of that storage room.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.324
[chuckling]

33:13.325 --> 33:15.201
You know, I thought
I was smart enough

33:15.202 --> 33:16.495
to figure
this place out, and...

33:19.248 --> 33:21.374
I should have...

33:21.375 --> 33:22.376
Fuck.

33:24.503 --> 33:28.298
She really liked you,
you know? My mom.

33:30.634 --> 33:33.261
I think she tolerated me
more than anything.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.348
[Kenny] No, no, no.
I mean, she really, uh...

33:38.600 --> 33:41.477
She only frowned
at people that she liked.

33:41.478 --> 33:45.565
I mean, the people that
she didn't, she just... ignored.

33:45.566 --> 33:47.401
[chuckles]

33:52.531 --> 33:53.574
[Kristi grunting] Ow.

33:56.452 --> 34:00.329
When you finish that letter,

34:00.330 --> 34:01.498
tell her we all say hi.

34:07.296 --> 34:11.299
[thudding]

34:11.300 --> 34:12.467
- Jesus.
- [whispering] Shh.

34:12.468 --> 34:14.510
It's okay. It's okay.
Shh, shh, shh.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.262
[creaking]

34:16.263 --> 34:18.306
Are you sure those things
you saw today

34:18.307 --> 34:19.391
were hallucinations?

34:43.373 --> 34:46.376
Uh, this belonged
to Mr. Gerber.

34:48.504 --> 34:52.298
He always smelled
like onions.

34:52.299 --> 34:53.466
They grow wild
in the woods,

34:53.467 --> 34:55.636
so he would pick them
and eat them raw.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.474
[sniffs]

35:10.692 --> 35:12.569
- [rattling]
- Hmm.

35:22.579 --> 35:26.667
Oh. This was from Delores.

35:31.713 --> 35:34.424
She always cried lots.

35:37.511 --> 35:38.470
Mm.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.433
Mm.

35:46.436 --> 35:47.521
- [grunting]
- What's wrong?

35:49.773 --> 35:51.691
Nothing for Christopher.

35:51.692 --> 35:53.610
Who was Christopher?

35:58.657 --> 35:59.615
He was our friend.

35:59.616 --> 36:01.701
He-- he was nice,

36:01.702 --> 36:03.578
but then he started
seeing the symbol,

36:03.579 --> 36:07.708
and then he started
getting scary.

36:11.795 --> 36:13.589
What?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.550
[grunting]

36:17.092 --> 36:19.510
No. This was a mistake. I don't
want to do this anymore.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.429
- Victor.
- No! I said no!

36:21.430 --> 36:23.514
- Victor!
- I said no!

36:23.515 --> 36:26.475
- Victor!
- No, no, no, no!

36:26.476 --> 36:27.560
- Victor!
- No, no!

36:27.561 --> 36:29.353
- Victor! Victor!
- No, no!

36:29.354 --> 36:30.646
- Hey, hey.
- [moaning]

36:30.647 --> 36:34.443
Shh. It's okay.

36:35.694 --> 36:37.571
You don't have to
be afraid.

36:40.574 --> 36:42.618
I'm the scariest person
in town, remember?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.749
I know what's missing.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.711
[Christopher in high voice]
Hello, Victor!

36:53.795 --> 36:56.548
His name was Jasper.

36:57.799 --> 36:58.759
I, uh...

37:01.637 --> 37:02.596
I left him.

37:04.598 --> 37:05.557
I just...

37:06.767 --> 37:08.392
I just fucking left.

37:08.393 --> 37:09.810
Oh, my God, Boyd.
