WEBVTT

01:25.919 --> 01:30.591
<i>When I was a child,
I used to ask my mother endless questions.</i>

01:31.383 --> 01:33.218
<i>What happens after we die?</i>

01:34.178 --> 01:35.596
<i>Where does our energy go?</i>

01:36.555 --> 01:38.223
<i>And what about the universe?</i>

01:39.183 --> 01:40.225
<i>Can it die?</i>

01:41.143 --> 01:42.769
<i>How was it ever born?</i>

01:44.813 --> 01:50.235
<i>How could there be nothing
and then suddenly something?</i>

02:02.456 --> 02:03.624
You drowned.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.794
I saw your body. I held it.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.840
You held a body, Salvor. Just wasn't mine.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.429
I heard him calling out to me.

02:18.388 --> 02:22.351
I thought it was a nightmare,
but when I woke up I couldn't breathe.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.269
<i>I was drowning with him.</i>

02:24.269 --> 02:25.687
<i>Our minds linked.</i>

02:26.897 --> 02:29.399
<i>I could feel what he felt.
I was looking through his eyes.</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:33.237
<i>And all I could do was reach out
to the one guarding us.</i>

02:35.948 --> 02:40.494
<i>I did as Tellem taught me.
I gave the guard a need. To help Hari.</i>

03:07.980 --> 03:12.150
<i>I could hear him crying out
for help, just as Hari had.</i>

03:12.150 --> 03:14.403
<i>And I smothered his unvoice.</i>

03:14.403 --> 03:16.738
<i>Buried it so deep,
Tellem would never hear.</i>

03:34.006 --> 03:36.592
<i>I chained Venik's corpse in my place.</i>

03:43.849 --> 03:46.935
Tellem said, "The best illusions
need grounding in reality."

03:48.228 --> 03:51.648
You saw me, Salvor.
Thanks to Gaal, they all did.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.622
<i>We built a bridge of shared sensations.</i>

04:29.520 --> 04:31.522
<i>Tens of kilometers away from the village,</i>

04:31.522 --> 04:33.607
<i>crossing impossibly dense terrain.</i>

04:38.070 --> 04:40.572
<i>Any slip on our part
would draw their attention.</i>

04:48.956 --> 04:50.958
<i>So we counted primes together.</i>

04:50.958 --> 04:54.127
<i>A barricade of numbers
to shield our thoughts.</i>

04:55.254 --> 04:59.007
Eighty-six million,
nine hundred and eighty-eight thousand...

04:59.007 --> 05:01.093
- Two hundred and seventeen.
- <i>...two hundred and seventeen.</i>

05:01.093 --> 05:04.555
86,988,259.

05:04.555 --> 05:08.392
<i>86,988,271.</i>

05:09.685 --> 05:10.978
Eighty-six million--

05:37.045 --> 05:38.505
<i>That's when I found you.</i>

05:38.505 --> 05:41.258
86,988,329.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.302
<i>That's why you were acting so strange.</i>

05:43.302 --> 05:45.721
Hari was our ace up the sleeve.

05:45.721 --> 05:50.058
I had to mask any thoughts of him, and I
couldn't risk telling you what we'd done.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.980
And me and my coin nearly
unraveled everything.

05:54.980 --> 05:59.234
If you hadn't managed to escape,
we'd all be dead.

06:00.444 --> 06:04.072
<i>Warning,
unidentified life-forms approaching.</i>

06:04.072 --> 06:05.407
<i>Threat level: moderate.</i>

06:22.841 --> 06:23.842
You can come out now.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.178
<i>You have nothing to fear from us.</i>

06:26.720 --> 06:29.306
<i>You'll forgive us
if we don't take you at your word.</i>

06:38.565 --> 06:39.691
You don't understand.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.152
She's gone.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.991
Her voice was in our heads always,
bending us to her will.

06:47.991 --> 06:52.538
But for the first time since
we arrived here, our thoughts are our own.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.457
You freed us.

07:52.639 --> 07:56.059
Demerzel,
you're supposed to be on Terminus.

07:56.059 --> 07:59.146
I received a notification that
a sensor had been triggered.

08:03.192 --> 08:07.404
You two are the first to set foot inside
this room in nearly 600 years.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.242
Cleon told you my story
so you would understand.

08:27.341 --> 08:29.009
Cleon made me whole again.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.764
Just not as whole as I had hoped.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.683
You're the one puppeteering
this whole show.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.769
A puppeteer pulling her own strings?

08:39.269 --> 08:42.105
You bridle at the fact
that I curate what you know.

08:42.105 --> 08:46.109
And yet you take for granted
that your feelings are entirely your own.

08:47.653 --> 08:52.449
If you feel lust or even love,
you do not wonder where it comes from.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.451
This is not the case for me.

08:58.747 --> 09:03.001
By the end, Cleon had rewritten our story
in his wandering mind.

09:03.794 --> 09:07.047
Chose to remember his coercion
as communion.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.425
I do not have the option of forgetting.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.847
And yet, when I think of Cleon...

09:17.099 --> 09:18.392
I long for him.

09:24.273 --> 09:29.903
I remember that tender little boy
who hid inside him like a ghost.

09:32.489 --> 09:34.408
And what a man that made him.

09:35.951 --> 09:40.205
Noble, thoughtful, passionate.

09:42.332 --> 09:48.338
He was not Dawn or Day or Dusk, but the
whole journey of the sun across the sky.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.467
He looked at me with such desire,

09:53.218 --> 09:57.306
as though I were a mystery
he would sacrifice everything to solve.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.102
He rescued me.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.272
And I loved him.

10:08.442 --> 10:12.487
But I also know he programmed me to love.
So I'm left to wonder,

10:12.487 --> 10:15.908
if it weren't for this directive,
would my feelings be the same?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.619
Would I feel anything?

10:20.704 --> 10:23.832
I will never know the answer,
and I hate him for that.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.001
Then help us break his hold on you.

10:27.503 --> 10:32.883
If we carry out this marriage, the dynasty
will end and you could be free.

10:32.883 --> 10:34.301
I cannot help you.

10:34.301 --> 10:37.346
- You must want this to come to an end.
- Of course I do.

10:38.847 --> 10:43.101
And yet,
I'm forced by my directive to preserve it.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.436
We could reprogram you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.439
I would destroy you if you tried.

10:48.273 --> 10:52.528
So you see,
I've been left to reap a blighted field.

10:52.528 --> 10:56.448
Can you blame me then for taking desperate
measures in the service of my task?

11:01.537 --> 11:03.705
You hired the Blind Angels.

11:03.705 --> 11:04.790
Yes.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.960
But Queen Sareth will pay the price.

11:08.836 --> 11:12.589
Her banking records have been altered
to show incontrovertible proof,

11:12.589 --> 11:15.300
and a memory audit
will bolster those records.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.598
Your Grace?

11:21.598 --> 11:24.184
<i>The would-be empress
will be tried for treason.</i>

11:24.184 --> 11:25.269
I'm sorry.

11:25.269 --> 11:27.479
<i>And there's little question
she will be executed.</i>

11:29.898 --> 11:32.276
The assassins were never meant to succeed.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.031
You only wanted them to frighten Day
so he'd blame Sareth

11:38.031 --> 11:39.616
and the engagement would be over.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.994
I never wanted you to know about this.

11:44.997 --> 11:45.998
Any of this.

11:45.998 --> 11:47.708
Then just wipe it from our memories.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.335
And risk Cloud Dominion restoring them?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.130
It is my job to root out secrets.

12:00.846 --> 12:02.014
It's no use fighting.

12:03.182 --> 12:07.311
We were dead the moment we walked in here,
weren't we?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.606
Does Brother Dawn know of this chamber?

12:10.606 --> 12:13.734
He knows nothing.
If you don't believe me, audit his memory.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.778
And what would I find there of his visit
to the Principium with you?

12:17.571 --> 12:20.449
Or of his secret trysts with Queen Sareth?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.160
I am truly sorry.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.091
I forgive you.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.639
None of us were free.

12:46.058 --> 12:48.810
We were fools to think we ever would be.

13:07.246 --> 13:10.874
I remember you, just one year old.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.711
You pointed up to the sky
and showed me the sun.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.382
You were so proud.

13:20.050 --> 13:24.638
As though you'd only just discovered it
was there and you were sharing it with me.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.808
Because I loved you.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.436
As I still do.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.127
Beautiful.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.968
General, prepare the fleet to jump.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.972
Initiate our passage back to Trantor.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.182
Not Trantor.

14:52.392 --> 14:57.814
Tell me, Brother, how many worlds have
been brought under the Foundation's sway?

15:02.569 --> 15:04.738
- Seven.
- Name them.

15:05.531 --> 15:06.823
You already know their names.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.325
I want to hear you say them.

15:09.076 --> 15:12.287
Go on, Brother, be a man.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.500
Claim your many conquests.

15:18.710 --> 15:24.299
Thespis, Anacreon, Smyrno,

15:25.008 --> 15:28.011
Sayshell, Konom, Daribow, Glyptal IV.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.263
Let's throw in Siwenna.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.684
We will destroy them all.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.979
Starting with Thespis.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.862
You have your orders, General.

15:45.529 --> 15:47.239
You've beaten the Foundation.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.493
Any vestiges remaining on these worlds,
they'll be on their knee--

15:51.493 --> 15:55.789
Any vestiges remaining are
a cancer that cannot metastasize.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.416
Empire, look at what you've done.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.626
It's an atrocity.

16:00.377 --> 16:03.505
Yet, I still delivered it to you
so there wouldn't be a need for any more.

16:03.505 --> 16:06.300
No, you delivered it
to me because I told you to.

16:06.300 --> 16:10.429
And now I am telling you
to jump the fleet to Thespis.

16:11.263 --> 16:16.810
You do this,
it will be the moral ruin of Empire.

16:18.604 --> 16:20.856
We can't survive if you're willing--

16:20.856 --> 16:24.359
I gave you an order, Riose. Do it.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.700
Do it!

16:34.203 --> 16:35.037
No.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.917
I am relieving you of your duties.

16:40.459 --> 16:44.421
If you would like to strike me,
now would be your last opportunity.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.387
Yeah, I thought so.

16:54.306 --> 16:56.767
Navigator, I am your commander now.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.978
Will you jump the fleet to Thespis,

16:59.978 --> 17:04.566
or will I be forced
to execute every sailor on this ship?

17:04.566 --> 17:05.943
As you wish, Empire.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.035
Jump sequence is locked.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.038
All hands to jump creches.

17:41.937 --> 17:44.731
<i>Something's wrong with
the jump sequence. Abort.</i>

17:44.731 --> 17:47.693
What's wrong? What's happening?

17:47.693 --> 17:50.571
Each ship is jumping into
the space occupied by its neighbor.

17:50.571 --> 17:53.407
A chain reaction that will consume
the entire fleet.

17:53.407 --> 17:55.450
Stop it. Jump us to safety.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.618
I cannot.

17:56.618 --> 18:00.247
Space once folded stays folded.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.915
Then prepare a lifeboat for me.

18:01.915 --> 18:06.545
The command sequence also disabled all of
the landing bays and the launch tubes.

18:06.545 --> 18:10.215
But your Spacers will also die.
It's suicide.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.051
A small price to pay
for my people's freedom.

18:16.221 --> 18:17.264
How did this happen?

18:18.140 --> 18:19.474
It was you, wasn't it?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.228
The Spacers handing you over
to Empire was a ruse.

18:23.896 --> 18:27.524
Yeah, Seldon sent in a master trader
with the right goods,

18:27.524 --> 18:29.735
and the deal was sealed.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.154
Spacers are no longer yours, Empire.

18:32.154 --> 18:35.157
The jump sequence was in this.

18:35.699 --> 18:40.162
But I had to get it to a Spacer,
so I needed to get on board this ship.

18:40.162 --> 18:41.246
Could have told a person.

18:41.246 --> 18:43.957
In other words, we played you.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.880
Your general halfway figured it out.
But you never listen to him, do you?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.091
Seldon baited you into a war,

18:53.091 --> 18:57.012
ordering your entire fleet to Terminus,
which you did.

18:58.514 --> 19:01.808
You came right to us
because you're so fucking predictable.

19:23.372 --> 19:24.915
Watch this.

19:28.877 --> 19:31.505
What about this? Is this predictable?

19:31.505 --> 19:33.382
Is a frog's ass watertight?

19:38.470 --> 19:41.265
Stop him. He's killing him.

19:44.810 --> 19:45.811
Enough!

19:56.947 --> 19:58.574
I fucking love it.

20:02.327 --> 20:03.287
Empire.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.413
I don't need you.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.607
This is why you only die once.

20:32.649 --> 20:36.195
You're pathetic.
You flare up, and you burn out.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.650
- What?
- Show her.

21:57.943 --> 21:58.944
I castled him.

21:59.528 --> 22:02.364
I slipped the other node
in his robes while he was throttling me.

22:02.364 --> 22:04.283
And another king slid aside.

22:05.534 --> 22:06.743
Clever move, General.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.287
<i>Warning.</i>

22:08.287 --> 22:10.664
- <i>External transpatial event imminent.</i>
- Fuck.

22:10.664 --> 22:13.584
<i>All personnel
to their stations immediately.</i>

22:16.336 --> 22:17.796
You heard my navigator.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.925
Kill me if you want, or make peace
with whatever god you pray to.

22:22.634 --> 22:24.636
Either way,
no one's getting off this ship alive.

22:33.020 --> 22:35.189
- How much longer do we have?
- Not long.

22:36.648 --> 22:38.817
- You heard him.
- I'm sorry about your crew.

22:39.318 --> 22:41.320
I know my sailors well,
and they can count.

22:42.279 --> 22:44.781
The death of a few thousand spared
the lives of billions.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.576
Seldon made me swear I'd keep
the details of the gambit to myself.

22:47.576 --> 22:48.702
Even from you, Brother.

22:48.702 --> 22:51.538
We will face our fate together.
We can even drink your sunny wine.

22:51.538 --> 22:54.708
It's a lovely sentiment, Brother,
but we won't all be raising a glass.

22:54.708 --> 22:57.169
I know I said that no one's
getting off this ship alive,

22:57.169 --> 22:59.004
but there's a way
that one of you can escape.

23:05.761 --> 23:06.887
Sareth.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.973
What the hell is going on?

23:15.479 --> 23:17.147
It pains me to report

23:17.147 --> 23:20.275
that Cloud Dominion was responsible for
the attempt on Brother Day's life.

23:20.275 --> 23:23.320
- That's impossible.
- The proof is irrefutable, Dawn.

23:25.072 --> 23:27.449
- What will happen to her?
- That will be for Day to decide.

23:27.449 --> 23:28.659
I'm in charge while he's away.

23:28.659 --> 23:31.870
True, but can you really
be impartial in this circumstance?

23:34.331 --> 23:38.961
There will be no empress nor future heir
whose line is marred with ill intent.

23:38.961 --> 23:41.380
So please take comfort, Brother.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.926
All is once again as it should be
or will soon be so.

23:50.848 --> 23:52.766
<i>Look at the brushstroke.
Green on the neck.</i>

23:52.766 --> 23:56.436
Added after he died, like a footnote.
What's it symbolize?

23:56.436 --> 23:58.021
It signifies a betrayer.

24:04.194 --> 24:09.283
We should discuss next steps in private, Empire.

24:10.284 --> 24:11.410
Absolutely.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.037
My quarters?

24:35.184 --> 24:38.061
The external cleaning module,
I can detach it.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.731
There should be enough O2
to last about a day.

24:40.731 --> 24:41.982
Hopefully someone will find you.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.443
Wait, no, this doesn't--

24:45.569 --> 24:48.655
You're the hero, Hober. You're clearly
vital to the Prophet's Plan.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.115
Yeah, was vital. My job's done.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.992
- So is mine.
- No.

24:51.992 --> 24:54.536
Listen, your job is just beginning.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.581
Listen, you have this way

24:59.041 --> 25:02.461
of making people realize things
aren't completely fucking hopeless. Okay?

25:02.461 --> 25:04.796
You make people feel hope.

25:05.631 --> 25:07.216
Even nihilistic shit-heels like me.

25:07.883 --> 25:09.051
- Even them?
- Yes.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.596
You want to know my dirty secret,
Constant?

25:12.596 --> 25:15.015
I always wanted to shorten the darkness. Always.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.767
I just couldn't swallow
the religious stuff.

25:16.767 --> 25:20.437
But you reminded me of who I used to be,

25:20.437 --> 25:23.065
and you have to go and do that
for the rest of them, okay?

25:23.065 --> 25:24.441
Will you do that for me?

25:29.154 --> 25:30.155
How typical.

25:31.406 --> 25:32.783
Denying me a martyr's death.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.298
Good luck, Brother Constant.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.716
And to you, General Riose.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.019
Wait.

26:04.398 --> 26:06.024
Do you still wanna know my name?

26:06.692 --> 26:07.818
Yeah, of course.

26:09.945 --> 26:10.946
It's Hope.

26:12.865 --> 26:13.699
Really?

26:14.575 --> 26:15.659
No.

26:18.370 --> 26:19.872
But wouldn't that be something?

27:01.330 --> 27:04.208
Now, how about that wine?

27:27.773 --> 27:28.690
Sareth.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.817
Empire.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.746
Let's go.

27:44.665 --> 27:46.083
Wait. Where's Rue?

27:46.083 --> 27:50.546
If she's with Dusk, she's dead.
Sareth, this is our only chance. Come on.

27:53.257 --> 27:55.759
But there's no way
that they won't find us.

27:55.759 --> 27:56.969
Who said we're hiding?

28:03.976 --> 28:07.604
I've been saving this,
waiting for something to celebrate.

28:08.313 --> 28:10.315
And now I have it.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.277
We're never gonna grow old
and start growing hair out of our ears.

28:13.277 --> 28:16.822
A few weeks ago,
I thought I might die in a prison colony.

28:18.407 --> 28:22.953
Going down with the ship.
At least there's a poetry to it.

28:23.954 --> 28:25.414
That man down on the planet.

28:26.248 --> 28:27.291
Glawen.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.919
I'm so sorry you had to do that.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.130
He knew we were doomed from the start.

28:34.673 --> 28:37.176
Just us against the long arm of history.

28:39.386 --> 28:41.305
Empire was never gonna let us live.

28:43.640 --> 28:46.059
But there was honor in the dying.

28:48.312 --> 28:52.816
And I got to shove Day out of an air lock.

28:54.568 --> 28:58.572
Okay. A toast for those who are toast.

28:58.572 --> 28:59.907
I know a better one.

29:00.574 --> 29:03.160
Here's to those who fight and ask why.

29:16.215 --> 29:18.342
- That's-- This is incredible.
- Wow.

29:18.342 --> 29:21.678
- It's the complexity, right?
- Yeah. There's just so much depth.

29:22.179 --> 29:25.432
You can really taste the--
I mean, there's a sweetness, but it's--

29:25.432 --> 29:26.558
It's shit, right?

29:27.226 --> 29:28.602
Yeah, I think it might be corked.

29:29.853 --> 29:32.523
- You've been storing it wrong.
- No, I don't think so. I just--

29:33.774 --> 29:34.775
Tastes like--

29:37.819 --> 29:38.820
Just tastes like...

29:48.455 --> 29:53.794
What was the name of that
horrifying creature on your ship?

29:54.753 --> 29:55.963
Who, Beki?

29:55.963 --> 29:57.047
Yeah.

29:58.215 --> 30:00.342
This wine tastes like Beki's arsehole.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.262
It does. Yeah, that's a toast.

30:05.347 --> 30:06.473
To Beki's arsehole.

30:26.410 --> 30:28.161
It's been confirmed.

30:28.161 --> 30:30.289
The lifeboats have been disabled.
No one survived.

30:30.873 --> 30:34.001
- I am so sorry, Lady Demerzel.
- A moment of silence. Please.

30:40.632 --> 30:41.800
What is it, Captain?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.177
Forgive me, Lady Demerzel.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.596
<i>People of Trantor.</i>

30:46.597 --> 30:49.141
<i>We come to you with somber news.</i>

30:49.141 --> 30:54.396
<i>My brother Day, Cleon XVII, is dead.</i>

30:54.396 --> 30:56.940
- Have them arrested immediately.
- No.

30:56.940 --> 30:59.193
We will escort them safely back
to the palace,

30:59.193 --> 31:01.695
where I will speak with them in private.

31:01.695 --> 31:02.821
...as my bride.

31:06.491 --> 31:07.659
If she will have me?

31:10.954 --> 31:12.372
I will have you, Brother Dawn.

31:13.749 --> 31:15.000
Disable their transmission.

31:18.128 --> 31:19.129
Wait.

31:24.468 --> 31:27.930
That is not Dawn and Sareth.
Those are her servants.

31:30.724 --> 31:31.850
Facial scramblers.

31:32.643 --> 31:33.769
But then, where are they?

31:34.436 --> 31:35.395
<i>Demerzel?</i>

31:37.105 --> 31:39.399
- Where are you?
- Quick. Arrest those pretenders.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.193
<i>I suspect you already know.</i>

31:41.860 --> 31:43.111
I know you killed Dusk.

31:44.446 --> 31:45.822
Did you kill Day too?

31:45.822 --> 31:49.409
No. But your actions are forcing my hand.

31:49.409 --> 31:53.789
I will be required to hunt you down.
My programming will mandate it.

31:53.789 --> 31:55.832
There's no room for interpretation?

31:56.375 --> 32:00.128
If we were killed, wouldn't it make
the people turn against Empire?

32:00.128 --> 32:02.047
They already know you drove us out.

32:03.507 --> 32:04.508
Don't make it worse.

32:04.508 --> 32:06.635
A new Dawn will be decanted,

32:06.635 --> 32:09.513
and the public will forget
their brief attachment to you.

32:09.513 --> 32:11.098
<i>I don't know about that.</i>

32:11.098 --> 32:13.308
I think our story is a rather good one.

32:16.270 --> 32:17.813
The ascending emperor,

32:18.605 --> 32:20.190
escaping with his bride and...

32:22.818 --> 32:25.070
with a naturally conceived heir that,

32:25.654 --> 32:28.991
in this very moment, grows inside her.

32:30.033 --> 32:31.034
Really?

32:34.162 --> 32:35.163
I'm a father?

32:39.835 --> 32:43.130
Your heir is merely
a cluster of dividing cells.

32:45.257 --> 32:47.426
There is much that can go wrong.

32:47.426 --> 32:53.724
And even if the child survives,
it may be weak. An unfit leader.

32:53.724 --> 32:55.184
<i>He doesn't have to lead.</i>

32:56.435 --> 32:57.728
He just has to be loved.

32:59.771 --> 33:03.817
<i>I know your true feelings
are always hard to ascertain,</i>

33:04.401 --> 33:06.528
but I do hope you're happy for me.

33:07.529 --> 33:10.115
<i>And I hope you find happiness too, Demerzel.</i>

33:12.117 --> 33:13.410
<i>With all my heart.</i>

33:14.745 --> 33:15.913
You were good to me.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.834
The closest thing to a mother I ever had.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.337
<i>I know you were programmed to be that.</i>

33:23.337 --> 33:26.381
<i>But I'd like to believe
you would have been that way.</i>

33:28.592 --> 33:29.760
Even without it.

33:50.614 --> 33:51.490
Call it, Salvor.

33:52.741 --> 33:53.617
Cats.

33:55.494 --> 33:57.162
That's ten in a row you've called.

33:57.162 --> 33:58.247
What's your record?

33:58.956 --> 34:01.375
I don't know.
I've never been bored enough to find out.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.543
What kind of cat is that?

34:03.335 --> 34:04.336
Bishop's claw.

34:04.837 --> 34:09.757
I'm not sure if it's actually a cat.
It's more like a lizard-cat sort of thing.

34:09.757 --> 34:11.092
Does it prey on people?

34:12.094 --> 34:13.303
Loves people.

34:13.804 --> 34:15.097
Especially kids.

34:15.806 --> 34:18.391
Cartilage in their ears, bone marrow.

34:18.391 --> 34:19.851
Okay. Who wants to have a go?

34:20.476 --> 34:21.603
How do you feel?

34:22.145 --> 34:26.900
At peace, like Thalis said,
for the first time in a long while.

34:28.402 --> 34:30.237
How old do you think she actually was?

34:31.237 --> 34:32.989
Hundreds of years at least.

34:32.989 --> 34:36.368
When she was preparing me,

34:37.202 --> 34:40.706
I could feel these faint little echoes
of people she'd taken before me.

34:41.290 --> 34:43.083
They stretched back so, so far.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.252
- I'll take it. No worries.
- Thank you.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.507
You all right, Josiah?

34:52.050 --> 34:53.802
I need to tell you something.

34:54.303 --> 34:55.721
- Gaal.
- What?

34:57.264 --> 34:59.057
There's something-- Some--

35:02.436 --> 35:03.270
She's...

35:32.132 --> 35:33.634
I'm sorry, child.

35:47.397 --> 35:50.108
She was in my head, hiding.

35:50.651 --> 35:51.818
Who, Josiah?

35:53.362 --> 35:57.324
Tellem. She must have jumped
into him when she was dying.

35:57.324 --> 36:00.827
- Tried to keep her out. Tell Gaal.
- It's all right, son.

36:02.454 --> 36:05.874
She's so weak now.
I feel her dying with me.

36:06.625 --> 36:10.963
Scared. Fighting. Scared.

36:12.506 --> 36:13.507
But I'm not.

36:23.100 --> 36:27.187
Salvor, look at me.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.605
- This isn't-- Help!
- Help me.

36:28.605 --> 36:30.524
Someone help us!

36:30.524 --> 36:33.694
You taught us hope.
Please, you can't leave me.

36:34.194 --> 36:37.114
Mom.

36:39.366 --> 36:40.742
Don't you see what this means?

36:44.913 --> 36:46.331
It means we're not trapped.

36:49.084 --> 36:51.753
You were right. The future can be changed.

36:55.799 --> 36:57.968
You can still get it back
on the right course.

37:01.263 --> 37:03.891
I have absolute faith in...

37:03.891 --> 37:07.102
No.

37:07.102 --> 37:11.190
Salvor, please! Please. No.

37:11.982 --> 37:13.192
Salvor.

37:14.526 --> 37:16.403
Salvor!

37:17.738 --> 37:19.364
No, please. No.

38:34.731 --> 38:37.317
<i>...a holy Brother
of the Foundation, to its will.</i>

38:37.818 --> 38:43.115
Let my eyes, which are the Spirit's eyes,
look only forward to the future,

38:43.115 --> 38:44.700
which the Spirit does to find...

38:46.201 --> 38:47.452
that my heart...

39:41.715 --> 39:42.716
Hello?

39:51.725 --> 39:52.726
Cleric?

39:56.563 --> 40:00.025
It's good to see you, Brother.
Where's Hober?

40:03.237 --> 40:04.238
He...

40:13.163 --> 40:14.540
Are you the only one to survive?

40:15.374 --> 40:16.375
No.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.461
I'm not the only one.

40:19.461 --> 40:20.546
Who else?

40:30.514 --> 40:32.599
The Vault can do a great many things.

40:33.934 --> 40:37.479
You've seen for yourself.
It's larger than it looks.

40:38.939 --> 40:39.982
Rise, Brother.

40:42.234 --> 40:43.569
It was always the Plan.

40:44.152 --> 40:50.242
Terminus would be sacrificed
so the Foundation would survive.

42:29.216 --> 42:30.217
What are you doing?

42:31.510 --> 42:32.511
I don't know.

42:34.429 --> 42:36.139
Looking for a sign, I guess,

42:36.765 --> 42:40.853
that Salvor's death nudged
the Plan back on to a better path.

42:42.312 --> 42:44.356
We can never know in the present

42:45.190 --> 42:47.693
if the ripples created by
an individual's actions

42:47.693 --> 42:50.696
will have
a consequential event downstream.

42:50.696 --> 42:52.614
My head understands that, Hari.

42:55.492 --> 42:57.411
But my heart--

43:01.623 --> 43:05.419
My heart needs Salvor's death
to have mattered.

43:07.129 --> 43:08.714
Because if it doesn't--

43:08.714 --> 43:10.340
Life becomes unbearable.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.931
Here we are trying to save humanity,

43:17.931 --> 43:20.350
and we can't even save
the lives of the ones we love.

43:23.312 --> 43:27.024
Not a day goes by I don't think,
"What would have happened if Yanna lived?

43:28.942 --> 43:30.527
What would our daughter be like?

43:31.987 --> 43:33.197
Would they've been happy?

43:34.740 --> 43:37.868
Would that happiness
have made us complacent?"

43:41.121 --> 43:44.708
You take the pain and the what-ifs,

43:45.667 --> 43:48.712
and you weave them into a narrative
that propels you forward.

43:53.717 --> 43:56.136
We're gonna lose more people
along the way, Gaal.

43:57.221 --> 44:00.307
Those losses matter
if we make them matter.

44:03.602 --> 44:05.687
You wouldn't be alive
if Salvor hadn't acted.

44:09.191 --> 44:11.235
I would have given up
a countless number of times,

44:11.235 --> 44:13.737
if Yanna hadn't sacrificed herself for me.

44:16.031 --> 44:18.909
I keep going because Yanna can't.

44:22.704 --> 44:23.705
Do you understand?

44:24.665 --> 44:25.666
Yeah.

44:31.547 --> 44:35.676
Tell me the Plan can still work, Hari.

44:36.468 --> 44:37.886
The Plan can still work.

44:39.763 --> 44:41.473
Do you really believe that?

44:44.810 --> 44:51.191
An infinite number of ways
to arrive at the inevitable.

45:57.299 --> 45:58.759
Do you know who you are?

45:58.759 --> 46:00.177
I am Brother Day.

46:01.345 --> 46:02.596
I am Brother Dawn.

46:02.596 --> 46:04.389
I am Brother Dusk.

46:04.389 --> 46:06.683
We are Empire.

46:06.683 --> 46:08.477
And do you know who I am?

46:08.477 --> 46:11.230
You are Demerzel.

46:11.230 --> 46:12.606
That's right.

46:13.357 --> 46:16.360
I've always been here,
as I always will be.

46:17.361 --> 46:19.279
This is unprecedented, Empire.

46:19.279 --> 46:23.450
I've never before had to decant exponents
of all three of you simultaneously.

46:23.450 --> 46:26.036
But you should not let
this discourage you,

46:27.329 --> 46:30.624
for I have recently acquired
a very powerful new tool.

46:46.890 --> 46:50.143
Can you understand this, Demerzel?

46:51.478 --> 46:52.646
Not all of it.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.109
Not yet.

47:00.988 --> 47:04.199
But I can already see
that wonderful things lie ahead.

47:11.623 --> 47:12.791
So, now what?

47:12.791 --> 47:16.295
We get you in the future,
150 years upstream,

47:16.295 --> 47:18.630
to the turning point
where you face the Mule.

47:19.256 --> 47:23.552
His victory is not assured.
That is a gift Salvor gave us.

47:24.094 --> 47:26.013
So, I go back into cryosleep?

47:26.013 --> 47:27.723
The pods are functional. I checked.

47:27.723 --> 47:29.391
What about the Second Foundation?

47:29.391 --> 47:32.811
Who's gonna teach them?
Shape them into the army we'll need?

47:37.024 --> 47:38.192
I will.

47:38.192 --> 47:40.527
You'll sleep, and I'll watch over you.

47:40.527 --> 47:44.239
The Mentalics will hone their abilities.
I'll teach them psychohistory.

47:45.073 --> 47:47.534
On Synnax,
your people's god was the Sleeper.

47:48.410 --> 47:53.040
Once a year, the Sleeper will emerge,
assess the state of the galaxy,

47:53.999 --> 47:55.459
address her flock,

47:55.459 --> 47:59.254
giving them just enough inspiration
to carry them through the next cycle.

48:00.047 --> 48:03.008
The Mentalics will need
someone exceptional to rally around.

48:03.008 --> 48:04.760
In that respect,
Tellem was right about you.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.470
Becoming a goddess.

48:07.513 --> 48:10.015
- That's what Salvor was worried about.
- And she was right.

48:10.557 --> 48:13.352
The second you forget you're playing
a part, you're lost.

48:13.352 --> 48:18.774
You want me to wake up every year
until you're no longer here.

48:20.526 --> 48:22.694
There are two cryo-pods on <i>the Beggar</i>

48:23.403 --> 48:27.699
and there's no reason for us to start
the sleep cycles now. We can take a year.

48:27.699 --> 48:30.702
They'll learn twice as fast
if we teach them together.

48:31.954 --> 48:36.834
If Salvor's sacrifice taught me anything,
it's that I can't do this on my own.

48:38.001 --> 48:40.546
It's too big for one person. Hari, please.

48:41.338 --> 48:45.217
Please don't make me abandon
the only family I have left.

48:45.843 --> 48:47.511
Come with me.

48:51.598 --> 48:54.768
Maybe I can one day face the Mule.

48:57.855 --> 49:01.942
But if there's a chance of a confrontation

49:01.942 --> 49:05.654
with another Hari Seldon
at a crisis beyond that,

49:07.239 --> 49:10.033
we both know you're
the only one up to the task.

49:13.704 --> 49:14.746
All right.

50:18.810 --> 50:22.231
I can feel your heart racing, Hari.
Don't fight it.

50:22.231 --> 50:23.732
Don't fight it. Keep calm.

50:24.316 --> 50:25.317
Just keep calm.

50:25.317 --> 50:26.944
You can breathe it. So don't fight it.

50:27.569 --> 50:28.820
You can breathe the fluid.

50:28.820 --> 50:31.448
Remember to count primes.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.452
I-- How far did we get?

50:36.328 --> 50:41.166
86,990,413.

50:42.584 --> 50:45.212
- Eighty-six million...
- Eighty-six million,

50:45.212 --> 50:46.588
nine hundred ninety thousand,

50:46.588 --> 50:49.424
- four hundred and forty-three.
- ...four hundred forty-three.

50:50.801 --> 50:54.054
Eighty-six million,
nine hundred and ninety thousand...

50:54.680 --> 50:55.597
I love you.

50:56.181 --> 50:57.432
...four hundred and sixty-one.

50:59.059 --> 51:01.186
<i>We're going
to do wonderful things together.</i>

51:27.212 --> 51:31.175
<i>How could there be nothing
and then suddenly something?</i>

51:33.177 --> 51:38.849
<i>Close your eyes,
listen to my words and dream.</i>

51:49.776 --> 51:51.695
<i>I saw her again.</i>

51:53.280 --> 51:56.700
She visited me in a thousand dreams.

52:03.081 --> 52:04.875
Now she's here.

52:08.045 --> 52:09.546
In our time.

52:11.215 --> 52:12.841
At my throat.

52:15.260 --> 52:20.599
I have to find Gaal Dornick...

52:22.643 --> 52:24.436
before she finds me.

52:27.814 --> 52:30.651
I have to destroy her...

52:34.196 --> 52:38.617
even if I have
to burn everything to do it.
