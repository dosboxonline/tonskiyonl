Good morning, Peter.
Hope you enjoyed sleeping in.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.375
Oh, there's no sleeping in
when you're an alcoholic, Lois.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.461
You just never go to sleep.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.629
Happy Valentine's Day, honey.

00:46.713 --> 00:50.342
You actually remembered
it was Valentine's Day.

00:50.342 --> 00:52.010
Of course I did.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.595
Look, I know in years past,

00:53.595 --> 00:55.597
I haven't always been
the most thoughtful partner.

00:55.597 --> 00:59.017
I'm often self-centered,
confuse my words, and shellfish.

00:59.017 --> 01:01.686
But I love you today
and every day.

01:01.770 --> 01:04.272
You are our family's rock,

01:04.356 --> 01:06.775
which is why I got you this.

01:06.775 --> 01:09.194
Oh, jewelry.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.738
Like in a commercial.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.785
A Pedalton?

01:16.785 --> 01:20.747
Okay, can I talk to you upstairs
for a near-the-vent argument?

01:23.750 --> 01:27.754
How dare you buy me something
that suggests I need exercise!

01:27.754 --> 01:30.131
This is a loud way
to say thank you.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.218
Anybody have Valentine's Day
in the divorce pool?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.594
That would be Meg.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.762
Boom, boom, boom.

01:35.762 --> 01:38.723
Picked a holiday. Smart.
She's smart.

01:38.807 --> 01:41.935
I just thought you'd like it.
I saw it on <i>The Today Show.</i>

01:42.977 --> 01:45.397
Second hour
with Hoda and Savannah

01:45.397 --> 01:47.273
or third hour
with the nonsense people?

01:47.357 --> 01:49.442
- Second hour.
- Where is it?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.118
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:58.118 --> 01:59.786
<i>I'm your instructor,
Cody Spraytan.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:03.248
<i>Are you ready to pedal so hard
your periods go away?</i>

02:03.248 --> 02:05.959
Yes! It's not healthy,
but it's convenient.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.377
<i>Now we're gonna sprint</i>

02:07.377 --> 02:09.379
<i>while I tell
a distracting personal story</i>

02:09.379 --> 02:12.465
<i>about how I almost met
Adam Levine.</i>

02:13.466 --> 02:15.343
<i>It's 2016. It's Vegas.</i>

02:15.427 --> 02:17.012
<i>I'm coming off
a horrible breakup.</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:18.513
<i>First pool party in,</i>

02:18.513 --> 02:20.682
<i>I see who I think
is a dirty man with tattoos,</i>

02:20.682 --> 02:22.017
<i>and I'm like, "Ugh."</i>

02:22.017 --> 02:25.020
<i>But then I'm like,
"Wait a minute."</i>

02:28.064 --> 02:31.317
Huh, I think I'll try
a scenic ride this morning.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.529
Let's see.
Uh, California Coastline,

02:34.529 --> 02:36.114
Gardens of Singapo...

02:36.114 --> 02:39.367
Oh, The Tour De Franz.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.578
<i>Pull over here.
Let's get a sausage.</i>

02:41.578 --> 02:43.371
We just started, Dennis.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.124
<i>I once watched a squirrel
get hit by a car right here,</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:48.376
<i>and I saw one get hit by a truck
over there.</i>

02:48.460 --> 02:50.128
Yeah, you've seen
a lot of squirrels

02:50.128 --> 02:51.588
get hit by a lot of things.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.590
<i>There are a lot
of stupid squirrels.</i>

02:53.590 --> 02:55.467
Shouldn't you be wearing
bike shorts

02:55.467 --> 02:58.094
instead of jean shorts? <i>- Eh, shorts are shorts.</i>

02:58.178 --> 02:59.929
Oh, hey,
there's a stop sign coming.

03:00.013 --> 03:02.432
<i>Give it the finger
and ride through.</i>

03:04.476 --> 03:06.436
<i>Bite me!</i>

03:06.436 --> 03:08.813
This isn't very fun.
When are we done?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.565
<i>We ride until my ass falls out.</i>

03:10.565 --> 03:12.067
It's already out.

03:12.067 --> 03:13.443
<i>Then we're done.</i>

03:22.619 --> 03:24.537
What the hell?

03:27.374 --> 03:30.001
You're not taking this
from me, bitch.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.632
Suck it, Bon.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.763
I hope that mascara
burns your eyes out.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.848
How's that cheap wine headache?

03:43.932 --> 03:46.101
Go roll in dirt, you pig.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.520
Your hair dye stinks!
Tell your daughter

03:48.520 --> 03:51.106
- to stop watching me change!
- Tell your son to stop watching me change!

03:51.106 --> 03:53.400
Peter, go cut her power!

03:54.859 --> 03:56.778
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.327
Oh, someone's in here.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.383
Whoa, did we get
that European exchange student

04:18.383 --> 04:19.884
I saw on TikTok?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.763
Hey, little man.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.890
Lois?

04:25.974 --> 04:29.019
But you're... you're... hot.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.895
All right, everyone out.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.605
I got a soupy keister.

04:36.651 --> 04:39.529
Wow, Mom. You are looking fit.

04:39.529 --> 04:40.780
Yeah, you're ripped.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.782
You look like Madonn...

04:42.866 --> 04:44.659
You want to say that again?

04:44.743 --> 04:46.286
Who do I look like?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.538
The mom from <i>Modern Family.</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:50.832
That's right. Julie Bowen.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.126
That's the appropriate answer.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.753
What do you think
of Lois's new look?

04:54.753 --> 04:57.339
I say this in the
most respectful way possible,

04:57.339 --> 04:59.007
but don't you think
she looks a little...

04:59.007 --> 05:01.301
- mannish?
- Mannish. Yeah, awesome, right?

05:01.301 --> 05:03.887
Yeah, I got to say, Peter,
I love that bike.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.723
Hey, maybe you
should give it a try, huh?

05:06.723 --> 05:09.559
No way. Name one cool person
who rides a bike.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.769
Kermit the Fro...

05:10.769 --> 05:13.772
Okay, skinny legs, here I come.

05:13.772 --> 05:16.358
Good morning.
Are you ready to sweat?

05:16.358 --> 05:19.694
I woke up sweating. <i>- Okay, let's climb this hill!</i>

05:19.778 --> 05:21.071
I want to impress you

05:21.071 --> 05:24.616
but also see if I can peek
down your sports bra.

05:24.616 --> 05:28.203
Ow! Ow! Ow! My balls.

05:28.203 --> 05:30.497
No, the other ones.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.833
Ow! Ow! Ow!

05:33.917 --> 05:35.460
Did you hear that?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.088
- I think Peter hurt his balls.
- I didn't hear anything.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.715
Hmm. Must have been at
a frequency only dogs can hear.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.309
Excuse me, I have to go bark.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.652
So, what do you think happened

06:00.652 --> 06:01.945
to my voice, Doc?

06:01.945 --> 06:03.154
Peter, I'm afraid you suffered

06:03.238 --> 06:05.198
something called Pedalton Balls.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.534
Here's a video
explaining everything.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.744
<i>Hi, I'm Oliver Platt,</i>

06:09.828 --> 06:12.080
<i>here to talk to you
about Pedalton Balls,</i>

06:12.080 --> 06:14.249
<i>a painful condition
where your testicles</i>

06:14.249 --> 06:16.501
<i>get lodged
next to your voice box.</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:18.753
It's actually part
of a long list of ailments

06:18.837 --> 06:21.089
that fat guys suffer
when they try to exercise.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.632
These include

06:22.674 --> 06:24.217
<i>Trapped Fart Disorder,</i>

06:24.217 --> 06:25.677
<i>Jump Rope Tangles,</i>

06:25.677 --> 06:26.970
<i>Push-Up Butt,</i>

06:26.970 --> 06:29.514
<i>Sock-Skin Foot and Jog Fog,</i>

06:29.514 --> 06:32.892
<i>where your sweat condenses
into a functioning cloud.</i>

06:32.976 --> 06:34.978
But don't worry.
With the help of gravity,

06:34.978 --> 06:36.771
Pedalton Balls
will clear itself.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.273
While you're waiting,

06:38.273 --> 06:41.609
check out my 1993 medium hit
<i>The Three Musketeers,</i>

06:41.693 --> 06:43.319
because I only do movies

06:43.403 --> 06:46.072
with titles
that are also candy bars.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.323
Isn't there anything I can do

06:47.407 --> 06:49.325
to help my voice
get back to normal faster?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.202
I don't know,
I just like putting on videos.

06:51.286 --> 06:54.873
I guess try doing something
with a lot of needless standing?

06:54.873 --> 06:56.750
All rise.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.294
Before we start communion,

06:59.294 --> 07:01.629
we have
a few church announcements.

07:01.713 --> 07:05.342
First off, I'm seeing
a lot of AirPods in ears,

07:05.342 --> 07:07.719
so let's get that under control.

07:07.719 --> 07:10.638
Secondly, all hymns
now identify as "they."

07:10.722 --> 07:13.975
And, of course,
"amen" is now "athem."

07:14.059 --> 07:15.810
Athem.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.395
Athem.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.900
Stewie, how would you like

07:21.900 --> 07:24.694
to go to a Mommy & Me class
with me tomorrow, huh?

07:24.778 --> 07:26.654
They haven't seen
my new look yet,

07:26.738 --> 07:29.240
and I feel like I need a win
in front of the Range Rover mom.

07:29.324 --> 07:31.076
Are you asking me out on a date?

07:31.076 --> 07:33.912
Well, I'm gonna have
to get waxed first.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.873
I want you to make it look
like Caillou.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.960
- The Body of Christ.
- Thank you, Father.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.380
Your voice. It's pristine.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.341
You know, one of our altar boys
called in sick today.

07:46.341 --> 07:49.219
How would you like to fill in
for him in the choir?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.970
Well, okay.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.265
But only if God will kill
a bunch of babies for no reason.

07:54.349 --> 07:55.600
That's not a problem.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.686
God does that a lot
in the Bible.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.370

08:24.713 --> 08:27.716
- Follow my lead.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.551

How would you like to be
a regular member of the choir?

08:46.985 --> 08:49.446
I'll do it, buddy,

08:49.446 --> 08:52.240
we shake
like that epic handshake meme.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.534
You got a deal, buddy.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.795
Everyone, let's take out
our drums for drum circle.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.508
You ready to play again?
Me, too.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.303
My refraction period
is very short.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.472
I finish fast,
but I can go a lot.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.973
Some people prefer that.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.767
A good refractor.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.596
Now let me do you.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.647
Is everyone watching?

10:05.647 --> 10:09.275
Are they impressed
with how quickly I refracted?

10:10.819 --> 10:13.446
<i>♪ He died for us,

That was wonderful, Peter.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.298
Way better
than our previous choir

10:32.382 --> 10:35.260
who killed half our congregation
during COVID.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.512
You really think
you can just come in here

10:37.512 --> 10:40.140
- and steal our spotlight?
- Aw, <i>Spotlight.</i>

10:40.140 --> 10:42.308
Yeah, before you came,
I was wrist-deep

10:42.392 --> 10:43.727
in every old lady's casserole.

10:43.727 --> 10:45.729
Now I'm lucky
if I get just a sniff

10:45.729 --> 10:46.938
of an old lady's casserole.

10:47.022 --> 10:48.440
I like this story.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.568
If you knew what was good
for you, you'd quit right now.

10:51.568 --> 10:53.820
I'm not quitting.
And I'm not gonna be bullied

10:53.820 --> 10:55.822
by some noodle-armed kids.

10:55.822 --> 10:58.324
Hey, we're tough Catholic kids.
We've been assaulted

10:58.408 --> 11:01.369
by an army of older brothers
and sisters our entire lives.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.621
You ever have an older sister
sit on your head

11:03.705 --> 11:05.790
for an entire
Notre Dame football game?

11:05.874 --> 11:07.792
- Because I have.
- Hey, Peter,

11:07.876 --> 11:10.378
what did the kneeling apparatus
say to the ankle?

11:10.462 --> 11:11.838
"Pew."

11:14.174 --> 11:17.218
I'm your rides home, guys.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.058
Okay, I'm gonna go heat up
your bottle, Stewie.

11:23.058 --> 11:25.101
I'll be right back.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.604
Hey, how was your "date"?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.230
It's still going.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.150
- I'm pretty close to done with this.
- When we parked the car,

11:32.150 --> 11:33.818
she did that thing
where she leaned over

11:33.902 --> 11:35.445
and unbuckled me
from my car seat.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.572
And she took a little extra time

11:37.572 --> 11:40.200
fishing around
for that bottom safety belt.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.993
You know what that means.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.621
- Please stop.
- The only downside is she has kids.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.665
But I said I'm cool with it,
and whoosh, the doors flew open.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.126
That's a little tip.
I've got a little tip, too.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.670
Yes?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.880
- What?
- Someone did...

11:53.880 --> 11:56.007
- I'm here now. What is it?
- Oh.

11:56.091 --> 11:59.219
Uh, n-no, I was using that
to punctuate my sentences.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.805
Don't do that. I walked very far

12:01.805 --> 12:04.432
thinking I'd get a carrot.
Very far.

12:04.516 --> 12:07.268
There's no carrots, guys.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.482
So, this is my place.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.942
I'm living with my parents
right now,

12:13.942 --> 12:15.193
which isn't preferred,

12:15.193 --> 12:16.528
but they always keep yogurt
in the fridge,

12:16.528 --> 12:17.904
so that's pretty tight.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.614
All right, good night, Stewie.

12:19.698 --> 12:23.034
I had a really nice day
with you.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.287
Wait, that's it?

12:26.371 --> 12:29.124
You're leaving? I thought...

12:33.628 --> 12:35.922
Oh, my little buddy.

12:36.006 --> 12:39.050
You're upset.
Okay, okay, I'll tell you what.

12:39.134 --> 12:43.221
You can sleep with Mommy
in the big bed tonight, okay?

12:43.221 --> 12:44.639
The big bed?

12:44.723 --> 12:47.100
Well, Rupert, don't wait up,
'cause I'm gonna be...

12:52.063 --> 12:53.481
Father,

12:53.565 --> 12:54.941
can I talk to you for a minute?

12:55.025 --> 12:57.110
Peter, come in.
What's on your mind?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.696
It's just
I really like singing here.

12:59.696 --> 13:03.074
I finally found a way I can
positively contribute in church.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.869
But the other choirboys hate me.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.038
You know, a wise man once said,

13:08.038 --> 13:09.956
"The thing about humanity

13:10.040 --> 13:12.959
is that we get stronger
with adversity."

13:13.043 --> 13:14.586
Who said that? Jesus?

13:14.586 --> 13:17.547
No, it was Justin Bieber's dad
on Twitter.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.133
The answer to pretty much all
of life's questions

13:20.133 --> 13:21.926
are on Twitter. Try there.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.137
So you're not gonna help me?

13:24.137 --> 13:26.765
Oh, I'm not allowed
to talk to kids alone.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.933
Not because of anything <i>I</i> did.

13:29.017 --> 13:32.645
It was, you know,
all the other dingbats.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.609
Well, I guess
I'm on my own, then.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.528
Oh, no, you're not.

13:44.699 --> 13:45.950
Jesus?

13:46.034 --> 13:48.203
I am here to help you
with your problem.

13:48.203 --> 13:49.829
You're gonna help me
win an Emmy?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.332
Whoa, no, no, no.
Your choir problem.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.542
There's some things
not even I can do.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.337
- Maybe you can ask your dad?
- I'm not gonna ask my dad.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.680
Uh-oh, someone better call Noah,

14:06.680 --> 14:09.849
because I think one
of his hippos fell off the ark.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.602
Bible burn.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.562
Come on, guys.
I came here to make peace.

14:14.646 --> 14:17.190
And I brought someone with me

14:17.190 --> 14:18.942
Jesus Christ.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.906
That's not Jesus.
Why's he so tan?

14:24.906 --> 14:28.034
Yeah, everyone knows that Jesus
was Paul Bettany pale.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.411
Guys, it's really me.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.122
Now, let's talk
about the power of forgiveness

14:32.122 --> 14:33.915
while I lean on my own knee.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.667
Ew, look at his toenails.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.544
They're so long and yellow.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.629
They keep growing
after you die, okay?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.840
You guys
are supposed to listen to me.

14:44.592 --> 14:47.012
Hey, want to know what my
favorite book of the Bible is?

14:47.012 --> 14:49.097
The Old Testes-ment.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.265
That's not how you say it.

14:50.265 --> 14:52.058
They're gonna kick you
in the schnutz.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.812
Those kids are really mean.

14:55.812 --> 14:57.439
Well,
we're taking a new approach.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.232
You're gonna
beat the crap out of them,

14:59.232 --> 15:00.734
and I'm gonna help you do it.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.485
But would I be the first person

15:02.569 --> 15:05.655
to be violent to someone else
in the name of Jesus Christ?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.992
No, that's kind of
religion's whole deal.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.665
Morning. Sorry
if I'm walking a little funny.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.626
<i>Crazy</i> night.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.128
Hey, so don't tell anybody,

15:20.128 --> 15:23.006
but I slept with Lois
last night.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.175
Who are you gonna tell? Chris?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.468
You can tell Chris.

15:26.468 --> 15:27.844
I don't know
what you think you're doing,

15:27.844 --> 15:29.721
but it's not
what you think you're doing.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.306
Look, all I know
is I woke up sideways

15:31.306 --> 15:33.391
on the other end of the bed
from where I started.

15:33.475 --> 15:35.226
But tonight is the night.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.729
It is going down.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.230
- What is?
- It.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.400
- What's "it"?
- Capital "I," capital "T."

15:42.484 --> 15:44.944
- That's still nothing.
- Turn on Kenny Loggins,

15:45.028 --> 15:47.238
- because "This Is It."
- What?

15:47.322 --> 15:50.700
The IT department called,
and they asked for a lot of RAM.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.202
Well, that one
kind of makes sense.

15:52.202 --> 15:55.288
After tonight, Cousin Itt
isn't gonna be the only one

15:55.372 --> 15:57.248
- covered in hair.
- Okay, nope. I'm out.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.918
Gonna go finish my coffee
in the sunroom.

15:59.918 --> 16:02.671
Chris was FaceTiming
with a foot in there.

16:02.671 --> 16:04.506
I'm gonna just call it a day.
Go to sleep.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.591
Dogs can just do that.

16:10.512 --> 16:15.433
Does anyone know how to send
athlete's foot spray to Romania?

16:21.064 --> 16:23.566
All right, that's all of 'em.

16:23.650 --> 16:26.486
Good. Now go refill
all the holy water.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.529
What am I doing here?

16:27.529 --> 16:29.406
Stow the hymnals,
dust the altar.

16:29.406 --> 16:31.408
I'm supposed to be training
to fight,

16:31.408 --> 16:33.076
and you're having me
clean the church.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.578
Show me "Sign of the Cross."

16:37.247 --> 16:39.332
No. Really show me.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.878
Now show me "Stow the Hymnals."

16:46.381 --> 16:49.426
Oh, you've been teaching me
this whole time.

16:49.426 --> 16:51.302
I love these scenes.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.139
Now show me "Book of Mark."

16:54.139 --> 16:57.392
Ow! I didn't do
the reading ones.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.608
Tonight is the night, Rupert.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.818
She's gonna be here any minute,

17:06.818 --> 17:08.570
and I need everything
to be perfect.

17:08.570 --> 17:12.198
You finally get to watch,
you little freak.

17:15.243 --> 17:17.746
Oh, well, look at you,
Mr. Sleepyhead.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.873
Mind if I join you?

17:19.873 --> 17:21.458
Don't mind at all.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.755
Wait.
Where's that rippling hot bod?

17:26.755 --> 17:29.132
Oh, it feels good
to have my old body back.

17:29.132 --> 17:31.509
I used that Pedalton
for three days.

17:31.593 --> 17:33.219
They said
that was a world record.

17:33.303 --> 17:36.097
And I am out of here.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.142
No, you can't still watch.

17:39.142 --> 17:41.269
There's nothing to watch.
It's not happening.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.448
We told you to get lost,
Griffin.

17:53.448 --> 17:54.699
I did get lost.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.993
In the power of Christ.

17:59.204 --> 18:01.664
Go get him, boys.

18:12.175 --> 18:14.511
Looks like someone
learned how to fight.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.388
Yeah,
I did a whole <i>Karate Kid</i> thing.

18:16.388 --> 18:19.391
What's that? I'm only allowed
to watch Kirk Cameron movies.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.726
Aw, you poor dude.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.081
Just give up already.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.833
You're finished.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.968
Finish him.

19:05.437 --> 19:07.480
Yeah! Eat cross!

19:07.564 --> 19:10.191
- You did it, Peter.
- Yeah! High five!

19:10.275 --> 19:11.943
Cool scar.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.119
Ow, my balls!

19:21.119 --> 19:23.079
Ow, my balls?

19:23.163 --> 19:25.040
Hey, my voice is back to normal.

19:25.040 --> 19:26.499
Oh, well, look at that.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.626
I guess you can't sing
in the choir anymore.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.128
I guess not.

19:30.128 --> 19:32.047
Hey, you guys
want to call a truce?

19:32.047 --> 19:34.174
And maybe don't tell your dads
I beat you up?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.092
Yeah.
That's probably a good idea.

19:36.176 --> 19:37.719
Hey,
why you guys so mean anyway?

19:37.719 --> 19:40.972
What did anybody ever do
to a bunch of choirboys?

19:41.056 --> 19:43.475
Oh, my stars.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.708
Hi, I'm Lois Griffin.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.752
Please, before you buy one
of these pieces of equipment,

20:52.836 --> 20:55.547
think about if it's gonna be
better than watching <i>Ozark.</i>

20:55.547 --> 20:57.507
Thank you.

20:57.507 --> 21:00.927
Damn it!
Who put that weight there?!
