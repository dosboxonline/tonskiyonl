WEBVTT

01:16.492 --> 01:18.392
Please let me get in.

01:23.025 --> 01:24.326
Finley sinclair?

01:24.359 --> 01:25.725
Yes!

02:15.292 --> 02:16.758
Is that you?

02:17.426 --> 02:18.758
Yeah.

02:22.858 --> 02:23.858
How'd it go?

02:25.959 --> 02:27.925
So much for prayers.

02:28.526 --> 02:29.693
Oh, honey.

02:31.092 --> 02:33.492
You can still audition
one more time in the fall.

02:35.159 --> 02:37.992
Come here. I know.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.925
You might need to
think about a plan b.

02:46.025 --> 02:48.725
Maybe what you need
is a change of scenery.

02:50.959 --> 02:53.359
Maybe I can try
that semester abroad program

02:53.392 --> 02:54.992
that Alex did.

03:02.326 --> 03:04.159
<i>I'd like to welcome you
on this flight</i>

03:04.192 --> 03:05.459
<i>to Dublin, Ireland.</i>

03:06.192 --> 03:09.059
<i>It will take us approximately
six hours and ten minutes</i>

03:09.092 --> 03:10.292
<i>of flight time...</i>

03:10.758 --> 03:14.192
Hey, there's an extra seat
in first class if you want it.

03:14.226 --> 03:15.426
It's a long flight to Ireland.

03:18.392 --> 03:19.992
- Yes, please.
- Come on.

03:28.426 --> 03:29.825
Have fun.

03:35.292 --> 03:38.725
- Magazine.
- Yeah, thank you.

03:54.092 --> 03:56.825
Sir, your friend needs to
put her seat belt on.

03:56.858 --> 03:58.426
Yeah, thanks.

04:00.992 --> 04:04.259
As much as I'd love a beautiful
girl drooling on my shoulder,

04:04.292 --> 04:06.125
you better buckle up.

04:07.059 --> 04:09.459
I'm... I'm so sorry. Um...

04:09.492 --> 04:12.092
And don't worry,
your snoring is cute.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.125
I'm so sorry. I don't... I didn't
even think I would fall asleep.

04:15.159 --> 04:17.059
It's not something I...

04:22.892 --> 04:24.426
- Beckett rush?
- Geez.

04:24.459 --> 04:26.825
I've gotten this far without
being bothered, all right.

04:26.858 --> 04:28.892
Look, if you keep quiet,
I'll give you an autograph

04:28.925 --> 04:30.825
or something when we land.
Just, no body parts,

04:30.858 --> 04:32.326
I stopped doing that
a while ago.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.059
- Oh.
- Flight attendant probably

04:34.092 --> 04:36.268
thought she was making your year
seating you next to me.

04:36.292 --> 04:39.025
We can do a selfie or something,
just when we land. All right.

04:39.059 --> 04:40.959
I don't want to attract
any attention right now.

04:40.992 --> 04:42.959
I really don't want anything
from you.

04:43.725 --> 04:45.758
Somebody's grumpy
when they wake up.

04:45.792 --> 04:48.359
No,
but arrogance makes me grumpy.

04:48.392 --> 04:50.226
Some people mistake confidence
for arrogance.

04:50.259 --> 04:51.925
I'm pretty sure
it's just arrogance.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.459
I know your type.

04:56.526 --> 04:57.858
So, since you know my name,

04:57.892 --> 05:00.025
I think it's only fair
that I know yours.

05:02.459 --> 05:04.426
Finley sinclair.

05:04.459 --> 05:06.925
And what brings you to Ireland,
Finley sinclair?

05:06.959 --> 05:09.059
A semester abroad program
at my college.

05:11.092 --> 05:14.025
My brother did this a few
years ago, and he loved it.

05:15.825 --> 05:17.125
Changed his whole life.

05:18.059 --> 05:19.426
Maybe it'll work for me.

05:19.459 --> 05:21.326
Hmm. So you have issues?

05:23.092 --> 05:25.825
Life can be tough
outside of the celebrity bubble.

05:25.858 --> 05:28.025
You know, in the real world.

05:28.059 --> 05:30.159
- A bit of advice for you.
- Hmm?

05:30.192 --> 05:32.092
You might wanna brush up on
your people skills

05:32.125 --> 05:34.359
if you're gonna make it
in a small Irish town.

05:34.392 --> 05:35.426
Oh!

05:35.459 --> 05:39.059
And are you an expert
on small towns in Ireland?

05:39.092 --> 05:40.959
Yeah, I am, actually.

05:40.992 --> 05:43.226
We've shot three <i>dawn of the</i>
<i>dragon</i> movies there.

05:43.259 --> 05:44.825
About to shoot number four.

05:47.025 --> 05:49.925
TouchÃ©. I sit corrected.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.101
You know,
you look really beautiful

05:53.125 --> 05:54.825
when you admit
that you're wrong.

06:21.292 --> 06:23.292
Yeah, I didn't like
that article either.

06:36.959 --> 06:38.292
Ba-bye!

06:38.326 --> 06:39.326
Bye!

06:40.092 --> 06:43.326
Whoa!
You any good on that thing?

06:43.858 --> 06:46.326
Not good enough.
But I'm going to be

06:46.359 --> 06:47.959
practicing a lot while I'm here,

06:47.992 --> 06:49.858
and working
on a new audition piece.

06:49.892 --> 06:52.292
Sounds boring,
but suit yourself.

06:52.326 --> 06:54.025
Who knows, maybe we'll run
into each other

06:54.059 --> 06:55.492
in a pub somewhere, spindly?

06:56.226 --> 06:58.725
It's Finley,
and I seriously doubt that.

07:00.025 --> 07:02.426
Well, I hope you find
what you're looking for

07:02.459 --> 07:05.459
and maybe even a little bit
of fun, while you're at it.

07:05.492 --> 07:08.792
Welcome to Ireland,
Felicity sinclair.

07:09.192 --> 07:10.492
It's...

07:10.526 --> 07:11.858
Peace out.

07:12.392 --> 07:13.959
Have a nice trip. Bye, bye.

07:13.992 --> 07:15.459
Okay, never mind.

07:24.426 --> 07:26.192
Oh, my gosh, it's Beckett.

07:26.226 --> 07:27.459
Oh, my gosh.

07:32.292 --> 07:35.725
- Will you sign this for me?
- All right, okay, one at a time.

07:41.925 --> 07:43.526
Finley!

07:43.559 --> 07:45.092
Hey you.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.925
Oh! You look exactly
like your picture.

07:46.959 --> 07:49.192
- Emma?
- We're sisters for four months.

07:49.226 --> 07:51.092
Okay,
it's nice to meet you, too.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.792
I heard Beckett rush
is at the airport.

07:52.825 --> 07:54.345
His new movie is like
the biggest thing

07:54.559 --> 07:57.792
that has ever happened
in carlingford. Do you like him?

07:57.825 --> 08:00.059
You know,
a little too cocky for me.

08:00.092 --> 08:02.025
I love him. Fact!

08:03.792 --> 08:05.192
Hello, Finley!

08:05.226 --> 08:08.492
- Hi!
- It is so good to have you.

08:08.526 --> 08:10.359
We just loved your brother.

08:10.392 --> 08:12.059
He was one of the family.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.492
And now you are, too.

08:13.526 --> 08:15.892
The good news
is that we inherited

08:15.925 --> 08:17.168
a bed and breakfast
three months ago.

08:17.192 --> 08:20.792
Sean has retired from the army,
and we're running it together.

08:21.226 --> 08:23.125
We're still trying
to figure it all out.

08:23.526 --> 08:24.992
Come on, everyone,
let's get going

08:25.025 --> 08:27.092
before we get into
the second hour in the car park.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.459
I'll get your luggage.

08:28.492 --> 08:30.792
Thank you,
I can get this at least.

08:32.292 --> 08:34.259
Take this.

08:54.259 --> 08:56.326
<i>This town
might be a wee bit small</i>

08:56.359 --> 08:58.959
<i>for a New York girl,
but we'll get you out</i>

08:58.992 --> 09:00.502
<i>to show you
the rest of the country soon.</i>

09:00.526 --> 09:02.159
<i>I can't wait to see it all.</i>

09:02.192 --> 09:03.925
<i>The old castles,
the cliffs of moher.</i>

09:03.959 --> 09:06.226
<i>My brother used to talk about
that place all the time.</i>

09:06.259 --> 09:09.059
<i>- We'll take you all over.
- That would be amazing.</i>

09:28.226 --> 09:29.492
Here we are.

09:29.526 --> 09:31.092
Emma, go show Finley
to her room.

09:31.125 --> 09:32.492
I'll give you
the full tour later.

09:32.526 --> 09:34.259
There's a trampoline
around the back.

09:34.292 --> 09:35.792
If you jump high enough,
you can see

09:35.825 --> 09:37.992
into the next-door
neighbor's bathroom.

09:38.025 --> 09:40.792
Don't worry, all the guests are
at the other side of the house.

09:40.825 --> 09:43.125
You can play your violin
up here anytime.

09:43.159 --> 09:44.359
No one will hear ya.

09:44.392 --> 09:46.226
This is my room.

09:46.259 --> 09:48.259
Mom thought
that you'd like your own one.

09:48.292 --> 09:50.992
But yours has the best views.
My nan used to live in it.

09:51.025 --> 09:54.125
She actually died there.
I wouldn't be scared about that.

09:54.159 --> 09:56.492
Obviously, I'm around the corner

09:56.526 --> 10:00.892
if you ever wanna talk,
do nails, sister things

10:00.925 --> 10:03.326
leave her alone, Emma.
Finley needs some rest.

10:03.359 --> 10:05.292
She has her orientation
in the morning.

10:06.559 --> 10:07.892
Out!

10:21.092 --> 10:22.092
Good morning, Finley.

10:22.292 --> 10:24.192
- Hey, did you sleep well?
- All right.

10:24.226 --> 10:25.992
So, we're just busy
serving the guests.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.092
Pour yourself some tea.
Sean'll cook you some eggs.

10:28.125 --> 10:29.892
Coming right up!

10:29.925 --> 10:31.758
I need to get my hair to behave.

10:31.792 --> 10:33.259
Emma, you mustn't go out there!

10:33.292 --> 10:35.392
I don't want you
disturbing the guests.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.459
Last time, I found her chatting
on for half an hour

10:37.492 --> 10:39.368
with one of the guests
about her earthworm collection.

10:39.392 --> 10:41.059
I have a passion for biology.

10:41.092 --> 10:42.868
They don't need to hear about
earthworm droppings

10:42.892 --> 10:43.593
at breakfast.

10:43.825 --> 10:45.758
Go around.
Why do you always have to...

10:49.959 --> 10:53.858
Always go clockwise!
That's our new system!

10:53.892 --> 10:55.392
Never mind.
This is getting cold.

10:55.426 --> 10:57.725
And we can't afford
any bad reviews.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.925
We can't go out there
wearing cranberry juice.

11:01.959 --> 11:03.758
What would our guests think
of that?

11:08.392 --> 11:09.626
Love, I hate to ask.

11:09.659 --> 11:12.359
But would you mind taking this
to the gentleman in the corner?

11:12.392 --> 11:14.959
All you have to do is set
the plate down on the table,

11:14.992 --> 11:16.025
smile, and walk away.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.025
Yeah, of course.

11:27.992 --> 11:29.459
You?

11:29.492 --> 11:31.192
Good morning to you as well.

11:31.226 --> 11:33.159
You didn't spit in my food,
did you?

11:33.192 --> 11:35.168
- What are you doing here?
- What does it look like?

11:35.192 --> 11:37.492
- I'm a guest.
- In one of these rooms?

11:37.758 --> 11:40.025
Yeah,
that's usually how it works.

11:40.059 --> 11:41.326
Are you stalking me?

11:41.359 --> 11:42.402
- No!
- I thought you might be.

11:42.426 --> 11:44.959
I didn't buy that whole
"I'm not interested" bit.

11:45.326 --> 11:46.025
I'm staying here, too.

11:46.326 --> 11:48.526
- What, the callahans
are your host family?

11:48.559 --> 11:50.426
- Yeah.
- Oh.

11:50.459 --> 11:52.992
Shouldn't you be at some
boujee hotel with your harem?

11:53.025 --> 11:54.792
What are you talking about?
This is boujee.

11:54.825 --> 11:58.025
It's posh. The cooking's great.
And the service is even better.

11:58.059 --> 11:59.059
Usually.

11:59.593 --> 12:02.192
I have to go to orientation,
so enjoy.

12:02.226 --> 12:04.101
Well, I'll be staying here
for the next few months

12:04.125 --> 12:06.159
while we film.
So, no sneaking up

12:06.192 --> 12:08.459
- into my room, young lady.
- Ooh. Don't worry.

12:08.492 --> 12:11.392
I'm not supposed to bother the
guests. Even if they bother me.

12:11.959 --> 12:13.492
What do you have against me?

12:13.693 --> 12:15.492
I am trying to stay focused...

12:17.326 --> 12:20.758
And I just don't think
you're gonna help with that.

12:21.025 --> 12:23.426
- And how would you know?
- I see the news.

12:24.192 --> 12:26.959
Well, maybe things aren't always
as they seem.

12:26.992 --> 12:28.326
I know your type.

12:29.426 --> 12:30.959
I'll see you later, frankey.

12:31.326 --> 12:33.892
Hmm. It's Finley, but good try.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.292
Um...

12:40.858 --> 12:44.092
Why is Beckett rush
in the dining room?

12:44.125 --> 12:45.326
What? No.

12:45.725 --> 12:48.326
No, that's definitely him.

12:49.858 --> 12:51.125
You can't tell anyone.

12:51.159 --> 12:54.426
Beckett...
Becket rush is in my house.

12:54.459 --> 12:56.392
I'd never even heard of him
till yesterday.

12:56.426 --> 12:58.125
Of course, you didn't.
You're such a dad.

12:58.159 --> 13:00.392
He's only like, the biggest
movie star in the world.

13:00.426 --> 13:02.192
She's got posters
of him in her room.

13:02.226 --> 13:04.059
Ah, that's why I recognized him.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.858
Nora, dear.

13:08.825 --> 13:10.426
Do you have any jam
for the scones?

13:10.459 --> 13:11.858
Yes, sure, love.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.758
Just made it fresh yesterday.

13:14.092 --> 13:16.059
Ah. Brilliant. Cheers.

13:20.825 --> 13:22.426
Your daughter has lost her mind.

13:22.459 --> 13:24.526
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell her.

13:24.559 --> 13:27.192
Now not a word.

13:27.226 --> 13:29.159
We have promised him
to keep it quiet.

13:29.192 --> 13:30.526
The whole town
is gonna find out.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.758
Well, it's not gonna be
because of us.

13:32.792 --> 13:35.459
We are going to give him
a place away from the press.

13:35.492 --> 13:37.792
If they find out,
the b&b could be at risk.

13:37.825 --> 13:40.168
We can't afford a bad review
from an international celebrity

13:40.192 --> 13:41.492
right when we're starting out.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.492
Oh, shite!

13:55.392 --> 13:57.825
I heard the heart slayer
is staying at your b&b?

13:57.858 --> 14:00.326
See, the whole town knows,
and I can't say a word.

14:00.359 --> 14:03.192
Don't worry, Irish small towns
are good at keeping secrets.

14:03.226 --> 14:04.758
The people here
won't let it out.

14:04.792 --> 14:05.792
Yeah, and if they do,

14:05.825 --> 14:07.792
my parents'll lose
their entire life savings,

14:07.825 --> 14:09.392
and I'll end up in an orphanage.

14:09.858 --> 14:12.825
Your mom is going to be washing
his sheets. How insane is that?

14:12.858 --> 14:15.359
Not the first thing
that came to my mind, but yes.

14:15.626 --> 14:19.092
Hey, maybe Beckett will ask you
to the dance.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.259
Right. The hottest guy
in the whole world

14:21.292 --> 14:23.192
is gonna break up
with Taylor risdale.

14:23.226 --> 14:24.758
Look me in the eye and say,

14:24.792 --> 14:27.459
"hey, Emma,
will you go out with me?"

14:29.025 --> 14:31.192
No one has ever even
asked me to it.

14:31.226 --> 14:32.959
Bull. What's this dance?

14:33.259 --> 14:35.101
It's the big town festival
that happens every Autumn.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.925
It's where all of our parents
fell in love. It's disgusting.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.959
It's amazing.
The whole town comes out for it.

14:40.159 --> 14:41.426
Outside, under the lights.

14:41.693 --> 14:43.426
- It's so romantic.
- Or depressing.

14:43.459 --> 14:45.526
Guys are already
starting to ask.

14:45.559 --> 14:47.359
Well, maybe this is your year.

14:49.559 --> 14:51.858
Yeah, maybe.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.226
Any lads you fancy yet?

14:55.159 --> 14:57.326
It's just my first day.

14:57.359 --> 14:58.725
Maybe Beckett will ask you.

14:59.392 --> 15:03.459
I think he prefers
his snooty celebrity soirees.

15:03.492 --> 15:05.025
Not really my type.

15:06.992 --> 15:09.226
Dragons!

15:09.259 --> 15:11.025
To the bottom lines.

15:13.326 --> 15:15.059
Archers, at the ready!

15:16.459 --> 15:18.159
Oriana!

15:18.192 --> 15:19.359
My love!

15:19.925 --> 15:22.092
Come with me, I'll protect you.

15:24.792 --> 15:26.159
My bow!

15:27.559 --> 15:29.492
Stay close.

15:38.359 --> 15:40.725
Hurry up, keep going.

15:44.959 --> 15:48.959
If you save me, my father
might finally accept our love,

15:48.992 --> 15:50.492
my one true knight.

15:51.259 --> 15:52.492
Duck!

15:57.526 --> 15:58.992
More dragons.

16:03.259 --> 16:04.892
We have to go, now!

16:21.892 --> 16:25.758
I am Steele markov,
son of talagorn.

16:25.792 --> 16:27.226
May this arrow be true,

16:27.259 --> 16:29.159
and find
the heart of this beast.

16:29.192 --> 16:30.192
<i>Cut!</i>

16:31.892 --> 16:33.758
Okay, guys, back to one.

16:37.992 --> 16:40.125
How was that? Did you feel it?

16:40.159 --> 16:41.092
Yeah. Sure.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.992
Beck. Beck.
Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck.

16:44.526 --> 16:47.825
How are you, man?
Okay yeah, everything good?

16:47.858 --> 16:49.825
- Yeah.
- What the bloody hell was that?

16:49.858 --> 16:50.858
Huh?

16:51.159 --> 16:53.435
I just thought I'd try something
a little more subtle, you know?

16:53.459 --> 16:54.959
Subtle? Can you amp it up, man?

16:54.992 --> 16:57.326
- I can amp it up.
- Great. Okay, good.

16:57.792 --> 17:00.892
Because, if not, my friend,
I am afraid,

17:00.925 --> 17:03.292
we're going to have to kill off
your character.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.259
I am joking.

17:09.291 --> 17:12.092
I no serious.
I make a joke, used to feel.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.825
Okay, he can do it, guys.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.125
He's okay. Let's go.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.492
He can do it, I think.

17:16.526 --> 17:17.892
Back to one!

17:17.925 --> 17:19.758
Take 17.

17:19.791 --> 17:20.892
You okay?

17:20.925 --> 17:22.358
- Yeah.
- All right, good.

17:22.392 --> 17:24.291
Hey, listen, I heard
the studio is considering

17:24.326 --> 17:26.459
a trilogy of Steele markov
spin-off movies

17:26.492 --> 17:28.892
for you and Taylor. So,
you'll finally be getting paid

17:28.925 --> 17:31.192
what you're worth,
plus back end.

17:31.226 --> 17:33.359
So, you know,
just give him what he wants.

17:34.092 --> 17:35.359
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:35.392 --> 17:36.925
Don't screw this up.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.192
Okay, just give me some space.
Okay.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.825
Yes, whatever you need.
Of course.

17:41.858 --> 17:43.426
I'm here for you. All right.

17:43.459 --> 17:44.892
Thanks.

17:46.492 --> 17:48.426
<i>So one more like that, please.</i>

17:48.858 --> 17:50.758
Do it again.

18:01.492 --> 18:04.192
- It's just me.
- Oh, come in, Nora.

18:04.892 --> 18:08.192
Finley, I'm sorry,
but we can't take you

18:08.226 --> 18:09.792
to the cliffs of moher
this weekend.

18:09.825 --> 18:12.858
Sean has to fix a heater
and re-tile a bathroom,

18:12.892 --> 18:15.392
so I have to do the hosting
while he's working.

18:15.426 --> 18:18.326
Oh, that's... Yeah, that's okay.

18:18.359 --> 18:20.959
But I got you a bike down
at the shops today.

18:20.992 --> 18:23.292
So, you can use that
to get around town at least.

18:23.326 --> 18:24.426
Thank you. Yeah. No.

18:24.459 --> 18:26.159
You know, we...
I have plenty of time

18:26.192 --> 18:28.892
- to see the rest of the country.
- Aye, plenty.

18:30.825 --> 18:32.792
Listen, I was, um...

18:32.825 --> 18:34.825
Cleaning up in here
a few weeks ago,

18:34.858 --> 18:36.135
getting the place ready for you.

18:36.159 --> 18:38.426
And I found this
under the dresser.

18:39.858 --> 18:42.326
It's Alex's journal
from when he was here.

18:43.459 --> 18:46.159
I didn't pry,
or look or anything,

18:46.192 --> 18:48.526
but maybe just a little.

18:48.559 --> 18:52.825
Enough to see it's got
all his drawings and writings.

18:53.925 --> 18:55.459
It's old-fashioned like.

18:55.858 --> 18:57.825
Yeah, he was like that.

18:57.858 --> 19:00.159
I was gonna send it
to your mum, but...

19:00.892 --> 19:03.426
Then I just thought
I'd give it to you. I...

19:04.192 --> 19:06.925
I wouldn't want it
to get lost in the post.

19:08.459 --> 19:12.825
Thank you, Nora.
This is... amazing.

19:14.125 --> 19:16.226
He was always working
on those drawings.

19:18.959 --> 19:21.758
Now you can see all the things
he loved here.

19:24.192 --> 19:28.992
Yeah, he was so at peace,
you know, when he...

19:29.025 --> 19:30.825
When he came back, and...

19:32.559 --> 19:34.359
He was just an amazing brother.

19:35.459 --> 19:36.992
He was.

19:43.092 --> 19:46.392
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to bring up sad memories.

19:46.426 --> 19:47.758
It's okay.

20:49.025 --> 20:50.892
Are you done yet?

20:50.925 --> 20:52.825
I don't like dead bodies
near my feet.

20:52.858 --> 20:56.025
Yeah, are there more crosses
like this around here?

20:56.059 --> 20:58.092
Yeah, like everywhere.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.159
Oh.

21:08.459 --> 21:09.825
Oh, come on, Finley.

21:09.858 --> 21:11.892
I think something
just touched me.

21:11.925 --> 21:13.825
Yeah. I've got
to get practicing anyway.

21:14.059 --> 21:15.359
Good. Let's go.

21:15.392 --> 21:17.858
Run! It's no bother.
Oh, sorry about that.

21:17.892 --> 21:20.159
Have a good day.
Come on, Finley.

21:24.192 --> 21:25.725
Okay.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.159
Nora? You can just come in.

21:45.392 --> 21:46.892
What are you doing here?

21:46.925 --> 21:49.025
You're pretty good
on that thing, you know.

21:49.992 --> 21:51.426
You heard me?

21:51.459 --> 21:53.925
Yeah,
you play like your personality.

21:54.326 --> 21:55.825
And how is that?

21:55.858 --> 21:57.792
Beautiful, but a bit stiff.

21:58.892 --> 22:00.992
What are you doing
up here anyway?

22:01.025 --> 22:03.426
- I'm about to ask you a favor.
- I'm about to say no.

22:03.459 --> 22:05.025
And I'm about to ignore that.

22:05.426 --> 22:07.059
I need some help
running my lines,

22:07.092 --> 22:08.992
- like somebody to work off with.
- No.

22:09.025 --> 22:11.259
How can you say no to this face?
Huh?

22:11.292 --> 22:13.825
Oh, well, I am up-to-date
on all of my shots

22:13.858 --> 22:15.326
and immune to everything.

22:15.359 --> 22:17.526
- Come on, Frankie.
- It's Finley.

22:17.559 --> 22:19.892
No wonder you don't
remember your lines.

22:23.326 --> 22:24.892
Look...

22:26.858 --> 22:29.492
Things have been tough on set.
And my scenes aren't going well.

22:29.526 --> 22:33.059
Um... I'm in my head,
and I need something new

22:33.092 --> 22:34.459
to break me out of it.

22:37.092 --> 22:40.192
Yeah, I...
I know all about that.

22:42.559 --> 22:44.858
Cool drawing. Do you do this?

22:44.892 --> 22:48.292
No. Hey,
I did not say you could come in.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.335
Why? Are all your deepest,
darkest secrets in there?

22:50.359 --> 22:54.059
No, this is my brother's
from when he spent time here.

22:54.593 --> 22:57.192
I just... I can't get
this cross out of my mind.

22:57.226 --> 22:59.858
I mean, why would he write
my name at the bottom of this?

22:59.892 --> 23:01.226
Have you seen this anywhere?

23:01.259 --> 23:03.235
Yeah, there's crosses like that
all over the place.

23:03.259 --> 23:05.192
No. I need to find this one.

23:05.226 --> 23:08.159
So why don't you just text him
and ask him where it is?

23:09.559 --> 23:12.925
He's... dead.

23:15.292 --> 23:17.159
Oh! Wow.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.992
I'm sorry. I didn't...

23:21.792 --> 23:22.992
I didn't know.

23:26.226 --> 23:27.426
What happened?

23:28.426 --> 23:30.526
I don't really talk about it.

23:30.559 --> 23:33.892
Especially not with
Steele markov, the heart slayer.

23:34.892 --> 23:38.025
Well, I'd like to think
I'm a little bit more than that.

23:41.359 --> 23:44.259
If you ever wanna talk,
I'm here.

23:44.292 --> 23:45.725
Seriously.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.892
Well, not here in this room,
exactly.

23:48.925 --> 23:50.825
'Cause I'm not allowed in.

23:53.492 --> 23:56.992
We could talk downstairs
or wherever you want.

24:00.359 --> 24:02.526
Okay, let's go.

24:02.559 --> 24:03.992
Where?

24:04.559 --> 24:06.326
Run your lines.

24:06.359 --> 24:08.526
Really? 'Cause we don't have to.

24:08.559 --> 24:10.858
Come on,
before I change my mind.

24:13.292 --> 24:16.092
Oriana, we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

24:16.125 --> 24:17.858
My father is the king.

24:17.892 --> 24:21.259
He won't allow anything
to interfere with his conquest.

24:21.292 --> 24:23.492
He's going to marry me off
to the prince of moor.

24:23.526 --> 24:25.758
He'll kill you
if you get in the way.

24:25.792 --> 24:27.992
Well, I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

24:28.025 --> 24:30.059
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

24:33.059 --> 24:34.292
Come on.

24:34.326 --> 24:35.492
- I'm sorry.
- Okay.

24:35.526 --> 24:37.925
- It's so bad.
- Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

24:37.959 --> 24:40.892
Just give me a minute here.
I got to find it.

24:42.226 --> 24:43.392
Right.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.392
Okay...

24:56.392 --> 25:00.125
Oriana, we must find a way.
Don't give up on us.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.192
I'm doing it to protect you.

25:04.226 --> 25:06.125
My father is the king.

25:06.159 --> 25:08.992
He won't let anyone
interfere with his conquest.

25:09.025 --> 25:10.459
I'll find a way.

25:10.492 --> 25:13.226
They're going to marry me off
to the prince of moor.

25:13.626 --> 25:16.226
If you get in the way,
they'll kill you.

25:19.459 --> 25:22.226
I'd rather die loving you
than live without you.

25:24.059 --> 25:25.925
My heart can't handle
living a lie.

25:32.192 --> 25:33.459
How was that?

25:34.092 --> 25:35.326
Um...

25:35.359 --> 25:37.925
That was... That was great.

25:37.959 --> 25:40.492
Uh, not stiff at all that time.

25:41.059 --> 25:44.526
I need to...
I really... I need to go to bed.

25:44.559 --> 25:46.159
I have class tomorrow, so...

25:46.192 --> 25:48.059
Oh, that sounds amazing.

25:48.092 --> 25:49.892
Yeah,
you should try it sometime.

25:49.925 --> 25:52.226
I wish I could. I mean,
I'd love to go to college.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.959
Yeah, well...

25:54.559 --> 25:58.226
Hey, thanks for this.

25:58.259 --> 26:00.426
Seriously, you were great.

26:01.159 --> 26:02.925
Yeah, any time.

26:03.992 --> 26:05.459
Night, Francine.

26:15.259 --> 26:17.392
<i>As part
of your Irish studies class,</i>

26:17.426 --> 26:19.259
<i>you must complete
a service project</i>

26:19.292 --> 26:22.226
in order to see this country
from a different perspective.

26:22.259 --> 26:25.825
So, each one of you will be
adopting a senior citizen

26:25.858 --> 26:27.492
from one of the nearby
nursing homes.

26:27.526 --> 26:29.858
You will spend at least 20 hours

26:29.892 --> 26:31.259
with your new friend,

26:31.492 --> 26:34.959
and you will do what you can
to serve them during this time.

26:34.992 --> 26:36.392
At the end of the semester,

26:36.792 --> 26:39.059
you will be expected
to turn in an essay

26:39.092 --> 26:41.825
outlining what you have
learned from this experience.

27:05.159 --> 27:07.892
So, thank you so much
for coming down to help.

27:08.459 --> 27:10.025
You'll find her
right through here.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.825
Okay, thanks so much.

27:18.925 --> 27:20.925
- Hello, Mrs. Sweeney.
- Get out.

27:21.959 --> 27:23.992
Oh, I'm finely sinclair.

27:24.025 --> 27:26.459
I don't care if you're the
blessed virgin Mary. Get out!

27:26.492 --> 27:28.025
Um...

27:28.825 --> 27:32.192
Uh, I was actually...
I'm here from the college.

27:32.226 --> 27:33.402
I was assigned to you.
I'm just...

27:33.426 --> 27:35.226
I don't need schoolgirls
pestering me.

27:35.259 --> 27:37.992
I'll give you three seconds
to remove yourself.

27:38.025 --> 27:39.758
One, two, three.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.292
Nurse!

27:41.326 --> 27:42.392
Um...

27:42.426 --> 27:43.492
Nurse!

27:43.792 --> 27:45.292
- Nurse!
- No, it's okay.

27:45.326 --> 27:47.825
- I'll...
- What's going on here?

27:48.025 --> 27:49.326
I have an intruder.

27:51.792 --> 27:53.992
Don't you remember
our conversation, cathleen?

27:54.025 --> 27:58.092
What about? Me eating
more prunes?

27:58.125 --> 28:00.565
The one about you being civil
to people who come to visit you.

28:00.792 --> 28:02.226
I don't need any visitors.

28:02.259 --> 28:04.125
I didn't last year
or the year before,

28:04.159 --> 28:05.359
and I don't today.

28:05.392 --> 28:07.392
You know what?
I'm sure I can get reassigned.

28:07.426 --> 28:09.435
It was... I'm sorry.
It was really nice to meet you.

28:09.459 --> 28:12.092
But can't you just give me
some other old person?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.259
Please, I mean,
she's a crazy witch.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.435
If I reassign you, I'm then
gonna have to make allowances

28:16.459 --> 28:18.768
for all the other students. And
I'm not gonna deal with that.

28:18.792 --> 28:21.359
But she doesn't want me
or anyone else there. Please.

28:21.392 --> 28:23.025
The staff wouldn't have
assigned her

28:23.059 --> 28:24.339
a student if she didn't need it.

28:24.858 --> 28:26.459
Isn't there just a food bank

28:26.492 --> 28:28.925
or an orphanage
or just anything else?

28:28.959 --> 28:31.092
This is the assignment.
If you choose not to do it,

28:31.125 --> 28:32.858
you won't pass
your Irish studies class.

28:33.359 --> 28:35.925
I need to get
a good grade on this.

28:36.125 --> 28:39.125
Then you'll have to go
make broomsticks with the witch.

28:39.526 --> 28:40.858
Cheers.

28:59.459 --> 29:01.159
Hello again, Mrs. Sweeney.

29:01.192 --> 29:04.125
I think we got off
to a bad start the other day.

29:04.858 --> 29:05.959
How...

29:06.792 --> 29:08.792
How many times
do I have to tell you

29:08.825 --> 29:10.292
to leave this bloody room?

29:10.326 --> 29:12.792
Oh, I can't do that,
Mrs. Sweeney.

29:12.825 --> 29:14.825
But we're gonna be friends.

29:14.858 --> 29:16.359
I did bring <i>pride and prejudice.</i>

29:16.392 --> 29:18.192
I don't like Jane Austen.

29:18.226 --> 29:19.326
It's too bad.

29:19.359 --> 29:20.925
And I don't want

29:20.959 --> 29:23.426
to spend
all that remains of my life

29:23.459 --> 29:25.359
with the likes of yourself.

29:25.392 --> 29:29.059
Okay, you know what? I tried
to get out of this, but I can't.

29:29.092 --> 29:31.226
I was really hoping
for a sweet old granny,

29:31.259 --> 29:32.259
but I got stuck with you.

29:32.292 --> 29:34.359
So, now I have to do this
to get a good grade,

29:34.392 --> 29:36.858
so I can be good enough
to get into this music school.

29:36.892 --> 29:39.226
I have one last chance
to audition in three months.

29:39.259 --> 29:41.992
So, we're gonna be friends,
whether you like it or not!

29:42.025 --> 29:44.025
- Have you finished?
- Uh-hmm.

29:45.825 --> 29:49.426
If this is
what young people have come to,

29:49.459 --> 29:52.259
then the whole world is doomed.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.259
I'm calling the nurse.

29:55.292 --> 29:57.192
- Nurse!
- Okay. Well, I'm not leaving.

29:57.226 --> 29:58.226
Nurse!

29:58.459 --> 30:00.858
"It is a truth universally
acknowledged that a single man

30:00.892 --> 30:02.834
in possession of good fortune
must be in want of a wife."

30:02.858 --> 30:04.992
- Nurse where's the nurse?
- "However..."

30:05.192 --> 30:07.025
- Nurse!
- What's all this noise?

30:07.626 --> 30:10.326
She won't leave.
She's invading my privacy.

30:10.359 --> 30:12.359
I want to remove her at once!

30:17.792 --> 30:19.459
Did you enter
without her permission?

30:20.226 --> 30:21.459
Yeah. Yes.

30:21.492 --> 30:25.392
And did you refuse to leave when
Mrs. Sweeney asked you to do so?

30:25.426 --> 30:26.426
Yes.

30:28.492 --> 30:30.159
Good on you, young one.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.459
Cathleen,
you can shout all you like,

30:35.492 --> 30:36.992
but Finley's welcome to stay.

30:38.092 --> 30:39.492
Bye, ladies.

30:42.526 --> 30:44.025
If it's any consolation,

30:44.059 --> 30:45.825
this went much better
in my head.

30:46.959 --> 30:48.159
Hmm.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.326
"It is a truth
universally acknowledged

30:53.359 --> 30:56.359
that a single man in possession
of a good fortune must..."

31:14.025 --> 31:15.392
She calm down?

31:15.426 --> 31:16.858
Yeah, she fell asleep.

31:17.825 --> 31:19.459
I have to check on a resident.

31:19.492 --> 31:21.858
Do me a favor and pop this
into her top drawer.

31:21.892 --> 31:24.125
Cathleen always tells me
to throw her post away,

31:24.159 --> 31:25.959
but I know she just digs
these letters out

31:25.992 --> 31:27.392
of the bin and saves them.

31:27.426 --> 31:29.059
No idea what it's about.

31:54.925 --> 31:57.025
Hey, how was the nursing home?

31:57.059 --> 32:00.959
Well, that bitter old lady,
Mrs. Sweeney, really hates me.

32:00.992 --> 32:02.892
They've assigned you
cathleen sweeney?

32:02.925 --> 32:04.059
Uh-hmm.

32:04.092 --> 32:05.092
Who is this lady?

32:05.226 --> 32:08.392
I wanna meet her. I bet you
I could make her smile.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.825
Not a chance.

32:10.326 --> 32:12.359
Gather round!

32:12.392 --> 32:14.092
Fresh scones!

32:17.159 --> 32:18.959
Damn it!

32:18.992 --> 32:20.925
When are you going to learn?

32:22.359 --> 32:23.725
Try a scone, guys.

32:27.059 --> 32:28.192
Thanks, love.

32:28.226 --> 32:30.025
Brilliant, Mr. Callahan.

32:30.059 --> 32:32.259
Finally, something
we can agree on.

32:32.292 --> 32:33.825
How's the movie going?

32:33.858 --> 32:35.459
- I know Emma wants to know.
- Dad!

32:36.492 --> 32:38.092
Well, it wasn't going well

32:38.492 --> 32:40.226
until I started running lines
with Finley.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.092
Now the director
can't stop complimenting me.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.459
He says Steele markov
has come alive.

32:45.492 --> 32:46.492
Oh.

32:46.725 --> 32:49.226
Do you think we could run
my other lines, tonight, maybe?

32:49.259 --> 32:52.326
I really need to get
to my violin composition

32:52.359 --> 32:53.426
at some point.

32:53.459 --> 32:55.326
Well, I can work
around your schedule.

32:55.359 --> 32:58.025
I mean, if you want to come
to set after class or...

32:58.059 --> 32:59.892
Or we could work here?

32:59.925 --> 33:01.825
Uh, there's nothing special
about what I did.

33:01.858 --> 33:03.125
Anyone could have done it.

33:03.758 --> 33:05.992
- Thank you, Nora.
- Hey, do you think we can go

33:06.025 --> 33:07.268
to the cliffs
of moher this weekend?

33:07.292 --> 33:09.892
I am so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible.

33:09.925 --> 33:11.758
These scrapbookers
are here all weekend.

33:11.792 --> 33:13.359
- We can't leave.
- It's okay.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.192
Well, I could take you.

33:15.693 --> 33:19.858
Uh, no, I'll just go
with them when they can.

33:20.693 --> 33:23.892
All right. Let me know
if you change your mind.

33:31.326 --> 33:32.492
- Tom.
- Taken.

33:32.526 --> 33:33.892
- Francis.
- Taken.

33:33.925 --> 33:35.125
- Shaun.
- Taken.

33:35.159 --> 33:37.125
- Why?
- He has a micro scooter.

33:37.159 --> 33:38.025
- Does he?
- Yes.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.792
I can see the look in the eyes

33:39.825 --> 33:41.959
when young ladies
are thinking about the festival.

33:42.326 --> 33:44.059
I hear the fellas
are starting to ask.

33:44.092 --> 33:45.492
Molly runs the pub.

33:45.526 --> 33:47.259
- Oh, hi! Finley.
- Hey,

33:47.292 --> 33:48.892
it's where I met me husband.

33:48.925 --> 33:50.359
A magical night.

33:50.392 --> 33:51.392
See, it's like everyone.

33:51.426 --> 33:54.259
Hey. I've been asked
a couple of times.

33:54.758 --> 33:57.025
- Of course you have.
- You'll be there, Emma?

33:57.059 --> 34:01.059
I mean, I know it's been
difficult for you in the past.

34:01.092 --> 34:03.892
I mean, it was so sad, seeing
you alone last year, but...

34:03.925 --> 34:06.226
I mean, I can help you out,
if you want.

34:06.892 --> 34:10.025
But, I just got cast in
the new Beckett rush film,

34:10.059 --> 34:12.125
I just have to run on set
and shoot some things

34:12.159 --> 34:15.025
with Beckett and Taylor.
But I'll see you guys around.

34:16.259 --> 34:18.757
Get away from my shop,
you old drunk.

34:18.792 --> 34:21.059
- Come on.
- Relax, Aileen.

34:21.092 --> 34:23.059
- Run.
- I was gonna buy a book.

34:23.092 --> 34:25.092
Have you got any of those
romantic novels for sale?

34:25.492 --> 34:28.059
- Get out of here. Go.
- All right. I'll leave.

34:28.092 --> 34:30.292
But I won't come back here
buy me books here anymore.

34:30.326 --> 34:31.992
You're scaring my customers.

34:32.693 --> 34:37.259
Well, good afternoon,
young ladies.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.925
Any chance
of the price of a pint

34:39.958 --> 34:41.792
for a local struggling musician,

34:42.059 --> 34:44.125
who places his art
above all else?

34:44.159 --> 34:46.259
Look, I would, Seamus.
But I only have

34:46.292 --> 34:48.226
1.47 and a lollipop.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.292
Well, it's a start.

34:50.326 --> 34:53.059
Seamus, go sleep it off
in the back of the pub.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.525
You're right, Molly.

34:55.559 --> 34:57.526
Thanks, but no thanks.

34:57.559 --> 34:59.226
Ladies!

34:59.259 --> 35:01.292
Got to take care
of me best customer,

35:01.593 --> 35:04.125
and tonight's
musical entertainment.

35:04.159 --> 35:06.226
He's been napping here
in the streets for years.

35:06.559 --> 35:08.226
He's got a little cottage
up the road,

35:08.259 --> 35:10.092
but he rarely makes it
back there at night.

35:11.192 --> 35:13.326
What can you do? It's his life.

35:13.825 --> 35:16.359
He'd rather buy fiddles
than pay the bills.

35:16.392 --> 35:18.758
I better help him. Good luck!

35:44.992 --> 35:46.192
A convertible in Ireland?

35:47.259 --> 35:48.925
Yeah. I want to be ready

35:48.959 --> 35:51.292
for the three days
a year it doesn't rain.

35:51.326 --> 35:53.101
- What are you doing?
- I was actually looking

35:53.125 --> 35:54.526
for that cross.

35:54.559 --> 35:56.459
Oh, you're not
gonna find it here.

35:56.858 --> 35:59.758
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I already checked.

36:01.092 --> 36:03.392
Oh. Okay.

36:03.426 --> 36:05.125
But listen,
I'm a little worried about you

36:05.159 --> 36:06.959
hanging out
in graveyards like this.

36:06.992 --> 36:08.025
It's pretty creepy.

36:08.059 --> 36:09.392
So, I'm gonna offer you a deal.

36:09.758 --> 36:12.892
- Not interested.
- Just hear me out, okay.

36:12.925 --> 36:14.159
You help me with my lines,

36:14.192 --> 36:16.758
and I'll be
your personal tour guide.

36:16.792 --> 36:20.758
Show you all the sights
of Ireland. Huh? Come on.

36:20.792 --> 36:22.402
It'll help sweet Mrs. Callahan
feel less guilty

36:22.426 --> 36:23.858
that she can't take you around.

36:23.892 --> 36:25.025
Totally harmless.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.159
- Trust me.
- No, I don't.

36:27.359 --> 36:30.359
No, no, no, no.
I'm merely a humble tour guide.

36:30.392 --> 36:33.526
And for a limited time only,
I'm gonna offer you a free tour.

36:33.559 --> 36:35.226
Just to make sure you know
you're getting

36:35.259 --> 36:37.168
the better end of the deal.
So, come on. Let's go.

36:37.192 --> 36:38.825
I'm taking you
to the cliffs of moher.

36:38.858 --> 36:40.192
I can't. We can't go now.

36:40.226 --> 36:42.025
Don't you have
a photo shoot to do?

36:42.059 --> 36:44.359
No. I told them I had to help
my boring friend learn

36:44.392 --> 36:45.792
how to have some fun.

36:46.192 --> 36:47.925
Come on, Finley.

36:48.825 --> 36:50.025
Take a risk.

36:50.659 --> 36:53.025
You never know if
you're gonna have tomorrow.

36:58.226 --> 36:59.526
Okay.

37:10.959 --> 37:13.359
Here we are,
at the cliffs of moher.

37:15.159 --> 37:16.925
And what's that?

37:16.959 --> 37:19.825
This is my disguise, young lady.

37:19.858 --> 37:21.338
Pretty inconspicuous,
don't you think?

37:25.192 --> 37:26.792
Breathtaking cliffs ahead,

37:26.825 --> 37:28.825
and you're taking picture
of grass, come on.

37:28.858 --> 37:31.858
Well, there's not that much
of it in Brooklyn.

37:36.392 --> 37:38.992
Is that Beckett rush?

37:39.025 --> 37:41.359
I was hoping
for just one day without this.

37:41.892 --> 37:43.758
Can we please get a selfie?

37:43.792 --> 37:47.392
Johnny, don't you worry about
that nasty rash you have.

37:47.426 --> 37:48.326
I still love you.

37:48.359 --> 37:50.092
- What is she saying?
- Oh franny, my dear.

37:50.292 --> 37:51.992
Don't you think
we ought to get married?

37:52.025 --> 37:54.025
It's only right
after you gave me those twins

37:54.059 --> 37:55.959
at the ripe young age of 16.

37:55.992 --> 37:57.492
I'm an unwed mother?

37:57.526 --> 38:00.326
I'm a diseased baby daddy.
What do you want from me?

38:00.359 --> 38:01.992
Come on,
I think we should leave it.

38:02.025 --> 38:03.825
Okay, come on. Let's go.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.292
Okay, they're gone.

38:07.326 --> 38:09.858
You can let go of my hand now.

38:09.892 --> 38:12.892
You were holding on to me. Okay?

38:12.925 --> 38:15.059
Whatever. That was close.

38:15.092 --> 38:16.925
Thanks a lot for protecting me.

38:16.959 --> 38:18.459
No problem.

38:18.492 --> 38:21.226
So, what's the big deal
with these cliffs anyway?

38:21.259 --> 38:23.025
Just you wait.

38:23.059 --> 38:25.858
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.
Come on. Come on, come on.

38:27.492 --> 38:28.892
See.

38:28.925 --> 38:32.226
Now this...
This is Ireland. Huh?

38:32.259 --> 38:34.925
It's wild. It's amazing, it's...

38:35.125 --> 38:36.825
- Beautiful.
- I know.

38:42.292 --> 38:44.101
All right, come on.
There's better views up ahead.

38:44.125 --> 38:45.725
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

39:07.858 --> 39:09.492
Can I ask you
a personal question?

39:14.025 --> 39:17.426
Do you even really like
being a movie star?

39:19.992 --> 39:21.925
I mean, who wouldn't, right?

39:23.559 --> 39:25.292
It's not what I asked.

39:27.492 --> 39:29.959
What was it like
going to high school?

39:29.992 --> 39:31.292
It's...

39:31.326 --> 39:35.159
Grueling, and fun and weird,

39:35.192 --> 39:36.392
all at once.

39:38.159 --> 39:39.792
That sounds amazing.

39:40.192 --> 39:41.492
Oh, yeah.

39:41.526 --> 39:43.725
No, I mean it. You're lucky.

39:44.959 --> 39:47.125
Well, didn't you go
to school on set?

39:49.192 --> 39:50.925
Usually, it was just me.

39:51.426 --> 39:54.059
Sometimes, a few
other child actors and a tutor.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.725
But no prom.

39:57.792 --> 39:59.459
No graduation.

39:59.492 --> 40:01.959
No embarrassing gym class.

40:01.992 --> 40:03.892
Do you regret missing out
on that?

40:05.559 --> 40:07.259
I regret a lot of things.

40:12.459 --> 40:15.259
I bet those birds
don't regret anything, though?

40:17.192 --> 40:20.025
They're just... free.

40:22.192 --> 40:25.326
I don't know, I guess sometimes
I just miss blending in,

40:25.359 --> 40:27.858
being normal, you know.

40:37.092 --> 40:38.858
There's the real Beckett.

40:54.925 --> 40:58.459
Rolling, quiet,
no moving around, turn over

40:58.492 --> 41:01.125
three, two, one. Action!

41:01.159 --> 41:02.392
Wow!

41:09.359 --> 41:11.326
I'll have someone tell him
you're here.

41:13.292 --> 41:14.792
Oriana,

41:14.825 --> 41:17.992
it is not yet wise
to reveal your magical powers.

41:18.025 --> 41:19.259
Indeed.

41:19.292 --> 41:21.492
I will keep the men
until the time is right.

41:21.526 --> 41:23.259
Just like our love.

41:27.326 --> 41:29.092
Cut!

41:29.125 --> 41:30.159
Oh!

41:30.626 --> 41:34.025
Taylor, Beckett, really great.

41:34.059 --> 41:35.825
You are marvelous, my dear.

41:36.259 --> 41:40.259
Finley!
Hey, what are you doing here?

41:40.292 --> 41:43.758
Did you sneak onto set? I mean,
I'm not going to tell anybody.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.492
No. Beckett invited me.

41:45.526 --> 41:48.426
I wonder what my girl Taylor
will have to say about that.

41:48.459 --> 41:50.359
Finley! Hey!

41:50.392 --> 41:51.426
- Hey!
- You made it!

41:51.459 --> 41:53.092
So, what do you think?

41:53.125 --> 41:54.292
It's amazing.

41:54.326 --> 41:56.992
- Yeah.
- Hey babe, who's this?

41:57.858 --> 41:59.858
Finley, this is Taylor.

41:59.892 --> 42:02.459
Uh, she's here to help me out.

42:02.492 --> 42:04.259
Kind of like
an acting coach. So...

42:05.292 --> 42:07.159
How kind!

42:07.192 --> 42:11.259
Um, so, what other actors
have you worked with before?

42:12.025 --> 42:14.858
I actually haven't worked
with any other actors before.

42:14.892 --> 42:18.758
This is my first time on set,
but it seems pretty cool.

42:19.892 --> 42:21.459
She's a real natural though.

42:21.858 --> 42:23.192
Interesting.

42:25.259 --> 42:28.059
We should probably go run
the lines for the next scene.

42:28.092 --> 42:29.226
Come on, Finley, this way.

42:29.259 --> 42:31.392
It's a real honor
to meet you, Taylor.

42:31.426 --> 42:33.259
The pleasure is all mine.

42:34.059 --> 42:35.758
Come on, this side.

42:36.359 --> 42:38.392
Tired from working
on set all day?

42:38.426 --> 42:39.359
Me, no!

42:39.392 --> 42:42.959
I am perfectly fine
'cause I did nothing.

42:42.992 --> 42:45.992
Well, that's what
usually happens on a movie set.

42:46.025 --> 42:47.892
Nobody does anything. Oh!

42:47.925 --> 42:50.526
Uh, is this one
of your girlfriends?

42:50.559 --> 42:52.059
Yeah. No, it's...

42:52.092 --> 42:53.459
- Beckett!
- My manager.

42:53.492 --> 42:55.025
They got me
staying here tonight.

42:55.059 --> 42:58.226
My hotel suite won't be ready
until tomorrow.

42:58.259 --> 43:00.359
Oh, hello, and you are?

43:00.392 --> 43:02.226
Hey, Finley sinclair.

43:02.259 --> 43:04.858
I'm Beckett's father,
Montgomery.

43:04.892 --> 43:08.259
Oh! It's so nice to meet you.

43:08.292 --> 43:11.025
It is an absolute pleasure
to meet you.

43:11.059 --> 43:12.925
Did you get those scripts
I over-nighted?

43:12.959 --> 43:15.259
Yeah, the first two
<i>dawn of the dragon</i> spin-offs?

43:15.459 --> 43:17.159
You read them?

43:17.192 --> 43:19.426
Not yet. I've been kind of busy.

43:20.059 --> 43:22.226
Yeah, the studio is really,

43:22.259 --> 43:24.092
really, in love
with what you're doing on set.

43:24.125 --> 43:27.025
So, they made an official offer.
It's strong.

43:27.059 --> 43:28.392
Five movies over seven years.

43:28.593 --> 43:29.992
Oh!

43:32.526 --> 43:34.468
I don't know though. Don't you
think it's time to maybe

43:34.492 --> 43:35.925
branch out a little?

43:35.959 --> 43:38.059
To what?
We're building an empire here.

43:38.659 --> 43:40.925
To something that shows
what I can really do.

43:40.959 --> 43:43.326
I want to do something more
than just sword fighting and...

43:43.359 --> 43:45.292
Outrunning fireballs.

43:45.326 --> 43:48.426
Oh, but you're so good at it.
That's what the fans wanna see.

43:48.459 --> 43:50.292
Right? Isn't that right?

43:50.326 --> 43:52.758
You have a very small window
to capitalize on this.

43:53.025 --> 43:55.125
Yeah, I'll think about it,
for sure.

43:55.159 --> 43:56.992
Right now, we gotta cash in
on these sequels.

43:57.025 --> 43:59.302
So, hurry up and read those
scripts. All right. Let's do it.

43:59.326 --> 44:00.792
- Yeah, I will.
- Yeah.

44:01.326 --> 44:04.226
Do they come out
and get your bags here or...

44:04.259 --> 44:07.226
No. Don't worry,
I've got it, dad.

44:07.259 --> 44:08.925
Okay, great.

44:08.959 --> 44:11.392
So sorry to bore you
with all of that.

44:11.426 --> 44:13.359
I want to hear all about you.

44:13.392 --> 44:14.825
Where are you from?

44:14.858 --> 44:16.825
- Uh, New York.
- New York?

44:17.226 --> 44:18.226
The big apple.

44:22.125 --> 44:25.492
Good morning, Mrs. Sweeney.
And how are we today?

44:25.858 --> 44:27.359
I brought a twilight book.

44:27.659 --> 44:29.326
Who are you?

44:29.359 --> 44:31.992
Belinda did warn me that
you might pretend to be senile.

44:32.025 --> 44:34.392
I don't want the sun.

44:34.426 --> 44:35.792
Oh, that explains it.

44:35.825 --> 44:37.035
The vampires
have gotten to you, too.

44:37.059 --> 44:38.459
You'll really like this book.

44:38.492 --> 44:40.492
I'll decide what I like.

44:40.925 --> 44:43.059
"It was 75 degrees in Phoenix.

44:43.092 --> 44:46.025
The sky a perfect
cloudless blue.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.226
I was wearing my favorite shirt,
sleeveless..."

44:48.259 --> 44:50.159
It's cold. I want to go inside.

44:54.326 --> 44:56.492
You know, Mrs. Sweeney, um...

44:57.459 --> 44:59.025
Who's Fiona Doyle?

44:59.693 --> 45:02.326
What?
That's none of your business.

45:02.359 --> 45:03.435
Oh, yeah. I just... I thought

45:03.459 --> 45:06.159
that maybe I could help you
find the right address.

45:06.192 --> 45:07.725
I have the right address.

45:08.426 --> 45:11.159
- Then why...
- I don't want to discuss it.

45:11.858 --> 45:13.092
Okay.

45:13.758 --> 45:16.459
You've been snooping
in my drawers.

45:18.959 --> 45:20.059
Uh...

45:20.092 --> 45:21.192
What's up, ladies?

45:21.226 --> 45:23.492
Groovy day,
don't you think, man?

45:24.326 --> 45:25.858
Convincing.

45:25.892 --> 45:27.758
Do you need directions
to Woodstock?

45:27.792 --> 45:30.858
Whoa, sister!
Give peace a chance.

45:31.392 --> 45:34.359
Mrs. Sweeney,
this is Beckett rush.

45:34.392 --> 45:37.092
He's an actor in dragon movies.

45:37.125 --> 45:39.059
Mrs. Sweeney,
it's very lovely to meet you.

45:39.392 --> 45:41.459
I've heard a lot about you.

45:41.492 --> 45:44.359
Yes!
I've seen you on television.

45:44.992 --> 45:47.192
You're in love
with the Princess.

45:47.226 --> 45:50.025
Um, hey,
I brought you some treats

45:50.059 --> 45:52.202
because I know they're not
giving you the good stuff here.

45:52.226 --> 45:54.001
Although I know it's
nothing like your cooking.

45:54.025 --> 45:55.959
You're probably a wiz
in the kitchen.

45:55.992 --> 45:58.326
Baking is my specialty.

45:58.359 --> 46:00.459
Sugar and spice, my kinda lady.

46:02.559 --> 46:04.858
You really can't turn it off,
can you?

46:04.892 --> 46:07.025
There's nothing wrong
with spreading a little cheer.

46:07.226 --> 46:08.992
Come on, make love, not war.

46:09.359 --> 46:12.125
Tell me,
when did you start acting?

46:13.092 --> 46:16.192
I was seven years old.
My father got me into it.

46:16.226 --> 46:18.326
- No!
- Do you ever do any acting?

46:18.359 --> 46:19.426
Oh, yes.

46:19.459 --> 46:21.025
What was your first role?

46:21.059 --> 46:23.426
At school,
I played the white rabbit.

46:23.459 --> 46:24.792
The white rabbit.

46:24.825 --> 46:26.265
You look kinda like
the white rabbit.

46:27.959 --> 46:29.925
You're funny. You're a twit.

46:33.459 --> 46:35.125
Thank you so much.

46:36.092 --> 46:38.492
All right, thanks
for letting me stop by, guys.

46:38.526 --> 46:40.025
Okay. Peace out.

46:40.825 --> 46:41.825
Peace.

46:43.259 --> 46:45.125
He's a fine young man.

46:45.159 --> 46:46.392
He's a total player.

46:46.426 --> 46:47.992
Don't tell me,

46:48.025 --> 46:50.359
I don't know
what I'm talking about.

46:50.392 --> 46:52.259
He's a good boy.

46:52.292 --> 46:54.959
I can spot a bad one
a mile away.

46:54.992 --> 46:57.125
Now, carry on reading your book.

47:02.392 --> 47:03.825
"In the olympic peninsula

47:03.858 --> 47:05.192
of northwest Washington
state..."

47:10.292 --> 47:13.259
Thank god we've kept Beckett
hidden from them so far.

47:15.259 --> 47:16.292
Hey

47:16.792 --> 47:19.226
do you know much
about Mrs. Sweeney?

47:21.459 --> 47:24.992
I don't like to say things
if I've got nothing nice to say.

47:27.392 --> 47:30.426
Well, she's not that bad.

47:30.459 --> 47:32.059
No, she's not bad.

47:34.025 --> 47:35.259
She's terrible.

47:39.526 --> 47:41.459
So then, who's Fiona Doyle?

47:41.659 --> 47:43.292
Her sister.

47:43.326 --> 47:44.326
Oh.

47:44.825 --> 47:47.825
Mrs. Sweeney really wants
to get in touch with her.

47:48.925 --> 47:49.992
What happened there?

47:50.626 --> 47:54.392
I heard cathleen sweeney
stole her own sister's fiancÃ©.

47:56.326 --> 47:59.259
I mean, who would do
such a thing?

47:59.292 --> 48:00.426
I'm saying no more.

48:01.559 --> 48:05.359
Then, she left him, a few years
after they get married.

48:05.559 --> 48:07.326
He was heartbroken.

48:07.359 --> 48:09.792
They say he drank himself
to death not long after.

48:09.825 --> 48:11.259
That's it. I'm saying no more.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.459
But if Mrs. Sweeney
is the man stealer,

48:15.326 --> 48:18.359
then why is she
the one that's so bitter?

48:18.792 --> 48:21.159
Just getting what she deserved,
I guess.

48:45.992 --> 48:47.892
It's your friendly Irish
tour guide.

48:47.925 --> 48:48.959
Hey!

48:48.992 --> 48:50.326
Let's take this out
of your hands.

48:50.359 --> 48:52.326
Let's actually be
really careful with that.

48:52.359 --> 48:54.259
We don't really need it
because I have got

48:54.292 --> 48:56.858
the rest of the week off, and
it's time for your next tour.

48:56.892 --> 48:58.834
We're about to have ourselves
some real Irish fun.

48:58.858 --> 49:00.959
It's not a good idea
for me to be going out

49:00.992 --> 49:02.302
to one of your
exclusive nightclubs

49:02.326 --> 49:04.359
or whatever it is you do.

49:04.392 --> 49:06.159
And who says
that I'm into nightclubs?

49:06.192 --> 49:08.892
Uh, every tabloid in
the supermarket checkout line.

49:08.925 --> 49:11.092
Well, don't believe
everything you read.

49:11.125 --> 49:13.259
Beckett,
I really have to practice.

49:13.292 --> 49:16.092
Hey, as your tour guide, it's my
job to make sure you don't spend

49:16.125 --> 49:18.326
all of your time in Ireland
cooped up in this room.

49:18.359 --> 49:19.992
It's what you find
outside of this place

49:20.025 --> 49:22.892
that's gonna help you
write your try-out song.

49:23.326 --> 49:24.758
It's a composition.

49:24.792 --> 49:28.059
Whatever.
God, you are so uptight.

49:29.559 --> 49:30.992
No I'm not.

49:31.025 --> 49:32.459
Oh yeah, you kind of are.

49:36.825 --> 49:38.959
Fine. Where are we going?

49:40.259 --> 49:42.359
You will see, milady.
Come on, let's go.

49:42.392 --> 49:44.125
I'm not even dressed!

49:44.159 --> 49:46.259
No, you are perfect
just the way you are.

49:46.292 --> 49:48.092
Come on, let's go.
We're gonna be late.

49:48.125 --> 49:49.125
Wait.

49:49.292 --> 49:52.426
This is my favorite
place in all of Ireland.

49:52.459 --> 49:54.359
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

49:54.392 --> 49:55.825
Just trust me.

49:58.326 --> 50:01.459
Oh! Good golly, Mrs. Molly!
I've missed you!

50:01.492 --> 50:03.459
If it isn't me favorite fella!

50:03.492 --> 50:05.159
- Finley!
- Hi, Molly.

50:05.192 --> 50:07.526
Give everybody a round on me!
Drinks are on me!

50:09.992 --> 50:11.858
Cole, you stand guard
at the door.

50:11.892 --> 50:13.959
Make sure no reporters
get in here.

50:13.992 --> 50:16.858
Beckett rush rules! No pictures!

50:16.892 --> 50:18.492
These guys are great.

50:18.526 --> 50:19.758
Where's Seamus?

50:19.792 --> 50:21.792
He's already had a few pints.

50:25.426 --> 50:27.792
Looks like it's time
to wake him up then.

50:27.825 --> 50:30.292
Come on. You could learn
a thing or two from this guy.

50:30.326 --> 50:34.159
What am I gonna learn from him?
He's like, homeless, and...

50:35.226 --> 50:36.992
You'll see. Don't worry.

50:41.292 --> 50:43.226
Seamus!

50:43.725 --> 50:47.326
Oh Molly, let me just
crash here tonight, will you?

50:47.359 --> 50:49.326
Oh, you can crash
with me any time.

50:49.992 --> 50:52.492
Oh, it's you, boy.

50:52.526 --> 50:53.959
What do you want?

50:53.992 --> 50:55.292
Well, what do you think I want?

50:55.326 --> 50:56.959
I want you to get
this party started!

50:56.992 --> 50:58.268
I brought
this American girl here

50:58.292 --> 51:00.125
to show her some real Irish fun.

51:00.792 --> 51:01.959
We can do that.

51:22.825 --> 51:23.892
Whoo!

51:36.226 --> 51:37.359
He's great.

51:41.359 --> 51:42.925
Thank you, boys.

51:50.059 --> 51:52.125
I'm told we've got
a fine young Fiddler player

51:52.159 --> 51:53.492
here in the audience tonight.

51:53.526 --> 51:56.259
Can you go up
and give us a tune, please.

51:56.292 --> 51:59.825
No. I don't play fiddle.
I play the violin.

51:59.858 --> 52:01.825
Oh, fiddle, faddle, fuddle,
whatever you call it,

52:01.858 --> 52:04.226
it doesn't matter. Come on
up here and join us, lass.

52:04.259 --> 52:05.892
Oh, come on, go up there.

52:05.925 --> 52:07.492
- Come on.
- Come on, girl!

52:08.226 --> 52:09.725
We won't bite ya!

52:10.192 --> 52:11.326
Come on.

52:11.359 --> 52:13.192
Give her a round
of applause, everybody.

52:15.259 --> 52:16.992
I'm going to kill you.

52:17.025 --> 52:19.992
Yeah. That's fine.
Just after you play.

52:20.792 --> 52:23.326
Now, repeat after me.

52:43.925 --> 52:47.159
Now, you're in a pub in Ireland,
not in an orchestra.

52:47.192 --> 52:48.192
Enjoy yourself.

52:48.292 --> 52:50.259
Doesn't matter what your fingers
or the notes are.

52:50.292 --> 52:52.192
It's how you play them, right.

52:52.226 --> 52:54.892
Play them with your heart.
Play it like you feel it.

52:54.925 --> 52:56.292
If you feel it, they will.

52:56.326 --> 52:58.025
Do you love that instrument?

52:58.059 --> 52:59.992
- Yeah.
- Then show them you love it,

53:00.025 --> 53:02.101
and then you'll have them
wrapped around your finger.

53:02.125 --> 53:03.892
All right. Here we go, boys.

53:16.192 --> 53:17.426
That's it.

53:20.959 --> 53:22.092
All right.

53:50.192 --> 53:53.758
Hey! Well done! Well done, dear!

53:55.892 --> 53:58.226
Great stuff. Great stuff.

53:58.659 --> 54:00.092
Oh, you did great.

54:00.125 --> 54:01.868
I hope you'll come
and join us again next week.

54:01.892 --> 54:04.992
There's a Fiddler in there,
and we need to let her out.

54:05.025 --> 54:07.326
You know the name,
show what's inside in you.

54:07.359 --> 54:09.392
- What's your name?
- Finley sinclair.

54:09.426 --> 54:12.192
Finley.
Now that means "fair warrior".

54:12.226 --> 54:14.492
No wonder you were brave enough
to come on stage with us.

54:14.526 --> 54:17.392
Well, that's pretty interesting.
What's my name mean, Seamus?

54:17.426 --> 54:22.492
Beckett, it means, uh,
bee cottage or bee hive.

54:22.526 --> 54:23.958
Means you're probably descended

54:23.992 --> 54:25.792
from a long line
of irritating pests.

54:34.992 --> 54:36.326
And wow!

54:36.959 --> 54:39.192
That was absolutely amazing.

54:39.725 --> 54:41.925
I've never heard anything
like it.

54:41.959 --> 54:43.792
He plays
with everything he's got.

54:43.825 --> 54:45.359
Not bad for a homeless
old drunk, huh?

54:45.392 --> 54:47.159
I stand corrected.

54:47.192 --> 54:50.159
Wow, you are really beautiful
when you admit that I'm right.

54:51.492 --> 54:53.992
- Did you plan this?
- No, not at all.

54:55.259 --> 54:57.259
Okay. Maybe a little.

54:57.292 --> 54:59.059
Thank you. That was sweet.

54:59.092 --> 55:01.359
Sneaky, but still sweet.

55:01.392 --> 55:03.992
Finley sinclair,
you're actually not so bad

55:04.025 --> 55:05.392
when you decide
to have some fun.

55:05.426 --> 55:07.025
You're not so bad yourself.

55:07.059 --> 55:09.092
- But we can't get involved.
- No, definitely not.

55:09.125 --> 55:10.892
I couldn't possibly be
a good guy.

55:10.925 --> 55:12.226
And I'm trying
to be a good girl.

55:12.259 --> 55:13.925
And we don't
even like each other.

55:13.959 --> 55:15.359
We're just too different.

55:15.858 --> 55:17.459
It would never work.

55:18.925 --> 55:20.326
It'd be impossible.

55:39.858 --> 55:41.459
Wow! Thank you.

55:41.758 --> 55:43.959
That was actually a lot of fun.

55:46.825 --> 55:48.426
But, um,

55:48.459 --> 55:50.825
we should probably keep tonight
between you and me.

55:51.192 --> 55:53.359
I don't want you to get
dragged into the public eye.

55:53.392 --> 55:54.226
Of course,

55:54.259 --> 55:56.059
probably just another
meaningless kiss

55:56.092 --> 55:57.825
- for you anyway, so...
- No, it...

55:58.326 --> 55:59.758
It wasn't.

56:00.292 --> 56:01.392
Trust me.

56:03.925 --> 56:05.025
I don't.

56:09.059 --> 56:10.892
Goodnight, fair warrior.

56:10.925 --> 56:12.159
Goodnight, bee cottage.

56:24.192 --> 56:27.392
Get in here. I saw that!
What is going on with you two?

56:27.426 --> 56:29.959
You can't say anything
to anyone.

56:30.426 --> 56:33.925
You kissed him?
You did? You kissed him.

56:33.959 --> 56:36.758
I can't even barely still talk
to him, and you kissed him.

56:36.792 --> 56:39.059
- My sister kissed Beckett.
- Shh!

56:39.725 --> 56:42.359
Definitely keep this
from my parents.

56:42.559 --> 56:43.959
It's rather obvious.

56:44.192 --> 56:45.526
You two have been
all googly eyed

56:45.559 --> 56:47.159
for each other
the last few weeks.

56:47.492 --> 56:49.059
But I'll keep it classified.

56:49.092 --> 56:50.326
Especially from mom.

56:50.626 --> 56:52.359
What planet
do you think I live on?

56:52.392 --> 56:54.192
A blind man
could see that coming.

56:54.892 --> 56:57.459
Really, it's probably nothing.

56:57.492 --> 57:00.459
I mean, I don't even think
he meant anything by it.

57:00.892 --> 57:03.292
Either way, this can't get out.

57:03.326 --> 57:06.125
If it does, there's no way
he's still staying with us.

57:06.992 --> 57:09.459
And I don't want
any late-night shenanigans.

57:09.492 --> 57:11.092
Your mother would have my hide.

57:12.526 --> 57:14.092
Would you look at that?

57:15.559 --> 57:17.025
They look good together.

57:50.259 --> 57:51.526
Finley, I'm warning you.

57:51.559 --> 57:53.758
I'll go to work
if you don't have the money.

58:07.825 --> 58:09.125
You really showed him this time,

58:09.159 --> 58:11.359
still that dragon
won't be back in any hurt.

58:11.392 --> 58:13.426
Oh, you can say that again,
Arthur.

58:13.459 --> 58:15.899
Well, Steele, our dragon seems
to have struck a deal with them

58:16.159 --> 58:17.392
whereby they are...

58:17.626 --> 58:19.858
What? Arthur, what?

58:19.892 --> 58:20.992
Spit it out!

58:34.892 --> 58:36.025
This place is super cool,

58:36.059 --> 58:37.192
one of my favorite spots.

58:37.426 --> 58:39.125
You gotta go under
for good luck. Quick.

58:40.959 --> 58:45.025
Okay, so this is called
the 'miracle pride'.

58:48.159 --> 58:50.192
- You had fun today?
- Yes.

58:50.226 --> 58:51.758
So, what do you think about

58:51.792 --> 58:53.925
letting your tour guide
take you on a date?

58:54.426 --> 58:56.226
Seems harmless enough.

59:12.825 --> 59:14.359
Well, it was either this or fish

59:14.392 --> 59:16.426
and chips at the pub, so.

59:16.459 --> 59:18.326
Wow, this is so much better.

59:19.359 --> 59:21.326
How did you do all of this?

59:21.359 --> 59:23.426
Well, I had a little bit of help
from some friends.

59:23.459 --> 59:24.758
My lady.

59:25.792 --> 59:26.825
Hello.

59:26.858 --> 59:28.426
- Hi!
- There you go.

59:28.459 --> 59:29.526
Thank you so much, Ciara.

59:29.559 --> 59:31.059
You are very welcome.

59:31.092 --> 59:32.792
- Have a good night.
- Thank you, Ciara.

59:32.825 --> 59:33.992
See you guys.

59:36.426 --> 59:38.825
Well, bon appÃ©tit.

59:45.326 --> 59:47.226
You have to try this, okay.

59:47.259 --> 59:49.792
Just come here, come here.
Trust me.

59:52.125 --> 59:55.259
All right. Make sure
you're in there. Good?

59:55.292 --> 59:57.959
Yeah are you sure
you know what you're doing?

59:57.992 --> 01:00:00.426
Don't worry about it.
I grew up on these things, okay.

01:00:00.459 --> 01:00:03.892
Um, yeah, I... the problem is,
I'm just...

01:00:03.925 --> 01:00:05.426
I don't really like heights.

01:00:05.459 --> 01:00:07.125
Heights?

01:00:09.159 --> 01:00:10.725
Here I come.

01:00:13.259 --> 01:00:14.959
It's not so bad, is it?

01:00:14.992 --> 01:00:18.159
- Yes, it is.
- We're flying, Finley, come on.

01:00:19.959 --> 01:00:21.825
Oh, he's so good at this.

01:00:21.858 --> 01:00:23.925
I wonder why. Legs up, leg's up.

01:00:23.959 --> 01:00:25.526
Let it spin.

01:00:25.559 --> 01:00:28.059
There you go, you did it.

01:00:28.092 --> 01:00:30.092
Just don't look down.

01:00:30.125 --> 01:00:31.526
See.

01:00:43.059 --> 01:00:44.192
Okay.

01:00:44.226 --> 01:00:46.025
I got you. I got you.

01:00:47.159 --> 01:00:50.025
See, that wasn't so bad now,
was it?

01:00:50.059 --> 01:00:51.758
No, it was fun.

01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:58.226
So, what do you want to do
if you ever stopped acting?

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:00.959
It's a waste of time
to even think about it.

01:01:00.992 --> 01:01:02.758
It's not really
an option for me.

01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:05.392
Well, what if it were?

01:01:07.092 --> 01:01:10.125
Maybe go to college,
study history.

01:01:10.159 --> 01:01:12.492
I just want to live
a normal life for once.

01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:15.725
Wouldn't you miss
all your dragons?

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:32.725
My love, you're injured.

01:01:33.359 --> 01:01:36.725
It's only a flesh wound
from a dragon's claw.

01:01:37.192 --> 01:01:38.858
It will heal.

01:01:38.892 --> 01:01:41.159
I cannot say the same
for your father's castle.

01:01:41.192 --> 01:01:43.192
You have defended it valiantly.

01:01:44.858 --> 01:01:46.192
I believe in you.

01:01:47.259 --> 01:01:49.059
I believe in us.

01:01:49.092 --> 01:01:51.758
I will fight for your love
until the end of time.

01:01:53.025 --> 01:01:54.059
Cut!

01:01:55.159 --> 01:01:57.192
Print! Moving on!

01:02:00.259 --> 01:02:02.992
Taylor, very special.

01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:06.092
Thank you, my darling,
you my frame.

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:08.758
You are so money. Fantastic.

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.125
How did you do it?

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:15.125
You're 100% animal,
0% vegetable.

01:02:15.359 --> 01:02:16.359
Gorgeous.

01:02:19.892 --> 01:02:23.192
It's delicious.
You taste of victory.

01:02:23.792 --> 01:02:26.359
I need a little
sparkling water, please.

01:02:26.392 --> 01:02:28.326
I felt that, Beck.

01:02:28.359 --> 01:02:29.925
Thanks, tay.

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:31.292
You did great too.

01:02:33.025 --> 01:02:35.226
Very strong performance, son.

01:02:35.259 --> 01:02:36.259
Thanks, dad.

01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:39.992
They were crying at the monitor.

01:02:40.959 --> 01:02:42.426
Seriously.

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:43.925
Does that feel good?

01:02:43.959 --> 01:02:45.459
Yeah, it felt great.

01:02:45.492 --> 01:02:47.025
It should.

01:02:47.059 --> 01:02:49.392
Yeah, everyone's very
impressed with your work.

01:02:49.426 --> 01:02:50.866
You have a lot
of leverage right now.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.459
You should really sign
those contracts.

01:02:53.392 --> 01:02:54.758
I guess.

01:02:56.326 --> 01:02:58.959
Hey, you're trending.
Have you seen the article?

01:02:58.992 --> 01:03:00.259
No, I was busy.

01:03:00.292 --> 01:03:01.426
With your assistant?

01:03:01.459 --> 01:03:03.192
No. Just busy.

01:03:03.226 --> 01:03:05.192
Uh-hmm. Here it is.

01:03:05.725 --> 01:03:07.992
"Beckett rush
was spotted in Dublin."

01:03:08.025 --> 01:03:09.925
The heartthrob spent
the evening with two models

01:03:09.959 --> 01:03:12.959
at the exclusive emerald lounge
until Taylor risdale showed up,

01:03:12.992 --> 01:03:15.526
discovered the tryst,
and a cat fight broke out.

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:18.858
"R 'n r
is officially on the rocks."

01:03:18.892 --> 01:03:21.359
Yeah, and my name
is officially trashed again.

01:03:21.925 --> 01:03:24.059
Your movie sales
spiked five percent.

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:25.259
You should be thanking me.

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.426
So, you know,
things with the hippie guy

01:03:38.459 --> 01:03:40.959
are going interesting.

01:03:41.492 --> 01:03:45.858
Oh, and I'm still taking violin
lessons from Seamus. Of course,

01:03:45.892 --> 01:03:47.359
he calls it the fiddle.

01:03:47.392 --> 01:03:50.192
Oh, next time you come,
bring the fiddle.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:53.326
I'd like to hear
if you're any good.

01:03:54.559 --> 01:03:57.125
Yeah, I will.

01:04:04.025 --> 01:04:05.125
Um...

01:04:05.892 --> 01:04:06.925
Mrs. Sweeney,

01:04:06.959 --> 01:04:11.359
I heard about what happened

01:04:11.392 --> 01:04:13.192
between you and your sister.

01:04:16.092 --> 01:04:18.192
No, stay out of my business.

01:04:24.025 --> 01:04:25.025
Well...

01:04:26.192 --> 01:04:29.858
I mean,
you are just the grumpiest woman

01:04:29.892 --> 01:04:31.925
I have ever met
in my entire life.

01:04:31.959 --> 01:04:34.959
I know something, you know,
made you that way, right!

01:04:34.992 --> 01:04:39.426
And what they said you did is,
well, it's pretty shady but...

01:04:41.892 --> 01:04:44.326
No, no. You know what,
none of this makes sense.

01:04:44.359 --> 01:04:46.459
I know that you care
about Fiona,

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:48.426
so I'm gonna help you,
no matter what.

01:04:48.725 --> 01:04:50.292
I don't want your help.

01:04:50.326 --> 01:04:51.326
Leave me alone.

01:04:52.559 --> 01:04:54.092
What?

01:04:54.125 --> 01:04:55.392
I'm dying.

01:04:57.359 --> 01:04:58.725
What?

01:05:01.092 --> 01:05:02.226
Cancer.

01:05:03.226 --> 01:05:05.092
I've only awhile to live.

01:05:06.426 --> 01:05:08.392
Why didn't you say anything?

01:05:19.559 --> 01:05:21.092
<i>- Hey!
- You're late.</i>

01:05:21.359 --> 01:05:23.459
I know. But I just,
I came from Mrs. Sweeney and...

01:05:23.492 --> 01:05:25.259
Let's just run the lines, okay.

01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:26.292
Please.

01:05:27.892 --> 01:05:29.092
Okay.

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:32.259
Well, well, well,

01:05:32.292 --> 01:05:34.758
how is my son's lovely
assistant doing?

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:37.025
Um, I'm more
of an acting partner.

01:05:37.059 --> 01:05:39.125
Oh, I used to be an actor.

01:05:39.559 --> 01:05:42.292
I mean, things have changed
a lot since then.

01:05:42.326 --> 01:05:46.159
I think it's so kind
how you sacrificed so much

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:47.459
for Beckett's career.

01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:48.526
He was a natural.

01:05:48.758 --> 01:05:52.292
I mean, he needed to be in la
to make his dream a reality.

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:55.392
I don't ever remember saying
I wanted to be an actor.

01:05:55.426 --> 01:05:56.426
You did.

01:05:56.659 --> 01:05:59.259
"Dad, I want to be in movies"
is exactly what you said.

01:06:00.825 --> 01:06:01.825
I was six years old.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:04.892
I also said I wanted to be
an astronaut and a giraffe.

01:06:05.693 --> 01:06:08.226
Excuse me, Beckett,
they're ready for you on set.

01:06:12.959 --> 01:06:15.125
I'll be right back, okay.

01:06:15.159 --> 01:06:17.959
Actually, I need to leave too.

01:06:17.992 --> 01:06:20.925
I could really use your help
on this scene after we shoot.

01:06:21.825 --> 01:06:24.226
I need to do something
for Mrs. Sweeney.

01:06:24.259 --> 01:06:26.858
Beck, we need you on set.

01:06:26.892 --> 01:06:28.059
Yeah.

01:06:28.492 --> 01:06:29.758
Sorry.

01:06:40.825 --> 01:06:43.459
Finley. Hey!

01:06:45.192 --> 01:06:47.492
You seem like
a really nice girl.

01:06:47.526 --> 01:06:50.326
And I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

01:06:50.359 --> 01:06:53.092
This kind of thing happens
all the time.

01:06:54.526 --> 01:06:56.892
What do you mean by that?

01:06:57.459 --> 01:07:00.226
I just suggest you keep things
very professional with Beckett.

01:07:00.259 --> 01:07:02.226
He's with Taylor.

01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:04.426
Is he, that...

01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:07.758
I just... it doesn't really seem
like he is.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:10.092
No, they'll be back together
again very soon.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.858
Oh, okay.

01:07:12.892 --> 01:07:17.025
So, you manipulate his career
and his love life?

01:07:18.559 --> 01:07:22.025
His love life is his career.

01:07:22.059 --> 01:07:24.725
So, if you really care
about him...

01:07:26.092 --> 01:07:28.059
Don't get in the way.

01:07:49.992 --> 01:07:52.492
- Seamus! Seamus, wake up.
- Hey! No broom.

01:07:52.526 --> 01:07:54.292
No broom. Huh?

01:07:54.326 --> 01:07:55.792
Finley?

01:07:57.192 --> 01:07:58.925
What are you doing here?

01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:02.426
I need you to tell me
where Fiona Doyle lives.

01:08:03.192 --> 01:08:05.892
What are you doing
with those bickering old ladies?

01:08:05.925 --> 01:08:08.192
I need to help Mrs. Sweeney.

01:08:09.059 --> 01:08:10.292
Why?

01:08:10.326 --> 01:08:12.359
- No one else ever has.
- I know, I know.

01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:14.159
And that's what
I don't understand.

01:08:14.192 --> 01:08:16.825
Why does everyone
hate her so much?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:21.024
Cathleen sweeney.

01:08:21.758 --> 01:08:25.758
Cathleen
was an absolute stunner.

01:08:25.792 --> 01:08:27.758
She was the best-looking girl
in the town.

01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:29.426
And it was no surprise

01:08:29.459 --> 01:08:32.091
that she was able to lure
Charles sweeney

01:08:32.125 --> 01:08:34.059
away from her
sweet little sister.

01:08:34.492 --> 01:08:38.225
When he died shortly
after cathleen had left him,

01:08:38.658 --> 01:08:43.292
the whole town blamed her
and she had not a friend left.

01:08:43.593 --> 01:08:46.892
She was shunned by everybody,
even by her own family.

01:08:47.892 --> 01:08:51.758
Now, no one wants the opinion
of an old fiddle player.

01:08:51.792 --> 01:08:54.792
Between you and I,
I think there was more going on.

01:08:54.825 --> 01:08:57.359
It just didn't add up,
you know what I mean.

01:08:59.225 --> 01:09:00.925
Here, show me your map.

01:09:02.559 --> 01:09:03.992
Oh, I hate these things.

01:09:04.024 --> 01:09:05.059
Sorry.

01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:07.825
Look, she lives in a little farm

01:09:07.858 --> 01:09:09.259
just outside of town.

01:09:09.292 --> 01:09:11.858
Now it's a hell of a bicycle
ride up the hill,

01:09:11.892 --> 01:09:13.059
but you never know,

01:09:13.091 --> 01:09:15.192
we might be able
to figure something out.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.858
What time does Connor come by
to pick up the empty kegs?

01:09:17.892 --> 01:09:19.825
He said he'd be here
half an hour ago.

01:09:19.858 --> 01:09:21.059
He should be here any minute.

01:09:46.959 --> 01:09:48.024
Thanks.

01:10:02.559 --> 01:10:04.159
Have you come for the pig?

01:10:04.792 --> 01:10:05.526
Uh, no.

01:10:05.559 --> 01:10:07.492
Hi, I'm Finley sinclair.

01:10:07.526 --> 01:10:09.925
I'm a friend of your sister's.

01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:11.526
I don't have a sister.

01:10:11.559 --> 01:10:13.125
Please wait.

01:10:14.426 --> 01:10:16.825
Cathleen's dying of bone cancer.

01:10:17.959 --> 01:10:19.359
She doesn't have much time.

01:10:19.959 --> 01:10:21.892
She got what was coming to her.

01:10:22.559 --> 01:10:24.092
Did she make you come here?

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:26.792
No. She has no idea
that I'm here.

01:10:26.825 --> 01:10:28.959
Cathleen ceased to be my sister

01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:31.758
the moment she went
after that man.

01:10:31.792 --> 01:10:34.226
So now, good day to you.

01:10:43.959 --> 01:10:46.292
So, what? She's got only
a few weeks left to live?

01:10:46.326 --> 01:10:47.992
I just...
I don't know what to do.

01:10:48.025 --> 01:10:51.192
Now, miss sweeney won't talk,
and Fiona won't listen.

01:10:51.226 --> 01:10:53.125
So, I'm stuck.

01:10:54.559 --> 01:10:57.125
Our latest post just reached
a million likes.

01:10:57.825 --> 01:10:59.092
I forgave you.

01:11:01.559 --> 01:11:03.892
You know, it reminds me
of that picture

01:11:03.925 --> 01:11:05.992
we took in Paris
when we were 15.

01:11:06.392 --> 01:11:07.925
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:11:09.825 --> 01:11:13.292
Hey Beckett, Taylor,
they're ready for you on set.

01:11:13.326 --> 01:11:14.725
Thanks.

01:11:17.825 --> 01:11:20.025
Look, Finley,
can we just talk later?

01:11:20.593 --> 01:11:23.125
Yeah, of course, yeah.

01:11:24.526 --> 01:11:26.526
Hey, look at all these
articles about us.

01:11:26.559 --> 01:11:30.326
Beckett rushes back to risdale.
R 'n r returns.

01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:33.825
Beckett begs for Taylor
to come back, and she does.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.159
This is very good for us.

01:11:55.459 --> 01:11:56.925
Finley!

01:11:59.025 --> 01:12:00.925
Finley, I called you
like a hundred times.

01:12:00.959 --> 01:12:02.392
I'm trying to talk to you.

01:12:02.792 --> 01:12:04.825
I'm busy. Running.

01:12:04.858 --> 01:12:07.092
What? So, you just run away
when things get hard?

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:08.492
Not exactly a warrior.

01:12:08.526 --> 01:12:10.392
I thought it wasn't safe for you
to be out here

01:12:10.426 --> 01:12:12.992
- without a disguise.
- I'll be fine.

01:12:13.025 --> 01:12:14.892
Hey! We need to talk.

01:12:15.792 --> 01:12:17.725
- Please.
- About what?

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.445
You and Taylor hanging all over
each other on social media?

01:12:20.559 --> 01:12:22.226
I told you it's not
what it looks like.

01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:23.992
Okay, just trust me.

01:12:24.025 --> 01:12:25.992
Are you and Taylor
together or not?

01:12:34.359 --> 01:12:36.459
- Hey!
- Can we please have a picture?

01:12:36.492 --> 01:12:38.259
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:12:41.359 --> 01:12:42.959
- Thank you.
- All right.

01:12:43.326 --> 01:12:45.226
- Did everybody get one?
- Bye, thank you, bye.

01:12:45.259 --> 01:12:46.825
Thank you, guys, see ya.

01:12:47.292 --> 01:12:48.392
Finley!

01:12:49.059 --> 01:12:50.992
Finley. Finely.

01:12:51.426 --> 01:12:54.226
I'm trying to work through
all of this, okay.

01:12:54.259 --> 01:12:56.059
But this is bigger than just me.

01:12:56.092 --> 01:12:57.892
My life isn't always my own.

01:12:58.226 --> 01:13:01.226
I mean, my father,
he has an entire team of people

01:13:01.259 --> 01:13:02.892
organizing my public life.

01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:05.725
You just don't understand, okay.
I have no control.

01:13:07.059 --> 01:13:08.992
It doesn't answer my question.

01:13:09.626 --> 01:13:12.125
Are you and Taylor
together or not?

01:13:18.159 --> 01:13:20.925
Our first film together
didn't do so well.

01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:23.326
The studio was about to lose
a lot of money.

01:13:23.359 --> 01:13:27.092
And then, my dad came up
with this brilliant idea

01:13:27.125 --> 01:13:29.426
of a stormy relationship
between Taylor and I.

01:13:31.192 --> 01:13:33.459
It started with a lot of truth.
But then...

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.059
My dad just started
making things up.

01:13:36.092 --> 01:13:38.292
And before I knew it,
I had this whole other persona.

01:13:38.326 --> 01:13:41.326
The worst part of it is,
it worked.

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:43.226
It saved the film.

01:13:46.426 --> 01:13:47.992
So, it is all fake.

01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:56.526
I can't be with a guy who has
this entire made-up life.

01:13:56.559 --> 01:13:59.758
And I told you I can't do
anything about that right now.

01:14:06.892 --> 01:14:09.125
I've always wanted to ask a girl
to a dance.

01:14:09.159 --> 01:14:10.226
And this weekend,

01:14:10.259 --> 01:14:11.725
there's
the St. finian's festival.

01:14:11.992 --> 01:14:14.492
And I would love it
if you would come with me.

01:14:16.925 --> 01:14:18.059
In public?

01:14:18.326 --> 01:14:19.326
Yeah.

01:14:21.259 --> 01:14:22.459
No disguises?

01:14:22.492 --> 01:14:24.292
No disguises needed,

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:26.359
although
I am pretty good at them.

01:14:28.226 --> 01:14:31.758
But this time,
it would just be me and you.

01:14:37.326 --> 01:14:38.725
Okay.

01:14:41.792 --> 01:14:43.159
Here, let me get a picture.

01:14:45.359 --> 01:14:47.992
Okay.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:49.492
I'm good. Okay.

01:14:49.892 --> 01:14:53.426
And... smile.

01:14:53.459 --> 01:14:54.758
Emma!

01:15:07.192 --> 01:15:10.125
<i>âª When I woke up
as I was all alone âª</i>

01:15:10.159 --> 01:15:12.426
<i>âª hey-yah, hey-yah, hey âª</i>

01:15:12.459 --> 01:15:15.359
<i>âª with a broken heart
and a ticket home âª</i>

01:15:15.392 --> 01:15:17.125
Look, Emma and orla.

01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:19.059
<i>âª And I ask you now âª</i>

01:15:19.092 --> 01:15:20.992
<i>âª oh, what would you do âª</i>

01:15:21.025 --> 01:15:22.892
Are you sure?

01:15:22.925 --> 01:15:25.492
What are we doing standing here?
Let's go dance, come on.

01:15:25.526 --> 01:15:27.292
Come on, let's dance.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:32.159
<i>âª I've been
all over this world âª</i>

01:15:32.192 --> 01:15:35.925
<i>âª boys I ain't never seen
nothin' like a galway girl âª</i>

01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:37.825
Okay.

01:15:56.792 --> 01:15:57.992
Now folks,

01:15:58.025 --> 01:15:59.268
we're very fortunate
here tonight

01:15:59.292 --> 01:16:01.459
to have with us
a lovely American girl

01:16:01.492 --> 01:16:03.925
who's a very fine violin player.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.392
But I have seen her develop
over the last few months

01:16:06.426 --> 01:16:08.758
into becoming
a great Irish Fiddler.

01:16:08.792 --> 01:16:10.192
Finley, come up here

01:16:10.226 --> 01:16:11.468
and give them
something to dance to.

01:16:11.492 --> 01:16:13.192
Come on. Get up here.

01:16:21.092 --> 01:16:22.792
Let's go for it.

01:16:22.825 --> 01:16:24.326
Two, three, four.

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:34.292
Orla, come on.

01:16:47.192 --> 01:16:49.792
What a surprise to see you here
without Taylor.

01:16:49.825 --> 01:16:51.959
Yeah, you know,
I couldn't believe my luck

01:16:51.992 --> 01:16:53.492
when Finley said yes.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:55.892
She's pretty talented,
wouldn't you agree?

01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:58.359
Yeah. Indeed.

01:16:58.392 --> 01:17:02.059
Yeah, you know what.
You'll have to excuse me.

01:17:02.092 --> 01:17:04.426
I'm going to ask this young lady
for a dance.

01:17:07.092 --> 01:17:08.426
May I have this dance?

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:11.725
Yes, she says yes.

01:17:28.292 --> 01:17:29.492
Come on.

01:17:39.858 --> 01:17:41.492
Thank you, Seamus.

01:17:41.526 --> 01:17:43.825
They can hear your heart now.

01:17:45.326 --> 01:17:47.292
You better go back
to your fella.

01:17:47.326 --> 01:17:49.292
I can see
he's getting a bit lonely.

01:17:51.059 --> 01:17:53.025
- You wanna dance?
- Do you wanna dance?

01:17:53.059 --> 01:17:54.825
Ma'am, can I have this dance?

01:17:54.858 --> 01:17:56.359
Can I have this dance?

01:18:05.992 --> 01:18:08.992
Wow, now that was
a different girl up there.

01:18:09.025 --> 01:18:12.025
Well, thanks to
a certain Irish tour guide.

01:18:12.059 --> 01:18:14.525
No, no,
thanks to an old Irish busker

01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:16.959
who was the best teacher
she could ever ask for.

01:18:16.992 --> 01:18:19.792
So, how
is your Irish prom going?

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:22.858
Perfect, but there's
one thing I haven't done yet.

01:18:22.892 --> 01:18:23.959
What's that?

01:18:23.992 --> 01:18:27.059
Kiss a beautiful Fiddler
under a starry Irish night.

01:18:27.092 --> 01:18:29.925
Well, too bad,
I played the violin.

01:18:29.959 --> 01:18:31.192
Close enough.

01:19:01.559 --> 01:19:03.125
Um...

01:19:05.858 --> 01:19:08.025
About four years ago

01:19:10.025 --> 01:19:12.392
after my brother got back

01:19:12.426 --> 01:19:14.459
he was helping

01:19:14.492 --> 01:19:17.492
at this refugee center
in the middle east

01:19:19.792 --> 01:19:23.159
and, uh...

01:19:23.192 --> 01:19:25.825
I guess he was just...

01:19:25.858 --> 01:19:28.125
At the wrong place
at the wrong time.

01:19:31.025 --> 01:19:32.159
Oh.

01:19:34.792 --> 01:19:36.326
I'm so sorry.

01:19:36.959 --> 01:19:41.092
Alex had this peace
about him though.

01:19:42.992 --> 01:19:44.359
He was so alive.

01:19:45.292 --> 01:19:48.825
I know it's probably
a stupid idea, but, uh...

01:19:49.693 --> 01:19:52.992
I don't know, I thought
if I could come here

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:57.226
and see what he saw.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.159
I could find what he had.

01:20:03.159 --> 01:20:04.159
Sorry

01:20:04.392 --> 01:20:07.858
I didn't mean to drop all
of this on the dragon slayer.

01:20:07.892 --> 01:20:10.925
Hey, I'd like to think

01:20:10.959 --> 01:20:13.092
I'm a little bit
more than that by now.

01:20:16.159 --> 01:20:17.459
Yeah, you are.

01:20:37.226 --> 01:20:40.025
Hey, you guys want to know
where Beckett rush is staying?

01:20:40.259 --> 01:20:41.758
Yeah, sure.

01:20:45.892 --> 01:20:47.392
Oh, no!

01:20:47.426 --> 01:20:49.892
- That's him.
- That's him. He's coming.

01:20:54.858 --> 01:20:56.825
Beckett, who is this girl?

01:20:56.858 --> 01:20:58.259
Beckett?

01:21:04.358 --> 01:21:05.392
Is that your new girl?

01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:08.025
- What does Taylor think of this?
- Get out of here.

01:21:08.059 --> 01:21:10.025
Are you sure
you wouldn't like some tea?

01:21:10.059 --> 01:21:13.259
With BlackBerry scones.
Or biscuits.

01:21:13.758 --> 01:21:17.326
That's very kind of you,
but I think I lost my appetite.

01:21:17.359 --> 01:21:19.292
Taylor risdale is in my house.

01:21:20.059 --> 01:21:22.392
Do you think maybe we
should give them some privacy?

01:21:22.426 --> 01:21:24.492
Never! I've got to see this.

01:21:30.892 --> 01:21:31.892
It's ridiculous.

01:21:32.192 --> 01:21:35.426
You'd think they'd have enough
pictures of me already. Right?

01:21:35.459 --> 01:21:37.159
This is a mess!

01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.858
What the hell were you thinking?

01:21:38.892 --> 01:21:41.025
What do you mean?
We just went out for a night.

01:21:41.059 --> 01:21:42.892
What is so wrong with that?

01:21:42.925 --> 01:21:45.426
I'm trying to save his career
before he pisses it away!

01:21:45.459 --> 01:21:47.792
I'm trying to have a life
before you piss that away!

01:21:47.825 --> 01:21:50.192
All right, I think
it's time to go to bed.

01:21:50.226 --> 01:21:51.359
Long day.

01:21:51.392 --> 01:21:52.758
Emma, orla.

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:56.792
Tea is here if you want it.

01:21:56.825 --> 01:21:57.925
Good night.

01:22:03.858 --> 01:22:06.059
All right. This is how
I'm going to spin it, okay?

01:22:06.092 --> 01:22:07.159
Beckett rush crashes

01:22:07.192 --> 01:22:09.892
a small Irish festival
or whatever the hell it is.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.035
You have one too many drinks.

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:14.259
You make girls' dreams come true
by giving them kisses.

01:22:14.292 --> 01:22:16.858
That'll keep you wild, kind,
and still with Taylor.

01:22:16.892 --> 01:22:18.259
The fans will eat that up.

01:22:18.825 --> 01:22:21.925
How can you do this to him?
That's not who he is!

01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:23.292
And how long have you known him?

01:22:23.326 --> 01:22:25.092
You need to be quiet,
and step away

01:22:25.125 --> 01:22:26.892
from things
you know nothing about.

01:22:27.825 --> 01:22:30.758
Beckett, she doesn't know you
the way that I do.

01:22:30.792 --> 01:22:32.359
- He's just try...
- Finley.

01:22:32.392 --> 01:22:33.858
That's enough, okay?

01:22:33.892 --> 01:22:35.959
Son, you're the envy
of the world.

01:22:35.992 --> 01:22:37.226
Why wouldn't you want that?

01:22:37.259 --> 01:22:39.226
He just does this to please you.

01:22:39.259 --> 01:22:40.392
Can't you see that?

01:22:40.426 --> 01:22:42.258
He just wants
to have a normal life.

01:22:42.292 --> 01:22:46.059
- Maybe go to college.
- Finley, just... just stop!

01:22:50.792 --> 01:22:52.858
You know what,
maybe Taylor's right.

01:22:53.992 --> 01:22:55.992
Maybe you're never
gonna understand!

01:23:03.025 --> 01:23:04.392
You're just his puppet.

01:23:05.259 --> 01:23:07.492
You don't even have the balls
to stand up

01:23:07.526 --> 01:23:09.292
for who you really are.

01:23:10.825 --> 01:23:14.025
Hey, don't worry. Okay.

01:23:14.526 --> 01:23:17.225
She just can't understand
our life.

01:23:19.059 --> 01:23:20.459
It's for the best.

01:23:22.459 --> 01:23:25.059
Will you guys
just leave me alone right now?

01:23:31.959 --> 01:23:33.526
I'm telling you,

01:23:33.559 --> 01:23:35.858
I'm warning yous right now,
get out of here.

01:23:35.892 --> 01:23:37.259
The lot of ya.

01:23:43.892 --> 01:23:46.192
- Thanks so much, Nora.
- Well played, Nora.

01:23:47.858 --> 01:23:49.925
I really wish
I didn't have to leave you guys.

01:23:49.959 --> 01:23:51.167
But you're never gonna have
any peace

01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:52.825
with me staying here, so.

01:23:52.858 --> 01:23:53.858
We'll miss you.

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:56.068
But you know you can come back
and be my sous-chef anytime.

01:23:56.092 --> 01:23:57.359
Oh, Sean, I got you something.

01:24:03.426 --> 01:24:05.758
No more burnt hands, huh!

01:24:06.192 --> 01:24:07.459
I love them.

01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:09.992
Thanks, buddy.

01:24:10.392 --> 01:24:11.992
- Nora!
- Oh, sweetheart!

01:24:13.192 --> 01:24:15.025
I'm gonna miss you, guys.

01:24:36.792 --> 01:24:38.825
Beckett, let's take a walk.

01:24:39.159 --> 01:24:40.492
I'm sorry, I'm working.

01:24:41.025 --> 01:24:43.992
I don't care. Come with me. Now.

01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:52.925
Ciara, shenae, Logan,

01:24:52.959 --> 01:24:54.326
everyone down there,

01:24:54.359 --> 01:24:57.226
everyone in post
and marketing in la.

01:24:57.526 --> 01:24:58.602
All these people
are your friends

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.192
who work on the movie,
they're here because of you.

01:25:01.226 --> 01:25:02.326
They depend on you.

01:25:02.725 --> 01:25:04.192
Your movies sell,

01:25:04.226 --> 01:25:06.059
which provides
for their families.

01:25:06.092 --> 01:25:08.426
If you're not gonna do this
for you or for me,

01:25:08.459 --> 01:25:10.125
at least do it for them.

01:25:12.959 --> 01:25:14.192
And Taylor.

01:25:14.992 --> 01:25:17.892
You've grown up together.
You've been through a lot.

01:25:17.925 --> 01:25:20.426
She's the only person
on this planet

01:25:20.459 --> 01:25:23.025
who truly understands
what you've been through.

01:25:26.459 --> 01:25:28.925
It's just not like you
to betray people.

01:26:19.226 --> 01:26:20.825
I'm so sorry.

01:26:21.326 --> 01:26:23.059
It's fine, no. It's fine.

01:26:23.092 --> 01:26:25.059
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't matter.

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.925
It's fine. It's fine.

01:26:41.092 --> 01:26:44.092
- Hello!
- <i>Finley, it's me, Seamus.</i>

01:26:44.125 --> 01:26:45.226
Oh, hey, what's up?

01:26:45.259 --> 01:26:46.825
<i>Can you come down to the pub</i>

01:26:46.858 --> 01:26:48.092
<i>as soon as you can, please?</i>

01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:50.392
Uh... yeah, sure.

01:26:54.259 --> 01:26:55.392
Hey, guys.

01:26:55.426 --> 01:26:56.925
Ah, there you are, Finley.

01:26:57.825 --> 01:26:59.326
So what's up?

01:27:05.125 --> 01:27:06.725
Give him a chance.

01:27:07.559 --> 01:27:09.059
Thank you, Seamus.

01:27:12.125 --> 01:27:13.125
Hey!

01:27:14.959 --> 01:27:16.226
Sorry about all that.

01:27:16.259 --> 01:27:18.192
I just didn't think
you'd come if I called.

01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:22.125
I've been thinking about you.

01:27:23.426 --> 01:27:25.259
Your audition's next week.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:28.326
Yeah.

01:27:29.359 --> 01:27:30.492
Look, uh...

01:27:32.992 --> 01:27:34.392
I'm sorry about the other night.

01:27:35.092 --> 01:27:36.259
I screwed up.

01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:39.825
Please, just give me
a little bit more time,

01:27:39.858 --> 01:27:41.092
and I'll figure all this out.

01:27:44.825 --> 01:27:47.292
If you wanna live
this double life,

01:27:50.059 --> 01:27:51.925
I can't be a part of either one.

01:27:53.492 --> 01:27:55.725
Look, it's harder
than it looks, okay.

01:27:57.326 --> 01:27:59.025
I'm just trying to protect you.

01:27:59.992 --> 01:28:01.959
I don't want you to
expose yourself to the media,

01:28:01.992 --> 01:28:04.025
have your name dragged
through the mud like that?

01:28:04.059 --> 01:28:05.892
- Do you want that?
- Yes.

01:28:06.192 --> 01:28:08.326
If that's what it takes
to be real.

01:28:12.892 --> 01:28:15.392
It's not just about me, okay!

01:28:16.092 --> 01:28:18.192
I have a lot of people
depending on me,

01:28:18.226 --> 01:28:19.992
and I don't wanna let them down.

01:28:22.326 --> 01:28:23.725
Yeah.

01:28:25.259 --> 01:28:28.259
You know, Taylor was right.

01:28:28.292 --> 01:28:29.392
No.

01:28:29.426 --> 01:28:34.125
I don't know what I was thinking
that this could work.

01:28:34.159 --> 01:28:36.459
But we can, okay.

01:28:36.492 --> 01:28:38.025
Come on.

01:28:38.059 --> 01:28:39.359
We can.

01:28:40.292 --> 01:28:42.059
You just gotta trust me.

01:28:43.526 --> 01:28:45.226
I tried.

01:28:59.526 --> 01:29:01.492
I mean,
you're probably the first girl

01:29:01.526 --> 01:29:03.492
to ever break up
with Beckett rush.

01:29:06.792 --> 01:29:09.226
So why am I crying so much?

01:29:29.559 --> 01:29:31.259
You see, Finley,

01:29:31.292 --> 01:29:33.426
life rarely works out
the way we plan it.

01:29:33.825 --> 01:29:37.092
You've got to learn to play
the sorrow as well as the joy.

01:29:37.125 --> 01:29:40.059
They are linked,
like day and night.

01:29:40.092 --> 01:29:42.925
You can't have one
without the other.

01:29:42.959 --> 01:29:44.092
Give it a go.

01:29:59.426 --> 01:30:02.025
Very good. Good.

01:30:05.326 --> 01:30:07.292
Beautiful.

01:30:38.825 --> 01:30:43.492
Beckett's told me
you broke it off.

01:30:43.959 --> 01:30:45.459
Are you suffering?

01:30:47.526 --> 01:30:49.259
- You saw him?
- Uh-hmm.

01:30:53.226 --> 01:30:55.226
Make love, not war.

01:30:55.259 --> 01:30:56.959
Love, Beckett.

01:31:00.959 --> 01:31:02.159
Yeah.

01:31:03.925 --> 01:31:06.758
My little troubles seem petty
compared to yours.

01:31:06.792 --> 01:31:08.892
I asked you. I want to know.

01:31:09.359 --> 01:31:11.192
He's a good boy.

01:31:12.125 --> 01:31:13.192
Yeah.

01:31:15.792 --> 01:31:18.259
It's hard to change.

01:31:23.092 --> 01:31:25.125
Mrs. Sweeney...

01:31:27.559 --> 01:31:29.825
What really happened

01:31:29.858 --> 01:31:32.259
between you and your sister
all those years ago?

01:31:32.292 --> 01:31:34.292
I took my sister's fella.

01:31:34.659 --> 01:31:36.492
No, don't give me that.

01:31:36.526 --> 01:31:38.492
There has to be more to it.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.858
People would tell ya otherwise.

01:31:42.259 --> 01:31:43.758
Well...

01:31:45.359 --> 01:31:48.825
Being here in Ireland
has taught me to look deeper.

01:31:51.526 --> 01:31:53.426
Things aren't always
as they seem.

01:32:04.159 --> 01:32:06.359
My father was a gambler.

01:32:06.392 --> 01:32:11.025
He'd bet on anything,
horses, politics...

01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:13.758
The weather.

01:32:14.492 --> 01:32:19.059
Eventually,
we were about to lose our house.

01:32:19.092 --> 01:32:21.025
It would've killed my mother.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:26.392
She... it had been in her family
for generations.

01:32:26.858 --> 01:32:31.159
So, my father made a deal
with Mr. Sweeney

01:32:32.159 --> 01:32:34.858
which had a very high price.

01:32:37.426 --> 01:32:39.992
Our family name
meant something then.

01:32:40.025 --> 01:32:43.858
Charles sweeney had money,
but he had no social standing.

01:32:44.259 --> 01:32:48.025
My little sister
didn't have many suitors.

01:32:48.659 --> 01:32:53.125
So how did you end up
with Charles sweeney?

01:32:53.159 --> 01:32:55.758
When Charles sweeney drank,

01:32:56.059 --> 01:32:57.792
he got angry.

01:32:57.825 --> 01:32:59.025
He was violent.

01:33:01.192 --> 01:33:03.159
I had an eye for these things.

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:05.959
He was clever.

01:33:07.892 --> 01:33:10.892
He left bruises
where you couldn't see.

01:33:14.559 --> 01:33:17.825
So you took her place?

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:20.359
You were protecting her,
and she never knew.

01:33:20.659 --> 01:33:25.125
She thought
I took him for the money.

01:33:25.159 --> 01:33:29.059
My sister was blinded
with young love.

01:33:29.593 --> 01:33:31.858
How did Charles sweeney die?

01:33:34.925 --> 01:33:37.125
People said I killed him.

01:33:39.292 --> 01:33:40.892
Did you?

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:45.092
If wishes were bullets.

01:33:56.992 --> 01:33:59.025
Why didn't you just start over?

01:33:59.459 --> 01:34:01.459
When no one wants to hear,

01:34:01.693 --> 01:34:03.892
it's better to hide

01:34:05.392 --> 01:34:07.125
hide and be angry.

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:14.492
Well, didn't I wear my anger
like a grand fur coat!

01:34:15.426 --> 01:34:17.825
It all was for nothing.

01:34:20.359 --> 01:34:22.925
Wasted years!

01:34:22.959 --> 01:34:25.159
In the end, it's a choice,

01:34:25.192 --> 01:34:27.858
and I made the wrong one.

01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:18.492
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

01:35:18.526 --> 01:35:20.059
I need a favor.

01:35:20.593 --> 01:35:22.792
So, you called me first?

01:35:22.825 --> 01:35:25.392
<i>No. I tried everyone else.</i>

01:35:25.426 --> 01:35:26.858
<i>Last resort.</i>

01:35:26.892 --> 01:35:28.825
Okay, what's up?

01:35:28.858 --> 01:35:30.758
Mrs. Sweeney
told me the whole story.

01:35:30.792 --> 01:35:32.226
I have to get to Fiona's.

01:35:32.259 --> 01:35:33.925
Where are...

01:35:33.959 --> 01:35:36.292
Did you try riding up there
in this rain?

01:35:36.326 --> 01:35:37.359
<i>Maybe.</i>

01:35:37.392 --> 01:35:39.259
Perfect day for a convertible.

01:35:40.992 --> 01:35:42.392
All right, I'll be there.

01:35:57.459 --> 01:36:01.292
Hey, we really need
to talk to you.

01:36:01.326 --> 01:36:02.858
It's important.

01:36:02.892 --> 01:36:04.226
I have nothing to say to you.

01:36:04.259 --> 01:36:06.125
She's just trying to help, okay.

01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:07.892
Please, hear her out.

01:36:17.059 --> 01:36:18.392
Thank you.

01:36:18.426 --> 01:36:21.792
We just wanted to let you know

01:36:21.825 --> 01:36:24.725
that cathleen isn't expected
to live much longer.

01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:30.459
We've talked about
the past some, her regrets.

01:36:31.392 --> 01:36:34.492
How could you steal a man
away from your own sister?

01:36:35.359 --> 01:36:38.492
She tried to explain herself
in the letters.

01:36:40.426 --> 01:36:42.025
Did you ever even read them?

01:36:42.392 --> 01:36:43.492
Why would I?

01:36:43.526 --> 01:36:48.326
Miss Doyle, your sister
married Charles to protect you.

01:36:51.359 --> 01:36:53.492
He was physically abusive.

01:36:55.526 --> 01:36:58.326
How am I supposed
to believe all this?

01:36:58.359 --> 01:37:01.492
Cathleen begged your father
to drop the arrangement.

01:37:01.526 --> 01:37:04.159
But he was in too much debt,
and Charles was

01:37:04.559 --> 01:37:06.825
too dangerous to cross.

01:37:08.259 --> 01:37:10.825
It was so humiliating.

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:12.725
I'm really sorry about that.

01:37:14.892 --> 01:37:18.459
But your sister
has been shunned for decades

01:37:18.492 --> 01:37:20.159
for trying to help you,

01:37:20.192 --> 01:37:22.259
and you won't even open

01:37:22.292 --> 01:37:24.392
- the letters that she...
- Finley.

01:37:28.492 --> 01:37:33.025
Look, miss Doyle...
Your sister's dying wish

01:37:33.059 --> 01:37:35.359
is that she would
have your forgiveness.

01:37:36.392 --> 01:37:38.459
Please, just...

01:37:41.025 --> 01:37:43.092
Come and see her.

01:37:47.226 --> 01:37:50.392
I think you two
should be on your way now.

01:38:07.792 --> 01:38:09.125
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:38:09.159 --> 01:38:10.492
Come in.

01:38:11.392 --> 01:38:13.125
What's up?

01:38:13.159 --> 01:38:14.992
Nothing. How are ya?

01:38:15.892 --> 01:38:16.925
Pretty tired.

01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:18.059
Yeah.

01:38:18.925 --> 01:38:20.959
So...

01:38:21.892 --> 01:38:24.858
Are you seriously thinking about
not signing that contract?

01:38:29.259 --> 01:38:30.925
I don't know yet.

01:38:36.292 --> 01:38:37.426
Beck.

01:38:40.825 --> 01:38:45.426
Look, we...
Are in this together.

01:38:47.359 --> 01:38:51.959
You and me,
we've... we're linked.

01:38:52.392 --> 01:38:53.959
Always have been.

01:38:58.858 --> 01:39:02.025
What you do impacts me.

01:39:04.559 --> 01:39:06.426
Please don't do this.

01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:09.992
After everything
we've been through.

01:39:14.792 --> 01:39:16.159
We need this.

01:39:17.492 --> 01:39:18.492
Yeah.

01:39:23.892 --> 01:39:25.492
So, what are we supposed to do?

01:39:26.992 --> 01:39:30.326
Just sacrifice our whole lives?

01:39:31.559 --> 01:39:34.292
I don't know. It doesn't make
any sense to me.

01:39:37.125 --> 01:39:42.858
So few understand
this life that we made.

01:39:48.892 --> 01:39:51.426
Does she really know you
the way I do?

01:39:55.326 --> 01:39:56.992
Think about it.

01:40:00.492 --> 01:40:07.326
I'll be in my room,
if you wanna talk.

01:40:10.892 --> 01:40:12.326
Hey, tay.

01:40:13.259 --> 01:40:14.825
Yeah?

01:40:19.192 --> 01:40:21.059
Would you ride your bike
in the pouring rain

01:40:21.092 --> 01:40:22.725
just to help an old lady?

01:40:24.526 --> 01:40:26.192
Of course.

01:40:27.226 --> 01:40:29.092
But I wouldn't need to.

01:40:29.626 --> 01:40:31.959
Just hire a driver.

01:40:50.825 --> 01:40:52.725
<i>I leave for New York tomorrow.</i>

01:40:54.392 --> 01:40:58.025
It's crazy to think
that this one audition

01:40:58.059 --> 01:41:00.792
is gonna decide
the direction of my life.

01:41:02.392 --> 01:41:03.792
Yeah.

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:08.359
If you'd got
in the first time...

01:41:09.792 --> 01:41:12.159
You wouldn't be bugging me now.

01:41:13.959 --> 01:41:16.025
Yeah. I guess that's true.

01:41:16.059 --> 01:41:17.858
I'm glad you botched it.

01:41:22.825 --> 01:41:27.125
Mrs. Sweeney, I'm so sorry...

01:41:27.159 --> 01:41:30.359
That I couldn't get
your sister to come.

01:41:30.858 --> 01:41:34.292
I really tried.
I did everything that I could,

01:41:34.326 --> 01:41:36.526
but she just...
She wouldn't listen.

01:41:36.559 --> 01:41:38.459
I trust you did.

01:41:41.426 --> 01:41:43.492
With everything that you did

01:41:43.992 --> 01:41:45.959
for your father and your sister,

01:41:45.992 --> 01:41:48.892
you are the bravest person
I've ever met.

01:41:48.925 --> 01:41:50.426
You obviously
haven't met many people.

01:41:50.792 --> 01:41:52.426
Just shut up.

01:41:56.025 --> 01:41:58.959
You wouldn't have said that
a few months ago.

01:42:00.792 --> 01:42:02.492
Yeah, well...

01:42:02.526 --> 01:42:05.459
I guess Ireland
is just full of surprises.

01:42:06.059 --> 01:42:07.292
Fact.

01:42:08.858 --> 01:42:10.825
Bye, sweetheart.

01:42:10.858 --> 01:42:12.792
Wind in your sails.

01:42:33.426 --> 01:42:34.992
Can I have a word?

01:42:45.959 --> 01:42:48.125
I'm not signing that contract.

01:42:52.892 --> 01:42:54.326
Here's the deal.

01:42:56.292 --> 01:43:00.992
I'll do one more film
in the next six months.

01:43:01.025 --> 01:43:03.326
And I don't care
how much money I make.

01:43:03.925 --> 01:43:07.426
I'm not doing this for me
or for you.

01:43:07.459 --> 01:43:09.226
I'm doing this
for the cast and crew

01:43:09.259 --> 01:43:11.892
so they can prepare for life
after Steele markov.

01:43:12.725 --> 01:43:16.725
That's my offer.
Take it or leave it.

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:21.825
As your manager...

01:43:22.892 --> 01:43:24.925
I have to warn you that this is

01:43:24.959 --> 01:43:27.725
the most asinine thing
you've ever done.

01:43:31.858 --> 01:43:34.025
I don't need a manager
right now.

01:43:34.492 --> 01:43:36.159
I need a father.

01:44:14.459 --> 01:44:17.326
So you think it's good enough?

01:44:17.959 --> 01:44:21.192
You are ready for your audition.

01:44:23.459 --> 01:44:26.392
Thank you, Seamus,
for everything.

01:44:26.825 --> 01:44:30.059
Now go and make them
stuck up music professors

01:44:30.092 --> 01:44:31.792
tap their feet.

01:44:32.259 --> 01:44:33.459
I will.

01:44:50.526 --> 01:44:53.259
That's okay, I'll get it.
Emma, you take that.

01:44:54.092 --> 01:44:56.326
Here's some soda bread
to bring to your mom.

01:44:56.359 --> 01:44:58.858
We would have made more,
but we've been so busy.

01:44:58.892 --> 01:45:00.025
Nonstop calls from people

01:45:00.059 --> 01:45:02.059
wanting to stay
in Beckett's room.

01:45:02.092 --> 01:45:03.426
Imagine that.

01:45:13.359 --> 01:45:15.359
Hello!

01:45:15.392 --> 01:45:16.825
Oh, hey. What's up?

01:45:23.326 --> 01:45:25.259
Did her sister ever come?

01:45:26.959 --> 01:45:28.492
So she's all alone?

01:45:58.992 --> 01:46:00.459
I have to go back.

01:46:01.459 --> 01:46:03.459
Did you forget something?

01:46:03.492 --> 01:46:05.159
What's wrong?

01:46:06.959 --> 01:46:08.925
I need to be somewhere else.

01:46:11.992 --> 01:46:13.892
Are you sure, Finley?

01:46:18.059 --> 01:46:19.426
Yeah.

01:46:47.259 --> 01:46:48.892
Am I too late?

01:46:49.359 --> 01:46:52.492
No. You're just in time.

01:46:55.059 --> 01:46:59.326
Cathleen, your sister's here.

01:47:06.492 --> 01:47:08.025
Cath.

01:47:09.925 --> 01:47:10.925
Fi.

01:47:11.792 --> 01:47:14.925
Oh, my god, Fiona.

01:47:20.892 --> 01:47:22.159
We're old.

01:47:25.492 --> 01:47:26.858
Yeah.

01:47:29.159 --> 01:47:31.226
Where's...?

01:47:32.192 --> 01:47:36.459
Finley, come and sit with us.

01:47:49.925 --> 01:47:50.925
Fi.

01:47:55.259 --> 01:47:57.226
We're okay now.

01:48:59.192 --> 01:49:00.226
Oh, my!

01:51:03.858 --> 01:51:07.092
So, you're back in town.

01:51:07.725 --> 01:51:10.892
Still driving this
ridiculous convertible, I see.

01:51:10.925 --> 01:51:13.226
Yeah, I'm all ready
for the next sunny day...

01:51:13.626 --> 01:51:15.025
In two months.

01:51:18.426 --> 01:51:21.125
I went to that cemetery.

01:51:22.825 --> 01:51:24.426
I told you I'd find it.

01:51:24.459 --> 01:51:25.959
Thank you, Beckett.

01:51:25.992 --> 01:51:27.092
Sorry it took me so long.

01:51:27.125 --> 01:51:30.092
I had to search everyone
within a hundred miles of here.

01:51:30.125 --> 01:51:33.125
I guess I was wrong.
Maybe I can trust you.

01:51:33.758 --> 01:51:35.226
Well, you still look gorgeous

01:51:35.259 --> 01:51:37.025
when you admit
that you're wrong.

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:40.892
So, what did you find?

01:51:40.925 --> 01:51:45.792
Well, four years ago,
my brother drew this picture

01:51:46.326 --> 01:51:49.025
for this moment
when I needed it most.

01:51:49.693 --> 01:51:54.392
I couldn't see it then, but...
I was never alone.

01:51:56.526 --> 01:51:58.992
Well, sometimes things
aren't always as they seem.

01:52:02.292 --> 01:52:03.892
So...

01:52:05.192 --> 01:52:06.758
I didn't sign the contract.

01:52:07.792 --> 01:52:08.792
What?

01:52:09.059 --> 01:52:11.101
I'm going to do one more movie
just to help everybody out,

01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:14.426
but then next fall,
I'm going to college.

01:52:14.459 --> 01:52:18.426
Well, girls' hearts will be
shattered all over the world.

01:52:18.459 --> 01:52:21.426
Well, there's only one girl's
heart that I care about.

01:52:23.226 --> 01:52:25.025
No more double-life either.

01:52:25.559 --> 01:52:28.159
Tomorrow, a story's going to hit
social media,

01:52:28.192 --> 01:52:30.892
telling the world
that Taylor and I are done.

01:52:31.092 --> 01:52:32.092
Finally!

01:52:33.825 --> 01:52:35.292
I'm happy about it

01:52:37.159 --> 01:52:39.392
because there's a fair warrior
I wanna try and win back.

01:52:54.025 --> 01:52:55.892
<i>I finished the last few weeks</i>

01:52:55.925 --> 01:52:57.365
<i>of my exchange program
and went home.</i>

01:52:58.125 --> 01:52:59.792
Where is it?

01:52:59.825 --> 01:53:02.226
<i>I told the conservatory
about Mrs. Sweeney,</i>

01:53:02.259 --> 01:53:04.959
<i>and they allowed me to
audition after the deadline,</i>

01:53:04.992 --> 01:53:06.226
<i>one final time.</i>

01:53:43.892 --> 01:53:45.125
<i>I was accepted.</i>

01:53:48.825 --> 01:53:50.259
<i>Beckett visited.</i>

01:53:50.292 --> 01:53:52.892
<i>And of course, we crashed
my old high school's prom.</i>

01:54:00.492 --> 01:54:02.326
<i>That summer,
I went back to Ireland</i>

01:54:05.025 --> 01:54:06.426
<i>and helped Beckett
with his lines</i>

01:54:06.459 --> 01:54:07.725
<i>on his last</i> dragon <i>film.</i>

01:54:11.092 --> 01:54:13.025
<i>Beckett began college
in New York.</i>

01:54:13.059 --> 01:54:14.825
<i>He's trying to be a normal guy,</i>

01:54:14.858 --> 01:54:16.359
<i>but he still needs
his disguises.</i>

01:54:19.492 --> 01:54:21.792
<i>And, in Autumn,
at the conservatory,</i>

01:54:21.825 --> 01:54:22.992
<i>I played the violin.</i>

01:54:23.392 --> 01:54:25.825
<i>Or fiddle, as Seamus would say.</i>
