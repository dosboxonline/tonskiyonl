02:06.791 --> 02:09.002
Just tell him, damn it!

02:09.210 --> 02:11.370
Tell him to give him coffee.
You tell him!

02:11.379 --> 02:12.296
Give me that!

02:13.172 --> 02:15.717
Look, get him
some coffee or cookies.

02:53.171 --> 02:54.130
I know that!

04:42.530 --> 04:43.448
Hey!

04:43.698 --> 04:46.075
Where do you think you're going?

04:46.492 --> 04:48.202
Going home.

05:33.831 --> 05:35.208
Officer.

05:35.416 --> 05:39.754
The guy walked into the bushes,
maybe to pee, but he never came back.

05:40.004 --> 05:41.464
Do you need help?

05:42.048 --> 05:43.299
Do you own this car?

05:43.549 --> 05:46.219
That's not him.
The guy walked into the bushes.

05:46.469 --> 05:48.096
He said he was going home.

05:48.471 --> 05:49.555
Going home?

05:50.306 --> 05:52.433
Gentlemen, return to your cars.

05:52.684 --> 05:53.851
What about the car?

05:54.394 --> 05:56.187
I'll radio for a tow truck.

05:56.437 --> 05:59.732
Let's shove it out of
the way. We'll get this lane moving!

06:00.441 --> 06:01.693
It's dangerous.

06:01.984 --> 06:06.197
We got a lot of glass and steel
rushing by us at high speeds.

06:07.323 --> 06:08.408
Wait a minute.

06:09.409 --> 06:13.079
Prendergast. Downtown Robbery.
Let's go.

06:13.329 --> 06:15.039
I'm in linoleum tile, myself.

06:15.248 --> 06:18.167
All right.
You, back in your vehicle.

06:18.376 --> 06:20.420
You push. I'll steer.

06:23.339 --> 06:26.884
We do ceramics too.
Speciai discount for law officers.

06:27.135 --> 06:31.806
I love Cops, the TV show.
Don't you watch it? I never miss it.

06:32.098 --> 06:33.558
You're lucky you caught me.

06:33.808 --> 06:34.767
I am?

06:35.018 --> 06:37.395
Today's my last day as a cop.

06:38.604 --> 06:39.856
Lucky me.

06:42.859 --> 06:44.110
Don't touch it!

06:44.402 --> 06:47.071
Don't touch it!
Just get this lane moving.

06:47.321 --> 06:49.198
Okay. Sorry.

06:51.284 --> 06:52.535
Officer?

06:54.579 --> 06:55.580
Officer?

07:07.425 --> 07:09.135
Oh, my God! The phone!

07:10.428 --> 07:11.888
Come on, baby.

07:15.308 --> 07:16.851
Watch your fingers.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.228
Take Tucker, okay?

07:25.234 --> 07:26.194
Hello?

07:27.570 --> 07:29.030
Mom?

07:29.405 --> 07:30.239
Hello?

07:30.490 --> 07:33.368
Mom, can you help me open this?

07:35.995 --> 07:36.829
Hello?

08:18.287 --> 08:20.665
Can I get some change
for the phone, please?

08:21.374 --> 08:23.668
No change. Have to buy something.

09:11.632 --> 09:14.010
Eighty-fie sen.
What?

09:14.260 --> 09:15.595
Eighty-fie sen.

09:16.262 --> 09:19.015
I don't understand.
Eighty-fie sen!

09:20.350 --> 09:22.352
Eighty-five cents?

09:23.227 --> 09:26.189
It doesn't give me enough money
for the phone call.

09:29.817 --> 09:33.237
I'll give you 50 cents.
You give me 50 cents change.

09:33.488 --> 09:36.199
No way.
Yes, way.

09:36.908 --> 09:39.285
Drink, eighty-fie sen.
You pay or go!

09:39.744 --> 09:43.498
I don't understand "fie."
There's a "V" in the word "five."

09:43.706 --> 09:44.874
No "V's" in China?

09:45.249 --> 09:47.794
Not Chinese. I'm Korean.
Whatever.

09:48.044 --> 09:52.674
You come to my country, take my money
and don't even learn my language?

09:55.635 --> 09:57.470
You're Korean?

09:57.970 --> 10:02.433
Do you have any idea how much money
my country has given your country?

10:02.767 --> 10:03.768
How much?

10:05.895 --> 10:08.940
I don't know. It's a lot.
You can bet on that.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.567
You go now! No trouble!

10:14.404 --> 10:16.030
I stay.

10:16.614 --> 10:18.074
What do you think of that?

10:36.092 --> 10:37.093
Jesus Christ!

10:37.552 --> 10:38.386
What is this?

10:39.262 --> 10:41.222
The last stand on Fiji?

10:43.433 --> 10:45.268
Take the money! Take the money!
What?

10:45.518 --> 10:46.769
Take the money.

10:47.020 --> 10:50.148
Take your hands away from your--
I can't under-- Stop it!

10:51.607 --> 10:55.028
All right.
Speak slowly and distinctly.

10:55.236 --> 10:56.571
Take the money.

11:01.951 --> 11:04.829
You think I'm a thief?

11:06.873 --> 11:09.417
You see, I'm not the thief.

11:09.709 --> 11:12.670
I'm not the one charging 85 cents
for a stinking soda!

11:12.920 --> 11:14.422
You're the thief!

11:17.842 --> 11:21.679
I'm just standing up
for my rights as a consumer.

11:24.098 --> 11:27.435
I'm rolling back prices to 1965.
What do you think of that?

11:31.397 --> 11:34.150
Doughnuts. Package of six.
How much?

11:34.859 --> 11:35.693
$1.12.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.031
Too much.

11:43.368 --> 11:45.078
Aspirin. Price?

11:45.578 --> 11:46.537
$3.40.

11:47.121 --> 11:48.289
Oh, please!

11:54.545 --> 11:57.173
AA batteries. Package of four.

11:59.759 --> 12:00.927
$4.29.

12:02.470 --> 12:04.263
Nice try.

12:04.722 --> 12:06.808
This whole shelf looks suspect.

12:19.904 --> 12:21.823
One soda...

12:22.031 --> 12:23.408
...12 ounces.

12:25.201 --> 12:26.452
Fifty sen!

12:29.664 --> 12:31.165
Sold.

12:48.933 --> 12:51.728
It's been a pleasure
frequenting your establishment.

13:02.739 --> 13:04.198
Very funny.

13:04.407 --> 13:06.409
Very, very funny.

13:06.826 --> 13:10.163
Genuine Arizona sand,
Prendergast. Get used to it.

13:10.371 --> 13:11.205
I bet.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.958
Genuine Santa Monica sand's
more like it.

13:14.208 --> 13:18.421
It's from my cat's litterbox,
but he said you could keep the lumps.

13:21.716 --> 13:23.343
You took my stuff out first?

13:23.593 --> 13:25.261
Heck, no. How fun would that be?

13:25.470 --> 13:29.307
How do I get a pen out?
Don't need no pen. Use the cat turd.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.313
It's your last day. Be careful.
Remember Forsythe?

13:36.105 --> 13:39.275
Forsythe got 5 minutes to retirement.
Two!

13:39.525 --> 13:43.196
Two minutes, nothing! The guy was
on the way to his fucking car.

13:43.488 --> 13:46.741
Mowed down by a runaway impound.
Nasty.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.743
Ironic.
Ironic as fuck!

13:48.951 --> 13:50.912
Anything can happen today.

13:51.245 --> 13:53.706
You know how dangerous a desk can be.

13:53.998 --> 13:56.459
Watch out for paper cuts.

13:57.335 --> 13:58.419
Funny, funny, funny.

13:58.628 --> 14:01.422
Sorry.
I tried to dissuade them.

14:01.673 --> 14:05.218
Hey, Sandra.
It's obligatory, I guess.

14:06.010 --> 14:09.555
Now, what else do they
have up their sleeve?

14:10.306 --> 14:11.391
Nothing.

14:11.724 --> 14:12.558
Nothing?

14:14.227 --> 14:17.522
Are we still on for lunch?
You're not going home early?

14:17.814 --> 14:19.065
Why would I go home early?

14:19.691 --> 14:21.150
Last day and all.

14:21.401 --> 14:22.777
I'm not superstitious.

14:23.027 --> 14:25.238
Sandy, you ready?
In a minute.

14:25.446 --> 14:27.907
Leave the poor desk jockey alone.

14:28.116 --> 14:29.992
See if you know how to start the car.

14:30.618 --> 14:33.579
Let's not get
our pantyhose in a bind.

14:34.455 --> 14:36.082
I'll miss you, Prendergast.

14:36.791 --> 14:39.168
You really will? Me too.

14:40.503 --> 14:41.754
Come on, let's go!

14:42.171 --> 14:43.589
Lunch?

15:07.030 --> 15:08.656
Just a second, baby.

15:09.615 --> 15:11.826
When will we make
the strawberry cake?

15:12.076 --> 15:14.454
Soon. I thought
sundown would be good.

15:14.704 --> 15:16.539
Here. Not in the house.

15:17.123 --> 15:20.710
Just a few kids. I didn't want
to do a whole big thing.

15:58.289 --> 15:59.374
Prendergast here.

15:59.749 --> 16:01.417
Hi.
Hello?

16:01.668 --> 16:03.670
It's me.
Hi.

16:04.921 --> 16:08.049
I wish you were home.
Wouldn't you come home now?

16:08.549 --> 16:09.926
What's wrong?

16:10.635 --> 16:11.719
I don 't know.

16:12.637 --> 16:15.098
I got a little scared...

16:17.183 --> 16:19.143
...and I'd like you to come home.

16:20.228 --> 16:22.146
What is it, honey?

16:25.233 --> 16:27.777
I don't know.
I was wrapping some...

16:28.027 --> 16:30.947
...some glasses up
and some things...

16:31.906 --> 16:34.951
...and I got really scared.

16:37.912 --> 16:41.833
You're not doing this move
just for me, are you?

16:42.125 --> 16:44.794
You really want
to do it, don't you?

16:45.628 --> 16:48.840
The important thing is we're together.
That's what counts.

16:49.632 --> 16:51.426
Yeah, but you're not here.

16:51.884 --> 16:53.886
Well, I will be soon, baby.

16:58.391 --> 16:59.642
Say it.

17:01.936 --> 17:04.230
Say it!
I'll be home soon.

17:04.521 --> 17:06.398
No, say it!

17:07.025 --> 17:10.778
I'll be home soon, and I love you.

17:13.406 --> 17:15.032
I love you too.

17:16.742 --> 17:17.577
Feel better?

17:18.077 --> 17:19.871
No, I don't feel better!

17:22.957 --> 17:25.292
London Bridge is falling down

17:25.917 --> 17:27.837
Falling down, falling down

17:28.087 --> 17:30.256
London bridge is falling down
Help me.

17:31.132 --> 17:33.801
My fair lady

17:35.303 --> 17:36.763
You my fair lady?

17:40.725 --> 17:42.101
Yes.

17:45.438 --> 17:47.899
Bye.
Bye-bye.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.242
What you doing, mister?

18:39.951 --> 18:41.327
Nothing.

18:41.536 --> 18:44.247
You're trespassing on private property.

18:44.455 --> 18:46.082
Trespassing?
Loitering too.

18:46.290 --> 18:48.501
That's right.
You're loitering too.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.045
I didn't see any signs.

18:51.629 --> 18:53.423
What you call that?

18:54.757 --> 18:56.342
Graffiti?

18:57.135 --> 18:57.969
No, man.

18:58.845 --> 19:01.973
That's not fucking graffiti!
That's a sign.

19:02.265 --> 19:04.267
He can't read it, man.

19:04.475 --> 19:08.229
I'll read it for you.
It says this is private property.

19:08.938 --> 19:11.065
No fucking trespassing.

19:11.315 --> 19:13.443
This means fucking you!

19:15.069 --> 19:17.613
It says all that?
Yeah!

19:18.239 --> 19:21.242
If you wrote it in fucking English,
I'd fucking understand it!

19:21.743 --> 19:24.120
Thinks he's being funny.
I'm not laughing.

19:24.370 --> 19:27.081
I'm not either.
Hold it, fellas.

19:27.290 --> 19:30.126
We're getting off on the wrong foot.

19:33.004 --> 19:35.923
This is a gangland thing, isn't it?

19:36.132 --> 19:39.719
We're having a territorial dispute?

19:40.803 --> 19:45.141
I've wandered into your pissing ground
or whatever the damn thing is...

19:45.350 --> 19:48.561
...and you're offended by my presence.
I understand that.

19:48.770 --> 19:52.398
I mean, I wouldn't want you people
in my back yard, either.

19:52.607 --> 19:54.359
This is your home...

19:54.567 --> 19:57.236
...and your home is your home.
I respect that.

19:57.445 --> 20:01.741
So if you would just back up
a step or two...

20:02.075 --> 20:04.535
...I'll take my problems elsewhere.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.163
Fair enough?

20:07.413 --> 20:09.415
What do you think?
He should pay a toll.

20:09.624 --> 20:11.417
Good idea.

20:11.876 --> 20:13.711
You should pay a toll.

20:14.587 --> 20:16.089
Listen, fellas...

20:16.381 --> 20:19.425
...I've had a rare morning.
I'm not in the mood to--

20:19.676 --> 20:20.843
What should he pay?

20:21.094 --> 20:22.679
How about that briefcase?

20:23.513 --> 20:25.264
Good idea.

20:25.473 --> 20:28.017
Give us your briefcase, man.

20:31.062 --> 20:33.356
I'm not giving you
my goddamn briefcase.

20:33.606 --> 20:36.734
Motherfucker, give us
your motherfucking briefcase!

20:40.947 --> 20:42.115
Okay.

20:43.574 --> 20:44.742
Okay.

20:45.451 --> 20:48.121
I was willing
to mind my own business.

20:48.371 --> 20:53.001
I was willing to respect your territory
and treat you like a man.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.794
You couldn't let a man...

20:55.044 --> 21:00.008
...sit here for five minutes to rest
on your precious piece-of-shit hill?

21:02.677 --> 21:05.888
Want my briefcase?
I'll get it for you, all right?

21:06.139 --> 21:08.683
You want my briefcase?
Here's my briefcase!

21:16.566 --> 21:18.026
Where are you going?

21:18.234 --> 21:20.236
You forgot the briefcase!

21:27.785 --> 21:30.788
I'm going home!
Clear the path, you motherfucker!

21:32.498 --> 21:33.583
Clear the path!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.877
I'm going home!

21:56.272 --> 21:58.191
How'd they do that?

22:01.819 --> 22:02.904
Gun!
What?

22:03.446 --> 22:06.741
You're leaving today, right?
I gotta get your gun.

22:07.867 --> 22:08.951
Right.

22:09.452 --> 22:14.582
I need your John Doe
right here, here and here.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.426
Got time to take a statement?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.012
I know you wanna go
before you get killed...

22:28.221 --> 22:30.598
Yeah, Brian, I'm still working here.

22:30.807 --> 22:32.475
This guy's a little excited.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.061
Mr. Lee, come on in.

22:38.648 --> 22:40.233
What'd he say?

22:40.566 --> 22:43.403
You know, I don't know.
Mr. Lee is Korean.

22:43.611 --> 22:46.989
I'm Japanese, in case
you never bothered to notice.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.951
Mr. Lee, speak English, okay?
Sure.

22:50.201 --> 22:51.786
Sit down.

22:52.412 --> 22:56.874
He'll help you. Mr. Lee owns a market.
He was hit less than an hour ago.

22:57.125 --> 22:59.502
Sorry, Mr. Lee, no smoking.

23:00.837 --> 23:04.173
Mr. Lee, let's just start off
with what he looked like.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.928
White man, white shirt, tie.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.764
What color was his tie?
Color?

23:14.142 --> 23:17.186
I don't know color.
The guy attack me, okay?

23:17.395 --> 23:19.856
He bust up my store.
I'm lucky to be alive.

23:20.314 --> 23:23.568
Just try and relax.
What did he steal from you?

23:23.776 --> 23:26.029
Did not steal!
Attack me, okay?

23:26.279 --> 23:29.157
Say he fix my prices.
Bust up my merchandise.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.366
He didn't rob you?

23:30.616 --> 23:33.661
The guy crazy! I told him,
"Take my money."

23:33.911 --> 23:38.458
He say no. He call me "thief,"
then he break up my merchandise.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.543
Then he buy a soda and take off.

23:41.210 --> 23:43.338
He bought a soda. He paid for it?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.798
I told you, the guy crazy.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.134
Sorry, I thought this was a robbery.

23:48.926 --> 23:51.471
BRlAN: Mr. Lee, we have to go
talk to somebody else.

23:51.846 --> 23:54.932
BRlAN: This man works robberies.
Robberies?

23:55.266 --> 23:57.060
BRlAN:
That's right. Come on.

23:59.645 --> 24:01.856
Baseball bat!
What's that?

24:02.106 --> 24:03.649
The guy take my baseball bat.

24:04.025 --> 24:04.859
You sell bats?

24:05.151 --> 24:08.696
No, keep for defense.
Under counter. Defense.

24:08.946 --> 24:12.408
You mean he stole your baseball bat
but paid for the soda?

24:12.742 --> 24:13.993
This guy's discriminating.

24:14.285 --> 24:16.746
That still doesn't count.
Let's go. Thanks.

24:20.249 --> 24:23.044
Go to the hospital.
Your arm might be broken!

24:23.252 --> 24:25.922
We'll look for this guy,
so shut the fuck up!

24:26.130 --> 24:29.676
What did this guy do?
Threaten you with his credit card?

24:29.884 --> 24:31.511
I told you he had a bat!

24:31.719 --> 24:35.056
If this guy's still around,
we'll find him and fuck him up.

24:35.264 --> 24:36.766
Then you go to the hospital?

24:37.016 --> 24:38.267
Shut up!

24:47.110 --> 24:48.277
Hello?

24:51.114 --> 24:52.281
Hello?

24:54.242 --> 24:56.494
Cut the crap.
I know it's you.

24:57.078 --> 24:57.954
What do you want?

25:00.957 --> 25:02.959
It is you, isn 't it?

25:04.085 --> 25:05.044
Yeah.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.504
Yeah, it's me.

25:12.093 --> 25:13.594
You gotta stop calling me.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.681
It's Adele's birthday.

25:17.807 --> 25:20.184
Yes, I know.
What do you want?

25:23.688 --> 25:24.939
I'm coming home.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.233
What are you talking about?

25:28.985 --> 25:30.695
I just...

25:31.779 --> 25:35.283
I want you to know that
I'm coming home for her birthday.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.785
You're not coming here.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.748
Listen, Beth...

25:44.709 --> 25:46.502
...I gotta see you.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.717
No, you listen to me.
This is my house now. I pay the rent.

25:53.092 --> 25:54.802
You don't pay child support.

25:55.053 --> 25:59.265
You just can 't walk in and out.
Don't talk like that, Beth.

26:01.142 --> 26:03.436
I have to come home.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.855
I have to bring her a present.

26:08.816 --> 26:10.360
You know you can't come here!

26:17.367 --> 26:18.326
Hey!

26:22.705 --> 26:24.749
It's him! It's him, man!

26:27.585 --> 26:28.544
How's Adele?

26:30.546 --> 26:32.131
This isn't your home anymore.

26:37.053 --> 26:37.970
How is she?

26:40.014 --> 26:42.183
She's doing just fine without you.

26:44.686 --> 26:46.479
Angie, get out.
Come on, man.

26:46.729 --> 26:50.191
It's fucking broad daylight!
This shit ain't worth it!

26:50.441 --> 26:52.652
Get the fuck out!
Get out of the car!

26:52.902 --> 26:54.737
Give me one. Give me one.

26:55.988 --> 26:56.823
And you?

26:57.949 --> 26:58.783
Don't.

27:01.285 --> 27:02.745
I'll call the police.

27:03.454 --> 27:04.414
Go, go, go!

27:05.748 --> 27:06.833
I'm coming home.

27:10.461 --> 27:11.295
I'm coming home.

27:25.893 --> 27:27.562
Did you get him?

28:28.373 --> 28:29.207
You missed.

28:44.514 --> 28:46.307
I missed too.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.655
No, don't fucking do it!

29:03.074 --> 29:04.325
No, man.

29:04.575 --> 29:05.410
Fuck you, mother--!

29:09.622 --> 29:10.873
There, you see?

29:12.959 --> 29:14.877
That's the concept.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.722
Take some shooting lessons, asshole!

29:48.286 --> 29:49.704
She's open.

29:55.793 --> 29:57.170
Prendergast.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.297
Have a seat.

30:00.214 --> 30:01.174
Captain.

30:07.305 --> 30:08.681
Did you hear?

30:09.098 --> 30:10.767
The drive-by shooting?

30:11.225 --> 30:12.769
Disgusting!

30:13.561 --> 30:15.938
You know who'll have to take
the heat again...

30:16.189 --> 30:18.649
...when the shit hits the fan.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.033
You're retiring a little early.

30:27.659 --> 30:29.952
You won't be getting
your full pension.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.498
Yes, sir, that's right.
I won't.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.711
This isn't because
you were wounded, is it?

30:41.673 --> 30:43.091
Wounded?

30:43.383 --> 30:44.967
Because, I mean...

30:45.843 --> 30:47.762
...you're behind a desk now.

30:47.970 --> 30:50.181
Not much chance
of getting wounded there.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.935
Look, captain, it has nothing
to do with that.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.400
I'll make my speech.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.403
They make me do this,
you understand.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.864
I hate to lose a good cop.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.410
Not too late to change your mind.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.205
Lot of good cops want to drop
the whole kit and caboodle.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.915
And who wouldn't?

31:16.124 --> 31:17.375
The pay stinks...

31:17.583 --> 31:21.337
...and you're up to your ears
in human scum 16 hours a day.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.550
But it gets in your blood.

31:27.093 --> 31:29.345
A lot of good cops
get to the point of...

31:29.554 --> 31:31.806
...slapping their badge down
on this desk...

31:32.765 --> 31:36.060
...and find they just can't do it.
How about you?

31:36.477 --> 31:38.479
Will you stick with the team?

31:41.274 --> 31:44.193
No, captain.
I don't think I will.

31:49.699 --> 31:52.410
Like I say, they make me ask.
You understand.

31:53.703 --> 31:54.954
How are the kids?

31:56.247 --> 31:57.957
I don't have any.

31:58.958 --> 32:00.877
What the hell?

32:02.712 --> 32:05.006
I'd like to take my stick
to these clerks.

32:05.673 --> 32:09.802
The file says--
We lost a child.

32:10.636 --> 32:11.471
Lost it?

32:11.721 --> 32:13.306
Her. Lost her.

32:13.556 --> 32:16.100
Yes, of course. Her.
That's rough.

32:16.893 --> 32:20.188
Well, it can be.
Yes, sir.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.611
Still married, right?

32:27.862 --> 32:29.572
Yes, sir, I am.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.748
That's good.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.444
Where you going?

33:49.694 --> 33:51.362
I'm going home.
Not this way.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.949
Why not?
Metrorail construction, that's why not.

33:55.658 --> 33:57.160
Go around.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.287
Just follow your tootsies.

34:00.246 --> 34:04.375
You sure you don't want something?
Coffee, soda, something?

34:04.625 --> 34:06.544
No, thank you, ma'am.

34:07.670 --> 34:09.714
I feel kind of stupid about this.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.799
Better safe than sorry.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.634
That's what I thought.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.554
You have a restraining order
against your husband?

34:16.846 --> 34:18.097
Ex-husband.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.891
He'd show up on the wrong day...

34:21.141 --> 34:24.896
...or in the middle of the night,
pounding on the door.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.857
Thing is, he has
this horrendous temper.

34:28.149 --> 34:31.110
I didn't know if a restraining
order was a good idea...

34:31.319 --> 34:33.446
...and if it'd do more harm than good.

34:33.821 --> 34:37.408
But the judge said we should
make an example of him.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.829
So he can't come
within 100 feet of us.

34:42.455 --> 34:45.375
Or is it yards?
Which is it? Feet or yards?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.085
That's up to the judge.

34:47.293 --> 34:50.213
I thought it was a set thing.
It's at his discretion.

34:50.420 --> 34:51.797
That's interesting.

34:52.005 --> 34:53.007
Does he drink?

34:55.426 --> 34:57.804
Oh, I thought you meant the judge!

34:58.680 --> 35:00.890
No, I wouldn't say so.
Do drugs?

35:01.474 --> 35:02.558
Oh, no.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.687
But he has a propensity for violence?

35:06.187 --> 35:08.731
Yeah, I think you could say that.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.235
Did he strike the little girl?

35:13.361 --> 35:15.989
Well, no.
Did he strike you?

35:16.906 --> 35:18.449
Not exactly.

35:19.701 --> 35:21.160
Not exactly?

35:24.122 --> 35:26.833
You know, there were times...

35:27.166 --> 35:29.252
...when I thought he was going to...

35:29.502 --> 35:32.922
...but I just didn't want to wait
until he got around to it.

35:38.052 --> 35:39.971
It's hard to explain.

35:42.849 --> 35:44.726
He could, I think.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.227
You think?

36:53.878 --> 36:55.546
Hello, sir.
How are you today?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.048
I'm doing all right.

36:57.298 --> 36:59.300
How about you?
Me? I'm terrible.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.468
I'm sorry.

37:00.677 --> 37:04.597
I came from Santa Barbara,
and my friend wasn't home...

37:04.806 --> 37:05.890
...and he owes me money...

37:06.182 --> 37:08.226
...so I have no money to go home.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.270
I'm almost out of gas.
I had to sleep in my car.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.482
Do you have a few bucks?
It would really help me out.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.568
Give me your address,
I'll mail it back. Honest.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.947
Let me see your driver's license.
What for?

37:21.197 --> 37:23.157
It'll have your address on it.

37:23.366 --> 37:26.619
I don't have a license.
You drove all the way without it?

37:26.828 --> 37:28.079
Are you a cop?

37:28.329 --> 37:30.540
Let's see your car registration
and your car.

37:30.790 --> 37:34.627
All right, forget it.
Okay, just forget it!

37:36.004 --> 37:38.464
That's a hell of a way
to treat a vet, man.

37:39.549 --> 37:43.970
You're an animal doctor?
No, a veteran. I was in Nam.

37:44.470 --> 37:46.639
You must've been 10 years old.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.183
I meant to say the Gulf.

37:49.434 --> 37:52.395
Come on! All I'm asking for
is a little change.

37:52.603 --> 37:55.440
I haven't eaten in three days.

37:55.815 --> 37:58.026
Well, I mean, except for this.

37:58.484 --> 38:02.238
Fuck it! Give me some money, man.
Just give me some money.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.366
How about a dime?
Give it to me.

38:05.575 --> 38:06.951
I'm not giving you any.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.911
You got a cigarette?
No.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.498
You gotta give me something.
Why don't you get a job?

38:13.082 --> 38:15.126
This is my park. I live here!

38:15.376 --> 38:18.546
Who are you, walking
through my park with two bags?

38:18.755 --> 38:20.965
I don't got any. Is that fair?

38:21.215 --> 38:24.218
What's in those bags, anyway?
Give me one.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.805
I could sell those bags
and eat for a week with the money.

38:28.056 --> 38:30.850
You've got two of them.
Why do you need two?

38:31.559 --> 38:33.061
You're right.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.437
Here.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.440
Are you serious?
I don't need it anymore.

38:39.692 --> 38:43.821
All right! Come on, now.
Come on. What the--

38:48.159 --> 38:50.536
Son of a bitch!

38:57.335 --> 39:00.672
Can we cut the crap this time?
I'm telling you the truth!

39:00.880 --> 39:02.256
Yeah, right.

39:06.636 --> 39:09.555
What's up?
She was at the drive-by.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.308
Angie, who hit your guys?
I told you.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.062
We know. The big bad white man.
We're not buying it.

39:16.270 --> 39:18.106
Who are you protecting?

39:19.023 --> 39:22.276
They put your boyfriend in the hospital.
He's probably dead.

39:22.485 --> 39:25.238
Do you realize that?
He's probably fucking dead!

39:25.530 --> 39:28.741
Stop saying that!
You picked a good day to leave.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.036
You want another 3-year-old
to get shot in the head?

39:32.245 --> 39:33.746
Is that what you want?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.627
Tell me the truth!

39:40.420 --> 39:42.714
I'm telling you the truth!

39:43.798 --> 39:44.882
It was a white guy!

39:45.174 --> 39:48.511
Why would he go for your friends?
I don't know!

39:48.720 --> 39:52.557
He attacked them on Angel's Flight Hill
with a baseball bat!

39:52.849 --> 39:54.809
A baseball bat?
Wait!

39:56.436 --> 39:58.771
Baseball bat.
What did this guy look like?

39:59.605 --> 40:01.941
I don't know.
He looked like you...

40:02.191 --> 40:03.943
...except he was taller and had hair.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.029
Good description, Angie!

40:06.279 --> 40:08.072
Did he wear a white shirt and tie?

40:11.576 --> 40:12.827
Come over here, will you?

40:13.995 --> 40:17.290
We gotta keep the pressure on her.
Don't interrupt.

40:17.498 --> 40:18.583
What about the bat?

40:18.875 --> 40:21.878
The white shirt and tie!
What will she think of next?

40:22.086 --> 40:24.088
I'm sorry you're leaving,
but you are.

40:24.297 --> 40:28.384
Sanchez, listen to me!
Check me later, babe.

40:34.349 --> 40:35.683
Hey, Brian?

40:35.892 --> 40:38.019
Remember that storekeeper,
the Korean guy?

40:38.227 --> 40:39.729
Mr. Lee?
Come here.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.148
Where was his place?

40:42.857 --> 40:44.108
Right there.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.527
He was assaulted
sometime after 8 a.m.?

40:46.778 --> 40:50.698
About that.
And the drive-by was here, right?

40:50.990 --> 40:51.824
What's going on?

40:52.033 --> 40:56.371
I may be nuts, but Angel's Flight Hill
is between those two spots.

40:56.621 --> 41:00.041
It was a classy neighborhood.
It's a shit hole. Gangland.

41:00.249 --> 41:04.629
I know. What would a white guy
in a shirt and tie be doing in...

41:04.921 --> 41:06.172
...gangland?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.563
Hi. Can I help you?

41:22.980 --> 41:26.901
I'd like a ham and cheese Whamlette,
an order of Wham fries--

41:27.193 --> 41:30.530
Sorry, we stopped serving breakfast.
We're on the lunch menu.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.407
I want breakfast.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.492
We're not serving it.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.120
So you said.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.497
Is that the manager?

41:39.998 --> 41:40.957
Yeah.

41:41.207 --> 41:42.792
Could I speak to him, please?

41:43.960 --> 41:44.961
Sure.

41:45.336 --> 41:47.880
Rick, a customer would like
to speak to you.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.300
Yes, sir.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.177
I'd like some breakfast.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.847
We stopped serving breakfast.

41:56.055 --> 42:01.185
I know you stopped breakfast, Rick.
Sheila told me you stopped...

42:01.769 --> 42:04.605
Why am I calling you by first names?
I don't know you.

42:04.814 --> 42:09.485
I call my boss "mister" after 7 years,
but I walk in here, a stranger...

42:09.736 --> 42:13.906
...and I'm calling you Rick and Sheila
like we're in an AA meeting.

42:14.907 --> 42:18.745
I don't want to be your buddy, Rick.
I just want a little breakfast.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.664
You can call me Miss Folsom
if you want to.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.834
We stopped serving breakfast at 11:30.

42:36.262 --> 42:40.516
Have you ever heard the expression,
"The customer is always right"?

42:41.267 --> 42:42.101
Yeah.

42:43.102 --> 42:45.772
Well, here I am.

42:46.522 --> 42:48.316
The customer.

42:48.775 --> 42:50.360
That's not our policy.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.738
You have to order something
from the lunch menu.

42:55.198 --> 42:57.367
I don't want lunch.

42:57.575 --> 42:58.951
I want breakfast.

42:59.369 --> 43:01.746
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry.

43:02.038 --> 43:04.415
Yeah, well, hey,
I'm really sorry too!

43:04.707 --> 43:06.042
He's got a gun!

43:07.293 --> 43:08.211
Let's get organized!

43:09.003 --> 43:09.962
Calm down!

43:10.213 --> 43:13.091
Just calm down, everybody.
Sit down over there!

43:14.258 --> 43:15.843
Mister.

43:17.178 --> 43:18.596
Where are you going?

43:18.805 --> 43:21.808
No. You sit down there,
and you finish your lunch.

43:22.183 --> 43:25.937
Everybody just relax
and take it easy.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.816
Eat your lunch. Please.

43:30.024 --> 43:32.110
You all need your vitamins A, B and--

43:34.237 --> 43:36.489
Don't! It was an accident!

43:36.698 --> 43:40.076
It's the trigger, it's sensitive.
It's okay!

43:42.620 --> 43:44.414
It's a sensitive trigger.

43:49.419 --> 43:50.837
Could I have my breakfast?

43:51.087 --> 43:53.172
Yes, sir. Sheila?

44:01.681 --> 44:04.225
Rick? Miss Folsom?

44:04.892 --> 44:06.144
You know what?

44:06.436 --> 44:08.312
You were right.
I've changed my mind.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.815
I'm going to have some lunch.

44:11.190 --> 44:14.402
Could I have a double
Whammyburger with cheese--

44:14.736 --> 44:16.946
You getting this?
Yes, sir.

44:17.196 --> 44:20.742
And an order of Whammy fries
and, let's see...

44:20.992 --> 44:22.535
...a Choco-Wham shake.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.330
Yes, sir.
Sheila, get his order.

44:25.788 --> 44:27.749
Rick, could you
get it for me, please?

44:28.708 --> 44:33.629
I feel comfortable calling you Rick
after all we've been through together.

44:39.135 --> 44:40.678
How you doing?

44:41.387 --> 44:43.222
Enjoying your meal?

44:45.600 --> 44:46.476
How about you?

44:46.851 --> 44:48.227
Is it good?

44:52.273 --> 44:54.150
And you, ma'am? How's the food?

44:56.778 --> 44:58.404
I think we have a critic.

45:00.823 --> 45:03.660
I don't think
she likes the special sauce.

45:05.620 --> 45:07.205
That's a joke.

45:08.289 --> 45:09.707
Now, here we go.

45:10.208 --> 45:11.209
Thank you.

45:15.296 --> 45:17.423
See, this is what I'm talking about.

45:18.091 --> 45:19.008
Look at that.

45:19.676 --> 45:20.510
See what I mean?

45:20.718 --> 45:23.012
It's plump, juicy, three inches thick.

45:26.974 --> 45:30.895
Look at this sorry,
miserable, squashed thing.

45:31.646 --> 45:34.691
Can anybody tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

45:35.900 --> 45:37.652
Anybody?

45:38.695 --> 45:40.363
Anybody at all.

45:51.290 --> 45:53.042
You guys are partners again!

45:53.251 --> 45:56.546
No such luck, Lita.
He's moving to Lake Havasu.

45:56.879 --> 45:59.549
What's in Lake Havasu?
London Bridge.

45:59.799 --> 46:03.094
Are you going to England?
They moved it to Arizona.

46:03.386 --> 46:06.681
Stone by stone.
Oh, yeah. I heard about that.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.809
You're better off,
because cops get killed.

46:10.435 --> 46:11.936
What'd we used to get, six?

46:12.020 --> 46:12.603
Seven.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.564
Two sevens.

46:19.694 --> 46:20.528
You all right?

46:21.279 --> 46:22.280
Yeah.

46:24.115 --> 46:25.450
You sure?

46:27.618 --> 46:28.453
What?

46:32.999 --> 46:35.668
I'm sorry, I wasn't gonna do this.

46:35.918 --> 46:38.463
I should just shut up.
It's none of my business.

46:38.713 --> 46:40.214
Tell me.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.259
Lake Havasu?

46:44.385 --> 46:45.887
It's nice. We like it.

46:46.137 --> 46:47.388
She likes it.

46:48.014 --> 46:49.807
What'll you do, watch cactus grow?

46:50.266 --> 46:51.517
Cacti.

46:54.854 --> 46:57.023
She's not handling
middle age too well.

46:57.273 --> 47:01.027
The change of life and all that,
whatever it is that is.

47:02.403 --> 47:03.404
What about you?

47:03.655 --> 47:06.491
Me? It's different,
because she's a woman.

47:07.700 --> 47:08.868
Different? I'm a woman.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.329
But she was once very beautiful.

47:13.039 --> 47:14.207
Thanks a lot!

47:14.457 --> 47:17.168
You know what I mean.
Come on, come on.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.921
She could've been anything.
Anything but a cop's wife.

47:20.213 --> 47:21.214
She's high-strung.

47:21.464 --> 47:25.468
Don't give me that queen of the hop,
homecoming queen bullshit again.

47:26.177 --> 47:27.553
That was a long time ago.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.515
Sandra, you have a career.

47:30.973 --> 47:34.060
It's hard to lose your beauty
when that's all you've got.

47:34.268 --> 47:35.603
What about your career?

47:36.604 --> 47:38.231
I'll be okay...

47:38.481 --> 47:40.692
...you know, even without you.

47:46.948 --> 47:48.116
Sorry to break this up.

47:48.408 --> 47:50.493
Why are you here?
We got a call.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.161
Watch out! Hot plates!

47:52.453 --> 47:55.164
Don't touch my gun.
Fuck you!

47:55.373 --> 47:58.751
You'll love this one. Some
dickhead went into Whammyburger...

47:59.002 --> 48:01.462
...pulled out a gun
when he couldn't get breakfast.

48:01.754 --> 48:04.215
Then he paid for it and left.

48:04.507 --> 48:05.591
Sorry, Prendergast.

48:05.883 --> 48:06.759
He paid for it?

48:06.968 --> 48:09.137
Yeah. Move your buns.
Let's go.

48:09.345 --> 48:10.304
I gotta go.

48:10.638 --> 48:11.723
Where was this?

48:11.973 --> 48:14.726
Quintero and Fourth.
Bye, ladies.

48:15.810 --> 48:18.187
Wait a minute. Wait, wait!

48:18.604 --> 48:21.774
Let me know what this guy
was wearing, okay?

48:21.983 --> 48:26.029
You trying to crack a big one
before you disappear into the desert?

48:26.279 --> 48:29.532
Sandra, find out if he's wearing
a white shirt and tie.

48:29.782 --> 48:31.242
Let's go, lovebirds.

48:31.451 --> 48:33.244
I gotta go.
Wait.

48:34.245 --> 48:36.956
Something about my wife.
Maybe I never mentioned it.

48:38.833 --> 48:39.917
What?

48:42.628 --> 48:44.297
I love her.

48:45.340 --> 48:47.216
Let's go!

49:14.619 --> 49:16.454
STRlKER:
For seven years, I banked here.

49:16.704 --> 49:20.375
When I asked them for a loan,
a small loan...

49:20.667 --> 49:24.587
...they told me that I was not
"economically viable."

49:33.971 --> 49:36.099
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

49:36.349 --> 49:39.143
How'd your loan work out?
Did they give you a loan?

49:40.478 --> 49:42.313
He must be economically viable!

49:42.563 --> 49:45.650
There's a man with a smiling face.
A happy customer.

49:45.984 --> 49:49.570
That's what an economically
viable person looks like!

50:01.541 --> 50:03.126
How much is the..?

50:03.584 --> 50:05.420
That is only $3.

50:09.674 --> 50:12.760
I asked them for a small loan.
You know what they told me?

50:13.011 --> 50:15.555
I was not economically viable.

50:16.889 --> 50:17.807
That's enough.

50:18.933 --> 50:22.103
I'll buy this.
Yes, sir. That is $3.

50:30.445 --> 50:34.073
I'm going away now!
I'm going away, everybody!

50:34.282 --> 50:39.203
This is what happens
if you're not economically viable!

50:49.922 --> 50:51.758
Don't let this happen to you!

50:52.925 --> 50:54.302
Bye, everybody!

50:59.640 --> 51:00.558
Don't forget me.

51:20.787 --> 51:21.954
I'm sorry.

51:23.498 --> 51:24.582
We're leaving now.

51:25.124 --> 51:26.292
You are? Really?

51:26.542 --> 51:29.295
It doesn't look like
your husband's gonna show.

51:29.545 --> 51:34.384
He probably realized he could get
into trouble if he harassed you.

51:34.717 --> 51:37.804
You should call your lawyer
and tell him about it.

51:38.096 --> 51:41.599
It's one of those services.
I didn't have much money.

51:41.849 --> 51:45.770
Have them call your husband's lawyer,
make it official.

51:46.354 --> 51:50.942
In the meantime, lock up.
And if anything else happens, call us.

51:51.150 --> 51:53.611
Okay, thanks.
Sure thing.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.086
Excuse me. Hey, excuse me!

52:10.420 --> 52:14.340
If you haven't noticed,
others are waiting to use the phone.

52:14.757 --> 52:17.051
Others want the phone?
Right, asshole!

52:17.385 --> 52:20.555
Jeez, that's too bad,
because you know what?

52:26.185 --> 52:28.271
I think it's out of order.

52:38.114 --> 52:39.073
Yeah, Prendergast.

52:39.324 --> 52:40.491
Hi, it's me.

52:40.742 --> 52:43.119
He's eating and resting
comfortably now.

52:43.369 --> 52:44.537
Who is?
Mr. Peepers.

52:44.787 --> 52:46.664
Good!
I'm sorry about before.

52:47.040 --> 52:48.958
I really blew my top...

52:49.208 --> 52:52.086
That's okay, honey.
Could you hold on one second?

52:52.462 --> 52:53.296
Prendergast.

52:53.546 --> 52:54.547
White shirt and tie.

52:54.797 --> 52:55.965
Could you hold on?

52:56.257 --> 52:57.342
I gotta go.

52:57.592 --> 53:00.511
Just one second.
It's very important.

53:01.179 --> 53:03.723
Detective Torres!
Excuse me.

53:03.973 --> 53:07.310
We have about 7 million people
waiting to make a statement.

53:08.603 --> 53:10.063
Let me call you right back.

53:10.313 --> 53:12.023
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

53:12.273 --> 53:15.068
Nothing's wrong.
What do you mean?

53:15.485 --> 53:17.862
You come home then.
I can 't.

53:18.112 --> 53:21.157
It's your last day.
What are they going to do, fire you?

53:21.407 --> 53:24.952
There's a lot of red tape.
As soon as I get done, I can go home.

53:25.161 --> 53:27.330
I'll call you in a while, okay?

53:27.580 --> 53:29.624
Wait a minute. Make a list.

53:29.874 --> 53:32.251
A list?
We need boneless chicken...

53:32.502 --> 53:33.878
...skinless. Red peppers...

53:34.128 --> 53:35.672
...not green, red.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.799
Honey, hold on one second.

53:38.883 --> 53:40.718
I am tying up the phone here.

53:41.094 --> 53:43.554
Just listen for once in your life.

53:44.430 --> 53:47.475
A girl at the drive-by said
a man in a shirt and tie...

53:47.725 --> 53:50.645
...attacked her homeboys
with a baseball bat.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.939
Somebody's let that dog off the leash.

53:53.773 --> 53:55.608
I think you've got last-day-itis.

53:55.817 --> 54:00.321
This man was not swinging a bat.
He has a gym bag full of guns.

54:01.030 --> 54:02.490
A gym bag?

54:03.491 --> 54:06.244
You asked me to tell you
what he wore. I gotta run.

54:06.494 --> 54:08.204
We have to canvas the neighborhood.

54:08.454 --> 54:09.956
One more second.

54:10.248 --> 54:11.624
Please. It's important.

54:13.001 --> 54:15.378
Why don't you go to the store?
Why?

54:15.628 --> 54:17.088
It's my last day.

54:17.338 --> 54:20.258
The guys might want to have
a send off or something.

54:20.508 --> 54:22.677
What're they gonna do?
Get some broad...

54:22.927 --> 54:25.680
...with tassels dangling,
dancing on your desk?

54:25.888 --> 54:27.640
Course not.

54:28.057 --> 54:30.852
Look, while you have
been playing cop...

54:31.060 --> 54:33.604
...I'm at home
planning your retirement.

54:33.855 --> 54:36.649
It's over. The sooner
you get that, the better.

54:37.442 --> 54:40.862
You are no longer
in the law-enforcement business.

54:41.112 --> 54:44.449
Now, I will expect you
at the usual time. Capito ?

54:46.200 --> 54:48.911
Sandra, are you mad at me?

54:49.954 --> 54:52.498
I hate you, but I'm not mad.
You retiring too?

54:57.253 --> 55:00.048
Just don't leave
without saying goodbye.

55:00.340 --> 55:01.591
Goodbye.

55:02.008 --> 55:04.469
If you go up against this guy...

55:05.303 --> 55:06.137
...be careful.

56:29.345 --> 56:31.014
Hi.
Hi.

56:31.389 --> 56:32.890
I'm Nick.

56:34.183 --> 56:35.893
What can I do you for?

56:36.102 --> 56:38.271
I'm just looking for
some hiking boots.

56:38.521 --> 56:41.190
Well, well. Hiking boots, huh?

56:41.441 --> 56:43.776
Let's see what we got.

56:43.985 --> 56:45.695
These are the top of the line.

56:45.903 --> 56:48.823
Scientifically engineered
and all that crap.

56:49.032 --> 56:52.577
Guaranteed by some Sierra Club
asshole not to hurt a chipmunk...

56:52.785 --> 56:54.620
...if you step on it.

56:54.829 --> 56:57.623
Personally, I think they're
for pussies and faggots!

56:59.042 --> 57:00.585
Now these...

57:01.044 --> 57:02.795
...are Vietnam jungle boots.

57:03.421 --> 57:06.841
Cost half as much,
last twice as long and are great...

57:07.091 --> 57:09.052
...for stomping queers!

57:09.260 --> 57:13.348
When you're done, you gotta
clean out the waffle with a stick...

57:13.598 --> 57:16.059
...but you can't
have everything, right?

57:17.143 --> 57:18.561
Forget it.

57:19.687 --> 57:20.938
Come on, let's go.

57:21.230 --> 57:23.775
Have a nice day, fellas!

57:24.025 --> 57:26.361
Y'all come back now, you hear?

57:27.111 --> 57:28.529
You got a problem, buddy?

57:33.326 --> 57:34.410
You got the problem!

57:34.661 --> 57:37.121
No, you do, buddy!
Read the sign!

57:37.413 --> 57:39.290
"I reserve the right."

57:40.124 --> 57:41.376
Now take a hike.

57:41.876 --> 57:43.378
Make me.

57:44.712 --> 57:48.174
Take it easy, Mary.
Take it easy.

57:49.133 --> 57:51.844
Jesus!
Come on, make your play.

57:52.136 --> 57:55.682
Would you just come on!
I don't need this shit today.

57:56.766 --> 57:58.017
Fucking redneck!

57:59.686 --> 58:00.937
Fascist!

58:05.149 --> 58:07.443
Fucking faggots!

58:07.652 --> 58:09.487
You believe this shit?

58:10.905 --> 58:12.782
Jesus!

58:13.449 --> 58:16.327
Alternate lifestyle, my ass!

58:17.578 --> 58:21.165
Imagine what those pumpkins do
with each other when they're alone!

58:21.541 --> 58:25.378
And what about the muff divers?
Think about it.

58:28.673 --> 58:29.590
Sergeant Prendergast.

58:29.841 --> 58:31.009
She don't have to talk!

58:32.468 --> 58:35.096
What do you want?
I admitted it was a gang!

58:35.346 --> 58:37.098
She don't have to say a word!

58:37.473 --> 58:42.186
I know it was a white guy.
We gotta talk. It's important.

58:44.856 --> 58:48.067
How many guns were in the gym bag?

58:48.318 --> 58:51.904
I don't know what you're talking about.
I didn't see no gym bag!

58:52.447 --> 58:55.658
The white guy took it, right?
More people could get hurt.

58:55.908 --> 58:57.410
Now help me out.

58:59.787 --> 59:02.665
The bag was already in the car
when I got in.

59:02.915 --> 59:04.375
How many guns were in it?

59:04.584 --> 59:06.044
I don't know.

59:08.046 --> 59:09.922
Lots of guns.

59:10.340 --> 59:12.675
They got all the guns
in the fucking world.

59:37.408 --> 59:38.409
Good?

59:41.412 --> 59:42.246
Hi.

59:42.872 --> 59:43.706
Hi.

59:43.915 --> 59:44.832
Can I help you?

59:45.083 --> 59:47.335
Police officer.
I'm looking for a man.

59:47.919 --> 59:49.545
Are you now?

59:50.588 --> 59:51.589
Late 30s...

59:52.131 --> 59:53.299
...white shirt and tie...

59:54.300 --> 59:56.427
...he'd be carrying a gym bag.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.893
What's the police scanner for?

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:06.521
My own personal amusement.

01:00:08.147 --> 01:00:10.108
Seen anyone like I've described?

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:11.359
Nope.

01:00:12.110 --> 01:00:14.153
Okay, thanks.
Listen.

01:00:14.404 --> 01:00:16.239
Tell me something.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.825
Why don't they call you guys...

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:21.411
...officer-esses?

01:00:21.953 --> 01:00:23.037
I beg your pardon?

01:00:23.287 --> 01:00:27.291
You know, like actress?
Like that?

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:31.796
Something to signify...

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.382
...you know.

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:40.596
I guess they feel that a police officer
is a police officer...

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:42.598
...not a...

01:00:43.599 --> 01:00:45.018
..."you know."

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.438
Thanks for your cooperation, sir.

01:00:48.646 --> 01:00:52.066
Sorry I couldn't be of
more help, officer-ess.

01:01:01.534 --> 01:01:02.535
Why'd you do that?

01:01:03.161 --> 01:01:05.413
There's something I wanna show you.

01:01:06.331 --> 01:01:09.751
I'm not gonna turn you in.
I'm your friend.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:11.919
Come on.

01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:15.590
I don't bring just anybody back here.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.593
This is my own private stash.

01:01:19.302 --> 01:01:21.679
I got some great stuff here.

01:01:27.769 --> 01:01:29.771
World War I. Good shape.

01:01:31.147 --> 01:01:33.524
Speaking of gas, wait a minute.

01:01:33.775 --> 01:01:35.693
Wait just a minute.

01:01:45.787 --> 01:01:47.789
You know what was in this?

01:01:48.247 --> 01:01:49.916
Zyklon-B.

01:01:50.917 --> 01:01:52.168
You remember?

01:01:52.377 --> 01:01:53.544
What the Nazis had?

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:57.090
Listen.

01:02:00.176 --> 01:02:01.177
Empty.

01:02:01.803 --> 01:02:03.179
This was used, man.

01:02:04.055 --> 01:02:06.975
This was actually used.

01:02:07.642 --> 01:02:11.980
I wonder how many kikes
this little can took out.

01:02:12.855 --> 01:02:15.566
Think about it. Here.

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.658
Why are you showing me this?

01:02:24.283 --> 01:02:25.118
I'm not.

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:29.288
That's just for fun.
You can keep that.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:34.711
This is what I want to show you.

01:02:35.545 --> 01:02:37.463
The real thing.

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:41.843
Heat-seeking, shoulder-fired.
It's fucking disposable!

01:02:42.051 --> 01:02:44.721
You can take out a jet
with one of these monkeys.

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:48.474
It's for you.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:50.768
I want you to have it.

01:02:51.311 --> 01:02:52.145
Why?

01:02:52.687 --> 01:02:54.522
Because I'm with you.

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:56.190
Don't you get it?

01:02:56.482 --> 01:02:59.444
I listened to the scanner.
I heard about Whammyburger.

01:02:59.694 --> 01:03:02.405
Fucking fantastic!

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:07.035
It's a bunch of niggers, right?
On TV, it's always white kids.

01:03:07.243 --> 01:03:10.705
But when you go in there,
it's nothing but a bunch of niggers!

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:13.875
They'll spit on your food
if you're not nice.

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:16.127
I know all about it.

01:03:17.754 --> 01:03:19.172
I'm with you.

01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:21.758
We're the same, you and me.

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:23.760
We're the same. Don't you see?

01:03:23.968 --> 01:03:26.429
We are not the same.

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:29.474
I'm an American.
You're a sick asshole.

01:03:32.143 --> 01:03:33.895
What kind of vigilante are you?

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:36.939
I am not a vigilante.

01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:40.485
I'm just trying to get home
for my little girl's birthday.

01:03:40.777 --> 01:03:45.823
And if everybody will stay
out of my way, nobody will get hurt.

01:03:46.616 --> 01:03:48.034
Fuck you!

01:03:48.284 --> 01:03:51.037
Who the fuck are you?
Are you fucking with me?

01:03:51.245 --> 01:03:53.915
I am just disagreeing with you!

01:03:54.123 --> 01:03:58.419
In America, we have freedom of speech,
the right to disagree!

01:03:58.753 --> 01:04:00.672
Fuck you and your freedom!

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.548
Who the fuck are you?

01:04:02.757 --> 01:04:04.884
You fuck!
You faggot fuck!

01:04:05.093 --> 01:04:06.511
Gonna take my rocket.

01:04:06.719 --> 01:04:10.264
I ought to shoot you, motherfucker!
Now turn around!

01:04:10.515 --> 01:04:13.059
Now lean on that counter!
Go on, lean on it!

01:04:19.649 --> 01:04:21.693
Look at this shit!

01:04:25.113 --> 01:04:27.323
What is this doing in there?

01:04:27.532 --> 01:04:29.784
Faggot shit!
No!

01:04:31.995 --> 01:04:35.915
You want freedom, huh?
I'll give you fucking freedom!

01:04:36.165 --> 01:04:38.835
Further back.
Feet farther back.

01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.796
Spread them out.
Farther.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.883
You're going to jail, motherfucker!
How's that for freedom?

01:04:46.092 --> 01:04:49.178
Freedom to get fucked up the ass
by some big buck nigger.

01:04:49.429 --> 01:04:50.680
Give me your hand.

01:04:54.767 --> 01:04:59.147
He's gonna be right behind you,
just like this.

01:05:00.356 --> 01:05:03.568
Think about it.
You gonna like that, faggot?

01:05:03.818 --> 01:05:07.822
You gonna like that, you faggot fuck?
Give me your other hand.

01:05:08.197 --> 01:05:10.074
I can't.
Why not?

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:11.242
Gravity.

01:05:11.451 --> 01:05:13.828
Gravity?
What the fuck does that mean?

01:05:14.037 --> 01:05:15.621
I'll fall down.

01:05:18.207 --> 01:05:20.752
Now give me your other hand!
Give it to me now!

01:05:21.294 --> 01:05:23.254
Give it to me! Give it to me!

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:24.630
Come on. Come on.

01:05:25.048 --> 01:05:26.632
Give it to me.

01:05:46.527 --> 01:05:48.237
This isn't one of mine.

01:06:04.462 --> 01:06:06.422
Oh, my God!

01:06:06.631 --> 01:06:08.549
Oh, my God!

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:10.843
Good!

01:06:11.469 --> 01:06:12.804
Freedom of religion.

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:14.806
Now you get the swing of it!

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.725
Feels good to exercise your rights.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.864
I'm listening.

01:06:32.115 --> 01:06:34.826
We got a nutcase
with a bag full of guns.

01:06:35.034 --> 01:06:37.578
He's in Hollywood, heading west.

01:06:37.787 --> 01:06:38.955
What is he up to?

01:06:39.205 --> 01:06:41.332
He's up to a lot of trouble.

01:06:41.541 --> 01:06:45.211
Never mind, we've got
a hallway full of suspects.

01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:48.131
It wasn't a gang thing.
I can tell you that.

01:06:48.381 --> 01:06:50.466
Angelina is a tramp and a liar.

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:54.095
We don't appreciate you interfering
with our investigation.

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:58.641
I've got a positive I.D.
on the gym bag, okay?

01:07:01.185 --> 01:07:02.603
What's this?

01:07:02.812 --> 01:07:04.063
A gym bag.

01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:07.400
Does this mean you're
putting me under arrest?

01:07:09.944 --> 01:07:11.779
You guys take off.

01:07:15.283 --> 01:07:17.744
I gave you that speech earlier...

01:07:18.036 --> 01:07:21.497
...because that's regulations.
They make me do it.

01:07:21.873 --> 01:07:24.500
This one's from me.
I've never liked you.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:28.796
You know why? You don't curse.
I don't trust a man who doesn't curse.

01:07:29.047 --> 01:07:33.718
Not a "fuck" or a "shit" in all
these years. Real men curse.

01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:37.096
And I don't like a man
who's afraid to hit the street.

01:07:37.305 --> 01:07:39.849
It's bad for morale.
I'm not afraid.

01:07:40.183 --> 01:07:42.435
Get back behind that desk
where you belong...

01:07:42.727 --> 01:07:46.564
...and don't waste any more of my time
pretending you're a cop.

01:07:52.654 --> 01:07:57.116
A man in a white shirt and tie shot up
a phone booth near the Whammyburger.

01:07:58.076 --> 01:08:00.787
Did you hear me?
I heard you.

01:08:01.621 --> 01:08:03.748
Right about here, right?

01:08:04.082 --> 01:08:05.625
How did you know?

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:08.086
He got the bag of guns
at the drive-by.

01:08:08.294 --> 01:08:09.629
Then you were right.

01:08:09.837 --> 01:08:11.005
Excuse me.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:13.883
What is wrong with you?
Me?

01:08:14.092 --> 01:08:17.011
I'm a coward, the captain told me.
Get out of my way.

01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.180
Hey, look. It is your own fault.

01:08:19.639 --> 01:08:22.350
You let everybody think that,
when it was your wife.

01:08:22.934 --> 01:08:24.644
She made you get off the street.

01:08:24.894 --> 01:08:29.023
What happens between me and my wife
is nobody's business but mine!

01:08:29.649 --> 01:08:31.442
Sorry, I've been a bitch all day.

01:08:31.651 --> 01:08:34.612
She didn't make me quit.
I came home late one night...

01:08:34.862 --> 01:08:36.948
...and found her sitting in the dark.

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.866
She thought I'd been killed.

01:08:39.117 --> 01:08:42.662
She thought I was a ghost.
I had to chase her all over the house.

01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:47.875
I'm sorry.
Forget it.

01:08:48.626 --> 01:08:51.796
Where are you going?
See if I can earn my last day's pay.

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.756
Let me go with you.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.884
I thought you were on duty.

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.680
What do you say, partner?

01:09:04.058 --> 01:09:05.143
Fuck them!

01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:08.854
Go!

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.285
Hello?

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:26.080
Who were you talking to a while ago?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:30.501
You're trying to scare me.

01:09:32.295 --> 01:09:33.254
Am I succeeding?

01:09:33.462 --> 01:09:37.300
No, you're not succeeding.
So you just might as well stop it.

01:09:38.384 --> 01:09:41.261
And you're not scaring me
out of my own house.

01:09:41.470 --> 01:09:42.721
And you're not coming here.

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:47.560
But I am. I'm on my way.
You can count on that.

01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:52.357
I'm past the point of no return.

01:09:54.024 --> 01:09:55.902
Do you know when that is?

01:09:57.028 --> 01:09:59.739
That's the point in a journey...

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:02.867
...where it's longer to go back
to the beginning...

01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:05.787
...than it is to continue
to the end.

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.831
It's like...

01:10:09.415 --> 01:10:11.793
Remember when those
astronauts got in trouble?

01:10:12.043 --> 01:10:15.713
They were going to the moon
and something went wrong.

01:10:15.963 --> 01:10:17.465
They had to get back to Earth...

01:10:17.674 --> 01:10:21.010
...but they had passed
the point of no return.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:26.182
So they had to go all the way
around the moon to get back...

01:10:26.391 --> 01:10:30.603
...and they were
out of contact for hours.

01:10:32.188 --> 01:10:35.608
Everybody waited to see
if a bunch of dead guys in a can...

01:10:35.817 --> 01:10:38.027
...would pop out the other side.

01:10:41.906 --> 01:10:43.449
That's me.

01:10:44.993 --> 01:10:47.370
On the other side of the moon now...

01:10:47.829 --> 01:10:49.914
...out of contact...

01:10:50.957 --> 01:10:54.794
...and everybody's just going
to have to wait till I pop out.

01:10:57.922 --> 01:10:59.716
The police are here.

01:11:01.676 --> 01:11:03.177
Did you know, Beth...

01:11:03.678 --> 01:11:07.682
...that in certain South American
countries it's still legal...

01:11:07.932 --> 01:11:10.643
...to kill your wife
if she insults you?

01:11:13.896 --> 01:11:16.858
They're here right now.
I'm looking at one right now.

01:11:17.525 --> 01:11:18.609
Put him on the phone.

01:11:35.877 --> 01:11:39.130
What are we gonna do?
Talk to the Korean guy.

01:11:40.465 --> 01:11:43.092
Then we just start banging on doors.

01:11:55.271 --> 01:11:56.648
What is it?

01:12:00.276 --> 01:12:02.278
Where are you going?

01:12:02.487 --> 01:12:04.155
I'll be right back.

01:12:06.115 --> 01:12:09.577
I'm sure the guy will
let you use his bathroom.

01:12:23.091 --> 01:12:25.093
Prendergast, what are you doing?

01:12:36.437 --> 01:12:37.689
I know who this guy is!

01:12:37.981 --> 01:12:38.815
Who is he?

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:43.194
He had a personalized license plate.
What the hell was it?

01:12:43.403 --> 01:12:45.530
It said, "D-Fens."

01:12:46.072 --> 01:12:46.906
Defense?

01:12:47.573 --> 01:12:51.160
D-dash-F-E-N-S.
"D-Fens."

01:12:51.536 --> 01:12:55.206
They said he was on his way home.
Go check out his address.

01:12:55.873 --> 01:12:56.749
Mr. Lee!

01:12:58.251 --> 01:12:59.794
Defense!

01:13:11.347 --> 01:13:13.016
Honey, honey. No, no.

01:13:27.447 --> 01:13:29.073
Hold it! Back up.

01:13:32.869 --> 01:13:35.955
You dumb bitch! You cut me off!
What's wrong with you!

01:13:36.164 --> 01:13:37.832
Move back! Out of the way!

01:13:38.041 --> 01:13:39.500
What are you, a moron?

01:13:39.751 --> 01:13:44.672
If I wanted to be in a parking lot,
I'd buy a ticket, you dumb bitch!

01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:06.069
You can't come this way.

01:14:06.736 --> 01:14:07.904
What are you doing?

01:14:08.321 --> 01:14:10.573
Fixing the street!
What does it look like?

01:14:12.241 --> 01:14:14.118
Two days ago, it was fine.

01:14:14.369 --> 01:14:16.579
You're saying
it fell apart in two days?

01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.956
Well, I guess so.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.918
Pardon me, but that's bullshit!

01:14:22.710 --> 01:14:26.172
I don't think anything's
wrong with the street.

01:14:26.422 --> 01:14:28.549
You're trying
to justify your budgets.

01:14:28.758 --> 01:14:30.635
Are you nuts?
I know how it works.

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.098
If you don't spend your budget,
you won't get any money next year.

01:14:35.598 --> 01:14:38.393
I want you to admit
nothing's wrong with the street!

01:14:38.768 --> 01:14:40.019
Fuck you, pal!

01:14:40.603 --> 01:14:45.149
You're not gonna hold us hostage with
these yellow lights and big trucks.

01:14:47.068 --> 01:14:50.238
I'm just here to keep people
from falling in. That's all.

01:14:50.655 --> 01:14:52.657
I want to hear it from you.

01:14:53.783 --> 01:14:55.785
What's wrong with the street?

01:14:55.994 --> 01:14:59.372
I don't know. I really don't.
I think it's a sewer job.

01:15:00.623 --> 01:15:02.250
You're lying.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.836
What's wrong with the street?

01:15:07.296 --> 01:15:08.214
Nothing.

01:15:10.675 --> 01:15:12.010
I knew it.

01:15:12.218 --> 01:15:14.679
See, I knew it was fine.

01:15:16.389 --> 01:15:18.516
But I'll give you something to fix.

01:15:19.517 --> 01:15:20.852
Oh, Jesus--
Here!

01:15:22.228 --> 01:15:24.605
Hey, Charlie!
Oh, please, man!

01:15:24.897 --> 01:15:26.941
We got a goddamn nut here!

01:15:29.027 --> 01:15:31.279
Fucking guy back there with a bazooka!

01:15:31.487 --> 01:15:32.488
Pull that thing off.

01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:33.948
What thing?
That.

01:15:34.198 --> 01:15:36.743
Then pull on both ends.
It gets bigger.

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:38.995
Like this?

01:15:39.203 --> 01:15:42.081
Now flip that thing up.
It's your aimer.

01:15:42.457 --> 01:15:43.291
How do you know?

01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:45.293
I saw it on TV.

01:15:45.501 --> 01:15:47.462
What's the name of the movie?

01:15:47.712 --> 01:15:49.797
What's the movie you're making?

01:15:51.507 --> 01:15:53.468
Under Construction. You like it?

01:15:53.718 --> 01:15:55.887
It's all right.
Where's the cameras?

01:15:56.262 --> 01:15:58.973
The cameras are on.
Just stand back.

01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:02.727
What do I do now?

01:16:02.935 --> 01:16:07.190
Just look through the aimer.
What you aiming at?

01:16:09.025 --> 01:16:11.069
That yellow monster down there.

01:16:11.986 --> 01:16:14.739
Look at it and pull the trigger.
It's really easy.

01:16:15.823 --> 01:16:16.658
Trigger?

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:20.036
That one right there.

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:22.747
But aim first, man.

01:16:24.082 --> 01:16:25.458
Look out!

01:16:31.255 --> 01:16:35.009
Nothing happened.
Must have been a dud or something.

01:16:47.355 --> 01:16:48.606
Cool, man!

01:16:59.951 --> 01:17:01.411
What is it?
I'll sic the dog on you!

01:17:01.995 --> 01:17:03.830
Police officers, ma'am.

01:17:15.967 --> 01:17:17.385
How are you?

01:17:17.969 --> 01:17:19.721
Where's the dog?

01:17:23.224 --> 01:17:24.892
He's dead.

01:17:26.644 --> 01:17:30.106
What is it?
We need to ask some questions.

01:17:30.606 --> 01:17:32.692
Just a few questions, ma'am.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.819
What kind of questions?

01:17:35.028 --> 01:17:36.821
Do you have a warrant?

01:17:37.030 --> 01:17:38.531
You invited us in.

01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:41.075
Now I'm inviting you out.

01:17:41.326 --> 01:17:43.703
What relation are you
to William Foster?

01:17:43.953 --> 01:17:48.082
What are you saying?
He's my son. I don't want you here.

01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:51.586
Would you look at this?
This is really amazing.

01:17:51.794 --> 01:17:52.670
Amazing!

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.758
Does he have another house,
another place he might call home?

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:58.509
Now this is a what?

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.762
A dragon?
Don't touch that!

01:18:02.889 --> 01:18:05.141
Why would he do that?
This is his home.

01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:08.311
I want you to go now.
Did this one melt?

01:18:09.145 --> 01:18:10.313
That one.

01:18:15.151 --> 01:18:18.071
It's a giraffe, drinking.

01:18:21.407 --> 01:18:24.535
Now, of all of these,
which is your very favorite?

01:18:28.665 --> 01:18:30.833
Right now, I think this skunk.

01:18:31.084 --> 01:18:32.669
That's lovely.

01:18:33.795 --> 01:18:34.962
That's not paint.

01:18:35.546 --> 01:18:36.798
You know, his stripe.

01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.007
It isn't?

01:18:38.257 --> 01:18:40.718
It might be,
but it's not painted on.

01:18:41.594 --> 01:18:43.846
It's in the glass.

01:19:26.097 --> 01:19:27.890
What the hell?

01:19:29.851 --> 01:19:30.852
It's the groundskeeper.

01:19:31.102 --> 01:19:34.480
Well, if he is, he's
out of uniform. Hey, you there!

01:19:35.106 --> 01:19:37.025
What are you doing there?

01:19:37.608 --> 01:19:38.776
Just passing through.

01:19:39.277 --> 01:19:42.947
Nobody said you could play through.
Get off my hole.

01:19:43.197 --> 01:19:45.408
He said he was passing through.

01:19:45.616 --> 01:19:47.618
He's not a member.
Look how he's dressed.

01:19:47.827 --> 01:19:49.537
Get off my golf course!

01:19:50.455 --> 01:19:51.622
I am!

01:19:51.873 --> 01:19:53.708
Go back the way you came!

01:19:54.083 --> 01:19:56.461
I don't like his looks.
Leave him alone.

01:19:56.711 --> 01:19:59.380
What am I paying dues for?
This is my golf course!

01:19:59.589 --> 01:20:02.133
If I want to play here, I will!

01:20:02.383 --> 01:20:05.303
If he gets hit with my Titleist,
that's his problem!

01:20:05.511 --> 01:20:08.264
Don't yell at me.
I'm just here playing with you--

01:20:08.806 --> 01:20:10.183
Fore!

01:20:11.643 --> 01:20:12.602
Fore!

01:20:19.525 --> 01:20:20.360
Five!

01:20:21.069 --> 01:20:22.028
Wait a minute!

01:20:22.236 --> 01:20:26.074
What the hell you trying to do?
Kill me with a golf ball?

01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:29.494
It's not enough you got all
this land for your little game?

01:20:29.827 --> 01:20:32.372
But you had to kill me
with a golf ball?

01:20:33.081 --> 01:20:36.709
You should have children playing here.
Family picnics.

01:20:36.918 --> 01:20:38.920
You should have a petting zoo...

01:20:39.754 --> 01:20:44.467
...instead of electric carts for you
old men with nothing better to do.

01:20:50.723 --> 01:20:53.643
Frank, what's wrong? Frank!

01:20:55.061 --> 01:20:57.355
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

01:20:57.563 --> 01:21:00.650
l gotta get some help!
What's wrong with you?

01:21:00.900 --> 01:21:02.944
Help!
Your heart?

01:21:03.194 --> 01:21:06.072
Something's wrong with your heart?
What can I do?

01:21:07.699 --> 01:21:09.409
Pills! Pills!

01:21:09.701 --> 01:21:10.535
Pills?

01:21:11.369 --> 01:21:12.370
Where are they?

01:21:13.204 --> 01:21:14.747
Cart, cart.

01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:21.004
Call the paramedics!
My friend just had a heart attack!

01:21:21.254 --> 01:21:25.091
I guess you're out of luck.
Your little cart's gonna drown.

01:21:25.717 --> 01:21:29.304
Aren't you sorry you didn't let me
pass through your golf course?

01:21:31.764 --> 01:21:36.602
Now you're gonna die wearing that
stupid little hat. How does it feel?

01:21:40.315 --> 01:21:42.650
This is his room.

01:21:43.234 --> 01:21:45.403
You're a very neat and tidy lady.

01:21:45.653 --> 01:21:48.197
He cleans his own room.

01:21:48.865 --> 01:21:50.867
Now don't make me call you a liar.

01:21:51.701 --> 01:21:56.164
If he wasn't at work,
I'd be afraid to set foot in here.

01:21:56.372 --> 01:21:58.041
What's he been doing lately?

01:21:58.249 --> 01:21:59.709
Same as ever.

01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:03.671
Building important things to
protect us from the Communists.

01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:06.090
He works at Notec.

01:22:06.591 --> 01:22:08.301
The defense plant.

01:22:08.926 --> 01:22:10.470
D-Fens.

01:22:11.638 --> 01:22:13.681
Call Notec and see if you can get him.

01:22:18.186 --> 01:22:20.396
So what's going on with your son?

01:22:23.566 --> 01:22:26.444
How do you mean?
You know exactly what I mean.

01:22:31.115 --> 01:22:34.786
Sometimes he sits through
an entire meal without saying a word.

01:22:38.206 --> 01:22:41.250
He just shovels food into
his mouth like a machine.

01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:43.544
I get so nervous...

01:22:44.462 --> 01:22:46.255
...I can't swallow.

01:22:46.756 --> 01:22:50.218
I'll sit there with
the same piece of food in my mouth.

01:22:51.552 --> 01:22:54.555
I have to spit it out.
When I do, he looks at me...

01:22:54.764 --> 01:22:57.308
...like he'd like to kill me.

01:22:59.477 --> 01:23:01.145
Don't tell him I said that.

01:23:01.396 --> 01:23:03.773
I promise I won't.

01:23:04.607 --> 01:23:08.528
I try not to be a burden.
I'm not just talking financial.

01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:11.489
How could you be a burden to anyone?

01:23:13.116 --> 01:23:15.576
If William, or Bill,
as I like to call him--

01:23:15.827 --> 01:23:18.746
He likes Bill.
I call him Bill too.

01:23:18.997 --> 01:23:20.748
If Bill said he was going home...

01:23:20.957 --> 01:23:24.002
...could he have meant
where his wife and child live?

01:23:24.252 --> 01:23:26.713
Ex-wife.
We shouldn't be in here.

01:23:28.548 --> 01:23:32.385
Ex-wife, right. Elizabeth.
What's her maiden name?

01:23:32.593 --> 01:23:35.555
Trevino. She was part ltalian.
You know how they are.

01:23:35.805 --> 01:23:38.266
Where's Elizabeth now?
I wouldn't know.

01:23:39.851 --> 01:23:42.103
You don't know where
your grandchild lives?

01:23:43.479 --> 01:23:47.984
He doesn't want me to know.
He blames me for what happened.

01:23:50.903 --> 01:23:51.738
What's the word?

01:23:54.073 --> 01:23:56.617
He was fired over a month ago.
What?

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.170
Where has he been going every day?

01:24:07.754 --> 01:24:10.089
Where has he been eating his lunch?

01:24:23.519 --> 01:24:26.064
Why are you putting
barbed wire on that fence?

01:24:26.314 --> 01:24:27.315
Is it a joke?

01:24:27.607 --> 01:24:31.194
Is this how rich people have fun?
You put barbed wire on the fence...

01:24:31.444 --> 01:24:34.489
...so innocent people like me
can cut our hands?

01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:38.618
No, please. I'm the caretaker.

01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:40.453
It's just a barbecue.

01:24:41.371 --> 01:24:44.082
Dr. Ashcroft has let us do this before.

01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:47.418
You don't live here?

01:24:47.835 --> 01:24:49.879
Is it really necessary to tell them?

01:24:51.255 --> 01:24:52.423
Tell who?

01:24:53.675 --> 01:24:54.676
Altmore Security.

01:24:56.052 --> 01:24:58.054
Aren't you with them?

01:25:07.271 --> 01:25:09.107
No, please!

01:25:10.316 --> 01:25:12.402
It's okay, honey.
It's okay, baby.

01:25:25.873 --> 01:25:27.792
What kind of doctor lives here?

01:25:29.210 --> 01:25:30.712
Plastic surgeon.

01:25:34.799 --> 01:25:36.759
Plastic surgery bought all this?

01:25:38.803 --> 01:25:41.014
Guess I'm in the wrong racket.

01:25:43.308 --> 01:25:46.436
Are there correspondence courses
in plastic surgery?

01:25:51.316 --> 01:25:53.318
I lost my job.

01:25:53.526 --> 01:25:56.821
Actually, I didn't lose it.
It lost me.

01:25:57.572 --> 01:26:01.326
I'm overeducated, underskilled...

01:26:03.911 --> 01:26:06.372
Maybe it's the other way around.
I forget.

01:26:06.664 --> 01:26:08.541
And I'm obsolete.

01:26:10.460 --> 01:26:13.755
I'm not economically viable.

01:26:17.967 --> 01:26:20.428
I can't even support my own kid.

01:26:23.431 --> 01:26:25.308
Are you hurt? I'm sorry.

01:26:25.558 --> 01:26:27.769
I didn't hurt you, honey.
I'm sorry.

01:26:28.227 --> 01:26:29.145
It's all right.

01:26:30.104 --> 01:26:31.189
It's your hand.

01:26:32.273 --> 01:26:34.400
You cut your hand.

01:26:37.612 --> 01:26:39.405
It's my hand.

01:26:44.494 --> 01:26:46.496
Please take me with you.
No!

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:50.708
They won't do anything
if I'm with you.

01:26:51.918 --> 01:26:53.795
Just please let them go.

01:26:57.632 --> 01:27:01.177
What do you think?
You think I want to hurt your family?

01:27:04.931 --> 01:27:07.141
I have a family of my own.

01:27:09.268 --> 01:27:10.103
You don't believe me?

01:27:11.521 --> 01:27:12.981
We believe you.

01:27:16.985 --> 01:27:20.488
That's where I'm going.
I'm going home to see my family.

01:27:24.283 --> 01:27:26.744
It's my little girl's birthday today.

01:27:28.621 --> 01:27:32.542
We were gonna have a barbecue,
like you guys...

01:27:34.002 --> 01:27:36.546
...and she was gonna play outside...

01:27:37.630 --> 01:27:40.508
...and my wife would hold my hand...

01:27:41.843 --> 01:27:44.470
...and talk about grownup things.

01:27:48.516 --> 01:27:50.727
And then when it got dark...

01:27:51.978 --> 01:27:54.439
...we'd all go to sleep together.

01:27:57.150 --> 01:27:59.694
We'd all sleep together in the dark.

01:28:02.488 --> 01:28:04.282
And everything...

01:28:04.866 --> 01:28:07.827
...would be just like it was before.

01:28:17.337 --> 01:28:20.840
You can't leave. Believe me,
something's happened to him.

01:28:21.049 --> 01:28:24.135
It doesn't take all day
to drive from Pasadena to Venice.

01:28:24.344 --> 01:28:27.513
That doesn't constitute
a threatening phone call.

01:28:27.722 --> 01:28:30.183
The guy was talking about
Star Trek or something.

01:28:30.433 --> 01:28:33.936
He's getting a kick out of scaring you.
Please don't leave.

01:28:34.187 --> 01:28:37.857
There's only one thing you can do
to really feel safer.

01:28:38.066 --> 01:28:40.026
Next time there's a proposition...

01:28:40.234 --> 01:28:44.614
...to cut the number of patrol cars
on the street, vote no, okay?

01:28:44.822 --> 01:28:47.116
Have a nice day.

01:29:04.175 --> 01:29:05.802
What have you found so far?

01:29:06.010 --> 01:29:07.512
No luck on Foster-Trevino.

01:29:07.762 --> 01:29:10.139
Go straight to the maiden name.

01:29:10.682 --> 01:29:13.393
I've got something
on an Army-Navy store.

01:29:13.685 --> 01:29:16.229
Where?
Here.

01:29:17.522 --> 01:29:20.149
Jesus, Prendergast, I was there!

01:29:20.358 --> 01:29:21.901
That guy was a prick.

01:29:22.151 --> 01:29:23.778
You know what else he was?

01:29:24.195 --> 01:29:27.865
Murdered. They found him stuffed
in his own display case.

01:29:28.157 --> 01:29:29.617
Oh, my God!

01:29:29.867 --> 01:29:31.035
Here, I'll help you.

01:29:38.751 --> 01:29:39.585
Hello?

01:29:40.086 --> 01:29:41.671
You know what they did?

01:29:41.921 --> 01:29:46.759
They turned our ice-cream parlor into
a Southwest American, New Age thing.

01:29:47.010 --> 01:29:48.886
I went to buy a rocking horse.

01:29:49.137 --> 01:29:52.765
All I could find was a unicorn
with an lndian on top of it.

01:29:52.974 --> 01:29:56.019
Can you believe that, Elizabeth?
Can you believe it?

01:29:59.022 --> 01:30:00.106
Come on!

01:30:01.107 --> 01:30:03.276
Where are we going?
When's my birthday?

01:30:48.363 --> 01:30:51.616
Some G.I. Joe gave a geezer
a heart attack at the golf course...

01:30:51.824 --> 01:30:54.535
...and accosted a family
right next door.

01:30:54.744 --> 01:30:55.703
A G.I. Joe?

01:30:55.912 --> 01:31:00.291
He's wearing the kind of jacket
you find in an Army-Navy store.

01:31:01.417 --> 01:31:03.961
I found her!
Trevino, Elizabeth.

01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:05.004
Don't tell me.

01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:06.839
Venice.

01:31:08.508 --> 01:31:09.509
How'd you know?

01:31:09.717 --> 01:31:12.095
Where else would an Italian move to?

01:31:12.387 --> 01:31:15.306
Look what I got.

01:31:16.683 --> 01:31:21.813
We got a puppy.
We got a puppy.

01:31:23.731 --> 01:31:26.985
Happy birthday to you

01:31:27.902 --> 01:31:31.239
Happy birthday to you

01:31:46.879 --> 01:31:47.755
Hi, puppy!

01:32:00.435 --> 01:32:02.437
No answer at the ex-wife.

01:32:02.687 --> 01:32:05.565
You send the cavalry?
No, Pacific Division are pricks.

01:32:05.773 --> 01:32:09.527
They can't send units to the same
address three times in a day...

01:32:09.736 --> 01:32:11.487
...to comfort some hysterical woman.

01:32:11.696 --> 01:32:14.073
What do you want to do?
Go to Venice.

01:32:16.826 --> 01:32:17.660
Prendergast here.

01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:18.995
Who the fuck is this?

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:21.497
Shit. It's your wife.

01:32:21.748 --> 01:32:23.124
Oh, boy. Hon?

01:32:23.374 --> 01:32:26.085
Yeah, "hon." I know who that was!

01:32:26.294 --> 01:32:28.755
Mr. Peepers just scratched
the shit out of me...

01:32:29.005 --> 01:32:31.090
...and I'm bleeding like a stuck pig.

01:32:31.716 --> 01:32:33.509
Something important's come up.

01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:35.887
What am I? Dog vomit?

01:32:36.095 --> 01:32:38.139
Your wife says
she's bleeding to death...

01:32:38.348 --> 01:32:40.683
...and you say something
important has come up?

01:32:41.809 --> 01:32:44.187
When are you coming home?
I don't know.

01:32:45.271 --> 01:32:47.940
Don't tell me you don't know.

01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:51.527
I want to know when the hell
you're coming home, now!

01:32:51.778 --> 01:32:54.072
Amanda, shut up!

01:32:54.447 --> 01:32:56.074
Did you hear me?
Shut up!

01:32:57.784 --> 01:33:01.412
I'll get home when I'm finished,
not a second before. Is that clear?

01:33:01.954 --> 01:33:03.623
Is that clear?

01:33:05.875 --> 01:33:08.544
You don't have to bite my head off.

01:33:09.671 --> 01:33:13.967
And you have dinner ready
and waiting for me, okay?

01:33:14.884 --> 01:33:18.638
And leave the skin on the chicken.
All right?

01:33:21.849 --> 01:33:22.850
Goodbye.

01:33:27.939 --> 01:33:29.190
Shit!

01:33:29.941 --> 01:33:30.942
Let's go!

01:33:31.442 --> 01:33:33.528
Surprise!

01:33:36.572 --> 01:33:38.574
I'm sorry, Prendergast!

01:33:38.825 --> 01:33:43.955
We tried and tried, but could not
fit your fucking name on the cake!

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.626
Congratulations.
You made it out alive!

01:33:49.002 --> 01:33:49.836
Listen, listen.

01:33:50.044 --> 01:33:52.672
All right, hold it, hold it.

01:33:53.006 --> 01:33:56.301
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment you've been waiting for.

01:33:56.551 --> 01:34:00.888
This afternoon's entertainment,
Miss Suzie!

01:34:08.688 --> 01:34:09.772
Suzie Q!

01:34:10.064 --> 01:34:12.358
Do your thing!

01:34:12.984 --> 01:34:15.528
Is this the retiring boy?

01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:17.780
Wait, wait!
This is great, guys.

01:34:17.989 --> 01:34:22.785
This is great.
I appreciate it, but I can't stay.

01:34:23.286 --> 01:34:26.622
Jesus! What's your problem?
You afraid of women too?

01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:29.459
I don't blame him.
You ever met his wife?

01:34:31.002 --> 01:34:31.836
What did you say?

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:33.630
What?
What did you say?

01:34:33.838 --> 01:34:34.672
Nothing.

01:34:34.922 --> 01:34:37.383
We don't have time for this.

01:34:39.093 --> 01:34:40.511
You're right.

01:34:46.225 --> 01:34:47.477
Ready, honey?

01:34:52.273 --> 01:34:56.194
Happy birthday to you

01:34:57.070 --> 01:34:58.863
Happy birthday...

01:34:59.155 --> 01:35:01.157
...to you

01:35:02.533 --> 01:35:03.618
No cake for you?

01:35:03.868 --> 01:35:06.162
If she doesn't want it,
don't force her.

01:35:06.412 --> 01:35:08.247
Okay, you can have the teddy.

01:35:08.498 --> 01:35:10.249
Time to go horsy!

01:35:11.542 --> 01:35:14.087
It's okay. Horsy!
It's okay.

01:35:14.796 --> 01:35:17.423
Giddyap, giddyap.

01:35:22.387 --> 01:35:25.765
She doesn't want to.
Just put her on the horse!

01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:28.768
There we go! Horsy ride.

01:35:30.061 --> 01:35:31.145
She doesn't want to.

01:35:31.396 --> 01:35:34.899
Put her on the horse!
You can't force her like that.

01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:37.485
I bought her the goddamn horse.

01:35:37.735 --> 01:35:39.946
Here we go! Horsy ride.

01:35:40.196 --> 01:35:43.282
You're scaring her.
I want you to stop this.

01:35:47.495 --> 01:35:50.289
Come on, honey.
It's your birthday. It's the pier.

01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:53.918
It's your favorite place.
You love the pier.

01:35:57.088 --> 01:35:58.506
Why do you do this?

01:36:25.742 --> 01:36:27.201
Take the back.

01:37:00.401 --> 01:37:01.235
You okay?

01:37:01.486 --> 01:37:03.946
I'm all right.
Somebody get an ambulance.

01:37:04.405 --> 01:37:07.867
Get an ambulance! Call 911!
Get an ambulance!

01:37:08.159 --> 01:37:12.664
Tell them an officer's been shot!
Go, go, go! Get an ambulance!

01:37:15.249 --> 01:37:16.084
Be careful!

01:37:18.252 --> 01:37:19.712
Go get the bastard!

01:37:20.046 --> 01:37:21.839
He's still dressed like G.I. Joe!

01:38:16.269 --> 01:38:18.521
Daddy! Mommy, look.
Daddy!

01:38:36.539 --> 01:38:37.373
Hi, honey.

01:38:37.874 --> 01:38:40.043
I thought I'd find you here.

01:38:42.587 --> 01:38:43.755
Leave us alone!

01:38:45.298 --> 01:38:47.425
What? I can't talk to my wife?

01:38:48.176 --> 01:38:49.552
I'm not your wife anymore.

01:38:49.886 --> 01:38:54.015
No? Sugar, does this ring a bell?
"Till death do us part"?

01:38:54.515 --> 01:38:56.267
Do you remember that?

01:39:03.232 --> 01:39:04.067
I'm sorry.

01:39:04.484 --> 01:39:05.985
Sorry, sorry.

01:39:06.235 --> 01:39:07.195
What are you doing?

01:39:07.445 --> 01:39:10.114
I'm coming home from
a hard day at the office.

01:39:10.365 --> 01:39:12.742
God bless the working stiffs!

01:39:19.874 --> 01:39:22.126
Please leave her alone!

01:39:29.133 --> 01:39:30.134
Adele?

01:39:32.971 --> 01:39:34.681
You're so big!

01:39:36.516 --> 01:39:37.976
How'd you get so big?

01:39:41.229 --> 01:39:42.647
I missed it.

01:39:43.648 --> 01:39:45.733
They stole it from me, honey.

01:39:46.734 --> 01:39:49.487
Don't you worry. They're not
gonna take it anymore.

01:39:54.784 --> 01:39:56.619
Bill, listen, please.

01:39:59.038 --> 01:40:01.374
You've got to stop this.

01:40:05.211 --> 01:40:06.796
You need help.

01:40:08.423 --> 01:40:09.507
You're sick.

01:40:10.383 --> 01:40:11.384
Sick?

01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:14.178
You wanna see sick?

01:40:14.387 --> 01:40:16.681
Take a walk around this town.
That's sick.

01:40:16.889 --> 01:40:18.057
You ain't kidding.

01:40:22.020 --> 01:40:24.939
Would you believe it
that I used to fish right here?

01:40:27.608 --> 01:40:29.527
This very spot?

01:40:30.028 --> 01:40:32.864
Now they tell you,
"Don't eat the fish. It's poisonous."

01:40:34.407 --> 01:40:36.701
You can't even swim in the water.

01:40:37.035 --> 01:40:39.954
It'll give you some kind of
bacterial infection.

01:40:41.497 --> 01:40:43.291
How's that for sick?

01:40:43.875 --> 01:40:46.794
I'm having a private moment
with my family. Leave us alone.

01:40:47.253 --> 01:40:49.130
I'm leaving soon.

01:40:50.256 --> 01:40:52.967
I'm retiring to Arizona.
Lake Havasu City.

01:40:53.676 --> 01:40:54.677
You been there?

01:40:54.969 --> 01:40:56.638
That's not what I mean!

01:40:58.598 --> 01:41:02.644
They call it a lake, but it's really
just a big bowl of muddy water.

01:41:02.852 --> 01:41:05.396
But the wife thinks it's paradise.

01:41:06.189 --> 01:41:09.150
Everybody has their own idea
of what paradise is.

01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:13.655
Take me, for instance.

01:41:16.407 --> 01:41:18.534
You know what I thought paradise was?

01:41:18.743 --> 01:41:21.204
What?
If you'll excuse me.

01:41:22.789 --> 01:41:23.956
Making babies.

01:41:25.041 --> 01:41:28.127
Ain't that a kick?
Making babies.

01:41:29.545 --> 01:41:31.255
This your little girl?

01:41:32.090 --> 01:41:33.549
Beautiful.

01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:36.678
She's special.

01:41:41.516 --> 01:41:44.602
You know, my wife never was
cut out for motherhood.

01:41:45.269 --> 01:41:46.354
She did it all for me.

01:41:46.604 --> 01:41:49.399
Went through all that pain,
lost her figure, for me.

01:41:50.483 --> 01:41:53.361
Then the kid went to sleep
one night, never woke up.

01:41:54.570 --> 01:41:56.906
They called it "lnfant Death...

01:41:58.241 --> 01:41:59.826
...Syndrome."

01:42:00.952 --> 01:42:03.621
But she wasn't an infant.
She was 2 years old.

01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:05.623
She was a big girl.

01:42:07.333 --> 01:42:09.002
She was our baby.

01:42:12.088 --> 01:42:14.966
Here, darling, this is for you.
Here you go.

01:42:21.556 --> 01:42:23.391
What can you do?

01:42:24.684 --> 01:42:27.562
If she'd been hit by a drunk driver...

01:42:27.854 --> 01:42:30.481
But who do you blame
when they just don't wake up?

01:42:31.190 --> 01:42:32.150
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:42:36.612 --> 01:42:37.864
There's a guy with a gun!

01:42:42.076 --> 01:42:43.828
No! Don't!

01:42:45.663 --> 01:42:46.664
Elizabeth, no!

01:42:47.457 --> 01:42:50.084
Freeze!
You're under arrest.

01:42:50.293 --> 01:42:51.294
Get out of here!

01:42:51.544 --> 01:42:53.838
Elizabeth!
Freeze!

01:42:57.133 --> 01:42:59.510
What were you gonna do?
I don't know!

01:42:59.719 --> 01:43:01.888
Guys like you always say that!

01:43:02.138 --> 01:43:06.517
You know exactly what you were
gonna do. Kill your wife and child!

01:43:07.977 --> 01:43:12.523
Then it'd be too late to turn back.
It'd be easy to kill yourself.

01:43:13.024 --> 01:43:16.611
Let's go meet some nice policemen.
They're good guys. Let's go.

01:43:18.029 --> 01:43:19.030
I'm the bad guy?

01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:20.365
Yeah.

01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:27.413
How did that happen?

01:43:28.831 --> 01:43:31.376
I did everything they told me to.

01:43:34.587 --> 01:43:36.089
Did you know I build missiles?

01:43:37.006 --> 01:43:38.883
I help to protect America.

01:43:42.387 --> 01:43:44.263
You should be rewarded for that.

01:43:44.472 --> 01:43:48.101
Instead, they give it to
the plastic surgeon. They lied to me.

01:43:50.436 --> 01:43:54.273
Is that what this is about?
You're angry because you got lied to?

01:43:54.816 --> 01:43:57.110
Is that why my dinner's
drying out in the oven?

01:43:57.902 --> 01:44:01.030
They lie to everybody.
They lie to the fish!

01:44:02.490 --> 01:44:05.410
That doesn't give you any right
to do what you did today.

01:44:06.077 --> 01:44:10.957
The only thing that makes you special
is that little girl. Now, let's go.

01:44:12.083 --> 01:44:13.501
Let's go!

01:44:20.842 --> 01:44:22.468
Sure was hot today, wasn't it?

01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:27.265
He has a gun!
The end of the pier!

01:44:27.473 --> 01:44:30.435
Keep this crowd back!
Let's get some backup!

01:44:35.273 --> 01:44:36.691
You know, I got a gun.

01:44:43.072 --> 01:44:44.324
In my pocket.

01:44:48.995 --> 01:44:50.079
I got lots of guns.

01:44:50.371 --> 01:44:52.707
Stay there. Don't move.

01:44:53.374 --> 01:44:54.208
You wanna draw?

01:44:54.876 --> 01:44:57.587
Let's not.
Let's call it a day.

01:44:57.837 --> 01:44:59.589
Now come on.

01:44:59.797 --> 01:45:01.674
It's perfect.

01:45:02.216 --> 01:45:05.720
Showdown between the sheriff
and the bad guy?

01:45:07.805 --> 01:45:08.973
It's beautiful.

01:45:14.062 --> 01:45:15.146
On three.

01:45:15.438 --> 01:45:18.858
This doesn't have to be the end.
You have a choice.

01:45:19.067 --> 01:45:22.403
My little girl is dead.
I don't have a choice. You do!

01:45:23.029 --> 01:45:25.281
No, you have two choices:

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:26.908
I can kill you.

01:45:28.034 --> 01:45:30.036
Or you can kill me...

01:45:30.453 --> 01:45:33.164
...and my little girl
can get the insurance.

01:45:35.875 --> 01:45:36.709
One...

01:45:36.960 --> 01:45:39.003
Don't you wanna see her grow up?

01:45:39.629 --> 01:45:41.506
Behind bars?

01:45:44.759 --> 01:45:45.593
Two...

01:45:45.843 --> 01:45:47.387
Don't do this.
Please.

01:45:49.097 --> 01:45:50.348
Let's go!
Three.

01:45:59.524 --> 01:46:01.734
I would have got you.

01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:45.320
What cooperation was there
between Pacific Division and Downtown?

01:46:45.528 --> 01:46:47.655
Not to denigrate the Venice Police...

01:46:47.905 --> 01:46:51.451
...but it was one of our fellows
that put this together.

01:46:51.659 --> 01:46:53.077
Prendergast!

01:46:53.745 --> 01:46:57.415
This is Sergeant Prendergast.
Damn fine work, Prendergast.

01:46:57.707 --> 01:47:00.585
Fuck you, Captain Yardley.
Fuck you very much!

01:47:00.793 --> 01:47:02.920
I can't believe--
Did he just say that?

01:47:03.129 --> 01:47:04.547
You're welcome.

01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.845
You still here?
Afraid so.

01:47:11.054 --> 01:47:14.265
We've stabilized her.
She'll be all right.

01:47:14.474 --> 01:47:16.601
I'll see you at the hospital.

01:47:19.937 --> 01:47:21.606
How are you doing?

01:47:25.026 --> 01:47:26.277
I haven't told her yet.

01:47:27.862 --> 01:47:29.530
Oh, shit!

01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:33.409
It's her birthday.
What should I do?

01:47:34.619 --> 01:47:36.412
Tell her tomorrow.

01:47:36.913 --> 01:47:38.539
Let her have her little party.

01:47:46.214 --> 01:47:48.675
What's your name, darling?
Adele.

01:47:48.925 --> 01:47:51.636
Adele?
That's a nice name.

01:47:52.261 --> 01:47:55.348
If I had a little girl,
I'd want her to be named Adele.

01:47:55.556 --> 01:47:58.309
What's yours?
Mine?

01:48:00.186 --> 01:48:02.063
My name is mud.

01:48:04.357 --> 01:48:05.984
Your name is not mud.

01:48:06.192 --> 01:48:09.153
It will be when my wife
finds out that...

01:48:09.362 --> 01:48:11.239
...I'm still a cop.

01:48:16.452 --> 01:48:17.704
Excuse me.

01:48:21.833 --> 01:48:23.751
Sergeant just signed us out.

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.629
OFFlCER 2: All right, let's eat.
OFFlCER 1: Where you wanna go?

01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:30.258
OFFlCER 2: Let's go around the corner
and get one of those...

01:48:35.596 --> 01:48:38.516
Look what I got!

01:48:42.020 --> 01:48:44.355
Just call him, "Hi, Puppy."

01:48:44.856 --> 01:48:46.357
Hi, Puppy.

01:48:47.692 --> 01:48:49.235
Hi, Puppy.

01:48:54.407 --> 01:48:57.535
There we are!
We got everybody there.

01:48:58.369 --> 01:49:00.246
We got everybody--
