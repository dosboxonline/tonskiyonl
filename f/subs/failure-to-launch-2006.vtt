00:47.631 --> 00:49.599
I just feel really close to you.

00:50.934 --> 00:52.367
You are really close to me.

00:54.605 --> 00:58.097
Well, this way we can share everything.

01:03.347 --> 01:05.337
Wow, that's so good.

01:07.951 --> 01:09.145
Look.

01:09.786 --> 01:11.913
They're still so in love.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.420
How great is that?

01:22.332 --> 01:24.562
So, where do you see us going?

01:27.704 --> 01:30.434
Well, tonight I see us
going back to my place.

01:45.121 --> 01:46.088
Wow!

01:46.255 --> 01:48.189
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

01:48.624 --> 01:49.648
It's beautiful!

01:49.759 --> 01:51.056
Thank you.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.185
I like to come home to a nice place.

02:00.002 --> 02:02.197
I'm happy. Are you happy?

02:02.371 --> 02:06.273
Oh, yeah. Happy is what I'm all about.

02:08.311 --> 02:10.779
Tripp, as long as you're up, Son...

02:11.781 --> 02:15.512
Come on, Pop! Whoa, man.
Don't you knock?

02:15.618 --> 02:16.585
What?

02:16.686 --> 02:19.382
Your momma's...
She's snoring like a rhino.

02:19.488 --> 02:21.888
And then this music got started...

02:23.259 --> 02:25.489
Hey, you must be Melody.

02:26.195 --> 02:27.219
Melissa.

02:27.330 --> 02:29.127
Oh! It's Melissa!

02:30.966 --> 02:33.799
It's Melissa. Okay. All right.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.200
Y'all have a good time.

02:35.304 --> 02:36.794
Night, Pop.

02:40.976 --> 02:42.967
You live with your parents?

02:43.079 --> 02:44.706
Is that a problem?

02:45.081 --> 02:46.673
Are you kidding me?

02:47.216 --> 02:48.444
And she's leaving.

02:48.551 --> 02:49.813
Stomping down the steps.

02:49.919 --> 02:51.784
Unbelievable! Parents?

02:51.887 --> 02:53.047
Putting on her coat.

02:53.155 --> 02:55.089
Did you move that umbrella stand?

02:55.191 --> 02:56.920
Oh, shit!

02:57.460 --> 03:01.226
We gotta get rid of that thing.
You know we're gonna get sued?

03:01.330 --> 03:02.388
Damn it!

03:02.932 --> 03:04.399
And she's out.

03:06.301 --> 03:07.825
Another one bites the dust.

03:07.936 --> 03:09.904
And he is still here.

04:04.058 --> 04:05.525
-Morning, Mom.
-Morning.

04:05.660 --> 04:06.718
What do you say, Pop?

04:06.828 --> 04:07.920
Good morning, Son.

04:08.029 --> 04:09.724
Get any sleep last night?

04:26.514 --> 04:30.348
-Okay, honey, here you go.
-You're the best, Mom.

04:42.129 --> 04:43.494
Are you kidding me?

04:47.100 --> 04:48.795
-Have a good day.
-You, too.

04:48.902 --> 04:51.336
-Don't forget your snack.
-Thanks.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.337
-Think fast!
-Bye!

05:19.132 --> 05:20.690
So you dumped Melissa?

05:20.801 --> 05:23.531
Well, technically, she dumped me.

05:24.872 --> 05:26.305
What happened?

05:26.406 --> 05:29.341
It was last night.
We were in a restaurant.

05:29.643 --> 05:32.635
She sees this elderly couple
and they're holding hands,

05:32.746 --> 05:36.238
and then she decides to hold my hand.

05:36.750 --> 05:39.583
So she smiles at me.

05:39.786 --> 05:43.916
Next thing I know,
she gives me "the look."

05:45.259 --> 05:46.726
Dude, I'm so sorry.

05:46.827 --> 05:48.419
No harm, no foul, though.

05:48.662 --> 05:50.653
It was just time for her
to meet the parents.

05:51.532 --> 05:52.863
Not the parents.

05:52.966 --> 05:54.456
Bye-bye, Melissa.

05:54.735 --> 05:55.929
Here we go again.

05:56.036 --> 05:57.503
Yeah. What's your point?

05:57.604 --> 06:00.232
The point is, my friend,

06:00.607 --> 06:02.404
you are afraid of love.

06:02.910 --> 06:06.869
Bullshit. No, no, no, no, no, man,
I'm not afraid of love.

06:07.747 --> 06:11.046
I love love.
Look, I've had a lot of girlfriends, right?

06:11.150 --> 06:13.141
And sometimes I'm the rebound guy.

06:13.252 --> 06:14.651
Other times, when I get lucky,

06:14.754 --> 06:18.121
I'm the "explore new areas
of your sexuality" guy.

06:18.224 --> 06:20.624
But every single time, we have fun.

06:21.193 --> 06:22.455
Thank you.

06:22.562 --> 06:25.292
I have fun, they have fun.
It's good for me, it's good for them.

06:25.398 --> 06:28.231
And I would argue that's it's damn good
for civilization as a whole.

06:28.334 --> 06:29.824
If more people thought that way...

06:29.936 --> 06:31.028
I do sleep well at night.

06:31.137 --> 06:35.005
On a twin bed, with Superman sheets
that you've had since you were six.

06:35.107 --> 06:37.041
As opposed to you,
who sleeps in a king-sized bed

06:37.143 --> 06:38.201
in your mother's basement?

06:38.311 --> 06:39.835
It's orthopedic, and I need it.

06:39.946 --> 06:41.436
And at least I'm not sponging
off my parents

06:41.547 --> 06:43.447
so I can afford to get laid
on every continent.

06:44.517 --> 06:47.884
I'm a rambling man. I'm a tumbleweed.
I'm a seeker of truth.

06:47.987 --> 06:51.115
And one truth I've learned,
a child is a parent's greatest joy.

06:52.558 --> 06:54.116
Which is why I can't leave
my parents' place,

06:54.226 --> 06:55.488
because they would miss me!

06:55.595 --> 06:56.687
Amen, brother!

06:56.796 --> 06:59.196
And yet, in America,
we're shunned for our lifestyle.

06:59.298 --> 07:02.165
When we should be celebrating
our lifestyle.

07:02.568 --> 07:04.968
-We are men who still live at home.
-Yes!

07:05.071 --> 07:07.232
We're not here to apologize
about who we are, or how we do it,

07:07.340 --> 07:08.671
-or who we live with.
-No!

07:08.774 --> 07:12.039
<i>I'm looking around this table, hombres,
and I see three winners.</i>

07:12.144 --> 07:14.442
And to every one of those out there
who sees something different,

07:14.547 --> 07:15.980
I say bring it on!

07:16.082 --> 07:17.572
'Cause it's going to take
a stick of dynamite

07:17.683 --> 07:19.446
to get me out of my parents' house.

07:20.620 --> 07:22.281
The boy's 35 years old!

07:22.388 --> 07:23.480
It's just not fair.

07:23.589 --> 07:25.648
Thirty-five years!

07:25.758 --> 07:28.955
We were good parents,
and now we're supposed to be done!

07:29.061 --> 07:31.461
Hey, I don't blame my kid for staying.

07:31.564 --> 07:33.794
Our place is much nicer
than anything he can afford.

07:33.899 --> 07:35.491
Well, our son's a flight attendant.

07:35.601 --> 07:37.068
He travels so much
it doesn't make any sense

07:37.169 --> 07:38.431
-to have his own apartment.
-Yeah.

07:38.536 --> 07:41.334
Plus he has a lot of pilot friends
who let him stay over.

07:42.974 --> 07:46.307
Well, I say the whole thing comes down
to being afraid to spank.

07:46.411 --> 07:49.209
I mean you can't build a house
without a hammer!

07:49.314 --> 07:51.805
Anyone for a guava smasher?

07:52.250 --> 07:56.050
I learned to make them in Maui.
These really chase your troubles away.

07:56.154 --> 07:57.143
Cheers, sweetie.

07:57.255 --> 08:01.055
<i>And who is my hot little wahine, huh?</i>

08:02.861 --> 08:05.625
Bev? What is that?

08:06.031 --> 08:10.593
Oh, I got this in Hawaii.
This is Lono, the god of fertility.

08:12.771 --> 08:14.602
Bud has one, too.
Do you want to see it?

08:14.706 --> 08:16.367
-No!
-No!

08:16.741 --> 08:20.541
No. I mean, what's going on here?

08:21.813 --> 08:23.280
-Dougie moved out!
-Dougie moved out!

08:23.381 --> 08:24.643
-What?
-You're kidding.

08:24.749 --> 08:26.114
-Yes!
-When?

08:26.217 --> 08:27.912
What, like two months ago!

08:28.019 --> 08:29.748
It's been amazing!

08:29.854 --> 08:31.481
Hey, how many times a week
do you think we do it?

08:31.589 --> 08:32.613
-Oh!
-Oh, Bud.

08:34.926 --> 08:36.291
What? Oh!

08:36.861 --> 08:39.489
I can't believe it. How'd you do it?
Dougie's a sweet kid, but...

08:39.597 --> 08:42.498
How in the world did you get him
to move out?

08:44.569 --> 08:45.558
He met a girl.

08:45.670 --> 08:47.900
Met a girl?
Tripp meets a new girl every week.

08:48.006 --> 08:52.136
Well, let's just say maybe he hasn't met
the right girl.

08:56.715 --> 09:00.207
Al, I don't want another recliner.
I want something new.

09:00.318 --> 09:02.786
Hey, here's something new!

09:03.321 --> 09:04.686
Cup holders.

09:04.789 --> 09:07.189
That's not what I'm talking about.

09:07.425 --> 09:08.756
-Okay.
-That's nice.

09:08.860 --> 09:10.053
Get what you want.

09:10.160 --> 09:13.323
Just know that I'm going to be having
an affair within the next six months.

09:13.430 --> 09:16.422
If I've gotta recline,
I'm making it interesting.

09:16.533 --> 09:17.500
Deal.

09:17.601 --> 09:18.693
Hey, gang.

09:18.802 --> 09:21.532
Let's stay on point here, huh?
We're picking out chairs.

09:22.139 --> 09:24.630
Hello, Dolly!

09:24.742 --> 09:26.334
Son, you see her?

09:28.378 --> 09:29.777
Pop? Pick a chair.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.006
This is the one I want.

09:31.115 --> 09:32.810
-Sold.
-No, that's polka dot.

09:32.916 --> 09:34.281
We're not gonna put that in the house.

09:34.384 --> 09:35.373
Pop, relax.

09:35.519 --> 09:37.453
She's taking the chair with her
when she leaves you.

09:39.323 --> 09:40.585
We ain't buying that chair.

09:40.691 --> 09:42.921
I am getting this polka-dot chair.
I've got my own money.

09:43.026 --> 09:45.620
Unless you start dancing again,
you're broke.

09:48.332 --> 09:49.731
Excuse me.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.232
-That's mine.
-Yes, ma'am.

09:52.035 --> 09:53.559
You're buying that?

09:53.670 --> 09:54.659
No.

09:58.375 --> 10:00.468
Want a cocktail, blanket or anything?

10:00.577 --> 10:02.602
No, I just need my 20 minutes.

10:02.713 --> 10:04.647
-For what?
-To clear my head.

10:06.717 --> 10:08.582
I come here to relax.

10:09.219 --> 10:12.746
You know what helps me?
Put on the Food Network.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.853
Takes the edge right off.

10:14.958 --> 10:16.789
Gotta find what works for you.

10:19.696 --> 10:21.994
Okay, look, the salesmen don't mind
because I bring them coffee,

10:22.099 --> 10:23.964
and the music selection
is a soothing blend

10:24.067 --> 10:26.433
of mid-'70s singer-songwriters
and smooth jazz.

10:26.537 --> 10:28.471
It's practically narcotic.

10:28.572 --> 10:30.540
And, usually, people leave me alone.

10:30.641 --> 10:32.074
Sure they do.

10:34.478 --> 10:35.809
There's what you're talking about.

10:35.913 --> 10:37.073
It's nice, huh?

10:37.181 --> 10:40.514
Yeah! I make fun of my parents,
but these babies are sweet.

10:40.884 --> 10:42.612
-I'm Paula.
-I'm Tripp.

10:42.718 --> 10:45.243
You know, usually I don't sleep
with someone on the first date.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.481
I don't think this counts as a first date.

10:48.691 --> 10:51.660
It would be a date if you asked me
to have a drink tonight.

10:52.895 --> 10:54.328
Wanna have a drink tonight?

10:54.497 --> 10:56.692
Can't. How about lunch tomorrow?

10:56.799 --> 10:59.427
Sure. Wait. Tomorrow's Saturday.

11:00.603 --> 11:02.195
Sometimes I eat on Saturdays.

11:02.305 --> 11:04.398
No, I'm doing something
with my nephew.

11:05.007 --> 11:06.599
How about Monday?

11:08.744 --> 11:10.109
I'll meet you here.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.010
Beautiful.

11:23.860 --> 11:24.952
Hey, hey!

11:25.061 --> 11:27.393
Hey, Paula.

11:27.530 --> 11:30.363
Good news, it's Champagne Thursday.

11:30.700 --> 11:31.792
It's Friday.

11:31.901 --> 11:34.335
Yeah, Thursday came twice this week.

11:35.271 --> 11:37.102
For the third straight week.

11:37.206 --> 11:39.197
There's talk of making it permanent.

11:39.308 --> 11:40.969
Kind of like daylight-savings time?

11:41.077 --> 11:43.136
Right. But for booze.

11:44.013 --> 11:45.878
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

11:47.250 --> 11:48.945
Shut up, you whore.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.516
I'm sorry.
Was I sipping too loudly for you?

11:52.622 --> 11:53.782
No, you're not sipping too loud.

11:53.890 --> 11:56.518
It's that goddamn bird
outside my goddamn window.

11:56.626 --> 11:59.823
What the hell kind of devil bird
chirps at night?

12:02.899 --> 12:04.764
I think it sounds kind of pretty.

12:06.669 --> 12:08.102
You met a guy today.

12:08.204 --> 12:09.694
As a matter of fact, I did.

12:09.805 --> 12:11.102
He's cute, too.

12:11.207 --> 12:12.935
I met a guy today, too.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.201
Really?

12:15.076 --> 12:16.703
He's a radiologist.

12:16.811 --> 12:18.472
Well, that's a step up.

12:18.580 --> 12:21.549
He offered to give me a full-body scan
next week, free of charge.

12:21.650 --> 12:22.810
Those don't come cheap, you know.

12:22.918 --> 12:25.409
I know. I'm pretty excited about it.

12:29.157 --> 12:30.385
How cute?

12:32.494 --> 12:33.552
Cute.

12:34.062 --> 12:36.326
Well, Tripp's a really nice guy.

12:36.431 --> 12:39.525
He's smart, he's sweet, he's funny.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.762
We had a wonderful first meeting.
I see incredible potential here.

12:42.871 --> 12:44.395
So all systems are go?

12:44.506 --> 12:46.531
Based on the initial
personality assessment,

12:46.641 --> 12:49.109
I think that I can have your son
moved out of this house

12:49.210 --> 12:52.008
and living on his own by June 15th.

12:52.948 --> 12:54.279
Hallelujah!

12:54.883 --> 12:57.010
Well, you know, you'd be amazed
at how many adult children

12:57.118 --> 12:58.278
are still living at home.

12:58.386 --> 13:02.083
Now, it's my opinion that the root cause
is a lack of self-esteem.

13:02.190 --> 13:04.351
Oh, Oprah talks about that all the time.

13:04.459 --> 13:05.756
Oprah don't know crap!

13:05.860 --> 13:08.124
Heck, when I was growing up,
nobody had self-esteem,

13:08.229 --> 13:09.321
and we turned out fine.

13:09.431 --> 13:11.865
You're a rock, Al.
You make me a better woman.

13:11.967 --> 13:15.926
Look, many young men who should
be able to move out, simply can't.

13:16.037 --> 13:19.165
It's called "failure to launch."
And that's where I come in.

13:19.274 --> 13:22.402
Young men develop self-esteem best
during a romantic relationship,

13:22.510 --> 13:24.273
so I simulate one.

13:24.379 --> 13:26.472
We have a memorable meeting.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.206
We get to know each other
over a few casual meals,

13:29.317 --> 13:31.046
he helps me through
an emotional crisis,

13:31.152 --> 13:32.483
then I meet his friends,

13:33.054 --> 13:34.681
if he has any,

13:34.789 --> 13:36.484
then I let him teach me something...

13:36.591 --> 13:38.081
But the bottom line is,

13:38.326 --> 13:39.293
he bonds with me.

13:39.494 --> 13:41.121
He lets go of you.

13:41.262 --> 13:42.695
He moves out.

13:43.598 --> 13:47.192
But how do you make sure
that he'll fall in love with you?

13:47.301 --> 13:49.394
You look nice,
you find out what they like,

13:49.503 --> 13:51.403
and then you pretend to like it, too.

13:51.505 --> 13:53.530
That is pretty much how it works.

13:55.109 --> 13:56.235
What about sex?

13:56.343 --> 13:58.470
Al, I never have sex with a client.

13:58.579 --> 14:01.673
Besides, I need to keep Tripp motivated,

14:01.982 --> 14:05.008
and let's face it, after men have sex...

14:06.487 --> 14:08.284
Is there anything that we need to do?

14:08.389 --> 14:11.415
Well, for starters, you could make life
a little more difficult for him.

14:11.525 --> 14:15.518
You know, more chores,
more responsibilities, that kind of thing.

14:15.629 --> 14:18.860
I just think you should know that Tripp
has had some rough breaks.

14:18.966 --> 14:21.025
I promise you, when this is over,

14:21.135 --> 14:23.968
Tripp is going to be an independent,

14:24.071 --> 14:26.232
self-sufficient adult.

14:27.341 --> 14:28.638
Shut up, dude! Don't help him!

14:28.742 --> 14:30.471
-Watch the safety. No, no, no.
-No, he's in a run defense...

14:30.577 --> 14:31.874
Don't do it! Don't do it! I got you!
I got you!

14:31.979 --> 14:34.004
-Throw it to Moss. Throw it to Moss!
-Watch out! I'm going deep!

14:34.114 --> 14:35.604
No, you don't! Shit!

14:35.716 --> 14:36.740
That's a bad word, Jeffrey.

14:36.850 --> 14:39.512
So is "bastard," but that just means
your parents aren't married.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.917
-Look at him! Look at him!
-No! Shit!

14:41.021 --> 14:42.318
He could go all the way!

14:42.423 --> 14:43.754
Touchdown!

14:43.857 --> 14:45.324
Yes!

14:45.893 --> 14:47.292
-Sit down!
-That's a face!

14:48.295 --> 14:49.353
That's great, man.

14:49.463 --> 14:50.930
That's good sportsmanship.
Nice dance.

14:51.031 --> 14:54.262
Wow, my forehead itches.

14:54.902 --> 14:58.235
That's cool, the "L" for loser.
Keep it up, little man.

14:58.338 --> 14:59.600
I'll make you walk home.

14:59.706 --> 15:00.866
Hell, you are such a good uncle.

15:00.974 --> 15:02.908
That's like eight miles.
It'll take you two days.

15:03.010 --> 15:04.170
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.745
-Hi.
-Tripp, we're going out.

15:05.846 --> 15:08.337
All right, listen, you got any more
chips and salsa downstairs?

15:08.449 --> 15:10.280
Oh, I didn't get to the store.

15:11.318 --> 15:12.285
But you could go.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.381
And you said you needed
your basketball shorts,

15:16.489 --> 15:17.888
so I put them in the laundry.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.117
-Right. Thank you, babe.
-But I didn't get to it.

15:20.226 --> 15:22.319
So you're going to need to do a load.

15:22.428 --> 15:23.520
A load?

15:23.629 --> 15:27.531
And your bathroom needs cleaning,
so I left the stuff in the hall.

15:27.633 --> 15:29.100
And when you're done
with the rubber gloves,

15:29.202 --> 15:31.432
just remember to turn them inside out.

15:31.838 --> 15:32.805
Bye.

15:38.444 --> 15:40.275
Something's wrong with your mom.

15:41.380 --> 15:43.007
This is really nice.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.084
I've never actually been
on a sailboat before.

15:45.184 --> 15:46.811
Hey, I'd be fine

15:46.986 --> 15:48.954
if I never set foot on solid ground again.

15:49.055 --> 15:51.683
You know, I bet I'd really love it
if we ever left the dock.

15:51.791 --> 15:52.917
Well, yeah!

15:53.025 --> 15:54.856
But to actually take you out on the water
on a first date

15:54.961 --> 15:56.553
would be very forward of me, Paula.

15:56.662 --> 15:59.130
Well, so far I must say
I'm very impressed.

15:59.232 --> 16:01.928
Beautiful setting, a simple meal...

16:02.268 --> 16:04.259
I assume this technique
has worked in the past?

16:04.470 --> 16:06.131
Yes, ma'am, it has.

16:06.472 --> 16:07.564
Is it working now?

16:07.673 --> 16:09.732
You know what? It kind of is.

16:13.045 --> 16:14.512
Let's go for a walk.

16:14.614 --> 16:16.707
But I'm not done with lunch.

16:17.884 --> 16:19.351
Yeah, you are.

16:21.654 --> 16:24.418
Seriously, I'm not one of those girls
who don't eat. I want...

16:24.524 --> 16:25.923
I wanted all of that.

16:26.025 --> 16:28.255
See, technically, this is not my boat.

16:28.361 --> 16:31.057
Actually, it's not my boat in any way.

16:31.564 --> 16:33.998
-What?
-I'm a boat broker. I sell boats.

16:34.100 --> 16:37.729
I would love to own a boat like this,
but it's not the right time in my life.

16:37.837 --> 16:40.237
Besides, the guy
who does own this boat

16:40.339 --> 16:42.068
is right behind you.

16:42.542 --> 16:45.705
Hey there, Mr. Axelrod!
I thought you were out of town!

16:45.811 --> 16:47.903
Well, I was, and now I'm not.

16:48.580 --> 16:51.413
What's going on? Is that a fork?
Are you eating on my boat?

16:51.516 --> 16:52.483
No.

16:54.052 --> 16:55.679
When did you redo the galley?

16:58.089 --> 16:59.283
Oh, you're in the market?

16:59.391 --> 17:01.359
Might be. What's she draw?

17:01.459 --> 17:02.858
Seven-three.

17:03.428 --> 17:04.792
Cherry's a little dark.

17:05.297 --> 17:06.662
The wife picked it.

17:06.830 --> 17:08.195
It's got nice lines.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.858
She's fast, too.

17:10.902 --> 17:12.597
Well, she certainly is yare.

17:14.239 --> 17:16.263
I'll think about it. Thanks for your time.

17:16.374 --> 17:17.840
Yes, ma'am.

17:18.175 --> 17:19.143
Thank you.

17:22.247 --> 17:24.078
You're gonna let her walk away?

17:24.182 --> 17:26.582
I'm giving her space, Mr. Axelrod.

17:27.719 --> 17:28.913
Now,

17:30.188 --> 17:32.122
I'm going after her.

17:35.694 --> 17:39.721
Excuse me, ma'am.
"She certainly is yare"?

17:39.831 --> 17:41.162
<i>Philadelphia Story.</i>

17:41.266 --> 17:42.392
Sweet.

17:42.901 --> 17:46.803
All right, assuming
that pretending to own a yacht

17:46.905 --> 17:50.341
was a brilliant, romantic,
yet ultimately flawed idea,

17:50.442 --> 17:52.672
how do you see the rest of the date
playing out?

17:52.777 --> 17:57.009
I don't know. I'm so hungry I can't think.
Seagulls ate my lunch.

17:57.482 --> 17:58.847
What if I take you to a restaurant?

17:58.950 --> 18:00.508
Are you gonna pretend to own it?

18:00.619 --> 18:03.816
No. All the restaurants I own
are in Europe.

18:11.696 --> 18:13.891
Well, hey there, Ace.
Glad you could make it, man.

18:13.999 --> 18:15.091
We thought you went home.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.691
I fell into a deep, dark crevasse.
I was so scared.

18:19.503 --> 18:20.765
Did you go out with La-Z-Girl?

18:20.871 --> 18:22.998
Paula. I did. We had lunch.

18:23.107 --> 18:24.597
Will there be a second date?

18:24.708 --> 18:26.335
There will be a second date.

18:26.443 --> 18:28.411
Yet the relationship
is doomed to failure.

18:28.512 --> 18:30.912
Right. And why are we doomed?

18:32.249 --> 18:33.739
You live with your parents?

18:33.851 --> 18:34.840
He's right.

18:34.952 --> 18:38.410
Your entire life is set up perfectly
for ending relationships.

18:38.522 --> 18:39.648
We've been out one time.

18:39.757 --> 18:42.191
She's a nice girl, I'm a nice guy,
we had fun.

18:42.293 --> 18:44.386
And I must tell you, son,

18:45.663 --> 18:47.858
nothing is doomed.

19:14.391 --> 19:15.983
Gnarly crash!

19:16.327 --> 19:17.658
What are you doing?

19:18.729 --> 19:21.129
Remember, we're the visitors here.

19:26.003 --> 19:27.197
Come on.

19:27.371 --> 19:30.033
-Wow. You're feeding it a little peanut?
-Yeah.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.233
He gets that stuff all the time, man.

19:32.776 --> 19:33.970
This is what he wants.

19:34.078 --> 19:35.875
You want a treat from the big city, boy?

19:35.979 --> 19:37.913
He's not a child, Tripp.

19:39.149 --> 19:40.377
Look how peaceful he is.

19:40.484 --> 19:41.644
Come here, little boy.

19:41.752 --> 19:43.947
You want a little bit of chocolate,
baby-boo-boo?

19:44.054 --> 19:45.282
You're giving him a PowerBar?

19:45.389 --> 19:47.016
Everybody loves chocolate.

19:47.925 --> 19:49.323
Tripp, he's saying no.

19:49.425 --> 19:50.756
Look into my eyes.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.350
He's saying no, Tripp.

19:55.898 --> 19:58.594
Tripp? Tripp? Dude?

20:01.804 --> 20:03.032
Get off!

20:08.111 --> 20:09.942
What is he doing? Is that a squirrel?

20:10.046 --> 20:11.445
No, it's a chipmunk.

20:15.184 --> 20:16.549
Watch the bike.

20:25.728 --> 20:28.060
Oh, hey. I'm Tripp.

20:28.998 --> 20:30.556
You must be Kit.

20:34.070 --> 20:35.469
It's a mockingbird.

20:35.571 --> 20:36.663
Who did what?

20:36.773 --> 20:38.172
It's a mockingbird.

20:38.274 --> 20:39.536
What is?

20:39.642 --> 20:42.406
You don't hear that?
That annoying noise.

20:42.678 --> 20:44.475
Oh, yeah, now I hear it.

20:44.580 --> 20:45.638
I looked it up.

20:45.748 --> 20:48.808
They can imitate car alarms,
and telephones, and other birds.

20:48.918 --> 20:50.783
I called Animal Control,
and you know what they said?

20:50.887 --> 20:54.653
They said I should just enjoy
one of nature's most talented singers.

20:54.757 --> 20:56.725
-Yeah.
-I'm gonna kill it.

20:58.428 --> 20:59.895
Okay, I'm all set.

21:00.229 --> 21:01.560
-Oh, wow.
-Hi.

21:01.664 --> 21:02.926
Wow, look at you.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.397
Well, look at you.

21:04.567 --> 21:05.932
Sweet shoes.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.763
Really? Thanks.

21:08.604 --> 21:11.072
Okay, well, Kit, we're gonna go.
See you.

21:11.174 --> 21:12.607
-You ready?
-Yeah.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.369
Okay, you two kids have a blast.

21:14.477 --> 21:17.378
-Thanks.
-Hey, Kit, good luck with the...

21:24.753 --> 21:26.414
It's a chipmunk bite.

21:26.521 --> 21:29.183
I figured.
Obviously not a normal chipmunk.

21:29.291 --> 21:30.315
You're right about that.

21:30.425 --> 21:35.021
No, this was like a big, oversized, like,
bobcat, grizzly-bear chipmunk.

21:35.197 --> 21:37.165
I'm pretty fortunate to still be here.

21:37.265 --> 21:38.425
-Wow.
-Yeah.

21:38.533 --> 21:39.500
What did the doctor say?

21:39.601 --> 21:40.693
I didn't need to see a doctor.

21:40.802 --> 21:43.498
I had some cream at home
that I put on it.

21:43.638 --> 21:45.697
-You had chipmunk cream?
-Yeah.

21:45.807 --> 21:47.399
-Wow, that's lucky.
-Isn't it?

21:49.578 --> 21:51.102
I take it you like Japanese food.

21:51.213 --> 21:52.510
Oh, I love it.

21:52.614 --> 21:55.048
I'm also gonna order a huge dessert,
drink too much,

21:55.150 --> 21:56.981
and maybe talk about my old boyfriends.

21:57.085 --> 21:58.643
-Yeah?
-Does that intimidate you?

21:58.753 --> 22:00.084
Not at all.

22:00.989 --> 22:02.081
Cheers, Paula.

22:02.190 --> 22:03.384
Cheers.

22:06.294 --> 22:10.458
All right, T-R-l-double-P going in
to get a little squid.

22:12.467 --> 22:13.991
Do you need me to help you with that?

22:14.102 --> 22:16.696
I got it. I got it. Look at this, look at this.

22:16.905 --> 22:18.167
I admire the confidence.

22:18.273 --> 22:20.241
Thank you. I am fairly...

22:21.309 --> 22:23.436
ambidextrous.

22:25.413 --> 22:26.573
Oh, shit.

22:26.681 --> 22:29.081
I'm sorry! Excuse me.

22:29.184 --> 22:30.742
Squid's a little bit greasy tonight.

22:30.852 --> 22:32.615
Sorry. Yeah.

22:32.721 --> 22:33.983
That's not easy to do.

22:34.089 --> 22:35.351
I didn't see anything.

22:37.025 --> 22:39.926
Tell me about yourself.
What do you do for a living?

22:41.530 --> 22:43.794
I teach special needs kids.

22:47.802 --> 22:48.791
-How's the hand?
-It's fine.

22:48.904 --> 22:49.928
-Is it throbbing?
-No.

22:50.038 --> 22:52.267
Is the medication wearing off?

22:53.007 --> 22:54.474
Gotta scratch.

22:56.477 --> 22:57.603
Oh, yeah.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.678
Well,

23:00.381 --> 23:01.712
home again.

23:02.116 --> 23:03.208
Home again.

23:03.417 --> 23:04.441
I had a nice time.

23:04.552 --> 23:05.576
I did, too.

23:05.686 --> 23:06.880
Good.

23:07.054 --> 23:08.214
I had fun.

23:08.322 --> 23:09.380
Good.

23:11.191 --> 23:15.025
Shut up!
Shut up you crazy bastard bird bitch!

23:15.930 --> 23:17.261
Hey, Kit!

23:17.665 --> 23:18.893
What? Hi.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.357
Can you guys see me?

23:21.468 --> 23:22.435
-Yeah!
-Yeah.

23:22.536 --> 23:24.231
Oh. Great.

23:26.507 --> 23:27.565
What?

23:28.075 --> 23:29.702
Dinner and a show.

23:33.914 --> 23:35.245
Good night.

23:36.884 --> 23:37.952
Good night.

23:38.152 --> 23:40.143
Now, what type of a boat
do you see yourself in?

23:40.254 --> 23:41.482
Well, I'm not sure.

23:41.589 --> 23:43.750
But I do know that I need
to be out in the open sea.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.825
Well, you gotta ask yourself
some questions.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.553
Do you like speed?

23:47.761 --> 23:49.854
Do you like to hear
the roar of an engine?

23:49.964 --> 23:52.865
Do you want to get from point A
to point B as quickly as possible?

23:52.967 --> 23:54.832
If that turns you on,
then you want a powerboat.

23:54.935 --> 23:57.802
Okay, that's it. That's it.
Power. That's me. Yes.

23:57.905 --> 24:00.237
Well, that's one way to go.
But maybe you want to slow down.

24:00.341 --> 24:02.241
You know, listen to the wind
and the water.

24:02.343 --> 24:04.777
Have sunrise and sunset
as your only clock.

24:04.878 --> 24:06.607
Know that you could go
around the world

24:06.714 --> 24:08.841
on less than a tank of gas.

24:09.783 --> 24:13.742
Now, if that sounds good to you,
then maybe you're sailors.

24:13.854 --> 24:16.379
This is not a hobby. This...

24:16.857 --> 24:17.846
It's a lifestyle.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.620
Well, now that is passion!

24:20.728 --> 24:22.389
-What has happened to you?
-What's happened to me?

24:22.496 --> 24:24.156
I want to feel the wind.

24:24.263 --> 24:25.321
I do not want to feel...

24:25.431 --> 24:27.365
I want to make the wind, okay? Look...

24:27.467 --> 24:28.695
-Make the wind?
-Yeah. I'm not a sailor.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.359
You don't make wind
sitting on a boat in a dock.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.870
I'm a power guy. Power.
Like "power boat."

24:32.972 --> 24:33.961
-You're a power guy?
-Excuse me.

24:34.207 --> 24:36.437
-I want to feel that beneath...
-Guys who drink Kahlua and cream

24:36.542 --> 24:38.407
are not power guys, honey.

24:38.511 --> 24:39.637
Tripp.

24:42.382 --> 24:44.373
Whoa, slow down, slow down, Paula.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.884
Mr. Fritz was my best friend

24:48.688 --> 24:50.679
since he was a little puppy.

24:51.391 --> 24:53.859
Just a little fur ball.

24:53.993 --> 24:57.485
He was too small
to even jump up on the bed

24:57.730 --> 24:59.220
and now he's...

25:01.100 --> 25:02.067
He's...

25:02.902 --> 25:04.597
Got a tissue or something?

25:07.440 --> 25:09.374
-He saved my life, you know.
-He did?

25:09.475 --> 25:13.536
And now I can't do
anything for him, and I...

25:29.862 --> 25:31.489
Oh, shit.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.758
I'm so glad you're here.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.869
Yeah, of course I am.

25:46.446 --> 25:48.573
Can I have a minute alone with him?

25:50.149 --> 25:51.241
Thank you.

25:51.350 --> 25:53.375
-I'll be right outside.
-Okay.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.488
Thanks, Gretchen.

26:03.595 --> 26:04.789
Anytime.

26:05.297 --> 26:07.788
Gosh, Emotional Crisis Day
is so critical.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.060
I cry, he cries.

26:10.168 --> 26:11.692
It totally bonds us.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.395
So how long do you think
he's gonna sleep for?

26:13.505 --> 26:15.473
Half an hour.
He's only here for some dental work.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.008
Oh. What's his real name, anyway?

26:18.110 --> 26:19.134
I don't know.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.405
I just clean their teeth
and chop their balls off.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.486
God, that is so sad.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.180
Yeah, it was a beautiful dog, man.

26:31.289 --> 26:32.688
She was devastated.

26:32.791 --> 26:35.191
Well, this is exactly what she needs.
Good choice.

26:35.293 --> 26:37.853
-There she is. Hey, Paula.
-Hi.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.523
Paula, these are my good friends,
Demo and Ace. Guys, Paula.

26:40.632 --> 26:41.758
Hi, it's nice to meet you.

26:41.867 --> 26:44.529
-I'm so sorry for your loss.
-Come on, don't.

26:44.636 --> 26:45.864
Thank you.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.269
-Nice suit. How you doing?
-Thank you. Hi.

26:48.540 --> 26:52.806
You know, most guys would've
sent flowers, chocolates maybe,

26:52.911 --> 26:56.244
but I gotta say,
I did not see this coming.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.078
Well, you know,
anybody can send flowers, Paula.

26:59.184 --> 27:02.085
Now, I'm going to let you in
on "the" secret.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.314
It's called the "finger roll."
Quick fingers, light on the trigger.

27:05.423 --> 27:07.152
See, double trigger...

27:07.626 --> 27:10.652
More paintballs in less time
means victory.

27:10.762 --> 27:12.024
Let's see it.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.290
When you're out there today

27:13.398 --> 27:16.367
and you got these paintballs
flying at you at over 200 miles an hour,

27:16.468 --> 27:20.199
I guarantee you will not be thinking
about the late, great Mr. Fritz.

27:21.072 --> 27:23.939
Holy moly. They really move that fast?

27:25.543 --> 27:26.908
Oh, my God!

27:28.679 --> 27:29.771
I'm so sorry!

27:29.880 --> 27:31.006
Nice shot!

27:31.115 --> 27:32.673
-Oh, thanks.
-He's okay.

27:37.154 --> 27:38.917
Let's go shoot some strangers, huh?

27:45.996 --> 27:48.658
First one to paint the skirt gets a beer.

27:48.966 --> 27:52.367
I think that guy just laughed at me.
Who are these guys?

27:52.469 --> 27:54.369
They go by "Devil Babies."

27:54.471 --> 27:56.496
They finished third
in the National Championship.

27:56.607 --> 27:58.268
This should be an excellent test
of our skills.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.468
-Wait. These guys are champions?
-All right, all right.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.273
They didn't win it.

28:03.681 --> 28:04.670
Go!

28:05.115 --> 28:06.309
Move, move, move!

28:06.417 --> 28:07.748
Let's go!

28:09.954 --> 28:11.353
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

28:11.589 --> 28:12.556
Oh, my God!

28:12.857 --> 28:14.757
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

28:19.330 --> 28:21.628
There you are! Look alive!

28:22.199 --> 28:23.166
I'm out.

28:25.069 --> 28:26.502
-Watch out!
-Watch it!

28:26.604 --> 28:28.196
Come on, blondie!

28:43.954 --> 28:45.182
Am I out?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.466
I didn't know they sold beer here.

29:00.670 --> 29:01.796
They don't.

29:04.674 --> 29:07.609
There you go! Stay down, Paula!
Stay down!

29:11.648 --> 29:13.138
Can I have one?

29:14.918 --> 29:15.907
No.

29:16.119 --> 29:17.211
Check it out!

29:27.297 --> 29:28.764
Warm day, huh?

29:36.639 --> 29:38.106
Nice talking to you.

29:41.945 --> 29:43.242
Damn it!

29:43.880 --> 29:44.904
Paula?

29:45.014 --> 29:46.606
Sorry! Sorry!

29:46.716 --> 29:48.581
Does it count if it was an accident?

29:49.786 --> 29:51.014
Bad finger roll.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.985
All right, I need you to come to me.

29:53.089 --> 29:55.990
No, thanks. I'm just gonna
stay over here till it's over.

29:56.092 --> 29:57.116
-Now!
-Okay.

30:01.597 --> 30:02.586
I'm out.

30:04.968 --> 30:06.367
Shit! I'm out!

30:06.469 --> 30:09.063
-You will not have died in vain!
-Stay down.

30:09.172 --> 30:11.197
Paula, where are you?

30:11.708 --> 30:14.006
Finger roll. Finger roll. Finger roll.

30:14.110 --> 30:18.069
Oh, Tinkerbell!
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

30:19.148 --> 30:21.810
The sooner you lose,
the sooner you can go shopping!

30:24.454 --> 30:25.819
Oh, man!

30:26.055 --> 30:27.920
Who's laughing now?

30:31.760 --> 30:33.091
You did it!

30:34.629 --> 30:35.994
-Get out of here!
-Boy, you made it!

30:36.098 --> 30:37.156
Come on!

30:37.265 --> 30:38.493
Where'd that come from?

30:38.633 --> 30:40.191
-Look at you!
-I love it.

30:40.302 --> 30:41.667
-Hey, Kit!
-Kind of fun, huh?

30:41.770 --> 30:44.398
You know what?
I'm gonna go powder my nose.

30:45.507 --> 30:47.975
I take it you're over
your dead golden retriever.

30:48.076 --> 30:50.909
You know, if I really had a dog
and he really had died,

30:51.013 --> 30:53.379
I think this would have totally helped.

30:53.482 --> 30:55.780
Man, she's got good spatial awareness.

30:56.018 --> 30:57.076
And great hair!

30:57.185 --> 30:58.777
-Thanks.
-She's a keeper, man.

30:58.887 --> 31:00.980
She's really great. Really great, Tripp.

31:01.089 --> 31:02.681
So can we go now?

31:03.592 --> 31:05.059
Meeting the friends is very important.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.128
Guys need to know
we not only like them,

31:07.229 --> 31:09.197
but we like their friends, too.

31:09.297 --> 31:12.266
Fine. The tall one's kind of cute.
What's he do?

31:12.367 --> 31:13.925
Oh, he's some kind of software writer.

31:14.036 --> 31:15.663
He works out of his basement,
but he makes a lot of money.

31:15.771 --> 31:17.432
Oh, you know what?
No, that's the little guy.

31:17.539 --> 31:20.201
The tall one just got fired from Kinko's.

31:22.077 --> 31:23.601
How will I choose?

31:23.712 --> 31:25.236
This is going very well.

31:25.347 --> 31:27.474
Good. So we can go now.

31:28.250 --> 31:30.013
Not until I get "the nod."

31:30.118 --> 31:33.315
If I don't get "the nod,"
the friends undermine.

31:35.223 --> 31:37.191
I think you're getting "the nod."

31:39.594 --> 31:40.561
Oh, yeah.

31:40.929 --> 31:43.762
Oh, Tripp is just cruising
through the steps.

31:43.865 --> 31:48.165
In fact, I think tomorrow
I'm gonna let him teach me something.

32:00.881 --> 32:03.281
Now, basically there's two ways
to turn a boat.

32:03.984 --> 32:06.384
There's "coming about,"
which is turning into the wind,

32:06.487 --> 32:08.717
and there's "jibing,"
which is turning away from the wind.

32:08.823 --> 32:11.758
Now, jibing is something that you
never want to do with a rookie onboard,

32:11.859 --> 32:13.622
so let's give it a shot, huh?

32:13.727 --> 32:16.127
Well, wait, wait, wait.
Why is jibing bad?

32:16.230 --> 32:18.562
It's not bad, it's just fun. Jibe ho!

32:18.666 --> 32:20.691
Come on, babe! Let's get over there!

32:25.106 --> 32:26.664
Come on, boy!

32:32.847 --> 32:33.973
Oh, my God!

32:34.715 --> 32:37.878
Nothing like the threat of decapitation
to make it a little more interesting.

32:40.187 --> 32:43.384
Make off this sheet, like so.

32:46.460 --> 32:47.427
Okay.

32:48.896 --> 32:51.387
"Jibe ho" and "making off the sheet"?

32:51.499 --> 32:55.060
That's too many words to learn.
I just want to get a suntan.

32:55.503 --> 32:56.561
Here, take the wheel.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.365
What? Really?

32:58.472 --> 32:59.461
Oh, yeah.

32:59.573 --> 33:00.597
All right.

33:00.708 --> 33:02.437
-We call it the helm.
-Okay.

33:02.543 --> 33:03.908
Wait, wait, wait! What are you doing?

33:04.011 --> 33:05.308
I'm going down below.

33:05.679 --> 33:06.737
What's down below?

33:06.847 --> 33:08.576
I don't know, beer, wine, chips, rum.

33:08.682 --> 33:10.309
I don't know. It's not my boat.

33:10.518 --> 33:12.645
But I don't know what I'm doing!
I'm not kidding! Seriously!

33:12.753 --> 33:14.015
You're sailing!

33:14.121 --> 33:15.588
What if I hit something?

33:21.829 --> 33:23.797
I think you'll be okay. Fly.

33:24.465 --> 33:25.432
Wow.

33:27.201 --> 33:28.259
I'm sailing.

33:43.016 --> 33:44.142
Oh, man.

33:44.884 --> 33:46.647
That's gorgeous!

33:56.863 --> 34:00.299
You know, I thought going on a boat
was a good idea because you like it,

34:00.400 --> 34:03.563
but my God! That was great!

34:03.770 --> 34:07.638
You should buy that boat! I mean,
I'm sure it's expensive, but so what?

34:08.875 --> 34:11.536
Well, I like that boat, but I really don't...

34:11.811 --> 34:12.971
Nice.

34:14.013 --> 34:15.674
I don't really want a new boat.

34:15.782 --> 34:18.808
What I would love
is an old wooden boat.

34:18.985 --> 34:22.751
Now, they're a lot more upkeep,
but when you're on one of those,

34:22.989 --> 34:25.856
it's like you're part of something,
you know?

34:27.327 --> 34:30.989
It's like you're connected, you know,
to the original seafaring people

34:31.097 --> 34:33.360
who set sail into the unknown
and said things like,

34:33.466 --> 34:35.559
"Holy crap, that's a big wave!"

34:37.570 --> 34:39.936
So do it. Buy a crummy old boat.

34:40.373 --> 34:42.101
Who cares,
as long as you're out there?

34:42.208 --> 34:44.301
Well, I'm working on it.

34:45.178 --> 34:47.806
The thing is, you gotta be ready.
I mean, it's a big commitment.

34:47.914 --> 34:50.007
And if you're not ready, you just end up,

34:50.116 --> 34:52.949
well, a Ionely guy
with a big boat payment.

34:53.286 --> 34:55.117
Who says you have to be Ionely?

35:25.250 --> 35:27.775
-Hey.
-Oh, hey! Hi!

35:27.886 --> 35:29.114
I didn't know you were home.

35:29.221 --> 35:32.213
Yeah, everyone from work
went to T.G.I. Friday's,

35:32.324 --> 35:34.622
but I don't really like that place.

35:34.726 --> 35:36.887
-Or anyone I work with.
-Oh, good.

35:36.995 --> 35:40.055
So then we can stay in and watch
one of those drinking movies you like.

35:40.165 --> 35:41.291
Yeah.

35:45.771 --> 35:47.238
I smell something.

35:48.073 --> 35:49.665
Do you smell something?

35:51.743 --> 35:54.337
Oh, Tripp and I had crab today.

35:54.646 --> 35:56.273
No, that's not it.

35:57.282 --> 35:59.113
I smell fun.

36:01.453 --> 36:02.511
What?

36:02.621 --> 36:05.112
You are a dirty little fun-haver.

36:05.223 --> 36:08.818
That is absurd.
Tripp is a fascinating case.

36:08.927 --> 36:11.418
He doesn't fit the usual profile.

36:11.530 --> 36:12.554
Of losers and shut-ins?

36:12.664 --> 36:14.757
I actually don't even see
why he still lives at home.

36:14.866 --> 36:17.460
He's got a good job,
he's got normal social skills,

36:17.569 --> 36:19.730
he's attractive,

36:20.138 --> 36:22.106
he's really sweet.

36:24.443 --> 36:28.937
That's so nice that you get to hang out
with such a sweet guy every day.

36:32.451 --> 36:36.819
It was a rewarding
and successful work day. That's all.

36:36.921 --> 36:37.888
Okay.

36:37.988 --> 36:41.651
And at the end of it,
I looked into his eyes,

36:42.326 --> 36:43.293
and I saw it.

36:44.328 --> 36:45.761
I've got him.

36:46.397 --> 36:49.560
He is as good as moved out.

36:50.968 --> 36:53.528
It's over. She's gotta go.

36:53.704 --> 36:54.864
You're dumping Paula?

36:54.972 --> 36:57.497
-What happened?
-Same thing that always happens.

36:57.608 --> 36:59.166
Everything is going along
nice and smooth,

36:59.276 --> 37:00.265
we're having a good time,

37:00.378 --> 37:02.846
and all of a sudden, out of nowhere...

37:03.147 --> 37:04.273
She gets serious.

37:04.382 --> 37:08.113
I hate to say it, boys,
but it is time to take the girl home.

37:08.219 --> 37:09.948
-You're doing it again.
-What?

37:10.054 --> 37:13.990
The thing where the woman gets close
and you pull the relationship ripcord.

37:14.091 --> 37:16.491
Guys, it's simple. The fun's gone.

37:17.595 --> 37:19.586
Hey, guys, check this out!

37:21.432 --> 37:22.660
Hey, boy!

37:24.368 --> 37:26.632
Come here, boy. Come here, boy.

37:27.838 --> 37:29.066
What's he saying, Demo?

37:31.909 --> 37:32.933
Where'd you go?

37:33.043 --> 37:34.067
Where'd he go?

37:34.178 --> 37:36.373
-Let me ask you something, Demo.
-Yeah.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.108
How's this surfing
if there are no waves?

37:41.986 --> 37:42.953
Tripp?

37:49.393 --> 37:50.553
Should we go after him?

37:50.661 --> 37:51.821
Well, he's their passenger now.

37:51.929 --> 37:55.126
Passenger?
He just took him underwater!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.061
Take me!

38:00.604 --> 38:01.832
Oh, shit!

38:02.306 --> 38:04.796
Oh, shit! The son of a bitch bit me!

38:07.710 --> 38:09.871
So you were bit by a dolphin?

38:09.979 --> 38:13.107
Yeah. And not just any dolphin, either.

38:13.216 --> 38:15.878
This was a great white dolphin,
all right?

38:16.753 --> 38:18.448
I'm lucky to still be here.

38:23.927 --> 38:25.087
What?

38:27.497 --> 38:28.691
Nothing.

38:32.869 --> 38:33.836
Wow!

38:34.637 --> 38:36.366
-This is your house?
-Yeah.

38:36.473 --> 38:38.373
-It's beautiful.
-Thank you.

38:38.942 --> 38:41.433
I like to come home to a nice place.

38:43.613 --> 38:45.808
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

38:48.384 --> 38:50.011
-It's very pretty.
-Thank you.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.848
-You want something to drink?
-Yeah, sure.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.422
Beer? Glass of wine?

38:53.523 --> 38:55.115
-Sure, wine would be great, thanks.
-Glass of wine.

38:55.225 --> 38:56.192
Thanks.

38:56.392 --> 38:59.259
Hey, Mom, Pop,
I thought y'all were going out.

38:59.362 --> 39:03.162
Out? What would we go out for?
We've got those brand-new chairs!

39:04.934 --> 39:06.060
Hello.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.331
Tripp, who's your little friend?

39:12.442 --> 39:13.932
Mom, Dad, this is Paula.

39:14.043 --> 39:17.570
Paula, this is my mom, my dad,
Sue and Al.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.347
Wow! Well!

39:20.450 --> 39:22.179
-Hello. How do you do?
-Hello.

39:22.285 --> 39:23.445
Hi.

39:24.254 --> 39:26.245
It's a great pleasure to meet you both.

39:26.356 --> 39:27.653
Hi, Paula.

39:29.626 --> 39:30.593
Wow.

39:37.599 --> 39:38.725
So you...

39:39.334 --> 39:41.029
You live with your parents.

39:44.273 --> 39:45.604
Is that a problem?

39:52.548 --> 39:54.106
No.

39:55.617 --> 39:56.879
Not for me.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.420
Would you like to stay for dinner?

40:00.556 --> 40:03.582
Oh! Wow. I'd love to. Thank you.

40:03.692 --> 40:04.954
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Why?

40:05.060 --> 40:08.655
Well, it smells good,
and I'm really hungry. Aren't you?

40:08.764 --> 40:11.927
Yeah, I'm hungry.
But my mom here, she's cooking dinner.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.524
Like she does most nights.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.363
Right here, where I live,

40:15.470 --> 40:16.698
with them,

40:17.873 --> 40:20.137
in the same house I grew up in.

40:20.776 --> 40:22.175
That's nice.

40:23.445 --> 40:25.242
I'm gonna go mow the lawn.

40:25.380 --> 40:27.177
Well, we're about to sit down...

40:27.282 --> 40:29.477
Might mow the neighbor's, too.

40:31.286 --> 40:34.153
Is this really okay? 'Cause I don't want
to intrude on family time.

40:34.256 --> 40:36.554
Oh, it's fine. I'll set another place.

40:36.658 --> 40:38.091
Okay, thanks.

40:40.095 --> 40:41.926
I'm gonna go help Dad.

40:42.798 --> 40:43.765
Is there...

40:44.866 --> 40:46.265
Is there anything I can do to help?

40:46.368 --> 40:48.734
Listen, I am so sorry.

40:48.837 --> 40:52.238
I had no idea that he was
going to bring me over here.

40:52.541 --> 40:54.736
But you are doing great.

40:54.843 --> 40:57.869
Well, you're not.
I don't know what to tell you, honey,

40:57.980 --> 41:00.346
but that strict program of yours?

41:00.882 --> 41:02.975
You're gonna have to start deviating.

41:03.085 --> 41:04.416
He's breaking up with you.

41:04.519 --> 41:05.508
What?

41:05.621 --> 41:08.020
The only reason
he ever brings girls home to meet us

41:08.122 --> 41:09.919
is 'cause he's getting ready
to dump them.

41:10.024 --> 41:11.184
Really?

41:12.927 --> 41:13.894
Well,

41:14.795 --> 41:15.887
that's not happening.

41:19.867 --> 41:22.665
-Hey, Paula? Hey, sweetie?
-Yes?

41:22.770 --> 41:26.297
I appreciate you staying
for dinner, all right?

41:26.407 --> 41:27.965
And I know that must have been
very awkward.

41:28.075 --> 41:29.372
Not at all.

41:29.477 --> 41:30.739
Not at all?

41:35.216 --> 41:37.548
You don't mind that my parents
are downstairs right now?

41:37.652 --> 41:39.483
They're asleep in their chairs.

41:41.288 --> 41:42.414
Don't stare.

41:43.157 --> 41:46.024
I'm paying for it. I'll stare if I want to.

41:50.064 --> 41:52.362
I'm just saying, you know, they might...

41:52.800 --> 41:54.563
They might hear us.

41:54.669 --> 41:57.502
Why? Are you a screamer?

42:33.107 --> 42:34.233
Paula?

42:37.478 --> 42:40.605
Hey, you're up! Wow, early risers.

42:40.714 --> 42:43.478
Hey, listen.
FYI, work-wise, we're definitely on track.

42:43.583 --> 42:45.050
Things are good. Tripp is good.

42:45.151 --> 42:46.812
Well, actually, he's fantastic.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.150
Of course, I don't need to tell you that.
You're his parents.

42:49.255 --> 42:53.385
I'm just trying to say, you should be
very proud of him.

42:54.627 --> 42:55.594
Well...

42:56.396 --> 42:58.227
You got a lovely home.

43:07.038 --> 43:08.972
I'm sorry, miss, you're not allowed
to eat that in the store.

43:09.073 --> 43:10.131
Fine.

43:37.234 --> 43:40.135
I need to buy a gun.
How much is this big gun here?

43:40.237 --> 43:43.968
That's a 12-gauge shotgun.
That's a pretty powerful weapon.

43:44.075 --> 43:45.565
You know, for a woman your size,

43:45.676 --> 43:48.042
I'd probably recommend something
a little, you know...

43:48.145 --> 43:49.134
More compact?

43:49.246 --> 43:52.409
So I just point, and then I squeeze
the trigger and then boom.

43:52.516 --> 43:55.246
Yeah. What did you say
you were shooting?

43:55.353 --> 43:59.050
Twelve hundred bucks? Wow.
How much are the bullets for this?

44:02.727 --> 44:05.696
Shells. Shotguns use shells.
Anyway. Whatever.

44:05.796 --> 44:07.787
They're 15 bucks for a box of 25.

44:07.898 --> 44:10.661
Okay, I don't need a whole box.
I just need...

44:12.135 --> 44:13.102
one.

44:16.172 --> 44:17.139
You know,

44:20.343 --> 44:22.334
I get sad sometimes, too.

44:23.813 --> 44:26.304
So many pressures in life, you know?

44:26.950 --> 44:30.181
Can I give you a phone number
for some people who can help...

44:30.286 --> 44:31.810
Oh, no.

44:31.921 --> 44:33.252
It's like a hotline.

44:33.356 --> 44:36.723
Listen, sunshine, I'm not

44:36.826 --> 44:38.453
-suicidal.
-No, I know.

44:38.561 --> 44:42.190
I just have a problem
with a mockingbird.

44:42.565 --> 44:43.862
Okay,

44:43.967 --> 44:47.061
-you can't kill a mockingbird.
-Why not?

44:47.170 --> 44:50.037
<i>Well, for one, there's the book
To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

44:50.507 --> 44:52.202
A copy of that, too, right here.

44:52.308 --> 44:56.506
No, it's not a manual
on how to kill mockingbirds.

44:56.613 --> 44:59.946
It's a classic American novel.
How do you not know this?

45:00.717 --> 45:02.446
I know a lot of other things.
Give me the gun!

45:02.552 --> 45:03.541
-No!
-Yes!

45:03.653 --> 45:04.950
I'm not gonna sell you this gun.

45:05.055 --> 45:08.047
Mockingbirds are protected under
the Federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

45:08.158 --> 45:09.250
Killing one is a crime.

45:09.359 --> 45:11.122
Look, this is insane.

45:11.261 --> 45:12.660
I have rights, too, you know.

45:12.762 --> 45:15.094
Or maybe you haven't heard
of the Sixth Amendment!

45:15.198 --> 45:17.723
The right to a speedy and public trial?

45:19.502 --> 45:21.436
You. You're on my list,

45:21.671 --> 45:22.638
Jim.

45:22.839 --> 45:26.297
I got great boat shoes.

45:26.409 --> 45:27.398
Hi.

45:28.445 --> 45:30.413
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

45:30.513 --> 45:33.141
I got shoes for the next time
Tripp and I go sailing.

45:33.249 --> 45:34.944
And they're not just cute.

45:35.051 --> 45:36.518
Tripp says they're actually
very practical.

45:36.619 --> 45:37.916
They have these little ridges
on the bottom...

45:38.021 --> 45:39.579
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

45:39.689 --> 45:40.747
Look at me.

45:40.857 --> 45:44.223
-What happened last night?
-What happened last night?

45:44.626 --> 45:46.253
I tried to end it.

45:46.462 --> 45:48.327
Tried, as in "you failed"?

45:48.430 --> 45:49.522
Yeah.

45:50.432 --> 45:52.764
But the sex was fantastic.

45:52.868 --> 45:54.631
You had sex with him?

45:54.737 --> 45:57.535
This is not a big deal.

45:57.639 --> 46:01.336
What was that rule that you had about
never ever having sex with clients?

46:01.443 --> 46:04.469
Oh, yeah,
"I never ever have sex with my clients."

46:04.580 --> 46:07.674
Those are my rules.
I can change them if I need to.

46:07.783 --> 46:09.648
It's not like I don't know what I'm doing.

46:09.752 --> 46:11.014
So your parents weren't home?

46:11.120 --> 46:12.849
No, they were downstairs.

46:16.091 --> 46:17.888
-And you were upstairs?
-Yeah.

46:18.193 --> 46:20.320
Look, I am still in control.

46:20.429 --> 46:24.456
This was a one-time
emergency situation.

46:24.566 --> 46:26.193
You know what? It's very complicated.

46:26.301 --> 46:29.293
I don't have time right now
to explain to you how business works.

46:29.404 --> 46:32.237
You don't need to explain to me
how business works. I'm not an idiot.

46:32.341 --> 46:33.603
Do you know that I have a contract?

46:33.709 --> 46:38.612
I have fiduciary responsibilities
to uphold.

46:38.714 --> 46:41.512
From a fiduciary standpoint,
would you say that you had an orgasm?

46:43.886 --> 46:45.820
Come on! Were we talking to you?

46:45.921 --> 46:47.047
No. Clean that mess up.

46:47.156 --> 46:49.920
Hey, hey! Hey. Can we please
discuss this someplace else?

46:51.393 --> 46:54.055
That's okay, you guys can stay here
if you want.

46:57.099 --> 46:58.430
What are you gonna do now?

46:58.534 --> 46:59.660
I don't know.

47:00.903 --> 47:03.371
I'm in uncharted waters here, boys.

47:04.373 --> 47:07.069
My mom thinks it's her dog,
but I do all the work.

47:07.176 --> 47:08.609
I mean, you don't brush an Irish setter...

47:08.710 --> 47:10.575
-You have an Irish setter?
-Yeah!

47:10.679 --> 47:11.941
I have a yellow Lab!

47:12.047 --> 47:13.809
I mean, he's getting kind of old,

47:13.915 --> 47:15.678
but we should definitely
get them together.

47:15.783 --> 47:17.148
We should...

47:17.518 --> 47:20.646
God, I'm so lucky. I mean, I'm so lucky.

47:20.755 --> 47:23.747
I mean, look at you, and look at me.

47:23.858 --> 47:25.985
Hey, I mean, come on, look at you.

47:26.093 --> 47:28.823
You're smart, you're attractive,

47:28.930 --> 47:31.398
<i>you love the original Star Wars trilogy,</i>

47:31.499 --> 47:34.935
because it's all about
storytelling, and myth,

47:35.036 --> 47:37.163
before CGI ruined everything.

47:37.271 --> 47:40.206
I mean, come on, what girl
wouldn't want to be with you?

47:40.308 --> 47:42.003
A shocking number, actually.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.474
Well, you know what? It's their loss.

47:43.578 --> 47:45.011
<i>You show me a guy who loves Empire</i>

47:45.112 --> 47:48.240
and I will show you a guy
who's not afraid of his imagination.

47:48.482 --> 47:51.815
Like with Luke gets to the cave,
and he asks Yoda what's in there,

47:51.919 --> 47:53.409
and Yoda says...

47:53.821 --> 47:56.813
"Only what you take with you."

47:57.258 --> 48:01.490
But he goes in anyway, because
he is not afraid of his own mind!

48:01.596 --> 48:03.791
Walking the path of the Jedi, that's why.

48:03.898 --> 48:07.425
That's you! You're Luke!

48:10.638 --> 48:11.764
I gotta pee.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.364
Didn't you just go?

48:13.474 --> 48:15.169
Listen, listen, I'll be right back.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.799
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

48:16.911 --> 48:18.173
I'm not gonna go anywhere.

48:18.279 --> 48:19.371
All right, cool.

48:20.047 --> 48:21.912
But, really, don't go anywhere.

48:35.696 --> 48:36.685
Hiya, Paula.

48:36.797 --> 48:37.821
Oh, God!

48:37.932 --> 48:39.126
Shit!

48:39.834 --> 48:42.098
You scared the crap out of me.

48:43.404 --> 48:46.770
What you doing?
This isn't your usual place, is it?

48:47.474 --> 48:50.136
Just, you know, just...

48:50.577 --> 48:52.374
having lunch with a friend.

48:54.214 --> 48:56.705
You always hold your friends' hands?

48:57.617 --> 48:59.676
Like, then I touched...
We touched hand.

48:59.786 --> 49:01.310
I just touched his hand.

49:01.421 --> 49:03.514
Well, my friends never touch my hands.

49:08.128 --> 49:11.757
You've put me
in a very difficult position here.

49:15.635 --> 49:17.262
Okay, look, what do you want?

49:22.208 --> 49:23.197
No.

49:23.310 --> 49:25.938
It's just coffee.
You don't have to marry him.

49:26.046 --> 49:28.810
First of all,
that's the geeky computer guy.

49:28.915 --> 49:31.884
It's bad enough I have to go out
with a loser who still lives with his mom,

49:31.985 --> 49:35.819
but you led me to believe that it was
the handsome minimum-wage slacker.

49:37.257 --> 49:40.226
No, I don't think that I did that.

49:41.227 --> 49:42.717
Okay, I didn't have a choice.

49:42.829 --> 49:43.887
He was going to tell Tripp

49:43.997 --> 49:46.158
and you were the only
bargaining chip that I had.

49:46.266 --> 49:47.927
You should take that as a compliment.

49:48.034 --> 49:49.228
He's a troll.

49:49.336 --> 49:51.600
He's not a troll. He's... He's...

49:52.572 --> 49:56.064
He's endearing, and quirky.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.009
Oh, for Christ's sake.

49:59.212 --> 50:00.543
I'm coming!

50:06.186 --> 50:07.380
Damn it.

50:15.260 --> 50:16.386
I hope you like fish.

50:17.796 --> 50:19.593
So how does Paula do it, anyway?

50:19.698 --> 50:21.393
It seems like it would be hard on her.

50:21.500 --> 50:23.798
Does she ever get it confused
with her real life?

50:23.902 --> 50:26.700
What makes you think
she has a real life?

50:29.008 --> 50:31.169
It's just kind of a weird job.

50:31.410 --> 50:33.503
I mean, how does one
get into that field?

50:35.614 --> 50:37.673
A couple of years ago, she fell for a guy

50:37.783 --> 50:39.808
who wouldn't move out
of his parents' house.

50:39.918 --> 50:42.079
I don't know, I guess
because she couldn't fix him,

50:42.187 --> 50:44.485
she has to fix
all the other losers out there.

50:45.891 --> 50:46.983
No offense.

50:47.893 --> 50:48.951
None taken.

50:49.828 --> 50:51.819
Listen, if you want to go, that's okay.

50:52.131 --> 50:54.258
I'm sorry I slammed the door
on your face.

50:54.366 --> 50:56.459
I don't sleep much.

50:58.971 --> 50:59.960
Really?

51:00.606 --> 51:01.732
Me, either.

51:02.508 --> 51:05.341
Just have too much stuff going on
in my head. Is that the same thing?

51:05.444 --> 51:06.604
No, no.

51:07.880 --> 51:11.043
No. No. I want to sleep,

51:11.150 --> 51:13.550
but I can't, because there's a bird
outside my window

51:13.652 --> 51:16.314
and all night long it chirps,
and it chirps, and it chirps,

51:16.422 --> 51:18.947
and it's annoying,
and I can't get it to shut up!

51:23.962 --> 51:25.429
I have a BB gun.

51:33.539 --> 51:35.302
Go, Omaha!

51:38.043 --> 51:39.010
Yeah.

51:39.778 --> 51:41.643
Say, did you get my message today?

51:43.882 --> 51:45.179
No. You know what,
I had my phone turned off.

51:45.284 --> 51:48.150
I was having lunch with a girlfriend.

51:48.653 --> 51:51.019
My teacher, Miss Kramer,
has a girlfriend.

51:51.489 --> 51:52.820
Oh! That's nice.

51:52.924 --> 51:54.016
She's a lesbian.

51:54.892 --> 51:56.757
Well, don't act all cool about it!

51:57.228 --> 51:58.718
You're jealous 'cause you like her.

51:58.830 --> 52:01.196
You're the one
who was always staring at her shirt.

52:02.166 --> 52:03.155
He's lying.

52:12.477 --> 52:14.001
I don't hear anything.

52:15.947 --> 52:17.141
He'll come.

52:18.583 --> 52:20.107
He always comes.

52:21.686 --> 52:23.347
How many times did you pump it?

52:25.857 --> 52:27.620
-Twice.
-Good.

52:27.725 --> 52:31.661
'Cause we don't want to kill it,
just sting it so it flies away.

52:33.131 --> 52:34.098
Yeah.

52:35.900 --> 52:39.836
So, is Kit short for Katherine?

52:41.038 --> 52:44.735
Yes. Is Ace short for

52:45.643 --> 52:47.008
Ace-a-rooney?

52:47.211 --> 52:49.042
No, it's a nickname.

52:49.147 --> 52:51.479
What, are you really good at cards
or something?

52:52.617 --> 52:56.576
Until I was 10,
I had an undescended testicle.

53:04.061 --> 53:05.119
Wait!

53:08.166 --> 53:09.190
There you are.

53:10.134 --> 53:11.761
Say good night, birdie.

53:14.672 --> 53:15.730
I got him!

53:18.508 --> 53:20.738
You pumped it more than twice,
didn't you?

53:23.013 --> 53:25.607
Oh, my God!
God, why'd you make me do that?

53:26.650 --> 53:28.083
-Clear the table!
-Oh, God!

53:28.318 --> 53:30.081
-Oh, my God! Is he okay?
-I don't know.

53:30.187 --> 53:31.381
-Where's he hit?
-I don't know!

53:31.488 --> 53:33.183
-Is he dead?
-I...

53:33.290 --> 53:34.257
Oh, no!

53:34.758 --> 53:37.852
Look! Look! The BB.

53:38.228 --> 53:40.253
Well, maybe it's just stunned.
Do you know CPR?

53:40.363 --> 53:41.694
-Well, yeah, but...
-Do it!

53:42.065 --> 53:43.191
-It's a bird!
-Do it!

53:43.300 --> 53:46.667
Okay. Check vitals. Where's the pulse?

53:47.304 --> 53:48.862
-Gently.
-Open the airway.

53:49.139 --> 53:50.902
-Don't hurt him!
-I'm not hurting him!

53:51.007 --> 53:51.974
God!

53:52.609 --> 53:53.576
Okay. Be careful with him.

53:53.677 --> 53:54.735
-He's little.
-I don't know.

53:54.844 --> 53:57.438
Oh, my God, it's not working!
He's going!

53:57.547 --> 53:59.344
Do something! We're losing him!

53:59.449 --> 54:00.609
Not on my watch!

54:04.254 --> 54:06.051
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand.

54:06.156 --> 54:07.783
Walk away from the light, little buddy!

54:09.659 --> 54:11.593
One, one thousand, two, one thousand,
three, one thousand!

54:11.695 --> 54:12.662
Please, God!

54:15.031 --> 54:17.158
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! He's alive!

54:29.512 --> 54:30.536
What the...

54:42.659 --> 54:43.921
I'm hungry.

54:44.027 --> 54:47.963
Captain, you just had nachos,
two hot dogs, and a bag of peanuts.

54:48.331 --> 54:50.264
I didn't have ice cream.

54:50.466 --> 54:51.831
My bad.

54:51.934 --> 54:53.401
Fine. Can I have a fruit bar?

54:53.502 --> 54:54.469
Now you're getting good.

54:54.570 --> 54:56.401
That's good. A negotiator here. All right.

54:56.572 --> 54:57.800
Hey, wait for me.

54:59.174 --> 55:01.233
Let's check with Miss Paula,
see if she needs anything.

55:01.343 --> 55:04.210
Maybe a Royal's Number One
foam finger.

55:04.313 --> 55:05.780
Don't come back without a foam finger.

55:05.881 --> 55:07.075
You got it.

55:15.024 --> 55:16.924
Tripp and Jeffrey are very cute together,
aren't they?

55:17.026 --> 55:19.187
-Yeah. Listen, while we have a minute,
-Yeah?

55:19.295 --> 55:20.728
...I really want to talk to you
about the whole

55:20.829 --> 55:22.729
dating-my-best-friend-for-money thing.

55:23.565 --> 55:25.055
-What?
-So, this must be the date

55:25.167 --> 55:27.567
where you show that you share
the guy's intense passion for something

55:27.670 --> 55:29.604
that, really, you don't have
the slightest interest in.

55:30.372 --> 55:32.431
Okay, look, I don't know
what you heard, but...

55:32.541 --> 55:33.769
Ace told me everything.

55:35.210 --> 55:37.235
Don't worry, I haven't ratted you out.

55:38.547 --> 55:40.947
Truth is, I support your overall goal.

55:42.251 --> 55:45.220
But if you really want to help him,
and I think you do,

55:45.321 --> 55:46.845
you have to have all the facts.

55:47.089 --> 55:49.649
Starting with the fact
that Jeffrey's not Tripp's nephew.

55:51.327 --> 55:52.385
You ever heard of Amy?

55:52.628 --> 55:54.596
Amy is... He's Amy's son.

55:54.763 --> 55:57.994
Amy is Tripp's first love,
and she died six years ago.

55:58.200 --> 55:59.895
He never told you that, did he?

56:02.971 --> 56:04.302
Oh, my God!

56:04.707 --> 56:09.007
I am the worst person in the world.

56:09.712 --> 56:12.772
Oh, hey, you're home. Great.

56:12.981 --> 56:16.849
I have to break up with Tripp.
I'm terminating my contract, and...

56:17.486 --> 56:18.475
I can't do it.

56:19.688 --> 56:20.949
What happened in here?

56:21.055 --> 56:22.488
Nothing. I tripped.

56:23.157 --> 56:24.556
Go on with your story.

56:24.659 --> 56:26.354
Oh. Well,

56:28.463 --> 56:30.090
Tripp was engaged.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.566
-Okay.
-And you know Jeffrey, his nephew?

56:34.902 --> 56:38.167
He's not his nephew.
He's not related to him at all.

56:38.306 --> 56:41.332
Jeffrey is a boy whose mother
was gonna marry Tripp,

56:42.610 --> 56:43.838
and she died.

56:45.646 --> 56:47.113
That's so sad.

56:47.215 --> 56:48.648
God, I know.

56:49.384 --> 56:50.976
Who gives a shit?

56:51.986 --> 56:53.283
I beg your pardon?

56:53.388 --> 56:56.221
Seriously. I've never heard you
talk this way about a client before.

56:56.324 --> 56:57.814
I don't know why you're whining
about this one.

56:57.925 --> 56:59.051
Because...

56:59.861 --> 57:02.386
He's been through an actual tragedy!

57:04.766 --> 57:08.202
This is about Tripp not being
an appropriate client.

57:08.302 --> 57:10.236
It's an ethical problem.

57:13.074 --> 57:14.166
Who's that?

57:16.744 --> 57:17.802
What?

57:19.046 --> 57:20.104
In...

57:21.315 --> 57:22.839
Oh! In...

57:22.950 --> 57:24.178
That's Phillip.

57:24.952 --> 57:26.317
Who's Phillip?

57:27.688 --> 57:29.121
Phillip's...

57:29.290 --> 57:30.518
I... Oh!

57:32.827 --> 57:35.295
Hi, ladies.

57:35.630 --> 57:37.427
Did I say that you could come out?

57:40.401 --> 57:42.562
Well, well, well, well, well.

57:43.604 --> 57:44.901
He's nice.

57:45.006 --> 57:46.371
That's nice.

57:47.642 --> 57:49.940
Look, I don't see
why it's so complicated.

57:50.044 --> 57:52.273
You like Tripp. Tell Tripp you like him.

57:54.047 --> 57:55.344
<i>I gotta tell you something.</i>

57:55.715 --> 57:57.307
I told Paula about Amy.

57:58.418 --> 58:00.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What? What...

58:00.754 --> 58:01.812
Why?

58:01.922 --> 58:03.184
You were never going to.

58:03.490 --> 58:05.117
You never even say her name.

58:05.425 --> 58:08.155
Amy was his ex-fiancée.
She died about six years ago.

58:08.261 --> 58:11.059
To lose love is greatest pain of all.

58:11.164 --> 58:12.153
That's right.

58:12.265 --> 58:14.130
It's okay to cry. We'll turn around.

58:14.234 --> 58:15.724
I'm fine, guys.

58:18.171 --> 58:19.229
Dude.

58:20.874 --> 58:24.002
You had no right to do that, man.
That's my life.

58:24.177 --> 58:25.667
You're right, you're right.
And, normally...

58:25.779 --> 58:27.644
I believe everybody
needs to walk their own path,

58:27.747 --> 58:30.443
but just you're not walking yours. Okay?

58:30.550 --> 58:32.575
You're sitting near the path, on a rock.

58:33.587 --> 58:36.112
This was the only thing I could do,
given the circumstances.

58:36.223 --> 58:37.690
Circumstances?

58:38.558 --> 58:40.526
Brings up the other thing I gotta tell you.

58:41.194 --> 58:43.424
I feel a little bit bad
because I kind of implied to Paula

58:43.530 --> 58:44.758
that I wouldn't say anything, but...

58:44.865 --> 58:46.856
Deception's a poison.
It's like margarine.

58:46.967 --> 58:48.025
I can't have that in my body.

58:48.134 --> 58:50.261
God damn it, Demo, get to the point.
Come on.

58:51.571 --> 58:55.007
Your parents hired Paula to date you
so that you'd move out of their house.

58:56.176 --> 58:57.905
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

58:58.211 --> 59:00.202
They're paying her to be your girlfriend.

59:00.313 --> 59:01.575
-Paula?
-Yeah.

59:01.681 --> 59:04.479
But she's a professional interventionist.
It's her job.

59:04.651 --> 59:05.618
You know?

59:07.888 --> 59:10.982
You're telling me it's not real?

59:11.091 --> 59:14.925
No. No, it's real! It's very real!

59:15.028 --> 59:16.518
Okay, you're upset right now.

59:16.630 --> 59:19.155
I want to encourage you to see past
that bottomless sense of betrayal.

59:19.266 --> 59:20.961
Focus on the future, okay?

59:21.067 --> 59:22.534
'Cause I think you guys
could work things out.

59:22.636 --> 59:25.103
I mean it.
I think you crazy kids have a shot.

59:32.912 --> 59:35.176
So you came home
and he was cooking?

59:35.281 --> 59:36.373
Yeah.

59:36.782 --> 59:37.976
Strange.

59:38.551 --> 59:40.348
-Hey, you know what?
-What?

59:40.452 --> 59:42.886
-Smells good.
-I know!

59:46.392 --> 59:47.381
Can you get that?

59:52.364 --> 59:54.958
Hi. I didn't know that you guys
were gonna be here.

59:55.067 --> 59:57.535
Listen, we didn't, either. Come on in.

59:57.636 --> 59:58.660
Okay. Thank you.

59:58.771 --> 01:00:00.170
Tripp's in the kitchen.

01:00:02.741 --> 01:00:04.231
That does, too.

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:05.877
All right!

01:00:09.782 --> 01:00:10.749
Tripp?

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.615
Hey, there's my girl. Come here, you.

01:00:15.254 --> 01:00:16.915
Hey, what's going on?

01:00:17.022 --> 01:00:18.887
Got a little family dinner.

01:00:19.525 --> 01:00:22.426
All the people that I care about the most

01:00:22.528 --> 01:00:24.928
together in one room. Good times.

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:26.395
Hey.

01:00:26.565 --> 01:00:28.396
Listen, can we talk?

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.559
Absolutely. There's gonna be
plenty of time to talk over dinner.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.534
But right now, I'm cooking.

01:00:33.272 --> 01:00:35.502
<i>Mom, Pop, you want some more vino?</i>

01:00:37.309 --> 01:00:38.503
That's good, that's good.

01:00:38.611 --> 01:00:40.476
Oh, just a little bit more
for the y-o-u, babe.

01:00:40.879 --> 01:00:42.210
Tripp, I don't know what to say.

01:00:42.314 --> 01:00:44.475
Oh, Mom, will you knock that talk off?

01:00:46.552 --> 01:00:48.782
I made this beautiful dinner tonight

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:52.553
to say thank you
to the people that I love the most.

01:00:52.658 --> 01:00:54.420
All of you.

01:00:54.592 --> 01:00:55.889
I'm truly blessed.

01:00:55.994 --> 01:00:58.758
Mom. Pop. Sweetie.

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.325
-That's good, Son.
-Cheers.

01:01:03.901 --> 01:01:05.061
Dig in!

01:01:10.408 --> 01:01:13.002
Hang on. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
I'm too excited.

01:01:13.111 --> 01:01:14.874
I have an announcement to make here.

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:17.047
Okay.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.517
Paula,

01:01:24.088 --> 01:01:25.555
the last couple of weeks

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:29.457
that I've spent with you have been

01:01:30.595 --> 01:01:31.926
amazing,

01:01:32.697 --> 01:01:34.028
surprising,

01:01:35.033 --> 01:01:36.193
joyful,

01:01:37.201 --> 01:01:38.532
surprising.

01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:43.372
I can honestly say that, because of you,

01:01:45.443 --> 01:01:49.470
I've experienced emotions
that I didn't even know I had.

01:01:53.518 --> 01:01:55.110
So call me crazy,

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.844
but I think

01:01:57.221 --> 01:01:58.586
we should move in together.

01:01:59.924 --> 01:02:01.289
That's my boy!

01:02:02.326 --> 01:02:03.850
You okay, baby? Want some water?

01:02:05.063 --> 01:02:06.030
Thank you.

01:02:06.497 --> 01:02:08.328
That's wonderful news.

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:10.429
I am so proud of you, Son.

01:02:10.535 --> 01:02:12.833
Right? And the thing is, Mom, Dad,

01:02:12.937 --> 01:02:16.668
I've lived upstairs since I was three,
and it's been great.

01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:21.333
All right? You two are the best parents
that a boy could ever ask for.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:25.143
I mean, I can only hope that I'm going
to be able to give my kids,

01:02:28.785 --> 01:02:30.013
our kids,

01:02:30.687 --> 01:02:34.316
half of the love, the respect,

01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:36.515
the understanding, the support,

01:02:36.626 --> 01:02:38.491
that you two have given me.

01:02:39.563 --> 01:02:42.464
I guess what I'm saying is,
it is time for Tripp

01:02:44.034 --> 01:02:45.524
to spread his wings.

01:02:51.041 --> 01:02:52.008
Wow.

01:02:53.276 --> 01:02:54.243
Well...

01:02:55.345 --> 01:02:58.212
Well, this is very unexpected.

01:02:58.315 --> 01:02:59.714
So here's the plan, all right?

01:02:59.816 --> 01:03:01.511
We're going to blow out
the east wall of my bedroom,

01:03:01.618 --> 01:03:02.915
enlarge the bathroom,

01:03:03.019 --> 01:03:07.353
and basically turn the entire upstairs
into a secondary master suite

01:03:07.524 --> 01:03:09.515
so there's room for the both of us,

01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:11.284
and the both of you,

01:03:11.394 --> 01:03:12.361
under the same roof.

01:03:12.462 --> 01:03:13.622
What do you say?

01:03:21.605 --> 01:03:24.836
I'm not understanding.
You want Paula to move in here?

01:03:24.941 --> 01:03:27.102
Yes! It's the perfect solution.

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:30.077
Mom, Dad, you like her.
Paula, you like them.

01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:34.207
We're all gonna be right here together
under one roof, a big happy family.

01:03:34.317 --> 01:03:36.285
I'm telling you,
I'm getting really excited about this.

01:03:36.386 --> 01:03:37.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait just a second.

01:03:37.721 --> 01:03:39.188
Take a deep breath here and...

01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:41.519
Tripp, Tripp, I just think
that we should probably talk about this.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:43.388
Just 'cause it's a big idea, and...

01:03:43.493 --> 01:03:45.757
Honey, I've given this
a lot of thought, all right? It'll work!

01:03:46.229 --> 01:03:49.323
And the best part about it is, Mom, Dad,

01:03:51.168 --> 01:03:54.103
you won't have to keep paying Paula
to be my girlfriend.

01:04:00.276 --> 01:04:02.471
What, did I say something wrong?
Come on.

01:04:03.712 --> 01:04:05.339
You're all getting what you wanted.

01:04:06.048 --> 01:04:09.313
Paula, you don't have to pretend
to like me anymore.

01:04:09.485 --> 01:04:12.852
And, Mom, Dad,
you wanted me out of the house.

01:04:16.692 --> 01:04:17.886
I'm out.

01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:34.572
Tripp, wait! Tripp!

01:04:35.711 --> 01:04:36.678
Tripp!

01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:40.347
I don't want to hear it.

01:04:40.816 --> 01:04:42.147
Come on, Tripp.

01:04:44.019 --> 01:04:46.579
Please, you don't understand.

01:04:46.822 --> 01:04:48.380
You're right. Now hold on.

01:04:49.792 --> 01:04:51.851
I don't know what your daily rate is,

01:04:51.961 --> 01:04:54.987
but that's everything
I've got in my wallet. There's $300.

01:04:55.097 --> 01:04:56.564
Oh, come on, Tripp!

01:04:56.665 --> 01:04:59.964
Which should be good for tonight,
especially since we didn't have sex.

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:02.469
Please, Tripp, let me just explain to you.

01:05:02.571 --> 01:05:04.368
Get the fuck out of my car.

01:05:12.047 --> 01:05:13.412
Oh, God.

01:05:55.089 --> 01:05:56.954
So your parents gave her money.

01:05:57.058 --> 01:05:59.151
My grandparents
give my baby-sitter money

01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:00.284
and I still like her.

01:06:00.395 --> 01:06:03.125
Well, good for you, Captain.
Hey, can we talk about something else?

01:06:03.231 --> 01:06:05.722
Fine. The 32 is nice.

01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:10.903
But I think I see myself more in a 37.

01:06:11.439 --> 01:06:12.599
What do you think?

01:06:12.907 --> 01:06:14.340
Don't buy a boat, dude.

01:06:15.443 --> 01:06:17.536
I love...boats.

01:06:17.845 --> 01:06:20.040
No, you don't love boats.

01:06:20.248 --> 01:06:23.046
You love the idea of a boat.

01:06:23.618 --> 01:06:25.279
But the reality is,

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.787
they're just a drain on your time,
your wallet, and your emotions.

01:06:29.357 --> 01:06:31.348
And in the end,
she will break your heart.

01:06:32.293 --> 01:06:34.557
<i>You see, because no matter how much
you care for her,</i>

01:06:34.662 --> 01:06:35.890
<i>she's got no feelings for you.</i>

01:06:35.997 --> 01:06:38.465
<i>I mean, look at her, she's a boat.
She's wood.</i>

01:06:40.234 --> 01:06:42.600
<i>So forget buying a boat.
You want to feel pain?</i>

01:06:43.171 --> 01:06:45.401
You're better off
slamming your hand in a car door.

01:06:47.108 --> 01:06:50.544
You see, that's the stuff that screams,
"I live with my mother."

01:06:50.945 --> 01:06:52.606
-What?
-I mean it.

01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:54.375
I'm telling you as a friend.

01:06:56.684 --> 01:06:58.811
You bring that weak stuff
to the playground,

01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:00.386
you won't last 10 minutes.

01:07:02.122 --> 01:07:04.784
Thank you very much for giving me
a few minutes of your time.

01:07:05.392 --> 01:07:08.452
-Why don't you sit down?
-No, no, no, thank you.

01:07:08.562 --> 01:07:10.427
No, I just want to give you this.

01:07:13.266 --> 01:07:15.029
-What is it?
-It's your money.

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:17.699
I'm returning it.
I know it doesn't fix anything.

01:07:17.804 --> 01:07:19.465
I know that nothing can,

01:07:20.607 --> 01:07:23.770
but given the circumstances,
I don't feel good keeping it, so...

01:07:24.878 --> 01:07:26.106
Really, please take it.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:27.647
Okay.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:30.717
What?

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:32.876
This has never happened before.
I want you to know that.

01:07:32.986 --> 01:07:35.546
He seemed like an open-and-shut case.

01:07:36.523 --> 01:07:39.253
I guess I was overly confident.

01:07:39.526 --> 01:07:40.959
I don't know. And he...

01:07:41.862 --> 01:07:44.422
He won't return
any of my phone calls, and I...

01:07:46.133 --> 01:07:48.397
I keep replaying it over and over
in my mind. I just...

01:07:48.502 --> 01:07:50.197
I don't know where I...

01:07:53.073 --> 01:07:54.836
You're in love with our son.

01:08:06.586 --> 01:08:08.816
Hey, come on, we're gonna go
rock climbing. Get in the car.

01:08:08.922 --> 01:08:09.889
No.

01:08:10.457 --> 01:08:12.288
You've been moping around here
for two weeks.

01:08:12.392 --> 01:08:13.586
Come on, get in.

01:08:14.094 --> 01:08:15.083
Nah.

01:08:15.195 --> 01:08:17.287
Tripp! Come on, it's unlocked.

01:08:17.397 --> 01:08:19.694
It wants you to get in.
Come on. Get in the car, Tripp.

01:08:20.901 --> 01:08:22.630
Isn't this great, guys?

01:08:23.036 --> 01:08:24.765
How you doing up there, Tripp?

01:08:24.871 --> 01:08:27.169
-You feeling it?
-Yeah, baby.

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:29.002
This is a nice rock.

01:08:29.542 --> 01:08:31.510
-Aren't you glad we came?
-Yeah.

01:08:31.609 --> 01:08:34.443
Doing good. This is having fun.
Aren't we?

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:40.408
You guys want any carrots?

01:08:41.252 --> 01:08:43.413
Tripp, you should call Paula.

01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:46.658
-She wants to see you.
-That's enough, Demo!

01:08:48.694 --> 01:08:50.184
A little slack, Ace!

01:08:51.497 --> 01:08:52.622
Here you go.

01:08:55.234 --> 01:08:56.462
Belay on.

01:09:02.608 --> 01:09:04.234
You know, she's hurting, too.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:06.608
She's miserable, Tripp.

01:09:09.915 --> 01:09:11.212
Let it go, guys.

01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.243
Ace!

01:09:30.269 --> 01:09:31.258
My bad.

01:09:31.437 --> 01:09:34.634
<i>I once knew a specialist used to send
some of his patients to me.</i>

01:09:35.006 --> 01:09:36.531
<i>All they needed was a little push.</i>

01:09:37.076 --> 01:09:39.738
Look, Paula, this has to stop.

01:09:40.145 --> 01:09:41.135
You don't sleep,

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:43.807
and the only thing I've seen you eat
in the last three days

01:09:43.916 --> 01:09:45.474
is a bag of Mint Milanos.

01:09:45.718 --> 01:09:48.551
Well, don't worry about me.

01:09:49.354 --> 01:09:51.288
I'll be gone in a couple of weeks.

01:09:52.057 --> 01:09:53.490
What? Where are you going?

01:09:53.591 --> 01:09:55.321
I'm moving back to Colorado.

01:09:56.462 --> 01:09:58.487
What are you gonna do in Colorado?

01:09:58.597 --> 01:10:01.498
-I haven't figured it out.
-Well, that's stupid.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.863
I mean, what are you gonna do
until you figure it out?

01:10:03.968 --> 01:10:05.299
Move in with your parents?

01:10:07.672 --> 01:10:10.937
Oh. That's so wrong.

01:10:11.042 --> 01:10:15.308
Don't judge me, okay?
I mean, you, of all people?

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:16.977
Pretty funny.

01:10:17.081 --> 01:10:19.549
You know what?
I'm the one who's in a real relationship!

01:10:19.651 --> 01:10:21.551
You're the one who lies for a living!

01:10:21.653 --> 01:10:24.417
You think you're so smart,
but you don't know anything!

01:10:24.522 --> 01:10:26.615
Did you really think
you'd never get caught?

01:10:26.724 --> 01:10:28.282
You could've been happy
but you blew it.

01:10:28.393 --> 01:10:30.418
Now you try to act
like it's everyone else's fault,

01:10:30.528 --> 01:10:31.517
but it's all you.

01:10:31.629 --> 01:10:33.597
And now you think
Colorado's the answer?

01:10:33.698 --> 01:10:36.064
You know, Kit,
just because you finally convinced a guy

01:10:36.167 --> 01:10:37.896
to sleep with you more than once

01:10:38.336 --> 01:10:41.203
doesn't make you
an expert on relationships.

01:10:48.713 --> 01:10:50.613
-Tripp!
-Tripp!

01:10:51.115 --> 01:10:52.173
Come on up, buddy.

01:10:52.283 --> 01:10:54.114
-Tripp!
-Tripp?

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.651
Hey! Hey, buddy!

01:10:56.788 --> 01:10:58.756
Come up. There you are.

01:10:59.857 --> 01:11:00.983
-Is he...
-Hey.

01:11:02.093 --> 01:11:03.924
Hey, guys.

01:11:06.064 --> 01:11:07.554
You were bitten by a chuckwalla.

01:11:07.999 --> 01:11:10.160
That shouldn't have happened.
It's a reptile of peace.

01:11:10.301 --> 01:11:11.461
I have a theory.

01:11:11.569 --> 01:11:14.197
This isn't the first time
that nature's lashed out at you like this.

01:11:14.706 --> 01:11:17.174
I believe it's because your life

01:11:17.275 --> 01:11:19.743
is fundamentally at odds
with the natural world.

01:11:20.078 --> 01:11:22.308
-Huh?
-Therefore, nature rejects you.

01:11:24.882 --> 01:11:26.372
You're insane.

01:11:26.918 --> 01:11:28.044
Can I have some water?

01:11:28.152 --> 01:11:29.483
-Yeah.
-Right here.

01:11:29.587 --> 01:11:32.021
-Here we go.
-Okay, okay, easy.

01:11:32.423 --> 01:11:33.946
Look, I've been all over the world.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:36.321
You're the only human to my knowledge
who's been bitten by a dolphin,

01:11:36.426 --> 01:11:38.894
a chipmunk, and a vegetarian lizard
in the same calendar year.

01:11:40.264 --> 01:11:42.129
And you haven't been
a very good friend, either.

01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:44.357
Do you realize that not once
have you asked me

01:11:44.468 --> 01:11:45.958
about my relationship with Kit?

01:11:49.506 --> 01:11:52.907
Dude, did you just drop me
from a 40-foot cliff?

01:11:54.278 --> 01:11:56.371
I mean, you want
to talk about a friend, man,

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.674
you went behind my back,

01:11:57.781 --> 01:12:00.045
and blackmailed your way
into getting your girlfriend.

01:12:00.217 --> 01:12:01.548
He's right.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.350
-I'm sorry I dropped you from a cliff.
-It's okay.

01:12:05.522 --> 01:12:08.389
Granted, he used you,
but not out of malice.

01:12:08.492 --> 01:12:10.483
Look at him.
How many chances is he gonna get?

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:12.255
He saw a chance for love, Tripp,
and he took it.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:14.353
Which is exactly
what we wanted for you.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:16.225
Am I getting advice

01:12:16.333 --> 01:12:18.801
from my two loser buddies
who still live at home?

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.494
Actually, I own my home.

01:12:21.204 --> 01:12:22.728
-What?
-No, you don't.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:24.397
I bought it a couple of years ago
from my mom.

01:12:24.508 --> 01:12:25.566
That way, she has a place to live

01:12:25.676 --> 01:12:27.143
and I don't get nailed
on the inheritance tax.

01:12:27.244 --> 01:12:28.370
-Smart.
-Wow.

01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:31.811
And Demo, here, has chosen
the life of a wanderer.

01:12:31.982 --> 01:12:34.143
I mean, sure,
he technically still lives at home.

01:12:34.251 --> 01:12:36.276
-Yeah.
-But his permanent address

01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:37.580
is in his heart.

01:12:38.288 --> 01:12:39.482
He's a bum.

01:12:41.525 --> 01:12:45.461
I think what we're trying to say
is that the two of us are happy

01:12:45.796 --> 01:12:47.263
and we're perfectly functional.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:51.227
And you, Tripp, are not.

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.572
Mom?

01:13:08.617 --> 01:13:09.641
Pop?

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:27.130
Yeah, baby!

01:13:27.803 --> 01:13:29.065
Hey, Pop.

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.837
Hey! Tripp. What are you doing here?

01:13:32.942 --> 01:13:36.275
Just came by to get some stuff.
What are you doing?

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:37.940
Feeding my fish.

01:13:38.047 --> 01:13:40.447
Yeah. I see that.

01:13:42.885 --> 01:13:45.649
You're naked. In my room.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:49.355
Well, this is my Naked Room.

01:13:50.393 --> 01:13:51.758
I mean, it's my house.

01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:55.895
A man ought to be able to do whatever
he wants to do in his own house.

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.294
Wore a suit for 40 years.

01:13:58.734 --> 01:14:00.725
-So now we got 40 years of...
-No suit.

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.064
No suit.

01:14:03.305 --> 01:14:04.567
All right.

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:06.831
I'm gonna let you get back
to feeding your fish.

01:14:06.942 --> 01:14:08.842
Thanks for stopping by.

01:14:10.613 --> 01:14:14.811
Hey, Pop? Seriously, man,
was it that bad having me around?

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:19.979
Don't be an idiot, Son.
Your mom and I love you.

01:14:20.656 --> 01:14:22.089
Then why didn't you
just say something?

01:14:22.191 --> 01:14:25.092
All you had to do was tell me.

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:28.629
You needed time
after Amy had passed away, Tripp.

01:14:28.731 --> 01:14:31.291
And who knows how much time is right?

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:34.066
Is it two years? Is it six years?

01:14:34.170 --> 01:14:37.400
Then I ran into Bud and Bev Nestor,
and they'd worked with Paula.

01:14:37.639 --> 01:14:40.403
And their son is really happy now.

01:14:40.508 --> 01:14:44.706
Lives in Seattle, I think.
Married an Indian girl.

01:14:45.313 --> 01:14:48.976
Anyway, it just seemed easier.

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.277
Easier.

01:14:53.488 --> 01:14:54.580
All right.

01:14:56.524 --> 01:14:57.786
Hey, man,

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:01.486
I gotta say, I like
what you've done with the place.

01:15:01.596 --> 01:15:04.497
Yeah, I like it. I love you, Son.

01:15:04.599 --> 01:15:06.328
I love you, too. Shake on it.

01:15:07.368 --> 01:15:09.666
Why don't you get back
to scaring those fish, buddy? Huh?

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:10.738
All right.

01:15:11.272 --> 01:15:12.899
Come back anytime, Son.

01:15:13.007 --> 01:15:14.634
Come here. Bucket. Bucket.

01:15:20.114 --> 01:15:21.979
-Hey, Mom.
-Tripp.

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:23.941
You see what's going on upstairs?

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:26.347
Pop's naked, in his Naked Room.

01:15:26.454 --> 01:15:28.319
I know. He's always wanted one.

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:29.981
He tried to take over the dining room

01:15:30.091 --> 01:15:32.992
until I convinced him
that the first floor was problematic.

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:36.988
-You okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:38.899
Just came by to pick up some clothes.

01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:44.234
I'm sorry.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.133
It was a lousy thing to do.

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.681
You know, when we first met Paula,

01:15:55.216 --> 01:15:56.774
when we hired her, I...

01:15:57.385 --> 01:15:59.012
I didn't want you to go.

01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:02.546
For years, I've been dreading
the day you'd leave

01:16:02.657 --> 01:16:06.149
and I always thought
it was 'cause I'd miss you so much.

01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:09.362
Then I realized that
that was only part of it.

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:11.623
I didn't want you to leave because

01:16:12.599 --> 01:16:15.534
being alone with your father
freaks the living shit out of me.

01:16:16.003 --> 01:16:17.903
-What?
-I'm terrified, Tripp!

01:16:18.071 --> 01:16:20.130
And it's not just about the Naked Room.

01:16:20.541 --> 01:16:23.601
Since your father retired, I just...

01:16:24.578 --> 01:16:26.273
I'm used to having you here.

01:16:27.147 --> 01:16:29.377
Like a buffer, you know?
Somebody to talk to

01:16:29.483 --> 01:16:31.951
when your father's all
moody and sullen, and...

01:16:33.387 --> 01:16:34.445
Now I'm...

01:16:34.588 --> 01:16:37.421
We're just gonna have to
get to know each other all over again.

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:39.584
And...

01:16:43.931 --> 01:16:44.989
What?

01:16:48.802 --> 01:16:50.326
What if he doesn't like me?

01:16:54.174 --> 01:16:55.141
Hey.

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:05.074
You still love him, right?

01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:08.846
Against all odds.

01:17:10.591 --> 01:17:12.183
Then you'll figure it out.

01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:17.797
Come here.

01:17:18.899 --> 01:17:20.526
Hey.

01:17:27.774 --> 01:17:29.298
You're gonna miss me.

01:17:30.677 --> 01:17:31.666
That's true.

01:17:32.112 --> 01:17:36.412
I called you all here together
because obviously we have a situation.

01:17:36.516 --> 01:17:40.383
I know we all feel some responsibility,
but this isn't about blame,

01:17:40.486 --> 01:17:42.681
it's about finding a solution.

01:17:43.022 --> 01:17:45.115
Two people we love are hurting.

01:17:45.224 --> 01:17:48.022
So let's put on our thinking caps.

01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:51.152
Man, this shirt feels
like it weighs 100 pounds.

01:17:51.263 --> 01:17:52.423
Albert!

01:17:54.767 --> 01:17:56.291
Okay, how about this?

01:17:56.902 --> 01:18:01.168
We send flowers to Paula from Tripp,

01:18:01.273 --> 01:18:05.801
and flowers to Tripp from Paula.

01:18:07.847 --> 01:18:11.305
-Then what?
-Then they love each other.

01:18:11.417 --> 01:18:12.816
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:18:12.918 --> 01:18:14.385
Because of the flowers!

01:18:15.121 --> 01:18:16.418
Thank you, Phillip.

01:18:16.522 --> 01:18:20.822
Now, let's all try to come up with a plan
that's not so idiotic.

01:18:24.764 --> 01:18:25.731
Hey.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:28.960
Listen,

01:18:31.270 --> 01:18:35.639
I went through all the CDs,
but if you end up with some of mine

01:18:35.741 --> 01:18:37.709
or I end up with some of yours,

01:18:37.810 --> 01:18:39.641
let's just call it even, okay?

01:18:40.212 --> 01:18:41.543
Okay, sure.

01:18:42.148 --> 01:18:43.115
Okay.

01:18:45.217 --> 01:18:46.343
I hate this.

01:18:46.452 --> 01:18:47.749
I know. I do, too.

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:48.987
So...

01:18:50.623 --> 01:18:54.787
So let's just get it over with, then.

01:18:58.898 --> 01:19:00.798
Okay, look, I know I'm a girl

01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:02.891
and I'm supposed to be better
at this emotional crap

01:19:03.002 --> 01:19:05.061
but I'm not, so I'm just gonna say it.

01:19:05.171 --> 01:19:09.471
I'm sorry that I pointed out to you
that you fell in love with a client

01:19:09.575 --> 01:19:12.008
and that made you go crazy
and turn into a total bitch.

01:19:15.513 --> 01:19:16.480
Wow.

01:19:18.383 --> 01:19:21.147
That must've been really hard
for you to say.

01:19:21.252 --> 01:19:25.211
I thought it was going to be, but I just
kind of breezed right through it.

01:19:27.459 --> 01:19:28.892
Well, thanks.

01:19:29.928 --> 01:19:33.386
And I'm sorry that I pointed out

01:19:33.498 --> 01:19:35.762
that you haven't had a real relationship
for the last five years

01:19:35.867 --> 01:19:37.732
because I'm the only person
who can tolerate

01:19:37.836 --> 01:19:39.736
your bizarre and violent mood swings.

01:19:41.172 --> 01:19:43.003
Oh, thank you!

01:19:46.578 --> 01:19:47.567
Goodbye.

01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:48.907
I'm gonna miss you.

01:19:49.013 --> 01:19:50.378
Yeah, I'm going to miss you, too.

01:19:50.982 --> 01:19:53.143
Can I at least give you
a ride to the airport?

01:19:53.251 --> 01:19:54.275
Sure.

01:19:54.419 --> 01:19:56.216
<i>On the way, let's stop at Phillip's,</i>

01:19:56.321 --> 01:19:59.154
<i>so I can give you back
that sweater of yours that you lost.</i>

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:10.631
Wow! This is fantastic!

01:20:10.735 --> 01:20:12.566
-Yeah, it's pretty great.
-Wow.

01:20:12.670 --> 01:20:14.865
At this point, we're just waiting
for his mom to kick it

01:20:14.973 --> 01:20:16.565
so we can move upstairs.

01:20:16.775 --> 01:20:18.333
That is a lovely sentiment.

01:20:18.443 --> 01:20:19.569
Go, go, go, go!

01:20:20.378 --> 01:20:21.345
Hey!

01:20:21.746 --> 01:20:23.737
Kit! What are you...

01:20:24.983 --> 01:20:26.416
Oh, hi, fellas.

01:20:27.619 --> 01:20:28.779
-Look in the closet.
-Hey, just look

01:20:28.887 --> 01:20:29.945
-Yeah.
-...right in the closet.

01:20:30.054 --> 01:20:31.078
Why?

01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:32.349
-Huh?
-Go, go, go, go, go!

01:20:32.457 --> 01:20:34.652
Wait! What are you guys doing?

01:20:57.347 --> 01:21:00.248
Sorry. I tried to do it fast
so it wouldn't hurt.

01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:02.250
You were concerned about hurting me?

01:21:03.053 --> 01:21:04.611
That's a refreshing change of pace.

01:21:04.788 --> 01:21:07.313
Listen, I say there's no downside.
They already hate each other.

01:21:07.424 --> 01:21:08.413
I wonder how they're doing.

01:21:08.525 --> 01:21:09.822
Whoa, whoa, hold on just a second.

01:21:09.927 --> 01:21:11.758
Let's check, shall we?

01:21:14.665 --> 01:21:16.462
Okay, watch this.

01:21:20.003 --> 01:21:24.167
Is this how it's gonna be?
'Cause your note says,

01:21:24.274 --> 01:21:26.333
"Hi, we need to talk."

01:21:26.443 --> 01:21:27.933
Yeah, I wrote that.

01:21:28.111 --> 01:21:32.138
Right after I tied myself to the chair
and covered my mouth with duct tape.

01:21:32.249 --> 01:21:34.513
-So you don't want to talk.
-To you?

01:21:36.186 --> 01:21:37.483
I'll pass.

01:21:40.858 --> 01:21:42.985
I can't see her face.
Do you have any other angles?

01:21:43.093 --> 01:21:44.685
Of course I have angles. Check it out.

01:21:45.495 --> 01:21:49.932
I installed 27 cameras that cover
every inch of the apartment.

01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:52.535
-Were these up last night?
-Yeah.

01:21:53.003 --> 01:21:53.970
No.

01:21:55.372 --> 01:21:56.737
I helped tie the knots.

01:21:56.840 --> 01:21:58.671
The one on his feet
is called an Anchor Hitch.

01:21:58.775 --> 01:22:00.242
I could get out of those ropes.

01:22:00.344 --> 01:22:01.811
You can't get out
of your barbecue apron.

01:22:04.648 --> 01:22:07.242
This is ridiculous,
not to mention juvenile.

01:22:07.351 --> 01:22:10.218
We can't just sit here
and not say anything.

01:22:12.623 --> 01:22:14.715
All right, fine. I'll start.

01:22:15.925 --> 01:22:18.018
I think you're being a jackass.

01:22:21.364 --> 01:22:25.300
I think those pants make you look fat,
but in a sexy...

01:22:26.836 --> 01:22:28.963
-I don't get it.
-I told you this was a stupid idea.

01:22:29.538 --> 01:22:30.505
Hey.

01:22:31.674 --> 01:22:32.936
We should have done the flowers.

01:22:33.042 --> 01:22:36.068
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
She's going to say something.

01:22:38.014 --> 01:22:39.572
Tripp, I apologize.

01:22:40.383 --> 01:22:43.841
My job was manipulative and deceitful.

01:22:43.953 --> 01:22:47.912
But the second that I found out
about Amy, I was gonna end it.

01:22:48.925 --> 01:22:51.917
But I never got the chance,
because you found out first.

01:23:02.038 --> 01:23:02.772
Sorry. Sorry.

01:23:02.772 --> 01:23:04.740
Sorry. Sorry.

01:23:10.179 --> 01:23:11.578
Apology accepted.

01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:13.073
Thank you.

01:23:14.817 --> 01:23:17.718
Come on.
You don't want to say anything?

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.414
-You know, I do have a question.
-Absolutely. Anything.

01:23:21.324 --> 01:23:23.815
How many others were there?
Before me.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.924
I'm just asking, 'cause, you know,
maybe we could all get together.

01:23:27.029 --> 01:23:28.519
You know, form a support group.

01:23:28.631 --> 01:23:30.963
And if there already is a group,
I'm curious,

01:23:31.067 --> 01:23:33.160
is it a small group,
like a basketball team?

01:23:33.269 --> 01:23:34.861
Or is it a big group,

01:23:35.871 --> 01:23:37.099
like the Chinese?

01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:39.298
Wow. Somebody's a little cranky today.

01:23:39.408 --> 01:23:43.208
Tripp, your mother was still making you
pancakes for breakfast.

01:23:43.312 --> 01:23:46.007
And it's not as if
I waltzed into your life unbidden.

01:23:46.114 --> 01:23:47.979
Your parents called me.

01:23:48.249 --> 01:23:51.218
Your life was in
an extended stall pattern.

01:23:51.319 --> 01:23:52.911
I wish I could talk to guys like that.

01:23:53.021 --> 01:23:55.012
Well, it's easier when the guy is tied up.

01:23:55.123 --> 01:23:58.354
No, I've talked to guys tied up before.

01:24:00.962 --> 01:24:02.987
You want to talk about my life?
What about your life?

01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:04.462
Hey, but maybe I shouldn't judge.

01:24:04.566 --> 01:24:07.433
I'm sure there's some reason
that you turned out to be a soul-sucking,

01:24:07.535 --> 01:24:09.730
Labrador-retriever-killing harpy.

01:24:09.838 --> 01:24:11.931
I don't get it.
How does the dog fit into it?

01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.439
-Good question.
-Can you turn it up?

01:24:13.775 --> 01:24:16.744
Well, they're laptop speakers, so...

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:20.408
Unless...

01:24:22.117 --> 01:24:23.914
I was doing fine before you showed up.

01:24:24.519 --> 01:24:25.747
All right? I was having fun.

01:24:25.854 --> 01:24:27.481
Oh, and I just ruined everything!

01:24:27.956 --> 01:24:30.049
So is that why you tried
to break up with me?

01:24:30.158 --> 01:24:32.854
Or actually, you didn't.
You just trotted out your parents

01:24:32.961 --> 01:24:35.259
so that I would have
to break up with you.

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:37.991
-Oh, snap!
-That got his attention!

01:24:38.099 --> 01:24:41.432
That's right, you call her on her shit,
she's gonna call you on yours!

01:24:41.536 --> 01:24:44.699
What are you going to do, baby?
Are you gonna cry?

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:46.664
Sorry.

01:24:47.542 --> 01:24:49.533
Why would you do that?

01:24:51.346 --> 01:24:52.540
Because

01:24:53.748 --> 01:24:55.238
you gave me "the look."

01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:57.375
-Not "the look."
-Why are you bringing up "the look"?

01:24:57.485 --> 01:24:58.474
What's "the look"?

01:24:58.787 --> 01:25:03.349
The look that says, "Hey, I like you."

01:25:03.858 --> 01:25:05.189
Oh, wow.

01:25:07.128 --> 01:25:09.358
That must've been horrible for you.

01:25:09.631 --> 01:25:10.723
Do I do "the look"?

01:25:10.832 --> 01:25:11.821
Well, yeah.

01:25:12.033 --> 01:25:13.000
Well, no.

01:25:13.668 --> 01:25:15.362
I never meant to hurt you.

01:25:19.106 --> 01:25:22.405
I believe that.
But what do I know about you?

01:25:22.676 --> 01:25:27.079
I mean, the entire amount of time
we spent together was just a big scam.

01:25:28.348 --> 01:25:33.047
I found a woman I cared about,
and she turned out to be a total fraud.

01:25:36.457 --> 01:25:38.254
Do you have real feelings?

01:25:38.959 --> 01:25:41.086
Of course I have real feelings.

01:25:41.195 --> 01:25:43.629
-For what?
-For you!

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:46.456
And believe me, I did not want that,

01:25:46.567 --> 01:25:49.263
because I had a good life before you.

01:25:49.903 --> 01:25:52.963
Well, not good, but it was okay.

01:25:54.274 --> 01:25:56.572
Well, it was empty, actually,

01:25:56.677 --> 01:26:00.545
but at least I was blissfully unaware
of how miserable I was!

01:26:00.647 --> 01:26:03.445
Whereas now, because of you,

01:26:03.951 --> 01:26:06.078
I am acutely aware

01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:09.451
of how completely
and totally unhappy I am!

01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:14.191
Thank you for that.

01:26:22.536 --> 01:26:26.131
I don't usually like reality TV shows,
but this is so emotional.

01:26:26.773 --> 01:26:28.400
Are you crying?

01:26:30.644 --> 01:26:31.633
Come on, Tripp.

01:26:51.731 --> 01:26:52.789
He's moving.

01:26:52.899 --> 01:26:54.491
He's rolling. Here we go.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.124
He's making a move! All right!

01:26:56.235 --> 01:26:57.998
He's moving his feet! He's rolling!

01:26:58.104 --> 01:26:59.628
-Go! Go!
-Go!

01:26:59.739 --> 01:27:01.331
Oh, my God! He could

01:27:01.474 --> 01:27:02.998
-go all the way!
-Go all the way!

01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:06.601
Don't do all the work, Son!
Make her meet you half way!

01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:15.177
So what do we do now?

01:27:20.660 --> 01:27:22.958
Actually, it's quite simple.

01:27:23.062 --> 01:27:25.553
You just have to decide.

01:27:26.299 --> 01:27:28.893
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life having fun?

01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.026
Or do you want to spend it with me?

01:27:32.171 --> 01:27:35.231
Shut up.
Not everything you say is perfect.

01:27:35.341 --> 01:27:38.139
We can have a little bit of fun, can't we?

01:27:47.253 --> 01:27:48.220
Right on, man!

01:27:49.088 --> 01:27:50.055
All right!

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.024
Yeah!

01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:01.791
Hallelujah!

01:28:05.471 --> 01:28:07.268
Show's over. You don't need to see that.

01:28:07.373 --> 01:28:09.500
Come on, let's you and I
go outside, huh?

01:28:09.609 --> 01:28:11.668
Play some football.
I'll show you how to throw it deep.

01:28:11.777 --> 01:28:14.109
After, I'll show you
how to ice your shoulder down.

01:28:24.956 --> 01:28:26.287
Give you a hand?

01:28:26.391 --> 01:28:29.326
You just take it easy.
I got everything under control.

01:28:29.461 --> 01:28:31.793
Hey, what's the champagne about?

01:28:31.930 --> 01:28:33.192
It's Thursday.

01:28:38.536 --> 01:28:39.594
Thank you.

01:28:41.273 --> 01:28:42.467
You're welcome.

01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:44.030
Cheers.

01:28:50.282 --> 01:28:53.251
All right, Captain,
where are we heading?

01:28:56.821 --> 01:28:58.686
There's a lighthouse!
Can we go over there?

01:28:59.157 --> 01:29:01.091
Sure. You're driving.

01:29:07.899 --> 01:29:10.197
Tripp! Jibe ho! God, I said it late!

01:29:10.302 --> 01:29:11.428
I'm sorry!

01:29:16.708 --> 01:29:18.699
-Tripp!
-What happened to "jibe ho"?

01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:20.607
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

01:29:20.712 --> 01:29:23.545
Yeah. Just got the wind
knocked out of me.

01:29:23.648 --> 01:29:25.582
Maybe a collapsed lung,
a bruised sternum.

01:29:25.684 --> 01:29:27.515
Other than that, I'll survive.

01:29:27.619 --> 01:29:30.315
I'm going to get you
a flotation device, okay?

01:29:30.422 --> 01:29:31.389
Yeah.

01:29:32.624 --> 01:29:33.852
Stay right there.

01:29:34.225 --> 01:29:35.920
That's a good idea.

01:29:38.263 --> 01:29:39.423
Oh, shit.

01:29:41.099 --> 01:29:42.430
Oh, shit!

01:29:42.734 --> 01:29:46.295
No biting! No biting. No bite, no bite.
No, no, no, no...

01:29:54.244 --> 01:29:55.211
Good boy.

01:29:55.713 --> 01:29:56.771
Come here, you.

01:29:57.281 --> 01:29:59.272
Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:59.883 --> 01:30:01.441
That's it. Okay.

01:30:01.552 --> 01:30:03.179
Here! I...

01:30:04.054 --> 01:30:05.681
Oh, my God!

01:30:05.789 --> 01:30:06.756
Yeah.

01:30:07.591 --> 01:30:09.081
That's amazing.

01:30:11.228 --> 01:30:13.526
What do you say, big man, huh?

01:30:21.905 --> 01:30:25.306
Hey, still need this?

01:30:28.379 --> 01:30:29.812
No, I'm good.

01:30:32.916 --> 01:30:34.008
I'm real good.

01:30:34.852 --> 01:30:35.819
Okay.

01:30:59.009 --> 01:31:01.000
Honey, it's an Eastern Wood-Pewee.

01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:02.100
Eastern Wood-Pewee?

01:31:02.212 --> 01:31:04.339
You couldn't be more wrong
if you called it a Canadian goose.

01:31:08.519 --> 01:31:10.316
I'll give you a Canadian goose.

01:31:25.134 --> 01:31:26.192
Look!

01:31:30.306 --> 01:31:31.796
He's so tame.

01:31:31.908 --> 01:31:34.809
Yeah. See, once we accept the fact
that we're not separate from nature,

01:31:34.911 --> 01:31:36.572
she welcomes us. And it's not with fear.

01:31:36.679 --> 01:31:38.374
Right? Who do you love?

01:31:43.152 --> 01:31:44.744
<i>Hit the road, Tripp</i>

01:31:44.854 --> 01:31:46.287
<i>-And don't you come back
-And don't you come back</i>

01:31:46.389 --> 01:31:49.552
<i>-...no more, no more, no more, no more
-...no more, no more, no more, no more</i>

01:31:49.659 --> 01:31:51.217
<i>-Hit the road, Tripp
-Hit the road, Tripp</i>

01:31:51.327 --> 01:31:54.490
<i>-And don't you come back no more
-And don't you come back no more</i>

01:31:54.597 --> 01:31:55.791
<i>What'd I say?</i>
