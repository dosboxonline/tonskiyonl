then immediately left,
never to be seen again,

38:46.365 --> 38:48.366
and then a fire broke out.

38:48.367 --> 38:51.037
You don't think
that's suspicious?

38:52.204 --> 38:54.247
Maybe.

38:54.248 --> 38:55.999
Maybe it was just a coincidence.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.917
Why didn't you try
to stop him from leaving?

38:57.918 --> 39:00.003
- Objection.
- You're the witness.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.046
And the judge.

39:01.047 --> 39:03.549
Sustained.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.388
When the cabin burned,

39:10.389 --> 39:12.558
did you think
Coach Scott did it?

39:15.061 --> 39:17.062
I thought anything
could have caused it.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.605
Um...

39:18.606 --> 39:20.690
a spark from the fireplace,

39:20.691 --> 39:22.567
- a candle falling over--
- [Taissa] But not Coach Scott?

39:22.568 --> 39:25.111
You never wanted to ask him?

39:25.112 --> 39:26.488
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

39:26.489 --> 39:27.781
Because he wasn't around to ask.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.282
But you knew where he was!

39:29.283 --> 39:30.992
- [Gen] What?
- [Taissa] You've known

39:30.993 --> 39:33.703
this whole time.
Misty figured that out.

39:33.704 --> 39:34.662
- Objection.
- [Taissa] You didn't just

39:34.663 --> 39:35.955
see him before the fire.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.207
He saw you, right?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.875
You spoke to him.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.252
That's how you knew
he was leaving.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.671
You knew where he was going

39:43.672 --> 39:45.799
but you gave orders
not to search for him anyway.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.593
You've been lying to us
to protect him,

39:48.594 --> 39:50.512
and this trial was just
another desperate attempt

39:50.513 --> 39:52.180
for you to let him off the hook.
You can stop me

39:52.181 --> 39:53.306
- anytime I'm wrong.
- Okay.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.893
I knew he was out there.

39:58.187 --> 40:00.231
But he didn't want
anything to do with us.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.734
I knew that we could just
let him live in peace

40:04.735 --> 40:06.694
because he wasn't
any kind of threat.

40:06.695 --> 40:08.988
He wasn't a threat?

40:08.989 --> 40:10.615
How was that for you to decide?

40:10.616 --> 40:12.700
You let him go
and we almost died.

to be the equipment manager
