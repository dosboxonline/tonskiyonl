14:50.758 --> 14:52.965
That is correct.

14:54.172 --> 14:56.068
The airport and
the surrounding developments

14:56.172 --> 14:58.827
are a
public-private partnership.

14:58.965 --> 15:00.896
Why doesn't the state
take control of the land

15:01.000 --> 15:02.482
through eminent domain?

15:02.586 --> 15:04.551
Then we control the lease.

15:06.241 --> 15:09.000
Are you willing to have
the state pay fair market value?

15:09.103 --> 15:10.172
Wait a minute.

15:11.068 --> 15:13.620
You stood before me and
fought against eminent domain.

15:13.758 --> 15:15.655
Well, that was for
a proposed condominium project

15:15.758 --> 15:19.034
with no measurable benefit
to the state or the community.

15:19.137 --> 15:21.068
In five years, this development

15:21.172 --> 15:23.344
will be the largest employer
in Montana.

15:23.448 --> 15:24.724
That is benefit.

15:24.862 --> 15:26.999
I don't think
that eminent domain

15:27.000 --> 15:28.931
is relevant in this instance.

15:29.068 --> 15:32.068
The Yellowstone entered
into an agreement with M.E.,

15:32.206 --> 15:34.067
making a decision

15:34.068 --> 15:36.723
that it financially benefits
the state to purchase the land.

15:36.724 --> 15:39.378
To control the lease is, uh...
[chuckles]

15:39.379 --> 15:42.413
...aside from being
a likely violation

15:42.517 --> 15:43.758
of the Fourth Amendment,

15:43.862 --> 15:46.413
it's a blatant abuse
of state authority.

15:48.689 --> 15:52.413
I mean, the only way to save
a portion of the ranch

15:52.551 --> 15:54.068
is to sacrifice a portion.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.758
Unless the state

15:55.862 --> 15:59.551
wants to designate it
a Montana historical monument

15:59.655 --> 16:01.379
and pay the $1.5 billion dollar

16:01.482 --> 16:04.137
tax burden
on the estate's behalf.

16:04.241 --> 16:05.793
Then find a realtor
and list the property

16:05.896 --> 16:07.412
or schedule an auction.

16:07.413 --> 16:09.793
And if the state decides
to purchase the land,

16:09.896 --> 16:11.655
the state can make an offer.

16:11.758 --> 16:13.724
Eminent domain is gonna
take years to prove,

16:13.827 --> 16:15.482
and that conservation easement,

16:15.586 --> 16:17.586
it's a much bigger problem
than you think.

16:17.689 --> 16:19.172
Their legal fund

16:19.310 --> 16:20.586
is a federal grant,

16:20.689 --> 16:22.965
which is to say,
they can afford the fight.

16:25.965 --> 16:28.551
Let me give you some advice.

16:28.655 --> 16:29.862
Both of you.

16:29.965 --> 16:32.413
Disagree with
John Dutton's policies

16:32.517 --> 16:35.137
all you want, and, yes,
they were self-serving.

16:35.241 --> 16:36.895
All he cared about
was preserving

16:36.896 --> 16:38.723
the boundaries around his ranch.

16:38.724 --> 16:40.655
But, in the process,

16:40.758 --> 16:42.689
he protected this region
from being dependent

16:42.793 --> 16:45.344
on tourism and real estate
for its tax revenue.

16:45.448 --> 16:47.724
Take a good look at Jackson Hole

16:47.827 --> 16:49.344
and its lack of
affordable housing.

16:49.482 --> 16:50.344
Look at the traffic,

16:50.482 --> 16:51.413

16:51.517 --> 16:52.655

16:52.758 --> 16:55.103
because that
is what you're inviting.

17:03.965 --> 17:07.792
I have an obligation
to preserve the ranch,

17:07.793 --> 17:09.965
or at least
as much of it as I can.

17:10.068 --> 17:12.310
If the state wants
to purchase the land,

17:12.413 --> 17:14.206
that would certainly
expedite the process

17:14.344 --> 17:15.862

was leased for the project?

17:18.379 --> 17:20.206
50,000 acres.

What's land an acre

17:22.206 --> 17:25.309
