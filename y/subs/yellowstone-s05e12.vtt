Start the car and drive

43:59.482 --> 44:00.931
or you can clean up the mess.

44:08.413 --> 44:09.861
Where am I going?

44:09.862 --> 44:12.551
Just drive straight and
drive the fucking speed limit.

44:15.793 --> 44:17.068
You should be scared.

44:17.206 --> 44:19.000
You know what
your daddy does for a living?

44:21.586 --> 44:23.448
Do you know who I am?

44:23.551 --> 44:25.448
I do not.

44:25.551 --> 44:27.550
Get so cocky in the private
sector you forgot

44:27.551 --> 44:30.896
to build out immediate family
on a target, Grant?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.343
It's not the way
you were trained.

44:32.344 --> 44:33.793
Listen, man, what we do,
it is strictly--

44:33.931 --> 44:35.965
I want you to listen.
I don't want you to talk.

44:36.068 --> 44:37.241
I am what you are.

44:37.379 --> 44:38.688
You understand
what I mean by that?

44:38.689 --> 44:40.068
Yeah, I understand
what you mean.

44:40.206 --> 44:41.654
You got separation.
You can't be connected.

44:41.655 --> 44:43.241
Great, you saved me the trouble.

44:43.344 --> 44:44.688
But if you try
to hedge your bets

44:44.689 --> 44:46.550
by getting distance
with my family,

44:46.551 --> 44:49.103
I will paint yours
on the fucking wall.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.171
I should kill you
in front of her

44:51.172 --> 44:53.033
for what you did to my father,

44:53.034 --> 44:55.620
but I'm gonna trade
my family for yours.

44:57.724 --> 44:59.654
You think you can't be touched?

44:59.655 --> 45:01.344
Look how easy this was for me.

45:01.482 --> 45:02.862
I have 12 years in the teams.

45:02.965 --> 45:04.585
Think about
how many friends I have.

45:04.586 --> 45:06.586
You don't want this fight.
You can't win it.

45:06.689 --> 45:07.965
We got enough separation.

45:08.068 --> 45:09.758
- We don't need anything else.
- Pull over.

45:15.517 --> 45:16.895
I have your DoD file.

45:16.896 --> 45:18.931
I know your address.

45:19.034 --> 45:20.517
I know where your parents live,

45:20.655 --> 45:23.344
I know where your wife works,
I know everything.

45:24.448 --> 45:27.103
You touched me, but I can
touch you whenever I want.

45:29.137 --> 45:31.619
It's bottled up.
You and me, we're good.

45:31.620 --> 45:33.689
We're so far from fucking good
you couldn't see it

45:33.827 --> 45:36.689
standing on your roof
at 2713 West Elm.

45:37.862 --> 45:39.137
If I were you, I'd move.

45:39.275 --> 45:40.551
'Cause I might
wake up tomorrow and decide

45:40.655 --> 45:43.137
we don't have a deal.
You got me?

45:43.827 --> 45:44.620
No!

45:44.724 --> 45:46.585
Stop, please.

45:46.586 --> 45:48.930
Where I come from,
we call that counting coup.

45:48.931 --> 45:50.413
That means
I took a piece of your soul

45:50.517 --> 45:52.137
and I'm gonna keep it.

45:52.241 --> 45:55.000
And, yeah, you should cry.

45:55.137 --> 45:57.655
Have fun explaining this
to your wife.

45:57.758 --> 45:59.758
When I get out, you take off.

45:59.862 --> 46:02.758
You look back, I kill you both.

I think he understands.

46:29.482 --> 46:31.481
Did you count coup?

46:31.482 --> 46:33.586
I counted coup.
