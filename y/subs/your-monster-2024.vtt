Okay.

Oh, my God.

back at your mom's?

03:42.189 --> 03:44.191
Not that
she's ever here anymore.

03:52.700 --> 03:54.502
Your mom sent you
12 pies, 100 cookies

03:54.502 --> 03:56.604
and $5,000?

03:56.604 --> 03:58.205
She loves to send
sugar and dough

03:58.205 --> 03:59.607
when she's on a diet.

03:59.607 --> 04:02.276
What does she think?
Carbs cure cancer?

04:05.245 --> 04:06.146
What is that?

04:06.146 --> 04:07.681
What's what?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.550
There's a box
and a bag over there.

04:11.319 --> 04:13.587
- What?
-  Ah!

04:15.055 --> 04:16.023
What is it?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.227
Jacob called me
and asked me to pick up

04:20.227 --> 04:21.562
some of your stuff.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.500
Oh, okay.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.835
I know... I know it sucks.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.069
Okay, I know it sucks.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.904
But, you're home now,

04:30.904 --> 04:32.573
and the surgery went well

04:33.707 --> 04:35.443
and you got $5,000.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.812
Let's take a beat here, okay?

04:38.812 --> 04:42.215

04:46.320 --> 04:48.522
I'm fucking here
with you, okay?

04:48.522 --> 04:50.057
- Okay, thank you.
- It's gonna be okay.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.325

04:57.931 --> 04:59.367

04:59.367 --> 05:01.502
I'm doing this
really stupid reading,

05:01.502 --> 05:02.570

to fuck me,

05:02.570 --> 05:04.204

- Wait, now?

05:04.204 --> 05:07.040

for <i>House of Good Women...</i>

08:33.714 --> 08:34.648
...for a little bit.

Taylor Gregory, would not

08:41.421 --> 08:44.758
stop talking about going in
for Jacob last week.

08:44.758 --> 08:45.893
I almost taped her mouth shut.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.060
- Wait. What do you mean?
- It's like...

08:47.060 --> 08:48.829

08:55.836 --> 08:57.504

08:57.504 --> 08:59.607

08:59.607 --> 09:01.875
- No.
- Why are you practicing then?

09:05.478 --> 09:08.782
Because I like to keep
my vocal cords warm.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.685
- Aw, shit, Laura.
- Wait. Did you get one?

09:11.685 --> 09:13.520
Yeah, but Ellyn Michaelson
is casting it,

09:13.520 --> 09:14.922
and I don't fuck with her.

09:14.922 --> 09:15.923
Oh, my God, I can't.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.127
I mean, I... I thought that

09:20.127 --> 09:23.330
at the very least
he'd still...

09:23.330 --> 09:25.866
Do... Do you think Jacob
still wants me in the show?

09:27.735 --> 09:29.502
I mean...

09:29.502 --> 09:30.971
You did just have surgery
a few weeks ago.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.706
Maybe...

09:32.706 --> 09:34.541
Maybe he thinks
you can't perform right now.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.543
And...

09:36.543 --> 09:38.278
Maybe you can't.
I mean...

09:39.680 --> 09:41.548
You still kind of
have cancer, right?

09:44.551 --> 09:46.119

09:46.119 --> 09:47.487
We're here.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.422

09:51.158 --> 09:52.359
- You're not coming with me?
- Mmm-mmm.

09:52.359 --> 09:54.161
I can't. I gotta go to karate.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.495
I love you so much.

09:55.495 --> 09:56.897
- I love you.
- Call me after.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.472
Aren't you used
to this by now?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.875
No, no. No!

11:47.440 --> 11:48.641

12:57.577 --> 13:00.447

13:51.932 --> 13:54.567
Hey, stranger.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.137
Wasn't sure
what kind of tea you drank.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.805
Hope green's all right.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.154
You done?
Ah!

14:14.154 --> 14:15.989
Great. Honestly...

14:15.989 --> 14:17.724
It's too bad you conked out.

14:17.724 --> 14:20.793
I have this pretty neat
monster routine I do now.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.995
I think you'd find it to be,

14:21.995 --> 14:24.464
um, (CLICKS TONGUE) very,

14:24.464 --> 14:25.899
well, scary.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.634
You don't remember me?

14:28.168 --> 14:28.868
At all?

14:30.170 --> 14:32.906
1994? Tropical Storm Beryl?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.475
Your mom was out late.
Shocker.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.344
You freaked out
and saw me under the bed.

14:37.344 --> 14:40.247
- No?
- What? What is happening?

14:40.247 --> 14:41.314
Okay? A little offensive.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.749
What about '01?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.151
You got in trouble?
Opened the closet.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.418
We bumped into each other.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.853
Right? My beard was
a little patchier

14:46.853 --> 14:48.155
in my tween years.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.024
Nothing?

14:52.792 --> 14:53.994
Okay. Oh!

14:53.994 --> 14:55.828
That, uh,
that musical theater kid.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.829
What was his name again?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.601
Benji?-Benji!

15:01.601 --> 15:03.503
Should've eaten
that little motherfucker.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.473
You're a real temptress,

15:06.473 --> 15:07.540
you know that?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.381
But I was young.

15:14.381 --> 15:15.648
Can't be too hard on myself.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.850
This can't be real.
This isn't real.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.887
Are you gonna hurt me?

15:20.887 --> 15:23.023
I don't know.
Do you want me to hurt you?

15:23.023 --> 15:24.024
No.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.130
Then, what do you want?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.898
So.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.233
I'm not really
a roommates guy.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.702
Uh, after you moved out,

15:35.702 --> 15:37.404
and your mom started
travelling,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.072
doing all that spa shit.

15:39.072 --> 15:43.410
I kinda, actually, realized
I prefer living alone.

15:43.410 --> 15:46.179
But then, tonight,
you saw me, I saw you,

15:46.179 --> 15:47.514
and then you were
on the floor,

15:47.514 --> 15:49.716
and I can't just leave you
lying there like that.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.251
I mean, I'm a monster,
but I'm not...

15:52.119 --> 15:53.987
a monster, you know.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.855
Anyway, I thought
about our situation,

15:55.855 --> 15:57.424
and here's what I think
we should do.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.492
Do you mind?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.528
I think we both
take the night.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.496
Rest, regroup.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.898
Then tomorrow, you get up,
you have your coffee,

16:05.898 --> 16:08.001
you, uh, you pack
your shit up,

16:08.001 --> 16:09.469
and get out!

16:12.972 --> 16:16.409
But I... I can't leave,
this is my house.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.411
Well, it's my house now.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.413
But I have nowhere else to go.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.082
I wasn't asking.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.963
- All right.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.067
It's just that
I'm talking to a monster.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.135
And... And...
And you're scary.

16:42.135 --> 16:44.437
You're really freaking me out
right now.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.573
- No, stop! Please stop.
- And I'm sad.

16:46.573 --> 16:49.609
I'm really, really sad.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.311
I just need you out
of the fucking house.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.080
-I'm so sad!
- I need you out of the house.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.314
It's a... Fine!

16:54.314 --> 16:55.682
Fine!

16:59.286 --> 17:02.389
Okay, two weeks.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.124
You got two weeks.

17:05.425 --> 17:06.759
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.395
After that, you're outta here.
You pack your bags,

17:08.395 --> 17:09.629
you hit the fucking pavement.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.664
And you know what else?
While you're here,

17:11.664 --> 17:13.733
you follow my rules. Okay?

17:13.733 --> 17:16.136
Number one,
don't get in my way.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.106
Number two,
don't tell me what to do.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.575
And number three,
if you tell anyone about me,

17:22.575 --> 17:25.245
I'll rip your
fucking throat out.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.674
Yeah, you better run.

17:56.609 --> 17:59.078
Still got it. Still got it!

19:30.437 --> 19:32.071
Can I help you?

19:32.071 --> 19:34.574
No, I'm just
looking for something to read.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.975
Is that a problem with you?

19:36.276 --> 19:39.212
No, it's not a problem

19:43.583 --> 19:44.717
Little books.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.019

so I tore them up.</i>

19:48.521 --> 19:50.357
It's cute.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.824
<i>A lady doesn't
correspond...</i>

19:51.824 --> 19:52.625
Sesame chicken?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.628
- Yeah.
- Shun Lee?

19:56.829 --> 19:59.165
- Yeah.
- Cool. It's a good spot.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.303
Oh, look, little dog.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.937
Lots of little things.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.138
- Are you hungry?
-No.

20:06.138 --> 20:07.374
<i>Well, you're right.</i>

20:08.040 --> 20:09.276
I already ate.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.943
So you don't want
any sesame chicken?

20:10.943 --> 20:13.112
If I wanted sesame chicken,
I'd eat some sesame chicken.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.414
That's odd,
'cause you keep looking

20:14.414 --> 20:15.615
at the sesame chicken.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.650
I don't keep looking
at the sesame chicken.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.185
You keep looking
at the sesame chicken.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.291
- Let me just make you a plate.
- I don't want a plate.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.992
- I ordered too much, anyway.
- Sure, give me the extra food.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.360
- Let me just make you a plate.
- Dying to feed me...

20:27.360 --> 20:28.761
- Take some chicken, and...
- ...your sesame chicken.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.396
- let's stop talking about it.
- Just give it to me.

20:29.396 --> 20:31.864
Just hand it to me! Mmm.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.032
Mmm.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.934
<i>From the very first
moment I saw you...</i>

20:39.406 --> 20:40.373
Ha!

20:42.375 --> 20:43.676
Can you order some more?

20:46.679 --> 20:47.680
Mmm.

20:49.482 --> 20:52.719
The ratio of pork to dough

20:52.719 --> 20:54.153
is a little off.

20:54.153 --> 20:56.556
But I like the taste, generally.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.391
- You're dripping on yourself.
-Oh.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.528
Look at that. Oops!

21:02.695 --> 21:04.364
Oh, what? Wait.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.701
This supposed
to be a documentary?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.537
Well, clearly not.
He's doing it all wrong.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.339
Strike down, not across.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.907
You're flailing, man.

21:14.907 --> 21:17.243
Hey, I was watching that.

21:17.243 --> 21:20.747
Oh, my God!
Best movie ever made.

21:20.747 --> 21:24.216
The music it...
always makes me wanna cry.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.153
- No.
- Give it to me.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.220
- Give me that.
- No!

21:28.220 --> 21:29.722
Give me the remote.

21:35.528 --> 21:37.764
Fine, I'm going to bed.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.031
Oh, come on.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.400
Just gonna
give up that easily.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.068
-Mmm-hmm.
- Fine!

21:52.479 --> 21:53.746
<i>They didn't have to go
to all this trouble.</i>

21:53.746 --> 21:55.214
<i>A small wedding would
have been all right.</i>

21:58.618 --> 22:01.688
They really don't make
movies like this anymore.

22:01.688 --> 22:04.557
Every time.

22:04.557 --> 22:06.258
Every time, it makes me cry.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.271
Yeah, I liked it.

22:21.307 --> 22:24.411
- Are you crying?
- No. I'm not crying.

22:24.411 --> 22:25.878
- You're crying.
- I know I'm crying.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.380
I mean, I'm obviously
not crying.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.616
Are you fucking blind?

22:29.616 --> 22:32.719
My eyes are dry
and you're crying.

22:32.719 --> 22:35.788
The movie was
just fine, okay?

22:35.788 --> 22:38.925
You love musicals.

22:38.925 --> 22:40.627
- No, I don't. Stop.
-  Yes, you do.

22:40.627 --> 22:43.430
This is some bullshit!

22:43.430 --> 22:45.465
I don't wanna
feel this way.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.615
Shit.

23:02.615 --> 23:03.683
Hello.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.418
Don't sneak up
on me like that.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.486
Come on, you're fine.

23:08.187 --> 23:08.888
You going somewhere?

23:09.989 --> 23:11.624
No.

23:11.624 --> 23:13.660
Hmm.

23:14.561 --> 23:15.662
What are you reading?

23:17.964 --> 23:19.599
A script.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.469
Cool, who... who wrote it?

23:22.469 --> 23:25.271
This guy... friend... I know.

23:26.673 --> 23:30.209
Oh, a guy named
Jacob Sullivan.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.611
Very interesting.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.882
Actually, yes,
it is interesting

23:35.882 --> 23:39.819
because I am contemplating,

23:39.819 --> 23:44.223
maybe, showing up
to the auditions today.

23:44.223 --> 23:46.358
-Oh!
- Maybe.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.394
Is this the show
you were telling me about?

23:48.394 --> 23:49.862
The one you developed
with him?

23:49.862 --> 23:51.230
Yes. No!

23:51.230 --> 23:52.999
I did not develop it with him.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.068
I was just very helpful
in the development process.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.805
Yeah, those two sentences mean
the exact same thing.

23:58.805 --> 24:01.641
It'd probably be weird
for me to just show up, right?

24:01.641 --> 24:03.876
I mean, what would
I say to him?

24:03.876 --> 24:06.646
Like, "Oh, give me the role
because you feel bad for me?"

24:07.780 --> 24:08.915
You could.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.817
Or I could threaten to eat him
if that would help.

24:10.817 --> 24:12.251
I mean, I could eat him.
It would literally take me,

24:12.251 --> 24:13.352
like, two seconds.

24:13.352 --> 24:14.587
He broke up with me.

24:14.587 --> 24:15.688
I mean, why would he...
why would he want me

24:15.688 --> 24:17.490
in the show
if he broke up with me.

24:17.490 --> 24:19.492
Uh, because you're good.

24:19.492 --> 24:21.561
Because it's
your fucking part.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.863
I don't even have
an appointment.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.698
- They're not gonna let me in.
- Okay.

24:25.698 --> 24:26.833
And I can't do
a musical right now.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.334
Look at me.

24:28.334 --> 24:29.335
I just had surgery.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.204
So?-So?

24:32.204 --> 24:34.073
- Look at me!
- I'm looking at you.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.675
- Look!
- Uh, from this angle

24:35.675 --> 24:37.677
I can see your back
and your face simultaneously.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.411
That's how much
I'm looking at you.

24:39.411 --> 24:40.547
- I'm a mess!
- No, you're not.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.582
- I'm a disaster.
- Ugh!

24:44.383 --> 24:46.285
Okay. Don't go.

24:47.554 --> 24:50.089
Hi, I am here
for the audition.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.357
Yes, so is everyone.

24:51.991 --> 24:52.992
Right.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.762
Bye, diva. What part
are you reading for?

24:55.762 --> 24:57.864
- Uh, Laurie Francis.
-Okay.

24:57.864 --> 25:00.567
Uh, I actually don't
have an appointment.

25:02.702 --> 25:04.637
Um,
you cannot audition

25:04.637 --> 25:05.605
- without an appointment.
- I... I know.

25:05.605 --> 25:07.740
I... I just thought
maybe you could.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.741
I know,
I'm sorry you thought that,

25:08.741 --> 25:10.610
but I can't help you.
I'm so sorry.

25:11.944 --> 25:12.979
Okay.

25:14.581 --> 25:15.915
Okay, thank you.

25:15.915 --> 25:16.783
Wait.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.451
Why do you look
so familiar to me?

25:20.620 --> 25:23.389
Well, I...
I actually played Laurie

25:23.389 --> 25:25.091
in a few of the workshops

25:25.091 --> 25:27.426
- in the out-of-town tryouts.
- Oh, my God, right, yes.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.260
Yes. Oh, my God.
I remember now.

25:28.260 --> 25:30.630
You were so good.

25:30.630 --> 25:31.497
- Why didn't they...
- Thank you.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.065
...just offer it to you.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.767
Aren't you and Jacob,
like, dating?

25:34.767 --> 25:38.504
Oh, well, that...
It was, um...

25:38.504 --> 25:40.139
-Ooh!
- Actually, we're...

25:40.139 --> 25:42.341
- It's a little bit...
- You guys broke up. Got it.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.776
Say no more, okay.

25:43.776 --> 25:45.578
Um, here's what
we're gonna do.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.579
We're gonna squeeze you in.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.280
Don't tell anyone.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.116
Just, um, take a seat

25:50.116 --> 25:52.251
and we'll call your name
in a little bit, okay?

25:52.251 --> 25:53.485
Thank you so much.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.521
- That's so nice.
- This business is hell.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.758
Oh, my!

25:58.758 --> 26:00.126
That's Jackie Dennon.

26:00.126 --> 26:01.694
I love her.

26:03.696 --> 26:06.032
Oh, my God!
She's like...

26:06.032 --> 26:07.466
Oh, my God.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.201
Oh, my God.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.770
Jackie, hey.

26:10.770 --> 26:13.606
Oh, Scotty.
You can cross Sarah Mann

26:13.606 --> 26:15.541
and Ari Grace off the list.

26:18.845 --> 26:22.514
Oh, is that
a Ms. Jackie Dennon I see?

26:24.684 --> 26:26.786
Hi! Mmm.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.187
Oh, my goodness!
I keep forgetting

26:28.187 --> 26:30.056
- how gorgeous you are.
- Wait, look at you.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.557
- Oh, thank you.
- What are you doing?

26:31.557 --> 26:32.659
Can I have the number
of the doctor?

26:32.659 --> 26:34.126
Oh, stop!

26:34.126 --> 26:36.028
I'm so glad you're here.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.064
-Yeah, yeah.
- Scotty, who do I have next?

26:38.064 --> 26:40.532
Uh... Uh, you have,
uh, Laura Franco.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.369
Okay, Laura, follow me.

26:43.369 --> 26:44.303
This one won't take long.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.371
Okay, yeah. No rush.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.605
Bye.-Bye.

26:47.506 --> 26:48.908
Uh, come on, Lisa.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.576
Are you kidding me?

26:50.576 --> 26:51.678
I think about that
all the time.

26:51.678 --> 26:54.613
We have
Laura Franco stepping in.

27:00.086 --> 27:01.153
Oh, shit.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.724
- Hi.
-Laura.

27:05.557 --> 27:08.895
Wh... What are you doing here?

27:08.895 --> 27:10.797
Oh, I was... I was
in the neighborhood.

27:11.597 --> 27:13.666
I thought I'd pop in.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.334
What a surprise.

27:15.334 --> 27:19.271
I'm... happy... to see you.

27:19.271 --> 27:20.439
Uh, you two know each other?

27:20.439 --> 27:21.440
- Yeah.
-No.

27:21.908 --> 27:22.709
Yes.

27:22.709 --> 27:23.843
-Oh.
- I'm kidding.

27:23.843 --> 27:26.178
That's funny.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.379
Yes. Okay. Great.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.614
- Yeah.
-Um, okay.

27:28.614 --> 27:29.716
- Okay.
- Well, we have,

27:29.716 --> 27:31.583
uh, Jacob Sullivan,

27:31.583 --> 27:33.419
our celebrated director
and writer here,

27:33.419 --> 27:35.855
who you apparently
already know.

27:35.855 --> 27:37.924
And a few members
of our creative team.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.358
Okay?

27:39.358 --> 27:40.727
Nice to see you... Meet you.

27:40.727 --> 27:41.794
Yeah. Okay.
Whenever you're ready.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.195
-Okay.
- Thanks.

27:51.203 --> 27:53.205
Oh, that's, uh, that's it?
Just two bars?

27:53.205 --> 27:55.074
Okay. Got it. Sorry.

27:55.074 --> 27:55.975
Let's do it, yeah.

Maestro, from the top.

29:00.139 --> 29:01.607
I don't know what happened.

29:01.607 --> 29:04.043
I... I...
I completely blacked out.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.879
My voice closed up
and I was... I was doing

29:06.879 --> 29:09.048
this, like, weird thing
with my hand.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.350
And... And... Oh, my God!

29:11.350 --> 29:13.519
Ugh! I probably looked
like I had no idea

29:13.519 --> 29:15.721
- what I was doing.
-Oh, give me a break.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.123
- You know what you're doing.
- No.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.358
Clearly, I don't.
'Cause I just...

29:19.358 --> 29:21.227
I just messed it all up.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.762
I can't believe it. I failed.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.133
I failed. And now...

29:28.400 --> 29:29.568
And now my life is over.

29:30.702 --> 29:31.938
It's... It's done.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.641
But, whatever.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.812
'Cause I'm probably not
really that talented anyway.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.382
Hey, you know
who's super talented?

29:44.350 --> 29:45.617
Like a really good actor?

29:47.419 --> 29:48.520
Who?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.989
Me!

29:51.357 --> 29:53.192
You're not an actor.

29:53.192 --> 29:54.827
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

29:54.827 --> 29:57.063
Yeah, I'll prove it to ya.
I'll... I'll do a sonnet.

29:57.063 --> 29:58.497
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.099
I wanna. Uh, I wanna do
something more modern,

30:00.099 --> 30:03.202
like some, uh, Eugene O'Neill,
or Sam Shepard.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.171
- Uh, I'm not in the mood.
- You're not in the mood

30:05.171 --> 30:07.506
for one of the great
American playwrights? Okay.

30:09.375 --> 30:10.609
I can sing, too.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.511
- No, you can't.
- Yes, I can.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.180
- No, you can't.
- Five, six, seven...

30:20.452 --> 30:22.922
<i>**</i>

30:30.696 --> 30:32.498
<i>**</i>

30:33.799 --> 30:35.301
Good?

30:36.502 --> 30:37.503
Not terrible.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.308
Okay, here we go.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.742
How about <i>Comedy of Errors?</i>

30:43.742 --> 30:45.477
No, I don't do Shakespeare.

30:45.477 --> 30:47.813
What? Willy's the best.

30:48.747 --> 30:50.582
- Willy?
- That's what I call him.

30:50.582 --> 30:54.153
Look, I... I'm just
not that kind of actor.

30:54.153 --> 30:56.622
I mean, I love the plays.
I studied them,

30:56.622 --> 30:58.057
but I just... I'm...

30:58.057 --> 31:01.160
I'm not classically trained
or whatever.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.262
Well, you don't need
to be classically trained

31:03.262 --> 31:05.064
to do this.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.465
There's no subtext
in these plays.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.100
It's all just right there
on the page.

31:08.100 --> 31:09.668
- Mmm-hmm.
- You don't have to think.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.070
You just...

31:11.070 --> 31:12.638
feel your way
through the words.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.273
Really?

31:14.273 --> 31:16.142
Okay, Laurence Olivier.

31:16.142 --> 31:17.809
Show me how it's done.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.845
I will.
Thank you for the floor.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.114
Oh, I know
which one you should do.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.515
All right.
Whoo!

31:25.851 --> 31:26.852
Here.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.155
Okay, sure. Uh, give me some,

31:29.155 --> 31:30.957
uh, give me some
context for that.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.159
Okay, SparkNotes.

31:34.826 --> 31:35.761
Uh...

31:37.029 --> 31:41.600
This is basically this guy

31:41.600 --> 31:44.436
telling this girl
that he loves her,

31:44.436 --> 31:47.373
but it's confusing.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.375
There's too much stuff
in the way.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.478
That's correct. That was
a test and you passed.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.380
Okay.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.954
- Yeah, great.
- Well, don't you need

32:01.954 --> 32:04.290
- to look at it?
-"Sweet mistress,

32:04.290 --> 32:06.525
"what your name is else,
I know not,

"nor by what wonder

32:07.960 --> 32:09.461
-"you do hit of mine."
-  Why are you

32:09.461 --> 32:11.730
- talking like that?
- Why are you laughing at me?

32:11.730 --> 32:13.632
- I'm projecting.
- Okay.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.968
You don't need to do that.
It's just you and me,

32:15.968 --> 32:18.504
speak like a regular person.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.072
- Oh, you know what I mean.
-  Wow!

32:20.072 --> 32:21.373
You know what I mean.

32:21.373 --> 32:22.541
Okay, okay. Great, fine.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.476
Back to one.
All right. Ooh! I'm nervous.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.545
Okay.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.650
"Sweet mistress,

32:31.650 --> 32:34.153

"Nor by what wonder

create me new?

"be drowned if she sink!"

34:12.984 --> 34:13.919
That was good.

34:14.886 --> 34:15.854
Thanks.

34:20.959 --> 34:22.461
Ah.

34:26.365 --> 34:27.599
Shit, it's Jacob.

34:27.599 --> 34:28.667
Tell him to go fuck himself,
we're acting.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.169
What? No. I should.

34:30.169 --> 34:31.437
Well, tell him
he's a limp dick,

34:31.437 --> 34:32.971
- fuck face.
- Monster.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.640
- I should take this.
- Come on. No, no, no.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.275
Tell him his play
is problematic

34:36.275 --> 34:38.344
and riddled with clichés. Hey!

34:39.678 --> 34:41.480
Jacob? Hi!
<i>Hi.</i>

34:41.480 --> 34:43.782
- Hi! Oh, shit.
-<i>Busy?</i>

34:43.782 --> 34:45.717
- Hi!
-<i>Hi.</i>

34:45.717 --> 34:47.219
- Hi.
-<i>I...</i>

34:47.219 --> 34:51.457
I wanted to call
to check in about today.

34:51.457 --> 34:54.025
- That's... That's nice of you.
-<i>But, um...</i>

34:54.025 --> 34:56.027
I'm just
gonna come out and say it.

34:56.027 --> 34:58.364
I know you really wanted
to play Laurie Francis

34:58.364 --> 35:01.032
<i>I really wanted you
to play her too.</i>

35:01.032 --> 35:04.136
<i>- I mean, I wrote it...</i>
- I didn't get it, did I?

35:05.571 --> 35:06.472
I'm sorry.

35:07.873 --> 35:08.874
<i>Don't be.</i>

35:11.543 --> 35:13.179
Um...

35:13.179 --> 35:16.148
So, um, so, who got the role?

35:16.148 --> 35:17.516
<i>Do you know who...</i>

35:17.516 --> 35:19.551
Jackie Dennon...

35:20.852 --> 35:23.021
<i>is?</i> -Yeah.

35:23.021 --> 35:24.323
Yeah, I know who she is.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.625
She's... She's good.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.660
<i>Yeah, she is.</i>

35:28.660 --> 35:31.397
<i>Uh, and she didn't audition,</i>

35:31.397 --> 35:34.600
<i>but Mazie's making
a name for herself these days.</i>

35:34.600 --> 35:38.003
<i>So, I... Uh, we,
the team offered her,</i>

35:38.003 --> 35:39.471
<i>uh, one of
the supporting roles.</i>

35:40.038 --> 35:40.972
Oh.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.575
Well, uh...

35:44.943 --> 35:47.078
I was thinking,

35:47.078 --> 35:50.716
uh, you know, you could
understudy Jackie,

35:50.716 --> 35:53.319
<i>since you know
the role so well.</i>

35:54.653 --> 35:56.054
- Oh.
- I should add that

35:56.054 --> 35:58.457
the understudy would also be
a part of the ensemble.

35:58.457 --> 35:59.558
Um...

35:59.558 --> 36:00.459
<i>I know that's probably not</i>

36:00.459 --> 36:01.727
<i>something you're
interested in.</i>

36:01.727 --> 36:02.594
<i>- But...</i>
- I'll do it.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.596
Yep.

36:06.565 --> 36:10.469
I'm... I'm so happy
to hear that.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.504
<i>Uh...</i>

36:17.008 --> 36:18.109
I actually have to go.

36:18.977 --> 36:20.078
<i>- Have a good one.</i>
- Yeah.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.247
I'll see you soon.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.048
- Yeah, see you soon.
<i>- Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

36:23.048 --> 36:24.883
Bye, bye.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.090
"To bait fish withal:

36:32.090 --> 36:37.496
"if it will feed nothing else
it will feed my revenge."

36:45.136 --> 36:46.071
Hello?

36:48.374 --> 36:50.242
Mmm. What are you doing?

36:51.443 --> 36:52.511
Nothing.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.615
That pie is old.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.049
Still tastes
pretty good to me.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.319
How'd the call go?

37:01.720 --> 37:03.455
What did old dumb-dumb
have to say?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.627
He gave the part
to Jackie Dennon.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.028
Oh, fuck. She's good.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.598
- Just doesn't make any sense.
- I watched that show.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.600
Did you see
the finale last year?

37:15.166 --> 37:16.568
When she...

37:17.703 --> 37:19.204
I get emotional
just thinking about it.

37:19.204 --> 37:20.439
He hates famous people.

37:20.439 --> 37:22.274
Yeah, she's
also very talented.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.842
Oh, my God!

37:23.842 --> 37:25.010
- Oh!
-Are you okay?

37:25.010 --> 37:26.445
I just... I feel...

37:28.347 --> 37:29.681
Uh, I feel... I...

37:31.750 --> 37:32.851
-What... you feel...
- Uh.

37:32.851 --> 37:34.353
I don't... I... I don't know.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.554
This doesn't feel good.

37:35.554 --> 37:36.555
Yeah, you look
a little sweaty, too.

37:36.555 --> 37:37.856
- Are you gonna throw up?
- Ah, yeah.

37:37.856 --> 37:39.625
-Yeah.
- Yeah, I really feel that.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.093
-Okay.
- So stupid.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.163
What are you doing?

37:45.163 --> 37:46.732
No, no, no!

37:46.732 --> 37:49.134
- Those are my mother's.
- Even better.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.036
Monster, don't!

37:54.139 --> 37:56.241
- What is wrong with you?
- Your turn.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.444
Laura, try one.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.213
Trust me. You'll feel better.

38:02.213 --> 38:03.715
Stop holding it in.

38:04.783 --> 38:05.717
Do it.

38:07.353 --> 38:08.720
Come on! Come on!

38:09.955 --> 38:13.224
Yeah! How'd that feel?

38:13.224 --> 38:14.826
- Actually felt good.
- Feels pretty good, huh?

38:14.826 --> 38:16.227
-Yeah.
- Here do another one.

38:16.227 --> 38:17.829
Give me another one. Okay.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.732
Oh, yeah!

38:21.567 --> 38:24.269
Oh, my God!

38:24.269 --> 38:25.571
Look at you being bad.

38:26.738 --> 38:29.007
- You're in trouble.
- Whoa! Shit.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.275
Oh, it's on now.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.746
No, no, no. This is my side.

38:34.746 --> 38:35.747
Take the other side.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.760
You're a mess.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.762
You're a mess.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.534
Two weeks have gone by fast.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.638
Really? Been two weeks?

39:00.839 --> 39:01.773
Yep.

39:03.609 --> 39:07.212
I guess, uh, that's my time.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.783
I should... get out.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.620
- Pack my shit.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.887
- I remember it all.
- Hit the pavement.

39:15.887 --> 39:16.988
I remember
those things that I said.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.391
Thank you for reminding me.

39:19.391 --> 39:21.527
Uh-huh. So...

39:23.495 --> 39:25.464
- I better get on that.
- Yep.

39:31.202 --> 39:31.903
Stay.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.577
I mean, only,
only if you want to.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.349
Okay.

40:11.009 --> 40:13.479
I'm sorry. I just...
Is anybody sitting here?

40:13.479 --> 40:14.713
Yeah. No! No!

40:14.713 --> 40:15.981
- I mean, no! Uh...
- Yes?

40:15.981 --> 40:18.550
- That's you. You are.
- Oh, okay. Great.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.785
That's who's sitting there.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.153
- Hi, I'm Jackie.
- I'm Laurie.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.154
- Oh!
- Oh, sorry.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.957
Uh, I'm... I'm Laura.

40:25.957 --> 40:27.025
- Not Laurie. You're Laurie.
-Nice to meet you.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.560
- It's so nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

40:28.560 --> 40:29.695
I know who you are.

40:29.695 --> 40:30.862
Can I ask
you a question?

40:30.862 --> 40:33.298
- Uh, yeah.
- Does my hair look insane?

40:33.298 --> 40:34.800
It's like so windy outside.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.902
Um, yeah.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.537
-It does?
- It looks insane.

40:38.537 --> 40:40.238
- Oh, no. It does?
- Insanely good.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.073
Oh.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.475
That's funny.

40:43.475 --> 40:44.910
You look flawless.

40:44.910 --> 40:45.877
<i>Shabbat Shalom,</i>

40:45.877 --> 40:46.745
fuckers!

40:46.745 --> 40:48.647
-Hey.
- Hi.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.448
- I texted you.
- Sorry.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.752
Look, it's famed director
Jacob Sullivan.

40:54.085 --> 40:55.754
Gonna behave
yourself today, Mazie?

40:56.021 --> 40:56.722
Are you?

40:58.624 --> 40:59.825
Hi, Laura.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.260
- Hey.
-Hi.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.729
Don McBride.

41:03.729 --> 41:05.564
Stage Manager.
I'll be managing...

41:05.564 --> 41:06.898
You know what
I'm managing.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.900
Reading starts in five...

41:08.900 --> 41:10.569
Five, five!

41:13.304 --> 41:15.406
"We cannot all succeed,

41:17.442 --> 41:19.410
"when half of us
are held back."

41:22.280 --> 41:23.582
Malala Yousafzai.

41:25.651 --> 41:27.252
Thought I'd start
with a quote.

41:28.219 --> 41:32.357
Hello and welcome to the

41:32.357 --> 41:34.392
first rehearsal
of <i>House of Good Women.</i>

41:39.430 --> 41:45.370
This piece, as stated
in the title is, um,

41:46.437 --> 41:50.275
a love letter to women.

41:50.275 --> 41:51.810
It's an acknowledgement.

41:51.810 --> 41:56.081
An acknowledgement
of the terrible burden

41:56.081 --> 41:57.983
that society places on women.

41:58.483 --> 41:59.484
And a...

42:00.351 --> 42:03.689
tribute to the strength,

42:05.523 --> 42:06.625
and the courage

42:07.993 --> 42:13.799
that women use
to overcome that oppression.

42:13.799 --> 42:16.602
But, uh, before we get started
on the read-through,

42:16.602 --> 42:20.005
I want to introduce
our leading lady.

42:20.005 --> 42:26.812
The incandescent,
the brilliant Jackie Dennon,

42:26.812 --> 42:28.847
as Laurie Francis.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.149
Thank you, Jackie,
for being here.

42:52.604 --> 42:53.772
All right.

43:30.876 --> 43:33.344
Don't forget to send
your, uh, conflict dates

43:33.344 --> 43:35.313
to Don.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.048
Oh, and more importantly,

43:37.048 --> 43:38.850
the theater is having
a Halloween party here

43:38.850 --> 43:41.753
on Saturday,
and we're all invited.

43:41.753 --> 43:44.355
Oh, yay!
Ooh, fun. Cast bonding.

43:44.355 --> 43:46.524
Hey, uh,
I'll meet you outside.

43:46.524 --> 43:48.860
I can bring, like,
10, 20 people.

43:48.860 --> 43:50.528
What?

43:50.528 --> 43:51.730
Hey, it's
a masterpiece, bro.

43:54.199 --> 43:55.867
Hey.-Hey.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.936
- Uh, your first table read.
- Yeah.

43:57.936 --> 44:00.371
- How do you feel?
- Thanks. Yeah, it's surreal.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.040
You're doing great, already.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.342
- Not that I need to tell you.
- Oh, thank you.

44:04.342 --> 44:06.678
- Um...
- Um, hey, I was...

44:06.678 --> 44:08.513
I was hoping we'd find
a chance to...

44:08.513 --> 44:09.580
Hey, Jacob.

44:09.580 --> 44:10.782
- Oh, sorry.
- No, no, no.

44:10.782 --> 44:12.250
- I didn't mean to interrupt.
- You're okay.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.618
Just wondering if I could
snag you for a quick second.

44:14.219 --> 44:15.520
Uh, yeah. Sorry.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.621
- Being snagged.
-Yeah, yeah.

44:16.621 --> 44:18.123
Uh, but maybe we can talk
on Saturday?

44:18.123 --> 44:19.257
You gonna go?

44:19.257 --> 44:21.793
Maybe we'll be there,
maybe we won't.

44:21.793 --> 44:23.862
Hey, Don, we're gonna steal
some costumes.

44:23.862 --> 44:25.463
- Not allowed.
-Yes, we are.

44:25.463 --> 44:27.032
Wait,

44:27.032 --> 44:29.400
what were you last year
for Halloween again?

44:29.400 --> 44:30.702
Eleanor Roosevelt.

44:30.702 --> 44:32.871
Oof! And the year before that?

44:32.871 --> 44:35.106
Abraham Lincoln.
Ugh! God, Laura.

44:36.908 --> 44:38.910
Ooh, I think
you should bring a date.

44:38.910 --> 44:40.979
No, I don't think
I'm ready for that.

44:40.979 --> 44:42.981
Yeah, well,
I'm bringing one.

44:42.981 --> 44:45.383
He's this weird guy that
I met at karate last week.

44:45.383 --> 44:48.653
He's, kind of, like, stressed,
but I like it.

44:52.858 --> 44:54.559
- What do you think?
- Oh, my God. No.

44:54.559 --> 44:55.794
What?

45:02.267 --> 45:03.668
No solicitations please.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.670
Ha, ha, very funny.

45:09.307 --> 45:10.008
What's happening?

45:11.042 --> 45:12.010
Um...

45:13.678 --> 45:15.814
You got any plans tonight?

45:15.814 --> 45:17.682
Wouldn't you like to know?

45:18.984 --> 45:20.786
No, I have no plans.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.020
- What's up?
- Well...

45:22.020 --> 45:24.790
There's this Halloween party
at the theatre.

45:24.790 --> 45:26.858
-Hmm.
- And I was thinking...

45:29.227 --> 45:31.329
Since you're already dressed
for the occasion,

45:31.329 --> 45:32.998
that maybe you'd like
to come with me.

45:32.998 --> 45:35.133
Are you asking me
out on a date?

45:35.133 --> 45:35.867
No.

45:37.235 --> 45:38.203
No.

45:40.071 --> 45:41.172
Well, I'm not gonna
leave the house.

45:42.140 --> 45:43.308
Why not?

45:43.308 --> 45:46.011
Because I'm a monster,
for one thing, and also,

45:46.011 --> 45:47.879
I don't wanna hang out
with your ex-boyfriend

45:47.879 --> 45:49.647
and a bunch
of musical theatre dorks.

45:49.647 --> 45:50.648
Well, I'm
a musical theatre dork.

45:50.648 --> 45:52.483
Why don't you just stay here?

45:52.483 --> 45:53.952
It'll be fun.

45:53.952 --> 45:55.186
We can fuck around
with trick-o-treaters

45:55.186 --> 45:56.187
all night.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.123
Well, our whole cast is
going so...

45:58.123 --> 46:00.959
- Oh, well, in that case.
- Please.

46:00.959 --> 46:02.627
Limp dick, fuck face
has enough friends.

46:02.627 --> 46:04.963
- Stop calling him that.
- What are you gonna do?

46:04.963 --> 46:05.897
Kiss his ass all night
and then come home

46:05.897 --> 46:07.465
and throw a pity party
for yourself?

46:07.465 --> 46:09.734
I'm not gonna come home
and throw myself a pity party.

46:09.734 --> 46:10.735
Yeah, right.

46:11.870 --> 46:13.404
- Please.
- I said no.

46:14.906 --> 46:16.307
Fine!-Fine.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.275
Fine.-Fine!

46:17.275 --> 46:19.777
- I'll go alone.
- Yeah, you do that.

46:21.246 --> 46:23.581
Well, you can...
Can you get out of my room?

46:23.581 --> 46:24.749
'Cause I need to change.

46:25.884 --> 46:28.920
I was gonna
make a salad anyway.

47:06.324 --> 47:07.492
Hi.

47:08.393 --> 47:09.327
Hi.

47:12.898 --> 47:14.299
You look, um...

47:15.766 --> 47:17.468
What?

47:17.468 --> 47:18.803
- Is it too much?
- No.

47:21.406 --> 47:22.107
You look nice.

47:26.978 --> 47:27.946
Thank you.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.851
- Um, you know you could...
-Hmm?

47:35.320 --> 47:37.022
- ...still.
-I should probably...

47:39.190 --> 47:41.759
- Probably just...
- Yeah, right.

47:41.759 --> 47:44.996
Uh, well, have a good night.

48:08.486 --> 48:09.187
Laura.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.257
Merry Christmas!

48:12.257 --> 48:14.592
- Yeah.
-That's just a joke.

48:14.592 --> 48:16.261
Happy Halloween.

48:16.261 --> 48:19.830
- It's Don.
- Yeah, I know.

48:20.631 --> 48:22.000
You look great, Don.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.501
I really... I really like
your costume.

48:23.501 --> 48:25.103
Really?-Yeah.

48:25.103 --> 48:26.437
Yeah?-Uh...

48:27.405 --> 48:29.207
Yeah.

48:29.207 --> 48:31.309
Good costume to you, too.

48:31.309 --> 48:32.777
She doesn't wanna
talk to you, Don.

48:34.812 --> 48:35.913
Excuse me.

48:43.888 --> 48:44.889
Laura.

48:46.357 --> 48:47.858
Wow.

48:47.858 --> 48:50.528
Wow, to you too, my liege.

48:51.762 --> 48:52.730
You look great.

48:54.199 --> 48:56.067
Hi!-Jackie.

48:56.067 --> 48:58.970
Wow, your costume is lit.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.174
You look so beautiful.

49:03.174 --> 49:04.809
- You really do.
-Oh, oh. Thank you.

49:07.678 --> 49:09.480
- So do you.
- Oh, thanks.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.949
Equally, equally as beautiful.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.587
Um... Should we...

49:16.587 --> 49:17.922
Do you guys want a drink?
I'll get us drinks.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.024
You get a beer.

49:19.024 --> 49:20.091
You get a beer.
I'll be right back.

49:20.091 --> 49:22.827
- Okay.
- Thank you.

49:22.827 --> 49:25.763
Well, you two seem like
you're friends now.

49:25.763 --> 49:27.598
- That's great.
- Yeah, we actually,

49:27.598 --> 49:30.501
we grabbed a bite
before, uh, before the party.

49:30.501 --> 49:32.703
A bite?
Oh, fun.

49:32.703 --> 49:36.074
Yeah, yeah. I... I like her.

49:38.476 --> 49:40.845
Um, I did... I did wanna say

49:40.845 --> 49:42.947
- to you...
-Okay, guys.

49:42.947 --> 49:45.083
- Two beers for new pals.
- Oh, awesome.

49:45.083 --> 49:46.584
- Cheers.
-Happy Halloween.

49:46.584 --> 49:48.419
Happy Halloween.
Happy, happy, happy.

Is someone there?

55:54.419 --> 55:56.554
Of course. Of course,
he wants to be with her.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.389
I knew it. Of course he does.

55:58.389 --> 55:59.957
Oh, my God!

56:11.836 --> 56:14.439
Why? Why did you have
to hurt him like that?

56:14.439 --> 56:15.573
Because he hurt you!

But, I... But I'm fine.

56:20.277 --> 56:23.247
I'm okay. It's okay.
I'm not an idiot.

56:23.247 --> 56:25.182
She's famous.

56:25.182 --> 56:29.153
She's more talented than me.
She's more beautiful than me.

56:29.153 --> 56:31.522
We're not together anymore.
He doesn't owe me anything.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.491
He doesn't owe me anything.

56:33.491 --> 56:35.793
-It's okay.
- I disagree!

56:35.793 --> 56:37.962
I think it's
specifically not okay.

56:37.962 --> 56:39.296
That prick broke up
with you when you were

56:39.296 --> 56:40.364
in the hospital,

56:41.532 --> 56:44.168
- right after you had surgery.
- Well...

56:44.168 --> 56:45.703
He... He fucking
abandoned you.

56:45.703 --> 56:48.606
And he doesn't
owe you anything?

56:48.606 --> 56:51.108
What... What the hell are you
actually talking about?

56:51.108 --> 56:53.010
- Well, I'm talking about...
- And the musical?

56:53.010 --> 56:54.645
What about the musical?
He wrote a role for you.

56:54.645 --> 56:57.147
Yeah? He told you
it was yours.

56:57.147 --> 56:59.517
That he's gonna make
all your dreams come true.

56:59.517 --> 57:01.519
Is that what he said?
And then a moment later,

57:01.519 --> 57:03.688
it got kind of tough, huh?

57:05.656 --> 57:07.357
And he took it
all away from you.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.529
You did what
you always do here, Laura.

57:11.529 --> 57:14.398
You supported.
Yeah. Look at me.

57:14.398 --> 57:15.600
You supported him,

57:16.233 --> 57:17.802
you listened,

57:17.802 --> 57:19.303
did whatever he needed,
whenever he needed.

57:19.303 --> 57:20.571
And what he did?

57:22.607 --> 57:23.874
Huh? Taking it all
away from you,

57:23.874 --> 57:26.511
just to avoid facing you?
That's not okay.

57:26.511 --> 57:27.878
- But it is okay.
- That's not okay.

57:27.878 --> 57:31.315
- It has to be okay.
- It doesn't have to be okay.

57:31.315 --> 57:32.817
- Yes, it does. Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

57:32.817 --> 57:33.718
It's not okay.

57:39.189 --> 57:40.658
Laura, it's not okay.

57:41.992 --> 57:43.227
It's not.

57:45.195 --> 57:46.497
It's just not.

57:52.737 --> 57:54.605
It's not okay.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.575

01:05:58.488 --> 01:06:01.258
Let's, uh, let's run
through it as an exercise.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:02.692
- Keep it going.
-Okay.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:03.660
Uh...

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:08.398
What's wrong
with girls like me?

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:10.467
He didn't think there was
anything wrong with me.

01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:14.671
When I met him,

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.141
he didn't think there was
anything wrong at all.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.177
I remember...

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:25.415
I remember the first moment
I met him.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:27.217
I remember I said...

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.354
I said to him...

- from everything she knows.
-Mmm-hmm.

01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:07.891
She's recounting

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:11.428
the genesis of a relationship
that nearly destroyed her.

01:07:11.428 --> 01:07:12.562
She's about to break.

happy birthday

at my mom's house.
I'm not getting anything.

- Yeah.
- Like, I, kind of, feel like

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:51.668
I lost you
in the last 24 hours.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:53.270
I don't know where you're at.

01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:55.105
And I don't wanna
have to say the same things

01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:56.640
over and over again,
because if I do

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:58.842
then I feel like my language
no longer has...

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.477
- Yeah, yeah.
- ...kind of any utility.

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:02.212
- You know what I mean?
- Jesus, lay off, Jacob.

01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:06.283
What was that, Laura?

01:08:06.283 --> 01:08:08.051
You got something to say?

01:08:08.051 --> 01:08:10.554
No? While I have you,
you're too far forward.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:13.022
I need you back.
Back, back, back, back.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.326
The scene isn't about you.

01:08:16.326 --> 01:08:17.894
Funny, it used to be.

01:08:19.396 --> 01:08:21.731
Not a good time for that.

01:08:21.731 --> 01:08:23.233
Well, when would be
a good time for that,

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.368
Your Highness?

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:25.569
Maybe after rehearsal.

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:28.338
No, well, actually, no.

01:08:28.338 --> 01:08:30.174
That's... That's not gonna
work for me.

01:08:30.174 --> 01:08:31.908
I wanna talk
about it right now.

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.948
Laura,
you're embarrassing yourself.

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:48.958
You're embarrassing yourself.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:51.661
You think you...

01:08:54.097 --> 01:08:57.066
Hi, I... I'm Jacob Sullivan.

01:08:57.066 --> 01:08:59.236
I'm a pretentious douchebag.

01:08:59.236 --> 01:09:01.738
I think my shit doesn't stink.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:03.072
Well, guess what, Jacob!

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:05.108
I lived in the same apartment
as you for years,

01:09:05.108 --> 01:09:08.178
and I smelled your shit,
and it doesn't smell good.

01:09:08.178 --> 01:09:10.180
- It doesn't smell good.
- Take a break, Laura.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.248
Yeah, sure.

01:09:11.248 --> 01:09:13.016
What else do you need? Oh!

01:09:13.016 --> 01:09:15.885
Uh, I'm hungry, Laura.

01:09:15.885 --> 01:09:17.854
Can you cook me some pasta?

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:19.689
Would you mind,
'cause I'm sitting

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:22.559
on the piano all day
and I just can go

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.861
plunk, plunk, plunk.
I'm useless.

01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.596
I don't wanna do the laundry.

01:09:26.596 --> 01:09:28.798
I don't want to do the dishes.

01:09:28.798 --> 01:09:30.300
I don't want to do anything

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.136
because I'm God's gift
to the world,

01:09:33.136 --> 01:09:35.539
because he can string
a few words together.

01:09:35.539 --> 01:09:36.973
But you know what?
I can string

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:38.775
words together, too, Jacob.

01:09:38.775 --> 01:09:41.211
You limp dick, fuck face!

01:09:41.211 --> 01:09:43.380
All right,
she is letting it out.

01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:45.048
- Laura, let's go outside.
- No, I don't wanna go outside.

01:09:45.048 --> 01:09:46.250
- Why would I wanna go outside?
-Okay, okay.

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:47.884
- It's cold outside.
- Laura. Lower your voice.

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:49.118
I will not lower my voice!

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.454
Don't tell me
to lower my voice!

01:09:50.454 --> 01:09:51.921
You lower your voice!

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:55.459
You're disloyal,
narcissistic piece of shit!

01:09:55.459 --> 01:09:56.960
Asshole!

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.663
Okey-dokey. All right.

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:02.299
Got a little hot here
in the kitchen.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:04.768
Think it's time
to, uh, take five, everybody.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:07.237
That's five. Five!

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:09.339
Thank you so much, everyone.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.074
That's 10, Don.

01:10:11.074 --> 01:10:12.041
Ha!

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:19.483
What?-Nothing.

01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:20.750
You think this is funny?

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:22.586
Yeah, I did. I thought
it was a little funny.

01:10:22.586 --> 01:10:24.254
Nothing about that was funny.
Okay.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.322
Jacob's being an asshole.

01:10:25.322 --> 01:10:26.423
He can't talk
to people like that.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:27.657
Well, directors are assholes,

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.093
and sometimes they do
talk to people like that.

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:33.330
And dude, Jackie is...
Fuck. Butchering the part.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:35.799
I don't blame him.

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:36.866
Okay.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.001
Everyone's hanging out,
can we go?

01:10:38.001 --> 01:10:39.469
No, I'm not hanging out.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:42.005
- Okay, then don't hang out.
- You're just gonna leave.

01:10:42.005 --> 01:10:44.173
- Yeah.
- Why do you always do that?

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:46.310
God, you're
such a shitty friend.

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:48.845
- Shitty friend?
- A shitty friend.

01:10:48.845 --> 01:10:50.179
After everything
I've done for you,

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.515
- that's how you talk to me?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

01:10:51.515 --> 01:10:53.283
Thank you so much, seriously,
for picking me up

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.284
from the hospital
and for doing

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:55.852
the bare minimum, always.

01:10:55.852 --> 01:10:57.220
Thank you so much.

01:10:59.989 --> 01:11:01.558
Sorry, do you have
any other friends,

01:11:03.226 --> 01:11:05.629
any family, a boyfriend?

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.231
Hmm?

01:11:08.231 --> 01:11:09.933
Don't push it, Laura.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.201
Call me when you're you again.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:15.071
This is me.

01:11:15.071 --> 01:11:16.373
Good luck with that.

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:24.581
Damn it!

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.453
We need to talk.

01:11:36.593 --> 01:11:37.861
<i>We're talking
about my behavior?</i>

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:38.928
Are you listening to yourself?

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.096
Goddamn it, Laura.

01:11:41.398 --> 01:11:43.767
I didn't force you
to audition.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:45.502
It was your choice to be here.

01:11:45.502 --> 01:11:47.371
If you can't handle it
because of your own shit,

01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:49.773
- that's on you.
- My own shit?

01:11:49.773 --> 01:11:50.874
We're together
for five years

01:11:50.874 --> 01:11:52.542
and now this is
just my own shit?

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.010
You offered me a role,
and then you tried

01:11:54.010 --> 01:11:55.779
to cut me out.

01:11:55.779 --> 01:11:57.847
- You tried to cut me out.
- We broke up.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.149
We broke up.

01:12:01.385 --> 01:12:03.219
It's hard for me
to be around you.

01:12:03.219 --> 01:12:04.521
I don't wanna be around you.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:07.891
I have to sit and watch
someone else play my role

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:09.192
that you wrote for me,

01:12:09.192 --> 01:12:10.760
that I helped you build.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.962
Because I workshopped
every single song,

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.965
and every single scene
in this show with you, Jacob.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:18.234
I read every single iteration

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.437
and version
of your stupid book,

01:12:20.437 --> 01:12:21.771
so you could hear it out loud.

01:12:21.771 --> 01:12:24.007
You were my girlfriend.
You were my girlfriend.

01:12:26.676 --> 01:12:29.379
Why did you offer me
the role, Jacob?

01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:30.814
Why did you paint
the whole picture for me

01:12:30.814 --> 01:12:32.516
if you were just gonna
take it all away?

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:34.283
Why?

01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:38.488
Is it because
we were sleeping together?

01:12:40.524 --> 01:12:42.992
Is the role of Laurie Francis
exclusively reserved...

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:44.293
...for the woman

01:12:44.293 --> 01:12:46.496
that you're fucking
at the moment? Is that it?

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:47.731
What are you talking about?

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:52.669
I saw you
at the Halloween party.

01:12:54.137 --> 01:12:56.005
I saw you with Jackie.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:58.274
I saw you
and I wish I didn't care.

01:12:58.274 --> 01:13:00.109
I shouldn't care.

01:13:00.109 --> 01:13:03.179
But, I still care.

01:13:03.179 --> 01:13:06.450
For some reason, I do.
I can't help it.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.585
And I still love you.

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:12.489
And I...
I wish I didn't.

01:13:14.323 --> 01:13:16.159
I hate myself for it.

01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:20.430
And I hate that I have you
on this stupid pedestal,

01:13:20.430 --> 01:13:22.365
and I can't stop
feeling this way.

01:13:22.365 --> 01:13:24.601
And I don't want to anymore.

01:13:24.601 --> 01:13:26.302
And I don't know how to stop.

01:13:26.302 --> 01:13:28.805
And I just need you
to tell me.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:29.606
How did you do it?

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:34.778
How, Jacob?

01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:40.617
How did you stop loving me?

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:49.726
How could you do that to me?

01:14:25.695 --> 01:14:27.731
I spoke to the creative team.

01:14:32.368 --> 01:14:33.837
This is so fucked up.

01:14:36.039 --> 01:14:37.306
You can't be in the show.

01:14:39.275 --> 01:14:40.510
You're a liability.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:46.482
I'm sorry.

01:15:05.401 --> 01:15:07.103
Monster?

01:15:07.103 --> 01:15:08.605
Sorry, I'm late.

01:15:31.327 --> 01:15:32.528
Monster, are you in there?

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:04.493

01:16:33.056 --> 01:16:33.790
Laura.

01:16:35.158 --> 01:16:36.259
What is this place?

01:16:36.259 --> 01:16:40.163
It's, uh, well...
It's kinda where I live.

01:16:40.163 --> 01:16:42.298
It's just, uh...
It's a mess right now.

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:44.167
Um...

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.302
It's... I need
to organize all this stuff.

01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:48.738
But, uh, I don't know.

01:16:48.738 --> 01:16:50.740
Uh, one man's trash
is another man's...

01:16:51.607 --> 01:16:53.042
You get it.

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:56.680
Wow.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:58.614
Yeah.
Rehearsal ran late?

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.084
Uh...

01:17:02.051 --> 01:17:03.419
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:05.154
Sorry about that.

01:17:08.257 --> 01:17:09.625
Everything okay?

01:17:10.593 --> 01:17:11.928
Everything is fine.

01:17:13.362 --> 01:17:15.732
Why do you ask?

01:17:15.732 --> 01:17:18.668
Um, well, you're
not looking at me in the eye,

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:19.769
for one thing.

01:17:22.205 --> 01:17:23.472
What?

01:17:24.808 --> 01:17:26.075
Yes.

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.944
- Ah, I...
- You're not looking me

01:17:27.944 --> 01:17:28.678
in the eye.

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:30.446
What's up there?

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:31.647
Um, it's...

01:17:32.248 --> 01:17:33.182
I'm right here.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.618
Yeah, ugh, I'm sorry.

01:17:35.618 --> 01:17:36.786
Yeah, I'm sorry, okay?

01:17:36.786 --> 01:17:40.023
I'm sorry. I just had
a very shitty day.

01:17:41.224 --> 01:17:42.525
Okay. What happened?

01:17:44.728 --> 01:17:47.430
- I got fired.
- What? How?

01:17:48.264 --> 01:17:50.834
I... might have had a...

01:17:54.403 --> 01:17:57.440
...meltdown during rehearsal.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.443
And...
Then after that,

01:18:00.443 --> 01:18:04.447
I... I fought with Mazie.

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:07.717
Uh-huh.

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:10.153
And, um...

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:14.724
And then, um...

01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.528
Well, Jacob, um,

01:18:21.865 --> 01:18:25.568
wanted to talk with me
after rehearsal.

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:28.571
So I... stayed.

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.041
Um...

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:33.877
Yeah.

01:18:35.278 --> 01:18:36.579
How did that talk go?

01:18:37.346 --> 01:18:38.581
It wasn't...

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.251
It was, like, more like, um...

01:18:44.287 --> 01:18:45.021
Did you guys...

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:48.091
kiss or something?

01:18:57.066 --> 01:18:57.901
I'm sorry.

01:18:57.901 --> 01:19:00.003
-Mmm.
- I'm so sorry.

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:06.409
I'm so sorry.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:14.683
Why?

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:16.786
I don't know.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:18.888
- Why would you do that?
- I don't know.

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:19.956
He doesn't love you.

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:22.291
He doesn't love you.

01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:23.026
He never has.

01:19:23.827 --> 01:19:25.294
That, no. That's...

01:19:25.294 --> 01:19:26.729
- He doesn't love you.
- Don't say that.

01:19:26.729 --> 01:19:28.464
- That's not true.
- It is true.

01:19:28.464 --> 01:19:30.166
He doesn't love you the way
you deserve to be loved.

01:19:30.166 --> 01:19:33.069
Oh, come on.
I deserve to be loved?

01:19:33.069 --> 01:19:35.204
What do you know about
how I deserve to be loved?

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:36.505
I happen to know
a fuck ton about it

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:37.673
if you looked around.

01:19:37.673 --> 01:19:38.875
You don't know
anything about love.

01:19:38.875 --> 01:19:41.044
You're a fucking monster.

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.813
You've spent your whole life
hiding in here.

01:19:43.813 --> 01:19:46.482
I wasn't hiding.

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:48.151
You shut me in here.

01:19:48.151 --> 01:19:50.153
You didn't want anything
to do with me.

01:19:50.153 --> 01:19:51.687
Of course, I didn't want
anything to do with you.

01:19:51.687 --> 01:19:54.390
Look at you!
You're disgusting!

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:55.724
You're horrible!

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.393
And you ruined my life!

01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:59.395
And you've stolen
all my socks!

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:00.596
You were never
gonna do anything

01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:02.198
- with those fucking socks.
- Yes, I was!

01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:03.532
I needed those socks.

01:20:03.532 --> 01:20:05.434
You know what?
Maybe I'm disgusting,

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:06.735
but if it wasn't for me,

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:09.839
you'd still be a pathetic,
weepy doormat,

01:20:09.839 --> 01:20:11.407
crying in a corner,

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.209
playing the helpless victim,

01:20:13.209 --> 01:20:15.444
letting the world trample
all over you.

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:16.545
Is that who you wanna be, huh?

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.580
- I'm leaving.
- You might as well

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.415
roll over and fucking die.

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:21.017
- How can you say that to me?
- Look at yourself.

01:20:21.017 --> 01:20:23.019
- How can you say that to me?
- Look at yourself, Laura.

01:20:23.019 --> 01:20:24.921
- Laura, look at yourself.
- I am looking at myself.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:27.356
Come on.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:30.559
Laura!

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:32.395
Come on.

01:20:32.395 --> 01:20:34.763
Laura.

01:20:34.763 --> 01:20:36.465
- Come on, let me out.
- No!

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:38.534
- Go away!
-Let me out!

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:40.269
- Go away.
- Don't do this again.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:41.270
Laura.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.641
Fine, you want me gone?

01:20:48.444 --> 01:20:49.512
Fine.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:52.615
I'm gone.

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:26.649
I'm sorry.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:37.826
Monster?

01:21:52.141 --> 01:21:52.908
Monster.

01:22:05.354 --> 01:22:06.289
Monster?

01:22:09.993 --> 01:22:11.427
Monster, I'm sorry.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:14.964
Monster, where are you?

01:22:16.165 --> 01:22:18.234
I'm really sorry.
Please, come back.

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:21.737
Please.

01:22:21.737 --> 01:22:23.639
Please don't leave me.

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:26.042
Monster, please, don't...

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.177
Please, don't leave me.

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:29.545
Please, come back.

01:22:33.216 --> 01:22:35.218
I'm sorry.

01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:48.697
Okay, I am so sorry

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:51.067
to have kept you waiting.

01:22:51.067 --> 01:22:52.768
Wow, Laura.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:55.171
You are looking like
you're feeling much better.

01:22:55.171 --> 01:22:57.273
I don't feel great.

01:22:57.273 --> 01:23:00.176
Well, let me turn that
frown upside down.

01:23:01.244 --> 01:23:03.679
You are cleared, young lady.

01:23:06.082 --> 01:23:07.016
You...

01:23:08.217 --> 01:23:10.286
You're cancer-free, kid.
That's good news.

01:23:12.055 --> 01:23:13.289
What do I do now?

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.691
I don't know.

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.626
Call somebody. Go celebrate!

01:23:17.626 --> 01:23:19.628
Hit the town!

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:21.664
Eat a jelly bean.
You want a jelly bean?

01:23:23.099 --> 01:23:24.133
Take a hand...

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:29.998
So, listen,
I just wanted to say,

01:24:32.335 --> 01:24:34.670
thank you for sticking up
for me the other day.

01:24:36.105 --> 01:24:37.506
Um, and also...

01:24:39.242 --> 01:24:42.211
I'm really, really sorry.

01:24:42.211 --> 01:24:43.879
It's okay.
You don't have to be sorry.

01:24:43.879 --> 01:24:46.949
No, I... I genuinely
didn't know that

01:24:46.949 --> 01:24:50.453
- I was, like, stealing...
- Oh, no.

01:24:50.453 --> 01:24:53.055
You weren't stealing him.
It's okay.

01:24:53.055 --> 01:24:55.858
I mean, people hook up.

01:24:55.858 --> 01:24:57.460
- It's fine.
- Wait, did you... I'm sorry.

01:24:57.460 --> 01:24:59.362
Did you just say hook up?

01:24:59.362 --> 01:25:02.531
Yeah. I mean, I saw you
and Jacob hooking up

01:25:02.531 --> 01:25:03.999
at the Halloween party.
It's okay.

01:25:03.999 --> 01:25:05.168
- Oh, my God!
- I don't care.

01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:07.203
- No, no, no, no.
- It's over. Between us.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:10.339
No, no. I've literally never
hooked up with Jacob.

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:13.309
Like not even close. Ever.

01:25:13.309 --> 01:25:15.144
- But I saw you with him.
- No.

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:17.880
He just was
really flirty with me.

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.749
And I... I... I didn't
really know what to do

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.385
because he's my boss.
So I just was, kind of,

01:25:22.385 --> 01:25:23.952
going along with it, but...

01:25:26.922 --> 01:25:29.425
- Okay.
- The truth is, um,

01:25:29.425 --> 01:25:31.660
I just really wanted
to check in on you,

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:34.663
'cause I didn't know
that you were sick,

01:25:34.663 --> 01:25:36.332
or that you
and Jacob were together,

01:25:36.332 --> 01:25:39.168
or had just broken up.
I didn't know any of that.

01:25:39.168 --> 01:25:41.904
And then I found out
that he fired you.

01:25:41.904 --> 01:25:43.472
- Yeah, well.
- Is he okay?

01:25:44.273 --> 01:25:46.509
Like that's insane.

01:25:46.509 --> 01:25:47.676
Laurie, Laura?

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.247
He shouldn't be able
to get away with this.

01:25:51.247 --> 01:25:52.248
He can.

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:53.616
And he will.

01:25:58.954 --> 01:26:00.122
Unless...

01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:23.379
Laura,
don't make me regret this.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:37.560
<i>Is someone there?</i>

01:27:17.866 --> 01:27:20.168
Laura? Laura, what are
you doing here?

01:27:21.704 --> 01:27:24.172
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:27:25.874 --> 01:27:27.976
We... We started spending
more time together

01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:29.512
and I was waiting
for the right time to tell you

01:27:29.512 --> 01:27:30.713
and you were sick.

01:27:30.713 --> 01:27:32.715
And I was scared,
and he was scared.

01:27:32.715 --> 01:27:34.817
And I know
it's really bad!

01:27:34.817 --> 01:27:36.952
It's really fucking bad!

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:43.058
I'm such an idiot.
I'm really sorry.

01:27:46.562 --> 01:27:48.697
Please, forgive me.

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:50.399
-Mazie.
- Laura, please.

01:27:50.399 --> 01:27:52.368
- I'm sorry, Laura, please.
- Get out of my room.

01:27:52.368 --> 01:27:55.270
Okay, okay. Sorry.

01:28:17.526 --> 01:28:20.228
Copy, okay.
That is a go for places.

01:28:20.228 --> 01:28:23.566
Go for places.
