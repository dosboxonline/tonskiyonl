00:34.318 --> 00:38.696
Prepare thyself
for one twisted tale.

00:40.282 --> 00:44.911
Through the chapters of time,
legends have been told

00:44.995 --> 00:48.372
of brave knights,
evil warlocks,

00:48.457 --> 00:52.627
beautiful maidens,
magical prophecies,

00:52.794 --> 00:55.588
and other serious shit.

01:01.678 --> 01:04.013
Be not afraid.

01:04.181 --> 01:06.015
This is your destiny.

01:06.850 --> 01:08.851
You will bear my seed,

01:09.353 --> 01:11.938
giving birth
to a new beast,

01:12.898 --> 01:14.398
a new age.

01:14.733 --> 01:19.320
An age where I will
command mankind in fear!

01:22.240 --> 01:23.616
To arms!

01:35.963 --> 01:37.880
At ease, Maiden.

01:39.591 --> 01:41.717
When the light of
the world flickers,

01:41.885 --> 01:43.469
we, the Golden Order
of Knights,

01:43.553 --> 01:45.429
restore the rule
of good.

01:45.597 --> 01:46.764
You're safe now.

01:47.391 --> 01:48.891
Then let us pray

01:49.059 --> 01:52.311
that 100 years from now when
these two moons meet again,

01:52.396 --> 01:56.273
there will be a hero
as brave as you, my lord.

01:58.527 --> 02:00.736
A hero as brave.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.497
Oh, fuck me.

02:11.581 --> 02:13.082
Prince Thadeous of Mourne,

02:13.417 --> 02:16.085
you are hereby sentenced
to death by hanging

02:16.211 --> 02:17.753
for your
illicit behavior

02:17.838 --> 02:20.923
with the noble Dwarf King's
second wife Regina.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.051
You're a disgrace
to any kingdom!

02:24.136 --> 02:26.345
I say hang the bastard.

02:26.638 --> 02:27.930
Get on with it!

02:28.098 --> 02:29.765
And your minstrel,
Courtney,

02:29.933 --> 02:31.642
is to be tarred
and feathered

02:31.768 --> 02:34.729
for unlawful association
with a deviant.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.440
Children, I'm allergic,
please. Let's not.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.943
Please! These allegations,
they're being greatly exaggerated.

02:41.278 --> 02:43.195
It was more or less
just heavy petting

02:43.280 --> 02:45.906
with a brief moment
of penetration.

02:47.159 --> 02:48.743
Disgusting!

02:48.910 --> 02:51.662
He deserves to die! Kill
him! Hang the bastard!

02:51.788 --> 02:53.914
Hey! Easy!
That's not nice.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.208
You, bloodthirsty
little fucker!

02:56.293 --> 02:58.627
Show me some respect,
I'm a prince!

02:59.129 --> 03:01.255
To the bowels of hell!

03:01.339 --> 03:02.339
Good night, Prince.

03:02.632 --> 03:04.008
Oh, dear gods.

03:15.479 --> 03:16.979
Your Highness,
what are you doing?

03:17.064 --> 03:18.230
I'm escaping, Courtney!

03:18.315 --> 03:20.483
Quit playing with those
children and help me!

03:21.359 --> 03:22.401
Kill him!

03:23.278 --> 03:24.612
Get him! After him!

03:24.696 --> 03:25.738
Your Highness,
wait for me!

03:25.822 --> 03:26.781
Why are they upset?

03:26.865 --> 03:28.532
All dwarf queens
are unfaithful.

03:28.950 --> 03:30.659
Hurry, Courtney,
back to the kingdom!

03:30.744 --> 03:32.787
Forgive us
with your tiny hearts!

03:32.996 --> 03:34.580
Faster sheepies,
faster!

03:34.664 --> 03:35.873
Please wait, sir!

03:36.500 --> 03:38.959
Courtney, you've proven
yourself useless yet again.

03:39.044 --> 03:40.169
Who's that?

03:40.462 --> 03:41.670
We're safe
and we're stoned.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.963
Ganja!

03:44.049 --> 03:45.091
They're gaining on us.

03:45.175 --> 03:46.175
Oh, the dragon!

03:46.343 --> 03:48.052
Those Highland Dwarves
have got weapons!

03:48.178 --> 03:49.220
Coming through.

03:49.346 --> 03:50.596
Boobies!

03:52.390 --> 03:53.557
Watch out, Courtney!

03:55.519 --> 03:56.811
I'm telling father
we should go

03:56.895 --> 03:59.188
to war with these
double-crossers.

04:00.357 --> 04:02.358
Poultry!

04:02.526 --> 04:04.944
Livestock! Courtney, this
is no time to be napping.

04:05.028 --> 04:06.570
I'm a chicken.

04:07.697 --> 04:09.490
Let's get back...
Oh, look!

04:09.574 --> 04:11.826
Mmm. A little feast to
break up this pursuit.

04:11.993 --> 04:13.285
Dangerous,
yet delicious.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.578
I'm jumping
out this window.

04:16.331 --> 04:17.665
He's angry!

04:17.833 --> 04:19.291
Courtney, break my
fall with your body.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.961
Ow! Please don't hurt my bottom!

04:23.130 --> 04:25.131
Run, Courtney!
Pick up the pace!

04:25.215 --> 04:27.550
Why do people
so little run so fast?

04:39.062 --> 04:40.062
That was close.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.939
Courtney, I've had
enough of this nonsense!

04:42.607 --> 04:44.150
Crack-a-lacka,
you little varmint.

04:44.234 --> 04:45.818
They're devils, sir!
They're devils!

04:46.069 --> 04:48.028
Get him!
They're muscular.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.905
Get off me!
That's it, sir!

04:50.240 --> 04:51.699
Your Highness!

04:59.207 --> 05:01.834
Please tell me that you
completed your simple task

05:01.918 --> 05:05.504
and secured the treaty signed
by the Lord of the Dwarf Village.

05:05.797 --> 05:07.673
Father, they sent
a beautiful woman

05:07.757 --> 05:09.592
to distract me and
I was defenseless.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.969
Don't bandy words
with me, Thadeous.

05:12.053 --> 05:14.680
Your brother is to return
from his quest at any moment.

05:14.764 --> 05:16.807
Please go
and bathe yourself.

05:17.058 --> 05:18.809
Why must I bow
to greet him?

05:18.977 --> 05:20.561
No one does
anything special for me

05:20.645 --> 05:22.438
when I do
extraordinary things.

05:22.772 --> 05:25.024
And what extraordinary things
have you done of late?

05:25.108 --> 05:26.942
Do tell me.
Enlighten me.

05:27.277 --> 05:29.403
Courtney, what extraordinary
things have I done?

05:30.196 --> 05:32.865
You took a bubble bath,
ate some toast,

05:32.949 --> 05:34.575
had a sleep
for one hour,

05:34.659 --> 05:38.287
and commissioned a naked
statue of your fine self.

05:39.873 --> 05:41.957
God, if your mother
could see you now.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.752
Hear ye! Hear ye!

05:46.212 --> 05:47.463
Oh, dear gods.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.924
It is with
blossoming personal joy

05:50.550 --> 05:53.552
that I announce
the return of the mighty,

05:53.637 --> 05:55.888
the magnificent,
the merciful,

05:56.181 --> 05:58.849
Prince Fabious!

06:08.193 --> 06:11.028
Hey, Prince Fabious, we adore you!

06:11.112 --> 06:12.613
Welcome home,
Prince Fabious.

06:12.697 --> 06:13.781
You're my king,
Prince Fabious.

06:14.032 --> 06:17.034
Welcome home!
You are adored.

06:17.327 --> 06:18.369
It's Prince Fabious!

06:20.288 --> 06:22.748
Prince Fabious,
I'm here for you now.

06:22.958 --> 06:24.750
Brother!

06:26.544 --> 06:29.088
Oh, my god,
I missed you so.

06:29.172 --> 06:32.591
Great to see you.

06:32.759 --> 06:34.218
Father.

06:34.302 --> 06:35.386
My son.

06:37.222 --> 06:38.347
Welcome home.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.099
As you all know,

06:40.266 --> 06:42.643
the evil wizard Leezar
has plagued our kingdom

06:42.727 --> 06:45.604
with his foul creatures
and wicked ways for years.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.565
But with my brave
trusted knights

06:48.733 --> 06:49.692
and my dear Simon.

06:50.902 --> 06:53.487
Join us,
my mechanical friend.

06:54.197 --> 06:58.325
We have dispatched the latest
of these cold blooded enemies.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.536
Behold!

07:01.037 --> 07:05.541
The head of
Leezar's mighty Cyclops!

07:09.087 --> 07:10.212
Fuck, yeah!

07:10.380 --> 07:12.881
Fabious! Fabious! Fabious!

07:20.974 --> 07:26.311
Once again, Prince Fabious has made
me as proud as a father could ever be.

07:26.479 --> 07:28.856
All the land
owes him gratitude.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.567
This is not
the only good news

07:31.651 --> 07:33.652
that I've brought
home with me today.

07:34.070 --> 07:37.990
Father, Brother,
kingdom...

07:40.076 --> 07:41.827
She is radiant!

07:42.162 --> 07:44.747
I'd like you
to meet my bride-to-be.

07:44.914 --> 07:46.331
Belladonna.

07:52.047 --> 07:53.380
Belladonna, my dear,

07:53.465 --> 07:55.883
why don't you delight us
with your story.

07:56.051 --> 07:59.053
Oh, no. It's a story
of strife and sadness.

07:59.220 --> 08:02.347
No, no, it's not.
It's a story of love.

08:02.515 --> 08:03.682
You don't have to tell it. Shh.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.850
If she doesn't
want to tell it.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.686
She will tell. This is a
table full of your loved ones.

08:08.063 --> 08:09.605
Oh. Okay.

08:10.106 --> 08:11.857
I've been held captive
by Leezar

08:11.941 --> 08:13.650
in the Tower of Disorder
since I was but a child.

08:13.735 --> 08:16.070
Never knowing love
nor human contact.

08:16.571 --> 08:17.946
But I never
gave up hope.

08:18.239 --> 08:21.950
Singing every day, praying that
someday my hero would find me.

08:22.035 --> 08:23.619
And I did.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.038
We had just
slaughtered the Cyclops.

08:26.206 --> 08:28.874
We were on our way home,
and on the wind

08:29.042 --> 08:30.834
I heard the most
beautiful song.

08:32.044 --> 08:35.422
Fascinating, really. May we
take pause for one moment.

08:36.256 --> 08:37.299
Yes, sir.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.592
Look at Courtney's
new haircut.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.385
Doesn't it make his head
look like the tip of a penis?

08:41.471 --> 08:43.304
It's hilarious.

08:43.556 --> 08:44.807
Thadeous, please.

08:44.974 --> 08:46.391
What is your problem?

08:46.476 --> 08:49.103
You, Fabious, you're
being selfish and greedy.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.105
Stealing all
the attentions.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.941
Today is not just
for you two.

08:54.025 --> 08:56.860
Today is
Thundarian's birthday.

08:57.487 --> 08:59.154
Thundarian,
is it your birthday?

08:59.239 --> 09:00.489
It's not my birthday.

09:00.657 --> 09:02.407
It's not Thundarian's
birthday, Thadeous.

09:02.492 --> 09:03.659
Enough, enough.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.203
My heart's desire,
what is this?

09:06.496 --> 09:09.414
No. That's a...
We call that a fork,

09:09.499 --> 09:11.583
and you use that
for your food.

09:11.668 --> 09:13.085
Right there.
Fucking idiot.

09:14.254 --> 09:15.671
Having spent years
in the tower

09:15.755 --> 09:19.341
has made her ignorant to some of
our customs and things in general.

09:19.676 --> 09:20.759
Why, yes, of course.

09:20.844 --> 09:21.969
If your mother
were here today,

09:22.095 --> 09:24.388
she would be a very
proud woman, Fabious.

09:24.556 --> 09:25.764
Thank you, Father.

09:25.932 --> 09:29.935
Which is why I ask your
permission to marry her at once.

09:30.854 --> 09:32.646
The glory of romance!

09:33.022 --> 09:35.023
I call upon my criers
to proclaim

09:35.108 --> 09:38.902
that tomorrow we'll see the greatest
wedding this kingdom has ever known.

09:38.987 --> 09:42.114
And tonight,
we celebrate!

09:54.419 --> 09:55.878
I don't like this.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.714
Courtney, will you make
funny faces to entertain me?

10:02.969 --> 10:04.178
No.

10:04.345 --> 10:07.514
Never triangle face. I hate
triangle face. It scares me.

10:07.682 --> 10:08.682
Apologies.

10:09.934 --> 10:11.018
Ah.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.353
Good evening,
Your Royal Highness.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.479
Julie.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.523
Hello, fucking Julie.

10:16.691 --> 10:20.319
What a wonderful,
wonderful evening, sire.

10:20.737 --> 10:23.280
Yet another
glorious achievement

10:23.364 --> 10:27.576
in the whole firmament of starring
moments for your brother Fabious.

10:27.785 --> 10:31.914
We shall remember it
for the rest of our lives.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.126
Isn't that amazing
how he can talk

10:36.211 --> 10:38.003
and suck my cock at
the same exact time?

10:38.171 --> 10:40.005
Yes, it is.
Incredible.

10:40.548 --> 10:43.300
Oh, clean yourself up.

10:43.384 --> 10:44.927
Should have closed
your eyes, Julie.

10:45.261 --> 10:48.055
I know your vulgarity
masks your pain.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.640
No, it doesn't.

10:49.724 --> 10:51.975
I was trying to remember
the last time we had

10:52.060 --> 10:54.895
one of these wonderful
evenings for you, sir.

10:55.146 --> 10:57.231
Surely there
must have been one

10:57.398 --> 11:01.568
somewhere in the history of this
kingdom, of your illustrious life.

11:01.653 --> 11:04.196
There must've
been some moment

11:04.405 --> 11:05.989
that we can
all remember.

11:06.074 --> 11:08.033
And I'm trying
to think now

11:08.743 --> 11:10.369
and there's nothing.

11:11.162 --> 11:14.456
Courtney, I think I've had
enough of this foul party.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.540
Yes, sir.

11:18.711 --> 11:20.587
Stupid Julie,
I'll show him.

11:21.756 --> 11:23.590
I am Thadeous,

11:23.758 --> 11:27.344
the greatest sword
fighting man to ever live.

11:27.512 --> 11:32.224
I will murder anyone
whoever tries to insult me

11:32.308 --> 11:34.434
or challenge me.

11:34.978 --> 11:38.188
Some balls you have, Simon,
showing yourself to me.

11:40.316 --> 11:42.359
No matter what you say,
we'll never be friends

11:42.443 --> 11:44.778
because I hate
mechanical inventions

11:44.946 --> 11:46.238
and you know this.

11:47.615 --> 11:49.741
Wipe that smile
off your face.

11:50.952 --> 11:52.536
Hey, Simon.

11:52.704 --> 11:55.872
You should swing from your hips,
Brother. You'll get more leverage.

11:55.957 --> 11:58.041
Here, let me show you.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.209
Oh, god.

11:59.294 --> 12:01.962
Put your hands there,
yeah,

12:02.130 --> 12:04.256
and swing.

12:04.424 --> 12:07.634
Gods, get off of me. I
know how to use a sword.

12:07.802 --> 12:09.636
Do you?
Yes.

12:09.804 --> 12:11.805
We'll see about that.

12:11.973 --> 12:13.724
Okay, enough. I don't
want to do swords with you.

12:13.808 --> 12:14.891
I'm doing it by myself.

12:14.976 --> 12:16.393
Defend yourself,
Brother!

12:16.477 --> 12:17.894
Stop it.
There you go.

12:17.979 --> 12:18.979
Stop.

12:19.063 --> 12:20.564
Defend yourself!

12:20.732 --> 12:22.733
Stop it.

12:24.027 --> 12:25.068
Oh, shit!

12:25.153 --> 12:26.987
You just nicked
my knuckles!

12:27.071 --> 12:29.906
Oh, you'll be all right. It's not as
if I cut your head off or anything.

12:30.158 --> 12:32.242
Why would you bring
that disgusting thing here?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.494
It's getting juices
in our water supply.

12:34.662 --> 12:36.330
It's a souvenir
of my kill.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.333
I always take one from a
foe that's tasted the cold,

12:39.417 --> 12:41.668
unrelenting steel
of my blade.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.046
Souvenir of your kill?

12:44.130 --> 12:48.008
That sounds like a rather
stupid, bloodthirsty tradition.

12:49.510 --> 12:50.886
What's your problem?

12:50.970 --> 12:52.429
Why are you
such a sourpuss?

12:52.513 --> 12:56.016
I'm not being a sourpuss. I just
didn't wanna be at that celebrations.

12:56.351 --> 12:58.560
All I want is for you to
be a part of this moment.

12:58.728 --> 13:01.271
I want you to be gay
with me and father.

13:01.356 --> 13:03.482
I don't want to be gay
with you two.

13:04.734 --> 13:05.901
I'd rather just stay
in here

13:05.985 --> 13:08.403
with my blade
and fuck things up.

13:08.696 --> 13:09.905
Why would you say that?

13:09.989 --> 13:12.491
Because, Fabious,
it's true.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.164
I'm sick and tired of everyone
sucking up on your tits

13:19.248 --> 13:21.208
because you are
to become king.

13:21.375 --> 13:24.669
All the while, no one gives
two turtle shits about me.

13:25.004 --> 13:29.424
But Thaddy, first borns
like me, we become king.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.844
Second borns, you can be
whatever you want to be.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.846
I want to be king.

13:35.765 --> 13:37.307
Maybe we can both
be king.

13:37.517 --> 13:41.019
No, I want to be
king by myself.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.063
Well, cheer up,
Brother.

13:43.147 --> 13:44.564
I have something else
that you can be.

13:45.066 --> 13:46.650
What?

13:46.734 --> 13:48.401
Best man
at my wedding.

13:48.903 --> 13:51.947
I can think of no one
else I'd want by my side

13:52.323 --> 13:54.991
as I sing my vow
passionately into her eyes.

13:55.076 --> 13:57.452
Sounds tedious
and boring.

13:57.745 --> 13:59.371
If I'm not mistaken,
it's tradition

13:59.455 --> 14:02.374
that the best man gets
to finger the bridesmaids.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.252
Really? I've never
heard of this tradition.

14:09.841 --> 14:11.341
You have a fucking deal.

14:11.425 --> 14:13.677
Oh, you're gonna
be so handsome!

14:13.761 --> 14:16.471
Who's gonna be the
most handsome best man?

14:17.056 --> 14:18.265
Probably me.

14:18.349 --> 14:21.351
Who's the prince with the
most dashing moustache?

14:21.936 --> 14:23.061
Me.

14:23.146 --> 14:25.438
Who gives
the warmest hugs?

14:25.523 --> 14:26.898
Me, of course.

14:27.525 --> 14:29.067
I love you, Thadeous.

14:30.653 --> 14:32.779
Okay, that's cool.

14:33.739 --> 14:37.075
All gather
for the royal wedding!

14:50.798 --> 14:53.466
Hello there, best man.

14:53.885 --> 14:54.885
Best man?

14:54.969 --> 14:57.888
If he wanted a best man,
he should have chosen me.

14:57.972 --> 15:00.015
How many quests have
I been on with Fabious?

15:00.099 --> 15:01.099
Countless.
Mmm.

15:01.893 --> 15:05.145
I gave my hand to save his
life on the battlefield.

15:05.229 --> 15:08.148
And yet he chooses
Thadeous as his best man.

15:08.357 --> 15:11.860
That sorry sack of shit.

15:12.028 --> 15:14.821
Such a poor excuse
for a prince.

15:14.989 --> 15:18.575
He's nothing more than a
self-entitled, rotten child!

15:18.910 --> 15:19.910
Idiot.

15:22.163 --> 15:24.039
You look beautiful.
Thank you.

15:24.207 --> 15:25.207
Belladonna...

15:25.958 --> 15:27.959
Oh, my love.

15:30.963 --> 15:34.299
Oh, Fabious, I can't wait
until the cervix is over,

15:34.383 --> 15:36.468
and to lie together
as one.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.261
No, the service.

15:38.346 --> 15:43.558
The cervix is a circular wing of
muscles that contracts or expands.

15:43.726 --> 15:45.435
It's up in your vagina.

15:45.686 --> 15:48.230
That's where my penis
will go after the wedding.

15:49.398 --> 15:51.107
Have you not
consummated your love?

15:51.192 --> 15:52.234
Not yet.

15:52.568 --> 15:54.277
Belladonna has
never been with a man

15:54.362 --> 15:57.405
so we've decided to preserve her
purity till after the wedding.

15:58.199 --> 16:00.867
She's given me this ribbon
from her fair hair.

16:00.952 --> 16:04.621
To hold on to until we can
be together in a sex-way.

16:05.539 --> 16:06.957
Yes.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.418
Enough, enough.

16:11.629 --> 16:13.296
If Thadeous wishes
to play forgetful

16:13.381 --> 16:14.881
on his brother's day
of days,

16:14.966 --> 16:16.591
then wait we shall not.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.303
I can't get married without
my brother. He's my best man.

16:20.429 --> 16:23.556
His time has passed.
Pick another best man.

16:23.641 --> 16:24.683
No.

16:24.767 --> 16:27.560
Julie, you be best man.
Here you are.

16:27.812 --> 16:28.895
Godsdammit.

16:31.065 --> 16:34.150
Oh, Brendan,
you trolls have it so easy.

16:34.485 --> 16:37.904
Out here playing recklessly
in your beautiful mud.

16:38.072 --> 16:41.408
Eating your scraps of
horse meats and crumbs.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.035
Green grass.
Green grass.

16:44.495 --> 16:47.163
And do tell,
how do you get so dirty?

16:47.623 --> 16:51.376
You just take the earth
and rub it upon your face?

16:51.836 --> 16:53.169
Your Highness,

16:54.547 --> 16:57.632
the wedding has... Hello.
The wedding has started.

16:57.717 --> 16:59.801
I do not care.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.387
I'd rather stay with
this fine gentleman.

17:02.513 --> 17:03.638
Hiding here with
my true friends.

17:03.723 --> 17:04.806
Yes.

17:04.890 --> 17:09.019
Let the whole entire wedding
wonder and worry where I am.

17:12.022 --> 17:17.152
This is the day that
I've been waiting for

17:19.070 --> 17:22.531
Sand in the kingdom

17:22.657 --> 17:25.367
Our love is born

17:26.494 --> 17:31.875
Flowing from the ocean
to the moons

17:34.045 --> 17:39.090
Your heart now I hold

17:41.886 --> 17:47.265
You have a beauty
I can't ignore

17:48.934 --> 17:54.105
Bastion of all I do adore

17:56.233 --> 17:59.694
Giving this moment

17:59.904 --> 18:03.531
Our love that's true

18:04.492 --> 18:09.537
Our hearts now are one

18:15.044 --> 18:16.836
Bravo!

18:17.421 --> 18:20.799
Bravo!

18:20.883 --> 18:23.385
Reveal yourself, stranger.
Are you lost?

18:23.719 --> 18:27.931
A thousand pardons. I mean not to
intrude on such a joyous occasion.

18:28.891 --> 18:32.352
However, today I just
could not help myself.

18:32.603 --> 18:33.686
Leezar!

18:33.771 --> 18:35.814
You're not
welcome here, devil!

18:39.318 --> 18:41.361
If you come in peace,
say so,

18:41.445 --> 18:43.696
otherwise prepare
to meet your doom.

18:43.781 --> 18:45.698
Oh, brave Fabious.

18:45.950 --> 18:49.953
You murdered my Cyclops. But I
have other perils in store for you.

18:50.704 --> 18:53.415
Ones that are beyond the
bounds of your imagination.

18:53.582 --> 18:54.958
One, in particular,

18:55.126 --> 18:56.876
involving an ancient
prophecy destined

18:56.961 --> 18:59.546
to be fulfilled by
a powerful warlock,

18:59.630 --> 19:00.713
me.

19:01.006 --> 19:04.384
And, of course, a very beautiful
virgin that looks just like

19:06.804 --> 19:07.804
Her.

19:08.097 --> 19:11.850
I was keeping that one
for something very special.

19:12.017 --> 19:15.603
And I dare say it was rude
of you to steal her from me.

19:15.771 --> 19:17.063
Now I'm here
to get her back.

19:17.314 --> 19:19.858
And just how do you
plan on doing that?

19:19.984 --> 19:21.067
Magic,

19:22.611 --> 19:23.736
Motherfucker.

19:23.904 --> 19:24.946
Not a moment more.

19:25.030 --> 19:26.990
Knights, to arms!
Take him!

19:30.870 --> 19:33.997
Do you honestly think your
band of worms can stop me?

19:38.544 --> 19:41.087
Arise therefore,
my mothers!

19:49.722 --> 19:50.722
Watch out!

20:05.696 --> 20:06.905
Come with me.

20:08.282 --> 20:09.782
Leezar!

20:20.461 --> 20:23.046
I shall not go back
to that dreadful tower!

20:23.130 --> 20:24.214
Look into my eyes!

20:24.590 --> 20:27.258
You will learn to love
me! Do you understand?

20:32.181 --> 20:33.389
Come on.

20:43.567 --> 20:45.401
Impossible.

20:59.583 --> 21:01.626
Farewell,
Kingdom of Mourne.

21:01.710 --> 21:05.338
As always,
it has been my pleasure.

21:23.274 --> 21:24.732
I thought
it was from riding sheep,

21:24.817 --> 21:26.526
but it turns out just
to be an ear infection.

21:27.778 --> 21:28.778
You fucker!

21:30.573 --> 21:31.656
Good times.

21:31.740 --> 21:33.408
No one get up.
I'm very tired.

21:33.492 --> 21:35.076
I'm going straight
to my bed chambers.

21:35.411 --> 21:37.579
Brother,
thank god you're alive.

21:37.746 --> 21:40.248
When you didn't show up for
the wedding, I feared the worst.

21:40.374 --> 21:41.541
Why are you crying?

21:41.750 --> 21:43.418
Leezar has taken my love.

21:43.586 --> 21:44.752
What?
Yes.

21:44.878 --> 21:48.256
So, your brother is about to
embark on yet another quest.

21:48.591 --> 21:50.174
This time to
rescue Belladonna

21:50.259 --> 21:52.302
and rid the land of
that loathsome wretch

21:52.386 --> 21:53.511
once and for all.

21:53.637 --> 21:55.680
Wow, how noble of him.

21:56.098 --> 21:59.392
Well, it was nice to see you,
as short as the visit was.

21:59.476 --> 22:03.104
I look forward to hearing about
it. Good luck and good bye.

22:03.355 --> 22:06.274
Thadeous, this is
Fabious' 28th quest.

22:06.942 --> 22:08.484
How many have
you been on?

22:08.569 --> 22:11.195
Courtney, how many
quests have I completed?

22:11.280 --> 22:12.447
Uh...

22:12.781 --> 22:15.033
The answer is none.

22:15.117 --> 22:17.744
It is finally time
for you to become a man.

22:17.828 --> 22:20.788
You must journey with your
brother to rescue his bride.

22:20.998 --> 22:22.707
Father,
you can't be serious.

22:22.791 --> 22:24.000
If you want me to
go on to a quest,

22:24.084 --> 22:25.460
then let's start
with something easy,

22:25.544 --> 22:28.796
like boiling a chicken or
beating off in front of a Pegasus.

22:28.881 --> 22:30.423
Elementary things.

22:30.674 --> 22:34.636
Look around you at the harm
that has befallen this castle!

22:37.097 --> 22:39.140
This quest is
your last chance

22:39.224 --> 22:41.684
to prove to me
and the kingdom

22:41.769 --> 22:44.854
that you are a man worthy
to bear the family crest,

22:44.938 --> 22:48.107
and to show that at your
core, you are not rotten,

22:48.609 --> 22:51.903
but you are brave,
and honorable, and noble.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.906
All the qualities
expected of a prince.

22:54.990 --> 22:56.282
The choice is yours.

22:56.617 --> 22:59.202
Either journey with your
brother and the Knights Elite,

22:59.286 --> 23:02.121
or you can face banishment
from the kingdom.

23:02.915 --> 23:03.998
Shit.

23:29.983 --> 23:31.317
You see, Courtney,

23:31.402 --> 23:34.570
I alone understand how to
properly prepare for a quest.

23:34.822 --> 23:38.825
Masculine garments, proper,
good collie to smoke upon.

23:38.992 --> 23:40.660
How is Steven doing?

23:40.828 --> 23:42.662
He looks like
he's stoned, sir.

23:42.830 --> 23:44.122
Fabious has Simon,

23:44.206 --> 23:47.750
and now I have Steven, a far
superior creature companion.

23:47.835 --> 23:49.168
Wouldn't you agree?

23:49.336 --> 23:52.004
He will fare very well,
indeed, I'm sure, Your Highness.

23:52.089 --> 23:54.924
I do hope this adventure is
not too stressful or boring.

23:55.008 --> 23:59.345
Either way I intend to get properly
fucked up if no one disagrees.

24:16.363 --> 24:19.240
Belladonna, wake up.
Wake up.

24:19.408 --> 24:21.451
Who is that?
Where am I?

24:21.535 --> 24:23.411
'Tis I, Fabious.
Your love.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.080
Fabious?

24:26.248 --> 24:27.999
You're still
in Leezar's lair.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.793
But fear not,
I'm here to rescue you.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.795
Fabious,
it's really you.

24:32.880 --> 24:34.922
I knew you'd come
to find me.

24:41.180 --> 24:45.057
I can't do this. I can't
do it. It's so mean.

24:46.059 --> 24:49.896
You should've seen the
look on your face. It's me!

24:50.606 --> 24:52.190
You're still a prisoner.

24:52.357 --> 24:55.026
I've seen a beautiful
world beyond this prison,

24:55.110 --> 24:57.361
and I count the hours
till I escape.

24:57.613 --> 24:59.489
I wouldn't be
so sure of that.

24:59.573 --> 25:03.743
Lookie there. The twin moons
drawing slowly together.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.537
Time moving them closer.

25:06.705 --> 25:10.583
Just as time moves you
and I closer together.

25:10.876 --> 25:14.086
And when the two moons
unite, so shall we.

25:14.421 --> 25:17.965
Perhaps, keeping you in this
tower has left you ignorant.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.510
You're so easily deceived.

25:20.761 --> 25:24.764
For example, I have heard
that your Prince Fabious

25:24.932 --> 25:28.059
has made his bed recklessly
with many maidens.

25:30.145 --> 25:34.857
And I heard that he has fungi
on his genitalia as a result.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.443
Also, he organizes orgies

25:37.778 --> 25:40.530
with wenches and
barbarians alike

25:40.614 --> 25:45.034
and he takes sperm on him
and gives it to women freely.

25:45.452 --> 25:47.411
Spilling his seed
willy-nilly

25:47.579 --> 25:50.790
as he makes his way
through that orgy.

25:50.999 --> 25:53.042
I don't believe you.

25:53.126 --> 25:57.046
He is not the dashing young
man you believe him to be.

25:57.339 --> 25:58.339
So

26:00.133 --> 26:04.095
these are the harsh realities
of the outside world.

26:06.014 --> 26:07.682
Welcome home.

26:10.519 --> 26:12.854
Halt! Steady.

26:16.400 --> 26:17.400
Oh.

26:17.526 --> 26:19.610
Sorry to disturb
you two love birds

26:19.778 --> 26:22.572
but we've arrived at the
home of the Wize Wizard.

26:22.739 --> 26:24.198
Who the hell is
the Wize Wizard?

26:24.491 --> 26:26.284
He's an ancient seer
who helps many

26:26.368 --> 26:28.160
on their quest
with added insight.

26:28.245 --> 26:31.247
Great. Well, let
me know how it goes.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.374
Leave him in
his carriage, Fabious.

26:33.458 --> 26:35.710
You and I will seek counsel
with the Wize Wizard.

26:35.794 --> 26:36.836
No.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.214
Come, Brother. This is the
first stop on your first quest.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.842
We shall go together.

26:54.688 --> 26:55.730
Brother,

26:55.898 --> 26:57.523
you look ravishing
in that armor,

26:57.608 --> 26:59.817
but I don't think
you'll need it.

26:59.943 --> 27:02.820
The Wize Wizard is a
peaceful, little old man.

27:03.655 --> 27:05.740
I'm wearing it.
You're just being jealous.

27:05.908 --> 27:06.949
Shit!

27:07.034 --> 27:08.034
Thadeous!

27:09.578 --> 27:11.203
Fuck.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.374
Hello? Anyone home?

27:18.086 --> 27:21.172
Looks as if someone is
cultivating glorious herbs in here.

27:21.256 --> 27:23.215
Hey, Wize Wizard,
is that you over there?

27:23.508 --> 27:27.053
Who dares enter my den?

27:27.721 --> 27:31.349
It is I, Prince Fabious and
my brother, Prince Thadeous.

27:31.516 --> 27:33.392
We come
to seek counsel.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.937
Come, come.
Give me kisses.

27:44.404 --> 27:46.197
Kiss him.

27:46.281 --> 27:47.281
Fuck, no.

27:47.366 --> 27:48.366
Pretty please.

27:48.450 --> 27:49.742
Kiss it on the mouth.

27:50.243 --> 27:52.244
For the quest.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.664
I do it
every time I come.

27:57.292 --> 28:00.419
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

28:03.590 --> 28:05.049
Oh, god.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.676
Sit, sit.

28:06.760 --> 28:07.843
Sit.

28:07.928 --> 28:11.931
Fabious has been coming
here since he was a boy.

28:12.099 --> 28:14.183
You did this when
you were a child.

28:14.267 --> 28:15.351
Yes!

28:15.602 --> 28:17.269
We had great times,
didn't we?

28:17.604 --> 28:19.605
Yes, yes, we did.

28:20.774 --> 28:22.566
You would kiss him?

28:22.651 --> 28:24.026
Mmm-hmm.

28:24.111 --> 28:26.946
Yeah, sometimes we
would do other things.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.781
Like what?

28:28.949 --> 28:32.118
When I was younger, we'd take our
shirts off and jump on the bed.

28:32.202 --> 28:34.787
Playful secrets.

28:35.622 --> 28:36.622
Don't tell father.

28:36.707 --> 28:37.748
Hmm.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.167
Breathe deeply
of these herbs

28:40.252 --> 28:42.044
and share a vision
with me.

28:42.129 --> 28:43.212
Of course.

28:48.552 --> 28:51.262
Yes. Allow me
to puff as well.

28:51.346 --> 28:52.555
Hmm.

28:55.475 --> 28:58.269
Those are
some powerful herbs.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.479
Giving me dark visions.

29:00.647 --> 29:02.189
Shall we pack
this again?

29:02.274 --> 29:04.775
I'm not getting visions. I'm
not sure if it's working, Wizard.

29:05.986 --> 29:08.487
Visions. Visions.

29:08.613 --> 29:10.906
Thadeous, are you
seeing what I'm seeing?

29:11.074 --> 29:12.283
You making
a fool yourself.

29:12.367 --> 29:13.868
Handle your shit,
Fabious, please.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.119
No, I can't.

29:16.371 --> 29:18.706
Please, interpret
these visions, Wizard.

29:18.957 --> 29:22.043
Prophecies foretell
of an evil wizard

29:22.169 --> 29:24.795
laying his seed
inside a virgin

29:24.880 --> 29:27.173
under the eclipse
of the two moons.

29:27.507 --> 29:30.051
What? What evil
prophecy is this?

29:30.135 --> 29:31.594
The child
she would spawn

29:31.678 --> 29:34.221
is said to be
a dragon most powerful.

29:34.514 --> 29:38.601
Ew. Leezar wants to make love
to Belladonna to create a dragon?

29:38.685 --> 29:40.811
That's fucking disgusting.

29:40.896 --> 29:42.229
I cannot
let this happen.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.606
When is this eclipse?

29:43.690 --> 29:45.357
In five nights' time,

29:45.692 --> 29:49.737
but you will need an enchanted
blade to do this warlock in.

29:49.821 --> 29:52.406
A blade made
of unicorn horn.

29:52.741 --> 29:55.618
Say where I can find such a
sword and it shall be mine.

29:55.702 --> 29:59.580
It rests in the depths of the
most perilous hidden labyrinth.

29:59.915 --> 30:02.374
Just beyond
Muldiss Darton.

30:02.542 --> 30:03.667
Muldiss Darton.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.337
Well, what is
Muldiss Darton?

30:06.505 --> 30:08.172
It's a place of legend.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.640
Oh. Powerful magic.

30:17.766 --> 30:20.476
This crooked compass
will catch the light

30:20.560 --> 30:23.729
and point the way to
the labyrinth's location.

30:23.897 --> 30:25.189
Be warned,

30:25.273 --> 30:29.235
they say the walls of this
maze drive men to madness.

30:29.402 --> 30:31.570
But if you can
find your way,

30:31.655 --> 30:33.948
the blade will be yours.

30:35.075 --> 30:36.992
Thank you,
Wize Wizard.

30:37.077 --> 30:40.329
Not so fast. First you
must answer a riddle.

30:40.622 --> 30:45.584
What journey be long and
twisted and sensitive at hand?

30:45.752 --> 30:50.548
To what end must man go to
discover the depths of his ecstasy?

30:51.091 --> 30:53.384
Think hard,
strong warriors.

30:54.261 --> 30:55.678
Fuck, I know this.

30:55.762 --> 30:56.804
Oh.

30:56.888 --> 30:57.930
I've got it!

30:58.431 --> 31:03.144
You want us to twist what is
long with our sensitive hands.

31:03.436 --> 31:05.104
He wants us
to jerk him off.

31:05.355 --> 31:07.898
Just punch the tip
and twist it.

31:07.983 --> 31:10.985
Yes, but we are
not going to do that.

31:11.653 --> 31:14.738
If it's for the quest, we
will do what needs to be done.

31:16.658 --> 31:20.035
I'll work the tip,
you tickle his balls.

31:26.668 --> 31:27.668
Yuck!

31:28.253 --> 31:29.253
Pervert.

31:29.337 --> 31:30.462
Did you get
any information?

31:30.630 --> 31:32.673
Let's just make camp.

31:32.757 --> 31:35.718
Sick. This quest sucks.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.137
It used to be you
that joined him.

31:38.221 --> 31:39.388
Yes.

31:41.349 --> 31:44.351
Don't worry.
All will be well.

31:48.815 --> 31:49.899
Ha!

31:53.653 --> 31:56.196
Attentions please,
warriors.

31:56.364 --> 31:58.032
I propose a toast.

31:58.199 --> 32:00.826
Let us drink till
thine asses are drunk.

32:00.994 --> 32:02.912
Brother,
we do not celebrate

32:02.996 --> 32:04.788
until we complete
the quest at hand.

32:04.873 --> 32:06.498
It is the code of
the Knights Elite.

32:06.583 --> 32:09.835
What of my code
where we drink like men?

32:09.920 --> 32:11.128
Thadeous,
we have some traditions

32:11.212 --> 32:12.922
of our own out here
on the road.

32:13.882 --> 32:16.800
Manious, prepare the
warrior's tidings, if you will.

32:16.968 --> 32:21.221
If it is the first night
of your first quest, well...

32:26.561 --> 32:27.561
Here it comes.

32:28.897 --> 32:30.397
Disgusting.

32:32.359 --> 32:34.318
Feast upon
the heart of the beast.

32:34.402 --> 32:36.028
No, thank you,
I'm not hungry.

32:36.112 --> 32:38.530
It is a tradition
among men.

32:38.865 --> 32:40.699
Eat it.
Eat it.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.952
Eat it.
Eat it.

32:43.036 --> 32:46.747
Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!

33:03.723 --> 33:05.641
You fuckers!
That's not funny!

33:05.892 --> 33:07.351
You're not supposed
to eat it.

33:07.560 --> 33:08.727
You all were chanting.

33:08.812 --> 33:11.647
Maybe there's some donkey
cock in your carriage!

33:11.856 --> 33:14.274
Fuck you, Boremont!
Manious, fuck you!

33:14.401 --> 33:15.609
I hate all of you.

33:15.694 --> 33:17.069
Thadeous!

33:17.445 --> 33:18.612
Come back.

33:19.114 --> 33:21.281
Thadeous, come here.

33:29.749 --> 33:31.000
Ah.

33:48.601 --> 33:49.935
Dark master,

33:50.103 --> 33:53.063
it is I, Julie.

33:54.274 --> 33:56.233
We have crossed
the hazel meadow,

33:56.401 --> 33:59.653
and are now taking rest
at the Cliffs of Kuneman.

33:59.821 --> 34:03.115
Now that the Princes of Mourne
have left their stronghold

34:03.283 --> 34:05.576
their vulnerabilities
are in your hands.

34:05.744 --> 34:06.910
My hands.

34:06.995 --> 34:08.661
Bring Prince Fabious
to me alive.

34:08.913 --> 34:11.665
I would like him to witness
as I impregnate his love.

34:11.833 --> 34:13.000
Impregnate.

34:13.126 --> 34:14.585
As for Thadeous
and his boy,

34:14.668 --> 34:18.255
toss them from the Cliffs
of Kuneman. They're useless.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.675
Fart.

34:22.594 --> 34:24.553
Knock, knock.
May I come in?

34:24.721 --> 34:27.431
No, leave me alone.
Get out of here.

34:27.514 --> 34:31.810
Thadeous, you must
calm down. It's over.

34:32.020 --> 34:34.521
You ate the heart,
you passed the initiation.

34:34.606 --> 34:35.606
Passed?

34:35.690 --> 34:37.690
You made me look stupid in
front of all your friends.

34:37.859 --> 34:40.402
And don't think I'm not telling
father because I'm going to.

34:40.487 --> 34:43.781
Thadeous, we were just having
some fun, and it was perfect.

34:43.947 --> 34:46.199
Now they know you're
not to be fucked with.

34:46.367 --> 34:48.368
Excuse me, sir,
sorry for the intrusion.

34:48.453 --> 34:50.746
I have just witnessed
a most disturbing incident.

34:50.914 --> 34:52.748
There must be
a misunderstanding.

34:52.831 --> 34:54.666
Julie is my most
trusted confidant.

34:54.751 --> 34:56.001
Julie is an idiot.

34:56.085 --> 34:57.503
No, he's not.
He's a gentleman.

34:57.587 --> 34:59.171
Julie is what,
Your Highness?

34:59.380 --> 35:00.798
I'm not sure, Julie.

35:00.882 --> 35:03.050
Courtney said he saw
some suspicious behavior.

35:03.301 --> 35:07.429
You, I saw you
talking with Leezar.

35:09.808 --> 35:13.310
How dare you watch me
in my private moments.

35:18.983 --> 35:20.442
He's stolen my vision.

35:20.693 --> 35:21.735
Get him, Courtney!

35:23.988 --> 35:24.988
Come here!

35:28.076 --> 35:29.159
You old beast.

35:29.869 --> 35:31.703
Courtney, just restrain
him with all your might.

35:31.788 --> 35:33.330
No, slay him!

35:33.623 --> 35:34.665
Murder him!

35:34.791 --> 35:36.083
Die of me.

35:40.463 --> 35:41.797
What?

35:41.965 --> 35:44.466
Don't move,
you're surrounded.

35:44.801 --> 35:45.926
Ew!

35:46.136 --> 35:47.427
Julie has no dick!

35:47.512 --> 35:48.595
Ew.

35:48.680 --> 35:49.763
Boremont!

35:49.931 --> 35:51.056
Help!

35:53.560 --> 35:54.560
Knights!

35:54.644 --> 35:56.145
A turncoat has
been discovered!

35:56.312 --> 35:57.813
Prince Fabious,
what is wrong?

35:57.981 --> 35:59.356
Boremont, seize Julie,

35:59.440 --> 36:00.899
I'm afraid
he's betrayed us!

36:00.984 --> 36:03.110
That thing is
a dickless traitor!

36:03.361 --> 36:04.862
A traitor, you say.
Yes.

36:05.029 --> 36:07.573
I saw him seeking counsel
with Leezar.

36:07.740 --> 36:10.409
Counsel? With Leezar?

36:11.202 --> 36:13.412
Well, if what
they say is true,

36:13.496 --> 36:16.290
then, Julie, I have but
one question for you.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.834
What were
our master's orders?

36:18.918 --> 36:20.002
What?

36:20.086 --> 36:21.295
His orders
were simple.

36:21.838 --> 36:24.423
Capture Fabious
and kill the rest.

36:24.591 --> 36:27.426
Boremont,
how could you?

36:27.510 --> 36:29.052
What about the code
of the Knights Elite?

36:29.137 --> 36:30.179
Code?

36:30.471 --> 36:32.389
Upon your choice of best
man for your wedding,

36:32.473 --> 36:34.766
your "code"
became clear to me.

36:34.851 --> 36:36.685
You hurt my feelings.

36:37.103 --> 36:38.937
Now I shall hurt yours.

36:40.398 --> 36:41.857
Kill them all!

36:42.025 --> 36:43.650
Look out!

36:50.617 --> 36:51.617
To the carriage!

36:51.701 --> 36:53.410
Your friends tried
to slay us.

36:53.494 --> 36:56.121
Those bastards!
Get in!

37:01.419 --> 37:02.544
After them!

37:02.629 --> 37:03.629
Okay, go!

37:13.932 --> 37:15.474
We've got company!

37:15.642 --> 37:16.850
Ready yourselves!

37:16.935 --> 37:18.185
These men are fierce!

37:24.317 --> 37:25.442
Oh, gods!

37:49.592 --> 37:51.093
Under the cart you go!

37:55.265 --> 37:57.182
Fucking sword!
Stab him!

37:57.350 --> 37:58.600
Stab him!

38:04.732 --> 38:06.525
You cut his hair off!

38:16.202 --> 38:17.327
Oh!

38:17.412 --> 38:18.704
Fabious, he's coming!

38:18.871 --> 38:20.539
I know, get up here!

38:27.171 --> 38:28.171
Come on!

38:31.801 --> 38:32.884
Now what?

38:33.136 --> 38:35.846
I have a plan. We jump on
the horses and ride away.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.098
But the horses,
they're moving.

38:38.266 --> 38:40.183
I know. I know.

38:42.687 --> 38:44.187
Oh, shit!

38:48.484 --> 38:49.526
Come on!

38:49.610 --> 38:50.861
What? Want me, as well?

38:51.029 --> 38:52.112
Now!

38:56.326 --> 38:57.868
Face me, you traitor.

39:23.227 --> 39:24.269
Look!

39:24.354 --> 39:25.479
Oh, shit!

39:43.122 --> 39:44.331
We did it!

39:48.169 --> 39:49.461
Ka-boom!

39:49.629 --> 39:51.046
Yes!

39:54.133 --> 39:55.967
If I could have
everyone's attention.

39:56.511 --> 39:59.054
I'd like to say
a few words, if I may.

39:59.222 --> 40:01.556
I have prepared
this feast

40:01.724 --> 40:04.643
in honor and appreciation
of Belladonna.

40:04.811 --> 40:07.062
Seems like it
was only yesterday

40:07.146 --> 40:10.607
that we used sorcery to burn
your village to the ground,

40:11.150 --> 40:12.442
come in and snatch you.

40:12.860 --> 40:14.027
But I remember
looking at you

40:14.112 --> 40:15.529
all those years ago
and thinking,

40:15.905 --> 40:18.407
"Wow, that's a baby. "

40:18.574 --> 40:21.535
"And that's the baby that someday
I will have to have sex with. "

40:21.702 --> 40:23.245
Now, look at me.

40:23.413 --> 40:25.497
A 19-year-old boy,
almost a man,

40:26.707 --> 40:28.250
Still a virgin.

40:28.418 --> 40:29.543
To the fuckening!

40:29.710 --> 40:31.128
Yes, to the fuckening!

40:31.504 --> 40:35.590
Leezar, what is this rubbish
you have set before us?

40:35.758 --> 40:38.427
It's such a funny
choice for a feast.

40:38.594 --> 40:40.178
I'm just a little
overwhelmed right now.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.597
Dealing with her and you
and the fucking prophecy.

40:42.765 --> 40:43.974
I mean, we could
all just relax...

40:44.058 --> 40:45.267
Master.

40:45.393 --> 40:47.060
What do you want, Julie?

40:47.311 --> 40:49.604
Regrettably, the Princes
of Mourne have escaped.

40:49.772 --> 40:52.107
You should've killed them at the
wedding when you had the chance.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.775
Fabious is of
no purpose to us.

40:53.860 --> 40:54.985
Silence!

40:55.069 --> 40:58.071
His purpose is to destroy
you and your evil ways.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.449
Would you shut up,
or I will love you less.

41:00.533 --> 41:02.409
Are those fish fingers
you're eating?

41:02.577 --> 41:05.287
No more questions!
Now find them!

41:08.207 --> 41:11.209
Shit! Fabious, the
horses! They're escaping.

41:11.377 --> 41:14.796
Yes, it's a distraction
to lead them off our trail.

41:14.964 --> 41:17.090
And what are we to do now?
Walk all the way home?

41:17.258 --> 41:19.759
Home? We're not going home.

41:19.844 --> 41:20.844
Just because
the knights betrayed us

41:20.928 --> 41:22.971
does not mean we
give up on the quest.

41:23.139 --> 41:25.265
Together we can still
accomplish what needs to be done.

41:25.433 --> 41:27.434
How? We're lost,
I'm hungry.

41:27.518 --> 41:29.769
This stump, it's putting
my asshole to sleep.

41:29.854 --> 41:32.564
Thadeous, your feet are
bare. Put your boots on.

41:32.940 --> 41:35.066
They're filthy, I'm
having them exfoliated.

41:35.151 --> 41:36.735
No time for exfoliation.

41:38.738 --> 41:40.280
The compass points north.

41:40.448 --> 41:42.073
We shall
follow it still.

41:42.450 --> 41:45.160
I will not give up till
Belladonna is safe in mine arms.

41:45.328 --> 41:46.828
Oh, god.

41:49.624 --> 41:51.583
Simon!
Where have you been?

41:51.751 --> 41:52.959
Shit.

41:53.044 --> 41:54.211
What?

41:54.337 --> 41:56.755
I left goddamn Steven
back at camp.

41:57.131 --> 41:58.340
Who's Steven?

41:58.507 --> 42:00.425
He's my loyal
animal companion.

42:00.593 --> 42:03.929
And he means just as much
to me as Simon means to you.

42:04.096 --> 42:06.598
But I guess I'll
never see him again.

42:06.766 --> 42:09.267
Very well.
I understand that bond.

42:09.477 --> 42:13.563
Let us return to camp, face
the traitors and rescue Steven.

42:13.689 --> 42:15.440
No, fuck it.
It's over.

42:15.650 --> 42:18.485
But, perhaps, since my animal
companion is no longer here,

42:18.569 --> 42:20.904
it's only fair that we
get rid of yours as well.

42:22.907 --> 42:25.158
No, that would serve
no purpose, Brother.

42:25.326 --> 42:27.285
That would be like me asking
you to get rid of Courtney

42:27.370 --> 42:29.120
just because Julie
is no longer with us.

42:29.330 --> 42:31.539
I will drown Courtney in the
shallow fucking pond right now

42:31.624 --> 42:32.749
if that means
fair is fair.

42:32.833 --> 42:34.334
I don't like
that idea, sir.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.378
No, Simon can help us.

42:36.462 --> 42:37.462
Simon,

42:37.797 --> 42:40.131
you must take this
message to father.

42:40.216 --> 42:42.759
Tell him that the
Knights Elite betrayed us

42:42.843 --> 42:46.304
and he must send an army across
the valley to Muldiss Darton

42:46.472 --> 42:48.807
and help us retrieve
the Blade of Unicorn.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.058
Hurry, Simon!

42:50.142 --> 42:53.228
Fly to Mourne and deliver
these desperate words.

42:53.479 --> 42:56.439
Fly!

43:01.654 --> 43:04.614
Come on, Manious, you've been
sniffing dirt all morning.

43:04.699 --> 43:07.492
We would not be in
this position, Julie,

43:07.576 --> 43:10.412
if you wouldn't have gotten
caught communicating with Leezar.

43:10.538 --> 43:12.664
And if you ladies
were proper assassins,

43:12.748 --> 43:16.167
you'd have cut them down back
there as the Dark Lord commanded.

43:17.628 --> 43:19.337
Manious,
what do you see?

43:19.588 --> 43:22.257
They stepped
towards the sun here.

43:22.425 --> 43:25.677
This blade of grass,
one of them pissed on it.

43:26.012 --> 43:30.056
And then they moved, very
quickly, mind, towards...

43:30.808 --> 43:31.850
There!

43:33.728 --> 43:35.186
That's
Marteetee's land.

43:35.354 --> 43:36.354
What?

43:36.522 --> 43:39.274
Our mission may be completed
sooner than I expected.

43:42.528 --> 43:45.196
If I may be so bold,
Your Highness,

43:45.281 --> 43:48.074
what is the meaning of
that ribbon that you hold?

43:48.367 --> 43:49.909
This?

43:50.077 --> 43:51.953
It's a gift
from Belladonna.

43:52.038 --> 43:54.205
A symbol
of her virgin purity.

43:54.373 --> 43:56.750
I hold it
and savor it.

43:56.876 --> 44:00.003
You do that instead
of have sex with her?

44:00.171 --> 44:02.380
Belladonna is unlike any
maiden in the kingdom.

44:02.465 --> 44:04.299
She behaves
without judgment,

44:04.383 --> 44:05.925
defies expectation.

44:06.260 --> 44:07.886
When I first
heard her voice

44:07.970 --> 44:09.846
a tear came to my eye,

44:09.930 --> 44:11.639
and that tear
turned to ice,

44:11.724 --> 44:13.683
and I kept
that frozen tear

44:13.768 --> 44:16.269
far from my heart
that burns with passion.

44:17.229 --> 44:18.730
If she had a wound,

44:18.898 --> 44:20.899
I would kiss it.

44:20.983 --> 44:23.276
If she had a splinter,

44:23.361 --> 44:26.905
I would pull it from
her flesh with mine lips.

44:27.073 --> 44:32.243
Just say we are too late and
Leezar has had his way with her,

44:32.495 --> 44:36.081
would you still be
able to be with her?

44:37.249 --> 44:38.750
I don't want to
think about that.

44:38.918 --> 44:40.835
But just say that
we were moments late,

44:40.920 --> 44:44.422
and he was able
to get her cookies.

44:44.673 --> 44:45.757
Shut up.

44:45.841 --> 44:49.803
Yes, I know, but what if he butt-fucked
her? Would you still like her?

44:49.887 --> 44:51.429
Do I have to
write you a poem?

44:51.639 --> 44:54.140
There's never been
a love so true as ours.

44:55.267 --> 44:56.768
That's pure love.

44:56.936 --> 44:58.269
Yes, it is.

44:58.396 --> 44:59.854
No, that's pure love.

45:00.106 --> 45:02.023
There's a naked woman
standing behind you.

45:03.734 --> 45:05.860
Who is that?

45:06.153 --> 45:08.071
Is she looking at us?

45:08.197 --> 45:09.906
Who is it? Is it him?
Are you looking to him?

45:10.116 --> 45:12.075
Is it Courtney?
Is it to me?

45:12.284 --> 45:13.535
It's Courtney.
I think it's to me.

45:14.286 --> 45:17.580
I believe she is
taking her trousers off.

45:17.832 --> 45:20.917
Right, I will
return momentarily.

45:21.001 --> 45:22.127
No.

45:22.211 --> 45:23.420
Thadeous,
it might be a trap.

45:24.046 --> 45:28.174
The only thing those tits
will trap is my warm spray.

45:28.342 --> 45:30.427
Have fun
rubbing your ribbon.

45:30.970 --> 45:32.095
Disgusting.

45:32.888 --> 45:34.347
Come back here, you.

45:36.642 --> 45:39.477
I'm beginning to think he
doesn't care about this quest.

45:39.645 --> 45:41.813
What could possibly
make you think that, sir?

45:41.897 --> 45:42.897
Oh, shit!

45:43.149 --> 45:45.400
Oh, shit! It's a
trap. A booby trap.

45:45.568 --> 45:46.568
Oh, god!

45:46.735 --> 45:48.194
It was a trap.

45:48.362 --> 45:49.863
White people,
I knew it!

45:50.030 --> 45:51.072
White people?

45:51.198 --> 45:52.907
Are they nice or are
they mean? They're mean!

45:52.992 --> 45:54.284
They're the meanest!

45:54.618 --> 45:55.660
What do we do?

45:55.744 --> 45:57.579
I don't know. It is against
code to strike a woman.

45:57.663 --> 45:58.788
I'm sick of
your silly codes.

45:58.873 --> 46:00.165
Punch these ladies
in the face!

46:10.092 --> 46:11.926
Sire, where are they taking us?

46:12.094 --> 46:14.762
I don't know.
Stay close!

46:47.087 --> 46:48.171
Marteetee.

46:48.255 --> 46:49.297
Mart-who?

46:49.381 --> 46:51.633
Silence!

46:52.134 --> 46:54.969
Good day,
my little bees

46:55.137 --> 46:59.057
and welcome to my
most special of events.

46:59.558 --> 47:02.101
We have a wonderful treat

47:02.269 --> 47:06.397
as you get to witness
a sea of babbling men

47:06.482 --> 47:08.399
behold their fates.

47:10.319 --> 47:13.655
Enter, Dastardly!

47:28.629 --> 47:30.171
Bloodthirsty creatures.

47:37.972 --> 47:39.097
Oh!

47:44.353 --> 47:47.855
Brother, if I die, you must
promise me to continue our quest.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.566
Ooh!

47:58.450 --> 47:59.951
Him.
No!

48:00.119 --> 48:01.160
Kill him first!

48:01.245 --> 48:02.245
Stay away!

48:05.291 --> 48:06.457
Take the knife.

48:06.542 --> 48:07.667
Why?

48:07.876 --> 48:09.252
Watch this.

48:25.477 --> 48:26.477
Oh!
Yes!

48:26.645 --> 48:28.271
No!

48:29.481 --> 48:31.190
Face! Yes!

48:33.110 --> 48:34.277
Huh?

48:39.158 --> 48:41.826
We've bested
your finest warrior.

48:41.994 --> 48:44.078
Now grant us our freedom!

48:44.246 --> 48:45.288
Yeah!

48:45.372 --> 48:48.374
Bring Marteetee
his cauldron!

48:51.045 --> 48:52.837
What is the cauldron?

48:59.845 --> 49:02.263
Are my bees ready

49:02.348 --> 49:05.475
for the grand finale?

49:13.067 --> 49:15.735
Yes, my pet!

49:15.861 --> 49:18.029
Come forth

49:18.322 --> 49:22.867
and show thy bulbous!

49:31.710 --> 49:33.002
Oh, shit!

49:49.728 --> 49:50.728
Oh, gods!

49:56.777 --> 49:57.985
Over here!

50:00.072 --> 50:01.864
Hey, over here!

50:02.241 --> 50:03.491
Over here!

50:03.867 --> 50:05.368
Bring your fight to me!

50:11.083 --> 50:12.166
Shit!

50:28.934 --> 50:30.059
Thadeous!

50:30.144 --> 50:31.185
Shit!

50:31.270 --> 50:32.395
Sir!

50:32.479 --> 50:34.689
I've been bitten!
I can't move my leg.

50:34.773 --> 50:35.940
You've got to
suck out the venom.

50:36.108 --> 50:37.400
I don't want to suck it!
You suck it!

50:37.526 --> 50:38.860
I can't suck
my own venom!

50:38.944 --> 50:40.069
Yes, you can.
I'll help you!

50:40.237 --> 50:42.280
Suck it!
Suck your venom.

50:42.406 --> 50:43.865
I can't reach it
with my mouth!

50:43.949 --> 50:44.991
Courtney,
suck the venom!

50:45.075 --> 50:46.617
I've never sucked...
Suck it!

50:47.202 --> 50:51.456
And who have we here?

50:51.665 --> 50:54.292
A sprightly
little warrior you are.

50:54.501 --> 50:56.586
Suck it!
Right there! Suck it!

50:56.670 --> 51:00.673
I will make nice
when I enter you!

51:01.800 --> 51:03.384
It's coming!
It's coming!

51:05.179 --> 51:06.387
Courtney
spit the load!

51:06.555 --> 51:08.014
Don't swallow the venom!
Spit it!

51:10.726 --> 51:12.602
Come on! Come on!

51:24.239 --> 51:25.698
Kill it!
Fuck it up!

51:31.663 --> 51:32.663
Yes!

51:49.348 --> 51:50.515
What?

51:51.934 --> 51:56.896
Who is he that dares
destroy my beautiful baby?

52:01.068 --> 52:02.068
It's a woman.

52:02.152 --> 52:03.277
I can see.

52:03.362 --> 52:04.403
Marteetee,

52:04.696 --> 52:06.656
when I was a child
you enslaved my father

52:06.740 --> 52:08.699
and slaughtered him
in this very arena.

52:08.992 --> 52:10.243
Today I avenge him.

52:10.327 --> 52:13.120
First by killing the beast,
second, by killing you.

52:13.330 --> 52:16.999
Well, well,
my tiny bee...

52:20.379 --> 52:22.296
Oh, shit.

52:31.390 --> 52:32.849
Let's go!
We're going!

52:47.865 --> 52:49.282
Brother, are you
all right? I'm fine!

52:49.408 --> 52:50.533
Come on, let's go!

52:52.119 --> 52:53.452
This way!

53:05.382 --> 53:06.716
Excuse me, my lady.

53:06.800 --> 53:09.176
May I but speak
with you a moment?

53:09.636 --> 53:11.012
I'd like to
introduce myself.

53:11.096 --> 53:13.264
I am Prince Fabious
of Mourne

53:13.473 --> 53:15.725
and this is my brother,
Thadeous,

53:15.809 --> 53:18.436
and his squire,
young Courtney.

53:18.520 --> 53:19.520
Hello.

53:19.605 --> 53:22.356
We'd like to thank you for
your help with that dread beast.

53:22.482 --> 53:24.901
I have no time for
your maiden pleasantries.

53:24.985 --> 53:26.485
My quest continues
to the north.

53:26.570 --> 53:28.404
As does ours.

53:29.364 --> 53:31.157
I thought maybe for the
sake of both our quests,

53:31.241 --> 53:32.575
that we could
travel together.

53:32.743 --> 53:35.077
At least, until we
reach civilization.

53:35.370 --> 53:36.454
Yes, civilization.

53:36.538 --> 53:38.748
We are good men, we're
questing to save my...

53:38.916 --> 53:40.082
Excuse my brother.

53:40.167 --> 53:43.044
He's not familiar with
the customs of the road.

53:43.211 --> 53:45.713
Do not touch me. Why are
you making me look bad?

53:45.839 --> 53:48.507
A warrior on the road never
divulges the nature of his quest.

53:48.759 --> 53:51.218
One never knows if his aim
may conflict with another's.

53:51.303 --> 53:53.179
Yes, I was
just being nice.

53:53.889 --> 53:55.514
As we are
on the same path,

53:55.599 --> 53:58.267
I suppose you boys may
follow me to Muldiss Darton.

53:58.435 --> 54:00.519
From there I seek
navigation and march alone.

54:00.687 --> 54:03.606
We thank you. And
may we have your name?

54:04.066 --> 54:05.191
I'm Isabel.

54:05.359 --> 54:07.818
The last living member
of the Harshbarger order.

54:07.986 --> 54:10.613
Well, Isabel, my brother
and myself will ensure

54:10.781 --> 54:13.157
that you run into no danger
while you travel with us.

54:13.241 --> 54:15.868
With our huge muscles,
we shall protect you.

54:16.119 --> 54:17.495
Who? Protect what?

54:17.663 --> 54:19.163
To be fair,
everyone will protect

54:19.247 --> 54:21.165
each other equally,
I'm certain.

54:21.333 --> 54:25.336
But we will protect her
more because we are men.

54:33.470 --> 54:35.304
Boo!
Gods!

54:35.472 --> 54:36.597
What are you doing,
Brother?

54:36.765 --> 54:39.266
What right do you have,
scaring a man like that?

54:39.434 --> 54:41.227
Oh. What right
have you to spy

54:41.311 --> 54:42.978
on a bathing woman
from the shrubs?

54:43.480 --> 54:45.439
I'm simply
keeping an eye on her.

54:45.607 --> 54:47.817
She is not like one of
our dimwitted chamber maids

54:47.901 --> 54:49.652
that let me take
them from behind.

54:49.736 --> 54:51.278
This woman has me vexed.

54:51.363 --> 54:52.780
What exactly
would it take for one

54:52.864 --> 54:54.699
to tame such
an adventurous slut?

54:55.409 --> 54:58.285
I imagine she'd want
her man to be honorable,

54:58.370 --> 55:01.580
bold, brave, know his
way around a blade.

55:01.790 --> 55:05.584
Oh, god, she's looking at
us. Remain perfectly still.

55:29.151 --> 55:31.819
Mmm. We're almost
out of wood.

55:33.488 --> 55:36.907
Courtney, perhaps you and I should
go and collect some firewood.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.242
Yeah.

55:38.326 --> 55:41.871
If you two wouldn't mind
tending these embers.

55:42.330 --> 55:43.372
No, of course not.

55:43.874 --> 55:45.499
Tend away.

56:00.140 --> 56:03.225
Care for another bite
of some meat?

56:07.856 --> 56:10.357
You're not much
for talking, are you?

56:10.525 --> 56:13.736
A true warrior must keep
her focus on the road.

56:13.904 --> 56:16.614
One never knows when
death might be dealt.

56:16.740 --> 56:18.365
Mmm. Yes, of course.

56:19.034 --> 56:20.743
I've been involved in many

56:20.827 --> 56:23.913
death dealings in
focus-al moments.

56:24.080 --> 56:25.748
Yes, by your
childish shrieks

56:25.832 --> 56:27.208
in the face of
Marteetee's beast,

56:27.292 --> 56:29.126
one could see as much.

56:29.211 --> 56:30.836
What exactly is
your problem with me?

56:31.046 --> 56:33.672
Do you have a sword stuck
so far up your butt-hole

56:33.757 --> 56:36.425
that you cannot even enjoy
yourself for one moment?

56:36.551 --> 56:39.094
My quest affords me
no such luxury.

56:39.262 --> 56:41.430
Not even on a tender
night like this?

56:41.723 --> 56:43.265
The moons glimmering,

56:43.350 --> 56:46.060
the cold air
licking your tits.

56:46.394 --> 56:50.231
On a night just like this
I returned home from a hunt

56:50.398 --> 56:52.274
to find a bloodbath.

56:52.442 --> 56:54.610
Nothing remained of
my six beloved brothers

56:54.694 --> 56:56.946
save for their
severed heads on stakes.

56:57.030 --> 56:58.823
Their eyes
had been plucked,

56:58.907 --> 57:01.158
their teeth
taken as tokens.

57:01.243 --> 57:04.912
I wear this bracelet, forged
of the steel of their shields,

57:05.080 --> 57:07.623
as a constant reminder
of my vow to avenge them.

57:07.791 --> 57:11.335
My only advice would just
be to keep your head up,

57:11.419 --> 57:12.878
hang in there,

57:12.963 --> 57:15.047
live every day
to the fullest,

57:15.257 --> 57:16.924
have sex
as much as you can

57:17.008 --> 57:18.551
by campfire when
you're all alone

57:18.718 --> 57:20.761
and your brother is
out gathering wood.

57:20.929 --> 57:22.388
Just simple things
like that.

57:24.724 --> 57:26.767
Do you think he'll make
love with her tonight?

57:26.935 --> 57:28.727
Not a chance.

57:32.274 --> 57:35.568
Either way, I've spent a
lifetime often envious of him.

57:35.735 --> 57:36.777
Envious of Thadeous?

57:37.279 --> 57:40.781
All the times that he could
sit back and have a laugh

57:40.949 --> 57:43.617
and really
enjoy the moment.

57:43.785 --> 57:46.245
And I was up on stage

57:46.329 --> 57:49.039
wearing make-up
to cover my acne.

57:49.124 --> 57:51.667
My hair perfectly coiffed,
even for war.

57:53.461 --> 57:56.505
I think you misunderstand
the situation.

57:56.673 --> 58:01.927
He constantly gazes at you
with such eager eyes.

58:02.470 --> 58:05.139
Sometimes he
borrows your armor

58:05.307 --> 58:09.393
and he prances around the
courtyard, flailing your sword,

58:09.477 --> 58:12.062
going, "I am Fabious!

58:12.147 --> 58:14.315
"Look at me slay dragon. "

58:15.859 --> 58:18.527
He does it out of love.
He loves you, sir.

58:19.112 --> 58:20.654
He adores you.

58:23.116 --> 58:26.368
I know tragedy as well.
My mother is dead.

58:26.536 --> 58:28.662
I have someone dead
in my family, too.

58:28.830 --> 58:30.915
Also, recently

58:30.999 --> 58:34.084
my brother's
bride-to-be was stolen

58:34.336 --> 58:36.170
by a devious wizard.

58:36.463 --> 58:37.755
Wizard?

58:37.839 --> 58:39.089
Mmm-hmm.

58:39.174 --> 58:40.215
Huh.

58:40.300 --> 58:41.717
If you could
keep a secret,

58:42.844 --> 58:44.261
it was Leezar.

58:44.346 --> 58:45.512
Leezar?

58:45.597 --> 58:46.847
Mmm-hmm.

58:47.182 --> 58:48.182
Ah.

58:48.308 --> 58:50.601
I understand he's
a very dangerous man.

58:50.685 --> 58:53.354
Duh. That's why
Fabious turned to me.

58:53.521 --> 58:56.774
The most bold and brave and
honorable man that he knows.

58:56.858 --> 58:57.858
Mmm.

58:57.943 --> 59:00.194
We aim to kill
the magical cocksucker.

59:00.528 --> 59:02.279
Do you see this compass?

59:02.697 --> 59:04.782
What a fascinating device.

59:05.742 --> 59:08.243
It will lead us to a
labyrinth which holds a blade.

59:08.411 --> 59:12.206
The only weapon strong
enough to defeat the wizard.

59:12.374 --> 59:15.042
Well, perhaps
I misjudged you.

59:15.210 --> 59:16.710
It's not your fault.

59:16.878 --> 59:19.672
I know I may seem like
I have a rugged exterior,

59:19.839 --> 59:24.718
but underneath it all, I have a
golden heart that beats and beats.

59:41.903 --> 59:44.071
So beautiful.

59:48.410 --> 59:50.119
That poor creature.

59:57.711 --> 59:58.794
That's right.

01:00:02.632 --> 01:00:03.799
Look at yourself.

01:00:03.967 --> 01:00:06.802
Why would anyone ever
want to be with you?

01:00:06.928 --> 01:00:08.887
Hmm. I'm not sure, really.

01:00:08.972 --> 01:00:10.848
Oh, yeah.
Perhaps, because I'm rich,

01:00:10.932 --> 01:00:13.100
I live in a castle
and I can do magic.

01:00:13.268 --> 01:00:19.148
Okay, then why did you need to
kidnap me if you're so desirable?

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:21.942
Because I'm
the prophecy born, maybe.

01:00:22.110 --> 01:00:24.236
Or I'm going to
have a dragon soon

01:00:24.404 --> 01:00:25.696
which I'll be able
to control,

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.281
and it's going to
give me ultimate power.

01:00:27.449 --> 01:00:29.700
How? Because you can
make a dragon do things?

01:00:29.784 --> 01:00:32.327
Yes. I could
make it devour people

01:00:32.412 --> 01:00:34.788
or breathe fire over
the Kingdom of Mourne.

01:00:34.956 --> 01:00:36.707
Mmm. Sounds flimsy.

01:00:36.791 --> 01:00:38.542
First of all,
you obviously don't know

01:00:38.626 --> 01:00:40.627
jack shit
about the prophecy.

01:00:40.795 --> 01:00:43.797
How do you know that it won't
be me who controls the dragon?

01:00:43.965 --> 01:00:46.425
Because
I am the chosen one.

01:00:46.593 --> 01:00:49.928
Chosen one
controls the dragon.

01:00:50.096 --> 01:00:51.722
Those are the rules,
basically.

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:56.143
What are you laughing at?

01:00:56.311 --> 01:00:57.644
I was just thinking
about your penis

01:00:57.729 --> 01:00:59.938
and how unusual
it must look.

01:01:00.732 --> 01:01:02.316
It doesn't look unusual.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:03.984
How do you know
it's going to work?

01:01:04.194 --> 01:01:06.236
Because I've tested it.
Really?

01:01:06.654 --> 01:01:10.491
And if your vagina is
anything like my hand

01:01:10.658 --> 01:01:13.494
there will be
no problem.

01:01:16.998 --> 01:01:19.958
Fair warriors, arise.

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.169
Two days
before the eclipse.

01:01:22.253 --> 01:01:25.422
Thadeous, hand me the compass
so I can check its shadow.

01:01:25.507 --> 01:01:26.590
What?

01:01:26.674 --> 01:01:27.800
The compass.

01:01:27.926 --> 01:01:29.176
Oh.

01:01:30.887 --> 01:01:32.387
That's weird.

01:01:32.472 --> 01:01:34.681
It was around my neck
when I slept.

01:01:34.849 --> 01:01:36.350
Where is it,
Thadeous?

01:01:36.518 --> 01:01:38.352
I don't know.
I just woke up.

01:01:38.603 --> 01:01:40.729
Isabel seems
to have gone.

01:01:40.855 --> 01:01:41.980
Isabel!

01:01:42.148 --> 01:01:44.650
Isabel!

01:01:45.193 --> 01:01:46.151
Shit.

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:47.319
Thadeous,

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:48.946
you didn't
by chance tell her

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:51.532
anything about the nature
of our quest, did you?

01:01:52.033 --> 01:01:54.535
I may have dropped

01:01:54.702 --> 01:01:56.537
a few minor details.

01:01:56.704 --> 01:01:58.413
Did you tell Isabel

01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:02.751
anything about the
one-of-a-kind mythical compass?

01:02:04.879 --> 01:02:06.130
Mmm.

01:02:06.214 --> 01:02:07.756
Gods!

01:02:07.924 --> 01:02:09.424
She's run off
with the compass.

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:11.343
We don't know that
for sure. Oh, yeah?

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:14.429
Where is it?
Where is she?

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:16.807
All right, well,
it wasn't my fault.

01:02:16.891 --> 01:02:19.184
I was falling madly
in love with her.

01:02:19.269 --> 01:02:21.520
I was bedazzled
by her sweet bosom.

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:22.604
I was helpless.

01:02:22.689 --> 01:02:23.730
You fool!

01:02:23.898 --> 01:02:27.276
Without the compass, how do
we find the Blade of Unicorn?

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.736
And without that sword,
how do we defeat Leezar?

01:02:29.904 --> 01:02:32.906
Maybe we can find some other
way, with nets or something.

01:02:33.074 --> 01:02:34.241
Nets?

01:02:34.409 --> 01:02:35.909
Oh, that's a great plan.

01:02:36.077 --> 01:02:38.871
And meanwhile, Belladonna's
going to get raped and die!

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:41.248
We don't know for sure
if she'll die.

01:02:41.416 --> 01:02:42.875
Is this a joke to you?

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.669
Look, I'm sorry, but I
shouldn't even be here.

01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:48.338
We've almost been
killed multiple times.

01:02:48.423 --> 01:02:50.174
I will probably die
on this quest.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.384
Courtney definitely will.

01:02:53.261 --> 01:02:55.470
Fuck Courtney,
and fuck you!

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:58.473
Maybe they're right,
everything they say about you.

01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:00.434
They only say that stuff
because of you,

01:03:00.518 --> 01:03:03.061
because you go out and have
to pretend to be the best.

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.147
And they look at me like
I'm some sort of idiot.

01:03:05.231 --> 01:03:07.274
Everyone in the kingdom
wants to suck your dick.

01:03:07.442 --> 01:03:09.818
No one wants
to suck mine!

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.905
Oh, Thadeous,

01:03:13.072 --> 01:03:16.158
you have the potential
to be such a noble warrior,

01:03:16.326 --> 01:03:18.911
but instead you
just let yourself go,

01:03:19.078 --> 01:03:20.996
and everyone around you.

01:03:21.164 --> 01:03:23.999
You have no idea
what it's like to be me.

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:26.335
Being your brother
is a curse.

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:29.796
I'd rather be brothers
with anyone else but you.

01:03:34.177 --> 01:03:37.888
You say nothing else for
fear of what I might do.

01:03:37.972 --> 01:03:39.765
Nothing!

01:03:41.517 --> 01:03:44.186
Now get dressed
and comb your hair.

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:45.812
I'm going
to Muldiss Darton.

01:04:12.006 --> 01:04:13.632
Sex.

01:04:23.643 --> 01:04:25.560
Come on, Courtney.

01:04:25.728 --> 01:04:27.062
Come on.

01:04:37.198 --> 01:04:41.076
For better or worse,
we're here. Muldiss Darton.

01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:55.674
You and Courtney
entertain yourselves.

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.384
I'm going off to
find the sword alone.

01:04:57.468 --> 01:04:58.510
Alone?

01:04:58.594 --> 01:05:00.262
I can't afford to
waste any more time.

01:05:00.346 --> 01:05:02.889
Well, what are we to do?

01:05:03.057 --> 01:05:05.600
Do whatever it is
you do, Thadeous.

01:05:08.563 --> 01:05:11.898
Well, obviously
he's still upset.

01:05:21.701 --> 01:05:23.618
Oh, gods, Courtney.

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:25.412
How my heart laments.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.374
Having been betrayed by the
sways of a beautiful woman.

01:05:29.542 --> 01:05:32.502
And Fabious, throwing
his goddamn tantrums

01:05:32.587 --> 01:05:35.422
with no regard for
anyone else's feelings.

01:05:35.715 --> 01:05:37.883
He really needs
to consider...

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.760
Sir, look over there.

01:05:39.844 --> 01:05:42.346
It's that thieving Isabel.

01:05:43.222 --> 01:05:45.974
My gods!
The balls of this woman!

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.935
Do you think any of those
men are her boyfriends?

01:05:49.103 --> 01:05:50.228
Possibly.

01:05:50.313 --> 01:05:52.105
Who would ever want
to be her boyfriend?

01:05:52.231 --> 01:05:53.315
What do we do?

01:05:53.441 --> 01:05:54.941
I'll tell you
what we do.

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:57.861
We go over there,
we get the compass back,

01:05:57.945 --> 01:05:59.363
we give it to Fabious,

01:05:59.447 --> 01:06:00.822
we make him
feel horrible

01:06:00.907 --> 01:06:02.366
for the way in
which he treated me,

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.242
and then you
and I head for home.

01:06:04.494 --> 01:06:06.787
You believe it to be
as easy as that, sir?

01:06:06.954 --> 01:06:10.624
Courtney, she is a
woman, and we are a man.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.960
How hard could this be?

01:06:14.128 --> 01:06:15.796
It's my birthday today,
you know.

01:06:15.963 --> 01:06:17.339
Fuck that.

01:06:45.243 --> 01:06:46.243
Boremont!

01:06:46.327 --> 01:06:48.120
You dare to
betray me twice?

01:06:48.287 --> 01:06:50.163
No, it's the same
betrayal as before.

01:06:50.248 --> 01:06:51.665
It all just
counts as one.

01:06:51.749 --> 01:06:55.001
I suggest you surrender before
my father's army gets here.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:58.380
After Simon's message, they
should be arriving nigh on now.

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.757
Ah, yes.

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:03.343
About your tin pet.

01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:07.722
Simon.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.644
Best of luck
with your quest.

01:07:12.728 --> 01:07:14.396
And you with yours.

01:07:19.485 --> 01:07:21.695
Not so fast,
trickster.

01:07:21.988 --> 01:07:23.738
Hello, Thadeous.

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:25.282
The time for
pleasantries is through.

01:07:25.366 --> 01:07:27.075
Do you feel that tiny
prick in your back?

01:07:27.243 --> 01:07:28.410
Is that your cock?

01:07:28.578 --> 01:07:32.080
No, 'tis a knife, but I'll
gladly penetrate you with it.

01:07:32.248 --> 01:07:33.874
Now look over
your shoulder.

01:07:34.041 --> 01:07:36.042
Other shoulder.

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.714
Frightening.
Mmm-hmm.

01:07:40.882 --> 01:07:44.259
We have you surrounded.
An animal in a cage.

01:07:44.427 --> 01:07:46.094
Now sit.

01:07:52.727 --> 01:07:56.688
So, who were those handsome
men you were talking to?

01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:58.315
My contacts.

01:07:58.399 --> 01:07:59.816
Mmm. By contacts
do you mean

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:02.611
men you trick into liking
you so you can fuck them over?

01:08:02.695 --> 01:08:03.987
What are you
talking about?

01:08:04.071 --> 01:08:05.113
You know what
I'm talking about.

01:08:05.198 --> 01:08:06.698
The compass.
Hand it over now.

01:08:06.866 --> 01:08:08.241
You lied.
It does nothing.

01:08:08.493 --> 01:08:11.369
Maybe if you would've gone to
the Wize Wizard like we did,

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:15.081
he could have explained to you
that it only works in sunlight.

01:08:15.249 --> 01:08:16.500
Really?

01:08:16.584 --> 01:08:18.417
Shit, I shouldn't
have told you that.

01:08:18.544 --> 01:08:20.295
Isn't the Wize Wizard
a pervert?

01:08:20.379 --> 01:08:21.421
Yes.

01:08:21.923 --> 01:08:23.756
Sadly, I think he
molested my brother.

01:08:24.258 --> 01:08:25.509
That's unfortunate.

01:08:25.593 --> 01:08:27.969
Enough of your sympathy.
The compass. Give it.

01:08:28.136 --> 01:08:30.095
I need it
to destroy Leezar.

01:08:30.264 --> 01:08:31.555
Your quest is
to kill Leezar?

01:08:31.724 --> 01:08:34.600
Yes. My family is the
order of the Golden Knights.

01:08:34.769 --> 01:08:37.812
We're sworn to obstruct the
prophecy of the dragon eclipse.

01:08:38.231 --> 01:08:39.648
That's what
the Golden Knights do?

01:08:39.814 --> 01:08:41.691
It is my legacy
to stop anyone

01:08:41.776 --> 01:08:43.734
who wants to fuck
to make dragons.

01:08:43.903 --> 01:08:46.904
Yuck. Well, that's the same
thing we're trying to do.

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:49.157
Why would you hinder us
and steal the compass?

01:08:49.283 --> 01:08:51.660
His mothers sent my
brothers to their death.

01:08:51.868 --> 01:08:53.620
I must stop Leezar
and I can't afford

01:08:53.703 --> 01:08:55.162
to let anyone get
in my way.

01:08:55.288 --> 01:08:57.791
Least of all,
a slob and his boy.

01:08:57.959 --> 01:08:59.876
Guess what?
I despise you.

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:01.962
You're a bully
and a whore.

01:09:02.129 --> 01:09:03.921
Now give me
the compass now.

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:05.090
And if I don't?

01:09:05.174 --> 01:09:06.216
Well,

01:09:09.636 --> 01:09:11.304
then things will
get very nasty.

01:09:11.471 --> 01:09:12.471
Oh, really?

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.182
Oh, really.

01:09:17.728 --> 01:09:18.728
Shit!

01:09:22.316 --> 01:09:23.441
Oh, shit!

01:09:26.444 --> 01:09:28.321
Oh! God! Courtney,
fucking do something.

01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:29.823
Your Highness!

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:30.991
Excuse me.

01:09:31.158 --> 01:09:32.158
What the fuck?

01:09:38.165 --> 01:09:39.541
Take that shit outside!

01:09:42.587 --> 01:09:43.670
Oh, sorry.

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.264
Hello.

01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:31.968
Thank you for the
hospitality, gentlemen.

01:10:32.053 --> 01:10:33.511
That didn't
really go as planned.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:35.138
She's gone and now
so is the compass.

01:10:35.222 --> 01:10:36.931
She is, indeed,
gone, sir.

01:10:37.099 --> 01:10:39.893
The compass,
however, is right here.

01:10:39.977 --> 01:10:41.645
Courtney, my good man.

01:10:42.855 --> 01:10:44.022
How did you do it?

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:45.315
Before your father
bought me,

01:10:45.399 --> 01:10:48.652
I was a sex slave for a
band of gypsies in the north

01:10:48.736 --> 01:10:52.030
and they taught me a thing
or two about sleight-of-hand.

01:10:52.239 --> 01:10:53.740
Oh, you.

01:10:53.908 --> 01:10:55.575
Now you see me,
now you don't.

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.160
Delicious.

01:11:00.039 --> 01:11:01.706
I can't wait
to see the look

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:04.501
on Fabious' silly face
when he sees this.

01:11:04.585 --> 01:11:05.585
Clear!

01:11:10.591 --> 01:11:11.633
Fabious.

01:11:11.717 --> 01:11:13.385
What do we do?

01:11:13.928 --> 01:11:15.095
I'll tell you what we do.

01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:18.390
We will steal a steed and we
will ride to the next town.

01:11:18.599 --> 01:11:20.225
We become ghosts,
start a brand new life,

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.686
one where you still serve
me. And we're stable boys,

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:24.396
and we bed the fickle
wives of farmers.

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.689
What about Fabious?

01:11:25.773 --> 01:11:26.898
Oh, Fabious.

01:11:27.066 --> 01:11:28.316
We'll remember him fondly.

01:11:28.401 --> 01:11:30.985
I really think we should
try and rescue him.

01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:33.321
But, how, Courtney? You
are weak, and I am hungry.

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.784
You deceitful pricks. You
stole the compass from me.

01:11:37.952 --> 01:11:40.370
Who? I didn't.
Courtney did.

01:11:40.454 --> 01:11:42.205
Please have mercy
on us, lady warrior.

01:11:42.790 --> 01:11:45.417
Fabious has been captured
by Leezar and his men.

01:11:45.584 --> 01:11:47.168
He was captured?

01:11:47.253 --> 01:11:48.336
Yes.

01:11:48.671 --> 01:11:51.423
We got into
a huge swordfight

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:53.383
and we were able
to escape

01:11:53.467 --> 01:11:55.343
and he was not.

01:11:55.469 --> 01:11:57.345
I know how
you're feeling inside.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:58.555
As if you cannot rest

01:11:58.639 --> 01:12:02.350
until you destroy those
who harmed your family.

01:12:02.435 --> 01:12:06.271
You want to skin them alive
then wear their flesh as a cape

01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:09.441
as you dance around
their convulsing corpses.

01:12:10.818 --> 01:12:11.818
Yes, of course.

01:12:11.902 --> 01:12:12.986
Yes.

01:12:13.154 --> 01:12:15.196
That feeling is
all too familiar.

01:12:15.489 --> 01:12:16.823
It's been burning
in my beaver

01:12:16.907 --> 01:12:19.075
since the day
I lost my brothers.

01:12:19.493 --> 01:12:21.035
We've had
our differences,

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.246
but if we work together,

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:26.291
we can save your brother,
avenge my family,

01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:29.335
and destroy Leezar
once and for all.

01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:32.839
This woman is mad.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.319
I believe we found
our labyrinth.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:58.031
Where? The compass has
led us to a dead end.

01:12:58.199 --> 01:13:00.158
Shall we return home?

01:13:00.326 --> 01:13:02.243
It appears as though there's
something written here

01:13:02.328 --> 01:13:04.162
in the language of
the Highland Dwarf.

01:13:04.538 --> 01:13:05.830
I can't read it.

01:13:05.998 --> 01:13:10.543
Sir, you're well-versed in the
Highland Dwarf language, aren't you?

01:13:10.878 --> 01:13:13.046
You read Dwarf,
Thadeous?

01:13:13.214 --> 01:13:16.090
I have had encounters
with those people, yes.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.843
Really? Well, then
what does it say?

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.054
Fucker.

01:13:29.563 --> 01:13:30.939
It's nonsense.

01:13:31.106 --> 01:13:34.859
It says, "What leads you
here will lead you there. "

01:13:34.944 --> 01:13:36.194
It's rubbish.

01:13:36.278 --> 01:13:37.862
Highland Dwarves
are a silly culture.

01:13:37.947 --> 01:13:41.032
Oftentimes they speak and I have
no idea what they're talking about.

01:13:43.744 --> 01:13:44.911
What is she doing?

01:13:45.246 --> 01:13:46.663
Perfect fit.

01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:08.685
You coming?

01:14:53.147 --> 01:14:54.731
What is that
foul stench?

01:14:55.941 --> 01:14:57.525
What was that noise?

01:14:57.693 --> 01:15:01.321
I don't know, Courtney.
But I don't like this.

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.334
I fear we're
not alone in here.

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.026
What is that thing?
I don't know, but run!

01:15:44.198 --> 01:15:45.406
Isabel!

01:15:51.872 --> 01:15:53.373
Sir?

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.667
Help! Your Highness!

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.251
Courtney!

01:15:57.419 --> 01:15:58.461
Thadeous!

01:15:58.712 --> 01:16:00.463
Isabel!

01:16:00.547 --> 01:16:03.216
Companions,
where are you?

01:16:05.719 --> 01:16:08.596
Courtney! Hello?

01:16:08.764 --> 01:16:10.056
Thadeous!

01:16:16.230 --> 01:16:17.313
Where are you, sire?

01:17:10.075 --> 01:17:13.119
This is the Blade
of Unicorn?

01:17:13.287 --> 01:17:15.163
It's just bones.

01:17:20.919 --> 01:17:22.962
You've found it.

01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:25.757
Who said that?

01:17:26.258 --> 01:17:31.179
'Tis I, the soul of this maze
and protector of the blade.

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.097
'Tis my duty to ensure

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:37.477
only a true hero carries
the blade from this tomb.

01:17:37.561 --> 01:17:38.728
Okay.

01:17:38.812 --> 01:17:40.897
Say, for instance,
a man entered here

01:17:40.981 --> 01:17:43.066
by accident who
wasn't a true hero.

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:44.859
What would happen
to him?

01:17:44.985 --> 01:17:46.527
Death.

01:17:47.154 --> 01:17:48.488
I see. Well,

01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:50.531
I am no true hero.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:55.036
So I would like to just place
the sword back where I found it,

01:17:55.204 --> 01:17:58.498
and then I will go my way,
and you won't kill me,

01:17:58.665 --> 01:18:00.374
and that will
be that, okay?

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:01.793
Go?

01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:04.378
Where would
you like to go?

01:18:08.133 --> 01:18:09.300
Is that...

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:11.135
Your home.

01:18:11.303 --> 01:18:14.639
Okay, well, I would surely
go there. That would be fine.

01:18:14.765 --> 01:18:17.433
Shall I just slide the
sword back into the thingy,

01:18:17.518 --> 01:18:19.644
or place it gently
upon the ground?

01:18:19.728 --> 01:18:21.771
And if I told you
that your brother

01:18:21.939 --> 01:18:24.690
will die without the
help of this blade,

01:18:24.775 --> 01:18:27.568
would you still walk
through that door?

01:18:27.653 --> 01:18:30.363
Without the blade, Fabious
will be helpless against Leezar.

01:18:31.573 --> 01:18:34.158
Shut your magical hole.
Why are you showing me this?

01:18:34.243 --> 01:18:36.869
It's what you wanted,
is it not?

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:38.538
Your brother gone.

01:18:38.664 --> 01:18:40.998
You'll be king
of all the land.

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:43.668
Think of the power,

01:18:43.836 --> 01:18:47.630
the women, the bush, the
sticky-icky, the honeypots.

01:18:47.798 --> 01:18:51.008
Well, it would be nice
to be king.

01:18:51.176 --> 01:18:55.221
And all you have to do
is forget about the blade.

01:18:55.389 --> 01:19:00.685
Leave it where you found it and
never think of this place again.

01:19:03.188 --> 01:19:07.692
That's very sweet but I
am not a female Minotaur.

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.193
Ow!

01:19:10.362 --> 01:19:12.280
His worm
is tickling me.

01:19:18.036 --> 01:19:19.412
Get off of me!

01:19:20.414 --> 01:19:22.290
I'm not enjoying this!

01:19:23.876 --> 01:19:25.209
Get off me.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:41.642
Whew!

01:19:57.242 --> 01:19:59.243
Did you just see that?

01:19:59.411 --> 01:20:02.079
I came back for you all!
I saved you!

01:20:02.206 --> 01:20:03.748
What, you were going
to leave us?

01:20:04.374 --> 01:20:06.250
No, of course not.

01:20:06.752 --> 01:20:08.794
Is that the...

01:20:08.879 --> 01:20:10.296
Blade of Unicorn?

01:20:10.631 --> 01:20:13.716
Yes, my companions, it is.

01:20:13.884 --> 01:20:15.259
It's so beautiful.

01:20:15.427 --> 01:20:18.095
It's very, very sharp.

01:20:20.265 --> 01:20:22.308
Come here, you silly.

01:20:24.978 --> 01:20:26.979
What are you doing?

01:20:27.147 --> 01:20:31.776
I was just trying to cut this
horn as a souvenir of my kill,

01:20:31.944 --> 01:20:33.861
but it's proving to
be a bit of a bitch.

01:20:35.113 --> 01:20:38.324
You can never sever
the horn of a Minotaur.

01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:39.450
Hmm.

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:48.042
Only a champion man

01:20:48.126 --> 01:20:51.045
would hold the Blade
of Unicorn in his hands.

01:20:51.129 --> 01:20:54.340
And I, Thadeous,
am that man.

01:20:55.509 --> 01:20:57.510
I have seen the pain
in my reflection

01:20:57.594 --> 01:21:01.347
And watched the strength
of my brother, unflinching.

01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:04.642
My quest is one of love,

01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:08.312
but also in this moment of
forgiveness, of redemption,

01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:10.773
even amongst
the smallest of foes.

01:21:18.824 --> 01:21:20.866
My path has been unstable

01:21:20.951 --> 01:21:24.912
but my conviction is born to
damn the fuckers who doubted me.

01:21:24.997 --> 01:21:27.373
To lessen the assholes
who tested me.

01:21:36.008 --> 01:21:38.175
To right what is wrong.

01:21:39.011 --> 01:21:42.847
To restore faith
that has long been lost.

01:21:43.015 --> 01:21:45.975
And to rise to great heights
even beyond my own legend

01:21:46.059 --> 01:21:49.228
as a great cocksmith,
master pintsman,

01:21:49.313 --> 01:21:54.066
and stunningly handsome prince
of light in these dark Dark Ages.

01:21:56.361 --> 01:21:57.945
True trials await,

01:21:58.030 --> 01:22:00.114
and I will greet thee
with the hammer of my fist

01:22:00.198 --> 01:22:02.992
and the slide
of my sword.

01:22:04.202 --> 01:22:07.371
As the fog clears, I will
follow the voice that guides me.

01:22:07.456 --> 01:22:11.917
My love,
my heart, my gods.

01:22:12.044 --> 01:22:13.878
The time is now!

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.297
Let us quest!

01:22:17.507 --> 01:22:21.719
At long last, I have
you firmly in my grasp.

01:22:21.887 --> 01:22:24.388
The pesky Prince Fabious.

01:22:24.556 --> 01:22:27.808
The little sneak who
time and time again

01:22:27.893 --> 01:22:29.810
has foiled every one
of my plots.

01:22:30.187 --> 01:22:32.855
Who has slain
every one of my beasts.

01:22:33.023 --> 01:22:36.067
Who has bested me
without fail until now.

01:22:36.234 --> 01:22:39.904
Do what you will to me.
But unhand my love.

01:22:40.238 --> 01:22:42.281
Let Belladonna go!

01:22:42.407 --> 01:22:44.116
Cast your glance
heavenward

01:22:44.242 --> 01:22:47.912
and know that when the ceiling
parts, and the moons align,

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:51.248
I will be
entering your love.

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:53.417
Sacrilege!
You wretched wizard.

01:22:53.585 --> 01:22:57.338
My mothers have already
moistened Belladonna for foreplay.

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:00.007
You'll excuse me
if I take my leave.

01:23:01.593 --> 01:23:03.094
I shall kill you!

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.514
Julie, Julie,
get me out of here.

01:23:06.598 --> 01:23:08.516
Leezar has
a hold of your mind.

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:10.518
He has allowed me
to get even with you.

01:23:11.103 --> 01:23:13.687
For too long you
and your family

01:23:13.772 --> 01:23:15.981
have treated me
like an employee.

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:18.526
Yeah, you were my slave.

01:23:19.152 --> 01:23:21.028
Yes, well not anymore.

01:23:21.113 --> 01:23:23.280
Boremont, my comrade.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.699
Please,
get me out of here.

01:23:25.784 --> 01:23:30.371
If Leezar wins tonight, the entire
world will tumble into darkness.

01:23:30.455 --> 01:23:32.957
My heart has soured
on this world long ago.

01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:36.001
Perhaps a regime change
is just what it's needed.

01:23:36.128 --> 01:23:39.797
Boremont, you gave your hand for
me. Now you're taking my heart.

01:23:40.006 --> 01:23:42.425
We used to have
fucking picnics together.

01:23:42.592 --> 01:23:44.677
Remember when we crossed
swords and touched tips?

01:23:45.137 --> 01:23:46.220
Do you remember?

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:48.514
Look at me, Boremont!

01:23:48.765 --> 01:23:50.224
Don't do this.

01:23:50.725 --> 01:23:52.476
Anyway, so that
you don't feel like

01:23:52.561 --> 01:23:54.270
you're missing out
on any of the fun,

01:23:54.354 --> 01:23:57.606
let me introduce you
to my friend, Timotay.

01:23:58.024 --> 01:24:00.317
As Leezar
enters Belladonna,

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:03.237
he will lower you
onto that spike,

01:24:03.321 --> 01:24:06.490
thereby giving you
a good poking as well.

01:24:07.075 --> 01:24:09.201
Belladonna, I love you!

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:26.510
All right.

01:24:26.678 --> 01:24:30.097
Well, seeing that I did the bulk
of the work in the labyrinth,

01:24:30.182 --> 01:24:32.975
perhaps it's one of your
turns to lead the way now.

01:24:33.059 --> 01:24:35.895
Step back, new friends.
I'll lead the way.

01:24:36.062 --> 01:24:38.522
For tonight,
evil has met its match.

01:24:38.690 --> 01:24:42.526
Fantastic! Thank
you again for coming.

01:24:46.114 --> 01:24:47.198
Oh!

01:24:51.828 --> 01:24:52.995
God.

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:55.706
Wow, right out
of the gate.

01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:58.292
We should proceed
with a bit more caution.

01:24:58.460 --> 01:24:59.877
Let go of me!

01:25:00.253 --> 01:25:03.714
You foul witches!
I hate you all.

01:25:03.882 --> 01:25:05.299
Stop laughing.

01:25:05.383 --> 01:25:06.842
Silence!

01:25:06.968 --> 01:25:08.552
Let me go!

01:25:09.012 --> 01:25:12.640
I shall be unable to have sex
with her with all that shrieking.

01:25:12.724 --> 01:25:15.351
If it's obedience
that you want,

01:25:15.435 --> 01:25:17.186
we will put her
under a spell.

01:25:18.522 --> 01:25:19.813
She will surrender.

01:25:19.898 --> 01:25:21.524
Obey.

01:25:30.408 --> 01:25:32.826
Let it begin.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.489
The winch, Courtney.

01:26:10.574 --> 01:26:12.116
Brother!
What are you doing here?

01:26:12.659 --> 01:26:13.784
We came
to rescue you.

01:26:13.868 --> 01:26:14.952
You did?

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.495
Yes! Are you surprised?

01:26:16.955 --> 01:26:17.955
Yes!

01:26:18.039 --> 01:26:20.291
Courtney, you're
still alive! Isabel!

01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.836
All right. Great.

01:26:24.004 --> 01:26:26.171
We haven't much time!
Let's get weapons.

01:26:26.339 --> 01:26:28.882
Fabious, there's something
else I should tell you.

01:26:28.967 --> 01:26:30.050
What?

01:26:30.135 --> 01:26:32.344
I would never let your
true love come to harm.

01:26:33.138 --> 01:26:36.640
I present you with
the Blade of Unicorn.

01:26:37.309 --> 01:26:39.852
Brother,
it is beautiful.

01:26:40.770 --> 01:26:43.272
And Your Highness, please
forgive my deception.

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:45.441
Our two quests
now work as one.

01:26:46.318 --> 01:26:47.735
Nice.

01:26:47.902 --> 01:26:49.612
We're in this together, sir.

01:26:50.113 --> 01:26:51.530
Yes.

01:26:53.366 --> 01:26:54.491
Simon!

01:26:59.873 --> 01:27:02.082
Now mine eyes
have seen it all.

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:05.210
'Tis only a truce.
Courtney had him restored.

01:27:05.378 --> 01:27:06.879
He manipulated
me into friendship

01:27:06.963 --> 01:27:08.881
by tugging
at my heartstrings.

01:27:10.967 --> 01:27:11.925
Right.

01:27:12.010 --> 01:27:13.135
What's he saying?

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:16.472
It seems the way is more
treacherous than I thought.

01:27:16.556 --> 01:27:18.807
I cannot ask you
to come with me.

01:27:18.975 --> 01:27:21.935
I know you do not expect
much from me, Fabious.

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:24.146
But I will stand
with you on this night.

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:27.941
Is this the same brother
that would not be my best man?

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.737
I did not deserve
to be your best man.

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:34.156
You do now.

01:27:37.911 --> 01:27:40.579
We can finish this whenever
you maidens are ready.

01:27:42.332 --> 01:27:43.749
Ready!

01:28:27.794 --> 01:28:28.836
The time is nigh!

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.087
The moons are
about to align.

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:38.721
Intruders!

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:42.391
Prepare to be fist-fucked
by two brothers at once.

01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:48.981
You're too late!
The fuckening has begun.

01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:50.941
Get him!

01:28:54.028 --> 01:28:55.112
You shit!

01:28:55.238 --> 01:28:56.280
Kill them!

01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:33.358
Why is she
making these noises?

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:45.621
Courtney!

01:29:55.715 --> 01:29:56.840
Boremont!

01:29:58.426 --> 01:29:59.468
Bastard!

01:30:02.722 --> 01:30:04.097
Thadeous!

01:30:04.432 --> 01:30:05.974
I'm not stiffening!

01:30:06.142 --> 01:30:08.018
I'm just not
attracted to you.

01:30:08.186 --> 01:30:09.228
Fuck me!

01:30:11.439 --> 01:30:12.564
Love me!

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:26.203
Adiós, motherfucker!

01:30:26.579 --> 01:30:27.704
Teamwork!

01:30:58.695 --> 01:31:01.697
God, I never wanted it to
end like this, old friend.

01:31:02.073 --> 01:31:04.658
Master Fabious.

01:31:04.826 --> 01:31:06.869
I loved you!

01:31:08.538 --> 01:31:11.081
I loved you, too,
Boremont.

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:12.749
As only a knight
can love a knight.

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:13.917
No.

01:31:14.961 --> 01:31:17.254
I loved you

01:31:17.338 --> 01:31:20.841
as a man loves
another man.

01:31:22.927 --> 01:31:24.136
Oh.

01:31:41.112 --> 01:31:42.529
Jumping!

01:32:17.523 --> 01:32:19.024
Quick! We must hurry!

01:32:19.192 --> 01:32:22.027
What? No, no, don't
suck that! That's dead!

01:32:42.924 --> 01:32:45.592
Next time you want to smash
a bloodline of knights,

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.386
make sure you
kill all of them!

01:32:47.804 --> 01:32:48.971
We did!

01:32:49.222 --> 01:32:51.598
You forgot
about their sister.

01:33:08.658 --> 01:33:10.409
Thadeous!
What are you doing here?

01:33:10.576 --> 01:33:12.327
I'm trying to rescue you.
We must hurry!

01:33:12.412 --> 01:33:14.663
Step away
from my virgin.

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:19.084
She's my brother's virgin.

01:33:19.419 --> 01:33:21.628
If you want to fuck her,

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.880
you'll have to
fuck me first.

01:33:27.552 --> 01:33:29.261
It would be
my pleasure.

01:33:31.347 --> 01:33:32.806
Stop!

01:33:33.016 --> 01:33:34.391
It's over.

01:33:34.559 --> 01:33:37.477
Take your last breath
with nobility.

01:33:39.355 --> 01:33:41.690
You fool.

01:33:41.858 --> 01:33:45.152
I cannot be slain
by mortal blade.

01:33:45.319 --> 01:33:46.528
One must possess
the powerful...

01:33:46.612 --> 01:33:47.821
I know.

01:33:48.573 --> 01:33:50.115
Blade of Unicorn.

01:33:51.409 --> 01:33:52.826
It's not possible.

01:34:42.668 --> 01:34:44.085
My love.

01:34:55.807 --> 01:34:57.307
Think I'm beginning
to like the feel

01:34:57.391 --> 01:35:00.602
of blood and filth
upon these fingers.

01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:02.646
Perhaps I will
never bathe again.

01:35:04.106 --> 01:35:05.899
Unless, of course,
there were a bitch

01:35:05.983 --> 01:35:07.943
brave enough to
bathe beside me.

01:35:08.194 --> 01:35:09.778
You fought with honor.

01:35:09.862 --> 01:35:12.906
Why don't you treat yourself
and take rest at our castle?

01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:16.993
We've all the slaves, pickles and
servants one could ever desire.

01:35:17.495 --> 01:35:19.329
We have dancing bears,
Orientals

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:21.414
and all the berries
you care to pick.

01:35:22.124 --> 01:35:24.793
I wish I could,
but I never rest.

01:35:24.877 --> 01:35:28.046
There's yet another quest that
calls me to the Western Marshes.

01:35:28.130 --> 01:35:29.422
I must surprise
a band of thieves

01:35:29.507 --> 01:35:33.009
and burn them alive one by
one in a symphony of shrieks.

01:35:34.303 --> 01:35:36.847
I will not forget you,
Prince.

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.640
Nor will I.

01:35:43.855 --> 01:35:46.565
Here. To remember me. Oh.

01:35:46.983 --> 01:35:49.526
I don't want that
thing touching me.

01:35:49.861 --> 01:35:51.444
Say hello.
Ooh.

01:35:51.529 --> 01:35:52.529
No.

01:35:52.697 --> 01:35:54.114
I fucking killed
this dick. Take it.

01:35:54.198 --> 01:35:55.365
No, it's yours.

01:35:55.658 --> 01:35:58.243
I cannot accept
another warrior's trophy.

01:35:58.494 --> 01:35:59.744
Courtney, take my dick.

01:35:59.829 --> 01:36:01.204
With pleasure, sir.

01:36:01.664 --> 01:36:03.206
Till we meet again.

01:36:21.684 --> 01:36:23.184
Is thou all right,
Brother?

01:36:46.626 --> 01:36:48.376
I love you.

01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:50.879
I love you, too.

01:37:02.308 --> 01:37:04.100
They're cheering
for you.

01:37:04.226 --> 01:37:05.894
They're cheering
for all of us.

01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:07.896
Even for me?

01:37:08.314 --> 01:37:10.315
Especially you, Brother.

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.046
I'm proud of you, son.

01:37:33.297 --> 01:37:35.298
You saved
the entire land.

01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:37.133
Not a bad run
for a first quest.

01:37:37.301 --> 01:37:40.095
Well, I would be remiss
to say I did it alone.

01:37:40.179 --> 01:37:42.138
Fabious did help
where he could.

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:43.223
Hmm.
Hmm.

01:37:43.307 --> 01:37:44.766
I'm sure.

01:37:57.279 --> 01:37:59.948
Finally. Alone.

01:38:07.206 --> 01:38:11.584
Hello, there.
Cock-a-doodle-do.

01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:13.169
Ah, Isabel.

01:38:13.254 --> 01:38:14.379
Brother?

01:38:14.463 --> 01:38:15.797
Yes?

01:38:15.881 --> 01:38:17.298
Am I interrupting
something?

01:38:17.383 --> 01:38:19.551
Nothing, I was
preparing for bedtime

01:38:19.635 --> 01:38:22.303
and just looking at the
oils that Father gave me.

01:38:22.388 --> 01:38:24.806
Ah! I know
what you're doing!

01:38:24.974 --> 01:38:26.099
No, you don't.

01:38:27.685 --> 01:38:30.228
Well, seeing you by yourself at
the wedding didn't seem right.

01:38:30.396 --> 01:38:33.189
So, I've brought
you someone.

01:38:33.482 --> 01:38:35.525
Someone I know you've
been missing... Isabel?

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:37.736
...and who's been
missing you.

01:38:37.903 --> 01:38:40.155
I brought you Steven!

01:38:40.489 --> 01:38:41.740
Oh.

01:38:42.158 --> 01:38:44.409
I went on a mini-quest
and I found him for you.

01:38:45.202 --> 01:38:48.038
Well, that was

01:38:49.749 --> 01:38:51.958
very nice of you,
Fabious. Thank you.

01:38:52.126 --> 01:38:54.544
I had so much fun on
our adventure together.

01:38:54.712 --> 01:38:58.006
Yes, I know. You have told
me 15 fucking times now.

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:04.137
Well, I'm off to sleep
with Belladonna.

01:39:04.221 --> 01:39:05.305
I'm a little nervous.

01:39:05.389 --> 01:39:06.473
Don't be.

01:39:06.557 --> 01:39:09.434
Just swing your cock with the
same strength you swing your sword,

01:39:09.518 --> 01:39:11.394
and I'm sure
all will be fine.

01:39:12.563 --> 01:39:15.190
All right.
Sweet dreams, Brother.

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.817
Sweet dreams.

01:39:18.903 --> 01:39:20.528
Steven.

01:39:21.113 --> 01:39:25.658
Well, I'm going to put you in the
corner now while I strum my filthies.

01:39:25.743 --> 01:39:27.744
Come, come, Steven.

01:39:29.705 --> 01:39:31.706
Here we go.

01:39:34.627 --> 01:39:36.044
Isabel.

01:39:36.128 --> 01:39:39.798
I was able to wrap things up in
the west quicker than I expected.

01:39:39.882 --> 01:39:41.925
I've not been able to
stop thinking of you.

01:39:42.259 --> 01:39:45.762
What a coincidence. I was just
about to finish thinking of you.

01:39:53.771 --> 01:39:56.606
Wait.
Before we go any further,

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:58.024
there's something
I have to show you.

01:39:58.109 --> 01:40:00.068
What?

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.278
What the hell is that?

01:40:02.363 --> 01:40:03.780
It's a chastity belt

01:40:03.906 --> 01:40:06.699
put upon me by
an evil witch long ago.

01:40:06.784 --> 01:40:09.119
She now roams the snow
mountains of Shahmir.

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.287
If I can defeat her,

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:14.124
the curse will be broken,
the belt will fall free.

01:40:14.792 --> 01:40:16.042
So in order for us
to make love,

01:40:16.127 --> 01:40:20.004
we have to track down an evil
and, I'm assuming, dangerous witch?

01:40:20.089 --> 01:40:21.589
Exactly.

01:40:23.342 --> 01:40:24.342
Hmm.

01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:28.596
We would have to
do this right now?

01:40:28.681 --> 01:40:30.223
If you don't want
to join me,

01:40:30.307 --> 01:40:32.392
I could just take care
of it myself.

01:40:33.060 --> 01:40:36.104
No, of course I want to
come. We just got home.

01:40:36.188 --> 01:40:37.522
I was hoping to
have a few hours

01:40:37.606 --> 01:40:39.649
of just doing nothing,
perhaps just relaxing.

01:40:39.733 --> 01:40:42.026
Let's just stay here
and snuggle.

01:40:43.028 --> 01:40:44.112
Hmm.

01:40:44.196 --> 01:40:47.615
No, fuck it.
Let's kill that bitch.
