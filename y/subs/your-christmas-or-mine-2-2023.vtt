That’s not funny.

It’s not.

Oh, bloomin' heck.

01:44.870 --> 01:46.140
We can’t be the first ones here.

01:47.020 --> 01:48.190
Don’t worry, chill out.

01:48.400 --> 01:50.050
I told you we had heaps of time.

01:50.250 --> 01:51.400
Sorry, I know. I’m just...

I'm just a bit nervous about,

Mm, yeah.

01:54.880 --> 01:56.490
Yeah, it’s okay. I understand.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.110
But it will be fine. Okay?

I’m sure she’s really nice.

02:01.740 --> 02:02.600
Yeah.

Anyways, first things first.

You think you’d wait until
you at least got there.

02:17.360 --> 02:18.330
Innit?

02:18.530 --> 02:21.470
Anyway, I feel like proposing
at Christmas

02:21.680 --> 02:24.420
is sort of just saying, like,
“I didn’t know what to get ya."

02:24.610 --> 02:25.630
Well, it’s a good thing I knew

02:25.820 --> 02:26.920
just what to get you then,
isn’t it?

02:27.120 --> 02:28.210
Exactly.

02:28.410 --> 02:29.810
- A Fitbit.
- A Fitbit.

02:30.020 --> 02:33.470
Mhm. I’m gonna use it to track
how many steps it is

02:33.670 --> 02:34.630
from my flat to yours.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.740
It is the world’s
least romantic present.

02:37.070 --> 02:39.110
Well, I’ve only got you a card.

02:39.570 --> 02:42.180
Okay, it’s the world’s
second least romantic present.

02:42.380 --> 02:45.490
I guess that depends
what is written in the card.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.410
- Doesn’t it?
- Oh, really?

02:47.620 --> 02:48.460

Californian sunshine.

03:05.890 --> 03:06.870
How was the trip?

03:07.070 --> 03:09.440
Well, longer than expected,
but with good reason.

03:09.770 --> 03:11.750
I picked up a little something
on my travels.

- Oh.

- Oh. [laughs]

on the M42.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.180
[Kath] No, you missed out
the entire M42.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.510
We spent an hour behind
a road gritter in Redditch.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.970
And I thought it was
the Austrians

04:05.170 --> 04:06.520
I was gonna have
trouble understanding.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.580
Diane, meet the Taylors.

04:08.950 --> 04:11.460
You’ve done well there, old man.
I thought she was your carer!

04:11.750 --> 04:13.670
Yeah, it’s nice to see
you too, Geoff.

04:13.870 --> 04:15.820

04:16.020 --> 04:18.400
Thank you.
My stylist will be thrilled.

Mum would've loved all this.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.700
No, Geoff, she wouldn’t.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.510
She would've absolutely
hated it.

04:25.840 --> 04:27.100
I do miss her, you know, Kath.

04:27.890 --> 04:28.920
She’s at your sister’s.

Listen, Gilet,

05:35.460 --> 05:37.960
I hope your Dad’s alright
about the whole booking thing.

05:38.290 --> 05:40.360
It was good of him offering
to take care of it all,

05:40.560 --> 05:42.340
but we, well...

05:42.800 --> 05:45.580
Kath, felt more comfortable
if we looked after ourselves.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.470
Honestly Geoff, it’s fine.

05:47.840 --> 05:49.580
In the end we got
a bit of a bargain.

connections and sorted us out,

[sighs]

10:02.640 --> 10:03.680
[giggling]

10:05.020 --> 10:06.090
Everything is included.

10:06.280 --> 10:08.090
And for anything else...

10:08.290 --> 10:09.270
just ask for Gerhard.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.520
Danke schön, Gerhard!

10:11.730 --> 10:13.110
It’s my deepest pleasure.

10:14.650 --> 10:17.010
It's not every day that we
get to accommodate

10:17.210 --> 10:18.140
British aristocracy.

10:18.340 --> 10:20.200
[suspenseful music]

10:21.160 --> 10:25.410
You know, I did not understand
one word that man said.

10:25.660 --> 10:27.080
Not one word.

10:27.870 --> 10:29.170
[sighs]

10:40.640 --> 10:42.640
- Geoff.
- Nice bed.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.350
How much did you say
you paid for this place?

10:46.270 --> 10:48.190
Fifteen hundred euros all in.

10:49.270 --> 10:51.770
Right. And how likely is it,

10:52.110 --> 10:58.990
on a scale of ‘eins’
to ‘not very bloody likely’,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.730
that this is the hotel
that you booked for us?

11:02.920 --> 11:05.040
[exhales] I dunno.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.160
'Drei’?

11:07.950 --> 11:09.410
Fifteen hundred euros?

11:09.750 --> 11:10.570
A ‘drei’?

11:10.770 --> 11:13.530
That bathroom is bigger than
the Tesco Express!

11:13.730 --> 11:15.000
Okay, look...

11:16.000 --> 11:18.010
I think I might know
what’s happened here.

11:20.260 --> 11:21.740
Hotel Bergschaf?

11:21.940 --> 11:23.720
Berg-Schaf, Schaf-Berg.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.390
It’s almost right.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.970
Almost right?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.960
This is what happens
when you book a holiday

11:31.160 --> 11:32.340
through Darren down the Tuns

11:32.540 --> 11:33.960
instead of going to
a proper travel agent

11:34.160 --> 11:35.220
like I told you to!

11:35.420 --> 11:37.380
Darren was a proper travel agent
back in the day.

11:37.580 --> 11:38.470
Yeah, before he went to prison!

11:38.670 --> 11:39.850
Well, he sorted us a bargain!

11:40.040 --> 11:43.060
No, no. He has sorted us
the wrong hotel.

11:43.260 --> 11:46.560
Hotel Bergschaf is not
Hotel Schafberg, is it?

11:46.760 --> 11:48.850
I don’t know!
I’m not Austrian, am I!?

11:49.050 --> 11:50.520
You know what?
You had one job!

11:50.720 --> 11:53.980
Yeah, and that job was to book
a holiday for the entire family

11:54.180 --> 11:55.280
with a bunch of millionaires

11:55.480 --> 11:56.750
in the middle of
the bloody Alps!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.910
I’m an ice cream van man, Kath!

11:59.110 --> 12:00.910
A good one. Some say the best.

12:01.110 --> 12:03.390
But I’m not Richard
frickin’ Branson, am I?

12:04.180 --> 12:05.910
If we’d have just taken Humph up
on his offer, then...

12:06.110 --> 12:07.620
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Do not start with that.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.460
We are not a charity, Geoff.

12:09.660 --> 12:10.830
It's... erm...

12:11.030 --> 12:12.600
They’re still not here.

12:12.810 --> 12:13.900
Do you think
something’s happened?

12:16.440 --> 12:18.230
Well, are you gonna tell her
or shall I?

12:19.610 --> 12:20.610
What?

12:21.360 --> 12:23.530
[James] Hotel Bergschaf.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.680
[driver] Home of
the Mountain Sheep.

12:25.880 --> 12:27.700
- Unbelievable!
<i>- </i>This is not what I booked.

12:27.910 --> 12:30.450
Humphrey, it would be literally
insane if that wasn’t the case.

12:30.790 --> 12:31.900
[chickens clucking]

12:32.100 --> 12:33.210
[Diane] Sir...

12:34.080 --> 12:36.440
I’m sorry.
This isn’t our luggage.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.200
This isn’t our hotel.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.880
This isn’t a hotel.

12:40.210 --> 12:41.470
Not your luggage?

12:41.800 --> 12:43.180
Not your hotel?

12:43.380 --> 12:44.590
Not my problem.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.160
[ram bleating]

12:46.360 --> 12:47.960
Excuse me.
Won’t you kindly point me

12:48.150 --> 12:49.390
in the direction
of the manager’s office?

12:50.890 --> 12:51.980
[Diane] Thank you.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.440
I’ll handle this, boys.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.270
[jaunty music]

12:58.980 --> 13:00.230
[bleating]

13:00.860 --> 13:01.940
[knocking]

13:02.860 --> 13:04.200
Hello?

13:05.160 --> 13:06.410
[door creaks]

13:10.620 --> 13:11.950
[bell rings]

13:15.500 --> 13:16.610
Hi. Can I help?

13:16.810 --> 13:17.860
Oh god.

13:18.060 --> 13:19.110
I’m the manager.

13:19.310 --> 13:21.240
You have problems
with your driver?

13:21.440 --> 13:24.330
Yes, yes. Very good. Very droll.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.760
- Also the chef, the gardener
- any problems, you come to me.

13:28.350 --> 13:33.380
This is the Hotel Bergschaf
and we need the Hotel Schafberg!

13:33.570 --> 13:35.090
- Dad...
- Humphrey, stop shouting.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.230
There’s a blizzard on its way.
You stay here tonight.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.760
Humphrey, call the hotel.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.340
Tell them who you are.

13:42.540 --> 13:43.720
They’ll send us a snow truck.

13:43.920 --> 13:44.850
There’s no signal.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.240
Oh, I must say, I like
the sound of a snow truck.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.230
Do you have the internet?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.020
- [James] Christ, Dad!
- Darling, you’re shouting again.

13:52.220 --> 13:56.160
No internet. No signal.
No travelling tonight!

13:56.710 --> 13:59.330
Guys, we will be fine staying
here for one night, I am sure.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.400
Uh...

14:00.600 --> 14:01.570
I for one would like
to go on record

14:01.770 --> 14:02.950
as saying I'm far from sure
about that.

14:03.150 --> 14:04.510
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:04.840 --> 14:06.880
You don’t stay here,
mein Fräulein.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.850
This is my house. Follow me.

14:12.100 --> 14:13.680
[light-hearted music]

14:14.640 --> 14:16.180
- [ram bleating]
- Toilets.

14:17.480 --> 14:18.880
Oh wow!

14:19.080 --> 14:20.090
[bleating]

14:20.290 --> 14:22.400
Jesus! The horns on him!

14:22.610 --> 14:23.630
[owner] Klaus.

14:23.830 --> 14:24.640
Sorry?

14:24.830 --> 14:26.950
His name is Klaus.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.700
This gate remains closed
at all times. Understood?

14:32.950 --> 14:35.080
Well, shouldn’t Klaus
just be tied up?

14:36.370 --> 14:37.710
He was here first.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.630
Maybe it’s you
who should be tied up.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.910
I hope you’re not expecting us
to stay in there?

14:45.100 --> 14:46.630
No, of course not.

14:47.170 --> 14:49.180
This is for my snow plough.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.260
You stay here.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.810
Like it?

15:01.190 --> 15:03.020
I’ve got to learn how to swear
in German.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.530
[bag drops to floor]

15:07.150 --> 15:08.610
Bloody hell.

15:09.950 --> 15:13.270
Oh good. We’re staying
in the Dark Ages.

15:13.470 --> 15:15.480
What’s for dinner?
The bubonic plague?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.910
I’ve slept in worse.

15:17.160 --> 15:17.980
You have?

15:18.180 --> 15:21.330
Only during the war in Dhofar,
mind you.

15:22.790 --> 15:25.740
[James] Well, you have to admit,
it is rather festive.

15:25.940 --> 15:26.780
Mm...

15:26.980 --> 15:29.450
What, no room at the inn,
so we’re staying in a stable?

15:29.650 --> 15:30.450
Exactly.

15:30.650 --> 15:32.840
If only I could locate
three wise men.

15:33.430 --> 15:35.210
I’m sorry, but who on earth

15:35.410 --> 15:37.270
would book to stay
in a place like this?

15:38.600 --> 15:41.480
Now that is flipping gorgeous.

15:43.810 --> 15:45.400
Hey sexy.

15:45.860 --> 15:47.180
Just checking you’ve got to

15:47.380 --> 15:49.220
wherever the hell it is
Dad booked into.

15:49.420 --> 15:50.930
I’m so sorry this has happened.

15:51.130 --> 15:52.970
We’re not saying that
it has actually happened,

15:53.170 --> 15:55.350
but let’s just say,
hypothetically,

15:55.550 --> 15:58.150
there had been a little bit
of a mix-up

15:58.340 --> 16:00.420
and we needed to be
somewhere else tonight,

16:00.620 --> 16:03.750
is there any way that
your transport could sort that?

16:04.040 --> 16:06.650
It pains me to use this word,
<i>gnädige Frau,</i>

16:06.850 --> 16:08.960
but er, the answer is no.

16:09.710 --> 16:13.590
Big snow’s on its way,
so the roads will be closed.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.390
You have a problem?

16:15.600 --> 16:18.000
In that case, no, no.
Not at all.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.130
We just had a little bit
of a mix-up

16:20.320 --> 16:22.230
with the bags at the airport.

16:22.850 --> 16:25.460
And I know that it’s only been
a few hours,

16:25.660 --> 16:27.940
but hey - I miss ya.

16:28.230 --> 16:30.890
Oh and just give us a call when
you get this. Okay?

16:31.090 --> 16:32.700
[giggles] Love you.

16:34.450 --> 16:35.850
Wow.

16:36.050 --> 16:37.450
Beautiful, isn’t it?

16:37.700 --> 16:40.870
Yeah, I’ve never seen
anything like it.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.830
I feel like, erm,
like I’m in a Bond film.

16:44.250 --> 16:45.580
You literally are.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.340
They filmed Spectre
just over there.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.860
Wow!

16:50.060 --> 16:50.860
But if you ask me,

16:51.060 --> 16:52.880
it just wasn’t a patch on
The Spy Who Loved Me.

16:54.340 --> 16:56.040
- I’ve lost you haven’t I?
- Mm, yeah.

16:56.240 --> 16:57.000
Yeah, sorry.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.080
I’ve actually never watched

16:58.280 --> 16:59.560
a Bond film all the way through.

17:00.680 --> 17:02.060
Have I seen you before?

17:02.310 --> 17:04.190
Your face looks very familiar.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.970
Oh, were you at Henley this year
for the Regatta?

17:08.160 --> 17:09.340
Oh, nah.

17:09.540 --> 17:11.300
I’m actually allergic to horses.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.690
[laughs]

17:13.360 --> 17:14.860
Gosh, you’re so funny.

17:16.070 --> 17:17.490
And it’s definitely
your first time here?

17:17.700 --> 17:18.740
Mhm.

17:19.160 --> 17:21.160
It’s me first time
up a mountain.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.330
- What about you?
- God, no.

17:23.790 --> 17:27.960
No, my family have holidayed
here since time immemorial.

17:30.090 --> 17:33.130
But it’s nice to be reminded
not to take it for granted.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.700
Bea...

17:34.900 --> 17:37.410
Taylor... Hayley Taylor.

17:37.610 --> 17:39.890
[laughs] Okay, I see what
you did there.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.140
Well, maybe I’ll see you around
for a drink, Hayley Taylor.

17:44.270 --> 17:46.770
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.230
[speaking German]

18:01.450 --> 18:03.650
And as for your clothes,
do not say another word.

18:03.840 --> 18:05.540
I will have outfits
sent to your room.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.030
I'm an excellent judge of size.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.290
Oh... Danke schön, Gerhard.

18:12.500 --> 18:15.070
Right, nobody is going
anywhere tonight.

18:15.270 --> 18:16.280
Yes!

18:16.480 --> 18:17.580
Uh, uh, uh, uh...

18:17.780 --> 18:19.370
So we just need to stay put

18:19.570 --> 18:21.390
and keep our heads down.
Capiche?

18:22.970 --> 18:24.020
Yeah. Capiche.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.680
[jaunty music]

18:26.430 --> 18:27.500
Cannonball!

18:27.700 --> 18:29.770
- Cannonball!
- Cannonball!

18:30.690 --> 18:31.730
Is that...?

18:32.230 --> 18:33.650
- You are kidding me.
- [Kaye laughs]

18:34.820 --> 18:37.700
- Woo!
- [Kath] Low profile!

18:37.950 --> 18:39.860
I think that ship’s
sailed, love.

18:40.110 --> 18:42.200
- [Kaye laughs]
- [kids shouting]

18:43.410 --> 18:45.080
[heartwarming music]

18:50.380 --> 18:51.540
[door slams shut]

18:54.880 --> 18:57.280
He wasn’t wrong
about that blizzard.

18:57.480 --> 18:58.830
Right then,
if we’re going to stay warm,

18:59.030 --> 19:01.200
we’re going to have to dip into
the Taylor’s suitcases.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.910
Oh, well they’re
a laid-back bunch.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.310
I don’t think they’ll mind.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.680
I might.

19:05.930 --> 19:08.080
- What is she
- a magician’s assistant?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.340
I’ve seen more tasteful outfits
at Cirque Du Soleil.

19:10.540 --> 19:11.710
My darling, trust me,

19:11.910 --> 19:13.380
you would look magic
in anything.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.340
[Diane] Oh, you and that
British charm...

19:15.540 --> 19:17.860
Come on... Something...

19:18.650 --> 19:20.360
Yes! Yes!

19:20.660 --> 19:22.700
[elegant music]

19:23.530 --> 19:24.700
Oh...

19:30.160 --> 19:31.750
Ooh.

19:32.920 --> 19:34.130
[gasps]

19:36.000 --> 19:37.710
[phone ringing]

19:40.880 --> 19:42.490
- James!
- [James] <i>Hayley!</i>

19:42.690 --> 19:44.160
Oh my god.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.710
It’s happened again, hasn’t it?

19:45.910 --> 19:47.420
[James] <i>Put it this way.</i>
<i>I have got...</i>

19:47.620 --> 19:50.140
an incredible sense of déjà vu.

19:50.770 --> 19:52.980
Or whatever that is in German.

19:53.480 --> 19:54.590
[Hayley laughs]

19:54.790 --> 19:56.300
Is it... is it alright
where you are?

19:56.500 --> 19:58.970
Erm... I mean... yeah.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.800
If your definition of alright

20:01.000 --> 20:02.970
includes sleeping
in a mouldy barn

20:03.170 --> 20:04.140
and using toilets that would

20:04.340 --> 20:05.520
make the bogs at
Glastonbury blush.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.830
Are you serious?

20:07.370 --> 20:10.460
Oh my god! I am gonna...
I’m gonna kill my dad!

20:10.710 --> 20:13.940

Hubert James Hughes.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.870
Can I sleep in one of your tops?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.500
[James] Of course.

20:51.870 --> 20:54.120
And can I borrow
your toothbrush?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.840
No, I think the hotel can
provide you with one of those.

20:58.380 --> 21:00.920
Well, you can sleep in my PJs
if you like?

21:01.340 --> 21:03.280

a heart attack

Yes, it’s in my hand luggage.

at me as your mum is.

25:30.690 --> 25:32.590
[sighs] Well, let’s just say

25:32.790 --> 25:33.970
I have found something

25:34.170 --> 25:36.160
very interesting
in James’s washbag.

25:36.780 --> 25:39.530
Okay. And it's, erm...

25:40.580 --> 25:42.230
you know, something you can tell
your old man about

25:42.430 --> 25:43.560
or is it a bit, erm...?

25:43.760 --> 25:44.620
It’s a ring.

25:44.830 --> 25:45.820
I don’t wanna know.

25:46.010 --> 25:47.880
No, Dad, ew!

Does he not know what to get you
for Christmas or something?

25:54.060 --> 25:55.680
I know, right? I literally
told him to get me a Fitbit.

25:56.550 --> 25:58.040
Well, he hasn’t asked
me permission yet,

25:58.240 --> 25:58.950
but if he does,

25:59.150 --> 26:00.910
I’ll tell him the same thing
as the last fella.

26:05.390 --> 26:06.890
that they’re asking
the wrong bloke.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.090

there's a man out there

to marry my daughter.

pretty close, mind.

[light-hearted music]

30:38.120 --> 30:40.460
[romantic music]

30:44.550 --> 30:48.010
James... Oh, what you doing?

30:50.220 --> 30:52.510
Will you, Hayley Taylor,

30:52.760 --> 30:55.470
marry me, James Hughes?

30:56.520 --> 30:58.440
[squeals] Yeah!

30:59.900 --> 31:02.090
[giggles, gasps]

31:02.290 --> 31:03.720
Oh, this is...

31:03.920 --> 31:05.610
Oh, this is such a surprise! Oh!

31:05.990 --> 31:07.530
Oh my gosh, I mean...

31:07.950 --> 31:09.860
Yes... I mean, of course I will!

31:10.740 --> 31:12.310
What? No...

31:12.510 --> 31:13.490
[gasps]

31:14.120 --> 31:15.240
Oh my god!

31:15.740 --> 31:17.370
Oh my god, oh my god,
oh my god!

31:17.790 --> 31:19.460
[dramatic music]

31:23.840 --> 31:25.670
A seminar with James Cameron...

[door creaks]

31:28.720 --> 31:30.220
[dramatic music]

31:30.470 --> 31:31.640
Hello?

31:36.020 --> 31:37.390
Bloody Krampus.

31:38.390 --> 31:39.380

31:39.580 --> 31:40.500

31:44.820 --> 31:46.110
Shit! [gasps]

31:49.700 --> 31:50.530
Shit!

31:57.870 --> 32:00.370
Okay, it’ll be here somewhere.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.290
Okay...

32:06.500 --> 32:08.990
Oh my god, oh my god!

32:09.190 --> 32:10.970
[speaking German]

32:11.930 --> 32:14.260
Erm... a ring?

32:14.510 --> 32:16.330
- Ring?
- [Hayley] <i>Eine, eine </i>ring?

32:16.530 --> 32:18.270
I’ve lost <i>eine </i>ring.

32:18.560 --> 32:19.680
Oh, you lost a ring?

32:19.930 --> 32:22.210
Yes! Si, si, oui... yes, yes.

32:22.410 --> 32:25.260
Erm, like, from,
like there... to here.

32:25.460 --> 32:26.900
Oh, I’ll help you.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.280
Danke schön, very much.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.490
Yes, so...

32:39.450 --> 32:40.750
[groaning]

32:43.120 --> 32:44.920

32:55.390 --> 32:57.350
[suspenseful music]

33:03.350 --> 33:04.520
Klaus?

33:06.400 --> 33:07.230
Klaus?

33:12.190 --> 33:13.070
Klaus!

33:15.820 --> 33:16.740
Klaus...

33:18.620 --> 33:20.330
- [bleating]

33:21.950 --> 33:23.000
Hey, boy.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.830

33:25.330 --> 33:26.420
Okay.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.420
Okay, Klaus.

33:29.670 --> 33:30.960
- [bleating]
- Hey.

33:32.260 --> 33:33.340
[James] Friendly.

33:35.090 --> 33:36.720
Will you please go
into your home?

33:36.930 --> 33:39.260
- [bleating]
- Klaus, er...

33:40.060 --> 33:42.180
Speaken zie English?

33:44.560 --> 33:46.020

33:53.530 --> 33:54.610
- Bloody hell!
- [grunting]

33:54.860 --> 33:56.570
Bloody hell, you’re strong!

33:58.700 --> 33:59.910
[bleating]

34:00.660 --> 34:01.580
Right.

34:02.580 --> 34:03.950
There has to be something.

34:04.290 --> 34:05.460
[gasps] Ooh...

34:06.250 --> 34:07.420
What?

34:08.960 --> 34:09.840
Oh...

34:11.090 --> 34:12.200
Ha.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.420
[bleating]

34:15.630 --> 34:16.970
[sighs]

34:18.970 --> 34:20.390
Oh...

34:22.510 --> 34:23.520
Ooh.

34:27.390 --> 34:29.150
- Fräulein!
- Mm?

34:30.900 --> 34:31.980
Is this what you want?

34:32.230 --> 34:33.380
Yes...

34:33.580 --> 34:34.470
- Yes!
- [man] Yes?

34:34.670 --> 34:36.680
- [Hayley] Yes, yes, yes!
<i>- </i>[man] Ooh...

34:36.880 --> 34:38.700

34:38.990 --> 34:40.390

34:40.590 --> 34:42.120
[Hayley and the man laughing]

34:42.530 --> 34:44.270
[family speaking Italian]

34:44.470 --> 34:45.900
Ooh, mwah, mwah!

34:46.100 --> 34:48.690
Oh, you with
this ring! Brilliant!

34:48.890 --> 34:50.820
[woman] Congratulations!
So romantic.

34:51.020 --> 34:51.940
We took a photo of you.

34:52.140 --> 34:53.420
We thought you’d
really like to...

34:57.050 --> 34:59.050
[laughter]

35:02.510 --> 35:05.520
Hey! Don’t judge me!

35:05.810 --> 35:08.100
- He’s very sexy!
[laughter]

35:08.440 --> 35:10.060
[laughter]

35:10.350 --> 35:12.310
Danke schön, very much.

35:12.730 --> 35:14.070
Ah! [sighs]

35:16.320 --> 35:17.690
Come on...

35:20.450 --> 35:22.030
Oh, how does that smell?

35:22.620 --> 35:23.830
It’s good.

35:25.700 --> 35:26.750
Come on...

35:27.540 --> 35:29.250
Just a little bit further.

35:30.000 --> 35:30.960
[bleating]

35:36.630 --> 35:37.970
[bleating]

36:10.660 --> 36:12.860
[Diane] All I’m saying is
if we’d asked the hotel,

36:13.060 --> 36:15.150
they probably would have sent
a snow truck by now.

36:15.350 --> 36:18.360
Actually, I’m rather taken
with the idea of a snow truck.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.280
- Mm.
- [horn beeps]

36:20.480 --> 36:22.010
[light-hearted music]

36:25.050 --> 36:26.600
Where are we gonna sit?

36:27.100 --> 36:28.350
[bleating]

36:29.390 --> 36:31.310
No. No way. Uh-uh.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.230
Not gonna happen.

36:33.810 --> 36:35.310
[light-hearted music]

36:36.940 --> 36:37.930
[Klaus breaks wind]

36:38.120 --> 36:39.140
Oh god!

36:39.330 --> 36:40.340
Oh, that’s been happening
all morning.

36:40.540 --> 36:41.890
Must be something he ate.

36:42.090 --> 36:43.280
[Jack laughs]

36:44.030 --> 36:46.700
I might throw up.
Oh, that’s terrible.

36:47.120 --> 36:49.330
- Ooh.
- Oh, help me.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.910
Not long now, eh?

36:53.620 --> 36:55.170
Okay. Oh, hooo...

36:59.460 --> 37:01.170
- I'm just gonna...
- Oh.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.640
Morning.

37:06.010 --> 37:07.100
Everything okay?

37:07.470 --> 37:08.810
- Gerard!
- Gerhard.

37:09.560 --> 37:13.100
That was the best breakfast
I have ever had.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.960
Oh, it’s still in the morning
but my day is already a success.

37:16.160 --> 37:16.960
[Geoff laughs]

37:17.160 --> 37:18.470
I just hope you all have
left enough room

37:18.670 --> 37:20.030
for tonight’s Christmas dinner.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.240
Bit early, aren’t you?
It’s still only Christmas Eve.

37:22.440 --> 37:23.820
It’s not early for us.

37:24.110 --> 37:25.560
Here in Tyrol we enjoy
Christmas dinner

37:25.760 --> 37:27.220
late on the evening of the 24th.

37:27.420 --> 37:28.230
Oh.

37:28.420 --> 37:31.410
There will be fireworks
and then a feast.

37:31.830 --> 37:33.400
We can’t have Christmas dinner

37:33.600 --> 37:34.730
the night before
Christmas, Geoff!

37:34.930 --> 37:35.820
I can.

37:36.020 --> 37:37.380
- [Gerhard sighs]
- [Geoff] You heard the boss.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.240
We’ll have to give it a miss,
G man.

37:39.440 --> 37:40.920
You can’t mess with tradition.

37:41.380 --> 37:42.280
It’s a pity.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.240
It’s also custom
to serve and eat

37:44.440 --> 37:46.640
13 different types of dessert.

37:48.930 --> 37:50.460
Although I’ve always said
you should be open

37:50.660 --> 37:52.120
to other people’s traditions.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.880
When in Rome, eh, Grandad?

37:54.080 --> 37:55.460
Book us in Gerry, my boy!

37:55.660 --> 37:58.010
Rome isn’t in Austria,
you know, Geoff.

37:58.200 --> 38:00.720
Christmas dinner on Christmas
Eve? It’s just not right.

38:00.920 --> 38:03.360
Hey, you’ll not end up on
Santa’s naughty list, Kath.

38:03.650 --> 38:05.570
Definitely Italy.

38:05.900 --> 38:07.610
[Grandad] It was on The Chase
the other night.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.910
- Oh! They’re here!
- [Geoff] Hey, oh...

38:10.950 --> 38:11.950
Hiya!

38:13.200 --> 38:14.480
Ey up, Humph!

38:14.680 --> 38:15.940
Dad, he can’t hear ya.

38:16.140 --> 38:17.120
Oh.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.500
[distant grumbling]

38:21.500 --> 38:23.010
They don’t look very happy.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.970
[heartwarming music]

38:25.380 --> 38:27.080
[James] This place
is amazing, Dad!

38:27.280 --> 38:29.790
Oh, it feels so nice
to finally be here.

38:29.990 --> 38:33.310
Well, we can only apologise
for the mix-up caused by my

38:33.560 --> 38:36.000
quite frankly
bellend of a husband.

38:36.200 --> 38:37.130
- Bit harsh.
- [Diane] I'm sorry,

38:37.330 --> 38:38.860
I’m still struggling
with the accent.

38:39.060 --> 38:40.050
What is a bellend?

38:40.250 --> 38:42.050
- Oh! It's the...
- Don’t worry about the mix-up.

38:42.250 --> 38:43.070
These things happen.

38:46.530 --> 38:49.010
Right, well we can,
er, just get our coats

38:49.210 --> 38:50.390
and get out of your hair then.

38:50.590 --> 38:51.520
Oh, thank you.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.690
Oh nonsense.
You can’t leave yet.

38:53.890 --> 38:56.980
No, we can at least get out on
the slopes together first.

38:57.180 --> 38:59.020
That is why we’re here
after all.

38:59.220 --> 39:01.500
Well, er, if we’re doing that,

39:01.790 --> 39:06.490
then we have a little something
for everyone to wear après-ski!

39:06.690 --> 39:07.700
[laughter, cross-talk]

39:07.900 --> 39:09.010
Now, Diane...

39:10.430 --> 39:12.500
I had to go to print before
information of your name

39:12.700 --> 39:13.580
had filtered through to me,

39:13.780 --> 39:14.930
so, er...

39:15.140 --> 39:16.640
I had to improvise.

39:17.020 --> 39:19.480
Well, no... I did tell him
your name.

39:20.230 --> 39:21.800
Well, thank you.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.920
What woman doesn’t dream
of being defined solely

39:24.120 --> 39:25.320
by their relationship
with a man?

39:25.650 --> 39:26.760
You’re welcome.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.400
Right, give us a hand, boys.

39:29.110 --> 39:31.780
- Er, sorry Gilet, er...
- [Ant] Here you go, Hayley.

39:32.490 --> 39:34.870
I’m afraid there’s no
sweatshirt for you.

39:35.160 --> 39:36.540
Oh, really?

39:36.790 --> 39:39.040
There’s this instead! Ha ha!

39:39.330 --> 39:40.960
- Hey hey!
- [cheering]

39:41.290 --> 39:43.500
Aww. That really is a gilet.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.960
Why do they call him Gilet?

39:45.210 --> 39:47.170
Oh, it’s a long story.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.380
When we first met him,
he were wearing a gilet.

39:50.970 --> 39:52.470
So, not that long then.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.620
Right! Er, well, those slaloms
won’t slalom themselves!

39:56.820 --> 39:58.790
Hey hey! Come on then...

39:58.990 --> 39:59.890
Come on, let’s go!

40:00.140 --> 40:01.440
[upbeat music]

40:11.910 --> 40:13.370
I think you’ve got the passes.

40:15.780 --> 40:16.940
[gasps]

40:17.140 --> 40:19.980
Earth to James. The pass...
have you got the passes?

40:20.180 --> 40:22.570
Oh, sorry. Sorry. Here you go.

40:22.770 --> 40:24.330
- Are you alright?
- Yeah, I’m just...

40:24.580 --> 40:26.200
[Hayley] Oh... are you worried
you won’t cut it

40:26.390 --> 40:27.280
as my ski instructor?

40:27.480 --> 40:29.380
[James] [laughs] No, I just...

40:30.130 --> 40:33.550
I need to ask you something
and... when we’re alone.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.470
Hey, well I wouldn’t worry.

40:36.010 --> 40:38.560
I think you’ll get the answer
you’re looking for.

40:41.310 --> 40:43.190
- [Geoff] Right, in we go.
- [Diane] Need help there?

40:43.440 --> 40:45.170
Er, I think we’re gonna
take the next one.

40:45.370 --> 40:48.230
You know, see the views.
Just us two.

40:48.780 --> 40:49.970
Ooh...

40:50.170 --> 40:51.280
Very romantic.

40:51.820 --> 40:52.890
Shut up.

40:53.090 --> 40:54.600
Hey, Gilet!

40:54.800 --> 40:56.370
- [James] Oh!
- [Hayley] No!

40:56.580 --> 40:58.240
Boys! Come on.

40:58.660 --> 40:59.900
- Get in!
- Give us a chance.

41:00.090 --> 41:02.480
You need to get on.
You need to get on, now!

41:02.680 --> 41:04.270
Do you wanna be a shish kebab?
Yeah, I didn’t think so.

41:04.470 --> 41:05.420
[James] Boys, it’s about
to close.

41:05.620 --> 41:06.510
[Geoff] Get in here now!

41:06.710 --> 41:07.880
[crosstalk, bickering]

41:09.000 --> 41:10.260
Mum, tell ‘em!

41:10.460 --> 41:12.590
- Mum, it’s closing!
- Ant...

41:12.880 --> 41:14.240
I guess we’re just gonna
have to go with you.

41:14.440 --> 41:15.760
Oh my god!

41:16.890 --> 41:17.910
[giggling]

41:18.110 --> 41:19.370
[Ant] Hey, Gilet!

41:19.570 --> 41:21.290
Has your face got bigger?
'Cause, like...

41:21.490 --> 41:22.960
It’s even easier to hit
than last year.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.420
I don’t have a big face!

41:24.620 --> 41:25.960
Wait a minute,
did you hear that?

41:26.160 --> 41:27.720
The side of the mountain
just spoke.

41:27.910 --> 41:29.680
- [laughter]
- Come on...

41:29.870 --> 41:30.760
Should have seen
the look on his face!

41:30.960 --> 41:32.510
- Get in.
- [Dec] So easy to wind up.

41:32.710 --> 41:38.370
I think you boys ought to start
being a little nicer to me.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.580
Why would we want to do that?

41:40.790 --> 41:42.560
Yeah. Where’s the fun in that?

41:42.760 --> 41:45.020
Well, I’m going to tell you
a little story.

41:45.220 --> 41:46.210
Boring!

41:46.460 --> 41:50.420
About a Christmas creature
called Krampus.

41:50.750 --> 41:53.050
[sinister music]

41:57.720 --> 41:59.200
[Diane] And that, Geoff,
is how you’ll get

41:59.400 --> 42:01.040
what the ‘F’ you want
from your own business.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.370
- Blimey!
- Mhm.

42:02.570 --> 42:04.380
I don’t think anyone’s floated
an ice cream van

42:04.580 --> 42:06.300
on the stock market before.

42:06.490 --> 42:07.880
It’s an ice cream float, Geoff.

42:08.080 --> 42:09.510
- Hey, hey!
- It’s like I told Elon.

42:09.710 --> 42:11.690
If you ain’t first,
you might as well be dead.

42:11.900 --> 42:12.940
Who?

42:13.150 --> 42:14.950
Elon. Elon Musk.

42:17.320 --> 42:18.780
[speaking German]

42:21.240 --> 42:23.660
Sorry, darling.
I don’t speak a word of German.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.210
[playful music]

42:27.170 --> 42:28.420
After you, James.

42:28.630 --> 42:29.880
Yeah, after you.

42:31.090 --> 42:32.880
That’s very nice of you, boys.

42:34.970 --> 42:36.260
[Hayley giggles]

42:39.430 --> 42:41.000
[Hayley laughs]

42:41.200 --> 42:42.260
Oh...

42:43.060 --> 42:44.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:44.280 --> 42:45.420
- On the side...
- On the side.

42:45.620 --> 42:46.940
And dig in,
lean in to the mountain.

42:47.390 --> 42:48.710
- [Hayley] Lean in...
- [James] Like a crab.

42:48.910 --> 42:50.920
- The mountain is my friend.
- [Humphrey] Ah, here you are!

42:51.120 --> 42:52.050
Wow.

42:52.250 --> 42:54.900
Well, it has been lovely
seeing the views,

42:55.490 --> 42:57.660
but I imagine this is where
we part ways.

42:57.860 --> 43:01.030
The poshoes can go and do
your black runs

43:01.370 --> 43:03.810
and the northerners can go down
to the nursery slopes

43:04.010 --> 43:05.950
for some quality falling over.

43:06.200 --> 43:08.710
Okay, speak for yourself, sis.

43:10.210 --> 43:12.900
Ah, I’m sorry,
but what’s happened here?

43:13.100 --> 43:15.860
Stockport Snow Dome
every Saturday and Sunday

43:16.060 --> 43:18.200
for the past six weeks
is what’s happened here.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.970
Do you remember when Kaye used
to go out with ‘Dry Slope Stu’?

43:21.180 --> 43:23.120
Nothing dry about my slopes,
I can tell you that.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.120
[Geoff sighs]

43:24.320 --> 43:25.620
He gave us a discount.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.520
Yeah. We’re not here
to piste about!

43:28.180 --> 43:29.940
Oh my god, am I the only
one here that can’t ski?

43:30.230 --> 43:31.860
Oh, love, sorry.

43:32.110 --> 43:34.010
Do you know what, you’ll get
the hang of it in no time.

43:34.210 --> 43:37.190
Yeah. Stu says, “It’s just
falling, but with style."

43:37.820 --> 43:39.510
- Hey, don’t worry.
- Oh.

43:39.710 --> 43:40.640
You lot crack on.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.890
We’re just gonna stay up here
and enjoy the view.

43:43.090 --> 43:44.700
- [Hayley] Are you sure?
- [James] Yeah.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.710
Why do they keep looking
at me like that?

43:48.960 --> 43:52.070
Erm, alright! Off you go!
Off you go!

43:52.270 --> 43:54.990
Go and do Stockport
Ski Dome proud.

43:55.190 --> 43:56.760
We will. Right...

43:57.460 --> 43:58.820
Come on, posh knobs!

43:59.020 --> 44:00.160
We’ll race you to the bottom!

44:00.360 --> 44:02.050
Last one down gets the cocoa.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.850
I’ve had the same ski instructor
as Michelle and Barack.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.810
Well, I had Dry Slope Stu.

44:08.060 --> 44:09.230
Literally.

44:09.600 --> 44:10.980
[playful music]

44:11.310 --> 44:13.020
[cheering & laughter]

44:13.480 --> 44:14.860
[Geoff] Here we go!

44:15.440 --> 44:16.400
Go on, Mum!

44:16.940 --> 44:19.530
[Kath] Thanks!
See you at the bottom!

44:20.530 --> 44:21.820
Have fun!

44:23.200 --> 44:26.030
Come on. Let’s go find
somewhere perfect.

44:27.120 --> 44:28.200
Okay.

44:29.160 --> 44:30.330
Come on, yeah...

Well...

45:18.630 --> 45:19.960
it's...

45:20.630 --> 45:22.910
about our future, I guess.

45:23.110 --> 45:23.910
- Mm.
- About...

45:24.110 --> 45:25.470
what we’re doing
after graduation.

45:25.720 --> 45:26.760
Yeah?

45:27.800 --> 45:30.750
I am just having the most
amazing time with you, Hayley.

45:30.950 --> 45:32.130
- And I always imagined...
- One minute.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.310
One minute.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.980
- What are you doing?
- One minute.

45:38.230 --> 45:39.730
- You alright?
- Mhm.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.740
Mhm. Alright.

45:42.940 --> 45:44.700
Okay, okay.

45:44.990 --> 45:45.890
Are you alright?

45:46.090 --> 45:47.560
Okay, I'm ready.

45:47.760 --> 45:48.910
- Okay, erm...
- Carry on.

45:49.950 --> 45:52.620
Um... Okay, er...

45:53.000 --> 45:54.610
- [tender music]
- Yeah, I am...

45:54.810 --> 45:56.320
having the best time with you.

45:56.520 --> 45:58.330
London has been amazing, and...

45:58.750 --> 46:00.990
and just whenever
I think about the future,

46:01.190 --> 46:03.450
I picture us being together.

46:03.650 --> 46:05.050
Yeah, me too.

46:06.590 --> 46:07.800
Okay, well...

46:09.600 --> 46:11.930
what if I were to ask you...

46:12.770 --> 46:13.810
Huby Hughes?

46:14.140 --> 46:17.050
Huby-Hu?
Are you kidding me?

46:17.240 --> 46:18.800
Huby Hughes... is that you?

46:19.000 --> 46:20.550
Ah! No!

46:20.750 --> 46:21.840
- Beattie Edrington!
- I do not believe this!

46:22.040 --> 46:23.030
- Oh my god!
- [Bea squeals]

46:23.360 --> 46:25.400
- [James] As I live and breathe.
- Wait... what’s happening?

46:26.860 --> 46:28.430
- How long has it been?
- I don't know...

46:28.630 --> 46:29.450
- seven, eight years?
- No.

46:29.780 --> 46:31.990
Oh god, we are so old.
How bleak.

46:32.370 --> 46:35.120
Oh... 007.

46:35.370 --> 46:37.000
I was not expecting you.

46:37.420 --> 46:38.500
Oh my god.

46:39.130 --> 46:41.190
Of course! I knew
I’d seen you before.

46:41.390 --> 46:42.530
You’re in his profile pic.

46:42.730 --> 46:44.410
This is Hayley. Hang on,
do you guys already...

46:44.610 --> 46:46.720
No, we met last night.
Very briefly.

46:47.180 --> 46:48.200
No way.

46:48.400 --> 46:49.830
My two favourite people
in the world.

46:50.030 --> 46:50.790
What are the chances?

46:50.990 --> 46:52.080
Yeah. What are the chances?

46:52.280 --> 46:53.460
[James] Erm, sorry, er,

46:53.660 --> 46:55.630
Bea lived like ten minutes
down the road from us.

46:55.830 --> 46:57.250
Er, well, 20 if you
take into account

46:57.450 --> 46:58.390
the length of your drive.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.420
Shut up. We grew up together,
you know.

47:00.620 --> 47:01.440
We summered together.

47:01.940 --> 47:04.440
Ah, gosh, I can’t believe
you two are together.

47:04.820 --> 47:06.280
There goes our deal.

47:07.570 --> 47:10.950
Yep. So, we had a deal where

47:11.150 --> 47:12.750
if we both ended up single,

47:12.950 --> 47:14.480
- we’d get married.
- Ah!

47:14.680 --> 47:16.310
- You’re my, er, Huby-Hubby.
- Yes.

47:16.510 --> 47:18.020
- And I was your...
- Bride-to-Bea!

47:18.220 --> 47:19.400
- [laughter]
- We were so funny.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.750
So funny...

47:21.540 --> 47:23.130
Hey, erm...

47:23.500 --> 47:25.550
I was so sorry to hear
about your mum.

47:26.340 --> 47:27.670
Ah, no. I mean...

47:28.170 --> 47:29.380
- Hey.
- Oh.

47:29.930 --> 47:30.970
Aww.

47:32.100 --> 47:33.040
[hugging]

47:33.240 --> 47:34.640
- Aww.
- Mm.

47:35.890 --> 47:37.540
So... what’s going on?

47:37.740 --> 47:38.590
Are you here with all the fam?

47:38.780 --> 47:40.630
Ah, gosh. Not this time, no.

47:40.830 --> 47:43.130
- I’m on a one-woman retreat.
- Ooh.

47:43.330 --> 47:46.050
I’m laying low after
a particularly spicy break-up.

47:46.250 --> 47:47.860
- Ah. Sorry to hear that.
- Oh.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.650
Yeah, thanks.

47:50.360 --> 47:51.490
It was just one of those things.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.030
There was faults on both sides.

47:53.580 --> 47:55.370
I found out he didn’t
like David Bowie,

47:55.580 --> 47:57.270
and he found out that I’d slept
with his sister, so...

47:57.470 --> 47:59.210
Ah! Classic Bea.

47:59.460 --> 48:00.610
Classic Bea, right.

48:00.810 --> 48:02.690
[scoffs] Ah, gosh.

48:02.890 --> 48:04.570
Anyway, I should, er,
I should leave you guys to it.

48:04.770 --> 48:06.420
I don’t want to intrude
on your day out.

48:06.800 --> 48:08.990
Erm, well, I mean,
if you’re here by yourself,

48:09.190 --> 48:11.470
then you should just
hang with us, right?

48:12.180 --> 48:13.800
I mean, we were just
having a chat, so...

48:14.260 --> 48:17.180
I mean, if it was important,
I... I can go.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.420
We can just talk
about it later. Right, H?

48:19.620 --> 48:20.630
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

48:20.830 --> 48:21.750
- Okay?
- Totally.

48:21.950 --> 48:23.590
- Yay!
- Okay, great! Aha!

48:23.790 --> 48:26.840
Erm, well I was going to go
and ski 'The Gauntlet',

48:27.040 --> 48:28.240
if it interests you.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.680
Oh, it’s a goodie.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.850
Er, well... this one’s actually
never been down there...

48:32.050 --> 48:33.310
No, this one would be
up for that.

48:33.510 --> 48:34.320
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

48:34.950 --> 48:36.270
Well, Hayley, I just think you
should probably start

48:36.470 --> 48:37.730
on a little more...

48:37.930 --> 48:39.690
I think I can handle
‘The Gauntlet’.

48:39.890 --> 48:42.020
Yeah, come on Huby.
Let the girl ski.

48:42.220 --> 48:43.650
Yeah, come on, Huby.

48:43.850 --> 48:45.670
I can look after myself, hm?

48:46.500 --> 48:50.090
After all, what’s skiing if not
falling with style, right?

48:50.470 --> 48:51.280
[giggles]

48:51.480 --> 48:52.970
[dramatic music]

48:56.010 --> 48:57.010
It’s quite steep.

48:57.510 --> 48:59.850
Nah. It’s a red
but it skis like a blue.

49:00.350 --> 49:03.270
Yeah! Yeah, James, it’s a red
but it skis like a blue.

49:03.770 --> 49:05.050
You don’t know what
any of that means.

49:05.250 --> 49:09.090
I think I know how to get down
a ski slope! [laughs]

49:09.290 --> 49:13.110
You just, you know, you point
your skis down, and...

49:13.860 --> 49:15.180
you let gravity do the rest!

49:15.380 --> 49:18.790
Well, no, it’s a lot more
complicated than that, Hayley.

49:18.990 --> 49:20.270
Here we go...

49:20.470 --> 49:21.810
You really need to lean
forwards into your skis...

49:22.010 --> 49:22.980
- [Hayley] Oh my god!
- And then...

49:23.180 --> 49:24.270
- Oh my god!
- Hayley...

49:24.470 --> 49:26.690
Oh my god, James! James!

49:26.890 --> 49:28.110
She knows how to turn, right?

49:28.310 --> 49:29.860
I don’t think she knows
how to turn.

49:30.060 --> 49:30.860
[Hayley screaming]

49:31.060 --> 49:32.070
But she knows how to stop?

49:32.270 --> 49:33.090
[Hayley shrieking]

49:34.260 --> 49:35.470
I don’t think she knows
how to stop.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.550
[sighing heavily]

49:38.430 --> 49:39.470
Ugh!

49:39.680 --> 49:40.520
[zipping]

49:42.100 --> 49:44.290
I’m sorry, but a skier
of her standard

49:44.490 --> 49:46.130
simply does not belong
on a slope like this.

49:46.330 --> 49:48.630
Oh, that was totally my fault.
I brought her up here.

49:48.830 --> 49:50.900
Don’t worry. We can just get
a cable car down.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.050
No, please.
Don’t let me hold you back.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.260
- You two just carry on.
- No, no way.

49:54.460 --> 49:55.200
You’ve taken a knock.

49:55.400 --> 49:56.740
No, James, I’m fine.

49:57.070 --> 49:58.270
[sighs] And, erm...

49:58.470 --> 50:00.350
You can get me back
to the cable car, right?

50:00.550 --> 50:01.560
Of course.

50:01.760 --> 50:02.950
Hey, I want to go down with you.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.000
No. Please, please...
It was just a little tumble.

50:05.210 --> 50:08.130
And I’m embarrassed more
than anything, so...

50:08.790 --> 50:10.740
Bea, take him away!

50:10.940 --> 50:12.210
Only if you’re sure.

50:12.460 --> 50:13.340
Yeah.

50:13.630 --> 50:15.130
Yeah, I’ll meet you
back at base.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.390
- Go on! Go!
- Okay.

50:18.970 --> 50:20.100
No more skiing.

50:20.640 --> 50:22.890
- Promise?
- Promise.

Yeah, yeah, erm...

52:17.170 --> 52:19.200
- I just took a small tumble.
- Oh.

52:19.400 --> 52:21.260
So I’m feeling a bit bruised.

52:22.050 --> 52:25.790
I’m not sure skiing is my sort
of thing, to be honest.

52:25.990 --> 52:27.100
Yeah.

52:27.810 --> 52:29.500
What about you?
Did you have fun?

52:29.700 --> 52:31.210
Yeah. I don’t really get
what all the fuss is about

52:31.410 --> 52:32.250
either, you know?

52:32.450 --> 52:34.170
All that palaver to get
to the top of an hill

52:34.370 --> 52:35.770
to turn round and come
straight back down again?

52:36.070 --> 52:37.110

Give me ten-pin bowling or Laser

[laughter]

52:43.410 --> 52:44.410
[sighs]

52:46.030 --> 52:48.200
I know it seems mad being
somewhere like this, but...

52:49.410 --> 52:53.040
Oh, I would give anything to be
in Macclesfield right now.

52:53.330 --> 52:54.820
It just don’t feel
like Christmas

52:55.020 --> 52:55.820
when we’re not at home.

52:56.020 --> 52:58.380
That doesn’t sound mad at all.

52:59.460 --> 53:00.970
- [knocking]
- Knock knock.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.380
- You okay?
- Mhm.

53:04.510 --> 53:06.390
Okay. Yeah...

53:06.850 --> 53:08.310
Mwah. Oh...

53:08.510 --> 53:10.060
I’ll leave you to it, Gilet.

53:12.690 --> 53:13.900
[Hayley clears her throat]

53:15.440 --> 53:17.570
- You made it down alright?
- Mhm.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.510
How are you feeling?

53:19.710 --> 53:20.800
Oh, why does everyone
keep asking me that?

53:21.000 --> 53:21.820
It was just a tumble.

53:23.610 --> 53:24.490
Okay.

53:29.290 --> 53:30.200
Sorry.

53:30.830 --> 53:31.790
Sorry...

53:32.370 --> 53:34.210
[sighs] I was just, er...

53:34.710 --> 53:36.070
I was just chatting with Mum

53:36.270 --> 53:39.050
and I think that she’s missing
her Christmas at home.

53:39.920 --> 53:42.380
And I am too,
to be honest.

53:47.350 --> 53:49.350
I think I know something
we can do about that.

53:49.560 --> 53:50.710
[tender music]

53:50.910 --> 53:53.100
- Come on.
- [Hayley laughs]

53:58.150 --> 53:59.610
[James sighs]

54:03.360 --> 54:07.240
Now it’s finally
just the two of us,

54:07.910 --> 54:09.430
- I think...
- Mhm.

54:09.630 --> 54:12.370
- you’re overdue a little TLC.
- Oh, oui!

54:12.620 --> 54:13.730
[Hayley laughs]

54:13.930 --> 54:16.940
And maybe I can even kiss some
of those bruises a bit better.

54:17.140 --> 54:18.540
- Mm.
- Mm.

54:19.170 --> 54:20.130
Aah!

54:20.880 --> 54:22.210
- Ow!
- Argh!

54:22.460 --> 54:25.130
Gramps! Why?

54:25.380 --> 54:27.510
Terrific water pressure
in there.

54:28.800 --> 54:31.430
Don’t mind me,
I’m going back in.

54:32.810 --> 54:34.140
- Ah...
- [laughter]

54:35.520 --> 54:36.710
Oh well...

54:36.910 --> 54:39.900
I suppose it is a bit like
a Christmas back at home.

54:42.480 --> 54:43.570
Wait, that’s it!

54:44.570 --> 54:45.530
What?

54:45.860 --> 54:48.320
Well, if you guys are really
missing Christmas at home,

54:48.700 --> 54:52.370
why don’t we bring a bit of
Macclesfield Christmas here?

54:53.330 --> 54:54.200
Huh?

54:54.500 --> 54:55.450
Aah.

54:55.750 --> 54:57.790
Oh Diane, did you not
fancy the jumper?

54:58.290 --> 55:00.360
If my stylist caught me wearing
yellow out of season,

55:00.560 --> 55:02.170
- he’d put a bullet in my head.
- [Humphrey chuckles]

55:02.420 --> 55:03.340
And rightly so.

55:03.710 --> 55:06.870
Right, what we doing
between now and dinner?

55:07.070 --> 55:09.450
I can’t stop thinking about
them 13 desserts!

55:09.650 --> 55:12.210
What do you think those desserts
are going to be, Geoff?

55:12.400 --> 55:14.330
I mean, we can get out
of your way if you’d prefer?

55:14.530 --> 55:15.500
No, not at all.

55:15.700 --> 55:18.460
You’ve got your Christmas
pudding, Christmas cake...

55:18.660 --> 55:20.590
Well, no 13 desserts
for us, dear.

55:20.790 --> 55:22.800
We’ve got the same
nutritionist as Tom.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.180
She is unrelenting.

55:24.370 --> 55:27.280
Your apple pie, your cherry pie,
your blackberry pie...

55:27.530 --> 55:29.660
I thought you lot would be
chopping cucumbers by now.

55:30.200 --> 55:31.270
You what?

55:31.470 --> 55:32.780
Well, it’s Christmas Eve.

55:33.240 --> 55:34.980
Just 'cause we’re here
doesn’t mean you have to stop

55:35.180 --> 55:36.440
with your Christmas traditions.

55:36.640 --> 55:37.960
- What, you mean...?
- Boys to the pub.

55:38.460 --> 55:39.920
Girls have a pamper!

55:40.250 --> 55:43.210
Gilet, you flipping genius!

55:43.460 --> 55:44.610
We do it every year.

55:44.810 --> 55:46.780
Boys go to the pub,
girls have a pamper.

55:46.980 --> 55:47.930
So I gathered.

55:48.130 --> 55:48.990
And I don’t care
what anyone says,

55:49.190 --> 55:50.160
I’m going to the pub
this year.

55:50.360 --> 55:51.580
- Good lad!
- Ah, boo!

55:51.780 --> 55:52.910
Ah, Gilet! It'll not be the same
without you.

55:53.110 --> 55:55.040
Sticky toffee pudding,
lemon meringue...

55:55.240 --> 55:57.290
Can someone try switching
him off and on again?

55:57.490 --> 55:58.630
[laughter]

55:58.830 --> 56:01.050
Er, I was thinking,
since it is Christmas,

56:01.250 --> 56:04.980
perhaps I might indulge in just
the one gin and slim.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.260
Well, just remember what our
nutritionist always says...

56:08.460 --> 56:09.530
- What would Tom do?
- Tom.

56:09.820 --> 56:10.640
Tom Jones?

56:10.840 --> 56:13.060
[gasps] Ooh...
What about the boys?

56:13.260 --> 56:14.480
Oh, don’t worry about us.

56:14.680 --> 56:16.600
We can just, you know,
stay here and watch a film.

56:16.800 --> 56:19.440
Yeah, maybe order a bit of room
service if we get hungry.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.520
There you go!

56:20.720 --> 56:22.820
Cor, it’s feeling more
like Christmas now!

56:23.020 --> 56:24.440
- In't it? Eh?
- [laughter]

56:24.640 --> 56:26.200
You’re the best.
Do you know that?

56:26.400 --> 56:27.840
[Grandad] Have I said
Christmas cake?

56:28.090 --> 56:28.990
Come on girls...

56:29.190 --> 56:31.240
Let’s order up some cucumbers
and Prosecco!

56:31.440 --> 56:32.700
Kaye, my dear.

56:32.900 --> 56:35.000
We are residing in
five-star accommodation

56:35.200 --> 56:36.120
in the middle of the Alps.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.120
I think we can do a little
better than that.

56:38.320 --> 56:39.080
Shall we?

56:39.280 --> 56:40.430
Come on, Diane.

56:40.640 --> 56:41.980
- [laughter]
- [light-hearted music]

56:42.190 --> 56:43.210
- [Geoff] Drink up, Humph.
- Come on girls.

56:43.410 --> 56:45.020
The pub waits for no man.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.400
Oh, this is the place!

56:50.740 --> 56:52.740
Eh... 'Die Hundehütte'.

56:53.200 --> 56:54.280
[pub chatter]

56:55.320 --> 56:56.700
[Geoff] Hohoho.

56:57.490 --> 56:58.540
This’ll do, eh?

56:58.740 --> 56:59.830
Here we go.

57:02.330 --> 57:04.170
- Cheers lads, eh?
- Cheers!

57:04.420 --> 57:06.030
To the 'Hundehütte'.

57:06.230 --> 57:08.570
Merry Christmas! Good health
and all the above.

[cheering]

57:10.380 --> 57:11.910
[Geoff laughing]

57:12.110 --> 57:13.800
It’s a bit rowdy in here, Humph.

57:14.050 --> 57:16.000
We need another team
for the next round.

57:16.200 --> 57:17.040
What about you?

57:17.240 --> 57:18.960
Guys in the yellow,
come on, come on.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.630
Have a little
drinking competition.

57:20.820 --> 57:22.670
Oh no. We just want one
quiet pint. That’s it.

57:22.870 --> 57:24.880
You have an English accent.
English, huh?

57:25.080 --> 57:27.610
Come on. Don’t be a coward.
[chicken sounds]

57:28.320 --> 57:30.640
We’re not having...
No, we can’t do that. It’s...

57:30.830 --> 57:31.720
[James] A bad idea.

57:31.920 --> 57:33.150
[MC] Do it for Churchill!

57:33.780 --> 57:34.810
- Yes?
- No.

- Do it for Paddington!
- Come on!

all over again.

- Yeah.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:11.310
I’ve been in that one before.
Plenty of times.

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:12.940
I needed that.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.090
Better out than in, eh, lad?

01:00:16.290 --> 01:00:17.110
Mm.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.220
Where’s Dad and Gramps gone?

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.490
They’ve gone outside
for a cigar.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.810
Bloody hell...
They must be drunk.

01:00:26.010 --> 01:00:28.290
[giggling] It was all worth
it though, eh?

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:30.750
Hello, excuse me.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.860
Hi. Could we, er, have five
really small coffees, please?

01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.420
- Funk.
- Thank you.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:40.840
- Danke.
- Is it funk or is it...?

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.300
Listen...

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.790
It’s good to spend some time
with you, mate, you know?

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.210
- Mm.
- Mano a mano. And listen...

01:00:50.410 --> 01:00:51.480
Yeah.

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.270
I know what it is
you’re waiting to ask me.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.930
And I’m gonna save you ever
having to do it,

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:00.090
‘cause I know it’s awkward.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.280
What?

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:04.280
H knows you’re going to pop
the question for Christmas.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.890
She told me.

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:08.830
She’s well excited, mate.

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.520
I’ll be honest, so am I.
I mean, we all are.

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.690
We’re all just waiting
for it to happen now, look,

01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.320
so there’s no need to stress.

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.380
- Um...
- Do. Not. Stress.

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:19.960
Hayley’s...
Hayley told you that?

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:21.870
So when’s it gonna happen?

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:23.590
No, no, no, don’t tell me.
No, no...

01:01:24.050 --> 01:01:25.540
Tonight, hey?

01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.370
At midnight!
I mean, it is perfect!

01:01:27.570 --> 01:01:28.760
We’re at the fireworks.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.600
No, in fact don’t tell me.

01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:33.230
It’ll be more of a surprise.

Now that is what I call
a pamper.

Oh, you just can’t beat
a Christmas tradition.

- Diane, I’ve got to ask you.
- Mm?

01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:10.430
How do you manage to retain
that lovely figure?

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:12.270
Well, thank you, Kaye.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.310
Three things, all in my book.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.840
Have I told you it's
a New York Times...

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.130
A New York Times
Bestseller? Yeah.

01:02:17.330 --> 01:02:18.710
Yeah, Diane, you have.
A few times.

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:19.760
Okay, good.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:20.860
So, three things.

01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:24.050
First off: no carbs, no dairy,
no alcohol.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:25.550
No flippin’ chance!

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:29.100
Secondly, I use the same
colonic guy as Angelina.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.830
- Really?
- And most importantly, no kids.

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:33.560
[Kaye] I knew it!

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.690
I honestly know I wouldn’t be
who I am today

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.250
if I had lost all of that time
and energy raising children.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.460
Instead, I chose
to raise myself.

01:02:41.590 --> 01:02:43.210
[Kaye] Do you know what Diane,

01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:45.800
you have just sold yourself
another book.

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:47.200
Thank you, Kaye.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.760
And as it’s for you,

01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:50.600
- I’ll sign it for free.
- Aww.

01:02:50.850 --> 01:02:53.040
The thing is, Diane, there’s
actually a counter to that,

01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:53.960
isn’t there?

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.880
Because I wouldn’t be the woman
that I am today

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.460
if I hadn’t have put all
that time and energy

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.260

- Aww.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:02.070

she’s become

is the thing that nourishes
me now.

- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:08.260

been the same since,

But you haven’t got a ring?

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:32.710
Well, it’s not about
the ring though.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.100
It’s about you and me.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.060
What about the washbag?

01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:38.150
What washbag?

01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:41.440
Oh my god.

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.650
H.J.H.

01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:46.100
They’re your Dad’s initials
as well.

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.810
- Yeah.
- Oh...

01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:49.430
It wasn’t yours.

01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:50.980
It was never yours.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:52.620
Oh my god, you were never
going to ask me!

01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:56.540
I was. I’ve always wanted
to ask you, Hayley.

01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:58.440
And I am asking you now.

01:10:58.640 --> 01:10:59.830
No, not really.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.320
Right now you’re just...

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:04.030
just a drunk man with
a souvenir keyring.

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.380
No, I’m not drunk.

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:07.050
I’ve had five tiny coffees.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.300
I don’t know what
to believe anymore.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.180
And I have got you...

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:12.640
a present.

01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:14.890
And I wanted to give it to you
at the fireworks.

01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.390
Are you moving to L.A.?

01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:20.860
What?

01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.720
Are you going to film school
in L.A.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.320
and you haven’t told me?

01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:28.030
No...

01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:30.890
I’ve been really trying
to tell you

01:11:31.090 --> 01:11:32.620
- and I wanted to talk...
- Are you going or not?

01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:34.290
No. No, I'm...

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:36.160
Maybe.

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:38.830
I don’t know.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.650
But you could... come with me.

01:11:42.850 --> 01:11:45.010
How? I can’t just move to L.A.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.970
Yeah, but you could.

01:11:47.470 --> 01:11:49.330
And we’d make it work.
And I would sort it.

01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:50.970
I don’t want you to sort it.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.290
- I’m not a charity case, James.
- I know.

01:11:53.490 --> 01:11:55.020
- And I have got plans of my own,
- I know.

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.380
thank you very much.

01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:57.500
In my world,

01:11:57.700 --> 01:12:00.480
people don’t get everything
handed to them on a plate.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.900
You do.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:03.110
She does.

01:12:03.310 --> 01:12:05.680
So yeah, maybe that is why
you two fit together.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.930
Okay, please stop worrying
about Bea.

01:12:08.130 --> 01:12:09.300
She’s into you if anything.

01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:10.760
No, no. This isn’t about Bea.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.390
This is about me and you,

01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:14.350
and what happens outside
of the bubble

01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:16.210
that we’ve created
for ourselves.

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.810
Because outside of that bubble

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:19.730
are two completely
separate worlds.

01:12:19.930 --> 01:12:21.400
- I know.
- One that you live in,

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.710
and one that I do.

01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:24.820
Ski slopes and...

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:26.250
and Laser Quest.

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.870
And I know, if it isn’t Bea,

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:31.490
it will be someone else
down the line.

01:12:31.690 --> 01:12:34.540
It will be a Celeste or a Freya
or a Veronica...

01:12:34.740 --> 01:12:36.080
[James] Hayley,
what are you talking about?

01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.140
Someone from your world
who can just go to L.A.

01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:40.130
Someone that you can
“summer” with.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:43.170
Someone that can, that can
ski the flippin’ Gauntlet!

01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:44.970
I am not that person!

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.590
And I never wanna be
that person!

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:48.340
I’ve never asked you
to be that person.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.850
I’ve never asked you
to be that person!

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:50.970
- Oh, just don't...
- Hayley!

01:12:51.170 --> 01:12:52.240
No... Leave me alone!

01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:55.280

see you anymore.

It’s somet else,
all this up here.

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:18.320
What did he just say?

01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:19.790
Look, I was thinking,

01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:21.810
you lot should stay
in the apartment tonight.

01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:24.060
We can easily double up
and make room.

01:14:24.260 --> 01:14:25.130
It's no trouble.

Erm, sure!

01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:34.340
It’ll be just like being
in a dorm back at college,

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:38.890
Well, we can go if you prefer?

No. Not at all.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.890
I just think that maybe there’s
a lesson to be learnt here.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.900
Oh?

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.460
That you should never be
too proud

Do you know what,
sometimes Diane,

01:14:52.290 --> 01:14:53.430
I don’t think your hot takes

01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.260
are as refreshing
as you think they are.

01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:57.450
[scoffs] Not what the
New York Times said.

Look, the point Diane
is trying to make

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:03.650
is if you’d let me go ahead and
sort out the whole booking,

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.620
then a lot of this fuss could
have been avoided. That’s all.

01:20:25.570 --> 01:20:28.570
Oh... Ugh...

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:31.490
Oh, come on now.
Try and get some sleep.

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:34.980
I always knew this day
would happen.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:36.950
I just don’t belong
in his world.

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:39.690
And if we had got married,

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:41.190
that is where I would have
ended up.

01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:42.780
And I just don’t,

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.740
I do not wanna spend
the rest of my life

01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:48.550
being the exception in the room.
I don’t.

01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:51.760
You don’t have to worry
about that now.

01:20:52.090 --> 01:20:54.010
And we are going home tomorrow.

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.770
Alright?

01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:59.980
[kiss] Night night, love.

01:21:00.310 --> 01:21:01.560
Night night.

01:21:10.150 --> 01:21:11.570
[Hayley sighs]

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:28.500
[Gerhard speaking German]

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.830
Good morning.
Everything is okay?

01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:37.260
Ja, danke.

01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:39.540
I am sorry that you
do not appear

01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.270
to be very hungry this morning.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.590
I must admit things
are certainly

01:21:43.790 --> 01:21:45.420
a little bit quieter
around here

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.320
without the rest of your party.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.780
I miss the noise.

01:21:54.240 --> 01:21:56.530
- [horn honking]
- Boys!

01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:59.950
- [horn honking]
- Boys!

01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:02.040
[upbeat music]

01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:15.180
I don’t believe it.
A snow truck!

01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:20.890
Well, you getting in or not?

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.810
But where are we going?

01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.940
We’re going to get you
what the ‘F’ you want.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.940
[Diane] Come on! This’ll get us
there in no time.

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:36.860
Mind the...
That’s it, I’ve got you.

01:22:37.570 --> 01:22:38.950
Right, uh...

01:22:39.530 --> 01:22:40.620
[engine revs]

01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:45.960
[triumphant music]

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.430
Hayley!

01:22:57.890 --> 01:22:59.180
Hayley?

01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:03.850
Hayley!

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.100
[bleating]

01:23:08.060 --> 01:23:10.440
You are already too late.

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:13.730
[sombre music]

01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:29.320
Right, close it like that.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.670
You can open it like that...

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.300
- [Geoff sighs]
- Isn’t there usually a TV?

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.790
Right, we’ll get home,

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:46.210
make a brew, stick on a film.

01:23:46.410 --> 01:23:48.380
- The Sound of Music?
- Absolutely not.

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.230
Muppet’s Christmas Carol.

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.760
And then tomorrow,

01:23:51.960 --> 01:23:54.490
we’re doing Christmas Day
all over again, properly.

01:23:54.690 --> 01:23:56.840
None of that five-star rubbish.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.310
And then we never,
ever have to have a Christmas

01:23:59.510 --> 01:24:01.430
away from home again. Ever.

01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:04.200
- Leave means leave!
- No, it’s not about that, boys.

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:06.410
Here, do they think they’re
still serving breakfast?

01:24:06.620 --> 01:24:07.730
[Kaye] You’ve just eaten.

01:24:07.930 --> 01:24:09.400
- [laughter]
- Well, I’m hungry.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.000
[announcement in German]

01:24:11.210 --> 01:24:12.670
[Grandad] My whole life,

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:15.630
people tried to tell me
where I belong.

01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.840
When we got married,

01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:23.100
they’d tell your Grandma and me
we didn’t belong together.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.750
And even after many years,

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:28.670
there were still some people
in power

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:31.650
trying to tell me if I belong.

01:24:33.650 --> 01:24:36.400
One thing I’ve come to know
is this:

01:24:38.190 --> 01:24:43.160
You are the only person
in this life

01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:47.290
who gets to decide
where you belong.

01:24:49.210 --> 01:24:52.290
Now, I’m not gonna be here
much longer

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:55.540
and I have made my peace
with that,

01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:57.920
so when I’m gone,

01:24:58.130 --> 01:25:00.420
you remember this for me.

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:04.640
Wherever you get yourself
in life,

01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.520
that’s where you belong.

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.390
And if you are the exception
in the room, child,

01:25:12.650 --> 01:25:15.440
it is because you
are exceptional.

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.820
Do you understand me?

01:25:28.040 --> 01:25:29.310
Grandad, I...

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:30.790
[snoring]

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:37.750
[beep]

01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.050
[uplifting music]

01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:35.170
[flight attendant] <i>On behalf</i>
<i>of Captain Miller and the crew,</i>

01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:37.310
<i>we would like to wish you</i>
<i>a pleasant flight.</i>

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:39.220
[jet engines revving]

01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:41.320
[flight attendant speaking
in German]

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:43.650
Erm... excuse me?

01:26:44.070 --> 01:26:45.150
Excuse me!

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.160
I, I need to get off this plane!

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.230
- [Geoff] Eh?
- Excuse me, Fräulein,

01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:51.190
the plane is about to take off.
Please take your seat.

01:26:51.380 --> 01:26:52.810
No, no, it can’t take off,
'cause I need to get off!

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:53.860
Hayley!

01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:55.330
We have taxied and
we’re preparing for take-off.

01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:56.360
Can we just stop the plane, now?

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.400
It’s a hijacking!

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.190
This plane will not stop.

01:26:59.390 --> 01:27:01.000
[brakes screeching]

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:04.630
[captain] <i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we apologise for the delay.</i>

01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:07.090
<i>On the runway ahead of us</i>
<i>there appears to be an...</i>

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:09.050
<i>obstruction.</i>

01:27:09.550 --> 01:27:11.180
[triumphant music]

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.390
- [bleating]
- Here boy!

01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:15.960
[gasps] Do you want more?

01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.310
[bleating]

01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:19.810
Stay there, Klausie.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:22.650
[kissing]

01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:34.040
- You flippin’ lunatic!
- [James laughs]

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.960
What were you doing back there?

01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:39.830
Ever since we got here,
I have been wanting to kiss you.

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.900
And I guess I couldn’t
let you go

01:27:42.100 --> 01:27:43.590
without giving it another try.

01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:45.420
[Hayley laughs]

01:27:45.800 --> 01:27:47.630
I know you said we’re
from different worlds,

01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:49.550
and you’re right.

01:27:50.390 --> 01:27:51.450
But the only world
I wanna live in

01:27:51.650 --> 01:27:53.180
is the one where we get
to be together.

01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:55.060
And if that means

01:27:55.850 --> 01:27:58.230
we have to build our own,
then that’s what we’ll do.

01:27:59.810 --> 01:28:01.440
We are meant to be,
you know that?

01:28:02.730 --> 01:28:03.610
[Hayley gasps]

01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:06.050
A very wise man once told me,

01:28:06.250 --> 01:28:08.280
"when you know, you know."

01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:11.660
And I think I’ve known since
the first moment that I met ya.

01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:12.810
Now...

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:16.000
stop talking and kiss me.

01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.480
[triumphant music]

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.580
- Hey, hey, hey!
- [clapping]

01:28:22.250 --> 01:28:23.090
Hey!

01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:25.630
Hey, hey, hey...

01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:26.660
we need to go now.

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:28.420
My brother’s shift
is going to end.

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:31.890
Come on...

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.800
Come on!

01:28:36.930 --> 01:28:38.890
- [Kath] Aww!
- [kissing]

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.770
[Geoff] Put me daughter down!

01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:43.510
Geoff, go get the bags.

01:28:43.710 --> 01:28:44.650
What, again?

01:28:45.730 --> 01:28:46.860
[Hayley] Santa Paws!

01:28:47.150 --> 01:28:49.190
[cheering, laughter]

01:28:58.790 --> 01:29:00.330
I’m gonna say it...

01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:02.570
that was one too many deserts.

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:03.580
Oh...

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:04.960
Definitely.

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:07.250
[Diane] <i>Look, Kath,</i>

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:09.800
I don’t really do apologies.

01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:14.300
Oh, sorry. I thought there was
gonna be a ‘but’ after that.

01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:16.810
Give me a second,
I’m building up to it.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.810
But...

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:23.690
If I overstepped the mark,
I really am very sorry.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.900
And I am also sorry 'cause I...

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:29.490
I shouldn’t have snapped
at you like that.

01:29:30.190 --> 01:29:32.280
And if it means anything to you,

01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:34.910
if I had what you have,

01:29:35.200 --> 01:29:36.530
I would be too proud too.

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.160
Thank you, Diane.

01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:43.460
It does.

01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:45.500
And I got you a present.

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.090
- Aah!
- [Geoff] Ooh!

01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:50.630
It’s your book, isn’t it?

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:52.670
- A New York Times Bestseller.
- Yeah.

01:29:53.010 --> 01:29:54.640
[laughs] Thank you.

01:29:55.090 --> 01:29:56.050
A toast.

01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:58.100
To family.

01:29:58.310 --> 01:30:01.250
Present and absent.

01:30:01.450 --> 01:30:02.680
But always with us.

01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:06.770
And... to new friends.

01:30:07.150 --> 01:30:09.270
No matter how hard they are
to understand.

01:30:09.780 --> 01:30:12.030
[laughter]

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:14.850
And... to snow trucks.

01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:17.480
[group] To snow trucks!

01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:19.280
- Yes... [laughs]
- [Geoff] Cheers!

01:30:19.830 --> 01:30:20.700
[Kaye] Cheers.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:23.960
I suppose it's a cheat day
for us, isn't it, darling?

01:30:25.620 --> 01:30:30.550
Next year, I want us to spend
Christmas at home.

01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:33.010
[laughs] No problem, Dad.

01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.800
Macclesfield it is.

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:37.660
No, girl. You misunderstand.

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.890
Home, home.

01:30:40.850 --> 01:30:42.180
[table chatter]

01:30:46.770 --> 01:30:48.900
Son, er,

01:30:49.150 --> 01:30:50.880
maybe now is the time
to give you

01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:53.150
your other Christmas present.

01:30:59.240 --> 01:31:00.080
I, I don’t...

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:03.250
It was the ring I gave
to your mother

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:05.410
all those years ago.

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:10.130
I thought perhaps
that one day...

01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:13.090
you might have some use for it.

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:23.210
Thank you.

01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:24.380
[Geoff] We can put it
in tin foil

01:31:24.570 --> 01:31:26.020
- and put it in the hand luggage.
- [Kath] We're not putting...

01:31:26.230 --> 01:31:27.630
We'll put it in the
hand luggage!

01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:29.350
- You can't leave that...
- Are you joking?

01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:30.780
And, er...

01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:32.820
whoever it is that you choose...

01:31:33.650 --> 01:31:34.610
[laughter]

01:31:34.820 --> 01:31:35.890
Your Lordship.

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.430
Might I borrow him for a second?

01:31:37.630 --> 01:31:39.950
Er, yes, you may.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.870
Come on. Come with me.

01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.750
[giggles] See? I told you
it’d be fine.

01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:51.820
Ah...

01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:53.570
Do you think we’ll ever
have a Christmas

01:31:53.770 --> 01:31:54.910
where it’s just the two of us?

01:31:55.110 --> 01:31:56.220
Ah, what?
