[whispers] ...then enlist
all of us in the cover-up?

10:47.897 --> 10:50.523
Is our family's scorecard
not: murder,

10:50.524 --> 10:52.609
accomplice to murder
and attempted murder?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.319
We pulled up to that place
with, like,

10:54.320 --> 10:57.030
five <i>Datelines'</i> worth
of problems.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.531
Mom,

10:58.532 --> 11:03.036
she's unwell.

11:03.037 --> 11:06.956
And I just feel like, lately,

11:06.957 --> 11:11.044
a little forgiveness has gone
a long way around here.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.380
[sighs]

11:13.381 --> 11:15.632
[Jeff]
Are you kidding me? Shauna.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.343
- No way. No way.
- [Shauna] I know, I know.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.846
- No... way.
- I know, but-but-but...

11:21.847 --> 11:25.183
...but what if she just stays
for one night?

11:25.184 --> 11:28.813
And then, tomorrow, we figure
out what to do with her.

11:32.358 --> 11:35.235
One night. One night.

11:35.236 --> 11:36.611
We cannot leave those two alone.

11:36.612 --> 11:37.904
- No, no, no, no.
- And you can't bail

11:37.905 --> 11:41.199
- on this dinner, okay?
- Fuck.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.451
[sighs]

11:43.452 --> 11:45.412
- Jeff.
- Huh?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.747
This meeting,
is it one of those things

11:47.748 --> 11:49.582
where people say shit like,

11:49.583 --> 11:52.419
"It's not a hotel room,
it's an experience"?

11:52.420 --> 11:54.630
Shauna, of course it is.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.682
Don't fuck this up.

[laughs]

12:38.841 --> 12:39.758
<i>Morning.</i>

12:39.759 --> 12:42.427
- Morning.
- So, I'm actually

12:42.428 --> 12:45.847
feeling a little bit bad
about last night.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.767
- The sex part?
- No...

12:48.768 --> 12:52.479
- [chuckles]
- But the dine and dash part.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.023
[laughs] You mean
the crime of the century?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.734
And-and I loved it,
but, um, also,

12:57.735 --> 13:00.987
I will probably
swing by there later today

13:00.988 --> 13:03.364
just to settle up
with our server

13:03.365 --> 13:08.077
and, you know, explain to him
how it was all your fault.

13:08.078 --> 13:09.579
Oh, wait-- I'm sorry.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.247
- What? My-my fault?
- [chuckles]

13:11.248 --> 13:14.959
[chuckles] Oh, are you
selling me out, Palmer?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.504
How do I know
you're not wearing a wire?

13:17.505 --> 13:19.255
<i>There's only one way
to find out.</i>

13:19.256 --> 13:21.174
- [exhales sharply]
- [laughs]

13:21.175 --> 13:24.594
- Well, that sounds like a dare.
- Ooh, mm.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.012
- Get over here.
- [chuckles]

13:26.013 --> 13:27.680
- Arms out, little lady.
- Ooh.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.349
Yeah. Got to frisk you.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.017
- Oh.
- [both laugh]

13:31.018 --> 13:32.227
Where is that wire?

13:32.228 --> 13:33.686
- Is it here? Is it here?
- [microphone feedback]

13:33.687 --> 13:36.982
No.
[breathing heavily]

13:39.860 --> 13:41.277
[giggles]

13:41.278 --> 13:42.988
[breathing heavily]

13:44.073 --> 13:47.492
Ow! Oh, fuck, motherfucker!
Oh, God.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.160
- Let me see.
- Oh, shi...

13:49.161 --> 13:51.955
We talked about you leaving
your dishes on the floor.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.790
[Van] Very cool,
thank you for thinking

13:53.791 --> 13:55.083
about that right now.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.001
Okay, on the count of three.
Ready?

13:57.002 --> 13:59.504
One, two.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.506
[groans]

14:01.507 --> 14:03.550
Okay.
[chuckles]

14:03.551 --> 14:05.134
This counts as me
saving your life again.

14:05.135 --> 14:06.261
Ugh.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.846
- [sighs]
- Fuck.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.722
All right, let's wrap that up
and get you to a doctor.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.349
I don't need to see a doctor.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.226
- It doesn't need stitches.
- What are you talking about?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.645
I could see inside your foot.
It can get infected.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.896
It's not gonna get infected.
It's fine.

14:16.897 --> 14:20.526
- Van, in your condition--
- No...

14:21.402 --> 14:22.694
Please do not speak to me
that way.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.113
Yeah, no, I'm so sorry.
I get it.

14:25.114 --> 14:29.702
But... can we not take
any chances?

14:31.036 --> 14:33.038
[phone vibrating]

14:36.750 --> 14:39.085
[sighs]
Fine.

14:39.086 --> 14:43.590
I will take myself
to the fucking doctor.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.133
Tell you what, mm...

14:45.134 --> 14:49.345
You go to the doctor, and I'll
deal with the restaurant.

14:49.346 --> 14:50.973
[Walter clears throat]

14:52.099 --> 14:54.475
No. Go away.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.060
No, ma'am,
I'm not gonna do that,

14:56.061 --> 14:58.062
and your circadian rhythm will
ultimately thank me.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.064
Up, up.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.191
Now, what you're
looking at here is

15:02.192 --> 15:05.612
the Tattersall
Oopsie Daisy Tray.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.114
Eggs over oopsie, boopsie bacon,

15:08.115 --> 15:11.951
and this here is the
Lucky Daisy Bottoms-Up Tonic,

15:11.952 --> 15:13.620
which I do recommend
you drink quickly.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.997
It can sometimes
burn going down.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.040
[sniffs]

15:17.041 --> 15:19.292
Ugh.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.086
No, thank you.

15:21.962 --> 15:25.758
Some light calisthenics, then?
Flush out those toxins.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.719
I thought
you might want to get up,

15:29.720 --> 15:31.137
and then I thought you
might want to, you know,

15:31.138 --> 15:33.765
have a chat
about what happened last night.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.475
Which is of course, no biggie,

15:35.476 --> 15:40.605
except that it did seem to me
like what is sometimes called

15:40.606 --> 15:41.981
a "cry for help."

15:41.982 --> 15:45.276
And if it was that,
consider it answered.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.279
[phone ringing]

15:50.199 --> 15:51.991
[gasps]

15:51.992 --> 15:53.619
Hi, Shauna.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.621
No. No, I-- No, I don't.

15:56.622 --> 15:57.997
6 p.m.?
[clears throat]

15:57.998 --> 16:00.875
Okay. [chuckles]
That sounds amazing.

16:00.876 --> 16:03.921
I can't wait.
All right, see you tonight.

16:07.758 --> 16:10.302
[sighs]
What?

16:11.178 --> 16:14.347
- That was Shauna?
- You know it was.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.808
Finally returning your call
from last night?

16:16.809 --> 16:19.018
Well, we didn't really
talk about that.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.311
Exactly.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.313
So not even acknowledging
your call from last night.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.023
[groans]
What is this?

16:24.024 --> 16:25.858
The Socratic method?
Just...

16:25.859 --> 16:28.277
[sighs]
make your point.

16:28.278 --> 16:31.072
These "friends" of yours,

16:31.073 --> 16:33.116
I-I can't help but observe
that they only come around

16:33.117 --> 16:34.534
when they need
something from you.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.535
- [groans]
- And are conspicuously

16:35.536 --> 16:37.370
absent when you need them.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.455
Times like last night.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.665
Or, if you think about it,

16:40.666 --> 16:42.208
any night
over the last six weeks.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.043
It's Wednesday.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.504
On Wednesdays, you and I
clean Caligula's cage.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.299
[sighs]
Walter.

16:50.300 --> 16:54.512
Sometimes I forget that you
can't possibly understand

16:54.513 --> 16:59.434
relationships forged
in life-and-death experiences.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.394
See, us survivors,

17:01.395 --> 17:04.063
we're not sitting around
keeping some petty log

17:04.064 --> 17:07.066
of who needed what, when.
[sighs]

17:07.067 --> 17:10.570
Our bond just runs
deeper than that.

17:10.571 --> 17:14.240
And while I appreciate
that you're worried about me,

17:14.241 --> 17:17.910
and your commitment
to cage maintenance,

17:17.911 --> 17:21.080
I am overdue for some
one-on-one time

17:21.081 --> 17:24.793
with one of the incredible women
that I owe my life to.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.838
So, uh, do you mind?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.923
- I'm gonna... I'm gonna dressed.
- Right.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.222
We know that Mari
skipped dinner,

17:38.223 --> 17:40.308
and there's a ton of berries
up that way,

17:40.309 --> 17:42.769
so I say we head south.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.438
[chuckles]
Great idea. Decisive.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.565
You know, if there's anything
that you want to talk about,

17:47.566 --> 17:48.775
I'm a really great listener.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.276
And this is kind
of like a road trip,

17:50.277 --> 17:52.612
so we can share stories,
discuss the issues of the day...

17:52.613 --> 17:53.946
Yeah. You know,
a lot of the time

17:53.947 --> 17:55.448
when Travis and I went out
hunting,

17:55.449 --> 17:56.991
we wouldn't really say anything.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.619
We would kind of quietly just...

17:59.620 --> 18:01.120
[sighs]

18:01.121 --> 18:03.581
Too many people have
disappeared without a trace--

Crystal, Coach Scott.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.045
Fuck Coach Scott.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.840
Do you think that he's dead?

18:13.509 --> 18:15.051
Do you...

18:15.052 --> 18:19.431
definitely think
that he burned the cabin down?

18:21.225 --> 18:24.018
Coach Scott always
believed in you.

18:24.019 --> 18:26.771
I feel like he'd be really proud
of everything that you've built.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.023
Coach Scott didn't know shit
about me.

18:29.024 --> 18:31.235
We basically never spoke.

How am I supposed to climb out?

19:03.350 --> 19:06.060
I'll starve.
Something will eat me.

19:06.061 --> 19:08.605
That-that thing
that was screaming.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.901
I never believed
you burned down the cabin.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.115
What are you talking about?

19:19.116 --> 19:22.535
- The cabin burned down?
- Seriously?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.537
It burned for, like, weeks.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.416
You're saying
you didn't even smell it?

19:29.960 --> 19:31.919
Honestly, I've been staying
as far away from all of you

19:31.920 --> 19:33.338
as humanly possible.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.844
Stay here.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.013
Stay quiet.

But...

19:50.355 --> 19:51.564
Hi.

19:51.565 --> 19:53.858
Uh...

19:53.859 --> 19:56.152
- Mom?
- Oh. [chuckles softly]

19:56.153 --> 19:58.614
It's okay. She invited me.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.908
- [Jeff quietly] Oh, she's here.

it was a dressy thing.

Uh, you know, about,
about my-my drinking?

20:36.860 --> 20:39.654
Do you have a drinking problem?

20:39.655 --> 20:43.366
I don't know. Do I?

20:43.367 --> 20:47.078
Uh, Misty. Lottie's here
'cause she's staying with us.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.413
- [Shauna] Temporarily.
- [Lottie] Yes.

20:49.414 --> 20:54.378
This family was kind enough
to offer me a port in a storm.

20:57.047 --> 21:00.007
Okay. Um...
[clicks tongue]

21:00.008 --> 21:02.343
Then wha-what am I doing here?

21:02.344 --> 21:06.931
Jeff, um, has an important
work dinner tonight--

21:06.932 --> 21:09.809
Lottie, has anyone shown you
where the linens are?

21:09.810 --> 21:11.477
We have a terrific selection.
Come on.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.981
I'll show you. One of the perks
of being in the biz.

21:14.982 --> 21:16.899
- [Lottie] Please.
- She loves linens.

21:16.900 --> 21:20.653
Wait, wait.
So, am I here to babysit?

21:20.654 --> 21:22.738
No. No, no, no, no.
Of course not.

21:22.739 --> 21:26.993
Um... Oh, fuck, yes.
Sort of.

21:26.994 --> 21:31.080
I'm sorry. I-I called you
because I trust you, okay?

21:31.081 --> 21:33.874
Lottie just showed up here.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.710
I cannot leave her alone
with Callie.

21:35.711 --> 21:38.462
Callie's already suspended,
and the last thing I need is

21:38.463 --> 21:41.799

21:44.344 --> 21:46.846
Well, Callie has
some schoolwork to do,

21:46.847 --> 21:49.849
so I guess just
keep Lottie busy.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.435
Keep them from talking
to each other.

21:52.436 --> 21:54.312
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
We're gonna be late.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.399
Okay. [sighs]
Um, thank you, Misty.

21:58.400 --> 22:02.069
You're a lifesaver.
I owe you. [chuckles]

22:02.070 --> 22:04.740
- Okay, here, here, here.
- Oh, thanks.

22:13.415 --> 22:16.877
Right. Okay,
I'll, uh, put this away.

22:18.879 --> 22:19.962
that it's any less
heartbreaking?

22:19.963 --> 22:22.214
Of course not, but...

Coach Scott and I ended things

22:25.010 --> 22:27.136

did help you

22:27.137 --> 22:29.013
with your own breakup
with Travis,

22:29.014 --> 22:30.348

22:30.349 --> 22:32.392
that I could be
a guiding light for you.

22:33.143 --> 22:37.396
Wait. Yeah. You know,
you really were.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.648
Really?

22:39.649 --> 22:40.900
Are you making fun of me?

22:40.901 --> 22:42.276
No, uh, for real.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.862
Um, uh, let's-let's go
this way instead.

22:44.863 --> 22:45.946

22:52.579 --> 22:54.038
Is something wrong?

22:54.039 --> 22:56.791
No, I... I-I just don't think

22:56.792 --> 22:58.084
that Mari could have
set that up.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.418
Um, must be one of ours.

to go south,

23:06.635 --> 23:09.387
Well, there's berries
