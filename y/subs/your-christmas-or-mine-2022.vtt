-I'm...
-[boy] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:14.771 --> 14:16.022
Mum! Mum!

14:16.940 --> 14:18.400
Mum, don't listen to him!

14:18.483 --> 14:21.361
Gilet gave us that tenner.
We didn't mug him, honest.

14:21.486 --> 14:22.904
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Who is Gilet?

14:22.988 --> 14:24.573
He is. He's our mate.

14:24.656 --> 14:27.325
-What?
-Hello, Gilet.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.661
Is that French?

14:30.078 --> 14:32.706
Well, I suppose the word
'gilet' is, but I'm...

14:32.789 --> 14:34.874
Are you not a little bit too old
to be hanging out with my boys?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.293
I'm nine and three quarters!

14:36.376 --> 14:37.877
-He's a pervert.
-I just...

14:37.961 --> 14:39.296
-He's not!
-...bumped into them in an
alleyway.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.548
-And you gave them a tenner?
-He's a drug dealer!

14:41.631 --> 14:42.924
No, he's our mate.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.801
-Stop saying that.
-[Geoff] I'm back!

14:44.884 --> 14:47.220
-Right, positions! Positions!
-Where are we going?

14:47.304 --> 14:49.014
What are we doing? What's going
on?

14:49.097 --> 14:50.432
We're surprising Hayley!

14:50.515 --> 14:52.142
Great! Okay.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.602
That's...

14:53.685 --> 14:55.562
You're squeezing me a bit tight.

14:55.645 --> 14:57.188
Careful, that's my...

14:57.272 --> 14:58.523
Surprise!

14:58.607 --> 15:00.817
-Merry Christmas!
-No. No. No, no.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.944
-No.
-Where's Hayley?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.988
-Geoff?
-She didn't show.

15:05.071 --> 15:08.783
It's bloody freezing out there!
I've got nipples like a '99
flake.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.744
There's a heavy snow
on the way, Geoff.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.579
-I forgot my coat, didn't I?
-Well, did you call her?

15:12.662 --> 15:15.498
-No, my phone's in my coat.
-What are you doing back here
then?

15:15.582 --> 15:17.292
Getting my bloody coat,
aren't I?

15:17.375 --> 15:18.501
[Granddad] Heading up from
the South.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.046
-You must be shattered. Get
that bag off.
-It's fine.

15:21.129 --> 15:24.049
-Have you been flogging turkeys?
-No. But if I was...

15:24.132 --> 15:27.677
I would just have made
a hundred quid! Hey! Whoa-ho!

15:28.011 --> 15:29.888
-Get some music on.
-You had one job.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.641
What are you on about? I've had
loads of jobs, all pigging day.

15:32.724 --> 15:35.143
-I was delivering turkeys till
five!
-Unbelievable!

15:35.226 --> 15:37.437
Right, boys, upstairs,
go get yourselves cleaned up.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.982
Remember, snitches get stitches.

15:41.066 --> 15:42.901
And tell-tales get...

15:42.984 --> 15:44.319
e-mails!

15:44.402 --> 15:48.031
How many times do
we lose this bloody remote?

15:51.576 --> 15:53.620
-Hi.
-Who the bloody hell are you?

15:53.703 --> 15:56.706
He's either a drug dealer or a
pervert.

15:56.790 --> 15:57.999
I'm not.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.167
Or both.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.128
This is Gilet, Geoff.
He's friends with the boys.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.380
Again, I'm not.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.883
Them kids! How many times
have I got to tell you two, eh?

16:07.050 --> 16:08.885
Hang around with lads
your own age!

16:08.968 --> 16:11.638
-[boy]
I'm nine and three quarters!
-Exactly!

16:11.721 --> 16:14.474
Right. No offence, Gilet,
but come on.

16:14.557 --> 16:17.394
He can stay for a quick
Christmas drink, surely?

16:17.477 --> 16:20.146
-It's fine.
-What other jobs you have to
do, Geoff?

16:20.230 --> 16:22.524
-Don't worry Granddad. I got
the stuffing.
-Come and have a seat with me.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.694
It's gone to voicemail.
It never goes to voicemail.
Love...

16:25.777 --> 16:28.905
Cup of tea, Gilet? Oh, God!

16:28.988 --> 16:30.448
That sounds exotic.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.993
I've come across plenty of
Lees and Darrens in my time.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.787
You can say that again!

16:35.870 --> 16:38.206
But I can't say
I've ever met another 'Gilet'.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.542
It's a body warmer, Kaye.
TK Maxx is full of 'em.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.168
-You should go and look for her.
-I'll be back in a minute.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.671
Look, Kath, let's give it
half an hour, right?

16:44.754 --> 16:46.798
We'll have a cuppa. If we've
not heard from her by then...

16:46.881 --> 16:49.676
Okay, we'll give it exactly
half an hour and then you'll go
and look for her.

16:49.759 --> 16:51.094
What, no cuppa?

16:52.554 --> 16:53.805
No cuppa.

16:54.389 --> 16:55.390
Kath...

16:55.473 --> 16:57.809
[Kath] Honestly, one of these
days
I'm gonna give you a simple task

16:57.892 --> 16:59.102
and you're gonna get it right!

16:59.185 --> 17:00.854
Come on, it's Christmas Eve Eve.

17:03.148 --> 17:04.148
I'm James.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.294
Hello! You must be Peanut.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.005
Ohh! Okay, alright.
Chill, chill, Peanut.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.300
Peanut!

17:30.383 --> 17:32.844
-[clicking tongue]
-Like I said, very casual.

17:32.927 --> 17:33.928
Thank you, Iris.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.224
You may leave.

17:40.602 --> 17:42.353
Will you please put that down?

17:42.437 --> 17:43.688
Sorry, it's just...

17:43.772 --> 17:45.940
That's Tony Blair, right?
And isn't that...

17:46.024 --> 17:48.276
The first thing to establish
when you are in my house:

17:48.359 --> 17:50.403
that you respect my privacy.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.905
Oh, right.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.407
-Sorry.
-And the second

17:54.491 --> 17:56.284
is the importance of
punctuality.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.954
Erm, look, I don't want
to get off on the back foot.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.039
I'm Hayley.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.334
Taylor.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.919
Humphrey Hughes.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.171
And you get off on the wrong
foot,
not the back foot.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.548
Yeah, course, but...

18:10.632 --> 18:12.550
right now I feel like
I'm doing a bit of both.

18:12.634 --> 18:14.636
Yes, well, take a seat.

18:15.470 --> 18:18.264
It has been something
of an inauspicious start.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.350
We had been told good things.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.976
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.979
-Dependable, experienced, cheap.
-What?

18:25.063 --> 18:27.524
And your background checks were
clear.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.150
Back... background checks?

18:29.234 --> 18:31.236
Standard procedure.
You should have been informed.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.656
Look, I don't know what James
has told you about me, but...

18:34.739 --> 18:36.199
-James?
-Yes.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.618
James. Your son?

18:39.452 --> 18:43.873
-Tony Blair's ball boy.
-My son's name is Hubert James
Hughes,

18:43.957 --> 18:46.000
and he is currently away
training.

18:46.084 --> 18:49.212
And I am a little confused
as to how you know him.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.172
Sorry, did you just say
his name's 'Hubert'?

18:51.256 --> 18:53.633
How do you know my son?

18:53.716 --> 18:55.718
We're on the same course.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.638
You train with Hubert?

18:59.389 --> 19:01.474
No, I train with James.

19:01.558 --> 19:02.809
Well, where is he?

19:03.393 --> 19:06.020
Well, I don't know. I was gonna
ask you the same thing.
Is he not here...

19:06.104 --> 19:08.982
Excuse me, sir. This is Doris.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.693
I'm here about the cleaning job.

19:13.111 --> 19:15.572
Bit late, I know, but my... cat
died.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.699
Er...

19:17.782 --> 19:22.620
Iris, I will, er, conduct
the interview in my study.

19:22.704 --> 19:24.455
Very well. Come with me.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.792
[Hayley]
Wow!

19:27.876 --> 19:29.085
You thought I was the cleaner.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.171
Because I had an interview
with a cleaner at 7:00 pm,

19:32.255 --> 19:36.301
and at twenty past seven
you knocked on my door.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.219
Look, I'm going to have to
deal with that.

19:38.303 --> 19:40.138
Won't take long.
She's clearly not right.

19:40.221 --> 19:44.100
You will stay here until I
return.
Understood?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.061
-Yes, sir!
-And don't touch anything.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.813
[Humphrey]
Come on, Peanut!

19:49.814 --> 19:50.815
Come on, boy.

19:50.940 --> 19:53.484
I'm sorry, you don't have a
phone I could borrow?
I left mine on the...

19:53.568 --> 19:54.944
[door closes firmly]

19:57.655 --> 19:59.824
So I know she got on her train.

20:00.992 --> 20:01.993
But did she get off it?

20:02.994 --> 20:05.038
I know I did, 'cause I'm here.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.206
But Hayley's not.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.043
And that begs the question...

20:10.126 --> 20:11.586
where is she?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.089
You say something, young man?

20:18.134 --> 20:19.135
Never mind.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.432
[Geoff] She missed her train,
that's all.

20:24.515 --> 20:25.642
[Kath] Yes and now she's
walking the streets!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.477
[Geoff] Well, she'll be alright.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.480
I thought, you know what,
it's Christmas, screw the brew.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.941
Have I introduced myself
properly?
I'm Kaye.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.693
You can call me Special K!

20:36.527 --> 20:38.196
I'm Ant and Dec's aunty.

20:38.279 --> 20:39.447
Ant and Dec?

20:40.615 --> 20:42.575
Oh, Gilet! You still here?

20:42.659 --> 20:44.077
I offered him a drink.

20:44.160 --> 20:45.161
Kaye, quick word.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.581
What flavour stuffing you get?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.291
Cranberry and chestnut, Grandad.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.085
Now didn't we have a box of
choccies knocking about?

20:52.168 --> 20:54.295
Er, what are you doing, love?

20:54.379 --> 20:56.047
I think he likes me.

20:56.130 --> 20:59.634
Look, we don't know him,
and he is very young.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.594
A minute ago, he was too old.

21:01.678 --> 21:03.304
For Ant and Dec.

21:03.388 --> 21:05.431
[laughs]
Oh, Kath!

21:05.515 --> 21:07.308
I'm a cougar these days.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.977
It's very on trend.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.189
Come on, sis,
it's just a bit of Christmas
fun!

21:13.272 --> 21:16.359
[Geoff] Could have sworn we had
some Maltesers on the go!

21:16.442 --> 21:19.570
Ohh. I wonder how they got
there, eh?

21:19.654 --> 21:22.323
Kath was just saying,
you can always stop for your
tea.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.033
Really?

21:24.117 --> 21:26.285
Oh, God! Completely forgot.
Go and check the lasagne.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.162
-No, it's fine.
-That's me.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.334
I should probably take this.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.378
Do you have somewhere...
private?

21:35.461 --> 21:37.296
Like a study or...

21:38.172 --> 21:39.549
Kitchen's through there.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.511
Okay, yeah. Thank you.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.560
-[chuckling]
-[whispering] Study?

21:50.643 --> 21:51.978
[clears throat]

21:52.770 --> 21:55.398
-Dad, listen...
-[Hayley] Hello, 'Hubert'.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.775
-Hayley?
-[whispering] Surprise!

21:57.859 --> 21:59.360
Where the hell are you?

21:59.444 --> 22:00.903
What are you doing in my house?

22:00.987 --> 22:02.739
I got on your train.
I don't know what I was
thinking.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.200
Well, I do know what I was
thinking. I was thinking it
would be epic romantic.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.161
But then you weren't here,
and it was actually
horrifically awkward.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.663
And now I'm stuck here,
I've lost my phone,

22:10.747 --> 22:13.374
and outside it's starting
to look like the North Pole.

22:13.458 --> 22:15.501
Have you said anything about me?

22:15.585 --> 22:18.921
No! And your house! You said you
lived in a cottage, not a
bloody castle!

22:19.005 --> 22:22.800
Okay, yes, well, I-I may have
done some downplaying.

22:22.884 --> 22:25.511
James, there's a picture
of your dad with Prince Charles.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.015
Yeah, okay, erm...

22:29.098 --> 22:30.558
Okay, here we go.

22:31.267 --> 22:36.773
My dad's official title is
Lord Humphrey Manningham-Hughes.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.858
-Lord?
-Well, he's an Earl.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.110
The Earl of Gloucester, to be
precise.

22:41.903 --> 22:43.362
Are you joking?

22:43.446 --> 22:45.281
I know, I should have told you,
I know.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.868
But, look, I need you
to not say anything...

22:48.951 --> 22:50.828
James, are you a frickin' Royal?

22:50.912 --> 22:52.246
No! No!

22:52.330 --> 22:53.790
Well, technically, yes.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.627
But I'm like... I'm like, 300th
in line to the throne or
something, okay?

22:57.710 --> 23:00.630
Like, put it this way, a lot of
people
would have to croak

23:00.713 --> 23:03.174
-for my character to turn up in
The Crown.
-I can't cope with this.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.594
But, Hayley, this is important:
my dad, he doesn't know about...

23:06.677 --> 23:08.554
-[smoke alarm beeping]
-I don't believe it!

23:08.721 --> 23:10.139
Oh gosh, oh gosh!

23:10.223 --> 23:11.849
How do you turn your oven off?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.935
My oven? Wait, what? What?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.729
I told you to check the lasagne!

23:16.813 --> 23:19.065
-Alright, don't panic!
-What is going on?

23:19.148 --> 23:20.900
-It's...
-Is the house on fire?

23:20.983 --> 23:23.152
-No, no, no!
-What are you doing, James?

23:23.236 --> 23:25.488
Is this some sort of a joke?
James...

23:25.571 --> 23:28.324
what the hell
are you doing in my house?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.701
What you said: Epic. Romantic.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.537
James, I need you to listen to
me.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.914
They do not know about you yet.
Have you said anything?

23:34.997 --> 23:38.584
No. I mean, I haven't really
been
able to get a word in edgeways.

23:38.668 --> 23:40.711
James, I need you to do me
the world's biggest favour

23:40.795 --> 23:42.547
and not say anything.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.591
Okay.
I mean, may I ask why?

23:45.675 --> 23:48.511
I'll explain when I see you,
and I promise we will laugh
about it afterwards.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.389
What am I supposed to say?

23:51.472 --> 23:53.516
Just say I'll be home tomorrow
or something.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.393
We're drama students.
Improvise.

23:55.476 --> 23:58.229
You know how bad I am at impro!

23:58.312 --> 24:01.232
Whenever I get stuck,
I do that weird Scottish accent.

24:01.315 --> 24:04.152
Well, now's your time to get
good, fast!
I've got to go.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.112
Hayley, no! Hayley.

24:07.905 --> 24:09.740
[sighs]
Okay.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.993
[huffs]

24:13.703 --> 24:14.787
Impro.
[chuckles]

24:16.205 --> 24:18.833
[noisy commotion]

24:19.834 --> 24:20.835
Excuse me.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.089
[commotion settles]

24:25.173 --> 24:27.800
I have a wee thing to tell ya.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.350
Your Lordship.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.269
Er, that was James.

24:38.352 --> 24:40.521
-Hubert.
-Yeah, Hubert.

24:40.605 --> 24:44.358
Erm, he said that his train's
been delayed, but he will be
back tomorrow.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.110
Right.

24:46.194 --> 24:50.198
And you are here...
for what reason exactly?

24:50.281 --> 24:53.242
Do you know what?
It's actually quite a funny
story...

24:54.952 --> 24:57.121
Er, but probably for another
time.

24:57.205 --> 25:00.833
I'm just on my way up North, and
I thought I'd nip in, say hi to
a mate.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.003
But he's clearly not here,
so I will just be heading off.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.214
-Safe travels.
-Out of the question.

25:07.632 --> 25:10.760
I'm sorry, sir, but it's too
late for her to travel in this
tonight.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.846
Besides the last train
will have left by now.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.225
Hubert's room's made up already.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.227
-She could stay there.
-Er...

25:21.270 --> 25:22.730
Oh... very well.

25:22.813 --> 25:26.859
Erm, Iris will call a cab
for you in the morning. Early.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.444
Thank you, My Lord.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.529
Come on, Peanut!

25:30.738 --> 25:32.615
-Come on!
-Come along.

25:33.366 --> 25:34.992
Getting the tour, am I?

25:39.455 --> 25:41.624
That's Mr Hughes' study.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.585
And through there is the main
hall,

25:44.669 --> 25:46.712
and beyond that
there's the conservatory,

25:46.796 --> 25:49.799
the kitchen,
and the library's upstairs.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.259
Wow!

25:51.342 --> 25:54.679
You're only a billiard room
away from a full Cluedo board.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.889
That's beyond the conservatory
on the right.

25:58.140 --> 26:01.227
I'm gonna get killed with a
lead pipe
in the drawing room, aren't I?

26:01.310 --> 26:04.689
I sincerely hope not. The
drawing room
is strictly out of bounds.

26:06.065 --> 26:08.651
Besides, there is no drawing
room
on a Cluedo board.

26:10.278 --> 26:13.531
Oh, wow!
This one looks just like James.

26:13.614 --> 26:15.533
If he went full hipster.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.410
That's the First Earl of
Gloucester.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.412
Fought alongside King Charles.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.708
This family has a proud
military history.

26:23.791 --> 26:27.878
It's produced field marshals
at Waterloo, generals in the
Boer.

26:28.671 --> 26:31.632
Hubert's great-great-grandfather
was in the Somme.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.176
His great-grandfather
fought with Montgomery.

26:35.177 --> 26:40.683
And of course, Mr Hughes' own
record in Afghanistan and Iraq
speaks for itself.

26:41.767 --> 26:42.768
Wow!

26:43.352 --> 26:46.105
So how does everyone
feel about Hubert?

26:46.188 --> 26:48.024
-Very proud.
-Really?

26:49.191 --> 26:51.110
As I'm sure your parents are of
you.

26:52.153 --> 26:55.072
The officer training course
at Sandhurst is...

26:55.156 --> 26:57.700
Well, it produces
the best soldiers in the world.

26:57.783 --> 26:58.909
Sandhurst?

26:59.994 --> 27:02.163
You did say you were on
the same course, didn't you?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.207
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, we are.
Sorry.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.293
Sorry, it's been a long day.

27:08.210 --> 27:10.129
Let me show you your bedroom.

27:17.303 --> 27:18.763
Here you are.

27:20.765 --> 27:22.850
Supper will be in the main hall
at nine.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.561
And try and wear something
a little more...

27:27.313 --> 27:28.939
Not... not that.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.638
-[Nan] Looks like...
-[Grandad] I love lasagne!

28:00.721 --> 28:02.223
I've got to say,

28:02.306 --> 28:04.850
losing her phone and missing
her train
is such a Hayley thing to do.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.560
Still don't know why
she didn't call me, though.

28:06.644 --> 28:07.728
[Geoff] Here you go!

28:07.812 --> 28:10.481
Geoff,
what have you got those out for?

28:10.564 --> 28:12.566
Gives Gilet a chance
to get to know us quicker.

28:12.650 --> 28:13.818
'James' is fine.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.361
Oh! Who put that there?

28:15.444 --> 28:18.531
-You did.
-We had 'em made for Hayley's
21st.

28:18.614 --> 28:19.865
Who is he again?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.368
Hayley's friend from drama
school, Mum!

28:22.952 --> 28:24.995
His train got cancelled at
Macclesfield,

28:25.079 --> 28:28.165
so H texted him saying
he could crash here for the
night.

28:28.249 --> 28:29.291
-Shagging, are they?
-Whoa!

28:29.959 --> 28:32.420
-Of course not, Mum! Bloody
hell!
-Oh, God, no.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.588
I'm... I'm very much single.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.173
Really?

28:38.884 --> 28:40.094
And gay.

28:40.845 --> 28:42.054
-Really?
-Aye.

28:42.138 --> 28:45.683
I am just a wee bit
into my men, it's true.

28:45.766 --> 28:48.144
Oh, cool! Who would you
rather snog, Ronaldo or Messi?

28:48.227 --> 28:50.271
That's Ronaldo,
any day of the week. Right,
Gilet?

28:50.354 --> 28:52.565
I'm a Lionel Messi man myself.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.817
Such a low centre of gravity.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.319
So, er, Ant and Dec,
are those your real names?

28:57.403 --> 28:58.988
[Geoff]
Oh, God, here we go!

28:59.071 --> 29:01.782
Right, so, Dad is Antony,

29:01.866 --> 29:04.743
and then Geoff's dad was Declan.
Do you know what?

29:04.827 --> 29:07.413
It wasn't until we'd done it
that we even realised.

29:07.496 --> 29:10.499
Not that we're not big fans of
the presenters. Cracking
chemistry.

29:10.583 --> 29:14.378
Do you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna put this here,

29:14.462 --> 29:16.297
so that Hayley...

29:17.298 --> 29:18.966
is here in spirit.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.926
She's in London, Kath.
She's not dead.

29:21.010 --> 29:24.013
She's such a worrier these days.
[soft chuckle]

29:24.096 --> 29:26.557
Can't imagine what you were like
when she got her tattoo.

29:28.934 --> 29:29.977
Tattoo?

29:31.312 --> 29:32.730
I mean...

29:32.813 --> 29:35.149
if... if she got a tattoo,

29:35.232 --> 29:37.234
just to imagine what you'd be
like.

29:40.029 --> 29:41.780
H would tell me if she got
a tattoo, wouldn't she?

29:41.864 --> 29:42.948
Yeah.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.993
Well, I never told anybody
when I got mine.

30:12.603 --> 30:14.396
Do you get to eat in here every
night?

30:15.064 --> 30:17.900
Most evenings
I enjoy supper in my study.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.109
Alone.

30:20.819 --> 30:21.904
Right.

30:29.870 --> 30:31.789
Must be fun being a lord.

30:34.583 --> 30:38.337
I try not to use the title,
where possible.

30:38.420 --> 30:41.549
Really? If it was me,
I'd be using it all the time!

30:41.632 --> 30:43.759
'Her Lordship's coming through!'

30:43.842 --> 30:46.053
Straight to the front
of the queue at H&M.

30:46.136 --> 30:50.015
'Out the way, people,
Her Lordship needs a new boob
tube.'

30:50.099 --> 30:52.017
[chuckles]

31:02.987 --> 31:05.281
So what are your plans for
Christmas?

31:05.906 --> 31:08.826
We tend not to make a fuss
of Christmas in this house.

31:08.909 --> 31:11.662
Oh, but come on,
the fuss is the best bit!

31:11.745 --> 31:15.082
And you could get a massive
Christmas tree in here!

31:15.165 --> 31:17.793
Like, my house is tiny,
but you should see it at
Christmas.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.629
Man alive, like,
we have Advent candles,

31:20.713 --> 31:22.298
Advent calendars,

31:22.381 --> 31:24.216
we even have this,
like, Advent toilet roll

31:24.300 --> 31:26.635
that's got, like, the Christmas
cracker jokes on it.

31:26.719 --> 31:30.306
And my mum!
She has this musical reindeer.

31:30.389 --> 31:32.725
It's like...
♪ Jingle bells! Jingle--♪ Ugh!

31:32.808 --> 31:35.311
It drives everybody nuts.
And-- [scoffs]

31:35.394 --> 31:39.607
Tonight, my nan, she makes
these,
like, Christmas pudding muffins,

31:39.690 --> 31:41.859
and if you find the one
with the coin baked in it,

31:41.942 --> 31:44.695
you don't have to do any chores
for the whole of Crimbo.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.247
I just think every home should
have a Christmas tree, that's
all.

32:00.294 --> 32:03.088
Well, you won't see many
Christmases at home...

32:03.797 --> 32:05.382
once you get your commission.

32:05.466 --> 32:06.508
Sorry?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.386
Once you're an officer.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.097
You won't get home very often.

32:12.473 --> 32:14.183
Well, all depends, sir.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.894
If I get in the LANCS Regiment,
like I hope, then I'll be just
up the road.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.646
The LANCS?

32:19.938 --> 32:23.233
Well, don't they refer
to themselves as the...

32:23.317 --> 32:25.402
Mmm.
The Lions Of England, yeah.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.404
Or the Kingsmen, if you prefer.

32:33.243 --> 32:37.456
As someone who never
really had a choice,

32:37.539 --> 32:42.211
I'm curious, why did you
choose the army as a career?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.672
Mmm. Much like James, actually.

32:44.755 --> 32:46.382
My dad was a massive influence.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.008
He served?

32:48.092 --> 32:49.802
He served a lot, yeah.

32:49.885 --> 32:53.222
Ice... Icy conditions
were his speciality.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.767
But... very secretive. We're not
really allowed to talk about it.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.437
That sounds like the Mountain
Troop.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.942
Yes, that's the one,
but you didn't hear it from me.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.568
Ninety-Nine Regiment.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.738
SAS arctic survival experts.

33:11.365 --> 33:15.577
Yes, I've seen what those boys
can do
in the mountains of Afghanistan.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.873
Your father must be an
impressive
physical specimen.

33:19.957 --> 33:24.420
Oh, yes, sir.
He really keeps himself in
shape.

33:26.714 --> 33:27.715
[laughter]

33:27.798 --> 33:29.466
That hit the spot, eh?

33:29.550 --> 33:31.468
-What was I saying?
-Turkey Trot.

33:31.552 --> 33:34.346
Oh, yeah.
So, it was this half marathon,
right?

33:34.430 --> 33:37.683
And they do it every Saturday
before Crimbo,

33:37.766 --> 33:39.977
and they call it the Turkey
Trot.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.645
Because every finisher gets a
turkey.

33:41.729 --> 33:44.273
-The race starts at 9:00 am,
right?
-Yeah.

33:44.356 --> 33:48.277
He comes home at 2:30,
and he's carrying...

33:48.402 --> 33:50.195
A frozen bloody chicken!

33:51.196 --> 33:54.742
It had taken him that long to
get round,
they'd run out of turkeys!

33:54.825 --> 33:56.577
Chicken for Christmas dinner?

33:56.660 --> 33:58.120
-I'll never live it down!
-That's for you.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.496
-Thank you.
-Right!

33:59.580 --> 34:02.082
-Let's see who's got the golden
ticket.
-Oh, yeah, Gilet.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.210
You find the ten-pence piece,
and you're chore-free, eh?

34:05.294 --> 34:06.920
In my day, it was a sixpence.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.181
-I think it's stuck.
-I think someone's found the
10p.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.976
Man! I hate doing the dishes!

34:21.059 --> 34:23.728
-He doesn't even live here.
Rematch!
-Is he alright?

34:23.812 --> 34:25.981
-He's choking.
-Bloody no! That's real!

34:26.063 --> 34:27.900
You alright, mate?

34:27.983 --> 34:30.319
You know,
a sixpence was much smaller.

34:30.402 --> 34:33.112
-Is he going to die?
-It would've slipped right
through.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.783
-Stay there. Turn round.
-No, boys! No, don't film!

34:35.866 --> 34:37.868
-Put your cameras away.
-Stay with me!

34:37.951 --> 34:40.078
Geoff! What are you doing?

34:40.161 --> 34:41.580
I'm doing the Heimlich
manoeuvre!

34:41.663 --> 34:43.415
And how many first-aid courses
have you done at work?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.042
Out of the way, out of the way,
out of the way. Turn!

34:52.800 --> 34:53.801
[Dec]
Dramatic!

34:53.884 --> 34:56.178
No washing up for me this year.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.679
You alright?

34:57.763 --> 35:00.474
-Are you alright?
-How about that for drama, eh?

36:22.180 --> 36:26.602
For someone who blushes a lot,
your master is a saucy devil.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.896
[Peanut barks, Hayley screams]

36:28.979 --> 36:31.315
Peanut! Bad dog. Peanut!

36:31.398 --> 36:32.566
Peanut!

36:32.649 --> 36:33.942
Peanut, Peanut!

36:34.026 --> 36:36.737
Peanut! You little dog pervert!

36:38.780 --> 36:41.658
Peanut! Peanut!
Give it to me here!

36:41.742 --> 36:43.410
Drop, Peanut!

36:43.493 --> 36:45.621
Give it to me! Give me that!

36:45.704 --> 36:48.457
Please, please, please, just...
Peanut!

36:48.540 --> 36:50.042
What are you doing down here?

36:50.125 --> 36:52.419
-Sorry, your dog has something
of mine.
-Peanut!

36:52.502 --> 36:54.171
-Give!
-I mean...

36:54.254 --> 36:55.881
it's not really mine.

36:55.964 --> 36:59.259
Technically, I suppose, it sort
of
is mine, but only because...

37:01.011 --> 37:02.012
It's mine.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.683
This area of the house
is strictly off limits.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.268
Yeah, sorry. I know.

37:08.352 --> 37:10.687
Iris said,
but I just lost my bearings.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.067
Miss Taylor...

37:15.651 --> 37:18.362
you may heart cuddles,

37:18.445 --> 37:20.072
but what I heart

37:20.155 --> 37:22.407
is people who can do
as they are told!

37:22.491 --> 37:23.867
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

37:23.951 --> 37:27.245
Um, don't worry, I'll be out of
your hair in the morning.

37:27.329 --> 37:28.622
I'm glad to hear it.

37:30.916 --> 37:32.292
Aren't you forgetting something?

37:43.261 --> 37:44.596
[low]
Oh, my God.

37:47.307 --> 37:49.226
Once again, love, we're really
sorry.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.686
Well, it's my own fault.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.187
[Geoff]
It was, yeah.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.690
You should always
check your food for currency.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.109
This is you.

37:58.151 --> 37:59.236
Thanks.

38:02.656 --> 38:06.243
Right, then.
It's jacuzzi o'clock for us.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.245
We've just had one fitted, en
suite.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.081
Kath here's mad for 'em. Hey!

38:11.164 --> 38:13.417
Gilet does not need to know
about that.

38:13.500 --> 38:17.546
Erm, night-night, love, and
Geoff will drop you at the
station first thing.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.257
Well, it's Christmas Eve
tomorrow.
I was hoping for a...

38:22.050 --> 38:23.218
First thing.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.302
Thanks.

38:26.096 --> 38:27.139

38:46.533 --> 38:49.661
Look at you, Hayley Taylor.

38:50.704 --> 38:52.289
Ah, you are...

39:01.715 --> 39:02.883
Magic?

39:05.135 --> 39:08.263
[Geoff] There's my little floozy
in the jacuzzi!

39:08.889 --> 39:11.558
[Kath] Does Mr Whippy want
some sprinkles and sauce?

39:11.641 --> 39:13.060
[James groans,
Geoff and Kath laugh]

39:13.143 --> 39:15.187

walk.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.694
When you get back to Sandhurst,

40:04.778 --> 40:07.114
pass on my regards to Colonel
Dowd.

40:07.197 --> 40:09.157
I trust he's still in charge
of new intake?

40:09.241 --> 40:13.328
Oh, aye. Old Dowder's still
there.
The old ball-breaker.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.080
Except he isn't.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.499
And he never was.

40:18.041 --> 40:21.253
There is, however, a Colonel
Crosby
who informed me that my son

40:21.336 --> 40:24.089
discharged himself after only
three days.

40:24.172 --> 40:26.716
He'd been led to believe
it was with my blessing.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.219
And of course, he'd never heard
of you,

40:29.302 --> 40:31.179
which I can't say is a surprise.

40:31.263 --> 40:33.723
Why? 'Cause people like me
don't get to be army officers?

40:33.807 --> 40:36.101
Precisely. You're asthmatic.

40:37.185 --> 40:39.354
And quite clearly a performer.

40:40.564 --> 40:42.524
Much more suited to the drama
course

40:42.607 --> 40:45.986
at the Guildhall School
of Performing Arts.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.363
Unlike my son.

40:49.239 --> 40:52.450
I see, so you've been running
more background checks?

40:52.534 --> 40:56.580
We've always ensured
that this family has served its
country,

40:56.663 --> 41:01.001
and I have a right to know
if my son has abandoned his
duty.

41:02.002 --> 41:06.173
So, perhaps you'd like to
explain to me
exactly what is going on.

41:09.301 --> 41:13.180
Maybe you should talk to James
about that, not me.

41:13.263 --> 41:15.640
I just wanna go away
and be with my family.

41:15.724 --> 41:16.766
This has been...

41:17.893 --> 41:19.936
really weird!

41:23.023 --> 41:24.774
Merry Christmas.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.621
Ohh.

41:58.058 --> 42:00.393
Kicked you out already, has he?

42:01.186 --> 42:03.104
No surprise there.

42:12.155 --> 42:15.367
[distant horn honks repeatedly]

42:17.077 --> 42:20.247
I've never really been one
for emotional goodbyes, so,
erm...

42:24.876 --> 42:26.628
-Thanks, Geoff.
-Yeah.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.755
Sorry it couldn't have been
a longer stay.

42:30.632 --> 42:32.175
Let's be honest, mate,

42:32.259 --> 42:35.345
if you stuck round any longer
on Christmas Eve, it would've
been weird.

42:35.428 --> 42:37.138
No one really wanted that.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.891
The 8:33 to Hull on platform
three

42:39.975 --> 42:41.851
-has been cancelled.
-Glad I'm not going to Hull.

Aren't we all, lad?

42:44.562 --> 42:47.941
We apologise for the
inconvenience
this may cause you.

-The train to London Euston

42:52.153 --> 42:53.780
has now been cancelled.

We are sorry for the disruption
to your service.

calling at Reading, Swindon...

Oh, you're kidding me!

43:05.875 --> 43:07.669
Your attention, please.

43:07.752 --> 43:10.297
Due to the adverse weather
conditions

are now suspended.

I repeat, please remain calm.

another night at my mother's.

Come on!

43:35.488 --> 43:36.614
Hello?

43:36.698 --> 43:38.908
I've just had the worst night
of my life.

43:38.992 --> 43:41.661
-Where are you?
-I'm at the station.

43:41.745 --> 43:43.913
And I guess my dad knows
about drama school then?

43:43.997 --> 43:47.751
Only after I spent all night
pretending I was G.I. bloody
Jane.

43:47.834 --> 43:51.087
-I tried to tell you.
-Yeah. When exactly?

43:51.171 --> 43:54.883
I mean, you've had
two months and you actually
haven't told me anything.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.552
I'll be honest, right now,
I feel like I don't even know
you.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.430
-Okay, hang on.
-I can't hang on!

44:00.513 --> 44:02.182
I'm on a real-life payphone.

44:02.265 --> 44:05.685
I had to ask the weird old
station master
to show me how it worked.

44:06.770 --> 44:07.854
Look, I really wanted to tell
you,

44:07.937 --> 44:10.231
but I didn't know
how you were gonna react,

44:10.315 --> 44:13.109
-and then it just felt like...
-I thought we could trust each
other.

44:14.069 --> 44:17.822
Well, yeah, you certainly
trusted me
to lie to your parents about us.

44:17.906 --> 44:20.075
Do not try and deflect this on
to me.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.410
Come on, there's loads of things
you haven't told me too.

44:22.494 --> 44:23.870
Like what?

44:23.953 --> 44:25.497
Like, you're a magician!

44:25.580 --> 44:27.415
You are an Earl.

44:27.499 --> 44:30.502
You went to Eton.
You are going to inherit an
estate!

44:30.585 --> 44:33.338
If you can't be honest with me,
at least be honest with
yourself.

44:33.421 --> 44:34.547
You hunt!

44:35.507 --> 44:37.008
What did you just call me?

44:38.843 --> 44:39.928
Hello?

44:42.639 --> 44:44.057
Hop in, Gilet!

45:02.951 --> 45:04.911
Any chance of a coffee?

45:05.870 --> 45:07.747
I think we can do better than
that.

45:09.833 --> 45:11.918
There you are. That should warm
you up.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.044
Thanks.

45:14.170 --> 45:16.131
I always have a glass of sherry
with my nan

45:16.214 --> 45:18.466
on Christmas Eve
when we have a pamper.

45:19.342 --> 45:21.136
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

45:21.219 --> 45:22.971
Let's call it breakfast.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.264
[Hayley chuckles]

45:27.183 --> 45:29.310
Thanks for letting me back in.

45:29.394 --> 45:31.980
I didn't really know where else
to go.

45:32.063 --> 45:34.649
I'm so glad it was you
that answered the door.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.110
Oh... well, yes.

45:37.193 --> 45:39.988
I'd apologise for
his behaviour if I could,

45:40.071 --> 45:43.950
but, unfortunately,
that's not in my job
description.

45:45.493 --> 45:48.997
It appears that over the
last few years he's forgotten
how to treat our guests.

45:50.331 --> 45:53.376
Still, not to worry. Today's one
of the few days he goes out.

45:54.461 --> 45:56.588
And he won't be back till much
later,

45:56.671 --> 46:00.341
so, perhaps by then your trains
will be up and running again.

46:02.010 --> 46:03.386
Is that James' mum?

46:04.012 --> 46:05.263
Fiona, yes.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.057
She passed away, didn't she?

46:09.017 --> 46:10.435
Four years ago now.

46:11.019 --> 46:13.563
James never really wants
to talk about it.

46:13.646 --> 46:16.524
[sucks teeth]
Like father, like son.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.820
All you need to know is
it wasn't always like this.

46:21.988 --> 46:25.533
No, there was a time when this
house
was full of fun and laughter.

46:26.242 --> 46:29.287
Especially at Christmas.
They used to love Christmas.

46:30.121 --> 46:32.957
Oh, Fiona and Mr Hughes
had great plans.

46:33.041 --> 46:36.419
They were going to host wedding
parties,
even a music festival.

46:36.503 --> 46:37.962
-No way!
-Yeah.

46:38.046 --> 46:40.882
Gloucestonbury. It would
have been quite a weekend.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.800
-[Hayley chuckles softly]
-Oh, anyway.

46:43.676 --> 46:45.470
I better get going.

46:45.553 --> 46:47.597
My list won't 'to do' itself.

46:48.473 --> 46:51.226
So... stay as long as you like.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.936
-Make yourself at home.
-Thanks.

46:53.019 --> 46:54.354
Just don't read my diaries.

46:55.104 --> 46:58.358
And if you do go out,
make sure that dog stays inside.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.235
He's a runner.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.320
I can think of plenty
of other words for him.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.531
Oh, Peanut's alright.

47:05.823 --> 47:10.078
Like a lot of people round here,
his bark is far worse than his
bite.

you're back, Gilet.

They've taken a real shine to
you.

sweeping in from Siberia...

in the ones they threw at me.

-Yeah.

-Yeah.

48:10.513 --> 48:12.140
-Okay.
-You'll survive, lad.

48:12.223 --> 48:13.308
I know.

-Them kids, eh?
-Right, what we gonna do?

48:16.060 --> 48:18.021
Sneak out the back door
and ambush them from the rear?

being stuck in the hell hole.

48:20.356 --> 48:23.234
Oh, the trains'll be up
and running soon enough.

48:23.318 --> 48:24.319
Well...

48:24.402 --> 48:26.112
She wouldn't want us
to cancel our Christmas Eve

48:26.195 --> 48:27.655
just 'cause her train's delayed.

48:27.739 --> 48:30.074
We owe it to her
to crack on with tradition.

48:30.158 --> 48:32.327
-Boys to the pub!
-Girls have a pamper!

48:32.410 --> 48:34.412
Exactly! It's what Hayley
would have wanted.

48:34.495 --> 48:35.997
Right, we're off to The Tuns.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.291
We'll set up the home spa!

48:39.459 --> 48:41.127
Get slicing those cucumbers,
Gladys.

48:41.210 --> 48:43.254
Do it yourself. I'm watching
the news.

48:43.338 --> 48:46.382
It's not going
to be the same without Hayley.
We need it to be the four of us.

48:46.466 --> 48:48.092
Oh, Gilet can take her place!

48:48.176 --> 48:50.470
Why don't you stay with us
and have a pamper with the
girls?

48:50.553 --> 48:52.263
I'm sorry, what's happening now?

48:52.347 --> 48:54.307
Yeah, you could fill us in
on what she's been up to!

48:54.390 --> 48:56.434
No, he's coming to the pub
with me and Granddad!

48:56.517 --> 48:58.061
I do not think that The Tuns

48:58.144 --> 49:00.772

1:02:18.068 --> 1:02:19.528
I've said Coldplay!

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:21.738
'Mamma Mia'.

1:02:23.407 --> 1:02:24.616
Come on, think about it!

1:02:25.200 --> 1:02:26.452
Time!

1:02:26.535 --> 1:02:27.786
-Unbelievable.
-Yes!

1:02:27.870 --> 1:02:30.122
I bloody hate Coldplay.

1:02:31.874 --> 1:02:35.627
And that's another big fat zero
for Puffer Jacket.

1:02:35.711 --> 1:02:37.754
Call me Puffer Jacket one more
time!

1:02:37.838 --> 1:02:40.966
-Ohh!
-Gilet, it's only Christmas
games.

1:02:41.049 --> 1:02:43.886
-This has been going on all
night.
-What are you gonna do about it?

1:02:45.554 --> 1:02:46.805
Puffer Jacket!

1:02:48.098 --> 1:02:50.517
I don't know, Steve.

1:02:52.311 --> 1:02:53.896
Maybe we should take it outside?

1:02:53.979 --> 1:02:55.772
-Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
-Boys, boys!

1:02:55.856 --> 1:02:58.317
Boys, boys!
There's not going to be a fight.

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:00.486
-Batter him, Steve!
-Mum!

1:03:00.569 --> 1:03:03.238
Gilet, that's the cider
talking, right?

1:03:03.322 --> 1:03:06.492
-No offence but Steve here...
-In the army, yes, I gathered.

1:03:07.826 --> 1:03:13.123
Well, I've got level two stage
combat,
so bring it on.

1:03:16.251 --> 1:03:17.711
That's the landline.

1:03:18.462 --> 1:03:20.756
Nobody ever rings the landline.

1:03:24.051 --> 1:03:25.802
-Hello?
-Hey, Mum.

1:03:25.886 --> 1:03:27.387
Oh, it's Hayley!

1:03:28.555 --> 1:03:30.390
Hayley, love, where are you?

1:03:30.474 --> 1:03:33.727
-Don't worry, Mum. I'm on my
way home.
-Oh, thank God for that!

1:03:33.810 --> 1:03:35.270
Are you...

1:03:35.354 --> 1:03:36.855
Are you playing games?

1:03:36.939 --> 1:03:39.942
You know us, love.
Christmas Eve games.

1:03:40.025 --> 1:03:42.528
I'm so sorry I'm not home yet,
Mum.

1:03:42.611 --> 1:03:44.780
-It's not your fault, love.
-No, it is.

1:03:44.863 --> 1:03:46.532
I thought I was...

1:03:47.574 --> 1:03:49.326
I don't know what I thought.

1:03:49.409 --> 1:03:51.370
But believe me, Mum,
there is nowhere else in the
world

1:03:51.453 --> 1:03:53.747
that I would rather be
than at home with you.

1:03:53.830 --> 1:03:55.499
I know, love, I know.

1:03:55.582 --> 1:03:59.294
And there is somebody else here
who can't wait to see you!

1:03:59.378 --> 1:04:01.004
I'll pass you on to him!

1:04:01.630 --> 1:04:02.714
James?

1:04:02.798 --> 1:04:04.591
Guess again!

1:04:04.675 --> 1:04:07.344
Steve?! What the hell
are you doing there?

1:04:07.427 --> 1:04:08.971
I can't wait to see you too,
darling.

1:04:09.054 --> 1:04:11.139
We're through. We're through.
I told you months ago.

1:04:11.223 --> 1:04:13.058
Yeah, well, your family
don't know that, do they?

1:04:13.141 --> 1:04:14.518
How much she's missing you.

1:04:14.601 --> 1:04:16.937
-[all] Aww.
-I was waiting to tell them.

1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:18.188
Anyway, that is none
of your business.

1:04:18.272 --> 1:04:19.231
You're not supposed
to be there at all,

1:04:19.314 --> 1:04:20.649
you massive weirdo!

1:04:20.732 --> 1:04:21.900
Yeah. Yeah.

1:04:21.984 --> 1:04:24.444
Oh, God! Is James still there?

1:04:24.528 --> 1:04:27.030
-Let me talk to her.
-I've met James. Yeah.

1:04:27.114 --> 1:04:28.782
-Lovely fella.
-Let me speak to her.

1:04:28.865 --> 1:04:31.785
Steve, get out of there now,
you freak.
You've got no right!

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:34.371
-This isn't fair. Steve--
-She had to go.

1:04:35.122 --> 1:04:37.207
-I want to talk to her.
-You can't.

1:04:37.291 --> 1:04:39.209
-Yes, I can.
-No, you can't.

1:04:39.293 --> 1:04:40.544
Yes, I can!

1:04:40.627 --> 1:04:42.921
I'm telling you, you can't!

1:04:43.005 --> 1:04:44.631
-Geoff!
-Hey!

1:04:44.715 --> 1:04:47.634
-She's my girlfriend!
-No, she's mine!

1:04:47.718 --> 1:04:50.053
-Not... now!
-Gilet!

1:04:54.850 --> 1:04:56.852
At least, I thought she was
mine.

1:04:58.437 --> 1:05:00.606
-What?
-Why else do you think I'm here?

1:05:00.689 --> 1:05:02.774
I didn't miss my train.

1:05:03.775 --> 1:05:06.528
I came to spend Christmas
with the girl I love.

1:05:06.612 --> 1:05:08.822
-Hang on, you said you were...
-I'm not gay!

1:05:10.741 --> 1:05:12.534
I'm just a really good actor.

1:05:12.618 --> 1:05:14.453
What about Ronaldo?

1:05:14.536 --> 1:05:17.539
Next thing he'll be telling us
he's not called Gilet.

1:05:17.623 --> 1:05:20.792
I'm not called Gilet! My name's
Hubert.

1:05:20.876 --> 1:05:23.295
Then who the bloody hell is
James?

1:05:23.378 --> 1:05:26.089
-Dad!
-I told you they were shagging.

1:05:26.173 --> 1:05:28.216
-Mum!
-No, she would've told me.

1:05:28.300 --> 1:05:30.969
-She tells me everything!
-Or maybe she doesn't.

1:05:31.887 --> 1:05:34.056
Maybe she's not your little
girl anymore.

1:05:35.349 --> 1:05:37.309
And maybe she has got a tattoo.

1:05:39.019 --> 1:05:42.230
Well... if you're so bloody
in love with her,

1:05:42.314 --> 1:05:43.899
why did you leave her in London?

1:05:43.982 --> 1:05:45.651
She's not in London.

1:05:45.734 --> 1:05:48.487
-She's in Kemble at my house.
-What?

1:05:48.570 --> 1:05:50.155
She chose not to come here.

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:53.700
And I thought it was because she
wanted to spend Christmas with
me,

1:05:53.784 --> 1:05:57.245
but seeing as she's marrying
Private Plonker here,

1:05:57.329 --> 1:06:00.248
maybe she just
wanted to get away from you lot
and all this madness.

1:06:03.377 --> 1:06:05.087
I'm actually a Lance Corporal.

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:07.798
I don't care if you're
the Grand Old Duke Of York!

1:06:07.881 --> 1:06:10.884
All I know is I've been made
to do an awful lot of lying,

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:13.720
and I've been lied to an
awful lot and I've had enough,
and I'm going home.

1:06:32.447 --> 1:06:33.532
[outer door closes]

1:06:33.615 --> 1:06:35.575
I'll put the kettle on.

[telephone rings]

1:06:42.541 --> 1:06:43.583
[tearfully]
Steve!

1:06:43.667 --> 1:06:45.502
And you said you
couldn't trust me?

1:06:45.585 --> 1:06:46.461
James, I need you to
listen to me.

1:06:46.545 --> 1:06:48.380
Do you have any idea how
humiliated I feel.

1:06:48.463 --> 1:06:50.590
Are you not even gonna let me
talk?

1:06:50.674 --> 1:06:52.843
Iris was right.
Like father like son, innit?

1:06:52.926 --> 1:06:55.595
You know what, maybe you were
right.
Maybe we don't know each other.

1:06:56.471 --> 1:06:58.974
I'd say we should split up,
but it turns out...

1:06:59.057 --> 1:07:00.142
Hello?

1:07:00.225 --> 1:07:01.435
James!

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:02.769
Hayley?

1:07:05.689 --> 1:07:06.815
Hello?

1:07:09.317 --> 1:07:11.862
Can you hear me? Bloody

1:07:14.406 --> 1:07:16.533

Ho ho ho!

I'm not used to this room

No, no, please, come in.

1:08:39.658 --> 1:08:41.368
She saved them all.

The theatre programmes
from his school plays.

1:08:45.247 --> 1:08:49.876
Yes, I... I remember her
talking about how good he was.

1:08:52.504 --> 1:08:56.591
I didn't make one performance
with Fiona,
and then afterwards...

1:09:00.220 --> 1:09:02.430
I couldn't face it on my own.

1:09:04.390 --> 1:09:07.060
There's so much I haven't been
able to do without her.

1:09:09.312 --> 1:09:12.148
All our plans for the estate,
for the...

1:09:14.901 --> 1:09:16.903
She was irrepressible, Iris.

1:09:16.987 --> 1:09:19.281
So full of life, full of hope.

1:09:25.662 --> 1:09:29.374
Every Christmas Eve,
I go and stand by her grave.

1:09:31.042 --> 1:09:32.794
She isn't there.

1:09:34.587 --> 1:09:36.131
She's in here.

1:09:37.424 --> 1:09:38.841
In this room.

1:09:43.596 --> 1:09:45.599
Forgotten how beautiful it is.

1:09:47.809 --> 1:09:49.060
Well...

1:09:50.020 --> 1:09:55.066
all it needed was for somebody
to come along and let a bit of
light in.

1:09:56.776 --> 1:09:59.362
You know, you and Hubert
are not that different.

1:10:00.822 --> 1:10:03.491
You're both drawn towards
the same sort of person.

1:10:05.368 --> 1:10:08.872
I think the least you can do is
go upstairs and talk to her,
don't you?

1:11:16.439 --> 1:11:17.524
Sorry.

1:11:19.401 --> 1:11:21.403
I was wondering when you'd
notice.

1:11:24.531 --> 1:11:26.324
Well, I should...

1:11:28.576 --> 1:11:30.412
You any good at wrapping?

1:11:35.625 --> 1:11:38.837
I always thought Steve
was a bit of a knob, truth be
told.

1:11:39.504 --> 1:11:43.258
But you put a brave face on
things when your daughter says
she likes someone.

1:11:43.341 --> 1:11:45.677
Find us the end of that,
will you, mate?

1:11:45.760 --> 1:11:47.053
Ta.

1:11:47.137 --> 1:11:49.597
After you left, he burst into
tears.

1:11:49.681 --> 1:11:50.765
[chuckles]

1:11:50.849 --> 1:11:54.060
Said Hayley had split up with
him
just before she went to London,

1:11:54.144 --> 1:11:55.895
but was afraid to tell her mum.

1:11:55.979 --> 1:11:56.980
Unbelievable.

1:11:57.105 --> 1:12:00.025
I've got to admit, I'm relieved.

1:12:00.483 --> 1:12:02.277
Kath was upset, mind.

1:12:02.986 --> 1:12:05.989
Took herself off to bed before
the end
of Muppets Christmas Carol.

1:12:06.698 --> 1:12:08.158
Was she fond of Steve?

1:12:08.241 --> 1:12:11.327
He was stationed away most of
the time, so we never saw that
much of him.

1:12:11.411 --> 1:12:14.998
Can you just stick your finger
there?

1:12:19.210 --> 1:12:22.756
I think it's more the fact that
she couldn't face losing her
little girl.

1:12:24.716 --> 1:12:26.885
If Hayley's with Steve...
[spits]

1:12:26.968 --> 1:12:28.803
then there's a chance
that she might come back here

1:12:28.887 --> 1:12:31.181
and build a life for herself,
you know?

1:12:31.264 --> 1:12:33.767
Not down there
in that hell hole with the
likes of you.

1:12:34.726 --> 1:12:36.644
I guess that's why
she didn't say anything.

1:12:46.071 --> 1:12:47.572
Oh... erm...

1:12:50.617 --> 1:12:52.660
-Give it here, Geoff.
-Yeah, thanks, mate.

1:12:57.040 --> 1:12:58.583
Pigs ear of that.

1:12:59.292 --> 1:13:00.710
[heavy sigh]

1:13:00.794 --> 1:13:02.879
I always used to love doing
the wrapping with my mum.

1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:07.467
When did you lose her?

1:13:07.550 --> 1:13:09.385
It's four years now.

1:13:10.887 --> 1:13:13.848
-Four years to the day.
-Oh, I'm sorry, fella.

1:13:17.268 --> 1:13:19.270
We'd just run out of cranberry
sauce...

1:13:20.438 --> 1:13:24.984
and my mum insisted on doing
a last-minute drive to the
shops.

1:13:26.319 --> 1:13:29.447
She hit some black ice at a
junction,
and that was that.

1:13:35.328 --> 1:13:39.541
I can still see her heading
out the door saying, 'I'll be
right back.'

1:13:41.251 --> 1:13:42.919
And she never was.

1:13:43.002 --> 1:13:44.629
Oh, mate.

1:13:47.090 --> 1:13:49.717
Well, it's been 15 years now
for me with my dad.

1:13:50.677 --> 1:13:52.929
I wish I could say it goes
away, but...

1:13:53.721 --> 1:13:54.931
never really does.

1:13:56.099 --> 1:13:57.725
Especially at Christmas.

1:14:00.311 --> 1:14:04.065
After it happened,
I wanted to stick around, but...

1:14:05.275 --> 1:14:08.153
my dad sent me straight back
to boarding school,

1:14:08.236 --> 1:14:10.238
and the whole house
sort of shut down.

1:14:12.407 --> 1:14:15.451
By the time I left, he...
he wouldn't even look me in the
eye.

1:14:17.453 --> 1:14:19.998
I started to feel like
I'd lost both my parents.

1:14:24.752 --> 1:14:29.591
The truth is, as much as I
wanted
to be here with Hayley...

1:14:31.926 --> 1:14:37.140
an even bigger part of me just
wanted
a proper family Christmas again.

1:14:40.101 --> 1:14:42.312
If only it were that simple, eh?

1:14:43.730 --> 1:14:46.024
I'd be straight round the
Dillons'
up the road.

1:14:46.107 --> 1:14:48.026
They have a 'tur-duck-en'.

1:14:49.068 --> 1:14:53.239
A duck in a turkey in a goose!

1:14:54.908 --> 1:14:56.951
But that's the ball ache, isn't
it, eh?

1:14:57.035 --> 1:14:59.287
You don't get to choose your
family.

1:15:01.164 --> 1:15:03.917
But for my money, those
Christmases

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.544
when there's only a chicken for
dinner...
