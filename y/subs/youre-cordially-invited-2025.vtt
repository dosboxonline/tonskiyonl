18:30.000 --> 18:31.665
- Yes, of course.
- O-Okay.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.290
But Scarlett said she didn't need
to see my credit card

18:33.291 --> 18:34.540
'cause I'm a friend of the family.

18:34.541 --> 18:37.582
And then my daughter's wedding planner,
who is a drunk child,

18:37.583 --> 18:38.874
took over the planning.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.665
Shh. Whose credit card
do you have on file?

18:40.666 --> 18:42.582
- Let me finish explaining.
- Yours.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.665
- So the place is legally...
- Yours.

18:44.666 --> 18:45.749
So, whose credit card's on file?

18:45.750 --> 18:47.207
You know damn well
whose credit card he has on file.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.290
Stop saying "credit card."

18:48.291 --> 18:49.624
Credit card, credit card, credit card.

18:49.625 --> 18:50.957
Let's just all calm down.

18:50.958 --> 18:52.290
- Oh, I'm clam.
- Oh, I'm super calm.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.540
- [scoffs] You don't seem calm.
- I'm dead calm.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.665
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:55.666 --> 18:56.957
But let's get something straight:

18:56.958 --> 18:58.749
My sweet little pumpkin's
gonna have her special day,

18:58.750 --> 18:59.999
and no one's getting in the way of that.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.124
Not you, not some dead lady
who can't keep her shit together.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.749
No one. And come Saturday,

19:04.750 --> 19:07.665
if I look out on that dock
and that bride's not my baby girl,

19:07.666 --> 19:09.915
that bride's going in the fucking lake!

19:09.916 --> 19:11.457
Okay?

19:11.458 --> 19:13.915
Splish-splash, bitch taking a bath.

19:13.916 --> 19:15.332
Okay, you listen to me.

19:15.333 --> 19:18.290
My sister is a literal angel
who walks on this Earth.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.790
- Oh.
- And I'm gonna watch that dock

19:19.791 --> 19:22.999
night and day and make sure
she gets married there.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.707
- And if you try to fuck with me...
- Mm-hmm.

19:24.708 --> 19:27.290
- ...I'm gonna bust your face.
- Mm.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.374
Because I've been doing Pilates
for over 20 years now,

19:29.375 --> 19:32.207
- and my core is a solid-ass rock.
- Oh, really?

19:32.208 --> 19:33.290
Doesn't look like a rock.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.124
Try me. You're gonna break
your fucking hand,

19:35.125 --> 19:37.082
and I'm gonna kick your ass,
and it's gonna be embarrassing.

19:37.083 --> 19:38.707
- [Jim scoffs]
- 'Cause you're big and I'm little.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.832
Okay, you're gonna love it in the lake.

19:39.833 --> 19:42.082
You're gonna become a local legend
like the Loch Ness Monster.

19:42.083 --> 19:45.540
[stomping foot]

19:45.541 --> 19:47.332
[stomps]

19:47.333 --> 19:48.749
[Jim sighs]

19:48.750 --> 19:51.874
When you end up in the lake,
it's gonna wash off your terrible dye job.

19:51.875 --> 19:54.040
[scoffs] I don't dye my hair.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.249
Nice try.

19:55.250 --> 19:56.415
I don't.

19:56.416 --> 19:58.082
I know.

19:58.083 --> 20:01.207
Listen to me. I have legally,
officially booked this place,

20:01.208 --> 20:04.957
so you and your daughter
and all of her friends can go take a walk.

20:04.958 --> 20:06.290
Now, key me.

20:06.291 --> 20:08.332
Welcome to the Palmetto House.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.665
Thank you. You've been a delight.

20:10.666 --> 20:11.957
You said you handled it!

20:11.958 --> 20:13.499
Why didn't you just give them
your credit card?!

20:13.500 --> 20:16.749
Well, you said it was reserved!
I didn't know I had to double-check!

20:16.750 --> 20:18.457
So, you never even called this place?

20:18.458 --> 20:21.457
I have social anxiety,
so I just sent emails.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.707
You get anxiety from dialing a phone?

20:23.708 --> 20:26.165
I can do anything
that doesn't require a phone call!

20:26.166 --> 20:28.790
Where's all the money
we Venmo'd you for this place?

20:28.791 --> 20:31.624
I have it with me on my phone!

20:31.625 --> 20:34.290
I'm sorry! What else do you want?!

20:34.291 --> 20:35.540
I don't know,
aren't you the wedding planner?

20:35.541 --> 20:36.915
[bridesmaids gasping]

20:36.916 --> 20:38.499
- Yeah, and she just apologized.
- [Jim] I'm sorry, I'm just...

20:38.500 --> 20:42.415
That sister of the bride,
she got me... really riled up.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.082
That lady, I mean, she got under my skin.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.624
Don't call her "lady."

20:45.625 --> 20:47.290
Why not? She is a lady.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.332
Yeah, but men only use the term "lady"
when they're mad at a woman.

20:49.333 --> 20:50.499
It's super sexist.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.582
- Mm-hmm.
- You're a sexist.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.832
What? No.

20:52.833 --> 20:54.207
L-Lady's an honorific.

20:54.208 --> 20:56.290
Not when you're like,
"that lady" with a sexist tone.

20:56.291 --> 20:58.457
[Jim] Okay, well, that woman

20:58.458 --> 21:00.415
is a real skanky bitch.

21:00.416 --> 21:01.540
- [exclaiming]
- Oh, my God!

21:01.541 --> 21:03.624
- Oh, yeah!
- Dad, cut it with the "lady" shit!

21:03.625 --> 21:05.665
Okay? Why can't you just drop it?

21:05.666 --> 21:07.165
Sounds like you don't want me around.
Is that right?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.749
- No, not really.
- Guess what, I'm out of here.

21:08.750 --> 21:09.957
- 'Kay, bye.
- See ya, bye.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.541
- See ya, bye!
- Bye!

21:12.833 --> 21:14.749
Can you believe that?

21:14.750 --> 21:16.457
He, like, is totally inappropriate,
and then he just, like,

21:16.458 --> 21:20.124
comes back and he apologizes
and expects me to just, like, dissolve...

21:20.125 --> 21:21.332
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

21:21.333 --> 21:22.957
- I love you so much.
- [crying] I'm sorry.

21:22.958 --> 21:24.290
I love you, too.

21:24.291 --> 21:25.790
It's just that I want your wedding
to be perfect,

21:25.791 --> 21:27.915
- and it's freaking me out.
- I'm freaking out, too,

21:27.916 --> 21:29.874
and you freaking out
doesn't help me not freak out,

21:29.875 --> 21:31.040
and do you get that?

21:31.041 --> 21:33.375
- I hear your truth.
- And I hear your truth.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.874
This has been an emotional roller coaster.

21:37.875 --> 21:40.082
- [♪ Leon Bridges: "Coming Home"]
- <i>♪ Baby, baby, baby...</i>

21:40.083 --> 21:42.165
- I feel terrible.
- Don't feel terrible.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.165
- [Neve] I feel guilty.
- [Margot] Don't feel guilty.

21:44.166 --> 21:46.874
- Are we bad people for kicking them out?
- We are not kicking them out.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.290
- Well, we kind of are.
- They didn't make a proper reservation.

21:49.291 --> 21:51.290
I mean, we are kind of
kicking them out, though.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.790
I have done three separate site visits.

21:52.791 --> 21:54.624
And meanwhile,
their wedding planner hasn't done one.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.249
- She hasn't been here once.
- Okay, that's true.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.207
Listen, you're gonna have
the greatest weekend of your lives.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.665
I want you to focus on that.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.666
I'm gonna get another drink.

22:03.166 --> 22:04.582
Am I a shitty person?

22:04.583 --> 22:06.290
No, you're not a shitty person.

22:06.291 --> 22:07.958
We're just doing a shitty thing.

22:11.416 --> 22:13.874
Oh, no, you can, uh,
just put it on my tab.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.249
You don't have to do that.

22:15.250 --> 22:17.165
Accept it as an apology...

22:17.166 --> 22:19.374
for calling you the Loch Ness Monster.

22:19.375 --> 22:20.999
[sighs] Well, thank you.

22:21.000 --> 22:22.915
And-and you know what?

22:22.916 --> 22:26.874
I want to apologize for suggesting
that you dye your hair.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.291
Because clearly you don't.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.582
So, where are you guys gonna go?

22:33.583 --> 22:37.290
There's a Wet 'N Wild Water Park,
uh, and a...

22:37.291 --> 22:39.915
a Super 8 nearby,
about 200 miles from here,

22:39.916 --> 22:42.124
that'll accommodate most of us.

22:42.125 --> 22:43.874
- Uh-huh.
- So...

22:43.875 --> 22:46.290
We're hoping that will all work out.

22:46.291 --> 22:48.832
- Hmm.
- Uh, I also baked
my daughter's wedding cake.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.332
You baked it?

22:50.333 --> 22:53.082
I don't know how I'm gonna get it
out there, but we'll make do.

22:53.083 --> 22:54.374
That'll be part of the fun,
part of the adventure.

22:54.375 --> 22:56.457
Hmm.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.624
So, why the Palmetto?

22:57.625 --> 22:59.624
My grandmother used to have
a house on the island,

22:59.625 --> 23:02.415
and my sister and I would come
every summer to visit her.

23:02.416 --> 23:04.832
So we have all these great memories here.
How about you?

23:04.833 --> 23:06.207
My wife and I got married here.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.082
Oh. Well, that's...

23:08.083 --> 23:10.165
Which one is she?
I'll make sure and avoid her,

23:10.166 --> 23:12.374
'cause I'm sure she's lovely,
and then I'm gonna feel guilty.

23:12.375 --> 23:14.082
- Oh, sh-she's not here.
- Where is she?

23:14.083 --> 23:15.791
[singsongy] She's dead.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.540
That's a weird way to say that.

23:19.541 --> 23:20.790
She's dead.

23:20.791 --> 23:22.415
[sighs] He married his dead wife here.

23:22.416 --> 23:24.415
[gasps] Oh.

23:24.416 --> 23:27.332
And he's so into his daughter that
he baked her fucking wedding cake.

23:27.333 --> 23:29.207
- No. No, no, no, no, no.
- [Dixon sighs]

23:29.208 --> 23:32.082
I think you're right.
I think we're gonna have to let them stay.

23:32.083 --> 23:33.915
Okay.

23:33.916 --> 23:34.999
[Margot] Excuse me.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.624
Yes?

23:36.625 --> 23:38.665
If you're willing to be reasonable
and accommodating,

23:38.666 --> 23:40.165
we're willing to split the venue.

23:40.166 --> 23:42.624
Oh, my God, that's incredible.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.415
Uh, I'm so sorry.
I don't know if that would be possible.

23:44.416 --> 23:47.082
My inn is not large enough
to accommodate everyone here.

23:47.083 --> 23:49.749
Whatever we say in front of you, Leslie,
will be our legal negotiated agreement.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.290
Negotiation on, Leslie.
You're our legal mediator.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.457
I don't even know what that is.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.374
- Start writing. Yeah.
- Figure it out.

23:55.375 --> 23:57.582
Rehearsal dinner. You take outside,
and we'll take the farmhouse.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.415
- Ceremony? We need the dock.
- Oh, we're gonna need the dock.

23:59.416 --> 24:01.540
Well, okay,
we're willing to split the dock.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.624
It-it's too tiny and narrow.
I don't think we can split it.

24:03.625 --> 24:05.749
- He's correct about that.
- Maybe we could split it by time.

24:05.750 --> 24:08.415
- Yes, we'll take the first half of sunset.
- And we'll take the second half.

24:08.416 --> 24:10.749
Is timing the sunset even a thing?

24:10.750 --> 24:12.707
- I think that's gonna work out.
- Okay, what about the reception?

24:12.708 --> 24:14.165
Flip it. You take the farmhouse.

24:14.166 --> 24:15.790
- And you go outside.
- Yeah, perfect.

24:15.791 --> 24:17.499
Uh, uh, Caldwell reception...

24:17.500 --> 24:19.374
Okay, that's gonna give me time
to get a tent.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.749
Oh, the thing is,
we don't allow tents on the lawn.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.790
- Yeah, she's gonna need a tent.
- I'm gonna need a tent.

24:23.791 --> 24:25.249
Actually, I don't think
that will be possible...

24:25.250 --> 24:26.874
- Just get the woman a fucking tent!
- [Margot] Bend the rules, Leslie.

24:26.875 --> 24:28.124
Guess we're getting a tent.

24:28.125 --> 24:29.582
- This is a fire hazard.
- Do we have a deal?

24:29.583 --> 24:30.749
- I think we do.
- I think we do.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.832
- Great.
- Great.

24:31.833 --> 24:34.415
Jenni, looks like you're getting
married here after all.

24:34.416 --> 24:36.165
- We are?
- [Jim] Yes.

24:36.166 --> 24:38.791
- [Jenni] Oh, my God!
- [bridesmaids screaming happily]

24:40.083 --> 24:41.499
- Jim Caldwell. Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

24:41.500 --> 24:42.915
- I'm Margot.
- Jenni.

24:42.916 --> 24:45.000
[quiet chatter nearby]

24:47.083 --> 24:49.499
[laughter]

24:49.500 --> 24:50.582
Yeah, you loved it.

24:50.583 --> 24:52.082
I loved it.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.166
[chatter continues indistinctly]

24:55.375 --> 24:57.165
Well, how do, Margot?

24:57.166 --> 24:58.249
Mama.

24:58.250 --> 24:59.457
Good night, Grandma.

24:59.458 --> 25:00.707
Good night, Aunt Margot.

25:00.708 --> 25:02.875
Oh, good night, buddy.

25:04.458 --> 25:05.457
[clears throat]

25:05.458 --> 25:06.999
You don't know his name.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.499
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

25:08.500 --> 25:09.749
- Theodore.
- It's Tucker Lee.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.582
Tucker Lee. I knew that.

25:11.583 --> 25:13.499
They're family, Margot.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.290
You know, you don't even put me
in the family Christmas card.

25:15.291 --> 25:17.749
I'm fine with it. It's just,
you're being a little hypocritical.

25:17.750 --> 25:21.665
That's because you don't visit
at Thanksgiving, which is when

25:21.666 --> 25:24.207
- we take the family Christmas photo.
- I can't-- my work.
I actually have a job.

25:24.208 --> 25:27.040
It's fine. Let's not do this
right now, okay?

25:27.041 --> 25:28.665
Let's focus on Neve.

25:28.666 --> 25:31.499
[whispering] What do you think
of this Dixon?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.124
[whispering] Well, I think
he's a great person.

25:33.125 --> 25:36.165
And I think he's gonna be
a wonderful husband and a great father.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.999
When they decide to have kids one day.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.707
Well, I have concerns.

25:40.708 --> 25:44.165
Mom, Nevey is very happy.
That should be all that concerns you.

25:44.166 --> 25:47.499
Well, you only live for yourself--
you know, you're childless--

25:47.500 --> 25:50.832
and I don't think
you understand how important

25:50.833 --> 25:53.749
a partner with a steady paycheck is.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.499
You just crammed so many insults
into so few words.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.957
That was like an insult haiku.

- but the truth is,
if you drill down on it...
- Mm-hmm.

It was not entirely his fault.

and very belligerent.

- Me?
- Yes.
- [laughing] You did deck the bride.

I'm trying to protect you.

for us tonight,

- No, I think that you should go to bed.
- Why?

40:15.500 --> 40:17.540
Because tomorrow is my wedding, and
I really don't want you to be shit-faced.

D-Do you want to talk about it?

40:56.375 --> 40:58.124
I'm so nervous about tomorrow.

40:58.125 --> 41:01.499
Okay, uh... that seems normal.

41:01.500 --> 41:03.915
Everyone just tells us that
we're too young and we should wait,

41:03.916 --> 41:06.207
but my parents didn't wait
and they were happy,

41:06.208 --> 41:08.665
and if they would've waited,
then I wouldn't even be here

41:08.666 --> 41:11.624
because my mom would've gotten sick
and died before they even had me.

41:11.625 --> 41:14.207
What does your dad say?

41:14.208 --> 41:16.082
Oh, I cannot talk to Dad about this.
Are you kidding?

He's so worried about me all the time.

41:17.833 --> 41:19.915
Like, his whole life is me.

41:19.916 --> 41:22.415
Yeah, that's a lot of pressure
to put on you.

41:22.416 --> 41:24.833
That his happiness is riding on yours?

41:25.916 --> 41:27.582
I never thought about it that way.

41:27.583 --> 41:29.624
What do you think I should do?
Just tell me.

41:29.625 --> 41:30.832
I'll do whatever you say.

41:30.833 --> 41:33.040
- Why would you want to know what I think?
- I heard your speech.

41:33.041 --> 41:35.707
You were so honest and badass,

41:35.708 --> 41:37.624
and you've, like,
lived a full life, you know?

41:37.625 --> 41:38.957
Like, maybe I shouldn't get married.

41:38.958 --> 41:41.207
Maybe I should just move to L.A.
and fuck a Red Hot Chili Pepper.

41:41.208 --> 41:43.040
No, no, no. Don't do that. Don't... No.

41:43.041 --> 41:44.332
What's Flea?

41:44.333 --> 41:47.166
You know what? I think that maybe
you're having wedding night jitters.

- Ow.

...that female person-- did to my baby.

42:26.916 --> 42:28.707
She didn't mean to.

42:28.708 --> 42:31.540
You know, she's actually nice, by the way.

42:31.541 --> 42:33.707
Oh, yeah, she was really nice
when she physically assaulted you.

42:33.708 --> 42:34.915
Okay.

42:34.916 --> 42:36.624
[sighs] Okay.

42:36.625 --> 42:38.041
Let's get to work.

42:40.416 --> 42:41.666
I'll go lightly.

42:47.250 --> 42:49.332
Oh, no, I do everything.

42:49.333 --> 42:51.832
- I actually do lots of Marvel stuff.
- Oh.

42:51.833 --> 42:53.999
She can do creature makeup.
She can make you look like an alien.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.665
[Margot gasps]

43:01.666 --> 43:03.249
It looks a little poofy.

43:03.250 --> 43:06.582
It's just, like, popping out a bit.

43:06.583 --> 43:08.415
You know what, sweetie?
Let me help you for a second.

43:08.416 --> 43:10.332
Thank you. We'll be right back.

43:10.333 --> 43:11.957
What are they even talking about?

43:11.958 --> 43:13.540
- [hushed] You're showing.
- What?!

43:13.541 --> 43:14.832
- Yes.
- No.

43:14.833 --> 43:17.165
Oh, my God. Is it really that noticeable?

43:17.166 --> 43:19.166
- Try and suck it in.
- [inhales]

43:20.916 --> 43:23.249
Jane, can we get your help really quick?

43:23.250 --> 43:25.249
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you. We'll be right back.

43:25.250 --> 43:26.999
I don't know how they gonna fix that.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.583
Nobody uses
the proper underpanties anymore.

43:30.625 --> 43:32.999
Um, can we put a peplum on that, or...?

43:33.000 --> 43:34.415

43:44.958 --> 43:47.915
By the way, did y'all talk
to the other bride's father?

43:47.916 --> 43:49.707
Just a lovely man.

43:49.708 --> 43:52.999
Oh, did y'all see that duet
he did with her?

43:53.000 --> 43:55.207

then she's gonna be closer to my family

55:21.833 --> 55:24.082

that now that she's married,

55:38.583 --> 55:40.625
she'll be out of my life
and I'll be all alone.

55:42.875 --> 55:45.124

Well, I mean, maybe, you know,

01:36:52.833 --> 01:36:56.249

and she's having a baby,

01:36:56.250 --> 01:36:58.999

No, that's not it. That's not it at all.

01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:06.874

to see your brother and their kids and...

01:37:06.875 --> 01:37:09.791
And you say you don't miss seeing them,
but maybe you do miss seeing them.

Nah, it's probably
that alligator bite medication.

01:37:14.416 --> 01:37:17.665

are growing up so quickly.
