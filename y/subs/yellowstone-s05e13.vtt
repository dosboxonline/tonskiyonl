01:01:00.586 --> 01:01:03.551
Anything.

01:01:03.655 --> 01:01:07.206
Don't spend a dime of your money
or anything that you've earned

01:01:07.310 --> 01:01:09.240
on this place.

01:01:09.241 --> 01:01:11.000
Not a dime. It...

01:01:11.103 --> 01:01:12.862
You can't save it that way.

01:01:12.965 --> 01:01:15.793
Yeah, I know.

01:01:15.931 --> 01:01:17.275
You either.

01:01:17.379 --> 01:01:19.965
I... I don't have any money.

01:01:20.103 --> 01:01:22.068
Yeah, you... you do.

01:01:22.172 --> 01:01:23.931
Little over 30 million.

01:01:24.862 --> 01:01:27.000
[laughs softly]

01:01:27.103 --> 01:01:30.103
Can I ask you a question?
Business question?

01:01:30.206 --> 01:01:32.206
Sure.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:34.931
Let's take your car. Uh, how
mu... how much is that worth?

01:01:35.034 --> 01:01:38.689
Uh, it's leased, so it's not
worth anything to me.

01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:40.413
But if-if you owned it.

01:01:40.551 --> 01:01:41.931
300,000.

01:01:42.068 --> 01:01:43.793
And if you sold that to me

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:45.827
for one dollar,
would that be illegal?

01:01:45.965 --> 01:01:47.896
It would be stupid,
but it wouldn't be illegal.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.172
Okay, so I buy this car
for one dollar,

01:01:51.275 --> 01:01:53.241
and then I take
this $300,000 car

01:01:53.344 --> 01:01:54.620
- that I bought for one dollar...
- [scoffs]

01:01:54.724 --> 01:01:56.103
...and I register it.

01:01:56.206 --> 01:01:57.931
What do I pay in sales tax?

01:01:58.034 --> 01:01:59.758
Is it based off

01:01:59.896 --> 01:02:03.689
what I paid
or the value of the car?

01:02:03.793 --> 01:02:06.275
- What are you cooking?
- Just answer the question.

01:02:06.379 --> 01:02:09.827
Tax is based on
what you paid for it.

01:02:13.206 --> 01:02:14.965
That's what I thought.

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:26.379
- [truck door closes]
- [engine starts]

01:02:36.551 --> 01:02:39.344
Why didn't I think of that?

01:02:39.448 --> 01:02:41.586
Kayce!

01:02:43.517 --> 01:02:44.551
[panting]

01:02:46.965 --> 01:02:48.206
Who?

01:02:48.344 --> 01:02:50.034
Give me a day,
just to make sure.

01:02:51.379 --> 01:02:54.000
You are smarter than you look,
little brother.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:02:58.586
- That ain't saying much.
- Tate.

01:03:00.655 --> 01:03:01.965
Thank you.

I didn't tell her anything.
She figured it out.

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:16.550
Figured out what?

01:03:16.551 --> 01:03:19.413
The only way to save this place.

01:03:21.827 --> 01:03:24.000
