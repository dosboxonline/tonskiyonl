I'm gonna have to stay
at the lodge for a while.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.108
There's a lot to go through.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.626
You want me to pack you a bag?

30:47.729 --> 30:49.798
Please.

30:53.695 --> 30:55.764
You want me to pack one as well?

31:00.695 --> 31:02.867
Very much.

31:07.143 --> 31:08.488
Let's take a walk, son.

31:30.626 --> 31:32.936
We're just gonna keep walking?

31:33.040 --> 31:34.936
Or are we gonna talk, too?

31:39.246 --> 31:40.589
You know, I never asked you

31:40.590 --> 31:42.833
what you wanted to be
when you grow up.

31:43.764 --> 31:45.143
I didn't because...

31:45.281 --> 31:48.488
hell, I don't even know, myself.

31:48.626 --> 31:51.936
I don't have ambition like Beth.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.038
I don't feel the duty
that drove my father.

31:54.039 --> 31:57.660
I've never had a job
that made me feel whole.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.971
Only your mother does that,
and you.

32:02.074 --> 32:03.384
You do that.

32:06.246 --> 32:08.281
So I'm asking you now.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.315
I guess I never really
thought about it, either.

32:13.419 --> 32:17.246
I mean, I figured
I'd be working the ranch.

32:17.350 --> 32:19.212
I also thought about being
a fly-fishing guide,

32:19.350 --> 32:21.350
but that's not much of a career.

32:21.453 --> 32:23.902
Well, it is
if it's what you love.

32:25.522 --> 32:28.557
I thought we were gonna talk
about Grandpa.

32:30.143 --> 32:33.660
Well, we are.
We're talking about his legacy.

32:33.764 --> 32:35.660
And if that's something
that you feel compelled

32:35.764 --> 32:37.831
to continue, then I'll...

32:37.832 --> 32:40.522
find a way to make sure
that happens.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.660
Is that your job now?

32:46.522 --> 32:49.177
Only if it's your job next.

32:49.281 --> 32:51.867
If that's something
that you want.

32:51.971 --> 32:55.936
I mean, I always wanted
to work the ranch,

32:56.040 --> 32:59.451
but I'm not sure
about running it.

32:59.452 --> 33:01.798
Running it's what
got him killed.

33:05.798 --> 33:07.971
Can we just run this?

33:09.005 --> 33:10.798
Maybe.

33:14.212 --> 33:16.557
Is that all we're gonna say
about Grandpa?

33:21.040 --> 33:23.591
Is there something
you want to say?

33:25.212 --> 33:27.833
I just don't understand why.

33:32.212 --> 33:34.074
There's a lot
you don't know, son,

33:34.177 --> 33:37.660
and there's a lot
that I can't tell you yet.

33:38.902 --> 33:41.384
Just know this:

33:41.488 --> 33:43.315
You can remember
the way he lived,

33:43.419 --> 33:45.555
or you can remember
the way he died.

33:45.556 --> 33:48.005
Your heart can't focus on both.

33:49.453 --> 33:52.003
You're gonna have to choose
to miss him

33:52.004 --> 33:54.764
or to be mad at him.

33:58.315 --> 34:00.798
I'll miss him, then.

34:01.695 --> 34:03.833
Yeah. Me, too, buddy.

34:32.453 --> 34:35.453
Jamie. I was very sorry to hear.

34:35.557 --> 34:37.244
He was a hell of a man.

34:37.245 --> 34:39.108

No, they aren't.

34:58.557 --> 35:00.936

35:01.074 --> 35:03.040
I can cancel your day
if you'd like.

35:03.143 --> 35:06.384
I'd rather hide in my day,

Thank you.

42:56.143 --> 43:00.106
And, while tragic, it...

43:00.107 --> 43:02.488
it does present
new opportunities for us,

43:02.591 --> 43:05.831
depending on how the estate
decides to operate the ranch.

43:05.832 --> 43:08.419
The estate cannot
afford the ranch.

43:08.522 --> 43:10.591
Best thing for the ranch--
if it's put to a use

43:10.695 --> 43:13.246
that benefits the community

43:13.384 --> 43:15.246
and your plans accomplish that.

43:15.384 --> 43:17.212
I'll be seeing
the lieutenant governor

43:17.315 --> 43:18.729
to reinstate the lease,

43:18.833 --> 43:20.831
which Governor Dutton
had no authority to negate,

43:20.832 --> 43:22.419
as your lawsuit states.

43:22.522 --> 43:24.522
Since the lease
predated the ranch

43:24.626 --> 43:27.764
being placed in a land trust,
my office will begin proceedings

43:27.902 --> 43:30.384
to negate
the land trustee restrictions.

43:30.488 --> 43:31.833
Do you have a timeline?

43:32.660 --> 43:34.658
I need to subpoena
John Dutton's will.

43:34.659 --> 43:37.833
I'm certain that it was changed
since I drafted it.

43:37.936 --> 43:40.384
And will the estate contest it?
I'm sure.

43:40.488 --> 43:44.141
How long can they
afford to fight? Not long.

43:44.142 --> 43:47.831
But Beth is resourceful,
if nothing else,

43:47.832 --> 43:50.074
and she will think
of something we haven't

43:50.177 --> 43:52.419
to complicate this
to some degree.

43:52.557 --> 43:56.557
Cautiously, I would say a year
to return to construction.

43:56.660 --> 43:59.419
I don't think they can afford
to fight much longer than that.

44:00.212 --> 44:03.108
And how long
to reinstate the lease?

44:03.936 --> 44:05.315
Well, I can have
the lease reinstated

44:05.453 --> 44:06.453
by the end of the week.

44:06.557 --> 44:08.281
You can continue
the planning phase

44:08.384 --> 44:10.626

44:12.936 --> 44:16.108

44:32.005 --> 44:33.315

44:40.936 --> 44:43.764

44:46.626 --> 44:48.143
I'll catch up.

44:48.281 --> 44:51.315
The attorney general and I have
some specifics to mull over.

44:53.108 --> 44:55.522

45:03.764 --> 45:05.831

45:05.832 --> 45:08.660
If he'd fallen off a building
or drowned in a river,

45:08.764 --> 45:10.488
she'd still think
that you did it.

45:12.143 --> 45:15.177
If he had cancer, she'd find
a way to blame it on you.

45:16.350 --> 45:17.902
No.

45:18.798 --> 45:20.557
You've won, Jamie.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.350
The kingdom is yours.

45:26.246 --> 45:30.384

45:40.177 --> 45:41.729

46:20.557 --> 46:22.350
I don't even know why
I'm crying.

46:26.108 --> 46:27.557
You know that?

46:27.660 --> 46:30.384
Summer, you know who,
uh, John Deere is?

46:31.074 --> 46:33.626
- Tractors.
- Mm-hmm.

46:33.729 --> 46:35.729
A hundred and fifty years ago,
they made wagons,

46:35.867 --> 46:37.557
and they were
smart enough to know

46:37.695 --> 46:39.143
when the engine was invented

46:39.246 --> 46:41.040
that the horse was done
pulling people around.

46:41.143 --> 46:43.143
So were they.

46:43.246 --> 46:45.212
So they started making tractors.

46:46.315 --> 46:47.453
Still do.

46:47.591 --> 46:50.246
They rolled with the changes.

46:51.246 --> 46:54.074
I guess we're just gonna
have to do the same, too.
