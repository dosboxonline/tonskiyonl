WEBVTT

01:53.863 --> 01:55.989
- How fast, Paulo?
- 4'32.

01:56.157 --> 01:59.660
Fucking hell!
A new record the day you quit.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.578
Something to remember me by.

02:01.746 --> 02:04.998
Frame that,
you won't need it again.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.502
A speech, Joe!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.053
Where's DanieI?

02:30.233 --> 02:34.987
You all know DanieI handed in
his resignation last night.

02:35.530 --> 02:38.866
He's giving up 2-wheelers
for 4-wheelers.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.371
He's not like a normaI guy
who starts on all fours

02:44.539 --> 02:47.082
and ends up on his own two feet.

02:47.584 --> 02:50.294
He was the best among us.

02:50.461 --> 02:53.881
And, above all, a perfect colleague!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.049
We'll miss you!

03:12.400 --> 03:14.151
Did you kiss me, Lily?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.944
Or did your lips slip?

03:16.112 --> 03:19.364
I'd just like to know where I stand.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.914
Is that better?

03:32.337 --> 03:35.422
If you slipped again,
you're really clumsy.

03:38.509 --> 03:43.138
To celebrate DanieI's departure,
let's have a parade!

03:44.891 --> 03:48.518
Watch this, Lily,
you won't see it again.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.604
- How many are there?
- A lot.

04:05.912 --> 04:06.745
The greatest...

04:14.837 --> 04:15.837
Move it, man!

04:24.138 --> 04:25.264
Wow!

04:47.787 --> 04:48.620
Bingo!

04:59.507 --> 05:00.966
Having a party?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.468
- Pizza guys?
- Pizza Fuzz.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.763
We're out of boxes
but we'd like to see your licence.

05:07.307 --> 05:11.351
I must have left it inside
but I can get it.

05:11.686 --> 05:12.936
Make it snappy.

05:13.104 --> 05:14.604
Coming right up...

05:14.772 --> 05:16.148
Move it!

05:28.494 --> 05:30.871
They've had 5 minutes...

05:48.681 --> 05:51.058
Watch out for the oiI...

05:51.225 --> 05:52.559
OiI?

05:53.311 --> 05:57.022
Yeah, it's my pad...
but it's a garage too.

05:59.692 --> 06:02.110
It's not much, you know.

06:04.655 --> 06:06.114
It's different...

06:08.368 --> 06:10.243
I've known you two years.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.663
Why didn't you ever bring me here?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.625
I need time to reach a decision.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.835
What made your mind up?

06:21.756 --> 06:22.964
The neckline.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.175
Pretty, isn't it?

06:25.343 --> 06:26.927
It's brand new.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.972
We'll try not to spoiI it.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.226
Could this ruin our friendship?

06:34.394 --> 06:37.187
We've laid the foundations,
now let's build.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.940
- We could wait...
- No way.

06:40.108 --> 06:42.484
You'd think I don't want this.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.778
I don't want to be rude.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.077
- Oh no!
- What?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.704
- Six o'clock.
- So? It's Saturday.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.207
- It's for a job.
- What?

06:57.667 --> 07:00.419
You didn't find a new job overnight!

07:00.586 --> 07:03.130
No, it's about my next job.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.882
I've waited months for this.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.428
I thought you'd waited months
for me...

07:09.804 --> 07:11.763
Make that months, plus one hour.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.433
An hour at the most.

07:26.696 --> 07:29.281
Hey, greenhorn,
you need a ticket.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.253
Remember the photos next time.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.629
77!

07:44.797 --> 07:48.133
247... I'm in for a long wait.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.850
- Been in the trade long?
- 25 years yesterday.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.021
I just retired.
This is the first time

08:01.189 --> 08:03.648
in 25 years
that I can read the paper.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.359
Oh, right...

08:15.620 --> 08:17.496
Wakey-wakey, 247!

08:19.373 --> 08:20.415
Here I am!

08:20.583 --> 08:23.168
Your ticket, two photos.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.087
Sign here... and here.

08:27.548 --> 08:31.551
Driver's professionaI card,
transport certificate,

08:32.470 --> 08:36.264
meter acquisition papers,
log-book,

08:36.807 --> 08:39.351
plate and the roof unit.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.649
That's it?

08:49.570 --> 08:52.030
- After 6 years?
- Want a marching band?

08:52.823 --> 08:55.242
No, but a smile would help.

08:59.038 --> 09:00.121
248!

09:06.837 --> 09:09.422
Midday.
I've gone for croissants

09:09.590 --> 09:12.467
and married the baker in despair.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.719
Good-bye. See you later.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.029
Congratulations, Mr DanieI!

09:33.364 --> 09:34.406
It's nothing...

09:34.574 --> 09:36.408
No, really...

10:21.662 --> 10:23.121
A tourist now?

10:23.914 --> 10:26.207
Your send-off was a blast!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.793
Ace.
Something's worrying me...

10:28.961 --> 10:29.586
What's up?

10:30.338 --> 10:32.714
That thing sounds weird.
Does it work?

10:32.882 --> 10:35.050
It's tanked up with vitrioI!

10:35.217 --> 10:38.261
I just pissed off
two cops downtown.

10:38.429 --> 10:39.804
Left them standing!

10:40.097 --> 10:43.433
Listen to this.
two motorcycle cops on the boulevard.

10:43.809 --> 10:48.647
Before they could get into first,
I'd hit the beach!

10:48.814 --> 10:50.607
They were green!

10:50.775 --> 10:52.984
They'll need a week to get over it.

10:53.152 --> 10:56.363
I went racing through the tunneI,
burning rubber.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.199
I heard one call for his mom!

10:59.367 --> 11:01.534
They won't forget old Paulo.

11:03.204 --> 11:05.705
You're right, Paulo.
They haven't.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.629
Hey, girls!
Still got your moustaches?

11:26.060 --> 11:29.521
How about the beach, girls?
Free ride today.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.690
My treat, let's go...

11:33.067 --> 11:36.861
Are you a "taxi" taxi
or a nice taxi?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.614
This driver's the friendly type

11:39.824 --> 11:41.449
who opens doors,

11:41.826 --> 11:45.120
drives steadily,
speaks when he's spoken to

11:45.287 --> 11:47.497
and helps if you ask nicely.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.457
Perfect!

11:57.258 --> 11:58.883
Where to then?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.385
See that house?

12:00.553 --> 12:03.096
The pink one?
With the carriage entrance?

12:04.140 --> 12:06.307
- Yeah, I see it...
- The pink one...

12:06.475 --> 12:08.226
That's where.

12:13.357 --> 12:15.650
Do you have a favourite route?

12:17.570 --> 12:20.613
Put it in the kitchen,
I'll tidy up later.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.449
It'll feed you a week.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.452
No, my son's coming to lunch
tomorrow.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.120
All this for one meaI?

12:27.288 --> 12:31.833
No, I do his meals for the week
and he takes them home with him.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.252
He doesn't have a kitchen there.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.046
He can't even boiI an egg.

12:37.214 --> 12:41.009
That's him on the photo,
next to the rake.

12:41.177 --> 12:44.471
He's only happy
stuck at his computer.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.222
He works for IBM.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.016
To each his own...

12:48.184 --> 12:49.851
True. What about you?

12:50.019 --> 12:53.188
I drive.
But you had no time to notice.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.650
My son's taking his driving test
for the eighth time today!

12:59.361 --> 13:02.238
Eight's my lucky number,
he'll be okay.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.786
At the end of the street,
we'll turn...

13:11.665 --> 13:13.041
We'll turn left!

13:15.169 --> 13:16.628
Left, Mr Kermadec!

13:16.796 --> 13:18.296
Fucking turn!

13:18.839 --> 13:19.839
Are you stupid?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.969
I don't fucking believe it!

13:25.137 --> 13:27.639
I've never met a moron like you!

13:28.390 --> 13:30.642
You can't tell right from left?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.561
You said it too late.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.647
I'll fax you next time!

13:35.815 --> 13:37.232
Left is fucking left!

13:37.399 --> 13:39.859
Turning a wheeI is simple enough!

13:40.611 --> 13:41.945
To each his own...

13:42.446 --> 13:47.116
What does a cretin like you do?
Circus clown? Zoo-keeper?

13:47.284 --> 13:48.535
Dole officer?

13:48.702 --> 13:49.994
All three.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.416
You should've said...

13:55.584 --> 13:57.210
I'll fax you next time?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.670
Excuse me...

13:59.255 --> 14:01.589
What'll it be, Chief Inspector?

14:03.300 --> 14:04.759
Lovely...

14:05.177 --> 14:09.305
You deserve it. You've been so kind.
I'll keep your card.

14:09.557 --> 14:13.893
Do you mind if I eat in the car?
I ought to get to work.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.063
Not at all. Off you go!

14:24.446 --> 14:25.697
Can you save my life?

14:26.365 --> 14:27.699
In theory, no.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.161
It depends.
What are the symptoms?

14:32.454 --> 14:35.957
I have a flight in 25 minutes.
If I miss it, I'm dead.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.500
If I catch it, you'll be rich.

14:40.838 --> 14:41.796
Your luck's in.

14:43.215 --> 14:44.549
I'm not a doctor

14:45.634 --> 14:48.469
but I like emergencies.
Please fasten your belt.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.964
Let's get going...

15:30.804 --> 15:31.554
We're off.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.090
A white cab! Speeding!

16:07.257 --> 16:10.051
- It knocked down the radar.
- Okay, got the number?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.386
Too fast!

16:11.804 --> 16:14.597
Keep your eyes open on the job, paI.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.774
Will we make it?

16:24.942 --> 16:28.486
If I'm going to miss the plane,
we can take our time.

16:28.654 --> 16:32.573
Don't worry, we'll speed up
once we hit the freeway.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.682
Don't take any risks for me.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.226
I'd hate you to lose your licence.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.729
That's okay, I don't have one.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.566
Brilliant...

17:22.207 --> 17:23.790
14 and a half minutes.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.046
Time to buy a paper and have coffee.
Have a safe trip.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.399
I don't get it.

17:51.737 --> 17:56.616
I win at this every time.
Eight records at Monaco...

17:57.242 --> 17:59.827
But on the street, I come a cropper.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.289
Well, can we drink it?

18:03.582 --> 18:04.957
Not right away.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.419
I don't believe it!

18:08.587 --> 18:11.214
I know champagne ages well

18:11.381 --> 18:14.592
but this stuff's getting mouldy.
What was it this time?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.762
A butcher's for once,
not a news-stand.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.347
Know what?

18:20.057 --> 18:23.267
Get a mouse fitted in your car
instead of the wheeI.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.521
Handicapped people do that...

18:32.945 --> 18:33.694
Come on...

18:36.031 --> 18:38.324
I've got a new record for you.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.702
A cab, by the port...
Guess how fast.

18:41.870 --> 18:42.912
85?

18:43.163 --> 18:46.958
At first, then he changed gears.
135 mph, paI!

18:47.126 --> 18:48.292
You caught him?

18:48.460 --> 18:51.212
Sure, we called the airforce in.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.007
Heard this one? It's a blast.

18:55.175 --> 18:58.177
What's the difference
between a comb and a boiled egg?

19:02.724 --> 19:05.685
You're busy...
I'll call back later.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.688
Right! Much later.
After dark,

19:08.856 --> 19:10.356
we won't mind!

19:10.858 --> 19:12.775
And knock first next time!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.114
Petra...

19:19.908 --> 19:21.784
You're always welcome.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.995
Thanks, Emilien.
How did the test go?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.831
I hear you butchered it...

19:26.999 --> 19:28.708
News travels fast.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.293
I have news for you.

19:30.460 --> 19:34.088
There's a meeting
and you're the only one missing.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.381
No one said.

19:35.674 --> 19:39.177
You just need to press
that button there.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.387
The one marked "power".

19:41.555 --> 19:44.891
In my office, at the double!
Are you deaf?

19:45.058 --> 19:46.350
Not anymore.

19:46.518 --> 19:50.605
After raiding banks
in Holland, Italy and Belgium,

19:50.772 --> 19:52.690
the Mercedes Gang is in France.

19:52.858 --> 19:57.486
We won't let the Germans
invade our country again.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.782
My grandad died in the trenches,
this is a personaI matter.

20:01.950 --> 20:05.453
Stuff the Franco-German
speciaI relationship.

20:05.787 --> 20:06.996
Okay?

20:07.998 --> 20:11.626
Not you, Petra. You're German
but you're a cop so it's okay.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.254
These guys name the city
before attacking.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.839
It's too much!

20:17.007 --> 20:19.091
They'll do Marseilles
within three days!

20:19.259 --> 20:20.843
Full alert!

20:21.011 --> 20:22.428
On call around the clock!

20:23.388 --> 20:24.847
We have army back-up

20:25.015 --> 20:27.099
with one driver per team.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.270
Once the Germans leave the bank,
we taiI them.

20:31.438 --> 20:35.024
We'll stick to them,
acting like deadly venom.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.610
This is Operation...

20:39.738 --> 20:40.780
Cobra.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.659
Petra, pick the teams, please.

20:44.826 --> 20:49.372
3 per car. An army guy,
one of us and a sniper.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.501
Each team has a code name
and a posting on the plan.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.045
Team make-up is just next to it.

20:56.380 --> 20:58.589
Be in position in 50 minutes!

20:59.925 --> 21:02.718
Excuse me...
About that dinner I mentioned...

21:03.428 --> 21:06.472
This week would suit me because...

21:07.182 --> 21:09.517
That computer program I developed...

21:10.978 --> 21:13.604
If we wait, we may lose the idea,
you see?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.857
Not really.
What is it that can't wait?

21:17.025 --> 21:17.942
Me.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.444
No, the program, the computer...

21:21.446 --> 21:24.532
It's not easy here.
That's why I thought...

21:26.201 --> 21:27.451
about dinner...

21:29.413 --> 21:32.331
Once the Germans are in jaiI,
I promise

21:32.499 --> 21:34.792
I'll see to you... to your program!

21:34.960 --> 21:38.546
It's a deaI!
By the way, whose team are you on?

21:38.714 --> 21:39.880
Cobra's.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.758
You're lucky,
I've put you on the best team.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.125
We're out of coffee...

22:20.589 --> 22:22.465
Seen the wheeI? Fancy, huh?

22:22.632 --> 22:25.551
It's my own.
I bought if from Alain Prost.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.263
There's speciaI rally gears inside.

22:29.556 --> 22:32.641
You can drive through sand dunes
no problem.

22:33.810 --> 22:35.811
Too bad we're not at the beach.

22:36.438 --> 22:38.647
No ciggies, they make my eyes water.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.399
No coffee, no ciggies...

22:40.567 --> 22:41.233
No chicks!

22:45.781 --> 22:47.156
Boa to Grass Snake.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.033
Boa to Grass Snake, over.

22:49.201 --> 22:50.409
Grass Snake here.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.078
How's your team?

22:52.412 --> 22:54.205
Great. ReaI pals already.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.416
- And you?
- We're getting peed on...

22:59.211 --> 23:00.336
Hey, Rachid!

23:00.754 --> 23:03.047
We're gonna do that black Peugeot.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.509
Cut the crap, Marco,
not in broad daylight!

23:09.012 --> 23:10.346
The hell we can!

23:10.514 --> 23:12.598
The place is crawling with fuzz!

23:12.766 --> 23:15.893
Come back to the hood
and lift a car we know.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.647
It's okay, there's a summit,
the cops are at the airport.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.399
No fuzz in 40 miles.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.692
Fuck 'em, I say.

23:23.860 --> 23:24.735
Are you nuts?

23:24.903 --> 23:27.696
Fucking chill out!
They're at the airport.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.700
I saw it on TV.
Clinton, his missus, the Commies...

23:32.619 --> 23:33.285
Hey, fuzz!

23:33.453 --> 23:36.205
Marco fucks you!
Front, back and sideways!

23:36.915 --> 23:38.082
Let's book him!

23:38.250 --> 23:41.669
No, let him take the crate,
we need the space.

23:44.047 --> 23:45.714
I need to take a leak.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.175
We can't leave the car.
Those are orders.

23:51.596 --> 23:54.098
See? At the airport, like I said.

23:57.060 --> 23:59.437
Smile, you're on candid camera.

24:00.021 --> 24:02.857
If the Merc isn't here
in one minute,

24:03.024 --> 24:05.317
I'm having a ciggie, coffee
and a leak.

24:05.902 --> 24:07.445
You'll have to wait, paI.

24:13.910 --> 24:16.912
Calling all snakes.
No venom till the mouse is out.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.832
I repeat,
no venom untiI it's out.

24:20.000 --> 24:20.708
Sir...

24:20.876 --> 24:23.169
Not now, I'm into this...

24:23.336 --> 24:25.337
But it's the Minister.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.883
Aren't you at the airport, sir?

24:29.384 --> 24:32.803
We just finished.
About that Mercedes gang of yours...

24:33.805 --> 24:38.142
You've called at the right time.
We're about to arrest them.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.519
Good but I was just speaking

24:40.687 --> 24:43.105
- ... to my German counterpart.
- Don't worry.

24:43.273 --> 24:47.526
I'll be shipping
the Krauts home tomorrow

24:47.694 --> 24:48.694
by speciaI convoy!

24:48.862 --> 24:53.324
Don't let this turn into
a Franco-German brawI.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.783
The war's over.

24:54.951 --> 24:58.537
I couldn't agree more, sir,
really I couldn't.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.624
They'll be treated
like any other crooks.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.502
In that case,
don't call them Krauts.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.295
I said that?

25:08.632 --> 25:09.882
Did I say "Krauts"?

25:10.926 --> 25:12.676
A slip of the tongue, sir...

25:12.844 --> 25:14.011
Can I count on you?

25:14.179 --> 25:17.515
Yes. We handled the Gooks,
remember.

25:17.974 --> 25:21.602
The Asians, I mean.
That all went smoothly.

25:21.770 --> 25:25.105
Hardly any dead,
not on our side in any case.

25:30.946 --> 25:31.737
He hung up!

25:45.877 --> 25:47.169
Easy as pie.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.802
- Fuck, too many wires!
- Move it, Marco!

25:54.970 --> 25:57.263
Need the key to that crate, asshole?

26:02.060 --> 26:06.605
We're Grass Snake, right?
Grass makes you cooI...

26:06.773 --> 26:10.109
So we play it cooI, no venom, huh?

26:15.824 --> 26:19.076
Calling all snakes.
Get the maggots alive.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.869
For an hour at least.

26:26.543 --> 26:29.003
I'd better leave this to you guys.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.924
I've really got to go...

26:46.813 --> 26:48.147
What's going on?

26:48.481 --> 26:49.898
A shoot-out, sir.

26:52.652 --> 26:54.236
Don't move, sir.

27:03.330 --> 27:04.330
Fuck...

27:05.457 --> 27:08.125
We're being ambushed!
Send reinforcements!

27:12.047 --> 27:13.797
I've identified the car.

27:16.384 --> 27:19.345
I've identified
the accomplice's car.

27:19.679 --> 27:21.347
Four expert men inside.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.223
They're on their way.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.986
Oh, fuck...

28:02.889 --> 28:04.556
They're cops, sir.

28:08.311 --> 28:09.770
They're giving up?

28:13.358 --> 28:14.900
Grass Snake, over...

28:15.860 --> 28:18.404
We had a slight problem
with the door.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.116
We'll have you out of here shortly.

28:23.493 --> 28:25.119
No sweat, mister...

28:25.412 --> 28:26.620
Thank you.

28:28.581 --> 28:29.498
They give up.

28:33.086 --> 28:33.877
Funny...

28:34.045 --> 28:36.296
He kind of looks...

28:37.048 --> 28:38.924
a bit like the Minister.

28:43.638 --> 28:45.222
You haven't eaten...

28:45.390 --> 28:48.100
It's good but I'm just not hungry.

28:48.268 --> 28:49.977
Mom, that's enough!

28:50.395 --> 28:52.938
Don't worry about your test.

28:53.106 --> 28:56.233
Eight times is nothing.
Your father never passed.

28:56.401 --> 28:59.027
What? I remember him driving.

28:59.195 --> 29:03.574
He took the test 20 times
and in the end they gave him a licence.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.702
Thanks for the encouragement.

29:06.870 --> 29:07.619
You're welcome.

29:07.787 --> 29:11.623
Could you mend this
for the janitor's son?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.751
I'm not Super Mario!

29:13.918 --> 29:15.544
No, you're Super Cop!

29:15.712 --> 29:20.215
Upholding the law
and protecting honest citizens!

29:21.593 --> 29:24.762
You do wonderfuI work, sweetheart!

29:24.929 --> 29:26.472
I'm proud of you.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.349
So why say I work at IBM?

29:29.517 --> 29:32.728
So all the neighbours bring
their parking tickets round?

29:35.565 --> 29:38.358
So you work for IBM
and we get some peace.

29:38.526 --> 29:40.944
And I repair the kids' toys!

29:41.112 --> 29:41.987
Never happy...

29:42.530 --> 29:44.782
I'm just kidding...

29:44.949 --> 29:46.742
Can you call me a cab?

29:47.410 --> 29:51.914
I've found a great one.
Kind, friendly, a reaI angeI.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.624
You'll like him.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.713
- Wrong floor?
- Who are you looking for?

29:59.881 --> 30:00.798
Camille.

30:00.965 --> 30:02.674
That's me...
This is the place.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.843
You're her son who works for Apple?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.428
IBM.

30:07.806 --> 30:11.600
That's all Greek to me.
She showed me your photo...

30:13.520 --> 30:14.853
This is my boy, Emilien.

30:15.021 --> 30:18.440
I've labelled them.
Monday, veaI stew. Tuesday...

30:18.608 --> 30:20.400
I'll manage!

30:20.568 --> 30:23.445
Let's go,
I hate to leave my car alone.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.448
Kissy, mom.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.952
- Where to?
- Boulevard Voltaire.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.788
I know Police HQ but not IBM.

30:32.956 --> 30:34.665
I'm going to Police HQ.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.835
I'm computerizing them.

30:38.002 --> 30:42.214
I'll drop you a bit before,
I keep away from the fuzz.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.722
It makes a fancy noise...

30:51.349 --> 30:51.974
Expert?

30:53.059 --> 30:54.184
Amateur.

30:55.311 --> 31:00.023
I got a V6 and pepped it up
to make it sing. A V6 loves to sing.

31:00.567 --> 31:04.236
You can't sing too loud.
The limit's 30 here.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.654
Those signs?

31:07.365 --> 31:09.449
Aren't they for skateboards?

31:09.993 --> 31:11.743
No, for all vehicles.

31:11.911 --> 31:12.995
Maybe...

31:13.496 --> 31:17.541
I'm doing 60.
Good car, good driver, no sweat.

31:18.167 --> 31:20.961
I'm less of a danger than that jerk!

31:21.129 --> 31:21.962
Look!

31:26.342 --> 31:26.925
See that?

31:28.136 --> 31:29.636
Yeah, I saw...

31:30.597 --> 31:31.555
And speed-traps?

31:31.723 --> 31:35.225
We know where they are.
The pigs don't like change.

31:35.393 --> 31:39.021
They always feed at the same trough.
There's one just here...

31:39.981 --> 31:40.939
See them?

31:41.232 --> 31:42.608
What a load of jerks!

31:42.775 --> 31:44.359
Photo!

31:46.821 --> 31:49.823
They're just obeying orders.

31:49.991 --> 31:52.367
They signed up!
No one made them!

31:52.869 --> 31:56.079
Maybe they were made to.
No sane guy would!

31:56.664 --> 31:58.999
Look, I see a lot of them

31:59.167 --> 32:02.252
with the computers
and I had a false image of them.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.504
They're worse than people say?

32:06.883 --> 32:10.510
No, better in fact.
Not all cops are morons.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.140
I bet some are drunkards,
crooks or idiots.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.768
Sincerely, between you and me,

32:18.102 --> 32:22.314
know anyone in his right mind
who'd be a copper?

32:23.358 --> 32:24.441
And cab driver?

32:24.609 --> 32:25.776
What?

32:25.944 --> 32:30.155
Who'd be a cab driver?
Those slobs who never want to work.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.200
Who yell if you don't have change
or forget the tip.

32:33.993 --> 32:37.079
Always drinking
fit to burst a breathalyser.

32:37.246 --> 32:38.872
Always moaning away...

32:39.040 --> 32:41.959
And thick as thieves with the cops.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.252
The king grasses!

32:44.420 --> 32:47.798
If the guy's married to a janitor,
you're home free!

32:47.966 --> 32:49.841
Is your wife a janitor?

32:50.301 --> 32:51.802
That's something!

32:54.055 --> 32:58.934
Okay, some drivers are rude
but they're not all like that.

32:59.227 --> 33:02.270
So accept it's the same
on the force.

33:02.438 --> 33:05.857
They're not all blind drunk,
beating up immigrants.

33:06.025 --> 33:09.361
Some just do their job,
like you and me.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.822
Maybe...

33:12.240 --> 33:13.907
This isn't my reaI job.

33:15.201 --> 33:18.328
You drive a cab for fun?
So what's your reaI job?

33:18.496 --> 33:19.997
I'll show you.

33:49.861 --> 33:52.112
Got a bag? I don't feeI good.

33:52.822 --> 33:55.282
Don't worry,
nothing comes up till we stop!

34:06.419 --> 34:07.753
Shit...

34:08.963 --> 34:11.715
Sorry, that never happened before.

34:11.882 --> 34:16.511
My fares usually get out,
go somewhere and then...

34:18.723 --> 34:20.181
I'm really sorry.

34:20.808 --> 34:22.434
I'll tell you something.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.145
It's not my reaI job either.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.074
Full name?

34:38.242 --> 34:39.659
Morales, DanieI.

34:39.827 --> 34:42.829
Profession?
Speed maniac or just plain maniac?

34:43.539 --> 34:45.040
Put what you like.

34:46.542 --> 34:48.627
How fast were you going?

34:49.545 --> 34:50.795
55 or so...

34:52.547 --> 34:56.259
It just looked more
'cause it's a powerfuI motor.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.766
- Hi, Hot Wheels!
- Hi...

35:02.934 --> 35:04.893
Give me a break, okay?

35:05.561 --> 35:08.063
That taxi just did it again.

35:09.023 --> 35:09.981
120 mph.

35:10.858 --> 35:12.109
He's slowing down.

35:13.528 --> 35:14.986
See...

35:15.154 --> 35:18.073
You weren't doing 55.
You were doing 120!

35:20.368 --> 35:24.162
I know... It was the sun.
I couldn't see the speedometer.

35:24.330 --> 35:27.082
I didn't see
I was going that fast.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.209
I'd have slowed down otherwise.

35:29.377 --> 35:34.047
55's too fast.
The limit's 30. For everyone!

35:34.257 --> 35:36.258
Cars, skateboards, taxis,

35:36.425 --> 35:37.134
everyone!

35:37.301 --> 35:40.178
Satisfied? He's caught me,
done a good job,

35:40.346 --> 35:41.555
he's happy...

35:42.640 --> 35:46.810
Look, I drive to live.
Take my licence and I'm dead.

35:47.645 --> 35:50.981
So put me out of my misery
right now.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.651
Let me make the most of this.

35:54.819 --> 35:58.488
Usually, I screw up
so a lucky break's welcome...

35:58.948 --> 36:00.574
My wrist hurts too much to knock.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.034
Never mind... Knocking, I mean.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.538
That dinner and the program
that couldn't wait...

36:06.706 --> 36:11.168
They'll wait till I heaI. Unless
you want dinner with a scarecrow.

36:11.502 --> 36:12.794
I don't mind.

36:12.962 --> 36:15.672
I mean... You're perfect, Petra.
It doesn't matter.

36:16.716 --> 36:17.340
I mean...

36:18.050 --> 36:22.137
It does matter. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for you.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.931
For myself too.
But I don't mind.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.270
There!

36:31.480 --> 36:33.857
See, it's always like that.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.027
If only I could catch
those damn Germans.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.738
Can you finish me off?
It'll help.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.617
Yeah, I'll have to.

36:43.784 --> 36:46.161
Unless you have an idea?

36:47.121 --> 36:50.165
- I won't do it again.
- An idea, I said, not a joke.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.376
I mean a reaI idea.
For the public good.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.004
Cleaning up dog shit?

36:58.090 --> 37:00.967
Something for the public good
for me, see?

37:02.553 --> 37:06.306
I mean, it's as if I was the public

37:06.474 --> 37:09.226
and you did something for my good.

37:09.602 --> 37:10.894
Is that clear?

37:11.270 --> 37:12.562
You want dough?

37:12.730 --> 37:13.980
You're so dumb!

37:14.148 --> 37:18.276
Say what you want then.
Get to the point once and for all!

37:18.444 --> 37:19.569
What do you want?

37:21.697 --> 37:23.406
Heard of the Mercedes Gang?

37:23.574 --> 37:25.700
The gangs I know are on scooters.

37:25.868 --> 37:29.871
They raid banks. Yesterday was the 7th,
my chief's frantic.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.666
- That's a bummer...
- For us, it is.

37:33.042 --> 37:35.168
I'm gonna make you an offer.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.338
You know cars and I need a driver.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.716
That's good enough
to hire you as a trainee

37:41.884 --> 37:43.551
and wipe your slate clean.

37:44.053 --> 37:45.845
You want me to be a cop?

37:46.180 --> 37:48.056
Cop or pedestrian, you choose.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.559
Death or shame?

37:52.228 --> 37:53.311
You said it.

37:55.147 --> 37:57.774
Okay, these are the seven raids...

37:58.401 --> 37:59.526
in order.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.820
I'm more Ferrari than Mercedes.

38:01.988 --> 38:05.907
This the Mercedes Gang.
I'll let you know if they change.

38:07.243 --> 38:08.493
Red Mercs? Jesus!

38:08.661 --> 38:12.580
I know they're red.
See if there's anything we missed.

38:13.040 --> 38:14.791
We went over them in detaiI

38:15.251 --> 38:17.377
but maybe there's something.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.921
- There sure is.
- What?

38:20.339 --> 38:22.882
These guys are Germans.

38:24.427 --> 38:28.555
Brilliant! Germans in a Mercedes!
Need a rest after that?

38:28.973 --> 38:31.516
Over-inflated tyres,
typically German.

38:31.684 --> 38:36.146
They used 8-inch ones
and you can't get those in France.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.982
They'll need to change them soon.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.235
The exhaust's bent here,
but not here.

38:43.195 --> 38:47.115
They must have changed it.
Only Kruger can do that in Marseilles.

38:47.283 --> 38:49.701
And Kruger... is German.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.207
Good job you don't know Mercs...

38:58.044 --> 38:59.127
Where to then?

38:59.295 --> 39:02.547
Let's start with Kruger.
See how good his memory is.

39:07.845 --> 39:10.263
Waiting for the "Starsky and Hutch"
theme tune?

39:16.103 --> 39:18.605
I'd take the fairy lights off
around here...

39:19.523 --> 39:20.732
What now?

39:20.900 --> 39:25.403
This is how policemen
spend 90% of their time.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.072
Surveillance.

39:27.490 --> 39:30.867
Familiarity with the terrain,
observation of movement,

39:31.619 --> 39:32.577
analysis...

39:33.537 --> 39:36.414
At closing time,
we'll make a call on Kruger.

39:38.167 --> 39:40.335
What time does the garage close?

39:41.003 --> 39:43.004
Never. He has insomnia.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.551
Nothing but meat paste.

39:49.220 --> 39:52.180
Too bad,
my mom makes ace sandwiches.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.559
The ham and cheese one?
Half Italian, half Danish...

39:58.187 --> 40:00.355
- Perfect!
- She made you one?

40:02.942 --> 40:07.153
With the thin slices of cheese...
And the lettuce...

40:07.363 --> 40:09.406
And the baby pickles...

40:10.574 --> 40:11.408
Wild!

40:12.326 --> 40:13.034
It's mine!

40:13.452 --> 40:15.703
It's delicious. Congratulations.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.885
- What's going on?
- Koreans.

40:31.345 --> 40:34.889
They're ruining the trade.
They work around the clock.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.517
He has to sleep. He's human.

40:37.685 --> 40:39.144
Just watch this.

40:40.521 --> 40:43.231
One taxi, one plate, one licence...

40:45.401 --> 40:46.568
And two drivers!

40:47.069 --> 40:49.737
Try to tell one Korean from another.

40:50.906 --> 40:51.990
Unbelievable...

40:58.289 --> 41:02.625
I know a Korean nearby
but he's into cooking. Fancy that?

41:02.793 --> 41:04.752
We wait till the garage closes.

41:05.212 --> 41:08.256
We've got time.
He has insomnia, he never closes.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.676
How do you know?

41:12.678 --> 41:14.304
The bar owner told me.

41:14.763 --> 41:16.556
Why didn't you say?

41:16.932 --> 41:19.476
I don't think like a cop yet.

41:19.643 --> 41:23.146
That's not the problem.
It's just plain common sense!

41:23.564 --> 41:26.733
We're waiting
for an insomniac to go to bed!

41:26.901 --> 41:29.110
Does that sound right to you?

41:30.529 --> 41:33.948
If I drive that Merc
and know he's insomniac,

41:34.116 --> 41:36.576
I'll come here at night,
it's more discreet.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.872
You think he'll just turn up
with his fancy Merc?

41:50.758 --> 41:52.050
Unbelievable!

41:52.343 --> 41:55.053
Drivers spend their free time
in garages.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.096
Why here?

41:57.264 --> 42:00.141
To pick up the tyres
Kruger ordered for them.

42:00.476 --> 42:01.893
It's a miracle!

42:02.061 --> 42:03.937
I can't miss out on this.

42:04.104 --> 42:07.565
If there's trouble, call channeI 2
and give them the Merc's number.

42:07.733 --> 42:10.568
- What's going on?
- After surveillance, action!

42:10.736 --> 42:12.570
- I'll try the Korean trick.
- What?

42:12.738 --> 42:14.280
The Korean trick.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.580
What a jerk...

42:22.748 --> 42:24.541
Where do the tyres go?

42:28.671 --> 42:31.130
- What are you doing here?
- Me, sleep.

42:31.799 --> 42:34.259
Me, homeless, no house.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.094
My country very cold.

42:37.429 --> 42:40.306
No, please!
Not hurt me, I steaI nothing!

42:40.474 --> 42:41.724
Me, just sleep!

42:41.892 --> 42:44.686
I'll find you a place to sleep.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.605
And eat too, if you're lucky!

43:07.501 --> 43:10.086
- That hurts!
- I'm doing my best, chief.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.509
What's your name again?

43:17.469 --> 43:18.886
DanieI, right...

43:19.555 --> 43:20.805
I'm Emilien.

43:21.849 --> 43:23.683
First names are better.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.393
A bit better.

43:26.270 --> 43:29.522
Now we're so close,
we'll say that all this...

43:29.690 --> 43:32.734
the trash cans and so on,
never happened.

43:35.446 --> 43:38.865
If you let go of my hand,
can I go home and rest?

43:39.283 --> 43:42.076
I'm not insomniac or Korean.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.329
Sure...

43:49.168 --> 43:50.877
I waited all night.

43:51.045 --> 43:55.298
I did it so as you'd want me.
You won't regret it.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.216
Promises, promises...

43:58.469 --> 44:00.386
Give me an idea, just to see.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.436
Not bad!

44:08.604 --> 44:10.396
A little bit more.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.241
What's going on?

44:22.701 --> 44:24.410
It's not Sunday, it's Monday!

44:25.829 --> 44:27.914
You can't!
I held back all night!

44:28.415 --> 44:29.957
While I played dominoes?

44:31.085 --> 44:32.001
Call in sick.

44:32.169 --> 44:35.338
Monday morning disease?
My boss'll love that.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.048
I'm sure he's never heard of it!

44:37.216 --> 44:39.425
It can happen to anyone.

44:39.593 --> 44:41.511
You had dinner with your parents,

44:41.679 --> 44:44.263
you overate and threw up all night.
How's that?

44:45.057 --> 44:49.852
And a guy who works all week
and spends Sundays with his girI...

44:50.187 --> 44:51.062
How's that?

44:51.563 --> 44:53.064
I'm sorry, Lilly.

44:53.899 --> 44:55.775
I had a really shitty day.

44:55.943 --> 45:00.488
If you have dinner here with me,
I'll tell you everything.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.450
Keep it light then.

45:04.618 --> 45:07.662
No problem.
A quick dinner and a long night.

45:08.163 --> 45:10.498
We'll save time
by having dinner in bed.

45:10.916 --> 45:13.751
Make it good.
It's your last chance.

45:15.003 --> 45:16.295
I'll be ace!

45:21.009 --> 45:23.428
Another day outside the garage?

45:24.096 --> 45:26.723
Surveillance is over.
Questioning starts.

45:28.058 --> 45:30.685
Want to see
how an interrogation works?

45:31.645 --> 45:33.896
- You're coming anyway!
- I can't help!

45:34.064 --> 45:36.899
I'll stay here
in case there's trouble again.

45:37.067 --> 45:40.570
I need you to translate
for the technicaI stuff.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.740
Anyway,
he won't have time to trick me.

45:50.080 --> 45:51.456
Good morning!

45:52.416 --> 45:54.959
Which one of you is Mr Kruger?

45:55.377 --> 45:58.004
The name's on the wrapper.

46:00.048 --> 46:03.050
I have a few questions for you...

46:30.162 --> 46:31.412
I'm out of ammo!

46:31.580 --> 46:34.373
Who cares? They left an hour ago!

46:34.583 --> 46:37.335
Open your eyes!
The place is empty!

46:38.921 --> 46:40.046
They've gone.

46:42.299 --> 46:44.258
Can I ask you something?

46:44.426 --> 46:45.343
What?

46:45.511 --> 46:48.596
Does it always happen like that
or was that one for me?

46:48.764 --> 46:51.265
No, usually I get to ask
one question.

46:51.850 --> 46:54.560
Let's get some air.
It'll do us good.

46:55.145 --> 46:56.479
You saved my life.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.275
You get a reprieve.
Forget the month's training.

47:02.069 --> 47:04.612
I'll bring it down to one week.

47:04.988 --> 47:06.322
Very big of you...

47:06.490 --> 47:08.699
I have to catch them.

47:08.867 --> 47:10.451
Because of the blonde?

47:12.037 --> 47:15.122
Partly,
but mainly for myself, see?

47:15.290 --> 47:18.292
I'm sick of ending up in trash cans.
I'll pull this off!

47:18.460 --> 47:21.337
It's a matter of honour.
It's dumb but I have to!

47:21.505 --> 47:24.298
- Can I have the evening off?
- Of course...

47:25.259 --> 47:27.093
Have you finished with him?

47:28.053 --> 47:31.055
The doctor's doing me
a prescription.

47:31.223 --> 47:35.434
He stops at 5 and it's five to now.
My heart pills, you know.

47:36.270 --> 47:40.314
Don't worry, I'll have saved
the whole family today!

47:40.482 --> 47:42.108
You're so kind...

47:42.276 --> 47:43.442
I know...

47:56.498 --> 47:58.457
There they are, Johnny!

47:58.625 --> 48:00.293
No sweat, there's a bug

48:00.460 --> 48:02.169
in this round.

48:02.337 --> 48:03.880
They won't get away.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.506
You're so smart...

48:06.258 --> 48:07.633
It's my job, baby.

48:12.764 --> 48:14.682
Bull's-eye! You're great.

48:14.850 --> 48:16.058
Now, we follow...

48:16.560 --> 48:18.102
Brilliant!

48:20.188 --> 48:21.939
I'll never forget this.

48:22.399 --> 48:24.191
Just doing my job, baby.

48:32.284 --> 48:36.037
We've just had a call, gentlemen.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.415
They're fixing appointments now!

48:39.583 --> 48:42.627
They'll be doing
the Marseilles Bank next.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.963
I'll be as precise as they are.

48:46.131 --> 48:49.300
I won't tolerate any incidents
or misunderstandings.

48:49.468 --> 48:51.719
Perfect co-ordination.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.680
Two watchwords for the mission:

48:55.057 --> 48:56.349
Serenity...

48:57.684 --> 48:58.935
and efficacy.

49:00.395 --> 49:03.064
I've decided to call this operation

49:03.899 --> 49:05.274
"Operation...

49:07.194 --> 49:08.319
"Zen".

49:11.198 --> 49:12.281
Chief!

49:12.741 --> 49:15.451
Forget the snakes,
I've had a brainwave!

49:15.619 --> 49:20.247
We'll have them by tonight or
I'm not Emilien Coutan-Kermadec.

49:30.300 --> 49:31.926
I hope this works.

49:32.094 --> 49:33.970
It's your last round.

49:36.473 --> 49:38.766
You've got the round.
Over to you.

49:38.934 --> 49:40.351
Make sure you don't miss.

49:44.439 --> 49:45.439
Get down!

49:46.400 --> 49:48.526
Get down! Hands on your heads!

50:13.677 --> 50:14.468
It works.

50:15.137 --> 50:17.304
That's good... Very good.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.034
Follow at a distance.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.504
So you're not so scared.

51:07.731 --> 51:11.358
They've stopped. Rue Gauguin.
We've got them!

51:12.527 --> 51:14.737
Gibert here...

51:14.905 --> 51:17.907
Block all roads
within 6 miles of Rue Gauguin.

51:33.173 --> 51:35.925
They haven't moved.
We're almost there...

51:44.142 --> 51:45.643
What's wrong?

51:46.019 --> 51:47.978
I don't know. It's vanished.

51:48.146 --> 51:51.690
I can see it's vanished.
I want to know why!

51:51.858 --> 51:55.528
It must be around here.
You can't miss a red Merc.

52:11.503 --> 52:13.504
We're warm, I know we are...

52:15.799 --> 52:17.299
They should be here.

52:30.063 --> 52:32.022
Don't shoot, I'm the hostage!

52:42.117 --> 52:44.493
Hold on, I don't get this...

52:44.661 --> 52:48.038
A vanishing red Merc.
Even Copperfield can't do that.

52:53.545 --> 52:55.129
ID, please.

52:56.506 --> 52:58.132
A problem, officer?

52:58.633 --> 53:00.593
- Are you German?
- Yes... Why?

53:00.760 --> 53:02.845
Is this the border already?

53:03.638 --> 53:06.307
4 Germans in a Merc,
not a red one...

53:06.474 --> 53:07.266
I'll take it!

53:10.312 --> 53:11.604
German, are we?

53:11.771 --> 53:13.731
Yes. Is that a problem?

53:13.899 --> 53:16.775
Not at all, you interest me!
Open the trunk.

53:17.527 --> 53:18.777
Why're they here?

53:18.945 --> 53:23.032
They've come to spend marks
but can go elsewhere.

53:23.200 --> 53:26.493
Certainly not!
Keep it in the country!

53:34.085 --> 53:37.087
Auf Wiedersehen
and enjoy your trip.

53:42.928 --> 53:46.222
I don't get it,
I must have missed something.

53:47.057 --> 53:50.184
He forgot the kettle.
It happens a lot.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.229
You think so?
That's not like him...

53:56.399 --> 53:57.608
It's eight o'clock.

53:58.276 --> 54:01.028
The answering machine's on,
the alarm's set for six.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.697
We've got ten hours. Will that do?

54:03.865 --> 54:07.660
A bit short for what I have in mind
but we'll hurry.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.334
Expecting someone?

54:15.961 --> 54:18.420
My lover
but I cancelled him for you.

54:21.466 --> 54:22.967
Who the hell is it?

54:23.385 --> 54:25.469
Let them ring. They'll soon go...

54:25.637 --> 54:27.221
Where were we?

54:28.515 --> 54:29.807
I was kissing you.

54:30.725 --> 54:32.309
No, you were kissing me.

54:37.565 --> 54:40.150
- It might be important...
- What?

54:40.318 --> 54:42.111
I don't know... The cops or...

54:42.279 --> 54:45.531
You're a major crook
and they're here to arrest you!

54:45.699 --> 54:49.368
You could take me hostage.
Why not just take me?

54:51.746 --> 54:53.163
Open up! Police!

54:53.331 --> 54:55.124
You haven't killed anyone?

54:59.170 --> 55:00.963
Thank God, you're here!

55:01.673 --> 55:02.965
Brilliant!

55:03.133 --> 55:05.968
- I'm up shit creek...
- I can imagine.

55:06.970 --> 55:08.846
No, you've no idea.

55:09.931 --> 55:13.892
The apartment's gone,
that lovely apartment dad left us!

55:14.394 --> 55:16.228
Up in smoke, like dad.

55:16.396 --> 55:21.066
My husband smoked and died
of liver cancer although he never drank.

55:22.527 --> 55:26.030
The apartment doesn't matter.
I fouled up again.

55:26.197 --> 55:29.700
I've got till the end of the week
or I'm back on traffic duty!

55:29.868 --> 55:32.453
Stick, whistle, the works!

55:32.954 --> 55:34.955
Monday, I'm a dead man.

55:38.126 --> 55:40.002
- Who's this dwarf?
- A paI.

55:40.545 --> 55:41.837
You go for muppets?

55:42.005 --> 55:44.631
- It's complicated, he's a cop...
- What?

55:45.133 --> 55:48.010
- A paI who's a cop?
- Well, no, I work for him...

55:48.178 --> 55:50.387
- You work for the cops?
- No!

55:50.555 --> 55:52.973
I work for him. He's not a reaI cop.

55:53.141 --> 55:57.353
Look at him, he looks more like
a secret agent or something.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.064
And she's Mata Hari?

56:00.940 --> 56:04.109
Can someone explain to her?
I can't!

56:04.277 --> 56:06.320
My name's Camille, hello.

56:06.488 --> 56:09.698
The muppet there
is my son, Emilien.

56:09.866 --> 56:14.661
If you show me the kitchen,
I'll make great coffee and explain.

56:14.829 --> 56:18.582
There's nothing to explain.
I'm finished!

56:19.125 --> 56:21.335
I started out okay...

56:22.420 --> 56:25.631
But with the trash cans...
the butcher's shops...

56:26.383 --> 56:29.968
You shelter the homeless?
Want me to call the reaI cops?

56:30.136 --> 56:32.513
Don't make things any worse.

56:32.680 --> 56:34.473
I'm not...

56:34.641 --> 56:38.268
I'd just like to finish
what we started.

56:38.436 --> 56:41.438
It's a tight schedule,
let's not waste time.

56:41.606 --> 56:45.067
I got caught speeding
and I mean speeding.

56:45.235 --> 56:47.736
He could revoke my licence
for 100 years.

56:47.904 --> 56:51.615
I'm helping him out to get it back.
100 years on the dole...

56:52.575 --> 56:57.246
Cop, blackmailer, muppet...
Some mothers do have them!

56:57.872 --> 57:00.165
Here, it was a stupid idea.

57:00.500 --> 57:01.834
You're free.

57:04.546 --> 57:05.421
Seriously.

57:06.381 --> 57:08.298
Here, you're free.

57:14.389 --> 57:17.641
I didn't come here
because of our deaI.

57:18.768 --> 57:20.853
I've got no other friends.

57:21.771 --> 57:23.147
Mom said...

57:26.317 --> 57:29.278
"DanieI's kind-hearted,
he'll help us out. "

57:36.119 --> 57:38.996
I think we were wrong
but that's okay.

57:42.333 --> 57:44.501
It's our problem anyway.

57:45.795 --> 57:48.881
Don't worry,
I'll arrest the gang alone.

57:52.051 --> 57:54.219
On foot, it won't be easy.

57:55.263 --> 57:56.472
But I'll manage.

58:03.271 --> 58:06.440
We can get rid of him
by helping him out.

58:06.608 --> 58:09.234
He needs a lot more than help!

58:09.402 --> 58:11.320
He's a psychopath!

58:11.488 --> 58:14.531
He reminds me
of The Silence of the Lambs!

58:15.200 --> 58:19.828
Take Mata Hari, I'll take the muppet
and I'll be back in 2 hours.

58:19.996 --> 58:22.873
You want me to play bingo
with the old bag?

58:26.044 --> 58:28.212
Two hours or I'll set fire to her!

58:28.379 --> 58:29.338
It's a deaI!

58:30.423 --> 58:31.381
Come on.

58:31.549 --> 58:33.592
- Where to?
- To see to you...

58:36.554 --> 58:39.431
I'm sorry we spoiled your evening.

58:40.642 --> 58:42.392
Is your coffee really good?

58:43.061 --> 58:44.353
The best in town!

58:58.159 --> 58:59.618
To ease the atmosphere

58:59.786 --> 59:01.453
and apologize.

59:06.793 --> 59:10.587
You don't want to talk to me
but listen anyway.

59:11.005 --> 59:12.839
- Okay?
- Will one minute do?

59:13.466 --> 59:17.886
I've been thinking all night
and there's one thing I don't get.

59:18.304 --> 59:20.138
Why do they taunt us like this?

59:20.807 --> 59:22.849
Why red
when grey is more discreet?

59:23.893 --> 59:27.062
To draw our attention.
We look this way...

59:27.814 --> 59:29.481
while they go that way.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.692
A "diversion".

59:31.901 --> 59:36.989
They left the bank empty-handed
and got the money out another way.

59:37.949 --> 59:40.033
Or it's still in the bank.

59:44.205 --> 59:46.290
One minute. Time's up.

59:53.464 --> 59:54.965
I'll be back later.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:28.915
Ten grand.

01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:32.878
That'll keep you going for a while.

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.087
My wife?

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:37.299
You really want her?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.594
I'm kind of used to her...

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.645
Calm down, sweetheart...

01:00:52.273 --> 01:00:54.608
Everything will be okay now.

01:01:02.116 --> 01:01:03.909
One more

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.994
and we retire.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:08.664
For our finaI job,

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:12.292
we'll go out with a bang!

01:01:22.553 --> 01:01:23.845
Pain in the ass.

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:27.474
Will it help if I tell you
how they changed cars?

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.518
Maybe... So tell me.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:32.437
They didn't,
they changed the colour.

01:01:33.231 --> 01:01:36.692
A red Merc drives
into a car-park or whatever

01:01:37.443 --> 01:01:40.737
and a discreet, grey Merc
comes back out and vanishes.

01:01:40.905 --> 01:01:43.281
- Can that be done?
- Easy as pie.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:47.160
If they resprayed it,
there'd be paint somewhere.

01:01:47.995 --> 01:01:51.248
Not if they resprayed it
inside a truck.

01:01:52.333 --> 01:01:54.876
They'd need tons of paint each time!

01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:58.088
They'd work in record time,
less than 10 minutes.

01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:00.882
Can paint dry in that time?

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:04.219
Gégé? Sorry I woke you,
it's DanieI.

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:08.014
I need some
of your MD10 magic paint.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.183
Colour... scarlet.

01:02:11.644 --> 01:02:13.103
You're out of stock?

01:02:13.771 --> 01:02:16.481
Who bought that much scarlet
in one go?

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.817
The Etangs track?

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:22.779
Are they repainting
the whole track red or what?

01:02:23.948 --> 01:02:26.950
Okay, I'll work something out
with them.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.703
I'll call you. See you.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:33.707
What's MD10 paint?

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:35.584
Dry in 10 minutes.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:50.891
What d'you think?

01:02:57.356 --> 01:02:58.023
Is that them?

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.193
No, they're the Marseilles
Butcher's League!

01:03:03.696 --> 01:03:05.781
What's the next move?

01:03:06.699 --> 01:03:08.617
- What's going on?
- We'll say hello.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.495
- They'll spot us!
- They won't forget us.

01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:15.332
They'll recognize me!
They saw me in their trunk!

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.709
- Put this on!
- You jerk!

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:20.962
How's this?

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:23.632
Perfect.

01:03:26.135 --> 01:03:29.346
You fairies think you're Schumacher?

01:03:29.931 --> 01:03:32.015
Doing a little lap or two?

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:33.934
Who made those karts?

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:35.811
Mercedes?

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.146
They do cars now?

01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.816
Want to play hare, Hermann?

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:42.609
I'll show you how.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.277
Give me 500.

01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:46.863
I'd better get out.

01:03:47.031 --> 01:03:49.741
I'll show you,
I bet they'll go for it.

01:03:50.034 --> 01:03:52.577
Here's how we play hare.

01:03:53.037 --> 01:03:56.498
500 francs for the guy
who beats me over two laps.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.376
- You can count?
- We don't need money.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:04.256
I don't want to take more than 500.
A tourist who doesn't get scammed

01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:05.715
isn't a tourist.

01:04:05.883 --> 01:04:07.008
Listen...

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:09.928
Use the rear-view on the second lap
to see if I'm there.

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.306
No sense in doing a lap for nothing.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.611
Thanks, girls.

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.991
Piss off!

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.158
Fast!

01:04:34.495 --> 01:04:37.330
This is fun
but I have to get to a garage.

01:04:37.498 --> 01:04:39.291
The car's reaI slow today...

01:04:41.961 --> 01:04:43.879
Any time you want a replay...

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.176
Here, 500!

01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:52.929
- What do we do now?
- Go for a drink.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.018
Frogs!

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.521
Are you nuts?
We had them and you show off.

01:05:01.689 --> 01:05:04.691
We could have called the guys
and booked them.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.568
What for?

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.320
Speeding on a track?

01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:10.697
We can always find evidence after.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:15.118
Hold on, didn't you tell me
we had to catch them red-handed?

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:17.704
Maybe but we're getting nowhere.

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:21.166
If this goes on,
we'll end up inside.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.837
You'll get what you want.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.881
They're white hot now.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:30.300
Drivers are reaI gamblers.

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:32.844
We can set the trap now.

01:05:33.471 --> 01:05:35.889
- What sort of trap?
- A booby trap!

01:05:36.057 --> 01:05:38.016
How does your booboo trap work?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.393
A booby trap, not a booboo trap!

01:05:40.561 --> 01:05:42.395
So how does it work?

01:05:42.563 --> 01:05:46.858
We wrap them round our finger
and get them where we want them.

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:49.235
In other words, here.

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:53.615
I'll need 20 traffic light keys
and 20 radios.

01:05:57.787 --> 01:06:01.665
Okay for the radios.
But the guys keep the keys on them.

01:06:01.832 --> 01:06:03.833
Except when they shower.

01:06:38.369 --> 01:06:39.703
Brilliant!

01:06:40.496 --> 01:06:41.955
Over to you, Jimmy.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.005
I'm freezing.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.464
Just a second.

01:06:51.632 --> 01:06:53.425
Heard this one...

01:06:54.218 --> 01:06:56.011
You're in the raw?

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:02.058
I'm not in the raw,
I've got a toweI on.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:08.398
And what if I was?
I can strip down in my office.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.108
This is my office?

01:07:10.609 --> 01:07:13.528
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to knock?

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:16.281
Your mom only taught you to be dumb?

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:19.451
What a welcome!
I had a great joke for you.

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:22.162
Your jokes are never funny!
Get out!

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:27.709
I enjoyed that.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:31.671
Come in!

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.134
Am I in the way?

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:37.260
Never!

01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:41.222
I can tell I am.
I'll call by later.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:47.437
See? She comes in for once,
with something to tell me

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:50.690
and I'm in the raw in here.
Can you believe it?

01:07:51.692 --> 01:07:53.735
What can I say? In any case,

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:57.989
she's too good for me.
She's already Chief Inspector...

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.200
What could she see in me?

01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:03.620
Have you finished your moaning?

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.498
You're digging your grave
with your teeth!

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:10.627
That chick's no charity worker.
She isn't dieseI-powered.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.087
She needs a man!

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:15.924
Stand up, you look more
like a monkey than a man!

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.425
Stand up straight!

01:08:18.719 --> 01:08:19.803
There!

01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:23.890
Now, go and see her,
fling her back and snog her!

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:25.558
It'll be a slap

01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:29.520
or ten years together after that!
It's fifty-fifty.

01:08:29.688 --> 01:08:34.024
If not, you know right away.
Like those lottery scratch cards.

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.319
Are you okay?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.283
You're right, I need to know.

01:08:43.452 --> 01:08:46.621
One scratch and I'm home free!

01:09:00.426 --> 01:09:01.928
Fifty-fifty...

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.971
He'll wait for the draw now.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:07.142
How's it going?

01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:08.475
Finished.

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.398
Will they be mad?

01:09:14.274 --> 01:09:17.569
If a chick turns up 17 hours late,
what do you do?

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:21.029
- I kill her.
- That answers your question.

01:09:21.198 --> 01:09:23.158
We brought flowers though.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.536
- Pretty flowers!
- Can you smoke them?

01:09:30.707 --> 01:09:31.957
You made those cakes?

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:37.255
Since neither of us make love anymore,
we made cakes.

01:09:38.924 --> 01:09:40.466
What a riot!

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:44.470
I've had a great day with you.

01:09:44.638 --> 01:09:46.014
You'll call me?

01:09:46.182 --> 01:09:47.307
I promise.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:54.104
Are these for me? Thanks.
See you.

01:09:56.775 --> 01:09:58.902
Fancy an evening together?

01:09:59.069 --> 01:10:04.073
Look after your guests. Next time.
A few years won't change much.

01:10:04.783 --> 01:10:07.076
I put Camille in your bed,
she has a bad back.

01:10:10.956 --> 01:10:12.665
Good night, boys!

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.509
This stuff's good...

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.553
You bet, it's Jamaican.

01:10:25.846 --> 01:10:27.555
One of the perks...

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.265
You're tempting me!

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.354
Why not drive a racing car
instead of a cab?

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:40.109
My dad's in a wheelchair
since a crash.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:44.197
Try telling him you want to race.

01:10:44.865 --> 01:10:46.699
Yeah, not easy...

01:10:46.867 --> 01:10:47.492
And you?

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.910
What went wrong?

01:10:50.454 --> 01:10:52.205
My story's a good one too.

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:56.626
I was 17 when dad died.
Mom and I were penniless.

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:58.836
I had to find a job.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:02.048
The force takes anyone
who can count to ten.

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:06.427
Where did you live?

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.804
Asnières.

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:09.806
Jules Ferry?

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:11.266
Yes, why?

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.226
You too?

01:11:14.812 --> 01:11:15.937
Honestly...

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:18.398
Crazy!
We could've been in the same class!

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:22.986
I'd have taught you to steaI
and you'd have turned out okay.

01:11:25.823 --> 01:11:29.701
That's life.
Kids have all kinds of dreams...

01:11:30.536 --> 01:11:31.786
that never work out.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:37.292
You want to be centre forward
and end up in goaI.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:41.379
Think the plan'll work?

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.591
Like clockwork.

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.012
Are you sure?

01:11:50.347 --> 01:11:51.431
Come in!

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:55.018
Am I disturbing you?

01:11:57.062 --> 01:11:59.522
It's okay. What's up?

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:00.940
Full alert!

01:12:06.071 --> 01:12:08.740
We've launched the Cougar Plan.

01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.492
The SDLM Bank this time.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:13.870
Here are your positions.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:17.206
Arthur, street-corner nº 1...

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:20.126
Jacky, street-corner nº 2...

01:12:24.548 --> 01:12:25.840
Nº 2 Manu: radio and key...

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:28.092
Nº3 Vincent: radio and key...

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.371
- I know... Back in an hour.
- Right.

01:12:57.289 --> 01:12:58.831
I'll be at your place.

01:13:19.436 --> 01:13:22.105
Cougar here...
The bird is in the cage.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.733
On your knees!

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:35.535
Cougar here. The bird's coming out.
Prepare to pounce.

01:13:37.371 --> 01:13:38.663
They've got hostages!

01:13:38.831 --> 01:13:40.957
Don't do anything yet!

01:13:42.126 --> 01:13:43.709
Sorry, no room for you.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:45.128
I can wait...

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:50.633
You can run alongside.
It'll do you good.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:52.802
I haven't warmed up...

01:14:02.146 --> 01:14:05.815
Calling all cougars! Pounce!
Catch the bird!

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.341
See, don't follow the Mercedes...

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:34.927
Follow the truck instead.

01:14:35.095 --> 01:14:37.388
Let's drink to a job well done!

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:39.432
Now, home everyone.

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:55.907
Here we go...

01:15:05.375 --> 01:15:06.667
Everything ready?

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:07.919
20 points covered.

01:15:08.212 --> 01:15:10.421
If they cross one line,
they're finished.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:13.799
Boulevard Michelet
to Place Mazard...

01:15:13.967 --> 01:15:15.927
Who's on that corner?

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:18.137
- Jean-Bat, nº 7.
- Call him.

01:15:18.305 --> 01:15:19.722
He'll open the dance.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.849
Nº 7...
Jean-Bat, d'you receive me?

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:23.601
Go ahead.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:24.936
You're the first.

01:15:25.771 --> 01:15:26.896
I'm in position.

01:15:27.064 --> 01:15:28.606
Our turn now.

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:33.319
You can't get through!

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:34.820
I can...

01:15:36.156 --> 01:15:37.240
Hi, Gretchen...

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.492
Still got that tractor?

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:43.704
Sorry I was so slow last time,
I left the handbrake on.

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:48.292
I'm talking to you!
Want to try again or stay pathetic?

01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:50.002
Okay, okay...

01:15:50.754 --> 01:15:53.506
You French are always bragging...

01:15:53.674 --> 01:15:56.133
- Come onto the freeway...
- You're mad now...

01:15:56.301 --> 01:15:59.262
- I'll wipe your Peugeot out.
- I'm sorry...

01:15:59.429 --> 01:16:04.058
I'll give you a chance
but I won't wager a lot.

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.018
I hate making such easy money.

01:16:06.186 --> 01:16:08.145
Here, ten francs.

01:16:08.939 --> 01:16:10.147
You'll pay for that!

01:16:10.607 --> 01:16:11.941
Who'll pay who?

01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.113
You're going too far...

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:19.907
No way.
Tell 7, 8 and 9 to switch to red.

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:21.659
Switch to red.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:47.685
Nº 10, in position.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:49.270
Nº 11, in position.

01:16:49.438 --> 01:16:51.814
Okay, 12 and 13, get ready...

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.486
Nº 13 in position
but I have a problem...

01:16:58.822 --> 01:17:00.156
Two cops at the light.

01:17:00.824 --> 01:17:01.490
Oh, fuck!

01:17:01.658 --> 01:17:02.825
Get rid of them!

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.911
Easier said than done!

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:13.544
We're at 11. Do something!

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:17.048
Put them on!

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.427
Excuse me, a call for you...

01:17:22.846 --> 01:17:25.306
Crime Squad here. There's a bomb

01:17:25.474 --> 01:17:27.058
just next to you.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.018
- Where?
- In the light!

01:17:29.686 --> 01:17:32.021
Don't panic. We can stop it.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:36.442
Listen carefully. Use the key
to switch the light to red.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:37.443
It's already red!

01:17:37.778 --> 01:17:41.197
I don't give a damn!
Put the key in the box

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:43.366
and turn to the right! Got that?

01:17:53.877 --> 01:17:55.252
We just passed 12.

01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:57.421
Get a move on...

01:17:58.298 --> 01:17:59.423
May I?

01:18:02.594 --> 01:18:05.596
19 and 20, get ready.
You know 20's the last?

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:06.972
I know.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:22.738
- What's this?
- A short-cut!

01:19:26.052 --> 01:19:29.346
We'll wipe him out on the freeway,
we've got more power.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:11.180
Maybe that barrier meant something.

01:20:11.348 --> 01:20:13.224
The road's not finished.

01:20:16.186 --> 01:20:18.229
As long as you know...

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:23.692
I may look calm
but I'm a nervous wreck...

01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:24.652
Almost over...

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.570
Exactly, I want to live.

01:20:26.738 --> 01:20:27.488
Ten seconds.

01:20:27.781 --> 01:20:29.448
Crush that rat!

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:32.535
Stop! No more bridge!

01:20:32.702 --> 01:20:33.661
5 seconds.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.790
Go on, crush him!

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:42.169
Let them win!
You bet 10 francs!

01:20:42.337 --> 01:20:45.214
- We can't die for 10 francs!
- Now or never... Hold on!

01:20:55.559 --> 01:20:58.519
Well done, KarI. We've won.

01:20:59.437 --> 01:21:00.688
Are you sure?

01:21:10.907 --> 01:21:13.367
You gave me a reaI fright...

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.121
I thought you wanted to die.

01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:20.416
Read "The Tortoise and the Hare".
The tortoise wins.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:24.086
Hey, Einstein!
Heard of Aesop?

01:21:34.180 --> 01:21:38.726
Big hare angry
little tortoise fucked him over!

01:21:39.519 --> 01:21:41.770
Cougar's going to be pleased.

01:21:41.938 --> 01:21:45.232
He loves a bit of jugged hare.

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:11.133
Sorry about this place.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.844
It's not romantic...

01:22:14.804 --> 01:22:16.805
- But I wanted you.
- You did?

01:22:17.557 --> 01:22:19.558
I can't say I noticed.

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:23.896
Action replay?

01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:29.610
Later.
We've really got to go.

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.700
I've been looking everywhere
for you!

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.745
- What were you doing?
- Developing photos.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:43.749
Photos? You have to do that now?
The Commissioner's waiting!

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.259
The French President

01:22:54.427 --> 01:22:58.597
awards you the medaI
of Knight of the Order of Merit.

01:23:05.563 --> 01:23:06.814
Congratulations.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.616
I owe you an apology.

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:20.160
For not believing me
or for slapping my face?

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:22.788
Both...
How can I ever apologize?

01:23:25.583 --> 01:23:27.209
We'll work something out.

01:23:29.087 --> 01:23:31.380
I read about your exploits.

01:23:32.215 --> 01:23:33.465
Astounding!

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.510
You've given us
a lot to think about.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:42.391
We're going to change our approach
to traffic completely.

01:23:42.559 --> 01:23:45.686
More efficient and modern,
thanks to you.

01:23:46.896 --> 01:23:51.734
The medaI is just a symboI,
it won't get you your licence back.

01:23:51.901 --> 01:23:53.652
I expected a bit more...

01:23:53.820 --> 01:23:55.404
- Leniency?
- Right!

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:59.324
We are lenient. We could lock you up
for years but you're free.

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.076
I'm not free, I'm on foot!

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:04.705
I understand. Without a car,
you're an orphan?

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.623
Right, an orphan on foot.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:07.875
I understand.

01:24:08.334 --> 01:24:11.295
There is one solution
but it may not suit you.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:15.340
Try me, we'll soon see.

01:24:26.352 --> 01:24:27.811
Okay? Happy?

01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:30.898
- You're not happy?
- I'm fine...

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:35.194
I don't get it.
Grand Prix, first line, great car...

01:24:35.361 --> 01:24:37.613
Your pals. What more do you want?

01:24:37.989 --> 01:24:39.948
Another sponsor!

01:24:41.034 --> 01:24:45.287
We give him money, a car
and he's still not happy...

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:52.211
Tell the pom-pom girls to cut it out.
They ruin my concentration.

01:24:52.796 --> 01:24:55.672
You know what would make me happy?

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:56.673
What?

01:24:56.841 --> 01:25:00.135
Just win the race,
forget the shit on the car.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:05.933
Get the champagne out of the fridge,
it's no good too cold.
