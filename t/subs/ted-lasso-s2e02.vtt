00:17.809 --> 00:20.521
The audience at home has voted.

00:20.604 --> 00:25.609
Danthony, Jamie.
One of you will go home tonight.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.237
The other will continue
his lustful journey.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.822
Better call your nan, mate.
Tell her to put the kettle on.

00:37.621 --> 00:38.622
Jamie.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.838
The lust stops here.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.590
I'm sorry.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.301
Whoo-hoo! Yes!

00:51.385 --> 00:52.386
What?

00:52.469 --> 00:55.264
-Thank you. Oy, thank you!
-Wow.

00:55.347 --> 00:57.558
-It's bull****.
-Thank you!

01:00.102 --> 01:01.770
That is an absolute shocker.

01:01.854 --> 01:02.855
Unlucky, really.

01:02.938 --> 01:06.650
Yeah, but we are lucky to have with us,
here in the studio, loser, Jamie.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.820
Easy, Phillip.
I'm not just a loser, I'm the loser.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.282
Well, Jamie, look, first things first,
will you keep your promise to Amy?

01:13.365 --> 01:15.409
-Are you gonna wait for her?
-Nah, no.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.870
I was just playing a game,
do you know what I mean?

01:17.953 --> 01:19.079
Find the fittest girl there,

01:19.162 --> 01:21.832
have sex with her in the toilet,
ask her to marry ya. Strategy.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.837
Well, speaking of strategy,
you decided to leave your club, Man City,

01:26.920 --> 01:29.339
right at the start of their season.
So why?

01:30.132 --> 01:32.176
Just something I had to do,
do you know what I mean?

01:32.259 --> 01:35.345
The second that I found out
that George Harrison had died,

01:35.429 --> 01:38.348
I realized that I had to stop
waiting for life to begin.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.851
Start taking chances.
Living life to the fullest.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.021
But George Harrison died 20 years ago.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.273
Yeah, but I only just found out.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.485
So what's next for Jamie Tartt?

01:50.986 --> 01:54.364
Don't know. Back to Man City.
If Pep will have me, that is.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.450
It's funny you mention that
'cause we've got a clip.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.076
You might find this quite interesting.

01:58.160 --> 02:01.163
Any thoughts on Jamie Tartt
and his future with Manchester City?

02:01.246 --> 02:02.873
Yes, Jamie.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.585
You know, my wife and I thought he and Amy
were meant for each other.

02:07.211 --> 02:09.880
But no,
he won't be coming back to Man City.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.131
We wish him luck.

02:18.639 --> 02:21.517
Well, thanks for stopping by, Jamie.
Good to see you, as always.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.769
When we come back,
have scientists really discovered

02:23.852 --> 02:25.812
low-fat custard that doesn't make you sad?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.147
Sounds too good to be true.

02:35.614 --> 02:38.575
Hey! Jamie! Jamie!

02:38.659 --> 02:40.911
Yeah, yeah. Of course, yeah.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.331
-Thank you so much…
-Yeah. All right, yeah.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.041
-How's it going, yeah?
-You all right, bro?

02:46.124 --> 02:48.669
-Yeah.
-Sorry you got sacked, man.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.380
It's how the crisp crumbles.

02:51.463 --> 02:56.552
Thanks, man. Thanks, bruv. There.
Nah, you good, man. Yeah, yeah.

02:56.635 --> 02:57.761
Hello, mate. How you doing?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.304
-What's your name?
-Stanley.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.431
Stanley. And you like football, yeah?

03:01.515 --> 03:03.809
-Thank you, Jamie.
-All right. No worries, man. Yeah.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.894
All right, see ya later. Nice to meet ya.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.858
I actually think I'm gonna walk, mate.
Yeah? Nice one.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.305
Hold on. You slept here last night?

03:41.847 --> 03:42.931
Why?

03:43.015 --> 03:46.018
Jane and I got in a fight last night,
and she threw my keys in the river.

03:46.101 --> 03:49.229
Hey, you two are like Frank Sinatra
and Ava Gardner, you know?

03:49.313 --> 03:53.775
Or Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow.
Or Frank and-- Actually, you know what?

03:53.859 --> 03:57.070
I'm starting to realize that Ol' Blue Eyes
might've skewed mercurial.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.781
-Hey, what time is it?
-9:20.

04:00.449 --> 04:02.034
Right. I'll be back.

04:02.117 --> 04:05.162
No, no, no. Smell this.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.539
A Parisian bedroom.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.003
Will, a word.

04:20.302 --> 04:22.596
-Yeah, come in.
-You all right?

04:22.679 --> 04:23.680
No, I'm not all right.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.058
Did you put lavender-scented
fabric softener in the laundry?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.142
Yes. Yes, I did.

04:27.226 --> 04:30.145
My girlfriend loves lavender.
She finds it very calming.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.192
Don't make changes that could
throw off a player's headspace.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.693
Sorry, Coach.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.903
Go. Get out.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.700
We don't want calm athletes.
We want killer athletes.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.993
Even after they shower?

04:46.453 --> 04:47.454
Did you sleep here?

04:47.538 --> 04:49.206
"Perchance to dream here."

04:50.791 --> 04:53.544
Thanks for the ride, babe.
Do you wanna pop in? Say hi?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.045
-No.
-Okay.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.130
What you got planned today?

04:57.714 --> 04:59.424
Nothing till the match later.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.970
I'm going to get the girls to run
a 4-4-2 diamond formation

05:03.053 --> 05:07.307
'cause that little Kokoruda girl
is a fucking beast in defense.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.352
Then I was going to cook you
cordon bleu for dinner.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.981
Nigella says if you butterfly the chicken,
it'll be more moist.

05:14.565 --> 05:16.733
I don't know what does it for me more,

05:16.817 --> 05:19.611
you mentioning Nigella
or using the word "moist."

05:22.656 --> 05:23.657
Yeah!

05:23.740 --> 05:26.076
-Yeah, all right. This is good.
-What is Ted doing?

05:26.159 --> 05:29.663
He's probably homesick.
Closest thing he can find to a Dodge Ram.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.708
-Good luck with the match, yeah?
-I appreciate you.

05:34.793 --> 05:35.794
Morning, Ted!

05:35.878 --> 05:39.339
Hi, Keeley! Uh-oh,
is that big, bad Roy Kent in there?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.801
Sorry. He's in a big rush.

05:42.885 --> 05:45.262
That's okay. Hey, you know,
"mime is money," right?

05:46.138 --> 05:48.348
-That looked like fun.
-Oh, yeah. No, that's a blast.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.518
And it's good for my sciatica too.
The vibrations really help out my butt.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.438
-Wow.
-Hey, look who's here.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.522
Hey.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.901
That's a cool bike.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.904
That's not a bike, that's a transformer.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.531
Yeah, she really is
more than meets the eye, ain't she.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.742
Hey, Doc …tor Sharon!

06:06.825 --> 06:07.910
Good morning.

06:07.993 --> 06:11.038
What's she doing back here, I wonder?
Don't we have direct deposit?

06:11.121 --> 06:13.999
I thought Higgins hired her
for the rest of the season, didn't he?

06:19.546 --> 06:22.758
Hey, Higgins. Did you hire Dr. Sharon
without running it by me first?

06:22.841 --> 06:24.092
Yes. I thought it couldn't hurt.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.470
But I should've asked you first, Ted.
You're absolutely right.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.013
No, I'm dead wrong.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.557
I mean, heck, you're
Director of Football Operations.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.601
You gotta be able to
make your own decisions.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.228
Still, you should've texted me first.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.146
-That's 100% true.
-No, 1,000% false!

06:36.230 --> 06:37.606
I mean, you're a busy man!

06:37.689 --> 06:39.525
Whatever path you think is best
is gonna be best!

06:39.608 --> 06:43.195
Still, next time you have plans,
I want you to run 'em by me first. Okay?

06:43.946 --> 06:47.241
-No, I will not.
-Good! Why should you? I ain't your daddy.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.993
Okay, great.
We got ourselves a new member of the team.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.411
That's fine. I ain't got no--

06:51.495 --> 06:53.288
Why's it smell like
my nana's house in here?

06:54.498 --> 06:55.499
Oh, Ted.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.502
-Wait until you hear this shit.
-Do tell, Ricky Bell.

07:02.631 --> 07:03.632
No one wants you.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.095
What you mean no one wants me?
I'm Jamie fucking Tartt.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.556
You're too much of a liability.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.975
You act like an asshole
and disappear on Man City.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.978
Then you act like an asshole
and cheat on Amy with Denise

07:16.061 --> 07:17.187
by having Jacuzzi sex.

07:18.105 --> 07:19.731
No one wants you.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.109
What about a team in Spain or Germany?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.279
Hello, Real Madrid?
Do you want Jamie Tartt?

07:25.779 --> 07:28.448
No. Okay, thank you. See?

07:28.532 --> 07:30.033
You weren't even speaking Spanish.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.371
Maybe it's time for you to focus
on your television career.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.874
This is Tracey, your new talent agent.

07:36.957 --> 07:40.419
You have an amazing offer
for a new reality show in Ibiza.

07:40.502 --> 07:43.714
How do you feel about taking ecstasy
every night for three straight weeks?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.386
You gotta help me, man.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.264
Jamie, you know you're like a son to me.

07:53.098 --> 07:56.476
Now you're like a dead son,
which means I love you even more.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.272
There's nothing I can do.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
Ted Lasso Welcome Wagon has arrived.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.952
Please don't barge in here like that.
I could have been in a session.

08:14.036 --> 08:16.622
Oh, right. Of course, I'm sorry.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.499
-Can I help you with something?
-Well, yeah. No, I--

08:19.583 --> 08:22.252
I brought you a little somethin' somethin'
for your first day at work.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.254
-No, thank you.
-Come on, now.

08:24.338 --> 08:25.797
Just try a little bite, huh?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.511
There you go.

08:36.600 --> 08:39.937
That's very thoughtful, Coach Lasso.
But I don't eat sugar.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.106
Really? Wow. I've never met
someone who doesn't eat sugar.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.191
Only heard about 'em,

08:44.274 --> 08:46.818
and they all live in this godless place
called Santa Monica.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.321
Trust me,
it's in everyone's best interest.

08:49.404 --> 08:52.157
In a past life,
I would inhale a Cadbury's Flake,

08:52.241 --> 08:54.409
talk nonsense for an hour
until I passed out.

08:54.493 --> 08:56.787
-I'm the same way with video games.
-How so?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.581
You know, it's just
something in my life that I really enjoy.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.667
But then I pretend
that preventing myself from having 'em

09:01.750 --> 09:03.085
is somehow making my life better.

09:03.669 --> 09:05.087
But in reality,

09:05.170 --> 09:08.006
all I'm doing is depriving myself
of something that makes me happy,

09:08.090 --> 09:10.133
instead of attempting
to adjust my relationship to it.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.053
Hey, what's your favorite book?

09:15.806 --> 09:16.974
This is interesting.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.684
What is?
That my answer's The Fountainhead?

09:18.767 --> 09:20.519
I know, curveball, right? I can explain--

09:20.602 --> 09:21.728
No, what you're doing here.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.940
This is obviously your way
of connecting with new people.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.068
Makes sense. It's very disarming.

09:29.486 --> 09:33.448
If it's okay with you, Coach Lasso,
I'd like to observe training today.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.284
See how everything's functioning.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.786
Yeah, no, of course.

09:37.870 --> 09:40.080
Yeah, you got a backstage pass.
Full access.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.582
Thank you.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.210
Okay.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.131
Oh, hey, you know what I--

09:50.632 --> 09:53.302
And I will let you know
what the people from Dubai Air say.

09:53.886 --> 09:55.554
All right, you got any questions for me?

09:56.054 --> 10:00.267
Is it tacky to say I'm rich
on an online dating profile?

10:00.350 --> 10:02.394
Only if you put the word "filthy"
in front of it.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.234
Sorry, sorry.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.695
Higgins, it's very kind
that you gave your office to Sharon.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.074
Yes, it's very club-first mentality,
Leslie,

10:16.158 --> 10:18.744
but you really should have an office,
preferably your own.

10:18.827 --> 10:20.204
No, you're absolutely right.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.333
It's just very hard to kick an employee
out of their workplace home.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.959
It's only temporary.

10:26.043 --> 10:28.670
What about… Caroline in ad sales?

10:28.754 --> 10:30.714
No, she's going through a breakup.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.342
Plus, she's right next door
to Laughing Liam.

10:33.425 --> 10:34.676
Lovely man, but…

10:39.598 --> 10:42.226
Hey, Higgins. Who's your new friend here?

10:42.309 --> 10:44.811
Oh, hi, Robert. My name's Ted. Yep.

10:44.895 --> 10:47.231
Hey, my name's Jimmy.

10:47.898 --> 10:48.899
Jimmy Paper?

10:49.733 --> 10:53.237
Page! I goofed that.
I'm sorry, that was a great one. Dang it.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.613
Hey, boss.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.990
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

10:58.909 --> 10:59.910
What's this?

10:59.993 --> 11:01.995
I tried to give your biscuits
to Dr. Sharon.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.873
-You did what?
-Evidently she doesn't eat sugar.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.667
-What a fucking asshole.
-Yeah.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.335
You ever been to a therapist, Rebecca?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.712
What for?
I can diagnose myself in a heartbeat.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.673
I thought being invulnerable
would protect me,

11:12.756 --> 11:15.717
so I pushed people away for years,
leading me directly to my greatest fear:

11:15.801 --> 11:17.010
Being alone. Big whoop.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.637
Big whoop, yeah. I don't get it.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.139
Why pay someone to do
what a friend should do for you for free?

11:21.223 --> 11:23.892
Exactly. I mean,
that's why you have friends, isn't it?

11:23.976 --> 11:26.562
To burden them with your issues
and anxieties, right?

11:26.645 --> 11:27.855
Right. Yeah.

11:27.938 --> 11:30.566
Yeah. Speaking of, you got anything
you wanna get off your chest?

11:31.650 --> 11:33.819
No. You?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.364
No.

11:41.076 --> 11:43.120
-See, there you have it.
-Exactly. Yeah, okay.

11:43.954 --> 11:44.955
See you later, boss.

11:50.169 --> 11:52.087
-There you go, Keeley.
-Thanks, Alex.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.340
Jamie?

11:56.633 --> 11:57.968
I'm not stalking ya.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.720
I've been following you
for a few blocks now,

11:59.803 --> 12:01.847
and I couldn't text you
'cause I deleted your number.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.641
So, I was in town,
and I wanted to talk to you

12:04.725 --> 12:07.561
'cause I left Man City to do
this reality TV show thing,

12:07.644 --> 12:10.189
and I got kicked off of both.
So now I don't know what I'm doing,

12:10.272 --> 12:12.316
but I just wanted to talk to someone
about it 'cause--

12:12.399 --> 12:14.818
And whenever I think of talking,
I think of you…

12:15.569 --> 12:18.030
So I've been following you
for the last few blocks.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.531
No, I'm lying.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.658
I've been following you
for your whole lunch hour.

12:21.742 --> 12:24.578
But I've just been trying
to build up the courage to say hi.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.372
So… hi.

12:29.917 --> 12:30.918
Is that okay?

12:32.586 --> 12:34.004
You deleted my number?

12:35.005 --> 12:36.006
Yeah.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.510
You all played a hell of a game.

12:40.219 --> 12:41.470
But you lost.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.805
I want you to remember this feeling.

12:44.306 --> 12:48.393
Burn this moment into your brains.

12:51.230 --> 12:52.231
Good.

12:52.314 --> 12:53.815
Is it time for trophies, Uncle Roy?

12:53.899 --> 12:54.942
Yeah, yeah.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.569
Emily's mom bought everyone
consolation trophies.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.279
Must be nice to just burn cash.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.284
"Best dressed"? That's stupid.
You're all wearing the same thing.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.246
You.

13:08.664 --> 13:10.082
Right, you know what?

13:10.582 --> 13:13.502
Just get amongst it.
Enjoy your trophies for winning nothing.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.337
Coach Kent.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.257
Look, when I was young,
you got shouted at for losing.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.592
Same. But then,
tough love never bothered me.

13:20.676 --> 13:22.970
As long as I knew the coach gave a shit.

13:25.806 --> 13:29.476
Oy! It has been an honor
coaching all of you.

13:29.977 --> 13:32.312
I do hope you'll come back
and play next year.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.065
But only if you fucking mean it.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.448
Well, we lost.

13:45.284 --> 13:48.579
Would have been closer,
but one of the goals got disallowed

13:48.662 --> 13:53.000
because apparently nine-year-olds
aren't allowed to do headers yet.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.503
Fucking brain development.

14:04.928 --> 14:05.929
Keeley?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.994
-What you doing there?
-Nothing.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.372
Why'd you throw your phone?

14:32.456 --> 14:35.459
I thought that you were an intruder,
and I didn't want you to steal it.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.296
So you threw it over there?

14:40.005 --> 14:41.006
Yeah.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.091
Were you having a wank?

14:45.886 --> 14:46.887
Show me.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.473
No, that's okay.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.851
Babe, come on. Don't be embarrassed.
Whatever it is, it's fine.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.146
I like watching couples have sex
in the woods.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.606
You do? Why?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.525
'Cause I could never be that free.

14:59.608 --> 15:01.193
Come on, let me see.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.238
I should know what gets you going.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.995
I am announcing…

15:14.540 --> 15:16.124
my retirement…

15:17.125 --> 15:18.460
from--

15:20.671 --> 15:22.005
The fuck?

15:22.089 --> 15:23.423
This is your kink?

15:23.507 --> 15:24.675
Me being pathetic?

15:24.758 --> 15:29.012
You're not being pathetic.
You're being passionate and vulnerable.

15:30.055 --> 15:33.433
God, it's fucking hot, and you haven't
been like that since you left football.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.103
At my age with a fucked knee,
I don't get to be a football player.

15:36.186 --> 15:39.064
-That's how it works.
-Then why not just try the pundit gig?

15:39.147 --> 15:40.023
Oh, my God.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.818
I know it's fucking stupid.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.862
But you'd be back around the game again.

15:44.945 --> 15:47.072
You miss it, Roy. I know you do.

15:47.865 --> 15:49.449
You're just like Jamie.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.827
I didn't think this conversation
could get any worse.

15:52.327 --> 15:53.704
Jesus Christ.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.290
Yeah, I saw him today.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.251
He wants to come back
and play for Richmond.

16:00.294 --> 16:02.754
He's so lost, Roy. Just like you.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.631
But at least
he's tryin' to find his way back.

16:04.715 --> 16:06.049
See? Pathetic.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.634
No, it's not pathetic.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.052
It's brave.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.679
Oy, I get it.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.182
Can't get hurt if you don't try.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.266
But if you don't try,

16:14.349 --> 16:17.811
then I'm just gonna have to sit here
wanking to videos of you crying.

16:17.895 --> 16:22.274
Fine. I will try it once.

16:22.357 --> 16:24.818
But when it sucks and I hate it,

16:24.902 --> 16:27.946
I'm gonna hire a bunch of children
to follow you around and scream,

16:28.030 --> 16:30.365
"Told you so, told you so" for centuries.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.367
I look forward to the attention.

16:39.458 --> 16:41.210
What'd you tell
the prince prick of all pricks

16:41.293 --> 16:42.753
about going back to Richmond?

16:43.337 --> 16:45.506
I told him
he was talking to the wrong person.

17:00.229 --> 17:01.313
I named him Ted.

17:02.481 --> 17:03.732
After Ted Danson.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.443
All-time great.

17:06.527 --> 17:10.321
You know, from Cheers to Curb
to The Good Place. What a career.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.661
I mean, he's basically the male version
of Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

17:15.743 --> 17:17.871
Who's like the female version
of Dave Grohl.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.790
Yeah. All three of them
got that Midas touch, don't they?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.292
Nice to see ya, Jamie.

17:23.377 --> 17:24.502
Take a seat.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.006
How ya been?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.424
Awesome.

17:29.508 --> 17:30.551
-Yeah?
-The best.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.094
Pretty good.

17:32.177 --> 17:34.763
Okay, a little depressed. Yeah.

17:34.847 --> 17:36.014
It's all shit, Ted.

17:37.266 --> 17:39.142
That's a real roller coaster there.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.103
Glad I was tall enough
to join you on that ride.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.313
Anything I can help you with?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.233
So I was talking to Keeley,

17:46.316 --> 17:50.696
and I was just wondering, like,
what the chances were

17:50.779 --> 17:52.739
of me coming back
to play for you at Richmond?

17:53.699 --> 17:56.368
I don't know, Jamie,
you burned a lot of bridges over there.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.746
Look, Coach, I need Richmond.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.165
And Richmond needs you.

18:03.792 --> 18:04.835
-Thank you, Mae.
-Cheers.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.921
Actually, Mae, would you be a darling

18:08.005 --> 18:11.008
and ask those lads at the end of the bar
to stop staring at me, please?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.510
Oy, you three, fuck off.

18:13.594 --> 18:14.761
-Oh, yeah, course, Mae.
-Sorry!

18:14.845 --> 18:15.929
Fucking off now.

18:19.266 --> 18:21.143
Old people are so wise.

18:22.436 --> 18:23.854
They're like tall Yodas.

18:24.563 --> 18:25.564
Cheers.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.441
Cheers.

18:30.819 --> 18:34.448
Jamie, let me ask you something.
Why'd you do that reality show?

18:35.157 --> 18:37.159
You know,
you were getting good minutes up at City.

18:37.242 --> 18:41.413
I don't know, just thought it'd be fun.
Help boost me brand.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.170
Did it to piss off me dad.

18:49.463 --> 18:51.089
He was just on me after every match.

18:51.173 --> 18:55.719
How I played, how many minutes I played,
how I sat on the bench when I didn't play.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.346
Just drove me fucking mad.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.432
He can be a bit…

19:01.183 --> 19:02.184
Yeah.

19:02.935 --> 19:06.438
You know, I've noticed
that sometimes having a tough dad

19:06.522 --> 19:10.901
is exactly what drives certain fellas
to become great at what they do.

19:12.069 --> 19:14.947
You know, I hear Bono's father
was a real piece of work.

19:15.030 --> 19:18.200
But then again,
so was Joshua Tree, so you know…

19:19.535 --> 19:20.869
What about you?

19:20.953 --> 19:22.538
Was your old man like that?

19:22.621 --> 19:23.622
No.

19:24.540 --> 19:28.961
No, my father was a lot harder
on himself than he ever was on me.

19:31.839 --> 19:33.048
You're lucky.

19:36.218 --> 19:37.678
So what do you say then, Coach?

19:39.054 --> 19:41.056
Jamie, you're an amazing player.

19:43.976 --> 19:45.894
But I don't think it's a good idea.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.148
Yeah.

19:54.194 --> 19:57.865
Right, now get one where it looks like
they're sitting in my hand.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.041
That's some bullshit.

20:08.125 --> 20:09.877
-Bloody hell.
-Wait, that was last night?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.628
What are you all fussing over?

20:12.212 --> 20:14.381
Looks like Jamie's coming back
to Richmond.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.760
It looks like they're sitting on his hand.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.180
Get fucking stuck in!

20:21.263 --> 20:22.264
Just throw it here!

20:22.347 --> 20:24.057
Somebody order training extra spicy today?

20:24.141 --> 20:26.852
Yeah, it's got that Nando's
peri-peri sauce on it, huh?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.103
What the fuck was that?

20:28.979 --> 20:30.355
What the fuck you waiting for?

20:32.482 --> 20:35.652
How come every time I look back there
it's like she's getting closer and closer?

20:35.736 --> 20:37.779
-Thank you, Will.
-That's all right.

20:38.947 --> 20:41.575
Optical illusion induced by your mistrust
of her profession?

20:41.658 --> 20:42.993
Metaphor, huh?

20:43.076 --> 20:44.244
Bingo, Ringo.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.456
Is there-- Is there pineapple in this?

20:47.539 --> 20:48.832
Jesus Christ.

20:50.209 --> 20:53.003
I'm with Ted. We've been overrun
by incompetent outsiders.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.505
I don't think I said that, did I?

20:54.588 --> 20:56.548
-Not to me. It was him.
-Yeah.

20:59.301 --> 21:01.720
Come on now.
She's definitely getting closer.

21:03.138 --> 21:05.182
-Yes!
-Yeah, do it!

21:05.265 --> 21:06.600
Now, look at that. Hey, Nate.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.352
-Hit me two times, will ya?
-Yeah.

21:09.019 --> 21:10.729
Hey, Sam! Hold up! Hey!

21:10.812 --> 21:13.815
Look, baby, when you make that pass,
you gotta put some grass under it.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.025
Make Dani chase it down

21:15.108 --> 21:17.194
like it's a loose toddler
in a busy parking lot.

21:17.277 --> 21:19.446
You think you can do better?
Come here and do it then.

21:19.530 --> 21:21.281
Oy! Easy, bruv.

21:21.365 --> 21:23.075
No, no, no. That's okay. Sam's right.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.160
There ain't nothing going on
out here on this field

21:25.244 --> 21:26.787
that I can do better than any of y'all.

21:26.870 --> 21:29.790
Unless you break into a game of
"finish that Jimmy Buffett lyric."

21:29.873 --> 21:32.835
Then I'll be changing your latitudes
and attitudes left, right and center.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.670
You-- Hey, Sam.

21:34.753 --> 21:37.172
-I'm just tryin' to help the team here.
-Bullshit.

21:40.425 --> 21:41.635
Okay.

21:43.679 --> 21:46.014
I'm gonna see
what that's all about here real quick.

21:47.307 --> 21:49.309
He's not normally like this, you know, so…

21:49.977 --> 21:51.895
I guess Sam doesn't like Jimmy Buffett.

21:51.979 --> 21:53.105
Who's Jimmy Buffett?

21:53.814 --> 21:54.815
Really?

21:55.941 --> 21:59.319
Hey. Sam! Slow down. Hey, you got
something you wanna talk about?

21:59.403 --> 22:00.487
No.

22:00.571 --> 22:02.614
Really? It seems like you got
something on your mind.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.575
Something like,
"I'm angry about a mysterious thing

22:04.658 --> 22:05.909
so I'm gonna do some cussing now."

22:05.993 --> 22:07.578
I mean, I am angry.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.580
And I did cuss,
and every time I do, I regret it.

22:09.663 --> 22:10.747
'Cause people say cuss words

22:10.831 --> 22:13.333
when they don't know the right ones to use
to express themselves.

22:13.417 --> 22:14.543
Except Bernie Mac.

22:14.626 --> 22:17.588
He uses them like van Gogh uses yellow.
You know, effectively.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.132
-Come on, talk to me.
-I can't believe you're bringing Jamie

22:20.215 --> 22:21.133
-back to the team.
-What?

22:21.216 --> 22:22.885
I saw the picture of you and him
on Twitter.

22:22.968 --> 22:25.429
Oh, Sam,
there's a bunch of crazy stuff on Twitter.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.139
Heck, someone made an account
for my mustache.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.600
How many locker room punch-ups
have we had since Jamie's been gone?

22:29.683 --> 22:30.767
-None.
-None.

22:31.268 --> 22:34.021
Have we won yet? No, but we will.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.231
I believe that. Don't you?

22:37.441 --> 22:40.777
Just because Jamie can score goals
doesn't mean he deserves to be here.

22:47.618 --> 22:50.704
No teammate has ever made me feel
as bad about myself as Jamie did.

22:50.787 --> 22:53.540
-Sam, I understand your anger towards him.
-It's not him.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.626
I'm mad at you.

22:56.168 --> 22:57.711
You didn't even talk to us about it.

22:57.794 --> 23:00.339
Honestly, Sam, I didn't think
there was anything to talk about.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.840
I told Jamie it wasn't gonna happen.

23:04.843 --> 23:06.845
-Now I feel awkward.
-I bet.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.098
Did everybody see me when I stomped off--

23:10.182 --> 23:13.310
No, no one saw that. Yeah, man!
Everyone saw that. Come on.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.520
Of course they did.

23:17.022 --> 23:18.148
Coach, I'm so sorry.

23:18.232 --> 23:19.983
It's okay, Sam, all right?

23:20.067 --> 23:22.736
You are a leader on this team.
I want you to speak your mind.

23:23.737 --> 23:24.947
Thank you.

23:27.282 --> 23:30.410
You know, my father says
every time he sees you on TV,

23:30.494 --> 23:31.870
he's very happy that I am here.

23:33.288 --> 23:36.124
That I'm in safe hands with you.

23:37.459 --> 23:38.669
Well, that means a lot.

23:39.545 --> 23:40.546
I appreciate that.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.842
You know I still gotta make you
run a bunch of laps, right?

23:44.925 --> 23:46.593
-I was hoping you would.
-Okay. Get going.

23:46.677 --> 23:47.886
-Thank you.
-Yes.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.851
-Very well handled, Ted.
-Gee…

23:56.562 --> 23:57.729
Thank you, Higgins.

24:04.361 --> 24:05.362
What are you doing?

24:05.445 --> 24:08.490
Sorry.
What do you usually do with your lashes?

24:08.574 --> 24:10.534
I leave them the fuck alone.

24:11.618 --> 24:12.703
'Scuse me.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.581
-Hey.
-Hi.

24:15.664 --> 24:16.957
I wanted to see how it was going.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.793
Jamie Carragher sent me flowers.

24:19.877 --> 24:22.421
We fucking despised each other
when we played,

24:22.504 --> 24:23.922
now he's sending me flowers.

24:24.006 --> 24:26.300
How the fuck does he know
I love white orchids?

24:26.383 --> 24:28.510
Babe,
it's only natural to be a bit nervous.

24:28.594 --> 24:31.013
I'm not nervous.
There's nothing scary about this.

24:31.096 --> 24:32.764
There's no defense in TV.

24:33.599 --> 24:34.725
Well, what is it then?

24:34.808 --> 24:37.936
It's just-- What if--

24:41.190 --> 24:42.774
What if everyone thinks I'm shit?

24:43.483 --> 24:45.777
Since when do you care what people think?

24:45.861 --> 24:47.654
You're Roy fucking Kent.

24:49.448 --> 24:50.782
Ready for Mr. Kent.

24:51.283 --> 24:53.535
I gotta go. Thank you.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.205
Kill 'em. Roy-o!

25:19.102 --> 25:21.146
-Glad to have you on the show, Roy.
-Whatever.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.358
Same old Roy Kent.

25:25.234 --> 25:28.111
Hey, Roy, try not to get
too emotional, yeah?

25:28.195 --> 25:31.114
And we're on in five seconds.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.992
Four, three, two.

25:36.870 --> 25:40.249
What a match!
Manchester United beat Chelsea 1-nil

25:40.332 --> 25:42.876
in a result that drops Chelsea
out of the European places

25:42.960 --> 25:45.587
and lands United in the top three,
for now.

25:45.671 --> 25:46.713
Chris, was this a case

25:46.797 --> 25:49.132
where United won the match
or that Chelsea lost it?

25:49.216 --> 25:53.053
United just had that extra sharpness
in the final third,

25:53.136 --> 25:55.973
but I thought
both teams played really well.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.100
-George?
-A real even battle.

25:58.183 --> 26:00.102
You know, it's football at its finest.

26:00.185 --> 26:02.604
Roy Kent, ex-Chelsea legend joins us.

26:02.688 --> 26:04.106
Welcome, Roy.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.650
Right, what did you think?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.110
Did your former club play well?

26:08.193 --> 26:10.529
No. I thought they played like shit.

26:13.115 --> 26:14.825
Our apologies to the viewing audience.

26:14.908 --> 26:17.619
Roy Kent with some salty language.

26:17.703 --> 26:19.788
Would you care to elaborate, Roy?

26:19.872 --> 26:21.999
All right. Chelsea was shit today.

26:22.791 --> 26:23.834
They were shocking.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.336
Watching them, you'd never know
they were playing at home.

26:26.420 --> 26:29.590
They were too timid.
They were too respectful of United.

26:29.673 --> 26:32.551
They were lucky they didn't lose
by three or four or ten.

26:32.634 --> 26:36.096
That's harsh, Roy.
United's been on a good run recently.

26:36.180 --> 26:37.556
Who gives a shit, Chris?

26:38.849 --> 26:41.727
That's no excuse
to play like you're afraid of 'em.

26:41.810 --> 26:44.688
You could see it in their faces:
abject terror.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.983
Like children waiting in line
for the handsy Father Christmas.

26:48.066 --> 26:51.904
Have some fucking pride
in your shirt or don't fucking wear it.

26:52.988 --> 26:54.907
Roy Kent, you fucking legend!

26:54.990 --> 26:57.784
-I mean, that is how you do it!
-I enjoy his candor.

26:57.868 --> 27:02.206
Again, we apologize
for almost every word Roy just said.

27:11.757 --> 27:14.092
Higgins,
as a founding member of the Diamond Dogs,

27:14.176 --> 27:17.137
it breaks our little bowwow hearts
to see you wandering around this building.

27:17.221 --> 27:18.472
A man without a desk.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.308
So we'd like to ask you to move in with us
down here with my man, Nate.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.851
What do you say?

27:24.019 --> 27:27.189
That would be perfect.
I mean, only if it's okay with Nathan.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.192
Yeah, of course.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.693
Roomies!

27:32.736 --> 27:34.154
Oops, sorry.

27:34.238 --> 27:35.364
Now, before y'all bounce,

27:35.447 --> 27:37.866
I do have one piece of football business
we need to discuss.

27:37.950 --> 27:39.952
And that is Jamie Tartt's future
with this team.

27:40.035 --> 27:42.037
-I thought that was settled.
-Well, I did too.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.122
Then I was talking to Sam,
and he unsettled it.

27:44.790 --> 27:46.625
-Sam wants Jamie back?
-No, no.

27:46.708 --> 27:50.379
Sam just reminded me
that he himself has got a great dad.

27:50.462 --> 27:51.797
Not everyone has that.

27:52.422 --> 27:54.091
And isn't the idea of "never give up"

27:54.174 --> 27:56.093
one of them things
we always talk about in sports?

27:56.176 --> 27:57.678
And shouldn't that apply to people too?

27:57.761 --> 28:00.556
Two aces is very tempting.
Could be exactly what we need.

28:01.348 --> 28:04.226
But it could also ruin morale
to have someone in here

28:04.309 --> 28:06.144
just belittling everyone all the ti--

28:06.228 --> 28:09.523
Will! Will! Not beneath the lockers.
On the bench, man. Come on.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.024
Sorry.

28:12.901 --> 28:13.944
What a doughnut.

28:15.737 --> 28:16.738
What was I saying?

28:17.531 --> 28:20.450
-What about you, Coach?
-Pro: He's a great player.

28:20.534 --> 28:23.453
Con: He's a poop in the punch bowl.

28:24.037 --> 28:27.749
All right, Diamond Dogs, as canines,
we are supposed to lack opposable digits.

28:27.833 --> 28:30.002
But right now I'm gonna ask you:
thumbs up or thumbs down?

28:37.426 --> 28:40.220
Okay. Okay.

28:47.895 --> 28:48.896
Hi.

28:50.606 --> 28:51.815
How'd it go?

28:54.359 --> 28:56.028
Come on, babe. Say something.

28:56.111 --> 28:57.988
What, you just gonna pretend
like you hated it?

28:59.072 --> 29:00.282
You were amazing.

29:01.575 --> 29:04.536
-Shit, you really did hate it.
-May I have your phone?

29:06.455 --> 29:07.456
Roy, I'm really sorry.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.707
It's just that--

29:08.790 --> 29:11.835
I mean, not that it matters--
But everyone over there, they loved you.

29:11.919 --> 29:13.879
And Twitter was going cuckoo
for Coco Pops.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.758
But you don't ever have to do it again
if you don't want to, so…

29:18.342 --> 29:19.343
Here.

29:21.136 --> 29:22.930
Felt good to be back around the game.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.640
Oh, good.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.267
What are you doing?

29:27.809 --> 29:30.896
You helped me to help myself. Again.

29:31.897 --> 29:33.440
So I wanted to thank you properly.

29:34.775 --> 29:35.776
Hit play.

29:37.736 --> 29:39.238
I am announcing…

29:42.616 --> 29:43.951
my retirement…

29:45.202 --> 29:46.203
from--

30:03.971 --> 30:05.389
Hey, there she is.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.558
Good night, Coach Lasso.

30:07.641 --> 30:10.394
And thank you for letting me
observe training today.

30:11.228 --> 30:14.398
Some coaches get quite conspiratorial
at the notion.

30:14.982 --> 30:17.401
Well, I didn't know I had a choice.
I'm just goofing.

30:17.484 --> 30:20.153
Besides, most of my conspiracies
revolve around the Freemasons

30:20.237 --> 30:22.155
on account of a couple
different Disney cartoons

30:22.239 --> 30:23.490
I watched a bunch as a kid.

30:23.574 --> 30:26.368
I'll email you and your staff
my takeaways when I get home.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.287
Well, hey. Come on. Let 'er rip right now.

30:28.370 --> 30:29.580
Reading that email will be like

30:29.663 --> 30:31.331
listening to a cover tune
of your thoughts.

30:31.415 --> 30:34.168
Rather hear this tune for the first time
from the original artist.

30:34.251 --> 30:36.378
-Well, if you insist.
-I do.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.130
There's a wonderful atmosphere here.

30:39.173 --> 30:43.802
All the employees are thoughtful and kind,
and they actually listen to one another.

30:43.886 --> 30:45.554
Yeah, I've noticed the same thing.

30:46.555 --> 30:47.973
Well, hey, let me ask you this now.

30:48.056 --> 30:49.099
You think we got ourselves

30:49.183 --> 30:51.685
a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"
situation here or what?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.145
That depends.

30:53.228 --> 30:57.524
Does everyone agree that being winless
with eight straight draws "ain't broke"?

30:59.151 --> 31:00.152
Yeah.

31:01.195 --> 31:04.323
Heavy is the head that wears the visor,
Coach Lasso.

31:05.490 --> 31:07.367
You must have a lot on your mind.

31:08.577 --> 31:11.413
I hope we get a chance to sit down
and talk about it all someday.

31:11.496 --> 31:12.956
Yeah. No, I look forward to that.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.460
All right. Good night, Doc…tor! Doctor.

31:16.543 --> 31:17.544
Sorry.

31:18.128 --> 31:19.922
You can call me Doc. It's okay.

31:20.005 --> 31:22.549
Oh, thank God.
I mean, that's been killing me.

31:22.633 --> 31:24.718
You saw it, you know.
It's just such a good nickname.

31:24.801 --> 31:26.261
Prince of Tides.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.721
Is that your nickname for me now?

31:27.804 --> 31:30.766
No, Coach Lasso. My favorite book.

31:46.240 --> 31:48.408
The people at Dubai Air
have asked specifically for Sam.

31:48.492 --> 31:50.953
There's a photo shoot set up for Friday.

31:51.036 --> 31:54.248
Good for him.
That young man deserves some recognition.

31:54.331 --> 31:55.332
Yeah.

31:57.084 --> 32:00.462
Hello. Sorry to interrupt.
I'm Sharon Fieldstone.

32:00.546 --> 32:03.590
Yes. Oh, it is lovely to meet you,
Dr. Fieldstone.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.844
-Please, call me Sharon. Hi.
-Hi! Lovely to meet you.

32:06.927 --> 32:08.387
I just wanted to stop by

32:08.470 --> 32:10.848
and thank you for the lovely gift basket
of bottled water.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.433
Yes, well, Ted said you didn't eat sugar.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.310
So many other things
don't have sugar in them.

32:16.311 --> 32:19.022
I really am glad that you're joining us.

32:19.106 --> 32:22.568
I hope that you'll be just the boost
we need to get things going around here.

32:22.651 --> 32:23.986
Wouldn't you say, Higgins?

32:26.196 --> 32:27.197
Leslie?

32:27.823 --> 32:29.366
Sorry, I was just…
