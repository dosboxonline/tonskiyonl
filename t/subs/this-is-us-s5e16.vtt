Philip, hi!

00:05.672 --> 00:08.550
Kate, there were a lot
of applicants for this job.

Hi, this is Toby Damon calling.

00:18.226 --> 00:19.519

I'm home with triplets, Jack.
There are three of them.

02:30.859 --> 02:33.194
Okay? Three of them.
I had to wait an entire week

02:33.278 --> 02:34.529
to watch an episode of television

02:34.612 --> 02:36.573
that the entire country is talking about.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.868
One week of covering my ears
and humming every time

02:39.951 --> 02:42.120
I entered the grocery store

02:42.203 --> 02:44.039
that I might accidentally learn

who died at the wedding and ruin

-What?

02:52.213 --> 02:54.841
Hi, guys. Hi.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.846
Mommy and Daddy were having
a really silly conversation

02:59.929 --> 03:01.473
-about television... Aah!
-Yeah, silly.

03:01.556 --> 03:03.808

There's no other way to say this.

03:25.455 --> 03:28.667

03:28.750 --> 03:32.754
So... Mummy is leaving, darling.

03:32.837 --> 03:35.757
I've really tried, but...

03:38.426 --> 03:40.345
Here.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.598
Maybe you'll wear them on your
wedding day and think of me.

I'm so glad we chose Frankie Valli

04:02.075 --> 04:03.326
for the pre-ceremony music, although,

04:03.410 --> 04:05.328
I was thinking of the song order,
and I'm not sure

04:05.412 --> 04:07.163
we got it right and...
Oh, my God!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.332

Hey.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.424
Hi. Yeah.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.175
Yeah, you are. You were...
-Yeah.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.136
...reciting the dinner menu
in your sleep last night.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.763
-Again? Oh, God, just...
-Mm-hmm.

04:23.847 --> 04:25.515
I'm sorry, I want everything
to be perfect, you know?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.350
-Uh-huh.
-NICKY: Wait, wait!

04:27.434 --> 04:29.728
Go back.
Uh... just... say that again.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.605
-Uh...
-Yeah, I'm-I'm documenting
everything for today.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.940
You don't have to do that.
We actually hired

04:34.024 --> 04:35.525
a videographer, so you can just,

04:35.608 --> 04:37.235
you know, attend the ceremony.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.904
Come on, go back, be cute.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.073
Uh, all right, Pearson.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.616
This is it.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.870
For the last time, women
in my family get varicose veins

04:46.953 --> 04:49.039
early-- knees and ankles.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.750
We look like Thomas Guides
by the time we're 50.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.127
So this is your last chance
to make a run for it.

04:54.210 --> 04:56.546
No, my feet are firmly planted

04:56.629 --> 04:58.089
-right here on the ground.
-Okay.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.092
Please, um, practice your vows.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.386
-Mm.
-No movie quotes.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.430
Improv Kevin was not invited

05:05.513 --> 05:07.223
-to the ceremony.
-No, I'll-I'll let him know.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.975
He's gonna be absolutely devastated,

05:09.059 --> 05:10.852
but I'll break the news.
Just think, in a couple of hours

05:10.935 --> 05:12.771
you and I will be under an altar--

05:12.854 --> 05:14.189
an altar that you designed

05:14.272 --> 05:15.732
because you're an absolute boss.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.525
MADISON:
Hmm, I like it when you call me a boss.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.277
It portends well for our future.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.196
-Well, now you got me nervous.
-(Nicky laughs)

05:21.279 --> 05:23.114
It's perfect, perfect!

05:23.198 --> 05:25.325
It's great.
Cut.

05:25.408 --> 05:26.785
So, listen,

05:26.868 --> 05:28.703
will you be able
to get a U-Haul there this afternoon?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.372
My gift is being delivered

05:30.455 --> 05:32.248
to the wedding site and, uh,

05:32.332 --> 05:34.918
you're never gonna be able
to drive it home in a normal car.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.045
Uh, Uncle Nicky, I'm gonna need you

05:37.128 --> 05:39.297
to go ahead and interact with me
as little as humanly possible

05:39.381 --> 05:41.466
-today, okay? Thanks.
-You got it.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.929
Okay, Jack and Hailey are both
down for their nap.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.515
We can finish packing and then
we can transfer them to the car.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.183
And then they're gonna sleep
all the way to the hotel.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.185
Yeah, this is never
gonna work, but as ever,

05:52.268 --> 05:54.187
I appreciate your optimism.

05:54.270 --> 05:55.271
They're gonna stay down.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.399
-Want to bet?
-Ooh!

05:57.482 --> 06:00.485
Yeah, what ya putting on the table?

06:00.568 --> 06:03.488
Okay, I win,
you do that head thing I love.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.240
-The scalp tickle?
-Mm-hmm.

06:05.323 --> 06:07.283
For, like, 20 minutes.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.120
High stakes.
Fine.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.122
Oh, this is great--
I didn't have a head tickle

06:12.205 --> 06:14.082
-on my Toby bingo card today.
-(Kate laughs)

06:14.165 --> 06:16.501
-You know what else
I didn't have on my card?
-What?

06:16.584 --> 06:18.795
-Getting a job.
-(zips bag)

06:18.878 --> 06:21.006
What?

06:21.089 --> 06:22.298
Yeah, they just sent
the official offer letter though.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.758
The start-up?

06:23.842 --> 06:25.260
-Mm-hmm.
-Babe!

06:30.056 --> 06:31.599
-That's right.
-That's right.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.269
They are gonna want me
in San Francisco three days a week

06:34.352 --> 06:37.564
when the office re-opens, so...

06:39.774 --> 06:41.568
Oh.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.737
Okay...

06:43.820 --> 06:45.739
-Well, so...
-I think we should

06:45.822 --> 06:47.407
seriously consider it.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.117
We're not gonna be able
to survive much longer

06:49.200 --> 06:51.536
on your teaching assistant salary alone.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.164
And I haven't gotten
a serious offer in a long time.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.874
Okay, well, we're getting by.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.585
I mean, we're not saving,
but we're not drowning.

06:58.668 --> 07:01.004
I want to go back to work, Kate.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.466
I need to.... emotionally,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.134
mentally.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.511
Staying at home is just...

07:08.595 --> 07:11.598
All right, I love our children, but...

07:12.932 --> 07:14.851
Okay, got it.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.978
Kate?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.398
Toby.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.650
My husband is contemplating taking a job

07:22.734 --> 07:25.362
that will put him in a different
city three days a week.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.280
And he just used the sentence

07:27.364 --> 07:29.949
"I love our children, but."

07:30.033 --> 07:33.203
Just give me a second to digest it.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.134
Mm.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.764
What are you guys doing up?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.892

08:01.147 --> 08:03.024

-What?

08:03.108 --> 08:05.860
They're just standing there.

08:05.944 --> 08:08.780
-Oh.
-Like <i>Children of the Corn</i> or something.

08:08.863 --> 08:11.116

08:12.200 --> 08:14.828

Okay, let's head

08:22.293 --> 08:24.963

can get ready together.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.756
All right, we'll see you there, but first,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.633
oh, I can't stop hugging you.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.927
Oh, God, it's happening to me, too.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.887
Must... hug...

08:32.971 --> 08:34.305
grandchildren.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.724
Guys, stop!

08:35.807 --> 08:37.559
REBECCA:
Uh, we're not gonna stop.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.352
I-I feel like I'm owed
a year's worth of hugs.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.022
-MIGUEL: Yeah.
-Hey, Dej, let's hurry it up over there.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.149
Oh!
Hey, Malik.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.525
<i>-Hey.</i>
-Any news from Penn?

08:45.608 --> 08:47.485
<i>(chuckles)</i>
<i>Uh, no, not yet.</i>

08:47.569 --> 08:49.195
Uh, you know, Malik applied

08:49.279 --> 08:51.740
to the four top schools
in the Philly area.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.534
-And he got into three,
because he's a beast.
-Wow.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.912
Hey, you know who else is a great student?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.414
Alex.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.708
Yeah, Tess is dating her class

09:01.791 --> 09:03.710
valedictorian-- isn't that right, babe?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.462
Uh, they're a very good student.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.838
Yeah.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.132
Batgirls... let's, uh,

09:09.215 --> 09:11.259
get your stuff together
to the Batmobile, come on.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.386
Must hug more...

09:13.470 --> 09:15.472
grandchildren.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.099
Must... hug.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.893
Is that creepy or charming?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.353
Yeah, I can't tell yet.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.771
Okay.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.814
-Here we go.
-I can't believe you guys

09:24.898 --> 09:26.274
are already leaving tomorrow.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.568
I feel like we... haven't
had a chance to catch up.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.237
I know, I know.
Wedding weekends always fly by so fast.

09:31.321 --> 09:32.864
Yeah.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.991
I was hoping to hear

09:35.075 --> 09:37.660
-more about your trip to New Orleans.
-What?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.954
-I told you about it.
-No, you didn't.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.749
Not-not much anyway.
Randall, we haven't

09:42.832 --> 09:45.001
seen each other in ages and...

09:45.085 --> 09:47.295
I just want to know how it was for you.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.339
Okay.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.633
Well, I-I'd really like
to tell you about it.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.344
-Okay.
-(laughing): Okay.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.013
Okay, everyone, let's go!

09:57.097 --> 09:59.057
Let's get Kevin married!

09:59.140 --> 10:02.727
Need more hugs.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.397
Yeah, uh, it's-it's way creepy now.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.277
Holy crap!

10:11.361 --> 10:13.363
You rented out this whole thing?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.365
Yeah, well, you know,
it's easier that way with COVID.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.075
Geez, how rich are you?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.785
(laughs)
Uh, okay.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.161
I've got to go over
the pre-ceremony music,

10:20.245 --> 10:21.788
I've got to double-check the playlist,

10:21.871 --> 10:23.415
and I then I want to head out
to the garden just to make sure

10:23.498 --> 10:25.417
everything is perfect out there.
Here's comes everybody. Hey!

10:25.500 --> 10:27.377
-Hey!
-What's up?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.337
Look at this place!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.423
-Not bad, right?
-Not bad at all, brother.

10:31.506 --> 10:34.551
-What's going on?
-Oh, you know, nothing.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.636
-How are you? You guys look beautiful.
-Good.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.638
-How are you doing?
-RANDALL: All right, Coach,
come on, put me in the game.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.057
-What do you need.
-No, nothing, nothing so far.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.809
-Everything is good, smooth.
-Yeah?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.394
-Yeah
-'Cause a week ago you were
Jerry Maguire-ing out.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.813
-But, uh, you're good?
-Yeah.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.440
No, I know my entire life has
been an exercise

10:48.523 --> 10:50.150
in romantic self-destruction,

10:50.233 --> 10:52.068
but not today.
Today I am good.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.361
This is exactly where I want to be.

10:53.445 --> 10:54.696
I just want to make sure
everything's perfect.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.114
-You know what I mean?
-Okay.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.866
Well, I'm here for you, brother.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.242
God knows I wouldn't mind

10:59.325 --> 11:00.910
being pulled away right now.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.246
Well, what does that mean?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.248
Uh, nothing.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.834
Mom wants to talk about
my trip to New Orleans.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.003
Aha.
Well...

11:10.086 --> 11:13.256
Yeah. Hey, you keep your eye
on the ball, okay?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.466
Text me if you need me.

11:14.549 --> 11:16.468
Yo, Batgirls.
To the Batcave.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.803
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.222
-I have dresses for the bridesmaids.
-Cool.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.474
(gasps)
How pretty.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.978
Oh, that's nice.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.567
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

11:32.650 --> 11:35.862
All right, come on.
See you later, man.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.822
All right.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.449
What?

11:39.532 --> 11:41.743
We have a small problem.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.415
So, the altar collapsed an hour ago.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.501
The crossbeam is completely shattered.

11:49.584 --> 11:50.877
But we have a plan.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.545
We are going to rearrange the furniture,

11:52.629 --> 11:53.672
And instead of the altar,

11:53.755 --> 11:55.131
you can get married
under the statement tree.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.300
-Now, we discussed that option earlier.
-We did.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.636
And then we came back to the altar.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.055
Remember, Madison
designed the whole thing?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.057
Traditional rustic, her favorite flowers?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.266
I know.
And I'll talk to her.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.102
Okay?
The only thing you need to do is relax.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.603
KEVIN:
Vanessa, listen.

12:08.687 --> 12:11.106
Madison and I haven't exactly had

12:11.189 --> 12:13.483
the most romantic beginning
to this marriage,

12:13.566 --> 12:15.318
but so help me, today...

12:15.402 --> 12:16.695
today will be one for the ages.

12:16.778 --> 12:19.864
So I will relax when everything's

12:19.948 --> 12:22.742
exactly the way she wanted it,
not a moment sooner.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.619
Do you... do you have to do that
right now, though?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.079
Yeah. I mean, you're gonna want this.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.206
That speech was great.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.166
VANESSA:
Absolutely.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.544
Women getting all gussied up.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.296
Randy P. feeling fine.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.674
What's he gonna do with his free time?

12:37.757 --> 12:40.927
-Cooking up a batch of...
-Randall.

12:41.011 --> 12:44.180
Um, the hair and makeup people
don't come for an hour.

12:44.264 --> 12:48.393
Maybe now is a good time
to grab a coffee and catch up?

12:48.476 --> 12:50.687
Yes, ma'am.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.189
Guess Randy P. is doing that.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.278
Yes.
So, um, this is Hai.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.613
He's the one who contacted me.

13:00.697 --> 13:04.993
And this here... that's, uh, Laurel.

13:05.076 --> 13:08.329
That's my birth mother.

13:08.413 --> 13:09.664
Wow.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.167
Stunning.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.381
Uh, yeah, I...

13:18.465 --> 13:19.883
You have her eyes.

13:19.966 --> 13:22.010
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

13:22.093 --> 13:25.555
I thought so, too, but I wasn't sure.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.807
Everyone always says Annie and I
have the same eyes,

13:27.891 --> 13:31.728
so I guess that, um...
I guess that tracks.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.650
Oh, man, have I told you
what Annie's gotten into?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.444
-No.
-Bowling.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.237
She's a strangely good bowler.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.740
The other day she bowled a 214.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.119
I literally had to goggle
"bowling scholarships."

13:48.203 --> 13:50.497
-Anyhow...
-Anyhow.

13:50.580 --> 13:51.706
-Randall.
-Yeah?

13:51.790 --> 13:53.375
Best man emergency.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.211
-Duty calls.
-Go, go, go.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.046
I need you to rally the troops, all right?

13:58.129 --> 14:00.507
Find the biggest SUV you can find
and head to Home Depot.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.342
Okay, um...

14:02.425 --> 14:03.843
what are we?

14:03.927 --> 14:05.428
KEVIN:
The altar, the whole thing, it's just...

14:12.644 --> 14:15.230
Okay, guys, uh,
we know you heard us

14:15.313 --> 14:19.109
having a, uh...
conversation in loud voices.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.319
-Because Daddy messed up.
-(Jack chuckles)

14:21.403 --> 14:25.490
-But, uh, we want to show you something.
-Yeah.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.829
REBECCA: This is Mommy and Daddy
on their wedding day.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.331
And that is Daddy telling Mommy

14:33.415 --> 14:34.457
how much he loves her.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.210
♪ ♪

14:37.293 --> 14:39.587
He was very charming
that day, your father.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.381
(Jack and Rebecca chuckle)

14:41.464 --> 14:43.508
Go ahead and tell them
what you were saying, babe.

14:43.591 --> 14:48.346
Oh, see, this was the start
of my vows, and...

14:48.430 --> 14:50.640
And, you know, I was...

14:50.724 --> 14:52.851
-I was-I was saying...
-Wait. You...

14:52.934 --> 14:55.603
You seriously don't remember
your wedding vows?

14:55.687 --> 14:58.648
Oh, come on, do you remember yours?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.275
Yes, I do, in fact, because it was

15:00.358 --> 15:02.444
one of the most important days
of my life, Jack.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.446
But it's okay, because
you will probably just

15:04.529 --> 15:06.156
tape over this with some ball game.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.866
Come on, are you still
mad about that stupid show?

15:07.949 --> 15:09.993
-Stupid show?
-Yeah, stupid show.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.246
-They had a terrorist
massacre at a wedding?
-Yeah.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.789
That ain't high art, Bec.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.917
Plus, my secretary said
they only killed Luke and Lady Ash,

15:18.001 --> 15:19.127
-not even any of the main characters.
-Lady Ashley?!

15:19.210 --> 15:21.212
Did you seriously
just ruin the show for me?

15:21.296 --> 15:23.048
-The show ruined itself a long time ago.
-Oh...

15:23.131 --> 15:24.632
Joan can do better.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.343
-Babe...
-Huh?

15:26.426 --> 15:29.095
-Hey, hey!
-(Rebecca forces a laugh)

15:29.179 --> 15:32.057
Guys, we are genuinely, madly in love.

15:32.140 --> 15:35.810
-Oh, married couples hate us.
-Hate us.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.312
It's why we have no friends.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.606
JACK:
Yeah, none.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.400
You guys need to get married again.

-A dress.

For the eighth grade dance.

15:57.457 --> 16:01.044

to make this kind of commitment,

18:07.504 --> 18:08.922

18:09.005 --> 18:11.007
and I should tiptoe right now,

You could murder somebody.

18:41.746 --> 18:43.540
I'd be surprised.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.166
I'd probably ask a couple questions,

18:45.250 --> 18:46.835

I got divorced and then I almost
missed the birth of my children.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.107
-Mm.
-Wait, why do you ask?

23:19.190 --> 23:20.942
No reason.
I mean, no reason

31:20.588 --> 31:23.383
as far as it's gonna go, Madison.

31:23.466 --> 31:25.051
Okay, no, no, no, David.

31:25.135 --> 31:26.428
Come on, we're-we're just going
through a little rough patch...

31:26.511 --> 31:29.472
I-I don't feel about you
the way you feel about me.

31:30.807 --> 31:32.142
Okay.
Hang on, um...

31:32.225 --> 31:34.185
Madison...

31:34.269 --> 31:36.021
and I say this as a friend.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.941
I don't know why there'd be
anything more to say

31:40.025 --> 31:41.651
after what I just said.

31:45.947 --> 31:47.741
Um...

31:48.742 --> 31:50.744
(sniffles)

32:11.806 --> 32:15.352
Look, I know I don't have
the same issues as everyone here,

32:15.435 --> 32:16.936
I recognize that.

32:17.020 --> 32:20.148
But you guys don't know
what it's like looking like me

32:20.231 --> 32:23.651
and carrying around that extra
seven pounds in your midsection.

32:31.576 --> 32:34.496
VANESSA:
Madison?

32:34.579 --> 32:36.581
Excuse me.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.176
Oh, God, I do need to put my face on.

32:48.259 --> 32:50.220
(knocking on door)

32:50.303 --> 32:52.055
(sighs)

32:55.392 --> 32:56.976
Hey.

33:02.607 --> 33:04.359
(quietly): Hi.

33:04.442 --> 33:06.444
Am I supposed to be seeing you?

33:06.528 --> 33:07.904
I don't think I'm supposed
to be seeing you.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.115
You-you look incredible, but I don't think

33:10.198 --> 33:13.785
-I'm supposed to be seeing you.
-I know. I'm sorry. Um...

33:13.868 --> 33:16.246
-You're not dressed, by the way.
-No, I know. It's a long story.

33:16.329 --> 33:17.956
I'll tell you later.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.503
(laughs softly)

33:26.464 --> 33:28.633
Are you in love with me?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.056
Madison, uh...
(chuckles)

33:35.140 --> 33:37.600
We're getting married in, like, two hours.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.103
We're-we're gonna become a family.

33:40.186 --> 33:41.730
A family.

33:41.813 --> 33:46.359
Yeah, we, um, we use that language a lot.

33:46.443 --> 33:50.196
"We have fallen in love with this family."

33:50.280 --> 33:52.240
"The four of us are
the only thing that matters."

33:55.160 --> 33:57.078
I'm not sure what-what you're...

33:57.162 --> 34:00.832
I have fallen in love with you, Kevin.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.668
It's no surprise.

34:03.752 --> 34:07.047
You are very easy to fall in love with.

34:09.966 --> 34:13.136
But, um...

34:13.219 --> 34:16.014
Sorry. I, uh, I know
this timing is terrible

34:16.097 --> 34:20.852
and, um, borderline cliché, but, uh...

34:20.935 --> 34:22.937
(exhales)

34:27.609 --> 34:29.277
My mother gave me these.

34:31.279 --> 34:32.655
And then she left.

34:34.282 --> 34:37.285
She left me with a father
who gave me nothing.

34:38.536 --> 34:40.080
Who literally told me

34:40.163 --> 34:43.083
not to expect life to have magical sparks.

34:47.253 --> 34:51.132
I have stumbled through a life
gratefully accepting

34:51.216 --> 34:54.803
whatever scraps of affection
anyone would give me.

34:56.805 --> 35:00.850
And you are so wonderful.

35:02.894 --> 35:05.105
(sighs)

35:05.188 --> 35:07.732
Your...

35:07.816 --> 35:12.487
Your family has given me
the first family I have ever had.

35:14.906 --> 35:18.118
And it would be so easy for me
to tiptoe around the fact

35:18.201 --> 35:21.121
that you may not be in love with me.

35:26.251 --> 35:27.877
Hey.

35:30.755 --> 35:33.842
I think we can take a breath here, okay?

35:35.260 --> 35:37.971
Okay.

35:38.054 --> 35:40.765
I love what we have.

35:40.849 --> 35:43.643
I love what we're building.

35:43.727 --> 35:47.230
I-I think you are incredible.

35:47.313 --> 35:49.065
(laughs softly)

35:49.149 --> 35:53.653
And I love watching you
with our children, and-and...

35:55.655 --> 35:59.409
The time I spend with you,
I-I feel good and full

35:59.492 --> 36:02.454
-and-and happy and...
-Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, come on.

36:04.456 --> 36:07.667
You have been running around all week

36:07.751 --> 36:09.461
trying to make today perfect.

36:11.463 --> 36:13.965
-Don't you see...
-We didn't come together
under normal circumstances.

36:14.049 --> 36:17.594
I know that.
I know that you know that.

36:17.677 --> 36:20.305
But what we...
This-this, what we have...

36:23.558 --> 36:24.684
...it will grow.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.979
It can grow.
It will.

36:29.773 --> 36:31.608
Okay?

36:35.320 --> 36:38.740
I can't marry someone
who's not in love with me.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.746
I know it's ironic, but I think you have

36:44.829 --> 36:47.832
finally helped me realize
that I am worthy of that.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.671
Are you nerv... are...
Maybe this is you

36:52.754 --> 36:54.714
-and you're nervous,
you're getting the jitters.
-No, no, no.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.841
-No, this is a normal thing.
This is what people go through.
-No. Kevin.

36:56.925 --> 36:58.927
-I am begging you right...
Don't do this, okay?
-We can still do this

36:59.010 --> 37:00.845
-I want to be with you, Madison.
-all together. We can raise
a family together.

37:00.929 --> 37:02.555
-I want to be with you and our children.
-I will commit to that with you,

37:02.639 --> 37:04.349
-okay? But we...
-The children that we created together

37:04.432 --> 37:05.642
-in-in a house together,
-We cannot get married this way, Kevin.

37:05.725 --> 37:07.936
-as a family.
-That cannot be us.

37:10.855 --> 37:12.857
You know it.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.613
-Please don't do this.
-Kevin, you know it.

37:34.838 --> 37:36.047
(grunts softly)

37:38.091 --> 37:40.468
So, how was your day?

37:40.552 --> 37:44.472
Oh, you know.

37:47.475 --> 37:50.478
Couldn't say it to her.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.647
Not like that.

37:53.648 --> 37:56.860
I couldn't lie to her.

37:56.943 --> 37:59.904
-KATE: Hey.
-How is she?

37:59.988 --> 38:02.407
Yeah, she's with the babies.
Hanging in.

38:02.490 --> 38:04.868
She's worried about you.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.369
How you doing, brother?

38:07.495 --> 38:08.913
Yeah...

38:08.997 --> 38:11.583
I'm numb, I think.

38:16.755 --> 38:19.174
I wonder what he would do right now.

38:22.844 --> 38:25.555
It's getting harder for me, lately,

38:25.638 --> 38:30.560
to add your father
to our family situations.

38:30.643 --> 38:33.897
It used to come so easily,

38:33.980 --> 38:36.066
but so much has changed.

38:36.149 --> 38:39.069
Uh, grandchildren and marriages and...

38:41.196 --> 38:44.199
And I don't know if it's this disease,

38:44.282 --> 38:47.786
but it's, it's like my brain
won't allow me

38:47.869 --> 38:50.372
to actually add him

38:50.455 --> 38:54.334
to scenes sometimes, you know?

38:54.417 --> 38:56.294
Hmm.

38:57.962 --> 39:01.383
He wouldn't leave Kevin's side tonight.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.718
Yeah.
That is for sure.

39:03.802 --> 39:06.346
And he'd be worried that you would drink.

39:11.017 --> 39:12.185
I won't.

39:13.812 --> 39:16.356
You need to stay busy,
'cause you're... you're best

39:16.439 --> 39:18.066
-when you're busy.
-Yes. I will.

39:18.149 --> 39:19.776
Hmm.

39:23.947 --> 39:27.325
I actually have a project for you.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.786
I don't know how many good years
I have left.

39:29.869 --> 39:32.539
I just know that I want to spend
as much time with you guys

39:32.622 --> 39:34.958
as possible.

39:35.041 --> 39:37.127
And I found, um,

39:37.210 --> 39:39.963
a different kind of peace
at the cabin this year.

39:41.798 --> 39:42.966
Kev.

39:44.426 --> 39:47.595
Build me that house.

39:47.679 --> 39:49.681

-What?
-No, I told you 12 times this morning,

41:56.891 --> 41:58.101
-no boys allowed in here.
-Boys? I'm a 45-year-old grown man,

41:58.184 --> 41:59.728
thank you kindly.
I have a question.

41:59.811 --> 42:01.980
-Hey, you got something
on your tie. Get out.
-No. Oh!

42:02.063 --> 42:03.732
