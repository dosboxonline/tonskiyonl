00:45.359 --> 00:47.396
Good morning.

00:49.159 --> 00:51.196
Good morning.

00:51.399 --> 00:55.996
- I am a reporter from "The Farmer's
Magazine". - Good.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.193
Why don't you  write we needs funds
from the Province!

01:00.399 --> 01:04.393
The crop is wasted!
4 months with no rain!

01:04.599 --> 01:09.594
I am here for another reason. 
I'd like to get info, gossips ...

01:09.799 --> 01:14.271
... about a famous farmer in this area
- Who is he?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.756
Elia Codogno.

01:22.599 --> 01:26.195
Elia! What did he do?
- Nothing.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.791
Today it's his 40th birthday.
What kind of person is he?

01:31.000 --> 01:36.154
Bad mood. A bear,
despotic and bossy.

01:40.879 --> 01:46.193
- He has no friends.

01:46.400 --> 01:50.473
- Is he really unmanageable?
He can even fight with the barber!

01:50.680 --> 01:55.390
After he cut his hair
he put the mirror behind his head
and he said they were too short.

02:08.240 --> 02:12.233
When my daughters had a party
and played some music.

02:12.439 --> 02:16.149
- He sued me for making noise.
You live 2 km away from him!

02:16.360 --> 02:19.352
He said I woke up his chickens!

02:27.840 --> 02:31.992
Elia sued everybody in this town.

02:32.199 --> 02:35.397
Even me. - Who are you?
I am the judge.

02:43.240 --> 02:48.268
- Is Elia married? - Don't mention women,
or he'll smash your head.

02:48.479 --> 02:52.473
He doesn't want to see anybody.
- Does he live alone? - He has a servant...

03:04.400 --> 03:07.995
On Sunday she invited a woman at home.

03:08.199 --> 03:12.239
He dressed up like Frankenstein.

03:12.439 --> 03:16.479
The poor girl was so scared
she ran away.

03:21.400 --> 03:25.473
Is he coming here today?
- He already did. He's playing tennis now.

03:25.680 --> 03:30.629
Do still people want to play with him?

03:44.479 --> 03:47.472
Out! Your match!

03:50.080 --> 03:52.878
I'll kill you!

03:59.800 --> 04:01.836
Surrender!

04:07.520 --> 04:09.636
I won!

04:12.080 --> 04:15.755
- There he is!
You smoke too much. Enough!

04:17.560 --> 04:22.350
One coffee. - How do you want it?
- Long and ristretto. - Fine.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.196
- This is my stool. Get off!
- Excuse me, I didn't know that.

04:34.399 --> 04:39.872
My name is ... - Stop! 
I've already met too many people this month.

04:40.079 --> 04:44.073
- I work for "The Farmer's Magazine".
- I don't.

04:44.279 --> 04:47.477
- Sugar?
- Two uneven sugar cubes.

04:47.680 --> 04:52.151
Our magazine would like to honor you
with an article on first page.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.911
Do I need to pay? - No.
What do you want to know?

04:57.120 --> 05:01.671
While I was waiting,
your friends told me about you.

05:01.879 --> 05:05.953
What did they say? - They didn't say
very nice things.

05:06.160 --> 05:10.870
You are a famous and funny person.
But you have a very bad behavior.

05:11.079 --> 05:16.950
What? I bad behavior?
(altogether) Yes, you do!

05:18.319 --> 05:20.311
Really?

05:22.079 --> 05:26.790
You say this because you are in a group,
but one by one ...

05:27.000 --> 05:30.834
- Do I have a bad behavior?
Yes. - You are a brave man.

05:31.040 --> 05:35.113
People say he's grumpy
because he's not married.

05:35.319 --> 05:39.108
Am I grumpy because not married ...?

05:39.319 --> 05:42.835
I understand!

05:43.040 --> 05:47.033
You, married man,
you dare to say that?

05:47.240 --> 05:52.030
The marriage ruined your life!
Women have changed you.

05:54.040 --> 05:58.556
Nothing to say about you. I pity you.
You had a forest on your head!

05:58.759 --> 06:02.548
You were slim!
Move away, Easter egg.

06:07.040 --> 06:10.919
- You were a champion of arm wrestling.
- Right, so what?

06:11.120 --> 06:14.112
So, show me how strong you are,
married man!

06:21.680 --> 06:26.629
You were 2.40 m, tall
and you could spot a bird one miles away.

06:26.839 --> 06:30.071
And now you can't even spot your own!

06:30.279 --> 06:34.751
You pity me? I feel fine, and strong.

06:34.959 --> 06:38.475
Can any of you do this at 40 years old of age?

06:38.680 --> 06:41.672
Well done!
He's good!

06:43.839 --> 06:46.479
With no hands.

06:54.560 --> 06:57.711
- Good morning, Elia.
- Good morning.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.636
Whistling

07:14.120 --> 07:16.759
Move on! Jump!

07:16.959 --> 07:19.713
Higher! Come on!

07:19.920 --> 07:24.835
Father Cirillo! - Hi. I'm training my guys.

07:25.040 --> 07:30.194
On Monday we have a basketball final match.
Are you coming? On Monday I'll be in Bruxelles ...

07:30.399 --> 07:33.915
... for the agreement on the red beets.

07:34.120 --> 07:38.557
- Too bad! It's going to be a nice match.
- I don't care about basketball.

07:38.759 --> 07:43.788
- By the way, no rain here. 
- What can I do about it?

07:44.000 --> 07:48.835
You can pray. - I pray every night.
Pray more.

07:49.759 --> 07:51.796
Elia ...

07:52.120 --> 07:55.430
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

07:55.639 --> 08:00.430
Don't you think it's time
to think about your future?

08:00.639 --> 08:05.031
- At your age you should ...
- I know ... same old story!

08:05.240 --> 08:10.598
- I am not going to get married.
- You are strong, you are a man ...

08:10.800 --> 08:13.951
... healthy, strong ...
- Hands off!

08:14.160 --> 08:19.598
- It's time to look for a woman.
- And you? - Me what?

08:21.240 --> 08:27.429
I believe there are moments of
passion and desire.

08:27.639 --> 08:32.634
Uncontrollable impulses, moments of torments
when the flesh is torn apart.

08:32.840 --> 08:37.515
- Don't you have such moments?
- Sure. - And what do you do then?

08:40.159 --> 08:44.995
- I go into the wood hut
and cut the woods. And you?

08:46.879 --> 08:49.553
I ring the bells.

08:50.799 --> 08:53.439
Do you ring them often?

08:57.240 --> 09:00.232
Bye, Cirillo. See you around.

09:02.080 --> 09:06.790
Come on, guys! Let's ring the bells.
I mean, let's play basketball.

09:07.000 --> 09:10.754
Come on! Jump!

09:21.000 --> 09:25.915
Tonio, this is not a sowing season.
- This is wheat for the crows.

09:26.159 --> 09:29.914
Feeding the crows means that you are a nice person.

09:30.120 --> 09:33.635
- Which kind of wheat is it?
- It's poisoned.

09:33.840 --> 09:37.037
So they will all die!

09:37.240 --> 09:41.119
- Not even one will be left!
- Why you do that?

09:41.320 --> 09:46.314
Dry season, and the crows too!
I plant oat, and they eat it.

09:46.519 --> 09:51.469
I plant corn, and they eat it.
And what shall I eat?

09:51.679 --> 09:57.152
- If I don't kill them, I'll starve.
- Why don't you talk to them.

09:57.360 --> 10:01.478
What do you mean?
They are all black and ugly!

10:01.679 --> 10:04.672
They should die all at once!

10:09.039 --> 10:12.669
Shut up!

10:12.879 --> 10:15.235
Who's the boss here?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.671
Are you sure?

10:18.879 --> 10:23.237
Beyond the river
there is a wonderful field.

10:23.440 --> 10:28.798
The owners abandoned it. Two hectares.

10:29.000 --> 10:33.118
There's food for the all of you down there.

10:35.159 --> 10:37.196
Go!

10:46.360 --> 10:49.830
Animals are not like man,
you can talk to them!

10:51.639 --> 10:53.676
Remember that.

11:01.080 --> 11:05.790
Hi, Elia. - Did I say hi to you?
- Damn!

11:09.440 --> 11:12.830
- Good morning, boss.
- Hi, Michele.

11:13.879 --> 11:17.714
- Hi, Elia!
- Take care of the bushes! - I will.

11:18.919 --> 11:21.593
- Hi, Biagi.
- Hi, Elia.

11:25.080 --> 11:29.312
- Hi, Elia.
- Hi, cutie. - Hi.

11:32.720 --> 11:38.431
- Hello. - Have a nice day.
- Thanks. Bye, guys.

11:48.919 --> 11:52.515
Today you avoided me.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.232
Damn! She plays music.

12:36.360 --> 12:40.876
- Who's she?
- Who are you talking about?

12:41.080 --> 12:45.835
- You know who. Who's she?
- She's a nice woman.

12:46.039 --> 12:50.033
She's the niece of a friend of mine
who lives in town.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.870
She's good. She's 29, a teacher's degree,
she can cook ...

12:55.080 --> 12:58.152
Can you hear? It looks like an angel!

12:58.360 --> 13:03.434
I don't want foreign people in my house,
women especially. - I know.

13:03.639 --> 13:07.315
But you could talk to her for a while.

13:07.519 --> 13:12.469
- If you talk to her, she'll not be a stranger anymore.
- Do you think so? I do.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.992
I studied music at the conservatory.

13:28.200 --> 13:33.752
During the final exam I played
"Notturno 18" from Chopin.

13:33.960 --> 13:33.960
I play for myself ...

13:38.039 --> 13:42.830
... to improve my soul. Music improves
our own sensations.

13:43.039 --> 13:48.512
I don't need to work.
I inherited a good sum of money.

13:48.720 --> 13:55.239
When I'll decide to get married, 
if I'll ever find the right person ...

13:55.440 --> 14:00.560
I am not looking for a prince.
I don't need him to be handsome.

14:00.759 --> 14:05.629
Appearance is not everything. 
Man beauty is relative, isn't it?

14:05.840 --> 14:12.029
What is important is that he's kind,
well-behaved and with a nice smile.

14:12.240 --> 14:15.232
Eh! Eh! Eh!

14:29.399 --> 14:35.316
- What happened? Where did she go?
- Who? The girl.

14:35.519 --> 14:40.389
- She had something urgent to do.
- Tell me the truth!

14:40.600 --> 14:44.798
- You did Frankenstein?
- Nope, I did Dracula.

14:45.000 --> 14:49.471
- Come here! I like your dark blood!
- Leave me alone!

14:49.679 --> 14:54.390
We must hire 20 farmers
to press the grapes.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.799
It is going to be very expensive.

15:00.000 --> 15:05.711
- Is that your money? - No, it's yours.
- Why? - Because it's not mine.

15:05.919 --> 15:10.914
- Go on. As your accountant
and administrator ...

15:11.120 --> 15:14.510
... I suggest you to buy a machine.

15:14.720 --> 15:21.512
A presser that makes the job
of 3 men in half-time!

15:23.879 --> 15:29.398
- What about the families of the unemployed farmers?
- Progress can be cruel.

15:30.559 --> 15:35.475
Can you assure me that this machine
performs the job of 3 men in half-time?

15:35.679 --> 15:39.992
- Hundred times hundred!
- What's the result?

15:40.200 --> 15:43.351
- Ten thousand.
- Why?

15:43.559 --> 15:45.915
That's life!

15:46.120 --> 15:53.037
(singing)
Come on!.

15:53.240 --> 15:56.835
(singing).

15:57.440 --> 16:01.479
"Press hard and sing along"

16:01.679 --> 16:04.672
"Golden grapes ...

16:06.639 --> 16:09.996
... sweety treasure".

16:11.600 --> 16:14.637
"Don't stop"

16:14.840 --> 16:19.072
"Press hard and sing along"

16:28.960 --> 16:34.080
"You are strong and will win!"

16:35.159 --> 16:38.357
"Grapes and happiness".

16:39.000 --> 16:42.117
"You'll make it".

16:42.320 --> 16:46.632
"Don't stop".

16:53.039 --> 16:58.910
"Each drop is a treasure".

17:01.720 --> 17:04.712
"Don't stop".

17:05.680 --> 17:08.955
"You are the strongest,
and you'll win".

17:10.358 --> 17:13.909
"If you believe in what you do ...

17:15.240 --> 17:18.710
... you'll see you can make it".

17:18.920 --> 17:22.390
"Like the fly of a seagull"

17:23.720 --> 17:27.076
"You are strong and you will make it!"

17:32.079 --> 17:34.071
"Flowers and fantasy"

17:36.559 --> 17:39.836
"Come on!"

17:41.039 --> 17:44.237
"Party of colors".

17:45.279 --> 17:48.955
"Press hard and sing along"

18:15.079 --> 18:18.675
"green leaves, blue sky ..."

18:29.559 --> 18:34.111
"You'll make it"

18:38.920 --> 18:43.994
- Good! - Will you buy it? - No.
I'll buy another machine. - Which one?

18:44.200 --> 18:48.512
An adding machine. It makes the job 
of three accountants in half-time.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.076
You won! Good, Elia!

18:52.279 --> 18:55.670
- It's raining!
- Is it raining? - Yes, it is.

18:55.880 --> 19:00.112
- It's raining!
- Is it raining? - Yes, let's go!

19:09.160 --> 19:12.152
Check!

19:14.160 --> 19:17.516
I'm going to the wine cellar.

19:19.200 --> 19:22.749
I won't play with you anymore.

19:22.960 --> 19:25.952
I can't accept your excuses.

19:26.880 --> 19:31.271
Bell! Bell.

19:31.839 --> 19:36.277
Can you open the door?

19:40.599 --> 19:42.795
Can you open?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.991
I open.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.429
- May I come in?
- Why?

20:06.640 --> 20:08.710
Because it's raining.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.991
Not so much.

20:19.200 --> 20:23.478
Well? Will you let me in?
- I don't know you.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.196
- My name is Lisa.
- That's not your fault.

20:28.400 --> 20:33.474
- Don't be silly!
I'm getting wet. - Me too.

20:33.680 --> 20:38.071
The water falls on your hat ...

20:38.279 --> 20:44.435
... and splashes on my shirt.
- You have 5 seconds to let me in.

20:55.880 --> 21:01.716
It's pouring down, there are no other houses
and I'm tired.  Let me in!

21:09.599 --> 21:13.798
My car broke.
I'm looking for a place to sleep.

21:14.000 --> 21:18.516
- I can recommend you an hotel.
- Is there an hotel? - Hotel Corona.

21:18.720 --> 21:23.475
- Three stars.
- Where is it? - 15 km away.

21:23.680 --> 21:27.036
Can you take me by car?

21:30.559 --> 21:34.951
- I can't. - I can't walk 15 km
under the rain!

21:35.160 --> 21:39.756
I can give you my bike.
- Please, let me sleep here!

21:42.440 --> 21:45.955
- As you prefer, but here is stiff.
- Where? - Here.

21:46.160 --> 21:51.154
Are we monsters?
Can't we let this lady in?

21:51.359 --> 21:56.354
I would like to smash your head
and put some kindness inside!

21:56.559 --> 22:01.509
Come in, miss.
You can sleep in the guestroom.

22:01.720 --> 22:06.430
- Is there a guestroom?
- Yes, we just never use it. Follow me.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.632
Thanks. Very kind of you!

22:10.720 --> 22:15.510
- I need my suitcase to get a change.
- Where is it? - In the car, outside.

22:15.720 --> 22:20.191
- The suitcase is outside.
- I heard that. You go and get it.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.235
- Me? It's raining! You go.
- I am not going. - What?

22:25.440 --> 22:28.079
Who is going?

22:29.079 --> 22:32.117
Are you going?

22:32.319 --> 22:37.440
- She can go, she's already wet!
- You are crazy! I go. 

22:37.640 --> 22:42.589
- Give me the umbrella, I'll get it.
- You can sit by the fireplace ...

22:42.799 --> 22:47.749
... or you'll get sick.
I knew I would be the one to go!

22:49.319 --> 22:52.312
Tell me something.

22:55.599 --> 22:59.388
I'm talking to you. Are you listening?

23:00.480 --> 23:04.678
Aren't you listening?
- Why should I listen to you?

23:04.880 --> 23:09.829
You came imperiously into my house,
you splashed my shirt.

23:10.039 --> 23:16.513
My dog checked.
I can't listen to you.

23:16.920 --> 23:23.029
You can say whatever you want, I can't listen.
- Are you always so rude to women?

23:23.240 --> 23:28.314
Am I rude?
- You get angry, you don't look at me! 

23:37.839 --> 23:40.479
Just move a little bit.

23:44.599 --> 23:49.230
Move away from the fire.
- Why? - You are burning.

23:49.440 --> 23:54.309
- Me? - Your dress is burning.
I can't stand smoke.

23:58.119 --> 24:01.715
This is the guestroom.

24:04.480 --> 24:08.871
That's nice!
- I hoped someday somebody ...

24:09.079 --> 24:11.958
... would use it.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.835
I'll prepare the bed for you.

24:16.039 --> 24:20.033
I'll put two blankets.
Night is cold here.

24:21.759 --> 24:25.116
This is the bathroom.

24:29.480 --> 24:34.270
Thanks. I don't know how to do without you.
- Please, excuse him.

24:34.480 --> 24:39.793
He's a wild bear. But he's a nice man.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.630
- Nice?
- This is the wardrobe.

24:47.279 --> 24:51.990
- Can I make a call?
- Sure, I'll connect you. - Thanks.

24:57.359 --> 25:02.150
- Done. I bet you are hungry.

25:02.359 --> 25:05.750
Dinner is in half hour.

25:05.960 --> 25:10.590
Is dinner ready?
Yes. We have a guest.

25:10.799 --> 25:15.999
Are you going to eat dressed like that?
You should at least wear a tie.

25:24.400 --> 25:27.073
TELEPHONE RINGING

25:28.119 --> 25:32.398
Hallo? - Hi, Renata.
- Lisa! What happened?

25:32.599 --> 25:36.991
You left Portofino at 4!
Vittorio is worried. Where are you?

25:37.200 --> 25:42.957
The car is broken and it's raining.
I am lodging in a farmhouse.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.152
I'll call Vittorio. Vittorio!

25:46.359 --> 25:49.557
- It' Lisa.
- Thanks.

25:49.759 --> 25:53.230
- Lisa! Where are you?
- I am in Rovignano.

25:53.440 --> 25:56.796
- It's near Voghera.
- I can come to pick you up.

25:57.000 --> 26:00.436
No problem, I'll sleep here.
See you tomorrow.

26:00.640 --> 26:05.714
It's only half hour by car.  No,
don't worry. I'll call you tomorrow.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.869
- Are you sure? - Yes, I am. Kiss.
- What do you say? - Kiss, goodbye.

26:11.079 --> 26:15.995
- Ok, I'll talk to her.
- Renata wants to speak to you.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.909
- Well? - Well?
- There's something strange with you.

26:20.119 --> 26:25.114
Are you spending the night in a farmhouse?
Is he a nice man? - Who? -

26:25.319 --> 26:31.759
The owner. Is he nice?
- He's weird, mysterious.

26:31.960 --> 26:38.069
- He's charming!
- That looks serious ...

26:38.279 --> 26:44.515
- I like him

26:44.720 --> 26:49.077
- Just tell me how he looks like.
- I can't. I'm having dinner with him soon.

26:49.279 --> 26:52.477
I need to look nice. Bye.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.471
- Mamie!

27:03.000 --> 27:06.470
See? I'm wearing a tie.

27:08.319 --> 27:12.233
I know I should also wear a coat ...

27:12.440 --> 27:15.432
- Is dinner ready?
- Yes, it is.

27:16.839 --> 27:21.868
- We must WAIT for our guest.
- But we said half hour!

27:22.079 --> 27:25.390
It's more than 31 minutes. I am eating.

27:46.559 --> 27:51.315
What a nice butterfly!
It's an "euchelia nupta".

27:51.519 --> 27:57.709
It's a very rare nocturnal species.
There are 20 left all over Europe.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.151
- Do you like it?
- It's cute.

28:01.359 --> 28:05.478
- Look, Mamie. Do you like it?
- It's disgusting!

28:06.160 --> 28:10.836
- Is it really disgusting?
- Yes, it is.

28:12.440 --> 28:16.592
Collectors would pay a lot of money to have it.

28:18.839 --> 28:22.515
- Do you like animals?
- A lot.

28:23.599 --> 28:25.591
- And people?

28:27.680 --> 28:30.672
Not so much, especially if they are strangers.

28:30.880 --> 28:34.953
Then we could try to become
less strangers to each other.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.391
I don't know your name.

28:41.079 --> 28:45.153
- What's your name?
- Lisa. And yours?

28:45.359 --> 28:49.592
Elia.
- Nice name.

28:49.920 --> 28:55.631
It's the name of a prophet
and you look mysterious too.

28:55.839 --> 29:00.550
- Can you tell the future? - I do.
- And what can you tell?

29:02.680 --> 29:07.276
That your soup will get cold
if you keep talking.

29:08.599 --> 29:10.591
I am thirsty.

29:35.119 --> 29:37.111
Thanks.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.717
- You know something, Elia? 
Elia?

29:45.920 --> 29:50.914
Yes. I was thinking
you have a nice house.

29:51.119 --> 29:56.148
It's comfortable, warm, silent.
I live in the centre of Milan.

29:56.359 --> 30:02.230
There's a lot of traffic.
I can't even sleep at night.

30:02.440 --> 30:07.230
I went to Portofino to relax.
But I met the same old people ...

30:07.440 --> 30:09.635
... like in Milano.

30:09.839 --> 30:13.230
In Portofino I own a house on the beach.
You are invited.

30:13.440 --> 30:18.230
- What about next summer?
- I must work in the fields.

30:18.440 --> 30:22.991
- What about next December, on the snow?
- I must work to bottle the wine.

30:23.200 --> 30:27.193
- Don't you never go on holiday?
- I don't need to.

30:27.400 --> 30:31.996
Holiday is when you do something you don't like.
I like my job.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.716
But you have time to red ...
Interesting bookshelf!

30:36.920 --> 30:41.232
I read before going to sleep.
I like spy stories. And you?

30:41.440 --> 30:44.432
I have no preferences.

30:45.119 --> 30:48.396
- What happened?
- The electric power is off.

30:48.599 --> 30:51.592
- Hold my hand. I am scared.

30:54.519 --> 30:57.557
Happy birthday to you.

30:57.759 --> 31:01.230
Happy birthday to you.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.876
Happy birthday, dear Elia.

31:05.079 --> 31:09.232
Happy birthday to you!

31:10.000 --> 31:13.959
- Is it your birthday? - Yes, it is.
- Happy birthday!.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.676
What shall I do? - Blow the candles.
And a very big blow.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.992
Shit! Too big!

31:32.680 --> 31:36.992
- one, two, three, four ...
- They're forty. - Are you 40?

31:37.200 --> 31:41.432
- You look younger. - I know.
- I am 25.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.713
- I wouldn't say that. - Thanks.
- You look 26.

31:49.599 --> 31:52.273
Stupid!

31:52.480 --> 31:58.999
Miss, he's not a nice person!

32:00.200 --> 32:04.113
- You are so rude!
- I was kidding.

32:05.519 --> 32:09.479
Can you believe I was kidding?

32:15.440 --> 32:17.476
A little gift.

32:19.400 --> 32:22.631
- Is it for me?
- Sure.

32:22.839 --> 32:26.355
I bought it in Portofino

32:34.720 --> 32:40.033
- What is it? - Don't ask, just open it!

32:58.759 --> 33:01.069
Where shall I put it?

33:01.279 --> 33:04.272
I can put it here.

33:04.480 --> 33:08.234
No, better here.
Or here.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.238
Here it looks fine.

33:11.440 --> 33:14.955
It's not raining anymore!

33:15.160 --> 33:19.597
- Well?
- You can go to the hotel.

33:19.799 --> 33:24.510
- Do you want me to walk 15km? - I do.

33:26.960 --> 33:32.910
You're crazy! - Walking after dinner
helps to digest and to sleep.

33:33.119 --> 33:38.956
- It's far away!
- I can give you my bike.

33:39.160 --> 33:44.280
- I never gave it to anybody.
Later I can have it back.

33:47.799 --> 33:51.839
Or you can keep it, if you want.
I can buy another one.

33:52.920 --> 33:55.036
Fine, I got it.

33:55.640 --> 33:59.679
Thanks to this farmer gentleman.
Thanks for the dinner ...

33:59.880 --> 34:04.874
... for the cake I didn't eat,
and for the friendship I didn't get!

34:07.759 --> 34:11.116
Stupid and rude!

34:12.159 --> 34:14.196
Scoundrel!

34:18.920 --> 34:23.994
What's the name of the hotel?
-  Hotel Corona.

34:24.199 --> 34:28.112
- I can't even find the yellow pages!

34:35.079 --> 34:37.639
Here they are.

34:39.360 --> 34:43.592
Walking or biking!
They'll pick me up.

34:43.800 --> 34:48.954
- You can go biking!
The sooner I leave this place, the better!

34:49.159 --> 34:53.915
- I can't stay one minute more!
Who does he thinks he is?

34:54.119 --> 34:56.475
Your suitcase is ready.

34:56.679 --> 35:00.229
- Hotel Corona ...
- Here's the number, 72010.

35:05.119 --> 35:08.112
- Is this yours?
- Yes, it is.

35:17.400 --> 35:22.030
Hallo?  Speaking to Hotel Corona?
- No, this is a gas station.

35:22.239 --> 35:27.872
- Can I book a room? - This is a
gas station. Need gas?

35:28.079 --> 35:32.312
- A single with bathroom.
- Need water for the battery?

35:32.519 --> 35:37.674
- Not even a double?
- Need gas?

35:37.880 --> 35:42.112
I understand, you're full.
It doesn't matter. Thanks

35:44.000 --> 35:47.037
I'll report to the Tourism Department!

35:49.559 --> 35:51.551
Fuck!

35:51.760 --> 35:56.515
What can I do now? Is there another hotel
on top of the mountain somewhere?

35:56.719 --> 35:59.712
Or can I have the honor 
to sleep in the stable?

35:59.920 --> 36:03.469
Fine, you can stay.
But only for tonight.

36:20.599 --> 36:24.798
- If you were not 40 I would spank you.
- Why?

36:28.000 --> 36:32.915
You go to bed early, I don't.
Where can I go?

36:33.119 --> 36:37.238
It's only 10 PM.
- That's true, it's early.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.557
SHUT UP! Play something.

36:42.719 --> 36:47.589
Is there a theatre? - Yes, there is.
- Fine! - It is open only on thursday.

36:49.159 --> 36:53.711
- Is there a place to listen at some music?
- It's closed.

36:53.920 --> 36:58.436
If you want some music,
Mamie plays much better than Casadei.

36:58.639 --> 37:02.030
- Isn't that true, Mamie?
- That's true.

37:04.079 --> 37:09.029
- There's nothing to do here!
- You can look at Ganimede. - A friend of yours?

37:09.239 --> 37:14.553
It's the third satellite of Jupiter.
- How funny ...!

37:14.960 --> 37:19.511
It is situated between Europe and Callisto.
It was discovered by Galileo.

37:19.719 --> 37:24.077
Let's go on the roof.
Maybe we will see it.

37:24.280 --> 37:28.398
- Ganimede is very shiny.
I am not interested in astronomy.

37:28.599 --> 37:32.639
- Let's watch some TV.
- I don't have a TV. - Yes, you do.

37:32.840 --> 37:37.550
There's a TV upstairs.

37:37.760 --> 37:39.830
- I can have a look, but I know there isn't.

37:43.039 --> 37:47.830
- There it is! - This one?
I've always used it as a stool.

37:49.199 --> 37:53.159
I use to sit here and count.
- Let's go!

37:53.360 --> 37:56.352
I think Ganimede was a better idea.

38:05.079 --> 38:08.789
I like comedies a lot.

38:20.159 --> 38:23.152
Aren't they funny?

38:25.639 --> 38:27.676
No, they aren't.

38:29.280 --> 38:33.193
Look what's happening!

38:34.320 --> 38:37.471
Did you see how he fall?

38:38.679 --> 38:42.309
Look! Isn't that funny?

38:46.480 --> 38:50.553
- I'm sorry for him.
- Somebody falling is comic!

38:53.440 --> 38:55.431
He's hurt!

39:00.320 --> 39:04.108
How can you cry,
This is the basis of humor!

39:14.239 --> 39:18.472
It's mathematic. The banana peel
and a well dressed man.

39:18.679 --> 39:23.435
The man slips on the banana peel,
falls and that should makes you laugh.

39:23.639 --> 39:26.279
You don't laugh.

39:28.000 --> 39:32.278
- No. - You don't like comedies,
you don't like to laugh.

39:32.480 --> 39:34.471
You don't like anything!

39:36.000 --> 39:38.594
- No.
- Bye.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.991
Bye.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.316
Ouch!

39:54.840 --> 39:56.831
Ouch!

39:58.400 --> 40:02.188
- Are you hurt?
- Yes, a lot!

40:07.239 --> 40:09.231
Are you laughing?

40:10.519 --> 40:14.752
You said when somebody gets hurt,
people should laugh.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.952
Are you really hurt?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.594
She's hurt!

40:29.960 --> 40:33.635
I will help you. Carefully.

40:33.840 --> 40:36.832
Put your hand here.

40:39.239 --> 40:41.276
That's it.

40:48.199 --> 40:51.351
We've arrived.

40:53.159 --> 40:56.948
- What are you doing?
- I like your ears.

40:59.239 --> 41:02.232
Time to sleep.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.796
Goodnight.

41:08.760 --> 41:10.796
Goodnight.

41:59.559 --> 42:03.758
Elia, did you repair Miss Lisa's car?

42:03.960 --> 42:05.951
One moment!

42:10.440 --> 42:14.399
What?

43:20.639 --> 43:24.838
- What time is it?
- It's very late. It's 7 AM.

43:25.039 --> 43:30.273
- The sun is shining and the car is fixed.
- Good morning, Elia.

43:30.480 --> 43:35.349
Good morning. Or better, goodbye.
I am going to work.

43:35.559 --> 43:40.634
- See you when I'll go to Milan.
- When? - In a couple of years.

43:40.840 --> 43:44.515
- Ouch!
- What's up?

43:44.719 --> 43:48.759
My foot hurts.
It's because I fell yesterday.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.838
I think it's swollen.

43:56.079 --> 44:00.153
- Ouch!
- Does it hurt here? - Yes, it does.

44:00.360 --> 44:04.194
- And here?
- Ouch!

44:04.400 --> 44:08.712
Here too?
- Yes. - Get off.

44:11.159 --> 44:14.311
I'll try to walk.
Ouch!

44:14.519 --> 44:18.229
I can't walk.
What a terrible pain!

44:18.440 --> 44:23.355
I'm sorry to create trouble,
but I can't leave.

44:24.800 --> 44:27.997
I'll call the veterinary.
- Don't! I know myself.

44:28.199 --> 44:34.150
I've already sprained once.
Two days at rest and it will go away.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.039
- Why don't you stay with me for a while?
- I'm busy.

45:07.159 --> 45:12.553
- Where're you going? - At Ernesto's place.
- He has pneumonia!

45:12.760 --> 45:16.355
- Did I ask you how is he doing?
- No, you didn't.

45:20.400 --> 45:22.391
The door!

45:23.280 --> 45:25.271
The shoes!

45:26.840 --> 45:28.831
The window!

45:59.639 --> 46:05.078
- Are you making a call? - I am.
- Without asking fro permission? - Nope.

46:05.280 --> 46:07.271
Fine.

46:24.960 --> 46:28.669
Hallo. Hallo! Who's speaking?

46:39.920 --> 46:42.036
The window!

46:42.239 --> 46:46.119
The shoes! The door!

46:55.920 --> 46:59.390
Did you read what they think about you?
That person is not you!

47:57.360 --> 48:01.148
What are you doing? Are you crazy? Stop!

48:02.480 --> 48:07.349
Stop! Where are we going?

48:07.559 --> 48:10.154
Put me down!

48:10.360 --> 48:12.874
You are crazy!

48:14.920 --> 48:18.799
Stop!

48:19.039 --> 48:21.076
Stop!

48:22.320 --> 48:24.436
Take this!

48:24.639 --> 48:26.915
ldiot! Stupid!

48:28.519 --> 48:30.556
Stop!

48:33.159 --> 48:36.755
Put me down!

48:36.960 --> 48:42.353
Damn! I hate you!

48:44.960 --> 48:46.996
Stop!

49:15.320 --> 49:18.869
Bastard! Stupid!
Selfish!

49:19.079 --> 49:22.789
Who do you think you are?

49:23.000 --> 49:27.437
If you want to go to Hotel Corona,
you should know it's close for restoration!

49:27.639 --> 49:30.837
That's a real woman!

49:35.880 --> 49:40.271
And she smells nice!
- What do you want? > She's cute.

49:53.000 --> 49:55.036
Barbarian!

49:55.440 --> 49:57.476
Impertinent!

49:57.840 --> 50:01.276
Brute!

50:04.199 --> 50:07.192
Monster!

50:07.400 --> 50:10.119
Son of a bitch!

50:11.039 --> 50:13.554
Stupid!

50:13.760 --> 50:16.957
Silly!

50:17.159 --> 50:19.913
Mentally handicapped!

50:20.119 --> 50:24.398
Stronzo! - Are you talking to me?
- What do you want? Gas!

50:28.719 --> 50:31.109
I am such a stupid!

50:31.320 --> 50:36.792
I'll give him a lesson!

50:39.199 --> 50:41.509
And the gas?

50:41.719 --> 50:45.156
Last night they though I was a porter.

50:45.360 --> 50:50.912
Today she insults me and runs away.
Not a good day. Closed.

50:51.119 --> 50:55.830
Do you want to tell me a vulgar joke?

50:59.840 --> 51:02.798
You are such a  pork.

51:17.440 --> 51:19.715
Something wrong?

51:28.920 --> 51:30.911
You hit me!

51:34.239 --> 51:36.390
That was the bucket.

51:45.360 --> 51:50.912
You are so stupid, so coarse, so rogue!

51:51.119 --> 51:55.591
And what else?
- You are so arrogant.

51:55.800 --> 52:00.032
- I got it, you are in love with me.
- Who, me?

52:00.239 --> 52:05.997
Are you or not? Which is your affirmative answer?
- Well ... Yes, I am.

52:08.360 --> 52:12.399
- Just a small detail.
- Which one? - I am not in love with you.

52:17.639 --> 52:19.551
- It's the bucket's fault!

52:25.039 --> 52:27.031
That's incredible!

52:29.280 --> 52:33.956
What? - How many times I told to a man ...

52:34.159 --> 52:38.073
... what you just told me.
- Well?

52:38.280 --> 52:43.400
I was not in love and I've said it many times.

52:43.599 --> 52:47.673
I would never believe it could happen to me.

52:47.880 --> 52:51.919
- Don't get angry.
- I am not angry, I am smiling.

52:53.480 --> 52:57.314
When the bird in the cages smiles,
then he's angry.

52:57.519 --> 53:01.513
 Birds don't smile, they sing.
- It depends ...

53:01.719 --> 53:05.474
If you tell him a nice story ...

53:05.679 --> 53:09.559
Once there was a bird ...
- Goodbye.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.069
Goodbye?
- I am leaving.

53:12.280 --> 53:15.272
- What do you think?
What do YOU think!

53:15.480 --> 53:20.110
It would have been a mistake,
a wrong choice.

53:21.840 --> 53:24.593
How do you know?

53:24.800 --> 53:29.510
A woman like you, living between
Milan, Portofino, CORTONA.

53:29.719 --> 53:32.712
- Cortina!
- Right ...

53:32.920 --> 53:37.710
A woman like you can't fall in love 
with a farmer.

53:37.920 --> 53:42.118
You could not resist one week
with the chickens and the pigs.

53:42.320 --> 53:47.348
Stop guessing what I might think!
I would like it a lot, on the contrary.

53:51.000 --> 53:56.597
It's a hard life. You must always work.
No parties.

53:56.800 --> 54:01.920
Let me try. - No kidding!
- Let me stay and pay you back.

54:02.119 --> 54:06.272
Yes or not?
Which is your affirmative answer?

54:07.639 --> 54:11.952
- You are more stubborn than a mule.
- Finally you give me a compliment!

54:12.159 --> 54:17.234
Well? - You are hired until Monday.
- Why Monday?

54:17.440 --> 54:21.797
- Because on Monday I am going to Bruxelles.
- But today is Saturday!

54:22.000 --> 54:26.755
- But it's still almost noon.
- Fine.

54:36.840 --> 54:38.717
- Mamie!

54:40.880 --> 54:45.112
I made it!

54:46.360 --> 54:51.150
-What did you do?
- Elia told me I can stay.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.116
That's a miracle!

55:04.599 --> 55:09.594
- Lisa, Where are you? - In Rovignano.
- Still there?

55:09.800 --> 55:14.396
- I found a job.
- You? - I am a farmer.

55:14.599 --> 55:17.114
- Are you feeling well?
- Yes, I am.

55:17.320 --> 55:21.871
It's so nice here with the trees,
the pigs and the chickens.

55:22.079 --> 55:26.073
You never cared about countryside!

55:26.280 --> 55:29.272
Tell me, is there any problem?

55:29.480 --> 55:34.474
I can leave my work for one day and be with you.
- No, everything is ok.

55:34.679 --> 55:39.117
- I just want to stay alone and think.
- Bullshit! - What?

55:39.320 --> 55:43.916
When you finish to think you just give me a call!

55:45.320 --> 55:47.550
Flowers, fantasy.

55:48.519 --> 55:52.559
Today is a happy day.

55:54.000 --> 55:56.719
Colors all over!

55:57.559 --> 56:01.553
Keep on working and smile with us!

56:02.679 --> 56:05.990
The air is light ...

56:06.199 --> 56:09.112
... when spring arrives.

56:11.440 --> 56:14.318
Don't stop!

56:15.400 --> 56:19.234
You are strong and you can make it.

56:20.239 --> 56:23.437
If you believe in what you do ...

56:25.000 --> 56:28.595
... you'll make it!

56:29.760 --> 56:32.991
You are like a seagull.

56:33.199 --> 56:36.636
You are strong and will make it.

56:37.039 --> 56:39.031
You'll make it!

56:39.239 --> 56:42.232
How magic!

56:42.840 --> 56:45.832
Blooming fields around you.

56:47.960 --> 56:49.951
How poetic!

56:51.920 --> 56:55.117
Keep on working and smile with us!

56:56.360 --> 56:59.318
The sky is bright.

57:01.079 --> 57:03.833
Everything looks nice.

57:05.760 --> 57:08.593
Don't stop.

57:09.840 --> 57:13.389
You are strong and you'll make it.

57:13.599 --> 57:15.397
Hi.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.637
- Hi, Elia.
- Jump! Hi!

57:21.920 --> 57:23.911
Hi!

57:24.960 --> 57:27.952
- Anybody missing?
- Only one.

57:29.920 --> 57:32.150
- Wait.
- Ouch!

57:34.679 --> 57:36.750
Ouch!

57:37.800 --> 57:39.791
Ouch!

57:40.800 --> 57:42.791
Go!

57:54.920 --> 57:59.072
Look in which conditions is she!

58:00.920 --> 58:02.911
Slaver!

58:03.840 --> 58:08.038
How did it go today in the farmhouse?

58:09.719 --> 58:13.235
Shall we go party tonight?

58:14.159 --> 58:17.277
Shall we go dancing?

58:17.480 --> 58:21.871
There's a new disco 35km from here.

58:22.079 --> 58:27.473
We could take the bike.

58:28.719 --> 58:31.393
I am exhausted!

58:31.599 --> 58:36.549
You were right, I am no good at farm works.
I can just give trouble.

58:36.760 --> 58:40.753
I am no good at all.
- Don't exaggerate.

58:40.960 --> 58:43.952
You are just a bit depressed.

58:44.159 --> 58:46.151
Dry off.

58:46.360 --> 58:50.592
You need something to cheer up.

58:54.280 --> 58:59.035
- Some grappa. Mamie made it. - 
- No!

58:59.239 --> 59:03.552
- Spirits weigh me down.
- Fine, no spirit!

59:03.760 --> 59:07.878
- What would you like?
- There's only one think to cheer me up.

59:08.679 --> 59:10.716
I would like some pot.

59:13.480 --> 59:17.473
Some pot, to smoke.
- I don't have any.

59:18.320 --> 59:23.189
- Don't look at me like that!
I know you're a healthy farmer.

59:23.400 --> 59:28.394
But I like it and it's good.
But here it's difficult to find it, isn't it?

59:31.599 --> 59:33.636
Not for me.

01:00:01.599 --> 01:00:04.433
How nice of you! Thanks.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.796
Do you want to smoke?
- Nope.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.639
Can't tell what you are missing!

01:00:31.599 --> 01:00:33.909
I'm already feeling better.

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:38.951
I feel like singing, shouting, dancing.
I want to go out.

01:00:39.159 --> 01:00:45.110
I want to have fun. Don't be a mummy!
Let's go!

01:00:46.079 --> 01:00:50.073
I can't go out, I need to change.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.755
Let's see... Shall I wear this one?
No, you are right.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.757
No.

01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.679
This one? No, that's too simple.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.751
Here it is!

01:01:07.639 --> 01:01:13.033
I can wear this one.
What do you think? Do you like it?

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:18.112
You know what, my dear mummy?

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:23.553
I love tomatoes, I love cows,
and I love a lot the farm life.

01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:28.038
It's fantastic!
I can learn, it's easy.

01:01:28.239 --> 01:01:31.152
You are not depressed anymore.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:35.831
No, I am fine!
I am happy and satisfied.

01:01:36.039 --> 01:01:39.032
And you even look a nice man!

01:01:39.239 --> 01:01:45.156
I didn't know that endive would have
this effects on you. - Endive?

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:50.798
Am I smoking endive?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.994
Sure, I can't give you marijuana.
- You are a monster!

01:01:56.199 --> 01:01:59.670
Cheater! Swindler!

01:02:12.119 --> 01:02:16.910
That was a pair of Chinese vases from
Tang dinasty, very valuable...

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:21.591
..and rare.
What shall I do with this one?

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:24.030
- Don't!
- I don't need it anymore. - Don't!

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:26.959
- It's useless now.
- Don't!

01:02:32.239 --> 01:02:34.834
- May I ?
- Yes!

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:45.198
I am happy. They're finally getting along!

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:03.191
- Nothing left to brake?
- No, that was all.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:08.110
- Let's go dancing, then.
- Dancing? - You suggested it before.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:13.792
- Are you tired? - You are tired.
- I am awake. - I am more awake than you are.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.468
I am more awake than you are.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:07.392
Were you sleeping?
- No. You were sleeping.

01:04:07.599 --> 01:04:12.435
How do you know? You were sleeping.
-You were. - No, you were!

01:04:12.639 --> 01:04:16.633
Let's go to sleep. - It's early!
Tomorrow is Sunday.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.038
- Wake up at 5 am to go hunting.
Let's go to bed. - Ok.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:53.794
They're turtledoves.

01:04:59.639 --> 01:05:02.438
No, they're ducks.

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:08.236
- But ...
Shh! They're coming.

01:05:17.559 --> 01:05:18.993
Here they are!

01:05:28.199 --> 01:05:30.270
He shot me!

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.635
Me too!

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:38.356
That's Elia! Run away!

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:45.431
- They go t what they deserve.
- Good!

01:05:45.639 --> 01:05:50.156
- Do you hate hunting too?
Yes, but I couldn't find the words to tell you.

01:05:52.159 --> 01:05:56.153
Let's get free the hares.

01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:01.150
- And put the traps inside 
the hunters' houses. - Elia!

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:04.511
Giovannella is giving birth!

01:06:04.719 --> 01:06:09.510
It's premature. - Did you call the doctor?
- It's Sunday

01:06:09.719 --> 01:06:13.076
Everybody went to the lake.
I can't do it alone.

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.750
I need help.
- I'll help you.

01:06:35.639 --> 01:06:38.632
It's a FEMALE!

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.311
Weigh? - 15 kg.
- I hoped more.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.992
We'll call her Lisa, is it ok?

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.394
Is it ok?
It's ok.

01:07:05.039 --> 01:07:10.558
- It was better to take the bike.
- Today I treat.

01:07:11.679 --> 01:07:15.753
I'll take you in a wonderful place.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:18.235
You will like it a lot.

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.957
First I need gas.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:27.831
You again!

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:34.397
30,000.
- Are you sure? - I am.

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.511
No comments about my dress ...
- What should I say?

01:07:47.719 --> 01:07:51.918
I am wearing it just for you.
Do you like it?

01:07:52.119 --> 01:07:55.430
- You had it on also yesterday
- No I hadn't.

01:07:55.639 --> 01:08:01.510
Yesterday I was wearing something else.
This is from Valentino. - Isn't it yours?

01:08:01.719 --> 01:08:04.518
Just tell me ...

01:08:04.719 --> 01:08:09.714
- Are you trying to be funny?
- This is my way, funny.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.673
You piss me off!

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:16.872
To you it doesn't matter
what I wear.

01:08:17.078 --> 01:08:21.915
- I could even go out naked!
- You could.

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:24.071
I understand.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.630
Tonight I'll wear this.
Is it fine?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:41.390
- No, it isn't.
You're ashamed! - No, I'm cold.

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:46.196
What the hell are you looking at?
Did you put gas? - I did.

01:08:47.399 --> 01:08:51.518
I've also cleaned the windows.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.631
Everything is alright.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.756
Fuck! 340.OOO liras.
I'm leaving.

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:33.073
Good morning, Miss Silvestri.
There's a table for you.

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:37.152
It's the best. With view on the lake.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:48.200
Fish or meat?
- Fish. They've the best fish.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.591
This is the wine list.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.716
I suggest a white Bourgogne, class'74.
- No. - Why not?

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:04.514
In 1974 in Bourgogne the vines
were damaged by hail.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.917
What kind of fish do you have?
Carp.

01:10:08.119 --> 01:10:12.159
With the carp we should drink
a Mosella white from '76 ...

01:10:12.359 --> 01:10:15.750
... grown on the Rive Gauche,
left side.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:22.399
Then I suggest a Mosella white from '76.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:29.039
- Why? - Because in the '14 the vines
in Bourgogne were damaged by hail.

01:10:30.199 --> 01:10:35.115
How old are you? - I don't know.
- I thought less. - Thanks.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:43.309
You shocked them! Do you like it?

01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:50.873
I'd prefer a darker place.
- You're so romantic!

01:10:51.079 --> 01:10:56.359
I like dark too.
It makes everything uncertain.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.673
We can imagine our neighbor's face.

01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:05.759
Smiling, interesting, loveable.

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:11.478
I'd like a darker place to take off my tie.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:16.674
- Why do you have to spoil everything?
- Me? -Yes, you do.

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.708
- Maybe you don't do it on purpose!
It's a defence behaviour.

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.151
Why don't you relax sometimes?

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.676
Why are you holding my hand?
- Because of my affection for you. Can I?

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.873
Yes. But hold it back when we are eating.

01:11:45.119 --> 01:11:48.157
- This place is so cute.
- Lisa!

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.790
Excuse me.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:56.073
I haven't heard of you for a while!

01:11:56.279 --> 01:12:00.273
He's the farmer! Nice guy.

01:12:00.479 --> 01:12:03.472
Can I sit here for a while?
- Well ... - Thanks.

01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.309
My name is Renata.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:11.513
Vittorio is going crazy.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.874
He says that you found a job in a farm.
- That's true.

01:12:17.079 --> 01:12:21.039
Is he your employer?

01:12:21.239 --> 01:12:24.869
- Yes, he is.
- Now I understand everything!

01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:31.838
Not easy to find such an employer.
Wide shoulders, tanned ...

01:12:32.039 --> 01:12:37.433
... dark eyes, energetic chin ...
- Go on, please. - And funny.

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:42.919
Is there a job for me too in your farm?

01:12:43.119 --> 01:12:47.796
- I've many skills for you to exploit.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.596
- Don't be silly.
- What a jealous woman you are.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:57.316
- Maybe she's in love.
It must be serious.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.511
It's very serious to me.

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:03.998
- Very serious!
- You shouldn't admit it.

01:13:04.199 --> 01:13:09.149
Men get bored when women get serious.

01:13:09.359 --> 01:13:13.035
They like to have fun without problems.

01:13:13.239 --> 01:13:18.234
But you can't get it!
You like big emotions.

01:13:18.439 --> 01:13:21.671
You are looking for the eternal love.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:27.557
But adventures are better...
- I am hungry.

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.231
I'll grab a snack. Keep on talking.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.309
You bitch!

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:42.875
- Hi, Lisa!
- Hi!

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.990
What are you doing?
- What's going on?

01:13:50.039 --> 01:13:52.998
- Ouch!

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.909
No!
Let me go!

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.751
Ouch!

01:14:07.079 --> 01:14:09.071
- Ouch!

01:14:11.039 --> 01:14:14.316
That's enough!

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:19.514
She's teasing my man.
- No, he's teasing me.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.753
Are you teasing my girlfriend?

01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:28.474
No. But if you want, I can tease you.

01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.952
- Ouch!
- Come on, let's see.

01:14:34.159 --> 01:14:36.958
- Wait, I can do that.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.911
This farmer deserves a lesson.

01:14:48.319 --> 01:14:50.311
That was funny!

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:54.513
Thanks for helping me.

01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:58.793
I punched only two of them.
- No, they were three.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.118
And you put his head into the soup ...

01:15:03.319 --> 01:15:07.950
... and the food tray on his legs 
Where are we?

01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:14.270
Why are you stopping?
- I've been after you for 2 days ...

01:15:14.479 --> 01:15:18.439
... I take you out to dinner,
I fight with my friend.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:22.838
Isn't that obvious
that I want to stay alone with you?

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:31.834
I'll tell you a secret.
I like you. I feel good with you.

01:15:32.039 --> 01:15:34.429
That was evident.

01:15:43.399 --> 01:15:45.391
I'm choking ...

01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:48.391
Excuse me.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.717
- Did you like it?
- That's good!

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.311
Strawberry flavour.
- How do you know I like strawberries?

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.798
Who do you think you are?
You are disgusting!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.070
You're boastful!

01:16:16.279 --> 01:16:20.273
I hate you!

01:16:20.479 --> 01:16:25.270
Do you like to walk?
You go back walking!

01:16:27.439 --> 01:16:30.477
Where's the key?

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:37.271
 Give me my keys!
- Take it. - I will.

01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.995
Give it to me!

01:17:04.079 --> 01:17:08.119
- Did you find it?
- I didn't. Help me.

01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:13.110
I am not crazy. These waters
are full of the "hirudo medicinalis".

01:17:13.319 --> 01:17:18.792
- What are they?
- They are a kind of leeches.

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:23.835
They stick to your skin.

01:17:44.399 --> 01:17:49.838
- That didn't stop either.
- That's because you are with me!

01:17:53.079 --> 01:17:56.072
Shall I go further?
Go!

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:04.151
Go!

01:18:16.159 --> 01:18:21.598
- Elia, need a ride?
- Thanks.

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.549
Stop!
Wait me!

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:18.633
- That's incredible!
- What?

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.834
- I had so much fun.

01:19:24.039 --> 01:19:26.554
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.630
Elia!
Yes?

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:34.436
- I don't have much time left to seduce you.
- That's true!

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.634
- Tomorrow you'll go to Bruxelles.
- Yes, but I am leaving in the afternoon.

01:19:41.159 --> 01:19:44.516
You have 18 hours left.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.034
Well, goodnight.

01:19:49.239 --> 01:19:51.231
Goodnight.

01:19:54.119 --> 01:19:56.111
- Lisa!
- Yes?

01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:02.475
- Vittorio is a nice name.
Why don't you marry him?

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.114
Go to the hell!

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.553
I like "Vittorio".

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:15.711
Go to the hell!

01:20:17.159 --> 01:20:20.152
Baldin, stay inside!

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:24.677
He's much better, now.
He is.

01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:30.238
- Next Sunday we'll play a good match.
Mr Mancarani on the phone.

01:20:30.439 --> 01:20:32.431
Excuse me.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.877
Come on!

01:20:35.079 --> 01:20:41.235
- Lisa, can you still remember me?
Yes, I miss you so much.

01:20:41.439 --> 01:20:43.829
Would you come and pick me up.

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:49.034
I'll do that.  
Don't you ask me what have I been doing?

01:20:49.239 --> 01:20:52.789
- No.
- Aren't you interested?

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:56.072
- I am not, dear.
- Stay where you are, then!

01:20:56.279 --> 01:20:57.998
Hallo!

01:22:03.199 --> 01:22:08.228
I thought I say a woman in my bed.

01:22:09.399 --> 01:22:11.391
What are you doing here?

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:16.515
I want to spend my last night with you.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:20.918
- What do you mean?
You know what I mean.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:24.912
- Wait a moment.
- What?

01:22:25.119 --> 01:22:29.875
- We don't know each other very well.
- It doesn't matter.

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:34.392
That's important!
You don't know anything about me.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:37.592
I know what I need to know.

01:22:38.159 --> 01:22:43.154
- We need to talk more.
- You can talk, if you want.

01:22:44.439 --> 01:22:48.479
I was born in a cold winter night ...

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:55.028
... it was august the 4th at 19,20
in this room.

01:22:56.199 --> 01:23:01.194
Downstairs my mum was walking to and fro ...

01:23:01.399 --> 01:23:04.392
... smoking a cigar.

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:08.957
My mum was a tall blond man,
like my grandma.

01:23:09.159 --> 01:23:13.039
But my grandpa had dark hair.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:17.395
My grandpa ...
- Just relax.

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:19.830
Don't be shy.

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:22.751
No!

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.998
You don't like me.
- I can't have sex with a woman ...

01:23:30.199 --> 01:23:35.194
... if I don't love her.
How many times did you fall in love? - Never.

01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.558
Goodbye.

01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:03.632
Hallo? Still you!

01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.914
Lisa, I do care for you.

01:24:09.119 --> 01:24:13.557
- What have you been up to?
- What do you care?

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:16.479
You pick me up!

01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:20.673
Fine, I am coming.
- Good evening.

01:27:25.399 --> 01:27:30.394
Get my suitcase ready.
A suit, shirts, jumpers ...

01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:36.152
... Bruxelles is a cold place.
- You make it, I quit.

01:27:36.359 --> 01:27:39.670
Why?
- You heart is as hard as a stone.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:45.159
You met a nice woman ...

01:27:45.359 --> 01:27:50.753
... and you  kicked her out!

01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:56.115
This is why you quit?
- Yes.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:28:03.233
I don't want to live anymore
with such a sulky sour person.
.

01:28:11.079 --> 01:28:17.474
I like happy people.
Smiling, love, children!

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.876
Old bachelor!

01:28:28.079 --> 01:28:30.355
Go away!

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:33.757
Women are useless!

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.592
Who said women are useful?

01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:39.791
That's better.

01:28:41.439 --> 01:28:45.433
Just the two of us.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.631
Right?

01:28:48.479 --> 01:28:50.914
Can we be happy?

01:28:52.039 --> 01:28:55.271
I don't need an answer! Go away!

01:28:56.119 --> 01:28:58.111
"Lesbian!"

01:29:03.199 --> 01:29:06.192
I feel fine, very fine.

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:09.591
I am very fine.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.955
Flight to Bruxelles. Gate 4-Z.

01:29:16.159 --> 01:29:21.712
Flight Z-74 to Bruxelles.
Boarding now.

01:29:28.279 --> 01:29:30.919
Let me pass.

01:29:46.239 --> 01:29:49.596
Come on, CantÃ¹!

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.753
VOICES

01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:10.277
Cirillo, shouldn't you leave?
- I prefer basketball.

01:31:10.479 --> 01:31:13.995
- Since when?
Since today!

01:31:23.079 --> 01:31:25.753
- How is it going?
What do you think ...?

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.349
- I am asking you.
- I know.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:37.634
We are losing 86 to O.
- We are doing bad. Very bad.

01:31:40.479 --> 01:31:43.472
What are the rules?

01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:48.674
You must put the ball in their basket.

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.308
That's it?

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:30.272
- How is it going?
Very well! t Elia!

01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:48.031
Elia!

01:36:06.039 --> 01:36:09.316
Alt!
(Audience) Elia!

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:12.910
(audience)
Bravo! Bravo!

01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:25.997
Is Sunday ok?
- About what? - We get married.

01:36:26.199 --> 01:36:29.397
- Lisa, do you know him?
Shut up!

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.591
Well?

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:33.597
No.

01:36:35.279 --> 01:36:40.957
- I didn't understand.
- I said no. - Why?

01:36:41.159 --> 01:36:45.153
-She answered.
-Shut up!

01:36:45.359 --> 01:36:47.749
You know why?

01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.512
You never told me.
- What? - That you love me.

01:36:55.079 --> 01:36:59.471
- You know that. - I don't!
Say it now, aloud.

01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:06.558
- That's too many people.
- Say it.

01:37:09.319 --> 01:37:12.756
I love you. - Louder.
- I love you.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.428
- Louder.
- I love you.

01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:19.952
- Louder.
I love you. - Louder!

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.911
I love you!

01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:03.754
Shall we get married? - 
What can i answer? - Yes.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:09.788
Why are you smiling?
You have never had sex before.

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.072
But I've read many books.

01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:46.273
Is it always like that?
- Yes, since 3 days and 3 nights.

01:38:51.039 --> 01:38:56.398
No breakfast, lunch or dinner?
- Nothing!

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.992
- Maybe they need something.
- Let's see.

01:39:06.560 --> 01:39:08.949
Careful.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:13.270
I'd suggest to call a doctor.

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.556
WAIT!

01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:41.512
- What's up?
Are you ok? - I'm very fine.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.713
Lisa, how are you?

01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.911
I am fine.
