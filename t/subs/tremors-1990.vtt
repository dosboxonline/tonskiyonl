00:58.726 --> 01:00.226
Good morning,
Mr. Basset.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.228
This is your
wake-up call.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.021
Please move your ass.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.580
Stampede!

01:21.123 --> 01:22.290
Stampede, Earl!

01:22.374 --> 01:24.417
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:28.547 --> 01:30.298
You dumb shit.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.635
I was in
a stampede once.

01:35.763 --> 01:39.307
Three hundred head
going hell-bent
for the horizon.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.350
Now, exactly
how many cows

01:41.435 --> 01:43.603
are required for
a stampede, Earl?

01:43.687 --> 01:44.937
l mean, is it like
three or more?

01:45.022 --> 01:47.106
ls there
a minimum speed?

01:47.191 --> 01:49.192
l wish a stampede
up your ass.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.601
No breakfast?

02:23.685 --> 02:26.562
l did it yesterday.
lt was bologna and beans.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.774
No. lt was eggs.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.568
l did eggs, over easy.

02:32.653 --> 02:33.986
The hell you did.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.572
Bologna and beans.
lt's your turn.

02:44.206 --> 02:47.875
Well, l guess
when l'm your age,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.127
l'll forget
what l eat, too.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.385
Oh, God damn it!

02:58.762 --> 03:01.472
l ask you, is this a job
for intelligent men?

03:01.557 --> 03:03.307
Show me one.
l'll ask him.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.310
l mean, if we were
real serious about money,

03:06.395 --> 03:07.645
we'd quit being
hired hands. . .

03:07.729 --> 03:10.731
Handymen, Earl.
We are handymen.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.526
Yeah, yeah.
We should quit
this job and

03:13.610 --> 03:15.695
find ourselves
some real employment.

03:15.779 --> 03:18.364
Are you gonna
give up all this
personal freedom?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.740
l don't know.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.214
Freeway!

03:35.841 --> 03:37.800
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

03:37.885 --> 03:38.968
lt's garbage day.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.679
Oh, man ! Already?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.973
Hey, what's Nestor
paying us?

03:44.558 --> 03:47.810
50 bucks.
And that's 47 bucks
more than we got.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.729
Burt and Heather's place
is closer.

03:49.813 --> 03:53.232
Let's do their linoleum today
and do the garbage tomorrow.

03:53.317 --> 03:54.567
Nestor's not home tomorrow.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.694
Now, look, we don't
dig today, we don't
get paid today.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.280
Now, damn it, Valentine,
you never plan ahead.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.406
You never take
the long view.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.035
l mean, here it is Monday,
and l'm already
thinking of Wednesday.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.996
lt is Monday, right?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.500
Hey,
who the hell's that?

04:11.585 --> 04:13.419
That's not what's-his-name,
the grad student?

04:13.503 --> 04:15.421
No. He graduated.
Must be the new one.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.923
The new one?

04:18.382 --> 04:20.384
That's supposed
to be a girl.

04:28.060 --> 04:30.937
You will have long,
blonde hair,

04:31.021 --> 04:34.106
big, green eyes,
world-class breasts,

04:34.191 --> 04:38.486
ass that won't quit
and legs that go
all the way up!

04:47.704 --> 04:50.957
Hi ! l'm Rhonda.
Rhonda LeBeck.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.458
l'm up here
for the semester.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.542
Yeah, geography.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.877
Geology.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.588
Yeah, well,
actually seismology.

04:57.673 --> 04:58.923
Earthquakes.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.883
And you two must
be Val and Earl.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.218
l've heard all about you.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.636
We deny everything.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.598
Hey, listen,
l've got a question for you.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.643
Do you know if anybody's
doing any drilling
or blasting

05:10.727 --> 05:12.311
or anything like that?

05:13.563 --> 05:16.148
Around here?
No, ma'am.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.069
Well, l'm supposed to monitor
the seismographs.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.656
You know,
they measure vibrations.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.825
Vibrations
in the ground.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.034
Yeah.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.830
Well, l've been getting
some really strange readings.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.082
l mean, the school's
had these machines
up here for three years,

05:33.166 --> 05:35.167
and we've never recorded
anything like this.

05:35.252 --> 05:38.838
Well, we'll ask around.
You know, see if
anyone's heard anything.

05:39.715 --> 05:40.840
Thanks.

05:41.258 --> 05:42.299
God, l hope
they're not broken.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.011
l might have to bag
the whole semester.

05:45.804 --> 05:48.222
Anyway, sorry to bother you.

05:48.306 --> 05:49.932
No problem.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.601
Nice meeting you.
Hope you get it
all sorted out.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.454
You know, if you wanted,
we could take a look at those

06:12.789 --> 06:14.790
seismographs for her
if you want.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.376
What the hell do we know
about seismographs?

06:17.461 --> 06:18.919
Nothing.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.921
lt sure might be
a slick way to
get to know her.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.131
Why?

06:22.799 --> 06:24.383
Damn it, Valentine.

06:24.468 --> 06:25.801
You don't go for any gal
unless she fits

06:25.886 --> 06:28.137
that stupid list of yours
from top to bottom.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.806
Well, sure!
Yeah, and it's dumber
than my hind end.

06:30.891 --> 06:34.143
l mean, like that
Bobby Lynn Dexter.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.729
Tammy Lynn Baxter.

06:36.813 --> 06:40.066
lt don't matter.
They're all the same,
dead weight.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.901
"Ooh ! l broke a nail !"

06:43.320 --> 06:45.029
Makes my skin crawl.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.698
Well, l'm a victim
of circumstance.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.535
l thought you call it
your pecker.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.277
Hey, pizza face!

07:25.946 --> 07:27.154
Melvin?

07:27.239 --> 07:30.032
Melvin ! You touch
that truck and die.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.661
Oh, man,
l'm really shaking.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.623
Thanks, Walter.

07:37.707 --> 07:38.874
Look, these are
hollow points,

07:38.959 --> 07:40.543
but they're not
Hydrashok hollow points.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.044
Excuse me, l thought
bullets were bullets.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.462
Hi, guys.
What you been doing?

07:43.547 --> 07:46.841
We ran into that
new college student,
that Rona.

07:46.925 --> 07:50.803
Rhonda. Yeah,
she's having trouble
with her, uh,

07:51.721 --> 07:53.139
uh, things.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.516
You know,
those college kids

07:55.600 --> 07:58.144
turn up oil or uranium
or something out there.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.354
Next thing the feds
will be at our door.

08:00.438 --> 08:04.024
"Sorry. Time to move.
Eminent domain."

08:04.109 --> 08:05.526
Down, honey. Down.

08:05.610 --> 08:08.279
Yeah, Burt.
The way you worry,

08:08.363 --> 08:11.949
you'll have a heart attack
before you get a chance
to survive World War lll.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.492
We'll see.
We'll see.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.165
Hey, guys, listen.
Bearing going out.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.916
What do you think?
Could be.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.669
Catch you later, Chang.
We got a schedule to keep.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.297
Oh, yeah.
See, we plan ahead.

08:26.381 --> 08:29.258
That way we don't do
anything right now.
Earl explained it to me.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.535
Cocktail?

10:19.619 --> 10:20.911
You bet.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.752
Well, l'll tell you.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.047
Nobody handles garbage
better than we do.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.215
Yep.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.554
Oh, come on, Earl.
Now this is low.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.057
We have got to set our sights
a little bit higher.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.897
Hey, Melvin,
why don't you
give us a hand?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.817
Most of this shit
is yours anyway.

10:51.901 --> 10:55.654
Listen, run down to the store
and pick me up a six-pack.
l'll pay for it.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.115
Son, beer is for adults.

11:00.702 --> 11:03.620
You know, not having a plan
is what keeps us
doing jobs like this.

11:03.705 --> 11:07.166
Just doing jobs like this
is you dragging your feet.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.668
Are you gonna stand
there and tell me,
in broad daylight,

11:09.753 --> 11:11.670
that l'm the reason
we're still in Perfection?

11:11.755 --> 11:14.381
You know how close l am
to leaving this place
right now?

11:14.466 --> 11:17.009
l'll call that
little bluff.
How close?

11:18.595 --> 11:20.512
Shit!
God damn !

11:22.223 --> 11:25.934
Jesus Christ!
God damn !

11:28.605 --> 11:30.356
Don't forget the TV.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.940
Hey, what's that
vacuum cleaner for, man?

11:32.025 --> 11:33.359
l like this
vacuum cleaner.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.985
Hell, you never use it.

11:35.070 --> 11:36.612
Well, it's good
for parts.

11:38.615 --> 11:40.157
And, besides,
maybe we'll
hire a maid.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.700
Now had you
thought about
that, Earl?

11:41.785 --> 11:43.202
Get in the truck.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.504
Guys!

11:56.007 --> 11:57.800
Hey, guys, wait!

12:01.137 --> 12:02.346
Hi.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.639
Sorry, Nancy.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.516
We're not delivering
firewood anymore.

12:05.600 --> 12:06.975
We're heading for
Bixby permanent.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.310
Oh, sure.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.480
Oh, my God.
You really are!

12:12.982 --> 12:15.567
Hey, Mindy,
what's the count?

12:15.652 --> 12:17.903
Six hundred and forty.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.655
Guys, look,
l don't need firewood.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.073
l have this big
order to fill,

12:21.157 --> 12:23.409
and l have to build
my new pottery kiln.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.745
Come on, it'll be at
least a month's work.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.622
l'll throw in lunches.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.083
And beer.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.842
l can't believe
we said no to free beer.

12:40.885 --> 12:44.388
We did it! We did it!
We faced temptation
and did not bend !

12:44.472 --> 12:46.265
God damn !
Praise the Lord !

12:47.183 --> 12:48.976
Now there's nothing,
and l mean nothing,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.103
between us and
Bixby but nothing !

12:52.188 --> 12:53.689
Yeah !
Yeah !

12:57.068 --> 12:58.527
Hey, look at that guy!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.362
Oh, that's one job
l'd never do.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.780
Working around
electricity.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.032
Hey, hold up.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.659
That's Edgar Deems.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.703
Come on.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.372
No. He only wears
that one damn jacket.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.374
That's him,
l'm telling you.

13:26.181 --> 13:28.765
Man, oh, man,
he sure must've
been drunk this time.

13:28.850 --> 13:31.185
Edgar, get your
butt down from there!

13:37.901 --> 13:39.985
Well, shit.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.737
We can't leave him
up there.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.123
Thank you, Edgar.

13:56.419 --> 13:59.588
You owe me on this one,
you damned old boozehound.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.263
One of these days,
you're gonna have to
get your ass

14:08.348 --> 14:10.015
on a wagon
and stay there.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.726
Jesus! lt's not like
l don't have
better things to do

14:12.810 --> 14:16.730
than to climb towers
and drag your
hairy ass down.

14:18.733 --> 14:20.275
Jesus Christ!

14:27.784 --> 14:29.993
Was it
a heart attack, Doctor?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.038
No.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.667
He died of dehydration.
Thirst.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.460
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.337
That takes a couple
of days, doesn't it?

14:40.421 --> 14:42.214
Maybe even three or four.

14:43.758 --> 14:46.093
You mean he sat up there
three or four days?

14:46.177 --> 14:48.554
He sat up there and
just died of thirst?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.198
Hmm.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.544
You reckon he
hated Perfection
more than us?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.130
Do you suppose
he wanted to
kill himself?

16:05.214 --> 16:08.091
Come on.
Somebody must've
chased him up there.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.553
What, you mean someone
who ain't scared of
a Winchester rifle?

16:12.388 --> 16:13.722
Then what'd they do?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.892
Camp out down below
and just wait
for him to die?

16:18.561 --> 16:20.062
What the hell?

16:35.370 --> 16:37.746
What the shit?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.166
Hey, Fred !

16:42.627 --> 16:44.294
Hey, there, old Fred !

16:45.922 --> 16:47.130
Hey, Fred !

16:51.094 --> 16:52.219
Fred !

17:03.606 --> 17:04.731
This is weird.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.566
This is real weird.

17:10.445 --> 17:11.738
Jesus!

17:11.823 --> 17:13.531
What the hell's
going on?

17:13.616 --> 17:15.951
l mean,
what the hell
is going on?

17:25.502 --> 17:26.795
Everybody get the hell
out of here!

17:26.878 --> 17:28.797
There's a killer
on the loose!

17:28.881 --> 17:30.882
What?
A murderer, man !
A real psycho!

17:30.967 --> 17:32.884
He's cutting
people's heads off.

17:32.969 --> 17:34.803
l'm not kidding !

17:35.513 --> 17:37.472
They're pulling
our chain.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.726
Yeah.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.162
What?

18:02.415 --> 18:03.665
Shit.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.005
Howard ! Howard !

18:12.341 --> 18:13.633
Carmine?

18:22.810 --> 18:24.186
Who could be doing it?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.979
l'm not accusing anybody.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.440
l'm just saying,
some of my cattle
are missing.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.317
Are you serious?
Old Fred's dead?

18:30.401 --> 18:31.610
Dude, something
like that.

18:31.694 --> 18:33.278
Come on, you're
bullshitting me,
right, pal?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.404
What happened to Fred?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.697
No worse than Edgar.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.783
What happened
to Edgar?
You won't believe it.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.534
Here, l need one
of those candy bars.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.328
l don't believe this.
The phone is dead.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.621
Walter, your phone
is dead !

18:42.705 --> 18:44.122
l didn't do it.

18:44.207 --> 18:46.458
Nestor,
what's happening?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.001
Somebody killed old Fred.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.628
What should we do?
What's going on?

18:49.712 --> 18:51.630
Now, look, Val,
you gotta get to Bixby,

18:51.714 --> 18:53.298
and you gotta get
the police up here.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.300
And you gotta step on it.

18:56.552 --> 18:58.470
Consider it stepped on.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.728
Man, we decided
to leave this place

19:06.813 --> 19:09.481
just one damn day
too late, you know?

19:10.358 --> 19:13.193
Well, there's sure as hell
nothing to stop us now.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.822
Everybody we know
between here and Bixby
is already dead.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.198
Look out!

19:23.746 --> 19:26.122
ls there some higher
force at work here?

19:28.167 --> 19:30.502
l mean, are we asking
too much of life?

19:30.586 --> 19:33.296
Where the hell
are these guys?

19:33.381 --> 19:35.757
What are they doing?
Blasting?

19:35.842 --> 19:37.008
Hey!

19:37.844 --> 19:41.429
Where are you guys?
lt's not like there's
another road, asshole!

19:44.392 --> 19:46.101
Val ! Val !

20:11.127 --> 20:12.878
Jesus!
l don't believe this!

20:12.962 --> 20:14.379
You're hung up.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.673
l am not!

20:20.011 --> 20:22.470
You're hung up,
l tell you !

20:22.555 --> 20:24.556
You're gonna burn
the clutch !

20:34.483 --> 20:36.067
You know, you could
break an axle like that.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.028
Could you shut up?

20:38.112 --> 20:40.780
Hey, l don't need
to spend the night
out here.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.828
Crybaby.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.247
-Could it have been coyotes?
-No way.

20:49.332 --> 20:51.291
No.
Coyotes didn't kill Fred.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.585
Hey, it's Val and Earl.

20:55.004 --> 20:57.172
They shouldn't
be here already.

20:59.175 --> 21:00.592
Thought you two
were in Bixby by now.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.927
You are never
gonna believe this.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.428
Mom !

21:03.512 --> 21:04.846
Oh, my God !

21:09.352 --> 21:11.102
Oh, Burt, be careful.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.479
Unreal.

21:12.688 --> 21:14.105
Where'd you get it?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.523
l didn't know
we had it.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.691
lt's disgusting.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.817
Some kind of snake?

21:17.902 --> 21:20.445
Looks more like
an eel to me.

21:20.529 --> 21:23.114
Eels live in the water,
don't they?

21:23.199 --> 21:24.532
Big mother slug, maybe.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.867
Don't touch !

21:25.952 --> 21:28.703
Relax. lt's dead.

21:45.346 --> 21:47.889
Hey, it must've grabbed us!
That's why the truck
stalled out.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.349
Next time l tell you
l'm not hung up. . .

21:49.433 --> 21:51.935
Hey, wait.
This stalled out your truck?

21:53.229 --> 21:55.772
lt'd have to be one
strong son of a bitch.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.066
Stinks, too.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.902
l'll give you boys
$5 for this.

22:03.114 --> 22:04.489
$20.

22:04.573 --> 22:05.657
Okay, $10!

22:05.741 --> 22:06.992
$15.

22:08.452 --> 22:10.078
Okay, $15.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.538
Damn right, $15.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.665
l don't believe you guys.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.543
Could be a snake!

22:17.962 --> 22:19.629
Some kind of mutation.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.756
Yeah.

22:24.885 --> 22:26.302
Whatever it is,

22:28.097 --> 22:31.808
just one of these
couldn't eat up Fred
and his whole flock of sheep.

22:31.892 --> 22:34.602
So you think
there are more
of them out there?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.786
l'm dead. Let's put this
stuff up in the morning.

22:52.663 --> 22:53.788
No.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.167
We have to go to Bixby
in the morning.

22:57.835 --> 22:58.918
The cinder blocks are in.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.378
Oh, the cinder blocks.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.589
Oh, my God !

23:02.673 --> 23:05.675
Just keep looking
at that beautiful sky.

23:05.760 --> 23:09.387
That's the sky that's gonna
be over our roof every night
when we're done.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.515
What if we don't
finish the roof?

23:12.600 --> 23:15.435
Then we can
look at the sky
all the time. Huh?

23:18.189 --> 23:19.981
Oh, that damn thing.

23:28.866 --> 23:31.659
Maybe it's time
we buy a new
generator, huh?

23:38.834 --> 23:40.001
lt's gone!

23:40.086 --> 23:42.045
What do you mean,
it's gone?

23:46.801 --> 23:48.718
You sure this is
where it was?

23:48.803 --> 23:51.596
lt was right here!
There's the cord.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.931
Hold this.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.273
Yeah, maybe the
ground caved in.

24:02.358 --> 24:04.400
There's a lot of mines
and stuff around here.

24:04.485 --> 24:07.695
Well, don't then.
You don't wanna fall in.

24:15.579 --> 24:16.704
Let's go.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.374
God, what is that stink?

24:22.336 --> 24:23.545
You hear that?

24:26.215 --> 24:28.716
Come on. Come on,
let's just go.

24:28.801 --> 24:32.637
Let's go back to
town or something.
Please, Jim !

24:32.721 --> 24:37.058
Maybe it's a geological
thing or something like
natural gas or a geyser.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.560
They stink like that.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.228
Remember in Yellowstone?

24:41.230 --> 24:43.022
Jim !
Something's got me!

24:44.233 --> 24:46.276
No, Jim, no!

24:46.902 --> 24:48.987
Something's got me
down here!

24:50.614 --> 24:52.323
Oh, Jim !

24:52.408 --> 24:55.034
Oh, God ! Oh, God !

24:55.119 --> 24:58.246
Get something !
Get something !
Get me out of here!

25:04.003 --> 25:05.503
Jim !

25:05.588 --> 25:06.880
Something's got me.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.215
Oh, God !
Please get me out!

25:11.927 --> 25:13.219
Help me!

25:15.681 --> 25:16.848
Jim !

25:37.745 --> 25:39.120
Oh, my God.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.139
Mindy, smile.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.683
Come on, honey.
Don't look so afraid.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.351
lt's not gonna hurt you.
l promise.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.395
Mindy, look up. Smile.
Come on.

26:45.479 --> 26:46.646
Hold it.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.816
Melvin, get out of there!

26:51.735 --> 26:54.320
Old Chang, slick as snot,
and l ain't lying.

26:54.405 --> 26:56.489
15 lousy bucks.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.200
A man who plans ahead. . .

26:59.868 --> 27:04.914
Look, we arm ourselves,
we set perimeters,
we stand guard.

27:06.000 --> 27:09.460
Any of those snake
things show up here,
we make them extinct.

27:09.545 --> 27:10.545
All right!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.130
Come on, Burt,
get serious.

27:12.214 --> 27:14.632
Yeah ! You make it
sound like a war.

27:14.717 --> 27:16.634
What have you people
got against being prepared?

27:16.719 --> 27:17.969
Where's the sugar?
Rambo.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.971
Wait a minute.
Walter's got a CB radio.

27:20.055 --> 27:22.348
Why aren't you calling
somebody in Bixby?
The police. . .

27:22.433 --> 27:25.935
No. We can't reach
outside the valley
because of the mountains.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.563
Melvin, you're next.
Come on. Sit down,
look scared.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.064
-Okay.
-Yeah.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.943
The phone's out.
The road's out.
We're on our own.

27:34.028 --> 27:36.154
You two are just
loving it, aren't you?

27:36.238 --> 27:38.406
Come on, Nancy.
Let's don't get personal
about this thing !

27:38.490 --> 27:39.657
We gotta do something.

27:39.742 --> 27:40.950
Hell, yes!

27:41.660 --> 27:43.661
We are completely
cut off.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.080
We got the cliffs
to the north.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.541
Mountains to the east
and the west.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.878
That's why Heather
and me settled here
in the first place.

27:51.962 --> 27:53.880
Geographic isolation.

27:53.964 --> 27:56.174
Well, there's gotta be
some way we can get help.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.426
For God's sake,
this isn't the moon !

27:58.510 --> 28:01.095
What are you gonna do,
walk the 38 miles to Bixby?

28:03.724 --> 28:06.517
Hey, there's
Walter's saddle horses.

28:06.602 --> 28:09.103
That's it.
You're welcome to them.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.981
Somebody could
ride to Bixby.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.651
That's not bad.
That's not bad.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.403
Who's best on a horse?

28:28.165 --> 28:30.124
Walter, they
better be fast.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.211
We don't wanna be stuck
on a couple of canners.

28:33.295 --> 28:35.254
Those snake things
couldn't travel that fast.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.590
Shit, for all you know,
they could fly.

28:37.674 --> 28:41.177
Here, what do you want?
This colt or
Edgar's old rifle?

28:41.261 --> 28:42.470
Rifle.

28:47.768 --> 28:50.395
Hey, Earl.
Here's some Swiss cheese
and some bullets.

28:50.479 --> 28:51.813
Thanks, Walter.

28:57.611 --> 28:58.778
You guys all set?

28:58.862 --> 29:00.738
Well, ready as
we'll ever be.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.073
Heather and l are
gonna drive around.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.491
We'll see if we can
find that college girl,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.326
tell her to get her
ass back into town.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.328
Good idea. We'll swing
by the doctor's place

29:07.413 --> 29:09.455
and see if they went
into Bixby or not.

29:09.540 --> 29:10.873
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

29:10.958 --> 29:11.958
Y'all gonna have
to take something

29:12.042 --> 29:14.043
that packs more of
a punch than that 30-30.

29:14.128 --> 29:17.088
Why don't you take
one of our Browning Autos?

29:17.172 --> 29:19.799
Or better than that,
why don't you just
take my Model 70?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.385
lt's .375 H&H mag.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.928
Thanks, Heather.

29:24.555 --> 29:25.847
Well, l hope we
don't need to use it.

29:27.683 --> 29:31.018
lt's got me!

29:33.313 --> 29:35.106
-Melvin !
-Grow up!

29:35.190 --> 29:36.858
Damn it, Melvin !

29:38.193 --> 29:39.318
He's only kidding.

29:39.403 --> 29:40.945
You came that close.

29:42.030 --> 29:43.281
Too close.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.740
No more games.

29:46.910 --> 29:50.538
Melvin, one of these days
somebody's gonna
kick your ass.

30:30.204 --> 30:31.287
Doctor?

30:50.265 --> 30:52.183
Man, l hate
this shit.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.228
Wait a minute.

30:56.730 --> 30:59.524
The car's gone.
We just missed them,
that's all.

31:01.985 --> 31:05.196
Where the hell's
the goddamn golden
oldie coming from?

31:20.212 --> 31:21.379
What the hell's this?

31:21.463 --> 31:22.630
You got me.

31:33.058 --> 31:37.061
Okay, here's the plan.
We don't even stop.
We ride like hell.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.064
Tonight we'll
keep right on going.
We'll walk the horses.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.482
That is the plan.

31:41.567 --> 31:44.902
l mean, God damn,
what the hell
are those things?

31:44.987 --> 31:46.904
And how could they bury
a whole station wagon?

31:46.989 --> 31:48.698
Why would they do it?

31:52.244 --> 31:54.829
Come on, boy!
Come on, git, git!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.664
Walter wouldn't know
a decent horse

31:56.748 --> 31:58.457
if it came up and
bit him in the ass.

31:58.542 --> 32:01.836
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
They got wind of something
they don't like.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.045
Git.

32:06.883 --> 32:08.301
Something's
going on here.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.636
l don't see
anything anywhere!

32:20.480 --> 32:22.773
Hey! Hey, you okay?

32:22.858 --> 32:24.859
Yeah, yeah.
What about my horse?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.571
What in the name of. . .

32:33.493 --> 32:35.119
That's how
they get you.

32:35.203 --> 32:37.121
They're under
the goddamn ground.

32:38.498 --> 32:40.082
Well, what the hell
are they?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.917
Sons of bitches!

32:54.723 --> 32:56.182
Must be a million
of them !

32:58.143 --> 32:59.602
Nope. Just one.

33:04.775 --> 33:06.067
Come on.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.299
He's gaining on us!

33:32.135 --> 33:33.260
Look!

33:36.598 --> 33:38.933
We can make it!
We can make it!

33:50.946 --> 33:52.530
Stupid son of a bitch.

33:53.615 --> 33:55.449
lt knocked itself cold.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.953
Cold, my ass!

34:00.122 --> 34:01.455
He's dead.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.167
We killed it.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.670
We killed it!

34:08.755 --> 34:10.630
Fuck you !

34:14.428 --> 34:16.429
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

34:17.514 --> 34:19.849
Did you notice
anything weird
a minute ago?

34:19.933 --> 34:21.641
l mean, it just. . .

34:26.148 --> 34:27.398
What's that?

34:27.858 --> 34:31.152
All right, together.
One, two, three.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.742
Jesus Christ!

34:38.659 --> 34:41.245
Does it smell like that
'cause it's dead?

34:55.177 --> 34:56.844
l don't see any eyes.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.764
Must be totally subterranean.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.351
And those tentacles.

35:04.436 --> 35:05.519
Yeah.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.982
You know, l think
they shoot right
out of its mouth,

35:10.859 --> 35:13.903
and they hook you
and pull you right in.

35:14.488 --> 35:17.072
Good thing
we stopped it before
it killed anybody else.

35:17.157 --> 35:20.117
Look, this is important,
you know.

35:20.202 --> 35:21.660
This is like. . .

35:21.745 --> 35:23.579
Well, let's just say it.

35:23.663 --> 35:27.458
This is probably
the biggest zoological
discovery of the century.

35:27.542 --> 35:29.919
Hey!
Hey, check this out.

35:33.215 --> 35:34.965
l found the ass end.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.886
Jesus, we really
caught something here.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.560
Wow!
Man !

35:47.437 --> 35:49.313
That's one big mother.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.442
This must be the old boy
had your seismos
working overtime.

35:53.527 --> 35:54.610
Yeah.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.824
Yeah, it must push
itself along with these.

35:59.908 --> 36:01.867
All of them
pushing at once.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.412
That's why it
moved so fast.

36:05.914 --> 36:10.042
l mean, this thing
had sensors tripping
all over the place. No. . .

36:10.126 --> 36:12.628
Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard
of anything like this before?

36:12.712 --> 36:14.588
Oh, sure, Earl.
Everybody knows
about them.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.173
We just didn't tell you.

36:16.258 --> 36:19.051
Oh, hell, man,
no one ever saw
anything like this!

36:19.135 --> 36:21.136
We're really
onto something here.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.555
l'll tell you
one damn thing,

36:22.639 --> 36:26.392
old Chang don't get
his slick mitts on this
for no measly 1 5 bucks.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.102
You got that right.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.771
All right,
here's the plan.
We need a flatbed.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.064
Yeah, right,
with a winch.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.858
Yeah, five-ton maybe.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.442
No, no, no,
don't wanna winch it.

36:35.527 --> 36:36.819
Don't wanna winch it.
lt'd tear it all up.

36:36.903 --> 36:37.903
All right, a crane?

36:37.988 --> 36:39.530
Yeah, a crane
with lifting straps.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.156
Hey. Hey, shut up.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.118
The way l figure it,
there are three more
of these things.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.327
What?

36:46.580 --> 36:47.621
Three more?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.290
l've got seismographs
all over this valley.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.916
Now if you compare
the different readings.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.960
Here's one at
2:00 yesterday.

36:53.044 --> 36:54.461
But here's one
three miles away

36:54.546 --> 36:56.130
at the exact same time.
Now that's two.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.173
But here. . .
Yeah, yeah. We'll take
your word for it.

36:58.258 --> 37:00.009
Yeah, where's
your truck?

37:00.093 --> 37:01.468
Just beyond that hill.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.560
What? What?

37:13.648 --> 37:15.566
Damn prairie
dog burrow.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.818
Little sons
of bitches.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.077
Psst! Psst!

37:30.749 --> 37:31.999
This way!

37:35.045 --> 37:36.670
Up on that rock!

37:50.977 --> 37:52.895
Looks like the one
that grabbed our truck.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.063
Where the hell's
your truck?

37:54.147 --> 37:56.273
lt's right over there.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.859
Oh, man,
l don't think
we can make that.

38:01.071 --> 38:02.947
At least he can't climb.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.119
Oh, man !

38:10.163 --> 38:12.790
Live ones smell
worse than the dead ones.

38:17.087 --> 38:18.545
Phew!

38:31.935 --> 38:33.644
l got it. l got it.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.188
They're mutations
caused by radiation.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.107
Or no, no, no.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.733
The government built them.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.986
Big surprise
for the Russians.

38:42.070 --> 38:45.906
Well, there's
nothing like them in the
fossil record. l'm sure.

38:46.616 --> 38:50.327
Okay, so they predate
the fossil record.

38:51.871 --> 38:54.790
That would make them
a couple billion years old.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.835
And we've just
never seen one
till now.

38:57.919 --> 38:59.128
Right.

38:59.212 --> 39:02.756
l vote for outer space.
No way these are local boys.

39:07.262 --> 39:10.264
Well, haven't seen
a sign for hours.

39:12.642 --> 39:14.184
Must be long gone.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.769
Yeah, must be.

39:17.105 --> 39:20.274
Hey, why don't you
take a little stroll
and find out?

39:23.737 --> 39:25.612
We gotta do something.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.083
"We gotta do something."

39:38.168 --> 39:42.004
l don't know why "we"
always has to be "me"
every damn time.

39:42.088 --> 39:46.341
We, we, we.
What do l look like?
An expert on worms?

39:46.426 --> 39:48.719
Watch it, Valentine,
it's got a good
six-foot reach.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.179
Thank you, Earl.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.060
Son of a bitch !

39:56.144 --> 39:58.062
Son of a goddamn bitch !

39:58.813 --> 40:00.856
Pardon my French.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.776
Shit! lt's been
waiting here
all this time?

40:03.860 --> 40:06.195
l mean, how's it know
we're still here?

40:07.655 --> 40:09.073
Well, it's got
no eyes, right?

40:09.157 --> 40:11.241
Sure as hell can't
smell us underground.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.118
l say it's
been listening.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.079
Of course!

40:15.163 --> 40:17.748
lt senses
seismic vibration.

40:17.832 --> 40:19.333
lt can hear
every move we make,

40:19.417 --> 40:22.252
especially on this rock,
it's a perfect conductor.

40:22.337 --> 40:25.005
That means we're stuck.
That pisses me off!

40:34.849 --> 40:39.103
Well, l hate to be
crude, but l gotta take
care of some business.

40:39.187 --> 40:41.188
-Me, too.
-Same here.

41:10.510 --> 41:11.718
Thanks.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.430
No problem. Anytime.

41:27.527 --> 41:29.820
Well, what's the plan?

41:29.904 --> 41:32.322
l think the first
thing we gotta do

41:32.407 --> 41:34.533
is see if old stumpy's
still out there.

41:36.744 --> 41:38.162
Can l borrow
that shovel?

41:38.246 --> 41:39.371
Yeah.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.382
Doesn't he have
a home to go to?

41:50.466 --> 41:53.177
That's why Edgar
never got down
off that damn tower.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.428
l think
l have an idea.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.929
You know,

41:56.014 --> 41:57.848
we're gonna have to
come up with
some sort of plan,

41:57.932 --> 41:59.057
he's just gonna
wait us to death.

41:59.100 --> 42:00.893
Yeah, well, l was. . .
Why don't we just
make a run for it?

42:00.977 --> 42:02.519
We outran him yesterday.

42:02.604 --> 42:04.521
Run for it?
Running's not a plan.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.648
Now running's what you do
when a plan fails.

42:06.733 --> 42:08.859
Valentine, you're not
even trying to think
of a plan.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.069
Well, it ain't like
we got a hell of
a lot of options.

42:11.154 --> 42:14.364
There's always options.
We just gotta think
of them, that's all.

42:14.449 --> 42:16.450
All right, well,
why don't you
start thinking?

42:16.534 --> 42:18.952
Why in the hell
do l always have to
do all the thinking?

42:19.037 --> 42:20.871
Who died and
made you Einstein?

42:20.955 --> 42:22.664
You guys know
how to pole vault?

42:28.254 --> 42:30.797
We just stay
where he can't get us,

42:31.633 --> 42:33.383
on these
residual boulders.

42:33.468 --> 42:35.886
My truck's parked
right next to one.

42:48.024 --> 42:50.317
Stay on those
residual boulders!

42:52.278 --> 42:56.323
That Tammy Lynn Baxter,
she do much pole vaulting?

43:02.413 --> 43:03.997
Shit!

43:19.180 --> 43:20.722
That's pretty good.

43:41.244 --> 43:44.288
That slimebag ain't
gonna give us much time
once we hit that truck.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.580
l say we all
jump together.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.124
Right.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.417
Wait.

43:50.962 --> 43:52.629
Okay, ready.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.882
One, two, three!

44:03.683 --> 44:05.392
Go! Go! Go! Go!

44:08.730 --> 44:10.105
Watch it, Val !

44:13.568 --> 44:15.068
Move! Move!

44:26.581 --> 44:29.249
Could somebody,
perhaps, help me?

44:30.293 --> 44:32.336
Burt! Heather!
No! No! No!

44:32.420 --> 44:35.005
The snake things are
just their tongues
or something.

44:35.089 --> 44:36.715
These animals are huge!

44:36.799 --> 44:40.719
l'm sorry. l'm having
a real difficult time
with this.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.679
Come on,
you guys, answer.

44:42.764 --> 44:44.056
Come back.
Hey, Walter.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.307
Where's Burt and Heather?

44:45.391 --> 44:46.933
l can't reach them.

44:48.061 --> 44:50.103
l guess they're still
driving around somewhere.

44:50.188 --> 44:52.981
Hey, Rhonda,
what's the name
you call those things?

44:53.066 --> 44:54.941
Where do they
come from?
Huh?

44:55.777 --> 44:56.902
l don't know.

44:56.986 --> 44:58.320
You're a scientist,
aren't you?

44:58.404 --> 45:01.531
Yeah, aren't you
supposed to have
a theory or something?

45:01.616 --> 45:04.201
Look, these creatures
are absolutely unprecedented.

45:04.285 --> 45:06.411
Yeah. But where do
they come from?

45:06.496 --> 45:07.621
Yeah !

45:09.499 --> 45:12.292
lt doesn't matter
where they come from.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.586
No name? Ha!

45:14.962 --> 45:17.631
We discovered them,
we should name them !

45:17.715 --> 45:20.258
Walter, forget
the damn name!

45:21.427 --> 45:23.845
Now me and Earl think
we better get the hell
out of this valley.

45:23.930 --> 45:26.139
Hang on, Val.
Let's not go off
half-cocked.

45:26.224 --> 45:28.475
Yeah. Well,
somebody's bound
to come check on us,

45:28.559 --> 45:32.020
once they see
the road is out
and the lines are down.

45:32.105 --> 45:33.522
Yeah, that's
how it works.

45:54.585 --> 45:56.962
Or "suckoids." "Oids."

45:57.046 --> 45:59.714
Oids. l like snakeoids.

45:59.799 --> 46:03.593
One of them comes near me,
and l'll just hit him
with a five-pound pickax.

46:03.678 --> 46:05.095
No. You don't
understand, Nestor.

46:05.179 --> 46:07.264
They come up from
underneath the ground
and they grab you.

46:07.348 --> 46:09.766
They sense the
slightest vibration
through the ground.

46:09.851 --> 46:12.727
Even footsteps.
That's how they hunt.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.772
Hey, so like we don't
vibrate, right?

46:17.024 --> 46:19.443
Maybe they won't even
come through here.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.611
Maybe they'll
leave us alone!

46:21.696 --> 46:23.864
Chain saw.
That's what l'll use.

46:23.948 --> 46:25.866
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Wake up!

46:26.534 --> 46:27.868
Now, look!

46:33.040 --> 46:35.208
You see, they're
headed right for us.

46:35.293 --> 46:36.793
Look, they trapped
Edgar here.

46:36.878 --> 46:38.295
Grabbed old Fred
right here.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.130
Nailed those two poor
suckers on the road,

46:40.214 --> 46:42.549
and the doctor's place
is right here!

46:42.633 --> 46:46.011
Now this valley is just
one long smorgasbord.

46:46.095 --> 46:48.638
We have got to get out.

46:52.185 --> 46:53.685
l'm gonna
go get Mindy.

46:53.769 --> 46:56.855
Oh, she's okay.
l saw her playing
down the street.

46:56.939 --> 47:01.151
That's what l like,
"Graboids"!
That's it, graboids!

47:01.235 --> 47:02.903
Jesus, Walter.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.780
We're gonna be sorry
if we don't give it a name.

47:05.865 --> 47:07.991
Okay, Val, you say
let's get out of here.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.368
So where are we
supposed to go?

47:10.453 --> 47:13.371
Well, Rhonda's got
an idea about that.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.876
Yeah, see, they move
very easily through the
Pleistocene alluvials.

47:20.671 --> 47:21.838
The dirt.

47:21.923 --> 47:24.132
The loose soil
that covers
the valley floor.

47:24.217 --> 47:26.176
But they can't
move through rock.

47:26.260 --> 47:28.178
So l think we
should head west
to the mountains.

47:28.262 --> 47:29.846
She means up
the old jeep trail.

47:29.931 --> 47:32.349
lf those mountains
are solid granite,
we'd be safe there.

47:32.433 --> 47:34.142
And we could hike along them
all the way to Bixby if we. . .

47:37.813 --> 47:39.606
l scared you, didn't l?

47:41.108 --> 47:42.859
You little ass wipe.

47:42.944 --> 47:46.279
You don't knock it off,
you're gonna be
shitting this basketball.

47:49.158 --> 47:50.325
Pardon my French.

47:53.788 --> 47:58.500
Mindy!

48:01.045 --> 48:03.838
lt's gonna take us
days to get back with help
with Nestor.

48:03.923 --> 48:06.216
We're not gonna
leave you alone.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.055
Damn it!
l'm gonna kick his ass!

48:12.139 --> 48:13.682
l'm gonna help you.

48:15.935 --> 48:17.143
Melvin !

48:17.853 --> 48:20.146
Where is that
little shit stain?

48:25.152 --> 48:26.903
Melvin, get your. . .

48:30.241 --> 48:32.158
Get inside!
Get inside!

48:45.840 --> 48:47.424
Run ! Come on !

48:47.508 --> 48:49.175
Come on, get in !

48:49.969 --> 48:52.971
Jesus Christ, Walter,
you got a gun?

48:53.055 --> 48:55.599
No! What are we gonna do?

48:55.683 --> 48:57.559
Be quiet, quiet, quiet!

48:59.353 --> 49:00.520
Where is he?

49:20.166 --> 49:24.961
Now remember,
no noise, no vibrations.

49:35.264 --> 49:36.973
Oh, no, Mindy.

49:37.058 --> 49:38.224
Stop, stop.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.310
Mindy, get off
the pogo stick.

49:43.564 --> 49:44.731
Mindy!

49:44.815 --> 49:46.483
Get her, Val !
Mindy, come back!

49:46.567 --> 49:47.734
Mindy!

49:50.905 --> 49:51.905
Oh !

49:57.745 --> 49:58.995
Mindy.

49:59.080 --> 50:00.872
Quiet. Quiet.
Don't move.

50:04.919 --> 50:06.920
Mindy, get back.
Get back.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.298
Run !
Get in the house!

50:19.183 --> 50:22.060
We gotta get him off.
lt'll suck that truck down.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.438
Go back for Christ's sake!

50:27.817 --> 50:29.984
Jesus, here comes
another one!

50:31.696 --> 50:33.571
Run ! Come on ! Come on !

51:29.837 --> 51:31.671
Get out of your pants!

51:38.387 --> 51:39.512
Look out!

51:52.610 --> 51:53.693
Run !

51:57.990 --> 52:01.201
Run ! Don't look back.
Come on ! Come on !

52:17.092 --> 52:18.301
Sorry.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.492
Rhonda, here.

52:42.576 --> 52:43.910
Oh, thank you.

52:44.245 --> 52:46.538
So, what are
we gonna do?

52:46.956 --> 52:49.958
You know, how long
till they go away?

52:50.459 --> 52:52.502
They got
the patience of Job.

52:53.254 --> 52:57.340
They sit and goddamn wait
till they hear something
that sounds like lunch.

52:57.424 --> 52:58.466
We gotta have a plan.

52:58.551 --> 53:00.093
l got a plan.

53:00.177 --> 53:02.512
You and Val
drive the truck
up to the mountain,

53:02.596 --> 53:04.013
walk to Bixby,
get some help.

53:04.098 --> 53:07.642
Walter, those
scumsuckers
ate our radials.

53:07.726 --> 53:09.602
Well, you can
take my truck.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.437
No, we need a major
four-wheel drive

53:11.522 --> 53:13.189
just to get up
that jeep trail.

53:13.274 --> 53:15.817
That trail's
all messed up.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.947
Turn it off.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.909
Pull it back.
Pull it back.

53:29.623 --> 53:31.040
l got it.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.054
Give me your hand !
Give me your hand !

53:56.191 --> 53:57.817
Son of a bitch.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.778
Son of a bitch !

54:16.879 --> 54:18.963
Come on, let's go!
The roof!

54:39.568 --> 54:40.818
Come on !

54:46.450 --> 54:48.034
Jump, Rho!
You can do it!

54:48.118 --> 54:49.702
No, l can't! l can't!

54:53.666 --> 54:57.043
Rhonda! Don't stop.
Keep moving !

55:01.757 --> 55:03.299
Oh, my God.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.093
Hey!

55:10.975 --> 55:12.225
You okay?

55:14.436 --> 55:17.605
Hey, what's going on?
Where are you guys?

55:18.315 --> 55:20.483
What's up, man?
What the hell are
you doing up there?

55:20.567 --> 55:23.611
Melvin, shut
the hell up.

55:23.696 --> 55:25.571
Get up on your roof.
No way!

55:43.757 --> 55:46.926
Nestor?

55:48.178 --> 55:50.763
Nancy, get up
on your roofs.

55:50.848 --> 55:53.975
Up on your roofs!
They come through
the floor!

56:06.155 --> 56:08.614
l don't know.
l can't believe it.

56:09.616 --> 56:10.908
No tracks.

56:11.744 --> 56:13.619
No sign. No spoor.

56:14.997 --> 56:16.164
You'd think after
eating all those sheep

56:16.248 --> 56:18.833
they'd have to
take a dump someplace.

56:18.917 --> 56:21.085
Yeah. l don't
understand it.

56:41.648 --> 56:44.358
Yo, Walter.
This is Burt. Come back.

56:47.029 --> 56:49.155
Walter? Anybody copy?

56:51.325 --> 56:52.784
l'm waiting.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.119
Walter, you there?
Come back!

56:55.204 --> 56:56.704
Okay, l got it.

57:05.964 --> 57:08.716
Yo, who's minding the store,
for God's sake?

57:08.801 --> 57:12.678
Burt, listen.
We found out what's
been killing people.

57:12.763 --> 57:14.722
Say "over."
Over.

57:14.807 --> 57:18.142
Negative copy
on that, Walter.
Check your frequency.

57:19.561 --> 57:21.771
l'm on 22. Come back.

57:21.855 --> 57:24.357
Burt, can you
hear me now? Over.

57:25.109 --> 57:27.235
Val, is that you?
What're you doing
back already?

57:27.319 --> 57:29.570
Hey, Burt,
something real weird
is going on over there.

57:29.655 --> 57:31.447
They're up on
top of the roof.

57:47.422 --> 57:50.049
Hey, l think they're
going for Burt's.

57:53.846 --> 57:56.055
Oh, man,
they're going !

57:56.723 --> 58:00.101
Burt, get out
of your basement.
Take your radio.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.019
You and Heather
get up on your roof.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.813
We'll talk later.
Okay? Over.

58:03.897 --> 58:06.149
Up on the roof?
Val, what are you
talking about?

58:06.233 --> 58:09.443
Damn it, Burt.
Just listen to him.
Something's wrong.

58:09.903 --> 58:11.529
Burt, Jesus Christ!

58:11.613 --> 58:13.823
Get up on your roof!
The things!

58:13.907 --> 58:15.366
They're under the ground.

58:15.450 --> 58:16.993
They're bigger
than we thought.
They're huge.

58:17.077 --> 58:20.037
They're coming
right after you guys.
They're coming right now!

58:37.431 --> 58:39.307
We don't see
anything, Val.

58:39.391 --> 58:41.017
What the hell are you
talking about? Over.

58:41.101 --> 58:44.604
Burt, they're
under the ground.
They're under the ground.

58:44.688 --> 58:46.147
They can dig like
a son of a bitch.

58:46.231 --> 58:48.399
Big monsters!
Underground!
Now get out!

58:48.483 --> 58:49.734
Hurry!

59:11.131 --> 59:12.215
Jesus Christ!

59:52.339 --> 59:53.839
Burt, come on.

01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.934
Magazine!
Here!

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.457
Here!

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.674
Broke into the wrong
goddamn rec room
didn't you, you bastard?

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.638
We killed it! You got that?
We killed that motherhumper!
Come back.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:29.352
Well, roger that, Burt.
And congratulations.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:31.479
Be advised, however,
there are two more.

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.564
Repeat, two more
motherhumpers.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.287
Burt got one!
He killed one!

01:01:48.372 --> 01:01:50.456
Way to go, dude!

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:51.874
All right!

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.337
Yes! Yes!

01:01:57.172 --> 01:02:00.841
Well, l guess we don't
get to make fun of Burt's
lifestyle anymore, huh?

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:02.051
Say, Burt?

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:04.720
Any chance you can
get the other two?
Come back.

01:02:04.805 --> 01:02:07.056
Yeah. One second, pal.

01:02:16.358 --> 01:02:19.276
You didn't get penetration
even with the elephant gun.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.486
Shit!

01:02:21.321 --> 01:02:22.696
Good Lord !

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.538
Val, we can't get them.

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:33.707
l never figured on
having to shoot
through dirt.

01:02:33.792 --> 01:02:36.669
The best goddamn
bullet stop there is.
Come back.

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.880
Let me see that.

01:02:40.841 --> 01:02:42.758
Burt, listen.
Forget shooting them.

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:44.760
Tell me this.
Can you get
to your truck?

01:02:44.845 --> 01:02:46.095
Over.
No problem.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:47.638
Good, 'cause you have the
only truck in the valley

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:49.098
that can get up
that jeep trail.

01:02:49.182 --> 01:02:51.142
Now listen.
Here's the plan.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.102
You and Heather
go for help.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.437
You get to the mountains
and keep going. . .

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:56.981
Guys! You guys!

01:02:57.065 --> 01:02:58.816
Come over.
Hang on a sec.

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:01.694
He's up to something.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:04.321
Well, if it isn't our
old pal, stumpy.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:05.573
Bastard.

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:16.959
Hey, Rhonda.
What do you think
it's trying to do now?

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.128
Why do you keep asking me?

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.766
What the. . .

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:42.401
Gee! Wow.

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:46.906
What the hell was that?

01:03:46.990 --> 01:03:50.826
Breaker there, Earl.
What did you want us to do?
Come back.

01:03:52.037 --> 01:03:55.206
Hang on, Burt.
This bastard's
trying something new.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:57.791
Over.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:16.185
They wasn't
making no noise.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.145
Why is he
bothering them for?

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:21.524
Well, it's like it's
studying the buildings,
trying to figure them out.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:24.693
They can feel our vibrations
but they can't find us.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:27.571
Looks to me like
they're coming up
with a plan.

01:04:34.329 --> 01:04:35.955
Watch it, Nestor!

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:43.170
Jesus!

01:04:48.301 --> 01:04:49.969
Shit! Enough !

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.270
Get off the ground,
Nestor! Get moving !

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:01.355
Get out of there!
Get off the ground !

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.107
Move it! Move it!

01:05:04.818 --> 01:05:06.402
No, Nestor.
That's no good.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:08.153
Come on,
you gotta get higher.

01:05:19.499 --> 01:05:21.375
No way! No way, man !

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:25.004
No! You guys
gotta do something !

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:28.507
You gotta do something !

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:34.430
Burt, Heather?

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.977
Yeah, you got us, Val.
Come on back. Over.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:42.271
Listen, we're in
deep shit over here.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:44.106
We'll have to
change that plan.

01:05:46.818 --> 01:05:47.985
Burt, cut it out!

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.570
l think l scared him.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:51.363
No use going for help.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.450
We'd be dead long before
you'd ever get back.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.329
Okay, Val, we're with you.
Just tell us what
you wanna do. Over.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:01.790
Yeah, well, this one's
gonna tear this town
out from under us.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:04.460
We're all gonna
have to get out of
here together, now.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:05.669
Okay, Val.

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:08.881
We're coming after everybody.
Just hang tight. Over.

01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:10.883
Look.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.950
Val, you're gonna have to
forget about the truck.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:38.744
Yeah, we got you, Heather.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:44.083
Now, look.
The situation
hasn't changed.

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:47.461
We still have to
make it to solid rock.
There's gotta be some way.

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:48.587
Like what?

01:06:48.672 --> 01:06:51.256
There's nothing left
that can make it
to those mountains.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.469
Hey, Val. Quiet, man.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:59.014
lt doesn't matter now.
They know we're here.

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:01.767
Oh, shit!
We need a helicopter
is what we need.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.352
Or a goddamn tank!

01:07:03.436 --> 01:07:04.937
Wait a minute.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.314
Wait a minute.
The Cat!

01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:08.691
Could we take the Cat?

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:11.151
Oh, Jesus.
lt's slower than hell.

01:07:11.236 --> 01:07:12.569
Yeah, but it weighs
better than 30 tons.

01:07:12.654 --> 01:07:14.530
There's no way they
could lift 30 tons.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:15.698
Could they? l mean. . .

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:18.575
But we can't all
fit on the bulldozer.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:22.413
No.

01:07:22.956 --> 01:07:26.208
No, but we could
drag something, though.

01:07:26.292 --> 01:07:29.294
We could pull
a car behind it.
l don't know.

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.464
Hell, that old semitrailer.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.217
lts tires are flat.
Doesn't matter.

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:37.052
That Cat can
pull anything.

01:07:37.137 --> 01:07:38.762
Well, all right.

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:40.806
We just roll on
out of here.

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:42.516
We've got a plan !

01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:50.566
Of course,
that's a hell of
a long walk.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:54.027
Listen, they only respond
to vibration, right?

01:07:54.112 --> 01:07:56.739
Well, couldn't we
distract them somehow?

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.074
Yeah. Good.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:01.827
Something to
keep them busy,
like a decoy.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.873
Hey, Melvin,
you wanna make a buck?

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.249
Eat it!

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:08.751
How about the tractor?

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:11.587
Walter's little tractor?
Start him up.

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.380
Let him go out
by himself.

01:08:13.465 --> 01:08:17.009
Let those things
follow him all over
if they like that noise.

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:19.553
Not bad.
What do you think?

01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.568
Ground's getting
closer, Earl.
Yeah.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:36.569
l say we go with
Miguel's plan.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.515
Just hold on, Nancy!

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.767
l'm making the run
for the Cat.

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:07.893
Like hell you are.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:09.353
Get real, Earl.
l'm faster than you.

01:09:09.437 --> 01:09:10.645
But l'm best at
driving the Cat.

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:11.814
Not while l'm around.

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:13.148
Look, damn it!
Now listen to me.

01:09:13.233 --> 01:09:14.441
l'm older
and l'm wiser.

01:09:14.526 --> 01:09:16.609
Yeah? Well,
you're half right.

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:23.658
Damn ! l lost.
Guess l'll have to do it.

01:09:23.743 --> 01:09:25.702
l won.
l pick who does it.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:28.497
Ready when
you are, Miguel.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:46.139
There he is.
There he goes!

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:48.892
He's chasing it.
He's chasing it.

01:09:52.772 --> 01:09:56.024
lt's going.
This one's going, too!

01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:58.902
Good luck, shithead.

01:09:58.987 --> 01:10:00.946
Don't worry about me,
jerk-off.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:09.371
Shit!

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.668
You suicidal
son of a bitch.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:31.977
Keep going !

01:10:39.986 --> 01:10:42.154
Oh, my God !
Oh, my God !

01:10:45.450 --> 01:10:46.742
Come on !

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:49.953
They're gonna get him !

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:54.833
Val, stop!
They're coming !
Be quiet!

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.168
Don't move!

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.640
lt worked.
They can't find him.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:18.982
We gotta. . .

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.944
We gotta make some noise.

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.445
A lot of noise!

01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:27.741
Hey, you sorry
sons of bitches!
Come and get my ass!

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:31.787
Over here, you slime bucket!
Come get me!

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:44.591
Come on.
What are you, scared?
Come on.

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:58.438
Hey, what's she doing?

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.579
That did it, girl !
God damn good thinking.

01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:42.793
You okay?
Yeah.

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:49.382
Here goes.

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.311
Here.
Yeah.

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:22.082
God damn !

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:24.167
Armored transport.

01:14:24.418 --> 01:14:25.961
Burt! Heather!

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:27.420
Let's get going !
Let's move it.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:29.339
Burt! Heather!

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:33.426
Come on, let's go,
you two. We're headed
for the mountains.

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:36.138
lf that's how we're doing it,
we're going prepared.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.641
We can't hold still long.
These things are damn smart.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.059
They're getting
smarter by the minute.

01:14:41.144 --> 01:14:42.310
That's fine.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.020
We've got some new
things to teach them.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.078
You see that?

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.998
They're doing it again.
They try it every time
l stop!

01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.583
Come on, now.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.170
Jesus Christ!
We're only going
nine miles.

01:15:08.254 --> 01:15:11.715
Yeah, well, those things
are gonna be on our ass
every foot of the way, right?

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:15.177
Just hurry!
Burt, Heather, what
are you doing up there?

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.303
Can't you see
we're sinking?

01:15:16.387 --> 01:15:17.596
Get in the trailer!

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:20.265
What do you think?
Max firepower or this?

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.516
l go for penetration.

01:15:21.601 --> 01:15:25.020
The .458, shooting solids.
Less ammo to carry.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:26.771
Come on, Burt.
Move it!

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:29.816
Watch these ammo boxes!

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:30.942
Come on, Burt!

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:32.611
Heather, hurry!

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:34.029
Tell them to come on !

01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:35.363
Okay, now!

01:15:35.448 --> 01:15:37.741
Now! Come on ! Come on !

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.956
Hey, give me a gun.
l'll take one.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:47.792
l wouldn't give you a gun
if it was World War lll.

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:09.481
Food for five years.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.567
A thousand gallons of gas,
air filtration,

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:14.736
water filtration,
Geiger counter,

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.363
bomb shelter.

01:16:19.408 --> 01:16:22.494
Underground
goddamn monsters!

01:16:34.674 --> 01:16:38.176
Yo, there we go!
Solid rock.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.560
Any sign of them?

01:16:48.688 --> 01:16:51.022
Maybe they just
gave up, you know?

01:16:54.193 --> 01:16:55.819
Hey, what's that?

01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:00.198
Damn it! What the hell
are they doing?

01:17:00.283 --> 01:17:01.950
l don't care
what they're doing

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.661
as long as they're
doing it way over there.

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:13.253
Wait, wait!
Look out!

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:19.509
Mindy!

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:21.553
Mommy!
Everybody stay here.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.430
Burt, you okay?
l'm okay.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:25.932
Are they gonna get us?
What happened?

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:29.144
Burt, you sure
you're okay?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.562
Yeah.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:31.938
Earl, what happened?

01:17:32.023 --> 01:17:33.815
What happened?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:36.151
They dug a trap.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.069
l can't believe this.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.406
All right.

01:17:42.241 --> 01:17:43.366
Here.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:58.340
Let me have my gun.

01:18:02.803 --> 01:18:05.180
Hungry? Eat this!

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.557
Everybody down !

01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:18.651
There they are!

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:19.736
Did you get one?

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:20.945
l don't know.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:22.072
No, there's still
two of them.

01:18:22.156 --> 01:18:24.240
Look, there're two
different dust trails.

01:18:24.325 --> 01:18:26.159
Sure made them
think twice though.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:27.577
What the hell's in
those things, Burt?

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:30.330
A few household chemicals
in the proper proportion.

01:18:35.503 --> 01:18:38.004
Here they come.
They're coming back!

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.639
We'll have to make
a run for those rocks.

01:18:47.723 --> 01:18:49.557
l don't know, Val.
That's a hell of
a long way.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:50.850
Yeah, man,
they'll get us!

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.395
They're sure as
hell gonna get us
if we stay here.

01:18:53.479 --> 01:18:55.688
Hey, Burt!
You have any more
of those bombs?

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.107
We've got you
covered, Rhonda.

01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:00.402
Well, what if we
throw one that way,
the way that we wanna go?

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:02.987
Then when it explodes,
l mean, if it drives
them away,

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:05.323
we run like
goddamn bastards.

01:19:06.117 --> 01:19:07.367
Pardon my French.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:12.455
What if they
don't get scared?
What if they don't run?

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:14.874
l don't think it
does scare them.
lt hurts them.

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:17.168
They're so
sensitive to sound,
they gotta run.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:19.003
Oh, hell,
she's got my vote!

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.673
That's it!
We're making
a run for it!

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:23.216
We're going
for the rocks.

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.093
l don't know, man.
They're too fast.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:26.344
You can't outrun them.
No way!

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:29.639
Yo, Melvin.
This'll make them
think twice.

01:19:29.723 --> 01:19:31.891
Everybody ready to run?

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.191
Heads down !

01:19:48.951 --> 01:19:51.035
lt worked !
There they go!

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:52.745
All right, let's go!

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:53.955
Move.

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:55.290
There you go.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:59.335
Here. Come on, Burt.

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:03.756
Oh, fuck.

01:20:04.091 --> 01:20:06.259
Oh, Burt, you asshole!

01:20:10.931 --> 01:20:12.015
Mommy!

01:20:12.099 --> 01:20:13.892
Mindy, get up.
Get up.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:23.151
Get up here!

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:24.402
l'm with you, honey.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.654
Go, go, go!

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:36.706
Burt, you asshole!
There's no bullets
in this gun.

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:39.417
Got you moving,
didn't it?

01:21:08.822 --> 01:21:10.323
So, now what?

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:14.661
Could we make it
to the mountains,
use Burt's explosives?

01:21:14.745 --> 01:21:15.954
No way.

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:18.790
We'd need 50
of those bombs.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:20.291
Well, that's it.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.044
We're not getting
off this rock.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:27.173
Well, we're not gonna
pole vault out of here.

01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:28.841
That's for damn sure.

01:21:29.802 --> 01:21:31.052
Wait a minute.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:33.429
What're y'all
talking about?

01:21:33.514 --> 01:21:35.473
lt's like you're
giving up or something.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:39.769
They'll just wait out
there till we're dead.
That's exactly what they do.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:42.313
Wait!

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:45.567
For Christ sake,
we could've made
a stand at our place.

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:48.152
We had food, water.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.737
You can't fight
them like that.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:53.032
So you two
screw-ups hauled us
way the hell out here?

01:21:56.829 --> 01:22:00.081
Hey, why don't you
just back off,
string bean?

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.166
You know, we could've
left your worthless ass
on the roof!

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:03.876
l wish you had,
fearless leader.

01:22:04.003 --> 01:22:06.045
Who the hell put
you two in charge?
Don't push me!

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:08.548
Just back off, Burt.
Just don't goddamn push me!

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:13.595
lf them graboids
don't kill him, l will.

01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:14.846
What?

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:18.182
They'd have torn your
place out from under
you in half an hour.

01:22:18.267 --> 01:22:19.309
Come on. Come on.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.769
Just let it go.
Let it go.
Forget about it.

01:22:23.147 --> 01:22:25.481
l know he does.
He thinks he
knows everything.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:41.205
lf it comes to starvation,
l know what l'm doing.

01:22:42.750 --> 01:22:44.292
Take one of these,

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:49.047
walk right out there
with the fuse lit and
let them take me down.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:51.883
Boom.

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.305
Good Lord, honey.

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.059
Now that's not
a bad idea.

01:23:02.394 --> 01:23:04.604
No, no.
lt gives me an idea.

01:23:04.772 --> 01:23:06.272
Going fishing like.

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.780
There's one.
Straight out in front.

01:23:13.864 --> 01:23:16.199
Let's see if we can
keep him right there.

01:23:16.283 --> 01:23:17.659
All right,
how much we need?

01:23:17.743 --> 01:23:19.327
l don't know.
They're pretty quick.

01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:21.245
Fifteen seconds
at least.

01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:24.666
Which kind of fuse
is that?

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.084
Cannon fuse.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.752
What the hell
you use if for?

01:23:27.836 --> 01:23:29.379
My cannon.

01:23:29.463 --> 01:23:31.172
You guys
watch yourselves.

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:37.011
Right out there
about 30. . .

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:39.472
Oh, man.
You're not gonna
do your lasso thing?

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:42.058
Just 'cause you're
no good with a rope.

01:23:46.146 --> 01:23:47.689
All right, get back!

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.117
Come on, baby.

01:24:00.411 --> 01:24:02.412
Take it.
Take the bait!

01:24:07.167 --> 01:24:08.793
Yeah ! All right!

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:15.091
Look at it!

01:24:15.175 --> 01:24:16.259
Yeah !

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:23.808
All right!

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.654
Okay, one to go.

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.158
Damn ! Where
the hell is he?

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:42.994
Hope he didn't wise up.

01:24:45.956 --> 01:24:47.165
There.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:50.835
Look who it is.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.336
Give me that thing.

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:54.839
This son of a bitch is mine.

01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:00.052
There it goes!

01:25:00.137 --> 01:25:01.137
All right, get back!

01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:02.263
l got it.

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:03.931
Come on. Come on.

01:25:16.528 --> 01:25:18.863
Come on,
lunchtime, snot head.

01:25:21.575 --> 01:25:23.159
All right, get down !

01:25:25.996 --> 01:25:27.163
Shit!

01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:32.210
Oh, my God ! lt's. . .

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:33.503
Get back! Get back!

01:25:33.587 --> 01:25:34.670
Run !

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:37.548
Get up, come on !

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:55.066
What are you doing
out there?

01:26:10.249 --> 01:26:11.666
Okay, let's make
some noise.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.709
Try to distract him.
Come on, everybody.

01:26:29.518 --> 01:26:30.810
Fresh meat!

01:26:44.658 --> 01:26:46.242
Wait, wait, wait.

01:26:48.829 --> 01:26:51.080
This one's not
falling for it.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:54.709
This one ain't dumb.

01:26:55.836 --> 01:26:57.753
He's trying to trick us.

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:01.799
Use your bomb.

01:27:01.884 --> 01:27:03.968
lt's our last one.

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:07.680
What else you
gonna use it for?

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:10.766
So what if we
make it to the rocks?

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:13.060
We'll be dead in
three days anyway.

01:27:13.145 --> 01:27:15.438
Well, l wanna live
for the three days.

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:17.440
What the hell?
What's the matter?

01:27:17.524 --> 01:27:19.191
Use the bomb,
for God sakes!

01:27:19.276 --> 01:27:20.860
Throw that bomb, man !

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.486
Scare him away!

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.489
Throw the bomb!

01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:31.662
This bastard ain't
smarter than us.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.707
For Christ's sake, Val !

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.250
l'm gonna go for it.

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:37.752
Go for what?

01:27:49.056 --> 01:27:50.264
What are you doing?

01:27:50.349 --> 01:27:52.683
l got a goddamn plan !

01:27:55.854 --> 01:27:57.355
Where the hell is it?

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:02.860
l've got it!

01:28:08.241 --> 01:28:10.826
This better be
one hell of a great plan !

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:19.543
Get ready!

01:28:20.712 --> 01:28:21.879
Light it, man ! Light it!

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:23.089
Not yet. Not yet!

01:28:23.173 --> 01:28:25.257
Come on.
What are you waiting for?

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:27.301
Go!

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:31.013
Come on ! Come on !
Come on ! Come on !

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:34.392
Too far!
You threw it behind him.

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:43.192
Run, Val ! Run !

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:49.240
Yeah !

01:28:51.118 --> 01:28:54.412
Can you fly, you sucker?
Can you fly?

01:29:22.149 --> 01:29:26.068
Well, it just
suddenly hit me,
you know.

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:28.320
Stampede.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:36.787
Way to go!

01:29:36.872 --> 01:29:38.622
Way to go, Val !

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:50.342
Now, the second
we hit Bixby, we start
making some phone calls.

01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:52.887
l mean, we could make
some real money
on this thing.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.514
We could get in
People magazine.

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:58.768
People? Hell !
National Geographic.

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:01.312
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:04.899
Smile.

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.662
Burt loaned me
his camera.

01:30:18.747 --> 01:30:21.165
Yeah. He gave us
these tires, too.

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:28.255
lt's all pretty
exciting, huh?

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.968
There's gonna be
major research, and
l'm gonna be in on it.

01:30:33.804 --> 01:30:37.515
The first thing to do
is take some pictures
of that one we dug up.

01:30:38.183 --> 01:30:40.017
Yeah. Yeah.

01:30:40.102 --> 01:30:42.520
Pictures seem
like a good idea.

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:46.440
Yeah, well,
thanks for everything,

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:48.651

saving my life and stuff.

01:30:51.655 --> 01:30:53.072
You're welcome.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.076
Maybe l'll see you sometime?

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.369
Uh-huh.

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:10.756

01:31:22.978 --> 01:31:26.063
l mean,
what's a woman like her
want with a guy like me?

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:28.399
She's going
for her damn PhD.

01:31:31.236 --> 01:31:32.486
Rhonda?

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.488
