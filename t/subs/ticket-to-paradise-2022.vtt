WEBVTT

00:35.953 --> 00:39.122
[siren wailing]

00:39.206 --> 00:40.624
[architect] So you're asking her tonight?

00:40.707 --> 00:42.709
[sighs] Yeah. Any advice?

00:42.793 --> 00:46.004
Go for the grand gesture.
I used to do stuff like that all the time.

00:46.088 --> 00:49.049
He never did anything like that.
It was totally out of character.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.260
[auctioneer] 40,000. Do I have 45?

00:51.343 --> 00:52.636
-Actually…
-[auctioneer] 45,000.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.181
…David's proposal was probably
the only time he ever surprised me.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.308
[David] We dated all four years
she was in college.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.894
I had a spot in the master's program
for architecture,

01:00.978 --> 01:02.980
so I was definitely staying in Chicago.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.816
Then out of nowhere,
I get an offer from a great gallery in LA.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.900
[auctioneer] 70,000?

01:06.984 --> 01:07.985
[art collector] Seventy.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.236
70,000.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.821
So the night before graduation…

01:10.904 --> 01:12.906
…and she springs it on me
she's leaving.

01:12.990 --> 01:15.075
And I'm calm.
You know, happy for her.

01:15.158 --> 01:17.202
[art collector] He freaks out completely.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.373
So, the next morning, the ceremony,

01:21.456 --> 01:24.501
I'm up there walking towards
the dean and my diploma,

01:24.585 --> 01:30.382
and suddenly, there's David,
right next to me, down on one knee.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.593
And she starts crying.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.428
I'm so embarrassed.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.848
The whole place erupts.
Everybody's clapping and shouting.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.100
Except her parents.
They thought she was too young.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.144
-They thought I could do better.
-[auctioneer] Going once.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.812
But who ever listens
to their parents?

01:43.896 --> 01:45.397
Sold to Georgia Cotton.

01:48.400 --> 01:51.612
Long story short,
she didn't move to California,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.906
and a month later,
we were pregnant with Lily.

01:53.989 --> 01:56.575
[breathes heavily] That's amazing!
Wait, how long ago?

01:57.409 --> 01:59.536
Let me do the math.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.581
March 7th, it'll be 25 years.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.708
Incredible. Twenty-five years of marriage.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.002
Oh, God. We're not married.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.920
God, no. [grunts]

02:09.003 --> 02:11.548
[chuckles] We divorced five years later.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.219
And it's not one of those
amicable divorces you see on TV.

02:15.302 --> 02:17.846
I try not to be in the same time zone
if I can help it.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.057
But Lily's graduating tomorrow,
so here I am.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.642
Wow, that's gotta be awkward.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.186
What? No. Ancient history.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.438
Oh, yeah. Nightmare. [chuckles]

02:27.314 --> 02:28.482
Check, please.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.984
[students chattering]

02:32.945 --> 02:34.154
What are you doing?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.241
-I'm packing.
-You're packing work.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.077
Don't pack work.
Why would you pack work?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.621
Because it's a short vacation
and a very long life afterwards.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.122
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,

02:44.206 --> 02:46.291
and I really don't think
this whole "being an adult" thing

02:46.375 --> 02:48.836
-is gonna work out for me.
-[cell phone vibrating]

02:48.919 --> 02:51.463
[sighs] Yeah, well,
I don't really have a choice.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.382
Hey, Mom.

02:53.465 --> 02:57.511
So I'm just steaming my outfit,
and I am wondering where I'm sitting.

02:58.095 --> 03:02.558
Not that it matters. To me, I mean. Just--
I mean, it doesn't matter to me at all.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.142
-Then why did you--
-[cell phone beeps]

03:04.226 --> 03:05.227
Oh, hang on. It's Dad.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.770
[steamer hisses]

03:06.854 --> 03:08.856
Hey, Dad. Mom's on the other line.

03:08.939 --> 03:10.858
-[David] Don't say hi from me.
-[Lily sighs]

03:10.941 --> 03:12.484
You're not sitting together,
okay?

03:12.568 --> 03:14.111
You're on opposite sides
of the auditorium,

03:14.194 --> 03:15.612
which is the size of Rhode Island.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.239
That's the smallest state.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.448
[cell phone beeps]

03:19.283 --> 03:24.288
So you promise? No mean comments,
no arguing, no passive aggression?

03:24.371 --> 03:26.874
What about aggressive
aggression? Is that okay?

03:26.957 --> 03:28.333
[chuckles] I love you.

03:28.417 --> 03:29.668
[Georgia] I love you.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.046
[sighs] This is gonna be
an unbearable day.

03:33.130 --> 03:36.925
Come on. We shake an old guy's hand
and wear a dumb hat.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.510
What could possibly go wrong?

03:39.845 --> 03:41.346
They're sitting together.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.394
Good afternoon.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.229
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

03:49.313 --> 03:52.900
On behalf of the faculty
and staff of Pullman University…

03:52.983 --> 03:53.984
Big day.

03:54.067 --> 03:58.488
…it is my privilege to welcome
the parents, family and friends

03:58.572 --> 04:00.157
of our graduating seniors.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.950
You gotta be kidding me.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.871
Guess this is my seat, as you haven't
had a date since Lily was in braces.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.081
At least when I do date,
it's age appropriate.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.166
[Georgia scoffs]

04:09.249 --> 04:11.376
You just don't like him
because he's French.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.755
I like the French. I like their fries.
Their toast. Their mustard.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.089
I specifically asked Lily
not to seat us together.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.466
You called her? That's so pathetic.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.801
-Shh. It's starting.
-Don't shush me.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.720
-Shh.
-Don't shush me.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.182
So, without further ado,
let's begin the roll call.

04:25.933 --> 04:28.227
-Wren Butler.
-[all cheering]

04:28.310 --> 04:29.311
Yes!

04:31.396 --> 04:32.731
Wrenny!

04:37.319 --> 04:39.905
Excuse me.
That's my armrest.

04:39.988 --> 04:40.989
No, it's in the middle.

04:41.073 --> 04:45.577
-This is so like you. Take, take, take.
-It is not a metaphor. It is an armrest.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.497
-Give me half, please. I would like half.
-Just stop. Just stop.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.708
Just give me half!
What is wrong with you?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.335
-I just want half!
-[dean] Lily Cotton.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.258
-Take a picture.
-You take a picture.

04:59.341 --> 05:01.009
-I'm in the moment.
-Why do you need a picture?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.886
-So I don't forget the moment.
-Ah…

05:03.595 --> 05:05.180
-[Georgia] Love you.
-Love you more.

05:05.264 --> 05:06.390
-So proud.
-Prouder.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.933
-[Georgia] The most proud.
-Proudest!

05:08.016 --> 05:10.769
Couldn't be more proud. Bursting.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.897
-She got my nose. You're welcome, honey.
-[David] Yeah.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.148
Love you, Lily.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.610
I can't believe my baby's a lawyer.

05:18.694 --> 05:20.362
You and me both.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.948
-Can everyone please stop shouting?
-Who's shouting?

05:23.031 --> 05:24.074
There you go again.

05:24.157 --> 05:27.327
Some of us maybe had
seven too many Jägerbombs last night.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.497
Just one too many.
The other six were perfection.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.626
Well, it's a long flight to Bali.
You can sleep on the plane.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.003
[sighs]

05:36.086 --> 05:38.255
Lily can work on the plane.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.884
[Georgia] She had at least 90 hours
of exams in the last week.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.887
[David] Well, in the next three months,
she starts at the top law firm in Chicago.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.972
You can't show up at a gunfight
with a tan.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.267
Okay, she needs to decompress,
and you need to calm down.

05:50.350 --> 05:53.437
You know, telling someone to calm down
has literally never calmed anyone down

05:53.520 --> 05:54.771
in the history of the universe.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.356
-I know that.
-You know that.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.774
[whispers] Inside voices, please.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.360
I'm taking briefs. I'm taking sunblock.
I'll be fine.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.654
You know, for once,
you could back me up.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.199
-I could, but then I'd be wrong too.
-[Lily grunts]

06:05.282 --> 06:06.533
Okay, we should go.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.327
Do you see what you did?
You blew the goodbye.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.411
-I did that.
-Uh-huh.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.080
-It wasn't just him. Bye.
-I love you.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.248
See, it wasn't just me.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.626
-Hey. Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.836
-Bye-bye-bye!
-Bye-bye-bye! [chuckles]

06:18.420 --> 06:20.214
-Bye, Lily's dad and mom…
-[David chuckles]

06:20.297 --> 06:22.966
…'cause my dad and mom
don't even know I'm going.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.928
I love you. Be safe!

06:26.011 --> 06:27.221
Make good choices.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.305
Always.

Rarely.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.933
[David chuckles]

06:31.934 --> 06:32.935
[Georgia] And she's gone.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.687
See you again. Never.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.022
Hopefully not that soon.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.702
Who else?

10:20.537 --> 10:23.373
-Uh, well, I guess just them. [chuckles]
-[chuckles]

10:24.124 --> 10:26.710
And what about you?
What's your story?

10:26.793 --> 10:27.920
I'm a seaweed farmer.

10:28.754 --> 10:30.547
-[laughs]
-What?

10:31.340 --> 10:33.425
That's a sentence I haven't heard a lot.

10:33.509 --> 10:35.594
Well, you've been spending time
with the wrong people.

10:35.677 --> 10:36.678
[laughs]

10:36.762 --> 10:40.265
My father was a seaweed farmer,
his father before him…

10:40.349 --> 10:45.145
And what about
his father before him?

10:45.229 --> 10:47.814
He was a fisherman.
They can't all be winners.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.400
[both laughing]

10:54.821 --> 10:56.406
Why are you looking at me like that?

10:58.784 --> 11:00.244
I'm sorry. [chuckles]

11:00.327 --> 11:01.328
I just, um--

11:02.079 --> 11:03.872
I have this crazy--

11:05.207 --> 11:07.459
I just really wanna kiss you right now.

11:07.543 --> 11:11.046
But don't worry. I won't just, like,
you know, suddenly…

11:25.269 --> 11:26.353
[slurping]

11:31.066 --> 11:33.068
[birds chirping]

12:00.220 --> 12:02.264
[chirping continues]

12:29.416 --> 12:31.126
[people chattering]

12:34.755 --> 12:36.298
-The water's warm.
-[Lily] Oh.

12:37.799 --> 12:38.800
Okay.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.185
You been out here for a while?

12:49.144 --> 12:50.812
The floor isn't that comfy.

12:56.318 --> 12:58.487
I wish I went to work in a bathing suit.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.031
[chuckles] This isn't work.

13:01.114 --> 13:05.577
It's a partnership. With Dewi Danu,
the goddess of the sea.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.376
All we have to do
is understand her tides and moods…

13:14.461 --> 13:18.090
not throw plastic into her,
not overfarm her,

13:18.882 --> 13:20.592
and she'll give us wonderful lives.

13:21.885 --> 13:23.387
Nature, God and people.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.641
Balance the three, and you have harmony.

13:32.187 --> 13:33.480
[sighs]

13:33.564 --> 13:35.399
I am so out of balance.

13:38.694 --> 13:39.945
You can find it here.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.092
[artist] It's a savage commentary

14:02.176 --> 14:05.179
on the illusion of freedom in our society.

14:05.262 --> 14:09.433
But look closer and you'll divine
a fundamental compassion that--

14:09.516 --> 14:11.310
I think it's upside down.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.022
-[artist] Really?
-[cell phone vibrating]

14:16.398 --> 14:17.649
Would you excuse me, please?

14:19.902 --> 14:21.862
I'm working, David.
I really don't have time.

14:21.945 --> 14:25.532
Unless you became an oncologist
since we last spoke, you got time.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.826
There you go,
always diminishing what I do.

14:27.910 --> 14:30.495
What you do
diminishes what you do.

14:30.579 --> 14:32.831
-Check your email.
-I do check it. You're blocked.

14:32.915 --> 14:33.916
Lily wrote us.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.918
Whatever this is, it's your fault.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.463
[people chattering]

14:39.546 --> 14:40.839
She what?

14:43.050 --> 14:44.426
[passenger] Excuse me.

14:44.510 --> 14:45.928
-Thank you.
-[PA system chimes]

14:46.011 --> 14:50.557
[pilot] This is East Atlantic flight 576
with continuing service to Denpasar, Bali.

14:50.641 --> 14:54.144
Thanks for everyone's patience as we
welcome aboard our Los Angeles passengers.

14:54.228 --> 14:55.521
Can I get you
some champagne?

14:55.604 --> 14:57.189
-Mmm.
-Two, please.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.983
I only drink when I fly.
[chuckles]

15:01.193 --> 15:03.278
I'm Beth-Ann Flannery.

15:03.362 --> 15:06.114
I like to befriend my seatmates
in case we crash,

15:06.198 --> 15:09.743
so they're more inclined to
pull me from the wreckage.

15:09.826 --> 15:14.289
-I have two children and a dog--
-[speaking Italian]

15:16.333 --> 15:18.043
[in English] Okay? Okay.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.046
[Georgia] Excuse me, ma'am.
I think your things are in my seat.

15:21.129 --> 15:22.256
[Beth-Ann] Oh, sorry.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.550
Oh, come on.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.093
You've gotta be kidding me.

15:26.885 --> 15:27.886
You speak English!

15:28.595 --> 15:30.556
You're still doing
the Italian tourist bit.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.349
-[gasps]
-Excuse me, ma'am?

15:32.432 --> 15:34.101
I need to sit somewhere else.

15:34.184 --> 15:35.853
I'm sorry. It's a full flight.

15:35.936 --> 15:36.937
We used to be married.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.397
The worst 19 years of my life.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.024
-We were only married for five.
-I'm counting the recovery.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.401
I can't sit there.

15:42.484 --> 15:44.570
-There's nothing I can do.
-Wha--

15:45.737 --> 15:47.447
I'll swap with you, dear.

15:47.531 --> 15:49.950
-Just remember, in case we go down.
-Oh…

15:50.868 --> 15:52.536
[Beth-Ann]
You owe me one.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.538
-Thank you.
-I told you I was gonna go get her.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.622
In four days' time--

15:55.706 --> 15:59.376
Our daughter's going to marry a guy
she just met, millions of miles from home.

15:59.459 --> 16:02.379
Excuse me, did the middle of my sentence
interrupt the beginning of yours?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.756
-She's throwing her career away.
-Just like her mother did.

16:04.840 --> 16:06.508
Which is why I'm the only one
that can stop her.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.260
-She doesn't listen to him.
-She listens to me.

16:08.343 --> 16:10.679
-Oh, did she respond to your email?
-Yes.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.222
And there she is!

16:14.349 --> 16:15.893
-Oh, my God. Paul!
-[Paul chuckles]

16:15.976 --> 16:17.102
Paul?

16:17.186 --> 16:19.730
I know you love a surprise. I know you do.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.648
-Mmm.
-You!

16:22.316 --> 16:23.942
Looks like someone upgraded.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.152
She hates a surprise.

16:26.445 --> 16:28.071
David?
What are you doing here?

16:28.155 --> 16:30.199
I'm flying to Bali.
What are you doing here?

16:30.282 --> 16:31.658
I'm flying you to Bali.

16:32.326 --> 16:34.077
-I couldn't let her go alone…
-Ah.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.121
…so I traded flights with a friend.

16:36.205 --> 16:39.082
Gotta captain three long hauls
to Uruguay next month, but…

16:39.791 --> 16:41.418
The things you do for love, right?

16:41.502 --> 16:43.670
-[whispers] It's so sweet.
-[whispers] I know.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.841
-[Paul] Mmm.
-So sweet.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.093
-[speaking French]
-[Georgia] Mmm.

16:51.094 --> 16:53.388
-[Georgia] Ah, oui. Me too.
-[kissing]

16:54.473 --> 16:56.350
[both grunting]

16:57.976 --> 16:59.895
-[chuckles]
-[speaking French]

17:02.022 --> 17:04.441
[chuckles, in English] Oh, my. Those eyes.

17:04.525 --> 17:05.858
Couldn't you just
swim in them?

17:05.943 --> 17:08.319
They're blue. Big deal.
So are my socks.

17:08.403 --> 17:10.821
And Frenchmen make such great lovers.

17:10.906 --> 17:12.950
That's a rumor
they started about themselves.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.367
Oh, keep telling yourself that.

17:14.451 --> 17:16.244
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

17:16.328 --> 17:17.329
Champagne!

17:17.412 --> 17:18.664
Oh, two, please.

17:18.747 --> 17:21.375
Just leave the bottle. Thank you.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.089
Baby, I don't think that him tagging along
on your trip is going to help.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.674
Well, that's a hot take.

17:28.757 --> 17:31.885
The last time David was actually helpful
was the night we made Lily.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.721
[chuckles] There's an image
I'm not crazy about.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.891
Mmm. You live. You learn.
You upgrade.

17:37.975 --> 17:38.976
[curtain opens]

17:40.269 --> 17:42.813
Aren't you supposed to be
flying the plane, Paul?

17:42.896 --> 17:44.857
Or at least not making out
with the passengers?

17:44.940 --> 17:47.651
Just this passenger.
The only one that counts.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.738
It's a totally foreign concept to you,
but Paul puts me first.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.240
He supports everything I do.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.409
That's because
everything she does is perfect.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.660
He's exaggerating.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.744
Is he?

17:57.828 --> 17:59.204
-Are you?
-I'm really not.

17:59.288 --> 18:01.164
-Sure you are.
-If you say so.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.083
-[plane rumbling]
-[passengers clamoring]

18:03.667 --> 18:05.878
Okay, it's just a little turbulence.

18:05.961 --> 18:08.672
The plane is actually designed
to right itself in--

18:09.381 --> 18:10.591
Please go back to your seats.

18:11.466 --> 18:15.137
-[fasten seat belt sign chimes]
-[passengers gasp]

18:15.220 --> 18:19.099
That was my house. My garden. My house.

18:19.183 --> 18:21.351
Why do I have so many
pictures of my house?

18:21.435 --> 18:23.478
Oh! There's Charlie. He's my dog.

18:23.562 --> 18:26.190
-Did I mention he's very old and unwell?
-[thunder rumbles]

18:26.273 --> 18:28.901
-It's gonna be all right. Really.
-You're right. It's gonna be fine.

18:28.984 --> 18:31.737
-[passengers clamoring]
-[thunderclap]

18:33.113 --> 18:34.114
[passengers gasp]

18:36.950 --> 18:38.994
[Paul] These things happen, of course,
you know.

18:39.077 --> 18:41.663
Pilots aren't magicians.
We only have so much control up there.

18:41.747 --> 18:43.498
Of course. People understand that.

18:43.582 --> 18:45.000
You're the fucking worst.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.503
Nice try killing us, asshole!

18:49.254 --> 18:51.423
Maybe you should go,
before they get out the pitchforks.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.759
-I'll see you when you get back here.
-Yeah.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.136
-Okay. I'll see you in four days.
-Yes.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.310
Don't blame yourself, Paul.

19:03.393 --> 19:06.146
It could happen to anybody
who doesn't know what they're doing.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.523
Where's Lily?

19:07.606 --> 19:10.400
I thought you got her email.
She's meeting us off the boat.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.111
What?

19:29.044 --> 19:31.672
This is the most incredible place
I've ever seen.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.006
[David] You know what's incredible?

19:33.090 --> 19:36.343
-Hawaii. And it's in America.
-You've never been to Hawaii.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.679
-You don't know where I've been.
-You've never been to Hawaii.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.181
-Ah…
-Okay. Let's talk game plan.

19:41.849 --> 19:45.018
As much as this will pain us both,
we have to call a truce to make this work.

19:45.102 --> 19:46.436
Yes, we need to be in lockstep.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.896
-No meanness.
-No arguing.

19:47.980 --> 19:49.731
-We speak as one.
-Exactly right.

19:49.815 --> 19:51.942
-When do we start?
-Right after we see Lily.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.698
We tell her the wedding is off,
and we'll bring her home.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.868
[Georgia] Well, you know whenever we say
"don't" to Lily, she just hears "do."

20:00.951 --> 20:05.247
I say we go in
100% there for her in all ways.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.958
Just supportive and loving.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.669
And that's how we trick her into
dumping Mr. Seaweed.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.589
That's interesting. Now, I'm thinking
about a Trojan horse sort of thing.

20:13.672 --> 20:15.257
We make her think
we're okay with the wedding,

20:15.340 --> 20:17.259
and then once we're in,
we get her to end it herself.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.928
That's literally what I just said.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.056
I don't remember
anything about a Trojan horse.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.853
[locals chattering in Balinese]

20:31.899 --> 20:33.066
[Georgia] Okay, so you got the plan?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.818
[David] Of course I got the plan.
It's my plan.

20:34.902 --> 20:35.986
Thanks, fellas.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.364
-[David laughing]
-[Georgia] Hey.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.660
-Hey, guys! Hey, Dad.
-Hey. Hi.

20:43.744 --> 20:45.621
-Hi.
-Hi. Hey and hi. [chuckles]

20:46.496 --> 20:49.166
So, did you make a pact
to not murder each other

20:49.249 --> 20:50.334
until you murder me first?

20:50.417 --> 20:53.086
-Come on. Nobody is murdering anybody.
-[chuckles] No, no.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.130
I mean, of course,
we have some questions.

20:55.214 --> 20:57.883
We are your parents.
We are here for you, my love.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.510
-Yes, we're in lockstep.
-Yes. Right.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.929
I've been really freaked out
about what you guys were gonna say.

21:02.012 --> 21:04.932
Especially you, Dad. I mean, you had
a panic attack when I pierced my ears.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.725
-Yes.
-Well, it's just about hygiene.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.810
And I know how much
you wanted the lawyer thing. It just--

21:08.894 --> 21:11.396
-Well--
-We just-- We want you to be happy, honey.

21:11.480 --> 21:12.606
Yeah.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.024
[exhales]

21:14.107 --> 21:17.736
-Wow. Okay. That is such a relief.
-[chuckles]

21:17.819 --> 21:18.946
All right.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.113
Wow.

21:20.197 --> 21:22.407
-Oh, Wrenny, hi.
-Hey, Wren.

21:22.491 --> 21:25.244
-Don't mind me. Just here for backup.
-We're all good now.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.246
You guys are gonna love it here,
and you'll love Gede.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.414
-Love him!
-[Georgia] Gede? That's a nice name.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.166
-Really nice.
-Okay, please stop.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.544
Can't wait to hear
all about seaweed farming.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.673
Are you guys sure you're good with this?

21:38.966 --> 21:40.759
'Cause you know you could just tell me.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.012
You don't have to do
a whole Trojan horse thing.

21:44.847 --> 21:48.100
-What-- What are you-- What are you--
-What? What's it-- What's that?

21:48.183 --> 21:50.227
Didn't you tell me that story, Mom?

21:50.310 --> 21:51.520
No, I told you. Trojan horse?

21:51.603 --> 21:53.647
-I told you that story. That was me.
-Fine.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.900
It doesn't matter.
We just are both here for you.

21:56.984 --> 21:58.193
Yeah. Lockstep.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.594
I don't see why we couldn't have gone
straight to the hotel.

22:23.677 --> 22:26.305
Yeah, well, you were supposed to be here
hours ago. [chuckles]

22:26.388 --> 22:28.390
-It wasn't his fault.
-Pilot error.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.894
The engagement party kinda starts now, so…

22:31.977 --> 22:33.270
Who's gonna be there?

22:34.021 --> 22:35.230
Just close family.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.612
Okay. Time for a walk.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.822
Wait, what?

22:43.906 --> 22:45.073
We get back on at the top.

22:45.157 --> 22:46.742
It just can't make it
with all these people.

22:46.825 --> 22:49.620
Unbelievable.
I want my 4,000 whatevers back.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.622
You know that's like a quarter, right?

22:56.543 --> 22:58.754
Mom, Dad, this is Gede.

23:00.088 --> 23:02.257
[speaking Balinese]

23:02.341 --> 23:03.926
[speaking Balinese]

23:04.009 --> 23:05.427
[in English] Hey.

23:05.511 --> 23:07.471
You learned that
to make me look bad.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.014
You don't need my help there.

23:09.097 --> 23:11.808
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Cotton,
I welcome you to my country

23:11.892 --> 23:12.893
and soon to my home.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.562
Mrs. Cotton is his mother.
You can just call me Georgia.

23:15.646 --> 23:17.731
Oh, as you wish, Georgia.

23:20.442 --> 23:22.653
Yeah,
I'm good with Mr. Cotton.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.488
[motorcycle approaching]

23:24.571 --> 23:25.906
-[Wren] Hi, guys!
-There goes Wren.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.199
[Wren] Bye, guys!

23:28.075 --> 23:30.202
Uh, Georgia,
perhaps I can give you a lift?

23:30.285 --> 23:31.870
-Oh, let's do it.
-Yeah.

23:33.205 --> 23:34.998
-[chuckles]
-[engine starts]

23:35.082 --> 23:36.792
-Bye.
-[Gede] See you there!

23:38.085 --> 23:39.086
[Lily sighs]

23:39.169 --> 23:40.337
Isn't he amazing?

23:41.171 --> 23:42.422
Only if he drops her.

23:43.215 --> 23:44.508
-Dad--
-Come on. Let's go.

23:44.842 --> 23:46.218
[people chattering]

23:50.848 --> 23:52.307
This is just close family?

23:53.141 --> 23:56.603
[Lily] And the incredible thing is,
is that they're all actually close.

23:56.687 --> 24:00.315
Okay. Remember, shoes off inside,
eat with your right hand,

24:00.399 --> 24:02.901
and never,
ever touch anyone's head.

24:04.069 --> 24:05.821
Why would I wanna touch
anyone's head?

24:06.697 --> 24:07.698
Hey, guys.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.116
[Wren whispers] Mr. C?

24:09.199 --> 24:13.620
This is Komang,
and these are his tattoos.

24:13.704 --> 24:14.913
Nice to meet you.

24:14.997 --> 24:15.998
He doesn't know it,

24:16.081 --> 24:18.250
but we're gonna be
having breakfast tomorrow.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.334
Hey.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.337
Is she coming to breakfast too?

24:23.672 --> 24:25.215
-[Wren sighs]
-[Komang chattering]

24:25.299 --> 24:26.925
I need to get one of those.

24:29.845 --> 24:30.929
[in Balinese] Putri!

24:31.013 --> 24:32.014
[in English] Hey.

24:32.097 --> 24:34.266
-What did he call you?
-It means "daughter."

24:34.349 --> 24:35.851
Oh. Oh.

24:35.934 --> 24:37.769
You're my daughter.

24:37.853 --> 24:38.896
My daughter.

24:40.355 --> 24:42.900
-[chuckles]
-From here on, we will share her.

24:42.983 --> 24:47.779
We'll be united for all of time
in the unbreakable bond of family.

24:47.863 --> 24:50.282
-It's us.
-Okay, yeah. You can let go anytime.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.576
-Good.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

24:52.659 --> 24:53.911
Now give me your knife.

24:54.703 --> 24:55.829
My-- My knife?

24:56.413 --> 24:57.414
Give me your knife.

24:58.248 --> 24:59.374
I didn't bring a knife.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.835
-No knife?
-I didn't bring a knife. [chuckles]

25:01.919 --> 25:03.170
-No knife?
-No, no--

25:03.253 --> 25:05.839
-[laughs] Okay.
-No problem.

25:05.923 --> 25:08.217
Wow. [laughs]

25:08.300 --> 25:10.969
It is a Balinese custom
that upon meeting,

25:11.512 --> 25:14.139
the two fathers must cut deeply
into their forearms,

25:15.349 --> 25:18.810
and each smear
the other blood.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.272
[laughing]
You should really see your face.

25:22.356 --> 25:23.857
[laughing]

25:26.276 --> 25:28.445
[both laughing]

25:29.112 --> 25:31.406
-[Lily] Hey, guys! Gimme some.
-Hi.

25:31.490 --> 25:33.367
Yeah. Ow, ow, ow!

25:35.827 --> 25:36.912
[sighs]

25:36.995 --> 25:40.165
What's amazing is with such a big family,
there's always something to celebrate.

25:40.249 --> 25:42.751
But if not, they just celebrate
that it's a big family.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.586
Well, I need to celebrate
learning some names

25:44.670 --> 25:46.588
because there's just
too many people to remember.

25:46.672 --> 25:48.841
I did make a spreadsheet.
I haven't gotten most of them.

25:48.924 --> 25:52.803
-I usually just smile a lot. [chuckles]
-Ah, you're in the kitchen. That's new.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.054
Lily!

25:54.137 --> 25:55.138
[in Balinese] Meme!

25:55.222 --> 25:59.226
[in English] Oh, Mom, Dad, this is
Gede's mother, Suli, and his sister, Losi.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.270
-Losi's training to be a doctor.
-[David] Mmm.

26:01.353 --> 26:03.605
Fantastic. Hi, nice to meet you.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.108
[speaking Balinese]

26:26.044 --> 26:27.588
[in English]
She says, "Welcome."

26:28.755 --> 26:29.756
Oh.

26:31.842 --> 26:34.011
[Gede] The kids play football out here
in the morning before school.

26:34.094 --> 26:35.971
-[David] Mmm.
-You'd be welcome to join in.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.390
Not my game.
I wouldn't count on it.

26:39.057 --> 26:40.350
How do you farm the seaweed?

26:40.434 --> 26:42.186
Oh! Uh, we use nets.

26:42.269 --> 26:44.521
Uh, seedlings are tied
to monofilament lines,

26:44.605 --> 26:47.107
then five weeks later, we bring them in.

26:47.191 --> 26:49.902
A distributor flash freezes it
and ships it out.

26:49.985 --> 26:50.986
Ships it to where?

26:51.737 --> 26:55.073
It used to be mainly Japan.
Now, all over the world.

26:55.866 --> 26:59.369
We just signed a deal with Whole Foods.
So, we're right on your street corner.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.040
[chuckles] Mmm.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.042
[people chattering]

27:06.835 --> 27:09.046
[speaking Balinese]

27:10.130 --> 27:11.882
[in English]
He says you are very beautiful.

27:11.965 --> 27:15.093
Oh. Well, um,
tell him I said thank you.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.261
[speaking Balinese]

27:16.345 --> 27:18.138
[speaking Balinese]

27:19.139 --> 27:22.643
[in English] And now he is saying
you remind him of a very attractive horse.

27:23.185 --> 27:25.395
Oh. Really?

27:26.146 --> 27:27.356
That can't be right.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.067
[speaking Balinese]

27:30.150 --> 27:32.611
[speaking Balinese]

27:33.987 --> 27:36.990
-[in English] No, he-- He did mean horse.
-Oh. [clears throat]

27:37.074 --> 27:38.659
-[speaking Balinese]
-Mmm.

27:39.535 --> 27:40.536
Oh…

27:42.246 --> 27:43.664
-Mr. Cotton?
-Hmm?

27:43.747 --> 27:46.458
I must tell you,
I love your daughter very much.

27:46.542 --> 27:47.584
I don't blame you.

27:47.668 --> 27:50.128
And I appreciate that
it's happening really fast,

27:50.212 --> 27:52.089
and you and Georgia
must be alarmed by that.

27:53.131 --> 27:57.511
Well, you two seem good together.
Lily loves Bali.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.973
I can see her being happy here.
For a while.

28:02.432 --> 28:03.433
For a while?

28:04.351 --> 28:05.978
Well, nothing lasts forever.

28:07.396 --> 28:08.647
Marriage is supposed to.

28:09.523 --> 28:11.859
That's what I thought
till I was sitting across from Georgia

28:11.942 --> 28:14.278
with a bunch of lawyers,
dividing up our stuff.

28:14.945 --> 28:17.823
So, enjoy this.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.868
Right up until the minute
that Lily ends it.

28:20.951 --> 28:25.455
Which she will because she's ambitious,
and she is endlessly curious.

28:25.539 --> 28:30.460
And as beautiful as this island is,
and as pleasant as you seem to be,

28:31.253 --> 28:33.338
ultimately,
it's just not gonna be enough.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.801
A bit of advice. Don't have kids.

28:37.885 --> 28:39.887
Makes it much more complicated
when she takes them

28:39.970 --> 28:41.555
and she goes back to the States.

28:45.142 --> 28:47.686
-I'm hungry. You hungry?
-[pats side]

28:47.769 --> 28:50.230
Yeah, let's get something to eat.
Let's get some food.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.445
[chattering]

28:58.864 --> 29:00.282
[Gede's father claps]

29:00.365 --> 29:01.992
-[speaking Balinese]
-[chattering stops]

29:04.912 --> 29:08.540
[in English] Today, in honor of
our guests of distinction,

29:08.624 --> 29:10.083
I speak to you English.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.795
I'm pretty sure you don't win anything
for finishing the whole pig.

29:14.713 --> 29:18.342
Paul's such a lucky guy.
All that judgment all to himself.

29:18.425 --> 29:24.014
Suli and I welcome with love and peace,
all friends and family, into our home.

29:24.765 --> 29:28.435
Soon also to be the home of Gede and Lily.

29:29.019 --> 29:30.979
-Or not.
-[Gede's father] And how proud we are…

29:31.063 --> 29:32.606
Gede is having second thoughts.

29:32.689 --> 29:34.191
I saw the two of you.
What happened?

29:34.274 --> 29:36.818
[David] I initiated phase two.

29:36.902 --> 29:39.321
We get out of the Trojan horse.
We start killing people.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.782
We are nowhere near phase two.

29:41.865 --> 29:43.659
Maybe you're at a different party,

29:43.742 --> 29:47.120
but from where I'm sitting,
we're about to inherit 150 new in-laws.

29:47.204 --> 29:49.289
Oh, God. You only ever
see things your own way.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.083
Everybody only ever
sees anything their own way.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.793
Explains why you walked out
on me and Lily.

29:52.876 --> 29:54.461
I didn't walk out on Lily.

29:54.545 --> 29:57.005
[speaking Balinese]

29:58.549 --> 30:01.552
[in English] For marriage,
it must to be the right place.

30:02.302 --> 30:04.513
It must to be the right time.

30:05.222 --> 30:07.432
It must to be the right circumstance.

30:07.516 --> 30:10.561
I wish someone had explained that to us.
We were 0 for 3.

30:11.436 --> 30:12.855
-1 for 3.
-Hmm?

30:12.938 --> 30:13.939
1 for 3.

30:14.731 --> 30:16.358
Wrong circumstance,
wrong time.

30:16.441 --> 30:19.820
Right place. By the lake.

30:20.612 --> 30:26.493
So, I announce that Gede will marry Lily
in four days' time,

30:26.577 --> 30:29.788
as suggested by
Ida Anak Lingsir.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.210
Mother of my children, do you agree?

30:35.294 --> 30:37.588
[speaking Balinese]

30:42.259 --> 30:45.262
[in English] She gives her blessing.
For now and for always.

30:46.096 --> 30:49.474
And David? Georgia? Do you agree?

30:50.851 --> 30:53.604
Um, yes,
we give our blessing.

30:54.396 --> 30:56.148
-Yep.
-Yes. For now--

30:56.231 --> 30:57.649
-And always.

30:57.733 --> 30:58.734
-[Gede's father] Great.
-Right.

30:58.817 --> 30:59.818
That's good.

31:05.282 --> 31:09.828
[Lily sighs] That went great.
Just great.

31:09.912 --> 31:12.915
[Gede] Absolutely it did.
Could not have gone any better.

31:16.835 --> 31:18.754
What were you and my dad
talking about by the beach?

31:18.837 --> 31:21.381
Seaweed, mostly.
He had a lot of questions.

31:23.842 --> 31:26.011
-He loves you.
-[chuckles]

31:26.094 --> 31:29.139
He loves you. They both do.

31:30.599 --> 31:34.311
Well, I'm the only thing
they can ever agree on. [chuckles]

31:35.020 --> 31:36.021
Really?

31:36.813 --> 31:37.814
Good to know.

31:40.901 --> 31:42.986
[hotel clerk] Welcome to the Hotel Waruna.

31:43.070 --> 31:47.324
It is a very great pleasure
to see your smiling faces.

31:48.909 --> 31:52.913
You, sir, are in 221. Really good room.

31:53.956 --> 31:55.249
Make sure I'm a long way
from her.

31:55.832 --> 31:56.834
And you, madam?

31:58.168 --> 31:59.962
A very long way, please.

32:00.045 --> 32:03.382
222. Almost just as really good.

32:05.634 --> 32:06.885
Do you still snore?

32:07.886 --> 32:10.848
Do you know anybody that snores less
when they get older?

32:11.348 --> 32:13.600
If I'm gonna be listening
to you all night,

32:13.684 --> 32:15.644
I'm gonna do it from the better room.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.981
You know, you used to do sleep karate.

32:19.064 --> 32:21.900
You'd fling yourself around the bed
like you were attacking it.

32:22.442 --> 32:25.279
I wasn't asleep.
I was attacking you.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.363
There you go.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.741
Try to keep the snoring down.

32:29.825 --> 32:33.203
-I have a nasal strip.
-It's a mystery you're still alone.

32:50.387 --> 32:51.930
[grunts]

32:54.349 --> 32:55.475
Ah!

33:02.900 --> 33:04.276
Get another one of these?

33:05.569 --> 33:07.321
I'll have two of whatever he's having.

33:08.906 --> 33:10.949
Hello, Wren.
What are you doing here?

33:11.033 --> 33:12.492
Unlike your daughter,
I've never been

33:12.576 --> 33:15.204
a thatched-hut-with-a-dirt-floor
kind of gal.

33:15.287 --> 33:17.831
I've got a nicely appointed
broom closet here.

33:17.915 --> 33:18.916
Good for you.

33:20.792 --> 33:23.253
You know, I blame you
for this whole shit show.

33:23.337 --> 33:24.463
[Wren] That's what you think of it?

33:25.297 --> 33:26.298
You don't?

33:27.382 --> 33:28.967
Lily's happy.

33:29.051 --> 33:32.179
And after four years of watching her
beat herself up at college,

33:32.262 --> 33:33.889
I love to see that.

33:34.723 --> 33:36.058
I thought you might too.

33:36.141 --> 33:40.354
Hey, look, happy is great.
Lily happy is the greatest of all.

33:40.437 --> 33:45.609
It's just that a weird thing happens
when you become a parent.

33:45.692 --> 33:50.113
When your kid is down,
when they're in pain, it kills you.

33:50.781 --> 33:53.200
But when they're up,
when things are going great,

33:54.910 --> 33:56.870
that's when you get really scared.

33:56.954 --> 33:59.248
Because you don't want it to change,

33:59.331 --> 34:00.749
and you know it will.

34:01.708 --> 34:02.835
Does it always?

34:03.836 --> 34:05.379
[chuckles]

34:08.422 --> 34:09.675
Lily's never said.

34:10.551 --> 34:12.219
What happened with you and Mrs. C?

34:12.844 --> 34:15.097
Same thing that happens
in every relationship.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.516
When it started out, it was unreal…

34:20.643 --> 34:22.271
then it got real.

34:22.353 --> 34:23.563
[chuckles]

34:29.485 --> 34:30.696
Um…

34:31.405 --> 34:33.949
We used to bike out to this place
by the lake.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.411
You know, read, eat, whatever.

34:39.204 --> 34:43.333
And then one day I saw that that place,
that spot, was for sale.

34:43.417 --> 34:45.043
Now, we were young. We had nothing.

34:45.627 --> 34:48.338
But I said,
"Someday, we should live here."

34:48.422 --> 34:53.385
And then she said,
with that smile in her voice,

34:55.304 --> 34:58.098
"Why wait?
Why save the good stuff for later?

34:58.182 --> 35:00.893
Don't we deserve some good stuff
along the way?"

35:01.768 --> 35:03.103
Ah…

35:03.187 --> 35:04.229
She was right.

35:04.313 --> 35:06.982
-Which happens occasionally.
-[Wren chuckles]

35:10.027 --> 35:11.486
Well…

35:11.570 --> 35:13.822
We saved and we scrambled,
and next thing you know,

35:13.906 --> 35:16.742
I'm building the perfect house
in the perfect spot.

35:21.914 --> 35:25.125
So, I was busy.
I was working, paying off our debt.

35:25.209 --> 35:26.752
I was tired. She was tired.

35:29.129 --> 35:32.257
Then, pretty soon, it didn't feel like
we were married at all.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.511
Just felt like we were…

35:37.304 --> 35:40.557
running a day care camp
with someone I used to go out with.

35:44.436 --> 35:47.523
We were sniping. We were fighting.
We were tearing each other down.

35:47.606 --> 35:50.651
And I thought,
if I could just get her in that house…

35:52.569 --> 35:53.737
it'd fix everything.

35:56.448 --> 35:57.658
Make everything okay.

36:01.161 --> 36:05.874
So, one night I get a call
from the people who lived across the lake.

36:07.543 --> 36:10.045
They said they'd seen these flames.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.340
[chuckles]

36:16.301 --> 36:20.138
By the time I got there, it was just ash.

36:23.684 --> 36:26.854
Three weeks later, we were done.

36:29.523 --> 36:30.691
Over a house?

36:31.942 --> 36:33.569
Seemed like a lot more than that.

36:38.740 --> 36:39.908
Good night, Wren.

36:49.668 --> 36:51.461
[birds chirping]

36:56.800 --> 36:58.552
[Paul] Hey, it's looking like
I'm not going to make it

36:58.635 --> 36:59.803
till the morning of the wedding.

36:59.887 --> 37:02.723
Uh, I'm so sorry, baby. How's Lily?

37:02.806 --> 37:03.807
Crazy in love.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.100
That's fantastic!

37:05.184 --> 37:06.935
-It's terrible.
-I couldn't agree more.

37:07.019 --> 37:08.145
She's making a mistake.

37:08.228 --> 37:10.397
And now there's some kind of ceremony.

37:10.480 --> 37:13.066
Gede and Lily exchange rings.
It's a whole thing.

37:13.150 --> 37:14.818
They're not doing the rings
at the wedding?

37:14.902 --> 37:16.403
There's not gonna be a wedding.

37:16.486 --> 37:19.656
I won't let her throw her life away
on some insanely handsome guy

37:19.740 --> 37:21.992
who happens to live
in the most beautiful place on earth.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.369
And yes, I do know how that sounds,
but I'm still right.

37:24.453 --> 37:26.622
[chuckles] You're always right, baby.

37:26.705 --> 37:27.706
We got action.

37:27.789 --> 37:29.416
I'm really not. Gotta go.

37:29.499 --> 37:30.876
[stammers]

37:33.587 --> 37:34.630
-Talk to me.
-All right.

37:34.713 --> 37:36.381
The happy couple's
about to stand up there.

37:36.465 --> 37:37.758
The ring bearer brings two rings

37:37.841 --> 37:40.135
that have been blessed by the hat guy
for them to exchange.

37:40.219 --> 37:41.553
But if they don't,

37:41.637 --> 37:43.680
it messes with the whole
"right place, right time"--

37:43.764 --> 37:45.307
-We steal the rings.
-I was about to say that.

37:45.390 --> 37:46.683
But you didn't. So it's my idea.

37:46.767 --> 37:49.603
Okay, well,
the ring bearer is Gede's cousin.

37:50.145 --> 37:51.939
[children chattering]

37:53.273 --> 37:54.274
Why me?

37:54.358 --> 37:55.817
The hard stuff was always your thing.

37:55.901 --> 37:59.071
My thing was taking out the garbage
and getting things off of high shelves.

37:59.154 --> 38:01.823
Not that high, really.
And flattery won't work.

38:01.907 --> 38:03.784
-But you'll do it anyway.
-Why?

38:03.867 --> 38:05.577
Because it was your idea.

38:10.499 --> 38:13.502
[children shouting, laughing]

38:15.879 --> 38:17.005
[Georgia] Hey, guys!

38:17.089 --> 38:19.383
[child]
Can you play a chasing game with us?

38:19.466 --> 38:20.884
Can I show you something first?

38:20.968 --> 38:21.969
Ah!

38:22.052 --> 38:24.054
Let me show you something.
'Cause, see, I'm from America,

38:24.137 --> 38:27.891
and in America,
we eat bananas a little differently.

38:27.975 --> 38:31.687
We slice them before we peel them.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.772
[children] Not true!

38:33.856 --> 38:35.065
Totally true!

38:36.149 --> 38:38.527
Here, I'll show you.
Come here. Come sit up here.

38:40.571 --> 38:43.073
All right. See this banana?
Totally normal-looking, right?

38:43.156 --> 38:44.741
-It's not cut on the outside.
-Not cut.

38:44.825 --> 38:47.578
All right. So, I want you to take it--
Here, put your bag down.

38:47.661 --> 38:49.204
You're gonna take it and peel it.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.836
[children] Whoa!

38:58.881 --> 39:00.132
That's how it's done.

39:01.717 --> 39:03.594
[children giggling]

39:06.263 --> 39:08.098
[Gede]
So the rings that we'll give each other

39:08.182 --> 39:11.977
have been blessed in the sacred water
of Pura Ulun Danu Batur.

39:13.478 --> 39:14.563
I do the hard stuff.

39:17.482 --> 39:19.651
Can't believe
they fell for the banana trick.

39:20.319 --> 39:22.279
It really kills you
that you haven't figured it out.

39:22.362 --> 39:23.280
Ah…

39:23.363 --> 39:25.657
Maybe we'll show them to you.
Uh, Ketut has them.

39:25.741 --> 39:26.742
Ketut?

39:26.825 --> 39:28.744
Here we go.

39:28.827 --> 39:29.828
[Gede] Hey!

39:30.913 --> 39:32.497
Can you show us the rings? Yeah?

39:34.458 --> 39:37.878
Hmm, where are the rings?
There's nothing in there.

39:37.961 --> 39:39.713
-Shh.
-[Gede] It's empty.

39:40.631 --> 39:42.257
-[sighs] It's gone.
-Okay.

39:42.341 --> 39:44.176
-[Georgia clears throat]
-[David] Mmm?

39:44.927 --> 39:46.720
[speaking Balinese]

39:46.803 --> 39:47.804
[whispers] Losi!

39:50.807 --> 39:51.892
What is he saying?

39:51.975 --> 39:53.810
-I wasn't listening.
-Cool.

39:55.395 --> 39:59.316
Uh, "We have to have the rings
for the circumstances to be right."

39:59.399 --> 40:00.400
Yeah.

40:01.485 --> 40:03.487
[Losi] Now no one knows what to do.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.113
And Ketut is crying.

40:05.197 --> 40:06.657
Ah…

40:06.740 --> 40:08.200
Hey, sweetie, it's okay.

40:08.283 --> 40:10.786
-Tell her it's gonna be okay.
-[Gede] It's not gonna be okay.

40:10.869 --> 40:13.038
Look, if we don't have the rings,
then we can't--

40:17.918 --> 40:19.378
You're right. It's not a problem.

40:19.461 --> 40:20.462
We'll find other rings.

40:20.546 --> 40:24.216
Yeah. Did you hear that? It's fine.
We'll just do it another day. It's okay.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.058
How do they look?

40:34.101 --> 40:35.561
I'll do the stretch thing.

40:35.644 --> 40:36.728
The classic.

40:37.771 --> 40:39.481
[groans]

40:41.108 --> 40:42.401
Disappointed.

40:42.484 --> 40:43.819
-That's good.
-Is it?

40:43.902 --> 40:44.903
What do you mean?

40:44.987 --> 40:47.030
I mean, our daughter looks like
her dog just died.

40:47.114 --> 40:49.032
I don't know if I feel great about that.

40:49.658 --> 40:51.869
-We're nearly there.
-Where?

40:52.536 --> 40:53.620
You'll see.

40:55.289 --> 40:56.874
[whispers] I think he knows.

40:56.957 --> 40:58.458
He doesn't know.

41:00.377 --> 41:02.087
-Okay.
-[engine stops]

41:02.671 --> 41:04.798
-Are they here?
-They're here.

41:04.882 --> 41:05.883
Who's here?

41:09.678 --> 41:11.597
[dolphin whistles]

41:11.680 --> 41:13.182
-[whispers] Dolphins.
-[chuckles]

41:14.683 --> 41:15.976
[whistling]

41:16.560 --> 41:17.561
Are you kidding?

41:17.644 --> 41:19.730
[chuckles] It gets better.

41:22.774 --> 41:23.775
What are you doing?

41:24.443 --> 41:25.777
Ah, don't be afraid, Mr. Cotton.

41:26.653 --> 41:27.654
I'm not afraid.

41:27.738 --> 41:29.323
-[Georgia] You are.
-No, I'm not.

41:29.907 --> 41:31.783
I'm not afraid. Whoo!

41:31.867 --> 41:32.910
[David] Hey!

41:33.827 --> 41:35.454
[dolphins whistle, click]

41:36.205 --> 41:37.956
Oh, my God. This is amazing!

41:39.958 --> 41:42.252
[whistling, clicking continues]

41:44.254 --> 41:45.839
[Georgia] Whoo!

41:46.924 --> 41:48.258
[laughing]

41:56.141 --> 41:57.142
[chuckles] Mom.

42:00.062 --> 42:01.897
[David] Hey, are you sure
they're not sharks?

42:01.980 --> 42:02.981
[Gede] They're not sharks.

42:03.065 --> 42:05.651
They might be working with the sharks,
you know, to get us.

42:05.734 --> 42:08.612
-Don't miss out. Come on. Get in.
-Come on. Don't be a chicken.

42:08.695 --> 42:10.113
-I'm not chicken.
-Come on, chicken.

42:10.197 --> 42:12.991
-Oh, stop it.
-You've turned chicken in your old age.

42:13.075 --> 42:14.451
-I'm chicken?
-[Georgia] Come on, David!

42:14.535 --> 42:16.495
-I'll show you chicken.
-[Georgia clucking]

42:16.578 --> 42:18.080
I'll go. Let's go!

42:18.163 --> 42:19.665
[shouts]

42:20.207 --> 42:21.416
[laughs]

42:22.251 --> 42:23.585
[whistling, clicking]

42:25.963 --> 42:27.673
-[screams]
-Ooh…

42:27.756 --> 42:29.550
Can't believe I got bit by a dolphin.

42:29.633 --> 42:30.968
-You were grazed.
-[David groans]

42:31.051 --> 42:33.220
-This has never happened before.
-Yeah.

42:33.303 --> 42:34.304
Dad?

42:34.388 --> 42:35.514
-Dad? Dad!
-[grunting, groaning]

42:35.597 --> 42:37.474
[Lily] Be careful with him. Does it hurt?

42:37.558 --> 42:39.893
I bet it was that crazy-looking one
with the smile.

42:39.977 --> 42:40.978
All dolphins smile.

42:41.061 --> 42:42.145
Now we know why.

42:42.229 --> 42:43.647
-It wasn't Gede's fault.
-Yeah.

42:43.730 --> 42:45.274
We know. These things happen.

42:45.357 --> 42:47.192
No, he did just say they don't.

42:47.276 --> 42:49.194
Georgia, can you please apply pressure?

42:49.278 --> 42:51.196
I'm gonna go grab some bandages.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.948
We wouldn't want you to lose your leg.

42:53.031 --> 42:54.324
What?

42:54.408 --> 42:56.326
Enough things
have already been lost today.

42:59.454 --> 43:00.622
Oh, yeah. He knows.

43:01.665 --> 43:03.292
-Does it hurt when I do that?
-What's wrong with you?

43:03.375 --> 43:05.669
-He said, "Pressure. Georgia, pressure."
-Stop! [groans]

43:08.255 --> 43:09.631
[Lily] It's like I looked up and realized

43:09.715 --> 43:12.176
that everything I ever wanted
was right in front of me.

43:12.759 --> 43:15.262
I mean, I could go back
and try and make a go of it,

43:15.345 --> 43:19.266
but I just know that every second
I'd be dreaming of being here…

43:21.143 --> 43:22.144
with him.

43:23.061 --> 43:25.772
You know, it's like you always say,
why save the good stuff for later?

43:27.441 --> 43:29.193
Yeah, I do.

43:31.111 --> 43:32.196
I do.

43:32.279 --> 43:35.032
Excuse me. I'd like to get these.

43:35.115 --> 43:36.200
You're tourists, yes?

43:36.283 --> 43:39.119
Uh, well, she is, but I live here now.

43:40.078 --> 43:42.039
Ah, then we haggle.

43:42.122 --> 43:45.501
Oh. Uh, no, we don't need to haggle.
Just give me a fair price.

43:46.376 --> 43:47.836
Tourists like it when we haggle.

43:47.920 --> 43:49.963
Americans like make good deals.

43:50.047 --> 43:52.132
800,000 rupiah?

43:52.216 --> 43:53.509
Okay.

43:53.592 --> 43:56.178
[whispers] No, no. You say 500,000.

43:58.138 --> 43:59.264
Just go with it, Mom.

44:00.015 --> 44:02.601
Um… 500,000.

44:02.684 --> 44:05.395
Enough, please. You're killing me.
Seven.

44:05.479 --> 44:07.481
Six. Or I'm walking away.

44:07.564 --> 44:09.274
We have a deal. [chuckles]

44:10.275 --> 44:11.318
Thank you.

44:12.194 --> 44:14.905
[sighs]
I'm just so crazy grateful for you, Mom.

44:14.988 --> 44:16.573
There's no need.

44:16.657 --> 44:18.075
Yes, there is.

44:18.158 --> 44:20.410
This is the biggest decision
I've ever made in my life.

44:20.494 --> 44:22.871
You came halfway around the world
to have my back.

44:25.040 --> 44:28.502
[sighs] You are a very kind woman.
Thank you.

44:29.419 --> 44:31.046
I'm really not. I--

44:34.424 --> 44:37.010
I don't know what this is, but I like it.

44:37.094 --> 44:38.679
Yeah, it's called a martabak.

44:39.429 --> 44:40.430
Martabak?

44:41.557 --> 44:44.434
Listen, um,
Lily and I will get other rings,

44:44.518 --> 44:46.854
but it would be much better
if you just give them back.

44:46.937 --> 44:49.022
What are you talking about?
I don't have your rings.

44:49.106 --> 44:51.900
[chuckles] I didn't say anything
to Lily, and I won't.

44:51.984 --> 44:54.278
But, Mr. Cotton, I need you and Georgia
to stop now, please.

44:54.361 --> 44:55.279
You know what I think?

44:55.362 --> 44:58.532
You didn't say anything to Lily because
you're afraid she might be having doubts.

44:58.615 --> 44:59.825
And if you did say something,

44:59.908 --> 45:02.494
she might listen to those doubts.
Or worse, she might act on them.

45:02.578 --> 45:05.163
I haven't told Lily because I know
it would hurt her very much to know

45:05.247 --> 45:07.082
the reason her parents
are finally getting along

45:07.165 --> 45:09.251
is because they're united
to sabotage her relationship.

45:09.334 --> 45:11.211
If anyone here is afraid, it's you.

45:12.588 --> 45:14.339
I'm not here
to steal your daughter from you.

45:14.423 --> 45:15.716
That's the last thing I want to do.

45:15.799 --> 45:17.885
She's not a competition to be won or lost.

45:19.344 --> 45:20.512
Look, trust me.

45:20.596 --> 45:22.973
If Lily finds out
what you two are really doing,

45:23.056 --> 45:24.558
you'll most certainly lose her then.

45:26.476 --> 45:27.686
Enjoy your martabak.

45:33.233 --> 45:36.403
[Georgia] Remind me, were the guys
in the Trojan horse the good guys?

45:36.486 --> 45:37.905
Good or bad, they won the war.

45:37.988 --> 45:39.364
And what was the war about exactly?

45:39.448 --> 45:41.241
-Don't do this, Georgia.
-Do you think we're wrong?

45:41.325 --> 45:43.118
-We're not wrong.
-I think we might be wrong.

45:43.202 --> 45:46.038
Remember when we agreed
to do this together? To be in lockstep?

45:46.121 --> 45:48.957
Yeah, but that was before we saw her.
Saw them.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.417
You know-- [groans]

45:50.501 --> 45:53.003
Great. Classic. You win again.

45:53.086 --> 45:54.254
What does that even mean?

45:54.338 --> 45:56.882
You know what? I had Lily one day a week
and every other weekend.

45:56.965 --> 45:59.134
You had her all the rest of the time.

45:59.218 --> 46:01.386
She listened to you, she relied on you,

46:01.470 --> 46:04.348
and now you get to be the one
that gives her everything she wants.

46:04.431 --> 46:06.099
I never get to give her what she wants.

46:06.183 --> 46:08.852
Yes, I was there for her.
To make the rules, to fight with.

46:08.936 --> 46:11.522
You were fun Dad. You would breeze in,
take her where she wanted to go,

46:11.605 --> 46:13.357
buy her anything she wanted,
then drop her off.

46:13.440 --> 46:15.317
-I didn't want that.
-Then you shouldn't have left.

46:15.400 --> 46:16.652
-I had to. It was over.
-Why?

46:16.735 --> 46:18.695
-Because the house burned down?
-You didn't love me anymore.

46:18.779 --> 46:20.489
-You didn't like me.
-You didn't have respect for me.

46:20.572 --> 46:23.659
-You've never had any respect for me.
-That is so unbelievably untrue.

46:23.742 --> 46:25.661
When you proposed,
did you really want to get married

46:25.744 --> 46:27.538
or you just didn't want me
to take that job in LA?

46:27.621 --> 46:29.540
I wanted to be happy.
I wanted you to be happy.

46:29.623 --> 46:31.416
-Well, I am happy now.
-Good. So am I.

46:31.500 --> 46:32.501

-Great.

for you guys.

with your wound.

48:02.466 --> 48:04.384
She listened to you. Always.

48:06.470 --> 48:07.471
What?

48:08.096 --> 48:09.431
She still does.

48:09.515 --> 48:12.559
She never needed to make me as happy
as she wanted to make you.

48:16.146 --> 48:18.899
She's just so like you.

48:18.982 --> 48:21.652
[chuckles]
I think she's so like you.

48:27.074 --> 48:29.117
Um, and I'll tell you something else.

48:29.201 --> 48:32.955
I'm looking at your pile of seaweed
and at mine,

48:33.038 --> 48:35.249

it's totally not a competition.

48:35.332 --> 48:37.918
But if it was… [clears throat]

48:39.044 --> 48:40.170

-That was mine.

That was mine. You took mine.

it wasn't a competition, right?

teeth takes us away from the animals,

55:12.354 --> 55:13.814
I was overserved.

55:17.484 --> 55:19.903
I need some lemon water
and some bacon.

55:20.904 --> 55:22.155
I like bacon.

55:23.490 --> 55:24.783
[gasps]

55:26.243 --> 55:28.287
-What are you doing in my bed?
-What are you doing in my boxers?

55:28.370 --> 55:30.330
-What are you doing in my shirt?
-Give me back my underwear.

55:30.414 --> 55:31.790
Where are my underwear?

55:33.125 --> 55:34.126
Not here.

55:34.209 --> 55:35.252
Oh, thank God.

55:35.335 --> 55:36.420
Not really. I'm naked.

55:36.503 --> 55:38.255
Oh, my God! What did we do?

55:38.338 --> 55:39.840
Nothing. We didn't do anything.

55:39.923 --> 55:42.509
-We were so drunk.
-I think I still am. I gotta pee.

55:42.593 --> 55:45.137
No, don't get out of the bed.
Nakedness. Nakedness.

55:45.220 --> 55:47.222
-All right, give me something to wear.
-[grunts]

55:47.806 --> 55:49.183
Oh, my God.

55:49.266 --> 55:50.434
Oh, Jesus.

55:53.020 --> 55:54.313
Oh, that's what it was.

55:54.396 --> 55:56.398
You went skinny-dipping in the pool
last night.

55:56.481 --> 55:57.983
So we didn't do anything.

55:58.066 --> 56:00.277
There's not enough alcohol
in the world.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.695
These aren't gonna fit.

56:01.778 --> 56:05.199
-They're stretchy, trust me.
-[knocks on door]

56:05.282 --> 56:06.825
Lily again.

56:06.909 --> 56:08.160
[groans]

56:08.243 --> 56:09.828
Why does our daughter love us?

56:09.912 --> 56:12.706
-She can't see us like this.
-No one can see us like this.

56:12.789 --> 56:13.874
[Paul] Georgia, my love.

56:13.957 --> 56:15.626
-That's Paul. That's my boyfriend.
-What?

56:15.709 --> 56:17.544
Did you tell him
you don't like surprises?

56:17.628 --> 56:20.756
He surprises me so much. It's almost
not a surprise when he surprises me.

56:20.839 --> 56:23.509
-Georgia? It's me. It's Paul.
-Okay. Wait.

56:23.592 --> 56:25.969
-I'm sneaking around. Distract him.
-What? What?

56:26.053 --> 56:27.596
-Distract him!
-[David] You distract him!

56:27.679 --> 56:29.473
-[Paul] Georgia, open the door.
-Fuck!

56:30.891 --> 56:31.892
Hey, Paul.

56:31.975 --> 56:34.937
-David. I thought this was--
-Georgia's room?

56:35.020 --> 56:36.897
-Yeah.
-No. It's my room. That's her room.

56:36.980 --> 56:39.024
This is my room.
Hi, sweetie. I thought I heard you.

56:39.107 --> 56:40.484
-In that room.
-Which is my room.

56:40.567 --> 56:42.027
But, I thought the guy said--

56:42.110 --> 56:43.987
-No, we changed rooms.
-So this could be my room.

56:44.071 --> 56:45.447
It's a much better room.

56:46.031 --> 56:47.282
-Yeah.
-Oh, great. Can I see it?

56:47.366 --> 56:48.367
Yes. But first--

56:48.450 --> 56:52.246
Baby, do you mind? Could you just get me
a great big bucket of coffee?

56:52.329 --> 56:54.790
-[Paul] Yeah, yeah. Anything for you.
-[Georgia chuckles]

56:58.001 --> 56:59.169
You've been doing yoga?

57:00.796 --> 57:02.548
No, I just like the pants.

57:03.298 --> 57:04.424
Huh.

57:07.386 --> 57:08.595
[David sighs]

57:09.304 --> 57:10.973
Quick, we're changing rooms!

57:11.598 --> 57:13.517
Oh! Shit.

57:15.352 --> 57:16.353
Okay.

57:17.271 --> 57:19.481
[Paul] If I had hesitated just one second,

57:21.024 --> 57:24.361
well, let's just say there's 170 souls
that are lucky I didn't.

57:25.112 --> 57:26.238
And me.

57:26.321 --> 57:27.656
So 171?

57:27.739 --> 57:30.617
-Hey. Where have you guys been?
-[Georgia] Did you see Paul's here?

57:30.701 --> 57:32.995
-He's literally standing right next to us.
-What's the plan?

57:33.078 --> 57:36.456
Uh, I was thinking we could visit
the island of Nusa Penida.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.959
-Best place on earth to watch a sunset.
-That sounds great.

57:39.042 --> 57:43.547
Now, I've been reading in the guidebooks
about visiting the temple at Tanah Lot?

57:43.630 --> 57:45.007
-I don't think that's--
-Cool.

57:45.090 --> 57:48.886
Okay, why don't I get us some cabs? Okay?
Get us a couple of cabs.

57:48.969 --> 57:50.804
I think Nusa Penida would be better.

57:50.888 --> 57:53.307
We'll do that right after Tanah Lot.
Okay?

57:54.892 --> 57:56.185
Hi!

57:56.268 --> 57:59.271
Hey, do you know where Tanah Lot is?
It's a temple, apparently.

57:59.897 --> 58:02.983
[claps] Here we go, guys.
Come on. Come on!

58:22.836 --> 58:24.087
[Lily] You okay?

58:24.171 --> 58:25.380
We shouldn't be here.

58:26.131 --> 58:28.800
Why? Looks amazing.

58:30.010 --> 58:31.470
It's cursed.

58:31.553 --> 58:34.556
Tradition says any unwed couple
that visits Tanah Lot

58:34.640 --> 58:36.517
will never have happiness in marriage.

58:38.602 --> 58:40.354
Well, my dad couldn't have known that.

58:41.647 --> 58:42.773
I'm sure you're right.

58:43.982 --> 58:46.235
Well, hey, let's just go.

58:47.528 --> 58:48.570
-You sure?
-Yeah.

58:50.030 --> 58:52.533
But it would take a lot more
than a curse to mess us up.

58:53.825 --> 58:55.702
Maybe other couples weren't so lucky.

59:08.966 --> 59:11.093
[Paul] Apparently, these are called
the snake caves.

59:11.176 --> 59:13.595
Oh, my God.
It feels so good to get out of the sun.

59:14.513 --> 59:16.557
Feel like my hangover has a hangover.

59:17.266 --> 59:18.475
[sighs]

59:20.435 --> 59:21.436
What are you doing?

59:22.062 --> 59:23.146
Georgia?

59:23.730 --> 59:24.690
Yes?

59:24.773 --> 59:26.108
I love you.

59:27.109 --> 59:30.654
You are gorgeous and kind.

59:30.737 --> 59:31.864
[groans]

59:31.947 --> 59:33.323
Funny and smart.

59:33.407 --> 59:35.117
You're everything I could ever want
and need.

59:36.118 --> 59:37.119
Will you marry me?

59:37.202 --> 59:39.079
[laughs]

59:39.162 --> 59:40.163
Oh…

59:40.247 --> 59:41.915
Whoa, Paul, I'm so--

59:43.166 --> 59:44.376
I'm so touched and--

59:45.210 --> 59:46.461
and nauseous right now.

59:47.129 --> 59:48.297
Um…

59:49.756 --> 59:51.383
Uh…

59:51.466 --> 59:52.718
How do I put this?

59:52.801 --> 59:54.011
Um, David--

59:55.846 --> 59:57.973
David spent the night in my room
last night.

59:59.183 --> 1:00:00.184
I'm sorry.

1:00:04.563 --> 1:00:06.064
[sighs]

1:00:06.148 --> 1:00:07.357
I know. [chuckles]

1:00:07.441 --> 1:00:08.692
Oh.

1:00:09.276 --> 1:00:12.321
Men don't wear yoga pants.
Even when they do yoga.

1:00:12.404 --> 1:00:15.365
Oh, okay. I mean,
oh, my God, nothing happened.

1:00:15.449 --> 1:00:17.701
It's not like that.
It would just never be like that.

1:00:17.784 --> 1:00:19.328
-Stop it. Stop it.
-Okay? Okay.

1:00:19.995 --> 1:00:22.164
-I trust you.
-Okay. Thank you.

1:00:23.123 --> 1:00:24.291
Thank you. [chuckles]

1:00:25.209 --> 1:00:26.210
I--

1:00:27.794 --> 1:00:30.380
[slurring] I trust you.

1:00:30.464 --> 1:00:32.424
Yeah. Thank you.

1:00:32.508 --> 1:00:34.301
[chuckles]

1:00:34.384 --> 1:00:35.802
Why are you being weird?

1:00:35.886 --> 1:00:38.430
[slurring]
I think maybe I just got bit by something.

1:00:38.514 --> 1:00:40.724
-Really?
-Oh, a snake!

1:00:40.807 --> 1:00:42.476
[Georgia screams]

1:00:43.644 --> 1:00:45.103
Ah, that's no good.

1:00:45.687 --> 1:00:47.773
-Oh, shit.
-[groaning]

1:00:47.856 --> 1:00:49.900
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. [shouts]

1:00:49.983 --> 1:00:51.193
-It's wet.
-Where is it?

1:00:51.276 --> 1:00:53.987
Oh, my God, there it is.
Um, what do we do?

1:00:54.071 --> 1:00:56.073
-What do we do?
-Do something.

1:00:56.156 --> 1:00:57.991
Okay. Um…

1:00:58.075 --> 1:00:59.076
Anything.

1:00:59.868 --> 1:01:01.161
-[groans]
-Okay.

1:01:06.208 --> 1:01:07.793
[grunts, spits]

1:01:08.544 --> 1:01:09.545
You're amazing.

1:01:10.170 --> 1:01:12.506
I think-- I think I got most of it.

1:01:14.007 --> 1:01:15.634
I think I got most of it.

1:01:17.761 --> 1:01:20.931
Well, he will experience
some numbness in his extremities

1:01:21.014 --> 1:01:23.809
and a little wooziness
from the pills I just gave him,

1:01:23.892 --> 1:01:25.811
but no lasting effect.

1:01:25.894 --> 1:01:27.521
Not like getting bit by a dolphin.

1:01:27.604 --> 1:01:28.605
All right.

1:01:29.314 --> 1:01:30.607
You saved my life.

1:01:31.733 --> 1:01:32.734
I really didn't.

1:01:33.235 --> 1:01:35.904
We just heard.
What an adventure.

1:01:36.655 --> 1:01:37.948
-Are you okay?
-[Paul] I'm okay.

1:01:38.532 --> 1:01:39.950
Thanks to my warrior queen.

1:01:40.033 --> 1:01:42.411
-My Georgia. [chuckles]
-Okay.

1:01:42.494 --> 1:01:44.454
[in Balinese]

1:01:49.293 --> 1:01:51.336
-What are you talking about?
-Hmm?

1:01:51.879 --> 1:01:52.880
Snakes.

1:01:53.547 --> 1:01:54.798
Hmm.

1:01:54.882 --> 1:01:56.008
[Losi] We should let him sleep.

1:01:56.091 --> 1:01:58.802
He's going to be fine,
but don't do that again.

1:01:59.511 --> 1:02:01.096
-[David] All right.
-[Gede] Let's go.

1:02:01.180 --> 1:02:02.431
-Okay.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1:02:02.514 --> 1:02:06.018
We'll let you get some rest, okay?
But don't worry. I'll stay right here.

1:02:06.101 --> 1:02:09.313
Oh, oh, oh. You remember
that important thing that I asked you?

1:02:09.396 --> 1:02:10.898
Oh, yeah. Yep.

1:02:12.065 --> 1:02:13.358
What did he ask you?

1:02:14.276 --> 1:02:15.277
To marry him.

1:02:17.196 --> 1:02:18.197
That's wonderful.

1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:19.323
What?

1:02:19.406 --> 1:02:21.408
Maybe not for everybody.

1:02:21.491 --> 1:02:23.243
Sorry, I get that he's nice and all, but--

1:02:23.327 --> 1:02:24.578
What's wrong with nice?

1:02:25.662 --> 1:02:26.788
Uh…

1:02:26.872 --> 1:02:30.042
Only that after a couple more years of it,
you'll be begging to watch paint dry.

1:02:30.125 --> 1:02:31.418
Excuse me?

1:02:31.502 --> 1:02:35.923
I mean, Mom, you're so amazing
and educated, tough, smart and beautiful.

1:02:36.006 --> 1:02:38.342
But you're never your best self with him.

1:02:38.425 --> 1:02:43.305
Yeah, he's kind and he's got those eyes.
But it's not enough.

1:02:45.766 --> 1:02:48.310
Being loved is not the same as loving.

1:02:50.062 --> 1:02:53.148
Plus, the whole surprising thing?
[chuckles]

1:02:54.066 --> 1:02:57.653
[Paul] It's actually just a curtain
between us, so I heard all of that.

1:03:18.298 --> 1:03:19.424
I feel bad.

1:03:21.134 --> 1:03:23.387
Well, she didn't say she said yes.

1:03:26.348 --> 1:03:27.808
How would you feel if she did?

1:03:29.810 --> 1:03:33.355
Like hearing an old friend you barely
talk to anymore is getting married.

1:03:34.064 --> 1:03:37.985
You're happy for them,
but you don't feel the need to buy a gift.

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:42.281
Since when were you guys old friends?

1:03:44.741 --> 1:03:45.742
Ah…

1:03:46.326 --> 1:03:48.036
That's the way it goes.

1:03:48.120 --> 1:03:49.162
Stuff happens.

1:03:50.455 --> 1:03:52.416
Things change and you move on.

1:03:56.837 --> 1:03:58.005
Just move on.

1:04:10.809 --> 1:04:13.812
She doesn't get to tell me what to do.
Can you believe it?

1:04:13.896 --> 1:04:17.191
I'm sorry, baby. I'm a little woozy.
Am I supposed to believe it?

1:04:17.274 --> 1:04:18.275
[Georgia] No.

1:04:18.358 --> 1:04:19.735
No. Right, I can't.

1:04:19.818 --> 1:04:22.529
-I know you're thinking I'm a hypocrite.
-Am I?

1:04:22.613 --> 1:04:24.239
And you're probably right.

1:04:24.323 --> 1:04:25.407
Oh, good.

1:04:25.490 --> 1:04:29.036
I mean, who are we to say that
Lily doesn't know what's best for herself?

1:04:29.119 --> 1:04:30.120
And if she does,

1:04:30.204 --> 1:04:33.665
if she's truly definitively certain
that she loves and is loved, then--

1:04:33.749 --> 1:04:35.751
Oh, David is with them. [groans]

1:04:35.834 --> 1:04:37.419
David is with Gede and Lily now.

1:04:37.503 --> 1:04:40.797
-Oh. Right, so he can break them up.
-No. I don't want him to break them up.

1:04:40.881 --> 1:04:42.257
-Damn this medication.
-[scoffs]

1:04:43.550 --> 1:04:45.135
I have to do something.

1:04:45.219 --> 1:04:46.261
Take this.

1:04:46.887 --> 1:04:48.514
[coughs]

1:04:48.597 --> 1:04:50.265
I'm sorry. This will help you sleep.

1:04:50.349 --> 1:04:51.683
[slurping]

1:04:51.767 --> 1:04:54.061
-All right. Cool. Feel better.
-[coughs]

1:04:54.144 --> 1:04:56.897
You know,
I'm a highly trained commercial pilot.

1:04:56.980 --> 1:04:59.024
I can go weeks without sleep.

1:05:16.625 --> 1:05:18.377
[Lily] The best place on earth.

1:05:18.460 --> 1:05:22.589
[chuckles] Well, to be fair,
I haven't been to all the other places.

1:05:22.673 --> 1:05:24.883
Your mother is gonna be so jealous.

1:05:24.967 --> 1:05:27.594
I'll send her a picture
as soon as I get a signal.

1:05:27.678 --> 1:05:28.679
[Georgia] No need.

1:05:35.769 --> 1:05:36.770
[Lily] Mom!

1:05:37.479 --> 1:05:38.856
Hey.

1:05:38.939 --> 1:05:42.526
Hey, I'm so sorry about before.
I guess I was just surprised.

1:05:42.609 --> 1:05:44.319
Of course your choices
are your choices.

1:05:44.403 --> 1:05:47.239
Well, I haven't made any choices yet.

1:05:47.990 --> 1:05:48.991
[Lily] Oh.

1:05:50.284 --> 1:05:51.285
Okay.

1:05:51.368 --> 1:05:52.995
-[Georgia] Hi, gents.
-Hey.

1:05:53.078 --> 1:05:54.329
Is, uh, Paul okay?

1:05:54.413 --> 1:05:55.539
He's sleeping.

1:05:55.622 --> 1:05:56.623
How can you tell?

1:05:57.624 --> 1:05:59.334
God, look at this view.

1:06:01.003 --> 1:06:02.004
Yeah.

1:06:05.007 --> 1:06:06.091
Is that my boat?

1:06:08.760 --> 1:06:09.761
[Lily] Is it drifting?

1:06:11.263 --> 1:06:13.640
Nah, it's just rising with the tide.

1:06:13.724 --> 1:06:14.808
It's floating away.

1:06:14.892 --> 1:06:16.143
You did tie my boat up?

1:06:16.226 --> 1:06:18.061
Yeah, I tied it. Tied it to a log.

1:06:21.857 --> 1:06:23.150
That's not good.

1:06:26.069 --> 1:06:28.030
[birds chirping]

1:06:28.655 --> 1:06:30.574
[David] How far are we
from the nearest village?

1:06:30.657 --> 1:06:33.452
[Gede] Too far to walk.
Plus, it's getting dark.

1:06:33.535 --> 1:06:35.245
[Georgia] I still can't get a signal.

1:06:35.787 --> 1:06:37.206
[Lily] What are we gonna do?

1:06:37.289 --> 1:06:39.166
[Gede] Camp here for the night.

1:06:39.249 --> 1:06:41.418
A lot of people come to see the sunrise,

1:06:41.502 --> 1:06:43.754
so we can get a ride
in time for our wedding.

1:06:43.837 --> 1:06:46.590
-[Lily] Is that gonna work?
-Yeah, with hours to spare.

1:06:47.382 --> 1:06:50.010
Uh, Georgia,
can you and Lily build a fire?

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:51.094
On it, yeah.

1:06:51.178 --> 1:06:54.014
Mr. Cotton,
you and I will track down some food.

1:06:54.097 --> 1:06:55.682
Hmm. What kind of food?

1:06:55.766 --> 1:06:57.643
I've seen some wild pigs around.

1:06:59.311 --> 1:07:01.271
-[chuckles]
-We'll have to make spears.

1:07:01.355 --> 1:07:03.148
[laughing]

1:07:03.232 --> 1:07:05.526
What? I can hunt. I can be a hunter.

1:07:05.609 --> 1:07:08.195
How do you make that part pointier?

1:07:09.321 --> 1:07:12.074
-I am impressed with this situation…
-Yeah.

1:07:12.157 --> 1:07:14.493
-…and I have, uh, matches in my bag.
-Okay.

1:07:15.619 --> 1:07:19.164
You know, I don't think I've actually
successfully started a fire before.

1:07:19.248 --> 1:07:21.667
Oh, really? What about
your eighth birthday, hmm?

1:07:21.750 --> 1:07:24.378
Uh, well, never on purpose.
[chuckles]

1:07:24.461 --> 1:07:26.797
Oh, God,
we had some good parties.

1:07:26.880 --> 1:07:28.423
Do you remember
your tenth birthday?

1:07:28.507 --> 1:07:30.217
-The clown came and he was drunk?
-Mom?

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:32.553
-No, he was a magician. But he was--
-Mom.

1:07:42.104 --> 1:07:44.398
[snorting]

1:07:47.776 --> 1:07:49.778
[whispers]
All right. You're the closest.

1:07:50.404 --> 1:07:52.239
I think it's closer to you than me.

1:07:53.532 --> 1:07:54.575
Okay. Hey.

1:07:55.784 --> 1:07:57.744
-On my count. Okay?
-Okay.

-[Lily] Dad!
-[pig squealing]

1:08:07.880 --> 1:08:10.257
What are you doing?
We absolutely had it!

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:11.383
I cannot believe you.

1:08:11.466 --> 1:08:13.927
-You're the one that scared it away.
-That's not what I'm talking about.

1:08:14.011 --> 1:08:15.888
-What are you talking about?
-She found the rings.

1:08:16.889 --> 1:08:17.890
Really?

1:08:17.973 --> 1:08:19.183
That's great. Where? [chuckles]

1:08:19.265 --> 1:08:20.392
In Mom's bag.

1:08:21.185 --> 1:08:22.685
-I knew it.
-What?

1:08:23.687 --> 1:08:25.856
-I knew it.
-She wasn't working alone because--

1:08:26.857 --> 1:08:28.649
-Wait, what?
-You left it in the bag?

1:08:28.734 --> 1:08:31.236
-What do you mean you knew?
-What was I to do with them?

1:08:31.319 --> 1:08:33.113
-Throw it away.
-I'm sorry. I couldn't tell you.

1:08:33.197 --> 1:08:34.406
-Where?
-In the trash, ocean, anywhere.

1:08:34.488 --> 1:08:36.825
-Oh, my God.
-Can you stop talking about the rings?

1:08:36.908 --> 1:08:38.202
I can't believe this is happening.

1:08:38.285 --> 1:08:40.328
My parents have been
trying to sabotage my wedding.

1:08:40.412 --> 1:08:42.331
My fiancé knew about it
and didn't bother to tell me.

1:08:42.413 --> 1:08:43.916
We're just trying to do
what's best for you.

1:08:43.999 --> 1:08:47.377
Yeah, but you had no respect
for my opinion of what that might be.

1:08:49.587 --> 1:08:52.966
You're just like all parents,
acting like you're giving your kid

1:08:53.050 --> 1:08:55.594
this great advice for their own good,
but all you're really doing

1:08:55.676 --> 1:08:58.138
is talking to your young, dumb selves,
trying to rewrite the past

1:08:58.221 --> 1:09:00.224
and not do whatever you did
25 years ago.

1:09:00.307 --> 1:09:02.350
-That's absolutely not true.
-That's 100% true.

1:09:04.102 --> 1:09:07.439
And I can't tell you
how much I wish

1:09:07.523 --> 1:09:09.733
someone had been able to
get through to me back then.

1:09:11.359 --> 1:09:13.862
Stop me from making
the greatest mistake of my life.

1:09:17.282 --> 1:09:18.951
I'm the greatest mistake of your life?

1:09:20.493 --> 1:09:22.621
-Not you. Me.
-[thunder rumbling]

1:09:23.830 --> 1:09:24.915

1:09:49.814 --> 1:09:51.108

1:09:52.234 --> 1:09:53.569
Do you think we've lost her?

1:09:56.238 --> 1:09:57.406
She's pretty pissed.

1:10:01.702 --> 1:10:04.162
I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her it was my idea.

1:10:05.455 --> 1:10:06.707
I talked you into it.

1:10:08.333 --> 1:10:11.420
And if I'd listened to you,
we wouldn't have done it.

1:10:12.629 --> 1:10:14.506
-[thunder rumbling]
-She'll be fine.

1:10:21.471 --> 1:10:24.183
-You weren't a mistake.
-[rumbling continues]

1:10:25.684 --> 1:10:26.727
You weren't.

1:10:28.228 --> 1:10:31.899
It's been the story for years that you
were the one to blame. It's not true.

1:10:35.861 --> 1:10:40.282
I was loving being a mom.

1:10:43.285 --> 1:10:47.789
But I started to feel like
I was losing who I was,

1:10:47.873 --> 1:10:51.043
and I thought if I'd stayed with you,

1:10:51.126 --> 1:10:55.464
maybe one day
I would not recognize myself at all.

1:10:58.008 --> 1:11:00.469
[thunder rumbling]

1:11:00.552 --> 1:11:02.054
That was the mistake.

1:11:03.096 --> 1:11:04.097
Not you.

1:11:16.401 --> 1:11:17.778
[Lily] You should've told me.

1:11:19.738 --> 1:11:22.699
[Gede] Well, your dad thinks
you deserve better than me.

1:11:23.742 --> 1:11:25.869
My dad thinks
I deserve better than anyone.

1:11:26.495 --> 1:11:27.496
So do I.

1:11:30.916 --> 1:11:34.336
You gave up a lot
to stay on this island.

1:11:35.671 --> 1:11:37.256
And you know I understand that.

1:11:39.675 --> 1:11:41.426
But what about me?

1:11:42.886 --> 1:11:45.973
In a year from now,
ten years from now…

1:11:48.100 --> 1:11:49.560
will I still be enough for you?

1:11:52.354 --> 1:11:53.480
Are you kidding me?

1:11:55.899 --> 1:11:57.401
[chuckles]

1:11:57.484 --> 1:12:01.530
Hey, we're sitting here,
and there's a moon and a waterfall.

1:12:01.613 --> 1:12:04.032
I'm in the most beautiful place
I've ever been in my life,

1:12:04.116 --> 1:12:05.826
and all I can look at is you.

1:12:09.371 --> 1:12:13.250
[sighs] This isn't some summer thing
with a beginning and an end.

1:12:15.752 --> 1:12:17.087
This is forever.

1:12:49.036 --> 1:12:50.537
[Georgia] Morning.

1:12:50.621 --> 1:12:51.622
Morning.

1:12:51.705 --> 1:12:53.415
[Georgia] How'd you sleep?

1:12:53.498 --> 1:12:55.459
[David] You know. Outside.

1:12:58.212 --> 1:13:00.881
[Georgia] I think this is
my new favorite place on earth.

1:13:02.758 --> 1:13:04.176
Close second, for me.

1:13:04.259 --> 1:13:06.553
Yeah? What beats it?

1:13:08.138 --> 1:13:10.098
Hmm? Aw.

-Yeah.

1:13:11.725 --> 1:13:12.726
Yeah.

I still go there from time to time.

1:13:15.187 --> 1:13:16.313
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1:13:16.897 --> 1:13:20.734
God, what did they build there?
Please don't say some hideous McMansion.

1:13:20.817 --> 1:13:22.528
Nah, it's still vacant.

1:13:22.611 --> 1:13:23.654
Huh.

1:13:23.737 --> 1:13:25.572
I wonder why nobody ever developed it.

1:13:27.574 --> 1:13:28.909
'Cause I still own it.

1:13:33.539 --> 1:13:34.706
I meant to sell it.

I just--

-Oh, no. No. No! [laughs]
-No, no. No. [laughs]

1:14:23.922 --> 1:14:26.049
-Just-- Yeah, that would not work.
-Nope. No, no.

1:14:26.133 --> 1:14:28.177
-That's bad. [laughing]
-That's not gonna work.

1:14:28.260 --> 1:14:29.803
It's because we're
in this romantic place.

1:14:29.887 --> 1:14:32.306
-No, the thing with Lily is just--
-Everything is heightened.

1:14:32.389 --> 1:14:33.682
-Maybe if we were younger--
-We're not.

1:14:33.765 --> 1:14:36.560
-Which we're not. We know better! Great!
-So, good, good, good.

1:17:51.880 --> 1:17:53.340
Why would I cry?

1:17:54.132 --> 1:17:55.717
It's not like I'm losing someone

1:17:55.801 --> 1:17:59.096
who's basically a substitute
for my entire terrible family.

1:18:00.973 --> 1:18:02.182
Is my mascara okay?

1:18:03.183 --> 1:18:06.645
Uh, for a clown. Let me help.

1:18:08.689 --> 1:18:11.024
-[sighs]
-Do you remember when we graduated?

1:18:11.108 --> 1:18:13.819
Yes, because it was two months ago.

1:18:13.902 --> 1:18:15.279
-Oh…
-[laughs]

1:18:15.362 --> 1:18:16.738
[knocking on door]

1:18:18.115 --> 1:18:22.160
Mrs. C? You're gonna have
to take it from here.

1:18:22.244 --> 1:18:23.328
I just can't.

1:18:30.002 --> 1:18:31.128
Hi.

1:18:31.879 --> 1:18:32.880
Hi.

1:18:39.303 --> 1:18:40.512
[sniffles]

1:18:41.388 --> 1:18:42.389
May I?

1:18:50.439 --> 1:18:51.773
You lied to me.

1:18:56.028 --> 1:18:57.863
I'm so, so sorry.

1:18:57.946 --> 1:18:59.239
[sighs]

1:18:59.823 --> 1:19:03.535
It turns out a parent will do
anything in the world for their kid,

1:19:03.619 --> 1:19:05.662
except let them be
exactly who they are.

1:19:08.498 --> 1:19:10.834
Your dad and I
were gonna be different.

1:19:13.712 --> 1:19:15.714
We were gonna be better than this.

1:19:18.091 --> 1:19:20.010
I wanted to be better than this.

1:19:25.849 --> 1:19:27.476
There's no one better, Mom.

1:19:30.312 --> 1:19:31.355
No one.

1:19:32.940 --> 1:19:34.358
Yes, there is.

1:19:39.488 --> 1:19:40.948
[chuckles]

1:19:43.450 --> 1:19:45.327
-Sweetie. Love you.
-[crying]

1:19:47.287 --> 1:19:48.747
[Lily sniffles]

1:19:53.085 --> 1:19:54.878
Got to get you ready
for that wedding, huh?

1:19:54.962 --> 1:19:56.213
Yeah. [laughs]

1:19:56.296 --> 1:19:59.007
-You're kind of a mess right now.
-I know, Mom.

1:20:03.095 --> 1:20:04.888
You're a mess. You're my mess.

1:20:12.437 --> 1:20:16.108
[Suli, in Balinese]

1:20:18.318 --> 1:20:19.903
[in Balinese]

1:20:32.958 --> 1:20:34.334
[chuckles]

1:20:34.418 --> 1:20:37.212
[in Balinese]

1:20:39.173 --> 1:20:40.174
[both laugh]

1:21:01.403 --> 1:21:02.696
[chuckles]

1:21:11.955 --> 1:21:14.750
Can you believe I didn't
bring anything to wear to a wedding?

1:21:14.833 --> 1:21:16.710
There wasn't supposed to be a wedding.

1:21:18.545 --> 1:21:19.880
Doesn't look like a rental.

1:21:21.882 --> 1:21:23.300
You clean up pretty good.

1:21:30.432 --> 1:21:31.433
[sighs]

1:21:32.267 --> 1:21:33.268
Okay.

1:21:37.314 --> 1:21:39.191
[bridal party laughing]

1:21:48.659 --> 1:21:50.118
Wow.

1:21:51.578 --> 1:21:52.704
Look at our girl.

1:21:52.788 --> 1:21:53.789
And free!

1:21:53.872 --> 1:21:57.584
So young, so free, so sweaty.

1:21:58.585 --> 1:21:59.628
So sweaty.

1:22:00.546 --> 1:22:01.547
Yeah.

1:22:14.643 --> 1:22:16.562
[chattering]

1:22:42.713 --> 1:22:44.756
[officiant speaking Balinese]

1:23:02.399 --> 1:23:04.693
[speaking Balinese]

1:23:23.629 --> 1:23:24.796
[in English] She is good.

1:23:24.880 --> 1:23:26.423
[crowd laughs]

1:24:13.303 --> 1:24:17.140
[officiant] And now for the final part
of the ceremony.

1:24:17.224 --> 1:24:18.350
Thank you so much.

1:24:18.433 --> 1:24:23.188
Gede will take the knife
and strike it through this pandanus,

1:24:23.897 --> 1:24:29.444
to show he and Lily
will be ready to live together.

1:24:42.082 --> 1:24:43.250
[sighs]

1:24:45.043 --> 1:24:46.837
[crowd murmuring]

1:24:50.382 --> 1:24:52.634
[speaking Balinese]

1:24:54.386 --> 1:24:58.265
[in English] Right place, right time,
right circumstance.

1:25:00.350 --> 1:25:02.436
Sorry, but we don't have all three.

1:25:05.147 --> 1:25:07.191
Georgia. Mr. Cotton.

1:25:08.442 --> 1:25:10.944
We needed your support, your blessing.

1:25:12.446 --> 1:25:13.530
And we don't have it.

1:25:16.158 --> 1:25:17.993
When I push this knife through this mat,

1:25:18.785 --> 1:25:20.287
it is a declaration that…

1:25:21.455 --> 1:25:25.417
this poem of a person and me
are now a family.

1:25:27.878 --> 1:25:29.630
We can't be a family without you.

1:25:31.924 --> 1:25:33.050
So I ask you.

1:25:33.133 --> 1:25:34.134
Please.

1:25:35.511 --> 1:25:36.512
For Lily and me.

1:25:38.013 --> 1:25:40.974
Or we will not marry.

1:25:42.351 --> 1:25:44.603
You didn't wanna run that by me first?

1:25:51.568 --> 1:25:53.403
You can do the hard stuff too.

1:25:57.991 --> 1:25:59.076
Um…

1:26:00.577 --> 1:26:01.995
You don't need our blessing.

1:26:03.038 --> 1:26:05.832
I mean, you have it. It's here, but…

1:26:09.294 --> 1:26:11.505
All you two really need is each other.

1:26:16.260 --> 1:26:20.681
If your mother and I had listened to
her awful parents or my dumbass friends,

1:26:20.764 --> 1:26:23.267
then Lily wouldn't be here at all.

1:26:23.350 --> 1:26:24.977
And I think we can all agree that…

1:26:26.228 --> 1:26:29.273
the world's a lot better place
with Lily in it.

1:26:30.065 --> 1:26:32.276
So, I…

1:26:35.737 --> 1:26:37.114
-Yeah?
-Mmm.

1:26:40.993 --> 1:26:42.828
Your mother and I are on your side.

1:26:43.996 --> 1:26:45.038
Both of you.

1:26:46.290 --> 1:26:47.291
Now and always.

1:26:48.750 --> 1:26:49.751
Yeah.

1:26:58.594 --> 1:26:59.761
[laughs]

1:27:00.554 --> 1:27:01.555
Shall we?

1:27:05.017 --> 1:27:06.852
[Lily sighs, clears throat]

1:27:09.396 --> 1:27:11.523
-Wait!
-[crowd murmuring]

1:27:11.607 --> 1:27:12.608
What?

1:27:14.735 --> 1:27:16.403
I'm just kidding.
Go for it. [chuckles]

1:27:16.486 --> 1:27:18.488
[all laughing]

1:27:20.199 --> 1:27:21.408
That's my daughter.

1:27:23.660 --> 1:27:25.829
[cheering]

1:27:44.556 --> 1:27:47.100
Do you think if we'd
kicked a coconut around a few times,

1:27:47.184 --> 1:27:49.353
things would have
worked out differently for us?

1:27:51.188 --> 1:27:54.358
I'm sure some red and white string
couldn't have hurt.

1:27:54.441 --> 1:27:55.943
[chuckles]

1:27:58.904 --> 1:28:00.531
Paul proposed.

1:28:00.614 --> 1:28:01.907
I know.

1:28:03.075 --> 1:28:05.160
This morning,
he-- he re-proposed.

1:28:06.954 --> 1:28:08.163
What did you say?

1:28:09.289 --> 1:28:12.417
I asked him for some ice
because he headbutted me.

1:28:12.501 --> 1:28:13.669
Hmm.

1:28:15.170 --> 1:28:17.422
A lot of guys would have
gone in for a kiss at that point.

1:28:17.506 --> 1:28:19.299
[both chuckle]

1:28:19.383 --> 1:28:20.759
Let me see your nose.

1:28:21.677 --> 1:28:22.678
Let's see.

1:28:22.761 --> 1:28:23.929
Mmm.

1:28:27.641 --> 1:28:28.934
I think you should say yes.

1:28:35.065 --> 1:28:36.066
Paul's a good guy.

1:28:36.149 --> 1:28:37.234
Mm-hmm.

1:28:38.610 --> 1:28:42.364
And if he makes you half as happy

1:28:42.447 --> 1:28:44.449
as we were when we were happy…

1:28:48.704 --> 1:28:49.997
then you should say yes.

1:28:53.208 --> 1:28:54.209
I don't know.

1:28:56.628 --> 1:28:59.715
Maybe I'm too old to feel young anymore.

1:29:01.341 --> 1:29:04.595
I think I missed something critical
and now it's too late.

1:29:07.014 --> 1:29:08.015
Well…

1:29:09.725 --> 1:29:11.643
you look like you're in your prime to me.

1:29:14.563 --> 1:29:15.564
[chuckles]

1:29:17.065 --> 1:29:18.609
Even with that crooked nose.

1:29:36.710 --> 1:29:38.337
-Hi.
-[guest] Hi.

1:29:57.898 --> 1:29:59.274
What are you doing out here?

1:30:00.651 --> 1:30:02.236
Just looking at this garbage.

1:30:03.529 --> 1:30:04.863
You call that a sunset?

1:30:20.838 --> 1:30:22.256
I belong here.

1:30:25.717 --> 1:30:26.718
I know.

1:30:34.309 --> 1:30:35.477
[chuckles]

1:30:37.855 --> 1:30:39.439
Will you come and dance with me?

1:30:46.238 --> 1:30:47.489
[David] Let's go dance.

1:31:01.795 --> 1:31:04.381
[whispers] Wow, it's so quiet.

1:31:07.593 --> 1:31:08.635
[inhales sharply]

1:31:08.719 --> 1:31:10.137
-Hi.

1:31:12.514 --> 1:31:14.057
-Did I wake you?
-No.

1:31:14.766 --> 1:31:16.435
-Was I kicking? I was kicking.
-No, no, no.

1:31:16.518 --> 1:31:18.604
-No, you weren't. You weren't. I was up.
-Okay.

1:31:19.855 --> 1:31:21.231
[sighs]

1:31:22.149 --> 1:31:23.734
-[sighs]
-Um…

1:31:24.359 --> 1:31:26.528
Well, the ferry is only
leaving this afternoon.

1:31:26.612 --> 1:31:28.405
I guess we could go paddleboarding.

1:31:31.158 --> 1:31:32.868
I can't marry you, Paul.

1:31:35.495 --> 1:31:37.331
It doesn't have to be
paddleboarding.

1:31:38.749 --> 1:31:39.833
Uh…

1:31:40.542 --> 1:31:41.793
Did I do something wrong?

1:31:41.877 --> 1:31:43.795
No. No, it's just--

1:31:43.879 --> 1:31:47.758
It's the wrong time, wrong place,

1:31:49.134 --> 1:31:50.219
wrong girl.

1:31:52.596 --> 1:31:53.764
I'm so sorry.

1:31:56.391 --> 1:31:59.478
[sighs]

1:32:00.145 --> 1:32:01.146
Me too.

1:32:03.023 --> 1:32:04.983
I'm not just agreeing to agree with you.

1:32:12.074 --> 1:32:13.784
I'm still gonna go paddleboarding.

1:32:16.411 --> 1:32:17.829

1:32:49.152 --> 1:32:51.363
Kick it! Kick it.

1:33:00.247 --> 1:33:02.165
Hold it up! Hold it up! Hold it up!

1:33:02.249 --> 1:33:03.959
No!

1:33:04.042 --> 1:33:05.460
Come on. More.

1:33:06.086 --> 1:33:07.087
More!

1:33:08.714 --> 1:33:11.884
Oh, fudge! Now it's going. Now it's go--

1:33:12.634 --> 1:33:14.303
It's going! It's going!

1:33:16.513 --> 1:33:17.764
Whoa!

1:33:25.606 --> 1:33:26.607
Where's Paul?

1:33:27.524 --> 1:33:29.985
He had a last-minute hop to Hanoi.

1:33:30.068 --> 1:33:31.528
Uh, he said to say bye.

1:33:32.863 --> 1:33:35.240
I told him
it wasn't gonna work out for me.

1:33:35.324 --> 1:33:36.325
For him.

1:33:36.408 --> 1:33:37.659
For me and him.

1:33:38.785 --> 1:33:40.037
I said it better than that.

1:33:41.872 --> 1:33:42.873
Oh, Mom.

1:33:43.540 --> 1:33:44.625
I'm sorry.

1:33:45.542 --> 1:33:47.503
Can we make this
a little more about me?

1:33:48.921 --> 1:33:50.130
Of course.

1:33:52.007 --> 1:33:54.301
What am I gonna do without you?

1:33:58.847 --> 1:34:00.224
I want you to have these.

1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:03.268
I was fine with you getting married,

1:34:03.352 --> 1:34:05.187
but I'm way too young and gorgeous

1:34:05.270 --> 1:34:06.897
-to be an aunt.
-[laughs]

1:34:14.780 --> 1:34:16.198

1:34:16.281 --> 1:34:17.616
All right. All right, kiddo.

1:34:18.951 --> 1:34:19.952
Okay.

-[chuckles] Dad.
-Oh, no. No crying.

1:34:28.418 --> 1:34:30.087
Okay. I love you.

1:34:35.551 --> 1:34:36.635
And I love you.

1:34:39.346 --> 1:34:40.347
All right.

1:34:44.810 --> 1:34:46.061
-All right.
-Bye.

1:34:46.144 --> 1:34:47.646
You take care of yourself.

1:34:47.729 --> 1:34:48.730
You too.

I love you.

1:35:38.322 --> 1:35:39.823
Sorry about Paul.

-No, you're not.
-Not really.

[Georgia] I'm gonna miss her.

1:35:49.249 --> 1:35:50.542
Yeah.

1:35:53.128 --> 1:35:54.880
I see why she likes it here.

1:35:56.131 --> 1:35:57.466
Yeah, it's good.

1:35:59.343 --> 1:36:01.553
I could see spending some time here.

1:36:02.554 --> 1:36:03.555
Someday.

1:36:14.525 --> 1:36:16.401
Why save the good stuff for later?

1:36:17.444 --> 1:36:19.238
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:36:33.126 --> 1:36:34.253
What?

1:36:48.433 --> 1:36:49.935
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

["This Old Heart of Mine
(Is Weak for You)" playing]

1:37:24.511 --> 1:37:27.890
I won't let her throw her life away
on some insanely handsome guy
