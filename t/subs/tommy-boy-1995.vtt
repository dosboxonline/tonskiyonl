00:21.500 --> 00:24.500
Tommy, hurry up, you're gonna
be late for school again!

00:45.798 --> 00:47.698
Son of a...

00:57.497 --> 01:01.896
TOMMY BOY

01:04.396 --> 01:06.496
Damn!

01:22.794 --> 01:24.494
Nice doggy, nice doggy!

01:27.494 --> 01:29.494
Holy shnikees!

01:34.993 --> 01:36.492
Late again Tommy?

01:36.493 --> 01:39.293
- You're pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard!

01:43.093 --> 01:44.992
Hurry up Tommy, hurry up!

01:54.492 --> 01:56.491
Damn!

02:26.589 --> 02:28.888
Hi. How are you?

02:48.387 --> 02:52.586
Oh, man!
No, please, God, no!

02:52.587 --> 02:54.386
Son of a...

03:39.282 --> 03:42.182
Sorry. Excuse me.
Pard me.

03:42.282 --> 03:44.082
Can I Just check this, uh.

03:44.083 --> 03:50.480
D +?
Oh my God! I passed!

03:50.481 --> 03:54.030
I passed! Oh, man I got a D+!

03:54.031 --> 03:57.579
I'm gonna graduate!

03:57.580 --> 04:02.180
I wish that we'd known each other.
This is a little awkward.

04:02.181 --> 04:04.380
I'm gonna graduate!

04:04.381 --> 04:06.180
D+!

04:16.079 --> 04:19.478
Hey guys, do I look different now that
I'm a college grad?

04:19.480 --> 04:21.278
Not really.

04:23.278 --> 04:26.377
Apparently they give a lot
fewer D+'s than D-'s.

04:26.378 --> 04:29.178
It's not a grade they like to give out,
I'll tell ya that right now.

04:29.179 --> 04:30.776
Yeah, you mentioned that.

04:30.777 --> 04:32.877
So, that's it for school, uh?
Now what?

04:32.878 --> 04:34.376
No idea.

04:34.377 --> 04:38.477
Well, for now I'll probably go back and
work in my dad's loading dock like always.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.676
And after that, figure it out.

04:40.677 --> 04:43.176
I'm gonna miss you man.
You're the best.

04:43.177 --> 04:46.275
Uh-uh, you are the best.

04:46.276 --> 04:50.876
I love all you guys.
Specially you.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.174
I'm gonna make a toast.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.775
To the best bunch of rugby
freaks ever born.

04:59.776 --> 05:00.474
Yes sir.

05:00.475 --> 05:03.174
Maybe we weren't the smartest
guys on campus.

05:03.175 --> 05:05.474
Maybe we spent too much time
puking off balconies.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.274
- But we had fun, huh?
- Yeah!

05:12.874 --> 05:15.873
Now, some of us are leaving,
and that is sad.

05:15.874 --> 05:18.472
But this isn't the end.
No way.

05:18.473 --> 05:21.473
We're gonna show this world
a thing or two. We're gonna show...

05:39.071 --> 05:41.470
- Richard Hayden?
- Tommy.

05:41.471 --> 05:44.121
So where's my dad? I thought he was
gonna meet me at the airport.

05:44.122 --> 05:46.771
He was at the airport this morning,
but you weren't on the plane.

05:46.772 --> 05:49.069
He said he had a surprise for me.

05:49.070 --> 05:50.669
Maybe. I guess you should have called.

05:50.670 --> 05:54.320
I did call, earlier, when...
using the phone.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.969
- Earlier? When was that?
- Er... later...

05:57.970 --> 05:59.368
When, when... then... I...
huh.., I left a message.

05:59.369 --> 06:00.768
A message?
What number did you call?

06:00.769 --> 06:07.468
- 249...5...678...

06:07.469 --> 06:10.768
I can't hear you. You're trailing off.
And did I catch a "niner" in there?

06:10.769 --> 06:12.668
What Were you calling from,
a walkie-talkie?

06:12.669 --> 06:14.367
No, it was cordless.

06:14.368 --> 06:16.968
You know what? Don't.
Not here, not now.

06:16.969 --> 06:19.467
Did you hear I finally graduated?

06:19.468 --> 06:22.266
Yeah. And just a shade under
a decade too. All right.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.367
You know, a lot of people
go to college for 7 years.

06:24.368 --> 06:26.467
I know. They're called doctors.

06:26.468 --> 06:29.167
Oh, that has to be you.

06:32.168 --> 06:34.167
Spray that thing for bugs?

06:57.164 --> 06:59.164
Hey, what happened to the tire plant?

06:59.165 --> 07:00.763
They shut it down last month.

07:00.764 --> 07:03.464
Would you mind not eating in the car?
It's kind of a rule.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.462
- You still got your GTX car, huh?
- Yes.

07:06.463 --> 07:09.562
And I dropped in a 440 Magnum
with a six-pack.

07:09.563 --> 07:12.362
You hang on to a car this cherry,
kinda' like your suitcase.

07:12.363 --> 07:17.162
Kinda' like your suitcase... Hey, what's
new with the old gang from high-school?

07:17.163 --> 07:20.162
I don't know Tommy. I didn't really
like the old gang from high-school.

07:21.562 --> 07:23.762
- Hey, the muffler plant's gone too.
- Yes.

07:24.562 --> 07:28.511
Come on! Dammit.

07:28.512 --> 07:32.461
That sounds good. Melted
chocolate inside the dash.

07:32.462 --> 07:34.260
That really ups the resale value.

07:34.261 --> 07:36.811
I think you're gonna be ok here.
They have a thin candy shell.

07:36.812 --> 07:39.360
'Surprised you didn't know that.

07:39.361 --> 07:42.560
I think your brain is
a thick candy shell.

07:42.561 --> 07:45.760
Your brain has the shell on it.

07:45.761 --> 07:48.160
- Are you talking?
- Shut up, Richard!

07:59.959 --> 08:03.508
Ron, don't tell me the bank
thinks we need to wait it out.

08:03.509 --> 08:07.058
Any business that tries to wait
it out will be just that, out.

08:07.059 --> 08:09.858
In auto-parts, you're either
growing our you're dying.

08:09.859 --> 08:11.257
There ain't no third direction.

08:11.258 --> 08:14.357
Tom, you're talking about a huge loan.
Maybe instead of borrowing,

08:14.358 --> 08:16.456
you should take on a partner.

08:16.457 --> 08:19.757
This always has and always
will be a family firm.

08:20.657 --> 08:22.756
My grandfather founded it in '21,

08:22.757 --> 08:24.956
my father kept it running
during the depression,

08:24.957 --> 08:27.156
my aunt Ilenne, ran it when
he went away to war

08:27.157 --> 08:28.756
and someday my son will run it.

08:28.757 --> 08:31.256
- Hi dad.
- Tommy!

08:39.855 --> 08:43.554
Am I proud of you.
Mister big time, college grad, huh?

08:43.556 --> 08:45.054
Thanks dad.

08:45.055 --> 08:48.554
- You're looking great kid.
- Thanks Mr. Rittenhauer.

08:48.555 --> 08:49.853
Oh, how you doin' Mr. Reilly?

08:49.854 --> 08:54.454
Real good. I had a kidney removed last
April, but I still have the other one.

08:54.455 --> 08:56.852
You remember Mr. Gilmore
from the bank?

08:56.853 --> 08:58.653
- Yeah. Nice to see you again sir.
- How are you?

08:58.654 --> 09:00.452
Listen, why don't you come out
on the floor with us?

09:00.453 --> 09:03.153
Mr. Gilmore needs reminding
of why he does business with us.

09:03.154 --> 09:04.552
Richard, could you huh...

09:04.553 --> 09:06.452
Run these figures by accounting.
No problem.

09:06.453 --> 09:09.952
My fellow nerds and I will retire
to the nerdery with our calculators.

09:09.953 --> 09:13.152
We should have something for you...
by this afternoon.

09:14.152 --> 09:18.451
Hard hats, gentlemen. If you get hit in
the head without wearing one of these,

09:18.452 --> 09:20.951
they scoop your brains up with
a goddamned soup ladle.

09:23.851 --> 09:26.251
Hey, look alive!
Low bridge!

09:28.351 --> 09:29.850
Son of a...

09:31.250 --> 09:32.950
- You all right, Tommy?
- Yeah...

09:32.951 --> 09:34.649
- What happened?
- Nothing.

09:34.650 --> 09:37.850
- Danny! How's that new son-in-law?
- He's a real pain in the butt.

09:37.851 --> 09:41.949
Hey Tommy, you're back!
Way to go on that D +!

09:41.950 --> 09:44.149
Thanks, Danny.
Looking good man.

09:49.449 --> 09:52.147
- Hey, Tommy!
- Hey man! How you doing?

09:52.148 --> 09:54.948
Hey how are you. Good to see ya,
how you doin'?

09:56.348 --> 09:58.848
- Hey, Sammy!
- Tommy! Welcome home buddy.

10:01.148 --> 10:03.346
Hang in there, Ron.
We're almost there.

10:03.347 --> 10:06.247
Lou, I got some papers I want
you to sign in the office.

10:06.248 --> 10:09.046
- Hey, Tommy!
- What are you doing on the floor?

10:09.047 --> 10:12.047
Yeah, I was going crazy on the loading
docks, so your dad moved me in here.

10:12.048 --> 10:14.045
- Hey, what is this thing?
- It's a buffer.

10:14.046 --> 10:16.846
I take oil filters that need smoothing
and give 'em a quick zap.

10:16.847 --> 10:18.145
Cool!

10:18.146 --> 10:20.646
- Can I try one?
- Help yourself.

10:27.645 --> 10:29.744
Nice distance.

10:29.745 --> 10:32.745
- Tommy! Come on! Let's go!
- Yes, sir. See ya.

10:34.545 --> 10:40.544
Here she is, Ron. My dream. This, my
friend, is our new brake pad division.

10:40.545 --> 10:43.243
And the future of "Callahan Auto".

10:43.244 --> 10:45.943
- Quite a sight, Tom.
- This is awesome.

10:45.944 --> 10:49.043
You say these brake pads are gonna
revolutionize the industry?

10:49.044 --> 10:51.142
Composed of high grade
steel and graphite.

10:51.143 --> 10:53.493
They're the goddamned Rolls Royce
of brake pads. That's what they are.

10:53.494 --> 10:55.843
I get tears off my eyes
just thinking about it.

11:02.842 --> 11:05.141
You coming awful fast,
how do you do it?

11:05.142 --> 11:08.242
I need fresh capital for material,
for new work force

11:08.243 --> 11:10.040
before I can turn these machines on.

11:10.041 --> 11:13.041
Look out!
I got cat- like speed and reflexes.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.191
In 23 years, have I ever
said no to you, huh?

11:17.192 --> 11:20.240
Why say "no" when it feels
so good to say "yes"?

11:29.940 --> 11:35.439
I was checking the, ah, specs on the
end line, for the rotary girder...

11:35.440 --> 11:39.239
- I'm retarded...
- Okay, Tom. Let's go!

11:39.240 --> 11:40.539
Yes, sir.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.038
Okay, left.

11:47.138 --> 11:48.837
Can I open my eyes now dad?

11:48.838 --> 11:51.438
I never told you you had to close
them in the first place, son.

11:51.439 --> 11:52.938
Yeah, go ahead! Open 'em up.

11:54.037 --> 11:55.136
That's my name!

11:55.137 --> 11:58.936
Yeah, and that's your new office
now, college grad. Go on in there!

11:58.937 --> 12:02.837
Awesome!
Hey, there's even a fridge!

12:02.838 --> 12:06.736
This is great... you
can put six-packs of be-

12:06.737 --> 12:09.835
Soda in here. Milk, yoghurt.

12:09.836 --> 12:11.786
You can put candy bars in the freezer.

12:11.787 --> 12:13.735
Anything that you wanna keep cool.

12:13.736 --> 12:16.935
Mr. Callahan, I need your
John Hancock on these reports.

12:16.936 --> 12:20.734
John Hancock...
It's Herbie Hancock.

12:20.735 --> 12:24.685
- Richard, check out my new office!
- You've a window.

12:24.686 --> 12:28.634
And why shouldn't you?
You've been here 10 minutes.

12:28.635 --> 12:31.434
Now look son, these are
our new catalogues.

12:31.435 --> 12:33.033
Get to know them,
they're important.

12:33.034 --> 12:37.634
Richard, you promise me you're gonna look
after Tommy here 'til he gets his feet wet.

12:37.635 --> 12:40.232
Sure. And thanks for choosing me.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.433
Now don't forget, we're
going home early today.

12:42.434 --> 12:44.633
I got another surprise for you.

12:44.634 --> 12:46.433
Cool! Thanks, dad.

12:49.532 --> 12:52.832
It's called reading. Top to bottom,
left to right.

12:52.833 --> 12:54.831
Group words
together as a sentence.

12:54.832 --> 12:57.732
Take Tylenol for any headaches.
Midol for any cramps.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.532
Shut up!

13:37.228 --> 13:38.827
Can I open my eyes now dad?

13:38.828 --> 13:40.928
For God's sake son, will you quit
covering your damned eyes?

13:42.028 --> 13:44.227
Holy shnikees!

13:52.027 --> 13:55.826
- Is that for me?
- No, son, that's for me.

13:58.026 --> 14:00.925
Dad, she's like a ten.

14:00.926 --> 14:04.226
Hi, honey.
This must be Tommy.

14:04.227 --> 14:07.524
- Are you Tommy?
- I'm Tommy.

14:07.525 --> 14:10.725
I'm Beverly,
and you're just adorable.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.424
Nah...

14:12.425 --> 14:16.175
Son, I got an announcement to make.

14:16.176 --> 14:19.924
Tom, I've asked Beverly
to be my wife.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.724
Wow, man!

14:27.924 --> 14:29.423
What did she say?

14:30.623 --> 14:34.823
It's so cool that you're getting married
Saturday. So where did you guys meet?

14:34.824 --> 14:36.622
Here you go, sweetie.

14:36.623 --> 14:39.821
We met at the fat farm
spa resort thing.

14:39.822 --> 14:43.622
Beverly was one of the trainers. In fact
she was the only one of the trainers

14:43.623 --> 14:46.222
I didn't wanna
plant six feet under a lettuce patch.

14:47.422 --> 14:52.120
Wait 'til you hear this! She's got a son.
He worked at the spa too.

14:52.121 --> 14:54.021
I met him. He's a terrific guy.
You're really gonna like him.

14:54.022 --> 14:55.921
He's coming here today,
for the wedding.

14:55.922 --> 15:01.421
Tommy, it sounds funny saying this, but
my son is going to be your new brother.

15:01.422 --> 15:06.920
Brother? I'm gonna have a brother?
I've always dreamed about having a brother.

15:08.220 --> 15:09.820
Speak of the devil.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.520
A brother!

15:15.819 --> 15:18.618
- Brother?
- I'm Paul, you must be Tommy.

15:18.619 --> 15:22.619
Brothers don't shake hands.
Brothers gotta hug.

15:36.717 --> 15:40.417
I can't believe I have a whole
new family. This is awesome!

15:40.418 --> 15:42.216
Yeah. Great.

15:42.217 --> 15:46.016
No offense, but if I showed a picture of
your mom to some of my buddies at school

15:46.017 --> 15:49.216
she'd definitely be
boner of the month.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.215
I'm honoured.

15:52.216 --> 15:54.716
So is there anything to
do in this town besides eat?

15:54.717 --> 15:58.614
Tons of stuff.
Late night pitch and putt.

15:58.615 --> 16:01.315
We go to the livestock auction
and cruise the 4-H babes.

16:01.316 --> 16:04.014
Throw stuff off the bridge.
What do you feel like doing?

16:04.015 --> 16:06.965
I don't know. Something
a little more dangerous.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.914
Sure. All you can handle bro.

16:22.313 --> 16:26.112
Look at 'em there!
Pretty maids all in a row.

16:26.113 --> 16:30.212
I want the one on the left.
She's perfect. Which one d'you want?

16:36.312 --> 16:38.811
- Does it make a difference?
- Oh, yeah.

16:38.812 --> 16:42.811
- Wait a second. Is this your first time?
- Yeah, Tommy, it is.

16:44.311 --> 16:47.261
You're gonna remember this
the rest of your life.

16:47.262 --> 16:50.211
Can't believe you've
never been cow tipping before.

16:50.212 --> 16:52.710
Get ready to live!

16:54.610 --> 16:59.510
She's sleeping. What you do is put
your shoulder into her and you push.

17:00.910 --> 17:03.409
- And?
- They fall over.

17:05.608 --> 17:08.808
And this doesn't strike
you as kinda' dumb?

17:08.809 --> 17:11.809
We're family. We're gonna be doing
lots of dumb stuff together.

17:11.810 --> 17:13.409
Wait 'til Christmas.

17:14.508 --> 17:16.207
You keep your feet
shoulder-width apart.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.407
Stay between the udder
and the hock, it's a...

17:19.409 --> 17:23.108
32 belly option on 2-1-2.
Ready! Hut!

17:28.907 --> 17:30.806
Holy Shnikees!

17:30.807 --> 17:32.807
Hey, get off my property!

17:32.808 --> 17:34.807
Run for it!

17:40.206 --> 17:43.506
- I'll save you brother!
- I'm ok. Get away from me!

17:43.507 --> 17:44.505
Get up!

17:44.506 --> 17:47.006
- Come on!
- I love you.

17:49.805 --> 17:51.504
Hey, get me! My turn!
Over here!

17:51.505 --> 17:54.904
These shoes are Italian.
They're worth more than your life.

17:54.905 --> 17:58.055
Man! Did I get dooshed with mud!

17:58.056 --> 18:01.204
Hey Chucko, that
doesn't smell like mud.

18:01.804 --> 18:04.504
Oh, man, that's cold!

18:04.505 --> 18:07.203
I'm a maniac. Maniac...

18:07.204 --> 18:13.403
... on the floor. And I'm dancing
like I never danced before.

18:16.003 --> 18:18.303
Did you eat a lot
of paint chips when you were a kid?

18:19.103 --> 18:20.603
Why?

18:40.401 --> 18:41.901
- Mornin', Richard.
- Hi.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.799
Luke, I am your father.

19:02.699 --> 19:04.899
I've interrupted "happy
time". Look, your father wants

19:04.900 --> 19:07.098
you to check out the
delay problems we're having

19:07.099 --> 19:10.898
at the loading dock. Now, I know you'd
love to just sit there and keep being...

19:10.899 --> 19:13.598
not slim, but we gotta
work a little today, okay.

19:13.599 --> 19:16.197
- That was from Star Wars".
- I know.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.196
R.T. I think I figured out the problem.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.246
This order's going to Columbus.
That's a one day delivery,

19:29.247 --> 19:32.296
but you've got it
marked down for two.

19:32.297 --> 19:37.296
That's because it's going to Columbus,
Georgia, not Columbus, Ohio.

19:37.297 --> 19:41.594
You see these letters by the city?
That's called a state.

19:41.595 --> 19:46.995
- What else you got, Wonder Boy?
- That's pretty much it for now.

19:46.996 --> 19:52.394
Tommy, maybe you should go back
to college for another 7 years

19:52.395 --> 19:53.894
and study a globe.

19:55.394 --> 19:57.093
Tommy Callahan?

19:57.094 --> 20:00.394
Michelle Brock. Chaparrall High.
Remember?

20:00.395 --> 20:04.293
Yeah, I remember!
I sat next to you in History.

20:04.294 --> 20:08.193
You work here?
It's so bizarre that you work here.

20:08.194 --> 20:11.292
Come on in!
Oh, and forget about R.T.!

20:11.293 --> 20:13.792
He's pissed off 'cause he recently
found out what a loser he is.

20:13.793 --> 20:16.292
A loser he is!

20:17.492 --> 20:21.892
Nice. How come you don't put
the files in the file cabinets?

20:21.893 --> 20:23.590
I don't like file cabinets.

20:23.591 --> 20:25.190
- Why not?
- You have to open them.

20:25.191 --> 20:27.091
I've got my own system.
Hasn't failed me yet.

20:27.092 --> 20:28.990
All the shipping
orders go through me,

20:28.991 --> 20:32.291
which means I spend about half of my
pathetically anal life in here.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.289
So if I couldn't do
things my own way,

20:34.290 --> 20:36.290
I'd probably freak out and
blow up the whole town.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.089
Cool!

20:38.090 --> 20:42.389
Hey, remember your brother, Duane?
Whatever happened to him?

20:42.390 --> 20:46.089
We used to go to "Safeway" all the time
and get caught trying to steal doughnuts.

20:46.090 --> 20:49.389
He's a cop. He had to get
a real job when my parents

20:49.390 --> 20:51.289
moved to Cuyahoga Falls.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.587
- Want one?
- I'd better not.

20:58.588 --> 21:02.388
I have what doctors call
a little bit of a weight problem.

21:02.389 --> 21:05.638
I used to grab bear claws
as a kid, two at a time

21:05.639 --> 21:08.887
and I'd get 'em lodged
right in this region here.

21:08.888 --> 21:11.587
- How about some coffee?
- I'd love some.

21:18.686 --> 21:22.486
- Man, I bet half the town's here.
- Yeah...

21:23.586 --> 21:27.386
- You look great dad.
- You look good too, Tommy Boy.

21:29.785 --> 21:34.785
Listen, this marriage thing, I know
it's a big step... but you know...

21:34.786 --> 21:36.585
Ever since your mom died...

21:43.084 --> 21:47.084
Something about getting old
and being alone.

21:48.684 --> 21:50.184
You know... it's something...

21:53.883 --> 21:57.383
Dad... It's cool, you know.

21:57.384 --> 22:00.883
I just want you to be happy.

22:02.183 --> 22:04.382
Yeah, I know you do.
And I am, kid!

22:04.383 --> 22:06.082
I am, Tommy boy.

22:07.082 --> 22:10.582
- They're ready for you sir.
- Good. We're ready too.

22:12.182 --> 22:15.081
- How do we look?
- Chubby?

22:19.181 --> 22:21.281
I think that's the champagne talking.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.630
And so these vows are held sacred from

22:27.631 --> 22:30.179
now until eternity.
If there's any person

22:30.180 --> 22:33.480
who finds a reason these
two should not be wed,

22:33.481 --> 22:36.479
speak now or forever hold your peace.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.479
You kiddin'?
Go get her, Tom!

22:40.479 --> 22:44.879
Now by the power invested in
me by the state of Ohio,

22:44.880 --> 22:49.278
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

23:12.376 --> 23:14.475
Say something for the bride and groom!

23:14.476 --> 23:18.375
Hey dad and Beverly, this is Michelle Brock,
the prettiest gal in Sandusky.

23:18.376 --> 23:21.675
- Michelle, say a little something into the camera!
- A little something into the camera.

23:23.075 --> 23:27.125
Sounds good, Tom, but I'd like to take
a look at your operation before I commit.

23:27.126 --> 23:31.174
Fair enough, Doug. 'Course I can get a
hell of a good look at a t-bone steak

23:31.175 --> 23:32.973
by sticking my head up a bulls ass,

23:32.974 --> 23:34.774
but I'd rather take
a butcher's word for it.

23:35.874 --> 23:37.973
Bull's ass, that's great.

23:37.974 --> 23:39.773
And you guarantee everything you sell?

23:39.774 --> 23:43.473
You know I could guarantee you all day
long, but we both know a guarantee is

23:43.474 --> 23:45.573
only as good as the man who writes it.

23:46.573 --> 23:49.473
Sounds good, Tom.
I'll send the contract next week.

23:49.474 --> 23:50.772
Good man!

23:50.773 --> 23:52.072
You're still the best, Tom.

23:52.073 --> 23:54.872
Eight whisky-sours and I still sell
the son of a bitch. Damn I'm good.

23:56.372 --> 23:59.271
I just wanna tell you you really
look dynamite today, Beverly.

23:59.272 --> 24:03.272
Yeah, Tom, you're a lucky man.
Boy, would I like to get some of that!

24:03.273 --> 24:04.571
Good Lord!

24:05.671 --> 24:09.471
Oh no! Listen, Richard, you got
a edit button on that thing?

24:09.472 --> 24:12.221
- It'll cost ya.
- Come here, you little prick!

24:12.222 --> 24:14.971
All right, all right,
hold it a second folks!

24:14.972 --> 24:17.269
Wait a minute...
Yeah, yeah, workin'.

24:17.270 --> 24:20.270
Listen, I wanna thank you
all for coming today

24:20.271 --> 24:23.269
to welcome two new Callahans
to the family.

24:23.270 --> 24:26.419
My beautiful wife, Beverly
and my new son, Paul.

24:26.420 --> 24:29.569
I feel like I'm the luckiest
man in the world today.

24:30.869 --> 24:32.568
Hit it!

24:32.569 --> 24:37.268
And right now I'm gonna need you,
Tommy boy, to get this place going.

24:37.269 --> 24:40.068
- Oh, for me dad?
- Yeah, you Tommy boy.

24:40.069 --> 24:43.168
Dad, I really don't think...
Okay.

24:44.068 --> 24:47.468
First rocker, take it,
Tommy boy!

24:53.967 --> 24:56.367
That's right, Tommy boy!

25:03.866 --> 25:05.466
Shake the rock to me!

25:09.766 --> 25:11.965
That's right, dad!

25:48.662 --> 25:49.561
Dad?

25:49.562 --> 25:51.962
Somebody call 911!

26:06.660 --> 26:09.510
There's not much more
we can say, really.

26:09.511 --> 26:12.360
We've lost someone
we love, and it hurts.

26:12.361 --> 26:15.710
Even though Tom is gone,

26:15.711 --> 26:19.059
he'll remain in our lives for ever.

26:19.060 --> 26:22.409
comforting us, making us laugh...

26:22.410 --> 26:25.759
and marching over us.

27:42.452 --> 27:44.151
My dad gave me this boat.

27:44.152 --> 27:47.650
We'd come out here late at night,
when there's no one else in the lake

27:47.651 --> 27:50.651
and then he'd be over there,
on the shore, and he'd yell:

27:50.652 --> 27:53.651
"Quit playing with your dingie!"

27:57.750 --> 27:59.650
I'm gonna really miss him.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.050
- Your father was a great guy.
- Yeah.

28:12.949 --> 28:15.148
I'm really glad you
brought me out here.

28:15.149 --> 28:19.548
Can't believe you wanted to.
Although it's pretty fun.

28:19.549 --> 28:21.647
If we had some wind...

28:21.648 --> 28:24.398
I can't believe there's no wind.

28:24.399 --> 28:26.923
You need wind... cause it, uh-

28:26.924 --> 28:29.448
- Helps push the sail.
- Yeah.

28:32.147 --> 28:35.097
So, what are you gonna do now?

28:35.098 --> 28:38.047
I don't know.

28:39.247 --> 28:43.546
But, I gotta do something.
I don't know what.

28:43.547 --> 28:48.045
- Man, do I sound like an idiot?
- No.

28:48.046 --> 28:52.345
Sorry about this wind. I can't believe
there isn't any wind out here.

28:52.346 --> 28:58.645
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's great. It's very peaceful.

29:00.145 --> 29:03.444
Hey tub-o! You ain't moving!

29:03.445 --> 29:06.743
Yeah, need a little wind here!

29:06.744 --> 29:10.944
No. You need to drop
a couple 100 pounds, blimp!

29:11.944 --> 29:13.843
Rascals.

29:13.844 --> 29:16.443
I guess that's your theory.

29:17.743 --> 29:20.443
So, we'll see what
happens tomorrow.

29:20.444 --> 29:23.142
Hey, your sail is limp,
like your dick!

29:23.143 --> 29:26.142
Watch your language
in front of the lady, punk!

29:26.143 --> 29:28.941
Geez!
You were saying?

29:28.942 --> 29:31.541
Hey, Gilligan,
did you eat the Skipper?

29:31.542 --> 29:37.741
You kids better pray to the god of skinny
punks that this wind doesn't pick up,

29:37.742 --> 29:41.641
cause I'll come over there
and shove an oar up your ass!

29:44.441 --> 29:48.240
Jeepers creepers, those guys keep
interrupting us. I'm sorry about that.

29:48.241 --> 29:50.239
You were saying about the uh...

29:50.240 --> 29:53.840
Hey lady, look out!
There's a fat whale on your boat!

29:53.841 --> 29:56.040
Yeah. Free Willy!

29:56.740 --> 29:59.889
Listen up you little spazoids,
I know where you live and

29:59.890 --> 30:03.038
I've seen where you sleep.
I swear to everything holy

30:03.039 --> 30:05.439
that your mothers will cry when
they see what I've done to you!

30:18.338 --> 30:21.537
I was just kidding.
I've no idea where they live.

30:22.537 --> 30:24.437
That was awesome!

30:30.237 --> 30:32.635
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're in real trouble.

30:32.636 --> 30:36.436
Zalinsky Industries has an offer
on the table to buy us out.

30:36.437 --> 30:39.836
But as you realize "Callahan"
has been family owned

30:39.837 --> 30:43.235
since Tommy's great grandfather
laid the first brick

30:43.236 --> 30:46.635
And I'll be damned if that's
gonna change on my watch.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.634
Frank, if we sell while
our value's still high,

30:48.635 --> 30:51.635
everyone who owns stock in this
company stands to make a lot of money.

30:51.636 --> 30:54.033
That of course includes you,
Mrs. Callahan,

30:54.034 --> 30:56.433
Now that you and Tommy
are the primary shareholders.

30:56.434 --> 30:59.634
It seems vulgar to think about
money at a time like this.

30:59.635 --> 31:01.733
I don't wanna hear
the word "sell" again.

31:01.734 --> 31:04.833
But Ron, we do need that loan
to keep us afloat

31:04.834 --> 31:06.432
until we figure things out.

31:06.433 --> 31:09.733
I'm sorry, Frank, we can't do it.
Tom got in way over his head when he

31:09.734 --> 31:11.232
built the new brake pad division.

31:11.233 --> 31:13.432
The bank just can't take any
chance in putting up any more money.

31:13.433 --> 31:18.032
Now, let's face it, when big Tom died,
"Callahan Auto" may have died with him.

31:18.033 --> 31:20.932
If this factory goes under,
the whole town goes under.

31:20.933 --> 31:23.232
And that's when the whores come in.

31:24.732 --> 31:25.931
Excuse me, what was that?

31:25.932 --> 31:30.531
Men laying their trick-money down.
20 dollars to pay the rent?

31:30.532 --> 31:32.830
Maybe instead I'll spend it
on the whore.

31:32.831 --> 31:35.031
Frank, I really don't think
we have any choice.

31:35.032 --> 31:37.331
Maybe I can help.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.629
I give you everything I've got:
my house, the stock.

31:41.630 --> 31:45.230
If I give you that stuff, it's collateral,
then would you give us that loan?

31:46.830 --> 31:48.629
Yes, I suppose so.

31:48.630 --> 31:52.729
Wait a second! What are you saying, Tommy?
You just wanna hand over your inheritance?

31:52.730 --> 31:55.428
Right. If it'll help get
the brake pads going.

31:55.429 --> 31:58.229
My dad said the new pads
were the future of "Callahan".

31:58.230 --> 32:01.378
But who's going to sell them?

32:01.379 --> 32:04.527
I will.

32:04.528 --> 32:07.527
- I'll go on my dad's sale trip.
- I'll be damned!

32:07.528 --> 32:11.627
Whores running around doing their
little behind shake for the men folk.

32:11.628 --> 32:12.826
I kinda like her idea.

32:12.827 --> 32:16.727
For Christ's sake, once during
the war I visited a prostitute,

32:16.728 --> 32:19.126
and my life has been
a living hell ever since.

32:19.127 --> 32:23.726
Hold on a minute! Do we really wanna put
the future of the company in Tommy's hands?

32:23.727 --> 32:26.025
We're running low
on options here, Ted.

32:26.026 --> 32:28.626
I can hold out Zalinsky
for a couple of weeks.

32:28.627 --> 32:30.025
What have we got to lose?

32:30.026 --> 32:31.825
How about the jobs of 300 people?

32:31.826 --> 32:34.925
No offense, Tommy, but you don't know
the first thing about brake pads.

32:34.926 --> 32:39.025
Hey, I know I'm not probably the
answer you guys are looking for,

32:39.026 --> 32:42.124
but I feel I gotta do something.

32:42.125 --> 32:47.524
You're right. I don't know much
about this stuff, but he does.

32:47.525 --> 32:48.723
Oh, no!

32:48.724 --> 32:51.724
That's right. Richard knows more
about brake pads than anyone in here.

32:51.725 --> 32:54.323
And since you were my dad's
right-hand man,

32:54.324 --> 32:58.023
I see you have the rest of
the year pretty much wide open.

32:58.024 --> 32:59.922
Time out! Bad idea.

32:59.923 --> 33:02.423
I don't think anyone could help
Baby Huey out there on the road.

33:02.424 --> 33:04.023
You have a better suggestion?

33:18.221 --> 33:20.921
I can actually hear
you're getting fatter.

33:22.721 --> 33:24.821
What did I say about
eating in the car, anyways?

33:24.822 --> 33:26.921
That it's not good cause
it spoils your dinner?

33:28.121 --> 33:32.220
Hey, Tommy, this is not a vacation for me.
And I'm here against my will,

33:32.221 --> 33:34.420
so the least you can do
is pretend to work.

33:34.421 --> 33:36.319
Ok? Now let's review!

33:36.320 --> 33:39.270
Okay, you're right. Review time.
Let's do it up! Feed me!

33:39.271 --> 33:42.219
First, what are the three grades
of Callahan Brake pads?

33:42.220 --> 33:47.518
Personal, commercial and... agricultural.

33:47.519 --> 33:50.619
And what is our carrying charge for
all the merchandise in the warehouse?

33:53.518 --> 33:55.717
- One and a...
- Half per cent!

33:55.718 --> 33:58.018
I knew that!
Why can't I remember it?

33:58.019 --> 33:59.917
Try an association, like, uh:

33:59.918 --> 34:02.817
Let's say the average person
uses 10% of their brain.

34:02.818 --> 34:05.516
How much do you use?
1,5%.

34:05.517 --> 34:09.016
The rest is clogged with
malted hops and bong resin.

34:16.315 --> 34:19.416
I gotta do this!
This's got to be the one!

34:19.417 --> 34:22.516
I gotta do this.
It's gotta be me...

34:24.915 --> 34:28.014
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Sorry, I'm ready.

34:28.014 --> 34:31.014
- Hey, does this suit make me look fat?
- No, your face does.

34:31.016 --> 34:34.315
Okay, let's check you out!
All right.

34:34.315 --> 34:37.612
- That's a clip-on.
- Are you sure?

34:37.614 --> 34:41.514
Alright now, it's sales time,
remember we don't take no-

34:41.514 --> 34:43.213
- No shit from anyone.
- No.

34:43.214 --> 34:46.413
- We don't take no prisoners.
- We don't take no for an answer.

34:46.414 --> 34:48.913
Oh yeah. We don't take
no for an answer...

34:55.913 --> 34:57.562
- No.
- Okey dokey.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.211
- No.
- Gotcha. Thanks.

34:59.212 --> 35:02.212
Terrific! Thanks for your time.

35:02.213 --> 35:05.112
Let me say... maybe.

35:07.012 --> 35:10.811
Well then, I'd just like to add
that the spectrometer

35:10.812 --> 35:12.810
read-out on the nickel-cadmium
alloy mix

35:12.811 --> 35:14.911
indicates a good, rich
strobe n' fade, decreasing

35:14.912 --> 35:17.011
incidence of wear
to the pressure plate.

35:17.012 --> 35:19.910
- If you could just...
- Whoa, little fella, you're not speaking my language.

35:22.210 --> 35:24.960
What my associate is trying to say,

35:24.961 --> 35:27.710
is that our new brake
pads are really cool.

35:27.711 --> 35:29.209
You're not even gonna believe it.

35:29.210 --> 35:33.709
Like, let's say you're driving along
the road, with your family...

35:33.710 --> 35:34.909
And you're driving along...

35:36.009 --> 35:38.009
And then all of a sudden
there's a truck tire

35:38.010 --> 35:40.009
in the middle of the road,
and you hit the brakes.

35:40.809 --> 35:42.208
Woah, that was close.

35:43.108 --> 35:46.907
Now let's see what happens when you're
driving with "the other guy's brake pads".

35:46.908 --> 35:49.608
You're driving along,
you're driving along,

35:49.609 --> 35:52.308
and suddenly your kids are
yelling from the back seat.

35:52.309 --> 35:55.507
"I gotta go to the bathroom, daddy!"
"Not now, dammit!"

35:55.508 --> 35:59.207
Truck tire! I can't stop!

36:02.807 --> 36:04.106
There's a cliff!

36:06.106 --> 36:10.706
And your family screaming:
"Oh my God, we're burning alive!"

36:10.707 --> 36:16.605
No, I can't feel my leg!
Here comes the meat-wagon.

36:16.606 --> 36:20.105
And the medic gets out and says:
"Oh, my God!"

36:20.106 --> 36:23.605
New guy's in the corner,
puking his guts out.

36:26.104 --> 36:29.504
All because you wanna save a couple of
extra pennies... and to me, it doesn't-

36:31.504 --> 36:34.004
Get out! Now!

36:34.005 --> 36:36.504
Yes, sir.

36:38.603 --> 36:40.303
- Do you validate?
- Now!

36:55.802 --> 36:57.201
She's a quart low.

36:57.202 --> 36:59.951
Oh, yeah? Then guess what,
open it back up and put it in!

36:59.952 --> 37:02.426
That's your penance for your
puppet show back there.

37:02.427 --> 37:04.900
And while you're at it,
fill it up with gas, okay?

37:04.901 --> 37:08.501
I'm gonna ask directions to the
next huge embarrassing failure.

37:08.502 --> 37:11.000
You're a huge embarrassing failure.

37:11.001 --> 37:13.500
- What?
- Nuthin'.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.899
Hey chief, could you tell me
how far it is to Davenport?

37:23.899 --> 37:25.198
22 mi.

37:25.199 --> 37:29.399
- I can't find it on this map.
- Well, get yourself a new map.

37:33.898 --> 37:35.498
Son of a...

38:02.196 --> 38:07.195
Well, it's gotta be on the map,
Davenport, because you say it's 22mi away.

38:07.196 --> 38:11.594
And you're really smart...
Yet it's not on the map.

38:11.595 --> 38:14.695
- I'm picking up your sarcasm.
- I'd hope so...

38:14.696 --> 38:16.695
'cause I'm laying it
on you pretty thick.

38:28.793 --> 38:31.492
That's a map of Illinois,
which we're in.

38:31.493 --> 38:36.193
On the border of Iowa. Which is
where Davenport is, 22 mi away.

38:36.194 --> 38:39.792
You're in the wrong state.
Get yourself a new map!

38:41.592 --> 38:46.992
That wasn't so hard, was it?
How much do I owe your for gas?

38:46.993 --> 38:49.592
- You didn't pump any.
- What?!

38:51.691 --> 38:53.490
Why didn't you pump any gas?

38:53.491 --> 38:57.091
They're all out. They only got diesel.
Better go to the next station!

39:07.490 --> 39:09.290
What'd you do?

39:15.389 --> 39:20.288
I'd just like to welcome you all
to our annual Callahan Employee Night.

39:20.289 --> 39:25.988
I know it doesn't quite feel the same without
Big Tom here, but we're still a family.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.688
So let's try and have some fun!

39:30.588 --> 39:35.237
Hey, Mr. Rittenhauer! Is it true Tommy's
on the road trying to save this place?

39:35.238 --> 39:39.887
Tommy's out there filling in for his
dad until we get things settled here.

39:39.888 --> 39:42.386
Are you kidding?
We're all screwed!

39:42.387 --> 39:45.286
That kid's one apple that
fell way off the tree.

39:52.286 --> 39:56.485
Mommy, I want a popsicle.

39:57.785 --> 39:59.184
That hurt!

39:59.185 --> 40:01.485
You wanna act like a baby,
I'll treat you like one.

40:04.085 --> 40:06.285
Now, if you wanna act
like a big boy...

40:12.284 --> 40:13.883
Bad mommy.

40:13.884 --> 40:16.583
Don't call me that, it's creepy.

40:16.584 --> 40:18.982
Come on, this is working out
better than we planned.

40:18.983 --> 40:21.883
I thought it'd take a year to bleed
him dry in the divorce settlement.

40:21.884 --> 40:24.133
Instead the guy croaks,
you own half the company.

40:24.134 --> 40:26.383
Yeah, it's too bad he didn't
leave me any cash.

40:26.384 --> 40:28.382
- You talked to the banker?
- Yeah.

40:28.383 --> 40:31.082
Unfortunately your stock isn't worth
dick until they sell the place.

40:31.083 --> 40:33.482
That moment is rapidly approaching.

40:36.882 --> 40:38.481
Hi, grandpa.

40:38.482 --> 40:41.880
Mr. Rittenhauer, is Tommy,
you know, doing okay?

40:41.881 --> 40:46.281
Yeah, sometimes it takes a little time
for a salesman to find his style.

40:47.681 --> 40:50.281
- You think he's finding one?
- I hope so.

40:51.181 --> 40:53.230
Hold on right there
honey. I'll see you Michelle.

40:53.231 --> 40:55.280
See you.

41:07.279 --> 41:10.679
I'm telling you, Paul... the only
thing keeping us poor is Tommy.

41:10.680 --> 41:14.378
The guy's an idiot.
He won't sell squat.

41:14.379 --> 41:16.878
This is what I think of Callahan.

41:17.678 --> 41:21.078
Tommy saved the factory.
That's a laugh!

41:36.076 --> 41:37.975
I don't see any McKeesport.

41:37.976 --> 41:41.526
It's the next town, Tons-of-Fun.
It's gotta be there.

41:41.527 --> 41:45.076
Ok, where's moron?
Moron's here, so McKeesport...

41:46.576 --> 41:49.375
Look, Magellan,
we're at this wrinkle here.

42:00.874 --> 42:03.373
You saw it happen. There was
nothing I could do, right?

42:03.374 --> 42:07.074
Maybe if you didn't lean over to insult
me you would have seen it coming.

42:07.075 --> 42:08.774
Shut up, Tommy!
It's not my fault.

42:08.775 --> 42:10.972
Poor little furry thing!

42:10.973 --> 42:13.272
I'd never seen one close up before.

42:13.273 --> 42:16.173
What are we gonna do?
We can't just leave it here.

42:25.872 --> 42:28.171
Oh, no! Loading it up took
us over an hour.

42:28.172 --> 42:30.571
Now we only got 20 minutes before
"Brady Automotive" closes.

42:30.572 --> 42:33.471
- Yeah, where are we gonna take the deer?
- I don't know. The vet?

42:33.472 --> 42:35.170
You take dead animals to the vet?

42:35.171 --> 42:38.071
- Why not? I'd take you to the vet.
- Yeah, I'll take you to the...

42:38.072 --> 42:40.670
- Got that?
- Shut up!

42:40.671 --> 42:43.370
- It's just down the hall sir, last door on the left.
- Thank you.

42:44.370 --> 42:45.569
Hey, what's your hurry?

42:45.570 --> 42:47.769
You know that thing in the back seat?

42:47.770 --> 42:50.570
It's not an air freshener.
It's a dead rotting deer carcass.

42:50.571 --> 42:52.069
And we gotta take care of it quick.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.869
And this is one of our
oldest customers,

42:53.870 --> 42:54.868
we should be in and out.

42:54.869 --> 42:57.319
This sales thing isn't so easy.

42:57.320 --> 42:59.769
You can't just go in and out,
you gotta finesse'm a little bit.

42:59.770 --> 43:01.969
Hey, by finesse do you mean
sputtering sentence fragments

43:01.970 --> 43:03.768
and lighting things on fire?

43:03.769 --> 43:06.867
No, but... It's nice to
see you again Mr. Insult.

43:06.868 --> 43:10.468
Say, have you seen Richard anywhere?
Cause if you do, can you ask him,

43:10.469 --> 43:14.768
I mean, since he's so good,
if he might wanna try selling?

43:14.769 --> 43:16.467
Oh yeah? Watch and learn.

43:17.767 --> 43:20.967
Of course I understand what "no" means.
But if I took no for an answer

43:20.968 --> 43:23.266
I probably would wind up
on a street corner selling

43:23.267 --> 43:26.965
spicy hotdogs and wearing a funny hat,
right? It makes sense, doesn't it?

43:26.966 --> 43:29.466
Look, I've been doing
business with Callahan

43:29.467 --> 43:31.966
since I hung up my shingle.
But I don't like you.

43:31.967 --> 43:33.565
Probably never will.

43:33.566 --> 43:37.066
You're a smug unhappy little man, and
you treat people like they were idiots.

43:40.565 --> 43:44.364
Mr. Brady, you and my dad go way back.

43:44.365 --> 43:47.864
Son, I was sorry to hear
about your dad, I was.

43:47.865 --> 43:50.914
But before I decide to keep
my business with your place,

43:50.915 --> 43:53.963
I'd have to come by and have
a look at your new operation.

43:53.964 --> 43:55.964
Hey, I'll tell you what:
you can take a good look

43:55.965 --> 43:57.964
at a butcher's ass by
sticking your head up there

43:57.965 --> 44:00.162
but wouldn't you rather
take his word for it?

44:00.163 --> 44:05.462
What? I'm failing to make
the connection here, son.

44:05.463 --> 44:08.313
No, I mean, you can get
a good look at a T-bone

44:08.314 --> 44:11.162
by sticking your head up
a butcher's ass, but then...

44:11.163 --> 44:13.763
No, it's gotta be your bull.

44:13.764 --> 44:17.361
Here's the deal, if I want you--

44:17.362 --> 44:19.961
- You have derailed.
- Shut up, Richard!

44:19.962 --> 44:22.010
Boy, I'm really at
a loss for words here.

44:22.011 --> 44:24.060
Forget it. I quit.

44:24.061 --> 44:30.961
I can't do this anymore man. My head's
about to explode. My whole life sucks.

44:30.962 --> 44:33.160
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know where I'm going.

44:33.161 --> 44:35.759
My dad just died.
We just killed Bambi.

44:35.760 --> 44:39.360
I'm out here getting my ass kicked,
and every time I drive down the road,

44:39.361 --> 44:43.460
I want to jerk the wheel into
a goddamn bridge embankment!

44:50.359 --> 44:52.959
We'll be in touch.

45:01.358 --> 45:04.557
That guy might not call us.

45:04.558 --> 45:06.556
I can't believe you called me a psycho.

45:06.557 --> 45:08.557
Were you in there just now?
You are a psycho.

45:08.558 --> 45:10.356
Good God! And comb your hair.

45:10.357 --> 45:14.457
I wouldn't say you did much better.
I thought you were so cool.

45:14.458 --> 45:18.556
Watch and learn he says. And I
was watching. You know what I saw?

45:26.456 --> 45:28.355
It's alive!

45:30.155 --> 45:32.355
I think it tried to bite me!

45:58.853 --> 46:01.851
No way that just happened.

46:01.852 --> 46:04.851
My car is completely destroyed.

46:04.852 --> 46:12.751
I swear I've seen a lot of stuff
in my life, but that was awesome!

46:14.351 --> 46:18.751
But sorry about your car, man.
It sucks.

46:24.250 --> 46:27.450
We'll return to the "Zalinsky Family Theater"
after these messages.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.750
Will you shut the window, Tommy!
You're letting moths in.

46:29.751 --> 46:31.950
- No, it's hot in here.
- Will you please...

46:31.951 --> 46:32.849
Look, it's him!

46:32.850 --> 46:35.849
America, if you need starters,
spark plugs, ball joints,

46:35.850 --> 46:38.049
gaskets, camshafts,
u-joints or rocker-arms,

46:38.050 --> 46:40.049
anything that can be screwed or
glued to that car or truck of yours?

46:40.050 --> 46:41.349
Come see ol' Ray!

46:41.350 --> 46:45.049
You want a guarantee? I got a
guarantee stamped on every box.

46:45.050 --> 46:47.348
He's got really weird hair.

46:47.349 --> 46:51.548
But more important is the guarantee
that I make to the American worker.

46:51.549 --> 46:54.848
I want your truck to help
you get the job done.

46:54.849 --> 46:58.447
I want your cruiser to get out there safely,
so you can clean up the streets.

46:58.448 --> 47:01.647
And I want your kids to be safe
when you take them for a ride.

47:01.648 --> 47:04.447
- Thanks, Ray.
- Thank you, son.

47:04.448 --> 47:09.246
The name's Zalinsky. I make car parts
for the American working man,

47:09.247 --> 47:12.246
because that's who I am.
And that's who I care about.

47:12.247 --> 47:16.146
Drive down to Zalinsky.
He's the auto parts king.

47:16.147 --> 47:18.445
He seems like a nice guy.

47:18.446 --> 47:22.145
This is the guy trying to buy the company,
not to mention put you on the street

47:22.146 --> 47:24.945
and all you can say is
"he seems like a nice guy"?

47:24.946 --> 47:26.545
He does.

47:29.345 --> 47:34.944
Michelle! I'm glad you called me back.
Yeah, things are going great.

47:34.945 --> 47:37.443
I feel my first sale
coming out real soon.

47:37.444 --> 47:41.843
Yeah, he's here. He's just going
over his car insurance forms.

47:41.844 --> 47:43.543
Could we get any more moths in here?

47:44.843 --> 47:47.942
What? Oh, Richard's vacuuming.

47:47.943 --> 47:52.941
He's vacuuming. I don't know.
I guess he's clean.

47:52.942 --> 47:57.342
Can I call you back in a few minutes?
Thanks. I miss you.

47:57.343 --> 48:00.042
Hey! You can't sleep
with the window open.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.741
And let me lay down
some other rules too.

48:02.742 --> 48:08.141
- What are you so mad about?
- Are you nuts? Do you even have to ask?

48:08.142 --> 48:11.540
My car is destroyed.
We haven't made one sale.

48:11.541 --> 48:13.591
Which means we only
have to sell about a

48:13.592 --> 48:15.640
half million brake pads
in the next ten days,

48:15.641 --> 48:17.539
or else the factory is going under.

48:17.540 --> 48:21.440
And the one guy who should be caring
about this, you, doesn't.

48:25.939 --> 48:28.839
You know what, Richard? You don't know
me as good as you think you do.

48:28.840 --> 48:32.639
I care about stuff, I'm getting
better at this sales thing.

48:32.640 --> 48:36.937
I'm not, but I could if you help me.

48:36.938 --> 48:40.038
Forget it, I have enough to do without
having to change your diapers.

48:45.738 --> 48:51.237
- Richard, is this your coat?
- Don't do it!

48:51.238 --> 48:53.837
Fat guy in little coat.

48:55.737 --> 48:56.836
No.

48:56.837 --> 49:01.336
Fat guy in a little coat.

49:05.436 --> 49:07.686
Take it off.
I'm serious.

49:07.687 --> 49:09.935
Richard, what's happening?

49:26.234 --> 49:29.334
- Good tune man.
- I don't think so.

49:31.134 --> 49:36.433
- Yeah, here we go.
- This song sucks.

49:41.533 --> 49:44.332
- Talk about lame.
- Totally.

49:45.232 --> 49:46.631
You can change it if you want.

49:46.632 --> 49:48.732
- I don't care, it's up to you.
- I can live with it if you can.

49:48.733 --> 49:50.032
Suit yourself.

50:35.828 --> 50:37.328
Oh, God.

50:54.626 --> 50:57.426
Hey, I was just thinking, when
we stopped for gas this morning

50:57.427 --> 51:00.225
I think it was you who put the oil in.

51:00.226 --> 51:03.125
Hey, if you're gonna say I didn't
put the right kind, then you're wrong.

51:03.126 --> 51:05.124
I used 10W-30.

51:05.125 --> 51:08.224
And besides, motor oil would have
nothing to do with this accident.

51:08.225 --> 51:12.624
True. But you can't latch the hood
too well if you don't take the can out

51:12.625 --> 51:15.924
you no-selling waste of space!
I swear to God you're worthless.

51:15.925 --> 51:20.324
I'm sorry about your car.
But don't call me worthless.

51:20.325 --> 51:22.024
I'm trying my best.
I'm not my dad.

51:22.025 --> 51:23.722
That's right. You're not your dad.

51:23.723 --> 51:26.523
He could sell a ketchup popsicle
to a woman in white gloves.

51:26.524 --> 51:28.422
- Ketchup popsicle?
- Yeah.

51:28.423 --> 51:30.022
I learned everything I know from him.

51:30.023 --> 51:32.573
I didn't have a father,
and he looked out for me. But you!

51:32.574 --> 51:35.121
He was your real dad and you
just took it for granted.

51:35.122 --> 51:38.922
Hey, I'm big Tom's son, he'll fix
everything, so I'm allowed to be a moron.

51:38.923 --> 51:43.122
That's it! Get out of the car!
It's go time, you and me.

51:43.123 --> 51:47.321
Look Mommy, the rhino is
getting too close to the car.

51:47.322 --> 51:50.921
Him too 'fraid to get out.
He just a little guy.

51:50.922 --> 51:52.920
That's it big boy.
I'm gonna wail on you.

51:52.921 --> 51:55.521
You're gonna regret volunteering
for this job, Porky.

51:55.522 --> 51:57.719
Hey boys and girls,
it's Papa Smurf!

51:57.720 --> 51:59.419
You know what, you don't want
none of me, think it through.

51:59.420 --> 52:01.620
Come on, give me your best shot, and I'll
give you a free one! Let me have it!

52:03.420 --> 52:05.119
That's it?

52:05.120 --> 52:07.019
Come on, you can do better than that,
can't ya Captain Limp Wrist?

52:07.020 --> 52:08.219
Try again.

52:09.719 --> 52:12.119
Hey everybody, is there a
window open? I feel a draft.

52:15.319 --> 52:17.619
If I wanted a kiss,
I woulda called your mother.

52:20.118 --> 52:21.818
That was a good one.

52:24.518 --> 52:26.518
Prehistoric Forest...

52:39.916 --> 52:43.316
Richard, do I have a mark on my face?
It really hurts.

52:45.716 --> 52:49.016
No, nothing. I thought I
hit you on the shoulder.

52:49.716 --> 52:54.715
My shoulder doesn't hurt very much,
but my face does. Right here.

52:55.815 --> 52:59.115
Not here,
or here so much, but right here.

52:59.116 --> 53:00.815
Nope. Sheep shape.

53:01.615 --> 53:06.014
Waitress could I get that shrimp
cocktail I saw on the glass case?

53:06.015 --> 53:10.414
Yeah. And you... What can I get-
Jesus, what happened to your face?

53:10.415 --> 53:14.412
I knew it. See, Richard?
I'll have chicken wings.

53:14.413 --> 53:17.612
Kitchen's closed until dinner.
I just got cold stuff and desserts.

53:17.613 --> 53:21.913
Boy, some chicken wings would really
hit the spot. You sure it's closed?

53:23.313 --> 53:26.311
Let me check.
Yup, it's closed.

53:26.312 --> 53:30.212
Okay. I'll just have
a sugar packet or two.

53:30.213 --> 53:33.612
- Hey, what's your name?
- Helen.

53:33.613 --> 53:37.010
That's nice.
You look like a Helen.

53:37.011 --> 53:42.511
Helen, we're both in sales. Let me
tell you why I suck as a salesman.

53:42.512 --> 53:44.610
Let's say I go into some guy's office

53:44.611 --> 53:47.609
let's say he's even remotely
interested in buying something.

53:47.610 --> 53:50.810
Well, then I get all excited, I'm
like Jo-Jo, the idiot circus-boy,

53:50.811 --> 53:55.109
with a pretty new pet.
The pet is my possible sale.

53:55.110 --> 53:59.709
Oh, my pretty little pet. I love you!

53:59.710 --> 54:04.309
So I stroke it, and I
pet it, and I massage it.

54:04.310 --> 54:09.508
I love it, I love my little
naughty pet. You're naughty.

54:09.509 --> 54:13.508
And then I take my
naughty pet, and I go...

54:19.008 --> 54:23.407
I killed it!
I killed my sale!

54:24.607 --> 54:26.106
That's when I blow it.

54:26.107 --> 54:28.807
That's when people like us have got
to forge head, Helen. Am I right?

54:32.206 --> 54:35.806
God, you're sick. Tell you what,

54:35.807 --> 54:39.406
I'll go turn the friers back on
and throw some wings in for ya.

54:39.407 --> 54:43.705
Thanks, Helen. Tommy like-y.
Tommy want wing-y.

54:43.706 --> 54:48.005
Did that board to the head
knock something loose?

54:48.006 --> 54:49.404
What are you talking about?

54:49.405 --> 54:51.205
That 180 you just
pulled at the waitress.

54:51.206 --> 54:52.604
Why can't you sell like that?

54:52.605 --> 54:55.704
I'm just having fun.
If we didn't get the wings, so what?

54:55.705 --> 54:58.103
We still got that meat-lovers'
pizza in the trunk.

54:58.104 --> 55:02.503
You got the wings cause you're relaxed.
You had confidence.

55:02.504 --> 55:05.803
And that's what it takes to sell.
Confidence. Your dad had that.

55:05.804 --> 55:08.903
Why do you always have
to de-turd this things?

55:08.904 --> 55:10.702
My dad was smart, I'm not.

55:10.703 --> 55:13.302
Very true. But there's
two types of smarts,

55:13.303 --> 55:16.002
book smarts, which waved bye-bye
to you long ago,

55:16.003 --> 55:18.702
and there's street-smarts,
the ability to read people.

55:18.703 --> 55:21.101
And you know how to do that,
just like your dad.

55:21.102 --> 55:23.102
He was the best at knowing
what people wanted to hear,

55:23.103 --> 55:25.102
and what people needed to hear.

55:25.103 --> 55:26.800
That's what selling is all about.

55:26.801 --> 55:30.701
In a way, these people are
buying you, not just brake pads.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.901
Hey everybody, it's Tony Robbins!

55:34.701 --> 55:37.499
- Maybe you're right, Richard.
- I think I am.

55:37.500 --> 55:41.500
Holy Lord, look at this guy, caught
him right after thanksgiving feast.

55:41.501 --> 55:45.200
- Nice, Richard.
- Now I need a Pooper-Scooper.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.198
I like your line.
And I like your prices.

55:54.199 --> 55:57.998
But there's a problem.
There's no guarantee on the box.

55:57.999 --> 56:01.698
If they break down, you can call
me at home, even if I'm watching TV.

56:01.699 --> 56:05.297
Callahan has guaranteed
every part sold since 1925.

56:05.298 --> 56:09.098
Maybe so, but it's not on the box.
It should always be on the box.

56:09.099 --> 56:12.897
Comforting you, calling out
"I'm good. I'll never let you down."

56:12.898 --> 56:15.196
"But if I do, I'm gonna
make all things better."

56:15.197 --> 56:17.847
Our brake pads are made of
a non-corrosive poly-plated...

56:17.848 --> 56:20.496
Son, if you're not talking
about a guarantee, skip it.

56:20.497 --> 56:22.496
My customers need to see that little
label, lookin' at 'em right in the eye.

56:22.497 --> 56:26.596
- Hey, you can get a good look at your butcher...
- No.

56:26.597 --> 56:27.495
What?

56:27.496 --> 56:29.995
- Remember, chicken wings.
- Chicken wings?

56:29.996 --> 56:31.596
Alright, uh, you wanna talk
about guarantees, then...

56:31.597 --> 56:33.595
Fellas, you just ran out of time.

56:37.095 --> 56:38.894
Chicken wings.

56:38.895 --> 56:41.094
Let's think about
this for a sec, Ted.

56:41.095 --> 56:46.494
Why would someone put a guarantee
on a box? Hmm, very interesting.

56:46.495 --> 56:47.893
Go on! I'm listening.

56:47.894 --> 56:49.693
Here's the way I see it, Ted.

56:49.694 --> 56:53.394
A guy puts a fancy guarantee on the box 'cause
he wants you to feel all warm and toasty inside.

56:53.395 --> 56:57.293
- Yeah, makes a man feel good.
- Of course it does. Why shouldn't it?

56:57.294 --> 57:01.193
You figure you put that little box
under your pillow at night, the Guarantee Fairy

57:01.194 --> 57:03.993
might come down and leave
a quarter, am I right, Ted?

57:05.493 --> 57:06.791
What's your point?

57:06.792 --> 57:10.091
The point is, how do you know
the fairy isn't a crazy glue sniffer?

57:10.092 --> 57:13.392
"Building model airplanes" says the
little fairy. Well, we're not buying it.

57:13.393 --> 57:15.791
He sneaks into your house once,
that's all it takes.

57:15.792 --> 57:17.891
Next thing you know there's money missing
off the dresser and your daughter

57:17.892 --> 57:20.641
is knocked up.
I've seen it a hundred times.

57:20.642 --> 57:23.390
But why do they put a
guarantee on the box then?

57:23.391 --> 57:26.590
'Cause they know all they sold
you was a guaranteed piece of shit.

57:26.591 --> 57:30.090
That's all it is, isn't it? Hey, if
you want me to take a dump in a box

57:30.091 --> 57:32.489
and mark it "guaranteed", I will.
I got spare time.

57:32.490 --> 57:35.590
But for now, for your customers' sake,
for your daughter's sake

57:35.591 --> 57:38.690
you might wanna think about
buying a quality product from me.

57:41.189 --> 57:42.839
Okay, I'll buy from you.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.489
- Well I...
- What?!

57:47.589 --> 57:50.688
He's made one deal, Paul.
It's not the end of the world.

57:50.689 --> 57:53.787
What would be good for us?
We wanna sell the factory.

57:53.788 --> 57:56.588
They're not gonna sell the factory
as long as Tommy keeps making sales.

57:56.589 --> 57:58.687
Why don't you come to bed?

57:58.688 --> 58:02.586
I got it! What does every
factory need? Trucks.

58:02.587 --> 58:05.987
They make stuff. They gotta ship it.
It's most simple.

58:05.988 --> 58:09.187
We stop the trucks,
we stop Tommy boy.

59:05.582 --> 59:06.982
Not good.

59:14.981 --> 59:18.480
Come on man, let's at least take five
minutes to celebrate our first victory!

59:18.481 --> 59:21.579
Look, we got lucky, don't jinx it.
We only have a week left

59:21.580 --> 59:25.280
before the loan's due. I gotta finish figuring
out our trips tonight, so we can jam out early.

59:25.281 --> 59:29.180
Okay, I'll tell you what. You work out that
scientific stuff, I'll go out and get a pizza.

59:29.181 --> 59:33.079
The only thing I need to figure out is
whether to get Chicago style or thin crust.

59:33.080 --> 59:35.679
The salesman has left the building.

59:37.179 --> 59:38.179
Chill bud.

59:56.777 --> 59:58.277
Oh, mamasita!

01:00:02.577 --> 01:00:03.675
Hi.

01:00:03.676 --> 01:00:06.075
Tommy, scram! Don't give her
the weight room thing!

01:00:06.076 --> 01:00:09.076
Do you know where the weight room is?
I'll check it out.

01:00:09.077 --> 01:00:10.976
Sorry.

01:00:13.975 --> 01:00:16.475
Oh, daddy likes! You get wet
honey, you deserve a swim...

01:00:16.476 --> 01:00:18.975
Now take off that itchy robe.

01:00:30.774 --> 01:00:34.474
Nobody's around.
It's naughty time.

01:00:39.773 --> 01:00:43.773
Oh, for the love of God, I've been patient.
Please, don't stop!

01:00:43.774 --> 01:00:45.873
You've been on the-
Oh, those are real!

01:00:48.872 --> 01:00:52.372
No one's looking.
Speaking of "no one's looking"...

01:00:55.672 --> 01:00:59.371
Bad girl.
Ah, thank you...

01:00:59.372 --> 01:01:00.571
I'm back.

01:01:04.571 --> 01:01:10.069
- Richard, what were you doing?
- Going over some documents.

01:01:10.070 --> 01:01:14.070
- Where are they? Geez, I don't see them.
- They're in my briefcase.

01:01:14.071 --> 01:01:16.369
- I thought you were getting pizza.
- They were closed.

01:01:16.370 --> 01:01:20.469
How could you be reading documents
when they're in your briefcase?

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.768
That's a mystery.

01:01:22.769 --> 01:01:28.868
- Were you watching "Spank-tro-Vision"?
- Ok then, let's hit it!

01:01:28.869 --> 01:01:32.868
Maybe you were watching a movie with
that funny comedian, oh, what's his name?

01:01:32.869 --> 01:01:34.867
Buddy Wackett?

01:01:34.868 --> 01:01:36.667
All right then,
let's get some shut eye!

01:01:36.668 --> 01:01:39.918
- Hey, that's a pretty girl down there.
- Good for her!

01:01:39.919 --> 01:01:43.167
Geez, I wonder if she goes out
with one of the "Yankees".

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:45.167
Couldn't tell ya.

01:01:53.267 --> 01:01:57.066
Big day tomorrow.
I hope we can keep this momentum going.

01:01:57.067 --> 01:01:58.866
Yup, that'd be good.

01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:09.665
Richard? Who's your favorite
little rascal? Alfalfa or is it Spanky?

01:02:12.765 --> 01:02:14.465
Sinner!

01:02:27.263 --> 01:02:29.462
Yes, I'll buy.

01:02:29.463 --> 01:02:30.963
Yes, I like what I hear.

01:02:30.964 --> 01:02:32.162
Yes, sounds good.

01:02:32.163 --> 01:02:35.363
By the way, did you ever
eat paint chips as a kid?

01:02:41.262 --> 01:02:43.462
Son of a...

01:02:52.661 --> 01:02:56.161
A thousand units to Oshkosh?
Tommy, that's fabulous!

01:02:56.162 --> 01:02:58.361
Your dad never sold a
thousand in Oshkosh.

01:02:58.362 --> 01:03:00.160
uh uh, since I've been here.

01:03:49.256 --> 01:03:52.256
Lord, I never had to tinkle
so bad in all my life.

01:03:56.655 --> 01:03:59.754
Richard! You're a riot!

01:03:59.755 --> 01:04:02.854
Stop the car! Son of a...

01:04:02.855 --> 01:04:05.655
What the hell's gotten
into you? My thing got

01:04:05.656 --> 01:04:08.454
stuck in the zipper, I
got piss all over my pants.

01:04:29.552 --> 01:04:32.352
Ok, thanks. Bye, I owe you.

01:04:35.152 --> 01:04:37.752
Oh, there you are. While I was waiting
I thought I'd make a couple calls.

01:04:37.753 --> 01:04:39.751
Okay, mom, I'll call you
later then, bye bye.

01:04:41.851 --> 01:04:43.451
What do you want?

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:48.651
I just wanted to tell you that Tommy's
been talking a lot about you recently

01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.650
and well, thought you
might wanna know that.

01:04:50.651 --> 01:04:52.049
God, he's so sweet.

01:04:52.050 --> 01:04:55.050
You've no idea how much it means
having you and your mom as family.

01:04:55.051 --> 01:04:57.549
He says the sweetest things about her.

01:04:57.550 --> 01:05:01.748
Everything he does is sweet.
So, when does sweetie get back?

01:05:01.749 --> 01:05:04.949
This Friday. Which is great, because
we're backed up on orders as it is.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:08.048
He's turned into this...
selling machine.

01:05:08.049 --> 01:05:10.349
Well, between that and the sweetness,
I'd say hang on to it.

01:05:16.348 --> 01:05:17.748
I gotta go.

01:05:21.848 --> 01:05:25.947
Yes, sir. I can have that for you tomorrow.
Well, that'd be great. Thank you sir.

01:05:40.446 --> 01:05:43.946
- Housekeeping.
- No, thank you. Sleeping.

01:05:45.046 --> 01:05:48.645
- Housekeeping.
- Could you come back here in an hour?

01:05:50.245 --> 01:05:54.945
- Housekeeping. You want towel?
- No towels, need sleepy.

01:05:55.645 --> 01:05:58.894
Housekeeping. You
want mint for pillow?

01:05:58.895 --> 01:06:02.144
Please, go away! Let me
sleep, for the love of God!

01:06:03.344 --> 01:06:06.344
Housekeeping. You want me jerk you off?

01:06:07.744 --> 01:06:11.743
What kind of hotel is this.
what the hell are- Oh, it's you.

01:06:11.744 --> 01:06:13.342
Good morning, sunshine.

01:06:13.343 --> 01:06:16.743
Hey, guess what, I just called "Auto Tech"
and they decided to make an order.

01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:19.842
So according to my calculations,
that puts us over the mark.

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:23.141
- We did it?
- We did.

01:06:23.142 --> 01:06:26.542
Oh, Richard, I'm so happy!
Hold me!

01:06:26.543 --> 01:06:29.942
Don't run away from your feelings!

01:07:55.334 --> 01:07:58.084
Something went haywire down
at shipping and receiving.

01:07:58.085 --> 01:08:00.833
Your shipments got
screwed up in the computer,

01:08:00.834 --> 01:08:03.933
the wrong parts went to the wrong cities.
Now all hell's broken lose.

01:08:03.934 --> 01:08:05.532
I don't believe this.

01:08:05.533 --> 01:08:08.033
Ok, so we call everyone
and explain what happened.

01:08:08.034 --> 01:08:10.132
Half the orders have
already been cancelled.

01:08:10.133 --> 01:08:11.731
What?!

01:08:11.732 --> 01:08:14.231
They think it's an indication
of how things work around here.

01:08:14.232 --> 01:08:17.432
The real problem is that we won't be
able to make the payment to the bank.

01:08:17.433 --> 01:08:19.432
It's like a bad "Twilight Zone".

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:21.430
I think I'm growing a tumor.

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:23.930
Look, we talk to the bank.
Maybe they'll give us a break.

01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:26.331
We've been doing business
with them for 23 years.

01:08:26.332 --> 01:08:28.731
Tommy, it's all over.

01:08:28.732 --> 01:08:32.529
You made a valiant effort, but
we're gonna have to sell to Zalinsky.

01:08:32.531 --> 01:08:35.328
I'm flying to Chicago
to sign over the company.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.529
- What's gonna happen to the factory?
- He's gonna shut it down.

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.979
Zalinsky doesn't care
about our workers.

01:08:40.981 --> 01:08:43.429
He wants the Callahan name, that's all.

01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:45.328
Did anyone see "Scanners"?

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:49.328
Bottom line is, by 6pm tomorrow
we'll all be unemployed.

01:08:59.528 --> 01:09:03.228
Don't say anything, ok! I know I've
ruined your entire life, and you hate me,

01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:05.127
so let me pack my things
and go crawling through

01:09:05.127 --> 01:09:07.426
a dark hole for a few years.

01:09:07.428 --> 01:09:08.527
Hi.

01:09:13.227 --> 01:09:15.727
- So, do you hate me?
- I just don't get it.

01:09:15.728 --> 01:09:18.625
I guaranteed overnight delivery.

01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:21.926
- We faxed to our shipping addresses, didn't we?
- Yes.

01:09:21.926 --> 01:09:25.225
And they were right when I put
them into my computer. I swear.

01:09:25.227 --> 01:09:28.075
And how could-
Oh, man! This was so big!

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:30.925
I know it was big,
but it wasn't my fault.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:36.625
Why can't you put your files in the
file cabinet like everybody else, uh?

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:40.323
I mean, maybe if you weren't such
a rebel, you could've avoided...

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:43.524
Don't worry because I've quit. So you
won't have to put up with anything anymore.

01:09:45.024 --> 01:09:47.724
Michelle, wait!
Come on, please!

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:58.122
Thanks. Have a good flight.
May I help you?

01:09:58.123 --> 01:10:01.321
Hi, I called about a ticket
to Cuyahoga Falls, the name's Brock.

01:10:01.322 --> 01:10:04.022
Right. That flight goes through Columbus.
Let me just call that up for you.

01:10:11.322 --> 01:10:12.921
Excuse me.

01:10:20.921 --> 01:10:23.720
Hello, is detective Duane Brock
on duty today?

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.219
This town doesn't even know
what's about to hit it.

01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:33.819
Fish in a barrel, my man.
Town's the fish, people are the barrel.

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:35.519
Fish in a barrel...

01:10:40.619 --> 01:10:43.019
What's wrong with you, Richard?
You can't drink in a car.

01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:44.618
Don't you know we could
get busted for that?

01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:49.218
I'm sorry. I need not know that.
Right now we got a bigger problem.

01:10:49.219 --> 01:10:51.218
- That is?
- Beer's coming back up.

01:10:51.219 --> 01:10:52.718
Oh, Lord!

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.217
Here we go!

01:10:58.617 --> 01:10:59.816
Cops!

01:10:59.817 --> 01:11:02.216
Dammit, Richard.
The whole car smells like beer.

01:11:02.217 --> 01:11:05.917
They're never gonna believe
I wasn't drinking. Hold on!

01:11:07.016 --> 01:11:09.216
- What are you doing?
- I got an idea.

01:11:11.916 --> 01:11:13.016
What the hell?

01:11:13.916 --> 01:11:16.116
When I stop the car,
run out screaming.

01:11:16.117 --> 01:11:17.116
No problem.

01:11:21.815 --> 01:11:23.515
Little trick my dad taught me.

01:11:28.815 --> 01:11:34.613
Bees! Bees! Bees in the car!
Bees everywhere!

01:11:34.614 --> 01:11:38.314
God, they're huge!
They're ripping my flesh!

01:11:39.114 --> 01:11:42.412
Son, roll around!
Do you hear me?

01:11:42.413 --> 01:11:45.513
- Roll around on the ground!
- Forget that, I'm starting to swell up!

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:48.613
Save yourself, Tommy!
Don't be the hero!

01:11:48.614 --> 01:11:51.712
- Frank, I'm allergic to bees.
- Me too.

01:11:51.713 --> 01:11:53.911
They're huge and they sting crazy!

01:11:53.912 --> 01:11:55.712
We'll come back
later to check on you.

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:57.811
Save yourselves!

01:11:57.812 --> 01:12:00.012
Your firearms are useless against them!

01:12:04.811 --> 01:12:06.810
Holy shnikees, it worked!

01:12:06.811 --> 01:12:13.710
I just barfed in an anthill.
Cool! Wow, I think they're pissed.

01:12:17.310 --> 01:12:19.109
Yeah. That's the answer.

01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:22.810
Doesn't look like the answer.
I don't remember eating that.

01:12:22.811 --> 01:12:26.509
No! Zalinsky. We go to Chicago,
tell him we're not for sale.

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:29.308
He seems like a good guy on TV.
He'll understand.

01:12:29.309 --> 01:12:34.609
You're dreaming. You can't stop him.
You lost your shares to the bank, remember?

01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.808
What the hell? In less than 24 hours
I'll lose the factory anyway.

01:12:37.809 --> 01:12:40.008
So why not give it a shot?

01:12:40.708 --> 01:12:43.908
- Chicago?
- Chicago.

01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:56.607
- You can't park here!
- Keep it!

01:12:56.608 --> 01:12:58.105
Where are you going?

01:12:58.106 --> 01:13:00.905
Leave me a message and
I'll get back to you. Thanks.

01:13:00.906 --> 01:13:06.306
Hi, Michelle. This is Tommy.
Listen, I'm sorry about what I said.

01:13:06.307 --> 01:13:11.705
I was being an idiot. I wanna
apologize cause, I didn't mean it.

01:13:12.805 --> 01:13:16.405
Anyway, me and Richard are going
to Chicago, to straighten things out.

01:13:16.406 --> 01:13:19.005
The next flight to Chicago
boards in five minutes but

01:13:19.006 --> 01:13:21.303
I'm sorry, it's completely sold out.

01:13:21.304 --> 01:13:25.003
I can put you on another one
at 3 o' clock this afternoon.

01:13:25.004 --> 01:13:29.204
Lady, we really need to get to Chicago.
It's an emergency. Is there anything you can do?

01:13:30.803 --> 01:13:33.903
I can put you in to
Salt Lake City, by 4...

01:13:35.803 --> 01:13:38.803
I don't have time to go thru another city.
I need a direct flight to Chicago.

01:13:39.703 --> 01:13:44.102
Oh, I can reserve you a flight
coming back from Chicago at 17.55...

01:13:44.103 --> 01:13:45.001
Does that help?

01:13:45.002 --> 01:13:47.202
Hi. I'm Earth.
Have we met?

01:13:47.203 --> 01:13:48.802
I don't think so.

01:13:49.902 --> 01:13:52.202
So, I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye.

01:13:52.901 --> 01:13:56.401
We're screwed. No tickets
to Chicago. Not even stand- by.

01:13:56.402 --> 01:13:58.301
There's gotta be something we can do.

01:13:59.901 --> 01:14:04.900
Wait a minute! You got any money?
Cause I got a plan!

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.500
We're gonna get busted,
let's get out of here!

01:14:14.501 --> 01:14:15.498
Too late.

01:14:15.499 --> 01:14:17.098
Hey, guess who's here!

01:14:17.099 --> 01:14:20.299
What are we serving tonight,
chicken or... chicken?

01:14:21.599 --> 01:14:24.299
What a nice surprise! They said we
were gonna be short-handed this leg.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:27.098
You two take coach. Oh, and could
you handle the announcements?

01:14:27.099 --> 01:14:28.797
Okey dokey. No problemo.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.598
They're gonna know we're bogus.

01:14:30.599 --> 01:14:32.397
Relax! You get on the horn!

01:14:32.398 --> 01:14:34.598
I throw some peanuts at 'em.
We'll be in Chicago before you know it.

01:14:39.897 --> 01:14:42.447
Ok, folks, the guy in
front of you is Tommy.

01:14:42.448 --> 01:14:44.997
He'll be taking you through
my little spiel here.

01:14:44.998 --> 01:14:48.896
Tommy is a Scorpio, he likes biking,
and he's never been laid.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:54.246
Exits! Ok, there's one back here,

01:14:54.247 --> 01:14:56.796
and there's probably one
over by the wing, somewhere,

01:14:56.797 --> 01:15:00.094
usually.
And what about seat belts?

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:03.294
To fasten, take the little end
and stick it in the big end.

01:15:03.295 --> 01:15:06.045
You know what, if you guys
don't know how to use a seat belt,

01:15:06.046 --> 01:15:08.795
just ring the call button and Tommy will
come back there and hit you on the head

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.594
with a tack hammer
cause you are a retard.

01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:14.394
Ok, and life preservers.
These we may need.

01:15:14.395 --> 01:15:15.894
Although what are the odds

01:15:15.895 --> 01:15:17.393
of us actually hitting a lake?

01:15:17.394 --> 01:15:19.593
My money says if anything,
it's gonna be a mountain.

01:15:19.594 --> 01:15:23.093
To inflate, put it around your
neck and yank down on the tab.

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:29.693
Son of a!
I can't breathe!

01:15:29.694 --> 01:15:31.193
Chocking!

01:15:37.992 --> 01:15:40.292
He's a big dumb animal,
isn't he folks?

01:15:42.692 --> 01:15:44.991
Folks, we're making our final
approach into Chicago.

01:15:46.091 --> 01:15:49.491
Ma'am, are you still alive?

01:15:49.492 --> 01:15:52.891
Ma'am there's a half hour time limit.

01:16:09.089 --> 01:16:12.989
Ok, now, we're running out of time,
so you can't go see Zalinsky like that.

01:16:12.990 --> 01:16:14.489
Now go change!

01:16:19.488 --> 01:16:20.488
Go!

01:17:14.383 --> 01:17:16.783
Fasten your seat belt.

01:17:32.382 --> 01:17:34.881
I'm okay. I'm fine, I'm fine now.

01:17:47.380 --> 01:17:50.879
- What are you doing?
- I'm nervous so I'm sweating.

01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:54.480
You're gonna smell like a cab driver.
Not to say that that's bad.

01:17:54.481 --> 01:17:56.679
I wanna be fresh for the meeting.

01:17:56.680 --> 01:17:58.779
Well, you look good. Are you ready?

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.879
Ready or not, this is crunch time.

01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.979
525... That's it!

01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:09.577
Son of a... That's gonna leave a mark.

01:18:09.578 --> 01:18:14.677
- Whoa, look at this place!
- Welcome to the Pros.

01:18:14.678 --> 01:18:19.977
Oh my God, it's him! There he is,
my friend. The King himself.

01:18:22.377 --> 01:18:25.177
Let's do it! It's go time.

01:18:31.276 --> 01:18:32.375
Where did he go?

01:18:32.376 --> 01:18:34.476
I don't know. You check the elevators,
I'll check the bank.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.075
Where is he? where is he?

01:18:47.175 --> 01:18:50.175
Listen up! This'll only take a second!

01:19:02.973 --> 01:19:05.373
- Wow, what's going on down here?
- Walk slow!

01:19:05.374 --> 01:19:07.972
- Okay. Why?
- Nothing.

01:19:07.973 --> 01:19:11.273
- Am I consorting with a known felon?
- Shut up, Richard!

01:19:11.274 --> 01:19:13.573
Hey mom! It's the guy
who robbed the bank!

01:19:13.574 --> 01:19:15.371
I didn't rob any bank.

01:19:15.372 --> 01:19:19.372
Oh, yeah, right. Like there was
other real fat guy with a tiny head.

01:19:20.572 --> 01:19:22.072
I got a tiny head?

01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:28.171
Zalinsky.

01:19:32.071 --> 01:19:33.471
Say something!

01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:40.970
Mr. Zalinsky? I'm Tommy Callahan.
Big Tom Callahan's son.

01:19:41.970 --> 01:19:44.770
Sorry to hear about your dad.
He was a good man.

01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:49.969
Went a little heavy on the
pine tree perfume there, kid.

01:19:50.969 --> 01:19:53.068
Sir, it's a taxi cab air-freshener.

01:19:53.069 --> 01:19:55.769
Great, you've pinpointed it.
Step two is washing it off.

01:19:57.469 --> 01:19:59.368
Sir, what exactly happened here?

01:19:59.369 --> 01:20:01.267
He came out of the shadows behind me

01:20:01.268 --> 01:20:04.768
and after he hit me many many
times in the head, with a hammer

01:20:04.769 --> 01:20:06.967
I had to give him my gun,
you know, I've got kids.

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:11.167
So as more details emerge on
this attempted bank robbery,

01:20:11.168 --> 01:20:12.866
Action 8 will be there.

01:20:12.867 --> 01:20:15.367
But the "Callahan" factory's
been in my family for 70 years,

01:20:15.368 --> 01:20:17.867
you can't just shut it down.

01:20:17.868 --> 01:20:20.267
Son, you gotta look at it
from my point of view.

01:20:20.268 --> 01:20:22.665
Callahan's a premium name.
That's what I'm buying.

01:20:22.666 --> 01:20:25.966
I can make the parts in one of my
factories, put 'em in a Callahan box

01:20:25.967 --> 01:20:27.165
and sell 'em in my stores.

01:20:27.166 --> 01:20:30.965
At a premium price. Why keep your factory
going when all I want is the goddamned box?

01:20:30.966 --> 01:20:33.615
I'll tell you why. Cause
there's a town involved here.

01:20:33.616 --> 01:20:36.265
Callahan factory is the
only thing keeping it alive.

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:38.165
Look, believe it or not,
I'm providing a service.

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.065
I'm thinning the corporate herd.

01:20:40.066 --> 01:20:42.364
You've seen "Daktari"?
The weaker animals always go.

01:20:42.365 --> 01:20:45.064
So the kids cry when you tie an old
tiger to a tree and shoot him.

01:20:45.065 --> 01:20:47.563
But that's life!
America's in a state of renewal.

01:20:47.564 --> 01:20:50.464
We've gotta have the strength to
tie a few factories to a tree

01:20:50.465 --> 01:20:51.663
and bash 'em with a shovel.

01:20:51.664 --> 01:20:54.062
Meanwhile, if I can grab
your share of the market,

01:20:54.063 --> 01:20:55.913
put a little coin in the
pocket, by being the asshole?

01:20:55.914 --> 01:20:57.763
Well, what the hell,
you know what I mean?

01:20:59.263 --> 01:21:01.063
Boy, you sure are different
in your TV commercials.

01:21:01.064 --> 01:21:03.562
What the American public
doesn't know

01:21:03.563 --> 01:21:06.162
is what makes them
the American public, alright?

01:21:09.962 --> 01:21:11.761
God, I love that!

01:21:11.762 --> 01:21:14.962
Hell, folks believe me when I tell them: we're
not just building automotive components here

01:21:14.963 --> 01:21:17.161
we're adding horsepower
to the American industry.

01:21:24.361 --> 01:21:26.960
You say a word to anyone and I
will kill you. Do you understand me?

01:21:26.961 --> 01:21:28.560
It looks real.

01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:34.459
Yeah, television's been
good to me, son.

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.159
I make car parts for the American
working man, because that's what I am

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:40.859
and that's who I care about.

01:21:43.259 --> 01:21:45.958
The truth is I make car parts
for the American working man

01:21:45.959 --> 01:21:48.458
because I'm a hell of a salesman,
and he doesn't know any better.

01:21:48.459 --> 01:21:51.458
Well, son, since you're no longer the
shareholder, this is where I leave you.

01:21:51.459 --> 01:21:52.757
Don't feel bad.

01:21:52.758 --> 01:21:55.008
This chain of events was set in
motion a long long time ago.

01:21:55.009 --> 01:21:57.258
You and your bald headed friend,
you did what you could,

01:21:57.259 --> 01:21:58.257
that's commendable.

01:21:58.258 --> 01:22:00.057
Marty, have security
see these boys out!

01:22:00.757 --> 01:22:02.357
Mrs. Callahan.

01:22:06.357 --> 01:22:08.457
What's my family doing in there?

01:22:19.156 --> 01:22:20.855
I thought they were on my side.

01:22:20.856 --> 01:22:23.154
They had a lot to gain
if the factory was sold.

01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:25.705
Boy, did I screw up.

01:22:25.706 --> 01:22:28.255
My so-called family deserted me.

01:22:28.256 --> 01:22:30.705
Michelle's mad at me.
I lost the factory.

01:22:30.706 --> 01:22:33.155
The town's going under
and I'm out of a job.

01:22:35.154 --> 01:22:38.454
Could have done without that.
Geez, I'm an idiot!

01:22:40.954 --> 01:22:42.904
Boy, I sure let my dad down.

01:22:42.905 --> 01:22:44.853
You tried as hard as you could.

01:22:45.853 --> 01:22:49.253
When we first started out I thought you'd just walk
through this like you walked through everything else.

01:22:49.254 --> 01:22:52.353
But you didn't. So your dad
would've been proud o'you.

01:22:53.853 --> 01:22:55.351
And you got a friend out of it.

01:22:55.352 --> 01:22:58.552
Now, I know it doesn't matter
cause you have so many, but uh...

01:23:00.152 --> 01:23:01.452
... I don't.

01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:05.252
Thanks man.

01:23:07.551 --> 01:23:08.951
Tommy.

01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:12.150
Michelle!

01:23:12.151 --> 01:23:14.251
- Don't tell her about my hair!
- Let it go!

01:23:14.252 --> 01:23:16.050
God, I was worried I wouldn't find you.

01:23:16.051 --> 01:23:18.250
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- I got your message.

01:23:18.251 --> 01:23:20.949
Okay, I was at the airport.
I was going home.

01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:23.950
And I saw your step-brother and your
step- mother, and he was kissing her.

01:23:23.951 --> 01:23:25.750
- So?
- With his tongue.

01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:30.148
- Doing his mommy?
- She's not his mom. They're married.

01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:33.249
They were lying to your dad the whole time.
And my brother got these police reports.

01:23:33.250 --> 01:23:34.148
See?

01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:35.148
They lied to my dad?

01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:36.749
They're con artists.
They suckered him.

01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:38.349
They lied to my dad.

01:23:47.548 --> 01:23:51.947
Richard, I'm gonna need your watch.
I've got a plan.

01:24:04.546 --> 01:24:07.646
Folks, Mr. Zalinsky gave us specific
instructions to bar you from the building.

01:24:07.647 --> 01:24:10.546
Sorry boys.
Hopefully we'll just be in and out.

01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:11.645
My God, he's wired!

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:14.345
And uh, no cops.
Wouldn't want things to get messy.

01:24:20.245 --> 01:24:21.844
- That was fun.
- Now what?

01:24:21.845 --> 01:24:24.644
Well, it's 6 o'clock,
time for the news.

01:24:26.644 --> 01:24:28.844
Excuse me!
Oh God.

01:24:33.244 --> 01:24:34.944
Done this before?

01:24:35.643 --> 01:24:36.943
Thank you, Marty.

01:24:43.243 --> 01:24:45.893
My, your hands move quickly!

01:24:45.894 --> 01:24:48.542
Only when I see something
I want, Mrs. Callahan.

01:24:50.642 --> 01:24:52.442
Just doesn't seem right.

01:24:52.443 --> 01:24:54.341
Hi! Got a second?

01:24:54.342 --> 01:24:57.141
- What the hell's going on?
- Oh, my God, we're gonna die!

01:24:57.142 --> 01:24:58.340
Tommy, what are you doing?

01:24:58.341 --> 01:25:00.241
Hi, Ted. Hi, Frank.
Excuse me, Marty.

01:25:00.242 --> 01:25:01.640
Okay, we're live.

01:25:01.641 --> 01:25:04.741
We now switch live to our reporter
who's at the scene with the bomber.

01:25:04.742 --> 01:25:06.441
This is Nicole Taylor,
live from Chicago.

01:25:06.442 --> 01:25:08.041
Hey, look! It's Tommy!

01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.240
Nicole, I've got something to say.
Please, may I?

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.940
Hi. This is Tommy Callahan
here with Mr. Ray Zalinsky,

01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:17.239
American auto-parts king.

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.139
Honey, look at this
human-bomb on the news!

01:25:21.439 --> 01:25:24.439
Oh yeah, I buy brake pads off him.
I thought we were watching cartoons.

01:25:26.139 --> 01:25:29.038
Mr. Zalinsky, for years you've
been putting ads on TV.

01:25:29.039 --> 01:25:34.938
And they always end up with you saying:
"I make car parts for..." How does that go?

01:25:37.238 --> 01:25:41.338
I make car parts for the American
working man, because that's what I am

01:25:41.339 --> 01:25:42.836
and that's who I care about.

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:46.737
That's why I'm here, Ray.
You see, back in Sandusky, Ohio,

01:25:46.738 --> 01:25:49.437
there are 300 American
workers at "Callahan Auto".

01:25:49.438 --> 01:25:51.236
We make the best parts money can buy.

01:25:51.237 --> 01:25:54.236
And right now those workers are
in danger of losing their jobs.

01:25:54.237 --> 01:25:56.836
They're praying that somebody's
gonna step up and help 'em.

01:25:56.837 --> 01:25:58.986
Is that why you've strapped
a bomb to your chest?

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.136
Oh, this isn't a bomb.
These are road flares.

01:26:01.137 --> 01:26:02.735
Road flares?

01:26:02.736 --> 01:26:05.035
Did you live under power lines
as a kid or something?

01:26:05.036 --> 01:26:06.534
Why?

01:26:06.535 --> 01:26:08.635
Do you guys want this
or "American Gladiators"?

01:26:08.636 --> 01:26:10.534
"Gladiators".

01:26:10.535 --> 01:26:13.335
So, do you think "Zalinsky Industries"
can help these folks?

01:26:13.336 --> 01:26:15.634
I'll be happy to look into it.

01:26:17.734 --> 01:26:20.934
I'll tell you what, I can get a good look at
a T-bone by sticking my head up a bull's ass,

01:26:20.935 --> 01:26:23.034
but I'd rather take
the butcher's word for it.

01:26:24.734 --> 01:26:28.133
Am I just severely wasted
or does Tommy look bloated?

01:26:28.134 --> 01:26:31.533
No, it's TV, man.
Camera adds a couple... 100 pounds.

01:26:32.733 --> 01:26:36.333
Ray, we're not looking for a handout here.
I'm offering you a great deal.

01:26:36.334 --> 01:26:39.732
This is an order for half-a-million
"Callahan" brake pads,

01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:41.232
to be sold in your stores.

01:26:41.732 --> 01:26:45.732
Made by the American working man,
for the American working man.

01:26:50.431 --> 01:26:54.231
Absolutely. It'd be my great pleasure.
What have I got to lose?

01:26:54.232 --> 01:26:56.030
A great American product, right?

01:26:56.031 --> 01:26:59.030
I don't believe it. Tommy just
sold half a million brake pads.

01:26:59.031 --> 01:27:03.530
Tommy just sold a
half million brake pads!

01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:12.929
What difference does it make? The company's
gonna be mine in ten minutes anyway. Right?

01:27:15.529 --> 01:27:17.628
Mr. Zalinsky, thank you.

01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:20.028
Thank you Tommy boy.
And thank you.

01:27:20.029 --> 01:27:23.228
And remember you can pick up these
great brake pads from "Callahan Auto"

01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:27.028
all my "Zalinsky Auto Parts"
outlets all over North America!

01:27:27.029 --> 01:27:28.427
Bravo, Tommy!

01:27:28.428 --> 01:27:32.427
For the moment it looks like a tragedy
has been eluded and a town has been saved.

01:27:32.428 --> 01:27:35.227
For Action News, I'm Nicole Taylor,
reporting live.

01:27:37.327 --> 01:27:38.626
Okay, we're out of here!

01:27:38.627 --> 01:27:41.327
Wait a minute, fat boy!
You lost your shares to the bank.

01:27:41.328 --> 01:27:43.225
You don't even have
a right to be here.

01:27:43.226 --> 01:27:45.576
Gee, funny you should bring that up.

01:27:45.577 --> 01:27:47.926
'Cause I'm not sure that you
have the right to be here.

01:27:47.927 --> 01:27:51.826
What have we got here?
Oh my God, it's a police report!

01:27:51.827 --> 01:27:53.925
- What's all this about?
- Let's see!

01:27:53.926 --> 01:27:57.025
Paul Barrish, married
May 1993 to Beverly Barrish,

01:27:57.026 --> 01:27:59.625
a.k.a. Beverly Burns.
Richard, how could Beverly

01:27:59.626 --> 01:28:02.225
be married to Paul
and my dad at the same time?

01:28:02.226 --> 01:28:04.125
- Interesting.
- Yes. Provocative.

01:28:05.624 --> 01:28:08.424
Well, I think it means that your
marriage to my dad was never legal.

01:28:08.425 --> 01:28:10.823
Which also means that Beverly's
shares still belong to Tommy.

01:28:10.824 --> 01:28:13.724
- Isn't that right, Mr. Rittenhauer?
- Yes. I believe that's right.

01:28:13.725 --> 01:28:15.424
- Mr. Railly?
- I'd say that's right.

01:28:15.425 --> 01:28:16.823
- Mr. Gilmore?
- Oh, absolutely.

01:28:18.123 --> 01:28:22.623
And let me guess, you're not going to be
selling me the company now, are you Tommy boy?

01:28:22.624 --> 01:28:24.322
No sir.

01:28:24.323 --> 01:28:26.623
Ray, I have no idea what
they're talking about.

01:28:26.624 --> 01:28:29.722
That's it! You're not gonna take this.

01:28:29.723 --> 01:28:31.521
It's not over yet, Lee Harvey.

01:28:31.522 --> 01:28:35.522
Let's see. Warrants outstanding!
New Mexico: mail fraud.

01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:37.221
Colorado: wire fraud.

01:28:37.222 --> 01:28:40.721
And coming soon to Ohio:
computer fraud.

01:28:44.721 --> 01:28:46.120
Get him!

01:28:46.121 --> 01:28:48.021
Don't let him leave the complex, Marty!

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:54.370
Hey, you forgot your wife!

01:28:54.371 --> 01:28:56.420
Screw you!
Screw all of you!

01:28:56.820 --> 01:29:00.420
Crash Test in Progress.

01:29:01.919 --> 01:29:03.318
Not good.

01:29:03.319 --> 01:29:04.619
Hit the brakes!

01:29:18.518 --> 01:29:20.468
That will ruin his weekend.

01:29:20.469 --> 01:29:22.417
Well kid, you threw one by me.

01:29:22.418 --> 01:29:25.017
Savour the flavour, cause it
sure as hell won't happen again.

01:29:25.018 --> 01:29:27.717
- In the meantime, good luck to you.
- Thank you sir.

01:29:27.718 --> 01:29:30.416
Marty, cut a check to Callahan
Auto for those brake pads!

01:29:30.417 --> 01:29:33.916
And you, with all this excitement around
here, I kinda' got a little hungry.

01:29:33.917 --> 01:29:36.416
Wanna step over to my club
and have something to eat?

01:29:40.916 --> 01:29:43.215
- Thank you. I'd like that.
- Good.

01:29:43.216 --> 01:29:45.014
Marty, find out where the
police will be taking him!

01:29:45.015 --> 01:29:47.515
send over a bottle of bubbly
with a bucket of ice and a card.

01:29:47.516 --> 01:29:49.414
Have it say:
"Tough break, get drunk on me...

01:29:49.415 --> 01:29:52.965
use the bucket to ice down
your marbles, yours Z."

01:29:52.966 --> 01:29:56.514
Well, Mr. Callahan, looks like
we're back in business.

01:29:56.515 --> 01:29:57.913
Yes sir, Mr. Rittenhauer.

01:29:57.914 --> 01:30:00.514
- That's great, Tommy!
- Thanks.

01:30:01.414 --> 01:30:03.514
Way to go, Tommy Callahan!

01:30:09.813 --> 01:30:13.613
- That was pathetic.
- Shut up, Richard!

01:30:16.513 --> 01:30:18.711
It's a very proud day for me.

01:30:18.712 --> 01:30:23.412
I want to introduce you to the
new president of "Callahan Auto",

01:30:23.413 --> 01:30:25.612
Tom Callahan Junior.

01:30:32.211 --> 01:30:34.311
Tommy, will you say something!

01:30:39.811 --> 01:30:43.210
Ever since I was a kid, you people
have been like a family to me.

01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:47.809
Louis, we built our
first fort together.

01:30:47.810 --> 01:30:51.609
And Danny, remember when we used
to burn ants with a magnifying glass?

01:30:53.809 --> 01:30:57.809
R.T., I lost my virginity to your
daughter, for crying out loud!

01:31:00.109 --> 01:31:01.709
Rob, you were there.

01:31:04.508 --> 01:31:07.508
Anyway, I just want you to know that
as long as I'm around, I'm gonna

01:31:07.509 --> 01:31:09.607
bust my butt and make sure that

01:31:09.608 --> 01:31:13.208
every last one of you always has
a job, right here at "Callahan".

01:31:41.405 --> 01:31:44.505
Dad, got a little problem here.

01:31:44.506 --> 01:31:47.604
I've been stuck here for
an hour with no wind again.

01:31:47.605 --> 01:31:49.204
I'm supposed to be
at Michelles' for dinner.

01:31:50.504 --> 01:31:53.404
So if you could give me a
little help, I'd appreciate it.

01:31:53.405 --> 01:31:55.404
If not, don't worry about it.

01:31:58.703 --> 01:32:00.603
I'm trying to do everything
I think you'd be doing,

01:32:00.604 --> 01:32:03.102
and so far it's going pretty good.

01:32:03.103 --> 01:32:06.703
I just wanna tell you that...
I still love you and

01:32:08.003 --> 01:32:10.202
I sure miss you a lot.

01:32:26.701 --> 01:32:29.401
Hey, thanks dad!

01:32:30.101 --> 01:32:33.300
Son of a...!
That's gonna leave a mark!

01:32:36.500 --> 01:32:40.600
The End.
