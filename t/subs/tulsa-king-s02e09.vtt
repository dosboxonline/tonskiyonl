00:06.174 --> 00:08.209
[Dwight] Last night,
an attempt was made

00:08.276 --> 00:09.810
on one of Bevilaqua's men.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.947
Lay low, figure out
what Kansas City's gonna do.

00:13.981 --> 00:16.317
-Shit just got real.
-We're gonna hit fucking Tulsa,

00:16.350 --> 00:17.851
we're gonna hit 'em hard.
You understand me?

00:17.918 --> 00:18.952
If it's the last
fucking thing I do,

00:18.986 --> 00:20.354
I'm getting rid of him.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.824
I think you should
go back to New York.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.493
You break my heart.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.161
I'm changing our agreement.

00:27.195 --> 00:27.961
What, are you
leaving the business?

00:27.995 --> 00:29.063
You are.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.034
[clicks tongue]

00:34.102 --> 00:35.136
What's this-- an intervention?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.137
You're being moved aside.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.538
Motherfucker!

00:37.571 --> 00:39.440
Bill Bevilaqua's
planning to make

00:39.473 --> 00:40.374
an attempt on your life.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.842
Don't know the guy.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.377
-You've been warned.
-Appreciate it.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.079
Good luck staying alive.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.848
You're not allowed
to be back here.

00:47.881 --> 00:51.018
Where you gonna go, huh?
Fucking Mars?!

00:51.051 --> 00:52.886
It was Ming
who tried to take him out

00:52.920 --> 00:55.323
by blowing up Manfredi,
and he missed.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.557
Do you know
what you fucking did?!

00:56.590 --> 00:57.525
-Hey--
-I'm in a fucking war right now

00:57.558 --> 00:58.726
because of you.

01:00.328 --> 01:01.362
[Bodhi]
Gun!

01:04.063 --> 01:06.066
Jimmy. Fuck!

01:08.269 --> 01:10.271
[men singing, chanting]

01:28.822 --> 01:31.592
Why do we smile in such sadness?

01:31.625 --> 01:33.727
Because of the memories

01:33.761 --> 01:36.564
of the laughter
that we shared in the past.

01:36.597 --> 01:39.433
Why is there such relief

01:39.467 --> 01:41.101
in sadness?

01:41.169 --> 01:44.771
Because there is a peace in it.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.808
There will never be fear again.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.544
-[Old Smoke continuing]
-Yo, is that Jimmy in there?

01:50.578 --> 01:52.746
Sure is, along with

01:52.780 --> 01:54.747
some of his personal belongings.

01:54.782 --> 01:57.951
All in accordance
with Native rituals, obviously.

01:57.985 --> 02:00.388
I sent him to the other side
with some moon rocks.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.290
What's he, Buzz Aldrin?

02:02.323 --> 02:04.825
There's definitely
a buzz involved.

02:04.892 --> 02:06.426
And he'll fly just as high.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.529
-Moon rocks are the best.
-[Old Smoke] Deep peace...

02:08.562 --> 02:11.332
Though we grieve his loss,

02:11.399 --> 02:14.134
we're grateful for the time
we had with you, Jimmy.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.069
That's very nice, Grace.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.606
-Thanks.
-[Old Smoke] The moon and stars

02:18.639 --> 02:20.641
-put their healing light on you.
-Jimmy'd appreciate it.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.312
Deep peace of Mother Earth

02:24.378 --> 02:27.715
and the four directions to you.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.318
[quiet, indistinct chatter]

02:34.454 --> 02:36.290
[Dwight]
This is definitely something

02:36.324 --> 02:37.891
you don't see in New York
every day.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.126
Hey, General.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.793
Ah.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.496
Sorry for your loss.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.366
We're all sorry.

02:45.433 --> 02:47.335
This...

02:47.401 --> 02:49.437
is for you.

02:49.470 --> 02:52.740
His mother, who's sick,
wanted you to have it.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.010
Thanks, but why me?

02:57.043 --> 02:59.813
She said Jimmy had great respect
for you as a leader.

02:59.847 --> 03:03.183
Well, thank you very much.

03:03.217 --> 03:05.619
I hope to put this to good use.

03:05.653 --> 03:08.622
The people who did this--
they have interest in marijuana?

03:09.623 --> 03:11.859
Yeah, well, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.461
There's a lot of 'em.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.129
They took out a guy who owned
a 10,000-acre weed farm.

03:16.163 --> 03:18.466
-[Dwight] Yeah.
-We want payback for this.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.869
I know. And that's
got to be settled soon.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.871
Yes, it does.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.039
-We're at war.
-Good.

03:26.073 --> 03:28.309
We have
the Maiule warriors here.

03:28.341 --> 03:33.013
[Med Hat] Kinike, Himbosha,
Yaloka, Haiupe, and more.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.350
All Nations allied.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.387
That's good to know.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.823
-Old Smoke.
-[grunts]

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
Say hello to our friends.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.728
Dwight Manfredi,
this is Old Smoke.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.298
How you doing?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.234
What did you say your name was?

03:54.302 --> 03:56.570
Dwight Manfredi.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.038
"The-White."

03:58.071 --> 04:01.342
[chuckles]
No.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.377
Dwight with a D.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.912
Uh-huh.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.748
Like I said...

04:07.781 --> 04:09.383
"The-White."

04:09.417 --> 04:11.452
[laughing]

04:11.519 --> 04:12.720
Okay.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.054
Go in peace, brother.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.756
Thanks.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.731
[snorts]

04:23.764 --> 04:25.299
What?

04:25.366 --> 04:27.535
-"The-White," man.
-Don't start.

04:27.568 --> 04:28.536
Yo, Da-White man?

04:28.569 --> 04:29.937
Da-White Manfredi.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.372
-He's like a seer.
-It's crazy,

04:31.405 --> 04:32.573
How you never thought
about that? That's--

04:32.606 --> 04:34.408
I love that shit. Da-White Man.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.409
[laughs]
What's a seer, man?

04:36.444 --> 04:38.946
-What are you talking about?
-Like, medicine man plus.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.648
-[chuckles]
-You know, sees the future.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.250
Come on, enough with the
dream catcher powwow bullshit.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.585

04:44.618 --> 04:46.920
We got to concentrate
on what's important now.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.823
Yeah, like when are we gonna
take out Bevilaqua?

04:50.758 --> 04:52.426
Whoa, what happened
to all the pacifist shit?

04:52.460 --> 04:53.894
Died along with Jimmy.

04:53.927 --> 04:55.463
Jimmy was a good guy, Bodhi.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.430
Jimmy and I were brothers, man,

04:56.464 --> 04:58.466
and he's dead because of me.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.267
Oh, don't even start that shit.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.602
I invited him into this.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.604
Hey, Bodhi, he accepted.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.773
He was a grown man.

05:05.806 --> 05:09.777
Okay. Well, excuse me for having
fucking survivor's guilt.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.279
My conscience is still intact.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.747
I can't afford to have
a conscience right now.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.649
I cannot help the dead.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.318
My job is to keep
the living alive.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.437
What's the tally?
What'd he take?

07:50.470 --> 07:51.972
He got little over a half a mil.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.074
-Goddamn.
-I need you to go over

07:54.107 --> 07:56.176

find out something.

What the fuck? This guy

08:05.519 --> 08:07.487
just whacks him
and gets away with it?

08:07.521 --> 08:10.791
No, that's not gonna happen.
It's not fucking gonna happen.

08:10.824 --> 08:11.992
We got to kill him.

-Bevilaqua, that's who.

We been talking, all of us.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.316
Got a proposition for you.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.184
Maybe a path back.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.788
-What's that?
-Head west,

08:40.821 --> 08:43.155
get Dwight back into the fold.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.826
Didn't you guys already take
care of that at the sit-down?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.195
Dwight don't like me.
You know that.

08:48.261 --> 08:51.632
You, he might listen to.
He's a huge

08:51.665 --> 08:53.734

You cut some kind of a deal,

08:53.801 --> 08:55.502

a long way over here.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.737
Why don't we get rid of him?

08:56.804 --> 08:58.672
Enough of this bullshit already.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.741
I can't tell you what to do.

Maybe-maybe I call a truce.

How's that work?
We just clipped one of his crew.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.500
Well, we got to try and squash
this fucking thing

09:27.534 --> 09:29.402

-Yeah.

In due time, we'll deal
with Thresher, I promise.

And I told that greedy fuck

not to mess with Ming
a long time ago.

to go back to New York.

just leave me alone?

Of course not,
but it's not the same thing.

It is true, seriously.

We're here at this spot
in this time,

Okay. Let's say that's right.
What are you gonna do about it?

You can't go back
and change what was.

No, but I can change what is.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.394
I called Chickie
to reach out to Manfredi.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.830
Vince, too.
I got radio fucking silence.

12:09.863 --> 12:11.698
We're gonna have to take
extra precautions.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.400
What the fuck you call this?

12:13.466 --> 12:16.904
Look, Bill, I...
I don't know what to do.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.039
You know what's funny?

12:19.072 --> 12:20.107
You come find me every time
you're down to your last out.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.875
What did I tell you?

12:21.909 --> 12:23.543
I told you stay away
from the fucking Chinaman.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.912
Yeah, that's a big help now.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.346
Hey, you made this bed.

12:26.379 --> 12:29.049
Okay? Not me.
You're gonna unmake it quick,

12:29.082 --> 12:30.383
or I'm gonna put a bullet
in your fucking head.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.852
Wait a second.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.487
I may have a way
to get to Manfredi.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.025
Just fucking fix it.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.592
-I'll get it done.
-Fix it.

12:39.626 --> 12:40.861
Yeah, go fuck yourself.

I've always wanted

12:49.436 --> 12:51.238
to do something like this.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.140
At least, I thought
I did, but...

12:53.206 --> 12:55.575
-I'm not so sure anymore.
-I totally get it.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.979
I mean, I... I love horses.
And it's not that

12:59.046 --> 13:00.213
-I'm not grateful. I am.
-No.

13:00.247 --> 13:01.781
No, I understand.

13:01.815 --> 13:03.450
Now is the time
you should figure out

13:03.516 --> 13:05.285
what you want to do
with your life.

13:05.318 --> 13:08.488
But you got to be smart,
'cause it goes by really fast.

13:08.555 --> 13:12.092
Thank you for understanding.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.693
No problem.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.432
Excuse me.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.667
[engine stops]

13:24.938 --> 13:26.273
Margaret.

13:27.807 --> 13:30.477
We need to talk. It's important.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.679
Me just being here
is putting my life in jeopardy.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.647
[chuckles] Are you serious?

13:34.681 --> 13:36.716
No, I'm fucking dead serious.
It's Ming.

13:37.684 --> 13:38.886
What about him?

13:40.120 --> 13:43.490
I didn't really tell you,
at least not directly.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.059
He's dangerous.
Much more than I thought.

13:46.093 --> 13:47.094
How?

13:47.127 --> 13:49.262
I've seen him kill people,

13:49.296 --> 13:50.998
and he enjoys it.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.501
Oh. So, you got me in business
with a fucking psychopath.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.103
Wait a second,
I think you are forgetting

13:56.136 --> 13:58.205
that you came to us first,
Margaret.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.309
Anyway, Ming has squeezed me out
and he's threatened my life.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.911
He's dealing in everything now,

14:03.944 --> 14:06.013
from heroin to arms
to human trafficking.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.816
And now he's trying
to take everything with him.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.318
Including my ranch?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.153
Yeah, I'm sorry, Margaret.

14:13.186 --> 14:14.888
-Fuck you.
-Ooh.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.489
What am I supposed
to do about this?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.691
Help me. Manfredi.

14:18.725 --> 14:19.692
What?

14:19.726 --> 14:20.994
Remember Bill Bevilaqua?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.029
Yeah, your ex-partner.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.830
Well, the two of them have been

14:23.863 --> 14:25.332
in this shitty little fight now
for too long.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.367
[scoffs] You really
know how to pick 'em, Cal.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.070
Listen. Manfredi thinks
that Bill tried to kill him.

14:30.137 --> 14:33.040
It wasn't Bill. It was Ming.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.143
What do you want from me?

14:36.176 --> 14:38.745
Convince Manfredi to sit down
and hear us out.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.381
If not, we're all fucked.

Trying to go hit the court?

15:01.568 --> 15:03.036
I could change clothes
real quick.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.204
Oh, shoot, well, I'm still gonna

15:04.237 --> 15:05.805
have to spot you a few points.

15:05.838 --> 15:08.741
-Man, get out of here.
-[laughs]

15:08.775 --> 15:10.110
How you doing? Doing all right?

15:10.177 --> 15:12.412
Well, shit, yeah,
I'm glad to be home.

15:12.445 --> 15:13.981
I'll tell you that, man.

There's only so much
hospital Jell-O a man can eat.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.719
Oh, what? Ooh, I already know.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.122
So, uh...

15:23.090 --> 15:24.424
Where's Ma?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.895
Well, that's actually
why I asked you to stop by.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.464
Angie?

15:46.279 --> 15:49.116
-Tyson.
-Mama.

15:49.182 --> 15:51.518
So, I need to speak
to both of you.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.255
Now, there's, uh...

15:55.288 --> 15:57.457
there's something about
looking death in the face

15:57.490 --> 16:01.128
that puts things
in perspective real quick.

16:03.196 --> 16:07.234
The only thing
that you think about,

16:07.267 --> 16:10.037
worry about, care about
is your family.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.940
I know you're upset
with our son,

16:13.973 --> 16:16.276
and I don't blame you.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.846
I have my own issues with
your choices, as you know.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.151
But I love you both more
than anything in this world.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.921
And there's nothing more
important to me than my family.

16:30.090 --> 16:33.160
So I need you two
to get past this.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.598
I need us to be together again.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.467
Because for me,

16:40.500 --> 16:43.136
losing my family...

16:44.104 --> 16:46.039
...would be worse than death.

You know, Chickie and Bevilaqua
are essentially the same guy.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.162
Everything they got--
[scoffs]

17:09.195 --> 17:11.330
was handed to 'em
by their old man.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.866
Only thing I got handed
was a fucking backhand.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.502
Yeah, but look how good
you turned out.

17:15.535 --> 17:17.537
-True.
-[Bigfoot] Hey, boss?

17:21.907 --> 17:23.276
What are you doing here?

17:24.377 --> 17:26.279

all the time.

17:26.313 --> 17:28.681
I know, but it's not safe.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.551
Yeah, that's what I'm hearing
about my ranch.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.920
What happened?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.191
Can we go sit somewhere
and talk?

17:38.225 --> 17:40.360
Yeah, sure. Come on.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.995
So, what's going on?

17:43.029 --> 17:44.764
[soft chuckle]

17:46.333 --> 17:47.867
Okay.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.572
-About a year ago...
-Mm.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.075
I had a problem with my ex.
You met him.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.345
Yeah, don't remind me.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.447
[chuckles] Yeah.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.550
It was actually
right after that.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.885
He did a little
creative accounting

18:05.918 --> 18:08.388
and tried to buy me
out of the ranch.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.723
I needed cash.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.559
A lot of it.
Quickly.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.294
Why didn't you come to me?

18:14.361 --> 18:17.063
Because I felt stupid and...

18:17.096 --> 18:19.666
and we didn't have
that kind of relationship.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.269
So, anyway,

18:22.302 --> 18:23.770
I had known Cal Thresher

18:23.836 --> 18:26.206
a long time.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.841
And God knows he was rich, so...

18:30.943 --> 18:34.080
He bailed me out.
Took a position in the ranch.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.748
How big a position?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.784
Forty-nine percent.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.086
We'll buy him out.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.054
Not that simple.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.992
He came in with a psychopath
of a partner.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.360
Guy named Ming.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.298
-Ming.
-And according to Cal,

18:51.331 --> 18:54.301
it was Ming who was behind
your car bombing.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.703
You believe that?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.440
I don't know. I don't know.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.409
All I know is he asked me

19:02.442 --> 19:06.179
to intervene on his behalf,

19:06.246 --> 19:08.615
see if you would be willing

19:08.648 --> 19:11.184
to talk to him and Bevilaqua.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.985
Mm-mmm.

19:13.019 --> 19:15.154
I'm way past talking.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.791
I'm asking you
to do this for me.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.461
If you're having trouble,
I'll take care of it.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.796
It's not me I'm worried about.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.498
I'll take care of it.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.134
How?

19:28.167 --> 19:31.371
Revenge to the man

19:31.438 --> 19:34.006
has to be so severe

19:34.040 --> 19:38.545
that his vengeance
need not be feared.

19:41.180 --> 19:44.484
Machiavelli said that, not me.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.818
You want a drink?

Yeah, hi. I'm trying to book
a flight on the website,

19:58.265 --> 20:00.199
but it keeps telling me
it's rejected.

the pleasure of speaking?

Okay, I see that you've been
blocked by the TSA.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.067

20:35.101 --> 20:38.170
Yeah, but that was
a misunderstanding.

20:38.204 --> 20:40.573
I'm sorry, sir,
there's nothing I can do.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.509
Wait, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

20:42.542 --> 20:44.877

We need to put
our differences aside.

Could you guys
just shut the fuck up?

Yes, we have competing agendas

varied interests.
Who gives a shit?

Right now we have
a common enemy.

Dream fucking on.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.343
No?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.479
Okay, then why are you
so desperate

21:52.512 --> 21:54.447
to let everybody know

21:54.481 --> 21:56.583
that you weren't involved
in trying to kill me?

21:56.616 --> 21:58.685
It wasn't me, Dwight.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.487
Or you wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

Ming.

That's called
guilt by association.

with the bombing.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.478

to get rid of everyone

to kill each other--

no reason whatsoever--

22:36.889 --> 22:38.658
Ming is gonna take over.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.528
So, you want

22:41.594 --> 22:43.496
or need my help?

22:43.530 --> 22:46.165
No, we all need each other's
help. That's why you're here.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.174

Sir.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.636
There's somebody here.
They need to talk to you.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.647
I'm very sorry
to just show up like this.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.616
What do you want?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.284
Do you know who I am?

23:38.317 --> 23:41.087
You worked for Thresher.
And Dwight Manfredi.

23:41.120 --> 23:44.123
Not anymore.
Manfredi wants to kill me.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.460
I robbed his casino.
I took half a million dollars.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.762
So, what do you want?

23:49.796 --> 23:52.098
I'll never live to spend it
if Manfredi is alive.

23:52.131 --> 23:53.566
So fucking kill him.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.934
I can't.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.736
Which is it?

23:56.769 --> 24:00.139
You're a thief with a conscience
or a thief with no balls?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.774
I'm not a killer, sir.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.876
Ah.

24:03.910 --> 24:07.647
But you know I am,
which is why you're here.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.082
Manfredi knows it was you
behind the car bombing.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.084
Thresher told him.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.753
And now he's coming for me.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.221
Hard.

24:16.623 --> 24:19.125
Hard?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.693
He's nothing to me.

24:25.598 --> 24:26.666
If you're lying...

24:31.237 --> 24:33.205
...I will kill you.

24:34.507 --> 24:37.476
After I kill your entire family
in front of you first.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.178
I believe you.
I would never test you.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.647
Sir.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.314
How do I get to him?

24:42.348 --> 24:44.150
When is he most vulnerable?

24:44.183 --> 24:46.418
When he's with his girlfriend
at her ranch.

24:48.254 --> 24:50.322
Tell me.
Who's there?

24:50.356 --> 24:51.658
Who protects him?

24:51.691 --> 24:54.393
No one protects him,
no one's there.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.662
Taking them both out
would be simple.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.564
I know every inch of that place.
