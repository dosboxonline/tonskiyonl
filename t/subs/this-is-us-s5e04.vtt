00:13.847 --> 00:16.099
I mean, pending a-a good meeting
with the director,

00:16.182 --> 00:17.767
(laughs):
I-I got the part.

You cannot make me.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.244
I think I got...

00:36.327 --> 00:39.289
maybe two hours of sleep?

00:39.372 --> 00:42.751
What? You got two whole hours?

the one who sleeps for too long.

we just got to let Kevin

I know, I know, I know.

Maybe we just, maybe we just
give it one more night?

01:12.947 --> 01:16.409
Babe, we’ve been saying that for months.

Look, how is Kevin gonna
teach himself to sleep

01:19.954 --> 01:21.915
if every time he cries,
we're just, we're rushing in there

01:21.998 --> 01:24.751

-Rip Van Winkle.

01:24.834 --> 01:28.546
Rip Van Winkle, that's the name
of the guy from the fairy tale

01:28.630 --> 01:30.548
-I couldn't remember.
-Babe?

01:30.632 --> 01:32.258
-What?
-Tonight’s the night.

01:33.301 --> 01:35.428
Tonight we let him cry it out.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.722
Okay?

01:41.184 --> 01:44.771
Okay. Tonight’s the night.

I have to eat 50 eggs a week.

"Nobody can eat 50 eggs."

-You okay, Kev?
-KEVIN: Yeah, I...

02:34.988 --> 02:36.531
woke up early to work out with Dad,

02:36.614 --> 02:38.575
and I was up late memorizing the playbook.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.661
Okay, well, just don’t push it, bud.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.371
When I have to memorize stuff for a test,

02:43.455 --> 02:45.373
I use rainbow flash cards.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.542
The different colors help your brain
retrieve the information.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.002
Ah, that’s really cool.

02:49.085 --> 02:50.545
-It is?
-No, you dork.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.589
It’s totally lame,

JACK:
Kev, don’t knock it, all right?

02:54.507 --> 02:57.218
That is a straight-A system
that Randall’s got right there.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.845
All right, school time.
Let's go, guys.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.221
Finish up.
Get your book bags, okay?

03:00.305 --> 03:01.765
-Let's go.
-REBECCA: Can you grab him...?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.058
Yeah, no, I got it. Kev,

03:03.141 --> 03:04.726
I'm gonna pick you up
after football today.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.353
REBECCA:
Wait. Lunches, Kevin.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.355
Randall, Bug.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.648
Thanks.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.650
-Jack.
-Yeah.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.153
Kevin is totally exhausted.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.404
Of course he’s exhausted.
He’s working hard

03:16.488 --> 03:17.781
at something that he loves.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.033
Babe, it's-it's the best
kind of exhausted.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.162
See you in a bit.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.376
-Kevin.
-KEVIN: Ava.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.086
-Oh, my God, hi.
-Hi.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.755
It's so good to finally
meet you in person. This is great.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.298
I got to tell you,
I’m beyond thrilled to finally

03:35.382 --> 03:37.676
-get to work with you.
-Thank you. Me, too.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.886
You know what?
I'm a little nervous to meet Foster.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.388
I... his last film, right?

03:41.471 --> 03:42.806
I-I thought it was the greatest
thing I'd seen all year.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.307
Me, too. I’m obsessed.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.101
-I’ve seen it at least ten times.
-Right?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.061
I have to ask, are we supposed to call him

03:48.144 --> 03:50.146
Jordan Martin Foster or just Foster?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.314
I have no... I-I’ve heard both.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.357
-Yeah.
-I don't know what he likes.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.192
We'll just feel it out, I guess.

03:54.275 --> 03:57.195
-We'll find out.
-FOSTER: Hey, guys.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.030
-Hey.
-Thank you for doing all the quarantining

03:59.114 --> 04:00.615
and testing.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.076
-Oh, I'll text you when we're done.
-ASSISTANT: Okay, thanks.

04:03.159 --> 04:05.537
-See you later.
-FOSTER: Thank you.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.955
Ava.

04:07.038 --> 04:09.666
-Hi.
-Oh, my God.

04:09.749 --> 04:12.252
I am so glad that you agreed
to do this film.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.839
I told the producer,
I said, "If Ava says no,

04:15.922 --> 04:17.882
"I’m not doing it either,
'cause there would literally

04:17.966 --> 04:19.676
be no point."

04:19.759 --> 04:22.387
AVA:
Oh, my God, ten pages into the script,

04:22.470 --> 04:24.681
I called my agent and I was like,
"I have to do this film.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.016
I have to."

04:26.099 --> 04:29.060
-So, thank you.
-(phone chimes)

04:31.062 --> 04:32.772
Yeah, I just...
I feel the same way.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.315
You know? After your first film,

04:34.399 --> 04:37.402
I thought, you know, any role
this guy wants me to play,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.571
I will do it, let alone
a character like this.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.865
You know, so complex, right?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.908
-Unpredictable in a movie...
-Film.

04:45.160 --> 04:47.662
Uh, it’s a film.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.581
Anyway,

04:49.664 --> 04:51.499
let’s dig into the script, shall we?

04:51.583 --> 04:53.043
Uh, I would like to start

04:53.126 --> 04:54.878
with the two-hander scene
between you guys,

04:54.961 --> 04:58.381
starting on page eight.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.303
-Are you sure?
-I’m sure.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.013
'Cause once we sign these papers...

05:05.096 --> 05:07.932
Babe, it’s a birth plan,
it's not a deal with the devil.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.352
Okay?
Either party can change their mind

05:10.435 --> 05:12.354
-at any time.
-Yeah, don’t remind me.

05:12.437 --> 05:15.398
We are totally at Ellie’s mercy here,

05:15.482 --> 05:17.108
until the baby is born.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.195
Even after the baby is born,
we are at Ellie's mercy.

05:20.278 --> 05:22.238
Until she signs the relinquishment papers,

05:22.322 --> 05:23.907
we are completely at Ellie’s...

05:23.990 --> 05:25.992
-mercy.
-Mercy. I know. I know, Tobe.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.329
Well, Ellie is going
to her ob-gyn appointment today

05:29.412 --> 05:32.332
and only one person can go,
and she asked me to come,

05:32.415 --> 05:35.835
so, I don't know, that’s got
to be a-a good sign, right?

05:35.919 --> 05:39.631
Yes. Yes.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.716
Why do we call it an ob-gyn?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.927
We don’t call a cardiologist a C-A-R-D

05:44.010 --> 05:46.888
or a dermatologist a D-E-R-M.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.517
Okay, uh, will Serious Toby

05:50.600 --> 05:52.644
be watching the ultrasound on FaceTime?

05:52.727 --> 05:56.356
Or will Funny Toby
miss seeing Baby Chloe...

05:56.439 --> 05:58.566
for the first time?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.819
Baby Chloe?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.863
So, have we decided to go with that name?

06:04.906 --> 06:06.825
I think we have.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.912
Serious Toby is very excited.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.081
It’s just hard to tell
because he’s so serious.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.291
Okay.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.546
Mother, can we please
go to the salon today?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.214
-My hair is a fright.
-TESS: A fright?

06:21.297 --> 06:24.259
Mom, I told you not to let her
watch <i>Little Women </i>again.

06:24.342 --> 06:28.013
Okay. Politician’s dilemma:
solid versus striped.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.682
Solid says I stand by my convictions.

06:30.765 --> 06:33.810
Hmm. Striped says I represent
my entire community.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.021
It’s very cute,
you want to look nice for your protégé.

06:36.104 --> 06:39.399
Honey, I prefer to think of him
as my apprentice.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.692
Thank you.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.903
Hey, Dej.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.990
Big day today.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.117
Of all the people that Malik
could have asked to shadow

06:49.200 --> 06:52.537
at work for his school project,
who did he choose?

06:52.620 --> 06:56.374
Hint: his name
rhymes with <i>Gandall Gearson,</i>

06:56.458 --> 06:57.917
and he’s your <i>gather...</i>

06:58.001 --> 07:00.003
It’s a civics assignment,

07:00.086 --> 07:03.173
and you’re the only city
councilman in his COVID pod.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.216
-Who else is he gonna ask?
-Your father and your boyfriend

07:05.300 --> 07:07.594
spending the entire day together.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.846
-(doorbell rings)
-What could go wrong?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.057
You’re enjoying this way too much.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.267
Something is wrong with you.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.186
(laughs)

07:16.269 --> 07:17.979
-BETH: Hey, Malik.
-MALIK: Hey, Mrs. Pearson.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.397
-Nice suit.
-Thank you.

07:19.481 --> 07:21.024
TESS:
Ooh.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.360
8:06.
Thought we said 8:00 sharp.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.571
-Oh. I-I’m sorry, Mr. Pearson. I'm...
-I’m just messing with you, man.

07:26.654 --> 07:28.656
Striped. It's a good call.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.368
And, look, thank you again
for letting me do this.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.869
You know, I’ve lived in Philly
my whole life,

07:32.952 --> 07:34.579
so I am excited to see how the city runs.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.289
Malik, it’s my pleasure.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.709
It's my pleasure.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.004
-DEJA: Okay, a couple things.
-Mm-hmm?

07:43.088 --> 07:46.341
Don’t talk about us, okay?
Don’t talk about me.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.343
Don’t talk about you.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.970
Actually, just don’t talk at all.

07:51.054 --> 07:54.015
And good luck or whatever.

07:54.099 --> 07:55.642
You look good in that suit.

07:55.725 --> 07:59.229
Okay, we are now officially
seven minutes behind schedule.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.523
That is seven minutes of problems
that don’t get solved

08:01.606 --> 08:03.149
because you were late, Malik.
Let’s not make it eight.

08:03.233 --> 08:05.193
Hey, yo, yo, yo.

08:05.276 --> 08:08.154
<i>Gandall Gearson gout.</i>

08:08.238 --> 08:09.489

08:18.832 --> 08:21.793

Kate and Randall are down.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.878
Yeah.
Kevin, too, finally.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.631
He fell asleep in my arms
and then I managed

08:26.715 --> 08:29.676
to slide him into his crib
without waking him up.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.886
-It was a real pro move.
-Such a pro move.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.763
-Yeah.
-Such a pro move.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.181
(Rebecca laughs softly)

08:35.265 --> 08:36.933
(baby crying)

08:37.017 --> 08:39.769
-Oof.
-(groans)

08:39.853 --> 08:41.688
Yeah, I should make sure
that he's in an okay position.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.314
No, babe, babe, babe, come on.

08:43.398 --> 08:46.818
W-We agreed we got to give him
a chance to calm himself down.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.946
-He’ll stop.
-Uh, I...

08:51.031 --> 08:53.033
-(sighs)
-He'll stop.

08:54.826 --> 08:57.203
(whistle blowing in distance)

08:57.287 --> 08:59.205
JACK:
How was practice?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.498
Fine.

09:05.503 --> 09:06.629
STIKES:
Hey, hey.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.465
-Oh, hey, Coach.
-Hey.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.050
-How you doing? It's good to see you.
-Good to see you.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.843
-Yeah.
-Good to see you. Hey, I, wanted to, uh,

09:11.926 --> 09:13.553
I wanted to clear something up.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.681
(chuckles) I didn’t expect the boys
to actually eat 50 eggs.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.850
It’s a line from a movie.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.393
Well, it sounds like what we’ve got here

09:20.477 --> 09:22.312
is a failure to communicate.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.980
Ah.
Clearly a man who knows his movies.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.231
JACK (laughs):
Yeah.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.568
We did have some bumps on the field today.

09:28.651 --> 09:31.863
-Kevin hasn’t got the playbook down.
-Really?

09:31.946 --> 09:36.076
Well, he-he’s been studying real hard.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.119
Well, to be honest, Kev’s probably not

09:38.203 --> 09:39.746
my biggest fan right now, eh, Kevin?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.332
I was riding him pretty hard
out there today.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.334
He’s got something special, no doubt,

09:44.417 --> 09:46.002
but he’s got to be willing
to put in the work.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.879
I have kids with half his talent
running drills

09:47.962 --> 09:50.131
seven days a week.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.342
My son is up for it.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.760
Glad to hear it.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.595
Allegheny College has a weekend QB camp

09:55.679 --> 09:57.931
for seventh and eighth graders
right up in Meadville.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.266
Kev would be a great fit.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.102
But if I’m gonna
recommend him for a spot...

10:02.185 --> 10:05.313
-He's got to put the work in.
-He needs to earn it. Yes, sir.

10:05.397 --> 10:06.981
He will.
Right, Kevin?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.859
-Right.
-STIKES: Thanks, Jack.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.445
-JACK: Yeah.
-I'll see you later, sport.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.620
You got yourself into some trouble.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.914
I didn’t get myself into anything.

10:22.997 --> 10:26.209
Okay. Why'd they call me?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.044
To be honest, I have no idea.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.338
-"To be honest"?
-Yeah.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.759
Here's the thing, when somebody says

10:34.843 --> 10:37.971
"To be honest"
or "If I’m being honest with you"

10:38.054 --> 10:40.098
or "Honestly,"

10:40.181 --> 10:42.225
it usually means
they’re about ready to lie to you.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.935
FOSTER:
Okay, let's, let’s hold there,

10:44.019 --> 10:46.521
for a second.

10:46.604 --> 10:49.149
Ava, excellent.

10:49.232 --> 10:51.568
You are giving him as little as possible,

10:51.651 --> 10:55.655
but you’re giving me
everything that I need.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.742
And... okay.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.036
Let’s just take it back
to the top of the scene.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.164
AVA:
Okay. (clears throat)

11:04.247 --> 11:07.459
Yeah. Sure, okay.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.839
(exhales)
Got yourself into some trouble.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.507
I didn’t get myself into anything.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.092
So why'd they call me?

11:16.176 --> 11:19.721
AVA:
To be honest, I have no idea.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.639
-"To be honest."
-Yeah.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.141
Hang-hang, hang on.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.227
-Kevin.
-Uh-huh?

11:26.311 --> 11:28.188
Just, just take it back a couple lines.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.024
Sure. Sure.

11:38.156 --> 11:39.699
So why'd they call me?

11:39.783 --> 11:42.327
-To be honest, I have no idea.
-"To be honest."

11:42.410 --> 11:43.411
-AVA: Yeah.
-One more time?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.166
(inhales, exhales)

11:48.249 --> 11:50.043
Then why'd they call me?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.462
-AVA: To be honest, I have no idea.
-"To be honest"?

11:52.545 --> 11:54.881
-Can I get that last line again?
-You know, I just... if you want to give me a specific detail...

11:54.964 --> 11:55.882
No, no.
Stay in the scene, please stay...

11:55.965 --> 11:57.008
I’m trying to stay in the scene,

11:57.092 --> 11:59.302
but you keep... interrupting me.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.515
Believe me, Kevin,
I wish I didn’t have to interrupt.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.976
(softly):
Good to... All right.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.773
All right.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.984
Um, just from the same... s... pickup.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.237
Um...

12:17.320 --> 12:20.490
JAE-WON: We’re hearing from a lot
of renters about evictions,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.951
but we’re also getting a lot
of complaints from landlords

12:23.034 --> 12:24.411
-about delinquent rents.
-RANDALL: Yeah.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.413
Let’s finalize the language

12:26.496 --> 12:29.582
on our motion and get it to the council.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.292
All right.

12:34.546 --> 12:35.672
We keeping you up, Malik?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.090
MALIK:
No. Sorry.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.717
JAE-WON: Oh, unfortunately,
I won't be able to shoot

12:38.800 --> 12:40.260
your livestream today.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.387
I’ve got a budget meeting
at the same time.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.057
RANDALL: All right. We livestream
a daily community bulletin.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.269
I cover local news and answer
questions from constituents.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.438
MALIK: Oh, yeah, I know.
That's the one Deja watches every day.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.440
RANDALL:
She watches every day?

12:54.482 --> 12:55.734
MALIK:
I am a dead man

12:55.817 --> 12:57.736
-for telling you that.
-Oh, definitely.

12:57.819 --> 13:00.905
RANDALL: Better call your lawyer
and draw up a will. (laughs)

13:00.989 --> 13:02.991
Hey, Malik.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.410
How would you like to cover
the bulletin today?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.328
-MALIK: Me?
-Yeah.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.081
You’re one of the more capable
young humans I’ve met.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.833
We’ll set you up at a desk outside
and you just have

13:11.916 --> 13:13.877
to make sure the livestream
starts and ends on cue.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.004
-Sound good?
-MALIK: Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.964
-For sure. I’m on it.
-JAE-WON: Thank you, Malik.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.716
Uh, let’s just make sure
to get a camera angle

13:19.799 --> 13:21.843
that doesn't go right up his nose.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.136
RANDALL:
I don’t need to be reminded, Jae-won.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.346
I read all the comments.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.889
JAE-WON:
Never read the comments!

13:29.184 --> 13:31.102
ELLIE: This probably sounds insane,
but did you ever wonder

13:31.186 --> 13:32.937
what the ultrasound jelly tastes like?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.189
<i>Yes.</i>

13:34.272 --> 13:35.523
KATE:
Every time that we’re here.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.691
ELLIE (laughs):
I know.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.526
KATE:
Oh, uh, speaking of eating,

13:38.610 --> 13:39.736
Ellie, do you think you maybe

13:39.819 --> 13:41.654
want to have lunch with me after this?

13:41.738 --> 13:43.865
ELLIE:
Yeah, I’d love to.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.367
KATE:
Okay.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.368
DOCTOR:
Here she is.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.786
Looking great.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.996
Heartbeat is strong.

13:50.080 --> 13:51.539
KATE:
There she is.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.043
There’s Chloe.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.683
-(baby crying)
-Well, it's a good thing

14:09.766 --> 14:12.018
-Randall and Kate are such heavy sleepers, huh?
-(groans)

14:12.102 --> 14:13.895
This-this-this isn’t normal crying, Jack.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.647
He’s never cried like this before.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.440
Maybe something’s wrong.
Maybe he’s hurt.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.359
Miguel and Shelly said he's...

14:19.442 --> 14:21.111
Enough with Miguel and Shelly.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.571
Who made them experts, anyway?
Their kids are train wrecks.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.323
(stifled laugh)

14:25.407 --> 14:27.158
What's so funny?

14:27.242 --> 14:29.285
That’s... that's the sound of our son

14:29.369 --> 14:31.162
being emotionally traumatized for life.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.789
Rebecca, do you remember
this morning when we said,

14:32.872 --> 14:35.083
"Tonight’s the night"?
We held hands and...

14:35.166 --> 14:36.835
Yeah, I-I don’t care
what I said this morning,

14:36.918 --> 14:38.795
because I didn’t know
then that he’d be crying

14:38.878 --> 14:40.588
like a maniac for a half hour.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.383
It’s been six minutes.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.218
-No way.
-Mm-hmm.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.928
-What?
-Look, I know this hurts.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.806
I know it hurts, babe,
but, but don’t you want him

14:49.889 --> 14:52.809
to show that crib who’s boss?

14:52.892 --> 14:55.020
No. I don’t care.

14:55.103 --> 14:57.105
I'm sorry, I have to go in there.

15:01.026 --> 15:04.237
-Hi.
-JACK: Hey.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.530
(door closes)

15:06.614 --> 15:07.991
REBECCA:
Is everything all right?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.242
JACK:
Yeah, just a few bumps

15:09.325 --> 15:10.577
at practice.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.203
But we’ll run some drills after dinner,

15:12.287 --> 15:13.329
I'll find the problems.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.749
I just got home from practice, Dad.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.542
It’s fine, Kev,
you can take the night off.

15:17.625 --> 15:20.420
No, he can’t, okay?
The coach said the other kids...

15:20.503 --> 15:21.880
I don’t care what Coach says.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.256
(TV playing indistinctly)

15:27.010 --> 15:28.428
I’m gonna quit.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.637
-(TV turns off)
-No.

15:29.721 --> 15:30.847
Kev, you’re not gonna quit.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.141
All right?
You’re the quarterback.

15:33.224 --> 15:35.352
You made a commitment to that team.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.646
You don't just quit the second
something starts to feel tough.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.857
Okay?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.615
I'm tired.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.537
-(sighs)
-You should have talked to me

15:54.621 --> 15:56.164
before making a decision like that.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.209
Wh... You seriously want to let him quit?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.835
After h-having one rough day?

16:00.919 --> 16:03.963
He’s clearly miserable, okay?

16:04.047 --> 16:06.174
I'm-I’m gonna go up there
and tell him if he doesn't want

16:06.257 --> 16:07.258
to play anymore, he doesn’t have to.

16:07.342 --> 16:08.718
Rebecca, I’m strongly asking you

16:08.802 --> 16:09.969
not to do that.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.182
You about ready?

16:14.265 --> 16:16.601
I want to squeeze in
a quick jog after this.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.728
-Yeah, it's looking like we're good to go.
-Great.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.231
I will count you down
to start the livestream.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.525
And you just let the bulletin
play until you hear me say...

16:23.608 --> 16:25.485
(low-pitched):
"Thank you for your time, Philadelphia.

16:25.568 --> 16:26.695
We’ll talk again tomorrow."

16:26.778 --> 16:29.155
-Get the hell out of here, man.
-(laughs)

16:29.239 --> 16:31.366
<i>These are trucks that can drive right in</i>

16:31.449 --> 16:33.576
<i>and set up safe, clean testing sites...</i>

16:33.660 --> 16:35.328
Dad's doing his bulletin.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.705
<i>Uh, we're trying different spots</i>
<i>around town,</i>

16:36.788 --> 16:39.207
<i>so check my website for an updated list.</i>

16:40.375 --> 16:42.210
<i>Food banks are starting to see...</i>

16:42.293 --> 16:44.546
-(phone buzzing)
<i>-...bumps in need as the weather changes.</i>

16:44.629 --> 16:47.257
<i>Donations are always appreciated.</i>

16:47.340 --> 16:49.467
<i>But please know</i>
<i>that everyone in this office</i>

16:49.551 --> 16:51.594
<i>is working to make sure</i>
<i>that nobody in our community...</i>

16:51.678 --> 16:53.430
Hey, Mom, I’m still at city hall.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.557
<i>-(baby crying over phone)</i>
<i>-I read every message...</i>

16:55.640 --> 16:58.768
Uh, no, no, she-she was fine this morning.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.770
<i>I know that folks</i>
<i>are struggling right now.</i>

17:01.813 --> 17:04.190
Look, I-I left a...

17:04.274 --> 17:05.900
teething ring in the freezer.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.653
At a time when my birth father

17:08.737 --> 17:11.072
didn’t have a family,

17:11.156 --> 17:13.241
this community was his family.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.662
(sighs)
When I'm having a hard day at work

17:17.746 --> 17:20.957
or get frustrated that things
aren’t moving fast enough,

17:21.041 --> 17:24.544
I remind myself
that I am doing this for him.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.632
I’m doing this for William Hill.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.968
Because you all were his family.

17:32.052 --> 17:35.055
Which means that you’re my family, too.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.433
I'm not gonna cry today.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.519
I know a lot of you
like to take bets on that, so...

17:43.021 --> 17:44.689
Thanks for your time, Philadelphia.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.441
We’ll talk again tomorrow.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.737
(blows raspberry)

17:50.820 --> 17:53.740
All right.
(sniffles)

17:53.823 --> 17:55.825
-Yeah, no, okay. Listen, um...
-RANDALL: Malik, I'm gonna change

17:55.909 --> 17:57.327
-and go for that run.
-If she starts crying again,

17:57.410 --> 17:59.037
just give her some baby Tylenol.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.331
But remember to check the dosage, please.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.541
I know you know.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.837
Uh, Beth?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.298
Hold on, hon,
I’m just in the middle of something.

18:10.382 --> 18:13.009
Uh, o-okay, but Randall’s
taking his clothes off

18:13.093 --> 18:15.428
in front of the whole city
of Philadelphia.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.389
Mom? Dad's getting naked!

18:17.472 --> 18:18.848
What?

18:20.850 --> 18:24.145
Oh, my G...
Tess, call your father.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.776
RANDALL:

18:42.038 --> 18:43.415
He’s not answering.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.000
Of course he can’t see his phone,

18:45.083 --> 18:46.835
he's too busy... dancing.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.420
Mm-mm, girl, that’s not dancing.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.338
I don’t know what that is,
but that is not dancing.

18:50.422 --> 18:51.798
ANNIE:
Mom, I want to watch.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.091
Hey, hey, hey.
Annie, you know what?

18:53.174 --> 18:54.968
There's some things you can’t unsee, baby,

18:55.051 --> 18:56.094
and this is one of them, all right?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.637
All right, all right, bye.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.848
Love you.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.809
(phone buzzes)

19:02.892 --> 19:04.728
Hey, Dej, what's up?

19:09.441 --> 19:10.692

he needed to know that he wasn't alone.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.871
-That's all.
-(sighs)

19:22.954 --> 19:24.956
(baby crying)

19:27.417 --> 19:28.877
(groans)

19:28.960 --> 19:30.503
<i>REBECCA:</i>
<i>He is a child.</i>

19:30.587 --> 19:32.380
He is a child playing a game.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.591
It’s supposed to be fun.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.926
-Here we go.
-Here we go what?

19:37.010 --> 19:39.179
You’ve been doing this to him
his entire life.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.390
The second he starts to complain
about something being too hard,

19:42.474 --> 19:43.892
you let him off the hook.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.644
Excuse me?

19:46.728 --> 19:49.564
Guitar lessons, uh, Boy Scouts.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.983
Oh, I'm sorry,
our-our six-year-old got tired

19:52.067 --> 19:54.986
of tying knots all day,
so I let him bail on Boy Scouts.

19:55.070 --> 19:56.529
Put me in mom jail.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.616
You just, you can be really easy on him.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.911
And it’s made him a little...

20:04.746 --> 20:06.164
What?
It's made him what?

20:06.247 --> 20:07.374
Soft.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.001
It's made him soft.

20:22.514 --> 20:25.225
Hey, nerd, tell me how
your stupid rainbow system works.

20:25.308 --> 20:28.103
Very funny.
But whatever the trick is,

20:28.186 --> 20:29.521
I’m not falling for it.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.315
For real.

20:34.317 --> 20:35.944
(sighs)

20:37.946 --> 20:41.825
I need your help.
I keep messing up the plays.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.077
Please?

20:53.003 --> 20:54.754
Hey, Foster.

20:54.838 --> 20:59.050
Or, uh, Jordan Martin Foster or JMF?

20:59.134 --> 21:00.468
I don't know what-I don't know what you...
(chuckles)

21:00.552 --> 21:01.970
I don't know what you want to be called.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.098
Is that what you waited around to ask me?

21:06.599 --> 21:09.853
No. No. I-I, um...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.688
(chuckles):
Uh, you were pretty rough on me in there.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.565
You know? And I was, I was
just wondering if you had

21:13.648 --> 21:17.277
any specific feedback for me
so that I could, you know...

21:17.360 --> 21:20.321
I want to give you what you want,
in the scene.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.615
I didn't realize you were the kind of guy

21:22.699 --> 21:24.617
that needs an attaboy.

21:24.701 --> 21:28.121
-No, no, it's...
-Look, look, today

21:28.204 --> 21:30.999
I learned that you are a good actor.

21:31.082 --> 21:34.294
And there's nothing wrong
with being a good actor.

21:34.377 --> 21:36.755
And when you die, people will say,

21:36.838 --> 21:40.175
"Oh, yeah, I remember him.
He was good."

21:41.217 --> 21:43.261
Or you could be one of the greats.

21:43.345 --> 21:46.848
Now, here's the good news, Kevin:
you get to decide.

21:46.931 --> 21:50.977
Is today as close as you get
to greatness...

21:51.061 --> 21:53.271
or do you come back tomorrow?

21:57.776 --> 21:59.527
See you tomorrow.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.410
KATE:
Hey.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.829
Hey.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.751
(sighs)

22:14.834 --> 22:18.171
Okay, I'm really, really scared
that I tanked it in there

22:18.254 --> 22:20.048
when I called the baby Chloe.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.509
It was totally insensitive.

22:22.592 --> 22:24.344
You know, I can't even imagine

22:24.427 --> 22:26.346
the thousands of emotions
that you're feeling,

22:26.429 --> 22:29.307
and then I go naming her and...

22:29.391 --> 22:31.810
But, Ellie, are you...

22:31.893 --> 22:34.187
are you having second thoughts?

22:36.231 --> 22:38.858
Look, it... caught me by surprise.

22:38.942 --> 22:41.486
The name.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.863
This is all a lot for me.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.491
Yeah, of course it is.

22:50.704 --> 22:53.498
Kate, I told you that my husband died.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.085
We met in tenth grade.

22:57.168 --> 22:59.713
But it took him a long time to ask me out.
(chuckles)

22:59.796 --> 23:03.550
And even when he did,
it was going... slow.

23:03.633 --> 23:04.884
We barely kissed.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.761
So, one day we go to the beach,

23:06.845 --> 23:10.348
and I decide, you know what,
I'm just gonna take charge.

23:10.432 --> 23:13.768
And I pull my T-shirt off,
and I'm standing there

23:13.852 --> 23:17.772
in my cute bikini top,
and he is just staring at my chest,

23:17.856 --> 23:20.608
like, confused, and he's like,

23:20.692 --> 23:24.154
"Wait, you don't have
a big hairy birthmark on your chest

23:24.237 --> 23:26.031
in the shape of South America?"

23:26.114 --> 23:27.991
What?

23:28.074 --> 23:30.285
All year, his bio lab partner
had been telling him

23:30.368 --> 23:32.412
these crazy stories about me.

23:32.495 --> 23:34.497
And the lab partner--

23:34.581 --> 23:37.083
her name was Chloe Penner.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.294
(whispers):
No.

23:39.377 --> 23:40.795
Yeah.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.715
Yeah.

23:43.798 --> 23:47.177
So look, you...
you deserve to name this baby

23:47.260 --> 23:49.512
whatever you want.

23:49.596 --> 23:53.266
-But does it have to be Chloe?
-(laughs)

24:01.691 --> 24:03.526
One time.

24:04.903 --> 24:07.447
I went out just one time...

24:07.530 --> 24:10.742
two years after Doug died.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.873
A few months ago, I...

24:16.956 --> 24:20.377
decided that I couldn't have this baby,

24:20.460 --> 24:23.672
and I made an appointment
to have an abortion.

24:23.755 --> 24:27.592
And I got as far as
the parking lot at the clinic.

24:28.635 --> 24:31.054
And I know that some people
have very strong feelings

24:31.137 --> 24:33.723
-about...
-I'm not judging you at all.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.936
For me...

24:38.019 --> 24:39.938
that wasn't the right choice.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.231
(softly):
Yeah.

24:41.314 --> 24:44.275
So, am I having second thoughts?

24:45.318 --> 24:47.112
Yeah.

24:47.195 --> 24:49.823
About pretty much my entire life.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.703
Except this.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.330
Except you and Toby.

24:57.414 --> 24:59.791
About that I am sure.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.669
Hundred percent sure, Kate.

25:08.174 --> 25:11.136
MALIK:
Mr. Pearson, I am so...

25:11.219 --> 25:13.805
I am so sorry.

25:13.888 --> 25:15.849
(Randall sighs heavily)

25:18.268 --> 25:19.686
(exhales)

25:22.313 --> 25:24.774
I'm sure at your age...

25:24.858 --> 25:27.110
city hall's a bit boring.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.612
But you asked to shadow me, Malik.

25:31.114 --> 25:34.075
The work we do here is serious.

25:34.159 --> 25:36.911
I expected you to take it seriously.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.706
Not show up late,
yawn your way through it,

25:39.789 --> 25:42.208
and forget to do the most important part

25:42.292 --> 25:44.878
of the one thing I asked you to do.

25:44.961 --> 25:47.756
I know. I-I messed up.

25:47.839 --> 25:49.507
I did.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.802
But...

25:52.886 --> 25:56.473
Mr. Pearson, do you know
what time I had to be up this morning

25:56.556 --> 25:59.184
to get to your place
only six minutes late?

26:02.020 --> 26:04.356
4:30.

26:04.439 --> 26:07.567
I usually get up at 5:00,
so that I can make sure

26:07.650 --> 26:10.195
that I prepare all
of Janelle's meals for the day,

26:10.278 --> 26:12.989
do her laundry, wash all her bottles,

26:13.073 --> 26:15.450
all before she gets up at 6:00.

26:15.533 --> 26:17.744
Today I had to pack a lunch

26:17.827 --> 26:21.873
and iron my shirt, so 4:30.

26:21.956 --> 26:25.168
This stuff is not boring at all.

26:25.251 --> 26:28.088
But I have a daughter.

26:29.631 --> 26:32.384
What she needs...

26:32.467 --> 26:34.803
it always comes first.

26:36.096 --> 26:39.432
Even if that means
making the things that I want for myself

26:39.516 --> 26:41.434
that much harder.

26:48.274 --> 26:52.987
I was 17 when I lost my father.

26:53.071 --> 26:55.615
And I felt like I owed it to my family

26:55.699 --> 26:59.244
to make my dreams smaller.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.288
More practical.

27:03.665 --> 27:05.500
But I was wrong.

27:05.583 --> 27:08.628
Listen to me when I say this.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.797
Do not make your dreams smaller.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.507
Make 'em bigger.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.218
Not in spite of your daughter.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.095
<i>For </i>her.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.641
(exhales)

27:21.725 --> 27:23.101
Uh...

27:23.184 --> 27:26.104
I-I appreciate that, Mr. Pearson.

27:26.187 --> 27:28.148
I don't think the size of my dreams

27:28.231 --> 27:30.150
need to be worried about, though.

27:30.233 --> 27:31.776
I get straight A's.

27:31.860 --> 27:33.778
I'm going to go to an Ivy League college

27:33.862 --> 27:35.321
and major in business.

27:35.405 --> 27:37.032
Then I'm gonna go to culinary school,

27:37.115 --> 27:39.117
so that I can open up the first restaurant

27:39.200 --> 27:41.953
in Philadelphia history
to get three Michelin stars.

27:42.037 --> 27:44.581
Well, damn. Okay.

27:44.664 --> 27:48.543
Seems like your dreams
are of the perfectly appropriate size.

27:50.545 --> 27:53.590
Wh-What I do need, though,

27:53.673 --> 27:57.385
is a killer internship

27:57.469 --> 27:59.763
for these college applications.

27:59.846 --> 28:03.308
I was thinking maybe city hall?

28:04.351 --> 28:06.227
I think that can be arranged.

28:06.311 --> 28:08.104
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:08.188 --> 28:10.482
You-you know Deja's
gonna lose her mind, right?

28:10.565 --> 28:13.109
-Oh, I'm counting on it, bruh.
-(both laugh)

28:16.363 --> 28:20.033
(baby crying)

28:24.245 --> 28:26.623
-No, no, no. Out of my way, Jack.
-(closes door)

28:26.706 --> 28:28.291
-Can't do that.
-(grunts)

28:28.375 --> 28:29.876
What we're doing isn't working.

28:29.959 --> 28:33.296
I can't move from this door,
as much as I want to.

28:33.380 --> 28:34.798
Just...

28:34.881 --> 28:36.675

<i>Well, I had the worst first day</i>

29:17.966 --> 29:19.676
I feel like he put me in a bag

29:19.759 --> 29:21.344
and just beat me with a baseball bat.

29:21.428 --> 29:22.971
Why would he put you in a bag?

29:23.054 --> 29:25.015
Why wouldn't he beat you up
outside of the bag?

29:25.098 --> 29:26.433
<i>No, because when you're in the bag,</i>

29:26.516 --> 29:27.892
you don't know where he's hitting you.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.561
You know, just random spots
all over the body.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.563
So you don't know where
the next blow's gonna land.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.023
Oof.

Um, I don't know, maybe, uh, I...

29:42.657 --> 29:45.035
I've been thinking a lot about Mom,
you know?

29:45.118 --> 29:47.245
She's-she's stuck out there at that cabin.

29:47.328 --> 29:49.706
She's using her phone
to stay connected to the family,

29:49.789 --> 29:51.666
and I just thought...

29:51.750 --> 29:55.920
how nice it would be
to do something really great.

29:56.004 --> 29:58.673
Like take her to the Oscars.

29:58.757 --> 30:00.967
<i>Or, like, to win an Oscar,</i>
<i>and then I could stand up</i>

30:01.051 --> 30:02.552
<i>in front of everyone and just thank her</i>

30:02.635 --> 30:04.012
<i>for everything she did for me.</i>

30:05.055 --> 30:08.266
I'd like to do that while she
can still remember, you know?

30:11.102 --> 30:14.731
First I got to give a performance
that's not so tired.

30:15.774 --> 30:16.775

Hmm?

30:18.234 --> 30:20.695

Kate, come on, I'm too tired for subtext.
Just tell me.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.409
Your big fight with Randall--

30:26.493 --> 30:28.953
I mean, didn't he say
that your acting was tired?

30:29.037 --> 30:31.331
This has nothing to do
with Randall, Kate, all right?

30:31.414 --> 30:32.540
This has...

30:32.624 --> 30:34.834
<i>nothing to do with him.</i>

30:34.918 --> 30:37.545
You know, I had a... conversation with him

30:37.629 --> 30:39.714
on, um, our birthday.

30:40.757 --> 30:43.426
<i>And he said some things</i>

30:43.510 --> 30:46.137
<i>that I just can't stop thinking about.</i>

30:46.221 --> 30:49.307
You know, ab-about what it was like...

30:49.391 --> 30:53.395
as a black kid growing up in our family

30:53.478 --> 30:55.271
<i>with white parents,</i>

<i>-he felt.</i>
-Unseen?

31:01.945 --> 31:04.280
Kate, Mom and Dad
were obsessed with Randall.

31:04.364 --> 31:06.449
All right? All we tried to do
is get five minutes a day with them

31:06.533 --> 31:08.451
when they weren't
paying attention to Randall.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.078
Kev...

31:10.161 --> 31:12.247
we don't even talk to him
about this stuff, though.

31:12.330 --> 31:14.874
You know? And we don’t
talk to him about what it was like

wasn't a walk in the park

31:29.472 --> 31:30.765
to be the only black kid

31:30.849 --> 31:32.726
in that fancy private school he went to.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.561
But let's not sit here and pretend

31:34.644 --> 31:36.438

Thank you.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.680
You gonna give that boy an internship

32:51.763 --> 32:53.014

32:53.098 --> 32:54.224
Look, after what happened today,

32:54.307 --> 32:55.975
that kid will not allow himself

32:56.059 --> 32:57.227
to screw up again.

I was that kid.

Your bulletins usually get 5,000 views.

33:29.801 --> 33:31.219
Well, on the plus side,
