00:07.132 --> 00:08.717

00:15.306 --> 00:17.142
I've been having
some memory issues lately.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.476

00:18.560 --> 00:22.147

mild cognitive impairment.

-Don't you think our amazing little man

00:24.983 --> 00:26.901

00:26.985 --> 00:28.611

00:28.695 --> 00:31.031
a pretty good track record with adoption.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.158
I'm not gonna do that trial, Randall.

00:33.241 --> 00:36.077

to convince her to go to St. Louis?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.756

the best possible chance.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.010

00:52.093 --> 00:54.846
to devote yourself to anyone
other than yourself,

00:54.929 --> 00:57.182

but it'll just be a performance,

00:57.265 --> 00:59.809

was the day that Dad died.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.901

14:11.768 --> 14:13.436
