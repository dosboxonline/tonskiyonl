WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:03.462
We're on in five seconds.

00:03.545 --> 00:06.381
Four, three, two…

00:09.343 --> 00:10.886
Good morning. It's Friday.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.180
Glad you could join us.
I'm your host, Jeff Stelling,

00:13.263 --> 00:15.599
here with Chris Kamara
and George Cartrick.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.685
As we head into
the last weekend of the season,

00:18.769 --> 00:22.272
we have an update on
those rumors of change at West Ham United.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.775
But first, we turn our attention to
the championship

00:24.858 --> 00:28.529
and AFC Richmond, the club of
our former foulmouthed colleague…

00:28.612 --> 00:30.364
Roy Kent.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.866
The headline this morning is
the news that

00:32.950 --> 00:36.328
Ted Lasso left in the middle
of the Tottenham match this season

00:36.411 --> 00:39.456
not due to stomach problems,
but because of a panic attack.

00:40.290 --> 00:42.876
Lasso appears to be leaving?

00:42.960 --> 00:43.961
George?

00:44.044 --> 00:46.338
Lasso's clearly not fit to coach.

00:46.421 --> 00:47.923
Come on now, George.

00:48.006 --> 00:50.175
-Be compassionate.
-Come on. Come on, Jeff. Come on.

00:50.259 --> 00:53.637
Would Bill Shankly have
a panic attack, eh? Would Brian Clough?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.890
-Would Alex Ferguson have a panic attack?
-Be fair.

00:56.974 --> 01:00.477
No, of course he wouldn't. Look,
if your ship's being attacked, right?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.104
And you run to the bridge,

01:02.187 --> 01:04.772
you want to find
a captain whose brain works,

01:04.857 --> 01:06.525
not some big girl's blouse.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.153
I miss Roy.

01:33.343 --> 01:37.598
Hi, Ted.
Remember, the truth will set you free,

01:38.307 --> 01:40.517
but first it'll piss you off.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.188
I'm here if you want to talk.
Good luck this weekend.

03:08.730 --> 03:10.274
Hey, fellas.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.069
-Yeah.
-Good one.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.073
Morning, Susan.

03:18.657 --> 03:19.741
Are you all right, Ted?

03:19.825 --> 03:21.034
Yes, ma'am.

03:21.118 --> 03:22.619
Are you sure about that?

03:44.641 --> 03:45.726
Hey, Coach.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.984
Thank you.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.032
Hey, wanker.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.492
If my father had a panic attack
at Normandy,

04:02.576 --> 04:03.994
we'd all be speaking German.

04:06.788 --> 04:07.831
Yes, sir.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.336
Just do the work, pal.
You'll be all right.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.097
I assume you know
what that was all about, yeah?

04:24.640 --> 04:25.641
Nope.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.878
Those are lovely.
Who are they from?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.713
Edwin Akufo.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.007
"Sorry for your loss."

04:59.091 --> 05:00.884
That was thoughtful of him.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.719
He must've heard about
your father's passing.

05:02.803 --> 05:07.558
I've not finished. "But we will give Sam
a very good home in Casablanca."

05:08.809 --> 05:09.935
Still, nice gesture.

05:10.811 --> 05:16.441
So, Leslie, any rumblings
about which way Sam's leaning?

05:16.525 --> 05:19.528
Not a peep,
and I'm trying to play it chill.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.490
So whenever I see him in a hallway,
I just give him a cool nod.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.950
You know, like this.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.870
Oh, shit. That was cool.

05:27.953 --> 05:30.038
I know, right?
I saw it in a Denzel Washington movie,

05:30.122 --> 05:32.291
and I thought, "I'm taking that."

05:33.250 --> 05:35.210
Still, it's not looking great.

05:37.254 --> 05:39.464
Hey. What's the story, Paul Shorey?

05:39.548 --> 05:40.841
Ted.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.426
So sorry about the article, Ted.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.011
Oh, that's okay, Keeley.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.889
You know what they say.
No such thing as bad publicity, right?

05:47.472 --> 05:49.516
Although, I think they might've been
wrong about that one,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.352
which is a bummer 'cause they were spot on
with the beer before liquor thing.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.521
-Here you go, boss.
-Thank you, Ted.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.523
And you know that
you have our full support.

05:56.607 --> 05:57.691
I appreciate that.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.276
I still wish I could've done something

05:59.359 --> 06:01.612
before that dick Trent Crimm
posted the article.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.114
Oh, no, come on. Trent's a good guy.
He's just doing the gig.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.909
Well, don't worry. I'm gonna speak
directly to the owner of the paper

06:06.992 --> 06:09.036
and see who this anonymous source was.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.623
Nah, come on, no need.
Fact is, everything they said was true.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.584
And unlike Lieutenant Kaffee,
I actually can handle the truth.

06:16.585 --> 06:20.255
Well then, my advice is
no press until after the match.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.174
I agree.

06:22.257 --> 06:25.385
Concentrate on the task in hand,
beating Brentford.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.222
Yes, because if we lose, it will kill me.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.224
Please don't lose, Ted. I beg you.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.559
Hey, don't you worry, Hig Newton.
I'm on it like a bonnet.

06:32.643 --> 06:35.020
Oh, God. These taste like shit.

06:35.103 --> 06:38.690
Oh, yeah. Well, it was a rough night,
and I am now absolutely positive that

06:38.774 --> 06:40.567
I switched the salt and sugar.
I'm sorry about that.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.278
No, no, no.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.864
No, it's interesting.

06:48.575 --> 06:50.994
She's a sneaky, salty bitch.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.705
Like Heather Locklear
on Melrose Place, right?

06:53.789 --> 06:55.499
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.416
Right?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.502
-That's exactly how you'd describe her.
-Yeah.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.586
Oh, Heather.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.671
Hello.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.798
-I will not be safe out there.
-Hey.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.209
All right?

07:40.169 --> 07:41.879
Is Roy here?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.797
I don't hear any grunting.

07:51.555 --> 07:53.682
-Hey, morning.
-Morning, Nate.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.767
Is Roy here?

07:55.851 --> 07:57.019
No.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.229
You seen this?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.401
Yes. It's awful.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.821
-Yeah.
-Yeah. It was awful.

08:10.741 --> 08:11.742
Yeah.

08:13.660 --> 08:14.620
Roy--

08:14.703 --> 08:15.913
Jamie's looking for you.

08:15.996 --> 08:16.997
Oh, is he?

08:18.207 --> 08:19.208
Oi!

08:20.542 --> 08:21.752
Tartt!

08:21.835 --> 08:22.836
Me?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.467
Through there? Yeah.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.687
Wait.
Can I just say something first?

08:41.395 --> 08:42.731
Yeah, okay. That's a good idea

08:42.813 --> 08:44.691
'cause when I'm done,
you won't have any teeth left,

08:44.775 --> 08:46.360
and you'll need them for the talking bit.

08:47.444 --> 08:51.281
Right. Yeah, okay.

08:52.407 --> 08:56.662
So, at Rebecca's dad's funeral,
I told Keeley that I still loved her.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.413
It was wrong,
and I shouldn't have done it,

08:58.497 --> 09:02.084
but I ain't used to being around
dead people.

09:03.377 --> 09:07.798
It just-- It did something to me,
emotionally, you know?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.926
But I still-- I shouldn't have done it,
and it was wrong,

09:11.009 --> 09:13.595
but I just need you to know that
I respect you,

09:13.679 --> 09:16.223
and I respect Keeley,
and I respect your relationship,

09:16.306 --> 09:19.393
and I will never ever do
anything like that ever again.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.608
Fuck!

09:36.243 --> 09:38.829
Sorry. I kind of froze
when you two came in here,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.873
and I just didn't know what to do.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.126
All right.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.797
Yeah, no, it definitely sounds
both helpful and compassionate.

09:48.881 --> 09:50.215
But I don't think that

09:50.299 --> 09:53.719
you moderating a session between
Coach Lasso and a celebrity psychiatrist

09:53.802 --> 09:55.220
is the best move right now.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.890
All his attention is on Brentford.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.099
Thank you very much.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.186
Fuck you, Piers Morgan.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.107
Holy fucking shit!

10:07.191 --> 10:08.567
Oh, my…

10:12.738 --> 10:13.739
Circle up!

10:15.240 --> 10:16.366
Thank you, Coach.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.618
Hey, fellas.

10:17.701 --> 10:20.495
Before we get started here,
I wanted to talk to y'all about

10:20.579 --> 10:22.414
the article you saw
in the paper this morning.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.666
Actually, y'all probably saw it
on your phones.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.251
I still get the paper, 'cause, well,

10:26.335 --> 10:27.961
you can't cut cartoons
out of a phone, right?

10:28.045 --> 10:29.755
Yeah, but you can screenshot them
and text them.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.423
That's copyright infringement, bruv.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.008
I hear you, Zoreaux,

10:33.091 --> 10:35.344
but you can't hang a screenshot
on a fridge either.

10:35.427 --> 10:37.346
My refrigerator has a television.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.640
I think I have the same one.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.642
-I bought it--
-The point is,

10:41.725 --> 10:43.769
y'all found out about something
from somewhere,

10:43.852 --> 10:45.771
when you should've found out about it
from me first.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.025
But I chose not to tell y'all,
and that was dumb.

10:51.276 --> 10:54.488
You know, fellas, we make a lot of choices
in our lives every single day,

10:54.571 --> 10:58.242
ranging from, "Am I really about to eat
something called Greek yogurt?"

10:59.368 --> 11:02.538
To, "Should I leave my family
and take a job halfway around the world?"

11:04.748 --> 11:08.126
Me choosing not to be forthright
with y'all, that was a bad choice.

11:08.836 --> 11:11.547
But I can't be wasting time
wishing for a do-over on all that.

11:12.297 --> 11:16.093
'Cause that ain't how choices work.
No, sir. No.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.555
That choice,
and my Chicago Bulls Starter jacket

11:19.638 --> 11:21.807
that I let Janelle Rhodes borrow
my sophomore year 'cause

11:21.890 --> 11:24.685
she spilled ketchup all over herself,
and it looked like she'd been shot,

11:24.768 --> 11:26.395
those are two things I ain't getting back.

11:27.563 --> 11:29.898
'Cause every choice is a chance, fellas.

11:31.233 --> 11:34.152
And I didn't give myself the chance
to build further trust with y'all.

11:34.945 --> 11:38.657
To quote the great UCLA college
basketball coach, John Obi-Wan Gandalf,

11:39.658 --> 11:43.161
"It is our choices, gentlemen,
that show what we truly are,

11:43.245 --> 11:44.454
far more than our abilities."

11:46.081 --> 11:48.083
Now, I hope y'all can forgive me
for what I've done.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.169
'Cause I sure as heck wouldn't want

11:50.252 --> 11:51.879
any of y'all to hold anything back
with me.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.006
-Nah, we got you, Coach. We got you.
-We got you, Coach.

11:55.299 --> 11:56.300
Yeah, no problem, gaffer.

11:56.884 --> 11:58.385
And when we sniff out the rat,

11:58.468 --> 12:01.096
permission to take socks full of soap
to their stomach and chest?

12:01.180 --> 12:02.806
We're gonna find 'em and fuck 'em up!

12:02.890 --> 12:04.600
-Yeah!
-We'll kill him!

12:05.809 --> 12:07.019
Follow the money!

12:07.686 --> 12:10.063
No, fellas, look. I'm gonna
nip that talk in the butt right now.

12:10.147 --> 12:11.523
It's "bud" not "butt," Coach.

12:11.607 --> 12:14.067
It is? 'Cause of flowers, right?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.152
Horticulture, baby!

12:15.235 --> 12:17.237
That makes more sense.
I appreciate that. Thank you.

12:17.321 --> 12:20.574
No, look, gentlemen. I want us to focus on
something a little bit more productive,

12:20.657 --> 12:22.326
like working on
Nate the Great's false nine.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.536
-How's that sound? Okay, good.
-Yes. Yeah.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.747
Okay, anybody got any questions
before we get started?

12:27.539 --> 12:29.333
-Yeah, I got one.
-Yeah, Jamie, what do you got?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.710
What are we gonna do
with that fucking thing there?

12:36.340 --> 12:37.716
Yeah, that's a good point. Okay.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.885
Well, tell you what,
let's all head to the north field,

12:39.968 --> 12:42.846
and if you guys hustle, that'll count as
our cardio for today, yeah?

12:42.930 --> 12:45.641
Scram! Whistle! Whistle!

12:50.479 --> 12:51.480
Come in.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.902
What's this?

12:56.985 --> 13:00.572
This is Mascot Idol: Semifinals.

13:00.656 --> 13:04.034
One of these two contestants will be
our new mascot.

13:04.743 --> 13:09.748
Will it be Macy Greyhound
or Tina Feyhound?

13:11.041 --> 13:12.626
Are they all from Barkingham Palace?

13:12.709 --> 13:13.627
Yep.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.504
Miss Campbell here runs the shelter.

13:15.587 --> 13:19.258
London's premier all-female dog breeder.
Suzi Campbell. Nice to meet you.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.300
Nice to meet you.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.677
Huge fan.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.178
Oh, thanks.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.764
Huge fan.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.684
Thank you.

13:31.520 --> 13:32.646
Is now a bad time?

13:33.397 --> 13:35.607
No. Could you give us a minute, please?

13:35.691 --> 13:36.900
Sure.

13:38.819 --> 13:39.987
Wow.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.407
Nice to meet you.

13:45.951 --> 13:46.952
Something wrong?

13:47.995 --> 13:52.124
Actually, something is incredibly right.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.544
The money people that back Bantr,

13:55.627 --> 13:58.797
they wanna finance me opening
my own PR firm.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.425
Oh, my God!

14:01.508 --> 14:02.593
I know, right?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.095
I need some advice.

14:06.180 --> 14:09.558
I'm flattered that you came to me
instead of Ted or Roy.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.767
They're at training.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.311
Well, instead of Rebecca then.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.229
She's the one I'm afraid of telling.

14:14.313 --> 14:15.814
I'm happy to be on the list.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.024
I'm scared.

14:17.608 --> 14:20.402
Well, look. That is perfectly natural.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.824
It can be terrifying becoming a boss.

14:26.325 --> 14:29.661
No. I'm scared of telling
Rebecca I'm leaving.

14:29.745 --> 14:32.497
Oh, right. Because she's so intimidating.

14:32.581 --> 14:35.334
No. She's one of my best friends.

14:35.417 --> 14:39.379
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes.
And you leaving would be

14:39.463 --> 14:43.425
a betrayal on a level
usually reserved for Greek mythology.

14:43.509 --> 14:44.801
No.

14:46.053 --> 14:49.848
I just-- I don't want to appear
like I'm not grateful

14:49.932 --> 14:52.351
for the amazing opportunity
she's given me here.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.981
Keeley, a good mentor
hopes you will move on.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.527
A great mentor knows you will.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.903
I like that.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.196
Yeah? Just made it up.

15:04.279 --> 15:05.280
Wow.

15:06.698 --> 15:09.785
I told Edwin Akufo I would give him
my answer after the match on Sunday.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.703
Does this mean
you've made a decision?

15:12.871 --> 15:14.248
I think so.

15:15.374 --> 15:16.375
Yes?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.544
I don't know.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.546
I'd be crazy not to go, right?

15:20.629 --> 15:23.423
Samuel, you're overthinking this. Relax.

15:23.507 --> 15:26.468
Stop looking for the answer
and let the answer come to you.

15:26.552 --> 15:29.805
If you open yourself to it,
the universe will give you a sign.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.723
Daddy, with all due respect,

15:31.807 --> 15:34.434
isn't this decision too important
to be left to the universe?

15:34.518 --> 15:37.646
The universe
has always put me on the right path.

15:37.729 --> 15:41.984
The universe told me to marry your mother
and to buy Bitcoin in 2009.

15:42.067 --> 15:43.777
2009!

15:46.488 --> 15:49.658
Okay, Dad. I'll keep an eye out
for any messages from the universe.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.287
-I love you.
-I love you.

16:23.108 --> 16:28.030
This morning, Jamie apologized to me
for what he said to you at the funeral.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.240
I didn't say anything.

16:30.324 --> 16:33.327
I know. He said he did it on his own.

16:33.410 --> 16:34.828
What did you do?

16:34.912 --> 16:36.288
What do you think I did?

16:36.371 --> 16:38.123
Punched him.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.250
-Headbutted him.
-Keep going.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.085
Did you murder him?

16:42.169 --> 16:45.088
No. Worse. I fucking forgave him.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.382
It's disgusting, innit?

16:47.466 --> 16:50.802
No. I'm really proud of you.

16:51.345 --> 16:52.554
I fully support that.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.183
Wait. I've got some news too.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.144
For fuck's sake. Don't tell me Ted
tried to get off with you and all.

16:59.978 --> 17:02.940
The VC that back Bantr,

17:03.023 --> 17:08.569
they want to finance me
opening my own PR firm.

17:08.654 --> 17:12.031
Holy fucking shit. That is huge.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.578
You are a fucking CEO and shit.
That's amazing.

17:16.662 --> 17:18.372
I know.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.958
I love you so much.

17:27.256 --> 17:29.883
Look at you. The boss.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.554
Not gonna have time for me anymore.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.222
Shut your pretty mouth.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.478
Just need a second. It's Jane.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.897
How's all that going?

17:44.481 --> 17:45.732
We broke up.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.360
We're back on.

17:50.445 --> 17:51.530
Here you go, boys.

17:51.613 --> 17:52.614
Thanks, Mae.

17:52.698 --> 17:53.699
Thanks, Mae.

17:58.829 --> 18:00.998
Don't worry about it, Ted.

18:02.541 --> 18:06.253
It'll all wash out in a cycle.
It always does.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.172
Thank you, Mae.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.803
I was finished anyway.

18:17.681 --> 18:18.849
We're opening the champagne.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.894
What? No, I thought we were saving that
for something really, really special.

18:21.977 --> 18:25.731
Well, we didn't open it
when your mum moved back up north.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.860
We didn't open it when England
got zero points in the Eurovision.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.946
And we didn't open it when the neighbor
ran over their own snake.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.282
That was nasty.

18:35.365 --> 18:39.161
So we are drinking it tonight. Duck.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.041
Yay.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.089
Shit!

18:51.173 --> 18:54.468
Lizzy just sent over
a preview of the Vanity Fair article.

18:54.551 --> 18:58.722
Oh, shit. They better not have used
any pictures of me smiling.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.432
Like that exists.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.019
Wow.

19:08.315 --> 19:09.650
Oh, no.

19:09.733 --> 19:12.361
They didn't use any of the pictures
with you in them.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.658
Shit, I'm so sorry, Roy.
That is not cool.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.993
-I'm gonna reach out and change that.
-Don't you dare.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.663
Don't you change a fucking thing.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.250
You look powerful.
You're fucking gorgeous.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.417
You look like a BILF.

19:28.252 --> 19:30.796
Oh, yeah? Go on, show me, then.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.140
So…

19:43.517 --> 19:44.601
Are you gonna say anything?

19:45.811 --> 19:47.104
Well, I mean, eventually, yeah.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.690
You may have noticed through the years
I can be quite loquacious.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.066
No. To Nate.

19:52.442 --> 19:53.652
The anonymous source.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.947
Wow. What makes you think it was Nate?

19:59.408 --> 20:00.534
Yeah.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.618
Well, you know my philosophy

20:01.702 --> 20:03.912
when it comes to cats,
babies and apologies, Coach.

20:04.663 --> 20:06.206
You gotta let 'em come to you.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.833
That's not gonna happen.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.210
Some people need a little push.

20:10.294 --> 20:12.296
Yeah. Well, I ain't pushing nobody.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.797
I think it'll help.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.257
Nate will be fine.

20:15.340 --> 20:16.884
No. It'll help you.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.179
Coach,
you keep trying to hold all this in,

20:20.262 --> 20:22.389
I'm afraid your mustache is gonna pop off.

20:26.602 --> 20:28.395
Then I'll look like that fella
from The Hangover.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.022
Bradley Cooper.

20:31.690 --> 20:32.816
You're too good to me.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.739
And I like your mustache.

20:42.784 --> 20:43.827
Hi, babe.

20:43.911 --> 20:45.370
Hi.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.622
Have you got a second?

20:46.705 --> 20:48.081
Of course.

20:48.165 --> 20:49.499
I'm so sorry.

20:49.583 --> 20:50.959
No, don't be.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.004
It's good.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.841
You helped this panda
become a lion.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.302
I'm so proud of you.

21:02.471 --> 21:04.223
Thank you.

21:08.769 --> 21:10.395
Holy fucking shit.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.605
Oh, no. Now what?

21:12.272 --> 21:14.942
Rupert's just bought West Ham United.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.193
No.

21:18.403 --> 21:20.906
And to think for a second, I thought
him giving me his shares in the club

21:20.989 --> 21:22.199
was a kind gesture.

21:25.244 --> 21:26.954
You know, I'm actually
quite reassured to find out

21:27.037 --> 21:30.624
that he is still
just a selfish conniving cock.

21:30.707 --> 21:35.087
Yeah. It does return a certain balance
to the universe, doesn't it?

21:36.964 --> 21:39.883
Promise me
you will not go and work for him.

21:41.260 --> 21:42.803
He can't afford me.

21:44.221 --> 21:46.723
Richmond is my football club.
You know that.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.144
Well, that's if we get promoted.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.813
You might not want to work with us.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.148
That's fair.

21:57.776 --> 22:00.821
A bit of advice for being a boss.

22:02.656 --> 22:04.658
Hire your best friend.

22:07.953 --> 22:09.413
Fuck you.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.042
Now I'm crying again.

22:20.465 --> 22:21.925
Anyone want a ticket?

22:22.718 --> 22:24.720
-All right, Mae?
-Oi, oi, Mae!

22:33.687 --> 22:35.856
-Come on, Richmond!
-Come on, Richmond!

22:35.939 --> 22:37.191
Come on, Richmond!

22:38.567 --> 22:40.360
You get out there and you beat 'em.

22:40.444 --> 22:41.695
We'll smash it, right?

22:41.778 --> 22:43.822
You get them. Fuck 'em.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.157
Go, Coach.

22:52.956 --> 22:53.999
Good afternoon.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.835
-Good afternoon.
-Afternoon.

23:17.397 --> 23:21.193
All right. Y'all good to go on running
Nate's false nine today, yeah?

23:21.276 --> 23:23.028
Well, you'd be fools not to.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.532
All right.

23:26.615 --> 23:27.950
Yeah, we ought to give it a shot.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.368
Why change it now?

23:29.451 --> 23:30.702
I agree.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.248
Did you
get kicked out of your office again?

23:34.331 --> 23:37.251
No, no. Temporary relocation
while they change the carpet in there.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.711
It was absolutely covered in dog shit.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.880
Oh, yeah. No, been there, done that.

23:41.964 --> 23:44.883
Okay. Well, anybody else
got anything they wanna talk about

23:44.967 --> 23:45.968
before we head out there?

23:46.051 --> 23:47.052
Yeah.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.137
I could…

23:50.889 --> 23:53.267
use some…

23:55.060 --> 23:56.687
advice.

23:59.189 --> 24:00.649
Hold on.

24:00.732 --> 24:03.861
Roy, are you saying
you wanna become a Diamond Dog?

24:03.944 --> 24:06.655
Fuck no. I'm just saying I wouldn't mind

24:07.281 --> 24:08.532
being in the room

24:08.615 --> 24:13.036
whilst it fucking happens.

24:13.787 --> 24:16.665
Yeah. Okay. Well,
how about a one-time visitor's pass

24:16.748 --> 24:18.166
for our junkyard dog here, yeah?

24:21.712 --> 24:23.172
Diamond Dogs, mount up!

24:25.465 --> 24:26.592
Yeah. I gotcha.

24:26.675 --> 24:28.760
-Yeah. I'm just gonna stay put.
-Okay. Good idea. Yeah.

24:28.844 --> 24:31.555
You live, you learn, right?
Thank you, Alanis.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.390
All right. Roy.

24:34.808 --> 24:35.809
Bark away.

24:35.893 --> 24:38.896
Remember I told you I had to do
that photo shoot thing with Keeley?

24:38.979 --> 24:40.814
-Yeah, we got it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.983
I know I said
I fucking hate doing those things,

24:43.066 --> 24:44.693
and I do fucking hate doing those things.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.487
But in the end,

24:48.906 --> 24:51.200
they didn't use a single picture
with me in it.

24:51.992 --> 24:55.495
And it hurt my…

24:56.538 --> 24:57.539
feeling.

24:59.917 --> 25:01.001
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.795
In year five,
I was not allowed in the class photo

25:03.879 --> 25:06.632
because I developed a rare smile allergy.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.178
Not the same situation.

25:11.261 --> 25:12.846
The thing is…

25:14.890 --> 25:16.850
she looked so fucking great.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.311
On her own.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.104
Without me.

25:23.398 --> 25:26.652
So natural.

25:29.238 --> 25:30.405
I--

25:30.948 --> 25:33.700
It would've actually been
fucking weird if I was in the pictures.

25:36.745 --> 25:39.414
And then at Rebecca's dad's funeral,

25:39.498 --> 25:42.709
Jamie fucking Tartt tells her
he's fucking in love with her.

25:44.253 --> 25:45.629
And he's still alive?

25:45.712 --> 25:48.257
Yeah. Instead of beating him to death,
I fucking forgave him.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.175
I'm still fucking furious about it.

25:50.259 --> 25:54.721
Okay. Well, Roy,
we appreciate you barking at us.

25:58.058 --> 26:00.519
There's something
I have to confess as well.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.067
Go ahead, Nate-dawg.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.610
Roy,

26:08.694 --> 26:14.241
when Keeley and I went shopping
the other day, I kissed her.

26:17.995 --> 26:20.622
Yeah. She told me about it.

26:20.706 --> 26:21.915
It's okay.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.876
I kissed her.
I kissed your girlfriend.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.502
We're good.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.629
All Jamie did was talk to her,
and you wanted to kill him.

26:27.713 --> 26:29.506
Don't you at least
wanna headbutt me or something?

26:29.590 --> 26:32.676
You made a mistake, Nate.
Don't worry about it.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.053
No, no, I deserve to be headbutted.

26:35.137 --> 26:37.097
I'd be happy to headbutt you, Nate.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.474
Okay, you know what?
I think that's enough right now.

26:39.558 --> 26:41.393
We got work to do, yeah?
Diamond Dogs dismount?

26:46.773 --> 26:49.276
Wait. So sometimes
the fucking Diamond Dogs

26:49.359 --> 26:50.944
is just chatting about shit,

26:51.028 --> 26:53.530
and no one has to fucking solve anything
and nothing fucking changes?

26:54.364 --> 26:55.407
Sometimes. Yeah.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.034
That's cool.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.703
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Oh, my God.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.788
Yes, yes, yes!

27:01.872 --> 27:04.499
It's the 83rd clash
between these two teams

27:04.583 --> 27:06.210
and there's never been more at stake.

27:06.293 --> 27:07.711
Brentford with the lead but Richmond

27:07.794 --> 27:11.006
are still in their unusual
false nine formation.

27:11.089 --> 27:14.801
I don't like it, Arlo. The last match
of the season for promotion.

27:14.885 --> 27:17.346
It's a funny time to be pulling out
a new strategy.

27:21.308 --> 27:24.228
Richmond trying to even it up
before the half,

27:24.311 --> 27:27.773
but they give away possession,
and Brentford have numbers.

27:32.611 --> 27:33.820
Yeah!

27:33.904 --> 27:36.323
-Fuck!
-And that's 2-nil to Brentford.

27:36.406 --> 27:39.368
You try new tactics this late
with this much at stake

27:39.451 --> 27:40.786
and everyone loses their heads.

27:40.869 --> 27:44.248
Stay back! How many times
do I have to fucking tell ya? Stay back.

27:44.331 --> 27:45.582
It's all right.

27:45.666 --> 27:47.125
Hey. We're all right!

27:47.209 --> 27:49.044
It's okay! Come on now!

27:49.962 --> 27:51.129
And it's halftime

27:51.213 --> 27:54.883
of what has been a pulsating
West London derby.

27:54.967 --> 27:57.219
Brentford lead 2-nil,

27:57.302 --> 27:59.513
and Richmond are letting
a golden opportunity

27:59.596 --> 28:01.515
slip through their fingers.

28:07.855 --> 28:11.024
I'ma shoot y'all straight.
This is bleak, yeah?

28:11.567 --> 28:12.776
I mean, look at it out there.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.779
Looks like a Renaissance painting
portraying masculine melancholy.

28:22.661 --> 28:25.372
Okay, so now what?
What we gonna do?

28:25.455 --> 28:27.332
We should abandon the false nine.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.835
It'd work if we had players
who knew what the fuck they were doing.

28:31.253 --> 28:34.131
Yeah, I don't agree, Nate. You know,
I think we gotta stick with it, man.

28:34.214 --> 28:37.467
You know, they just had 45 minutes
to figure out what not to do. Yeah?

28:37.551 --> 28:38.552
What do you think, Roy?

28:38.635 --> 28:40.137
You should ask them.

28:40.220 --> 28:42.306
They're the ones out there
actually doing this shit.

28:49.271 --> 28:50.272
Yeah, all right.

28:53.942 --> 28:55.444
All right, fellas.

28:55.527 --> 28:58.488
Coaches and I are having a little debate
and wanna get y'all's take on it.

28:59.198 --> 29:01.533
Should we stick with the false nine
or switch it up?

29:14.546 --> 29:18.675
The tactic is sound, and we're all
perfectly capable of executing it.

29:21.845 --> 29:23.222
It will work.

29:28.519 --> 29:31.188
Hey, if Jan Maas says it,
you know it's the truth, right?

29:31.271 --> 29:32.523
I wouldn't lie to you.

29:33.857 --> 29:37.027
For instance, Zoreaux,
you should have saved that first goal.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.362
Bro.

29:42.241 --> 29:44.743
Okay. It's been decided.
We're gonna stick with Nate's false nine.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.246
-Now, come on. Bring it in. Let's go.
-Here we go, Greyhounds!

29:54.211 --> 29:55.295
Hey, Captain?

29:57.172 --> 29:58.465
You gonna join us?

30:35.836 --> 30:38.589
Richmond on three.
One, two, three…

30:38.672 --> 30:40.591
Richmond!

30:46.471 --> 30:48.015
Here we go, Richmond!

31:03.197 --> 31:04.198
Hey, Nate.

31:05.365 --> 31:06.366
Hey.

31:07.576 --> 31:08.994
Everything okay?

31:10.704 --> 31:13.540
Yes, Ted. Everything is okay.

31:18.003 --> 31:20.214
What is it? What'd I do?

31:21.173 --> 31:22.257
What are you talking about?

31:22.341 --> 31:24.968
Oh, come on, man. You're mad as hell
at me. I just wanna know why.

31:25.802 --> 31:27.513
Huh? What have I got to learn here?

31:29.556 --> 31:31.850
-You wanna know what you did?
-Yeah, please.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.604
Okay. I'll tell you what you did.

31:39.650 --> 31:43.529
You made me feel like I was the most
important person in the whole world.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.783
And then, you abandoned me.

31:49.868 --> 31:51.954
Like you switched out a light,
just like that.

31:53.121 --> 31:57.709
And I worked my ass off,
trying to get your attention back.

31:57.793 --> 31:59.336
To prove myself to you.

32:01.046 --> 32:02.673
To make you like me again.

32:03.966 --> 32:06.051
But the more I did, the less you cared.

32:06.134 --> 32:07.636
It was like I was fucking invisible.

32:09.471 --> 32:12.266
You haven't even got the photo I gave
you for Christmas up in your office.

32:12.349 --> 32:14.017
Just a picture of dumb Americans.

32:14.977 --> 32:17.354
Now you're gonna play Nate's false nine,
so when the team fuck up,

32:17.437 --> 32:19.606
which they will, hey,
you can blame it on me.

32:19.690 --> 32:21.108
Well, no. Fuck that.

32:24.361 --> 32:26.196
Everybody loves you.

32:27.322 --> 32:30.534
The Great Ted Lasso.
Well, I think you're a fucking joke.

32:31.451 --> 32:33.078
Without me,
you wouldn't have won a single match.

32:33.161 --> 32:35.372
They would've shipped your ass
back to Kansas, where you belong.

32:35.455 --> 32:36.540
With your son.

32:38.750 --> 32:41.170
'Cause you sure as hell
don't belong here.

32:42.963 --> 32:46.175
But I do. I belong here.

32:46.258 --> 32:49.386
This didn't just fall into my lap,
all right? I earned this.

32:49.469 --> 32:50.637
I know you did, Nate.

32:51.471 --> 32:54.308
And if I didn't tell you how important you
were to me enough, I'm sorry about that.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.393
No, no. You know what?
You're full of shit.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.561
Just fuck you, Ted.

33:04.902 --> 33:09.031
Richmond down two,
sticking with their false nine formation

33:09.114 --> 33:10.741
as Brentford are on the attack.

33:10.824 --> 33:15.537
Chris, is time running out on Richmond's
chances to control their future?

33:15.621 --> 33:17.956
Only if you think of time as linear, Arlo.

33:18.624 --> 33:19.875
Yes, Chris. I do.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.254
Good pressure from Rojas.

33:25.756 --> 33:27.257
That's lovely from Tartt.

33:27.341 --> 33:29.134
Obisanya is in.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.219
He scores!

33:33.305 --> 33:35.766
And thanks to that Obisanya goal,

33:35.849 --> 33:38.894
Richmond's hopes for promotion
are still alive.

33:38.977 --> 33:42.272
Let's go! Let's go! Come on! One more!

33:43.941 --> 33:45.359
Oh, my God!

33:45.442 --> 33:47.528
That's how you play a false nine, Arlo.

33:47.611 --> 33:50.614
Pack the midfield, stay organized.
Look for the gaps. Well done.

33:50.697 --> 33:53.200
-Hey, here we go!
-Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

33:53.283 --> 33:54.993
Yes!

33:55.077 --> 33:56.870
All the other results are in.

33:56.954 --> 33:58.288
AFC Richmond,

33:58.372 --> 34:02.376
miraculously after a historically
dreadful start to the season,

34:02.459 --> 34:04.503
are only one point out of second place.

34:04.586 --> 34:07.548
Come on, Richmond.
Come on, Richmond.

34:07.631 --> 34:10.007
Come on, Richmond.
Come on, Richmond.

34:10.676 --> 34:13.094
If they can somehow salvage a draw,

34:13.178 --> 34:16.014
Richmond will be promoted
back to the Premier League.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.059
All they need is one moment
of individual brilliance, Arlo.

34:19.141 --> 34:22.437
-Come on, Richmond.
-Can they find it in time?

34:22.521 --> 34:24.313
Come on, Richmond.
Come on, Richmond.

34:24.398 --> 34:28.402
Come on, Richmond. Come on,
Richmond. Come on, Richmond…

34:28.485 --> 34:30.487
A long ball from the Dutchman.

34:31.321 --> 34:32.989
Tartt is there!

34:33.907 --> 34:35.951
Is this the moment for Richmond?

34:38.996 --> 34:40.163
Referee!

34:40.246 --> 34:41.706
Referee!

34:42.541 --> 34:43.792
It's a penalty.

34:44.751 --> 34:45.710
Yeah!

34:45.793 --> 34:47.045
-Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

34:50.132 --> 34:52.384
We have to think
Tartt will be the one to take it.

34:52.467 --> 34:54.178
He hasn't missed a penalty all season.

35:06.148 --> 35:07.399
Dani.

35:12.279 --> 35:13.697
You got this, muchacho.

35:14.698 --> 35:16.283
It'll be fun. Trust me.

35:18.118 --> 35:20.621
It looks like Tartt
is giving the ball to Rojas,

35:20.704 --> 35:24.291
who hasn't kicked a penalty since, well…

35:32.049 --> 35:34.009
Come on, Dani!

35:51.610 --> 35:52.694
Let's go, Dani!

35:52.778 --> 35:53.862
Here we go, Dani!

36:15.467 --> 36:17.344
Football is life.

36:26.854 --> 36:28.730
Richmond have done it!

36:28.814 --> 36:30.983
With that goal,
they'll finish in second place

36:31.066 --> 36:35.112
and will return to the Premier League
in their very first attempt.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.573
We are going up!
We are going up!

36:37.656 --> 36:40.659
We are going up!
Yeah, we are going up!

36:40.742 --> 36:41.743
Yeah!

36:41.827 --> 36:43.620
It's all over!

36:43.704 --> 36:45.956
Richmond have done the impossible

36:46.039 --> 36:49.918
through grit, determination
and most of all belief!

36:50.002 --> 36:52.504
I was promoted a time or two
in my career, Arlo.

36:52.588 --> 36:53.922
It's a real achievement.

36:54.006 --> 36:55.090
Richmond deserve this.

36:55.174 --> 36:58.719
They remain a club without
a major trophy, it must be said.

36:58.802 --> 37:00.971
But it won't feel that way tonight.

37:01.054 --> 37:04.516
Final score: Richmond 2, Brentford 2.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.728
And the joy is back at Nelson Road.

37:09.813 --> 37:12.357
-Yeah!
-Hey! Come on! Come on!

37:12.941 --> 37:14.943
Fucking hell!
What'd you do that for?

37:15.027 --> 37:17.070
So I could do this.

37:19.198 --> 37:22.326
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

37:22.409 --> 37:26.496
Yes! Let's go!

37:26.580 --> 37:28.665
Yeah!

37:31.084 --> 37:32.127
Yeah!

37:32.211 --> 37:33.670
-You want some water?
-Yes, please.

37:40.302 --> 37:42.471
We're Richmond till we die

37:42.554 --> 37:44.932
We know we are, we're sure we are
We're Richmond till we die

37:45.015 --> 37:47.976
We're Richmond till we die
We're Richmond till we die

37:48.060 --> 37:50.979
We know we are, we're sure we are
We're Richmond till we die

37:51.063 --> 37:54.191
We're Richmond till we die
We're Richmond till we die

37:54.274 --> 37:57.319
We know we are, we're sure we are
We're Richmond till we die

37:57.402 --> 37:58.820
We're Richmond till we die

37:58.904 --> 38:00.364
Sam.

38:00.447 --> 38:02.157
We know we are, we're sure we are

38:02.241 --> 38:06.662
We're Richmond till we die
We're Richmond till we die

38:06.745 --> 38:09.498
We know we are, we're sure we are
We're Richmond till we die

38:13.043 --> 38:16.171
Sam! Hey. Sammo, hey.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.382
Excellent performance.

38:18.465 --> 38:20.592
Yeah, the goal, of course,
speaks for itself, yeah.

38:20.676 --> 38:24.179
But your tactical discipline, hey.

38:24.263 --> 38:26.223
They are certainly
going to miss you around here.

38:28.016 --> 38:29.351
Mr. Akufo.

38:29.434 --> 38:33.730
I truly enjoyed meeting you,
and I'm so flattered by your offer.

38:35.357 --> 38:37.276
I'm sorry, but my answer is,
"No, thank you."

38:40.112 --> 38:42.948
And I don't believe
my time here at Richmond is over.

38:43.031 --> 38:44.992
And for that reason, I have to stay.

38:46.660 --> 38:47.953
I hope you can understand.

38:51.373 --> 38:53.458
You Nigerian motherfucker!

38:54.710 --> 38:56.712
You Yoruba trash.

38:56.795 --> 38:59.256
Who the fuck do you think you are,
wasting my time?

38:59.339 --> 39:01.633
You medium-talent piece of shit.

39:01.717 --> 39:02.885
"Medium-talent"?

39:02.968 --> 39:07.139
I will dedicate my life to destroying you,
you fucking asshole!

39:07.222 --> 39:10.767
You will never play
on the Nigerian national team.

39:11.977 --> 39:13.770
You understand me, pinky-dick? Never!

39:14.938 --> 39:18.859
I will buy your childhood home,
and I will take a shit in every room.

39:18.942 --> 39:20.319
And then I will burn the place down.

39:20.402 --> 39:22.362
Yeah. Then, I will sit there,
and I'll eat kenkey,

39:22.446 --> 39:25.073
and I'll poop on the fucking ashes.
I promise you this, hey.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.618
Okay.

39:27.701 --> 39:29.786
I will never forget this disrespect.

39:29.870 --> 39:31.205
Fuck you, Sam Obisanya.

39:37.336 --> 39:38.504
Fucking dare!

39:41.215 --> 39:42.508
That dick!

39:52.851 --> 39:54.019
Yes.

39:55.437 --> 39:57.397
Poop, poop.

40:00.192 --> 40:01.818
Okay, y'all. Hey, settle down, y'all.

40:01.902 --> 40:03.570
Okay, okay. Easy, easy now.
Easy. Hey, hey.

40:03.654 --> 40:06.740
Y'all, come on. Calm down, all right?
Look--

40:06.823 --> 40:09.952
Well, right off the cricket bat here,
I wanna address the article

40:10.035 --> 40:12.246
written by our good friend,
Mr. Trent Crimm from The…

40:17.125 --> 40:20.671
Or rather,
I want to share with y'all the truth

40:20.754 --> 40:22.965
about my recent struggles with anxiety.

40:25.926 --> 40:28.470
And, well, my overall concern

40:28.554 --> 40:31.890
about the way we discuss
and deal with mental health in athletics.

40:36.436 --> 40:40.065
Hey, boss. Just wanted to congratulate you
on your promotion.

40:40.148 --> 40:43.277
You too, Ted. Champagne to celebrate?

40:43.360 --> 40:46.113
-I'll just take a glass of water, please.
-Still or sparkling?

40:48.198 --> 40:50.075
Yes. Still. Right.

40:50.158 --> 40:52.327
You know, before living here,
I used to think still water

40:52.411 --> 40:54.830
was just folks saying it's still water,
you know?

40:54.913 --> 40:59.209
Like, it was water, and it continues
to remain to be water.

40:59.293 --> 41:01.879
Well, there's no greater education
than travel.

41:01.962 --> 41:04.089
A-freaking-men.

41:06.842 --> 41:09.136
Well, hey. Next season
should be fun, right?

41:09.219 --> 41:11.638
Well, one that'll include an old friend.

41:13.098 --> 41:15.350
Rupert's bought West Ham United.

41:15.434 --> 41:16.768
Did he now?

41:17.769 --> 41:19.354
Well, that'll be a nice change.

41:20.856 --> 41:22.566
Having our run-ins with him
being scheduled,

41:22.649 --> 41:24.484
as opposed to his normal sneak attacks.

41:27.362 --> 41:28.572
Hi, Rebecca.

41:29.031 --> 41:30.324
And Coach.

41:32.284 --> 41:33.285
Sorry.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.662
No. Hey. Sam, go ahead. Stick around.
I was getting ready to leave.

41:35.746 --> 41:37.664
-No, Ted. Stay.
-No, no, no, no. It's okay.

41:38.498 --> 41:39.583
Yeah. Okay.

41:44.087 --> 41:47.132
I just wanted to let you both know

41:47.216 --> 41:49.676
that I've decided to stay.

41:53.430 --> 41:54.765
Hey, that's great, Sam.

41:57.518 --> 41:59.520
Yes. I'm glad to hear that, Sam.

42:02.523 --> 42:05.609
How did Edwin Akufo take the news?

42:07.194 --> 42:10.155
Not well. He stormed off.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.782
He's already halfway back to Ghana.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.408
Oh, shoot. I was really looking forward

42:13.492 --> 42:15.577
to that goodbye handshake from Francis.

42:18.914 --> 42:21.792
Well, I should go.

42:22.501 --> 42:25.128
Hey, Sam. I was just curious.

42:25.212 --> 42:28.173
What-- Why'd you decide to stay?

42:35.806 --> 42:38.058
I wish I could say
it was because of my feelings for you,

42:40.853 --> 42:45.190
but the truth is, I think I need to stop
worrying about how others feel about me.

42:46.024 --> 42:49.528
I'm staying because it's what's best
for me and my personal journey.

43:06.253 --> 43:07.254
Thank you.

43:13.927 --> 43:16.013
He might have been talking to you
when he was looking at me.

43:16.096 --> 43:18.765
Yes. I know that, Ted.

43:26.440 --> 43:29.109
-Oh, hell. You crushed that.
-Yeah.

43:33.322 --> 43:34.406
Coach Lasso.

43:35.532 --> 43:38.452
Hey. There he is. I was worried about you.

43:38.535 --> 43:40.329
I thought you might've been
in a bike accident.

43:40.412 --> 43:42.623
Actually,
I don't know how to ride a bicycle.

43:42.706 --> 43:44.583
Really? That surprises me.

43:44.666 --> 43:47.711
Why?
'Cause of the hair and the whole vibe?

43:47.794 --> 43:49.463
Yeah, I guess so.

43:49.546 --> 43:51.381
Why the heck
weren't you at the press conference?

43:51.465 --> 43:53.592
Because I am no longer a reporter.

43:53.675 --> 43:56.762
I was fired when they found out
I revealed an anonymous source.

43:56.845 --> 43:59.389
Oh, snap.
I didn't say anything, I promise.

43:59.473 --> 44:01.642
No, I know, Ted. I did.

44:02.976 --> 44:05.729
I'm looking for something different.
Deeper.

44:06.980 --> 44:08.899
Well, as the man says,
you gotta follow your bliss, right?

44:09.608 --> 44:10.901
Sorry you're out of a job.

44:10.984 --> 44:12.736
You know what this makes you now,
though, right?

44:13.654 --> 44:15.656
Trent Crimm. Independent.

44:15.739 --> 44:16.949
Yeah.

44:17.032 --> 44:19.493
Yeah, yeah. My father made the same joke.

44:19.576 --> 44:21.036
Yeah. He sounds like a cool guy.

44:22.371 --> 44:24.456
Well, I hope our paths cross again soon,
Trent.

44:25.123 --> 44:27.751
As do I, Ted. I love our chats.

44:29.711 --> 44:30.796
You want a ride?

44:31.588 --> 44:33.715
Well, I prefer to walk,
but I appreciate ya.

44:33.799 --> 44:34.842
And Ted,

44:36.760 --> 44:38.011
good luck next season.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.356
Shit.

45:02.995 --> 45:06.665
-This the last of it?
-Yeah. Just these and Trixibelle.

45:06.748 --> 45:07.749
Right.

45:07.833 --> 45:11.920
I got you a last-day-
working-in-the-same-building present.

45:12.004 --> 45:13.005
Here.

45:16.884 --> 45:18.177
Airplane tickets?

45:19.136 --> 45:20.554
You got me airplane tickets?

45:20.637 --> 45:22.181
To Marbella.

45:22.264 --> 45:24.558
How did you get actual printed tickets?

45:24.641 --> 45:27.436
From my travel agent, Kathy.
She's old-school.

45:27.519 --> 45:30.647
Roy, are you sure
they still take paper tickets at airports?

45:30.731 --> 45:32.232
Like, is the plane gonna have propellers?

45:32.316 --> 45:34.318
Oh, my God. Am I gonna be able
to smoke on the flight?

45:34.401 --> 45:37.279
Right, stop it. You are missing the point.

45:38.447 --> 45:40.407
Tomorrow, you and I

45:40.490 --> 45:44.620
are going to a villa by the sea
for six weeks

45:44.703 --> 45:47.956
so you can chill out before
you start kicking ass in your new job.

45:48.790 --> 45:52.127
And I'm going to take the first holiday
I've taken since I was 12,

45:52.211 --> 45:55.297
where I don't have to stay in shape
or rehab my fucking knee.

45:56.298 --> 45:59.927
I'm gonna gorge myself to death on tapas,

46:00.010 --> 46:02.888
and it will take fucking ages.

46:05.390 --> 46:08.018
Babe, thank you.

46:16.401 --> 46:18.111
But I can't go.

46:20.030 --> 46:21.573
What? Why not?

46:21.657 --> 46:23.909
I don't start work in six weeks.

46:23.992 --> 46:26.787
-I started like a week ago.
-Yeah, I know.

46:26.870 --> 46:29.790
That's why I made sure the place
has got proper Wi-Fi and everything.

46:29.873 --> 46:34.127
You can do all your emails and shit,
but from a balcony with a sea view.

46:34.211 --> 46:38.048
Roy, I'd love to. But I can't.

46:39.967 --> 46:41.510
I just can't.

46:43.095 --> 46:44.805
But you should go.

46:51.895 --> 46:53.272
Are we breaking up?

46:53.355 --> 46:56.692
No. Why would you say that?

46:56.775 --> 46:58.777
Of course not.

46:58.861 --> 47:01.530
You are gonna take a well-earned holiday

47:03.031 --> 47:05.200
while I lock myself in a dark room
and work nonstop.

47:07.369 --> 47:09.371
And I'll see you in six weeks.

47:11.456 --> 47:12.457
Keeley.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.878
Roy. I love you.

47:16.795 --> 47:18.255
We'll be fine.

47:19.631 --> 47:21.300
I'll see you in six weeks.

48:10.933 --> 48:12.184
Congratulations.

48:19.775 --> 48:20.984
What's it gonna be?

48:23.862 --> 48:25.697
A Nigerian restaurant.

48:42.256 --> 48:45.634
-Move! I want it faster! Go!
-Coach! Sir!

48:45.717 --> 48:47.511
-Move!
-Coach!

48:47.594 --> 48:49.596
-Next. Go.
-Sir!

48:49.680 --> 48:51.515
-Move it!
-Coach!

48:51.598 --> 48:53.684
-Go!
-Sir!

48:56.979 --> 48:59.439
-Move! Go!
-Coach!

49:01.024 --> 49:03.944
-Move! Go!
-Coach! Sir!

49:04.027 --> 49:05.779
-Move!
-Coach!
