01:38.016 --> 01:39.976
Wake up. Wake up.

01:41.060 --> 01:42.312
Wake up.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.416
I cut the power.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.917
We've got about ten seconds

02:05.001 --> 02:07.086
before that alarm
brings an entire team down here.

02:07.170 --> 02:08.338
Here.

02:10.340 --> 02:11.716
- We need to go.
- Okay, go.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.472
Go.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.673
Okay, come on.

03:13.945 --> 03:14.946
I love you.

03:15.947 --> 03:17.281
You tell me now?

03:27.083 --> 03:28.084
I love you.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.640
Go!

04:02.577 --> 04:04.620
No! No! No!

04:10.877 --> 04:12.086
Let go.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.255
You have to go now.

04:14.714 --> 04:16.257
- No. I won't leave you.
- Let go.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.966
- No.
- I promise I'll find you.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.594
You have to go.

04:20.344 --> 04:21.345
Go! Go!

04:52.126 --> 04:54.295
You have another nightmare?

04:54.378 --> 04:55.504
Yeah.

04:56.005 --> 04:58.758
Baby, what are we going to do with you?

05:01.427 --> 05:03.346
I don't know.

05:03.429 --> 05:04.513
Do you want to talk about it?

05:05.514 --> 05:07.725
There's nothing to talk about.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.395
Same dream?

05:14.357 --> 05:15.441
Same dream.

05:18.945 --> 05:20.279
Same time.

05:21.948 --> 05:24.408
I'm trapped, being chased.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.702
Can't get away.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.080
And then I wake.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.457
And that's it?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.585
It's just you, nobody else?

05:35.753 --> 05:38.297
No. Just me.

05:39.882 --> 05:41.008
Is it me?

05:41.425 --> 05:42.802
Is what you?

05:43.678 --> 05:44.887
I don't know.

05:45.763 --> 05:49.058
You're alone. You can't get away.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.519
Is it us?

05:51.602 --> 05:53.688
- Do I make you feel trapped?
- No.

05:55.606 --> 05:56.649
Babe,

05:56.983 --> 05:59.151
I know this isn't exactly

05:59.235 --> 06:01.320
what we had in mind when
we were younger, but...

06:01.404 --> 06:02.446
This castle?

06:04.115 --> 06:07.159
Who gets everything
they fantasize about, right?

06:10.579 --> 06:11.914
I got you.

06:12.540 --> 06:13.749
Come here.

06:16.794 --> 06:19.463
It's just a dream. That's all it is.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.465
Okay?

06:26.846 --> 06:28.681
Well, we're going to have to
get you some better dreams.

06:29.432 --> 06:30.933
That would be nice.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.315
Oh, come on.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.027
- Shit.
- What is it?

06:42.862 --> 06:44.739
Another bombing in the U.F.B.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.365
Passenger train.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.950
Goddamn Resistance.

06:51.996 --> 06:54.332
I'm going to have to
catch the 6:30 departure.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.335
They're calling
all emergency personnel to go up top.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.254
I got to go.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.760
We'll pick this up tonight, okay?

07:10.723 --> 07:11.974
Try and get a little sleep.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.684
Sleep scares me.

07:14.852 --> 07:17.313
Well, dream of me.

07:17.396 --> 07:18.564
Okay.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.524
But not in these pants.

07:23.694 --> 07:27.281
<i>The bomb went off just moments
after the commuters boarded.</i>

07:30.368 --> 07:32.953
<i>We are being told rescue teams
are still searching for survivors.</i>

07:33.037 --> 07:36.582
<i>The death toll is at 144 and still rising.</i>

07:36.665 --> 07:40.795
<i>This marks the fourth attack in United
Federation of Britain in as many months.</i>

07:41.504 --> 07:44.298
<i>And all signs point
to terrorist leader Matthias</i>

07:44.382 --> 07:46.175
<i>and his Resistance movement.</i>

07:46.258 --> 07:49.095
<i>The U. F.B. exploits us.</i>

07:49.178 --> 07:52.681
<i>The workers of The Colony deserve equality.</i>

07:53.140 --> 07:56.227
<i>The Fall enslaves us all.</i>

07:56.310 --> 07:58.312
<i>Chancellor Cohaagen
pointed to this as proof</i>

07:58.396 --> 08:00.398
<i>that Matthias does not seek a peaceful path</i>

08:00.481 --> 08:04.819
<i>to independence for The Colony,
but rather a prolonged and bloody conflict.</i>

08:04.902 --> 08:08.406
<i>And with overpopulation
figures in the U. F.B. continuing to rise,</i>

08:08.489 --> 08:10.533
<i>this could not come at a worse time.</i>

08:10.616 --> 08:12.743
<i>You'll recall the last attack
occurred six weeks ago.</i>

08:13.619 --> 08:17.915
<i>Federal police have since attributed
that bombing to this man, Carl Hauser,</i>

08:17.998 --> 08:20.126
<i>a former intelligence
officer turned traitor</i>

08:20.334 --> 08:22.795
<i>now considered to be
Matthias' right-hand man.</i>

08:22.878 --> 08:26.757
<i>No word yet as to whether Hauser
had a role in this morning's incident.</i>

09:03.544 --> 09:05.379
<i>Going somewhere? No?</i>

09:05.463 --> 09:07.173
<i>Well, don't let that stop you.</i>

09:07.256 --> 09:10.050
<i>That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?</i>

09:10.176 --> 09:11.510
<i>Not any more.</i>

09:11.594 --> 09:13.387
<i>At Rekall, we'll provide you</i>

09:13.471 --> 09:16.223
<i>with a complete set
of memories all your own.</i>

09:16.307 --> 09:17.266
<i>Rekall.</i>

09:17.349 --> 09:19.477
<i>We can remember it for you.</i>

09:31.197 --> 09:34.992
<i>All passengers, please report
to your designated gates.</i>

09:35.784 --> 09:39.371
<i>This is the final boarding call
for the 7:15 departure.</i>

09:56.722 --> 09:58.182
Wake up to the truth!

09:58.265 --> 10:00.851
Cohaagen is counting on your complacency.

10:00.935 --> 10:03.062
Don't let them ship you
across the Earth like cattle.

10:03.145 --> 10:04.647
Come on, move.

10:07.608 --> 10:09.276
Matthias speaks the truth!

10:09.360 --> 10:10.778
The Fall enslaves us all!

10:13.072 --> 10:16.033
- Hey, buddy. You look like shit, man.
<i>- All section A departures are located...</i>

10:16.158 --> 10:17.535
- Thanks.
- No offense.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.162
I feel like shit. None taken.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.706
I ain't sleeping so well, man.

10:22.790 --> 10:25.042
Yeah, these new shifts
are kicking my ass, too.

10:25.376 --> 10:27.836
At least the extra pay
lets the missus rest easier.

10:28.879 --> 10:29.880
Look at you.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.550
<i>Mr. Glass-is-half-full at 6:00 a.m.</i>

10:32.925 --> 10:34.677
Hola. Privyet.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.470
<i>Welcome to The Fall.</i>

10:37.179 --> 10:39.265
<i>7:21 a.m.</i>

10:39.640 --> 10:43.727
<i>Travel time to United Federation
of Britain: 17 minutes.</i>

10:43.811 --> 10:46.230
<i>Dropping in 60 seconds.</i>

10:47.147 --> 10:48.816
Has it ever occurred to you

10:48.899 --> 10:51.902
that we always sit in
these exact same seats?

10:52.278 --> 10:54.196
For years now... Why?

10:54.572 --> 10:56.073
I don't know.

10:56.407 --> 10:58.242
They're seats. We have asses.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.661
Seems like the logical thing to do.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.706
I'm talking about us following
the same routine, all right,

11:03.789 --> 11:07.001
day after day, year after year
without even questioning it.

11:09.587 --> 11:10.838
Want to switch it up?

11:10.921 --> 11:12.006
No sweat.

11:12.089 --> 11:15.342
<i>Please make sure
all personal belongings are stored</i>

11:15.426 --> 11:18.137
<i>below your seat before departure.</i>

11:19.430 --> 11:20.514
Oh, yeah.

11:24.310 --> 11:26.645
Much more happening on this side.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.188
Good call.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.356
- Dick.
<i>- The Fall dropping in</i>

11:29.440 --> 11:32.651
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

11:33.110 --> 11:34.236
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

11:47.026 --> 11:49.779
<i>Despite recent talks
between Chancellor Cohaagen</i>

11:49.862 --> 11:51.322
<i>and The Colony's governor,</i>

11:51.405 --> 11:53.866
<i>the Chancellor has announced
that he will be stopping</i>

11:53.950 --> 11:57.703
<i>all humanitarian aid to The Colony
in light of this morning's bombing.</i>

11:57.995 --> 12:01.749
<i>As much as I want to focus our efforts
on cleaning up The Colony,</i>

12:02.306 --> 12:05.726
<i>today's terrorist attacks
means that funding</i>

12:05.809 --> 12:10.230
<i>will have to go to bolstering
our synthetic federal police force.</i>

12:11.148 --> 12:14.651
<i>The protection of our citizens
will always come first.</i>

12:14.735 --> 12:16.195
<i>Approaching core.</i>

12:16.904 --> 12:19.365
<i>Please prepare for gravity reversal.</i>

12:50.270 --> 12:55.442
<i>Security elevated to level three.
Please remain in scanners until cleared.</i>

12:59.154 --> 13:02.658
<i>Looks like that bomb set off
a hell of a panic up here.</i>

13:03.450 --> 13:08.497
<i>Identification documents must be in hand and
ready to present to the security officer</i>

13:08.580 --> 13:10.999
<i>before entering the screening area.</i>

13:15.129 --> 13:19.258
<i>All factory personnel must enter
through security gate 12.</i>

13:23.053 --> 13:25.472
Hey, what do you know about Rekall?

13:26.140 --> 13:28.016
- That mind-altering shit?
- Yeah.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.811
Do yourself a favor, Doug,
stay away from them.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.312
Why is that?

13:32.396 --> 13:33.981
Remember Travis from shift three?

13:34.273 --> 13:37.109
- Travis.
- Went to Rekall for his bachelor party.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.529
Wanted to be king of Mars or some shit.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.114
I'd like to go to Mars.

13:42.906 --> 13:44.700
Got himself lobotomized.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.202
<i>Any available biometric tech,
please report to the...</i>

13:47.286 --> 13:48.701
- You believe those stories?
<i>- ...central office...</i>

13:49.163 --> 13:50.289
- About Rekall?
- Yeah.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.832
Yeah, I do.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.335
Come on.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.088
You never thought about
it, just a little bit?

13:58.172 --> 13:59.256
I don't need to think about it.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.050
Don't mess with your mind, man.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.510
It ain't worth it.

14:03.594 --> 14:04.761
All right, all right, listen up.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.597
Maybe I need my mind messed with.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.973
We're starting double shifts again.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.850
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:10.851 --> 14:11.852
- Don't blame me.
- Fuck me.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.688
I don't want to be here
any longer than you do, okay?

14:14.771 --> 14:16.315
They've increased
the production of police synthetics

14:16.398 --> 14:17.774
thanks to that shit this morning, so...

14:17.858 --> 14:19.401
So take all your complaints

14:19.485 --> 14:21.361
to Chancellor Cohaagen.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.989
Now, which one of you
fine, upstanding assholes

14:24.072 --> 14:25.115
wants to train the new guy?

14:25.616 --> 14:26.617
Come on.

14:27.201 --> 14:28.368
Hey.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.661
Come on.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.165
Don't look at me.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.417
I trained the last guy you fired.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.463
- Quaid.
- Yeah.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.006
You're up.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.927
- Great. Thank you.
- Any time.

14:46.637 --> 14:48.472
Synthetics coming down!

14:48.972 --> 14:51.642
<i>Section three weld scanners are
temporarily offline.</i>

15:01.276 --> 15:03.070
Don't hold it like that.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.363
Hold it here.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.490
If you hold it there and the synth shorts,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.742
one of those bolts
will shoot straight through your hand.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.327
No shit, huh?

15:11.286 --> 15:12.496
No shit.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.958
Easier ways to get a day off.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.168
Thanks.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.631
Hey, you know, your friend
was wrong, by the way.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.174
About Rekall.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.593
What, you've done it?

15:26.677 --> 15:28.011
Been three times already.

15:28.262 --> 15:29.471
Really?

15:30.222 --> 15:31.348
Best memories I have.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.517
A whole lot better than this shit.

15:35.477 --> 15:36.520
Hey.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.356
Ask for Mac.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.192
Okay? You're going to thank me.

15:45.529 --> 15:49.283
<i>Level nine,
please report to Human Resources.</i>

15:52.661 --> 15:55.205
Strap yourself in.
This guy's a laugh-a-minute.

15:56.373 --> 15:57.374
Next.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.462
Here you are. Please, have a seat.

16:05.007 --> 16:06.925
You work on the production line.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.219
In activation, yeah.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.388
I understand you live in The Colony.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.307
Yeah, I make the commute
like everyone else.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.101
Sorry, who are you?
If you don't mind my asking.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.895
- I'm with the Cohaagen administration.
- I see.

16:19.771 --> 16:26.153
Given these politically charged times, there
is a heightened concern regarding the,

16:26.236 --> 16:30.324
shall we say, loyalty of our workers.

16:30.407 --> 16:32.951
- Yeah, but I don't work for you.
- But you do.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.579
This company was granted
the government contract for police synths,

16:35.662 --> 16:39.916
and we are, the last time I checked,
the government.

16:40.584 --> 16:44.296
Okay, I see. So you brought me in here
because of where I live.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.714
We're bringing in all the employees.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.592
Oh, really? Who's questioning the suits?

16:49.051 --> 16:50.385
Who gets to question you?

16:50.469 --> 16:51.595
Mr. Quaid,

16:52.888 --> 16:57.351
in your capacity here, you are privy to police
synth technology that is currently classified.

16:57.434 --> 17:00.479
I know how to turn 'em on,
if that's what you mean.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.315
We'd like you to sign this.

17:03.899 --> 17:05.025
And what is that?

17:05.108 --> 17:08.362
It affirms that you will not
divulge proprietary technology

17:08.444 --> 17:10.446
to any source, either foreign or domestic.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.616
And that you are not actively engaged

17:12.699 --> 17:16.203
in any attempt to overthrow
this administration.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.872
You want me to sign something
that says I'm not a terrorist?

17:18.954 --> 17:22.667
The document merely affirms
you are who you say you are.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.086
And if I were a terrorist,

17:24.169 --> 17:26.253
you think this would make me tell you?

17:26.338 --> 17:27.964
- Is that your guy's big plan?
- Mr. Quaid...

17:28.048 --> 17:29.383
You catch anyone yet?

17:29.466 --> 17:32.094
I have 75 more of these interviews today.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.887
Yeah, you know what, pal?
I had a long day, too.

17:33.970 --> 17:38.475
Well, if you'd like to have another,
you'll shut up and do what you're told.

17:40.268 --> 17:41.561
Wow.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.441
Second page at the bottom.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.237
You like your job?

17:50.904 --> 17:52.864
I'm a people person.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.243
Thank you.

17:59.788 --> 18:00.789
Next.

18:00.872 --> 18:03.583
<i>Gates nine through 18 now closed.</i>

18:03.667 --> 18:06.044
<i>Section A departures will reopen in 40...</i>

19:14.613 --> 19:15.655
All right, finally.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.240
- Cheers. Salud.
- Yeah. Jesus.

19:17.574 --> 19:18.700
Hey, buddy.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.494
- Hey.
- Glad you called.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.661
Needed a drink.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.663
Lori working tonight?

19:24.456 --> 19:25.582
Yeah.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.417
Hey, Murray. Same.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.590
You ever learn how to play the piano?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.842
Yeah, I always wanted
to learn to play the piano.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.013
What's with you today?

19:40.847 --> 19:41.848
What?

19:41.932 --> 19:43.558
Yeah, exactly.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.185
You've been zoned out all day.

19:49.272 --> 19:52.150
I've been having these dreams.

19:52.651 --> 19:53.735
Dreams?

19:53.819 --> 19:55.821
Yeah, feels

19:57.197 --> 19:58.698
like I'm doing something...

19:58.782 --> 20:00.367
Something...

20:00.909 --> 20:03.203
Something that matters,
something important, you know?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.456
Nope, not so much.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.794
You don't think what we do is important?

20:14.798 --> 20:17.008
Really? Come on, Harry.

20:17.843 --> 20:20.887
We commute halfway
around the world for shit jobs,

20:20.971 --> 20:25.308
for shit pay, to come to this shit bar
and get drunk on too much shit beer.

20:26.476 --> 20:28.728
- No offense, Murray.
- Yeah.

20:31.064 --> 20:34.192
What? Are you actually happy
with how your life's turned out?

20:35.151 --> 20:37.404
- Why the hell shouldn't I be?
- Are you serious?

20:37.487 --> 20:38.655
Is there something wrong with it?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.615
No. You know what? You're right. Forget it.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.075
I'm just...

20:42.784 --> 20:44.119
Forget it.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.328
Who's the girl?

20:46.496 --> 20:47.581
What do you mean?

20:47.664 --> 20:49.499
You heard me. Who's the girl?

20:50.584 --> 20:52.752
There's no girl. It's just me.

20:53.712 --> 20:54.963
Good.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.593
'Cause women like Lori
don't just fall out of the sky.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.345
You're a lucky man.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.974
You're living the dream, my friend.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.100
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.518
- I'm living the dream?
- Yeah.

21:13.857 --> 21:16.026
All right, big guy. Tomorrow.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.278
Hey.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.197
My advice?

21:21.531 --> 21:22.699
Go ahead.

21:23.783 --> 21:27.287
Figure out a way to deal with whatever
the hell it is you're going through

21:27.370 --> 21:29.956
before you mess your shit up for good.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.878
It's possible I might have drank too much.

21:36.212 --> 21:37.255
Yeah, it's possible, Harry.

21:38.423 --> 21:40.050
I'm going to go throw up on something now.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.385
- Okay.
- And you're going to get your shit together

21:42.886 --> 21:45.055
and go home to your wife, you hear me?

21:46.389 --> 21:47.515
Yeah, I think everyone heard you, Harry.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.187
Night, Dougie.

21:52.896 --> 21:54.230
Good night.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.122
Seem like you're looking for something.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.624
Is it this?

22:56.459 --> 22:58.169
Anything goes here.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.631
Trust me, baby,
you're gonna wish you had three hands.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.092
I'm looking for Rekall.

23:04.509 --> 23:06.052
You know where I can find it?

23:06.136 --> 23:08.388
Stairway to heaven, over there.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.643
Sure I can't change your mind?
I'm a lot more interactive.

23:14.853 --> 23:16.146
I bet.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.106
Thank you.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.391
Welcome to Rekall.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.852
First time?

23:56.144 --> 23:57.854
Yeah. That obvious, huh?

23:58.480 --> 23:59.606
It's fine.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.566
There's nothing to be afraid of.

24:02.258 --> 24:03.635
This is a safe place.

24:06.304 --> 24:09.891
My friend Marek gave me this card,
told me to ask for Mac.

24:16.898 --> 24:19.442
- He's right inside.
- Thanks.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.873
Remember to have a good time.

24:40.130 --> 24:41.214
Welcome.

24:41.423 --> 24:42.465
Hey.

24:42.966 --> 24:44.467
You're a friend of Marek's.

24:44.718 --> 24:46.094
Yes.

24:46.720 --> 24:49.639
Yeah, we work together.

24:50.890 --> 24:51.933
Is that it?

24:53.560 --> 24:54.561
That is it.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.479
And it feels like real life?

24:57.981 --> 25:00.233
What is life but our brain's
chemical perception of it?

25:00.984 --> 25:03.528
Your eyes see, your brain chemistry reacts.

25:03.611 --> 25:06.239
Here, we just remove the middleman
and we go straight to the chemistry.

25:06.865 --> 25:08.241
Does that make it any less real?

25:08.908 --> 25:12.537
An illusion, no matter how convincing,
is still just an illusion.

25:12.620 --> 25:14.247
That's very good.

25:14.831 --> 25:16.041
You're right, objectively.

25:17.042 --> 25:18.835
But from the inside,

25:19.127 --> 25:20.670
subjectively...

25:21.337 --> 25:23.256
I assure you, it's quite
the opposite entirely.

25:24.007 --> 25:25.050
Listen, I get it.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.217
I get it.

25:26.301 --> 25:28.094
You're here because
you feel like something's missing.

25:28.178 --> 25:31.264
You got some tug, some longing
for something more.

25:31.347 --> 25:33.099
We're going to give you that thing.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.350
Is that right?

25:36.102 --> 25:37.979
Could be something
you could never afford to do.

25:38.063 --> 25:42.150
Something secret you've always wanted
to try, but you would never, ever dare.

25:42.233 --> 25:43.943
What do you mean, secret?

25:44.027 --> 25:45.195
Anything.

25:45.278 --> 25:47.864
Tell us your fantasy.
We'll give you the memory.

25:48.865 --> 25:50.450
You want to be rich and famous?

25:50.533 --> 25:51.910
Worshiped by millions?

25:52.327 --> 25:53.912
Maybe something
with a little more adrenaline, huh?

25:53.995 --> 25:56.748
Crime fighter? Or world-class athlete?

25:57.499 --> 25:59.793
Secret agent. That's you. Right?

26:00.085 --> 26:01.377
Clandestine bank accounts,

26:01.544 --> 26:03.046
coded messages.
- Secret agent.

26:03.421 --> 26:04.756
I could do that.

26:04.839 --> 26:06.758
Yeah, as an intelligence operative.

26:07.467 --> 26:08.927
You could be working for the Resistance.

26:09.219 --> 26:11.763
Maybe you work for Cohaagen.

26:12.055 --> 26:13.598
Or why limit yourself? Why not both?

26:18.895 --> 26:20.188
One last thing, Doug.

26:20.271 --> 26:22.565
As a matter of full disclosure,

26:23.750 --> 26:27.337
none of the secret life elements
you chose can actually be true.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.466
See, the thing is, a lot of guys

26:31.549 --> 26:33.509
come in here, they want
the secret mistress trip

26:33.593 --> 26:35.929
when they already have one,
a real one, on the side.

26:36.012 --> 26:37.055
We can't do that.

26:37.931 --> 26:39.807
It would cause
irreparable conflict and confusion.

26:39.891 --> 26:41.768
That's how brains get blown.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.728
Don't worry, I don't have any secrets.

26:43.895 --> 26:45.605
I'm sure you don't, but just in case,

26:45.688 --> 26:47.774
we're going to run
a psycho-polygraphic panel on you anyway.

26:47.857 --> 26:49.025
Marcus, go.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.250
You're going to have such a good time,

27:05.333 --> 27:07.669
you're not going to want to come back.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.547
Look at that.

27:12.048 --> 27:15.093
Looks like your wife
does have a man who appreciates her.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.844
No conflict there.

27:18.429 --> 27:21.057
Sorry. Still the best way
to get chemicals into the human body.

27:23.977 --> 27:25.144
All right.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.896
Let's get this show on the road.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.107
Get ready to save the world.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.779
Happy trails, man.

27:34.904 --> 27:37.407
You can tell me all about
it when you get...

27:37.824 --> 27:39.033
Wait.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.326
What?

27:40.410 --> 27:41.411
Shit.

27:41.494 --> 27:42.495
Shit? What is it? What's wrong?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.664
Yank that needle out before it takes.

27:45.248 --> 27:46.332
What is it? What's wrong?

27:46.416 --> 27:47.750
- You lied.
- Lied about what?

27:47.834 --> 27:49.669
- Son of a bitch.
- Look, I don't have a mistress.

27:49.752 --> 27:50.753
- What are you talking about?
- Mistress?

27:50.837 --> 27:51.921
You're a goddamn spy.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.299
Vitals are everywhere.

27:54.966 --> 27:56.467
Why are you here? Why?

27:57.635 --> 27:59.262
Federal police!

28:05.685 --> 28:07.520
- Federal police! On your feet now!
- No, wait!

28:07.603 --> 28:09.230
This is all a mistake! It's all...

28:10.481 --> 28:11.524
I'm nobody.

28:12.843 --> 28:15.012
- I'm nobody.
- Hands on your head now!

28:15.179 --> 28:16.263
Okay.

28:18.932 --> 28:20.350
Turn around!

28:22.853 --> 28:23.979
Okay.

28:45.542 --> 28:46.877
Holy shit.

28:51.632 --> 28:54.426
<i>118.5, code six. 105 north...</i>

28:58.388 --> 28:59.473
Go!

28:59.723 --> 29:00.974
Move, move, move!

29:01.058 --> 29:02.267
Federal police!

29:15.906 --> 29:16.990
Team one, have you

29:17.074 --> 29:18.242
<i>secured the suspect?</i>

29:18.575 --> 29:21.203
<i>Team one, advise.
Let me know what's going on in there.</i>

29:22.287 --> 29:24.873
Stevens, get an eyeball in there now.

30:23.640 --> 30:25.392
Shit. They're all down.

30:25.475 --> 30:26.643
He's all alone!

30:26.727 --> 30:28.312
Let's punch it.

30:43.036 --> 30:45.205
Fall back! Fall back!

30:46.039 --> 30:47.666
Cover the exit!

31:20.031 --> 31:21.658
<i>In what is being described</i>

31:21.741 --> 31:25.287
<i>as a terrorist attack,
a solitary gunman opened fire</i>

31:25.370 --> 31:30.167
<i>on a squadron of federal police
at the Rekall Lounge in downtown Fremont.</i>

31:30.250 --> 31:31.376
<i>We are still awaiting word</i>

31:31.460 --> 31:34.504
<i>on precisely how many casualties there are.</i>
- Yes.

31:34.588 --> 31:36.339
<i>- But officials now confirming...</i>
- Okay.

31:36.423 --> 31:38.341
<i>...that at least 20 officers
have been killed...</i>

31:38.425 --> 31:40.093
Oh, my God, Doug.

31:40.260 --> 31:41.678
I understand. Yeah.

31:42.846 --> 31:44.014
- Thank you.
- Lori.

31:44.556 --> 31:47.225
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Of course I'm here.

31:47.309 --> 31:48.518
I've been going out of my mind.

31:48.602 --> 31:50.020
Where have you been?

31:50.103 --> 31:52.022
Look, something bad has happened.

31:52.147 --> 31:53.523
No, I know. I just got the call.

31:53.607 --> 31:54.691
We've all been put on standby.

31:55.108 --> 31:56.943
You don't understand.

31:58.153 --> 31:59.279
What?

32:06.536 --> 32:07.662
Oh, my God.

32:10.332 --> 32:11.958
Doug, are you okay?

32:12.042 --> 32:16.004
Lori, it wasn't the Resistance
who killed those sentries.

32:16.087 --> 32:17.672
It wasn't terrorists.

32:18.048 --> 32:19.382
It was me.

32:20.091 --> 32:21.134
What was you?

32:21.593 --> 32:23.220
Lori, I'm the one who killed them.

32:25.263 --> 32:27.224
You killed 20 armed men?

32:27.307 --> 32:29.476
No. No, it was more like ten.

32:30.393 --> 32:32.187
But you killed them?

32:32.312 --> 32:33.438
With what, honey, your book?

32:33.605 --> 32:36.066
- Lori, look, I'm serious.
- Doug, you're scaring me!

32:36.358 --> 32:37.692
I'm sorry.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.239
This is going to sound crazy, okay?

32:42.322 --> 32:43.615
I went to Rekall after work.

32:43.698 --> 32:44.991
- And...
- What?

32:45.075 --> 32:46.409
- What did they do to you?
- Nothing.

32:46.493 --> 32:49.412
Nothing.
I sat in the chair, they hooked me up.

32:49.496 --> 32:51.623
Before they could do anything,
the police burst in.

32:52.165 --> 32:54.084
They tried to take me.

32:54.167 --> 32:55.544
And I just reacted.

32:58.255 --> 32:59.589
And I killed them.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.800
Listen, you didn't kill anyone, Doug.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.678
Trust me, I killed everyone.

33:04.928 --> 33:07.180
No, sweetheart, don't you see?

33:08.014 --> 33:10.850
Whatever you think you did
had nothing to do with any of this.

33:11.268 --> 33:12.602
Those assholes screwed with your mind,

33:12.686 --> 33:16.022
and now you're having some
kind of a paranoid delusion.

33:16.106 --> 33:18.316
Those places are really dangerous.

33:18.483 --> 33:21.736
Whatever it is that happened,
we're going to get through it.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.488
Come here. Come on.

33:23.794 --> 33:25.087
Come on.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.964
It happened so fast.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.593
It's okay, we'll figure it out.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.890
I'm sorry.

33:40.019 --> 33:42.271
Lori, I can't breathe.

33:42.355 --> 33:43.606
Come on.

33:50.112 --> 33:51.614
What the hell are you doing?

34:01.957 --> 34:03.834
Lori, what the fuck...

34:09.590 --> 34:11.300
Lori, what the...

34:29.150 --> 34:30.652
Lori, goddamn it, what are you doing?

34:30.985 --> 34:32.154
My Job.

34:32.321 --> 34:33.572
Are you crazy?

34:33.656 --> 34:35.157
Am I crazy?

34:35.991 --> 34:37.159
That's a good one, Doug.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.036
Considering you don't even know
who the hell you are.

34:41.414 --> 34:43.581
Do you really believe
a factory worker could take out

34:43.666 --> 34:45.333
an entire room of highly-trained men?

34:58.514 --> 35:00.516
Tell me what is going on.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.767
Talk!

35:01.851 --> 35:05.187
Or we can skip straight to
"Until death do us part."

35:07.857 --> 35:09.525
I'm not your wife.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.029
That's bullshit.
We've been married seven years.

35:14.155 --> 35:17.366
I'm U.F.B. police intel,
assigned to play your wife.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.702
Six weeks ago, I didn't even know you.

35:22.246 --> 35:23.414
What are you talking about?

35:24.373 --> 35:25.708
It's true.

35:26.584 --> 35:29.378
Your memory was erased,
your mind was implanted

35:29.462 --> 35:31.922
with a life you think you've lived.

35:32.214 --> 35:33.966
You keeping up, baby?

35:34.091 --> 35:36.635
There is no Douglas Quaid, there never was.

35:36.719 --> 35:37.887
Are you saying I don't...

35:37.970 --> 35:39.180
This...

35:39.805 --> 35:41.140
Every... Our marriage...

35:41.765 --> 35:42.933
What can I say? I give good wife.

35:43.017 --> 35:44.143
Come on.

35:44.810 --> 35:46.103
Deep down, did you really believe

35:46.187 --> 35:48.564
someone like me
would marry someone like you,

35:48.647 --> 35:50.107
live in this shithole?

35:52.276 --> 35:55.571
If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?

35:56.614 --> 35:58.240
How would I know?

35:58.407 --> 35:59.492
I just work here.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.285
Speculate.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.162
If I had to guess,

36:04.121 --> 36:06.832
all the trouble Cohaagen's taken
to hide you from the Resistance,

36:06.916 --> 36:09.084
you must be fairly important.

36:10.127 --> 36:12.671
And with your skill set, I think it's
highly doubtful you're his gardener.

36:14.131 --> 36:15.466
Cohaa...

36:16.634 --> 36:18.802
Cohaagen's trying to hide me?

36:19.303 --> 36:20.638
Why are you trying to kill me?

36:22.890 --> 36:23.974
Talk!

36:25.851 --> 36:27.269
Call it seven-year itch, Doug.

36:29.772 --> 36:34.193
And by the way, you haven't even
begun to see me try to kill you!

36:53.128 --> 36:54.129
No!

36:59.885 --> 37:01.053
Shit.

37:02.429 --> 37:04.473
Team three, break position.

37:05.599 --> 37:06.850
I need you on-site now.

38:32.102 --> 38:33.562
<i>Glide two seven, understood.</i>

38:43.682 --> 38:44.975
Shit.

38:57.294 --> 38:58.462
Move!

39:03.133 --> 39:04.259
Shit.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.971
I want his phone back on the grid now.

39:08.597 --> 39:09.640
Hey!

39:40.504 --> 39:41.588
Move!

40:18.834 --> 40:20.294
<i>Hello?</i>

40:20.377 --> 40:21.545
<i>Hello?</i>

40:21.628 --> 40:22.671
Hello.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.047
<i>It's Hammond.</i>

40:24.131 --> 40:25.132
I don't know any Hammond.

40:25.215 --> 40:26.216
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

40:26.341 --> 40:27.426
<i>You said this might happen.</i>

40:27.509 --> 40:29.928
<i>Look, find a piece of glass.</i>

40:30.012 --> 40:31.555
<i>Put your hand to it.</i>

40:31.638 --> 40:32.973
<i>Do it now.</i>

40:41.857 --> 40:42.858
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

40:44.026 --> 40:45.652
<i>They really did
a number on you, didn't they?</i>

40:45.736 --> 40:46.862
Who the hell are you?

40:47.237 --> 40:49.615
<i>You honestly don't remember
any of it, do you?</i>

40:50.032 --> 40:51.158
No. No, I don't.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.493
Remember what? How do you know me?

40:52.576 --> 40:54.745
<i>We worked at federal intel together.</i>

40:55.037 --> 40:57.164
<i>Look, there isn't much time.</i>

40:57.247 --> 40:59.249
<i>You said to me
that if you ever pop back on the grid,</i>

40:59.374 --> 41:00.459
<i>I was to phone this number.</i>

41:00.542 --> 41:01.835
The grid?

41:02.044 --> 41:03.420
<i>Your phone.</i>

41:03.504 --> 41:05.380
<i>It's been reactivated.</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:07.925
<i>How do you think
they've been tracking you?</i>

41:08.008 --> 41:09.551
<i>Look, you asked me to give you a message,</i>

41:09.635 --> 41:11.720
<i>so I'm giving it to you. Get the key.</i>

41:12.471 --> 41:13.889
The key? What is the key?

41:13.972 --> 41:15.182
<i>You said you'd know.</i>

41:15.265 --> 41:17.309
Yeah, well, I don't! So tell me what it is.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.853
<i>Look, I know we were close,</i>

41:19.937 --> 41:21.522
<i>but this is getting too dangerous.</i>

41:21.605 --> 41:23.565
<i>If they find out I've
contacted you, I'll be...</i>

41:23.649 --> 41:26.818
Just... Just tell me what's going on.

41:26.902 --> 41:28.195
All right, who is it you think I am?

41:29.112 --> 41:30.113
<i>Henry.</i>

41:30.531 --> 41:32.741
Henry, okay, good. Henry, who?

41:32.908 --> 41:34.701
<i>Look, there isn't any time.</i>

41:34.785 --> 41:36.828
<i>If I were you, I'd get rid of that phone.</i>

41:36.912 --> 41:38.830
<i>- All right? Now.</i>
- How can I get rid of the phone?

41:38.914 --> 41:40.249
It's in my goddamn hand. How am I...

41:40.332 --> 41:41.667
Hey, wait.

41:53.011 --> 41:55.514
10549. 10549.

42:12.698 --> 42:13.865
Come on.

42:29.631 --> 42:31.174
Holy shit.

42:32.009 --> 42:33.385
What is that?

42:33.468 --> 42:34.511
Where can I get one?

42:45.647 --> 42:47.274
- What the hell?
- Yo, come on.

42:57.284 --> 42:58.952
Hey, Robo-dick, that's mine!

43:03.165 --> 43:05.167
<i>Going somewhere? No?</i>

43:05.250 --> 43:06.835
<i>Well, don't let that stop you.</i>

43:06.918 --> 43:09.713
<i>That fantasy that remains
forever out of reach?</i>

43:09.796 --> 43:11.006
<i>Not any more.</i>

43:11.740 --> 43:15.785
<i>At Rekall, we'll provide you with
a complete set of memories all your own.</i>

43:17.328 --> 43:18.538
<i>Rekall.</i>

43:19.080 --> 43:21.207
<i>We can remember it for you.</i>

43:22.893 --> 43:24.311
Come inside! We have hot food for you.

43:31.401 --> 43:33.111
Quaid must've known we'd be tracking it.

43:34.446 --> 43:37.074
How the hell would he have known that?

43:41.370 --> 43:43.163
Oh, shit.

43:48.085 --> 43:49.795
<i>He made you look like a fool.</i>

43:49.878 --> 43:51.671
He'd had major tactical training, sir.

43:51.755 --> 43:52.839
I wasn't made aware of that.

43:53.382 --> 43:55.300
<i>How the hell did he get activated?</i>

43:55.550 --> 43:58.428
An agent in place
told me he'd gone to Rekall.

43:58.512 --> 44:01.598
I sent a team in, but his memory implant had
been blown before they could get to him.

44:02.015 --> 44:03.350
I'm 15 minutes behind him.

44:03.433 --> 44:05.352
<i>Neutralize only, do you understand me?</i>

44:05.894 --> 44:07.062
<i>No lethal force.</i>

44:07.312 --> 44:09.564
<i>I want him alive for re-implantation.</i>

44:11.483 --> 44:12.901
Who the hell is this guy, sir?

44:15.320 --> 44:16.655
<i>Take me off display.</i>

44:24.329 --> 44:25.831
Line is secure.

44:29.960 --> 44:32.003
Are you fucking kidding me?

44:33.088 --> 44:34.297
Why is he still alive?

44:38.844 --> 44:40.095
Yes, sir.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.020
- We kill him on sight.
- But the Chancellor said...

44:49.104 --> 44:50.897
I'm sorry, say again?

44:51.857 --> 44:53.233
- Sorry.
- The Chancellor's not here

44:53.316 --> 44:54.818
on the ground.

44:54.943 --> 44:57.696
Believe me, if that target's given
even half a chance, he will end us.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.866
If you see him, you shoot to kill.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.450
- Is that understood?
- Will you lay off, asshole?

45:02.742 --> 45:04.786
I keep telling you, that's my phone.

45:04.870 --> 45:06.288
The guy gave it to me, I swear.

45:06.371 --> 45:07.372
Where was he going?

45:08.623 --> 45:09.624
Who?

45:09.708 --> 45:11.042
The man that gave it to you.

45:11.126 --> 45:13.837
Lady, do I look like a psychic?
How the hell do I know?

45:13.920 --> 45:17.257
All I'm saying is that phone
is my personal property now, okay?

45:17.340 --> 45:18.717
I know my rights, so you all can just...

45:20.010 --> 45:21.219
Hey!

45:25.807 --> 45:27.058
When you've got your breath back,

45:27.809 --> 45:29.144
you're going to tell me everything

45:29.227 --> 45:30.979
that man said to you,
starting from the beginning.

45:31.479 --> 45:32.731
Who are you?

45:33.982 --> 45:35.442
I'm his wife.

45:43.909 --> 45:45.619
Okay. You're good.

45:48.830 --> 45:50.498
Can I help you, sir?

45:50.582 --> 45:52.876
Yeah, I have a safety-deposit box here.

45:52.959 --> 45:55.879
It's 10549.

46:07.182 --> 46:08.266
Okay.

46:08.516 --> 46:09.684
This way, please.

46:21.363 --> 46:24.824
Just need a signature match.

46:26.326 --> 46:28.203
- Signature match?
- For the account.

46:34.376 --> 46:36.544
Is there a problem, Mr. Reed?

46:38.046 --> 46:39.381
No. No problem.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.686
You can use any one of these client rooms.

46:52.769 --> 46:54.229
And I'll just be outside, if you need me.

46:54.312 --> 46:55.522
Thanks.

48:22.817 --> 48:23.818
<i>Okay.</i>

<i>Okay, you're going to
find this hard to believe,</i>

48:36.581 --> 48:37.999
<i>but this is not your face.</i>

48:38.875 --> 48:41.294

48:44.506 --> 48:47.717
<i>If you're watching this,
it means I failed to escape.</i>

48:47.801 --> 48:49.844
<i>It means, it means they
succeeded in giving you</i>

48:50.220 --> 48:52.555

53:25.703 --> 53:27.914
<i>on the suspect traveling north
on Interstate 19.</i>

53:36.339 --> 53:37.590
Oh, shit.

53:37.715 --> 53:38.841
Lori.

53:39.008 --> 53:40.051
Who?

53:40.301 --> 53:41.761
It's my wife.

53:42.428 --> 53:43.554
You're married?

53:43.763 --> 53:45.390
It's safe to say we're separated.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.025
Here, you drive!

55:19.843 --> 55:21.845
<i>Suspect is headed to
suspension level three.</i>

55:21.928 --> 55:24.222
<i>Repeat, he has headed to suspension three.</i>

55:50.040 --> 55:53.001
AV-81,
he's headed eastbound on Wellington.

55:53.085 --> 55:54.795
I want you there before he is, do you copy?

55:55.504 --> 55:56.588
<i>Copy that, 905.</i>

55:56.671 --> 55:59.007
<i>All vehicle and air support,
proceed to Wellington.</i>

56:00.550 --> 56:03.261
<i>Establish a barricade in zone 217.</i>

56:15.232 --> 56:18.026
Central, I want all units
to maintain their perimeter.

56:18.110 --> 56:19.820
Drive him into that barricade.

56:22.781 --> 56:24.282
Do not allow him any room for evasion.

56:24.366 --> 56:25.367
Is that clear?

56:25.450 --> 56:26.576
<i>Copy that, 905.</i>

56:26.660 --> 56:28.870
<i>All vehicles, hold position.</i>

56:29.329 --> 56:30.539
Oh, shit.

56:32.207 --> 56:33.208
Shit.

56:33.291 --> 56:35.001
<i>Warning, mag suspension cannot be</i>

56:35.419 --> 56:37.129
<i>disengaged while vehicle is in operation.</i>

56:39.005 --> 56:40.090
What the hell are you doing?

56:40.173 --> 56:41.800
You're gonna need your seat belt on!

56:43.552 --> 56:47.013
<i>Warning, mag suspension cannot be
disengaged while vehicle is in...</i>

56:50.809 --> 56:52.102
<i>They've got a lock on the vehicle.</i>

56:52.185 --> 56:53.562
<i>Are they clear to engage?</i>

56:53.645 --> 56:54.855
You are clear to engage.

56:55.147 --> 56:56.398
- Got it?
- No, no!

56:56.481 --> 56:57.607
- You got it?
- Yes!

57:05.157 --> 57:06.199
Shit!

57:15.584 --> 57:17.752
<i>Welcome. Operating systems activated.</i>

58:22.692 --> 58:26.112
<i>Welcome home Mr. Reed.
Did you have a nice day?</i>

58:26.237 --> 58:27.739
Great, thanks.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.119
The key, the key, the key.

01:02:22.865 --> 01:02:24.408
<i>This message is being recorded</i>

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:27.077
<i>in the event of a worst-case scenario.</i>

01:02:27.578 --> 01:02:30.539
<i>I'm sure you're desperate for answers,</i>
<i>so I 'II just start from the top.</i>

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.417
<i>My name...</i>

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:40.424
<i>Your name is Carl Hauser.</i>

01:02:41.842 --> 01:02:43.093
Oh, shit.

01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:46.972
<i>This recording has limited
interactive capabilities.</i>

01:02:47.056 --> 01:02:48.807
<i>So, just try rephrasing the question.</i>

01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:51.226
You work with Matthias.

01:02:52.019 --> 01:02:53.062
<i>Yes and no.</i>

01:02:53.187 --> 01:02:56.148
<i>I've never actually met the man.</i>

01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:57.900
<i>Hardly anyone has.</i>

01:02:58.359 --> 01:03:01.028
<i>Look, I know that this is complicated.</i>

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.863
- Complicated?
<i>- But this is the truth.</i>

01:03:03.558 --> 01:03:06.519
<i>I am a Federal Intelligence operative</i>

01:03:06.811 --> 01:03:08.438
<i>assigned by Cohaagen</i>

01:03:08.772 --> 01:03:12.525
<i>to infiltrate the Resistance
and assassinate Matthias.</i>

01:03:13.443 --> 01:03:14.694
<i>But instead,</i>

01:03:17.113 --> 01:03:19.449
<i>I discovered
I was fighting for the wrong side.</i>

01:03:20.784 --> 01:03:22.744
<i>I met a woman.</i>

01:03:22.827 --> 01:03:24.370
<i>She works with the Resistance.</i>

01:03:24.454 --> 01:03:26.498
<i>And she showed me
that they were worth fighting for.</i>

01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:28.666
You mean the terrorists.

01:03:29.250 --> 01:03:32.879
<i>Listen, the Resistance are not terrorists.</i>

01:03:33.296 --> 01:03:34.297
<i>All right.</i>

01:03:34.422 --> 01:03:37.300
<i>Matthias' targets are always
military installations.</i>

01:03:37.425 --> 01:03:38.635
<i>If there's anything else happening,</i>

01:03:38.927 --> 01:03:41.012
<i>you can be sure it's Cohaagen himself.</i>

01:03:41.137 --> 01:03:42.847
<i>Trust me, all right.</i>

01:03:42.931 --> 01:03:45.475
<i>The Chancellor and I go way back.</i>

01:03:45.642 --> 01:03:48.019
<i>He was my commanding officer in the war.</i>

01:03:48.144 --> 01:03:50.480
<i>I know exactly what he is capable of.</i>

01:03:50.688 --> 01:03:52.982
Why would he attack his own people?
I don't understand.

01:03:53.066 --> 01:03:58.446
<i>How else could he justify tripling
production of federal police synthetics?</i>

01:03:59.155 --> 01:04:03.243
<i>He is building a private army
capable of invading The Colony.</i>

01:04:03.993 --> 01:04:04.994
<i>Think about it. All right.</i>

01:04:05.078 --> 01:04:08.957
<i>What is the one resource The Colony has
that United Britain doesn't?</i>

01:04:09.499 --> 01:04:11.793
- Space.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:13.545
He's run out of room.

01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:16.297
<i>But even Cohaagen himself
is gonna have a difficult time</i>

01:04:16.381 --> 01:04:20.176
<i>selling the forced seizure
and mass displacement of billions.</i>

01:04:20.385 --> 01:04:23.179
<i>So, he created an enemy in Matthias,</i>

01:04:23.596 --> 01:04:25.515
<i>and he built an army to fight him.</i>

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.226
<i>And now it is up to me to stop him.</i>

01:04:28.351 --> 01:04:29.644
<i>Up to you to stop him.</i>

01:04:29.853 --> 01:04:30.854
What do you mean, me?

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.984
<i>The synthetics run on a bio-mech brainstem.</i>

01:04:36.734 --> 01:04:39.946
<i>All right. Which means, it's possible
to shut 'em all down.</i>

01:04:40.697 --> 01:04:42.615
<i>All right, there's a kill code.</i>

01:04:42.699 --> 01:04:44.200
<i>It's a complex sequence,</i>

01:04:44.367 --> 01:04:46.536
<i>but it's in my head, it's in your head.</i>

01:04:47.287 --> 01:04:49.122
Sorry, come again.

01:04:49.205 --> 01:04:51.958
<i>I went back to U. F.B. territory</i>

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:54.043
<i>to try and retrieve the code,</i>

01:04:54.711 --> 01:04:57.964
<i>knowing full well that if Cohaagen
found out I'd turned,</i>

01:04:58.590 --> 01:04:59.799
<i>he'd erase my memory.</i>

01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:04.220
<i>But what he didn't know was that
I arranged to have a black box</i>

01:05:04.345 --> 01:05:06.598
<i>imbedded in my brain, in your brain.</i>

01:05:07.098 --> 01:05:08.975
<i>It recorded everything I saw.</i>

01:05:09.058 --> 01:05:11.436
So, you're saying
there's a little safe in my skull.

01:05:12.103 --> 01:05:13.396
<i>Yes.</i>

01:05:13.563 --> 01:05:15.148
<i>And that is why I need you.</i>

01:05:15.398 --> 01:05:19.193
<i>The world needs you,
to reconnect with the Resistance.</i>

01:05:19.569 --> 01:05:21.529
<i>Deliver the code to Matthias,</i>

01:05:21.613 --> 01:05:26.200
<i>have him shut down the synthetics
and stop Cohaagen while there's still time.</i>

01:05:28.202 --> 01:05:31.080
<i>The future hangs on what you...</i>

01:05:31.998 --> 01:05:33.249
<i>On what we do next.</i>

01:05:35.251 --> 01:05:36.669
<i>Good luck, buddy.</i>

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:43.301
You have got to be kidding me.

01:05:43.635 --> 01:05:45.261
This can't be happening.

01:05:45.345 --> 01:05:46.846
Shouldn't have come here.

01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:52.769
Yeah, I know.

01:05:53.728 --> 01:05:55.313
I had no choice.

01:05:56.147 --> 01:05:57.690
I know that this is a lot to take.

01:05:58.705 --> 01:06:00.707
Yeah, it's a lot to take.

01:06:02.042 --> 01:06:03.210
Yeah, I'm supposed to believe this?

01:06:04.211 --> 01:06:05.587
It's the truth.

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:08.298
Hauser, we have been looking for you.

01:06:08.549 --> 01:06:09.591
Don't call me...

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:12.302
My name is Doug Quaid.
I was born August 29th.

01:06:12.386 --> 01:06:13.637
All right, I was raised by my mother.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:15.764
She died of cancer ten days
before my 15th birthday.

01:06:15.848 --> 01:06:16.882
I married my girlfriend when I was 29!

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.725
You were born April 29th.

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:20.561
You were raised by your father,
not your mother.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:23.480
He died before you were 15,
but in a car crash.

01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:26.733
And believe me, you were
most definitely not married.

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:30.612
I'm sorry. You know what?
None of this makes any sense to me.

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:31.738
I'm Doug Quaid, that's all I know.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:33.615
You recognized me.

01:06:33.699 --> 01:06:35.158
From a dream.

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:38.203
I recognize you from a dream.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:40.581
It wasn't a dream.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:43.584
It was a memory.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:48.922
That scar on your hand,
how do you think you got it?

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:51.800
Do you know?

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.262
I got it at work.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.322
I was trying to help you escape,
but I was too late.

01:07:13.405 --> 01:07:14.656
You grabbed onto me

01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:17.701
and a bullet tore through
your hand and mine.

01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:32.966
You must remember something.

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:43.685
And you and I, we were...

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.230
Yeah.

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:51.485
We got to go. We got to go.

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:12.172
Shit. Come on, come on.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.759
Doug!

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:19.554
Harry?

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:25.602
Harry, what are you doing here?

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.522
They sent me in for you.

01:08:29.022 --> 01:08:30.189
To talk you down.

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.316
Who sent you in?

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.609
Doug,

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.697
you don't get it.
I don't mean they sent me in here.

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.366
I mean, they sent me into your mind.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.326
I need you to listen to me.

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:44.453
You're suffering what's called
a paranoid dissociative break.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.915
Brought on by the trauma
of a chemical fantasy.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:48.959
What are you talking about?

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.211
You're not really here, Doug.

01:08:51.712 --> 01:08:54.089
You're still back at Rekall,
strapped to a chair.

01:08:54.423 --> 01:08:55.674
None of this is real.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:56.883
Back at Rekall?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.094
He's lying.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:00.178
He's lying!

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:03.140
Just slow down.

01:09:03.223 --> 01:09:04.224
Harry, what are you talking about?

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.102
When we were back at the bar,
you had me worried. So, I followed you.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.979
And by the time I got
here, it was too late.

01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:11.857
You were unresponsive.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:16.194
So they chemically
transfused me into your mind.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.073
They thought a familiar face might
help, to try and bring you back

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.908
before it's too late

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.577
and you're trapped here forever.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.412
Do not listen to them. They're just trying
to recover what's in your head.

01:09:28.081 --> 01:09:30.375
Doug, I assure you.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:32.002
This is not the Harry that you know.

01:09:32.961 --> 01:09:33.962
Think...

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.673
Does he even sound like himself?

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:40.385
He is a plant, just like your wife,
to keep you in line.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.389
I don't sound like me, Doug,
because you don't want me to.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.142
What do you mean, "I don't want you to"?

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.603
You need to realize,
I'm merely the idea of Harry.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:51.813
The rest is supplied
by your own imagination.

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:54.357
Even the explanation
I'm giving you right now.

01:09:55.275 --> 01:09:57.652
It's really you. It's really you.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.489
Your mind is choosing the words.

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:04.701
Because that's where we are, Doug.
In your mind.

01:10:06.745 --> 01:10:10.999
We must get you out before it's too late,
and you're trapped here forever.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:14.836
If this is all in my mind,

01:10:16.755 --> 01:10:17.816
why are you wearing a bulletproof vest?

01:10:18.507 --> 01:10:19.966
Because you put it on me.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.259
- I put it on you?
- Don't you see?

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:22.761
Explain that to me, how
do I put this on you?

01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:23.929
He's crazy.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:25.806
Part of you wants to protect me.

01:10:26.098 --> 01:10:28.183
To let me guide you back to consciousness

01:10:28.809 --> 01:10:31.853
before your psychosis
reaches such extreme levels

01:10:32.395 --> 01:10:34.106
that you slip into a permanent coma.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.026
To convince you to free yourself.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.569
Hauser...

01:10:40.821 --> 01:10:42.989
I am real. He is real.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:44.825
He works for Cohaagen.

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:48.620
Lori?

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:56.253
- What's she doing here?
- She's here, too, Doug.

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:57.420
What's she doing here?

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:00.257
She's in the room, beside you,

01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:01.758
holding your hand right now,

01:11:01.842 --> 01:11:03.009
worried sick.

01:11:03.218 --> 01:11:04.803
It's her presence you're sensing.

01:11:04.886 --> 01:11:06.972
She's... She's trying to kill me!

01:11:07.055 --> 01:11:08.098
- No.
- Harry!

01:11:08.181 --> 01:11:09.432
Not the real Lori, Doug.

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.853
As soon as I told her what was happening at
Rekall, she came straight over.

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.063
I had to call her at work.

01:11:15.147 --> 01:11:16.189
She loves you, Doug.

01:11:19.109 --> 01:11:22.154
Lori didn't work last night, Harry.

01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:26.825
You're lying. You're lying.

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:28.118
Why are you lying to me?

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.870
Only because you wanted me to.

01:11:31.663 --> 01:11:33.623
You're clinging to the delusion.

01:11:33.874 --> 01:11:34.875
He's lying!

01:11:38.336 --> 01:11:39.462
Harry?

01:11:39.546 --> 01:11:40.714
Harry.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:43.717
<i>I swear to God, put it down.</i>

01:11:44.259 --> 01:11:46.344
Harry, what are you doing?

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:47.804
Harry, what are you doing?

01:11:47.888 --> 01:11:49.222
This is not a delusion!

01:11:51.349 --> 01:11:52.350
No?

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.228
Okay, fine.

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:56.521
Tell you what.

01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:12.787
Is that proof enough for you?

01:12:13.163 --> 01:12:15.165
Would I have done that
if this were for real?

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.835
You see, I'm not afraid, Doug.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:21.213
You shouldn't be either.

01:12:23.465 --> 01:12:26.676
That's enough of this bullshit.
Now, you are gonna tell him the truth,

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.762
or I swear to God I'm gonna kill you.

01:12:29.221 --> 01:12:31.598
Don't... Don't.

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:33.600
Hauser...

01:12:34.267 --> 01:12:37.520
He's trying to manipulate you
into giving yourself up!

01:12:38.104 --> 01:12:40.732
- We got to get out of here.
- And go where?

01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:43.860
There's no getting
out of your own head, Doug.

01:12:43.944 --> 01:12:47.405
But you can escape this nightmare
if you let me help you.

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.324
Help me how?

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.284
- Don't listen to him.
- How can you help me?

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:52.452
Don't listen to him.

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:56.122
You have to shoot her, Doug.

01:12:57.958 --> 01:12:59.084
What, now?

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:00.794
I know that's asking a lot,

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:05.465
but she's at the epicenter of this whole

01:13:05.548 --> 01:13:06.758
twisted fantasy of yours.

01:13:07.968 --> 01:13:11.805
She represents all your frustration,
all your unhappiness.

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:13.265
- Hauser...
- Which is why

01:13:13.348 --> 01:13:14.849
it would mean nothing
if we were to kill her.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.727
It's you who has to choose reality.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.397
You shoot her, Doug, and I promise you,

01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:23.942
you will gasp awake
and find me sitting in the room beside you.

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.026
The real me.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:27.279
- No.
- Your old pal, Harry.

01:13:27.362 --> 01:13:28.363
Look at me.

01:13:29.114 --> 01:13:31.658
Turn, and you'll see your beautiful,

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:33.034
loving wife.

01:13:33.994 --> 01:13:35.161
She wants you back, Doug.

01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:37.664
We both do.

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.833
That's right, Doug.

01:13:40.292 --> 01:13:41.835
Come on back.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.798
Come on back, Doug.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.638
I can't let them take you away.

01:13:53.972 --> 01:13:56.141
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:10.071
Of course she can't do it.

01:14:10.155 --> 01:14:11.281
She's not real.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:15.368
Now you just need to prove it to yourself.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:16.661
End her, Doug.

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:19.039
End this nightmare.

01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:22.125
Shoot her!

01:14:22.334 --> 01:14:24.002
Kill her, damn it!

01:14:27.047 --> 01:14:28.048
Shoot!

01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:56.576
Jesus Christ.

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:58.661
God damn it, Harry!

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.292
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:06.836
Come on.

01:15:19.265 --> 01:15:21.267
You still out there, baby?

01:15:26.064 --> 01:15:28.233
Or I suppose I should
be calling you Hauser.

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:30.610
I guess the joke's on me.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.029
I really thought you were a loser.

01:15:34.447 --> 01:15:38.201
Turns out, I was living with
the greatest intelligence agent alive.

01:15:39.953 --> 01:15:42.872
Cohaagen still wants you back, you know.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:44.791
Guess he still has faith in you.

01:15:46.626 --> 01:15:49.129
But then you always were the favorite.

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:53.007
But I know what you are.

01:15:53.091 --> 01:15:54.592
You're a traitor, Hauser.

01:15:55.552 --> 01:15:56.636
And traitors get put to death!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.763
Come on, come on, come on.

01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:05.854
So you might want to give
your little girlfriend a kiss good-bye.

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:09.482
Long as she doesn't mind
where those lips have been.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:21.202
Oh, that's it, I'm ending this bitch.

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.833
Shit, I'm out.

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:36.843
Come on! Come on!

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.094
Go!

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.144
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.478
Come on.

01:16:54.569 --> 01:16:55.570
Shit.

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:56.946
Go!

01:17:15.465 --> 01:17:16.507
There.

01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:17.592
Oh, shit.

01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:24.265
Come on.

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:31.189
Give me the gun.

01:17:42.242 --> 01:17:43.284
Track him.

01:17:48.331 --> 01:17:49.540
Grab my arm!

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:21.114
Is this going down?

01:18:23.157 --> 01:18:24.242
No?

01:18:24.409 --> 01:18:26.244
<i>Level D-14.</i>

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:57.168
Shit.

01:19:57.319 --> 01:19:57.519
Shit.

01:20:09.789 --> 01:20:11.041
Come on. Come on.

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:13.460
Wait, wait.

01:20:13.543 --> 01:20:14.628
Go!

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:51.347
You really know how to pick 'em.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:58.604
Come on.

01:21:15.997 --> 01:21:19.167
<i>Sources close to the Chancellor
will neither confirm nor deny...</i>

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:23.921
<i>Passage on The Fall requires
a current transit visa.</i>

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:28.467
<i>If you do not have a current transit visa,
please visit the information office.</i>

01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:41.731
<i>The largest real estate agency
has now opened. Be sure to visit...</i>

01:21:41.814 --> 01:21:45.526
<i>The Resistance leader has been
in hiding for over six months.</i>

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:47.528
<i>In the wake of these latest attacks,</i>

01:21:47.612 --> 01:21:50.448
<i>federal police have
uncovered alarming new evidence</i>

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:53.284
<i>proving what many
in the Cohaagen administration have</i>

01:21:53.367 --> 01:21:56.495
<i>long suspected, that Matthias
and his terrorist movement</i>

01:21:56.579 --> 01:22:01.000
<i>are being funded by The Colony's governor
and his district's organization.</i>

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:04.962
<i>And we're now hearing unconfirmed reports
of military mobilization.</i>

01:22:05.046 --> 01:22:06.923
<i>Sources close to the
Chancellor will neither</i>

01:22:07.006 --> 01:22:08.591
<i>confirm nor deny the reports.</i>
- Jesus.

01:22:08.674 --> 01:22:10.301
<i>The Resistance leader has been...</i>

01:22:10.384 --> 01:22:11.969
We've got to get you to Matthias.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:13.679
How the hell do we find him?

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:15.389
There's a way. Come on.

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:54.053
Who is he?

01:23:01.852 --> 01:23:02.853
It's Hauser.

01:23:11.696 --> 01:23:12.863
Unbelievable.

01:23:20.288 --> 01:23:21.414
Welcome home.

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:22.999
Yeah.

01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.504
- We'll let your father know you're here.
- Thank you.

01:23:38.097 --> 01:23:39.598
So, Matthias is your father?

01:23:41.726 --> 01:23:43.769
Of course you don't remember that.
Yes, he is.

01:23:46.439 --> 01:23:47.440
That's good to know.

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.326
<i>Airlock sealed.</i>

01:24:03.581 --> 01:24:05.041
Cohaagen scours U.F.B.

01:24:05.124 --> 01:24:07.126
and The Colony every day
looking for my father.

01:24:09.295 --> 01:24:11.130
The reason they can't
find him is he's not there.

01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:14.925
After the wars,

01:24:15.009 --> 01:24:17.303
no one would be crazy
enough to come out here.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.221
Everyone stays out of the No Zone.

01:24:20.473 --> 01:24:21.849
Makes sense.

01:24:40.326 --> 01:24:42.578
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:43.746
Almost there.

01:24:48.626 --> 01:24:50.336
You okay?

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.006
Yeah, I'm...

01:24:56.675 --> 01:25:00.096
Everyone seems to know me, but me.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:02.973
It's strange.

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:05.851
Yeah.

01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:09.397
I can see he meant a lot to these guys.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.483
Yeah.

01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:14.693
He gave us the upper hand.

01:25:16.404 --> 01:25:20.032
And some of us were really
able to see the best in him.

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:22.618
What if the best is gone?

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:28.082
I'm sorry.

01:25:30.209 --> 01:25:32.002
Hauser wasn't perfect, you know.

01:25:32.086 --> 01:25:34.713
Could be a real asshole sometimes.

01:25:37.216 --> 01:25:39.093
You're just trying to make me feel better.

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:41.512
Maybe.

01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:44.265
It's working.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:44.950
Clear.

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.802
He wants to see him alone.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:15.383
Don't go too far.

01:27:16.593 --> 01:27:17.719
Okay.

01:27:40.908 --> 01:27:42.076
Mr. Hauser.

01:27:48.166 --> 01:27:49.626
What is it you want?

01:27:51.252 --> 01:27:52.754
I want to help you.

01:27:55.715 --> 01:27:58.384
That is not the only reason you're here.

01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:04.932
I want to remember.

01:28:06.476 --> 01:28:07.685
Why?

01:28:07.769 --> 01:28:10.772
So I can be myself, be who I was.

01:28:12.106 --> 01:28:16.110
It is each man's quest
to find out who he truly is,

01:28:16.194 --> 01:28:18.696
but the answer to that lies

01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:21.199
in the present, not in the past.

01:28:21.282 --> 01:28:22.784
As it is for all of us.

01:28:22.867 --> 01:28:25.536
But the past tells us who we've become.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:28.873
The past is a construct of the mind.

01:28:29.957 --> 01:28:31.376
It blinds us.

01:28:31.459 --> 01:28:33.670
It fools us into believing it.

01:28:34.128 --> 01:28:35.213
But the heart

01:28:35.296 --> 01:28:38.132
wants to live in the present.

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.635
Look there.

01:28:41.969 --> 01:28:43.471
You'll find your answer.

01:28:48.685 --> 01:28:52.146
I am told you have information
that may save us all.

01:28:53.898 --> 01:28:55.650
I am told the same.

01:29:26.305 --> 01:29:29.683
The firewall to the black box.

01:29:30.517 --> 01:29:31.810
We're in.

01:29:43.488 --> 01:29:44.573
There.

01:29:44.656 --> 01:29:45.824
You see?

01:29:45.908 --> 01:29:47.075
Jesus.

01:29:48.493 --> 01:29:50.245
Can you retrieve it?

01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:52.956
It's encrypted.

01:29:58.295 --> 01:29:59.504
What is this?

01:30:12.351 --> 01:30:13.477
<i>Hello, Matthias.</i>

01:30:14.227 --> 01:30:15.687
<i>You can't imagine how much</i>

01:30:15.771 --> 01:30:17.689
<i>I've been looking forward</i>
<i>to seeing you again.</i>

01:30:18.565 --> 01:30:20.525
<i>It's been far too long.</i>

01:30:20.609 --> 01:30:23.403
<i>You know, you're a very hard man to find.</i>

01:30:23.487 --> 01:30:25.697
- It's a trap.
- Shut it all down!

01:30:27.699 --> 01:30:29.284
Secure all entrances!

01:30:30.827 --> 01:30:31.870
Move! Move!

01:30:37.042 --> 01:30:38.085
Go, go, go!

01:31:00.232 --> 01:31:01.733
Get him out of here!

01:31:06.905 --> 01:31:08.240
Gun down now!

01:31:10.575 --> 01:31:11.994
Now!

01:31:38.895 --> 01:31:40.105
Well done.

01:31:42.941 --> 01:31:44.109
It's impressive.

01:31:46.445 --> 01:31:48.780
You'll be interested to know that

01:31:49.281 --> 01:31:50.824
there is no kill code.

01:31:52.784 --> 01:31:53.785
It was a fake.

01:31:53.869 --> 01:31:55.120
You're lying.

01:31:56.705 --> 01:31:57.789
Sorry.

01:31:58.707 --> 01:32:00.709
It was the only way to get to you.

01:32:00.792 --> 01:32:03.045
All this trouble for one man.

01:32:03.962 --> 01:32:06.465
Oh, never underestimate
the power of one man.

01:32:07.424 --> 01:32:08.467
I know I don't.

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:12.763
Father!

01:32:14.014 --> 01:32:15.474
No! No!

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.730
We knew this day would come.

01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:24.941
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:32:37.871 --> 01:32:38.872
No. Melina!

01:32:43.251 --> 01:32:45.087
- Lieutenant?
- It's all here, sir.

01:32:45.545 --> 01:32:46.755
Matthias' defensive plans,

01:32:46.838 --> 01:32:49.299
troop numbers and location coordinates

01:32:49.382 --> 01:32:52.135
on every Resistance outpost in The Colony.

01:32:52.219 --> 01:32:54.846
The first wave of attack
is already underway.

01:32:58.433 --> 01:32:59.768
Brilliant.

01:33:00.602 --> 01:33:02.938
Congratulations, my friend.
Get him up, please.

01:33:03.897 --> 01:33:05.190
Up, up, up.

01:33:06.358 --> 01:33:07.359
You did it.

01:33:11.446 --> 01:33:12.614
You're a hero.

01:33:16.201 --> 01:33:18.120
What is that? Modesty? No, no, no.

01:33:18.245 --> 01:33:19.579
Matthias is dead,

01:33:19.663 --> 01:33:21.790
The Colony is about to fall,

01:33:21.873 --> 01:33:23.375
and it's all thanks to you.

01:33:23.542 --> 01:33:26.670
I knew that I could trust you
to stick to the plan.

01:33:27.045 --> 01:33:28.380
What are you talking about?

01:33:29.631 --> 01:33:32.676
Right. Yours is not
the most reliable of memories, is it?

01:33:33.552 --> 01:33:36.054
It was really rather simple.

01:33:37.222 --> 01:33:41.143
Infiltrate the resistance,
find Matthias' daughter.

01:33:41.226 --> 01:33:43.520
- No. No.
- Get her to trust you. Yes.

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:47.691
That's right.

01:33:48.567 --> 01:33:50.902
Once we discovered he was your father,

01:33:51.778 --> 01:33:53.738
we knew exactly who to target.

01:33:53.905 --> 01:33:55.282
Melina, he's lying.

01:33:55.657 --> 01:33:58.451
I'm afraid not.
You see, that was also the easy part.

01:33:58.743 --> 01:34:02.622
Because seduction has always been
his strongest suit.

01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:07.502
Still, it was Matthias
that we needed to get to.

01:34:09.087 --> 01:34:11.673
He would need assurance
far beyond mere words

01:34:12.465 --> 01:34:16.595
to let a man with your
history, shall I say,

01:34:17.053 --> 01:34:18.430
come anywhere near him.

01:34:20.932 --> 01:34:25.562
But that is when you came up
with the ingenious idea

01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:30.275
to feign capture
and let us wipe your slate clean.

01:34:30.442 --> 01:34:31.484
Don't listen to him.

01:34:34.112 --> 01:34:36.907
It was just brilliant.

01:34:38.617 --> 01:34:41.244
What better way

01:34:41.411 --> 01:34:43.580
to convince the old man that you

01:34:44.414 --> 01:34:48.084
had really and truly turned against me.

01:34:48.168 --> 01:34:50.545
Melina, don't listen to him.
Don't listen to him.

01:34:50.670 --> 01:34:54.507
- He's lying.
- No, I'm not.

01:34:56.718 --> 01:34:57.969
Granted, there were a few hiccups

01:34:58.094 --> 01:35:00.388
along the way... You popping

01:35:00.472 --> 01:35:02.766
your cap at Rekall, for instance.

01:35:02.849 --> 01:35:04.559
That wasn't good.

01:35:06.478 --> 01:35:07.479
There it is!

01:35:09.147 --> 01:35:11.316
The old Hauser spirit.
You're gonna need that.

01:35:13.318 --> 01:35:14.986
And then there was your lovely wife,

01:35:15.987 --> 01:35:17.822
who strayed from her directive.

01:35:17.906 --> 01:35:19.157
Look at me.

01:35:19.241 --> 01:35:21.493
She was ordered to bring you back alive.

01:35:24.371 --> 01:35:25.872
I'll deal with that later.

01:35:29.167 --> 01:35:31.002
But,

01:35:31.336 --> 01:35:33.338
you led us here, Hauser.

01:35:34.089 --> 01:35:35.757
You held up your part of the deal,

01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.259
and now I'm going to hold up mine.

01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:39.844
What do you mean?

01:35:45.058 --> 01:35:46.601
- No.
- What are you doing?

01:35:46.685 --> 01:35:48.687
What are you...

01:35:51.773 --> 01:35:53.066
What are you doing?

01:35:54.943 --> 01:35:56.736
What you and I had been planning all along.

01:35:58.697 --> 01:36:00.782
We made sure to back up Hauser's memory

01:36:00.865 --> 01:36:02.617
before we sent him in there.

01:36:07.747 --> 01:36:09.082
This is what you wanted.

01:36:09.207 --> 01:36:10.542
- No.
- Yes.

01:36:11.668 --> 01:36:13.586
Just think of it. In a few hours,

01:36:13.670 --> 01:36:15.755
you'll awake,

01:36:15.839 --> 01:36:18.508
and you will be the old Hauser once again.

01:36:18.591 --> 01:36:19.843
Loyal.

01:36:20.719 --> 01:36:22.220
Patriotic.

01:36:23.263 --> 01:36:24.556
Ruthless.

01:36:27.559 --> 01:36:29.060
Now, what to do with you?

01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:32.147
I think we keep her.

01:36:32.230 --> 01:36:34.607
Leave her out of this.
I'm in the fucking chair!

01:36:34.774 --> 01:36:36.609
I think the world will be very interested

01:36:36.693 --> 01:36:37.986
to hear the confession

01:36:38.069 --> 01:36:40.280
of Matthias' daughter.

01:36:40.447 --> 01:36:42.741
Denouncing her father and the Resistance.

01:36:45.368 --> 01:36:46.578
Fuck you!

01:36:50.582 --> 01:36:51.624
Cohaagen!

01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:57.922
You'll be very surprised
to see how good Hauser is at beating

01:36:58.006 --> 01:36:59.257
a confession out of someone.

01:36:59.341 --> 01:37:00.592
God damn you, Cohaagen.

01:37:01.051 --> 01:37:02.427
You have me.

01:37:03.094 --> 01:37:04.095
Let her go.

01:37:04.637 --> 01:37:05.680
Let her go!

01:37:11.102 --> 01:37:12.312
Melina.

01:37:15.398 --> 01:37:18.109
Just try to relax.
It'll all be over soon, I promise you.

01:37:18.193 --> 01:37:20.028
We'll be reunited very soon.

01:37:21.279 --> 01:37:23.031
And meanwhile,

01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:26.034
I have an invasion to lead.

01:37:30.789 --> 01:37:32.374
I wish I could forget that easily.

01:37:33.666 --> 01:37:34.709
Lori.

01:37:36.461 --> 01:37:37.796
Sweet dreams.

01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.695
Hold him still, Hammond.

01:38:17.168 --> 01:38:18.795
Do me a favor, asshole.

01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:20.630
Fight it as much as possible.

01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:23.049
Hurts more that way.

01:39:01.713 --> 01:39:03.381
Jesus, Hammond.

01:39:04.299 --> 01:39:06.718
<i>Suspected reports of military mobilization</i>

01:39:06.801 --> 01:39:09.387
<i>in the U.F.B. have now been confirmed.</i>

01:39:09.471 --> 01:39:10.972
<i>But what was thought to be an operation</i>

01:39:11.055 --> 01:39:13.016
<i>to uproot terrorist leader Matthias</i>

01:39:13.099 --> 01:39:16.853
<i>appears to be on the scale
of a full military invasion.</i>

01:39:16.936 --> 01:39:18.855
<i>An estimated 50,000 armed troops</i>

01:39:18.938 --> 01:39:23.359
<i>can be seen boarding The Fall,
preparing to deploy for The Colony.</i>

01:39:23.443 --> 01:39:26.196
<i>The governor has issued a level-three alert</i>

01:39:26.279 --> 01:39:28.364
<i>to all districts of The Colony.</i>

01:39:54.614 --> 01:39:56.074
Have the latest mission profiles

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:58.159
been programmed into all our troops?

01:39:58.243 --> 01:40:00.495
Being distributed to
all squadron commanders as we speak.

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:01.830
Excellent. When do we depart?

01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:03.498
As soon as you give the order, sir.

01:40:04.165 --> 01:40:05.250
You have it.

01:40:05.333 --> 01:40:07.627
And find someplace for her, will you?

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:28.750
<i>Bay three access granted.</i>

01:41:34.255 --> 01:41:36.758
<i>We are a go on Code 310.</i>

01:41:36.841 --> 01:41:39.677
<i>Citizens of The Colony are
to be considered hostile.</i>

01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:42.263
<i>Program all synthetics to use lethal force.</i>

01:41:42.347 --> 01:41:46.017
<i>Repeat, citizens of The Colony
are to be considered hostile.</i>

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.144
<i>We are a go on Code 310.</i>

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:17.108
<i>Time travel to The Colony:
approximately 17 minutes.</i>

01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:43.885
<i>This is Aristotle 8. Can you give me
that rover ID again? You're breaking up.</i>

01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:45.011
<i>Was that a nine?</i>

01:44:06.950 --> 01:44:08.493
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:44:09.953 --> 01:44:11.371
We got to get off this thing.

01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:12.664
Now.

01:44:15.333 --> 01:44:17.502
Your father... I'm so sorry.

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:22.507
- All those things that Cohaagen said...
- He was lying.

01:44:22.966 --> 01:44:24.258
I couldn't have betrayed you.

01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:26.886
I told you I'd find you.

01:44:28.972 --> 01:44:31.808
<i>I remember. My whole life,</i>

01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:35.061
only one memory stayed with me.

01:44:36.521 --> 01:44:37.689
They could never erase that.

01:44:48.324 --> 01:44:50.243
<i>Damage report in bay six.</i>

01:44:50.743 --> 01:44:52.370
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:54.372
<i>All emergency personnel,</i>

01:44:54.455 --> 01:44:56.833
<i>please report to bay six.</i>

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:01.796
<i>Prepare for gravity shift.</i>

01:45:01.879 --> 01:45:03.006
Drop your weapons!

01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:04.882
Now!

01:45:05.883 --> 01:45:07.218
Right now!

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:14.017
Lieutenant, we've
secured the prisoners attempting escape

01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:15.393
on level nine.

01:45:15.727 --> 01:45:17.979
The prisoner in bay six
was just caught attempting escape.

01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:20.106
She was with a second individual, male.

01:45:20.732 --> 01:45:21.983
That's him.

01:45:22.066 --> 01:45:23.526
Deal with it.

01:45:24.569 --> 01:45:26.237
Come on.

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:30.950
And the bag.

01:45:32.577 --> 01:45:33.703
Do it.

01:45:34.746 --> 01:45:37.874
<i>Team leader two, team leader two.
Seventh level prison...</i>

01:46:25.155 --> 01:46:26.865
<i>Entering core.</i>

01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.191
It's okay.

01:46:45.274 --> 01:46:47.068
They're in stasis.

01:46:47.151 --> 01:46:48.486
Okay.

01:47:05.211 --> 01:47:06.254
Shit.

01:47:11.592 --> 01:47:14.595
<i>Attention, emergency hatch cannot deploy</i>

01:47:14.679 --> 01:47:16.347
<i>- while in zero gravity.</i>
- What are you doing?

01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:18.766
Hauser, these doors don't
open for a reason.

01:47:18.850 --> 01:47:20.268
We'll wait till it passes the core.

01:47:20.726 --> 01:47:22.103
Then we go.

01:47:25.231 --> 01:47:26.315
Shit.

01:47:26.399 --> 01:47:27.942
<i>Gravity reversing.</i>

01:47:28.025 --> 01:47:29.235
Come on.

01:47:50.798 --> 01:47:51.841
Take this.

01:47:57.096 --> 01:47:58.764
<i>Hatch deployed.</i>

01:47:58.848 --> 01:48:01.767
<i>Commencing deceleration.</i>

01:48:07.732 --> 01:48:08.983
Go!

01:48:16.991 --> 01:48:18.826
- Move!
<i>- Hatch deployed.</i>

01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:20.912
<i>Commencing deceleration.</i>

01:48:28.461 --> 01:48:29.795
They're headed topside.

01:48:30.963 --> 01:48:32.131
What?

01:48:32.215 --> 01:48:33.966
I'm going after them.

01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:35.635
<i>Lori, no.</i>

01:48:36.802 --> 01:48:39.096
If they make it up top,
I will deal with them.

01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:41.474
Just make sure those troops are activated

01:48:41.557 --> 01:48:43.351
and off-loaded the moment we arrive.

01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:46.354
<i>Hauser is not stopping this invasion.
Do you understand me?</i>

01:48:47.730 --> 01:48:48.940
Follow them.

01:49:11.170 --> 01:49:13.464
Shit. We got to get to the aircraft bay.

01:49:13.881 --> 01:49:14.966
Come on.

01:49:16.008 --> 01:49:17.051
Go.

01:49:20.388 --> 01:49:21.973
No! Hauser!

01:49:33.025 --> 01:49:34.235
Secure him!

01:49:52.795 --> 01:49:56.215
<i>Government officials have issued
a Colony-wide state of emergency.</i>

01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:58.843
<i>All civilians are to evacuate
their homes immediately</i>

01:49:58.926 --> 01:50:01.053
<i>and head to the nearest No Zone shelters</i>

01:50:01.137 --> 01:50:03.014
<i>outside The Colony border.</i>

01:50:03.097 --> 01:50:07.393
<i>Officials are urging everyone
to comply with the evacuation orders.</i>

01:50:07.476 --> 01:50:09.729
<i>Continued bombings
on Resistance holdouts...</i>

01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:26.787
<i>The Fall secured.</i>

01:50:26.871 --> 01:50:29.707
<i>Bays three through 87
now armed and active.</i>

01:50:31.250 --> 01:50:33.210
Let's get them on the move now.

01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:12.958
You really are a disappointment, Hauser.

01:51:21.759 --> 01:51:24.762
I'm afraid it's time to erase
those memories for good.

01:51:27.264 --> 01:51:28.474
Good-bye, old friend.

01:51:46.409 --> 01:51:48.702
<i>Weapon systems activated.</i>

01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:46.302
<i>Ammo chamber is empty.</i>

01:52:46.385 --> 01:52:47.470
Come on.

01:53:32.598 --> 01:53:35.184
<i>- Weapons systems reloading.</i>
- Shit, come on.

01:53:35.267 --> 01:53:37.770
You really thought
that would stop an entire invasion?

01:53:38.395 --> 01:53:40.564
No, but I think this will.

01:54:37.621 --> 01:54:38.998
Look at you.

01:54:40.249 --> 01:54:41.500
You're still fighting

01:54:41.583 --> 01:54:43.002
and you don't even know who you are.

01:54:43.836 --> 01:54:46.005
I may not remember who I was,

01:54:46.088 --> 01:54:48.132
but I know who I am.

01:55:13.324 --> 01:55:15.826
Say hello to my wife for me.

01:55:26.295 --> 01:55:28.130
Come on! Run!

01:55:54.073 --> 01:55:55.866
Come on. Come on!

01:56:11.632 --> 01:56:12.925
Go!

01:57:03.475 --> 01:57:04.518
What is it?

01:57:04.601 --> 01:57:05.769
It'll be fine.

01:57:46.685 --> 01:57:47.769
Hey, hey.

01:57:47.853 --> 01:57:49.271
Hey, wake up.

01:57:49.354 --> 01:57:51.356
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:52.774
Come on.

01:57:53.609 --> 01:57:55.152
Come on, come on.

01:57:56.028 --> 01:57:57.154
Hey, wake up.

01:57:58.113 --> 01:57:59.615
Hey!

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.659
Come on, wake up.

01:58:03.243 --> 01:58:04.328
Wake up.

01:58:29.895 --> 01:58:31.146
<i>Tell us your fantasy.</i>

01:58:31.230 --> 01:58:32.940
<i>We'll give you the memory.</i>

01:58:33.023 --> 01:58:34.733
<i>Don't mess with your mind, man.</i>

01:58:35.067 --> 01:58:35.901
<i>It ain't worth it.</i>

01:58:35.984 --> 01:58:37.236
<i>Secret agent.</i>

01:58:37.319 --> 01:58:38.612
<i>That's you. Right?</i>

01:58:47.204 --> 01:58:48.247
Hi.

01:58:50.791 --> 01:58:51.875
Hey.

01:58:54.002 --> 01:58:55.254
Hey.

01:58:56.088 --> 01:58:57.422
Are you okay?

01:59:00.217 --> 01:59:01.468
Yeah.

01:59:02.094 --> 01:59:04.054
We did it.

01:59:19.278 --> 01:59:20.362
No!

01:59:20.779 --> 01:59:21.822
Hey!

01:59:21.905 --> 01:59:23.115
There's no scar on your hand.

01:59:23.782 --> 01:59:24.866
Hey, hey!

01:59:25.158 --> 01:59:26.535
Come on!

01:59:46.930 --> 01:59:48.557
Did you think I'd let you leave

01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:50.309
without a kiss good-bye?

01:59:57.316 --> 01:59:59.526
"Till death do us part," right, baby?

02:00:00.152 --> 02:00:01.194
That's right.

02:00:08.577 --> 02:00:09.578
Drop the weapon now!

02:00:09.661 --> 02:00:10.996
It's all right. It's him.

02:00:20.505 --> 02:00:21.590
You okay, sir?

02:00:21.673 --> 02:00:23.634
- Yeah.
- You sure?

02:00:24.343 --> 02:00:26.136
We've got a medic down in here.

02:00:50.869 --> 02:00:52.329
Oh, my God.

02:00:56.875 --> 02:00:58.210
Thank you.

02:00:59.044 --> 02:01:02.631
<i>People are spilling into the streets
all across The Colony,</i>

02:01:02.714 --> 02:01:04.966
<i>celebrating what many hope will finally be</i>

02:01:05.050 --> 02:01:07.260
<i>a path to an independent nation.</i>

02:01:07.344 --> 02:01:08.387
<i>A new page in history</i>

02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:11.306
<i>has been turned
as the invasion so many feared</i>

02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:13.058
<i>ended with the destruction of The Fall,</i>

02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:17.062
<i>a longtime symbol of economic
and political oppression.</i>

02:01:17.145 --> 02:01:19.815
<i>No word yet on the fate
of Chancellor Cohaagen,</i>

02:01:19.898 --> 02:01:23.944
<i>but we are being told that he perished
along with his forces.</i>

02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:32.994
Jesus Christ.

02:01:33.370 --> 02:01:34.413
I know.

02:01:34.496 --> 02:01:35.789
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

02:01:52.264 --> 02:01:55.142
Hey, what is it?

02:01:59.563 --> 02:02:00.731
Hey,

02:02:00.856 --> 02:02:02.065
you all right?

02:02:02.566 --> 02:02:04.359
Yeah.

02:02:07.154 --> 02:02:08.196
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:09.573
You sure?
