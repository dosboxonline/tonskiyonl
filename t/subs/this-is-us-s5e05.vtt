I think I just got the part.

When I was 18, I was in

00:37.704 --> 00:39.706
<i>And when it ended...</i>

00:52.761 --> 00:57.724
So you're telling me
that this boyfriend of yours...

00:57.807 --> 00:59.976
Got me pregnant, yeah.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.856
And I was nowhere near ready to be a mom.

01:04.939 --> 01:07.233
And I could not...

01:07.317 --> 01:11.488
Ooh, I could not be tied to that
guy for the rest of my life.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.782
You know, so...

01:13.865 --> 01:16.117
I had an abortion.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.039
And it was, I mean, the toughest decision

01:21.122 --> 01:23.124
I've ever made in my life.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.211
But I don't regret it.

01:26.294 --> 01:31.758
But I made it alone,
and you know, I've lived with it alone.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.595
Wait. What are your eyes doing?
Are you judging me?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.764
No.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.600
No, of course not.

01:42.394 --> 01:46.147
I'm just trying
to wrap my head around the...

01:47.440 --> 01:50.318
Uh, why did it take you so long
to tell me this?

01:51.403 --> 01:53.321
Well, it's not exactly something

01:53.405 --> 01:56.408
that comes up naturally in a conversation.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.410
Actually, it is.

02:00.370 --> 02:02.997
It took us two years to have Jack.

02:03.081 --> 02:07.252
That's two years of talking
about pregnancy all the time.

02:07.335 --> 02:10.296
Toby, you don't understand.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.298
I was 18 years old,

02:12.382 --> 02:15.969
and that decision was wrapped up
in the darkest,

02:16.052 --> 02:21.307
lowest, most painful... time of my life.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.144
It was, like, the most painful
relationship of my life.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.980
And all I wanted to do,
I wanted to lock it up,

02:27.063 --> 02:28.898
you know, and I didn't want
to think about it.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.901
I didn't want to think about him.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.655
He was so cruel... to me.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.368
I would like you to tell me his name,

02:40.452 --> 02:43.496
and then, I would like to find him,

02:43.580 --> 02:45.623
and I would like to kill him.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.292
-Babe.
-I want to kill him.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.668

Thank you. That's very sweet.

02:50.795 --> 02:52.297
You know what?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.882
He's in the past, it's all in the past.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.676
-It's...
-Is it, though? If it was

02:56.760 --> 02:59.554
truly in the past,
then why would it take you four years

02:59.637 --> 03:01.931

Because it's two weeks of filming, right?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.711
Plus, two weeks quarantine,

04:54.794 --> 04:57.172

07:25.487 --> 07:26.988
Uh, by Pennsylvania law,

I'm required to ask you
this list of questions

Are you taking any medications
or other drugs?

Kate?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.438
Um, so where do they actually do it?

08:00.522 --> 08:02.232
Will it be in here?

08:02.315 --> 08:05.026
No. The procedure would happen
in the room next door.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.279
And that happens today, right?

08:08.363 --> 08:10.573
Mm. No, honey.
We're legally required

08:10.657 --> 08:13.243
to wait 24 hours after meeting the patient

08:13.326 --> 08:15.245

-Hi.

I spent the entire night

08:40.895 --> 08:43.523

I just...

08:43.606 --> 08:46.192
I just felt like--

08:46.276 --> 08:47.652
I don't know-- you were right.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.571
Right, like, I was clearly
not past the past.

08:49.654 --> 08:53.199
And that's why I took out my laptop,
I went for a dive,

08:53.283 --> 08:56.411
and I found out that he's in San Diego.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.038

but I could really use your support.

-MADISON: That is

11:25.685 --> 11:27.896
-so reassuring, I can't tell you.
-Unbelievable.

11:27.979 --> 11:28.938
And you're good with extended travel,

11:29.022 --> 11:30.315
right?
Because nowadays,

11:30.398 --> 11:31.608
you never know where these movies
are gonna shoot.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.318
-So...
-My passport's always up-to-date.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.570
Oh, that's great.
That's great, because we want someone

11:35.653 --> 11:37.447
who travels with us
to keep things consistent for the twins.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.698
-NATASHA: Mm-hmm.
-MADISON: I mean,

11:38.782 --> 11:40.784
sure, there'll be occasional travel,

11:40.867 --> 11:43.620
but most of the time,
we'll be here in L.A.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.871
KEVIN:
Mm.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.373
Yeah. I mean, that's the hope.

11:46.456 --> 11:48.291
Yeah, you hope for that, but, you know,

11:48.375 --> 11:49.876
as we just found out, these movies,

11:49.959 --> 11:51.961
they'll shoot 'em anywhere, so...

11:53.380 --> 11:56.341
-I've gone all over the world with my families.
-KEVIN: Mm.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.676
I know how to help them adjust

11:57.759 --> 11:59.386
to constantly changing locations.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.263
Starting new schools,
you know, making new friends.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.767
BETH:
Hey.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.269
You're home early.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.399
What's wrong?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.488
So, a man named Hai Lang

12:18.571 --> 12:21.783
-submitted a city complaint form on the website.
-Mm-hmm.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.161
He used it as a way
to get in touch with me personally.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.123
"My name's Hai Lang,
and I live in New Orleans.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.126
"I recognized the name
William Hill from a video

12:31.209 --> 12:34.129
"I saw of you on the Internet.

12:34.212 --> 12:38.008
Not 100% certain, but I believe
I knew your mother, Laurel."

12:38.091 --> 12:40.885
-What?
-"We were close friends.

12:40.969 --> 12:45.140
I was by her side when she died
in May of 2015."

12:47.600 --> 12:49.310
Doesn't exactly jive
with the whole "she died

12:49.394 --> 12:50.687
after I was born" story, huh?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.355
-Randall, what the hell?
-I don't know.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.107
-I'm gonna go, um...
-Wait.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.443
Oh, my God.

12:56.526 --> 12:59.362
He sent a picture.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.907
Randall, is this her?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.577
How would I know, Beth?

13:05.660 --> 13:08.079
I've never seen the woman before.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.930
(sighs)

13:26.014 --> 13:27.807
(sniffles)

13:41.279 --> 13:42.781
(footsteps approaching)

13:42.864 --> 13:46.242
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.078
I was thinking about
bringing in Monk's for dinner.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.372
Been craving those crab legs.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.499
I will see you in a bit.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.669
Did you really just peck and go?

13:55.752 --> 13:56.920
Uh, Randall,

13:57.003 --> 13:58.672
this is not a peck and go situation.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.757
Okay?
We need to talk about this.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.843
I was wondering for 36 years.

14:03.927 --> 14:05.804
I got my answers.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.889
I'm not going down this road.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.518
I understand that.
But why?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.228
-Beth, come on.
-Okay, Randall...

14:13.311 --> 14:15.313
'Cause it would mean he lied to me.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.027
<i>How did you meet my mother?</i>

14:22.112 --> 14:25.198
On a bus, of all places.
(chuckles softly)

14:25.281 --> 14:28.410
My God, she was so beautiful.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.246
I got to tell you something.
One look at that face,

14:31.329 --> 14:35.208
and my world spun on every axis.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.752
Fallen as we were back then,

14:37.836 --> 14:41.256
when she found out about you,
she was so excited.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.426
I'd never seen a woman
so determined to get clean,

14:44.509 --> 14:45.969
to stay clean,

14:46.052 --> 14:48.972
to do right by this baby.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.641
To do right by you.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.686
And she did.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.896
For nine months.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.402
But then, after the birth,

15:02.485 --> 15:05.864
the pain took hold of her like a demon.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.367
I lost her the next day.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.499
If, um...

15:16.583 --> 15:19.169
If she really did die
just a few years ago,

15:19.252 --> 15:21.880
it would mean
that William lied to me, Beth.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.635
Think you should, um...

15:27.719 --> 15:30.013
call your therapist on this one?

15:30.096 --> 15:31.264
I don't need to call my therapist.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.391
I need... I need to go for a run.

15:38.396 --> 15:41.524
He needs to call his therapist.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.698
KEVIN:
You hated her, right?

15:48.782 --> 15:51.326
Well, you know what?
Screw her

15:51.409 --> 15:54.245
and that glorious Range Rover
that she rode in on.

15:54.329 --> 15:58.875
Jet-setting all over the world
with our kids and their nannies?

15:58.958 --> 16:02.837
That's not exactly the life
I pictured for our family.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.798
Well, uh, you know,

16:04.881 --> 16:07.425
what about private jet-setting
all over the world

16:07.509 --> 16:09.803
with our kids and their nannies?

16:13.431 --> 16:15.642
Okay.
Look, Madison, I am lost here.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.769
Uh, you know, just a bit ago,

16:17.852 --> 16:20.313
you were pushing me out the door
to go to Vancouver, right?

16:20.397 --> 16:24.317
And now you're upset that we're
traveling for my work?

16:24.401 --> 16:26.319
I pushed you to go to Vancouver

16:26.403 --> 16:28.113
because the babies aren't here yet

16:28.196 --> 16:31.533
and because I know how much
this movie means to you.

16:31.616 --> 16:36.371
And you made a commitment
to a lot of people, but...

16:36.454 --> 16:40.709
you also made a commitment
to me and these kids.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.795
I didn't realize that where we lived

16:43.878 --> 16:45.964
was as important as being a family.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.966
And how did you think this would work?

16:48.049 --> 16:51.511
Did you just assume that me and the kids

16:51.594 --> 16:54.139
would become your international roadies?

16:54.222 --> 16:57.183
No, I didn't...
I wouldn't say that phrase.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.145
What... You know,
I thought we would stick together.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.479
Me, too.

17:01.563 --> 17:03.648
In our home.

17:06.943 --> 17:08.862
What do you want me to do?

17:10.739 --> 17:13.074
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to quit acting,

17:13.158 --> 17:15.785
Madison?
It took me 20 years to get here.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.081
But I'm not exactly
in a position where I can dictate

17:20.165 --> 17:21.541
where they shoot things, okay?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.627
And quite frankly, I'm...

17:24.711 --> 17:27.756
I'm struggling to figure out

17:27.839 --> 17:30.550
how this is all of a sudden news to you.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.512
It's not.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.016
Look, I have been growing

17:38.099 --> 17:40.935
two humans inside my body, living with you

17:41.019 --> 17:42.687
in this bubble.
I mean, I'm sorry

17:42.771 --> 17:43.938
if the realities of your career

17:44.022 --> 17:45.857
haven't exactly been top of mind.

17:46.858 --> 17:50.653
I'm not trying
to give you a hard time, but...

17:50.737 --> 17:53.448
I was willing to do this on my own.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.784
Remember?

17:55.867 --> 17:57.994
I was never gonna ask you for anything,

17:58.078 --> 18:00.497
but you insisted on being

18:00.580 --> 18:02.165
a part of our lives, and now I have gone

18:02.248 --> 18:05.251
and fallen in love
with this idea of our family.

18:13.218 --> 18:16.262
(Kevin grunts)

18:16.346 --> 18:18.765
Well, I have gone and fallen in love

18:18.848 --> 18:21.851
with the idea of our family, too.

18:28.692 --> 18:31.152
KATE:
Here we are. This is where Marc works

18:31.236 --> 18:34.239
according to his Myspace page.

18:34.322 --> 18:36.116
TOBY:
This guy has a Myspace page?

18:36.199 --> 18:40.245
Of all the things that you
have told me about this guy,

18:40.328 --> 18:43.331
him having a Myspace page
is the creepiest.

18:48.712 --> 18:50.839
Hey. You all right?

18:50.922 --> 18:52.966
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

18:53.049 --> 18:55.593
TOBY:
Maybe I should go in with you.

18:56.678 --> 18:59.264
No, you don't need to go in with me.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.520
(sighs)

19:18.158 --> 19:20.076
Kate Pearson.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.579
I knew you couldn't stay away.

19:33.923 --> 19:37.135
Um, Marc?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.978
MARC: Well, it, uh,
takes a little while to make a lady

19:47.062 --> 19:49.522
all of her favorite
breakfast foods for lunch.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.066
We got one bagel,

19:51.149 --> 19:53.193
which is scooped, lightly toasted,

19:53.276 --> 19:54.402
butter on the side.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.653
And then we have

19:55.737 --> 19:58.114
an egg, very, very runny.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.949
(chuckles):
Which is still, to me,

20:00.033 --> 20:01.910
like eating an oyster
from the ass of a chicken.

20:01.993 --> 20:03.578
(chuckles)
But it's the way you like it.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.038
I don't judge.
And then we got

20:05.121 --> 20:06.581
one coffee, nonfat milk.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.458
No Sweet'N Low, though,
because I didn't have any,

20:08.541 --> 20:11.044
and for that, I am very sorry.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.046
You remembered everything.

20:13.129 --> 20:15.131
(chuckles softly)
Course I did.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.719
I really did miss you.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.394
You're still upset about the cabin.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.689
I am so sorry, Kate.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.315
I was such a dick.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.860
I-I don't know.
I-I don't know what happens to me.

20:35.944 --> 20:37.904
It's, um...

20:37.987 --> 20:40.323
It's like a switch flips inside me,

20:40.407 --> 20:42.575
um, which...
That's so not an excuse.

20:42.659 --> 20:44.452
-Marc.
-And I should've apologized to you

20:44.536 --> 20:46.913
the second I saw you today, but I just...

20:46.996 --> 20:48.790
I thought that you showing up here

20:48.873 --> 20:50.583
was you saying you forgive me.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.128
Well, that's not what I'm saying.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.629
I mean...

20:54.713 --> 20:57.465
I mean, that's not what
I came here to say.

20:58.967 --> 21:01.177
Well, what'd you come here to say?

21:05.223 --> 21:06.641
(sighs)
Okay.

21:07.726 --> 21:09.394
Uh-oh.
This sounds heavy.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.563
Well, it is.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.154
(sighs deeply)

21:20.155 --> 21:22.407
(chuckles)
You're annoyed now?

21:23.408 --> 21:25.869
Um...

21:25.952 --> 21:27.287
I'm just a little whiplashed,

21:27.370 --> 21:30.707
'cause I was, like,
really, really happy to see you.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.084
And then now it's just like...

21:33.168 --> 21:34.502
ugh.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.213
(sighs)

21:38.882 --> 21:40.884
You know what,

21:40.967 --> 21:43.636
let's just chill
and let's just watch some TV, huh?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.722
Let's just, like, be here with each other.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.932
Huh?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.851
Come on.

21:49.934 --> 21:52.062

Oh, wait, that's <i>Airplane!</i>

21:57.192 --> 22:00.195

Could you actually not change it?

22:00.278 --> 22:01.738

Hey, yo, I got, uh, the DVD

of Michel Gondry's music videos.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.796

Wow.

Kate Pearson.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.442
What are the odds?

23:20.525 --> 23:21.818
Do you live in SD?

No.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.480
MANAGER:
Three smoke breaks in one hour?

23:58.563 --> 24:00.231
-Really?
-I'm sorry, man.

24:00.315 --> 24:01.649
MANAGER:
We've talked about this.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.735
If you're gonna work here,
you got to <i>work here.</i>

24:03.818 --> 24:06.196
-Yeah.
-You have five minutes.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.322
(sniffs)

24:07.405 --> 24:09.574
It's not a long-term job.
(inhales)

24:09.657 --> 24:11.034
I got this band I've been managing

24:11.117 --> 24:13.370
and we're getting a residency
at this club,

24:13.453 --> 24:15.121
so...

24:17.791 --> 24:20.418
Okay, can I ask you a question?

24:21.503 --> 24:23.963
Okay. Sure.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.177
What do you remember
about our relationship?

24:29.260 --> 24:30.512
Like, when you look back on it, I mean.

24:31.596 --> 24:33.556
Really?
(chuckles)

24:33.640 --> 24:35.558
That's why you're here?

24:35.642 --> 24:38.478
To rehash our six-month
relationship from...

24:38.561 --> 24:40.939
20 years ago?

24:41.022 --> 24:41.940
(scoffs)

24:42.023 --> 24:43.566
You know what, forget it.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.069
Forget about it.
Goodbye, Marc.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.737
Sorry.
Uh, hold on.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.030
Sorry. I'm sorry.

24:51.408 --> 24:54.869
When I look back on it, I think...

24:55.870 --> 24:57.914
...we were in love?

24:57.997 --> 24:59.290
Um...

24:59.374 --> 25:01.376
I mean, you had great taste in music.

25:01.459 --> 25:02.711
And...

25:03.795 --> 25:05.797
...you were broken, you know,

25:05.880 --> 25:07.382
in all the right places.

25:08.466 --> 25:12.012
And, yeah, things got intense
at times, but, like,

25:12.095 --> 25:14.764
we were kids.

25:15.849 --> 25:17.517
No.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.102
I was a kid.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.563
You were a 24-year-old man.

25:21.646 --> 25:24.899
And I wasn't broken.
I was grieving.

25:24.983 --> 25:26.943
My dad just died.

25:27.027 --> 25:29.029
And I was destroyed

25:29.112 --> 25:31.448
and so vulnerable and you knew it.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.533
You liked it.

25:33.616 --> 25:34.826
-(chuckles): Okay...
-W-- No, no, no.

25:34.909 --> 25:36.661
I'm not finished.

25:37.662 --> 25:39.414
(scoffs)

25:39.497 --> 25:41.833
What you did to me...

25:43.251 --> 25:46.171
...how you held my self-esteem
in your hand

25:46.254 --> 25:49.215
and then you decided to crush it,

25:49.299 --> 25:51.718
God, that damaged me, Marc.

25:51.801 --> 25:53.553
For years,

25:53.636 --> 25:55.472
I swallowed my dreams,

25:55.555 --> 25:57.474
my feelings...

25:57.557 --> 25:59.642
and a lot of food.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.644
No, no, look at me.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.188
Look at me.

26:03.271 --> 26:05.482
You need to get this.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.902
The time that it took for me
to heal from you

26:08.985 --> 26:11.488
stole years of my life.

26:11.571 --> 26:12.739
And I can't get them back.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.659
(chuckles)
Took me a while,

26:16.743 --> 26:18.328
yeah, but I, um...

26:18.411 --> 26:20.580
I found someone who...

26:20.663 --> 26:23.833
loves me the way
that I deserve to be loved.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.169
I have a beautiful son

26:26.252 --> 26:28.171
and an incredible husband,

26:28.254 --> 26:29.756
who's actually in that car

26:29.839 --> 26:31.591
and who was just, like, seconds away

26:31.675 --> 26:35.720
from wanting to just pulverize
you with his bare hands.

26:38.014 --> 26:41.226
I'm not broken.
You're the one that's broken, Marc.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.646
You're the disease.

26:45.814 --> 26:49.567
And I'm not carrying it a moment longer.

26:49.651 --> 26:51.444
So...

26:51.528 --> 26:54.447
I give it back to you.

26:54.531 --> 26:56.741
Good luck with it, Marc.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.938
<i>At 16, you put ads in the paper.</i>

<i>Your whole life,</i>

30:24.449 --> 30:28.453
<i>Why do you think you needed that?</i>

30:28.536 --> 30:30.497

that you come from a family

I think you should use this time
away to be real with yourself.

this relationship and family
