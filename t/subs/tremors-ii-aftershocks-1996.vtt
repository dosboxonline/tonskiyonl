WEBVTT

02:21.166 --> 02:23.084
Oh!

02:37.641 --> 02:40.810
Aah!

04:05.645 --> 04:08.565
Wildfire, you either walk
into that other corral,

04:08.648 --> 04:12.068
or I'm gonna shoot ya
and drag your carcass in there.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.697
Come on, Wildfire.
Come on, boy.

04:15.780 --> 04:18.909
Let's go meet Susie now.
You'll like her.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.911
You two
gotta get together.

04:23.705 --> 04:26.458
Gotcha!
Whoa, whoa!

04:26.541 --> 04:30.253
Whoa, boy, whoa!
Whoa!

04:30.337 --> 04:32.255
Damn it.

04:40.096 --> 04:42.557
You and Susie are gonna
make some little birds,

04:42.557 --> 04:44.935
or I'm gonna take some
barbecue sauce to ya!

05:11.586 --> 05:13.922
Earl Basset, right?

05:14.005 --> 05:17.092
I told you
that's the other one.

05:30.021 --> 05:32.941
Señor Basset.

05:35.318 --> 05:39.489
This is beautiful
county, but very isolated.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.993
I had great difficulty finding
you, but I'm glad I did.

05:43.076 --> 05:47.122
You see, we have had to close down
one of Mexico's biggest oil fields.

05:47.205 --> 05:50.041
Several workers
have been killed.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.336
Ah, we have
now determined that...

05:53.420 --> 05:55.672
the men were killed by...

05:55.755 --> 05:59.634
certain large
underground animals.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.181
Graboids.

06:05.265 --> 06:09.477
Ah! I told you that's
what they named 'em.
Excuse me.

06:11.021 --> 06:13.773
You mean...
there's more of them?

06:13.857 --> 06:17.736
Yes. The company is facing
very expensive delays.

06:17.819 --> 06:21.740
But more importantly,
there are many isolated people
who live in the region.

06:21.823 --> 06:23.742
Many lives are in danger.

06:23.825 --> 06:28.163
We need someone, an expert,
to eliminate these creatures.

06:30.749 --> 06:35.378
- You want somebody
to go graboid hunting?
- Sí.

06:39.382 --> 06:42.636
Ah, señor,
please, please!

06:42.719 --> 06:45.388
We've already spoken
to your partner, Señor McKee.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.390
H-He is unwilling
to help us.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.769
Sure, Val married a good woman.
Why would he want to die?

06:50.852 --> 06:54.773
Of course, we are willing to pay.
They're willing to pay!

07:03.531 --> 07:05.450
'Kay.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.662
$50,000.

07:08.745 --> 07:11.498
Go... away.

07:11.581 --> 07:16.336
No, no, no. He wants to pay you
$50,000 for each graboid.

07:16.419 --> 07:18.380
Look.

07:19.589 --> 07:22.467
No way. Not for
any amount of money.

07:22.550 --> 07:25.345
But for you, getting those worms
would be a piece of cake.

07:25.428 --> 07:28.223
Who are you?
And why are you so dumb?

07:28.306 --> 07:30.433
Oh, Grady. Grady.

07:30.517 --> 07:33.186
Grady Hoover. It's an honour
to meet you, Mr. Basset, sir.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.646
I'm probably your biggest fan.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.692
That Reebok commercial
with you guys runnin' through
the desert-- so very cool.

07:38.775 --> 07:41.736
- You like that, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

07:44.114 --> 07:47.576
Listen, could I come in?
I mean,just for a second.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.789
Great.

07:55.208 --> 07:57.127
Thanks.

07:57.210 --> 08:00.755
Earl Basset.
ohh!

08:00.839 --> 08:04.175
Yep. I've read
every one of these.

08:04.259 --> 08:08.179
I got two copies of this one.
I keep one wrapped in plastic.

08:08.263 --> 08:12.183
Oh, my God, you got
your own one of these!

08:12.267 --> 08:16.771
Oh, I bet you made a fortune off this.
Quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter.

08:16.855 --> 08:19.774
Well, somebody did.
It sure wasn't me.

08:21.234 --> 08:25.488
Well, you musta got a percentage.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.490
I shoulda got
a lawyer.

08:27.574 --> 08:31.536
Wow. That sucks.

08:34.623 --> 08:37.042
Did he really say
$50,000?

08:37.125 --> 08:39.878
Stack of Bibles.

08:42.297 --> 08:44.256
Forget it.

08:47.886 --> 08:50.555
You boys don't know
how mean these things are.

08:50.639 --> 08:54.142
Well, okay--
okay, but--
That was my big chance.

08:54.225 --> 08:59.356
Yeah, but M-Mr Basset--
You only get one of those
in life, and I blew it...

08:59.439 --> 09:02.692
on god-damn Big Bird
and his scrawny girlfriend!

09:04.819 --> 09:08.198
Yeah, but 50,000.

09:08.281 --> 09:10.200
That's what
she's doin' there.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.202
Who?

09:12.285 --> 09:16.915
Ooh. '' Miss October, 1979?

09:16.998 --> 09:22.587
Yeah, she's there to remind me
not to keep chasin' after things
I'm never gonna get.

09:22.671 --> 09:24.798
But why wouldn't
you get this?

09:24.881 --> 09:28.802
Earl-- Mr Basset,
you're the expert. You guys
kicked ass with those things.

09:28.885 --> 09:31.805
And this time, you'll be
a step ahead of them.

09:31.888 --> 09:35.308
The Mexican army is willin'
to give you whatever you want.

09:35.392 --> 09:39.229
Dynamite.
Shh, whoo, wa-bam! 50 Gs!

09:46.778 --> 09:49.948
Maybe this is your
big second chance.

10:06.715 --> 10:09.634
Señor Ortega,
you've got a deal.

10:09.718 --> 10:12.345
Bravo, bravo!
And I'm goin' with him.

10:12.429 --> 10:15.974
Ah, muy bien, muy bien!
Um, if you'll excuse me?

10:18.059 --> 10:21.521
What? Why do you think
I drove all this way?

10:21.605 --> 10:24.566
When he said he was looking
for the Earl Basset,

10:24.649 --> 10:27.569
I knew Opportunity
was knockin', and I was home.

10:27.652 --> 10:29.613
I don't even know you.

10:29.696 --> 10:34.492
I drive a taxi;
I live in a crappy apartment;
I watch too much TV; etcetera.

10:34.576 --> 10:39.289
Look, you're going to need a partner.
How many people would want to do this?

10:39.372 --> 10:44.294
I'll do anything you want:
carry luggage, make coffee,

10:44.377 --> 10:46.296
light fuses.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.052
Maybe you will come in handy.

10:52.135 --> 10:56.097
Ha! When they're eating you, it'll
give me a chance to get away.

11:33.885 --> 11:35.804
Uh-oh.

11:36.846 --> 11:40.183
Who gets the last soda?
One, two--

11:40.267 --> 11:43.353
What?
Scissors, rock, paper.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.106
One, two, three!
What's this?

11:46.189 --> 11:49.568
Scissors cuts paper.
I win.

12:20.015 --> 12:21.933
Buenos días, señores.

12:22.017 --> 12:26.187
Ustedes dos son los americanos
cazadores de monstruos?
Um--

12:26.271 --> 12:30.025
Um-- Quien es-- uh--

12:30.108 --> 12:32.819
No, no, no, no.
''Dónde está...''
Señor Ortega?

12:32.903 --> 12:36.448
Ortega? Oh, Ortega,
venga acá. Están aquí.

12:36.531 --> 12:39.910
Welcome. Welcome, gentlemen.
You made good time.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.579
The sooner we get here,
the sooner we can leave.

12:42.662 --> 12:46.082
- This is Pedro, the company's
chief engineer.
- Mucho gusto.

12:46.166 --> 12:48.877
Uh, buenos días. Y su nuevo
compañero, el Sr. Hoover.

12:48.960 --> 12:53.256
Mucho gusto.
Buena suerte y que los monstruos
no los coman a ustedes.

12:53.340 --> 12:56.426
Pedro.

12:56.509 --> 13:00.555
Um, I have all
your equipment over here.

13:00.639 --> 13:03.475
Oh, by the way,
I have some good news.

13:03.558 --> 13:07.896
We offer you double the price
if you are able to capture
one of the animals alive.

13:07.979 --> 13:11.691
Double?
Alive? Have you ever seen
one of these things?

13:11.775 --> 13:16.821
It is only a suggestion--
if it was possible
to capture one of them.

13:16.905 --> 13:20.325
No, you never know.
Earl, you never know.
Yes, I do.

13:20.408 --> 13:22.827
Never should have
come down here.

13:27.165 --> 13:30.085
The army has sent
everything you requested.

13:30.168 --> 13:32.587
You have asked for some...

13:32.671 --> 13:34.589
unusual things.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.932
Earl, please
check this out.

13:44.015 --> 13:46.935
Look, this isn't
some kind of party.

13:47.018 --> 13:48.937
I know that.

13:49.020 --> 13:52.440
I just think we should show
a little enthusiasm here.

14:04.369 --> 14:07.289
Let me introduce you
to Kate Riley.
Hi.

14:07.372 --> 14:10.292
She's the geologist for the oil company.
And these are the men--

14:10.375 --> 14:14.879
I know, I know. The monster hunters.
I saw you on Good Morning, America...

14:14.963 --> 14:17.382
or, uh, one of those.

14:17.465 --> 14:21.553
Yeah, this is, uh, the Earl
Basset, the one and only.

14:21.636 --> 14:25.265
Uh, that's right.
Nice to meet ya.

14:25.348 --> 14:28.893
- Really nice to meet you.
- I'm Grady Hoover, the new guy.

14:28.977 --> 14:30.896
Nice... hat.
Thanks.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.356
I hope to hear
good news soon.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.736
Miss Riley will stay in contact
with me. Let us know
anything else you need.

14:37.819 --> 14:39.738
And, uh...

14:39.821 --> 14:42.616
well, best of luck
to you, huh?

14:42.699 --> 14:44.659
Vaya con Dios.

14:46.745 --> 14:51.416
So this is the place.
I'll show you around.
You thirsty or anything?

14:51.499 --> 14:55.086
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I am.

14:55.170 --> 14:58.089
Anyway, we've been
pretty nervous down here.

14:58.173 --> 15:01.092
Glad you guys were willin'
to come all this way.

15:01.176 --> 15:04.012
It sure is in
the middle of nowhere.

15:04.095 --> 15:08.016
Well, of course.
Stuff like this only happens in the middle of nowhere.

15:09.392 --> 15:11.645
- Hey,Julio.
- Hey, Kate.

15:11.728 --> 15:14.648
So? It's all done.
They're all working.

15:14.731 --> 15:19.444
Yes, yes! Guys, this is Julio.
He's been setting up
the seismographs. Earl, Grady.

15:19.527 --> 15:22.447
Yes, I've seen you
in the magazines.

15:22.530 --> 15:25.450
Actually, I'm not
the original guy.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.161
You know, you musta made
a lot of money, huh?

15:28.203 --> 15:30.872
The royalties on that
video game alone! Ooh.

15:30.914 --> 15:34.834
Julio, we should be able to
get an accurate count now, right?

15:34.918 --> 15:38.004
Yes, yes. I have a friend
who invested in that company.

15:49.266 --> 15:51.184
Hey.

15:51.268 --> 15:54.479
Hi. Come on in.

15:54.563 --> 15:59.234
So, uh, we were
gonna look over some maps?

15:59.317 --> 16:02.654
Right. Um, coffee?

16:02.737 --> 16:05.156
Yeah, black.

16:05.240 --> 16:08.326
How were those
burritos, anyway?

16:08.410 --> 16:10.495
Um, good. Good.

16:10.579 --> 16:13.248
Yeah, sorry about that.

16:13.331 --> 16:16.751
Pretty bad, I know. But with Cook
gone, that's best we've got.

16:19.462 --> 16:22.841
So, um... how many of you
are still workin' out here?

16:22.924 --> 16:26.845
Only the three of us.
They had to shut the whole
operation down.

16:26.928 --> 16:28.847
Six people got killed--

16:28.930 --> 16:30.849
people I knew.

16:30.932 --> 16:35.937
Hmm. Well, uh,
how come you stayed on?
Well--

16:36.021 --> 16:39.816
You're not scared?
Shit, yeah, I'm scared.

16:39.900 --> 16:42.235
But...
I'm also fascinated.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.237
It's, uh--

16:44.321 --> 16:47.365
With me, ''fascinated ''
usually wins.

16:47.449 --> 16:49.910
Maps.

16:49.993 --> 16:52.287
I'll get these cores out
of the way. Come on, baby.

17:09.220 --> 17:14.059
So, uh, have the graboids
come near the refiney yet?

17:14.142 --> 17:17.395
No, they've left us alone.
They stay about 20 miles north.

17:17.479 --> 17:19.897
That's where the workers
were killed.

17:19.981 --> 17:22.400
Who named them
graboids, anyway?

17:22.483 --> 17:27.071
A... friend
of ours, Walter Chang.

17:27.155 --> 17:30.116
He named them,
then they ate him.

17:30.200 --> 17:34.120
Hey, guys,
look what I made.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.255
Just, you know,
drag it behind the truck.

17:45.590 --> 17:49.761
Make, you know,
make more noise.

17:51.846 --> 17:55.976
You see, uh,
graboids hunt by sound.

17:56.059 --> 17:58.979
I'll probably just go hook that
to the back of the truck.

18:21.793 --> 18:24.462
''Moonstros.''
Ah, sí.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.965
Mr Hoover, come here please.

18:27.048 --> 18:29.301
I have the monitor working.

18:29.384 --> 18:31.303
Okay.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.722
We've set up radio
seismographs all over,

18:33.722 --> 18:36.725
so the monitor will show you
where the graboids are.

18:36.766 --> 18:39.644
Cool.

18:39.728 --> 18:41.855
You know, this is
none of my business,

18:41.897 --> 18:44.649
I guess, but you guys are
going out there alone?

18:44.691 --> 18:48.236
You don't want to take with
you the whole army of Mexico?

18:48.278 --> 18:49.696
Let me explain,Julio.

18:49.738 --> 18:52.908
Graboids, they got no eyes.
They hunt by sound.

18:52.991 --> 18:55.827
You make a noise;
they're gonna come after you.

18:55.911 --> 18:59.414
If we get a bunch of people
runnin' around--

18:59.497 --> 19:01.833
Graboids gonna spread
out all over the place.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.668
No, we want 'em all
to come to us.

19:05.086 --> 19:08.673
So you guys are what?
You guys are the bait?

19:10.175 --> 19:12.093
That's the plan.

19:24.522 --> 19:26.983
Okay, so, uh--

19:29.653 --> 19:31.780
That's us.
That's our truck.

19:34.115 --> 19:37.410
Seems like everything's
workin' okay.

19:37.494 --> 19:41.706
Well, sure it is, Earl. This is a
high-tech, professional operation here.

19:41.790 --> 19:46.211
Hey, we got a good plan goin'.
Fifty thousand apiece, baby.

19:46.294 --> 19:50.632
Ho! You know, me,
I'm gonna get mine all at once,

19:50.715 --> 19:52.634
just stacked!

19:52.717 --> 19:56.846
Well, if I make any money this time,
I'll invest it... conservatively.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.559
Hey, you shaved.

20:00.642 --> 20:05.855
What? No, I just... I just
noticed you... you know, shaved.

20:07.816 --> 20:11.152
So what?
A man can shave, can't he?

20:13.530 --> 20:16.700
No, you're right.
She's a babe.

20:48.023 --> 20:50.775
here's where they're
supposed to be.

20:50.859 --> 20:53.653
Man, look at that
county, huh?

20:53.737 --> 20:57.490
Yeah. Not a lot of rocks
and boulders out there.

20:57.574 --> 21:01.036
Not much to climb on if we
don't want to get slurped.

21:04.372 --> 21:07.042
There's mountains around. You said
they can't get through mountains.

21:07.125 --> 21:09.753
I said they can't
go through rock.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.755
These hills are alluvial.

21:11.838 --> 21:14.966
Oh, ''alluvial.''

21:15.050 --> 21:19.179
Wait a minute, that's the little dinglebery
in the back of your throat, right?

21:19.262 --> 21:22.182
You want to hunt graboids;
you better know geology.

21:22.265 --> 21:27.395
Here, you drive. I'm keepin'
my eye on this... seismo-jigger.

21:27.479 --> 21:29.397
Oh, good call.

21:34.986 --> 21:37.989
No offense, Earl, but you're
nervous as a chihuahua.

21:38.073 --> 21:40.283
I'm not nervous.
I'm alert.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.285
Whatever.

22:04.766 --> 22:07.561
Those worms have to be deaf
if they don't hear us.

22:07.644 --> 22:11.189
Hey, take it easy, huh?

22:14.192 --> 22:16.111
Jesus, Grady.
We got one !

22:16.194 --> 22:18.363
- It's spotted us! It's
comin' right toward us!

22:18.405 --> 22:19.573
- Well, that's the idea.

22:19.614 --> 22:23.034
Doesn't mean I have to like it.
Now stop. Stop already!

22:31.960 --> 22:34.337
Okay, time
for the secret weapon.

22:35.672 --> 22:39.634
Careful with that detonator.
Set it like I showed you.

22:39.718 --> 22:44.180
- How dumb do you think I am?
- Catch me later on that one.

23:13.501 --> 23:17.047
- He's comin' in.
I think he's followin' it.

23:17.130 --> 23:20.050
Of course he is.

23:23.720 --> 23:28.225
I can't see it, Earl.
Earl, I can't see it!

23:28.308 --> 23:31.394
Left. Left.
Left?

23:31.478 --> 23:34.773
- Okay, okay.
- Wait. Wait, there.

23:41.154 --> 23:44.449
He did it. He took it.
O-Okay. Hit it! Get him!

23:44.532 --> 23:47.702
Oh, shit. Earl, what are you doin'?
Hit it, hit it!

23:47.786 --> 23:49.871
Hit it!
Hit it, Earl!

23:52.874 --> 23:56.795
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
50 Gs, baby, 50 Gs?

23:56.878 --> 24:00.590
Oh, shit!

24:00.674 --> 24:03.802
Told ya.

24:03.885 --> 24:05.845
I forgot.

24:15.522 --> 24:19.025
- Yeah!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow!

25:03.361 --> 25:05.739
Man, this stuff
really stinks.

25:05.822 --> 25:09.326
Yeah, don't forget
to get that antenna too.

25:35.393 --> 25:38.480
You left the radio
on the ground?

25:38.563 --> 25:40.649
Sorry, I forgot.

26:01.169 --> 26:03.838
Is that a coyote?

26:03.922 --> 26:06.466
Yep.

26:06.549 --> 26:09.511
Man, he better keep quiet.

26:09.594 --> 26:12.681
Yep.

26:23.650 --> 26:26.903
He took it.
Hey, it's my turn.

26:26.987 --> 26:29.906
Oh, c-come on, Earl.
Let me get one more.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.908
Shit.

26:33.201 --> 26:36.162
Rock breaks scissors.
I win.

26:36.246 --> 26:39.124
It does?

26:44.296 --> 26:46.756
I told you one stick
would be enough.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.217
You're right.

26:49.301 --> 26:53.221
That makes $300,000.

26:53.305 --> 26:55.223
Apiece.

26:55.307 --> 26:58.810
I'm feelin' light-headed, Earl.

26:58.894 --> 27:01.730
And whatcha gonna do
with all your money?

27:01.813 --> 27:04.733
Invest it. Well, yeah, of
course, invest it, but--

27:04.816 --> 27:07.569
Even at five percent,
I'll be doin' pretty good.

27:07.652 --> 27:12.866
five percent?
You're talkin', um, mutual funds
or C.D.s or somethin', huh?

27:12.949 --> 27:16.912
That's right.
That's small, Earl.
You're thinkin' small.

27:16.995 --> 27:20.206
See, I'm thinkin'
big.

27:20.290 --> 27:22.667
I'm thinkin' themep_rk.

27:22.751 --> 27:27.505
Now, now.
''Grady Hoover's World
of Natural Wonders.''

27:27.589 --> 27:31.968
Whoa! Or, you know,
maybe somethin' simple,

27:32.052 --> 27:35.972
like ''Monster World,''
or ''Monsterland''...

27:36.056 --> 27:37.974
or ''Worm World.''

27:38.058 --> 27:41.645
How 'bout ''Looney World''?
Seems to fit.
Get off the ground!

27:41.728 --> 27:43.647
It's vision, Earl.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.567
Vision is what separates
the average--

27:55.951 --> 27:58.536
I know that song.

28:01.498 --> 28:04.918
Jesus! Get on the ground,
Grady? Get off the ground?

28:05.001 --> 28:09.422
Whoa!

28:09.506 --> 28:13.593
Jesus, man,
those things are huge!

28:13.677 --> 28:16.179
Shh! Be quiet!
Did you see that mouth?

28:23.353 --> 28:25.814
Oh, no.

28:25.897 --> 28:27.983
It snagged the chain.

28:35.991 --> 28:39.035
Can it do that?

28:44.916 --> 28:47.043
It can't be that strong.

28:54.384 --> 28:56.886
Son of a bitch!

29:01.975 --> 29:04.644
- Hit the brakes!
- I am! I did!

29:04.728 --> 29:06.688
It doesn't work!

29:13.111 --> 29:16.406
Earl!
What do I do?

29:16.489 --> 29:19.200
- I don't know.
Do anything!
- Ooh!

29:39.554 --> 29:43.099
- Cliff!
- Oh, no.

29:53.902 --> 29:57.989
He stopped. He stopped.

30:03.036 --> 30:07.165
Oh, shit.

30:14.923 --> 30:16.841
Oh, come on.

30:29.563 --> 30:31.773
Rock!

30:31.856 --> 30:35.610
Rock?
He's going under it!

30:35.694 --> 30:38.446
Turn! Turn the wheel!

30:38.530 --> 30:41.449
- Turn!
- I'm tying; I'm tying!

30:41.533 --> 30:44.286
Oh, God, oh, God!

30:48.164 --> 30:50.083
Yee-ha!

30:55.088 --> 30:57.632
All right.

30:57.716 --> 30:59.634
You all right?

30:59.718 --> 31:02.637
Wow, chain broke
right off.

31:02.721 --> 31:04.639
Jesus, we're lucky.

31:08.643 --> 31:11.563
Well, truck seems
to be all right.

31:11.646 --> 31:15.483
Earl, that's gonna be the first
ride in my theme park.

31:15.567 --> 31:18.445
Doesn't anything
ever get you down?

31:18.528 --> 31:21.448
Well, I'm blessed
with a sunny disposition.

31:21.531 --> 31:24.117
Most people
seem to like it.

31:26.328 --> 31:29.789
Oh, yeah? What does this
do for your disposition?

31:35.211 --> 31:37.923
I think we're gonna
need some help.

31:38.006 --> 31:41.426
Help? Who'd be crazy enough
to help us with this mess?

31:50.936 --> 31:55.982
The big guns pounded enemy
positions for 72 straight hours.

31:56.066 --> 31:59.778
It was the deadliest
bombardment of the siege.

31:59.861 --> 32:01.738
Yeah?

32:01.821 --> 32:05.450
Hey, Burt, it's Earl.
How ya doin'?

32:05.533 --> 32:07.452
Listen, um,

32:07.535 --> 32:10.455
if this sounds kinda funny, it's
'cause I'm on a radio phone.

32:10.538 --> 32:13.500
It's the only way we
can call out of this place.

32:13.583 --> 32:19.256
Earl? Oh... Earl.
Haven't seen you in a while.

32:21.049 --> 32:24.928
Well, I haven't seen you.
Guess you've been layin'
kinda low, huh?

32:25.011 --> 32:27.514
Layin' low?
No. Negative.

32:27.597 --> 32:30.976
I've been real busy--
lots of projects.

32:31.059 --> 32:34.312
So, uh, how
you and Heather doing?

32:34.396 --> 32:39.276
Well, she, uh--
She's still visiting her sister.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.695
Yeah?

32:41.778 --> 32:44.614
You know, she actually...

32:44.698 --> 32:48.118
blames our problems on the
collapse of the Soviet Union?

32:48.201 --> 32:51.037
Well, you did take that
kinda hard, Burt.

32:51.121 --> 32:57.002
Said I was hard to live with.
Said I couldn't handle life
without the threat of war.

32:57.085 --> 33:02.132
What kind of thing
is that to say to a man?
Well, I don't know, Burt--

33:02.215 --> 33:05.719
Anyway, it takes more
than that to get me down.

33:05.802 --> 33:08.722
I been running around so much,
it's lucky you caught me home.

33:08.805 --> 33:13.768
Well, in that case, I don't know
if you'd be interested in this.

33:13.852 --> 33:17.772
I'm down in Mexico,
see, and I find myself
in a sort of situation.

33:17.856 --> 33:20.317
What kind of situation?

33:23.194 --> 33:25.780
A graboid
kind of situation.

33:40.545 --> 33:43.548
Hey, you keepin'
an eye on that monitor?

33:43.632 --> 33:46.885
Uh, yeah, I'm watchin' it.
They're just stayin' up north.

33:55.227 --> 33:58.188
- Oh, my God!
- What?

33:58.271 --> 34:00.982
Sorry. Come here.
Come here. Look at this.

34:04.444 --> 34:09.366
I've been staring
at this fossil for over a month,
and I just realized what it is.

34:09.449 --> 34:13.370
Hey, Earl, that looks like one
of those spikes on their sides.

34:13.453 --> 34:15.371
Okay, it resembles one.

34:15.455 --> 34:19.708
I really think it is
a fossil fragment of a graboid.

34:19.793 --> 34:22.212
It's gonna take
months to prove--

34:22.295 --> 34:24.255
No, this is important,
isn't it?

34:24.339 --> 34:27.007
Science has never
determined their origin.

34:27.092 --> 34:29.636
I read that in People.

34:29.719 --> 34:35.225
And that's true. But that's not
the only thing. You guys,
this is Precambrian rock.

34:37.226 --> 34:39.187
Precambrian.

34:41.773 --> 34:44.943
Precambrian. That means
that this is the oldest
life form on the planet.

34:45.025 --> 34:47.946
I mean other than one-celled
things. But look at that.

34:48.029 --> 34:52.117
- Wait a minute.
Older than dinosaurs?
- Way.

34:52.199 --> 34:55.120
So they're from earth,
right? Damn.
Yeah.

34:55.203 --> 34:57.831
I always thought
they were from outer space.

34:57.914 --> 35:01.001
Doesn't look like it.

35:01.084 --> 35:04.254
¡Mira, mira!
¡El monstruo más grande...
viene acá!

35:04.337 --> 35:06.548
Look! Look at
the seismograph! Look!

35:06.631 --> 35:09.384
El monstruo viene?
Es grande?

35:22.647 --> 35:24.983
It ain't no graboid.

35:25.066 --> 35:27.319
It's somethin'
more dangerous.

35:41.416 --> 35:43.335
Monster H.Q., I presume.

35:43.418 --> 35:46.004
Hey, Burt,
good to see you.
Earl, good to see you.

35:46.087 --> 35:50.133
Uh, this is Kate,
uh, Pedro,
Hey, what's up?

35:50.216 --> 35:53.637
Julio, and, uh--
The pleasure is mine.

35:53.720 --> 35:56.890
Grady, Grady Hoover.
Yeah, I read all about you,
Mr-- Mr Gummer.

35:56.973 --> 35:59.935
- Yeah, it's a real--
real honour.
- Yes.

36:00.018 --> 36:04.189
Man, you think you got
a big enough truck here?
He the new guy?

36:04.272 --> 36:07.317
So, did you get me one
of those seismo-monitors?

36:07.400 --> 36:10.612
Hey, no problem.
What you got in this thing?

36:10.695 --> 36:12.948
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

36:13.031 --> 36:15.784
Don't touch.
Don't touch. Easy.

36:15.867 --> 36:18.286
Mexican army gave me
this truck...

36:20.997 --> 36:23.959
and a few little items
on my wish list.

36:27.462 --> 36:31.800
Ho!

36:33.510 --> 36:36.555
It's, uh, a bit much,
don't you think?

36:42.727 --> 36:46.022
Maybe I'm wrong.

36:46.106 --> 36:48.024
Hope I'm right.

36:54.030 --> 36:57.075
Makes my home-made stuff
look like cherry bombs.

36:57.158 --> 37:02.706
Thermite, C-4, TNT,
high-explosive... H.E.

37:02.789 --> 37:05.458
ls there such thing
as ''low-explosive''?

37:08.628 --> 37:10.797
Well, y-yes,
son, there is.

37:10.880 --> 37:15.802
I mean, the federales offer
you anything you want, and you
guys take one case of dynamite?

37:15.886 --> 37:18.388
What the hell
is this thing for?

37:18.471 --> 37:22.642
That, uh, might end up
in my collection.

37:22.726 --> 37:25.687
Hey, got some, uh, new equipment
for you, gentlemen.

37:27.772 --> 37:30.692
Your backup weapons.
Can you handle a firearm?

37:30.775 --> 37:33.570
I'll check him out.

37:33.653 --> 37:35.572
Shotguns?

37:35.655 --> 37:38.575
We're not huntin'
rabbits down here, Burt.

37:38.658 --> 37:41.995
Not shotguns.
Double rifles. Elephant guns.

37:42.078 --> 37:47.250
Wesley-Richards 480,
375 H&H Mag.

37:47.334 --> 37:51.046
Knockdown power
up the yin-yang.
Treat them well.

37:51.129 --> 37:55.467
But hold 'em good 'n tight
to your shoulder, or they'll
break your collarbone.

37:55.550 --> 37:58.929
So where's, uh, Mrs Gummer?
She didn't want to come?

37:59.012 --> 38:03.099
Uh, why don't you get this,
uh, stum in our truck?

38:05.310 --> 38:07.229
Sure, no problem.

38:11.942 --> 38:16.279
Look, man, I... really want
to thank you for comin' down.

38:17.906 --> 38:19.824
We're in pretty deep here.

38:19.908 --> 38:21.993
Oh, forget it, Earl.

38:22.077 --> 38:27.958
To tell you the truth, if I
didn't get out of that house,
I was gonna go crazy.

38:30.043 --> 38:32.045
Heather's not comin' back.

38:32.128 --> 38:34.256
No?

38:34.339 --> 38:38.009
She called me and told me
to send her the H.K.-91 .

38:38.093 --> 38:40.220
Whew. Ouch.

38:40.303 --> 38:42.264
Yep.

38:43.515 --> 38:45.433
So.

38:46.893 --> 38:51.439
Anyway, it'll be good to get
into somethin' constructive.

38:54.776 --> 38:57.320
Oh, my.
What is this?

38:57.404 --> 39:00.657
Grizzly single-shot
50-calibre B.M.G....

39:00.740 --> 39:03.577
based on a World War I
antitank cartridge.

39:03.660 --> 39:08.123
- Antitank?
- Had the bullets custom cast
from solid bronze.

39:08.206 --> 39:12.377
Man, Burt, you put a whole new
shine on the word ''overkill.''

39:12.460 --> 39:16.214
When you need it
and don't have it,
you sing a different tune.

39:48.121 --> 39:51.750
Well, this is it, Burt.
Okay.

39:51.833 --> 39:55.003
I'll patrol east.
You take the west.

39:58.465 --> 40:01.384
You know, those are
terrible for you.

40:01.468 --> 40:05.388
You need complex carbohydrates.
Lower those L.D.L.s.

40:05.472 --> 40:08.225
I gave up smoking, Burt.
What more do you want?

40:08.308 --> 40:12.729
- Have an M.R.E.
- A what?

40:12.812 --> 40:14.731
Meals Ready to Eat.

40:14.814 --> 40:16.733
Freeze-dried, foil sealed.

40:16.816 --> 40:20.612
It's got to be foil. Plastic
is not an oxygen barrier.

40:20.695 --> 40:23.823
Includes entrée,
cracker pack, cheese spread,

40:23.907 --> 40:26.910
mixed fruit, beverage powder,
spoon, coffee,

40:26.993 --> 40:31.581
cream substitute, candy, salt,
matches, toilet tissue.

40:31.665 --> 40:34.334
Shelf life of ten years.

40:34.417 --> 40:37.754
Here, take a few.

40:37.837 --> 40:40.757
Buy 'em all the time.
Saves trips to the supermarket.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.884
Oh, no, Burt.

40:42.968 --> 40:45.470
We don't want to use up all your food.
No problem.

40:45.554 --> 40:48.014
Brought 1 20 pounds of it.

40:48.098 --> 40:50.058
Good luck, comp_dres.

40:59.484 --> 41:03.905
Oh, man, this stum
tastes like toilet paper.

41:03.989 --> 41:08.076
Earl,
that is the toilet paper.

41:22.674 --> 41:25.969
14 May.

41:26.052 --> 41:29.014
1500 hours.

41:29.097 --> 41:33.685
I have a confirmed
graboid reading.

41:33.768 --> 41:37.063
I'm now employing the technique
pioneered by Earl Basset...

41:37.147 --> 41:40.984
to make my first kill.

41:47.574 --> 41:49.576
Subject has taken
the bait.

41:49.659 --> 41:51.578
Preparing to fire.

41:51.661 --> 41:53.622
Yes!

42:12.432 --> 42:14.726
Memo:

42:14.809 --> 42:18.313
four pounds of C-4
may be a little...

42:21.483 --> 42:23.401
excessive.

42:28.823 --> 42:32.494
Yo, Grady and Earl.
I got one. Over.

42:34.287 --> 42:37.666
Yeah, we know, Burt.
We heard it clear over here.

42:37.749 --> 42:41.670
Damnedest thing. It had a big
chain hangin' out of its mouth.

42:41.753 --> 42:45.507
Damn it. Burt, you skunk,
that one was ours.

42:45.590 --> 42:50.011
Oh, yeah, son? I didn't see
your name on it. Over and out.

42:50.095 --> 42:52.597
Why did we
invite him, anyway?

42:52.681 --> 42:54.683
Hey, pay attention.

42:54.766 --> 42:58.436
Whoa.
We got one.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.605
Wait a minute.

43:00.689 --> 43:03.233
It's movin' away from us.

43:03.316 --> 43:07.821
It must be
somethin' else.

43:07.904 --> 43:09.823
Like what,
a giant prairie dog?

43:09.906 --> 43:13.535
Well, shit, I don't know, Earl.
It's movin' away from us.

43:16.121 --> 43:18.873
Should we follow it?

43:29.092 --> 43:32.012
What the hell is
the matter with him?

43:32.095 --> 43:35.348
We're makin'
plenty of noise.

43:35.432 --> 43:39.644
I don't like it, Grady.
They're gettin' smarter.
That's what they do.

43:39.728 --> 43:42.647
They got some
kinda plan goin' here.

43:42.731 --> 43:47.360
I tell ya, these boys
are up to somethin' new.

43:48.904 --> 43:52.073
They're diggin'
a trap for us, or...

43:52.157 --> 43:54.075
playin' possum,

43:54.159 --> 43:56.578
or somethin'.

44:02.918 --> 44:05.503
Holy Mother!

44:05.587 --> 44:08.465
Oh, man, oh, man!

44:14.679 --> 44:16.973
Shit! Shit, how
could I do that?

44:17.057 --> 44:18.975
I gotta get
to Burt's gun!

44:20.644 --> 44:22.604
Whoa.

44:25.899 --> 44:28.652
- Where is he?
Should be all over us.
- I don't know.

44:31.613 --> 44:35.617
- What is that? Can they do that?
- shh.

44:37.577 --> 44:39.788
That's a new one on me.

44:45.919 --> 44:48.838
Jesus, Grady, what are you
doin'? Get off the ground!

44:48.922 --> 44:53.552
I know, I know.
I got an idea. Trust me.

44:59.349 --> 45:01.851
Damn it, Grady,
come on back.

45:10.819 --> 45:12.904
He's still there.

45:18.910 --> 45:22.956
What the
hell's it doing?

45:23.039 --> 45:25.458
I have no idea.

46:06.124 --> 46:08.627
Something's wrong
with him.

46:08.710 --> 46:10.629
Must be sick.

46:10.712 --> 46:13.632
Probably ate somebody
that didn't agree with it.

46:25.018 --> 46:26.937
Jesus, Grady!

46:36.571 --> 46:38.490
It's okay, Earl.

46:38.573 --> 46:42.494
He's not goin' anywhere.

46:42.577 --> 46:44.496
Hey!

46:45.580 --> 46:49.709
We just caught ourselves
a live one.

46:49.793 --> 46:52.921
That's $100,000 Earl.

46:53.004 --> 46:54.923
Oh, yes!

46:55.006 --> 46:57.926
Oh, yeah?
What're you gonna do,
cary him back?

46:58.009 --> 46:59.928
We just wrecked
the truck.

47:01.972 --> 47:04.474
Oh, yeah.

47:10.939 --> 47:13.441
Hello, this is Earl
to anybody.

47:13.525 --> 47:16.027
Anybody there?

47:16.111 --> 47:19.614
Hey, Earl, it's Kate.
How're you guys doin'?
Well, uh--

47:20.949 --> 47:23.577
we kinda wrecked our truck a little bit.
What?

47:23.660 --> 47:25.579
A-Are you okay?

47:25.662 --> 47:28.582
We're fine. We're gonna need
somebody to come fetch us.

47:28.665 --> 47:33.545
Let me talk to her.
Would you tell Pedro to bring
that big truck of his out here?

47:33.628 --> 47:36.882
It's got a crane on it,
doesn't it?
Yeah.

47:36.965 --> 47:38.967
It's going to
take him hours.

47:39.050 --> 47:41.511
Tell him to bring it
because--

47:41.595 --> 47:47.267
- We're gonna winch that slinky
off to Monster World.
- Get off the damn ground!

47:47.350 --> 47:49.561
I'm of_, I'm off.

48:04.826 --> 48:07.621
Jesus!

48:07.704 --> 48:10.624
Damn it, he got
himself another one.

48:10.707 --> 48:13.376
The man never sleeps.

48:16.338 --> 48:20.800
Guys, Burt here, doin'
a little night fishing.

48:20.884 --> 48:25.805
Got three of 'em
on a cluster charge. I'd say
we're about even now. Over.

48:25.889 --> 48:29.434
Come on, Burt.
This isn't a competition.
Who's competing?

48:29.517 --> 48:32.437
I'm just saying the score's
tied, that's all. Over.

48:32.520 --> 48:36.191
Well, son, no it isn't,
'cause we just caught
ourselves a live one.

48:36.274 --> 48:40.612
A live one? How in the--
That's a trade secret.
Happy huntin', Burt.

48:43.073 --> 48:46.076
I'll bet that burned
his skinny ass.

48:48.954 --> 48:52.540
God Almighty!

48:56.711 --> 48:59.130
Something's wrong
with our worm, Earl.

49:00.257 --> 49:03.051
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

49:12.561 --> 49:16.106
Maybe somethin's tryin'
to eat it out there--
coyotes or somethin'.

49:16.189 --> 49:18.358
They'll have plenty to eat.

49:18.441 --> 49:21.820
Come on, Earl. We have got
to protect our investment.
We can't just sit here.

49:24.489 --> 49:26.741
Jesus, listen to it!

49:26.825 --> 49:30.787
Poor thing. I mean, don't you
just feel a little sorry for him?

49:30.870 --> 49:34.291
No.

49:34.374 --> 49:36.293
That's cold, Earl.

49:40.755 --> 49:43.925
Where's that Pedro
and that damn truck?

50:27.052 --> 50:30.263
Something ate it!

50:30.347 --> 50:32.933
ln two minutes?

50:33.016 --> 50:36.478
Well, somethin' happened to it,
'cause there is nothin' left inside.

50:42.734 --> 50:46.947
Something came out of it.
What do you mean,
something came out of it?

50:47.030 --> 50:50.450
It did that thing that things do
when they change, you know--

50:50.533 --> 50:52.452
there's a word
for it, uh--

50:52.535 --> 50:56.706
It turned into something else
like a caterpillar does.

50:56.790 --> 51:00.585
Only I bet that whatever came out
wasn't no sweet little butterfly.

51:07.676 --> 51:10.595
Damn worms never
cut you any slack.

51:13.431 --> 51:16.184
I said you all ought to
head out to Rioverde.

51:16.268 --> 51:20.146
Clear out 'til we know
what's going on. Over.

51:24.317 --> 51:27.320
Kate, did you
get any of that? Over.

51:30.782 --> 51:33.034
Shit! Now, what?

51:33.118 --> 51:36.329
The radio's out. How could that be?
I was just talking to her.

51:40.000 --> 51:42.794
Man! You know
what that is, don't you?

51:42.877 --> 51:45.589
Yeah. Another one's
doing it.

51:49.384 --> 51:51.344
There! There's Pedro!

51:55.348 --> 51:58.852
'Bout damn time.

52:04.774 --> 52:07.402
- He stopped.
- He stopped?

52:07.485 --> 52:10.238
Maybe he's taking a leak?

52:16.828 --> 52:19.414
That's a long leak.

52:20.540 --> 52:23.335
Hey, Pedro! Pedro!

52:31.927 --> 52:35.430
Well

52:35.513 --> 52:38.600
maybe we should go over
and see what's wrong.

52:38.683 --> 52:42.854
Go over? You mean, walk a mile
across open county?

52:44.189 --> 52:48.318
I'm not going six
feet from that seismo.

52:48.401 --> 52:51.905
Come on. There's no graboids
anywhere near us right now.

52:54.241 --> 52:57.452
Now, I say we go
while the going's good.

53:03.833 --> 53:06.920
You know, you could
cary some of this stuff.

53:08.213 --> 53:10.131
I got what I want.

53:16.763 --> 53:20.225
Well, I can't
say this looks good.

53:25.605 --> 53:27.566
Pedro?

53:28.817 --> 53:30.777
Hey, Pedro!

53:32.654 --> 53:35.156
Man!

53:35.240 --> 53:37.701
This brings
back memories.

53:50.797 --> 53:55.135
Jesus! Looks like somebody
took a can opener to the thing.

53:56.803 --> 53:58.722
Oh, man!
Look at that engine.

53:58.805 --> 54:00.724
It's torn to pieces.

54:04.895 --> 54:07.480
Pedro!

54:07.564 --> 54:10.483
Damn it!
Where are you?

54:16.489 --> 54:18.450
Hey! There he is!

54:20.702 --> 54:23.079
Pedro?

54:23.163 --> 54:25.081
Oh, God!

54:25.165 --> 54:27.292
Oh, God!

54:29.252 --> 54:32.130
Whoa! It's a whole
new ball game.

54:32.214 --> 54:34.216
A whole new
goddam ball game.

54:34.299 --> 54:36.885
Well-- Well, you know
what to do, right?

54:36.968 --> 54:39.888
Right?
I don't know shit!

54:42.349 --> 54:44.935
Okay? Okay?

54:45.018 --> 54:47.979
We can hike over
to that radio tower.

54:48.063 --> 54:52.609
Th-Th-They've gotta
have a radio that's working.
We can, uh-- We can call direct.

55:05.038 --> 55:08.959
1 4 May. 1 900 hours.

55:09.042 --> 55:12.379
I've been out of radio contact
for several hours,

55:12.462 --> 55:16.716
unable to reach Grady and Earl
or anybody at H.Q.

55:20.262 --> 55:23.223
The situation dictates
that I return to base.

55:47.664 --> 55:49.624
A further mystery:

55:49.708 --> 55:53.044
I've not had a single
seismic reading in hours,

55:53.128 --> 55:56.756
yet I tracked one
of the sightless brutes
right into this valley.

55:58.133 --> 56:01.469
Where the hell did he go?

56:01.553 --> 56:03.471
They do get smarter.

56:03.555 --> 56:05.473
ls it possible he learned...

56:05.557 --> 56:11.146
to avoid the unique sound
of my deuce-and-half's
mil-spec engine?

56:11.229 --> 56:14.941
I do not have the answer
at this time.

56:22.741 --> 56:26.036
Oh, no, no, no. Don't tell me
that's the radio stuff.

56:26.119 --> 56:29.080
I can't believe this.

56:31.583 --> 56:36.755
Oh, man!
Can't we ever
get a goddam break?

56:36.838 --> 56:39.382
If we get outta here alive,
I'll count that as a break.

56:39.466 --> 56:42.260
I mean, there wasn't
even any people here to eat.

56:42.344 --> 56:46.348
They're doing this
on purpose, man.

56:46.431 --> 56:49.226
They're cuttin' us off
on purpose!

56:49.309 --> 56:53.396
shh! shh!
Quiet! Quiet!

56:53.480 --> 56:56.316
I told you
they get smarter.

57:01.655 --> 57:03.990
Hey, look.

57:05.784 --> 57:08.620
Oh, yes! Yes!

57:08.703 --> 57:10.789
It's not gonna have a key.

57:10.872 --> 57:14.709
So I'll hot-wire the damn thing.
I like that.

57:28.390 --> 57:30.559
Grady! Grady!

57:30.642 --> 57:33.895
What is that? I don't know,
but it's comin' this way.

57:48.868 --> 57:52.539
Jesus? How big is this thing?

58:08.680 --> 58:10.599
What the hell is that?

58:17.022 --> 58:19.441
ls that it?

58:19.524 --> 58:22.277
Sure ain't no damn ostrich.

58:22.360 --> 58:27.282
How does a 30-foot worm
turn into that little thing?
Shh! Might hear us.

58:39.419 --> 58:42.047
Shit! It heard us.

58:49.095 --> 58:51.014
Wait.

58:52.474 --> 58:54.434
We got it!

58:55.685 --> 58:57.604
We got it!

59:08.949 --> 59:10.867
Ugly little toad.

59:12.661 --> 59:14.579
No eyes.

59:14.663 --> 59:17.457
Wow!
Just like the big ones.

59:18.625 --> 59:23.213
Earl, man. We oughta
take this one with us.

59:23.296 --> 59:25.549
You crazy?
What?

59:29.844 --> 59:32.806
Sounds like a bunch of them!

59:35.058 --> 59:37.561
Come on, man t
Let's go t Let's go t

59:37.644 --> 59:40.063
- I'm tryin'! I'm tryin'!
- Let's 'go! '

01:00:32.449 --> 01:00:35.744
Pedro. Can you hear me?

01:00:35.827 --> 01:00:37.954
Earl, come on!
Talk to me.

01:00:39.372 --> 01:00:42.083
Burt? Anybody?

01:00:42.167 --> 01:00:45.086
God! What the hell
is going on?

01:00:49.716 --> 01:00:51.635
Oh, man!
Hey!

01:00:51.718 --> 01:00:55.513
Julio, man, you
scared me half to death!
Sorry.

01:00:55.597 --> 01:00:58.808
Oh, shit.
You know the radios-- They're out?

01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:01.144
I know. That's what
I've been doin' here.

01:01:01.228 --> 01:01:03.647
I think the repeater towers
are down.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:06.524
How can that be?
I don't know.

01:01:06.608 --> 01:01:08.526
Something
coming our way?

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:13.198
No! The creatures have completely
disappeared off the screen. It's weird.

01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:16.910
With the radios all out,
shouldn't everybody come back?

01:01:16.993 --> 01:01:19.704
Yeah, everybody should have
been here a long time ago.

01:01:19.788 --> 01:01:22.624
I don't like this.
This is not good.

01:01:22.707 --> 01:01:25.126
Okay, stay here
with the seismos.

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:27.546
I'm going to go look for them
right now.

01:01:27.629 --> 01:01:30.590
Okay, but--

01:01:31.758 --> 01:01:34.261
Oh, my God!

01:01:40.767 --> 01:01:42.686
Oh, no!

01:01:44.688 --> 01:01:47.065
No! No!

01:02:12.465 --> 01:02:14.384
Get him!

01:02:14.467 --> 01:02:17.387
Get him!

01:02:19.264 --> 01:02:21.182
Bastards?

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:27.272
Kate!
What are they?

01:02:27.355 --> 01:02:30.233
We don't know.
The worms change somehow.

01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:35.071
Now we've got these things.
Julio! Julio!
They-- They--

01:02:35.155 --> 01:02:38.408
- I know. I know.
- We got them, though.
We just blew 'em away?

01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:40.619
Pedro! Did Pedro find you?

01:02:40.702 --> 01:02:44.039
No. They jumped his truck.
He's dead too.

01:02:48.335 --> 01:02:50.879
Have you seen Burt?
Did he get back?

01:02:50.962 --> 01:02:56.635
No. I tried to call him. I tried you.
The radio-- Uh, excuse me.

01:02:56.718 --> 01:02:59.971
But I think
we should get goin'.

01:03:00.055 --> 01:03:02.724
You okay?
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:03:10.315 --> 01:03:12.984
- Oh, no!
- Not again!

01:03:24.913 --> 01:03:30.126
They wrecked our car,
Pedro's truck, the radio tower.
How can they be so smart?

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:32.420
Let's get
our butts inside.

01:03:34.714 --> 01:03:36.633
What the hell
we gonna do?

01:03:36.716 --> 01:03:40.804
Get these windows shut!
It's like they got
the whole thing planned.

01:03:40.887 --> 01:03:44.975
Grady! Grady! Come on!
All right. How many
do you think there are?

01:03:45.058 --> 01:03:46.977
All right,
I remember. I remember.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.939
There was three big sacks,
or bags, in that one
we saw split open.

01:03:51.022 --> 01:03:55.068
Huh, Earl? Can't be more
than three of those things
in each worm.

01:03:55.151 --> 01:03:57.445
Yeah, I-- I--
That's right, I guess.

01:03:57.529 --> 01:04:00.282
Kate, how many big worms
were left out there?

01:04:00.365 --> 01:04:03.660
You killed all but eight
graboids. I was watching.

01:04:03.743 --> 01:04:07.581
So if all eight of them changed,
that would make, uh--

01:04:07.664 --> 01:04:09.708
Twenty-four!
Twenty-four
of those things left!

01:04:09.791 --> 01:04:12.544
How many have you killed?
Well, let's see--

01:04:12.627 --> 01:04:16.214
We, uh-- We killed
one on the radio tower
and-- and one out there...

01:04:16.298 --> 01:04:19.050
and, um, on top of the car.

01:04:19.134 --> 01:04:22.637
That's it?
Well, I'm sorry.

01:04:22.721 --> 01:04:26.266
No. It's just that I mean--

01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:28.268
Oh, man!
Now what?

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:33.148
Thank God, it's Burt.

01:04:35.609 --> 01:04:38.028
Yes!
They didn't get him.

01:04:52.959 --> 01:04:54.878
I think they did get him.

01:05:09.809 --> 01:05:11.770
Burt t

01:05:13.688 --> 01:05:15.649
Burt, you okay?

01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:19.569
Burt?

01:05:20.946 --> 01:05:24.324
I feel I was denied...

01:05:24.407 --> 01:05:29.871
critical, need-to-know
information.

01:05:31.248 --> 01:05:33.166
Well, we're sorry, Burt.

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:37.295
They just changed
all of a sudden, man.

01:05:37.379 --> 01:05:41.675
We would have warned you,
but they knocked out
the radio tower.

01:05:43.176 --> 01:05:45.095
Come on, Burt!
What happened?

01:05:45.178 --> 01:05:48.890
Well, when the radios
went out,

01:05:48.974 --> 01:05:51.476
I decided to return
to the refiney.

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:56.856
But en route, I find
I'm in an ambush situation.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.568
Must have been a couple
of dozen of these things!

01:05:59.651 --> 01:06:05.282
I dropped the first wave
with semiauto fire,
but they just kept coming.

01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:10.287
Most were in front of the truck,
so I popped it in six-wheel
and ran 'em down.

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:13.415
The ones that got on board,
I handled with a combination...

01:06:13.498 --> 01:06:16.835
of small arms fire
and hand-to-hand techniques.

01:06:20.547 --> 01:06:24.467
I am completely out of ammo.

01:06:29.848 --> 01:06:31.766
That's never
happened to me before.

01:06:31.850 --> 01:06:34.811
Well, shit!
Who cares, Burt?

01:06:34.895 --> 01:06:37.480
Sounds like you
killed 'em all, huh?

01:06:37.564 --> 01:06:40.984
I hope not.
These creatures
are very important.

01:06:43.153 --> 01:06:46.448
You know,
I mean scientifically.

01:06:46.531 --> 01:06:48.783
That fact was
not lost on me.

01:06:48.867 --> 01:06:52.954
When it was all over,
I saw one of the little
S.O.B.s was just stunned.

01:06:55.081 --> 01:06:57.167
So I detained him.

01:07:29.658 --> 01:07:32.118
Oh, man,
it's drooling.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.541
Don't let him spook ya.

01:07:37.624 --> 01:07:41.002
That line
is 1 ,000-pound test.

01:07:46.633 --> 01:07:49.219
Go on.
Haul him out of there.

01:07:53.098 --> 01:07:55.016
Hold on to
that son of a bitch!

01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.018
I'll get the door.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:18.099
I knew it.
Infrared.

01:09:18.183 --> 01:09:21.060
It doesn't hear us;
it doesn't actually see us;

01:09:21.144 --> 01:09:24.231
it senses the heat
of our bodies.

01:09:24.314 --> 01:09:28.276
See that?
The thing that rises up
must be the heat sensor.

01:09:39.746 --> 01:09:43.291
You feel that?

01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:46.336
Gives off a lot of heat
when it screams.

01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:55.554
That's it.

01:09:55.637 --> 01:09:59.015
I bet that's the way
they communicate.

01:09:59.099 --> 01:10:01.184
The sound doesn't matter.

01:10:01.268 --> 01:10:05.230
They make noise,
but they signal each other
with their body heat.

01:10:05.313 --> 01:10:09.192
It only sees heat?
Yes, that's not so weird.

01:10:09.276 --> 01:10:11.695
A rattlesnake
strikes at body heat.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.075
That's why
they tore up the cars--
because the engines were hot.

01:10:17.158 --> 01:10:19.703
They thought it was food.

01:10:19.786 --> 01:10:22.205
And the same thing
with the radio tower.

01:10:22.289 --> 01:10:24.916
That electronic gear
puts off all kinds of heat.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.711
So basically, they bite
anything that's warm.

01:10:27.794 --> 01:10:30.505
They been actin' so smart
'cause they're so stupid?

01:10:44.019 --> 01:10:46.855
Now, that's not warm.
How does he know to eat that?

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:49.399
Well, it tastes it
with its tongue.

01:10:49.482 --> 01:10:52.777
See how he's draggin'
his tongue all over.

01:10:52.861 --> 01:10:54.863
Touches anything
he likes, uh,

01:10:54.946 --> 01:10:57.824
he eats it.

01:10:57.908 --> 01:11:00.410
How much can he eat?
Those M.R.E.s aren't cheap,
you know.

01:11:06.875 --> 01:11:08.752
Looks like he's had enough.

01:11:08.835 --> 01:11:11.922
You're feeding it too much!
You made it sick.

01:11:12.005 --> 01:11:15.175
Give me a break.
Probably your nasty food
made it sick.

01:11:37.572 --> 01:11:39.699
Oh, good God!

01:12:03.723 --> 01:12:05.642
Hermaphrodites.

01:12:12.816 --> 01:12:15.569
They reproduce
without having sex.

01:12:16.778 --> 01:12:20.365
I  claim the little one.
Hey, it was my food!

01:12:20.448 --> 01:12:24.703
Whenever one of them gets
enough food, they just bla-a-ah,
and there's another one.

01:12:24.786 --> 01:12:27.789
Then one makes two,
two makes four,

01:12:27.873 --> 01:12:30.000
four makes eight--
It's exponential.

01:12:30.083 --> 01:12:34.838
Well, uh, hell.
That gives 'em quite an edge.

01:12:34.921 --> 01:12:37.591
You never see this
in higher animals. Ever!

01:12:37.674 --> 01:12:39.593
It's astounding.

01:12:39.676 --> 01:12:41.595
Don't you guys get it?

01:12:41.678 --> 01:12:44.222
Oh, we get it.
We just don't want it.

01:12:44.681 --> 01:12:46.224
The little one's
getting big already.

01:12:46.308 --> 01:12:48.226
Uh, I think we better
think about leaving.

01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:52.147
These guys have taken
a completely different
evolutionary path.

01:13:01.823 --> 01:13:05.869
They got into your damn
super-food, Burt!

01:13:05.952 --> 01:13:07.871
Go! Go!

01:13:07.954 --> 01:13:10.582
Yeah! Yeah!

01:13:10.665 --> 01:13:13.335
The warehouse! We
gotta close the warehouse!

01:13:13.418 --> 01:13:15.795
oh! oh!

01:13:16.963 --> 01:13:19.674
This way!
Grady! No!

01:13:19.758 --> 01:13:22.761
No! Not that way!
Grady!

01:13:24.137 --> 01:13:26.389
Grady, damn it!

01:13:26.473 --> 01:13:29.768
All right! All right!
This isn't gonna work.

01:13:29.851 --> 01:13:32.395
Shit!

01:13:45.659 --> 01:13:47.577
They stopped.

01:13:47.661 --> 01:13:50.956
They're just milling around.

01:13:51.039 --> 01:13:53.833
Looks like they
lost track of us.
That's not gonna last.

01:13:55.460 --> 01:13:58.547
We're like
sittin' ducks here!

01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.091
Well, it looked like
a goddam building!

01:14:01.174 --> 01:14:05.762
Why didn't you listen to me?
These little snappers
are blind and deaf.

01:14:05.845 --> 01:14:07.889
We've gotta
be able to beat them.

01:14:34.207 --> 01:14:37.627
I told ya,
they can't see us.

01:14:37.711 --> 01:14:40.839
Great, now what?
Now, move with me.

01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:43.133
Move?

01:14:43.216 --> 01:14:46.511
It's gonna work, damn it.
Now move! And step, and step,

01:14:46.595 --> 01:14:51.391
and step and step--
I don't know how you
come up with this shit.

01:14:51.474 --> 01:14:53.977
I think on my feet.

01:14:54.060 --> 01:14:55.979
Come on! It's working.

01:14:56.062 --> 01:15:00.108
Comin' at ya.
Okay. All right.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:02.569
And down.

01:15:13.163 --> 01:15:16.333
So...

01:15:16.416 --> 01:15:19.127
where are we going?

01:15:20.587 --> 01:15:22.505
Are there
any more cars left?

01:15:22.589 --> 01:15:24.674
Um, uh, yeah.

01:15:24.758 --> 01:15:28.803
One. Julio's.
It's by the storage tank.

01:15:28.887 --> 01:15:32.057
- Which way?
- Left. Move left.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:36.436
Okay. Ready and moving left,

01:15:36.519 --> 01:15:41.191
and step, and step, and step,

01:15:41.274 --> 01:15:43.985
and step and step.

01:15:49.324 --> 01:15:51.284
Okay, it's
not much further.

01:15:53.119 --> 01:15:55.288
oh!

01:15:57.290 --> 01:15:59.459
There's one
of them out there!

01:15:59.543 --> 01:16:02.462
Oh, shit!
Did it see you?

01:16:02.546 --> 01:16:06.675
Well, if it had, I think
we'd be hearing about it by now.

01:16:06.758 --> 01:16:08.677
How far is it?

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:11.304
Uh, uh, 100 yards about.

01:16:11.388 --> 01:16:14.266
That's a heck of a shot.

01:16:14.349 --> 01:16:16.560
Uh-huh.

01:16:16.643 --> 01:16:19.729
Whoa! You got
only one shot?
Then you gotta hit it...

01:16:19.813 --> 01:16:24.401
before it sends one of those
heat signals to the others.

01:16:24.484 --> 01:16:26.653
I know.

01:16:33.785 --> 01:16:35.704
Cover your ears.

01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:50.510
Oh,Jesus.

01:16:52.262 --> 01:16:54.472
Jesus!

01:16:54.556 --> 01:16:57.976
God! You smoked his ass.

01:16:58.059 --> 01:17:01.313
Doin' what I can with what I got.
Good.

01:17:11.573 --> 01:17:13.533
Oh, shit, partner.

01:17:17.621 --> 01:17:19.581
Oh, no! Pop the hood.

01:17:20.874 --> 01:17:22.834
I got it, I got it.

01:17:22.918 --> 01:17:24.878
Damn!

01:17:26.379 --> 01:17:28.673
We're dead.

01:17:32.802 --> 01:17:34.888
What?

01:17:34.971 --> 01:17:37.265
I didn't know.
How could I've known?

01:17:39.392 --> 01:17:43.480
We're supposed to be
up against graboids!
I wanted maximum penetration.

01:17:43.563 --> 01:17:45.815
- Well, you've got it.
- Now what?

01:17:45.899 --> 01:17:49.069
We can't stay here.
We've got to get inside.

01:17:50.111 --> 01:17:52.113
uh,

01:17:52.197 --> 01:17:54.115
Cantina!

01:18:11.591 --> 01:18:13.426
Damn!

01:18:34.406 --> 01:18:38.410
Burt?

01:18:38.493 --> 01:18:40.412
Uh-oh!

01:18:40.495 --> 01:18:42.581
Burt!

01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:48.587
Oh, no, Burt!

01:19:24.206 --> 01:19:28.752
Burt, it's working; they can't find you.
Don't move.

01:19:28.835 --> 01:19:33.215
Good! Good idea.

01:19:39.721 --> 01:19:41.681
This is pathetic!

01:19:43.183 --> 01:19:46.144
Wait a minute! I've
got a plan, I think!

01:19:48.021 --> 01:19:51.399
Earl! Earl!

01:19:51.483 --> 01:19:54.402
Yeah, I know! I know.
I just need another second.

01:20:14.172 --> 01:20:17.092
Ow! Ow!
Shit! Ouch!

01:20:18.426 --> 01:20:23.014
That's great!
Uh, here. Here.

01:20:24.808 --> 01:20:26.726
Get ready to run.

01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:29.312
We're gonna head for those
oil towers and climb.

01:20:44.744 --> 01:20:47.581
Yes! Earl,
you're a genius.

01:20:50.208 --> 01:20:52.836
Come on!
It's clear. Hurry.

01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:58.967
You're okay.
They can't climb.

01:20:59.050 --> 01:21:01.386
Watch your shin.
Oh, man!

01:21:01.469 --> 01:21:04.890
They can't climb.
Pretty slick, my man.

01:21:04.973 --> 01:21:07.225
Slick?
That was brilliant.

01:21:07.309 --> 01:21:09.519
You really do think
on your feet, don't you?

01:21:09.603 --> 01:21:11.521
Yeah, well.

01:21:12.772 --> 01:21:14.691
Hey, where's Burt?

01:21:14.774 --> 01:21:18.820
Oh, over here.
And don't worry, they can't
even find him in there.

01:21:18.904 --> 01:21:21.865
Oh, man.
I think he's gonna
be okay for now.

01:21:27.412 --> 01:21:30.081
Oh, I'm just dandy!

01:21:30.165 --> 01:21:32.500
So what do we do now?

01:21:35.921 --> 01:21:38.215
Hey, Burt!

01:21:38.298 --> 01:21:42.302
Are you sure you don't
have any more bullets?
Did you check all your pockets?

01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:50.060
You know, as I lie here,
I can't help but comment:

01:21:50.143 --> 01:21:55.106
The reason I am out
of nine millimetre rounds
is I was not properly briefed.

01:21:55.190 --> 01:21:59.694
And the reason
for that is this mission
was not properly researched.

01:21:59.778 --> 01:22:03.657
If certain people had bothered
to gather intelligence
on the creatures...

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:06.076
before bumbling
into the situation--

01:22:06.159 --> 01:22:09.371
Knock it off, Burt!
Nobody made you come.

01:22:09.454 --> 01:22:14.334
when we should be packing
full-auto, preferably belt-fed!

01:22:14.417 --> 01:22:17.379
Shut up!

01:22:17.462 --> 01:22:23.051
They're Precambrian life forms.
How's anybody supposed to
research Precambrian life?

01:22:23.134 --> 01:22:25.595
What difference
does it make now?

01:22:25.679 --> 01:22:29.558
We're stuck on a goddam roof
with a bunch of whatsits
tying to eat us.

01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:32.435
I've done this before,
and I did not like it.

01:22:32.519 --> 01:22:37.148
Okay. It's all my fault!
So things didn't work out
exactly the way we planned.

01:22:37.232 --> 01:22:39.401
If I had the right tools,
I'd finish the job!

01:22:39.484 --> 01:22:42.988
Jeez! Would you
just all relax?

01:22:43.071 --> 01:22:48.118
Now, look. Nobody's
heard from us since last night,

01:22:48.201 --> 01:22:52.956
which means pretty soon
they're going to be up here
looking for us, right?

01:22:53.039 --> 01:22:58.378
So all we have to do
is sit and wait. Okay?

01:23:02.132 --> 01:23:04.092
Burt?

01:23:07.304 --> 01:23:09.222
Okay.

01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:41.171
So I figured I wanted to learn
some Spanish, and six months in
Mexico would be an adventure.

01:23:46.092 --> 01:23:49.095
So, uh--

01:23:50.180 --> 01:23:52.098
Seeing anybody?

01:23:57.896 --> 01:24:01.066
Not since
the monsters arrived.

01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:05.487
Well, you know, you...

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:09.199
spend a couple of days
almost getting killed,
you start, uh,

01:24:09.282 --> 01:24:11.493
thinking about your future
and--

01:24:11.576 --> 01:24:14.412
Thinking you
should date more?

01:24:14.496 --> 01:24:17.123
Well, uh,
yeah, actually.

01:24:19.209 --> 01:24:22.045
Uh, look, uh,

01:24:22.128 --> 01:24:26.049
I just don't meet that many
women who can keep their cool...

01:24:26.132 --> 01:24:28.176
in a situation like this.

01:24:30.011 --> 01:24:35.100
What I mean is that, uh--
What matters to me is that
a woman can handle herself.

01:24:35.183 --> 01:24:37.185
It's much more important
than what she looks like.

01:24:37.269 --> 01:24:41.147
Thanks a lot. Aw, come on!
You look great.

01:24:42.482 --> 01:24:46.069
Enough guys have told you that.
Yeah, well.

01:24:46.152 --> 01:24:49.072
Believe it or not, I made my living
as a model once upon a time.

01:24:49.155 --> 01:24:51.074
I put myself
through college.

01:24:51.157 --> 01:24:53.243
I believe it.
I was a--

01:24:53.326 --> 01:24:57.122
I was even a Playmate once.

01:24:57.205 --> 01:25:01.042
About gave my dad
a heart attack.

01:25:03.503 --> 01:25:07.257
What?
October '74?

01:25:07.340 --> 01:25:10.635
Shit!

01:25:17.142 --> 01:25:19.436
Yup!

01:25:20.145 --> 01:25:23.231
Uh, guys. Guys!

01:25:23.315 --> 01:25:27.402
Oh, my God.
Look at that.

01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:37.120
Goddam little...
heat seekers.

01:25:37.204 --> 01:25:40.290
What do we do, Earl?
You gotta stop asking me?

01:25:40.373 --> 01:25:43.919
I don't know!
What's goin' on?

01:25:44.002 --> 01:25:45.921
What's happening?

01:25:56.389 --> 01:25:58.308
Uh-oh.

01:26:00.352 --> 01:26:03.271
Smart little bastards.

01:26:03.355 --> 01:26:05.273
Whoa! Oh!

01:26:18.245 --> 01:26:20.956
Come get me, you suckers!
You hungry?

01:26:21.039 --> 01:26:24.000
- A hundred and eighty-five
pounds of lean meat.
- Burt, what are you doing?

01:26:24.084 --> 01:26:26.002
You know you want it!

01:26:28.088 --> 01:26:30.715
Burt!
Burt!

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:35.887
What is wrong with him?
Has he got a plan?

01:26:35.971 --> 01:26:39.474
Burt's always got a plan...
usually.

01:26:48.275 --> 01:26:50.193
Yes!

01:26:57.117 --> 01:26:59.035
Problem solved.

01:26:59.119 --> 01:27:02.497
You maniac!

01:27:02.581 --> 01:27:04.708
Who-oo! Oh, Burt, you did it?

01:27:04.791 --> 01:27:07.127
You tricked
the little plug uglies!

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:10.589
How's it feel
to be so stupid?

01:27:12.632 --> 01:27:14.801
Who-oo!

01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:21.516
Oh, Christ!
Did they find something to eat?

01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:26.396
- Uh, what's in there, Kate?
- I don't know--
boxes, supplies.

01:27:26.479 --> 01:27:29.733
Golosinas--
Dulce.

01:27:29.816 --> 01:27:32.903
Hell, uh--
Dulce. Dulce.

01:27:32.986 --> 01:27:36.531
Sweet! Golosinas--
I know this one. Snack.

01:27:36.615 --> 01:27:40.160
Sweet snack food?

01:27:40.243 --> 01:27:42.370
Rice flour.

01:27:42.746 --> 01:27:46.124
I didn't know!
How could I've had known?

01:27:46.208 --> 01:27:48.752
- God! Don't they ever get tired of eating?
- There'll be 100 of 'em.

01:27:48.835 --> 01:27:51.546
- Okay, we're gonna run for it!
- What?

01:27:51.630 --> 01:27:53.673
Where?
We're not gonna make it!

01:27:53.757 --> 01:27:57.260
Look? Earl, I'm sorry.

01:27:57.344 --> 01:28:00.096
I'm sorry I got you all into this.
Come on, Grady.

01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.141
We ain't dead yet.

01:28:05.727 --> 01:28:08.396
Okay! Come on!

01:28:08.480 --> 01:28:10.565
Okay, what, what,
what, what, okay?

01:28:10.649 --> 01:28:13.068
Uh, I've got a plan!
Sorta.

01:28:16.655 --> 01:28:18.698
You're gonna
squirt me with this.

01:28:18.782 --> 01:28:21.826
- That's great! It'll make you cold.
- Right. They won't see me.

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:24.746
Says who? No, they're
right; it oughta work.

01:28:24.829 --> 01:28:26.998
For how long?
Well, we gotta try something!

01:28:27.082 --> 01:28:32.337
- But what is the point?
- If I can just get to your
truck, I can grab some bombs.

01:28:32.420 --> 01:28:36.091
- This is nuts!
- Well, yeah, and--

01:28:36.174 --> 01:28:38.510
Let me do it!
It was my idea!

01:28:38.593 --> 01:28:42.639
No, I got you all into this.
It's my fault.
I'm going in. Spray me!

01:28:42.722 --> 01:28:46.434
We gotta do it
before they break out.
Now, blast me!

01:28:47.852 --> 01:28:50.897
Oh,Jesus!

01:28:50.981 --> 01:28:53.900
- Yes!
- No! Rock rips through paper.

01:28:53.984 --> 01:28:57.904
Huh! I go! Give me that shirt.
I need the gloves too.

01:28:59.698 --> 01:29:02.701
You ready?
Here goes.

01:29:20.302 --> 01:29:22.512
Man, this stuff is cold!

01:29:22.596 --> 01:29:24.556
Okay, here goes.

01:29:24.639 --> 01:29:27.475
Lock this door behind me.
Lock it?

01:29:27.559 --> 01:29:31.730
Yeah. I'll get the bombs
and go out the other door.

01:29:31.813 --> 01:29:33.857
All right.

01:30:11.686 --> 01:30:14.022
Sounds like it's working.

01:30:18.276 --> 01:30:20.862
I can't see anything.
Over here.

01:30:33.875 --> 01:30:35.835
Here!

01:30:37.045 --> 01:30:39.756
Holy tamole!
There's dozens of 'em.

01:30:39.839 --> 01:30:41.758
Good Lord.

01:30:41.841 --> 01:30:47.180
Wait a minute!
Paperwraps rock, doesn't it?

01:30:47.264 --> 01:30:50.475
Paper _lw__s wraps rock.

01:30:50.559 --> 01:30:52.727
Damn!

01:31:01.528 --> 01:31:04.698
He's startin' to melt!
Earl, you're melting?

01:31:04.781 --> 01:31:08.660
Step on it!
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:31:22.048 --> 01:31:24.175
Damn! They see him.

01:31:25.927 --> 01:31:29.764
Uh... rope!
We need rope or something.

01:31:29.848 --> 01:31:33.018
Hang on, Earl!
A hose! There's a hose
down by the fire hydrant.

01:31:50.285 --> 01:31:52.454
Here you go.

01:31:56.583 --> 01:31:59.169
Ah! It's too short!

01:32:08.762 --> 01:32:11.473
Did you hear me?
The hose is too short.

01:32:11.556 --> 01:32:13.808
Burt, hurry!

01:32:24.277 --> 01:32:26.321
oh!

01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:33.286
Heads up, Earl!
Grab it! Come on!

01:32:45.215 --> 01:32:48.552
Go! Run! Run! Go!
I set a bomb.

01:32:48.635 --> 01:32:51.972
What? It's the only
thing I could think of.

01:33:01.481 --> 01:33:04.568
Kate, what did he do?
Grady? Come on!

01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:08.572
Where the hell are the bombs?
I didn't have time.
I just threw one in your truck.

01:33:08.655 --> 01:33:10.866
You what?

01:33:10.949 --> 01:33:13.994
That's two-and-a-half tons
of high explosives!

01:33:14.077 --> 01:33:17.247
You sayin' that's not enough?
God, Burt! Don't tell me
it's not enough!

01:33:17.330 --> 01:33:20.041
Not enough! Never mind.
Never mind. Just run!

01:33:20.125 --> 01:33:22.043
Faster!

01:33:25.589 --> 01:33:28.341
No, no, no! Keep going.
It's gonna be big.

01:33:28.425 --> 01:33:30.927
Big t
Is he serious?

01:33:31.011 --> 01:33:33.763
Uh, Burt knows his bombs.
How big can it be?

01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:37.851
How long did you set it for?

01:33:37.934 --> 01:33:40.770
I don't know;
I just pushed it.

01:33:40.854 --> 01:33:43.648
God, it's going to be big.
Big!

01:33:53.825 --> 01:33:59.456
All right, this will have to do.
Get down; stay down; cover
your ears. It's gonna be b _i!

01:33:59.539 --> 01:34:03.376
- Is it gonna be today?
- Grady, get your ass down!

01:34:11.593 --> 01:34:13.553
oh!

01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.500
Hey, Grady. Grady.
Grady, you all right, man?

01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.379
You okay?

01:34:47.462 --> 01:34:50.924
Yeah. Thanks.

01:34:51.007 --> 01:34:54.511
oh!
Watch yourselves.

01:35:12.779 --> 01:35:14.739
Whew!

01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:28.211
Wow!

01:35:28.295 --> 01:35:30.672
Wow!

01:35:30.755 --> 01:35:35.844
You know, Grady. Some people
think I'm overprepared.

01:35:35.927 --> 01:35:38.263
Paranoid.

01:35:38.346 --> 01:35:41.308
Maybe even
a little crazy.

01:35:41.391 --> 01:35:45.270
But they never met any Precambrian
life forms, did they?

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:55.322
Uh, look, uh--
I don't mind hangin'
around down here for awhile.

01:35:55.405 --> 01:35:57.324
Gonna have any free time?

01:35:57.407 --> 01:36:02.120
Well, spend a couple days
almost gettin' killed,

01:36:02.204 --> 01:36:05.165
you start
thinkin' about your future.

01:36:06.833 --> 01:36:09.753
Thinkin' you
should date more?

01:36:09.836 --> 01:36:12.964
Well, yeah, actually.

01:36:13.048 --> 01:36:17.594
Hey, Earl, I just realized
they owe us for 28 worms, man.

01:36:18.678 --> 01:36:21.223
Hey, that's right.
We didn't die.

01:36:23.016 --> 01:36:25.727
Although, we did kinda
blow up their refiney.

01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:28.897
Hey, that's just
part of the job.

01:36:28.980 --> 01:36:31.816
ln fact, we oughta charge them
for all those little ones too.

01:36:31.900 --> 01:36:36.488
Oh, yeah. We'll have enough
to start our own theme park--

01:36:36.571 --> 01:36:38.698
Grady and Earl's
Monster World.

01:36:38.782 --> 01:36:40.700
Hey, no way!

01:36:40.784 --> 01:36:44.204
Come on, Earl. This could
be like your big, third chance.
