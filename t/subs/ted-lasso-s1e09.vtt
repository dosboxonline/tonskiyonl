00:06.840 --> 00:09.051
Lisa Cramlin here with Graham Paul,

00:09.134 --> 00:12.137
breaking down this afternoon's
Richmond-Arsenal match.

00:12.221 --> 00:14.389
-Welcome, Graham.
-Pleasure to be here, Lisa.

00:14.473 --> 00:19.895
So today was another tough day
for Roy Kent in a stretch of bad days.

00:19.978 --> 00:22.481
In his last nine games, Kent has had...

00:23.440 --> 00:25.776
...while his turnovers
have nearly doubled.

00:25.859 --> 00:29.696
And today, it was an ignominious
own goal...

00:29.780 --> 00:30.781
There you are.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.031
Everyone gone?

00:32.115 --> 00:34.243
Yes, sir. Well, except Rojas.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.870
Darn kid's out on the practice pitch
still doing drills.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.497
What a fucking asshole.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.915
-Right?
-Yeah.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.045
Somebody order a Roy on the rocks, huh?

00:45.128 --> 00:46.421
How we doing in here?

00:47.047 --> 00:48.632
That is cold, man.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.510
Just looking at you in there
is making me all chilly inside.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.597
Can you just tell me I fucked up
and then go?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.766
Not gonna do that, bud.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.060
I lost us the game. I'm a piece of shit.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.021
Easy now. You had a bad day. Big whoop.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.355
"Big whoop"?

01:04.438 --> 01:05.774
Yeah, big whoop.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.778
You beating yourself up is like
Woody Allen playing the clarinet.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.822
I don't wanna hear it. All right?

01:12.489 --> 01:17.035
So just, you know, knock it off.
Go easy on yourself. Okay?

01:18.328 --> 01:21.707
Hey. I got your back.
Ain't nothing gonna change that.

01:22.749 --> 01:25.419
Look at you in there, looking like
a brunette Oscar the Grouch.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.130
-On or off?
-Off.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.302
You gotta stop holding on, Roy,
please, for us, for you.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.595
Let it go.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.096
-There you go.
-Hola, Roy.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.015
We're taking a break. When we return,

01:38.098 --> 01:41.810
we'll take a look at Jamie Tartt's
brilliant day for Manchester City.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.636
That's it. Right there. Yep. Beautiful.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.099
Oh, snap. Watch your back, Kate Moss.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.852
There's a new bad girl
on the British modeling scene.

02:23.936 --> 02:26.647
-Huh? Yeah?
-Okay, I think we've got it.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.358
Brought these in case
you need a little biscuit boost. Yeah?

02:33.278 --> 02:35.948
Man, oh, man.
You get nervous doing this kind of stuff?

02:36.031 --> 02:38.450
It's a profile on women in football.
It's not a big deal.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.787
There's, like, four of us:
me, Karen, Delia and Posh Spice.

02:41.870 --> 02:44.206
Come on, now.
Being a role model's a huge deal.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.668
Don't you realize that there's probably
a little girl out there somewhere

02:47.751 --> 02:51.004
rocking a tiny eggplant-colored
power suit,

02:51.088 --> 02:54.049
and she's just dreaming about
becoming a sports executive someday.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.926
She's gonna read this article
and she's gonna think,

02:56.009 --> 03:00.180
"Holy smokes. My dreams are possible."

03:00.264 --> 03:03.976
In this scenario of yours, little girls
read The Football Financial Quarterly?

03:04.059 --> 03:05.769
Well, who knows?
Little girls are mysterious.

03:06.395 --> 03:09.565
And silly and powerful. I gave up
trying to figure them out years ago.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.025
Tell you what,
I wish Higgins was here to see this,

03:12.109 --> 03:13.944
'cause he'd be real happy for you too.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.405
I don't know about that, Ted.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.448
When Higgins decided to quit,
he made it quite clear

03:18.532 --> 03:20.367
what he thought about me,
and it wasn't supportive.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.954
Nope. I'm filing that under
stinkin' thinkin' right there. Okay?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.664
I guarantee you, he'll come around.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.583
-Right. I'm changing the subject.
-Go ahead.

03:27.666 --> 03:30.043
How's the team morale
going into the final weekend?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.921
I mean, I'm still heartbroken
about the last loss.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.506
Are you?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.341
Of course.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.802
-Hey, Keeley.
-Hi, Ted.

03:38.886 --> 03:41.722
Hey, did those marketing folks
from Tom Ford ever get back to you?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.056
Yeah, they did.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.475
They said they're gonna stick
with the models they already have.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.476
Nuts.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.936
I know. But they did say

03:48.020 --> 03:50.689
that if they ever do an everyman campaign
or something satirical,

03:50.772 --> 03:51.773
your name's on their list.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.234
All right. There you go. That's not bad.

03:54.318 --> 03:55.861
Can I borrow you for a second, Rebecca?

04:00.032 --> 04:01.033
Come on.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.956
My God, it smells of feet in here.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.292
I mean, it just hits you immediately,
doesn't it?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.879
It's hot. Like feet funk,
right up your nose. Can you smell it?

04:13.962 --> 04:16.173
You're being a right floppy cock, Rebecca.

04:16.255 --> 04:17.632
Why haven't you told Ted yet?

04:18.132 --> 04:19.134
I'm going to.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.135
When?

04:21.637 --> 04:24.139
Imagine doing something unforgivable
to someone who doesn't deserve it

04:24.223 --> 04:26.517
and then having to look them in the eye
and tell them what you've done.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.310
I don't have to imagine. I've done it.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.188
Year Eight, I took a shit
in Joanna Wellington's locker.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.648
I apologized,

04:32.731 --> 04:35.817
I was uninvited to her birthday party,
and then we patched it up a week later.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.569
Just fucking tell him.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.738
Sorry, why did you do a shit
in her locker?

04:40.155 --> 04:41.448
I don't know. I was 13.

04:42.241 --> 04:47.037
What? Teenage girls are, like,
mysterious and dark and dangerous.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.539
-All right.
-That is not the point!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.457
-Okay.
-Oh, God.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.042
Sorry. Wow.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.964
I know women like shoes,
but, girls, come on, this is silly.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.757
Sorry, that was really sexist.

04:58.841 --> 05:01.176
I just wasn't expecting there
to be anyone in here.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.761
But you are in here, and that's great.

05:02.845 --> 05:05.514
Take as long as you need.
Yeah. I'll go. Sorry.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.184
I mean, what would be the point
of telling Ted now?

05:09.268 --> 05:10.394
It doesn't change anything.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.354
It would change how I feel about you.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.822
You know, David, we got one final game
this season against Man City,

05:21.905 --> 05:24.867
and our goal is to go out
like Willie Nelson, on a high.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.159
Yeah?

05:26.243 --> 05:28.120
How about Trent Crimm?

05:28.203 --> 05:30.998
And if memory serves,
you're from the Daily Planet, yeah?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.791
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

05:32.875 --> 05:35.335
Yes. That's the one. Okay.
What's your question, Trent?

05:35.419 --> 05:38.088
Many of your young players
have improved during your tenure.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.299
Then there's Roy Kent.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.385
He played dismally last match. Thoughts?

05:43.468 --> 05:47.347
Well, I think you could ask Roy himself.
He'd tell you it wasn't his best day.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.183
But I'll let you know right now

05:49.266 --> 05:51.602
that Roy Kent is the backbone
of this team.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.520
All right,
let's mix it up in here a little.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.440
If you're an introvert,
I want y'all to raise your hand.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.358
You guys get the next few questions.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.860
That was a trick!

05:59.943 --> 06:02.654
If y'all were really introverts,
you would've been quiet as a church mouse.

06:02.738 --> 06:06.241
Unless that church was Westboro Baptist.
Those turkeys won't shut up.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.663
Hi, guys. What's up?

06:11.747 --> 06:13.040
Please have a seat.

06:13.582 --> 06:14.583
Okay.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.672
I feel like y'all are about to do
some improv comedy

06:20.756 --> 06:22.257
or tell me that you're dating each other.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.928
Either one's cool with me.
'Cause your suggestion is ally.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.138
We have to take Roy
out of the starting lineup.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.432
I see. Okay.

06:30.516 --> 06:31.767
It wasn't just one bad game, Coach.

06:31.850 --> 06:32.976
He's showing his age,

06:33.060 --> 06:35.479
and he's made significant mistakes
in each of the last five matches.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.314
We just haven't been
bitten in the ass by them yet.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.858
But yesterday our butts had teeth marks.

06:39.942 --> 06:42.903
Deep ones.
The kind you usually have to pay for.

06:54.414 --> 06:57.543
Guys... I'm not benching Roy.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.503
He's our captain.

06:59.586 --> 07:03.715
But I want you to know
that I value each of your opinions.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.260
Even when they're wrong.

07:08.053 --> 07:09.763
I was really hoping
it was going to be improv.

07:11.557 --> 07:12.891
I'm Audi 5000.

07:19.898 --> 07:22.442
-You paid someone to bite you?
-No, of course not.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.652
Sorry. I...

07:23.735 --> 07:24.736
Been paid.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.368
Where?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.163
Hey. What's up?

07:35.956 --> 07:38.041
I have something I need to tell you.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.543
I'm all ears.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.882
Right, I'm not gonna beat around the bush.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.177
I'm just gonna...
get straight to the point.

07:48.260 --> 07:49.845
No faffing around,
'cause that's just annoying,

07:49.928 --> 07:51.638
and definitely no procrastinating.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.807
Procrast-- Procrast--
That's a good word, isn't it?

07:53.891 --> 07:56.226
Procrastinating. Procrastinating.

07:56.727 --> 07:58.478
I wonder what the etymology
of that word is.

07:58.562 --> 08:02.441
Obviously, "pro," very good,
but "crast"? Crast...

08:03.150 --> 08:05.152
I have no idea.
Hey! Why don't we look it up?

08:05.235 --> 08:07.654
-Have you got a dictionary?
-Not on me. Are you doing okay?

08:08.155 --> 08:09.406
-Me?
-Yeah.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.408
I'm brilliant!

08:11.491 --> 08:13.827
Yeah, I am top of the pops.

08:16.038 --> 08:17.748
Ted, do you think you could do this later?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.375
Yeah, sure. No problem.
I'll just hit the rewind button.

08:30.886 --> 08:34.806
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

08:34.890 --> 08:36.600
Just do it. Just do it. I'm a big girl.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.727
I can fucking just--
Just tidy up your mess.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.522
Tidy up your mess. Right. Oh, God.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.525
Surprise.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.444
-Rupert.
-You seem anxious.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.737
Where's Higgins?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.155
I fired him.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.074
Why? Higgins is first class.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.743
Except the only negative about the man

08:54.826 --> 08:57.162
was that whenever
he borrowed a pen from me,

08:57.246 --> 09:00.582
he would nibble the top
like some anxious little puppy.

09:01.792 --> 09:02.793
Good boy.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.044
Yeah, well, he's gone.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.130
Shame. Oh, well.
Maybe he'll accept my offer now.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.425
Look, Rupert, are you here
to try and buy back the club or--

09:10.509 --> 09:14.346
No, I wanted to tell you something
before you heard it somewhere else.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.015
Bex and I are having a baby.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.519
Surprise, again.

09:21.854 --> 09:25.732
-But you always said that--
-I thought we could be mature about this.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.694
You're mature enough, all right.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.281
You're nearly 70,
and you're having a baby?

09:32.364 --> 09:35.242
I mean, what are you,
a character from the fucking Bible?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.952
When your kid hits puberty,

09:37.035 --> 09:39.705
you'll be nothing but a pile of dust
and a black Amex card.

09:39.788 --> 09:40.873
Now, now, darling.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.082
Don't call me that.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.751
People change. I do want a child.

09:45.419 --> 09:48.881
I just suppose I didn't want one with...

09:50.340 --> 09:51.425
Before.

09:53.177 --> 09:57.139
I mean, in the end, it's just about
being with the right person, isn't it?

10:00.559 --> 10:01.560
Of course.

10:01.643 --> 10:04.146
I'm so glad
I got to tell you this in person.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.108
I would have hated
for you to read it in the press.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.611
Good luck against Man City.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.575
I have something I need to tell you.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.453
Déjà vu.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.081
I'm a fucking bitch.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.291
Nope, that's new.

11:10.212 --> 11:11.463
Ted, I lied to you.

11:13.298 --> 11:15.884
I hired you
because I wanted this team to lose.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.345
I wanted you to fail,

11:18.428 --> 11:21.014
and I sabotaged you every chance I've had.

11:22.391 --> 11:26.562
It was me who hired that photographer
to take the photo of you and Keeley.

11:27.354 --> 11:32.568
I set up the interview with Trent Crimm,
hoping that he would humiliate you.

11:33.151 --> 11:37.030
And I instigated the transfer
of Jamie Tartt,

11:37.114 --> 11:38.740
even though you'd asked me not to.

11:40.659 --> 11:44.705
This club is all that Rupert has ever
cared about, and I wanted to destroy it.

11:45.497 --> 11:50.627
To cause him as much pain and suffering
as he has caused me.

11:51.420 --> 11:55.591
And I didn't care
who I used or who I hurt.

11:57.009 --> 12:01.221
All you good people
just trying to make a difference.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.641
Ted, I'm so sorry.

12:16.528 --> 12:19.531
If you want to quit or call the press,
I'll completely understand.

12:22.743 --> 12:23.911
I forgive you.

12:25.162 --> 12:27.122
You-- What? Why?

12:27.706 --> 12:28.957
Divorce is hard.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.544
It doesn't matter
if you're the one leaving

12:32.628 --> 12:35.923
or if... you're the one who got left.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.675
It makes folks do crazy things.

12:40.302 --> 12:43.805
Hell, I'm coaching soccer
for heaven's sake. In London.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.307
I mean, that's nuts.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.645
Yeah.

12:50.521 --> 12:52.773
But this job you gave me
has changed my life.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.861
It gave me the distance I needed
to see what was really going on.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.323
Yeah, but you and me...

13:03.283 --> 13:04.284
We're okay.

13:10.749 --> 13:11.750
Ted.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.961
Come on, just shake this hand.
My arm's starting to get--

13:19.842 --> 13:23.345
You know, I think that
if you care about someone

13:23.428 --> 13:26.598
and you got a little love in your heart,

13:26.682 --> 13:29.059
there ain't nothing
you can't get through together.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.310
You know what I'm saying?

13:34.815 --> 13:36.984
You're not just talking about us now,
are you?

13:38.068 --> 13:40.696
Maybe. Maybe not.

13:42.614 --> 13:43.907
Okay.

13:43.991 --> 13:45.701
I'm gonna go change
for practice-- training.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.619
Whatever. Who cares?

13:47.703 --> 13:49.621
Nice seeing you down here, boss.

13:50.581 --> 13:51.999
You liven up the place.

13:56.378 --> 13:57.754
All right, let's get it going, huh?

13:58.297 --> 14:00.674
Let's go. Gather up. Come on, now.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.302
All right, fellas, you gotta remember,
your body is like day-old rice.

14:03.385 --> 14:05.679
If it ain't warmed up properly,
something real bad could happen.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.431
Food poisoning is no joke.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.308
One time, I was being sick,

14:09.391 --> 14:11.310
and at the same time,
I was having diarrhea.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.937
Yep. That'll happen.
Anybody else wanna share?

14:14.021 --> 14:16.815
To be able to do both those things
at the same time?

14:16.899 --> 14:18.483
The body is a miracle.

14:18.984 --> 14:20.944
Yeah. Good perspective. I appreciate that.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.572
So, fellas,
we all know speed is important.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.200
But being able to stop
and change directions quickly?

14:26.283 --> 14:29.077
Well, that's like Kanye's
808s & Heartbreak.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.370
It don't get nearly enough credit.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.123
Okay, so let's line up on these cones
Nate put out. Let's go.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.501
All right, here's the deal.

14:35.584 --> 14:39.213
Last one to start, stop, then start again
is a rotten egg. Let's do it.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.843
Hey, Coach, I thought of a joke
this morning in the shower.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.096
What does a British owl say?

14:51.642 --> 14:52.851
Coach, what does a British owl--

14:55.229 --> 14:56.313
I was saying earlier that--

14:57.981 --> 15:00.359
You're acting like I'm chasing you
with a booger or something.

15:01.109 --> 15:03.195
Okay. All right.
I see what's going on here.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.404
This is about Roy, ain't it?

15:04.488 --> 15:07.908
So you gonna give me the cold shoulder
and the silent treatment. That's a combo.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.368
Does it come with a medium drink?

15:11.328 --> 15:12.454
Fine.

15:12.913 --> 15:15.290
Hey, Nate, what does a British owl say?

15:16.041 --> 15:18.377
You gonna do that move
where you act like you don't hear me

15:18.460 --> 15:19.837
and then you just walk away, huh?

15:19.920 --> 15:20.921
Yeah.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.507
It's like that now, huh?

15:24.049 --> 15:27.636
Heck with both of you guys.
I'm just gonna focus up here on practice.

15:27.719 --> 15:30.055
There you go, Dani. Dig in, baby. Come on.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.850
-Fuck.
-It's all right, Roy.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.727
-Fuck!
-Keep up, Roy!

15:35.811 --> 15:37.479
-You got this, Roy.
-Fuck!

15:37.563 --> 15:40.524
That's it. Swear it out, Roy.
Swear it out.

15:45.571 --> 15:46.572
Shoot.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.365
Okay.

15:52.995 --> 15:53.996
Okay.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.237
Yeah.

16:37.456 --> 16:38.874
There you are.

16:45.506 --> 16:46.507
Hey.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.969
There's a lot of other seats.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.846
Well, yeah, this is what my ticket says.

16:56.642 --> 16:57.768
How you doing, Roy?

16:57.851 --> 16:58.977
Fine. You?

16:59.520 --> 17:00.729
Good, good, yeah.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.023
I saw this video online

17:03.106 --> 17:07.236
of a kitten and a little baby chicken
becoming friends

17:07.319 --> 17:08.987
and just hanging out together.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.073
It was-- Well, here, let me
show it to you. I got it right here.

17:11.156 --> 17:12.156
What's this about?

17:15.702 --> 17:19.498
It's funny, 'cause whenever my mom
has something tough to talk about with me,

17:19.580 --> 17:23.417
she'll... you know,
she'll start it off saying something

17:23.502 --> 17:27.506
about, I don't know,
something weird, something overtly nice.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.716
And, yeah, I just thought the idea

17:29.800 --> 17:33.762
of a cat and a bird
being all simpatico was nice.

17:39.059 --> 17:42.855
Look, Roy, we've been talking about
the starting lineup against Man City--

17:42.938 --> 17:44.606
Don't you dare.
You're not fucking benching me.

17:44.690 --> 17:47.442
-Well, no. I'm just talking here, Roy. I--
-Yeah, talking. That's all you do is talk.

17:47.526 --> 17:49.570
Talking all that bullshit
about how you've got my back.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.822
-No. Hey, I do have your back.
-Bullshit!

17:51.905 --> 17:54.366
You pretended to be a man of your word.
You're fucking full of shit.

17:54.449 --> 17:57.077
You can go fuck yourself. Fuck you!

18:12.384 --> 18:14.678
There are a lot of surprises
happening here.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.348
Like that tiny little beard.

18:18.932 --> 18:23.395
It's called a Van Dyke
after the 17th century Flemish painter.

18:23.478 --> 18:26.273
-Right.
-And I think it makes me look how I feel.

18:27.024 --> 18:28.275
Chill.

18:28.358 --> 18:30.527
How does Mrs. Higgins feel about it?

18:30.611 --> 18:32.571
She hates it with a white-hot intensity.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.909
Right. Look...

18:38.202 --> 18:40.704
I came clean to Ted.
I told him everything.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.790
How did that go?

18:43.874 --> 18:47.085
You know what the little shit did?
He forgave me.

18:47.169 --> 18:49.421
-Fucking asshole.
-I know.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.717
But that's not actually why I'm here.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.511
I wanted to apologize to you for...

18:57.304 --> 18:58.472
treating you so poorly

18:58.555 --> 19:02.518
and forcing you to be an accomplice
in my moronically childish scheme.

19:02.601 --> 19:05.145
I am truly sorry, Higgins.

19:08.524 --> 19:09.650
Wow.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.070
Thank you, Rebecca.

19:15.239 --> 19:16.990
I lost my way for a minute.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.325
Yeah.

19:19.034 --> 19:20.035
But I'm on the road back.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.788
I can tell. You know what, it suits you.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.331
Unlike that beard.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.834
Sorry. Had to.

19:31.255 --> 19:34.091
I don't think I've ever had a child
in my house before.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.300
What about Jamie?

19:37.094 --> 19:39.096
We can't let her
go snooping around though.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.223
I don't want her to find my vibrator.

19:41.306 --> 19:44.393
Yeah, that's gonna be a problem.
Her mum said no electronics.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.482
So, how are you doing?

19:51.358 --> 19:52.359
Fine.

19:55.529 --> 19:57.990
I do kind of think
kids are pretty incredible.

19:58.073 --> 20:00.200
I mean, she's got new teeth
that push out her old teeth.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.994
The body is a miracle.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.704
You know,
the last time I was on the bench...

20:03.787 --> 20:05.289
You are ready to talk about real stuff.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.582
That's great.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.668
Wait one second.

20:11.795 --> 20:12.796
Come sit here.

20:17.843 --> 20:18.927
Take this.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.389
Okay, we're both ready. Lay it on me.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.477
Roy Kent has been the best player
on every team he's been on

20:27.561 --> 20:28.896
since he was a kid.

20:28.979 --> 20:31.315
I like being Roy Kent.

20:31.398 --> 20:35.319
I don't know if I can handle just being
some loser has-been called Roy.

20:35.903 --> 20:39.489
"All right, Roy?" Yeah.
"What you been up to?" Fuck all.

20:39.573 --> 20:44.453
God. I think men who feel sorry
for themselves are so sexy.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.080
-Stop it.
-No, seriously. I do.

20:47.164 --> 20:50.250
And if you start telling me how hard
it is playing a game for a living,

20:50.334 --> 20:51.293
I think I might come.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.045
It's not just a game to me.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.547
It's all I've ever known.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.841
It's who I am.

20:57.925 --> 20:59.426
It's all I am.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.012
Phoebe? Phoebe?

21:02.095 --> 21:03.639
Can you come here for a second?

21:06.975 --> 21:09.228
You were right. Zeppelin is amazing.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.063
Wait till you hear Cream.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.149
But first, I need you
to close your eyes for me, yeah?

21:15.150 --> 21:17.653
Okay. Can you describe your Uncle Roy?

21:17.736 --> 21:20.614
Everything that you can think of. Go.

21:21.198 --> 21:24.993
Well, he's my uncle.
His beard is scratchy.

21:25.077 --> 21:27.371
He buys me ice cream.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.872
He swears a lot.

21:29.831 --> 21:31.708
He's really funny.

21:32.209 --> 21:34.586
And I love him.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.465
Well done, Phoebe.

21:39.424 --> 21:42.302
See? I didn't hear anything
about being a footballer.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.639
Who gives a shit what she has to say?
She's six.

21:46.473 --> 21:50.227
The point is, you don't know
what people think about Roy Kent.

21:50.310 --> 21:54.398
Secondly, all that matters, Roy Kent,
is what you think about Roy.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.829
That your old girl playing chess
with some other bloke?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.290
-Yep.
-That's fucking brutal.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.041
She's just playing her game.

22:13.542 --> 22:14.626
You stay strong, you hear?

22:15.127 --> 22:16.503
You're a beautiful man.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.091
Hey, fellas.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.848
Well, that's a lot of pints just for us.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.058
I thought you might've had
a tough time with Roy.

22:30.142 --> 22:34.188
Coach, you are a natural-born caregiver.
Like Chief from Cuckoo's Nest.

22:35.022 --> 22:36.899
I was always more of a Taber guy.

22:40.903 --> 22:44.656
But if I'm being honest, I actually
never got around to telling Roy.

22:45.574 --> 22:48.452
Now, don't give me those eyes.
He figured it out all on his own.

22:49.745 --> 22:51.914
I can see you're happy now, but don't be.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.665
'Cause I've been thinking about it and...

22:54.291 --> 22:56.460
well, I'm starting Roy
against Man City and that's that.

22:57.044 --> 22:59.922
Look, putting him on the bench
wouldn't just be humiliating to him,

23:00.005 --> 23:02.341
it could actually affect his livelihood.

23:03.091 --> 23:05.636
And you know better than anyone
that all this ain't about winning to me.

23:05.719 --> 23:07.387
'Cause that ain't
how we measure success, right?

23:07.471 --> 23:08.847
Damn it, it is!

23:13.352 --> 23:16.855
Hey. Who put a firecracker
up your butt and lit it?

23:16.939 --> 23:19.775
You did! And I'm sick of it.

23:19.858 --> 23:22.027
Look, I understood this mission
when we were in Kansas.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.862
But those were kids
and these are professionals

23:23.946 --> 23:25.447
and winning does matter to them.

23:25.531 --> 23:28.242
And it matters to me. And that's okay.

23:29.409 --> 23:32.120
-Ain't that right, Mae?
-A-fucking-men it is.

23:35.082 --> 23:36.959
How do you not get it?
Losing has repercussions.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.502
We lose, we get relegated.

23:38.585 --> 23:41.213
We get relegated, this is over
and we will have built nothing.

23:41.797 --> 23:45.425
And if you wanna pick a player's feelings
over a coach's duty to make a point...

23:47.010 --> 23:48.846
I don't wanna drink
with someone that selfish.

23:54.226 --> 23:56.728
That was the sexiest fucking thing
I've ever seen in my life.

23:56.812 --> 23:57.938
Get your things.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.023
She's been toying with you.

24:00.941 --> 24:03.110
Checkmate, mate.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.652
-I'm good.
-You got a nut allergy?

24:45.736 --> 24:47.279
I got a finger allergy.

24:47.863 --> 24:49.907
What else have I got to offer you here?
We got red wine.

24:50.741 --> 24:51.742
We got tea.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.536
Two-day-old pasta water.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.246
Tea's fine.

24:57.331 --> 24:59.249
Look, I'm sorry I told you
to go fuck yourself.

25:00.292 --> 25:02.461
I'm usually better at hiding my anger.

25:03.837 --> 25:04.838
You think so, huh?

25:06.381 --> 25:07.883
Know thyself.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.343
Rest in peace, Socrates.

25:12.221 --> 25:14.056
Told my niece I might not be playing.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.934
She asked if we could go get ice cream.

25:17.017 --> 25:19.645
Well, hey, at least you had someone
you could talk to, right?

25:20.270 --> 25:21.271
How was the ice cream?

25:21.355 --> 25:23.065
Good. It's fucking ice cream.

25:23.148 --> 25:24.858
Yeah, right? Ice cream's the best.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.528
It's kinda like seeing Billy Joel
perform live, you know?

25:27.611 --> 25:28.612
It never disappoints.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.532
It does give me the toots though.

25:32.115 --> 25:33.450
The ice cream, not Billy Joel.

25:33.867 --> 25:37.329
I asked her if she was still gonna
watch the match if I wasn't playing.

25:37.788 --> 25:38.789
Yeah?

25:38.872 --> 25:43.126
Little shit said yes. Didn't even blink.
Just straight into my face.

25:43.210 --> 25:45.337
Well, hey. That's showbiz, ain't it?

25:45.963 --> 25:48.298
I promised myself I was never
gonna watch Fresh Prince again

25:48.382 --> 25:49.800
when they swapped out Aunt Vivs.

25:49.883 --> 25:52.761
But truth be told, as long
as they let Carlton do his thing,

25:52.845 --> 25:54.847
I was always gonna take a minute
and just sit right there.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.349
Sidebar: Alfonso Ribeiro,

25:57.432 --> 26:01.103
the greatest physical comedian
of the 19th, 20th and 21st century.

26:01.562 --> 26:02.771
Case in point right here.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.607
Iconic, yeah?

26:05.691 --> 26:08.652
I never know how to react when a grown man
does the Carlton in front of me.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.154
You could see a silhouette doing this,
you know exactly what it is,

26:11.238 --> 26:15.367
you know exactly who's doing it.
It is the one, the only, Alfonso--

26:15.450 --> 26:17.995
-Knock it off!
-Sorry, Ms. Shipley!

26:18.078 --> 26:20.080
It has been a whole thing this last week.

26:20.873 --> 26:22.958
Anyway. You know what we could do?

26:23.041 --> 26:24.376
You've been hurt off and on all season.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.879
Why don't we just say you're injured,
you can't play? No shame in that.

26:27.421 --> 26:29.923
That would help protect my stock
if I wanna move next season.

26:30.716 --> 26:32.718
Maybe to a club
that actually wants to start me.

26:32.801 --> 26:33.802
Come on.

26:33.886 --> 26:38.473
What if, God forbid, I end up
having to play in fucking America,

26:38.891 --> 26:40.642
where I'd dominate, by the way.

26:40.726 --> 26:43.353
They'd be like,
"Oh, is this football then?"

26:43.437 --> 26:45.939
Well, obviously, my preference
would be to have you there.

26:46.023 --> 26:48.066
At practice tomorrow and the game.

26:48.150 --> 26:51.528
But hey,
you gotta do what's right for you.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.494
Can I think about it?

27:00.454 --> 27:02.789
I'd call you a big dummy, poo-poo face
if you didn't.

27:11.173 --> 27:14.259
Be honest with me. It's a prank, right?
The tea.

27:14.343 --> 27:17.346
Like, when us tourist folks aren't around,
y'all know this tastes like garbage.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.015
No. I love it.

27:20.098 --> 27:21.808
You don't love it. It's pigeon sweat.

27:26.396 --> 27:28.148
Horrible. Horrible.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.233
Yeah.

27:29.650 --> 27:32.486
No, get rid of the small one and bring
back the tall one. He's got bigger hands.

27:33.779 --> 27:35.614
It's biscuits o'clock.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.492
-Higgins! You're back!
-Yeah!

27:38.575 --> 27:42.496
All right. Well, hey, I know I may be
a little too old-school for some folks,

27:42.579 --> 27:44.873
but I'm gonna say it anyway.
Hell to the yeah.

27:44.957 --> 27:46.959
-Good to see you.
-Nice to see you too.

27:47.042 --> 27:49.628
-Here you go, boss. Those are yours.
-Thank you, Ted.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.255
You've got to try one of these.

27:51.338 --> 27:54.842
No, he does not. Caring is sharing,
but I brought Higgins his own.

27:54.925 --> 27:55.926
What?

27:56.343 --> 27:57.302
How did you know?

27:57.386 --> 27:59.096
Well, I had a hunch
you were gonna be here.

27:59.179 --> 28:00.848
-Yeah.
-Wow.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.600
Actually, those were for Trent Crimm's
daughter. She turns three today.

28:03.684 --> 28:07.187
-But it means more to me if you had 'em.
-What? No. No, no. Come on.

28:07.271 --> 28:08.647
No. It's okay. She won't remember.

28:08.730 --> 28:10.399
Ted, you've already told her?

28:10.482 --> 28:12.109
Yeah, weeks ago.
She's been looking forward to it.

28:12.192 --> 28:14.236
But she's three. She'll bounce right back.
It'll be fine.

28:14.319 --> 28:15.988
-No way.
-No, no. I insist. I insist.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.948
I'm screwing with you.
I'm just messing around.

28:18.031 --> 28:20.784
I predicted this whole thing,
and I made those myself for you.

28:21.243 --> 28:22.327
Thank you.

28:24.329 --> 28:26.790
Okay, y'all. I'll see you in a little bit,
okay? Let's go, Greyhounds.

28:28.667 --> 28:30.711
Yeah, these are definitely
for a little girl.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.213
Maybe he thinks you're silly
and playful and mysterious.

28:33.297 --> 28:34.381
Oh, sure.

28:49.021 --> 28:51.773
Okay, fellas! Need y'all to listen up.

28:53.108 --> 28:54.276
Coach.

28:55.569 --> 28:56.570
Coach.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.826
-Now--
-I know now's not the best time, Coach,

29:02.910 --> 29:06.163
but I have been feeling physically sick
since walking away from you the other day.

29:06.622 --> 29:08.165
Plus last night,
I had a horrible nightmare

29:08.248 --> 29:10.292
that I was pecking you to death
like a crow.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.460
I'm so sorry.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.713
It's okay, Nate.
We're all good in the hood, all right?

29:15.130 --> 29:16.715
-Yeah.
-But hey, but do me a favor.

29:16.798 --> 29:19.259
Try to apologize to me in your dream
so we're good on that side of things too.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.928
-Yeah. Of course.
-Thank you.

29:21.011 --> 29:23.931
Now, fellas, we got ourselves
a heck of a match comin' up, yeah?

29:24.890 --> 29:26.517
And what I'm gonna need
from all of y'all--

29:36.777 --> 29:37.778
Sorry, mate.

29:38.320 --> 29:41.573
My six-year-old niece
found my girlfriend's vibrator.

29:43.116 --> 29:44.660
So I had to take her
to get her ears pierced

29:44.743 --> 29:46.411
in an attempt to erase the memory.

29:48.580 --> 29:49.831
Been there.

29:50.749 --> 29:51.750
Can I say something?

29:51.834 --> 29:53.460
Floor is yours, Captain.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.133
Second team's gonna kick
first team's fucking asses today.

30:09.434 --> 30:12.479
All right, fellas! Finish getting ready,
and then we'll do what the man says.

30:12.563 --> 30:14.231
We'll settle this out on the pitch.
Let's go.
