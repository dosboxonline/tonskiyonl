<i>Previously on</i> This Is Us...

00:02.711 --> 00:04.254
Hey, Randall, take the next part.

00:04.337 --> 00:07.382
KEITH:
Yeah, come on. You got this, bro.

00:07.465 --> 00:09.009
How is your brother blacker
than you, Randall?

00:09.092 --> 00:10.135
(laughs)

00:10.218 --> 00:11.886
-Randall's an Oreo.
-(laughter)

00:13.972 --> 00:16.975
Hello there, Randall.
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

00:17.976 --> 00:19.019
ALLISON:
Dad?

00:19.102 --> 00:20.729
<i>KEVIN:</i>
<i>If I had been there,</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:22.480
I would've walked through literal fire

00:22.564 --> 00:24.149
and I would've pulled that man out.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.151
Hmm.

00:26.234 --> 00:29.279
Well, Kev, I guess we'll never
know because you weren't there.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.281
And he died ashamed of you.

00:31.364 --> 00:32.907
You know, I used to think
the worst thing that happened to me

00:32.991 --> 00:34.492
was the day that Dad died.

00:34.576 --> 00:37.037
It's the day they brought you home.

00:37.120 --> 00:40.832
Growing up, I, uh, I just
had to keep so many things to myself

00:40.915 --> 00:43.668
because I didn't want
to make you guys feel bad.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.340
I'm calling to ask you to be my best man.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.549
<i>RANDALL (over phone):</i>
<i>Absolutely.</i>

00:49.632 --> 00:51.217
Uh, I'd be honored.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.844
When you stand up there next to me,

00:52.927 --> 00:54.387
I don't want there to be
anything between us.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.181
<i>What if I come...</i>
<i>What if I come out?</i>

00:56.264 --> 00:58.224
<i>-What if I come see you?</i>
-Yeah, brother,

00:58.308 --> 01:00.310
that's-that's cool with me.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.812
<i>Well, all right, then.</i>
<i>I'll book the fight.</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:12.197
Yeah.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.907
Definitely a lot of moisture swirling in

01:13.990 --> 01:15.909
from that low-pressure center.

01:15.992 --> 01:18.536
Once it cross I-70 and hit that cold air?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.455
Time for the heavy coats.

01:20.538 --> 01:24.084
(laughs softly)
Sorry, enough about snow.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.960
-Hmm?
-Mm-hmm. (laughs)

01:26.044 --> 01:28.171
Mmm.
How was <i>your</i> day, honey?

01:28.254 --> 01:31.257
Honestly, I wouldn't mind
a snow day or two.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.177
If I have to explain
the Dewey Decimal System

01:34.260 --> 01:35.387
-one more time...
-That's, uh,

01:35.470 --> 01:37.681
Donald Duck's nephew, right?

01:37.764 --> 01:40.809
Hush.
(laughs)

01:40.892 --> 01:42.435
Hmm.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.104
Sounds like we're gonna
have to grab your winter coat

01:44.187 --> 01:45.939
and gloves from the basement
for school tomorrow.

01:46.022 --> 01:48.566
-Mm-hmm.
-Randall?

01:49.984 --> 01:51.820
Randall?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.449
That's okay, bud.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.992
I got it, hmm?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.623
♪ ♪

02:09.254 --> 02:11.297
Yeah, well, I knew Randall was obsessed,

02:11.381 --> 02:14.509
but it looks like Mister Rogers
has his hooks in Kev now, too.

02:15.593 --> 02:17.345
Yeah. Yeah.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.431
Yeah, I'm just about to tell 'em.

02:19.514 --> 02:22.142
Okay.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.645
Now would you please go enjoy
your girls' weekend?

02:25.729 --> 02:26.855
Yeah.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.274
Hey, kiss Katie girl three times for me.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.693
Okay. Yeah, I love you, too. Bye.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.611
Hey, boys?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.739
I have a big surprise for you.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.199
Boys, hey.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.535
Okay, so gigantic news.

02:40.618 --> 02:44.080
I'm just gonna,
I'm gonna turn this off gently.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.291
-Dad! We was watching it!
-Dad!

02:46.374 --> 02:48.043
Yeah, no, I know.
Hey, look, don't jump down my throat.

02:48.126 --> 02:49.461
I got a question for you.

02:49.544 --> 02:51.129
What is better than

02:51.212 --> 02:54.591
watching Mister Rogers on TV? Huh?

02:55.592 --> 02:59.262
Maybe going and seeing
Mister Rogers live in person?

02:59.346 --> 03:01.806
(gasps) That's right.
<i>Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</i>

03:01.890 --> 03:03.892
is filmed right here in Pittsburgh.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.979
The man himself, he wants to chat
with some little neighbors.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.647
So what do you say?
Do you guys want to go?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.733
-BOTH: Yeah!
-Yeah, that's right.

03:11.816 --> 03:14.361
That's right. Of course you want to go.
We want to go.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.696
Hey, I'm gonna use these hands
a little later

03:16.780 --> 03:18.907
because we're gonna write a thank-you note

03:18.990 --> 03:21.201
to Pete in construction
for getting us on the list.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.661
Right? Okay, so, your spoons are down,

03:23.745 --> 03:26.206
-I want your jammies off.
-(both laugh)

03:26.289 --> 03:28.083
And then we'll go, go, go, go, go.

03:28.166 --> 03:30.168
(laughter)

03:30.251 --> 03:32.420
Get those jams off. Come on.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.304
Randall, I said I wasn't finished yet.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.056
What?

03:43.139 --> 03:44.557
You know I like to drink
the milk at the end.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.975
Oh. Sorry.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.521
You know, Randall, I know
Kevin's visit has you on edge,

03:49.604 --> 03:52.816
but let's not let the sweet,
sweet cereal milk suffer for it.

03:54.192 --> 03:57.570
It's just so... formal.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.240
I mean, he's flying all the way
out here to talk about...

04:00.323 --> 04:01.449
you know...

04:01.533 --> 04:03.618
Your racially-charged childhood?

04:03.702 --> 04:06.121
-That's not what I was...
-Randall.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.665
(stammers softly)

04:08.748 --> 04:12.168
I asked for this, here it is,

04:12.252 --> 04:15.255
and now I wish I could
put it off for another 40 years.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.298
Randall, the man is coming

04:17.382 --> 04:20.552
across country
to have a long-awaited talk.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.178
This needs to happen.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.222
I know. And it will.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.937
Well, I am taking the girls ice skating,

04:31.021 --> 04:32.439
clearing out for the day.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.857
Let you two have your space.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.734
-Y'all can stay if you want.
-(chuckles): Oh, no.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.193
You know good and well,
if the girls see him first,

04:37.277 --> 04:38.611
they will be sucking up

04:38.695 --> 04:40.697
all of Uncle Kevin's time and attention.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.576
Look, you said his acting was trash

04:44.659 --> 04:46.119
and his father died ashamed of him.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.663
He said he hated
that they ever adopted you.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.958
Can't get any worse.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.010
It can get worse.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.470
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

05:05.722 --> 05:07.390
What up?

05:07.474 --> 05:09.642
The Fresh Prince
has finally arrived in L.A.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.103
-How was the cab ride, man?
-Oh, it was fine, I guess.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.606
-Yeah?
-Didn't think there'd literally be palm trees everywhere.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.274
Did you whistle for a cab,

05:16.358 --> 05:17.942
and when it came near,
the license plate said "Fresh"

05:18.026 --> 05:19.778
-and it had dice in the mirror?
-(chuckles)

05:19.861 --> 05:21.696
You're stupid.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.948
Wait, so you've been
in this apartment for two months

05:24.032 --> 05:26.493
and this is all your furniture?
I mean, where'd you get it?

05:26.576 --> 05:27.911
The streets?

05:27.994 --> 05:29.871
-Yeah, pretty much.
-(laughs)

05:29.954 --> 05:32.290
Wait, we're not gonna
be sharing the same bed, right?

05:32.374 --> 05:34.084
'Cause I would rather just stay
at the hotel with the team.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.794
You call Model U.N. a "team"?

05:35.877 --> 05:37.879
(laughs):
Shut up.

05:37.962 --> 05:39.923
Hey, so, we partying this week or what?

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
Nah, no.
If I'm not studying,

05:42.092 --> 05:43.718
I'm gonna be dipping in and out
for team meetings.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.720
Randall, it's your spring break, man.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.764
It's your first time visiting me, okay?

05:47.847 --> 05:50.058
It's the perfect opportunity
for us to own L.A.,

05:50.141 --> 05:52.394
just the two of us.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.648
Well, I don't know, I guess a little fun

05:56.731 --> 05:58.525
could loosen me up for the conference.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.819
-Tonight? Huh?
-T... Uh...

06:01.903 --> 06:03.947
(sighs)
Fine.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.950
There he is.
(chuckles)

06:08.785 --> 06:09.994
Let's pregame.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.583
<i>-(doorbell rings)</i>
-(laughs softly)

06:15.667 --> 06:17.627
-There he is.
-Hey.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.504
-Get in here.
-Yeah?

06:19.587 --> 06:20.588
-Yeah.
-How you doing, man?

06:20.672 --> 06:21.589
-All right.
-You good?

06:21.673 --> 06:23.425
-I'm good, man. Yeah.
-Good.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.592
(door closes)

06:25.677 --> 06:27.846
You, uh...
Decent flight?

06:27.929 --> 06:29.222
-Huh?
-Decent flight?

06:29.305 --> 06:31.099
Oh, y...
Nah, no.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.642
Yeah, it was a mixed bag, actually.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.228
You know, I, uh,
I-I dominated on easy sudoku,

06:35.311 --> 06:37.397
and then I moved up a level
and got smoked, so...

06:37.480 --> 06:39.691
Well, you're either
an all-star or a ball boy.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.402
-No in-betweens in sudoku.
-That is true.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.821
-It's what I've learned.
-Yeah.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.947
Anyway...

06:47.782 --> 06:49.534
Sorry.
I keep checking this...

06:49.617 --> 06:51.494
I-I'm expecting a call
from Robert De Niro.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.997
We're supposed to talk about
our reshoots, and I feel myself

06:54.080 --> 06:55.874
compelled to constantly check my phone

06:55.957 --> 06:57.876
to make sure the battery's
not dying, because...

06:57.959 --> 07:00.003
-You walked out of set on him.
-Yeah, that's right.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.923
-My brother, walking out on Bobby D.
-Well, it's...

07:04.007 --> 07:05.467
Don't let yourself
get too attached to anything

07:05.550 --> 07:07.302
that you're not willing
to walk out on in 30 seconds flat

07:07.385 --> 07:10.096
if you feel the heat around the corner.

07:10.180 --> 07:11.473
It's <i>Heat.</i>

07:11.556 --> 07:14.184
Yeah.
That's good.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.561
Thank you.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.982
-Listen, I don't want
to beat around the bush...Need some water?

07:21.066 --> 07:22.859
No? Hmm?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.028
Uh... I'm... I'm fine.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.529
Um...

07:29.032 --> 07:30.867
Look...

07:30.950 --> 07:34.287
I just feel like it would be
easy to start catching up,

07:34.371 --> 07:37.957
you know, and fall back into our rhythm

07:38.041 --> 07:40.001
without actually talking.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.836
And I don't want this to get away from me.

07:41.920 --> 07:46.883
Randall, there are some things
I need to say to you.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.347
Here we go.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.308
Here we go.

07:58.561 --> 07:59.979
You guys excited?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.523
-BOTH: Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:01.606 --> 08:04.317
Mister Rogers will be arriving
soon, gang, and he loves

08:04.401 --> 08:06.403
talking with boys and girls
like yourselves.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.029
Let's hurry up
so everyone has a good seat.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.865
Name?
All right.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.826
Here you go.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.078
And, uh, here you go.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.123
-Thank you.
-And...

08:18.206 --> 08:20.125
-Uh...
-Hey, uh, Jack Pearson.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.960
-We should be on the list.
-Uh...

08:22.043 --> 08:23.169
Yep.
Yeah, no, we got you.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.879
-And, uh, how many kids you got?
-Just two.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.673
Fantastic.

08:26.756 --> 08:27.882
There you go.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.218
-And there you go.
-Uh...

08:30.301 --> 08:32.345
Actually, no, these, uh,
these two are mine.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.597
-Right here.
-Oh. Oh, my God.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.975
I-I'm so sorry.
That's, um, that's-that's my fault.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.685
JACK: No, no, it's not a problem.
It's not a problem.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.021
It's an easy mistake.
Happens all the time.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.897
We're just happy to be on the list.
Right?

08:42.981 --> 08:46.818
Yeah. Randall here, he's a huge,
huge fan of Mister Rogers.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.362
So if maybe, like,
there's a, uh, a special seat,

08:49.446 --> 08:51.197
think that'd be nice.
Wouldn't you like that, bud?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.824
Yeah.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.617
STEPH:
Uh... of course.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.161
Great. Thanks.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.335
All right, you're an official neighbor

09:03.418 --> 09:04.502

09:04.586 --> 09:06.171

-Right? Look at that.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.756
It says you're special.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.424
I'm gonna get you a special seat, huh?

09:46.628 --> 09:48.380
Yeah.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.465
Uh... right now.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.801
I took the imitative of getting
us some fake IDs, bro.

Yeah, uh, a friend of mine

10:23.748 --> 10:26.042
No time to get fancy, I just borrowed it

10:26.126 --> 10:27.585
from a buddy of mine in acting class.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.797
But it looks nothing like me.
He's... he's pushing 40.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.507
Who cares?

10:32.590 --> 10:33.800
He's a Black guy, you're a Black guy.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.302
-It'll be fine.
-(chuckles)

10:36.386 --> 10:40.306

Promise.

10:43.601 --> 10:45.020
RANDALL:
Speak freely, man.

10:45.103 --> 10:48.023
Obviously I had a conversation with Kate.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.899
On our birthday.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.736
She clearly relayed some things to you.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.738
Yeah, she did.

10:54.821 --> 10:55.989
Um...

11:00.035 --> 11:02.078
Look, Randall.
I'm not blind, okay?

11:02.162 --> 11:04.164
I understand...

11:04.247 --> 11:06.458
that it must've been difficult for you

11:06.541 --> 11:08.626
growing up a Black kid in a white family.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.628
And I know...

11:10.712 --> 11:14.883
being the only Black kid
in your school wasn't easy either.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.677
Sure.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.308
I've been thinking a lot
about high school.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.686
Um, the prom.
You remember the-the prom?

11:26.770 --> 11:28.688
That girl you took-- the redhead--
what's her name?

11:28.772 --> 11:29.814
-Allison.
-Allison. That's right.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.274
You took Allison to the prom

11:31.358 --> 11:35.862
only to have her dad treat you... awfully.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.948
The guy was a racist prick.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.202
I should've done more to protect you

11:42.285 --> 11:43.578
in that situation, Randall.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.871
I wish I would have.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
You know, I was standing right there, man.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.541

11:50.585 --> 11:53.088
I didn't do anything.

11:53.171 --> 11:56.049
I should've protected you.
I'm sorry.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.473
I've been thinking
a lot about that, you know.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.686
And I'm sorry if you ever felt alone.

12:07.769 --> 12:12.607
And I'm sorry if your childhood wasn't...

12:12.691 --> 12:16.194
what you wanted it to be.

12:16.277 --> 12:20.448
And I am genuinely sorry, Randall...

12:22.450 --> 12:24.369
...if I played any part

12:24.452 --> 12:27.997
in ever making you feel alone or bad.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.751
Ever.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.926
It's something I should've said
a long time ago.

12:40.010 --> 12:42.804
And I wanted to come here,
I wanted to look at you,

12:42.887 --> 12:45.807
right in the eye,
and I want to say it to your face.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.437
Thanks, Kev.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.864
Hey.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.450
Come on, Randall,
so, what I'm trying to say is,

13:03.533 --> 13:06.870
honestly, man,
from the bottom of my heart, I'm...

13:06.953 --> 13:08.872
-I'm really sorry.
-Yeah, man.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.916
And I appreciate it.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.919
Okay, good, 'cause it just...

13:15.003 --> 13:16.838
it doesn't really seem like you do.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.298
(sighs)

13:19.758 --> 13:23.845
It's a very kind sentiment.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.348
It was a beautiful monologue.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.019
You're annoyed with me.

13:31.102 --> 13:32.729
Trying not to be.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.149
Man, I got to s...

13:37.567 --> 13:38.777
what you're expecting from me.

Kev, honestly, I don't know.

-You don't know?
-I don't.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.115
-But you're annoyed with me?
-I'm trying not to be.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.585
I think I'm gonna get a little air.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.046
Randall, look, man.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.137
I said I need some air, Kev.

14:06.221 --> 14:09.015
-As in "give me space for a sec."
-Yeah.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.976
I've been giving you space for a sec
for a really long time.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.358
You've been unhappy with us.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.652
You said there were things...

14:20.735 --> 14:23.196
uh, that happened in our family
that we didn't acknowledge,

14:23.279 --> 14:25.573
things we didn't see.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.201
You've been cold-shouldering me
for about a year now.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.578
We've both been cold-shouldering
each other, Kev.

14:30.662 --> 14:33.832

Come on.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.625

14:35.709 --> 14:38.420
how messed-up the prom situation was.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.965
But you're just glossing over
one overt moment of racism

14:42.048 --> 14:43.883

speech of things

14:43.967 --> 14:45.552
-that you think I want to hear.
-Well, that's not fair.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.811

That is not taking responsibility.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.304
You're really something, Randall.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.645
You know, I had to drink tonight

20:28.728 --> 20:30.522
to brace myself
for a night with my brother.

20:30.605 --> 20:32.482
Dude, you drank 'cause you're a drunk.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.151
I have no problem going out
and having fun.

20:35.235 --> 20:37.237
I just have a problem doing it with you.

20:37.320 --> 20:38.863
Get out of my face.

20:38.947 --> 20:40.323
-Oh, what are you gonna do about it?
-Don't touch me, Randall.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.700
-Oh, don't touch you.
-Don't touch me.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.368
Get out of my face!
Do not touch me!

20:43.451 --> 20:45.078
-What is wrong with you?
-DRIVER: Hey, hey. You two...

20:45.161 --> 20:46.454
got to get the hell out my cab.

20:46.538 --> 20:47.789
-Great, Randall.
-You're an ass.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.666
KEVIN:
You're an ass. Look what you did.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.002
-You're literally still touching me.
-What are you talking about?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.003
Hey, hey! Now.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.462
KEVIN:
It's your fault, you idiot.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.214
RANDALL (quietly):
You're such an ass.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.551
-So tired of you always having something to say.
-Okay. Okay.

20:59.634 --> 21:02.137
-Come at me. I'm gonna kick your ass.
-Bring it, then, man.

21:02.220 --> 21:03.722
-Come on!
-Come here! Come here!

21:03.805 --> 21:06.016
Yeah, y'all definitely about to box.
(chuckles)

21:06.099 --> 21:08.101
-Watch!
-I want to see you try.

21:12.772 --> 21:17.152
Now we reach our hands way up high.

21:17.235 --> 21:20.864
And then we shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake, shake.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.699
Remember...

21:22.782 --> 21:25.410
I like you just the way you are.

21:29.122 --> 21:30.707
Hey, that was pretty cool, right?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.083
-Did you guys have fun?
-Yeah.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.668
KEVIN:
I want to go

21:33.752 --> 21:35.712
to the playground.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.881
Hey, Kev, the playground's
always gonna be there.

21:37.964 --> 21:41.134
Okay? This was a once
in a lifetime opportunity.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.136
Hey, boys' weekend's not over.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.013
So we can go nuts
at the playground tomorrow, okay?

21:45.096 --> 21:46.222
-Let's go.
-Tag, you're it!

21:46.306 --> 21:48.141
Kevin, I'm not playing around.

21:48.224 --> 21:49.851
Kevin, right...

21:49.934 --> 21:51.936
Randall, stay right here, okay?
Don't move.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.647
Kevin?

22:08.453 --> 22:10.497
Hello.
What's your name?

22:12.749 --> 22:14.918
(grunting)

22:15.001 --> 22:17.128
-Get off me!
-Hell no!

22:17.212 --> 22:19.339
(both grunting)

22:25.261 --> 22:27.138
Ow! Idiot!

22:27.222 --> 22:28.807
I have an audition tomorrow morning!

22:28.890 --> 22:30.308
You hit me in the face, Randall!

22:30.392 --> 22:32.102
I didn't even hit you that hard.
I was trying to pin you.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.312
You don't even have a mark.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.239
What?!

22:44.322 --> 22:46.074
I don't have my keys.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.867
Oh, please tell me you didn't
leave 'em in the taxi.

22:49.619 --> 22:51.830
They're probably here somewhere.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.464
(breathes deeply)

23:08.471 --> 23:10.473
-You're gonna have to address this.
-Can we just focus

23:10.557 --> 23:12.017
on getting back in the house, please?

23:12.100 --> 23:13.435
Miss Palm has a spare key.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.811
Wait a minute, you gave your neighbor

23:14.894 --> 23:16.855
-access to your house?
-She's a sweet old lady

23:16.938 --> 23:19.691
that never goes anywhere... hopefully.

23:19.774 --> 23:21.776
Please be home.

23:26.781 --> 23:29.701
Councilman Pearson?

23:29.784 --> 23:31.995
-How you doing, honey?
-Hi, Miss Palm.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.913
I'm good, thanks.

23:33.997 --> 23:36.249
And is that the Manny?

23:36.332 --> 23:38.126
Hey, Miss Palm.
How are you?

23:38.209 --> 23:40.045
Well, what in the world is the Manny

23:40.128 --> 23:41.755
and the councilman doing at my door?

23:41.838 --> 23:43.381
He's actually my brother.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.507
I'm adopted.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.593
Oh, that's right.

23:46.676 --> 23:49.262
Well, you boys must have had some parents.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.805
KEVIN:
Yes!

23:50.889 --> 23:52.349
Yes, we did have some parents.

23:52.432 --> 23:53.975
Uh, listen, ma'am, we actually
got locked out of the house.

23:54.059 --> 23:56.311
Do happen to have that spare key?

23:56.394 --> 23:57.729
Oh, let me check.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.230
Thank you.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.316
(door closes)

24:04.736 --> 24:06.279
What?

24:08.073 --> 24:10.700
-You called me racist.
-No, I didn't.

24:10.784 --> 24:12.994
-You called yourself racist.
-Oh, come on.

24:13.078 --> 24:15.080
-Why would I do that?
-Is that a rhetorical question?

24:15.163 --> 24:17.248
Because if so, then I would
answer rhetorically.

24:17.332 --> 24:18.792
Mm, guilt?

24:18.875 --> 24:20.669
Your brother, Randall.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.546
Your brother who loves you,
who pretty much worships you.

24:23.630 --> 24:25.924
-I don't want you to worship me.
-In fact... okay, hold on a second.

24:26.007 --> 24:27.550
Your brother who came here today to say,

24:27.634 --> 24:29.260
"I am sorry."

24:29.344 --> 24:31.471
I'm sorry that I missed things
when we were growing up.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.474
I'm sorry that you ever felt alone.

24:36.351 --> 24:37.852
How exactly is that racist?

24:37.936 --> 24:39.104
It was never just

24:39.187 --> 24:40.563
that I was a nerd.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.774
You had to call me Carlton.

24:42.857 --> 24:45.193
It was never just that
I-I didn't know cool music.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.362
You had to call me out for not

24:47.445 --> 24:49.406
knowing rap lyrics.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.533
What if I was white?

24:51.616 --> 24:53.993
-Would we have the same relationship?
-Of course.

24:54.077 --> 24:56.371
Yes, we'd be brothers.
I would love you like a brother.

24:56.454 --> 24:58.039
And you know what else?
We'd butt heads

24:58.123 --> 24:59.958
-just like brothers do.
-Nah, man, not-not on this level.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.543
You're making me out to be
some sort of Grand Wizard here.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.545
I don't think you're a racist, man.

25:03.628 --> 25:04.838
I really don't.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.632
But the microaggressions
through the years...

25:07.716 --> 25:09.926
I was jealous of you,
it had nothing to do with you being

25:10.010 --> 25:11.761
Black, Randall, it had to do with my envy.

25:11.845 --> 25:13.471
-What do you want from me?
-I want you to acknowledge

25:13.555 --> 25:16.182
that you've always resented
the fact that I'm Black.

25:16.266 --> 25:19.144
And not just as kids, man.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.938
Last year you told me, to my face,

25:22.022 --> 25:24.357
that the worst thing
that ever happened to you

25:24.441 --> 25:26.276
was me being brought home to your family.

25:26.359 --> 25:28.695
Yeah, I said that to you because
you were manipulating our mother

25:28.778 --> 25:30.864
to do something
that she didn't want to do.

25:30.947 --> 25:32.449
Right.

25:32.532 --> 25:33.992
Here you go, sweetie.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.411
Thank you so much, ma'am.
You are a blessing.

25:36.494 --> 25:41.124
Oh, I hated that Stallone movie--
too violent.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.168
You should be funny more.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.962
Like Dick Van Dyke and Richard Pryor.

25:46.046 --> 25:47.964
All right, well, thank you.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.883
I had a Golden Globe nomination
for that performance,

25:49.966 --> 25:51.801
but, ah...

25:51.885 --> 25:53.887
I'll just be a clown.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.891
-Randall?
-Hey, man...

25:57.974 --> 26:00.935
do you ever consider the fact...

26:01.019 --> 26:03.646
that me being brought home
to the Pearson family

26:03.730 --> 26:06.316
wasn't a perfect day for me, either?

26:06.399 --> 26:09.235
It was the day that I lost
William and Laurel.

26:11.112 --> 26:13.031
So you never think about that?

26:13.114 --> 26:15.241
That the day Mom and Dad found me
was also the day

26:15.325 --> 26:18.411
that I lost my own
birth mother and birth father?

26:23.291 --> 26:25.085
I think...

26:26.294 --> 26:27.962
Just say it, man.

26:29.881 --> 26:32.926
I think you sound wildly ungrateful.

26:33.009 --> 26:35.428
-Hmm.
-Honestly. Mom and Dad saved your life.

26:35.512 --> 26:38.098
You think I'm not grateful for that?
Of course I'm grateful.

26:38.181 --> 26:40.266
And I have been told
how grateful I should be

26:40.350 --> 26:42.936
and how lucky I should feel
my whole life, man.

26:43.019 --> 26:45.563
And if, for a second,
I don't act that way,

26:45.647 --> 26:47.524
people come at me crazy,

26:47.607 --> 26:48.900
-like you are right now.
-Can you blame 'em?

26:48.983 --> 26:51.277
It is a prison, Kevin,

26:51.361 --> 26:53.655
having to show gratitude,
and nothing but gratitude,

26:53.738 --> 26:55.407
all the damn time.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.117
It's suffocating, man!

26:57.200 --> 26:59.244
Well, I'm so sorry that you
feel suffocated, Randall.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.121
I'm sorry that you feel trapped
by your family.

27:01.204 --> 27:02.831
Your white family.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.416
Damn it!
That is not what I'm trying to say!

27:04.499 --> 27:06.376
That's what you did say.

27:08.336 --> 27:10.797
I don't...

27:19.139 --> 27:20.640
(sighs)

27:23.768 --> 27:26.229
I needed to stretch, too, so I decided

27:26.312 --> 27:29.149
to step out of my clock

27:29.232 --> 27:31.317
and do a little stretch.

27:31.401 --> 27:33.194
(Randall laughs)

27:33.278 --> 27:36.823
Maybe I'll read a book next.
Do you like reading books?

27:36.906 --> 27:38.450
Yes.

27:38.533 --> 27:41.161
They help us develop
our imaginations, don't they?

27:41.244 --> 27:44.414
Do you like using your imagination?

27:48.084 --> 27:50.837
I have imaginary parents.

27:52.922 --> 27:54.674
Well, that's okay.

27:54.758 --> 27:58.553
We all have our own
neighborhoods of make-believe.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.224
JACK:
Hey, Randall?

28:03.308 --> 28:04.726
Come on, let's go.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.440
Come on.

28:13.818 --> 28:15.820
Come on.

28:18.573 --> 28:20.116
I can't believe we looked for an hour,

28:20.200 --> 28:22.410
and they were in your freaking pocket.

28:22.494 --> 28:25.538
Do I have a bruise on my face?

28:25.622 --> 28:27.624
Nah.

28:27.707 --> 28:29.084
If something pops up, though,
it'll give you

28:29.167 --> 28:31.294
-a little character.
-Finally.

28:31.378 --> 28:33.046
(Randall chuckles)

28:35.632 --> 28:38.259
I got, uh... annoyed with you

28:38.343 --> 28:41.221
-in the, the cab...
-Yeah, I was being a dick.

28:41.304 --> 28:43.390
I get it.

28:43.473 --> 28:45.642
No...

28:45.725 --> 28:48.353
Well, yes.
You were being rude to the cab driver.

28:48.436 --> 28:50.313
Hmm.

28:50.397 --> 28:52.399
Th-The Black cab driver?

28:55.235 --> 28:57.487
Um, well, uh, I-I mean,

28:57.570 --> 28:59.614
I'm rude to all cabbies, man.

28:59.698 --> 29:02.033
It really doesn't matter
what color they are.

29:02.117 --> 29:05.078
That's kind of an oblivious thing to say.

29:07.997 --> 29:10.125
I-I don't, I don't see it that way, man.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.502
I...

29:12.585 --> 29:14.838
know you don't.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.841
Let's just talk about something else.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.722
Look, man, um...

29:25.682 --> 29:28.101
I was just trying to have
a good time with you.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.647
I'm gonna be honest.
Um...

29:32.731 --> 29:35.817
things have not been going
so great for me out here.

29:35.900 --> 29:38.069
What do you mean?

29:40.780 --> 29:43.366
The crap painting in my apartment...

29:43.450 --> 29:45.076
is mine.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.245
I did it.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.123
You know, I started painting
to try to express my feelings.

29:50.206 --> 29:53.418
My acting teacher, uh, thought it'd help.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.547
Um...

29:57.630 --> 30:00.175
I've been bombing all my auditions.

30:00.258 --> 30:02.886
I'm probably gonna bomb
the one tomorrow morning.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.096
And, um...

30:05.180 --> 30:07.849
my career is nowhere.

30:09.893 --> 30:12.103
And you have everything, Randall.

30:13.271 --> 30:14.981
Beth.

30:15.065 --> 30:18.068
Huge future.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.153
I'm just, uh,
the family failure, you know?

30:20.236 --> 30:23.281
I don't see it that way, Kev.

30:25.408 --> 30:27.577
I know you don't.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.662
(chuckles)

30:31.414 --> 30:33.541
Well, I got Hot Pockets inside

30:33.625 --> 30:35.168
if-if you want some.

30:35.251 --> 30:37.253
Yeah.

30:39.714 --> 30:41.758
(keys jingling)

30:52.352 --> 30:54.354
Phone's over there.

31:00.443 --> 31:02.445
(sputtering)

31:06.533 --> 31:08.535
You really wish you were never adopted?

31:11.287 --> 31:13.289
It's not that simple.

31:17.335 --> 31:19.337
Yeah.

31:21.131 --> 31:23.341
I remember when you found William.

31:25.427 --> 31:28.263
I think that's when I realized
you wanted something different.

31:32.642 --> 31:35.770
Look, man, I know...

31:35.854 --> 31:37.814
our experiences growing up
in our family were different.

31:37.897 --> 31:40.358
I know that.

31:40.442 --> 31:42.193
But I just...

31:42.277 --> 31:45.030
I don't see it the way that you do.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.451
You still paint?

31:51.619 --> 31:54.873
No, I...
You know, I haven't done that in a while.

31:54.956 --> 31:57.917
I always thought it was kind of cool,

31:58.001 --> 32:01.087
that you would tap
into your feelings by painting.

32:01.171 --> 32:02.630
Yeah.

32:02.714 --> 32:06.092
Creating a visual representation
of all the stuff

32:06.176 --> 32:07.886
going on inside you.

32:10.055 --> 32:12.057
I'm-a try and paint you a picture.

32:12.140 --> 32:14.142
-Okay?
-Okay.

32:15.393 --> 32:20.815
I started going to this support group
for transracial adoptees.

32:20.899 --> 32:26.237
They explained this term to me:
Ghost Kingdoms.

32:26.321 --> 32:28.615
It's like an alternate reality
in your mind

32:28.698 --> 32:30.909
where you imagine the life
you would have had

32:30.992 --> 32:34.329
if you were never adopted.

32:34.412 --> 32:39.626
And, um, I realized
that I've had this Ghost Kingdom

32:39.709 --> 32:41.544
my entire life.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.713
I just never had a name for it.

32:46.424 --> 32:48.927
Since I never knew
who my birth parents really were...

32:49.010 --> 32:51.763
-MARGARET: Randall?
<i>-RANDALL: I imagined</i><i>that the nice librarian</i>

32:51.846 --> 32:54.974
<i>from the neighborhood library</i>
<i>and the Black meteorologist</i>

32:55.058 --> 32:59.020
<i>on the local news were my parents.</i>

33:01.398 --> 33:03.566
The guy we always used
to pray to for snow days?

33:03.650 --> 33:05.568
-Yep.
-Yeah.

33:05.652 --> 33:08.029
And the librarian.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.366
She always let you check out

33:11.449 --> 33:12.992
more books than you were allowed.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.412
She did.

33:15.495 --> 33:17.956
They were the only two adults
that I consistently saw

33:18.039 --> 33:19.416
that looked like me.

33:22.335 --> 33:24.879
Now, this group told me that, uh,

33:24.963 --> 33:28.008
this is a pretty common thing.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.677
But back then I didn't know that.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.097
So picture me, Kev.
Picture me at five

33:34.180 --> 33:38.810
having the same type of fantasy
that a lot of kids have...

33:38.893 --> 33:42.355
but thinking I was doing something bad.

33:42.439 --> 33:43.815
But I wasn't.

33:43.898 --> 33:45.567
Was just going to an imaginary place

33:45.650 --> 33:48.486
that was supposed to be just for me.

33:48.570 --> 33:50.572
But that's not the full picture.

33:52.282 --> 33:56.202
Because I could never
fully escape into my fantasy.

33:57.328 --> 33:58.663
<i>'Cause I felt too guilty.</i>

34:01.207 --> 34:03.668

34:07.881 --> 34:09.424
REBECCA:
Perfect weather for who?

34:09.507 --> 34:12.677
JACK: For football.
Steelers always have an advantage

34:12.761 --> 34:13.887
in the snow.

34:13.970 --> 34:15.889
Hey, bud, come on.
