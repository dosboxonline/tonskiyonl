Gosh, Tobe, I want this so bad.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.161
-(exhales)
-I know.

08:56.244 --> 08:59.330
Now, are we in San Pee-dro or San Pay-dro?

08:59.414 --> 09:01.666
I-I don't want to come off
looking like a rube.

09:01.750 --> 09:02.751
-I think it's Pay-dro. Yeah.
-Pay-dro.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.419
-Pay-dro. San Pay-dro.
-Pay-dro. Yeah.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.588
-San Pay-dro.
-ELLIE: Kate and Toby?

09:06.671 --> 09:08.840
-Hi. (chuckles)
-KATE: (gasps) Hi! -Hi!

09:08.923 --> 09:10.258
-Hi, I'm-I'm Ellie.
-TOBY: Hi!

09:10.342 --> 09:11.426
Hi.
(chuckles)

09:11.509 --> 09:12.802
KATE:
How nice to meet you.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.262
ELLIE:
Yeah. Welcome to San Pee-dro.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.430
TOBY (quietly):
Pee-dro. Damn it.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.307
-KATE: 'Kay.
-Ha-ha!

09:17.390 --> 09:20.852
-That is an amazing mask. (chuckles)
-TOBY: Oh. (growls playfully)

09:24.814 --> 09:27.442
Stewart chose to be in
your project for a reason, Kate.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.194
He clearly still likes you.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.570
You think so?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.406
I have got snacks.
Nothing healthy.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.824
Only the fun stuff,

09:34.908 --> 09:36.701
-including Funyuns.
-Mom.

09:36.785 --> 09:37.786
Bagel Bites.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.788
Stewart loves Bagel Bites.

09:39.871 --> 09:42.374
Oh. How could I forget?

09:44.501 --> 09:46.044
-Thanks, Mom.
-Yeah.

09:46.127 --> 09:47.921
Hi, Randall.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.382
-Hey.
-We're building a desert biome.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.466
Want to see?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.093
No, I made that in third grade.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.427
(doorbell rings)

09:54.511 --> 09:55.762
Got it!

09:58.515 --> 10:00.642
Hi. I brought Play-Doh
for the cacti and aquarium sand

10:00.725 --> 10:02.769
-for the desert floor.
-Great. Come on in.

10:03.853 --> 10:04.896
(chuckles softly)

10:04.979 --> 10:05.897
<i>KATE:</i>
<i>By the way,</i>

10:05.980 --> 10:07.065
-I love your mask.
-Oh.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.525
Um, my family's from Pittsburgh.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.151
We are diehard Steelers fans.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.486
I know.
I saw it in your profile.

10:11.569 --> 10:12.987
I wore it as an homage.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.614
My dad is from Johnstown.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.824
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:15.907 --> 10:17.117
But don't tell me that you actually named

10:17.200 --> 10:18.159
your daughter Willow

10:18.243 --> 10:20.161
-after...
-Willow Rosenberg. Yes.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.414
-No way.
-Yes. Oh, I'm a huge <i>Buffy</i> fan.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.748
-Huge. Yes.
-What?

10:23.832 --> 10:24.958
-Okay. All right.
-(laughs)

10:25.041 --> 10:26.167
So can we adopt <i>you?</i>

10:26.251 --> 10:27.961
Can we, Tobe? Can we...?

10:28.044 --> 10:29.587
-You know?
-I'm free.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.006
Is that crazy?
Okay, it's crazy. All right...

10:31.089 --> 10:32.757
No, it's not, I just think we might

10:32.841 --> 10:34.384
have strayed from the topic here.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.593
Yes, sorry, sorry.

10:35.677 --> 10:38.179
Having too much fun, okay.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.557
Okay, so, um,

10:40.640 --> 10:44.144
why am I placing this child for adoption?

10:45.603 --> 10:47.689
I married my high school sweetheart,

10:47.772 --> 10:51.693
Willow's father, and I lost him to cancer.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.987
Oh.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.447
And it was...

10:55.530 --> 10:58.324
awful beyond awful,
so I don't want to dwell on it,

10:58.408 --> 11:01.369
except to say that it took me a few years

11:01.453 --> 11:04.873
to even think about another man,
let alone go out with one,

11:04.956 --> 11:07.250
in the middle of raising
my daughter by myself.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.918
But all of my girlfriends

11:09.002 --> 11:11.129
said that it was time for me
to get back out there.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.131
So I went on Match

11:13.214 --> 11:16.509
and I met up with this handsome stranger

11:16.593 --> 11:18.803
and there were drinks,

11:18.887 --> 11:22.682
a lot of drinks, and I ended up in his bed

11:22.766 --> 11:25.727
about five hours after learning his name.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.107
You must think I'm so messed up.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.444
Not at all.

11:34.527 --> 11:38.198
Trust me, I have thought about this.

11:38.281 --> 11:40.408
I have thought about this
more than I have ever thought

11:40.492 --> 11:42.327
about anything else in my whole life.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.162
And...

11:44.245 --> 11:47.248
this baby will do better
if she is raised elsewhere.

11:47.332 --> 11:51.961
With parents who... really want her.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.509
(laughs): And it'll make me feel
like I'm doing something right.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.261
-(phone plays "Ghostbusters")
-Oh.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.013
I am so sorry.
That is my mom.

12:02.097 --> 12:04.557
She's watching Willow today,
so just one sec. Sorry.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.518
♪ <i>Ghostbusters!</i> ♪

12:06.601 --> 12:08.645
(whispering): When there's something
strange in the neighborhood.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.689
-She has "Ghostbusters." What?
-I know.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.273
It's like... it's like she's combed

12:12.357 --> 12:14.484
through our social media or something.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.404
It's validating that she has
exquisite taste in pop culture,

12:17.487 --> 12:19.781
-but we should exercise caution.
-I am so sorry.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.491
-No, it's okay.
-My child is having a meltdown,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.284
so, uh, I may have to wind this up

12:23.368 --> 12:25.036
-just a little sooner than I wanted.
-KATE: Oh, no.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.080
Like, got to call a Lyft in, like, 15.

12:27.163 --> 12:30.709
-Oh. All right, well...
-I mean, we could take you,

12:30.792 --> 12:32.544
-if you want, right, Tobe?
-Oh, no, you don't need to do that.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.088
No, it's fine. Like...

12:35.171 --> 12:37.841
-Okay, all right, then. Well,
that buys us more time. -Let's roll.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.300

12:54.065 --> 12:55.900
My wife's the one who turned me on to him.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.819
(clears throat)
She's a big fan.

13:00.572 --> 13:03.366
Beth's her name-- my wife.

13:03.450 --> 13:06.036
She's Black. Just so you know,
I'm married to a Black woman,

Uh... (laughs)

13:19.507 --> 13:22.052
I'm a little nervous.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.720
I know I told you this morning

13:23.803 --> 13:26.639

Whew!

14:05.887 --> 14:08.223
-All right, I'm all yours.
-(claps hands)

14:08.306 --> 14:10.016
Yeah, you've probably never
heard of the director before.

14:10.100 --> 14:12.143
His name is Jordan Martin Foster.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.562
He won the Jury Prize at Cannes.

14:18.316 --> 14:19.609
Are you okay?

14:19.693 --> 14:21.319
Yeah, fine.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.117
Just so you know: sex scenes
couldn't be less sexy.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.868
Okay? And I'm not even kidding.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.286
I mean, you got crew members

14:30.370 --> 14:31.746
standing around all over the place.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.164
Plus, with COVID now, I don't even know

14:33.248 --> 14:34.708
if we'll be in the same studio.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.167
For all I know,
I'll be in Burbank somewhere,

14:36.251 --> 14:37.544
she'll be in Culver City, and they'll just

14:37.627 --> 14:39.045
throw us together in post.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.338
You got nothing to worry about.

14:40.422 --> 14:41.798
I'm not worried about it.
Let's go back.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.009
-My feet hurt.
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.512
I'm so sorry. I just wanted
to say I am a big fan.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.305
-Oh, thank you.
-Um, Julia.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.724
-Hi.
-Could I get a picture?

14:50.807 --> 14:52.308
Okay.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.228
Oh. Wow. Congratulations.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.813
How many weeks do you have to go?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.315
-Um, just a few months.
-Oh, lucky girl.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.735
You just have the cute
little basketball belly.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.195
Me? My son's a year old,
I'm still running it off.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.698
Uh... let's get

15:06.781 --> 15:08.199
that socially-distanced selfie, right?

15:08.283 --> 15:09.951
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.872

-There you go. All right.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.248
-Thanks.
-It's a good one. Thank you.

Madison! Hey, hey.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.710
Madison? Listen,
if you're upset with me...

15:18.793 --> 15:21.880
-I'm not.
-Okay, listen, you can come

15:21.963 --> 15:23.715
to the filming of the love scene
if that's really

15:23.798 --> 15:25.467
-what's bothering you.
-I am not upset about the love scene.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.801
It seems like you're upset
about the love scene.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.094
I'm not upset about the love scene!

15:28.178 --> 15:30.013
I'm upset about the pancakes.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.973
I'm upset that she can tell I'm pregnant.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.641
Okay, I'm-I'm upset
about a whole bunch of stuff

15:33.725 --> 15:35.060
I'm not comfortable sharing with you

15:35.143 --> 15:37.020
because we're basically strangers.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.233
(sighs softly)

15:44.819 --> 15:46.404
Don't follow me.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.948
I'm walking back to the house.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.950
Go a different way.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.243
(mumbles)

15:53.912 --> 15:56.873
I'm so sorry. Could I get
another? I-I blinked.

15:58.083 --> 16:00.085
What?

16:03.171 --> 16:05.590
(bird squawking)

16:07.217 --> 16:09.594
The oil's boiling.

16:09.678 --> 16:13.056
Say it again in Vietnamese.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.059
You said we only have to speak Vietnamese

16:16.142 --> 16:17.686
when we are fishing.

16:17.769 --> 16:21.314
You always get the last word

16:21.398 --> 16:23.233
in every language.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.403
Everything takes so long.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.780
Fishing the fish, cooking the fish.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.490
Let's play Go Fish.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.034
You need to learn patience, Linh.

16:33.118 --> 16:37.330
Preparing a meal is the way
to show someone you love them.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.082
I learned to cook

16:39.165 --> 16:41.793
because I want to impress
someone very special to me.

16:41.876 --> 16:43.461
Who?

16:43.545 --> 16:46.214
So many questions in such a little body.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.299
Sit.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.095
I will not tell you who I cook for,

16:52.178 --> 16:54.931
but I will show you how I cook for her.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.727
Her! It's a girl.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.146
Sit.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.814

<i>Yeah, well, we don't go in</i>

17:05.942 --> 17:07.777

17:10.363 --> 17:13.241
<i>So, you, uh,</i>
<i>didn't find anything, did you?</i>

17:13.324 --> 17:15.243
<i>-Such as?</i>
<i>-Nothing. I mean,</i>

17:15.326 --> 17:17.245
<i>-I just lost Inky's ball.</i>
<i>-Inky?</i>

17:17.328 --> 17:19.080
I love <i>Mr. Belvedere.</i>

17:19.164 --> 17:22.334
Although I'm more
of a <i>Who's the Boss?</i> girl.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.756
I bet you're the brainiac that
doesn't need to do homework.

17:27.839 --> 17:30.884
You just watch TV all day and get all As.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.969
I have a routine.

17:33.053 --> 17:36.681
Snack, watch <i>Mr. Bel,</i>
and then do my homework.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.476
I'm in the middle of my routine right now.

17:44.189 --> 17:45.857
-Fine.
-Fine?

17:45.940 --> 17:48.651
Coach said we've got another
Terry Bradshaw right here.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.070
Minus the hair loss.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.529
-Yeah, of course.
-Obviously, Kevin.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.198
Hey, you know what else Coach said?

17:53.281 --> 17:55.283
Kev gets a little stronger,
he's gonna be a force.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.161
So I'm gonna take him out in
the garage, pump a little iron.

17:58.244 --> 18:01.289
Oh. The garage. Dad's sanctuary.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.541
-Okay. -Go upstairs and change,
all right?

18:03.625 --> 18:06.294
-(laughs)
-What's going on here?

18:06.378 --> 18:09.047
Study group.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.132
Studying what?

18:11.216 --> 18:13.385
Relax. They're fine, Jack.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.011
Really? You're not gonna meddle?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.389
No, no, no, no. Meddling was
so Seventh Grade Rebecca.

18:17.472 --> 18:18.932
-This is Eighth Grade Rebecca.
-Oh.

18:19.015 --> 18:20.850
Cool Mom Rebecca.

18:20.934 --> 18:24.521
You know, I can monitor the
situation, but in a cool way.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.107
-Okay. Yeah, Cool Mom.
-Cool Mom.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.608
Cool Mom.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.652
-Hey, babe.
-Yeah.

18:30.735 --> 18:33.571
You really think it's okay
for Kev to be pumping iron?

18:33.655 --> 18:36.866
I mean, teens' bones and muscles
are still developing.

18:36.950 --> 18:39.869
Say the thing you want to say.

18:39.953 --> 18:43.206
No. Cool Mom Rebecca doesn't meddle.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.792
Okay. I-I got this.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.712
Yeah, it's really cute.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.588
He, like, has his own
little made-up language.

18:50.672 --> 18:52.757
-(Ellie laughs)
-And everything rhymes.

18:52.841 --> 18:55.593
It's really cute.
Oh, hey, Tobe, the sitter said

18:55.677 --> 18:57.095
that she can't find any diapers.

18:57.178 --> 18:58.638
Yeah, well, you bought some yesterday.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.432
-Yeah. Yeah, I did.
-Well, where are they?

19:00.515 --> 19:02.100
I don't know.
You brought the groceries in.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.936
Okay.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.064
Ugh. Come on, Tobe.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.608
You were supposed to check the
diaper supply before we left.

19:10.692 --> 19:11.985
No, I checked the diaper supply yesterday

19:12.068 --> 19:13.653
and saw that we were low

19:13.737 --> 19:15.530
and wrote "diapers" on the shopping list.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.615
Right, and then I bought
the diapers that were

19:17.699 --> 19:19.284
on the shopping list, and
you were supposed to take them

19:19.367 --> 19:21.119
-out of the trunk. -We wouldn't run
out of diapers so fast

19:21.202 --> 19:23.288
if we could please just buy in bulk.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.415
I'm not gonna hoard diapers, Tobe.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.334
Like, other people need diapers, too.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.961
I'm not talking about buying
all of the diapers in the world,

19:30.045 --> 19:31.504
but this kid is a human outhouse.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.423
Maybe if we just get, like,
an extra box or two.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.051
Okay, so it's my fault? It would
be really great, just, like,

19:36.134 --> 19:38.136
one time if you could be like, "My fault,"

19:38.219 --> 19:39.846
like you took the blame
just for something.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.056
Just like, "Hey, it was me."

19:41.139 --> 19:43.224
I take the blame for everything.

19:43.308 --> 19:47.103
I am this family's blame piñata!
Pow!

19:47.187 --> 19:49.773
Blame scattered on the floor.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.483
Blame piñata.

19:51.566 --> 19:52.776
That's good.

19:52.859 --> 19:55.403
Thanks, it felt good
rolling off the tongue.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.322
I'm sorry I left the diapers in the trunk.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.948
-I'm an idiot.
-Babe, you're not an idiot.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.867
And we both know that,
uh, we've had our son

20:00.950 --> 20:02.619
sit in his diaper for
a lot longer than this, so...

20:02.702 --> 20:04.871
(laughs) Yeah, I actually think
he likes it.

20:04.954 --> 20:06.581
'Cause he's gross.
(laughs)

20:06.664 --> 20:08.792
(Toby sighs)

20:12.671 --> 20:14.339
-Ready?
-Yes.

Does this make you uneasy?

20:53.712 --> 20:55.171
Does this make you uncomfortable?

Ms. Jennings touched my hair,

21:13.440 --> 21:15.900
-then kept doing it to other kids.
-BETH: Tess,

21:15.984 --> 21:17.152
if a teacher touched your hair,

21:17.235 --> 21:18.445
you know what, you should have gone

21:18.528 --> 21:19.946
to that teacher,
or you should have come to us.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.448
You do not post

21:21.531 --> 21:24.159
a profane, mocking dance video

21:24.242 --> 21:25.535
for the world to see.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.120
I did tell the teacher.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.664
I said, "Please don't touch my hair."

21:29.748 --> 21:31.332
RANDALL:
And did she stop?

21:31.416 --> 21:32.792
She stopped with me.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.544
But not with all the other Black students.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.504
Well, Tess, the other students
aren't your problem.

21:36.588 --> 21:38.173
Silence in the face of injustice

21:38.256 --> 21:40.133
is complicity with the oppressor.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.135
Okay, the teachers didn't get the message

21:42.218 --> 21:44.804
when we asked nicely, but they
definitely got the message now.

21:44.888 --> 21:45.805
BETH:
Hey.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.515
Check the attitude, okay, Tess?

21:47.599 --> 21:50.060
Now, this Alex, did she make you do this?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.562
Alex is not a she.
They're a they.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.397
Fine. They.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.650
No one made me do anything.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.405
You tell me to be myself.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.116
Well, this is me now, guys.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.786
Have you seen
what's going on in the world?

22:07.869 --> 22:11.539
I'm done waiting to figure out who I am.

22:11.623 --> 22:15.418
I'm done being the prissy,
quiet little girl

22:15.502 --> 22:17.504
you raised in the straight, white suburbs

22:17.587 --> 22:20.507
surrounded by straight, white people.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.510
This is who I want to be.

22:23.593 --> 22:25.762
This is who I am.

22:28.556 --> 22:31.142
Go to your room, Tess.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.740
So this'll go right here.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.952
Stewart, we can stop pretending
why you picked my study group.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.287
I miss you, too.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.915
I picked your group
because I like deserts.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.667
This is where the action is.

22:55.750 --> 22:58.962
Snakes, Gila monsters,

22:59.045 --> 23:01.047
scorpions.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.760
(TV playing quietly)

23:14.686 --> 23:16.271
(lips smack)

23:16.354 --> 23:18.148
It's crazy.
This tastes just like root beer.

23:18.231 --> 23:19.983
Want to try?

23:22.152 --> 23:25.447
I should really get to my homework.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.871
That's an angry pour.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.878
<i>Grazie.</i>

23:39.961 --> 23:41.588
What's that?

23:41.671 --> 23:43.506
It's a journal for Dr. Vance.

23:43.590 --> 23:46.551
Supposed to write down a story
about my childhood.

23:46.634 --> 23:50.472
Can only imagine what Tess
is gonna write about us someday.

23:50.555 --> 23:52.807
She's lashing out.

23:52.891 --> 23:55.018
She should know better.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.479
The Internet has a long memory.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.189
We taught her to know better, Randall.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.149
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

24:01.232 --> 24:04.069
And as a parent, I agree with you.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.821
She did not go about this the right way,

24:06.905 --> 24:11.159
but-- and just stay with me here...

24:11.242 --> 24:13.453
part of me is kind of proud of her.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.872
Oh.
(laughs)

24:15.955 --> 24:18.500
If something bothered me
when I was her age,

24:18.583 --> 24:20.502
I swallowed it.

24:20.585 --> 24:23.755
I've always been worried
that Tess was like me.

24:23.838 --> 24:26.841
You know, internal. Anxious.

24:26.925 --> 24:29.636
But all of a sudden,

24:29.719 --> 24:32.472
she's coming into her own.

24:32.555 --> 24:35.100
She's not afraid of who she is.

24:35.183 --> 24:37.143
She's not gonna have to go
see a therapist at 40

24:37.227 --> 24:38.269
to figure that out.

24:38.353 --> 24:41.898
-I know. And I hear you.
-Mm-hmm.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.442
But they are teenagers now, husband.

24:44.526 --> 24:45.860
-Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

24:45.944 --> 24:47.904
This is what we have been training for.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.198
-(chuckles softly)
-There has got to be consequences

24:50.281 --> 24:52.367
for what she's done. All right?

24:52.450 --> 24:56.579
And strong parenting is not
playing good cop, bad cop.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.958
We have to be on the same page.

25:00.041 --> 25:01.668
Starting now.

25:04.087 --> 25:08.258
So you want me to go talk to her?

25:08.341 --> 25:10.343
Ding, ding, ding.

25:13.388 --> 25:14.889
-TOBY: No, just pull it once.
-ELLIE: Maybe. No. Hold on.

25:14.973 --> 25:16.558
-TOBY: Just pull it once. Yeah.
-ELLIE: I'm sorry. (laughs)

25:16.641 --> 25:18.351
-There you go. (laughs)
-(Kate laughs)

25:18.435 --> 25:20.687
-Thank you for the ride.
This was fun. -(Toby clears throat)

25:20.770 --> 25:24.024
Oh, i-i-it was. Yeah.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.735
Uh...

25:26.818 --> 25:29.904
and I'm sorry if our arguing
made you feel uncomfortable.

25:29.988 --> 25:32.866
I mean, we actually
get along very well, so...

25:32.949 --> 25:34.784
Yeah, which works out good,
'cause we're married.

25:34.868 --> 25:35.910
(Kate and Ellie laugh)

25:35.994 --> 25:37.912
Well, Doug-- my husband--

25:37.996 --> 25:40.874
he used to overbuy condiments.

25:40.957 --> 25:43.418
It was as if he lived in perpetual fear

25:43.501 --> 25:44.669
of running out of mustard.

25:44.753 --> 25:46.171
(chuckles):
It drove me nuts,

25:46.254 --> 25:49.215
and we fought about it constantly.

25:49.299 --> 25:52.510
-Mustard-gate.
Ketchup-gate. Mayo-gate. -(chuckles)

25:52.594 --> 25:55.096
Mayo-gate was, uh,
it was especially bad. (laughs)

25:55.180 --> 25:57.182
-(chuckles) -I think you can tell a lot
about a couple

25:57.265 --> 25:59.017
by how they fight.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.227
How they recover.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.732
I have a strong feeling about you guys.

26:06.983 --> 26:08.902
Thanks for coming
all the way to San Pedro.

26:08.985 --> 26:10.695
-Yeah.
-Oh, of course. Our pleasure.

26:10.779 --> 26:12.197
Yeah, love San Pedro.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.282
(laughing):
"We love San Pedro."

26:14.366 --> 26:16.242
Okay, bye.

26:16.326 --> 26:17.243
See you.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.162
Bye.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.926
KEVIN:
Hey. How you feeling?

26:33.009 --> 26:35.970
Fine. Soaked my feet.

26:36.054 --> 26:38.640
Oh, good. Good.

26:40.642 --> 26:43.436
-So, I-I didn't mean to, uh...
-Don't.

26:43.520 --> 26:45.355
You did nothing wrong.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.190
I said something. I don't...

26:47.273 --> 26:50.026
Was it about the movie
or the babies? Uh...

26:52.696 --> 26:55.615
I had an eating disorder, Kevin.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.158
I'm not sure how much you know,

26:57.242 --> 27:00.245
but I've been struggling
with eating issues

27:00.328 --> 27:03.790
for as long as I can remember, and, um...

27:03.873 --> 27:06.876
then comes this pregnancy.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.757
You know why that ultrasound
picture is on the fridge

27:12.841 --> 27:17.053
and not on a bulletin board
or a bathroom mirror?

27:17.137 --> 27:19.472
I keep that there

27:19.556 --> 27:23.560
to remind me to eat.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.647
To eat food, Kev.

27:27.731 --> 27:30.734
To eat food to keep our babies healthy.

27:32.736 --> 27:34.779
Do you know when I go to the doctor,

27:34.863 --> 27:36.948
the first thing they do is weigh me?

27:37.032 --> 27:39.701
And they announce the number out loud,

27:39.784 --> 27:42.203
and I have to remind myself

27:42.287 --> 27:44.789
to act proud that I've put on two pounds

27:44.873 --> 27:47.500
when for most of my adult life,

27:47.584 --> 27:50.837
news like that would just make me spiral.

27:52.922 --> 27:55.342
It's hard to adjust.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.263
I didn't know.

28:03.266 --> 28:05.268
Of course you didn't.

28:06.686 --> 28:10.023
I've been hiding a lot of myself from you.

28:10.106 --> 28:13.026
This whole thing isn't normal, Kev,

28:13.109 --> 28:15.653
as much as we pretend it is.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.655
Everything came backwards here,

28:17.739 --> 28:20.950
and I'm all over the place.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.869
Insecurities running wild,

28:22.952 --> 28:24.996
and-and you're walking around

28:25.080 --> 28:27.332
like an Olympic swimmer most of the time.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.251
I'm sorry.

28:31.753 --> 28:34.089
I'm fine.

28:34.172 --> 28:37.175
I love our babies.

28:39.386 --> 28:42.305
I'm just dealing with a lot right now.

28:42.389 --> 28:44.391
It's on me.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.487
All right.
(sighs)

28:57.570 --> 28:59.406
You ready?

28:59.489 --> 29:00.824
(Austrian accent):
I am Hans.

29:00.907 --> 29:02.409
(Austrian accent):
And I am Franz.

29:02.492 --> 29:05.370
BOTH:
And we want to pump you up!

29:05.453 --> 29:07.163
(both laugh)

29:07.247 --> 29:08.873
-(regular voice): Okay. Let's, uh...
-(weight scrapes)

29:08.957 --> 29:11.668
You know, let's start with just the bar.

29:11.751 --> 29:13.211
'Cause, you know, you're still
developing and everything.

29:13.294 --> 29:15.005
Come on, man, throw in some lead.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.673
No, Kev, come on.

29:16.756 --> 29:20.468
The bar is-is plenty heavy.
All right? But first,

29:20.552 --> 29:22.887
what I want you to do is,
you got to warm up.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.514
Right?
We got to loosen things up.

29:24.597 --> 29:27.058
Pull your arm through.
Warm your shoulders up.

29:27.142 --> 29:29.310
There you go. Yeah.
Go the other arm. All right.

29:29.394 --> 29:32.647
Go across. Go across.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.233
-(inhales, exhales forcefully)
-(exhales forcefully)

29:35.316 --> 29:36.985
(Jack laughs)

29:37.068 --> 29:38.778
All right, here we go.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.238
-(knuckles crack)
-(grunts)

29:40.321 --> 29:41.823
Knuckle popping is optional.

29:41.906 --> 29:44.075
-(knuckles crack)
-All right.

29:47.537 --> 29:49.873
KATE:
Stewart's a desert groupie, Mom.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.459
That's why he wanted to be
in our study project.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.294
-It wasn't to be with me.
-REBECCA: Oh.

29:54.377 --> 29:55.879
I see.

29:55.962 --> 29:57.797
I feel like an idiot.

29:57.881 --> 30:01.009
No, don't.

30:01.092 --> 30:04.554
Following your heart
is a real strength, Kate.

30:04.637 --> 30:08.058
Yeah, sometimes you end up getting hurt,

30:08.141 --> 30:09.934
but most of the time,

30:10.018 --> 30:12.937
it'll all work out.

30:13.021 --> 30:15.690
I know it's not the cool thing to say,

30:15.774 --> 30:19.152
but I'm really proud of you,

30:19.235 --> 30:21.029
and I love you.

30:31.873 --> 30:36.586
TOBY: All right. Emergency
diaper stash restocked.

30:36.670 --> 30:38.254
(Kate laughs)

30:38.338 --> 30:41.174
-Ah...
-What's so funny?

30:41.257 --> 30:45.720
Oh, uh, Ellie said the <i>Buffy</i>
episode "Hush" was on, so...

30:47.347 --> 30:49.224
Babe, "Hush"?

30:49.307 --> 30:50.266
The one where everyone in Sunnydale

30:50.350 --> 30:52.227
loses the ability to talk?

30:52.310 --> 30:54.646
Do not insult me.
I know the episode.

30:54.729 --> 30:56.523
-Please.
-Excuse me.

30:56.606 --> 30:59.359
But c-could we just not

30:59.442 --> 31:01.861
-text her as much, please?
-She texted me.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.782
Come on.
Just admit, it went well.

31:05.865 --> 31:07.534
And could you just be a little excited

31:07.617 --> 31:08.618
-about that?
-Not really.

31:08.702 --> 31:10.870
This baby stuff wasn't that easy
the first time.

31:10.954 --> 31:12.414
You know, with this, we're dealing

31:12.497 --> 31:14.708
with a 33-year-old single mother

31:14.791 --> 31:16.918
who could, literally, at any moment,

31:17.002 --> 31:19.504
change her mind about us.

31:19.587 --> 31:21.506
So instead of asking me
to be more excited,

31:21.589 --> 31:24.467
could maybe you... you try
to be a little more terrified?

31:24.551 --> 31:27.178
(sighs)
Okay.

31:28.430 --> 31:31.850
You know what, she does smile
a lot when she rubs her belly.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.894
Which is better than
the opposite, obviously,

31:34.978 --> 31:37.188
but I don't know, I clocked it.

31:37.272 --> 31:39.482
-Oh, babe.
-See? Thank you.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.276
Thank-- no, that makes me feel better.

31:41.359 --> 31:45.655
Thank you for registering
an acceptable level of terror.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.532
-Mm.
-I appreciate it.

31:47.615 --> 31:48.908
Yeah, okay, you're welcome.

31:48.992 --> 31:53.121
She did say that her favorite
<i>Star Wars</i> character

31:53.204 --> 31:54.581
was Babu Frik.

31:54.664 --> 31:56.750
That's a fresh take. Respect.

31:56.833 --> 31:59.878
And did you see the look
on her face when she noticed

31:59.961 --> 32:01.921
that we had forgotten
the diapers in the car?

32:02.005 --> 32:05.717
That was the look of a woman
who is falling hard for us.

32:05.800 --> 32:08.636
-Babe.
-Yeah. Those are good things.

32:08.720 --> 32:11.556
-Those are good things.
-Okay, well, thank you

32:11.639 --> 32:14.893
for registering a, you know, an
acceptable level of excitement.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.978
Thank you.

32:17.062 --> 32:19.731
Also, I, um, bought the diapers,
for the record.

32:19.814 --> 32:22.942
-You left 'em in the trunk.
-(laughs): Uh...

32:23.026 --> 32:24.027
Uh, excuse me.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.571
(knocking on door)

32:26.654 --> 32:28.114
RANDALL:
"Come in."

32:28.198 --> 32:31.201
"Oh, thanks, daughter,
don't-don't mind if I do."

32:35.955 --> 32:38.124
(sighs)

32:45.757 --> 32:48.218
"Silence in the face of inequality

32:48.301 --> 32:50.470
is complicity with the oppressor."

32:50.553 --> 32:53.306
-Ginetta Sagan.
-You caught that.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.392
I catch everything, daughter.

32:59.104 --> 33:00.855
There's a right way and a wrong way

33:00.939 --> 33:02.941
to get your point across.

33:03.024 --> 33:06.444
Even loudly, if need be.

33:06.528 --> 33:09.114
And this was the wrong way.

33:09.197 --> 33:11.032
And it's not you.

33:11.116 --> 33:14.703
Telling adults to screw
themself on the Internet?

33:14.786 --> 33:15.870
-That's not you.
-It is me.

33:15.954 --> 33:17.163
It's not.

33:18.540 --> 33:22.836
That is not the person
who made my life somersault.

33:26.423 --> 33:29.050
-It's an old reference.
-I remember.

33:34.973 --> 33:37.350
We're taking your phone away
for six weeks.

33:37.434 --> 33:39.978
What? What if I'm out?

33:40.061 --> 33:42.147
You won't be, 'cause you're
grounded for six weeks, too.

33:42.230 --> 33:43.898
Fascist! This is bull...

33:43.982 --> 33:46.609
You finish that sentence,
tack on three more weeks.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.657
Good choice.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.454
God.

33:58.538 --> 34:00.081
(door closes)

34:03.209 --> 34:04.919
Did she call you a fascist?

34:05.003 --> 34:06.671
Yeah, hon.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.423
-I believe she did.
-Mm.

34:12.844 --> 34:16.389
What you want to do is
you line your thumbs up, okay?

34:16.473 --> 34:17.974
Make sure that bar is nice and center.

34:18.058 --> 34:21.019
Wrap them around the bar.
Very important.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.772
Thumb around the bar. Important.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.399
Come on.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.069
Come on.

34:29.152 --> 34:30.236
-Come on.
-(exhales sharply)

34:30.320 --> 34:31.863
Nice, Kev. You're doing great.

34:31.946 --> 34:33.156
Last one, Kev. Last one.
Here we go.

34:33.239 --> 34:34.949
Push it, push it, push it.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.951
Push it.

34:37.035 --> 34:38.244
Work that chest.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.246
Push. Push.

34:40.330 --> 34:41.956
Push. Push, push, push, push,

34:42.040 --> 34:43.750
push, push, push.
Yeah, hey.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.044
-All right, let's pull this up.
-No, don't touch it.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.462
What's it, too heavy?
I could take some weight off.

34:47.545 --> 34:50.423
-No, I got it.
-Well, come on. Man up.

34:50.507 --> 34:52.008
-(exhales) -JACK: Come on, Kev,
you're good.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.344

34:54.427 --> 34:56.721
(exhales)

34:56.805 --> 34:58.014
Good.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.267
(chuckles):
Look at you.

35:01.351 --> 35:03.103
You're a monster.

35:03.186 --> 35:05.397
I did it.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.482
Hey, look, Kev.

35:08.942 --> 35:12.612
You put your mind to it,
you can accomplish anything.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.365
Okay?

35:21.830 --> 35:24.290
I'm playing a trial lawyer.

35:25.375 --> 35:28.253
In the movie I-I play a trial lawyer.

35:28.336 --> 35:31.047
Let me ask you a question.

35:31.131 --> 35:33.675
Why does a trial lawyer need to be ripped?

35:34.759 --> 35:36.678
I don't know.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.763
He doesn't.

35:40.598 --> 35:42.559
(exhales)

35:42.642 --> 35:45.395
I count calories, too, Madison.

35:47.022 --> 35:49.315
And I panic inside if I don't get

35:49.399 --> 35:51.443
a second workout in every single day.

35:51.526 --> 35:54.195
And I prefer sweating in a dingy garage

35:54.279 --> 35:58.658
than going
to some celebrity gym because...

35:58.742 --> 35:59.993
(sighs)

36:02.037 --> 36:04.831
Oh, God, so many reasons, actually.

36:04.914 --> 36:06.624
This one's stronger, right here.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.251
Put your hand right there.
Strong...

36:08.335 --> 36:12.672
Eight, nine,

36:12.756 --> 36:14.549
ten.

36:14.632 --> 36:15.800
Switch it up.

36:15.884 --> 36:17.635
Flex that!

36:17.719 --> 36:19.596
At the top.

36:19.679 --> 36:22.265
Yeah, you did it!

36:22.349 --> 36:25.310
-(laughs)
-My boy's gonna be a beast.

36:26.770 --> 36:30.273
And as an actor,
it just became my currency.

36:30.357 --> 36:33.943
I actually... got famous...

36:35.195 --> 36:37.155
...by taking my shirt off.

36:40.492 --> 36:44.204
(sighs) I'm getting older
and it's getting harder.

36:45.288 --> 36:47.540
And I'm not drinking anymore,
which is my other addiction,

36:47.624 --> 36:50.794
so I just come in here and I just--

36:50.877 --> 36:55.507
I channel all of that here,
and it's, uh...

36:56.675 --> 36:58.635
...not exactly healthy.

37:00.929 --> 37:03.473
I got stuff, too, Madison.

37:03.556 --> 37:06.101
I got a lot of stuff.

37:08.144 --> 37:10.939
Including stuff with my brother
that I still have to work out.

37:11.022 --> 37:13.024
And I...

37:16.194 --> 37:19.114
I lay in bed sometimes and I, um...

37:20.824 --> 37:23.910
...I just stare at the ceiling
and I worry.

37:23.993 --> 37:25.995
(sighs)

37:27.205 --> 37:30.834
I worry that I'm gonna pass all
that on to my kids, you know?

37:30.917 --> 37:33.962
All that...

37:34.045 --> 37:36.423
My unhealthy stuff.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.010
Me too.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.898
You know, I suppose being parents

37:53.982 --> 37:56.568
is gonna be hard enough on its own,

37:56.651 --> 37:59.029
without us walking around trying to be

37:59.112 --> 38:01.531
polite strangers in front of each other.

38:04.200 --> 38:07.078
I mean, I had the greatest,
most connected parents

38:07.162 --> 38:11.458
you can imagine, and they missed so much.

with daddy issues.

40:04.696 --> 40:06.448
Also, sometimes I get foot corns,

40:06.531 --> 40:08.033
and when that baby
flares up in the summer,

40:08.116 --> 40:10.160
I've been known to wear
shoes and socks at the beach.

40:19.461 --> 40:22.756
It's bulimia.

40:36.519 --> 40:39.689
I have a handle on it,

40:39.773 --> 40:42.317
but even now, sometimes,
my daily state of mind

40:42.400 --> 40:45.779
is still determined by my weight.
