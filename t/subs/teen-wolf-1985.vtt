WEBVTT

02:35.352 --> 02:37.047
Come on, ref, foul!

02:41.125 --> 02:42.353
Good one!

02:50.968 --> 02:51.935
Time!

02:52.503 --> 02:53.834
Time!

02:57.708 --> 02:59.005
All right!

02:59.743 --> 03:01.210
You guys suck.

03:03.547 --> 03:05.037
No, really?

03:06.150 --> 03:07.947
Come on, let's go!

03:08.886 --> 03:11.946
Looking good. Way to go.
Nothing to worry about. It's fine.

03:12.056 --> 03:14.047
No problem. Hot out there, isn't it?

03:14.158 --> 03:17.127
- Shouldn't have got in his way.
- Looking good out there!

03:17.227 --> 03:18.888
How would you know?

03:19.263 --> 03:21.390
You want to forfeit the game?

03:21.598 --> 03:23.691
Yeah. What's wrong with that?

03:23.800 --> 03:25.166
- No!
- No?

03:25.269 --> 03:28.830
My boys have league scoring records
at stake. It wouldn't be fair to them.

03:28.939 --> 03:31.430
If we quit now, we'd beat the 5:00 traffic.

03:31.542 --> 03:35.672
- There's a lot to learn from losing.
- We'll play, if it's that big a deal to you.

03:44.555 --> 03:46.045
- Pick me!
- Over here!

03:46.290 --> 03:48.758
- Push it up!
- All right, set it up!

03:50.627 --> 03:52.185
It's not going too well, is it?

03:52.296 --> 03:54.764
What do you expect?
Look at their sneakers.

03:54.865 --> 03:58.426
If we had those sneakers,
there's no telling what we could do.

03:58.802 --> 03:59.769
Shoot it!

04:01.605 --> 04:03.038
We're all open!

04:03.307 --> 04:04.501
Jump it!

04:05.175 --> 04:07.143
That fat kid's got a great arm.

04:09.813 --> 04:11.440
Over here, pass it!

04:15.753 --> 04:17.310
Forget it, dork!

04:51.555 --> 04:52.715
Nice try!

04:54.224 --> 04:56.590
Good game.
Come on, I want to get out of here.

04:57.094 --> 04:59.153
Come on, it's not that bad!

04:59.429 --> 05:02.262
First game of the season, 11 more to go.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.024
It's just a game!

05:04.168 --> 05:07.501
You bozos better shape up.
I can't do this all by myself.

05:08.205 --> 05:10.105
What is that, liverwurst?

05:10.207 --> 05:11.333
What?

05:11.440 --> 05:14.342
Thought you were supposed
to be on a diet, Chub.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.878
I don't know what you're talking about.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.845
Chub, look at this.

05:26.857 --> 05:30.020
Give me that!
Stop snooping around in my locker.

05:30.127 --> 05:33.927
Look, Chub, big guy,
I can smell that liverwurst from over there.

05:34.030 --> 05:36.795
Yeah, right. Underneath these?

05:38.235 --> 05:40.931
All right! Yeah, great game, guys!

05:41.038 --> 05:42.972
- We showed them.
- We lost, Stiles!

05:43.073 --> 05:45.837
- Umpire needed glasses. Terrific, Brad.
- Cheeseball.

05:45.943 --> 05:48.173
Scotto, you know that $7 you owe me?

05:48.278 --> 05:50.178
- You owe me.
- This is important.

05:50.280 --> 05:52.908
If I don't find a keg, I can't go to that party.

05:53.016 --> 05:55.280
Even if you get the cash,
where will you buy it?

05:55.385 --> 05:56.409
- Lend me $5.
- Later.

05:56.520 --> 05:57.851
- $2.
- Later.

05:57.988 --> 06:01.822
Chub, how's the diet?
Lemonade, give me five, man!

06:01.925 --> 06:04.416
You were terrific out there!

06:05.429 --> 06:07.192
What the hell is that?

06:10.600 --> 06:14.298
Lemonade, my man! What it is?

06:14.538 --> 06:19.305
Listen, I'm raising cash for our school's
Afro-American festival and thought...

06:19.610 --> 06:20.838
Mick, can we talk?

06:32.489 --> 06:33.854
Come on in.

06:35.058 --> 06:37.822
Great game.
You want a thigh or a wing or something?

06:38.195 --> 06:40.459
No, that's not necessary, Coach.

06:40.697 --> 06:45.225
Listen, you know how you always said
that if any of us guys had any problems...

06:45.335 --> 06:47.633
...even personal ones,
that we should see you?

06:47.738 --> 06:49.103
That's what I'm here for.

06:49.206 --> 06:52.642
Great, because, I got a problem.

06:54.244 --> 06:59.011
Yeah? What kind of problem?
As you can see, I'm a very busy man here.

06:59.283 --> 07:01.683
Yeah, it's kind of complicated.

07:01.785 --> 07:04.219
No, those kind of problems, yeah.

07:04.488 --> 07:06.422
What is it, drugs, girls?

07:07.190 --> 07:10.057
I'd sure like to help,
but I'm really tapped out this month.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.957
The IRS is breathing down my neck...

07:12.062 --> 07:14.895
...like it's a personal vendetta
against Bobby Finstock.

07:14.998 --> 07:16.363
No, Coach...

07:17.067 --> 07:18.694
How can I put this?

07:19.836 --> 07:21.929
I'm going through changes.

07:22.673 --> 07:26.165
That. Don't worry about that.
We all go through that.

07:26.276 --> 07:29.370
Some a little bit later than others.
I'm sorry I didn't notice...

07:29.479 --> 07:32.380
...but I haven't been
around the locker room much.

07:32.482 --> 07:33.744
No...

07:34.885 --> 07:39.379
I don't think it's going to be possible
for me to play on the team anymore.

07:39.489 --> 07:40.956
Yeah.

07:41.858 --> 07:44.691
Look, Scotty,
I know what you're going through.

07:45.228 --> 07:49.289
A couple years back, a kid came to me
much the same way you are now...

07:49.399 --> 07:52.197
...saying pretty much
the same thing that you are.

07:52.302 --> 07:54.497
He wanted to drop off the team.

07:54.838 --> 07:57.932
His mother was a widow.
All crippled up and scrubbing floors.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.532
She had this pin in her hip.

08:01.144 --> 08:03.772
So he wanted to drop basketball
and get a job.

08:04.915 --> 08:06.542
These were poor people.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.414
These were hungry people
with real problems.

08:09.519 --> 08:11.714
You understand what I'm saying?

08:13.690 --> 08:15.248
What happened to the kid?

08:16.626 --> 08:20.084
I don't know. He quit.
He was a third-stringer, I didn't need him.

08:21.530 --> 08:23.089
Coach, I'm a first-stringer.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.363
And you already got
a job working for your old man.

08:26.770 --> 08:30.035
The fact of the matter is,
I should be coming to you for money.

08:31.975 --> 08:34.909
Fine. Thanks a lot, Coach.

08:35.011 --> 08:39.176
Don't mention it.
Like I said before, <i>mi casa su casa.</i>

08:41.118 --> 08:42.278
Thanks.

08:51.828 --> 08:53.955
- Scott, you going to work?
- Yeah.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.555
- Can I walk with you?
- Catch you later at the party.

08:56.666 --> 09:01.262
Bye, Tina, Trina... Tina.
I had the strangest dream last night.

09:01.370 --> 09:03.805
- It was bizarre.
- Was I in this one?

09:03.907 --> 09:07.308
Yeah, you and Pamela,
and a bunch of chickens.

09:07.410 --> 09:08.776
Boof, how the hell are you?

09:08.879 --> 09:09.846
- Say no.
- No!

09:09.946 --> 09:10.935
Great talking to you!

09:11.048 --> 09:14.245
- Chickens?
- Yeah, big, giant chickens. Like fryers.

09:15.185 --> 09:17.380
That guy was right. We do suck.

09:17.487 --> 09:19.114
No news there.

09:19.256 --> 09:22.419
71-12. I don't even know
what I'm doing out there.

09:23.427 --> 09:27.727
I'm sick of it, Boof.
I'm sick of being so average.

09:28.465 --> 09:31.525
And it's not just basketball.
It's this school.

09:31.835 --> 09:33.928
It's this town. It's everything.

09:34.037 --> 09:35.800
I like Beacontown.

09:36.406 --> 09:38.306
I'd just like my life to change.

09:38.408 --> 09:42.003
I don't want to end up
working for my dad at the hardware store.

09:42.145 --> 09:44.238
Your father's a terrific guy.

09:45.015 --> 09:46.607
Look at me.

09:48.085 --> 09:50.053
Try and be objective.

09:50.620 --> 09:53.783
Am I all right?
I mean, is there anything wrong with me?

09:55.192 --> 09:57.626
You should probably shower
after basketball.

09:57.727 --> 10:00.696
- I do.
- Then no, there's nothing wrong with you.

10:01.798 --> 10:04.790
Then why won't Pamela Wells
say two words to me?

10:05.368 --> 10:08.132
You can do a lot better than Pamela Wells.

10:08.238 --> 10:10.832
- Like who?
- Don't you have to be at work?

10:11.340 --> 10:15.368
- Did I say something wrong?
- No. See you at the party.

10:20.617 --> 10:21.641
Hey, Angela.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.912
Hi, how are you doing?
What was the score?

10:24.020 --> 10:25.453
Very funny.

10:26.490 --> 10:28.754
- What was the score?
- 71...

10:28.859 --> 10:32.386
- Don't tell me. I'll lose my count.
- We're down to our last waffle iron.

10:32.496 --> 10:34.327
You know these wrenches
are made in India?

10:34.430 --> 10:36.296
How do they expect me to compete?

10:36.399 --> 10:39.334
I'm not Sears and Roebuck. I'm not.

10:39.736 --> 10:41.533
You look a little tired today.

10:41.638 --> 10:44.402
The coach isn't giving you
steroids or anything, is he?

10:44.508 --> 10:48.740
Not likely. Maybe he should.
We lost 71-12.

10:49.546 --> 10:51.912
Beacontown hasn't won a ball game in...

10:52.015 --> 10:54.040
It must be three years.

10:55.719 --> 11:00.156
Don't take it personally, Scott.
It's all part of growing up.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.982
Yeah, I guess so.

11:03.927 --> 11:05.622
Any deliveries?

11:08.365 --> 11:11.766
Some strange-sounding guy called.
Sounded like he was in a big hurry.

11:11.868 --> 11:13.062
Today?

11:13.170 --> 11:16.037
I'm not sure what I wrote down,
but check the clipboard.

11:16.139 --> 11:18.130
That's what it's there for.

11:18.742 --> 11:19.766
It is.

11:35.926 --> 11:37.450
It's broken.

11:42.866 --> 11:44.390
Dog whistle?

12:14.764 --> 12:17.289
Hi, Mr. Thorne. How are you, sir?

12:20.670 --> 12:22.001
Thanks.

12:25.308 --> 12:27.367
Whoa. What an arm.

12:28.044 --> 12:31.707
Thanks, Mr. Thorne. Appreciate it.

12:31.982 --> 12:33.108
Go to hell.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.018
"I knew he was out there.

12:36.353 --> 12:38.218
"I didn't actually hear him...

12:38.455 --> 12:40.389
"...but I knew he was there.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.750
"I could only see a thin,
white crack of light...

12:44.027 --> 12:45.927
"...which set my bedroom apart <i>..."</i>

12:46.029 --> 12:47.326
More sensual, darling!

12:47.430 --> 12:50.456
We need to feel you!
Want to smell you! Hurt me!

12:50.567 --> 12:52.660
"...from the dense and heavy darkness.

12:52.769 --> 12:54.930
"But surely, I could feel him.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.231
"It was Nick."

12:58.775 --> 13:00.402
What was that?

13:00.944 --> 13:03.071
Sorry, sir. That was me.

13:03.513 --> 13:05.640
What do you want from me?

13:05.949 --> 13:08.679
What do people want from me?

13:09.019 --> 13:11.010
I am merely trying to rehearse.

13:11.220 --> 13:12.711
Yeah, I'm sorry.

13:13.156 --> 13:16.819
I'm sorry.
I've got the stuff that you ordered.

13:17.227 --> 13:19.525
Wait, are you from the hardware store?

13:19.896 --> 13:20.794
Yeah.

13:25.368 --> 13:29.498
Pamela, excuse me.
Are you going to the party tonight?

13:29.606 --> 13:32.769
Because, if you are,
I'd like to give you a ride.

13:32.876 --> 13:33.865
The paint...

13:33.977 --> 13:37.879
My paint, a can of cocoa,
a can of mauve, am I right?

13:38.248 --> 13:39.545
Right.

13:40.817 --> 13:45.481
- Kirk, how was my reading?
- Beautiful, darling. Very sensual.

13:45.588 --> 13:48.523
- I'm still in pain. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:48.625 --> 13:52.994
Listen, about tonight, I mean, I'm serious.
I'd like to take you.

13:53.863 --> 13:55.490
I've got a van.

13:56.333 --> 13:58.961
Hope your acting's
better than your hook shot, boy.

13:59.803 --> 14:01.202
I already have a ride.

14:01.304 --> 14:04.432
Or maybe you were just acting
like a basketball player.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.801
He just delivers hardware, Mick.

14:07.243 --> 14:10.371
Maybe he should get back to delivering it.
Come on.

14:24.127 --> 14:27.688
I said, "mauve," not turquoise!

14:29.199 --> 14:30.632
Mr. Lolley...

14:36.773 --> 14:39.537
The boss says I'm to pick up a keg of beer.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.637
- That right?
- The boss called you, right?

14:42.746 --> 14:45.146
- Can't say he did.
- Hot damn!

14:45.248 --> 14:49.309
The boss is throwing a big bash
for one of the boys down at the gravel pit.

14:50.353 --> 14:52.344
He just got paroled.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.725
I got plenty of bread.

15:04.934 --> 15:07.459
Here's a little extra for you.

15:12.108 --> 15:13.939
Got to see your ID...

15:14.878 --> 15:16.004
...sport.

15:36.766 --> 15:38.063
I don't even like beer.

15:38.168 --> 15:41.934
Never say die.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.373
Dad?

15:52.816 --> 15:56.616
What would you say if I was
thinking of quitting the basketball team?

15:56.719 --> 15:58.118
Quitting the team?

15:58.288 --> 16:00.586
- Yeah.
- That's pretty drastic, isn't it?

16:00.690 --> 16:02.555
You're not the worst player.

16:02.659 --> 16:05.560
Your mother always said
you could do anything you wanted to.

16:05.662 --> 16:07.095
Yeah, I know.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.199
I was thinking of doing something else.

16:10.333 --> 16:11.630
Like what?

16:12.502 --> 16:13.935
School play.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.935
Theater has its place, I suppose...

16:17.040 --> 16:20.009
...but what about
your commitment to the team, the school?

16:20.109 --> 16:21.235
Dad...

16:22.178 --> 16:26.137
...has anything ever happened to you
that was so weird...

16:27.350 --> 16:29.045
Maybe it's time you and I had a chat.

16:29.152 --> 16:31.552
Mr. Howard,
how's the king of the nuts and bolts?

16:31.654 --> 16:33.849
- Stiles, nice shirt.
- Thanks.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.613
Come on, we're late.

16:36.392 --> 16:38.053
Boof going with you?

16:38.160 --> 16:40.356
Yeah, I don't know how she's getting there.

16:40.530 --> 16:43.158
- Is this okay?
- Don't worry about it, I'll get it.

16:43.266 --> 16:45.734
Have a good time. Be careful.

16:49.572 --> 16:50.766
Come on!

16:51.107 --> 16:53.041
Listen, Stiles.

16:53.643 --> 16:56.203
Do you know anything
about a rash that's going around?

16:56.312 --> 16:59.440
- Why, you looking to catch something?
- I'm serious.

16:59.549 --> 17:00.777
No...

17:01.250 --> 17:03.811
...but I heard Mr. Murphy,
you know, the shop teacher?

17:05.020 --> 17:07.182
Got his dick caught in a vacuum cleaner.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.281
Forget I asked.

17:20.169 --> 17:24.127
- Stiles, you're crazy.
- No, it's not crazy. It's perfect.

17:24.607 --> 17:28.167
You just stick this in your pocket, like this.
All right?

17:28.278 --> 17:31.509
Go in there, and don't say anything except,
"Give me a keg, buddy."

17:31.614 --> 17:35.015
And you pay for it.
That way, he can't say you robbed him.

17:35.118 --> 17:38.849
You know I'd do this myself,
but the old guy already kicked me out.

17:41.324 --> 17:44.293
Give me the gun. Give me the money.

17:46.529 --> 17:49.259
I'm going to try and buy it. That's it!

17:49.365 --> 17:52.892
No, Scott!
This guy is a ball-buster and it won't work.

17:53.002 --> 17:54.993
- That's it!
- It won't work!

17:56.472 --> 17:57.530
Shit!

18:03.813 --> 18:05.371
Never say...

18:07.650 --> 18:09.015
...die.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.082
No, not that.

18:11.320 --> 18:15.758
Yeah, no, I think I'll leave it.
Thanks a lot, anyways.

18:16.593 --> 18:17.560
Bye.

18:17.660 --> 18:19.787
Do you have any more
of that brown liqueur?

18:19.896 --> 18:21.989
My sister really liked that.

18:24.133 --> 18:25.623
Yes, thank you.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.795
- Yvette, are you coming?
- Yes.

18:34.677 --> 18:35.666
Hi.

18:37.580 --> 18:38.569
Hi.

18:40.483 --> 18:42.883
I'd like a keg of beer, please.

18:44.087 --> 18:45.554
You don't say?

18:46.255 --> 18:48.246
How much is that?

18:49.058 --> 18:51.117
Do you have any ID, sonny?

18:52.160 --> 18:54.891
You little bastards just won't give up,
will you?

18:54.998 --> 18:57.193
Listen. No ID, no goddamn beer.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.167
Can't you get that through
your thick skull?

19:04.740 --> 19:08.677
Give me a keg of beer.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.221
And these.

19:20.757 --> 19:23.317
"Findin' my way"

19:26.796 --> 19:28.354
Yeah!

19:33.603 --> 19:36.037
What'd you say to that guy in the store?

19:36.139 --> 19:39.074
Just, "Give me a keg."

19:39.942 --> 19:42.172
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:43.279 --> 19:46.180
Lewis, this is it, tonight's the night.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.579
Pamela Wells is going to be there
and so am I.

19:48.685 --> 19:50.243
And so is Mick.

19:50.353 --> 19:51.980
- He won't.
- Of course he will.

19:52.088 --> 19:54.989
- Aren't they going together?
- No. They're not.

19:55.090 --> 19:56.888
Mick is 20 years old.

19:56.993 --> 20:00.087
The only reason he's still in high school
is because he did time.

20:00.196 --> 20:02.289
They're not going together.

20:02.398 --> 20:04.696
- Forget Pamela Wells.
- They're not going together.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.530
He's a total psycho.

20:06.836 --> 20:09.828
Why don't you go for Boof? She likes you.

20:09.939 --> 20:11.372
You sound like my dad.

20:11.474 --> 20:12.839
Pull over!

20:13.342 --> 20:14.639
Pull over!

20:15.610 --> 20:16.543
Trust me.

20:16.679 --> 20:19.204
- They are together.
- I'm not even listening anymore.

20:19.315 --> 20:21.783
Would you just listen?
They are locked at the hip.

20:21.884 --> 20:24.546
Lewis, once and for all,
they are not going out.

20:24.654 --> 20:25.882
- Yeah, they are.
- Not.

20:25.988 --> 20:29.287
- They are, too. You're crazy.
- Lewis. Take my wheels.

20:29.459 --> 20:32.519
- I don't even have my license yet.
- Come on, just do it.

20:32.628 --> 20:35.961
Let's just go to the party.
I don't think this is such a good idea.

20:36.065 --> 20:37.362
Surf's up.

20:38.900 --> 20:41.301
- Drive out in front of us.
- Not too close.

20:41.404 --> 20:44.635
- What are you guys going to do?
- Lewis, will you just do it?

20:46.943 --> 20:48.001
Kids.

20:49.345 --> 20:51.575
Listen, I'm going to go slow, all right?

20:51.680 --> 20:56.311
Listen, don't worry about a thing.
We got everything under control.

20:56.419 --> 21:01.322
You do your thing, and I will do mine.
Cowabunga!

22:10.960 --> 22:12.052
Wipeout!

22:13.095 --> 22:14.653
Are you all right up there?

22:14.797 --> 22:17.789
Yeah, no sweat!
But just watch those waves!

22:33.549 --> 22:34.743
Hello, everybody.

22:34.850 --> 22:37.581
Yes, I have arrived. Good to see you.

22:37.787 --> 22:40.483
You look great, and I like all of you.
Now, back off.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.217
Hi, everybody.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.355
Yeah! Nice hit, baby.

22:47.463 --> 22:50.398
- You are a cheeseball.
- That's my middle name.

22:50.533 --> 22:54.162
- You'd never catch me up there.
- You'd be the king of the urban surfers.

22:54.270 --> 22:57.398
No way, Lewis, that's fine, baby.
Give me that.

23:54.063 --> 23:55.223
Hi.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.662
You looking for someone in particular?

24:00.770 --> 24:02.135
Not you.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.937
There you go. She said two words to you.

24:13.783 --> 24:15.307
Yeah!

24:15.584 --> 24:18.576
Just like I said, yes!
No dry throats tonight.

24:18.688 --> 24:21.156
Did I come through for you,
big fella, or what?

24:21.257 --> 24:22.986
Okay, put it down over there.

24:23.092 --> 24:26.528
If we don't get through it tonight,
take it home.

24:29.865 --> 24:32.197
18! 19! 20!

24:32.300 --> 24:36.635
21! 22! 23! 24! 25!

24:36.739 --> 24:41.540
26! 27! 28! 29! 30!

24:44.313 --> 24:47.805
That's it! Time! You lose!

24:52.520 --> 24:54.318
You got a rash?

24:59.829 --> 25:02.491
Matchmaker lady, the hat! All right.

25:05.368 --> 25:07.268
Next up is...

25:07.970 --> 25:09.870
..."Help Me, Rhonda!"

25:14.810 --> 25:16.437
Okay, what do I have to do?

25:16.545 --> 25:20.072
Just read that name
on the little piece of paper we gave you.

25:20.182 --> 25:21.911
It says, "Chubby."

25:38.467 --> 25:39.866
All right, baby.

25:41.504 --> 25:45.235
You have to eat this whole bowl of Jell-O.

25:48.610 --> 25:50.909
- What do I have to do?
- Hold the Jell-O!

26:14.437 --> 26:16.997
All right, next up is...

26:20.810 --> 26:22.038
...Boof!

26:28.384 --> 26:30.909
It's Scott.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.522
- Booferino gets the Howard boy.
- I don't know if this is such a good idea.

26:42.730 --> 26:45.222
You're going to love it.
It's the grand prize, okay?

26:50.406 --> 26:54.900
Two minutes! Anything goes, baby.
And don't disappoint us.

27:11.794 --> 27:14.854
It's kind of funny that you got me.

27:15.197 --> 27:16.960
I lied. I got Malcolm.

27:18.367 --> 27:20.096
Malcolm's a good guy.

27:22.070 --> 27:24.972
You can come a little closer.
I promise I won't bite.

27:25.074 --> 27:27.269
Go! Go! Go!

27:46.829 --> 27:50.287
Now, all you have to do is take this cup,
go to Thorne's house...

27:50.399 --> 27:54.460
...say you're from the Board of Health
and want to check his blood sugar.

27:58.407 --> 28:01.274
Boof, I feel kind of weird.

28:02.344 --> 28:03.743
How do I feel?

28:27.069 --> 28:29.799
- What is this?
- Mick, you've got to see this.

28:29.905 --> 28:32.567
See what? I don't have to see anything.
Come on.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.541
Scott, you're getting a little bit rough.

28:41.016 --> 28:42.779
Your fingernails!

28:47.957 --> 28:50.050
It's awfully quiet in there.

28:53.829 --> 28:56.889
- Do you guys think they're dead?
- Yeah!

28:57.466 --> 28:59.764
There's only one way to find out!

29:09.678 --> 29:13.045
So, tell us,
what's it like coming out of the closet?

29:16.318 --> 29:18.047
It was unexpected.

29:58.694 --> 29:59.820
Scott?

30:08.704 --> 30:09.830
Scott?

31:20.109 --> 31:21.974
Jeez, Louise.

31:23.712 --> 31:24.838
Scott?

31:25.314 --> 31:27.782
- Can I come in?
- No, Dad.

31:28.217 --> 31:31.675
No, I'm doing something in here.

31:33.389 --> 31:34.617
I'll say.

31:34.890 --> 31:36.187
You may be surprised.

31:36.290 --> 31:39.692
Whatever it is, son, you can tell me.
I'll understand.

31:42.164 --> 31:45.827
No, Dad. Not this time.

31:46.969 --> 31:51.736
Scott Howard, this is your father speaking!
Now, open this door, right this minute!

31:51.840 --> 31:53.205
Ok, Dad.

31:55.377 --> 31:56.969
You asked for it.

32:15.864 --> 32:18.526
An explanation is probably long overdue.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.891
An explanation?

32:21.637 --> 32:24.333
Jesus Christ, Dad! An explanation?

32:24.440 --> 32:27.102
Look at me. Look at you.

32:27.209 --> 32:30.645
- It's not as bad as it looks.
- Wait a minute!

32:30.746 --> 32:32.680
You mean, you knew about this?

32:32.780 --> 32:35.750
You knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

32:35.850 --> 32:40.151
I was hoping I wouldn't have to.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

32:40.756 --> 32:45.090
- I was hoping it would pass you by.
- Dad, it didn't pass me by.

32:45.594 --> 32:47.994
It landed on my face!

32:48.630 --> 32:50.723
What the hell am I gonna do?

32:56.805 --> 32:59.205
We really need to talk about this!

32:59.308 --> 33:02.402
Forget it! I don't want to talk! Go away!

33:34.343 --> 33:35.901
Tough night?

33:36.512 --> 33:38.480
Yeah, you could say that.

33:39.214 --> 33:42.672
On top of everything else,
there was a full moon last night.

33:42.885 --> 33:45.353
I meant to talk to you
about that last evening...

33:45.454 --> 33:48.651
...but you were kind of upset.

33:50.759 --> 33:52.954
Here's a nice hot cup of cocoa.

33:53.362 --> 33:55.330
Looks like you can use it.

33:55.630 --> 33:57.064
That'll help.

33:58.534 --> 34:02.368
Look, Scott, being what we are...

34:02.470 --> 34:05.440
...is not without its problems,
but it's not all bad, either.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.769
Tell me about it.

34:06.875 --> 34:09.969
For one thing, you'll be able
to do things other guys aren't.

34:10.078 --> 34:14.036
Like, chase cars and bite the mailman?

34:14.516 --> 34:17.576
When you want it,
you're going to have great power.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.650
And with great power goes
a greater responsibility.

34:21.889 --> 34:24.484
Your mother and I lived with it
and so can you.

34:24.592 --> 34:26.322
And what if I can't?

34:26.562 --> 34:30.931
I can look forward to a life of
stealing babies in the middle of the night...

34:31.033 --> 34:33.024
...and killing chickens.

34:33.702 --> 34:37.831
Fearing full moons, dodging silver bullets.
Thank you, but no thanks!

34:37.940 --> 34:40.135
Don't believe the stuff in the movies.

34:40.242 --> 34:42.870
With certain obvious exceptions...

34:43.445 --> 34:46.312
...werewolves are people
just like anyone else.

34:48.317 --> 34:52.617
What I'm trying to say is,
the werewolf is a part of you...

34:52.788 --> 34:55.416
...but that doesn't change
what you have inside.

34:55.623 --> 34:57.148
I got a bad outside hook shot...

34:57.259 --> 35:02.162
...I’m allergic to eggs, I got a $6 haircut.
I have problems!

35:02.497 --> 35:04.488
I don't need this one!

35:06.602 --> 35:08.729
I've got to get to school.

35:13.575 --> 35:15.065
That went well.

35:32.995 --> 35:34.326
- Hello.
- Hi.

35:37.933 --> 35:40.493
There's something different about you.

35:40.802 --> 35:42.167
That's nice.

35:42.470 --> 35:44.405
Did you change your hair?

35:46.440 --> 35:48.739
Missed you at lunch today, Scott.

35:49.310 --> 35:53.077
Yeah. Hi, Boof. Sorry, I forgot.

35:53.515 --> 35:55.039
I have to go study my lines.

35:55.150 --> 35:58.813
Kirk, Mr. Lolley, he's so demanding.

36:00.989 --> 36:02.616
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:13.402 --> 36:15.233
How's it going, Stiles?

36:17.606 --> 36:20.700
The twins were abandoned
and surely would've died in the wild...

36:20.809 --> 36:23.607
...if they hadn't been saved by a...
By a what?

36:24.446 --> 36:25.572
A miracle?

36:26.080 --> 36:27.275
Yes, I suppose...

36:27.382 --> 36:30.681
...but what form
did this particular miracle take?

36:30.886 --> 36:32.319
Scott Howard?

36:43.230 --> 36:46.564
Very amusing, Scott, but you are correct.

36:46.735 --> 36:50.068
The infants were saved
and suckled by a wolf...

36:50.539 --> 36:52.063
...a she-wolf.

36:52.174 --> 36:53.937
<i>Wolf.</i>

36:54.543 --> 36:55.510
Wolfe!

36:57.479 --> 36:58.537
Choo.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.281
Thomas Wolfe. Don't you people ever read
what I assign you?

37:02.384 --> 37:04.079
<i>Look Homeward, Angel.</i>

37:04.286 --> 37:08.552
Scott, it's a book by Thomas Wolfe.

37:09.324 --> 37:10.518
<i>Wolf.</i>

37:11.993 --> 37:13.153
Scott.

37:15.730 --> 37:19.258
Come on. It's a lot simpler than it looks.

37:23.472 --> 37:24.461
Okay.

37:39.454 --> 37:41.012
Just try.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.589
It's wet. You can't go in.

38:15.857 --> 38:17.415
That's wet, too!

38:48.857 --> 38:50.848
Don't change.

38:51.092 --> 38:52.923
Stay calm.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.095
A bit far from your side of the building,
aren't you?

39:04.206 --> 39:08.233
No! I mean, yes, sir.
But the halls were wet.

39:09.544 --> 39:11.535
- Let me see your hands.
- Sir?

39:11.646 --> 39:14.274
Let me see your hands, now.

39:23.058 --> 39:26.653
You wouldn't happen to have
a marker on you, would you?

39:30.899 --> 39:33.459
No, sir.

39:34.069 --> 39:37.869
I've got my eyes on you.
And if you ever get out of line...

39:39.908 --> 39:42.206
I've got to go.

40:01.897 --> 40:03.262
What are you doing?

40:03.365 --> 40:06.960
Big brother always
keeps a stash out here for emergencies.

40:08.270 --> 40:10.465
Listen.

40:10.605 --> 40:13.972
I've got to talk to you about something
because it's making me nuts.

40:14.075 --> 40:18.205
I hear you, but if it's that intense,
I'll need a solid buzz to think clearly.

40:18.313 --> 40:22.113
Look, I wouldn't even...

40:22.217 --> 40:26.210
...mention it to you,
except that I've got to talk to someone.

40:26.320 --> 40:28.152
Are you going to tell me you're a fag?

40:28.256 --> 40:31.885
If you're going to tell me that,
I don't think I can handle it.

40:32.060 --> 40:34.085
No, I'm not a fag.

40:35.363 --> 40:37.456
I'm a werewolf.

40:40.402 --> 40:42.495
Where would that scumbag keep it?

40:53.480 --> 40:54.607
Scott?

40:59.654 --> 41:01.178
Stiles, it's me.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.360
What do you think?

41:14.903 --> 41:18.532
Can you do that anytime you want?

41:21.009 --> 41:23.807
Yeah, I guess so. I mean, I just did.

41:23.912 --> 41:27.245
Sometimes it happens
when I don't want it to.

41:29.784 --> 41:31.274
What can I say?

41:34.723 --> 41:36.315
You're beautiful.

41:38.293 --> 41:39.317
Nah.

41:42.330 --> 41:45.959
What can a teen wolf do?

41:46.067 --> 41:48.535
I can smell what you're looking for.

41:49.237 --> 41:50.704
The stash?

41:54.175 --> 41:56.234
I checked there.

42:08.456 --> 42:10.515
This is just between you and me, okay?

42:10.625 --> 42:12.559
Yeah, T.W.

42:16.464 --> 42:17.988
Look at you!

42:18.099 --> 42:22.502
You're going to be glad you came to me.
Yes, because with the right angles...

42:22.604 --> 42:27.064
...man, we're going to turn this
into something monstrous.

42:30.779 --> 42:32.371
Come on!

42:32.880 --> 42:34.576
Shoot it! Shoot it!

42:34.682 --> 42:36.912
No way!

42:37.052 --> 42:40.112
Don't foul me, now! Here we go!

42:43.124 --> 42:44.182
Yeah!

42:48.863 --> 42:51.764
- Hi, Scott.
- Hi.

42:51.900 --> 42:55.336
Boof came over for a little one-on-one,
and she's killing me.

42:57.305 --> 42:59.773
What? What's so funny?

43:00.040 --> 43:02.839
Nothing.
We were just chatting. Do you mind?

43:02.944 --> 43:05.139
No. Why should I mind?

43:06.347 --> 43:09.805
I've got to get going.
Would you like to walk me home?

43:11.152 --> 43:13.143
Boof, I just got here.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.450
Scott.

43:16.624 --> 43:17.522
Yeah.

43:17.625 --> 43:19.786
Thanks for the game.
Thanks for everything.

43:19.894 --> 43:23.125
- You better work on that jump shot.
- Yeah.

43:26.700 --> 43:29.568
- You coming?
- Yeah.

43:37.579 --> 43:38.443
Get in!

43:42.684 --> 43:44.652
So, you guys were chatting.

43:44.953 --> 43:47.353
Harold Howard and his famous chats.

43:48.389 --> 43:49.686
What did he say?

43:49.790 --> 43:53.955
He just mentioned that you were thinking
of quitting basketball...

43:54.062 --> 43:56.053
...to work on the school play.

43:56.197 --> 43:58.757
- Yeah.
- I can see why.

43:59.234 --> 44:01.202
She's very pretty, Scott...

44:01.603 --> 44:06.006
...but she has a boyfriend,
a very large boyfriend.

44:07.242 --> 44:09.676
It doesn't matter.
The way things are going...

44:09.777 --> 44:12.143
...it'd be better if I
stay away from everyone.

44:12.247 --> 44:13.441
Even me?

44:15.583 --> 44:17.949
I couldn't get rid of you if I tried.

44:19.787 --> 44:21.652
- What?
- Do you remember?

44:22.524 --> 44:24.856
- How old were we? 6?
- We were 5.

44:24.959 --> 44:28.190
I wanted to run away from home,
but you wouldn't let me go alone.

44:28.296 --> 44:29.593
I was afraid you'd get lost!

44:29.697 --> 44:32.257
But I didn't.
We kept walking around the block...

44:32.367 --> 44:35.131
...because our parents wouldn't let us
cross the street.

44:35.236 --> 44:37.431
I thought they'd kill us when we got home.

44:37.539 --> 44:40.508
But then when we did,
nobody knew we were gone.

44:40.608 --> 44:42.337
- Did you ever tell anybody?
- No.

44:42.443 --> 44:43.808
Me neither.

44:50.318 --> 44:51.444
Scott.

44:52.620 --> 44:56.647
If you ever need someone to talk to,
if something's bothering you...

44:56.758 --> 44:58.487
...I’ll understand.

45:00.695 --> 45:03.027
Not this time, Boof.

45:03.932 --> 45:05.661
You won't understand.

45:07.569 --> 45:10.037
- I've got to go.
- Yeah. Bye.

45:32.227 --> 45:35.628
Here's the drill. Play them man for man.

45:35.730 --> 45:39.257
- You know who you got.
- Baby, ten-hut. Nice haircut over there.

45:39.367 --> 45:41.665
Be all that you can be.
How was Grenada, man?

45:41.769 --> 45:45.603
Louie, what's going on here?
Is the President here today or something?

45:46.374 --> 45:50.242
- Good luck, Scott.
- Thanks. Thank you.

45:57.752 --> 46:00.744
Look at it this way, guys,
it'll be over in less than an hour.

46:00.855 --> 46:03.153
Any strategy against Meechum, Coach?

46:03.258 --> 46:06.625
You guys are great.
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

46:06.760 --> 46:09.161
Go on out there and give 'em hell!

46:17.505 --> 46:19.473
Okay, that's a foul. Let's go.

46:21.376 --> 46:22.673
Come on, set it up!

46:23.210 --> 46:25.202
Up to the line, boy! You can do it!

46:25.313 --> 46:29.044
All right, nothing but net, boy.
Come on, put it in.

46:39.394 --> 46:41.259
Go and get me some salt.

46:42.830 --> 46:43.888
Salt!

46:45.566 --> 46:47.466
Put the ball back to him.

46:49.070 --> 46:50.765
Let's do it, Scott.

46:52.407 --> 46:53.465
Easy.

47:00.580 --> 47:01.946
Yeah!

47:12.527 --> 47:14.154
Come on, let's go!

47:20.268 --> 47:21.496
Nice one!

49:00.334 --> 49:02.359
- All right, guys!
- All right!

49:02.470 --> 49:04.631
Let's play a little ball here!

50:23.450 --> 50:25.419
Give the guy some room!

50:28.623 --> 50:31.820
- Scott, did the coach know?
- I didn't know!

50:34.695 --> 50:37.562
- How do you feel?
- He feels like a winner!

50:45.907 --> 50:49.001
- Boof, did you know?
- Are you kidding?

50:51.946 --> 50:53.641
On the house, honey!

51:53.740 --> 51:55.072
Lewis.

52:00.615 --> 52:01.673
Mr. T.

52:01.782 --> 52:03.943
You may think you're special here...

52:04.050 --> 52:07.509
...but let me remind you
that I am still the vice principal.

52:08.623 --> 52:11.456
I'm no different than anyone else.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.428
That's nice. You look good in that.

54:08.743 --> 54:10.176
Scott Howard.

54:10.945 --> 54:13.243
Aren't you afraid
of disappointing your fans?

54:13.347 --> 54:16.282
I can't help it
if the whole town has gone wolf-crazy.

54:16.383 --> 54:18.578
I mean, this wasn't my idea.

54:19.086 --> 54:21.418
- There are some advantages.
- None.

54:21.522 --> 54:23.683
All sizes, no waiting. Check it out!

54:23.790 --> 54:26.954
Right over here. Check it out!
Scott, tip of the iceberg, baby.

54:27.060 --> 54:29.894
We are cleaning up!
Boof, I got something for you.

54:29.997 --> 54:30.986
Here you go, honey.

54:31.098 --> 54:33.362
Here we go! All sizes, no waits!

54:33.467 --> 54:35.492
- Check it out!
- Elegant.

54:37.505 --> 54:41.066
Listen to this.
Kirk wants you to be in the play.

54:42.443 --> 54:45.378
He does? Wait a minute.
Pamela, what about basketball?

54:45.479 --> 54:49.074
It won't interfere.
It's a small part, just for you.

54:50.184 --> 54:54.348
Here, Pamela, this is for you.
It's too big for me.

54:54.522 --> 54:57.457
There are some advantages, Scott.
Admit it.

54:58.125 --> 55:00.059
Catch, here it comes!

55:01.962 --> 55:04.021
What do you want? Large, medium?

55:05.199 --> 55:07.360
"You can murder my family.

55:07.635 --> 55:09.865
"You can ravish my body.

55:10.170 --> 55:14.471
"But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy...

55:14.742 --> 55:16.903
"...don't destroy my plantation."

55:22.583 --> 55:23.811
"Sergeant!

55:24.050 --> 55:25.609
"Burn the fields.

55:25.953 --> 55:29.320
"And when you're done with that,
burn the house."

55:30.190 --> 55:31.385
Yeah.

55:32.660 --> 55:36.357
Wolf...
Wolf person, whatever your name is...

55:36.463 --> 55:38.363
...that was really...

55:38.532 --> 55:40.523
- Thanks, babe. I love you.
...something.

55:44.038 --> 55:45.232
Come in.

55:47.942 --> 55:48.931
Hi.

55:49.743 --> 55:51.074
Close the door, please.

55:51.712 --> 55:52.770
Yeah.

56:01.188 --> 56:02.314
Relax.

56:03.123 --> 56:05.614
We're just one big,
happy family in the theater.

56:07.962 --> 56:09.020
Yeah.

56:13.267 --> 56:15.235
What happened to the wolf?

56:15.469 --> 56:19.803
Do you just change back and forth
whenever you feel like it?

56:20.740 --> 56:22.038
Sure.

56:22.209 --> 56:25.804
Sometimes I have to get
kind of worked up to be the wolf...

56:25.946 --> 56:28.779
...but, that's not too hard.

56:30.217 --> 56:33.482
What do you think about to get worked up?

56:35.289 --> 56:37.655
Different things.

56:42.696 --> 56:44.994
Wolves aren't supposed to be shy.

56:48.802 --> 56:50.394
Pamela...

56:51.070 --> 56:52.663
...what are you doing?

56:55.943 --> 56:58.138
You are an animal!

57:19.033 --> 57:20.625
Strike!

57:21.268 --> 57:22.735
Five in a row!

57:35.516 --> 57:36.505
Okay.

57:39.019 --> 57:41.544
Did you know he was going to be here?

57:43.690 --> 57:47.855
We had such a nice day together, Scott.
Don't spoil it.

57:52.633 --> 57:53.622
Okay.

57:53.900 --> 57:54.868
You got it.

57:55.536 --> 57:58.266
Nice, good, okay. Good form.

57:58.372 --> 57:59.532
Nice approach.

58:05.145 --> 58:06.373
Pooh.

58:07.314 --> 58:08.941
Boy, that was nice form.

58:11.518 --> 58:12.507
Okay.

58:13.587 --> 58:15.145
Address the ball.

58:15.622 --> 58:17.817
Okay, tuck in your tummy.

58:18.392 --> 58:21.293
That's good. Okay. Pamela.

58:22.496 --> 58:25.021
Here we go. You ready? Okay.

58:25.132 --> 58:28.829
That's my girl! Don't touch her again.

58:28.936 --> 58:30.699
She's my date tonight, pal.

58:31.672 --> 58:33.640
You don't scare me, freak.

58:34.975 --> 58:37.910
Underneath all that hair,
you're still a dork, Scott.

58:39.213 --> 58:40.840
I've handled your kind before.

58:40.948 --> 58:43.576
Your mama used to
steal chickens out of the backyard...

58:43.684 --> 58:46.175
...until I blew her head off
with a shotgun. Right?

58:51.625 --> 58:53.354
What's going on?

58:55.629 --> 58:57.153
French fries all over my...

59:02.202 --> 59:06.662
Does that guy, Mick, always act like that?

59:06.774 --> 59:09.902
You can hardly blame him.
He is my boyfriend.

59:10.010 --> 59:12.103
You mean, "was" your boyfriend.

59:12.212 --> 59:13.839
"Is" my boyfriend.

59:13.947 --> 59:16.507
But, what about us?

59:17.084 --> 59:18.142
What about us?

59:19.453 --> 59:21.648
Well, this afternoon...

59:22.056 --> 59:23.751
...in your dressing room.

59:23.924 --> 59:24.982
Yeah?

59:26.193 --> 59:27.251
Yeah.

59:28.028 --> 59:30.622
See, the spring dance is coming up, and I...

59:30.730 --> 59:34.690
I already told you,
I'm going to the dance with Mick.

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:20.580
- Chubaroo, nice game, guy.
- Yeah.

01:00:23.117 --> 01:00:24.448
At least we're winning.

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:27.452
You mean, "He's winning."
When do we get the ball?

01:00:27.554 --> 01:00:30.717
What good is being in the championship
if none of us get to play?

01:00:30.824 --> 01:00:33.987
It doesn't matter how you play,
it's whether you win or lose.

01:00:34.094 --> 01:00:36.358
And even that doesn't
make much difference.

01:00:36.463 --> 01:00:39.694
How about a celebration.
Chubby, ice cream sundae...

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:42.792
I'm supposed to be on a diet,
Scott, remember?

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.233
Brad, glass of milk?

01:00:47.174 --> 01:00:49.506
I don't get it, Coach.
What's their problem?

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:53.376
Let me give you a little advice.
There's three rules that I live by:

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.448
Never get less than 12 hours sleep...

01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:58.712
...never play cards with a guy
with the same name as a city...

01:00:58.819 --> 01:01:02.346
...and never go near a lady
who's got a tattoo of a dagger on her body.

01:01:02.456 --> 01:01:06.256
Now, you stick with that,
everything else is cream cheese.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.155
Great game, there, Scotty.

01:01:10.797 --> 01:01:12.264
Thanks, Coach.

01:01:23.143 --> 01:01:24.303
Stiles?

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.044
- Where the hell did you get this?
- Harry's Used Cars.

01:01:29.149 --> 01:01:31.049
We traded in the Nova. Even swap.

01:01:32.219 --> 01:01:34.483
Get out of here.
How much extra did you pay?

01:01:34.588 --> 01:01:36.215
It's an even swap.

01:01:36.557 --> 01:01:38.957
For certain considerations.

01:01:39.059 --> 01:01:40.959
- What?
- Lookie here!

01:01:43.497 --> 01:01:44.828
Surf's up?

01:01:45.465 --> 01:01:47.626
Yeah, surf is definitely up.

01:01:48.202 --> 01:01:50.193
Let's go pick up Lewis, okay?

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:52.805
What?

01:01:53.106 --> 01:01:56.473
Come on, what is it with Lewis?
He's avoiding me, right?

01:01:56.577 --> 01:01:58.169
He's scared of me.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:03.176
We've got fine new wheels,
we got good tunes...

01:02:03.283 --> 01:02:06.514
...and a total disregard for public safety.

01:02:07.654 --> 01:02:10.282
- You're right. Okay, let's go. Surf's up.
- All right.

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:11.857
Wait a minute.

01:02:12.392 --> 01:02:14.223
These waves are mine.

01:03:02.776 --> 01:03:04.744
Unbelievable! Look at him!

01:03:09.783 --> 01:03:11.250
Unbelievable!

01:03:12.319 --> 01:03:14.879
You look great up there. Are you all right?

01:03:31.505 --> 01:03:34.030
Missed you at the hardware store
the last few days.

01:03:34.474 --> 01:03:37.034
Yeah. Sorry...

01:03:37.144 --> 01:03:39.669
...I was with Stiles this afternoon.

01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:41.540
I know.

01:03:43.016 --> 01:03:44.210
You saw?

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:47.816
I saw, unless that was another werewolf...

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.321
...doing a handstand
on Stiles' wolfmobile...

01:03:50.424 --> 01:03:52.858
...and making a fool of himself.

01:03:54.428 --> 01:03:55.725
Look...

01:03:57.064 --> 01:04:00.158
I'm trying to get a grip on this. I really am.

01:04:01.635 --> 01:04:05.036
- Is Thorne still on your back?
- Yeah, Thorne...

01:04:05.505 --> 01:04:09.202
...some Neanderthal named Mick,
and the entire basketball team.

01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:11.368
You've dug your own hole with them...

01:04:11.478 --> 01:04:14.106
...but this Thorne business is my fault.

01:04:16.216 --> 01:04:18.309
What do you mean, your fault?

01:04:19.186 --> 01:04:20.881
It goes back a few years.

01:04:21.388 --> 01:04:25.222
As you know,
I loved your mother since we were kids.

01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:27.691
We always knew
we were meant for each other.

01:04:27.794 --> 01:04:31.355
But for some reason,
Rusty Thorne set his cap for her, too.

01:04:31.530 --> 01:04:34.659
And no matter what we tried,
he just wouldn't go away.

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.429
One night, things got a little physical...

01:04:37.537 --> 01:04:39.903
And you turned into the werewolf.

01:04:40.273 --> 01:04:44.403
Out of anger, Scott.
I turned into the werewolf out of anger...

01:04:45.345 --> 01:04:47.836
...right in front of his beady little eyes.

01:04:47.948 --> 01:04:50.439
- Was he scared?
- Scared?

01:04:52.052 --> 01:04:54.282
He lost control of his bodily functions.

01:04:54.988 --> 01:04:56.649
I wish I could've seen that.

01:04:57.390 --> 01:05:01.259
It wasn't a very nice thing to do,
but it worked.

01:05:01.862 --> 01:05:04.729
After that,
he never bothered your mother and me.

01:05:06.066 --> 01:05:07.431
But to this day...

01:05:08.368 --> 01:05:11.098
...I don't know who was
the most frightened that night...

01:05:11.204 --> 01:05:12.637
...old Rusty Thorne...

01:05:13.206 --> 01:05:14.332
...or me.

01:05:15.475 --> 01:05:18.205
You got to get a hold of it, son.

01:05:35.262 --> 01:05:36.422
Morning, Daisy.

01:05:36.663 --> 01:05:39.029
- Morning.
- Boof.

01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:43.598
- What's up?
- Nothing.

01:05:45.772 --> 01:05:50.300
Why does anything ever have to be up?
I just thought I'd walk to school with you.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:00.451
Got any plans for the spring dance?

01:06:00.854 --> 01:06:03.345
No. I hadn't given it much thought.

01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:07.894
I'm surprised they haven't
decided to call it Teen Wolf Ball.

01:06:11.698 --> 01:06:14.258
Will you go with me to the dance?

01:06:15.769 --> 01:06:17.498
I'll think about it.

01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:20.601
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:22.332
On one condition...

01:06:23.477 --> 01:06:25.411
...you take me to the dance.

01:06:25.545 --> 01:06:28.981
- I thought we established that.
- You, Scott Howard.

01:06:29.316 --> 01:06:30.749
Not the wolf.

01:06:32.786 --> 01:06:33.946
No.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:38.216
Look, I've got to be the wolf.
That's what everyone expects.

01:06:38.325 --> 01:06:39.952
Is that what you want?

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.891
Everybody likes the wolf.

01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:45.161
All right, almost everybody.

01:06:45.432 --> 01:06:47.992
You said it yourself. I mean, if I go...

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:50.695
...as Scott Howard,
I'm going to be average.

01:06:50.937 --> 01:06:53.735
Damn it! Why do I have to be
like everybody else?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.070
That's not a problem for you anymore...

01:06:57.744 --> 01:07:00.372
...and I guess I don't have
a date for the dance.

01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:05.778
I'm sorry. I can't.

01:07:08.488 --> 01:07:10.046
Listen...

01:07:10.724 --> 01:07:12.919
...you'll still dance with me, won't you?

01:07:13.927 --> 01:07:15.758
Even if I'm a werewolf?

01:07:17.564 --> 01:07:19.395
Yeah, I'll still dance with you.

01:07:21.434 --> 01:07:24.096
- Will you feed me grapes?
- Don't push your luck.

01:07:24.204 --> 01:07:25.501
Tickle my paws?

01:07:56.136 --> 01:07:58.866
She's right. You are an animal.

01:08:30.537 --> 01:08:32.402
There he is!

01:08:35.341 --> 01:08:36.434
My God!

01:08:39.045 --> 01:08:41.877
He looks fabulous.
You look absolutely wonderful.

01:08:41.982 --> 01:08:44.644
Guys. You shouldn't. This is great.

01:08:45.852 --> 01:08:47.251
Nice to see you.

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:49.787
Thank you. This is great.

01:08:50.055 --> 01:08:52.786
How you doing? Save me a dance?

01:08:52.926 --> 01:08:54.587
You'll have to ask my escort.

01:08:54.694 --> 01:08:57.219
Stay away from her tonight.
I'm warning you!

01:08:57.497 --> 01:09:00.523
Nice fedora. Looks good.

01:09:00.767 --> 01:09:01.734
Great.

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:03.697
Thank you. Thanks.

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:05.933
Hi. How you doing?

01:09:08.742 --> 01:09:10.334
Wolf! Wolf!

01:09:10.443 --> 01:09:12.377
You still want to dance with the wolf?

01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:15.014
Wolf! Wolf!

01:09:20.153 --> 01:09:21.916
Your public wants you.

01:09:22.921 --> 01:09:24.287
Do you mind?

01:10:58.150 --> 01:10:59.140
What?

01:10:59.252 --> 01:11:01.482
What am I going to do about you?

01:11:01.588 --> 01:11:03.579
Boof, I am what I am.

01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:08.825
All I said was:

01:11:08.962 --> 01:11:11.055
"I might want to dance with him."

01:11:11.164 --> 01:11:13.564
You can't possibly take him seriously...

01:11:13.666 --> 01:11:16.533
...not unless
you're planning on having his puppies.

01:11:23.977 --> 01:11:26.343
I want Scott for just a half hour.

01:11:26.713 --> 01:11:28.442
I really missed him.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.081
Stay away from Pamela! She's mine!

01:12:13.293 --> 01:12:17.024
Stick with your own kind, freak,
like that little tramp.

01:12:20.233 --> 01:12:21.791
Mick, watch out!

01:12:28.808 --> 01:12:30.969
What are you all laughing at?

01:12:31.177 --> 01:12:33.338
Get back here! I'm not done with you.

01:12:33.446 --> 01:12:35.880
You're just some kind of animal.

01:12:36.482 --> 01:12:37.949
Come on, freak!

01:12:38.184 --> 01:12:40.049
Get back here! Let go of me!

01:12:40.353 --> 01:12:43.083
Let go!
Get back, I'm going to rip your head off!

01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:45.555
Get back here! Come on, freak!

01:12:46.092 --> 01:12:48.026
I'm not through with you yet!

01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:52.095
Come back here, freak.
This isn't done by a long shot!

01:12:52.298 --> 01:12:54.323
Get back in here, freak!

01:12:56.603 --> 01:12:59.868
Get back here, freak,
we haven't settled this yet!

01:13:09.582 --> 01:13:10.776
Hold it.

01:13:16.689 --> 01:13:18.554
Now you've done it.

01:13:19.826 --> 01:13:22.954
You don't know how long I have waited...

01:13:24.197 --> 01:13:26.825
...to get you right where I have you.

01:13:29.002 --> 01:13:32.665
You're never going
to play basketball again.

01:13:33.506 --> 01:13:34.871
You know why?

01:13:34.974 --> 01:13:38.137
Because you're not
going to be here anymore, that's why.

01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:40.736
You're out of here, Mr. Howard.

01:13:40.847 --> 01:13:43.077
- And don't you try...
- Thorne.

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:45.483
Go on home, son.

01:13:45.985 --> 01:13:47.282
Go ahead.

01:13:47.387 --> 01:13:49.150
I'll handle this.

01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:01.795
You never learn, do you, Rusty?

01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:03.766
You stay away from me.

01:14:04.137 --> 01:14:08.631
I want you to leave my son alone.

01:14:09.142 --> 01:14:10.632
He's a good kid...

01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:13.910
...he's just having a tough time right now.

01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:15.540
Okay?

01:14:28.428 --> 01:14:30.658
I knew I could count on you, Rusty.

01:14:36.569 --> 01:14:38.503
"You can murder my family.

01:14:38.838 --> 01:14:40.829
"You can ravage my body.

01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:44.569
"But I beg you
with all that is decent and holy...

01:14:45.078 --> 01:14:47.273
"...don't destroy my plantation!"

01:14:51.184 --> 01:14:52.412
"Sergeant!

01:14:52.585 --> 01:14:53.779
"Burn the fields <i>..."</i>

01:14:53.886 --> 01:14:55.547
Hold it.

01:14:55.655 --> 01:14:59.785
<i>- "...</i> burn down the house."
- Hold it right there, babe.

01:14:59.892 --> 01:15:01.018
Listen...

01:15:02.662 --> 01:15:06.154
...this is a full dress rehearsal.

01:15:06.265 --> 01:15:09.996
We need to see the wolf, so wolf out.
Wolf up, wolf it, whatever you do.

01:15:10.103 --> 01:15:11.468
<i>Pronto, amigo.</i>

01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:15.473
Mr. Lolley, I've been doing some thinking...

01:15:15.575 --> 01:15:18.874
...and I decided
that I'd rather play the part as me.

01:15:19.979 --> 01:15:22.607
Play it as myself.

01:15:22.715 --> 01:15:25.479
That wouldn't be theater, would it?

01:15:25.585 --> 01:15:28.145
See, no one wants to see you.

01:15:30.523 --> 01:15:31.888
Like I said...

01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.626
...I’d rather play it like this.

01:15:34.827 --> 01:15:36.419
Okay. I see.

01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:39.663
How am I going to put this to you?

01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:41.427
Look at it this way:

01:15:41.534 --> 01:15:45.595
No wolf, no part.

01:15:46.205 --> 01:15:47.832
What do you think?

01:15:58.384 --> 01:16:00.147
Wow. Bummer.

01:16:06.359 --> 01:16:09.726
Look at it this way.
At least I'll have my Friday nights free.

01:16:09.829 --> 01:16:13.925
Even if you won't be the wolf anymore,
do you have to quit the basketball team?

01:16:14.033 --> 01:16:17.867
Are you kidding?
You've seen me play basketball. I suck.

01:16:19.439 --> 01:16:21.669
They want the wolf. I can't give it to them.

01:16:21.774 --> 01:16:26.108
Wait just a minute. What's going on here?
What are you guys talking about?

01:16:26.813 --> 01:16:28.678
We're talking about the wolf.

01:16:29.048 --> 01:16:32.040
I can't do it anymore.
You saw what happened.

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:34.551
- What are you, crazy?
- I think maybe I am.

01:16:34.654 --> 01:16:38.090
You've got the championship game
in less than four hours.

01:16:38.190 --> 01:16:40.125
You've got everyone depending on you.

01:16:40.226 --> 01:16:42.490
What are you going to do?
Let down your team?

01:16:42.595 --> 01:16:45.826
Your school? This whole town?
What about me?

01:16:45.932 --> 01:16:49.095
I've got a very large investment
going on over here.

01:16:50.036 --> 01:16:51.469
Do it for me.

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:55.498
I got to go, man.

01:16:55.942 --> 01:16:57.534
Help me out.

01:16:58.210 --> 01:16:59.906
Do the right thing.

01:17:01.914 --> 01:17:03.779
That's all I want to do.

01:17:04.317 --> 01:17:06.182
That's all I want to do.

01:17:41.888 --> 01:17:44.186
Time! Chubby!

01:17:44.290 --> 01:17:45.814
Chubby, get time!

01:17:46.325 --> 01:17:47.622
Come here.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.953
Did you see that?

01:17:52.064 --> 01:17:53.258
Come on!

01:17:59.138 --> 01:18:01.129
That's a purple heart, kid.

01:18:05.344 --> 01:18:08.438
Smart basketball, Brad.
Taking a charge like that.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.555
Man.

01:18:52.358 --> 01:18:54.087
Where's the wolf?

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.693
Not today, Coach. No wolf.

01:18:57.797 --> 01:19:01.096
Good idea. Wait till the second half.
Build up their confidence.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.067
- Look, Coach.
- Wolf! Wolf!

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:06.866
No wolf. Not now, not ever.

01:19:07.006 --> 01:19:10.908
I want to play, but I got to be myself.

01:19:11.744 --> 01:19:14.611
Okay, but we're going to get
our brains beat in, you know.

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.915
You sure you won't change your mind?

01:19:23.022 --> 01:19:26.651
- I don't want to go back out there.
- This is all your fault, Howard.

01:19:26.859 --> 01:19:28.690
I think we can take these guys.

01:19:28.794 --> 01:19:31.160
That's terrific.
Now, when do we see the wolf?

01:19:31.264 --> 01:19:33.164
No, I mean it.

01:19:33.799 --> 01:19:35.357
I think we can win this.

01:19:35.935 --> 01:19:37.994
Look, this is the championship.

01:19:38.638 --> 01:19:41.368
Now, it doesn't matter how we got here,
we're here.

01:19:41.474 --> 01:19:43.806
We're going to have to win it ourselves.

01:19:43.909 --> 01:19:45.843
You don't need the wolf.

01:19:52.418 --> 01:19:54.511
Harold, your boy let us down!

01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:59.055
You're dead.

01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:08.959
Shoot!

01:20:09.302 --> 01:20:10.735
Shoot it.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:15.007
Shoot it!

01:20:16.475 --> 01:20:18.306
Shoot it, fat boy.

01:20:22.848 --> 01:20:23.815
Yeah!

01:22:40.352 --> 01:22:42.445
How much more of this
can you take, freak?

01:22:42.555 --> 01:22:44.455
As much as you can dish out, Mick.

01:23:45.317 --> 01:23:46.682
What's so funny, dork?

01:23:48.254 --> 01:23:52.190
That's four fouls.
One more and you're out of there.

01:25:21.647 --> 01:25:22.944
Right!

01:25:26.085 --> 01:25:27.518
Come on. Make your move.

01:25:42.167 --> 01:25:44.362
Come on, fat boy. Come on, try it.

01:26:12.665 --> 01:26:14.155
You got to get back.

01:26:14.266 --> 01:26:16.496
Get back! You got two shots.

01:26:16.602 --> 01:26:18.627
Get back! Off the court.

01:28:43.348 --> 01:28:44.815
Let's blow out of here.

01:28:44.917 --> 01:28:46.179
Drop dead.
