00:08.758 --> 00:11.487
I love that pussy

00:11.527 --> 00:14.090
The wettest pussy, hell, yeah

00:14.130 --> 00:17.293
I'm drinking up
your Booty Sweat and busting a nut

00:22.739 --> 00:27.227
Booty Sweat and Bust-A-Nut bars
available at concessions now.

00:30.346 --> 00:34.476
In 2013, when the Earth's rotation
came to a halt?

00:34.584 --> 00:38.214
The President has declared
all of North America a disaster area.

00:38.254 --> 00:41.017
I call on my fellow Americans
to come together?

00:41.057 --> 00:45.611
the world called on the one man
who could make a difference

00:49.132 --> 00:53.422
When it happened again,
the world called on him once more.

00:54.570 --> 01:00.440
And no one saw it coming
three more times!

01:02.979 --> 01:04.640
Now,

01:04.747 --> 01:08.683
the one man who made a difference
five times before,

01:11.120 --> 01:15.489
is about to make a difference again.

01:16.225 --> 01:20.321
Only this time, it's different.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.815
Who left the fridge open?

01:25.234 --> 01:27.168
Tugg Speedman.

01:27.270 --> 01:32.037
Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown.

01:32.141 --> 01:33.904
Here we go again.

01:35.445 --> 01:36.434
Again.

01:45.054 --> 01:47.921
Will there be anything else?

01:48.024 --> 01:51.221
Yes, my dear man. More beans.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.190
Granny!

01:57.133 --> 01:58.293
Please!

01:58.401 --> 02:03.361
This summer,
America's favorite obese family is back.

02:06.242 --> 02:07.800
Gross!

02:07.910 --> 02:10.473
–You're just mad 'cause I'm skinny.
–Am not!

02:10.513 --> 02:12.003
Jeff Portnoy.

02:12.682 --> 02:14.149
Jeff Portnoy.

02:14.750 --> 02:16.240
Jeff Portnoy.

02:16.352 --> 02:22.450
And Jeff Portnoy are
The Fatties: Fart Two.

02:22.558 --> 02:24.389
In some countries,

02:25.595 --> 02:27.290
it's considered a compliment.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.527
Letting loose this summer.

02:39.809 --> 02:45.543
In a time where to be different
was to be condemned,

02:59.295 --> 03:03.994
and to be condemned was to die,

03:08.237 --> 03:12.298
one man chose to question his God.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.127
From Fox Searchlight,

03:26.822 --> 03:30.122
five-time Academy Award winner
Kirk Lazarus

03:31.160 --> 03:35.494
and MTV Movie Award
Best Kiss winner Tobey Maguire.

03:41.871 --> 03:46.689
Winner of the Beijing Film Festival's
coveted Crying Monkey Award,

03:47.610 --> 03:49.601
Satan's Alley.

03:54.116 --> 03:56.756
I've been a bad, bad boy, Father.

04:32.154 --> 04:34.952
In the winter of 1969,

04:35.057 --> 04:37.153
an elite force of the U.S. army

04:37.193 --> 04:42.062
was sent on a top-secret assignment
in southeast Vietnam.

04:42.164 --> 04:44.994
The objective,
rescue Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback

04:45.034 --> 04:48.094
from a heavily guarded
NVA Prison Camp.

04:48.204 --> 04:51.702
The mission was considered
to be near suicide.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.907
Of the 10 men sent, four returned.

04:56.012 --> 04:59.508
Of those four, three wrote books
about what happened.

04:59.548 --> 05:02.517
Of those three, two were published.

05:02.618 --> 05:06.782
Of those two, just one got a movie deal.

05:08.291 --> 05:13.524
This is the story of the men
who attempted to make that movie.

05:24.340 --> 05:27.003
<i>Whiskey Fire Old Snake
requests an LZ prep</i>

05:27.043 --> 05:30.277
<i>at Alpha-Delta-two-four-eight-niner,

05:34.917 --> 05:40.065
Floyd, this is lead. Right echelon
approach from RP to LZ, acknowledge.

05:40.323 --> 05:43.491
Floyd, Wall-Eye airborne.
Welcome aboard.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.723
All right, lead's going in.
Give her some cover.

05:47.763 --> 05:51.195
Delivery on five.
I repeat, delivery on five.

05:56.672 --> 05:59.268
This is Zero-Three.
I'm on your six, don't worry.

05:59.308 --> 06:03.070
Chalk-Three's taking fire.
Guns right, guns right.

06:13.989 --> 06:16.116
Lay that shit down!

06:16.225 --> 06:17.522
Come on!

06:19.362 --> 06:21.660
Come on, you damn dirty heathens!

06:23.599 --> 06:25.861
Fats! Run your motherfucking ass
over there,

06:25.901 --> 06:27.263
hold these men off, now!

06:27.303 --> 06:28.998
We're fixing to lift off!

06:29.105 --> 06:31.801
Put some pep in your step, Dick!
Jelly-ass bitch!

06:31.841 --> 06:35.537
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye,
this is Boomer One-Seven in the Zee!

06:35.978 --> 06:39.379
I need fast movers
on my Yankee Smoke, copy?

06:39.482 --> 06:41.911
<i>Boomer, this is Wall-Eye.
I got two-Alpha-four</i>

06:41.951 --> 06:44.246
<i>?i>snake and nape on the ready>
–Oh, Jesus! Holy shit!</i>

06:44.286 --> 06:45.446
Holy shit!

06:45.554 --> 06:47.416
Get on that horn
and get some firepower, boy!

06:47.456 --> 06:48.423
Jesus Christ!

06:48.524 --> 06:49.685
Listen, you cherry fuck,

06:49.725 --> 06:53.289
you call in that snake and nape
and get us some boom-boom now!

06:53.329 --> 06:55.858
I'd do it myself
but I'm kind of goddamn busy!

06:55.898 --> 06:57.326
<i>I need an answer, Boomer!</i>

06:57.366 --> 06:59.061
Wall-Eye, Wall-Eye!

06:59.502 --> 07:00.867
I copy!

07:01.103 --> 07:03.401
We got beaucoup zips in the zee.

07:03.506 --> 07:04.996
Rock and roll!

07:05.374 --> 07:06.864
What the fuck?

07:18.821 --> 07:21.255
That's for Brooklyn, motherfucker!

07:21.357 --> 07:23.291
I think I can put it back in!

07:23.392 --> 07:25.221
We got to get back to the bird.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.422
Lukemeyer's got popped!

07:26.462 --> 07:29.525
This is the last Christmas
I spend with Victor Charlie up my ass!

07:29.565 --> 07:32.261
Want some? Get some!

07:32.701 --> 07:35.534
Hey, yo, Fats! I ain't seen Four Leaf!

07:35.638 --> 07:36.098
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

07:36.138 --> 07:38.934
Don't count him out! That bastard's
got luck tattooed to his ass!

07:38.974 --> 07:42.076
Motown, get your Detroit jukebox
Jheri curl ass

07:42.077 --> 07:44.373
in this chickenshit chop-chop! ASAFP!

07:44.413 --> 07:46.308
Four Leaf is still
outside the perimeter, Sarge!

07:46.348 --> 07:49.478
<i>Miss me with that cracker chump jive!
We di di mau! We di di mau!</i>

07:49.518 --> 07:51.213
Come on, Sarge. Stop jiving.
Four Leaf is there.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.948
Dead meat, soldier!

07:53.155 --> 07:55.055
Or do you want to be a hero?

07:55.157 --> 07:57.119
That's just how Brooks
got his Jew ass killed, man.

07:57.159 --> 07:59.922
And Meatball's dago ass
bought the six-by-three farm.

07:59.962 --> 08:04.978
Now get your ass up in the Huey, before
I stomp a trench in your hiney hole!

08:05.267 --> 08:06.729
Come on, get down, get down!

08:06.769 --> 08:09.079
What am I looking at? What is this?

08:09.705 --> 08:13.664
Come on, let's get, let's go!
Come on, elevator up, up!

08:13.776 --> 08:16.301
Sarge. It's Four Leaf.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.649
No!

08:31.994 --> 08:33.644
You get out of that hole!

08:45.574 --> 08:47.439
You make it home, now.

08:54.884 --> 08:56.146
Survive!

09:10.933 --> 09:13.028
I hope y'all like hamburger meat.

09:13.068 --> 09:15.197
'Cause that's exactly what
I'm gonna be bringing back

09:15.237 --> 09:17.333
and serving up in this whirly bird.

09:17.373 --> 09:19.864
Cover me, you limp dick fuckups!

09:25.514 --> 09:28.745
Peek-a-boo! I see you!

09:30.786 --> 09:32.515
Hold on, Four Leaf!

09:35.157 --> 09:36.488
Oh, shit!

09:44.300 --> 09:45.790
Watch my right!

09:48.571 --> 09:50.539
Fuck you, Charlie!

09:55.511 --> 09:57.775
Come on, Leaf, let's boogie!

10:04.954 --> 10:06.615
No!

10:06.722 --> 10:07.814
No!

10:10.993 --> 10:13.086
–Fats!
–Holy fuck!

10:14.363 --> 10:16.923
Take us over to those men! Shit!

10:21.403 --> 10:24.372
Look at you, man.
Playing with grenades.

10:27.876 --> 10:29.138
I'm cold, Linc.

10:31.180 --> 10:33.011
I can't feel my legs.

10:34.149 --> 10:36.140
Ain't nothing but a thang.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.053
Hey, Linc.

10:42.024 --> 10:43.389
What, man?

10:44.627 --> 10:46.720
Why does man

10:46.829 --> 10:49.764
got to pick up sticks
against another man?

10:51.967 --> 10:54.265
Instead of using them sticks to

10:55.638 --> 10:57.230
prop a man up?

10:57.339 --> 10:58.966
I'll never know.

11:00.275 --> 11:02.505
Hold my hands,

11:02.611 --> 11:04.442
'cause I got something to

11:04.546 --> 11:06.411
I got something to say.

11:07.816 --> 11:09.477
Oh, boy.

11:13.622 --> 11:16.318
–You holding 'em?
–I got 'em tight.

11:19.061 --> 11:21.041
When we get back to the world,

11:21.196 --> 11:25.427
we gonna put together that three-piece
combo band we talked about?

11:25.467 --> 11:28.459
–Me on stand-up bass.
–Johnny on drums.

11:29.938 --> 11:32.065
And me tickling the ivories.

11:34.176 --> 11:37.441
I ain't never been worth a nothing
in this life,

11:37.546 --> 11:40.310
but I want you to know something.

11:41.383 --> 11:42.680
What, man?

11:44.586 --> 11:45.883
You are my

11:47.389 --> 11:49.084
You are my brother.

12:02.071 --> 12:07.099
You are my brother.
You are my?You are my

12:07.276 --> 12:08.903
I am your brother.

12:12.414 --> 12:14.143
I'm sorry. Could we cut?

12:14.249 --> 12:15.811
–What's he saying?
–Damien, can we cut?

12:15.851 --> 12:17.579
–No. No, no, no, no, no
–All right, you know what?

12:17.619 --> 12:20.683
We got the jets coming in,
big explosion, two minutes.

12:20.723 --> 12:21.815
Still rolling.

12:21.924 --> 12:23.619
You know what? No, not still rolling.
Can we cut?

12:23.659 --> 12:25.387
–We're cutting.
–No, we're not. Get out!

12:25.427 --> 12:27.456
Hey, what's going on?
For real, my butt is hurting!

12:27.496 --> 12:29.692
This harness is riding up my crack!

12:29.732 --> 12:32.261
–Damien, are we cutting?
–No! No! Still rolling!

12:32.301 --> 12:34.479
Mr Cockburn! Are we cutting, sir?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.699
No! No. I'm not cutting!
We're still rolling!

12:37.806 --> 12:38.934
Damien, what's the dealy, dude?

12:38.974 --> 12:40.836
Are we gonna blow
this tree line or what?

12:40.876 --> 12:42.504
Tuk Tuk and Kim
got the blue balls here.

12:42.544 --> 12:43.839
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

12:43.879 --> 12:46.175
–Play it through. Still rolling!
–Dieter, can he hear me?

12:46.215 --> 12:48.844
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

12:48.884 --> 12:51.313
I need some dudes up here
who speak American, God damn it!

12:51.353 --> 12:52.881
He's making
a fucking sweater back here.

12:52.921 --> 12:55.317
I'm trying to put Tiger Balm
on this jungle's nuts.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.585
Everyone, please shut up.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.854
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

12:58.894 --> 13:00.293
And go!

13:00.395 --> 13:02.903
Let's do it. You feel it?
You feel me?

13:03.699 --> 13:06.065
–You are my
–I am your brother.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.400
We've seen it all, man.

13:09.138 --> 13:10.199
I'm sorry, Damien?

13:10.239 --> 13:11.559
Are you seeing that?

13:11.640 --> 13:15.666
The little froggy on the boom mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

13:15.944 --> 13:17.639
Donny! What's up, man?

13:18.313 --> 13:19.374
It's been there the whole show.

13:19.414 --> 13:20.509
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

13:20.549 --> 13:21.610
I'm staring at a frog, I'm trying to feel

13:21.650 --> 13:24.279
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

13:24.319 --> 13:26.081
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

13:26.121 --> 13:28.283
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

13:28.323 --> 13:30.919
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.325
What the fuck is going on here?

13:33.428 --> 13:35.672
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

13:35.697 --> 13:38.293
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.461
–No countdown?
–No countdown.

13:39.501 --> 13:40.763
–Okay.
–Can we just do it off of “Action?

13:40.803 --> 13:42.361
Just?In your own time.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.333
–Good
–I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

13:44.373 --> 13:46.068
–All right, dude.
–And action!

13:46.108 --> 13:49.104
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

13:49.144 --> 13:51.578
Erika, get me a VitaminWater!

13:51.680 --> 13:53.208
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

13:53.248 --> 13:57.713
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

13:57.753 --> 13:59.715
–No, it's everyone cry
–We cutting or we crying?

13:59.755 --> 14:01.150
–No, no, no, we're crying!
–Just call it, man!

14:01.190 --> 14:03.385
–Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
–Thanks!

14:03.425 --> 14:05.220
–Everybody cry
–You know what?

14:05.260 --> 14:07.289
–You see how agitated he is now?
–I know.

14:07.329 --> 14:10.125
–Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
–Okay. Still rolling!

14:10.165 --> 14:12.895
<i>This is Falcon One. We have the ridge
in sight, approximately two miles out.</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:15.264
Dieter, these jets
are about to crest this ridge line.

14:15.304 --> 14:17.299
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

14:17.339 --> 14:19.715
I need to know if we're ready to go.

14:21.143 --> 14:23.441
–You're my?You're my
–I am your

14:23.545 --> 14:27.075
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

14:27.115 --> 14:28.139
Yeah?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.179
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that?Four Leaf?

14:30.219 --> 14:32.614
Were you crying
when your hands blew up?

14:32.654 --> 14:34.349
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what

14:34.389 --> 14:36.018
So now we in re-writes, right?

14:36.058 --> 14:37.252
–Where you going?
–Let's re-write it!

14:37.292 --> 14:39.521
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

14:39.561 --> 14:41.590
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

14:41.630 --> 14:45.260
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

14:45.300 --> 14:46.962
–Now it's time to flip the script!
–Kirk

14:47.002 --> 14:49.331
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

14:49.371 --> 14:51.400
You're tangling me,
you're fucking tangling me.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.701
You're tangling me, God damn it!

14:52.741 --> 14:55.637
–Kirk, no!
–Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

14:55.677 --> 14:57.906
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

14:57.946 --> 15:00.843
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

15:00.883 --> 15:03.478
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

15:03.518 --> 15:05.113
Of course we're getting it
in a fucking wide.

15:05.153 --> 15:06.248
What, do you think
I'm a dick or something?

15:06.288 --> 15:07.880
Get that fucking food

15:07.990 --> 15:09.423
Here they come!

15:10.525 --> 15:12.967
–The planes are inbound!
–Shit! Shit!

15:13.028 --> 15:17.931
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

15:18.033 --> 15:21.002
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

15:21.103 --> 15:23.162
Let's go freaking Tet here!

15:23.272 --> 15:25.263
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

15:27.376 --> 15:28.968
That's my shit!

15:34.516 --> 15:37.451
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

15:45.327 --> 15:46.555
–Sweet.
–Oh, mama!

15:49.364 --> 15:51.628
<i>Bungle in the jungle.</i>

15:51.733 --> 15:54.897
<i>More bad news from the Vietnamese set
of Tropic Thunder,</i>

15:54.937 --> 15:58.668
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

15:58.774 --> 16:00.802
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

16:00.842 --> 16:03.572
<i>Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul

16:06.815 --> 16:09.745
<i>just five days into shooting.
The reason?</i>

16:09.785 --> 16:12.781
Fingers are pointed at rookie director
Damien Cockburn,

16:12.821 --> 16:15.984

can't control a star-studded cast,

16:16.024 --> 16:20.789
<i>including flatulent star of the popular
Fatties franchise, Jeff Portnoy.</i>

16:20.829 --> 16:23.425
<i>Let me tell you something.
A lot of people are disrespecting me.</i>

16:23.465 --> 16:27.262
<i>They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,</i>

16:27.302 --> 16:30.396

<i>Fresh from his most recent arrest

16:34.843 --> 16:37.272
<i>Portnoy was almost uninsurable.</i>

16:37.312 --> 16:41.710
<i>Also in the mix is Booty Sweat-hocking

16:41.750 --> 16:44.313
<i>I'm so excited, you know what I'm
saying, about doing Tropic Thunder.</i>

16:44.353 --> 16:46.581
<i>Hey, drink Booty Sweat, baby.
Drink Booty Sweat.</i>

16:46.621 --> 16:48.350
<i>But the real heavyweight on the set</i>

16:48.390 --> 16:49.284

<i>is famous for his total immersion

16:58.734 --> 17:00.095
<i>Well, being an actor is no different</i>

17:00.135 --> 17:02.397
<i>than being a rugby player
or a construction worker,</i>

17:02.437 --> 17:03.632
<i>save for the fact that my tools</i>

17:03.672 --> 17:05.801

<i>Trying to hold his own onscreen

<i>Recently, Speedman opened up to Tyra.</i>

<i>You have no real family.</i>

17:30.866 --> 17:35.303
<i>You're on the wrong side of 40.
You're childless and alone.</i>

<i>Somebody close to you said,</i>

<i>Somebody said they were close to me?</i>

17:45.147 --> 17:46.341
<i>It's been a tough year for Tugg.</i>

<i>The disappointing buddy comedy
Chitlir & the Dude</i>

17:49.251 --> 17:53.982

<i>the story of a mentally impaired

18:13.375 --> 18:18.540
<i>You make me happy.</i>

18:20.082 --> 18:24.519

Rum-Tum-Tuggernauts, it's the Pecker.
You got time for your agent?

18:34.896 --> 18:36.158
–Rick?
–Hey, buddy,

18:36.264 --> 18:37.893
guess who I'm staring at right now.

18:37.933 --> 18:39.661
<i>?i>What>
–I'm looking at your ugly mug</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:42.064
<i>on the back cover
of Vanity Fair magazine,</i>

18:42.104 --> 18:44.599
holding a cute, cuddly panda
from Cutesville.

18:44.639 --> 18:47.233
It is insane, bro. You are a rock star.

18:47.342 --> 18:49.982
Hey, did you get the gift basket I sent?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.069
From Rick.

18:51.179 --> 18:53.341
Yeah. Yeah. It's cool, man. Thanks.

18:53.381 --> 18:56.011
<i>All right,
that is a real satellite phone, bro.</i>

18:56.051 --> 18:57.643
Do not re-gift.

18:57.752 --> 19:00.315
<i>Hey. You see
that Access Hollywood piece?</i>

19:00.355 --> 19:03.351
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

19:03.391 --> 19:07.889
I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

19:07.929 --> 19:09.396
But right now,

19:09.498 --> 19:11.126
<i>you're like that kid on the playground,
you know,</i>

19:11.166 --> 19:14.196
the one who has lice that none
of the other kids want to play with?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.298
–What do you mean?
–I mean we gotta shave your head

19:16.338 --> 19:18.867
and get you back
on the monkey bars, right?

19:18.907 --> 19:20.238
What?

19:20.342 --> 19:22.207
How did the crying scene go?

19:22.310 --> 19:24.139
Horrible. Lazarus started crying.

19:24.179 --> 19:27.409
<i>Then he starts drooling and dribbling,
and it wasn't even in the script?/i></i>

19:27.449 --> 19:28.571
Stop right there!

19:28.650 --> 19:30.445
<i>You gotta buck up here, Tuggboat.</i>

19:30.485 --> 19:33.248
Who cares how much more talented
he may be than you?

19:33.288 --> 19:36.655
If he cries, you cry harder, man.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.987
Didn't your dog have, like, leukemia
or something

19:39.027 --> 19:40.455
<i>when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.</i>

19:40.495 --> 19:44.261
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

19:44.366 --> 19:45.628
Good gosh.

19:45.734 --> 19:47.629
<i>?i>What>
–The TiVo, they hook it up?</i>

19:47.669 --> 19:49.998
<i>?i>No. The guy didn't come>
–What?</i>

19:50.038 --> 19:52.632
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

19:52.741 --> 19:54.703
They have digital cable, but,
I mean, it's okay.

19:54.743 --> 19:57.038
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

19:57.078 --> 19:59.205
<i>It is not okay, Tugg!</i>

19:59.314 --> 20:02.511
And you don't need to explain to me
why you need TiVo

20:02.551 --> 20:06.487
or clean water, clean sheets,
food, shelter.

20:06.588 --> 20:09.751
<i>I mean, I fought for
that in your contract.</i>

20:09.791 --> 20:11.920
How's the adoption thing coming,
buddy?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.985
Not too great.

20:17.232 --> 20:19.928
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

20:21.603 --> 20:23.965
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.836
I'm stuck with mine.

20:27.742 --> 20:30.338
Tell you what, get back to work,
genius soldier.

20:30.378 --> 20:33.308
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

20:33.348 --> 20:35.177
<i>Work on those tears, my man.</i>

20:35.217 --> 20:36.309
All right. Yeah.

20:36.418 --> 20:37.976
Say it for me one time.

20:38.086 --> 20:42.352
–You make me happy.
–Make me happy.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.920
<i>?i>I love you, buddy>
–All right, bye.</i>

20:44.960 --> 20:47.022
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

20:47.062 --> 20:48.790
I mean, are we in a crisis?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.425
He's the head of the studio.

20:50.465 --> 20:52.894
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

20:52.934 --> 20:54.095
He just wants a little face-time.

20:54.135 --> 20:56.798
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So

20:56.838 --> 20:59.301
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

20:59.341 --> 21:03.744
“Crisis,?“explosion,
“not rolling,?“fired.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.231
These are just words.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.373
Yeah! Yeah!

21:07.482 --> 21:10.845
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into Judi Dench.

21:10.885 --> 21:12.080
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.649
<i>Look, he may be able to see me,
but I can't see him.</i>

21:14.689 --> 21:19.217
<i>–Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
?i>Get your ass out of my?/i></i>

21:19.327 --> 21:20.822
<i>?i>Your feet were on my desk>
–Can he see us?</i>

21:20.862 --> 21:22.257
I don't know why we don't have

21:22.297 --> 21:24.526
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

21:24.566 --> 21:27.128
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

21:27.168 --> 21:28.630
<i>–Hello, Les!
?i>Okay></i>

21:28.670 --> 21:30.799
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

21:30.839 --> 21:34.536
<i>I see you. I see you. I see you.</i>

21:34.643 --> 21:38.141
<i>Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien Cockburn?</i>

21:38.780 --> 21:40.304
That's me, sir.

21:40.415 --> 21:44.012
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

21:44.052 --> 21:48.011
<i>And who here is the key grip?
You? You.</i>

21:50.025 --> 21:53.853
<i>Hit that director in the face,
really fucking hard.</i>

22:00.368 --> 22:01.699
Sorry, man.

22:08.209 --> 22:11.110
<i>This is your fault, you limey fuck!</i>

22:11.212 --> 22:13.141
<i>You shit the money-bed, my friend.</i>

22:13.181 --> 22:15.706
–What?
–God damn it, Damien!

22:15.817 --> 22:18.980
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

22:19.020 --> 22:20.181
<i>–What?
?i>Fuck the jungle></i>

22:20.221 --> 22:21.552
Exactly!

22:22.257 --> 22:23.724
Come on, man.

22:24.459 --> 22:27.189
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

22:27.295 --> 22:29.357
but I am dealing
with a bunch of primadonnas!

22:29.397 --> 22:32.889
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

22:33.001 --> 22:35.463
<i>You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,</i>

22:35.503 --> 22:38.867
<i>you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.</i>

22:38.907 --> 22:41.102
–You spank that ass, Les.
–What?

22:41.209 --> 22:44.975
Spanking a child
turns him into a little snot.

22:45.847 --> 22:48.748
Fear makes him a man.

22:49.784 --> 22:54.380
I know a place
where a man's worth is measured

22:54.489 --> 22:58.289
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

22:58.393 --> 23:01.123
The real deep shit.

23:01.229 --> 23:02.691
You wanna make this movie right?

23:02.731 --> 23:03.892
You wanna make this movie right?

23:03.932 --> 23:07.424
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

23:09.003 --> 23:10.868
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

23:10.972 --> 23:12.872
Les, that's Four Leaf.

23:12.974 --> 23:16.273
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

23:18.480 --> 23:22.610
<i>You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.</i>

23:22.650 --> 23:25.884
<i>Now shut the fuck up
and let me do my job!</i>

23:26.488 --> 23:28.016
<i>?i>Look, Cockburn>
–Yes.</i>

23:28.056 --> 23:32.153
<i>From now on, my fist
is gonna be so far up your shithole</i>

23:32.193 --> 23:33.621
<i>that every time you have a thought,</i>

23:33.661 --> 23:36.758
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.</i>

23:36.798 --> 23:40.395
<i>Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.</i>

23:40.435 --> 23:41.557
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

23:59.287 --> 24:01.482
One week down, two weeks behind,

24:01.589 --> 24:05.453
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

24:05.493 --> 24:06.892
Let's party!

24:07.829 --> 24:09.791
Man, you better get your shit straight,

24:09.831 --> 24:13.528
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

24:13.568 --> 24:14.596
–You feel that?
–Yeah.

24:14.636 --> 24:17.408
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.871
–Sandusky. Good.
–Hey, Mr Cockburn.

24:19.974 --> 24:21.903
We need to have a cast meeting
right now.

24:21.943 --> 24:23.304
–Right now? Awesome.
–Yes.

24:23.344 --> 24:24.606
You actually care, don't you?

24:24.646 --> 24:27.308
Yeah, it's a huge deal for me,
are you kidding?

24:27.348 --> 24:29.377
I've spent the past two years of my life

24:29.417 --> 24:33.181
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

24:33.221 --> 24:34.449
I know, you're the only one
who auditioned,

24:34.489 --> 24:36.117
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

24:36.157 --> 24:37.818
Hey, hey, Alpa.

24:38.526 --> 24:41.055
I'm the director. He's
I need to speak to my actor.

24:41.095 --> 24:42.390
All right, hold up. Chino?

24:42.430 --> 24:44.542
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

24:45.133 --> 24:46.694
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

24:46.734 --> 24:47.829
No, it's about the film.

24:47.869 --> 24:50.198
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

24:50.238 --> 24:52.365
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

24:52.474 --> 24:55.932
–Who are you?
–That's awesome, man.

24:58.213 --> 25:02.946
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

25:03.051 --> 25:04.712
Oh, right, right. I like you.

25:04.752 --> 25:06.781
Man, it's a real honor to be here

25:06.821 --> 25:08.183
I can tell it's gonna be
a good experience.

25:08.223 --> 25:09.417
I'm really having a good time.

25:09.457 --> 25:11.152
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

25:11.192 --> 25:15.356
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

25:15.830 --> 25:18.230
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

25:19.334 --> 25:21.165
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

25:21.302 --> 25:22.730
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

25:22.770 --> 25:24.966
I'm gonna have V.C. Soldiers
in the video

25:25.006 --> 25:26.367
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

25:26.407 --> 25:30.961
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

25:31.012 --> 25:32.740
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to

25:32.780 --> 25:35.877
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

25:35.917 --> 25:38.359
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

25:39.754 --> 25:40.914
Alpa!

25:41.022 --> 25:42.517
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

25:42.557 --> 25:43.585
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

25:43.625 --> 25:47.189
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

25:49.230 --> 25:51.626
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>

25:51.666 --> 25:54.533
<i>we see we're kind of the same.</i>

25:55.436 --> 25:58.963
<i>When we put aside our differences,
we see</i>

26:00.642 --> 26:02.622
<i>we're kind of the same.</i>

26:03.278 --> 26:05.075
<i>Let's be friends.</i>

26:05.380 --> 26:08.416
<i>I know we can do great things together.</i>

26:10.118 --> 26:14.078
<i>That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,</i>

26:14.656 --> 26:16.834
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

26:16.891 --> 26:18.686
<i>I think it pertains to the journey?/i></i>

26:18.726 --> 26:20.706
<i>Simple Jack sucked ass!</i>

26:21.129 --> 26:23.591
<i>All right, who said that? It's not funny.</i>

26:23.631 --> 26:26.469
<i>Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?</i>

26:32.707 --> 26:35.403
When the herd loses its way,

26:35.510 --> 26:39.947
the shepherd must kill
the bull that leads them astray.

26:41.783 --> 26:45.048
–Four Leaf?
–Come on over. It's okay.

26:46.721 --> 26:48.211
–Sit down.
–Yes.

26:49.624 --> 26:54.721
–So, you don't like the hotel?
–Beds give me nightmares.

26:59.767 --> 27:04.966
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

27:05.073 --> 27:09.407
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.548
What?

27:17.785 --> 27:19.377
You're a riddle

27:20.888 --> 27:23.823
with no cheese to maze through.

27:25.727 --> 27:26.754
Don't you get it?

27:26.794 --> 27:30.592
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

27:30.632 --> 27:34.568
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

27:34.669 --> 27:38.105
and you are not going to fail me.

27:38.206 --> 27:41.869
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

27:41.909 --> 27:45.743
You must put those boys in the shit.

27:45.847 --> 27:47.497
What? I don't understand.

27:47.515 --> 27:50.780
–You wanna make your movie or not?
–Yes, I do.

27:50.885 --> 27:54.449
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

27:54.489 --> 27:58.186
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

27:58.226 --> 28:01.559
Then you give me
and that pyromaniac Cody

28:01.663 --> 28:06.532
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

28:06.634 --> 28:09.068
Then we take those boys up there,

28:09.170 --> 28:12.333
me and Cody,
we could light up that fucking jungle,

28:12.373 --> 28:15.370
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

28:15.410 --> 28:17.472
and screaming for their mammies.

28:17.512 --> 28:21.274
They'd be begging for a body bag
if it means a ride home.

28:23.818 --> 28:25.342
I could do it.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.617
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

28:29.657 --> 28:33.054
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

28:33.094 --> 28:34.255
Put them in the real shit.

28:34.295 --> 28:35.556
–Real shit.
–With real fear in their eyes!

28:35.596 --> 28:38.656
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

28:38.766 --> 28:40.859
–Yes! Yes!
–Yes! Yes!

28:40.968 --> 28:43.014
Take them off the fucking grid!

29:00.188 --> 29:02.952
You are no longer actors in a movie!

29:04.058 --> 29:06.788
You are five men in a helicopter!

29:08.563 --> 29:10.326
With three other men!

29:15.970 --> 29:17.565
How long are we gonna be gone,
anyways?

29:17.605 --> 29:21.666
'Cause I left most of my vitamins
back at the hotel.

29:21.776 --> 29:25.142
–Save your breath, maggots!
–That's right, maggots!

29:36.424 --> 29:37.686
M&M?

29:39.594 --> 29:40.891
M&M?

30:00.681 --> 30:02.777
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

30:02.817 --> 30:04.612
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

30:04.652 --> 30:07.882
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

30:07.922 --> 30:10.220
Get out, you wriggly worms!

30:10.324 --> 30:12.792
–It's up too high!
–Move, move, move!

30:16.264 --> 30:17.993
See you in hell!

30:29.510 --> 30:33.708
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

30:34.982 --> 30:37.712
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

30:39.187 --> 30:41.482
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

30:41.522 --> 30:44.958
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

30:45.960 --> 30:49.590
Anybody else care to give away
our position to Charlie?

30:49.664 --> 30:51.427
Cell phones!

30:51.532 --> 30:52.999
What the hell, Damien?

30:53.100 --> 30:56.864
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

30:56.904 --> 31:00.305
Gentlemen, I've got good news
and bad news.

31:00.408 --> 31:03.972
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

31:04.045 --> 31:06.343
And the good news.

31:06.447 --> 31:09.410
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

31:09.450 --> 31:13.216
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

31:13.321 --> 31:14.882
and liberate the POW camp,

31:14.922 --> 31:18.288
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

31:18.292 --> 31:20.154
at which point you will rescue him,

31:20.194 --> 31:23.561
at which point
we will chopper you home!

31:24.765 --> 31:25.857
Damn.

31:25.967 --> 31:27.829
Four Leaf,
since you're the staff sergeant,

31:27.869 --> 31:30.331
there's the map, this is the scene list.

31:30.371 --> 31:32.498
Think you can handle it?

31:32.607 --> 31:36.805
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

31:38.279 --> 31:41.976
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

31:42.016 --> 31:45.611
so that every glorious moment
is captured on film.

31:46.888 --> 31:50.051
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

31:50.157 --> 31:52.753
If it looks real,
chances are it probably is.

31:52.793 --> 31:54.385
You wanted to be actors.

31:54.495 --> 31:57.158
You wanted to occupy
the skin of another human being.

31:57.198 --> 32:00.261
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

32:00.301 --> 32:04.067
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

32:05.106 --> 32:09.871
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

32:09.911 --> 32:14.507
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

32:14.615 --> 32:19.052
The chopper is God,
and I am Jesus Christ, his son.

32:19.153 --> 32:21.849
You are my chosen disciples.

32:21.956 --> 32:25.052
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

32:25.092 --> 32:28.118
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

32:28.229 --> 32:32.928
Now, let's go and make
the greatest war movie ever!

32:33.034 --> 32:35.366
–Yeah!
–All right!

32:54.121 --> 32:55.179
Yeah!

33:00.628 --> 33:01.686
Yeah!

33:14.241 --> 33:16.141
Not bad, Cockburn!

33:17.979 --> 33:19.173
Not bad.

33:20.881 --> 33:22.473
Wherever you are!

33:24.485 --> 33:27.851
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

33:29.357 --> 33:31.257
Here we go.

33:31.359 --> 33:33.384
Must be an old French mine.

33:33.494 --> 33:38.378
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

33:39.033 --> 33:42.491
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

33:42.603 --> 33:44.699
That's what all that
playing God stuff was about.

33:44.739 --> 33:47.368
He's trying to get us to act good,
save the movie.

33:47.408 --> 33:50.510
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

33:54.448 --> 33:57.286
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

34:03.357 --> 34:06.320
No offense, Kirk,
I know you're the big fancy actor here,

34:06.360 --> 34:10.324
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

34:10.364 --> 34:11.816
And I think I can spot

34:13.868 --> 34:15.463
a prop head when I see one.

34:15.503 --> 34:16.993
Oh, Jesus.

34:18.205 --> 34:21.697
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

34:24.912 --> 34:28.040
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

34:28.149 --> 34:29.275
Oh, God.

34:29.917 --> 34:33.114
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

34:33.154 --> 34:34.804
Oldest trick in the book.

34:36.357 --> 34:37.677
He getting down now.

34:37.758 --> 34:39.123
Oh, my God!

34:41.929 --> 34:43.988
Whoa, look at me!

34:44.098 --> 34:45.626
You're going to get the shots,

34:45.666 --> 34:48.729
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

34:48.769 --> 34:50.896
I'm from London. I direct plays.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.031
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

35:04.051 --> 35:05.746
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

35:15.396 --> 35:17.858
So, we gotta
light these boys up today, huh?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.340
Blow some sense into these young men.

35:21.068 --> 35:24.031
Hey, I don't want to come off
as weird or anything,

35:24.071 --> 35:28.007
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

35:29.376 --> 35:33.666
<i>Tropic Thunder.
Kind of like my Catcher in the Rye.</i>

35:34.115 --> 35:36.410
Yeah, I've never been in the military,
per se,

35:36.450 --> 35:39.684
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

35:40.688 --> 35:43.592
<i>Driving Miss Daisy, first studio gig.</i>

35:43.691 --> 35:44.749
Yeah.

35:45.259 --> 35:48.122
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

35:48.162 --> 35:50.142
I don't know what it's called.

35:50.965 --> 35:55.698
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a mars life.

35:58.839 --> 35:59.897
Okay.

36:00.474 --> 36:01.769
Damien, we're go for explosion.

36:01.809 --> 36:04.672
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

36:04.712 --> 36:06.758
Damien, we're go for explosion.

36:07.581 --> 36:08.676
<i>Do you copy?</i>

36:08.716 --> 36:11.645
<i>I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.</i>

36:11.685 --> 36:15.314
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

36:15.422 --> 36:18.986
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

36:19.860 --> 36:20.952
Here. Okay.

36:21.061 --> 36:24.361
“Scene 12, exterior,
jungle clearing, day, ambush.

36:28.802 --> 36:30.798
”Four Leaf notices
movement in the brush.

36:30.838 --> 36:33.934
”A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.534
Somewhere a mine explodes.
And you.

–No, that's your line.

–Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

36:49.356 --> 36:51.449
–Okay.
–Action. Go, come on.

37:00.467 --> 37:03.371
I got a bad feeling
on this one there, Fats.

37:04.672 --> 37:08.104
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

37:08.175 --> 37:10.070
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

37:10.110 --> 37:11.805
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

37:11.845 --> 37:14.608
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

37:14.648 --> 37:17.611
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

37:17.651 --> 37:20.885
He die, he probably die
a coochless motherfucker.

37:20.988 --> 37:22.387
Zip it, Motown.

37:22.489 --> 37:24.118
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

37:24.158 --> 37:27.194
You got a lot of days of fucking
ahead of you.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.921
Man, I'm thirsty.

37:31.031 --> 37:35.991
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

37:49.683 --> 37:53.775
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

37:53.988 --> 37:55.751
–You sure?
–Yeah.

37:55.856 --> 37:57.653
–Yeah?
–For certain, man.

37:57.758 --> 38:00.134
Then why are you still in character?

38:01.228 --> 38:03.670
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

38:04.331 --> 38:05.389
You don't know.

38:05.499 --> 38:09.261
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.434
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

38:13.474 --> 38:15.203
Get down, fool!

38:16.910 --> 38:20.210
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

38:21.215 --> 38:24.878
–This feels pretty real!
–Exactly! Let's use it.

38:35.496 --> 38:36.656
Yeah!

Yeah!

38:41.902 --> 38:43.164

like a motherfucker down there.

38:50.778 --> 38:52.940
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

38:52.980 --> 38:55.092
–What do you think?
–Juice them.

38:56.884 --> 38:59.375
Fuck you, Charlie!

Big-ass titties!

39:21.208 --> 39:22.505
Yeah!

39:22.609 --> 39:24.873
–What do we do now?
–Yeah.

39:24.978 --> 39:26.573
North. Man said to head north.

39:26.613 --> 39:30.010
–Did you see me shooting?
–That's how we do. Good work, baby.

39:30.050 --> 39:31.108
I believed it.

39:31.218 --> 39:32.406
D'ang Kwook River.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.481
I'm betting
he's got more of these battles

39:34.521 --> 39:37.318
and Viet Congs
rigged for us along the way.

39:37.358 --> 39:41.124
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

39:41.795 --> 39:43.558
Real, baby, I'm real.

39:44.631 --> 39:47.429
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

39:48.569 --> 39:51.595
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

39:51.705 --> 39:53.536
Don't dawdle now!

40:17.664 --> 40:22.284
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

40:24.571 --> 40:27.935
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

40:27.975 --> 40:31.869
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

40:38.419 --> 40:41.388
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.185
–What are you doing, Jeff?
–Fucking?Nothing, man!

40:45.225 --> 40:48.622
–I'm eating jellybeans.
–Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please

40:48.662 --> 40:51.434
No, you can't have
any fucking jellybeans.

40:51.498 --> 40:52.590
They're mine.

40:52.699 --> 40:53.927
You think
you're the only one who gets sick

40:53.967 --> 40:55.729
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

40:55.769 --> 40:57.221
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

41:17.090 --> 41:19.853
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

41:19.893 --> 41:24.091
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

41:24.131 --> 41:26.031
It's gonna be tough,

41:26.133 --> 41:29.895
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

41:30.704 --> 41:32.499
<i>Just wish I had
a director like this on Jack.</i>

41:32.539 --> 41:36.203
<i>On Jack. What? Jack?
What you talking about?</i>

41:36.243 --> 41:38.289
<i>?i>Simple Jack>
–Oh, yeah.</i>

41:39.713 --> 41:43.010
<i>Simple Jack, yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?</i>

41:43.050 --> 41:45.379
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

41:45.419 --> 41:47.819
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

41:47.921 --> 41:50.891
Yeah, it was an intense experience,
you know.

41:51.525 --> 41:53.618
I just did the work.

41:53.727 --> 41:58.347
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

41:58.832 --> 42:01.061
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

42:01.101 --> 42:02.930
Then again,
I always found mere observation

42:02.970 --> 42:05.332
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

42:05.372 --> 42:08.502
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

42:08.542 --> 42:12.940
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

42:12.980 --> 42:15.108
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

42:15.148 --> 42:17.945
<i>You know, there were times
when I was doing Jack</i>

42:17.985 --> 42:20.453
that I actually felt retarded,

42:20.554 --> 42:21.982
–like really retarded.
–Oh, yeah.

42:22.022 --> 42:24.284
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

42:24.324 --> 42:26.186
–I rode the bus retarded.
–Damn.

42:26.226 --> 42:29.523
In a weird way,
I had to sort of just free myself up

42:29.563 --> 42:32.593
to believe that it was okay
to be stupid or dumb.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.191
–To be a moron.
–Yeah.

42:34.301 --> 42:37.073
–To be moronical.
–Exactly, to be a moron.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.502
–An imbecile.
–Yeah.

42:38.605 --> 42:41.535
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

42:41.575 --> 42:42.803
When I was playing the character.

42:42.843 --> 42:45.506
–When you was the character.
–Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

42:45.546 --> 42:47.741
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

42:47.848 --> 42:49.176
Trying to come back from that.

42:49.216 --> 42:53.374
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

42:53.453 --> 42:56.422
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

42:56.523 --> 42:58.318
and by the end of the whole thing,
I was like,

42:58.358 --> 43:02.956
“Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?

43:02.996 --> 43:05.055
–It's just like?Right?
–Yeah.

43:05.165 --> 43:07.995
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

43:08.035 --> 43:09.900
Yeah.

43:10.003 --> 43:12.366
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

43:12.406 --> 43:13.767
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

43:13.807 --> 43:16.737
so you can't afford to play retarded,
being a smart actor.

43:16.777 --> 43:19.339
Playing a guy who ain't smart
but thinks he is,

43:19.379 --> 43:21.006
–that's tricky.
–Tricky.

43:21.114 --> 43:24.711
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

43:24.751 --> 43:26.776
–Yeah.
–You an artist.

43:26.887 --> 43:28.749
–That's what we do, right? Yeah.
–Yeah.

43:28.789 --> 43:30.117
Hats off for going there,

43:30.157 --> 43:33.721
especially knowing how
the Academy is about that shit.

43:36.597 --> 43:40.124
–About what?
–You're serious? You don't know?

43:42.336 --> 43:45.042
Everybody knows
you never go full retard.

43:45.906 --> 43:48.084
–What do you mean?
–Check it out.

43:48.141 --> 43:52.306
<i>Dustin Hoffman, Rain Man, looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.</i>

43:52.346 --> 43:56.504
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

43:57.317 --> 43:59.246
<i>Then you got Tom Hanks,
Forrest Gump.</i>

43:59.286 --> 44:01.648
Slow, yes, retarded, maybe,
braces on his legs.

44:01.688 --> 44:04.651
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

44:04.691 --> 44:05.819
That ain't retarded.

44:05.859 --> 44:10.083
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

44:11.732 --> 44:13.723
You went full retard, man.

44:15.268 --> 44:16.654
Never go full retard.

44:17.638 --> 44:21.268
<i>You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I Am Sam.</i>

44:21.308 --> 44:24.674
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

44:34.454 --> 44:37.651
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

44:38.325 --> 44:41.021
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

44:41.128 --> 44:42.456
No, that's impossible, man.

44:42.496 --> 44:45.459
I rigged the whole tree line,
and this is here.

44:45.499 --> 44:47.094
–He must have missed his mark.
–Missed his mark?

44:47.134 --> 44:48.454
Yeah, this isn't me.

44:48.468 --> 44:51.331
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

44:51.371 --> 44:54.134
–You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
–We're in a world of hurt!

44:54.174 --> 44:56.436
–You're in trouble.
–This isn't just on me!

44:56.476 --> 44:58.772
–We're in a?We're together on this.
–Bullshit.

44:58.812 --> 45:00.340
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

45:00.380 --> 45:02.109
What happened to,
“No man left behind,?okay?

45:02.149 --> 45:04.478
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

45:04.518 --> 45:07.314
–I don't wanna hear it.
–Let me just be real with you, all right?

45:07.354 --> 45:10.717
<i>I almost blinded Jamie Lee Curtis
on Freaky Friday, okay?</i>

45:10.757 --> 45:12.152
This shit will fucking ruin me!

45:12.192 --> 45:14.154
–Just get off me! You're pathetic.
–No, I'm not.

45:14.194 --> 45:16.662
–Get off me!
–You are not going back!

45:20.033 --> 45:22.343
–What the fuck?
–Now wait a minute.

45:32.345 --> 45:35.108
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

45:35.148 --> 45:38.111
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

45:38.151 --> 45:39.179
This thing's too heavy.

45:39.219 --> 45:40.714
I want the rubber one
that the prop guy gave me.

45:40.754 --> 45:43.018
Where's the fucking prop guy?

45:47.994 --> 45:50.588
How's it going with that map, chief?

45:50.697 --> 45:53.291
–Can I have a look at it?
–I got it.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.028
Yeah, Damien gave it to me,
remember?

45:55.068 --> 45:56.630
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.297
–Yeah.
–Okay.

45:58.405 --> 46:00.930
–I got it.
–You got it upside down.

46:01.074 --> 46:02.041
Thank you.

46:02.175 --> 46:03.804
Letters go one way
and the numbers another.

46:03.844 --> 46:05.472
Dude, I'm trying to
I got your back, man.

46:05.512 --> 46:07.340
–Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
–You are?

46:07.380 --> 46:09.245
Is your character dyslexic?

46:09.349 --> 46:11.144
–No, my character's not dyslexic.
–So you a can'tographer.

46:11.184 --> 46:13.098
I'm tired, I want to go home.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.716
<i>Why, so you can get back and make
Fatties: Fart 20, or some shit?</i>

46:15.756 --> 46:18.752
<i>It's Fatties: Fart Two, there's no?Hey,
you wish you had a>Fattie> franchise.</i>

46:18.792 --> 46:20.087
<i>–What?
–It's Fatties: Fart Two.</i>

46:20.127 --> 46:21.421
<i>–Yeah, you do.
–I don't want no Fatties franchise,</i>

46:21.461 --> 46:23.924
–I got a diamond toilet.
–Your stupid-ass commercials.

46:23.964 --> 46:25.492
You're all fucked up, man,
you look tired.

46:25.532 --> 46:26.727
You look like you bumped your head
or something,

46:26.767 --> 46:28.662
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

46:28.702 --> 46:30.797
–Yeah, why don't you get on point?
–I'm on point right here.

46:30.837 --> 46:31.932
my farts
are fucking more beautiful than

46:31.972 --> 46:34.532
You still got that shit upside down.

46:35.142 --> 46:36.603
The numbers help, man, the numbers

46:36.643 --> 46:38.939
The letters go across the top
and then the numbers.

46:38.979 --> 46:40.607
–Want the map?
–Yeah, I want the fucking map.

46:40.647 --> 46:42.142
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

46:42.182 --> 46:45.412
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

46:45.452 --> 46:47.818
All right. That's enough.

46:49.289 --> 46:53.249
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

46:53.627 --> 46:56.118
So take a chow break. Chow break!

46:57.931 --> 46:59.489
But stay alert.

47:00.066 --> 47:03.696
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

47:08.642 --> 47:11.638
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

47:11.678 --> 47:13.106
“Lost in the goddamn jungle.

47:13.146 --> 47:14.466
Captain Simple Jack.

47:15.115 --> 47:15.877
Fuck you.

47:25.025 --> 47:26.583
I fucking hate movies.

47:28.929 --> 47:32.625
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

47:41.608 --> 47:44.372
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

47:44.477 --> 47:49.141
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

47:49.249 --> 47:53.143
–Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
–You go to hell! There he is.

47:55.956 --> 47:58.891
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

47:59.860 --> 48:04.018
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

48:04.264 --> 48:07.432
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

48:08.702 --> 48:10.997
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

48:11.037 --> 48:12.664
Bait, I need bait.

48:13.807 --> 48:17.504
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

48:17.611 --> 48:18.839
Yeah, I think so.

48:18.945 --> 48:21.708
I know Speedman
got everyone convinced we out here

48:21.748 --> 48:25.612
<i>making Planet of the Apes on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.</i>

48:25.652 --> 48:28.886
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

48:28.922 --> 48:30.684
You wanna get shot
by a real motherfucker?

48:30.724 --> 48:33.887
–Keep looking ahead, man.
–No, of course not.

48:34.294 --> 48:36.455
Trying to get home, man.

48:36.563 --> 48:38.291
Got a big job coming up next year.

48:38.331 --> 48:39.764
–Oh, yeah?
–Yeah.

48:39.866 --> 48:42.462
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

48:42.502 --> 48:43.594
–Oh, wow!
–Yeah.

48:43.703 --> 48:46.266
–That's a classy picture.
–Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

48:46.306 --> 48:47.773
Slap a beard on you.

48:47.874 --> 48:49.970
–What's your fucking name?
–Really? It's Kevin.

48:50.010 --> 48:52.001
–Kevin Sandusky.
–Yeah.

48:52.679 --> 48:56.375
If I can put that map in your hands,
can I count on you?

48:56.650 --> 49:00.177
–Well, yeah, I guess you can.
–Dynamite. I'm out.

49:03.857 --> 49:06.353
That smelled just like bologna
for some reason.

49:06.393 --> 49:09.589
Is anyone gonna fucking help me
get this fucking thing?

49:09.629 --> 49:12.189
Why are they even out in the daytime?

49:14.401 --> 49:19.285
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

49:25.078 --> 49:28.844
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

49:31.051 --> 49:32.846
He's way out on a limb
with this character,

49:32.886 --> 49:35.196
and I think he's getting cold feet.

49:36.022 --> 49:38.885
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

49:38.925 --> 49:40.552
and rehearsal.

49:41.594 --> 49:44.168
–Can I count on you, Kyle.
–It's Kevin.

49:44.230 --> 49:45.288
Good.

49:46.866 --> 49:49.770
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

49:49.836 --> 49:51.997
–I'll handle the map.
–Okay.

49:52.105 --> 49:55.402
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

49:55.442 --> 49:59.205
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

49:59.245 --> 50:03.443
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

50:03.550 --> 50:07.179
–Yeah, that's wicked.
–Good.

50:13.093 --> 50:15.403
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

50:16.363 --> 50:17.591
You O.D'ed!

50:19.165 --> 50:20.496
Hold up now, Jeff.

50:22.902 --> 50:24.301
Fucking hell!

50:25.939 --> 50:28.999
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

50:29.109 --> 50:31.577
I don't have any more jellybeans.

50:38.184 --> 50:39.981
You land there!

50:54.901 --> 50:57.301
Wow. Look at these ruins.

50:59.472 --> 51:03.909
–Where the hell are we?
–D'ang Kwook River.

51:04.010 --> 51:06.439
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

51:06.479 --> 51:08.742
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

51:08.782 --> 51:13.879
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

51:13.987 --> 51:16.483
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

51:16.523 --> 51:18.718
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

51:18.758 --> 51:20.420
Why is everybody
all obsessed with the map?

51:20.460 --> 51:22.555
'Cause we're tired
of being your trail donkeys!

51:22.595 --> 51:24.995
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

51:25.098 --> 51:28.966
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

51:29.069 --> 51:31.264
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

51:31.304 --> 51:33.086
I don't believe you people.

51:34.607 --> 51:36.587
What do you mean “you people?

51:38.978 --> 51:41.572
What do you mean, “you people?

51:41.681 --> 51:43.672
I think what Tugg means is

51:43.783 --> 51:45.211
No, look at his eyes, man.

51:45.251 --> 51:48.048
you people, you actors. You people
–Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

51:48.088 --> 51:49.682
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

51:49.722 --> 51:51.690
–Hell, no!
–Silence!

51:52.725 --> 51:55.387
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

51:56.896 --> 52:00.093
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

52:00.934 --> 52:02.492
–“Viet Cong?
–What?

52:03.002 --> 52:06.099
It's “Viet Cong.?There's no “S.
It's already plural.

52:06.139 --> 52:07.987
You wouldn't say “Chineses.

52:09.109 --> 52:11.604
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

52:11.644 --> 52:14.442
If the machine breaks down,
we break down.

52:14.547 --> 52:17.143
<i>Hey, man, you know how in Rambo I,
he was big but a little puffy</i>

52:17.183 --> 52:18.845
<i>and then Rambo II,
he got all shredded up?</i>

52:18.885 --> 52:21.815
–Yeah.
–That's kind of how you look right now.

52:21.855 --> 52:23.483
<i>–Yeah?
–Not Rambo I but II.</i>

52:23.523 --> 52:25.318
–Really?
–Yeah, when he was cut up.

52:25.358 --> 52:27.787
I'm not that?I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know

52:27.827 --> 52:30.590
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

52:30.630 --> 52:32.192
–Thanks.
–What's the secret, dude?

52:32.232 --> 52:33.660
–It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
–Really?

52:33.700 --> 52:36.763
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just?It's tough.

52:36.803 --> 52:38.364
–You look good.
–Any tips?

52:38.404 --> 52:40.120
–What?
–Any tips, you got?

52:40.206 --> 52:41.401
There's, like, the pineapple

52:41.441 --> 52:43.803
–Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
–Hey!

52:43.843 --> 52:45.435
–Hey!
–All right, now!

52:45.545 --> 52:48.041
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

52:48.081 --> 52:50.040
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

52:50.125 --> 52:52.633
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

52:53.895 --> 52:55.223
We're going the wrong way!

52:55.263 --> 52:56.425
–Damn!
–Son of a bitch.

52:56.465 --> 53:00.925
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

53:01.036 --> 53:03.937
and instead we did this.

53:04.039 --> 53:07.668
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

53:07.776 --> 53:11.010
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

53:11.246 --> 53:12.645
This is not cool!

53:15.350 --> 53:16.476
Maybe.

53:17.919 --> 53:19.409
This is insane!

53:20.689 --> 53:23.527
Are you really going
to abandon this movie?

53:23.825 --> 53:26.020
We're supposed to be a unit!

53:26.128 --> 53:27.652
Suck my unit!

53:28.530 --> 53:30.327
All right, fine.

53:30.432 --> 53:35.335
–I'll finish it by myself.
–You go be all you can be, man.

53:35.437 --> 53:37.499
Tugg, you have no idea
where you're going!

53:37.539 --> 53:39.336
Yes, I do!

53:39.441 --> 53:43.969
I'm going to, “Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

53:44.079 --> 53:48.610
Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle.

53:48.650 --> 53:50.584
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

54:04.166 --> 54:07.158
Come on, men. Let's get home.

54:45.340 --> 54:50.004
Hello, Mr Mantis. You're beautiful.

54:52.280 --> 54:54.276
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

54:54.316 --> 54:56.111
where Hollywood
was split into schisms,

54:56.151 --> 54:59.614
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

54:59.654 --> 55:00.815
People thought it would come down to

55:00.855 --> 55:03.185
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

55:03.225 --> 55:07.053
What it came down to was
a combination of gamers and porn.

55:07.128 --> 55:08.924
Now, whichever format porno backs

55:08.964 --> 55:12.798
is usually the one
that becomes the most successful.

55:12.901 --> 55:15.964
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

55:16.004 --> 55:18.248
You talking to me this whole time?

55:18.473 --> 55:19.834
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

55:19.874 --> 55:21.341
Jesus Christ, man!

55:39.761 --> 55:41.820
Booty Sweat.

55:47.869 --> 55:49.268
Oh, God!

55:51.506 --> 55:56.068
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

55:56.177 --> 55:58.372
You want my flak jacket?

55:58.480 --> 56:02.410
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

56:02.450 --> 56:05.347
Keep the volume down on that bitching,
Flatch Adams.

56:05.387 --> 56:07.349
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

56:07.389 --> 56:09.417
–How we doing? We making good time?
–We're making good time,

56:09.457 --> 56:12.654
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

56:12.694 --> 56:15.257
All right, fellas,
we're gonna make camp, rest up!

56:15.297 --> 56:17.659
–Oh, God.
–Y'all might be in for a treat.

56:17.699 --> 56:19.160
You know,
back before the war broked out,

56:19.200 --> 56:21.930
I was a saucier in San Antone.

56:22.037 --> 56:24.733
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

56:24.773 --> 56:29.073
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

56:29.177 --> 56:33.533
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

56:34.549 --> 56:35.811
Hell, yeah!

56:35.917 --> 56:40.115
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

56:40.221 --> 56:45.454
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

56:45.560 --> 56:50.429
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

56:54.669 --> 56:57.069
I get excited about my foods, man.

58:22.690 --> 58:25.124
Die!

58:39.040 --> 58:41.133
No!

58:47.682 --> 58:51.982
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

58:52.086 --> 58:54.486
I have no idea.

58:54.589 --> 58:57.149
I've never been outside the States.

58:57.258 --> 58:59.487
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

58:59.527 --> 59:01.589
Did you make this
whole goddamn thing up?

59:01.629 --> 59:03.057
Dude, were you
even in the fucking service?

59:03.097 --> 59:05.759
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

59:05.867 --> 59:07.829
–Coast Guard.
–Sanitation Department.

59:07.869 --> 59:10.575
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

59:10.672 --> 59:14.469
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of A.

59:14.509 --> 59:17.238
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

59:17.278 --> 59:19.407
Yeah, you're the Milli Vanilli
of patriots, okay?

59:19.447 --> 59:21.209
You lied
about fighting the Vietnam War.

59:21.249 --> 59:24.579
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

59:24.619 --> 59:26.114
God, and to think I believed in you!

59:26.154 --> 59:28.583
–I don't wanna be next to you.
–Writers lie all the time.

59:28.623 --> 59:30.999
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

59:52.068 --> 59:53.899
<i>?i>Rick>
–Tugg.</i>

59:54.003 --> 59:56.062
I killed one, Rick.

59:57.206 --> 59:59.606
The thing I love most in the world.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:01.622
Vivica, get off the line now!

1:00:03.846 --> 1:00:06.308
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

1:00:06.348 --> 1:00:08.477
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

1:00:08.517 --> 1:00:09.745
Get your hands on some bleach,

1:00:09.785 --> 1:00:12.214
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

1:00:12.254 --> 1:00:13.744
No, a panda.

1:00:13.856 --> 1:00:15.619
<i>I killed a panda.</i>

1:00:15.724 --> 1:00:17.521
Amanda? Come on, dude.

1:00:17.626 --> 1:00:19.722
I mean,
that's probably not even her real name.

1:00:19.762 --> 1:00:21.423
No, a panda!

1:00:21.530 --> 1:00:22.895
A panda?

1:00:22.998 --> 1:00:25.592
A sweet, cuddly,

1:00:25.701 --> 1:00:27.635
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

1:00:27.770 --> 1:00:30.766
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

1:00:30.806 --> 1:00:32.034
It's beautiful here.

1:00:32.074 --> 1:00:33.564
<i>You on the set?</i>

1:00:33.676 --> 1:00:34.938
I am the set.

1:00:35.044 --> 1:00:38.074
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

1:00:38.114 --> 1:00:39.342
Screw TiVo.

1:00:39.448 --> 1:00:41.916
I'm way beyond TiVo.

1:00:42.017 --> 1:00:44.180
Last I checked,
they hadn't hooked it up, though.

1:00:44.220 --> 1:00:47.519
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

1:00:47.623 --> 1:00:49.454
It doesn't matter anymore.

1:00:52.294 --> 1:00:53.761
I've moved on.

1:00:54.497 --> 1:00:56.279
Where have you moved on to?

1:00:56.332 --> 1:00:57.822
<i>Another agency?</i>

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:00.892
Who's with you?

1:01:01.003 --> 1:01:03.232
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1:01:03.272 --> 1:01:07.436
<i>You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!</i>

1:01:07.476 --> 1:01:09.671
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1:01:09.778 --> 1:01:10.836
<i>Tugg?</i>

1:01:14.150 --> 1:01:15.536
Please don't fire me.

1:01:16.318 --> 1:01:17.572
I did it, I did it!

1:01:17.620 --> 1:01:20.015
Vivica, what do I have scheduled
this afternoon?

1:01:20.055 --> 1:01:22.922
<i>?i>Two and a Half Me> taping.
–Shit.</i>

1:01:23.926 --> 1:01:24.950
Cancel it.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:26.789
<i>And get me Tugg's Tropic Thunder
contract.</i>

1:01:26.829 --> 1:01:30.025
I'm going to Grossman's office,
I'm playing the card.

1:01:30.065 --> 1:01:31.032
Okay.

1:01:34.637 --> 1:01:37.538
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1:01:37.673 --> 1:01:39.732
He doesn't look too good.

1:01:39.842 --> 1:01:44.870
Must drink,
so I can throw something up!

1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:47.176
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1:01:47.216 --> 1:01:48.308
No, don't!

1:01:48.417 --> 1:01:50.942
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

1:01:51.053 --> 1:01:53.482
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1:01:53.522 --> 1:01:55.518
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1:01:55.558 --> 1:01:57.520
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1:01:57.560 --> 1:01:59.288
Did you need another revenue stream?

1:01:59.328 --> 1:02:02.126
For your information,
my revenue stream

1:02:02.231 --> 1:02:04.627
currently generates $2 million a year

1:02:04.667 --> 1:02:06.662
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1:02:06.702 --> 1:02:09.098
–Hot damn.
–And why am I in this movie?

1:02:09.138 --> 1:02:11.534
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1:02:11.574 --> 1:02:13.435
because they had one good part
in it for a black man

1:02:13.475 --> 1:02:15.917
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

1:02:17.146 --> 1:02:20.776
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1:02:20.816 --> 1:02:23.012
I just wanted to throw another shrimp
on your barbie.

1:02:23.052 --> 1:02:24.246
That shit ain't funny.

1:02:24.286 --> 1:02:27.049
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1:02:27.089 --> 1:02:28.717
I'm just fucking with you,
Kangaroo Jack!

1:02:28.757 --> 1:02:30.553
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1:02:30.593 --> 1:02:33.122
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1:02:33.162 --> 1:02:35.891
–You about to cross some fucking lines.
–Guys, relax and stuff.

1:02:35.931 --> 1:02:37.059
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1:02:37.099 --> 1:02:40.333
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me

1:02:44.506 --> 1:02:46.064
For 400 years,

1:02:47.109 --> 1:02:50.010
that word has kept us down.

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:52.707
What the fuck?

1:02:52.815 --> 1:02:56.581
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1:02:56.685 --> 1:02:59.586
Now we up in the big leagues,

1:02:59.688 --> 1:03:01.451
getting our turn at bat.

1:03:01.557 --> 1:03:04.219
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1:03:04.893 --> 1:03:08.290
<i>That's the theme song for
The Jeffersons. You really need help.</i>

1:03:08.330 --> 1:03:11.527
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1:03:11.567 --> 1:03:13.562
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1:03:13.602 --> 1:03:17.099
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1:03:17.139 --> 1:03:19.733
Guys! Hey, guys!

1:03:20.342 --> 1:03:22.810
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1:03:25.180 --> 1:03:28.013
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need

1:03:29.051 --> 1:03:32.316
I need to wear his stomach skin
like a unitard.

1:03:33.289 --> 1:03:36.588
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1:03:36.692 --> 1:03:41.561
Now, if Mr Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1:03:41.664 --> 1:03:44.172
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:46.618
We got ground to cover!

1:04:15.397 --> 1:04:18.662
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

1:04:19.568 --> 1:04:21.297
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1:04:29.378 --> 1:04:31.874
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1:04:31.914 --> 1:04:33.776
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1:04:33.816 --> 1:04:36.679
<i>like, Adventures of Ford Fairlane,
you know,</i>

1:04:36.719 --> 1:04:40.416
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1:04:40.456 --> 1:04:42.951
<i>And Cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's incredible.</i>

1:04:42.991 --> 1:04:46.522
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1:04:46.562 --> 1:04:48.723
it's absolutely amazing.

1:04:48.831 --> 1:04:50.731
Shut the fuck up!

1:04:55.371 --> 1:04:57.032
Who send you here?

1:04:57.139 --> 1:05:01.769
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

1:05:02.511 --> 1:05:07.915
Serial number 694529987.

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:14.712
Perhaps some hot tea
will make conversing

1:05:14.823 --> 1:05:16.586
a little easier.

1:05:20.362 --> 1:05:22.540
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1:05:25.934 --> 1:05:28.864
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1:05:28.904 --> 1:05:32.534
–in order to calm your nerves.
–Tayback, John, Sergeant,

1:05:32.574 --> 1:05:37.534
United States Army, 694529987.

1:05:38.380 --> 1:05:43.909
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1:05:49.558 --> 1:05:51.924
Dude, you all right?

1:05:52.027 --> 1:05:53.522
Man you totally leaned into that.

1:05:53.562 --> 1:05:56.664
I was pulling it back
and you just came in too

1:05:56.732 --> 1:05:58.927
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1:06:01.470 --> 1:06:03.465
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1:06:03.505 --> 1:06:05.097
–Let's go.
–Get up.

1:06:05.207 --> 1:06:06.869
I rather rot in your V.C. Jail!

1:06:06.909 --> 1:06:10.777
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1:06:10.879 --> 1:06:12.975
Now say this
and go to the beginning again,

1:06:13.015 --> 1:06:14.863
let's do the tea part, okay?

1:06:16.318 --> 1:06:18.046
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1:06:18.086 --> 1:06:19.948
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1:06:19.988 --> 1:06:23.185
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp

1:06:23.225 --> 1:06:25.187
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1:06:25.227 --> 1:06:27.489
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1:06:27.529 --> 1:06:29.825
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

1:06:29.865 --> 1:06:31.526
All right. All right.

1:06:36.104 --> 1:06:38.095
Are you okay, Jeff?

1:06:38.207 --> 1:06:39.572
I'm awesome.

1:06:41.977 --> 1:06:43.444
Holy shit!

1:06:47.983 --> 1:06:50.161
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1:06:54.857 --> 1:06:56.347
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1:06:56.458 --> 1:06:59.956
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1:06:59.962 --> 1:07:01.657
Speedman was right?

1:07:01.763 --> 1:07:03.128
I don't think so.

1:07:03.232 --> 1:07:06.070
Look at the cooking vats,
the armed guards.

1:07:07.069 --> 1:07:09.511
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1:07:10.272 --> 1:07:11.467
We were in that chopper for hours.

1:07:11.507 --> 1:07:13.836
I don't even think
we're in Vietnam anymore.

1:07:13.876 --> 1:07:16.310
–Fuck.
–Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

1:07:16.411 --> 1:07:19.175
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1:07:19.281 --> 1:07:20.839
What the fuck is Laos?

1:07:20.949 --> 1:07:22.177
It's the Golden Triangle.

1:07:22.217 --> 1:07:24.185
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1:07:24.286 --> 1:07:26.315
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1:07:26.355 --> 1:07:30.447
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

1:07:30.492 --> 1:07:33.088
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle,
dumbass.

1:07:33.128 --> 1:07:35.494
This is the Golden Triangle.

1:07:35.597 --> 1:07:37.226
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1:07:37.266 --> 1:07:38.652
How do you know that?

1:07:38.667 --> 1:07:42.429
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1:07:43.205 --> 1:07:44.502
Cut!

1:07:44.606 --> 1:07:46.073
Oh, Jesus!

1:07:46.174 --> 1:07:48.665
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1:07:48.777 --> 1:07:50.142
Damien, cut!

1:07:51.914 --> 1:07:53.506
Hey, Damien, cut!

1:07:54.349 --> 1:07:56.010
They got Speedman.

1:07:56.585 --> 1:07:58.235
And it doesn't look good.

1:08:30.686 --> 1:08:31.983
I am Tran.

1:08:32.955 --> 1:08:35.595
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1:08:36.525 --> 1:08:39.153
You are DE. A. Scum!

1:08:41.096 --> 1:08:44.532
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1:08:50.839 --> 1:08:52.329
Do you want to die?

1:08:53.108 --> 1:08:54.575
–Do you?
–No!

1:08:54.676 --> 1:08:58.806
Please, don't hurt me!

1:09:06.688 --> 1:09:07.882
Say that again.

1:09:08.890 --> 1:09:10.687
Please, don't hurt me.

1:09:10.792 --> 1:09:13.886
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1:09:14.863 --> 1:09:15.852
Say it!

1:09:15.964 --> 1:09:19.957
Please, don't hurt me!

1:09:35.584 --> 1:09:38.178
–What?
–You are Simple Jack.

1:09:41.156 --> 1:09:43.021
<i>You saw Simple Jack?</i>

1:09:43.125 --> 1:09:45.897
We love the tale of this man,
Simple Jack.

1:09:47.162 --> 1:09:49.057
We do not have many luxury here.

1:09:49.097 --> 1:09:51.593
<i>And Simple Jack is the only movie
we possess.</i>

1:09:51.633 --> 1:09:55.467
You got the VHS.

1:09:55.570 --> 1:09:57.699
We've watched it many, many times.

1:09:57.739 --> 1:10:00.207
You should've got Oscar.

1:10:03.245 --> 1:10:05.008
Well, you know. It's

1:10:06.281 --> 1:10:07.609
Just to be nominated

1:10:07.649 --> 1:10:08.903
You were nominated?

1:10:08.984 --> 1:10:10.579
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1:10:10.619 --> 1:10:13.849
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1:10:13.889 --> 1:10:16.318
It's just?It's very political.
You have to take out ads

1:10:16.358 --> 1:10:18.849
–Shut up now!
–Okay. Okay.

1:10:19.695 --> 1:10:21.424
So, are you going to

1:10:23.065 --> 1:10:24.692
let me go, or

1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:26.927
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1:10:27.035 --> 1:10:28.832
Much more money now!

1:10:40.415 --> 1:10:41.476
He's in a meeting.

1:10:41.516 --> 1:10:44.882
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

1:10:45.320 --> 1:10:47.249
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1:10:47.289 --> 1:10:50.018
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1:10:50.058 --> 1:10:51.616
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:53.528 --> 1:10:55.428
What do you need, Peck?

1:10:55.530 --> 1:10:58.158
No, more like what do you need, Les?

1:10:58.266 --> 1:10:59.460
Glasses?

1:11:00.535 --> 1:11:01.593
What?

1:11:01.703 --> 1:11:04.266
<i>So you can read
the Tropic Thunder contract</i>

1:11:04.306 --> 1:11:06.768
that guarantees my client,
Tugg Speedman,

1:11:06.808 --> 1:11:10.539
some form of digital video recorder
on location.

1:11:11.313 --> 1:11:13.821
–Huh?
–I can't believe you let him in.

1:11:15.083 --> 1:11:17.979
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1:11:18.019 --> 1:11:21.149
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1:11:21.189 --> 1:11:23.214
No, not you, Helen.

1:11:23.325 --> 1:11:27.089
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1:11:27.129 --> 1:11:28.653
Perfect.

1:11:28.764 --> 1:11:31.259
Hey, Tuggernuts,
I've got you on speakerphone.

1:11:31.299 --> 1:11:33.228
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

1:11:33.268 --> 1:11:36.498
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1:11:36.538 --> 1:11:39.178
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1:11:40.041 --> 1:11:42.032
We are Flaming Dragon.

1:11:42.144 --> 1:11:44.510
Speedman is with us now.

1:11:44.613 --> 1:11:48.174
<i>For 50 million, you will get him back.</i>

1:11:48.283 --> 1:11:50.512
–Are you gonna get those
–Who is this?

1:11:50.552 --> 1:11:53.315
–And how did you get this phone?
–We are Flaming Dragon!

1:11:53.355 --> 1:11:55.269
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1:11:57.993 --> 1:12:00.018
He does, does he?

1:12:00.128 --> 1:12:02.596
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1:12:02.697 --> 1:12:05.193
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1:12:05.233 --> 1:12:07.262
But if you think
you can poach my client

1:12:07.302 --> 1:12:11.922
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

1:12:11.940 --> 1:12:13.502
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

1:12:13.542 --> 1:12:15.840
This is Flaming Dragon!

1:12:15.944 --> 1:12:18.708
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

1:12:18.814 --> 1:12:23.649
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:27.816
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1:12:27.856 --> 1:12:30.385
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1:12:30.425 --> 1:12:31.787
<i>So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.</i>

1:12:31.827 --> 1:12:33.255
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,</i>

1:12:33.295 --> 1:12:36.725
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1:12:36.765 --> 1:12:38.460
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:42.597
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1:12:42.637 --> 1:12:45.300
I am talking scorched earth,
motherfucker!

1:12:45.340 --> 1:12:47.103
I will massacre you!

1:12:47.209 --> 1:12:49.143
I will fuck you up!

1:12:56.952 --> 1:13:00.252
–Could you find out who that was? Go.
–Yeah. Yeah.

1:13:34.122 --> 1:13:37.114
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1:13:37.225 --> 1:13:38.954
Okay.

1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:42.558
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great

1:13:44.799 --> 1:13:46.426
Put teeth in!

1:13:53.541 --> 1:13:55.406
Now do movie.

1:13:55.510 --> 1:13:57.171
The whole movie?

1:13:57.279 --> 1:13:59.007
I can't. I don't know the whole

1:13:59.047 --> 1:14:01.538
You perform! You perform or die!

1:14:02.284 --> 1:14:03.774
Monkey swine!

1:14:06.688 --> 1:14:08.087
Pa.

1:14:10.058 --> 1:14:11.423
More stupid!

1:14:13.194 --> 1:14:18.257
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1:14:20.702 --> 1:14:22.033
You saw what I saw.

1:14:22.137 --> 1:14:24.799
Tugg Speedman is dead meat
if we don't do something soon.

1:14:24.839 --> 1:14:27.269
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1:14:27.309 --> 1:14:28.703
which is in the other direction!

1:14:28.743 --> 1:14:30.335
Ain't right.

1:14:30.445 --> 1:14:32.540
<i>What would've happened
in The Great Escape</i>

1:14:32.580 --> 1:14:36.414
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1:14:36.518 --> 1:14:40.582
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1:14:40.622 --> 1:14:43.318
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1:14:43.358 --> 1:14:44.619
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1:14:44.659 --> 1:14:48.623
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1:14:48.663 --> 1:14:53.151
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1:14:56.004 --> 1:14:58.566
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1:14:58.606 --> 1:15:01.666
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1:15:01.776 --> 1:15:03.744
Crazy's better than nothing.

1:15:03.845 --> 1:15:07.804
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1:15:07.916 --> 1:15:11.249
<i>?i>Sex Camp> Remember it?
–Yeah.</i>

1:15:11.353 --> 1:15:15.312
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1:15:15.423 --> 1:15:17.948
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1:15:18.059 --> 1:15:19.754
So, what we did,

1:15:19.861 --> 1:15:22.897
we built a catapult
out of logs and underwear,

1:15:22.964 --> 1:15:26.594
and they shot us over the wall,
and we parachuted down.

1:15:32.140 --> 1:15:33.505
Look,

1:15:33.608 --> 1:15:35.737
you guys, we already know the plan.

1:15:35.777 --> 1:15:37.806
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1:15:37.846 --> 1:15:42.215
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1:15:42.317 --> 1:15:44.717
<i>The book of Tropic Thunder.</i>

1:15:44.819 --> 1:15:47.049
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1:15:48.356 --> 1:15:51.720
The flap, I read the back flap
and saw the pictures.

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:54.956
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1:15:54.996 --> 1:15:56.054
Cool.

1:15:58.033 --> 1:16:00.593
You guys all read the script, right?

1:16:00.702 --> 1:16:03.408
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1:16:03.972 --> 1:16:05.500
What the hell does that even mean?

1:16:05.540 --> 1:16:10.094
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1:16:12.247 --> 1:16:14.161
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1:16:15.116 --> 1:16:17.512
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1:16:17.552 --> 1:16:18.079
Osiris and Fats go undercover
as a diversion.

1:16:18.119 --> 1:16:20.515
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in
via the river.

1:16:20.555 --> 1:16:23.393
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1:16:24.826 --> 1:16:25.884
Yeah!

1:16:26.961 --> 1:16:29.953
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1:16:30.065 --> 1:16:34.399
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1:16:34.502 --> 1:16:37.266
Some of us
might not even make it back.

1:16:37.372 --> 1:16:40.466
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1:16:43.178 --> 1:16:46.007
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1:16:46.047 --> 1:16:47.878
–Cool it, Benson.
–Sorry.

1:16:48.950 --> 1:16:53.636
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1:16:54.989 --> 1:16:56.903
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1:17:00.595 --> 1:17:01.789
Okay.

1:17:03.098 --> 1:17:06.192
Flaming Dragon's
a heroin manufacturer.

1:17:06.301 --> 1:17:09.464
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1:17:09.504 --> 1:17:12.735
–Huge profit margin.
–Guys!

1:17:12.841 --> 1:17:15.837
Would somebody please let me know
what the game plan is?

1:17:15.877 --> 1:17:17.606
Peck! We have it handled.

1:17:17.712 --> 1:17:20.275
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1:17:20.315 --> 1:17:22.306
I got it. Got it.

1:17:34.429 --> 1:17:37.158
<i>–Les Grossman.
?i>We not get money yet></i>

1:17:37.198 --> 1:17:39.325
Price now 100 million!

1:17:39.434 --> 1:17:42.267
You pay now,
or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1:17:42.370 --> 1:17:45.430
Great. Let me get this down.

1:17:45.540 --> 1:17:46.973
100 million.

1:17:47.075 --> 1:17:49.543
Wait! I got a better idea.

1:17:50.345 --> 1:17:52.176
Instead of 100 million,

1:17:52.280 --> 1:17:55.147
how about I send you
a hobo's dick cheese?

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:57.612
<i>Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!</i>

1:17:57.652 --> 1:17:59.847
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1:17:59.954 --> 1:18:02.183
–No
–In the meantime, and as usual,

1:18:02.223 --> 1:18:03.884
go fuck yourself!

1:18:04.993 --> 1:18:07.699
–No.
–We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1:18:09.664 --> 1:18:12.460
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.395
–I think I could've done that better.
–I thought it was good.

1:18:14.435 --> 1:18:16.300
They're gonna kill him!

1:18:19.374 --> 1:18:20.432
And?

1:18:22.777 --> 1:18:23.903
“And?

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:29.307
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1:18:31.619 --> 1:18:34.816
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1:18:34.956 --> 1:18:37.618
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1:18:37.725 --> 1:18:41.661
Eventually, and I'm talking way,
way down the road,

1:18:41.763 --> 1:18:43.324
we file an insurance claim.

1:18:43.364 --> 1:18:46.227
Preferably before
the end of the fiscal year.

1:18:46.267 --> 1:18:50.887
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1:18:52.106 --> 1:18:53.869
You can't be serious.

1:18:55.109 --> 1:18:56.738
You kick in the door to my house,

1:18:56.778 --> 1:19:02.239
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1:19:02.350 --> 1:19:06.946
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

1:19:07.055 --> 1:19:09.421
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1:19:13.294 --> 1:19:14.989
Let's face it.

1:19:15.096 --> 1:19:19.123
The kids aren't dressing up as Scorcher
for Purim anymore.

1:19:20.535 --> 1:19:23.527
Speedman is a dying star,

1:19:23.638 --> 1:19:26.869
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1:19:26.975 --> 1:19:29.705
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1:19:29.811 --> 1:19:33.208
We've been handed
an incredible opportunity here, Peck.

1:19:33.248 --> 1:19:37.082
The universe is talking to us right now.

1:19:37.185 --> 1:19:38.743
You just gotta listen.

1:19:51.866 --> 1:19:55.530
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1:19:55.570 --> 1:19:56.662
Yeah.

1:19:56.771 --> 1:19:59.934
Ask and you shall receive.

1:20:00.975 --> 1:20:05.105
–All right.
–You play ball, we play ball.

1:20:05.213 --> 1:20:08.580
I know you want the goodies.

1:20:08.683 --> 1:20:10.674
Welcome to the goody room.

1:20:10.785 --> 1:20:15.415
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1:20:15.523 --> 1:20:16.851
That's how you're gonna roll.

1:20:16.891 --> 1:20:20.850
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1:20:20.962 --> 1:20:22.259
Yeah!

1:20:22.764 --> 1:20:24.026
Playa.

1:20:24.899 --> 1:20:26.230
Playa!

1:20:27.268 --> 1:20:28.565
Big dick playa.

1:20:28.670 --> 1:20:30.661
Swinging past your knees!

1:20:30.772 --> 1:20:31.796
Big dick, baby.

1:20:31.906 --> 1:20:33.100
Yep.

1:20:36.444 --> 1:20:39.038
Or you can grow a conscience

1:20:39.147 --> 1:20:42.711
in the next five minutes
and see where that takes you.

1:20:46.487 --> 1:20:48.580
Let me get this straight.

1:20:48.690 --> 1:20:52.319
You want me
to let my client of 15 years,

1:20:52.427 --> 1:20:53.855
one of my best friends,

1:20:53.895 --> 1:20:58.525
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1:20:59.667 --> 1:21:00.793
Yes.

1:21:05.873 --> 1:21:08.137
A G5 airplane?

1:21:10.244 --> 1:21:11.302
Yes.

1:21:12.380 --> 1:21:15.076
And lots of money.

1:21:16.451 --> 1:21:18.612
Playa.

1:21:21.522 --> 1:21:22.716
Yeah!

1:21:23.958 --> 1:21:26.552
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1:21:29.130 --> 1:21:31.792
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1:21:32.633 --> 1:21:36.364
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1:21:36.471 --> 1:21:37.995
Sorry, Jack.

1:21:38.106 --> 1:21:40.370
She in heaven now.

1:21:41.142 --> 1:21:44.407
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1:21:44.512 --> 1:21:47.640
She sleep forever.

1:21:47.749 --> 1:21:50.945
To the mars credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1:21:50.985 --> 1:21:54.649
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1:21:54.689 --> 1:21:58.553
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1:21:58.593 --> 1:21:59.787
He'll become a naturalist.

1:21:59.827 --> 1:22:01.589
–Yeah.
–Break down the aesthetic distance,

1:22:01.629 --> 1:22:03.358
then the

1:22:06.033 --> 1:22:07.749
Told you I'd tag you back.

1:22:10.338 --> 1:22:12.602
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1:22:12.707 --> 1:22:15.069
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1:22:15.109 --> 1:22:17.538
–I just got caught up in
–In being a dumbass?

1:22:17.578 --> 1:22:18.977
I guess so.

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:21.843
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1:22:21.883 --> 1:22:23.244
–Neither do I.
–It's beyond me.

1:22:23.284 --> 1:22:25.479
–It's beyond me.
–You confused.

1:22:25.586 --> 1:22:27.764
–I am a little confused.
–I know.

1:22:29.123 --> 1:22:30.920
But are we cool?

1:22:31.025 --> 1:22:32.356
Not really.

1:22:36.164 --> 1:22:37.756
Hey, man.

1:22:37.865 --> 1:22:39.627
–How's it going?
–Good. Yourself?

1:22:39.667 --> 1:22:41.692
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1:22:41.803 --> 1:22:44.732
I think I'm just gonna hang back here
for the mission.

1:22:44.772 --> 1:22:46.399
Watch the stuff.

1:22:46.507 --> 1:22:48.532
–Is that cool?
–What? No!

1:22:48.643 --> 1:22:50.543
We need you, Jeff.

1:22:50.645 --> 1:22:52.306
What are you talking about?

1:22:52.346 --> 1:22:53.904
Okay, look, man.

1:22:55.149 --> 1:22:57.525
–I got something to tell you.
–Okay.

1:22:59.687 --> 1:23:02.417
You know those jellybeans
I was eating?

1:23:02.523 --> 1:23:05.617
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1:23:06.527 --> 1:23:09.325
–They were drugs.
–Really?

1:23:09.430 --> 1:23:13.861
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1:23:13.901 --> 1:23:17.663
I'm gonna fucking do all the heroin
in the fucking world.

1:23:20.141 --> 1:23:25.091
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:29.446
–Are you serious?
–Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1:23:29.550 --> 1:23:32.480
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:34.148
until it is out of my system.

1:23:34.188 --> 1:23:35.883
I'm gonna say,
“Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1:23:35.923 --> 1:23:37.552
I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me.

1:23:37.592 --> 1:23:40.855
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1:23:40.895 --> 1:23:42.226
You got it!

1:23:42.897 --> 1:23:44.956
Goodbye, Mama!

1:23:45.066 --> 1:23:48.194
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1:23:48.302 --> 1:23:53.262
I'll see you tonight, when I go to bed,
in my head movies.

1:23:54.208 --> 1:23:58.804
But this head movie
makes my eyes rain.

1:24:07.855 --> 1:24:11.086
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1:24:12.960 --> 1:24:15.857
–They got him on the move!
–That's torture, man.

1:24:15.897 --> 1:24:18.764
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1:24:18.866 --> 1:24:21.128
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1:24:21.168 --> 1:24:22.630
Say, are you good
with a needle and thread?

1:24:22.670 --> 1:24:23.694
Hell, yeah.

1:24:23.804 --> 1:24:27.201
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1:24:27.241 --> 1:24:30.739
–I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
–Let's roll out.

1:25:01.943 --> 1:25:04.173
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1:25:10.785 --> 1:25:13.185
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1:25:14.889 --> 1:25:16.857
And you can call me

1:25:17.925 --> 1:25:19.222
Papa.

1:25:42.717 --> 1:25:44.631
Wow, look at all those stars.

1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:48.862
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1:25:49.924 --> 1:25:53.290
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1:25:53.461 --> 1:25:54.928
Man, that's beauty.

1:25:56.864 --> 1:25:59.994
Nights like tonight
make a man wonder what it's all about.

1:26:00.034 --> 1:26:02.806
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1:26:04.171 --> 1:26:05.297
Don't ignore me!

1:26:05.406 --> 1:26:08.574
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1:26:09.410 --> 1:26:11.469
–Hey, Kirk?
–Yeah?

1:26:11.579 --> 1:26:14.412
Are you still dating
Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1:26:14.515 --> 1:26:15.977
'Cause I think she's hot.

1:26:16.017 --> 1:26:19.384
No, that was just some
tabloid conjecture.

1:26:19.487 --> 1:26:23.513
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1:26:24.558 --> 1:26:25.889
Funny, huh?

1:26:25.993 --> 1:26:28.897
The circus life 280 days a year
on location.

1:26:30.131 --> 1:26:34.025
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1:26:34.835 --> 1:26:36.894
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1:26:37.004 --> 1:26:39.302
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1:26:39.407 --> 1:26:40.465
No, it's Kevin.

1:26:40.574 --> 1:26:42.370
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1:26:42.410 --> 1:26:44.705
<i>I didn't tell you, but Fatties: Fart Three
is coming down the pike,</i>

1:26:44.745 --> 1:26:48.309
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1:26:48.349 --> 1:26:50.978
Jeff, you're just going to
have to tough it out.

1:26:51.018 --> 1:26:53.047
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1:26:53.087 --> 1:26:54.418
Jesus, man.

1:26:55.456 --> 1:26:56.923
Hey, man.

1:26:57.024 --> 1:26:59.987
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1:27:00.027 --> 1:27:03.428
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1:27:03.531 --> 1:27:05.226
How about you, man?

1:27:05.366 --> 1:27:07.862
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1:27:07.902 --> 1:27:09.369
Me?

1:27:09.470 --> 1:27:12.234
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and

1:27:13.074 --> 1:27:16.804
I was really hoping I'd get laid
when this movie came out,

1:27:16.844 --> 1:27:19.244
but that's not gonna happen.

1:27:20.114 --> 1:27:21.642
What about you, Masterblaster?

1:27:21.682 --> 1:27:24.378
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1:27:24.418 --> 1:27:29.151
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1:27:29.256 --> 1:27:30.551
No. You missing me, man.

1:27:30.591 --> 1:27:32.453
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1:27:32.493 --> 1:27:33.687
How about it?

1:27:34.462 --> 1:27:35.588
Yeah.

1:27:36.997 --> 1:27:38.965
Yeah, there is.

1:27:39.066 --> 1:27:42.463
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1:27:42.503 --> 1:27:44.403
No. I mean

1:27:44.505 --> 1:27:49.340
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1:27:49.443 --> 1:27:51.138
It's?It's complicated.

1:27:51.245 --> 1:27:53.679
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1:27:53.781 --> 1:27:56.444
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1:27:56.484 --> 1:28:00.181
“Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date.?That's the end of story.

1:28:00.221 --> 1:28:02.917
–What's her name?
–Lance.

1:28:03.023 --> 1:28:04.786
“Listen here, Lance…

1:28:05.659 --> 1:28:09.459
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1:28:09.563 --> 1:28:11.292
–Did you say “Lance?
–No!

1:28:11.398 --> 1:28:13.394
–That sounded like “Lance.
–No, I said “Nance.

1:28:13.434 --> 1:28:15.663
–That's what I said, “Nance.
–It sounded like “Lance.

1:28:15.703 --> 1:28:17.298
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1:28:17.338 --> 1:28:19.066
I love the pussy! All right?

1:28:19.106 --> 1:28:21.102
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1:28:21.142 --> 1:28:22.536
<i>When you wrote I Love Tha Pussy</i>

1:28:22.576 --> 1:28:26.006
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1:28:26.046 --> 1:28:28.412
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1:28:28.516 --> 1:28:31.512
–Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
–I'm not gay!

1:28:31.552 --> 1:28:32.576
This Hollywood.

1:28:32.686 --> 1:28:33.814
How about we all get back to work?

1:28:33.854 --> 1:28:35.583
–Okay. Cool.
–This is ridiculous!

1:28:35.623 --> 1:28:38.593
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1:28:41.095 --> 1:28:45.930
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1:28:46.033 --> 1:28:49.264
I told you, for the last time,
I love the pussy!

1:28:50.638 --> 1:28:53.471
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1:28:53.574 --> 1:28:56.668
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1:28:56.777 --> 1:28:59.351
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1:29:05.419 --> 1:29:06.547
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1:29:06.587 --> 1:29:08.048
Are you gonna talk Vietnamese
to those dudes?

1:29:08.088 --> 1:29:09.851
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1:29:09.957 --> 1:29:11.719
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1:29:11.759 --> 1:29:13.387
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1:29:13.427 --> 1:29:16.957
<i>Land of Silk and Money with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.</i>

1:29:16.997 --> 1:29:21.028
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1:29:21.068 --> 1:29:23.002
That might be our ride.

1:29:39.753 --> 1:29:41.048
The straps are too tight!

1:29:41.088 --> 1:29:43.454
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1:30:11.352 --> 1:30:14.321
The straps are cutting off
my circulation!

1:30:14.421 --> 1:30:15.388
Fuck you!

1:30:22.897 --> 1:30:25.801
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1:31:19.853 --> 1:31:22.549
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1:31:27.061 --> 1:31:29.325
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1:31:39.473 --> 1:31:40.667
Okay.

1:31:42.876 --> 1:31:44.434
All right.

1:31:44.545 --> 1:31:47.007
That looks like it could be
the munitions hut right there.

1:31:47.047 --> 1:31:50.479
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1:32:07.001 --> 1:32:10.764
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1:32:10.804 --> 1:32:11.930
Oh, fuck!

1:32:27.454 --> 1:32:29.046
Get over here!

1:32:30.424 --> 1:32:32.052
–What are you guys doing here?
–He has hands.

1:32:32.092 --> 1:32:34.492
–He killed Damien.
–Bullshit!

1:32:34.595 --> 1:32:37.103
–He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
–Almost!

1:32:37.197 --> 1:32:40.461
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1:32:40.501 --> 1:32:42.059
Sweet. Thank God.

1:32:42.169 --> 1:32:44.941
–We busting Speedman out.
–Speedmars here?

1:33:12.533 --> 1:33:15.195
I take it y'all are doing
the Wet Offensive from the book.

1:33:15.235 --> 1:33:16.563
I can give y'all a diversion.

1:33:16.603 --> 1:33:22.081
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1:34:02.015 --> 1:34:04.483
Yes, your farm.

1:34:08.856 --> 1:34:11.256
Where is your farm,

1:34:12.826 --> 1:34:14.293
American?

1:34:17.131 --> 1:34:18.393
My farm?

1:34:20.334 --> 1:34:21.596
Oh, shit.

1:34:22.369 --> 1:34:25.566
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1:34:25.672 --> 1:34:27.162
Yeah!

1:34:32.112 --> 1:34:35.104
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1:34:36.116 --> 1:34:37.310
Kwan-Lo!

1:34:38.819 --> 1:34:40.931
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1:34:41.221 --> 1:34:42.381
Yeah!

1:34:43.957 --> 1:34:47.257
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
keep your head down!

1:34:47.261 --> 1:34:49.525
Keep your head down on the ground!

1:34:49.630 --> 1:34:51.859
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1:34:51.899 --> 1:34:55.335
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1:34:55.435 --> 1:34:58.063
Now show me where the drugs are.

1:34:58.172 --> 1:34:59.969
What the fuck?

1:35:00.073 --> 1:35:01.768
That ain't the plan!

1:35:01.875 --> 1:35:03.570
Don't judge me!

1:35:07.247 --> 1:35:09.359
He's got a real serious problem.

1:35:09.816 --> 1:35:12.080
Hey! Hey, you!

1:35:12.186 --> 1:35:14.381
Take off your clothes!

1:35:14.488 --> 1:35:16.149
Take off your clothes!

1:35:16.256 --> 1:35:17.553
What do we do now?

1:35:17.658 --> 1:35:19.553
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1:35:19.593 --> 1:35:22.055
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1:35:22.095 --> 1:35:25.462
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1:35:25.566 --> 1:35:27.528
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1:35:27.568 --> 1:35:30.059
–Door!
–One, two, three!

1:35:43.350 --> 1:35:45.181
I go high, you go low.

1:35:49.556 --> 1:35:53.487
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1:35:53.527 --> 1:35:57.751
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1:35:58.398 --> 1:35:59.831
Come on, come on!

1:35:59.933 --> 1:36:02.243
–Smoke grenade.
–Don't drop it now.

1:36:02.603 --> 1:36:04.161
Here.

1:36:04.271 --> 1:36:06.333
–What's this?
–I don't know what it's called.

1:36:06.373 --> 1:36:06.733
–What's this?
–I don't know what it's called.

1:36:06.773 --> 1:36:09.436
I just know the sound it makes
when it lies.

1:36:09.476 --> 1:36:13.003
Don't move, Matchbox,
or I will shoot you.

1:36:13.113 --> 1:36:15.980
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1:36:16.083 --> 1:36:17.812
I can still see you.

1:36:23.957 --> 1:36:25.049
Tugg!

1:36:27.594 --> 1:36:28.754
Tugg?

1:36:30.831 --> 1:36:32.025
Gotcha.

1:36:33.200 --> 1:36:36.101
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1:36:36.203 --> 1:36:37.329
Home?

1:36:39.473 --> 1:36:43.370
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1:36:43.410 --> 1:36:45.970
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1:36:48.282 --> 1:36:51.410
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it

1:36:51.518 --> 1:36:53.713
My son gave this to me.

1:36:53.820 --> 1:36:57.312
–That's your stick buddy?
–His name is Twigman.

1:36:57.424 --> 1:36:59.255
Does he wanna come with us?

1:37:20.247 --> 1:37:22.374
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1:37:22.482 --> 1:37:27.442
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

1:37:27.554 --> 1:37:30.083
<i>I love that pussy, hell, yeah, hell, yeah</i>

1:37:30.123 --> 1:37:31.685
They're not your demo, dude.

1:37:31.725 --> 1:37:34.187
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

1:37:34.227 --> 1:37:37.424
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

1:37:37.531 --> 1:37:43.936
<i>Like him in Carlito's Way?</i>

1:37:44.304 --> 1:37:47.034
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1:37:47.074 --> 1:37:49.008
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1:37:49.109 --> 1:37:53.671
<i>Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

1:37:54.047 --> 1:37:56.880
<i>Cruising. Sea of Love.</i>

1:37:56.983 --> 1:37:59.975
Real Al Pacino.

1:38:00.087 --> 1:38:03.750
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1:38:03.790 --> 1:38:06.920
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1:38:06.960 --> 1:38:08.422
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1:38:08.462 --> 1:38:10.772
On my momma, if you touch that gun

1:38:15.402 --> 1:38:17.802
–Oh, shit, it's on!
–Over here!

1:38:52.205 --> 1:38:54.034
–What're you doing?
–I'm gonna give these boys

1:38:54.074 --> 1:38:55.701
a Hanoi high-five.

1:39:08.355 --> 1:39:09.741
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1:39:10.490 --> 1:39:11.718
Smoke!

1:39:17.564 --> 1:39:19.259
Oh, shit!

1:39:24.104 --> 1:39:25.628
Jeff, don't!

1:39:26.473 --> 1:39:28.464
It doesn't matter what I do.

1:39:28.575 --> 1:39:31.605
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1:39:31.645 --> 1:39:35.709
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1:39:35.749 --> 1:39:37.979
They only laugh at my farts.

1:39:38.084 --> 1:39:40.130
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1:39:40.187 --> 1:39:41.779
This is all I deserve!

1:40:01.942 --> 1:40:04.172
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1:40:04.277 --> 1:40:07.678
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1:40:09.216 --> 1:40:12.780
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1:40:28.335 --> 1:40:29.996
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1:40:30.036 --> 1:40:34.590
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1:40:35.909 --> 1:40:38.776
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1:40:40.714 --> 1:40:42.875
Come on, let's go.

1:40:42.983 --> 1:40:44.978
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1:40:45.018 --> 1:40:46.679
He's on tilt status.

1:40:46.786 --> 1:40:50.817
<i>Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in Moonshot.</i>

1:40:50.857 --> 1:40:53.019
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1:40:53.059 --> 1:40:56.990
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1:40:57.030 --> 1:40:58.158
What're you talking about?

1:40:58.198 --> 1:41:00.627
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1:41:00.667 --> 1:41:05.104
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

1:41:11.011 --> 1:41:13.306
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1:41:13.346 --> 1:41:17.834
–No, fuck that! Just give me this.
–No time! I'll take care of this!

1:41:18.018 --> 1:41:19.998
All right. Give me your hooks.

1:41:20.020 --> 1:41:21.715
Don't worry,
I'm not gonna put them on again.

1:41:21.755 --> 1:41:24.651
–Just give me your goddamn hooks.
–All right. Here.

1:41:24.691 --> 1:41:27.331
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1:41:31.798 --> 1:41:33.959
Shit! Enough!

1:41:34.067 --> 1:41:35.967
Fake shit!

1:41:39.072 --> 1:41:40.198
Fuck!

1:41:47.914 --> 1:41:51.077
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1:41:51.184 --> 1:41:53.277
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1:41:55.322 --> 1:41:57.651
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1:41:57.691 --> 1:41:59.869
–“It's me, Tugg!
–It's me, Tugg.

1:41:59.926 --> 1:42:01.454
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1:42:01.494 --> 1:42:04.292
–Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
–Me?

1:42:04.397 --> 1:42:06.092
I know who I am!

1:42:06.199 --> 1:42:09.930
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1:42:10.036 --> 1:42:11.094
What?

1:42:11.204 --> 1:42:13.366
You a dude
that don't know what dude he is!

1:42:13.406 --> 1:42:16.169
Or are you a dude who has no idea
what dude he is

1:42:16.209 --> 1:42:17.537
and claims to know what dude he is

1:42:17.577 --> 1:42:19.406
What the fuck
are you guys talking about?

1:42:19.446 --> 1:42:20.607
by playing other dudes?

1:42:20.647 --> 1:42:21.908
I know what dude I am!

1:42:21.948 --> 1:42:24.811
–You're scared.
–I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1:42:24.851 --> 1:42:26.113
Or scared of who?

1:42:26.219 --> 1:42:28.882
–Scared of who?
–Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1:42:28.922 --> 1:42:30.184
Scared of you.

1:42:35.095 --> 1:42:37.427
–Jesus.
–What's going on?

1:42:37.530 --> 1:42:39.054
The dudes are emerging.

1:42:39.165 --> 1:42:40.551
He's right, you know.

1:42:42.268 --> 1:42:43.667
I am not

1:42:45.238 --> 1:42:46.933
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1:42:51.344 --> 1:42:52.811
We gotta roll out.

1:42:52.912 --> 1:42:56.143
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1:42:58.385 --> 1:43:01.320
Or Neil Armstrong.

1:43:08.895 --> 1:43:11.056
I think I might be nobody.

1:43:12.465 --> 1:43:13.625
Wow!

1:43:13.733 --> 1:43:16.967
The insecurity level
with you guys is ridiculous!

1:43:17.671 --> 1:43:20.700
–Everybody's got issues!
–Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1:43:20.740 --> 1:43:23.300
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1:43:23.410 --> 1:43:25.639
You're the whole reason
I got into acting.

1:43:25.679 --> 1:43:27.574
I memorized every single monologue

1:43:27.614 --> 1:43:30.276
you ever did
when I was in theater school.

1:43:30.316 --> 1:43:32.362
–Really?
–Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1:43:32.452 --> 1:43:34.948
<i>I saw Scorcher I
24 times when I was in eighth grade.</i>

1:43:34.988 --> 1:43:38.018
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1:43:38.058 --> 1:43:41.254
<i>Yeah, man, Scorcher I was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!</i>

1:43:41.294 --> 1:43:45.424
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last piece
of the puzzle, buddy.

1:43:45.532 --> 1:43:48.700
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1:43:52.872 --> 1:43:54.863
I'm a rooster illusion.

1:43:54.974 --> 1:43:56.236
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1:43:56.276 --> 1:43:59.708
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1:44:01.981 --> 1:44:03.778
Come on, come on, come on.

1:44:07.554 --> 1:44:09.488
Bingo! Move out.

1:44:11.424 --> 1:44:12.789
Oh, God.

1:44:14.761 --> 1:44:17.665
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1:44:22.202 --> 1:44:23.669
Gotta hold on!

1:44:29.843 --> 1:44:31.208
Four Leaf!

1:44:35.949 --> 1:44:37.280
You grew hands?

1:44:46.526 --> 1:44:48.050
RPG, gentlemen!

1:44:50.830 --> 1:44:52.354
Where are you going?

1:44:57.871 --> 1:45:00.973
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1:45:22.428 --> 1:45:23.759
My ass!

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.331
My ass!

1:45:29.936 --> 1:45:33.201
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1:45:33.306 --> 1:45:35.602
We gotta get his cracker ass
to the chopper!

1:45:35.642 --> 1:45:39.942
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1:45:40.046 --> 1:45:41.513
It's Sandusky.

1:45:43.383 --> 1:45:46.682
–Kevin Sandusky.
–That's my name.

1:45:46.786 --> 1:45:48.378
You remembered my name.

1:45:48.488 --> 1:45:50.513
Alpa, go help Cody.

1:45:50.623 --> 1:45:52.685
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1:45:52.725 --> 1:45:54.556
–I got him!
–Let's go!

1:45:55.995 --> 1:45:57.519
Let's get out of here!

1:46:09.409 --> 1:46:10.899
Hey, Leaf!

1:46:11.010 --> 1:46:12.238
–Leaf!
–Yeah.

1:46:12.345 --> 1:46:13.335
Hit the plunger

1:46:13.446 --> 1:46:16.284
–as soon as they clear the bridge!
–Got it!

1:46:19.886 --> 1:46:22.320
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1:46:22.522 --> 1:46:25.320
–Come on! Move!
–Kirk! Wait!

1:46:29.863 --> 1:46:31.558
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1:46:31.598 --> 1:46:33.459
Are you the special effects guy?

1:46:33.499 --> 1:46:35.941
–You God damn right I am.
–Fuck yeah!

1:46:36.035 --> 1:46:37.297
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1:46:37.337 --> 1:46:39.999
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1:46:40.039 --> 1:46:41.601
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1:46:41.641 --> 1:46:44.237
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1:49:26.005 --> 1:49:28.599
–You all right, man?
–I'm cold.

1:49:28.708 --> 1:49:30.699
I can't feel my legs.

1:49:30.810 --> 1:49:33.806
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1:49:33.846 --> 1:49:35.100
–No worries.
–Good.

1:49:35.148 --> 1:49:36.509
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1:49:36.549 --> 1:49:38.925
