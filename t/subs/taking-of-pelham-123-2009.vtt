01:24.500 --> 01:26.092
And so?

01:26.268 --> 01:28.566
And so,
I'm sitting there staring at him, right?

01:28.738 --> 01:31.935
He tells me to get my crunchy
fucking fucknuts the fuck out of there.

01:32.108 --> 01:33.540
You believe that shit?

01:33.708 --> 01:36.108
- You know what I said, right?
- No, what did you say?

01:39.381 --> 01:41.941
- Shit. "Okay."
- You fucking said, "Okay."

01:42.117 --> 01:43.607
I'm sure you did.

02:09.443 --> 02:11.468
<i>Control Center,
this is Stillwell 1215.</i>

02:11.913 --> 02:13.346
Go ahead, Stillwell 1215.

02:13.515 --> 02:15.813
I'm about four cars
out of 57th Street station...

02:15.984 --> 02:17.747
...being delayed
by a red signal light.

02:20.155 --> 02:21.622
Should be green, Stillwell 1215.

02:21.790 --> 02:23.848
Yeah, tell me something
I don't already know.

02:24.658 --> 02:27.856
All right, roll through it slow,
extreme caution, per the rulebook.

02:39.473 --> 02:42.806
Yeah, cracked rail. Nine-hundred feet
from the east end of the platform.

02:42.976 --> 02:45.467
It's the goddamn cold.
Metal contracts, you know that.

02:45.646 --> 02:47.773
I got it, I got it.
How long it take to fix it?

02:47.948 --> 02:50.041
Gotta put a plate on it. Two hours.

02:51.285 --> 02:53.981
Thank you. Make it an hour and a half,
I'll buy you a beer.

03:23.983 --> 03:27.248
Shit, G.B. I hate to see you
down here on the floor, man.

03:27.420 --> 03:31.081
Temporary, baby. I'll be up there
behind the glass before you know it.

03:44.502 --> 03:45.832
I'm gonna need the R train...

03:46.002 --> 03:48.335
...to switch over
to the express tracks at 34th.

03:48.506 --> 03:50.497
- Which express tracks?
- The one that Q uses.

03:50.674 --> 03:53.734
Once they exit the 57th Street,
they can switch over to the F Line.

03:53.911 --> 03:55.003
Straight into Queens.

03:55.179 --> 03:58.615
Once they get to Queens, they switch
back at 36th Street to the R Line.

03:58.783 --> 04:02.946
All you gotta do, suspend the W,
N and R will pick up the slack.

04:48.097 --> 04:49.587
I can't see where I gotta look.

04:49.766 --> 04:52.233
Unlock the door.
Do it now or I'll kill you. Do it.

04:54.269 --> 04:55.293
All right, all right.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.585
Shut up and walk.

05:18.426 --> 05:20.087
First car, go.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.596
See? I told you I could do this.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.471
Big fucking deal,
you did what you said you'd do.

05:52.425 --> 05:54.290
All right.

05:54.461 --> 05:56.929
Five minutes of peace.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.231
- Yeah!
- Nice!

06:03.403 --> 06:05.268
- Nice.
- All right.

06:05.438 --> 06:06.996
There you go.

06:12.412 --> 06:14.141
I'm on the train and I still got you.

06:14.580 --> 06:17.674
<i>- You still got me?
- I got you. What are you doing?</i>

06:17.850 --> 06:19.818
<i>You still got me?</i>

06:21.053 --> 06:23.317
Oh, my God.

06:28.227 --> 06:29.717
Baby? Baby?

07:25.950 --> 07:27.247
Give me the cutting key.

07:28.152 --> 07:29.710
Cutting key.

07:45.835 --> 07:49.601
Control Center calling Pelham 123.
Come in, Pelham 123.

07:50.106 --> 07:52.734
Why did you stop?
You're all green ahead.

07:56.911 --> 07:59.937
<i>Control Center calling Pelham 123.</i>

08:00.815 --> 08:03.283
<i>Control Center calling Pelham 123.</i>

08:03.685 --> 08:05.676
<i>Why did you stop, 123?
You got green ahead.</i>

08:05.854 --> 08:07.719
It's okay.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.882
Life is simple now.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.356
You just gotta do what I say.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.927
Not now, okay?

08:35.049 --> 08:36.278
Where are you from?

08:37.785 --> 08:40.049
- Brooklyn.
- You Irish?

08:40.655 --> 08:41.679
Yeah.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.483
I thought so.

08:45.493 --> 08:48.223
Who's driving Pelham 123?

08:51.966 --> 08:53.695
Maybe something fell on the tracks.

09:39.678 --> 09:41.771
Wait. Are we going backwards?

09:57.329 --> 09:59.729
42nd Street tower,
I got a train wrong-railing...

09:59.898 --> 10:02.765
...on the southbound Lexington
Avenue Line just north of you.

10:04.369 --> 10:07.202
Listen up,
we need to stop and stay in-station.

10:07.372 --> 10:10.466
All southbound locals
just north of the 51 st Street station.

10:10.642 --> 10:13.372
The operator on 123
is Jerry Pollard.

10:13.545 --> 10:16.480
I know Jerry Pollard.
I went to motorman school with Jerry.

10:16.648 --> 10:20.277
Pelham 123,
come in to me, Pelham 123.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.942
Pelham 123, Jerry Pollard,
what's going on down there?

10:23.120 --> 10:26.385
<i>This is Control Center.
What's going on, 123?</i>

10:28.626 --> 10:32.357
Get an express train to go alongside
them, see what we see in the cab.

10:32.530 --> 10:35.966
<i>Yeah, this is South Ferry 105. I can't
get my windshield wiper to turn on.</i>

10:36.133 --> 10:39.568
South Ferry 105, there's a circuit
breaker right behind you for that.

10:39.736 --> 10:41.067
What's going on?

10:41.237 --> 10:43.068
Maestro, what's going on?

11:00.557 --> 11:01.615
- Cop.
- Excuse me.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.157
- Fuck.
- Watch your backs. Watch your backs.

11:04.327 --> 11:05.817
When I say stop, stop it hard.

11:10.968 --> 11:12.491
- Transit Police.
- Stop.

11:25.682 --> 11:27.149
Everybody sit the fuck down!

11:29.351 --> 11:30.443
Down!

11:31.353 --> 11:32.615
Sit the fuck down!

11:32.788 --> 11:35.416
<i>Jesus! We're getting reports
of gunshots down the tunnel.</i>

11:35.591 --> 11:36.922
Sergeant Moran.

11:37.092 --> 11:39.618
- Delgado, let's call off that express.
- Got it.

11:42.498 --> 11:45.365
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna fucking die, man.

11:45.534 --> 11:46.558
Come on! Hey.

11:46.735 --> 11:49.532
Everybody up! By the window!
Come on, up, up, up!

11:49.704 --> 11:51.331
Stand up! Stand up! Come on!

11:55.076 --> 11:57.544
Move it! Against the window!

11:58.879 --> 12:00.744
What the fuck is going on?

12:00.915 --> 12:03.246
<i>There was a cop. Bashkin shot him.</i>

12:03.416 --> 12:05.179
I think... I think he's dead.

12:05.352 --> 12:07.752
Put Bashkin on
and find your fucking guts!

12:07.921 --> 12:10.116
<i>- Do it!
- Fuck.</i>

12:11.758 --> 12:14.488
<i>- What happened?
- A cop. He's dead.</i>

12:14.928 --> 12:16.088
Put the conductor on.

12:17.831 --> 12:19.923
<i>- What's your name, conductor?
- Regina.</i>

12:20.099 --> 12:22.567
Regina, baby, listen,
you got a job to do, honey.

12:22.735 --> 12:23.759
A job?

12:23.936 --> 12:26.837
God put you on this Earth
for one thing and one thing only.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.975
You conduct those people
off the train...

12:29.142 --> 12:31.667
...up to the platform.
You got that? Let me hear it.

12:31.845 --> 12:33.369
<i>Let me hear you do that.</i>

12:35.514 --> 12:36.538
Listen up, everybody.

12:36.715 --> 12:40.515
We're gonna go back to the platform.
I need everybody to...

12:40.686 --> 12:41.914
<i>Regina. Let's do it again.</i>

12:42.087 --> 12:43.384
Conduct those people.

12:44.757 --> 12:47.590
Listen. Now, we're gonna head back
towards the platform.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.591
I want everybody to slowly get up.

12:49.762 --> 12:52.094
<i>- I'm gonna get you off this train.
- Good.</i>

12:52.264 --> 12:56.098
Now, we're gonna be on the tracks,
so if you don't need it, leave it.

13:08.013 --> 13:09.604
<i>Have been put on alert regarding...</i>

13:09.781 --> 13:12.648
Right here, right here.
Right here, right here.

13:12.817 --> 13:14.513
Cross right here, right here.

13:14.687 --> 13:18.248
- Go.
- Cross over right here, right here.

13:18.424 --> 13:19.448
Let's go.

13:19.625 --> 13:21.923
- Up the stairs, up the stairs.
- Here you go.

13:22.094 --> 13:25.028
- Every cop in the city is on the way.
- Maybe it wasn't gunshots.

13:25.196 --> 13:27.664
Train could be blowing breakers.
Or the motor blew?

13:27.832 --> 13:30.027
No, this is on purpose.

13:30.902 --> 13:32.233
Fuck you.

13:32.403 --> 13:34.530
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- Get the fuck off the walls.

13:34.706 --> 13:36.765
Shut the fuck up and come on.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.501
Shit. Come on.

13:40.478 --> 13:44.208
Ramos.
Turn the power off from there down.

13:44.381 --> 13:45.439
What?

13:45.615 --> 13:47.914
Turn the power off from there down!

13:48.086 --> 13:50.213
Okay, I got it!

13:52.957 --> 13:54.754
My fucking lucky day.

13:57.595 --> 14:01.121
Shit.
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

14:16.779 --> 14:20.738
<i>Pelham 123 to Rail Control Center.
Do you read me?</i>

14:23.085 --> 14:24.780
Yes, I read you, Pelham 123.

14:24.954 --> 14:27.718
This is Control Center. Who is this?

14:28.791 --> 14:32.658
It's me, man. I didn't wanna call
till everything was ready.

14:32.827 --> 14:35.387
- It's not Jerry.
- I don't know who it is.

14:37.499 --> 14:39.296
I understand, I understand,
Pelham 123.

14:39.467 --> 14:40.525
Who the hell is this?

14:40.969 --> 14:42.937
This is the man
who's gonna rock this city.

14:43.104 --> 14:45.971
This is the man who's gonna
give the city a run for the money.

14:46.141 --> 14:49.167
<i>Look up. Look up at your screen
and you tell me what you see.</i>

14:49.344 --> 14:51.312
<i>You see what I've done?</i>

14:51.479 --> 14:52.503
I see it.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.706
One car is much more manageable
than 10 with the manpower I got.

14:55.884 --> 14:58.649
Motorman's gonna tell you
about it. Tell him what we got.

14:58.821 --> 15:00.482
They got hostages, lots of them.

15:00.656 --> 15:03.181
<i>- And they got machine guns.
- That's Jerry.</i>

15:03.359 --> 15:05.156
<i>- That's Jerry.
- Yeah, that's right.</i>

15:05.327 --> 15:06.988
Check me,
do you understand that?

15:08.531 --> 15:09.896
I check, I understand.

15:12.334 --> 15:13.858
Didn't I tell you to knock first?

15:15.004 --> 15:18.030
<i>Good, because this is what we call
a cash transaction.</i>

15:18.207 --> 15:20.607
Now, you understand commodities,
don't you?

15:21.042 --> 15:23.738
You know, pork bellies?
Gold? Light crude?

15:23.912 --> 15:28.372
Listen, no disrespect, but maybe I'm
not the guy you should be talking to.

15:28.550 --> 15:30.745
Oh, no, you are exactly the guy
I wanna talk to.

15:30.919 --> 15:33.615
Now, I want you to look at the ticker
and you tell me...

15:33.788 --> 15:37.188
...what is the going rate
for a New York City hostage today?

15:38.926 --> 15:42.089
<i>You think a million dollars
is too much? I do. I think it's corny.</i>

15:42.262 --> 15:44.628
Now get your calculator out.
You got one?

15:48.335 --> 15:50.929
<i>- Do you have a calculator?
- Yeah, we got one. I got one.</i>

15:51.104 --> 15:56.735
Okay, good. Add this up.
You got $526,315 and 79 cents.

15:56.909 --> 16:00.605
<i>That's 526,315. 79.</i>

16:01.980 --> 16:03.538
<i>Now, times that by 19.</i>

16:03.715 --> 16:04.909
What do you got?

16:05.083 --> 16:07.347
What is he, a goddamn accountant?

16:10.721 --> 16:12.484
- That's 10 million?
- What do you got?

16:12.923 --> 16:15.619
That comes out to 10 million
plus one cent.

16:15.793 --> 16:16.817
That is a deal.

16:16.994 --> 16:19.292
You call the mayor
and you tell him the price.

16:19.463 --> 16:23.424
<i>And then you tell him I want it in
100,000 $ 100 bills, you got that?</i>

16:23.803 --> 16:25.395
I got it. What about the one cent?

16:25.571 --> 16:27.299
Keep that, that's your broker fee.

16:27.472 --> 16:30.407
Now, I want the rest
in plain suitcases...

16:30.575 --> 16:33.703
...the kind with the wheels
and the portable handle, okay?

16:33.879 --> 16:36.973
Now, this is not a futures contract.
This is a spot trade.

16:37.148 --> 16:40.174
<i>That means there's a time limit on it.
Okay, you got that?</i>

16:40.352 --> 16:42.582
Now, what do you think
is a fair time limit?

16:45.356 --> 16:47.483
You know, I don't know.
I'm really just a guy...

16:47.658 --> 16:50.627
Come on, give me a time limit.
Give me a fair time limit.

16:53.497 --> 16:55.556
- Thursday.
- I was thinking more like an hour.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.325
Now, what's your watch say?

16:59.503 --> 17:00.594
Two-thirteen.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.534
Oh,
that's exactly what my watch says.

17:02.706 --> 17:05.868
So at 3:13, I want that money here,
motherfucker.

17:06.609 --> 17:09.407
<i>And after that, there is a late fee.</i>

17:09.579 --> 17:12.013
What do you think
that late fee is gonna be?

17:15.352 --> 17:17.147
<i>Come on, tell me what it'll be.</i>

17:17.819 --> 17:20.686
You're gonna kill the passengers?

17:20.857 --> 17:22.790
Oh, commodities
is what I start to kill.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.791
One for every minute
past the deadline I am forced to wait.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.691
They become more valuable
this way...

17:27.864 --> 17:29.388
...and still at the same price.

17:29.832 --> 17:32.300
He's underground.
He's never gonna pull this off.

17:32.468 --> 17:35.095
- Don't tell me, tell him.
- Who the hell is this guy?

17:35.270 --> 17:37.738
- I don't know who it is!
- Garber, just stay with it.

17:37.906 --> 17:39.498
What's your name?

17:39.675 --> 17:41.473
- What's your name, my man?
- My name?

17:42.045 --> 17:43.706
What's your name?

17:44.948 --> 17:46.210
Tell him?

17:47.650 --> 17:48.981
- Garber.
- Garber, okay.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.846
Now, seriously, man,
in 59 minutes...

17:51.019 --> 17:52.782
...I'm gonna start killing passengers.

17:52.955 --> 17:56.254
So my advice to you is to get on
the phone, get the mayor notified now.

17:56.692 --> 17:58.126
Listen, I mean...

17:58.294 --> 18:01.354
I'm just a civil-service employee.
I can't get ahold of the mayor.

18:01.531 --> 18:02.930
That's your problem, not mine.

18:03.099 --> 18:06.465
It's like, who's responsible for
who lives and who dies in New York?

18:06.635 --> 18:08.102
<i>That's New York City's problem.</i>

18:08.270 --> 18:12.263
Get the fuck off the radio
and notify the mayor, motherfucker!

18:14.276 --> 18:16.005
Okay.

18:25.086 --> 18:28.351
Nine months of this and I'm free.
Next mayor gets inaugurated...

18:28.522 --> 18:31.582
...I'm gonna be in Saint-Tropez
on the beach with a piña colada.

18:31.759 --> 18:34.125
I will never have to ride the subway
ever again.

18:34.295 --> 18:37.287
- Never say never, sir.
- Never.

18:37.765 --> 18:39.629
All right,
what's next for the afternoon?

18:39.899 --> 18:41.366
East Harlem Elementary at 2:30.

18:41.534 --> 18:44.059
<i>You're to read
The Cat In The Hat to the third grade.</i>

18:44.237 --> 18:47.536
Every time I go to the schools,
I get sick. They all have runny noses.

18:47.707 --> 18:51.404
Call Dr. Katz, tell him I want him
waiting at the school, with a flu shot.

19:05.558 --> 19:07.254
Mayor's office.

19:11.666 --> 19:14.065
- He's in Car 3.
- Yeah.

19:15.935 --> 19:16.959
What happened?

19:17.404 --> 19:19.338
Somebody just hijacked a 6 train.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.940
It's stopped in the tunnel
between 51 st and 42nd.

19:22.108 --> 19:24.804
Another idiot with a gun.
What do we know?

19:24.978 --> 19:27.606
It's unclear, but I have a car
waiting for us downstairs.

19:27.781 --> 19:29.338
Subway will get us there faster.

19:29.515 --> 19:31.380
All right. Let the doors close.

19:31.550 --> 19:34.111
Tell them we'll meet them
at 59th Street.

19:39.359 --> 19:41.259
Tell the conductor
this is now an express.

19:41.428 --> 19:43.589
- We're skipping the next five stops.
- What?

19:43.763 --> 19:46.196
- I gotta get to work.
- Hold on, hold on.

19:46.365 --> 19:49.425
Everybody will get where they
need to go, we'll make all the stops.

19:49.601 --> 19:52.126
Maybe he's not such a douchebag
after all, huh?

19:53.505 --> 19:54.597
Funny.

19:58.043 --> 20:00.307
Figures you'd be the one
to get a call like this.

20:00.479 --> 20:03.970
Hostage negotiation team here in five
minutes and the mayor's been notified.

20:04.148 --> 20:06.275
- You gonna tell him?
- Get the fuck out of here.

20:06.451 --> 20:08.645
My shift's over in 10 minutes.

20:08.819 --> 20:10.548
- What are you staring at?
- Your face.

20:10.721 --> 20:12.882
I'm trying to remember
for when it's not here.

20:13.056 --> 20:15.957
- You gonna start in on me?
- Right, I'm gonna start in on you.

20:16.126 --> 20:18.220
- Don't fuck this up, Garber.
- You wanna do it?

20:18.396 --> 20:19.953
It's your station, your call.

20:20.130 --> 20:22.496
- Oh, it's my call now?
- That's right. Your call.

20:22.999 --> 20:24.023
Come on.

20:29.239 --> 20:33.175
<i>Pelham 123, come in, this is
Rail Control Center. Are you there?</i>

20:33.610 --> 20:36.203
Gerber Baby boy. What's up?

20:36.912 --> 20:40.746
Garber. Just wanted to let you know
the mayor's been notified.

20:41.183 --> 20:42.377
Are they gonna pay?

20:43.219 --> 20:46.347
I don't know. I'm just the,
what'd you call me? The broker.

20:46.522 --> 20:49.423
No, no, you represent
the city of New York right now, buddy.

20:49.592 --> 20:53.152
I can tell you you're dealing with one
of the all-time bureaucracies, I know.

20:53.328 --> 20:56.388
- I mean, it takes time.
- You'd better fix the bureaucracy...

20:56.564 --> 20:59.328
...because when the time comes,
these hostages...

20:59.501 --> 21:01.992
...are gonna go real quick.

21:03.805 --> 21:06.273
You got it, you got it.
Any other demands?

21:06.441 --> 21:08.409
Yeah,
no fucking pizza for them, either.

21:08.576 --> 21:11.410
No, I mean, are you guys, like,
you know, are you terrorists?

21:11.580 --> 21:14.606
Do I sound like a terrorist?
Do I terrorize you?

21:14.784 --> 21:18.083
Actually, you don't, but I mean,
not that I ever talked to one.

21:18.254 --> 21:19.278
So...

21:19.455 --> 21:22.117
So, what, this is just about money?

21:22.291 --> 21:23.918
Oh, is there anything else?

21:24.093 --> 21:25.354
There's not dying.

21:25.527 --> 21:28.928
Yeah, well, you live, you die. You
go with the current or you fight it...

21:29.097 --> 21:30.758
<i>... you all end up
in the same place.</i>

21:30.932 --> 21:33.901
- Where's that, Jersey?
- Yeah, you watch it. I was born there.

21:34.436 --> 21:36.768
I'm just saying,
you're up in the motorman's cab.

21:36.939 --> 21:40.375
That means you're on the radio, which
means that you're an easy target.

21:40.543 --> 21:42.510
<i>You gotta know the drill.</i>

21:43.745 --> 21:45.440
I know that soon I won't be alone...

21:45.613 --> 21:49.276
...and if I'm the first to get shot,
I'm the first of many to get shot.

21:49.450 --> 21:51.543
That's correct,
but then you'd still be dead.

21:52.387 --> 21:55.618
Dead is an improvement on a lot
of things I can think of, buddy boy.

21:55.790 --> 21:57.280
Sounds like he slept with my ex.

21:59.159 --> 22:01.150
You know, we all owe God a death.

22:01.328 --> 22:05.128
And I'm a man who pays his debts.
Are you a man who pays his debts?

22:05.299 --> 22:08.393
Yeah, yeah, sure.
TV, cable, and my mortgage.

22:08.569 --> 22:12.972
- That's a little like dying once a month.
- You're married, you're a married man.

22:13.307 --> 22:14.331
Maybe.

22:14.508 --> 22:18.841
No, no, no. You're married, man.
Married men have mortgages.

22:19.679 --> 22:21.146
You got a mortgage?

22:21.314 --> 22:24.112
I don't know. Why don't you tell me,
then we'll both know?

22:24.283 --> 22:29.277
I don't know. I'm sure someone
out there loves you dearly and...

22:29.455 --> 22:31.285
<i>... you know,
would be worried about you.</i>

22:31.456 --> 22:33.253
<i>You're in the motorman's cab...</i>

22:33.425 --> 22:35.689
<i>... you got no cover,
sniper on the way.</i>

22:35.861 --> 22:38.329
Well, you know,
circumstances are my protection...

22:38.496 --> 22:41.659
...because right now, you know,
hostages are good insurance.

22:41.834 --> 22:44.359
By the way I see it,
I'm pretty well-protected.

22:47.073 --> 22:50.064
You know, this reminds me
of being in a confessional.

22:50.508 --> 22:52.032
Are you Catholic?

22:52.545 --> 22:53.944
I'm married, you're Catholic.

22:54.113 --> 22:56.172
<i>- Maybe. I don't know.
- No, you're Catholic.</i>

22:56.349 --> 22:57.543
And a good Catholic...

22:57.717 --> 23:00.208
...would know he's got
a trainload of innocent people.

23:00.386 --> 23:02.547
You don't wanna
kill innocent people, do you?

23:02.722 --> 23:05.121
A good Catholic
knows that nobody is innocent.

23:05.290 --> 23:09.090
And I'm not gonna kill all these
hostages. I'd give up my leverage.

23:12.797 --> 23:15.459
Well,
I hope you know what you're doing.

23:15.634 --> 23:19.799
It's running like a fucking Swiss watch
down here, so don't worry about it.

23:21.539 --> 23:23.200
So, what do I call you anyway?

23:24.442 --> 23:25.466
Call me Ryder.

23:26.278 --> 23:27.575
As in "train rider"?

23:27.746 --> 23:29.839
Call me Ryder, with a Y.

23:30.015 --> 23:31.141
<i>Ryder.</i>

23:33.351 --> 23:34.511
<i>I like you, Garber.</i>

23:35.353 --> 23:37.321
I do like you, man.

23:37.488 --> 23:39.479
You may be
the last friend I ever make.

23:41.025 --> 23:44.756
Well, I hope you're wrong, Mr. Ryder.
But, you know, I'm just a guy.

23:44.929 --> 23:47.090
<i>I'm just a guy
on the other end of the mic.</i>

23:48.465 --> 23:50.330
Oh, you don't think
this was meant to be?

23:50.501 --> 23:53.732
You don't think this was fate,
you and me?

23:54.637 --> 23:57.197
I don't know. Things happen
that lead to other things.

23:57.373 --> 23:59.671
And maybe this was one of them,
but that's it.

23:59.842 --> 24:03.437
I never get excited
about coincidence.

24:03.613 --> 24:06.377
Well, you got 50 fucking minutes,
so check me.

24:07.450 --> 24:08.917
All right. 50 minutes, check.

24:09.352 --> 24:11.217
And don't call me
unless you got news.

24:11.387 --> 24:14.185
- You got it.
- Motherfucker.

24:14.624 --> 24:16.023
G.B.

24:16.460 --> 24:17.688
You're fucking good, man.

24:21.864 --> 24:23.695
Okay. Move it the other way.

24:28.570 --> 24:31.971
All right, come on, move it.
The other way.

24:35.477 --> 24:38.071
Okay, now move it back a little less.

24:41.717 --> 24:43.707
Bingo. Got it.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.379
All right, we got it.

25:19.651 --> 25:22.052
- Who's talked to these jokers?
- That would be me.

25:22.222 --> 25:24.053
Yeah, under my supervision.
Who are you?

25:24.224 --> 25:26.488
Vincent Camonetti,
NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

25:26.659 --> 25:28.183
John Johnson,
Chief Transportation Officer.

25:29.530 --> 25:32.693
Walter Garber.
I'm Console Dispatch, right now.

25:32.867 --> 25:34.299
What can you tell me, Walter?

25:34.734 --> 25:36.531
His name is Ryder, with a Y.

25:36.703 --> 25:40.332
And he's asking
for $ 10 million by 3:13.

25:40.507 --> 25:44.637
Looking toward the future. Say what
he'd do if he doesn't get the money?

25:44.811 --> 25:47.371
He said he'd kill a passenger
every minute we go over.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.912
- Starting at 3:13 p. m.?
- 3-1-3, yes, sir.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.880
- Anything else?
- He's smart.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.782
If he's smart, why is he doing
something so fucking stupid?

25:54.954 --> 25:57.184
- On the train radio?
- We can get him right here.

25:57.357 --> 25:59.518
Any chance that we can get
a signal down there?

25:59.692 --> 26:01.557
We'd like to get him
on one of our cells.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.662
No,
there's no chance, not where he is.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.994
What's this?
"Leverage, spot trade"?

26:07.166 --> 26:10.033
Yeah, it's weird. He's like
a money guy, like a Wall Street.

26:10.202 --> 26:13.933
He talked about the passengers
like they were commodities.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.199
- "Catholic"?
- Yeah, I think he's Catholic.

26:16.375 --> 26:19.902
For chrissakes, Garber, you gonna tell
us what his zodiac sign is now?

26:20.079 --> 26:21.979
I'm just saying I think he's Catholic.

26:22.147 --> 26:25.411
Man asked me about "Catholic."
I wrote it down. I'm giving my opinion.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.346
Unlike other people,
I have an opinion.

26:27.518 --> 26:29.748
Fellas, can we settle
this dispute later?

26:29.921 --> 26:31.980
- Absolutely.
- Why do you think he's Catholic?

26:32.156 --> 26:35.614
I think he's Catholic because he talked
about original sin and confessions.

26:35.793 --> 26:38.057
I wrote it down.
I didn't know what else to do.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.889
- Did he ask for a priest?
- No.

26:40.063 --> 26:41.724
Good. Anything else?

26:43.500 --> 26:47.597
He sounded, the way he was talking,
he sounded like he's not afraid to die.

26:48.639 --> 26:49.901
Yeah, well, it's early yet.

26:51.275 --> 26:53.368
- The calls are coming through...?
- Right here.

26:53.544 --> 26:55.512
You hit the blue button,
you can reach him.

26:55.680 --> 26:58.011
- He'll come back to you.
- Mind if I take your seat?

26:58.181 --> 27:00.581
- No, no, go right ahead.
- Thank you, Walter.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.774
You're welcome.

27:01.952 --> 27:04.716
This is the six wire.
You don't have to touch that one.

27:04.888 --> 27:06.412
- Okay.
- That goes around the room.

27:06.590 --> 27:07.818
- Six wire.
- Why don't you...

27:07.991 --> 27:10.084
Just hit the talk here
and then that mutes it.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.353
Take the rest of the day off.
Get out of here.

27:12.529 --> 27:15.053
I thought I'd stick around,
just make sure that...

27:15.231 --> 27:19.691
Well, that wasn't a suggestion.
So why don't you go home?

27:22.771 --> 27:24.136
All right.

27:25.474 --> 27:28.411
This is it. You got all the information
over here about the 313.

27:28.579 --> 27:31.445
- Wait for his call.
- You want me to work it up right now?

27:31.615 --> 27:35.107
You call headquarters, let them know
that I'm here and I'm on the job. Okay.

27:48.731 --> 27:50.426
I gotta take a piss.

27:50.599 --> 27:51.827
So who's stopping you?

27:52.001 --> 27:56.802
All right. We wouldn't wanna end up
on any Amnesty International lists...

27:56.972 --> 27:59.532
...so step up to the door, face out.

27:59.708 --> 28:01.608
Open the middle door.

28:02.377 --> 28:04.174
Do what you gotta do.

28:06.582 --> 28:08.277
Can I jump down there?

28:20.728 --> 28:23.094
- You gotta go or don't you?
- I do, I gotta go.

28:24.299 --> 28:27.462
Step up, my man. Let's go, let's go.

28:37.276 --> 28:40.074
That kid's going places.
All right, close the doors.

28:40.246 --> 28:41.611
<i>Pelham 123, come in.</i>

28:41.781 --> 28:45.478
<i>- Pelham 123, please come in.
- All right, everybody, sit down!</i>

28:56.761 --> 28:57.785
Who is this?

28:57.963 --> 29:01.900
This is Lieutenant Camonetti. I'm with
the NYPD Hostage Negotiation Team.

29:02.068 --> 29:04.730
I'd like to talk to you
about the situation that we're in.

29:04.904 --> 29:06.394
Where the fuck is Garber?

29:06.572 --> 29:08.130
Mr. Garber is a train dispatcher.

29:08.307 --> 29:11.366
- This is now a police matter.
- Yeah, well, I wanna talk to Garber.

29:11.543 --> 29:15.570
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder,
but Mr. Garber is no longer involved.

29:16.815 --> 29:18.305
Motorman, up!

29:19.884 --> 29:21.579
- Put Garber on.
- To be honest...

29:21.753 --> 29:23.312
...Mr. Garber has gone home.

29:23.489 --> 29:25.979
Put Garber on the fucking line
or I kill the motorman.

29:27.892 --> 29:31.954
I guarantee you I am the best person
for you to be talking to right now.

29:32.131 --> 29:33.860
Give me a moment
and I'll explain why.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.028
You were always
gonna be the first one to go.

29:37.470 --> 29:38.562
Oh, Jesus!

29:39.438 --> 29:41.099
Jesus.

29:44.743 --> 29:45.767
Mr. Camonetti...

29:45.944 --> 29:48.777
...you got 60 fucking seconds
before I kill another.

29:48.947 --> 29:52.576
- Okay? Fifty-nine, 58, 57...
- Get him. Just get Garber.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.379
- Fifty-six, 55, 54...
- We're trying to locate Garber...

29:55.553 --> 29:57.544
...ASAP, Mr. Ryder.
Why did you do that?

29:57.722 --> 30:01.282
Mr. Camonetti or whatever
fucking greaseball name you got...

30:01.458 --> 30:03.858
...the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

30:04.028 --> 30:07.225
<i>Fifty-three, 52, 51...</i>

30:10.968 --> 30:12.196
Garber. Garber!

30:12.369 --> 30:15.826
Garber, he killed Jerry Pollard, man.

30:16.005 --> 30:18.599
Come on,
he wants to talk to you right now.

30:20.043 --> 30:21.442
He's here. He's on the way.

30:22.712 --> 30:27.081
Eleven, 10, nine, eight, seven...

30:27.250 --> 30:32.983
- He's approaching the desk.
- Six, five, four, three, two, one...

30:33.155 --> 30:34.622
Hey, it's me, it's Garber.

30:34.991 --> 30:37.323
Garber! You didn't say goodbye.

30:39.262 --> 30:40.286
You killed Jerry?

30:40.463 --> 30:43.558
No, the city of fucking New York
killed Jerry, okay?

30:43.734 --> 30:47.727
<i>The biggest rathole
in the world fucking killed Jerry.</i>

30:47.904 --> 30:50.805
Okay? Now you can
chalk another victim up to NYC.

30:50.973 --> 30:54.101
- Now, can everybody hear me?
- Yeah, we hear you, loud and clear.

30:54.277 --> 30:56.074
Now you don't have to tell
the cops...

30:56.245 --> 31:00.238
...they don't tell me how to do it or how
it's gonna be. I fucking tell them.

31:00.416 --> 31:02.213
Don't you ever, ever
leave me again.

31:02.385 --> 31:05.046
Or I'll just have to hunt you down
and I'll kill you.

31:05.220 --> 31:07.848
Now, you got 39...

31:08.457 --> 31:10.948
Thirty-nine minutes. Check me.

31:11.793 --> 31:12.919
Thirty-nine, check.

31:22.770 --> 31:25.295
This is Staley to ESU 2.
What's your position?

31:25.473 --> 31:27.964
ESU 2 approaching hostage car
from south tunnel.

31:28.409 --> 31:29.671
Go, go, go.

31:31.779 --> 31:34.805
Ten-million dollars. I'll write him
a check and get it over with.

31:34.982 --> 31:38.383
- He wants it in cash.
- I was joking, LaSalle.

31:39.019 --> 31:41.613
But we've been given one hour
to get the money together.

31:41.789 --> 31:44.223
Ten-million dollars.
Where do they get these numbers?

31:44.392 --> 31:46.553
Actually, 10 is the limit, sir.

31:46.727 --> 31:47.751
Why is that?

31:47.928 --> 31:51.193
Request to the City Controller,
he forwards it to one of our lenders...

31:51.365 --> 31:55.391
...cash gets released to the Federal
Reserve. Limit at any time is 10 million.

31:55.568 --> 31:58.230
Some idiot with a gun
wouldn't know that. I didn't know.

31:58.405 --> 32:01.239
- Well, you're very busy, sir.
- How do you know that?

32:02.743 --> 32:04.335
Here he is.

32:04.545 --> 32:07.480
- Henry, what's the situation?
- They killed a hostage.

32:07.648 --> 32:09.674
These guys may be the real deal.

32:09.851 --> 32:11.841
I thought there was one idiot
with a gun.

32:12.019 --> 32:14.715
Multiple gunmen. They're not sure.
They've got 18 hostages.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.120
They'll kill more in an hour. That's
the limit. They want you to know.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.816
- What do we know?
- Not amateurs.

32:19.994 --> 32:21.723
They cut out a car,
stopped on a rise.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.921
They can see us coming
100 yards either way.

32:24.098 --> 32:25.565
How long to get the money?

32:25.733 --> 32:26.893
- I don't know.
- Find out.

32:27.067 --> 32:30.661
- You're not thinking of paying, are you?
- I'm thinking of time and being ready.

32:30.837 --> 32:32.828
Call the Controller.
Tell them we'll pay.

32:35.241 --> 32:37.607
What's with you and Garber, huh?
Tell me about him.

32:37.776 --> 32:38.902
Scheduled to work today?

32:39.077 --> 32:41.272
- Yeah, absolutely. But...
- But what?

32:41.447 --> 32:44.279
He's only had this particular job
for a couple weeks now.

32:44.449 --> 32:47.077
- Well, why is that?
- Well, he's under investigation.

32:47.251 --> 32:48.513
What?

32:48.686 --> 32:51.678
- We were gonna suspend him...
- What's he being investigated for?

32:54.892 --> 32:57.690
He went to Japan. He had to take
a look at some new trains...

32:57.862 --> 32:59.955
...and the allegation
is that he took a bribe.

33:00.131 --> 33:01.791
Took a bribe?
Does he have a record?

33:01.965 --> 33:03.364
- Not that I know.
- You sure?

33:03.533 --> 33:05.967
Yeah, yeah. I don't think so.
I gotta take this.

33:06.169 --> 33:09.366
<i>The identity of the hijackers
is still unclear.</i>

33:09.539 --> 33:13.635
<i>The Hostage Negotiation Team has
just arrived at MTA headquarters...</i>

33:13.810 --> 33:16.745
<i>... to determine
if this is a terrorist enterprise.</i>

33:17.447 --> 33:20.280
Is that what we are? An enterprise?

33:22.052 --> 33:23.280
We're an enterprise.

33:27.324 --> 33:31.693
Well, pilot reports
that the aircraft has begun its descent.

33:37.967 --> 33:40.801
This is Staley to ESU 4.
What's your ETA?

33:40.971 --> 33:43.735
Approximately two minutes
south of target.

33:44.342 --> 33:46.503
Why is the train called
Pelham 123?

33:47.111 --> 33:49.636
Comes out of Pelham Bay
at 1:23 in the afternoon.

33:50.413 --> 33:52.643
How did you end up with this call?

33:52.816 --> 33:54.750
It's a Lexington Avenue train.

33:54.918 --> 33:57.409
I got the Lexington Avenue desk.
Came through my desk.

33:57.587 --> 33:59.782
Can you think of a reason
why you'd be targeted?

33:59.956 --> 34:02.982
Someone wanna hurt you?
Something against you or something?

34:03.159 --> 34:04.387
No.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.525
You recognize his voice?

34:14.103 --> 34:18.096
No. No, as I said, it was a coincidence
it came through my desk.

34:19.507 --> 34:22.841
Did you pick this desk?
Or was it assigned to you?

34:24.478 --> 34:25.844
Did I...?

34:26.014 --> 34:28.983
I said, did you pick this desk
or was it assigned to you?

34:35.324 --> 34:36.723
Can I take my coat off?

34:40.295 --> 34:41.489
Doesn't make any sense.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.391
- What doesn't?
- Guy you're talking to.

34:43.565 --> 34:46.898
He ain't a train dispatcher.
Walter Garber.

34:47.068 --> 34:49.059
- He's a big shot.
- Big shot at what?

34:49.237 --> 34:51.398
Rail Control.
I mean, he runs things up there.

34:51.572 --> 34:54.235
- At least he did before I went up.
- His name is Walter?

34:54.409 --> 34:55.739
Yeah.

34:57.077 --> 35:00.046
Dude like that
shouldn't be answering the phone.

35:05.586 --> 35:08.350
- Mr. Ryder wants to talk to you.
- Right.

35:08.522 --> 35:11.423
Are you sure you don't have
some sort of relationship with him?

35:11.592 --> 35:16.028
I assure you, whatever relationship
I have with him is better than yours.

35:16.195 --> 35:19.097
Jerry, my friend, was killed
while you were talking to Ryder.

35:19.266 --> 35:21.791
Maybe that's a question
you ask yourself instead of me.

35:21.969 --> 35:23.903
I didn't have anything to do
with this.

35:24.071 --> 35:26.767
But what I have in you,
Mr. Garber, is an unknown variable.

35:26.940 --> 35:29.464
- Unknown variable?
- Right. People's lives are at stake.

35:29.642 --> 35:31.109
- I understand that.
- Excuse me...

35:31.277 --> 35:33.609
...if I try to get more comfortable
with you, okay?

35:34.413 --> 35:36.506
It ain't working, but okay.

35:37.316 --> 35:38.647
Now, with that in mind...

35:38.818 --> 35:42.379
...would you agree
to a consensual search of your house?

35:42.555 --> 35:44.546
Take me 40, 45 minutes
to get a warrant.

35:46.492 --> 35:48.050
What...

35:50.196 --> 35:51.458
Yes, okay.

35:55.202 --> 35:56.533
Got him.

35:57.337 --> 35:59.737
Walter Garber, right there.

36:00.240 --> 36:02.367
No shit, look at this.

36:06.078 --> 36:09.047
- Guy took a bribe, man.
- Yeah.

36:10.216 --> 36:11.240
Baby!

36:21.793 --> 36:24.455
ESU 2, this is Staley.
What's your overall status?

36:24.629 --> 36:26.096
All positions secured.

36:26.264 --> 36:28.789
<i>All right,
hold your fire until instructed.</i>

36:35.407 --> 36:37.567
Pelham 123, can you hear me?

36:38.008 --> 36:39.839
Yeah, loud and clear, back at you.

36:40.010 --> 36:42.478
All right,
the mayor has agreed to pay...

36:42.646 --> 36:45.080
...and they're getting the money
together right now.

36:45.249 --> 36:46.273
<i>Good.</i>

36:46.450 --> 36:50.112
Well, you know, you got 28 minutes,
so I advise him to make haste.

36:50.553 --> 36:53.283
- I'm sure he will.
- So is your first name Walter?

36:54.524 --> 36:56.515
- Excuse me?
- Your name, is it Walter?

36:59.062 --> 37:00.324
<i>- Yes, it is.
- Good.</i>

37:00.496 --> 37:02.293
What are you doing
dispatching trains?

37:02.465 --> 37:05.263
I thought you were some sort of
MTA big shot.

37:05.568 --> 37:09.367
I work for the MTA.
Today they put me at dispatch...

37:10.672 --> 37:11.697
...and my bad luck.

37:11.874 --> 37:13.865
I thought you didn't
believe in bad luck.

37:14.043 --> 37:16.409
I said I didn't believe in fate.

37:16.579 --> 37:19.309
Do you believe in
rigged contracts for new trains?

37:20.783 --> 37:23.775
Look, what are
we talking about this for?

37:23.953 --> 37:26.853
- I need to know who I'm dealing with.
- You need to know who...?

37:27.022 --> 37:31.118
Yeah, I want to know who I'm dealing
with. I mean, are you a bad penny?

37:31.326 --> 37:32.793
Let me explain something to you.

37:33.762 --> 37:35.730
Being accused of something
is one thing.

37:35.897 --> 37:38.525
Being guilty of it
is something entirely different.

37:38.700 --> 37:42.100
Well, agreed. But you gotta
take me through this, my man.

37:42.269 --> 37:46.035
You got to tell me from the top.
This whole train thing. Come on.

37:50.278 --> 37:52.371
All right,
I started out in maintenance.

37:52.547 --> 37:55.744
Platform maintenance,
track maintenance, flagman...

37:56.451 --> 37:58.214
<i>...conductor.
- Conductor, really?</i>

37:59.120 --> 38:01.020
Yeah. And then motorman.

38:01.188 --> 38:03.179
A motorman.
How long did you do that for?

38:03.858 --> 38:05.257
I drove them over six years.

38:05.426 --> 38:08.418
I went to tower operations,
assistant dispatcher, dispatcher.

38:08.596 --> 38:09.620
<i>I finally ended up...</i>

38:09.797 --> 38:13.460
Yeah, you're assistant chief
transportation officer or something.

38:13.634 --> 38:17.034
- Right?
- That's right.

38:17.670 --> 38:21.606
And part of my job is to go out
to the manufacturers, you know...

38:21.775 --> 38:26.337
<i>... the people who build the trains
and bid on contracts for the trains.</i>

38:26.513 --> 38:28.038
Is that where you took the bribe?

38:28.215 --> 38:30.980
The Japanese train
over the Canadian train?

38:31.153 --> 38:35.350
I did not take a bribe, all right?
I was accused of taking a bribe.

38:35.523 --> 38:37.991
I have not been proven guilty yet.

38:38.159 --> 38:40.559
They haven't said yet.
I mean, they haven't decided.

38:40.728 --> 38:45.131
Well, they got no proof. I don't care
what they decide. It doesn't matter...

38:45.299 --> 38:46.960
Then is this
when they demoted you?

38:47.134 --> 38:50.125
That's correct. They demoted me,
pending the outcome.

38:50.303 --> 38:53.067
And now they're trying
to humiliate you, is that right?

38:53.239 --> 38:54.900
Motherfuckers.

38:55.074 --> 38:57.167
<i>Look, I know
how these things work, man, okay?</i>

38:57.343 --> 38:59.607
<i>Everything doesn't seem
to appear like what it is.</i>

38:59.779 --> 39:02.111
But you've gotta be
completely honest with me, man.

39:02.282 --> 39:04.977
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- How did you do it?

39:05.150 --> 39:07.311
I didn't. I'm innocent.

39:07.486 --> 39:08.510
Oh, you're innocent.

39:08.687 --> 39:10.552
No, you're talking to a Catholic,
man.

39:10.722 --> 39:13.418
We've been over innocent before.
Okay?

39:13.592 --> 39:17.790
Look, I've been through all this, man.
So just tell me, how did you do it?

39:20.199 --> 39:22.598
I didn't do it.

39:22.767 --> 39:24.826
Okay, that's it! That's fucking it!

39:25.002 --> 39:25.670
Damn it.

39:27.405 --> 39:29.669
- Kid. You.
- Me?

39:29.841 --> 39:32.605
No, no, you. Up.
Get the fuck over there.

39:33.110 --> 39:35.169
I don't know what you did
to piss him off.

39:35.346 --> 39:37.905
Garber.
You know what I'm looking at?

39:38.348 --> 39:40.839
<i>- Do you know what I'm looking at?
- No, I do not.</i>

39:41.017 --> 39:44.282
First there's my gun, and at the end
of my gun... What's your name?

39:44.454 --> 39:47.515
- George. Everyone calls me Geo.
- George. His friends call him Geo.

39:47.692 --> 39:49.455
<i>Got this '80s skateboard thing
going.</i>

39:49.627 --> 39:53.063
He makes it work, but it's not gonna
look too good in his casket.

39:53.497 --> 39:56.432
Listen, Ryder, just slow down.
We haven't reached the deadline.

39:56.601 --> 39:58.626
No, there's no fucking deadline,
man.

39:58.803 --> 40:00.361
You just gotta tell me the truth.

40:00.538 --> 40:02.335
<i>- About what?
- The bribe!</i>

40:02.507 --> 40:04.771
- Did you take it?
- I didn't take a bribe.

40:04.943 --> 40:07.468
Okay, you got five seconds
to save this kid's life.

40:07.646 --> 40:09.443
I didn't do anything.

40:09.615 --> 40:11.343
- Five...
- Just wait a second.

40:11.515 --> 40:13.779
- Four, three...
- Wait a second!

40:13.951 --> 40:15.509
Two...

40:15.686 --> 40:18.450
- Fucking tell him how you did it.
- All right, okay.

40:23.327 --> 40:25.625
<i>- Say it.
- I took the bribe.</i>

40:27.497 --> 40:29.055
How much?

40:29.733 --> 40:31.064
Thirty...

40:31.234 --> 40:32.724
How fucking much?

40:33.870 --> 40:35.895
Thirty-five thousand dollars.

40:36.072 --> 40:37.471
How did you do it?

40:38.074 --> 40:41.009
I went to Japan
to look at these trains.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.906
It's part of my job.

40:43.079 --> 40:44.511
I...

40:44.680 --> 40:48.616
I don't get to vote, okay?
I just recommend.

40:48.784 --> 40:52.982
I chose what I thought
was the best train...

40:53.155 --> 40:56.147
...the Japanese had the best train,
and I made my recommendation.

40:56.325 --> 40:57.985
That's before you took the bribe.

40:58.626 --> 41:00.218
Yes.

41:00.395 --> 41:02.726
That was the train
you were gonna pick anyway, huh?

41:02.896 --> 41:05.832
- Yes.
- And now you're fighting for your job...

41:06.000 --> 41:07.900
...and they're trying
to humiliate you?

41:08.069 --> 41:12.335
No, no, no. I did what I did.

41:12.507 --> 41:14.338
And...

41:14.709 --> 41:17.336
And it's not, you know,
it's not the MTA's fault.

41:17.511 --> 41:19.035
What did you spend it on?

41:20.080 --> 41:22.344
Look, what does this
got to do with anything, huh?

41:22.516 --> 41:24.074
What did you fucking spend it on?

41:24.251 --> 41:27.379
I used the money for my kids,
all right?

41:27.554 --> 41:29.215
To pay my children's tuition.

41:29.389 --> 41:33.552
I have a 17-year-old.
I have a 19-year-old daughter.

41:34.126 --> 41:38.359
And I used the money to pay
for their college tuition, all right?

41:45.105 --> 41:46.402
You know what, Garber?

41:46.974 --> 41:48.737
You're my goddamn hero,
you know that?

41:48.909 --> 41:52.435
<i>You got a kid here, you don't even
know him, you saved his life.</i>

41:52.778 --> 41:56.441
That's brave, man.
That's fucking heroic.

41:57.516 --> 42:00.281
- Tell Garber thank you.
- Thank you, Garber.

42:00.454 --> 42:02.422
"Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life."

42:02.856 --> 42:04.585
Thank you, Garber,
for saving my life.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.221
You're welcome.

42:12.565 --> 42:14.055
Sit down.

42:14.867 --> 42:17.563
You're just like me, Garber.
I fueled this city.

42:17.737 --> 42:21.229
I fed it breakfast every morning,
and now we're the bad guys.

42:21.407 --> 42:24.342
I don't think so.
I don't fucking think so!

42:40.492 --> 42:42.926
<i>- Hello, Therese.
- Honey, look.</i>

42:43.094 --> 42:45.961
There are police here, Walt.
They wanna search the house.

42:46.131 --> 42:47.860
They said you said it was okay.

42:51.636 --> 42:54.036
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.
It's... Just let them in.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.164
We got nothing to hide.

42:56.607 --> 42:58.131
Is this about the investigation?

42:58.809 --> 43:00.970
No, no. You watching TV?

43:01.345 --> 43:03.540
This hostage thing.
Yeah, yeah, I'm watching it.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.106
Well, it's just that...

43:06.316 --> 43:08.181
I'll tell you about it
when I get home...

43:08.352 --> 43:11.845
...but I'm in the middle of it now and
they wanna do background checks...

43:12.023 --> 43:14.013
...on everybody involved here
from the MTA.

43:14.191 --> 43:17.752
- That's why they're at the house.
- All right, okay. But you're okay?

43:17.928 --> 43:21.056
I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let them in.
I'll see you when I get home.

43:21.231 --> 43:23.722
All right. Okay, bye.

43:23.901 --> 43:25.027
I'm sorry, Walter.

43:26.003 --> 43:27.436
I am.

43:27.604 --> 43:30.800
Listen, don't let this guy
bring you into his reality, all right?

43:30.973 --> 43:33.737
That's what he wants to do.
He hurts you, you get angry.

43:33.910 --> 43:36.105
- He's got the advantage. Understand?
- Yeah.

43:36.279 --> 43:38.304
Just deflect, if you can.

43:39.148 --> 43:41.344
- Okay? All right.
- All right.

44:08.111 --> 44:09.738
I hope they don't get fucking lost.

44:16.018 --> 44:17.849
Fuck me! Ten-million bucks.

44:20.455 --> 44:22.685
The joke is,
say we dipped in, took some?

44:22.858 --> 44:25.793
Bad guys would count it,
come up short, probably kill us.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.525
No shit.

44:39.140 --> 44:40.767
Geo, what the fuck's happening?

44:43.544 --> 44:46.673
<i>Geo. Geo, what's going on?</i>

44:49.017 --> 44:50.644
Geo.

44:52.253 --> 44:54.380
I'm a fucking hostage.

44:56.624 --> 45:00.857
Listen to me.
Stream it on our site. Call the news.

45:01.296 --> 45:02.923
<i>Shit.</i>

45:08.902 --> 45:10.335
Hey.

45:14.440 --> 45:17.773
We've gotta do something.
They're gonna kill us.

45:21.481 --> 45:22.573
You got a plan?

45:23.283 --> 45:24.648
I thought you'd have one.

45:31.924 --> 45:33.824
Because I'm some
tough-looking black guy?

45:34.927 --> 45:37.487
I saw that ring on your finger.

45:43.301 --> 45:44.791
That was a long time ago.

45:44.969 --> 45:47.597
- Okay?
- My husband had one just like it.

45:54.512 --> 45:55.843
<i>A severe sell-off underway...</i>

45:56.013 --> 45:59.277
<i>... the Dow is down 450 points
in very heavy trading...</i>

45:59.449 --> 46:01.781
<i>... as Wall Street reacts
to the terrorist attack...</i>

46:01.952 --> 46:04.887
<i>... of the New York City
subway system.</i>

46:11.762 --> 46:15.128
- How's my hair look?
- Fine. You ready to make a statement?

46:15.298 --> 46:17.324
When I have something to tell them.

46:17.501 --> 46:19.128
It's a leadership moment, sir.

46:19.303 --> 46:22.137
I'm not running for re-election,
for fucking president.

46:22.307 --> 46:24.537
I left my Rudy Giuliani suit at home.

46:24.710 --> 46:28.043
You're being selfish.
It'll take 30 seconds to reassure them.

46:35.519 --> 46:36.577
- Over there!
- Mr. Mayor!

46:36.754 --> 46:40.019
- Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor!
- Will you be making a statement?

46:40.191 --> 46:43.217
We're doing everything
the situation demands.

46:43.394 --> 46:46.261
I'm not gonna speculate right now.
All right?

46:46.430 --> 46:48.590
- Mayor, is it terrorism?
- No.

46:49.032 --> 46:50.624
Hey.

46:50.800 --> 46:52.700
Mayor! Are they terrorists?

46:52.869 --> 46:55.167
All right, all right, all right!

46:55.338 --> 46:57.465
Listen, nobody said anything
about terrorism...

46:57.641 --> 47:00.940
...or a bomb, anything like that.
Let's stop that right now, all right?

47:01.111 --> 47:03.875
How about your divorce? Care
to speculate how that's going?

47:04.047 --> 47:05.172
Your divorce, sir.

47:05.347 --> 47:07.247
Been a lot of talk in the news
lately...

47:07.416 --> 47:11.284
...that you have extramarital problems.
Your divorce, sir!

47:13.022 --> 47:14.717
Put it on channel 15.

47:14.890 --> 47:18.155
We got a girl in Brooklyn watching it
on her boyfriend's computer.

47:18.327 --> 47:20.386
- It's on the damn Internet.
- What?

47:22.797 --> 47:24.458
Hold on.

47:25.466 --> 47:27.331
- Son of a bitch.
- That's Ramos, isn't it?

47:27.502 --> 47:28.594
That's Phil Ramos.

47:28.770 --> 47:30.203
- Yes, it is.
- Who's Phil Ramos?

47:30.371 --> 47:34.102
He was a motorman. He killed a
couple of passengers 10 years ago?

47:34.275 --> 47:38.075
High on cough syrup, ran into the
platform, went to jail for manslaughter.

47:38.246 --> 47:39.907
Phil Ramos, I want everything.

47:40.081 --> 47:43.448
Prison time, known associates, the
works. Looks like it's from the floor.

47:43.618 --> 47:46.280
- Should the Internet be working there?
- No. No way.

47:46.454 --> 47:48.922
Maybe that's how he knows about you.
He Googled you.

47:49.090 --> 47:50.751
Or maybe Ramos told him,
who knows?

47:54.128 --> 47:56.995
Goddamn, it's the mayor.
Hello, Your Honor.

48:00.268 --> 48:02.463
Do me a favor,
forget about those guys.

48:02.637 --> 48:03.729
Easy for you to say.

48:03.905 --> 48:05.600
You rather be
one of those hostages?

48:05.773 --> 48:06.865
No.

48:07.041 --> 48:10.135
Listen up, I'll give you a crash course
on hostage negotiating.

48:10.311 --> 48:11.971
We're like rodeo clowns.

48:12.145 --> 48:15.673
We keep the bull from focusing on
what he'd like to do. Which is what?

48:15.850 --> 48:17.181
- Kill a cowboy.
- Exactly.

48:17.352 --> 48:19.820
Now, he's got his deadline.
You slow things down.

48:19.987 --> 48:23.855
Preservation of life. That's our mission.
Guy's already proven he's serious.

48:24.025 --> 48:26.084
Next deadline's gonna give
a chance again.

48:26.260 --> 48:29.023
- How do we deal with that?
- Get the money there on time.

48:29.196 --> 48:31.630
If we don't, we pretend
the deadline doesn't exist...

48:31.798 --> 48:33.925
...talk through it, we buy time,
get movement.

48:34.101 --> 48:35.466
- Movement?
- That's right.

48:35.635 --> 48:39.469
Contradicts himself, inconsistency in
his demand, you got some movement.

48:39.639 --> 48:43.200
- Right.
- All right, let's go out there.

48:45.845 --> 48:47.312
<i>This was the scene
moments ago...</i>

48:47.480 --> 48:49.812
<i>... outside the Rail Control Center
in Midtown.</i>

48:49.982 --> 48:52.212
<i>I'm not gonna speculate right now.</i>

48:52.385 --> 48:54.650
That is a beautiful suit
he's got there.

48:57.691 --> 49:00.659
Can't get it out of my head.
I'm gonna die today.

49:01.827 --> 49:06.662
Visualization's a very powerful thing.
You keep thinking it, you never know.

49:19.643 --> 49:22.407
Please let it be me
who drops this motherfucker.

49:29.086 --> 49:31.146
Hey, Garber. You there, buddy?

49:33.324 --> 49:34.722
Yeah, I'm here.

49:34.892 --> 49:37.087
<i>A little birdie told me
the mayor walked in.</i>

49:37.261 --> 49:38.558
Can I talk to him?

49:41.398 --> 49:43.764
<i>- Can he hear me?
- How does he know I'm here?</i>

49:45.335 --> 49:47.599
- Does he have a camera in here?
- Can he hear me?

49:47.771 --> 49:51.831
We can, we can, we can...
We can all hear you here. Yes.

49:52.008 --> 49:56.707
Okay, good. So tell him...
Tell him I wanna make him a deal.

49:57.480 --> 49:59.744
<i>Tell him I'll make him a deal
right now.</i>

49:59.916 --> 50:01.508
Okay, all right.

50:01.684 --> 50:03.276
Well, come on, speak up,
Mr. Mayor.

50:03.453 --> 50:05.250
You're talking to your constituents.

50:05.421 --> 50:08.912
We got a train full
of registered voters. Don't you care?

50:09.090 --> 50:11.685
Don't you care about your voters?

50:13.329 --> 50:16.389
This is not a good idea.
Don't talk. Don't engage with him.

50:16.566 --> 50:19.228
I know what I'm doing,
I've been doing this a long time.

50:19.403 --> 50:20.597
<i>Come on, buddy, speak up.</i>

50:20.771 --> 50:23.466
You gotta hit the blue button there,
Your Honor.

50:25.107 --> 50:26.472
Yes, this is the mayor.

50:26.909 --> 50:29.139
Hey. Good to meet you, man.

50:29.312 --> 50:31.712
And listen, tell me this, is this true?

50:31.881 --> 50:33.212
I read that you make, like...

50:33.382 --> 50:37.011
<i>... one dollar a year to be a mayor
of New York, is that true?</i>

50:37.186 --> 50:39.484
Yes, but at least it's honest work.

50:39.655 --> 50:43.249
After taxes that's, like,
87 cents, isn't it?

50:43.425 --> 50:44.449
Yes.

50:44.626 --> 50:45.991
Don't bullshit me, man.

50:46.161 --> 50:50.291
It would take, like, 3000 years
to pay off that suit that you're wearing.

50:50.465 --> 50:53.366
What do you got, 20, 30 million
dollars or something like that?

50:53.535 --> 50:56.436
You don't get that without screwing
someone, screwing everyone.

50:56.604 --> 50:58.731
I'm sure your wife knows
something about that.

51:03.577 --> 51:05.102
You said you had a deal for me.

51:05.280 --> 51:07.111
Yeah, I do.
I wanna make you a deal.

51:07.282 --> 51:09.409
I wanna tell you
you could come down here...

51:09.584 --> 51:13.610
...and I will trade you for all these
passengers in the train, how's that?

51:17.458 --> 51:21.519
Okay, you could save the lives
of 17 New Yorkers.

51:21.695 --> 51:23.595
Now, that's a good deal.

51:26.233 --> 51:27.461
<i>What do you think?</i>

51:31.972 --> 51:33.462
Give us a moment.

51:33.641 --> 51:35.370
Okay.

51:35.809 --> 51:37.777
I'll give you a moment.

51:40.114 --> 51:42.742
You turn this into a circus,
gonna get someone killed.

51:42.917 --> 51:45.477
Now, you entered his world, exit it.

51:50.857 --> 51:54.418
Okay, time's up. What's the deal?

51:54.694 --> 51:57.458
It's a nice offer, but I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to decline.

51:57.630 --> 52:00.690
Good. Because if you begged me,
I wouldn't give you that deal, man.

52:00.867 --> 52:03.664
You think anyone cares about
a philandering asshole like you?

52:03.835 --> 52:06.827
New York would love me to
pull the fucking trigger on you.

52:07.005 --> 52:10.566
Hey, Garber. This is the... This is
the guy that's trying to get rid of you.

52:10.742 --> 52:12.676
- Keep talking.
- Do you believe this shit?

52:12.844 --> 52:14.539
<i>- Calm...
- You don't think he...</i>

52:14.713 --> 52:16.180
...broke the same rules
we broke?

52:16.348 --> 52:18.179
- He knows it, I know it.
- Calm him down.

52:18.350 --> 52:19.873
<i>- All right...
- He can eat shit.</i>

52:20.051 --> 52:21.484
- Calm him down.
- You're...

52:21.652 --> 52:23.517
<i>- You're breaking up.
- He can kiss my ass!</i>

52:23.688 --> 52:25.714
I like the deal.
It's a good deal, but...

52:25.891 --> 52:27.222
<i>Fuck you, Mr. Mayor!</i>

52:27.392 --> 52:31.021
Now, I want my fucking money now!
You understand me? Now!

52:31.196 --> 52:34.131
- Just tell him the money's on the way.
- The money's on the way.

52:34.299 --> 52:36.823
Because he's, like,
a used-car salesman, this asshole.

52:37.001 --> 52:39.368
He can lick my bunghole,
motherfucker!

52:40.205 --> 52:42.730
One mistake
and everyone has something to say.

52:43.442 --> 52:44.704
Was she worth it?

52:44.876 --> 52:48.608
Yes. You have nine minutes.
How are you gonna get the money?

52:48.781 --> 52:52.046
They're shutting down every
intersection here to Brooklyn.

53:00.225 --> 53:02.090
Phil Ramos, male, Hispanic, 39.

53:02.260 --> 53:04.421
Sentenced two to four years
for manslaughter...

53:04.596 --> 53:06.564
...paroled last month from Clinton.

53:06.732 --> 53:09.928
His PO, Justafarro, says he's
living in a halfway house in Queens.

53:10.101 --> 53:13.468
He's not an absconder, he made his
appearances, his piss has been clean.

53:13.638 --> 53:16.630
But he was a no-show at work today.
He didn't call in, nothing.

53:16.807 --> 53:18.638
He knows the system.

53:18.809 --> 53:21.073
The perfect place in the subway
to stop the train.

53:21.245 --> 53:23.975
He's been out a month.
This wasn't planned in three weeks.

53:24.148 --> 53:27.172
Find out Ramos's cellmates,
who worked in the laundry with him.

53:27.349 --> 53:29.647
Call lists, visitors lists ASAP.

53:41.730 --> 53:42.889
<i>105 North Avenue.</i>

53:53.508 --> 53:54.634
- Shit! Look out!
- Shit!

54:05.452 --> 54:07.353
<i>The market has tumbled
nearly 7 percent...</i>

54:07.522 --> 54:09.581
<i>... as investors continue
to react to events...</i>

54:09.757 --> 54:11.156
They just came off the bridge.

54:11.325 --> 54:14.352
Why didn't we send
a helicopter for the money?

54:16.264 --> 54:19.131
Now remember what I said
about talking through deadlines.

54:19.300 --> 54:22.929
We better have a plan B in case
the money isn't there on the dot.

54:23.104 --> 54:24.901
Put him on his heels.
He knows things.

54:25.073 --> 54:26.938
- We know things too, right?
- Right.

54:27.108 --> 54:30.135
Ask him about Phil Ramos. All right?
Just get him talking.

54:30.312 --> 54:31.336
You can do it.

54:35.516 --> 54:37.450
- Hey, Ryder.
- The money here yet?

54:37.618 --> 54:38.642
<i>On the way.</i>

54:38.820 --> 54:40.981
Then what the fuck
are you calling me for?

54:41.155 --> 54:43.055
Actually, I just called to talk.

54:44.192 --> 54:46.353
<i>Oh, yeah?
What do you wanna talk about?</i>

54:47.128 --> 54:50.392
You said that
being in the motorman's cab...

54:50.564 --> 54:52.964
...was a little like
being in a confessional, right?

54:53.133 --> 54:54.157
Yeah?

54:54.334 --> 54:57.167
I was thinking maybe it's like
being in a prison cell too.

54:57.337 --> 55:00.829
What are you trying to say? That
if I get caught, I'd better get used to it?

55:01.007 --> 55:03.703
No, I'm just wondering.
Maybe you're already used to it.

55:03.877 --> 55:08.438
I'm wondering maybe that's how
you meet a guy like Phil Ramos?

55:08.614 --> 55:10.241
How the fuck he know that?

55:10.416 --> 55:12.441
Why don't you tell me?
Then we'll both know.

55:12.618 --> 55:13.915
After today's confession...

55:14.086 --> 55:16.077
<i>... you're gonna find your ass
in prison too.</i>

55:16.255 --> 55:18.917
Which is my point. I want you
to hook me up on the inside.

55:19.091 --> 55:22.218
You know everybody. This way,
when I come up with my heist plan...

55:22.393 --> 55:24.362
...you know, I'll cut you in.

55:24.530 --> 55:27.158
I can see I've inspired you.
Okay, I got a story for you.

55:27.333 --> 55:30.302
<i>It might help you in prison.
You wanna hear it? We got a minute.</i>

55:30.469 --> 55:31.936
I'd like to hear a little story.

55:32.104 --> 55:34.698
<i>So back in the day,
when I was a high roller...</i>

55:34.874 --> 55:36.398
When were you ever a high roller?

55:38.042 --> 55:40.033
<i>I told you I fed this city breakfast.</i>

55:40.211 --> 55:41.235
Grits and eggs?

55:41.412 --> 55:43.539
Something like that.
Anyway, back in the day...

55:43.715 --> 55:46.115
...I took this chick to Iceland.

55:46.417 --> 55:48.886
Iceland? Is that where
all the high rollers go?

55:49.054 --> 55:52.114
Six hours from Kennedy
and the nightclub scene is...

55:52.291 --> 55:53.519
...you know, is intense.

55:53.692 --> 55:55.556
<i>I thought I'd take this chick
to Iceland.</i>

55:55.727 --> 55:57.126
<i>- What's her name?
- Ludvika.</i>

55:57.295 --> 56:00.264
She was Lithuanian.
She was an ass model.

56:01.099 --> 56:02.123
She asked you what?

56:02.600 --> 56:04.033
You heard of hand models?

56:04.202 --> 56:06.602
<i>Advertisement?
Right, she was an ass model.</i>

56:06.771 --> 56:10.138
She did jeans and, you know,
magazines and shit.

56:10.308 --> 56:12.468
Anyway,
it was Fashion Week in New York...

56:12.643 --> 56:14.611
...and I took her to Iceland.

56:14.778 --> 56:18.976
Ludvika, Lithuanian, ass model,
Iceland, you took her to the ice.

56:19.149 --> 56:20.616
<i>- So what?
- Well, for 500 bucks...</i>

56:20.784 --> 56:23.275
<i>... they'll take you on a dogsled ride
on a glacier.</i>

56:23.453 --> 56:26.123
<i>- Dogsled?
- Yeah. And you know the old saying:</i>

56:26.124 --> 56:27.324
<i>If you're not the lead dog...</i>

56:27.724 --> 56:29.824
<i>...the view never changes?
- Right.</i>

56:29.825 --> 56:33.782
Otherwise, you're always looking at
the asshole of the dog in front of you.

56:33.783 --> 56:35.884
<i>Be funny in a minute
when I get to that part.</i>

56:35.885 --> 56:37.085
It's funny now.

56:54.186 --> 56:56.786
And it's 8 in the morning,
we haven't been to bed yet...

56:56.986 --> 56:58.987
<i>... and we're tooling across
this glacier...</i>

56:59.087 --> 57:02.386
<i>... and I got this hangover that's
creeping up the back of my neck...</i>

57:02.587 --> 57:04.587
...and guess what I'm looking at?

57:04.787 --> 57:08.187
Obviously you're staring at the ass
of the dog in front of you.

57:08.287 --> 57:09.387
You got it.

57:09.486 --> 57:12.387
So this dog, out of nowhere,
just lifts its hind legs up...

57:12.587 --> 57:14.687
...and puts them in
the harness there...

57:14.887 --> 57:18.088
<i>... and just takes a shit
while he's running on his front paws.</i>

57:18.287 --> 57:20.588
So he's dumping
and running all at the same time.

57:20.688 --> 57:22.988
Now, that's multi-fucking-tasking
if you ask me.

57:23.189 --> 57:24.989
Get out of here. Did it hit you?

57:25.390 --> 57:26.790
Shit always hits you, man.

57:39.889 --> 57:42.389
I didn't know it at the time,
but it was profound.

57:42.489 --> 57:44.589
<i>- Profound? You lost me.
- Yeah.</i>

57:44.689 --> 57:48.690
Well, you know, when I went to
prison later on, which you called...

57:48.889 --> 57:51.490
...I had trouble going to the toilet.

57:51.590 --> 57:53.090
<i>You know, a privacy thing.</i>

57:53.890 --> 57:58.891
<i>And I couldn't take a shit.
I was scared shitless, literally.</i>

57:59.491 --> 58:01.092
So you know what I thought of?

58:01.292 --> 58:03.692
<i>- You thought of the dog.
- That's right.</i>

58:03.792 --> 58:07.692
<i>I thought if that dog could do
what it needed to do, so could I.</i>

58:08.291 --> 58:09.692
Saved my fucking life.

58:10.992 --> 58:12.692
Wow, that is profound.

58:12.892 --> 58:14.192
Keep going.

58:14.693 --> 58:16.992
And, you know, it's...

58:17.092 --> 58:19.793
People adapt. It's like you and I,
like today.

58:19.893 --> 58:21.693
We didn't know how it
was gonna start.

58:21.793 --> 58:23.393
<i>- Wrong.
- Wrong what?</i>

58:23.493 --> 58:25.393
I knew exactly
how it was gonna start.

58:25.593 --> 58:28.094
Yeah, but do you know
how it's gonna end?

58:29.594 --> 58:32.094
- I'm tired of talking to you, Garber.
- Wait a minute.

58:32.294 --> 58:34.694
Call me when the money comes in.
You got four minutes.

58:37.594 --> 58:39.894
I don't know what he looks like,
but he sounds good.

58:40.095 --> 58:42.095
Fucking talk shit,
what are you doing?

58:42.295 --> 58:44.895
He's got a sexy voice though.
He'd be my bitch in prison.

58:45.096 --> 58:46.496
Where are we?

58:46.596 --> 58:49.196
Less than 10 blocks away.
We'll make it.

58:57.396 --> 58:58.598
Fuck, look out!

59:16.199 --> 59:17.899
Jesus.

59:21.400 --> 59:24.601
Shit. The goddamn money car
crashed on 1 st Avenue.

59:24.801 --> 59:27.601
Get a radio car,
put it on the motorcycles, get it there.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.601
Watch it. Easy.

59:31.101 --> 59:32.601
Here, lean up here.

59:32.801 --> 59:34.301
Hey, get that last bag.

59:59.503 --> 01:00:02.003
- You got 22 seconds, Garber.
- All right, we just had...

01:00:02.203 --> 01:00:06.002
...a little problem over here, that's all.
- I don't care.

01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:14.903
- Two minutes.
- Just tell him it's here.

01:00:15.003 --> 01:00:17.503
- How's he gonna know?
- I don't think we should lie.

01:00:17.604 --> 01:00:19.804
- Tell him the truth.
- No, tell him it's there.

01:00:19.904 --> 01:00:21.004
Tell him the truth?

01:00:21.904 --> 01:00:23.105
He's gonna make me do it.

01:00:34.306 --> 01:00:38.307
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...
- Tell him the truth or lie?

01:00:38.507 --> 01:00:40.508
- Tell him the truth.
- Tell him it's there.

01:00:40.708 --> 01:00:42.707
- Four, three...
- Tell him it's here.

01:00:42.907 --> 01:00:44.409
- It's here.
- Two, one.

01:00:44.609 --> 01:00:47.209
The money's there,
it's at 42nd and Vanderbilt.

01:00:50.509 --> 01:00:53.510
Liar! Motherfucking liar!

01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.910
Seven.

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:59.310
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
- Ryder. All right, listen.

01:00:59.411 --> 01:01:01.210
<i>- Lucky lady, up.
- We made a mistake.</i>

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.710
<i>- I think that's him. That's Ryder.
- Lucky lady, up.</i>

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:06.210
- Listen to me, it was an accident.
- Keep talking.

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.411
Ryder, we made a mistake.
It's my fault.

01:01:08.610 --> 01:01:10.310
- The car crashed.
- Tell him something!

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:12.311
- That's why the money's not there.
- Up!

01:01:13.811 --> 01:01:14.911
- Up!
- Wait.

01:01:15.211 --> 01:01:16.911
- Fuck, no.
- Get up!

01:01:17.111 --> 01:01:18.512
Get back in line!

01:01:18.711 --> 01:01:20.511
Ryder, like one minute
it's gonna take.

01:01:25.512 --> 01:01:27.912
<i>Don't do this, for God's sake.
It was an accident.</i>

01:01:28.012 --> 01:01:29.212
- Come on.
- Wait.

01:01:29.412 --> 01:01:30.612
It's the only plan I got.

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:32.412
Ryder, listen, it was an accident.

01:01:32.612 --> 01:01:35.512
It was an accident, Ryder.
We made a mistake.

01:01:35.712 --> 01:01:38.212
It was an accident, Ryder!
It was an accident!

01:01:38.412 --> 01:01:39.812
Come on, motherfucker!

01:01:40.513 --> 01:01:42.112
Oh, shit.

01:01:43.813 --> 01:01:45.013
God!

01:01:46.013 --> 01:01:47.312
Oh, my God.

01:01:53.413 --> 01:01:56.614
ESU Team 1 to Sniper 1,
do you have a shot?

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.814
That's your fault.

01:02:05.114 --> 01:02:06.914
I got an easy shot. Please advise.

01:02:07.816 --> 01:02:09.715
<i>- Stand by.
- Roger that.</i>

01:02:21.616 --> 01:02:22.816
Shit!

01:02:40.018 --> 01:02:41.218
What the fuck happened?

01:02:42.618 --> 01:02:45.718
Accidental discharge.
I just got bit by a fucking rat.

01:02:46.118 --> 01:02:47.319
It's accidental discharge.

01:02:47.519 --> 01:02:49.920
Who? Who got shot? Was it Ryder?

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:51.320
No, it was Ramos.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.320
- Sergeant? The money there yet?
- What? Yes, yes.

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.221
<i>- Are you there?
- Get in here.</i>

01:03:06.321 --> 01:03:08.620
Shoot any motherfucker that moves.

01:03:09.221 --> 01:03:11.020
- That's an order!
- Shit on your orders.

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:12.322
<i>Can you hear me, Ryder?</i>

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.222
Okay,
now somebody else has to die.

01:03:16.323 --> 01:03:17.723
Two people, maybe all of us.

01:03:21.523 --> 01:03:22.623
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

01:03:22.723 --> 01:03:25.424
I heard you, but you gotta understand,
the circumstances...

01:03:25.623 --> 01:03:27.223
...they're different now for you.

01:03:27.423 --> 01:03:28.522
<i>- You gotta rethink.
- No.</i>

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:29.823
You got to adapt.

01:03:30.022 --> 01:03:33.023
No, I gave you instructions,
and you know the consequences!

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:34.723
I mean, don't you have a plan B?

01:03:34.823 --> 01:03:36.824
No, plan B is enforcing plan A!

01:03:37.024 --> 01:03:40.223
And the minute you stop believing me,
motherfucker, that's it!

01:03:40.324 --> 01:03:43.125
I believe you, you gotta believe
and understand those cops...

01:03:43.325 --> 01:03:45.726
...are gonna be down
and next to you any second...

01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:48.526
Bring it, man! Let them
unload their guns, I don't care!

01:03:48.726 --> 01:03:50.926
And what's the point of that?
What's the point?

01:03:51.126 --> 01:03:53.526
I told you we all owe God a death.

01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:56.626
And now it's two minutes
past the deadline, two minutes.

01:03:56.826 --> 01:04:00.026
Which means two people,
almost three, have to go.

01:04:00.226 --> 01:04:01.526
They have to die.

01:04:04.226 --> 01:04:06.426
The money's there, Ryder.
Nobody else has to die.

01:04:06.626 --> 01:04:07.627
<i>The money's there.</i>

01:04:07.826 --> 01:04:12.127
<i>I don't know what you owe God. I can
tell you, you can't pay him in cash.</i>

01:04:14.127 --> 01:04:16.428
You never see a U-Haul
behind a hearse, Ryder.

01:04:16.627 --> 01:04:20.128
<i>The Egyptians tried it. It doesn't work.
You can't take the money with you.</i>

01:04:21.828 --> 01:04:23.228
<i>Ryder?</i>

01:04:24.028 --> 01:04:25.628
<i>You can't take the money with you.</i>

01:04:26.328 --> 01:04:30.229
All this talk of God,
I think I need to pray.

01:04:30.429 --> 01:04:32.129
Give me a minute.

01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:36.430
I can do that.

01:04:42.531 --> 01:04:43.931
You did good, Walter.

01:04:48.031 --> 01:04:50.131
What's the reality of getting in,
ending this?

01:04:50.331 --> 01:04:52.632
We'd have to be willing to accept
heavy casualties.

01:04:52.832 --> 01:04:54.732
It's a hard choice, but I say make it.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:59.032
New York City does not have
an acceptable casualty rate.

01:04:59.232 --> 01:05:01.132
This is your area,
what do you suggest?

01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:04.533
We should buy time. So far this
son of a bitch hasn't allowed us to.

01:05:04.632 --> 01:05:06.833
This might be the first time
we got through.

01:05:06.933 --> 01:05:09.533
Trust your man? He confessed
to a felony 20 minutes ago.

01:05:09.733 --> 01:05:12.834
There are people down there
who are alive because of him.

01:05:13.034 --> 01:05:15.033
Until we change the rules
or hope runs out...

01:05:15.233 --> 01:05:18.035
...we should stick with the situation
we have now.

01:05:19.435 --> 01:05:20.835
Do what you need to do.

01:05:32.235 --> 01:05:33.835
Hey, Garber, you there?

01:05:34.436 --> 01:05:36.536
<i>- Yeah, I'm here.
- Speak up.</i>

01:05:36.635 --> 01:05:38.336
I'm here.

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:41.636
<i>- I talked to God.
- That's good. What did he say?</i>

01:05:41.836 --> 01:05:44.537
He said I should trust in him.
All others, pay cash.

01:05:44.737 --> 01:05:46.936
How soon can you get it down here?

01:05:48.338 --> 01:05:51.738
From that station, it would take them
about five minutes to walk it down.

01:05:51.938 --> 01:05:54.137
<i>- No can do.
- About 10 minutes to walk it down.</i>

01:05:54.337 --> 01:05:55.637
No, no, no, I mean you, man.

01:05:55.837 --> 01:05:57.937
How long would it take you
to come down here?

01:05:59.037 --> 01:06:00.637
Don't understand.
What do you mean?

01:06:00.737 --> 01:06:02.338
I mean you. I wanna meet you.

01:06:02.538 --> 01:06:05.638
And if you bring it,
I know the cops aren't bringing it.

01:06:06.538 --> 01:06:09.338
Well, you know, I don't know
how I'm gonna carry that money.

01:06:09.538 --> 01:06:11.938
- It must weigh...
- Two-hundred and twenty pounds.

01:06:12.138 --> 01:06:13.839
Stick it in a wheelbarrow
or something.

01:06:14.039 --> 01:06:16.339
Why are we discussing weight?
Shouldn't you think:

01:06:16.539 --> 01:06:19.639
- "Get the fuck out of there"?
- Okay, get the fuck out of there.

01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:22.739
Good, that's progress.
Now, look, plan B. Your idea.

01:06:22.939 --> 01:06:26.238
And part of plan B is you, Garber,
deliver that money...

01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:29.239
...or I kill another hostage,
you got that?

01:06:32.639 --> 01:06:35.139
You got seven minutes, buddy boy.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:46.141
You got six minutes and 55 seconds,
check me.

01:06:48.041 --> 01:06:49.142
Do it!

01:06:50.942 --> 01:06:51.942
I check.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:56.142
And tell that sleazebag negotiator
to call me when you've got the money.

01:06:59.843 --> 01:07:01.543
You don't have to do this.

01:07:26.646 --> 01:07:29.747
Finally somebody got their head
out of their ass, huh?

01:07:34.947 --> 01:07:35.947
Hello?

01:07:36.147 --> 01:07:38.447
Hey, how you doing, baby?
What are you doing?

01:07:39.447 --> 01:07:42.948
What do you mean, what am I doing?
I'm watching the thing, the hostages.

01:07:43.148 --> 01:07:46.448
They mentioned you. They said a
dispatcher was talking to the terrorists.

01:07:46.648 --> 01:07:48.548
Yeah, yeah, they're not terrorists.

01:07:48.949 --> 01:07:51.047
They are if they're down there
waving guns.

01:07:51.147 --> 01:07:53.548
Right, right.
Listen, Therese, are you listening?

01:07:53.748 --> 01:07:57.248
- I'm listening.
- Look, I'm the one that...

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:00.149
You're right. I was the one
that's been talking to them.

01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:04.049
I knew it. I am so proud of you.

01:08:04.249 --> 01:08:06.749
After everything, all this,
them trying to fire you.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:09.050
<i>Them sticking you
in a dispatch job and you...</i>

01:08:10.049 --> 01:08:11.249
Where are you?

01:08:11.449 --> 01:08:13.550
I'm at a heliport.

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:15.750
I'm getting ready
to get on a helicopter...

01:08:15.850 --> 01:08:20.049
...because they want me to take
the money down to the tunnel.

01:08:20.249 --> 01:08:23.450
What? Are they crazy?

01:08:23.649 --> 01:08:26.352
- It's real simple. There's nothing to it.
- Over there.

01:08:26.452 --> 01:08:30.152
What it is, is he knows I'm not a cop,
so he wants me to come down...

01:08:30.352 --> 01:08:32.553
Is it all right if I wait here?
Can I wait here?

01:08:32.752 --> 01:08:36.053
They need me to take the money down
because they know I'm not a cop...

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:40.054
...and, you know, they're saying
that he might kill somebody, honey.

01:08:40.252 --> 01:08:43.254
Well, then somebody has to die,
because you can't.

01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:44.854
He's talking to his wife.

01:08:45.054 --> 01:08:47.255
I understand, baby.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:49.353
- Just tell Angela at the meet...
- Let's go!

01:08:49.554 --> 01:08:51.054
When she runs over the hurdles.

01:08:51.254 --> 01:08:53.354
Tell her to run straight through
the hurdles.

01:08:53.453 --> 01:08:56.854
- Just like I always tell her, okay?
- Come on, we gotta go.

01:08:57.054 --> 01:08:59.154
You tell her yourself.

01:08:59.254 --> 01:09:01.354
<i>- Now, you listen to me.
- Yeah, I'm listening.</i>

01:09:01.555 --> 01:09:04.957
Now, you do what you have to do,
but we need milk.

01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:07.457
So on your way home,
I want you to bring a gallon.

01:09:07.657 --> 01:09:09.957
Of milk? Okay.

01:09:10.157 --> 01:09:11.557
You promise.

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:14.157
Why do we...? Why a gallon?
Why not a half a gallon?

01:09:14.357 --> 01:09:17.057
Just bring a gallon. A gallon.

01:09:17.557 --> 01:09:19.557
Okay. Okay.

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:23.057
I can get a half a gallon,
I'll get a half a gallon.

01:09:23.657 --> 01:09:24.857
I gotta go.

01:09:28.756 --> 01:09:30.258
All right, thanks, guys.

01:09:45.859 --> 01:09:48.359
Put your... Put your headset on.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:03.962
You ever do anything like this before?
You know, go in unarmed?

01:10:04.162 --> 01:10:06.162
Yeah. Two years ago, Brooklyn.

01:10:06.361 --> 01:10:10.062
Flatbush Avenue.
I got the hostages out.

01:10:12.862 --> 01:10:14.062
And the guy with the gun?

01:10:15.562 --> 01:10:18.462
The guy with the gun,
didn't end well for him.

01:10:18.862 --> 01:10:21.462
- For the guy with the gun?
- Yeah.

01:10:27.263 --> 01:10:30.063
It's nice seeing it
from this perspective, huh?

01:10:30.964 --> 01:10:33.063
You can see what you're fighting for.

01:10:48.364 --> 01:10:50.664
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:10:53.965 --> 01:10:55.065
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:57.565
Yeah.

01:11:01.666 --> 01:11:03.867
<i>Well, do you love me back?</i>

01:11:04.367 --> 01:11:06.667
<i>Can't really talk right now.</i>

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.568
<i>All you have to say is "Yes."</i>

01:11:14.668 --> 01:11:17.168
<i>That's a lot less words than saying,
"I can't talk."</i>

01:11:22.568 --> 01:11:25.669
<i>I'm having a really weird
fucking day.</i>

01:11:28.569 --> 01:11:30.670
Oh, God.

01:11:30.869 --> 01:11:34.270
If we'd anticipated this,
we could have made a lot of money.

01:11:38.271 --> 01:11:39.871
What kind of guy
would you expect...

01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:42.272
...to take a model to Iceland
for the weekend?

01:11:42.372 --> 01:11:44.270
- An ass model.
- An ass model.

01:11:45.570 --> 01:11:47.771
- A Wall Street guy.
- A Wall Street guy.

01:11:55.472 --> 01:11:57.072
He's here!

01:11:57.572 --> 01:11:59.972
<i>The one-hour time limit
reported earlier has expired.</i>

01:12:00.172 --> 01:12:04.673
<i>We're not sure who this is. It could
be hostage negotiators or detectives.</i>

01:12:04.873 --> 01:12:07.373
<i>Once we have any updates,
we'll be back to you live.</i>

01:12:14.772 --> 01:12:15.972
- Camonetti.
- How are you?

01:12:16.173 --> 01:12:18.273
- Mr. Garber, Lieutenant Staley.
- Pleasure.

01:12:18.474 --> 01:12:21.074
- You got a radio set up to the train?
- Set up right there.

01:12:21.275 --> 01:12:23.574
You can talk to the train
or to Rail Control.

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:27.175
Okay. Just do what he says,
and remember everything you see.

01:12:27.375 --> 01:12:28.776
Let's go.

01:12:31.075 --> 01:12:33.176
So who the hell did you fuck
to get this job?

01:12:33.276 --> 01:12:35.776
Myself. It was easier than it looked.

01:12:35.976 --> 01:12:38.676
Yeah, fucking yourself always is.

01:12:42.076 --> 01:12:45.576
<i>Pelham 123, come in.
Pelham 123, come in.</i>

01:12:45.676 --> 01:12:46.876
Who am I talking to?

01:12:46.976 --> 01:12:50.076
This is Lieutenant Camonetti.
We spoke earlier.

01:12:50.277 --> 01:12:53.377
Yeah, you're the greaseball.
What'd you do, go out for a pizza?

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.377
<i>What's my money doing, man?
Where is it?</i>

01:12:55.577 --> 01:12:59.378
Mr. Garber is in the tunnel.
The money is two minutes away.

01:12:59.578 --> 01:13:01.577
Oh, Garber, man.
That is a dependable man.

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:03.278
He's a good man too.

01:13:03.478 --> 01:13:05.378
Absolutely. How about you, Ryder?

01:13:05.478 --> 01:13:07.878
Everybody's got some good in them,
don't you think?

01:13:08.079 --> 01:13:09.979
Is this where
you try to get through to me?

01:13:10.079 --> 01:13:13.480
I don't think so, motherfucker.
Now I got three instructions for you.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.780
Number one,
when this conversation is over...

01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:18.880
...I want you to restore the power
to the whole sector.

01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.381
Number two,
I want you to clear the local tracks...

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.981
...from 68th Street
down to Coney Island.

01:13:24.081 --> 01:13:26.481
<i>And when I say, "Clear,"
I don't wanna see no cops.</i>

01:13:26.581 --> 01:13:27.981
<i>I want all the lights green.</i>

01:13:28.181 --> 01:13:30.082
Don't trip me up with a red,
got that?

01:13:30.281 --> 01:13:31.382
Absolutely.

01:13:31.582 --> 01:13:34.581
And number three,
don't play games with me...

01:13:34.782 --> 01:13:39.083
...or I'll track you down and I'll fuck you
in your greaseball ass, motherfucker!

01:13:40.882 --> 01:13:42.283
Over and out.

01:13:45.883 --> 01:13:47.484
Let's go.

01:13:52.384 --> 01:13:53.384
All right.

01:13:53.583 --> 01:13:55.984
- Know how to use one of these?
- No.

01:13:56.185 --> 01:13:57.984
It's really simple. Okay?

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.485
Safety's on, safety's off.

01:14:00.685 --> 01:14:01.985
On, off.

01:14:02.185 --> 01:14:04.885
Aim at anything you don't like,
you pull the trigger.

01:14:05.086 --> 01:14:07.686
- What if they frisk me?
- We got that covered.

01:14:09.584 --> 01:14:11.485
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:14:12.885 --> 01:14:14.385
It's got a false bottom.

01:14:14.585 --> 01:14:17.284
It's gonna be this one. You got that?

01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:20.285
- I got it.
- Good.

01:14:20.785 --> 01:14:22.185
Don't worry about it.

01:14:23.285 --> 01:14:25.285
Just don't fuck it up.

01:14:30.285 --> 01:14:31.585
Okay.

01:14:31.786 --> 01:14:33.786
We got an ID on Ryder.

01:14:34.386 --> 01:14:37.886
Dennis Ford. He was released from
Clinton Correctional two weeks ago.

01:14:38.086 --> 01:14:39.486
Did a nine-year stretch.

01:14:39.686 --> 01:14:42.186
The last four on the same cell block
as Phil Ramos.

01:14:42.386 --> 01:14:44.887
His name shows up
on an Icelandic Air passenger list...

01:14:45.087 --> 01:14:47.987
...in September of 1998,
right after Fashion Week.

01:14:48.688 --> 01:14:50.988
Dennis Ford. You remember?

01:14:51.088 --> 01:14:53.688
We used his case when
he was running as an example of...

01:14:53.888 --> 01:14:57.390
The kind of nonsense that we would
clean up if I got elected mayor, yeah.

01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:58.890
He ran a private equity firm.

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.990
His biggest client
was the pension fund.

01:15:01.090 --> 01:15:03.190
- He siphoned off...
- Twenty-million dollars.

01:15:03.391 --> 01:15:06.091
He did a plea bargain for three.
The judge gave him 10.

01:15:06.191 --> 01:15:08.289
Maybe that's why he's so pissed off.

01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:11.990
Judge gave him 10 years because we
didn't recover all of the city's money.

01:15:12.191 --> 01:15:14.190
Couple million unaccounted for.
Seed money.

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:15.390
Seed money? For what?

01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:19.492
For today, you play the terrorist card,
you panic the market into a drop.

01:15:19.591 --> 01:15:22.393
You know it's coming, you make
a great deal with $2 million.

01:15:22.592 --> 01:15:24.792
- What about the hostage money?
- That's nothing...

01:15:24.993 --> 01:15:28.492
...compared to the money you could
make. Let's get downtown to the SEC.

01:15:28.693 --> 01:15:30.893
Check the trades,
especially the put options.

01:15:46.193 --> 01:15:49.194
- Good luck, Garber.
- See you when you get back.

01:15:55.194 --> 01:15:57.195
We got company.

01:16:11.896 --> 01:16:12.896
Garber.

01:16:13.397 --> 01:16:17.197
When you put your socks on
this morning, did you ever think...?

01:16:19.098 --> 01:16:20.998
Turn around, let him frisk you.

01:16:24.098 --> 01:16:26.999
I was worried about you.
I thought maybe you'd get lost...

01:16:27.199 --> 01:16:29.699
...but then I remembered
you were a motorman, so...

01:16:29.799 --> 01:16:32.399
These tunnels don't change much,
do they?

01:16:32.599 --> 01:16:34.199
Just the people in them.

01:16:37.599 --> 01:16:39.599
- Are we good?
- It's here. We're good.

01:16:39.799 --> 01:16:41.100
All right, come on up.

01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.800
Let's go.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.701
Damn.
You're taller than I thought you'd be.

01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:10.601
You're good-looking too.
Come on, sit down.

01:17:11.302 --> 01:17:12.602
It's nice to meet you.

01:17:26.804 --> 01:17:28.804
What do you weigh,
about, what, 220?

01:17:29.704 --> 01:17:33.205
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
220 on a good day.

01:17:35.605 --> 01:17:37.405
Oh, that's Ramos.

01:17:38.205 --> 01:17:41.705
He's what you would have called
the brains in the operation.

01:17:43.506 --> 01:17:44.906
Dumb fuck.

01:17:49.407 --> 01:17:52.207
So how long has it been
since you've driven one of these?

01:17:56.008 --> 01:17:58.708
- That's why you brought me here?
- You're a motorman, right?

01:17:58.908 --> 01:18:00.809
Once a motorman,
always a motorman.

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:04.708
You play your cards right,
you might get a part of the cut.

01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:20.010
Well, this is...

01:18:20.609 --> 01:18:23.110
It's a new train.
I'm not certified on the new trains.

01:18:23.309 --> 01:18:26.609
Well, I got faith in you, man.
But I'm going to ask you one question.

01:18:26.809 --> 01:18:29.609
You know, that thing when you
told your wife about the 35 K...

01:18:29.809 --> 01:18:30.909
...how did she react?

01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:33.709
- We gotta talk about...?
- Don't be sensitive.

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:36.009
- I'm not being...
- Did she freak out or what?

01:18:36.210 --> 01:18:38.509
She wasn't happy,
but she understood.

01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:39.909
Well, that's love, right?

01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.610
No, that's marriage.
That's another thing.

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:45.310
You think they're gonna move
that train?

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.112
Seems like a possibility. How are we
with street-level, emergency exits?

01:18:49.312 --> 01:18:50.412
I got a blanket.

01:18:50.612 --> 01:18:54.012
I got radio cars and a man
at every exit from 42nd to South Ferry.

01:18:54.512 --> 01:18:56.112
We gotta go.

01:18:56.312 --> 01:18:58.312
Hey, Camonetti.

01:18:58.712 --> 01:19:00.012
Fucking greaseball, man.

01:19:00.812 --> 01:19:03.012
Hey, greaseball, speak up.

01:19:03.112 --> 01:19:05.412
I see red. I don't see green.

01:19:05.612 --> 01:19:07.612
What's taking so fucking long?

01:19:07.812 --> 01:19:09.112
Blanket is not tucked in yet.

01:19:09.313 --> 01:19:11.713
Stall him. I need two minutes,
buy me two minutes.

01:19:11.913 --> 01:19:13.413
Haven't cleared the tracks yet.

01:19:13.513 --> 01:19:16.713
Mr. Ryder, we'll be up and ready
in less than two minutes.

01:19:16.914 --> 01:19:18.713
We're gonna move forward here,
okay?

01:19:18.913 --> 01:19:21.713
We're gonna move forward,
and if we get onto a red signal...

01:19:21.813 --> 01:19:23.114
...and the brakes trip up...

01:19:23.314 --> 01:19:26.014
...your friend Walter Garber's
getting it in the head.

01:19:28.417 --> 01:19:31.016
- You got it?
- Yes, sir. I got it.

01:19:31.216 --> 01:19:32.516
Let's roll, let's roll.

01:19:33.916 --> 01:19:35.316
Hope you were bluffing.

01:19:35.516 --> 01:19:38.517
Yeah, I'm bluffing, man.
You gotta say what you gotta say.

01:19:40.616 --> 01:19:43.617
You thought by coming down here,
you'd be redeemed, didn't you?

01:19:43.817 --> 01:19:45.817
God bless you, Garber.

01:19:47.017 --> 01:19:49.317
You're more fucked up than I am.

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:52.518
At least the same fucked up.

01:19:52.718 --> 01:19:54.518
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:20:00.718 --> 01:20:01.818
Let's go.

01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:13.020
She's on the move.

01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:19.221
Put some speed on it.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:28.520
He's by me, headed south.
Male, black, at the controls.

01:20:35.021 --> 01:20:36.421
Motherfuckers.

01:20:36.521 --> 01:20:40.321
You're playing with fire, my man.
I wanna see them green.

01:20:40.422 --> 01:20:43.422
Turn to green or I'll put a hole
in Garber's head right now.

01:20:43.522 --> 01:20:45.122
- Do it!
- We believe you.

01:20:45.322 --> 01:20:46.923
We're moving as fast as we can.

01:20:47.123 --> 01:20:50.823
- What happens if they run a red light?
- It'll trip the brakes.

01:20:51.023 --> 01:20:52.423
Coming up on the first one.

01:20:55.523 --> 01:20:58.823
There, that's what I'm looking for.
That's what I'm looking for.

01:20:59.322 --> 01:21:00.522
Here he comes, right now.

01:21:13.725 --> 01:21:16.026
Garber's driving the train.
Sniper confirmed it.

01:21:16.126 --> 01:21:18.926
What are you saying, he's
in on it? There ain't no way.

01:21:19.126 --> 01:21:21.026
Sniper killed Ramos,
he was their driver...

01:21:21.226 --> 01:21:23.026
...they probably need Garber
to drive.

01:21:31.627 --> 01:21:35.628
They get to Coney Island, they hit the
trippers and the brakes will come on.

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:41.529
- Is that 33rd?
- Yes, sir.

01:21:41.729 --> 01:21:44.229
- How far to the signal?
- About a tenth of a mile.

01:21:44.429 --> 01:21:47.329
You stop when we get there.
We're moving out. You got that?

01:21:47.529 --> 01:21:48.930
I'm slowing down now.

01:21:57.529 --> 01:21:58.630
Are they slowing down?

01:21:58.829 --> 01:22:01.030
They have to.
They're coming up to a signal point.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.730
What is that?

01:22:07.931 --> 01:22:09.931
You're the old motorman,
you tell me.

01:22:24.932 --> 01:22:28.232
- She stopped just below 33rd Street.
- What the hell are they doing?

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:29.832
Oh, jeez.

01:22:30.032 --> 01:22:31.132
Why that little stop?

01:22:31.332 --> 01:22:33.233
Train has to stop at signal points.

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:34.633
Some kind of an override?

01:22:34.833 --> 01:22:37.833
Yep, some kind of an override,
that's right.

01:22:37.933 --> 01:22:41.833
There we go.
Okay, let's move out. Let's go, let's go.

01:23:07.936 --> 01:23:09.636
Roosevelt tunnel, which way?

01:23:10.936 --> 01:23:12.637
Which way?

01:23:18.537 --> 01:23:20.637
She's moving again.
Next stop, 28th Street.

01:23:21.137 --> 01:23:22.537
Why that little stop, huh?

01:23:22.637 --> 01:23:25.036
- I told you, the signal points.
- How do you know...

01:23:25.137 --> 01:23:28.237
...they didn't set the throttle, jump?
- We got every exit covered.

01:23:28.437 --> 01:23:29.737
There's nowhere to go.

01:23:29.937 --> 01:23:32.437
Listen, the throttle can't be set.
It has to be held.

01:23:32.537 --> 01:23:34.638
<i>It's the failsafe,
it's a dead-man's switch.</i>

01:23:34.838 --> 01:23:36.838
Doesn't have a hand
pressing down on it...

01:23:37.038 --> 01:23:40.239
...the train stops cold.
Believe me, they're still aboard.

01:23:49.540 --> 01:23:50.741
It's going faster.

01:24:00.040 --> 01:24:02.242
Emri, off the track. Come on.

01:24:20.144 --> 01:24:21.344
Let's go!

01:24:23.944 --> 01:24:26.044
Garber, come on.

01:24:27.744 --> 01:24:29.544
Come on!

01:24:40.845 --> 01:24:43.146
It's gonna derail
before it gets to Coney Island.

01:24:46.946 --> 01:24:49.247
That's it. That's it right there.
Roosevelt tunnel.

01:24:52.146 --> 01:24:54.746
It's a fucking train crossover.
Come on. Cross over now!

01:24:54.846 --> 01:24:57.346
- What?
- Come on, move!

01:25:02.247 --> 01:25:03.447
Hey!

01:25:17.648 --> 01:25:20.549
- Fuck it, let's go!
- We gotta find him!

01:25:20.649 --> 01:25:23.149
We don't have time! Let's go!

01:25:40.051 --> 01:25:42.151
I love you. I fucking love you.

01:25:42.352 --> 01:25:44.452
<i>Geo, I fucking love you too.</i>

01:25:57.953 --> 01:26:01.054
Hello? Hello?

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.559
We're getting calls.

01:27:15.759 --> 01:27:18.158
Cops on the platform
are seeing passengers...

01:27:18.359 --> 01:27:21.960
...nobody in the motorman's booth.
- Believe me, they're still aboard.

01:27:24.861 --> 01:27:26.960
It's all right!
As soon as we hit a red light...

01:27:27.161 --> 01:27:30.761
...the brakes will stop it automatically.
- Yeah, but they're all green!

01:28:37.568 --> 01:28:38.768
Four stops away.

01:28:50.368 --> 01:28:51.568
Two stops.

01:29:05.271 --> 01:29:07.271
Oh, Jesus. The train just stopped.

01:29:15.672 --> 01:29:17.772
I really gotta take that piss.

01:29:19.572 --> 01:29:22.673
There's no hijackers onboard,
just passengers.

01:29:23.773 --> 01:29:25.673
Where was that first stop
that they made?

01:29:25.873 --> 01:29:27.073
Near 34th.

01:29:27.873 --> 01:29:29.773
- That's by the Roosevelt spur.
- The what?

01:29:29.973 --> 01:29:32.974
<i>A derelict tunnel
built under the Waldorf Hotel.</i>

01:29:33.174 --> 01:29:36.774
Converge everything on that area.
Throw a goddamn dragnet over it!

01:30:10.277 --> 01:30:11.877
Hey!

01:30:22.378 --> 01:30:24.078
Freeze!

01:30:37.681 --> 01:30:39.381
Put your hands in the air!

01:31:01.782 --> 01:31:03.382
Hey!

01:31:03.782 --> 01:31:05.382
Hey!

01:31:07.082 --> 01:31:10.282
Hey. Get out, get out, get out.

01:31:10.982 --> 01:31:12.082
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:31:12.782 --> 01:31:14.082
I'm sorry.

01:31:45.685 --> 01:31:47.385
Out of the... Get out of the way!

01:32:05.089 --> 01:32:06.290
Just go, go, go.

01:32:33.591 --> 01:32:35.392
<i>- 911 operator.
- Hello? Hello?</i>

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:38.291
<i>- This is Walter Garber, MTA.
- How do you spell that?</i>

01:32:38.491 --> 01:32:40.191
Don't worry about how to spell it.

01:32:40.291 --> 01:32:42.191
Just tell Lieutenant Camonetti...

01:32:42.391 --> 01:32:44.791
...that Ryder is headed
to the Manhattan Bridge!

01:33:25.195 --> 01:33:28.796
<i>Cars everywhere. Nobody's
going anywhere for a long time.</i>

01:33:36.796 --> 01:33:37.896
Hey. Hey!

01:33:40.697 --> 01:33:42.398
- Is he in there?
- No, no, no.

01:33:42.598 --> 01:33:43.898
- No.
- Where did he go?

01:33:44.097 --> 01:33:47.498
Brooklyn. He said he couldn't wait,
he started walking.

01:33:47.698 --> 01:33:49.298
This fucking city!

01:34:23.601 --> 01:34:25.403
Come on, you guys. Move out!

01:34:35.302 --> 01:34:37.003
Ryder!

01:34:40.604 --> 01:34:41.703
Don't move.

01:34:43.204 --> 01:34:45.804
So is this how you thought
the day was going to end, huh?

01:34:46.004 --> 01:34:48.004
When you put your socks on
this morning?

01:34:48.104 --> 01:34:50.104
This make you feel better, Garber?

01:34:51.304 --> 01:34:53.305
That make everything okay now?

01:34:53.405 --> 01:34:55.704
No! But it's a start.

01:34:58.905 --> 01:35:00.705
Don't move.

01:35:23.306 --> 01:35:25.307
Don't move!

01:35:27.907 --> 01:35:29.307
Hey!

01:35:31.007 --> 01:35:34.307
Garber Baby boy,
I ain't going back to prison.

01:35:34.507 --> 01:35:38.908
I don't... I don't think you got any...
Any options now or leverage.

01:35:40.408 --> 01:35:41.608
Hey!

01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:45.509
Hey!

01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:48.209
We all owe God a death,
I told you that.

01:35:48.409 --> 01:35:50.410
You're wrong, Ryder.
We owe God life.

01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:53.210
Life. And that's the life
I gave you back today.

01:35:53.310 --> 01:35:55.510
And now you have to
give me something back.

01:35:58.410 --> 01:36:00.310
What are you talking about?

01:36:00.710 --> 01:36:03.810
You got a gun in your hand,
I want you to use it. Shoot me.

01:36:04.009 --> 01:36:08.012
No, shoot me before they shoot me,
or I'm gonna kill you.

01:36:08.911 --> 01:36:11.711
I will shoot you.
I don't want to, but I will.

01:36:11.812 --> 01:36:13.112
- Hey!
- I thought you cared.

01:36:13.312 --> 01:36:14.412
- No!
- You said:

01:36:14.512 --> 01:36:17.512
"Ryder. Ryder,
don't you have anyone who cares?"

01:36:17.612 --> 01:36:18.712
I thought that was you.

01:36:18.912 --> 01:36:21.512
- Come on, man, pay it back.
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

01:36:21.712 --> 01:36:23.513
I'm gonna give you 10,
then deal's off.

01:36:23.713 --> 01:36:27.014
I got a gun, I'm gonna use it.
I'm gonna take your life back.

01:36:28.714 --> 01:36:30.913
- Hey!
- Come on, man!

01:36:31.113 --> 01:36:36.613
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

01:36:36.813 --> 01:36:40.014
You gonna take this down to zero?
Come on, motherfucker, shoot me!

01:36:40.114 --> 01:36:42.314
I am not going to shoot you!

01:36:43.413 --> 01:36:46.215
Five, four. Come on.

01:36:46.314 --> 01:36:48.415
- Hey!
- Three.

01:36:48.716 --> 01:36:50.016
Police, drop your weapon!

01:36:50.216 --> 01:36:52.716
I'm disappointed in you. Two.

01:37:02.717 --> 01:37:04.917
You're my goddamn hero.

01:37:16.018 --> 01:37:17.919
Drop your weapon!

01:38:03.121 --> 01:38:04.722
Mr. Garber.

01:38:07.122 --> 01:38:09.222
- Interesting day, huh?
- Yes, sir.

01:38:09.421 --> 01:38:11.923
You know, just about every day
I make a speech...

01:38:12.123 --> 01:38:14.323
...and it starts with:

01:38:14.523 --> 01:38:18.123
"I'd like to thank you on behalf of
the city of New York," blah, blah, blah.

01:38:18.223 --> 01:38:20.925
And I never know
who I'm thanking or why.

01:38:21.425 --> 01:38:22.525
But you...

01:38:23.827 --> 01:38:25.327
...did a hell of a thing today.

01:38:25.526 --> 01:38:27.826
You went to bat
for the city of New York.

01:38:27.926 --> 01:38:30.926
And on behalf of me,
I'd like to thank you.

01:38:31.826 --> 01:38:34.926
Well, you're welcome.
I mean, it's been an amazing day.

01:38:35.127 --> 01:38:38.526
Everybody's thanking me all day,
but I appreciate it. You're welcome.

01:38:38.927 --> 01:38:41.127
And I want you to know...

01:38:41.328 --> 01:38:45.027
...that tomorrow, the city of New York
is going to go to bat for you.

01:38:46.728 --> 01:38:49.228
In a big way. You understand?

01:38:49.428 --> 01:38:50.428
Yes, sir.

01:38:51.328 --> 01:38:53.728
And this city
has a very good batting average.

01:38:54.528 --> 01:38:57.328
- I appreciate it.
- All right.

01:38:58.428 --> 01:38:59.428
I'm gonna get home.

01:39:00.028 --> 01:39:01.228
Oh, take my car.

01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:04.329
- No, no, I'll take...
- Put the siren on and everything.

01:39:04.529 --> 01:39:06.228
- There's a siren on there?
- Yes.

01:39:06.428 --> 01:39:08.529
No, I'll take the subway.
But I appreciate it.

01:39:08.729 --> 01:39:09.729
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:39:09.929 --> 01:39:13.330
You know, me, subway all my life.
I get home faster than you anyway.

01:39:13.429 --> 01:39:15.428
Not you, but, you know,
everybody else.

01:39:15.629 --> 01:39:17.129
But thank you, sir.

01:39:17.329 --> 01:39:18.529
You a Yankee fan?

01:39:19.029 --> 01:39:21.729
No. Well, yes. Yes, of course.

01:39:22.529 --> 01:39:23.629
Yeah, right.

01:45:28.665 --> 01:45:31.765
