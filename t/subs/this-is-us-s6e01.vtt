um, to this stupid meeting,

06:06.783 --> 06:08.659

06:08.743 --> 06:10.828

does not mean

06:13.081 --> 06:15.416
-we are nerds.
-Huh.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.168
-You know, get out of my house.
-Okay.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.003

06:24.926 --> 06:26.177

06:26.260 --> 06:27.678

is about to walk into my office
and blow up my entire day.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.165
(inhales)
So I just wanted to call you really quick

06:56.249 --> 06:57.834
and say happy birthday, Kate.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.044
I love you very much, and I miss you.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.088
Aw. I miss you, too.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.297
You sound stressed.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.341

07:07.760 --> 07:09.929
and Miguel to take the kids to Train Park.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.557
With Nicky, of course,
since they're all attached at the hip

07:12.640 --> 07:13.891

07:13.975 --> 07:15.643

07:15.726 --> 07:17.645

07:17.728 --> 07:19.647

07:32.452 --> 07:33.744

There's my romantic birthday boy.

08:15.286 --> 08:17.038
You decide on your wish yet?

08:17.121 --> 08:19.373

08:31.427 --> 08:33.763
The cops got the guy who robbed us.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.932
-(gasps)
-Caught him breaking into a parked car.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.600
Wow.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.810
-Are they sure it's our guy?
-Mm-hmm.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.439
He pawned all of our jewelry, but, um...

08:43.523 --> 08:44.774
you remember how we couldn't find

08:44.857 --> 08:46.442
one of our wedding photos last year,

08:46.526 --> 08:48.194
-thought we were losing our minds?
-Mm-hmm.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.445
He had it on him.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.572
Just the picture, not the frame.

08:51.656 --> 08:52.573
(groans)

08:52.657 --> 08:54.325
Yeah.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.701
He's, um...

08:55.785 --> 08:58.037
he's getting arraigned today.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.455
I think I might go down there.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.998
Randall,

09:01.082 --> 09:02.333
-it's your birthday.
-I want to look him

09:02.416 --> 09:04.418
in the eye, Beth,
tell him what he did to us.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.212
-To our family.
-Okay. Baby,

09:06.295 --> 09:08.047
-let's play a game, okay?
-Hmm.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.800
-There's two doors you can
choose from today.
-(inhales deeply)

09:10.883 --> 09:12.843
-(sighs)
-Behind door number one

09:12.927 --> 09:16.347
-is your beautiful,
"top of her game right now" wife...
-Yeah.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.266
...who is fulfilled in her new job

09:18.349 --> 09:20.309
and-and has a new skincare line

09:20.393 --> 09:22.853
-that has her positively glowing.
-That's true.

09:22.937 --> 09:26.440
She is clicking on all her sexy cylinders.

09:26.524 --> 09:30.486
-Mmm.
-And is ready to grant you
any birthday wish you want.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.322
-Mmm.
-Like a less-problematic <i>Aladdin</i> genie.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.699
-I like that.
-Yeah.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.034
-Yeah.
-Behind door number two,

09:37.118 --> 09:40.538
you have confronting the creeper
who broke into our home

09:40.621 --> 09:42.582
and upturned a year of our lives.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.336
You're gonna pick
door number two, aren't you?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.921
-I need to look him in the eye, Beth.
-Oh, my gosh.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.048
-You are a very unusual man.
-I know.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.341
But you really are at the top

09:52.425 --> 09:53.718
-of your game right...
-No, no, no.

09:53.801 --> 09:56.137
You only get one door, baby.
You made your choice.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.763
All right? Hey, ladies?

09:57.847 --> 09:59.807
Mom-mobile's leaving in three. All right?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.019
Damn.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.021
I would've chose door number Beth.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.857
Mmm. Mmm, mmm, <i>mmm.</i>

10:07.940 --> 10:09.358
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

goes all the way around the park

-(gasps) Two whole times?

12:08.060 --> 12:09.520
(chuckles): Would you stop bitching?

12:09.603 --> 12:12.565
Yeah, I'm sorry.
It's just this damn Facebook. I-I..

12:12.648 --> 12:15.067
You know what,
every morning since I got here,

12:15.151 --> 12:17.611
I Facebook stalk the girl who got away.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.779
I told you about her, right?

12:18.863 --> 12:20.364
-Sally?
-Sally, yes.

12:20.448 --> 12:22.783
-Yeah.
-Yes, you tell us about her every day.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.744
Every single day.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.830
Well, every single day, I lose my nerve,

12:27.913 --> 12:30.499
even though she's
just a few hours from here.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.377
(sighs) Here I am on a baby train.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.212
Oh, Nicky, shush.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.006
And who doesn't like trains?

12:37.089 --> 12:39.175
-Everybody likes trains.
-JACK: Yeah.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.676
Hey, Jack.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.095
Did I ever tell you how my
dad used to take me on trains

12:43.179 --> 12:44.513
when I was a little girl?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.682
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.101
Any Sunday my dad
had to go into the office,

12:49.185 --> 12:52.813
he would, uh, take me on the train
into the city with him.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.692
Mmm. I loved those Sundays.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.530
My dad would, uh, sit there reading--

13:01.614 --> 13:04.325
he was a big reader,
my dad, novels mainly--

13:04.408 --> 13:08.245
and, uh, I'd sit
across from him just watching

13:08.329 --> 13:11.749
<i>the world go by as the train</i>
<i>rumbled beneath us.</i>

13:11.832 --> 13:13.584
(chuckles)

13:13.667 --> 13:15.419
And then, when we would
get close to the city,

13:15.503 --> 13:18.088
he would walk me
to the very front of the train,

13:18.172 --> 13:19.882
and we'd walk back

13:19.965 --> 13:21.926
<i>through each and every car.</i>

13:22.009 --> 13:23.260
<i>All the way.</i>

13:23.344 --> 13:25.387
All the way to the back, to the...

13:27.389 --> 13:29.141
The, um...

13:30.226 --> 13:33.479
Oh, the-the last car.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.148
No, no, no, no.
D-Don't te... Don't tell me.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.566
(train engine sputters)

13:37.650 --> 13:39.193
(engine revs)

13:39.276 --> 13:40.986
(quietly): The last...

13:42.196 --> 13:45.074
Oh, that was amazing.

13:45.157 --> 13:47.034
-I'm a new woman.
-I'm glad.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.869
Your husband's very thoughtful.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.038
I wish mine would order me
a me on my birthday.

13:51.121 --> 13:53.457
Yeah. It's very Toby.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.919
Actually, it isn't.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.879
He's usually more
of, like, a giant in-person

13:58.963 --> 14:00.881
grand gesture kind of guy.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.050
This outsourcing is a little new.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.220
Not to say it's not wonderful
and much needed and...

14:06.303 --> 14:08.848
-You know, honestly, it's simpler.
-(phone vibrates)

14:14.311 --> 14:15.980

14:17.064 --> 14:18.858

14:18.941 --> 14:20.150
Kevin Pearson.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.903
(sighs) Send him in.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.198
Thank you.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.702
Casey.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.078
What, it's been, um...

14:31.161 --> 14:32.955
Five years.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.249
Five years to the day
since your national meltdown

14:35.332 --> 14:37.501
-on my set.
-You counted.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.211
You count, Kevin,

14:39.295 --> 14:41.964
when somebody torpedoes
your life and career,

14:42.047 --> 14:43.465
-you count.
-Huh.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.802
I supposed you would, but hey,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.470
looks like you landed
on your feet, though, right?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.847
I mean, this is a hell of a show.

14:49.930 --> 14:51.765
The writing is phenomenal.

14:51.849 --> 14:52.766
I never worked on it.

14:52.850 --> 14:55.102
I'm a fan.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.021
Oh.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.775
Look, man, I...

15:01.859 --> 15:03.360
We both know we were forced

15:03.444 --> 15:05.154
to take this meeting by our agents, right?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.114
I mean, y-you don't want me
to do whatever movie this is.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.741
I don't want to do whatever movie this is.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.910
They want to reboot <i>The Manny, </i>Kevin.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.373
-So...
-There is no film.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.292
They knew you'd never show up if...

15:18.375 --> 15:19.710
Let me get this straight.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.795
-They want me to play the Manny again?
-What?

15:21.879 --> 15:24.465
No, you're far too old.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.799
No, you play the dad.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.968
A dad to twins, ironically.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.303
Huh.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.556
Kevin, I-I saw the last film.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.726
I actually purchased a ticket.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.478
And after 90 minutes, when I realized

15:37.561 --> 15:40.022
it was only halfway over,
I started to lick

15:40.105 --> 15:42.775
the movie theater seats
in an attempt to give myself COVID.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.401
Okay.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.821
I know what's out there for you right now.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.156
This is good.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.700
You get to raise
your family in Los Angeles,

15:51.784 --> 15:54.703
work one day a week
and become a zillionaire.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.581
Or say no.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.999
And spend the rest of your years

15:59.083 --> 16:00.668
travelling to Vancouver every weekend

16:00.751 --> 16:02.294
to shoot Treat Williams indies

16:02.378 --> 16:04.672
where you got to do your own hair.

16:12.554 --> 16:14.014
Over my dead body.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.016
(sighs) Thank God.

16:18.727 --> 16:22.189
Mr. Watkins, you are
being charged with burglary

16:22.272 --> 16:24.274
while in possession of an offensive weapon

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
and criminal trespass.

16:26.193 --> 16:29.405
-Do you understand the charges?
-WATKINS: Yes.

16:29.488 --> 16:33.075
MAGISTRATE: Preliminary hearing
will be set for four weeks from today,

16:33.158 --> 16:36.829
and bail has been set as noted.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.042
-(departing footsteps)
<i>-(door opens)</i>

16:44.628 --> 16:46.171
(door closes)

16:48.549 --> 16:51.051
Excuse me, Officer, um...

16:51.135 --> 16:54.513
-Randall Pearson,
councilman for District...
-District 12.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.140
Yes, sir. My wife and I voted for you.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.641
We plan on doing it again.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.518
Well, that makes this a lot easier.

16:59.601 --> 17:01.145
Um...

17:01.228 --> 17:03.272
Do you think I could speak
with him for a couple minutes?

17:04.356 --> 17:05.899
Sure thing, Councilman.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.026
I'll be right here if you need me.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.746
Do you know who I am?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.878
You're the guy from my picture.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.221
(door opens)

17:42.394 --> 17:44.396
(Jack sighs)

17:44.480 --> 17:46.356
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.362
How are they?

17:52.446 --> 17:55.491
Oh, they barely said
a word on the ride home.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.535
And I started their
day out with Tang, Jack.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.246
-With Tang.
-Yeah. We'll talk to 'em, Bec.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.333
Just like we did when the goldfish died.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.960
Uh, a spaceship filled with heroes

18:07.044 --> 18:08.754
exploded on national television.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.714
I don't think
the Splishy and Splashy model

18:10.798 --> 18:12.674
-is gonna work here.
-Bec.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.469
We can do this.

18:15.552 --> 18:18.347
Okay? Okay.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.103
(approaching footsteps)

18:24.186 --> 18:26.355
Hey, Big Three.

18:26.438 --> 18:28.816
REBECCA: Hey, guys?

18:28.899 --> 18:31.235
Uh, Daddy and I just... we wanted to see

18:31.318 --> 18:34.613
if there is anything that
you wanted to talk about.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.115
About today?

18:39.785 --> 18:43.747
'Cause I know, for me...

18:43.831 --> 18:46.750
I had a lot of sad feelings.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.753
-Did any of you maybe feel like that?
-JACK: Yeah.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.882
You know, like maybe
when Splishy and Splashy...

18:53.966 --> 18:55.134
(whispers): Don't do Splishy and Splashy.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.136
I'm telling you, it's a good way in.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.971
All the teachers were crying.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.473
Yeah.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.350
I bet they were, Bug.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.603
It's a good thing they were that high up.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.231
That means they were closer to heaven.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.567
Yeah.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.111
I think that's a really nice thought, Bug.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.323
Maybe Splishy and Splashy
will take care of them.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.038
Boys, how about you?

19:25.122 --> 19:28.000
You-you guys feeling a little sad, too?
