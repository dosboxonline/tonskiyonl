<i>Little honey,</i>
<i>are you goin' out tonight?</i>

02:20.014 --> 02:21.890
Sonny,
you wanna hit me up
with some syrup?

02:22.809 --> 02:24.101
Thank you, darling.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.938
Ma'am?
Yeah, I'll be
right with you.

02:29.274 --> 02:33.569
Here you go.
You got the sausage,
pancakes for you,

02:33.653 --> 02:34.903
and there's your syrup.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.613
He's over there.
Uh-huh.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.618
Decaf or regular?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.370
Regular, please.

02:43.454 --> 02:45.873
You girls are kind of
young to be smoking,
don't you think?

02:45.957 --> 02:47.499
It ruins
your sex drive.

02:59.888 --> 03:01.221
I'll get it!

03:03.558 --> 03:05.726
I got it! Hello?

03:06.144 --> 03:08.478
Hey, how you doing,
little housewife?
You all packed?

03:08.563 --> 03:09.855
We're out
of here tonight.

03:09.939 --> 03:12.691
Well, wait now.
I still have to ask
Darryl if I can go.

03:12.775 --> 03:14.776
You mean you haven't
asked him, yet?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.154
Thelma,
for Christ's sake!

03:17.780 --> 03:19.907
Thelma,
is he your husband
or your father?

03:19.991 --> 03:22.367
It is just two days,
for God's sake.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.454
Don't be a child.
Tell him
you're going with me.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.539
Tell him I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.249
That don't carry much
weight with Darryl.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.460
He already thinks
you're out of your mind.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.086
Are you at work?

03:33.171 --> 03:34.796
<i>No, I'm calling from</i>
<i>the Playboy Mansion.</i>

03:34.881 --> 03:36.548
I'll call you right back.

03:37.717 --> 03:38.884
Darryl?

03:40.803 --> 03:41.929
Darryl!

03:42.305 --> 03:44.264
Honey,
you better
hurry up!

03:49.479 --> 03:51.146
God damn it, Thelma.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.649
Don't holler like that.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.196
Haven't I told you
I can't stand it

03:59.280 --> 04:00.614
when you holler
in the morning?

04:00.698 --> 04:03.951
I'm sorry, doll.
I just didn't
want you to be late.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.661
Thank you.

04:10.625 --> 04:12.125
Hon?
What?

04:14.128 --> 04:15.462
Uh...

04:16.547 --> 04:18.005
Have a good day
at work today.

04:18.173 --> 04:19.423
Uh-huh.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.052
Jesus.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.054
Thank you, no.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.558
Hon?

04:29.435 --> 04:30.519
What?

04:31.646 --> 04:33.855
You want anything special
for dinner tonight?

04:35.692 --> 04:38.735
No, Thelma,
I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.447
I may not even
make it home for dinner.
You know how Fridays are.

04:43.658 --> 04:48.036
Yeah, funny how
so many people want to buy
a carpet on a Friday night.

04:48.871 --> 04:52.124
You'd almost think
they'd want to forget
about it for the weekend.

04:53.334 --> 04:56.795
Well, then it's a good thing
you're not regional manager

04:58.214 --> 04:59.548
and I am.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.555
For Christ's sake,
I got to get
the hell out of here.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.181
Jesus!

05:09.100 --> 05:12.227
God damn it, Homer!
Christ, I gotta
get to work!

05:12.687 --> 05:14.980
Don't need this
bullshit in the morning!

05:15.064 --> 05:17.190
Just leave them.
I'll get them,
thank you.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.860
For Christ's sakes.

05:22.905 --> 05:25.866
And I want you
out of here by 5:00.
No, 3:00.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.826
Get out of here
by 3:00 today.

05:34.292 --> 05:35.500
Good morning.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.336
Morning,
<i>is Louise there?</i>

05:37.420 --> 05:38.795
Why, yes, she is.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.090
Is this Thelma?
Thelma, when are you
gonna run away with me?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.925
Not this weekend, sweetie,
she's running away with me.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.218
Hey, what'd he say?

05:45.303 --> 05:46.803
What time are you
picking me up?

05:46.888 --> 05:49.765
<i>All right! I'll be there</i>
<i>around 2:00 or 3:00.</i>

05:50.266 --> 05:53.101
Okay. Say, what kind
of stuff do I bring?

05:53.311 --> 05:55.520
I don't know.
Warm stuff, I guess.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.439
It's the mountains.
I guess it gets
cold at night.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.899
I don't know.
I'm just gonna
bring everything.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.443
Okay, I will,
too, then.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.528
<i>And steal</i>
<i>Darryl's fishing stuff.</i>

06:03.613 --> 06:05.405
Louise, I don't
know how to fish.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.200
Neither do I, Thelma,
but Darryl does it.
How hard can it be?

06:08.284 --> 06:10.369
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.454
Okay. All right, bye.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.313
<i>As you brush your shoes</i>

06:38.398 --> 06:42.901
<i>And stand before the mirror</i>

06:42.985 --> 06:45.320
<i>And you comb your hair</i>

06:45.405 --> 06:49.783
<i>And grab your coat and out</i>

06:49.867 --> 06:52.035
<i>And you walk the wet streets</i>

06:52.120 --> 06:55.163
<i>Trying to remember</i>

06:56.666 --> 07:02.045
<i>All the wild night breezes</i>
<i>in your memory ever</i>

07:02.839 --> 07:06.341
<i>And everything</i>
<i>looks so complete</i>

07:06.884 --> 07:09.428
<i>When you're walkin'</i>
<i>out on the street</i>

07:09.512 --> 07:13.348
Hey,
<i>this is Jimmy.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:17.227
<i>And sends you flyin', cryin'</i>

07:18.020 --> 07:23.191
Ooh-wee

07:24.944 --> 07:29.531
<i>The wild night is callin'</i>

07:37.331 --> 07:39.541
<i>And all the girls walk by</i>

07:40.168 --> 07:41.710
Hey.
Hey.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.299
No, Thelma,
we don't need the lantern.
The place has electricity.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.759
Okay. No, I want
to take it anyway,
just in case.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.052
In case of what?

07:51.137 --> 07:54.347
In case there's some
escaped psycho killer
on the loose

07:54.432 --> 07:56.475
who cuts
the electricity off

07:56.559 --> 07:58.393
and tries to
come in and kill us.

07:58.478 --> 08:02.022
Sure, Thelma.
Well, then that lantern'll
come in real handy.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.108
Maybe we should
just tow your car
behind, too,

08:05.193 --> 08:07.152
in case he steals
the spark plugs.

08:07.236 --> 08:09.571
We'd have to.
That thing barely makes it
down the driveway.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.466
Careful. Careful.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.260
All right,
everything in?
Yeah.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.761
Careful.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.764
Here you go.
Be careful.
All right.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.433
Smile.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.567
Sit down!

08:49.195 --> 08:51.112
Oh, Louise?
Uh-huh.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.697
Will you take care
of this gun?

08:52.782 --> 08:54.449
What in hell did
you bring that for?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.619
Come on.
Psycho killers or
bears or snakes.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.871
I just don't know
how to use it.
Will you take care of it?

08:59.956 --> 09:02.624
Put it away. Just...
Here, put it in my purse.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.210
Thelma, good Lord.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.342
So, whose place
is this again?

09:12.426 --> 09:15.095
It's Bob's,
the day manager's.

09:15.179 --> 09:17.180
He's getting a divorce,
so his wife's getting
this place.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.932
So he's letting all
his friends use it

09:19.016 --> 09:20.850
till he's got to
turn over the keys.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.314
I've never been out
of town without Darryl.

09:26.399 --> 09:29.401
How come
Darryl let you go?

09:29.485 --> 09:31.111
'Cause I didn't ask him.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.821
Shit, Thelma!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.116
He's gonna kill you!

09:36.200 --> 09:38.285
Well, he'd never
let me go.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.038
He never lets me do
one goddamn thing
that's any fun.

09:42.123 --> 09:45.125
All he wants me to do
is hang around the house
the whole time

09:45.209 --> 09:47.460
while he's out doing
God only knows what.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.838
Well, you get
what you settle for.

09:50.881 --> 09:52.257
I left him a note.

09:53.843 --> 09:55.844
I left him stuff
to microwave.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.432
<i>Children laugh,</i>
<i>children cry</i>

10:00.516 --> 10:03.184
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>who will survive</i>

10:03.269 --> 10:06.187
<i>Will they know</i>
<i>what we've sold?</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:09.149
<i>Nature's gift</i>
<i>we turn for gold</i>

10:09.233 --> 10:12.277
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>what I see now</i>

10:12.361 --> 10:15.113
<i>In my life,</i>
<i>what I see now</i>

10:15.197 --> 10:17.949
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>where we're goin'</i>

10:18.034 --> 10:20.744
<i>I don't like it, no</i>

10:20.828 --> 10:22.495
Thelma.
What?

10:22.955 --> 10:27.375
<i>You and I,</i>
<i>we're getting older now</i>

10:27.460 --> 10:29.628
<i>You and I</i>

10:29.712 --> 10:33.548
<i>Who will show them</i>
<i>if we don't show them how?</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:38.303
<i>I wanna know, is it true?</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:44.059
<i>Is there a house of hope</i>
<i>for me and you?</i>

10:44.727 --> 10:46.269
Thelma,
what are you doing?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.562
Smoking.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.275
Hey, I'm Louise.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.945
<i>House of hope</i>
<i>for me and you</i>

10:58.449 --> 11:01.701
I'll never make it.
Can't we just stop
somewhere for a minute?

11:01.786 --> 11:04.913
Thelma, we're not gonna
get to the cabin until
after dark as it is.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.374
Then what difference
would it make
if we stopped?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.168
Come on,
I never get to do
stuff like this.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.504
Okay. But it's gonna
be a quick stop.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.588
Fine, okay.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.705
<i>I'm still waiting here,</i>
<i>and it's half past two</i>

11:46.789 --> 11:52.001
<i>And I don't wanna</i>
<i>love you, but I do</i>

11:52.128 --> 11:54.421
I haven't seen
a place like this
since I left Texas.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.047
Isn't this fun?

11:56.132 --> 12:00.677
<i>That place with</i>
<i>a little dance floor</i>

12:02.680 --> 12:07.517
<i>Said you'd never</i>
<i>been in there before</i>

12:09.270 --> 12:10.937
Y'all want a drink?

12:11.021 --> 12:12.063
No, thanks.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.108
I'll have a Wild Turkey
straight up and
a Coke back, please.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.568
Thelma?

12:16.652 --> 12:17.902
Oh, what?
Tell me something.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.779
Is this my vacation
or isn't it?

12:19.864 --> 12:22.323
I mean, God,
you're as bad as Darryl.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.410
I'm sorry, it's just
I'm just not used to
seeing you this way.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.872
I... I haven't seen you
this way in a while.
You're usually so sedate.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.750
Well, I've had it
up to my ass with sedate.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.502
You said you and me
is gonna get out of town,

12:34.587 --> 12:36.963
and for once,
just really let
our hair down.

12:37.047 --> 12:40.258
Well, darling, look out,
'cause my hair
is coming down.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.635
All right.
I've changed my mind.

12:42.720 --> 12:47.599
I'm gonna have a margarita
and a shot of Cuervo
on the side.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.268
All right!
Get me another one.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.062
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>love you, but I do</i>

12:53.147 --> 12:54.355
Hey.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.568
Now, what are a couple
of Kewpie dolls like you
doing in a place like this?

12:58.694 --> 13:00.445
We left town
for the weekend...
Minding our own business.

13:00.529 --> 13:01.488
Why don't you try?

13:01.572 --> 13:03.031
...'cause we wanted to
try and have some fun.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.284
And 'cause Louise here
is mad at her boyfriend
'cause...

13:07.578 --> 13:09.329
We just wanted to
get something to eat.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.997
Well, you come
to the right place.

13:11.081 --> 13:13.625
Do you like chili?
They got good chili.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.378
Harlan, you bothering
these poor girls?

13:17.463 --> 13:19.297
Hell, no, I was
just being friendly.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.050
It's a good thing
they're not all
as friendly as you.

13:23.219 --> 13:26.638
Hey, your name's
Harlan? I got
an uncle named Harlan.

13:26.722 --> 13:27.972
You do?
Uh-huh.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.432
Is he a funny uncle?

13:29.517 --> 13:32.393
'Cause if he is,
then he and I got
something in common.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.983
I don't mean
to be rude,

13:39.068 --> 13:42.153
but I got something
I got to talk to my friend
about in private.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.031
I... I understand.
I didn't mean
to bother you.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.868
It's just hard not to
notice two such pretty
ladies as yourselves.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.708
You better dance with me
before you leave,
or I will never forgive you.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.752
Sure, that'd be fun.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.758
Jeez, Louise,
that wasn't very nice.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.052
Can't you tell
when somebody's
hitting on you?

14:06.136 --> 14:07.846
So what if he was?

14:08.305 --> 14:11.057
It's all your years of
waiting tables has made
you jaded, that's all.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.393
Maybe.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.563
Well, just relax, will you?
You're making me nervous.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.772
All right!

14:33.956 --> 14:37.041
<i>I woke up in a hotel</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do</i>

14:37.126 --> 14:39.127
<i>I turned the TV on</i>
<i>and wrote a letter to you</i>

14:39.211 --> 14:40.545
That's a good band.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.715
<i>The news was talking</i>
<i>about a dragnet</i>
<i>up on the interstate</i>

14:45.426 --> 14:48.219
<i>Seems they were looking</i>
<i>for a Cadillac</i>
<i>with Tennessee plates</i>

14:48.304 --> 14:49.637
Wonder if Darryl's home yet.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.055
Wonder if Jimmy's
got back.

14:51.807 --> 14:54.058
Why don't you just
tell him to get lost
once and for all?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.477
Why don't you ditch that
no-good husband of yours?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.771
Huh? Huh?

14:58.856 --> 15:00.648
This one's on Harlan.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.818
Thanks.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.908
Well, look, Jimmy'll
come in off the road
and you won't be there.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.994
He'll freak out
and call you
100,000 times.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.537
Sunday night,
you'll call him back,

15:14.622 --> 15:16.915
and by Monday,
he'll be kissing
the ground you walk on.

15:16.999 --> 15:18.249
Exactly.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.585
In the meantime,
you said we was
gonna have some fun,

15:20.669 --> 15:22.337
so let's have some!

15:23.130 --> 15:24.589
All right.
Okay.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.180
<i>If they knew</i>
<i>what we were up to,</i>
<i>they wouldn't let us in</i>

15:32.348 --> 15:34.974
<i>Landed in Memphis</i>
<i>like original sin</i>

15:35.059 --> 15:39.687
<i>Up Elvis Presley Boulevard</i>
<i>to the Graceland gates</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:42.774
<i>Yeah, see, we were</i>
<i>looking for a Cadillac</i>
<i>with Tennessee plates</i>

15:42.858 --> 15:44.734
Let's dance.
All right!

15:51.075 --> 15:54.202
<i>I woke up in a hotel</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do</i>

15:54.286 --> 15:57.121
<i>I turned the TV on</i>
<i>and wrote a letter to you</i>

15:57.206 --> 16:00.083
<i>The news was talking</i>
<i>about a dragnet</i>
<i>up on the interstate</i>

16:00.167 --> 16:03.044
Thelma.
That's your name? Thelma?
That's a lovely name.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.088
I don't know
what I'm doing.

16:05.172 --> 16:06.464
Just follow me, Thelma.

16:06.548 --> 16:07.548
I don't know what...

16:09.218 --> 16:11.427
Ma'am, you wanna
dance a little?
Sure.

16:11.887 --> 16:15.264
<i>Since I left California, baby</i>
<i>Things have gotten worse</i>

16:15.349 --> 16:18.476
<i>Seems the land of opportunity</i>
<i>for me is just a curse</i>

16:18.560 --> 16:21.896
<i>Tell that judge in Bakersfield</i>
<i>my trial will have to wait</i>

16:23.482 --> 16:27.276
<i>Down here, they're</i>
<i>looking for a Cadillac</i>
<i>with Tennessee plates</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:30.780
<i>She saw him singing once</i>
<i>when she was 17</i>

16:30.864 --> 16:33.741
<i>And ever since that day</i>
<i>she's been living in between</i>

16:33.826 --> 16:35.284
You got some
great moves, honey.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.828
<i>I was never king of nothing</i>
<i>but this wild weekend</i>

16:36.912 --> 16:40.164
<i>Anyway, he wouldn't care</i>
<i>Hell, he gave them</i>
<i>to his friends</i>

16:42.710 --> 16:45.294
All right! Here we go!
Here we go! Here we go!

17:54.490 --> 17:56.657
Hey, hey, Thelma!
Oh, Louise.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.827
I'm hitting the little
girls' room and then
we're out of here.

18:00.662 --> 18:02.663
I'm ready
when you are.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.335
Wait, Louise,
I want to come
with you.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.796
Turn around.

18:11.673 --> 18:14.342
I don't feel so good.
What's wrong? Come on.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.096
Shit. Stop!
What's wrong?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.390
I'm spinning.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.769
Oopsy-doopsy.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.396
We need to get you
some fresh air,
little lady.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.856
Uh-huh.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.465
Look, have you
seen my friend?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.675
Your friend?

18:55.759 --> 18:59.554
Uh... Yeah. Yeah.
She was out there
dancing. Dancing.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.684
How you
feeling now, darling?

19:05.227 --> 19:06.561
Oh. Thanks.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.730
I think I'm starting
to feel a little better.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.693
You're starting to feel
pretty good to me, too.
You know that?

19:14.278 --> 19:16.154
I think I need
to keep walking.

19:16.238 --> 19:18.573
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19:18.657 --> 19:20.158
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.409
I'm going back inside.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.577
Oh, no, no.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.203
Harlan.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.329
What?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.248
Hey, quit it.
Stop it. Stop it.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.584
Thelma, Thelma,
listen to me.
Listen to me.

19:30.127 --> 19:33.087
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I just wanna kiss you.

19:33.630 --> 19:34.755
All right?
No. No.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.924
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.846
Goddamn, you are gorgeous.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.014
All right, let me
go now. Come on.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.057
Let me go!
I mean, I'm married!

19:45.142 --> 19:47.143
Come on.
That's okay,
I'm married, too.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.312
I don't feel good.
I've been sick.

19:49.396 --> 19:50.563
<i>Aw.</i>

19:51.231 --> 19:54.483
Listen to me,
I said I'm not gonna
hurt you. All right?

19:55.027 --> 19:57.653
Relax.
Harlan, stop it,
please! I mean it!

19:58.238 --> 20:01.782
Wait, don't! I mean it!
Louise is gonna wonder
where I am!

20:01.867 --> 20:03.826
Fuck Louise! Fuck...

20:03.994 --> 20:04.994
Hey!

20:06.622 --> 20:09.749
Don't ever
fucking hit me!
Fucking bitch!

20:11.084 --> 20:13.669
Harlan, please!
Harlan, please!
Do you hear me?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.214
Don't hurt me,
Harlan, please!
Shut up!

20:16.298 --> 20:18.049
Shut the fuck up!
You hear me?

20:18.133 --> 20:19.842
Shut up!
Please.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.719
Please don't
hurt me, Harlan!

20:21.803 --> 20:23.012
Goddamn bitch!

20:23.096 --> 20:24.513
Don't hurt me, Harlan!

20:25.766 --> 20:27.808
Let her go!
Louise!

20:27.893 --> 20:29.352
Get the fuck
out of here.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.314
Louise!

20:33.941 --> 20:35.733
You let her go,
you fucking asshole,

20:35.817 --> 20:38.778
or I'm gonna
splatter your ugly face
all over this nice car.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.250
All right, hey, hey,
hey, just calm down.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.543
We were just having
a little fun, that's all.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.672
Looks like you got
a real fucked-up
idea of fun.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.509
Come on.
Come on.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.682
Turn around.

21:12.479 --> 21:14.063
In the future,

21:15.065 --> 21:17.024
when a woman's
crying like that,

21:18.026 --> 21:19.860
she isn't having any fun!

21:25.701 --> 21:29.078
Bitch!
I should've gone ahead
and fucked her!

21:31.873 --> 21:33.457
What did you say?

21:33.542 --> 21:35.543
I said,
"Suck my cock."

21:41.425 --> 21:44.343
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.554
Get the car.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.431
Louise, you shot him.

21:49.182 --> 21:50.725
Oh, my God.
Get the car.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.403
You watch your mouth, buddy.

22:08.535 --> 22:10.619
Louise, come on!

22:26.094 --> 22:28.304
Watch it,
you fucking asshole!

22:41.610 --> 22:42.860
Louise?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.911
Louise, where
are we going?

22:52.287 --> 22:55.373
I don't know. I don't know.
Just shut up so I can think.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.293
Shouldn't we go
to the cops?

22:59.378 --> 23:02.129
I mean, I think
we ought to tell
the police.

23:02.255 --> 23:03.255
Tell them what, Thelma?

23:03.340 --> 23:05.299
Just what do you think
we should tell them, huh?

23:05.592 --> 23:07.676
I don't know.
Just tell them
what happened.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.095
Which part?

23:09.638 --> 23:12.848
All of it. That... That...
That he was raping me.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.142
Jeez, about a hundred
goddamn people
saw you dancing

23:15.227 --> 23:16.727
cheek to cheek
with him all night!

23:16.812 --> 23:17.895
Who's gonna believe that?

23:17.979 --> 23:20.147
We don't live in
that kind of a world,
Thelma.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.982
God damn it, pull over!

24:01.690 --> 24:02.857
All right.

24:08.738 --> 24:09.905
Thelma?

24:11.867 --> 24:12.992
Thelma.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.577
Huh?

24:18.373 --> 24:20.624
Thelma, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

24:22.335 --> 24:25.671
I'm gonna stop someplace
for a cup of coffee
and then...

24:25.755 --> 24:29.383
Just for a second,
and then I'm gonna
get it together.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.553
And we'll figure out
then what to do.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.515
And everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.976
Everything's gonna be...
All right?

24:39.060 --> 24:40.060
Uh-huh.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.332
Now is not
the time to panic.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.125
If we panic now,
we're done for.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.547
Nobody saw it.
Nobody knows it was us.

25:08.632 --> 25:09.840
Okay.

25:09.925 --> 25:11.467
So we're still okay.

25:12.928 --> 25:16.347
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

25:16.431 --> 25:20.226
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do.

25:23.104 --> 25:27.399
I'll say one thing.
This is some vacation.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.445
I sure am
having a good time.
This is real fun.

25:33.240 --> 25:36.659
If you weren't concerned
with having so much fun,
we wouldn't be here right now.

25:37.494 --> 25:39.161
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

25:39.246 --> 25:40.704
It just means
shut up, Thelma.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.333
So this is all
my fault, is it?

25:50.799 --> 25:53.676
<i>I don't wanna play house</i>

25:54.553 --> 25:59.473
<i>I know it can't be fun</i>

26:07.649 --> 26:09.400
I have to go
to the bathroom.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.780
Sorry.

26:18.785 --> 26:20.202
Can I get you
anything else?

26:20.287 --> 26:21.620
Just the check, please.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.803
Thanks,
I'll try again later.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.182
Move back,
people.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.852
Stand away from
the line, please.

26:46.688 --> 26:48.981
No, it's secured
until further notice.

26:52.986 --> 26:55.070
Could you identify them
if you saw them again?

26:55.155 --> 26:56.614
Hell, I told you 50 times.

26:56.698 --> 26:59.074
Yeah, I could identify them,
but neither one of those two

26:59.159 --> 27:01.243
was the type to pull
something like this.

27:01.911 --> 27:05.247
Well, you're not
exactly an expert witness,
but what makes you so sure?

27:05.332 --> 27:08.917
If waiting tables in a bar
don't make you an expert
on human nature,

27:09.002 --> 27:10.085
nothing will.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.921
I could've told you
Harlan Puckett was
gonna end up

27:13.006 --> 27:14.506
buying it in
a parking lot.

27:14.883 --> 27:17.426
I'm just surprised
it didn't happen
sooner than this.

27:17.510 --> 27:18.594
Who do you think did it?

27:18.678 --> 27:20.137
Has anybody
asked his wife?

27:20.221 --> 27:21.847
She's the one
I hope did it.

27:22.515 --> 27:25.309
Lena, do you have
any ideas or don't you?

27:25.393 --> 27:29.980
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say it was some old gal,
some old gal's husband.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.733
But it wasn't neither
one of those two.

27:32.817 --> 27:35.402
The smaller one,
the one with
the tidy hairdo,

27:36.237 --> 27:37.988
she left me
a huge tip.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.407
Well.
What?

27:40.784 --> 27:44.411
You didn't happen
to notice what kind of car
they were driving, did you?

27:45.246 --> 27:47.915
It's a nightclub, Hal,
not a drive-in.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.377
I don't follow
the customers out
to the parking lot.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.337
All right.
Lena, go on home.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.382
Oh! You kept me here
all night to ask me

27:56.466 --> 27:58.550
the same old question
over and over again.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.764
Ain't you gonna offer me
some teeny-weeny,
witty-bitty little drink?

28:04.766 --> 28:06.475
Behave yourself.
Oh!

28:08.603 --> 28:11.355
Neither of those two
was the murdering type, Hal.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.074
<i>Hi, this is Jimmy.</i>

28:31.835 --> 28:33.252
Thelma, you in there?

28:33.336 --> 28:34.628
Uh-huh.

28:44.931 --> 28:47.391
Thelma, come on,
we're out of here!
Thelma, come on.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.318
We're gonna need money.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.904
Thelma, how much money
you have on you?

29:01.823 --> 29:02.990
What?

29:04.784 --> 29:07.578
I'm gonna stop
at the next town.
We'll get a motel room.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.414
I can rest for a little bit
and then I'll figure out
what to do.

29:10.498 --> 29:11.707
Okay.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.001
Wait, I'm looking.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.131
$61.

29:20.633 --> 29:21.842
Shit.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.387
$41.

29:27.515 --> 29:29.099
We're gonna need
more money.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.394
What are you doing?
Why are you unpacking?

29:34.022 --> 29:36.148
You said we was just
gonna take a nap.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.150
I'm trying
to figure out
what to do.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.116
When you figure it out,
just wake me up.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.913
What the hell's
wrong with you?

29:52.207 --> 29:53.457
What's that
supposed to mean?

29:53.541 --> 29:54.958
I mean, why are you
acting like this?

29:55.043 --> 29:58.086
Acting like what?
How am I supposed
to act?

29:58.838 --> 30:02.299
Excuse me for not knowing
how to act when you blow
somebody away!

30:02.383 --> 30:04.510
You could help me
try to figure out
what to do, all right?

30:04.594 --> 30:07.179
I'm trying to
figure out what to do.
But you could try...

30:07.263 --> 30:10.933
I did! I had a suggestion
that we go to the police,

30:11.017 --> 30:13.644
but you didn't like that,
so frankly, Louise,
I'm out of ideas.

30:13.728 --> 30:15.145
What's the big rush,
Thelma?

30:15.230 --> 30:17.856
I mean, if we
give them enough time,
they'll come to us.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.789
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.416
I'm just not ready
to go to jail yet, okay?

30:40.171 --> 30:42.214
Why don't you... Um...

30:43.633 --> 30:47.135
Why don't you go out
to the pool and take a swim
or something, all right?

30:47.762 --> 30:49.680
Now, I'll figure out
what to do.

30:52.392 --> 30:54.893
Jimmy, this is Louise.
Look, I've been
trying to call you.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.229
Louise?
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

30:57.605 --> 30:58.772
Hi.

30:59.107 --> 31:02.276
<i>Where the hell are you at?</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

31:02.735 --> 31:06.280
Yeah, I'm fine.
How are you?
Long time no see.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.448
<i>You sound kind</i>
<i>of funny, Louise.</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:10.617
I am funny.
Real funny.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.370
<i>Are you in town?</i>
<i>It sounds long-distance.</i>

31:14.414 --> 31:16.540
No, I'm out of town.
I'm in...

31:18.918 --> 31:21.128
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep Shit, Arkansas.

31:22.964 --> 31:26.383
Louise,
now you just tell me what
the hell's going on here.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.636
I come back,
nobody knows
where you are.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.514
Is Thelma with you?

31:32.599 --> 31:33.682
<i>Listen, Jimmy.</i>

31:35.059 --> 31:37.269
I have about $6,700
in the bank.

31:37.353 --> 31:42.816
Now, I know
you can't get it out,
but I need that money.

31:43.860 --> 31:47.738
Can you wire me the $6,700
and I'll pay you back?

31:47.822 --> 31:50.032
What the fuck is going
on here, Louise?

31:50.825 --> 31:52.159
Listen,

31:54.287 --> 31:56.163
something real bad
has happened.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.626
And I can't
tell you what.

32:02.712 --> 32:06.965
Just that I did it
and I can't undo it.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.304
<i>Will you help me, please?</i>

32:12.764 --> 32:15.349
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
baby, of course I can.

32:16.559 --> 32:17.976
<i>Where? Why can't</i>
<i>I bring it to you?</i>

32:27.028 --> 32:28.153
Jimmy.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.742
Do you love me?

32:39.374 --> 32:40.499
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:40.875 --> 32:43.001
Never mind.
Never mind.
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

32:43.086 --> 32:44.336
Look, just...

32:46.297 --> 32:50.008
Just wire it to Western Union
in Oklahoma City, okay?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.094
<i>So that's</i>
<i>where you're at,</i>
<i>Oklahoma, huh?</i>

32:52.178 --> 32:53.345
Not yet.

32:53.721 --> 32:56.473
You call me back
and I'll tell you
which office to go to.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.141
All right. All right.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.310
I'll call you back
in an hour.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.565
Thelma!

33:06.025 --> 33:11.655
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

33:13.574 --> 33:14.825
Thelma!

33:14.909 --> 33:17.244
<i>So many miles to go</i>
<i>before I die</i>

33:17.328 --> 33:18.704
Thelma!

33:18.788 --> 33:20.080
What?
Get in the car!

33:20.164 --> 33:21.248
Okay.

33:21.416 --> 33:26.211
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

33:28.840 --> 33:33.427
<i>But still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

33:36.305 --> 33:41.101
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

33:41.769 --> 33:44.980
Even if they didn't do it,
it turns out they most
likely witnessed it,

33:45.064 --> 33:46.690
so somebody
better talk
to them.

33:47.275 --> 33:50.277
Put out an APB and
see what we get back.
All right.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.780
Any reason to believe
they've left the state?

33:56.159 --> 33:57.576
That's certainly possible.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.787
<i>Hal, why don't</i>
<i>we go ahead and let</i>
<i>the Bureau in on this?</i>

34:11.549 --> 34:16.219
Louise, don't get mad, okay?
But where are we going?

34:16.304 --> 34:17.763
Oklahoma City.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.474
Jimmy's gonna
wire me some money
and then we're gonna...

34:20.558 --> 34:22.141
Jimmy? Did you
talk to him?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.478
Did you tell him?
What did he say?
Is he mad?

34:24.562 --> 34:26.563
No, I didn't tell him,
and that's what we
gotta get straight now.

34:26.647 --> 34:30.067
Darryl's been calling,
mad as a hornet,
making all kinds of noise.

34:30.860 --> 34:35.322
When you call him,
you gotta not tell him
anything about this.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.824
You gotta just make sure
everything sounds
real normal.

34:38.201 --> 34:41.078
You know,
I called the asshole
at 4:00 in the morning.

34:41.161 --> 34:42.579
He wasn't even home.

34:43.206 --> 34:45.748
I don't know what
he's got to be mad about.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.626
I'm the one that
should be mad.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.254
Thelma.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.549
I'm going to Mexico.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.967
Now, I figure I can make it
in two and a half days,

34:57.053 --> 34:58.845
but I'm gonna
have to haul ass.

35:00.223 --> 35:04.351
Are you up to this?
I mean, I gotta know.
This isn't a game.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.271
I'm in deep shit
and I gotta know
what you're gonna do.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.152
I don't know.
I don't know, Louise.

35:14.237 --> 35:16.113
I mean, I don't know
what you're asking.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.406
Now, don't you...
Don't you start
flaking out on me!

35:18.491 --> 35:20.826
God damn it, Thelma,
every time that
we get in trouble,

35:20.910 --> 35:25.580
you just get blank or...
Or plead insanity
or some such shit.

35:25.665 --> 35:29.126
Not this time.
I mean, this time
things have changed.

35:29.210 --> 35:30.836
Everything's changed.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.550
But I'm going to Mexico.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.885
I'm going.

36:18.551 --> 36:20.844
Louise?
<i>Is that the way</i>
<i>you answer the phone?</i>

36:22.054 --> 36:23.597
I was afraid
I'd missed you.

36:24.724 --> 36:29.144
I... I... I got it.
I was afraid I couldn't get
a check cashed on Saturday.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.520
Who did it?

36:31.105 --> 36:33.148
<i>A friend of mine</i>
<i>who owns a club.</i>
<i>Doug Randall.</i>

36:33.232 --> 36:34.941
You didn't tell him
what it's for, did you?

36:35.318 --> 36:37.986
No, I didn't say what
it was for. I told him
I was buying a car.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.281
Good. That's real good.
Listen, where do I go?

36:41.490 --> 36:43.450
It's a place called
the Vagabond Motel.

36:44.785 --> 36:47.996
It's at
1921 North East 23rd.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.790
It's under "Peaches."

36:51.125 --> 36:52.250
What?

36:55.963 --> 36:59.299
That's the code word.
I miss you, Peaches.

37:00.009 --> 37:02.844
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate it.

37:15.066 --> 37:18.944
Ma'am, you sure
you wouldn't rather have
a large economy size?

37:21.364 --> 37:22.906
No, no, that's okay.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.660
What are you looking at?

37:26.869 --> 37:28.245
Hey.
Hey.

37:28.496 --> 37:29.913
I want you to call Darryl.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.790
Call him?
Mmm-hmm.

37:31.874 --> 37:35.293
Tell him you're having
a wonderful time and
you'll be home tomorrow night.

37:35.378 --> 37:36.378
Will I be?

37:37.046 --> 37:38.380
I don't know.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.298
I won't.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.385
Ah! The newspaper.

37:58.526 --> 37:59.651
This is Darryl.

37:59.735 --> 38:02.529
I have
<i>a collect call from Thelma.</i>
<i>Will you accept?</i>

38:03.155 --> 38:04.948
Why, yes,
I will, operator.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.744
Thelma, where in
the Sam Hill are you?

38:09.870 --> 38:12.914
Um, I'm with Louise.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.959
We're...
We're in the mountains,
we're fishing.

38:16.043 --> 38:18.628
Have you lost
your mind?
Is that it?

38:18.713 --> 38:22.090
Now I leave for work,
and you take complete
leave of your senses?

38:22.300 --> 38:24.676
Darryl,
calm down, please.

38:25.344 --> 38:27.679
Don't get so mad.
I can explain, okay?

38:28.472 --> 38:29.556
See, Louise...

38:29.890 --> 38:31.391
Hold on! Hold on!

38:33.394 --> 38:34.686
Come on, Kurt, kick it.

38:34.770 --> 38:36.813
Kurt
<i>knocks the ball loose.</i>
Kick it.

38:36.939 --> 38:39.274
Shit! God!
<i>Kurt's got it.</i>
<i>He ends up with the ball.</i>

38:41.402 --> 38:42.652
Christ.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.321
We're just gonna stay
there and, you know,

38:44.405 --> 38:46.156
fish and hang out and stuff.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.782
We'll just be gone
one more day

38:47.867 --> 38:48.908
and then we'll be
home tomorrow night.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.202
No, you won't.
You'll be back today.

38:52.246 --> 38:54.622
You get your butt
back here, Thelma, now.

38:54.874 --> 38:56.166
God damn it!

38:57.251 --> 38:58.501
Darryl.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.422
Darryl?

39:02.965 --> 39:05.091
You're my husband,
not my father.

39:05.217 --> 39:06.593
Oh! Now, that does it.

39:07.094 --> 39:09.262
That Louise is nothing
but a bad influence!

39:10.306 --> 39:12.390
If you're not
back here by tonight,

39:15.436 --> 39:16.936
Thelma,

39:18.272 --> 39:21.191
well, then I just
don't wanna say.

39:23.277 --> 39:24.402
Darryl.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.279
Thelma.

39:27.281 --> 39:28.823
Go fuck yourself.

39:32.912 --> 39:34.871
Oh, that's good,
that's just sweet.

39:39.668 --> 39:40.877
Shit!
Sorry.

39:40.961 --> 39:42.879
Darling, you all right?
Are you okay?

39:42.963 --> 39:44.798
Did I cause that?
No, I'm sorry.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.549
No? You're okay?
Uh-huh.

39:46.967 --> 39:49.219
All right.
Is there something
I can do for you?

39:49.303 --> 39:50.637
No, it's okay.
Hmm?

39:56.602 --> 39:57.977
Crazy.

40:41.188 --> 40:42.272
Excuse me, ma'am.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.607
Uh... May I ask which
direction you're heading?

40:44.692 --> 40:47.694
See, I'm trying
to get back to school.
My ride fell through.

40:48.237 --> 40:50.280
Well, I'm kind of
stuck here like
stink on stink.

40:50.364 --> 40:53.032
So I was thinking
that if you're going my way

40:53.117 --> 40:55.285
or if I'm going
your way...

40:55.619 --> 40:57.704
I think we're going
to Oklahoma City,

40:57.788 --> 40:59.330
but I'm not sure.
Perfect.

40:59.415 --> 41:02.000
Yeah. Well,
I'd appreciate it much.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.751
Mmm.

41:03.836 --> 41:06.963
Well, see,
it's really not up to me.
It's not my car.

41:07.214 --> 41:08.465
Um...

41:08.549 --> 41:11.050
We'd have to ask my friend.

41:11.218 --> 41:14.596
But she'd probably say no.
She's a little bit uptight.

41:14.889 --> 41:16.639
Maybe it's not
such a good idea.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.142
But I'll tell you what,
I thank you for your time.

41:19.226 --> 41:21.144
But, you know,
I mean, I can ask,
you know.

41:21.228 --> 41:22.228
It wouldn't hurt nothing.

41:22.855 --> 41:24.689
Well, no,
it wouldn't hurt.

41:25.566 --> 41:26.566
Hey.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.569
Louise. Hey, Louise.

41:30.237 --> 41:32.697
This young man here's
on his way back to school

41:32.781 --> 41:35.617
and I thought
since we're going in
the same direction,

41:35.701 --> 41:37.785
you know, we could
give him a ride, huh?

41:41.540 --> 41:43.208
It's probably
not a good idea.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.502
Louise...

41:45.586 --> 41:47.795
No, probably not,
but I appreciate your time.

41:47.880 --> 41:50.423
You all have a good day,
all right? Drive safe.

41:50.549 --> 41:51.716
Louise?

41:58.015 --> 42:00.475
Did you see
how polite he is?
He was real sweet.

42:00.559 --> 42:01.935
Thelma.
What?

42:04.104 --> 42:05.605
Take care of
yourself, now.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.535
Fill her up.

42:19.286 --> 42:21.538
Sure wish we could have
brought him with us.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.290
What did Darryl
have to say?

42:25.459 --> 42:29.170
He said, "Okay, Thelma,
I just wanted to make
sure you was all right.

42:29.797 --> 42:31.381
"I sure hope
you're having fun.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.716
"You deserve it.
After all,
you put up with me.

42:33.801 --> 42:35.301
"I love you, honey."

42:41.684 --> 42:45.103
So, how long before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

43:06.250 --> 43:09.168
I just didn't
think it would hurt to
give somebody a ride.

43:09.753 --> 43:11.546
Did you see his butt?

43:12.548 --> 43:14.257
Darryl don't have
a cute butt.

43:14.758 --> 43:17.385
You could park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

43:18.137 --> 43:20.972
I'm sorry.
I'm just not in the mood
for company right now.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.104
Here, take this map.
I need you to find
all the secondary roads

43:28.188 --> 43:30.481
to Mexico from
Oklahoma City.

43:30.566 --> 43:33.234
I think we should
stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

43:35.571 --> 43:38.615
Looks like we could get
on this Road 81 here

43:38.949 --> 43:40.575
and head down towards Dallas.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.243
No, I don't want
to go through Texas.

43:42.328 --> 43:44.370
Find some way
we don't have to
go through there.

43:46.415 --> 43:47.540
Wait.

43:48.417 --> 43:52.545
What? You want
to go to Mexico
from Oklahoma,

43:52.630 --> 43:54.422
but you don't wanna
go through Texas?

43:55.007 --> 43:58.551
Thelma, you know
how I feel about Texas!
We're not going that way!

43:58.886 --> 44:01.971
Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're running
for our lives.

44:02.056 --> 44:03.765
I mean, can't you
make an exception?

44:03.849 --> 44:05.475
I mean, look at this map!

44:05.559 --> 44:08.728
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas.

44:08.812 --> 44:09.854
Look!

44:09.938 --> 44:11.689
Thelma, I'm not
gonna talk about this!

44:11.774 --> 44:14.984
Now, you either find
another way or give me
the goddamn map and I will!

44:15.069 --> 44:16.444
Do you understand?

44:16.528 --> 44:17.904
No, Louise, I don't.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.824
Now, how come
you never told me what
happened to you there?

44:26.580 --> 44:30.583
Look, you shoot off
a guy's head
with his pants down,

44:30.668 --> 44:33.461
believe me,
Texas is not the place
you wanna get caught.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.380
Now, trust me.

44:35.756 --> 44:38.174
Now, I've told you,
I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

45:16.588 --> 45:18.131
Happy birthday, lady.

45:20.092 --> 45:23.094
<i>You know, you could</i>
<i>have been a cuckoo</i>

45:23.178 --> 45:26.222
<i>And, baby, you're so smart</i>

45:27.099 --> 45:30.059
<i>You know you could</i>
<i>have been a schoolbook</i>

45:30.936 --> 45:35.648
<i>Well, you could have been</i>
<i>anything that you wanted to</i>

45:35.733 --> 45:38.568
<i>And I can tell</i>

45:38.652 --> 45:44.615
<i>The way you do</i>
<i>the things you do</i>

46:01.842 --> 46:03.384
Is the manager in?

46:04.011 --> 46:06.596
Marian, there's
a police officer here.

46:29.203 --> 46:31.412
All right. All right,
Thelma. All right.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.040
Okay.

47:05.113 --> 47:08.574
The other night
there was a murder out
at the Silver Bullet.

47:09.493 --> 47:10.743
A man was shot.

47:11.703 --> 47:13.996
And we have some
witnesses that saw

47:14.081 --> 47:18.125
a 1966 T-Bird convertible
leaving the scene,

47:19.002 --> 47:21.254
sort of speeding out
of the driveway there.

47:21.588 --> 47:24.924
And that vehicle
is registered
to one Louise Sawyer.

47:26.426 --> 47:28.886
And we have
reason to believe
that your wife was

47:29.513 --> 47:31.848
the other occupant
of that car.

47:33.559 --> 47:41.107
What?

47:41.900 --> 47:43.067
Excuse me.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.444
You're standing
in your pizza.

47:46.238 --> 47:47.363
Shit!

47:48.866 --> 47:51.701
So, tell me something,
Ms. Thelma. How is it
you ain't got any kids?

47:51.785 --> 47:53.160
I mean, God gives you
something special,

47:53.245 --> 47:54.954
I think you ought
to pass it on.

47:56.123 --> 47:59.333
Well, Darryl,
that's my husband...
Darryl?

47:59.418 --> 48:01.544
Yeah. He says
he's not ready yet.

48:01.628 --> 48:04.046
He says he's still
too much of a kid himself.

48:04.131 --> 48:06.507
Kind of prides himself
on being infantile.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.050
He's got a lot
to be proud of.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.552
Louise and him
don't get along.

48:09.636 --> 48:11.137
That's
putting it mildly.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.221
She thinks he's a pig.

48:12.306 --> 48:13.806
I know he's a pig.

48:15.142 --> 48:17.310
Did you get married
real young, Ms. Thelma?

48:18.145 --> 48:20.104
Well, I guess
18's kind of young.

48:22.858 --> 48:26.152
But we'd already been
going out four years
when we got married.

48:26.862 --> 48:28.654
Out for how long?
Four years.

48:29.656 --> 48:31.782
I never been with
anybody but Darryl.

48:32.492 --> 48:33.743
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:33.827 --> 48:36.954
Well, if you don't
mind me saying so,

48:37.039 --> 48:38.831
he sounds like
a real asshole.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.001
It's okay.

48:42.336 --> 48:45.838
He is an asshole.
Most of the time,
I just let it slide.

48:48.842 --> 48:51.677
You better slow down
there, Ms. Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

48:52.512 --> 48:53.679
Shit.

49:29.508 --> 49:32.301
Maybe you got a few
too many parking tickets.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.095
We'll take you
to Oklahoma City,

49:34.179 --> 49:35.805
then you best be
on your way, all right?

49:35.889 --> 49:37.223
All right.

49:44.606 --> 49:48.067
Prints on the trunk
of the car match those
of Thelma Dickinson.

49:48.485 --> 49:50.569
I'll be damned.
Isn't that strange?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.863
And the husband says
a gun is missing.

49:53.657 --> 49:55.366
She took a lot of stuff.

49:56.201 --> 49:59.412
It looks like
she may be planning on
being gone a while.

49:59.496 --> 50:01.122
The strange thing is

50:01.581 --> 50:04.750
her husband said
she would never
touch that gun.

50:05.502 --> 50:08.546
He got it for her
'cause he's out late a lot,

50:09.339 --> 50:12.883
but he said
she'd never touch it,
wouldn't learn to shoot it.

50:12.968 --> 50:14.677
Just kept it in
a drawer for years.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.053
What kind of gun was it?

50:16.138 --> 50:17.263
.38.

50:17.347 --> 50:19.015
Right. Where are they?

50:19.099 --> 50:22.810
They were on their way
to some guy's cabin
and they never showed up.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.691
All right. Now,
I'm gonna go and...

50:28.775 --> 50:31.193
Listen up, you two.
I'm gonna go in. It's
just gonna take a minute.

50:31.278 --> 50:34.071
You two better
say your goodbyes,
you understand?

50:34.156 --> 50:35.448
Okay.

50:40.662 --> 50:41.871
Hi.
Hi.

50:41.955 --> 50:44.623
I'm here to pick up
a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

50:47.961 --> 50:49.336
There's nothing.

50:50.380 --> 50:53.799
How about "Peaches"?
Could you try
code word "Peaches"?

50:54.134 --> 50:56.635
Did I hear somebody
say "Peaches"?

50:57.262 --> 50:58.637
Oh, my God. Jimmy.

50:58.805 --> 51:00.681
That's the secret word.

51:01.767 --> 51:03.517
Show the lady
what she's won, Don.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.480
What are you doing here?

51:07.814 --> 51:09.565
I just came
to see you, baby.

51:12.152 --> 51:13.444
Can I have
another room, please?

51:13.528 --> 51:15.488
Put it on
my credit card.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.041
Thelma? Thelma,
get your foot down.

51:27.125 --> 51:28.751
Thelma, look who's here.

51:29.002 --> 51:32.254
Oh! Shit! Jimmy.
Hi, stranger.

51:32.672 --> 51:34.256
What in the world
are you doing here?

51:34.341 --> 51:37.176
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.179
Good answer.
Same goes
double for me.

51:41.014 --> 51:42.098
Who's the cowboy?

51:42.182 --> 51:44.350
This here...
This is J. D.
How'd do?

51:44.434 --> 51:46.143
He's a student.
He's gone.

51:46.228 --> 51:49.230
We're just giving him
a ride to here, then he...

51:49.356 --> 51:51.774
Louise said that
he would have to go, so...
He's gone.

51:51.858 --> 51:53.192
I guess that's
what he's doing.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.693
Yeah, I reckon
that's what I'm doing.

51:54.778 --> 51:56.153
He's gone.
Like the wind.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.239
Have a good trip.
Thank you.

51:58.323 --> 51:59.782
Nice meeting you.

52:01.660 --> 52:02.660
Yep.

52:02.953 --> 52:06.122
Yep, that's him going.
I love watching him go.

52:06.206 --> 52:07.957
Thelma kind of
took to him.

52:08.041 --> 52:10.793
Yeah, well,
I got you a room there,
Thelma.

52:10.877 --> 52:13.379
You can go on in
and take yourself
a nice cold shower.

52:13.463 --> 52:16.382
Well,
you know me, Jimmy,
I'm just a wild woman.

52:29.396 --> 52:30.813
It's our future.

52:40.740 --> 52:42.324
What are you
gonna tell him?

52:43.451 --> 52:44.743
Nothing.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.538
I'm not gonna
tell him a thing.

52:48.331 --> 52:50.499
The least I can do
is not make him
any more of an accessory

52:50.584 --> 52:51.959
than he already is.

52:52.169 --> 52:55.296
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you really are.

52:55.380 --> 52:57.673
Imagine not wanting
to drag him into this.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.425
I didn't ask him to come.

52:59.551 --> 53:01.552
It's like I said,
he's no different
than any other guy.

53:01.636 --> 53:02.761
He just loves
the chase is all.

53:03.930 --> 53:07.224
Well, he sure got
his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

53:07.309 --> 53:08.976
Thelma, just
put a lid on it!

53:11.771 --> 53:13.022
Now...

53:14.649 --> 53:17.193
I want you to just...
You guard that money.

53:18.028 --> 53:19.153
Okay.

53:19.571 --> 53:23.490
And if there's any problem,
then you call me in Room 211.

53:24.910 --> 53:25.993
Okay.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.495
I won't wait up.

53:46.973 --> 53:48.474
You want a drink?
No.

53:50.727 --> 53:52.645
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

53:54.689 --> 53:57.066
I'm not gonna tell you
what's going on.

53:57.150 --> 53:59.068
Someday soon
you'll understand
why I can't,

53:59.152 --> 54:00.861
but I'm not going to,
so don't ask me.

54:05.033 --> 54:07.701
Can I ask you
one thing?
Maybe.

54:08.787 --> 54:10.162
Are you in love
with somebody else?

54:11.164 --> 54:13.666
Does this
have something to do
with another man?

54:14.084 --> 54:16.168
No, it's not
anything like that.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.048
Then what is it,
God damn it?

54:22.008 --> 54:24.218
Are you just gonna leave
for fucking ever?

54:25.720 --> 54:27.805
What, did you fucking
kill somebody?

54:27.889 --> 54:29.515
You start this shit,
I'm out of here!

54:34.688 --> 54:35.854
I'm sorry.

54:37.607 --> 54:40.150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:42.153 --> 54:43.612
You wanna come
back over there
and sit down?

54:43.697 --> 54:45.489
I wanna give you something.

54:45.573 --> 54:46.949
I'm fine right here.

54:47.033 --> 54:48.117
I wanna
give you something.

54:48.201 --> 54:49.702
Give it to me here.

54:54.708 --> 54:55.874
Here.

55:07.178 --> 55:09.138
Why don't you try it on?

55:12.392 --> 55:14.727
You didn't see
that one coming,
did you?

55:16.062 --> 55:17.229
Why, Jimmy?

55:20.150 --> 55:21.191
Why now?

55:23.862 --> 55:25.612
Try not to get
too excited, Louise.

55:25.697 --> 55:30.284
I just flew across
two states with that ring
in my fucking hand and...

55:32.912 --> 55:34.621
You know I hate to fly.

55:37.000 --> 55:41.045
You came all this way
because you thought
I was with somebody else.

55:44.049 --> 55:46.008
No, that's not
why I came.

55:49.763 --> 55:52.723
Because, you know, I...
I don't want to lose you.

55:53.475 --> 55:57.227
And I get the feeling
like you're gonna,
like, split permanently.

55:57.312 --> 55:59.396
That's not a good
reason to get married.

56:01.483 --> 56:02.941
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted.

56:04.527 --> 56:05.819
I did,

56:07.405 --> 56:08.947
but not like this.

56:09.199 --> 56:11.658
Cooking methods.
<i>Questions are encouraged.</i>

56:21.086 --> 56:22.878
No, Thelma,
it's me.

56:24.339 --> 56:25.547
Surprise.

56:27.092 --> 56:29.968
I was just out there
and I was thinking that...

56:30.053 --> 56:33.138
Well, I know I'm supposed
to be gone and all, but...

56:33.890 --> 56:34.932
You know.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.688
And I'm not having
a turd's luck getting
a ride out in this rain.

56:43.024 --> 56:45.025
I was just
thinking about you.

56:49.614 --> 56:51.156
This... This is crazy.

56:51.241 --> 56:53.575
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of
your hair, all right?

56:53.660 --> 56:54.660
I'm gonna...

56:54.744 --> 56:57.162
Well, wait, wait.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.665
Where you going?

57:02.961 --> 57:06.213
Ah, I don't know.
You know, nowhere.

57:06.798 --> 57:10.092
You think I'm happy
playing my one-night gigs
in Ramada Inn lounges?

57:10.176 --> 57:12.845
You know, you think
you're the only one with
dreams that don't work out?

57:12.929 --> 57:15.055
We both got
what we settled for.

57:15.598 --> 57:18.100
I think maybe you just
don't love me anymore.

57:18.184 --> 57:19.643
No, I do love you.

57:24.190 --> 57:26.567
But I think
it's time to just

57:28.862 --> 57:30.737
let go of
the old mistakes.

57:33.074 --> 57:34.950
Just chalk it up to

57:36.870 --> 57:38.287
bad timing.

57:40.498 --> 57:42.374
I think it's time
to let go.

57:45.086 --> 57:47.254
Look out. Look out.
Don't... Don't do it.

57:47.338 --> 57:48.922
Oh! Oh! Oh!

57:49.299 --> 57:50.466
Come on.

57:50.842 --> 57:51.967
You're too easy.
Come on. Here.

57:52.051 --> 57:53.093
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

57:53.178 --> 57:54.303
Your turn.

57:55.221 --> 57:56.513
Come on.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.391
Well, don't leave it...
Just don't leave them there.

57:59.476 --> 58:00.476
All right, all right.

58:02.729 --> 58:04.146
Gosh, what are you...

58:04.898 --> 58:06.398
You see, this is
an unfair advantage.

58:06.483 --> 58:09.401
You got...
You got too much
metal going here.

58:10.236 --> 58:13.113
You want to lighten
the load a little bit?
Yeah?

58:15.492 --> 58:16.492
Yeah.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.620
I think that's better.
What do you think?

58:19.704 --> 58:21.371
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

58:24.125 --> 58:26.210
Take me, break me,
make me a man!
You're gonna hit your head!

58:26.294 --> 58:27.836
Watch your head! Careful.

58:27.921 --> 58:29.338
My head's fine.

58:29.422 --> 58:31.256
Who are you, anyway?

58:33.551 --> 58:36.678
I'm the great
and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

58:36.763 --> 58:39.848
Come on, tell me.
I know you're not
just some schoolboy.

58:39.933 --> 58:41.391
Nobody ever
tells me shit.
Tell me.

58:41.476 --> 58:43.268
Oh, I'm just some guy.

58:43.603 --> 58:47.564
A guy whose parole officer
is probably having
a shit fit right about now.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.775
What do you mean,
parole officer?

58:50.735 --> 58:52.277
What? Are you a criminal?

58:52.362 --> 58:54.780
No. No,
not no more, Thelma.

58:55.949 --> 58:56.949
Let's see.

58:57.033 --> 58:59.076
Besides busting parole,
I haven't done
one wrong thing.

58:59.994 --> 59:01.537
What'd you do?

59:01.621 --> 59:02.704
I'm a robber.

59:03.873 --> 59:04.873
You're a bank robber?

59:04.958 --> 59:06.375
No. No.

59:06.459 --> 59:08.794
I don't rob no banks.
Come on.

59:09.295 --> 59:10.754
What'd you rob?

59:11.881 --> 59:13.257
Hmm.

59:13.800 --> 59:15.842
Well, let's see.

59:15.927 --> 59:17.553
Let's add it up here,

59:17.637 --> 59:20.597
I robbed a gas station,

59:20.682 --> 59:23.850
a couple of
convenience stores,
liquor stores.

59:25.520 --> 59:26.979
Oh, my God.

59:28.773 --> 59:29.856
How?

59:31.776 --> 59:33.527
Come on.

59:33.611 --> 59:34.736
Okay.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.239
Well, see, first you pick
your place, all right?

59:37.323 --> 59:39.533
Then I just sit back
and watch it
for a little while.

59:39.617 --> 59:42.286
Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

59:42.370 --> 59:45.956
That's something
you gotta know up here.
That shit cannot be taught.

59:46.040 --> 59:50.043
Yeah, then...
Shit, I don't want
to talk about this.

59:50.128 --> 59:51.920
Come on, I do.

59:53.840 --> 59:55.048
All right.

59:55.675 --> 59:59.094
Then I'd waltz right in.

59:59.512 --> 01:00:00.596
Yeah.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.640
And I'd just kind of
waltz on in and I'd say,

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:07.102
"Ladies, gentlemen,
let's see who wins a prize
for keeping their cool.

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.438
"Simon says,
'Everybody down
on the floor.'

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.608
"Now, nobody loses
their head, then
nobody loses their head.

01:00:12.734 --> 01:00:15.986
"Uh... You, sir. Yeah,
you do the honors.

01:00:16.529 --> 01:00:18.363
"Take that cash
and put it into
that bag right there.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.407
"You've got an amazing story
to tell your friends.

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:23.201
"If not, well,
you got a tag on your toe.
You decide."

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.371
Simple as that.

01:00:27.415 --> 01:00:29.124
Then I'd just slip on out.

01:00:30.335 --> 01:00:33.670
And get the hell
out of Dodge, yeah.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.089
Mmm-hmm.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:39.718
My goodness.
You were sure
gentlemanly about it.

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:42.679
Well, now,
I've always believed
that, done properly,

01:00:42.764 --> 01:00:46.308
armed robbery doesn't
have to be a totally
unpleasant experience.

01:00:48.394 --> 01:00:50.896
What?
You're a real live
outlaw, aren't you?

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:56.276
Well, I may be an outlaw,
darling, but you're the one
who's stealing my heart.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.696
You're smooth.
Oh. Yeah. Oh.

01:00:59.781 --> 01:01:02.491
Isn't he? Isn't he?
You're smooth. Yeah.

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:03.575
That's right.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:04.951
Keep it that way.

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:06.703
I'll pin you.

01:01:12.418 --> 01:01:14.086
Remember when
we first met?

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:17.130
Yeah.

01:01:18.966 --> 01:01:20.926
What happened?
Tell me what you said.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.220
I said you had
a nice pair of eyes.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.308
And what'd I say?
Do you remember?

01:01:31.771 --> 01:01:36.108
Yeah, you shut them.
Asked me if I knew
what color they were.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.277
And what'd you say?

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.781
I didn't know.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.371
Jimmy, what color
are my eyes?

01:01:53.584 --> 01:01:55.168
They're brown.

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:38.336
Wait. Wait.

01:02:38.796 --> 01:02:41.298
<i>Night upon the rocks</i>

01:02:41.382 --> 01:02:43.717
<i>I'm over by the roadhouse</i>

01:02:43.801 --> 01:02:46.428
<i>With them rusted</i>

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.805
<i>A ghost town</i>
<i>with a gold mine</i>

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:51.016
<i>A pick axe in my head</i>

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:53.643
<i>I'm beggin'</i>

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.855

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.159

<i>With them jewels</i>

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.456
<i>Eyes on my lever now</i>

<i>She paint with chili sauce</i>

01:03:16.709 --> 01:03:19.294

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.220
Y'all want
some more coffee?

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:12.556
Thank you.

01:04:21.983 --> 01:04:24.860
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,
or what happened

01:04:24.944 --> 01:04:27.195
or what you all did,

01:04:28.948 --> 01:04:30.699
but I'm not gonna tell
anybody anything,

01:04:30.783 --> 01:04:33.410
and I'm not gonna say
that I even saw you.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.455
Okay?

01:04:37.748 --> 01:04:38.874
Damn, Jimmy,
what did you do,

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:41.918
take some kind of pill
that makes you say
all the right stuff?

01:04:45.172 --> 01:04:47.591
Yeah, I'm choking on it.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.139
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:58.894
I think it's probably not
a real good idea right now.

01:04:59.812 --> 01:05:04.733
But I'll catch up
with you later
on down the road.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.278
Yeah.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.159
Well,

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:16.703
my taxi's here.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:24.002
So, why don't you
just keep that?

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.756
Okay?
Thanks.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:31.843
I just want you
to be happy.

01:05:33.179 --> 01:05:36.765
I am happy, sweetie.
Happy as I can be.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:40.685
All right.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:43.688
All right.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:47.442
Well, why don't you give
old Jimmy a kiss goodbye?

01:05:48.235 --> 01:05:50.820
And I'll be getting
out of here.

01:05:54.867 --> 01:05:56.242
Come here,
old Jimmy.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.030
I'll be seeing you,
Louise.
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:41.246
Okay, have a safe trip.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:57.679
It's a good thing
he left when he did.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.682
We thought we were gonna
have to put out a fire.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:15.321
Hi.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:17.365
What happened
to your hair?

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.617
Nothing.
Got messed up.

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:22.996
Thelma, what's
wrong with you?

01:07:23.956 --> 01:07:27.292
Nothing. Why,
do I seem different?

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.712
Well, now that
you mention it, yeah.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:34.340
You seem like you're crazy
or you're on drugs.

01:07:35.634 --> 01:07:39.804
Well, I'm not on drugs,
but I might be crazy!

01:07:45.269 --> 01:07:46.686
Thelma, what happened?

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.275
What happened?
J. D. Came back.

01:07:52.359 --> 01:07:54.069
Oh, my God, Louise.
Oh, my God.

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.278
Oh, no!
I can't believe it.

01:07:55.362 --> 01:07:58.031
I mean, I just
can't believe it!
No!

01:07:58.115 --> 01:07:59.991
Oh, my God, it's like...

01:08:01.619 --> 01:08:03.787
I finally understand
what all the fuss is about!

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.581
Now it's just like
a whole other ball game.

01:08:06.665 --> 01:08:10.960
Darling, I'm so happy for you.
That's great. I really am.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:14.172
You finally
got laid properly.
That's so sweet.

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:17.591
Where is he now?

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.176
He's taking a shower.

01:08:21.596 --> 01:08:23.765
Thelma, you left him
alone in the room?

01:08:26.852 --> 01:08:28.435
Where's the money?
Oh, my God.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.770
Thelma, where's the money?

01:08:29.854 --> 01:08:31.689
It's on the bed table.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:33.399
It's okay.

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:38.988
It's on the nightstand!
It's okay.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.330
Oh, God damn it!

01:08:48.165 --> 01:08:50.834
I've never been lucky!
Not one time!

01:08:52.627 --> 01:08:53.877
Shit!

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.381
That son of a bitch
burned me.
I don't believe it.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.384
I don't believe it.

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:04.346
Louise?

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:07.725
You okay?

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.020
Louise.

01:09:14.942 --> 01:09:16.484
I'm sorry, I mean it.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.033
Louise, it's okay.

01:09:26.871 --> 01:09:27.953
It's okay.

01:09:28.037 --> 01:09:30.247
No, Thelma,
it's not okay.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:32.750
It's definitely not okay.

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:36.880
None of this is okay.

01:09:37.965 --> 01:09:41.759
I mean,
what are we gonna
do for money, huh?

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:46.848
How we gonna get gas?
I mean, trading
on our good looks?

01:09:48.642 --> 01:09:53.313
I mean, oh, God damn it,
Thelma, it's not okay.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:09:59.861
Louise.

01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.447
Hey, now you listen to me.

01:10:03.782 --> 01:10:04.782
Don't you worry about it.

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:09.704
You hear me?
Come on, stand up!

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:15.960
Louise, just don't you
worry about it. You hear?

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:17.754
Come on.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.966
Come on, damn it!

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:24.135
Get your stuff
and let's get out
of here.

01:10:25.638 --> 01:10:28.306
Move! Jesus Christ,
come on.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:30.183
Come on.

01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:35.271
Take your damn time.
Come on, here we go.

01:10:57.878 --> 01:10:59.003
Damn, damn.

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:06.135
Afraid of a little
rain, Max?

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:07.595
Phew!

01:11:10.891 --> 01:11:13.268
Well, come on in.
Wipe your feet.

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:31.202
As you know,
we've tapped your phone in
the event that she calls in.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:34.205
Is that gonna cost me?

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.623
Excuse me, may I?

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:38.418
Hey, live it up.
That's what
it's there for.

01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:41.296
We're going to have
someone here at the house

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.423
on the phones
until we find them.

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:47.302
The important thing is
not to let on that
you know anything.

01:11:47.678 --> 01:11:49.470
We want to try
and find out
where they are.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:50.596
Uh-huh.

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.432
I don't want to
get too personal,

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:55.435
but do you have
a good relationship
with your wife?

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:58.855
I... I love Thelma.

01:12:00.566 --> 01:12:02.692
I don't intend
anything by that, sir.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:06.070
It's just a question
I have to ask.
Are you close with her?

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.323
Yeah. I guess.

01:12:08.782 --> 01:12:12.702
I mean, I'm about
as close as I can be
to a nutcase like that.

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:21.836
Yeah, well,
if she calls,
just be gentle.

01:12:23.088 --> 01:12:25.631
You know, like
you're really happy
to hear from her.

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:28.259
Like you really miss her.

01:12:28.802 --> 01:12:29.886
Women love that shit.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:35.516
Okay, if you say so.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.523
- "Women love that shit."
- I'm sorry, it's just...

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.498
Cool. Can I
wear these?

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:07.423
Want anything?

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.319
Drive, Louise!

01:14:10.612 --> 01:14:12.530
Drive! Drive the car!

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.494
Go! Go!

01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:20.079
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:24.459
What happened?

01:14:25.752 --> 01:14:27.086
You robbed the store?

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:29.380
You robbed
the goddamn store?

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.923
Well, we needed the money.

01:14:31.717 --> 01:14:33.676
It's not like
I killed anybody,
for God's sake.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760
Thelma!

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.054
I'm sorry.
We needed the money,
now we have it.

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:40.308
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, Thelma!

01:14:40.392 --> 01:14:41.559
Louise. Louise.
Oh, shit!

01:14:41.643 --> 01:14:44.604
Come on, get a grip.
Drive us to goddamn
Mexico, will you?

01:14:44.688 --> 01:14:45.771
Okay.

01:14:46.064 --> 01:14:47.982
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:14:49.234 --> 01:14:52.862
Well, how... How'd you...
I mean, what'd you say?

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:56.491
Well, I just waltzed on
in there and I said...

01:14:56.575 --> 01:14:58.951
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>This is a robbery.</i>

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.537
<i>Now,</i>
<i>if nobody loses their head,</i>
<i>nobody'll lose their head.</i>

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:04.665
<i>Simon says, "Y'all lie down</i>
<i>on the floor, please,</i>
<i>right away."</i>

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.502
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Ma'am, would you get</i>
<i>down? Not you, sir.</i>

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.837
<i>Let's see who'll win a prize</i>
<i>for keeping their cool.</i>

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.255
<i>Sir, would you</i>
<i>do the honors?</i>

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.299
<i>Take all the cash</i>
<i>out of the drawer,</i>
<i>put it in a paper bag.</i>

01:15:13.383 --> 01:15:14.342
Yes, ma'am.

01:15:14.426 --> 01:15:16.761
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>an amazing story</i>
<i>to tell all your friends.</i>

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.347
<i>If not, you'll have</i>
<i>a tag on your toe.</i>
<i>You decide.</i>

01:15:20.474 --> 01:15:22.308
<i>Hurry up. Let's go.</i>

01:15:23.602 --> 01:15:25.394
<i>Ma'am, would you be quiet?</i>
<i>Sir, get down, please.</i>

01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.021
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Just stay there.</i>

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.398
<i>Just get real comfortable.</i>

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.653
<i>Hey, throw in some</i>
<i>bottles of Wild Turkey,</i>
<i>too, will you?</i>

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:34.820
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:38.991
<i>Thank you. Now,</i>
<i>you get down, too.</i>
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:42.578
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I want to thank you all</i>
<i>for your cooperation.</i>

01:15:42.663 --> 01:15:45.790
<i>Now, stay down</i>
<i>on the floor till I'm gone.</i>
<i>Have a good day.</i>

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:50.127
Jesus Christ!

01:15:50.462 --> 01:15:51.879
Good God.

01:15:51.964 --> 01:15:53.089
My Lord.

01:16:03.141 --> 01:16:06.435
Hey, Louise,
better slow down.

01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:09.397
I'd just die
if we get caught over
a speeding ticket.

01:16:09.481 --> 01:16:12.733
You know, for the
first time in my life,
I wish this car wasn't green.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.112
You sure we should
be driving like this?

01:16:16.196 --> 01:16:17.321
I mean,
in broad daylight
and everything?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.907
No, we shouldn't,
but I want to put
some distance between us

01:16:19.992 --> 01:16:22.577
and the scene of
our last goddamn crime!

01:16:26.498 --> 01:16:29.584
Oh, man!
You wouldn't
have believed it.

01:16:29.668 --> 01:16:31.794
It was like I'd been
doing it all my life.

01:16:31.878 --> 01:16:33.671
I mean, nobody
would believe it.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.924
Think you found
your calling?

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.884
Maybe. Maybe.

01:16:38.969 --> 01:16:40.428
The call of the wild!

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.474
You are disturbed!

01:16:45.559 --> 01:16:47.351
Yeah, I believe I am.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.894
Whoo!

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.535
Thelma, don't you litter.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.040
Wait a minute. Shoot.

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:12.209
God, I hate when you...
This always happens
when you're in a hurry.

01:17:13.253 --> 01:17:16.464
Damn. What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk all day?

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.383
Try to.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:27.767
Oh. Isn't that nice?
Truck drivers
are always so nice.

01:17:27.851 --> 01:17:29.352
Best drivers on the road.

01:17:34.107 --> 01:17:37.401
Oh, Lord.
How original.

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:48.704
Thank you.

01:17:50.248 --> 01:17:52.333
Oh, man!
That's disgusting!

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:54.627
You pig!
Just a fucking pig!

01:17:54.711 --> 01:17:56.045
That's gross!
What's he gotta do
that for, anyway?

01:17:56.129 --> 01:17:57.463
I don't know.

01:17:58.632 --> 01:18:00.424
They think we like it.

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.052
They think it turns us on
is what they think.

01:18:03.136 --> 01:18:04.261
Shut up!

01:18:42.008 --> 01:18:43.300
James Lennox?

01:18:44.428 --> 01:18:45.553
Yeah, who wants to know?

01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:46.929
Arkansas State Police.

01:19:22.174 --> 01:19:23.340
Hi.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.173
Thelma.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:08.594
What?

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:10.054
I want you to call Darryl.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:12.807
What for?

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.855
I want you to find out
if he knows anything.

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.566
If you think he does,
you gotta hang up the phone,

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:24.235
'cause that means
the police have told him,

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:26.529
and the phone's
probably tapped.

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:29.865
Tapped the phone?
What are you
talking about?

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:32.910
Come on, Thelma,
murder one
and armed robbery?

01:20:32.994 --> 01:20:35.579
Murder one?
We can't even say
it was self-defense?

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:37.665
Well, it wasn't.
We were walking away.
We got away.

01:20:37.749 --> 01:20:39.250
Yeah, but they
don't know that.

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:41.085
It was just you
and me there.

01:20:41.169 --> 01:20:42.586
I'll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.213
That's almost the truth.

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:46.549
It won't work.
Why not?

01:20:46.633 --> 01:20:49.552
Because there's
no physical evidence.
We can't prove he did it.

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:52.805
We can't even
probably prove by now
that he touched you.

01:20:54.266 --> 01:20:55.432
God.

01:20:56.101 --> 01:20:58.811
Law is some tricky
shit, isn't it?

01:21:02.732 --> 01:21:04.358
Hey, how do you know
about all this stuff
anyway?

01:21:04.442 --> 01:21:06.402
Besides,
what're we gonna say
about the robbery?

01:21:06.486 --> 01:21:07.695
There's no excuse for that.

01:21:07.779 --> 01:21:10.030
There's no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:13.117
All right, Louise,
will you?
Where'd you get this?

01:21:14.452 --> 01:21:15.619
Stole it.

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:29.008
Hi.

01:21:29.801 --> 01:21:30.926
Hi!

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:32.720
Huh!

01:21:34.681 --> 01:21:36.223
Who's the nut?

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:37.808
That's Mrs. Dickinson's
husband.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:38.934
Excuse me.

01:21:39.227 --> 01:21:41.812
Well, shit twice
and fall back in it.

01:21:42.355 --> 01:21:43.480
God.

01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.402
Where'd you get
the $6,600 in cash?

01:21:50.697 --> 01:21:51.864
A friend.

01:21:52.324 --> 01:21:54.742
We spoke
with a gentleman today
who says he delivered

01:21:54.826 --> 01:21:57.328
very close
to that same amount to
a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

01:21:57.412 --> 01:21:58.913
Do you know her, too?

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:01.498
Yes, sir.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:04.543
Yeah, I believe
she's the woman
driving the car.

01:22:05.837 --> 01:22:08.923
He said he took it
to a motel
in Oklahoma City.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.634
He also says
that at that time
he met a man.

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.345
He identified you
through a series
of mug shots.

01:22:15.555 --> 01:22:18.933
He also told us that
you and Mrs. Dickinson
seemed close.

01:22:19.392 --> 01:22:20.809
Is that true?

01:22:22.103 --> 01:22:23.187
Well, sir,

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:26.941
you might say
we had a meeting of
the minds, yeah.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:30.694
Are you aware
that Mrs. Dickinson
and Ms. Sawyer

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.571
are wanted
in connection
with a murder?

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.532
Murder? What,
Thelma? Damn!

01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:38.535
Did they ever indicate
that they might be
on the run from the law?

01:22:40.413 --> 01:22:42.289
You know, sir,
now that you mention it,

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.958
they might have
seemed a little bit jumpy.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:47.336
You know what?
What?

01:22:48.171 --> 01:22:49.964
You're starting
to irritate me.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:51.382
Yeah, me, too.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.384
That'll happen.

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:55.761
Say, you two boys
have a lot in common.

01:22:55.845 --> 01:22:58.180
Maybe I should
just step out
of the room for a sec.

01:23:01.518 --> 01:23:02.726
I got a better idea.

01:23:05.271 --> 01:23:07.147
Do you mind if
I speak to him alone
for a minute?

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:29.169
What? What'd I do?
Nothing, that's what.

01:23:29.254 --> 01:23:33.507
Tell you something,
this is a crock of shit,
Mr. John fucking Law.

01:23:41.558 --> 01:23:43.600
Son, I got a feeling
about something and...

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.685
Yeah?

01:23:44.769 --> 01:23:46.687
...I just wanna
ask your opinion.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:51.608
Do you think Thelma Dickinson
would have committed
armed robbery

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.610
if you hadn't taken
all their money?

01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:57.740
Get your foot
off that table.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:04.538
Cat got your tongue?

01:24:04.622 --> 01:24:05.664
No.

01:24:06.624 --> 01:24:08.083
Well, how... How do
you know I took it?

01:24:08.668 --> 01:24:10.169
How do you know
they didn't...

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:13.213
Don't you fucking
lie to me!

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:18.093
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.
They had a chance.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.763
And now you've
screwed it up for them.
No.

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:22.890
And now they're in
some serious trouble.

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.142
And I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:27.311
for at least part of it
if anything happens to them.

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:30.147
I got no feeling for you.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:33.233
Now, you're either
gonna tell me every
damn thing you know,

01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:36.070
so there's a small chance
that I can actually
do them some good,

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:40.991
or I'm gonna be all over you
like a fly on shit for the
rest of your natural life.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.827
Your miseries will be
my goddamn mission in life.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:45.704
Yes, sir.

01:24:47.957 --> 01:24:50.542
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
That's right.

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:51.752
We understand each other?

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:53.170
Yeah.
Okay.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:24:59.343
Mr. Dickinson?
Yeah?

01:24:59.886 --> 01:25:02.304
If you'd just hang on,
I want a word with you.

01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:04.515
I like your wife.

01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.518
Come back here!

01:25:07.727 --> 01:25:08.769
Hey, hey!

01:25:08.853 --> 01:25:10.854
Come back here,
you little shit!

01:25:12.690 --> 01:25:14.149
Come here! Come here!
All right, all right,
all right.

01:25:14.234 --> 01:25:16.610
Come here!
Come here!
Come on!

01:25:16.694 --> 01:25:18.320
Come on, now.
I'll kill him!

01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:20.114
Let's
go home now.
I'll kill you!

01:25:43.263 --> 01:25:44.805
What will it be,
ladies?

01:25:44.889 --> 01:25:46.557
Fill her up.
There you go.

01:25:47.225 --> 01:25:48.559
Um...

01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:52.604
Excuse me,
do you have a phone?

01:25:55.358 --> 01:25:56.817
Thank you.

01:25:57.068 --> 01:25:58.318
Thelma,
listen up, now.

01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:00.988
If you even think
he knows, I mean,
even if you're not sure,

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:03.157
I want you to hang up,
you understand?

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:04.324
Yeah.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:43.447
Hello.

01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:45.282
Darryl, it's me.

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:46.700
Thelma, hello!

01:26:49.954 --> 01:26:50.996
He knows.
Shit.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:52.831
I need more time.

01:26:55.668 --> 01:26:58.503
What? All I said
was "hello."

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:23.695
Yep?

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.031
Darryl,
<i>this is Louise.</i>
<i>Let me talk to the police.</i>

01:27:26.115 --> 01:27:27.866
Hey, Louise.
<i>Hi.</i>

01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:31.161
<i>Let me talk to the police.</i>

01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:34.706
What do you mean?
There's no police here.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:37.209
Hey, where
are you girls anyway?

01:27:37.293 --> 01:27:40.087
<i>Just wait... Darryl,</i>
<i>will you let me talk to</i>
<i>whoever's in charge there?</i>

01:27:40.171 --> 01:27:41.880
How do you know
there's...

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.341
Hello, Ms. Sawyer?

01:27:45.009 --> 01:27:48.887
I'm Investigator Hal Slocumb,
Arkansas State Police.

01:27:48.972 --> 01:27:50.013
How are you?

01:27:50.348 --> 01:27:52.099
Well, I've been better.

01:27:53.393 --> 01:27:55.310
<i>Be careful with that gun.</i>

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:56.520
Yes, I know.

01:27:56.771 --> 01:27:59.147
<i>You girls are in</i>
<i>some hot water.</i>

01:27:59.232 --> 01:28:00.941
<i>You both okay?</i>
<i>Neither one of you hurt?</i>

01:28:01.025 --> 01:28:03.610
Yes, sir, we're...
We're fine.
We're both fine.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:04.903
Good.

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.114
<i>You want to tell me</i>
<i>what happened?</i>

01:28:07.198 --> 01:28:09.950
Sure, over coffee,
sometime. I'll buy.

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:14.162
I want you to know
neither one of you are
charged with murder yet.

01:28:15.164 --> 01:28:17.332
You're just still
wanted for questioning.

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:22.004
Although now,
Mrs. Dickinson's wanted in
Oklahoma for armed robbery.

01:28:24.549 --> 01:28:27.843
No kidding? Look,
we gotta go. I'll
call you back, all right?

01:28:27.927 --> 01:28:30.053
Ms. Sawyer,
I don't think you all are
gonna make it to Mexico.

01:28:30.763 --> 01:28:34.725
<i>We should talk. Please,</i>
<i>I want to help you.</i>

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:36.893
Shit.

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:41.064
God, that J. D. Kid
is a little shit.

01:28:42.025 --> 01:28:44.276
What? What?

01:28:45.737 --> 01:28:48.739
Thelma, how did they know
we're going to Mexico, huh?

01:28:48.823 --> 01:28:49.990
How did they know that?

01:28:51.617 --> 01:28:55.037
You told that
thieving little shit
where we were going?

01:28:55.121 --> 01:28:57.372
Oh.

01:28:57.957 --> 01:29:02.753
I just... I just told him
if he ever got to Mexico,
he should look us up.

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:06.048
But I... I asked him
not to tell.

01:29:06.132 --> 01:29:08.383
I mean, I...

01:29:08.468 --> 01:29:10.886
I thought he would
not tell anybody,
you know.

01:29:11.012 --> 01:29:12.512
Why?
I didn't think
he'd tell anybody.

01:29:12.597 --> 01:29:15.182
Why? What's he got to lose?
Except my life savings,
of course.

01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:16.350
Oh, shit!

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.893
Thelma, God damn it!

01:29:19.103 --> 01:29:21.229
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean...

01:29:21.314 --> 01:29:23.065
Oh, God damn it, Thelma!

01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:25.609
Look, up until now,
we had only two things
going for us,

01:29:25.693 --> 01:29:27.194
one, nobody knew
where we were,
and two,

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:28.570
no one knew where
we were going.

01:29:28.654 --> 01:29:30.697
Now one of the things
we had going for us is gone!

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:43.210
Look, Thelma,
you just gotta stop
talking to people.

01:29:43.294 --> 01:29:45.212
You gotta stop
being so open.

01:29:45.296 --> 01:29:47.381
We're fugitives now,
all right?

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:50.550
Let's start
behaving like that.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:51.843
You're right.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:53.345
Thank you.
Okay.

01:29:56.099 --> 01:29:57.516
<i>I was wondering...</i>

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:00.936
<i>Listen, little boy,</i>
<i>of course I want you to go.</i>

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:04.231
<i>If that's</i>
<i>what's worrying you,</i>
<i>please don't think...</i>

01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:06.983
<i>No, I wasn't</i>
<i>worrying about that.</i>

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:10.153
<i>I knew you'd want me</i>
<i>to take the job, sure,</i>
<i>but...</i>

01:30:13.199 --> 01:30:14.491
Sorry.

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:17.035
Judy,
<i>let's get married.</i>

01:30:26.337 --> 01:30:28.380
My God,
this is beautiful.

01:30:29.715 --> 01:30:31.174
It surely is.

01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:35.512
I always wanted to travel,
I just never got
the opportunity.

01:30:37.765 --> 01:30:38.890
You got it now.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:53.321
<i>The morning sun</i>

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:59.119
<i>Touched lightly on</i>
<i>the eyes of Lucy Jordan</i>

01:30:59.203 --> 01:31:02.789
<i>In a white suburban bedroom</i>

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:06.835
<i>In a white suburban town</i>

01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:10.714
<i>As she lay there</i>
<i>beneath the covers</i>

01:31:10.798 --> 01:31:14.718
<i>Dreaming of</i>
<i>a thousand lovers</i>

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:18.805
<i>Till the world</i>
<i>turned to orange</i>

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:24.060
<i>And the room</i>
<i>went spinning round</i>

01:31:25.062 --> 01:31:28.064
<i>At the age of thirty-seven</i>

01:31:29.066 --> 01:31:30.859
<i>She realized</i>

01:31:30.943 --> 01:31:36.698
<i>She'd never ride through</i>
<i>Paris in a sports car</i>

01:31:36.782 --> 01:31:41.786
<i>With the warm wind</i>
<i>in her hair</i>

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:46.625
<i>So she let</i>
<i>the phone keep ringing</i>

01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:50.670
<i>And she sat there</i>
<i>softly singing</i>

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:52.964
<i>Little nursery rhymes</i>

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:58.595
<i>She'd memorized in</i>
<i>her daddy's easy chair</i>

01:32:00.932 --> 01:32:03.975
<i>At the age of thirty-seven</i>

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:08.230
<i>She knew she'd found forever</i>

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.234
<i>As she rode along</i>
<i>through Paris</i>

01:32:12.818 --> 01:32:15.612
<i>With the warm wind</i>
<i>in her hair</i>

01:32:49.105 --> 01:32:50.647
What's going on?

01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:55.694
Nothing.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:12.419
Shit. Well, we don't need
the East Coast anymore.

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:19.843
Hey, look!
Look who it is,
it's that guy.

01:33:19.927 --> 01:33:21.761
I'll be darned.
Just ignore him.

01:33:24.265 --> 01:33:28.351
Hey, baby!
I'm your Captain
Muff-Diver!

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:32.063
Your storm trooper
of love!

01:33:38.362 --> 01:33:39.904
I ignored him.

01:34:20.696 --> 01:34:21.821
What?

01:34:22.365 --> 01:34:24.449
What?
Harlan.

01:34:27.036 --> 01:34:28.953
What about it?
Nothing.

01:34:29.955 --> 01:34:31.539
Just...

01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:35.752
Just the look
on his face when...

01:34:36.379 --> 01:34:37.462
What?

01:34:38.255 --> 01:34:41.216
He sure wasn't
expecting that.

01:34:45.262 --> 01:34:46.638
"Suck my dick."

01:34:50.059 --> 01:34:51.226
Thelma, it's not funny.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:54.396
I know.

01:35:03.114 --> 01:35:04.322
It happened to you,
didn't it?

01:35:06.617 --> 01:35:08.451
What? What are you
talking about?

01:35:09.328 --> 01:35:10.578
In Texas.

01:35:11.372 --> 01:35:13.957
I mean, that's what...
That's what happened,
isn't it?

01:35:15.126 --> 01:35:16.710
You was raped.

01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:24.426
Hey, now, look.
I'm warning you.
Just drop it.

01:35:25.177 --> 01:35:26.553
I'm not gonna
talk about that.

01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:29.597
You understand?
Yeah.

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:31.558
I'm not talking about it.
Okay.

01:35:31.642 --> 01:35:33.226
You understand?
Yeah.

01:35:33.477 --> 01:35:34.936
Okay, Louise.

01:35:40.651 --> 01:35:47.157
It's okay.

01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:23.818
Oh, shit!

01:36:23.903 --> 01:36:25.987
Thelma, we're getting
pulled over.
All right.

01:36:27.406 --> 01:36:28.698
Shit! Shit!

01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:30.742
What'd you wanna do?
What should we do?

01:36:30.826 --> 01:36:32.494
I don't know.
I don't know.

01:36:32.578 --> 01:36:33.870
All right, we'll just
go play it by ear.

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:36.289
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe he's just gonna
give me a ticket.

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:39.125
Oh, God.
Oh, God, please don't
let us get caught.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:41.294
God, please, please, God.
Don't let us get caught.

01:36:41.378 --> 01:36:42.712
All right, I'm just
gonna pull over.

01:37:01.023 --> 01:37:02.398
<i>Turn off your engine.</i>

01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:10.490
He's putting on his hat.

01:37:22.419 --> 01:37:23.878
Oh, my God,
he's a Nazi.

01:37:23.963 --> 01:37:26.339
What's he doing?
He's kind of
walking this way.

01:37:33.889 --> 01:37:35.139
Hello, Officer.

01:37:36.058 --> 01:37:37.308
Is there a problem?

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:39.769
You want to let me
see your license, please?

01:37:40.938 --> 01:37:42.105
Right.

01:37:43.399 --> 01:37:44.607
Here it is.

01:37:45.484 --> 01:37:47.026
You wanna take it
out of your wallet,
please?

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:48.820
All right.

01:37:49.405 --> 01:37:52.866
I told you to slow down.
Officer, I told her
to slow down.

01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:55.243
She did.
How fast was I going?

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:57.370
About 110.
Oh.

01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:59.706
You want to get out
of the car, please?

01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:01.207
Yes, sir. Sure.

01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:07.046
Come with me, please.

01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:08.298
Yes, sir.

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.094
This your vehicle?

01:38:13.178 --> 01:38:14.470
Yes, sir, that is.

01:38:17.766 --> 01:38:19.934
You want to get in
the car, please?

01:38:20.019 --> 01:38:21.102
Yes, sir.

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.314
Front or the back?

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:25.481
Front.

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.487
Do you want to take off
your eyewear, please?

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:32.697
Yes, sir.

01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.912
Am I in trouble,
Officer?

01:38:38.996 --> 01:38:41.831
As far as I'm concerned,
yes, ma'am, you're in
a lot of trouble.

01:38:43.375 --> 01:38:45.126
Hello, this is 9-8...

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:48.421
You want to step back
and get in your car
again, please?

01:38:48.505 --> 01:38:51.925
Officer, I am so
sorry about this,

01:38:52.009 --> 01:38:53.676
but would you
let go of that?

01:38:55.012 --> 01:38:57.221
Now, I really,
really apologize,

01:38:57.306 --> 01:39:00.183
but would you put your hands
on the steering wheel?

01:39:00.267 --> 01:39:01.976
See, if you get
on that radio,

01:39:02.061 --> 01:39:04.687
you're gonna find out that
we're wanted in two states

01:39:04.772 --> 01:39:07.941
and probably considered
armed and dangerous,
at least I am,

01:39:08.025 --> 01:39:11.194
and then our whole plan's
just gonna be
all shot to hell.

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.363
Louise, take his gun.

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.950
Take his gun,
Louise.
Right there.

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:19.827
Right.
I'm real sorry.
Excuse me.

01:39:19.912 --> 01:39:21.996
You want to step out
of the car, please?

01:39:25.668 --> 01:39:27.085
I swear,
three days ago,

01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:29.170
neither one of us
would've ever pulled
a stunt like this,

01:39:29.254 --> 01:39:32.215
but if you was ever
to meet my husband,
you'd understand why.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:35.677
You want to put your hands
on your head, please?

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.553
Louise.
What?

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.597
Shoot the radio.
Right.

01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.646
The police radio,
Louise.

01:39:46.730 --> 01:39:48.064
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.

01:39:51.860 --> 01:39:53.861
Got it.
Okay. All right.

01:39:53.946 --> 01:39:56.447
You want to step to
the back of the car,
please?

01:39:57.825 --> 01:39:59.325
Louise, get the keys.

01:40:05.666 --> 01:40:07.875
Thelma, what is it?
What's wrong?

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.002
Air holes.

01:40:09.253 --> 01:40:10.586
Open the trunk.

01:40:12.756 --> 01:40:15.675
Shit, Thelma.
Who would've
thought it?

01:40:16.051 --> 01:40:17.427
You want to step
into the trunk,
please?

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:22.807
Please, I have
a wife and kids.
Please!

01:40:23.475 --> 01:40:25.643
You do? Well,
you're lucky.

01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:28.271
You be sweet to them,
especially your wife.

01:40:28.355 --> 01:40:31.190
My husband
wasn't sweet to me,
look how I turned out.

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:33.317
Now, go on.
Get in there.

01:40:33.944 --> 01:40:36.487
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Excuse me.

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:40.450
Oh. Wait a minute.
Officer, could I have
your belt, please?

01:40:41.952 --> 01:40:43.870
Extra ammo.
Good idea.

01:40:43.954 --> 01:40:47.331
And... And could I
trade glasses
with you, maybe?

01:40:49.460 --> 01:40:50.877
Thanks. Okay.

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:52.295
- Is that it?
- Uh-huh.

01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:54.005
Right.

01:40:54.798 --> 01:40:57.050
Officer, I'm real
sorry about this.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:40:58.468
I apologize, also.

01:41:00.763 --> 01:41:01.763
Go.

01:41:07.936 --> 01:41:09.812
You ready?
Hit it.

01:41:14.318 --> 01:41:16.152
Now, I know it's crazy,

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:19.822
but I just feel like
I got a knack for this shit.

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:21.324
I believe you do.

01:41:24.286 --> 01:41:25.453
Drive like hell.

01:41:32.377 --> 01:41:34.754
The one thing
I can't figure out is
whether these girls are

01:41:34.838 --> 01:41:37.465
real smart
or just real,
real lucky.

01:41:38.175 --> 01:41:39.675
It don't matter.

01:41:40.302 --> 01:41:43.638
Brains'll only get you
so far and luck
always runs out.

01:41:46.642 --> 01:41:48.267
Louise,
we still going to Mexico?

01:41:48.352 --> 01:41:49.393
Yeah.

01:41:50.104 --> 01:41:53.022
Then aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

01:41:53.565 --> 01:41:56.442
Well, I figure if you
take a state policeman,
shoot off his car,

01:41:56.527 --> 01:41:58.194
take his gun
and lock him
in the trunk,

01:41:58.278 --> 01:42:00.613
it's best just to get on
out of the state if you can.

01:42:00.697 --> 01:42:01.739
I heard that.

01:42:02.699 --> 01:42:03.699
Hey!

01:42:04.785 --> 01:42:06.702
Don't dent my car!

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:13.334
I think I fucked up.

01:42:16.004 --> 01:42:18.548
I think I got us
in a situation where
we both could get killed.

01:42:20.884 --> 01:42:23.302
Damn, I don't know
why I just didn't go
to the police right away.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.680
You know why.
You already said.

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:27.974
What'd I say again?

01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:29.684
Nobody'd believe us.

01:42:30.561 --> 01:42:33.312
We'd still get in trouble,
we'd still have
our lives ruined.

01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:36.357
You know what else?
What?

01:42:37.526 --> 01:42:39.152
That guy was hurting me.

01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:42.989
If you hadn't come out
when you did, he would've
hurt me a lot worse.

01:42:43.073 --> 01:42:44.824
And probably nothing
would've happened to him

01:42:44.908 --> 01:42:46.742
'cause everybody did see me
dancing with him all night.

01:42:46.952 --> 01:42:49.370
They would've made out
like I'd asked for it.

01:42:50.914 --> 01:42:53.791
My life would've been
ruined a whole lot
worse than it is now.

01:42:54.585 --> 01:42:56.085
At least now
I'm having some fun.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:43:00.423
And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch
is dead.

01:43:01.049 --> 01:43:03.301
I'm just sorry
it was you that
did it and not me.

01:43:20.777 --> 01:43:21.944
Hello?

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:23.696
Let me talk to Slocumb.

01:43:25.365 --> 01:43:26.449
She wants to talk to you.

01:43:32.289 --> 01:43:33.289
Hello, Louise.

01:43:33.373 --> 01:43:34.373
Hi.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:36.209
<i>How are things</i>
<i>going out there?</i>

01:43:36.293 --> 01:43:39.962
Weird. We got some kind of
a snowball effect happening
here or something.

01:43:40.047 --> 01:43:41.380
You're still
with us, though.

01:43:41.465 --> 01:43:42.506
Mmm-hmm.

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:44.342
<i>You're somewhere on</i>
<i>the face of the earth.</i>

01:43:44.426 --> 01:43:47.094
Well, we're not
in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.

01:43:48.972 --> 01:43:50.306
I swear.

01:43:50.891 --> 01:43:52.850
Louise, I almost feel
like I know you.

01:43:53.018 --> 01:43:54.227
Well, you don't.

01:43:54.311 --> 01:43:56.604
You're getting in deeper
every moment you're gone.

01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:59.232
Would you believe me
if I told you this whole
thing was an accident?

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:01.192
I do believe you.

01:44:01.276 --> 01:44:04.111
That's what I want
everybody to believe.

01:44:04.196 --> 01:44:06.864
Trouble is,
it doesn't look
like an accident.

01:44:07.324 --> 01:44:10.076
And you're not here
to tell me about it.

01:44:10.661 --> 01:44:13.079
I need your help here.
Did Harlan Puckett...

01:44:13.163 --> 01:44:14.372
<i>I don't wanna</i>
<i>talk about it.</i>

01:44:14.456 --> 01:44:16.749
You wanna come on in?

01:44:16.833 --> 01:44:18.042
<i>Don't think so.</i>

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:22.338
Then I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to
charge you with murder.

01:44:23.006 --> 01:44:24.924
<i>Now, do you want to</i>
<i>come out of this alive?</i>

01:44:25.008 --> 01:44:29.303
You know, certain words
and phrases just keep
drifting through my mind.

01:44:29.388 --> 01:44:33.599
Things like "incarceration,"
"cavity search,"
"death by electrocution,"

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:36.394
"life imprisonment,"
shit like that.
You know what I'm saying?

01:44:36.478 --> 01:44:38.479
So do I want to
come out alive?

01:44:39.189 --> 01:44:40.982
I don't know, I...

01:44:46.154 --> 01:44:49.490
I don't know. I think
we're gonna have
to think about that.

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:53.536
Louise, I'll do anything.

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:58.541
I know what's
making you run.

01:45:00.210 --> 01:45:01.961
I know what happened
to you in Texas.

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.802
Come on, Louise.

01:45:11.179 --> 01:45:12.722
Don't blow it.

01:45:13.223 --> 01:45:14.223
We got it!

01:45:15.309 --> 01:45:16.809
Give it to me.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:26.152
Max, you gotta
take me there.

01:45:26.236 --> 01:45:27.570
No, Hal, cannot do.

01:45:27.696 --> 01:45:29.989
I'm the only one
she's ever spoken to.
You've done a good job.

01:45:30.073 --> 01:45:31.699
You're no good to me now.
You're no good to me.

01:45:31.783 --> 01:45:33.159
There's nothing
you can do
for me now.

01:45:33.243 --> 01:45:35.786
I don't want anybody
losing their heads!

01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:37.204
You know what happens.

01:45:37.289 --> 01:45:38.664
The volume gets
turned way up,

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:40.958
and the next thing you know,
these girls are
gonna get shot!

01:45:53.263 --> 01:45:54.472
What?

01:45:56.266 --> 01:45:59.018
You're not gonna
give up on me,
are you?

01:45:59.102 --> 01:46:00.144
What do you mean?

01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:03.397
You're not gonna
make a deal
with that guy?

01:46:04.274 --> 01:46:06.609
I mean,
I just want to know.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.404
Thelma, I'm not
making any deals.

01:46:14.493 --> 01:46:17.912
I mean, I'd understand
if you was thinking about it.

01:46:18.747 --> 01:46:22.249
In a way, you got
something to go back for,
Jimmy and all.

01:46:22.334 --> 01:46:23.667
Jimmy's not an option.

01:46:26.755 --> 01:46:27.922
But...

01:46:29.299 --> 01:46:35.679
I don't know, you know,
something's, like,
crossed over in me.

01:46:36.139 --> 01:46:38.766
And I can't go back.

01:46:40.185 --> 01:46:43.604
I mean, I just
couldn't live.

01:46:43.855 --> 01:46:47.316
I know. I know
what you mean.

01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:53.280
Anyway, we don't
want to end up on
the damn Geraldo show.

01:46:54.533 --> 01:46:55.825
Yeah.

01:47:03.625 --> 01:47:06.127
They're charging us
with murder.

01:47:07.379 --> 01:47:08.504
Ooh.

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:11.090
Yeah, they say that
we gotta figure out

01:47:11.174 --> 01:47:12.675
if we want to come in
dead or alive.

01:47:14.553 --> 01:47:17.513
Gosh, didn't he say
anything positive at all?

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:45.791
You awake?

01:47:47.294 --> 01:47:49.253
Guess you could
call it that.
My eyes are open.

01:47:50.505 --> 01:47:53.215
Me, too.
I feel awake.

01:47:53.467 --> 01:47:54.550
Good.

01:47:55.510 --> 01:47:56.635
Wide-awake.

01:47:57.345 --> 01:48:00.639
I don't remember ever
feeling this awake.
You know what I mean?

01:48:02.434 --> 01:48:04.059
Everything looks different.

01:48:05.604 --> 01:48:08.898
You feel like that, too,
like you got something
to look forward to?

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:14.236
We'll be drinking margaritas
by the sea, mamacita.

01:48:15.071 --> 01:48:16.238
Hey, we could
change our names.

01:48:16.323 --> 01:48:17.823
We could live
in a hacienda.

01:48:17.908 --> 01:48:20.868
I'm gonna get a job.
I'm gonna work at Club Med.

01:48:21.244 --> 01:48:22.411
Yeah.

01:48:23.872 --> 01:48:27.082
Now what kind of a deal
is that cop gonna have
to come up with to beat that?

01:48:27.834 --> 01:48:29.877
Have to be pretty good.
Have to be pretty
damn good.

01:48:48.563 --> 01:48:53.234
<i>Better not look down</i>
<i>if you want to keep on flying</i>

01:48:53.318 --> 01:48:58.113
<i>Put the hammer down</i>
<i>Keep it full speed ahead</i>

01:48:58.198 --> 01:49:00.157
<i>Better not look back</i>

01:49:00.242 --> 01:49:02.952
<i>Or you might</i>
<i>just wind up crying</i>

01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:05.371
<i>You can keep it moving</i>

01:49:05.455 --> 01:49:08.374
Oh, my God, Louise!
Oh! Look, look!

01:49:08.917 --> 01:49:09.917
See if that's him.

01:49:11.753 --> 01:49:14.088
It's him.
It's definitely him.

01:49:15.090 --> 01:49:16.298
Pass him.

01:49:17.342 --> 01:49:19.552
<i>Better not look back</i>

01:49:19.636 --> 01:49:22.096

<i>You can keep it moving</i>

01:49:34.484 --> 01:49:38.195
Hey, baby!
You ready for
a big dick?

01:49:48.665 --> 01:49:49.748
Hi.

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:52.251
Hi, there.
You all right?

01:49:52.627 --> 01:49:54.169
We're fine.
How are you?

01:49:55.046 --> 01:49:56.171
Great!

01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:59.425
You girls about
ready to get serious?

01:50:02.637 --> 01:50:03.721
I think so.

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:06.599
Follow us.

Where you going?
Fresno.

01:51:08.578 --> 01:51:10.245
We've been seeing you
all over the place.

01:51:10.830 --> 01:51:13.749
Why don't you take
off those shades?
I want to see your eyes.

01:51:15.168 --> 01:51:17.378
Yeah, I been
seeing you, too.

01:51:17.754 --> 01:51:19.797
Yeah, we think
you have really
bad manners.

01:51:19.881 --> 01:51:21.507
Yeah.

01:51:21.591 --> 01:51:25.302
Yeah, where do you get off
behaving like that with
women you don't even know?

01:51:25.887 --> 01:51:26.887
Huh?

01:51:29.349 --> 01:51:31.308
How'd you feel if somebody
did that to your mother?

01:51:31.976 --> 01:51:34.311
Or your sister?
Or your wife?

01:51:35.271 --> 01:51:36.271
Huh?

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:37.773
What are you
talking about?

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:40.442
You know good and damn well
what I'm talking about.

01:51:40.902 --> 01:51:43.404
I mean, really.
That business
with your tongue.

01:51:43.488 --> 01:51:45.406
What is that?
That is disgusting!

01:51:45.490 --> 01:51:47.533
And, oh, my God,
that other shit of
pointing to your lap.

01:51:47.617 --> 01:51:49.827
I mean, what is that
supposed to mean
exactly, huh?

01:51:49.911 --> 01:51:53.288
Does that mean "Pull over.
I wanna show you what
a big, fat slob I am"?

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:55.124
Yeah, or does that mean,
"Suck my dick"?

01:51:56.042 --> 01:51:58.127
You women are crazy!
You got that right.

01:51:58.545 --> 01:52:00.796
We think
you should apologize.

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:03.048
I ain't apologizing
for shit!

01:52:03.133 --> 01:52:04.633
You say you're sorry.

01:52:06.261 --> 01:52:07.761
Fuck that!

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:17.771
You say you're sorry,
or I'm gonna make you
fucking sorry.

01:52:18.231 --> 01:52:19.690
Oh, Jesus.

01:52:20.316 --> 01:52:23.110
I'll bet you even called us
"beavers" on your CB radio,
didn't you?

01:52:23.319 --> 01:52:24.987
Yeah. Sure did!

01:52:25.655 --> 01:52:28.907
Damn! I hate that.
I hate being called
a beaver, don't you?

01:52:28.992 --> 01:52:30.200
You gonna
apologize or what?

01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:33.996
Fuck you!

01:52:40.712 --> 01:52:41.712
Ooh!

01:52:43.381 --> 01:52:47.092
Oh! Goddamn,
you bitch!

01:52:48.845 --> 01:52:50.471
I don't think he is
gonna apologize.

01:52:50.555 --> 01:52:51.889
Nah, I don't think so.

01:53:05.862 --> 01:53:07.237
You bitches!

01:53:08.323 --> 01:53:12.201
You bitches from hell!
God damn it!

01:53:13.244 --> 01:53:15.704
You're gonna have
to pay for this!

01:53:18.124 --> 01:53:20.626
You're gonna have
to pay for that!

01:53:21.252 --> 01:53:22.586
I'm gonna make you!

01:53:31.012 --> 01:53:34.890
I'm gonna make you
pay for this!
You hear me?

01:53:40.605 --> 01:53:41.730
Oh, my God!

01:53:42.398 --> 01:53:44.650
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

01:53:44.734 --> 01:53:45.984
Off the TV.

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:49.822
How about you?
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:51.073
Texas.

01:53:51.282 --> 01:53:52.324
Whoo.

<i>5'10" tall, 130 pounds.</i>

01:55:40.934 --> 01:55:43.894
<i>Both subjects armed</i>
<i>and extremely dangerous.</i>

01:55:43.978 --> 01:55:45.562
<i>Approach with caution.</i>

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:50.317
<i>... New Mexico and Arizona</i>
<i>on felony warrants</i>
<i>for armed robbery,</i>

01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:54.655
<i>kidnapping</i>
<i>a law enforcement officer,</i>
<i>assault with a deadly weapon.</i>

01:55:54.739 --> 01:55:58.784
<i>Suspect driving,</i>
<i>Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.</i>
<i>White female...</i>

01:56:17.553 --> 01:56:18.553
Think they saw us?

01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:25.227
I don't know.
I don't think so.

01:56:25.728 --> 01:56:27.187
We better get off,
just in case.

01:57:10.273 --> 01:57:11.523
You got your
seat belt on?

01:57:12.859 --> 01:57:15.235
This is 1-12.
I am in pursuit

01:57:15.319 --> 01:57:17.404
<i>of green Thunderbird.</i>
<i>Requesting assistance.</i>

01:57:21.034 --> 01:57:22.075
Shit.

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.957
We have
the suspects in sight.
Continuing pursuit.

01:57:34.756 --> 01:57:35.756
Remain in position!

01:57:42.638 --> 01:57:44.598
I know this whole thing
was my fault. I know it.

01:57:44.682 --> 01:57:46.600
Damn it, Thelma,
if there's one thing
you should know by now,

01:57:46.684 --> 01:57:47.684
this wasn't your fault!

01:57:49.145 --> 01:57:52.814
Louise,
no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.

01:57:53.649 --> 01:57:54.775
Shit.

01:58:00.948 --> 01:58:02.657
Oh, shit.

01:58:06.204 --> 01:58:08.497
Did you see that guy?
He was right in
the middle of the road!

01:58:22.553 --> 01:58:24.012
Hold on!

01:58:47.036 --> 01:58:49.079
I guess everything
from here on in is
gonna be pretty shitty.

01:58:49.163 --> 01:58:50.580
Unbearable, I'd imagine.

01:58:50.665 --> 01:58:52.624
Look, everything
we got to lose
is already gone anyway.

01:58:52.708 --> 01:58:54.334
Oh, God. How do you
stay so positive?

01:59:07.181 --> 01:59:09.474
Come on, let's go!

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.276
You're a good friend.

02:00:01.777 --> 02:00:02.944
You, too, sweetie,
the best.

02:00:06.073 --> 02:00:08.450
How do you like
the vacation so far?

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:15.790
I guess I went
a little crazy, huh?

02:00:16.542 --> 02:00:18.627
No, you've always
been crazy.

02:00:18.794 --> 02:00:20.295
This is just the first
chance you've ever had

02:00:20.379 --> 02:00:21.504
to really express yourself.

02:00:27.470 --> 02:00:28.470
Good driving.

02:00:31.432 --> 02:00:32.641
Thanks.

02:01:44.964 --> 02:01:46.881
Oh, my God.

02:01:47.883 --> 02:01:49.134
What in the hell is this?

02:01:50.553 --> 02:01:51.928
I don't know.
I think...

02:01:52.805 --> 02:01:55.015
I think it's the goddamn
Grand Canyon.

02:01:57.601 --> 02:01:59.227
Isn't it beautiful?

02:02:00.271 --> 02:02:03.648
Yeah. It's something
else, all right.

02:03:08.798 --> 02:03:10.256
Oh, my God.

02:03:10.966 --> 02:03:11.966
It looks like the Army.

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:13.259
All this for us?

02:03:13.761 --> 02:03:16.221
Hey, don't let them
shoot those girls!

02:03:17.139 --> 02:03:19.349
This is too much.
They got guns
pointing at them!

02:03:19.433 --> 02:03:21.810
These women are armed,
Hal. This is standard.

02:03:21.894 --> 02:03:24.187
Now, calm down.
These boys know
what they're doing.

02:03:25.898 --> 02:03:28.191
<i>Place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view.</i>

02:03:28.275 --> 02:03:30.902
<i>Any failure to obey</i>
<i>that command</i>

02:03:30.986 --> 02:03:34.656
<i>will be considered</i>
<i>an act of aggression</i>
<i>against us.</i>

02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:41.162
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>turn your engine off</i>

02:03:41.247 --> 02:03:43.706
<i>and place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view.</i>

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:49.879
What are you doing?

02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.090
I'm not giving up.

02:03:52.508 --> 02:03:55.969
Max, you gotta do something!
How many times, Max?

02:03:56.053 --> 02:03:58.471
How many times
has that woman got
to be fucked over?

02:03:58.556 --> 02:04:02.016
Hey, listen! Will you
pull yourself together?
Now, listen to me!

02:04:02.101 --> 02:04:04.185
You calm down.
Don't make me
sorry I brought you.

02:04:04.520 --> 02:04:05.645
Damn it!

02:04:05.729 --> 02:04:06.855
I repeat,

02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:11.568
<i>cut your engine off</i>
<i>and place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view!</i>

02:04:18.451 --> 02:04:21.494
Okay, then, listen.
Let's not get caught.

02:04:23.247 --> 02:04:24.414
What are you
talking about?

02:04:27.376 --> 02:04:28.585
Let's keep going.

02:04:30.087 --> 02:04:31.171
What do you mean?

02:04:35.176 --> 02:04:36.217
Go!

02:04:42.057 --> 02:04:43.183
You sure?

02:04:46.061 --> 02:04:49.272
Yeah.

02:05:05.539 --> 02:05:06.539
Hey!

02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:37.672
<i>I felt it when the sun</i>
<i>came up this morning</i>

02:06:40.384 --> 02:06:44.929
<i>I knew that I could not</i>
<i>wait another day</i>

02:06:47.933 --> 02:06:52.937
<i>Darling, there is something</i>
<i>I must tell you</i>

02:06:55.649 --> 02:06:59.902
<i>A distant voice</i>
<i>is calling me away</i>

02:07:02.865 --> 02:07:07.827
<i>Until we find the bridge</i>
<i>across forever</i>

02:07:10.539 --> 02:07:14.792
<i>Until this grand illusion</i>
<i>brings us home</i>

02:07:18.130 --> 02:07:22.884
<i>You and I will</i>
<i>always be together</i>

02:07:25.304 --> 02:07:30.058
<i>From this day on</i>
<i>you'll never walk alone</i>

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:36.064
<i>You're a part of me</i>

02:07:37.066 --> 02:07:39.567
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

02:07:40.527 --> 02:07:43.571
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>

02:07:44.239 --> 02:07:47.033
<i>Whatever we go through</i>

02:07:48.077 --> 02:07:51.746
<i>Whatever time may take away</i>

02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:55.416
<i>It cannot change</i>
<i>the way we feel today</i>

02:07:55.918 --> 02:08:00.171
<i>So hold me close</i>
<i>and say you feel it too</i>

02:08:03.175 --> 02:08:07.845
<i>You're a part of me</i>
<i>and I'm a part of you</i>

02:08:14.144 --> 02:08:19.232
<i>I can hear it</i>
<i>when I stand</i>
<i>beside the river</i>

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:26.572
<i>I can see it</i>
<i>when I look up</i>
<i>in the sky</i>

02:08:29.410 --> 02:08:35.123
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

02:08:37.167 --> 02:08:41.754
<i>So many miles</i>
<i>to go before I die</i>

02:08:44.967 --> 02:08:49.470
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

02:08:52.349 --> 02:08:56.978
<i>Still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

02:08:59.982 --> 02:09:04.819
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

02:09:07.656 --> 02:09:12.660
<i>Darling, there is one thing</i>
<i>you should know</i>

02:09:15.164 --> 02:09:17.331
<i>You're a part of me</i>

02:09:18.876 --> 02:09:21.502
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

02:09:22.463 --> 02:09:25.214
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>
