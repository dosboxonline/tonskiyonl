01:00.762 --> 01:04.754
- But Professor...
- No. The answers are all there in the test.

02:16.173 --> 02:18.641
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:18.709 --> 02:22.874
I know. It's something to do with
the third differential coefficient.

02:22.948 --> 02:25.416
- Not that, Tonight,
- What?

02:25.484 --> 02:27.975
Emma?

02:28.053 --> 02:31.147
- What time is it?
- Almost5... 00,

02:31.223 --> 02:33.714
Oh, God.

02:42.535 --> 02:45.834
My proposal for utilizing
solar power, rejected,

02:45.905 --> 02:48.897
My concepts for harnessing
micro-energy waves, rejected,

02:48.975 --> 02:52.968
The dean suggests that
I focus on something that
might actually help mankind,

02:53.046 --> 02:55.105
Like his study on the benefits
of tobacco consumption,

02:55.181 --> 02:58.844
Alex, the problem is
your ideas are a bit too... radical,

02:58.918 --> 03:01.716
The problem is with
the faculty. They're dinosaurs.

03:01.788 --> 03:04.019
They're already extinct;
they just don't know it.

03:04.091 --> 03:08.118
They'll be discovered by some
future archaeologist, and he
won't know what to make of them.

03:08.195 --> 03:10.493
Their dim little eyes,
devoid of any curiosity...

03:10.564 --> 03:12.930
Alex, it's your first year
as associate professor.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.231
You might want to play things
a little more conservatively.

03:16.303 --> 03:18.703
You sound just like my father.

03:18.772 --> 03:22.572
Look at them, Philby. All alike.
All in identical bowler hats.

03:22.643 --> 03:24.874
Do you want your students
to turn out like that?

03:24.946 --> 03:28.814
I want my students prepared
for the realities of the world
they're about to greet.

03:28.883 --> 03:33.286
Well, I don't. I want them
to run along this street and
knock off every bowler they see.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.316
Mrs. Watchit!

03:38.393 --> 03:40.691
Oh, huzzah, the master's home.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.662
- Did you get it?
- Hello, Mr. Philby.

03:42.730 --> 03:45.392
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.
You're looking in the pink.

03:45.467 --> 03:48.869
Must be all the exercise I get
scampering up and down
these stairs like a wee lad.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.929
- Don't torture me. Did you get it?
- I got it.

03:51.006 --> 03:53.440
- Good. Let me see.
- But don't you think for one moment...

03:53.509 --> 03:56.171
I'm going to let you go out
in that filthy jacket.

03:56.245 --> 03:59.806
Now, go in there and change.

04:05.321 --> 04:09.190
And you've got another letter
from that annoying little man.

04:09.259 --> 04:12.660
Well, go ahead,
Switch it on,

04:12.729 --> 04:17.257
- It'll help people keep
their teeth well into their 40s,

04:17.334 --> 04:21.100
- You might think about
having that cleaned.
- Oh, who has the time?

04:21.171 --> 04:24.504
- How did you know with Molly?
- Know what?

04:24.574 --> 04:28.738
- You were meant to be together.
- She made the best
shepherd's pie I ever tasted.

04:28.812 --> 04:30.781
Don't you have a single
romantic bone in your body?

04:30.848 --> 04:34.716
No. I'm all bowler hat.

04:37.388 --> 04:40.721
Why do you waste your time
on that crackpot?

04:40.791 --> 04:43.259
Because he has some
very interesting ideas.

04:43.327 --> 04:47.286
A professor at Columbia
should not be corresponding
with a crazy German bookkeeper.

04:47.365 --> 04:49.526
He's a patent clerk,
not a bookkeeper.

04:49.600 --> 04:53.435
I think Mr. Einstein deserves
all the support I can give him.

04:53.505 --> 04:56.497
I wonder if we'll ever go too far?

04:56.575 --> 04:58.543
- With what?
- With this.

04:58.610 --> 05:01.670
With all of this.

05:01.747 --> 05:03.874
No such thing.

05:06.618 --> 05:09.178
All right. How do I look?

05:09.254 --> 05:12.155
Practically decent. Really, Alex.
Good luck tonight.

05:12.224 --> 05:15.388
She's a fine girl. She's done
wonderful things for you.

05:15.461 --> 05:19.261
Don't worry. You still have that
alluring smell of chalk.

05:19.332 --> 05:22.426
Oh, gotta hurry.

05:22.502 --> 05:26.666
Now, that's more like it.
You look a proper gentleman for once.

05:26.739 --> 05:29.264
Well, you better hope so. If Emma
turns me down, you'll be next.

05:29.342 --> 05:32.573
- Oh, I'm already swooning.

05:32.645 --> 05:35.979
All right. Wish me luck.

05:40.854 --> 05:42.788
Thank you.

05:50.831 --> 05:55.097
Fresh flowers. Fresh flowers.

05:59.107 --> 06:01.598
- Have some flowers, sir.
- Not tonight, thanks.

06:01.676 --> 06:04.975
No. I promised her flowers.

06:13.922 --> 06:15.856
Spectacular.

06:15.924 --> 06:19.759
Spectacular waste of money.
Damn thing's always breaking down.

06:19.829 --> 06:22.423
- Do you need a lift?
- Yes, yes.

06:22.498 --> 06:25.865
- How do you keep
the water temperature stable?
- There's a cantilevered gasket...

06:25.935 --> 06:28.233
- On the fuel regulator...

06:28.304 --> 06:31.330
Oh, God. Uh...

06:31.407 --> 06:35.400
Much obliged.
I'm always forgetting the damn brake.

06:35.478 --> 06:39.313
Hop in. I'll give you a perambulation
before it breaks down again.

06:39.383 --> 06:42.546
Oh, uh, I'm afraid
I have a prior engagement.

06:42.619 --> 06:45.281
Well, another time then.
We perambulate here most every night.

06:45.355 --> 06:47.016
Certainly.

06:49.526 --> 06:53.519
- Get a horse!

06:53.597 --> 06:55.588
Yes.

07:29.168 --> 07:31.398
Alexander?

07:39.211 --> 07:42.180
- Oh! Whoa.

07:42.247 --> 07:47.845
- You're late, Professor.
- I got here as soon as I could.

07:47.921 --> 07:52.358
Well, they say it's all the rage
in Paris. But I just picked it up...

07:52.425 --> 07:57.761
- Five dollars at Macy's.
Silly, isn't it?
- Very silly. I like it.

07:57.831 --> 08:01.426
Well, where are they?

08:01.501 --> 08:03.765
- What?
- The flowers.

08:03.837 --> 08:06.204
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

08:06.273 --> 08:09.572
Oh, I'm sorry.
l... Well, I was distracted.

08:09.643 --> 08:11.975
Well, there's something new.

08:12.046 --> 08:15.675
- Uh, Emma, I need to talk to you.

08:23.190 --> 08:27.786
- Oh, uh, shall we walk through the park?
- Yes.

08:32.100 --> 08:36.092
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

08:38.006 --> 08:40.668
Well, I'm afraid I am.

08:40.741 --> 08:45.645
I'm not sleeping very well, and even
when I'm awake, I'm not much use.

08:45.714 --> 08:49.708
I can't eat or think
or do much of anything anymore.

08:51.888 --> 08:56.052
And the worst part is,
I don't know that I'll ever be well.

08:56.125 --> 09:00.653
I think there's only one remedy,
and that's for you to marry me...

09:00.730 --> 09:05.565
- And spend the rest
of your life with me.

09:08.171 --> 09:12.302
Oh, Emma, I know it's right.
I know we're meant to be together.

09:12.376 --> 09:16.472
It's the only thing in my entire life
I've never had to think about.

09:16.547 --> 09:18.640
Oh, Alex.

09:20.350 --> 09:23.251
Uh-Uh, wait.
I have something for you.

09:29.326 --> 09:33.491
You know, the moment is rather dying here.

09:33.565 --> 09:36.398
l-I know.
Hold on. Oh.

09:47.111 --> 09:50.444
- I know it's not a diamond.
- A moonstone.

09:50.515 --> 09:53.484
Well, it's your birthstone.
I thought...

09:53.551 --> 09:56.385
You thought right.

10:06.765 --> 10:10.257
I just might cry,

10:10.336 --> 10:14.329
I couldn't help but overhear.

10:14.406 --> 10:20.243
Two fine young people starting out
on the road of life.

10:20.313 --> 10:22.679
- I wish you the very best.

10:22.749 --> 10:26.310
- Well, thank you.
- And as much as I hate to do this...

10:26.386 --> 10:31.050
moved as I am by your...
protestations of love...

10:31.124 --> 10:34.389
I'll be needing
your money now.

10:34.461 --> 10:37.589
- Sir?
- And your jewellery too.

10:37.664 --> 10:42.261
I guess we could call this
your first little bump
on the road to marital bliss.

10:42.336 --> 10:45.999
- I don't understand...
- Don't make a scene.
There's no cause for that.

10:46.073 --> 10:49.406
- Just give me your wallet, will you?
- Hmm?

10:50.978 --> 10:52.912
Did you hear me, lad?

10:52.980 --> 10:56.848
Uh, all right, all right.
Here. That's everything.

10:58.686 --> 11:01.155
And your watch.

11:04.593 --> 11:07.289
And the gloves.

11:12.234 --> 11:16.193
- And the ring.
- No.

11:16.271 --> 11:19.206
I'm afraid so, darling.

11:19.274 --> 11:24.372
- And maybe he'll
buy you a diamond now.
- Please, please. Not that.

11:24.447 --> 11:26.972
Don't!

11:36.559 --> 11:41.258
Why did you do that?
It's only a ring.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.765
Emma?

11:56.246 --> 11:59.409
Emma?

11:59.483 --> 12:02.475
Oh!

12:39.225 --> 12:42.888
- What?

12:49.703 --> 12:55.369
Oh. Oh, sir,
Mr. Philby's here.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.741
- Here?
- Yes, sir, He insisted on coming...

12:58.812 --> 13:03.306
- Tell him to go away, I'm busy,
- I won't go away, Alex.

13:04.985 --> 13:08.318
My God.
What's happened to you?

13:10.224 --> 13:13.022
I've been...
I've been working.

13:13.094 --> 13:16.757
You remember that?
You used to care about your work.

13:16.831 --> 13:20.494
I care more about my life.
And yours.

13:20.568 --> 13:23.059
I came by the house every day
after the funeral...

13:23.137 --> 13:26.038
and every week
and every other month.

13:26.107 --> 13:30.271
Then I stopped coming.
Did you even notice?

13:30.344 --> 13:35.078
- It hurt me, Alex... very much.
- Then why are you here now?

13:35.150 --> 13:38.608
- There are some things I have to
say you may not like hearing...
- I know. I know.

13:38.687 --> 13:42.646
You're concerned. I know.
I hear it from Mrs. Watchit every day.

13:42.725 --> 13:46.422
But really...
I need you to go.

13:46.495 --> 13:49.328
- I won't leave. Not with
you hiding down here.
- I'm not hiding.

13:49.398 --> 13:52.890
You know that's what it is.
Mrs. Watchit says you're in
here all hours... day and night.

13:52.968 --> 13:55.802
Alex, will you please
stand still and look at me!

13:59.109 --> 14:02.806
It wasn't your fault.

14:04.948 --> 14:09.783
No. It wasn't my fault.

14:09.853 --> 14:15.417
Maybe we should blame Mrs. Watchit for
picking up the ring from the jeweller.

14:15.493 --> 14:18.758
Or the jeweller for making it.

14:18.829 --> 14:23.823
Or the poor bastard who tore
the stone from the earth.

14:23.901 --> 14:28.270
Maybe I should blame you
for introducing me to Emma
in the first place. Yes.

14:28.339 --> 14:33.106
Alexander, nothing will
ever change what happened.

14:33.177 --> 14:38.514
No, you're wrong,
because I will change it.

14:38.583 --> 14:42.747
David, I appreciate
your concern. I do.

14:42.821 --> 14:45.949
But I ask you to have faith in me.

14:46.024 --> 14:49.187
Well, l-I want to have
faith in you, Alex, but...

14:49.261 --> 14:53.493
Wha... What are...
What are you doing here?

14:53.565 --> 14:58.559
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you come by for dinner
in a week, and I'll show you?

14:58.637 --> 15:03.007
- Why don't you come home
with me now? Molly...
- Did you not hear me, David?

15:04.811 --> 15:07.780
I can't leave
when I'm so close.

15:10.183 --> 15:13.516
All right. We'll continue
this conversation in a week.

15:19.425 --> 15:22.759
In a week, we'll never even
have had this conversation.

18:33.128 --> 18:36.292
Ah. Thank you, my good man.

19:00.857 --> 19:04.850
You're early.
That's a first.

19:04.928 --> 19:08.955
I wanted to see you.

19:09.032 --> 19:11.432
Well, where are they?

19:11.501 --> 19:15.904
- What?
- The flowers.

19:17.474 --> 19:20.808
You promised me flowers tonight.
Don't you even remember?

19:32.323 --> 19:36.555
You never cease
to surprise me.

19:41.433 --> 19:45.028
Emma, I need to talk to you.

19:45.104 --> 19:48.505
- Shall we walk through the park?
- No!

19:48.574 --> 19:50.940
No,

19:52.644 --> 19:56.444
No. Let's go into the city.

19:56.515 --> 19:59.177
- Alex, what is it?
- Nothing. Let's just hurry.

19:59.251 --> 20:04.212
Running along is all very well for you.
You're not wearing a corset.

20:08.361 --> 20:11.353
- Bleecker Street, and be quick about it.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.481
Now you're all gallant.

20:46.268 --> 20:51.069
Professor, you're shivering. I hope
you're not coming down with something.

20:51.139 --> 20:55.701
No, no. I'm fine.

20:55.777 --> 21:00.544
I'm wonderful. I'm walking down
the street with you again.

21:00.615 --> 21:03.448
But we took a walk
three days ago.

21:03.518 --> 21:08.218
Well, not like this.
Never like this.

21:08.291 --> 21:12.728
- Heavens, look at that car.
- Oh, I've seen it.

21:12.795 --> 21:17.664
Now I know you're ill. You're passing up
the chance to explore some new gadget.

21:17.733 --> 21:22.568
- It's only a machine.
- Alexander, tell me what's going on.

21:22.638 --> 21:26.506
- Is something wrong?
- No.

21:26.576 --> 21:29.568
No.
Emma, listen to me.

21:29.646 --> 21:33.047
I need to leave you now, but I want you
to go straight home and stay there.

21:33.116 --> 21:37.951
I promise you I'll come by
sometime later tonight,
and I won't make any sense.

21:38.021 --> 21:41.354
I'll be all upset that you didn't meet
me in the park, but you must trust me.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.417
Everything will be all right.

21:45.929 --> 21:50.730
Just know how much I love you,
how much I'll always love you.

21:56.507 --> 21:59.999
All right.

22:00.078 --> 22:03.514
But first, where are my flowers?

22:08.553 --> 22:12.284
- Flowers it is.

22:12.357 --> 22:14.690
Wait right there.
Don't move.

22:24.637 --> 22:28.095
- Oh, can I help you, sir?
- Yes, a dozen roses. White.

22:28.173 --> 22:30.107
- No, no. Red.
- Look out!

22:50.930 --> 22:55.264
- Easy. Easy.

23:17.792 --> 23:21.285
I'm looking for
Professor Hartdegen.

23:28.103 --> 23:32.267
Alex, I'm...
I'm so sorry.

23:33.642 --> 23:37.772
- This was not supposed to happen.
- Of course not.

23:39.715 --> 23:43.709
- I know there's nothing I can say.
- We were out of the park, Philby.

23:43.786 --> 23:46.118
We were safe.

23:48.925 --> 23:51.917
Why can't I change it?

23:55.565 --> 23:58.898
I could come back
a thousand times.

23:58.968 --> 24:01.961
See her die a thousand ways.

24:04.241 --> 24:07.438
I don't...
I don't understand.

24:07.511 --> 24:10.844
I can't find the answer here.

24:12.716 --> 24:15.207
Not here.

24:21.525 --> 24:24.188
Not now.

27:47.307 --> 27:51.175
The future is now.

27:51.244 --> 27:54.111
Certain restrictions apply.
Blackout periods on availability
subject to change.

28:45.435 --> 28:47.335
Nice suit.

28:47.404 --> 28:50.396
Very retro.

28:50.473 --> 28:52.407
Thank you.

28:55.478 --> 28:58.641
Bet that makes
a hell of a cappuccino,

29:00.250 --> 29:02.343
That thing.

29:05.288 --> 29:06.916
I'll see you.

29:06.991 --> 29:10.757
Hi, friends. The latest update
from Lunar Leisure Living.

29:10.828 --> 29:14.229
Our engineers are currently preparing

29:42.294 --> 29:45.354
- All right, attention, everyone,

29:45.430 --> 29:49.231
Class 23, could we gather, please?
Our next stop is Antiquities.

29:49.302 --> 29:52.294
Please make sure that your microscans
are charged for download.

29:52.371 --> 29:55.340
- Two by two. Let's look lively.
Two by two.
- Stop! Quit!

29:55.408 --> 29:59.970
Tommy, if you do that again,
I will re-sequence your D.N.A.,
so help me! Now, march.

30:00.046 --> 30:03.038
March, march,
Two by two, please, Look lively,

30:12.526 --> 30:17.395
Welcome to Vox System,
How may I help you?

30:17.464 --> 30:20.399
I didn't see you there.

30:20.467 --> 30:23.436
I always seem to have that effect.
How may I help you, sir?

30:25.572 --> 30:29.565
- What is that thing?
- That is my photonic memory core,

30:29.643 --> 30:31.941
or P.M.C.,
as we say in the trade.

30:43.792 --> 30:46.761
Over here, sir.

30:49.397 --> 30:51.331
What are you?

30:51.399 --> 30:56.428
I'm the Fifth Avenue
Public Library information
unit, Vox registration NY-1 1 4.

30:56.505 --> 30:58.769
How may I help you?

30:58.841 --> 31:04.279
- A stereopticon of some sort.
- Stereopticon? Oh, no, sir,

31:04.346 --> 31:06.507
I am a third-generation,
fusion-powered photonic,

31:06.582 --> 31:09.574
with verbal and visual link capabilities
connected to every database...

31:09.652 --> 31:13.315
on the planet,

31:13.389 --> 31:15.516
Photonic?

31:15.591 --> 31:19.961
A compendium
Of all human knowledge.

31:20.030 --> 31:24.558
- Oh.
- Area of inquiry?

31:24.634 --> 31:28.126
- Do you know anything about physics?
- Ah, accessing physics.

31:28.205 --> 31:31.072
Mechanical engineering.

31:31.141 --> 31:34.042
Dimensional optics.
Chronography.

31:34.110 --> 31:38.775
Temporal causality,
temporal paradox.

31:38.850 --> 31:41.045
- Time travel?
- Yes.

31:41.118 --> 31:43.746
Accessing science fiction.

31:43.821 --> 31:48.758
No, no. Practical application.
My question is why can't
one change the past?

31:50.761 --> 31:54.595
Because one cannot travel
into the past.

31:58.502 --> 32:01.495
- Wh-What if one could?
- One cannot.

32:01.573 --> 32:05.407
Excuse me, this is something
you should trust me on.

32:05.477 --> 32:08.469
Accessing the writings
Of Isaac Asimov, H.G. Wells,

32:08.547 --> 32:10.742
Harlan Ellison,
Alexander Hartdegen...

32:10.816 --> 32:14.912
- Tell me about him.
- Alexander Hartdegen, 1869 to 1903,

32:14.987 --> 32:17.888
American scientist
given to eccentric postulation.

32:17.956 --> 32:21.256
Found writings include treatise
on the creation of a time machine.

32:21.327 --> 32:25.093
- Tell me about the time machine.
- Time Machine was written
by H.G. Wells in 1 894.

32:25.164 --> 32:29.100
It was a motion picture by
George Pal and a stage musical
By Andrew Lloyd Webber...

32:29.168 --> 32:32.399
- That's not what I mean.
- Would you like to hear
selections from the score?

32:32.472 --> 32:36.238
- No.
- ¶There's a place called tomorrow ¶

32:36.309 --> 32:39.745
¶A place of joy
not of sorrow ¶

32:39.812 --> 32:42.782
¶ Can't you see
it's a place for you and... ¶

32:42.850 --> 32:45.410
Thank you.
That's quite enough.

32:47.054 --> 32:49.648
Will there be anything else?

32:49.723 --> 32:53.056
Uh, no. No, I think I'll have better
luck in a few hundred years.

32:53.127 --> 32:56.119
Live long and prosper.

33:43.746 --> 33:47.113
Sir, where is your
designated evacuation centre?

33:47.183 --> 33:49.209
Sir, you are subject to arrest under martial law...

33:49.286 --> 33:51.686
Please put your hands out, palms together.

33:51.755 --> 33:54.383
You will be held in detention
until your evacuation centre
clears you for transport.

33:54.458 --> 33:57.018
- Wait, wait!
- Just take it easy.

33:57.094 --> 34:00.928
- Hey, we got to get out of here!
- Wait. How did this happen?

34:00.998 --> 34:03.831
The moon. Come on.
Move it.

34:03.900 --> 34:09.235
- That's impossible,
What happened?
- You been living under a rock?

34:09.306 --> 34:12.538
Yes, I've been living
under a rock. Now, tell me.

34:14.879 --> 34:17.677
The demolitions for the lunar colonies
screwed up the orbit, okay?

34:17.748 --> 34:21.708
The moon's breaking up.
All right? Come on.

34:24.922 --> 34:28.824
- Hey! Forget him! Come on!

36:35.292 --> 36:37.783
Emma?

37:06.825 --> 37:09.316
Shh!

38:10.492 --> 38:13.655
Hello?

38:48.097 --> 38:50.827
Hello.

38:50.900 --> 38:54.393
- Don't be afraid.

38:57.441 --> 38:59.705
Oh, wait.
Don't... Don't go.

39:26.304 --> 39:30.536
Wait. I just want to talk to you.

40:03.143 --> 40:08.046
- Hello.

40:08.115 --> 40:11.949
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't understand you.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.418
- Do you know my words?
- Yes.

40:19.460 --> 40:23.055
The lex, the stone language.

40:23.131 --> 40:26.862
The stone language? But do you
understand me? Do you understand me?

40:26.934 --> 40:29.926
We all learn it when we're young,

40:30.004 --> 40:33.735
They tor'jen,
Forget. They forget it.

40:33.808 --> 40:36.538
- But I teach,

40:46.989 --> 40:50.481
- What is he saying?
- They're trying to decide if we
should throw you in the river.

40:50.559 --> 40:55.121
Tell me quickly, and tell me the truth.
Where do you come from?

40:57.366 --> 41:00.927
Well, actually, I'm from here.
Uh, just not from now.

41:01.003 --> 41:06.408
You see, I built a machine that allows
me to travel through time.

41:06.476 --> 41:09.274
I'm from the past.

41:09.345 --> 41:11.176
Oh.

41:29.366 --> 41:31.698
I told them you hit your head...

41:31.769 --> 41:35.535
and you are a wandering idiot.

41:50.355 --> 41:53.688
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the mor,

41:53.758 --> 41:58.991
- The night.
- Oh. I'll come with you.

42:19.986 --> 42:23.752
- Eloi?
- What are your people named?

42:23.823 --> 42:28.157
Well, l-I guess
you'd call us New Yorkers.

42:28.227 --> 42:31.664
New Yorkers.
Are they friendly?

42:31.732 --> 42:34.895
Until you talk to them.

42:36.937 --> 42:41.772
- Tell me about your village.
- It's a very busy place.

42:41.842 --> 42:45.573
Everyone seems to be in a hurry.
And they all wear identical bowler hats.

42:46.947 --> 42:49.541
Little black round things
on their heads.

42:49.616 --> 42:54.554
- What do you do there?
- Well, I was a teacher like Mara.

42:54.622 --> 42:57.750
- And I make things,
- Mealso,

42:57.825 --> 43:02.990
I made a sess'quin'tan with my father.
We still use it.

43:03.064 --> 43:04.861
A sess'quin'tan?

43:04.933 --> 43:08.596
Mara, der'enjen'wenlen?

43:08.670 --> 43:13.472
Sess'quin'tan,
Steps of rope.

43:13.542 --> 43:16.670
Oh, a rope ladder.

43:16.745 --> 43:18.906
We can make one.
I will teach you.

43:21.951 --> 43:25.284
Will you tell me more lon'el
on the next day?

43:25.354 --> 43:28.551
Tomorrow?
Yes, I will.

43:28.624 --> 43:32.116
Why don't you take care
Of this for me tonight?

43:32.194 --> 43:35.596
- Thank you.

43:47.310 --> 43:50.973
- Good night.
- Good night.

43:57.722 --> 44:02.216
Kalen will tire you if you let him.
He's always been questioning.

44:02.293 --> 44:05.785
Our parents were firm,
but it is his way.

44:11.636 --> 44:16.505
- Where are your parents?
- They've gone from this place.

44:16.574 --> 44:19.942
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:41.300 --> 44:45.964
You were right, Philby.
I did go too far.

44:48.207 --> 44:50.698
Sit with me.

44:56.215 --> 45:00.311
Mara, why do you
pull the boats up at night?

45:00.386 --> 45:02.378
Afraid they'll be stolen?

45:02.456 --> 45:06.324
Stolen?
I do not know that word.

45:06.393 --> 45:09.157
Well, are you afraid that
someone will take them?

45:09.229 --> 45:12.665
- It is just more safe this way.
- Oh.

45:12.733 --> 45:17.227
- You must do things to be safe
where you come from?
- Of course,

45:20.541 --> 45:23.875
Or when you come from.

45:23.945 --> 45:27.108
Ah, so I'm not just
a wandering idiot.

45:36.825 --> 45:40.226
Col'mar,

45:40.295 --> 45:42.195
Maybe we could
find some tomorrow.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.966
Flowers?

46:16.700 --> 46:19.863
Alexander, Alexander,

46:41.392 --> 46:45.590
Ah! Morlock!

47:28.808 --> 47:31.743
- Is he all right?
- He had a dream.

47:31.811 --> 47:34.804
Oh. So did I.

47:39.453 --> 47:42.013
I was moving
through a jungle...

47:42.089 --> 47:45.058
And you saw a shape
ahead of you.

47:45.125 --> 47:49.789
Well, a face that...
called my name.

47:49.864 --> 47:52.924
We all have that dream.

47:55.136 --> 47:58.902
- All of you?
- Yes. Now go back asleep.

47:58.974 --> 48:02.637
You're still not well,

48:02.711 --> 48:06.044
What does that mean,
" Morlock"?

48:06.114 --> 48:11.074
A child's dream.
No more.

48:11.152 --> 48:13.985
Go back asleep,

48:36.412 --> 48:40.076
We keep these stones
In many places,

48:40.150 --> 48:44.143
This is the room where my parents
taught me for the first time.

48:53.730 --> 48:57.131
Why do you learn this language
if you don't use it?

48:57.200 --> 49:00.728
It's a tradition we hand down.

49:00.805 --> 49:04.764
It meant something once.
Must be here for a reason.

49:07.045 --> 49:10.845
"One generation passeth away,
and another cometh.

49:10.915 --> 49:14.146
But the earth abideth forever."

49:17.388 --> 49:21.826
Why have you come here?

49:21.894 --> 49:24.362
Why have you travelled
through time?

49:24.430 --> 49:27.422
To have a question answered.

49:27.499 --> 49:30.024
Question?

49:30.102 --> 49:32.935
Yes. Why can't I change the past?

49:33.005 --> 49:35.303
Why would you want to?

49:41.814 --> 49:44.613
You've lost someone.

49:47.287 --> 49:49.778
Some one you loved very much.

50:00.367 --> 50:04.201
- Mara, why are there
no older people here?
- What do you mean?

50:04.270 --> 50:08.435
Older people, your parents' age
or grandparents' age.

50:08.509 --> 50:11.478
They've gone from this place.

50:11.545 --> 50:13.843
You mean, they're dead?

50:13.914 --> 50:16.849
Yes.

50:16.917 --> 50:21.377
All of them?
How is that possible?

50:21.455 --> 50:24.652
There are things
better left not said.

50:24.725 --> 50:29.493
We don't dwell
on the past, Alexander.

50:29.564 --> 50:32.397
- We do something else.
- What?

50:32.467 --> 50:36.096
We remember them...

50:36.171 --> 50:38.662
with these,

50:54.657 --> 50:58.457
Alexander!

51:06.135 --> 51:08.797
Alexander.

51:12.643 --> 51:15.441
- Are you coming to work now?
Come with me...
- No.

51:15.512 --> 51:18.481
Alexander's not well enough.
We're going to see his machine.

51:18.549 --> 51:24.954
- Now?
- Stay with Toren.

51:25.022 --> 51:29.925
- Go the next day, tomorrow.
- I need to see that it's all right.

51:29.993 --> 51:33.521
- This way.

51:35.066 --> 51:37.967
Will you tell me more about
N-New York tonight?

51:38.036 --> 51:40.368
I will.

52:24.918 --> 52:29.412
Oh, good.
It seems fine.

52:29.489 --> 52:32.481
We had quite a ride together.

52:33.560 --> 52:37.395
- It's ready?
- Appears so.

52:37.465 --> 52:41.128
Will you use it now?
Go back to your own time?

52:42.937 --> 52:46.429
Well, l... I guess I could.

52:48.910 --> 52:50.844
Uh...

52:52.580 --> 52:54.514
it seems so long ago.

52:54.582 --> 52:56.743
No. You should go.

52:56.817 --> 53:01.846
And I need to ask,
Will you take Kalen with you?

53:01.924 --> 53:06.725
- Why?
- Alexander, take him away,
back to your time. Will you?

53:06.795 --> 53:10.287
- Mara, why?
- Please. You don't know.

53:10.365 --> 53:13.562
- Take him away from here.

53:13.635 --> 53:16.570
Kalen!

53:25.215 --> 53:27.046
Mara, what's going on?

53:27.116 --> 53:29.676
They're early!
We must get Kalen!

54:15.634 --> 54:17.829
Kalen!

54:19.738 --> 54:22.605
Kalen! Kalen!

56:26.804 --> 56:29.238
Mara!

56:40.886 --> 56:42.911
- Kalen!
- No, stay here.

56:42.988 --> 56:45.456
Stay in the group!

56:58.137 --> 57:00.230
Run!

59:07.338 --> 59:09.671
Mara!

59:20.786 --> 59:23.118
Mara!

59:37.203 --> 59:42.300
Where did they take them?

59:42.375 --> 59:46.106
- We have to follow them.
We have to find them.
- We do not. Col'quin tor,

59:46.179 --> 59:50.548
- Why not?
- This is nem Eloi'tas, our life here.

59:53.687 --> 59:57.953
- How can you just do nothing?
- How can tor'tasal'mor,

59:58.025 --> 01:00:00.391
- It is the day and the night.
- The day and the night.

01:00:00.461 --> 01:00:04.227
- This is the world.

01:00:04.298 --> 01:00:08.598
- Why don't you fight back?

01:00:08.669 --> 01:00:12.230
Fight back. Why not?

01:00:12.306 --> 01:00:17.939
Those who farquil'pax...
fight...

01:00:18.013 --> 01:00:20.743
are taken first.

01:00:26.254 --> 01:00:28.586
- Kalen, do you know
where they're taken?
- No.

01:00:28.657 --> 01:00:30.591
- Do they ever come back?
- No.

01:00:30.659 --> 01:00:32.854
- Has anyone ever followed them?
- I don't know.

01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:35.294
- Well, what about the Morlocks?
There must be a leader.
- We're not supposed to talk.

01:00:35.364 --> 01:00:37.525
Kalen, listen to me.
Listen.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.626
Sometimes we need to
accept what's happening to us
even if we don't want to.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:45.299
And other times we have to fight,
even if we're afraid.

01:00:45.374 --> 01:00:49.276
Now, it's difficult
to understand, I know.

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:52.974
Believe me, I know.
Now, they're afraid,

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:56.314
and I'm asking you not to be.

01:00:56.385 --> 01:00:59.287
So will you tell me
what you know?

01:00:59.356 --> 01:01:03.122
We can save her.
Please.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:09.792
When they go,
we're not supposed to talk about it.

01:01:12.602 --> 01:01:16.504
- But we all know the place.
- What place?

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:21.273
Where the ghosts are.

01:01:43.001 --> 01:01:45.936
Here it is.

01:02:21.474 --> 01:02:26.071
Welcome to VOXsystem,
How may I help you?

01:02:26.147 --> 01:02:30.345
- It's all right.
- How may I serve you?

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:33.784
What can I get you?
Oh, let's see.

01:02:33.854 --> 01:02:36.789
Um, Henry James.
Oh, no. Yes?

01:02:36.857 --> 01:02:42.056
No, no, no, Too depressing, Hemingway,
perhaps? No, Too sweaty,

01:02:42.129 --> 01:02:45.395
Plato, Proust, Pinter,
Poe, Pound?

01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:48.334
No. Complete Works
Of Martha Stewart?

01:02:48.403 --> 01:02:53.841
Ah, I have it!
Jules Verne.

01:02:53.909 --> 01:02:57.106
- Right up your alley, I would think,
- Photonic, right?

01:02:57.179 --> 01:03:00.876
Or what's left of one,
What's left of all of them,

01:03:00.949 --> 01:03:06.080
I am the last, and "these fragments
I have shored against my ruins."

01:03:06.154 --> 01:03:08.123
T, S, Eliot,

01:03:08.191 --> 01:03:12.753
You wouldn't know him yet,
but he is so depressing, yet so divine.

01:03:15.665 --> 01:03:19.692
Oh, I'm sorry. The lending library
is temporarily out of service.

01:03:19.769 --> 01:03:24.763
Not to worry. I have them all right
here... every page of every volume.

01:03:24.841 --> 01:03:27.867
Can you tell me
what's happening here?

01:03:27.944 --> 01:03:31.108
Well, my sources are
no longer fully annotated,

01:03:31.181 --> 01:03:35.618
and my information is somewhat
anecdotal, but I believe
what was once one race...

01:03:35.686 --> 01:03:37.916
is now two.

01:03:37.988 --> 01:03:41.480
One above
and one below.

01:03:41.558 --> 01:03:44.721
Two distinct species
that have evolved.

01:03:44.795 --> 01:03:48.891
- And how do those below survive?
- That is there alquestion, isn't it?

01:03:55.673 --> 01:03:59.871
- I don't believe it.
- Well,

01:03:59.944 --> 01:04:04.108
if you don't like the answers,
you should avoid asking the questions.

01:04:07.385 --> 01:04:11.014
Look at them.
They have no knowledge of the past,

01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:14.753
no ambition for the future,

01:04:14.827 --> 01:04:19.161
- So lucky,
- Why would you say something like that?

01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:26.827
Can you even imagine what it's like
to remember everything?

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:31.275
I remember a six-year-old girl
who asked me about dinosaurs
800,000 years ago.

01:04:31.343 --> 01:04:36.714
I remember the last book
I recommended: Look Homeward,
Angel, by Thomas Wolfe.

01:04:36.783 --> 01:04:41.186
And yes,
I even remember you,

01:04:46.526 --> 01:04:50.360
Time travel:
practical application.

01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:54.628
How do you know about the Morlocks
if you can't leave this place?

01:04:54.701 --> 01:04:59.435
There was one Eloi who managed
to escape, He told me everything,

01:05:03.778 --> 01:05:08.511
We spent years together,
just talking.

01:05:09.984 --> 01:05:14.546
The conversation's a little spotty now,
but I do remember.

01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:19.651
- It's good to have a friend.
- Then you can help us find the Morlocks,

01:05:19.728 --> 01:05:21.696
find Mara.

01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:28.667
And if the truth is so horrible,
and will haunt your dreams for all time?

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:34.105
Well, I think I'm used to that.

01:05:38.715 --> 01:05:44.017
My friend said he came from the east,
from the jungle.

01:05:45.321 --> 01:05:49.223
- Will you describe it?
- I don't have to.

01:05:51.461 --> 01:05:55.158
Just follow the breathing.

01:06:27.799 --> 01:06:33.328
In the dream, we're moving
Toward it, but I think it was
meant to keep us away,

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:41.902
- I might just go in by myself.
- No.

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.918
Mara would be very cross with me
if you got hurt. Now, I'll find her,

01:06:46.986 --> 01:06:51.082
but I need you to go back
to the village and light a fire
so we can find our way home.

01:06:51.157 --> 01:06:54.149
- All right? Will you do that for me?
- I lost your pocket watch.

01:06:54.226 --> 01:06:58.424
They took it from my room.

01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:00.931
I'm sorry.

01:07:05.337 --> 01:07:08.273
Why would they take it?

01:08:01.663 --> 01:08:04.598
Oh. Stupid.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:13.326
Mara?

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.856
Mara?

01:11:39.925 --> 01:11:41.984
Mara.

01:11:43.962 --> 01:11:45.896
Mara?

01:11:52.905 --> 01:11:57.638
Come a little closer.
I don't bite.

01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:15.795
Do I surprise you?

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:19.264
- A little. Yes.
- Hmm.

01:12:19.333 --> 01:12:25.203
We weren't always like this.
After the moon fell from the sky,

01:12:25.272 --> 01:12:29.368
the Earth could no longer
sustain the species.

01:12:29.443 --> 01:12:32.413
Some managed to stay above,

01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:36.007
The rest of us
Escaped underground,

01:12:36.084 --> 01:12:41.522
Then centuries later,
when we tried to re-emerge
into the sun again, we couldn't,

01:12:41.589 --> 01:12:47.323
So we bred ourselves
into castes.

01:12:47.395 --> 01:12:50.956
Some to be our eyes and ears.

01:12:51.032 --> 01:12:55.367
- Some to be our muscles and sinews.
- You mean, your hunters.

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:03.140
Yes. Bred to be predators,
but bred also to be controlled.

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:07.273
You see,
my caste concentrated...

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:10.648
on expanding
our cerebral abilities.

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:16.056
- You control their thoughts.
- Not just theirs.

01:13:17.794 --> 01:13:21.025
The Eloi.

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:25.466
So it's not enough that you hunt
them down like animals.

01:13:25.535 --> 01:13:29.528
- That's their role here.
- To be your food?

01:13:31.475 --> 01:13:33.602
Yes.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:38.047
And for those who are suitable,
to be breeding vessels...

01:13:38.115 --> 01:13:41.278
for our other colonies.

01:13:41.352 --> 01:13:45.652
You see,
I'm just one of many,

01:13:45.723 --> 01:13:50.023
I don't understand how you can sit there
and speak so coldly about this.

01:13:53.431 --> 01:13:57.492
Have you not considered the human
cost of-of what it is you're doing?

01:13:57.568 --> 01:14:00.732
We all pay a price...

01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:04.475
Alexander.

01:14:14.987 --> 01:14:18.150
Don't worry.
You're safe.

01:14:19.525 --> 01:14:22.552
I control them.

01:14:22.629 --> 01:14:26.065
Without that control,

01:14:26.132 --> 01:14:29.829
they would
exhaust the food supply...

01:14:29.903 --> 01:14:32.770
in a matter of months.

01:14:32.839 --> 01:14:36.832
Food supply?
They're human beings!

01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:39.071
Who are you...

01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:43.048
to question 800,000 years...

01:14:46.887 --> 01:14:48.718
of evolution?

01:14:48.789 --> 01:14:52.691
- This is... This is a perversion
of every natural law.

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:58.665
And what is time travel
But your pathetic attempt to
control the world around you,

01:14:58.732 --> 01:15:03.864
- Your futile effort to have
a question answered?

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:07.466
Do you think I don't know you,
Alexander?

01:15:09.044 --> 01:15:13.310
I can look
inside your memories,

01:15:13.381 --> 01:15:17.613
your nightmares,
your dreams.

01:15:17.686 --> 01:15:23.090
You're a man haunted by
those two most terrible words:

01:15:23.158 --> 01:15:27.118
What if?

01:16:14.178 --> 01:16:17.147
Look at you!

01:16:17.215 --> 01:16:20.343
- And a long ponytail...
- Daddy!

01:16:20.418 --> 01:16:24.946
- Who's that? Is it Daddy?
- Daddy!
- Long ponytail,

01:16:25.023 --> 01:16:29.483
And we're still having lots of fun,

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:33.053
- Right, Right,

01:16:46.078 --> 01:16:49.172
Da-da! Daddy.

01:16:50.482 --> 01:16:54.817
You built your time machine
because of Emma's death.

01:16:54.888 --> 01:16:58.415
If she had lived,
it would never have existed.

01:16:58.491 --> 01:17:02.291
So how could you use your machine
to go back to save her?

01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:06.992
You are
the inescapable result...

01:17:07.067 --> 01:17:09.865
of your tragedy,

01:17:09.936 --> 01:17:12.461
just as I...

01:17:12.539 --> 01:17:17.876
am the inescapable result...
of you.

01:17:57.086 --> 01:18:01.352
You have your answer.
Now go.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:39.186
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

01:18:45.203 --> 01:18:49.765
- We all have our time machines,
don't we?

01:18:52.177 --> 01:18:55.374
Those that take us back
are memories...

01:18:56.447 --> 01:18:59.814
and those that carry us forward...

01:19:02.521 --> 01:19:04.955
are dreams.

01:19:10.029 --> 01:19:13.726
- You're forgetting one thing.
- Huh?

01:19:18.437 --> 01:19:21.600
- What if?

01:22:48.757 --> 01:22:53.251
- What are you doing with it?
- Changing the future.

01:22:55.898 --> 01:22:58.128
Come on.

01:23:37.508 --> 01:23:40.739
Wait. Wait here.

01:25:12.274 --> 01:25:14.242
Go.

01:25:27.756 --> 01:25:29.986
- Hurry!

01:25:36.399 --> 01:25:38.833
Huh?

01:25:51.281 --> 01:25:53.442
Alexander!

01:26:40.366 --> 01:26:44.268
I'm sorry
you lost your machine.

01:26:45.972 --> 01:26:51.171
Oh, it's all right.
It was only a machine.

01:27:13.267 --> 01:27:16.532
"The congregation rose and stared...

01:27:16.603 --> 01:27:20.733
"while the three dead boys
came marching up the aisle...

01:27:20.808 --> 01:27:23.937
"Tom in their lead,
Joe next,

01:27:24.012 --> 01:27:28.005
"and Huck,
a ruin of drooping rags,

01:27:28.083 --> 01:27:31.416
- "sneaking sheepishly in the rear.

01:27:31.486 --> 01:27:36.822
"They had hid in an unused gallery,
listening to their own funeral sermon.

01:27:36.891 --> 01:27:40.224
Aunt Polly, Mary and the Harpers
threw themselves upon them..."

01:27:40.295 --> 01:27:43.390
This is the place.

01:27:43.466 --> 01:27:46.162
So it is.

01:27:51.574 --> 01:27:55.704
- But there's nothing here.
- Well, it was different then.

01:27:55.778 --> 01:27:58.906
My laboratory
was all around here.

01:27:58.981 --> 01:28:02.940
The kitchen was up there
where that tree is.

01:28:04.787 --> 01:28:08.189
Not that Mrs. Watchit
ever let me go in there.

01:28:11.862 --> 01:28:15.855
I don't know
what to tell you, sir.

01:28:15.932 --> 01:28:18.867
He's been gone
this whole week.

01:28:18.935 --> 01:28:22.029
And you've no idea
where he went?

01:28:22.105 --> 01:28:25.074
- No, sir.
- This would be my greenhouse,

01:28:25.142 --> 01:28:28.601
There was a garden outside.

01:28:28.679 --> 01:28:31.773
Gren 'tormar'tas?

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.942
Yes.

01:28:34.018 --> 01:28:37.647
- I'm glad.
- Sir?

01:28:37.722 --> 01:28:40.384
I'm glad he's gone.

01:28:40.458 --> 01:28:44.588
Maybe he's finally found someplace
where he can be happy.

01:28:45.797 --> 01:28:49.734
- This was my home.
- His home.

01:28:49.802 --> 01:28:52.236
Long ago.

01:28:54.673 --> 01:28:58.871
You know, Molly and I were talking
about engaging a housekeeper,

01:28:58.944 --> 01:29:02.072
someone to live with us
and help take care of Jamie.

01:29:02.147 --> 01:29:05.014
Would you be interested?

01:29:07.286 --> 01:29:11.781
- Perhaps just until the master returns.
- Of course.

01:29:11.858 --> 01:29:15.885
- But there'd be some changes made.
I run a tight house.

01:29:15.962 --> 01:29:20.922
Oh, I have no doubt of that. I'll call
by in the morning, and we'll arrange it.

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:24.959
- Good night, Mrs. Watchit.
- Good night, Mr. Philby.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:44.880
- Godspeed, my fine lad.

01:29:44.959 --> 01:29:46.893
Godspeed.
