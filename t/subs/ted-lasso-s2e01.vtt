WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:04.086
And we're in the final minute
of added time.

00:05.506 --> 00:09.218
AFC Richmond and Nottingham Forest are
level with two goals apiece.

00:10.344 --> 00:15.182
Obisanya switches play.
He finds Rojas, who has room.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.265
Oh!

00:19.520 --> 00:20.729
And it's a penalty!

00:22.064 --> 00:25.776
A giant opportunity for the Greyhounds
to change their club's tide here.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.110
Nice pass, Sam!

00:27.653 --> 00:28.654
Here we go, Dani!

00:28.737 --> 00:29.905
-Yeah! Yes!
-Nice, nice.

00:29.988 --> 00:34.034
Huge relief for Colin Hughes after
he was liable for Forest's equalizer.

00:35.536 --> 00:38.413
Richmond has started the season
with seven straight ties…

00:38.497 --> 00:40.749
and if this match ends in a draw,
they will tie the record,

00:40.832 --> 00:44.586
which is currently
a tie between Southampton and Swansea.

00:44.670 --> 00:45.838
Chris, can you even imagine

00:45.921 --> 00:48.590
starting a season
with seven consecutive draws?

00:48.674 --> 00:50.133
I sure can, Arlo.

00:50.217 --> 00:53.220
And that's because I'm a right-brained
dominant with a knack for make-believe.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.640
Is it okay if I pray?

00:56.723 --> 00:59.643
Yeah, of course. But to which god
and in what language, you know?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.144
You could cross your fingers, make a wish.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.229
There you go.

01:03.856 --> 01:06.817
The Richmond faithful,
who've recently gone through so much,

01:06.900 --> 01:09.194
still fervently behind their club.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.154
Keep on him.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.242
Go on. Yeah!

01:17.369 --> 01:19.538
And a hush falls over Nelson Road…

01:23.041 --> 01:25.169
With the exception of
Richmond's venerable mascot,

01:25.252 --> 01:28.297
Earl Greyhound, howling his encouragement.

01:31.758 --> 01:36.305
Will Dani Rojas deliver the good boy
their first win of the season?

01:36.388 --> 01:37.514
Please, please, please, please.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.765
Come on, Dani.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.103
Football is life.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.221
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my God.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.223
I promise that's not what I wished for.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.792
That poor creature. It's so tragic.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.085
Awful turn of events.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.337
You don't think that people will hate us
because of it, do you?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.839
Well, it was obviously
a horrible accident,

02:51.922 --> 02:54.091
but I guess that one perk of being
in a lower division now

02:54.174 --> 02:56.468
is that not every game is televised.

02:56.552 --> 02:58.428
Yes, but, Higgins, the Internet.

02:58.929 --> 03:00.722
Oh, right, the goddamn Internet.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.016
Twitter is going bonkers. Look.

03:04.059 --> 03:06.812
Oh, God. Did we really make
Michael Jordan cry?

03:06.895 --> 03:08.605
-Did you write a statement for Ted?
-Yeah, I did.

03:08.689 --> 03:12.442
But then he said, "Now, don't you fret,
Boba Fett." He's got it covered.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.527
Okay.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.238
-Coach!
-All right, Marcus,

03:16.321 --> 03:17.698
-what do you got for me?
-Coach Lasso,

03:17.781 --> 03:19.992
how are you feeling about
the team's efforts today?

03:20.075 --> 03:22.536
Well, I feel like everyone played
their hearts out, especially Sam.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.829
Just gets better and better every game.

03:23.912 --> 03:26.957
He's really helping us fill
that giant Roy Kent void, you know.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.001
And how many more matches you think
can end in a draw

03:29.084 --> 03:30.252
before you hit the panic button?

03:30.335 --> 03:33.297
Well, Marcus, there's two buttons
I never like to hit, all right?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.631
And that's "panic" and "snooze."

03:34.715 --> 03:36.175
Who else?

03:36.258 --> 03:37.968
What about this fella right here?

03:38.635 --> 03:41.388
-Trent Crimm--
-The Independent.

03:42.264 --> 03:46.435
I was wondering if you had any comments
on Earl, the dog Dani Rojas killed today.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.023
Trent Crimm, bringing that heat.

03:55.903 --> 03:56.904
Yeah.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.783
Well, when I was three years old,
I got attacked by our neighbor's dog.

04:02.326 --> 04:04.912
I-I don't remember it happening,
but my mother said it was pretty--

04:04.995 --> 04:06.205
pretty scary, you know.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.125
I do remember being afraid of dogs
while growing up though.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.669
Like if I was at a friend's house
for a sleepover or something,

04:12.753 --> 04:16.173
they'd have to keep their family dog
outside, otherwise I'd bawl my eyes out.

04:18.716 --> 04:22.721
Then in high school, our neighbor,
Mr. Grady, well, his wife passed away.

04:23.722 --> 04:25.933
And he was real sad about that,
as you can imagine,

04:26.517 --> 04:29.520
and he just kinda stopped
taking care of their dog.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.898
Same one that bit me. His name was Hank.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.570
And so I started looking after him,
you know.

04:38.654 --> 04:41.573
Feeding him, taking him on walks,
playing fetch, all that fun stuff.

04:42.658 --> 04:45.327
Eventually, Mr. Grady's son moved
his dad into a nursing home,

04:45.410 --> 04:48.247
and he asked if I wanted to keep Hank,
and I was like, "Yeah. Heck, yeah."

04:49.623 --> 04:52.292
And then a year or so after that
we had to put Hank to sleep.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.589
It's funny to think about
the things in your life…

04:58.507 --> 05:02.177
that can make you cry just knowing
that they existed,

05:02.261 --> 05:04.054
can then become
the same thing that make you cry

05:04.137 --> 05:05.681
knowing that they're now gone.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.855
I think those things come into our lives…

05:14.231 --> 05:16.191
to help us get from one place
to a better one.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.281
And I hope we helped Earl do just that.

05:23.574 --> 05:25.784
We gonna miss him around here
a whole bunch. Yeah.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.083
And how's Dani doing?

05:33.792 --> 05:34.793
I haven't spoken with him yet,

05:34.877 --> 05:37.462
but I just hope he's not being
too hard on himself, you know.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.176
He's been like this for 20 minutes.

05:45.637 --> 05:47.139
He's gonna use all the hot water.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.558
-Yeah.
-Yeah, you're right.

06:01.612 --> 06:03.655
Hey, Dani. What ya doing?

06:04.656 --> 06:06.283
Washing the death off of me.

06:14.124 --> 06:16.543
Well, I-- I recommend
you use a little soap.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.547
Helps get the eternal rest out of those
tough-to-reach places, you know.

06:20.631 --> 06:21.882
Gracias, Coach.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.428
Well, hey, don't forget,
football is life, right?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.849
I know. It used to be.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.105
I got nothing.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.615
Okay, so, fellas,

06:46.698 --> 06:49.284
let's go ahead and give Dani
a little bit of space right now, yeah?

06:49.368 --> 06:50.953
Y'all don't mind showering at home, do ya?

06:51.036 --> 06:52.663
Coach, if it's okay with you,

06:52.746 --> 06:54.540
some of us prefer
to take long baths at home.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.542
Yeah, yeah.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.252
Oh. Yeah, no, okay, that'll work too.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.671
Oh, and hey, way to play out there today.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.381
Y'all kicked their butts
from soup to nuts.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.882
Don't worry, we gonna get a W soon.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.176
We'll see you goldfish on Monday.

07:06.844 --> 07:07.845
Goldfish?

07:07.928 --> 07:11.014
Oh, it means to forget our mistakes
and failures and just move on.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.560
But I didn't make any mistakes.
Only you played poorly.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.648
Hey, guys, Jan Maas is not being rude.

07:19.731 --> 07:20.732
He's just being Dutch.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.902
-Yeah, yeah.
-True.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.704
I'm telling you,
all these ties are my fault.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.623
It's straight up celestial payback
for the Man City game.

07:36.707 --> 07:39.626
There I was wishing and hoping
for a freaking tie,

07:39.710 --> 07:41.295
and now the karma police are making good

07:41.378 --> 07:43.547
on showing me what I get
when I mess with them.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.924
The team's playing well, Ted,
just a little unlucky, that's all.

07:46.008 --> 07:49.303
"Unlucky." Yeah. Man, I love the way
y'all use that word over here.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.805
Back home, if a team was playing poorly,
we don't call 'em unlucky.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.932
-What do we call 'em, Coach?
-New York Jets.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.642
-There it is.
-Hey, Coach.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.978
Sorry to interrupt.
Can I leave a little early today?

07:58.061 --> 08:00.480
But part of your job is to stay
until the whole team's gone.

08:00.564 --> 08:03.442
No, yes, of course. It's just,
it's my mum's 50th birthday--

08:03.525 --> 08:04.943
Oh. Oh.

08:05.027 --> 08:07.154
And what position does your mum play
on the team again?

08:08.530 --> 08:11.325
It's okay, Will. Tell your mom
a happy birthday from all of us,

08:11.408 --> 08:13.619
and if she ever wants to try out
for the team, she's more than welcome.

08:13.702 --> 08:14.912
Lovely.

08:21.043 --> 08:22.294
You gotta stay on 'em.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.755
Pressure makes pearls, right?

08:26.215 --> 08:27.341
Wait, that's wrong.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.885
It's diamonds-- Shit! I messed it up.

08:29.968 --> 08:31.512
No, you didn't mess it up.
You were just--

08:31.595 --> 08:33.096
-Unlucky.
-Yes!

08:36.683 --> 08:37.893
Thanks.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.645
That's odd.

08:39.727 --> 08:43.565
We just received a giant food delivery
from our rivals over at Brentford F.C.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.192
That's nice. What kind of food?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.276
Thai.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.278
Oh, now I get it.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.782
-Howdy, y'all.
-Ted!

08:52.407 --> 08:54.660
What do you say to a cocktail,
Coach Lasso?

08:54.743 --> 08:56.411
Oh, the same thing I'd say to Diane Sawyer

08:56.495 --> 08:58.413
if she ever asked me out on a date:
"Yes, please."

08:59.164 --> 09:02.376
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

09:03.001 --> 09:03.961
How you feeling?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.796
Well, Keeley, I feel like

09:05.879 --> 09:08.215
a bigger loser than
the biggest loser from The Biggest Loser.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.759
Oh, look on the bright side, Ted.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.011
We are still undefeated.

09:13.095 --> 09:14.555
Okay, sure. Thank you.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.098
How's Dani doing?

09:17.432 --> 09:19.059
Oh, he's a little shell-shocked,

09:19.142 --> 09:21.103
but Dani's a lot like
an expensive tape measure.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.313
-He snaps back real quick.
-Yeah.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.815
What about Earl's owner?
He doing all right?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.859
-Yeah, fortunately he is.
-Oh, good.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.570
Yes, and you're now looking at
the very new, very generous,

09:29.653 --> 09:33.824
very guilt-riddled benefactor
of Richmond's largest dog shelter.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.534
Barkingham Palace.

09:36.618 --> 09:37.870
It's a good name.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.289
-To Earl.
-To Earl.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.623
To Earl.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.001
Okay, I should go.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.753
I promised the boys we'd watch
Empire Strikes Back tonight,

09:46.837 --> 09:48.547
and I have to get my thoughts together

09:48.630 --> 09:51.008
for when they ask
about Luke and Leia making out.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.135
-Oh, right.
-Wish me luck.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.469
Good luck, Higgins.

09:54.553 --> 09:55.596
Bye, Leslie.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.432
-Hey. May the force be with you.
-And also with you.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.516
All right.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.186
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, is that him?

10:02.269 --> 10:03.812
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Come on! Oh, good!

10:04.897 --> 10:06.148
Okay.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.524
Hey, him who?

10:08.483 --> 10:10.402
-And?
-Well, I mean…

10:10.485 --> 10:12.654
-Okay, but?
-Oh, no. Totally.

10:12.738 --> 10:14.489
-Good, I'm proud of you.
-Thanks.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.866
Am I allowed to speak yet?

10:16.450 --> 10:18.744
Oh, sorry, Ted.
It's just a little bit of girl talk

10:18.827 --> 10:22.247
about a gentleman suitor
I've gone out with a few times.

10:22.331 --> 10:25.083
Nice. A little girl talk. I get it.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.002
What's his name--

10:30.672 --> 10:33.300
Are you guys up for a double date
next week? Let him prove his mettle.

10:33.383 --> 10:36.094
-Abso-fucking-lutely.
-Can you ask Roy if he's free?

10:36.178 --> 10:37.429
-He's free. Don't worry.
-Okay, cool.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.223
Hey, did Roy come to the game today?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.433
Oh, no, he didn't. Sorry, Ted.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.894
Oh, no, that's okay. I'm sure
he'll swing by at some point, right?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.022
Hey, he knows he's always got a ticket
waiting for him at will call, yeah?

10:47.105 --> 10:48.106
-Yeah.
-Good, okay.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.859
And don't forget,
I don't put it under his name.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.903
I don't want folks messing with him.
It's under an alias.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.406
Like, last week it was
Loretta Lynn, this week was Dolly Parton,

10:56.490 --> 10:59.117
and next week is, if I remember correctly,
Shania Twain.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.369
Just brilliant.

11:00.452 --> 11:01.537
And it's nothing personal.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.914
It's just that he's been so busy
with this new coaching gig.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.291
You listen to me!

11:06.875 --> 11:10.337
You play like that next week,
you can kiss the trophy goodbye,

11:10.420 --> 11:14.550
'cause today, you all played like
a bunch of little pricks!

11:14.633 --> 11:15.634
You hear me?

11:15.717 --> 11:17.344
Yes, Coach!

11:17.427 --> 11:20.389
Except for Kokoruda. Way to put
your body on the line out there.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.391
You know it, Coach.

11:22.474 --> 11:25.310
All right,
Monika's mum brought orange slices.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.396
Don't eat the peels, you animals.
Off you go.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.065
-Keeley!
-Hey, Phoebs!

11:31.525 --> 11:33.944
Coach Kent. They're eight years old.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.655
-You can't call them little pricks.
-Sorry, Ms. Bowen.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.365
Even when they're being little pricks.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.242
See you on Monday at school, girls.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.952
-Bye, Ms. Bowen.
-Hey, babe.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.036
Bye, Ms. Bowen.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.331
-All right, who wants some hot chocolate?
-Me!

11:46.415 --> 11:48.208
-I do.
-Yeah, let's go!

11:53.088 --> 11:54.673
Oh! Before I forget,

11:54.756 --> 11:57.176
Rebecca wanted to see if we could do
some double date action next week.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.635
Fucking hell.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.972
Bad word, Uncle Roy. You owe me one quid.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.223
Put it on my tab.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.350
-Can you hold this, please?
-Course.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.102
Come on. It'll be fun.

12:08.687 --> 12:10.564
-Fine.
-Thank you.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.193
Phoebe, how was the match today?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.320
-Outstanding.
-Yeah?

12:16.403 --> 12:18.906
I got a red card
for elbowing a girl in her neck.

12:19.615 --> 12:20.908
And I'm very proud.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.493
What?

12:25.078 --> 12:28.040
Well, I know that you guys
are just gonna smash it next week.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.499
Me too.

12:30.459 --> 12:31.877
So once the season's over,

12:31.960 --> 12:33.545
you're gonna have more time
to see some friends, right?

12:34.129 --> 12:35.339
I see friends all the time.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.715
I know. You got your yoga mums.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.844
Don't you ever want anything more than
sitting in child's pose,

12:40.928 --> 12:43.305
getting buzzed on rosé,
and gossiping about reality TV

12:43.388 --> 12:45.432
with a bunch of women
that know nothing about you?

12:45.516 --> 12:47.226
No, I love it.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.314
Sky Sports reached out again.

12:52.397 --> 12:53.565
No.

12:53.649 --> 12:54.650
I think it's a good idea.

12:54.733 --> 12:58.487
Last time I did one of your good ideas,
I made a fucking fool of myself.

12:58.570 --> 13:02.783
Your retirement press conference was
beautiful, Roy. People loved it.

13:02.866 --> 13:04.493
It got, like, 15 million views.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.871
Wait, so your way of alleviating
my embarrassment is to tell me

13:07.955 --> 13:10.457
how many millions of people have
seen me look like a knob?

13:11.875 --> 13:12.876
Good point.

13:13.669 --> 13:16.463
I just wanna go on record saying that
I think you'd be an amazing pundit.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.715
I don't wanna be
a fucking football pundit,

13:18.799 --> 13:20.717
sat on fucking telly
in a dumb fucking suit

13:20.801 --> 13:22.010
like a know-it-all twat.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.846
It's a shit job for shit people.

13:23.929 --> 13:27.307
I'd rather shit out my own fucking mouth
than do that fucking shit.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.434
Got it.

13:30.185 --> 13:31.478
Phoebs, where we at now?

13:32.062 --> 13:35.941
£1,236.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.068
Impressive.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.030
And it's déjà vu all over again

13:42.114 --> 13:46.118
as Dani Rojas has
another injury-time penalty kick

13:46.201 --> 13:49.663
to put Richmond in the win column
for the first time this season.

13:51.123 --> 13:53.959
If he can get it past
this adorable goalkeeper.

13:57.546 --> 14:02.134
Oh, gamesmanship from the keeper.
How will Rojas respond?

14:12.144 --> 14:15.063
Football is death!

14:20.444 --> 14:21.445
Oh, come in.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.613
Morning, boss.

14:22.696 --> 14:23.864
Oh, hi, Ted.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.451
Yikes. I haven't seen someone
that disappointed to see me

14:27.534 --> 14:30.245
since I wore a red baseball cap
to a Planned Parenthood fundraiser.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.917
Sorry, Ted. You're right.
I-- I was just hoping you were Keeley.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.461
That's okay. I wish I was Keeley
three, four times a day.

14:37.544 --> 14:38.754
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.173
Let me guess. You got a fever for
the flavor of a little girl talk?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.426
Well, shoot,
why don't you let me take a crack at it?

14:44.510 --> 14:45.844
-Really?
-Yeah, why not?

14:45.928 --> 14:47.804
Oh. Okay, what the hell.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.349
So this chap I've been seeing, John.

14:50.432 --> 14:51.642
Stamos?

14:52.142 --> 14:54.102
No, his name's John Wingsnight.

14:54.186 --> 14:55.187
-Okay.
-But that's not the point.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.564
Now hold on a second.
His name's John Wingsnight?

14:57.648 --> 14:58.982
-Yes.
-Like at a sports bar?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.235
Like, "Monday night's wings night
down at PJ Flatts," like that?

15:01.318 --> 15:03.111
Ted, would you please stop?

15:03.195 --> 15:05.489
Rule number one:
Even though it's called "girl talk,"

15:05.572 --> 15:07.533
sometimes it needs to be
more like, "Girl, listen."

15:07.616 --> 15:10.118
Got it. Learning on the fly here.
Come on. Hit me.

15:10.202 --> 15:14.790
All right, thank you. So, John,
I mean-- I mean, he's a wonderful man.

15:15.666 --> 15:18.418
-He's very handsome, successful.
-Nice.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.337
-Not shy.
-Is he nice to you?

15:21.296 --> 15:23.674
Yes. Yes, very.

15:23.757 --> 15:25.843
Good. Yeah, he sounds great.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.719
So I'm confused. Is there a problem here?

15:27.803 --> 15:28.804
Well…

15:31.056 --> 15:32.266
Actually, I suppose not.

15:33.225 --> 15:34.226
Okay.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.770
Okay, so rule number two is

15:36.854 --> 15:39.857
sometimes girl talk can just be
blabbing away about stuff,

15:39.940 --> 15:42.734
and nothing has to really change,
and no one has to solve anything?

15:42.818 --> 15:43.944
Yeah, that's exactly right.

15:44.027 --> 15:45.362
I love it. Let's keep going.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.447
Right, so… Come.

15:48.740 --> 15:50.075
Okay.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.870
Hey, sorry I'm late, fellas.

15:52.953 --> 15:55.455
I was helping the boss pick out
a nail polish color for her date tonight.

15:55.539 --> 15:57.666
My favorite's the blue,
but I think they all kinda rock.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.084
What do guys you think?

16:00.002 --> 16:02.254
-What's wrong?
-We got a situation, Coach.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.423
He's underselling.
We have a Shakespearean fucking tragedy.

16:04.506 --> 16:05.716
Take it easy, Dani.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.051
Come on, Dani. One more time, yeah?
Have another go.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.346
Come on, Dani. Come on.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.025
How many has he missed?

16:23.567 --> 16:24.568
All of them.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.362
Oh, boy. Okay. Hey, Dani!

16:28.405 --> 16:30.032
Come on, son. Let's take a walk.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.660
Wow. We're watching
the end of someone's career.

16:33.744 --> 16:34.745
Not now, Jan.

16:36.163 --> 16:38.999
-Sorry, Coach.
-No, no need to apologize.

16:39.082 --> 16:44.129
Dani, what happened between you and Earl,
that wasn't your fault, you know.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.633
You suffered an unlikely
and tragic coincidence.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.676
Not too dissimilar from those seen

16:49.760 --> 16:52.596
throughout Paul Thomas Anderson's
1999 opus, Magnolia.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.766
Is that Tom Cruise
with a little, tiny ponytail?

16:55.849 --> 16:58.352
No, Dani. I think you're thinking about
The Last Samurai.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.562
He's got a little, tiny ponytail
in Magnolia too, Coach.

17:00.646 --> 17:01.772
Oh, thank you, Coach.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.357
My apologies, Dani.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.068
Tom Cruise was rocking a little,
tiny ponytail in both those films.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.528
-Okay.
-Point is,

17:07.611 --> 17:09.613
it's a tragic occurrence, all right?

17:10.696 --> 17:11.949
A one-time thing.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.742
So let's get away from the bad mojo
coming off that penalty box and,

17:14.826 --> 17:16.078
you know, have some fun.

17:16.161 --> 17:17.788
Let's kick some corners, right?

17:17.871 --> 17:18.872
-Right.
-Yeah?

17:18.955 --> 17:21.375
Hey, fellas! Line up for Midnight Poutine!

17:22.166 --> 17:24.711
Yeah, there we go.
Help you get your feel back.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.425
-All right, Dani.
-Okay, Coach.

17:30.509 --> 17:32.177
Take a deep breath, yeah?

17:32.803 --> 17:34.513
I want you to picture the shot.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.392
Be the ball, Dani. Now kick it.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.149
Oh, boy.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.026
That's all right. That's all right.

17:49.319 --> 17:53.240
Well, fellas, I am more stumped than
Paul Bunyan's local forest, you know th--

17:53.323 --> 17:54.324
That hurt.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.327
Any ideas?

17:57.411 --> 18:00.622
If Dani needs motivation, we could always
just show him his goddamn paycheck.

18:02.416 --> 18:05.043
I mean, that's a tad aggressive, you know.

18:05.127 --> 18:07.462
But hey, I shouldn't bring
an umbrella to a brainstorm,

18:07.546 --> 18:08.964
so I appreciate
you getting the ball rolling, Nate.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.340
Yeah.

18:10.424 --> 18:12.843
Seems like the first thing we need to do
is define the issue, yeah?

18:12.926 --> 18:14.011
True that.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.971
I think we already know what it is,
don't we, Coach?

18:16.054 --> 18:17.431
What you talking about, Willis?

18:18.557 --> 18:20.267
Hey, you're not supposed
to say that out loud.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.727
Which is why I wrote it down.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.270
"The yips"?

18:24.897 --> 18:26.273
What are the yips?

18:26.356 --> 18:27.941
Are you kidding me, you two?

18:29.735 --> 18:31.820
We don't say the Y-word out loud,
you understand?

18:31.904 --> 18:33.697
It's like saying Macbeth in a theater,

18:33.780 --> 18:35.532
or Voldemort at Hogwarts, or…

18:35.616 --> 18:37.201
-Soccer in England.
-Bingo.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.870
But what are the yips?

18:39.953 --> 18:41.413
It's when, just out of nowhere,

18:41.496 --> 18:44.583
an athlete suddenly can't do
the basic fundamentals of their sport.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.460
Yeah, you know,
like Chuck Knoblauch's throw to first,

18:46.543 --> 18:48.962
or Charles Barkley's golf swing.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.632
You guys know what I mean.

18:53.634 --> 18:56.053
Sometimes being here is like
living in a foreign country.

18:56.136 --> 18:57.679
-You ever feel that way?
-Yeah.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.389
Ted, what are your thoughts on therapy?

19:01.767 --> 19:05.103
General apprehension and a modest
Midwestern skepticism. Why do you ask?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.606
Well, maybe we should
bring in a sports psychologist.

19:07.689 --> 19:10.901
I know a lot of other clubs have had
tremendous success with that.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.779
It's not a bad idea, Coach.

19:18.992 --> 19:19.993
Okay.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.080
Yeah, hold on.

19:23.163 --> 19:26.792
Let me think here.
Let me get my thinking thing on, okay.

19:28.252 --> 19:29.294
Yeah, let's do it.

19:32.798 --> 19:36.134
And now, we're nose-to-nose with
one another, and half of me is thinking,

19:36.218 --> 19:37.886
"Just kick this jerk in the balls

19:37.970 --> 19:39.471
and when he bends over,
give him a knee to the nose

19:39.555 --> 19:41.682
and be done with it,
'cause screw this guy."

19:41.765 --> 19:44.393
And the other half of me is thinking,
"But it's Martin Short.

19:44.476 --> 19:46.144
You love Martin Short."

19:46.770 --> 19:48.981
Well, the next thing you know,
this tiny American woman says,

19:49.064 --> 19:50.482
"Is that it?"

19:50.566 --> 19:53.443
And sure enough, there it was,
wedged between the couch cushions,

19:53.527 --> 19:55.696
-Martin Short's wallet.
-Martin Short's wallet.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.614
I mean, he didn't steal it.

19:57.698 --> 19:59.908
-No!
-Wow, that's insane.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.536
That's madness.
Could I get another one, please?

20:02.619 --> 20:05.664
God, I never knew that meet and greets
at Broadway shows could be

20:05.747 --> 20:07.708
such hotbeds for, like, almost violence.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.919
Oh, big-time. But who cares about
Martin Short when you're sitting next to

20:11.003 --> 20:14.047
"He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where, Roy Kent,"

20:14.131 --> 20:16.258
-Roy Kent!
-John's football-mad.

20:16.341 --> 20:18.927
Oh, terrific. Who do you support?

20:19.011 --> 20:21.388
Well, I bounce back and forward
between United and City.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.223
Whichever club's winning, typically.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.309
-I love it.
-Sounds like it.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.852
So, how's retirement, Roy?

20:26.935 --> 20:29.688
I mean, I can't imagine
how different your life must be now.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.231
You must miss it all like mad, yeah?

20:32.149 --> 20:33.442
I don't.

20:34.109 --> 20:35.444
So what are you doing now then?

20:35.527 --> 20:36.987
Oh, you know, busy, busy.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.531
I'm actually doing a bit of coaching
at the moment.

20:39.615 --> 20:42.993
-I hadn't heard that. Fantastic.
-Yeah. We got a cup final next week.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.620
In October… W-What cup's that?

20:45.204 --> 20:46.914
West London under-nine girls.

20:48.332 --> 20:49.625
Can I get another one, please?

20:50.125 --> 20:52.586
He's actually had
an offer from Sky Sports to be a pundit.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.672
Oh, of course you have.
You'd be amazing at that job.

20:55.756 --> 20:57.049
I love that idea.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.344
I couldn't agree more.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.472
Can I just say that
your retirement speech was amazing.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.182
It's the first time
my father's forwarded me

21:05.265 --> 21:08.769
an e-mail in the last five years that
wasn't about the scourge of immigration.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.854
And that really meant a lot to me,
so thank you.

21:11.855 --> 21:13.065
Cheers.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.817
It must've been super weird
afterwards though, right?

21:15.901 --> 21:17.361
I'm gonna need two more of these, please.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.742
Here you go, gentlemen.

21:23.825 --> 21:24.826
-Thank you, Mae.
-Thanks, Mae.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.828
Shame what happened to Earl.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.665
Him and his owner, Nigel,
used to come in here all the time,

21:29.748 --> 21:32.167
till he started shitting and pissing
all over the place.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.086
Yeah.
Nah, that's pretty common with older dogs.

21:34.169 --> 21:35.629
No, I'm talking about Nigel.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.341
-To Earl.
-He was a good boy.

21:44.888 --> 21:48.141
Hey, Coach, can I get real a second?
Forget my meal a second?

21:48.225 --> 21:50.394
Put down your beer
and tell your buddy how you feel a second?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.896
-Yeah.
-Sure.

21:53.939 --> 21:58.277
Look, I'm all for whatever it takes
to help Dani get back to being a hundred.

21:58.861 --> 22:01.822
But this whole idea of bringing in
someone from the outside

22:01.905 --> 22:03.448
to help us get him there,

22:03.532 --> 22:05.158
I don't know, it just kinda
puts a little knot in my belly.

22:05.242 --> 22:06.243
I'm not sure why.

22:07.411 --> 22:09.830
Sounds like it might be
your favorite Gin Blossoms song.

22:09.913 --> 22:12.040
-"Follow You Down"?
-No, "Hey Jealousy."

22:12.124 --> 22:13.959
No, "Hey Jealousy" is their best song.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.128
My favorite song of theirs is
"Follow You Down."

22:16.211 --> 22:18.046
You don't know that story?

22:18.130 --> 22:19.423
Doesn't matter, but to your point,

22:19.506 --> 22:21.758
you know, I thought it might've been
that green-eyed monster too,

22:21.842 --> 22:24.011
but you know,
I think there's a part of me

22:24.094 --> 22:29.057
that just doesn't--
I don't know… trust therapists?

22:29.725 --> 22:30.726
And how come?

22:31.435 --> 22:34.062
Well, when Michelle and I did
couple's therapy,

22:34.146 --> 22:37.441
it was with this therapist she'd been
going to for a while, and…

22:38.650 --> 22:40.903
I just kinda felt like I was being
set up, you know.

22:41.737 --> 22:43.822
Like I was going in there
not to be listened to,

22:43.906 --> 22:47.326
but rather just to hear about
all the things I'd been doing wrong.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.579
And that's the only time
you've ever seen a therapist?

22:50.662 --> 22:52.206
Oh, yeah.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.209
Do you remember what you said when
I got dumped by that cruise ship dancer

22:55.292 --> 22:57.127
and swore I would never date
another dancer again?

22:57.211 --> 22:58.545
"Can I have your tap shoes?"

22:59.129 --> 23:01.173
"All people are different people."

23:02.549 --> 23:03.550
I said that?

23:06.512 --> 23:07.513
That's pretty good.

23:07.596 --> 23:08.597
Yeah.

23:09.264 --> 23:11.308
-You went out with another dancer though?
-Many.

23:13.352 --> 23:14.353
Too many.

23:16.522 --> 23:18.524
Sorry if I was prattling on too much
this evening.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.109
You were as charming as ever.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.779
You sure you don't wanna
come back to mine?

23:24.363 --> 23:25.572
Got an early morning, remember?

23:27.199 --> 23:30.244
Right. Yeah, well,
let me know if I passed the test.

23:31.286 --> 23:33.539
-Lunch later this week?
-Perfect.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.544
Night.

23:38.627 --> 23:39.878
Thank you.

23:39.962 --> 23:41.338
-See ya.
-Bye.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.631
Cheers.

23:48.345 --> 23:50.639
-Well?
-I think he's a really good match.

23:50.722 --> 23:54.101
I mean, he's age-appropriate,
financially appropriate.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.227
He's not shy.

23:55.310 --> 23:57.896
-I love that about him.
-Totally.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.481
Fucking hell.

24:02.067 --> 24:03.360
Is there a problem?

24:04.444 --> 24:05.946
Tell the truth.

24:06.029 --> 24:08.073
He's fine. That's it.

24:08.156 --> 24:10.158
Nothing wrong with that,
most people are fine.

24:10.242 --> 24:13.412
But it's not about him. It's about
why the fuck you think he deserves you.

24:14.538 --> 24:17.958
You deserve someone who makes you
feel like you've been struck by lightning.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.044
Don't you dare settle for fine.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.926
Not that it's any of my business.

24:45.903 --> 24:50.782
435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440--

24:50.866 --> 24:52.284
Higgins, look alive!

24:53.118 --> 24:54.620
Nuts.

24:54.703 --> 24:58.081
Sorry. I just wanted to introduce you
to Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.

24:58.165 --> 25:00.042
She's gonna be looking after Dani.

25:00.125 --> 25:03.003
This is Nathan, Coach Beard,
and Ted Lasso.

25:03.086 --> 25:04.505
Oh, you don't need to stand.

25:04.588 --> 25:06.465
But it makes it a lot easier to do this.

25:07.716 --> 25:09.468
It's nice to meet you

25:09.551 --> 25:11.220
It's nice to meet you

25:11.303 --> 25:14.181
Consider this song
Our way to greet you

25:14.264 --> 25:15.265
Hey!

25:17.684 --> 25:20.395
So I understand that Dani has developed
a case of the yips?

25:20.479 --> 25:21.939
Hey!

25:22.648 --> 25:25.067
Okay, that's two weird things in a row.
What's going on?

25:25.150 --> 25:27.569
Well, Doc, we don't like
using that word around here.

25:27.653 --> 25:28.654
Why?

25:30.197 --> 25:31.365
How do I…

25:31.990 --> 25:32.991
Why y'all looking at me?

25:33.075 --> 25:35.744
He's the one that knows everyth--
Oh, okay, all right. Well, Doc--

25:35.827 --> 25:37.120
Doctor.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.206
Right, yes, of course. Sorry.

25:39.289 --> 25:42.709
Doctor. It's a superstition.

25:43.544 --> 25:45.087
I see. Well, the yips…

25:47.673 --> 25:49.091
are not a superstition.

25:49.675 --> 25:50.843
They are a mental condition,

25:50.926 --> 25:53.762
one that can be fixed
with discipline, not denial.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.640
So, then, you're pretty confident
that you can help us out with Dani?

25:56.723 --> 25:58.058
Are you good at your job?

25:59.518 --> 26:00.394
I mean…

26:01.436 --> 26:02.521
Don't worry about them.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.441
Put all bullshit humility aside
and be honest with me.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.360
Are you good at your job? Yes or no?

26:09.653 --> 26:10.654
Yes.

26:10.737 --> 26:11.947
I believe you.

26:12.865 --> 26:16.076
Well, as good as you are at your job,
I'm twice as good at mine.

26:20.789 --> 26:22.541
-We're very lucky to have you.
-Thank you very much.

26:22.624 --> 26:24.209
-That's good to know.
-Thank you for coming here.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.004
Right, so where should I be conducting
my sessions?

26:28.630 --> 26:31.425
Why don't I set you up
in my office, all right?

26:32.009 --> 26:35.470
Great. Nice meeting all of you
and sorry to have interrupted your game.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.555
What's your record?

26:36.638 --> 26:39.016
Oh, 1,236.

26:42.519 --> 26:43.770
Impressive.

26:52.404 --> 26:54.573
She seems fun.

26:59.578 --> 27:01.413
You're sure you're okay,
me using your office?

27:01.496 --> 27:02.706
Not just being polite?

27:02.789 --> 27:05.876
I-- It's probably a bit of both,
but I insist.

27:05.959 --> 27:08.170
-Thank you, Mr. Higgins.
-No problem.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.927
Hey, Doc… tor.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.595
This right here, this is Dani Rojas.

27:16.678 --> 27:19.223
Dani, this is Dr. Sharon Fieldstone.

27:19.306 --> 27:21.266
Nice to meet you, Dani. How you feeling?

27:21.350 --> 27:22.768
Like a murderer.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.770
Please.

27:26.021 --> 27:27.022
You're all right.

27:28.315 --> 27:31.693
Yeah. Want me to stick around,
help you break the ice with Dani here?

27:31.777 --> 27:33.987
I think we'll be all right, Coach Lasso.
Thank you.

27:34.905 --> 27:36.532
Okay. Yeah.

27:45.374 --> 27:46.875
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah.

27:47.417 --> 27:49.419
This is gonna be perfect. Yeah.

27:52.673 --> 27:55.050
And remember, this is when tickets
to Stomp were tough to get.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.511
Anyway, this tall redhead pushes
in front of me,

27:57.594 --> 27:59.429
so I tap him on the shoulder,
he turns around and goes,

27:59.513 --> 28:01.598
"Is there a problem?"
I go, "Yeah, there's a problem."

28:01.682 --> 28:03.851
He goes, "It's all right. It's all right.
I know the choreographer."

28:03.934 --> 28:04.935
Guess who it was…

28:26.331 --> 28:27.499
Is everything okay, Rebecca?

28:31.670 --> 28:34.882
It's j--
Dating is so odd, isn't it?

28:34.965 --> 28:37.843
-Yeah.
-I mean, we are all strangers essentially.

28:37.926 --> 28:41.722
So I mean, how is it ever possible
to truly feel safe with someone?

28:41.805 --> 28:42.806
I suppose you can't.

28:42.890 --> 28:45.267
You know, my friend, Flo, once told me

28:45.350 --> 28:49.730
that intimacy was all about
leaving yourself open to being attacked.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.274
-Oh.
-Isn't that horrible?

28:52.357 --> 28:53.692
I've not heard that one.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.737
But I mean, it does make you realize
how scary it is,

28:57.946 --> 28:59.656
allowing yourself to be intimate again.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.743
I mean, you really do have to be brave.

29:07.080 --> 29:08.665
And that's it right there, isn't it?

29:10.626 --> 29:12.836
I need to be brave enough to let someone…

29:14.755 --> 29:16.924
wonderful love me,

29:17.007 --> 29:20.093
without fear of being hurt
and without fear of being…

29:22.054 --> 29:23.055
safe.

29:26.433 --> 29:28.810
Sorry… Are you breaking up with me?

29:33.148 --> 29:36.735
I'm so sorry.
I-- I actually didn't know I was

29:36.818 --> 29:39.029
-going to do that--
-No, no, it's-- it's all right.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.495
Coffees are on me.

29:47.079 --> 29:49.790
Yeah, fair enough. Cheers.

29:59.633 --> 30:03.011
Dani Rojas, Rojas. Dani Rojas.

30:03.095 --> 30:05.138
Hello, my beautiful coaches.
May I join the drill?

30:05.222 --> 30:06.431
Sure thing, Dani, yeah.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.350
But hey, you take this
at your own pace, okay?

30:08.433 --> 30:09.434
You got it, Coach.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.322
Did she not wave back?

30:22.406 --> 30:24.658
-Oh, I don't think she saw me.
-She saw you.

31:10.204 --> 31:11.413
Hey, all right!

31:18.420 --> 31:20.672
Hey, they got a whole bunch
of new emojis on here. You see this?

31:20.756 --> 31:22.925
Do you remember when they added
Groucho but no Harpo?

31:23.008 --> 31:24.426
It's bullshit.

31:25.093 --> 31:29.306
Good night, coaches, and thank you
for Dr. Sharon. She's incredible.

31:29.389 --> 31:31.558
No problem, Dani.
Just glad you're feeling better.

31:32.726 --> 31:35.437
Yeah, but hold on a sec.
I'm just curious.

31:35.521 --> 31:38.232
What did she-- I mean,
what ended up helping you?

31:39.608 --> 31:40.984
Dr. Sharon helped me remember that

31:41.068 --> 31:44.446
even though football is life,
football is also death.

31:45.989 --> 31:47.824
And that football is football too.

31:49.326 --> 31:50.869
But mostly that football is life!

31:51.703 --> 31:52.704
Yeah.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.084
Yeah, well, there you have it.

31:58.377 --> 32:01.255
You know what, I'm gonna go upstairs,
thank the good doc before she splits.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.423
It's the least you can do.

32:04.049 --> 32:05.342
Hey, Higgins. Doc still here?

32:05.425 --> 32:07.219
Oh, wait, Ted. She's in a session.

32:07.302 --> 32:08.470
A session? With who?

32:10.055 --> 32:12.891
-Thank you, Sharon. For real.
-You're welcome.

32:13.642 --> 32:14.643
She's amazing.

32:15.644 --> 32:18.397
-Thierry?
-Oh, yes. Hi.

32:24.444 --> 32:27.447
A few of the boys asked to sit down
with Dr. Fieldstone before she left.

32:27.531 --> 32:28.615
I don't see the harm, right?

32:29.199 --> 32:31.118
No, that-- That's great. Yeah.

32:35.998 --> 32:38.959
-Hi.
-Hey, gorgeous. What's going on?

32:39.042 --> 32:40.294
I feel like a little shit.

32:40.794 --> 32:43.422
I used our fun night out together
to try and change your mind

32:43.505 --> 32:45.382
about something you don't wanna do.

32:45.465 --> 32:47.634
That was tacky,
and I'm really sorry for it.

32:47.718 --> 32:49.678
You're very sweet. Thank you.

32:49.761 --> 32:51.263
I'm leaving work right now.

32:51.346 --> 32:54.224
I can stop by Waitrose,
pick up a bottle of wine, bring it over?

32:54.308 --> 32:57.269
Waitrose, is it?
Who am I talking to, the fucking queen?

32:57.978 --> 32:59.438
I'd love to, but…

32:59.521 --> 33:01.315
Oh, fuck! Yeah, it's yoga mums night.
Sorry.

33:01.398 --> 33:04.109
Yeah, but you can
beg for forgiveness later.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.611
I can swing by and wake you up.

33:05.694 --> 33:08.488
Roy. Hurry up. It's about to start.

33:09.323 --> 33:11.408
I'll be awake. Have fun, yeah?

33:11.491 --> 33:12.492
Bye, babe.

33:14.703 --> 33:16.038
Let's fucking do this.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.667
Who will be eliminated this week

33:20.751 --> 33:24.463
on the UK's number one show,
Lust Conquers All?

33:24.546 --> 33:27.966
Will it be Grimsby's
top makeup counter associate, Ellie?

33:28.050 --> 33:31.470
Can't vote me off, yeah?
I'm the one who makes your lips tick.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.388
Oh, shut up, you slag.

33:33.472 --> 33:35.265
Come on. She's hilarious.

33:35.349 --> 33:38.185
Or will it be the footballing tart, Jamie?

33:42.231 --> 33:44.691
You can't get rid of me.
I'm the island's top scorer.

33:45.859 --> 33:46.860
Sexually.

33:49.238 --> 33:50.989
God, I love him.

33:51.073 --> 33:52.199
Oh, same.

33:53.075 --> 33:55.410
-Jesus.
-Top up my rosé please, Janice?

33:55.494 --> 33:57.162
…pharmacist from Borehamwood?

33:57.246 --> 33:59.873
-Or Clara, Bournemouth's scandalous…
-Cheers.

33:59.957 --> 34:00.958
Cheers.
