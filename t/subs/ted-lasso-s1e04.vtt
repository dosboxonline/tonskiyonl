00:06.507 --> 00:10.177
You're hearing AFC Richmond
being booed lustily by their home fans,

00:10.260 --> 00:13.472
and you have to say,
not without good reason.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.807
2-0. We're better than that!

00:16.683 --> 00:20.187
Jamie. Jamie. Sorry, I didn't put
that cross where you wanted it.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.105
Forget it, mate.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.691
Hey, would it be too forward
if I gave you some advice

00:24.775 --> 00:26.735
that might help improve your game a bit?

00:26.818 --> 00:27.819
No. Please, anything.

00:27.903 --> 00:31.281
What you need to do is get yourself
a time machine, and go back to the moment

00:31.365 --> 00:34.493
when your mom was about to fuck
a sad little man with no athletic talent.

00:34.576 --> 00:39.248
Pull her off him, fly her to Argentina,
and drop her onto Maradona's cock.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.334
Hope that helps, mate.

00:43.252 --> 00:44.503
Right, that's it.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.005
I'm done with you
being a prick to everyone.

00:48.423 --> 00:53.512
So, either I beat up an old man,
or I let an old man beat me up.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.558
Fuck it. Let's go.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.268
Fucking--

01:00.185 --> 01:01.770
Hey, hey, hey!

01:03.647 --> 01:05.274
Easy, easy, easy now!

01:05.357 --> 01:07.359
Coach, tell these boys
what the first rule of my fight club is.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.320
-No fight club!
-No fight club. Okay? You understand?

01:11.029 --> 01:14.199
For the love of Pistol Pete, y'all.
We still got a second half to play.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.118
Now, please, sit down. Everybody.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.080
Gaffer saved you, old man.

01:24.209 --> 01:25.586
Call me old...

01:26.879 --> 01:27.880
one more time.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.051
Sorry...

01:34.678 --> 01:35.888
granddad.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.681
I'll fucking kill you!

02:00.871 --> 02:06.335
Table four is done and shall from now on
be known as the boring table.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.419
But that's where I'm sitting.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.759
I haven't placed Elaine Kenner.
Awful woman.

02:13.842 --> 02:17.262
She won't be attending tonight.
She was kicked in the face by her horse.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.431
That poor thing. Is the horse okay?

02:23.352 --> 02:25.854
Looks like we still got ourselves
a team divided here.

02:26.522 --> 02:28.273
Coach, you know what
I'm thinkin' about right now?

02:28.357 --> 02:30.734
-West Side Story?
-You know it. Sharks and Jets.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.818
You think these fellas

02:31.902 --> 02:34.696
could solve their problems
with a dance-off at a gymnasium?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.406
Course, if memory serves,

02:36.490 --> 02:40.035
Riff and Bernardo ended up getting
knifed to death at that particular event.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.329
No, they didn't die
until the rumble afterwards.

02:42.412 --> 02:43.497
Right. Right, right, right.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.582
When I was 15, I was understudy for Anita.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.876
All-boys school.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.713
We have peeled yet another
juicy layer of the Nathan onion.

02:52.130 --> 02:53.674
Coach Beard!

02:54.466 --> 02:58.804
For dinner tonight,
it's either chicken or steak!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.347
You can't tick both!

03:00.848 --> 03:01.974
Okay!

03:02.057 --> 03:03.475
Busted.

03:03.559 --> 03:04.685
And Ted!

03:06.019 --> 03:09.314
-Yeah!
-I need to know who your plus-one is!

03:09.398 --> 03:12.192
Well, that'd be Mr. Two EntrÃ©es here.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.945
No, he's already bringing a date!

03:18.073 --> 03:19.324
Hey, you free tonight?

03:19.700 --> 03:21.910
-I'm free every night, yeah.
-Okay.

03:21.994 --> 03:24.121
-I'm gonna bring Nathan!
-Who?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.623
Nate the Great! He's gonna be my date!

03:26.707 --> 03:29.585
And for obvious reasons,
we'd love to be at table eight!

03:30.294 --> 03:31.295
No!

03:31.879 --> 03:33.463
And Beard, you're having chicken!

03:37.509 --> 03:38.510
Hey, boss.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.637
Pajama Friday? Wish I woulda known.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.639
You're gonna get a kick outta this story.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.933
-When I was 17--
-Ted, let me just stop you there

03:45.017 --> 03:47.394
before you tell me a folksy anecdote
about you and pajamas.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.313
Okay. When you change your mind,
just let me know,

03:49.396 --> 03:51.190
'cause this one is a doozy.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.859
Sorry, was there anything you needed?
'Cause I'm really--

03:53.942 --> 03:56.987
I was wondering if me, Roy and Jamie
could all sit at the same table tonight.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.071
-Is that possible?
-Yes.

03:58.155 --> 04:00.949
Great! 'Cause I got some fences I need to
mend, and I think that might do the trick.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.951
-Ted, I just said yes.
-Right.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.121
Oh, God,
that one's absolutely beautiful, but...

04:07.456 --> 04:09.374
I don't think I can get away
with that anymore.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.376
Sure you could.
Fashion's all about confidence.

04:11.460 --> 04:14.421
If I didn't have any confidence,
I never would've worn pajamas to my prom

04:14.505 --> 04:15.881
and ended up in jail
the rest of that night.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.841
But you don't wanna hear that story,
so I ain't gonna tell it.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.176
You know what? I'll get outta your hair.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.803
You're probably all revved up
because of the big shindig, right?

04:21.887 --> 04:23.305
No, no, no. I'm absolutely fine.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.141
I mean, even when Rupert and I
were running the gala together,

04:26.225 --> 04:28.060
I did most of the work myself.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.603
So, I'm not revved up at all.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.564
I'm actually, really,
feeling quite mellow.

04:32.648 --> 04:34.858
Good afternoon. We have a huge problem.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.819
Our musical guest, Robbie Williams,
has canceled.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.904
God!

04:38.987 --> 04:40.113
Oh, no. Who is that?

04:40.197 --> 04:44.952
No, no, no. That's absolutely fine.
It's not a problem. Let me just think.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.204
All right, here's what
we're going to do, Higgins.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.374
Tonight, when I tell everyone
that Robbie has canceled,

04:50.457 --> 04:54.086
by then it won't matter because
you will have found someone better.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.171
-There ya are.
-Right.

04:56.255 --> 05:00.092
I am a world-class problem solver.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.554
There it is. You got it.
Catch it! Yep! Look at that!

05:04.555 --> 05:06.139
You got this, Higgins!

05:06.223 --> 05:08.183
And Rebecca's grateful
for all your hard work!

05:08.267 --> 05:09.268
Thank you, Ted!

05:16.984 --> 05:18.485
No. I hate it, babe.

05:18.569 --> 05:21.780
It's just not me.
There's no hood, no zips.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.031
There's no graffiti.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.493
No graffiti.

05:27.077 --> 05:29.037
Mad. I look like a banker.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.582
Not with trousers that tight
around the crotch, you don't.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.293
Fine. I look like a banker
with a great cock.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.461
Babe, if those existed,
we wouldn't be together.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.423
Whatever.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.841
Okay.

05:40.924 --> 05:44.720
Look, you're gonna get more endorsements
when you start embracing high fashion.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.555
I'm just trying to help
build up your brand.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.391
Jamie, no. What are you doing?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.684
I'm doing...

05:51.852 --> 05:52.895
style.

05:53.770 --> 05:57.149
Yeah, people don't know it,
but I'm good at this fashion shit.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.610
-Are you?
-Yeah, I'm like a progeny.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.028
Oh, yeah?

06:01.820 --> 06:03.322
Oi. Down, boy.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.242
That's a good boy. Find the treat, yeah.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.163
Hey, hon.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.374
Shoot, I was hoping I'd catch ya.
Got your message.

06:14.458 --> 06:17.461
Playing a little phone tag, it appears.
And you are now it.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.713
Hey. Guess what.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.965
I'm wearing the suit
you told me I should bring.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.926
You were right, as always.

06:25.177 --> 06:29.515
Yeah. Okay, so, that's it.
I love-- I miss ya.

06:29.598 --> 06:32.142
And just go ahead
and give the little guy a squeeze for me.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.644
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.397
Hey. All right, now.

06:37.481 --> 06:39.149
Gotta love a troubadour.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.317
Here we go.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.946
Holy moly, look at you.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.489
-Hope I'm not too early.
-No.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.366
Or too late. I was trying to go
for somewhere in between.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.284
Yeah, no.
You threaded that needle perfectly, Nate.

06:49.368 --> 06:50.536
-Good.
-Yeah, nailed it.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.788
Hey, let me ask you something.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.207
Are you one of those guys
that likes it if your friends tell you

06:55.290 --> 06:58.210
-you got a piece of food in your teeth?
-Absolutely, yeah.

06:58.293 --> 07:01.046
Okay, good.
'Cause that suit does not fit at all.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.965
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.759
I was gonna buy one,
but, you know, they're so expensive.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.678
-I just thought I'd borrow my dad's.
-I hear ya.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.430
Hey. We'll make a little pit stop.
Come on, follow me.

07:10.514 --> 07:11.348
Yeah.

07:16.812 --> 07:18.063
What you lookin' at?

07:18.939 --> 07:22.442
You boys all right? How's my suit?
All good? Yeah?

07:22.526 --> 07:23.735
This is great.

07:23.819 --> 07:26.488
Hey, thank you, guys, so much
for taking my picture.

07:26.572 --> 07:27.573
What are your names?

07:28.907 --> 07:31.243
So you're Jerry, and you're Dave.

07:31.326 --> 07:33.203
What you all came for.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.706
Left eyebrow. Right eyebrow.

07:36.331 --> 07:37.541
Confused look.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.128
Yeah, now for the one
that you'll actually use.

07:41.211 --> 07:42.588
That's it, darling. How about a kiss?

07:47.843 --> 07:50.053
-Romance is not dead.
-Guys, sorry, sorry. I just--

07:50.137 --> 07:51.763
-Gonna let them take a picture.
-Yeah. Yeah.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.265
I just need to get inside. Okay.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.726
Rebecca, over here!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.853
-Nice, ladies.
-Rebecca, over here!

07:57.936 --> 07:59.771
-You look perfect.
-Now, look to your left.

07:59.855 --> 08:00.939
I hate this part.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.816
-Miss Welton.
-Lovely. Nice.

08:03.317 --> 08:04.318
Hey.

08:04.776 --> 08:06.737
Just put one foot
in front of the other, yeah?

08:06.820 --> 08:09.781
And then put your hand on your hip
and make, like, a claw shape.

08:10.324 --> 08:11.533
It's the most flattering.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.453
-Rebecca, give us a smile.
-Rebecca!

08:17.664 --> 08:20.292
Look at her. She's fucking fit!

08:34.222 --> 08:36.183
Don't strut. Let the suit do the work.

08:41.813 --> 08:44.024
Ted Lasso. My God.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.234
Right back at ya, boss.

08:45.317 --> 08:47.319
I had a hunch
you were gonna pick this dress.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.321
And may I say,
you are wearing the heck out of it.

08:49.821 --> 08:50.822
Thank you.

08:50.906 --> 08:53.283
Check out Nate.
Looking pretty dapper himself, huh?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.493
Great to see you again.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.370
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.998
-If you'll both excuse me.
-Absolutely, yeah. Go do your thing.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.502
Look, there's Beard over there.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.420
That's his new gal, Jane.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.340
Yeah, they met
at his Friday night chess club.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.425
Apparently, they liked each other's moves.

09:12.970 --> 09:13.971
That wasn't a joke.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.055
Was it not?

09:15.556 --> 09:16.557
I guess it kinda was.

09:17.432 --> 09:21.562
No. No. Fuck off. Fuck you. No. No.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.522
Yeah, I know.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.444
This is gonna be so uncomfortable.

09:29.528 --> 09:32.656
-I'm switching tables.
-No, no, no. Hey. Come on back here.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.782
This is my doing.

09:33.866 --> 09:36.076
I parent trapped y'all. Take a seat.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.832
Now, listen. You two knuckleheads
have split our locker room in half.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.458
And when it comes to locker rooms,

09:43.542 --> 09:45.544
I like 'em just like
my mother's bathing suits.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.421
I only wanna see 'em in one piece,
you hear?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.714
So we're fixing this.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.799
Tell me what's the biggest issue
you got with each other. Go.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.050
He's a piece of shit.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.803
If his brain was on fire,
I wouldn't piss in his ear.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.222
Well, hey. You don't need to be best
friends to be great teammates.

09:57.306 --> 10:00.392
Think about Shaq and Kobe, right?
Lennon and McCartney.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.686
Heck, even Woody and Buzz
got under each other's plastic.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.937
Wasn't Woody made out of cloth?

10:04.021 --> 10:06.106
I appreciate you, Nate,
but now's not the time.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.984
You know what all those dynamic duos
had in common?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.152
Mutual respect.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.864
Y'all gotta find some common ground.
So who wants to get the ball rollin'?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.199
I do.

10:16.074 --> 10:20.204
Nate, that's a very nice suit.
I think you look chic.

10:20.287 --> 10:24.458
Thank you. It's actually only
the second suit I've ever owned.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.586
The first one was my suit
when I was a naked baby.

10:31.215 --> 10:33.133
Sorry, it's funny when Ted says it. I--

10:33.217 --> 10:34.551
Well, the term "birthday suit"

10:34.635 --> 10:36.678
-woulda helped you a ton there, yeah.
-Oh, God, yeah.

10:36.762 --> 10:39.348
Come on, let's try this again, all right?
Hey, Jamie. You wanna go?

10:39.431 --> 10:40.682
Pass.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.393
-Roy.
-He's a piece of shit.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.521
You're gonna stick with that, huh? Okay.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.981
Here's an idea that's
gonna help a little or hurt a whole lot.

10:48.065 --> 10:49.191
Who needs a drink?

10:54.655 --> 10:56.156
Any progress with the musical guest?

10:56.240 --> 10:57.783
I've talked to a number of agents

10:57.866 --> 11:01.828
and made a fairly extensive list
of those who cannot make it.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.747
Process of elimination. We're on our way.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.168
Hey, there she is.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.046
You're working on your speech, huh?

11:11.755 --> 11:15.384
Rupert was always very good
at the public speaking part.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.885
Hey, here's a little trick of the trade.

11:16.969 --> 11:20.430
Just make fun of yourself
right off the bat, a little joke.

11:20.514 --> 11:21.515
Folks will love that.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.393
Okay, so,
what should I make fun of myself about?

11:26.061 --> 11:27.521
Right, right, right.

11:30.732 --> 11:35.153
You know-- You know what would be--
No. Okay.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.239
You're not gonna walk
into that one, are you, Ted?

11:37.322 --> 11:39.491
No, ma'am. Nope, nope, nope. Okay.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.160
Good luck though.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.665
You know what?
I thought of something. No, no, no.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.209
Queen to rook four.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.337
Wait, are y'all playing a game
without a board?

11:53.547 --> 11:56.008
Sorry to interrupt. My fault.
Sorry. Carry on.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.052
Knight to king five.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.767
Good evening,

12:05.851 --> 12:10.647
and welcome to the Tenth Annual Benefit
for Underprivileged Children.

12:11.064 --> 12:15.611
If I could hug each of you as a thank you
for your kind donations, well...

12:16.528 --> 12:19.573
I probably wouldn't because,
as we all know, I'm not much of a hugger.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.829
Now, I do hope you've all brought your
checkbooks with you for our auction later.

12:25.913 --> 12:31.835
Because you can all bid
on our very own Richmond players.

12:34.296 --> 12:39.801
Same rule as always, no hanky-panky
unless the player signs a waiver.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.471
Rupert?

12:43.847 --> 12:44.890
Hello, darling.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.809
What a... lovely surprise.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.895
Weren't you expecting me?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.148
Only 'cause you RSVP'd no.

12:53.232 --> 12:56.485
Well, one of the perks
of being a wealthy good-for-nothing.

12:56.568 --> 12:59.780
Sometimes my nights
just magically free up.

13:01.240 --> 13:02.824
May I? Thank you.

13:03.575 --> 13:09.373
Gals and gents, with your help,
we raised Â£800,000 last year.

13:11.542 --> 13:14.294
And this year, hopefully even more.

13:14.378 --> 13:18.507
Well, I know I'm crashing your party,
but I so badly wanna help.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.301
My fingers and toes are crossed
that you will have me.

13:21.385 --> 13:22.386
Of course.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.888
Let's get him a seat at the boring table.

13:25.556 --> 13:26.807
Only joking.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.601
Table four. Rupert Mannion, everyone.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.151
Thanks, doll.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.534
Oh, my God.

13:46.535 --> 13:47.870
-Thank you.
-That--

13:49.538 --> 13:51.415
Nathe, Nathe, Nathe. Come on.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.458
Look, guys, this is a brand-new suit.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.211
Rather than messing with me tonight,
can you just get me two times tomorrow?

13:56.295 --> 13:57.838
Roy said we're not allowed anymore.

13:57.921 --> 14:00.757
He fucking headbutted me.
I'm still dizzy half the time.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.467
The doctors told me not to drink.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.682
Shit.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.475
Yet another reason shirts exist.

14:10.559 --> 14:13.478
Shut up, it's not funny. Burned my nipple.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.273
I wish I was that ice cube.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.152
I will be bidding for a night with you.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.362
Thanks, love.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.991
Yeah, it's just a date though.
It's not a whole night. So...

14:26.074 --> 14:27.326
We'll see.

14:28.577 --> 14:29.745
Mate, I've done these before.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.623
If she bids over 3,000,
you will have to fuck her.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.543
-Is that true?
-You don't have to go all the way.

14:37.336 --> 14:38.879
Just, like, some of the way.

14:39.630 --> 14:40.797
Fingering.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.720
Fuck you. Fuck this table.

14:47.346 --> 14:49.056
Jamie, it was a joke.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.767
It was a joke. Jamie.

14:53.477 --> 14:54.603
What happened now?

14:55.771 --> 14:59.107
Just the usual.
Jamie being a little bitch prima donna.

15:00.901 --> 15:02.444
Roy, let me ask you something.

15:02.528 --> 15:04.154
What were you like when you were 23?

15:04.696 --> 15:06.657
Playing in this league,
making all that money.

15:08.033 --> 15:10.285
-Little bitch prima donna.
-Yeah.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.830
You know how they say that
"youth is wasted on the young"?

15:15.582 --> 15:18.669
Well, I say don't let the wisdom
of age be wasted on you.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.129
Ted?

15:23.465 --> 15:26.218
I just came up with that.
I feel pretty good about it.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.060
I just wanted to say thanks
for talking to Colin and Isaac.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.770
Why is your face so close to mine?

15:36.854 --> 15:39.940
Well, my initial plan was to hug you,
but I just chickened out just now.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.775
Right.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.531
-Okay, we're done.
-Yeah.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.911
Ted, I'd like to introduce you
to Rupert Mannion.

15:52.995 --> 15:55.539
-Mr. Mannion, how are you?
-It's Rupert, Ted.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.250
Especially for the man
who's managing my club.

15:59.293 --> 16:00.502
Used to be your club.

16:00.586 --> 16:04.089
Of course, of course, but...
it's still my club in here, love.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.800
Love of a sports team
is a lifetime obsession.

16:06.884 --> 16:07.718
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.553
Kinda like your best friend's
older sister, right?

16:09.928 --> 16:10.929
Hey, but do me a favor.

16:11.013 --> 16:13.724
If you're ever in Kansas City
and come across a fella named Tom Dineen,

16:13.807 --> 16:15.017
don't tell him I said that.

16:17.019 --> 16:18.770
I love that.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.065
I don't love our last two losses though.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.400
-Horrible showing.
-Yeah.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.776
Had to say it, wish I didn't.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.696
It's okay. Who knows?
Maybe we'll turn it around, huh?

16:28.405 --> 16:31.116
Oh, my God. I believe you.

16:31.200 --> 16:32.284
Do you believe him?

16:35.662 --> 16:37.998
Night's gonna take
a turn for the worse if you say no.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.250
Of course I believe in Ted.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.961
He's exactly what we've needed.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.381
Not too much champagne now, dear.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.509
Gotta stay sharp for the auction.

16:49.635 --> 16:50.802
Why don't you do the auction?

16:51.512 --> 16:53.305
No, I couldn't. This is your night.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.557
We both know they'd rather see you.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.144
And besides, it's... for the children.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.063
For the children.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.609
Right. If you'll excuse me,
I need to speak to the other guests.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.694
I must say, I love that dress.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.323
It's very youthful.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.660
Good for you for getting back out there
looking like that.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.744
Thank you.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.123
Excuse me.

17:20.874 --> 17:21.916
Ted.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.545
It's been a hard year for her.
Is she okay?

17:24.627 --> 17:25.587
Yeah, she's great.

17:26.255 --> 17:29.591
You know, a lot of moving pieces putting
together a thing like this though.

17:30.342 --> 17:34.012
And then she had this fella...
Robbie Williams cancel on her and--

17:34.096 --> 17:35.097
-Robbie?
-Yeah.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.932
Well, he's an old pal of mine.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.852
I'm happy to text him.
I bet you I can get his ass over here.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.854
I bet she'd love it.

17:42.437 --> 17:45.232
I'll go track her down
and run it up the flagpole, huh?

17:45.983 --> 17:47.818
I'm sorry.
That's an expression from back home.

17:47.901 --> 17:50.863
-Just means I'm gonna ask her.
-Fabulous. Showtime.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.155
All right, go get 'em.

17:52.781 --> 17:55.534
Can I get something stronger,
like a Jack on the rocks or something?

17:55.617 --> 17:58.370
A double and a single in one. A triple.

17:59.872 --> 18:03.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
slight change in plans.

18:03.083 --> 18:07.171
I have been cajoled into being
your auctioneer for this evening.

18:09.464 --> 18:13.427
And our first victim is Jamie Tartt.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.390
Babe, you have to win me.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.517
I can't bid on my own boyfriend.
I'll look pathetic.

18:20.601 --> 18:22.519
Babe, it's 2020. Women can do anything.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.105
No, it's not happening.
Come on, you look hot. Go up there!

18:25.189 --> 18:29.693
Look at him, folks.
Young, gorgeous, charming. The bastard.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.654
So, we'll start with Â£5,000.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.323
I want him, Rupert.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.618
Five thousand from Cheryl Barnaby.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.329
Richmond's premier breeder
of Shetland ponies.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.164
Do we hear six?

18:44.082 --> 18:45.209
Six thousand.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.752
Six. Thank you.

18:46.835 --> 18:49.838
-Seven thousand.
-Seven thousand.

18:49.922 --> 18:51.256
Ten thousand.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.551
Stunning.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.679
And that applies
to the bid and the bidder.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.015
I don't think so.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.018
-Twelve thousand pounds.
-Fourteen thousand.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.603
Fourteen thousand!

19:04.686 --> 19:05.812
Sixteen thousand.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.022
Eighteen.

19:07.481 --> 19:10.317
Eighteen thousand. Do I hear any advance?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.277
Yeah. Twenty-five thousand.

19:12.361 --> 19:17.366
Twenty-five thousand! Going once. Twice.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.201
Sold to Keeley Jones.

19:19.284 --> 19:24.206
Why spend the time with your boyfriend for
free when you can have him for 25 grand?

19:24.706 --> 19:25.707
You owe me.

19:29.711 --> 19:33.173
Hey. There you are.
Getting a little fresh air, huh?

19:33.257 --> 19:37.511
Yeah. Those rickshaw bike things
are so silly, but they do look like fun.

19:37.594 --> 19:38.428
Yeah.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.222
-You ever been on one?
-No, ma'am.

19:40.305 --> 19:44.810
My wife and I once rented one of those
tandem bikes on vacation a while back.

19:44.893 --> 19:48.188
Not the best experience.
She broke her arm and I actually...

19:48.272 --> 19:51.775
Well, I chipped a tooth,
and I bruised my perineum.

19:54.194 --> 19:56.446
-Hey, you okay?
-It's just...

19:57.906 --> 19:59.116
That man, he knows me.

20:00.367 --> 20:04.204
I used to think his blunt honesty
was noble rather than what it really is.

20:04.288 --> 20:05.289
Which is just...

20:07.583 --> 20:10.294
the cruelest way
of hiding his own insecurities.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.922
He'd say wear this, eat that.

20:16.758 --> 20:18.302
And I listened.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.888
But now I'm alone.

20:22.556 --> 20:25.934
I'm alone, Ted.
Just like he said I would be if I left.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.690
I don't want to be alone.

20:36.528 --> 20:39.323
Hey. It's okay. Okay.

20:52.836 --> 20:56.715
You wanna hop on this thing
and get the heck outta Dodge? Come on.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.925
I wish.

20:59.218 --> 21:00.844
Not right now. Thank you though.

21:04.973 --> 21:07.184
Has he started the auction?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.644
Yeah, yeah.

21:08.727 --> 21:11.647
Good. I'm glad he's done that.
We'll get much more money.

21:12.940 --> 21:15.067
No matter what he does,
they just love him.

21:18.278 --> 21:21.031
-You wanna head back in?
-No, you go ahead.

21:21.698 --> 21:22.699
I need to freshen up.

21:22.783 --> 21:26.745
I probably look like Robert Smith
after he's woken up from a nap.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.123
Very emotional man. Yeah.

21:30.207 --> 21:31.375
Okay, I'll see you inside.

21:43.303 --> 21:44.304
When I was coming up,

21:44.388 --> 21:46.807
there was this old geezer at the club,
Doug Stashwick.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.976
He was always on me. Hated each other.

21:49.601 --> 21:51.728
-You wanna know how we won the league?
-No.

21:52.396 --> 21:54.731
It was the same shit
Yankee Doodle was peddling.

21:54.815 --> 21:57.109
He sat me down and he said,
"Let's get it all out there.

21:57.192 --> 22:00.070
You tell me why I'm a prick,
and I'll tell you why you are."

22:02.406 --> 22:04.324
-You're a nasty bastard--
-No, I'm going first.

22:05.742 --> 22:08.871
Even though I know I should pass to you...

22:10.038 --> 22:11.874
you're so selfish and arrogant.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.084
Every time I do,
it makes me want to fucking puke.

22:16.587 --> 22:20.257
You know, I had a poster of you
on my wall when I was a kid.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.594
Used to love watching you play.

22:25.721 --> 22:28.348
But you're not the player
that you used to be,

22:28.432 --> 22:30.684
and just because you won a few trophies,

22:30.767 --> 22:33.854
you walk around here
expecting everyone to kiss your ring.

22:36.815 --> 22:39.193
Yeah, I can be like that.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.618
Now's the bit
where you admit to what I said.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.369
I don't wanna.

22:51.997 --> 22:53.207
Even if it is just...

22:54.666 --> 22:55.751
a little bit true.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.300
You and that Doug bloke,
you ever become friends?

23:03.383 --> 23:05.427
Fuck no. I hope he's dead.

23:07.638 --> 23:08.764
To you dying.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.434
Such a prick.

23:15.646 --> 23:16.897
Howdy, partner.

23:18.607 --> 23:21.777
So, you ask Rebecca
what she thought about texting Robbie?

23:22.361 --> 23:25.781
You know what? I couldn't find her.
I say don't worry about it.

23:25.864 --> 23:28.450
If you change your mind,
say the word and-- sent.

23:28.534 --> 23:30.869
He'll be right over. Top up.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.705
Hey, Rupert,
something just occurred to me.

23:33.789 --> 23:37.251
If you could've texted Robbie Williams
asking him to come tonight...

23:38.794 --> 23:42.172
you could've probably just as easily
asked him not to come.

23:44.508 --> 23:47.427
Well, now, that would've made me
a real piece of shit, wouldn't it?

23:53.767 --> 23:57.688
Hey, Ted. Do you think Rebecca knows
what the real Adele looks like?

23:58.897 --> 24:01.149
I need to go on a little adventure,
and I need a copilot.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.861
-And you want me?
-Yeah. Forget the rest, I need the best.

24:03.944 --> 24:05.153
Come on, follow me.

24:10.826 --> 24:13.120
-Thank you, by the way.
-Huh?

24:13.537 --> 24:17.624
The red carpet photos are already online,

24:17.708 --> 24:21.336
and I actually look all right for once.

24:21.420 --> 24:22.921
Glad to help.

24:26.592 --> 24:27.634
Keeley?

24:27.718 --> 24:28.719
I think you should know

24:28.802 --> 24:32.639
that the young woman that was bidding
on Jamie was actually his other plus-one.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.435
Cheeky little prick.

24:39.897 --> 24:42.399
-Can I have a sip of your drink?
-Yes.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.609
Thanks.

24:44.693 --> 24:46.528
In anything else, I hate olives.

24:46.612 --> 24:50.824
I think the little, like,
orange clitoris thing is really freaky.

24:53.911 --> 24:55.287
Have you ever dated a footballer?

24:56.371 --> 24:58.373
-What?
-Sorry.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.252
I shouldn't laugh. It sounds... judgy.

25:02.336 --> 25:04.463
No, it's okay. You are a bit judgy.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.549
So when I was 18,
I dated a footballer that was 23.

25:09.301 --> 25:13.013
Now I'm close to 30, and I am
still dating a 23-year-old footballer.

25:14.306 --> 25:15.974
I'm Leonardo DiCaprio.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.019
They are pretty fun though.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.523
Simple, rich, fit.

25:22.606 --> 25:24.316
What about accountable?

25:25.025 --> 25:26.026
What do you mean?

25:26.610 --> 25:29.780
Well, I mean,
everyone makes mistakes, but...

25:31.657 --> 25:34.284
I was married to a man for 12 years

25:34.993 --> 25:38.539
who never once took responsibility
for any single one of them.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.174
Hi.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.259
-Hi.
-I'm Keeley.

25:50.342 --> 25:51.343
Hi, I'm Bex.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.220
-Really nice to meet you, Bex.
-Nice to meet you.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.389
Do you mind if I just have a minute
on my own with this one?

25:55.472 --> 25:58.225
Yeah, sure. Lovely to meet you.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.061
She your new girlfriend?

26:01.144 --> 26:04.773
Relax, babe.
It's all part of the branding plan, innit?

26:04.857 --> 26:07.776
If I've got two women bidding on me,
it makes me look more valuable.

26:07.860 --> 26:08.944
Do you know what I mean?

26:09.778 --> 26:10.988
It's fucking smart, eh?

26:11.697 --> 26:17.452
And now, the only former Champions League
winner on the menu, say hello to Roy Kent.

26:17.536 --> 26:18.579
Granddad.

26:21.081 --> 26:26.336
And the highest bidder gets to spend
a day at a swanky hotel by the pool

26:26.420 --> 26:29.965
drinking frozen daiquiris
and soaking up the rays--

26:30.048 --> 26:32.259
No, we said
there's no daiquiris and no rays.

26:34.094 --> 26:37.306
There's not gonna be a fucking pool
either. We're not leaving SW14.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.058
You looked so jealous. It was so cool.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.019
You think jealousy is cool, do you?

26:42.102 --> 26:43.604
Don't know, babe. I don't get jealous.

26:43.687 --> 26:47.065
Well, can we have 100 quid for what's
turning out to be a very boring date?

26:47.524 --> 26:48.859
All right. A thousand pounds.

26:50.319 --> 26:53.739
-Any advances on that?
-Two thousand pounds!

26:54.865 --> 26:57.075
Cheryl's got fire inside her.

26:57.159 --> 27:00.078
-Three thousand pounds.
-Babe, you're just embarrassing yourself.

27:00.704 --> 27:02.623
Four thousand pounds!

27:02.706 --> 27:03.790
Five thousand!

27:04.541 --> 27:06.835
Six thousand pounds.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.879
-Any advance on six?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:10.088 --> 27:12.049
Okay, sold to Cheryl.

27:19.723 --> 27:24.728
That concludes the auction,
apart from one small surprise.

27:25.604 --> 27:31.527
I am personally donating
Â£1 million to the cause.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.155
Thank you.

27:35.656 --> 27:37.449
Thank you very much. Thank you.

27:37.533 --> 27:43.705
And that, I believe, gets Rebecca
over her goal of 800,000. Thank you.

27:47.459 --> 27:48.794
For the children, eh?

28:00.556 --> 28:01.640
Rebecca.

28:01.723 --> 28:05.644
This here is Cam Cole.
He's an undiscovered mega-talent.

28:05.727 --> 28:07.187
Go on, Cam. Show 'em what you got.

28:11.441 --> 28:12.442
Are you insane?

28:12.526 --> 28:16.488
Hey, Rebecca. You do not wanna judge
this book by its cover right here, okay?

28:17.865 --> 28:18.866
The hell with it.

28:20.617 --> 28:21.618
Yes.

28:22.911 --> 28:27.916
Hello again. Ladies and gentlemen,
I regret to inform you that...

28:29.209 --> 28:33.297
Robbie Williams is unable to be here
tonight due to an emergency.

28:33.380 --> 28:38.218
But we have a brilliant replacement
for you who you are just going to love.

28:38.302 --> 28:41.180
Or, at least, have lots to talk about
on the way home.

28:41.972 --> 28:47.603
All the way from outside...
please welcome Cam something.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.111
Bollocks.

28:57.696 --> 28:58.697
What does that mean?

29:12.961 --> 29:18.592
Mama, sweet mama nature
Please forgive us and what we've done

29:21.553 --> 29:23.889
Can we just forget about the game
and go and have a dance?

29:24.598 --> 29:26.683
Queen to king five. Checkmate.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.777
We've gone and hurt our mama

29:36.860 --> 29:40.072
And her wrath has begun

30:02.970 --> 30:06.014
'Cause I'm a good boy to my mama

30:09.101 --> 30:13.814
But

30:13.897 --> 30:19.027
I've got bad siblings

30:27.536 --> 30:29.121
-Thank you so much.
-You're so welcome.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.248
-We really had a great time.
-Thank you so much.

30:32.291 --> 30:33.417
Good night.

30:33.959 --> 30:36.670
Thank you again
for such an unbelievable donation.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.505
-See you again next year.
-Can't wait.

30:45.470 --> 30:46.680
What a charmer, huh?

30:47.347 --> 30:48.390
Indeed.

30:51.268 --> 30:55.189
You may think that you're the only one
that can see who he really is...

30:56.690 --> 30:57.691
but you're not.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.325
Oh, boy. You all right, buddy?

31:08.410 --> 31:10.245
-Quick.
-All right.

31:10.329 --> 31:11.330
Fun night.

31:12.915 --> 31:15.125
Hey, wait, hold on. Slow down, Coach.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.964
Will you stop being mad at me now?

31:24.009 --> 31:25.219
I'm sorry, babe.

31:27.638 --> 31:29.598
Do you even know
what you're sorry for, Jamie?

31:30.474 --> 31:31.600
You always ask me that.

31:32.392 --> 31:34.520
Hey, do me a favor.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.605
Don't use me as a prop
in your little fights.

31:37.564 --> 31:38.732
Made me feel like an idiot.

31:41.068 --> 31:42.903
I'm sorry. I--

31:43.445 --> 31:44.655
I shouldn't have done that.

31:45.906 --> 31:46.907
Thanks.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.868
No one was bidding on you anyway, mate.
Just fuck off.

31:51.411 --> 31:52.412
Go on.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.210
What are you saying sorry to him for?

31:58.710 --> 32:00.712
Being accountable matters, Jamie.

32:03.674 --> 32:04.675
We're done.

32:06.093 --> 32:07.094
I'll see you around.

32:10.931 --> 32:11.932
Whatever.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.566
Excuse me, can I take these?

32:20.649 --> 32:21.650
Two?

32:31.451 --> 32:33.120
Do you wanna go get, like, really drunk?

32:33.537 --> 32:36.248
-Yes, I do.
-Then we can go rob a bank or something.

32:43.005 --> 32:45.048
Michelle and Henry
are coming out next weekend.

32:45.132 --> 32:46.508
-Hey, that's great, Coach.
-Yeah.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.511
So come on, tell me about you and Jane.
What happened?

32:50.095 --> 32:51.221
I did it again.

32:51.305 --> 32:54.016
-Put the game before the dame, huh?
-Yup.

32:54.099 --> 32:55.809
When are you gonna learn, Coach?
