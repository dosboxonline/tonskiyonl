WEBVTT

00:50.801 --> 00:51.468
Alright.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.845
Are we finally leaving?

00:52.845 --> 00:54.471
A suspect has been
located in the hotel.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.432
But don't worry Mr. Martinez,
your client is perfectly safe.

00:57.432 --> 00:59.560
I've assigned my best
people to the operation.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.522
Gibert calling Alan.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.900
You've reached the police.
Please wait on the line.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.901
I've located the suspect.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.987
Distance...
About 15 meters.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.989
- Join me.
- Right away, boss.

01:12.823 --> 01:13.991
Concentrate, Alan.

01:14.616 --> 01:16.869
Do you see the suspect,
at 11 o'clock?

01:17.661 --> 01:19.830
No, "at 11 o'clock"
is a term used in the navy.

01:19.830 --> 01:22.916
You've been in Marseille for 10 years
and I bet you haven't seen the sea.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.377
Actually I have, when making
my rounds at the port.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.336
Fine.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.883
At 12 o'clock is straight ahead
and at 11 o'clock is this way.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.176
Straight and to the left.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.053
Ah yes, indeed.

01:36.013 --> 01:39.516
Are you sure this is the suspect?
I think it's rather a hotel maid.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.225
But of course.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.186
Do you think a terrorist
moves around yelling

01:42.186 --> 01:43.812
and wearing an explosive belt?

01:44.104 --> 01:45.522
- No.
- Exactly.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.900
They disguise themselves.

01:48.025 --> 01:51.278
And is there a better disguise than
a hotel maid pushing a cart?

01:51.236 --> 01:52.571
- I'm asking you.
- Sure.

01:52.905 --> 01:54.323
Especially in a hotel.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.909
Do you hear the song
that rat is humming

01:56.909 --> 01:58.076
to give himself courage?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.662
Ah yes.
Is that Spanish?

02:00.662 --> 02:03.123
That's a revolutionary song,
my little Alan.

02:11.882 --> 02:14.384
On my command
neutralize the Basque.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.385
Roger that.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.555
At 12 o'clock!

02:20.349 --> 02:21.391
And we're done!

02:21.391 --> 02:22.851
Let that nightingale sing.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.645
Put him in a cage.
I'll question him later.

02:24.895 --> 02:25.771
Go!

02:29.691 --> 02:30.901
Gibert, how's it going?

02:30.901 --> 02:33.820
Mr. Prefect, I've just neutralized
the Spanish terrorist.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.864
He was transporting
a set of little bottles.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.533
Most likely toxic substances

02:37.533 --> 02:38.700
he was going to spread.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.660
I'll have it tested.

02:39.660 --> 02:40.744
Excellent, Gibert.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.454
And now take care
of our client,

02:42.454 --> 02:44.164
because we can't allow
ourselves to be late.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.624
Consider it done, Mr. Prefect.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.045
Emilién, the coast is clear.
You can deliver the package.

02:50.796 --> 02:51.713
Emilién?

02:52.422 --> 02:53.924
Emilién, answer right away!

02:54.800 --> 02:56.552
I'm practically standing
in the exit door.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.971
We can't do this while
I'm on a special mission.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.180
It's not my fault.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.474
You look so handsome when
you're on a special mission.

03:02.558 --> 03:04.476
You look like Sean Connery
and you turn me on.

03:04.434 --> 03:05.477
Sean Connery...

03:05.477 --> 03:06.770
Please, don't make fun of me.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.438
You enjoy this
because you're stronger.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.399
Alright, you can tie
me up next time.

03:10.566 --> 03:12.484
Not so loud.
The hotel is bugged.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.695
Yes sir, inspector.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.989
I'll take care of the package,
and you find Gibert.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.328
I love you, Emilién.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.122
I love you too, Petra.
But this isn't the time.

03:25.289 --> 03:26.832
See you at home tonight.

03:32.880 --> 03:33.547
Mr. Cissé?

03:34.131 --> 03:37.301
Mr. Cissé, we need to end the interview,
to be on the pitch in 20 minutes.

03:42.931 --> 03:46.018
I'm sorry to disturb you
but I'm from the police and...

03:46.435 --> 03:47.519
What's your name?

03:47.561 --> 03:48.353
Emilién.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.233
No, this isn't about...
This is about...

03:53.233 --> 03:53.901
Emilién!

03:53.901 --> 03:56.111
This isn't the time
to exchange business cards.

03:56.445 --> 03:57.237
Where is that...

03:58.989 --> 04:01.158
What a name.
Damn foreigner.

04:01.158 --> 04:02.701
That's Djibril Cissé, sir.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.285
Excuse me?

04:03.285 --> 04:06.788
Don't get wise with me or I'll check
your papers and have you deported.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.124
Emilién, look.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.334
They don't look alike.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.835
The nose, the teeth.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.588
But it's certainly him,
I assure you.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.964
Not so fast, Emilién.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.423
I know about deception.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.260
I worked for 2 years in customs,
so I saw plenty of impostors.

04:20.260 --> 04:23.388
For example that Korean subsidiary in 82.
I smoked them out.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.641
- But he's not Korean.
- How can you be sure?

04:25.641 --> 04:26.767
I checked his papers.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.937
- His eyes are a bit slanted.
- That's because he's tired.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.356
We have to go or the Prefect
will grow impatient.

04:32.397 --> 04:32.898
Yes.

04:33.565 --> 04:34.483
Head to the car!

04:40.072 --> 04:43.033
I don't know what you did to them,
but you aren't popular here.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.999
Don't worry.
He doesn't know anything about soccer.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.084
His passion is fishing.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.752
What are you mumbling, Emilién?

04:53.752 --> 04:55.838
I just said that
your passion is fishing.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.506
Fishing is a real sport.

04:57.506 --> 04:58.966
Do you ever fill
a fishing net?

04:58.966 --> 05:01.343
No, my job is to put
the ball in the goal net.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.471
That's good.
Because fishing isn't for amateurs.

05:04.596 --> 05:08.433
For example consider float fishing,
on the lakeside.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.728
Sometimes you have to
stand motionless for 8 hours

05:11.770 --> 05:12.896
observing the float.

05:12.938 --> 05:13.689
And then...

05:21.738 --> 05:22.656
What's going on?

05:22.656 --> 05:23.991
Are you OK?
Break anything?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.117
No.
I'm fine.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.120
Couldn't you have turned
on the signal?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.539
We were told Mr. Cissé
is having a siesta at the hotel,

05:30.539 --> 05:31.665
so we avoided waking him.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.958
He's not having a siesta.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.127
He's in my car
and he's being transferred.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.963
Djibril Cissé is being transferred?
He'll play for Marseille?

05:38.839 --> 05:39.756
It's Cissé.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.844
Do something or we'll be late.

05:43.886 --> 05:44.887
Don't worry.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.889
I know someone who'll
get us out of here.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.769
You have taxis in the police?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.646
No, he rather belongs
to the Air Force.

05:57.608 --> 05:59.151
Marseille Express at your service.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.360
Daniel, no time for jokes.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.779
Mr. Cissé has to be at
the Vélodrome in 10 minutes.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.697
Mr. Djibril.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.116
Nice to have you.
Will you be playing in Marseille?

06:06.033 --> 06:08.452
I'm taking part in a charity match
and I'm going to be late.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.995
Since it's for a good cause.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.228
I'll change clothes in the car,
to gain some time.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.187
You can always try.

06:38.357 --> 06:41.068
Mom, you'll never believe
who's going to play for Marseille.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.781
That's not the right way.
We're leaving Marseille.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.616
We'll go around to
avoid the traffic jams.

06:58.961 --> 07:03.298
I assure you, Djibril Cissé,
no. 9, playing for Olympique de Marseille.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.970
Now this is a road.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.012
Real driving.

07:09.263 --> 07:10.347
We can't hear the engine.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.140
At this speed all
we hear is the wind.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.226
This just in.

07:14.226 --> 07:20.023
Olympique de Marseille has acquired
an exceptional player, Djibril Cissé.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.531
A speeding white taxi
will be there in 1 minute.

07:27.906 --> 07:28.866
Roger that.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.660
It must be our
little Daniel.

07:32.244 --> 07:33.787
At his speed
we have no chance.

07:33.912 --> 07:36.373
- Shall we send the new guy?
- Damn. Are you kidding?

07:36.373 --> 07:38.292
What's wrong?
He's new, let him learn.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.210
Hey, new guy?

07:40.335 --> 07:41.086
Yes, boss?

07:41.170 --> 07:42.671
Stand next to the radar

07:42.963 --> 07:45.507
and set it to "extra sensitive".

07:45.507 --> 07:47.176
- Alright?
- Yes, sir.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.971
Attention, here comes
the TGV train.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.556
Step away from the platform.

07:59.188 --> 08:00.105
Thanks, kid.

08:00.105 --> 08:00.814
You did well.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.108
The measurement is more effective
on "extra sensitive".

08:07.446 --> 08:08.780
Your taxi is quite fast.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.115
I have my tricks.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.659
I recovered some parts from
the Concorde, when it was scrapped.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.369
Slow down, I don't want
to miss the exit.

08:14.411 --> 08:15.621
I've just received confirmation.

08:15.621 --> 08:19.500
The Marseille club has made the transfer
of the year for 60 million euro.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.635
All the spots are full.

08:29.635 --> 08:31.887
Drive to the underground parking.
I know it like my pocket.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.097
I'm not sure why, but I worry
when you say that.

08:35.807 --> 08:38.519
Djibril Cissé's arrival
to Olympique de Marseille

08:38.519 --> 08:42.813
is fueling rumors and insane amounts
of money are being mentioned.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.316
To find out more,

08:44.316 --> 08:47.819
we'll go live to our reporter
at the Vélodrome stadium.

08:48.820 --> 08:52.032
I'm coming to you live from
Marseille for this friendly match

08:52.032 --> 08:54.368
being played for the
Association of Sick Children.

08:54.576 --> 08:58.288
And maybe that's why the players
have demanded insane amounts,

08:58.288 --> 09:02.292
since there is talk of
a contract worth 200 million euro.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.837
We'll invite him to
the microphone of TF1,

09:04.962 --> 09:07.214
but until now the star
has failed to arrive.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.050
Cissé or not, if he's not here
in a minute, I'm starting the match.

09:15.681 --> 09:16.640
Try taking a right here.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.600
Emilién, we've taken a right
here twice already.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.435
Are you sure you know it
like your pocket?

09:20.435 --> 09:22.855
Yes. I was responsible for
security during the pope's visit.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.023
We spent 6 days here looking
for Gibert, who got lost.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.149
That sounds promising.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.694
I don't know the parking,
but I'll trust my intuition.

09:30.863 --> 09:31.697
We're starting.

09:41.165 --> 09:42.374
7 minutes and 32 seconds.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.250
Thanks for the ride.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.334
Thanks for the show.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.273
We have a better view
here than on TV.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.025
But you're in the
middle of the pitch.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.069
Take a seat in the stands
or it's a yellow card.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.279
Of course, Mr. referee.

10:30.172 --> 10:31.173
What an idiot.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.736
- Foul.
- He's on crutches.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.997
- Free kick.
- What's his problem?

11:54.047 --> 11:57.384
Warm up and stretch your legs.
I don't want any injuries during play.

12:10.731 --> 12:11.773
Do you like the shirt?

12:11.773 --> 12:12.816
Yes, but it's too big.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.193
You'll ask mom to wash it.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.987
It'll shrink and be
the right size.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.405
The logo will come off.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.782
I'll ask mom to wash
around the logo.

12:21.158 --> 12:21.950
Listen to me.

12:22.159 --> 12:24.161
I'd like to see you play
longer than 3 minutes,

12:24.161 --> 12:25.704
so no red card, OK?

12:25.871 --> 12:26.580
OK.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.415
Go.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.668
The first rule is that you
never touch the ball, OK?

12:31.668 --> 12:32.169
OK.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.005
And if someone passes you the ball,
kick it right away.

12:35.005 --> 12:35.756
Which way?

12:35.756 --> 12:38.091
Don't worry about that.
Kick it and let the others worry.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.344
Could I finally get
to play soccer?

12:40.344 --> 12:42.262
Daddy will play
with you later.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.599
Go, my son.

12:45.557 --> 12:46.225
Go.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.185
And don't run too fast.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.947
Are you sure he won't
catch a cold?

12:59.947 --> 13:00.614
Don't worry.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.242
I gave him a heated shirt
and plenty of vitamin C this morning.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.035
Then he's really
in no danger.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.955
You should have signed him up for hockey,
to amortize the equipment.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.665
Are you nuts?
That's too dangerous.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.416
His mother wanted him
to take up karate.

13:11.500 --> 13:13.335
But luckily I have the
file of the club manager.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.337
He accepted to refuse him,
without Petra knowing.

13:15.337 --> 13:17.089
Emilién, he'll be at risk
his whole life.

13:17.089 --> 13:18.465
So he better get
used to it.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.175
Yes, but that can wait.

13:20.259 --> 13:21.426
What about swimming?

13:21.426 --> 13:22.177
No.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.137
His bronchi are too frail.
It's hereditary.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.849
And you never broke anything
when you were little?

13:26.849 --> 13:28.308
Yes, my arm.
3 times.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.059
See.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.019
But that didn't
make me any smarter

13:31.019 --> 13:33.146
or get me a place
at the police academy.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.983
Maybe you'd have been
better off breaking a leg.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.737
Very good, my son!

13:43.699 --> 13:45.367
Who will our kids
grow up to be?

13:46.285 --> 13:46.952
What?

13:47.244 --> 13:49.872
Do you think mine will be
a cab driver, and yours a cop?

13:49.997 --> 13:50.622
Why not?

13:50.998 --> 13:52.166
That's nothing bad.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.585
We both help others.
That's beautiful in itself.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.628
It could be worse.
It could be the exact opposite.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.672
Mine a cab driver,
and yours a cop.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.299
Don't mention such misfortune.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.139
Emilién, yes?

14:08.932 --> 14:09.766
Emilién?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.351
What urgent matter?

14:11.476 --> 14:14.188
Gibert told you that?
But I'm not working today.

14:13.937 --> 14:14.688
Emilién?

14:15.063 --> 14:16.190
Are you alright Maxim?

14:16.273 --> 14:17.482
No, that's not possible.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.567
Emilién, you'd better...

14:18.859 --> 14:20.152
Alright.
I'm coming.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.863
Daniel, Gibert is summoning everyone
for an urgent matter.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.115
Can you take care of Maxim?
Petra is on a secret mission.

14:25.115 --> 14:27.534
I can't call her.
And my mother is on a pilgrimage to Lourdes.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.202
To Lourdes?

14:28.202 --> 14:29.912
She goes there every year
since my birth.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.288
Such a miracle
must be celebrated.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.707
- Take my stuff to the station after the game.
- No problem.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.876
Just don't take them
to the port for sweets.

14:35.876 --> 14:36.376
Sure.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.046
They'll get a slice of bread,
a cup of water and go to bed.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.339
I'm kidding.

14:40.339 --> 14:40.964
Go.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.299
I'll take care of him
like my own.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.300
That's what I'm afraid of.

14:43.300 --> 14:45.802
Emilién, your son visits
me every Wednesday.

14:45.844 --> 14:48.764
And he's never complained.
He never returns with warts on his face.

14:48.764 --> 14:49.223
No.

14:49.223 --> 14:50.891
So get moving
and go to work.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.517
OK.

14:53.685 --> 14:55.854
4 minutes and 30 seconds without
a card is your record.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.606
But I didn't do anything.

14:57.606 --> 15:01.068
That referee gives out cards
to every promising player.

15:01.944 --> 15:03.862
Go get Maxim.
I'll take you to the port.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.614
Come on Max,
we're going to the port.

15:11.829 --> 15:13.747
Stop that ball this instant!

15:14.373 --> 15:15.415
I got it, boss.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.251
Bring me that ball.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.549
It won't piss me off anymore.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.552
Here kids.
You can play on.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.055
Alright, gentlemen...

15:30.305 --> 15:34.768
This isn't the time for dribbling, footwork
or any other soccer nonsense.

15:34.810 --> 15:36.353
I've talked on the
phone with Paris.

15:36.353 --> 15:39.398
They're sending us
a very special package.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.067
It's this year's
biggest transfer.

15:42.067 --> 15:42.693
Drogba?

15:42.734 --> 15:43.318
Thuram?

15:43.318 --> 15:44.570
No, I know.
Makelele?

15:44.570 --> 15:45.153
Beckenbauer?

15:45.153 --> 15:45.904
Maradona?

15:46.154 --> 15:47.739
You're a real
bunch of morons.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.949
I'm not talking about tennis.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.909
I'm talking about a criminal.

15:51.076 --> 15:51.743
Tapie?

15:53.537 --> 15:54.788
This one is even more famous.

15:54.830 --> 15:57.374
According to his file,
he's public enemy no. 1.

15:57.416 --> 15:59.042
It's...

16:04.047 --> 16:05.007
Boss...

16:06.800 --> 16:08.051
That's yesterday's transfer.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.970
So where's my paper?

16:09.970 --> 16:12.556
It's written on the back.
You asked us to save paper.

16:12.556 --> 16:13.390
Yes, that's true.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.641
That was my wife's idea.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.311
She saw a TV show about the destruction
of the Amazon forests.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.689
Do you know how many acres
of forest are destroyed each day?

16:21.899 --> 16:23.817
- 3? 6?
- I don't know.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.526
How many?

16:26.695 --> 16:29.072
If you knew,
it would make you shudder.

16:29.448 --> 16:30.115
How many?

16:30.115 --> 16:34.453
It's millions of matchboxes being
cut down and going up in flames.

16:34.453 --> 16:36.872
So...
When the opportunity presents itself...

16:36.872 --> 16:38.457
Respect your papers.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.168
Respect the paper.
Economize.

16:41.210 --> 16:43.045
Boss, and that public enemy no. 1?

16:43.045 --> 16:43.879
Yes...

16:43.921 --> 16:45.339
He's a Belgian,

16:45.339 --> 16:47.966
whose name I won't pronounce
because it makes me feel sick.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.135
53 armed robberies.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.929
Accomplice to 122 murders.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.889
There hasn't been anyone
worse since Al Capone.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.058
He's being transferred to Congo,

16:56.058 --> 16:58.185
where he'll be tried
in 10 criminal cases.

16:58.185 --> 16:59.645
Transit in Marseille.

16:59.728 --> 17:04.441
We take care of him from the time
of his arrival until 5 a.m. tomorrow.

17:04.441 --> 17:07.194
And we put him on a plane
of the Congo authorities.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.820
This Belgian won't have
the time to tour the city.

17:10.821 --> 17:13.659
Surveillance must be ultra tight.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.036
One police officer per square inch.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.623
I want so many officers around him,
so that he can't see the sea.

17:19.665 --> 17:21.083
Do you understand?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.209
Yes, boss!

17:22.376 --> 17:24.627
At what time is that monster
of the Ardennes flying in?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.797
Good question, Emilién.

17:26.797 --> 17:27.714
At exactly 3 p.m.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.466
Boss, it's already 3:05.

17:29.925 --> 17:31.176
It's 12:05 on mine.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.596
Head to the cars!

17:35.180 --> 17:37.307
Maxim, is this what
you ordered?

17:37.975 --> 17:39.059
So why aren't you eating?

17:39.059 --> 17:42.604
Because my dad says that such
a cake only gets you stains all over.

17:42.604 --> 17:46.483
You'll show your dad that's not
the case and you won't stain yourself.

17:53.866 --> 17:54.950
Damn, your father.

17:54.950 --> 17:55.951
Leo, hide under the table.

17:55.951 --> 17:57.619
What's this in the
middle of the street?

17:57.619 --> 17:59.204
Get out of the way.
Police.

17:59.204 --> 18:00.539
She's caught a flat tire.

18:00.539 --> 18:02.207
I can't leave her
alone in this heat.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.208
He's right, boss.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.209
She'll dehydrate.

18:04.209 --> 18:05.294
We need to help her.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.462
I'm a certified life guard.
I'll help her.

18:07.462 --> 18:09.298
I was a florist
before being a cop.

18:09.298 --> 18:11.091
Nobody move!

18:17.890 --> 18:20.350
Isn't he ashamed?
He should be behind bars.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.519
How much time does it take
to change a tire?

18:22.519 --> 18:23.645
It doesn't take 3 hours.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.772
Around here we
take our time.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.567
Thank you.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.860
Finally.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.111
Go.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.414
Is the cake good at least?

18:54.885 --> 18:57.137
- Mr. General.
- Gibert, explain yourself.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.263
I'm sorry for being late.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.557
We took a shortcut thru the port,
but caught a flat tire.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.226
Does it take an hour
to change a tire?

19:02.184 --> 19:04.311
It now takes the
police a whole week.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.979
The training of recruits
is getting worse.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.439
They learn to shoot on day 1.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.901
But between you and me,
we change tires more often than we shoot.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.320
Do you have the same
problem in the army?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.613
No.
We have caterpillars.

19:14.613 --> 19:15.948
Caterpillars.
Very good.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.032
They go everywhere.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.731
That's funny.
This reminds me of my vacation in Africa.

19:49.898 --> 19:52.234
They had the same cages
and we slept in them,

19:52.234 --> 19:54.069
to protect ourselves
from the wild animals.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.988
This animal is of
the worst kind, Gibert.

19:55.988 --> 19:56.822
If it escapes,

19:56.822 --> 19:59.950
it will burn down the city and kill
everyone before you change a tire.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.577
Don't worry,
Mr. General.

20:01.577 --> 20:03.829
We're used to such
characters in Marseille.

20:03.829 --> 20:05.164
One day they're limping
on one leg,

20:05.164 --> 20:07.166
and the next they're healthy
and playing soccer.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.001
Load him up.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.215
And we're done.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.302
Gibert, be careful with this package.
Your career depends on it.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.803
Don't worry, Mr. General.

20:19.803 --> 20:21.221
Consider it done.

20:21.221 --> 20:22.181
Let's sync our watches.

20:22.306 --> 20:24.016
- 4:20.
- 12:05. Perfect.

20:24.016 --> 20:25.350
We'll be in touch
every 2 hours.

20:25.350 --> 20:26.768
Forward!

20:31.648 --> 20:32.816
Hello, this is Gibert.

20:33.317 --> 20:34.276
Mr. General.

20:34.359 --> 20:34.985
Already?

20:34.985 --> 20:35.819
Yes, already.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.989
You've been gone 30 seconds,
and already you've made a blunder.

20:38.989 --> 20:39.573
How so?

20:39.573 --> 20:40.908
Look in the mirror.

20:42.493 --> 20:43.285
A price tag.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.454
Of course.
Now I see better.

20:45.454 --> 20:46.622
Thank you, Mr. General.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.667
Gibert, I meant the exterior mirror.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.211
Now look to your right.

20:54.171 --> 20:55.130
Holy crap!

20:55.130 --> 20:56.798
Stop the cars!

21:11.980 --> 21:14.525
- Are you sure this is the place?
- I'm 100% sure.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.485
Alright, this is
what we'll do.

21:16.818 --> 21:19.363
You'll stay in the car.
I'll be better off on my own.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.698
And if...
And I emphasize the "if".

21:21.698 --> 21:23.784
If I'm not back in 30 minutes,
come and get me.

21:23.784 --> 21:24.827
OK, fine.

21:26.078 --> 21:26.912
What?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.123
Call me before
you let him out.

21:30.499 --> 21:31.708
It'll be safer that way.

21:31.917 --> 21:32.793
No problem.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.262
Damn.
What a throw.

22:01.738 --> 22:02.823
COMMISSIONAIRE GIBERT

22:20.841 --> 22:21.633
OK.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.343
Get to work, Serge.

22:27.639 --> 22:28.557
Hi, Daniel.

22:28.724 --> 22:31.435
I found this a mile down the road.
Does it belong to you?

22:31.435 --> 22:33.979
Damn, I knew it had
rolled off somewhere.

22:33.979 --> 22:34.813
Thanks.

22:34.980 --> 22:37.191
- Hi, kids.
- They're growing up fast.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.443
Hi, Maxim.
We know each other.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.528
Luckily he doesn't
look like his dad.

22:42.446 --> 22:43.280
OK, let's go.

22:43.280 --> 22:45.199
Emilién hasn't returned yet.

22:45.407 --> 22:47.367
No problem. I'll put them in
front of the computer.

22:48.952 --> 22:51.079
Does your dad have anything
against video games?

22:52.372 --> 22:54.124
Now you have something to do.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.918
I'll be gone 5 minutes.
I'll make a call.

22:55.918 --> 22:56.919
Be good.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.216
Is someone else using it?

23:02.216 --> 23:05.260
No, they simply gave
my dad the worst computer.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.137
You can barely
send an e-mail.

23:07.179 --> 23:09.431
- And Gibert's computer?
- It's an atom bomb.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.015
SYSTEM ERROR

23:10.015 --> 23:11.350
What's this mess?

23:11.475 --> 23:12.643
Nothing works.

23:13.560 --> 23:16.063
Why don't they make the
newer models more user-friendly?

23:17.981 --> 23:18.690
Yes?

23:18.690 --> 23:19.900
We want to use the computer.

23:20.484 --> 23:21.944
The computer's already in use.

23:21.944 --> 23:23.487
Why don't you go
to another office?

23:23.487 --> 23:26.615
Because this computer is the
latest generation Extreme Core.

23:28.909 --> 23:29.910
SYSTEM ERROR

23:30.494 --> 23:32.079
Do you know how
to use this machine?

23:32.079 --> 23:33.080
Kids' play.

23:34.873 --> 23:35.707
Hi, Marley.

23:35.791 --> 23:36.542
Hi.

23:36.750 --> 23:38.669
Got anything for
a dry throat?

23:38.794 --> 23:40.921
It's the end of the season
and I have little left.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.381
Look in the closet.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.424
HOLLAND.
MOROCCO.

23:44.424 --> 23:45.342
COLUMBIA.

23:46.301 --> 23:47.219
Indeed.

23:49.847 --> 23:50.806
Should I roll 2?

23:50.806 --> 23:52.599
Yeah, maybe I'll
finally wake up.

24:00.274 --> 24:00.983
Here.

24:01.942 --> 24:05.070
Thanks, but I never smoke while on the job.
I'll smoke it at home.

24:05.904 --> 24:06.822
That's funny.

24:06.822 --> 24:09.658
Here it's the other way around.
We smoke at work but never at home.

24:10.951 --> 24:12.077
Damn, it's Gibert.

24:12.119 --> 24:13.370
Damn, the car...

24:23.213 --> 24:24.131
OK, Alan...

24:24.923 --> 24:26.758
Put the animal in
the big office.

24:26.842 --> 24:28.927
- Should I get him out of the cage?
- Of course not.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.805
Must I remind you that
this animal is extremely dangerous?

24:31.805 --> 24:34.433
I know.
But this cage is extremely big.

24:34.433 --> 24:35.893
Don't question my orders.

24:36.226 --> 24:37.186
Execute.

24:41.607 --> 24:42.691
To all units.

24:42.691 --> 24:45.444
The wolf is entering
the sheep house.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.945
Damn, it's Gibert.
Get rid of it.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.756
Wait, Marley.
Come here.

25:06.048 --> 25:07.007
Come here.

25:07.341 --> 25:08.300
Yes, Commissionaire?

25:09.301 --> 25:10.385
Have you been smoking?

25:10.385 --> 25:11.970
No.
I assure you.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.889
Don't tell me stories.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.141
I have an acute sense of smell,
my little Marley.

25:16.141 --> 25:19.102
Last winter I had a 3-month
workshop with rescue dogs.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.812
I sniffed a lot of snow.

25:20.938 --> 25:21.980
I don't doubt it.

25:21.980 --> 25:24.775
At the end of the workshop
I could smell drugs from a mile away.

25:24.775 --> 25:25.943
Unreal...

25:26.235 --> 25:26.944
Yes.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.989
OK, I'll let you go this time.
But it better not happen again.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.411
Type the password.

25:36.995 --> 25:38.497
I type the password.

25:39.957 --> 25:40.999
Upload the picture.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.085
I upload the picture.

25:43.794 --> 25:46.171
First you click the
picture you don't want.

25:46.213 --> 25:48.465
First I click the
picture I don't want.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.342
And you click the picture
you want to keep.

25:53.178 --> 25:54.429
Thanks a lot, boys.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.307
Without you I never
would have managed.

25:57.349 --> 25:59.017
You deserve a little something.

26:00.811 --> 26:02.521
A ticket.
Here you go.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.360
Put it away.
It's our little secret.

26:09.152 --> 26:10.362
What are you
doing here, kids?

26:10.362 --> 26:13.365
I've told you not
to touch my computer.

26:13.365 --> 26:14.032
Go.

26:16.785 --> 26:18.120
And what are
you doing here?

26:18.871 --> 26:20.080
I'm...

26:20.080 --> 26:22.166
You're the new IT trainer?

26:24.626 --> 26:25.335
That's right.

26:25.335 --> 26:26.879
I'm sorry.
It slipped my mind.

26:26.879 --> 26:29.840
The help of a trainer is a must
in case of these machines.

26:30.132 --> 26:32.134
I'm rather talented when
it comes to electronics.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.803
But I must admit that
I'm having a hard time.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.805
OK, let's have a lesson today.

26:36.847 --> 26:40.142
I had a hard day and I feel
my head is going to explode.

26:40.642 --> 26:42.352
Excuse me...
But you're smoking.

26:42.352 --> 26:44.271
No, I stopped
smoking 3 weeks ago.

26:44.271 --> 26:48.192
I generally have a strong will
but this time I got a patch.

26:48.192 --> 26:50.027
- See?
- It suits you.

26:50.736 --> 26:53.197
But I meant you have smoke
coming out your head.

26:53.864 --> 26:55.073
Yes, indeed.

26:55.073 --> 26:56.450
- May I?
- Be my guest.

26:57.868 --> 26:59.286
Where did this come from?

26:59.828 --> 27:01.955
This is from Morocco.

27:02.331 --> 27:05.000
Put it out please.
This is a non-smoking office.

27:05.083 --> 27:05.959
I'm sorry.

27:07.211 --> 27:10.172
OK, can we start the lesson?
I have also other things to do.

27:10.172 --> 27:12.966
Of course. Where did you
finish last lesson?

27:12.966 --> 27:14.176
At adjusting the chair.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.887
Grab the mouse.

27:17.346 --> 27:19.932
One eye on the monitor,
and the other on the keyboard.

27:19.932 --> 27:23.060
One eye on the monitor,
and the other on the keyboard.

27:33.820 --> 27:34.988
This won't be easy.

27:37.366 --> 27:39.368
Are you sure this is
for kids under 6?

27:39.368 --> 27:41.245
Dad, this game is super soft.

27:41.328 --> 27:43.539
We haven't played it for years.

27:45.040 --> 27:45.874
Daniel...

27:46.083 --> 27:48.377
You'll never imagine what
a difficult case I've been given.

27:48.418 --> 27:50.671
It's widely known
I have no imagination.

27:51.046 --> 27:53.590
They've sent us an important client.
A very important client.

27:53.590 --> 27:56.051
- That is?
- He's wanted by every police in Europe.

27:56.051 --> 27:57.010
And they sent him here?

27:57.135 --> 27:59.012
That's good.
He can play some boules.

27:59.012 --> 27:59.972
He won't have time.

27:59.972 --> 28:02.307
Tomorrow at 5 a.m. we'll
put him on a plane to Congo.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.809
If he doesn't escape
in the meantime.

28:03.809 --> 28:06.270
I don't want to make fun of you,
but this isn't a police station.

28:06.270 --> 28:07.312
It's an amusement center.

28:07.312 --> 28:08.146
Exactly, Daniel.

28:10.232 --> 28:13.026
Gibert has summoned everyone
and I have to do overtime.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.572
I've called Petra
but she doesn't answer.

28:16.822 --> 28:18.782
She's still on that
damn secret mission.

28:19.074 --> 28:20.492
So I'm left with
the kid and...

28:20.492 --> 28:23.745
You'd like your friend
Daniel to take care of him.

28:24.496 --> 28:26.790
For 2 or 3 hours until
I'm off duty.

28:27.541 --> 28:28.876
I'll pick him up
after duty.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.836
- Sugar?
- Yes.

28:31.545 --> 28:34.715
When will I get to work?
I've been with the kids since this morning.

28:34.715 --> 28:36.216
Your wife can't take of them?

28:36.216 --> 28:38.177
She's in Paris at a
redecorating exposition.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.469
She redecorates?

28:39.469 --> 28:41.180
She only redecorates garages.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.307
She's decided to
redecorate our garage.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.809
- What a mess...
- That's right.

28:45.893 --> 28:47.519
Even the taxi has
to stand outside.

28:47.519 --> 28:48.478
Can you imagine?

28:48.478 --> 28:50.063
- That's rough.
- Right.

28:51.982 --> 28:53.108
But come to think of it...

28:53.984 --> 28:55.819
It's better for the
taxi to stand outside.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.196
She's putting flowers everywhere.

28:57.196 --> 28:59.448
The flower pollen is
damaging everything.

28:59.531 --> 29:02.201
I spend the weekends cleaning
everything with cotton swabs.

29:02.910 --> 29:05.370
When living with someone you
need to learn to compromise.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.414
And what compromises have
you arrived at with Petra?

29:07.706 --> 29:08.707
A whole bunch.

29:09.541 --> 29:10.292
For example?

29:10.292 --> 29:11.668
For example, my personal things.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.296
When I was single
my things were a mess.

29:14.296 --> 29:17.883
And when Petra saw a shirt lying around
she'd throw it out the window.

29:18.091 --> 29:20.052
- Your boxers too?
- Everything, I'm telling you.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.888
What did you do?
Did you learn to clean up?

29:22.971 --> 29:24.765
Exactly.
And I bought a fishing rod.

29:24.973 --> 29:27.643
I don't have to go
down 3 floors to get my stuff.

29:30.646 --> 29:32.397
When do you want to
pick up your kid?

29:32.397 --> 29:33.982
I'll be off duty
in 2 hours.

29:34.107 --> 29:35.692
OK.
Go for 2 hours.

29:36.235 --> 29:37.653
You're a real pal, Daniel.

29:37.653 --> 29:38.445
Yeah, I know.

29:42.157 --> 29:43.075
Tell me.

29:43.075 --> 29:45.327
Since it'll be the 4
of us without the wives,

29:45.327 --> 29:47.579
how about some pizza
and TV at my garage?

29:47.621 --> 29:48.664
Before the shop closes.

29:48.664 --> 29:49.498
Sold.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.293
Tell me.

29:53.293 --> 29:55.128
What will you do with them
during those 2 hours?

29:55.128 --> 29:56.171
I have an idea.

29:57.589 --> 29:58.549
Grandpa!

29:58.966 --> 30:00.259
Kids!

30:00.259 --> 30:02.177
It's so nice
to see you.

30:02.511 --> 30:04.012
You were supposed
to come on Sunday.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.807
I know, but we were going to the movies
and they saw your house,

30:06.807 --> 30:08.475
and started to scream
wanting to see you.

30:08.475 --> 30:10.727
Yes, grandpa.
I missed you so much.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.271
I want to stay with Leo.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.231
My sweet angels.

30:14.231 --> 30:16.525
I'm here.
Grandpa is here.

30:16.525 --> 30:17.818
Don't worry.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.444
They're so sensitive.

30:19.444 --> 30:21.363
Their mothers are
out of town.

30:21.363 --> 30:22.656
They act like tough guys,

30:22.656 --> 30:24.533
but in fact
they're soft-hearted.

30:26.285 --> 30:27.995
Can I keep them for
a couple of hours?

30:27.995 --> 30:29.413
So that they can calm down.

30:31.498 --> 30:33.250
But not more than 2 hours,
Mr. General.

30:33.250 --> 30:34.376
They have homework to do.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.335
2 hours.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.211
Starting now.

30:43.844 --> 30:45.846
He's been gone an hour.
Shall we go get him?

30:45.846 --> 30:47.723
We'll wait another 5 minutes
and then we'll go.

30:48.098 --> 30:49.141
Up.

30:49.141 --> 30:50.100
That's it.

30:50.100 --> 30:51.894
And now down.
Faster.

30:52.060 --> 30:53.103
Faster...

30:53.478 --> 30:55.230
Up.

30:55.272 --> 30:56.648
See.
It's not so hard.

30:56.607 --> 30:58.609
The most important is
to keep a steady pace.

30:58.609 --> 30:59.276
Boss!

30:59.776 --> 31:01.653
Alan, you made me lose.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.155
How many points
did I score?

31:03.155 --> 31:03.864
8.

31:04.198 --> 31:05.741
Not bad for a first time.

31:06.325 --> 31:07.743
What's the record?

31:07.951 --> 31:09.620
The record is...

31:09.786 --> 31:11.914
20 million, 653 thousand.

31:12.539 --> 31:14.166
- May I?
- Be my guest.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.250
Hello?

31:15.250 --> 31:16.835
It's me.
Shall we come and get you?

31:16.835 --> 31:19.254
No, there's no need.
I'm done here.

31:19.213 --> 31:20.172
I'll be there soon.

31:20.422 --> 31:21.423
OK, fine.

31:21.548 --> 31:22.299
And?

31:22.424 --> 31:23.383
He's fine.

31:23.717 --> 31:25.552
Excuse me, but I have to go.

31:25.802 --> 31:26.386
Already?

31:27.095 --> 31:28.472
Another client is
waiting for me.

31:28.514 --> 31:30.974
Next month at the same hour.

31:31.058 --> 31:32.142
With great pleasure.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.365
Alan, what did you do?
Are you completely nuts?

31:46.824 --> 31:48.617
You gave an order to put
him in the big office.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.828
And orders shouldn't be questioned.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.288
That's true.
You did well, my little Alan.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.548
Take off the cover.
He won't stand here all dressed up.

32:10.556 --> 32:11.932
He's impressive.

32:13.475 --> 32:14.643
Is he really that dangerous?

32:14.643 --> 32:15.644
He's even worse.

32:15.644 --> 32:18.021
He can slit a sheep's
throat with his ears.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.107
Don't be afraid,
my little Emilién.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.943
I spent 5 years in Equatorial Guyana,
eating fried spiders

32:22.943 --> 32:24.945
and counting hippos for UNESCO.

32:24.987 --> 32:27.156
So I won't be scared of
some Belgian, believe me.

32:29.158 --> 32:32.619
We'll start with a routine interrogation.
That'll calm him down.

32:32.619 --> 32:34.163
Alan, get me the papers.

32:34.705 --> 32:35.831
Go ahead, Alan.

32:40.085 --> 32:41.211
First and last name!

32:43.213 --> 32:45.215
So?
How'd it go?

32:45.465 --> 32:47.301
The place is a nuthouse,
I swear.

32:48.218 --> 32:49.428
It gives me the creeps.

32:49.595 --> 32:50.888
Come on, go.

32:57.311 --> 32:58.896
You want to play
the wise guy?

32:58.896 --> 33:00.397
Alan, the Bouches-du-Rhône department.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.065
- Bouches-du-Rhône?
- Yes, Bouches-du-Rhône.

33:02.065 --> 33:02.816
Sure, boss.

33:03.859 --> 33:04.860
You'll see.

33:06.195 --> 33:07.488
Will you answer?

33:11.325 --> 33:12.784
Stay calm!

33:13.243 --> 33:15.996
You still want to
play the wise guy?

33:15.913 --> 33:16.747
Alright.

33:16.747 --> 33:18.916
Alan, there's a hunting
rifle in my desk.

33:18.916 --> 33:19.750
You'll see.

33:21.585 --> 33:24.296
I brought it back from Guyana.
A gift from the head of the reserve.

33:24.588 --> 33:27.090
This dart will put an elephant
to sleep in 5 seconds.

33:27.549 --> 33:29.343
OK, Alan.
Careful, it's loaded.

33:29.343 --> 33:30.260
Keep him at gunpoint.

33:30.260 --> 33:32.638
If he tries to escape,
fire at him.

33:32.638 --> 33:33.847
Without a warning shot?

33:33.889 --> 33:35.432
Of course.
There's only one dart.

33:35.474 --> 33:37.559
What will you use to
put him to sleep?

33:38.477 --> 33:39.603
All the better for me.

33:40.896 --> 33:42.272
Let's continue the interrogation.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.524
First and last name.

33:44.608 --> 33:45.901
What's that?

33:46.443 --> 33:47.611
He's starting to
piss me off.

33:47.611 --> 33:50.864
Don't piss me off.
You don't want to see me pissed off.

33:50.864 --> 33:53.450
Boss, it must be hard for him to
talk with a ball in his mouth.

33:53.450 --> 33:56.537
That's just an excuse.
If he wanted to, he'd talk.

33:57.371 --> 33:58.205
Look, boss.

33:58.497 --> 33:59.998
He's trying to say something.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.583
Let him say it.
That's all we're asking.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.795
Boss, what if we take the
ball out of his mouth?

34:04.795 --> 34:05.587
Not a chance.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.214
Give an arm,
he'll take a finger.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.550
That's what this
little blackboard is for.

34:09.507 --> 34:10.509
There's a blackboard?

34:10.509 --> 34:11.592
Yeah, have a look.

34:11.844 --> 34:13.136
And there's chalk on a chain.

34:13.136 --> 34:14.429
This allows him to communicate.

34:14.429 --> 34:15.097
Very good.

34:15.097 --> 34:16.264
He'll answer us in writing.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.100
Emilién, write
"first and last name".

34:18.391 --> 34:20.853
Boss, he can't talk but
he can hear us very well.

34:23.563 --> 34:24.523
Give him the chalk.

34:25.023 --> 34:27.025
But be careful he doesn't
bite your leg off.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.027
Go ahead, Emilién.

34:38.328 --> 34:39.371
Slowly.

34:46.085 --> 34:47.212
Very good, Emilién.

34:54.469 --> 34:55.596
PEE

34:56.763 --> 34:57.806
What did he write?

35:01.894 --> 35:02.895
- Pee.
- Pee?

35:02.895 --> 35:03.854
That's right.

35:03.854 --> 35:05.856
I understand, but is that
his first or last name?

35:05.981 --> 35:07.900
Boss, I think he wants
to go to the bathroom.

35:10.068 --> 35:11.445
He's not going anywhere.

35:11.445 --> 35:14.490
That trick "I'll go to the
bathroom and run away",

35:14.573 --> 35:16.241
I've seen it a hundred times.

35:16.909 --> 35:19.328
He thinks he'll trick us
with such an old stunt.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.121
Are you kidding me?

35:21.163 --> 35:23.665
There must be something prepared
for such an eventuality.

35:24.750 --> 35:25.959
Look over there.

35:27.377 --> 35:28.462
Look where?

35:31.798 --> 35:33.300
Emilién, do you know
how this works?

35:33.300 --> 35:35.177
Of course.
It's kids' play.

35:35.511 --> 35:37.179
This is the drain pipe.

35:37.179 --> 35:38.805
And this one is for cleaning.
Simple.

35:38.805 --> 35:41.391
They showed us a training video
about new equipment a month ago.

35:41.391 --> 35:42.434
Right, Alan?

35:42.476 --> 35:43.268
Never mind.

35:43.435 --> 35:44.561
Hook him up.

35:45.312 --> 35:47.147
And you keep
him at gunpoint!

35:53.195 --> 35:55.572
Try this and tell
me what you think.

36:07.000 --> 36:09.086
This stuff is strong.
I'm already seeing huge worms.

36:11.296 --> 36:12.840
This connects to the water tap.

36:15.384 --> 36:16.844
And this is placed
in the toilet.

36:19.555 --> 36:20.305
Done.

36:20.764 --> 36:21.640
That was easy.

36:22.266 --> 36:23.350
I hooked up the pipes...

36:24.852 --> 36:26.436
Alan, give me that.

36:26.436 --> 36:27.813
I'm sorry, man.

36:27.813 --> 36:30.357
- I wasn't focused.
- Then focus a little, Alan.

36:30.524 --> 36:33.485
We're at a police station so
you can't go around waving a weapon.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.904
And we have no experience
in shooting at bears.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.116
This thing is used
to shoot at bears.

36:39.283 --> 36:41.285
You have to be careful
in an office.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.203
One finger on the safety catch,

36:43.203 --> 36:45.831
while keeping the weapon
close to the body, like this.

36:49.459 --> 36:50.460
My foot.

36:54.923 --> 36:55.924
There's a chair here.

36:57.718 --> 36:58.594
Lay him down.

36:58.719 --> 37:00.512
He weighs as much as
a couple of people.

37:01.096 --> 37:03.140
Damn...
Look at him.

37:03.140 --> 37:05.017
He looks like he
smoked some carpet.

37:05.017 --> 37:07.394
No, it's some stuff
for bears.

37:07.394 --> 37:08.270
For bears?

37:08.395 --> 37:09.313
You gave him that.

37:09.313 --> 37:11.023
I didn't give him anything.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.024
No, you morons.

37:12.024 --> 37:15.152
He shot himself with
a sleeping dart for bears.

37:15.694 --> 37:17.988
We have to wake him or he'll
hibernate for 6 months.

37:17.988 --> 37:19.698
Consider that...
6 months of peace...

37:20.782 --> 37:22.326
And who will sign
the vacations?

37:24.369 --> 37:25.787
- Get up!
- Wake up!

37:26.205 --> 37:27.789
General alarm!

37:32.419 --> 37:33.795
Where were we?

37:34.880 --> 37:36.215
We were at first
and last name.

37:36.548 --> 37:38.467
Have you become as
stupid as Gibert?

37:38.967 --> 37:39.885
I'm sorry.

37:40.344 --> 37:43.263
I spend the whole day with him
so it's starting to rub off.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.225
Are you OK Belgian?
Did you take a leak?

37:47.142 --> 37:48.977
Did you play
"white men can't piss"?

37:50.395 --> 37:51.438
That was funny.

37:52.314 --> 37:53.565
"White men can't piss".

37:55.567 --> 37:56.652
OK, enough.

37:57.236 --> 38:00.030
That must have been a big pee.
See how his legs have swollen?

38:00.030 --> 38:01.031
But that's not normal.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.159
It should go
out the drain pipe.

38:04.493 --> 38:06.161
But water is flowing inwards.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.329
That's not possible.

38:07.329 --> 38:08.497
Water should flow outwards.

38:08.497 --> 38:09.498
Yes, I know.

38:09.498 --> 38:10.666
Maybe you hooked it up wrong.

38:10.666 --> 38:13.085
No, that's not possible.
I was extra careful.

38:13.085 --> 38:16.046
I connected the drain pipe to the tap,
putting the other pipe in the toilet.

38:16.046 --> 38:17.047
Seems right to me.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.842
Anyway, something's wrong.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.222
I'll go and check.

38:30.602 --> 38:31.895
I messed up again.

38:32.563 --> 38:34.273
I'm such an idiot.

38:37.693 --> 38:39.444
I turned off the water
so it should drop.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.237
It's dropping.
Look.

38:40.237 --> 38:42.114
Before he had two geysers
shooting from his eyes,

38:42.114 --> 38:43.615
and now he has
two little disks.

38:43.615 --> 38:45.742
Damn, we need to get him out of there.
He'll drown.

38:45.742 --> 38:46.702
Are you sure about this?

38:46.785 --> 38:48.871
He's extremely dangerous.
We can't toy with him.

38:48.871 --> 38:51.999
Do you think the death of a Belgian
at a French station is something funny?

38:51.999 --> 38:53.375
You're right.
That isn't funny.

38:55.252 --> 38:57.421
There must be a way to
quickly open this.

38:57.796 --> 38:58.672
See anything?

38:58.839 --> 39:00.257
A button, a lever.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.134
A chain?

39:03.468 --> 39:04.553
No, a handle.

39:04.553 --> 39:06.263
Hurry up.
Grab it on your side.

39:06.513 --> 39:07.556
- Ready?
- Yeah.

39:07.431 --> 39:08.015
One.

39:08.223 --> 39:08.849
Two.

39:16.064 --> 39:17.441
He doesn't look good.

39:18.358 --> 39:19.526
Let's take off the mask.

39:20.277 --> 39:21.111
You do it.

39:21.111 --> 39:23.071
- Why me?
- Go ahead, do it.

39:34.166 --> 39:35.417
This thing is hard
to take off.

39:35.501 --> 39:36.376
Do it slowly.

39:42.299 --> 39:43.300
This is funny.

39:43.717 --> 39:44.968
This isn't how
I imagined him.

39:44.968 --> 39:45.761
Then how?

39:45.761 --> 39:46.512
I don't know...

39:46.512 --> 39:49.389
With a face like...
And teeth like...

39:49.389 --> 39:50.599
And a jaw like...

39:50.599 --> 39:51.934
- Like a monster.
- Yeah. Worse.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.769
The biggest killers
are the most anonymous.

39:53.769 --> 39:55.521
The better they look,
the more careful we are.

39:55.521 --> 39:56.271
Go ahead, wake him.

39:59.316 --> 40:00.317
What are you doing?

40:00.317 --> 40:01.193
I'm being careful.

40:08.700 --> 40:09.576
Sir?

40:10.786 --> 40:11.662
Sir?

40:13.247 --> 40:14.122
Sir?

40:15.123 --> 40:15.999
Sir?

40:20.379 --> 40:21.338
He feels better now.

40:21.839 --> 40:24.132
That's good.
I'm glad.

40:28.303 --> 40:29.221
Where am I?

40:29.221 --> 40:31.223
You're at Marseille's main
police station.

40:34.768 --> 40:36.562
And you're police officers?

40:39.189 --> 40:39.773
Yes.

40:39.773 --> 40:41.316
We're soon to be
chief inspectors.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.443
Soon to be chief inspectors.

40:46.864 --> 40:48.782
- The book?
- No, first the flyswatter.

40:50.826 --> 40:52.202
Stop it!

40:52.286 --> 40:53.495
Stop it.

40:53.495 --> 40:54.163
Listen.

40:54.163 --> 40:55.664
This is a regrettable mistake.

40:55.664 --> 40:59.668
And it's not the fault of the
French police, but the Belgian one.

41:02.588 --> 41:03.547
It's true.

41:10.304 --> 41:11.555
Mr. Albert Vandenbosh.

41:11.555 --> 41:14.516
Wanted by Interpol for
criminal cases in 17 countries.

41:14.516 --> 41:15.392
Memory coming back?

41:15.392 --> 41:16.977
My memory is good
and that's the problem.

41:16.977 --> 41:20.397
My name isn't Albert Vandenbosh
but Fénimore Eugene Triboulet

41:20.397 --> 41:22.608
and I'm an attaché
at the Belgian Embassy.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.778
He thinks we're morons.

41:27.070 --> 41:29.615
1987. Armed robbery on
the Paris-Bouche train.

41:29.531 --> 41:30.908
I did not commit any crime.

41:30.991 --> 41:32.117
I'm an attaché.

41:32.159 --> 41:33.202
You're rather attached.

41:33.202 --> 41:35.662
If you think we'll believe your story,
then you're very mistaken.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.831
Alan, prepare a report
for the boss.

41:38.707 --> 41:40.000
It'll make him happy.

41:40.292 --> 41:41.251
I'll go over to the file.

41:41.752 --> 41:42.753
Write.

41:43.295 --> 41:45.297
Albert Vandenbosh.

41:45.297 --> 41:46.590
Eugene Triboulet, I tell you.

41:46.673 --> 41:48.217
I know that Vandenbosh.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.844
Look at his picture.
He has a different face.

41:50.844 --> 41:51.762
He has a moron's face.

41:52.304 --> 41:53.180
Yeah, sure.

41:53.222 --> 41:53.931
Emilién?

41:54.848 --> 41:55.933
Come and see this.

42:00.646 --> 42:01.605
Who is this?

42:02.773 --> 42:04.233
Albert Vandenbosh.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.359
See?
I told you.

42:05.400 --> 42:07.277
I won't blame you,
it wasn't your fault.

42:07.277 --> 42:08.070
Untie me.

42:08.070 --> 42:10.155
I won't file a complaint
and we can forget about this.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.158
Where did you meet Vandenbosh?

42:13.158 --> 42:14.993
I wouldn't say that
I met him.

42:15.285 --> 42:17.204
I saw him at the
police station in Bruges.

42:17.204 --> 42:18.997
What were you doing
at the station in Bruges?

42:18.997 --> 42:20.249
I came to report a robbery.

42:20.249 --> 42:21.959
I was the victim
of a carjacking.

42:22.000 --> 42:22.459
A car what?

42:22.459 --> 42:24.086
A carjacking.
My Toyota was stolen.

42:24.711 --> 42:27.256
Two guys threw me out of my car
and drove off with it.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.133
In Marseille we call
that a "Parisian".

42:30.259 --> 42:31.677
In Belgium we say "carjacking".

42:31.969 --> 42:33.136
- Carjacking.
- Carjacking.

42:33.387 --> 42:34.263
And then?

42:34.263 --> 42:37.891
I was in the Commissionaire's office,
a kind and hospitable man,

42:37.891 --> 42:40.310
when I felt the need
to go to the bathroom.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.646
You always feel the
need to go pee?

42:43.522 --> 42:45.482
I had some prostate
surgery last year.

42:45.524 --> 42:46.525
I'm sorry.

42:46.525 --> 42:47.401
And then?

42:48.402 --> 42:51.321
I was in the bathroom cabin,
when I stumbled upon Vandenbosh,

42:51.321 --> 42:52.948
who was taking off
this horrible suit.

42:52.990 --> 42:55.492
And then his accomplices
jumped on top of me

42:55.492 --> 42:57.828
and forced me to put on
this horrible attire.

42:57.828 --> 42:59.413
Of course I tried
to defend myself.

42:59.413 --> 43:01.748
But they quickly put
the ball in my mouth

43:01.748 --> 43:04.293
and since then
I couldn't defend myself.

43:04.293 --> 43:05.127
Do you understand?

43:05.169 --> 43:06.503
You're really good.

43:07.087 --> 43:10.299
But unluckily for you,
you've met your match today.

43:10.340 --> 43:11.049
Emilién?

43:11.341 --> 43:12.092
What now?

43:12.092 --> 43:13.385
Can you come and see this?

43:17.681 --> 43:18.557
BELGIAN EMBASSY

43:18.724 --> 43:20.559
FENIMORE EUGENE TRIBOULET
CULTURAL ATTACHE

43:21.018 --> 43:22.352
Fénimore Eugene Triboulet.

43:22.686 --> 43:25.689
Cultural attaché at the Belgian
embassy since 1996.

43:25.689 --> 43:27.983
Since the 17th of May 1996
to be exact.

43:27.983 --> 43:31.820
My nomination was also shown
in the evening TV news.

43:32.112 --> 43:33.113
Is there a number to call?

43:33.113 --> 43:34.156
Yeah, there's the number.

43:34.281 --> 43:34.948
Go ahead, call.

43:35.699 --> 43:36.617
Call them.

43:42.956 --> 43:45.083
Belgian Embassy, hello.
How may I help you?

43:45.083 --> 43:47.336
Hello.
I'd like to talk to Mr. Triboulet.

43:47.336 --> 43:49.880
Unfortunately Mr. Triboulet
has been absent for 3 days.

43:50.589 --> 43:53.217
Do you know where I can find him?
It's an important matter.

43:53.217 --> 43:54.593
To be honest,

43:54.760 --> 43:56.887
we haven't heard from
Mr. Triboulet in 3 days.

43:56.887 --> 43:59.431
and the embassy is
starting to worry.

43:59.431 --> 44:00.682
Are you saying he's disappeared?

44:00.682 --> 44:01.725
Something like that.

44:01.725 --> 44:04.102
We know he went to the station
in Bruges Tuesday morning,

44:04.102 --> 44:06.146
to report the carjacking
of his Toyota.

44:06.438 --> 44:09.024
And since then we
have no news of him.

44:09.149 --> 44:10.400
Are you his father?

44:10.984 --> 44:11.777
No.

44:13.612 --> 44:14.613
That's terrible.

44:15.405 --> 44:16.740
I'll call again later.

44:20.452 --> 44:21.745
Holy cow...

44:23.956 --> 44:25.207
Will you talk?

44:26.333 --> 44:27.835
Go easy on him.

44:28.460 --> 44:30.170
Don't worry.
I have an eye on them.

44:30.546 --> 44:32.798
And you try not to
burn down the station.

44:33.715 --> 44:36.552
Can you borrow me some clothes?
We have a problem with the prisoner.

44:36.552 --> 44:37.594
Yeah, look in the closet.

44:37.761 --> 44:39.596
The boss has a few
shirts to change clothes.

44:41.682 --> 44:42.391
You're right.

44:42.558 --> 44:44.226
He can change clothes
every 10 minutes.

44:45.811 --> 44:46.854
My little Daniel.

44:46.854 --> 44:48.021
You've come at the right time.

44:48.188 --> 44:48.981
Is there a problem?

44:48.981 --> 44:51.900
No, but it would be nice if
you could sign an armistice.

45:05.289 --> 45:06.498
Leo, look over here.

45:10.127 --> 45:11.044
Awesome.

45:11.044 --> 45:13.714
I prefer to die in glory
than to surrender in infamy.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.134
What is that?

45:21.054 --> 45:22.973
Peace.
The war's over.

45:29.062 --> 45:30.189
Are you OK, Mr. General?

45:30.522 --> 45:31.398
I'm fine.

45:32.065 --> 45:32.900
I'm fine.

45:34.318 --> 45:37.946
I lost the battle
but not the war.

45:37.946 --> 45:40.157
If you don't mind the next
battle will be some other time.

45:40.157 --> 45:41.950
I'd like the kids
to do their homework.

45:42.075 --> 45:43.702
Yes.
Of course.

45:44.203 --> 45:45.162
Let's do it this Sunday.

45:45.162 --> 45:46.413
This Sunday.
That's right.

45:46.580 --> 45:47.581
The day of Our Father.

45:48.123 --> 45:49.124
It'll make Him happy.

45:49.458 --> 45:50.292
Yes.

45:50.792 --> 45:52.419
And we'll eat an apple pie.

45:52.419 --> 45:54.046
Very good.
I'll take care of that.

45:54.046 --> 45:55.672
Go to the car.

45:58.217 --> 46:01.428
You were supposed to be good for 2 hours,
and not destroy his living room.

46:01.428 --> 46:03.931
He started it.
We wanted to play checkers.

46:03.931 --> 46:06.141
But he said that checkers
are a game for faggots.

46:06.141 --> 46:08.227
Checkers are a game for faggots?
He said that?

46:08.769 --> 46:10.521
And do you know what
a "faggot" is?

46:10.521 --> 46:12.564
A "faggot" is a flyswatter.

46:12.856 --> 46:15.776
My dad says there are plenty
of faggots at the office.

46:20.322 --> 46:23.659
I don't know what these flies
ate this summer but they're huge.

46:26.328 --> 46:28.539
Your boss must be
really well-built.

46:28.914 --> 46:31.625
These clothes are a little too big
but you look good in them.

46:31.625 --> 46:34.169
This isn't exactly my style
but I won't be picky.

46:34.169 --> 46:36.171
Better this than
that diving suit.

46:36.171 --> 46:37.130
That's for sure.

46:44.054 --> 46:45.305
This one is huge.

46:49.226 --> 46:50.102
Are you nuts?

46:50.102 --> 46:51.144
Sorry, man.

46:51.144 --> 46:53.355
But there was a giant
fly right here.

46:55.899 --> 46:57.776
Giant flies and worms.
I know what you're saying.

46:57.776 --> 46:59.153
I have something
to make it go away.

46:59.153 --> 47:01.572
I assure you...
Where did it go?

47:01.572 --> 47:03.407
How many of these
flyswatters do you have?

47:03.824 --> 47:05.075
No, it's not at
all like that.

47:05.075 --> 47:05.909
I'll explain.

47:05.909 --> 47:08.203
Our boss loves fly fishing.

47:09.037 --> 47:10.247
And his birthday is coming up,

47:10.247 --> 47:12.708
so we're collecting
some flies for him.

47:13.417 --> 47:14.418
It'll be a surprise.

47:16.920 --> 47:17.963
Excuse me.

47:18.755 --> 47:19.381
OK...

47:20.048 --> 47:21.091
Give you a ride?

47:21.884 --> 47:23.468
No, thank you.
I'll take a cab.

47:24.553 --> 47:25.470
Bye.

47:26.889 --> 47:28.098
And once again I'm sorry.

47:33.562 --> 47:34.354
Daniel.

47:34.354 --> 47:35.439
Is Emilién off duty?

47:35.439 --> 47:36.815
He has an hour left.

47:37.107 --> 47:40.527
Tell him I'm with the kids.
I'll get the pizzas and we'll meet at my place.

47:40.527 --> 47:41.778
Alright.
I'll tell him.

47:41.862 --> 47:42.905
- Bye.
- Thanks.

47:52.247 --> 47:55.042
You've arrived at the right time.
I was looking for a means of transport.

47:55.042 --> 47:56.835
Where should I drive you, sir?

47:56.835 --> 47:58.462
Number 4, Mediterranean Square.

47:58.462 --> 47:59.338
Nice address.

47:59.338 --> 48:00.672
And may I ask for a favor?

48:00.672 --> 48:01.507
Which is?

48:01.507 --> 48:03.967
I know that French Riviera inhabitants
live at their own pace,

48:03.967 --> 48:06.345
because of the sun, which induces
them to take siestas.

48:06.345 --> 48:10.182
But the sun has set and the heat
has subsided so I won't play the tourist.

48:10.182 --> 48:11.975
So could you step on it,

48:11.975 --> 48:14.561
so that I may arrive at my
destination as soon as possible?

48:14.561 --> 48:15.896
The port of Marseille,

48:16.230 --> 48:17.022
for Marseille.

48:17.022 --> 48:17.940
Right?

48:18.315 --> 48:20.943
You better buckle up
instead of being a wise guy.

48:20.943 --> 48:21.652
What?

48:25.322 --> 48:27.074
- Disgusting.
- What a stench.

48:28.659 --> 48:29.576
I deserved it.

48:34.915 --> 48:36.124
Have a nice stay in Marseille.

48:36.583 --> 48:37.376
Bye.

48:46.552 --> 48:48.387
Delta 1, the sardine has arrived.

48:48.387 --> 48:49.680
Your turn,
Delta 3.

48:49.805 --> 48:51.515
Roger that.
We're on our way.

48:51.515 --> 48:52.349
We're starting.

48:57.062 --> 48:59.940
This is better than those clothes
that smelled like sardines.

49:00.315 --> 49:01.900
Did you get all the
things I asked for?

49:01.900 --> 49:02.693
Everything's ready.

49:02.693 --> 49:03.735
What about the specialist?

49:03.735 --> 49:06.488
It's not easy to find
someone competent in this town.

49:06.488 --> 49:07.573
So I had to...

49:07.865 --> 49:10.701
Serge, I'm not asking
how brilliant you were,

49:10.701 --> 49:12.494
but whether you
found a specialist.

49:12.494 --> 49:13.495
The best of the best.

49:13.495 --> 49:15.747
Then get me a meeting with him,
if you don't mind.

49:15.747 --> 49:16.415
Of course.

49:16.665 --> 49:18.458
I asked him to
pay you a visit.

49:19.793 --> 49:20.669
That must be him.

49:34.474 --> 49:36.226
Do we kiss or shake hands?

49:36.226 --> 49:37.728
Given the choice,
I'll pick the kiss.

49:40.063 --> 49:41.648
In Belgium it's 3.

49:44.401 --> 49:46.320
It's an honor to
work for you.

49:46.320 --> 49:48.780
- What do you know about my work?
- Work. What a vulgar word.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.866
I prefer to speak
of your masterpiece.

49:51.533 --> 49:52.367
She's good.

49:52.534 --> 49:53.327
OK.

49:53.327 --> 49:54.161
When do we start?

49:54.620 --> 49:55.329
Not so fast.

49:55.412 --> 49:56.747
I'm a softy for compliments,

49:56.872 --> 49:58.874
but before we begin,
I have to test you.

49:58.874 --> 49:59.875
A sort of ritual.

50:01.877 --> 50:02.711
I'll close my eyes.

50:02.711 --> 50:04.046
I'll hold you close.

50:04.046 --> 50:07.257
And you'll try, I repeat,
you'll try to steal something

50:07.257 --> 50:08.467
without me noticing.

50:08.467 --> 50:10.135
You have 1 minute.
Starting now.

50:11.803 --> 50:13.597
I set it to the
right time.

50:13.805 --> 50:15.098
It was running a minute late.

50:16.266 --> 50:17.643
She's really very good.

50:17.768 --> 50:19.144
Where did you recruit her?

50:22.356 --> 50:23.232
It's no use.

50:23.232 --> 50:26.401
We've tried the books but he's not
interested in any of them.

50:26.401 --> 50:26.944
OK...

50:26.985 --> 50:28.237
I see only one solution.

50:28.695 --> 50:30.864
- He's here.
- Where's the bear?

50:34.868 --> 50:35.828
His nose is warm.

50:36.078 --> 50:37.621
He's not a bear,
he's a commissionaire.

50:37.621 --> 50:40.082
He shot himself with a sleeping dart.
We need to wake him.

50:40.207 --> 50:42.835
That's what I thought because
I've never seen such a species.

50:44.294 --> 50:45.671
I'll apply the antidote.

50:46.129 --> 50:47.631
This dose is
for an elephant,

50:47.631 --> 50:49.550
but it works the same way
in case of a bear.

50:50.008 --> 50:51.176
Do you know what
you're doing?

50:51.176 --> 50:51.760
Yes.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.637
The most important is
to aim properly,

50:53.637 --> 50:56.807
above the trunk
and between the eyes.

50:59.017 --> 51:00.769
- Emilién!
- I'm here, boss.

51:01.562 --> 51:02.729
Are you OK?
What's wrong?

51:02.729 --> 51:04.481
That's a normal reaction.

51:04.481 --> 51:06.483
He should lie some
time in his basket.

51:09.194 --> 51:10.779
I dozed off for 5 minutes.

51:11.029 --> 51:12.072
What time is it?

51:12.531 --> 51:13.532
12:05?

51:13.532 --> 51:14.783
That's why I'm so hungry.

51:14.783 --> 51:15.659
I'd eat an ox.

51:16.326 --> 51:17.452
Shall I order a pizza, boss?

51:17.452 --> 51:18.745
I won't refuse, my little Alan.

51:18.745 --> 51:19.246
I'm on it.

51:19.538 --> 51:22.749
Emilién, I had an absurd dream
and you were in it.

51:22.791 --> 51:23.333
Really?

51:23.333 --> 51:25.836
Yes, that Belgian had tricked you

51:25.836 --> 51:27.212
and you let him get away.

51:28.630 --> 51:30.465
It was one of those dreams.

51:35.137 --> 51:35.971
Emilién?

51:56.325 --> 51:57.409
Daniel...

51:58.327 --> 52:00.120
You'll never believe
what happened.

52:00.329 --> 52:01.330
You got fired?

52:01.663 --> 52:02.372
How'd you know?

52:02.414 --> 52:04.458
You get fired once a month.
It's easy to remember.

52:04.458 --> 52:06.084
But this time it's
for real, Daniel.

52:06.084 --> 52:07.628
Do you remember that
public enemy no. 1?

52:07.628 --> 52:09.755
We were supposed to keep
an eye on him during his stay.

52:10.047 --> 52:11.298
- I let him get away.
- No?

52:11.298 --> 52:12.007
I did.

52:12.007 --> 52:13.759
He got away
and I didn't stop him.

52:13.759 --> 52:14.676
I'm such an idiot.

52:14.676 --> 52:16.053
That was quite a stupidity.

52:16.053 --> 52:18.639
It's not just one stupidity,
it's a whole bunch.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.599
I keep stacking them one
on top of the other.

52:20.849 --> 52:23.685
I've made so many of them,
I can write the dictionary of stupidity.

52:23.685 --> 52:24.686
Don't rub it in.

52:24.686 --> 52:25.854
You had your successes.

52:25.854 --> 52:27.064
The Santa Clause gang?

52:27.064 --> 52:27.898
That Chinese woman?

52:28.273 --> 52:29.316
Those were lucky shots.

52:30.734 --> 52:32.152
I'm a good-for-nothing, Daniel.

52:32.236 --> 52:35.364
Gibert did the right thing by
taking away my badge. I don't deserve it.

52:35.364 --> 52:37.032
Don't worry.
You're not the only one.

52:37.199 --> 52:39.618
Besides, I picked this profession
to make my dad happy.

52:39.743 --> 52:41.870
He asked me on his death bed.
How could I refuse?

52:41.870 --> 52:42.663
That's not easy.

52:42.913 --> 52:44.832
But you tried your best
and that's what counts.

52:46.041 --> 52:47.167
Yeah, you're right.

52:48.710 --> 52:50.921
Time to start a new chapter
and do something else.

52:51.129 --> 52:52.381
Something that I care about.

52:52.381 --> 52:54.424
Now that's positive attitude.

52:54.967 --> 52:57.302
Apart from stupidities,
what would you like to do?

52:57.761 --> 53:00.597
That's problem.
I've become attached to this profession.

53:00.806 --> 53:02.850
It's one of the most
beautiful professions.

53:02.975 --> 53:05.769
In that case, you're really
in a dead end.

53:06.436 --> 53:10.399
If only I could find the Belgian,
Gibert would give me back my badge.

53:10.399 --> 53:11.150
What Belgian?

53:11.150 --> 53:12.401
The prisoner was a Belgian.

53:12.401 --> 53:14.111
With a big face,
dressed as a fisherman?

53:14.111 --> 53:14.695
Yeah.

53:16.864 --> 53:18.031
That's exactly him.

53:18.448 --> 53:19.533
Did you see him?

53:19.533 --> 53:21.451
He got in my cab
in front of the station.

53:22.035 --> 53:22.619
That was him.

53:22.619 --> 53:24.454
He didn't want a lift,
preferring a cab.

53:24.413 --> 53:27.958
That was a truly spectacular escape.
Was there also a goodbye fanfare?

53:27.958 --> 53:30.085
Stop it, Daniel.
Do you remember where you drove him?

53:30.085 --> 53:31.044
Of course I remember.

53:31.545 --> 53:32.880
You're a genius, Daniel.

53:35.090 --> 53:35.674
Emilién?

53:35.674 --> 53:36.383
What?

53:36.383 --> 53:37.759
And what about the kids?

53:39.553 --> 53:40.804
Crap.
The kids.

53:41.221 --> 53:42.389
Do you have an idea?

53:45.475 --> 53:46.476
My little Daniel.

53:47.019 --> 53:48.061
Is it already Sunday?

53:48.061 --> 53:49.104
Yes, it's Sunday.

53:49.104 --> 53:51.148
I'll leave the kids
and go get the apple pie.

53:51.982 --> 53:52.858
Very good.

53:52.858 --> 53:54.151
I'll fire up the oven.

54:02.868 --> 54:03.911
Are you sure this is it?

54:03.911 --> 54:05.162
Yes, no. 4.

54:06.163 --> 54:07.956
We have to make sure
they're still here.

54:08.373 --> 54:09.249
They're still here.

54:09.791 --> 54:11.293
How do you know?
The lights are out.

54:11.293 --> 54:13.754
The lights are out because they're
sleeping like everyone else,

54:13.795 --> 54:14.796
except morons.

54:14.838 --> 54:16.089
And the car is
parked up front.

54:18.008 --> 54:19.426
You'd make a good cop,
you know?

54:20.761 --> 54:21.970
Was that a compliment?

54:22.596 --> 54:23.388
Yes.

54:23.222 --> 54:24.723
Don't tell me it
never attracted you.

54:24.723 --> 54:26.767
As a kid, you never played
cops and robbers?

54:26.767 --> 54:29.061
I did. But I was always
part of the other team.

54:29.061 --> 54:29.645
Always.

54:29.645 --> 54:32.731
So if you want my help tomorrow,
I need to get some sleep.

54:32.731 --> 54:34.691
- Is that possible?
- Go ahead. Sleep.

54:34.733 --> 54:35.984
I'll keep an eye on them.

54:48.831 --> 54:49.706
Emilién!

54:53.377 --> 54:55.087
I'm sorry.
I dozed off.

54:55.170 --> 54:58.382
We have coffee, hamburgers,
cheeseburgers, cake.

54:59.216 --> 54:59.925
And yogurt.

54:59.925 --> 55:01.218
You had all
this in the car?

55:01.218 --> 55:02.511
I went out to buy it.

55:02.803 --> 55:03.595
What?

55:04.137 --> 55:05.681
So the house wasn't
being watched?

55:05.681 --> 55:09.268
I was supposed to sleep, and you were
supposed to watch the house.

55:09.268 --> 55:11.228
But you snore so loud
that I can't sleep.

55:11.228 --> 55:12.354
So maybe they ran off.

55:12.437 --> 55:13.981
They didn't run off.
Look.

55:14.106 --> 55:15.691
The car is parked
in the same spot.

55:15.691 --> 55:18.443
Two guys drove up in
a second car an hour ago.

55:18.443 --> 55:19.903
Yeah? Why didn't
you wake me up?

55:19.903 --> 55:21.905
When you're asleep that's
when I get some rest.

55:21.905 --> 55:22.865
In spite of the snoring.

55:22.865 --> 55:23.448
Daniel...

55:24.199 --> 55:24.992
They're leaving.

55:27.452 --> 55:28.495
There's your Belgian.

55:28.579 --> 55:29.413
It's not him.

55:29.413 --> 55:31.206
He didn't have a mustache
and he was younger.

55:31.206 --> 55:32.916
Emilién, he disguised himself.

55:33.667 --> 55:35.335
Look.
That mustache is falling off.

55:36.086 --> 55:36.920
Yes...

55:36.962 --> 55:39.131
Why would he dress up
as an old man when going out?

55:39.173 --> 55:41.383
Maybe because the police
is looking for him.

55:41.383 --> 55:42.467
Oh yeah, of course.

55:43.594 --> 55:45.721
But I've seen that girl
somewhere before.

55:53.270 --> 55:54.313
I've never seen her.

56:17.711 --> 56:18.921
Where are they going?

56:19.046 --> 56:19.838
Guess.

56:24.593 --> 56:26.136
MONACO

56:30.599 --> 56:31.600
Monaco, of course.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.019
One bank per square inch.
This is paradise for him.

56:34.102 --> 56:35.687
It's called a fiscal paradise.

56:35.687 --> 56:36.772
Yeah, tell me about it.

56:36.772 --> 56:38.816
There are plenty of boxes
here we'd like to open.

56:38.816 --> 56:40.359
It would help us in many cases.

56:40.317 --> 56:44.530
Should I ask the Belgian to open a few?
He owes you that for your help.

56:44.655 --> 56:45.697
Stop your nonsense.

56:54.623 --> 56:55.374
There we go.

56:57.167 --> 56:58.210
He's chosen a bank.

57:00.754 --> 57:02.005
BELGIAN ROYAL BANK

57:07.469 --> 57:09.012
Belgian Royal Bank.

57:09.721 --> 57:11.473
Most likely he's homesick.

57:11.557 --> 57:12.724
Will they rob the bank?

57:12.850 --> 57:14.309
They didn't go
to play boules.

57:14.351 --> 57:15.269
I'm calling Gibert.

57:15.394 --> 57:17.855
Don't you want to wait
until you have some proof?

57:18.021 --> 57:20.149
Don't worry.
We'll find the proof later.

57:20.149 --> 57:21.400
Hello, sir?
Emilién speaking.

57:21.400 --> 57:24.027
I have the Belgian.
I mean I've located him.

57:24.153 --> 57:25.571
I know I'm not a cop anymore.

57:25.571 --> 57:29.491
I was taking a walk and I saw him
walk into a bank with his gang.

57:30.117 --> 57:31.577
They didn't go
there to play boules.

57:32.953 --> 57:34.872
It's the Belgian Royal Bank
in Monaco.

57:34.872 --> 57:36.039
Yeah, it's far.

57:36.874 --> 57:39.042
OK, I'll try to
slow them down.

57:40.210 --> 57:41.044
They're coming.

57:41.170 --> 57:42.045
Great.

57:42.129 --> 57:44.423
We've located the Daltons,
and they're sending Rantanplan.

57:44.882 --> 57:46.967
Hello.
How may I help you?

57:46.967 --> 57:49.344
Yes, I've come to
see my son, Edward.

57:49.344 --> 57:50.929
Edward Triboulet?
You're his father?

57:50.929 --> 57:51.513
Yes.

57:51.513 --> 57:53.056
My pleasure.
He'll be happy to see you.

57:53.056 --> 57:54.975
This way please.
Second floor, room 115.

57:54.975 --> 57:56.268
Thank you, young man.

57:57.060 --> 57:57.936
This way.

57:58.145 --> 57:59.396
You're kind, Etienne.

58:01.315 --> 58:02.065
Come in.

58:05.194 --> 58:05.944
Dad?

58:06.528 --> 58:08.822
- Dad has been dead for 4 years, moron.
- Oh, right.

58:08.822 --> 58:10.657
He wouldn't be proud
you changed your name.

58:10.657 --> 58:12.493
You didn't like it, did you?

58:12.701 --> 58:13.702
Fénimore...

58:14.620 --> 58:15.537
You're not in prison?

58:15.996 --> 58:16.914
Not this week.

58:17.039 --> 58:19.333
I treat prison like
a country house.

58:19.333 --> 58:20.667
I go there to relax.

58:27.382 --> 58:28.383
Bring your head closer.

58:29.718 --> 58:31.220
What a stupid hairstyle.

58:31.220 --> 58:32.471
Can't you get
another hairstyle?

58:32.471 --> 58:34.056
Girls don't like hair
combed like that.

58:34.056 --> 58:36.266
They like hair combed
like mine.

58:37.726 --> 58:39.311
I assume you're still single.

58:39.645 --> 58:40.521
Yes.

59:03.460 --> 59:04.837
Delta 1, we're in position.

59:05.587 --> 59:06.839
Roger that, Delta 2.

59:10.050 --> 59:11.510
That girl is going
to join them.

59:12.177 --> 59:13.262
I've seen her before.

59:13.303 --> 59:14.429
I'm sure of that.

59:15.889 --> 59:16.932
I'm entering the bank.

59:16.974 --> 59:18.100
Roger that, Delta 2.

59:18.308 --> 59:19.434
We have you on visual.

59:19.476 --> 59:20.561
Things are heating up.

59:21.103 --> 59:23.397
Maybe I'll go there
and have a discreet look.

59:23.397 --> 59:24.148
No.

59:24.148 --> 59:25.440
You don't know
what discreet is.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.609
We stay in the car
and wait for Rantanplan.

59:31.155 --> 59:31.989
Madame?

59:31.989 --> 59:34.658
I have an appointment with
Mr. Triboulet to open an account.

59:36.368 --> 59:37.911
I'll call him, madam.

59:44.918 --> 59:46.336
Go ahead.
What are you waiting for?

59:47.921 --> 59:48.755
Hello?

59:49.673 --> 59:50.799
A client.

59:50.799 --> 59:51.633
Take care of her.

59:51.633 --> 59:53.468
Don't let my presence
inconvenience you.

59:53.468 --> 59:54.970
Yes, I'm coming.

59:55.179 --> 59:56.013
Right away.

59:57.806 --> 59:59.433
Go and give me
the keys to the safe.

59:59.433 --> 01:00:00.392
I'll take your place.

01:00:01.101 --> 01:00:03.687
I only have the keys
to the empty boxes.

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:07.483
I only open accounts.

01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:09.610
Good, because so do I.

01:00:14.865 --> 01:00:16.783
I'm sorry for the delay, countess.

01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:18.035
Please, this way.

01:00:22.623 --> 01:00:24.541
- Open it.
- Yes sir, Mr. Triboulet.

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:33.759
If you don't mind
the step, countess.

01:00:49.149 --> 01:00:50.234
And we're done.

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:53.028
Your turn, countess.

01:00:58.033 --> 01:01:00.118
Do you have a favorite place
when opening an account?

01:01:01.703 --> 01:01:02.663
That wall there.

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:05.207
On that wall we have number 82.
Alright?

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.042
Perfect.

01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.975
And?
Catch anything?

01:01:22.975 --> 01:01:25.227
I'm looking for the
alarm system cables.

01:01:25.227 --> 01:01:26.562
If I don't turn it off,

01:01:26.562 --> 01:01:29.439
the alarm will go off when
we open a safety box.

01:01:29.857 --> 01:01:31.233
She's really very good.

01:01:32.067 --> 01:01:32.943
That's for sure.

01:01:33.277 --> 01:01:35.904
Bring us something to eat.
I haven't eaten since last night.

01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:37.156
I'll bring us something, boss.

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:43.495
FRIES

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:47.166
What's Gibert doing?

01:01:47.166 --> 01:01:48.917
It doesn't take an hour
to get to Monaco.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.919
- I've taught you some bad habits.
- That's true.

01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:52.379
And what are they doing?

01:01:52.379 --> 01:01:54.047
It doesn't take an hour
to open a box.

01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.507
Maybe they're opening
more than one.

01:01:57.676 --> 01:01:59.303
This is a list of
those we want to open.

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:01.597
This will take some time.
Have a coffee.

01:02:02.055 --> 01:02:02.973
A coffee?

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:21.909
The "La Libre Belgique" newspaper.

01:02:22.326 --> 01:02:23.619
Now this is class.

01:02:23.911 --> 01:02:25.746
In Her Majesty's service.

01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:37.132
I've opened the first box.

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:38.717
Roger, Delta 2.
Carry on.

01:02:52.898 --> 01:02:53.649
What?

01:02:53.857 --> 01:02:55.400
A guy in a suit
and dark glasses

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.777
gets in a van
at 9 in the morning.

01:02:56.777 --> 01:02:57.986
Do you think that's normal?

01:02:57.986 --> 01:03:00.614
Maybe he got back from work
and is changing clothes before going out.

01:03:00.614 --> 01:03:03.700
And he bought fries,
even though he sells them.

01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.661
Maybe those he bought
are better than his own.

01:03:05.661 --> 01:03:07.538
You have an answer
for everything.

01:03:07.538 --> 01:03:09.039
And that's why I'm a cop.

01:03:16.505 --> 01:03:18.924
I have only 5 boxes left.

01:03:18.966 --> 01:03:20.717
Alright Delta 2, wait a moment.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:29.852
Number 107.
I repeat: number 107. 1-0-7.

01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.061
Roger.

01:03:39.194 --> 01:03:40.612
A black diary.
Is that it?

01:03:40.696 --> 01:03:41.572
Confirmed.

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:48.370
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

01:03:48.412 --> 01:03:50.205
- How's it going?
- Only 5 left.

01:03:50.205 --> 01:03:51.999
- Hurry up.
- Of course.

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:57.421
It's me.
How's it going?

01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:59.089
I'm doing what I can, but...

01:03:59.089 --> 01:04:03.093
He has a smaller head than yours,
so the wig keeps falling off.

01:04:03.135 --> 01:04:04.720
Stop fooling around
and get out of there!

01:04:05.220 --> 01:04:06.096
Moron.

01:04:06.138 --> 01:04:09.308
Enough of this.
Put on the mustache and let's go.

01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:11.059
Or else he'll yell
at me again.

01:04:12.561 --> 01:04:15.314
What are they doing?
Have they stopped for breakfast?

01:04:15.355 --> 01:04:16.440
That wouldn't surprise me.

01:04:18.108 --> 01:04:19.651
Look.
There.

01:04:21.153 --> 01:04:22.529
I told you, he'll get away.

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:24.031
- Yes, hello?
- Gibert here.

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:26.533
Boss, he's leaving the bank
disguised as an old man.

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:27.367
Where are you?

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:29.620
The driver left to
ask for directions,

01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.538
but it's not easy,
because the inhabitants

01:04:31.538 --> 01:04:33.248
run away when they see
a police officer.

01:04:33.248 --> 01:04:35.209
And the GPS is broken again.

01:04:35.667 --> 01:04:37.377
It's displaying the wrong town.

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:39.838
Where do I go now?

01:04:39.838 --> 01:04:41.131
You go to the beach.

01:04:41.131 --> 01:04:43.717
Once you get there, you walk
into the sea and swim ahead.

01:04:43.717 --> 01:04:45.010
- Alright.
- Now get lost.

01:04:45.135 --> 01:04:47.971
He left and is going to get away.
He's at the end of the street.

01:04:48.263 --> 01:04:49.515
It's there around that corner.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.977
Emilién, how was that
old man dressed?

01:05:03.529 --> 01:05:04.404
What do we do?

01:05:04.404 --> 01:05:06.114
Nothing. We don't care.
It's not him.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:07.950
I'm not myself!
I'm not myself!

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:09.451
Sure.
And I'm not myself either.

01:05:09.451 --> 01:05:10.828
Load him up.

01:05:10.828 --> 01:05:12.579
You're making a mistake.
I'm not myself.

01:05:12.579 --> 01:05:13.622
Emilién?

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:14.957
Yes, boss?

01:05:14.957 --> 01:05:17.876
We'll meet at the office.
I have a police badge for you.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:18.877
Thank you, boss.

01:05:19.586 --> 01:05:20.504
Did you hear that?

01:05:21.713 --> 01:05:23.382
Wonderful!
And thanks to you, Daniel.

01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:24.883
How will I ever thank you?

01:05:24.883 --> 01:05:25.968
Emilién, something's fishy.

01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:27.261
He simply feels guilty.

01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:29.304
He knows I'm a good cop
and doesn't want to lose me.

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.265
I'm not talking about that,
but about the Belgian.

01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:33.767
They drove up in 2 cars
and 6 people went in with bags.

01:05:33.767 --> 01:05:35.894
Now 2 of them came out with
no bags and left on foot.

01:05:35.894 --> 01:05:37.146
Can you explain that?

01:05:38.063 --> 01:05:38.856
No.

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:41.191
That's not easy.

01:05:41.191 --> 01:05:43.694
And did you notice the old man
wasn't limping the same way?

01:05:43.694 --> 01:05:45.362
I did notice that.

01:05:45.821 --> 01:05:47.614
I thought he must have
fallen down the stairs.

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.324
Old people often
fall down the stairs.

01:05:49.324 --> 01:05:51.368
And I think it's not
the same person.

01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:52.828
Really?

01:05:54.413 --> 01:05:56.456
If that wasn't the Belgian
then where is he?

01:05:57.499 --> 01:05:58.458
There.

01:06:02.713 --> 01:06:03.881
Holy cow...

01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:06.258
I'll take a different route.
That'll be more discreet.

01:06:06.258 --> 01:06:07.259
We'll meet at the house.

01:06:07.259 --> 01:06:07.926
No way.

01:06:07.926 --> 01:06:10.137
We rob together
and get caught together.

01:06:10.179 --> 01:06:12.639
Besides, you won't leave me.
I'm rich and single.

01:06:13.474 --> 01:06:14.600
I'd regret it.

01:06:16.101 --> 01:06:17.728
Dammit.
He didn't let her leave.

01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:18.812
What now?
Do we follow them?

01:06:18.812 --> 01:06:20.147
With this piece of junk?

01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:24.359
What are you waiting for?
Follow them.

01:06:24.359 --> 01:06:26.236
I'll let them get away.
It's more fun this way.

01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:28.363
This isn't the
time for games. Go.

01:06:43.712 --> 01:06:45.214
Why are they going
so slowly?

01:06:45.255 --> 01:06:48.425
It's nice to drive slowly for once.
We can enjoy the scenery.

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:50.302
Driving this slowly
they'll suspect us.

01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:52.846
A taxi cab is less suspicious
than a piece of junk with fries.

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.349
What are they up to?

01:06:55.516 --> 01:06:57.976
In Monaco they prefer
caviar over fries.

01:06:57.976 --> 01:07:01.688
When they saw a car with Belgian plates,
they followed their client.

01:07:01.688 --> 01:07:03.440
I assure you, this isn't
the time for jokes.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.275
I remind you that
I'm up to my neck in trouble.

01:07:05.275 --> 01:07:07.486
You got your badge back.
That's what matters.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.195
Really?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.365
You think Gibert will give me my badge,
when he learns he has the wrong guy?

01:07:12.324 --> 01:07:15.494
My name is Edward Triboulet
and I work for the Belgian Royal Bank.

01:07:15.577 --> 01:07:17.079
And I'm Hercule Poirot.

01:07:17.079 --> 01:07:18.539
Alan, which book is it now?

01:07:19.832 --> 01:07:21.542
- Number 77, boss.
- 77...

01:07:21.834 --> 01:07:23.126
The Seine-et-Marne department.

01:07:23.293 --> 01:07:24.545
A very nice department.

01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:25.712
You'll see.

01:07:26.588 --> 01:07:27.923
It's worth a visit, isn't it?

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.550
Let's try this again.

01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:30.843
First and last name!

01:07:30.676 --> 01:07:33.720
My name is Edward.
Edward Triboulet.

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:37.141
This is leading nowhere, boss.
And we have few books left.

01:07:37.141 --> 01:07:40.978
Don't worry about that.
We have the 22-part encyclopedia.

01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:43.147
But...

01:07:43.313 --> 01:07:45.732
Since he's Belgian I thought

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:49.278
we could use a different method.

01:07:49.319 --> 01:07:50.696
Do you know what I mean?

01:07:50.696 --> 01:07:52.281
Good thinking, my little Alan.

01:07:52.281 --> 01:07:53.282
Everyone get out.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.908
Please!

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:56.827
Don't leave me!

01:07:56.827 --> 01:07:58.036
Please, don't leave me!

01:07:58.036 --> 01:07:59.288
Stay!

01:08:04.585 --> 01:08:08.130
- So you're Belgian?
- Yes, I'm from Brussels.

01:08:14.219 --> 01:08:16.138
Jacques Brel was also Belgian?

01:08:16.138 --> 01:08:18.640
Yes, he was a great man
and a hero.

01:08:19.015 --> 01:08:20.642
Let's listen to the hero.

01:08:37.576 --> 01:08:38.827
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:08:39.995 --> 01:08:41.078
Wonderful.

01:08:41.078 --> 01:08:42.538
Is this better?

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:44.791
Not that.

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:45.417
No.
Mercy.

01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:48.795
No!
Stop it!

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.469
- Not that...
- First and last name!

01:08:55.844 --> 01:08:57.638
Help!
Save me!

01:08:57.930 --> 01:09:00.515
- Damn. He's giving it to him.
- The boss is good at that.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.979
Crap.

01:09:07.481 --> 01:09:09.066
We lost those guys
with the fries.

01:09:12.903 --> 01:09:14.071
We're not going
to the house?

01:09:14.071 --> 01:09:16.490
I have greater ambitions
than that pitiful house.

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.616
Call the Columbian.

01:09:27.876 --> 01:09:28.877
Are you out of prison?

01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:30.170
Yes, I'm calling
to tell you

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.256
that thanks to what I'm holding,
you'll take my place.

01:09:33.215 --> 01:09:33.966
I'm listening.

01:09:34.091 --> 01:09:36.301
BRB. Belgian Royal Bank.
Ring a bell?

01:09:36.301 --> 01:09:36.844
Yes.

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:39.555
The things that were in your box
are not there anymore.

01:09:41.473 --> 01:09:42.140
Hello?

01:09:42.975 --> 01:09:44.560
Did you drown in
your pretty pool?

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:45.477
What do you want?

01:09:45.769 --> 01:09:46.645
Not much.

01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:50.274
You have 10 minutes to get in your yacht
and sail to your shitty country.

01:09:52.734 --> 01:09:53.819
And we're done.

01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:56.363
I got us an estate, my dear.
Tell me what you think.

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:23.140
This is what I love.

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.517
I came here a year ago,
for talks with the Columbian.

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:27.561
And I fell madly in
love with this place.

01:10:31.273 --> 01:10:33.317
But that bastard
wouldn't sell it to me.

01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:37.112
Come, my dear.
I'll take you to paradise.

01:10:42.743 --> 01:10:44.912
Look at this.
Isn't this beautiful?

01:10:44.912 --> 01:10:45.829
Follow me.

01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:58.008
Isn't this paradise?

01:11:11.063 --> 01:11:12.648
This stuff is first class.

01:11:13.232 --> 01:11:15.984
It's not the flour they sell
on the streets of the capital.

01:11:17.069 --> 01:11:19.154
You turned me on
in the bank,

01:11:19.154 --> 01:11:20.656
while opening those boxes.

01:11:20.781 --> 01:11:21.573
Eugene...

01:11:21.573 --> 01:11:23.408
Don't you think
we should slow down?

01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:25.160
We have no time to lose.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.246
We have to hurry,
ever faster.

01:11:27.496 --> 01:11:29.248
We might be dead in an hour.

01:11:29.456 --> 01:11:30.916
We have to make use
of each moment.

01:11:30.999 --> 01:11:33.585
- You're right, Eugene.
- Call me Fénimore.

01:11:33.585 --> 01:11:37.130
Fénimore, allow me to change clothes,
to look more beautiful.

01:11:37.923 --> 01:11:39.132
That's a good idea.

01:11:39.258 --> 01:11:40.259
I'll change too.

01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:42.928
And we'll eat a candlelight dinner
on the patio overlooking the sea.

01:11:42.928 --> 01:11:44.263
Excellent.

01:11:46.473 --> 01:11:47.933
See you soon,

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:49.518
Fénimore.

01:11:54.565 --> 01:11:57.734
Delta 1, you need to come get me,
things are heating up here.

01:11:58.026 --> 01:11:59.695
When will you be here?

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:00.696
Hold on, Delta 2.

01:12:00.737 --> 01:12:02.906
Excuse me, sir.
How long will the repair take?

01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:05.409
Young man...
2 or 3 days.

01:12:06.243 --> 01:12:07.452
Delta 2...

01:12:07.828 --> 01:12:09.163
I'm sending reinforcements.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.459
Emilién, what are you doing?

01:12:14.459 --> 01:12:15.544
I'm calling reinforcements.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:21.550
My little Emilién.
The Belgian admitted everything.

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:22.384
Everything?

01:12:22.467 --> 01:12:24.803
Everything.
We couldn't stop him.

01:12:24.928 --> 01:12:26.555
And since he
became so willing,

01:12:26.555 --> 01:12:28.724
we attributed him
a few other cases.

01:12:28.724 --> 01:12:31.477
He'll get a 1000 years of prison
and won't notice the difference.

01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:33.395
Boss, that's not
the right Belgian.

01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:34.521
What do you mean?

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:35.856
That's his double,
a look-alike.

01:12:35.856 --> 01:12:37.691
The real Belgian left
the bank 5 minutes later.

01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.651
So where's the real Belgian?

01:12:39.651 --> 01:12:43.363
I've followed him to
the Columbian's villa in Cannes.

01:12:43.363 --> 01:12:45.157
The Belgian and
the Columbian together.

01:12:45.157 --> 01:12:46.658
Can you imagine
such a catch?

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.869
General alarm!

01:12:56.084 --> 01:12:57.586
You look sublime, my dear.

01:12:57.586 --> 01:12:58.337
Thank you.

01:12:58.337 --> 01:12:59.963
And you look great in white.

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:00.923
You think so?

01:13:01.548 --> 01:13:02.466
I like white.

01:13:02.841 --> 01:13:03.884
I like white...

01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:05.844
But I prefer champagne.

01:13:11.683 --> 01:13:13.977
- Did you hear those shots?
- I heard only one.

01:13:13.977 --> 01:13:16.814
Trust me. One shot is usually
followed by others.

01:13:16.814 --> 01:13:17.773
What are you doing?

01:13:17.773 --> 01:13:20.317
I'll take up a forward position
and prepare the terrain for Gibert.

01:13:20.317 --> 01:13:21.902
You'd be better off
guarding the rear.

01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:24.947
Don't worry. I'll inspect
the topography of the terrain.

01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:27.241
So that special forces
can penetrate easily.

01:13:27.241 --> 01:13:28.784
Here.
Put this in your ear.

01:13:29.201 --> 01:13:31.161
You'll be able to
monitor me from afar.

01:13:39.044 --> 01:13:40.754
I have a bad
feeling about this.

01:13:42.548 --> 01:13:43.549
To us.

01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:57.271
There's a high fence.

01:13:57.688 --> 01:13:58.981
I'm climbing up a post.

01:13:59.898 --> 01:14:02.401
There's a tree branch
that reaches into the estate.

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:04.319
That's strange.
Such branches are usually sawed.

01:14:04.319 --> 01:14:05.529
But this one isn't.

01:14:05.529 --> 01:14:06.071
Actually...

01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:07.030
It is.

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:14.288
That was a topography class
presented by Emilién.

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:15.205
Let's dance.

01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:34.933
Do you realize what
a couple we'll make?

01:14:34.933 --> 01:14:36.143
Fire and ice.

01:14:36.393 --> 01:14:38.437
My Machiavellism
and your professionalism.

01:14:38.729 --> 01:14:40.898
We'll be the most feared
couple of modern times.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:44.193
I'll be your Clyde
and you'll be my Bonnie.

01:14:45.777 --> 01:14:47.070
Shall we dance or kiss?

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:48.280
We can do both.

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:50.991
Otherwise I'll come to believe
you're a double agent.

01:14:57.831 --> 01:15:00.209
Haven't you learned
to knock when entering?

01:15:00.375 --> 01:15:01.460
I'm sorry, boss.

01:15:01.460 --> 01:15:03.337
But look what
fell out of the sky.

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:05.881
Well, well. It's the little
cop from Marseille.

01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:07.299
That little cop is an inspector.

01:15:07.299 --> 01:15:08.675
I won't let you
get away with this.

01:15:08.675 --> 01:15:10.844
Hands in the air!
You're under arrest!

01:15:12.638 --> 01:15:14.306
You know, you're really stupid.

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:15.933
Barging in here
with your little gun

01:15:15.933 --> 01:15:18.101
and believing you can arrest
the public enemy no. 1.

01:15:18.435 --> 01:15:20.771
The killer of the Flanders.
The monster of Belgium.

01:15:22.439 --> 01:15:23.857
I warn you.
The house is surrounded.

01:15:23.857 --> 01:15:24.900
Really?

01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:25.776
Right.

01:15:26.068 --> 01:15:27.069
Reinforcements.

01:15:27.736 --> 01:15:28.904
An armada.

01:15:29.655 --> 01:15:32.449
I can hear the helicopters
circling the house.

01:15:33.617 --> 01:15:35.702
- They'll be here any moment.
- Very good.

01:15:35.828 --> 01:15:36.870
We'll be waiting for them.

01:15:37.287 --> 01:15:39.206
I'll show you what
we'll welcome them with.

01:15:42.125 --> 01:15:44.503
But first you'll pay
for disturbing my peace!

01:15:44.503 --> 01:15:45.462
Leave him to me.

01:15:45.462 --> 01:15:47.548
I've always dreamed
of killing a cop.

01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:48.841
And I was off
to a good start.

01:15:48.841 --> 01:15:49.341
Fine.

01:15:49.341 --> 01:15:51.969
This will be my engagement
gift for you, my rose.

01:15:51.969 --> 01:15:55.347
No other gift will
make me happier.

01:15:56.098 --> 01:15:57.349
Miss, please listen to me...

01:15:57.349 --> 01:15:59.768
- Mrs.
- Mrs., if you prefer.

01:15:59.768 --> 01:16:02.646
I've never hit a woman
and I practiced judo for 8 years.

01:16:06.859 --> 01:16:08.152
That was a Japanese hold.

01:16:11.363 --> 01:16:13.615
Since you insist,
I'll take this seriously.

01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:16.076
OK.
But open your eyes.

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.661
Don't worry about me.

01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:19.955
But I am worried about you.

01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:23.167
Do we know each other?

01:16:24.001 --> 01:16:25.085
Think harder.

01:16:27.421 --> 01:16:30.048
I don't know that hold,
but that must have hurt.

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:33.385
Reinforcements better come quick
or there won't be much left of him.

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:38.307
Do you like my girlfriend?

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:39.892
She's not my type.

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:44.563
And would you like me more
if I were a blonde?

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:46.356
Petra?

01:16:46.356 --> 01:16:47.733
I was sure that I know her.

01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:49.026
It took you awhile.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:52.946
Finally.

01:16:53.113 --> 01:16:54.948
Gibert and his orchestra.

01:16:57.034 --> 01:16:59.578
Boss, should I check if
the front gate isn't open?

01:16:59.578 --> 01:17:01.538
You might as well use
the door bell.

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:05.083
The success of an operation hinges
on the element of surprise.

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:08.504
And thanks to this catapult system
we will jump over the fence!

01:17:10.130 --> 01:17:11.965
That was the
Swedish corkscrew.

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:13.342
Go on.

01:17:13.425 --> 01:17:14.301
Show him.

01:17:14.384 --> 01:17:15.469
Break his neck.

01:17:15.511 --> 01:17:16.470
Finish him.

01:17:17.012 --> 01:17:18.388
I have a knife
on my right thigh.

01:17:18.388 --> 01:17:20.057
- Take me as a hostage.
- What?

01:17:20.849 --> 01:17:22.392
Turn around and take me.

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:24.228
In front of everyone?

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.271
Take me as a hostage,
you idiot.

01:17:29.274 --> 01:17:30.651
He's holding a knife
on my throat.

01:17:30.692 --> 01:17:31.902
Where did he get the knife?

01:17:31.902 --> 01:17:33.612
I did a whole body
search and found nothing.

01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:35.155
If you move,
I'll slit her throat.

01:17:35.155 --> 01:17:36.156
Nobody move.

01:17:36.198 --> 01:17:37.741
Don't worry, dear.
I'll deal with this.

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:38.408
Stay calm.

01:17:38.534 --> 01:17:39.660
And you, little cop...

01:17:39.827 --> 01:17:42.079
Tell me what you want,
and you'll have it.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:47.501
Boss, are you sure this is safe
without a warm-up?

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:50.337
I'm warm as the breeze, Alan.

01:17:50.587 --> 01:17:54.925
I took part in a trampoline
competition back in 71.

01:17:54.967 --> 01:17:56.885
Exactly.
71 was a long time ago.

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:59.012
Jumping on a trampoline
is like riding a bike.

01:17:59.012 --> 01:18:01.056
You never forget it.
Send the first group.

01:18:14.153 --> 01:18:15.529
Betrayed by technology...

01:18:15.529 --> 01:18:17.573
Alan, go to the truck
and find the problem.

01:18:17.573 --> 01:18:18.323
I'm on it, boss.

01:18:22.536 --> 01:18:23.954
What's your number, boss?

01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:25.706
I have no idea.
I'm in last place.

01:18:25.706 --> 01:18:28.417
Probably a burned-out fuse.
Find it.

01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:31.628
With his weight, I'm not
surprised it doesn't work.

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:32.754
OVERLOAD

01:18:33.255 --> 01:18:34.548
I found the problem, boss.

01:19:04.161 --> 01:19:05.162
We have company.

01:19:05.287 --> 01:19:06.622
What do we do, boss?

01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:09.374
We wage war!

01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:17.799
You want to play?

01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:19.468
You want to catch me?

01:19:19.468 --> 01:19:20.719
Then come and get me!

01:19:30.813 --> 01:19:32.689
I'm glad I stayed in my cab.

01:19:38.487 --> 01:19:40.364
I'm the no. 1 here,
do you hear me?

01:19:40.364 --> 01:19:43.158
And not only of Belgium,
but of the whole world!

01:19:43.242 --> 01:19:45.244
And some French cops
are not going to scare me!

01:19:48.455 --> 01:19:49.206
Let's go!

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:54.002
Come on!
I'll show you!

01:20:07.391 --> 01:20:09.017
Do you know what
this Frenchie says?

01:20:11.436 --> 01:20:14.064
He says you're making him mad!

01:20:15.566 --> 01:20:16.984
And this little Frenchie...

01:20:18.110 --> 01:20:20.320
is going to kick your ass.

01:20:20.863 --> 01:20:22.156
It won't take long.

01:20:41.133 --> 01:20:42.718
Daniel, help us.

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:44.261
I'm not surprised
he remembers me.

01:20:47.723 --> 01:20:49.683
And who's no. 1 now?

01:21:02.488 --> 01:21:05.657
This weapon is dangerous.
I'll go get something bigger.

01:21:06.450 --> 01:21:08.118
- Is he nuts?
- What's he doing?

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:10.204
Guys, look what I found.

01:21:11.788 --> 01:21:13.457
I saw one of these
in a movie.

01:21:13.665 --> 01:21:14.625
Ignition.

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:16.543
This guy should be
locked away.

01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:20.506
I'll clean up this house.
It won't take long.

01:21:43.946 --> 01:21:45.072
Help...

01:22:10.139 --> 01:22:11.515
It looks better in yellow.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.356
My love...

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.525
When I think that
I didn't recognize you

01:22:21.692 --> 01:22:23.193
and that I almost hit you.

01:22:23.277 --> 01:22:26.113
Don't worry.
I would have defended myself.

01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:33.871
Where should I drop you off,
before matters get hot?

01:22:42.671 --> 01:22:43.922
Listen, buddy.

01:22:44.006 --> 01:22:45.674
I won't congratulate you
for that handling.

01:22:45.674 --> 01:22:46.508
Neither will I.

01:22:46.842 --> 01:22:47.968
And I'm not the only one.

01:22:52.264 --> 01:22:55.058
Excuse me, who among you
is the group leader?

01:22:55.058 --> 01:22:56.226
Excuse me.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:22:58.604
Right.

01:23:00.355 --> 01:23:01.815
May I ask what
your rank is?

01:23:01.815 --> 01:23:02.691
Commandant.

01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:03.442
That's it?

01:23:03.692 --> 01:23:06.278
Judging by your look,
I thought you were a General.

01:23:06.612 --> 01:23:09.531
Surely someone doesn't like you
and is putting a spanner in the works.

01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.574
I can take care of that.

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:12.993
I know a few influential people.

01:23:12.993 --> 01:23:16.997
I buy weapons for them,
so they owe me a favor, Commandant.

01:23:17.748 --> 01:23:18.457
Why not.

01:23:18.749 --> 01:23:20.125
Shall we discuss this
in the car?

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:21.668
My pleasure, Commandant.

01:23:22.169 --> 01:23:22.961
Load him up!

01:23:23.629 --> 01:23:24.505
What are you doing?

01:23:24.505 --> 01:23:25.339
Let go of me!

01:23:25.339 --> 01:23:27.424
You're making a mistake!
Do you know who I am?

01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:29.676
Let go of me!
You're making a mistake!

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:38.936
Young man, your behavior is
an example for others.

01:23:38.936 --> 01:23:39.895
Thank you, sir.

01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:42.940
But Emilién deserves the merit.
I only drove the taxi cab.

01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.108
Besides, the meter has been
running since yesterday.

01:23:45.734 --> 01:23:46.944
There's something I don't get.

01:23:46.944 --> 01:23:48.779
You knew he was going
to rob that bank?

01:23:48.779 --> 01:23:49.530
Yes.

01:23:49.530 --> 01:23:52.741
There are hundreds of safety boxes
we can't legally open.

01:23:52.783 --> 01:23:55.911
So we gave the Belgian the green light
and he opened them for us.

01:23:55.911 --> 01:23:58.413
He'll get 200 years of prison
and won't notice the difference.

01:23:58.413 --> 01:23:59.289
Exactly.

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:01.625
How did you know
he would escape?

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:05.045
By transferring him to you,
we were 90% sure he'd escape.

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:06.338
Really?

01:24:07.673 --> 01:24:10.175
So I had my part in the
success of this operation?

01:24:10.259 --> 01:24:12.386
Yes.
You were perfect.

01:24:18.142 --> 01:24:20.394
Any news about Gibert?

01:24:20.727 --> 01:24:24.022
Even a whole box of sleeping pills
hasn't slowed him down.

01:24:23.856 --> 01:24:27.234
We'll show them!
Forward!

01:24:30.279 --> 01:24:31.697
Win the match!

01:24:31.905 --> 01:24:33.699
The Commissionaire is
full of energy.

01:24:33.699 --> 01:24:35.826
We've tried everything
to get him to tire.

01:24:35.826 --> 01:24:39.037
We signed him up for the New York marathon,
but even that didn't help.

01:24:39.413 --> 01:24:41.123
Shoot!
Go on!

01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:47.087
What's he doing?
Is this how he plays?

01:24:52.301 --> 01:24:53.385
Shoot!

01:24:58.223 --> 01:25:00.058
You're not here to
pretend you're playing.

01:25:00.142 --> 01:25:02.227
I'll show you
how to play.

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:17.993
Is this hard to do?

01:25:18.535 --> 01:25:19.495
Look.

01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:21.914
Look at this ball handling.
