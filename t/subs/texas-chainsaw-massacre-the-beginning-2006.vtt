01:39.752 --> 01:43.131
Boss, I need a bathroom break!

01:43.131 --> 01:46.050
Please.

01:55.518 --> 01:57.604
Dear Lord, help me!

02:10.535 --> 02:11.911
Get the hell out of here.

02:16.290 --> 02:21.212
Well, that's what you get for
drinking on the job, Sloane.

02:21.254 --> 02:23.047
Hey, Sloane, take it easy!

02:24.882 --> 02:29.220
Sloane! Sloane! Damn it! Sloane!

02:30.179 --> 02:32.765
You can do it!

02:33.803 --> 02:37.599
Sloane. Sloane.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.908
Uhh...

02:48.493 --> 02:51.580
Dear God help us.

03:46.968 --> 03:49.805
He's so beautiful.

03:51.515 --> 03:53.975
That's the ugliest thing I ever saw.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.942
Don't worry about it, Tommy.

04:43.984 --> 04:48.155
You don't have to look pretty to
work down at the slaughterhouse.

06:55.741 --> 06:59.077
What is that diseased
freak still doing out here?

06:59.119 --> 07:01.329
We closed for good now.

07:01.371 --> 07:03.623
Uh, I think he likes it here, sir.

07:03.665 --> 07:06.835
Ain't no reason for that
ugly beast to still be here.

07:06.877 --> 07:10.338
Jess, we need to get that oversized
retard the hell out of here.

07:11.631 --> 07:13.717
We, sir?

07:13.759 --> 07:15.052
Just you.

07:25.929 --> 07:27.806
Hello, Hewitt.

07:30.559 --> 07:32.269
We're shutting down the place today.

07:32.311 --> 07:33.896
You know that 'cause I done told you.

07:33.937 --> 07:35.939
Shutting down for good.

07:35.939 --> 07:39.151
We ain't packing no more meat.

07:39.234 --> 07:41.612
Ain't killing no more animals so...

07:43.530 --> 07:47.993
You just leave the equipment.
You just get on home now, okay?

07:48.035 --> 07:53.999
You gotta go, I said!

07:54.041 --> 07:56.668
You gotta get the hell out
of here, you dumb animal!

08:34.456 --> 08:35.916
What are you doing?

08:38.626 --> 08:41.964
Shh! Keep your voice down.

08:41.964 --> 08:44.091
This is how you sneak up on 'em,

08:44.133 --> 08:47.094
How you catch 'em. Catch who?

08:48.679 --> 08:51.765
Gooks in the swamp.

08:51.807 --> 08:54.309
Eric, the only thing you're gonna
catch in this water is disease.

08:56.270 --> 08:59.440
Chrissie, come on. No, I'm
not going in that water.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.941
Consider it the last wish of a soldier.

09:00.983 --> 09:02.776
Oh, no.

09:02.818 --> 09:05.738
No, you've been getting last wishes
this whole past week, G.I. Joe.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.991
And you call yourself a patriot.

09:09.032 --> 09:11.118
You know what I think
is patriotic? What?

09:11.160 --> 09:15.539
Me driving you across state
to go to Vietnam. Again.

09:15.539 --> 09:16.832
You goin' all the way to Vietnam, baby?

09:16.874 --> 09:19.001
No, honey, base camp's far
enough for me, trust me.

09:22.004 --> 09:24.089
Just try to relax, baby,

09:24.131 --> 09:27.634
'Cause today I'm going to use my tongue

09:27.634 --> 09:29.720
In ways the Lord never intended.

09:29.762 --> 09:32.806
How's that sound? Okay.

09:41.273 --> 09:43.358
Mmm...

09:56.830 --> 09:59.374
This may come as a shock
to you, but most men

09:59.416 --> 10:01.585
Are into this kind of thing.

10:03.879 --> 10:05.047
I'm sorry.

10:08.050 --> 10:10.302
I'm just a little distracted, Bail.

10:12.888 --> 10:15.224
I mean, I just keep thinking,

10:15.265 --> 10:17.309
How does a person go back there?

10:17.392 --> 10:19.019
You know, how do you do that?

10:19.061 --> 10:22.147
It doesn't make him any more
heroic than you, baby, okay?

10:24.608 --> 10:26.693
Yeah, but he thinks I'm
going with him, Bail.

10:26.735 --> 10:30.948
Eric thinks I'm going
to Vietnam with him.

10:30.989 --> 10:34.701
Well, he's your brother, he loves you.

10:34.743 --> 10:37.788
You know, he'll get over it, okay?

10:41.750 --> 10:43.210
Just close your eyes.

10:43.252 --> 10:46.213
Let me see your hand.

10:46.255 --> 10:48.382
You're gonna love this.

10:48.424 --> 10:49.883
Can I look?

10:49.925 --> 10:51.885
Yeah.

10:53.929 --> 10:56.640
Eric, you got that
from a Cracker Jack box!

10:56.640 --> 10:59.435
Wha... I... I had to eat 17
batches to find the one I wanted.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.314
How many?

11:04.398 --> 11:07.359
Two. Okay, girls or boys?

11:07.401 --> 11:09.945
One of each.

11:10.028 --> 11:11.447
And what are their names?

11:11.488 --> 11:14.992
Bonnie and Clyde. No.

11:15.033 --> 11:17.745
Come on. Bobby and Janis.

11:17.786 --> 11:20.497
And where are us and
the kids gonna live?

11:20.539 --> 11:24.126
California. Right by the water.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.471
Don't leave me.

11:37.097 --> 11:40.225
I ain't never gonna
leave you, beautiful.

11:40.267 --> 11:44.605
I'll give you everything you want, baby.

11:44.646 --> 11:46.440
Starting with this.

11:48.609 --> 11:50.360
This is what you're gonna tell him...

11:50.402 --> 11:53.030
You're going to walk right up to Eric,

11:53.072 --> 11:55.240
And you're gonna tell him
that you're going to Mexico

11:55.282 --> 11:57.659
And you're not gonna join
him in this stupid war,

11:57.701 --> 12:00.120
No matter what some draft card says.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.914
Okay?

12:04.792 --> 12:07.920
Get your bony ass ready,
soldier! Moving out at 1700 hours.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.506
What's 1700 hours?

12:10.547 --> 12:13.133
You better be getting some, Dean.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.112
What the hell are you still doing here?

12:33.153 --> 12:35.030
Go home. We're out of business.

12:35.072 --> 12:36.990
You and your family are
the only ones stupid enough

12:36.990 --> 12:38.283
To still be living in this town.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.494
Your kind belong in this shithole.

12:59.805 --> 13:02.516
Operator.

13:02.558 --> 13:03.892
May I help you?

13:06.804 --> 13:09.098
You're gonna have to
speak more clearly, ma'am.

13:11.309 --> 13:14.562
I don't understand. You're
gonna have to speak more clearly.

13:14.604 --> 13:16.272
I'm your friend, Hewitt.

13:52.433 --> 13:55.228
Come on, y'all. Look alive now.

13:55.270 --> 13:56.980
Take one last look at
that motel over there

13:57.021 --> 13:58.856
'Cause this here's your
lodging for the next two days.

13:58.898 --> 14:00.984
What, are you gonna put
mints on our pillows too?

14:01.025 --> 14:02.902
I'll tuck you in special every night.

14:12.370 --> 14:14.414
We're going on a road trip!

14:36.352 --> 14:37.645
So what are you gonna miss the most?

14:37.687 --> 14:39.147
Hmm? When you're gone,

14:39.188 --> 14:40.815
What are you gonna miss the most?

14:40.857 --> 14:42.442
Fishing for compliments here?

14:42.483 --> 14:43.985
No, never.

14:44.027 --> 14:46.195
She is fishing. I am not.

14:46.237 --> 14:47.488
Come on, tell me.

14:47.530 --> 14:50.241
Besides you?

14:50.283 --> 14:52.118
Nothing.

14:52.160 --> 14:54.329
I mean, family and all, sure,

14:54.370 --> 14:57.040
But Dean's gonna be right there with me.

14:57.081 --> 15:00.126
Right, Deano? Hoo-Ha.

15:34.629 --> 15:38.132
Thomas in there? No, he ain't here.

15:38.174 --> 15:42.887
We got a... we got a
situation on our hands here.

15:42.929 --> 15:45.640
I just came back from
the slaughterhouse.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.559
That 'tarded nephew
of yours killed a man.

15:48.559 --> 15:51.479
Now I'm gonna have to apprehend him.

15:51.521 --> 15:53.564
I thought you might
want to accompany me,

15:53.606 --> 15:56.859
Help finesse the situation, as it were.

16:03.408 --> 16:05.786
Anyway, staying around this town,

16:05.827 --> 16:07.663
There's no more jobs, no more money,

16:07.704 --> 16:10.290
No more food. It's downright suicidal.

16:10.332 --> 16:13.418
And I'm the last bit of
law enforcement that's left.

16:13.460 --> 16:16.213
Hell, I'm moving to Michigan next week.

16:16.255 --> 16:20.842
I often ask myself, "What
makes a man a killer?"

16:20.884 --> 16:24.263
I don't mind saying: You
raised that retard right,

16:24.304 --> 16:26.598
Me and you, we ain't
taking this drive right now.

16:26.598 --> 16:29.560
You can't have a creature
like that around normal folk,

16:29.601 --> 16:33.272
That's what I'm saying. He ain't
retarded. He's misunderstood.

16:34.731 --> 16:37.526
Oh, shit, there he is! Jesus Christ.

16:39.862 --> 16:41.697
You stay put.

16:41.738 --> 16:43.240
I'll let you know when I need you.

16:43.282 --> 16:45.742
Put down the weapon, boy!

16:48.078 --> 16:50.080
I seen what you did back there, Hewitt.

16:50.122 --> 16:54.001
This doesn't have to be
difficult unless'n you make it so.

16:54.001 --> 16:55.752
Just put the weapon down.

16:55.794 --> 16:59.339
Don't be stupid.

17:03.844 --> 17:05.721
I think we've got a problem, Sheriff.

17:15.355 --> 17:19.193
Shit, I just killed the whole
fucking sheriff's department.

17:19.233 --> 17:21.361
Damn, I wondered what that felt like.

18:11.620 --> 18:15.916
You really think you're something
in that outfit, don't you?

18:15.958 --> 18:19.962
Here's your pants.
Supper's on the table.

18:23.840 --> 18:27.553
Ladies love a man in uniform.

18:32.307 --> 18:36.853
That slaughterhouse meant more to this
town than them fools will ever know.

18:36.895 --> 18:39.106
Just a matter of time now

18:39.147 --> 18:42.276
Before this town's overrun
by bikers and hippies.

18:42.498 --> 18:45.560
Us, we're staying right here.

18:45.676 --> 18:49.930
We will never abandon
the place of our birth.

18:51.473 --> 18:54.310
We're on our own now, people.

18:54.351 --> 18:56.520
And alone

18:56.562 --> 18:59.690
We will rise above it all.

18:59.773 --> 19:04.195
People may not remember
what we say here tonight,

19:04.195 --> 19:08.574
But they sure as shit
gonna remember what we do.

19:08.574 --> 19:10.576
Thanks to the good sheriff here,

19:10.576 --> 19:13.287
We ain't gonna go hungry tonight.

19:13.329 --> 19:15.289
Matter of fact,

19:15.331 --> 19:17.750
We ain't never gonna starve again.

19:21.462 --> 19:23.422
Mm-Mm-Mm.

19:25.966 --> 19:29.511
Charlie, say grace.

19:29.553 --> 19:32.097
Mama, I told you Charlie's dead.

19:32.139 --> 19:35.601
It's Hoyt now, Sheriff Hoyt.

20:12.443 --> 20:14.779
Oh baby, look! Come on,
can we stop at that store?

20:14.820 --> 20:16.297
It's just like the one
in California. Please?

20:16.339 --> 20:18.383
Yeah yeah.

20:26.641 --> 20:28.434
Come on, Bail, you'll love this.

20:28.476 --> 20:29.977
These places have tons of character.

20:51.541 --> 20:55.378
Y'all have some beautiful
things in here, ma'am.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.338
Okay...

21:04.137 --> 21:07.390
It'll take you a little while
to get used to things in 'Nam.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.852
The people,

21:10.893 --> 21:14.397
The smells, but...

21:14.439 --> 21:17.567
But what?

21:17.608 --> 21:20.319
You'd be amazed at the
things you can get used to.

21:22.613 --> 21:25.992
Um, is everything
okay with you and Dean?

21:26.034 --> 21:28.202
Uh, what do you mean?

21:28.244 --> 21:32.373
Bailey, come on. You guys have been
exchanging odd glances this whole trip.

21:32.415 --> 21:33.541
Oh...

21:36.336 --> 21:38.671
Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell
me where the bathroom is, please?

21:38.755 --> 21:41.924
Through the back.

21:53.432 --> 21:54.892
Come on, Bailey.

21:54.934 --> 21:56.936
Look, we've been through a lot together.

21:56.978 --> 21:58.271
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

22:00.940 --> 22:03.734
Me and Dean are going to Mexico.

22:03.776 --> 22:05.987
He's not gonna go with Eric.

22:06.028 --> 22:08.531
And uh, he's not going to Vietnam.

22:08.573 --> 22:11.492
Chrissie...

22:11.534 --> 22:15.246
What do you have to say? I say, go.

22:15.288 --> 22:18.291
Get the hell away from this war,
okay? Just cling to what you got.

22:18.332 --> 22:21.460
Then why are you letting Eric go back?

22:21.460 --> 22:24.213
It's just in him. What's in him?

22:24.255 --> 22:26.507
The war. What do you mean?

22:26.549 --> 22:29.885
Look, you do something long enough,
eventually you start to like it.

22:29.927 --> 22:31.345
Hah!

22:34.098 --> 22:35.933
Bitch. Scared the titties right off her.

22:39.061 --> 22:41.564
God damn it.

22:41.606 --> 22:42.940
Broke my mirror.

22:42.940 --> 22:45.943
You think the girls
are gonna be all right

22:45.985 --> 22:48.154
Driving back alone
after they drop us off?

22:48.195 --> 22:51.657
Oh, I'm not worried about them, Dean.

22:57.038 --> 22:58.956
Are you sure you got nothing to tell me?

23:02.585 --> 23:05.421
Can we go?

23:05.463 --> 23:07.131
You all right?

23:07.173 --> 23:10.217
Yeah... let's just go.

23:20.019 --> 23:21.854
You didn't even buy anything, baby.

23:21.896 --> 23:25.942
Yeah, it was... it was nothing
like the one in California.

23:25.983 --> 23:28.945
I guess we'll just have to
go back to that one then.

23:34.700 --> 23:38.287
What are you doing, man?

23:38.329 --> 23:40.581
What the hell are you
doing? I'm not going, Eric.

23:40.623 --> 23:42.250
What do you mean, you're not going?

23:42.291 --> 23:43.668
I'm not going, Eric!

23:46.712 --> 23:49.215
You think I don't
hear you at night, man,

23:49.257 --> 23:52.134
In your sleep, wailing from
what you've done over there?

23:52.176 --> 23:54.178
Now, how could you want that for me?

23:54.220 --> 23:56.472
I'm glad Dad's not here to see this.

23:56.514 --> 23:58.933
What, his son the coward?

24:00.685 --> 24:02.436
Well, guess what,
Eric, I am not like you!

24:02.478 --> 24:04.272
All right?

24:04.313 --> 24:06.023
I am not ready for this
shit! I have no problem

24:06.065 --> 24:08.568
With the Vietcong over
in Vietnam or whatever...

24:08.609 --> 24:10.695
What the hell do you think
I'm going back for, huh?

24:10.736 --> 24:12.863
I'm going back for you! Stop it!

24:15.074 --> 24:16.993
You think you're the only
one who's ever been scared?

24:17.034 --> 24:19.036
You think I wasn't scared?
You think I'm still not scared?

24:19.078 --> 24:20.121
Shut up!

24:21.914 --> 24:23.374
What does she want?

24:25.710 --> 24:27.962
Pull over! Pull over!

24:28.004 --> 24:29.964
Oh God. Jesus Christ, don't pull over!

24:30.006 --> 24:31.424
Shit, she's got a gun, Eric.

24:31.465 --> 24:33.301
Eric!

24:33.301 --> 24:36.387
Shut up! Stay calm.

24:36.429 --> 24:39.015
What are we gonna do?
Eric, she's pulling...

24:41.517 --> 24:43.019
Oh my God!

24:44.353 --> 24:47.523
Look out!

25:04.790 --> 25:06.584
God...

25:09.295 --> 25:11.339
Chrissie.

25:21.098 --> 25:23.893
Buddy, Dean, Deano...

25:23.935 --> 25:27.813
I'm gonna get you help.
I'm gonna find Chrissie.

25:29.815 --> 25:30.942
Chrissie!

25:34.570 --> 25:36.948
Wow, man, I am impressed.

25:36.989 --> 25:39.367
Y'all are tougher than I
thought. What do you want from us?

25:39.408 --> 25:41.035
Oh... everything.

25:41.077 --> 25:45.539
How about we get this robbery
thing out of the way, huh?

26:00.012 --> 26:01.806
Fuck.

26:01.847 --> 26:06.519
You play along, and I won't have to
kill this fucking cop or you. Get up!

26:21.826 --> 26:23.411
I'm glad you're here, officer.

26:23.452 --> 26:25.830
Oh, I just bet you are.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.710
Whoa!

26:35.214 --> 26:36.340
Sir.

26:36.340 --> 26:38.467
You sit down and you stay right there.

26:43.723 --> 26:46.684
You kids okay?

26:46.684 --> 26:49.687
Why don't you step out of
the car, if you don't mind?

26:49.770 --> 26:52.523
He shot her! He shot her! She
can't move, sir. She needs help.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.692
Sir, I can't find my girlfriend.

26:54.775 --> 26:57.403
Get a grip on yourself, son.

26:57.445 --> 27:00.072
Sir, I can't find...

27:00.114 --> 27:03.284
Now, that was for your own good.

27:05.420 --> 27:09.090
Okay, come on kids. Let's
get out of the car now.

27:09.132 --> 27:11.175
Sir, she's... she's really badly hurt.

27:11.217 --> 27:14.053
Right, well okay, kids.

27:14.095 --> 27:17.056
I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time.

27:17.098 --> 27:21.936
Get out of the fuckin' car or I'm
gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

27:23.229 --> 27:27.267
Come on, you can make it. Ooh-Ee!

27:27.308 --> 27:30.019
You kids must have been hauling ass.

27:30.061 --> 27:32.063
Look at the fucking mess you made.

27:32.105 --> 27:35.567
Hey....

27:37.722 --> 27:39.891
There ain't no fire in this accident.

27:39.932 --> 27:42.977
Which one of you assholes
burned his draft card?

27:43.019 --> 27:44.854
Get on over here, boys.

27:46.606 --> 27:49.192
Come on, get over here. No.

27:49.233 --> 27:50.485
God damn it, get over here!

27:56.616 --> 28:00.620
Which one of you boys'
name is Dean Hill?

28:04.082 --> 28:07.335
Honey, you're name ain't Dean, is it?

28:17.011 --> 28:18.679
I am, sir...

28:18.679 --> 28:20.640
I'm Dean.

28:25.353 --> 28:29.649
Well, hey, dean. Good to meet you.

28:29.690 --> 28:32.110
You kids took one

28:32.151 --> 28:35.279
Big, nasty, giant shit

28:35.321 --> 28:38.199
Right in my backyard.

28:38.241 --> 28:42.995
Now we do know that you're
a coward, right, Dean?

28:43.037 --> 28:46.124
I'm gonna to give you
a chance to die a hero.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.338
All right, get her
in there, God damn it.

28:52.338 --> 28:56.676
I'm starting to think you
like wasting my time, blondie.

28:56.717 --> 28:58.261
Hurry up!

29:05.184 --> 29:07.019
I saw Chrissie. You did?

29:07.061 --> 29:08.688
She's okay. Just don't say anything.

29:08.730 --> 29:10.732
Where is she? Shut up.

29:37.425 --> 29:40.511
Hey, Monty, come pick
up this damn wreck.

29:40.553 --> 29:42.930
It's about a quarter mile
south of Hodd's place.

29:42.972 --> 29:45.641
There's a motorcycle too.

29:45.683 --> 29:49.979
Is having a dead biker chick ride
shotgun proper police procedure, sir?

29:51.522 --> 29:54.108
Honey, if that was your mama,

29:54.150 --> 29:58.112
Would you want me to stick her
in the trunk like a dead animal?

29:58.154 --> 29:59.989
I just think this is bullshit.

29:59.989 --> 30:03.451
You got something to say about
this bullshit, do you, Dean?

30:03.493 --> 30:05.078
No, sir.

30:07.038 --> 30:09.582
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Dean?

31:31.748 --> 31:34.375
Where is the gun?

31:47.555 --> 31:50.058
You look through all
this shit on the road?

31:50.099 --> 31:54.187
Is that how we agreed you'd address
me over official FCC airwaves?

31:54.228 --> 31:56.939
No, "Sheriff."

32:30.848 --> 32:32.600
Oh...

32:34.894 --> 32:37.647
Pretty little rascal, ain't you?

33:10.490 --> 33:12.409
And what brings you kids here?

33:14.786 --> 33:16.913
Sir, we were just passing through,

33:16.955 --> 33:19.040
On my way to reenlist, sir.

33:19.293 --> 33:21.012
You look kind of young to me.

33:21.254 --> 33:24.090
Where was you stationed?

33:24.131 --> 33:26.259
Vietnam, sir.

33:26.300 --> 33:30.304
Vietnam. Really?

33:31.764 --> 33:33.558
You kill any commies?

33:33.599 --> 33:36.852
Uh, a handful of gooks, sir.

33:39.939 --> 33:41.107
Where are you taking us?

33:41.148 --> 33:43.651
Where are you taking us, sir?

33:45.069 --> 33:46.696
How was it over there?

33:48.948 --> 33:53.202
Well, it's a... it's
a different culture.

33:53.244 --> 33:56.831
But you'd be amazed at the things
you get used to over there, sir.

33:56.872 --> 33:59.083
You don't say.

34:04.463 --> 34:07.633
This the sheriff station?

34:07.675 --> 34:11.219
No, it's Mama's house.

34:19.478 --> 34:21.688
Oh! Don't even think about it here.

34:28.112 --> 34:29.655
What are we gonna do?

34:29.697 --> 34:32.699
I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.

34:43.377 --> 34:45.045
Hey!

34:45.212 --> 34:49.592
You kids best not be making a mess
in my car or you'll clean it up.

34:50.635 --> 34:53.221
He knows, Eric. What?

34:53.221 --> 34:54.804
He knows you're not me.

34:54.847 --> 34:56.641
No, he doesn't, Dean. Hey, Tommy!

34:56.681 --> 34:58.351
Stay the course. We're out here!

34:58.351 --> 35:01.020
Come on, boy, get over here!

35:01.062 --> 35:03.564
What is that? Get the
lead out of your ass!

35:03.606 --> 35:06.484
Come on, big guy!

35:06.525 --> 35:08.152
What is that?

35:12.657 --> 35:14.116
Go ahead, get her on out of there.

35:34.345 --> 35:35.638
Come on, private!

35:50.861 --> 35:52.738
Oh my God.

35:52.780 --> 35:54.323
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

35:57.243 --> 35:59.495
Dean! Stay with me!

35:59.537 --> 36:01.622
I need you to be a soldier.

36:01.664 --> 36:05.668
People are gonna come
looking for 'em, I know it.

36:05.710 --> 36:07.878
You have made a big mistake!

36:07.920 --> 36:10.214
Boy, are you dumb.

36:10.256 --> 36:12.592
Nobody's gonna miss those
creatures, not one person.

36:12.758 --> 36:15.177
Not now, not when they gone.

36:45.875 --> 36:50.379
Let's see. Anything in here?

36:50.379 --> 36:53.341
A bunch of shit.

37:17.782 --> 37:20.576
Oh...

37:20.660 --> 37:24.455
You little bastard, I know
you've got more in there.

37:45.810 --> 37:49.105
Come on, Tommy, ain't no
different than the slaughterhouse.

37:49.146 --> 37:53.317
Meat's meat, bones bones.

37:53.359 --> 37:55.152
Get it done.

38:00.366 --> 38:03.411
My daddy always told me

38:03.452 --> 38:07.415
That if you want to be a good farmer
you gotta keep your livestock clean.

38:11.252 --> 38:13.879
Clean goat is a happy goat.

38:13.921 --> 38:16.340
What the hell do you want from us, man?

38:16.382 --> 38:18.342
Are you happy yet?

38:43.868 --> 38:45.828
Hey!

38:51.375 --> 38:54.420
H... hey, help us. Help us down, please.

38:58.633 --> 39:02.178
I don't get involved in his affairs. No.

39:27.078 --> 39:29.080
Please, help me.

39:31.666 --> 39:34.335
Please, please.

39:39.140 --> 39:42.268
I didn't know. Didn't know what?

39:44.061 --> 39:46.022
I didn't know you were
going back there for me.

39:46.147 --> 39:49.192
Let's figure out how to
get out of here, Dean.

39:51.486 --> 39:54.530
By God, I'm gonna make
a soldier out of you yet!

39:56.782 --> 39:59.986
No! Please, please!

40:00.128 --> 40:02.714
Are you ashamed of your country, Dean?

40:02.755 --> 40:05.425
No, please! No!

40:08.469 --> 40:10.305
What do you think, soldier?

40:10.346 --> 40:14.517
What would be the proper
punishment for treason?

40:14.559 --> 40:17.103
Just please let him go, sir. No!

40:18.938 --> 40:22.775
I can't make out a word you're
saying, you know it, asshole?

40:22.817 --> 40:24.902
You're killing him, sir! Please!

40:24.944 --> 40:28.323
No no no! Please, sir!

40:29.574 --> 40:33.703
Ain't nothing I hate worse than
a draft-Dodging hippie protester.

40:33.745 --> 40:35.163
I'm Dean!

40:35.246 --> 40:36.956
It was my draft card!

40:37.040 --> 40:39.042
It was my draft card!
It was my draft card!

40:39.083 --> 40:42.170
And you'd just stand
here and let him die.

40:42.211 --> 40:45.173
Sir, could you let him breathe, please?

40:45.214 --> 40:47.717
Please, can you let him breathe?

40:47.759 --> 40:49.969
My apologies. Eric!

40:53.139 --> 40:56.142
Oh shit!

40:56.184 --> 41:00.229
Well, so now you want to
play soldier. Is that it?

41:09.489 --> 41:11.449
Your brother saved your life.

41:11.491 --> 41:15.411
I'm gonna fucking cut your head off.

41:15.453 --> 41:19.040
Yeah, you just keep
sweet-Talking me, dumpling.

41:35.932 --> 41:39.185
Help me!

41:46.943 --> 41:51.155
Back in 1952, Korean War,

41:51.197 --> 41:53.783
Yours truly was a P.O.W.

41:53.825 --> 41:55.952
That's "prisoner of war" for you,

41:55.994 --> 41:57.787
And I know what in the
hell I'm talking about.

41:57.915 --> 42:01.084
Back in those days
there wasn't no rules.

42:01.126 --> 42:04.004
No regulations like there are today.

42:04.087 --> 42:07.666
You got captured, you had two choices:

42:07.766 --> 42:11.312
You starve to death or survive.

42:14.390 --> 42:18.811
Now, you had to eat.
Rations were scarce.

42:18.853 --> 42:22.857
So, well, about once a week

42:22.898 --> 42:26.527
Some poor soul was chosen.

42:28.112 --> 42:30.114
Chosen?

42:34.820 --> 42:37.507
Why are you doing this?

42:37.649 --> 42:40.568
Got to get you cleaned up.

42:40.878 --> 42:42.671
We're gonna have company.

42:42.713 --> 42:46.133
You don't want to look
dirty for company, do you?

42:46.175 --> 42:47.760
Huh?

42:47.760 --> 42:52.639
This is your lucky day!

42:53.306 --> 42:57.143
How would you like to just
stand right up here today

42:57.185 --> 42:59.980
And just walk right on out of here, huh?

42:59.980 --> 43:02.649
I'd like that, Sheriff.

43:02.691 --> 43:07.195
Yeah, well, freedom ain't free.
You know that, right? I tell you what...

43:07.249 --> 43:11.619
10 push-Ups stand
between you and freedom here today.

43:11.760 --> 43:15.973
This shit is what heroes
are made of, you know?

43:16.015 --> 43:18.851
Well, come on, I'm waiting!

43:18.893 --> 43:20.895
Let's get with the program, sunshine!

43:20.936 --> 43:23.355
Come on, you can do it!
Get those push-Ups now!

43:23.397 --> 43:24.940
No!

43:24.982 --> 43:28.152
Shh, now don't cry.

43:28.193 --> 43:29.403
Don't cry.

43:33.657 --> 43:35.534
No.

43:35.576 --> 43:36.744
No!

43:36.785 --> 43:40.247
You shut your cocksucker,
you son of a bitch!

43:41.874 --> 43:44.001
One!

43:44.084 --> 43:47.630
Whoa, that was a really
fine push-Up there. One...

43:50.049 --> 43:51.284
Two...

43:51.326 --> 43:55.538
We've got ourselves a regular
American hero here, ain't we?

43:55.780 --> 43:56.864
Three.

43:56.906 --> 43:58.616
Come on, sweetheart.

44:06.833 --> 44:08.292
Ow!

44:12.922 --> 44:15.424
Eight.

44:17.953 --> 44:19.537
What's it gonna be?

44:19.579 --> 44:22.374
You're gonna be the
motherfucker who eats?

44:22.415 --> 44:25.877
Or are you gonna be the
poor sorry motherfucker

44:25.919 --> 44:27.254
Who gets ate?

44:38.557 --> 44:41.351
Don't give up, Dean!
Show this motherfucker!

44:41.393 --> 44:43.436
Show me that you ain't as fucked up

44:43.478 --> 44:45.981
As the rest of your
useless goddamn generation.

44:45.981 --> 44:47.440
Eight!

44:49.818 --> 44:52.529
Come on! Nine...

44:55.991 --> 44:57.075
Go!

45:00.620 --> 45:03.623
That's only half of one.
That don't count, boy!

45:04.875 --> 45:06.543
Don't give up, Dean!

45:12.091 --> 45:13.425
10. Yeah!

45:14.760 --> 45:15.886
Don't cry.

45:16.929 --> 45:18.097
No!

45:18.138 --> 45:22.434
No. I never had me a little girl.

45:24.269 --> 45:26.480
Got more guts than I
thought you had, boy.

45:26.522 --> 45:29.900
I'm a man of my word. You're free to go.

45:31.610 --> 45:34.321
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

45:34.363 --> 45:37.741
My money says he ain't going nowhere.

45:56.218 --> 45:58.178
Stop!

45:58.178 --> 46:01.432
Please, stop!

46:01.473 --> 46:04.017
Stop!

46:04.184 --> 46:06.437
Please stop!

46:10.232 --> 46:12.651
Look... my friends, they...

46:12.735 --> 46:15.654
They have my friends, okay? They're in
a house over there through the woods. I...

46:17.114 --> 46:21.493
Look, they have your friend.
They took your friend.

46:22.578 --> 46:23.829
I saw you both at the store.

46:23.871 --> 46:27.499
He shot her. The sheriff shot her.

46:35.007 --> 46:36.800
Show me where.

46:45.684 --> 46:49.354
Weather has been so hot lately.

46:49.396 --> 46:52.775
It's important to drink
your liquids, you know?

46:52.816 --> 46:56.403
The body needs to hydrate.

46:58.304 --> 47:01.304
Yeah I see.

47:01.980 --> 47:06.651
I got me some of that breakfast tea...

47:06.762 --> 47:09.125
Jar of ice with plenty of sugar.

47:09.213 --> 47:12.258
Tastes like heaven.

47:19.491 --> 47:21.660
Dean. Dean!

47:51.907 --> 47:55.286
Dean, you did good.
But we gotta hide, okay?

47:56.454 --> 48:00.082
Come on! Come on!

48:05.997 --> 48:08.332
Do you have any idea
where the hell we're going?

48:08.374 --> 48:10.501
Yes, it's...

48:10.543 --> 48:12.920
It's here somewhere.

48:15.298 --> 48:17.175
Sometimes...

48:17.216 --> 48:20.428
I just can't stop eating
them little chocolates.

48:20.470 --> 48:23.514
They're so good.

48:23.598 --> 48:25.099
I put coconut in them.

48:25.141 --> 48:27.560
Oh, sweet Jesus.

48:31.189 --> 48:33.191
Hoyt! Hoyt!

48:33.274 --> 48:36.319
Come here! Hoyt!

48:36.360 --> 48:38.154
Hoyt! Hoyt!

48:39.822 --> 48:42.075
Eric!

48:42.116 --> 48:45.620
He's in here! Eric! Get me out of here!

48:48.790 --> 48:51.417
Shut your mouth! Oh, my!

48:51.459 --> 48:53.795
He's here! He's here! He's here!

48:53.836 --> 48:55.797
Help! Help!

48:55.838 --> 48:58.633
There's keys over there on the counter.

49:02.053 --> 49:04.806
Damn you! A man's home
is his fucking castle!

49:04.847 --> 49:08.184
What the fuck are you
doing in here? Oh no!

49:10.603 --> 49:12.063
Hey!

49:15.983 --> 49:17.985
Find the truck. Go! I'll
get Dean! I'll get Dean!

49:17.985 --> 49:20.279
Unlock the door!

49:23.199 --> 49:28.204
Thomas, Thomas, get up here! I need you!

49:50.601 --> 49:53.271
Come on, Dean, come on.

49:57.358 --> 50:00.194
Hey! Get back here, you skinny bitch!

50:23.426 --> 50:24.761
No!

50:24.802 --> 50:28.514
Come on, we're gonna get out of here.

50:30.349 --> 50:33.102
Dean, go! Go! Come on!

50:33.144 --> 50:35.188
Shoot me, you asshole!

50:35.229 --> 50:39.400
You're not a soldier! You hold
that gun like a fucking girl!

50:39.442 --> 50:40.693
Get out of my way.

50:40.735 --> 50:42.737
You're not a candy-Ass,
are you, Sheriff?

50:42.779 --> 50:45.698
Pull the fucking trigger!

50:46.866 --> 50:49.077
I ain't finished with you yet.

50:52.955 --> 50:57.543
Well... let's just go
see if we caught anything.

51:12.725 --> 51:14.227
Well well well...

51:14.268 --> 51:17.146
It's a good thing you
didn't go to Vietnam.

51:17.188 --> 51:21.943
Something like this might've happened.

51:35.990 --> 51:38.660
You don't like playing with
me anymore because I'm a pussy.

51:38.660 --> 51:40.161
That's what you said.

51:40.161 --> 51:42.622
Well, my nephew Tommy ain't no pussy.

51:42.664 --> 51:45.041
Maybe you want to play
with him for a little while.

52:12.777 --> 52:14.070
That's it.

52:17.740 --> 52:19.075
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

52:19.117 --> 52:21.202
We? I'm gonna get my girlfriend.

52:21.244 --> 52:23.872
No no, look. What about my friends?

52:23.913 --> 52:26.624
What? My friends.

52:26.666 --> 52:28.543
Fuck your friends.

52:28.585 --> 52:30.920
You're on your own.

52:30.962 --> 52:33.006
You asshole!

52:51.691 --> 52:52.650
Shit.

53:33.233 --> 53:37.529
Dean, Dean. Oh fuck. Thank God.

53:38.655 --> 53:39.989
What happened?

53:40.031 --> 53:42.492
Chrissie. Oh, thank
God. Oh, Jesus Christ.

53:42.534 --> 53:45.078
No no no. Don't! I'm sorry.

53:45.120 --> 53:47.789
Just stay still. Okay,
are you okay? You're okay.

53:47.831 --> 53:49.749
They're psycho.

53:49.791 --> 53:52.210
Come on, where's Eric
and Bailey? Come on.

53:52.252 --> 53:55.630
In the house.

53:55.672 --> 53:57.882
You need to go get help, Chrissie.

53:57.966 --> 53:58.967
Okay?

53:59.008 --> 54:01.553
There's no help to go for.

54:04.055 --> 54:08.184
I have to go in there. You're gonna
stay here. I'm gonna come get you, okay?

54:08.226 --> 54:10.061
Okay.

54:11.563 --> 54:14.149
Don't you think you're
gonna go anyplace, huh?

54:24.451 --> 54:26.495
I love you.

55:01.989 --> 55:04.950
No! Come on! You don't... you
don't have to do this, man, please.

55:04.992 --> 55:08.036
No! No. No!

55:09.454 --> 55:11.164
No!

55:13.083 --> 55:15.168
You don't have to do this.

55:16.420 --> 55:18.630
You son of a bitch!

55:23.218 --> 55:24.845
Fuck you!

55:26.680 --> 55:28.890
Fucker.

56:46.176 --> 56:48.220
Huh?

57:59.041 --> 58:00.542
What the fuck...

58:01.835 --> 58:04.588
Oh shit!

58:04.588 --> 58:08.550
Uh, he shot me! Uh! Shut up! Shut up!

58:08.592 --> 58:10.636
Where's the girl?

58:10.719 --> 58:12.638
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Tell me where the girl is.

58:14.264 --> 58:17.559
I'm shot! Shit!

58:17.601 --> 58:21.188
How many times I gotta tell
you not to play with guns?

58:21.229 --> 58:24.107
Oh, Jesus, oh...

58:24.107 --> 58:25.734
Now look what you've done to yourself.

58:25.776 --> 58:29.279
I didn't do it. Stop your
damn whining, Uncle Monty.

58:29.279 --> 58:31.406
Mama, get some towels in here.

58:31.448 --> 58:33.408
Uncle Monty made a mess.

58:33.450 --> 58:35.035
Sheriff.

58:35.077 --> 58:36.870
Who in the hell are you?

58:36.912 --> 58:39.331
What do you want, boy? I want my girl.

58:40.540 --> 58:43.418
Take me to her or I'm
gonna blow your head off.

58:43.460 --> 58:45.045
Okay, all right.

58:46.505 --> 58:48.840
Where is she? Thomas!

58:48.882 --> 58:52.177
Hey! Do not fuck around.
Where is the girl?

58:52.219 --> 58:54.763
Come on.

59:09.695 --> 59:12.072
Help me!

59:13.490 --> 59:15.450
Thomas!

59:21.248 --> 59:22.457
Thomas!

59:22.499 --> 59:24.293
Thomas, where're you at?

01:00:12.883 --> 01:00:15.761
Eric, are you okay?

01:00:15.761 --> 01:00:18.263
What are you doing here?
You gotta get out of here.

01:00:18.305 --> 01:00:21.558
You're... you're gonna be
okay. How bad is it? Tell me.

01:00:24.937 --> 01:00:27.230
No! No! It's all right. I can't feel it.

01:00:27.272 --> 01:00:29.900
I'm gonna get you... it's
okay. Did he cut it off?

01:00:29.942 --> 01:00:31.526
It's okay. I can't feel it.

01:00:31.568 --> 01:00:32.945
No! No!

01:00:38.450 --> 01:00:40.953
I'm cold.

01:00:40.953 --> 01:00:45.165
How... how many?

01:00:45.207 --> 01:00:49.002
Three. Boys or girls?

01:00:49.044 --> 01:00:52.130
All boys.

01:00:52.172 --> 01:00:53.298
What are their names?

01:00:53.340 --> 01:00:58.303
Paul and Christopher...

01:00:58.345 --> 01:00:59.638
And Eric.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:01.765
Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay.

01:01:01.807 --> 01:01:04.476
I promise. I promise, okay?

01:01:05.602 --> 01:01:08.480
Take it easy. There she is.

01:01:10.357 --> 01:01:11.608
Help me.

01:01:11.650 --> 01:01:14.027
That's not her.

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:16.488
Shit, that ain't her.

01:01:16.488 --> 01:01:19.449
You don't want to see the other girl.

01:01:19.491 --> 01:01:20.909
Just shoot him!

01:01:20.951 --> 01:01:23.829
You dumb son of a bitch.

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:31.086
Get him, Tommy, come on!

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:41.046
Damn it! Come on, Tommy.

01:01:41.188 --> 01:01:42.439
This is one of those assholes

01:01:42.481 --> 01:01:44.858
Who used to fuck with you
in the schoolyard, Tommy.

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:49.071
Come on, Tommy, get over
here! Get that thing going!

01:01:49.071 --> 01:01:51.073
Let's go, Tommy! Come on!

01:01:55.786 --> 01:01:58.539
Crank it up! Let's go!

01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:00.457
What it is, asshole!

01:02:00.499 --> 01:02:02.084
Yeah!

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.586
You beautiful bastard, you!

01:02:30.715 --> 01:02:32.759
You fucking asshole!

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.721
You son of a bitch! Comin'
in my fucking house...

01:02:47.648 --> 01:02:49.650
Oh, God.

01:02:49.692 --> 01:02:51.235
You have to get out of here.

01:02:51.277 --> 01:02:53.988
No no no! Get out of here.

01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:56.657
No! Yes, Chrissie, please.

01:02:59.118 --> 01:03:01.120
Hide!

01:03:45.581 --> 01:03:48.501
What are you doing?

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:51.462
Don't. No. What are you...

01:03:57.426 --> 01:03:59.720
No!

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:18.767
Thomas! Tommy.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:22.270
Thomas, quit playing with your
fucking dolls and get up here!

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:31.738
I'm glad you brought your little buddy.

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:34.950
Hmm, I like your new face.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:37.369
Come on, Tommy, get up here.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:56.031
Please! Please!

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:01.453
Help!

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:32.859
Please, please, somebody help!

01:08:32.901 --> 01:08:36.404
Now this will take your
fever down, all right?

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.242
See what you've done?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:45.080
You killed that sheriff and you
started up a whole whirlwind.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.082
Mama, please stop your damn bellyaching.

01:08:50.085 --> 01:08:53.296
Uncle Monty, I love you.

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.508
You know that, and I always do
what's right by you, don't I?

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:58.093
And you trust me, don't you?

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:00.428
Yeah, I trust you. Just do something.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:02.430
Take care of you.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.265
Get in here, boy!

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.393
Uh! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.435
Tommy!

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:14.109
Now, this ain't gonna hurt... Huh?

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:15.944
...much.

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.089
What's that on your face?

01:09:19.531 --> 01:09:21.616
Mama, you get over there
and hold Uncle Monty.

01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:24.703
Why? 'Cause he ain't
gonna like this much,

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.412
That's why.

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.582
No! What the fuck is this?

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.292
Surgery. Come on, Tommy.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.336
No! Oh my God!

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:41.136
Oh, bullshit. Look at that!

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.263
Now, Tommy, that's goddamn sloppy.

01:09:43.305 --> 01:09:45.515
That'll get infected.
Even him up. Come on.

01:09:45.557 --> 01:09:48.350
Huh? What?

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:51.604
Sheriff, no, stop! No!

01:09:56.174 --> 01:09:58.134
There you go. Nice work, Tommy.

01:09:58.176 --> 01:10:00.220
What did you do that for?

01:10:01.387 --> 01:10:03.223
Balance.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.695
I'll get Tommy to wrap this up.

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.615
Please, somebody help.

01:11:34.339 --> 01:11:37.175
Okay. Shh.

01:11:36.275 --> 01:11:38.111
You're gonna be okay, okay?

01:11:38.152 --> 01:11:39.988
Shh shh, I'm sorry.

01:11:42.991 --> 01:11:46.160
It's okay. You're safe.

01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.080
They know you're here.

01:11:53.251 --> 01:11:56.129
I'll have Mama throw on
another plate for supper.

01:11:56.170 --> 01:11:59.215
You... you can stay?

01:12:09.409 --> 01:12:12.871
I think we need a little
more garlic in this one.

01:12:12.913 --> 01:12:15.999
Mama, a little more garlic in this one.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.048
I'll go set the table.

01:12:25.008 --> 01:12:26.968
Oh, shit!

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:30.221
It's okay, Mama. Just
wash it off. It'll be fine.

01:12:30.263 --> 01:12:32.182
Don't step on the fingers.

01:12:32.182 --> 01:12:36.186
What the hell are they
doing on the floor, anyway?

01:12:36.227 --> 01:12:40.023
Good thing you keep a clean house.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.025
I wonder whose tongue this is.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:45.278
That's that fuckin' biker.

01:13:37.664 --> 01:13:41.293
Why are you doing this?

01:13:41.334 --> 01:13:45.922
No talking until after
I've said grace, asshole.

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:00.312
Now...

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:04.691
Let's give thanks for the
bounty that's been given us.

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:07.569
Bow your heads.

01:14:09.112 --> 01:14:11.489
I was hungry and He gave me meat.

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:14.034
I was thirsty and He gave me drink.

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:17.412
I was a stranger and He took me in.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:23.293
This family has endured
through adversity and pain.

01:14:23.376 --> 01:14:27.255
We have endured. Dean.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:29.716
We have prevailed.

01:14:29.758 --> 01:14:32.427
We will never ever go hungry again.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.264
Amen.

01:14:38.725 --> 01:14:40.602
I have a question for you.

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:46.107
One that involves the
family tree, the...

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:49.361
Lineage, if you will,

01:14:49.361 --> 01:14:51.613
So I guess this one's for the table.

01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:55.158
You guys fuck all your cousins

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:56.660
Or just the ones you find attractive?

01:15:00.205 --> 01:15:01.790
You blasphemous bitch!

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:06.253
This is redemption,
lady! That's what this is!

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:09.256
Oh, you're all gonna pay
for your sins. That's right!

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:11.258
And especially you!

01:15:11.299 --> 01:15:15.303
Mama... go take care of Uncle Monty.

01:15:20.267 --> 01:15:21.768
You know what, Mama?

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:24.104
I don't think this
one likes your cooking.

01:15:24.145 --> 01:15:26.690
But who gives a shit?

01:15:26.773 --> 01:15:29.734
She's gonna be sucking
her soup through a straw

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:32.153
For some time to come now, ain't she?

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:35.323
Come on, Monty, take a sip.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:39.327
You gotta have something
to build up your strength.

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:43.290
Please do it.

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:46.960
Just do whatever you're gonna
do, you bunch of degenerates!

01:15:47.002 --> 01:15:50.589
I will not have you
speak ill of this family.

01:15:57.946 --> 01:15:59.656
Come on, now, open your mouth.

01:16:02.034 --> 01:16:05.495
No. No. No.

01:16:21.053 --> 01:16:22.638
Set her free, child.

01:16:25.724 --> 01:16:28.852
No! No!

01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:33.524
No! No! No! No!

01:16:33.565 --> 01:16:35.817
No! No!

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.756
Take that one downstairs!

01:16:39.797 --> 01:16:42.300
No, you stay away from
me, you fucking animal!

01:16:42.342 --> 01:16:44.886
You get the fuck away from me! No!

01:16:44.969 --> 01:16:46.804
Get your hands off me!

01:16:46.846 --> 01:16:48.806
You dirty animal!

01:16:48.848 --> 01:16:51.225
No! Dean! Dean!

01:16:51.267 --> 01:16:54.312
Can't you see? Your friend
ain't with us no more.

01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:58.191
No! No! No!

01:17:02.612 --> 01:17:06.574
Here we go.

01:17:06.616 --> 01:17:10.078
Dean! Help! No!

01:17:10.119 --> 01:17:12.413
No!

01:17:24.008 --> 01:17:25.259
Hey!

01:17:26.302 --> 01:17:28.221
Where in the hell you going, bitch?

01:17:36.646 --> 01:17:38.856
She's gonna tell them all what we done.

01:17:53.955 --> 01:17:57.166
There comes a time when
every boy becomes a man.

01:18:25.194 --> 01:18:28.197
You motherfucker!

01:18:28.197 --> 01:18:31.451
Now we'll see what kind of
soldier you are, Sheriff.

01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:35.997
One!

01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:39.375
That was beautiful form, Sheriff!

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:42.545
Two! Halfway doesn't count, dickhead!

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:46.716
Three! Is that all you got?
Is that all you fucking got?

01:18:46.758 --> 01:18:49.052
Fucker! You killed my girlfriend!

01:18:49.093 --> 01:18:50.887
You fucking asshole!

01:18:50.928 --> 01:18:52.764
Fuck you!

01:18:56.476 --> 01:18:58.686
My money says you're not going anywhere.

01:20:00.915 --> 01:20:02.750
Fuck.

01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:26.459
Fuck.

01:21:56.489 --> 01:21:58.491
Chrissie!

01:25:12.165 --> 01:25:14.876
From 1969 to 1973

01:25:14.918 --> 01:25:19.005
The Hewitt family murdered 33
people across the state of Texas.

01:25:19.047 --> 01:25:23.176
To this day their killing
spree is universally considered

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:26.846
One of the most notorious
and perversely sadistic crimes

01:25:26.888 --> 01:25:29.474
In the annals of American history:

01:25:29.516 --> 01:25:31.935
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
