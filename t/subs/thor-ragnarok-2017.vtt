00:53.800 --> 00:55.520
THOR: Now, I know
what you're thinking.

00:55.680 --> 00:59.040
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage.
How did this happen?"

00:59.240 --> 01:00.960
Well, sometimes
you have to get captured

01:01.040 --> 01:02.720
just to get a straight answer
out of somebody.

01:04.240 --> 01:05.280
It's a long story,

01:05.400 --> 01:07.360
but basically,
I'm a bit of a hero.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.080
See, I spent some time
on Earth...

01:11.560 --> 01:12.720
fought some robots,

01:12.800 --> 01:14.400
saved the planet
a couple of times.

01:14.880 --> 01:16.440
Then I went searching
through the cosmos

01:16.720 --> 01:19.600
for some magic, colorful
Infinity Stone things.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.920
Didn't find any.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.240
That's when I came across

01:24.360 --> 01:27.080
a path of death
and destruction...

01:27.240 --> 01:30.000
which led me all the way here
into this cage...

01:31.600 --> 01:32.920
where I met you.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.240
Hmm.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.760
How much longer do you think
we'll be here?

01:54.880 --> 01:58.440
Thor, son of Odin.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.320
Surtur, son of a bitch.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.440
You're still alive.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.960
I thought my father killed you
a half a million years ago.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.760
I cannot die.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.640
Not until
I fulfill my destiny...

02:11.800 --> 02:14.080
and lay waste to your home.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.760
It's funny
you should mention that.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.240
Because I've been having these
terrible dreams of late.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.640
Asgard up in flames,
falling to ruins.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.960
And you, Surtur,

02:22.080 --> 02:23.600
are at the center
of all of them.

02:23.880 --> 02:27.600
Then you have seen Ragnarok,
the fall of Asgard.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.600
-The great prophecy...
-Hang on.

02:30.080 --> 02:32.480
-Hang on.
-

02:32.520 --> 02:35.280
I'll be back around shortly.

02:35.520 --> 02:38.360
I really feel like we were
connecting there.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.480
Okay, so Ragnarok.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.280
Tell me about that.
Walk me through it.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.440
My time has come.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.720
When my crown is reunited
with the Eternal Flame...

02:49.920 --> 02:52.560
I shall be restored
to my full might.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.000
I will tower
over the mountains...

02:55.160 --> 02:57.720
and bury my sword
deep in Asgard's...

02:58.000 --> 03:00.480
THOR: Oh, hang on.
Give it a second.

03:00.720 --> 03:01.920
I swear I'm not even moving.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.520
It's just doing this
on its own.

03:03.800 --> 03:06.160
-I'm really sorry.
-

03:06.360 --> 03:08.000
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.800
You're going to put your crown
into the Eternal Flame...

03:12.000 --> 03:14.360
and then you'll suddenly grow
as big as a house?

03:14.520 --> 03:15.680
A mountain!

03:15.840 --> 03:18.880
The Eternal Flame that Odin
keeps locked away on Asgard?

03:19.040 --> 03:21.480
Odin is not on Asgard.

03:21.760 --> 03:25.720
And your absence has left
the throne defenseless.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.720
Okay, so where is it?
This crown?

03:27.880 --> 03:30.760
This is my crown,
the source of my power.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.760
Oh, that's a crown.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.680
I thought it was
a big eyebrow.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.000
It's a crown.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.680
Anyway, it sounds like all I
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

03:39.840 --> 03:41.560
is rip that thing
off your head.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.400
But Ragnarok
has already begun.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.400
You cannot stop it.

03:57.080 --> 04:00.200
I am Asgard's doom,
and so are you.

04:00.360 --> 04:03.920
All will suffer,
all will burn.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.800
Oh, that's intense.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.800
To be honest,
seeing you grow really big...

04:07.960 --> 04:10.480
and set fire to a planet
would be quite the spectacle.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.320
But it looks like I'm gonna
have to choose option B...

04:13.520 --> 04:15.240
where I bust
out of these chains...

04:15.440 --> 04:17.160
knock that tiara
off your head,

04:17.240 --> 04:19.240
and stash it away
in Asgard's vault.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

04:22.600 --> 04:23.640
Why fight it?

04:24.040 --> 04:27.520
Because that's what heroes do.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.520
Hmm.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.520
Wait, I'm sorry.
I didn't time that right.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.120
-Hmm?

04:36.360 --> 04:37.640
And, now!

04:42.280 --> 04:45.840
You have made
a grave mistake, Odinson.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.560
I make grave mistakes
all the time.

04:50.560 --> 04:53.280
Everything seems to work out.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.360
Huh?

06:12.040 --> 06:13.680
Heimdall, I know
it's been a while,

06:13.720 --> 06:15.720
but I could really use
a fast exit.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.680
Heimdall?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.560
SKURGE: Heimdall was an idiot.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.680
This job should have
made him rich.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.040
Now, the job ain't easy...

06:26.240 --> 06:28.040
but it does have its benefits.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.560
The Bifrost gives me
access to everything

06:30.680 --> 06:32.560
the Nine Realms has to offer.

06:32.720 --> 06:35.040
I mean it's all mine
for the taking.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.720
Behold...

06:39.920 --> 06:41.080
my stuff.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.400
Ooh.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.080
I'm particularly fond
of these.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.720
I pulled them out of a place
on Midgard called Texas.

06:48.920 --> 06:51.960
I even named them.
Des and Troy.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.200
You see,
when you put them together...

06:56.200 --> 06:57.240
they destroy.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.280
Heimdall, come on.

07:38.600 --> 07:39.640
Stay!

07:41.320 --> 07:44.240
Heimdall?
I'm running short on options.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.960
-Heimdall?
-

07:47.080 --> 07:48.480
Um... Skurge?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.280
Is that important?

08:00.280 --> 08:02.040
SKURGE: You girls
are in for a treat.

08:55.240 --> 08:56.520
Girls!

08:58.080 --> 09:01.840
Well, well, well.
Look who decided to pop in.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.040
Thanks for scaring away
my company

09:04.080 --> 09:05.800
and drenching my workplace
in brains.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.040
Who are you?

09:07.160 --> 09:08.880
Don't you remember?
I'm Skurge.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.080
We fought together
on Vanaheim.

09:10.520 --> 09:12.640
Right. Where is Heimdall?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.800
That traitor. No one knows.
He's a fugitive of the throne.

09:16.440 --> 09:17.560
Traitor?

09:17.880 --> 09:19.240
Yeah. Well, you see,
Odin charged Heimdall

09:19.360 --> 09:20.360
with negligence of duty...

09:20.640 --> 09:22.400
but he disappeared
before the trial.

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
Hard to catch a guy

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
who can see
everything in the universe.

09:24.880 --> 09:25.880
Sure.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.520
Hold on. I'm supposed
to announce your arrival.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.240
What the hell is that?

10:02.280 --> 10:04.920
MAN 1: Oh, brother.
This is it.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.480
I take my leave.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.400
MAN 2: You fool,
you didn't listen!

10:09.640 --> 10:10.640
MAN 1: I'm sorry.

10:10.880 --> 10:11.920
Lady Sif, get help!

10:11.960 --> 10:12.960
Somebody, help!

10:14.040 --> 10:15.280
MAN 1: Sorry
for all I've done.

10:15.560 --> 10:17.240
Shh. It's all right. Hold on.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.800
I'm sorry
I tried to rule Earth.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.280
They'd be lucky to have you.

10:22.640 --> 10:25.280
I'm sorry about that thing
with the Tesseract.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.280
-I just couldn't help myself.
-I know.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.640
I'm a trickster.

10:28.960 --> 10:30.640
So mischievous.

10:31.080 --> 10:33.520
Sorry about that time
I turned you into a frog.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.120
It was a wonderful joke.

10:35.480 --> 10:37.440
'Twas indeed hilarious.

10:37.600 --> 10:39.640
MAN 2: You are the savior
of Asgard.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.960
-Tell my story.
-I will.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.240
Build a statue for me.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.120
We will build
a big statue for you.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.160
With my helmet on,
with the big bendy horns.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.280
I will tell Father
what you did here today.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.120
I didn't do it for him.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.960
I didn't do it for him.

11:05.680 --> 11:07.840
No!

11:11.560 --> 11:14.280
And so,
Loki died of his wounds...

11:14.560 --> 11:16.320
giving his life for ours.

11:16.680 --> 11:19.160
He fought back
those disgusting elves...

11:19.520 --> 11:21.200
he brought peace to the realm.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.640
Loki, my boy...

11:24.400 --> 11:26.080
'twas many moons ago
I found you

11:26.200 --> 11:28.160
on that
frostbitten battlefield.

11:28.960 --> 11:31.360
On that day,
I did not yet see in you...

11:31.680 --> 11:33.840
Asgard's savior. No.

11:34.160 --> 11:38.520
You were merely
a little blue baby icicle...

11:39.400 --> 11:42.520
that melted
this old fool's heart.

11:44.880 --> 11:47.480
Bravo! Bravo!
Well done. Bravo.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.200
Father.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.360
Oh, shit.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.960
Uh, my son, Thor,
has returned!

11:58.320 --> 12:01.360
-Greetings, my boy.
-

12:01.560 --> 12:03.040
It's an interesting play.
What's it called?

12:03.400 --> 12:05.360
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.360
The people wanted
to commemorate him.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.840
THOR: Ah, indeed they should.

12:09.040 --> 12:10.320
I like the statue.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.600
A lot better looking than he
was when he was alive, though.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.600
A little less weaselly,
less greasy, maybe.

12:16.080 --> 12:17.720
Do you know what this is?

12:18.800 --> 12:21.600
The skull of Surtur.
That's a formidable weapon!

12:21.920 --> 12:23.360
Do me a favor.
Lock this away in a vault...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.240
so it doesn't turn
into a giant monster

12:25.360 --> 12:26.760
and destroy the whole planet.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.040
Thank you, dear. Um...

12:30.080 --> 12:32.760
So it's back to Midgard
for you, is it?

12:33.160 --> 12:34.160
Nope.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.240
I've been having this
reoccurring dream lately.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.240
Every night,
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.560
ODIN: That's just
a silly dream...

12:41.800 --> 12:43.640
signs of an overactive
imagination.

12:43.920 --> 12:44.920
THOR: Possibly.

12:45.040 --> 12:46.880
But then I decide to go
out there and investigate.

12:47.240 --> 12:48.280
And what do I find,

12:48.400 --> 12:51.120
but the Nine Realms
completely in chaos.

12:51.440 --> 12:54.280
Enemies of Asgard assembling,
plotting our demise...

12:54.560 --> 12:55.920
all while you, Odin,

12:56.080 --> 12:57.360
the protector
of those Nine Realms...

12:57.600 --> 12:59.200
are sitting here
in your bathrobe,

12:59.280 --> 13:00.280
eating grapes.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.440
Yes, it is best to respect
our neighbors' freedom.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.760
Yes, of course,
the freedom to be massacred.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.680
Yes, besides I've been
rather busy myself.

13:09.960 --> 13:10.960
Watching theater.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.920
Board meetings, and security
council meetings...

13:13.120 --> 13:14.200
You're really gonna
make me do it?

13:14.480 --> 13:15.640
Do what?

13:19.200 --> 13:21.280
You know that
nothing will stop Mjolnir

13:21.440 --> 13:22.920
as it returns to my hand.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.560
Not even your face.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.920
You've gone quite mad.
You'll be executed for this.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.640
Then I'll see you
on the other side, brother.

13:31.320 --> 13:32.440
All right, I yield.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
Behold!

13:44.640 --> 13:45.800
Thor...

13:46.640 --> 13:47.880
-Odinson.
-No.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.960
You had one job. Just the one.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.120
Where's Odin?

13:55.400 --> 13:57.000
You just couldn't stay away,
could you?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.040
Everything was fine
without you.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.880
Asgard was prospering.
You've ruined everything.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.440
-Ask them.
-Where's Father?

14:03.520 --> 14:05.120
-Did you kill him?
-You had what you wanted.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.160
You had the independence
you asked for.

14:06.320 --> 14:07.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:07.520 --> 14:09.600
Okay. I know exactly
where he is.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.880
I swear I left him right here.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.600
THOR: Right here
on the sidewalk,

14:26.720 --> 14:28.000
or right there where the
building is being demolished?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.320
Great planning.

14:29.680 --> 14:30.720
How was I supposed to know?

14:30.880 --> 14:32.040
Can't see into the future.
I'm not a witch.

14:32.680 --> 14:34.440
No? Then why do you dress
like one?

14:34.880 --> 14:36.840
-Hey.
-I can't believe you're alive.

14:37.080 --> 14:38.480
I saw you die.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.200
I mourned you,
I cried for you.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.640
I'm honored.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
GIRL: Ask him.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.680
Hi. Would you mind taking
a picture with us?

14:44.880 --> 14:47.040
-Oh, sure.
-

14:47.080 --> 14:48.680
Start figuring out
where he is.

14:49.640 --> 14:50.680
-GIRL: Oh, my God.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.840
Sorry to hear
that Jane dumped you.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.560
She didn't dump me, you know.

14:55.120 --> 14:56.880
I dumped her.
It was a mutual dumping.

14:59.640 --> 15:00.720
What's this?
What are you doing?

15:01.080 --> 15:02.080
This isn't me.

15:06.800 --> 15:07.840
Loki.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.760
Thor Odinson.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.880
God of Thunder.

15:47.960 --> 15:49.440
You can put down the umbrella.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.280
So, Earth has, uh,
wizards now?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.800
-

16:15.360 --> 16:16.560
The preferred term is

16:16.640 --> 16:18.320
"Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.

16:19.640 --> 16:20.960
All right, wizard.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.360
Who are you?
Why should I care?

16:22.960 --> 16:24.720
My name
is Doctor Stephen Strange,

16:24.800 --> 16:26.760
and I have some questions
for you.

16:26.800 --> 16:27.840
Take a seat.

16:33.000 --> 16:34.000
Tea?

16:36.800 --> 16:37.800
I don't drink tea.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.160
What do you drink?

16:39.600 --> 16:40.680
Not tea.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.760
So, I keep a watch list

16:45.840 --> 16:47.640
of individuals and beings
from other realms...

16:47.960 --> 16:49.520
that may be a threat
to this world.

16:49.600 --> 16:53.200
Your adopted brother, Loki,
is one of those beings.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.840
He's a worthy inclusion. Hmm.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.240
Then why bring him here?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.040
We're looking for my father.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.600
So, if I were to tell you
where Odin was...

17:05.080 --> 17:07.240
all parties concerned would
promptly return to Asgard?

17:07.640 --> 17:08.640
Promptly.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.040
Great! Then I'll help you.

17:10.520 --> 17:12.360
If you knew where he was,
why didn't you call me?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.320
I have to tell you,
he was adamant

17:14.360 --> 17:15.360
that he not be disturbed.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.600
Your father said he had chosen
to remain in exile.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.880
-Hmm.
-And you don't have a phone.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.960
No, I don't have a phone...

17:24.200 --> 17:25.880
but you could have sent
an electronic letter.

17:25.960 --> 17:27.040
It's called an email.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.800
-Yeah, do you have a computer?
-No. What for?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.040
-Uh-huh.
-Anyway,

17:31.080 --> 17:32.720
my father
is no longer in exile.

17:33.000 --> 17:34.560
So if you could
tell me where he is,

17:34.640 --> 17:35.640
I can take him home.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.680
Gladly. He's in Norway.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.840
I'm just seeing
whether this incantation

17:40.880 --> 17:43.880
requires any Asgardian
modifications.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.640
Nope.

17:46.680 --> 17:47.680
Oh, we don't need that.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.840
Will you stop doing that?

17:57.240 --> 18:00.040
I need just one strand
of your hair.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
Let me explain something.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.880
My hair is not to be
meddled with.

18:11.720 --> 18:12.880
We could have just walked.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.440
He's waiting for you.

18:17.760 --> 18:18.840
All right.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.400
Don't forget your umbrella.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.760
Oh, yes.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
Sorry.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.880
There we go.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.880
I suppose I'll need
my brother back.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.680
Oh, yeah. Right.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.240
I have been falling
for 30 minutes!

18:49.240 --> 18:50.400
You can handle him from here.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.120
Yes. Of course.

18:52.280 --> 18:53.600
Thank you very much
for your help.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.800
Good luck.

18:54.920 --> 18:56.880
Handle me? Who are you?

18:57.640 --> 18:58.640
Loki.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.040
LOKI: You think you're
some kind of sorcerer?

19:00.320 --> 19:01.800
Don't think for one minute,
you second-rate...

19:02.160 --> 19:03.120
Bye-bye.

19:28.480 --> 19:29.520
Father?

19:31.320 --> 19:33.840
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.680
Father, it's us.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.560
My sons.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.840
I've been waiting for you.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.680
I know. We've come
to take you home.

19:50.400 --> 19:51.640
Home, yes.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.560
Your mother, she calls me.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
Do you hear it?

20:01.280 --> 20:02.840
Loki, lift your magic.

20:05.480 --> 20:08.000
Took me quite a while
to break free from your spell.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.680
Frigga would have been proud.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.400
Come and sit with me.
I don't have much time.

20:19.360 --> 20:20.840
I know that we failed you.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.320
But we can make this right.

20:23.040 --> 20:24.240
I failed you.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.880
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

20:28.320 --> 20:30.840
No, I've stopped Ragnarok.
I put an end to Surtur.

20:31.600 --> 20:32.600
No.

20:33.240 --> 20:35.200
It has already begun.
She's coming.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.560
My life was all that
held her back.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
But my time has come.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.320
I cannot keep her away
any longer.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.240
Father, who are you
talking about?

20:47.200 --> 20:49.920
Goddess of Death. Hela.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.560
My firstborn.

20:53.760 --> 20:54.760
Your sister.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.520
Your what?

21:02.080 --> 21:04.760
Her violent appetites
grew beyond my control.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.120
I couldn't stop her,
so I imprisoned her.

21:09.240 --> 21:10.280
Locked her away.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.560
She draws her strength
from Asgard...

21:15.920 --> 21:19.400
and once she gets there,
her powers will be limitless.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
Whatever she is,
we can stop her together.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.240
We can face her together.

21:22.440 --> 21:23.440
No, we won't.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.640
I'm on a different path now.

21:26.960 --> 21:28.240
This you must face alone.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.360
I love you, my sons.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.600
Look at that.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.320
Remember this place.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.200
Home.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
Brother.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.640
This was your doing.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.400
So he's gone.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.640
That's a shame. I would've
liked to have seen that.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.560
You must be Hela.

23:30.240 --> 23:31.480
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.120
Really?
You don't look like him.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.280
Perhaps we can come
to an arrangement.

23:37.760 --> 23:39.360
You sound like him.

23:41.440 --> 23:42.400
Kneel.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.920
Beg your pardon?

23:48.400 --> 23:49.760
Kneel.

23:53.280 --> 23:54.880
Before your queen.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.560
I don't think so.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.280
It's not possible.

24:11.440 --> 24:14.960
Darling, you have no idea
what's possible.

24:35.320 --> 24:36.320
Bring us back!

24:36.360 --> 24:37.360
No!

24:46.560 --> 24:47.560
Loki!

25:34.720 --> 25:36.080
Who are you?
What have you done with Thor?

25:41.520 --> 25:42.560
I'm Hela.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.400
I'm just a janitor.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.040
You look like a smart boy
with good survival instincts.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.800
How would you like a job?

28:07.320 --> 28:08.720
Are you a fighter?

28:09.680 --> 28:10.960
Or are you food?

28:11.680 --> 28:13.120
I'm just passing through.

28:13.800 --> 28:15.120
It is food.

28:15.480 --> 28:16.480
On your knees.

28:22.040 --> 28:24.200
-

28:59.200 --> 29:00.560
-He's mine.

29:09.920 --> 29:10.920
Wait!

29:19.960 --> 29:20.960
Wait!

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
He's mine.

29:24.600 --> 29:27.640
So if you want him,
you go through me.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.280
But we've already got him.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.880
All right, then.
I guess I go through you.

29:34.560 --> 29:35.920
-More food.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.600
-Thank you.

30:47.960 --> 30:51.440
Scrapper 142. I need clearance
and an audience with the boss.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.680
I've got something special.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.200
Hey! Where are you taking me?

30:57.680 --> 30:58.840
Answer me!

30:59.200 --> 31:00.320
Hey!

31:00.720 --> 31:03.160
I am Thor, son of Odin.
I need to get back to Asgard.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.360
-Many apologies, your majesty.
-

31:35.120 --> 31:38.680
It's come to my attention
that you don't know who I am.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.360
I am Hela,
Odin's firstborn...

31:49.480 --> 31:51.760
the commander
of the Legions of Asgard...

31:52.040 --> 31:53.680
the rightful heir
to the throne,

31:53.760 --> 31:55.240
and the Goddess of Death.

31:59.920 --> 32:02.400
My father is dead.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.520
As are the princes.
You're welcome.

32:05.240 --> 32:06.600
We were once the seat

32:06.680 --> 32:08.560
of absolute power
in the cosmos.

32:08.880 --> 32:10.920
Our supremacy
was unchallenged.

32:11.200 --> 32:14.160
Yet Odin stopped
at Nine Realms.

32:14.440 --> 32:17.760
Our destiny is to rule over
all others.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.720
And I am here
to restore that power.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.880
Kneel before me...

32:25.000 --> 32:28.960
and rise into the ranks
of my great conquest.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.280
Whoever you are...

32:32.440 --> 32:35.400
whatever you've done,
surrender now!

32:35.720 --> 32:37.800
Or we will show you no mercy.

32:38.080 --> 32:39.440
Whoever I am?

32:39.600 --> 32:42.120
Did you listen
to a word I said?

32:42.480 --> 32:44.280
This is your last warning!

32:46.600 --> 32:48.640
I thought you'd be happy
to see me.

32:54.360 --> 32:55.720
Fine.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.320
SOLDIER: Charge!

34:04.480 --> 34:06.640
Oh, I've missed this.

34:06.720 --> 34:08.400
Still, it's a shame.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.400
Good soldiers dying
for nothing...

34:11.520 --> 34:13.680
all because
they couldn't see the future.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.400
Sad.

34:15.560 --> 34:18.560
-Oh, look, still alive.

34:26.240 --> 34:27.840
Change of heart?

34:28.240 --> 34:30.520
Go back to whatever cave
you crept out of.

34:32.080 --> 34:33.240
You evil demoness!

34:37.280 --> 34:39.240
HELA: Let's go see my palace.

35:10.200 --> 35:12.440
FEMALE ANNOUNCER:
Fear not, for you are found.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.440
You are home,
and there is no going back.

35:19.560 --> 35:21.920
No one leaves this place.

35:22.240 --> 35:23.800
But what is this place?

35:23.960 --> 35:27.080
The answer is Sakaar.

35:29.120 --> 35:31.200
Surrounded
by cosmic gateways...

35:31.440 --> 35:34.120
Sakaar lives on the edge
of the known and unknown.

35:34.480 --> 35:36.080
It is the collection point

35:36.120 --> 35:37.800
for all lost
and unloved things...

35:38.120 --> 35:39.800
like you.

35:39.960 --> 35:42.640
But here on Sakaar,
you are significant.

35:42.960 --> 35:44.320
You are valuable.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.080
Here you are loved.

35:46.160 --> 35:47.160
What the hell?

35:47.280 --> 35:50.320
And no one loves you more
than the Grandmaster.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.520
He is the original,

35:52.640 --> 35:54.640
the first lost
and the first found...

35:54.920 --> 35:56.000
the creator of Sakaar...

35:56.320 --> 35:59.320
and father
of the Contest of Champions.

35:59.680 --> 36:03.840
Where once you were nothing,
now you are something.

36:04.160 --> 36:07.160
You are the property
of the Grandmaster.

36:07.520 --> 36:08.920
Congratulations!

36:09.160 --> 36:12.520
You will meet the Grandmaster
in 5 seconds.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.160
Prepare yourself.

36:16.120 --> 36:17.280
Prepare yourself.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.160
You are now meeting
the Grandmaster.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.520
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.360
He's wonderful.
It is a he?

36:37.680 --> 36:38.880
It is a he.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.960
Yeah.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.120
I love when you come
to visit, 142.

36:42.280 --> 36:43.760
You bring me the best stuff.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.880
Whenever we get
to talking, Topaz,

36:45.960 --> 36:47.680
about Scrapper 142...

36:47.880 --> 36:49.200
what do I always say?

36:49.320 --> 36:51.280
"She is the..."
And it starts with a "B."

36:51.520 --> 36:52.520
Trash.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.200
No, not trash.

36:56.200 --> 36:57.680
Were you waiting
just to call her that?

36:57.720 --> 36:59.120
It doesn't start with a "B."

36:59.400 --> 37:00.400
Booze hag.

37:03.200 --> 37:05.400
Uh, I'm so sorry. No, "best."
I was thinking about "best."

37:05.680 --> 37:06.760
'Cause I always say
you're the best.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.960
She brought me my beloved
champion, you know.

37:09.240 --> 37:10.960
You say that every time
she's here.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
What have you brought today?
Tell me.

37:12.720 --> 37:13.720
A contender.

37:13.920 --> 37:14.880
A what?

37:15.240 --> 37:17.160
I need to go closer.
I want a closer look at this.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.240
Can you take us closer?
Thank you.

37:31.880 --> 37:32.880
Pay this lady.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.640
Just wait a damn minute.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.200
I'm not for sale.

37:43.640 --> 37:45.200
Man, he's a fighter.

37:45.400 --> 37:46.600
I take 10 million.

37:46.920 --> 37:47.920
Tell her she's dreaming.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.920
Oh, for heaven's sakes,
transfer the units.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.560
You'll pay for this.

37:58.960 --> 38:00.120
No, I got paid for this.

38:02.120 --> 38:03.520
-Here's what I wanna know.
-

38:05.280 --> 38:06.280
Who are you?

38:06.400 --> 38:10.360
I am the God of Thunder.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.840
-Wow.

38:13.760 --> 38:14.960
I didn't hear any thunder,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.080
but out of your fingers,
was that sparkles?

38:17.800 --> 38:19.640
We've located your cousin.

38:20.400 --> 38:21.680
Uh, oh, good!

38:21.960 --> 38:23.960
Yeah, come on. I think
you're gonna like this.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.320
There he is.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.480
Hey, cuz.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.320
We almost couldn't find you.
What, you been hiding?

38:29.480 --> 38:30.800
Hi.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.320
-GRANDMASTER: Hmm.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.480
So...

38:33.800 --> 38:34.800
Please.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.000
I'm sorry.

38:37.280 --> 38:38.320
Yeah.

38:38.480 --> 38:39.640
Carlo...

38:40.960 --> 38:42.000
I pardon you.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.560
Oh, thank you.

38:43.640 --> 38:44.640
Thank you.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.840
You're officially pardoned.
From life.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.880
-

38:52.840 --> 38:54.840
Help me.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.160
Oh, my God!

38:58.680 --> 39:00.520
I'm stepping in it.
I'm stepping in it. Look!

39:01.360 --> 39:02.520
Wow.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.480
Oh, the smell.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.040
What does it smell like?

39:06.360 --> 39:08.520
-Burnt toast.
-

39:08.720 --> 39:10.360
What happened to my manners?

39:10.680 --> 39:12.160
I haven't
properly introduced myself.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.200
Come on. Uh, follow me.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.640
-My name is Grandmaster.

39:16.840 --> 39:18.640
I preside over
a little harlequinade

39:18.680 --> 39:20.160
called
the Contest of Champions.

39:20.520 --> 39:21.840
People come from far and wide

39:21.840 --> 39:23.040
to unwillingly
participate in it.

39:23.480 --> 39:24.480
And you, my friend,

39:24.520 --> 39:26.040
might just be part
of the new cast.

39:26.200 --> 39:27.280
What do you say to that?

39:27.360 --> 39:29.360
We're not friends and I don't
give a shit about your games.

39:29.520 --> 39:30.840
I'm going back to Asgard.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.280
-Ass-gard.
-

39:34.040 --> 39:36.040
One, two, three, four.

39:37.720 --> 39:39.840
LOKI: There was a wormhole
in space and time beneath me.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.160
At that moment,
I let go.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.400
Loki?

39:45.880 --> 39:47.480
Loki! Loki!

39:47.720 --> 39:50.920
-Over here. Over here.
-

39:51.240 --> 39:52.400
-Excuse me one second.
-Loki!

39:52.920 --> 39:54.360
-

39:54.400 --> 39:55.560
-What?
-You're alive?

39:55.680 --> 39:57.360
-Yes, of course I'm alive.
-What are you doing here?

39:57.640 --> 39:58.640
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

39:58.720 --> 39:59.720
I'm stuck
in this stupid chair.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.080
-Where's your chair?
-I didn't get a chair.

40:01.480 --> 40:02.720
-Get me out of this one.
-I can't.

40:02.880 --> 40:04.200
-Get me out. What?
-I can't.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
I've made friends
with this man.

40:05.360 --> 40:06.360
He's called the Grandmaster.

40:06.400 --> 40:07.560
-Oh, he's crazy!
-I've gained his favor.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.280
The Bifrost brought me
out here weeks ago.

40:09.560 --> 40:10.560
-Weeks ago?
-Yes.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
I just got here.

40:12.080 --> 40:13.080
What are you
whispering about?

40:14.360 --> 40:15.960
Time works real different
around these parts.

40:16.240 --> 40:19.200
On any other world, I'd be,
like, millions of years old.

40:19.520 --> 40:20.960
But here on Sakaar...

40:26.560 --> 40:29.080
In any case,
you know this, uh...

40:29.120 --> 40:30.520
You call yourself
Lord of Thunder?

40:30.600 --> 40:32.920
God of Thunder.
Tell him.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.840
I've never met this man
in my life.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.600
-He's my brother.
-Adopted.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.760
Is he any kind of a fighter?

40:38.160 --> 40:39.240
You take this thing

40:39.280 --> 40:40.280
out of my neck
and I'll show you.

40:40.560 --> 40:42.120
Now, listen to that.
He's threatening me.

40:42.400 --> 40:44.280
Hey, Sparkles,
here's the deal.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.600
If you wanna get back
to Ass-place, Assberg...

40:46.920 --> 40:47.960
Asgard.

40:48.080 --> 40:50.920
Any contender who defeats
my champion...

40:51.120 --> 40:52.800
their freedom they shall win.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.640
Fine. Then point me
in the direction

40:54.760 --> 40:56.160
of whoever's ass
I have to kick!

40:56.560 --> 40:58.960
That's what I call, contender.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.440
Direction would be
this way, Lord.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.120
Ah! Loki!

41:08.920 --> 41:11.000
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy, man.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.800
-Over here.

41:13.960 --> 41:15.480
The pile of rocks
waving at you. Here.

41:15.760 --> 41:18.200
Yeah, I'm actually a thing.
I'm a being.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.000
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg.

41:20.160 --> 41:21.440
I'm kind of like
the leader in here.

41:21.720 --> 41:23.480
I'm made of rocks,
as you can see.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.000
But don't let that
intimidate you.

41:25.320 --> 41:26.480
You don't need to be afraid

41:26.560 --> 41:28.120
unless you're
made of scissors.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.480
Just a little
rock-paper-scissor

41:29.560 --> 41:30.560
joke for you.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.480
This is my very good friend
over here, Miek.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.360
He's an insect
and has knives for hands.

41:37.160 --> 41:38.440
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

41:38.840 --> 41:41.280
-That I am.
-How'd you end up in here?

41:41.520 --> 41:43.200
Ah, well, I tried to start
a revolution,

41:43.320 --> 41:44.320
but didn't print
enough pamphlets.

41:44.680 --> 41:46.000
So hardly anyone turned up,

41:46.120 --> 41:48.680
except for my mum
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.360
As punishment, I was forced

41:50.400 --> 41:52.800
to be in here
and become a gladiator.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.320
Bit of a promotional disaster,
that one.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.200
But I'm actually organizing
another revolution.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.520
I don't know
if you'd be interested

41:58.600 --> 41:59.640
in something like that.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.360
Do you reckon
you'd be interested?

42:03.680 --> 42:04.680
How did you...

42:04.960 --> 42:07.520
Ah, yeah, no.
This whole thing is a circle.

42:07.800 --> 42:10.880
But not a real circle,
more like a freaky circle.

42:11.200 --> 42:12.360
This doesn't make any sense.

42:12.400 --> 42:13.680
No, nothing makes sense
here, man.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.360
The only thing
that does make sense

42:15.400 --> 42:16.840
is that nothing makes sense.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.360
Has anyone here fought
the Grandmaster's champion?

42:19.680 --> 42:20.680
Doug has.

42:20.840 --> 42:21.840
Doug!

42:22.040 --> 42:23.040
Our luck, Doug's dead.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
That's right.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.360
Everyone who fights

42:25.520 --> 42:26.560
the Grandmaster's champion
perishes.

42:27.040 --> 42:28.560
What about you?
You're made of rocks.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.400
Perishable rock. There you go.
Another one gone.

42:31.720 --> 42:33.440
Yeah, no, I just do
the smaller fights,

42:33.560 --> 42:35.400
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

42:35.680 --> 42:37.280
Wait. You're not gonna
face him, are you?

42:37.560 --> 42:38.880
Yes, I am.

42:39.240 --> 42:40.960
Gonna fight him, win,

42:41.040 --> 42:42.360
and get the hell out
of this place.

42:43.040 --> 42:44.840
That's exactly
what Doug used to say.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.880
See you later, new Doug.

42:56.840 --> 42:58.400
Does no one remember me?

42:59.240 --> 43:01.440
Has no one been taught
our history?

43:07.240 --> 43:08.600
Look at these lies.

43:09.440 --> 43:10.760
Goblets and garden parties?

43:13.160 --> 43:14.720
Peace treaties?

43:15.600 --> 43:16.760
Odin...

43:17.000 --> 43:18.480
proud to have it...

43:18.760 --> 43:20.040
ashamed of how he got it.

43:39.440 --> 43:41.600
We were unstoppable.

43:41.680 --> 43:43.640
I was his weapon
in the conquest

43:43.680 --> 43:46.120
that built Asgard's empire.

43:49.040 --> 43:52.280
One by one,
the realms became ours.

43:52.600 --> 43:56.640
But then, simply because
my ambition outgrew his...

43:56.960 --> 44:01.480
he banished me, caged me,
locked me away like an animal.

44:01.880 --> 44:04.520
Before that, Asgard's warriors
were honored...

44:04.800 --> 44:08.320
their bodies buried as heroes
beneath this very palace.

44:19.600 --> 44:21.280
-Odin's treasures.
-Fake.

44:23.520 --> 44:26.000
Most of the stuff in here
is fake.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.800
Or weak.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.840
Smaller than I thought
it would be.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.520
That's not bad.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.320
But this...

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
The Eternal Flame.

45:07.400 --> 45:09.600
Want to see what true power
really looks like?

45:38.440 --> 45:41.080
Fenris, my darling,
what have they done to you?

45:43.560 --> 45:47.600
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.080
I've missed you.

46:06.040 --> 46:07.800
I've missed you all.

46:10.640 --> 46:11.640
THOR: Odin...

46:11.920 --> 46:15.120
I bid you take your place
in the halls of Valhalla...

46:15.440 --> 46:17.640
where the brave
shall live forever.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.440
Nor shall we mourn
but rejoice...

46:21.840 --> 46:23.120
for those that have died...

46:23.200 --> 46:24.440
THOR AND LOKI:
...the glorious death.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.840
Hurts, doesn't it?

46:34.120 --> 46:35.120
Being lied to.

46:36.200 --> 46:37.560
Being told you're one thing

46:37.640 --> 46:39.480
and then learning
it's all a fiction.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.320
You didn't think I'd really
come and see you, did you?

46:46.640 --> 46:48.280
This place is disgusting.

46:51.280 --> 46:52.960
Does this mean
you don't want my help?

46:53.280 --> 46:55.160
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my
position with the Grandmaster.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.680
It took me time
to win his trust.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.280
He's a lunatic,
but he can be amenable.

46:58.600 --> 46:59.840
What I'm telling you is,

46:59.840 --> 47:01.640
you could join me
at the Grandmaster's side.

47:01.960 --> 47:02.960
Perhaps, in time,

47:03.000 --> 47:06.480
an accident befalls
the Grandmaster, and then...

47:12.480 --> 47:14.880
You're not seriously thinking
of going back, are you?

47:17.520 --> 47:20.040
Our sister destroyed
your hammer

47:20.160 --> 47:21.520
like a piece of glass.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.320
She's stronger than both of
us. She's stronger than you.

47:24.520 --> 47:25.800
You don't stand a chance.

47:25.960 --> 47:28.160
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

47:32.680 --> 47:33.680
Fine.

47:36.360 --> 47:38.840
I guess
I'll just have to go it alone.

47:39.720 --> 47:40.720
Like I've always done.

47:43.880 --> 47:45.040
Would you say something?

47:47.880 --> 47:49.280
Say something!

47:50.520 --> 47:52.640
What would you like me to say?

47:53.080 --> 47:55.200
You faked your own death...

47:55.520 --> 47:58.000
you stole the throne,
stripped Odin of his power...

47:58.200 --> 47:59.720
stranded him on Earth to die,

47:59.760 --> 48:01.360
releasing
the Goddess of Death.

48:02.040 --> 48:03.200
Have I said enough or would
you like me to go back

48:03.280 --> 48:05.200
further than the past
two days?

48:06.880 --> 48:08.320
You know, I haven't seen this

48:08.400 --> 48:10.400
beloved champion
he talks of...

48:10.720 --> 48:12.560
but I've heard
he is astonishingly savage.

48:13.400 --> 48:15.920
I've placed a large wager
against you tomorrow.

48:17.360 --> 48:18.360
Don't let me down.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.760
KORG: Piss off, ghost!

48:26.400 --> 48:27.880
He's freaking gone.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.240
KORG: Oh, yuck!

48:37.400 --> 48:39.520
There's still someone's hair
and blood all over this.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.080
Guys, can you clean up
the weapons

48:41.120 --> 48:42.400
once you finish your fight?

48:42.560 --> 48:43.560
Disgusting slobs.

48:44.760 --> 48:46.200
Oh, Thor...

48:46.720 --> 48:48.520
wanna use a big wooden fork?

48:48.880 --> 48:49.880
No.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.120
Yeah, not really useful.

48:51.400 --> 48:53.120
Unless you're fighting off
three vampires

48:53.120 --> 48:54.760
that were huddled together.

48:55.760 --> 48:57.240
I really wish I had my hammer.

48:57.600 --> 48:58.600
Hammer?

48:58.840 --> 49:00.320
Quite unique.
It was made from this

49:00.440 --> 49:02.400
special metal from the heart
of a dying star.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.440
And when I spun it really,
really fast,

49:04.520 --> 49:06.000
it gave me the ability to fly.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.120
You rode a hammer?

49:07.400 --> 49:08.800
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.440
The hammer rode you
on your back?

49:10.600 --> 49:12.240
No. I used to spin it
really fast,

49:12.280 --> 49:13.920
and it would pull me
off the...

49:13.960 --> 49:16.080
Oh, my God.
A hammer pulled you off?

49:16.120 --> 49:17.920
The ground. It would pull me
off the ground,

49:17.960 --> 49:19.800
up into the air,
and I would fly.

49:20.080 --> 49:21.080
Every time I threw it,

49:21.120 --> 49:22.960
it would always
come back to me.

49:23.280 --> 49:24.480
Sounds like you had
a pretty special

49:24.560 --> 49:25.920
and intimate relationship
with this hammer...

49:25.960 --> 49:27.120
and that losing it

49:27.160 --> 49:28.960
was almost comparable
to losing a loved one.

49:30.120 --> 49:32.160
That's a nice way
of putting it.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.120
I said they're mine.

49:36.640 --> 49:38.560
See her, that's the one
that put me in here.

49:38.880 --> 49:41.120
Oh, yeah. Scrapper 142.

49:41.160 --> 49:43.320
Gotta watch out
for those Asgardians, man.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.000
They are hard to perish.

49:45.160 --> 49:46.560
Asgardian?

49:48.360 --> 49:50.280
Hey. Hey.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.000
Hey.

49:52.360 --> 49:55.000
Do not zap me with that thing.
I just wanna talk.

49:56.760 --> 49:58.120
Asgard is in danger.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.040
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

50:05.160 --> 50:07.360
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie
when I was younger...

50:07.680 --> 50:10.000
until I found out that
you were all women.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
There's nothing wrong
with women, of course.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.240
I love women.

50:12.480 --> 50:13.840
Sometimes a little too much.

50:14.040 --> 50:15.120
Not in a creepy way,

50:15.200 --> 50:16.920
just more
of a respectful appreciation.

50:17.200 --> 50:18.480
I think it's great
that there is

50:18.520 --> 50:21.600
an elite force
of women warriors.

50:21.840 --> 50:23.240
It's about time.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.840
Are you done?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.000
WARDEN: Lord of Thunder,
you're up.

50:27.040 --> 50:28.160
Please, help me.
I need your help.

50:28.200 --> 50:29.200
Bye.

50:29.320 --> 50:31.480
Fine, then you must be
a traitor or a coward.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.040
Because the Valkyrie is sworn
to protect the throne.

50:34.640 --> 50:37.840
Listen closely, your majesty.
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

50:38.400 --> 50:40.040
And I'm a Scrapper,
not a Valkyrie.

50:41.360 --> 50:43.240
-

50:43.360 --> 50:45.200
Bring him in for processing.

50:45.640 --> 50:49.360
And no one escapes this place.
So you're gonna die anyway.

51:01.240 --> 51:02.720
BARBER: Now, don't you move.

51:03.040 --> 51:05.560
My hands ain't as steady
as they used to be.

51:05.840 --> 51:08.640
By Odin's beard,
you shall not cut my hair...

51:09.000 --> 51:11.400
lest you feel the wrath
of the mighty Thor.

51:15.840 --> 51:18.200
Please. Please, kind sir,
do not cut my hair.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.880
Please! No!

51:21.080 --> 51:22.080
No!

51:34.440 --> 51:37.200
Wow! Look at
all of you.

51:37.280 --> 51:38.920
What a show! What a night!

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
Who's having fun?

51:41.120 --> 51:42.920
Please, I'm your host.

51:43.240 --> 51:44.400
Big round of applause

51:44.440 --> 51:46.320
for all of our
undercard competitors...

51:46.600 --> 51:49.280
who today died so gruesomely.

51:49.560 --> 51:50.640
Good sports.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.480
What a show! What a night!

51:53.240 --> 51:56.880
This is what you've come for,
and so have I.

52:02.920 --> 52:05.760
And now,
without further ado...

52:05.800 --> 52:08.280
it's main event time.

52:10.240 --> 52:11.680
Making his first appearance,

52:11.800 --> 52:13.280
though he looks
quite promising...

52:13.800 --> 52:15.480
got a couple of tricks
up his sleeve.

52:15.960 --> 52:18.480
I'll say no more,
see what you think.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.160
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

52:21.320 --> 52:23.480
Lord of Thunder.

52:46.800 --> 52:48.960
Watch out for his fingers.
They make sparks.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.320
Okay, this is it.

52:50.840 --> 52:53.800
Let's get ready to welcome
this guy. Here he comes.

52:54.400 --> 52:56.840
-

53:02.920 --> 53:04.200
GRANDMASTER: He is a creature.

53:04.400 --> 53:05.680
What can we say about him?

53:05.800 --> 53:08.280
Well, he's unique.
There's none like him.

53:08.520 --> 53:10.960
I feel a special connection
with him.

53:12.720 --> 53:13.960
He's undefeated.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.800
He's the reigning.

53:19.200 --> 53:21.280
He's the defending.

53:21.760 --> 53:22.760
Ladies and gentlemen...

53:23.200 --> 53:24.200
I give you...

53:24.520 --> 53:25.520
Uh-oh.

53:29.040 --> 53:32.720
...your Incredible...

53:36.560 --> 53:38.400
Hulk!

53:39.040 --> 53:40.400
Yes!

53:44.360 --> 53:46.200
I have to get off this planet.

53:46.880 --> 53:48.680
Hey, hey, hey.
Where you going?

53:49.040 --> 53:51.240
-

53:57.080 --> 53:58.200
Hey!

53:58.920 --> 54:00.080
We know each other.

54:00.560 --> 54:02.400
He's a friend from work.

54:11.800 --> 54:13.360
Where have you been?

54:13.600 --> 54:15.600
Everybody thought
you were dead.

54:15.880 --> 54:17.640
But so much has happened
since I last saw you.

54:18.240 --> 54:19.800
I lost my hammer.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.920
Like, yesterday,
so that's still pretty fresh.

54:23.520 --> 54:25.640
Loki. Loki's alive.
Can you believe it?

54:25.920 --> 54:26.960
He's up there.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.120
Loki! Look who it is!

54:31.400 --> 54:33.400
Banner, I never thought
I would say this...

54:33.440 --> 54:35.720
but I'm happy to see you.

54:36.080 --> 54:38.400
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

54:44.200 --> 54:45.200
THOR: Banner.

54:46.280 --> 54:47.560
Hey, Banner!

54:48.120 --> 54:50.120
No Banner. Only Hulk.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.680
What are you doing?

54:51.800 --> 54:53.640
-It's me. It's Thor!
-

55:14.160 --> 55:15.320
Banner, we're friends.

55:15.440 --> 55:17.400
This is crazy.
I don't want to hurt you!

55:24.480 --> 55:26.320
-Here we go.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.320
What?

55:56.840 --> 55:58.200
Hey, big guy.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.040
The sun's getting real low.

56:13.360 --> 56:15.720
That's it.
The sun's going down.

56:18.840 --> 56:20.400
I won't hurt you anymore.

56:20.840 --> 56:22.040
No one will.

56:34.240 --> 56:36.240
Yes! That's how it feels!

56:37.840 --> 56:39.400
I'm just a huge fan
of the sport.

56:47.200 --> 56:49.520
All right. Screw it.

56:55.600 --> 56:56.720
AUDIENCE: Oh!

57:01.240 --> 57:02.400
I know
you're in there, Banner.

57:02.400 --> 57:03.440
I'll get you out!

57:12.840 --> 57:14.680
What's the matter with you?
You're embarrassing me!

57:14.920 --> 57:16.080
I told them we were friends!

57:45.920 --> 57:47.360
-

58:47.520 --> 58:50.360
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

58:52.200 --> 58:57.000
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

59:28.640 --> 59:31.240
Another day, another Doug.

59:40.520 --> 59:42.400
HELA: What is that noise?

59:42.720 --> 59:45.360
The common folk aren't exactly
falling in line.

59:45.880 --> 59:49.440
There's a resistance trying
to knock down the front gates.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.760
Tell me about yourself,
Skurge.

59:57.280 --> 59:59.440
Well, me dad was a stonemason.
Me mum was...

59:59.720 --> 1:00:01.600
Right, yeah,
I'll just stop you there.

1:00:01.720 --> 1:00:03.440
What I meant was...

1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:05.280
what's your ambition?

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:09.760
I just want a chance
to prove myself.

1:00:10.560 --> 1:00:11.560
Recognition.

1:00:11.960 --> 1:00:13.200
When I was young...

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:17.120
every great king
had an executioner.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:19.280
Not just to execute people...

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:22.080
but also
to execute their vision.

1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:25.880
But mainly to execute people.

1:00:26.120 --> 1:00:28.080
Still, it was a great honor.

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.640
I was Odin's executioner.

1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:37.960
And you shall be
my executioner.

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.480
Let's begin our conquest.

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.440
Skurge, where's the sword?

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:07.520
That sword is the key
to opening the Bifrost.

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:09.520
Those people you mentioned,

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.640
the ones who aren't
falling into line...

1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:13.360
round them up.

1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:38.680
Excuse me.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.200
Sorry about that.

1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:53.600
These bloody things
are everywhere.

1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:56.040
Come on.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:32.600
You'll be safe here.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:54.240
-

1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:43.120
Are we cool?

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.400
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

1:03:49.880 --> 1:03:51.280
So how long
have you been like that?

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:53.000
Like what?

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:56.880
Like this. Big, and green,
and stupid.

1:03:58.280 --> 1:04:00.160
Hulk always Hulk.

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.360
How'd you get here?

1:04:07.320 --> 1:04:08.320
Winning.

1:04:08.360 --> 1:04:09.960
You mean cheating, huh?

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:12.360
Were they wearing one of these
when you won?

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:13.800
How'd you arrive here?

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:17.800
Quinjet.

1:04:18.200 --> 1:04:20.520
Yes. Now,
where is the Quinjet now?

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:27.360
That's naked.

1:04:27.600 --> 1:04:30.200
-He's very naked. Hmm.
-

1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:35.040
It's in my brain now.

1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:36.880
Quinjet.

1:04:47.760 --> 1:04:48.880
Yes!

1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:50.520
I'm getting us out of here.

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:53.120
This is a terrible,
awful place.

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:57.040
You're gonna love Asgard.
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:58.560
Hulk stay.

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:02.080
No, no, no. My people need me
to get back to Asgard.

1:05:02.960 --> 1:05:04.640
We must prevent Ragnarok.

1:05:04.960 --> 1:05:06.080
Ragnarok?

1:05:06.480 --> 1:05:07.920
The prophesied death
of my home world.

1:05:08.040 --> 1:05:09.360
The end of days,
it's the end of...

1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:13.760
If you help me
get back to Asgard...

1:05:14.040 --> 1:05:15.960
I can help you
get back to Earth. Huh?

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:17.240
Earth hate Hulk.

1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:18.920
Earth loves Hulk.
They love you.

1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:20.520
You're one of the Avengers.

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:21.760
One of the team,
one of our friends.

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:24.240
This is what friends do.
They support each other.

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:25.600
You're Banner's friend.

1:05:25.920 --> 1:05:27.920
I'm not Banner's friend.
I prefer you.

1:05:28.240 --> 1:05:29.280
Banner's friend.

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.400
-I don't even like Banner.
-

1:05:30.520 --> 1:05:33.280
"I'm into numbers and science
and stuff."

1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:35.280
Thor go. Hulk stay.

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:36.680
Fine.

1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:38.280
Stay here.

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:41.440
Stupid place.
It's hideous, by the way.

1:05:41.760 --> 1:05:45.120
The red, the white.
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:47.120
Smash you.

1:05:47.440 --> 1:05:49.600
You didn't smash anything.
I won that fight.

1:05:49.920 --> 1:05:51.920
-I smashed you.
-Yeah, sure, sure.

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:53.800
-Baby arms.
-What?

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:55.280
Baby.

1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:56.800
Moron! You big child.

1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:58.120
Thor go!

1:05:58.240 --> 1:05:59.960
-I am going.
-

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:02.120
-

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:05.360
Thor go again.

1:06:10.240 --> 1:06:11.440
Thor home.

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:22.960
Hulk trains.

1:06:23.440 --> 1:06:25.280
That's great. Have fun.

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:27.160
-Hey, big guy.
-Angry girl.

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:28.480
What have you been up to?

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:29.840
HULK: Winning.

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:43.360
Heimdall, I know
you can see me.

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:46.520
I need you to help me.

1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:50.000
Help me see.

1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:02.840
I see you,
but you're far away.

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:04.960
What's going on here?

1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:06.600
Come see for yourself.

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:10.800
I'm providing refuge
in a stronghold

1:07:10.880 --> 1:07:11.880
built by our ancestors.

1:07:12.360 --> 1:07:15.680
But if the garrison falls,
our only escape is Bifrost.

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:17.880
You're talking
about evacuating Asgard?

1:07:21.040 --> 1:07:22.960
We won't last long if we stay.

1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:24.960
She draws her power
from Asgard

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:26.160
and grows stronger every day.

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:27.440
Come on.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:32.880
Hela is ravenous.

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:34.240
If I let her leave,

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:36.040
she'll consume Nine Realms
and all the cosmos.

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:37.400
We need you.

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:38.560
I'm working on it.
But I don't even know

1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:39.680
where the hell I am.

1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:42.240
You're on a planet surrounded
by doorways. Go through one.

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:44.360
-Which one?
-The big one.

1:08:13.440 --> 1:08:14.600
Thor sad.

1:08:15.040 --> 1:08:16.080
Shut up.

1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:19.920
Thor sad.

1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:22.840
I'm not sad, you idiot.

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:24.920
-I'm pissed off!
-Oh.

1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.600
Angry. I lost my father.

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:32.280
-I lost my hammer.
-

1:08:32.440 --> 1:08:34.040
-You're not even listening.
-Whining and crying.

1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:35.280
Cry like baby.

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.120
Don't kick stuff.

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:40.640
You're being
a really bad friend.

1:08:40.920 --> 1:08:41.920
You bad friend!

1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:43.320
-You know what we call you?
-No.

1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:45.240
We call you
the stupid Avenger.

1:08:50.240 --> 1:08:51.240
What, are you crazy?

1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:52.480
Yes.

1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.960
You know what?
Earth does hate you.

1:09:15.840 --> 1:09:17.760
No. Mmm-mmm.

1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:22.840
I'm sorry I said those things.

1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:24.960
You're not the stupid Avenger.

1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.080
Nobody calls you
the stupid Avenger.

1:09:27.920 --> 1:09:29.160
It's okay.

1:09:29.560 --> 1:09:30.560
You just can't go around
throwing shields

1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:31.800
at people.
Could have killed me.

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:33.080
I know. I'm sorry.

1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:34.840
I just get so angry
all the time.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.960
Hulk always, always angry.

1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:39.520
I know.
We're the same, you and I.

1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:41.560
We're just
a couple of hot-headed fools.

1:09:41.920 --> 1:09:45.640
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire,
Thor like water.

1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:48.360
We're kind of both like fire.

1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:50.520
But Hulk like real fire.

1:09:51.680 --> 1:09:53.960
Hulk like raging fire.

1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:56.320
Thor like smoldering fire.

1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:00.720
Hulk, I need you
to do something for me.

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:01.880
Hmm?

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:08.720
Angry girl.

1:10:16.200 --> 1:10:18.320
What's going on?
What are you...

1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:29.240
You're so thick-headed
that you can't tell...

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:30.840
when someone's hiding
all the way across

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:32.240
the universe and wants
to be left alone.

1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:35.040
-We need to talk.
-No, you wanna talk to me.

1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:36.920
I need her to stay.

1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:38.080
Stay?

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:39.760
Block.

1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:43.160
Stay.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:44.800
-Please.
-Please.

1:10:47.600 --> 1:10:48.560
All right.

1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:52.640
-Here's the deal.
-

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:54.920
I'll listen to you...

1:10:55.760 --> 1:10:56.960
till this is empty.

1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:00.760
Asgard is in danger and
people are dying.

1:11:01.040 --> 1:11:02.440
We need to get back there.
I need your help.

1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:03.920
Wow.

1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:06.440
-Finished. Bye.
-

1:11:08.240 --> 1:11:09.440
Odin is dead.

1:11:12.960 --> 1:11:15.080
Hela, the Goddess of Death,
has invaded Asgard.

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.440
If Hela's back,
then Asgard's already lost.

1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:20.000
I'm going to stop her.

1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:22.000
-Alone?
-Nope.

1:11:22.280 --> 1:11:23.440
I'm putting together a team.

1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:26.440
It's me, you, and the big guy.

1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:29.000
No. No team. Only Hulk.

1:11:29.280 --> 1:11:30.800
It's me and you.

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:32.120
I think it's only you.

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:34.560
Wait. Just listen.
The Valkyrie are legend.

1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:37.000
Elite warriors of Asgard
sworn to defend the throne.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000
I'm not getting dragged into

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:40.120
another one of Odin's
family squabbles.

1:11:40.840 --> 1:11:42.480
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your sister.

1:11:42.800 --> 1:11:44.600
Her power comes from Asgard,
same as yours.

1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:45.960
When it grew
beyond Odin's control

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:47.280
she massacred everyone
in the palace...

1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:48.840
and tried to seize the throne.

1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:50.840
When she tried
to escape her banishment...

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.280
he sent the Valkyrie in
to fight her back.

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:56.840
I only survived because...

1:11:58.600 --> 1:12:00.000
Look, I already faced her once

1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:01.840
back when I believed
in the throne...

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:03.160
and it cost me everything.

1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:05.000
That's what's wrong
with Asgard.

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:07.480
The throne, the secrets,
the whole golden sham.

1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:09.000
I agree.

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:11.320
Don't get familiar.

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.160
I agree.

1:12:13.520 --> 1:12:14.840
That's why I turned down
the throne.

1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:17.000
But this isn't
about the crown.

1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:18.160
This is about the people.

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.280
They're dying
and they're your people, too.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:21.880
Forget it.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.320
I have.

1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:25.640
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:26.960
-Good. Great.
-Great.

1:12:27.200 --> 1:12:28.160
Thank you.

1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:29.840
-For what?
-For this.

1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:33.360
Didn't see that,
did you?

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:36.960
-There... That's better.

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:40.520
You know, go ahead.

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:45.200
Stay here and enslave people
for that lunatic.

1:12:45.520 --> 1:12:46.720
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.160
But me...

1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:52.040
I choose to run
toward my problems

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:53.280
and not away from them.

1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:55.680
Because that's what...

1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:02.760
Because that's what heroes do.

1:13:14.480 --> 1:13:15.720
Friend stay!

1:13:27.760 --> 1:13:28.920
Yes!

1:13:43.560 --> 1:13:44.560
All right.

1:13:48.560 --> 1:13:49.560

1:14:14.440 --> 1:14:16.440
-Welcome, Point Break.

1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:20.120
-Friend stay!

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:22.400
No, no, no! Stop!

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:24.160
-Stay!
-

1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:25.800
Stop!
Stop breaking everything!

1:14:26.080 --> 1:14:27.440
Don't go!

1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:32.000
Nice work, big guy.

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:33.560
We don't know
where Ultron's headed,

1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:35.640
but you're going very high,
very fast.

1:14:35.960 --> 1:14:37.440
So, I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?

1:14:38.280 --> 1:14:40.640
We can't track you
in stealth mode...

1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:42.600
so I need you
to help me out. Okay?

1:14:46.480 --> 1:14:47.840
I need you to...

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:06.320
No! No, Banner!

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.040
Oh, jeez.

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:17.520
Banner.

1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:20.200
-Hey, hey, hey.
-

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:21.800
-You all right, Banner?
-

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:23.200
-

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:26.160
Sun's going down.
Sun's going down.

1:15:26.800 --> 1:15:28.000
That's it, breathe.

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:30.520
I won't hurt you.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:32.400
-Sun's going down.
-

1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:34.000
-Thor.
-Yeah.

1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:36.200
What happened to your hair?

1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:37.720
Some creepy old man
cut it off.

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:39.240
-It looks good.
-Oh, thanks.

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:41.720
Where are we? Oh, how's Nat?

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:44.880
-Uh, Nat is good, I'm sure.
-Is she okay?

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:46.880
-And what about Sokovia?
-Sokovia?

1:15:47.200 --> 1:15:48.560
The city, Sokovia.
Did we save it?

1:15:48.880 --> 1:15:49.880
-Banner, listen.
-What?

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:52.040
Sokovia. Ultron.
That was two years ago.

1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:53.720
-What are you saying?
-Well...

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:55.000
What?

1:15:55.880 --> 1:15:57.200
I've been Hulk for two years?

1:15:57.680 --> 1:15:58.880
I'm afraid so.

1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:06.120
What the hell happened?

1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:11.240
Banner, there's something
you should know.

1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:18.920

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:20.000
Ship's log.

1:16:31.560 --> 1:16:33.000
Thor, where are we?

1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:34.240
Yeah, about that.

1:16:34.440 --> 1:16:35.720
Sakaar, hear ye.

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:37.480
Attention please.
I have some bad news.

1:16:37.760 --> 1:16:40.440
My beloved exalted champion
has turned up missing.

1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:42.880
Take to the streets.
Celebrate my champion.

1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:43.920
BANNER: Who's that?

1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:45.760
He kind of runs the place.

1:16:46.720 --> 1:16:47.920
You actually lived
at his house for awhile.

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:49.080
-I did?
-Yeah.

1:16:49.440 --> 1:16:51.200
Quite a lot's happened. You
and I had a fight recently.

1:16:51.960 --> 1:16:53.640
-Did I win?
-No, I won. Easily.

1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:55.120
Doesn't sound right.

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:56.240
Well, it's true.

1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:58.320
It seems that that
criminally seductive

1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:00.800
Lord of Thunder
has stolen him away.

1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:03.440
Seductive God of Thunder.
We need to move.

1:17:04.400 --> 1:17:05.400
Oh, no.

1:17:07.280 --> 1:17:08.320
This is bad.

1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:10.400
This is really, really bad.

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:16.800
Thor, I think
I'm freaking out.

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:18.440
No, no, no.

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:20.440
Don't freak out. You're okay.
Put these on.

1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:21.680
These are Tony's clothes.

1:17:21.880 --> 1:17:23.120
-I know, come on.
-Is he here?

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:25.160
No, he's not here. But listen.
Just stay calm, okay?

1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:27.480
The sun's going down.
The sun's getting really low.

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:28.520
Sun's going down.

1:17:36.320 --> 1:17:38.160
GRANDMASTER: I'm upset!

1:17:41.240 --> 1:17:43.000
I'm very upset.

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.160
You know what I like about
being upset? The blame.

1:17:45.480 --> 1:17:47.640
Right now, that's
the mindset that I'm in.

1:17:47.680 --> 1:17:48.680
And you know who I'm blaming?

1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:50.480
-Grandmaster, I can...
-Hey!

1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:51.640
Don't interrupt me!

1:17:51.840 --> 1:17:52.840
Here you go.

1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:54.960
Why are you handing me
the melt stick?

1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:56.920
He was interrupting.

1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:58.960
That's not
a capital violation.

1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:00.400
Where was I?

1:18:00.960 --> 1:18:03.320
My precious champion
has come up missing...

1:18:03.560 --> 1:18:05.520
and it's all because
of that Lord of Thunder.

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:07.800
It's all because of him.
Your brother.

1:18:08.120 --> 1:18:10.960
Whatever the story is.
Adopted, or complicated.

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:12.120
I'm sure
there's a big history.

1:18:12.360 --> 1:18:13.360
And your contender...

1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:15.120
LOKI: My dear friend...

1:18:15.520 --> 1:18:17.200
if you were to give me
12 hours,

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:18.680
I could bring them both
back to you. Alive.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:20.360
I could do it in two.

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:22.360
I could do it in one.

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:23.560
Let's stop there.

1:18:23.840 --> 1:18:25.520
You know what?
I woke up this morning

1:18:25.600 --> 1:18:27.320
thinking about
a public execution.

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:29.360
But for now, I'll settle
for this sweet little...

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:32.360
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:36.000
So, you're on the clock.

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.040
What have you done?

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:40.400
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1:18:40.560 --> 1:18:41.560
It's Loki.

1:18:41.720 --> 1:18:43.200
And you will answer
to the Grandmaster.

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:46.240
-Hmm.

1:18:46.520 --> 1:18:49.240
Why would you help my brother
escape with that green fool?

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:50.720
I don't help anyone.

1:18:57.400 --> 1:18:58.400
You're a Valkyrie.

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:05.520
I thought the Valkyrie had
all died gruesome deaths.

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:08.400
Choose your next words wisely.

1:19:08.760 --> 1:19:11.880
I'm terribly sorry.
Must be a very painful memory.

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:07.120
THOR: The sun's going down.
It's getting really low.

1:20:08.480 --> 1:20:09.680
The sun's going down.

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:11.240
-It's getting real low.
-Oh, shoot.

1:20:11.600 --> 1:20:13.800
-Sun's getting low.
-Would you stop saying that?

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:14.960
I just need you to stay calm.

1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:17.000
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1:20:17.320 --> 1:20:18.960
It's just a planet. You've
been on a planet before.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:20.040
Yeah. One.

1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:21.960
Now you've been on two.
That's a good thing.

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:23.320
It's a new experience.

1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:25.480
My neurons,
they're firing faster

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:27.560
than my brain can handle
the information.

1:20:27.840 --> 1:20:30.000
The whole thing is totally
different this time.

1:20:30.280 --> 1:20:32.000
In the past, I always felt
like Hulk and I

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:33.320
each had a hand on the wheel.

1:20:33.720 --> 1:20:35.400
But this time, it's like
he had the keys

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:37.000
to the car and I was
locked in the trunk.

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:39.040
All right, well, you're back
now. That's all that matters.

1:20:39.280 --> 1:20:40.320
No, it's not what matters.

1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:41.600
What I'm trying
to tell you, is that

1:20:41.680 --> 1:20:43.160
if I turn into
the Hulk again...

1:20:43.480 --> 1:20:44.840
Banner may never come back.

1:20:45.120 --> 1:20:46.360
And we're stranded on a planet

1:20:46.440 --> 1:20:48.160
that is designed
to stress me out.

1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:49.360
We're not stranded.

1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:50.800
I'm gonna figure out a way
to get us home.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:52.360
Thank you.

1:20:52.680 --> 1:20:54.680
Not your home, though. Asgard.
My home.

1:20:55.040 --> 1:20:56.000
What?

1:20:56.320 --> 1:20:57.840
Listen, my people
are in great danger.

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:00.640
You and I, we have to fight
this really powerful being...

1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:02.640
who also happens
to be my sister.

1:21:02.880 --> 1:21:04.520
Okay, that is so wrong
on so many...

1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:05.880
I don't wanna
fight your sister.

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.200
That's a family issue.

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:08.520
No, she's an evil being.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.440
I don't care what she is.

1:21:10.520 --> 1:21:12.720
I'm not fighting any
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:13.920
-What?
-I just told you.

1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:15.760
If I turn into the Hulk,

1:21:15.880 --> 1:21:17.040
I am never gonna
come back again.

1:21:17.200 --> 1:21:18.280
And you don't care.

1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:20.160
No, no. I'm putting together
the team.

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:21.680
The Hulk is the fire.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:23.640
Wait, you're just using me
to get to the Hulk.

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:25.280
-What? No!
-It's gross.

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:27.200
You don't care about me.
You're not my friend.

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.200
No! I don't even
like the Hulk.

1:21:29.320 --> 1:21:30.560
He's all like...

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:32.080
"Smash, smash, smash."

1:21:32.400 --> 1:21:33.400
I prefer you.

1:21:34.320 --> 1:21:35.320
Thanks.

1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:37.680
But if I'm being honest,

1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.120
when it comes
to fighting evil beings...

1:21:39.400 --> 1:21:40.680
he is very powerful
and useful.

1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:42.760
Yeah, Banner's powerful
and useful, too.

1:21:43.080 --> 1:21:44.200
Is he though?

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:46.480
How many PhDs
does Hulk have? Zero.

1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:48.400
How many PhDs does
Banner have? Seven.

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.240
Fine, you don't have
to fight anyone.

1:21:51.520 --> 1:21:53.280
But we're in danger here,
so we have to move.

1:21:57.400 --> 1:21:58.480
What are you doing with that?

1:21:58.680 --> 1:21:59.680
I need a disguise.
I'm a fugitive.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.440
-I need a disguise.
-You are the disguise.

1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:03.760
-I'll be Tony Stark.
-What?

1:22:04.080 --> 1:22:05.720
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:08.440
No, no, you're not Tony.
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1:22:08.680 --> 1:22:09.880
Then why did you dress me up
like Tony?

1:22:10.080 --> 1:22:11.080
Because you were naked.

1:22:11.280 --> 1:22:12.440
Okay, I'll give you that.

1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:14.560
What are you doing?
Stop doing that!

1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:15.960
Tony wears his pants
super tight.

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:17.120
-Stop it!
-I'm sorry.

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:19.440
-Why are you being so weird?
-I don't know.

1:22:19.720 --> 1:22:21.920
Maybe the fact that I was
trapped for two years...

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:24.600
inside of a monster
made me a little weird.

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:26.520
Hey. Shh. It's okay.

1:22:26.800 --> 1:22:29.080
You're good. Calm down.
Come on.

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:30.600
Listen, we're gonna
go to Asgard...

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:31.880
and you're not gonna
have to think about

1:22:31.960 --> 1:22:32.960
the Hulk ever again.

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:34.280
-All right?
-All right.

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:37.080
-

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:40.000
Hulk!

1:22:41.960 --> 1:22:43.600
Oh. This is bad.

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:49.080
Banner! Banner!

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:54.160
Banner!

1:23:07.840 --> 1:23:08.920
Banner!

1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:10.560
Thor!

1:23:21.840 --> 1:23:22.840
Hi.

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:24.160
Hi.

1:23:24.360 --> 1:23:25.680
I was gonna do that.

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:26.840
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:29.000
That's good.
What are you doing here?

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:31.680
What are you doing here?
I thought you were leaving.

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:32.840
I got sidetracked.

1:23:33.360 --> 1:23:34.360
What's with the...

1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:35.920
It's my disguise.

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:37.040
But I can see your face.

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:39.200
Not when I do this, you can't.

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:41.680
Your hair looks nice.
I like what you did with it.

1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:43.200
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:50.680
BANNER: What are those things
on her eyes?

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:52.080
Are those the people
that she's killed?

1:23:52.360 --> 1:23:53.840
She's so beautiful and strong
and courageous.

1:23:54.080 --> 1:23:55.080
Who is this guy?

1:23:55.200 --> 1:23:56.200
-He's a friend.
-Who? Me?

1:23:56.240 --> 1:23:57.600
-I'm Bruce.
-I feel like I know you.

1:23:57.880 --> 1:23:59.800
I feel like I know you, too.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:06.320
Look, I've spent years
in a haze,

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:07.800
-trying to forget my past.
-THOR: Mmm.

1:24:08.320 --> 1:24:09.640
Sakaar seemed like
the best place

1:24:09.720 --> 1:24:11.960
to drink and forget,
and to die one day.

1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:13.960
I was thinking
that you drink too much,

1:24:14.040 --> 1:24:15.400
and that probably
was gonna kill you.

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:16.680
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1:24:16.840 --> 1:24:19.040
-Oh.
-But I don't wanna forget.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:20.840
I can't turn away anymore...

1:24:21.560 --> 1:24:23.240
so if I'm gonna die...

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:25.120
well, it may as well be
driving my sword

1:24:25.240 --> 1:24:26.560
through the heart
of that murderous hag.

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:28.360
-Good.
-BANNER: Yeah.

1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:31.520
So, I'm saying
that I wanna be on the team.

1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:33.400
Has it got a name?

1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:36.280
Yeah, it's called
the Revengers.

1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:37.680
Revengers?

1:24:37.760 --> 1:24:40.160
Because I'm getting revenge.
You're getting revenge.

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:43.280
Do you want revenge?

1:24:43.440 --> 1:24:45.600
I'm undecided.

1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:46.920
Okay.

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:49.240
Also, I've got
a peace offering.

1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:54.440
Surprise.

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:01.440
Ow.

1:25:01.560 --> 1:25:02.880
Just had to be sure.

1:25:06.640 --> 1:25:07.640
Hello, Bruce.

1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:10.880
So, last time I saw you,

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:12.080
you were trying
to kill everybody.

1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:13.440
Where are you at these days?

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:15.760
It varies
from moment to moment.

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:18.040
THOR: Is that a Dragonfang?

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:19.800
It is.

1:25:19.880 --> 1:25:20.920
THOR: My God.

1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:23.960
This is the famed sword
of the Valkyrie.

1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:25.880
Sakaar and Asgard
are about as far apart

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:27.120
as any two known systems.

1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:30.120
Our best bet is a wormhole
just outside of city limits.

1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:32.440
Refuel on Xandar, and
we can be back in Asgard

1:25:32.480 --> 1:25:33.960
in 18 months.

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:37.360
Nope. We are going through
the big one.

1:25:37.640 --> 1:25:38.640
The Devil's Anus?

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:39.960
Anus?

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:41.120
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1:25:41.360 --> 1:25:42.360
For the record, I didn't know

1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:43.480
it was called that
when I picked it.

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:45.160
That looks like
a collapsing neutron star...

1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:47.640
inside of an
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1:25:48.080 --> 1:25:49.240
We need another ship.

1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:50.680
That would tear
mine to pieces.

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.520
THOR: She's right. We need one
that can withstand

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:53.680
the geodetic strain
from the singularity.

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.840
And has an offline
power steering system...

1:25:55.960 --> 1:25:58.520
that could also function
without the on-board computer.

1:25:58.840 --> 1:26:00.160
And we need one
with cup holders,

1:26:00.240 --> 1:26:01.800
because we're gonna die.
So, drinks!

1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:03.960
Do I know you?
I feel like I know you.

1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:05.960
I feel like I know you, too.
It's weird.

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:07.160
THOR: What do you say?

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:08.480
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:09.840
through a volatile
cosmic gateway.

1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:11.240
Talk about an adventure.

1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:13.520
-We need a ship.
-Need a ship.

1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:14.800
There are one or two ships.

1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:15.840
Absolute top of the line
models...

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:17.360
I don't mean to impose...

1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:22.360
But the Grandmaster
has a great many ships.

1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.400
I may even have stolen

1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:26.480
the access codes
to his security system.

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:27.720
And suddenly you're overcome

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:28.920
with an urge
to do the right thing.

1:26:29.200 --> 1:26:30.200
Heavens, no.

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:31.920
I've run out of favor
with the Grandmaster...

1:26:32.040 --> 1:26:33.840
and in exchange for codes
and access to a ship...

1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:37.200
I'm asking for safe passage
through the Anus.

1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:38.880
You're telling us
that you can get us

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:40.120
access into the garage...

1:26:40.200 --> 1:26:41.840
without setting off
any alarms?

1:26:42.280 --> 1:26:43.840
Yes, brother. I can.

1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:46.720
A quick FYI.

1:26:47.040 --> 1:26:48.600
I was just talking to him
just a couple minutes ago...

1:26:48.880 --> 1:26:51.200
and he was totally ready
to kill any of us.

1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:52.560
He did try to kill me.

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:54.560
Yes, me too.
On many, many occasions.

1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:56.320
There was one time
when we were children...

1:26:56.560 --> 1:26:58.040
he transformed himself
into a snake,

1:26:58.120 --> 1:26:59.200
and he knows
that I love snakes.

1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:01.200
So, I went to pick up
the snake to admire it...

1:27:01.520 --> 1:27:02.880
and he transformed back
into himself

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.160
and he was like,
"Yeah, it's me!"

1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:07.240
And he stabbed me.
We were eight at the time.

1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:08.880
VALKYRIE: If we're
boosting a ship...

1:27:09.160 --> 1:27:10.600
we're gonna need to draw some
guards away from the palace.

1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:12.200
Why not set the beast loose?

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:13.400
Shut up.

1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:14.600
You guys have a beast?

1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:17.160
No, there's no beast.
He's just being stupid.

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:18.880
We're going to start
a revolution.

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:20.400
-Revolution?
-I'll explain later.

1:27:20.960 --> 1:27:23.160
-Who's this guy again?
-I'll explain later.

1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:26.480
Is that
some sort of protoplasm,

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:27.720
all the stuff
that's coming out of you...

1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:29.040
or are they eggs?

1:27:30.560 --> 1:27:31.640
Looks like eggs.

1:27:33.640 --> 1:27:35.080
-Oh!
-

1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:42.440
I'm looking for Korg.

1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:43.920
Who's asking?

1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:45.280
I know you're asking.

1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:47.440
Is anyone else asking,
or is it just you?

1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:49.760
The Lord of Thunder
sends his best.

1:27:53.440 --> 1:27:55.440
The revolution has begun.

1:27:55.760 --> 1:27:57.640
Revolution?
How did this happen?

1:27:57.960 --> 1:27:59.400
Don't know.

1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:01.080
But the arena's mainframe

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:02.720
for the Obedience Disks
have been deactivated...

1:28:02.960 --> 1:28:04.920
and the slaves
have armed themselves.

1:28:05.080 --> 1:28:07.000
Oh. I don't like that word.

1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:08.440
Which? Mainframe?

1:28:08.760 --> 1:28:10.760
No. Why would I not like
"mainframe"?

1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:12.960
No, the "S" word.

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:15.760
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs
have armed themselves.

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:18.480
Okay, that's better.

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:26.480
Hey, so, listen.
We should talk.

1:28:27.960 --> 1:28:28.960
I disagree.

1:28:29.480 --> 1:28:32.320
Open communication
was never our family's forte.

1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:33.640
You have no idea.

1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:36.440
Been quite the revelation
since we last spoke.

1:28:36.480 --> 1:28:37.480
Hello.

1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:39.600
Hi.

1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:48.240
Odin brought us together.

1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:52.120
It's almost poetic that his
death should split us apart.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:00.240
We might as well be
strangers now.

1:29:00.520 --> 1:29:03.480
Two sons of the crown,
set adrift.

1:29:03.800 --> 1:29:05.680
-Oh.
-

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:08.160
Thought you didn't
wanna talk about it.

1:29:09.640 --> 1:29:10.640
Here's the thing.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.680
I'm probably better off
staying here on Sakaar.

1:29:12.840 --> 1:29:14.520
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:17.840
Did you just agree with me?

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:19.600
Come on, this place
is perfect for you.

1:29:19.840 --> 1:29:21.480
It's savage,
chaotic, lawless...

1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:23.280
Brother, you're gonna do
great here.

1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:25.080
Do you truly think
so little of me?

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:29.000
Loki, I thought
the world of you.

1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:32.680
I thought we were gonna fight
side by side forever.

1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:35.680
But at the end of the day,
you're you and I'm me.

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:38.840
I don't know, maybe
there's still good in you.

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.200
But let's be honest,

1:29:40.320 --> 1:29:42.520
our paths diverged
a long time ago.

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:48.320
Yeah.

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:50.560
It's probably for the best

1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:51.720
that we never
see each other again.

1:29:52.040 --> 1:29:53.120
That's what you always wanted.

1:29:57.560 --> 1:29:59.120
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:00.400
-What?
-"Get Help."

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:01.480
No.

1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:02.560
-Come on, you love it.
-I hate it.

1:30:02.640 --> 1:30:03.640
It's great.
It works every time.

1:30:03.720 --> 1:30:05.360
-It's humiliating.
-Do you have a better plan?

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:06.960
-No.
-We're doing it.

1:30:07.120 --> 1:30:08.840
We are not doing "Get Help."

1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:11.080
-Get help! Please!

1:30:11.360 --> 1:30:12.360
My brother, he's dying.

1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:14.480
Get help! Help him!

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:17.760
Classic.

1:30:17.920 --> 1:30:19.240
Still hate it.

1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:21.760
-It's humiliating.
-Not for me, it's not.

1:30:21.960 --> 1:30:24.040
Now, which one's the ship
she told us to get?

1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:25.080
The Commodore.

1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:27.040
THOR: Right.

1:30:29.760 --> 1:30:32.280
Though I feel it won't make
much of a difference.

1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:36.240
Oh, Loki.

1:30:37.440 --> 1:30:38.720
I know I've betrayed you
many times before...

1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:40.520
but this time
it's truly nothing personal.

1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:42.600
The reward for your capture

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:43.760
-will set me up nicely.
-

1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:45.520
Never one for sentiment,
were you?

1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:47.120
Easier to let it burn.

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:48.440
I agree.

1:30:57.120 --> 1:30:58.640
Oh, that looks painful.

1:30:59.440 --> 1:31:02.120
Oh, dear brother,
you're becoming predictable.

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:04.280
I trust you, you betray me.

1:31:04.640 --> 1:31:06.560
Round and round
in circles we go.

1:31:06.800 --> 1:31:08.720
See, Loki, life is about,
it's about growth.

1:31:08.960 --> 1:31:10.120
It's about change.

1:31:10.360 --> 1:31:13.320
But you seem to
just wanna stay the same.

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:15.640
I guess
what I'm trying to say...

1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:18.760
is that you'll always be
the God of Mischief...

1:31:19.040 --> 1:31:20.360
but you could be more.

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:24.960
I'll just put this over here
for you.

1:31:25.560 --> 1:31:28.920
Anyway, all got places to be,
so good luck.

1:31:34.320 --> 1:31:35.600
All right,
I can figure this out.

1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:37.840
It's just another spaceship.

1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:52.520
Loyal Sakaarians...

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:54.680
Lord of Thunder
has stolen my ship

1:31:54.760 --> 1:31:56.160
and my favorite champion.

1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:00.840
Sakaarians, take to the skies.
Bring him down.

1:32:01.040 --> 1:32:02.680
Do not let him
leave this planet.

1:32:15.880 --> 1:32:17.160
-Good shot!
-Thanks.

1:32:20.200 --> 1:32:21.200
Open the doors.

1:32:21.320 --> 1:32:22.640
Okay.

1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:29.720
I hope that you're tougher
than you look.

1:32:29.880 --> 1:32:30.960
Why?

1:32:34.640 --> 1:32:36.840
-

1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:45.240
Shouldn't we be shooting back
or something?

1:32:45.280 --> 1:32:46.280
Yes, we should.

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:48.400
Where are the guns
on this ship?

1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:50.000
VALKYRIE: There aren't any.

1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:51.680
-It's a leisure vessel.
-BANNER: What?

1:32:52.000 --> 1:32:53.440
Grandmaster uses it
for his good times,

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:54.560
orgies and stuff.

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:56.240
Did she just say
the Grandmaster

1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:57.440
uses it for orgies?

1:32:57.760 --> 1:32:58.880
Yeah.

1:32:59.080 --> 1:33:00.400
Don't touch anything.

1:33:20.840 --> 1:33:22.080
No!

1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:26.120
-No!
-No!

1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:34.200
Get inside!

1:33:34.440 --> 1:33:35.920
In a minute.

1:33:47.280 --> 1:33:49.120
I should probably go and help.
Here, take the wheel.

1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.640
No. I don't know
how to fly one of these.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:52.640
You're a scientist.
Use one of your PhDs.

1:33:52.760 --> 1:33:55.960
None of them are for flying
alien spaceships!

1:34:30.720 --> 1:34:31.720
Okay, come on.

1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:33.840
There's gotta be a gun
on this thing.

1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:35.000
That looks like a gun.

1:34:36.320 --> 1:34:37.640
It's my birthday

1:34:37.680 --> 1:34:38.720
It's my birthday

1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:40.680
It's my birthday

1:34:48.720 --> 1:34:49.840
Yeah!

1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:53.000
-

1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:09.520
Guys, we're coming up
on the Devil's Anus!

1:35:16.320 --> 1:35:17.280
There she is.

1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:19.400
Our ticket out of here.

1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:21.200
Hey, what's this?

1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:25.680
-

1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:27.400
Thank you.

1:35:27.440 --> 1:35:30.000
Hey, man. We're about to jump
on that ginormous spaceship.

1:35:30.080 --> 1:35:31.080
You wanna come?

1:35:31.400 --> 1:35:34.080
You do seem like

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:35.600
you're in desperate need
of leadership.

1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:37.440
Why, thank you.

1:35:41.360 --> 1:35:42.360
Here we go.

1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:49.920
Shit.

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:09.200
SKURGE: Asgardians...

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.800
some misguided soul...

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:14.640
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:17.240
Tell us where it is...

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:20.000
or there will be consequences.

1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:24.960
Bad ones.

1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:29.280
Well?

1:36:36.480 --> 1:36:37.480
You.

1:37:13.680 --> 1:37:17.680
Well? Executioner?

1:37:22.680 --> 1:37:23.880
-MAN: Wait!

1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:25.000
Wait!

1:37:27.360 --> 1:37:28.520
I know where the sword is.

1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:13.920
I never thought
I'd be back here.

1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:19.080
BANNER: I thought
it'd be a lot nicer.

1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:21.080
I mean,
not that it's not nice.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:22.560
It's just, it's on fire.

1:38:22.760 --> 1:38:23.760
Here, up here
in the mountains.

1:38:24.240 --> 1:38:26.360
Heat signatures.
People clustered together.

1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:27.520
She's coming for them.

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:28.840
Okay, drop me off
at the palace

1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:31.040
-and I'll draw her away.
-And get yourself killed?

1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:32.920
The people trapped down there
are all that matters.

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:34.280
While I'm dealing with Hela,
I need you two

1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:35.480
to help get
everyone off Asgard.

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:37.600
How the hell are we supposed
to do that?

1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:39.760
I have a man on the ground.

1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:46.680
Asgard.

1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:51.440
She's here.

1:39:03.160 --> 1:39:04.760
Now the ship has a gun.

1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:06.120
I'll take it from here.

1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:09.960
I found this in the armory.

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:14.280
Good luck.

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:17.160
Your Majesty...

1:39:19.280 --> 1:39:20.280
don't die.

1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:24.960
You know what I mean.

1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:25.760
HEIMDALL: We must keep moving!

1:40:26.520 --> 1:40:28.160
Go to the Bifrost!

1:41:10.920 --> 1:41:12.040
Sister.

1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:15.920
You're still alive.

1:41:16.240 --> 1:41:18.080
I love what you've done
with the place.

1:41:18.200 --> 1:41:19.520
Redecorating, I see.

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:21.920
It seems our father's solution

1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:24.440
to every problem
was to cover it up.

1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:27.600
Or to cast it out.

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:33.400
He told you you were worthy.
He said the same thing to me.

1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:35.320
You see?

1:41:36.080 --> 1:41:38.080
You never knew him.

1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:40.280
Not at his best.

1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:43.440
Odin and I drowned
entire civilizations

1:41:43.560 --> 1:41:45.040
in blood and tears.

1:41:45.320 --> 1:41:48.120
Where do you think
all this gold came from?

1:41:48.440 --> 1:41:50.040
And then, one day...

1:41:50.280 --> 1:41:53.200
he decided to become
a benevolent king.

1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:56.040
To foster peace,
to protect life...

1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:58.760
to have you.

1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:01.600
I understand why you're angry.

1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:03.280
And you are my sister,
and technically

1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:05.640
have a claim to the throne.

1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:07.800
And believe me, I would love
for someone else to rule.

1:42:07.920 --> 1:42:09.040
But it can't be you.

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:12.800
The worst.

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:15.960
Okay, get up.

1:42:16.360 --> 1:42:18.240
You're in my seat.

1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:21.320
You know,
Father once told me...

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:23.960
that a wise king
never seeks out war.

1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:26.640
But must always
be ready for it.

1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:00.360
Go back!

1:43:05.520 --> 1:43:06.720
HEIMDALL: Go!

1:43:41.880 --> 1:43:44.320
To be honest, I expected more.

1:43:47.560 --> 1:43:48.560
Heimdall!

1:43:50.880 --> 1:43:52.520
The sword!

1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:58.560
Here's the difference
between us.

1:43:58.920 --> 1:44:00.360
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:02.920
the rightful heir,
the savior of Asgard.

1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:04.920
-And you're nothing.
-

1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:17.920
So simple,
even a blind man could see it.

1:44:20.240 --> 1:44:21.280
Oh.

1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:23.920
Now you remind me of Dad.

1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:35.920
The stupid dog won't die!

1:44:58.080 --> 1:45:00.800
Everything's gonna be
all right now. I got this.

1:45:01.280 --> 1:45:03.280
You wanted to know who I am?

1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:05.800
What the hell
are you talking about?

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:07.440
You'll see!

1:45:56.200 --> 1:45:58.320
You see?
No one's going anywhere.

1:45:58.600 --> 1:45:59.840
I'll get that sword...

1:46:00.040 --> 1:46:02.680
even if I have to kill every
single one of them to do it.

1:46:29.520 --> 1:46:30.720
Hey, man.

1:46:32.040 --> 1:46:33.320
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:34.680
We're gonna jump
on that spaceship

1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:35.840
and get out of here.
Wanna come?

1:46:45.480 --> 1:46:49.240
Your savior is here.

1:46:56.880 --> 1:46:58.600
Did you miss me?

1:46:58.920 --> 1:47:00.080
Everyone, on that ship now.

1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.720
Welcome home.
I saw you coming.

1:47:06.960 --> 1:47:07.960
Of course you did.

1:47:24.880 --> 1:47:26.960
It's a valiant effort,
but you never stood a chance.

1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:29.120
You see...

1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:32.720
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1:47:34.800 --> 1:47:36.320
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:39.720
What were you
the god of, again?

1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:53.000
Even when you had two eyes...

1:47:53.920 --> 1:47:55.640
you'd see
only half the picture.

1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:00.000
She's too strong.
Without my hammer, I can't.

1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:04.760
Are you Thor,
the God of Hammers? Hmm?

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.320
That hammer was to help you
control your power,

1:48:10.360 --> 1:48:11.640
to focus it.

1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:14.160
It was never your source
of strength.

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:17.160
It's too late.
She's already taken Asgard.

1:48:18.440 --> 1:48:21.000
Asgard is not a place.
Never was.

1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:23.440
This could be Asgard.

1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.840
Asgard is where
our people stand.

1:48:27.840 --> 1:48:32.480
Even now, right now,
those people need your help.

1:48:40.320 --> 1:48:42.320
I'm not as strong as you.

1:48:45.200 --> 1:48:46.200
No...

1:48:47.600 --> 1:48:48.880
you're stronger.

1:48:58.000 --> 1:48:59.200
Tell me, brother.

1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:01.680
What were you
the god of again?

1:49:06.200 --> 1:49:08.080
-

1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:19.360
-You're late.
-You're missing an eye.

1:51:19.680 --> 1:51:21.000
VALKYRIE: This isn't over.

1:51:28.320 --> 1:51:29.920
I think we should
disband the Revengers.

1:51:31.560 --> 1:51:32.640
Hit her
with a lightning blast.

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:34.040
I just hit her with
the biggest lightning blast

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:35.280
in the history of lightning.

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:36.360
It did nothing.

1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:42.640
We just need to hold her off
until everyone's on board.

1:51:43.400 --> 1:51:44.840
It won't end there.

1:51:45.280 --> 1:51:48.560
The longer Hela's on Asgard,
the more powerful she grows.

1:51:48.880 --> 1:51:50.400
She'll hunt us down.

1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:52.040
We need to stop her
here and now.

1:51:52.360 --> 1:51:53.360
So what do we do?

1:51:54.400 --> 1:51:55.720
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1:52:08.160 --> 1:52:11.240
Asgard's not a place,
it's a people.

1:52:13.320 --> 1:52:14.320
Loki...

1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:16.440
this was never about
stopping Ragnarok.

1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:18.680
This was about
causing Ragnarok.

1:52:18.920 --> 1:52:20.400
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:23.480
It's the only way.

1:52:24.200 --> 1:52:25.520
Bold move, brother.

1:52:26.920 --> 1:52:28.240
Even for me.

1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:32.600
Shall we?

1:52:33.760 --> 1:52:34.760
After you.

1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:01.760
This is madness.

1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:16.800
Go! Go, now!

1:54:18.080 --> 1:54:19.360
For Asgard.

1:54:33.840 --> 1:54:35.040
SKURGE: Hela!

1:54:59.720 --> 1:55:03.720
With the Eternal Flame,
you are reborn.
