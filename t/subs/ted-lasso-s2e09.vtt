WEBVTT

00:04.046 --> 00:07.007
I don't wanna ride back with you guys.
Rather go shake this off.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.343
Yeah, sure. No, of course.

00:10.052 --> 00:13.555
Hey. Hey, hey.
Just-- Be careful out there, all right?

00:15.432 --> 00:17.392
Yeah? Okay. And don't forget,

00:17.976 --> 00:22.064
tomorrow it's your turn for coffee
at the game film, all right?

00:22.147 --> 00:23.357
-Yeah.
-Bright and early.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.946
Hey, Coach. Bird by bird.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.323
Not that kind of bird.

00:37.579 --> 00:43.627
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone

00:44.169 --> 00:48.799
Without a dream in my heart

00:49.299 --> 00:52.010
Without a love of my own

00:56.849 --> 00:59.184
Mind the gap.

00:59.852 --> 01:03.272
This is the southbound
metropolitan line train to Aldgate.

01:07.651 --> 01:10.195
Doors closing.
Stand clear of the doors, please.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.492
It was moment after moment like this.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.702
A real David versus Goliath match,

02:41.245 --> 02:44.665
but where Goliath just curb-stomped David
in the back of the skull

02:44.748 --> 02:46.416
like in that Ed Norton movie.

02:46.875 --> 02:47.960
Moonrise Kingdom?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.545
I think that's it, yeah.

02:49.628 --> 02:53.048
Yeah. Well, for me,
the match was a real Cinderella story.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.010
If her glass slipper broke
and sliced her Achilles tendon.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.638
Thierry, was this just
an off day for the players?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.557
Or do we lay the blame
on the coaching staff?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.725
100% coaching staff.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.435
Those are good footballers.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.480
It just felt like Richmond had no plan.

03:08.564 --> 03:12.067
-And what about Coach Beard?
-What about him, indeed.

03:12.150 --> 03:15.070
Coach Beard knew an aggressive
offensive strategy was a mistake.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.907
He should not have let Ted,
Nathan and Roy convince him otherwise.

03:18.991 --> 03:22.411
Great point, Thierry.
Coach Beard is Ted Lasso's number two.

03:22.494 --> 03:25.247
He's supposed to challenge him,
not just be a sniveling lackey.

03:26.248 --> 03:29.126
Look, Gary, the man has no va-va-voom.

03:29.209 --> 03:34.173
Does anything say "sad, single man"
more than a chessboard coffee table?

03:36.008 --> 03:38.594
I know I'm French
and expected to say things like this,

03:38.677 --> 03:41.805
but I hate Coach Beard.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.100
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

03:45.184 --> 03:47.519
After Richard Montlaur
earned himself a red card,

03:47.603 --> 03:49.313
things went from bad to worse.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.379
Ted joining you?

04:14.463 --> 04:15.506
No.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.091
-Jane coming?
-We broke up.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.593
Shocking.

04:19.676 --> 04:21.720
She accused me of being jealous. Me.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.723
Because I told her
it's hard to know where I stand,

04:24.806 --> 04:27.267
which it is,
because she never says "I love you."

04:27.351 --> 04:29.603
-Did you say it to her?
-I did.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.855
-And she didn't say it back.
-She did not.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.983
Thank you for helping me relive that.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.819
Well, you must feel awful.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.657
Reason is powerless
in the expression of love.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.326
Nuh-uh. I meant about the match.

04:44.409 --> 04:47.412
What the hell was your thinking
behind those tactics?

04:47.496 --> 04:50.374
-Mae.
-All right. Enjoy your beer.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.546
But come on.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.674
There's no way you thought coming out
on the attack was a good idea.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.553
You basically left Zoreaux
back there to defend by himself.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.931
In a semifinal…

05:07.307 --> 05:09.059
A semifinal!

05:39.214 --> 05:41.425
Oi, Beard. Dropped your keys.

05:42.384 --> 05:43.385
Thanks.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.971
-Rough match, mate.
-We thought you needed a hug.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.725
-I thought you needed a hug.
-Do you wanna talk about it?

05:49.808 --> 05:51.351
We can talk and drink

05:51.435 --> 05:54.271
as long as we talk about
anything but the game and drink.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.612
-Have you ever been to Vegas?
-What's Ted like behind closed doors?

06:01.695 --> 06:03.780
How do you cope knowing
the universe is infinite

06:03.864 --> 06:05.991
but your consciousness can end
in a second?

06:11.872 --> 06:13.373
I've been to Vegas many times.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.877
One night is good,
two nights is perfect, three is too many.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.254
Ted is a man. Just a man.

06:19.755 --> 06:23.550
And as for the fragility of life,
I'm so glad someone finally asked.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.428
Because, yeah, I got a few thoughts.

06:31.600 --> 06:35.229
And so, in conclusion,

06:35.312 --> 06:37.689
if this is all indeed a simulation,

06:37.773 --> 06:40.651
which everything
in my experience suggests that it is,

06:41.151 --> 06:45.614
then all we can do is tip our caps
to the rascal pulling the strings.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.576
That's it, people.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.956
Just like my legs after a date with a guy
who kept correcting me,

06:54.039 --> 06:55.040
we're closed.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.917
You went on a date with Richard?

06:57.709 --> 07:00.546
I think you'll find, Mae,
it was two dates.

07:00.629 --> 07:01.630
Out.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.007
Coffee was a date.

07:20.399 --> 07:21.692
Where to next?

07:21.775 --> 07:24.945
Bed. This is England, mate.
Pubs shut at 11:30.

07:25.028 --> 07:28.073
Well, I'm not ready for the night to end.
Any ideas?

07:28.156 --> 07:30.284
What about Bones & Honey?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.743
As if.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.830
Private club, very swanky,
impossible to get in.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.166
Yeah, I heard they once turned away Cher.

07:38.250 --> 07:41.295
Would you believe
They did such a thing?

07:41.378 --> 07:42.880
Well…

07:44.464 --> 07:48.010
Why don't we just head over there
and see what happens?

07:49.761 --> 07:51.054
I think there's a dress code.

08:00.856 --> 08:02.566
Mae, I love you!

08:16.997 --> 08:18.207
Taxi!

08:26.256 --> 08:27.925
-Welcome back, darling.
-Thank you.

08:30.677 --> 08:31.845
Good evening.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.681
Do we know each other?

08:34.765 --> 08:38.058
I don't think we do, sir.
May I see your membership card?

08:38.936 --> 08:41.313
University of Barcelona, class of 2004?

08:41.395 --> 08:43.774
I went to Warwick, 2007.

08:44.441 --> 08:45.817
Sorry, you looked older.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.528
Are you a member here?

08:47.611 --> 08:49.947
Here? No. God, no. Never.

08:50.739 --> 08:54.618
Well, if you're not a member,
I'm afraid you can't come in.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.495
This is Bones & Honey.

08:57.621 --> 08:58.747
You are very rude.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.124
What is your name?

09:01.208 --> 09:04.294
My name is Sarah Coombes.
What is your name?

09:04.378 --> 09:07.256
None of my business.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.561
Bones & Honey, may I help you?

09:21.645 --> 09:22.855
Do you mind?

09:24.606 --> 09:25.607
Speak.

09:25.691 --> 09:27.818
Hello, this is the fire brigade.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.613
It's very important
that we get in touch with--

09:31.697 --> 09:33.866
-Sarah Coombes.
-Sarah Coombes.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.701
That's you.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.620
Well, I'm very sorry, madam,
but your flat is on fire.

09:38.704 --> 09:40.873
You need to come down here immediately.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.376
-Now what?
-Act cool.

09:47.588 --> 09:48.839
Orion's Belt!

09:51.425 --> 09:52.676
Amazing.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.597
We're walking. We're walking.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.435
You did it.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.979
You did what Cher couldn't do.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.065
I actually feel bad for Sarah Coombes.

10:07.149 --> 10:08.942
Nah. Think how excited she'll be

10:09.026 --> 10:11.945
when she realizes that
her place didn't actually burn down.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.740
Tomorrow will be the most beautiful day
of Sarah Coombes's life.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.367
Her apartment will look
more amazing to her

10:17.451 --> 10:19.536
than any place any of us have ever lived.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.414
Here we go.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.336
Okay, gentlemen, plan of attack.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.007
What's wrong?

10:35.469 --> 10:37.012
I don't think we belong here.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.264
Knock that shit off.

10:39.932 --> 10:40.933
We belong.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.061
If you could be anywhere,
where would you wanna be?

10:44.728 --> 10:45.812
Here, right?

10:47.105 --> 10:48.482
Then act like it.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.277
Now who wants an overpriced beer?

10:54.530 --> 10:56.490
Who wants an overpriced beer
that I'm paying for?

10:58.575 --> 10:59.868
Find us a spot.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.663
And feel free to strut.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.273
What can I get you, sir?

11:30.148 --> 11:33.151
-Four beers, please.
-Would you like them in glass, sir?

11:33.235 --> 11:34.528
No.

11:49.001 --> 11:51.587
Relax, fella. It's just angles.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.839
Maybe if you'd paid attention in trig,
you'd do better.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.802
Shall we
have a friendly wager on this shot?

11:59.386 --> 12:00.888
Say, 20 quid?

12:00.971 --> 12:01.972
Hold on.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.932
What's trig?

12:07.144 --> 12:08.228
Trigonometry.

12:08.312 --> 12:09.938
Maths. Yeah?

12:10.647 --> 12:11.732
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.817
Sorry, but where did you guys study?

12:15.152 --> 12:18.197
There you are, lads. Ha.
Thought I'd lost you.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.241
Then where would I be?
Sad and alone.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.160
Evening, gents.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.329
I see you've met my protégés.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.539
I'm Professor
Declan Patrick Aloysius MacManus.

12:27.623 --> 12:29.875
At your service.
I assure you, the pleasure is mine.

12:29.958 --> 12:35.339
But, I must tell you, these lads here were
the best of the best at Oxford itself.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.468
And now, we're just having
a wee liquid reunion, aren't we?

12:40.511 --> 12:42.804
-Oxford?
-Yeah, what were you professor of?

12:42.888 --> 12:45.349
Economics and management, till I retired.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.226
At Oxford.

12:47.809 --> 12:48.810
That is correct.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.687
We were at Oxford.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.732
Christ Church.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.527
Which college were you?

12:58.737 --> 12:59.863
Christ Church?

13:01.073 --> 13:02.241
Our main rivals.

13:03.492 --> 13:05.285
I'm a Merton man, myself.

13:05.369 --> 13:06.995
Merton.

13:08.497 --> 13:09.706
Where'd you live?

13:09.790 --> 13:11.750
Right across from the chapel.

13:12.543 --> 13:15.963
Nothing like waking up every morning
to the sound of the Dobson Organ at 8:15,

13:16.046 --> 13:17.214
am I right?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.220
You Merton motherfucker.

13:25.764 --> 13:28.684
How are you, sir?
When did you leave?

13:28.767 --> 13:31.436
2015. The year we beat Cambridge
in the boat race

13:31.520 --> 13:33.939
by six and a half lengths, lest we forget.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.525
I was on that crew. I was the cox.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.652
Yes, you were, you bastard.

13:40.779 --> 13:43.740
Harry Gill is here!
Harry Gill, in this pub!

13:43.824 --> 13:45.200
Hey!

13:46.076 --> 13:47.578
Marvelous. Marvelous.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.997
Professor McGonagall taught us a lot.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.750
But the main thing he taught us was
the value of money.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.795
£20. You're on.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.928
I got it. I got it.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.263
I've got five.

14:07.973 --> 14:08.974
Save one for a kebab.

14:10.184 --> 14:11.768
Eccentric geniuses.

14:11.852 --> 14:12.978
Right.

14:13.061 --> 14:17.774
17, 18, 19, 20.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.526
How's that for trigonometry?

14:21.069 --> 14:22.279
We got there.

14:37.169 --> 14:38.170
Yes!

14:40.047 --> 14:43.091
-Fair play!
-Good on you.

14:43.967 --> 14:46.178
Next round is on us.

14:46.261 --> 14:47.471
Anything you like.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.057
-Three big boots of ale?
-This guy.

14:52.809 --> 14:56.146
Oi. How'd you know
all that stuff about Oxford?

14:57.314 --> 15:00.526
I dated a professor at Oxford.
And I listen more than I talk.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.530
I'll be right back.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.783
Oi.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.826
What a legend you are!

15:57.666 --> 15:59.585
Hard to forget a game like that.

16:00.627 --> 16:03.505
You know what will help?
Going to see the woman you love.

16:04.548 --> 16:06.216
Exactly. But it's clear to me

16:06.300 --> 16:09.011
that Coach Beard doesn't think
he's worthy of Jane.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.345
I know.

16:10.429 --> 16:14.850
Beard's self-esteem is so low,
he will need a pep talk to kill himself,

16:14.933 --> 16:17.686
and I would like to give that pep talk.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.271
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.067
Goddamn fucking shit!

16:25.903 --> 16:27.070
Is there a problem here?

16:27.154 --> 16:30.282
Yeah. This nail on your faux Persian
flea market coffee table

16:30.365 --> 16:31.491
just tore my pants.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.660
Sir, can I see your membership card,
please?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.833
My friends are in there.

16:42.336 --> 16:43.337
Goddamn it.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.175
I'm sure you know that
your trousers are ripped.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.347
They're designed that way.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.600
To make it easier
for people to kiss my ass.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.438
Be careful.
We have decency laws in England.

17:01.522 --> 17:02.648
You'll get arrested.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.108
I wasn't aware
the laws were so restrictive here.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.487
Oh, yeah. We're a repressed nation.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.656
One exposed arse can bring down
the monarchy itself.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.867
How dare you speak of
Prince Andrew that way.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.204
I could fix those for you.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.208
I live over there.

17:22.415 --> 17:23.836
In that pointy building?

17:24.795 --> 17:25.796
No.

17:49.361 --> 17:50.571
Take your trousers off.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.198
You're not in charge of me.

18:01.164 --> 18:03.333
I'll give you something to wear
in the meantime.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.679
People come and go from my life.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.807
I've always kept a pair of their trousers.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.769
This rack is like my memoirs.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.523
These should fit.

18:27.733 --> 18:29.067
Whose were these?

18:29.151 --> 18:30.402
An old lover.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.695
Where's he now?

18:31.778 --> 18:32.821
Dead.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.575
You dropped your keys.

18:43.207 --> 18:46.168
You ever look back on a relationship
and regret it had ended?

18:47.336 --> 18:48.420
Been doing it all day.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.715
I've loved every man in my life,

18:51.798 --> 18:55.010
but I don't think I regret a single one
of those relationships ending.

18:55.761 --> 18:59.056
In all my happiest memories, I'm single.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.893
That troubles me.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.027
Have you ever been in love?

19:15.489 --> 19:17.783
I mean, there's someone in my life now
who…

19:20.118 --> 19:22.871
maybe it's chemicals
or maybe it's pheromones, but…

19:25.040 --> 19:29.795
I wanna be with her all the time.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.632
Is that love, or do I just have a problem?

19:33.715 --> 19:35.133
Why can't it be both?

19:39.805 --> 19:40.889
Could you get that?

19:44.893 --> 19:46.144
It says, "Do not answer."

19:47.187 --> 19:48.438
It's a joke.

19:51.692 --> 19:54.194
Oi, babe, I'm here, but I forgot my keys.

19:55.946 --> 19:57.364
Who the fuck are you?

19:57.447 --> 19:58.490
I'm Beard.

19:59.283 --> 20:01.618
He's just a trouserless man
I met at Bones & Honey.

20:01.702 --> 20:02.953
What the fuck?

20:03.036 --> 20:05.205
Oi, shithead!

20:05.289 --> 20:08.625
I'm gonna punch
your fucking teeth out your face

20:08.709 --> 20:11.503
and feed 'em to your arsehole
like they're candy.

20:12.296 --> 20:13.297
Oh, shit.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.258
-You could've warned me.
-Don't mind him.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.759
He's just a little jealous.

20:19.178 --> 20:22.097
Open the fucking door.
You're a dead man.

20:23.724 --> 20:24.975
Run.

20:30.647 --> 20:31.815
Where the fuck is he?

20:57.841 --> 20:59.134
Nowhere to go.

21:45.639 --> 21:46.765
Oi!

22:09.371 --> 22:10.622
Still got it!

22:25.345 --> 22:27.514
Oi, he hasn't tapped in.

22:29.600 --> 22:32.436
We're not going anywhere until you tap in.

22:33.228 --> 22:35.939
Of course, of course, of course.
My pleasure.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.661
Excuse me, madam.

22:52.873 --> 22:55.250
Piss off, you fucking scrounger.

23:17.314 --> 23:18.315
Good evening, sir.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.360
Are you staying with us tonight?

23:21.443 --> 23:23.654
No. No, I am not.

23:23.737 --> 23:25.113
Well. Have a good evening.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.450
Could I please use the phone?

23:29.826 --> 23:32.287
The hotel phones are just for guests,
I'm afraid, sir.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.582
Okay then.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.378
-Could I please use your phone?
-My personal phone?

23:39.461 --> 23:42.464
Yes, I lost my phone and my wallet,
and I'm just trying to get back home.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.550
And what would you be using
my personal phone for, sir?

23:45.717 --> 23:46.718
Booking a cab.

23:46.802 --> 23:49.054
Nope. I'm not falling for that.

23:49.137 --> 23:50.681
I'm not trying to trick you.

23:50.764 --> 23:52.558
Exactly what a trickster would say.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.353
I would just go
through my own account, you know.

23:56.436 --> 23:59.273
That's how it starts, isn't it?
First you book a cab.

23:59.356 --> 24:01.733
Next thing I know,
you've geolinked my phone to your network

24:01.817 --> 24:05.362
and all of a sudden, you and fake Melania
have downloaded all my bank details

24:05.445 --> 24:07.197
and you're using my identity to shift

24:07.281 --> 24:09.199
more poppy seeds
to your own private island.

24:09.283 --> 24:11.201
No. Not tonight.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.453
I've been in this game too long now.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.998
-What game?
-You won't touch my phone.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.041
Within seconds,
you'll have my mother's maiden name,

24:18.125 --> 24:19.334
all my cryptocurrencies.

24:19.418 --> 24:20.836
Not that I have any.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.047
Next thing I know,
my hard drive is being confiscated by MI5

24:24.131 --> 24:26.675
for illegal images
that you've tricked me into downloading.

24:26.758 --> 24:29.094
Oh, no. You'll not make a fool of me.

24:29.178 --> 24:31.930
Not you.
Not a dead ringer for Dame Judi Dench.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.683
Not anyone. Shame on you, sir! Good night.

25:01.752 --> 25:03.045
Hello.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.301
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you guys.

25:10.886 --> 25:12.930
Just trying to get home
and I lost my phone.

25:14.097 --> 25:16.308
You guys are about to save my life.

25:20.187 --> 25:21.522
Ah, shit.

25:23.106 --> 25:24.691
Well, look who it isn't.

25:24.775 --> 25:26.902
Good to see you again, Mr. Tartt.

25:27.528 --> 25:30.364
Sorry about before. Why don't I let you
get back to what you were doing--

25:30.989 --> 25:32.533
It's okay. There's no rush.

25:35.369 --> 25:36.370
I tell you what, lads.

25:36.453 --> 25:41.083
Why don't we teach Coach here,
in his magic trousers…

25:42.668 --> 25:44.753
exactly what football's all about.

25:45.629 --> 25:47.297
Because it doesn't happen on the pitch.

25:47.381 --> 25:48.674
No.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.051
It happens on the street.

25:52.928 --> 25:53.929
You get me?

25:55.138 --> 25:56.473
Or…

25:57.474 --> 25:58.475
Get him!

26:00.561 --> 26:01.812
Come on!

26:17.286 --> 26:19.663
Well, it looks like
Beard's done for, doesn't it?

26:19.746 --> 26:23.500
Gary, part of me thinks Beard
really wanted to get beat up tonight.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.085
Absolutely, Thierry.

26:25.169 --> 26:26.879
Clearly he'd rather punish himself

26:26.962 --> 26:29.965
than accept the love and support
of the people around him.

26:30.048 --> 26:33.510
I'm beginning to think
Coach Beard hates himself.

26:33.594 --> 26:35.053
Shut up, Thierry Henry.

26:38.473 --> 26:39.725
Yeah!

26:45.272 --> 26:46.231
Huh, mate?

26:48.609 --> 26:51.195
-Punch him again.
-Prick!

26:54.364 --> 26:55.866
You're nothing!

27:13.967 --> 27:14.885
Gotcha!

27:17.429 --> 27:18.680
Stay down!

27:23.810 --> 27:25.020
Oh, shit.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.733
Oh, shit.

27:30.526 --> 27:32.569
-I told you to stay--
-Fellas!

27:34.154 --> 27:35.531
How about we call this a draw?

27:43.956 --> 27:45.457
You had to push it, didn't ya?

27:46.917 --> 27:48.460
Say good night, son.

28:08.689 --> 28:10.607
Ah, man. Come on.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.026
Nothing happened.
She was just gonna fix my pants.

28:13.110 --> 28:15.863
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

28:18.031 --> 28:19.867
You left these at our flat.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.787
Been trying to find ya.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.378
Well, that's nice.

28:34.423 --> 28:36.758
No, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

28:36.842 --> 28:38.385
Mary explained what happened.

28:39.303 --> 28:41.680
The truth is we're having a baby.

28:42.598 --> 28:46.268
And it's made me realize
how precious she is to me,

28:46.351 --> 28:50.731
and the thought that she was
cheating on me was just too much.

28:50.814 --> 28:51.815
Uh-huh.

28:51.899 --> 28:53.483
But I also realize that

28:53.567 --> 28:56.695
maybe I'm more paranoid than most
when it comes to that.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.572
'Cause I used to cheat in the past.

28:59.239 --> 29:01.283
But I've really worked on it.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.869
-I'm in a really good place now.
-That's great.

29:03.952 --> 29:04.953
Yeah, cheers.

29:05.037 --> 29:08.582
Anyway, I just wanted to give you
your stuff back.

29:09.750 --> 29:12.002
Mary says she's keeping
your trousers though.

29:12.669 --> 29:14.796
It's kind of her thing.

29:15.464 --> 29:16.882
She said you can keep those.

29:18.133 --> 29:20.260
-Thank you.
-Well, they look good on you.

29:21.220 --> 29:22.387
I know.

29:22.971 --> 29:25.265
Sorry about the shit game today.

29:26.183 --> 29:30.604
And I'm not even a Richmond fan,
but, mamma mia, that was tough to watch.

29:37.569 --> 29:38.779
I think you dropped those.

29:41.156 --> 29:42.157
All right.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.119
You be lucky, yeah?

29:47.371 --> 29:48.664
I'm trying.

29:55.921 --> 30:00.384
Oh, no.
No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.428
Oh, no. No, no, no.

30:08.559 --> 30:10.060
I love you too. I love you too!

30:11.061 --> 30:15.816
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No! No! No!

30:54.521 --> 30:56.607
Oi, samurai!

30:56.690 --> 31:00.777
We got a limo
We got a limo

31:01.445 --> 31:03.363
-Get in! Come on!
-Look, we got a limo!

31:04.740 --> 31:06.575
They were really nice guys in the end.

31:06.658 --> 31:08.202
And so bad at pool.

31:08.285 --> 31:09.703
We told them who we really were,

31:09.786 --> 31:12.539
and they still invited us
to their country estate for Easter.

31:12.623 --> 31:14.416
I don't know what I'm gonna wear.

31:15.000 --> 31:19.171
We made so much money off them,
we treated ourself to a limo!

31:19.838 --> 31:21.965
-Where to, sir?
-Anywhere you want.

31:22.049 --> 31:23.926
This night will never end.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.385
Home, please.

31:32.601 --> 31:34.186
Thanks for a wicked night.

31:34.978 --> 31:36.730
You're gonna go to this address

31:37.272 --> 31:40.484
and you're gonna tell Renee
that Beard said it was okay.

31:42.361 --> 31:43.362
Thanks, guys.

31:45.155 --> 31:49.284
Just one Cornetto

31:49.368 --> 31:51.995
Give it to me

31:52.079 --> 31:55.499
Delicious ice cream

31:55.582 --> 31:59.044
Of Italy

32:17.938 --> 32:18.939
No.

32:21.233 --> 32:22.234
No.

32:26.446 --> 32:29.825
No!

33:48.570 --> 33:49.863
Are you there, God?

33:50.531 --> 33:52.366
It's me, Margaret's little boy.

33:54.243 --> 33:57.454
Longtime listener, first-time caller.
And I know you're probably busy,

33:57.538 --> 34:01.416
'cause you got bigger fish to multiply
and then fry.

34:02.793 --> 34:05.295
As you do. But there's this girl.

34:06.880 --> 34:10.884
There's this woman, Jane.

34:12.010 --> 34:14.763
Last name Payne. P-A-Y-N-E.

34:14.847 --> 34:17.349
But you probably know that,
but if you wanted to look her up.

34:20.226 --> 34:22.980
And I care for her, deeply.

34:24.565 --> 34:27.067
I could've been with her tonight,
but I ended up with you.

34:32.531 --> 34:35.449
And I am under no illusions
that she could solve what ails me.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.871
But when I'm with her,
the world just feels…

34:42.123 --> 34:43.625
more interesting.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.362
What is this place?

35:15.073 --> 35:17.159
Here. 2-3-7.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.623
-Well, knock then.
-Why don't you knock?

35:22.706 --> 35:23.707
Just knock.

35:27.419 --> 35:28.420
What?

35:28.921 --> 35:30.172
Are you Renee?

35:30.255 --> 35:31.423
Who's asking?

35:32.925 --> 35:34.176
Coach Beard sent us.

35:42.142 --> 35:43.393
Turn 'em on.

35:45.604 --> 35:47.022
Walk this way.

35:47.481 --> 35:48.690
Go on.

35:51.735 --> 35:52.736
Come on.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.238
Come on.

36:13.382 --> 36:14.424
Oh, my God.

36:14.508 --> 36:15.759
It's beautiful.

36:15.843 --> 36:17.052
Is that heaven?

36:18.220 --> 36:20.848
No. That's Nelson Road.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.402
Wave to the crowd! Wave to the crowd!

37:03.599 --> 37:05.058
Yeah!

37:12.107 --> 37:13.275
Fuck yes!

38:41.738 --> 38:42.865
Try this on.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.296
-They do food here?
-For me, yeah.

40:41.775 --> 40:44.778
-Where the fuck is he?
-If Beard's not coming, I'll get coffees.

40:44.862 --> 40:47.072
Wait. Now, hold on a second.
He'll be here.

40:47.155 --> 40:48.699
Beard's like the mailman, you know?

40:48.782 --> 40:50.826
He always delivers
and he looks great in shorts.

40:52.661 --> 40:53.829
Morning, fellas.

40:53.912 --> 40:56.206
-What'd I tell you?
-Here you go.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.043
Flat white. Coffee, black.
Peppermint latte.

41:01.003 --> 41:02.004
Cheers.

41:03.338 --> 41:04.339
Thank you, Coach.

41:05.382 --> 41:06.466
You…

41:08.552 --> 41:10.387
Everything all right, you know?

41:10.470 --> 41:14.641
Yeah. Just slept too late.
Must've fell off the bed.

41:14.725 --> 41:16.977
Oh, right. Yeah, no.
That's a thing.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.062
Okay, who's ready to watch
yesterday's match?

41:19.146 --> 41:21.523
-No. No.
-I've actually watched it plenty.

41:21.607 --> 41:24.818
-Don't think we should. We don't need to.
-Hey, now, look. I know, I know, I know.

41:24.902 --> 41:27.821
-But this is how we get better, all right?
-Fine.

41:27.905 --> 41:32.576
'Cause sometimes, every once in
a blue moon, there is a game so awful, so…

41:33.285 --> 41:34.745
Dog shit?

41:34.828 --> 41:35.954
Haunting?

41:36.038 --> 41:38.540
A catastrophe of epic proportions.

41:38.624 --> 41:42.002
That the only way to watch it back
is at ten times the speed

41:42.085 --> 41:45.214
and with the Benny Hill theme music
playing under it. Here we go.
