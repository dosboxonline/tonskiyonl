No, no. I'm-I'm not putting
pressure on you.

08:41.354 --> 08:44.024
I think you should just go be yourself

08:44.107 --> 08:47.235
and show those Lundy suits that
you are more than a foreman.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.320
"More than a foreman."

08:50.405 --> 08:52.365
-You're a five-man.
-Ha-ha!

08:52.449 --> 08:54.576
-(chuckles): That was very cute.
-(chuckling)

08:54.659 --> 08:56.369
I know.
I might be sleep-deprived,

08:56.453 --> 08:57.787
but Mama's still got it.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.623
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay here alone

09:00.707 --> 09:01.916
-with the kids tonight?
-Yeah.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.043
You don't want to splurge
and get a sitter?

09:03.126 --> 09:05.337
No.
No, I don't want to splurge.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.005
<i>(crying over monitor)</i>

09:07.088 --> 09:08.882
Seriously, leave while you can.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.634
-All right, wish me luck.
-I would, but you don't need it.

09:11.718 --> 09:14.095
<i>-(crying continues)</i>
-Mm.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.181
(exhales)

09:19.893 --> 09:21.061
No new e-mails?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.479
Nope.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.023
How long does it take
to talk to your partners?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.609
-(fussing) Maybe the guy was
just giving me lip service.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.694
No.
Babe, you're amazing.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.322
They loved you.
You're gonna get the job.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.033
And I think you should let yourself
feel excited about it.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.951
Yeah, I-I would be excited

09:37.035 --> 09:38.828
not to have to dip into our savings,

09:38.912 --> 09:40.455
I'll tell you that much.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.957
(exhales) But you know
what Terrence was telling me?

09:43.041 --> 09:46.252
He was saying that not only
do they offer stock options

09:46.336 --> 09:49.297
but they also-- they have an entire room

09:49.381 --> 09:51.049
dedicated to cereal.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.967
-That's perfect for you.
-I know.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.219
But, look,

09:54.302 --> 09:56.721
c-can we just-- can we just not tell Kevin

09:56.805 --> 09:59.599
about any of this stuff until
we see how this all plays out?

09:59.683 --> 10:02.560
-Okay.
-'Kay. (exhales)

10:02.644 --> 10:04.896
But, babe, he's family.
We can tell him anything.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.106
Yeah, I know.
I just--

10:06.189 --> 10:07.774
If I have to tell him that I lost my job,

10:07.857 --> 10:11.277
I'd rather have a new job
lined up already.

10:11.361 --> 10:12.987
-Okay.
-Yeah.

10:13.988 --> 10:15.949
I wanted to make something special

10:16.032 --> 10:17.951
for what I thought was gonna be your, uh,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.202
last dinner.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.121
But just so I can plan,

10:21.204 --> 10:22.706
how many more dinners we thinking, Mom?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.333
Oh, I'm not sure.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.918
Uh, don't put

10:27.002 --> 10:29.713
too many Scotch bonnet peppers
in that curry.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.589
Not everyone can handle the heat.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.883
I can handle the heat.

10:34.968 --> 10:37.721
Hey, Tess, help me set the table.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.764
I'm gonna go over Alex's for dinner.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.933
Oh, not tonight.
We're gonna have a family dinner.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.352
But you can go over her house
another night.

10:44.436 --> 10:46.062
Oh, my God.
I told you.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.605
It's not "her."
It's "their."

10:47.689 --> 10:50.150
Sorry, sorry.
Their house.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.527
I just got to get used
to using a plural pronoun

10:52.610 --> 10:54.529
in a singular way, you know?

10:54.612 --> 10:56.948
It's actually not that difficult.

10:57.032 --> 11:01.036
We've used "they" singularly
throughout history really.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.329
"Somebody left their umbrella
at the office."

11:03.413 --> 11:04.831
-(doorbell rings)
-See? Simple.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.000
Yup. Right. Simple.

11:09.085 --> 11:11.087
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.423
-Hey, Mrs. Pearson.
-BETH: Hey.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.758
Hey, Mrs. Clarke.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.843
Uh, is Randall here?

11:16.926 --> 11:18.470
I got to talk to him about a work thing.

11:18.553 --> 11:20.555
Yeah, he's outside on his porch.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.770
Okay.
I'll just wait here, I guess.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.857
(door opens)

11:30.940 --> 11:32.859
Wow.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.737
This your little hideout, huh?

11:35.820 --> 11:37.822
Not hiding, youngster.

11:37.906 --> 11:41.576
Just, uh, carving out
a little space for myself.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.871
There's a lot of strong,
opinionated women inside.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.873
But now that you're here,

11:46.956 --> 11:49.084
we are evening out the gender scales.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.628
You, me and my new basil plant.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.047
Your basil's a guy?

11:54.130 --> 11:55.548
Actually, basil plants
don't have a gender.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.634
They're pollinated
by small flying insects.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.595
But also, yes, he's a dude.

12:00.679 --> 12:02.847
Uh...
(chuckles)

12:04.432 --> 12:05.809
You all right?

12:05.892 --> 12:07.352
Something on your mind?

12:08.436 --> 12:10.438
Um...

12:11.564 --> 12:13.108
Oh, okay, I'll-I'll just say it.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.236
Um, I-I... I kind of need some advice.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.655
You're coming to me for advice?

12:20.824 --> 12:23.702
You see, that's what I'm talking about.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.704
My daughters never come to me for advice,

12:25.787 --> 12:28.873
and I'm so full
of wonderful advice to share.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.500
Pull up a chair, young brother.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.293
(Randall groans)

12:32.377 --> 12:34.462
(sighs)
What is it?

12:34.546 --> 12:37.841
School, career,
book recommendation, women?

12:37.924 --> 12:40.135
You're dating my daughter,
so it better not be women.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.511
-It's not women.
-(chuckles softly)

12:44.180 --> 12:47.308
No, it's, uh...
it's actually about Janelle,

12:47.392 --> 12:49.436
-my-my kid.
-Okay.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.815
Her mom wants to come back into her life.

12:54.899 --> 12:56.693
Mm.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.529
Mm.
Okay.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.073
How you feel about that?

13:02.157 --> 13:03.950
(Malik sighs)

13:05.035 --> 13:08.079
Well, when I had her, Jennifer's...

13:08.163 --> 13:11.541
-Uh, J-Jennifer's Janelle's mom.
-Okay.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.210
Her parents wanted
to put the baby up for adoption.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.421
It got real ugly there for a minute.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.132
You know, me and my parents had
to fight like hell

13:19.215 --> 13:20.633
for full custody.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.720
But a couple of days ago,

13:23.803 --> 13:25.889
Jennifer reached out, and...

13:25.972 --> 13:28.308
now she wants to be involved.

13:29.851 --> 13:31.561
I-I mean, I don't... I don't know. I...

13:31.644 --> 13:33.897
I don't have a problem with it,

13:33.980 --> 13:36.274
but I know my parents wouldn't have it.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.069
I don't know.
I-I guess...

13:39.152 --> 13:41.529
I guess I just thought with
everything you've been through,

13:41.613 --> 13:43.406
you'd have some thoughts on it?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.869
It's a tough thing to give advice about.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.790
You know, no two situations
are exactly the same, so...

13:51.873 --> 13:54.668
-(quietly): Right.
-(sighs)

13:54.751 --> 13:59.297
It was a big hole for me,
not knowing my birth mother.

14:00.548 --> 14:03.968
And I finally just got some answers at 40.

14:04.052 --> 14:06.137
(Randall sighs)

14:06.221 --> 14:09.057
So I guess,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.601
if you're asking about my experience,

14:11.685 --> 14:13.186
I would say...

14:15.522 --> 14:17.524
...if I had a chance to know my mom,

14:17.607 --> 14:20.068
it would have saved me
a lot of time in therapy.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.949
Okay.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.034
I know what I'm gonna do.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.994
And if this does not work out,

14:30.078 --> 14:33.081
I will be spending a lot of time
here with you and your basil.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.084
Hey, man, Isaac and I
will appreciate the company.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.169
Oh, God, you named him.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.421
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

14:39.504 --> 14:42.924
-Who's here?
-KATE: Kevin!

14:43.008 --> 14:44.718
-Hey! Come on in.
-Hey.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.845
What's up?
How you doing, handsome?

14:46.928 --> 14:48.054
KATE:
How are you? Hi.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.973
-Thank you.
-Hi.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.642
(indistinct chatter)

14:52.726 --> 14:56.187
Let me get my first selfie
with my new niece here.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.814
There we go.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.233
Wow.
Your house looks so nice.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.943
Uh, it is not me.
It's our magical nanny.

15:02.027 --> 15:03.403
I just do whatever she tells me.

15:03.486 --> 15:05.155
Here, let's get you guys settled.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.699
-And take her. I have the babies in the back.
-Thank you.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.284
-Thank you so much.
-Hi, pretty.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.119
Geez, what, are you opening a store?

15:11.202 --> 15:12.829
Yeah, I know, right?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.956
Every single person
I ever worked with got us something.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.791
These right here--
these are called "WubbaNubs."

15:16.875 --> 15:18.752
-Glenn Close sent those over.
-Yeah.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.046
And I got a cabinet full
of diapers from Jessica Alba.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.548
But the best, the best,
my friend, I saved for you.

15:23.631 --> 15:28.470
These are Cohibas
from Leonardo DiCaprio's...

15:28.553 --> 15:29.929
manager.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.432
-If we must.
-I think we must. (phone buzzes)

15:32.515 --> 15:34.392
And I'm looking forward
to catching up with you, you know?

15:34.476 --> 15:36.061
I want to hear everything
that's going on in your life.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.355
I want to hear how many ounces
the baby is eating,

15:38.438 --> 15:40.148
if you guys are planning
on sleep training,

15:40.231 --> 15:41.941
and if you are, when are you
planning on doing that.

15:42.025 --> 15:44.027
What are the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.487
What the hell has happened to me?

15:45.570 --> 15:48.031
Anyway, are you, uh...?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.575
Tobe, you coming?

15:51.659 --> 15:53.745
Yup. Yeah.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.041
BRAD: Well, I got to put
a little pressure on him.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.959
See if we can get some things
moving down there.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.836
Town's driving him a little nutty.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.463
I swear if I don't get Waterstone's B.O.Q.

16:03.546 --> 16:05.131
by the end of the week, we're moving on.

16:05.215 --> 16:07.175
That's a bill of quantity.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.135
MICHAEL: You've been complaining
about that guy for months.

16:09.219 --> 16:10.845
The only reason
I still do business with him is

16:10.929 --> 16:13.431
he's got seats behind the Pirates dugout
at Three Rivers.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.600
Now, that's a good reason.

16:15.684 --> 16:18.269
You know, Jack is a huge fan
of the Pirates.

16:18.353 --> 16:20.146
You should tell them
your Willie Stargell story.

16:20.230 --> 16:24.567
-Hmm.
-Yeah, come on, tell 'em. It's a great story.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.529
Okay, um... Willie Stargell.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.739
-Mm.
-(clears throat)

16:29.823 --> 16:32.117
So, I was at Rudy's,

16:32.200 --> 16:34.869
uh, the night he hit his 400th home run.

16:34.953 --> 16:38.540
And all of a sudden, in walks Willie.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.583
And the whole place just lights up.

16:40.667 --> 16:44.295
And so, I tried to make my way
over to say congratulations,

16:44.379 --> 16:47.173
and the guy's just-- he's getting mobbed.

16:47.257 --> 16:51.344
I didn't want to hound him,
so I just let it go.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.972
End of the night,
I'm walking out to my car.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.058
There in the parking lot is Willie.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.518
Hmm.

16:58.601 --> 17:01.229
So I figured, this is my chance.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.607
Walk up to him, and say, uh,
"Congratulations.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.402
You know, I'm-I'm a huge fan."
All that.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.529
And as we're there talking,

17:09.612 --> 17:11.781
he tells me he can't find his car,
so I say to him,

17:11.865 --> 17:13.450
"You know, Willie,
it's getting a little late.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.909
How about I just give you a ride home?"

17:14.993 --> 17:16.619
You gave Willie Stargell a ride home?

17:16.703 --> 17:18.079
No.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.664
No, just then, a stretch limo pulls up,

17:19.748 --> 17:21.124
he jumps in, takes off.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.792
-(soft chuckles)
-He never had his car.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.210
That's why he couldn't find his car.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.629
-He never had his car.
-(laughter)

17:26.713 --> 17:28.465
But I did get to stand in the parking lot

17:28.548 --> 17:31.384
and talk to Pops
for a good ten minutes while

17:31.468 --> 17:33.762
-We looked for that car.
-That's great. -Yeah.

17:33.845 --> 17:35.513
-Mm.
-To Pops. -Pops.

17:35.597 --> 17:38.099
-Pops.
-Pops. (chuckles)

17:38.183 --> 17:39.684
(piano plays soft music)

17:43.646 --> 17:46.066
Wonder if I'll get dad bod.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.234
What is dad bod anyway?

17:48.318 --> 17:50.153
Is that skinny fat, or is that, like, uh,

17:50.236 --> 17:52.572
pear shape, or... who knows anymore?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.116
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
I'm down with dad bod.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.372
Man, I've been thinking a lot

18:00.455 --> 18:02.540
about this whole
fatherhood thing, you know?

18:04.000 --> 18:07.295
You know, like, things
I want for my kids-- our kids--

18:07.379 --> 18:11.633
and, uh, I really want 'em
to all grow up together,

18:11.716 --> 18:13.718
like one big crew, you know?

18:13.802 --> 18:16.721
Camp together, go on vacations together.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.350
This may be a total fantasy,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.769
but, um, there's this property in Malibu

18:22.852 --> 18:24.854
that I've-I've sort of been
Internet stalking.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.815
I was thinking
about buying it now, and then,

18:26.898 --> 18:28.400
later on down the road-- I don't know--

18:28.483 --> 18:31.027
build a... a compound for us or something.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.948
Yeah, I don't think Malibu is my scene.

18:35.031 --> 18:37.575
-No?
-No.

18:37.659 --> 18:39.202
Yeah, you're probably right.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.620
You know, the kids'll end up surfing

18:40.704 --> 18:43.164
and become stoners and then...

18:43.248 --> 18:44.374
Anyway, that's all for later.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.167
You know, I just... I like thinking

18:46.251 --> 18:47.293
about that kind of stuff.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.878
But enough about me.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.547
Enough-enough rambling.
What about you?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.216
How are things with you?
How's, uh... how's work?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.844
-(door opens)
-MADISON: Sushi's here!

18:55.927 --> 18:58.346
Great.
Let's eat.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.848
Okay.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.308
There you go.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.185
-Mm-hmm.
-There you go.

19:04.269 --> 19:06.438
Oh, Miss Bethany, you have certainly

19:06.521 --> 19:09.149
-outdone yourself this evening.
-Oh, it's nothing.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.568
It didn't take too long
to grind the spices by hand.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.945
And then after that,
I just ironed the napkins

19:14.029 --> 19:16.865
and broke out the wedding china,
so it was no biggie.

19:16.948 --> 19:19.200
So, how was everybody's day?

19:19.284 --> 19:21.411
Tess?

19:21.494 --> 19:23.747
Same as yesterday and the day before that

19:23.830 --> 19:25.707
because we're here all the time.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.084
What about you, Malik?

19:28.168 --> 19:30.170
You're not here all the time.

19:33.840 --> 19:37.927
Um, you know, same ol' same ol'.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.179
Life and stuff.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.430
I have something to share.

19:42.098 --> 19:45.935
My new basil plant seems
to be thriving on the porch.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.230
Must be keeping those pH levels
nice and steady.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.524
Or maybe it's the new soil I picked up.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.777
You know, the key is granular aggregates.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.238
H-Hey, little mamas,
no phones at the dinner table.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.866
At my school, the children
had to leave their phones

19:59.949 --> 20:04.162
in their lockers during class
and other important events.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.290
Yup, that's why I have a new phone policy.

20:07.374 --> 20:09.793
Um...

20:09.876 --> 20:12.420
phones in.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.714
-But, Mom...
-In.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.387
You, too, Mr. Same Ol' Same Ol'.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.598
Okay.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.935
But I'm a councilman.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.978
What if there's an emergency?

20:29.062 --> 20:31.064
I'll just let the city burn.

20:33.108 --> 20:34.901
KATE:
You like cigars?

20:34.984 --> 20:37.445
MADISON: Well, Natasha
has all four kids down back there.

20:37.529 --> 20:40.281
Nick spit up in my ear.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.867
-Ooh.
-I have swimmer's ear, but with baby vomit.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.911
-Wow, spoken like a true mom.
-(gasps)

20:44.994 --> 20:46.454
I can't believe we're both moms.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.581
I know.
This is gonna sound awkward,

20:48.665 --> 20:50.083
but thank you
for sleeping with my brother.

20:50.166 --> 20:52.293
-MADISON: Ah, anytime.
-(Kate laughs)

20:53.753 --> 20:55.755
And thank you for inviting us.

20:55.839 --> 20:57.841
-Yes.
-This is awesome. -Mm-hmm.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.467
-Kev, oh, my goodness.
-Yeah. -Mm.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.678
But I think that you bought
enough for, like, an army.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.847
Yeah, I figured we all deserve a treat.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.348
Well, really, thank you.
It's so nice.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.683
-Yeah, thank you.
-Oh, come on.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.768
Anything for you guys, always.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.478
Let's have a toast?

21:10.562 --> 21:11.938
Yes.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.565
MADISON:
To the first

21:13.648 --> 21:15.650
get-together of a new generation.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.527
May they one day care about each other

21:17.610 --> 21:19.863
the way that I do for each of you.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.156
Aw.

21:21.239 --> 21:24.075
Crap.
I'm leaking.

21:24.159 --> 21:27.495
-Uh, don't judge me.
-(Kate laughing)

21:31.332 --> 21:33.335
Wow, so, the twins have been
really quiet all night.

21:33.418 --> 21:34.753
KEVIN:
Yeah, it's the SNOO.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.338
It's a miracle machine.
But you guys know.

21:36.421 --> 21:38.256
-You have one.
-KATE: Uh, no. We rented the one

21:38.340 --> 21:40.383
for Jack, but, uh,
we're not gonna do it this time.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.218
-TOBY: Yeah, we're just gonna go old-fashioned.
-KEVIN: Really?

21:42.302 --> 21:44.346
You know, I-I rock Hailey with my foot.

21:44.429 --> 21:46.848
What?
you don't have a SNOO?

21:46.931 --> 21:49.351
You got to get a SNOO.
I'll get you a SNOO right now.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.311
-TOBY: Kev, it's all right.
-No, no, no.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.021
It's easy.
It's two seconds.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.815
It's two seconds.
Besides, I didn't get Hailey

21:55.899 --> 21:57.108
-a baby gift yet.
-KATE: We don't need one.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.860
And your lives
are stressful enough as it is.

21:58.943 --> 22:00.028
Okay, it's the least I can do.

22:00.111 --> 22:03.073
Just get this real quick.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.324
Did you tell him?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.201
(scoffs)
Yeah, of course you did,

22:06.284 --> 22:07.744
'cause you guys
tell each other everything.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.829
-Tell me what?
-That's what this is all about.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.206
-KATE: Toby.
-That's why the big sushi spread

22:11.289 --> 22:13.208
and the free SNOO
and the compound in Malibu.

22:13.291 --> 22:16.961
Don't worry, Kev.
I'll find another job.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.257
You lost your job?

22:25.428 --> 22:28.973
Yeah, but it's okay,
'cause he's about to get

22:29.057 --> 22:30.141
a really great job offer.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.559
He had an interview that we feel

22:31.643 --> 22:32.769
really good about.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.479
-Okay.
-Actually, we don't.

22:34.562 --> 22:36.815
I di... I didn't get it.
I found out I didn't get it.

22:36.898 --> 22:40.110
Um, and the job market
is really terrible right now.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.654
There doesn't seem to be much
light at the end of this tunnel,

22:42.737 --> 22:44.072
so I think I'm just gonna fill myself

22:44.155 --> 22:46.658
with as much of this
expensive sushi as possible

22:46.741 --> 22:49.786
until it's army rations for us
from here on out.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.081
MADISON:
Screw the dress.

22:53.164 --> 22:54.708
The entire country's in sweatpants.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.292
What'd I miss?

23:04.384 --> 23:06.761
-Last shrimp?
-Mm-mm.

23:06.845 --> 23:09.389
If I have one more bite,
I'm gonna have to undo my belt,

23:09.472 --> 23:12.183
-and I don't know you two well enough.
-(laughter)

23:12.267 --> 23:13.810
Who knew Pearson had a personality?

23:13.893 --> 23:15.145
Until tonight, we thought you were all

23:15.228 --> 23:17.731
facial hair and flannels.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.068
-Credit card roulette?
-What's that?

23:22.152 --> 23:23.611
We each put in a credit card.

23:23.695 --> 23:27.532
Whichever one the waitress picks,
that guy pays the bill.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.535
Yeah, but Jack, uh,
shouldn't have to put in for that.

23:30.618 --> 23:33.747
He can't expense booze
as an office supply, like you morons.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.165
(laughter)

23:35.248 --> 23:37.625
No, I-I'm in.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.918
Yeah, I'm in.

23:39.002 --> 23:40.045
Look, I just got a Mastercard.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.421
-You sure?
-Attaboy.

23:42.589 --> 23:44.299
All right.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.592
There you go.

23:45.675 --> 23:46.760
Pick one.

23:49.429 --> 23:53.266
(chuckling):
Oh, new guy buys.

23:53.350 --> 23:55.393
-Great. -Thanks.
-Thanks, Jack.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.437
Yeah, thanks, Jack.

23:58.521 --> 23:59.939
Well, they're fools, Toby.

24:00.023 --> 24:02.567
Obviously, you know, any company
would be lucky to have you.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.569
It's just, it's a weird time
right now, you know.

24:04.652 --> 24:06.029
The economy's all over the place,

24:06.112 --> 24:08.865
and these things have a way
of working themselves out.

24:08.948 --> 24:11.451
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.036
-(baby fussing)
-NATASHA: Don't mean to interrupt.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.704
Franny's fussy.
I think she's still hungry.

24:14.788 --> 24:16.539
-Oh, I'll just feed her here.
-Okay.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.713
I'm just gonna reach
for the soy sauce, FYI.

24:23.797 --> 24:25.215
-It's kind of close to your left feeder.
-(Kevin laughs)

24:25.298 --> 24:27.509
I don't care.
We're all family.

24:27.592 --> 24:29.260
Exactly.
We're all family.

24:29.344 --> 24:30.804
And if you guys need anything
to tide you over

24:30.887 --> 24:34.391
until, Toby, you're back on your feet,
you let me know.

24:34.474 --> 24:36.142
We're good, thanks.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.440
Maybe I could go back to work.

24:42.524 --> 24:44.609
I wanted to eventually anyway.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.904
Yeah, I-I don't think
that's the-the best solution.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.407
Why not?
I finally got my degree.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.866
Kate, just realistically speaking,

24:51.950 --> 24:54.285
salary-wise, I would still have to work,

24:54.369 --> 24:58.248
and then we would need childcare, so...

25:00.792 --> 25:04.170
Well, I mean, you could
bring the kids over here.

25:04.254 --> 25:07.090
You know?
We could get another nanny or a teacher.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.134
-Bring 'em over here. -Yeah.
-Could be like our own

25:09.217 --> 25:10.677
-private little day care.
-There you go.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.554
-Exactly.
-They'd be like siblings.

25:12.637 --> 25:13.722
Yeah, they'd all be together, you know.

25:13.805 --> 25:15.849
-I don't know.
-Oh, why not? Come on.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.143
Listen, they'll learn how to, uh...
how to share, right?

25:18.226 --> 25:20.478
They'll learn how to fight,
they'll eat paste together.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.188
We could get a special aid for Jack...

25:22.272 --> 25:26.234
Damn it, Kevin, just stop.
Just stop.

25:26.317 --> 25:29.404
All right, I don't need you
paying for my kids' lives. Okay?

25:34.409 --> 25:36.911
Toby, man, I wasn't
trying to be disrespectful.

25:36.995 --> 25:39.205
I'm just saying, you know, I...

25:39.289 --> 25:41.583
This job that I have,
I make a ridiculous amount of money,

25:41.666 --> 25:45.253
it's stupid money and, you know,
if I could help you out

25:45.337 --> 25:46.921
with it, then-then it wouldn't
be so stupid.

25:47.005 --> 25:50.175
Do you realize how
condescending that sounds?

25:50.258 --> 25:52.218
To make it seem like I'm doing you a favor

25:52.302 --> 25:54.471
taking your handout?

25:54.554 --> 25:56.848
Kevin, I have a career, all right?

25:56.931 --> 25:59.768
20 years' experience;
I can take care of my own family.

25:59.851 --> 26:01.936
That's the whole point.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.397
We're all family.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.483
To me, it's all <i>our</i> money.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.319
No, see-see, you are a family,

26:09.402 --> 26:11.780
and we are a family.

26:11.863 --> 26:14.908
We-We're a normal family, all right,

26:14.991 --> 26:17.535
w-with hand-me-down baby gear
and not enough money.

26:17.619 --> 26:20.622
And you are a family
from some alternate universe,

26:20.705 --> 26:23.792
with platters of sushi and too much money,

26:23.875 --> 26:26.419
and some nanny who does
all the hard work and magically

26:26.503 --> 26:28.755
brings the babies to Madison
when they're hungry.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.298
Okay, hold on a second,
you can come after me,

26:30.382 --> 26:32.133
but not-not Madison.
She's doing an amazing job.

26:32.217 --> 26:35.970
I know she is, I know that.
Sorry.

26:37.931 --> 26:41.226
(baby crying)

26:42.811 --> 26:45.188
That's Hailey.
I'll be right back.

26:54.864 --> 26:56.157
Mmm.

26:56.241 --> 26:58.326
Pretty good.

26:59.744 --> 27:02.706
Could have used a little bit
more Scotch bonnet pepper,

27:02.789 --> 27:04.207
but pretty good.

27:06.626 --> 27:09.671
Well, I think it's delicious.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.089
(phone chimes)

27:11.172 --> 27:13.633
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can I get that?

27:13.717 --> 27:15.510
I think that's my phone.
It might be about Janelle.

27:15.593 --> 27:16.928
-Yeah, of course. Go ahead.
-Thank you.

27:17.012 --> 27:19.431
Oh, so he can go on his phone,
but I can't?

27:19.514 --> 27:22.267
No. If you want to have a baby,
you can use your phone, too.

27:22.350 --> 27:23.685
Did you just tell our 13-year-old daughter

27:23.768 --> 27:25.103
to have a baby?

27:25.186 --> 27:27.856
TESS:
Well, I'm expecting a text from Alex,

27:27.939 --> 27:29.065
so I should be able to look at my phone.

27:29.149 --> 27:30.692
Honey, I know Alex is your best friend,

27:30.775 --> 27:32.110
but you can text her after dinner.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.611
-It's not that serious.
-Oh, my God, how many times

27:33.695 --> 27:35.196
do I have to tell you?

27:35.280 --> 27:36.489
Alex is a "they."

27:36.573 --> 27:38.033
And they're not just

27:38.116 --> 27:39.659
my best friend, we're together.

27:41.411 --> 27:43.496
What, y... do you mean like a couple?

27:43.580 --> 27:45.915
TESS:
Yeah, Mom, like a couple.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.501
I didn't know that.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.003
Did you know that?

27:50.086 --> 27:51.546
-Uh-uh.
-(phone chimes)

27:53.381 --> 27:55.216
Why are you getting
so many texts from Jennifer?

27:56.301 --> 27:58.011
Uh...

28:00.555 --> 28:02.098
Okay, what's going on?

28:02.182 --> 28:03.767
Why do you two keep looking at each other?

28:03.850 --> 28:05.602
MALIK:
Okay, look, here's the deal.

28:05.685 --> 28:08.688
Jennifer wants to be back
in Janelle's life.

28:08.772 --> 28:10.440
BETH:
Um...

28:10.523 --> 28:13.943
may I ask how long you and Alex

28:14.027 --> 28:15.403
have-have been together?

28:15.487 --> 28:17.155
-Three weeks.
-Three weeks?

28:17.238 --> 28:18.990
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah, you keep saying that.

28:19.074 --> 28:22.744
-And you weren't gonna tell me?
-No, no, I was. I was, after dinner.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.038
-I knew you'd react like this.
-BETH: What? React like what?

28:25.121 --> 28:26.539
I'm not reacting like anything.
I just don't understand

28:26.623 --> 28:28.291
why you didn't think you could tell me.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.543
-But you already told Randall.
-RANDALL: He did, and I told him

28:30.627 --> 28:33.213
-about my experience not knowing my mother.
-Oh, did you?

28:33.296 --> 28:35.590
-Is that a part of your mentor program?
-Deja.

28:35.674 --> 28:38.093
See? She always does this.
I told you

28:38.176 --> 28:39.344
if she knew about me and Alex,

28:39.427 --> 28:40.762
she'd figure out a way
to make it about her.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.306
What?
Wait, she told you?

28:50.063 --> 28:53.525
Hey, sweetie, can you give us a minute?

28:53.608 --> 28:55.902
-Can I use your iPad?
-You may.

28:55.985 --> 28:58.571
Take all the time you need.

29:01.991 --> 29:06.454
Ah, so my daughter doesn't think
she can talk to me.

29:06.538 --> 29:08.498
Well, you can add that to your list.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.500
What list?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.085
The running list you keep in your head

29:12.168 --> 29:15.046
-of all the things I can't do right.
-I'm not doing that.

29:15.130 --> 29:16.881
Oh, sure you are.

29:16.965 --> 29:18.717
The curry isn't spicy enough,

29:18.800 --> 29:20.343
and we use our phones at the table,

29:20.427 --> 29:21.886
and I can't control my kids.

29:21.970 --> 29:24.848
Well, you know what,
this is how we are, Mom.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.851
We are loud, and our house is chaotic,

29:27.934 --> 29:30.437
and-and the only time... the only time

29:30.520 --> 29:32.022
I ever feel self-conscious about it

29:32.105 --> 29:33.898
is when you are sitting there judging it.

29:33.982 --> 29:36.776
And-and, like, we can't just
get back to being us

29:36.860 --> 29:39.821
until you go home and take
all the damn judgment with you.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.663
I see.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.417
I'll pack my things.

29:57.255 --> 29:58.548
Did I just...

29:58.631 --> 30:00.008
Yep.

30:05.597 --> 30:07.849
$200?!

30:07.932 --> 30:10.226
$230, actually.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.854
The waitress was good.
I had to tip.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.065
Oh, really, well,
maybe I should get a job there

30:15.148 --> 30:16.941
so I could help pay off your dinner.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.401
Bec, I couldn't have been the only one

30:18.485 --> 30:20.904
who didn't put my card in.

30:20.987 --> 30:24.324
I was... I was so out of place.

30:24.407 --> 30:26.368
I mean, I was sweating in my jacket.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.745
I thought I was gonna puke.

30:28.828 --> 30:31.998
But if these guys
only see me as a foreman,

30:32.082 --> 30:34.918
then I'm never gonna be
anything else to 'em.

30:36.586 --> 30:39.714
Jack, we really needed that money.

30:39.798 --> 30:42.425
I know.
I am sorry.

30:42.509 --> 30:44.177
But hey, that's the good thing
about a credit card, right?

30:44.260 --> 30:47.055
I can just pay it down
over a couple months.

30:47.138 --> 30:50.141
It's fine, babe.
I got this.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.074
He's just been going through a lot.

31:07.826 --> 31:09.911
Losing his job was a real body blow.

31:09.994 --> 31:12.414
No, I-I get it.
It's complicated.

31:12.497 --> 31:17.127
It's just, money... it's the worst.

31:18.211 --> 31:21.589
I mean, growing up,
I never even thought about money.

31:22.674 --> 31:24.759
You know, and looking back, I realize

31:24.843 --> 31:26.761
we didn't have a lot of it.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.515
And three kids.

31:30.598 --> 31:32.684
It wasn't like Dad
was a CEO or anything, you know.

31:32.767 --> 31:36.312
Yet he managed to make sure
we had everything.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.274
Yeah.

31:42.485 --> 31:44.446
Kate, I need you to promise me something.

31:44.529 --> 31:47.449
-What?
-And I know this is just a blip,

31:47.532 --> 31:50.035
but...

31:50.118 --> 31:52.662
Listen, if you're ever strapped for cash,

31:52.746 --> 31:56.332
or if my niece or my nephew
ever need anything,

31:56.416 --> 31:59.377
you got to promise me you'll come to me.

31:59.461 --> 32:00.795
Okay?
What's mine is ours.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.423
-Kev.
-Kate.

32:03.506 --> 32:07.385
What's mine is ours.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.845
Promise me.

32:09.971 --> 32:11.806
I promise you.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.434
(footsteps approaching)

32:14.517 --> 32:16.311
Uh, they're both in a pretty good spot

32:16.394 --> 32:17.729
to transfer to the car, so I think

32:17.812 --> 32:19.731
we should seize the opportunity.

32:19.814 --> 32:22.067
-Okay. I'm gonna go get Jack.
-KEVIN: Yep.

32:23.943 --> 32:26.071
Okay. Uh...

32:28.073 --> 32:29.991
I'm sorry about earlier.

32:30.075 --> 32:33.661
That, uh... it wasn't about you.

32:33.745 --> 32:36.289
It's-- I'm sorry, too.
It's...

32:38.166 --> 32:41.294
Are we okay? 'Cause I just
got done not talking to one brother.

32:41.378 --> 32:43.421
I don't think I can handle
not talking to another one.

32:43.505 --> 32:47.008
Oh, yeah, no, this isn't, uh,
an epic Pearson battle.

32:47.092 --> 32:50.428
It's more of an awkward sushi skirmish.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.389
(chuckles)
Okay.

32:52.472 --> 32:53.848
(quietly):
So...

32:53.932 --> 32:56.601
-Thanks for dinner.
-Yeah.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.104
Let's get them loaded up.

33:03.733 --> 33:04.943
(door opens)

33:07.028 --> 33:08.405
(door closes)

33:11.074 --> 33:12.450
You found my spot.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.704
You think you're the only one
that comes out here

33:15.787 --> 33:18.581
when people are bugging them?

33:18.665 --> 33:21.918
Who do you think
brought the candles out here?

33:22.002 --> 33:24.963
So you're the one responsible
for my fire feature.

33:27.549 --> 33:30.969
I'm really sorry you got upset
about my talk with Malik.

33:31.052 --> 33:33.013
Of course I'm upset.

33:33.096 --> 33:36.808
My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend
is coming back into his life.

33:36.891 --> 33:39.102
At one point, they liked each other

33:39.185 --> 33:41.646
enough to have a baby together.

33:43.648 --> 33:45.775
What if they like each other again?

33:49.029 --> 33:51.865
What?

33:51.948 --> 33:55.535
You know, you are so mature and grown-up

33:55.618 --> 33:58.997
that sometimes I forget
that at the end of the day

33:59.080 --> 34:02.876
you're just a 15-year-old girl
in love for the first time.

34:02.959 --> 34:06.588
Which is why I'm mad at him,
not why I'm mad at you.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.673
(sighs)

34:10.884 --> 34:12.844
Before I came into this family...

34:14.846 --> 34:18.933
...I never had anyone
who was completely in my corner,

34:19.017 --> 34:21.936
but then you came along

34:22.020 --> 34:23.855
and...

34:27.275 --> 34:29.110
...you're my day one.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.992
I'm happy you have a thing with Malik,

34:36.076 --> 34:39.287
but you're supposed to think of me first.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.542
Deja, I am your day one.

34:46.544 --> 34:49.923
And I promise you that I will
always be Team Deja.

34:50.006 --> 34:52.175
First and always.

34:52.258 --> 34:54.844
Hey, look at me.

34:56.596 --> 34:59.974
First and always.

35:03.311 --> 35:04.521
(exhales)

35:06.064 --> 35:08.066
You want to go through
Jennifer's Instagram

35:08.149 --> 35:09.776
-and trash-talk her?
-What do you think I was just doing?

35:09.859 --> 35:11.361
Come on.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.614
Mm. Mm-mm.

35:14.698 --> 35:17.534
Girl, by what-- duck face with a filter?

35:17.617 --> 35:19.828
I don't think so, Jennifer.

35:19.911 --> 35:22.664
You should tag it.
Let me see the next one.

35:29.462 --> 35:32.507
I shouldn't have raised my voice.

35:32.590 --> 35:35.010
It was disrespectful, and I'm sorry.

35:37.345 --> 35:40.223
You really think I'm judging you?

35:40.306 --> 35:41.725
At every turn, Mom.

35:43.727 --> 35:46.479
Well, you're right,
I am judgmental about some things.

35:46.563 --> 35:50.108
Napkins on laps, hanging jackets up.

35:52.110 --> 35:54.029
That's small.

35:54.112 --> 35:58.116
The big things in your life,
the mess, as you call it?

36:00.952 --> 36:02.912
I'm envious of that.

36:05.915 --> 36:09.586
Do you know what it's like
in my house these days?

36:09.669 --> 36:13.256
It's quiet.
So very quiet.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.842
I've learned to tell the time
not by the clock

36:15.925 --> 36:19.471
but by the sound of traffic.

36:19.554 --> 36:22.015
The sound of other people going about

36:22.098 --> 36:25.060
their full, loud, busy lives.

36:25.143 --> 36:27.228
There are no surprises in my house.

36:27.312 --> 36:32.233
No arguments, no loud man
bellowing about his basil.

36:34.402 --> 36:36.613
That's why I like being here.

36:43.578 --> 36:46.373
(phone line ringing)

36:46.456 --> 36:48.958
(phone buzzing)

36:50.168 --> 36:52.712
-Hi.
<i>-Hi.</i>

36:54.130 --> 36:57.050
I just, I just wanted to call
and say thank you.

36:58.259 --> 37:00.011
Okay.

37:00.095 --> 37:01.471
Can I ask what for?

37:03.390 --> 37:05.809
You know, Dad didn't make a lot of money,

37:05.892 --> 37:09.354
and somehow we never even noticed.

37:09.437 --> 37:12.941
<i>And I think that was because of you.</i>

37:13.024 --> 37:16.528
You know, all of the amazing
homemade Halloween costumes,

37:16.611 --> 37:18.488
the backyard birthday parties
that were better

37:18.571 --> 37:20.115
than Chuck E. Cheese.

37:21.241 --> 37:23.702
<i>How did you make it work?</i>

37:23.785 --> 37:26.955
Well, I did have my tricks.

37:27.956 --> 37:30.542
-(refrigerator opens)
-Hey.

37:32.335 --> 37:34.796
Is now a good time to talk about money?

37:34.879 --> 37:36.715
(sighs)
Babe, I'm exhausted. I...

37:36.798 --> 37:39.259
-Okay. Great.
-(sets bottle on counter)

37:39.342 --> 37:42.012
I am gonna take over the finances.

37:42.095 --> 37:45.682
I know how much we spend,
I know how much we need to save.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.059
And at the beginning of every month,

37:48.143 --> 37:49.894
I'm gonna take
ten percent of your paycheck

37:49.978 --> 37:51.938
and put it in savings.

37:54.107 --> 37:55.483
Okay.

37:57.110 --> 37:59.029
Okay.

37:59.112 --> 38:02.323
<i>KATE:</i>
<i>Well, you pulled it off so effortlessly.</i>

38:02.407 --> 38:04.659
<i>Even after Dad died.</i>

38:04.743 --> 38:09.914
I don't think I could
handle that kind of curveball.

38:09.998 --> 38:11.875
<i>It was a different time back then.</i>

38:11.958 --> 38:13.209
<i>And, you know,</i>

38:13.293 --> 38:14.711
you were thrown quite a curveball

38:14.794 --> 38:18.548
when Jack was born,
and you really rose to the occasion.

38:18.631 --> 38:20.925
<i>And then you-you doubled down</i>

38:21.009 --> 38:23.219
<i>and brought Hailey into your family.</i>

38:23.303 --> 38:27.098
So if you ever feel like
you can't handle something,

38:27.182 --> 38:30.018
maybe just think about
what you've already done.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.773
(footsteps approaching)

38:39.194 --> 38:41.029
Hey.

38:44.657 --> 38:46.201
What's up?

38:46.284 --> 38:49.704
I just wanted to tell you that...

38:49.788 --> 38:54.292
you're the greatest father
and provider in the world,

38:54.376 --> 38:56.461
and no matter what happens,

38:56.544 --> 38:59.631
I will always one million
percent be on your side.

39:00.715 --> 39:03.259
That's not statistically possible,
but thank you.

39:03.343 --> 39:05.512
(laughs softly)

39:07.889 --> 39:09.974
There's a job at Jack's school.

39:10.058 --> 39:13.436
-A teaching assistant position.
-Kate, I don't, I don't think...

39:13.520 --> 39:16.064
I already talked to Dr. Salzman.

39:16.147 --> 39:18.400
She said that I would be great
for it and she offered it to me.

39:21.778 --> 39:24.114
I'm gonna take it.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.576
Okay.

39:29.703 --> 39:31.955
We're gonna be okay.

39:32.038 --> 39:35.667
-Okay.
-Okay.

39:42.257 --> 39:44.175
-Hey.
-What's this?

39:44.259 --> 39:45.927
Eh, it's just a cooler.

39:46.011 --> 39:47.429
For your porch.

39:47.512 --> 39:49.389
<i>-My</i> porch?
-Mm-hmm.

39:49.472 --> 39:50.682
What's going on here?

39:50.765 --> 39:52.976
All your favorite IPA's in there.

39:53.059 --> 39:54.769
(laughs)

39:54.853 --> 39:56.688
Talk to me, woman.

39:57.981 --> 40:00.066
My mom is staying.

40:00.150 --> 40:01.860
Indefinitely.

40:03.194 --> 40:07.449
Your entire family treats
our house like a Ramada Inn.

40:07.532 --> 40:08.825
It's my turn.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.160
Hmm.

40:12.537 --> 40:14.456
Mwah.

40:14.539 --> 40:16.374
-Enjoy those IPAs, babe.
-Yeah.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.335
BETH:
It's all you.

40:21.755 --> 40:24.674
Ah, see? I told you no one
was gonna eat the octopus,

40:24.758 --> 40:26.718
because the suction cups freak people out.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.386
Yes, I remember.

40:29.888 --> 40:31.973
-You okay?
-Yeah.

40:32.057 --> 40:34.684
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm okay, I j-- I just,

40:34.768 --> 40:36.478
I can't stop thinking
about what Toby said.

40:36.561 --> 40:38.897
You know, "his family," "my family."

40:39.898 --> 40:41.483
Yeah, he was just upset.

40:42.609 --> 40:44.194
I know, but he wasn't wrong.

40:48.198 --> 40:49.991
♪ ♪

40:53.119 --> 40:54.662
It's crazy, you know, when you're young,

40:54.746 --> 40:57.332
you-you just picture living in a house

40:57.415 --> 40:58.875
with your mom and your dad

40:58.958 --> 41:01.086
and your brother and your sister
kind of forever.

41:01.169 --> 41:02.754
You know?
Those are...

41:02.837 --> 41:04.506
It's your family.

41:04.589 --> 41:06.341
Those are the people that you
spend so many years

41:06.424 --> 41:09.344
sharing walls with, and then
you wake up and you're 40...

41:11.304 --> 41:13.473
...and my mom is sick

41:13.556 --> 41:16.059
and, uh, I'm still
barely talking to Randall.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.063
And Toby and Kate are...

41:25.318 --> 41:27.237
We're not all gonna live
in a compound together,

41:27.320 --> 41:29.948
-are we?
-Probably not.

41:30.031 --> 41:33.284
Probably not.
(clicks tongue)

41:36.037 --> 41:38.456
Well, that's okay.

41:38.540 --> 41:39.874
That is okay.

41:41.292 --> 41:44.713
It's okay because I'm very excited

41:44.796 --> 41:47.799
to spend the next bunch of years
sharing walls with this family.

41:47.882 --> 41:50.218
My family.

41:52.012 --> 41:54.848
I'm very okay with it just being us.

41:54.931 --> 41:56.224
At least for a while.

41:56.307 --> 41:57.976
-Me, too.
-Yeah?

41:58.059 --> 41:59.602
Mm-hmm.

42:01.229 --> 42:03.231
(knocking at door)

42:05.567 --> 42:07.193
Okay.

42:15.910 --> 42:17.912
Let me get this straight.

42:17.996 --> 42:20.582
You only named one baby
after your favorite uncle?

42:57.160 --> 42:59.120
