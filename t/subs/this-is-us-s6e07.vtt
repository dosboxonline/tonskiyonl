leading up to the wedding
are so stressful.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.809
-Uh-huh...
-My advice:

09:19.893 --> 09:21.853
starve yourself early on,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.773
and it'll give you a buffer
for bad decisions later.

Yeah, okay, Mom,
I'm just getting started...

09:37.952 --> 09:39.371

-"Houston, we have a problem."
-(both laugh)

09:54.177 --> 09:57.138

is the-the toilet?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.140
Oh, this way. I'll show you.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.147

-Yeah.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.982

-All right.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.151
Yeah, it's, uh, it's Pinot noir.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.695

10:11.778 --> 10:14.197

-Yeah.

Sure.

10:23.707 --> 10:24.833

10:24.916 --> 10:27.752
I-I just want this to go well.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.213
I want the kids
to like me, you know?

10:30.296 --> 10:33.883
I'm hoping to stick around for
as long as Rebecca will have me.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.722

10:48.106 --> 10:50.525
Why do you keep
looking at Kate, man?

10:50.608 --> 10:52.694
She's just gained
a lot of weight.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.946
KEVIN:
Of course she has.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.948
Think about her life, man.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.366
She lives with Mom,

10:58.450 --> 10:59.951
she's got the worst ex-boyfriend
of all time,

11:00.035 --> 11:02.746
she thinks her dog
killed our dad.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.164

11:04.247 --> 11:06.124
I can totally tell when
they're talking about me.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.293
Randall was shocked
when he saw how big I've gotten.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.588
Hey, everybody gains
the freshman 15 at college.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.132
Yeah, well,
I gained the freshman 40

11:14.215 --> 11:15.425
and I'm not even in college.

ADULT KEVIN:
All right, everybody.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.977

You think Mom's gonna
tell us she needs

11:36.488 --> 11:38.239
to have her driver's license
taken away?

11:38.323 --> 11:40.617
Or what if she lost all
her money to online scammers?

11:40.700 --> 11:43.578
Or maybe she and Miguel
want to become a throuple.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.288
-RANDALL: Oh, Lord. Man-- Kate?
-What?

11:45.372 --> 11:47.665
-It could be anything.
-Kate, what do you think?

11:47.749 --> 11:50.710
I just think that we should
trust Mom, you know?

11:50.794 --> 11:52.921
Let her share
what she wants to share.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.174
-Yeah.
-TOBY: Hey, Kate?
I'm-I'm at my wit's end.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.676
I had to strap him
into the stroller,

11:57.759 --> 11:59.636
'cause he-he w-- he just--
he won't walk with his cane,

11:59.719 --> 12:00.762
and when I pick him up,
he goes nuclear.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.639
Have you tried narrating to him?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.391
Like, the colors of the birds
or the trees?

12:04.474 --> 12:05.809
He just gets really frustrated

12:05.892 --> 12:07.310
when he doesn't know
the full picture.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.896
Yeah, I-I know what he likes,
it's just hard to narrate

12:09.979 --> 12:12.232
a David Attenborough documentary
when he's losing his mind

12:12.315 --> 12:15.318
because he's had too much sugar.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.028
Seriously?

12:17.112 --> 12:18.446
TOBY:
Yeah, seriously.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.948
You know, guys, when I-- um,

12:20.031 --> 12:21.491
if Jack's upset
at home sometimes,

12:21.574 --> 12:23.660
I'll just, I'll sing to him.
(chuckles)

12:23.743 --> 12:25.495
Oh, Jack likes music?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.913
-KATE: Toby.
-Wow. Thanks, Kev.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.289
Hey, can you just,
can you help me

12:28.373 --> 12:30.875
-instead of instructing me?
-Yeah, Tobe, I can.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.839
They're like that
all the time lately.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.424
Yeah, baby stage is rough.

12:37.507 --> 12:40.635
Beth and I used to have
these intense wordless fights.

12:40.719 --> 12:42.554
You ever had a woman
scream at you with her eyes?

12:42.637 --> 12:44.848

-Oh, stop the presses,

12:46.433 --> 12:49.728
The Pearson girls are teaching
Grandma how to floss.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.479
Aww, snap.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.440

12:56.484 --> 12:58.570

what's up.

12:58.653 --> 13:01.781
So, uh, all right, I know
it's just flags for now, right?

13:01.865 --> 13:05.618
But, um, I'm following
Dad's sketch to a T.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.288
And, uh, okay, so we got Randall
right behind you.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.623
That right there, that is your
family wing, that whole thing.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.376
-RANDALL: whoa, whoa, whoa!
-KEVIN: You know? And then, uh,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.628
Kate, your family wing
is gonna be right there.

13:15.712 --> 13:19.841

13:30.560 --> 13:31.978
what we're gonna do
with this area quite yet.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.730
But, you know, I was tinkering
around a couple of ideas.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.482

I thought, maybe?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.734
-That'd be fun.
-Hey. Guys.

-Oh.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.951
You all right?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.620
Yeah, I'm just, uh,
taking everything...

13:48.703 --> 13:50.455
-taking everything in.
-All right.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.916
Let me ask you
a question, Kevin. Um...

13:52.999 --> 13:54.668
Do you have any plans
for a guesthouse,

13:54.751 --> 13:56.753
maybe for people
outside of the family?

13:57.796 --> 13:58.922
Oh, uh...

13:59.005 --> 14:00.674
(laughs):
Well, you know, it's a, it's a,

14:00.757 --> 14:02.217
it's a family compound, Miguel,

14:02.300 --> 14:04.386
so it really wasn't on the top
of my priority list.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.721

Not about the silly women
that you play bridge with

18:39.285 --> 18:40.704
that you secretly hate.

18:41.830 --> 18:44.624
Oh, the pie.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.626
The famous sugar pie. Mom.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.420
What is the secret ingredient,
huh?

18:48.503 --> 18:51.214
What is it? Is it, um--
hmm, let me see.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.299
Is it... is it baloney?

18:53.383 --> 18:56.177
Because you haven't had
a slice of this in 20 years.

18:56.261 --> 18:57.929
JACK:
Rebecca...

18:58.013 --> 18:59.931
♪ <i>A man walks down</i>
<i>the street...</i> ♪

19:00.015 --> 19:01.558
♪ <i>It's a street...</i> ♪

19:01.641 --> 19:03.268
It's everything I say.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.644
-Honey...
-Everything.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.813
Yeah...
(stammers)

19:06.896 --> 19:08.815
♪ <i>Doesn't speak</i>
<i>the language...</i> ♪

19:08.898 --> 19:10.984
(laughs softly)

19:11.067 --> 19:13.361
-Fill her up.
-There you-- Boom.

19:13.445 --> 19:16.531
-All right, so,
you excited for Thanksgiving?
-Yeah.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.492
Yeah, you want to feel this?
T-This is the Pilgrim Rick hat.

19:19.576 --> 19:23.079
It celebrates the creepy
roadside motel clerk

19:23.163 --> 19:24.330
of Pearson lore.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.833
Every year, one special person
gets to wear it,

19:26.916 --> 19:28.501
and this year,
it's Daddy's turn.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.211
Let me get you-- oop, yeah.

19:30.295 --> 19:33.256
Let's just get these out
of the way, yeah, all right...

19:36.301 --> 19:38.511
-Seriously, Tobe?
-Hmm?

19:38.595 --> 19:40.847
What are you afraid of?

19:40.930 --> 19:44.434
Just say it. Are you worried
that Jack's gonna get fat?

19:45.643 --> 19:48.271
Um, am I not allowed
to have any opinion

19:48.355 --> 19:49.981
about what we feed
our son at all?

19:50.065 --> 19:52.233
Yeah, you can have a say,
but you're criticizing.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.110
And you always do that.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.153
It's like you're
a one-man tribunal, okay?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.571
I am here with them every day

19:56.654 --> 19:58.907
-doing the hard work.
-(laughs) I did that work

19:58.990 --> 20:00.492
when I was unemployed, Kate.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.786
What do you want me to do?
Just not have any opinions

20:02.869 --> 20:04.829
about our kids because
you're overly sensitive

20:04.913 --> 20:06.498
about everything I say?

20:06.581 --> 20:08.083
Hey, Tobe.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.960
Come on, man, just...
maybe take it easy?

20:11.044 --> 20:12.921
You know, if I want advice
from a 41-year-old man-child

20:13.004 --> 20:15.465
sleeping on my couch,
I'll let you know.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.008
Kate, I support our family.

20:17.092 --> 20:20.303
All right? I-I am not, uh,
some absentee father

20:20.387 --> 20:22.597
-throwing parties
in San Francisco.
-(baby babbles)

20:22.681 --> 20:23.682
You can't treat me
like a bystander

20:23.765 --> 20:24.849
in our children's lives.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.059
And yes, I am worried

20:26.142 --> 20:27.852
that we are overfeeding
Jack a little,

20:27.936 --> 20:30.230
and I think, I think
we would be insane

20:30.313 --> 20:32.774
not to acknowledge
our genetics here.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.534
Toby, take off the hat.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.953
What?

20:46.037 --> 20:48.748
Take off the hat.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.921
(whispers): I swear,
every year with this family.

20:59.551 --> 21:00.760
(clears throat)

21:02.762 --> 21:04.180
Um...

21:06.891 --> 21:11.438
You don't know how many weeks
she worked on tonight's dinner.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.649
I mea-- Studying family recipes.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.945
She really just wanted it
to be perfect for you.

21:20.697 --> 21:24.200
You know, she-she used
to want to be just like me.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.038
Dave used to call her my shadow.

21:33.209 --> 21:38.214
Listen, um, Dave and I,
we're moving to Connecticut.

21:39.299 --> 21:41.259
Dave got a new job, and...

21:42.427 --> 21:44.971
I can barely get her
to visit me here.

21:45.055 --> 21:48.058
Do you really think
she's gonna drive eight hours?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.643
Yeah, she will.

21:50.727 --> 21:54.898
(stammers)
I promise, Janet, we will.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.739
You know, just--
Give me ten minutes.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.453
YOUNG RANDALL:
Smile. Face.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.205
-Uh...
-BETH: Um, oh.

22:10.288 --> 22:13.249
It's-it's my, uh,
sixth favorite thing about you.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.834
My dimples.

22:14.918 --> 22:16.336
REBECCA:
Aww, that was it?

22:16.419 --> 22:18.880
-That's sweet.
-(clapping)

22:18.963 --> 22:20.215
MIGUEL:
Okay, Marguerite.

22:20.298 --> 22:21.758
-All right, here we go.
-Oh...

22:21.841 --> 22:23.968
Um, I wish I could
say it in French.

22:24.052 --> 22:26.471
Uh, what-what is the word
for <i>nourriture?</i> Um...

22:26.554 --> 22:29.140
Um... apples.

22:29.224 --> 22:31.851
-Uh, orange. Um...
-What kind of...

22:31.935 --> 22:33.520
-REBECCA: Eating.
Bell-- uh, stomach ache.
-No, no, no, no.

22:33.603 --> 22:34.938
-MIGUEL: Tummy ache.
-Oh, no.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.982
Um, it is a place
with colorful flowers.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.360
-(buzzes)
-Can't say "flowers."

22:40.443 --> 22:41.361
-REBECCA: Okay.
-MIGUEL: Take us home.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.738
Come on, old guys, we got this.

22:43.822 --> 22:45.198
MATT:
All right, Rebecca,
let's get some points.

22:47.117 --> 22:52.497
Okay, this is kind of similar
to a turtle, but not...

22:52.580 --> 22:54.749
-Uh, a tortoise.
-No, not a tortoise.

22:54.833 --> 22:58.128
Oh, Miguel, you had
two of these growing up,

22:58.211 --> 22:59.796
-named Lucy and Desi.
-Oh, lizards.

22:59.879 --> 23:00.964
-Yes! Okay.
-Lizards.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.674
MIGUEL:
How did you even remember that?

23:02.757 --> 23:03.675
-(laughs): All right.
-REBECCA: Um...

23:03.758 --> 23:06.678
Oh, uh, okay, you and Jack

23:06.761 --> 23:08.805
once went to Froggy's,
you saw "Mean" Joe Greene,

23:08.888 --> 23:10.807
-you got his...
-Autograph.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.600
-Yes.
-Yes.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.769
-(laughter)
-Um...

23:14.853 --> 23:17.355
You used to call me Mary Tyler
Moore because I wore a...

23:17.439 --> 23:19.024
-A beret.
-(laughs): Yes!

23:19.107 --> 23:21.651
REBECCA (laughs):
This is so fun. Um...

23:21.735 --> 23:25.905
Okay, you were chased
by one of these one year

23:25.989 --> 23:28.241
at the Lundy family picnic,
you had to escape

23:28.324 --> 23:29.576
by jumping in a kiddie pool.

23:29.659 --> 23:30.827
(laughs):
The bumblebee.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.537
Yeah, that was not
my finest moment.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.581
REBECCA:
Oh, I thought
it was really cute.

23:34.664 --> 23:36.416
-(Miguel laughs)
-Um...

23:36.499 --> 23:38.126
Oh, your biggest fear in life.

23:38.209 --> 23:40.045
Balding. Going bald.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.380
-(Miguel laughs)
-Okay, okay, okay, okay...

23:42.464 --> 23:46.551
Uh, okay, this is the greatest
Billy Joel song of all time.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.845
Uh, ♪ <i>She's always a woman.</i> ♪

23:48.928 --> 23:51.097
Okay, but another word
for the last word of that song.

23:51.181 --> 23:53.975
-MIGUEL: Uh, uh, girl?
-Not girl, not girl.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.352
But, um...

23:55.435 --> 23:58.646
Oh, uh, okay.
Um, Susan Dey from <i>L.A. Law.</i>

23:58.730 --> 24:01.024
-You always say
she's one beautiful...
-Female!

24:01.107 --> 24:02.317
Female, yes! I love you, Miguel!

24:02.400 --> 24:05.236
Time's up, time's up,
time's up, guys.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.281
(exhales)

24:09.282 --> 24:12.369
(laughs)

24:12.452 --> 24:13.661
All right.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.465
-Hey.
-Hey.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.217
(Beth exhales)

24:27.300 --> 24:29.928
Aww. Look at this.

24:31.012 --> 24:32.847
So much love.
(tongue clicks)

24:35.016 --> 24:36.518
I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

24:36.601 --> 24:38.853
but I've been sent
to confiscate your phone.

24:38.937 --> 24:41.064
What? "Sent"?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.273
By whom?

24:42.357 --> 24:45.110
Damn near everybody.

24:45.193 --> 24:47.737
-Have I been that annoying?
-Yes.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.075
The girls know
and love your mom.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.993
I know.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.747
I feel disconnected from her.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.085
She used to live
30 minutes away from us.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.213
The girls are used to her
just popping over.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.924
Now she lives
on a whole other coast.

25:09.634 --> 25:13.221
Kev is building her a house.

25:13.304 --> 25:15.098
She's practically raising
all these babies with them.

25:15.181 --> 25:17.934
And I'm happy for them, I am,
I just...

25:19.936 --> 25:21.354
I miss her.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.607
I know.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.237
But I am gonna need
to take the phone.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.531
-Your mom was pretty adamant
about it.
-Okay.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.288
(sighs)

25:38.371 --> 25:40.373
(footsteps approaching)

25:48.882 --> 25:50.091
(Toby exhales)

25:54.054 --> 25:56.765
We just keep having the same
argument over and over again.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.435
I know.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.147
You're upset that I'm not
around more.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.607
I'm sensitive about that.

26:05.690 --> 26:08.109
Pointed jabs, rinse and repeat.

26:12.781 --> 26:13.990
I know.

26:16.618 --> 26:18.203
But in this...
(grunts)

26:18.286 --> 26:20.705
...specific argument,
I want to say...

26:24.000 --> 26:26.252
...we were both fat kids.

26:26.336 --> 26:29.172
And it was hell.

26:29.255 --> 26:32.967
And Jack has our genes.

26:35.136 --> 26:38.264
So if I can help him
to eat healthy

26:38.348 --> 26:43.353
and to avoid any of that pain,
I'm gonna do it.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.865
Do you remember
the song "Kiss Me"?

26:57.492 --> 26:59.953
It played during the
makeover/transformation scene

27:00.036 --> 27:01.579
from <i>She's All That.</i>

27:01.663 --> 27:02.997
Freddie Prinze Jr. is standing

27:03.081 --> 27:05.041
<i>at the bottom of the stairs,</i>
<i>and the formerly</i>

27:05.125 --> 27:07.711
<i>nerdy girl Laney Boggs</i>
<i>walks down the stairs</i>

27:07.794 --> 27:09.838
<i>in this incredible red dress,</i>

27:09.921 --> 27:12.882
<i>and she's so gorgeous</i>
<i>that he's completely floored.</i>

27:12.966 --> 27:15.802
♪ <i>Kiss me, out of</i>
<i>the bearded barley...</i> ♪

27:15.885 --> 27:17.804
Do you remember the scene?

27:17.887 --> 27:20.015
I don't think
that the makeover scene

27:20.098 --> 27:22.350
from <i>She's All That</i> is the piece
of cinematic history

27:22.434 --> 27:24.561
-that you think it is.
-Okay.

27:24.644 --> 27:25.854
(laughs softly)

27:28.148 --> 27:32.193
After my dad died and I started
gaining all the weight,

27:32.277 --> 27:36.489
I would stop myself from eating
by singing "Kiss Me."

27:44.330 --> 27:49.169
♪ <i>Swing, swing,</i>
<i>swing the spinning step...</i> ♪

27:49.252 --> 27:52.380
<i>I would imagine myself</i>
<i>at Kate 2.0</i>

27:52.464 --> 27:54.215
<i>walking down the stairs</i>

27:54.299 --> 27:57.177
<i>thin and beautiful.</i>

27:57.260 --> 27:59.095
<i>Like I was meant to be.</i>

28:02.557 --> 28:05.852
Until I would eat something bad
or too much of it.

28:05.935 --> 28:10.482
You know, and then, I just saw
Kate 2.0 slipping away.

28:10.565 --> 28:12.650
And the shame would
keep building

28:12.734 --> 28:14.277
and I'd keep binging and...

28:14.361 --> 28:17.655
my entire life has been
a cycle of just...

28:17.739 --> 28:20.075
(exhales)
...dieting and binging.

28:20.158 --> 28:24.204
I mean, food has always had
this intense power over me.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.915
And I don't want it to have
that power over our kids.

28:27.999 --> 28:29.709
I want them
to enjoy Thanksgiving

28:29.793 --> 28:31.961
without having shame about it.

28:32.045 --> 28:34.255
Toby...

28:34.339 --> 28:37.509
I need you to know
that I've put a lot of thought

28:37.592 --> 28:39.719
into what I feed our children.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.097
A lot of thought.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.683
And I...

28:44.766 --> 28:47.352
I just don't know
how you don't know that.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.522
(footsteps approach)

28:50.605 --> 28:52.732
Sorry to interrupt. Um...

28:52.816 --> 28:54.693
Kate, are you ready
for that talk?

28:54.776 --> 28:57.779
Yeah. Yeah.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.864
Okay.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.001
I can't stand her, Jack.

29:11.084 --> 29:12.919
Every single word that comes
out of her mouth,

29:13.003 --> 29:15.171
-every word i-is just...
-I-I-- I know.

29:15.255 --> 29:16.965
I know, she just...

29:18.425 --> 29:20.719
She-she feels like
she's losing you.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.929
And she knows
she's driving you crazy...

29:23.013 --> 29:25.265
(sighs) If someone knows
they're acting crazy

29:25.348 --> 29:28.643
and never stops,
that is crazy, right?

29:28.727 --> 29:32.230
Look, I just, I think
things are heightened right now.

29:32.313 --> 29:36.317
I mean, with the holiday,
the wedding, them moving.

29:37.402 --> 29:38.611
Who's moving?

29:41.322 --> 29:43.908
You're moving to Connecticut?

29:43.992 --> 29:45.744
Yes.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.580
Your father finally got
his dream job.

29:48.663 --> 29:50.206
Two years before retirement.

29:50.290 --> 29:52.542
We're moving right after
the holidays.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.047
Mom.

29:57.130 --> 30:00.550
I'm gonna miss you so much.

30:01.593 --> 30:03.094
My baby girl.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.679
Aww.

30:04.763 --> 30:08.141
Rebecca, your dinner
was very good.

30:08.224 --> 30:09.976
-It was.
-No, no, the turkey was dry.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.562
I cannot believe
you're gonna be so far away.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.689
I need you here
for my wedding, Mom.

30:14.773 --> 30:17.525
Aww. Jack, why did you
tell her like that?

30:17.609 --> 30:20.070
You weren't supposed
to just blurt it out.

30:20.153 --> 30:21.821
REBECCA:
Yeah, my mom told you

30:21.905 --> 30:22.864
-in confidence, Jack.
-Yeah.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.449
What the hell?

30:25.492 --> 30:27.243
(stammers softly)

30:32.082 --> 30:35.543
Seems like I've been focusing
on the wrong guy all day, huh?

30:36.711 --> 30:37.879
(laughs softly)

30:37.962 --> 30:40.173
I'm sorry, what?

30:42.175 --> 30:44.803
I did something terrible.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.388
To Sophie.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.224
You know, I blew it.

30:51.351 --> 30:53.937
And I can literally
hear him sometimes.

30:55.939 --> 30:57.357
I can hear his voice.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.403
You know,
h-his disappointment in me,

31:01.486 --> 31:04.239
in my choices and...

31:04.322 --> 31:06.741
things I should have
had a handle on.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.746
You ever get that feeling?

31:13.915 --> 31:17.585
Uh, I'm not sure I get anything
you're saying right now, Kevin.

31:17.669 --> 31:19.671
You should drink some water.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.464
You were his best friend, man.

31:22.632 --> 31:24.509
So...

31:24.592 --> 31:26.553
if you're even considering
acting on whatever the hell

31:26.636 --> 31:29.014
is going on with my mom...

31:29.097 --> 31:30.640
Just know when you feel
the Earth

31:30.724 --> 31:34.894
rumbling beneath your feet,
it's him.

31:34.978 --> 31:36.896
Turning over in his grave.

31:46.239 --> 31:47.449
<i>(Rebecca sighs)</i>

31:50.285 --> 31:52.996
I'm a little nervous,
so I wrote down some notes.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.081
Um...

32:00.211 --> 32:03.214
There is no easy way
to start this.

32:03.298 --> 32:04.924
Um...

32:06.926 --> 32:11.514
When Dad died, it was a shock.

32:11.598 --> 32:14.851
Right? And we were
all left scrambling,

32:14.934 --> 32:17.437
trying to figure out

32:17.520 --> 32:20.815
our roles and how to move on.

32:20.899 --> 32:22.942
Um...

32:23.026 --> 32:27.572
And the one silver lining
of this awful disease

32:27.655 --> 32:31.201
is that I have the opportunity
to make a plan.

32:31.284 --> 32:35.747
To try and ease
some of the burden, so...

32:35.830 --> 32:39.834
First things first, um,
no matter how this thing goes,

32:39.918 --> 32:43.588
no matter how slow or fast,

32:43.672 --> 32:47.050
if decisions need
to be made for me,

32:47.133 --> 32:50.345
Miguel is the captain
of that ship.

32:50.428 --> 32:54.057
-We have talked through
every sad scenario...
-Mm-hmm.

32:54.140 --> 32:57.352
...and the last thing
he needs to deal with

32:57.435 --> 33:00.855
are disagreements about my care.

33:00.939 --> 33:03.066
So I need to hear you all
agree to that.

33:03.149 --> 33:04.776
We agree.

33:04.859 --> 33:05.777
-Of course.
-Yes.

33:05.860 --> 33:06.903
-REBECCA: Yeah?
-Great.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.571
Thank you.

33:08.655 --> 33:13.201
Um, and Kev, Miguel wasn't
asking about the guesthouse

33:13.284 --> 33:14.703
for fishing buddies.

33:16.454 --> 33:18.832
If we are really doing this,

33:18.915 --> 33:21.251
if this incredibly
generous thing you're doing

33:21.334 --> 33:23.211
for all of us is real, then...

33:24.796 --> 33:26.798
...at some point,

33:26.881 --> 33:28.633
I'm probably gonna need
permanent care,

33:28.717 --> 33:31.052
and they're gonna need
a place to stay.

33:38.977 --> 33:41.021
But hopefully, we are

33:41.104 --> 33:44.065
a very, very long way away
from that. Um...

33:44.149 --> 33:48.319
But in the event that, uh,
Miguel, God forbid,

33:48.403 --> 33:51.031
is not here to make
those decisions for me,

33:51.114 --> 33:53.658
I'm gonna need one of you
to stand in for him.

33:53.742 --> 33:55.535
(inhales)

33:55.618 --> 34:00.331
And I've thought long and hard
about who that should be.

34:00.415 --> 34:03.918
I just, I don't want there
to be any confusion or fights.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.881
There are a lot of reasons
for my decision.

34:07.964 --> 34:13.511
I just, I hope that
the three of you can respect it.

34:18.641 --> 34:21.644
Kate, I want it to be you.

34:30.862 --> 34:32.739
(exhales)

34:32.822 --> 34:35.075
Hmm.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.701
Believe it or not,
that was the easy part

34:36.785 --> 34:39.579
of the family meeting. Um...

34:42.499 --> 34:45.335
My last request is, um,

34:45.418 --> 34:49.964
less a request and
more of a demand, actually.

34:50.048 --> 34:52.926
Um...

34:53.009 --> 34:56.221
This disease is a real bastard.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.473
And it-it's set me on a road

34:58.556 --> 35:01.351
that's gonna have a lot
of ugly twists and turns,

35:01.434 --> 35:03.269
and I'm afraid
it's gonna be a lot...

35:05.271 --> 35:08.191
...harder on all of you

35:08.274 --> 35:09.818
than it will be on me
and I hate knowing that.

35:09.901 --> 35:12.195
I hate it.

35:12.278 --> 35:13.405
(exhales)

35:13.488 --> 35:15.240
But what I don't want,

35:15.323 --> 35:17.283
I don't want every holiday
for the camera

35:17.367 --> 35:20.412
to be focused on me.

35:20.495 --> 35:23.790
So I need you all
to hear my voice right now,

35:23.873 --> 35:27.335
your mother's voice,
with all of her faculties.

35:29.337 --> 35:32.674
You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

35:33.717 --> 35:36.094
This thing
that's happening to me

35:36.177 --> 35:40.140
will not be the thing
that holds you back.

35:40.223 --> 35:43.143
So... take the risks.

35:43.226 --> 35:47.897
Make the big moves,
even if they're small moves.

35:47.981 --> 35:51.735
Forge ahead with your lives
in any and every direction

35:51.818 --> 35:53.862
that moves you.

35:53.945 --> 35:58.324
I am your mother, and I'm sick.

35:59.743 --> 36:02.162
And I'm asking you be fearless.

36:04.330 --> 36:07.125
And if that seems like a tall
order, well, guess what? It is.

36:07.208 --> 36:09.210
But...

36:09.294 --> 36:12.297
The only acceptable response

36:12.380 --> 36:14.507
is a resounding "Yes, ma'am."

36:16.509 --> 36:18.845
ALL THREE:
Yes, ma'am.

36:25.727 --> 36:27.062
Okay, I will call you tomorrow
to go over everything.

36:27.145 --> 36:29.189
Dress, food, venues.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.775
-All of it.
-Oh, I can't wait.

36:35.362 --> 36:37.364
(whispers indistinctly)

36:41.534 --> 36:44.329
Oh. There you are.

36:46.414 --> 36:48.958
(exhales)

36:49.042 --> 36:51.753
-Thanks for helping me clean up.
-Oh, ye-- of course.

36:51.836 --> 36:53.713
You know, I'm always,
uh, happy to help.

36:53.797 --> 36:55.674
(laughs softly)

36:58.551 --> 37:00.261
(chuckles)

37:00.345 --> 37:03.515
He thought it was "Piano Man."

37:03.598 --> 37:05.517
Huh?

37:05.600 --> 37:08.728
Billy Joel's, uh, best song?

37:08.812 --> 37:11.189
Yeah, remember, we argued
about it all night at Froggy's?

37:11.272 --> 37:14.025
Uh, Jack was for "Piano Man"

37:14.109 --> 37:16.945
and I was for
"She's Always a Woman."

37:17.028 --> 37:19.155
Yeah, I do remember that. Yeah.

37:19.239 --> 37:20.490
Yeah.

37:23.076 --> 37:25.120
(exhales)

37:25.203 --> 37:28.581
Earlier, um, my jabs at Matt...

37:30.291 --> 37:32.168
...they weren't harmless.

37:32.252 --> 37:35.588
And they weren't accidental.

37:39.426 --> 37:43.054
Not were mine, at her.

37:47.058 --> 37:51.021
(sighs)
These past two years, Miguel,

37:51.104 --> 37:56.693
you have been so good to me,
to us, and...

38:00.071 --> 38:03.575
...I-I just think somewhere
along the way, I just...

38:03.658 --> 38:06.578
I'm moving to Houston.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.915
I got, I got a job offer there
a few months back.

38:10.999 --> 38:13.376
It's-it's... It's near my kids.

38:13.460 --> 38:18.298
And it's why she was making
Houston jokes tonight.

38:20.675 --> 38:23.428
Oh.

38:23.511 --> 38:25.055
I'm sorry.

38:25.138 --> 38:28.016
I-I'm sorry to tell you
like this.

38:31.603 --> 38:34.314
I feel like I've been
staying around,

38:34.397 --> 38:37.942
you know, because I, um...

38:42.489 --> 38:45.658
It's-- It's just,
it's time, Rebecca.

38:47.660 --> 38:50.497
Now that you're back up
on your feet, um...

38:53.541 --> 38:55.543
It's time for me to go.

39:07.430 --> 39:11.059
It's just, I don't, I don't--
I don't know what else to do.

39:15.063 --> 39:16.898
You're my favorite person.

39:29.828 --> 39:32.247
(door closes)

39:32.330 --> 39:34.708
Oh, Captain, my captain.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.544
Uh...

39:37.627 --> 39:39.129
I got the plans here.

39:39.212 --> 39:40.839
You know, I was thinking, um,

39:40.922 --> 39:42.632
maybe we could
go over them together.

39:42.716 --> 39:44.342
Maybe tomorrow,
we could walk the property,

39:44.426 --> 39:47.762
just you and me,
and you tell me what I missed.

39:48.805 --> 39:50.515
I'd like that very much.

39:51.599 --> 39:54.519
-Um...
-Kevin.

39:56.563 --> 39:58.523
Really is a hell of a thing
that you're doing.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.027
Back at you, Cap.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.112
Back at you.

40:08.199 --> 40:10.577
I don't know what to do, guys.
She's still crying.

40:10.660 --> 40:12.287
You can't do anything.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.789
You can't just
fix people, Randall.

40:16.541 --> 40:19.502
This house is too sad.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.171
Hey, where are you going?

40:21.254 --> 40:22.839
I heard the pool closed down.
(clears throat)

40:22.922 --> 40:24.257
The one we went to growing up.

40:24.341 --> 40:26.217
I just want to check it out
before it disappears.

40:26.301 --> 40:27.594
Kev, right now's probably
not the right...

40:27.677 --> 40:29.471
Don't follow me. I'm not 12.

40:31.473 --> 40:32.682
(door closes)

40:35.810 --> 40:37.812
(Rebecca crying)

40:46.654 --> 40:48.490
(exhales)

40:56.373 --> 40:59.209
He's moving to Houston.

41:07.634 --> 41:10.261
I got to ask.
(laughs softly)

41:14.057 --> 41:16.059
Why me?

41:19.020 --> 41:20.772
What?

41:23.066 --> 41:26.111
You are my daughter
and my best friend.

41:26.194 --> 41:28.154
(Rebecca crying)

41:30.156 --> 41:31.825
(softly):
It's okay.

41:33.410 --> 41:34.828
It was always you, Kate.

41:54.055 --> 41:56.057
(whispers indistinctly)

41:58.184 --> 41:59.811
(exhales):
Oh...

42:14.409 --> 42:15.994
(babbles)

42:17.037 --> 42:18.872
I'll tell you one day, baby.

42:20.123 --> 42:21.541
But not yet.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.752
