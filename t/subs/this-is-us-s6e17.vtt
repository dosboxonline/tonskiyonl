39:51.766 --> 39:54.019
I don't even know
if you can hear me,

39:54.102 --> 39:56.187
but, uh...

39:59.232 --> 40:01.484
...I love you, Mom.

40:03.987 --> 40:07.323
Uh, we're good now.

40:09.534 --> 40:11.911
You made us good.

40:17.542 --> 40:20.670
So, uh...

40:20.754 --> 40:23.340
thanks for all the meals.

40:26.134 --> 40:28.136
Thank you for always
making us feel loved.

40:30.764 --> 40:33.808
Thank you for that one time
you beat down David Adams

40:33.892 --> 40:35.769
for hitting me in the head
with a baseball bat.

40:35.852 --> 40:37.854
(stifled laughter, sobs)

40:44.152 --> 40:46.654
I love you, Ma.

40:49.908 --> 40:52.786
This is quite sad, isn't it?

40:54.996 --> 40:57.123
The end?

40:57.207 --> 40:59.709
Oh, I don't know.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.795
The way I see it,

41:01.878 --> 41:04.339
if something makes you sad
when it ends,

41:04.422 --> 41:07.634
it must have been pretty
wonderful when it was happening.

41:09.135 --> 41:11.221
Truth be told,

41:11.304 --> 41:12.764
I've always felt it
a bit lazy

41:12.847 --> 41:16.726
to just think of the world
as sad,

41:16.810 --> 41:19.270
because so much of it is.

41:19.354 --> 41:21.898
Because everything ends.

41:21.981 --> 41:24.275
Everything dies.

41:30.323 --> 41:32.617
But if you step back...

41:34.327 --> 41:38.790
<i>If you step back and</i>
<i>look at the whole picture...</i>

41:40.750 --> 41:42.585
<i>If you're brave enough</i>
<i>to allow yourself</i>

41:42.669 --> 41:46.798
<i>the gift of a really</i>
<i>wide perspective...</i>

PRESENTER:
And so, for his pioneering role

41:50.093 --> 41:51.469
in the development of drugs

41:51.553 --> 41:53.805
targeting Alzheimer's disease,

41:53.888 --> 41:56.516
we're proud to honor
Dr. Marcus Brooks.

41:56.599 --> 41:59.352
(applause)

42:02.022 --> 42:06.901
You know, this all started
from a number of cancer drugs

42:06.985 --> 42:08.528
that didn't work. Uh...

42:08.611 --> 42:09.988
<i>WILLIAM:</i>
<i>If you do that...</i>

42:11.406 --> 42:15.452
...you'll see that the end
is not sad, Rebecca.

42:16.995 --> 42:19.039
It's just the start of the next

42:19.122 --> 42:22.876
incredibly beautiful thing.

42:26.087 --> 42:29.299
It's like that dopey painting
your son made that time.

42:29.382 --> 42:30.759
(laughs)

42:30.842 --> 42:33.803
Hey, I really love
that painting.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.142
(Rebecca sniffles)

42:44.689 --> 42:46.191
Okay.

42:49.819 --> 42:51.321
(kisses cheek)

43:05.627 --> 43:07.712

43:18.807 --> 43:21.267
