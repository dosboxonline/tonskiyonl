01:24.419 --> 01:28.423
Tension that had been brewing for
months in Nigeria exploded yesterday...

01:28.590 --> 01:32.802
...as exiled Gen. Mustafa Yakubu
orchestrated a swift and violent coup...

01:32.969 --> 01:37.348
...against the democratically elected
government of President Samuel Azuka.

01:37.515 --> 01:41.728
in the land with 120 million people
and over 250 ethnic groups...

01:41.895 --> 01:44.689
... there'd been a long history
of ethnic enmity...

01:44.856 --> 01:49.360
...particularly between northern Fulani
Moslems and southern Christian lbo.

01:50.195 --> 01:52.739
The victorious Fulani rebels
have taken to the streets...

01:52.906 --> 01:56.534
...as outbursts of violence
continue all over the country.

01:57.243 --> 02:01.748
Thousands have been killed in
the fighting or executed thereafter.

02:01.915 --> 02:05.710
Fearing ethnic cleansing, most lbo
have abandoned their homes...

02:05.877 --> 02:10.215
...and are fleeing the city or searching
for sanctuary wherever they may find it.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.593
Gen. Yakubu has taken control
of most of the country...

02:13.760 --> 02:15.553
...and appears firmly in charge.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.598
There's no word on the United Nations'
reaction to the coup...

02:18.765 --> 02:22.769
...but United States forces have already
begun to evacuate its embassy.

02:40.620 --> 02:44.040
As you can see behind me,
on the USS Harry S. Truman...

02:44.290 --> 02:49.712
...activity is high as foreign nationals
are evacuated from all over Nigeria.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.464
This once peaceful country...

02:51.631 --> 02:56.219
...has been rocked by a series of ethnic
unrests and brief but bitter battles...

02:56.427 --> 02:59.639
...mainly over control
of Nigeria's vast oil supply.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.183
However, nothing can prepare
the country...

03:02.392 --> 03:06.813
...for the overwhelming and decisive
action that has just taken place.

03:09.649 --> 03:13.236
We have just heard
that the entire presidential family...

03:13.403 --> 03:15.655
...has been assassinated.
l repeat:

03:15.822 --> 03:19.450
The entire presidential family
has been assassinated.

03:36.926 --> 03:38.678
-Welcome aboard, Mr. Ambassador.
-Thank you.

03:38.887 --> 03:40.346
Let me take those for you.

03:40.763 --> 03:42.599
He got one in the leg!

03:43.474 --> 03:45.685
Put him in the sickbay now!

03:49.898 --> 03:51.357
Well, look at you.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.318
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

03:54.485 --> 03:58.531
We appreciate you've been humping out
there, but we have to put you back in.

03:58.990 --> 04:03.661
Priority tasking. We need to extract
a critical personality ASAP.

04:03.912 --> 04:07.207
Now get some chow,
refit for a three-day LLRP.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.376
See you in chow to debrief.
You...

04:10.752 --> 04:13.171
-...go see the medic.
-Aye, captain.

04:22.347 --> 04:23.681
Attention on deck.

04:23.848 --> 04:26.434
As you were, gentlemen. Sit down.

04:31.773 --> 04:33.024
Everybody get chow?

04:33.191 --> 04:35.360
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

04:35.527 --> 04:39.697
Now, intel estimates
5000 Yakubu troops...

04:39.906 --> 04:40.949
...scattered throughout this sector.

04:42.534 --> 04:44.410
They've captured
government armories...

04:44.619 --> 04:48.706
...and unfortunately, we have been
supplying them for far too many years.

04:49.707 --> 04:55.880
in addition, the local militia are killing
anyone who goes to a different church.

04:56.089 --> 04:59.717
All right, now, your prime objective
is to find and extract...

04:59.884 --> 05:04.556
...Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks with
International Relief Services.

05:04.889 --> 05:07.267
Dr. Kendricks is an American
by marriage.

05:07.559 --> 05:10.562
Her late husband
was Dr. John Kendricks.

05:10.728 --> 05:12.105
Your secondary objective...

05:12.272 --> 05:15.733
...is to extract two nuns and a priest
who run a feel-good near Yolingo...

05:15.942 --> 05:17.902
...if they so choose to leave.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.405
St. Michael's Mission, right here.

05:20.613 --> 05:22.407
You will halo over Cameroon...

05:22.574 --> 05:26.035
...and float into your DZ near the edge
of the Mazon Rain Forest.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.412
When you get your package...

05:27.579 --> 05:31.749
...you will proceed
to your extract LZ Alpha.

05:31.916 --> 05:35.920
Our presence on the ground
will be considered hostile.

05:37.297 --> 05:39.048
-Questions?
-Sir...

05:39.215 --> 05:40.341
...rules of engagement?

05:40.508 --> 05:44.804
You will defend yourselves if you're
fired upon. Otherwise, do not engage.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.931
Sir, what's our escape-and-evasion
plan?

05:47.140 --> 05:50.602
Patrol the Cameroon border
through the Tandjile Pass.

05:51.436 --> 05:53.438
Anything else, gentlemen?

05:56.232 --> 05:57.275
All right.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.444
Dismissed.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.457
Gentlemen, three minutes out.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.056
it’s okay. it’s okay.

07:52.223 --> 07:54.726
You speak English?
You speak English?

07:54.893 --> 07:57.395
Good. Good.
I’m not gonna hurt you.

07:58.730 --> 08:01.566
Are there any soldiers here?
Any rebel soldiers?

08:01.733 --> 08:04.068
You sure? You sure?

08:04.235 --> 08:07.363
Good. Good. Can you take me
to Dr. Lena Kendricks?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.449
Do you know who she is?
Okay, here we go.

08:09.616 --> 08:11.659
Nice and easy. Come on.

08:12.076 --> 08:13.745
Zee, we're moving.

08:13.995 --> 08:16.748
it’s all right. I’m not gonna
hurt you, okay?

08:30.970 --> 08:32.263
Open.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.438
Clear.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.132
Lasana, where's that wa...?

09:08.299 --> 09:10.385
These American men are here
to see you!

09:10.635 --> 09:14.639
I’m Lt. Waters with the U.S. Navy.
I’m here to get you and your people out.

09:15.139 --> 09:17.141
We're in the middle of surgery here.

09:17.308 --> 09:19.561
Ma'am, you don't realize
what's about to happen here.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.563
Are you a nun?
Are you one of the nuns?

09:21.771 --> 09:23.147
-Are you a nun, ma'am?
-Yes, sir.

09:23.314 --> 09:26.359
Good. Pack your things
and let's get out of here now.

09:26.526 --> 09:28.236
-Lieutenant!
-Ma'am.

09:28.403 --> 09:32.156
Get those weapons out
of my operating room.

09:32.407 --> 09:33.992
You're frightening my staff.

09:34.492 --> 09:38.830
I’ll be with you when I’m done.
Now please wait outside!

09:39.080 --> 09:40.915
Your staff should be frightened,
ma'am.

09:41.082 --> 09:44.460
Do you know what'll happen to you
and these women when rebels get here?

09:49.757 --> 09:51.759
Doc, maybe you can help her out.

09:51.968 --> 09:54.012
Ma'am, may l assist?

09:54.929 --> 09:56.848
-Are you a doctor?
-No, I’m a corpsman, ma'am.

09:57.348 --> 09:59.100
-Can you stitch?
-Yes, ma'am.

09:59.350 --> 10:01.352
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, he's sure.

10:04.689 --> 10:05.899
Then close for me.

10:07.775 --> 10:09.694
We're taking our good old time here.

10:14.616 --> 10:17.368
All right, Lt. Waters, I’m all yours.

10:20.622 --> 10:21.706
Hurry up, Doc.

10:26.461 --> 10:29.214
l assume you have a plan
to get us all out of here?

10:29.380 --> 10:31.299
Yes, ma'am. Come with me, please.

10:31.466 --> 10:34.802
We've got a 1 2-klick hike to make
to rendezvous to the helicopter.

10:35.053 --> 10:37.222
Get your things together,
but pack light.

10:38.556 --> 10:42.227
Zee, bring your perimeter up.
Keep Flea in place.

10:42.393 --> 10:45.146
We spotted a rebel company
outside of Yolingo on the way in.

10:45.313 --> 10:48.066
We must assume they'll be here
by night, if not sooner.

10:48.233 --> 10:52.153
I’m responsible for 7 0 people here, more
than half of them seriously wounded.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.156
My orders are to evacuate
foreign nationals only, ma'am.

10:55.323 --> 10:56.908
What does that mean?

10:57.075 --> 10:59.410
I mean non indigenous personnel,
ma'am.

10:59.577 --> 11:00.828
Then we have a problem.

11:00.995 --> 11:05.583
l will not leave without
the indigenous personnel.

11:05.750 --> 11:09.796
We're here to get you out.
Now, l suggest you go find the priest...

11:09.963 --> 11:12.841
...go find the nuns, pack your things
and prepare to move.

11:13.007 --> 11:17.428
When the rebel troops get here,
they'll kill everything they see...

11:17.595 --> 11:19.597
...including privileged white doctors.

11:19.764 --> 11:22.934
-What part of that plan don't you get?
-The Cameroon border's 40 miles away!

11:23.101 --> 11:26.271
-You could fly them out in 30 minutes!
-Can't do that.

11:26.437 --> 11:28.356
-Why not?
-Because my orders are very clear:

11:28.523 --> 11:33.194
Evacuate the priest, you and the two
nuns. Now pack and get ready to move.

11:33.361 --> 11:35.613
We can take those who can walk.

11:35.780 --> 11:38.616
They're not my responsibility.
You are my responsibility.

11:45.456 --> 11:47.625
You're right, lieutenant...

11:47.876 --> 11:51.171
...it's not your problem.
it is my responsibility...

11:51.337 --> 11:54.132
...and l will not leave
without my people.

12:01.556 --> 12:02.891
All right, give me a minute.

12:04.142 --> 12:05.643
-A minute?
-That's right.

12:06.144 --> 12:10.648
Sixty seconds. l suggest you use
that time to go find the priest.

12:15.236 --> 12:17.614
Get Command on the horn.

12:17.989 --> 12:19.157
Eagle One to Command.

12:19.324 --> 12:22.160
-Lena, what's going on?
-l don't know yet.

12:22.327 --> 12:24.204
Eagle One to Command.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.001
Eagle One.

12:30.919 --> 12:32.670
Yeah, captain, we got a problem.

12:32.837 --> 12:33.922
No, we got her.

12:34.506 --> 12:37.842
But she wants to bring the 7 0 people
here along with her.

12:39.344 --> 12:40.929
Yes, sir, l understand.

12:41.179 --> 12:42.680
l will handle it.

12:43.014 --> 12:44.349
Eagle One, out.

12:54.192 --> 12:55.860
Dr. Kendricks.

13:02.242 --> 13:05.954
You win. Get your people together.
We leave in a half an hour.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.289
There will be helicopters for them too?

13:08.790 --> 13:11.876
Yes. We can only take those who can
move under their own power.

13:12.877 --> 13:14.546
l understand.

13:15.380 --> 13:16.464
Thank you, lieutenant.

13:16.714 --> 13:18.383
Hurry, please.

13:26.724 --> 13:29.727
Why don't we just get Doc
to tranq her the fuck out?

13:29.894 --> 13:33.481
That's a great idea, Red. Drugging
and kidnapping an American doctor.

13:33.690 --> 13:35.692
I ain't sure this bitch is American.

13:36.651 --> 13:39.737
The doctor is the mission, Red.
Stick with her.

13:40.989 --> 13:44.325
-And we're taking all these people out?
-Go on.

13:46.995 --> 13:49.622
We need everyone able
to travel ready to go.

13:49.789 --> 13:52.292
We must leave quickly.
Quickly!

13:52.458 --> 13:54.544
God will bless you, Lena.

14:02.010 --> 14:05.471
-What did the captain say?
-What the fuck you think he said?

14:11.436 --> 14:15.148
Okay, let's clear these hooches.

15:28.888 --> 15:30.515
Come here, you guys.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.519
it’s okay. it’s okay. Come on.

15:37.146 --> 15:39.816
Hour and a half off the rendezvous
with the bird.

15:41.192 --> 15:44.153
-Can only bring what they carry by back.
-Roger that.

15:45.321 --> 15:48.658
-Where's that priest?
-He says he ain't coming.

15:52.662 --> 15:54.581
Bless you, Lena.

15:55.039 --> 15:56.416
Thank you for everything.

15:56.624 --> 15:59.544
Don't cry, Sister, please.
We'll see each other again.

15:59.711 --> 16:01.337
Take care of yourself.

16:09.345 --> 16:11.973
-You got it, Lake?
-Hundred percent, sir.

16:12.223 --> 16:13.308
All right. Let's go.

16:13.516 --> 16:15.685
Take us out of here,
but don't run away from us.

16:15.852 --> 16:17.520
Roger that.

16:21.733 --> 16:24.152
Keep them moving. Keep them moving.

16:24.319 --> 16:25.445
Come on.

16:27.405 --> 16:30.116
Keep them moving, Slo.
Get her out of there.

16:30.325 --> 16:33.244
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on, let's go.

16:33.411 --> 16:34.704
-Come on, now.
-Catch up!

16:35.121 --> 16:36.581
Sister Grace.

16:36.748 --> 16:39.375
-The mother?
-She is dead.

16:39.751 --> 16:41.252
Oh, no.

16:41.669 --> 16:43.338
Oh, no.

16:43.546 --> 16:45.798
What am l going to do
with this child?

16:45.965 --> 16:47.175
Lena.

16:47.342 --> 16:51.596
Lena, you'll have to take this child.
it’s the only chance she has.

16:52.764 --> 16:54.807
We gotta move quicker than this.

16:57.227 --> 17:00.104
We gotta get back for the Falcon game.
Come on.

17:00.438 --> 17:02.315
Take care of yourself, girl.

17:09.656 --> 17:11.491
Sister Siobhan.

17:15.369 --> 17:17.079
Mind yourself.

17:21.626 --> 17:24.838
Let's go, Sister. Pick your bag up.
Let's go now.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.589
I’m not going.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.174
Sister!

17:28.340 --> 17:30.635
-L.T., she doesn't want to leave.
-I’m not going.

17:30.802 --> 17:32.011
What?

17:36.641 --> 17:38.142
Good luck.

17:38.476 --> 17:40.895
-God bless you.
-Thanks be to God.

17:42.981 --> 17:44.691
All right, let's make it quick.

17:44.858 --> 17:46.651
Come on, ma'am, let's go.

17:47.485 --> 17:50.446
Come on. We have plenty of work
to do now. Come on.

17:51.364 --> 17:52.782
Take care.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.835
Go with God.

18:06.254 --> 18:09.591
-God already left Africa.
-Yeah.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.544
Go easy, doc. Watch your step.

19:28.962 --> 19:30.672
l got her.

19:44.769 --> 19:49.148
We're only five klicks in. it’s seven
and a half miles to LZ Alpha.

19:49.357 --> 19:52.610
We go any slower, we'll start going
backwards in time.

19:52.777 --> 19:55.697
-Red, what do you got back there?
-Five stragglers.

19:55.864 --> 19:59.659
-30 meters and falling from main body.
-All right, roll them up ASAP.

20:00.785 --> 20:01.995
Let's go.

20:03.288 --> 20:05.456
Come on. You've gotta speed up.

20:05.623 --> 20:08.877
Ma'am, speed up.
You too. You--

20:36.487 --> 20:38.364
Watch those trees.

20:52.879 --> 20:54.589
I’m gonna help you.

21:05.975 --> 21:08.520
it’s all right. I’ll tell them.

21:11.231 --> 21:12.565
We got you.

21:13.983 --> 21:15.109
Lieutenant.

21:16.027 --> 21:17.695
We need to stop.

21:19.948 --> 21:21.366
-Lieutenant!
-l heard you.

21:22.700 --> 21:26.120
We can't stop.
Behind schedule. Come on.

21:26.621 --> 21:28.623
These people need to rest.

21:28.790 --> 21:31.084
And we have a child
who needs medication.

21:31.626 --> 21:32.877
Here we go.

21:34.921 --> 21:37.590
There you go, ma'am.
Let's go.

21:39.175 --> 21:40.927
Let's go, doctor.

21:45.390 --> 21:47.976
Come on, sir. Here we go.

21:51.396 --> 21:53.398
What you want to do?

21:55.441 --> 21:57.318
Rest for 30.

21:57.485 --> 21:58.987
Lake, hold it up.

21:59.571 --> 22:01.281
We're gonna rest for 30.

22:01.447 --> 22:03.074
Set a perimeter.

22:05.201 --> 22:06.244
Perimeter up.

22:07.328 --> 22:10.415
Ma'am, we gonna take 30.

23:37.293 --> 23:40.922
L.T., we got guerrilla rebels inbound...

23:41.464 --> 23:42.882
... on our path.

23:43.383 --> 23:46.678
Dr. Kendricks, come with me
right away. Come here.

23:47.470 --> 23:51.808
There's danger on the trail. You must do
everything you can to-- Listen to me!

23:51.975 --> 23:55.311
You must do everything you can to keep
that baby quiet, you understand me?

23:55.478 --> 23:57.856
Whatever it takes. Go now.

24:07.156 --> 24:08.825
Get up. Get up.

24:10.702 --> 24:12.287
Danger close.

24:26.384 --> 24:28.011
Go.

26:56.326 --> 26:57.827
Clear.

27:06.711 --> 27:09.881
Oh, fuck. L.T., straggler, straggler.
Danger close.

27:45.667 --> 27:49.170
Go on, ma'am. Go.
Now is good. Go!

27:50.088 --> 27:52.757
Lake, lead us out before they
realize their tailgunner's gone.

27:53.466 --> 27:55.885
And find us a safe place to rest.

27:56.719 --> 27:59.722
Wait! They're going to the mission.
You have to stop them.

27:59.889 --> 28:03.601
l can't do that. It'd risk the safety
of all these people here.

28:04.227 --> 28:07.772
-Besides, they may bypass the mission.
-You know they won't.

28:08.606 --> 28:11.943
There are a lot of possible scenarios
that could happen, Dr. Kendricks.

28:12.110 --> 28:14.779
l don't presume
to know them all. Red?

28:15.363 --> 28:16.865
Dr. Kendricks.

28:17.115 --> 28:18.783
-Let's go.
-Ma'am.

28:19.117 --> 28:20.326
Come on.

29:17.592 --> 29:20.303
Can't you sleep, lieutenant?

29:20.470 --> 29:22.514
it’s my watch, ma'am.

29:23.515 --> 29:25.517
You can call me Lena.

29:28.394 --> 29:30.813
Dr. Kendricks, l suggest
you get some rest.

29:32.982 --> 29:34.692
You know....

29:42.492 --> 29:44.202
Thank you for saving my life.

29:48.957 --> 29:51.084
it wasn't about saving your life.

29:53.044 --> 29:55.380
it’s about getting the job done.

29:55.880 --> 29:58.883
Completing the mission, that's all.

30:15.692 --> 30:17.235
My dear...

30:17.610 --> 30:22.657
...a thousand difficulties
don't make a doubt.

30:22.907 --> 30:28.079
-But I’m not a good Catholic.
-You don't know that. Only God knows.

30:31.457 --> 30:32.917
Gentlemen.

30:33.626 --> 30:34.919
Please.

30:35.253 --> 30:38.590
This is a house of God.
We have no soldiers here.

30:38.756 --> 30:40.925
There are only sick people here.

30:42.594 --> 30:43.928
Please, sir.

30:44.762 --> 30:47.223
-Gentlemen, please.
-No! No!

30:47.432 --> 30:49.184
No! Please! Please!

30:49.392 --> 30:51.477
-No!
-No!

30:51.728 --> 30:55.899
Commander, please.
This is a house of God.

30:56.232 --> 31:00.486
We have no soldiers here. We have
hope. We have only sick people here.

31:00.653 --> 31:02.655
We have only sick people here.

31:02.822 --> 31:04.115
Please.

31:08.244 --> 31:09.287
No, commander.

31:09.454 --> 31:12.207
And blessed is the fruit of thy womb,
Jesus.

31:12.373 --> 31:14.250
Holy Mary, mother of God...

31:14.501 --> 31:18.213
...pray for us sinners
now at the hour of our death.

31:18.379 --> 31:19.547
Commander, no!

31:19.714 --> 31:21.591
-Blessed....
-No!

31:22.383 --> 31:25.053
Holy Mary, mother of God....

31:38.566 --> 31:40.527
What the fuck was that?

31:42.654 --> 31:43.780
Hyena.

31:47.242 --> 31:49.911
Flea, Lake, status?

31:50.537 --> 31:51.996
Clear.

31:54.958 --> 31:56.000
Clear, L.T.

31:56.876 --> 31:58.419
Zee?

31:59.504 --> 32:02.507
Star One, this is Eagle One.
Be advised on location.

32:03.091 --> 32:07.303
This is Star One. My ETA,
your location, five minutes.

32:07.470 --> 32:09.097
Popping smoke.

32:31.828 --> 32:33.454
Do you have smoke?

32:37.458 --> 32:38.710
Roger. Yellow smoke.

32:39.210 --> 32:40.545
That's us.

32:51.222 --> 32:52.265
Eyes on.

33:25.215 --> 33:26.257
Slo, bring her up.

33:26.424 --> 33:29.552
-Let's go! Come on! Now!
-Let's go, ma'am. Come on.

33:29.719 --> 33:32.597
Let's go now! Come on! You're first!
Let's go!

33:32.889 --> 33:34.390
Goddamn it, let's go! We're late.

33:38.728 --> 33:39.771
Come on!

33:47.779 --> 33:50.365
Why doesn't the other helicopter
come down?!

33:50.532 --> 33:53.034
it’s a gunship!
it’s here to protect us!

33:53.243 --> 33:56.871
-What about the others?
-They'll be fine! Keep moving! Hurry up!

33:57.121 --> 33:58.498
You gotta move faster!

33:58.665 --> 34:00.583
-What are you doing?!
-Keep your head down!

34:00.750 --> 34:01.793
Stand back.

34:01.960 --> 34:03.628
-Where is she going?
-Wait! Back!

34:04.546 --> 34:06.840
Keep your head down!

34:07.549 --> 34:09.175
-Let us go!
-Dr. Lena!

34:09.384 --> 34:11.719
-Wait! Get back!
-Dr. Lena!

34:11.928 --> 34:15.889
Answer me! You never planned
on taking all of us out, did you?

34:16.056 --> 34:20.395
l simply follow orders! My orders are
to get you out! Get on the helicopter!

34:20.562 --> 34:23.106
-What about my people?!
-I’m not here for them.

34:23.273 --> 34:24.399
You lied to me!

34:24.983 --> 34:26.359
You lied to me!

34:26.568 --> 34:29.445
Liar! Bastard!

34:30.487 --> 34:32.991
Lena! Let me go!

34:33.157 --> 34:35.909
What about my people?!
l won't leave them!

34:36.661 --> 34:37.911
You lied to me!

34:38.955 --> 34:41.040
-They're gonna die!
-Secure the doctor.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.918
Dr. Lena! Dr. Lena!

34:46.420 --> 34:48.172
Who decides for me?! You?!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.507
Your government?!

34:50.842 --> 34:53.761
Bastard! l won't leave them!

34:53.928 --> 34:56.347
Let's go! Let's go now!
Let's go!

35:04.189 --> 35:05.773
Let's go! Go! Let's go!

35:05.982 --> 35:09.152
Lena! Lena!

35:09.319 --> 35:10.361
Listen to me!

35:14.324 --> 35:16.910
Listen to me! it’s okay.

35:24.042 --> 35:25.543
Let's go!

36:50.503 --> 36:53.006
Lt. Waters. Starboard side.

36:53.798 --> 36:55.425
We saw this on the way in.

37:07.687 --> 37:08.980
No!

37:09.189 --> 37:10.857
No!

37:12.150 --> 37:13.818
No!

37:26.414 --> 37:28.458
-Doc!
-No!

37:28.625 --> 37:29.667
Come on.

38:37.902 --> 38:40.238
Let's turn it around.

39:35.251 --> 39:36.503
Musa.

39:37.378 --> 39:38.463
Patience!

39:45.803 --> 39:47.680
Lena!

40:01.569 --> 40:03.655
We can only take 1 2 people.

40:03.821 --> 40:05.990
Old, young, anybody
who'll slow us down.

40:06.574 --> 40:08.826
We'll meet up again in Cameroon.

40:12.372 --> 40:14.624
Go. And tell the others.

40:16.918 --> 40:19.838
-God will bless you.
-Hurry, please.

40:30.431 --> 40:31.850
Thank you.

40:51.286 --> 40:52.871
Hurry, please.

40:58.126 --> 40:59.294
Red!

40:59.544 --> 41:01.045
Go with the package.

41:01.713 --> 41:02.839
Now, goddamn it!

41:10.972 --> 41:12.891
What are you doing?

41:16.811 --> 41:18.521
New mission?

41:19.314 --> 41:20.565
No.

41:20.899 --> 41:22.025
Same mission.

41:23.568 --> 41:25.236
Get them ready, Zee.

41:35.330 --> 41:39.000
God will protect you.
Take Mama's cross. Take Mama's cross.

41:39.167 --> 41:40.835
Let's go! Get her ready.

41:41.002 --> 41:43.755
We gotta go. We gotta go.

41:43.922 --> 41:46.174
Let's go! Let's go. Come on!

41:48.259 --> 41:50.053
Get her out of there!
Get off!

41:50.220 --> 41:52.680
-Patience! She'll be safe.
-She's my baby!

41:52.847 --> 41:53.890
Keep your head down.

41:57.602 --> 41:59.687
She has no one to care for her.

42:04.359 --> 42:06.611
Ma'am, you gotta take this baby!

42:06.861 --> 42:08.029
Hold her tight!

42:08.196 --> 42:11.241
-Keep your heads down!
-No more packs, sir. We're maxed out.

42:11.449 --> 42:13.117
See you in Cameroon.

42:13.368 --> 42:14.994
Come on. Let's go.

42:15.411 --> 42:16.913
Here we go. Stay low.

42:17.872 --> 42:19.290
Head down.

42:21.292 --> 42:22.502
Let's go.

42:22.669 --> 42:24.337
Sergeant! Let's go!

43:03.918 --> 43:05.837
Eagle One, over.

43:07.922 --> 43:09.632
Can you wait one, sir?

43:11.259 --> 43:12.594
A.K.

43:12.927 --> 43:14.137
Command.

43:14.470 --> 43:15.513
Yes, sir?

43:15.680 --> 43:20.101
Lieutenant, why is that bird full of
refugees and not your criticals?

43:20.268 --> 43:22.187
The doctor wouldn't leave her people.

43:22.770 --> 43:24.355
You can't get a woman on a helo?

43:24.522 --> 43:25.690
She was on the bird.

43:26.441 --> 43:28.985
-it’s difficult to explain, sir.
-Oh, come on.

43:29.152 --> 43:32.822
We're marching them to LZ Bravo.
Request helicopters to take them out.

43:32.989 --> 43:34.699
Negative on the evac at LZ Bravo.

43:34.866 --> 43:38.119
Come on, give me three choppers. I’ll
have them in Cameroon in 20 minutes.

43:38.286 --> 43:39.495
Negative!

43:39.662 --> 43:42.373
Birds have taken heavy fire. We've
stopped entering Nigerian airspace.

43:42.540 --> 43:45.543
We'll give you what help we can
from our end, but right now...

43:45.710 --> 43:47.003
...you are on your own.

43:50.006 --> 43:51.841
Man, l hope you know
what you're doing.

43:52.926 --> 43:54.093
Me too, sir.

43:54.302 --> 43:57.263
All right. We'll keep you advised
if the situation changes.

43:59.557 --> 44:01.559
Negative on the evac.

44:04.646 --> 44:07.023
Come on. There you go. Come on.

44:08.191 --> 44:10.068
Hang on to the knot, doctor.

44:10.568 --> 44:11.653
-Come on.
-We got you.

44:11.819 --> 44:13.696
Come on. Come on, doc.

44:47.188 --> 44:48.773
Americans.

44:50.525 --> 44:52.735
Some went in the helicopter.

44:54.779 --> 44:56.948
Some went up the mountain...

44:57.699 --> 44:58.950
...to Cameroon.

46:06.059 --> 46:07.227
Slo.

46:14.943 --> 46:16.528
Give me your chow, man.

46:20.698 --> 46:22.825
l don't like roast beef anyway.

46:33.753 --> 46:36.840
We're a little over 30 klicks
to the path to Cameroon.

46:37.006 --> 46:38.174
Roger that.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.686
What do you got?

46:50.520 --> 46:55.024
We got a large body 1 0 klicks back,
bearing 3-6-0 and closing.

46:55.358 --> 46:56.568
How strong?

46:56.734 --> 46:59.696
Thirty, maybe platoon strength,
maybe more.

47:00.238 --> 47:01.447
Rebels?

47:02.532 --> 47:03.783
Could be.

47:04.409 --> 47:06.744
Why would anybody be following us?

47:07.787 --> 47:09.038
l don't know.

47:11.249 --> 47:12.917
But we're gonna find out.

47:14.043 --> 47:15.211
Good job.

47:15.461 --> 47:17.630
-Keep an eye on them.
-Roger that.

47:19.299 --> 47:20.967
-Sir?
-We got a problem.

47:21.134 --> 47:23.636
We got possible hostiles on our 6.

47:23.803 --> 47:25.638
Get them up, get them ready to move.

47:25.805 --> 47:27.265
Roger that.

47:30.185 --> 47:33.271
Dr. Kendricks, could you come with me,
please?

47:33.438 --> 47:35.899
Thank you. it’ll just take a second.

47:40.403 --> 47:44.032
-Do you know why anybody'd follow us?
-No, l don't.

47:44.240 --> 47:45.491
You sure?

47:47.035 --> 47:48.328
Yes, I’m sure.

47:57.712 --> 48:01.132
-Think hard.
-l told you, l don't know.

48:02.884 --> 48:04.302
Get your people ready to go now.

48:04.594 --> 48:07.472
These people have been going
for over 30 hours.

48:08.097 --> 48:09.474
Come on.

48:11.309 --> 48:13.978
Red, help the doctor get ready to move.

49:20.503 --> 49:22.172
How you doing?

49:23.548 --> 49:25.550
The fuck you mean, how am l doing?

49:25.717 --> 49:27.552
You know what I’m talking about.

49:38.271 --> 49:39.898
You know as well as l do...

49:40.064 --> 49:43.026
...that when we left that mission,
those people were dead.

49:44.402 --> 49:48.072
And then we take 28 men, women
and children...

49:48.656 --> 49:50.575
...and we hump for a day.

49:50.783 --> 49:53.119
Zee, keep them moving.

49:53.369 --> 49:55.455
Be with you in a second.

49:56.414 --> 50:00.502
We get them to the LZ, and we leave
them behind to die like the others.

50:01.211 --> 50:02.754
I’m confused.

50:02.921 --> 50:04.714
And the boys are confused.

50:04.923 --> 50:06.382
Get to the point.

50:06.966 --> 50:09.719
Why'd you turn that bird around, L.T.?

50:11.262 --> 50:12.680
Talk to me.

50:13.640 --> 50:16.643
I’m with you either way.
You know that.

50:19.312 --> 50:21.606
When l figure it out, I’ll let you know.

50:34.786 --> 50:36.454
This way.

51:22.208 --> 51:24.294
-L.T.
-Go, Lake.

51:24.544 --> 51:27.463
You're gonna want to come
take a look at this.

51:33.344 --> 51:36.264
Get Dr. Kendricks up here. Come here.

51:37.140 --> 51:40.977
We'll rest here for a minute. Stay down
in these trees. Listen to my men. Go!

51:41.144 --> 51:42.187
Slo.

51:43.021 --> 51:44.355
Stay down. Stay down.

51:44.522 --> 51:46.774
Zee, Flea, with me.

51:51.487 --> 51:53.239
What do you got?

51:53.406 --> 51:56.534
Ringside seats to an ethnic cleansing.

52:09.756 --> 52:11.049
How strong?

52:11.257 --> 52:13.092
l counted seven so far, sir.

52:13.343 --> 52:15.303
-Flea, get eyes on.
-Roger that.

52:20.558 --> 52:23.228
There could be more in the hooches.

52:24.062 --> 52:25.438
Bring them up.

52:35.031 --> 52:37.867
Sir, we could go around them
to the north.

52:49.963 --> 52:51.464
L.T.

52:52.298 --> 52:54.384
Rules of engagement.

52:54.551 --> 52:56.553
We're already engaged.

53:00.807 --> 53:02.851
Hand me the binoculars.

53:08.147 --> 53:09.440
Flea, you got the Zippo?

53:10.775 --> 53:11.818
Roger that.

53:12.485 --> 53:14.112
Zippo first.

53:14.487 --> 53:18.992
Red Team, right flank. This way.
Edge of clearing. Wait for my go.

53:19.325 --> 53:22.203
Silent and quick.
Gold Team, on me.

53:25.498 --> 53:28.209
Silk, close up that back door.

53:28.626 --> 53:31.754
-Flea, keep your eye on the package.
-Roger that.

53:31.921 --> 53:33.423
Holding.

53:33.798 --> 53:34.966
Let's go.

53:43.433 --> 53:44.475
On-site.

54:38.571 --> 54:40.573
Goddamn.

54:45.286 --> 54:46.871
Been going at it all day.

55:03.304 --> 55:05.139
-On-site.
-Roger that.

55:40.758 --> 55:41.801
Go!

57:11.015 --> 57:13.226
it’s okay. I’m here to help you.

57:16.062 --> 57:17.689
I’ll help you. it’s okay.

57:18.731 --> 57:19.941
Atkins!

57:26.739 --> 57:27.866
Hide!

58:47.320 --> 58:48.947
Go! Run! Get out of here!

58:49.113 --> 58:50.823
-Doc, get them out of here!
-Move!

58:51.741 --> 58:52.784
Go! Go!

59:21.521 --> 59:23.982
Hold on. You hold on.

59:29.195 --> 59:30.989
Come on, little man, come on.

59:51.801 --> 59:54.721
Boss, you want me to take a look
at that?

59:56.556 --> 59:58.266
I’m all right.

01:00:35.053 --> 01:00:38.598
it’s a kid. it’s only a fucking kid.

01:00:51.778 --> 01:00:54.822
Motherfucker. Get the fuck up.

01:01:00.078 --> 01:01:01.955
Look at your work, motherfucker.

01:01:20.348 --> 01:01:21.766
Lake.

01:01:50.795 --> 01:01:53.464
Doc, get over here.

01:02:09.147 --> 01:02:10.523
Red.

01:02:25.038 --> 01:02:27.123
Her baby's dead.

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.138
Zee.

01:03:01.908 --> 01:03:05.578
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:03:05.828 --> 01:03:09.082
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

01:03:11.167 --> 01:03:13.044
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:03:13.044 --> 01:03:14.629
Eternal rest grant unto her, oh, Lord.
Let perpetual light shine on her.

01:03:14.838 --> 01:03:17.841
May her soul and the souls
of all the dead rest in peace.

01:03:28.101 --> 01:03:29.769
She has a low pulse.

01:03:39.821 --> 01:03:41.990
How can they do this?

01:03:43.199 --> 01:03:45.285
This is what they do.

01:03:46.703 --> 01:03:49.789
They cut off the breasts
of nursing mothers...

01:03:50.039 --> 01:03:53.710
...so that they'll never again
feed their own babies.

01:03:56.379 --> 01:03:58.631
This is what they do.

01:04:04.596 --> 01:04:05.889
Doc.

01:04:07.557 --> 01:04:09.392
l need morphine.

01:06:34.704 --> 01:06:36.039
Dr. Kendricks.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.793
Dr. Kendricks.

01:06:45.632 --> 01:06:46.758
it’s all right.

01:07:52.615 --> 01:07:56.077
-Is something wrong?
-Let me take care of your arm.

01:07:58.788 --> 01:07:59.998
All right.

01:08:15.805 --> 01:08:16.973
Careful.

01:08:21.352 --> 01:08:22.937
Try this.

01:08:23.145 --> 01:08:25.314
it will help you stay awake.

01:08:27.274 --> 01:08:28.943
What is it?

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:30.694
Cola nut from the tree.

01:08:35.283 --> 01:08:36.743
it’s harmless.

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:38.870
We've been using them
for generations.

01:08:39.787 --> 01:08:42.040
Patience, right?

01:08:44.667 --> 01:08:46.336
How long you been at the mission?

01:08:47.504 --> 01:08:48.921
l live there.

01:08:49.087 --> 01:08:51.883
I’ve been living there since l was 1 0.

01:08:53.176 --> 01:08:54.301
How come?

01:08:55.094 --> 01:08:59.182
l heard they were helping children
who had been forced into the war...

01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:01.434
...so l ran to them.

01:09:07.607 --> 01:09:10.026
Will you get me to my daughter?

01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:19.035
Yes, ma'am.

01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:31.631
How'd you end up here in Africa?

01:09:31.965 --> 01:09:34.341
l came here with my husband.

01:09:36.051 --> 01:09:38.179
We wanted to help.

01:09:39.389 --> 01:09:43.600
We went to Sierra Leone.
They were short of doctors there.

01:09:44.227 --> 01:09:45.435
Cut.

01:09:53.778 --> 01:09:56.155
How did your husband die?

01:10:03.454 --> 01:10:06.124
We were at the hospital.

01:10:07.625 --> 01:10:09.502
The rebels came.

01:10:10.503 --> 01:10:15.049
My husband tried to stop them,
to protect me...

01:10:16.509 --> 01:10:18.261
...but he couldn't.

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:22.140
I’m sorry.

01:10:31.232 --> 01:10:33.443
You did a good thing today.

01:10:42.035 --> 01:10:44.579
l don't know if it was a good thing
or not.

01:10:50.251 --> 01:10:52.962
Feels like so long since I’ve done...

01:10:54.297 --> 01:10:56.758
...a good thing, the right thing.

01:10:59.802 --> 01:11:02.138
You should have some rest.

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:07.352
Thank you for taking care of my arm.

01:11:46.307 --> 01:11:47.851
Easy, boss.

01:11:59.779 --> 01:12:03.157
-Are we there yet?
-Glad to see you still got it...

01:12:03.533 --> 01:12:05.034
...but we got trouble.

01:12:10.623 --> 01:12:11.875
You all right?

01:12:14.711 --> 01:12:15.753
What do you got?

01:12:15.962 --> 01:12:18.715
This is the outfit
that's been on our tail.

01:12:19.215 --> 01:12:22.093
-Hey. You with me, boss?
-Yeah.

01:12:23.261 --> 01:12:25.972
-This is at 2200 hours.
-Yeah.

01:12:26.556 --> 01:12:28.391
Four hours ago.

01:12:28.641 --> 01:12:30.101
Three hours.

01:12:30.351 --> 01:12:33.897
We figured they'd make camp
and come at us after first light, right?

01:12:34.063 --> 01:12:35.481
Bad call.

01:12:35.732 --> 01:12:37.483
Two hours ago.

01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:38.735
One.

01:12:38.943 --> 01:12:43.740
These guys run the damned Olympics.
They've been closing in on us all night.

01:12:44.407 --> 01:12:46.242
How long we got?

01:12:47.243 --> 01:12:49.579
An hour, two tops.

01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:51.497
We shouldn't have stopped.

01:12:52.415 --> 01:12:54.834
How the fuck are they tracking us
at night?

01:13:01.883 --> 01:13:03.676
Someone's transmitting something.

01:13:10.433 --> 01:13:11.935
Zee.

01:13:13.645 --> 01:13:16.147
We got a rat in the nest.
Get them up.

01:13:16.314 --> 01:13:19.442
Take their weapons away.
We search everybody right now.

01:13:19.943 --> 01:13:21.486
-Okay, team.
-Dr. Kendricks.

01:13:21.653 --> 01:13:23.321
-Turn two.
-Lena. Get up.

01:13:23.488 --> 01:13:24.781
Everybody, up.

01:13:24.948 --> 01:13:28.284
Point out everybody that came into
the mission in the last three days.

01:13:28.451 --> 01:13:29.953
-Right now.
-Let's see the weapons.

01:13:32.205 --> 01:13:34.290
Give me your weapons.

01:13:38.711 --> 01:13:41.714
-Gideon.
-Let's go. Step forward, sir.

01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:43.341
Who else?

01:13:45.718 --> 01:13:47.178
Who else?!

01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:48.638
These people.

01:13:48.847 --> 01:13:51.975
-Step forward, you two, right now.
-On your knees.

01:13:52.141 --> 01:13:53.685
L.T.!

01:13:56.646 --> 01:13:57.981
Down! Now!

01:13:58.690 --> 01:13:59.899
Silk.

01:14:01.234 --> 01:14:02.986
No!

01:14:06.197 --> 01:14:09.242
-Hey! What the hell are you doing?
-He's my friend!

01:14:09.409 --> 01:14:11.327
You know what?
He could also be armed.

01:14:11.494 --> 01:14:14.122
Get back there with the others!
Go on!

01:14:19.419 --> 01:14:21.963
-Watch his hands.
-Fuck.

01:14:23.715 --> 01:14:25.008
Shit.

01:14:26.593 --> 01:14:28.678
What the hell is that?

01:14:29.429 --> 01:14:31.139
What do you got?

01:14:31.681 --> 01:14:32.932
He's bugged.

01:14:33.099 --> 01:14:34.601
You fuck!

01:14:40.398 --> 01:14:42.192
-Stop it!
-Who told you to do this?

01:14:42.358 --> 01:14:44.694
-They have my family.
-Who told you to do it?!

01:14:44.861 --> 01:14:47.363
-They have my family.
-Who has your family?!

01:14:47.530 --> 01:14:50.366
l was promised no harm
will come to them.

01:14:51.534 --> 01:14:53.578
-Who told you to do it?!
-Stop it!

01:14:54.245 --> 01:14:57.373
-Who told you to do it?!
-Col. Sadick.

01:14:58.124 --> 01:14:59.209
Col. Sadick.

01:15:00.710 --> 01:15:03.379
l am one of many
who give him information.

01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:06.966
About who?
Information about who?!

01:15:07.133 --> 01:15:09.052
We have to follow....

01:15:10.428 --> 01:15:12.222
Who?! Who?!

01:15:12.388 --> 01:15:14.724
We have to follow....

01:15:15.225 --> 01:15:17.477
-Follow who?!
-Arthur.

01:15:17.644 --> 01:15:19.145
Arthur?

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:28.988
l am not a killer.

01:15:32.325 --> 01:15:34.077
The fuck you're not.

01:15:39.415 --> 01:15:42.418
-What do you wanna do with him?
-Let him bleed out.

01:15:47.173 --> 01:15:48.424
Why?

01:15:50.927 --> 01:15:55.849
What is going to happen
to my family?

01:15:57.934 --> 01:15:59.269
l don't know.

01:15:59.936 --> 01:16:02.689
-Help them.
-Zee. Lake.

01:16:03.106 --> 01:16:05.441
-Get them up.
-Everybody up. Now.

01:16:14.868 --> 01:16:17.078
Who knows what this is?

01:16:23.042 --> 01:16:24.794
This is a transmitter.

01:16:26.963 --> 01:16:30.133
l took this off Gideon's dead body...

01:16:30.967 --> 01:16:32.635
...Dr. Kendricks' good friend.

01:16:36.472 --> 01:16:38.433
You have any more of these here?

01:16:40.977 --> 01:16:43.730
Why would anybody wanna transmit
our position?

01:16:43.897 --> 01:16:48.484
Transmit our position
to over 300 Nigerian soldiers...

01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:50.403
...who ran all night...

01:16:51.321 --> 01:16:54.324
...to get to within an hour and a half
of where we are now?

01:16:59.954 --> 01:17:00.997
Red.

01:17:06.002 --> 01:17:08.463
Somebody's gonna tell me.

01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:11.257
Somebody's gonna start talking
right now.

01:17:12.425 --> 01:17:15.845
Because if they don't tell me
what l want to know...

01:17:16.012 --> 01:17:18.264
...by the time l count to five...

01:17:18.431 --> 01:17:20.683
...I’m gonna kill someone else.

01:17:21.601 --> 01:17:23.102
One.

01:17:25.271 --> 01:17:26.940
Two.

01:17:29.108 --> 01:17:30.985
Three.

01:17:32.737 --> 01:17:34.322
Don't fuck with me.

01:17:34.781 --> 01:17:36.950
-Four.
-Please.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:39.118
Please.

01:17:39.369 --> 01:17:40.870
There's no need for this.

01:17:43.289 --> 01:17:44.874
Please.

01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:47.710
Now you got something
to say to me, don't you?

01:17:48.211 --> 01:17:50.380
My name is Arthur Azuka.

01:17:53.216 --> 01:17:56.803
I’m the only son
of President Samuel Azuka.

01:18:00.431 --> 01:18:02.308
Please don't blame them.

01:18:03.309 --> 01:18:04.394
Please.

01:18:05.979 --> 01:18:07.897
I’m sorry to have misled you...

01:18:08.064 --> 01:18:10.817
...but there are enemies
looking for me everywhere.

01:18:11.067 --> 01:18:13.778
That is why you're being pursued.

01:18:16.906 --> 01:18:19.909
Our report said the entire
presidential family was executed.

01:18:20.285 --> 01:18:22.996
Your reports were incorrect.

01:18:23.997 --> 01:18:26.082
They were not executed.

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:28.751
They murdered my father...

01:18:29.335 --> 01:18:31.421
...along with my mother...

01:18:32.338 --> 01:18:33.840
...and my two...

01:18:35.341 --> 01:18:36.843
...younger sisters...

01:18:38.511 --> 01:18:40.597
...out of greed...

01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:44.893
...and my father's fight for democracy
for his people.

01:18:48.438 --> 01:18:50.023
My people.

01:18:51.608 --> 01:18:54.194
When it first appeared
there might be trouble...

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.946
...my father sent me away with this man.

01:18:58.364 --> 01:18:59.949
Col. Okeze.

01:19:01.868 --> 01:19:05.538
Lieutenant, his father was more
than the president.

01:19:05.705 --> 01:19:07.373
He was the tribal king.

01:19:07.540 --> 01:19:09.751
That makes him the heir
to the lbo nation.

01:19:10.376 --> 01:19:12.337
it’s a bloodline they must cut.

01:19:12.795 --> 01:19:16.466
The Fulanis will comb heaven
and earth to find him.

01:19:24.641 --> 01:19:26.142
You knew about this?

01:19:28.061 --> 01:19:30.647
You knew all the time,
and you didn't tell me.

01:19:33.650 --> 01:19:35.485
l didn't trust you...

01:19:35.735 --> 01:19:37.445
...at the time.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:47.789
l wonder what it takes
to earn your trust.

01:19:50.917 --> 01:19:52.544
Red, Lake.

01:19:57.882 --> 01:20:00.635
Tell them to pack their things.
We're leaving.

01:20:02.178 --> 01:20:05.139
Men, give them their weapons.
We're moving out of here.

01:20:05.306 --> 01:20:06.850
-Pack up your things.
-Come on.

01:20:07.016 --> 01:20:08.226
Move it out!

01:20:09.018 --> 01:20:11.229
-Get in, get out. Okay?
-Come on.

01:20:11.688 --> 01:20:13.523
Move it. Move it.

01:20:13.982 --> 01:20:16.901
-Come on. See you. Hurry back.
-Back in formation.

01:20:46.931 --> 01:20:50.894
They must continue their route to
the Tandjile Pass or they'll lose a day.

01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:55.398
So they must come out here,
near the Cameroon border.

01:20:58.735 --> 01:20:59.903
No!

01:21:30.266 --> 01:21:32.143
How many men
do you have in Gashanka?

01:21:39.609 --> 01:21:41.110
Right on time.

01:21:41.402 --> 01:21:44.072
Good hustle, Red.
Come on up and brief Zee.

01:21:47.116 --> 01:21:49.577
This river will get us
straight into Cameroon.

01:21:49.953 --> 01:21:51.663
They'll be expecting us.

01:21:53.248 --> 01:21:54.958
What do you think?

01:21:55.124 --> 01:21:57.418
l think we're fucked
either way we go.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.006
We backtrack, cross downstream...

01:22:02.173 --> 01:22:05.635
...come up, go through the jungle
and rip right into Cameroon.

01:22:07.095 --> 01:22:09.597
Roger that. Let the other men know.

01:22:09.764 --> 01:22:11.599
-Yes, sir.
-Good job.

01:22:12.475 --> 01:22:13.810
L.T.

01:22:14.435 --> 01:22:17.105
-What do you got?
-Rhodes on the phone.

01:22:20.775 --> 01:22:22.277
Yes, sir, captain, this is Waters.

01:22:22.443 --> 01:22:24.821
Intel reports military elements
in your sector...

01:22:24.988 --> 01:22:28.032
...conducting search and destroy
of a U.S. military unit...

01:22:28.491 --> 01:22:32.328
...moving with Arthur Azuka, son of the
late president. What can you tell me?

01:22:32.495 --> 01:22:34.831
Yes, sir, we just discovered that
ourselves.

01:22:34.998 --> 01:22:38.334
He and his bodyguard hid themselves
within Dr. Kendricks' refugee party.

01:22:39.794 --> 01:22:41.629
That's a major problem, lieutenant.

01:22:41.796 --> 01:22:45.633
He involves your mission in the
internal politics of a foreign nation...

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.804
...affecting U.S. diplomacy and
seriously increases the mission's risk.

01:22:50.013 --> 01:22:52.640
He's considered a criminal
by the new regime.

01:22:52.849 --> 01:22:54.475
He's a major liability.

01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:58.146
-What exactly does that mean, sir?
-His party is excess cargo.

01:22:58.521 --> 01:23:00.190
You mean he's not human, sir?

01:23:00.857 --> 01:23:04.444
Captain, this man is the lbo tribal
leader. Do you know what that means?

01:23:04.611 --> 01:23:06.738
Cut the shit. Who do you think l am?

01:23:08.865 --> 01:23:12.118
Sir, we both know what'll happen to him
if l leave him out here.

01:23:12.327 --> 01:23:14.579
There won't be a trial or a jury.

01:23:14.746 --> 01:23:17.207
Outside the courthouse,
they'll put two in his head.

01:23:17.582 --> 01:23:21.127
I’m just asking for a little help here.
Put yourself in my shoes, Bill.

01:23:21.294 --> 01:23:22.962
I’ve been in your shoes, lieutenant.

01:23:23.129 --> 01:23:26.216
Send in an air evac immediately
and get all of us out of here, sir.

01:23:26.382 --> 01:23:29.844
Negative on air support at this time.
Airspace is too hot.

01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:34.432
Your judgment has risked the lives of
your men and the mission's success.

01:23:34.599 --> 01:23:37.894
l advise you, complete the evacuation
as planned! Do you read me?!

01:23:39.395 --> 01:23:41.564
Yes, sir, l read you. Loud and clear.

01:23:42.398 --> 01:23:46.069
But l cannot, in good conscience, do that
without taking these people to safety.

01:23:46.236 --> 01:23:47.320
That's not your mission!

01:23:47.487 --> 01:23:49.739
When have l not completed a mission?

01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:53.368
My team will complete this mission.

01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:55.119
l give you my word on that.

01:23:55.286 --> 01:23:56.996
l don't like this.

01:23:57.664 --> 01:23:59.916
Get your ass back here alive
soon as possible.

01:24:00.083 --> 01:24:02.168
Maintain contact with OP center.

01:24:04.504 --> 01:24:06.756
I’ll direct air support
as soon as l can.

01:24:07.090 --> 01:24:08.424
l promise you.

01:24:09.175 --> 01:24:10.343
Yes, sir.

01:24:11.302 --> 01:24:12.679
Eagle One, out.

01:24:15.515 --> 01:24:16.850
Bring them up.

01:24:17.517 --> 01:24:20.186
Everybody up on L.T. now. Double time.

01:24:20.436 --> 01:24:21.980
So much for diplomacy.

01:24:23.106 --> 01:24:24.482
Come on, let's go.

01:24:29.529 --> 01:24:33.449
Here's the deal. it’s been strongly
suggested that we turn over Arthur...

01:24:34.534 --> 01:24:37.287
...and abandon these refugees
out here in the bush.

01:24:39.455 --> 01:24:42.542
I’ll tell you right now
I’m not gonna do that.

01:24:43.084 --> 01:24:44.836
l can't do that.

01:24:46.963 --> 01:24:48.756
l broke my own rule.

01:24:50.133 --> 01:24:52.302
l started to give a fuck...

01:24:53.136 --> 01:24:55.805
...and brought you guys along with me.

01:24:56.973 --> 01:25:02.478
We're about to walk into some serious
shit. Before we do, I’d just like...

01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:09.068
...to hear what you guys have to say
about it. That's all. Speak freely.

01:25:10.153 --> 01:25:12.322
in my opinion, sir...

01:25:12.488 --> 01:25:15.700
...we cut our losses.
This isn't our fucking war.

01:25:17.118 --> 01:25:19.287
As far as me being in or out...

01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:21.998
...you know the answer to that.

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:26.961
Let's get these people to safety.

01:25:27.962 --> 01:25:29.839
Let's finish the job.

01:25:32.842 --> 01:25:34.802
l can't leave them, sir.

01:25:37.514 --> 01:25:39.182
I’m good to go.

01:25:41.267 --> 01:25:43.311
What about you, Red?

01:25:47.815 --> 01:25:50.944
l can't look at them
like packages anymore.

01:25:52.737 --> 01:25:55.240
I’m gonna get them out...

01:25:55.782 --> 01:25:58.076
...or I’m going to die trying.

01:26:04.207 --> 01:26:06.042
Are we there yet?

01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:13.550
Thanks, fellas.

01:26:17.220 --> 01:26:19.973
Strip those packs down
to rolling gear only.

01:26:20.306 --> 01:26:24.394
Have the refugees drop anything
that don't go '' boom.'' Let's move.

01:26:26.729 --> 01:26:29.357
Double time. Let's go. Hustle.

01:26:32.026 --> 01:26:33.278
L.T...

01:26:35.738 --> 01:26:38.575
...those Africans are my people too.

01:26:39.409 --> 01:26:43.621
For all the years that we were told
to stand down and to stand by...

01:26:46.374 --> 01:26:48.001
...you're doing the right thing.

01:26:53.673 --> 01:26:55.175
For our sins.

01:26:55.508 --> 01:26:56.551
Hooyah.

01:26:57.177 --> 01:26:58.219
Hooyah.

01:27:09.022 --> 01:27:10.231
We gotta go.

01:27:10.565 --> 01:27:11.608
Let's go.

01:27:11.774 --> 01:27:12.942
Lieutenant.

01:27:14.110 --> 01:27:16.154
I’m sorry l didn't tell you
about Arthur.

01:27:16.738 --> 01:27:19.199
l should have trusted you.

01:27:22.035 --> 01:27:23.995
it’s not your fault.

01:27:27.290 --> 01:27:30.418
l would've done the same thing
if l was in your position.

01:27:30.585 --> 01:27:32.462
l wouldn't have trusted me either.

01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:35.131
I’m gonna get your people
to Cameroon.

01:27:36.466 --> 01:27:39.677
l promise.
Come on. We gotta hurry.

01:28:31.771 --> 01:28:34.691
L.T., hold one.

01:28:34.941 --> 01:28:37.193
Hold one.

01:29:02.468 --> 01:29:04.304
What do you got, Lake?

01:29:12.228 --> 01:29:15.523
Everybody down.
Get down! Get down!

01:29:21.029 --> 01:29:23.823
Where you at, motherfuckers?

01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:25.992
Where you at?

01:29:41.799 --> 01:29:43.218
Fat fuck.

01:29:46.221 --> 01:29:48.389
Look at this motherfucker.

01:29:48.598 --> 01:29:50.183
Pussy.

01:29:51.601 --> 01:29:53.937
Clear, L.T. it’s just a pig.

01:29:54.354 --> 01:29:55.939
I’m crossing over.

01:30:00.610 --> 01:30:01.653
Sniper, 11 o'clock.

01:30:01.819 --> 01:30:03.404
Sniper, 11 o'clock.

01:30:06.908 --> 01:30:09.536
-Zee!
-Smoke! Give me smoke!

01:30:09.702 --> 01:30:10.912
L.T...

01:30:11.579 --> 01:30:13.248
...l got hit. Sniper.

01:30:13.414 --> 01:30:14.457
Go!

01:30:21.631 --> 01:30:24.884
-Look who it is. The fucking cavalry.
-Keep your hand on that.

01:30:25.051 --> 01:30:26.386
-Sit him up.
-How's he doing?

01:30:27.136 --> 01:30:29.347
He's all right. One in the shoulder.
Clean hit.

01:30:29.514 --> 01:30:31.307
Sorry, sir. He caught me sleeping.

01:30:31.474 --> 01:30:32.559
Don't worry about it.

01:30:32.767 --> 01:30:35.895
-Did you get that little son of a bitch?
-We got some of him.

01:30:36.145 --> 01:30:37.689
-You see anybody else?
-Sorry.

01:30:37.856 --> 01:30:39.274
-I’m better than that, sir.
-Don't worry.

01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:40.650
I’m better than that.

01:30:40.817 --> 01:30:42.026
-Fuck that.
-Can you walk?

01:30:42.277 --> 01:30:43.319
Yes, sir.

01:30:44.571 --> 01:30:47.574
Let's go, Doc. Make it tight.
Get me back in this shit.

01:30:48.283 --> 01:30:49.784
All right. Ready.

01:30:53.663 --> 01:30:55.248
Get down!

01:31:42.837 --> 01:31:44.088
Grenade!

01:32:23.545 --> 01:32:25.004
Dr. Kendricks!

01:32:25.505 --> 01:32:27.215
Lena!

01:32:27.841 --> 01:32:29.300
Lena!

01:32:37.308 --> 01:32:39.018
Lena, listen. Wake up.

01:32:39.227 --> 01:32:42.355
Wake up. Oh, God. Wake up.
Wake up. Do you hear me?

01:32:42.564 --> 01:32:43.815
Okeze! Okeze!

01:32:43.982 --> 01:32:45.149
Wake up.

01:32:45.358 --> 01:32:46.818
Okeze.

01:32:47.777 --> 01:32:49.362
Lena, listen to me.

01:32:49.571 --> 01:32:51.906
We've gotta get out of here now!
You hear me?

01:32:52.448 --> 01:32:56.202
Listen, we gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of here right now.

01:32:56.369 --> 01:32:58.371
Slo, Zee, get them ready to go now!

01:32:58.997 --> 01:33:00.039
Sit up.

01:33:00.206 --> 01:33:01.249
Slo!

01:33:02.876 --> 01:33:04.294
Slo!

01:33:06.462 --> 01:33:09.549
-Oh, fuck! Goddamn it!
-Fuck.

01:33:10.216 --> 01:33:12.468
l never saw it coming, boss.

01:33:12.677 --> 01:33:13.928
Son of a bitch.

01:33:16.681 --> 01:33:19.142
it wasn't supposed to happen
like this.

01:33:19.309 --> 01:33:21.769
it’s my fault.
it’s my fault, all right?

01:33:21.936 --> 01:33:23.188
Breathe.

01:33:24.689 --> 01:33:26.399
-You know what to do, right?
-Yeah.

01:33:26.608 --> 01:33:27.942
Yeah, l know what to do.

01:33:28.193 --> 01:33:31.070
You hear me? l got it, okay?

01:33:31.237 --> 01:33:33.281
Breathe. Just relax.

01:33:35.617 --> 01:33:37.118
Breathe.

01:33:37.577 --> 01:33:38.620
No!

01:33:41.122 --> 01:33:42.165
No.

01:33:44.459 --> 01:33:47.712
You'll get them there, right?
it’s not for nothing, right? Right?

01:33:47.879 --> 01:33:50.006
I’ll get them there. Don't worry.
l got it.

01:33:50.173 --> 01:33:52.759
l got everything, all right?
Don't worry.

01:33:54.385 --> 01:33:56.763
Breathe, Slo. Breathe, breathe.

01:33:58.056 --> 01:34:00.350
l guess we're there, huh, boss?

01:34:01.392 --> 01:34:03.311
Yeah, we're there.

01:34:25.708 --> 01:34:28.378
Zee, get these people ready to go.
Do it now.

01:34:29.254 --> 01:34:30.713
Silk...

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.633
...get his weapons and ammunition.

01:34:35.426 --> 01:34:37.095
What about the body?

01:34:37.428 --> 01:34:39.138
We gotta come back for it.

01:34:39.556 --> 01:34:41.057
Goddamn it.

01:34:41.432 --> 01:34:43.017
Goddamn it!

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:53.027
-No.
-Listen to me, goddamn it! Listen to me!

01:34:53.194 --> 01:34:56.072
This man is dead. lf you don't
want his death to be meaningless...

01:34:56.239 --> 01:34:59.534
...it's time for you to become a man
and get your people into Cameroon!

01:34:59.784 --> 01:35:02.745
Now cowboy the fuck up!
You got it?

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.750
Do you understand me?

01:35:07.917 --> 01:35:09.711
-Yes, sir.
-Good.

01:35:09.878 --> 01:35:11.045
-You all right?
-Yes, sir.

01:35:11.254 --> 01:35:12.755
-Stay with this man.
-Yes, sir.

01:35:12.922 --> 01:35:13.882
it’s your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

01:35:13.882 --> 01:35:15.550
it’s your job to keep him alive!
Everybody down!

01:35:18.386 --> 01:35:19.804
Get down! Stay down!

01:35:20.805 --> 01:35:23.600
Open up those toolboxes, boys.
They'll be coming!

01:35:23.766 --> 01:35:25.602
Conserve your ammo!

01:35:25.810 --> 01:35:26.895
Get down! Get back.

01:35:27.228 --> 01:35:29.355
