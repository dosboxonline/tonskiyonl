What is it now this early?
Are you going to bury my livestock again?

01:37.937 --> 01:41.937
No, It's just a normal inspection,
there's just a small leak at the site.

01:42.937 --> 01:43.937
Go ahead, move along.

01:44.938 --> 01:52.939
Why are you doing this to me?
Just like the last time?

01:54.939 --> 01:59.939
I promise, not this time, now move along.

01:59.940 --> 02:00.940
Go

02:06.941 --> 02:13.941
What a really bad day, rough
morning, what more...

02:14.942 --> 02:15.942
(PHONE RINGS)

02:19.942 --> 02:20.942
Come on

02:21.943 --> 02:22.943
Ehhhh

02:32.944 --> 02:33.944
Oh come on

02:44.946 --> 02:46.946
What a really rough day for me

03:35.952 --> 03:39.953
TRAIN TO BUSAN

03:41.953 --> 03:42.953
Madame,

03:43.303 --> 03:47.454
Statistical data companies we
showed abnormal in stock market.

03:48.004 --> 03:50.454
Please do not take your investment now.

03:50.804 --> 03:52.965
The market will fall once
you've taken your investment.

03:54.505 --> 03:54.955
Yes, I understand.

03:55.205 --> 03:56.525
Thank you for your consideration.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.726
No, it is not. I will do
it as soon as possible.

04:03.956 --> 04:05.056
Yes.

04:05.806 --> 04:07.407
It will be run according to your wishes.

04:09.807 --> 04:10.857
Please take care!

04:27.109 --> 04:28.109
Come into my office.

04:46.012 --> 04:47.012
What is the matter?

04:47.412 --> 04:48.988
Sell all of our assets in the stock market.

04:49.012 --> 04:50.362
Selling it all?

04:50.812 --> 04:51.812
Yes

04:52.012 --> 04:54.863
Isn't it too risky to do that?

04:55.313 --> 04:56.913
Still we could maintain our first asset.

04:57.113 --> 04:58.393
And wait if something better...

04:58.513 --> 04:59.513
Mr. Kim...

04:59.963 --> 05:00.964
Yes.

05:01.664 --> 05:02.964
Just do what I tell you to do.

05:05.964 --> 05:08.246
We must be watchful of the
possibility that might happen.

05:09.065 --> 05:10.065
Okay..

05:13.065 --> 05:14.165
Wait a minute Mr.Kim...

05:16.066 --> 05:19.166
What's the popular gift for kids nowadays?

05:25.667 --> 05:29.966
Forget it. You really can't be a good dad to
Su-an. You didn't even attend her recital.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.967
I did not forget that.
There's a lot of work here.

05:31.968 --> 05:33.967
She can stay here in Seoul with me.

05:33.968 --> 05:35.928
Soo-an will be happy when
you bring her to Busan.

05:36.468 --> 05:38.589
Are you going to buy her gifts again for
her birthday?

05:39.269 --> 05:41.869
You should listen to her once instead of
giving her gifts.

05:42.869 --> 05:44.149
Can you keep her wish this time?

05:44.269 --> 05:45.870
Yes, I promise we'll go to Busan.

05:47.270 --> 05:48.870
I don't trust your promise

05:49.270 --> 05:50.870
Trust me.

05:51.270 --> 05:52.770
Keep your promise.

05:53.071 --> 05:54.551
Soo-an is tired of all the promising.

05:55.071 --> 05:56.191
Nevermind, I'll talk to her.

05:56.471 --> 05:58.471
You know that it's her
birthday tomorrow right?

05:59.371 --> 06:00.872
I know!

06:28.675 --> 06:29.875
Here, I'll hold this.

06:30.175 --> 06:31.476
Thank you..

06:31.976 --> 06:32.976
Where is she?

06:33.276 --> 06:36.576
She's in her room playing.

06:38.977 --> 06:42.577
When will we go there?

06:42.977 --> 06:44.577
Mom, did you talk to dad?

06:48.978 --> 06:50.978
-I'm gonna hang the phone now, he's here.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.180
It's okay you can talk to her.

07:06.980 --> 07:07.980
-I already hung up.

07:11.881 --> 07:14.281
Your mother called me earlier.

07:15.882 --> 07:18.282
Dad promised I will bring you to Busan.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.962
But before that, there
are things I have to do.

07:22.382 --> 07:24.283
So Suo-an needs to be patient.

07:32.984 --> 07:33.984
Here

07:37.984 --> 07:41.985
You thought I forgot?
Happy birthday.

07:42.985 --> 07:43.985
Why, open it.

08:01.988 --> 08:03.988
Why? Don't you like it?

08:17.990 --> 08:19.990
-Last year on children's day too.

08:24.991 --> 08:29.991
Well, tell me what you want.

08:30.991 --> 08:31.992
-Busan

08:32.991 --> 08:35.890
-I want to go to mom at Busan.

08:35.892 --> 08:36.892
Tomorrow...

08:39.693 --> 08:41.869
We will definitely be there after
father's affairs are finished...

08:41.893 --> 08:42.493
No...

08:42.893 --> 08:43.893
Tomorrow...

08:44.393 --> 08:46.394
Dad you always say we'll go next time.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.154
Anyway, tomorrow we have to go...

08:48.794 --> 08:50.894
You don't have to come with me.

08:51.794 --> 08:53.494
Grant my wish for once...

09:01.196 --> 09:02.696
Is there a lot of work?

09:03.496 --> 09:04.496
Yes there is.

09:06.396 --> 09:08.896
Are you going to Busan tomorrow?

09:08.897 --> 09:10.897
Yes.

09:12.397 --> 09:16.898
You did well. Try talking with
your wife when you arrive there.

09:18.398 --> 09:21.898
It's not good if you
just break-up like that.

09:22.398 --> 09:23.899
You two should re-unite again.

09:24.399 --> 09:28.899
There is nothing wrong you
are together again...

09:31.400 --> 09:33.480
Try it this time so that
you can come back again...

09:33.700 --> 09:34.700
Mother...

09:35.000 --> 09:36.900
I don't want to talk about it.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.901
Let it stay in the past.

09:43.801 --> 09:44.801
Okay.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.302
Do not be too busy with work.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.902
Sometimes, life isn't
necessarily on one side.

09:53.502 --> 09:54.903
Enjoy your life.

09:55.503 --> 09:58.903
Remember your family.

10:43.009 --> 10:44.909
Come Soo's spirit..

10:46.009 --> 10:47.910
Keep singing..

10:49.010 --> 10:51.910
Applause for Soo-an!

11:07.012 --> 11:09.012
Mom, okay mom.

11:10.013 --> 11:18.014
We're on our way now, see you.

11:33.016 --> 11:37.016
That song, why didn't you
finished singing it?

11:38.016 --> 11:41.017
How did you know? You weren't there.

11:42.017 --> 11:46.017
Papa always knows what you've been doing

11:48.518 --> 11:49.918
I don't just focus on work.

11:50.518 --> 11:51.918
I focus on you too. - Okay

11:55.019 --> 11:57.719
You sing good.

11:58.019 --> 12:02.720
I'll tell you, money does not
always bring happiness to us.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.720
Remember it always..

12:16.021 --> 12:17.021
Ahh.. That was close.

12:23.022 --> 12:25.023
What's going on?

12:31.023 --> 12:34.024
Soo-an, are you okay?

12:35.024 --> 12:36.024
What's happening?

12:49.026 --> 12:50.386
Now, we really need to keep going.

12:56.027 --> 13:01.027
(CENTRAL STATION)

13:04.028 --> 13:12.029
<i>All departing passengers, kindly board the train now
as this train is now ready to depart for Busan.</i>

13:14.029 --> 13:15.029
Excuse me, where is the south station?

13:15.030 --> 13:17.028
-Ah, South station, you need to that way.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.030

Please rest during this trip.

14:00.335 --> 14:01.935
Good.

14:04.536 --> 14:05.936
Wow, jihee is here.

14:10.737 --> 14:12.937
What do you mean, I'm coming with you.

14:13.737 --> 14:14.737
I'm your cheerleader.

14:17.738 --> 14:18.738
How are you all?

14:28.739 --> 14:30.239
Hey, go find another seat okay.

14:31.739 --> 14:33.180
Stingy you did not want to share...

14:33.340 --> 14:36.040
Hey, if you're thankful to see me,
Just say "Thank you".

14:36.340 --> 14:38.740
Even the "tools" you use are
also right for you...

14:39.340 --> 14:41.741
She's right...

14:43.341 --> 14:50.742
Accept her. Accept her.
Accept her. Accept her.

14:53.342 --> 14:54.742
Here, eat this.

14:56.043 --> 14:56.743
Aigoo...

14:57.043 --> 14:59.743
Where did you get that egg.

15:00.043 --> 15:01.743
Eat it yourself.

15:02.143 --> 15:03.344
- Eat this.
- No, I don't like.

15:04.944 --> 15:08.544
- Chief, Are you already on board?
- Yes, but why?

15:08.944 --> 15:13.545
There are problems in the office...
We need to take care of...

15:14.145 --> 15:15.545
Really?

15:16.145 --> 15:18.546
We'll discuss it after I get back.

15:18.946 --> 15:20.546
I'll be there after lunch.

15:21.246 --> 15:22.946
- See you later...
- Good.

16:27.255 --> 16:29.955
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

16:31.255 --> 16:33.956
Please forgive me.

16:34.256 --> 16:40.957
I'm so sorry.

16:48.057 --> 16:49.058
Excuse me.
- Yes?

16:49.059 --> 16:51.057
Are you the one in charge?
- Yes.

16:51.058 --> 16:54.057
Ive seen a suspiscious passenger

16:54.058 --> 16:58.058
Where is the passenger?
Inside the lavatory,

16:58.059 --> 17:02.058
its been a while since then
- really? let's see.

17:02.059 --> 17:06.060
Ahh. I apologize Mr.
I will check on it.

17:17.060 --> 17:20.061
Passenger? Passenger?

17:36.064 --> 17:38.063
-Everyone is dead.

17:38.064 --> 17:39.064
-Mister, mister..

17:40.064 --> 17:42.064
-I'm sorry, but may I see your ticket?

17:42.065 --> 17:43.065
-Everyone is dead.

17:48.065 --> 17:52.065
- Mister, if you don't have a ticket we
need to drop you off at the next station.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.066
- Everyone is dead.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.067
-Hey Kid, If you don't study well.

18:08.068 --> 18:10.067
You'll end up like him.

18:10.068 --> 18:15.069
My mother told me not to
say that kind of words.

19:00.075 --> 19:01.075
In a hurry?

19:02.075 --> 19:04.075
We'll, you'll need to find another place
because it will take a while.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.076
You could use the other comfort room.
Go there.

19:09.076 --> 19:10.076
Go

19:11.076 --> 19:13.077
It will really take a while.

19:14.077 --> 19:17.077
Baby? How are you doing down there?

19:18.077 --> 19:23.078
Ah.. Sorry, go ahead, take your time...

An Emergency in car 11!

19:47.187 --> 19:48.986
Chief!

20:02.181 --> 20:04.091
- Hello?
- Yes, Kim?

20:04.092 --> 20:06.390
It's more serious than we anticipated.

20:06.391 --> 20:09.891
It's not just an overnight Ansan incident.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.084
I don't know what's happening,
but it's not a simple strike.

20:40.104 --> 20:41.104
That's terrible.

20:41.788 --> 20:44.504
People nowadays will riot over anything

20:44.505 --> 20:48.205
In the old days, they'd be re-educated.

20:48.406 --> 20:50.907
You mustn't say that.

20:51.109 --> 20:52.609
Look, look.

Sorry, the thing is...

25:21.126 --> 25:22.126
-Get off me!

You idiot! Go help her!

-

25:39.129 --> 25:40.129
What's with you?!

25:44.129 --> 25:45.159
Have you gone mad?!

Where's the lock?

27:20.171 --> 27:22.142
Buddy, how do I lock this?

27:25.142 --> 27:27.142
Do you hear me?

27:30.143 --> 27:31.143
Let it go

27:32.143 --> 27:33.143
What?

27:36.143 --> 27:39.144
I don't think they know how to open.

27:48.145 --> 27:50.145
They attack because they see us.

28:10.148 --> 28:11.148
What in the...

28:12.148 --> 28:13.148
What are they?

28:18.149 --> 28:19.149
Su-an, you okay?

28:22.150 --> 28:23.150
Hey buddy,

28:24.150 --> 28:25.150
What is it?

28:27.150 --> 28:28.270
Don't you owe me an apology?

28:29.151 --> 28:30.151
What do you mean?

28:30.181 --> 28:32.151
Look at this chump

28:33.151 --> 28:35.150
You shut the door in our faces, asshole!

28:35.151 --> 28:38.152
You weren't the only ones in danger!

28:39.152 --> 28:40.152
What a piece of work.

28:42.152 --> 28:42.182
Come here.

28:43.152 --> 28:44.153
I'll feed you to them.

28:44.183 --> 28:45.183
Stop it!

28:46.153 --> 28:47.153
Everyone's just scared.

28:52.154 --> 28:54.154
-Attention please!

28:54.184 --> 29:00.155
- Due to our current situation,
we won't be stopping in Cheonan,

29:01.155 --> 29:03.155
- For your safety, please
stay in your seats.

29:08.156 --> 29:10.156
Hello, anyone there?

29:11.156 --> 29:13.156
-Yes, go ahead

29:13.186 --> 29:17.157
Do you even know what's going on back here?

29:17.187 --> 29:19.157
Why aren't you stopping at Cheonan?

29:20.157 --> 29:21.157
We're aware, sir

29:21.187 --> 29:23.158
-This is the order from the control center.

29:24.158 --> 29:25.158
-Please be seated.

29:25.188 --> 29:30.159
That's nonsense! People are going rabid!

29:31.189 --> 29:33.159
Stop in Cheonan, got it?!

29:35.159 --> 29:36.159
Excuse me.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.360
I'm really sorry but could she sit down?
She's pregnant.

29:43.160 --> 29:44.160
-Okay

29:44.190 --> 29:45.191
Sit, sit.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.161
Thank you.

Mom

29:52.162 --> 29:55.162
-Are you on your way?

29:56.162 --> 29:57.162
Yes, we're en route.

29:58.162 --> 30:00.163
Where are you? Why is it so loud?

30:01.163 --> 30:05.163
- What's happening you say?
Everyone's fighting.

30:06.163 --> 30:08.164
-Are you and Su-an okay?

30:09.164 --> 30:11.164
Why're you breathing
like that, are you hurt?

30:12.164 --> 30:14.164
-Seok-woo, my baby.

30:15.165 --> 30:20.165
-Please take care of Su-an

30:21.165 --> 30:22.166
Mom, you okay?

30:23.166 --> 30:25.166
-My dear Su-an...

30:26.166 --> 30:32.167
- I love her so much, but
she only wants her mom...

30:37.168 --> 30:38.168
-That bitch!

30:47.169 --> 30:48.169
Mom?

30:51.169 --> 30:52.170
-Dad!

30:54.170 --> 30:55.170
-Dad!

30:58.170 --> 30:59.170
-Is granny okay?

31:08.172 --> 31:09.172
What the hell?

31:12.172 --> 31:13.172
Sweetie, sit down.

31:58.178 --> 32:00.178
<i>My fellow citizens</i>

33:48.193 --> 33:49.193
Su-an, sit over here.

33:50.193 --> 33:51.553
Don't worry, I'll give her a call.

33:54.194 --> 33:55.194
Jong-gil, come sit down.

33:56.194 --> 33:57.274
-You're older, you sit down

33:58.194 --> 33:59.194
Im fine, take it.

34:00.194 --> 34:01.275
-Baby, let's go over there.

Ma'am, take my seat.

34:09.196 --> 34:11.196
-I'm okay, -No, please sit.

34:14.196 --> 34:15.196
Child..

Would you like one?

34:21.197 --> 34:22.197
-Thank you!

34:22.226 --> 34:24.197
What a great kid.

34:30.197 --> 34:32.199
-We both got seats. -Keep walking.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.199
Su-an, you didn't have to do that.

34:38.199 --> 34:40.199
-Do what? -Being good.

34:41.199 --> 34:44.199
At a time like this, only
watch out for yourself.

34:47.201 --> 34:48.201
Answer me.

34:53.202 --> 34:56.202

<i>May i have you attention please</i>

35:08.204 --> 35:11.204

35:24.206 --> 35:27.206
<i>DAEJEON STATION is our last stop.</i>

35:28.206 --> 35:29.326
Which cities can be entered?

35:30.206 --> 35:32.207
Yeosu, Uljin, Busan. What about Daejeon?

35:33.207 --> 35:34.327
Excuse me, I need to use it.

35:35.207 --> 35:36.207
What about Daejeon?

35:37.207 --> 35:38.207
Why not?!

35:39.208 --> 35:41.238
Sweetie, stay put.

35:45.208 --> 35:46.239
Hey, kiddo.

35:47.209 --> 35:48.209
-Yes?

Who is he? Your dad?

35:51.209 --> 35:52.209
-Yes

35:53.209 --> 35:54.210
Real dad? -Yes.

35:55.210 --> 35:56.210
I wanna know.

35:57.210 --> 35:58.210
What does he do?

35:59.210 --> 36:00.210
-He's a fund manager.

36:01.211 --> 36:02.211
Fund manager? -Yes

36:03.211 --> 36:04.211
He's a bloodsucker.

36:06.211 --> 36:08.211
He leeches off others.

36:09.212 --> 36:11.212
-Don't say that in front of his child.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.212
It's okay

36:14.212 --> 36:16.213
That's what everyone thinks,

36:22.213 --> 36:23.213
-Want some?

36:24.214 --> 36:26.214
-It's what Sleepy eats.

36:28.214 --> 36:29.294
-This is Sleepy. Say hello.

36:32.215 --> 36:33.215
Baby's name is Sleepy?

36:34.215 --> 36:35.215
-No, the fetus name.

36:36.215 --> 36:37.215
-It's like a nickname,

36:38.215 --> 36:42.216
- He's daddy too lazy to
come up with a name yet.

36:44.216 --> 36:45.216
Touch her belly.

36:46.217 --> 36:47.217
-Right here.

36:48.217 --> 36:49.217
-Go on.

36:55.218 --> 36:56.218
-Felt it?

36:58.218 --> 36:59.218
I made that.

37:03.219 --> 37:06.219
-You idiot... -But it's true, No?

37:08.219 --> 37:09.220
(Analyst Kim)

37:18.221 --> 37:20.221
<i>Mr. Suh, you called me at a bad time.</i>

37:21.221 --> 37:22.221
Wait, Wait!

37:23.221 --> 37:24.222
Let me ask you something,

37:25.222 --> 37:26.222
<i>What?</i>

37:27.222 --> 37:28.222
I'm on KTX to Daejeon.

37:29.222 --> 37:32.223
<i>KTX? Right this minute?</i>

37:33.223 --> 37:34.223
Yes, I'm almost there,

37:35.223 --> 37:38.223
Is it true military is deployed in Daejeon?

37:39.224 --> 37:40.224
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

37:42.224 --> 37:46.224
Is that so? It must be safe there.

37:48.225 --> 37:50.225
<i>Well... It's...</i>

37:51.225 --> 37:54.226
Min, It is safe, right?

37:55.226 --> 37:59.226
<i>Once you arrive, you'll be quarantined.</i>

38:00.226 --> 38:01.226
What?

38:04.227 --> 38:08.227
I'm with my daughter.

38:09.228 --> 38:12.228
Can you help me and my daughter?

38:13.228 --> 38:14.228
<i>But the thing is...</i>

38:15.228 --> 38:18.229
I'll get you a real scoop, do me a favor.

38:20.229 --> 38:24.230
<i>Don't go to the main square,
come to the East one.</i>

38:25.230 --> 38:26.230
<i>I'll let my men know.</i>

38:27.230 --> 38:30.230
Okay, thank you. Thanks so much.

38:38.231 --> 38:42.232
All dead... All dead...

38:56.234 --> 38:57.234
What's going on?

38:58.234 --> 38:59.234
So quiet.

39:00.234 --> 39:01.234
Is it Daejeon?

39:05.235 --> 39:06.235
There's nobody.

39:09.235 --> 39:11.236
Why isn't anyone here?

40:20.245 --> 40:22.245
What's going on back there?

40:25.246 --> 40:28.246
This is that violent
incident I told you about.

40:29.246 --> 40:30.406
-You're the conductor? -Yes.

40:32.247 --> 40:33.647
How many can fit in the engine car?

40:34.247 --> 40:35.687
We must uncouple it and go to Busan.

40:36.247 --> 40:37.247
-Uncouple? -Yes!

40:38.247 --> 40:39.247
-We can't! -Why not?!

40:40.248 --> 40:41.248
It can't be done here.

40:42.248 --> 40:43.328
Then, where's the Military?

40:44.248 --> 40:45.248
Right...

40:46.248 --> 40:47.689
I only received a report about it...

40:48.249 --> 40:50.249
-Where's my business card...

40:51.249 --> 40:53.249
-I'm COO of Stallion Express,

40:54.249 --> 40:55.730
-all routes into Daejeon are cut off.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.256
-our buses are all rerouted

40:57.280 --> 40:58.280
But what for?

40:59.250 --> 41:01.250
The City's been quarantined!

41:02.250 --> 41:03.451
They probably won't let us in.

41:04.251 --> 41:07.251
But Busan is still open, let's go there!

41:08.251 --> 41:10.252
-Wait, if that's true...

41:11.252 --> 41:12.612
-We just take others. -Take Who?!

41:13.252 --> 41:14.492
-Let's check the station first.

41:16.252 --> 41:17.252
Hey!

41:20.253 --> 41:21.253
Dammit!

41:44.256 --> 41:45.256
<b>RESTRICTED AREA</b>

42:13.260 --> 42:14.260
Where are we going?

42:15.260 --> 42:17.260
We're going this way.

42:18.261 --> 42:19.261
-Just us? -Yes, Let's go.

42:26.262 --> 42:27.262
What is it?

42:29.262 --> 42:30.262
I'm going this way too.

42:31.262 --> 42:33.423
The main square is that way,
just follow other people.

42:34.459 --> 42:36.059
I'm gonna come with you.

42:37.079 --> 42:38.679
I heard your phone call.

42:39.443 --> 42:41.178
About pulling you two out.

42:43.137 --> 42:45.404
I know others will be quarantined.

42:47.413 --> 42:48.814
It's not true, Su-an.

42:49.372 --> 42:50.972
I'll go tell the others.

42:51.007 --> 42:54.540
- You don't have to. - Of course, I do!

42:54.633 --> 42:56.901
Forget them! We're all on our own!

42:58.676 --> 43:02.279
You only care about yourself.

43:05.004 --> 43:08.225
That's why mommy left.

43:27.900 --> 43:28.900

49:46.024 --> 49:47.024
Run faster!

50:06.619 --> 50:08.086
Snap out of it, idiot!

50:37.433 --> 50:38.433
Watch out!

50:59.900 --> 51:04.537
Control, 101 could not dock
at Daejeon due to outbreak.

51:04.817 --> 51:07.777
Advise which station is
available to dock, over.

51:08.199 --> 51:13.029
<i>101, due to unstable comm,
it is difficult to advise.</i>

51:13.381 --> 51:18.184
Control, is 101 clear to reach Busan? Over.

51:21.237 --> 51:24.487
<i>101, we'll clear your route to Busan.</i>

51:24.488 --> 51:24.506
<i>Control center, out.
101, we'll clear your route to Busan.</i>

51:24.507 --> 51:25.507
<i>Control center, out.</i>

51:26.776 --> 51:29.444
Advise when you make contact with Busan.

51:30.301 --> 51:31.301
101, out.

52:47.779 --> 52:49.279
<i>Attention everyone.</i>

52:50.406 --> 52:55.482
<i>For those safety of those on board,
we won't be making any stops,</i>

52:55.663 --> 52:57.530
<i>and head straight for Busan.</i>

52:58.918 --> 53:00.718
Conductor, can you hear me?

53:01.403 --> 53:02.403
<i>Go ahead.</i>

53:02.982 --> 53:05.049
Were you able to contact Busan?

53:05.337 --> 53:08.364
<i>No, the communication is erratic.</i>

53:09.053 --> 53:11.514
Full speed, no matter what!

53:12.069 --> 53:14.137
Or we won't get in, understand?

53:22.345 --> 53:24.012
Young-guk, where are you?

53:26.109 --> 53:29.110
I thought you were dead!

53:29.808 --> 53:30.808
I'm sorry!

53:33.365 --> 53:34.698
No one else made it!

53:36.726 --> 53:37.845
I'm sorry.

53:49.050 --> 53:50.183
<i>- Baby? - Mister!</i>

53:52.197 --> 53:54.931
Huh? Why are you answering? Where are you?

53:54.932 --> 53:56.856
<i>We're in the train washroom!</i>

53:56.991 --> 53:59.992
Washroom? which car?

54:00.226 --> 54:02.683
<i>Well... it's...</i>

54:02.725 --> 54:03.725
Car 13!

54:04.545 --> 54:06.679
- Get your ass over here! - Baby

54:10.276 --> 54:12.210
Was that my kid? Is she okay?

54:13.132 --> 54:14.400
Washroom in car 13.

54:29.193 --> 54:30.441
Gonna pass through?

54:32.871 --> 54:35.213
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

54:35.214 --> 54:35.671
how will you come back?
Let's say you got through and rescue them,

54:35.672 --> 54:36.748
how will you come back?

54:41.713 --> 54:42.713
In car 15,

54:44.690 --> 54:46.423
people are gathered there.

54:52.715 --> 54:53.715
<i>Car 9</i>

55:11.470 --> 55:12.604
Only 4 cars away.

55:15.104 --> 55:16.104
I'll lead,

55:17.981 --> 55:19.181
you in the middle,

55:20.831 --> 55:22.165
and you in the back.

55:24.953 --> 55:27.420
Block anyone attacking from the rear.

55:37.393 --> 55:41.148
I heard you're a fund manager.

55:44.298 --> 55:45.765
Then you're an expert,

55:47.322 --> 55:49.522
at leaving useless people behind.

55:56.183 --> 55:58.116
Wait till we exit the tunnel.

56:12.882 --> 56:13.883
Let's go.

57:24.782 --> 57:25.782
Come on!

57:28.905 --> 57:29.906
Let's go!

57:46.351 --> 57:47.351
Move.

59:31.643 --> 59:32.643
Out of the way.

59:36.607 --> 59:39.741
They stopped once we
entered the tunnel, right?

59:41.043 --> 59:42.722
Probably because of darkness.

59:42.723 --> 59:42.976
Yeah, I think so too.
Probably because of darkness.

59:42.977 --> 59:44.123
Yeah, I think so too.

59:47.556 --> 59:49.223
There are even more here.

59:50.454 --> 59:51.654
What do we do now?

59:52.497 --> 59:54.164
There's no way around it.

59:55.431 --> 59:56.431
Let's go.

59:58.455 --> 01:00:00.455
Give me your handphone.

01:00:00.456 --> 01:00:01.902
Why?

01:02:07.183 --> 01:02:08.784
Get that out of my face.

01:02:10.605 --> 01:02:11.605
Yo, douche.

01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:17.241
Felt good to see your kid thanks me?

01:02:17.679 --> 01:02:19.370
Are you grateful or what?

01:02:20.306 --> 01:02:22.306
Why is your ringtone so tacky?

01:02:23.647 --> 01:02:25.047
What's wrong with it?

01:02:27.467 --> 01:02:28.734
How do i change it?

01:02:30.844 --> 01:02:34.821
Am i funny? You little rat?

01:02:36.097 --> 01:02:37.231
How tall are you?

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.505
181cm.

01:02:39.527 --> 01:02:41.846
10km away, at 300km/h...

01:02:42.319 --> 01:02:43.319
What?

01:02:45.234 --> 01:02:49.576
2 minutes, upcoming tunnel
will give us 2 minutes.

01:02:49.857 --> 01:02:51.657
- Can we do it? - We gotta.

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.667
If we miss this one,
there's another in 3km...

01:02:57.668 --> 01:03:01.191
I bet you never get to
play with your daughter.

01:03:03.702 --> 01:03:05.035
When she gets older,

01:03:06.924 --> 01:03:09.525
she'll understand why you work so hard.

01:03:12.031 --> 01:03:14.860
Dads get all the bad rap and no praise,

01:03:15.663 --> 01:03:18.064
but it's all about sacrifice, right?

01:03:21.503 --> 01:03:24.716
What's with the look? Did I sound cool?

01:03:33.930 --> 01:03:36.130
<i>People rescued. Heading over now.</i>

01:03:36.381 --> 01:03:37.981
My friend's coming here!

01:03:39.773 --> 01:03:40.650
What did you say?

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:40.773
My friend from another car is coming over.
What did you say?

01:03:40.774 --> 01:03:43.450
My friend from another car is coming over.

01:03:44.023 --> 01:03:45.891
- Who's coming? - My friend!

01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:49.816
He was in car 9, and he
rescued some people.

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:51.294
Rescued?

01:03:53.188 --> 01:03:57.531
From there to here, passing
through those monsters?

01:03:58.448 --> 01:03:59.848
Without any injuries?

01:04:01.703 --> 01:04:03.703
You sure they're not infected?

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:06.985
Are you damn sure?!

01:04:08.836 --> 01:04:09.969
What do you mean?

01:04:10.398 --> 01:04:13.214
Look, look at them.

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.680
At a moment like this,

01:04:15.889 --> 01:04:20.272
no one knows what happened
to their families.

01:04:21.279 --> 01:04:25.809
We don't even know if your
damn friends are infected!

01:04:26.477 --> 01:04:28.931
But allow them in here?!

01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:45.821
Sir,

01:04:47.679 --> 01:04:50.520
please say something.

01:04:51.603 --> 01:04:53.003
They'll be here soon.

01:04:55.534 --> 01:04:56.534
Sir!

01:08:45.296 --> 01:08:46.296
Get over here.

01:08:55.350 --> 01:08:56.350
One!

01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.700
Two!

01:09:06.755 --> 01:09:07.755
Run!

01:09:20.929 --> 01:09:22.063
Jin-hee! Jin-hee!

01:09:25.408 --> 01:09:26.608
Hurry the hell up!

01:09:36.426 --> 01:09:37.426
Open up!

01:09:39.188 --> 01:09:41.341
Hey! Open this door!

01:09:43.423 --> 01:09:44.423
Jin-hee!

01:09:44.519 --> 01:09:45.519
Open this door!

01:10:01.704 --> 01:10:04.435
- Open up! - Jin-hee, Jin-hee

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:16.456
Open it now!

01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:18.594
It wont budge!

01:10:18.862 --> 01:10:19.862
It can't open it!

01:10:20.134 --> 01:10:21.134
Smash it!

01:10:22.216 --> 01:10:23.216
Stand back!

01:10:29.839 --> 01:10:30.839
Hurry up!

01:10:35.852 --> 01:10:36.852
Dammit...

01:11:01.511 --> 01:11:02.711
You stupid idiots!

01:11:16.391 --> 01:11:17.391
Come on!

01:11:28.903 --> 01:11:29.903
In-gil!

01:11:35.866 --> 01:11:36.866
Young-guk!

01:11:40.581 --> 01:11:41.567
Stand back!

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:41.579
Young-guk!
Stand back!

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:42.580
Young-guk!

01:12:17.355 --> 01:12:18.356
Stay away!

01:12:25.310 --> 01:12:29.158
Stay back, baby. Please go!

01:12:36.152 --> 01:12:37.152
Buddy, hey!

01:12:38.282 --> 01:12:40.524
Take her and leave.

01:12:41.552 --> 01:12:43.325
You have to go!

01:12:45.065 --> 01:12:46.265
I said go, douche!

01:12:48.418 --> 01:12:50.351
I'm getting tired, please go.

01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:57.149
Take care of her, okay?

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:02.134
I'll hold them off, just go!

01:13:12.136 --> 01:13:14.636
I'm sorry...

01:13:25.503 --> 01:13:27.504
We have to go, let's go!

01:13:29.519 --> 01:13:30.519
Yoon Su-yun!

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.188
Our baby's name!

01:13:36.230 --> 01:13:37.230
Got it?

01:15:37.466 --> 01:15:38.733
Why did you do it?!

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:42.338
You bastard!

01:15:44.476 --> 01:15:45.943
We could've save them!

01:15:48.642 --> 01:15:49.643
Why?!

01:15:50.815 --> 01:15:51.815
He's infected!

01:15:54.290 --> 01:15:55.424
He's one of them!

01:15:56.289 --> 01:15:57.623
This guy's infected!

01:15:58.132 --> 01:15:59.932
His eyes! Look at his eyes!

01:16:00.537 --> 01:16:02.204
He'll become one of them!

01:16:02.722 --> 01:16:04.323
Do you all want to die?!

01:16:04.707 --> 01:16:06.240
We must throw them out!

01:16:16.628 --> 01:16:19.812
Those of you who just arrived,

01:16:20.824 --> 01:16:23.157
I don't think you can stay with us.

01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:27.184
Please move to the vestibule.

01:16:42.332 --> 01:16:43.332
Just go!

01:16:48.156 --> 01:16:49.156
Get out!

01:16:54.767 --> 01:16:55.767
Get out now!

01:16:59.383 --> 01:17:00.383
Hurry up!

01:17:01.758 --> 01:17:02.758
Move!

01:17:04.543 --> 01:17:05.543
Go!

01:17:05.939 --> 01:17:06.939
Leave us!

01:17:09.103 --> 01:17:10.236
Get the hell out!

01:17:12.237 --> 01:17:13.237
Out now!

01:17:15.042 --> 01:17:16.042
Hurry!

01:17:20.195 --> 01:17:22.695
It'll be safer for you to stay here.

01:17:23.010 --> 01:17:25.751
No, I don't want to stay.

01:17:27.353 --> 01:17:28.502
I'm coming with you.

01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:29.607
But...

01:17:29.946 --> 01:17:31.079
Get the hell out!

01:17:31.804 --> 01:17:33.470
What are you waiting for!

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:35.484
Okay, let's go.

01:17:38.424 --> 01:17:40.388
Get out! Rest of you!

01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.221
Get out!

01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:44.015
Get out of here!

01:18:02.748 --> 01:18:03.748
Let's go.

01:18:41.463 --> 01:18:42.464
Tie it faster!

01:18:43.908 --> 01:18:45.011
More ties! Neckties!

01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:45.241
Shut up! I'm working on it!
More ties! Neckties!

01:18:45.242 --> 01:18:46.812
Shut up! I'm working on it!

01:19:03.598 --> 01:19:04.598
Yun In-gil

01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:06.426
Great name.

01:19:08.239 --> 01:19:11.884
Always helping others instead of yourself.

01:19:15.733 --> 01:19:18.082
Why did you live like that?

01:19:20.047 --> 01:19:22.047
What was the point?

01:19:23.406 --> 01:19:24.406
So stupid...

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:33.468
Shut up! Be quiet!

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.021
Stay in your seat!

01:19:37.241 --> 01:19:39.241
What a load of shit.

01:19:44.334 --> 01:19:46.734
Finish up and do the other side too.

01:19:57.832 --> 01:20:01.607
Thank you for everyting.

01:20:03.172 --> 01:20:04.127
That woman...

01:20:04.127 --> 01:20:04.170
Stop her!
That woman...

01:20:04.171 --> 01:20:05.171
Stop her!

01:20:59.696 --> 01:21:02.196
Control, this is Busan-bound 101!

01:21:02.197 --> 01:21:05.130
Requesting current
situation in Busan, over.

01:21:05.947 --> 01:21:06.947
Control?!

01:21:07.697 --> 01:21:08.697
Control!

01:22:35.648 --> 01:22:37.049
It's your birthday...

01:22:41.739 --> 01:22:42.739
Don't worry.

01:22:43.856 --> 01:22:46.256
I'll take you to mom no matter what.

01:22:49.889 --> 01:22:51.407
Aren't you scared?

01:22:57.423 --> 01:22:58.449
Of course I am.

01:23:00.738 --> 01:23:01.738
I'm scared too.

01:23:06.902 --> 01:23:07.969
I was so scared.

01:23:09.865 --> 01:23:12.132
I thought I'd never see you again.

01:23:15.014 --> 01:23:19.259
I practiced that song just for you.

01:23:24.325 --> 01:23:26.125
That's why I couldn't sing.

01:23:28.682 --> 01:23:30.349
Because I didn't see you.

01:23:37.452 --> 01:23:39.927
Will you stay with me?

01:23:56.028 --> 01:23:57.028
<i>Ex-wife</i>

01:24:08.532 --> 01:24:11.748
<i>The person you're calling is not available</i>

01:24:23.342 --> 01:24:24.342
<i>Analyst Kim</i>

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:29.691
Yes, Kim.

01:24:32.165 --> 01:24:33.898
<i>Have you arrived in Busan?</i>

01:24:33.942 --> 01:24:36.676
Not yet, where are you? Is it okay there?

01:24:38.522 --> 01:24:40.855
<i>Busan succeeded in initial defense.</i>

01:24:41.646 --> 01:24:42.779
What? You sure?

01:24:46.647 --> 01:24:47.779
Chief.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.779
We are the one who started this.

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:56.781
Our plant started all of this.

01:25:01.649 --> 01:25:03.409
- Chief.
- Please tell me it's not our fault.

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:10.783
We're only doing our jobs right?

01:25:12.749 --> 01:25:14.250
<i>Is this my fault?</i>

01:25:18.408 --> 01:25:19.408
It's...

01:25:20.568 --> 01:25:21.902
It's not your fault.

01:25:25.796 --> 01:25:26.796
<i>Thank you...</i>

01:25:29.297 --> 01:25:30.297
Kim...

01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:16.576
<i>Attention please.</i>

01:27:17.663 --> 01:27:21.094
<i>Due to a blockage on our track,</i>

01:27:21.798 --> 01:27:23.829
<i>we have stopped at East Daegu Station.</i>

01:27:23.967 --> 01:27:27.467
<i>We should either wait for the rescue team,</i>

01:27:27.661 --> 01:27:32.425
<i>or we'll have to reach
Busan in another train.</i>

01:27:33.615 --> 01:27:35.323
<i>As soon as I end this announcement,</i>

01:27:35.623 --> 01:27:41.213
<i>I will find a working train and
put it on left most track.</i>

01:27:41.477 --> 01:27:42.149
What's going on?

01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.544
<i>I repeat, left most track.
What's going on?</i>

01:27:42.545 --> 01:27:44.498
<i>I repeat, left most track.</i>

01:27:45.096 --> 01:27:49.610
If you're alive, please transfer safely.

01:27:51.443 --> 01:27:52.444
Godspeed.

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.394
Will there be a rescue?

01:29:03.540 --> 01:29:05.340
I heard that Busan is safe.

01:29:08.195 --> 01:29:09.528
We have to move now.

01:30:54.896 --> 01:30:55.896
Coast clear?

01:30:58.599 --> 01:30:59.599
Yeah.

01:31:02.918 --> 01:31:03.918
You go ahead.

01:31:28.712 --> 01:31:30.846
We've got to find a way across.

01:31:54.693 --> 01:31:55.693

01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:36.340

01:33:50.944 --> 01:33:51.944
Jin-hee!

01:34:03.757 --> 01:34:04.824
This can't be...

01:34:10.733 --> 01:34:11.733
I'm sorry...

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:43.445
Daddy! Wake up!

01:34:46.218 --> 01:34:50.156

01:41:40.556 --> 01:41:42.557
Please help me.

01:41:43.557 --> 01:41:45.557

01:41:55.558 --> 01:41:57.559
Please save me.

01:42:04.560 --> 01:42:09.560
You are already infected.

01:42:17.561 --> 01:42:25.562
No, no, no, no...

01:44:53.759 --> 01:44:54.839
Su-an comes here. Sit here.

01:44:58.760 --> 01:44:59.760
Listen to me...

01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:04.761
Here is the throttle, the brakes.

01:45:05.761 --> 01:45:07.760
When you need to stop

01:45:07.761 --> 01:45:10.761
Pull the break

01:45:13.762 --> 01:45:14.762
Su-an..

01:45:20.763 --> 01:45:25.763
Look at me...

01:45:26.763 --> 01:45:27.764
Su-an...

01:45:27.765 --> 01:45:29.764
Listen to me.

01:45:30.764 --> 01:45:34.764
You must stay with her, okay?

01:45:34.765 --> 01:45:40.765
Busan is still safe, that is why...
that is why... - Don't go!...

01:45:41.765 --> 01:45:44.766
-Don't go, Father!... Come with us.

01:45:46.766 --> 01:45:47.766
-Please don't leave me.

01:45:47.767 --> 01:45:49.767

I see something

01:51:41.813 --> 01:51:46.814
Approaching 2 subjects at our location.
Looks like a woman and a child.

01:51:48.814 --> 01:51:50.814
<i>Are you able to verify the subjects?</i>

01:51:54.815 --> 01:51:56.815
It's so dark on the other side

01:52:01.816 --> 01:52:03.816
I can't clearly see them

01:52:05.816 --> 01:52:09.817
Can't clearly see the
subjects, unable to verify.

01:52:11.817 --> 01:52:12.817
<i>Kill them.</i>

01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:41.821
<i>(CHILD SINGING)</i>

01:53:02.824 --> 01:53:04.824
