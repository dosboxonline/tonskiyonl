00:46.518 --> 00:51.089
The definition of love
is an intense feeling

00:51.089 --> 00:54.893
of affection and concern
toward another person.

00:56.661 --> 01:00.765
You know, now I have never
actually been in love,

01:02.033 --> 01:04.002
and Lord knows I've tried.

01:04.002 --> 01:05.036
No, that's not good.

01:05.036 --> 01:06.371
That's not good.

01:10.275 --> 01:15.280
Seeing love happen for
one of my closest friends,

01:16.781 --> 01:19.217
that has been just
a beautiful thing.

03:54.072 --> 03:56.241
You look like
The Little Mermaid.

04:04.716 --> 04:08.019
You know, now that there
is a ring on my finger,

04:09.454 --> 04:12.590
I have to ask, what
took you so long?

04:13.625 --> 04:15.460
Mm.

04:15.460 --> 04:16.294
I'm serious.

04:17.629 --> 04:19.497
I dunno.

04:19.497 --> 04:21.099
I guess just because it was
against university policy.

04:21.099 --> 04:22.634
Yeah, well that's
where we work.

04:22.634 --> 04:23.468
It's what we do.

04:23.468 --> 04:25.637
It's a job.

04:25.637 --> 04:27.472
And a job shouldn't
get to determine how
its employees live,

04:27.472 --> 04:28.973
as long as it doesn't
interfere with their work.

04:28.973 --> 04:30.108
They feel it does interfere.

04:30.108 --> 04:31.409
I mean, it makes sense.

04:32.810 --> 04:35.046
Everything gets
harder once emotions

04:35.046 --> 04:36.281
come into play, you know?

04:37.915 --> 04:39.784
That's why we
usually work alone.

04:39.784 --> 04:41.352
Usually.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.755
But we knew the policy
before we took the job.

04:45.256 --> 04:48.459
We were just kids
then, things change.

04:48.459 --> 04:49.627
People change.

04:49.627 --> 04:50.962
Yeah, but policy doesn't.

04:52.797 --> 04:57.335
You know, you are the
first partner I ever had.

04:58.536 --> 04:59.837
And the last.

05:24.862 --> 05:28.299
This all just feels
so surreal, you know?

05:29.334 --> 05:30.501
I don't want it to end.

05:34.572 --> 05:36.674
I hope it never has to.

05:40.978 --> 05:45.683
You know, I could really
use a drink right about now.

05:45.683 --> 05:47.185
I could always use a drink,

05:49.854 --> 05:51.322
and a dance.

05:51.322 --> 05:54.692
Oh, God, I'm an
awful dancer, you know?

05:54.692 --> 05:56.127
Don't I know it?

05:56.127 --> 05:57.428
Oh my God.

05:57.428 --> 05:59.564
She's a champagne queen here.

06:01.399 --> 06:04.068
Someone, please get this
woman a glass of champagne.

06:06.537 --> 06:07.705

It still tastes awful.

07:24.682 --> 07:26.284
Well I don't know

07:26.284 --> 07:28.219
You didn't even like

07:29.520 --> 07:31.055
I like that little umbrella.

07:38.162 --> 07:39.330
Excuse me.

07:39.330 --> 07:40.865
What can I get you, guys?

you want, margarita?

07:41.666 --> 07:42.667
Yeah.

Two margaritas. Rocks.

07:45.169 --> 07:46.270
Definitely with salt.

07:46.270 --> 07:47.638

07:47.638 --> 07:49.707
Mm-hmm, two

Honeymoon?

08:24.809 --> 08:25.910
Is it that obvious?

08:27.712 --> 08:30.882
He and I used to be
in love like that once.

08:30.882 --> 08:31.816
Did you say once?

08:31.816 --> 08:33.017
Yeah.

08:34.185 --> 08:36.153
Well, it does get better.

08:36.153 --> 08:38.055
Trust me, we should know.

08:38.055 --> 08:40.658
We got married 20
years ago today.

08:40.658 --> 08:43.761
Oh, well, happy
anniversary then.

08:43.761 --> 08:45.329
Congrats.

08:45.329 --> 08:47.365
I'm not gonna say it
hasn't been a long road.

08:47.365 --> 08:50.568
Well anything that's worth
the drive there is, yeah?

08:50.568 --> 08:51.402
That is true.

08:52.837 --> 08:54.472
How long are y'all
in Puerto Rico?

08:54.472 --> 08:57.508
Oh, it's our last day
tomorrow, unfortunately.

08:57.508 --> 08:59.377
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:59.377 --> 09:00.611
Back to reality, huh?

09:00.611 --> 09:03.781
Yeah, back to reality.

09:03.781 --> 09:05.516
It's been paradise, of course.

09:05.516 --> 09:06.517
No doubt.

09:06.517 --> 09:08.419
It's been great to...

09:08.419 --> 09:11.055
Somehow we have managed to
not get any fresh seafood

09:11.055 --> 09:12.223
since we've been here.

09:12.223 --> 09:14.625
Well ours here is excellent.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.194
We catch it fresh out of the
water right back there daily.

09:17.194 --> 09:20.431
Oh, well, what he means
is he hasn't had a chance

09:20.431 --> 09:22.266
to catch it himself yet.

09:22.266 --> 09:24.936
He likes to pretend
he knows how to fish.

09:24.936 --> 09:25.937
What?

09:25.937 --> 09:27.772
I know how to fish.

09:27.772 --> 09:29.974
What, do you think we don't
fish back in merry old England?

09:29.974 --> 09:31.342
Brilliant water.

09:31.342 --> 09:32.610
Beautiful views.

09:32.610 --> 09:33.911
It's the thrill of the chase.

09:33.911 --> 09:35.079
You know?

09:35.079 --> 09:36.881
That is a perfect holiday.

09:36.881 --> 09:40.084
And I have been fishing since
I was just a little lad.

09:40.084 --> 09:41.619
Well he always
liked to fish too,

09:41.619 --> 09:44.288
but I always found
it incredibly boring.

09:44.288 --> 09:46.757
I'd rather sew,
and I hate sewing.

09:48.626 --> 09:50.528
Well if you're looking
to do the fishing yourself

09:50.528 --> 09:53.064
I'd recommend going down the
harbor and renting a boat.

09:53.064 --> 09:54.899
Just go down there
and ask around

09:54.899 --> 09:57.735
and somebody will be
willing to take you out.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.236
Mm, thank you.

09:59.236 --> 10:02.206
Yeah, I can do that
if I'm allowed.

10:02.206 --> 10:03.808
They're allowed too.

10:03.808 --> 10:06.010
No, I mean,
if we have enough time.

10:06.010 --> 10:07.111
I mean.

10:07.111 --> 10:08.646
Oh.

10:08.646 --> 10:10.548
I'll tell you
what, love birds,

10:10.548 --> 10:12.850
these two old birds gotta get
back to the nest right now.

10:12.850 --> 10:14.418
- Aw.
- Aw.

10:14.418 --> 10:15.653
But we're taking
care of your drinks.

10:15.653 --> 10:16.487
Oh, no, no, no.

10:16.487 --> 10:17.955
Absolutely not.

10:17.955 --> 10:18.623
It's not necessary.
- My pleasure.

10:18.623 --> 10:20.558
Okay?

10:20.558 --> 10:22.126
You enjoy the rest of your
time here now, all right.

I could, but...

You were right, she's here.

I didn't even know
about the damn place.

19:13.223 --> 19:14.758
Hmm.

19:14.758 --> 19:16.393
I just wanna
talk to her first.

19:16.393 --> 19:17.861
Whatever you say, chief.

19:17.861 --> 19:19.997
I'll be
there as soon as I can.

19:38.815 --> 19:43.320
So he just, he wants us
to keep her here for now.

19:47.591 --> 19:49.193
He thinks
he's gonna get her back?

19:49.193 --> 19:52.396
Yeah, well, you know
our boy, he's in love.

19:52.396 --> 19:53.230
What can I say?

19:54.665 --> 19:56.533
And love makes you
do some crazy things.

19:56.533 --> 19:59.002
You know the definition

19:59.002 --> 20:02.539
of love is an intense
feeling of affection.

20:02.539 --> 20:04.441
"The definition of love."

20:04.441 --> 20:07.044
Is that from your
best man's speech?

20:07.044 --> 20:09.813
You're not gonna torture us
with that shit again, are you?

20:13.984 --> 20:15.385
You know, being
somebody's best man

20:15.385 --> 20:18.422
is a job I take very seriously.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.393
And I worked my fucking ass
off on that thing so, yeah.

20:23.393 --> 20:26.597
This is bullshit, you two
are arguing about a speech.

20:26.597 --> 20:27.764
We're chasing after her.

20:29.299 --> 20:32.035
Love is a liability.

20:42.079 --> 20:45.048
Speaking of love,
I got a match.

20:45.882 --> 20:47.718
She's hot too.

20:47.718 --> 20:49.720
I'm gonna marry this one.

20:49.720 --> 20:50.554
Mm.

20:51.622 --> 20:54.391
Guys, we need to focus.

20:54.391 --> 20:55.292
Focus.

20:56.793 --> 20:58.895
We got a bridezilla
killer on the loose

20:58.895 --> 21:01.732
somewhere around here.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.269
Wait a minute.

21:05.269 --> 21:07.671
Can't live with
'em, can't kill 'em.

our boy could do better.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.701

33:21.938 --> 33:24.540

to know where we could rent

33:24.540 --> 33:26.409
or charter a boat?

33:26.409 --> 33:28.177
Like the bartender
said last night.

33:31.514 --> 33:33.149

33:33.149 --> 33:34.350

33:34.350 --> 33:35.685
Yeah. No, not really.

33:37.086 --> 33:38.254

through, like you all,

33:38.254 --> 33:40.523

Hmm.

33:47.830 --> 33:49.032
I'll tell you what though,

33:50.400 --> 33:52.235
why don't you both
come out with us today?

33:52.235 --> 33:54.203

us on our boat.

33:55.204 --> 33:56.205

33:56.205 --> 33:58.041

are just here on vacation too.

34:09.085 --> 34:10.653

34:10.653 --> 34:12.188
It'd be great to have
some young blood around.

34:12.188 --> 34:13.589

ever have company.

34:14.757 --> 34:17.060

34:17.060 --> 34:20.196

wherever it takes us.

34:20.196 --> 34:21.664
Nowhere. Everywhere.

34:22.565 --> 34:23.566

34:24.867 --> 34:26.135

34:29.605 --> 34:30.440

go to the boat.

34:35.078 --> 34:36.546

34:36.546 --> 34:37.613

34:38.581 --> 34:39.682

34:42.151 --> 34:43.286

36:15.578 --> 36:18.214

36:18.214 --> 36:19.715

to have the night

36:19.715 --> 36:21.317

36:22.718 --> 36:24.987
Looks like you already
made your decision.

36:24.987 --> 36:25.988
Hmm.

36:25.988 --> 36:26.789
I'm working on it.

36:28.257 --> 36:29.992
You know, he told
us not to hurt you.

36:29.992 --> 36:32.195
He told you not to hurt me?

40:36.272 --> 40:37.440
Get up, bitch.

40:37.440 --> 40:39.575

40:39.575 --> 40:41.477
You wanna play with the doggy?

Woof.

40:43.312 --> 40:44.447

40:44.447 --> 40:45.781
Shut up.

40:45.781 --> 40:46.782
Come on.

40:46.782 --> 40:48.684
Huh?

40:48.684 --> 40:50.853

40:51.854 --> 40:54.790
Come on.

40:55.758 --> 40:57.159
Yeah, show me that leg.

40:57.159 --> 40:58.527
Show me that leg.

40:58.527 --> 41:01.597
Come on, I'm ready, pussy cat.

41:01.597 --> 41:03.966
Too bad, I really liked you.

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Not yet?

The game has changed, motherfucker.

42:53.375 --> 42:55.778
It was her that threw
the kill switch.

42:55.778 --> 42:57.279
She threw the panel lights.

42:57.279 --> 42:59.782
Okay, but, but what
about our friends?

42:59.782 --> 43:00.950
Right?

43:00.950 --> 43:02.952
Oh, what about our friends?

They're gone.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.354
Maybe you don't even
give a shit about them,

43:05.354 --> 43:07.222
but I still do.

43:07.222 --> 43:10.759

for they will be missed.

43:20.736 --> 43:22.271
Mm.

43:22.271 --> 43:24.106
You know, those
are the two people

43:24.106 --> 43:27.142
that we could actually
talk to about what we do.

43:27.142 --> 43:28.644
We should've had the day off.

43:28.644 --> 43:31.647
We should be enjoying
ourselves tonight.

43:31.647 --> 43:33.482
Okay?

43:33.482 --> 43:35.284
So instead we will give
them a motherfucking toast.

44:04.580 --> 44:06.281
I'm sure as shit not
having any fucking fun.

44:07.616 --> 44:09.785
Oh, speak for yourself.

44:09.785 --> 44:13.522
I mean, he is our friend and
he would do the same for us.

44:14.890 --> 44:17.126
Yeah, well I'm
supposed to be drunk,

44:17.126 --> 44:19.995
getting my groove on with one
of the bridesmaids right now.

And whose fault is that?

44:27.603 --> 44:28.437
Hm?

44:38.147 --> 44:39.148
We trained together.

44:41.383 --> 44:42.885
Shared secrets.

44:43.986 --> 44:46.655
God, man, I love those guys.

44:46.655 --> 44:48.924
They're like my brothers.

44:51.927 --> 44:52.928
You know, love.

44:54.396 --> 44:56.231
You know, it's an
intense feeling

44:56.231 --> 45:01.236
of affection and concern
toward another human being.

45:02.337 --> 45:03.172
Me?

45:04.673 --> 45:06.208
I haven't been in love.

45:08.210 --> 45:09.511
No.

45:09.511 --> 45:10.946
Come on, man.

45:10.946 --> 45:12.781
Not this fucking
speech again, please.

45:12.781 --> 45:16.385
I am doing this to honor them.

45:19.421 --> 45:20.889
They would want to hear it.

45:21.957 --> 45:22.791
Okay?

45:24.226 --> 45:27.763
But seeing love happen,

45:30.132 --> 45:31.734
especially with one of
your closest friends,

45:31.734 --> 45:34.369
it is a beautiful thing.

45:35.337 --> 45:37.139
It really is.

45:37.139 --> 45:41.410
Now, when I was asked to
give the best man's speech,

45:41.410 --> 45:45.247
I can't say I was surprised.

45:45.247 --> 45:48.984
I mean, I killed a
lot of people to prove

45:48.984 --> 45:50.919
that I was the best.

45:50.919 --> 45:51.920
Right?

45:51.920 --> 45:53.255
I kid. I kid.

45:53.255 --> 45:54.623
I kid.

45:54.623 --> 45:56.291
Oh, wow.

45:58.093 --> 46:02.431
Seriously though, welcome
to our joyous occasion.

46:04.833 --> 46:05.834
In my name...

46:11.707 --> 46:12.541
Ooh.

46:13.976 --> 46:16.078
All right, we'll
finish this later.

46:16.078 --> 46:21.083
To those that have fallen and
those that are still standing.

46:23.485 --> 46:24.319
Hmm?

46:29.491 --> 46:30.659
Cheers.

46:35.497 --> 46:39.468
I mean, that is
one crazy story.

46:39.468 --> 46:42.037
And I can't believe y'all
are still together now.

46:43.839 --> 46:46.475
It sounds like you guys had
it even rougher than we did.

46:48.210 --> 46:50.112
Yeah, well, what can I say?

46:51.847 --> 46:54.583
A lot of people had to
die for us to be together.

46:55.651 --> 46:57.653
It sounds like it.

46:57.653 --> 46:59.054
Where'd you bury the bodies?

47:00.322 --> 47:01.156
Backyard?

47:04.893 --> 47:06.461
Yeah, well,
nobody really knows

47:06.461 --> 47:08.664
what goes on behind
closed doors, do they?

47:08.664 --> 47:12.201
No, they do not.

47:12.201 --> 47:13.702
- Stop it.
- No, but seriously

47:13.702 --> 47:16.772
he was crazy and
she deserved better.

47:16.772 --> 47:19.007
Don't know that she got
that, but here I am.

47:19.007 --> 47:20.008
Thank you, honey.

47:22.211 --> 47:23.345
So what about you two?

47:24.246 --> 47:25.914
How did you guys meet?

47:29.184 --> 47:31.220
Well, that's a long story.

47:32.154 --> 47:33.922
But I'll tell you what,

47:33.922 --> 47:37.092
there were a lot of people
didn't want us together neither.

47:38.227 --> 47:39.728
Yeah.

47:39.728 --> 47:40.929
That was a lot of
years ago now though.

47:40.929 --> 47:42.497
- Yeah.
- Right?

47:42.497 --> 47:44.099
20 years.

47:44.099 --> 47:45.100
Love conquers all.

47:46.535 --> 47:48.503
Now we just go wherever
our hearts lead us.

47:50.372 --> 47:52.241
Wow.

47:52.241 --> 47:55.043
Do you ever have any friends
or family come visit you?

47:55.043 --> 47:57.045
No. No.

47:57.045 --> 47:57.946
Unfortunately.

47:59.014 --> 48:01.750
But mostly, fortunately.

48:03.485 --> 48:04.753
We were gonna tell the museum.

48:11.727 --> 48:12.828
I gotta cook.

48:18.200 --> 48:21.436
Now that's definitely a
lifestyle I could get behind.

48:21.436 --> 48:23.071
What do you think?

48:43.759 --> 48:45.093
What about you guys?

48:45.093 --> 48:46.995
Anything you miss?

48:46.995 --> 48:49.431
Do you ever have
any regrets maybe?

48:49.431 --> 48:52.301
Just that we
never had children.

48:52.301 --> 48:53.969
Yeah.

48:53.969 --> 48:56.338
No way to go on once we're gone.

48:57.940 --> 48:59.975
Not to try and dig
too deep or anything

48:59.975 --> 49:02.544
but is that because you
didn't wanna have any,

49:02.544 --> 49:04.880
or you couldn't?

49:04.880 --> 49:06.648
Oh, we could.

49:06.648 --> 49:10.819
We want to but it just
didn't really make sense

49:10.819 --> 49:12.721
when we look at our way of life.

49:12.721 --> 49:14.456
What do you mean?

49:14.456 --> 49:15.624
I don't know.

49:15.624 --> 49:17.726
Just we both worked a lot.

49:17.726 --> 49:18.727
Both stressed.

49:20.195 --> 49:21.797
Both traveling for
work all the time.

49:21.797 --> 49:24.166
Both had a demanding job.

49:26.101 --> 49:27.336
Well it looks like
it all worked out

49:27.336 --> 49:28.971
for you guys in the end.

49:28.971 --> 49:30.339
We have a good life.

49:30.339 --> 49:32.441
Yeah, we do.

49:32.441 --> 49:34.176
We have our ups and
downs like everyone,

49:34.176 --> 49:35.377
but I wouldn't
trade for the world.

49:35.377 --> 49:37.612
Trust me, no, no, no.

49:37.612 --> 49:40.115
You know, I learned
a lot about life.

49:40.115 --> 49:41.950
Everything I did, you know?

49:41.950 --> 49:43.518
But that's what life is, right?

49:43.518 --> 49:45.354
It's about learning.

49:45.354 --> 49:48.790
Got respect, honor, endurance.

49:50.525 --> 49:53.195
Everything I did taught me
what I needed to know to live

49:54.129 --> 49:55.597
right up to this moment.

49:58.333 --> 50:00.936
And what about that
scar on your shoulder?

50:01.937 --> 50:03.138
What did that teach you?

50:09.945 --> 50:11.613
You don't
have to talk about it,

50:11.613 --> 50:12.981
if you don't want to.

50:12.981 --> 50:14.716
Oh, no, no, no, no.

50:16.618 --> 50:18.854
It's good knowing when
you're close to death.

50:20.222 --> 50:21.423
Makes you not
forget how to live.

50:24.993 --> 50:27.829
August 7th, 1986.

50:30.732 --> 50:33.001
That's the day that
changed my life forever.

50:33.001 --> 50:36.705
Eight of us, all sent on
foreign soil to take out

50:36.705 --> 50:39.408
some high ranking
official over there.

50:40.675 --> 50:42.244
Fed a bunch of lies.

50:42.244 --> 50:44.713
That's often the way
to justify actions.

50:46.415 --> 50:47.682
You never question above.

50:48.583 --> 50:49.451
Not back then.

50:51.820 --> 50:54.523
He said it was supposed to
be a quick, easy in and out.

50:54.523 --> 50:55.690
And we believed him.

50:55.690 --> 50:57.225
You know?

50:57.225 --> 50:58.260
But the thing was...

51:00.762 --> 51:04.399
The eight of us, we were
among the best at what we did.

51:04.399 --> 51:07.402
But we never worked together.

51:09.104 --> 51:10.238
I mean, not as a team.

51:11.907 --> 51:14.042
I mean, we'd hung out together.

51:14.042 --> 51:15.477
We drank beers together.

51:16.945 --> 51:18.547
We trained together,
respected each other.

51:20.949 --> 51:23.085
We was all the best of
friends, is what we were.

51:24.886 --> 51:27.756
I mean we always, we
always worked alone.

51:29.791 --> 51:31.860
That's how it was preferred.

51:31.860 --> 51:33.028
Always.

51:33.028 --> 51:34.563
That's how we preferred it.

51:34.563 --> 51:37.099
You know, we were
all good enough

51:37.099 --> 51:40.235
that we could do whatever
we needed to do alone.

51:41.703 --> 51:43.939
One man, that person,
he can slip in and out,

51:43.939 --> 51:45.974
but you bring a group, all of
a sudden that's gonna bring

51:45.974 --> 51:47.509
a lot of attention.

51:47.509 --> 51:49.311
And that's exactly what
happened on that day,

51:50.745 --> 51:52.781
August 7th, 1986.

51:55.317 --> 51:57.085
See, instead of
being on offense,

51:58.153 --> 52:00.755
we found ourselves on defense.

52:03.291 --> 52:05.760
Might as well have been the
4th of July in that room.

52:05.760 --> 52:06.795
We were...

52:07.662 --> 52:08.497
Bang.

52:10.932 --> 52:12.601
Bows flying all over the place.

52:15.170 --> 52:17.506
Ringing.

52:17.506 --> 52:20.642
That's the kind of ringing
don't leave your head either.

52:20.642 --> 52:21.810
It's the kind of
ringing that wake you up

52:21.810 --> 52:25.847
in the middle of night today.

52:29.151 --> 52:30.519
Yeah, they was my brothers.

52:32.654 --> 52:35.323
There's no way to erase the
sight of watching your brother

52:35.323 --> 52:36.825
take his last breath.

52:36.825 --> 52:39.794
And my night, that was me.

52:41.296 --> 52:42.297
Seven times.

52:44.099 --> 52:46.134
See, I was the only
one to make it back.

52:52.207 --> 52:53.141
Oh, shotgun.

52:54.409 --> 52:55.243
Shoulder.

52:56.344 --> 52:57.546
But I survived it.

52:59.514 --> 53:02.417
August 7th, 1986.

53:06.521 --> 53:07.789
What a goddamn day.

53:12.360 --> 53:13.195
I'm sorry.

53:14.663 --> 53:16.398
Sometimes you
lose your closest,

53:17.866 --> 53:19.834
'cause that's what
happens at war.

53:19.834 --> 53:20.669
Right?

53:21.736 --> 53:22.871
But you know the funny thing?

53:24.673 --> 53:28.410
Back then, usually the
day before you went off

53:28.410 --> 53:30.378
on the day before, you went
and you had a bachelor party.

53:30.378 --> 53:31.213
Right?

53:32.981 --> 53:36.985
I didn't have anyone left to
throw mine on August 8th, 1986.

53:43.058 --> 53:48.063
But that did not
stop me from marrying

53:49.864 --> 53:53.568
the most beautiful woman in
the world on August 9th, 1986.

53:53.568 --> 53:55.537
The happiest day of my life.

54:01.876 --> 54:03.645
This is it.

54:03.645 --> 54:07.482
Everything I've done has taught
me what I needed to learn

54:08.950 --> 54:12.587
to live right here
in this moment.

54:14.055 --> 54:15.757
Now, enough of all
this dark stuff.

54:15.757 --> 54:17.292
Right?

54:17.292 --> 54:19.094
This is a honeymoon, I thought.

54:20.195 --> 54:22.764
We are in paradise, take a look.

54:22.764 --> 54:25.634
Look at water and
we got islands.

54:27.235 --> 54:28.303
You two go and have some fun.

54:28.303 --> 54:29.471
All right?

54:29.471 --> 54:31.239
Take advantage of this ride.

54:31.239 --> 54:33.341
Well that sounds like
a great idea to me.

54:48.089 --> 54:49.824
I can help you carry
some of that stuff out.

Easy, there, tiger.

56:09.404 --> 56:12.207
Okay, maybe she's
just fucking with us.

56:12.207 --> 56:13.742
Right?

56:13.742 --> 56:16.578
And maybe she's still
upstairs right now.

56:16.578 --> 56:18.146
Hmm?

56:18.146 --> 56:19.180
I mean, regardless,
we will find out.

56:20.081 --> 56:22.150
I love our dear groom.

56:22.150 --> 56:23.318
I really do.

56:23.318 --> 56:24.853
I do.

56:24.853 --> 56:26.388
I'm the best man,
of course I do.

56:26.388 --> 56:30.425
But this wedding is
officially called off.

56:32.227 --> 56:33.695
So are you saying we're
cool with a killer now?

56:33.695 --> 56:35.063
Well we're not
gonna sit around here

56:35.063 --> 56:37.098
and let her kill us.

56:37.098 --> 56:37.932
Are we?

56:39.634 --> 56:41.770
Yeah, I'm not down
for her killing us.

56:41.770 --> 56:43.471
That's for damn sure.

56:43.471 --> 56:45.540
Yo, he's gonna
be pissed though.

56:45.540 --> 56:46.775
Oh, God.

56:46.775 --> 56:50.278
It's for his own good, and ours.

56:50.278 --> 56:53.014
Since you're the best
man, you can tell him

56:53.014 --> 56:54.816
we killed his bride.

56:54.816 --> 56:56.184
I am the best man.

56:57.051 --> 56:57.886
And I will.

56:59.220 --> 57:01.122
You know what?

57:01.122 --> 57:04.092
Let's make this a little
more fun, shall we?

57:04.092 --> 57:05.627
Huh?

57:05.627 --> 57:07.829
Okay, we're gonna
call this mission...

57:07.829 --> 57:09.297
I got it. I got it.

57:09.297 --> 57:11.800
Showdown at the family cabin.

57:13.234 --> 57:15.437
Whoever gets to her
first wins the honeymoon

57:15.437 --> 57:17.939
that I purchased for
the happy couple.

57:17.939 --> 57:21.609
Yeah, but you probably pick
some bougie shit like Paris.

57:21.609 --> 57:23.578
So cliche.

57:24.479 --> 57:26.214
Puerto Rico, my friend.

57:27.649 --> 57:29.451
I
love Puerto Rico.

57:29.451 --> 57:32.120
I bet you do.

57:32.120 --> 57:32.954
So...

57:35.256 --> 57:39.093
You, why don't you
take the upstairs.

57:39.093 --> 57:40.829
In case it was a diversion.

57:40.829 --> 57:44.399
You can fuck off to the
basement, in case she's hiding.

57:44.399 --> 57:46.768
And we shall take the front,

57:46.768 --> 57:48.970
make sure she doesn't
get one of those cars.

57:48.970 --> 57:50.338
Right?

57:50.338 --> 57:51.840
- Right.
- Come on.

58:09.424 --> 58:10.358
Okay, which way to go.

58:10.358 --> 58:11.426
Which way to go.

58:12.794 --> 58:14.662
Actually, you take,
you take left.

58:14.662 --> 58:15.797
Yeah, you.

58:15.797 --> 58:16.631
Yeah, all right.

58:16.631 --> 58:18.099
Nah.

58:18.099 --> 58:20.034
Nah, you take
right, I lean left.

58:20.034 --> 58:20.869
Okay?

58:21.703 --> 58:22.837
Right?

58:22.837 --> 58:24.572
Focus, motherfucker.

58:24.572 --> 58:25.707
Focus. Focus.

58:25.707 --> 58:26.975
Mm, they're watching.

58:35.450 --> 58:36.351
Sweetheart?

58:37.852 --> 58:39.020
Where are you?

58:40.655 --> 58:43.825
I'm missing my dancing partner.

58:43.825 --> 58:44.659
Come on.

58:49.664 --> 58:52.200
Yeah, sure.

58:53.935 --> 58:58.406
Got me out here looking for
her crazy ass by myself.

58:59.741 --> 59:01.376

59:11.953 --> 59:14.222

out, and nobody gets out.

I know, I know, it's, it's
cliche, but you know too much.

01:07:00.788 --> 01:07:04.358
Hell, we all know
a little too much.

01:07:05.826 --> 01:07:09.063

the policy, right?

01:07:09.063 --> 01:07:10.364

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:11.198

01:07:37.725 --> 01:07:39.360
Where do you think you're going?

01:07:41.262 --> 01:07:45.232
Since it's your wedding day,
we will wait for the groom.

01:07:45.232 --> 01:07:46.834
All right?

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:51.005
But if I wasn't such
an amazing best man

01:07:52.706 --> 01:07:54.942
I would just cut your
fucking head off right now.

01:07:54.942 --> 01:07:56.477
Okay?

01:07:56.477 --> 01:08:00.781
You can, I guess, get
the rest of her inside.

01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:04.452
We'll let the two
love birds discuss

01:08:04.452 --> 01:08:07.254
and he can decide what
he wants to do with her.

01:08:07.254 --> 01:08:08.089
In the meantime,

01:08:09.156 --> 01:08:10.257
I shall have another toast

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:13.861
and work on my best man speech.

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:16.897
Because you never know,
could be a wedding day.

01:08:18.265 --> 01:08:22.603
Woo, so excited.

01:08:22.603 --> 01:08:27.608
Asshole, make the black
man pick up the garbage.

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:31.045

Oh, you see, friend, I
don't wanna have to be given

01:11:26.654 --> 01:11:27.521
anything anymore.

01:11:28.989 --> 01:11:30.991

I mean, you could get rid
of all of us, you know?

01:11:42.136 --> 01:11:44.805
But they will just send more.

01:11:44.805 --> 01:11:47.474
And next time you won't
even know who they are

01:11:47.474 --> 01:11:52.479
because this school, oh, this
school is old school baby.

01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.948
It is old school.

01:11:54.948 --> 01:11:56.517
I mean, they've been
around long before us,

01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:58.552
and they will be
here long after.

01:11:58.552 --> 01:11:59.787
Okay?

01:11:59.787 --> 01:12:02.022
I mean, you just don't suddenly

01:12:02.022 --> 01:12:05.459
up and decide you wanna
have a normal life

01:12:05.459 --> 01:12:08.729
when you teach at the
shadowy organization

01:12:08.729 --> 01:12:10.731
that subcontracts assassinations

01:12:10.731 --> 01:12:12.466
to every world
fucking government.

01:12:12.466 --> 01:12:13.300

01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.134
Enough.

01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:18.872
Thanks for the history
lesson, professor.

01:12:20.674 --> 01:12:23.477
But at least I'm making it my
choice to take that chance.

01:12:23.477 --> 01:12:25.412
Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:25.412 --> 01:12:26.880
You know what?

01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:28.315
He is coming.

01:12:28.315 --> 01:12:31.151
He is coming here.

01:12:42.296 --> 01:12:43.997
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:12:43.997 --> 01:12:44.898
Okay. Okay.

01:12:46.367 --> 01:12:48.969
Okay, he was gonna go
talk to the board first

01:12:48.969 --> 01:12:50.137
before he came here.

01:12:50.137 --> 01:12:51.905
Okay. Easy.

01:12:51.905 --> 01:12:53.407
Easy. Now.

01:12:53.407 --> 01:12:54.241
Easy.

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:59.246
I'm just be surprised if
he's not on his way already.

01:12:59.246 --> 01:13:00.147
Okay?

01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:01.715
Listen. Listen.

01:13:01.715 --> 01:13:03.450
He's still helping you.

01:13:04.351 --> 01:13:06.253
Whoa. Easy.

01:13:06.253 --> 01:13:09.757
Still helping you after
everything that you've done.

01:13:12.159 --> 01:13:15.429
It's sad, as the best
man, that you're breaking

01:13:15.429 --> 01:13:16.530
my boy's fucking heart.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:18.365
You know that, right?

01:13:18.365 --> 01:13:19.933
You know that.

01:13:19.933 --> 01:13:20.934
Well maybe I should
have never even tried

01:13:20.934 --> 01:13:22.202
to go through with it.

01:13:24.004 --> 01:13:27.808
But by the time I realized
it was already too late,

01:13:29.176 --> 01:13:31.378
the train was already
on the tracks.

01:13:37.584 --> 01:13:40.187
Come here.

01:13:40.187 --> 01:13:41.255
Okay.

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:43.424
You're a killer.

01:13:43.424 --> 01:13:44.491
I'm a killer.

01:13:45.626 --> 01:13:47.294
And I will kill you.

01:13:49.129 --> 01:13:52.232
I've already killed most of
our fucking friends tonight.

01:13:52.232 --> 01:13:54.902
Yeah, I see that and
I really appreciate it.

01:13:54.902 --> 01:13:55.736
Yeah.

01:13:57.237 --> 01:13:58.071
Call him.

01:13:59.506 --> 01:14:01.141
What?

01:14:01.141 --> 01:14:02.643
The one we both
still have left.

01:14:02.643 --> 01:14:04.211
Oh God.

01:14:04.211 --> 01:14:06.513
Yeah, I want you, I
want you to pull out

01:14:06.513 --> 01:14:09.650
your phone slowly and
I want you to call him

01:14:09.650 --> 01:14:12.119
and I want you to
tell him that I'm dead

01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.989
and that he doesn't have
to come here anymore.

01:14:17.925 --> 01:14:19.326
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:19.326 --> 01:14:20.327
What?

01:14:20.327 --> 01:14:22.930
You want me to call him

01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:26.934
and tell him his best man
killed his bride to be?

01:14:26.934 --> 01:14:28.836
Come on, he would be so
fucking pissed at me.

01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:29.837
I can't do it.

01:14:29.837 --> 01:14:31.972
No fucking way.

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:33.173
Oh.

01:14:33.173 --> 01:14:35.108
Sh.

01:14:35.108 --> 01:14:37.511
Are you more worried about
pissing him off right now?

01:14:38.846 --> 01:14:40.981
Or pissing me off more?

01:14:42.316 --> 01:14:44.418
You, darling, of course.

01:14:44.418 --> 01:14:45.419
Definitely.

01:14:45.419 --> 01:14:47.020
Then fucking call him.

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.723
All right, all
right, all right.

01:14:49.723 --> 01:14:51.492

What's going on?

01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:06.373
I just got back from the Dean's,
everything's cool for now.

01:15:06.373 --> 01:15:07.341
I'm just about to head that way.

01:15:07.341 --> 01:15:08.175
Where is she?

01:15:09.109 --> 01:15:11.011
Ah, she's dead.

01:15:15.482 --> 01:15:16.917
Do you hear what I said?

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:19.353
I said that she is dead.

01:15:19.353 --> 01:15:20.988
You killed her?

01:15:20.988 --> 01:15:23.557
I mean, I didn't
really have a choice.

01:15:23.557 --> 01:15:24.825
I mean, you know how she is.

01:15:24.825 --> 01:15:27.528
And she took out
every other guy.

01:15:27.528 --> 01:15:28.529
So-

01:15:28.529 --> 01:15:30.063
All of them?

01:15:30.063 --> 01:15:31.565
Well, I mean, shit
man, I just, you know,

01:15:31.565 --> 01:15:33.834
I had to kill her
before she killed me.

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:37.304
But listen, listen, if
it's any consolation

01:15:37.304 --> 01:15:41.475
she was one tough bitch.

01:15:42.309 --> 01:15:43.477
You know?

01:15:43.477 --> 01:15:44.411
But I am sorry about everything.

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:08.168
He hung up.

01:16:08.168 --> 01:16:09.636
So...

01:16:09.636 --> 01:16:11.538
But listen, I, you know,
while we're waiting

01:16:11.538 --> 01:16:14.575
for him I should give you
the speech that I prepared.

01:16:14.575 --> 01:16:16.710
I worked my ass off on it.

01:16:17.911 --> 01:16:19.813
You know the definition of love-

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:35.929
Hey, bitch.

01:16:39.766 --> 01:16:41.435
I ain't finished with you yet.

01:16:41.435 --> 01:16:45.372
God, not you again.

01:16:45.372 --> 01:16:47.574
Oh, looks like
everyone is dead.

01:16:48.642 --> 01:16:50.844
Good, they were weak.

01:16:51.945 --> 01:16:53.981
I was supposed to be best man.

01:16:53.981 --> 01:16:55.215
Huh?

01:16:55.215 --> 01:16:56.450
You caught me slipping.

01:16:57.851 --> 01:16:59.486
It ain't happening again.

01:16:59.486 --> 01:17:00.821
How was your flight?

01:17:01.955 --> 01:17:02.789
It was rough.

01:17:03.690 --> 01:17:05.692
But I'm here, ain't I?

01:17:05.692 --> 01:17:07.561
I guess you came
back for more.

01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:09.162
You ready for round two?

01:17:09.162 --> 01:17:10.697
Are you ready?

01:17:10.697 --> 01:17:12.866
I'm gonna rip your
fucking head off.

01:17:12.866 --> 01:17:14.501
And you're gonna regret this.

01:17:14.501 --> 01:17:15.335
Whoa.

01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:18.705
Whoa.

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.842
Wow.

01:17:21.842 --> 01:17:24.645
I'm gonna beat you like
your daddy used to.

01:17:24.645 --> 01:17:25.979
Come on.

01:17:25.979 --> 01:17:27.581
Come on, bitch.

01:17:27.581 --> 01:17:28.949
What did you just call me?

01:17:30.017 --> 01:17:31.885
What did it sound like?

01:17:31.885 --> 01:17:33.186
A female dog?

01:17:33.186 --> 01:17:34.821
Come on, bitch.

01:17:34.821 --> 01:17:38.358
Don't you ever call
me a bitch again.

01:17:39.459 --> 01:17:41.061
Fuck you.

01:17:41.061 --> 01:17:42.195
Come on, bitch.

01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:01.682
What the fuck?

01:18:02.749 --> 01:18:04.685
What the actual fuck?

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:09.623
You better let me go
right now you fucking...

01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:11.992
I'm sorry.

01:18:14.061 --> 01:18:15.295
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.295 --> 01:18:16.930
This is actually really good.

01:18:16.930 --> 01:18:18.932
This is good.

01:18:18.932 --> 01:18:19.933
We're in a good place right now.

01:18:19.933 --> 01:18:21.101
You know.

01:18:21.101 --> 01:18:23.103
Me and you we're a lot alike.

01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:24.638
We are.

01:18:24.638 --> 01:18:27.074
All the fighting and killing.

01:18:27.074 --> 01:18:28.775
It's exhausting.

01:18:28.775 --> 01:18:29.710
I'm over it.

01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:31.178
I'm done.

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.846
You want out?

01:18:32.846 --> 01:18:33.780
So do I.

01:18:34.715 --> 01:18:36.083
So do I.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:37.017
Yo, this is perfect.

01:18:37.017 --> 01:18:38.051
We could...

01:18:38.051 --> 01:18:38.952
We could just...

01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:41.188
We could just leave.

01:18:41.188 --> 01:18:42.355
Yeah?

01:18:42.355 --> 01:18:43.490
We could just leave.

01:18:44.858 --> 01:18:46.760
You and I, we could
just run away.

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.361
I mean, not together.

01:18:49.696 --> 01:18:51.665
Unless, unless
that's what you want.

01:18:51.665 --> 01:18:54.601
I always, I always thought that
you were, you were special.

01:18:56.069 --> 01:18:57.237
I...

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.338
I always had a crush on you.

01:19:01.408 --> 01:19:02.743
No, no.

01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:04.544
No.

01:19:04.544 --> 01:19:05.412
Okay, you could, you
could just go by yourself.

01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.149
You could just fucking
leave yourself.

01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:10.717
Get me the fuck outta here.

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:12.552
Cut me loose and we
can go toe to toe

01:19:12.552 --> 01:19:14.554
you fucking bitch.

01:19:14.554 --> 01:19:16.890
Let me fucking go.

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:19.126
Oh God, I will destroy you.

01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:21.595
God damn it.

01:19:22.696 --> 01:19:24.998
Fuck, I'll destroy you, bitch.

01:19:24.998 --> 01:19:26.900
Yeah.

01:19:26.900 --> 01:19:28.435
Everyone says that you're
supposed to be the best.

01:19:28.435 --> 01:19:29.770
Ah, the sweet little girl.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:30.837
The best.

01:19:30.837 --> 01:19:32.005
It's fucking bullshit.

01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:33.573
You're a fucking joke.

01:19:33.573 --> 01:19:35.075
Look at you, you're
fucking pathetic.

01:19:35.075 --> 01:19:36.810
You fucking bitch.

01:19:39.379 --> 01:19:42.783
That thing doesn't even
fucking work you stupid cunt.

01:19:46.086 --> 01:19:47.287
Nice legs though.

01:19:47.287 --> 01:19:49.189
Really, nice legs.

01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:50.857
Yeah.

01:19:52.726 --> 01:19:55.328
When you tried to kill me
earlier you forgot the gas.

01:20:01.201 --> 01:20:02.035
Fuck.

01:20:03.436 --> 01:20:04.437
Fuck.

01:21:34.527 --> 01:21:35.862
You didn't read up
on the assignment

01:21:35.862 --> 01:21:37.864
very well then, did you?

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:42.435
Wow, I didn't even
know people ate shark.

01:21:42.435 --> 01:21:43.870
But it was great.

01:21:44.771 --> 01:21:46.139
Well, you can do it.

01:21:46.139 --> 01:21:48.108
A lot of variables.

01:21:48.108 --> 01:21:50.944
You got species
of the shark, age,

01:21:52.045 --> 01:21:53.680
how fast you could bleed it out.

01:21:55.382 --> 01:21:56.883
Yeah, well we never
fished shark back in London.

01:21:56.883 --> 01:21:57.717
That's for sure.

01:21:59.786 --> 01:22:02.222
Because people are
scared of sharks.

01:22:02.222 --> 01:22:03.523
Fierce, fierce predators.

01:22:05.592 --> 01:22:08.862
Let me ask you, you
both afraid of sharks?

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:15.602
You see I equate the situation
we have here right now

01:22:17.404 --> 01:22:20.707
to the relationship with
the shark and the dolphin.

01:22:20.707 --> 01:22:24.344
You see the shark and the
dolphin tend to inhabit

01:22:24.344 --> 01:22:25.312
the same region.

01:22:26.980 --> 01:22:29.316
They can be copacetic,
live together, be happy.

01:22:31.117 --> 01:22:34.421
But all it takes is
for one bad shark

01:22:35.622 --> 01:22:37.624
and that turns the tide.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:41.494
And then it ruins
it for everybody.

01:22:42.963 --> 01:22:46.766
See a dolphin, you got
a lot to offer the shark

01:22:46.766 --> 01:22:48.601
in the way of the food chain.

01:22:48.601 --> 01:22:49.836
Big food source.

01:22:50.937 --> 01:22:52.973
Now the shark on the other hand,

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:56.843
he got absolutely nothing
to offer that dolphin.

01:22:58.478 --> 01:22:59.846
Everybody knows a shark,

01:23:01.348 --> 01:23:03.116
he could rip right
into that dolphin.

01:23:03.116 --> 01:23:04.651
Can't he?

01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:07.387
But the dolphin, he
don't have that luxury.

01:23:09.055 --> 01:23:13.293
No, the dolphin, he
gotta stay with the pack

01:23:13.293 --> 01:23:17.664
and swim around that shark
and try to confuse him.

01:23:19.332 --> 01:23:22.168
Now when he least expect
it, without any warning,

01:23:22.168 --> 01:23:27.073
that dolphin, he surprises
him by swimming up underneath

01:23:28.842 --> 01:23:31.378
and he ram that nose right
into that shark belly

01:23:33.713 --> 01:23:37.217
and kill the shark
with one good blow.

01:23:38.785 --> 01:23:39.619
That's a fact.

01:23:41.187 --> 01:23:42.022
So...

01:23:45.792 --> 01:23:48.194
I bring this up incidentally,

01:23:51.164 --> 01:23:54.200
because this is
where I find myself

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:57.904
and my wife this current moment.

01:23:59.406 --> 01:24:01.374
And we need to know,
we'd like to know,

01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:05.678
are we the shark?

01:24:08.648 --> 01:24:09.816
Are we the dolphin?

01:24:25.999 --> 01:24:31.004
See the dolphin, he's got
no reason to kill the shark.

01:24:35.608 --> 01:24:36.776
Unless it's defense.

01:24:38.578 --> 01:24:42.148
And that is the position I do
believe that I find my wife

01:24:42.148 --> 01:24:44.484
and myself currently
in right now.

01:24:46.486 --> 01:24:49.756
Now dolphins have been
known to play with sharks.

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:54.027
Much like a cat would play
with mice before they kill it.

01:24:55.128 --> 01:24:57.931
But that's just a weird game.

01:24:59.766 --> 01:25:02.168
We've known who you two
were ever since we met you

01:25:02.168 --> 01:25:04.104
at the bar yesterday.

01:25:04.104 --> 01:25:06.039
Doing what you're doing.

01:25:06.039 --> 01:25:09.042
We were both you, only we
were doing it long before

01:25:09.042 --> 01:25:10.877
you two were ever born.

01:25:10.877 --> 01:25:14.614
Now the university knows
that we know the rules

01:25:16.316 --> 01:25:18.284
and that's one of the reasons
we've been able to avoid

01:25:18.284 --> 01:25:20.787
their cross hairs
for over 20 years.

01:25:23.656 --> 01:25:26.726
And they'd know that
one of these rules

01:25:26.726 --> 01:25:28.261
say you'd never send a teacher

01:25:28.261 --> 01:25:29.762
because teachers,
they work alone.

01:25:31.264 --> 01:25:33.133
But I think they did
that intentionally,

01:25:33.133 --> 01:25:34.801
that was the reason, because
they thought if they sent

01:25:34.801 --> 01:25:37.770
you both you may
get close enough

01:25:39.205 --> 01:25:41.441
and that you can clean
their palate of us.

01:25:42.509 --> 01:25:43.343
Forever.

01:25:46.312 --> 01:25:48.148
Now there also may
be one other reason

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:50.383
they sent you both, I think.

01:25:50.383 --> 01:25:55.155
Because they knew that one
of you would do anything,

01:25:55.155 --> 01:25:57.290
and I mean anything to
get close enough to us

01:25:57.290 --> 01:25:58.825
to put a bullet in our heads.

01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:06.166
Did you know there's only
one time since we fled

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:08.134
the university that
we have any problems

01:26:08.134 --> 01:26:10.970
in this long, long,
strange trip we've had?

01:26:10.970 --> 01:26:13.673
April 26th, 1994.

01:26:13.673 --> 01:26:15.175
I'm good with dates, aren't I?

01:26:17.844 --> 01:26:20.213
I think you know that
date, don't you, darling?

01:26:22.982 --> 01:26:24.651
They found us in Europe.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:28.488
Man, you have his eyes.

01:26:30.823 --> 01:26:32.492
And that smile
when it comes out.

01:26:36.196 --> 01:26:40.033
And if he was my
daddy, I understand,

01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:41.734
because I would
want that revenge.

01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:48.975
But I love my wife, so I cannot
give you the satisfaction

01:26:51.010 --> 01:26:52.679
that you desire.

01:26:52.679 --> 01:26:54.747
I never even got to
say goodbye to him.

01:26:56.716 --> 01:26:58.384
He was a good man.

01:26:58.384 --> 01:26:59.452
He truly was.

01:27:00.853 --> 01:27:02.021
But he came to kill us.

01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:05.692
And this is the life we chose.

01:27:31.751 --> 01:27:34.420
I guess you've been out of
the game for too long now.

01:27:36.322 --> 01:27:38.091
You've gone soft
in your old age.

01:27:39.592 --> 01:27:40.760
You've lost your edge.

01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:44.631
Missed things that would've
got you killed years ago

01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:46.399
if you had then.

01:27:46.399 --> 01:27:49.936
Like my bride here emptying
out all the bullets

01:27:49.936 --> 01:27:51.771
from your only gun on board.

01:27:52.739 --> 01:27:53.906
I pity you, really.

01:27:55.508 --> 01:27:57.310
It amazes me that you've
been able to evade

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:59.078
the university as
long as you have.

01:28:00.513 --> 01:28:02.248
I mean, hell, you're
practically the reason

01:28:02.248 --> 01:28:04.484
for the no romantic
relationships on campus policy

01:28:04.484 --> 01:28:08.054
and yet here you sit helpless.

01:28:09.989 --> 01:28:12.692
The ones who got away.

01:28:12.692 --> 01:28:15.061
The runaways who
could never be found.

01:28:15.061 --> 01:28:17.096
You were once two of the best

01:28:17.096 --> 01:28:20.099
and now it seems as
though you've forgotten

01:28:20.099 --> 01:28:21.334
who you once were.

01:28:22.769 --> 01:28:26.472
No, you don't forget.

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.942
You don't forget
what we've done.

01:28:32.912 --> 01:28:36.783
Growing old does
not make you soft.

01:28:38.918 --> 01:28:41.154
I assure you I
haven't lost my edge.

01:28:42.955 --> 01:28:46.726
It's just that I got
tired of sharpening it.

01:28:48.494 --> 01:28:52.465
The fact that it is so dull
has put you in a position

01:28:52.465 --> 01:28:54.967
where not only can
you not protect her,

01:28:54.967 --> 01:28:56.869
but you can't protect yourself.

01:28:57.870 --> 01:28:58.938
We had a good life.

01:29:02.008 --> 01:29:02.842
More than most.

01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:08.848
And now we take the adventure
we never had together.

01:30:43.209 --> 01:30:45.044
I've always loved
the way you smell.

01:30:51.150 --> 01:30:52.285
You killed all of them?

01:30:54.821 --> 01:30:57.056
Are you
surprised, honey?

01:30:57.056 --> 01:30:57.857
No.

01:30:59.759 --> 01:31:00.593
Not really.

01:31:04.263 --> 01:31:05.932
They were our friends though.

01:31:10.136 --> 01:31:11.804
They
were your friends.

01:31:16.976 --> 01:31:18.478
I spoke to the Dean tonight.

01:31:19.946 --> 01:31:21.647
I convinced him you
weren't a flight risk

01:31:21.647 --> 01:31:24.884
and that you'd just
gotten cold feet.

01:31:27.186 --> 01:31:28.087
Oh, dear.

01:31:29.522 --> 01:31:31.357
It's gonna be kind
of hard to prove

01:31:31.357 --> 01:31:33.192
that now that you've killed
half our wedding party.

01:31:33.192 --> 01:31:35.661
I don't need to prove
anything to anybody anymore.

01:31:37.563 --> 01:31:40.666
Like I said, I want out.

01:31:41.734 --> 01:31:43.035
Well there's no way out.

01:31:44.537 --> 01:31:47.206
I think that old couple
has proven that enough.

01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:53.713
They'll find you no
matter how long it takes.

01:31:53.713 --> 01:31:56.215
That old couple still
had plenty of time together

01:31:56.215 --> 01:31:57.149
away from them.

01:31:59.185 --> 01:32:01.387
They had a good life.

01:32:01.387 --> 01:32:03.055
What?

01:32:03.055 --> 01:32:04.857
Out on a boat
practically by themselves

01:32:04.857 --> 01:32:09.729
for 20 something years
doing absolutely jack shit?

01:32:09.729 --> 01:32:13.032
That's not a life,
that's merely existence.

01:32:13.032 --> 01:32:15.501
We should have
never killed that couple.

01:32:15.501 --> 01:32:20.306
We did them a favor and
put them out of their misery.

01:32:21.774 --> 01:32:23.843
The old man killed your
father for Christ sake.

01:32:23.843 --> 01:32:26.078
Because my father
was one of them.

01:32:26.078 --> 01:32:27.146
One of us.

01:32:28.581 --> 01:32:30.416
He did what he had to
do for him and his wife

01:32:30.416 --> 01:32:31.918
to be together.

01:32:31.918 --> 01:32:35.555
Now the university
gave us their blessing.

01:32:39.358 --> 01:32:42.328
They didn't know so I didn't
think they would but they did.

01:32:48.901 --> 01:32:51.804
We could have a
good life together.

01:32:53.339 --> 01:32:55.374
The only reason they
gave us their blessing

01:32:55.374 --> 01:32:57.443
is because of what we
did to that couple.

01:32:59.779 --> 01:33:02.214
As long as we were still playing
by the rest of their rules

01:33:02.214 --> 01:33:04.450
we were worth more
alive to them than dead.

01:33:04.450 --> 01:33:08.621
Sure we came clean and
told them about us,

01:33:08.621 --> 01:33:09.922
so they trusted us,

01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:12.925
but really it was
just another way

01:33:12.925 --> 01:33:13.960
for them to still
try and control us.

01:33:15.761 --> 01:33:17.797
That's why they allowed
us to go through with it.

01:33:17.797 --> 01:33:19.532
But they allowed it.

01:33:20.733 --> 01:33:21.901
The university.

01:33:23.803 --> 01:33:26.138
To some they cut checks,

01:33:26.138 --> 01:33:29.842
to you they're like
a goddamn religion.

01:33:30.977 --> 01:33:32.778
Don't you get it?

01:33:32.778 --> 01:33:34.780
We shouldn't have had
to ask permission.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:38.818
Yeah, well, we all knew
the rules when we enrolled.

01:33:40.119 --> 01:33:41.020
All of us did.

01:33:42.755 --> 01:33:46.626
Well, like I
said, people change.

01:33:49.562 --> 01:33:50.596
Well what about us?

01:33:51.597 --> 01:33:52.932
Hmm?

01:33:52.932 --> 01:33:54.033
Did that change too?

01:33:58.571 --> 01:34:00.339
You look like you
could use a drink.

01:34:02.642 --> 01:34:04.276
Come on.

01:34:04.276 --> 01:34:06.012
Don't treat me like a stranger.

01:34:06.012 --> 01:34:08.347
After all you are the
one who left me standing

01:34:08.347 --> 01:34:09.415
at the altar tonight.

01:34:10.249 --> 01:34:11.050
Remember?

01:34:15.788 --> 01:34:19.992
Sure, I could
always use a drink.

01:35:02.368 --> 01:35:04.370
May I have this dance?

01:35:05.838 --> 01:35:06.906
Last dance.

01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.852

01:35:20.953 --> 01:35:25.891

♪ Doo, ah, you said you

01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:28.287
Why'd you do it?

01:36:29.755 --> 01:36:31.490
Why did you leave
them all there?

01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:33.993
All alone with no explanation.

01:36:35.961 --> 01:36:39.832
If I could run from
you easily, I would've
done it sooner.

01:36:39.832 --> 01:36:42.001
But you're my partner.

01:36:42.001 --> 01:36:45.571
And a partner's not supposed
to run from their partner.

01:36:45.571 --> 01:36:48.641
I guess I'm
not a good person.

01:36:48.641 --> 01:36:50.476
Most of the people
that you've killed

01:36:52.211 --> 01:36:54.180
weren't very good for
themselves or anyone else.

01:36:55.948 --> 01:36:59.485
See even God doesn't
judge, so why should we?

01:37:03.155 --> 01:37:05.457
I was sitting
in church tonight,

01:37:06.759 --> 01:37:09.628
alone in my
beautiful white dress

01:37:11.363 --> 01:37:15.467
and I saw this mother with
her baby and a little baby boy

01:37:17.236 --> 01:37:21.707
and I knew right then and
there that if I married you,

01:37:23.442 --> 01:37:24.710
I could never have that.

01:37:26.545 --> 01:37:27.680
I do love you.

01:37:29.448 --> 01:37:33.686
But deep down, I know I
couldn't go through with it.

01:37:36.488 --> 01:37:39.225
I went to the Board, I
was prepared to go down

01:37:39.225 --> 01:37:43.362
in a hail of bullets
if that's what it took.

01:37:43.362 --> 01:37:44.563
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:50.336
Maybe that's what
should have happened then.

01:37:58.277 --> 01:38:01.480
Even when so many
things were right?

01:38:02.882 --> 01:38:04.683
You're the one who
wanted a big wedding.

01:38:10.890 --> 01:38:14.126
If I had come to you
first, would you have left?

01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:17.429
They gave us
everything we wanted.

01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:20.065
There was no reason to run.

01:38:23.102 --> 01:38:25.938
So you're prepared
to die with me,

01:38:27.373 --> 01:38:29.208
but you would've never
left them for me?

01:38:30.209 --> 01:38:31.043
Huh?

01:38:34.313 --> 01:38:38.884
Even if I did, they
would've killed us both.

01:38:38.884 --> 01:38:40.319
I wouldn't want that for you.

01:38:41.553 --> 01:38:43.222
I wouldn't want that for us.

01:38:44.723 --> 01:38:46.258
There is no us.

01:38:48.127 --> 01:38:49.161
Not anymore.

01:38:53.165 --> 01:38:54.767
Well if you're so
through with everything,

01:38:54.767 --> 01:38:57.436
why'd you even come
here in first place?

01:38:57.436 --> 01:38:59.538
Why didn't you just keep running

01:38:59.538 --> 01:39:01.073
if that's what
you really wanted?

01:39:01.073 --> 01:39:05.177
Because hell hath no
fury like a man scorned.

01:39:06.745 --> 01:39:08.447
You're a jilted lover now, babe.

01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:12.084
And once I'm running,

01:39:12.084 --> 01:39:13.652
the teacher that's
gonna come after me,

01:39:13.652 --> 01:39:17.790
the strongest and
the hardest is you

01:39:19.191 --> 01:39:21.427
and I want to drab,
routine kind of a life.

01:39:23.262 --> 01:39:26.966
And I'm willing to die to
try and make that happen.

01:39:35.641 --> 01:39:37.142
Aint love grand?

01:39:43.282 --> 01:39:46.051
I came to say goodbye.

01:39:56.929 --> 01:39:57.930
All right.

01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:02.001
I do love you.

01:40:06.138 --> 01:40:07.306
I always will.

01:40:10.476 --> 01:40:13.145
But one of us has
to die tonight.

01:40:13.145 --> 01:40:13.979
Mm.

01:40:15.547 --> 01:40:19.952
Well I'm not gonna wait
around to play defense.

01:40:19.952 --> 01:40:24.957
This is offense.

01:41:01.927 --> 01:41:04.563

I don't know.

I think maybe you
should hold onto it.

01:43:40.152 --> 01:43:41.253
I'm tired of hiding.

01:43:45.857 --> 01:43:47.359

01:43:49.461 --> 01:43:51.296

that other couple.

I dunno, maybe...

01:43:55.033 --> 01:43:56.568
Maybe we'll go to the
university, we'll come clean,

01:43:56.568 --> 01:43:58.237
let the chips fall
where they fall.

01:43:58.237 --> 01:43:59.371
It's worth the risk.

01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:03.175
You are worth the risk.

01:44:12.017 --> 01:44:13.485
