13:44.158 --> 13:46.744
I feel like getting drunk tonight.
How about you?

13:46.827 --> 13:49.079
When I was a nurse in Vietnam,

13:49.163 --> 13:53.250
I was stuck out in the middle of the jungle
with the real Rambo.

13:54.168 --> 13:55.753
He had the hots for me.

13:55.836 --> 13:58.088
I mean, he was drivin' me crazy.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.256
Hmm.

13:59.340 --> 14:03.135
Course, it'd be difficult for anybody
not to fall in love with you in that humidity.

14:03.219 --> 14:06.430
And then I saved his life about 50 times.

14:06.514 --> 14:09.183
I bet you've seen me here before.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.978
[roars, laughs]

14:13.062 --> 14:15.064
I'm the dancing bear.

14:15.147 --> 14:16.607
- Hi, Louis.
- Hey.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.443
- You gonna dance in the show on Friday?
- Yeah, yeah.

14:19.527 --> 14:21.820
- But -
- Excuse us.

14:21.904 --> 14:24.240
I'm still having trouble with the ladies.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.283
Buddy, I tell ya,

14:26.367 --> 14:30.329
in fact, there are a half million
more single guys than there are gals,

14:30.412 --> 14:32.039
and the competition is tough.

14:32.122 --> 14:36.001
[Crazy Cajun] We're gonna have
a good time, do it to it and...

14:36.085 --> 14:40.381
Most of them just want to swing
or aren't really serious.

14:43.551 --> 14:46.720
- [speakers: pop music ends]
- Some of these gals are as bad as the guys.

14:46.804 --> 14:49.473
[Crazy Cajun]
How you like them bananas there, people?

14:49.557 --> 14:52.643
- That's mine there.
- [Louis] I'll take the red one.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.313
We got us a song coming up
called "Wild, Wild Life."

14:56.397 --> 14:59.191
I tell you, we want you
to lip-sing along with us.

14:59.275 --> 15:02.194
But wait a minute. Don't do it now.
Let me tell ya about my set, you see.

15:02.278 --> 15:03.737
[woman]
Did you see Jason's here tonight?

15:03.821 --> 15:06.490
- Hey, Ramon. How are you?
- How's it going?

15:06.574 --> 15:08.033
- Good to see you.
- Partying?

15:08.117 --> 15:11.078
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Want me to read your tones, man?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.621
Yeah. Go ahead.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.667
Relax.

15:16.750 --> 15:20.129

15:20.212 --> 15:22.923
Hey, don't worry about it.
You're going to be all right.

15:23.007 --> 15:26.552
You're gonna be all right.
Take it easy. See you later, man.

15:27.136 --> 15:32.224
Now, I guaran-damn-tee you,
you know, traveling is my life.

15:32.308 --> 15:34.768

Mm-hmm.

Well, he pretty much single-handedly
brought Varicorp to Virgil.

- [audience applauding]
- First, take the 285 -

25:39.080 --> 25:42.167

if it wasn't for him.

I’m having dinner with them later.

haven't spoken to one another in years.

25:53.845 --> 25:55.513
At least, not directly.

25:56.681 --> 25:58.308
Do you believe it?

25:59.226 --> 26:01.478
Okay.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.688
What time is it?

26:03.772 --> 26:08.235
If everyone notices,
maybe it's too much.

26:08.318 --> 26:09.986
But where would we be?

26:11.154 --> 26:14.324
29.95 is a pretty good price.

26:14.407 --> 26:17.369
With six outfits
and as many combinations,

26:17.452 --> 26:20.121
well, the possibilities are endless.

26:20.205 --> 26:22.415
Shopping is a feeling.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.001
Sometimes I get a wobbly feeling.

26:25.085 --> 26:26.962
I have a commercial feeling.

26:27.045 --> 26:30.006
Be sexy in business.

26:30.090 --> 26:32.801
- Be successful at night.

I've felt this way before.

[woman] I know. Me neither.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.746

30:29.829 --> 30:31.247
[man] Yeah, l-l guess.

30:31.331 --> 30:35.919
But people at work
must think I’m going nuts though.

30:36.961 --> 30:40.298
[woman] Well, if this is being nuts,
then I don't ever want to be sane.

Yeah, I’m in the construction business.

31:12.914 --> 31:16.501

[laughs]

31:16.584 --> 31:19.045
Bought me a condo last week.

31:19.128 --> 31:21.297
Shoot, real close to here,
as a matter of fact.

31:21.381 --> 31:24.801
And next week I just think
I might buy me another house.

31:24.884 --> 31:28.137
Darlin', I’ll tell you what now,
I just have a feel for it.

31:28.221 --> 31:30.098
You know what I mean? [laughs]

31:30.181 --> 31:32.684
Course, being overly psychic
sure doesn't hurt anything.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.143
It's paid off for me.

31:34.852 --> 31:37.063
Listen, Mr. Frye, I’ll tell you som-

31:37.146 --> 31:39.023
- Fyne. Louis.
- Fyne, uh -

31:39.107 --> 31:41.442
Louis darlin', listen,
I’ll tell you something

31:41.526 --> 31:44.988
if you promise not to tell
another living soul.

31:45.071 --> 31:47.490
Now, I’d never tell this to anybody else,

31:47.574 --> 31:51.286
but I believe
that part of my extra-psychic ability

31:51.369 --> 31:54.455
is connected up with the fact
that I was born with a tail.

31:55.290 --> 31:58.167
A little ol' bitty, hairy thing
about that long.

31:58.251 --> 32:01.421
Had it surgically removed
when I was just five years old.

32:02.755 --> 32:06.426
My mama kept it in a fruit jar
up in the medicine cabinet,

32:06.509 --> 32:09.470
right between the 4 Way Cold Tablets
and the monkey blood.

32:09.554 --> 32:11.806
[laughs]
I’d get up every morning.

32:11.889 --> 32:14.809
First thing, I’d go in there
in the bathroom, brush my teeth,

32:14.892 --> 32:17.270
and stare at my own tail
at the same time.

32:18.104 --> 32:21.774
Now, something like that
can give you power, and that's the truth.

32:21.858 --> 32:23.943
Then Mama got a wild hair
one Sunday

32:24.027 --> 32:26.988
and she decided to go make
a lot of money off it, you know.

32:27.071 --> 32:28.990
Took it out to a big ol' swap meet

32:29.073 --> 32:31.743
and sold it to Lyndon Johnson's
top Secret Service agent.

32:31.826 --> 32:34.329
And he told a good,
personal friend of mine

32:34.412 --> 32:38.166
that he was gonna sell it for even more
money to the Smithsonian Institute.

32:38.958 --> 32:41.961
Shoot, he might as well!
It wouldn't do him any good.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.130
It wasn't his tail.
[laughing]

32:44.964 --> 32:49.135
Gee, I’ll tell you, I could write a book.
That thing'd be a best seller.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.220
You know, that's funny.
You mentioned writing. I’m...

32:52.347 --> 32:53.973
kind of a writer myself.

32:54.057 --> 32:55.600
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.269
I wrote me a little song
I wanna do at the show Friday.

32:58.353 --> 33:01.606
- That's great!
- Yeah, I hope - hope it turns out all right.

33:01.689 --> 33:03.858
- I’m a little nervous.
- Oh, don't be nervous.

33:03.941 --> 33:05.485
Songs are easy.

33:05.568 --> 33:08.946
I wrote "Billie Jean"
and half of Elvis's songs.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.823
- Elvis?
- Hell, yes.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.950
They pay me and I keep quiet.

33:13.034 --> 33:15.453
Somebody's gotta do it.

33:16.371 --> 33:19.332
Excuse me just a minute, pumpkin.
I’ll be right back. Okay?

33:19.415 --> 33:20.792
Oh, sure, sure.

33:20.875 --> 33:22.877
I’ll be right here.

[singing opera in Italian]

and give our thanks? Hmm?

34:21.310 --> 34:22.520
Amen.

34:33.030 --> 34:37.493

to pass this down to our guest?

34:38.745 --> 34:41.289
This looks great, Mrs. Culver.

- Dad, will you pass this down?
- Oh. Yes.

34:44.083 --> 34:47.003

34:47.085 --> 34:48.838
- [Earl clears throat]
- Thank you.

Linda, would you ask your mother to
pass the mustard to our guest, please.

34:55.553 --> 34:57.138
Um, Mom, Dad wants the mustard.

34:57.221 --> 34:58.473
Oh.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.354
- [Kay] Dear?
- [Earl] Mmm. Thank you.

35:06.856 --> 35:09.817
- Whoops.
- Look out for your water now.

35:09.901 --> 35:12.361
Here, you take this,
pass it down to our guest.

35:12.445 --> 35:15.698
And let me grab one of these.
Oh, they're colorful. What are they, fish?

35:15.782 --> 35:18.785
Linda, would you ask your mom
how the fashion show went today. Okay?

35:18.868 --> 35:21.913
Sure, Dad.
Mom, how'd it go today?

35:21.996 --> 35:25.458
Oh, Linda.
You tell him it was just wonderful.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.795
Although one woman did have an accident,
but it wasn't anything serious.

35:28.878 --> 35:32.089
You should've been there.
You would've been real proud of me.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.926
She said it went great, Dad.

35:35.009 --> 35:36.928
- You should have been there.
- Well, maybe next time.

35:37.011 --> 35:39.931
I was there. I liked it.

35:40.014 --> 35:42.099
I’d never seen anything like that, Mrs. Culver.

35:43.226 --> 35:45.728
I’d never been to one of those things before.

35:45.812 --> 35:47.522
Do you do that every year?

35:47.605 --> 35:50.024
Oh, no.
This is just for the sesquicentennial.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.068
Oh, yeah?
You guys gonna be in the parade?

35:52.151 --> 35:56.113
Yeah! And Anderson Auto is lending us
a red convertible for it too.

35:56.197 --> 35:58.241
- Hmm.
- [Earl] Mmm, that's right.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.868
You know, Larry here
may have a future at Varicorp.

36:00.952 --> 36:04.247
With his young discipline and systems
consciousness, he could go a long way.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.958
And Varicorp is growing
like there's no tomorrow.

36:07.041 --> 36:09.961

36:29.230 --> 36:31.566

36:42.910 --> 36:45.037
[imitating truck engine]

36:46.372 --> 36:51.085
Ah, now, most middle-class people have worked
for large corporations like Varicorp.

36:52.211 --> 36:54.255
Or for the government itself.

36:54.338 --> 36:57.884
But now all that's started to change.

36:57.967 --> 37:02.638
Scientists and engineers are moving off
from those large corporations like Varicorp

37:02.722 --> 37:05.099
and they're beginning to start
their own companies,

37:05.182 --> 37:07.476

For the time being
it's created confusion and chaos.

the difference between working...

Let's see.

01:08:03.998 --> 01:08:07.793
Take, uh, 157 to 287,

01:08:07.877 --> 01:08:10.796
and then a left at the Kmart,

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:14.091
and then go two miles.

01:08:17.178 --> 01:08:19.764
I’m really getting used to these outfits.

01:08:19.846 --> 01:08:23.475
They sell a lot of 'em,
but I don't see anybody else wearing them.

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.604
[Earl] Hi out there.
Good evening and welcome.

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:12.817
Welcome to our talent show
under the stars.

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:15.611
Before we begin,
I want to just tell you a little story

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:19.698
that I heard about Texas recently
in a local tavern.

01:09:19.782 --> 01:09:22.243
Seems as though God
was working around the earth here,

01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:25.162
trying to make it beautiful,
just like the rest of the world.

01:09:25.246 --> 01:09:27.497
He had to knock off
because it was nighttime.

01:09:27.581 --> 01:09:31.210
He said, "I’ll come back tomorrow and make it
just as pretty as the rest of the world,

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.046
with lakes and streams
and mountains and trees."

01:09:34.129 --> 01:09:36.674
Then he got back the next day
and he saw that the ground

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.343
had completely hardened like concrete.

01:09:39.426 --> 01:09:42.763
And he didn't want to begin
all over again, no.

01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:45.432
In his infinite wisdom, he had an idea.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.685
He said, "I know what I'll do.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:51.229
I’ll make some people
that like it this way."

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.109
[laughing]

01:09:55.192 --> 01:09:57.903
I want you to welcome this first act here.

01:09:57.987 --> 01:10:01.407
They'll tell you more about Texas
in five seconds than you'd ever want to know.

01:10:01.490 --> 01:10:03.492
I want you to welcome, please,

01:10:03.576 --> 01:10:08.163

Shoot, they been begging me
to be the lead singer for this band,

but my managers won't let me do anything,
you know, local or anything amateur.

[cheering continues]

01:22:59.392 --> 01:23:00.810
Hello?

01:23:07.442 --> 01:23:08.943
Yes.

01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.202
[Louis] This place is a dream palace.

01:23:17.285 --> 01:23:19.913
- Confidentially, he did ask me first.
- Did you see the catalog?

01:23:19.996 --> 01:23:22.207
- Oh, no, I didn't.
- Oh, it's gorgeous!

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:24.125
- You have to look at it.
- Oh. Well, you're gorgeous.

01:23:24.209 --> 01:23:26.461
You saw this, didn't you? Cute, ain't it?

01:23:27.921 --> 01:23:30.298
I think we chose right.
Do you like the colors?

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:33.259
- Oh, well, I love turquoise.
- [Louis] <i>I think you can see Varicorp from here.</i>

01:23:33.343 --> 01:23:35.428
Hey, Louis.
Where you going on your honeymoon?

01:23:35.512 --> 01:23:38.932
The Bear is staying with me.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.770
[The Lying Woman] I think he's from Pluto.
Or he might be from Venus.

01:23:43.853 --> 01:23:46.064
You know, he is real good-looking.

01:23:48.525 --> 01:23:50.318
This is not a rental car.

01:23:50.402 --> 01:23:52.570
This is privately owned.

01:23:54.989 --> 01:23:58.535
Well, I really enjoy forgetting.

01:24:00.745 --> 01:24:04.874
When I first come to a place,
I notice all the little details.

01:24:04.958 --> 01:24:08.586
I notice the way the sky looks,
the color of white paper,

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:11.589
the way people walk, doorknobs.

01:24:11.673 --> 01:24:13.466
Everything.

01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:17.095
Then I get used to the place
and I don't notice those things anymore.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.056
So only by forgetting

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:22.726
can I see the place again as it really is.
