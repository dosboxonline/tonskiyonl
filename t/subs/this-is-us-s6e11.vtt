Okay, well,
it's gonna be more expensive

00:07.257 --> 00:08.425
if there's water damage or--

Kate, I'll fix it.

fill Sheila's job yet?

No, but we're looking

I'd like to be considered.

-Two weeks ago, you were

-Two weeks ago, I was still

01:25.251 --> 01:27.003
in shock from your rather huge,

01:27.087 --> 01:29.964
-rather humiliating
unilateral decision.
-"Decision"?

01:30.048 --> 01:31.591

ultimatum. You said I had to...

how to light

about the egg-niter?

06:31.057 --> 06:33.018
Why? What did you hear?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.978
I mean, I didn't hear anything
specific; it's just...

06:35.061 --> 06:36.896
I tried, you know,
but your walls are really thick.

06:36.980 --> 06:38.815
Well, Toby left one
of Jack's safety gates open,

06:38.898 --> 06:40.650
and I told him that he has
to listen for the click.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.485
Got to listen for the click.
If you don't hear the click--

06:42.569 --> 06:44.404
If you don't hear the click,
then it's not locked, right.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.989
So then he said
I was helicopter-parenting

06:46.072 --> 06:47.449
his parenting...

06:47.532 --> 06:49.534
I don't know, maybe I am,
but, like, he's never here.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.245
And so, you know,
that broken record

06:52.328 --> 06:54.956

about our fight?

08:09.656 --> 08:11.991

08:12.075 --> 08:13.535
Okay.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.328
Wait, Toby, come on,
I-I thought that

08:15.412 --> 08:17.539
we were just gonna try
to have, like, one nice day.

08:17.622 --> 08:20.750
I'm just going to smoke
Miguel's meat.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.211
That came out weird, but yeah.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.588
-JACK: Hey, Mama.
-(door opens and closes)

08:25.672 --> 08:27.382
Walk to the park.

08:27.465 --> 08:28.800
You know what, Jackie, we can't.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.386
But it's Saturday.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.971
-I know, I know.
-(doorbell rings)

08:33.054 --> 08:34.681
Open the door with you, Mama?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.766
Okay.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.810
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

08:38.893 --> 08:42.564
KATE:
Okay, unlock it.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.108
Your hand.
There we go. Go for it.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.609
-JACK: Opened that door.
-KATE: Good job.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.778
-RANDALL: Oh, there's my nephew!
-BETH: Hey!

08:48.862 --> 08:51.239
-Hi.
-KATE: Hi. Hi.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.700
I still can't believe you came
all this way for a barbecue.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.994
-Me, neither.
-RANDALL: For Mom and Miguel's

08:56.077 --> 08:57.704
tenth anniversary party,
come on!

08:57.787 --> 08:59.497
-We wouldn't miss it.
-BETH: Our hormonal girls,

08:59.581 --> 09:01.499
on the other hand, opted
to stay at home with my mom

09:01.583 --> 09:03.501
and get their knuckles slapped.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.420
Well, I'm really glad
that you're here.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.422
RANDALL:
Aw, glad to be here.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.508
Okay, we're hugging again.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.635
That's cool. It's cool.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.763
We're doing a long one. Yeah.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.182
Oh, with a little bit
of rocking.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.392
-Yeah.
-Jack?

09:19.476 --> 09:22.228
Hey, let's go
to the kitchen, bud.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.273
-Let's, uh, let this happen.
-RANDALL: Okay.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.400
Hey, what's going on?

09:27.484 --> 09:29.152
I can't handle it, Randall.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.154
I can't.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.573
Every day, I wake up
and I think, "Okay,

09:33.656 --> 09:35.909
today's the day that
Toby and I aren't gonna fight."

09:35.992 --> 09:38.328
And then there's
trip wires everywhere.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.331
(exhales) God, and Kevin,
he's driving him crazy.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.833
Honestly, I think that Toby
might kill him,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.085
and I don't want him
to kill him.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.337
-Tell me what to do.
-Take Kevin out of here.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.422
Go pick up the twins early
from Madison's or something.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.174
Just take a long time, please.

09:51.257 --> 09:52.759
I got you. Hey.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.636
You guys are gonna make it
through this.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.638
You hear me?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.139
You want me to get Beth
out of here, too?

09:58.223 --> 09:59.849
What? No.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.352
She's, like, the least stressful
person in this whole family. No.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.230
-Try not to create
a lot of stress.
-BETH: Kate?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.524
-Yeah?
-Little issue in here.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.985
Oopsie.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.487
KATE:
Great.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.322
This feels about right.

10:14.406 --> 10:15.740
(sighs)

10:21.413 --> 10:23.039
Oh, my God, this place, Jack.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.042
When the girl hung up my coat
back there, I almost cried.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.086
I mean, I can't tell you

10:28.169 --> 10:30.839
the last time someone actually
hung up my coat for me.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.258
-Wow, cheap date.
-I mean, this is

10:33.341 --> 10:35.635
my first night out
in almost six years.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.388
You are the greatest husband.
This is the greatest restaurant.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.432
-It's gonna be
the greatest night of my life.
-Okay.

10:40.515 --> 10:41.808
-No pressure.
-No pressure.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.268
-(Rebecca chuckles)
-Well, hello.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.437
-BOTH: Hi.
-Can I start you guys
with a drink?

10:45.520 --> 10:47.272
Uh, yes, please.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.191
Um, do you happen to serve
drinks with adorable names?

10:50.275 --> 10:54.154
-I thought I heard you serve
drinks with adorable names.
-Yes.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.573
Well, our signature drinks are:
Between the Sheets,

10:56.656 --> 10:58.366
Blue Lagoon, Dirty Banana,

10:58.450 --> 11:00.160
Fluffy Duck, Fuzzy Navel,

11:00.243 --> 11:02.078
-Jungle Bird--
-Yes.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.538
Yes?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.416
Yes to all of them, one by one.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.585
-Thank you.
-I'll have a beer.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.003
-You got it.
-Thank you.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.796
(sighs) Hi.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.882
I am carefree, childless

11:13.965 --> 11:15.925
-Rebecca Malone--
do you remember me?
-Yeah, faintly.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.927
I...

11:18.011 --> 11:21.097
am gonna rock
your world tonight, babe.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.641
I'm gonna get the check now.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.478
(both laugh)

11:26.561 --> 11:28.855
Mommy and Daddy usually
put us to sleep at 8:00,

11:28.938 --> 11:30.982
but now it's 8:34
because we were too excited

11:31.066 --> 11:32.984
because tonight is
a special night

11:33.068 --> 11:34.277
because we all get to sleep
together.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.695
All right, Chatty Cathy.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.155
Time to find your off switch.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.157
I mean, geez.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.077
He-Man, G.I. Joe,
you ready for lights-out?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.204
No! I'm not tired!
I'm not going to sleep!

11:44.287 --> 11:45.955
Come on, Kevin, it's bedtime.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.458
No. I don't like you.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.085
JOANIE:
Well, I don't care. Bedtime.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.544
I said no.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.631
I didn't know things
had gotten so bad

11:54.714 --> 11:56.341
-between Kate and Toby.
-Yeah, man.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.927
It's not very good.

11:59.010 --> 12:01.012
(doorbell rings)

12:02.597 --> 12:05.058
-What are we doing?
-Oh, yeah, no, I don't use
my house key here anymore.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.810
Out of respect.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.061
For the mother of my children.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.771
-Got ya.
-Yeah.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.147
Well, Kate stuff aside,

12:11.231 --> 12:12.941
you seem to be doing
pretty well, Kev.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.192
Thanks, yeah.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.528
Putting down some roots,
you know, solid base.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.279
-I'm at peace
with my life, you know?
-Yeah.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.198
Plus my new place
has those fancy toilets.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.117
You know, the ones that spray,
so you barely have to wipe?

12:22.200 --> 12:23.993
-Got one of 'em.
-I know you do.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.245
-Hey!
-Hi.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.413
-How are you?
-Come in.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.164
-Thank you.
-RANDALL: Madison!

12:28.248 --> 12:30.083
MADISON:
Randall!

12:30.166 --> 12:31.626
(twins laughing)

12:31.710 --> 12:33.336
Oh, my goodness, look at these

12:33.420 --> 12:35.380
beautiful babies.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.923
Beautiful, right?
Hey, you taking them out?

12:37.007 --> 12:38.717
Yeah, we are off to music class.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.051
You are two hours early, dude.

12:40.135 --> 12:41.511
KEVIN:
I... Yeah, I know, I know.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.097
Kate kicked me out. She thought
Toby was gonna murder me.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.473
How'd you know
she was worried about that?

12:45.557 --> 12:48.435
We're twins.
It's that ESP thing.

12:48.518 --> 12:49.894
Plus I-I heard her tell you.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.688
-That sounds right, yeah.
-Yep.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.523
Well, I can drop them off
at the party later.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.025
Yeah? That sounds good. Okay.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.609
Hey, I saw Elijah's car.

12:56.693 --> 12:58.611
You want to meet Elijah?
It's Madison's new beau.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.699
Our dynamic is super weird,
and it's wildly uncomfortable.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.326
-It's true.
-Can't wait.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.745
MADISON:
Well, I'm sorry
I have to miss that.

13:06.828 --> 13:07.954
RANDALL:
Well, let me help you

13:08.038 --> 13:09.748
-with this monster stroller.
-Thank you.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.958
-And Elijah's where?
-Uh, in my bedroom.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.335
Okay, all right.
Be good to your mom.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.086
-Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy."
-Okay, bye!

13:15.170 --> 13:17.714
-RANDALL: My goodness,
these kids are growing!
-MADISON: I know.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.264
Hey, man, what are you doing?

13:26.348 --> 13:27.932
Hi there.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.894
-Yeah, so I know
what this looks like.
-Well... (stammers)

13:30.977 --> 13:32.771
...it looks like you're
stealing Madison's jewelry.

13:32.854 --> 13:35.690
Yeah, yeah, I know, but it's
not that at all, I swear.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.735
-So how are you?
-Me?

13:38.818 --> 13:40.362
I'm good, I'm good.
What-what...?

13:40.445 --> 13:43.323
What's under your shirt?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.408
Uh...

13:47.952 --> 13:49.621
Okay, look, it's...

13:49.704 --> 13:52.957
Wow, I look like a real pervy
thief, don't I? But I'm not.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.251
It's a, um...

13:55.335 --> 13:57.045
ring sizer.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.007
Oh.

14:01.091 --> 14:03.968
Oh, oh, yeah, you're, you're,
you're gonna, uh...

14:04.052 --> 14:06.471
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.972
-KATE: This isn't
happening right now.
-TOBY: Okay.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.391
Can you just move that towel
so I can get up there?

14:09.474 --> 14:12.018
-Here's some towels.
-No, not the good towels.

14:12.102 --> 14:14.312
Well, yeah,
I can wash them afterwards.

14:14.396 --> 14:16.439
-Hey, Kate, I'm gonna
turn off this stove, okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.316
Hey, uh, Toby, I don't think
it's a good idea

14:18.400 --> 14:20.568
to open that up right now.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.946
-KATE: Stay right here.
-Yeah, we need to turn the
water off to the house first.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.864
-Yeah.
-Wait, so we're not
gonna have water?

14:24.948 --> 14:26.616
Toby, I begged you to call
the plumber about this.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.535
We couldn't afford it
then, okay?

14:28.618 --> 14:30.870
Okay, so now we have
a more expensive problem.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.372
TOBY:
It's good thing I have
such a high-paying

14:32.455 --> 14:33.456
job that you resent so much.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.916
You know what, Miguel?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.043
Can you please help my wife
with this since she thinks

14:37.127 --> 14:39.337
-I can't take care of it?
I'm gonna go check on the grill.
-Yeah, sure.

14:39.421 --> 14:42.132
REBECCA:
Hey, sweetheart, it's just,
it's a leak, it's okay.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.050
Toby, can you please
take Jack with you?

14:44.134 --> 14:45.510
It's a little slippery in here.

14:45.593 --> 14:47.053
And make sure that you close
the gate to the--

14:47.137 --> 14:49.014
I know, until it clicks!
I got it.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.933
Can I put shoes on him first,
please?

14:52.017 --> 14:53.810
At least let me do that.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.688
(Jack crying)

14:56.771 --> 14:58.398
Come on, sweetheart.

14:58.481 --> 15:00.692
Let's go put your shoes on.
Come on.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.280
(door slams, rattles)

15:10.618 --> 15:12.412
Here.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.372
Miguel made 'em.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.166
I don't know what's in this,

15:16.249 --> 15:18.793
-but it's getting the job done.
-Okay.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.379
(slurps)

15:21.463 --> 15:23.548
So, this is the famous

15:23.631 --> 15:25.759
Big Green Egg, huh?

15:25.842 --> 15:28.011
Did it come
with a big green ham? (chuckles)

15:28.094 --> 15:30.138
You know, like--
Because <i>Green Eggs and--</i> No?

15:30.221 --> 15:32.015
You're not in the mood?
I feel you.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.516
I liked-- I liked it. Sorry.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.685
Sor-- And sorry for the scene
in there.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.812
You know,
every time I walk into a room

15:37.896 --> 15:40.607
with Kate in it, I tell myself,
"Toby, be light.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.067
Be playful." And then I just--

15:42.150 --> 15:43.818
-I lose myself.
-Oh, please.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.070
I blame Kevin, okay?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.529
He came to live with us
for a year,

15:46.613 --> 15:47.655
and I nearly killed Randall.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.325
Kev can drive a person crazy.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.286
Hey, Toblerone.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.789
I know it's none of my business,
but, you know,

15:55.872 --> 15:58.083
uh, Randall and I did the
long-distance thing for a while,

15:58.166 --> 16:00.210
when he was campaigning
in Philly,

16:00.293 --> 16:01.503
and...

16:01.586 --> 16:03.254
it's a bitch.
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:03.338 --> 16:06.716
But, uh, we made it through.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.718
Yeah, I think the difference
is... (sighs)

16:08.802 --> 16:11.054
you moved for him, Beth.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.472
Well, I moved for myself.

16:12.555 --> 16:14.349
And for work.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.518
-And for...
-For your marriage.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.939
♪ ♪

16:23.316 --> 16:25.985
REBECCA:
Hey, Jack. Your shoes
are lined up so neatly.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.904
-Oh, yeah.
-(chuckles softly)

16:27.987 --> 16:30.115
-They are.
-Did your mommy do it?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.200
Yes. These ones,

16:32.283 --> 16:34.994
high-tops. Low-tops.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.622
Rubber boots.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.291
Dressy shoes.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.502
I hate dressy shoes.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.504
Yeah. I hate dressy shoes, too.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.506
They're very uncomfy.
(chuckles softly)

16:47.549 --> 16:49.801
So which ones should we wear
to the barbecue, you think?

16:49.884 --> 16:52.804
Should we wear the rubber boots?

16:52.887 --> 16:55.223
Oh, but they're for
muddy puddles.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.683
-Okay?
-Oh,

16:56.766 --> 16:58.685
rubber boots
are for muddy puddles.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.438
-Okay.
-Yeah. For the park.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.606
Grandma, are you sad?

17:04.733 --> 17:05.859
(clicks tongue)
Honey.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.028
You know what? I...
(sighs)

17:08.111 --> 17:10.447
I just-- I want to feel useful.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.158
And Grandma does not feel
very useful today.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.244
Oh, yeah.

17:16.327 --> 17:17.454
Is Jackie sad?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.039
Jackie's sad.

17:19.122 --> 17:21.374
Mommy and Daddy are mad a lot.

17:21.458 --> 17:23.460
Mommy and Daddy
are mad a lot?

17:23.543 --> 17:24.711
Yeah.

17:26.212 --> 17:29.549
Well, mommies and daddies
fight sometimes.

17:29.632 --> 17:32.135
But it's gonna be okay.

17:33.762 --> 17:35.764
Okay.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.641
These ones.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.227
-Low-tops.
-Low-tops.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.937
You got it.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.690
Let's put these on then.
Come on.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.615
-(slurping) Mmm!
-There you are. (chuckles)

17:53.698 --> 17:55.158
-Must be a good one. (chuckles)
-REBECCA: Hmm.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.409
-(waiter chuckles)
-(slurping continues)

17:56.493 --> 17:57.535
Mmm.

17:57.619 --> 17:58.703
Good to the last drop.

17:58.787 --> 17:59.746
(waiter chuckles)

17:59.829 --> 18:02.082
-Thank you! (chuckles)
-No problem.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.417
-Wow. Beautiful.
-Hey.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.087
Bec, may-maybe you should
slow down a little bit?

18:07.170 --> 18:08.838
I think maybe you should
slow down a little.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.008
(chuckles) I think maybe
that doesn't, uh, make any sense

18:12.092 --> 18:14.010
-because I'm still on
my first drink.
-Mmm.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.220
Mmm.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.972
To ten amazing years.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.391
Yes.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.393
-Mmm.
-Ten amazing years.

18:21.476 --> 18:24.062
Where do you think we're gonna
be ten years from now, babe?

18:24.145 --> 18:26.398
Probably still at this table,
waiting for our food.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.943
(laughing loudly)

18:31.486 --> 18:32.570
(chuckles)

18:32.654 --> 18:34.072
(laughing)

18:34.155 --> 18:35.782
(sighs)
Mmm.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.618
I know what I should do.

18:38.702 --> 18:39.619
Huh?

18:39.703 --> 18:42.247
I should cut my hair short,

18:42.330 --> 18:43.540
like Princess Diana.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.958
(laughs)

18:45.041 --> 18:48.211
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go get you
some bread.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.796
I don't want bread.

18:49.879 --> 18:50.922
-Mr. Pearson?
-Yeah.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.882
-Your babysitter.
-Oh.

18:54.009 --> 18:55.927
Joanie?

18:56.011 --> 18:58.513
It's crazy. It's just--
The whole thing is crazy.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.515
-You know?
They've been dating six months.
-(Randall sighs)

19:00.598 --> 19:02.600
RANDALL:
I think a good thing to focus on

19:02.684 --> 19:03.935
is that, 20 minutes ago,

19:04.019 --> 19:06.271
you were feeling at peace
with your life.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.356
Yeah, well, my life
just changed pretty radically.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.607
Did it?

19:09.691 --> 19:11.985
Just picture yourself at
your wedding, all right?

19:12.068 --> 19:15.739
When she asked you
if you were in love with her,

19:15.822 --> 19:18.199
-would your answer be
any different now?
-(tapping)

19:19.200 --> 19:20.452
(sighs)

19:21.786 --> 19:23.913
I don't know.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.458
-(exhales)
-I don't kn-- I know I'm not
the same person I was back then.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.792
I'm a father now.
That changes you.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.419
-You know that.
-Sure.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.255
And-and, you know...
(sighs)

19:32.339 --> 19:34.090
You saw us together.
We're-we're relaxed,

19:34.174 --> 19:35.550
we're good, we're--
We laugh together.

19:35.633 --> 19:37.385
We-we genuinely enjoy
each other's company.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.429
-You're very cute.
-You know? And the idea

19:39.512 --> 19:41.765
of her marrying somebody else

19:41.848 --> 19:43.600
just makes me feel...

19:45.602 --> 19:47.520
...not good.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.982
So, you know,

19:51.066 --> 19:52.984
-maybe that means...
-Maybe we should
just keep driving

19:53.068 --> 19:55.904
until that thought
leaves your mind.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.910
'Kay. Maybe I should
just text her right now,

20:01.993 --> 20:03.703
-just real quick...
-Stop.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.288
Kevin, you're a 41-year-old man

20:05.372 --> 20:06.831
who makes
rash romantic decisions

20:06.915 --> 20:08.750
that reverberate for decades.

20:08.833 --> 20:12.671
Okay? Now, we're gonna go
on a nice scenic drive,

20:12.754 --> 20:15.298
maybe stop for some boba tea
and not send

20:15.382 --> 20:18.677
a self-destructive text message
to your baby mama.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.846
I'm starting to realize
why your kids didn't want to go

20:21.930 --> 20:23.139
on this trip with you, Randall.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.183
I love you, too.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.768
(sizzling)

20:26.851 --> 20:28.978
(Jack panting)

20:29.062 --> 20:30.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.
Don't get too close.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.691
(grunts)
Huh? It's very hot.

20:32.774 --> 20:33.983
You want to do some cooking
with me?

20:34.067 --> 20:35.694
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:36.736 --> 20:37.946
Oh. You smell that?

20:38.029 --> 20:39.072
-Oh, yeah!
-Take a...

20:39.155 --> 20:40.281
-I...
-Yeah. Take a whiff.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.617
What does that smell like?
(inhales deeply)

20:42.701 --> 20:45.870
It smells like apples and pants.

20:45.954 --> 20:48.206
It does smell like apples
and pants.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.333
That's very good.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.294
No, you're actually on
West Ladera.

20:53.378 --> 20:54.838
You're supposed
to be on East Ladera.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.506
Yes. Just please--
Please just hurry.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.925
Yes, pl-- Thank you.
Plumber's lost.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.678
Hey, Kate,
we can just cancel this party.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.431
It's only some of my bridge
friends and his golf buddies,

21:04.514 --> 21:06.016
-who I don't even like
very much.
-What?

21:06.099 --> 21:07.559
KATE:
Absolutely not, Mom.
I want to do this for you.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.811
(loud creaking)

21:11.146 --> 21:13.231
Hey, hey, hey. Who's in here
banging pots and pans

21:13.314 --> 21:15.567
while I'm trying
to put Hailey down? Ooh.

21:15.650 --> 21:18.278
There's some bad spirits
up in here.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.739
(crackling thud,
liquid splashing)

21:20.822 --> 21:22.240
BETH:
Dear Lord.

21:22.323 --> 21:24.242
-Oh, shoot.
-KATE: Oh, wow. Well,

21:24.325 --> 21:26.202
Toby's always wanted
a frickin' waterbed.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.746
-Well, I'm gonna go get him.
-Okay.
-You've got to get

21:27.829 --> 21:29.998
-this mattress
off of here quick.
-Yeah, I guess.

21:30.081 --> 21:31.332
BETH:
Hey, Toby.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.667
We need you inside.

21:32.751 --> 21:36.004
(sighs) All right,
come on, buddy. Let's go.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.175
-TOBY: Hey, where are you guys?
-(babbling)

21:40.258 --> 21:42.719
Where are you guys?
(giggles)

21:42.802 --> 21:44.137
TOBY:
Oh, my--

21:44.220 --> 21:46.639
What is this? I thought you said
you turned the water off.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.641
I did, Toby, but obviously
enough water was already pumped

21:48.725 --> 21:50.560
into the pipes that it
just blew the ceiling in.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.479
KATE:
Can you just help us instead of,

21:52.562 --> 21:54.314
like, you know, running
your colorful commentary, Toby?

21:54.397 --> 21:56.399
Yeah, let me just,
let me put Jack down.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.860
I got to find Beth. Hey, Beth?

21:58.943 --> 22:00.278
-JACK: Beth?
-Beth... (sighs)

22:00.362 --> 22:02.405
Okay.

22:02.489 --> 22:04.115
(Jack babbling)

22:04.199 --> 22:06.493
-Beth?
-(shushes) I got Hailey.

22:06.576 --> 22:08.703
Yeah, sorry. Okay.

22:08.787 --> 22:11.456
All right, buddy, you, um, you
got to go to your room, okay?

22:11.539 --> 22:13.958
-Here you go.
-KATE: Toby,
where the hell are you?

22:14.042 --> 22:15.293
-TOBY: Stay put, okay?
-My 70-year-old mother

22:15.377 --> 22:16.878
-is picking up this mattress!
-Stay right here.

22:16.961 --> 22:19.089
-I'm coming! Relax.
-KATE: It's heavy. Be careful.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.383
TOBY:
Okay, all right, just slide it,
slide it towards the...

22:21.466 --> 22:23.301
-Toward-towards the window.
-KATE: Get it straight.
-REBECCA: Hey, hey, hey.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.594
-REBECCA: It's, uh...
-TOBY: All right, we have to

22:24.678 --> 22:26.012
-move the bedframe.
-KATE: Yeah, I-I got that.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.514
TOBY:
Here, just get it out
from under...

22:27.597 --> 22:28.556
-(doorbell ringing)
-KATE: Move it forward

22:28.640 --> 22:29.683
so you can open the door.

22:29.766 --> 22:31.434
TOBY:
Would you get the door?

22:31.518 --> 22:32.727
KATE:
Coming!

22:35.689 --> 22:37.982
TOBY:
Slide it towards the...

22:38.066 --> 22:40.026
Oh, thank God. I could hug you.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.028
You want to show me
where the leak is?

22:42.112 --> 22:43.279
Oh, yeah, come in.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.117
All right, so,
it started in the kitchen.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.410
-PLUMBER: Uh-huh.

Who locked Joanie
in the bathroom?

She yelled at Kevin
for not sleeping.

28:33.338 --> 28:35.382
So Kevin locked her
in the bathroom?

28:35.465 --> 28:37.008
No.

You locked her
in the bathroom, Randall?

Randall,

28:42.972 --> 28:44.766
you can tell me.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.101
-Rebecca, please.
-What?

28:46.184 --> 28:48.770
Randall and I talk.
We have a thing.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.356
I did it, okay?
Joanie's not nice.

28:51.439 --> 28:53.900
She calls Kate "Chatty Cathy."

28:53.983 --> 28:55.026
KATE:
Yeah.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.236
Every time I talk.

28:56.319 --> 28:57.946
It hurts her feelings.

28:58.029 --> 29:01.616
The chair under the doorknob
was my idea.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.370
Well, guys, you can't...

29:05.453 --> 29:07.664
you can't lock someone
in a bathroom

29:07.747 --> 29:09.082
just because they hurt
Kate's feelings.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.626
-You understand?
-Why not?

29:11.710 --> 29:13.253
She's our sister.

(indistinct announcement

29:17.382 --> 29:19.300
-Hey, how is he?
-Is he all right?

29:19.384 --> 29:22.846
Um, he has a nasty gash
on his forehead.

29:22.929 --> 29:24.264
He's in getting stitches
right now,

29:24.347 --> 29:25.765
but he's gonna be all right.

29:26.850 --> 29:28.309
Here.

(exhales)

29:30.937 --> 29:32.981
Now can you help me
fill out this paperwork,

29:33.064 --> 29:36.026
because I can't seem to remember
any of his information.

29:36.109 --> 29:37.861
Yeah, okay, yeah.

29:37.944 --> 29:39.738
-We got it.
-Thank you.

Wait, Jack, we have to put
your hands down, bud.

Almost done.

Oh, wait.

was locked.

31:27.721 --> 31:29.347
Not here.

(door opens)

31:37.689 --> 31:39.482

31:41.192 --> 31:44.195
I told you. I told you
to listen for the click.

31:44.279 --> 31:47.032
Yes, I know, I know.

31:47.115 --> 31:48.867
Maybe I would've heard the click

31:48.950 --> 31:51.036
if you weren't yelling
at me all the time.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.996
Oh, God-- Toby, come on.

31:53.079 --> 31:55.457
Look, I thought he was safe.

31:55.540 --> 31:57.667
He was there one minute,
and he was gone the next.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.919
But it wasn't just
one minute, Toby.

32:00.003 --> 32:01.755
It-it wasn't. It was,
it was many, many minutes

32:01.838 --> 32:04.174
between Jack leaving his room
and you even bothering

32:04.257 --> 32:05.925
to notice that he was gone.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.386
Gone out the door
you left unlocked, by the way.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.055
The door you taught him
how to open.

32:10.138 --> 32:12.974
Who does that with a,
with a sighted toddler,

32:13.058 --> 32:14.351
let alone a blind child?

32:14.434 --> 32:16.394
And then this park song
that you do with him?

32:16.478 --> 32:18.355
-Okay-- Dignity...
-Oh...

32:18.438 --> 32:20.398
...independence, confidence,
self-respect.

32:20.482 --> 32:23.485
That's what we need to be
instilling in him now, Toby.

32:23.568 --> 32:25.653
Now. Not when he's 12
or 18 or 32.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.322
So he can get it in his soul,

32:27.405 --> 32:30.575
in his cells, so he knows
that he's not broken.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.620
All you've ever seen
were his limitations.

32:33.703 --> 32:37.332
-(car doors open)
-Okay, okay. You-you need sleep.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.292
KATE:
From the moment
that we brought him home,

32:39.376 --> 32:41.670
all you did was google
eye surgeries that didn't work

32:41.753 --> 32:44.047
instead of holding him.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.841
So you want to blame it on me
not moving to San Francisco?

32:46.925 --> 32:48.510
Fine, but you know what?

32:48.593 --> 32:52.222
The truth is, you pulled away
from us way back then.

32:52.305 --> 32:53.890
You are losing your mind
right now.

32:53.973 --> 32:57.268
Oh, are you gonna go-- Oh, oh,
you're pulling away, Toby! Bye!

32:57.352 --> 32:59.437
-You all right, Kate?
-All I see are his limitations?

32:59.521 --> 33:00.939
You don't see any.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.649
All right? And that's
just irresponsible.

33:02.732 --> 33:04.567
You know what burns me up?

33:04.651 --> 33:07.153
The fact that you think
because you sing with a bunch

33:07.237 --> 33:08.822
of blind kids that that
makes you the only parent

33:08.905 --> 33:10.573
in this family
that can raise one.

33:10.657 --> 33:13.868
I am the only parent
in this family, Toby, period.

33:13.952 --> 33:17.163
That's the way you want it!
That's the way you've made it!

33:17.247 --> 33:18.623
Guys, take it easy, yeah?

33:18.707 --> 33:19.874
(sighs)

33:19.958 --> 33:23.003
Do you even want me
to move back to L.A.?

33:23.086 --> 33:24.212
What?

33:24.295 --> 33:26.631
-Do you?
-Um-- Oh, I'm sorry,

33:26.715 --> 33:28.550
do you not feel wanted
right now, Toby?

33:28.633 --> 33:31.928
I feel judged and blamed
every day.

33:32.012 --> 33:34.139
That's how I feel.
Judged and blamed.

33:34.222 --> 33:35.515

out of her face

33:35.598 --> 33:36.975

How about that?

What-what-what are you talk--
What are you doing here?

33:39.477 --> 33:41.771

here? You're in my house.

33:41.855 --> 33:44.232
-You're in my marriage.
-Well, you're not here!
You're not here, are you? Huh?

lives across the country.
