WEBVTT

00:31.240 --> 00:32.491
Good afternoon.

00:39.081 --> 00:42.084
Sorry, I was waiting for you to ask if--
if I needed anything.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.295
So, this is my mom
and dad's favorite restaurant

00:45.379 --> 00:48.298
and Friday's
their 35th wedding anniversary, Jade.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.259
How do you know my name?

00:51.176 --> 00:54.388
Oh, I don't. That's what
the 35th wedding anniversary is:

00:54.471 --> 00:55.472
Jade.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.976
Oh, weird. What time, then?

00:59.059 --> 01:02.437
Oh, 7:30, three people and really wanna
make sure we get the window table.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.402
You've got all the divisions…

01:08.485 --> 01:09.862
I have to talk to Derrick.

01:09.945 --> 01:11.572
…former England international…

01:12.281 --> 01:13.532
Chris Kamara.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.659
It was an unbelievable performance.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.870
Do you mind just turning that up?
Thank you.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.080
I couldn't believe it!

01:20.163 --> 01:21.415
Looking into the championship now,

01:21.498 --> 01:23.792
Roy, your old mob in Richmond, struggling.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.378
There are a lot of theories
as to why that might be.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.423
One that's gaining traction
is a lack of leadership

01:29.506 --> 01:31.800
from your successor as captain,
Isaac McAdoo.

01:31.884 --> 01:35.345
Isaac's a good lad. He'll find his way.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.974
You know, under Ted Lasso, Richmond, well,

01:39.057 --> 01:42.311
they're like a woman behind the wheel:
completely lost!

01:42.394 --> 01:45.689
George! Didn't you lose your license
drink driving?

01:46.273 --> 01:48.859
That was an allergic reaction
to my medication.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.861
The same medication
that made you piss your pants?

01:56.200 --> 01:57.451
Nothing coming up…

01:57.534 --> 01:58.952
So, did-- Did the--

02:01.872 --> 02:03.207
Hey. Hi.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.167
Good news.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.753
We can set aside
the table in the corner for you.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.963
Wonderful. I just--

02:10.047 --> 02:13.091
I would really like the window table,
you know, just to impress my dad.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.637
I'm sorry. I can't guarantee a reservation
for the window table.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.599
I know Roy Kent, if that's--

02:21.767 --> 02:23.018
Is he your dad?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.186
No.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.439
Well, please let us know
if Mr. Kent ever wants the window table.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.237
Okay. Thank you.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.879
Jan Maas, that's shit defending.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.589
Yes, that goal was entirely my fault.

03:33.672 --> 03:36.633
I don't wanna hear it.
We need to get our shit together!

03:38.510 --> 03:40.888
Hey, hit pause for me, will you?
Hey, fellas.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.140
No, I gave you an indoor whistle.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.100
Listen, I don't care what our record is,

03:45.184 --> 03:48.020
but I hear the chatter, people saying
there's something wrong with us.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.688
Not the way I see it, okay?

03:49.771 --> 03:50.814
And here's why:

03:50.898 --> 03:52.566
I believe in communism.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.653
Rom-communism, that is.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.573
What is rom-communism?

03:59.656 --> 04:01.867
Well, Bumbercatch,
it is a worldview that reminds us

04:01.950 --> 04:05.871
that romantic comedies with folks
like Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan

04:05.954 --> 04:08.540
or Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant or--
Who am I missing, Coach?

04:09.708 --> 04:11.043
Drew Barrymore?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.670
-Matthew McConaughey, obviously.
-All right, all right. Yeah.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.048
-The three Kates.
-Yeah, Beckinsale, Hudson, Winslet.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.176
-You forgot Blanchett.
-Different spelling.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.678
I enjoy Renée Zellweger
and all the Bridget Jones movies.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.639
I mean, her accent is pitch perfect

04:23.722 --> 04:25.891
and her gift of physical comedy
is grossly underrated.

04:25.974 --> 04:27.935
-Word!
-Hell yeah!

04:28.018 --> 04:29.269
-Absolutely!
-I saw Judy…

04:29.353 --> 04:31.104
All right,
you've gotta give it up for Zellweger.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.816
Look, point is, fellas,
if all those attractive people

04:34.900 --> 04:37.277
with their amazing apartments
and interesting jobs,

04:37.361 --> 04:38.862
usually in some creative field,

04:38.946 --> 04:42.282
can go through some lighthearted struggles
and still end up happy,

04:42.366 --> 04:43.367
then so can we.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.536
Jennifer Lopez!

04:46.495 --> 04:48.747
That's a great call, Dani,
and not at all a beat too late.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.792
Gentlemen, believing in rom-communism

04:51.875 --> 04:54.545
is all about believing that everything's
gonna work out in the end.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.713
Now these next few months might be tricky,

04:57.422 --> 04:59.424
but that's just 'cause
we're going through our dark forest.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.761
Fairy tales do not start,
nor do they end in the dark forest.

05:02.845 --> 05:06.056
That son of a gun always shows up
smack-dab in the middle of a story.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.391
But it will all work out.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.017
Now, it may not work out

05:09.101 --> 05:12.312
how you think it will
or how you hope it does,

05:12.396 --> 05:16.817
but believe me, it will all work out.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.777
Exactly as it's supposed to.

05:20.904 --> 05:25.325
Our job is to have zero expectations
and just let go.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.621
Now, you heard him!

05:30.914 --> 05:32.833
We need to stop playing like shit!

05:32.916 --> 05:36.253
Yeah, not exactly what I said,
but I appreciate you, Isaac.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.922
Okay, let's watch the second half.
Come on, Coach.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.054
Hey, anyone know
what's going on with Isaac?

05:46.138 --> 05:47.598
I got no idea. No.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.600
Maybe it's piles.

05:49.683 --> 05:53.979
I've accepted "aubergine" and "snogging",
but "piles" I will not abide.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.274
Wait a second,
we play Sheffield Wednesday?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.985
-Saturday.
-Oh, we're playing Sheffield Saturday?

06:00.068 --> 06:01.653
Sheffield Wednesday, Saturday.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.488
We gotta play 'em twice in the same week?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.868
The club is called Sheffield Wednesday.
We play them on Saturday.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.829
They're called Sheffield Wednesday because
they used to only play on Wednesdays.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.081
But nowadays they play on
whatever day they feel like,

06:13.165 --> 06:15.042
including, but not limited to, Saturdays,

06:15.125 --> 06:17.252
which, again, is the day
we will be playing them.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.921
This Saturday? I can't. I got plans.

06:19.671 --> 06:20.964
-I'm leaving.
-Oh, come on.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.091
-Hey, Doc.
-Good afternoon.

06:23.759 --> 06:25.844
Coach Lasso, is Isaac okay?

06:25.928 --> 06:27.304
No, ma'am, he is not.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.182
He's a wigwam in a tepee right now.

06:30.682 --> 06:31.850
What does that mean?

06:31.934 --> 06:33.769
-He's too tense.
-Boom!

06:34.811 --> 06:36.605
He's wound tighter than my nan's hairnet.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.316
That only makes sense if you know my nan,

06:39.399 --> 06:42.444
but when she wears a hairnet, it looks
like puppies are trying to escape from it.

06:44.613 --> 06:45.697
I am not crazy.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.701
-Do you want me to talk to Isaac?
-No. That's okay. We got it.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.662
I know exactly what Isaac needs.
Thank you, though.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.539
Okay.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.585
-What does Isaac need?
-Oh, I have no idea.

06:59.336 --> 07:00.504
No, usually in this situation

07:00.587 --> 07:03.257
I'd have a player talk to the team captain
before I intervened.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.967
-But Isaac's our captain.
-Exactly.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.302
And I can't very well
ask Isaac to pull himself aside.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.972
'Cause that would be dangerously close
to messing with the, what's it?

07:10.055 --> 07:11.723
-The dark arts?
-No, no.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.016
Space-time continuum?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.393
That's it, yeah.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.187
-Oh.
-Fact is, Isaac is a big dog, you know?

07:17.271 --> 07:19.398
So he's only going to
respond to a big dog himself.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.485
I'll do it.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.240
Oh, you're being serious?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.409
You didn't laugh.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.994
-You knew he was being serious?
-Yeah, man.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.453
Shoot. Busted.

07:34.746 --> 07:38.041
I'm sorry about that, Nate.
But I do appreciate the offer, you know?

07:38.125 --> 07:39.793
I think we gotta get him a real big dog.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.879
Yeah, no, goo-- Me too.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.797
-Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.
-Yeah.

07:43.881 --> 07:46.258
Okay. Let's see here.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.428
I'm okay with "fanny".

07:51.680 --> 07:54.183
One, two, three…

07:58.520 --> 07:59.730
Did you just giggle?

08:00.564 --> 08:01.815
I don't know. Did I?

08:02.983 --> 08:03.984
Maybe.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.361
And now you're doubling down
as Shy Rebecca,

08:06.445 --> 08:07.821
who is a fictional character.

08:07.905 --> 08:09.907
She does not actually exist,
so something's up.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.202
Hey, boys!

08:13.285 --> 08:15.662
Come get your free
Nespresso coffee machines

08:15.746 --> 08:17.456
because I'm amazing at my job!

08:17.539 --> 08:20.834
People who are amazing at their job
don't have to point it out.

08:21.418 --> 08:25.088
Actually, that's not how it works anymore.
It's all about promoting your own brand.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.176
Please don't forget to post
when you make yourselves an Americano.

08:29.259 --> 08:30.844
I'll put something
on my Insta straightaway.

08:30.928 --> 08:31.970
Thanks, Colin. Oh, wait!

08:32.638 --> 08:35.390
Do you think you can make this one post
not about Welsh independence?

08:36.225 --> 08:37.226
Yeah.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.477
Thank you.

08:40.102 --> 08:43.482
So can I, like, give this back to you
and you give me cash?

08:43.565 --> 08:45.150
-Is that a thing, or…
-No.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.027
Oh, yeah. Ok-- Okay.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.489
All right, what the fuck?

08:50.572 --> 08:53.825
Sorry. It's just this mystery man
that I've been talking to on Bantr

08:53.909 --> 08:56.203
has just quoted Rilke.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.873
"Our deepest fears are like dragons
guarding our deepest treasures".

08:59.957 --> 09:02.000
Oh, that is so hot.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.672
Maybe you're writing letters
to a hung poet.

09:07.297 --> 09:08.924
Is that a joke from Sex and The City?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.551
No, but thank you.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.094
I love that you're so excited.

09:12.177 --> 09:16.014
That's so Bantr,
a place where minds can come to undress.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.683
That's really good. I'm gonna use that.

09:17.766 --> 09:18.809
I mean, don't get me wrong,

09:18.892 --> 09:22.604
I'm still chatting to these other guys
on the other dating app, Tumescent.

09:22.688 --> 09:24.273
Yeah, and what was that discourse like?

09:25.274 --> 09:27.401
Less revealing, but more revealing.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.486
Jesus, where's the rest of it?

09:31.029 --> 09:32.030
Christ.

09:32.114 --> 09:34.575
I mean, shouldn't romance
have a little mystery to it?

09:35.742 --> 09:37.077
Sure, it depends on what you want.

09:37.995 --> 09:41.039
See? It all comes back to branding,
even with love.

09:42.708 --> 09:43.709
Yeah.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.839
Oh, Dani! Enjoy your free coffee.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.967
Oh, I don't drink coffee.
My mother says I was born caffeinated.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.594
Is it okay if I give it to my neighbor?

09:53.677 --> 09:55.596
She also doesn't drink coffee
but her son does.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.681
And she's trying to encourage
more visits from him.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.932
Sure!

09:59.016 --> 10:00.726
-¡Excelente!
-Oh, yeah!

10:00.809 --> 10:02.853
-Oh, wow. Look at this.
-Sorry, Nate.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.605
They're actually just for the players.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.523
Oh, good.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.067
I hate free coffee anyway,
always tastes so…

10:11.904 --> 10:13.113
Yeah. Fine.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.719
Hello, Rebecca.

10:36.637 --> 10:37.638
Hello, Higgins.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.389
What can I help you with?

10:39.473 --> 10:40.933
Payroll.

10:42.267 --> 10:45.103
We have an inquiry from AFC Wrexham.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.231
Just got a call from their new owners,

10:47.314 --> 10:49.691
showbiz magnates Rob McElhenney
and Ryan Reynolds.

10:50.442 --> 10:53.487
I can't tell if them buying the club
is a joke or not,

10:53.570 --> 10:55.072
so I haven't replied to them yet.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.408
Right.
Did you just see what was on my screen?

10:59.034 --> 11:00.577
Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.371
I have five boys.

11:02.454 --> 11:05.165
I never look over anyone's shoulders
to see what's on their screens.

11:07.084 --> 11:08.168
I used to.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.254
Oh, apologies!

11:10.337 --> 11:12.381
That's my wife.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.633
I'll ring her back later. Keeps it fresh.

11:15.801 --> 11:18.470
But I'll just text her real quick
to let her know that.

11:19.263 --> 11:22.975
So your ringtone for your wife is
"She's a Rainbow" by the Rolling Stones?

11:23.058 --> 11:25.352
-Yeah.
-That's awfully affectionate.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.396
Yeah, well, it's our song.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.648
It was playing the moment we met.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.485
And it's not an exaggeration.
She really is my rainbow.

11:34.945 --> 11:37.573
It is so odd to imagine you young.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.283
Yeah, I get that a lot.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.618
I was the only kid in primary school
with sciatica.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.038
I had a gelatinous L4 and five.

11:46.582 --> 11:48.333
Leslie, do you mind me asking,

11:48.417 --> 11:50.252
when you first met your wife,

11:50.335 --> 11:53.088
how did you put yourself across?

11:53.172 --> 11:55.632
You know, what was your brand?

11:55.716 --> 11:56.925
"Brand"?

11:57.551 --> 12:00.262
Well, you know, the night I met my wife,

12:00.345 --> 12:04.266
I was attempting to be a brooding punk
with hair spiked out to here.

12:04.349 --> 12:08.770
And then "She's a Rainbow" came on
and I started playing upright air bass

12:08.854 --> 12:12.191
but I had a pint in my hand and ended up
pouring beer all over my head.

12:13.317 --> 12:15.068
Everyone in the bar laughed,

12:15.152 --> 12:19.364
except one person who handed me
a damp, disgusting bar towel.

12:20.949 --> 12:23.160
And I've been married to her for 29 years.

12:25.162 --> 12:29.917
I suppose…
the best brand is just being yourself.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.107
It's fine.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.290
-Nate?
-Yeah?

13:10.374 --> 13:11.375
Do you need something?

13:11.458 --> 13:14.586
No, me? No, me? No, thank you. No, but--

13:19.550 --> 13:22.344
Actually, there is possibly one thing
you might be able to help with.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.512
Yeah, come sit down.

13:23.595 --> 13:24.847
Oh, thank you.

13:32.437 --> 13:33.522
Can you make me famous?

13:34.523 --> 13:36.775
No! Nate, you don't wanna be famous.

13:36.859 --> 13:37.901
I don't?

13:37.985 --> 13:40.737
No!
There'll be photographers all up your bum.

13:40.821 --> 13:41.989
Oh. Yuck.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.866
Yeah,
and tabloids going through your rubbish.

13:43.949 --> 13:44.908
I don't want that.

13:44.992 --> 13:47.286
-Groupies everywhere?
-That's not horrible.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.370
Nate.

13:48.453 --> 13:50.539
Come on. You are who you are
because of who you are.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.667
Your intelligence and your talent.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.712
You don't wanna go messing around
with fame.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.175
I don't know, being famous seems to have
some perks though, right?

14:01.758 --> 14:03.886
Famous people get sent so much free shit.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.888
Lot of the time they don't figure out
what they want.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.932
I know what I want.
A window table at a restaurant.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.017
Is that it?

14:10.100 --> 14:11.977
Well, that plus maybe
some of those groupies

14:12.060 --> 14:13.228
you mentioned earlier, but--

14:14.271 --> 14:16.273
No, obviously not.
That's-- that's degrading.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.733
I didn't mean to-- Sorry.

14:17.816 --> 14:18.942
Come with me.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.405
Come on!

14:30.495 --> 14:32.581
Nathan needs a table at a restaurant.

14:33.332 --> 14:34.333
Excellent.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.668
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester?

14:36.752 --> 14:38.003
L'Atelier Robuchon.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.214
Chiltern Firehouse!

14:40.297 --> 14:43.842
No-- It's A Taste of Athens in Tooting.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.011
Did he just say, "Tooting"?

14:46.094 --> 14:48.931
Tooting. It's his parents' favorite place.

14:49.515 --> 14:52.059
Well, it's the place
that my dad complains about the least.

14:52.142 --> 14:55.145
Wait, you can't get a table
at something called "A Taste of Athens"

14:55.229 --> 14:56.563
in Tooting?

14:56.647 --> 14:57.940
No, it's impossible.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.025
All right.
Well, there's a simple solution to that.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.235
I'll just buy the restaurant.

15:02.694 --> 15:04.238
Well, you know the saying?

15:04.321 --> 15:06.240
"You buy a man a table, he eats once.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.408
You teach a man how to get a table

15:08.492 --> 15:10.827
and he eats at that restaurant
until it becomes a Starbucks."

15:10.911 --> 15:14.623
Oh, this is silly!
Nathan, just be assertive.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.959
Yes. Yes. Yes.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.460
Brilliant. Spectacular.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.004
Lovely. Wonderful. It's wonderful.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.464
Perfect.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.842
Sorry, we just-- No.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.011
Oh, my God.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.556
We've got work to do.

15:36.728 --> 15:41.233
I told you, either you take down my photo
or you start giving me free kebabs.

15:41.859 --> 15:43.026
7.50, mate.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.194
Fair enough.

15:46.071 --> 15:47.072
No way!

15:47.155 --> 15:49.116
Fancy running into you here,

15:49.199 --> 15:52.494
after asking Keeley where you were
and scootin' my boot right over, that is.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.662
She told me to expect

15:53.745 --> 15:56.540
a mustachioed surprise
that would anger me.

15:59.209 --> 16:02.504
I thought it was gonna be Wario
or my great-aunt Natalie.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.256
I don't know what makes
your aunt Natalie so great,

16:04.339 --> 16:06.592
but I appreciate your effusiveness,
despite her appearance.

16:08.719 --> 16:10.220
I'll have what he's having.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.517
Why are you bothering me
at my kebab place?

16:15.601 --> 16:17.311
This is like my church.

16:17.394 --> 16:20.314
Who knew transubstantiation
could happen with a pita?

16:22.399 --> 16:23.901
What do you think
about joining the coaching staff?

16:23.984 --> 16:25.360
Fuck off.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.529
That's a solid negotiation tactic
right there.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.364
I don't wanna coach.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.825
I like what I'm doing and I'm good at it.

16:31.909 --> 16:35.871
People tweet about me,
with JIFs and everything.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.332
I know some folks
pronounce it "GIFs", but I hear you.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.876
Look,
if you enjoy doing the whole pundit thing,

16:40.959 --> 16:42.753
then you should do it
for the rest of your life.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.255
Why won't you let me be happy?

16:46.215 --> 16:48.091
-Here you go, mate.
-Thank you.

16:49.134 --> 16:52.095
-You two are father and son, right?
-What? No.

16:52.971 --> 16:53.972
I'm his former coach.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.641
It's all the same thing.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.851
You two remind me
of me and my old man when I told him

16:57.935 --> 17:00.354
I was leaving medical school
a week before graduation.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.522
I bet that's a story.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.774
Would have made a great doctor too.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.108
I was really good at it.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.529
Bedside manner,
reading charts, cutting up shit.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.574
But it's just not what I was meant to do.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.411
What? I love making a doner kebab.

17:17.788 --> 17:20.082
Anyway, how's that kebab, my friend?

17:20.165 --> 17:22.542
Well, to quote Drizzy,
it's the best I ever had.

17:22.626 --> 17:24.586
Good, right? Cool.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.424
Look, Roy, all kibbles and bits aside,

17:30.008 --> 17:32.636
I'm really just here to ask you
for a favor for an old friend.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.304
One Mr. Isaac McAdoo.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.015
He's all up in his head, isn't he?

17:37.099 --> 17:40.227
Yes, he is. And I need him
to check out of there by Saturday.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.311
You got any ideas?

17:43.605 --> 17:45.524
Let me finish my kebab and pray on it.

17:50.946 --> 17:51.947
Right there.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.867
For the collection plate.

17:54.950 --> 17:55.951
Later, skater.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.791
Well, this place is ruined now.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.254
Hello, sir. Can I help you?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.382
Yes. Nathan Shelley, party of three.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.301
Let's see, Mr. Shelby.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.344
Yes, Shelby.
Sorry, I should have said Shelby.

18:15.012 --> 18:16.638
No. That is not your name.

18:16.722 --> 18:17.973
-It's pretty close.
-No, no!

18:18.056 --> 18:19.641
Start again, from the top.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.937
-May I help you?
-Yes, Shelley, party of three.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.522
Yes! Mr. Shelfy.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.524
It's Shelley, and you know it,
you dithering kestrel!

18:27.608 --> 18:29.443
-Jesus.
-No.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.527
Too much.

18:31.528 --> 18:34.531
You don't need to be loud, Nathan.
You just need to be commanding.

18:34.615 --> 18:37.075
With all due respect,
it's different for me, Miss Welton.

18:37.159 --> 18:38.785
You command every room you walk into.

18:38.869 --> 18:40.579
Oh-- Hardly.

18:40.662 --> 18:43.040
Have you ever been in a room
full of football club chairmen?

18:43.123 --> 18:44.124
No.

18:44.208 --> 18:45.792
Every time I walk into
one of those meetings,

18:45.876 --> 18:48.212
they look at me like some schoolgirl
with pigtails.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.881
-Oh, you'd look well fit with pigtails.
-I do.

18:50.964 --> 18:51.965
But I have a secret:

18:53.050 --> 18:54.801
I make myself big.

18:54.885 --> 18:56.595
Before I go into the room,

18:56.678 --> 18:59.306
I find somewhere private,
I stand up on my tiptoes,

18:59.389 --> 19:02.184
put my arms in the air
and make myself as big as possible

19:02.267 --> 19:03.352
to feel my own power.

19:05.604 --> 19:06.605
Like this.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.748
Fuck, you're amazing. Let's invade France.

19:26.333 --> 19:29.378
It's a bit silly, but it works for me.
Find your own thing.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.463
But don't back down, Nathan.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.508
You deserve whatever you want.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.468
Yeah.

19:40.472 --> 19:42.599
What the hell are we gonna do
with Roy anyway?

19:42.683 --> 19:45.185
Same thing you do when you cross
an elephant with a rhinoceros,

19:45.269 --> 19:46.270
hell if I know.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.440
Look, Roy just told me to bring you
to this address, ready to play.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.442
I didn't press him for details.
You know how he gets.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.987
-Fucking crabby, ain't he?
-Heck yeah.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.281
Ain't no side-eye
like a Roy Kent side-eye.

19:57.364 --> 19:59.199
It's like he's 24-7 hangry.

19:59.867 --> 20:00.868
365.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.911
366 on leap years, baby.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.747
Seriously, do you know where you're going?

20:05.831 --> 20:07.040
Well, no. This is it.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.293
Here, I'll just text him.
Let him know we're here.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.258
-Yeah, Roy?
-McAdoo.

20:16.341 --> 20:17.968
What we doing here? What--

20:39.156 --> 20:40.282
See that block of flats?

20:41.700 --> 20:44.077
-What? The shit one?
-That's where I grew up.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.414
This…

20:48.081 --> 20:49.416
This is where I lived.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.210
Where I learned football.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.337
Every fucking day.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.882
And during my career,
when I was going through a bad patch,

20:56.965 --> 20:59.092
I'd come back here and play.

21:02.346 --> 21:03.764
This is Isaac.

21:05.098 --> 21:07.809
These are all the other fucks.
You're with them.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.395
You what? You expect me to play with them?

21:11.563 --> 21:13.815
I'm a professional, mate.
I'll fucking kill 'em.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.321
We'll see.

21:20.364 --> 21:22.449
-What about me? What do I get to do?
-Nothing.

21:22.533 --> 21:23.909
Come on. Can I keep score?

21:23.992 --> 21:25.452
Fine.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.162
All right, I'm gonna use my fingers.

21:27.246 --> 21:28.330
It's zero-zero!

21:28.413 --> 21:30.624
-Nil-nil.
-It is nil-nil.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.051
Hello. Shelley, party of three.

21:41.134 --> 21:43.095
Let's see, Shelley.

21:43.178 --> 21:44.304
No! My name--

21:44.388 --> 21:46.807
Sorry, yes, that's correct.

21:46.890 --> 21:50.185
In fact, that's all our names.
That's my dad there and my mum as well.

21:50.269 --> 21:51.937
Yeah, we're all Shelleys.

21:52.020 --> 21:54.189
-A gaggle of Shelleys.
-Stop blabbing up the young lady.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.024
-Your mother's hungry.
-Stop it, Lloyd.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.526
Forgive your father, my darling.

21:57.609 --> 22:00.195
He's been wanting this saganaki all week.

22:00.737 --> 22:04.616
As you may remember,
it's their 35th wedding anniversary. Jade.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.493
Of course.

22:08.537 --> 22:09.538
Right this way.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.760
Sorry, if you remember,
I requested the window table?

22:23.844 --> 22:26.555
Sorry, we don't take reservations
for the window table.

22:31.852 --> 22:33.145
Excuse me one moment.

22:58.003 --> 23:00.839
You are Nathan fucking Shelley.

23:10.641 --> 23:11.642
Be right back.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.060
Don't get too comfortable.

23:20.275 --> 23:23.028
Jade,
this is a special night for my parents,

23:23.111 --> 23:24.404
and the window table is open.

23:24.488 --> 23:26.865
So,
here is what I would love to see happen.

23:28.033 --> 23:29.660
You're gonna give us that table,

23:29.743 --> 23:31.912
and then my family and I
are gonna order a starter,

23:31.995 --> 23:34.456
main course, little dessert,
a bottle of wine.

23:34.540 --> 23:38.043
And you are going to be stunned
by how quickly a gaggle of Shelleys

23:38.126 --> 23:40.379
can get through a three-course meal
and get out of here.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.505
So what do you say?

23:42.381 --> 23:43.382
Okay.

23:46.552 --> 23:48.011
Mum, Dad.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.472
Perhaps you'd like to give me
your number as well?

23:50.556 --> 23:52.140
No, that's okay.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.434
Sorry, I'm picky.

23:55.644 --> 23:56.645
Me too. I--

23:57.938 --> 23:59.106
I'm not a dog.

24:08.198 --> 24:09.199
Thank you.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.255
Hey, Roy! Sure you don't wanna play?

24:23.338 --> 24:25.591
You on one leg is better
than this fool on two.

24:36.185 --> 24:37.561
Take that, you little bitch.

24:37.644 --> 24:41.899
Easy, mate. I think you hurt him.
Emotionally.

24:43.066 --> 24:46.612
What the fuck, Roy? Did you bring me
'round here to get my leg broke?

24:46.695 --> 24:47.696
No.

24:47.779 --> 24:52.201
I brought you here to remind you
that football is a fucking game

24:52.284 --> 24:54.203
that you used to play as a fucking kid.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.495
'Cause it was fun,

24:55.996 --> 24:58.123
even when you were getting
your fucking legs broken

24:58.207 --> 24:59.625
or your fucking feelings hurt.

25:00.209 --> 25:01.460
So, fuck your feelings,

25:01.543 --> 25:04.379
fuck your overthinking,
fuck all that bullshit,

25:04.463 --> 25:08.884
go back out there
and have some fucking fun.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.264
All right, game on.

25:19.978 --> 25:21.063
Was that all right?

25:21.605 --> 25:22.606
That was great.

25:23.607 --> 25:24.650
Too many fucks?

25:25.526 --> 25:26.777
I don't know.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.196
Kinda like all the nipples
in that movie, Showgirls.

25:29.279 --> 25:30.697
Halfway through, you don't even notice.

25:30.781 --> 25:33.158
You just kinda get sucked
into the narrative.

25:34.368 --> 25:36.078
I dated Gina Gershon once.

25:37.579 --> 25:38.872
That makes me happy.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.166
Get off me!

25:53.887 --> 25:55.138
Come on.

26:06.275 --> 26:07.526
All right. Come on!

26:16.994 --> 26:18.745
You gotta be kidding me.

26:19.329 --> 26:20.372
Come on!

26:23.959 --> 26:26.086
McAdoodle-doo!

26:26.587 --> 26:28.213
McAdoodle-doo!

26:28.297 --> 26:29.464
Come on!

26:36.930 --> 26:38.432
Nice work tonight, Coach.

26:38.515 --> 26:40.601
Do you really think
I'm gonna fall for this shit?

26:40.684 --> 26:41.810
Fall for what?

26:42.644 --> 26:45.606
You're trying to get me
to come back to the club and coach.

26:45.689 --> 26:46.732
It won't work.

26:46.815 --> 26:48.400
Roy, I got zero interest--

26:48.483 --> 26:52.070
Excuse me, nil interest in making you
do something that ain't in your heart.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.199
So, you're really not playing games?

26:55.282 --> 26:56.450
Maybe a little.

26:57.451 --> 26:58.452
I'm sorry, Roy,

26:59.369 --> 27:01.288
but I came here tonight
'cause when you realize

27:01.371 --> 27:03.999
you wanna spend the rest of your life
coaching with somebody,

27:04.082 --> 27:06.043
you want the rest of your life
to begin ASAP.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.711
Please stop.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.796
You complete our team.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.131
You're an asshole.

27:11.215 --> 27:14.760
I'm also just a coach,
standing in front of a boy,

27:14.843 --> 27:16.136
-asking him if--
-Listen,

27:16.220 --> 27:18.347
I'm never coming back to Richmond.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.182
Not now, not ever.

27:21.808 --> 27:22.976
Now fuck off.

27:27.231 --> 27:28.565
As you wish.

27:38.909 --> 27:40.786
Hey, I'm sorry about that, Coach.

27:40.869 --> 27:44.623
-Set your alarm for p.m. instead of a.m.?
-Yes, sir, Steve Kerr. Thank you.

27:44.706 --> 27:46.959
-Still, you got down here pretty quick.
-Yeah, well,

27:47.042 --> 27:49.670
I think a fella should only take as long
as the tune "Easy Lover"

27:49.753 --> 27:52.256
by Phil Collins and Philip Bailey
to get dressed in the morning.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.799
-Makes sense.
-Yeah.

27:54.466 --> 27:58.637
It is a beautiful Saturday,
and we are playing Sheffield Wednesday.

27:58.720 --> 28:00.848
-Aka "The Owls."
-Hey, how 'bout that?

28:00.931 --> 28:02.558
Hey, you never finished your joke.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.184
What joke?

28:04.268 --> 28:05.727
What does a British owl say?

28:06.228 --> 28:07.271
Oh, right.

28:08.021 --> 28:09.982
Whom. Whom.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.277
Worth the wait.

28:30.210 --> 28:32.296
We had season tickets for Richmond.

28:32.379 --> 28:33.839
My family was well-off.

28:33.922 --> 28:36.133
I was a young punk
that snuck in every week.

28:36.216 --> 28:38.719
My father wanted us in
the best seats in the house.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.346
I sat there because she was there.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.765
My mother and my boyfriend were furious.

28:43.849 --> 28:46.018
They wanted to call security
to kick him out.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.936
But she insisted that I should stay.

28:48.478 --> 28:51.481
-And we fell in love.
-And we fell in love.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.110
Years later, a close friend of the family

28:55.194 --> 28:58.197
used the same story line
for the film Titanic.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.407
And we've been in litigation ever since.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.327
-Together.
-Together.

29:05.579 --> 29:07.956
-Come on, Richmond!
-Richmond!

29:24.056 --> 29:25.849
Just stop with the foreplay.

29:25.933 --> 29:28.227
Tell him you own Richmond
and that you're fucking fit.

29:42.491 --> 29:43.867
-Coach.
-Doctor.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.744
Floor. Ceiling.

29:45.827 --> 29:46.954
Trash can.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.121
Now you go.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.958
I was just checking in.
See how you're feeling.

29:51.041 --> 29:53.043
Oh, well, that's mighty nice of you.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.461
How am I feeling?

29:54.545 --> 29:55.546
I don't know, you know?

29:55.629 --> 29:58.715
I-- I'm just dealing with the terror
of knowing what this world is about,

29:58.799 --> 30:00.008
you know?

30:00.092 --> 30:02.553
Watching a few good friends
screaming to let them out.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.305
So, you're feeling under pressure?

30:05.389 --> 30:06.974
Ba ba ba be doo

30:08.016 --> 30:09.852
Well, my door is always open.

30:09.935 --> 30:10.978
Then why even have one?

30:11.061 --> 30:13.730
Heck, Coach Beard could take
that thing out for ya Jack Torrance style

30:13.814 --> 30:14.857
with eight good whacks.

30:14.940 --> 30:16.191
Five good whacks.

30:16.275 --> 30:18.485
Lumberjack World Championship qualifier,
baby!

30:19.778 --> 30:22.030
That man has had many lives, many masters.

30:22.114 --> 30:24.616
Oh, snap! Hottie alert. Look at this guy.

30:25.409 --> 30:26.952
Hot-cha-cha.

30:27.035 --> 30:28.370
Game day suit. I love it.

30:28.453 --> 30:29.746
Not too much?

30:29.830 --> 30:31.665
What? Too much class? No such thing.

30:35.085 --> 30:38.088
If you are out to describe the truth,
leave elegance to the tailor.

30:41.675 --> 30:45.345
Hey, I appreciate you checking in, Doc.
All right. Let's go, Greyhounds!

30:46.346 --> 30:47.556
And we're back.

30:47.639 --> 30:48.974
Let's round off the Premier League

30:49.057 --> 30:51.476
with Arsenal heading
on the road to Newcastle,

30:51.560 --> 30:54.688
where 17-year-old Matthew Kerr
will make his debut.

30:54.771 --> 30:58.192
They're calling him the Irish Ronaldo.
What can we expect today?

30:58.275 --> 31:01.278
Well, I think we can expect to see
a commanding performance from the lad.

31:01.361 --> 31:03.238
Roy, what do you think he'll do today?

31:03.322 --> 31:05.699
I don't know. He's 17.

31:05.782 --> 31:08.160
He'll probably have chips for dinner
and a wank before bed.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.412
Oh, apologies for the language.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.998
Roy, I was looking for some insight

31:13.582 --> 31:15.042
about how he'll play.

31:15.125 --> 31:16.418
I told you, I don't know.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.379
All we do is sit around here

31:19.463 --> 31:22.132
and guess what a bunch of little pricks
are gonna go and do out there,

31:22.216 --> 31:23.383
then we come back at halftime,

31:23.467 --> 31:26.720
and we complain 'cause they didn't do
exactly what we thought they'd do.

31:27.930 --> 31:29.223
We don't know.

31:30.891 --> 31:32.351
Of course we don't know.

31:34.311 --> 31:36.021
We're not in the locker rooms with them.

31:36.104 --> 31:37.439
We're not on the pitch with them.

31:37.523 --> 31:40.192
We can't look 'em in the eyes
and encourage them to be better

31:40.275 --> 31:42.444
than they ever thought
they were capable of being.

31:43.862 --> 31:44.863
We're just--

31:46.031 --> 31:48.575
We're just on the outside looking in.

31:50.327 --> 31:51.328
Judging them.

31:54.248 --> 31:55.499
Okay, Roy.

31:55.582 --> 31:59.878
Well, here's a look at your old team
warming up in an interesting new way.

31:59.962 --> 32:01.463
Hey!

32:13.892 --> 32:15.978
Look,
it's all pretty loosey-goosey, isn't it?

32:16.061 --> 32:17.145
Especially for a team

32:17.229 --> 32:19.481
that's at the business end
of the relegation zone.

32:19.565 --> 32:22.401
But it is good
to see McAdoo with a smile on his face.

32:22.484 --> 32:25.320
He's been a shadow of himself all season.

32:25.404 --> 32:27.823
I wonder what's gotten into him.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.825
Oh, dang.
Yeah, come on, now. Come on, man.

32:29.908 --> 32:32.327
Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom.

32:32.828 --> 32:33.829
Pow.

32:34.746 --> 32:36.623
There you go. All right. Gentleman.

32:41.003 --> 32:43.714
Bloody cold out there today.
Bet you don't miss that, Roy.

32:44.214 --> 32:45.257
What?

32:45.340 --> 32:47.593
Said,
I bet you don't miss the cold, hey, Roy?

32:49.178 --> 32:50.429
I miss all of it.

32:52.181 --> 32:53.182
'Scuse me.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.101
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry, fellas.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.103
This isn't what I'm meant to do.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.193
Roy!

33:05.986 --> 33:08.989
Jeff, I have to go.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.229
Thank you. Cheers, Ben.

33:42.856 --> 33:44.691
-You're Roy Kent.
-No, I'm not.

33:45.734 --> 33:47.819
All right, I am. Take me to Nelson Road.

33:47.903 --> 33:49.112
No. Headed home.

33:49.196 --> 33:51.573
It's me anniversary, mate,
and I haven't bought a present.

33:55.702 --> 33:56.954
Fuck.

33:58.121 --> 34:00.332
Right, my wife loves cash.

34:00.415 --> 34:01.416
Cheers.

34:20.060 --> 34:22.478
Sorry, mate,
this is as far as I can get ya.

34:24.523 --> 34:27.442
I'll tell you the thing Nikki Sixx said
in the Mötley Crüe Behind the Music.

34:27.525 --> 34:29.570
-"You gotta date your wife."
-Thanks, Roy.

34:36.952 --> 34:38.203
Fuck!

34:39.288 --> 34:41.331
Fuck. Fuck.

34:45.668 --> 34:46.795
You see this new watch?

34:46.879 --> 34:49.214
You get me to Nelson Road
in ten minutes, it's yours.

34:49.297 --> 34:50.299
Get in.

35:08.525 --> 35:09.860
Cheers.

35:11.028 --> 35:12.321
No!

35:18.076 --> 35:19.703
-I've gotta get in there.
-Do you have a ticket?

35:19.786 --> 35:22.623
-I can't let anyone in without a ticket.
-I'm Roy Kent.

35:22.706 --> 35:23.999
-He does look like him.
-A little.

35:24.082 --> 35:25.209
Around the mouth.

35:25.292 --> 35:26.376
For fuck's sake.

35:29.922 --> 35:32.216
I believe you're holding a ticket
for Reba McEntire.

35:39.598 --> 35:41.642
Good to see you back, Reba.

35:43.393 --> 35:45.187
Dad. Dad.

35:48.357 --> 35:49.942
-Enjoy the game.
-Fuck you.

35:50.025 --> 35:51.026
It is you.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.114
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

36:36.363 --> 36:37.364
Look!

36:42.703 --> 36:45.163
Holy shit.

36:45.247 --> 36:48.792
He's here! He's there!
He's every fucking where!

36:48.876 --> 36:52.004
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

36:52.087 --> 36:54.381
He's here! Here's there!
He's every fucking where!

36:54.464 --> 36:57.384
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

37:19.740 --> 37:20.908
Hello, Coach.

37:22.242 --> 37:23.952
-Really glad you decided to--
-Shut up.

37:24.453 --> 37:25.662
Just shut up.

37:26.663 --> 37:28.373
You had me at "Coach."
