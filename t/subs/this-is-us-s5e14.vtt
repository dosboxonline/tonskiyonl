Thanks for letting me take a look around.

00:39.914 --> 00:41.624
-Sure.
-I'll admit,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.668
I was skeptical when I heard

00:43.752 --> 00:45.128
a councilman's wife from New Jersey

00:45.211 --> 00:47.505
wanted to rent my space
to open a dance studio.

(chuckles):
Listen, you and me both, okay?

00:50.759 --> 00:52.719
Well, I've got to hand it to you.
The place looks great.

00:52.802 --> 00:54.804
-When do you open?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.389

dry Lucky Charms like that

06:08.785 --> 06:10.412

06:10.495 --> 06:12.372
-Will you keep an eye on her?
-Uh,

06:12.455 --> 06:14.499
Randall, I've got some stuff on my plate

06:14.582 --> 06:15.875

-Oh, my God, no.

06:20.964 --> 06:24.050

I'm good,

06:24.134 --> 06:26.761

-Okay.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.430

06:42.152 --> 06:44.070

06:44.154 --> 06:45.655
(groans) I'm second-guessing

06:45.739 --> 06:47.532
inviting your mom
wedding dress shopping today.

06:47.615 --> 06:49.617
Yeah, how exactly did that happen again?

06:49.701 --> 06:52.078
Uh, we were on a group FaceTime
with the babies,

06:52.162 --> 06:53.705
and Kate started talking about it,

06:53.788 --> 06:56.583
and your mom just had this...
look on her face.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.335
-I mean, what was I supposed to do?
-Oh, come on.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.836
You know my mom. She loves you.

06:59.919 --> 07:02.047
Uh, no. No, no, no. I know <i>Kate's</i> mom.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.174
I-I'm great with Kate's mom.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.177
-But Kevin's mom?
No idea how that's gonna go.
-Ah.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.304
-I-I'm gonna say
something weird. I just will.
-Okay.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.348
Uh, my old improv coach,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.308
he used to have us play this game called

07:13.391 --> 07:14.476
-"Good, Bad, Worse."
-Huh.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.602
Helped loosen us up.
Do you know how to play?

07:15.685 --> 07:16.895
-Mm-mm.
-Okay.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.229
So, basically, it's like this.

07:18.313 --> 07:21.775
Um, I'm dreading seeing my director

07:21.858 --> 07:24.235
for the screening of my movie
this afternoon, okay?

07:24.319 --> 07:26.905
So, what do I say when I see him?
All right, good.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.199
(exhales)
"Nice to see you, Foster.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.742
"Thank you for being so understanding

07:30.825 --> 07:32.160
"when I stormed off your movie set

07:32.243 --> 07:34.829
and left you and De Niro
completely stranded."

07:34.913 --> 07:36.706
Bad. Um...

07:36.790 --> 07:38.625
"Hey, Three-Names.
Let's screen this sucker."

07:38.708 --> 07:40.126
Right? And then worse.
Uh...

07:40.210 --> 07:43.254
"What's up, you pretentious jagweed?!

07:43.338 --> 07:45.674
Let's screen your stupid movie."

07:45.757 --> 07:47.425
-Right? Okay, so now-now you go.
-Okay.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.677
-You see my mom for the first...
-(clears throat)

07:48.760 --> 07:49.969
-Oh, we're performing. Okay.
-Yeah.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.137
-(grunts)
-What do you... What do you say?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.640
-Good, bad, worse. Go.
-Okay. Uh... Good.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.393
"Rebecca! Hi.
You look radiant."

07:56.476 --> 07:59.437
-(whispers): Good.
-Bad. Um...

07:59.521 --> 08:02.023
"Hey, girl.
I have hella mommy issues,

08:02.107 --> 08:03.775
so thanks for being a Band-Aid."

08:03.858 --> 08:06.528
-Wow.
-Okay, worse.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.071
-Uh... This is hard.
-No, no, no.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.447
Don't hold back.
Let her rip.

08:09.531 --> 08:10.865
-You sure?
-Fire away.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.826
Okay.
Um, worse.

08:12.909 --> 08:16.329
"Sup, Rebecca?
How's the Alzheimer's?"

08:16.413 --> 08:18.581
-Wow.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. No, no.

08:18.665 --> 08:19.666
-I know. I'm so sorry.
-Wow. No. No.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.042
-It's fine. No, no, no.
-I'm so sorry.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.794
-Listen, definitely don't say that.
-I know.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.879
-You're gonna be fine.
-Okay.
-(phone vibrating)

08:24.963 --> 08:27.590
And that's my dad.
Again.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.135
The man sees me engaged
on a magazine cover,

08:30.218 --> 08:32.804
and suddenly, he's calling me
for the first time

08:32.887 --> 08:34.305
-in a year and a half.
-Mm.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.932
Yeah, he wants to know

08:36.016 --> 08:37.517
how early should he come in
for the wedding,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.394
which movies of yours should he
be watching ahead of time.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.604
I mean, the man is out of his mind.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.106
Well, come on.
I mean, you're not even

08:43.189 --> 08:45.191
just a little bit happy that he's coming?

08:45.275 --> 08:46.693
Please.
You'll see.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.236
-(door opens)
-Okay.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.156
Hey, Uncle Nicky.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.782
You, uh...

08:52.866 --> 08:54.659

08:54.743 --> 08:56.619
I don't look ready?

08:56.703 --> 08:58.288
Well...

08:59.664 --> 09:02.751
Hey, Tobe?
The shower thing happened again.

09:02.834 --> 09:05.837
I regret to inform you
that it is no longer

09:05.920 --> 09:07.630
just a shower thing.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.716
(Kate sighs)

09:09.799 --> 09:12.594
-Okay, well, time to call
the plumber, I guess.
-Uh,

09:12.677 --> 09:15.138
excuse me.
I can migrate a Windows server

09:15.221 --> 09:17.932
to Ubuntu in a weekend.
I think I can fix a leaky pipe.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.477
Okay, I-I don't know what you just said,

09:20.560 --> 09:23.063
but I do know that you're not a plumber.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.147
Just call someone.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.316
Look, I'm telling you I can do this.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.276
Okay?
And plumbers are expensive.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.986
We're not exactly swimming in it
at the moment.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.072
-Dad joke intended.
-Okay, well,

09:32.155 --> 09:34.866
it's gonna be more expensive
if there's water damage or mold

09:34.949 --> 09:36.743
-or...
-Kate, I'll fix it.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.495
Promise.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.539
Okay.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.583
Um, don't forget

09:43.667 --> 09:45.627
I'm going dress shopping
with Madison and my mom,

09:45.710 --> 09:47.045
-and then I...
-And then you're teaching choir later.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.380
-Have fun.
-Yeah.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.882
Oh, I taught the class
a new song this week.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.176
It's a total throwback,
but I think they like it.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.761

10:40.974 --> 10:42.100
And a job will do you good.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.070
Olivia is the nicest person in my office.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.655
She'll make a great boss.

10:55.739 --> 10:57.449
We could take our lunches together...

10:57.532 --> 10:58.700
Oh, God.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.952
Just go break a leg, Bug.

11:01.036 --> 11:01.953
I love you.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.039
Proud of you.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.082
(gasps)
Oh, I'm late. Okay, I got to go.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.251
-Good luck.
-Bye.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.215
(sighs)

11:14.299 --> 11:16.593
(laughing)

11:17.844 --> 11:19.846
What? What's wrong with it?
(chuckles)

11:19.929 --> 11:22.307
There's nothing wrong with it.

11:22.390 --> 11:23.808
Thank you, Rebecca.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.185
-Mm-hmm.
-Huh? Hmm?

11:25.268 --> 11:26.603
-It's a little feathery.
-(chuckles)

11:26.686 --> 11:28.021
It's a little feathery.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.981
Ah. Okay. Yeah.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.399
No, I look like Björk.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.400
Okay.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.568
Next dress.
(chuckles)

11:33.651 --> 11:35.445
(chuckling)

11:35.528 --> 11:38.365
-This place is so cute.
-Yeah.

11:38.448 --> 11:39.824
Thank you for inviting me.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.201
Isn't it great?

11:41.284 --> 11:43.203
I brought Kate here to shop
for her wedding gown.

11:43.286 --> 11:44.371
Oh.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.956
-I loved that dress.
-Yeah.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.210
I wish I could have been here
with the two of you, but...

11:51.795 --> 11:54.714
You're here now.
You're here now.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.552
(gasps)
Oh, how's work?

11:59.636 --> 12:00.637
Are you settling in?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.807
Mom, it has been incredible.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.975
It's so rewarding working with these kids.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.435
And then I get so excited just imagining

12:07.519 --> 12:09.145
that that's gonna be Jack one day, and...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.564
-Mm.
-Oh, there was this girl who...
she was having trouble

12:11.648 --> 12:13.441
with a song and I...

12:13.525 --> 12:14.693
I'm word vomiting.

12:14.776 --> 12:17.112
-No.
-Yeah, I am. I'm sorry.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.698
I just realized I haven't been
able to share this with anyone.

12:19.781 --> 12:23.368
You know? With Toby being out of work,
he's hurting. And...

12:23.451 --> 12:25.620
gushing about my job, it just...
I don't know,

12:25.704 --> 12:26.871
just doesn't feel right.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.458
Yeah.
Well, this is new for both of you.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.794
And it's hard.
(inhales)

12:32.877 --> 12:36.464
But I see the way that Toby
lights up when you're happy.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.758
And I know that look.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.511
'Cause I remember feeling such...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.430
relief

12:43.513 --> 12:45.348
seeing your joy when you were younger.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.351
Okay.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.354
What do we think about...

12:51.438 --> 12:52.772
this one?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.274
Huh?

12:54.357 --> 12:55.984
Oh.

12:57.068 --> 12:58.570
Um...

12:58.653 --> 12:59.946
(clanging)

13:00.030 --> 13:01.865
So, is the plan

13:01.948 --> 13:03.825
just to destroy the house
so the leak feels

13:03.908 --> 13:04.993
like less of a problem?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.328
Uh, the plan,

13:07.412 --> 13:10.331
my frequently grumpy,
sometimes funny neighbor,

13:10.415 --> 13:13.251
is to get this all taken care of
by the time Kate gets home.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.629
Which is not looking likely, so...

13:16.713 --> 13:18.840
I'd offer to help,
but I've still only got limited control

13:18.923 --> 13:20.675
of my left hand,
so I'm about as useful as this guy.

13:20.759 --> 13:21.676
Yeah.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.011
Thanks for...

13:23.094 --> 13:25.847
keeping an eye on him
while I work on this.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.807
-Hey, buddy. (chuckles)
-It's no problem.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.642
But I don't know anything about plumbing.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.436
Is there anybody else you can call?

13:31.519 --> 13:33.772
I mean, I could call
my father-in-law, Miguel.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.191
He made his bones in construction.

13:36.274 --> 13:39.110
But, in my experience,
that would send up the...

13:39.194 --> 13:40.612
Pearson Bat-Signal,

13:40.695 --> 13:42.864
and I don't really have
the bandwidth today

13:42.947 --> 13:44.783
to sit around talking about my feelings,

13:44.866 --> 13:46.618
then crying about my feelings,

13:46.701 --> 13:50.080
then talking about crying
about my feelings.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.498
(sighs): Okay.

13:51.581 --> 13:54.876
Desperate times call for...

13:54.959 --> 13:56.378

13:56.461 --> 13:58.213

13:58.296 --> 14:00.090

14:07.305 --> 14:09.808
Um, I've got a bit of a plumbing issue,

14:09.891 --> 14:12.143
and I was hoping you could
impart some fatherly wisdom.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.895
I have a massive leak, and, uh...

14:13.978 --> 14:15.230
Did you call a plumber?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.940
No, I don't want to call a plumber.

14:17.023 --> 14:18.483
I want to fix this leak.
(sighs)

14:18.566 --> 14:20.485
Plumbers cost money.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.197
Money we don't have
since I... lost my job.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.117
Why did you lose your job?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.118
Did you go off your meds?

14:31.371 --> 14:32.831

14:32.914 --> 14:35.083
why I never list you
as my emergency contact.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.898

-To save my career.

20:18.426 --> 20:20.762
-No, you're not.
-No, you're not.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.139
(clicks tongue)
Oh, sweetheart.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.474
I'm sorry.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.892
I don't want to cry
in front of you, Rebecca.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.394
(scoffs)

20:27.477 --> 20:30.313
Oh, crap.
I think I snotted on Meghan.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.315
I already named the dress Meghan Markle,

20:32.399 --> 20:33.650
'cause I felt like a princess.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.527
(cries)
Let's be honest,

20:35.610 --> 20:36.736
I'm a Pippa at best.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.613
REBECCA:
Hey, sweetheart. Stop it.

20:38.697 --> 20:40.031
-Stop it.
-(sniffles)

20:40.115 --> 20:44.869
Do you know how incredibly
special my son is to me?

20:44.953 --> 20:47.163
Do you think I would let him
marry you if you weren't

20:47.247 --> 20:49.499
also incredibly special?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.251
-You're kind, Rebecca.
-No.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.919
Not when it comes to my son.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.672
<i>You</i> are kind.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.424
And you're beautiful

20:57.507 --> 20:58.675
and funny

20:58.758 --> 21:01.845
and remarkably graceful,

21:01.928 --> 21:04.264
even in ridiculous feather dresses.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.390
(laughs)

21:06.474 --> 21:09.436
And we're all crazy about you.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.732
(Madison sniffles)

21:13.815 --> 21:17.444
-And your dad sounds like
a bit of a jackass.
-(all laugh)

21:19.112 --> 21:21.740
JAMES:
All right, uh, this is

21:21.823 --> 21:23.074
<i>Paging Mr. Dad.</i>

21:23.158 --> 21:24.576
You play a single father...

21:24.659 --> 21:26.202
No, I can't do it.
No babies.

21:26.286 --> 21:28.788
No shirtless bottle feeding.
I can't do that anymore.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.540
Okay, now this one...

21:30.623 --> 21:33.585
-No. Yeah, no. (clears throat)
-Oh, my God,

21:33.668 --> 21:36.421
does the town already know
that the movie sucks?

21:37.505 --> 21:39.632
Uh, well, not the whole town.

21:39.716 --> 21:41.718
But also it's...

21:44.512 --> 21:45.930
Your reputation.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.433
You did walk off the set
of your last film.

21:49.851 --> 21:52.479
To be there for the birth of my twins.

21:52.562 --> 21:55.106
And you also walked off a Broadway play.

21:55.190 --> 21:56.983
My brother was having
a nervous breakdown at the time,

21:57.067 --> 21:58.443
and-and it was an off-Broadway play.

21:58.526 --> 22:02.405
And there was a very public
walk-off of a hit sitcom.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.990
(sighs)

22:04.991 --> 22:06.576
Wait.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.245
What do I got to do?
I have to go back to television?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.331
Is that what you're saying?

22:12.749 --> 22:14.918
Why don't they make shows
like <i>Bonanza</i> anymore?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.462
Excuse me?

22:17.545 --> 22:19.673
<i>Bonanza.</i>
You know, Lorne Greene?

22:19.756 --> 22:21.758
That was a man's man.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.344
<i>KEVIN:</i>
<i>Listen, I'm sorry</i>

22:24.427 --> 22:26.262
that we didn't get to go
on that studio tour.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.681
I know you were looking forward to it.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.058
Oh, that's all right.
I got my work cut out for me.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.685
-You gonna read all this crap?
-Yeah.

22:31.768 --> 22:33.311
One of them is based on a Clancy novel.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.939
Yeah, well, I think they
already made that one twice.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.440
-Well, I'll see it again.
-WOMAN: Tim's finishing up

22:37.524 --> 22:39.192
another call, and should be ready soon.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.695
-Sorry, Ms. Baker.
<i>-I can wait.</i>

22:43.113 --> 22:44.114
Uh...

22:44.197 --> 22:45.990
Uncle Nicky, hold-hold on one second.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.159
I'll-I'll... I'll meet you
in the lobby, okay?

22:48.243 --> 22:49.411
Okay.

22:52.455 --> 22:53.707

22:57.168 --> 22:59.421
Uh, well, I just had a meeting

23:08.138 --> 23:10.306

REBECCA:
Mm.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.296
You know, you're a really good mom.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.964
Oh.

23:43.048 --> 23:45.216
Well, I've had a lot of practice.

23:45.300 --> 23:46.676
Yeah, but, um...

23:46.760 --> 23:49.179
I was not an easy daughter.

23:49.262 --> 23:52.265
And I know I pushed you away a lot.

23:52.349 --> 23:54.642
Thanks for loving me anyway.

23:59.230 --> 24:02.859
I remember taking the three of you home
like it was yesterday.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.946
And then I blinked and you were toddlers,

24:07.030 --> 24:09.657
running me and your dad ragged.

24:09.741 --> 24:11.326
And then...

24:11.409 --> 24:13.203
I blinked again and you were teenagers

24:13.286 --> 24:15.789
who wanted nothing to do with us.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.792
And then I blinked again and, mm...

24:21.169 --> 24:25.256
When I look at you, I see all of you.

24:25.340 --> 24:27.592
I see every Kate you've ever been,

24:27.676 --> 24:29.594
(chuckles): every Kate you...

24:29.678 --> 24:31.971
you might still be.

24:33.348 --> 24:35.934
Yeah, you might not have been
an easy daughter all the time,

24:36.017 --> 24:40.146
but you've always,
always been easy to love.

24:41.439 --> 24:42.816
Oh, okay.

24:42.899 --> 24:44.526
Oosh, um...

24:44.609 --> 24:46.444
now who's crying?

24:46.528 --> 24:48.238
Okay.
(chuckles)

24:48.321 --> 24:50.657
(sniffles)
You know what, Mom, there's, um...

24:50.740 --> 24:53.910
there's a place I want
to take you to after this.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.497
-Okay.
-Okay.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.251
So, this is definitely the dress, right?

25:01.334 --> 25:04.045
-Definitely.
-Oh. I love it.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.672
Yeah.
(chuckles)

25:07.215 --> 25:08.550
Yeah.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.136
My, um...

25:11.219 --> 25:14.514
mom walked out on us when I was eight,

25:14.597 --> 25:17.684
and she left me with him,

25:17.767 --> 25:20.645
which was like leaving me with, well...

25:20.729 --> 25:22.105
no one.

25:24.816 --> 25:27.902
Thank you for making me finally
feel like part of a family.

25:31.823 --> 25:34.367
Oh, my God.
It has pockets.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.916
Dej, where's Beth?

25:42.000 --> 25:43.460
She stopped texting me back.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.545
She specifically told me not to tell you.

25:45.628 --> 25:47.172
(groans): Oh, boy.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.886
-Dej, I need y...
-Do you know Malik showed me

25:52.969 --> 25:55.555
a video of Janelle...
(exhales)

25:55.638 --> 25:57.807
calling Jennifer "Mama"?

25:59.851 --> 26:01.895
She's driving from Boston

26:01.978 --> 26:04.606
every weekend, five hours each way.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.066
It's not sustainable.

26:06.149 --> 26:09.235
And Malik knows it's stressing me out.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.820
He knows it.

26:10.904 --> 26:14.491
But he also knows
not to push me to talk about it

26:14.574 --> 26:16.159
till I'm ready.

26:17.243 --> 26:19.162
That's a wise man.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.373
Wiser than me.
Where's my wife?

26:21.456 --> 26:25.377
-You promise not to try and fix things?
-Nope, can't promise that.

26:25.460 --> 26:29.214
Now roll your eyes
and tell me where she is.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.007

26:31.091 --> 26:36.179
She's at the studio cleaning up
to turn over the keys.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.305
Thank you.

26:37.389 --> 26:41.434
Beth doesn't need a hero, Randall.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.604
Just be there for her.

26:46.064 --> 26:49.275
You know?
It's kind of your best quality.

26:54.698 --> 26:57.409
(keys jingle)

26:57.492 --> 27:00.704
I can't even pick your best quality, Dej.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.871
There's too many.

27:01.955 --> 27:03.123
Go.

27:03.206 --> 27:04.374
Going.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.632
Hey, Dad.
You didn't have to come.

27:12.716 --> 27:14.217
We could've just done this over FaceTime.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.344
I hate that crap.

27:16.428 --> 27:18.304
I'm vaccinated.
You're vaccinated.

I was at that company for ten years, Pop,

Messed me up good.

30:54.229 --> 30:58.608
Spent half a year pretending
it hadn't happened.

31:06.783 --> 31:09.661
It's nice your in-laws talk about stuff

31:09.744 --> 31:11.705
that's bothering them.

31:11.788 --> 31:14.124
I wish I'd done more of that.

31:15.709 --> 31:19.587
You, uh, keep your eye on this.

31:19.671 --> 31:22.382
People only look for leaks

Kate, I just got off the phone
with Olivia,

31:56.249 --> 31:59.544

to the interview. What happened?

31:59.627 --> 32:02.380
Nothing.
I just...

32:02.464 --> 32:04.382
I couldn't really see myself being happy

32:04.466 --> 32:05.884
in an office, you know?

32:05.967 --> 32:08.678
Kate... you need a job.

32:08.762 --> 32:11.514

-Mm-hmm.
