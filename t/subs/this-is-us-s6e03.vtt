I know we're all excited--

08:51.865 --> 08:53.199
Come here, Kev, come on--
I know we're all excited,

08:53.283 --> 08:54.951
but we're just gonna have
to wait our turn.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.494
But what if they run
out of candy?

08:56.578 --> 08:57.912
They're not gonna
run out of candy, bud.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.331
So, hey, look, let's just,
let's get some snacks

09:00.415 --> 09:01.875
and then we'll go
find our seats.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.126
-Hi.
-Hey, can I help you?

09:03.209 --> 09:06.129
Yeah, can I get, um,
three little popcorns,

09:06.212 --> 09:09.549
some, uh, ooh, some Raisinets--
three of those.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.718
And, uh, do you have coffee?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.136
Sure do.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.721
-Great, it's been a long week.
-KATE: Daddy?

09:14.804 --> 09:17.474
-Yeah.
-Are you gonna live
at work forever?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.393
Uh, I don't live at work,
Katie girl.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.312
I live with you guys, remember?

09:22.395 --> 09:24.898
My dad worked a lot.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.318
I resented it at first,
but look at me now.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.489
Mm. How much are those?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.740
-CLERK: Eight dollars.
-Eight bucks. Great.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.575
Eight bucks, okay,
there's eight.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
Got the coffee, got the
popcorns-- Here we go, let's go,

09:37.660 --> 09:39.120
let's go, come on, come on,
come on, we eat that inside,

09:39.204 --> 09:40.372
we're gonna eat that inside.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.669
SANDY:
All right,
should we rehearse one?

09:45.752 --> 09:48.338
All right, now, on the day,
we'll have the real twins here--

09:48.421 --> 09:51.466
Lord help us-- but for now
we'll just use the jelly babies.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.052
-Oh...
-Kevin, were those babies this
creepy when you were the Manny?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.846
(chuckles)
Well, um,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.765
you know, their eyes
were somehow even deader

09:58.848 --> 10:00.725
and they always smelled
like roast beef, so yeah.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.353
-(laughs)
-SANDY: Okay, gang,
um, why don't we

10:03.436 --> 10:04.604
pick it up from the toast?

10:04.688 --> 10:06.272
Taking it from the toast.

10:06.356 --> 10:07.691
Um, okay, that's me.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.568
-"Today was a good day."
-And action.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.112
-Thank you.
-Yes.

10:12.195 --> 10:13.530
Today was a good day.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.950
Um, I'm lucky to have
all of you in my life.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.161
My beautiful wife,
my amazing stepdaughter.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.330
-Can I get my nose pierced?
-Not a chance.

10:22.414 --> 10:28.086
My cute little babies
who are the twinkle in my eye.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.379
And you.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.925
Gang, it's-it's moments
like this, right?

10:34.009 --> 10:36.344
Just being together,
enjoying each other.

10:36.428 --> 10:37.554
Nothing else matters.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.432
You're my world. My life.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.726
You make me whole.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.732
(Sandy clears throat)

10:48.815 --> 10:52.152
Sorry. Yeah, um...
Sorry about that.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.029
"With you, I feel like
I can do anything."

10:54.112 --> 10:57.115
And then I say,
"Drink up, little man."

10:57.198 --> 10:59.034
And hopefully baby Archie
will cheers,

10:59.117 --> 11:01.494
knocking over his milk,
cuing the Manny to say...

11:01.578 --> 11:03.663
I got that.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.248
(grunts)

11:05.331 --> 11:07.334
That's why I always bring
an extra muscle tee to work.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.878
You never know with this guy.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.421
SANDY:
Laugh, laugh, laugh,

11:11.504 --> 11:13.089
and cut. Great.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.341
Let's move over
to the living room

11:14.424 --> 11:16.343
and we'll rehearse scene 12.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.762
(Tyler exhales)

11:18.845 --> 11:21.514
I think that's gonna be
a really nice moment.

11:21.598 --> 11:24.517
Oh. Uh, well, th--
Yeah, thanks. Hope so.

11:24.601 --> 11:25.810
Hope so.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.146
You okay?

11:28.229 --> 11:30.148
Yeah, it's-- You know,
I just, I feel weird

11:30.231 --> 11:31.775
saying all that stuff
to these dolls, you know?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.401
I-I...

11:33.485 --> 11:36.237
I didn't get to spent any time
with my kids today.

11:36.321 --> 11:40.617
Hey, um, some of us
are going out after rehearsal.

11:40.700 --> 11:41.910
You should come.

11:47.791 --> 11:52.754
Okay, there's four sides:
one, two, three.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.881
-Good job.
-Okay, it's gift time.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.676
(whispers):
Babe, I just put Hailey down.

11:57.759 --> 12:01.638
(whispers):
Okay, it's gift time.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.847
(chuckles)

12:02.931 --> 12:04.265
You want to see what I got
for little Jack?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.309
-Yeah.
-Okay, check this out.

12:06.393 --> 12:09.437
It is a beeping football.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.398
-You turn it on,
and it makes a sound.
-(beeping)

12:11.481 --> 12:13.358
We can roll it back and forth
to each other

12:13.441 --> 12:14.818
and get our Eli Manning on.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.029
I picked Eli because he's
the cutest Manning, obviously.

12:18.113 --> 12:20.490
Listen, this is gonna
wind him up,

12:20.573 --> 12:22.200
and he has to go down
for his nap before 3:00,

12:22.283 --> 12:24.077
especially if a sitter's
coming tonight.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.787
But you can play, you know,
when he gets up, okay?

12:25.870 --> 12:29.290
-Yeah. Yeah.
-And you really don't
have to come

12:29.374 --> 12:33.211
-bearing gifts every time.
-Okay, all right.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.464
I guess, uh, I guess you don't
want your present, then?

12:36.548 --> 12:38.925
-Oh, no, I want my present.
-Oh, you--

12:39.009 --> 12:40.635
-Oh, you do. Okay, okay.
-I do. I didn't know
I was getting one.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.013
Um, I know how
you're always so annoyed

12:43.096 --> 12:44.472
about losing the remote control.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.891
So I picked this up in Chinatown

12:46.975 --> 12:48.727
so you'll always know
where it is.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.604
Oh. That's sweet.

12:51.688 --> 12:54.733
It's beautiful. Thank you.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.026
And I've always wanted.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.778
(laughs)
Open it.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.113
Okay.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.324
Babe.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.326
(laughs):
What?

13:05.410 --> 13:07.495
Oh...

13:07.579 --> 13:09.497
-Um...
-Open the purse.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.292
The purse is for you
to carry tonight.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.794
And the gift card is for you
to get your hair blown up.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.796
-(laughs) Blown...
-Blown-blown down.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.965
(chuckles)
Uh, blown out.

13:19.049 --> 13:21.509
While I watch the kids.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.970
My Zoom call got canceled,
so you go do you.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.513
Go get your hair done.

13:25.597 --> 13:26.931
Go get
your hair done.

13:27.015 --> 13:28.558
-KATE: Okay.
-TOBY: Yeah, listen to the man.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.770
-JACK: Okay.
-Okay, I'll see you boys soon.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.646
-Thanks, babe.
-TOBY: Oh, you got it.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.232
-You got it.
-TOBY: Yeah.
Say, "Bye-bye, Mama."

13:36.316 --> 13:37.567
Bye-bye, Mama.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.861
KATE:
Bye, Sweet Pea.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.155
Oh, babe, do you need me
to go over the schedules?

13:42.238 --> 13:43.406
'Cause they change constantly.

13:43.490 --> 13:44.908
And he has to be down
for his nap by 3:00.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.494
Kate, they're my kids, too.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.454
All right? And I think,
if you'll recall,

13:49.537 --> 13:51.247
I was a pretty good
stay-at-home dad myself there

13:51.331 --> 13:52.457
for a while.

13:52.540 --> 13:53.875
So I think I can watch them
for an hour.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.670
Okay.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.380
Thanks, babe.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.422
-Love you.
-Love you, too.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.674
-Thank you.
-Say, "I love you, Mama."

14:00.757 --> 14:02.634
-KATE: Bye, boys.
-JACK: Love you.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.010
<i>RANDALL:</i>
<i>Okay, Deja.</i>

14:04.094 --> 14:07.180
Welcome to the Randall Pearson
School of Driving.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.015
I'll be your instructor
Randall Pearson.

14:09.099 --> 14:10.850
Allow me to put on
some background music

14:10.934 --> 14:12.435
as I talk you through
some of the safety features

14:12.519 --> 14:13.645
of the vehicle.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.522
Okay, I can't do this

14:15.605 --> 14:17.148
if we're gonna listen
to your old man music.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.317
Oh! "Old man music"?

14:19.401 --> 14:21.486
That... that's hurtful.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.489
-Mm-hmm. To my ears.
-(laughs)

14:24.572 --> 14:25.949
("Standing at Your Doorstep"
by Alicia Walter playing)

14:26.032 --> 14:27.575
It's good speed.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.827
Make sure you keep that distance

14:28.910 --> 14:30.161
between you and the car
in front of you.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.498
-Got it. Thanks.
-You're doing great, Dej.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.919
Glad we finally found time
to do this.

14:38.003 --> 14:41.256
Haven't had a lot of time
to talk lately.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.174
So, how's school going?

14:43.258 --> 14:45.010
Uh, fine.

14:45.093 --> 14:47.595
-You know Ms. McNamara?
-Your chemistry teacher?

14:47.679 --> 14:48.805
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.640
Well, she's getting
into stand-up comedy.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.684
(laughs):
Okay.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.271
And she tries out
her jokes on us.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.398
-But, like, bad ones.
-Mm-hmm.

14:58.481 --> 15:03.069
Um, like, "Why can you never
trust atoms?"

15:03.153 --> 15:05.739
Because they make up everything.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.616
(laughs)

15:08.700 --> 15:11.202
You are worse than Ms. McNamara.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.121
Oh, man.

15:13.204 --> 15:15.373
All right, look,
we're about to merge.

15:15.457 --> 15:19.502
-So, uh, put on your signal...
-(both chuckle)

15:19.586 --> 15:21.463

15:54.287 --> 15:55.455
She took a six-hour bus ride
four states away,

15:55.538 --> 15:57.040
and we had no idea.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.416
-What if something happened?
-Let's kill her.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.876
Let's dig a hole in the backyard
and bury her in it.

15:59.959 --> 16:03.338
And it's not just how dangerous
it could have been, Beth.

16:03.421 --> 16:05.215
It's the lying.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.093
And it wasn't just one lie,
she lied right to our faces.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.969
Right to our faces.

16:10.053 --> 16:12.138
Okay, hold up.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.348
I feel like we need to pick

16:13.431 --> 16:15.141
which one of us
is gonna unravel here

16:15.225 --> 16:16.226
and which one of us
is gonna stay cool.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.478
I'm already pacing, Beth.
I'm up.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.397
Okay, fine, I'll stay cool.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.565
She is grounded.

16:22.649 --> 16:23.817
Phone, gone.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.402
Food, maybe.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.737
And she is forbidden
from seeing Malik for forever.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.030
Can we put her back
on Zoom school?

16:29.114 --> 16:30.573
I feel like that's kind of
punishing ourselves,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.617
-so I want to hold off...
-We need to make an example

16:32.701 --> 16:34.452
of her Tess and for Annie.

16:34.536 --> 16:37.288
Maybe we should ground them all
just to get ahead of it.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.583
Randall, you're so hot,
I'm gonna need an ice bath.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.460
So why don't I go talk to her?

16:42.544 --> 16:45.130
Why, Beth?
So she can lie some more?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.090
Huh? Huh-- You know what?
I'm too hot.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.675
I'm too hot ri--
I-I'm-a go for a run.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.593

like, 17 years old?

17:50.904 --> 17:53.782
-I'm 25. I just look young.
-Okay.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.951

-Well. That's great.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.870
I was thinking that,
maybe after this,

17:58.953 --> 18:00.663

White Sea at The Echo.

27:55.383 --> 27:58.803
And Kate had to pee,
but there was no bathroom,

27:58.887 --> 28:00.138
and Kevin and Randall

28:00.221 --> 28:02.015
were fighting over
the last Capri Sun.

28:02.098 --> 28:03.183
It was a mess.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.392
We got to the car

28:04.476 --> 28:06.644
and everybody was crying,
myself included.

28:06.728 --> 28:12.233
And just when I thought
it was the worst day ever, um,

28:12.317 --> 28:15.195
a ladybug landed
on the dashboard.

28:15.278 --> 28:17.364
-(laughs softly)
-And Kevin tells us

28:17.447 --> 28:19.407
it's good luck.

28:19.491 --> 28:22.952
And Randall says that ladybugs
have two sets of wings.

28:23.036 --> 28:27.582
And Kate decided to name it.

28:27.665 --> 28:30.168
-Linda.
-Linda the Ladybug.

28:30.251 --> 28:33.046
So, when I was
tucking them in last night,

28:33.129 --> 28:35.840
that's what they remember
from the day.

28:35.924 --> 28:40.887
Not the crying, not the Capri
Suns, but Linda the Ladybug.

28:42.514 --> 28:45.308
Until a day is over,
there's always a chance

28:45.392 --> 28:47.727
you'll remember it
for something else.

28:59.280 --> 29:00.615
(door opens)

29:00.699 --> 29:04.160
(exhales)

29:04.244 --> 29:05.912
All right, Beth.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.122
-Here's what we're gonna do.
-We're not gonna be able

29:07.205 --> 29:09.916
to ground this
out of her, Randall.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.376
That girl is completely in love.

29:11.459 --> 29:13.128
Doesn't give her an excuse.

29:13.211 --> 29:15.213
It's like how you and I felt
at the beginning.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.465
If somebody would have told us
we couldn't see each other

29:17.549 --> 29:18.800
for months,
we would have found a way.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.010
So what are you saying, Beth?

29:20.093 --> 29:21.386
That, because she's in love,

29:21.469 --> 29:22.429
there shouldn't be
any consequences?

29:22.512 --> 29:24.222
Oh, no, there's gonna
be consequences.

29:24.305 --> 29:25.640
Like, she's not gonna
see this again

29:25.724 --> 29:27.058
until they come out
with the iPhone 30.

29:27.142 --> 29:29.019
-Okay.
-But...

29:29.102 --> 29:32.647
this isn't just about
what happened last weekend.

29:32.731 --> 29:35.191
This is...

29:35.275 --> 29:37.318
We thought our daughter
was a child,

29:37.402 --> 29:39.738
playing Candy Land,

29:39.821 --> 29:42.699
but she's out here playing
The Game of Life,

29:42.782 --> 29:44.743
and we have to adjust.

29:51.249 --> 29:53.001
Randall, take a big sip
of my wine.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.210
I don't want a big sip
of your wine.

29:54.294 --> 29:56.504
-I just ran for five miles.
-Drink the wine.

30:00.759 --> 30:03.219
I'm taking Deja
to get birth control.

30:18.651 --> 30:20.862
(whispers):
Hey.

30:20.945 --> 30:25.325
I was trying to sneak in
undetected in case, you know,

30:25.408 --> 30:27.577
"grown-up time"
was still going on.

30:27.660 --> 30:30.455
Which is-is kind of "gross,"
you know, I keep saying "it"

30:30.538 --> 30:33.541
because you're married
to my "sister."

30:33.625 --> 30:36.753
-Why are you doing that?
-I-- You know,
I-I'm so tired, man,

30:36.836 --> 30:38.838
I-I don't even--
I can't, you know...

30:38.922 --> 30:41.091
Well, you don't have
to worry about it,

30:41.174 --> 30:44.135
'cause grown-up time was a bust.

30:44.219 --> 30:46.554
Kate went to the recital
all by herself.

30:46.638 --> 30:49.724
I literally just got both kids
down for the night.

30:49.808 --> 30:51.643
Which, it turns out, is a
nightmare when the nap schedule

30:51.726 --> 30:53.645
-is all out of whack.
-Ooh, yeah,

30:53.728 --> 30:55.480
no, you don't want to mess
with the nap schedule.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.731
So I hear.

30:58.316 --> 31:01.194
What's all this? You, uh,
you taking off tomorrow?

31:01.277 --> 31:03.613
TOBY:
Yep. Bright and early,

31:03.697 --> 31:09.077
so I can make it in time
for the 9:00 a.m. staff meeting.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.537
Yeah, at least you have
an excuse, you know?

31:10.620 --> 31:13.832
I live in the same city
as my kids, I feel like a...

31:13.915 --> 31:15.959
a stranger, so...

31:17.794 --> 31:21.423
You know, when I first found out
I was gonna be a dad,

31:21.506 --> 31:25.343
I kept trying to picture it,
you know, in my head.

31:25.427 --> 31:30.849
And the image that kept popping
into my mind was, uh,

31:30.932 --> 31:33.184
family dinner, dinner table,
you know?

31:33.268 --> 31:36.062
Mom, dad, couple of kids.

31:38.606 --> 31:41.109
This was gonna be us.

31:41.192 --> 31:43.695
Me, Madison, the two kids.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.906
Square, you know?
A solid... unit.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.117
Well, for what it's worth,
that dinner table

31:49.200 --> 31:50.952
isn't all it's cracked up to be.

31:51.036 --> 31:53.288
I sat through plenty of dinners
with my parents,

31:53.371 --> 31:54.956
who clearly couldn't
stand each other.

31:55.040 --> 32:00.295
I think kids would much rather
have parents that are happy

32:00.378 --> 32:01.755
than parents who are together.

32:01.838 --> 32:06.718
Yeah, but I'm not happy.

32:09.721 --> 32:14.893
You know, it's funny,
when... when we're kids,

32:14.976 --> 32:20.565
we always, we build houses
that are, uh, square,

32:20.648 --> 32:23.860
because we think...

32:23.943 --> 32:27.364
that that is the strongest shape
that there is.

32:28.782 --> 32:31.451
But, turns out...

32:36.122 --> 32:39.793
...a triangle is the strongest
shape in nature.

32:39.876 --> 32:41.503
Strong base.

32:41.586 --> 32:45.215
It's capable of holding
infinitely more weight...

32:47.175 --> 32:51.680
It is the most stable shape
that there is.

32:57.185 --> 32:58.186
See?

32:59.562 --> 33:01.690
So maybe you should just stop
thinking of your family

33:01.773 --> 33:05.735
as a square and start
thinking of it as, you know,

33:05.819 --> 33:10.240
you, Nick, Franny.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.200
A triangle.

33:14.994 --> 33:16.454
The hell are you talking about
right now, man?

33:16.538 --> 33:18.832
(laughs)

33:18.915 --> 33:21.710
I don't, I don't know.
I have no idea.

33:21.793 --> 33:23.503

sex with your sister tonight.

34:40.622 --> 34:44.125
don't make me have
this conversation with you.

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
You know, today,
when I saw you behind the wheel

34:49.214 --> 34:51.091
of that car, I thought...

34:53.301 --> 34:56.221
"She looks ridiculous.

34:56.304 --> 34:58.390
She's way too young
to be driving."

35:00.975 --> 35:04.813
Because, to me...

35:08.817 --> 35:11.027
...you look exactly
like the little girl

35:11.111 --> 35:13.822
who came to my doorstep
with everything she had

35:13.905 --> 35:17.575
in the world
tucked into one bag.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.414
Now, rationally, of course,

35:22.497 --> 35:26.167
I knew that this little girl had
already grown up quite a bit.

35:26.251 --> 35:30.964
And I knew that the rest of
the growing up was still coming.

35:31.047 --> 35:33.591
I just didn't realize
that it would come so quickly.

35:36.011 --> 35:39.514
And maybe that's why I'm having
a hard time with this.

35:42.559 --> 35:45.353
'Cause I missed the first
12 years of your life,

35:45.437 --> 35:50.066
