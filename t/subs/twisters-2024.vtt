Jeb, are you sure
you're recording?

about to chase a storm
southwest of us.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.945
Our experiment is designed
to decrease the moisture

02:33.081 --> 02:35.087
inside of a tornado to see
if we can make it collapse.

02:35.222 --> 02:37.012
Tell the folks
how you do that, Kate.

02:37.148 --> 02:38.919
Well, first, we got
to find a tornado

02:39.054 --> 02:40.857
to suck up our superabsorbent
polymers in these barrels...

02:40.993 --> 02:42.691

they use in diapers. Hmm.

- [Addy] It's nontoxic.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.290

02:48.426 --> 02:50.798
Uh, the Doppler doesn't show
a storm until the afternoon.

02:50.934 --> 02:52.601
[Addy] The data doesn't see
what Kate sees, remember?

02:52.736 --> 02:54.969
How about Kate sees
a few more hours of sleep?

02:55.104 --> 02:56.369
That might work.

Shit, you wouldn't believe it.
I joined the military.

- Yeah.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.248

kind of lost.

16:27.978 --> 16:30.318
I tried reaching out to you
a few times.

16:30.453 --> 16:33.517
Yeah, I'm not great
with communication.

16:33.652 --> 16:34.987

I figured.

16:35.123 --> 16:37.028
You know, life and all.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.656
But I hadn't heard from you,
so, you know,

16:38.791 --> 16:40.461
I stopped by your mom's
in Sapulpa to check in.

16:40.596 --> 16:42.924
She said... she said
you don't come home anymore.

16:44.302 --> 16:46.694
I knew you moved,
but I didn't expect you

16:46.830 --> 16:48.499
to move somewhere
like New York.

16:48.634 --> 16:50.705
New York's great.

17:08.325 --> 17:09.885

so powerful and so fast,

17:10.020 --> 17:13.159
I could watch a moth fly
from, like, a mile away.

17:13.294 --> 17:15.429
But I kept asking myself...

17:15.564 --> 17:18.201
What if we point this thing
at a tornado?

17:18.336 --> 17:20.203
Well, Javi,
it's the size of a building.

17:20.338 --> 17:21.802
You'd never be able
to get it close enough.

17:21.937 --> 17:23.206
Until now.

17:24.904 --> 17:27.039
The military, they came up
with portable units,

17:27.174 --> 17:28.671
and they're small.

17:28.807 --> 17:30.609
I got my hands
on a few prototypes.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.655
Yo, my man, can...
can I borrow this real quick?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.181

17:54.736 --> 17:57.141

high-resolution images,

17:57.276 --> 17:58.703

kind of flat.

17:59.569 --> 18:01.078
So what do we do?

18:01.213 --> 18:04.610
My team sets up two more,
here and here.

18:05.717 --> 18:06.717
Now we have a...

18:06.853 --> 18:08.218
A three-dimensional scan.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.947

of a tornado ever.

18:11.082 --> 18:14.620
Kate, we can use this data
to save lives back home.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.888
- I mean, this is incredible.
- I know.

18:20.024 --> 18:21.362

that can get me

18:21.498 --> 18:23.134

to do this.

18:27.101 --> 18:28.768

18:28.903 --> 18:31.006
- No, I...

I was giving her a bath--

01:17:03.378 --> 01:17:04.984
- Can we not?
- Maybe just a little.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:08.519
And we heard thunder,
and she shot up out of the tub

01:17:08.654 --> 01:17:10.419
and ran out the house

01:17:10.554 --> 01:17:12.255
- naked as the day
she was born...
- [Kate] Oh, my God.

01:17:12.391 --> 01:17:13.621
- ...and I had no idea
where she w--
- [laughing]

01:17:13.756 --> 01:17:15.090
I was terrified.

01:17:15.226 --> 01:17:17.523
And when I finally
caught up with her,

01:17:17.659 --> 01:17:20.030
she was standing in
the middle of the wheat field,

01:17:21.304 --> 01:17:23.001
staring at the sky.

01:17:23.136 --> 01:17:25.234
- I got to try that out.
- Will you stop encouraging her?

01:17:25.369 --> 01:17:27.169
Keep your clothes on, Kate.
Let your mom finish.

01:17:27.305 --> 01:17:29.974
All I'm saying is,
she always loved weather.

01:17:31.572 --> 01:17:33.340
Worse the weather,
the happier the girl.

01:17:36.647 --> 01:17:37.981
What about you?

01:17:38.117 --> 01:17:39.511
Tyler, how'd you come
to do this work?

01:17:42.316 --> 01:17:43.989
Well, when you love something,

01:17:44.124 --> 01:17:45.517
you'll spend your whole life
trying to understand it.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:49.987
Katie was studying for a PhD.

01:17:50.122 --> 01:17:52.096
[Tyler] Wow.

01:17:52.231 --> 01:17:54.191
I keep telling her
to come back and finish it.

01:17:54.326 --> 01:17:55.869
Okay, Mom. [chuckles]

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:57.503
She was heading up a big study
with her friends:

01:17:57.638 --> 01:18:00.166
disrupting tornado dynamics.

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.301
Uh, does anybody need anything?

01:18:02.437 --> 01:18:05.045
Nah, I'm...
I'm good, thank you.

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.927
[Cathy] I invited Tyler to stay
the night in the guest room.

01:18:24.063 --> 01:18:25.425
- [sighs] Mom.
- [dishes clinking]

01:18:29.163 --> 01:18:30.331
[door sliding open]

01:18:34.008 --> 01:18:36.636
You thought
you could disrupt a tornado.

01:18:36.772 --> 01:18:39.645
- Hey, don't look at that.
- Oh, you're the OG Wrangler.

01:18:39.780 --> 01:18:40.810
Tyler, can you give that to me?

01:18:40.946 --> 01:18:42.143
"Using superabsorbent polymers

- Tyler.

01:18:45.146 --> 01:18:46.711
I mean, you'd have to

01:18:46.847 --> 01:18:48.580
drop a silo of it in a funnel
for any real effect.

01:18:48.716 --> 01:18:50.052
Well, yeah, that's why
we were trying to use

01:18:50.188 --> 01:18:52.025
different reagents
to enhance it.

01:18:52.161 --> 01:18:53.718
- It's a dumb idea.
- Yeah, some of
your reactants are off.

01:18:53.853 --> 01:18:54.894
- A few of these

01:18:55.626 --> 01:18:57.158
What?

01:18:57.294 --> 01:18:58.256
You really think
I'm an idiot, don't you?

01:18:58.392 --> 01:18:59.932
No, I don't think you're an--

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:01.860
- Hey, modeling's got
so much better.
- Tyler.

01:19:01.995 --> 01:19:03.361
I can upload this to my laptop,
link up with a supercomputer.

01:19:03.497 --> 01:19:05.137
- No, no...
- I'm telling you,

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:06.697
- we can get
a new model running.
- That's okay.

01:19:06.832 --> 01:19:08.137
- Please, can you stop?
- It's a great idea.

01:19:08.273 --> 01:19:09.067
How did you not tell me
about this before?

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:09.770
Because I got it wrong!

01:19:09.905 --> 01:19:12.446
[panting]

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.307
In the field, in the moment,

01:19:14.442 --> 01:19:17.411
when it mattered,
I got it wrong.

01:19:17.546 --> 01:19:19.319
Okay, I underestimated
what we were up against,

01:19:19.455 --> 01:19:21.078
and I pushed it too far.

01:19:21.214 --> 01:19:22.717
And for what?

01:19:22.853 --> 01:19:24.486
[sobs softly]

01:19:24.622 --> 01:19:26.761
Some childish dream I had
that I could make a difference?

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:29.720
It was never gonna work.

01:19:32.892 --> 01:19:35.902
And I h... I have to live
with that forever.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.271
[sighs]

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:55.283
You know, uh, EF1 or EF5
tornado rating...

01:19:55.418 --> 01:19:57.154
it's not based on size
or wind speed.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:00.124
The power we ascribe to it,

01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:03.921
it's based on damage.

01:20:04.057 --> 01:20:08.264
Now, it's only after the fact
we can really define it.

01:20:08.399 --> 01:20:11.300
What it destroys,
what it takes from us.

01:20:13.499 --> 01:20:15.172
I'm sorry for what happened.

01:20:17.844 --> 01:20:19.275
[sighs] But how much more

01:20:19.410 --> 01:20:20.947
are you gonna let this thing
take from you?

01:20:29.088 --> 01:20:30.182
[sniffles]
You know, you should...

01:20:30.318 --> 01:20:31.782
you should get some sleep.

01:22:14.723 --> 01:22:16.326
You said you could get
a new model running?

01:22:19.259 --> 01:22:20.429
Yes, ma'am.

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.631
So this is an EF1,
perfect conditions.

01:22:26.767 --> 01:22:29.503
Run your experiment,
see if it works.

01:22:29.638 --> 01:22:33.076
Okay, so, um,
1,500 kilos of polymer

01:22:33.211 --> 01:22:35.575
absorbing 300 times its weight.

01:22:35.710 --> 01:22:38.877
[Tyler] So, it's, uh,
450,000 kilos

01:22:39.012 --> 01:22:42.148
of precipitation loaded into
our water-filled polymer

01:22:42.284 --> 01:22:43.982
to load the updraft.

01:22:44.118 --> 01:22:45.752
- Let's see
how the model responds.
- [steady beeping]

01:22:45.887 --> 01:22:47.660
[Kate] Buoyancy of

01:22:47.795 --> 01:22:49.920
[Tyler] It's reducing.

01:22:50.055 --> 01:22:51.460
- Slowing the updraft.
- Temp is going down.

01:22:52.535 --> 01:22:53.396
[Tyler] Kate?

01:22:55.268 --> 01:22:57.070
Kate, in theory,
this should've worked.

01:22:59.772 --> 01:23:00.766
In theory.

01:23:03.406 --> 01:23:04.801
But it wasn't an EF1 that day.

01:23:04.937 --> 01:23:07.509
I mean...
we never had a chance.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:10.644

01:23:24.497 --> 01:23:26.360
Wait, what are you touching

- You got a lot of gadgets.

01:28:10.242 --> 01:28:11.410
I want to help people,
too, Kate.

01:28:11.545 --> 01:28:12.418
I really do.

01:28:13.617 --> 01:28:15.289
I said what I said 'cause I...

01:28:16.919 --> 01:28:18.083
I carry that guilt
with me, too.

01:28:19.988 --> 01:28:21.592
Every single day
of my life, so...

01:28:23.326 --> 01:28:25.297
I'm sorry.

01:28:25.433 --> 01:28:28.699
Javi, why don't you stay
and help us?

01:28:28.834 --> 01:28:30.502
That way, we could
finally solve this together.

01:28:32.633 --> 01:28:33.604
[chuckles softly]

01:28:38.242 --> 01:28:40.545
You know, there was a time when
I'd do anything for you, Kate.

01:28:46.620 --> 01:28:47.981
[Scott] Javi. [taps door]
Let's roll.

01:28:48.116 --> 01:28:49.646
We got a storm developing
up near Enid.

01:28:49.781 --> 01:28:50.816
Team's waiting.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.755
[Javi] I got to get back
to work.

01:28:52.890 --> 01:28:54.955
The more data I get,
the better for business.

01:28:56.931 --> 01:28:57.859
[Kate sighs]

01:29:00.134 --> 01:29:01.434
Sorry I stole your car.

01:29:02.497 --> 01:29:03.469
It's all right.

01:29:04.740 --> 01:29:05.768
Look...

01:29:07.603 --> 01:29:08.705
Be careful out there.

01:29:11.671 --> 01:29:13.677
[engine starts]

01:29:18.282 --> 01:29:20.178
[beeping]

01:29:20.313 --> 01:29:22.148
[Tyler] Wow,
these scans are impressive.

01:29:22.283 --> 01:29:25.083
[Kate] I mean, it's
a complete map of the chaos.

01:29:25.218 --> 01:29:29.026
Tyler, our moisture numbers
are off.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.155
Currently, the polymer
is only absorbing
the existing raindrops,

01:29:32.290 --> 01:29:33.597
not the moisture
from the humidity.

01:29:33.733 --> 01:29:36.663
I mean, we need it
to precipitate out more.

01:29:36.798 --> 01:29:39.033
So we need to make it rain.

01:29:39.168 --> 01:29:41.236
They were cloud seeding
in Lawton a few years ago

01:29:41.371 --> 01:29:42.503
for the farmers.

01:29:42.639 --> 01:29:44.103
Yeah. Yeah, silver iodide.

01:29:45.478 --> 01:29:48.548
We could shoot rockets of that.

01:29:48.684 --> 01:29:52.009
So, the silver iodide converts
the moisture into rain,

01:29:52.144 --> 01:29:53.514
and then
the sodium polyacrylate,

01:29:53.649 --> 01:29:54.881
we need a lot of it...

01:29:55.017 --> 01:29:56.687
would pull the water
from the storm,

01:29:57.654 --> 01:29:59.919
increasing the cold pool.

01:30:00.055 --> 01:30:01.923
No faster way
to choke a tornado.

01:30:02.997 --> 01:30:04.526
Hey, Lily.

01:30:04.661 --> 01:30:06.763
Yeah, I couldn't get Boone.

01:30:06.898 --> 01:30:08.501
No, we're gonna need you guys
for something.

01:30:10.129 --> 01:30:11.728
No, no, no. We'll come to you.

01:30:11.863 --> 01:30:12.901
All right.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:17.103
Is this it?

01:30:17.238 --> 01:30:18.669
Or you gonna come back
before you go home?

01:30:18.804 --> 01:30:19.842
You know I will.

01:30:22.415 --> 01:30:23.945
- Love you.
- Love you.

01:30:25.283 --> 01:30:27.587
This is for you.

01:30:27.722 --> 01:30:29.588
You have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

01:30:30.388 --> 01:30:31.381
I'm beginning to.

01:30:37.856 --> 01:30:39.626
Huh. Thanks.

01:30:39.761 --> 01:30:41.468
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:30:48.071 --> 01:30:49.267
- [truck door closes]
- [chuckles softly]

01:30:52.041 --> 01:30:53.810
- [engine starts]
- [truck door closes]

01:30:58.382 --> 01:30:59.409
Oh, Lord.

01:31:00.617 --> 01:31:01.715
You finally made it.

01:31:01.851 --> 01:31:03.953
[Tyler] Ben, you stuck around.

01:31:04.089 --> 01:31:06.291
Turns out, there's more
to this story than I thought.

01:31:06.426 --> 01:31:07.756
We got a new ending for you.

01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:09.292
[Dexter]
Look who it is. City girl.

01:31:09.428 --> 01:31:10.893
[Lily] What's up, Kate?

01:31:11.029 --> 01:31:12.493
Finally decided to ditch
all those squares, huh?

01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:14.061
[chuckles] Right on.

01:31:14.196 --> 01:31:16.300
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Y'all missed a big one. Look.

01:31:16.436 --> 01:31:18.267
- Oh, wow.
- See?

01:31:18.402 --> 01:31:21.666
Hey, can you, um...
Can you rig that drone
to collect data?

01:31:21.802 --> 01:31:23.400
I can do that.

01:31:23.536 --> 01:31:25.078
- [Dexter] Yeah,
she can do that.
- Easy. Easy.

01:31:25.213 --> 01:31:28.307
Hey, buddy. I'm sorry.

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:30.548
- How do I make it up to you?
- Man, you abandoned me.

01:31:30.684 --> 01:31:32.012
I don't know nothing
about no makeup.

01:31:32.148 --> 01:31:33.883
How about we launch
some new rockets?

01:31:34.019 --> 01:31:36.352
["Already Had It"
by Tucker Wetmore playing]

01:31:36.487 --> 01:31:37.854
You said rockets?

01:31:38.588 --> 01:31:41.521
Hey. Y'all ready?

01:31:41.657 --> 01:31:43.853
We need a 40-foot trailer
that's light enough
for a pickup

01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:47.994
but heavy enough
to anchor barrels
in 100-mile-an-hour winds.

01:31:48.130 --> 01:31:49.503
Why the hell
would you want that?

01:31:53.166 --> 01:31:54.639
Why the hell do we want that?

01:31:54.775 --> 01:31:56.299
Well, 'cause when we drive
into a tornado,

01:31:56.435 --> 01:31:57.674
we want whatever's
on the trailer

01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:59.172
to get sucked into it,
but not us.

01:32:01.008 --> 01:32:02.376
You're gonna want aluminum.

01:32:02.511 --> 01:32:03.440
Okay.

01:32:05.983 --> 01:32:08.379
Dexter, talk to me.
What's going on?

01:32:08.515 --> 01:32:10.949
Testing
the Goldilocks principle
of a tornado

01:32:11.084 --> 01:32:12.491
by modifying the variables,

01:32:12.627 --> 01:32:14.127
hopefully disrupting
the process.

01:32:14.262 --> 01:32:15.392
[Boone] Mm-hmm. Okay.

01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:17.054
Dani, what does that mean?

01:32:17.190 --> 01:32:18.862
- Taming the storm.
- Right.

01:32:21.094 --> 01:32:22.392
T, tell us what's going on.

01:32:22.528 --> 01:32:23.962
All right,
we're gonna shoot the clouds

01:32:24.098 --> 01:32:25.362
with rockets of silver iodide.

01:32:25.497 --> 01:32:27.036
[Boone] Yeah,
makes 'em rain, right?

01:32:27.171 --> 01:32:29.005
[Tyler] Yep. Rain is
what we need in the updraft.

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:31.538
And then we're gonna take
the sodium polyacrylate

01:32:31.673 --> 01:32:33.404
and we're gonna deliver it
in the vortex...
Don't touch that.

01:32:35.482 --> 01:32:36.911
Increasing the cold pool.

01:32:37.047 --> 01:32:39.745
[Ben] And that does what
to the tornado?

01:32:39.881 --> 01:32:40.851
Cuts the fuel, Ben.

01:32:41.849 --> 01:32:43.382
[Boone] Lily.

01:32:43.517 --> 01:32:45.457
Oh, look at Cairo
looking all cute and whatnot.

01:32:45.592 --> 01:32:46.422
- Hey, buddy.
- [song ends]

01:32:46.557 --> 01:32:48.595
[insects chirping]

01:32:51.266 --> 01:32:53.259
[pensive music playing]

01:33:01.199 --> 01:33:02.235
[camera shutter clicks]

01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:25.456
[camera beeps, clicks]

01:33:26.565 --> 01:33:28.091
She is your story, Ben.

01:33:28.226 --> 01:33:30.901
[Ben chuckles, sighs]

01:33:34.969 --> 01:33:36.137
Get me a copy of that.

01:33:37.774 --> 01:33:39.008
Let's get out of here.

01:33:42.612 --> 01:33:46.785
Uh, no offense, but I'm gonna
get a ride with someone else.

01:33:52.394 --> 01:33:54.826
[thunder rumbling softly]

01:33:57.892 --> 01:33:59.765
[wind howling]

01:34:09.441 --> 01:34:10.571
That's it.

01:34:10.706 --> 01:34:11.973
Hell yeah.

01:34:12.109 --> 01:34:14.477
- We got it. We got it.
- All right.

01:34:14.612 --> 01:34:16.606
[thunder rumbling]

01:34:23.617 --> 01:34:25.786
Okay, ground speed's at 22.
Intercept is northeast.

01:34:25.921 --> 01:34:27.419
Look for Siloam Road.

01:34:28.592 --> 01:34:29.520
Siloam Road.

01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:33.361
- [engine roaring]
- [tires squealing]

01:34:33.497 --> 01:34:34.529
[gasps]

01:34:34.664 --> 01:34:35.900
[laughing]

01:34:37.968 --> 01:34:39.870
- [horn honking]
- Whoa, whoa!

01:34:40.005 --> 01:34:41.533
- Come on!
- Hey, what are you doing?

01:34:41.668 --> 01:34:44.502
Hey! These storm buttheads
are cutting us off, man.

01:34:47.274 --> 01:34:48.538
I told you we didn't need her.

01:34:48.673 --> 01:34:50.376
All right,
let's not get distracted.

01:34:52.116 --> 01:34:53.720
Let's get these babies
in the air!

01:35:02.792 --> 01:35:05.797
[thunder crashing]

01:35:05.932 --> 01:35:07.996
I can't see it right now.
I lost it.

01:35:08.132 --> 01:35:09.201
[Scott] It's tracking
straight ahead.

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:10.503
I'd say push it.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:11.831
Get ahead of it,
get ahead of it.

01:35:11.966 --> 01:35:13.971
[engines revving]

01:35:22.977 --> 01:35:24.310
Doppler went dark.

01:35:24.446 --> 01:35:25.911
[Tyler] That's probably
a dead cell zone.

01:35:26.047 --> 01:35:27.721
Lily, are you above us?

01:35:29.054 --> 01:35:30.652
It's getting
completely rain-wrapped.

01:35:30.788 --> 01:35:32.088
I can't see a thing.

01:35:35.392 --> 01:35:37.128
We just got to push through
this rain curtain.

01:35:37.264 --> 01:35:38.094
Oh.

01:35:40.531 --> 01:35:41.467
[groans]

01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:43.192
Yeah, I just lost my drone.

01:35:43.328 --> 01:35:44.599
Hey, we lost visual.

01:35:44.735 --> 01:35:46.773
[wind howling]

01:35:57.078 --> 01:35:58.577
I can't see anything.

01:35:58.712 --> 01:36:00.049
[Scott] That's all right.
Just keep straight.

01:36:00.185 --> 01:36:01.113
I can see the road.
You see the road?

01:36:01.248 --> 01:36:02.546
[Javi] This feels different.

01:36:02.681 --> 01:36:04.087
I'm telling you,
I think we should stop.

01:36:04.222 --> 01:36:05.416
[Scott] Just keep going.
We'll get ahead of it.

01:36:05.552 --> 01:36:06.725
- Scott, we have to stop!
- Keep going!

01:36:06.860 --> 01:36:07.590
- We'll get ahead of it!
- Oh, shit!

01:36:07.725 --> 01:36:09.092
[tires squealing]

01:36:09.227 --> 01:36:10.221
- [Scott grunts]
- Oh, God! It's right there!

01:36:10.357 --> 01:36:11.792
It's right there! Right there!

01:36:11.928 --> 01:36:14.023
Get down! Get down!

01:36:14.158 --> 01:36:15.025
Javi!

01:36:15.161 --> 01:36:17.100
[wind roaring]

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.366
- Oh, God.
- [gasping]

01:36:23.237 --> 01:36:25.370
- Oh!
- Hold on, y'all.

01:36:25.506 --> 01:36:26.712
[Kate] Tyler,
we got to do something.

01:36:26.848 --> 01:36:28.409
[Boone] Hey!
On your left, guys!

01:36:28.545 --> 01:36:29.816
- It's hitting something big!
- [explosion rumbling]

01:36:31.249 --> 01:36:33.281
- [Kate] Oh, my God.
- [electricity crackling]

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:43.687
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:36:43.823 --> 01:36:45.826
Wait, wait, wait.
We can't just leave them.

01:36:45.961 --> 01:36:47.328
We're not gonna leave them,
but we got to move!
We got to move!

01:36:49.934 --> 01:36:51.798
Back up, back up, back up!

01:36:51.933 --> 01:36:53.636
Dex! Go! Go!

01:36:53.772 --> 01:36:55.435
It's flying at us, man!

01:36:55.570 --> 01:36:56.700
- Go faster!
- [Dexter] I'm going, I'm going!

01:37:01.109 --> 01:37:02.138
[panicked grunting]

01:37:02.273 --> 01:37:03.883
[explosion]

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:07.546
Oh!

01:37:08.556 --> 01:37:11.323
[grunting, panting]

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.353
[Kate] Javi.

01:37:27.803 --> 01:37:28.633
Oh, God.

01:37:29.244 --> 01:37:30.140
Hang on.

01:37:31.302 --> 01:37:32.472
[engine revving]

01:37:34.448 --> 01:37:35.678
[grunting]

01:37:35.813 --> 01:37:37.675
[tires squealing]

01:37:39.317 --> 01:37:41.415
Come on, come on.
Hang on, Scott. [grunts]

01:37:45.285 --> 01:37:46.519
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:37:47.385 --> 01:37:49.225
[tires squealing]

01:37:50.632 --> 01:37:51.997
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:38:10.474 --> 01:38:11.841
Is everybody okay?

01:38:12.650 --> 01:38:14.249
Yeah.

01:38:14.385 --> 01:38:16.052
- [Ben] We're okay.
- Yeah, we're good, man.

01:38:16.188 --> 01:38:18.056
- We're moving.
- Are you seeing this?

01:38:20.487 --> 01:38:22.390
Look at the size of that thing.

01:38:23.663 --> 01:38:24.524
This is good.

01:38:25.224 --> 01:38:26.531
[panting]

01:38:26.667 --> 01:38:27.659
No, that ain't good.

01:38:28.667 --> 01:38:29.562
That ain't good.

01:38:30.967 --> 01:38:32.433
It's shifting.

01:38:32.569 --> 01:38:34.567

01:38:58.629 --> 01:39:00.630
Okay, guys, there's nothing
we can do to stop it,

01:39:00.765 --> 01:39:02.934
but when you get there,
make sure people get to
a safe place.

01:39:03.069 --> 01:39:04.236
All right, Dani,
where am I headed?

Look, when you get to New York,
with the review board,

01:51:32.812 --> 01:51:35.247
they're gonna say that it was
the fire from the refinery

01:51:35.383 --> 01:51:37.154
or the smoke
or a million other things

01:51:37.289 --> 01:51:39.085
that caused that tornado to
vanish, and that's fine, too.

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.348
But the point is,
is that we know

01:51:40.484 --> 01:51:41.892
these things can be disrupted,

01:51:42.027 --> 01:51:43.055

a whole new branch of research
