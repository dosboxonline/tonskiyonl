Good morning, Stacy.

Normally, I would address

20:06.072 --> 20:08.441

come to understand,

Mr. Manfredi.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.255
[Dwight]
Okay.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.624
We are acquainted, right, Stacy?

20:24.624 --> 20:26.593
Yes, we are.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.728
Do you remember
where we first met?

20:28.728 --> 20:29.796
Yes.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.598
[Dwight] Could you tell us
about it, please?

20:31.598 --> 20:34.100
It was at a bar called
the Bred-2-Buck.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.603
I was there with friends,
part of a bachelorette party.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.805
Was it me
who approached you first?

20:38.805 --> 20:39.806
No.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.642
- I spoke to you first.
- Right.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.811

where we went after that?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.413
A strip club.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.815
Yeah, a strip club,
and we had a good time,

20:48.815 --> 20:51.718
and you danced, had a few
laughs, I enjoyed myself,

20:51.718 --> 20:53.686
and you suggested
we go elsewhere.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.623
Do you remember where that was?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.458
- [softly] A hotel.
- [Watkins] The witness

20:58.458 --> 20:59.659

21:00.660 --> 21:01.861
A hotel.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.095
[Dwight]
Right.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.731
And we talked

21:04.731 --> 21:07.600
and got to know each other
pretty well, right?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.769
[McGrath]
Objection. Leading the witness.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.973
Isn't it true we got
pretty intimate that night?

21:13.973 --> 21:15.575
Well, I was going
through a divorce.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.776
I remember,

21:16.776 --> 21:18.945
'cause we were talking
about that after the fact.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.280
Stacy, I'm-I'm not trying
to embarrass you,

21:21.280 --> 21:23.583
I'm not, really,
but it's very important

21:23.583 --> 21:27.720
for the jury to know exactly
what went down.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.724
So, we had a few laughs,
and you asked me how old I was.

21:31.724 --> 21:36.429
I said 75 and you really
freaked out, remember?

21:36.429 --> 21:38.064
- Yes.
- [McGrath] Is there a question

21:38.064 --> 21:39.666
- in here?
- [Dwight] Yeah, there is.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.768
She wanted to leave,

21:41.768 --> 21:45.004
and I asked her,
"Was it the age gap?"

21:45.004 --> 21:47.273
And she said
it wasn't an "age gap,"

21:47.273 --> 21:48.741
it was an "age canyon,"

21:48.741 --> 21:50.977
and got out of there
as fast as you could.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.680
- [laughter]
- It was a little embarrassing.

21:53.680 --> 21:57.016

you did return for another

21:57.016 --> 21:58.785

- [McGrath] Objection.

21:58.785 --> 22:01.521
Mr. Manfredi,
rephrase the question.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.889
I'm sorry.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.625
This is not my...
[chuckles] everyday job.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.861
We did sleep together again
after that?

22:08.861 --> 22:11.531
And this was after
you reached out to me

22:11.531 --> 22:14.934
following a shooting attempt
on my life, right?

22:14.934 --> 22:16.703
Well, I was a little tipsy.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.371
- Right.
- But yes.

22:18.371 --> 22:20.707
[Dwight]
But then we sat down

22:20.707 --> 22:22.074
and we talked about
important things

22:22.074 --> 22:23.943
that people talk about.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.912
- Things that friends talk about.
- [McGrath] Objection.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.780
Speculation.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.883
We were friends,
weren't we, Stacy?

22:30.883 --> 22:33.686
We did confide in each other?

22:33.686 --> 22:36.556
[low]
We confided in each other.

22:36.556 --> 22:38.057
And then you gave me information

22:38.057 --> 22:40.226
you probably shouldn't
have given,

22:40.226 --> 22:41.894
putting your career in jeopardy,

22:41.894 --> 22:45.465
information that probably
saved my life.

22:46.433 --> 22:47.900
I suppose.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.504
And then
you ultimately took a bullet

22:51.504 --> 22:54.073
that was meant for me.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.943
Now, Stacy,

22:56.943 --> 23:00.112
if somebody had done
all of these things for you,

23:00.112 --> 23:02.749
do you think you'd be thankful?

23:04.884 --> 23:07.186
- Probably.
- Do you think it's possible

23:07.186 --> 23:09.756
that you'd want to do
something for that person?

23:09.756 --> 23:12.992
Maybe give them a gift?

23:12.992 --> 23:14.026
Perhaps.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.362
And this alleged
million-dollar flash drive

23:16.362 --> 23:19.866
that the government
cannot prove came from me,

23:19.866 --> 23:22.168
is it possible that, if it did,

23:22.168 --> 23:26.506
it would have been my way
of saying thank you?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.174
I suppose.

23:28.174 --> 23:32.078
Do you know what
"quid pro quo" means?

23:32.078 --> 23:33.880
Yes.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.716
Doing a favor in exchange
for another favor.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.050
Right.

23:38.050 --> 23:42.088
And did I ever, ever ask you
for anything

23:42.088 --> 23:45.157
for this alleged
million dollars?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.426
No.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.395
So, what we've established here

23:49.395 --> 23:53.432
is a pattern
of Stacy being with me,

23:53.432 --> 23:55.401
helping me,

23:55.401 --> 23:58.137
and ultimately saving my life.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.773
So I ask Stacy and the court,

24:00.773 --> 24:02.308
is there a law

24:02.308 --> 24:06.145
that says it's a crime

24:06.145 --> 24:10.517
to want to do something nice
for somebody...

24:12.184 --> 24:14.086
...even if they are an agent?

24:15.588 --> 24:16.923
No.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.659
Thank you.

24:21.528 --> 24:24.296
No further questions,
Your Honor.

24:24.296 --> 24:25.965
[Watkins]
Mr. McGrath, your witness.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.167
- No questions.
- The witness may step down.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.839
Now, it is my understanding
that you've both agreed

24:32.839 --> 24:34.841
to forgo closing arguments?

24:34.841 --> 24:36.876
Correct, Your Honor.

24:36.876 --> 24:40.479
The jury will be dismissed
and begin deliberations.

24:42.048 --> 24:44.083
[indistinct chatter]

- Sorry.
