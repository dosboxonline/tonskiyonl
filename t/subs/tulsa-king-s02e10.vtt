11:01.128 --> 11:03.931
I was here long before you.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.966

Mm, he's fine.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.962
This week, he's going in
for his PATH certification.

I don't know
about the outfit, though.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.153
A little overdressed.

13:06.253 --> 13:07.821
I don't have a cowboy outfit.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.823
I'll get you one,

14:33.473 --> 14:35.442

I should reconsider?

14:47.287 --> 14:49.355
Yes!

14:49.356 --> 14:50.757
Reconsider.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.658
It was my father's idea
to send you out here,

14:52.659 --> 14:54.161
and it was a terrible mistake.

14:54.261 --> 14:56.863
- Your father?
- It was.

to New York.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.608

your rightful place beside me

15:46.079 --> 15:48.982
you guys wouldn't travel
a couple of miles

This isn't a negotiation.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.830

myself clear.

16:37.964 --> 16:40.400
So listen up,
and listen up fucking good.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.170
I am not going back
empty-handed.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.372
Well, I'm not going back, either.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.241
And you tell them
I'm not coming back.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.842

talking about him?

'Cause he's remarkable.

Mucked out the stalls, as well.

Is it my imagination, or...

17:45.565 --> 17:47.467
do you no longer work here?

17:48.401 --> 17:51.938
I don't, I just, I didn't have
anywhere else to go, so...

17:53.340 --> 17:55.374
I mean, the last 12 years,

17:55.375 --> 17:57.042
this place has been
my life, Margaret.

17:57.043 --> 17:59.146
I mean, you,
the ranch hands, the horses...

18:00.913 --> 18:03.082
It's like home here, you know?

18:03.816 --> 18:04.817
It's all I know.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.253
And, until recently,

18:06.353 --> 18:08.155
it was the only thing
I didn't fuck up.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.957
Yeah. And you did.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.595
You were a good manager, Armand,
but... mm-mm.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.731
I know, and I apologize
from the bottom of my heart.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.801
I'm not the one
that needs to hear that.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.473
We cleared the air
for quite a while.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.709
See, I'm trying to get
my family back,

18:29.809 --> 18:32.279
my wife and kids, and...

18:32.379 --> 18:33.846
that's the most important thing.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.449
If you could see your way
to let me have another chance,

18:36.583 --> 18:38.951
that would really go
a long way with her.

18:39.051 --> 18:41.354
I swear,
I'll be better than ever.

18:43.055 --> 18:45.124
I want you in a program...

18:45.225 --> 18:46.459
for the drinking.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.994
Done.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.135

12th fucking century?

19:33.840 --> 19:37.210
And all the time,
there's been rules,

19:37.344 --> 19:39.412
an order to things.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.848
I know you didn't come here
to lecture me

19:41.948 --> 19:43.015

19:43.149 --> 19:44.817
I came here to talk to you,
boss to boss.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.185
Boss to boss.

19:46.319 --> 19:47.854
You just finished telling me
that they put you

19:47.954 --> 19:49.322
on the shelf, Chick.
I mean, not for nothing,

19:49.422 --> 19:51.023
but you don't have
that kind of juice right now.

19:51.123 --> 19:53.526
Only 'cause I allowed it
to happen.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.027

19:55.161 --> 19:56.863

the Illinois Central?

19:56.963 --> 19:58.464
What are you,

19:58.465 --> 20:01.234
My means of transportation
are irrelevant.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.935
But you want to poke shots,
go ahead.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.237
[chuckles]
No, no, I'm just being,

20:04.337 --> 20:05.837
I'm being realistic, Chick.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.040
What's not realistic?

20:08.140 --> 20:10.109
That fucking Dwight's
bulletproof?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.779
You should be thinking
about fixing things in New York

20:12.879 --> 20:15.748
with your family,
first and foremost,

20:15.882 --> 20:17.650
not going back at Dwight.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.153
Hey. What is it
with you and this guy?

20:21.254 --> 20:24.156
He's the root
of all my fucking problems.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.725
Yours, too,

20:25.825 --> 20:27.594
- if you're not careful.
- What the fuck does that mean?

20:27.727 --> 20:30.028
Pulled the same shit with you.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.732
You give him an inch,
he'll take a fucking mile.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.768
He's a greedy fuck.
I'll give you that much.

20:35.902 --> 20:38.337
And what happens
when that greed goes unchecked?

20:38.338 --> 20:40.907
What kind of message
does that send?

20:41.974 --> 20:43.443

out of respect to my father...

be reasonable.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.363
You want to whack him?

31:12.271 --> 31:14.872
I spent a long time away.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.809
It wasn't a vacation.
It was pretty bad.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.710
But during that time,
I really had

31:19.711 --> 31:22.713
to ponder these questions like,

31:22.714 --> 31:24.316
"What's life all about?

31:24.416 --> 31:27.086
What's the secret of happiness?"

31:27.186 --> 31:29.155
Everything. Well, guess what?

31:29.255 --> 31:31.022
It's not easy to figure out,

31:31.023 --> 31:35.261
and no one really is ever gonna
crack that code, definitively.

31:35.361 --> 31:37.728
What else is there?
Well, there's nothing

31:37.729 --> 31:40.933
more important
than trustworthy friendship,

31:41.067 --> 31:43.102
loyalty, family--

31:43.202 --> 31:46.805
ah, Joanne, love you--
my daughter,

31:46.939 --> 31:50.442
my grandkids,
and, of course, Margaret.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.478
My God, what do you see in me?
I don't know.

31:52.578 --> 31:53.911
[laughter]

31:53.912 --> 31:57.415
Last but not least is,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.485
we are now legit,

31:59.585 --> 32:02.654
and you do not have to look
over your shoulder anymore!

32:02.788 --> 32:04.756
- Yeah!
- [whooping]

32:04.856 --> 32:06.924
And after this weekend,
everyone's going

32:06.925 --> 32:11.397
to get a fair cut
of all the businesses.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.966
Okay? So, I want you
to enjoy yourselves.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.668
You really deserve it.

32:16.802 --> 32:19.738
And the last thing is,
you're young.

32:19.838 --> 32:23.108
You don't stay that way forever,
so really enjoy it.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.476
And... [laughs]

32:24.610 --> 32:27.813
This is a terrible pun, but,

32:27.913 --> 32:32.051
"Life goes by faster
than a speeding bullet."

32:32.151 --> 32:34.619
- [laughter]
- Okay. Thank you all.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.822
- [cheering]
- Yeah.

32:36.922 --> 32:38.224
Yeah!

32:42.228 --> 32:43.695
I think I'll keep you.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.431
That's a good idea. Thank you.

32:45.531 --> 32:46.665
[both laugh]

32:46.765 --> 32:49.001
[laughing]
How much do you cost?

32:49.101 --> 32:51.537
- Priceless.
- [laughs]

32:51.670 --> 32:54.406
[crickets chirping]

33:05.684 --> 33:07.586
[man]
Don't fucking move!

33:07.686 --> 33:09.355
Fuck! Hey!

33:09.455 --> 33:10.655
- Hey!
- Put your hands

33:10.656 --> 33:11.990
where I can see them.

33:12.091 --> 33:13.359
Just cooperate,
and you won't get hurt.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.127
[panting]

33:19.131 --> 33:22.101
