00:48.915 --> 00:50.350
<i>2020.</i>

00:50.382 --> 00:52.551
<i>Since the 1980s,</i>

00:52.584 --> 00:56.588
<i>it's been a magical year
for science fiction writers,</i>

00:56.622 --> 00:58.892
<i>a year of predictions
about the future</i>

00:58.925 --> 01:02.095
<i>and the ruthless power
of technology.</i>

01:03.062 --> 01:07.132
<i>Humanity would be bound
together by a world wide web,</i>

01:07.165 --> 01:10.303
<i>artificial intelligence
would exponentially expand</i>

01:10.336 --> 01:14.274
<i>the powers of the human mind,</i>

01:14.307 --> 01:17.043
<i>and the world would be
dominated and controlled</i>

01:17.075 --> 01:19.077
<i>by information-based
megacorporations</i>

01:19.111 --> 01:23.449
<i>without need
for government intervention.</i>

01:23.482 --> 01:28.021
<i>But all of that turned out
to be a technocratic illusion</i>

01:28.054 --> 01:30.156
<i>when nature set loose
a terrible disease</i>

01:30.188 --> 01:31.556
<i>that took advantage</i>

01:31.590 --> 01:34.327
<i>of the very connectivity
we had manufactured.</i>

01:37.462 --> 01:40.934
<i>In Seattle, the day
of reckoning was January 20th,</i>

01:40.967 --> 01:44.370
<i>when America's first patient
tested positive for COVID-19.</i>

01:47.539 --> 01:49.474
<i>On that same day in Seoul,</i>

01:49.507 --> 01:52.411
<i>the first case in South Korea
would also be confirmed.</i>

01:56.081 --> 01:59.017
<i>Korea moved quickly
to contain the disease</i>

01:59.051 --> 02:00.954
<i>and save its economy
using a variation</i>

02:00.986 --> 02:03.188
<i>on an American plan.</i>

02:03.221 --> 02:04.991
<i>But in the United States,</i>

02:05.024 --> 02:07.427
<i>politics got
in the way of science,</i>

02:07.459 --> 02:10.295
<i>Allowing the virus
to spread invisibly and fast.</i>

02:13.199 --> 02:16.702
<i>More than 200,000 people
have died.</i>

02:16.736 --> 02:18.537
<i>In the first three months
of the pandemic,</i>

02:18.570 --> 02:20.706
<i>30 million people
lost their jobs.</i>

02:20.739 --> 02:23.076
No more tyranny.
No more tyranny.

02:23.108 --> 02:28.081
Now the Democrats are
politicizing the coronavirus.

02:28.113 --> 02:29.982
You know that, right?

02:30.016 --> 02:32.018
<i>This is their new hoax.</i>

02:32.051 --> 02:33.753
Who's scared of coronavirus?

02:33.785 --> 02:36.388
- Let go of my fucking cart!
- Are you recording me, dawg?

02:36.422 --> 02:40.426
<i>I have the right to buy food
without being forced</i>

02:40.458 --> 02:42.361
to participate
in a false flag pandemic.

02:43.661 --> 02:44.629
<i>At a moment of crisis,</i>

02:44.662 --> 02:46.298
<i>the world's
most powerful nation</i>

02:46.332 --> 02:48.201
<i>didn't rise to the occasion.</i>

02:48.233 --> 02:51.170
<i>It descended
into division and chaos.</i>

02:51.202 --> 02:52.304
Back up!

02:52.338 --> 02:53.406
What the fuck
is your problem?

02:55.673 --> 02:57.642
<i>Why did the United States</i>

02:57.676 --> 03:00.245
<i>fail to reckon with a danger</i>

03:00.279 --> 03:03.683
<i>for which it should have been
so well prepared?</i>

03:03.715 --> 03:06.319
<i>It's one person coming in
from China.</i>

03:06.351 --> 03:08.787
<i>It will go away.
Just stay calm, it'll go away.</i>

03:08.820 --> 03:11.723
<i>In a couple of days it's gonna
be down to close to zero.</i>

03:11.756 --> 03:13.426
<i>We have it totally
under control.</i>

03:13.458 --> 03:15.494
<i>It's gonna be just fine.</i>

03:15.528 --> 03:18.765
<i>Breathe in
and hold your breath.</i>

03:25.804 --> 03:27.506
<i>Filming
during the time of COVID</i>

03:27.540 --> 03:29.542
<i>presented unique challenges.</i>

03:29.575 --> 03:31.810
Okay, and I hold it...

03:31.844 --> 03:34.213
- <i>There's, like, two handles.</i>
- Yup.

03:34.245 --> 03:37.350
Wow, you guys have really
figured this out, okay.

03:37.382 --> 03:39.719
<i>One work-around was
a camera system we invented,</i>

03:39.751 --> 03:42.721
<i>built off-site,
and sent to subjects.</i>

03:42.755 --> 03:45.525
<i>We dubbed it "the COVID-cam."</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:47.693
So I was able...
can I hear you?

03:47.725 --> 03:50.262
- <i>Hello, yeah!</i>
- Hi, it's working!

03:52.832 --> 03:54.567
<i>I'm Scott Becker.</i>

03:54.600 --> 03:55.835
<i>I'm the chief
executive officer</i>

03:55.868 --> 03:58.738
<i>of the Association
of Public Health Laboratories.</i>

03:58.771 --> 04:01.474
How about this?
Now, this is really something.

04:01.506 --> 04:04.843
It's an actual board game.

04:04.876 --> 04:06.144
<i>My wife said,</i>

04:06.178 --> 04:08.181
<i>"You know, we should really
get it out and play it."</i>

04:08.213 --> 04:09.815
<i>I'm like,
"We're living through it!</i>

04:09.849 --> 04:12.185
I don't need the game!"

04:12.218 --> 04:15.154
<i>One of the functions
public health labs have</i>

04:15.187 --> 04:19.425
<i>is looking for those early
indications of an outbreak.</i>

04:19.458 --> 04:23.095
<i>And when did you first hear
about the coronavirus?</i>

04:23.129 --> 04:27.533
It was January 7th,
I believe,

04:27.566 --> 04:31.203
<i>that I first communicated
with some of our staff.</i>

04:31.237 --> 04:33.606
They had sent me an email
saying, "We're watching this.

04:33.638 --> 04:36.576
"We just talked to CDC
and they're gonna

04:36.609 --> 04:38.778
be standing up their
emergency operations center."

04:38.811 --> 04:41.481
<i>And I said,
"Well, thanks for the update.</i>

04:41.513 --> 04:43.682
<i>"I've been watching this.
I'm concerned about it.</i>

04:43.715 --> 04:47.352
<i>And happy new year."</i>

04:49.454 --> 04:50.856
<i>In early 2020,</i>

04:50.889 --> 04:53.558
<i>Trump was indifferent
to the looming pandemic.</i>

04:53.591 --> 04:56.128
<i>He was reckoning
with simmering conflicts</i>

04:56.162 --> 04:58.231
<i>and the upcoming

<i>Our economy is booming,

05:42.740 --> 05:45.510
<i>between the world's
two biggest economies.</i>

05:45.544 --> 05:48.714
And we just broke
the 29,000 mark on the DOW

<i>Up until coronavirus,

05:56.321 --> 05:59.725
<i>was gonna win reelection

05:59.758 --> 06:03.863
<i>was largely going to be on
the strength of the economy.</i>

06:05.064 --> 06:08.634
<i>I covered all
of Barack Obama's two terms,</i>

06:08.667 --> 06:12.804
so I was there
during the Zika outbreak,

06:12.838 --> 06:16.242
the Ebola response.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.779
<i>As a White House reporter,
we sort of cover everything,</i>

06:19.812 --> 06:22.547
<i>so, you know, I've
bounced around every topic</i>

06:22.581 --> 06:25.350
<i>that you can possibly
imagine in the Trump term</i>

06:25.384 --> 06:28.653
and had just finished covering
the president's impeachment

06:28.687 --> 06:30.622
in the House,
and the trial in the Senate,

06:30.655 --> 06:32.891
<i>and was thinking that</i>

06:32.925 --> 06:34.559
we might actually get
a little bit of a break

06:34.593 --> 06:36.562
on the White House beat,
such as it is.

06:36.595 --> 06:39.732
<i>And then a few weeks later,
COVID happened.</i>

06:39.764 --> 06:41.333
<i>One of the first indications</i>

06:41.367 --> 06:43.001
<i>that the United States
government had that</i>

06:43.035 --> 06:45.705
this was a potential problem
was a conversation

06:45.737 --> 06:48.908
that the CDC director,
a guy named Robert Redfield,

06:48.941 --> 06:51.711
<i>had with his counterpart,
a gentleman</i>

06:51.744 --> 06:54.580
<i>by the name of Dr. Gao,
who was essentially the head</i>

06:54.612 --> 06:59.618
<i>of the Chinese CDC, and that
occurred on January 3rd.</i>

07:04.823 --> 07:07.593
<i>Chinese health authorities
are still working</i>

07:07.626 --> 07:10.429
<i>to identify the virus
behind a pneumonia outbreak</i>

07:10.461 --> 07:13.965
<i>in the central city of Wuhan.</i>

07:13.999 --> 07:16.836
<i>Gao basically said,
"Look, this is really serious.</i>

07:16.869 --> 07:18.671
<i>"You need to be aware of this.</i>

07:18.703 --> 07:20.540
<i>It's not something
we've ever seen before."</i>

07:49.667 --> 07:52.737
<i>I heard about
a novel respiratory virus</i>

07:52.771 --> 07:56.675
<i>circulating in China,
and my ears perked up.</i>

07:56.708 --> 07:59.045
There you are!

07:59.078 --> 08:01.780
<i>I've been at BARDA
for about ten years</i>

08:01.814 --> 08:04.816
<i>in the Department of Health
and Human Services.</i>

08:04.850 --> 08:07.653
<i>BARDA's role
is to lead the development</i>

08:07.686 --> 08:09.422
<i>between government
and industry</i>

08:09.454 --> 08:12.657
<i>of vaccines, drugs,
and diagnostic tests.</i>

08:12.691 --> 08:16.429
So I'm very interested,
and have been my entire career,

08:16.461 --> 08:20.699
of tracking early blips
of novel viruses

08:20.732 --> 08:22.567
that are infecting people.

08:23.701 --> 08:27.872
<i>It's not unusual for us to
hear of a new virus emerging</i>

08:27.905 --> 08:30.775
<i>in these wet markets of China.</i>

08:30.809 --> 08:33.379
<i>They can spill over
into the human population,</i>

08:33.410 --> 08:36.881
<i>especially the people working
in those wet markets.</i>

08:36.914 --> 08:39.418
But then we started seeing
China take actions

08:39.450 --> 08:43.955
<i>like build hospitals
rapidly, urgently.</i>

08:43.988 --> 08:46.725
All I could get at that point
was anecdotal stories

08:46.758 --> 08:49.127
<i>on Twitter, for example.</i>

08:49.160 --> 08:51.463
<i>But anyone who'd worked
in preparing</i>

08:51.497 --> 08:54.532
<i>for pandemic outbreaks knew
that we were dealing with</i>

08:54.565 --> 08:58.737
<i>something very unusual, very
concerning, and very deadly.</i>

09:02.641 --> 09:04.142
You'll get to it.
Don't rush.

09:04.175 --> 09:07.445
Here we go.
Now you got so exhausted.

09:07.478 --> 09:09.681
<i>So interesting about birds...</i>

09:09.714 --> 09:12.650
we had an earthquake,
and they were able to alert us

09:12.684 --> 09:15.755
15 minutes
before the earthquake.

09:15.788 --> 09:19.392
<i>Because they are connected
to the earth's compass,</i>

09:19.425 --> 09:23.628
<i>so they felt the earth
vibrating before it happens.</i>

09:23.661 --> 09:26.498
<i>But you are also a predictor
of things before they happen.</i>

09:26.531 --> 09:31.102
Yes, I am obsessed
with predicting things,

09:31.136 --> 09:34.607
<i>but that's just part
of my mathematical training.</i>

09:34.640 --> 09:36.574
<i>Dr. Lee's training allows her</i>

09:36.607 --> 09:39.578
<i>to act like a canary
in a coal mine.</i>

09:39.611 --> 09:42.615
<i>She's world-famous for the way
her mathematical modeling</i>

09:42.647 --> 09:44.916
<i>can predict the likely spread
of disease</i>

09:44.949 --> 09:46.951
<i>and assess the risk
of a pandemic.</i>

09:46.984 --> 09:49.587
<i>I have built so many models</i>

09:49.621 --> 09:52.792
<i>to describe many
different type of diseases.</i>

09:52.824 --> 09:54.193
When you see the first case,

09:54.226 --> 09:56.595
it does not mean
you only have first case.

09:56.627 --> 09:59.098
It means you have one case
plus many other cases

09:59.131 --> 10:00.866
<i>that you don't see.</i>

10:00.899 --> 10:02.934
<i>It's by the time
you have 41 cases,</i>

10:02.968 --> 10:06.070
<i>and it is, like,
at the end of December,</i>

10:06.103 --> 10:08.641
<i>then that means you have
hundreds of others.</i>

10:08.674 --> 10:12.745
<i>So I was really, really
nervous at that time.</i>

10:12.777 --> 10:13.978
I absolutely believe there's

10:14.011 --> 10:16.681
human-to-human transmission
in China.

10:16.714 --> 10:20.953
<i>If there are travelers coming
back to the U.S. or Europe</i>

10:20.986 --> 10:25.591
<i>for celebration of new year,
that would be truly a vector</i>

10:25.623 --> 10:29.561
<i>to really transmit the disease
all over the world,</i>

10:29.594 --> 10:33.231
<i>so I do feel that we are
marching to a pandemic</i>

10:33.265 --> 10:36.001
in the early part of January.

10:40.271 --> 10:42.807
<i>Starting tonight,
we're going to begin</i>

10:42.841 --> 10:45.644
<i>screening passengers
arriving from Wuhan</i>

10:45.676 --> 10:47.078
<i>at the three airports</i>

10:47.112 --> 10:49.982
<i>that see the majority
of those passengers:</i>

10:50.015 --> 10:53.686
JFK, San Francisco,
and Los Angeles.

10:53.718 --> 10:55.920
<i>Nancy Messonnier was in charge</i>

10:55.953 --> 10:57.723
<i>of public messaging for COVID</i>

10:57.756 --> 11:01.160
<i>at the Centers
for Disease Control, or CDC.</i>

11:01.193 --> 11:02.995
<i>An experienced
public health official</i>

11:03.027 --> 11:04.896
<i>and expert in vaccines,</i>

11:04.929 --> 11:07.599
<i>she had played a leading role
in the CDC's response</i>

11:07.632 --> 11:11.035
<i>to the anthrax attacks
in 2001.</i>

11:11.069 --> 11:12.472
<i>Just this week...</i>

11:19.144 --> 11:21.914
<i>Our laboratory is using
genetic sequences</i>

11:21.947 --> 11:23.649
<i>provided by the Chinese.</i>

11:23.681 --> 11:25.783
<i>We're working
on a specific diagnostic test</i>

11:25.817 --> 11:27.653
<i>to detect this virus.</i>

11:27.685 --> 11:28.786
<i>We'll be distributing
this test</i>

11:28.819 --> 11:31.623
<i>to state health departments.</i>

11:31.656 --> 11:33.725
This is
a respiratory virus.

11:33.758 --> 11:37.997
<i>It is spreading
silently, invisibly,</i>

11:38.030 --> 11:39.765
<i>person to person,</i>

11:39.798 --> 11:42.301
<i>in the air, on the surfaces.</i>

11:42.333 --> 11:45.670
<i>Every moment counts
to be able to recognize</i>

11:45.703 --> 11:47.272
<i>where the virus is</i>

11:47.305 --> 11:50.809
<i>and to learn
as much as we can about it</i>

11:50.842 --> 11:52.944
<i>so we can make life-saving
vaccines and drugs</i>

11:52.977 --> 11:55.647
<i>and diagnostic tests.</i>

11:55.680 --> 11:58.050
<i>So did the government have
some kind of plan or playbook</i>

11:58.083 --> 12:00.319
<i>that they could look to in the
event of something like this?</i>

12:00.352 --> 12:02.655
There's absolutely
a playbook.

12:02.688 --> 12:05.624
<i>We've updated playbooks
through the various years,</i>

12:05.656 --> 12:07.926
<i>and we actually used
those playbooks</i>

12:07.959 --> 12:10.762
<i>to exercise what we would do</i>

12:10.795 --> 12:13.732
<i>in an emerging, viral pandemic</i>

12:13.765 --> 12:17.937
<i>the fall
before this virus emerged.</i>

12:17.969 --> 12:19.271
<i>"Crimson Contagion" was</i>

12:19.304 --> 12:23.074
<i>a federal government exercise
conducted in 12 states.</i>

12:23.107 --> 12:25.877
<i>It simulated a pandemic
with eerie similarities</i>

12:25.910 --> 12:28.680
<i>to the coronavirus
that was to come.</i>

12:28.713 --> 12:31.583
<i>It was a very
thorough exercise,</i>

12:31.617 --> 12:35.753
<i>highly detailed, with a highly
lethal influenza virus</i>

12:35.786 --> 12:39.157
<i>that emerged in Asia</i>

12:39.190 --> 12:41.660
<i>and spread quickly
around the world.</i>

12:41.693 --> 12:44.362
We were getting daily
"pseudo-reports"

12:44.396 --> 12:47.299
<i>on the outbreak,
the death count.</i>

12:47.332 --> 12:50.102
<i>The mistakes made
during "Crimson Contagion"</i>

12:50.135 --> 12:51.770
<i>played like a preview
of coming attractions</i>

12:51.803 --> 12:54.106
<i>for the failures
of the COVID response.</i>

12:54.139 --> 12:56.775
<i>So why did the government fail
to learn the lessons needed</i>

12:56.808 --> 12:59.745
<i>to prepare
for what was to come?</i>

12:59.777 --> 13:02.247
<i>The challenge has
always been who's in charge.</i>

13:02.280 --> 13:04.783
<i>We would have disaster
leadership group meetings,</i>

13:04.815 --> 13:06.785
<i>where we would bring together</i>

13:06.818 --> 13:09.355
the Health and Human Services
network of experts,

13:09.387 --> 13:13.024
<i>and the ASPR would
convene these meetings.</i>

13:13.058 --> 13:15.126
<i>Who was, in fact, the ASPR?</i>

13:15.160 --> 13:17.929
The ASPR was Dr. Bob Kadlec.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.632
The threats our country faces
in the 21st century

13:20.665 --> 13:23.868
are very real and very serious.

13:23.901 --> 13:26.137
<i>A 26-year
Air Force veteran,</i>

13:26.170 --> 13:27.672
<i>Kadlec was a specialist</i>

13:27.705 --> 13:30.975
<i>in biological
and chemical weapons.</i>

13:31.008 --> 13:33.811
<i>As ASPR, he downplayed
the danger of pandemics,</i>

13:33.844 --> 13:36.314
<i>cut spending on emerging
infectious diseases,</i>

13:36.348 --> 13:38.349
<i>and his office
eliminated a program</i>

13:38.382 --> 13:41.219
<i>to manufacture N95 masks.</i>

13:45.290 --> 13:48.660
<i>January 18th,
I asked Dr. Kadlec</i>

13:48.694 --> 13:51.731
<i>if we could convene a disaster
leadership group meeting.</i>

13:53.865 --> 13:57.036
To my shock, his response was,

13:57.069 --> 14:01.073
<i>"I don't see
a sense of urgency."</i>

14:01.106 --> 14:04.275
<i>I just don't think he thought
there was a real opportunity</i>

14:04.309 --> 14:08.079
for this virus to come
into the United States.

14:08.112 --> 14:11.215
<i>The same day Rick
Bright reached out to Kadlec,</i>

14:11.248 --> 14:12.784
<i>Kadlec's boss, Alex Azar,</i>

14:12.818 --> 14:15.154
<i>did try to get
the president's attention.</i>

14:15.186 --> 14:18.923
<i>Azar was in charge
of the CDC and the FDA</i>

14:18.957 --> 14:22.961
<i>as the secretary of HHS,
Health and Human Services.</i>

14:22.993 --> 14:26.098
<i>After the previous secretary
had resigned in scandal,</i>

14:26.131 --> 14:27.299
<i>Azar was appointed</i>

14:27.332 --> 14:30.001
<i>to bring a businessman's
approach to government.</i>

14:30.035 --> 14:33.072
<i>As a former Big Pharma
executive at Eli Lily,</i>

14:33.104 --> 14:37.742
<i>Azar was infamous for having
tripled the price of insulin.</i>

14:37.775 --> 14:39.877
I actually knew him
in grad school.

14:39.910 --> 14:43.114
<i>Very conservative,
very ambitious.</i>

14:43.147 --> 14:47.218
<i>Went on to clerk for Scalia
on the Supreme Court.</i>

14:47.251 --> 14:49.387
<i>Within the administration,</i>

14:49.420 --> 14:52.056
<i>Azar was known for his belief
that the free market</i>

14:52.089 --> 14:54.792
<i>would meet America's
healthcare needs.</i>

14:54.825 --> 14:56.360
We, the government,
do not have the solutions

14:56.394 --> 14:57.763
to healthcare.

14:57.795 --> 14:59.098
We're usually the cause
of the problems.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.800
<i>With COVID, Azar
sensed that the government</i>

15:01.833 --> 15:04.770
<i>might have to play
some limited role.</i>

15:04.803 --> 15:08.073
<i>On January 18th, he knew
that the president</i>

15:08.106 --> 15:12.945
<i>was leaving town in a couple
of days to go to Davos,</i>

15:12.977 --> 15:15.146
and Azar decided,
"You know what?

15:15.179 --> 15:16.781
<i>"I think I'd better make sure</i>

15:16.814 --> 15:20.385
<i>the president is aware
of this virus."</i>

15:20.418 --> 15:23.889
<i>Trump was actually on the
golf course down at Mar-a-Lago</i>

15:23.921 --> 15:27.091
<i>when Azar called.</i>

15:27.125 --> 15:29.361
<i>Azar's pitch to the president</i>

15:29.394 --> 15:31.997
<i>was one,
this could be serious,</i>

15:32.030 --> 15:34.766
<i>but also he wanted to convey
a sense of kind of,</i>

15:34.800 --> 15:37.301
"We got this."

15:37.334 --> 15:39.470
<i>Of those two messages, the one</i>

15:39.503 --> 15:41.506
<i>that President Trump appears
to have really internalized</i>

15:41.540 --> 15:43.509
<i>was the "we got it" message.</i>

15:49.814 --> 15:53.285
<i>The CDC has identified
a case of coronavirus</i>

15:53.318 --> 15:55.319
<i>in Washington State.</i>

15:55.352 --> 15:56.988
Have you been briefed
by the CDC...

15:57.021 --> 15:58.523
I have.

15:58.556 --> 16:00.358
Are there worries
about a pandemic at this point?

16:00.391 --> 16:01.859
No, not at all,
and we're...

16:01.892 --> 16:03.427
we have it totally
under control.

16:03.460 --> 16:06.397
It's one person
coming in from China.

16:06.430 --> 16:10.368
And we have it under control.
It's gonna be just fine.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.441
<i>I actually think
we were very fortunate</i>

16:17.474 --> 16:20.845
<i>that the first case occurred
in the Seattle region.</i>

16:20.878 --> 16:23.881
<i>I sometimes call Seattle
sort of the CDC of the West</i>

16:23.915 --> 16:26.517
because there are so many
public health researchers

16:26.550 --> 16:29.320
and public health people
that end up in Seattle,

16:29.353 --> 16:33.592
<i>so in some ways I felt like,
"Okay, they're on top of it,</i>

16:33.625 --> 16:36.295
<i>and we're in good hands."</i>

16:36.328 --> 16:37.730
<i>My name's Alex Greninger,</i>

16:37.762 --> 16:41.199
<i>and I'm the assistant director
of the Clinical Virology Lab</i>

16:41.232 --> 16:43.035
<i>here at the University of
Washington Medical Center.</i>

16:43.068 --> 16:44.602
Hello.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.505
<i>Everything about that
first case from Washington</i>

16:46.538 --> 16:47.906
<i>was just so positive.</i>

16:47.939 --> 16:50.275
<i>I mean, like... let's go through
all the positivity there.</i>

16:50.308 --> 16:52.110
You know,
someone self-identifies,

16:52.142 --> 16:56.348
says, "Hey, I just flew in
from Wuhan and I have a fever."

16:56.381 --> 16:59.184
<i>The sample was sent overnight
to the CDC,</i>

16:59.217 --> 17:01.920
<i>where they turned around
a test, which is crazy.</i>

17:01.953 --> 17:03.856
They actually had a test
for the virus,

17:03.888 --> 17:08.459
where the genome had just
gone online 10 days prior.

17:08.492 --> 17:11.494
CDC also sent a team out
immediately

17:11.529 --> 17:14.098
upon that confirmation.

17:14.132 --> 17:16.034
<i>They, you know,
looked at all of his contacts</i>

17:16.067 --> 17:18.636
<i>and there was
no onward transmission.</i>

17:18.669 --> 17:21.372
We never identified
another case in

17:21.405 --> 17:24.576
the state of Washington until
the last week of February.

17:24.608 --> 17:27.478
But if you recall,
he was not tested

17:27.511 --> 17:32.117
<i>until four days
after when he became ill.</i>

17:32.149 --> 17:35.052
<i>And he took a share ride
back home from the airport,</i>

17:35.086 --> 17:37.222
<i>he had lunch
with his colleagues,</i>

17:37.254 --> 17:40.591
<i>and he did a lot of things
within four days.</i>

17:40.625 --> 17:42.961
<i>And so I estimate that
that is at least in the order</i>

17:42.993 --> 17:45.496
<i>of 2,000 people
that has to be tested,</i>

17:45.530 --> 17:50.167
<i>and so we end up missing
a lot of the cases.</i>

17:50.201 --> 17:51.603
We're not doctors,
but we know a doctor,

17:51.636 --> 17:53.905
and he's actually
an expert in viruses.

17:53.938 --> 17:56.240
Dr. Alex Greninger at UDub,
you're one of the leading...

17:56.273 --> 17:58.910
<i>I just became
an assistant professor,</i>

17:58.944 --> 18:00.945
and so for this new virus, you
know, they sort of invited me

18:00.979 --> 18:03.181
to go on the news
to talk about it.

18:03.213 --> 18:06.083
<i>I remember later that day,
I was in a second interview,</i>

18:06.117 --> 18:08.252
and like,
in the middle of the interview,

18:08.286 --> 18:09.922
the interviewer stopped it
and said, "Oh,

18:09.954 --> 18:13.125
"they just shut down, like,
the city of Wuhan

18:13.157 --> 18:16.127
<i>and there's no more transport
in and out of it."</i>

18:16.161 --> 18:18.697
<i>11 million people
are under quarantine,</i>

18:18.730 --> 18:22.300
and you're just kind of like,
"Wow, that just

18:22.334 --> 18:24.269
doesn't even seem like
it's what's gonna happen."

18:24.301 --> 18:26.103
<i>Like, you've just never
seen, like, a parallel world</i>

18:26.136 --> 18:28.572
<i>like that, what was gonna
happen here too.</i>

18:31.041 --> 18:33.578
<i>How do you look
at that more than one month</i>

18:33.610 --> 18:37.014
<i>of not having any other cases
in the state of Washington?</i>

18:37.048 --> 18:39.718
Oh, yeah, it was a total lie.

18:39.751 --> 18:42.154
In terms of, like, you know,
whether there was actual, like,

18:42.186 --> 18:43.588
you know, whether there were
no cases there, right?

18:43.620 --> 18:45.256
I mean "lie" is not
the right word,

18:45.290 --> 18:49.328
but just a sort of a...
you know, it was a delusion.

18:50.729 --> 18:51.930
<i>The delusion was</i>

18:51.963 --> 18:55.701
<i>that the first COVID patient
was the only one.</i>

18:55.733 --> 18:57.703
<i>In fact, the disease
was already spreading</i>

18:57.735 --> 19:00.104
<i>inside the United States.</i>

19:00.137 --> 19:03.341
<i>The challenge for scientists
was to convince politicians</i>

19:03.375 --> 19:05.010
<i>to mobilize the country</i>

19:05.042 --> 19:09.180
<i>to fight a virus
no one could see.</i>

19:09.213 --> 19:11.349
<i>In a meeting on January 23rd,</i>

19:11.383 --> 19:15.153
<i>Rick Bright made his pitch
to Alex Azar.</i>

19:15.185 --> 19:17.489
<i>My assignment,
remember in BARDA,</i>

19:17.521 --> 19:19.624
<i>is to make sure
that we start making</i>

19:19.656 --> 19:24.096
drugs, vaccines, and those
tests as quickly as possible.

19:24.128 --> 19:28.733
We were told the CDC was
working diligently on a test,

19:28.767 --> 19:32.537
and we were relying
solely on the CDC.

19:32.569 --> 19:36.107
<i>I raised the need to get
started immediately</i>

19:36.140 --> 19:39.143
<i>on commercial test development
drugs and vaccines,</i>

19:39.176 --> 19:42.079
<i>and the need for money
to do it.</i>

19:42.113 --> 19:44.616
<i>The secretary looked at me</i>

19:44.648 --> 19:47.084
<i>and said, "You need money?"</i>

19:47.117 --> 19:49.687
And I said,
"Yes, we've exercised

19:49.721 --> 19:53.525
<i>that it would take
about $10 billion."</i>

19:53.558 --> 19:57.261
<i>Without that experience
and knowledge,</i>

19:57.294 --> 19:58.629
<i>I might not have walked
into that room</i>

19:58.663 --> 20:00.565
<i>and asked for those things,</i>

20:00.598 --> 20:02.832
but I knew exactly
what was needed.

20:02.834 --> 20:06.238
<i>I learned after
that meeting, actually,</i>

20:06.271 --> 20:09.074
<i>that a lot of the people
were pretty offended</i>

20:09.107 --> 20:11.143
<i>that I would come into
a meeting with the Secretary</i>

20:11.175 --> 20:14.245
<i>on day one and ask for money.</i>

20:14.279 --> 20:16.248
And it caused
quite a shit storm,

20:16.280 --> 20:18.316
is how it was described to me,

20:18.348 --> 20:21.052
that I ruffled
a lot of feathers.

20:21.086 --> 20:23.387
In fact, I wasn't invited back
to those meetings

20:23.421 --> 20:24.790
for some time.

20:26.857 --> 20:30.095
<i>In the U.S.,
political appointees tightened</i>

20:30.127 --> 20:33.464
<i>their purse strings and hoped
the virus would just go away.</i>

20:33.498 --> 20:37.803
<i>South Korea reacted
very differently.</i>

20:37.836 --> 20:40.439
<i>When it came
to this disease response</i>

20:40.472 --> 20:42.206
<i>here in South Korea,</i>

20:42.240 --> 20:45.544
<i>the politicians largely
stayed out of the response</i>

20:45.577 --> 20:48.047
<i>and it was left in the hands
of professionals.</i>

20:51.448 --> 20:54.085
<i>After confirming its first
case of the new coronavirus,</i>

20:54.118 --> 20:57.588
<i>South Korea is stepping up
precautionary measures.</i>

20:59.823 --> 21:02.193
- Hello.
- <i>Hello.</i>

21:02.226 --> 21:05.530
The first case was
a 35-year-old woman

21:05.562 --> 21:09.501
<i>who had entered the country
from Wuhan, China.</i>

22:03.288 --> 22:05.156
- Okay?
- No.

22:05.190 --> 22:06.391
No?

22:35.319 --> 22:36.887
<i>MERS was a coronavirus</i>

22:36.921 --> 22:38.790
<i>that terrified South Korea,</i>

22:38.822 --> 22:42.293
<i>killing 38 people
and sickening hundreds more.</i>

22:42.327 --> 22:45.262
<i>The government was vilified
for its response.</i>

22:45.296 --> 22:47.532
<i>Soon after,
legislators pursued</i>

22:47.565 --> 22:49.835
<i>a series of critical reforms.</i>

23:05.883 --> 23:08.453
<i>As a result of that,
they passed a law</i>

23:08.485 --> 23:11.723
<i>in order to speed up
the approval process</i>

23:11.755 --> 23:15.226
of these kits
in a time of emergency.

23:15.260 --> 23:17.261
<i>On January 27th,</i>

23:17.294 --> 23:19.496
<i>South Korean health officials
summoned representatives</i>

23:19.530 --> 23:21.566
<i>from more than
20 medical companies</i>

23:21.598 --> 23:25.369
<i>to put in place
a national testing program.</i>

23:25.403 --> 23:28.339
It was such an urgent
request that they just met

23:28.373 --> 23:32.611
<i>in a conference room at one of
the train stations in Seoul.</i>

23:32.644 --> 23:36.848
<i>The head of the equivalent of
the CDC, he basically said,</i>

23:36.880 --> 23:40.651
<i>"Manufacture me
these tests now</i>

23:40.684 --> 23:42.753
<i>and forget
about the approval process."</i>

23:42.787 --> 23:44.556
<i>You know, "Start using them,
start testing.</i>

23:44.588 --> 23:47.759
<i>"We will come back
to make sure it's accurate,</i>

23:47.791 --> 23:50.995
<i>but we'll do that while
you're already in the field."</i>

23:51.029 --> 23:52.196
Within a matter of days
after that,

23:52.230 --> 23:55.333
<i>the first diagnostic test kit
was approved,</i>

23:55.366 --> 23:56.768
<i>and it's a process
that typically can take</i>

23:57.799 --> 23:58.736
<i>upwards of a year.</i>

23:58.770 --> 24:00.004
There were four cases
at the time,

24:00.038 --> 24:02.674
and it would be another few
weeks before there was a death,

24:02.706 --> 24:06.777
<i>but they really felt the need
for diagnostic testing</i>

24:06.810 --> 24:08.579
<i>to be able to see
where the problem was</i>

24:08.613 --> 24:11.316
and to deal with the threat.

24:11.348 --> 24:13.018
<i>By January 27th,</i>

24:13.050 --> 24:15.787
<i>South Korea was on its way
to containing the virus</i>

24:15.819 --> 24:17.856
<i>and preventing
an economic shutdown.</i>

24:21.925 --> 24:23.528
Good morning, everyone.

24:23.560 --> 24:27.064
And thank you for joining us
here today at HHS.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.401
<i>In the United States,</i>

24:29.434 --> 24:31.802
<i>Azar continued
to emphasize the response</i>

24:31.836 --> 24:34.405
<i>that had so pleased
President Trump:</i>

24:34.438 --> 24:36.640
<i>"We've got this."</i>

24:36.674 --> 24:38.876
The playbook for responding
to an infectious disease

24:38.909 --> 24:42.946
outbreak is relatively
simple and multi-tiered.

24:42.980 --> 24:45.849
You identify cases,
isolate people,

24:45.883 --> 24:48.319
diagnose them, and treat them.

24:48.353 --> 24:49.888
Then you track down
all the contacts

24:49.921 --> 24:53.325
of the infected person, and you
do the same with those people,

24:53.357 --> 24:56.528
and the same with contacts
of contacts if necessary.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.429
It sounded
<i>like a perfect plan,</i>

24:58.463 --> 25:00.632
<i>but it was missing
a key detail.</i>

25:00.665 --> 25:02.966
<i>There was no comprehensive
national testing</i>

25:03.000 --> 25:04.669
<i>and tracing program.</i>

25:04.702 --> 25:07.739
<i>Even so, the CDC stuck
to a version of the script</i>

25:07.771 --> 25:09.006
<i>drafted by Azar.</i>

25:09.040 --> 25:10.642
The CDC will continue

25:10.675 --> 25:13.110
its aggressive public health
response strategy,

25:13.144 --> 25:15.380
working to protect
the health and safety

25:15.413 --> 25:16.748
of the American public.

25:16.780 --> 25:20.351
Right now, there is no spread
of this virus

25:20.385 --> 25:22.520
in our communities
here at home.

25:22.552 --> 25:23.620
<i>Appointed by Trump</i>

25:23.654 --> 25:26.090
<i>after his predecessor left
in disgrace,</i>

25:26.124 --> 25:28.626
<i>Redfield was
a controversial virologist</i>

25:28.658 --> 25:31.595
<i>with no experience leading
a public health agency.</i>

25:31.628 --> 25:35.065
<i>During the AIDS crisis, he
preached a religious approach,</i>

25:35.098 --> 25:38.102
<i>calling for abstinence
as a solution.</i>

25:38.136 --> 25:41.004
<i>With his former assistant,
Deborah Birx,</i>

25:41.038 --> 25:44.541
<i>Redfield's attempts to push
an unproven HIV vaccine</i>

25:44.575 --> 25:48.446
<i>were twice investigated
for scientific misconduct.</i>

25:48.479 --> 25:52.484
Redfield is a little bit
of an oddity for the CDC.

25:52.517 --> 25:55.653
<i>The CDC is an institution
filled with scientists</i>

25:55.685 --> 25:58.990
<i>and researchers who don't like
to be told that science has</i>

25:59.022 --> 26:02.059
<i>to compromise for economics
or for politics.</i>

26:02.092 --> 26:04.495
You know,
they want to be purists.

26:04.529 --> 26:08.066
<i>Donald Trump is a president
who has expressed</i>

26:08.098 --> 26:10.534
an incredible disdain
for science

26:10.568 --> 26:13.771
<i>since before he took office.</i>

26:13.805 --> 26:15.507
<i>Inside the West Wing,</i>

26:15.540 --> 26:19.077
they refer to the CDC
as the Deep State.

26:19.109 --> 26:23.548
<i>Certainly many of the people
at the CDC saw Redfield</i>

26:23.580 --> 26:26.950
<i>as not having the kind of
backbone that they would like</i>

26:26.983 --> 26:29.853
<i>to have seen in a CDC director</i>

26:29.886 --> 26:31.655
to stand up to the president

26:31.688 --> 26:35.426
both privately,
but also publicly.

26:38.495 --> 26:41.432
<i>Some scientists
were willing to push back.</i>

26:41.465 --> 26:43.600
<i>Public health officials
from around the country</i>

26:43.634 --> 26:47.439
<i>shared doubts that the CDC
was responding to the virus</i>

26:47.472 --> 26:48.973
<i>with enough speed and concern.</i>

26:49.005 --> 26:50.974
<i>They circulated
an email chain,</i>

26:51.008 --> 26:54.813
<i>which included Trump
officials, called "Red Dawn."</i>

26:56.580 --> 26:58.550
What's going on here,
my friend?

26:58.582 --> 27:00.551
<i>It was a
tongue-and-cheek nod</i>

27:00.585 --> 27:04.222
<i>to a 1984 movie about a small
band of American citizens</i>

27:04.254 --> 27:06.056
<i>who fight back
against a Russian invasion.</i>

27:06.089 --> 27:08.025
<i>This is the Emergency
Broadcast System.</i>

27:08.059 --> 27:09.194
<i>We are under attack by...</i>

27:09.226 --> 27:11.228
<i>We were a little bit
like the Wolverines</i>

27:11.261 --> 27:12.797
<i>from that movie.</i>

27:12.829 --> 27:13.798
They know who
all of you are.

27:13.830 --> 27:15.666
They're looking for you.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.569
<i>A group of teenagers
that are fighting back,</i>

27:18.603 --> 27:20.605
and one of us thought
it would be funny

27:20.637 --> 27:24.576
to use "Red Dawn"
as the subject title.

27:24.608 --> 27:27.678
<i>That email chain, it's a group</i>

27:27.712 --> 27:31.015
<i>of former and current
state and local officials</i>

27:31.048 --> 27:33.984
<i>within the federal government.</i>

27:34.018 --> 27:36.521
<i>These are all very
dear colleagues that have been</i>

27:36.553 --> 27:40.123
in public health and emergency
response for a long time.

27:40.156 --> 27:44.761
<i>In late January, we were
consciously monitoring,</i>

27:44.794 --> 27:47.664
<i>trying to assess
when it hit us,</i>

27:47.697 --> 27:50.968
how big the scope
of the calamity

27:51.001 --> 27:55.205
that we are looking into.
and how to mitigate it.

27:55.239 --> 27:57.075
<i>I think in January,</i>

27:57.107 --> 27:58.275
<i>the cat was already
out of the bag</i>

27:58.309 --> 28:01.045
in terms of we had cases
in the U.S.,

28:01.078 --> 28:02.881
we had human-to-human
transmission going on

28:02.914 --> 28:04.516
<i>in the U.S.,</i>

28:04.549 --> 28:09.220
<i>and we were going to be
dealing with COVID-19.</i>

28:09.252 --> 28:11.088
I mean, I wasn't able
to sleep.

28:11.121 --> 28:13.590
<i>I couldn't stop thinking about</i>

28:13.624 --> 28:17.161
<i>what could go wrong for us.</i>

28:17.194 --> 28:19.129
<i>The "Red Dawn"
emails would be full</i>

28:19.163 --> 28:20.665
<i>of warnings
and recommendations</i>

28:20.697 --> 28:23.200
<i>from experts
in pandemic response.</i>

28:23.233 --> 28:25.602
<i>But politicians failed
to recognize</i>

28:25.636 --> 28:28.071
<i>that there were lessons
to be learned.</i>

28:28.105 --> 28:30.808
<i>There's never been anything
like this in history.</i>

28:30.840 --> 28:32.876
<i>There's never been and nobody
has ever seen anything</i>

28:32.909 --> 28:35.078
<i>like this.</i>

28:35.111 --> 28:37.648
<i>Nothing could be
further from the truth.</i>

28:37.682 --> 28:39.918
<i>To be ready for the perils
of the future,</i>

28:39.951 --> 28:43.254
<i>all one had to do
is look clearly at the past.</i>

28:43.287 --> 28:46.558
<i>In 1918,
in the midst of war,</i>

28:46.590 --> 28:49.960
<i>influenza marched across the
earth from country to country.</i>

28:49.993 --> 28:52.930
<i>Epidemic lurked everywhere.</i>

28:52.963 --> 28:56.200
<i>To ward off contagion, special
precautions were taken.</i>

29:01.238 --> 29:03.741
<i>With no vaccine
and few treatment options,</i>

29:03.773 --> 29:06.010
<i>simple but effective
precautionary measures</i>

29:06.042 --> 29:09.013
<i>like masks
were all people had.</i>

29:12.116 --> 29:16.354
<i>The H1N1 flu infected
500 million people,</i>

29:16.386 --> 29:20.825
<i>1/3 of the world's population
at the time.</i>

29:20.857 --> 29:24.028
<i>The death toll
can only be estimated</i>

29:24.060 --> 29:27.331
<i>somewhere between
20 and 50 million people.</i>

29:30.267 --> 29:32.971
<i>Since 1918,
scientific advancements</i>

29:33.003 --> 29:35.305
<i>like the invention
of the electron microscope</i>

29:35.338 --> 29:39.977
<i>have allowed us to see
the "invisible enemy."</i>

29:40.011 --> 29:42.946
<i>But even with vaccines
and advances in pathology,</i>

29:42.980 --> 29:44.949
<i>the growth
of global transportation</i>

29:44.982 --> 29:47.285
<i>made other pandemics
ever more likely.</i>

29:52.088 --> 29:56.394
<i>In 2003, a deadly
SARS coronavirus</i>

29:56.426 --> 30:00.397
<i>spread from bats to humans
was quickly contained.</i>

30:00.431 --> 30:02.967
<i>In 2009,
the Obama Administration</i>

30:03.000 --> 30:06.337
<i>faced a challenge when
a new strain of H1N1 emerged.</i>

30:06.369 --> 30:08.739
Good afternoon, everybody.

30:08.772 --> 30:12.909
<i>There's no doubt that
every president should learn</i>

30:12.943 --> 30:15.279
<i>from what has happened before.</i>

30:15.311 --> 30:19.250
President Obama felt it very
important from the beginning

30:19.282 --> 30:22.786
and all the way through
our dealing with H1N1

30:22.819 --> 30:24.922
that the scientists
make the calls.

30:24.954 --> 30:27.357
H1N1 influenza is here.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.959
<i>I'm Dr. Tom Frieden.</i>

30:28.992 --> 30:33.731
<i>I directed the CDC
from 2009 to 2017.</i>

30:33.763 --> 30:36.199
I just sprayed down
the chair with Lysol.

30:36.232 --> 30:37.234
All right.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.836
<i>We dealt with epidemics</i>

30:38.868 --> 30:43.974
<i>of Zika, Ebola, MERS,
and H1N1 influenza.</i>

30:44.008 --> 30:46.376
Our Emergency Operations Center
was activated

30:46.409 --> 30:48.912
more than 90% of the time
that I was there.

30:48.945 --> 30:50.814
That's the way of reducing
exposures,

30:50.848 --> 30:53.216
if there is a lot of H1N1.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.752
We do think there may
be some challenges, though,

30:55.786 --> 30:57.188
practical challenges.

30:57.221 --> 31:01.192
<i>President Obama made it very
clear that HHS was in the lead</i>

31:01.224 --> 31:05.029
and that I would be the
spokesperson for the flu,

31:05.061 --> 31:08.699
as he would call me,
the face of the flu.

31:08.732 --> 31:10.934
<i>H1N1 was very scary</i>

31:10.967 --> 31:14.304
<i>because children were
particularly vulnerable.</i>

31:14.338 --> 31:16.040
Hi, it's Elmo.

31:16.072 --> 31:18.275
And I'm Secretary
Kathleen Sebelius.

31:18.309 --> 31:19.743
Elmo
and Secretary Sebelius...

31:19.777 --> 31:23.848
<i>Teaching kids to sneeze into
their elbows was a big thing.</i>

31:23.880 --> 31:26.983
First, you learn to sneeze into
the bend of your arm like this.

31:27.017 --> 31:29.120
- Achoo.
- Oh, very good.

31:30.521 --> 31:33.324
<i>13,000 Americans
died from H1N1</i>

31:33.357 --> 31:34.892
<i>and the Obama Administration</i>

31:34.925 --> 31:36.993
<i>mishandled
vaccine distribution,</i>

31:37.027 --> 31:39.197
<i>but scientists gave
the administration high marks</i>

31:39.230 --> 31:40.832
<i>for moving quickly</i>

31:40.865 --> 31:43.901
<i>and being open
with the press and the public.</i>

31:43.934 --> 31:45.502
<i>Just four years later,</i>

31:45.536 --> 31:49.040
<i>the Obama Administration's
response to the Ebola crisis</i>

31:49.072 --> 31:52.442
<i>would be criticized
for being too slow.</i>

31:52.475 --> 31:54.511
In the case of Ebola
I remember being in the room,

31:54.544 --> 31:57.214
in the White House
briefing room.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.915
You guys are up here
talking about,

31:58.948 --> 32:01.118
"We have this great and
perfect system that's going

32:01.152 --> 32:04.122
"to be able to, you know,
contain this virus

32:04.155 --> 32:05.822
because we've done
all this preparation,"

32:05.856 --> 32:08.259
and yet it doesn't
look like it's working.

32:08.291 --> 32:10.794
<i>Hindsight is always 20/20.</i>

32:10.828 --> 32:13.865
I can look back at any outbreak
I worked on

32:13.897 --> 32:15.933
and say, "I made a series
of mistakes there."

32:15.965 --> 32:18.136
We all do, but the key is,

32:18.168 --> 32:20.137
are they unforced errors?

32:20.171 --> 32:21.539
I think it is important
to reflect

32:21.571 --> 32:25.041
on whatever lessons we learn,
we build and incorporate.

32:25.075 --> 32:28.078
After the Ebola crisis
passed,

32:28.111 --> 32:30.981
the Obama National Security
Council had essentially

32:31.014 --> 32:35.252
created a unit within
the National Security Council

32:35.286 --> 32:37.922
<i>dedicated to sort of
pandemic response.</i>

32:40.925 --> 32:42.393
No, I cannot see Ben.

32:42.425 --> 32:44.194
I can see his hand
when he moves it out here,

32:44.228 --> 32:46.097
but he's got a face shield on.

32:46.129 --> 32:49.166
It's pretty good.
Hardcore.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.469
<i>Beth Cameron
was in charge of countering</i>

32:51.501 --> 32:55.005
<i>biological threats
for the Obama Administration.</i>

32:55.039 --> 32:56.973
<i>We set up a new directorate</i>

32:57.007 --> 32:58.910
<i>on global health security
and biodefense,</i>

32:58.943 --> 33:02.879
<i>and I was honored to be able
to lead that directorate,</i>

33:02.913 --> 33:05.016
and also to be able to take on
a lot of the lessons

33:05.049 --> 33:08.985
that we really had learned
after the Ebola epidemic.

33:09.019 --> 33:10.488
<i>In 2016,</i>

33:10.521 --> 33:12.889
<i>Beth Cameron and her team
at the NSC</i>

33:12.923 --> 33:17.494
<i>drafted a 69-page playbook on
how to deal with a pandemic.</i>

33:17.528 --> 33:19.329
<i>The playbook was intended</i>

33:19.363 --> 33:23.167
<i>to allow people in the
White House to ask questions.</i>

33:23.200 --> 33:24.434
<i>What should we do?</i>

33:24.467 --> 33:26.436
<i>And also,
what do we need to do</i>

33:26.470 --> 33:30.007
<i>to get ahead so that we're
not constantly reacting?</i>

33:30.040 --> 33:32.210
<i>So what happened
to this playbook?</i>

33:32.242 --> 33:36.880
So the playbook is reported
to not have been used.

33:36.914 --> 33:38.516
The Obama Administration
did not leave

33:38.549 --> 33:42.019
to this administration
any kind of game plan

33:42.051 --> 33:43.620
for something like this.

33:43.654 --> 33:47.959
I have no idea why
Mitch McConnell said

33:47.992 --> 33:49.492
that he didn't know
about the playbook.

33:49.526 --> 33:51.596
<i>There were a large number
of copies</i>

33:51.628 --> 33:53.463
<i>that were spiral bound
of this playbook.</i>

33:53.496 --> 33:55.532
<i>It was briefed to
the incoming administration.</i>

33:55.566 --> 33:58.269
It did become politicized.

33:58.301 --> 34:00.271
Some have
erroneously suggested

34:00.303 --> 34:01.571
that the Trump Administration

34:01.605 --> 34:03.941
threw out
the pandemic response playbook

34:03.973 --> 34:06.944
left by the Obama-Biden
Administration.

34:06.976 --> 34:08.879
What the critics failed
to note, however,

34:08.911 --> 34:11.947
is that this thin packet
of paper was replaced

34:11.981 --> 34:15.985
by two detailed, robust,
pandemic response reports

34:16.018 --> 34:18.121
commissioned
by the Trump Administration.

34:18.155 --> 34:20.389
<i>The last thing that they
wanted was to pay attention</i>

34:20.422 --> 34:21.992
<i>to what the Obama people
wanted them</i>

34:22.025 --> 34:23.293
<i>to pay attention to.</i>

34:23.327 --> 34:25.062
They were trying
to make a clean break

34:25.094 --> 34:27.899
from what they saw
as a disastrous presidency,

34:27.931 --> 34:29.634
and this was
the Trump presidency.

34:29.667 --> 34:33.004
<i>♪ And I'm proud
to be An American ♪</i>

34:33.036 --> 34:36.040
<i>♪ Where at least
I know I'm free ♪</i>

34:36.072 --> 34:38.376
<i>I think it's important
to understand</i>

34:38.408 --> 34:40.643
<i>that biological threats
are not the thing</i>

34:40.678 --> 34:42.679
<i>that is always top of mind
for a senior leader.</i>

34:42.713 --> 34:45.382
<i>♪ And I'd gladly stand up ♪</i>

34:45.415 --> 34:48.251
<i>But there really was
a lot of pressure</i>

34:48.284 --> 34:49.987
<i>on all of the civil servants</i>

34:50.018 --> 34:52.022
<i>in between Barack Obama
and Donald Trump</i>

34:52.054 --> 34:55.358
to explain why we need
high-level officials

34:55.391 --> 34:59.096
who are looking at that issue
all the time.

34:59.129 --> 35:02.300
<i>After I left, I continued
to work with the Trump team</i>

35:02.332 --> 35:04.568
in my new position
outside of government

35:04.600 --> 35:08.571
until the directorate
was dissolved in May of 2018.

35:08.604 --> 35:11.309
<i>The Global National
Security Team was disbanded</i>

35:11.341 --> 35:13.044
<i>under a reorganization</i>

35:13.077 --> 35:16.414
<i>by Trump's National
Security Advisor, John Bolton.</i>

35:16.446 --> 35:19.082
<i>It was really shocking
that any administration</i>

35:19.115 --> 35:23.219
would get rid of so much
experience and expertise

35:23.252 --> 35:25.655
and the collaboration
and coordination

35:25.689 --> 35:29.093
that comes with that...
those years.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.294
<i>From the moment
of Trump's inauguration,</i>

35:31.327 --> 35:34.197
<i>the guiding slogan of staffing
was not "you're hired,"</i>

35:34.231 --> 35:36.232
<i>but "you're fired."</i>

35:36.265 --> 35:38.202
<i>Key positions went unfilled.</i>

35:38.234 --> 35:40.303
<i>Many more were eliminated.</i>

35:40.336 --> 35:42.072
<i>And when people were hired,</i>

35:42.106 --> 35:45.977
<i>experience was not nearly
as important as loyalty.</i>

35:46.010 --> 35:48.713
<i>On January 29th, the White
House announced the formation</i>

35:48.745 --> 35:50.314
<i>of an official task force</i>

35:50.347 --> 35:52.749
<i>to confront the threat
of the coronavirus.</i>

35:52.783 --> 35:54.118
<i>Well, good afternoon,
everyone.</i>

35:54.151 --> 35:55.653
I'm Alex Azar.

35:55.685 --> 35:56.886
<i>Led by Azar,</i>

35:56.921 --> 36:00.024
<i>the task force had
little scientific expertise.</i>

36:00.057 --> 36:02.660
<i>Most were businessmen
and lawyers, seemingly chosen</i>

36:02.693 --> 36:05.562
<i>for their political
or religious beliefs.</i>

36:05.595 --> 36:08.631
<i>One had been Sarah Palin's
foreign policy advisor.</i>

36:08.664 --> 36:11.134
<i>Another was
a climate change denier</i>

36:11.167 --> 36:15.305
<i>who opposed homosexuality
as an act against nature.</i>

36:15.339 --> 36:17.308
<i>The only two
public health officials</i>

36:17.341 --> 36:20.377
<i>were Redfield
and Dr. Anthony Fauci.</i>

36:20.410 --> 36:22.379
<i>At the National Institute
of Health,</i>

36:22.412 --> 36:24.481
<i>Fauci had advised
six presidents</i>

36:24.515 --> 36:27.084
<i>and had been at the forefront
of every epidemic response</i>

36:27.117 --> 36:29.319
<i>for the last 40 years.</i>

36:29.352 --> 36:32.455
The issue now with this is
that there's a lot of unknowns.

36:32.488 --> 36:34.557
As you can see
just from the media,

36:34.591 --> 36:38.162
the number of cases
have steeply inclined

36:38.194 --> 36:40.164
each and every day.

36:40.196 --> 36:41.499
<i>At the first briefing,</i>

36:41.531 --> 36:43.167
<i>they announced
no concrete programs</i>

36:43.200 --> 36:44.535
<i>to contain the virus</i>

36:44.568 --> 36:46.703
<i>inside the borders
of the United States.</i>

36:46.736 --> 36:48.805
<i>Instead, they offered
a variation</i>

36:48.839 --> 36:52.410
<i>of a familiar Trump refrain...
"build a wall."</i>

36:52.443 --> 36:55.178
Foreign nationals,
other than immediate family

36:55.211 --> 36:57.714
of U.S. citizens
and permanent residents

36:57.747 --> 37:02.252
who have traveled in China
within the last 14 days

37:02.285 --> 37:06.523
will be denied entry into the
United States for this time.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.395
<i>In the months after that,
tens of thousands of people</i>

37:11.428 --> 37:13.564
from China still make their way
into the United States,

37:13.597 --> 37:16.267
mostly Americans
who are returning home

37:16.300 --> 37:19.069
<i>and are not blocked
by that ruling.</i>

37:24.374 --> 37:26.577
<i>"Diamond Princess,"
this is your captain speaking</i>

37:26.609 --> 37:29.713
<i>from the bridge.</i>

37:29.745 --> 37:33.383
<i>We have been notified that</i>

37:33.417 --> 37:35.586
<i>10 additional people</i>

37:35.618 --> 37:39.656
<i>have tested positive
for coronavirus.</i>

37:39.689 --> 37:41.524
<i>The captain
of the "Diamond Princess"</i>

37:41.557 --> 37:43.526
<i>had docked his vessel
in Yokohama</i>

37:43.560 --> 37:47.665
<i>after learning a passenger had
tested positive for COVID-19.</i>

37:47.698 --> 37:51.602
<i>The Japanese government
ordered a 14-day quarantine.</i>

37:51.635 --> 37:54.171
<i>Eventually,
over 700 passengers</i>

37:54.203 --> 37:55.472
<i>would test positive.</i>

37:55.506 --> 37:56.874
<i>That made
the "Diamond Princess"</i>

37:56.908 --> 38:01.112
<i>the largest known outbreak
of the virus outside of China.</i>

38:01.144 --> 38:03.813
Donald Trump, save us.

38:03.847 --> 38:06.484
Get us a government-based
airplane.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.752
- Not even that, just like...
- Get us off the ship.

38:08.785 --> 38:11.321
<i>I received a phone call</i>

38:11.354 --> 38:14.891
<i>that a disaster
medical assistance team</i>

38:14.925 --> 38:18.896
<i>was being assembled
to do a rescue operation</i>

38:18.928 --> 38:22.599
to go pull American citizens
off of the "Diamond Princess"

38:22.633 --> 38:24.502
and bring them back to the U.S.

38:24.535 --> 38:27.238
<i>And I was asked
if I would be willing to go</i>

38:27.271 --> 38:29.140
<i>as an expert
to go help the team.</i>

38:29.173 --> 38:32.176
Okay, they've got a bunch
of people in white coats.

38:32.209 --> 38:34.178
They're not white coats.
They're white hazmat suits.

38:34.211 --> 38:35.513
They're white hazmat suits.

38:35.546 --> 38:37.381
They've got these
little tunnels down here.

38:37.414 --> 38:41.252
The E.T. Tunnels, I call them.

38:41.285 --> 38:43.654
<i>At the time, we still
didn't know a lot</i>

38:43.687 --> 38:46.390
<i>about
the transmission dynamics</i>

38:46.423 --> 38:51.294
<i>or even the severity
and lethality of the disease.</i>

38:51.327 --> 38:53.796
<i>The "Diamond Princess"
confirmed</i>

38:53.830 --> 38:57.568
<i>many, many of what
I was nervous about.</i>

38:57.600 --> 38:59.303
<i>First of all, it shows</i>

38:59.336 --> 39:02.339
how it spread
in a confined environment

39:02.372 --> 39:04.942
with lots of people, right?

39:04.975 --> 39:08.245
<i>Even though all of them
has their own cubicle,</i>

39:08.278 --> 39:10.647
<i>but that's exactly
like apartment complexes</i>

39:10.680 --> 39:14.584
<i>in New York City,
and you go out, right?</i>

39:14.618 --> 39:18.522
<i>You go to places confined
in a mall, and in classrooms,</i>

39:18.555 --> 39:22.193
<i>in dormitories,
in many, many settings.</i>

39:22.225 --> 39:24.327
<i>It basically gave us
a very parallel world</i>

39:24.361 --> 39:28.265
<i>of what could be happening
to us.</i>

39:28.298 --> 39:31.202
<i>Even after the ship went
into quarantine</i>

39:31.234 --> 39:34.771
<i>and passengers were really
restricted to their rooms,</i>

39:34.805 --> 39:37.875
<i>the fact that the outbreak
continued to grow demonstrated</i>

39:37.908 --> 39:41.679
<i>that there may be more
to transmission phenomenon</i>

39:41.711 --> 39:44.347
<i>than we initially thought.</i>

39:46.850 --> 39:50.453
<i>So when we saw that,
that really hit home to us</i>

39:50.486 --> 39:53.957
<i>that this is
a pretty explosive situation.</i>

39:53.990 --> 39:58.261
<i>Okay, they quarantine, but
yet the spread is like fire.</i>

39:58.294 --> 40:02.700
It shows... it really highlights
strategic tests is a must.

40:02.732 --> 40:04.801
<i>Eva Lee began
to sound the alarm</i>

40:04.834 --> 40:07.303
<i>in the "Red Dawn" emails
about asymptomatic spread</i>

40:07.336 --> 40:09.572
<i>and the need to test widely.</i>

40:09.606 --> 40:11.475
<i>She knew in early February</i>

40:11.508 --> 40:15.312
<i>what federal officials
refused to recognize.</i>

40:15.345 --> 40:16.946
<i>Only a vast infrastructure
for mass testing</i>

40:16.979 --> 40:18.881
<i>could spot and contain a virus</i>

40:18.914 --> 40:22.352
<i>that was already moving
invisibly across the country.</i>

40:22.385 --> 40:24.954
Then I thought to myself,
"That is it."

40:24.988 --> 40:27.890
We will have no chance
to contain.

40:27.923 --> 40:30.593
<i>If we are not going
to take actions now,</i>

40:30.627 --> 40:33.698
<i>we would regret and
we would be late, late, late.</i>

40:36.033 --> 40:39.636
<i>The trifecta is test,
trace, and isolate.</i>

40:39.669 --> 40:43.906
<i>You need to have all three
of those working in tandem</i>

40:43.939 --> 40:47.345
<i>to be able to take down
any infectious disease.</i>

40:48.944 --> 40:50.613
<i>I'm from Hong Kong,</i>

40:50.647 --> 40:54.685
<i>and I grew up during SARS,</i>

40:54.718 --> 40:56.787
so I guess that was my first
experience with an outbreak,

40:56.819 --> 41:01.392
which has turned out to be
an interesting reference point

41:01.425 --> 41:02.725
during this outbreak.

41:04.861 --> 41:07.531
<i>My boss was like, "You
should cover the coronavirus."</i>

41:07.564 --> 41:09.399
<i>So my question's gonna be,</i>

41:09.432 --> 41:11.635
<i>where are we deviating
from the playbook?</i>

41:11.667 --> 41:15.405
<i>That's where I hold
the government accountable.</i>

41:15.439 --> 41:19.510
<i>So the CDC made a test
that worked in their lab</i>

41:19.542 --> 41:21.878
<i>before the first case of COVID</i>

41:21.912 --> 41:25.716
<i>landed in the state of
Washington on January 20.</i>

41:25.749 --> 41:28.551
<i>What they saw as their next
step was sending test kits</i>

41:28.584 --> 41:29.986
<i>based on their design</i>

41:30.019 --> 41:33.423
<i>to public labs
around the country.</i>

41:33.457 --> 41:36.093
<i>So CDC can't just
make a test and send it out.</i>

41:36.126 --> 41:40.763
<i>They have to apply for
Emergency Use Authorization.</i>

41:40.796 --> 41:44.501
This week, the FDA issued
an Emergency Use Authorization

41:44.533 --> 41:46.703
for the CDC's diagnostic test.

41:46.736 --> 41:49.005
Having a declaration
of an emergency

41:49.039 --> 41:51.709
allows you to, like,
cut through a lot of red tape

41:51.742 --> 41:52.975
where, like, you don't have to

41:53.008 --> 41:54.911
approve things
the traditional pathway,

41:54.944 --> 41:56.979
<i>which takes many, many years.</i>

41:57.013 --> 42:00.384
<i>So it's like going through the
precheck line at the airport.</i>

42:00.417 --> 42:05.122
<i>FDA issued the EUA to CDC
really on February 4th,</i>

42:05.155 --> 42:08.425
<i>and test kits were available
on the 5th.</i>

42:08.457 --> 42:10.394
<i>The test kits
will start shipping</i>

42:10.426 --> 42:13.463
<i>to the over 100
U.S. public health labs.</i>

42:13.497 --> 42:16.700
<i>Each test kit can perform
up to 800 patient samples.</i>

42:16.732 --> 42:19.569
<i>It works in about
four to five hours' time.</i>

42:19.602 --> 42:21.003
<i>And that's pretty heroic,
in two weeks,</i>

42:21.037 --> 42:23.906
<i>to develop test kits
for the country.</i>

42:23.939 --> 42:26.676
So, so far,
speaking of the playbook,

42:26.709 --> 42:30.481
everything was going right.

42:30.513 --> 42:32.615
<i>The first thing
public health labs have to do</i>

42:32.649 --> 42:34.818
<i>after they get the test
is they have to verify</i>

42:34.850 --> 42:37.053
that the test works
in their hands,

42:37.086 --> 42:39.989
in their laboratory,
with their scientists.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.962
<i>So on Saturday, February 8th,</i>

42:44.995 --> 42:47.931
<i>labs opened up their boxes</i>

42:47.964 --> 42:50.968
<i>and they started to get
the test up and running.</i>

42:53.669 --> 42:56.406
<i>And then, the next morning,</i>

42:56.439 --> 42:58.508
I see a number of emails

42:58.542 --> 43:02.446
<i>from public health
laboratory directors saying,</i>

43:02.479 --> 43:06.550
<i>"We're seeing this problem
with one of the components</i>

43:06.582 --> 43:09.787
<i>"of the test, the N3,</i>

43:09.819 --> 43:12.423
<i>and is anyone else
seeing that?"</i>

43:12.455 --> 43:15.526
<i>Then my phone started
to blow up.</i>

43:15.559 --> 43:19.028
It became apparent that
we actually had a real problem.

43:19.062 --> 43:21.031
And I thought to myself,

43:21.064 --> 43:23.133
"Oh, my God.

43:23.165 --> 43:26.604
This is a nightmare."

43:28.772 --> 43:31.909
<i>There were many labs that
were having the same problem.</i>

43:31.941 --> 43:34.077
<i>So that was an indication</i>

43:34.109 --> 43:37.647
<i>that this was coming
from the CDC labs.</i>

43:37.680 --> 43:41.918
<i>There are three components
to the CDC-designed tests.</i>

43:41.952 --> 43:44.921
<i>They are called
the N1, N2, and N3 assay,</i>

43:44.955 --> 43:48.792
<i>and the N1 and N2 assay,
together,</i>

43:48.825 --> 43:53.931
<i>look specifically for
the COVID-19 coronavirus.</i>

43:53.964 --> 43:57.701
<i>And then they had
a 3rd component, the N3 assay,</i>

43:57.734 --> 44:02.573
<i>which was designed to look
for any coronavirus.</i>

44:02.606 --> 44:05.475
And I don't know
why they decided

44:05.508 --> 44:08.678
to throw that third part in.

44:08.711 --> 44:12.482
<i>They didn't need it,
but that third part</i>

44:12.515 --> 44:14.885
<i>is the part that caused
all the problems.</i>

44:14.917 --> 44:17.687
<i>It was
a contamination problem.</i>

44:17.720 --> 44:21.624
This was just
a huge lightbulb moment

44:21.658 --> 44:25.127
where... wow, we could
really be on pause.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.030
<i>The CDC says they're working
with states now</i>

44:28.064 --> 44:29.299
<i>to fix the tests.</i>

44:29.332 --> 44:33.237
<i>They did not say how many
of the kits have flaws.</i>

44:33.269 --> 44:35.037
<i>Now, this was
really frustrating</i>

44:35.071 --> 44:36.906
<i>to a lot of lab directors
because they were like,</i>

44:36.939 --> 44:40.276
<i>"Look, the N1 and N2 part
of this test are working</i>

44:40.310 --> 44:41.311
<i>"totally fine,</i>

44:41.345 --> 44:45.015
<i>"so why don't we
just ignore the part</i>

44:45.048 --> 44:47.050
<i>that isn't working?"</i>

44:47.082 --> 44:48.651
Under an Emergency Use
Authorization,

44:48.685 --> 44:50.220
you're not supposed to do that.

44:50.252 --> 44:54.223
<i>You have to run that test
exactly as it's assigned.</i>

44:54.256 --> 44:55.925
<i>As it turned out,</i>

44:55.959 --> 44:58.694
<i>over 90% of public health labs</i>

44:58.727 --> 45:02.198
<i>had tests
that were not working.</i>

45:02.231 --> 45:05.167
So it was really
as if we were flying blind,

45:05.200 --> 45:07.637
and we knew it, and frankly,

45:07.671 --> 45:11.008
there was nothing
we could do except wait.

45:15.745 --> 45:18.015
<i>There was a working
effective test</i>

45:18.048 --> 45:20.917
<i>that was created
in a German laboratory</i>

45:20.950 --> 45:23.119
<i>that was being distributed by
the World Health Organization</i>

45:23.153 --> 45:25.088
<i>to countries
all around the world.</i>

45:25.120 --> 45:27.189
<i>It is available now</i>

45:27.222 --> 45:30.026
and we are shipping
an essential component to labs

45:30.060 --> 45:33.864
<i>to really start
working immediately.</i>

45:33.897 --> 45:37.100
<i>The WHO test
quite frankly is used</i>

45:37.133 --> 45:40.636
<i>for low and moderately
income countries.</i>

45:40.669 --> 45:43.339
<i>I think it would've
been very unusual</i>

45:43.372 --> 45:47.577
to use another country's test,
and not for political reasons.

45:47.611 --> 45:51.281
Just, I guess, because of maybe
scientific hubris.

45:51.314 --> 45:54.118
<i>We've never had a failure
like this.</i>

45:56.986 --> 45:59.755
<i>Despite the
technical problems at the CDC,</i>

45:59.789 --> 46:01.624
<i>the Trump Administration
could have insisted</i>

46:01.658 --> 46:04.595
<i>on an alternate plan.</i>

46:04.627 --> 46:07.698
<i>Public labs could have pivoted
to the WHO test</i>

46:07.731 --> 46:10.133
<i>or removed the N3 element.</i>

46:10.165 --> 46:12.602
<i>Test manufacturers
and clinical labs</i>

46:12.635 --> 46:15.204
<i>were eager to start making
their own tests,</i>

46:15.238 --> 46:18.274
<i>but for reasons
that remain unexplained,</i>

46:18.307 --> 46:23.713
<i>the FDA put the brakes
on the approval process.</i>

46:23.747 --> 46:24.948
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:24.981 --> 46:28.251
Looks like the setup
is pretty good.

46:28.283 --> 46:30.620
<i>Oh, good, doctor approved?</i>

46:30.653 --> 46:33.289
Yup, exactly.

46:33.323 --> 46:35.392
<i>My name is Taison Bell.</i>

46:35.425 --> 46:37.361
I'm an infectious disease
and critical care physician

46:37.394 --> 46:38.794
at the University of Virginia.

46:38.827 --> 46:42.798
<i>I'm the director
of the COVID ICU.</i>

46:42.832 --> 46:44.301
<i>It's really important to know</i>

46:44.334 --> 46:45.736
<i>who's positive
in the community</i>

46:45.769 --> 46:48.972
<i>and to be able to test in a
widespread, aggressive fashion</i>

46:49.004 --> 46:51.642
<i>so we can really stop
the chain of transmission</i>

46:51.675 --> 46:53.243
<i>of the virus.</i>

46:53.276 --> 46:55.946
<i>Traditionally,
there's a lot of leeway</i>

46:55.979 --> 46:58.381
<i>when it comes
to federal regulations</i>

46:58.414 --> 46:59.849
<i>and hospital laboratories'
ability</i>

46:59.883 --> 47:01.651
<i>to set up
their in-house testing,</i>

47:01.685 --> 47:03.820
<i>but the thing about
the emergency declaration</i>

47:03.852 --> 47:06.656
<i>was that it made
the diagnostic innovation</i>

47:06.689 --> 47:09.825
<i>more difficult because now
it had to go through the FDA.</i>

47:09.859 --> 47:11.094
<i>So now, all of a sudden,</i>

47:11.127 --> 47:14.131
<i>any university laboratory
that has the experience</i>

47:14.164 --> 47:16.165
<i>and the know-how to set up
their own in-house testing</i>

47:16.198 --> 47:18.968
now has to clear it
in order to make this work.

47:21.203 --> 47:23.039
<i>We're not
a public health lab.</i>

47:23.073 --> 47:25.308
<i>As a clinical lab,
we're not part of this system.</i>

47:25.341 --> 47:26.443
You know, the CDC and the state
public health labs

47:26.475 --> 47:27.443
are fantastic,

47:27.477 --> 47:29.279
<i>but clinical labs,</i>

47:29.312 --> 47:31.147
<i>like hospital clinical labs,
commercial labs,</i>

47:31.180 --> 47:34.784
<i>perform 90% to 95% of testing.</i>

47:34.818 --> 47:38.055
We really are the front lines
of the public health system,

47:38.088 --> 47:39.756
<i>and so it's really important</i>

47:39.789 --> 47:42.825
<i>that we're a part of
that conversation as well.</i>

47:42.859 --> 47:45.062
<i>So we're trying
to figure out, is it better</i>

47:45.095 --> 47:47.930
to just deal with the FDA
and the backlog there

47:47.964 --> 47:49.966
and set up
our own in-house testing,

47:49.999 --> 47:52.002
<i>or do we just wait for the CDC</i>

47:52.035 --> 47:54.004
<i>to fix the issues
with the test?</i>

47:54.037 --> 47:57.073
<i>We decided initially to wait,</i>

47:57.106 --> 47:59.942
and that was
the wrong decision.

47:59.975 --> 48:01.711
<i>Many labs gave up</i>

48:01.745 --> 48:04.915
<i>rather than face the thicket
of bureaucratic rules.</i>

48:04.948 --> 48:07.017
<i>But Alex Greninger
did not give up,</i>

48:07.050 --> 48:08.185
<i>and instead began</i>

48:08.218 --> 48:11.754
<i>to slog through
the FDA regulatory process.</i>

48:11.787 --> 48:14.256
<i>So at that point, you had
to really go fully in.</i>

48:14.289 --> 48:16.058
<i>You gotta make your own test.</i>

48:16.091 --> 48:18.360
<i>So we got the template
and the paperwork.</i>

48:18.394 --> 48:19.830
<i>You couldn't get
the comments back</i>

48:19.863 --> 48:22.265
<i>until you mail in
the document.</i>

48:22.298 --> 48:23.767
<i>Even though you'd
email a document,</i>

48:23.800 --> 48:26.068
<i>you had to burn it to a CD
or a USB</i>

48:26.102 --> 48:27.870
<i>and physically send
the document as well.</i>

48:27.903 --> 48:30.840
<i>The original process suggested</i>

48:30.874 --> 48:34.310
<i>testing 50 positive samples,</i>

48:34.343 --> 48:36.278
but in that case in the U.S.,
there were 14 known cases.

48:36.312 --> 48:38.848
<i>But even getting
that one sample,</i>

48:38.881 --> 48:42.952
<i>that one positive sample,
was the hardest part.</i>

48:42.986 --> 48:45.856
And obtaining clinical material
from the CDC

48:45.888 --> 48:48.959
is very difficult.

48:48.992 --> 48:51.827
<i>And I think that was
when you realize</i>

48:51.861 --> 48:55.432
that the FDA and the CDC
maybe hadn't talked a ton.

48:55.464 --> 48:59.269
<i>Swing your partner
around and 'round.</i>

48:59.301 --> 49:00.836
<i>And around.
And around.</i>

49:00.870 --> 49:02.238
<i>While federal agencies failed</i>

49:02.272 --> 49:05.442
<i>to talk to each other, the
virus swirled in mid-February</i>

49:05.475 --> 49:09.346
<i>through a series of square
dances in suburban Seattle.</i>

49:09.379 --> 49:12.449
<i>With every do-si-do,
the virus changed partners.</i>

49:12.481 --> 49:13.983
<i>But without testing,</i>

49:14.017 --> 49:17.521
<i>scientists couldn't
follow the spread.</i>

49:17.553 --> 49:20.557
<i>The emergency steps meant
for speed and innovation</i>

49:20.589 --> 49:23.926
<i>slowed the process down
to a crawl.</i>

49:23.959 --> 49:26.929
<i>The White House could have
cut through the red tape.</i>

49:26.963 --> 49:28.865
<i>The mystery
is why those in power</i>

49:28.897 --> 49:32.935
<i>didn't force the bureaucracy
to find a quick solution.</i>

49:32.968 --> 49:35.137
<i>While we were on pause,</i>

49:35.171 --> 49:38.073
<i>the anxiety level
of our members just increased</i>

49:38.106 --> 49:41.243
<i>exponentially, day after day.</i>

49:41.276 --> 49:45.414
There was just more
frustration, concern,

49:45.448 --> 49:50.386
frankly sadness,
because we weren't

49:50.419 --> 49:55.024
able to do our job.

49:55.057 --> 49:58.160
That was really tough.

50:00.028 --> 50:02.231
<i>While testing
in the U.S. was stalled,</i>

50:02.265 --> 50:04.568
<i>in South Korea, the government
was already moving</i>

50:04.600 --> 50:07.102
<i>to contain the virus
by utilizing</i>

50:07.135 --> 50:10.540
<i>a comprehensive national
testing and tracing program.</i>

50:13.343 --> 50:14.944
<i>I think they did
a much better job.</i>

50:14.977 --> 50:17.613
<i>I think starting
from the testing roll-out,</i>

50:17.647 --> 50:19.115
a lot of our jealousy early on

50:19.147 --> 50:20.916
was just how rapidly
they were able

50:20.950 --> 50:23.919
to test a large proportion
of their population.

50:23.952 --> 50:25.054
And they were testing

50:25.088 --> 50:27.256
relatively younger
asymptomatic people

50:27.289 --> 50:30.559
as well as older people
who had more severe diseases,

50:30.593 --> 50:34.064
and they were able
to do contact tracing.

50:34.097 --> 50:37.399
<i>Because of the laws
that were passed in 2016,</i>

50:37.432 --> 50:40.870
<i>enabling contact tracers
to obtain vast amounts</i>

50:40.903 --> 50:43.472
<i>of information in the name
of disease control,</i>

50:43.506 --> 50:46.475
there was a large amount
of data

50:46.508 --> 50:48.978
that authorities here
can access.

50:51.113 --> 50:54.283
<i>CCTV footage,

50:54.316 --> 50:56.385
<i>And this information
was pushed out</i>

50:56.419 --> 50:58.955
<i>to the general public
using cell phone alerts.</i>

<i>where the church had

52:26.175 --> 52:29.011
<i>Thousands of additional
people had been exposed.</i>

52:29.044 --> 52:32.214
It led to South Korea's
numbers soaring.

52:32.247 --> 52:36.519
<i>Because South Korea had
already started ramping up</i>

52:36.551 --> 52:40.622
<i>diagnostic test production,

<i>every member of this church
in Daegu</i>

52:43.392 --> 52:45.227

52:45.260 --> 52:47.696
<i>The President of South Korea
has put the country</i>

52:47.729 --> 52:51.200
<i>on the highest possible alert
after the number of cases</i>

52:51.234 --> 52:55.672
<i>jumped to more than 760
and the death toll rose to 7.</i>

52:55.705 --> 52:58.675
<i>Because of the surge
of cases in Daegu,</i>

52:58.707 --> 53:01.243
<i>South Korea started opening up
these centers.</i>

53:20.129 --> 53:22.531
<i>Drive-through testing</i>

53:22.564 --> 53:25.801
<i>and special testing booths
protected healthcare workers</i>

53:25.834 --> 53:28.604
<i>while dramatically increasing
testing capacity.</i>

53:28.638 --> 53:32.675
<i>And manufacturers were able
to keep up with the volume.</i>

53:32.707 --> 53:36.512
<i>South Korea also
stepped up production of PPE</i>

53:36.546 --> 53:40.450
<i>to protect health workers
and the public alike.</i>

53:40.482 --> 53:45.388
<i>Early adoption of testing
would save South Korea.</i>

53:45.421 --> 53:47.424
<i>At the same moment
in the United States,</i>

53:47.457 --> 53:50.560
<i>testing was still halted,
and the nation was blind</i>

53:50.593 --> 53:54.263
<i>to where and how
the virus was spreading.</i>

53:54.296 --> 53:56.165
<i>Because of all we've done,</i>

53:56.198 --> 53:59.735
<i>the risk to the American
people remains very low.</i>

53:59.769 --> 54:03.406
When you have 15 people, and
the 15 within a couple of days

54:03.439 --> 54:05.774
is going to be down to close
to zero, we're doing great.

54:05.807 --> 54:08.343
Other countries
have not been doing great.

54:08.377 --> 54:10.080
Our consumer
is very, very strong,

54:10.113 --> 54:13.216
very powerful economically.

54:13.249 --> 54:15.484
<i>Underneath
the booming economic wave</i>

54:15.517 --> 54:18.854
<i>was an invisible undertow
of disease.</i>

54:18.888 --> 54:21.458
<i>By mid-February,
pandemic models indicate</i>

54:21.490 --> 54:24.159
<i>that there were thousands
of cases spreading</i>

54:24.193 --> 54:27.296
<i>through Seattle, Chicago,
San Francisco, and New York.</i>

54:30.332 --> 54:33.836
By mid to late February,
the sort of top experts...

54:33.870 --> 54:37.173
<i>Robert Redfield,
Nancy Messonnier,</i>

54:37.205 --> 54:39.843
<i>Anthony Fauci, Azar...</i>

54:39.876 --> 54:42.479
<i>they decide,
"We gotta tell the president</i>

54:42.511 --> 54:45.881
"that we have to become
more aggressive

54:45.914 --> 54:48.117
"about warning
the American public

54:48.151 --> 54:50.220
that this is where
we're headed."

54:51.787 --> 54:55.225
<i>The problem was the president
just that next day</i>

54:55.258 --> 54:58.461
<i>left for another foreign trip
to India.</i>

54:58.493 --> 55:01.196
Well, I look forward to being
with the people of India.

55:01.229 --> 55:03.465
We're gonna have many millions
and millions of people.

55:03.499 --> 55:05.734
<i>They wanted to brief
the president obviously</i>

55:05.767 --> 55:08.137
before you sort of made
this sort of...

55:08.171 --> 55:09.705
right turn on messaging.

55:12.508 --> 55:13.776
Yeah, we're
very much involved.

55:13.809 --> 55:15.444
We're very...

55:15.477 --> 55:18.447
very cognizant
of everything going on.

55:18.481 --> 55:20.415
We have it very much
under control.

55:20.448 --> 55:21.850
Thank you very much, everybody.

55:21.883 --> 55:24.620
<i>And the doctors knew that
this wasn't the kind of thing</i>

55:24.653 --> 55:26.321
<i>that you brief
over the telephone,</i>

55:26.354 --> 55:30.325
<i>so they decided,
"We'll set up a briefing</i>

55:30.359 --> 55:32.862
<i>for the president
the day he gets back."</i>

55:32.894 --> 55:36.265
<i>Indian Prime Minister
Narendra Modi</i>

55:36.298 --> 55:38.867
<i>rolled out the red carpet
for President Trump.</i>

55:43.539 --> 55:46.176
Namaste.
Namaste.

55:49.211 --> 55:52.281
<i>President Trump often judges
events based on their size.</i>

55:52.314 --> 55:54.684
<i>The bigger the better,
so it's fitting</i>

55:54.716 --> 55:56.586
<i>that this stadium
was absolutely packed</i>

55:56.618 --> 55:59.856
<i>with more than 100,000 people.</i>

55:59.888 --> 56:01.223
The rally kicked off
a whirlwind trip

56:01.256 --> 56:04.461
<i>packed with the pageantry
that the president so loves.</i>

56:06.761 --> 56:11.401
<i>As of this morning,
we still have only 14 cases</i>

56:11.434 --> 56:13.303
of the China coronavirus

56:13.336 --> 56:15.705
detected here
in the United States.

56:15.738 --> 56:18.308
<i>We have three cases</i>

56:18.341 --> 56:20.843
<i>among Americans repatriated
from Wuhan,</i>

56:20.876 --> 56:24.781
<i>and we have 40 cases
among American passengers</i>

56:24.814 --> 56:28.818
<i>repatriated from the
"Diamond Princess" in Japan.</i>

56:28.850 --> 56:31.320
We're trying to engage
in radical transparency

56:31.354 --> 56:34.323
with the American public
as we go through this.

56:34.356 --> 56:36.325
This morning, Dr. Messonnier
from the CDC

56:36.359 --> 56:38.328
provided
the usual tele-briefing.

56:38.361 --> 56:39.796
<i>There was
a bit of confusion,</i>

56:39.828 --> 56:41.863
<i>and it was Nancy Messonnier's
understanding</i>

56:41.897 --> 56:45.001
that the green light
had been given

56:45.033 --> 56:46.903
for that new message

56:46.935 --> 56:50.339
to be delivered
before briefing the president.

56:50.372 --> 56:53.376
<i>So at her next conference call
for reporters,</i>

56:53.408 --> 56:56.680
she went to town.

57:12.662 --> 57:14.564
I remember being shocked,

57:14.597 --> 57:18.267
thinking, "Does she realize
what she just said?"

57:29.812 --> 57:31.981
<i>I can't say that I know</i>

57:32.013 --> 57:34.584
<i>what was
in Nancy Messonnier's mind,</i>

57:34.617 --> 57:37.754
<i>but it wouldn't be hard
to guess</i>

57:37.787 --> 57:39.922
<i>that there must have
been a level of frustration</i>

57:39.955 --> 57:42.292
built up inside the CDC

57:42.325 --> 57:45.995
about a president who
doesn't take this seriously.

57:46.028 --> 57:48.598
I mean, you know,
that was palpable.

57:55.004 --> 57:58.775
<i>Statements were made
for the first time</i>

57:58.807 --> 58:02.744
to prepare the psyche
of Americans

58:02.778 --> 58:06.316
for what we, the scientists,
knew was coming.

58:13.555 --> 58:17.359
<i>It was a turning point
in this outbreak</i>

58:17.392 --> 58:21.897
<i>because the truth was finally
broken through that shell</i>

58:21.930 --> 58:24.499
of so many people
standing there every day

58:24.533 --> 58:27.370
telling Americans,
"We have it under control.

58:27.403 --> 58:30.039
"We have it contained.
It's not a problem.

58:30.071 --> 58:31.673
It's going away."

58:31.707 --> 58:34.844
Those were the messages
every day up until that point.

58:41.649 --> 58:45.088
<i>She gives that briefing
at virtually the exact moment</i>

58:45.120 --> 58:47.022
<i>that Trump
is walking up the steps</i>

58:47.055 --> 58:48.957
<i>on "Air Force One" in India.</i>

58:48.990 --> 58:51.626
<i>On a larger scale,
communities and cities</i>

58:51.660 --> 58:55.464
<i>may need to modify, postpone,
or cancel mass gatherings.</i>

58:55.497 --> 58:58.400
Nancy Messonnier's comments
tank the market.

58:58.434 --> 59:00.769
1,000 point drop in the DOW.

59:00.803 --> 59:02.138
<i>Stocks fall sharply
as fears spread</i>

59:02.171 --> 59:05.808
that growing coronavirus
will slow the global economy.

59:05.841 --> 59:07.977
It was essentially
a kind of freak out.

59:08.010 --> 59:10.146
The stock market
taking another beating

59:10.178 --> 59:13.148
<i>after a sharp new warning
from the CDC.</i>

59:13.182 --> 59:14.183
<i>Also, tonight...</i>

59:14.216 --> 59:16.519
<i>Trump doesn't like
to be surprised.</i>

59:16.551 --> 59:19.622
<i>The one gleaming,
wonderful thing</i>

59:19.655 --> 59:23.459
<i>that was giving him and his
advisors hope was the economy.</i>

59:23.492 --> 59:25.160
It was the silver bullet.

59:25.193 --> 59:28.497
<i>That was how he was going
to win a second term.</i>

59:29.964 --> 59:33.403
<i>That, combined
with Messonnier's threat</i>

59:33.435 --> 59:37.039
<i>of what she was suggesting...
shut the country down...</i>

59:37.071 --> 59:38.840
<i>"You're saying something</i>

59:38.874 --> 59:40.910
<i>"that's gonna threaten
the economy,</i>

59:40.943 --> 59:44.513
and by definition,
threaten my reelection."

59:44.546 --> 59:46.548
<i>It's an 18-hour flight back.</i>

59:46.582 --> 59:48.651
<i>By the time Trump lands,</i>

59:48.684 --> 59:53.089
the whole thing had spun out
of control, and he was livid.

59:53.122 --> 59:56.192
<i>He calls up Alex Azar,
wakes him up,</i>

59:56.225 --> 59:58.694
<i>screaming at him...
what had happened?</i>

59:58.727 --> 59:59.728
<i>"Do you know Nancy Messonnier</i>

59:59.761 --> 01:00:02.564
<i>had scared the shit
out of people?"</i>

01:00:05.667 --> 01:00:08.771
The CDC said yesterday that
they believe it's inevitable

01:00:08.803 --> 01:00:10.872
that the virus will spread
in the United States,

01:00:10.906 --> 01:00:13.676
and it's not a question
of if, but when.

01:00:13.709 --> 01:00:15.477
Do you agree
with that assessment?

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:17.146
Whatever happens,
we're totally prepared.

01:00:17.178 --> 01:00:18.914
We have the best people
in the world.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:19.982
<i>Notably missing</i>

01:00:20.015 --> 01:00:21.850
<i>from "the best people
in the world"</i>

01:00:21.883 --> 01:00:24.453
<i>was Dr. Nancy Messonnier.</i>

01:00:24.486 --> 01:00:27.557
<i>It didn't surprise me
that the moment she said that,</i>

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:29.858
that she would be removed
from that platform.

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:33.995
I'm going to be announcing
exactly right now

01:00:34.028 --> 01:00:36.465
that I'm gonna be putting
our Vice President, Mike Pence,

01:00:36.499 --> 01:00:37.800
in charge.

01:00:37.832 --> 01:00:39.769
I'm gonna ask Mike Pence
to say a few words, please.

01:00:39.801 --> 01:00:42.004
Thank you.
Mike?

01:00:42.037 --> 01:00:43.805
<i>After the episode
with Nancy Messonnier,</i>

01:00:43.839 --> 01:00:47.243
<i>when Pence's team
takes over from Azar,</i>

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:50.780
essentially the message
gets contained.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.582
Not in the least.

01:00:53.615 --> 01:00:55.684
I was delighted that I get to
have the Vice President helping

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:56.752
in this way.

01:00:56.785 --> 01:00:58.754
Delighted.
Absolutely.

01:00:58.787 --> 01:01:00.823
<i>Now at the helm
of the task force,</i>

01:01:00.856 --> 01:01:02.258
<i>Pence promptly promoted
Deborah Birx,</i>

01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:06.495
<i>a doctor and a diplomat,
to be a spokesperson.</i>

01:01:06.528 --> 01:01:09.998
Dr. Birx, who is our right
arm at the White House on this,

01:01:10.031 --> 01:01:11.934
and frankly, one of the
leading experts in the world

01:01:11.966 --> 01:01:13.235
on infectious disease,
I think is...

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.671
<i>Pence trusted Birx</i>

01:01:14.703 --> 01:01:17.906
<i>on account of her Christian
faith and political instincts.</i>

01:01:17.939 --> 01:01:21.142
<i>She'd become a go-to-explainer
for a White House interested</i>

01:01:21.176 --> 01:01:24.280
<i>in packaging science
to serve partisan goals.</i>

01:01:24.312 --> 01:01:26.581
We really want
to understand

01:01:26.615 --> 01:01:29.584
where the virus is spreading,
who we have to protect,

01:01:29.618 --> 01:01:31.187
who's the most vulnerable.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.622
<i>That would have
been easy to understand</i>

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:36.158
<i>if there had been
a national testing program,</i>

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:38.294
<i>but that was still stalled.</i>

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.296
<i>While countries
all over the world</i>

01:01:40.328 --> 01:01:42.664
<i>were testing thousands
of cases,</i>

01:01:42.698 --> 01:01:46.002
<i>the United States was testing
fewer than 100 a day.</i>

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:49.605
<i>At that stage, the
only labs across the country</i>

01:01:49.638 --> 01:01:52.208
<i>that could legally test
for COVID</i>

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.643
<i>were a few
public health laboratories</i>

01:01:54.676 --> 01:01:56.178
and the CDC itself.

01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:59.582
<i>The frustration
was just boiling over,</i>

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.250
and I remember going
to these meetings

01:02:01.283 --> 01:02:03.118
with our clinical lab director,

01:02:03.151 --> 01:02:06.088
and she'sliterally on the
phone with the FDA and the CDC

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.890
like, "You need to help us!
You need to help us."

01:02:08.923 --> 01:02:11.126
<i>After almost a month</i>

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:14.062
<i>of labs across the country
being unable to test,</i>

01:02:14.095 --> 01:02:16.598
<i>the Trump Administration
finally made a decision</i>

01:02:16.631 --> 01:02:19.068
<i>it could have made
weeks earlier.</i>

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:21.836
<i>On February 26th,</i>

01:02:21.870 --> 01:02:25.775
the FDA and the CDC
laid out the strategy,

01:02:25.807 --> 01:02:28.243
and that was that we would
be able to get up and running

01:02:28.276 --> 01:02:30.879
by using the original test kit,

01:02:30.912 --> 01:02:35.150
<i>but by throwing out
the N3 component.</i>

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:36.819
<i>Overnight with, you know,</i>

01:02:36.852 --> 01:02:38.888
<i>with some crossing out
of lines on some paper,</i>

01:02:38.921 --> 01:02:41.691
<i>the same test kits
that had been shipped out</i>

01:02:41.723 --> 01:02:45.995
to the state public health
labs were functional.

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:49.231
<i>That amended EUA was
Wednesday, February 26th,</i>

01:02:49.263 --> 01:02:51.867
<i>and you can watch the testing
curve in the United States.</i>

01:02:51.899 --> 01:02:54.102
<i>I mean it really
didn't start going up</i>

01:02:54.135 --> 01:02:57.105
<i>until that week.</i>

01:02:57.138 --> 01:03:00.142
<i>Here in Washington State
at the state lab,</i>

01:03:00.175 --> 01:03:02.979
they had positive results
the very first time

01:03:03.011 --> 01:03:06.948
<i>they performed
authorized tests.</i>

01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:08.117
<i>After desperate pleas</i>

01:03:08.149 --> 01:03:09.751
<i>from health care providers,</i>

01:03:09.785 --> 01:03:12.754
<i>the FDA also relaxed
regulations and</i>

01:03:12.787 --> 01:03:16.992
<i>let manufacturers and hospital
labs use their own tests.</i>

01:03:17.026 --> 01:03:20.062
<i>But it was too little,
too late.</i>

01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:24.700
<i>The disease had spread to half
the states in the country.</i>

01:03:24.732 --> 01:03:27.636
<i>And test kits were
in such short supply</i>

01:03:27.669 --> 01:03:29.838
<i>that they were limited
to patients</i>

01:03:29.872 --> 01:03:33.743
<i>who met rigid guidelines
set by the CDC.</i>

01:03:33.776 --> 01:03:36.678
<i>Early on, our testing
was limited to people</i>

01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:40.115
<i>who had traveled from China,
or they had had contact</i>

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:43.685
<i>with someone who was known
tested positive for COVID-19.</i>

01:03:43.718 --> 01:03:45.854
<i>So written in our guidelines,</i>

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:49.158
<i>by necessity because we had
a strained testing supply,</i>

01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:51.827
it was designed to miss
community transmission,

01:03:51.859 --> 01:03:53.896
meaning transmission
that happens

01:03:53.928 --> 01:03:56.898
throughout the community
that's not connected to travel,

01:03:56.932 --> 01:03:59.267
that we know at some point's
gonna happen.

01:03:59.301 --> 01:04:02.271
And it's like we're
looking in this area,

01:04:02.303 --> 01:04:04.039
and we know that
transmission's gonna happen

01:04:04.073 --> 01:04:06.042
over here, and we're
gonna miss it

01:04:06.075 --> 01:04:07.376
because we can't test for it.

01:04:13.881 --> 01:04:15.984
<i>On February 27th,</i>

01:04:16.017 --> 01:04:19.220
<i>the new testing
recommendations came out.</i>

01:04:19.254 --> 01:04:20.456
Do you mind
removing the mask?

01:04:20.488 --> 01:04:22.323
- Is that okay?
- <i>Oh, no, not at all.</i>

01:04:22.356 --> 01:04:25.994
<i>Didn't know what your rules of
engagement were there, so...</i>

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:28.997
The new addition was
this line that said,

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:32.768
"If you have severe
lower respiratory pneumonia,

01:04:32.801 --> 01:04:35.037
<i>"severe pneumonia or ARDS...</i>

01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:37.439
<i>"Acute Respiratory
Distress Syndrome...</i>

01:04:37.472 --> 01:04:39.340
<i>you should consider testing."</i>

01:04:39.374 --> 01:04:41.477
<i>With the updated guidelines,</i>

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:44.479
we initiated testing
in two individuals,

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:47.783
and both of those individuals
tested positive.

01:04:47.816 --> 01:04:50.386
So that evening after
we got the first two back,

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:54.890
we looked around the
intensive care unit and said,

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:57.827
<i>"Okay, who else is sick
with pneumonia</i>

01:04:57.859 --> 01:04:59.729
<i>"that has not been diagnosed
with influenza</i>

01:04:59.761 --> 01:05:01.830
<i>or another respiratory virus?"</i>

01:05:01.863 --> 01:05:04.999
And we selected
nine more individuals.

01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:07.937
Eight of those turned out
to be positive for COVID.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:12.006
It was an astounding
revelation.

01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:14.843
<i>The revelation was
that while testing protocols</i>

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:18.881
<i>were on hold, the disease
had spread uncontrollably,</i>

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.915
<i>which would lead
to economic disaster</i>

01:05:20.948 --> 01:05:25.386
<i>and loss of tens of thousands
of lives.</i>

01:05:25.419 --> 01:05:28.857
<i>The real question is,
did more people die?</i>

01:05:28.890 --> 01:05:31.860
<i>Did more dislocation
and economic problems</i>

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:35.330
<i>and societal change
have to happen than did?</i>

01:05:35.363 --> 01:05:38.233
The period that
in our reporting

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:40.770
that we have called
"The Lost Month,"

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:44.006
<i>that really was the time</i>

01:05:44.039 --> 01:05:47.243
<i>when things happened
in the United States</i>

01:05:47.276 --> 01:05:50.111
<i>much more slowly
than they happened in,</i>

01:05:50.144 --> 01:05:51.546
<i>for example, South Korea,</i>

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.250
and it became impossible
to do containment.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:05:58.854
<i>Because the U.S.
failed to contain the virus,</i>

01:05:58.886 --> 01:06:00.388
<i>state governments
moved to lockdowns</i>

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:02.992
<i>to avoid runaway contagion</i>

01:06:03.024 --> 01:06:05.093
<i>and to prevent hospitals
from being overwhelmed.</i>

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:08.898
<i>Over 100,000 small businesses
would close and never reopen.</i>

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:13.068
<i>7 million Americans would be
infected by the disease.</i>

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:16.037
<i>But back in late February,
the government refused</i>

01:06:16.071 --> 01:06:18.540
<i>to confront the reckoning
that was about to come.</i>

01:06:18.573 --> 01:06:20.809
We have done
an incredible job.

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:22.511
We're going to continue.

01:06:22.544 --> 01:06:24.413
It's going to disappear
one day.

01:06:24.446 --> 01:06:26.482
It's like a miracle.
It will disappear.

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.417
<i>The president
is also quoted by saying,</i>

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:31.120
"The virus we're talking
about having to do,

01:06:31.153 --> 01:06:33.923
"you know, a lot of people
think it goes away in April

01:06:33.955 --> 01:06:35.089
with the heat."

01:06:35.122 --> 01:06:37.126
Dr. Fauci, does this go away
in April?

01:06:37.158 --> 01:06:39.127
If it acts like influenza,

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:42.497
the heat will actually make it
diminish in its impact,

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:45.334
but we have no way of knowing
how it's gonna act.

01:06:45.367 --> 01:06:48.403
Does the CDC agree
that this is a problem

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:51.040
that is going to go away
without intervention?

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.107
I think it's prudent
to assume

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:57.146
that this pathogen will be
with us for some time to come.

01:06:57.178 --> 01:06:59.514
The President's expressing
confidence this team,

01:06:59.548 --> 01:07:01.350
the public health
infrastructure in this country,

01:07:01.383 --> 01:07:03.419
state and local,
that we can deal with this.

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:06.287
We will prepare for this.
We will work together on this.

01:07:06.321 --> 01:07:08.223
He's trying to calm
a public that...

01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:11.392
we see in China, panic can be
as big of an enemy as virus

01:07:11.426 --> 01:07:12.595
in these situations,

01:07:12.627 --> 01:07:14.530
and so there is always
that balance to...

01:07:14.562 --> 01:07:16.999
Mr. Secretary, I don't want
to panic over this either.

01:07:17.031 --> 01:07:18.267
The stock market's crashing.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.635
He's outright contradicting

01:07:19.667 --> 01:07:22.037
everything that you all
have just said.

01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:23.305
Outright contradiction!

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:25.140
I think he's
expressing confidence in...

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:27.042
With no medical basis for it!

01:07:27.075 --> 01:07:28.377
That's what you've
just explained to us.

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:29.545
Come on, sir.

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:31.579
The gentleman's time
has expired.

01:07:31.613 --> 01:07:34.250
You're doing a great job for
the president, Mr. Secretary.

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:36.618
Now the Democrats are

01:07:36.651 --> 01:07:40.955
politicizing the coronavirus.

01:07:40.988 --> 01:07:43.124
You know that right?
Coronavirus.

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:48.330
One of my people came up
to me and said,

01:07:48.363 --> 01:07:51.332
"Mr. President,
they tried to beat you

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:53.001
"on Russia, Russia, Russia.

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:56.405
They tried
the impeachment hoax."

01:07:56.437 --> 01:07:59.073
And this is their new hoax.

01:07:59.106 --> 01:08:01.109
And so far,

01:08:01.142 --> 01:08:04.312
we have lost nobody
to coronavirus

01:08:04.345 --> 01:08:08.449
in the United States.

01:08:08.482 --> 01:08:10.986
Nobody.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:13.222
<i>The next day,
that would change.</i>

01:08:15.222 --> 01:08:18.026
Today, Public Health... Seattle
and King County... is announcing

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.363
three new presumptive positive
cases of novel coronavirus,

01:08:21.395 --> 01:08:24.631
COVID-19, including
one person who died.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:27.535
We have expressed
our condolences to the families

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.939
of the individual
who has passed away.

01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:32.106
<i>It was one of the first
two patients diagnosed,</i>

01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:35.477
<i>it was my patient,
and all we saw was a future</i>

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:39.448
<i>of extremely ill individuals
like this.</i>

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.115
So it was a challenging moment,

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.685
a daunting moment,
to come to that realization.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:47.288
Today, health officials
in Washington State

01:08:47.321 --> 01:08:50.658
announced four new deaths,
bringing the total to six,

01:08:50.691 --> 01:08:53.227
all in the Seattle area.

01:08:53.261 --> 01:08:55.464
<i>By early March,
King County, Washington</i>

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:58.499
<i>had become the epicenter
of the coronavirus in the U.S.</i>

01:08:58.533 --> 01:09:01.736
<i>due to the Lifecare
Nursing Home.</i>

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:04.406
They're not answering
the phones, the lines are busy.

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:07.475
<i>All the families
are really worried,</i>

01:09:07.508 --> 01:09:10.479
<i>not knowing if our loved ones
are even alive.</i>

01:09:10.511 --> 01:09:13.349
<i>It was a blur of activity.</i>

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:17.720
<i>We realized that our hospital</i>

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:21.090
<i>was now the tip
of the iceberg.</i>

01:09:21.122 --> 01:09:24.660
We soon found out
how deep that iceberg went.

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.995
<i>Because test kits
were in short supply,</i>

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.629
<i>access was limited to patients</i>

01:09:28.662 --> 01:09:32.667
<i>who were dangerously close
to respiratory failure.</i>

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:34.167
<i>The death count began to rise.</i>

01:09:34.202 --> 01:09:35.604
<i>COVID began spreading</i>

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:39.174
<i>to health care workers
and first responders.</i>

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:43.145
The job situation
put them at increased risk.

01:09:43.176 --> 01:09:47.148
<i>Nurses' aides in nursing homes</i>

01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.050
<i>without the protective
equipment or training</i>

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:51.252
<i>they needed
to be safe and secure.</i>

01:09:51.285 --> 01:09:53.787
<i>Individuals who have jobs</i>

01:09:53.821 --> 01:09:56.025
<i>that were considered
essential jobs,</i>

01:09:56.057 --> 01:09:58.359
<i>they're stocking
grocery shelves</i>

01:09:58.392 --> 01:10:01.396
<i>and helping to pick up trash
in communities</i>

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.700
<i>and sweep the streets.</i>

01:10:04.732 --> 01:10:06.368
<i>While many affluent Americans</i>

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.735
<i>worked on computers at home,</i>

01:10:07.769 --> 01:10:10.105
<i>low-paid essential workers,</i>

01:10:10.137 --> 01:10:12.807
<i>many without masks
and the ability to distance,</i>

01:10:12.841 --> 01:10:15.044
<i>were jammed
into sites of contagion</i>

01:10:15.077 --> 01:10:18.079
<i>like delivery depots,
industrial farms, factories,</i>

01:10:18.113 --> 01:10:21.383
<i>funeral homes,
and meatpacking plants.</i>

01:10:21.415 --> 01:10:24.686
<i>If the impact of the disease
was divided by occupation,</i>

01:10:24.718 --> 01:10:28.589
<i>it was also sundered
by age and race.</i>

01:10:28.623 --> 01:10:30.125
<i>My grandmother used to say,</i>

01:10:30.158 --> 01:10:31.593
"You know, when the country
gets the flu,

01:10:31.626 --> 01:10:33.294
black people get pneumonia."

01:10:33.328 --> 01:10:37.132
It's well-known in our circles
that we have worse outcomes

01:10:37.164 --> 01:10:39.834
when it comes to a lot
of these different diseases,

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:42.638
you know, and part of that
is systemic racism.

01:10:42.671 --> 01:10:45.574
A lot of it is
access to healthcare.

01:10:45.606 --> 01:10:48.077
<i>If you have the money, you
can get the best healthcare</i>

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:50.279
<i>in the world,
but without those resources,</i>

01:10:50.311 --> 01:10:54.315
<i>you have inadequate care
and sporadic care.</i>

01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:59.087
<i>So any kind of disease spread
then falls hardest</i>

01:10:59.120 --> 01:11:03.624
<i>on communities that
are already at a health risk.</i>

01:11:03.658 --> 01:11:05.394
<i>What are we dealing with?</i>

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:08.597
With this coronavirus,
COVID-19?

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:12.200
We're dealing with clearly
an emerging infectious disease

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:15.270
that has now reached
outbreak proportions

01:11:15.302 --> 01:11:17.172
and likely
pandemic proportions.

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:24.480
<i>The "Grand Princess"
Cruise Ship has been moored</i>

01:11:24.512 --> 01:11:26.214
<i>off the coast of California.</i>

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:29.451
<i>I want to commend the efforts
of our Coast Guard</i>

01:11:29.484 --> 01:11:32.588
<i>that heroically flew
coronavirus tests</i>

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:34.455
<i>to the ship.</i>

01:11:34.489 --> 01:11:38.160
21 tested positive
for the coronavirus.

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:41.329
<i>On his way
to a weekend trip</i>

01:11:41.363 --> 01:11:45.267
<i>to Mar-a-Lago,
Trump made a stop at the CDC.</i>

01:11:45.300 --> 01:11:47.235
<i>Watching the president go</i>

01:11:47.269 --> 01:11:50.305
<i>to the Centers
for Disease Control,</i>

01:11:50.337 --> 01:11:53.341
he discussed with a reporter

01:11:53.374 --> 01:11:56.544
the fact that one of the cruise
ships was still offshore.

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:59.381
<i>I'd rather have them stay on</i>

01:11:59.413 --> 01:12:01.516
because I like the numbers
being where they are.

01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:04.418
I don't need to have
the numbers double

01:12:04.452 --> 01:12:06.254
because of one ship.

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:09.758
<i>For the first time,
it occurred to me</i>

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:11.325
that the government
of the United States

01:12:11.359 --> 01:12:14.829
was intentionally
slow walking testing.

01:12:14.863 --> 01:12:17.466
In this big vast land
of ours,

01:12:17.498 --> 01:12:21.336
this great country of ours,
we have 240 cases.

01:12:21.369 --> 01:12:23.672
Most of those people
are gonna be fine.

01:12:23.704 --> 01:12:25.439
The vast majority
are going to be fine.

01:12:25.472 --> 01:12:27.208
We've had 11 deaths.

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.177
All of our state labs

01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:31.312
now have the ability
to test for this virus...

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:32.513
And they have had.

01:12:32.547 --> 01:12:34.216
The testing has been
amazing, actually,

01:12:34.248 --> 01:12:35.383
what they've been able
to produce

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.352
in such a short period of time.

01:12:37.385 --> 01:12:40.289
Anybody that wants a test
can get a test.

01:12:40.321 --> 01:12:43.357
<i>Anybody who wanted
a test knew that was a lie.</i>

01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:45.494
<i>Just finding a facility
was hard.</i>

01:12:45.526 --> 01:12:47.462
<i>People with the disease
were denied tests</i>

01:12:47.494 --> 01:12:49.297
<i>on account of supply backlogs,</i>

01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.767
<i>which also caused delays
in results.</i>

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:55.303
<i>The next day,
while Trump golfed,</i>

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:57.873
<i>Pence and Redfield went
to Cruise Lines of America.</i>

01:12:57.905 --> 01:13:00.309
<i>We all recognize
the recent challenges</i>

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:01.977
<i>on the "Diamond Princess,"</i>

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:04.780
<i>and the ongoing challenge
with the "Grand Princess,"</i>

01:13:04.812 --> 01:13:06.614
and we want to ensure
that the American people

01:13:06.647 --> 01:13:10.351
can continue as we deal
with the coronavirus

01:13:10.385 --> 01:13:13.321
to enjoy the opportunities
in the cruise line industry

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.723
and be confident.

01:13:14.756 --> 01:13:16.557
I would not encourage anyone

01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:18.459
to change their plans
at this point

01:13:18.493 --> 01:13:21.830
based on what the epidemiology
is here in Florida.

01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:23.332
They should enjoy Disneyland.

01:13:23.364 --> 01:13:25.666
They should enjoy
the rest of Florida.

01:13:25.699 --> 01:13:27.868
<i>There is this
back and forth,</i>

01:13:27.901 --> 01:13:29.837
the medical folks saying
we need to take this seriously,

01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:31.573
we need to be aggressive,

01:13:31.605 --> 01:13:33.774
the economic folks pushing back
and saying, "Yeah, but..."

01:13:33.807 --> 01:13:35.877
<i>Fauci would march up
and answer questions.</i>

01:13:35.909 --> 01:13:37.912
Do you believe that people,

01:13:37.945 --> 01:13:41.315
even if they're healthy, should
get onboard a cruise ship?

01:13:41.348 --> 01:13:42.618
I would recommend strongly

01:13:42.650 --> 01:13:44.885
that they do not
go on a cruise ship.

01:13:44.918 --> 01:13:47.756
And then Trump or Pence
would come back

01:13:47.788 --> 01:13:49.357
and sort of contradict him.

01:13:49.391 --> 01:13:51.026
We're gonna work
with the cruise line industry

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:53.361
to improve the safety,

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:56.265
improve the health environment
on cruise lines.

01:13:56.297 --> 01:13:58.899
Frankly, the testing
has been going very smooth.

01:13:58.932 --> 01:14:00.901
If you go to the right agency,

01:14:00.935 --> 01:14:03.004
if you go to the right area,
you get the test.

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:04.772
Will you admit that
there is a serious problem

01:14:04.806 --> 01:14:06.040
in this country

01:14:06.074 --> 01:14:10.012
obtaining access to testing
for coronavirus?

01:14:10.044 --> 01:14:12.681
My colleague is looking at me
to answer that.

01:14:12.713 --> 01:14:14.783
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:14:14.815 --> 01:14:16.818
The system
is not really geared

01:14:16.851 --> 01:14:19.321
to what we need right now.

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.722
- That is a failing.
- A failing, yes.

01:14:21.756 --> 01:14:23.691
It is a failing.
Let's admit it.

01:14:23.725 --> 01:14:26.061
Dr. Fauci said
earlier this week

01:14:26.093 --> 01:14:28.997
that the lag in testing
was, in fact, a failing.

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:31.032
Do you take responsibility
for that?

01:14:31.065 --> 01:14:33.068
Yeah, no, I don't take
responsibility at all.

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.636
We're doing a great job.

01:14:34.668 --> 01:14:36.771
Yeah, we have 40 people
right now... 40.

01:14:36.805 --> 01:14:38.339
Compare that
with other countries

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:40.409
that have many, many times
that amount.

01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:44.946
<i>To keep new cases
from entering our shores,</i>

01:14:44.979 --> 01:14:48.717
<i>we will be suspending
all travel from Europe</i>

01:14:48.749 --> 01:14:51.419
to the United States
for the next 30 days.

01:14:52.854 --> 01:14:53.821
<i>There was a problem</i>

01:14:53.855 --> 01:14:55.557
<i>with Trump's
sudden travel ban...</i>

01:14:55.589 --> 01:14:57.993
<i>it had no plan attached.</i>

01:14:58.025 --> 01:15:00.494
If we do get back
to the U.S., then what happens?

01:15:00.528 --> 01:15:04.665
<i>Do we go into quarantine?
Do we go home?</i>

01:15:04.699 --> 01:15:06.935
<i>Returning Americans
flooded U.S. airports,</i>

01:15:06.967 --> 01:15:10.671
<i>where they were jammed in
makeshift COVID checkpoints.</i>

01:15:10.704 --> 01:15:13.607
<i>They were perfect conditions
for more contagion,</i>

01:15:13.641 --> 01:15:17.479
<i>as travelers from Europe
spread the virus into the U.S.</i>

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:29.458
<i>The message to New Yorkers
from the beginning has been,</i>

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.560
<i>"This is something
we all can handle together.</i>

01:15:31.592 --> 01:15:33.595
Go about your lives.
Go about your business."

01:15:36.998 --> 01:15:38.700
<i>The Governor confirming</i>

01:15:38.732 --> 01:15:42.070
<i>that coronavirus has arrived
here in Manhattan.</i>

01:15:42.102 --> 01:15:45.473
<i>The coronavirus spreads
tonight as Governor Cuomo</i>

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:48.944
<i>announces five more
positive cases in New York.</i>

01:15:53.614 --> 01:15:56.484
<i>The number of confirmed
cases has reached 121.</i>

01:15:56.517 --> 01:15:58.986
<i>Today, Governor Cuomo
announcing a ban</i>

01:15:59.020 --> 01:16:01.990
<i>on any gatherings
of 500 people or more.</i>

01:16:02.022 --> 01:16:05.560
<i>And 613 confirmed cases
of coronavirus in New York.</i>

01:16:05.592 --> 01:16:08.896
<i>That is more
than any other state.</i>

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.566
I'm glad to see that you're
practicing social distancing.

01:16:11.598 --> 01:16:13.435
That looks very nice.

01:16:13.467 --> 01:16:16.604
We're announcing new guidelines
for every American to follow.

01:16:16.637 --> 01:16:19.640
<i>Avoid gathering in groups
of more than 10 people,</i>

01:16:19.673 --> 01:16:23.544
<i>and avoid eating and drinking
in bars, restaurants.</i>

01:16:23.578 --> 01:16:25.914
And if everybody in America
does what we ask for,

01:16:25.946 --> 01:16:27.815
<i>we will see
a dramatic difference,</i>

01:16:27.848 --> 01:16:29.717
<i>and we won't have to worry
about the ventilators,</i>

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:31.753
<i>and we won't have to worry
about the ICU beds.</i>

01:16:31.785 --> 01:16:34.955
Our volume
is just exploding.

01:16:34.989 --> 01:16:37.459
<i>We have so many people
in the hallways.</i>

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:41.430
<i>A day or so ago, we put
14 people on ventilators.</i>

01:16:41.462 --> 01:16:45.065
<i>Mayor de Blasio says that
there have been 100 new cases</i>

01:16:45.098 --> 01:16:46.868
<i>in the city today alone.</i>

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:49.437
<i>So we're going to put out
an executive order today.</i>

01:16:49.471 --> 01:16:52.207
<i>New York State on pause.</i>

01:16:52.239 --> 01:16:54.074
<i>19 million New Yorkers are
being asked to stay at home</i>

01:16:54.107 --> 01:16:55.577
<i>as much as possible.</i>

01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:58.079
<i>Now topping
85,000 confirmed cases</i>

01:16:58.111 --> 01:17:00.214
<i>and more than 1,400 deaths.</i>

01:17:00.248 --> 01:17:02.784
<i>I hate to say this,
but it's true...</i>

01:17:02.816 --> 01:17:05.553
we are now the epicenter
of this crisis

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:08.223
<i>right here
in the nation's largest city.</i>

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:12.494
<i>And if this goes on for
a month, or two, or three,</i>

01:17:12.526 --> 01:17:16.564
<i>or five like it did in China,
we don't have what we need.</i>

01:17:18.199 --> 01:17:21.236
<i>This is not a country that
was built to be shut down.</i>

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:24.573
<i>We're not gonna let the cure
be worse than the problem.</i>

01:17:24.605 --> 01:17:26.774
<i>Worried about the economy,</i>

01:17:26.807 --> 01:17:28.877
<i>Trump tried
to limit shutdowns,</i>

01:17:28.909 --> 01:17:31.245
<i>but the virus
was out of control.</i>

01:17:31.279 --> 01:17:34.216
<i>By April, over 3,000
New Yorkers had died,</i>

01:17:34.248 --> 01:17:37.218
<i>surpassing the death toll
of 9/11.</i>

01:17:37.252 --> 01:17:41.189
<i>ICUs were over capacity with
patients who couldn't breathe.</i>

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:43.724
<i>Ventilators were
in short supply,</i>

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:47.128
<i>and many of those who got them
did not survive.</i>

01:17:50.064 --> 01:17:51.600
<i>We had seen the pandemic</i>

01:17:51.632 --> 01:17:54.101
<i>was really taking off
in New York City.</i>

01:17:54.135 --> 01:17:56.238
<i>We were in a central area
of Virginia</i>

01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:58.706
<i>where there's not
a huge population,</i>

01:17:58.739 --> 01:18:01.075
<i>and it was like being
on a coastal city</i>

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:02.744
<i>and you hear
about an earthquake</i>

01:18:02.776 --> 01:18:04.512
<i>that happens offshore.</i>

01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:06.780
You know that
a tsunami is coming.

01:18:06.814 --> 01:18:08.682
You just don't know
when it's gonna happen

01:18:08.716 --> 01:18:11.887
and how severe it's gonna be.

01:18:11.919 --> 01:18:13.721
<i>A U.S. Marine in Virginia</i>

01:18:13.754 --> 01:18:16.223
<i>has tested positive
for the coronavirus.</i>

01:18:16.257 --> 01:18:18.960
<i>This is the first
positive case in Virginia,</i>

01:18:18.993 --> 01:18:20.328
<i>and here's what we know.</i>

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:24.031
<i>I remember one day, I was
rounding in our COVID ICU,</i>

01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:27.168
and our unit is structured
kind of like a V,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.006
<i>so there's one wing here,
another wing over there.</i>

01:18:31.038 --> 01:18:32.640
<i>And you know, these are some
of the sickest patients</i>

01:18:32.673 --> 01:18:33.908
<i>I've ever taken care of
in my life.</i>

01:18:33.941 --> 01:18:36.243
<i>They're on breathing machines,
dialysis machines.</i>

01:18:36.276 --> 01:18:37.678
<i>They are needing
lots of medicines</i>

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:40.915
<i>to keep them sedated and calm.</i>

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:43.084
<i>And I'm trying to get
through morning rounds,</i>

01:18:43.117 --> 01:18:44.753
<i>and I see that on one wing,</i>

01:18:44.785 --> 01:18:48.323
<i>it's almost
all Hispanic last names.</i>

01:18:48.355 --> 01:18:50.024
<i>And then, on the other wing,</i>

01:18:50.057 --> 01:18:53.662
<i>it's almost all Black names.</i>

01:18:53.695 --> 01:18:57.198
<i>I grew up an hour away
from where I'm working.</i>

01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:59.600
<i>These are the family names
that I grew up with,</i>

01:18:59.633 --> 01:19:02.069
<i>and I know these families.</i>

01:19:02.102 --> 01:19:04.806
And I just was trying
to focus on the medical part

01:19:04.838 --> 01:19:06.040
and just getting through it,

01:19:06.074 --> 01:19:09.077
but I just felt this weight
on my chest.

01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:11.713
<i>I'm a Black male
in the United States</i>

01:19:11.745 --> 01:19:13.847
<i>and my family members
have chronic diseases</i>

01:19:13.881 --> 01:19:15.650
<i>at high rates,</i>

01:19:15.682 --> 01:19:17.953
<i>and I've been dealing
with this my whole life.</i>

01:19:17.985 --> 01:19:21.288
And now I have family members
who are contracting COVID.

01:19:21.321 --> 01:19:25.226
<i>Those are smiles and hugs
and tears and barbeques.</i>

01:19:25.258 --> 01:19:28.329
<i>They're not numbers
on a paper.</i>

01:19:28.363 --> 01:19:30.198
<i>Through the spring,</i>

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:33.068
<i>the death toll would rise
to 100,000.</i>

01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.769
<i>It was a terrifying marker</i>

01:19:34.802 --> 01:19:37.672
<i>for the failure
of the American response.</i>

01:19:37.704 --> 01:19:40.742
<i>The U.S. was 4%
of the world's population</i>

01:19:40.775 --> 01:19:44.379
<i>and 20% of the deaths
from the virus.</i>

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:47.248
<i>Despite the fatal consequences
of inaction,</i>

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.818
<i>the government could not solve
basic problems</i>

01:19:49.851 --> 01:19:52.020
<i>like supplies for test kits.</i>

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:58.827
<i>In March, we started to see
the global supply chain</i>

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:00.929
really get jammed up.

01:20:00.962 --> 01:20:05.834
So it was extraction kits,
swabs.

01:20:05.867 --> 01:20:08.970
<i>The major producer of swabs</i>

01:20:09.003 --> 01:20:10.939
is in the Lombardy region
of Italy.

01:20:10.971 --> 01:20:14.008
<i>And Italy had just gone
on lockdown,</i>

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:17.678
<i>and the swabs company
was in a no-fly zone,</i>

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.414
so the U.S. supply
is basically going...

01:20:19.446 --> 01:20:21.149
grinding to a halt.

01:20:21.181 --> 01:20:25.753
Every single step of the way,
we've encountered an issue

01:20:25.787 --> 01:20:28.390
or a problem
with the supply chain.

01:20:28.422 --> 01:20:30.992
<i>Potential supply chain
problems</i>

01:20:31.025 --> 01:20:34.796
<i>had been identified
in "Crimson Contagion."</i>

01:20:34.829 --> 01:20:38.033
<i>The focus was on testing
supplies and lifesaving PPE.</i>

01:20:38.065 --> 01:20:41.269
<i>The most critical items needed
were N95 masks,</i>

01:20:41.302 --> 01:20:44.005
<i>whose firm fit and tight mesh
offered healthcare workers</i>

01:20:44.038 --> 01:20:48.043
<i>real protection
from the disease.</i>

01:20:48.075 --> 01:20:51.311
We had estimated the number
of N95 respirators

01:20:51.345 --> 01:20:53.847
<i>that would be needed.</i>

01:20:53.881 --> 01:20:57.718
That number was 3 1/2 billion.

01:20:57.752 --> 01:21:00.321
<i>And we had a fraction</i>

01:21:00.354 --> 01:21:02.790
<i>of what we would need
in the stockpile.</i>

01:21:02.824 --> 01:21:05.427
<i>And all of those had
a five-year shelf life,</i>

01:21:05.459 --> 01:21:07.761
<i>and a lot of those,</i>

01:21:07.794 --> 01:21:11.899
they were purchased
almost ten years ago.

01:21:11.932 --> 01:21:15.903
<i>Despite Ebola,
despite Zika, despite H1N1,</i>

01:21:15.936 --> 01:21:18.939
filling up the national
stockpile for some virus

01:21:18.972 --> 01:21:21.075
<i>that we don't even know
is ever gonna come</i>

01:21:21.109 --> 01:21:24.245
<i>has never been
the top priority.</i>

01:21:24.278 --> 01:21:26.815
You can say the Obama
Administration didn't do enough

01:21:26.847 --> 01:21:29.450
<i>to leave the next
administration prepared.</i>

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:31.419
<i>You can also say,
"Well, that's true,</i>

01:21:31.452 --> 01:21:36.024
<i>but the Trump Administration
had three and a half years."</i>

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:38.358
<i>The Strategic National
Stockpile was not intended</i>

01:21:38.391 --> 01:21:42.730
to be everything that we would
need for an entire crisis.

01:21:42.763 --> 01:21:45.333
<i>I think in mid-January,
the U.S. government</i>

01:21:45.365 --> 01:21:47.401
<i>should have been looking
at the stockpile</i>

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:48.669
<i>to see what was in it</i>

01:21:48.703 --> 01:21:52.906
<i>and how we were gonna pivot
to manufacture more.</i>

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.509
We should have been
having the conversation

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:57.979
about the Defense
Production Act in January.

01:21:58.012 --> 01:22:00.381
There's talk
of invoking war powers

01:22:00.413 --> 01:22:04.852
to require U.S. companies
to manufacture some goods.

01:22:04.886 --> 01:22:06.087
That's right,

01:22:06.119 --> 01:22:07.788
so that's called
the Defense Production Act.

01:22:07.821 --> 01:22:08.922
I believe it came
into existence

01:22:08.955 --> 01:22:10.024
during the Korean War.

01:22:10.056 --> 01:22:12.793
<i>Effectively, we can determine</i>

01:22:12.827 --> 01:22:15.129
<i>that our production should get
to the front of the line.</i>

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:17.464
<i>We'll use it if we need to,
but we obviously...</i>

01:22:17.498 --> 01:22:19.534
if we can work cooperatively
with any vendor,

01:22:19.566 --> 01:22:21.435
we'd rather do that.

01:22:21.468 --> 01:22:24.004
<i>"Let the market
work its magic."</i>

01:22:24.038 --> 01:22:27.107
<i>That was the guiding
philosophy for Azar and Trump,</i>

01:22:27.141 --> 01:22:29.310
<i>but their anti-government
strategy</i>

01:22:29.342 --> 01:22:33.180
<i>ignored basic rules
of supply and demand.</i>

01:22:33.213 --> 01:22:37.118
<i>Without a large order from
the United States government,</i>

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.119
there really wasn't an
incentive for these companies

01:22:39.153 --> 01:22:42.190
to start maximizing
their throughput.

01:22:42.222 --> 01:22:46.293
<i>I was getting reports from
Mike Bowen, one of the few</i>

01:22:46.327 --> 01:22:49.364
<i>remaining producers
of face masks and respirators</i>

01:22:49.396 --> 01:22:51.031
<i>in the United States</i>

01:22:51.065 --> 01:22:54.903
who had his finger on the pulse
of the supply chain.

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:59.274
<i>I'm a salesman telling
a story that nobody believes.</i>

01:22:59.306 --> 01:23:02.075
The story is that the U.S.
mask supply is gonna collapse

01:23:02.109 --> 01:23:03.244
and people are gonna die.

01:23:03.276 --> 01:23:05.279
It doesn't cost much to fix.

01:23:05.312 --> 01:23:08.216
That's the story.

01:23:08.248 --> 01:23:12.986
<i>Around 2005, all of the major
mask makers left the country.</i>

01:23:13.020 --> 01:23:15.824
It put the U.S. mask supply

01:23:15.856 --> 01:23:17.457
in the hands of foreign control

01:23:17.490 --> 01:23:20.961
and could be subject to
diversion during a pandemic.

01:23:20.994 --> 01:23:23.430
<i>And that's what I've been
warning about for years.</i>

01:23:23.463 --> 01:23:25.867
<i>I wrote Barack Obama
20 letters.</i>

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.937
<i>"Tell America's hospitals
that they are going to be</i>

01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:30.571
"in a position to not be
able to protect their staff

01:23:30.605 --> 01:23:31.573
and their patients."

01:23:31.605 --> 01:23:34.309
I voted for Donald Trump.

01:23:34.342 --> 01:23:37.345
<i>I thought, "You know,
if I contact enough people</i>

01:23:37.378 --> 01:23:39.914
<i>"in the administration,
somebody, one of these people</i>

01:23:39.946 --> 01:23:41.882
"are gonna look at this and go,
'Hey, this is a problem.

01:23:41.915 --> 01:23:43.217
Maybe we ought
to call this guy.'"

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:45.285
And no, I couldn't get any...

01:23:45.319 --> 01:23:47.622
I didn't get
any response there.

01:23:47.654 --> 01:23:51.124
<i>In January,
Bowen's predictions came true.</i>

01:23:51.158 --> 01:23:53.494
<i>As China struggled to contain
the outbreak of COVID,</i>

01:23:53.526 --> 01:23:58.165
<i>it limited the export of N95
masks to the United States.</i>

01:23:58.199 --> 01:23:59.968
<i>At the end of January,</i>

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:01.369
<i>I'm hearing
from all over the world.</i>

01:24:01.403 --> 01:24:05.240
<i>People are freaking out about
masks, and needing masks.</i>

01:24:05.272 --> 01:24:06.908
And that's when I got ahold
of Rick and said,

01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.376
"Hey, here's what
I'm seeing out here.

01:24:08.409 --> 01:24:10.411
This is gonna be bad."

01:24:10.444 --> 01:24:14.382
<i>He was sounding the
alarm bells almost every day.</i>

01:24:14.414 --> 01:24:16.917
<i>We can't protect
America's population.</i>

01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:19.253
<i>That's too late, but I said
I can at least make</i>

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:22.222
enough masks to protect
America's healthcare workers.

01:24:22.256 --> 01:24:26.261
<i>I reminded him that we had
these four respirator lines.</i>

01:24:26.293 --> 01:24:30.163
<i>To activate them we would need
more people, raw materials,</i>

01:24:30.196 --> 01:24:34.334
<i>emergency NIOSH approval, and
large non-cancellable orders.</i>

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:36.370
I see that our country's
gonna have a problem,

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:37.605
I get ahold of Rick.

01:24:37.637 --> 01:24:40.073
I pushed every one
of those emails

01:24:40.106 --> 01:24:42.109
up to the Strategic
National Stockpile

01:24:42.142 --> 01:24:44.645
<i>and Critical
Infrastructure Team.</i>

01:24:44.678 --> 01:24:49.316
<i>I reminded them
of the H5N1 scare,</i>

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:54.088
when people rushed to buy
masks and hoard masks.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:56.524
<i>The response I got was,</i>

01:24:56.556 --> 01:25:00.127
"We will just change
the CDC guideline.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:04.631
<i>And we'll just tell people,
don't do that."</i>

01:25:04.664 --> 01:25:06.600
<i>Basically in March,
they realized</i>

01:25:06.633 --> 01:25:08.235
that the healthcare workers

01:25:08.269 --> 01:25:10.305
are not going
to have enough PPE,

01:25:10.337 --> 01:25:13.440
so they basically issued
a warning to the public,

01:25:13.473 --> 01:25:17.011
<i>"Do not use face masks."</i>

01:25:17.043 --> 01:25:20.514
Do you have any sense
of how many more N95 masks

01:25:20.547 --> 01:25:23.617
would be on the market had the
federal government taken you up

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:27.187
on your offer to reactivate
N95 manufacturing lines

01:25:27.221 --> 01:25:28.589
in January?

01:25:28.622 --> 01:25:32.592
About 7 million
N95 respirators per month.

01:25:32.626 --> 01:25:34.995
I sounded the alarm every day

01:25:35.029 --> 01:25:38.732
about the shortage
of N95 respirators,

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:41.336
<i>and we were doing nothing.</i>

01:25:41.369 --> 01:25:43.705
<i>The numbers continue
to surge in hotspots</i>

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:47.275
<i>like California, Michigan,
Louisiana, Florida,</i>

01:25:47.307 --> 01:25:49.243
<i>and especially,
of course, New York.</i>

01:25:49.275 --> 01:25:51.979
<i>Medical resources
are stretched to capacity</i>

01:25:52.012 --> 01:25:53.381
<i>and beyond.</i>

01:25:57.217 --> 01:26:01.122
We had saved
some outdated N95 masks

01:26:01.154 --> 01:26:03.323
that were part
of the Ebola response,

01:26:03.356 --> 01:26:05.659
<i>but quickly we ran out
of those supplies,</i>

01:26:05.693 --> 01:26:09.629
<i>so we had to make do.</i>

01:26:09.663 --> 01:26:12.200
<i>Some of the N95 masks
that we received</i>

01:26:12.232 --> 01:26:14.502
had been in storage
for years and years,

01:26:14.534 --> 01:26:17.104
and while the actual
mask itself worked fine,

01:26:17.137 --> 01:26:18.772
the rubber band was brittle.

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:21.109
<i>So there were people
in the room</i>

01:26:21.141 --> 01:26:25.178
<i>taking care of a patient,
and the mask just snaps off.</i>

01:26:25.212 --> 01:26:27.714
<i>The CDC is now
advising healthcare workers</i>

01:26:27.748 --> 01:26:30.585
<i>to ration masks,
to use expired masks,</i>

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:33.588
<i>even use bandanas or scarves
as a last resort.</i>

01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:40.395
<i>Our usage increased
by several hundredfold.</i>

01:26:40.427 --> 01:26:44.664
We could see our equipment
supply going down dramatically.

01:26:44.698 --> 01:26:47.635
<i>So you kind of clamp down a
little bit and say, you know,</i>

01:26:47.668 --> 01:26:51.339
<i>"We're gonna save it for these
very specific encounters."</i>

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:53.708
So now, from the perspective
of a healthcare worker,

01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:56.077
you're taking away my safety.

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:59.313
<i>And what people really
wanted was a big enough supply</i>

01:26:59.346 --> 01:27:02.183
<i>so that anyone who felt that
they were at a higher risk</i>

01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:03.685
<i>could be safe.</i>

01:27:10.356 --> 01:27:15.162
<i>One mask to be worn
for 12 hours.</i>

01:27:15.195 --> 01:27:16.730
It's just ridiculous.

01:27:16.763 --> 01:27:19.600
No protective equipment,
the gowns.

01:27:19.632 --> 01:27:22.336
<i>We have to improvise
with what we have.</i>

01:27:24.805 --> 01:27:27.175
We have people coming in
sewing masks, sewing shields,

01:27:27.208 --> 01:27:29.544
making things out of plastics.

01:27:29.577 --> 01:27:31.712
This is what we're doing now?

01:27:31.744 --> 01:27:33.413
<i>I mean that would be like
a soldier going to war</i>

01:27:33.446 --> 01:27:35.283
<i>and making a plastic gun
to bring with him.</i>

01:27:35.315 --> 01:27:37.151
<i>This is what's happening.</i>

01:27:47.194 --> 01:27:49.297
- PPEs!
- Every day!

01:27:49.329 --> 01:27:50.464
PPEs!

01:27:50.498 --> 01:27:52.200
Every day!

01:27:52.232 --> 01:27:55.436
<i>We're here in the community
fighting every day,</i>

01:27:55.468 --> 01:27:59.573
and we need some help.

01:27:59.606 --> 01:28:02.577
<i>In February, the
Trump Administration actually</i>

01:28:02.610 --> 01:28:05.446
<i>created the China-COVID
Procurement Service</i>

01:28:05.479 --> 01:28:08.415
<i>to encourage
American producers like 3M</i>

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:11.486
<i>to sell their entire
inventories of N95 masks</i>

01:28:11.519 --> 01:28:14.122
<i>to China.</i>

01:28:14.154 --> 01:28:17.157
<i>When American hospitals
desperately needed N95s,</i>

01:28:17.190 --> 01:28:18.758
<i>they were forced
to import them</i>

01:28:18.792 --> 01:28:20.561
<i>and pay up to 10 times more</i>

01:28:20.593 --> 01:28:23.631
<i>than the price charged
by American producers.</i>

01:28:23.663 --> 01:28:27.734
<i>PPE has been sporadic,
but we do what we have to do.</i>

01:28:27.767 --> 01:28:30.203
<i>We're nurses,
and we learn to adapt</i>

01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:32.739
and to get the job done
and get the care provided,

01:28:32.772 --> 01:28:34.441
and that's what
we're gonna continue to do.

01:28:34.475 --> 01:28:35.642
Sporadic for you,

01:28:35.676 --> 01:28:37.712
but not sporadic
for a lot of other people.

01:28:37.744 --> 01:28:38.912
Oh, no, I agree,
Mr. President.

01:28:38.945 --> 01:28:40.547
Because I've heard
the opposite.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.252
I've heard that they are
loaded up with gowns now.

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:46.319
And you know, initially,
we had nothing.

01:28:46.352 --> 01:28:49.257
We had empty cupboards.
We had empty shelves.

01:28:49.289 --> 01:28:51.525
We had nothing because
it wasn't put there

01:28:51.559 --> 01:28:53.427
by the last administration.

01:28:53.459 --> 01:28:55.562
<i>In the midst of the crisis,</i>

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.899
<i>President Trump goes on TV
and says, "Don't worry.</i>

01:28:57.931 --> 01:29:00.367
<i>We've got plenty of PPE
for healthcare workers."</i>

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:03.303
<i>What was your reaction
when you saw that?</i>

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:05.506
I know what
my reaction was.

01:29:05.538 --> 01:29:08.275
I turned to my wife and said,
"That's complete bullshit.

01:29:08.309 --> 01:29:11.244
He has no idea
what he's talking about."

01:29:11.278 --> 01:29:14.515
I'm getting 500
to 1,000 emails a day.

01:29:14.547 --> 01:29:18.351
I'm getting emails from people,
not businesses.

01:29:18.385 --> 01:29:20.387
I'm getting emails from moms.

01:29:20.421 --> 01:29:23.624
I'm getting emails from old
people, "Please send me masks."

01:29:26.694 --> 01:29:30.531
And I can't.

01:29:30.564 --> 01:29:32.499
You make a product
that can protect people.

01:29:32.533 --> 01:29:35.203
I can't help
all these people.

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:41.876
<i>The PPE shortage
continued on for months,</i>

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.312
<i>even after Trump put
one of his most trusted</i>

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:45.913
<i>family members in charge</i>

01:29:45.945 --> 01:29:48.248
<i>of procuring
protective equipment.</i>

01:29:51.318 --> 01:29:53.486
<i>Jared Kushner formed
his own task force</i>

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:54.821
<i>to get supplies.</i>

01:29:54.855 --> 01:29:56.857
<i>Was that confusing?
Like did you...</i>

01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:58.726
It was extremely confusing.

01:29:58.758 --> 01:30:00.328
The president
wanted to make sure

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.562
that we had the best people
doing the best jobs

01:30:02.596 --> 01:30:05.299
and making sure that we had
the right people focused

01:30:05.332 --> 01:30:06.901
on all the things
that needed to happen

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:09.669
to make sure that we can
deliver in these unusual times

01:30:09.703 --> 01:30:12.839
<i>for the American people.</i>

01:30:12.873 --> 01:30:15.576
<i>My old boss called me
and said he heard that</i>

01:30:15.609 --> 01:30:19.347
<i>Jared Kushner's task force
needed younger volunteers</i>

01:30:19.379 --> 01:30:21.281
who had general skills
and were willing

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:24.352
to work seven days a week
for no money,

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:27.454
and if you fit those criteria,
that you should head to D.C.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:31.458
and help
with the pandemic response.

01:30:31.492 --> 01:30:33.261
<i>I definitely
had some apprehension</i>

01:30:33.293 --> 01:30:34.595
<i>about working
for the administration,</i>

01:30:34.628 --> 01:30:36.364
<i>but it felt like the country</i>

01:30:36.396 --> 01:30:38.431
and the world
were under attack.

01:30:38.464 --> 01:30:40.935
It seemed like if there
was something to do to help,

01:30:40.967 --> 01:30:43.703
that was the right thing to do.

01:30:43.736 --> 01:30:45.373
<i>They basically gave us a day</i>

01:30:45.405 --> 01:30:50.010
<i>to show up in D.C.
at the FEMA Headquarters.</i>

01:30:50.043 --> 01:30:52.379
<i>We walked
into Conference Room A,</i>

01:30:52.413 --> 01:30:55.283
<i>which was this windowless,
subterranean conference room.</i>

01:30:55.315 --> 01:30:57.318
<i>There were televisions
all around the walls</i>

01:30:57.351 --> 01:30:59.754
<i>all playing FOX News.</i>

01:30:59.787 --> 01:31:02.390
<i>One representative from FEMA</i>

01:31:02.422 --> 01:31:04.324
<i>and one representative
from the military</i>

01:31:04.357 --> 01:31:06.627
<i>gave a quick pep talk.</i>

01:31:06.659 --> 01:31:09.396
They kept saying "the stuff,"
and by that they meant PPE.

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:11.499
<i>And they kept saying, "There's
stuff all around the world.</i>

01:31:11.531 --> 01:31:12.699
<i>"There's stuff in the U.S.,
and we need</i>

01:31:12.732 --> 01:31:15.636
<i>to get it to hospitals
as fast as possible."</i>

01:31:15.668 --> 01:31:18.372
Everyone stood up and started
filing into different offices,

01:31:18.404 --> 01:31:20.807
and I remember the only people
left were the volunteers.

01:31:20.841 --> 01:31:23.343
<i>We thought we would be
auxiliary support</i>

01:31:23.377 --> 01:31:25.513
<i>for an existing procurement
team that just needed</i>

01:31:25.546 --> 01:31:27.815
<i>to be expanded
as quickly as possible</i>

01:31:27.847 --> 01:31:29.984
<i>and we would, you know,
do data entry for contracts.</i>

01:31:30.016 --> 01:31:32.586
<i>And instead, we were the team.</i>

01:31:32.619 --> 01:31:35.456
I think when people imagined
the federal government response

01:31:35.489 --> 01:31:38.426
in the war room, they thought
it would be this big,

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:41.561
<i>you know, energized
group of experts,</i>

01:31:41.595 --> 01:31:45.533
not ten 20-year-old volunteers
all just with private laptops.

01:31:45.565 --> 01:31:47.033
<i>No industry relationships,</i>

01:31:47.066 --> 01:31:50.337
<i>no experience working
in supply chain.</i>

01:31:50.370 --> 01:31:53.341
<i>So we started cold-emailing
people we knew</i>

01:31:53.373 --> 01:31:54.941
<i>who had business relationships
in China,</i>

01:31:54.975 --> 01:31:56.877
<i>looking for factories online,</i>

01:31:56.909 --> 01:32:00.947
<i>and emailing them from
our personal Gmail accounts.</i>

01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:03.016
Because we had never
done this before,

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:04.918
you know, there were all these
really basic questions

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:07.754
about how a federal procurement
operation should work.

01:32:07.788 --> 01:32:09.457
We would call factories
and say,

01:32:09.489 --> 01:32:11.624
"We think the federal
government can send you a check

01:32:11.658 --> 01:32:13.593
in 60 days,"
and they would say,

01:32:13.627 --> 01:32:16.097
"There's someone
with a briefcase of cash,

01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:18.732
and they are offering
to pay me right now."

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.935
<i>And we would run
around the FEMA building</i>

01:32:20.967 --> 01:32:23.671
<i>looking for someone who could
tell us what payment terms</i>

01:32:23.704 --> 01:32:25.840
<i>the federal government
was allowed to offer,</i>

01:32:25.873 --> 01:32:29.143
and no one ever told us.

01:32:29.176 --> 01:32:32.546
<i>One week into our work,
several government employees</i>

01:32:32.579 --> 01:32:34.849
<i>walked into the room
and handed out NDAs</i>

01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.550
<i>and told us we had
to sign the NDAs</i>

01:32:36.583 --> 01:32:38.486
<i>or leave the room immediately,</i>

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:40.687
<i>and we all had built
our own relationships</i>

01:32:40.721 --> 01:32:44.725
<i>with manufacturers, and it
felt like if we walked away,</i>

01:32:44.757 --> 01:32:46.559
it would negatively affect
our ability

01:32:46.592 --> 01:32:49.596
to buy this critical,
lifesaving equipment.

01:32:49.629 --> 01:32:54.534
<i>And so we all begrudgingly
signed the NDA.</i>

01:32:54.568 --> 01:32:56.070
<i>In the room,
there were those TVs</i>

01:32:56.102 --> 01:32:57.837
<i>all around the walls
playing the news.</i>

01:32:57.870 --> 01:32:59.774
<i>They always had
a death counter.</i>

01:32:59.806 --> 01:33:01.742
<i>And so every hour
we were sitting there,</i>

01:33:01.775 --> 01:33:04.779
<i>trying to buy PPE that
we all knew could save lives,</i>

01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:06.780
and we were watching the
number of deaths in the U.S.

01:33:06.814 --> 01:33:09.083
<i>tick higher
and higher and higher.</i>

01:33:09.115 --> 01:33:11.819
<i>And that weighed on all of us.</i>

01:33:11.851 --> 01:33:13.586
<i>The president also
instructed me to make sure</i>

01:33:13.619 --> 01:33:15.722
<i>that I break down
every barrier needed</i>

01:33:15.756 --> 01:33:18.691
to make sure that
the teams can succeed.

01:33:18.725 --> 01:33:20.761
<i>The first time Jared Kushner
came into the room,</i>

01:33:20.793 --> 01:33:23.196
<i>he had this big entourage,
and he said,</i>

01:33:23.230 --> 01:33:25.199
<i>"I want to make this
as effective as possible.</i>

01:33:25.231 --> 01:33:27.435
<i>"Tell me the problems
that you have,</i>

01:33:27.467 --> 01:33:29.202
<i>and I will solve them today."</i>

01:33:29.235 --> 01:33:31.571
And we said, "We need
to be able to pay upfront."

01:33:31.605 --> 01:33:34.442
And he said, "Done,"

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:37.044
<i>but there was no action taken
that we saw whatsoever.</i>

01:33:37.077 --> 01:33:39.747
<i>In the entire time
that I was a volunteer,</i>

01:33:39.779 --> 01:33:43.983
our team did not directly
purchase a single mask.

01:33:44.016 --> 01:33:46.519
<i>Kushner failed
to protect doctors and nurses,</i>

01:33:46.552 --> 01:33:48.122
<i>but he was willing
to trade government help</i>

01:33:48.154 --> 01:33:50.824
<i>for political benefits.</i>

01:33:50.857 --> 01:33:54.028
<i>When the Democratic Governor
of California, Gavin Newsom,</i>

01:33:54.061 --> 01:33:56.564
<i>desperately needed
testing swabs,</i>

01:33:56.596 --> 01:33:58.598
<i>Kushner said Trump
would grant the request</i>

01:33:58.632 --> 01:34:00.568
<i>on two conditions:</i>

01:34:00.601 --> 01:34:01.769
<i>Newsom would have
to get on the phone</i>

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.938
<i>and ask Trump personally</i>

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:07.775
<i>and then thank him publicly.</i>

01:34:07.807 --> 01:34:09.243
I want to thank
the president,

01:34:09.275 --> 01:34:13.213
not only for being available
for a phone call

01:34:13.247 --> 01:34:15.883
at a moment's notice,
but being willing

01:34:15.915 --> 01:34:19.587
to directly commit to all of us
in the state of California.

01:34:19.619 --> 01:34:21.689
<i>Built
around personal relationships,</i>

01:34:21.721 --> 01:34:24.257
<i>Kushner's task force was run
by his college roommate</i>

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:26.760
<i>and Ivanka Trump's
former assistant.</i>

01:34:26.793 --> 01:34:29.597
<i>Rather than rely on
experienced public officials,</i>

01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:32.867
<i>the task force prioritized
private tips in a spreadsheet</i>

01:34:32.900 --> 01:34:34.602
<i>called "VIP Update,"</i>

01:34:34.635 --> 01:34:36.570
<i>which included
two Republican dentists</i>

01:34:36.602 --> 01:34:39.172
<i>and a FOX News personality.</i>

01:34:39.205 --> 01:34:41.574
<i>The whole philosophy
of the task force</i>

01:34:41.607 --> 01:34:43.977
was that the government
can't get things done

01:34:44.011 --> 01:34:45.546
<i>and they thought
the private market</i>

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.848
<i>could largely settle
this issue,</i>

01:34:47.881 --> 01:34:50.117
<i>but it was only once
they had tried and failed</i>

01:34:50.150 --> 01:34:52.086
that they'd started to blame
other people and say,

01:34:52.119 --> 01:34:54.788
"Actually, this was your job
the whole time."

01:34:54.820 --> 01:34:56.957
You have instances where
in cities, they're running out,

01:34:56.989 --> 01:34:58.525
but the state
still has a stockpile.

01:34:58.559 --> 01:35:00.226
And the notion
of the federal stockpile

01:35:00.260 --> 01:35:01.794
was it's supposed
to be our stockpile.

01:35:01.828 --> 01:35:03.631
It's not supposed
to be states' stockpiles

01:35:03.663 --> 01:35:05.298
that they then use.

01:35:05.332 --> 01:35:08.669
My understanding
is the only reason

01:35:08.702 --> 01:35:12.272
the federal stockpile exists
is to distribute it to states.

01:35:12.306 --> 01:35:15.075
<i>The people in charge
on the task force said,</i>

01:35:15.107 --> 01:35:16.776
<i>you know,
talking about the president...</i>

01:35:16.810 --> 01:35:18.646
love him or hate him,
he's a marketing genius.

01:35:18.678 --> 01:35:20.647
He came up with the strategy
to blame the states,

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:22.049
because the federal government

01:35:22.082 --> 01:35:23.684
hasn't been able
to do this effectively.

01:35:25.351 --> 01:35:30.123
<i>Federal government
has assets and abilities</i>

01:35:30.156 --> 01:35:32.760
<i>that no state
can possibly mobilize.</i>

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:35.329
<i>They have a global
supply chain.</i>

01:35:35.361 --> 01:35:36.997
They have a logistic capability

01:35:37.029 --> 01:35:38.731
<i>through
the Department of Defense</i>

01:35:38.765 --> 01:35:40.601
<i>and Department
of Homeland Security</i>

01:35:40.633 --> 01:35:43.570
to get stuff in
and distribute it

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:45.905
to places all over the country.

01:35:45.939 --> 01:35:49.276
<i>President Trump flipped that
on its head.</i>

01:35:49.309 --> 01:35:54.181
Then there became this mad
rush for each and every state

01:35:54.213 --> 01:35:58.217
to try and find equipment
on their own.

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:04.992
<i>Breaker one nine,
this here's Rubber Duck.</i>

01:36:05.025 --> 01:36:06.927
<i>Mercy sakes alive,</i>

01:36:06.959 --> 01:36:10.064
<i>looks like we've
got us a convoy.</i>

01:36:10.096 --> 01:36:14.701
<i>We continued to source and
ship as much PPE as we can</i>

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:17.304
<i>by whatever means necessary.</i>

01:36:17.337 --> 01:36:19.607
<i>♪ Arizona, noon,
on the seventh of June ♪</i>

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.709
<i>♪ When they highballed
over the pass ♪</i>

01:36:21.742 --> 01:36:26.245
We had the governor of
Massachusetts using a plane

01:36:26.279 --> 01:36:30.217
<i>from the New England Patriots
to bring equipment from China.</i>

01:36:30.249 --> 01:36:32.285
<i>♪ 'Cause we got

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:35.189
<i>The equipment is now in the

01:36:35.221 --> 01:36:38.758
<i>who will deliver it

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:40.394
<i>♪ Convoy ♪</i>

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:43.030
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

01:36:43.062 --> 01:36:45.132
We had the governor
of Maryland

01:36:45.164 --> 01:36:47.700
using contacts of his wife's

01:36:47.734 --> 01:36:52.839
<i>to bring equipment in
from South Korea.</i>

01:36:52.873 --> 01:36:55.709
<i>He felt it important enough
to guard that equipment</i>

01:36:55.742 --> 01:36:58.345
<i>when it landed in Maryland,
because he didn't want it</i>

01:36:58.378 --> 01:37:01.949
<i>confiscated by
the federal government.</i>

01:37:01.981 --> 01:37:03.751
<i>We're competing against
every other state,</i>

01:37:03.784 --> 01:37:05.219
<i>every other country.</i>

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:08.656
Now we're even competing
against the federal government.

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:13.327
It's like being on eBay
with 50 other states,

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:16.296
bidding on a ventilator.

01:37:16.329 --> 01:37:19.733
<i>You see the bid go up
'cause California bid.</i>

01:37:19.766 --> 01:37:23.937
<i>Illinois bid, Florida bid,
New York bids,</i>

01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:26.073
<i>California rebids.</i>

01:37:26.105 --> 01:37:29.376
<i>And then FEMA starts bidding.</i>

01:37:29.409 --> 01:37:33.313
So FEMA is driving up
the price.

01:37:33.346 --> 01:37:35.049
What?

01:37:35.815 --> 01:37:39.052
I stand here as someone
who has had confirmed orders

01:37:39.086 --> 01:37:44.091
for millions of pieces of gear
evaporate in front of us,

01:37:44.123 --> 01:37:47.160
and I can't tell you
how frustrating it is.

01:37:47.194 --> 01:37:49.096
<i>I get a feeling if there's
somebody had the chance to</i>

01:37:49.128 --> 01:37:50.797
<i>sell to you or had the chance
to sell to me,</i>

01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:53.300
<i>I'm gonna lose
every one of those.</i>

01:37:53.333 --> 01:37:55.035
All right, Charlie.
Thank you very much.

01:37:55.068 --> 01:37:57.204
Well, we do like you going out
seeing what you can get,

01:37:57.236 --> 01:37:59.205
if you can get it faster,

01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:02.843
and the price is always
a component to that also,

01:38:02.876 --> 01:38:05.779
and maybe that's why
you lost to the feds.

01:38:05.811 --> 01:38:08.247
I'll tell you,
that's probably why, but...

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.484
<i>If the goal was
to get PPE to the states,</i>

01:38:10.516 --> 01:38:12.418
<i>why would
the federal government</i>

01:38:12.452 --> 01:38:15.222
<i>be driving up the price
to outbid them?</i>

01:38:15.254 --> 01:38:19.092
<i>Or was driving up the price
the whole point?</i>

01:38:19.126 --> 01:38:20.894
<i>This morning,
our first project</i>

01:38:20.927 --> 01:38:21.929
<i>that we called Airbridge...</i>

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.198
that's Airbridge,
that's the name.

01:38:24.230 --> 01:38:26.300
<i>And it was a flight
that landed in JFK</i>

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:29.036
<i>and contained
nearly 2 million masks.</i>

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:31.038
This is the first
of 50 flights,

01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:33.973
and that will probably
increase substantially.

01:38:34.007 --> 01:38:36.376
<i>Project Airbridge
was a plan to subsidize</i>

01:38:36.409 --> 01:38:40.848
<i>the efforts of private
companies to buy and sell PPE.</i>

01:38:40.881 --> 01:38:43.117
<i>Max Kennedy's team
would find the PPE</i>

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:45.486
<i>and negotiate
the lowest possible price.</i>

01:38:45.519 --> 01:38:48.055
<i>Private companies
would then pay the bill.</i>

01:38:48.087 --> 01:38:49.856
<i>Then the federal government
would pay</i>

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:53.761
<i>to fly the PPE stateside
from overseas.</i>

01:38:53.793 --> 01:38:54.961
<i>And we had partnered</i>

01:38:54.994 --> 01:38:58.498
<i>with the five largest
medical distributors.</i>

01:38:58.531 --> 01:39:00.400
Once we shipped it
to the United States,

01:39:00.432 --> 01:39:02.903
<i>they would take over
and sell directly</i>

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:05.939
to whoever they would like,
at whatever price they wanted.

01:39:05.971 --> 01:39:08.941
Just to clarify,
that explains why states say

01:39:08.975 --> 01:39:11.111
they're bidding like
they're on eBay,

01:39:11.144 --> 01:39:13.780
because the supplies are
going to the private sector,

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.949
and then they have to go there
to get the supplies.

01:39:15.981 --> 01:39:17.818
That's normally
how things work, right?

01:39:17.851 --> 01:39:20.320
So I'm not here to disrupt,

01:39:20.352 --> 01:39:24.557
uh, a supply chain.

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.493
<i>The U.S. government
was handing a huge amount</i>

01:39:26.525 --> 01:39:28.261
<i>of business to these
five companies</i>

01:39:28.294 --> 01:39:30.096
<i>that were chosen
fairly arbitrarily.</i>

01:39:32.332 --> 01:39:34.901
There were increasing concerns,
I think, from competitors,

01:39:34.935 --> 01:39:36.236
that these five companies
were getting

01:39:36.269 --> 01:39:38.571
a hugely unfair advantage,

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:42.075
and so I was asked on several
different occasions explicitly

01:39:42.107 --> 01:39:46.312
to find a justification to have
selected these companies way...

01:39:46.346 --> 01:39:49.216
you know, months after
they had been selected.

01:39:49.248 --> 01:39:51.284
<i>At least one of
these companies, Cardinal,</i>

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:56.522
<i>saw its PPE orders surge
to 12 times the normal volume.</i>

01:39:56.556 --> 01:39:58.458
<i>Profit-making was also part of</i>

01:39:58.490 --> 01:40:00.993
<i>the pandemic pricing plan
at Gilead,</i>

01:40:01.026 --> 01:40:03.462
<i>which manufactured
the one drug, Remdesivir,</i>

01:40:03.495 --> 01:40:06.400
<i>that was effective
at treating COVID.</i>

01:40:06.432 --> 01:40:08.935
<i>The federal government owned
patents on the drug,</i>

01:40:08.968 --> 01:40:11.171
<i>and it paid
for essential research.</i>

01:40:11.204 --> 01:40:13.540
<i>But the Trump administration
permitted Gilead</i>

01:40:13.573 --> 01:40:16.443
<i>to charge more than
$3,000 a patient</i>

01:40:16.476 --> 01:40:20.114
<i>for a treatment that cost
less than $10 to manufacture.</i>

01:40:21.948 --> 01:40:25.252
I left in mid-April,
and my takeaway

01:40:25.284 --> 01:40:27.220
was really that
I still feel like

01:40:27.253 --> 01:40:28.622
I haven't worked
for the government.

01:40:28.654 --> 01:40:31.591
We were so far outside of it.
I mean, we were...

01:40:31.624 --> 01:40:33.961
every single person
we reported to

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:36.463
up the chain of command
was a political appointee.

01:40:36.495 --> 01:40:39.565
<i>The number of FEMA employees
I met, you know,</i>

01:40:39.598 --> 01:40:40.633
<i>I could count on one hand,</i>

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.336
<i>and they were fleeting
interactions.</i>

01:40:42.369 --> 01:40:45.539
It taught me about how
this administration works,

01:40:45.571 --> 01:40:48.040
and I think it largely works,
or it seemed to work,

01:40:48.074 --> 01:40:49.643
in this case,
outside of the government.

01:40:52.145 --> 01:40:54.580
<i>In the course
of three years,</i>

01:40:54.614 --> 01:40:57.384
<i>there was
a systematic dismantling</i>

01:40:57.417 --> 01:41:01.088
<i>of what expertise
had been built</i>

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.089
<i>and what framework
had been built</i>

01:41:03.123 --> 01:41:06.627
<i>to respond to the very
kind of global pandemic</i>

01:41:06.659 --> 01:41:09.395
<i>that we're dealing with.</i>

01:41:09.428 --> 01:41:12.632
It's preventing the people
who were there

01:41:12.665 --> 01:41:17.337
from doing the jobs
that they'd been hired to do.

01:41:17.369 --> 01:41:20.073
<i>Tell me a little bit
about how chloroquine</i>

01:41:20.105 --> 01:41:24.110
<i>and hydroxychloroquine first
came into your point of view.</i>

01:41:24.144 --> 01:41:25.412
You know...

01:41:25.445 --> 01:41:27.648
<i>How did this come up?</i>

01:41:27.681 --> 01:41:29.616
I wish I'd never
heard of chloroquine

01:41:29.649 --> 01:41:33.553
or hydroxychloroquine,
honestly.

01:41:33.586 --> 01:41:37.024
<i>Elon Musk started
the ball rolling with a tweet.</i>

01:41:37.056 --> 01:41:38.992
<i>Momentum for the drugs
picked up steam</i>

01:41:39.025 --> 01:41:40.661
<i>over the next few days
on FOX News,</i>

01:41:40.694 --> 01:41:44.364
<i>where their names
were dropped 176 times.</i>

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:47.234
Early evidence suggests that
chloroquine...

01:41:47.266 --> 01:41:49.502
- Chloroquine.
- Hydroxychloroquine.

01:41:49.535 --> 01:41:51.437
<i>Those look very promising.</i>

01:41:51.471 --> 01:41:55.042
<i>Then Trump started reading
from the FOX script.</i>

01:41:55.074 --> 01:41:56.642
It is known
as a malaria drug,

01:41:56.676 --> 01:41:59.178
and it's been around
for a long time.

01:41:59.212 --> 01:42:02.049
And it's shown
very encouraging...

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:04.551
very, very encouraging...
early results.

01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.622
<i>I believe it was March 23rd.</i>

01:42:08.654 --> 01:42:14.060
<i>I got a call from Secretary
Azar's chief counsel.</i>

01:42:14.093 --> 01:42:18.030
The White House wanted us
to move quickly

01:42:18.064 --> 01:42:20.066
on making this drug available.

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.136
At my direction, the federal
government is working to help

01:42:23.168 --> 01:42:27.273
obtain large quantities
of chloroquine.

01:42:27.306 --> 01:42:29.675
I called my scientific team
in BARDA,

01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:32.111
and they said, "No way."

01:42:33.279 --> 01:42:36.550
<i>There was no data to support
that they had any benefit</i>

01:42:36.583 --> 01:42:39.086
<i>against the coronavirus.</i>

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:43.023
They pushed back,
but Dr. Kadlec reiterated

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:46.694
that directive to us and said,
"Get on it, get it done."

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:51.999
<i>We came up with option of an
emergency use authorization.</i>

01:42:52.031 --> 01:42:54.767
<i>We could put boundaries in it,</i>

01:42:54.801 --> 01:42:57.104
<i>restrict the drug
to only be used</i>

01:42:57.137 --> 01:43:00.440
<i>in people who are
hospitalized.</i>

01:43:00.472 --> 01:43:02.341
<i>And I was proud of our team</i>

01:43:02.374 --> 01:43:04.543
for coming up
with that compromise

01:43:04.577 --> 01:43:08.347
that we thought would
protect the Americans.

01:43:08.381 --> 01:43:10.484
<i>Have you ever heard of
a Dr. Zelenko?</i>

01:43:10.516 --> 01:43:12.151
Yes.

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:17.356
<i>He is a very mysterious
presence that seemed to be</i>

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:21.128
<i>involved in the context
of this chloroquine story.</i>

01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.029
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Hi.

01:43:24.763 --> 01:43:28.068
<i>Dr. Vladimir Zelenko
became a right-wing folk hero</i>

01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:30.670
<i>and the Trump team promoted
him as an essential expert</i>

01:43:30.703 --> 01:43:32.571
<i>on the use of
hydroxychloroquine</i>

01:43:32.605 --> 01:43:36.276
<i>as a magical remedy for COVID.</i>

01:43:36.309 --> 01:43:38.712
<i>For the last
almost 16 years,</i>

01:43:38.744 --> 01:43:41.047
I've been a primary care doctor
for a community

01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:43.516
of around 35,000 people.

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:46.686
<i>It's a village
in the town of Monroe.</i>

01:43:46.718 --> 01:43:49.722
It's similar
to an urban environment

01:43:49.756 --> 01:43:53.459
<i>in terms of how close
people live with each other.</i>

01:43:53.493 --> 01:43:55.361
<i>So it's not surprising that</i>

01:43:55.395 --> 01:43:58.065
<i>the virus came
and started spreading.</i>

01:43:58.097 --> 01:44:02.068
And I realized that, my God,
I have an inferno.

01:44:02.101 --> 01:44:04.770
<i>I have a real outbreak.</i>

01:44:04.803 --> 01:44:07.074
<i>I know all these people,
they're like family to me.</i>

01:44:07.106 --> 01:44:10.176
So it was personal.

01:44:10.209 --> 01:44:11.811
<i>The whole world
was focusing on</i>

01:44:11.845 --> 01:44:14.080
<i>building more respirators,
more hospitals,</i>

01:44:14.114 --> 01:44:15.315
<i>and there was nothing
being offered</i>

01:44:15.347 --> 01:44:17.216
<i>to primary care doctors.</i>

01:44:17.249 --> 01:44:18.517
You know,
we're front-line soldiers

01:44:18.551 --> 01:44:20.687
with no bullets, no weapons.

01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.089
<i>So then you have to improvise.</i>

01:44:24.757 --> 01:44:26.426
<i>Dr. Zelenko improvised</i>

01:44:26.458 --> 01:44:28.360
<i>what he thought
was a magic bullet</i>

01:44:28.394 --> 01:44:30.564
<i>that contained his own
unproven mash-up</i>

01:44:30.596 --> 01:44:33.833
<i>of zinc, azithromycin,
and hydroxychloroquine.</i>

01:44:35.901 --> 01:44:38.204
<i>But there was no
reputable clinical trial</i>

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:40.207
<i>that confirmed
Zelenko's claims</i>

01:44:40.239 --> 01:44:44.376
<i>that early use of his cocktail
could cure COVID.</i>

01:44:44.409 --> 01:44:48.114
I wasn't doing research.
I was just treating patients.

01:44:48.147 --> 01:44:49.348
But I'm not stupid.

01:44:49.382 --> 01:44:51.485
I saw exactly
what was happening.

01:44:51.517 --> 01:44:53.252
Patients stopped dying.

01:44:54.587 --> 01:44:56.388
<i>I just found potentially</i>

01:44:56.422 --> 01:44:58.391
<i>one of the most important
pieces of information</i>

01:44:58.423 --> 01:45:00.627
<i>in the history of information.</i>

01:45:00.659 --> 01:45:03.162
<i>I'm not a politician.
I don't have any connections.</i>

01:45:03.195 --> 01:45:07.367
So how else does a person
who's unconnected

01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.669
reach the highest levels
of government?

01:45:09.702 --> 01:45:11.570
It's called social media.

01:45:11.604 --> 01:45:16.176
Um, hello, President Trump.

01:45:16.208 --> 01:45:19.912
My name is
Dr. Vladimir Zelenko.

01:45:19.945 --> 01:45:21.614
<i>So I made a YouTube video</i>

01:45:21.647 --> 01:45:23.550
<i>addressed to the president
of the United States,</i>

01:45:23.583 --> 01:45:26.486
and the next day, his chief of
staff, Mark Meadows, calls me.

01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:31.190
<i>We had a conversation,
and that started a process</i>

01:45:31.223 --> 01:45:32.691
<i>that eventually led me to</i>

01:45:32.725 --> 01:45:35.829
<i>the FDA commissioner,
Stephen Hahn.</i>

01:45:35.861 --> 01:45:37.564
It's not every day you get

01:45:37.596 --> 01:45:38.931
the commissioner of the FDA
calling you on your cell phone.

01:45:38.964 --> 01:45:40.534
<i>According to the FDA...</i>

01:45:44.904 --> 01:45:46.806
There was not
a scientific reason

01:45:46.838 --> 01:45:48.841
to push either one
of those drugs.

01:45:48.874 --> 01:45:52.244
<i>The reason they were pushing
them so hard was because</i>

01:45:52.278 --> 01:45:55.882
<i>the president was claiming
that they were a miracle drug.</i>

01:45:55.914 --> 01:45:58.784
Someone had given him
this advice.

01:45:58.818 --> 01:46:03.556
I happen to be taking it.
I happen to be taking it.

01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:06.392
I'm taking it.
Hydroxychloroquine.

01:46:06.426 --> 01:46:08.294
Right now, yeah.

01:46:08.328 --> 01:46:09.663
Did you hear
what he said afterwards?

01:46:09.695 --> 01:46:12.498
"Yeah, I received a letter..."

01:46:12.531 --> 01:46:14.568
From a doctor the other day,

01:46:14.601 --> 01:46:17.204
from Westchester, New York,
around the area.

01:46:17.236 --> 01:46:18.904
He didn't want anything.
He just said,

01:46:18.937 --> 01:46:21.274
"Sir, I have
hundreds of patients,

01:46:21.306 --> 01:46:24.644
and I give them
hydroxychloroquine."

01:46:24.677 --> 01:46:26.413
So that was a letter

01:46:26.445 --> 01:46:27.846
I sent to the president.

01:46:27.879 --> 01:46:30.482
But I thought it was
a very well-crafted letter

01:46:30.516 --> 01:46:33.320
by a man
who's a respected doctor.

01:46:33.352 --> 01:46:34.687
He said it was
a well-crafted letter.

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:35.821
I was proud of that.

01:46:46.565 --> 01:46:48.867
It was really frustrating,

01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:51.637
because here we are
on the front lines,

01:46:51.671 --> 01:46:53.807
<i>we're trying to do
everything we can,</i>

01:46:53.839 --> 01:46:55.874
and if, you know, there's
a chance that this could work,

01:46:55.908 --> 01:46:57.677
<i>let's go ahead and try it.</i>

01:46:57.709 --> 01:46:59.445
<i>But then, consistently,</i>

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:01.548
<i>the trials that had been
high quality looking at this</i>

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.949
<i>have shown that
there's no benefit to it.</i>

01:47:03.982 --> 01:47:05.952
And we have moved on
to other therapies.

01:47:05.985 --> 01:47:08.955
But unfortunately, you know,
it can come back and be revived

01:47:08.988 --> 01:47:12.659
<i>by a tweet from a leader
who still believes in it.</i>

01:47:12.691 --> 01:47:14.461
The next day, if you admit

01:47:14.494 --> 01:47:17.264
a patient with COVID-19,
some of them are gonna ask,

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:18.865
<i>"Are you gonna give me
the Trump drug?"</i>

01:47:18.897 --> 01:47:21.635
<i>And if you go through a long
explanation of, you know,</i>

01:47:21.668 --> 01:47:23.670
<i>"Actually,
there's no benefit,"</i>

01:47:23.703 --> 01:47:26.306
it's really hard
to explain this.

01:47:26.338 --> 01:47:28.774
And it would be
so much more helpful

01:47:28.807 --> 01:47:32.611
if the leader of the country,
who sets the example, said,

01:47:32.645 --> 01:47:34.446
<i>"We should follow
the science on this."</i>

01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:36.383
I've seen things
that I sort of like,

01:47:36.415 --> 01:47:38.885
so what do I know?
I'm not a doctor.

01:47:38.918 --> 01:47:41.521
It was about six days
after that EUA.

01:47:41.553 --> 01:47:45.057
<i>I woke up to an email string</i>

01:47:45.091 --> 01:47:50.062
<i>that had our Assistant
Secretary for Health,</i>

01:47:50.096 --> 01:47:55.302
<i>our Director of FEMA,
our ASPR, Dr. Kadlec,</i>

01:47:55.334 --> 01:48:00.573
<i>and the FDA all saying
we need to flood the streets</i>

01:48:00.605 --> 01:48:02.675
<i>of New York and New Jersey</i>

01:48:02.708 --> 01:48:06.078
<i>with that drug
as quickly as possible.</i>

01:48:06.111 --> 01:48:10.582
And in that email discussion,
someone was brave enough...

01:48:10.615 --> 01:48:11.783
<i>they said, "But wait a minute.</i>

01:48:11.816 --> 01:48:16.021
<i>The EUA says 'for hospitalized
patients only.'"</i>

01:48:16.055 --> 01:48:19.459
<i>They said, "No, it needs
to go into the pharmacies.</i>

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.328
<i>"It needs to
go out everywhere.</i>

01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:23.696
<i>"The EUA doesn't matter.</i>

01:48:23.730 --> 01:48:25.632
Push the drug out now."

01:48:27.467 --> 01:48:29.502
<i>The same FDA that
dragged its feet for weeks</i>

01:48:29.534 --> 01:48:31.604
<i>at approving vital COVID tests</i>

01:48:31.637 --> 01:48:34.541
<i>suddenly worked at lightning
speed to greenlight use</i>

01:48:34.574 --> 01:48:36.810
<i>of a drug with no proven
effect on the disease,</i>

01:48:36.842 --> 01:48:39.645
<i>just because the White House
wanted it done.</i>

01:48:39.678 --> 01:48:41.580
<i>If this drug works,</i>

01:48:41.614 --> 01:48:45.051
it will be wonderful,
it'll be so beautiful.

01:48:45.083 --> 01:48:47.419
It'll be a gift from heaven.

01:48:47.453 --> 01:48:49.455
I lost it.

01:48:49.489 --> 01:48:52.859
I lost all respect
for that chain of command,

01:48:52.891 --> 01:48:55.961
for that security

01:48:55.994 --> 01:49:00.434
that we as Americans
have put in those people.

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:07.673
And that is the moment that
I decided to break protocol

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:12.111
and alert Americans
in a different way.

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.080
<i>In the doctrine
of politics,</i>

01:49:14.113 --> 01:49:16.615
<i>Rick Bright committed
a mortal sin.</i>

01:49:16.649 --> 01:49:18.952
<i>He went to the press.</i>

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:22.489
<i>It was two weeks exactly
after that</i>

01:49:22.521 --> 01:49:26.959
<i>that I learned that I had been
removed from my position.</i>

01:49:29.662 --> 01:49:32.865
It's not easy to come forward
in this administration, okay?

01:49:32.899 --> 01:49:37.771
I'm not trying to be soft
in here, but it is not easy.

01:49:38.937 --> 01:49:43.909
It was a very hard process

01:49:43.943 --> 01:49:48.949
to lay our careers on the line
to push back.

01:49:50.449 --> 01:49:52.117
<i>Time is running out because</i>

01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:55.020
the virus is still
spreading everywhere.

01:49:55.053 --> 01:49:58.958
The window is closing
to address this pandemic.

01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:01.895
<i>So, you know, Dr. Bright
is up there testifying today.</i>

01:50:01.927 --> 01:50:06.765
And on hydroxychloroquine,
Dr. Bright literally signed

01:50:06.798 --> 01:50:10.069
in the application
for FDA authorization of it.

01:50:10.101 --> 01:50:13.172
We will either be remembered
for what we did

01:50:13.205 --> 01:50:16.208
or for what we failed to do
to address this crisis.

01:50:16.242 --> 01:50:18.645
<i>I watched this guy for
a little while this morning,</i>

01:50:18.677 --> 01:50:21.747
and he looks like an angry,
disgruntled employee

01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:23.582
who, frankly,
according to some people,

01:50:23.615 --> 01:50:25.217
didn't do a very good job.

01:50:25.251 --> 01:50:28.154
Would you describe
the government's response

01:50:28.186 --> 01:50:31.524
as a success or a failure?

01:50:31.556 --> 01:50:33.659
I believe we could have
done better.

01:50:35.727 --> 01:50:37.864
<i>Watching the
administration's response</i>

01:50:37.896 --> 01:50:41.600
<i>to Bright was frightening.</i>

01:50:41.633 --> 01:50:43.669
We all wanted to help,
but we didn't wanna be

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:46.673
on the front page
of a newspaper.

01:50:46.705 --> 01:50:49.074
<i>I spoke to a couple
of attorneys</i>

01:50:49.107 --> 01:50:51.010
<i>who said it's so unusual
for the government</i>

01:50:51.043 --> 01:50:55.214
to require an NDA at all,
let alone for volunteers

01:50:55.248 --> 01:50:57.217
who don't have any access
to government systems.

01:50:57.249 --> 01:50:59.752
We had no access to any
confidential information.

01:50:59.784 --> 01:51:01.820
The only thing we were
basically being prevented

01:51:01.854 --> 01:51:04.923
from talking about was the fact
that the response was...

01:51:04.957 --> 01:51:06.793
seemed to be largely bungled.

01:51:06.825 --> 01:51:09.561
To date, we've facilitated
the supply

01:51:09.595 --> 01:51:13.132
of more than 38 million
N95 masks nationwide.

01:51:13.164 --> 01:51:15.033
<i>And I would watch the news,
and I'd hear</i>

01:51:15.066 --> 01:51:16.836
<i>the Trump administration
talk about the work</i>

01:51:16.869 --> 01:51:18.972
that was happening,
and what was happening did not

01:51:19.004 --> 01:51:20.640
match what the administration
was speaking about.

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:23.776
<i>So I did send in</i>

01:51:23.809 --> 01:51:25.845
<i>a whistleblower report
to Congress,</i>

01:51:25.878 --> 01:51:28.648
<i>as well as calling
several journalists</i>

01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:31.918
<i>who I basically
just found online.</i>

01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:33.619
<i>It was nerve-racking.</i>

01:51:33.653 --> 01:51:35.288
<i>I was worried about the NDA,</i>

01:51:35.320 --> 01:51:39.191
<i>I was worried about

Americans wear a basic cloth
or fabric mask.

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:35.080
They can be either purchased
online or simply made at home,

01:52:35.114 --> 01:52:37.016
probably material
that you'd have at home.

01:52:37.048 --> 01:52:39.319
Really a voluntary thing.
You can do it.

01:52:39.351 --> 01:52:41.587
You don't have to do it.
I'm choosing not to do it.

01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:44.591
But some people may wanna
do it, and that's okay.

01:52:44.623 --> 01:52:46.224

<i>53,000 deaths from

<i>that it's hard to

01:59:28.761 --> 01:59:31.129

01:59:38.404 --> 01:59:41.173

02:00:19.845 --> 02:00:22.615
<i>The truth is that
political leaders</i>

02:00:22.647 --> 02:00:25.818
<i>failed to follow
public health guidance,</i>

02:00:25.851 --> 02:00:30.256

02:01:26.912 --> 02:01:29.214

of manmade problems,</i>

02:02:00.512 --> 02:02:03.749
<i>we must prepare
to solve together.</i>

02:02:03.781 --> 02:02:06.151
<i>Our ability to reckon
with the future</i>

02:02:06.185 --> 02:02:09.655
<i>will depend on how much
we learn from our recent past.</i>

02:02:09.687 --> 02:02:13.391

finally take off our masks,</i>

02:02:13.425 --> 02:02:16.729
