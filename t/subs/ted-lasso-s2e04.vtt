WEBVTT

00:13.305 --> 00:15.891
A scarf. Cool.

00:16.475 --> 00:19.228
-Bumbercatch, did you make this?
-Yeah, man, knitting soothes me.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.648
Sorry.
I didn't know everyone was doing booze.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.942
Nah, mate. Cheers! This is great.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.362
I can wrap it around my booze.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.697
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Colin.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.374
Dani Rojas, approach.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.042
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:43.001 --> 00:44.878
May your Secret Santa reveal himself.

00:50.843 --> 00:51.969
And more booze!

00:52.052 --> 00:53.804
All right. Let's see here.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.475
Nate, is this a photo of you and me
after our first win?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.227
-Yeah.
-Thanks, buddy. I appreciate it.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.562
Look at that.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.065
"Ted, thank you for everything
you've done for me. Nathan."

01:06.567 --> 01:07.943
What a lovely inscription,

01:08.026 --> 01:10.529
that you wrote completely
over my head, face and body.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.406
Sorry.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.831
Secret Santa's a fun new tradition.
As is a half-day for Christmas.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.749
Well, I think we gotta be responsible.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.710
We gotta save our legs
for tomorrow's big game.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.295
So, to responsibility.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.797
-Being responsible.
-Responsibility.

01:28.881 --> 01:32.217
And if we get this Boxing Day win,
we'll finally have more wins than losses.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.847
Coach, what are you doing
the rest of the day?

01:36.930 --> 01:38.515
I'm just spending it with my family.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.268
I finally make enough money
to buy something nice for my dad.

01:41.351 --> 01:43.520
He can be very tricky to shop for.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.856
He's one of them fellas
that buys everything for himself, huh?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.317
I wish. No, he just hates everything.

01:49.568 --> 01:50.569
What about you, Coach?

01:51.195 --> 01:54.865
Jane and I are going to a pagan
Christmas ritual at Stonehenge.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.825
What? I thought you two broke up.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.703
We did, but we got the tickets
before we broke up.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.997
So, we're going as friends.

02:02.789 --> 02:03.916
That's gonna be…

02:05.083 --> 02:07.586
What about you, Keeley?
What are you guys getting into?

02:07.669 --> 02:10.631
Roy and I are celebrating a new tradition
that I'm calling "Sexy Christmas."

02:11.798 --> 02:14.134
It's not gonna be like that.
It's gonna be a swinging--

02:14.218 --> 02:16.720
A swinging Sinatra,

02:16.803 --> 02:19.556
Vegas-y type Christmas for adults
where we get all dressed up,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.392
and we sip on martinis, sit by the fire.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.728
And then it's gonna be like that.

02:28.315 --> 02:29.691
Awooga!

02:30.526 --> 02:33.779
-You're talking about Sexy Christmas?
-Maybe.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.863
Hey, boss.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.657
-Let me get you a drink, yeah?
-Yes. Thank you.

02:36.740 --> 02:38.200
How you spending
the rest of Santa's birthday?

02:38.283 --> 02:40.285
I'm going to a Christmas party
at a friend's house.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.621
What friend's that?
First and last name, please.

02:42.704 --> 02:43.705
Elton John.

02:44.540 --> 02:46.250
Holy shit!

02:46.333 --> 02:48.877
Hold me closer, Tiny Dancer,
Prancer and Vixen.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.840
Yes. Yes. It's actually rather lovely.

02:52.923 --> 02:55.717
We just sing carols around Elton's piano,

02:55.801 --> 02:59.096
and hopefully Rachel Weisz and Daniel
Craig will do their puppet show again.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.265
That sounds like double-O heaven to me.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.600
What about you, Higgins?

03:03.684 --> 03:06.270
The Higginses will be opening
Christmas presents

03:06.353 --> 03:09.648
and then hosting an open house
for players who don't have family in town.

03:10.732 --> 03:14.778
Something we do every year.
We usually get about two.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.948
It's really nice.
You're more than welcome, Ted.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.618
I appreciate that offer, Higgie Smalls.
But I am all good, baby, baby.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.954
This is the first Christmas
the family's away from each other,

03:24.037 --> 03:27.124
so, you know, once Henry wakes up here,
in about an hour,

03:27.207 --> 03:30.502
he wants us to open presents
and spend all day together on FaceTime.

03:30.586 --> 03:34.089
It's gonna be a lovely afternoon
of yuletide cheer in two dimensions.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.302
-Hey. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

03:38.385 --> 03:40.429
-Merry Christmas, Keeley.
-Merry Christmas.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.055
How you doin'? What can I help you with?

03:42.139 --> 03:44.391
Have you got anythin'
that I can give as a present?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.393
Did you not buy a Secret Santa gift?

03:46.476 --> 03:47.769
I didn't know I had to.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.732
The email said "Secret Santa."
I didn't wanna ruin the surprise, did I?

03:51.815 --> 03:54.651
-Oh, Jamie.
-You know what, hold on here.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.737
Yep, here you go. Higgins, look alive.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.247
-What are you doin'? No, no.
-Here comes a little magic pixie dust.

04:11.001 --> 04:12.753
Whoo! There's your Christmas miracle.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.179
God bless me… everyone.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.640
Wow.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.367
Okay.

05:27.786 --> 05:28.787
Yep.

05:29.413 --> 05:32.165
Merry Sexy Christmas!

05:34.042 --> 05:35.335
Phoebe.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.257
Didn't get my text, did ya?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.719
What did it say?

05:43.802 --> 05:45.262
My sister got called to surgery,

05:45.345 --> 05:47.556
so Phoebe's got to spend
Sexy Christmas with us.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.474
Right. Okay.

05:50.893 --> 05:54.688
Phoebe, I'm sorry you can't spend
Christmas with your mum.

05:54.771 --> 05:57.941
-But we'll have fun together, yeah?
-Please just leave me alone.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.360
Apparently, she's been like this all week.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.029
Won't talk about it.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.908
I am sorry. I know this does make
Christmas significantly less sexy.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.160
Don't worry about it.
We can do Sexy Boxing Day.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.746
Can't. I've got a match all day. Working.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.123
I can't do the day after.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.292
Sexy December 28th.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.253
-28th. Sexiest of all the days.
-Yeah.

06:19.755 --> 06:22.341
Holy fucking shit. You look incredible.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.402
What could it be?

06:42.486 --> 06:44.112
Clearly the surfboard I asked for.

06:44.196 --> 06:48.116
Rip it, rip it, rip it, rip it!

06:50.619 --> 06:51.995
Perfect!

06:52.079 --> 06:53.330
Okay.

06:53.413 --> 06:56.250
Guests arriving in an hour,
time to clean up.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.669
I'll get it!

07:02.506 --> 07:05.175
Merry Christmas, and welcome to our home.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.678
-Hello!
-Hey!

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
Sorry. I know I'm early,
but I was in the neighborhood

07:09.847 --> 07:13.267
-and I really need to use the restroom.
-No, no. Sam, come in. Come in.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.935
Thank you.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.437
Come through. It's a bit of a mess, but…

07:17.521 --> 07:19.773
-Yeah.
-Wow.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.317
Yeah. To hold us off until dinner
we have mince pies,

07:22.401 --> 07:25.404
cheese and crackers, pigs in blankets,
mulled wine. All the favorites.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.991
So, Sam, back home, what does
Christmas make you think of?

07:29.074 --> 07:30.325
Colonization.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.370
Of course.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.416
But I'm more than happy
to celebrate the day with you.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.252
Back home in Lagos,
we have good friends who celebrate,

07:40.335 --> 07:43.255
and they always eat jollof rice
and goat meat, so I made you some.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.966
But I used chicken.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.634
Thank God.

07:48.260 --> 07:51.972
Mr. Obisanya, it was so cool
what you done with that Dubai Air logo.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.140
Fuck those guys.

07:55.642 --> 07:56.977
Yes, fuck 'em.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.320
I'm really sorry,
but where's your restroom?

08:06.403 --> 08:07.946
Right. Of course. Yes. Back through here.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.656
To your left there, Sam.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.620
Okay. All right. Now it's my turn.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.246
Let's see what we got here.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.666
Did you wrap these yourself?
'Cause this is very well done.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.627
Uh-oh. Oh, boy.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.670
Is this what I think it is? Hold on here.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.422
Wait a minute.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.425
Is this a tiny dartboard
or did I become a giant?

08:28.509 --> 08:30.636
It's a mini dartboard. Do you like it?

08:30.719 --> 08:34.264
That's very smart. No, I don't like it.
I love it! Thank you.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.558
All right, your turn. Come on.
Open up the big one.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.101
I wanna see what you think.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.981
A drone? Dad, you got me a drone!

08:43.065 --> 08:45.609
I know. How irresponsible is that of me?

08:45.692 --> 08:48.320
Considering all the issues
with privacy these days.

08:48.403 --> 08:50.864
And you know what? Mrs. Claus charged
that puppy up last night.

08:50.948 --> 08:53.408
-So, you should be good to go.
-Can I try it out now?

08:53.492 --> 08:55.786
Heck yeah! Yeah, it's no fun
just keeping it in the box.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.663
-Great!
-Oh, boy. Okay. Whoa, whoa.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.706
-Be careful. Easy.
-Mom, here.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.084
You lost him.

09:02.167 --> 09:04.461
Yeah, no. That's gonna happen.
Should have got him socks.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.297
Sorry, Ted. He's just so excited.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.049
-No, that's okay. I get it.
-Nice!

09:09.132 --> 09:10.259
How are you?

09:10.342 --> 09:14.137
I'm good. Yeah.
You know, just plugging away over here.

09:14.221 --> 09:17.266
We got a big match tomorrow
so everybody's focused on that, and--

09:17.349 --> 09:19.268
Henry, careful! No, not in the house!

09:19.351 --> 09:20.352
Sorry, Ted.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.898
It's okay. You go.
Go have fun, and send me photos, okay?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.109
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Ted.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.193
Uh-oh.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.612
Henry, careful! The baseboards!
Geez. I--

09:45.544 --> 09:46.545
Shoot.

09:52.426 --> 09:56.513
Phoebe, whatever it is,
we just wanna try and make it better.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.101
What have you got to be sad about?
Did one of the Paw Patrol dogs die?

10:03.979 --> 10:07.524
Listen, Phoebe, problems,
they're like mushrooms, yeah?

10:07.608 --> 10:10.319
The longer you leave them in the dark,
the bigger they get.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.321
A boy at school was mean to me.

10:13.030 --> 10:14.448
What did he do?

10:20.871 --> 10:25.083
"Merry Christmas, Phoebe.
I got you something you desperately need.

10:25.167 --> 10:26.752
Your Secret Santa, Bernard."

10:26.835 --> 10:28.295
Who the fuck is Bernard?

10:29.963 --> 10:33.509
Why did Bernard get you toothpaste
and mouthwash for Christmas, babe?

10:33.592 --> 10:36.762
Because he told everyone
my breath is rancid.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.472
Right, where does Bernard live?

10:38.555 --> 10:41.350
Roy, we are not going
to go beat up a little kid.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.851
Why not?

10:42.935 --> 10:45.562
Why do you think? Fucking knobhead.

10:46.355 --> 10:47.356
Phoebe, listen.

10:47.439 --> 10:50.192
Some kids are just mean
little dickheads, yeah?

10:50.734 --> 10:53.862
I bet your breath doesn't smell that bad.
Come on.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.823
Phoebe, it's me.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.784
Let me have a smell. Come on.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.586
Wow.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.880
Oi! She feels bad enough!

11:11.964 --> 11:14.258
I'm so sorry. I really tried.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.301
It cannot be that bad.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.137
-Go away!
-Phoebe.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.514
I'm a monster.

11:20.597 --> 11:23.559
I've spent the last 20 years
in locker rooms with men.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.436
I promise you, I've smelled worse.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.521
I don't know.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.022
Come on.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.535
I think you might be dying.

11:42.494 --> 11:46.206
Sweetheart, listen. That is not like
"I forgot to brush my teeth" bad.

11:46.290 --> 11:49.001
Or like, "I ate onions" bad.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.087
That's actually medically bad.
Which means it's not your fault.

11:52.671 --> 11:55.340
-Come here.
-Right. I'm gonna sort this.

11:56.133 --> 11:57.551
Put your coats on.

11:57.634 --> 11:58.760
Where are we going?

11:58.844 --> 12:00.596
We're going to
my stupid posh neighborhood,

12:00.679 --> 12:02.347
and we're gonna start knocking on doors.

12:02.431 --> 12:05.726
And if we don't find a dentist
in 10 houses, you each get £1,000.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.354
-Let's go get our coats.
-Yeah!

12:12.149 --> 12:13.817
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

12:13.901 --> 12:15.736
Run, run, run, run, run!

12:18.697 --> 12:20.449
Did Santa get you
something good this morning?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.951
It's okay. I know there's no Santa.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.328
But of course there's a Santa.

12:24.411 --> 12:28.624
There's no way he can deliver presents
to everyone in the world in one night!

12:30.042 --> 12:31.835
But it's not the whole world in one night.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.631
It's the whole world split up
into 24 different time zones.

12:35.714 --> 12:40.260
You see, Santa's true power is not
his speed but his endurance.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.720
Wow.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.889
He got me a bicycle.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.182
Brilliant.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.185
-Hey!
-Merry Christmas!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.937
-Feliz Navidad!
-Merry Christmas.

12:52.439 --> 12:55.984
Look at that! Hello! Thank you for coming.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.946
Of course. My mother was very happy
I wouldn't be alone on Christmas

12:59.029 --> 13:01.698
and insisted I bring
a traditional Mexican ponche!

13:02.491 --> 13:05.369
If you want to be a little bit cheeky,
you can put some tequila in it.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.914
Dani, it already smells
like it has tequila in it.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.290
Yes, this one is pre-cheeked.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.084
Hey! What a turnout! Welcome! Welcome!

13:12.167 --> 13:13.252
-Cool!
-Hello.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.586
A Montlaur family tradition.

13:14.670 --> 13:17.923
We have foie gras, champagne,
and a fancy stinky cheese.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.760
-And this time you try it.
-Okay.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.762
-Hey!
-I brought fried chicken.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.056
Is that a Christmas tradition in Holland?

13:26.640 --> 13:27.891
No.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.061
-Yo!
-Hey!

13:31.144 --> 13:32.813
I just walked into your neighbor's house!

13:32.896 --> 13:34.273
Oh, my God. What's up?

13:34.356 --> 13:36.191
Yes! Let's get drunk.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.690
Help!

14:18.233 --> 14:20.736
Help! Help!

14:30.078 --> 14:31.079
Hey, boss!

14:31.163 --> 14:33.957
How's FaceTime Christmas with Henry going?

14:34.541 --> 14:37.503
Well, I lost him
to an overpriced guilt gift.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.421
Hubris, thy name is Ted.

14:40.672 --> 14:42.424
Grab a coat. You're coming with me.

14:42.508 --> 14:43.509
Yes, ma'am.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.554
And wear the hat. It's a nice touch.

14:47.638 --> 14:48.639
Okay.

14:54.269 --> 14:55.395
Where are we going?

14:55.479 --> 14:58.232
You know what? Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. That's all right.

14:59.483 --> 15:02.528
Actually, hold on. We're not going
to Elton John's holiday party, are we?

15:02.611 --> 15:05.030
'Cause if so, I'm gonna be
severely underdressed.

15:05.113 --> 15:06.823
I could run right back upstairs

15:06.907 --> 15:09.493
and pop on this Donald Duck suit
I bring with me everywhere.

15:10.869 --> 15:13.497
-You look perfect, don't worry.
-All right. I appreciate it.

15:15.666 --> 15:19.670
Last Christmas I gave you my heart

15:19.753 --> 15:24.800
But the very next day you gave it away

15:24.883 --> 15:26.385
This year…

15:26.468 --> 15:28.470
I love the buskers y'all got over here.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.515
Always reminds me of that movie, Once.
You ever see that?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.766
-Great film.
-Yeah.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.977
Yeah, I loved Once so much,
I saw it twice.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.896
I gave you my heart

15:37.980 --> 15:40.107
But the very next day

15:40.190 --> 15:42.818
You gave it away

15:42.901 --> 15:47.197
This year, to save me from tears

15:47.281 --> 15:50.158
I'll give it to someone special

15:50.242 --> 15:51.285
Oh, shit.

15:54.288 --> 15:57.249
I guess that's what I get
for taking a tinkle next to John Holmes.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.501
Come on.

15:59.585 --> 16:01.295
-Merry Christmas. Thank you.
-Merry Christmas, y'all.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.759
You drove yourself?

16:07.843 --> 16:10.053
-That's a Christmas miracle.
-Oi, wanker.

16:10.554 --> 16:11.889
Merry Christmas.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.307
Right back at ya, sir.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.059
Did he just call you a wanker?

16:16.143 --> 16:17.686
Yeah, it's an inside joke.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.521
Mostly inside of him.

16:35.579 --> 16:36.830
Roy Kent!

16:36.914 --> 16:37.915
You gonna sing?

16:37.998 --> 16:41.543
No, we're not carolers.
Is your mum or dad a dentist?

16:41.627 --> 16:43.462
No, they're lawyers.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.589
Figures. Come on.

16:45.672 --> 16:46.924
Thank you.

16:48.342 --> 16:51.011
Uncle Roy, this is embarrassing.

16:53.514 --> 16:54.723
This isn't embarrassing.

16:55.641 --> 16:59.561
Embarrassing is me eating
so much ice cream at a birthday party,

16:59.645 --> 17:03.148
knowing I'm no good with dairy,
that I poop my pants on the bus.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.444
-Finish your story.
-Three weeks ago.

17:08.362 --> 17:10.656
Sweetheart, none of this is your fault.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.032
And the sooner we figure it out,
the better, yeah?

17:13.534 --> 17:16.828
You pooped your pants? Roy Kent?

17:17.579 --> 17:19.248
Yeah, so?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.291
I do too, sometimes.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.505
Well… let's both try
and knock that off, shall we?

17:27.673 --> 17:29.091
If you can do it, I can do it.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.553
-Cool?
-Cool.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.057
Merry Christmas!

17:37.558 --> 17:38.767
-Bye!
-Come on.

17:42.688 --> 17:43.897
Go, go, go, go, go!

17:50.571 --> 17:52.114
We're not gonna make it.

17:52.197 --> 17:54.324
Tell my incredibly
beautiful wife I love her.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.327
I'm not gonna do that,
'cause you'll tell her yourself.

17:57.411 --> 18:00.664
Then you're gonna hook me up
with her identical, beautiful twin sister.

18:00.747 --> 18:01.957
Good luck, mi amigo.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.375
Bonne chance, mon ami.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.339
Eat Nerf!

18:38.911 --> 18:40.120
Richard.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.582
Why did you bring a date
to the team Christmas party?

18:44.082 --> 18:47.044
The French believe that having
a beautiful woman around

18:47.669 --> 18:49.046
is always a good thing.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.967
That was not true
with the Helter Skelter murders.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.264
Hey!

18:59.348 --> 19:01.016
-Cheers, darling.
-Cheers.

19:01.099 --> 19:04.311
-Hey!
-You've become quite popular, Leslie.

19:04.394 --> 19:06.647
This is by far the most people
we've ever had.

19:06.730 --> 19:08.690
-Merry Christmas!
-Hey!

19:08.774 --> 19:10.359
-Welcome, guys!
-Merry Christmas!

19:10.442 --> 19:12.528
Well, at least we've got
plenty of food and drink.

19:12.611 --> 19:13.862
Yeah.

19:13.946 --> 19:16.532
But where are we all
gonna sit down and eat it?

19:55.279 --> 19:59.408
Mom! There are two white people
at the door and they're smiling!

20:00.909 --> 20:03.203
-Can I help you?
-Good afternoon.

20:03.287 --> 20:07.916
We work for Santa Claus,
and I believe he received this.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.001
My letter.

20:09.084 --> 20:13.088
Yes, we're terribly sorry that
your presents didn't arrive last night.

20:13.172 --> 20:17.634
But as elves we've been personally
directed by Mr. and Mrs. Claus

20:17.718 --> 20:21.597
to deliver your presents this afternoon
and to apologize for the delay.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.473
Am I forgetting anything?

20:24.850 --> 20:28.228
Well, you see what happened was
Rudolph's nose shined so brightly

20:28.312 --> 20:30.272
that it rendered me
unable to see, and I was--

20:30.355 --> 20:32.232
I was delirious for several minutes.

20:32.316 --> 20:35.694
And I ended up putting this
whole sack of goodies on the wrong sled.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.155
I mean, you know, ain't that nuts?

20:38.238 --> 20:39.990
Anyway, this bad boy's been
around the world

20:40.073 --> 20:42.326
at least twice over the past day so…

20:42.409 --> 20:44.494
Yeah, you smell that?
That's the Himalayas right there.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.829
That's all for you.

20:45.913 --> 20:47.706
Am I getting notes of Beijing?

20:47.789 --> 20:48.916
I bet you are, yeah.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.127
-Thank you.
-You're so welcome.

20:52.669 --> 20:54.671
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

20:57.341 --> 21:00.427
-On to the next?
-Heck yeah.

21:30.499 --> 21:34.628
-Hey, guys! Amazing! Amazing!
-Hey!

21:37.422 --> 21:39.258
House number ten, Uncle Roy.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.218
Oi, Phoebs. We can't lose.

21:41.301 --> 21:45.222
Either we find out why your breath
is so rancid, or we get £1,000!

21:45.305 --> 21:48.475
Each!
That's like a month worth of swear words.

21:48.559 --> 21:50.519
Hold on, I've gotta fix my knee.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.150
Are you Roy Kent?

21:57.234 --> 21:58.986
Yeah. Are you a dentist?

21:59.069 --> 22:00.112
Yeah.

22:00.696 --> 22:01.822
Can we come in?

22:01.905 --> 22:04.783
Thank you so much.
This will only take a second.

22:04.867 --> 22:06.285
Your house is lovely!

22:18.005 --> 22:23.760
Well, congratulations, Phoebe.
That is some spectacularly bad breath.

22:23.844 --> 22:25.179
Thank you.

22:25.262 --> 22:28.599
Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?

22:28.682 --> 22:31.351
Not if I do my breathing exercises.

22:32.144 --> 22:33.478
Have you been smoking?

22:33.562 --> 22:34.646
No!

22:35.939 --> 22:37.441
Any new medications?

22:38.275 --> 22:39.985
Just my antihistamines.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.904
They got a new cat. She's allergic.

22:41.987 --> 22:43.697
Her name is Dauphine.

22:43.780 --> 22:48.368
My mum said that we rescued her,
but I'd like to think that she rescued us.

22:48.452 --> 22:50.704
Well, that's it then, Phoebe.

22:50.787 --> 22:55.250
Antihistamines dry out the mouth,
and when saliva production is reduced,

22:55.334 --> 22:58.545
then the environment
for odor-producing bacteria thrives.

22:58.629 --> 23:00.506
And thrive it has.

23:00.589 --> 23:04.051
Might be time
to say au revoir to Dauphine.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.511
-No!
-Come on, Phoebe.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.722
-You've only had her a month.
-But we're soul mates.

23:08.805 --> 23:13.644
Phoebe, no one is gonna make you
get rid of Dauphine. Okay?

23:13.727 --> 23:16.396
Because that would be
an insane thing for your uncle,

23:16.480 --> 23:21.193
who loves you and
who is not a monster, to suggest.

23:22.194 --> 23:24.446
And I'm sure Dr. Rogers
has another solution

23:24.530 --> 23:29.034
because she's nice and smart,
and science is real, and it's Christmas!

23:29.117 --> 23:30.744
-Right?
-Yeah.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.163
Thank you!

23:33.747 --> 23:35.749
Yo! Can I get an ussie?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.085
Fine.

23:38.168 --> 23:40.087
Not with you, mate. With Keeley.

23:40.170 --> 23:43.048
I mean, you're a legend at Chelsea
but shit at Richmond.

23:43.131 --> 23:46.301
But Keeley Jones was a seminal figure
throughout my teenage years.

23:46.385 --> 23:49.805
How about this, why don't we all
take a picture together?

23:49.888 --> 23:51.265
By the tree.

23:51.348 --> 23:52.349
Wicked!

24:00.607 --> 24:01.817
Un, deux, trois.

24:03.694 --> 24:05.362
You brought jollof.

24:06.196 --> 24:10.075
-With goat meat? Yes!
-Original.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.535
You want to try some goat?

24:11.618 --> 24:13.245
Okay. Are you sure?

24:15.372 --> 24:16.373
Oh, no!

24:19.710 --> 24:21.378
Oh, no!

24:22.254 --> 24:23.547
-Yes!
-No!

24:23.630 --> 24:24.631
I never win.

24:31.847 --> 24:32.848
Cheers.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.228
-Merry Christmas.
-Thank you.

24:38.312 --> 24:39.521
You're welcome.

24:39.605 --> 24:42.900
See, doesn't it feel better to solve
the problem than go beat up a little kid?

24:46.945 --> 24:49.698
Oi, you got any poster board and markers?

24:52.326 --> 24:53.827
For another hundred quid.

24:56.997 --> 24:58.498
Cheers.

25:02.252 --> 25:05.464
That was pretty dang neat.
Thanks for letting me tag along.

25:06.340 --> 25:07.341
My pleasure.

25:07.424 --> 25:11.929
-How long have you been doing this?
-For years, but then Rupert…

25:13.430 --> 25:18.018
You know, I should have done it last year,
but I just sat by myself instead.

25:18.101 --> 25:21.146
Drinking and plotting horrible things.

25:21.230 --> 25:22.439
Oh, yeah? Like what?

25:24.733 --> 25:28.153
Look, I know all too well
how stunningly shitty

25:28.237 --> 25:30.864
the first Christmas
after you get divorced can be.

25:30.948 --> 25:32.824
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

25:32.908 --> 25:34.952
Yeah, well, I am now, you know.

25:35.035 --> 25:37.913
A lot better than I would have been
if I just drank whiskey all day

25:37.996 --> 25:40.624
and watched
It's a Wonderful Life on repeat.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.000
That could have gone dark.

25:43.669 --> 25:46.380
So, what now?

25:46.463 --> 25:48.590
I figured you could just
drop me off at home

25:48.674 --> 25:51.677
and then go get all decked out
for Sir Elton's party.

25:52.803 --> 25:54.930
-I might not go.
-Really?

25:55.013 --> 25:57.766
You're willing to miss a puppet show
by Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz?

25:57.850 --> 26:02.062
-'Cause that sounds like a lot of fun.
-Don't get me wrong, they are incredible.

26:02.145 --> 26:05.190
But all I really want to see
those two do together is fuck.

26:05.274 --> 26:08.360
Yeah, no. I get that. Yeah.
You got any other ideas then?

26:08.443 --> 26:10.988
-You'll see.
-You want me to drive?

26:11.488 --> 26:14.449
-The steering wheel's on this side.
-Right, I'm the one with the accent here.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.868
I forgot. Sorry.

26:19.371 --> 26:20.581
Who is it?

26:23.750 --> 26:25.335
It's carol singers.

26:25.419 --> 26:28.422
Just give 'em a quid
and tell 'em to bugger off.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.456
I'm sorry.

27:14.176 --> 27:15.260
I'm sorry, Phoebe.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.247
I just wanna thank you all for coming.

27:43.914 --> 27:45.666
To the family Higgins!

27:49.795 --> 27:51.046
You're gonna make me cry.

27:52.798 --> 27:56.051
To my lovely wife, Julie, my sons…

27:57.052 --> 28:01.348
To you and all your families
back in Lagos, Guadalajara,

28:01.431 --> 28:05.894
Groningen, Cordon, Montreal,

28:05.978 --> 28:09.064
Benin City, Harare, Kingston…

28:09.147 --> 28:10.190
Ya, man.

28:10.274 --> 28:11.817
…and Santa Cruz de la Sierra.

28:14.194 --> 28:15.320
Hear! Hear!

28:15.404 --> 28:17.531
I know you would have preferred
to have been with them,

28:17.614 --> 28:20.868
but it was truly an honor
to have you with us

28:20.951 --> 28:23.829
to share our traditions
and help make a few new ones.

28:24.955 --> 28:30.586
To the family we're born with
and to the family we make along the way.

28:30.669 --> 28:34.131
And most importantly to Richmond!

28:34.214 --> 28:36.341
To Richmond!

28:40.262 --> 28:42.306
-What's happening outside?
-I don't know.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.473
What's that?

28:45.058 --> 28:47.352
Ho ho ho, Higginses!

28:56.236 --> 29:01.950
-Oh, oh
-Christmas

29:02.034 --> 29:05.495
-The snow's coming down
-Christmas

29:05.579 --> 29:09.208
-I'm watching it fall
-Christmas

29:09.291 --> 29:12.336
-Lots of people around
-Christmas

29:12.419 --> 29:15.047
Baby, please come home

29:15.130 --> 29:18.175
They're singing "Deck The Halls"

29:18.258 --> 29:21.637
But it ain't like Christmas at all

29:21.720 --> 29:25.182
'Cause I remember when you were here

29:25.265 --> 29:29.728
-And all the fun that we had last year
-Christmas

29:29.811 --> 29:33.148
-Pretty lights on the tree
-Christmas

29:33.232 --> 29:36.193
-I'm watching them shine
-Christmas

29:36.276 --> 29:39.905
-Oh, you should be here with me
-Christmas

29:39.988 --> 29:42.616
-Baby, please come home
-Christmas

29:43.909 --> 29:45.452
Ho ho ho ho!

29:47.663 --> 29:51.583
-Baby, please come home
-Christmas

29:51.667 --> 29:55.754
-Oh, whoo
-Christmas

29:58.006 --> 30:01.301
Oh, oh

30:01.385 --> 30:04.805
Baby, please come home

30:04.888 --> 30:10.602
-Baby, please, please
-Christmas

30:10.686 --> 30:13.939
-The church bells in town
-Christmas

30:14.022 --> 30:16.984
All ringing in song
