[gasps] Oh, no. I thought getting here
was the hard part,

but it turns out we've got
a town full of problems,

01:55.208 --> 01:59.417

She's supposed to play Joseph.

03:21.458 --> 03:22.875
Uh… no.

03:22.958 --> 03:25.958
And finally, our local rebel, Bernadette.

Don't worry, Sam, she'll show up.
We've got loads of time.

03:42.042 --> 03:44.458
If she doesn't, you can do her part.
Here, start warming up.

03:44.542 --> 03:46.333
Oh, no. No, no, no.

03:46.417 --> 03:49.333
You wrote it. You know the lines
and you're identical twins.

03:49.417 --> 03:52.458
So, from a DNA perspective,
you're basically interchangeable.

03:52.542 --> 03:56.042
No. Wait, Bernadette. In fact,
Charlie and I are actually very different.

10:58.708 --> 11:00.708
-Being good.
-[Charlie groans]

11:00.792 --> 11:03.792
Don't you think you should tidy
those things up before Santa comes?

11:03.875 --> 11:05.542
Oh, found it.

11:07.417 --> 11:08.250
Wow.

11:08.333 --> 11:09.208
-Those are new.
-Yep.

11:09.292 --> 11:10.750
Just dropping a hint for Santa.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.708
I like those shiny guitars too.

11:12.792 --> 11:14.458
In fact, it's top of my wish list.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.542
Those are not "shiny guitars".

11:16.625 --> 11:19.375
They are Single Cone National Resonators.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.917
And there you go.

11:22.000 --> 11:24.542
"Santa, gimme or else…"

11:24.625 --> 11:25.750
Or else what?

11:25.833 --> 11:29.208
Or else I'll catch him in a sack
and I'll shave off his beard.

11:29.292 --> 11:31.083
You can't blackmail Santa, Charlie.

11:31.167 --> 11:33.167
Oh, don't stress, Samski.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.417
The fat present dispenser gets me.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.208
[gasps] Oh, look.

11:37.292 --> 11:39.292
It really is snowing now.

11:39.375 --> 11:40.542
[gasps]

11:41.125 --> 11:43.333
Wow, so pretty.

11:43.417 --> 11:45.667
Yeah. Pretty big fun in store.

11:45.750 --> 11:50.333
[sighs] With you, Charlie,
big fun always means big trouble.

11:50.417 --> 11:52.292
-[gasps] Oh, no.
-What?

11:52.875 --> 11:55.500
Don't tell me
that was Buddy's hair in your beard?

11:55.583 --> 11:57.542
Come on! You're all wet and cold.

11:57.625 --> 11:58.458
Maybe.

11:58.542 --> 12:00.708
Seriously. If you do
one more naughty thing,

12:00.792 --> 12:03.000
Santa won't leave you any presents at all

12:03.083 --> 12:07.458
and then it'll be
the worst Christmas ever.

12:08.167 --> 12:10.208
[Santa] Right. So you get the picture.

12:10.292 --> 12:13.625
Christmas was knocking
on Wellington's front door.

12:13.708 --> 12:18.583
And everything was about to get
a lot more complicated.

12:18.667 --> 12:19.708
Blimey.

12:19.792 --> 12:23.458
[Santa] Snow can be a very mixed blessing.

12:34.708 --> 12:35.542
Wow.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.208
Snow day?

-Death to Trapper's terrible test! Ow!

12:42.958 --> 12:45.083

-Ugh. Not happening.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.042
Morning, darling.

12:46.125 --> 12:47.000
Don't say it.

12:47.083 --> 12:50.208
Absolutely love snow day!

12:50.292 --> 12:52.208
-And you said it.
-Snow day!

12:52.292 --> 12:54.917
-Let the snowball fight-ageddon begin.
-Yay!

Good morning! I can't believe I'm so late!

13:32.625 --> 13:35.167
Good luck at school today, Danno.
And don't you be late!

13:35.750 --> 13:36.708
I won't.

13:41.167 --> 13:43.083

13:43.625 --> 13:45.458

13:45.542 --> 13:47.542
That's some serious snow.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.833
[ringing]

13:50.917 --> 13:52.583
Thanks for the tea and toast, eh.

13:52.667 --> 13:55.375
You're welcome.
You were late last night. Hot date?

13:55.458 --> 13:58.042
Yes, with a 78-year-old on a bed pan.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.167
Speaking of hot dates,

13:59.250 --> 14:01.292
how's the Sam Romance Campaign going?

14:01.375 --> 14:04.458
There's no campaign, Mum.
It's been six months.

14:04.542 --> 14:08.417
I'm still the invisible new boy.
Except to Terrifying Ms. Trapper I'm not.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.167
Well, if love was easy

14:10.250 --> 14:13.042
your father wouldn't have run off
with his 25-year-old dental nurse.

14:13.125 --> 14:16.042
Mum. Don't be like that
when he comes back, okay?

14:16.125 --> 14:18.542
I just want a fun Christmas.
Like we used to have.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.375
I know, sweetheart. But you know what?

14:20.458 --> 14:23.042
It's only a matter of time
before you sweep Sam off her feet

14:23.125 --> 14:25.542
and blaze off into the sunset
on your monster truck.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.792
Plenty of holes in that plan.

14:27.875 --> 14:32.125
Not a big girl sweeper-upper
and total lack of truck.

14:32.208 --> 14:33.833
Well, insignificant details.

I'm shy, she's anxious. It's hopeless.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.167
Whew.

14:47.083 --> 14:48.833
Everyone, come on out!

15:21.708 --> 15:23.417
Not so fast, Williams.

15:25.375 --> 15:26.500
Hello, Ms. Trapper.

15:26.583 --> 15:28.417
Hello, Williams.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.958
There's no one here.

15:31.042 --> 15:32.292
Indeed.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.667
I'd better go then.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.083
-Unless you don't.
-Sorry?

15:37.167 --> 15:40.208
I assume you're here
because your mother went to work early

15:40.292 --> 15:41.792
and didn't receive the message.

15:41.875 --> 15:45.208
So, you are free
to catch up on your studies.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.167
Well… Maybe.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.417
Let me remind you
of your current scholastic status.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.333
Chemistry, 15th out of 16.

15:53.417 --> 15:56.750
Maths, 16th out of 16.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.083
Want me to continue?

15:58.875 --> 16:00.208
Not really.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.333
Very wise. Inside please, Master Williams.

16:03.417 --> 16:05.458
-[kids laughing]
-I'm going to get you!

16:05.542 --> 16:07.125
-This means war!
-Teddy, duck!

16:07.208 --> 16:08.708
-Oof.
-Oh!

16:08.792 --> 16:10.000
Right in the pie-hole.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.625
Revenge!

16:11.708 --> 16:13.125
-Throw me, Bernie!
-[chuckles]

16:13.625 --> 16:17.417
Are we at all worried about leaving
poor Bernie with all our little monsters

16:17.500 --> 16:18.833
when we go to the wedding tomorrow?

16:18.917 --> 16:21.583
A bit, but… No.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.542
She's pretty much an adult now
and she can be very responsible.

16:24.625 --> 16:27.208

-Parent attack!

16:27.292 --> 16:29.000
-Sometimes.
-Ha!

16:29.083 --> 16:31.167
Mm. I have my doubts.

16:31.250 --> 16:32.958
She will get distracted by Netflix

16:33.042 --> 16:35.375
and let the little ones start fires…

-Oh.

16:38.042 --> 16:42.708
So, 2x squared minus 5y plus 7y is…

16:42.792 --> 16:46.458

who was executed because she…

16:46.542 --> 16:48.833
…mixed acid with alkaline and then…

16:48.917 --> 16:53.667
…defined space-time singularities
in her native Sanskrit.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.417
With your eyes closed?

17:03.000 --> 17:06.375
Well, that's my most intense
kind of concentration.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.583
If you had been concentrating
on your physics lessons, Williams,

18:42.667 --> 18:45.125
you would know
that if an object of greater mass

18:45.208 --> 18:48.583
is placed upon one of less great mass,
you get mush.

18:49.167 --> 18:54.083
You need to make the lower snowball
larger than the upper one.

Now, time for physics.

20:13.417 --> 20:14.708
Yes, Miss.

20:18.208 --> 20:21.708
Or you could do more practical physics

20:21.792 --> 20:24.458
and build this gentleman

22:36.083 --> 22:37.333
[sighs]

22:40.500 --> 22:42.042
[Santa] Ah, poor Danny.

22:42.125 --> 22:45.333
It's hard making new friends
sometimes, isn't it?

22:45.417 --> 22:46.833
[distant kid] Wait for me, guys.

22:46.917 --> 22:52.625
I always think that Christmas is a bit
like an emotional magnifying glass.

22:52.708 --> 22:56.167
If you feel loved and happy,
Christmas will make you feel

22:56.250 --> 22:58.625
even happier and more loved.

22:59.750 --> 23:05.125
But if you feel alone and unloved,
the magnifier gets to work

23:05.208 --> 23:09.000
and makes all those bad things
bigger and worse.

23:10.667 --> 23:16.875
And the last thing anyone needs
is a blizzard making things even trickier.

23:21.542 --> 23:23.500
[snoring softly]

23:24.042 --> 23:26.375
See, I told you the storm
would be over by the time we leave.

23:26.458 --> 23:28.167
Look, it's clearing up.

23:28.250 --> 23:29.083
Tragically.

23:29.167 --> 23:31.708
Right, Bernadette, you're in charge.

23:31.792 --> 23:34.583
Great. More whooping it up, people.

23:34.667 --> 23:38.250
After you've done all the things
on the Christmas Eve to do list.

23:39.667 --> 23:41.125
Okay.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.167
So it's going to be exactly
the same as always?

23:43.250 --> 23:45.250
Of course. All the traditions.

23:45.333 --> 23:48.833
Turkey lunch, lovely old Christmas film,
lovely Christmas walk.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.750
Absolutely love the tradition
of traditional traditions.

23:51.833 --> 23:53.708
[chuckles] Everyone does.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.750
But do they? Completely sure about that?

23:55.833 --> 23:57.458
Well yes, I think we are.

23:57.542 --> 24:00.167
When did you start wanting
to change Christmas, Bernie?

24:00.250 --> 24:01.958
When I stopped being six, Mum.

24:02.042 --> 24:05.833
Okay, well, be that as it may,
just get the jobs done. That's your job.

24:05.917 --> 24:08.042
Get the job done, Bernie.

24:08.125 --> 24:10.042
Then wonderful Christmas begins

24:10.125 --> 24:12.208
-the moment we're back.
-[whoops]

24:12.292 --> 24:13.125
Oh.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.458
Oh, sorry. I thought…
I thought we were all going to whoop.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.708
Oh, no. I never whoop.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.667
[all overlapping] Bye-bye.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.583
Bye, kids!

24:22.125 --> 24:24.000
-Bye, Dad!
-Have a nice night!

24:24.750 --> 24:26.875
Well, at least we have
eight parent-free hours.

24:26.958 --> 24:29.500
Yes! Eight kid-free hours!

24:29.583 --> 24:31.333
Absolutely love kids.

24:31.417 --> 24:34.167
But it's nice to get away
from them sometimes.

24:34.250 --> 24:36.500
-Huh?
-[Mr. McNutt] Whoa.

24:36.583 --> 24:37.458
Aww.

24:37.542 --> 24:41.000
Nice try, Eve McQueen,
my little escape artist.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.125
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.500
Bye again…

24:45.000 --> 24:46.417
Okay, fellow inmates,

24:46.500 --> 24:49.000

-Yeouch.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.083
[Mr. McNutt] Absolutely love ferries.

24:57.167 --> 24:59.917

giving a car a piggy back.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.125
You love paperclips.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.292
Oh, yeah, I really love paperclips.

25:03.375 --> 25:05.708

of holding things together.

25:05.792 --> 25:09.958
Is it just me or are those
very dark clouds on the horizon?

25:10.042 --> 25:11.458
Hmm.

25:14.792 --> 25:18.250

you were wrong.

25:18.333 --> 25:20.208
Here comes The Big Blizzard Two.

25:20.292 --> 25:22.917
The sequel is heading south

25:23.000 --> 25:25.875
and it's definitely getting worse!
[screams]

25:26.458 --> 25:28.750
[Mrs. Beccles]
Oh yes, I suppose so. Okay, yes.

25:28.833 --> 25:29.917
I know.

25:30.000 --> 25:33.375
All right, well good luck.
And thank you, Angie.

25:33.458 --> 25:35.625
Right, we have a major situation.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.542
What? What is it?

25:36.625 --> 25:37.792
The snow has cut off the town

25:37.875 --> 25:39.625
and the butcher
didn't get his Christmas delivery,

25:39.708 --> 25:42.708
and that means Farmer Yirrell
is the only one with fresh turkeys so…

25:42.792 --> 25:46.792
No. Yirrell is the worst.
He's a truly terrible turkey torturer.

25:46.875 --> 25:49.167
And he used to call me names at school.

25:49.250 --> 25:51.875
Nevertheless, we can't
have Christmas without a turkey.

25:51.958 --> 25:53.417
Why not? They deserve to live.

25:53.500 --> 25:56.625
Because without turkeys,
it just wouldn't be Christmas.

25:56.708 --> 26:00.042
[Sam] Can't we celebrate without a turkey?
We can make an aubergine or…

26:00.125 --> 26:03.000
[Mr. Beccles]
Charlie! Charlie, my lovely girl.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.333

26:15.375 --> 26:17.917
Ho-ho! Well, well, well, here they come.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.792
Here they darn well come.

26:19.875 --> 26:23.000
Time to turn meat into money.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.250
Easy now, there's turkeys for everyone.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.958
Someone should do something
about this hellhole.

26:29.042 --> 26:30.583
They really should.

26:30.667 --> 26:34.125
Just as a matter of interest, Mr. Yirrell,
what are you charging?

26:34.208 --> 26:37.500
Oh, you know me, Specky-Beccles.
[wicked chuckle]

26:37.583 --> 26:39.250
Only double the normal price.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.625
-[both] Double?
-For the small ones, yeah.

26:41.708 --> 26:43.000
Triple for the chunkadunks,

26:43.083 --> 26:46.500
on account of the recent fluctuation
in market conditions.

26:46.583 --> 26:47.542
[Mr. Beccles] Is that legal?

26:47.625 --> 26:49.125
Thing is, we need the turkey.

26:49.208 --> 26:52.042
-Cash payments only. I will be donating…
-[whistling]

[Yirrell] Do you have enough change?

27:04.417 --> 27:05.250

27:06.042 --> 27:07.750
Come to mama.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.958
[Yirrell] Places, please.
No fighting, folks,

27:10.042 --> 27:11.708
-or I'll get out me cattle prod.
-[straining]

-Yes!

27:15.417 --> 27:19.667

-[Sam] Mr. Yirrell, uh…
-Huh?

27:25.667 --> 27:29.875
I don't want to delay you,
but are those t-turkeys free range?

27:29.958 --> 27:34.375
Well, yes, they're free to range
all around their… cage. Yeah.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.000
-And, um… corn fed?
-Eh?

Except the turkeys.
I imagine this rather made their day.

28:31.667 --> 28:33.625
Well, yes, nice for the turkeys,

28:33.708 --> 28:35.917
but Santa's now definitely
not coming to you.

28:36.000 --> 28:38.958
And can't you see
that spoils everything for me as well

28:39.042 --> 28:42.042
because… because it spoils it for you.

28:45.417 --> 28:46.500

for when Dad gets here.

28:51.542 --> 28:54.542
Exactly. With extra slop on top.

your Dad will have so much fun together.

a little gift for your dad

just get it down.

33:26.625 --> 33:27.708
[Mrs. McNutt] Okay.

33:27.792 --> 33:29.125

-Turkeys?

34:09.000 --> 34:10.417
Hi, guys. What's up?

34:10.500 --> 34:13.042
So, um, there's been a tiny hiccup,

34:13.125 --> 34:16.875
and it looks like we may not
make it back tonight.

34:16.958 --> 34:18.458
You won't be home for Christmas?

34:18.542 --> 34:21.125

34:21.208 --> 34:23.083
It's a possibility.

34:23.167 --> 34:25.250
Mum, what happened to your hair?

Uh, yes, it's nothing.

Uh, so, Bernadette,

34:31.250 --> 34:33.583
you'll all have to stay together
in the barn, okay?

34:33.667 --> 34:35.958
Right, but what about
our Christmas stockings?

34:36.042 --> 34:38.458
Save some phone power to call for help.

34:38.542 --> 34:40.000
You'll have to improvise.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.583
Lock all the doors and stay together.

34:41.667 --> 34:43.708
Nobody goes outside
until we're back. Okay?

34:43.792 --> 34:44.625
Really?

34:44.708 --> 34:47.542
-Teddy, lock the door.
-Yes, boss.

34:48.458 --> 34:51.708
[sighs] We'll be fine.
I think we'll be fine…

34:51.792 --> 34:53.500
Just remember to keep an eye on Evie,

34:53.583 --> 34:56.167
and I'm sure we'll be back by morning.

-Seriously?

35:12.000 --> 35:13.250
Here, let me help.

Okay?

Oh, it can't be that bad.

Oh, it's-- it's… It's that bad.

Only if you want to lose your toes,

35:33.875 --> 35:36.792

to certain frostbite.

35:36.875 --> 35:39.375
No. We must stay in the van.

35:40.292 --> 35:42.917
I can't believe we won't be there
for Santa and the stockings.

35:43.000 --> 35:44.500
Oh, you shouldn't worry about that.

35:44.583 --> 35:45.417
Shouldn't I?

35:45.500 --> 35:48.167
No, you should worry about
freezing to death out here

35:48.250 --> 35:50.458
and never seeing another Christmas
of any kind.

35:50.542 --> 35:51.833
-Righto.
-[laughs]

35:51.917 --> 35:55.125

Oh no.

this ridiculous old van after Beyoncé?

36:04.125 --> 36:06.417
No, no. I mean, not that Beyoncé.

Oh, the snow.

36:26.250 --> 36:27.750
Yeah, it's really bad out there.

36:27.833 --> 36:28.833
Right.

36:28.917 --> 36:30.542
I'll try to make it there
for the New Years.

-You won't be too sad, will you?
-No.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.833
We'll make up for it next year, okay?
It will be great.

43:41.875 --> 43:43.000
Clever.

43:44.167 --> 43:46.083
[chuckles] Perfect.

43:48.875 --> 43:52.250
Over to you now, mighty Bernadette.

43:53.208 --> 43:55.208
[alarm whooping faintly]

43:56.792 --> 44:00.208
Now, problem number three,
the hardest of the lot,

44:00.292 --> 44:03.292
a pair of twins, one's been very good,
but the other is…

44:03.375 --> 44:05.833
The evil twin.
There's always an evil twin.

44:05.917 --> 44:09.333
No, not evil,
but she's definitely been very naughty.

44:09.417 --> 44:10.333
What to do?

44:10.417 --> 44:12.708
Ah, just flip a coin.

44:12.792 --> 44:14.792
We've still got Finland, Sweden

44:14.875 --> 44:16.542
and that other one
with all the lederhosen to do.

44:16.625 --> 44:19.042
Don't rush me. This really matters.

44:19.125 --> 44:22.000
Where would we be
if everyone was naughty all the time?

44:22.625 --> 44:24.625
[snoring softly]

44:30.375 --> 44:31.250

44:32.000 --> 44:33.583

44:33.667 --> 44:35.667
[snoring continues]

44:39.042 --> 44:40.458
[mutters softly]

44:41.667 --> 44:43.833
"Refused to tidy her room."

44:43.917 --> 44:47.125
"Shaved a dog to make a beard"
and-- [gasps] good lord,

44:47.833 --> 44:50.417
"Released
all of Farmer Yirrell's turkeys."

44:56.250 --> 44:57.875
Oh, get on with it, boss.

44:57.958 --> 45:00.792
My unmentionables
are turning into snowballs out here.

45:00.875 --> 45:05.250
[sighs] Alas, alas, but it must be done.

45:07.417 --> 45:10.625
[Santa] For all the talk
of who's naughty and who's nice,

45:10.708 --> 45:13.458
it's actually incredibly rare for me

45:13.542 --> 45:18.708
to follow through with an empty stocking
on actual Christmas night.

45:20.500 --> 45:23.583
Oh, dear, that's a dreadful thing to do.

45:23.667 --> 45:27.208
Right, where to next? Jamaica? Barbados?

45:27.292 --> 45:28.708
No. Iceland.

45:28.792 --> 45:30.458
-[shudders]
-Hip, hip.

45:31.958 --> 45:34.875

Did you forget Finland again?

46:56.125 --> 46:59.042
[gasps] No, it's wonderful news.

46:59.125 --> 47:01.250
Sorry pal, it's going to be a long night.

47:01.333 --> 47:02.792
Long night?

47:02.875 --> 47:05.542
It's already been one endless,

47:05.625 --> 47:07.750

and eat them long night.

47:07.833 --> 47:10.833
Well, it's about to get longer.
And marvelous!

47:11.417 --> 47:13.750
[sighs] So where are we going, big man?

47:13.833 --> 47:15.625
Back to Wellington-on-Sea.

47:15.708 --> 47:18.792
The naughty twin
turns out not to be naughty after all.

47:18.875 --> 47:22.792
Oh! This is my first
Code Red for fifty years!

47:22.875 --> 47:24.708
Code Red? Nice.

47:24.792 --> 47:27.375
Let's dust off one of these old beauties.

47:27.875 --> 47:30.750
Right, time is tight.
[chuckles triumphantly]

47:30.833 --> 47:33.333
Let's blow a hole in the sky, baby.

47:33.417 --> 47:34.500
All righty then.

47:34.583 --> 47:37.667
I've got a little bit more
left in the tank. Check this.

47:37.750 --> 47:38.750
Whoa!

Yeah, you got the guitar!

48:00.000 --> 48:01.833
But why aren't you opening yours?

48:01.917 --> 48:04.375
Well, I wasn't so lucky.
[soft chuckle]

48:04.458 --> 48:05.708
What do you mean?

48:05.792 --> 48:09.125
I guess I was too naughty after all.
I should have been less…

48:09.208 --> 48:11.375

Brace yourself.

[rapid footsteps approaching]

48:24.208 --> 48:25.750

48:25.833 --> 48:27.458
I got a full stocking.

Oh, yes.

This is amazing!

-Oh!

48:42.708 --> 48:45.042
No way. Drumsticks!

48:45.125 --> 48:47.458
Oh, there's something left in Charlie's.

48:47.542 --> 48:48.708
Is there?

48:48.792 --> 48:49.917
I thought I felt something.

48:50.750 --> 48:52.333
Um… uh…

48:52.833 --> 48:53.667
I don't think so.

48:53.750 --> 48:55.958
Mum, it's just what I've always wanted.

48:56.042 --> 48:57.708
Oh, yes, isn't it?

48:57.792 --> 48:59.708
[Santa] Officially nice.

49:00.708 --> 49:02.083
You did find something.

49:02.167 --> 49:04.458
No. I-It was nothing.

49:04.542 --> 49:05.542
Oh, okay.

49:05.625 --> 49:07.542
Mum, listen to what I learnt at school.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.917
Flipping heck.

49:47.458 --> 49:49.458
[grunts] Huh?

49:50.125 --> 49:52.417
Mummy? Daddy?

49:53.375 --> 49:56.167
Oh, no, they're not back.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.500
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

49:57.583 --> 49:59.417
-[thud]
-Oof! Oh, gosh.

50:01.917 --> 50:03.583
Or it's not.

50:03.667 --> 50:06.417
Look in your stockings. Santa came.

50:06.500 --> 50:07.500
-What?
-Really?

50:07.583 --> 50:10.958
And he's left
some very interesting things.

50:12.292 --> 50:14.833
A blaster gun? Weird.

50:14.917 --> 50:16.833
A power washer? Double weird.

50:16.917 --> 50:18.917
A karaoke machine?

50:19.000 --> 50:20.042
Hmm…

50:20.125 --> 50:22.125
Whippedy cream!

50:22.208 --> 50:23.417
Bit weird.

50:23.500 --> 50:24.667
[Eve] What's that?

50:24.750 --> 50:26.083
-[Scarlett] I don't get it.
-[Teddy] Well, duh.

50:26.167 --> 50:29.958
Everyone, it's Christmas morning
and our parents are nowhere to be seen,

50:30.042 --> 50:34.250
which could be a problem, true,
but it seems to me

50:34.333 --> 50:37.833
Santa's gifts are asking
a very intriguing question.

50:38.417 --> 50:40.750
Do we always love everything
about the Christmas arrangements?

50:40.833 --> 50:41.667
-Hmm…
-Um…

50:41.750 --> 50:43.750

-Yes!

["Silent Night" playing]

51:08.167 --> 51:09.708

51:09.792 --> 51:11.958
I hate the lovely old Christmas film.

51:12.042 --> 51:15.542
Exactly as I thought.
Do we think we could do a lot better?

51:15.625 --> 51:16.875
-Definitely.
-Um, yes.

51:16.958 --> 51:20.667
Right, so, big moment, kids. Big moment.

51:20.750 --> 51:23.625
One of those moments
that defines who we are.

51:23.708 --> 51:25.542
Do we have a vision for the future

51:25.625 --> 51:29.375
that is better and brighter
and always more fun?

[all] Yes!

the lighthouse keeper?

Uh-uh.

52:28.292 --> 52:30.750
Well, his Mum might be dying.

52:30.833 --> 52:32.625
And that's not fun.

52:32.708 --> 52:35.875
She likes me
and she doesn't like many people.

52:35.958 --> 52:39.875

you don't like holding your hand.

01:06:06.292 --> 01:06:07.250
Oh…

Mum, you're here.

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:33.792
I don't know what to say.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:36.500
Then don't say anything.

01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:38.625
Just step inside, Nurse Williams,

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:42.583
and enjoy a very special Christmas dinner
with your most excellent son.

01:06:46.250 --> 01:06:47.292

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:49.333
Will you join us?

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Uh, maybe next year.

01:06:52.083 --> 01:06:56.333
I-I've got some catching up to do
with my own family.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:00.792
Ms. Trapper, are you sure?

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:03.833
Merry Christmas, Williams.

01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:08.250
It's time to celebrate the wins
and live with the losses.

01:07:11.875 --> 01:07:13.292

Come here.

01:07:26.083 --> 01:07:28.083
We're going to be so fine.

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:31.125
I think so too.

-First to the little girls' room.
-Whew.

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:30.208

-[gasps]
-What on Earth has happened here?

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:37.958
Oh, no! We've been burgled!

01:08:38.042 --> 01:08:39.500
You're home!

01:08:39.583 --> 01:08:41.750
-You're back!
-[laughs]

01:08:41.833 --> 01:08:44.917
Oh, Nisha beta, I'm so sorry.
Please forgive me.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.667
[crying] I'll never leave you alone
at Christmas again.

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:50.042
-Mummy!
-I love you, sweetie.

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:54.792
And clearly you managed to have some fun.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:57.417
-Yeah. Bernie was fantastic.
-We had a disco!

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.333
-She is my absolute hero.
-Aw…

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:03.042
Well, there's nothing quite as good
as a traditional Christmas, is there?

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:04.667
There certainly isn't.

01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:06.125
[giggling]

01:09:07.958 --> 01:09:09.625
Wait a minute. Where's Evie?

01:09:09.708 --> 01:09:11.917
-Yeah. Where is that little pumpkin?
-Evie!

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.292
-Evie! Come out!
-Why is the door unlocked?

01:09:15.375 --> 01:09:17.167
-Eve!
-Evie!

01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:18.167
Eve.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:20.000
[wind whistling]

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.333
Oh, no.

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:22.875
When was the last time someone saw Evie?

01:09:22.958 --> 01:09:23.875
[gasps]

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.458

-Evie!
-Evie!

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:28.583
Evie!

01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:30.500
We were just playing hide-and-seek.

01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:32.708
I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry.

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:34.542
It's okay. We just need to find her.

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:36.000
She's not in the house.

01:09:36.083 --> 01:09:37.417
Oh, my gosh.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.375
Get Ms. Trapper onto the school WhatsApp.

01:09:39.458 --> 01:09:41.292
Kids, DM your friends.

01:09:41.375 --> 01:09:43.208
We need all the help we can get.

01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:45.667
[voice breaking] Find my Evie. Please.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.583
She'll turn up. I'm 100% certain.

01:09:49.083 --> 01:09:52.333
It's all my fault.
It was asking too much of Bernie.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:53.708
[sobs]

01:09:53.792 --> 01:09:54.875

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:57.875
Bernie, wait! Please.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:09:58.917
Evie!

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:01.625
-Don't worry, we'll be fine.
-We'll find her.

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:03.042
-Stick together!
-Be careful!

01:10:08.875 --> 01:10:12.708
Danny, we need you
and we need your monster-quad monstrosity.

01:10:12.792 --> 01:10:14.583
Eve McNutt is missing.

01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:33.750
-Let's go.
-Evie.

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:36.792
Evie! Come to Charlie!

01:10:36.875 --> 01:10:39.000
I've got lots of sweets!

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.417
-[shushes] Charlie.
-Come on, Charlie.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.000
Please be serious,
this is no time for naughtiness.

01:10:48.333 --> 01:10:49.500
-Good.
-She's here.

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:50.750
Don't worry.

01:10:54.375 --> 01:10:58.208
Right, spread out,
form a line, two meters apart.

01:10:58.292 --> 01:10:59.958
Mustn't miss a spot!

01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:01.708
[Mrs. McNutt] Hurry!

01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:05.250
[Ms. Trapper]
Maintain your distance and hold the line.

01:11:06.208 --> 01:11:07.667
Eve! Evie.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:11.125
Evie-Weevie. Ice cream over here!

01:11:11.208 --> 01:11:12.625
-Charlie, now is not the time.
-Charlie.

01:11:12.708 --> 01:11:13.750
Stop it.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:15.833
No, you stop it.

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:18.292
Charlie's not being naughty.
She's searching.

01:11:18.375 --> 01:11:21.208
Helping people Charlie-style,
with… with imagination.

01:11:21.292 --> 01:11:22.417
Well, I'm sure Dad just…

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.250
Why did Santa leave her a full stocking?

01:11:24.333 --> 01:11:27.542
Because he knows
that Charlie isn't naughty. She's nice.

01:11:27.625 --> 01:11:31.250
Oh, and she actually darned well
does something about it all.

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:32.708
-Does she?
-Do I?

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:36.333
Yes, you do.
And it's because she loves me so much.

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.958
Why did Charlie
step on Nisha's dress in the play?

01:11:39.042 --> 01:11:41.792
Because Nisha's mean to me
all the time and calls me the…

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:43.125
"Boring twin."

01:11:43.208 --> 01:11:46.417
Exactly. Why did Charlie
drop the snow avalanche on Mrs. Horton?

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.292
-Pardon?
-Because I love her dog, Buddy

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:50.667
and she's absolutely horrible to him.

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.250
Is that right, Charlie?

01:11:52.333 --> 01:11:54.833
Well, motivation is a complex thing.

01:11:54.917 --> 01:11:57.000
And when she let
Farmer Yirrell's turkeys out…

01:11:57.083 --> 01:11:59.625
-Charlie, you did not.
-Charlie Beccles…

01:11:59.708 --> 01:12:00.875
Yes, she did.

01:12:00.958 --> 01:12:04.167
And she did it because at Christmas
the poor, lovely turkeys have to die

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.417
because we have to eat them on a day
when there's far too much food anyhow.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:08.792
Well, yes…

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:12.542
So my ambition next year
is to be more like Charlie. Not less.

01:12:12.625 --> 01:12:14.583
Now, can we please just find little Evie

01:12:14.667 --> 01:12:18.583
and move on from this whole
negative pigeonholing extravaganza.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:19.792

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:21.417

01:12:35.333 --> 01:12:37.333
I mean, maybe?

01:12:37.417 --> 01:12:38.292
If that suits?

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:39.625
Oh. Uh…

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:41.583

01:12:44.958 --> 01:12:47.042
You're the best sister ever.

Now, just get on the bike
with Romeo, Juliet.

We'll never find her when it's this dark.

But we must keep going.

01:13:14.875 --> 01:13:16.625

[frantic panting]

01:15:01.292 --> 01:15:02.167
Pink bird.

01:15:07.625 --> 01:15:08.542
Evie!

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:16.375
[whimpering]

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.625
Oh, God.

01:15:25.625 --> 01:15:27.625
[sobbing]

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:30.917
Oh, Evie.

01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:36.375
Evie!

01:15:37.042 --> 01:15:37.958
[sobs]

01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:40.208
[Charlie] There she is.

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:41.542
Bernie!

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.125
Bernie! Are you okay?

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:46.708
[sobbing] Evie? Where is she?

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:48.292
We'll keep looking. We'll find her.

01:15:48.375 --> 01:15:50.542
-[Bernie] It's all my fault.
-[Sam] She's out there, I know.

01:15:51.292 --> 01:15:53.208
Look over there!

01:15:53.292 --> 01:15:54.125
[gasps]

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:58.458
[gasps]
Look where he's pointing the light.

01:15:58.542 --> 01:16:00.042
There's something moving.

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.958
Evie!

01:16:04.542 --> 01:16:05.958
Evie!

01:16:07.625 --> 01:16:09.375
[panting]

01:16:09.958 --> 01:16:11.125
[fox whines]

01:16:11.917 --> 01:16:13.667
-[gasps]
-[barks]

01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:17.125
[sobbing breaths]

01:16:17.208 --> 01:16:19.333
Evie!

01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:22.000
[distant gobbling]

01:16:24.042 --> 01:16:25.625
[gasps] The beach huts.

01:16:37.417 --> 01:16:38.375
[surprised gobbling]

01:16:41.208 --> 01:16:45.208
Bernie, all the big birdies! Look!

01:16:45.292 --> 01:16:47.375
[relieved gasping]

01:16:47.458 --> 01:16:48.708
[giggles]

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:51.667
Evie.

01:16:52.833 --> 01:16:54.375
[gasps] Evie.

01:16:54.458 --> 01:16:55.750
Mummy!

01:16:55.833 --> 01:16:57.625
Oh, Evie, my darling.

01:16:57.708 --> 01:16:58.958
[all chuckling]

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:02.792
We found her!
We found her at the beach huts!

01:17:02.875 --> 01:17:04.083
They found her!

01:17:04.167 --> 01:17:05.917
-She's safe.
-She's here.

01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.750
They've got her! They found her!

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:10.542
Did I win hide-and-seek?

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:12.292
-[chuckling]
-Yes, darling.

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:14.125
[voice breaking] You very much won.

01:17:14.625 --> 01:17:17.667
Come here, you life-saving
feathery superhero.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:19.250
-Oh! Ooh! Ow!
-[gobbling]

01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:21.292
Absolutely love turkeys.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:22.625
[all laugh]

01:17:25.083 --> 01:17:26.833
I'm so sorry I lost her.

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:29.125
I'm so stupid.

01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:32.042
I forgot the only thing that matters.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:34.333
No. No.

01:17:34.417 --> 01:17:37.375
The only thing that matters
is that you found her.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:40.792
And you gave the kids
an amazing Christmas, Bernadette.

01:17:42.292 --> 01:17:43.708
I'm so proud of you.

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:46.417
Eve family sandwich!

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:48.542
-[Bernadette chuckles]
-Mmm.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:50.375
Aw. Isn't that wonderful?

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:53.208
-Yes, [contented grunt] it really is.
-[laugh]

01:17:56.458 --> 01:17:58.500
-Danny Williams.
-Yes?

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:01.375
Was the lighthouse light really your idea?

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:02.500
Uh…

01:18:03.375 --> 01:18:05.250
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

01:18:05.833 --> 01:18:07.792
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:07.875 --> 01:18:11.375
this is Danny,
the best person in Wellington-on-Sea.

01:18:12.167 --> 01:18:13.958
That's your cue. Go for it.

01:18:14.625 --> 01:18:15.833
Uh…

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:17.583
Um…

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.167
Sam, I was wondering,

01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:23.417
maybe we could get together
for some…

01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.917
f-for some wine gums sometime?

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.208
Um… Wrong twin, chickpea.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:32.167
Over here. But yes, that'd be great.

01:18:34.083 --> 01:18:35.667
[all laughing]

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:40.917
-[turkey gobbles]
-[laughter fades]

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:45.000
[Santa] And that was That Christmas.

01:18:45.083 --> 01:18:48.917
One that will live long
in the memory down Wellington way

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.083
and prove that the best Christmases
aren't really about presents

01:18:53.167 --> 01:18:56.042
and that splendid fellow called Santa.

01:18:56.125 --> 01:18:59.958
They're about being with the people
you love. In the place you love.

01:19:00.042 --> 01:19:02.375
And a time for local heroes.

01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:05.875
Like the one whose caring soul
gave my friend Bill

01:19:06.458 --> 01:19:08.708
one last Christmas with his Mum.

01:19:13.167 --> 01:19:15.542
But one more wrinkle remained.

01:19:15.625 --> 01:19:19.042
The traditional crazy Boxing Day sea swim.

01:19:19.125 --> 01:19:24.125
This year, for the very first time,
obviously, no one was going to show up.

01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:29.083
Well, except for one fearless,
skinny old sea dog, of course.

01:19:29.167 --> 01:19:32.792
Even if it meant doing it on his own,
he'd never miss it.

01:19:33.708 --> 01:19:35.083
Come on, guys! Come on!

01:19:35.167 --> 01:19:36.958
-Hi, Bill.
-Hello.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:40.417
Happy Christmas, Bill.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:41.958
Are you braving it?

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:44.750
[Santa] Well, what do you know?

01:19:44.833 --> 01:19:48.833
I thought Wellington-on-Sea
was just an ordinary town

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:51.125
I'd drop in on once a year.

01:19:51.208 --> 01:19:53.083
But I was very wrong.

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:56.167
It turns out
it's a rather remarkable community.

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:00.500
Where the only gift
they ever really needed was each other.

01:20:00.583 --> 01:20:02.958
Here you go, little monster.
No more escaping, Evie.

01:20:03.042 --> 01:20:05.833
[Santa] And a real community is for life.

01:20:05.917 --> 01:20:08.000
Not just for Christmas.

01:20:08.583 --> 01:20:09.625
[Mr. Beccles] I love it.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
There you go, my love.

01:20:12.083 --> 01:20:13.583
Such a nice young man.

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:19.375
[both giggle]

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:22.875
Come on, Danny. Let's do it.

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.333
Yeah!

01:20:25.875 --> 01:20:27.083
[laughs]

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.250
-Oh, it's flipping cold.
-[laughing]

01:20:31.125 --> 01:20:32.458
Whoa!

01:20:37.292 --> 01:20:39.542
Mission accomplished.

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:41.750
[both yell]

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:44.625
-[squeals]
-It's amazing!

01:20:44.708 --> 01:20:46.417
[both laughing]

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:48.958
["Christmas Lights" by Coldplay playing]

01:20:49.042 --> 01:20:50.833
[laughs] Come on, follow me.

01:20:51.333 --> 01:20:52.917
Last one in is a loser.

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.708
-That'll be you then!
-Oof.

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:56.000
[Mrs. Forrest] Kids, wait!

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:57.542
-I'm not so sure, to be honest.
-[whoops]

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.167
-Come on, big chicken.
-Please… Ooh!

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.833
[all whooping]

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:02.875
Mummy, hold this.

01:21:03.375 --> 01:21:05.875
-Whoo!
-Happy hypothermia.

01:21:05.958 --> 01:21:07.833
[shuddering]

01:21:09.625 --> 01:21:10.458
Oh!

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:13.208
[laughs]

01:21:13.292 --> 01:21:14.958
[all chattering]

01:21:15.042 --> 01:21:19.208
Ms. Trapper,
thanks for looking out for my Danny.

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.125
Merry Christmas.

01:21:21.792 --> 01:21:24.583
Yes. It has been, hasn't it?

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:29.000
And now I believe it's time for a swim.

01:21:29.083 --> 01:21:30.792
Chocks away!

01:21:30.875 --> 01:21:33.417
I think you're right.
Let's show them how it's done!

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.000
[laughs]

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:38.542
-[whoops]
-Look at me, I'm Christmas-Eve!

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:45.583
