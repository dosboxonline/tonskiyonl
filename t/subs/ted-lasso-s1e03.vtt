WEBVTT

00:49.675 --> 00:51.301
Fuck!

00:54.429 --> 00:56.849
Siri, call Shithead.

01:02.896 --> 01:03.897
Good morning.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.859
There is nothing in The Sun
about Ted and Keeley.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.861
Nothing. Are you in your office?

01:08.944 --> 01:10.153
Of course I am.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.238
Then get up here now.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.367
Bye, boys. Tell Mum I love her.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.203
Knock, knock.
Hey, boss, I don't know about you,

01:18.287 --> 01:20.747
but I had an absolute peach of a Sunday.

01:20.831 --> 01:21.832
Here you go.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.252
Yeah, finally saw Big Ben.

01:25.335 --> 01:27.588
Boy, I thought
I'd seen the biggest clock there was.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.423
When I was a kid, my folks took me

01:29.506 --> 01:32.009
to the Allen-Bradley Clock Tower
up there in Milwaukee.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.760
They ended up leaving me there
all by myself.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.763
Yeah, three hours and 42 minutes.
You know how I know that?

01:36.847 --> 01:38.140
You were staring at a clock?

01:38.223 --> 01:40.517
I was staring at a clock.
That's exactly right. Yeah, bingo.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.810
That's a little bit of a mystery puzzle.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.395
You figured it out right away.
You're a sharp cookie.

01:43.478 --> 01:44.479
-Ted.
-Yeah.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.899
Speaking as we were mere moments ago,
about time,

01:46.982 --> 01:48.692
I unfortunately don't have any.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.569
I have a branding meeting, so...

01:51.111 --> 01:52.529
I always feel so bad for the cows,

01:52.613 --> 01:54.781
but you gotta do it
otherwise they get lost.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.120
That was a branding joke.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.496
If we were in Kansas right now,

02:01.580 --> 02:04.249
I'd just be sitting here waiting for you
to finish laughing. Yeah.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.502
I'll see ya tomorrow, okay?

02:06.585 --> 02:09.463
-Okay. Counting the minutes.
-Yeah, there you are.

02:30.901 --> 02:34.404
All right. Let's see what we got here.
I've got this fella up here, the goalie.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.657
Then all these guys over here, okay?

02:36.740 --> 02:39.409
And going over here, going over that way.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.079
This son of a gun's gonna go
all the way down here.

02:45.207 --> 02:47.626
Crystal Palace
kicked our booties last week.

02:48.252 --> 02:50.712
And this here, is our current offense
that we are running,

02:50.796 --> 02:52.881
and I think it stinks!

02:54.049 --> 02:55.342
Get rid of it.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.640
Now, you might be wondering why'd I draw
all that up there just to erase it.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.851
And that is because
I believe in symbolic gestures.

03:04.560 --> 03:05.686
As do I.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.105
What time did you get home last night?

03:08.772 --> 03:10.566
-Didn't.
-Really?

03:11.733 --> 03:14.069
Now, look, our whole offense right now
is all give-and-go.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.655
Give the ball to Jamie
and everyone else can go to hell.

03:16.738 --> 03:19.575
So, I am officially on the prowl
for any new ideas, you hear?

03:22.286 --> 03:23.620
-You got something, Nate?
-No.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.998
So...

03:26.081 --> 03:28.333
No. No. God, no. Never mind, I'm sorry.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.919
Come on now. You're one of us.
Let's go. Fire away. What do you got?

03:31.003 --> 03:33.714
Okay, right.
Well, it's just... No, other pocket.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.591
It's just something that I thought of.

03:37.426 --> 03:39.136
Sorry. Jesus.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.054
Not that one.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.265
You know what, it's not even very good.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.392
It's probably really bad.
It's embarrassing even.

03:45.475 --> 03:46.476
-I just--
-Sorry, Nate.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.396
I have a real tricky time hearing
folks that don't believe in themselves.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.731
I'm gonna ask you real quick again.

03:50.814 --> 03:52.941
-Do you think this idea will work?
-Yeah, I do.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.028
-Why you screaming at us, Nate?
-God!

03:56.111 --> 03:57.696
We're right here.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.990
All right, come on now.
Walk us through it.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.202
Okay. So, I thought if we started
the attack on the wing,

04:03.285 --> 04:04.620
Jamie could run through nearside,

04:04.703 --> 04:07.414
then when the defense follows,
Sam could fill his spot.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
So, use Jamie as a decoy?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.334
No.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.171
No. Well, yeah, in--
Yeah, in this case, yes.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.339
Let's give it a shot.

04:18.175 --> 04:19.343
What, you're gonna use my play?

04:19.426 --> 04:21.637
Yeah. I mean,
we're gonna try it on, see if it fits.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.055
You know, it might not.

04:23.138 --> 04:25.933
Then again,
it might be a very flattering silhouette,

04:26.016 --> 04:27.809
and I might wear it right outta the store.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.645
Makes me feel good and I start to strut.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.898
I'm like, "I like this.
I like the way this makes me feel."

04:32.981 --> 04:34.274
Show him your strut, Coach.

04:34.358 --> 04:37.194
Yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah.
Yep, that's how to strut.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.820
Let me see you strut, Nate. Come on.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.074
There you go, Nate.
Yeah, that's one way to do it.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.283
There you go.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.619
You look a little angry,
but that's all right.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.371
That's my fault.
I forgot the pitch is right this way.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.872
Come on, let's go.
Strut this way. Here we go.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.123
Still strutting.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.000
-I'll see you later. Yeah.
-Yeah.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.505
Ted! Hey, have you got a minute?

04:56.588 --> 04:59.675
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything okay?
-Yeah, yeah. No, it's fine, yeah.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.847
-It's not fine. Everything's shit.
-Oh, no.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.307
This was gonna be
the front page of The Sun today.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.309
"Manager Shags Star Player's Girlfriend."

05:10.060 --> 05:11.770
I think a more accurate headline would be,

05:11.854 --> 05:15.566
"Manager Innocently Feeds Young Woman
Whose Relationship Does Not Define Her."

05:15.649 --> 05:17.150
Ted, this is really bad!

05:17.234 --> 05:20.320
Except I look insanely fit
in this picture.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.073
Yeah, no, it's beautiful light.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.742
My friend who works at the paper said
he can hold this story for one day

05:25.826 --> 05:27.202
as a favor.

05:27.286 --> 05:30.539
When this shit hits,
Jamie is going to go mental.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
There's going to be photographers
all over us.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.000
Right, right.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.960
The next picture of me
will not be this perfect.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.421
I am gonna be mid-sneeze face, like--

05:40.883 --> 05:42.718
-Guess what the headline will be.
-Gesundheit?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.012
"Jamie's Tart Breaks Tartt's Heart."

05:45.762 --> 05:47.431
-Did you just come up with that?
-Yeah.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.641
-Everyone would read that.
-Of course they would.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.019
You have no idea the power of rhyming
in this goddamn country.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.145
Yeah.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.856
"Lasso Makes Passo
and Creates Team Fiasco."

05:56.773 --> 05:57.941
Keeley's got bars.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.028
Yeah, I'm cute as a button
and I can rhyme my ass off.

06:01.987 --> 06:03.906
God, it's no wonder
they want to destroy me.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.908
Yeah, yeah.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.458
Sorry, it took me so long
to get up the stairs.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.545
I was... stopped to talk
by about a hundred people.

06:18.629 --> 06:19.963
Still nothing.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.090
Get someone to run
the story about Ted and Keeley.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.678
-Hey, boss.
-Ted! And Keeley. Hello.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.014
Hey, I found that in the hall. Yeah.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.099
So, we got ourselves a situation here.

06:31.183 --> 06:32.726
Go ahead, show her the picture, yeah.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.396
See? And the fucking Sun
is running it tomorrow.

06:36.480 --> 06:37.689
Honestly, these people,

06:37.773 --> 06:40.651
they just have no regard
for people's privacy and dignity.

06:40.734 --> 06:44.321
Yeah, I'm gonna find the piece of shit
that took this and who hired them.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.906
No, no. Not necessary.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.368
I know the owner of the paper.
I can get this stopped with a phone call.

06:50.494 --> 06:52.913
Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.248
See, what I tell ya, huh?

06:54.331 --> 06:57.209
This woman right here is strong,
confident and powerful.

06:57.292 --> 07:00.212
Boss, I tell ya, I'd hate to see you
and Michelle Obama arm wrestle,

07:00.295 --> 07:02.256
but I wouldn't be able to
take my eyes off it either.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.091
That's not a compliment I've had before.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.011
-You do have perfect action figure-y arms.
-Yeah.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.139
There's another one. Anyway, glad to help.

07:11.223 --> 07:13.100
-All right. Yeah.
-Thank you.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.352
-Okay.
-See y'all later.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.064
There's no way she can
trace that photo back to me, can she?

07:19.565 --> 07:21.400
-Yes.
-What do you mean "yes"?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.194
Did you not use an alias
or a burner phone?

07:24.278 --> 07:29.575
I'm not a spy, Rebecca. I'm just
the director of football operations.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.743
And equally proficient at both.

07:31.827 --> 07:34.538
Well, thank you. Wait...

07:35.998 --> 07:38.709
Okay, here we go. Sam lays it for Dickson.

07:38.792 --> 07:39.668
Okay, nice touch.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.881
Switch to Bumbercatch.

07:44.339 --> 07:46.550
Jamie decoys through.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.760
-Sam wide open.
-There it is!

07:56.435 --> 07:58.187
Nice play, Nate. How you feel?

07:58.270 --> 08:01.523
I just don't know.
So many new feelings. Yeah.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.025
Kinda like getting your first pube, right?

08:03.108 --> 08:04.109
-Yeah. What?
-Here we go.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.945
All right. Hey. Nice work.

08:07.029 --> 08:08.030
Okay, now, gentlemen,

08:08.113 --> 08:09.615
here's the other thing
we're gonna start focusing on.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.909
Making quicker transitions
from offense to defense.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.120
Y'all gotta start making your hellos
goodbyes. You understand?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.247
Easiest way to get that done well
is to do it well.

08:17.331 --> 08:20.083
But aside from that,
you gotta be in great shape, right?

08:20.167 --> 08:23.128
So, we are all gonna run two laps
around this field.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.548
Anyone who loses to me
has to run four more. Let's go!

08:27.132 --> 08:30.052
-Okay, come on. What you got?
-What's going on?

08:34.139 --> 08:36.058
You're catching up. Don't cut that corner!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.101
Come on. You can't catch me,
I'm the gingerbread man.

08:38.184 --> 08:39.520
Faster, boys!

08:41.730 --> 08:43.565
-Look at his face.
-Colin, Isaac, please stop.

08:43.982 --> 08:45.651
Yeah, it really hurts now.
It really hurts.

08:45.734 --> 08:47.945
Be careful, Colin, now.
That's our new coach.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.696
-Oh, right, boyo.
-Yeah.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.948
Sorry, gaffer.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.075
Thank you.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.248
Okay, way to run out there today, fellas.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.208
You guys are much faster than me.

09:01.875 --> 09:02.876
Except Coach Beard.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.170
What's going on? I thought you ran track
in high school or something.

09:05.254 --> 09:06.255
Chess team, Coach.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.506
Illinois State Champs, baby.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.383
Okay, yeah. Illinois is a state, fellas.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.302
One last thing, there are some gifts
up in y'all's lockers.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.805
In your little cubbies up there.
So, hope you enjoy 'em.

09:28.569 --> 09:29.903
It's a fucking book.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.707
Nice one, bitch boy.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.257
-Hey.
-Yeah, I just thought you should know

09:50.340 --> 09:52.926
that your boy Nathan's being harassed
every single day

09:53.010 --> 09:56.013
by Jamie and his little... side-pricks.

09:56.722 --> 09:58.348
-Right.
-So you know already?

09:58.432 --> 09:59.474
Yep.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.143
So, you'll take care of it?

10:01.226 --> 10:02.311
No.

10:03.687 --> 10:04.771
What the fuck?

10:04.855 --> 10:07.816
Roy, I learned two pretty big lessons

10:07.900 --> 10:10.819
on the rough-and-tumble playgrounds
of Brookridge Elementary School.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.489
One, if little Ronnie Fowch
offers you a candy bar,

10:14.573 --> 10:17.075
you immediately say no,
and you get the hell outta there.

10:17.659 --> 10:18.911
'Cause there's a good chance

10:18.994 --> 10:22.122
that little son of a gun has just pooped
inside of a Butterfinger wrapper.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.209
No one ever saw him do it,
but a couple people ate it.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.420
Number two, if the teacher tells the bully
not to pick on someone,

10:28.504 --> 10:29.838
it's just gonna make it worse.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.381
So, you're not gonna do anything?

10:32.216 --> 10:33.342
No.

10:39.223 --> 10:40.432
Why you winding him up?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.184
He's the one, Coach.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.311
If we're gonna make an impact here,

10:44.394 --> 10:47.648
the first domino that needs to fall
is right inside that man's heart.

10:57.616 --> 10:58.617
Yes.

11:00.035 --> 11:03.747
-Jamie, can I ask you something?
-It's 40 kilos. I do three sets of ten.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.794
And then I alternate between bis and tris.

11:08.877 --> 11:11.463
I don't give a shit what you lift,
you little pretty boy.

11:11.547 --> 11:13.215
Yeah, you do, 'cause you asked.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.551
Can you curl 40 kilos?

11:15.634 --> 11:17.511
No, but I can use your balls
as a speed bag.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.721
-Do you wanna try that?
-Not especially.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.558
Do you even understand
the influence you have on this team?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.476
-I'm the shit, yeah.
-No, you're a bellend.

11:24.560 --> 11:28.063
But because your right foot
was kissed by God the boys look up to you.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.690
It's made me question my own faith.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.483
So, when they pick on Nate...

11:33.151 --> 11:34.278
and you laugh...

11:34.820 --> 11:35.821
Yeah.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.447
...they think it's okay.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.285
Right, 'cause Nate's a weak baby
and he can't do anything about it.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.750
Yeah, all right. I'll take care of it.
Nate's a good lad.

11:49.168 --> 11:50.252
Good.

11:51.670 --> 11:52.921
Hey, Roy. You comin' to the club tonight?

11:53.005 --> 11:54.214
Hold on, will you be there?

11:54.298 --> 11:56.383
-Of course, bruv.
-Then fuck no.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.511
Colin, Isaac, come here.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.848
You know how you two are
always messing with Nate?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.099
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.271
Keep it up. Makes me laugh.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.364
-Good morning, Higgins.
-Good morning. I was just--

12:19.448 --> 12:21.909
Waiting at the entrance
so I'd see you were here on time.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.244
Exactly. You seem in good spirits.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.914
Yes, I am. I've just realized something.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.916
Who cares if we can't run that picture?

12:28.999 --> 12:30.876
The bigger issue
is that the local community

12:30.959 --> 12:33.420
is getting behind the team
no matter how badly they play.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.381
It is an outstanding fan base.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.009
Yes, one I believe I can put an end to.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.093
Hooray.

12:40.886 --> 12:42.095
No.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.139
Okay. I'll go back there.

12:44.223 --> 12:46.266
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

12:46.350 --> 12:48.560
So, I spoke to the owner of The Sun.

12:48.644 --> 12:49.853
You spoke to God?

12:50.479 --> 12:51.855
-No, the newspaper.
-Oh, right.

12:51.939 --> 12:55.526
And he has agreed to
not run the photo of you and Keeley.

12:56.151 --> 13:00.155
MVP! MVP! MVP!

13:00.239 --> 13:02.407
-Left leg! Right leg, not as good!
-Okay.

13:02.491 --> 13:04.076
-Yeah!
-Yes. Okay, thank you, Ted.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.827
Sorry. Yeah, no.
You were saying. Go ahead.

13:05.911 --> 13:06.912
In exchange,

13:06.995 --> 13:10.374
I've agreed for his
more reputable newspaper, The Independent,

13:10.457 --> 13:11.959
to do a profile on you.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.335
"One-on-One with Coach Lasso."

13:13.418 --> 13:14.503
Yeah, okay.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.380
The writer will be Trent Crimm.

13:17.214 --> 13:20.217
And he's very good,
and the supporters really listen to him.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.678
Oh, no. I know Trent, yeah.
He's a tough cookie.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.972
-Really?
-Yeah, but that's okay.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.557
You know what you do
with tough cookies, don't ya?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.017
-No.
-Dip 'em in milk.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.104
All right, let's run that new one.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.818
Hey, there he is.

13:37.901 --> 13:39.862
Hello, Coach Ted Lasso from America.

13:39.945 --> 13:42.281
Hello, Trent Crimm from The Independent.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.324
Hey, excited to spend the day with ya.
Gonna be fun.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.784
And please, call me Ted.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.036
All right, let's go!

13:53.876 --> 13:54.960
Wide open.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.628
-Yeah!
-Snuck it by him.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.970
Thataway, Sammy. How'd that feel?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.681
Oh, wonderful, Coach.
I felt that one in my penis.

14:07.764 --> 14:09.641
Yeah. No, that sounds about right.
That's good. Yeah.

14:09.725 --> 14:12.227
Hey, Jamie, you gotta sell
that run-through hard, baby.

14:12.311 --> 14:13.979
Make the defense believe you.
Watch, like this.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.606
Ball! Ball! Give me the ball!

14:15.689 --> 14:18.525
I want the ball! Give me the ball!
I would like the ball, please!

14:18.609 --> 14:19.610
Make it a performance.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.945
I want you winning an Oscar
at the ESPYs next year.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.363
You want me to run decoy?

14:23.447 --> 14:24.406
Yeah, that's right.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.449
It's a joke.

14:25.949 --> 14:28.452
Unfortunately for you, though,
no one thinks it's funny.

14:28.535 --> 14:29.536
That true?

14:29.912 --> 14:32.164
Agree to disagree. I find it hilarious.

14:32.247 --> 14:33.540
I thought it was
funnier than Step Brothers.

14:33.624 --> 14:34.499
High praise.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.793
That scene where the bunk bed collapses...

14:37.211 --> 14:39.463
I used to think
that was the funniest thing I'd ever seen,

14:39.546 --> 14:40.547
but then I just saw that.

14:40.631 --> 14:42.633
And now I'm gonna have to
rethink my order of what I think is

14:42.716 --> 14:43.842
the funniest thing I've ever seen.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.221
Yeah, that's when sports and art combine,
as far as I'm concerned.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.097
All right, fellas,
let's run it again. Let's go.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.182
Cheers.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.185
Yeah, they're getting it.
They're getting it.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.395
Interesting play, Ted.
Did you come up with this?

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
Oh, no, no, no.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.732
This is all cooked up
by our very own Nate the Great.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.484
Who's "Nate the Great"?

15:01.443 --> 15:02.444
Oh, yeah. There he is.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.781
Someone's been walking their dog here.
Found another poo.

15:06.323 --> 15:07.324
Okay.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.993
What exactly does "Nate the Great" do?

15:10.494 --> 15:11.912
I'm not exactly sure what his title is.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.580
Hey, Coach.
What is Nate's job around here?

15:13.664 --> 15:15.415
-Kit man.
-There you go. Kit man.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.461
Do you mean to tell me you're
entrusting a Premier League team's attack

15:19.545 --> 15:20.504
to the kit man?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.131
That young fellow's forgotten more
about this sport than I'll ever know.

15:23.215 --> 15:25.342
Heck, might be a genius.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.677
Anything to add, Coach?

15:26.760 --> 15:27.761
Good kid.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.347
Boy, oh boy.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.224
If you knew Coach Beard,
you'd know what a big deal that was.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.433
You mean that, don't you?

15:35.060 --> 15:36.562
Well, hell.
There's your story right there.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.648
Got a headline and everything.
"Man Nods Head."

15:39.731 --> 15:40.858
Watch your back, Gay Talese.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.987
There's a new iconic profile
about to be typed up by one Trent Crimm.

15:45.070 --> 15:46.446
Tighten up those lines!

15:47.281 --> 15:48.365
Let 'em know, Coach.

15:50.784 --> 15:51.785
Come on.

15:52.995 --> 15:53.996
Get a towel.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.998
-Oh, God. No, no, no.
-Get a towel.

15:56.081 --> 15:59.042
-Let go. Please, God. Stop it. No.
-Oi, oi!

15:59.126 --> 16:00.627
What the fuck are you doing?

16:01.420 --> 16:03.046
Jamie not talk to you
about leaving him alone?

16:07.176 --> 16:08.844
Fuck's sake.

16:17.978 --> 16:20.105
-You look like you've forgotten something.
-Hi, Keeley.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.941
I'm looking for your prick boyfriend.
You know how to pick 'em, don't ya?

16:23.025 --> 16:26.820
Didn't your last girlfriend steal
your Rolex and sell it for drug money?

16:26.904 --> 16:29.489
So? I don't need a phone and a watch.

16:30.282 --> 16:32.868
Look, I didn't sign up
to be your boyfriend's minder, okay?

16:32.951 --> 16:35.787
But the new gaffer's
trying to make me feel responsible

16:35.871 --> 16:39.374
for fucking Nate,
whose last name I don't even know.

16:39.458 --> 16:40.626
It's Barnes.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.752
No. It's Shelley.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.836
Yeah, I know.

16:42.920 --> 16:44.213
I don't like being tricked.

16:44.296 --> 16:48.133
Not by you and not by,
"Howdy y'all, cowboys.

16:48.217 --> 16:51.136
My name is Ted Lasso and I'm from Kansas."

16:53.514 --> 16:56.183
Wow, you're, like,
really, really bad at impressions, man.

16:56.266 --> 17:01.230
I know he's trying to push my buttons,
but I cannot be manipulated.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.316
Come on. I could push all of your buttons
right now if I wanted to.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.276
-No, you couldn't, Keeley--
-I think, actually, I could.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.529
-You couldn't, Keeley-- No, Keeley.
-What was that? I can't seem to hear you.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.739
-Keeley, if you would listen to me--
-I'm trying to listen to you.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.074
-I could tell you why--
-So tell me.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.701
Is that making you mad?

17:15.618 --> 17:16.619
No.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.579
No.

17:21.708 --> 17:26.088
"I'm Roy Kent
and I get paid to play a game,

17:26.171 --> 17:28.423
but I'm mad all the time."

17:34.179 --> 17:35.430
That's actually pretty good.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.065
Hey, Trent.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.401
-You know who you remind me of right now?
-No. Who?

17:47.484 --> 17:48.986
One of them robot vacuums.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.822
Just kinda wandering around
looking for dirt.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.574
-Roomba.
-That's the one.

17:54.283 --> 17:55.826
Actually, I have a question.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.870
After your resounding loss
to Crystal Palace,

17:57.953 --> 18:00.706
one of your players said
there was a party in the locker room.

18:00.789 --> 18:03.834
Do you feel it sends the right message
having a party after a loss?

18:04.960 --> 18:08.380
Well, Trent, I've never really concerned
myself too much with wins and losses.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.507
Now that's a quote I'll probably use.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.592
You should get going.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.886
Hey, will you let Roy know
we're heading out soon?

18:13.969 --> 18:15.220
-Copy.
-Thanks, Coach.

18:15.304 --> 18:18.473
You wanna tag along?
We're gonna go speak to some schoolkids.

18:18.557 --> 18:20.058
Oh, what a coincidence.

18:20.142 --> 18:23.270
The day of our interview you just happen
to be visiting a local school.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.731
Well, that's the funny thing
about coincidences, ain't it?

18:26.523 --> 18:27.816
Sometimes they just happen.

18:28.734 --> 18:29.902
Come on now.

18:31.737 --> 18:32.571
Come in.

18:32.654 --> 18:35.991
I just wanted to come and thank you again
for stopping that picture from running.

18:36.575 --> 18:37.826
And I bought you a present.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.415
Made me think of you.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.918
It's strong and a bit prickly.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.089
You know, I've decided to
not be scared of you anymore.

18:51.715 --> 18:52.841
I didn't know you were.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.885
Yeah.
I was, like, fucking terrified of you.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.679
My God,
Jamie would have been so pissed off

18:57.763 --> 19:00.057
with reporters poking around
in our love life.

19:01.099 --> 19:03.477
I don't know why I'm telling you.
You know all about that, don't you?

19:03.560 --> 19:05.062
Remember when you got divorced?

19:05.562 --> 19:06.688
It rings a bell.

19:06.772 --> 19:08.690
Yeah, I mean, didn't it,
like, make you really mad

19:08.774 --> 19:10.442
that they went after you and not Rupert?

19:10.526 --> 19:13.153
'Cause he was the one that cheated
and he came across like Prince Charming.

19:13.237 --> 19:15.531
It really pissed me off.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.909
Well, the press are never awful to men.

19:19.451 --> 19:22.621
No one ever pays a fortune for a photo
of a naked man on a yacht in Mallorca

19:22.704 --> 19:23.914
a week after his divorce.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.250
That's like a very specific scenario.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.961
Oh, my God. That means
there's a picture of you naked on a yacht.

19:29.044 --> 19:30.003
Can I see it? Is it here?

19:30.087 --> 19:33.340
Come on. You wouldn't have said something
if you weren't dying to show someone.

19:33.882 --> 19:34.883
Please.

19:37.010 --> 19:40.389
It was taken from a helicopter
while I was sunbathing.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.142
Holy shit, Rebecca.

19:44.685 --> 19:46.061
Are those your real tits?

19:46.144 --> 19:48.522
I feel like a teenage boy.
I can't stop staring at them.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.357
Where did you get those?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.525
My mum.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.360
I can't believe
you stopped this from running.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.736
I would have shown everyone.

19:54.820 --> 19:57.656
Right. I really need to get on.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.783
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.243
Thank you.

20:04.913 --> 20:05.956
Bye.

20:06.707 --> 20:07.708
Shoes.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.252
Shoes. Yes.

20:11.712 --> 20:13.213
Wow, you really blew my brains out

20:13.297 --> 20:15.257
with those beautiful breasts of yours,
Rebecca.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.858
When I first saw
our school football squad,

20:33.609 --> 20:36.820
I didn't think that Richmond Primary
would win a single game,

20:37.404 --> 20:39.781
much less the league championship.

20:48.665 --> 20:53.212
To celebrate, please welcome
the new manager of AFC Richmond,

20:53.295 --> 20:54.796
Ed Lasso.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.800
Thank you. I appreciate you.

20:58.884 --> 21:01.220
All right. Hey, gang. How y'all doing?

21:02.179 --> 21:04.014
-Wanker.
-Jacob.

21:05.766 --> 21:06.850
It's all right.

21:07.476 --> 21:08.810
Look, I just wanted to come down

21:08.894 --> 21:11.021
and congratulate y'all
on a heck of a season.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.274
But hey, I know someone else
who's really excited to meet all of ya.

21:14.358 --> 21:15.943
So if you please help me welcome

21:16.026 --> 21:19.863
the captain of your AFC Richmond squad,
Roy Kent.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.244
Roy! Roy! Roy! Roy!

21:25.786 --> 21:26.787
Right.

21:27.496 --> 21:32.084
Never been much for public speaking
or school, really.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.586
Always seemed like a waste of time to me.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.260
Why don't we
get out of this stuffy auditorium,

21:41.343 --> 21:43.470
go out on the pitch
and have a proper fuck-about?

21:56.066 --> 21:57.818
I think it's really cool you do this.

21:57.901 --> 21:59.945
Only doing it
'cause my fucking niece goes here.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.614
-Oh, yeah? Which one is she?
-That idiot.

22:06.285 --> 22:07.536
Oh boy, here she comes.

22:08.287 --> 22:09.621
Can we do headers, Uncle Roy?

22:09.705 --> 22:10.998
Yeah, all right. Come on then.

22:12.124 --> 22:13.792
All right. Come on, you lot. Line up.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.752
Heads. Lovely.

22:15.836 --> 22:17.546
Next. Go. Perfect.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.173
Next. Heads.

22:19.840 --> 22:20.841
Next.

22:23.385 --> 22:24.803
Well done. Next.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.559
Next. Sweet.

22:30.976 --> 22:32.060
Lovely. I liked it.

22:33.937 --> 22:35.189
-Good.
-Roy, come on.

22:35.272 --> 22:37.065
You hop in there, show 'em how it's done.
I'll do a couple.

22:37.149 --> 22:38.442
How you doing? Ready? Come on.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.027
That's the spot. Come on.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.237
Here we go, Phoebe.
Let's see what you got.

22:42.321 --> 22:44.281
Hey, nice catch.
We might have ourselves a goalie.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.284
Boy, oh boy. That was right in the button.

22:48.785 --> 22:49.620
Good job, Phoebe.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.418
Oh boy.

22:56.502 --> 22:57.920
Sorry about the blood there.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.422
There you go.

23:00.506 --> 23:01.757
Don't use it to clone me.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.051
Nice meeting you. Take care now.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.763
That's the longest anyone's ever stayed
for something like this.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.598
-Hey, thanks for having us.
-Cheers.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.682
Thanks again.

23:12.017 --> 23:13.185
Roy, that was a blast.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.729
And I tell you what, that niece of yours
is a real cutie patootie.

23:15.812 --> 23:19.900
Enough. I've had it with your mind games
and your stupid gifts.

23:19.983 --> 23:22.402
I mean, what even is A Wrinkle in Time?

23:22.486 --> 23:24.112
It's a lovely novel.

23:24.196 --> 23:27.241
It's the story of a young girl's struggle
with the burden of leadership

23:27.324 --> 23:28.659
as she journeys through space.

23:29.618 --> 23:30.619
Yeah. That's it.

23:32.204 --> 23:33.789
Am I supposed to be the little girl?

23:34.331 --> 23:35.415
I'd like you to be.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.168
Right. None of this matters.

23:38.252 --> 23:40.379
'Cause I'm just doing
what everyone in this town is doing,

23:40.462 --> 23:42.381
and I'm counting down the days
until you're gone.

23:42.464 --> 23:44.466
Trent, you're a colossal prick.
You always have been.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.511
Phoebe, come on.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.601
Are you hungry?

23:56.019 --> 23:57.020
Little tradition.

23:59.481 --> 24:01.066
Let battle commence.

24:01.525 --> 24:02.734
Ted Lasso?

24:02.818 --> 24:05.195
-Hey there, Ollie.
-Leave it out. What are you doing here?

24:05.279 --> 24:06.738
Well, I mean, you invited me, remember?

24:06.822 --> 24:08.824
I invite every person
who's been in my car.

24:08.907 --> 24:11.368
Hey, Ollie. This is my friend Trent.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.495
-Trent, this is my buddy Ollie.
-Pleased to meet you.

24:13.579 --> 24:15.789
Congrats. You both just met a cool person.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.041
Right, gentlemen.
You know what you're having?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.502
Yeah. Well, you know,
whatever the chef recommends.

24:20.586 --> 24:24.047
That would be my father-in-law.
Are you okay with a little bit of spice?

24:24.131 --> 24:26.466
Have him make it for us
like we're a couple members of the family.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.135
You're a brave man.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.015
Oh, man. Mad respect.

24:33.098 --> 24:35.267
That might not be the wisest of choices.

24:36.727 --> 24:37.978
Here you go, boys.

24:38.896 --> 24:40.147
-Dig in.
-Can't wait.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.316
The smell's already deep inside my brain.

24:42.399 --> 24:44.943
-Gonna love it.
-I appreciate it.

24:45.027 --> 24:47.738
I can't imagine
they have good Indian food in Kansas.

24:47.821 --> 24:50.365
I have no idea.
I've never had Indian food.

25:02.127 --> 25:03.712
Wow, that-- I mean, that's hot.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.840
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
Feel like I'm about to breathe fire.

25:08.842 --> 25:09.927
I don't think I can eat that.

25:10.802 --> 25:13.013
What? No, no, no. Come on now.
We gotta put a decent dent in this,

25:13.096 --> 25:15.390
otherwise we're gonna embarrass Ollie
in front of his family.

25:15.933 --> 25:19.061
-No, really, I can't.
-Come on, just dump it on my plate.

25:21.021 --> 25:22.648
Yeah, yeah. You're good.

25:22.731 --> 25:25.317
So, if you love Kansas so much,
why did you--

25:26.109 --> 25:30.197
Why did you leave to coach a sport
you can barely-- you know anything about?

25:30.280 --> 25:31.281
Was it just the money?

25:31.865 --> 25:33.575
Wait, I'm supposed to be getting paid?

25:33.659 --> 25:34.826
Are you enjoying the food?

25:35.285 --> 25:37.120
Tell your father-in-law it's perfect.

25:37.663 --> 25:39.081
Dad! He says it's perfect!

25:41.041 --> 25:43.794
Ted. What you're doing is irresponsible.

25:44.253 --> 25:46.255
This club actually means something
to this town.

25:46.839 --> 25:47.881
I know that.

25:47.965 --> 25:48.966
I do.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.134
Trent, what do you love?

25:53.220 --> 25:54.221
Is it writing?

25:55.389 --> 25:56.223
-Yes.
-Yeah.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.808
Well, good, 'cause you're darn good at it.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.434
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:59.518 --> 26:01.436
Me? I love coaching.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.146
Now, I'm gonna say this again

26:03.230 --> 26:05.774
just so you didn't think
it was a mistake the first time I said it.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.026
For me,
success is not about the wins and losses.

26:08.610 --> 26:11.280
It's about helping these young fellas
be the best versions of themselves

26:11.363 --> 26:12.364
on and off the field.

26:12.865 --> 26:14.283
And it ain't always easy, Trent,

26:14.366 --> 26:18.036
but neither is growing up
without someone believing in you.

26:19.705 --> 26:20.831
Let me ask you this.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.542
Is my tongue still in my mouth?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.044
'Cause I am about to hallucinate
from all the heat here.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.048
I really should go.

26:31.175 --> 26:33.552
-Deadlines and all.
-Hey, gotta do the work.

26:33.635 --> 26:34.887
Hey, I'll say this though.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.139
I really enjoyed getting to
spend this time with you, Trent.

26:38.265 --> 26:39.474
You actually mean that, don't you?

26:39.892 --> 26:40.893
Yeah.

26:41.894 --> 26:42.811
Yeah.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.564
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

26:46.106 --> 26:46.940
You all right?

26:48.025 --> 26:50.027
Normally, one dish is plenty,

26:50.110 --> 26:52.779
but we know how
you Americans like to eat, innit?

26:53.405 --> 26:54.406
Let's do it, huh?

26:55.449 --> 26:56.575
Try that one.

27:03.373 --> 27:06.126
-Beautiful, right?
-It's beyond beautiful. It's hot.

27:08.837 --> 27:10.881
"Mrs. Which's voice was grave.

27:11.673 --> 27:13.175
'What do you understand?'

27:14.051 --> 27:15.469
'That it has to be me.

27:16.303 --> 27:17.763
Can't be anyone else.'"

27:22.267 --> 27:23.352
Fuck!

27:24.144 --> 27:26.146
That's a bad word, Uncle Roy.

27:26.230 --> 27:27.898
Mind your own business, Phoebe.

27:32.277 --> 27:33.278
Be good.

27:40.786 --> 27:43.997
-Yes?
-I have an advance copy of the article.

27:45.582 --> 27:48.627
-Read it to me.
-Title: "Wayward Ted."

27:49.336 --> 27:52.422
"Whatever you think of Ted Lasso
as a football coach,

27:52.506 --> 27:56.218
I assure you,
the truth is harder to swallow."

27:56.301 --> 27:59.012
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good. How's your nose, Coach?

27:59.096 --> 28:01.265
-It's fine. Thank you for asking.
-"And swallow you must,

28:01.348 --> 28:04.059
because Ted is out there in the community

28:04.142 --> 28:07.855
either bravely
or stupidly facing the music."

28:07.938 --> 28:10.023
-Hey, fellas. How you doing?
-"That's for you to decide."

28:10.107 --> 28:11.859
Piss off, wanker!

28:13.819 --> 28:15.404
-Hi.
-Yeah.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.030
-Stop it.
-Every time.

28:17.114 --> 28:19.408
"And yes, he's in over his head.

28:19.491 --> 28:23.704
He insisted twice that he didn't care
if Richmond won or lost.

28:23.787 --> 28:28.250
But if the Lasso way is wrong,
it's hard to imagine being right."

28:30.794 --> 28:32.129
Why have you stopped reading?

28:33.297 --> 28:37.176
Please do me the favor of remembering that
these aren't my words, it's Trent Crimm.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.052
Keep going.

28:40.262 --> 28:42.514
-"In a business that celebrates ego,
-...celebrates ego,

28:42.598 --> 28:43.974
-Ted reins his in."
-Ted reins his in.

28:44.057 --> 28:48.478
His coaching style is subtle.
It never hits you over the head.

28:48.562 --> 28:51.607
Hello, Roy.
I didn't know it was a retirement party.

28:53.817 --> 28:54.818
Shit!

28:55.319 --> 28:56.570
Stop messing with Nate!

28:57.321 --> 28:58.780
Now, I don't know
which one of you I nutted,

28:58.864 --> 29:00.240
'cause I don't
see so well at night anymore,

29:00.324 --> 29:01.366
but that goes for all of you!

29:02.159 --> 29:05.996
Slowly growing until you can no longer
ignore its presence.

29:06.914 --> 29:08.081
Vanilla vodka.

29:09.291 --> 29:10.292
Such a child.

29:12.669 --> 29:13.795
Keeley.

29:13.879 --> 29:14.880
Roy.

29:15.506 --> 29:18.342
Whether that means
allowing followers to become leaders,

29:20.093 --> 29:23.305
or in a show of respect,
eating food so spicy

29:23.388 --> 29:26.558
it's sure to wreak massive havoc
on his intestinal system.

29:26.642 --> 29:27.935
Keys, keys, keys.

29:28.018 --> 29:30.020
Okay, here we go. Oh boy. Oh boy.

29:30.103 --> 29:32.773
And though I believe that
Ted Lasso will fail here

29:32.856 --> 29:35.901
and Richmond will suffer
the embarrassment of relegation,

29:37.027 --> 29:38.862
I won't gloat when it happens.

29:40.030 --> 29:42.074
Because I can't help but root for him.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.327
Fuck!
