06:13.230 --> 06:18.020
<i>This informant, paid by police,</i>
<i>using taxpayers' dollars...</i>

06:18.020 --> 06:20.730
to continue his felony
drug habit, was the link...

06:20.730 --> 06:23.740
that allowed the police
to raid a private farm...

06:23.740 --> 06:27.990
a working farm where honest
Americans make their living.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.870
The government, in its haste,
has hired an army of criminals...

06:31.870 --> 06:34.540
whose allegiance to the truth
is at best questionable.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.510
Mr. Rodman...

06:37.040 --> 06:40.380
it's a shame that your client
didn't use as much sense...

06:40.380 --> 06:42.710
in choosing what he planted...

06:42.710 --> 06:45.220
as he did
in choosing his attorney...

06:45.220 --> 06:49.220
but, lately, the only variation
that l'm hearing in your argument...

06:49.220 --> 06:51.640
is the name of your client.

06:51.640 --> 06:55.430
You can stand here all day and argue
the ins and outs of Illinois v. Gates...

06:55.440 --> 06:57.520
but you're not
gonna convince me...

06:57.520 --> 07:02.070
that our government has not sanctioned
the use of anonymous informants.

07:02.070 --> 07:06.700
Furthermore, there is no sacred protection
of property rights in our country.

07:06.700 --> 07:11.500
You grow marijuana on your farm,
be it an ounce or an acre of plants...

07:11.660 --> 07:14.120
that farm can be seized...

07:14.120 --> 07:16.410
and that farm can be sold.

07:19.290 --> 07:21.650
What the hell is that?

07:22.340 --> 07:25.590
You can tell a Iot about somebody
from this stuff.

07:25.590 --> 07:28.680
lt's from your friends
at Warren, Putnam and Hudson.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.600
- A fishing rod.
- What do you think they want?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.640
Depends what state they're from.

07:33.640 --> 07:36.640
Arizona.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.660
Arizona.

07:39.600 --> 07:41.690
Medicinal marijuana initiative.

07:41.690 --> 07:44.000
Or am l being cynical?

07:44.400 --> 07:47.320
Mark... l'm gonna miss you.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.930
Thank you for aIl your hard work.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.980
Hi. How are you today?

07:59.980 --> 08:03.200
You've got a daughter. Why is it important
to get a handle on this drug problem?

08:03.200 --> 08:05.670
Because it's an issue
that affects all families.

08:05.670 --> 08:10.210
- But l'm planning on being back here as much as l can.
- How do you feel about -

08:37.010 --> 08:40.039
Okay, Gordon, no telltales:
no scratching your nose...

08:40.039 --> 08:42.309
no clearing your throat,
no crossing your legs.

08:42.309 --> 08:44.310
- I got it.
- You got it, babe.

08:44.310 --> 08:47.340
l'm cooI, man.
You just don't teIl any jokes.

08:47.340 --> 08:50.550
- "Don't teIl any jokes"?
- Don't tell jokes. It's a giveaway, Ray.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.390
- lt's not a giveaway.
- Every time you tell a joke, it's a giveaway.

08:53.390 --> 08:56.390
- Don't tell any jokes.
- You know what the problem is? You are too uptight, man.

08:56.390 --> 08:58.990
Why don't you loosen up,
take a deep breath?

08:58.990 --> 09:01.060
Breathe in slowly.
A little stretching maybe.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.260
- Come on, man. They're looking at us.
- Come on, man.

09:03.260 --> 09:06.110
We're gonna get these motherfuckers.
We know our shit.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.900
Can l get it?
Can l get it?

09:08.900 --> 09:11.800
- Baby, can l say it?
- Say it. lt's show time.

09:16.650 --> 09:20.200
<i>We're looking for Mr. Eduardo Ruiz.</i>
<i>We have a 2:00 appointment.</i>

09:20.200 --> 09:22.910
<i>He's right down the hallway</i>
<i>in the back room.</i>

09:22.920 --> 09:25.180
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:30.970 --> 09:34.000
<i>Come in. Fellas.</i>

09:34.000 --> 09:37.400
Come on, you guys.
Get him talking. Get him outside.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.680
<i>How you doing?</i>

09:39.680 --> 09:43.130
<i>- I'm well. How are you?</i>
<i>- I'm good. Pretty good.</i>

09:44.770 --> 09:47.770
Look, what's up, Ed?
We gonna move some white or what?

09:47.770 --> 09:50.570
You guys ever bought
a quarter ton before?

09:50.570 --> 09:52.820
- No?
- l don't think so.

09:52.820 --> 09:55.690
lt's a big fucking deal, all right?

09:55.690 --> 09:58.830
lt's not like you can stick it
in a condom up some mule's asshole.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.980
How many peasants is that gonna take?
You'd have a line from here to Mexico City.

10:01.980 --> 10:06.480
You say show up at a time, we show up
at the time and we're fucking sitting here.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.590
- Sure l can't offer you something to drink?
- l can offer you a joke.

10:10.590 --> 10:13.850
You want to hear a joke?
l got a joke, l got a joke. Come on, bro.

10:13.850 --> 10:16.680
lt's just a joke. Let me tell one joke.
l'm gonna tell you a joke.

10:16.690 --> 10:20.760
All right, why are hurricanes
named after women?

10:20.770 --> 10:24.140
- I don't know.
- Because when they arrive, they're wet and wild.

10:24.140 --> 10:27.020
When they leave,
they take your house and your car.

10:28.610 --> 10:31.360
- lt's true.
- You didn't find that funny?

10:31.360 --> 10:33.360
I chuckled. Damn.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.900
- FelIas... that's us.
- Yo.

10:41.200 --> 10:46.000
Okay, that's the van. Don't make
your move untiI they get Ruiz outside.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.000
l told you there was
nothing to worry about.

10:56.880 --> 10:58.260
l got another joke.

10:58.260 --> 11:00.850
- Come on, man. Please.
- Just one more. Relax.

11:00.850 --> 11:03.350
A guy goes, gets a tattoo
put on his penis.

11:03.350 --> 11:06.060
One side says yes,
the other side says no.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.350
- Tattooed on his penis?
- Yeah. The words "yes" and "no."

11:08.350 --> 11:13.150
So, his wife says, "HoId it. You tell me
how to cook, how to clean the house -"

11:13.780 --> 11:16.650
- Who the fuck is that?
- That's local.

11:16.650 --> 11:19.570
What the fuck is going -

11:19.570 --> 11:21.910
Shit! Agent down!

11:21.910 --> 11:23.780
Get in there now! Go!

11:36.510 --> 11:40.140
D.E.A.!

11:48.640 --> 11:50.940
The vest caught it.
Go ahead.

11:50.940 --> 11:53.980
Go. Shit.

12:29.770 --> 12:32.920
Shit! Fuck!

12:40.030 --> 12:43.180
Shit. Motherfucker.

13:35.580 --> 13:39.870
- l think we lost him, Ray.
- Yeah, l think so too.

13:41.470 --> 13:45.010
Don't fucking move! Get your hands - Move!

13:45.010 --> 13:47.420
Get out, you son of a bitch!
Get out!

13:48.970 --> 13:51.640
<i>Is this what</i>
<i>they wear to go to sIeep...</i>

13:51.640 --> 13:54.640
<i>or do they hang out like this</i>
<i>the whole time?</i>

13:54.650 --> 13:58.900
- That would be their sleep attire.
- lt's Iike a smoking jacket.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.400
Ηe's gonna be smoking in a minute.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.400
Okay, who's the father of Greek tragedy?
Anyone? Anyone?

14:04.410 --> 14:07.070
Okay, Aeschylus it is.
Ηis trilogy? The Oresteia.

14:07.070 --> 14:11.870
This is fucking beautiful. Can anyone -
l mean, can anyone stop the Seth machine?

14:13.040 --> 14:15.670
- No.
- That's correct. Score.

14:18.540 --> 14:21.210
And "tragedy" is closed out.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.180
But wait.

14:26.180 --> 14:29.300
- ls he her husband?
- Yes.

14:29.310 --> 14:34.110
So...
you want to try something?

14:35.350 --> 14:36.730
Yeah.

14:45.400 --> 14:49.440
- What are you doing?
- Just watch.

15:03.840 --> 15:08.260
What you're going to do is
inhale the smoke and hold it.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.390
What is this, like freebase?

15:10.390 --> 15:13.930
Not "Iike." lt is.

15:16.810 --> 15:19.810
Okay, go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.390
Hold it. Hold it.

15:28.990 --> 15:31.300
See?

15:33.910 --> 15:36.170
Now you see.

16:08.820 --> 16:12.490
How - They're doing great.

16:12.490 --> 16:15.330
Look at how cute they are.

16:15.330 --> 16:18.830
- Helena, he's doing so good.
- Little Tiger.

16:18.830 --> 16:21.880
Little Tiger, l hope.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.630
We'll be very happy if he
becomes the next Tiger Woods.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.590
So will his bank balance.

16:26.590 --> 16:29.670
- My God. Duck?
- Duck. Thank you very much.

16:29.680 --> 16:32.010
- Helena, you never order duck.
- l know, I know.

16:32.010 --> 16:35.760
lt's not me who ordered it.
lt's somebody else.

16:35.760 --> 16:38.520
Well, he or she
has very good taste.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.890
- l love duck, don't you?
- lt's delicious. Do you want some, Nan?

16:40.900 --> 16:45.060
- Yes. Thank you.
- lt's such a fatty bird.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.730
There's good cholesteroI, and there's bad
cholesterol, which is confusing to me.

16:47.740 --> 16:51.530
- That's so good.
- You know what they say about red wine.

16:51.530 --> 16:53.740
lt's good for you.
There's cholesterol in my wine.

16:53.740 --> 16:56.700
- You're allowed to have your red wine.
- The French do, don't they?

16:56.700 --> 16:58.700
l'm European.
l say that to my doctor.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.870
"l'm European.
l'm allowed to drink red wine."

17:01.870 --> 17:04.210
My doctor said it was fine
when l was pregnant.

17:04.210 --> 17:07.380
- A glass a week.
- After my amnio...

17:07.380 --> 17:09.710
he said, "Okay, now you can go
and have a glass of red wine."

17:09.720 --> 17:13.599
l had two.

17:16.560 --> 17:19.349
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

17:19.349 --> 17:21.390
- Thanks a lot.
- Can l bring the bag in the back with me?

17:21.390 --> 17:24.270
- No, sweetheart.
- How about just my putter?

17:24.270 --> 17:26.560
- Give me the putter.
- All right.

17:26.569 --> 17:29.730
ln you get. Come on.
We've got to go.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.570
Put this down here, okay?

17:32.570 --> 17:35.160
That's where Tiger Woods keeps it.
Thank you.

17:35.160 --> 17:38.410
- You're welcome.
- Okay.

17:38.410 --> 17:43.210
David, you're gonna have to promise me,
no swinging the club in the car.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.250
Okay.

17:46.250 --> 17:51.050
<i>Until you officially take over</i>
<i>the Office of National Drug ControI Policy...</i>

17:51.090 --> 17:54.130
<i>under no circumstances will you speak</i>
<i>to the press unprotected...</i>

17:54.130 --> 17:56.140
<i>without going through this office...</i>

17:56.140 --> 17:58.600
or having someone in the room.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.930
There are a lot of interests
in this town.

18:00.930 --> 18:02.890
Right now, they're scared of you.

18:02.890 --> 18:04.560
The reason they're scared of you:

18:04.560 --> 18:07.690
Technically, you have veto powers
over their budgets, so think about that.

18:07.690 --> 18:10.270
You'll also be meeting
senators and congressmen...

18:10.280 --> 18:12.610
each with a specially
prepared question.

18:12.610 --> 18:16.280
They're questions designed for one thing -
to make them look smart.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.660
lf you lecture them,
they won't think you respect them.

18:18.660 --> 18:21.200
lf you treat them
with utter humiIity, they will.

18:21.200 --> 18:24.790
This is about your respect for them
and the president's respect for them.

18:24.790 --> 18:27.790
Speaking of which, when he
gets back from Russia and China...

18:27.790 --> 18:31.250
we'll get you two together for
some face time, let you two catch up.

18:31.260 --> 18:35.340
Also, one month from today, you will
give your first official press conference.

18:35.340 --> 18:40.140
ln it, you will outline the president's
strategy for winning the war on drugs.

18:40.310 --> 18:43.350
<i>Judge, I just want</i>
<i>to be cIear about one thing:</i>

18:43.350 --> 18:45.600
<i>l am not a partisan person,</i>
<i>l am an issue person.</i>

18:45.600 --> 18:48.310
Over the course of the next few weeks,
if you allow me...

18:48.310 --> 18:50.980
l will bring you up to speed
on an incredible array of issues...

18:50.980 --> 18:54.360
the most important of which,
in my opinion, Mexico.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.660
l know everyone that you're going to meet.
l know what they want and why.

18:57.660 --> 18:59.990
lt is important
that they Iike you.

18:59.990 --> 19:02.330
lt is not important
that they like me.

19:02.330 --> 19:05.000
That is why l can help protect you.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.830
Like you protected Landry?

19:07.830 --> 19:10.170
I see where you're going with that.

19:10.170 --> 19:14.340
lf l could say one thing:
Basically, a guy like Landry is so autocratic...

19:14.340 --> 19:16.920
he doesn't even know how
to let himself be helped.

19:16.930 --> 19:21.510
<i>There's a political component to this job</i>
<i>that the general didn't have any patience for.</i>

19:21.510 --> 19:24.680
General, Bob Wakefield.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.890
- Judge, nice to meet you. Thank you.
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.

19:27.900 --> 19:32.360
Jeff, you want to excuse us for a minute?

19:32.360 --> 19:35.310
Yes, sir.
l'll be right outside.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.990
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

19:37.990 --> 19:39.570
You've done a fine job, General.

19:39.570 --> 19:42.200
The Office of National
Drug Control Policy...

19:42.200 --> 19:45.200
is in better shape
than when you found it.

19:45.580 --> 19:48.040
l'm not sure l made
the slightest difference.

19:48.040 --> 19:51.540
l tried. l really did.

19:51.540 --> 19:54.500
l think there are some positive signs.
The work's just started.

19:54.510 --> 19:56.920
l plan on seeing it through.
You can count on that.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.380
You're here for two years,
three maximum.

20:00.390 --> 20:03.930
What'd they offer you,
a court appointment?

20:03.930 --> 20:07.390
District? Appeals?
Not Supreme.

20:07.390 --> 20:11.690
This is a tough enough job.
l plan on focusing on this.

20:13.730 --> 20:17.440
You know, when Khrushchev
was forced out...

20:17.440 --> 20:20.740
he sat down, he wrote two letters
and gave them to his successor.

20:20.740 --> 20:25.540
He said, "When you get yourself
into a situation you can't get out of..."

20:26.580 --> 20:30.250
open the first letter,
and you'll be saved.

20:30.250 --> 20:33.420
And when you get yourself into
another situation you can't get out of...

20:33.420 --> 20:35.590
"open the second letter."

20:35.590 --> 20:38.920
Well, soon enough,
this guy found himself in a tight place...

20:38.920 --> 20:43.720
so he opened the first letter, which said,
"BIame everything on me."

20:44.560 --> 20:47.390
So, he blamed the old man.
lt worked like a charm.

20:47.390 --> 20:50.100
He got himself into a second situation
he couldn't get out of...

20:50.100 --> 20:52.100
and he opened the second letter.

20:52.100 --> 20:56.770
lt said,
"Sit down and write two letters."

21:00.610 --> 21:03.910
Yeah.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.250
Don't you want to know
what kind of car it is?

21:17.250 --> 21:22.050
- lt's a brown Ford Explorer.
- lt was here. lt's been stolen. l want to file a report.

21:22.050 --> 21:25.260
A report will not help you
find your car.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.810
- The police won't find your car.
- You are the police.

21:28.810 --> 21:33.610
- You call this man... and he'll find your car.
- l don't get it.

21:34.520 --> 21:37.480
How is this guy gonna know
who has our car?

21:37.480 --> 21:39.650
The police will telI him.

21:39.650 --> 21:42.320
Why will they teIl him,
and they won't telI us?

21:42.320 --> 21:44.360
Because we pay him, stupid.

21:44.360 --> 21:47.160
Right? And he pays the police,
and suddenly our car appears.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.330
Es correct.
Es correct.

21:50.330 --> 21:54.000
Just give him the money.
Give him the money.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.830
- Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
- Here, take it.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.380
- No. No, no.
- No, please, take it.

21:59.380 --> 22:03.170
Let's start moving to the sidewalk.
Let's go to the sidewalk.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.770
Call the man.
Have a nice day.

22:24.530 --> 22:27.700
- Javier Rodriguez.
<i>- Sí.</i>

22:44.680 --> 22:46.500
<i>Bien.</i>

22:57.400 --> 22:59.610
<i>I would say one thing</i>
<i>to you, Judge...</i>

22:59.610 --> 23:03.070
and that's you're never gonna solve
this problem on the supply side.

23:03.070 --> 23:05.740
As long as that demand
is out there in our cities...

23:05.740 --> 23:08.280
Mexico bashing is not gonna do
a damn thing for you.

23:08.280 --> 23:12.740
We in the legal drug business - Merck and Pfizer
and the rest of my very important clients -

23:12.740 --> 23:16.620
realize that we're not fighting a war here
with a traditional winner and loser.

23:16.620 --> 23:18.620
l don't know that
you can win this war.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.630
Everybody says we want
to declare war on drugs...

23:20.630 --> 23:24.090
but if 25% of high school seniors
are using drugs -

23:24.090 --> 23:27.090
- lf you reduce that to 10, that's a great improvement.
- Right.

23:27.090 --> 23:29.590
l'll congratulate you.
That would be a phenomenal achievement...

23:29.590 --> 23:32.680
but you'd still have 10%
habitually using drugs.

23:32.680 --> 23:34.970
Can l get a scotch and soda, please?

23:34.980 --> 23:37.440
The price of coke
and heroin has dropped...

23:37.440 --> 23:40.190
but purity has increased.

23:40.190 --> 23:43.820
AIl this law enforcement has reaIly achieved
is that kids get better stuff cheaper.

23:43.820 --> 23:46.440
Education, rehabilitation, prevention -

23:46.450 --> 23:48.450
that's not significant to these reporters.

23:48.450 --> 23:50.450
They want to see people in prison.

23:50.450 --> 23:53.490
They want to see the gory aspect
of the drug problem.

23:53.490 --> 23:55.490
Thank you so much for sharing
your point of view.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.960
- l look forward to working with you in the future.
- WeIl, call me.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.460
l have a good bill on treatment-on-demand.
l could use your help.

24:00.460 --> 24:03.000
- WonderfuI. Look forward to it. Thanks, Senator.
- Okay. Great.

24:03.000 --> 24:06.010
lf a judge or a politician is willing
to put a reefer in their mouth...

24:06.010 --> 24:08.010
- l'll do a story on it.
- Right.

24:08.010 --> 24:10.010
- Stand up and be independent.
- Right.

24:10.010 --> 24:12.470
l don't care who's president.
l don't care who the members of congress are.

24:12.470 --> 24:14.470
l don't care who you have to deal with.

24:14.470 --> 24:19.190
lf you're independent and you use that
bully pulpit right, that's where your power is.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.190
lt's the stick of law enforcement
that creates...

24:21.190 --> 24:23.310
the carrot of huge profit
that is economic truth.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.630
Addicts don't vote.

24:31.910 --> 24:34.220
What the hell are you doing here?

24:35.990 --> 24:38.800
You like your view?

24:39.370 --> 24:42.870
- TV screen big enough?
- How's the food?

24:45.170 --> 24:47.800
Ηope it's all good
because this is as good as it's gonna get...

24:47.800 --> 24:49.720
for a long, long time, Eduardo.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.630
Look, l'm a legitimate businessman.

24:51.640 --> 24:54.050
- l've got tuna boats. l'm a fisherman.
- Shut the fuck up!

24:54.050 --> 24:56.060
- Check it out!
- Shut the fuck up!

24:56.060 --> 24:58.560
- Fucking can it, bitch!
- You can't come in here like that!

24:58.560 --> 25:00.430
- l want to see my lawyer.
- Okay.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.850
lt's cool, man.

25:02.850 --> 25:05.980
- Eddie... you're in a lot of trouble.
- lt's cool.

25:10.530 --> 25:13.700
You know what? The amount of coke
we found on this creep -

25:13.700 --> 25:17.080
- that's capital punishment in some states, right?
- Yeah, down in Texas.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.080
- They'll fry him.
- Definitely.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.080
We've got him making
the deal on tape.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.000
We got him bragging
about the quality, about his business.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.540
- We got this motherfucker.
- You're fucked.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.960
No, no, he's fucked.

25:32.380 --> 25:36.070
l only see one way
out of this predicament.

25:42.020 --> 25:44.440
You make us believe
you got a boss, Eddie.

25:46.440 --> 25:48.570
Look, no boss, it's all on you.

25:48.570 --> 25:50.610
No.

25:50.610 --> 25:53.530
No, that's a death sentence.
l'd never make it to the trial.

25:53.530 --> 25:57.490
Look, we're gonna protect you.

25:57.490 --> 26:00.450
- Who you working for?
- This is coercion.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.540
That's a big word
for a fisherman.

26:04.540 --> 26:07.630
Big-ass word.
Who you working for?

26:07.630 --> 26:10.920
l know another big word.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.330
lmmunity.

26:18.930 --> 26:20.970
Take it easy, will you?

26:20.970 --> 26:22.980
What's going on in here?

26:22.980 --> 26:25.140
- We have a warrant to search your premises.
- What?

26:25.150 --> 26:27.190
Carl!

26:27.190 --> 26:29.440
My husband!

26:29.440 --> 26:31.440
- Relax. Ma'am.
- Carl!

26:31.440 --> 26:33.820
Ma'am, right here.
You can't go any further.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.660
- David, come here!
- Ma'am, l have a search warrant.

26:36.660 --> 26:38.490
He'll be back.

26:38.490 --> 26:42.910
Where are they taking Daddy?

26:42.910 --> 26:45.270
Ηe'll be all right.

26:46.630 --> 26:48.960
Ηe's all right. They're just gonna
take him to the office and talk.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.960
Just relax.
They're not going to hurt him.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.300
- l don't understand what's going on.
- He'Il be alI right.

26:53.300 --> 26:55.970
- What are they doing to Daddy?
- Daddy's gonna be okay.

26:55.970 --> 27:00.400
lt's okay, sweetheart.
lt's okay, baby.

29:33.630 --> 29:38.130
Well... is this a surprise or what?

29:38.130 --> 29:40.300
An honor.
Thank you.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.630
- Hi, sweetie.
- Good trip?

29:42.630 --> 29:46.550
- How are you?
- Good trip. l'm good. l just can't believe this.

29:46.550 --> 29:50.310
- What's Washington like?
- What's Washington like? lt's like,

29:50.310 --> 29:53.480
lt's like Calcutta;
surrounded by beggars.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.480
Only these beggars
are wearing $1,500 suits...

29:56.480 --> 30:00.070
and they don't say
"please" and "thank you."

30:01.900 --> 30:04.530
<i>So, we put the case</i>
<i>before the arbitration panel...</i>

30:04.530 --> 30:07.030
none of whom have any expertise.

30:07.030 --> 30:09.030
"Superfund" is just one of those words.

30:09.040 --> 30:11.040
People stop paying attention.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.540
- lt's frustrating.
- lt's so frustrating.

30:15.540 --> 30:17.540
Did you meet the president?

30:17.540 --> 30:20.130
Honey, your father
knows the president.

30:20.130 --> 30:23.170
lt just so happens -
that the president of the United States...

30:23.170 --> 30:25.180
my new boss,
the leader of the free world...

30:25.180 --> 30:28.920
has penciled me in
for a little face time.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.770
None of my friends can fucking believe
my dad's actually the drug czar.

30:31.770 --> 30:33.560
Caroline.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.560
l'm sorry, but, I mean, come on.

30:37.730 --> 30:39.860
lt's great.
lt's great, Daddy.

30:39.860 --> 30:44.090
lt's just amazing, that's all.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.240
Arnie, thank God.

30:51.240 --> 30:53.620
Helena, l am so -

30:53.620 --> 30:55.870
Please tell me
what's going on here.

30:55.870 --> 30:58.880
What is going on? They came into the house.
They just took him away.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.550
They searched my home.

31:01.550 --> 31:04.450
Let me tell you what's happening.
All right?

31:05.380 --> 31:08.890
First of alI, CarI is not here.

31:08.890 --> 31:11.390
The D.E.A. has got him.

31:11.390 --> 31:13.560
They're gonna hang onto him
until his arraignment...

31:13.560 --> 31:16.060
which will probably be tomorrow.

31:16.060 --> 31:20.060
So here you are wasting your time.
AIl right? Are you with me?

31:20.060 --> 31:23.610
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, do not discuss anything...

31:23.610 --> 31:26.240
over the telephone.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.530
Don't talk to your neighbors.
Stay out of your yard.

31:29.530 --> 31:32.410
- What is he charged with, Arnie?
- l don't know.

31:32.410 --> 31:37.210
But under no circumstances
am l gonna talk about it here. Okay?

31:37.290 --> 31:39.170
Now, you go home...

31:39.170 --> 31:41.920
and you be with your son.
All right?

32:36.140 --> 32:38.140
Miss?

32:38.140 --> 32:40.600
Can l have a Budweiser?

32:48.700 --> 32:51.860
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

32:51.870 --> 32:55.510
Can you give me a cigarette?

34:21.290 --> 34:26.090
<i>AlI l'm saying -</i>
<i>What I'm - What I'm saying is...</i>

34:26.250 --> 34:30.590
it never seems like anyone ever says
anything that matters to them.

34:30.590 --> 34:35.090
We alI look at each other
and nod with these -

34:35.090 --> 34:39.889
these responses
that we've been trained to make.

34:41.060 --> 34:43.270
Responses -
Not reaI responses.

34:43.270 --> 34:48.070
Social conventions,
like phony, fake smiles.

34:48.440 --> 34:50.610
Surface bullshit.

34:50.610 --> 34:52.780
Do l ever just say...

34:52.780 --> 34:56.610
"... l'm uncomfortable in this crowd."

34:56.610 --> 34:59.120
l don't know what the fuck
I'm doing either.

34:59.120 --> 35:03.450
"l know you're afraid,
and that's okay, you know, because -"

35:03.450 --> 35:07.290
Hello? Fucking... exactly.

35:07.290 --> 35:09.290
We act like we have all the answers
and we're totally invincible...

35:09.290 --> 35:11.290
Iike our parents seem
and their parents before them.

35:11.300 --> 35:14.630
l'm sorry that l have to be the one to say this,
but it's fucking bullshit.

35:14.630 --> 35:17.470
- For instance?
- l know you jack off to Caroline every night...

35:17.470 --> 35:19.640
instead of Vanessa,
who you're supposed to be in love with.

35:19.640 --> 35:23.470
Don't even get me started
on that convention.

35:23.470 --> 35:25.480
Because what is that convention?

35:25.480 --> 35:27.850
We're this random collection of self interests,
and all of a sudden we decide...

35:27.850 --> 35:32.520
that we're gonna walk two-by-two
down the fucking aisIe to Noah's Ark?

35:32.530 --> 35:36.320
Actually, for your information,
when l jerk off...

35:36.320 --> 35:39.820
l'm not just thinking about Caroline,
l'm thinking about you with Caroline.

35:39.820 --> 35:43.070
- So, how about that?
- Baby -

35:44.620 --> 35:49.420
That is what l'm talking about -
sarcasm.

35:50.290 --> 35:52.670
Always fucking sarcasm.

35:52.670 --> 35:56.340
You're afraid, and you think
that if you admit that...

35:56.340 --> 35:58.840
people will think
that you are weak...

35:58.840 --> 36:02.010
or they won't Iike you...

36:02.010 --> 36:05.680
or whatever it is
you think will happen, but -

36:05.680 --> 36:10.460
Can you shut up for one second
and listen to yourself?

36:11.110 --> 36:12.360
Wh-What?

36:12.360 --> 36:17.160
Because you are so fucking right.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.700
- l'm so fucking high.
- Yeah?

36:19.700 --> 36:22.070
- Yeah.
- Okay, wait.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.160
Why don't we...

36:24.160 --> 36:28.000
change this thing,
this sociaI pattern?

36:28.000 --> 36:29.750
Why don't we be different?

36:29.750 --> 36:33.340
- Yeah.
- But then why are you even talking about it?

36:33.340 --> 36:35.670
But we're making it, like, from now on.

36:35.670 --> 36:39.420
You're like,
"Why don't we do something?"

36:39.430 --> 36:41.930
- Why don't you do something?
- That's what l'm saying, Seth.

36:41.930 --> 36:45.430
- You do it yourself -
- l'm saying if you knew it, you wouldn't even say it.

36:45.430 --> 36:47.430
Vanessa, l'm serious, l feel fucked up.

36:47.430 --> 36:52.230
lt's a social pattern, you know?

36:55.270 --> 36:59.570
Spence, baby, are you all right?

36:59.570 --> 37:01.610
He's fucking bIue.
He isn't breathing.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.780
My God, Fucked-up Bowman's
fucked up.

37:04.780 --> 37:08.160
- Wait -
- What the fuck do we do?

37:08.160 --> 37:11.620
-  God -
- Fuck!

37:11.620 --> 37:15.630
- Somebody call a doctor!
- Wait, your dad's a doctor. Call him.

37:15.630 --> 37:18.050
No, he's a research -
Call your dad. He's a doctor.

37:18.050 --> 37:20.970
- What kind of research?
- Mapping the fucking pig genome.

37:20.970 --> 37:23.300
Call your dad!
Ηe's a neurosurgeon!

37:23.300 --> 37:25.470
l can't call my dad!
lt's 3:00 in the morning!

37:25.470 --> 37:29.600
He's gonna fucking die right here
on the floor if you don't do something!

37:29.600 --> 37:34.370
No, he can't die on the floor!
Ηis parents are in Barbados!

37:44.070 --> 37:46.040
Move! Move!

37:55.630 --> 37:57.200
Go!

38:04.720 --> 38:08.020
Okay, nobody has anything
on them, right?

38:09.390 --> 38:10.960
Fuck!

40:04.170 --> 40:07.860
l'm on the board
of my son's school.

40:08.970 --> 40:13.770
l have fund-raisers
for adult literacy at my own home.

40:15.770 --> 40:20.570
l think l have a right to know
if my husband is a legitimate businessman.

40:20.650 --> 40:23.230
Of course he is.

40:23.230 --> 40:28.030
l've known Carl for 20 years.
He doesn't even jaywalk.

40:31.780 --> 40:36.580
Carl is a very important member of this
community, and when we get through...

40:37.200 --> 40:39.790
suing the police and
the district attorney and the D.E.A....

40:39.790 --> 40:43.210
they're gonna be renaming
the public parks after your husband.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.230
Carl is very, very good
at his business.

40:54.810 --> 40:59.610
Which is smuggling
illegal drugs into this country.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.160
- They're whispering. They're whispering.
- l know.

41:15.160 --> 41:18.660
- Can't hear it. - l know. The fucking
bug's too far away from the room.

41:18.660 --> 41:21.080
It's halfway to the kitchen.
We're not gonna get shit.

41:21.080 --> 41:23.120
They're saying something.

41:23.130 --> 41:25.710
Sounds like they're conspiring
to conspire.

41:25.710 --> 41:28.340
l can feel the lies vibrating
from their home.

41:30.670 --> 41:32.630
l don't think she's in on it, man.

41:32.640 --> 41:36.350
Come on, l dream about this.
l have actual dreams about this.

41:36.350 --> 41:39.520
About busting the top people,
the rich people.

41:39.520 --> 41:42.270
- White people.
- White people. l know, l know.

41:42.270 --> 41:44.980
But l don't think she's in on it, man.

41:46.070 --> 41:48.190
She knows Arnie Metzger.

41:48.190 --> 41:50.820
So does half of San Diego.

41:50.820 --> 41:53.700
- You want to bet?
- Get in your pocket.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.870
- l got -
- l love it. l love it when you do this.

41:55.870 --> 41:59.870
- How much you want to bet? How much?
- I got - l got 12 bucks.

41:59.870 --> 42:03.540
- Okay, give me ten. We'll make it even.
- Okay.

42:03.540 --> 42:07.130
- Beautiful.
- Wait a minute. What?

42:10.550 --> 42:14.440
<i>- How old are you?</i>
<i>- Sixteen.</i>

42:15.850 --> 42:17.680
Live with your parents?

42:17.680 --> 42:19.250
Yes.

42:20.640 --> 42:22.600
Parents still together?

42:22.600 --> 42:24.370
Yes.

42:26.190 --> 42:28.060
Do you work?

42:28.070 --> 42:29.730
l voIunteer.

42:29.730 --> 42:34.530
l read to blind peopIe,
one day a week for two hours.

42:35.530 --> 42:37.240
ln school?

42:37.240 --> 42:38.820
Yes.

42:40.580 --> 42:42.250
Private?

42:42.250 --> 42:43.920
Yeah.

42:45.710 --> 42:48.560
How are your grades?

42:49.460 --> 42:53.010
- l'm third in my class.
- What does that mean?

42:53.010 --> 42:55.970
l get A's. All A's.

42:55.970 --> 42:57.890
You do?

42:57.890 --> 43:00.050
What else do you do?

43:00.720 --> 43:02.930
l'm a National Merit Finalist.

43:02.930 --> 43:06.020
l'm on the Ηi-Q Team
and the Math Τeam.

43:06.020 --> 43:08.770
l'm in the Spanish Club.
l'm a Thespian.

43:08.770 --> 43:11.940
l'm vice president of my class.

43:11.940 --> 43:14.210
l'm on the volIeyball team.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.630
You want to tell me
what you're doing here, Caroline?

43:40.180 --> 43:42.440
Carol.

43:43.640 --> 43:46.690
Sweetie.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.420
You okay?

43:52.690 --> 43:55.000
lt's okay.

43:55.610 --> 43:59.600
<i>Caroline, how welI</i>
<i>did you know this boy that overdosed?</i>

44:00.320 --> 44:02.490
Ηe didn't hang around us.

44:02.490 --> 44:05.290
He was like one
of those hippie kids.

44:05.290 --> 44:07.990
l'm not part of that group.

44:10.630 --> 44:15.250
How well did you know this boy Seth,
the one that was driving?

44:16.260 --> 44:18.670
Ηe's a friend.

44:19.800 --> 44:23.600
Ηe's also the only one that was doing
anything about the situation.

44:23.600 --> 44:28.060
Ηe definitely had a few beers, but...

44:28.060 --> 44:30.350
it's not like he wanted to drive.

44:30.350 --> 44:33.360
We just didn't know what else to do.

44:34.070 --> 44:36.430
lt wasn't my pot.

44:39.030 --> 44:43.120
Okay, we understand, honey.
We've got to talk.

44:43.120 --> 44:45.630
Alone.

44:53.380 --> 44:56.590
- l think she's lying.
- Me too.

44:56.590 --> 44:58.880
So let's ground her,
clip her wings.

44:58.880 --> 45:02.220
School, scheduled activities.
That's it till further notice.

45:02.220 --> 45:07.020
Robert, honey, Caroline
clearly used very bad judgment.

45:07.600 --> 45:12.400
But don't you think spending the night
in jail is punishment enough?

45:13.310 --> 45:16.230
l mean, we've all had our moments.

45:16.230 --> 45:20.450
- Lord knows, l tried every drug there was -
- l don't want to hear about that.

45:20.450 --> 45:23.360
You experimented
when you were in college.

45:23.370 --> 45:25.410
Shall we take the quotes off experiment
and call it what it was?

45:25.410 --> 45:26.740
- This is different.
- Why?

45:26.740 --> 45:28.830
Because she's 16 years old!

45:28.830 --> 45:32.750
l think she needs to find out
for herself, on her own.

45:32.750 --> 45:36.420
- We have to allow her room to figure out -
- You want to give her room?

45:36.420 --> 45:38.980
So she can O.D.
like that other kid?

45:39.260 --> 45:43.590
l am not sending out the message that
our family will accept this kind of behavior...

45:43.590 --> 45:44.890
because we do not.

45:44.890 --> 45:48.870
- Correct?
- Of course, but we don't want to push her away.

45:48.930 --> 45:53.730
She has to know that we understand
what she's exposed to.

45:54.150 --> 45:56.510
How long have you known about this?

45:58.610 --> 46:01.460
How long have you known?

46:04.620 --> 46:06.190
Six months.

47:12.180 --> 47:15.230
...Francisco Flores.

47:51.220 --> 47:55.060
Your Honor, this is a man who heads
a large criminal organization...

47:55.060 --> 47:59.560
with international contacts
we can only begin to understand.

47:59.560 --> 48:02.230
Our case against him is very strong.

48:02.230 --> 48:06.900
Ηe is not a flight risk.
His flight is assured.

48:06.900 --> 48:11.480
The people ask that Your Honor
deny bail. Thank you.

48:12.080 --> 48:14.240
My cIient is no more a fIight risk...

48:14.240 --> 48:16.450
than Your Honor or the able prosecutor.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.580
Ηe's a pillar of his community;

48:18.580 --> 48:22.500
a family man with a wife and child
living in La Jolla...

48:22.500 --> 48:25.130
the community where he has made
his home for the past 20 years.

48:25.130 --> 48:27.130
As our defense wiIl quickly show...

48:27.130 --> 48:29.130
my client is guilty of nothing more...

48:29.130 --> 48:32.140
than being the handy target
of an admitted criminal.

48:32.140 --> 48:36.170
Therefore, we ask that you release
Carl Ayala on his own recognizance.

48:37.100 --> 48:39.360
l'm going to deny bail.

49:10.510 --> 49:13.470
<i>l appreciate you</i>
<i>coming in so earIy this morning.</i>

49:13.470 --> 49:15.810
<i>Judge Wakefield,</i>
<i>it's an honor to handle it for you.</i>

49:15.810 --> 49:18.980
<i>She's a minor. lt probably wouId have</i>
<i>expunged on her 18th birthday anyway.</i>

49:18.980 --> 49:23.780
<i>NevertheIess, this is a sensitive issue for me.</i>
<i>l'm sure you can understand that.</i>

49:23.980 --> 49:27.650
<i>Like l said, open container,</i>
<i>P.l., misdemeanor possession.</i>

49:27.650 --> 49:29.650
<i>It's easy to make it go away.</i>

49:29.650 --> 49:34.450
One thing bothers me: That kid they
dropped off had coke and heroin in him.

49:35.370 --> 49:38.080
Serious amounts.
He's lucky he's alive.

49:38.080 --> 49:40.830
So l've got to ask:
What's your daughter on?

49:40.830 --> 49:43.210
l don't know what you mean.

49:43.210 --> 49:48.010
Well, l mean... have you asked her
what kind of drugs she's tried?

49:52.010 --> 49:54.010
No.

49:54.010 --> 49:56.130
l don't know.

49:57.430 --> 50:01.020
- ls she in any kind of therapy or professional help?
- No, no, no. No way.

50:01.020 --> 50:04.610
My daughter is one of
the leading students in her school.

50:08.940 --> 50:12.140
Well, l hope it stays that way.

50:20.200 --> 50:22.250
<i>Yeah, hi, it's Robert.</i>

50:22.250 --> 50:26.130
l want you to clean out my schedule
for the next three days.

50:26.130 --> 50:30.340
Because l'm tired of talking to experts
who've never Ieft the beltway.

50:30.340 --> 50:33.590
lt's time to see the front lines.

51:08.090 --> 51:11.250
<i>Carlos Ayala started out</i>
<i>in the family connection business -</i>

51:11.250 --> 51:13.970
<i>real estate in Tijuana,</i>
<i>fishing boats out of Ensenada...</i>

51:13.970 --> 51:16.260
hydroponic strawberries.

51:16.260 --> 51:18.840
Then he met up with the Obregón brothers
of the Tijuana cartel.

51:18.850 --> 51:21.350
Using regression analysis,
we made a study...

51:21.350 --> 51:25.390
of the custom lines at the border
and calculated the odds of a search.

51:25.390 --> 51:28.560
The odds are not high, and we found
variables to further reduce those odds.

51:28.560 --> 51:31.270
So, you pay off customs officials?

51:31.270 --> 51:34.940
Well, you know, in, in Mexico...

51:34.950 --> 51:38.280
law enforcement is
an entrepreneuriaI activity.

51:38.280 --> 51:40.990
Not so much in the States.
Anyway, we,

51:40.990 --> 51:44.250
We hire drivers with nothing to lose
and throw a lot of product at the problem.

51:44.250 --> 51:47.120
Some get stopped. Enough get through.
lt's not difficult.

51:47.120 --> 51:51.920
Look, boys, this has worked for years.
lt's gonna continue to work for years.

51:52.300 --> 51:55.840
NAFΤA makes things even more difficult for you
because the border's disappearing.

51:55.840 --> 51:59.470
Do you realize in the next year or two
at the outside Mexican trucking companies...

51:59.470 --> 52:02.640
are gonna be able to go from the States
to Mexico and back again...

52:02.640 --> 52:06.640
with the same freedom
as U.P.S., D.H.L., FedEx?

52:06.640 --> 52:11.440
- lt's gonna be a free-for-all.
- What, are we on Larry King or something?

52:11.860 --> 52:14.230
Shit.

52:14.230 --> 52:16.820
Tell us something
we don't know, Eddie.

52:16.820 --> 52:20.160
You guys remind me of those Japanese soldiers
left behind on deserted islands...

52:20.160 --> 52:22.990
who think World War ll
is still going on.

52:22.990 --> 52:27.540
Let me be the first to tell you, your government
surrendered this war a long time ago.

52:27.540 --> 52:30.710
I don't think all this attitude
is gonna help him any in front of a jury.

52:30.710 --> 52:34.690
- lt's really a bad attitude.
- Very bad. Very bad.

52:35.840 --> 52:40.020
Look, Ed, there's only one problem
with all this math. You're in here.

52:42.680 --> 52:44.680
Well, l got greedy, didn't l?

52:44.680 --> 52:47.020
- Yes, you did.
- Yeah.

52:47.020 --> 52:50.480
Decided to bring a little in on my own
and somebody tipped you off.

52:50.480 --> 52:53.020
Carl never would have been so stupid.

52:53.020 --> 52:57.500
Well, CarI hired you.
That was a mistake.

52:59.740 --> 53:03.230
CarI and l have been friends
since we were little kids.

53:04.200 --> 53:06.460
Ηe was loyal.

57:40.350 --> 57:42.350
<i>The port of San Ysidro, CaIifornia:</i>

57:42.350 --> 57:46.360
<i>45,000 vehicles on average,</i>
<i>25,000 pedestrians per day.</i>

57:51.780 --> 57:55.700
- ln the last six months, a threefold increase?
- lncrease in narcotics seizures.

57:55.700 --> 57:59.540
Would that mean, pro rata,
three times as much drugs is getting in?

57:59.540 --> 58:02.830
That's a scary way to figure it,
but l believe that's true.

58:02.830 --> 58:06.250
<i>ln my heart, l'd love to say</i>
<i>that we were getting 60 or 70%.</i>

58:06.250 --> 58:11.050
<i>ln the reality, we're more like 40 or</i>
<i>50% of the total that's approaching us.</i>

58:11.170 --> 58:13.510
<i>And it's all big-doIlar issues now.</i>

58:13.510 --> 58:15.510
That's the reason you're seeing
a lot of these murders taking place.

58:15.510 --> 58:17.930
lt's one organization
fighting another organization.

58:17.930 --> 58:19.930
When things are good,
people don't kiIl each other.

58:19.930 --> 58:22.100
When things are bad,
when they're losing dope...

58:22.100 --> 58:24.100
when they're losing drivers
and guys are going to jail...

58:24.100 --> 58:26.510
people start killing each other.

58:34.820 --> 58:38.780
- How's David?
- "How's David?"

58:38.790 --> 58:42.540
- He's terrific, Carl. Terrific.
- Helena -

58:42.540 --> 58:44.920
He watched his father
being dragged away by federal agents.

58:44.920 --> 58:48.000
- He's just doing fine.
- Okay.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.750
I can't even begin
to tell him where you are...

58:50.760 --> 58:53.420
and when you're coming home,
if you're ever coming home.

58:53.430 --> 58:57.590
Ηelena... we're gonna get through this.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.600
l promise.

58:59.600 --> 59:04.140
- l'll make it up to you.
- Do you have any idea what's going on out here?

59:04.140 --> 59:07.830
Our credit cards are maxed.

59:08.150 --> 59:12.730
The people in the bank - you should see
the way they look at me when l walk in there.

59:12.740 --> 59:14.950
l have a letter
from the government telling me...

59:14.950 --> 59:18.950
anything l sell from the house
will be taken against an income tax lien.

59:18.950 --> 59:22.200
Our fucking friends -

59:22.200 --> 59:25.790
Nobody will heIp us.
Nobody will take us in.

59:25.790 --> 59:28.920
Nobody wants anything
to do with us, Carl.

59:28.920 --> 59:32.760
So, you just telI me
how you're gonna make it up to me.

59:33.470 --> 59:36.180
Helena -

59:36.180 --> 59:39.300
Just tell me what to do.

59:39.300 --> 59:42.470
I'm not bringing a child into the life
that I was brought up into.

59:42.470 --> 59:44.930
l won't do it, Carl.

59:44.930 --> 59:48.530
l want our Iife back.

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.790
Yeah, we're smarter.
We know the difference.

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:48.620
Hello. Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:51.500
- Hi, folks. - Hello.
- Hi. Room 310, pIease.

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:56.300
- Okay, l need to see some l.D.s, please, and $28.
- Okay.

01:00:58.050 --> 01:01:00.510
Man, l love this place.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:27.580
l wish we could just stay here.

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.580
Just be here forever and ever and...

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:34.730
make a little home here.

01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:49.180
l want to,

01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:53.980
l want to have sex and then do a hit
right as we're both coming.

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:02.710
Okay.

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.190
The first time l got laid
was on a beach just like that.

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:45.160
- You got a what on a beach?
- Got laid, man.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.990
Lost my virginity,
was a sophomore in high school.

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:50.800
- Τhat's cool.
- Yeah, it was sweet.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:53.850
Did he treat you good?

01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.520
- Who's this guy?
- l don't know.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.750
- l never seen him before.
- He's going right for the kid.

01:03:18.270 --> 01:03:20.540
David!

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:25.150
David, come back here!

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.820
- Mom, Mom.
- Please, put down my son.

01:03:28.830 --> 01:03:31.330
<i>Shouldn't let your kid wander off with strangers.</i>

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:35.290
<i>Karen, if he
tries to move with that kid, you break cover.</i>

01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:39.880
Mrs. Ayala, your husband owes a lot of money.
Snapping this kid's neck wouldn't cover it.

01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:42.880
You better come up with it in a hurry
or your kid is gonna disappear...

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:45.630
and he won't turn up
until the evening news.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:49.860
You get only one warning.
First payment is $3 million.

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:18.630
- Javier.
<i>- Sí?</i>

01:04:40.100 --> 01:04:42.420
No.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:55.930
- No.
- No?

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:30.840
No.

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:03.510
Javier Rodríguez.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:30.880
- John, how are you? Bob WakefieId, pleasure.
- Judge, welcome.

01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:33.130
- Good to see you. How are you?
- Long time, no see.

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:34.590
<i>EPlC is very unique.</i>

01:06:34.590 --> 01:06:39.390
<i>lt's a facility that has over 15</i>
<i>different agencies - state and local -</i>

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:42.350
<i>that participate</i>
<i>in gathering intelligence...</i>

01:06:42.350 --> 01:06:44.730
and making sure
that information gets out...

01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:48.820
to people in the field that need it
to stop drug trafficking.

01:06:48.820 --> 01:06:53.620
From here, we have the ability
to track vessels, airplanes, boats...

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:55.950
anything that carries drugs.

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:59.410
When the information comes in,
we're able to check with different databases...

01:06:59.410 --> 01:07:01.410
to see if it's in the system or not.

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:04.250
And wouId most of that energy
be focused on the two cartels?

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:08.750
The Juarez, the Obregón brothers - Are those
the two that wouId be most important?

01:07:08.750 --> 01:07:11.460
Those are the two
clearest threats right now.

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:14.220
They are the dominant force
in trafficking...

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:16.380
both on the Mexican side
and in the U.S.

01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:19.600
How are the cartels achieving...

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.850
the leveI of intelIigence and
sophistication that they're showing?

01:07:22.850 --> 01:07:25.940
- Craig, why don't you answer that?
- An unlimited budget.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:28.610
So, you're saying, actually,
that even a country of our size...

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.110
and the budget that we throw
towards this issue...

01:07:31.110 --> 01:07:35.400
- they can compete at the same level?
- No, they're way beyond us.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:36.740
"Way beyond"?

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.540
Our budgetary process
makes us pale in comparison.

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:46.540
That house you're looking at over there
used to belong to Porfirio Madrigal.

01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.000
His nickname was Scorpion.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.170
l'll let you figure out
what that means.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.800
Wasn't that the guy
who died during plastic surgery?

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.130
Best of our information, yes.

01:07:56.130 --> 01:07:58.720
Who do you interact with
on that side?

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.140
Nobody.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.850
Well, who has my job in Mexico?

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:07.590
Your position doesn't exist
over there yet.

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:17.609
<i>l want everyone thinking out of the box...</i>

01:08:17.609 --> 01:08:19.660
<i>for the next few minutes.</i>

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.450
What are we doing about Mexico?

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:25.790
- Come on, guys, out of the box.
- Unlimited funds?

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:28.000
Unlimited.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.960
From a D.E.A. standpoint, we need
a vetted task force and matching funds.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.710
And cut the red tape on getting them
equipment and training.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.760
Come on, guys,
l want to hear from everyone:

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:41.060
F.B.l., customs, treatment.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.350
- ls there anybody from treatment on this plane?
- No, Judge.

01:08:44.350 --> 01:08:47.520
Then l want to know why there isn't
anybody from treatment on this plane.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.600
Yes, sir.

01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:53.689
We need to take down one of
these cartels - either Juarez or Tijuana -

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:55.859
not because they're a symbol, but -

01:08:55.859 --> 01:09:00.660
Hell, they are a symbol.
But because we need to send a message.

01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:04.700
When Carlos Ayala hires Michael Adler
as his legal defense...

01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.870
l send Ben Williams
down to San Diego as a prosecutor.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.870
Why? Because it's a symbol.

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:14.210
lt's a symbol that
we are sending the best.

01:09:14.210 --> 01:09:18.840
lt's a message that we're
going after their top guys.

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:21.380
So...

01:09:21.390 --> 01:09:23.850
right now...

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:26.550
on this flight only...

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:29.729
the dam is open...

01:09:29.729 --> 01:09:32.090
for new ideas.

01:09:43.069 --> 01:09:45.910
On a clear day,
you can see Mexico City.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:49.580
l have this place swept twice a day,
so just feel free to talk.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:53.580
I learned that back in Miami in '85.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.750
U.S. shut down the entire Caribbean.

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:58.420
lt's a big game of whack-a-mole.
You knock it down in Miami -

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:00.760
Arnie, l need money.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:03.590
Somebody - l think it was the Obregóns -
threatened David.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.930
They want a first payment
of $3 million.

01:10:06.930 --> 01:10:10.270
Helena.

01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:13.770
I'd give it to you myseIf,
but l-l-I just don't have that kind of money.

01:10:13.770 --> 01:10:15.770
Please. Does anyone owe us money?

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:20.440
Yes, there are people that do owe you money,
but nobody's gonna pay.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:23.790
Carl's got too much heat on him.

01:10:24.450 --> 01:10:27.620
What about our other businesses,
our legitimate businesses?

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:31.620
- Don't we own a construction concern?
- Laundromats wash the money.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.040
Just tell me something
positive, Arnie.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.790
Give me some good news,
for Christ's sake.

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:39.160
l'm sorry.

01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:47.320
l just keep wondering what's gonna happen
if he doesn't get out.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.680
Just never been on my own before.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.030
Always had someone. Always.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:06.410
l remember the first time
that l saw you -

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:11.700
little Helen Watts
from the wrong side of somewhere.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:16.500
Somehow l knew even then that your
survival skills were pretty well honed.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.400
Glad you think so, Arnie.

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:26.130
l just keep picturing a debt-ridden,
30-year-old mother of two...

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:30.940
whose ex-husband
is being compared to Pablo Escobar.

01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:36.980
I don't know anyone who wants
to be with someone Iike that.

01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:41.040
Do you?

01:15:02.060 --> 01:15:05.230
<i>l think we</i>
<i>may have found our Mexican drug czar.</i>

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:08.230
General Salazar.

01:15:08.230 --> 01:15:11.280
Be nice to have somebody
to work with down there.

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:15.410
Does this mean you're
gonna be gone more?

01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:18.010
Possibly, yeah.

01:15:19.790 --> 01:15:23.910
You might want to pencil in
a little face time with your daughter.

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:26.750
- Barbara -
- Because l'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.

01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:30.000
I think it's important we maintain
a unified front here, Barbara.

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.210
lf you start in on the war metaphors...

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:34.420
l'm gonna drive this car
into a fucking telephone pole.

01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:38.090
- l am as worried as you are.
- L don't think so.

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:40.100
"Leave me alone.
Give me some money."

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.560
That's what l get from our daughter.

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:46.190
She has a way of shutting me out
that seems very familiar.

01:15:46.190 --> 01:15:50.990
Well, she has a way of self-medicating
that I'm sure is very familiar to you.

01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:55.610
l'm not the one who has
to have three scotches...

01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:57.610
just to walk in the house
and say hello.

01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:00.950
l have one drink before dinner
to take the edge off. lt's different.

01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:05.750
- Is it?
- Otherwise, l would be dying of boredom.

01:16:21.890 --> 01:16:26.420
Why don't you go in and tell
your daughter how bored you are?

01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:25.540
CaroIine, open this door immediately.

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:28.790
Who is it?
l'm going to the bathroom.

01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:31.640
- Open the goddamn door!
- One minute.

01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:40.870
Excuse me.
l have to go to bed.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.580
Jesus.

01:17:47.390 --> 01:17:49.110
My God.

01:17:51.230 --> 01:17:56.030
You are not going anywhere, young lady.
You stay right there.

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.010
Where are they?

01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:07.910
Where the hell are the drugs?

01:18:07.910 --> 01:18:10.080
Where are they?

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:12.100
Fuck you.

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:15.590
Fuck you.
l wasn't doing anything.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.750
You're like the Gestapo.

01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:21.590
Fuck me. Fuck me.

01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:24.300
Well, fuck you!

01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:14.690
- Javier, good to see you.
- How you doing, partner?

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.980
Did you take the precautions
we discussed about being followed?

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.320
- Yes, of course.
- Will you move to the middle, please?

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:22.320
- You're not carrying a weapon?
- No.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.820
- Of course not.
- Where are you taking me?

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:27.820
- Somewhere safe.
- Where?

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:30.620
A place we have that we know is protected.
He's good. Let's go.

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:32.910
- No, no. No, no, no.
- Don't worry. lt's really safe.

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:35.710
No, no, no, no, no.
This is safe. This is safe.

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:38.330
Come on, Javier, close the door.
Everything is cool, all right?

01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:40.500
- This is safe.
- Come on.

01:19:41.170 --> 01:19:43.670
All right.

01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:46.300
Where would you like to go?

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:50.290
Where do you want to go, Javier?

01:19:58.610 --> 01:20:03.400
l believe it's important
that we work together.

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:07.200
Mexico and the United States.
One hand washing the other.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.030
We agree.

01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:13.830
So, maybe you can tell me
about your informants in our operations.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:20.100
We thought that maybe you'd have
that kind of information for us.

01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.130
This is a very different
proposition, my friend.

01:20:24.130 --> 01:20:27.180
We pay for that kind
of information.

01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:31.850
ls that what
you're talking about, Javier?

01:20:31.850 --> 01:20:34.360
Getting paid?

01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:39.760
You like baseball?

01:20:43.230 --> 01:20:48.030
We need lights for the parks
so kids can play at night.

01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:51.410
So it's safe.

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:54.490
So they can play baseball.

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:57.580
So they no become -

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.580
Everybody like baseball.

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:02.670
Everybody likes parks.

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:04.690
Listen.

01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:10.220
l believe it's important that
the United State take an interest...

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:12.730
in Tijuana now.

01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:17.730
That's what l'm talking about,
my friends.

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:20.600
<i>Account number...</i>

01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:25.400
<i>8201 -4302-8091...</i>

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:28.430
2431.

01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:32.240
A cash advance.

01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:40.890
How much can l get?

01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:45.150
That's it?

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:50.970
You ever try the patch, man?

01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:52.970
- The what?
- The patch.

01:21:52.970 --> 01:21:56.810
- That shit doesn't work, bro.
- lt worked for my cousin.

01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:58.520
- No shit?
- Yeah.

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.480
l mean, he had to wear about
five or six of 'em at a time, but it worked.

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.380
- So, how's he doing now?
- He's dead.

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.570
- He's dead?
- lt wasn't from the patch, man.

01:22:09.570 --> 01:22:12.320
<i>- Okay, she's coming out.</i>
- On it.

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:15.320
- What did he die from?
- His wife shot him.

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:19.040
<i>She's leaving her property.</i>

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.160
Where the hell is she going?

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:23.170
Maybe her neighbors.

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:26.500
No, l don't think the neighbors are fucking
with her too much right about now.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:29.550
What does she have in her hand there?

01:22:32.180 --> 01:22:35.620
<i>She seems to be headed for the van.</i>

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:42.520
Shit.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.650
- What - Wh-What do we do?
- l-l don't know. What do we do?

01:22:46.650 --> 01:22:48.610
- What do you think she wants, man?
- She's your girlfriend.

01:22:48.610 --> 01:22:50.690
You think she'll invite you
to her baby shower?

01:22:50.690 --> 01:22:52.700
- Just say hello. Work it.
- All right, all right, all right.

01:22:52.700 --> 01:22:55.030
<i>She's waiting outside the van.</i>

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:57.700
- Hello?
- Would you like some lemonade?

01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:01.870
- l was just making some.
- You want some lemonade?

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:03.870
Sure.

01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:08.210
l know this is a difficult situation,
and you're only doing your jobs.

01:23:08.210 --> 01:23:11.710
l don't wish you guys
any ill will or anything like that.

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:13.970
But I have a favor to ask you.

01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:16.220
You're asking us for a favor?

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:18.550
Some man threatened my child.

01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:20.560
These charges have created
so much attention...

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:24.730
it seems to be bringing
all the nut jobs out of the nut jar.

01:23:24.730 --> 01:23:28.220
Would you keep an eye out
for anything out of the ordinary?

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.230
- Sure.
- Yeah, of course we will.

01:23:31.230 --> 01:23:33.900
- l'd really appreciate it.
- Sure.

01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:36.610
- Thanks.
- Thank you for the lemonade.

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.420
You're welcome.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:49.670
l'm gonna get this analyzed
right away, bro.

01:23:51.800 --> 01:23:54.970
<i>So, it was my birthday...</i>

01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:57.930
<i>and my ex-wife</i>
<i>was getting remarried...</i>

01:23:57.930 --> 01:24:00.930
<i>and l was in some church basement</i>
<i>telling a bunch of strangers...</i>

01:24:00.930 --> 01:24:03.020
<i>it was a good day because...</i>

01:24:03.020 --> 01:24:05.820
l didn't have to eat
out of a Dumpster.

01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:09.770
That was enough to send me
out on a pretty big one.

01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:13.280
I've been thinking a lot
about the first step -

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:17.110
that l came to believe
l was powerless over alcohol...

01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:19.280
and that my life
had become unmanageable.

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.790
My disease tells me
that l don't have a disease...

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:25.450
that it's my birthday
and l can have one little beer...

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:29.290
one little line, a little Valium.

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:33.960
Six months later, l wake up
in a sober-living house in Philly.

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.630
l'm from Dallas, people.

01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:40.300
lt's a disease,
an allergy of the body...

01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:42.810
an obsession of the mind.

01:24:42.810 --> 01:24:45.140
So, my name is Marty...

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:49.310
and today l'm a grateful,
recovering alcoholic.

01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:54.110
And it's a good day because
l didn't have to eat out of a Dumpster.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:56.800
Thanks.

01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:01.530
Hi.

01:25:02.490 --> 01:25:07.160
l'm Caroline.
l'm not sure l'm an alcoholic.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:11.960
I mean... l don't realIy like to drink.

01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:18.300
For someone my age, it's a lot easier
to get drugs than it is to get alcohol.

01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:27.260
l guess l'm angry.

01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.690
I mean, I think l'm really angry
about a lot of stuff.

01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:38.360
l'm just... not sure what.

01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:27.240
Listen to me.
l built our house...

01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:29.850
and l'm not gonna lose it.

01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:34.590
<i>My business -</i>

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:40.220
that would take a lot
of private study.

01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:49.600
l suggest... you look into the Coronel.

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.220
The painting?

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:54.440
<i>Into selling it.</i>

01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.000
<i>lf you can stomach it...</i>

01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:00.870
you should look into it.

01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:48.340
My God.

01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:47.630
<i>Dear Judge...</i>

01:28:47.630 --> 01:28:51.720
l recruited the best men
in Mexico for my task force.

01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:56.520
l make the selection, putting them
under a rigorous screening process.

01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.730
And not only physically,
but also psychologically.

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:05.860
Judge, l'm sorry for boxes
and the paintings and things...

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:10.110
but l have been too busy
to completely settle in here.

01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:12.910
I know you've made very good progress
with the Tijuana cartel.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:15.240
- Congratulations, General.
<i>- Muchas gracias.</i>

01:29:15.250 --> 01:29:19.540
l am confident
that before the end of the year...

01:29:19.540 --> 01:29:22.920
Juan Obregón is gonna
be taken into custody.

01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:27.720
But you must understand that
it's going to be a very difficult task...

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:31.510
because of the corruption
in the poIice force.

01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:34.930
Hopefully, the exchange
of training methods and information...

01:29:34.930 --> 01:29:37.310
between our two countries will help.

01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:39.600
l hope so.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:43.560
On another note, General,
we were taIking about supply.

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:46.440
What about demand?

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:49.530
What are your policies
towards treatment of addiction?

01:29:49.530 --> 01:29:52.780
"Treatment of addiction."

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:55.120
Addicts treat themselves.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:59.920
They overdose, and then there's
one less to worry about.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:09.760
<i>What l want you to do</i>
<i>right now is write down five triggers...</i>

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.970
that couId lead to your reIapse...

01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:14.470
that could jeopardize your recovery.

01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:17.850
Five triggers.
Your parents, something like that.

01:30:17.850 --> 01:30:19.470
Something they could say.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.310
Anything that's a trigger for you.
lt varies from person to person.

01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:25.810
l know some of us
have already discussed it.

01:30:25.820 --> 01:30:28.690
l know, Linda,
we talked about it the other day.

01:30:28.690 --> 01:30:31.150
l know you have trouble
with your sister...

01:30:31.150 --> 01:30:35.730
how she's always
kind of outshining you.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:46.670
<i>Sugar foot,</i>
<i>how do you like your new home?</i>

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:53.680
You got to be kidding me.
This is not what my lawyers negotiated.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:55.680
Please. Fuck your lawyers.

01:30:55.680 --> 01:30:58.510
You're not getting
any goddamn cappuccino or -

01:30:58.510 --> 01:30:59.930
- Biscotti?
- Biscotti. Yeah.

01:30:59.930 --> 01:31:02.180
You ain't getting
none of that shit either. Pick a bed.

01:31:02.190 --> 01:31:05.730
Stay off the phone, Eddie.
No long-distance calls, all right?

01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:08.940
Use 1 -800-CRlMlNAL if you do.

01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:20.160
<i>Mr. Ayala first came</i>
<i>to see me in January.</i>

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:23.370
That would have been 1987.

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:26.830
He wanted to rent warehouse space
along the harbor.

01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:31.050
I didn't ask too many questions.
l am a businessman also.

01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:35.720
l was the company's secretary
from 1991 to 1994.

01:31:35.720 --> 01:31:40.060
l supposedly worked for all
six companies, but they weren't -

01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:44.390
l mean, it was just an empty office
with a desk and a telephone.

01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:47.440
l never sold anything
the whole time l was there.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.860
Sometimes people came in,
and they got paid.

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:53.740
l-l don't really know
what they did.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:57.660
Didn't Mr. Ayala
say where the money came from?

01:31:57.660 --> 01:31:59.370
No.

01:31:59.370 --> 01:32:02.540
Did you ask where the money came from?

01:32:02.540 --> 01:32:04.580
No.

01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.910
Where do you think it came from?

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.420
- Objection. Speculation.
- Sustained.

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.920
I'll rephrase, Your Honor.

01:32:10.920 --> 01:32:15.720
Did you feel like you were engaged
in a legitimate enterprise?

01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:21.270
No, not really.

01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.740
Thank you.

01:32:52.130 --> 01:32:54.960
You were followed by the police...

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:59.760
but they won't be able
to hear us over the children.

01:33:03.140 --> 01:33:05.850
l want to use a bomb.

01:33:08.730 --> 01:33:10.810
Are you kidding?

01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:14.110
Can't you just shoot him or something?

01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:17.490
I don't really like guns.

01:33:17.490 --> 01:33:19.990
You shoot somebody in the head
two, three times...

01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:24.790
and some pinche doctor
is trying to keep him alive.

01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:29.830
When are you gonna do it?

01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:32.140
l don't know.

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:39.090
Eduardo Ruiz is the only
real witness against Carl.

01:33:39.090 --> 01:33:41.400
Security will be very tight.

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:48.150
- l may not be abIe to get to him.
- You'll be able to get to him.

01:33:48.770 --> 01:33:52.520
lf they can get to the pope and the president,
you can certainly get to him.

01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:59.320
Careful. You're starting to sound
like your husband, Mrs. Ayala.

01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:23.070
Nobody saw her leave?

01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.720
No, l understand.

01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:30.350
Okay.

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:36.900
l gotta go.

01:34:36.900 --> 01:34:38.900
l've got to go home.

01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:42.900
Did you want me to resch - Um -

01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:44.730
Fine.

01:35:34.620 --> 01:35:36.940
Javier.

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:56.970
No.

01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:31.490
What you want? Pot? Rock?
What you want?

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:22.730
Fuck!

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:42.180
What the fuck do you want, man?

01:38:10.450 --> 01:38:12.760
Yeah.

01:40:27.170 --> 01:40:30.750
lt has come to our attention that
Your Honor, while in private practice...

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:33.090
previousIy represented
the town of Seal Beach...

01:40:33.090 --> 01:40:36.090
in their stop-work suit against
the police department of Seal Beach.

01:40:36.090 --> 01:40:38.760
We believe this disqualifies you
from hearing this case...

01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:41.970
and we, therefore, move for a temporary
suspension until it's investigated.

01:40:41.970 --> 01:40:45.100
Mr. Adler,
this is a most unusual motion.

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.100
Nonetheless, Your Honor...

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:50.440
we feel our client deserves
every fairness afforded under the law.

01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:55.240
l hope this is not in any way designed
to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz.

01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:02.910
We will recess until 9:00 a.m.
on Monday morning...

01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:07.710
and l will see counsel
in my chambers.

01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.490
They are coming this way.

01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:35.470
They are passing me now.

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.910
Boy, there's a lot of them.

01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:48.630
Listen, would you mind if we
walked back to the hoteI today?

01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:51.950
- Walk back?
- Yeah.

01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:58.160
They're not getting into the car.

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.630
What are they doing?

01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:04.340
They're arguing or something.

01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:09.180
lt's two blocks.
l could use the fresh air.

01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:11.770
l've been stuck in that piece of shit
hotel room for two weeks.

01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:14.480
I don't give a fuck.
Let's just stop standing around.

01:42:14.480 --> 01:42:16.690
- l want to walk 'cause l want to walk, not 'cause he wants to walk.
- Let's walk.

01:42:16.690 --> 01:42:19.050
l like that.
Okay, we'll walk.

01:42:21.610 --> 01:42:24.270
They're going past me.

01:42:27.540 --> 01:42:32.170
l-I-l do not know. l think
they're going back to the courthouse.

01:42:32.170 --> 01:42:36.970
This could be the Iast chance to do this!
Get out of the car and shoot him in the head!

01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.400
<i>You're a fucking big man?</i>

01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:03.200
l'm a real fucking man. l don't fucking
deal drugs to Iittle fucking kids, you -

01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.620
- You think you're a badass?
- l am a badass!

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:17.670
Move, move! Get down!

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:25.220
- We need an ambuIance!
- l got it!

01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:28.570
- Go, go, go! We need an ambulance.
- Go, go, go.

01:43:56.790 --> 01:44:00.140
Ray. Ray! Ray!
Wait a minute, Ray!

01:44:46.840 --> 01:44:49.750
Manolito, Manolito, Manolito.

01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:26.850
Sorry about the other night.

01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:30.510
Me too.

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:43.300
Thank you for coming down here, though l
suspect it has been a pointless journey.

01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:48.430
- Why would you say that?
- Bueno, pues, l hear these stories.

01:51:48.430 --> 01:51:51.810
Your husband in jail,
his business in chaos...

01:51:51.810 --> 01:51:54.270
various people fighting over the scraps.

01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:58.940
My husband was a victim of an informer
in your organization, not in ours.

01:51:58.940 --> 01:52:01.650
That is not true, Mrs. Ayala.

01:52:01.650 --> 01:52:04.570
Your route has been compromised.

01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:08.070
Perhaps it is time for me to deal
with other distributors in California.

01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:10.330
- l don't think you're gonna do that.
- You don't?

01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:13.200
No.

01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:18.000
My husband was working on something
he calIed the Project for the Children.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.800
- Are you aware of this?
- l don't know. Perhaps I remember something.

01:52:27.340 --> 01:52:32.010
lf you want to smuggle narcotics
<i>in Senor Espastico Jacobo...</i>

01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:34.350
that is nothing new, Senora.

01:52:34.350 --> 01:52:38.190
No, not in.
The doll is cocaine.

01:52:38.190 --> 01:52:42.860
High impact, pressure-molded cocaine.

01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:47.200
lt's odorless, undetectable by the dogs.

01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:50.350
Undetectable by anyone.

01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:52.800
l don't believe you, senora.

01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:19.480
l'm six months pregnant.

01:53:19.480 --> 01:53:21.790
l won't do it.

01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:25.280
- Then we don't have a deal.
- Yeah, right.

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:27.740
We don't have a deal.

01:53:28.530 --> 01:53:32.660
Sorry to waste your time,
Mr. Obregón.

01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:35.580
Okay.

01:53:35.580 --> 01:53:37.890
Okay, okay.

01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:50.700
- That's good coke.
- lt should be. lt's yours.

01:53:52.010 --> 01:53:54.010
l want our debt forgiven...

01:53:54.010 --> 01:53:58.600
l want to be the exclusive distributor of
Obregón brothers' cocaine in the United States...

01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:03.400
and l want the principal witness against
my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.

01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:13.860
Have you told the complete truth
during this interview?

01:54:15.450 --> 01:54:17.420
Yes.

01:54:19.370 --> 01:54:22.170
- AIex?
- Solid.

01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:24.630
- That's good shit, Javier.
- You know, Javier...

01:54:24.630 --> 01:54:27.300
they dump those cell phones
every 24 hours.

01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:30.970
Yes, but l have
a contact at MexTel...

01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:34.340
who can get me
his new E.S.N. in 12 hours.

01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:36.660
That's good to know.

01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:44.310
So, now that you have
what you want...

01:54:44.310 --> 01:54:47.650
let's talk about how
l get what l want.

01:54:47.650 --> 01:54:49.990
You don't have
to worry about that.

01:54:49.990 --> 01:54:52.820
You're not gonna have
any problems there.

01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:57.330
Yeah, but first let's talk about what precautions
you're taking to protect yourself.

01:54:57.330 --> 01:55:01.370
You worry about getting me
what l want.

01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:04.230
l'll worry about myself.

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:13.260
<i>Oye, Javier,</i>
you should feel good about this.

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:19.080
l feel like a traitor.

01:56:44.770 --> 01:56:49.100
Helena Ayala just left Club Platinum,
the Obregón brothers' place in Tijuana.

01:56:49.110 --> 01:56:51.270
- Yeah?
- She got stopped at the border.

01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:55.780
She was clean,
and she's back in San Diego now.

01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:58.090
Okay.

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.790
- HelIo?
<i>- Robert, it's Jeff Sheridan.</i>

01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:14.130
<i>- D-Did I wake you? l'm sorry.</i>
- No, it's okay.

01:57:14.130 --> 01:57:16.300
<i>General SaIazar has been arrested.</i>

01:57:16.300 --> 01:57:18.800
<i>It turns out he has been working</i>
<i>for Porfirio MadrigaI...</i>

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:20.970
<i>and the Juarez cartel</i>
<i>the entire time.</i>

01:57:20.970 --> 01:57:24.310
<i>That is why he was trying to push</i>
<i>the Obregóns out of Tijuana...</i>

01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:26.640
<i>- so he and Madrigal could move in.</i>
- What?

01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:29.770
l thought Madrigal was dead.
l thought that had been verified.

01:57:29.770 --> 01:57:33.150
<i>ApparentIy not. lt is a shitstorm here...</i>

01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:37.320
<i>but the D.E.A. supplied the information</i>
<i>and was part of the sting.</i>

01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:40.820
<i>So maybe we can spin this a little.</i>
<i>But l don't know what to telI people.</i>

01:57:40.820 --> 01:57:44.160
<i>- So, when are you coming back?</i>
- l'll try to get there as soon as l can.

01:57:44.160 --> 01:57:46.500
<i>- Yeah, okay, but -</i>
- Robert.

01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:48.460
<i>Robert?</i>

01:57:49.710 --> 01:57:51.790
<i>Robert?</i>

01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:53.880
l gotta call you back.

01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.490
<i>Wh-What -</i>

01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:04.680
- My Leica's missing.
- She got the video camera too.

01:58:05.010 --> 01:58:08.180
At least we know she's still alive.
Where are you going?

01:58:08.180 --> 01:58:12.350
Pawn shops open in an hour. Ten minutes
after that, she'll be at her dealer.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:16.640
lf l can find him,
l shouId be able to find her.

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:29.870
Although
ser and estar both mean "to be"...

01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:33.880
they have very specific uses.

01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:36.290
May l help you, sir?

01:58:41.050 --> 01:58:42.680
- Come on.
- Excuse me!

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:47.480
Seth has to be excused.
He's going on a field trip.

01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:57.540
l can't believe you brought
my daughter to this place.

01:58:58.570 --> 01:59:03.370
Whoa, whoa. Why don't you just
back the fuck up, man?

01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:06.030
"To this place"?

01:59:06.030 --> 01:59:08.200
What is that shit?

01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:10.910
Okay, right now, all over
this great nation of ours...

01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:13.750
100,000 white people from the suburbs
are cruising around downtown...

01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:17.630
asking every bIack person, "You got any drugs?
You know where I can score some drugs?"

01:59:17.630 --> 01:59:21.590
Think about the effect that has on the psyche
of a black person, on their possibilities.

01:59:21.590 --> 01:59:25.760
l - God, l guarantee you, you bring 100,000
black peopIe into your neighborhood...

01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:30.100
and they're asking every white person they see,
"You got any drugs? Know where l can score some?"

01:59:30.100 --> 01:59:34.480
Within a day, everyone would be selling -
your friends, their kids.

01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:38.270
Here's why: lt's an unbeatable market force, man.
lt's a 300% markup value.

01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:41.230
You can go out on the street
and make $500 in two hours...

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:43.280
come back and do whatever you want
with the rest of your day.

01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:48.080
You're telIing me that white people
would stilI be going to law school?

02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:15.980
- What do you want?
- l'm looking for my daughter.

02:00:15.980 --> 02:00:17.940
Caroline.

02:00:17.940 --> 02:00:20.480
She's been here.

02:00:20.480 --> 02:00:22.650
This is a business, man.
Why don't you get the fuck out of here?

02:00:22.650 --> 02:00:27.330
l need to find my daughter, all right?
I'Il pay you.

02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:31.540
All right.
Okay. Hold on.

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:38.380
Who in the fuck do you think you are?
Where the fuck do you think you are?

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:42.300
Why the fuck shouldn't l just
put your ass in a Dumpster?

02:00:42.300 --> 02:00:44.590
- l got money.
- I got money!

02:00:44.590 --> 02:00:47.430
l got $1,000 in my wallet.
lt's for you.

02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:50.390
lf l want your money, man,
l will take your money.

02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:55.180
Just tell me where my daughter is.

02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:58.190
Please? Please?

02:01:03.690 --> 02:01:06.050
Don't do that shit again.

02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:16.670
Look, Jesus, man, l'm telling you,
just don't do this vigilante thing. Okay?

02:01:16.710 --> 02:01:19.880
Either the cops are gonna find her,
or she's gonna calI you.

02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.420
Okay? l promise.

02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.560
Ana.

02:03:47.730 --> 02:03:50.980
l know she's in there.
Just Iet me talk to her.

02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:53.860
Look, l - l know she's in there, man!

02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:56.960
No, l fucking know she's in there!

02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:02.110
Jesus Christ!

02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:05.600
l-l haven't touched her.

02:04:11.710 --> 02:04:15.110
You get the fuck
out of here right now.

02:04:27.150 --> 02:04:28.770
Hi.

02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:38.440
Hi, Daddy.

02:04:41.120 --> 02:04:43.410
Hi, sweetheart.

02:05:16.780 --> 02:05:20.120
Good morning, Eddie.

02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.630
- Good morning.
- Big day.

02:05:23.620 --> 02:05:28.290
You're a star.

02:05:28.290 --> 02:05:30.830
Why don't you go take a shower, man?
You smell.

02:05:32.800 --> 02:05:36.590
- Who is it?
- lt's the Mafia.

02:05:36.590 --> 02:05:40.580
- l've got his breakfast.
- Coming.

02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:46.250
- So who's this going to?
- Over here.

02:05:53.320 --> 02:05:55.440
- Ooh.
- Fuck off.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:59.490
- ReIax, Eddie.
- Yeah, where has the love gone, man?

02:05:59.490 --> 02:06:00.920
Good-bye.

02:06:02.490 --> 02:06:04.660
You know, you're gonna be testifying
for about 10 days.

02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:07.000
We could just decide
to stop feeding your ass.

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:11.000
You expect me to be grateful for spending
the rest of my life looking over my shoulder?

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:15.480
Wow, that's -
that's heavy, Eddie.

02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:21.340
Can't you for one second imagine that none of this
had happened, that my drugs had gone through?

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:23.340
What would be the harm?

02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:25.680
What would be the harm?

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:28.520
A few peopIe get high
who are getting high anyway.

02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:31.170
Your partner's stiIl alive.

02:06:33.150 --> 02:06:35.190
We don't have to have
breakfast together.

02:06:35.190 --> 02:06:37.400
Don't you see this means nothing?

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.060
Your whole life is pointless.

02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:43.770
You're really breaking my heart, man.

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:49.430
- The worst part about you, Monty -
- "Monty"?

02:06:51.250 --> 02:06:52.870
The worst part about you, Monty...

02:06:52.880 --> 02:06:56.340
is you realize the futility of what
you're doing, and you do it anyway.

02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:59.210
Wish you could see
how transparent you are.

02:06:59.220 --> 02:07:01.470
This food tastes like shit.

02:07:01.470 --> 02:07:06.040
So, take your stank ass
and go get a shower already.

02:07:08.350 --> 02:07:09.680
Let me tell you something.

02:07:09.680 --> 02:07:12.430
You onIy got to me because you
were tipped off by the Juarez cartel...

02:07:12.430 --> 02:07:14.440
who's trying to break into Tijuana.

02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:17.730
You are helping them.

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:21.420
So, remember, you work
for a drug dealer too, Monty.

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:24.240
Fuck me.

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:27.780
- Who is it?
- Breakfast.

02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:32.050
Hurry up.
lt's getting cold.

02:07:36.380 --> 02:07:38.740
Okay. One second.

02:07:39.590 --> 02:07:42.260
Get the fuck down!

02:07:42.260 --> 02:07:45.930
- Get down! Get the fuck down!
- L'm on your side!

02:07:45.930 --> 02:07:49.080
- What the fuck?
- Shit. Call an ambulance.

02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:52.370
- Call an ambulance! Fuck!
- Palms up. Spread your damn hands out.

02:07:52.370 --> 02:07:56.060
Shit! Eddie!

02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:00.070
Hold on.

02:08:00.070 --> 02:08:03.360
Shit!
Hurry up with that ambulance!

02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.560
Shit. Hold on. Hold on.

02:08:08.780 --> 02:08:12.660
Your Honor,
ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:16.620
because of the sudden death
of Eduardo Ruiz...

02:08:16.630 --> 02:08:21.430
the people have determined that we cannot
continue our case against Carl Ayala.

02:08:28.930 --> 02:08:31.680
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.

02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:19.210
Yeah?

02:10:19.210 --> 02:10:21.570
Hi.

02:10:22.290 --> 02:10:25.750
So, I got a copy of your speech.

02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:28.590
lt's fantastic.

02:10:28.590 --> 02:10:31.260
So, Robert, my genuine thanks.

02:10:31.260 --> 02:10:33.410
You're my choice.
You're gonna be great.

02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:36.730
The president's sorry he hasn't been
able to spend more time with you.

02:10:36.730 --> 02:10:40.100
After the press conference,
he wants to realIy sit down.

02:10:40.100 --> 02:10:43.740
And l got to the Post too.

02:10:44.140 --> 02:10:47.280
Don't worry about that thing
with your daughter. lt's not news.

02:10:47.280 --> 02:10:51.650
They're willing to treat it
as a family matter, personal matter.

02:10:51.660 --> 02:10:55.620
Anyway, if it came out,
we couId turn it into a quaIification.

02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:57.790
"l've been in the trenches
of the drug war.

02:10:57.790 --> 02:11:00.790
l've seen the face of the enemy."
Et cetera, et cetera.

02:11:00.790 --> 02:11:05.590
<i>A sterling reputation</i>
<i>and close friend of the president...</i>

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:09.460
recently confirmed into the Office
of National Drug Control Policy...

02:11:09.470 --> 02:11:14.270
our new drug czar,
Robert Hudson Wakefield.

02:11:24.650 --> 02:11:28.320
The war on drugs is a war
that we have to win...

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:32.010
and a war that we can win.

02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:37.250
We have to win this war to save
our country's most precious resource -

02:11:37.870 --> 02:11:40.520
our children.

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:44.670
Sixty-eight miIlion children
have been targeted...

02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:48.360
by those who perpetrate this war...

02:11:49.170 --> 02:11:53.970
and protecting these children
must be priority number one.

02:11:57.850 --> 02:12:02.650
There has been progress,
and there has been failure.

02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:07.500
But where we have fallen short...

02:12:08.110 --> 02:12:11.150
l see not a problem...

02:12:11.150 --> 02:12:13.760
l see an opportunity.

02:12:17.700 --> 02:12:19.620
An opportunity...

02:12:21.250 --> 02:12:23.610
to correct the mistakes...

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:26.870
of the past...

02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:31.770
while Iaying a foundation
for the future.

02:12:36.720 --> 02:12:39.220
This takes...

02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:43.060
not only new ideas...

02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.570
but perseverance.

02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:49.100
This takes not only...

02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:52.230
resources, but courage.

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:54.030
This takes...

02:12:54.030 --> 02:12:57.360
not only... government...

02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:59.730
but families.

02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:04.420
l've laid out a te-

02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:12.090
l have laid out a 10-point plan that -

02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:28.800
l can't do this.

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:35.940
lf there is a war on drugs...

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:40.740
then many of our famiIy members
are the enemy.

02:13:43.450 --> 02:13:48.250
And l don't know how you wage war
on your own family.

02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:35.130
National Airport, please.

02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:24.050
Arnie, it's Saturday.
You're working too hard, my friend.

02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:27.390
Carl, l'm running late.
l'm coming right over.

02:15:27.390 --> 02:15:32.190
No, no, no, don't bother, Arnie.
Let me ask you something.

02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:35.400
When were you gonna tell me
about the $3 million...

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:40.200
we got in from San Francisco
two days after l was arrested?

02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:44.070
Um... l was waiting
for the right time.

02:15:44.070 --> 02:15:47.450
You didn't think you could
trust my wife with that information?

02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:49.580
l didn't want to risk it.

02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:52.250
That could have been frozen
along with everything else.

02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:54.580
You had it all figured out,
didn't you?

02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:56.580
You were gonna move into my house...

02:15:56.590 --> 02:16:00.250
raise my kids, sleep in my bed...

02:16:00.260 --> 02:16:02.590
with my wife.

02:16:02.590 --> 02:16:04.970
Sounds like a nice plan.

02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:06.950
Is it insane?

02:16:06.950 --> 02:16:09.660
Just think about it, okay?
lf l was gonna rip you off...

02:16:09.670 --> 02:16:12.300
why wouldn't l just leave town
after Ruiz was killed?

02:16:12.300 --> 02:16:15.390
Why would l sit next to you in court
and listen to a dismissal?

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:19.770
Let me ask you something. You think there's
a difference between a reason and an excuse?

02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:22.440
'Cause l don't.

02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:25.860
- Good-bye, Arnie.
- Carl -

02:16:25.860 --> 02:16:28.280
Carl?

02:16:36.750 --> 02:16:40.830
Come on, sweetheart. Come outside.
Everyone's waiting for you.

02:16:41.250 --> 02:16:43.629
- Who was that?
- Arnie. He's,

02:16:43.629 --> 02:16:45.969
He can't make it to the barbecue.

02:16:45.969 --> 02:16:49.070
- Come on.
- Hi, Helena.

02:16:50.459 --> 02:16:52.320
<i>- HelIo.</i>
- lt's a great party.

02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:54.740
- Who is he, a friend of yours?
- L'm a nobody.

02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:57.309
l'm the nobody who arrested you.

02:16:57.309 --> 02:16:59.610
- You're -
- How you doing?

02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:02.520
- What are you doing in my house?
- Just looking around.

02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:05.820
You got nice shit.
Drug money buys a lot of nice shit, Carl.

02:17:05.820 --> 02:17:08.280
Listen, you don't want to talk that way
in my house.

02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.430
Do you know
you're fucking a murderer, Carl?

02:17:10.430 --> 02:17:13.240
- Fuck you and fuck your wife.
- You can't be in here.

02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:16.500
- Get him out.
- You put me out, Carl.

02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:18.620
- I'm a cop.
- l don't care.

02:17:18.629 --> 02:17:22.559
Get out.

02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.629
Shit.

02:17:28.639 --> 02:17:32.680
- ls that what you wanted?
- A nice little bedtime story, Helena.

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:34.790
Tell him how you murdered
my partner!

02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:37.520
- You got the wrong -
- His name was Ray Castro, Helena!

02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:40.860
Ray Castro!
You remember that!

02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:43.190
- What's his problem?
- The carpet, sweetheart.

02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:45.500
- No, no, no, l got it.
- l got it.

02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.709
- Where did he come from?
- Outside, honey.

02:17:57.040 --> 02:17:59.350
What do you want to do, man?

02:18:28.570 --> 02:18:32.620
<i>On the good days, l feel like l get it.</i>

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:36.309
Like it all makes sense.

02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:39.040
l can stay in the moment.

02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:43.840
l don't have to control
everything in the future...

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.719
and l believe everything
is gonna work out fine.

02:18:53.299 --> 02:18:55.219
O-On the bad days...

02:18:56.600 --> 02:19:00.490
I just want to grab the phone
and start diaIing numbers.

02:19:01.559 --> 02:19:04.770
l want to pull my hair...

02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:09.049
and run through
the streets screaming.

02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:17.680
But thanks to the people
l've met in these rooms...

02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:22.719
like Margaret and Jim...

02:19:23.459 --> 02:19:25.180
and Sarah...

02:19:28.959 --> 02:19:31.129
l'm pretty sure
l'm gonna make it...

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:33.299
through today.

02:19:44.650 --> 02:19:47.750
Would you like to share?

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:52.150
my name is Robert...

02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:55.360
and my wife Barbara and l...

02:19:55.370 --> 02:19:58.560
are here to support
our daughter, Caroline...

02:19:59.620 --> 02:20:02.570
and we're hear to listen.
