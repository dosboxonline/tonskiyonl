WEBVTT

00:29.404 --> 00:30.822
-Morning, Coach. -Morning, Coach.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.073
You wanna grab some breakfast?

00:32.156 --> 00:34.368
Nah, I just had one piece of cereal and I'm pretty stuffed.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.786
Could go for coffee though.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.287
Yeah.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.082
You know what today feels like?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.835
-First day of school. -First day of school. That's right.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.753
That's close.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.841
-What about you, Coach? How you feeling? -A little nervous.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.385
Well, heck, yeah. No such thing as "last-day jitters."

00:54.304 --> 00:55.305
Gotta look right, Coach.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.558
Yeah. I'm gonna get that someday.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.561
So blues

01:00.644 --> 01:02.729
-I can tell you -Check out my man here.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.441
So blues, I can tell you

01:17.828 --> 01:19.580
A girl's not gettin' by me.

01:23.375 --> 01:27.129
Sometimes the best way to stick it to the man is go right between his legs, huh?

01:27.212 --> 01:28.964
-We gotta go, Coach. -Yeah.

01:37.723 --> 01:38.891
Knock-a-doodle-do.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.102
-Good morning, Coach Lasso. -Hey, look at us.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.146
Couple of worm-addicted early birds, am I right?

01:44.980 --> 01:47.399
Well, I'm glad I caught ya. I brought you a little something.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.234
Yeah. Cookies.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.612
Or as y'all call 'em here, biscuits, right?

01:51.695 --> 01:55.449
Though, I do not recommend you smother these in gravy.

01:55.532 --> 01:56.825
Ted, I don't really--

01:56.909 --> 01:59.119
Come on now. Take a lookie there.

01:59.203 --> 02:01.079
-Those do look good. -Right?

02:01.163 --> 02:02.247
Go ahead, take a nibble.

02:02.331 --> 02:05.125
That's it. Away you go.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.253
Fuck me.

02:10.172 --> 02:11.590
Where did you get these?

02:11.673 --> 02:12.966
I'm glad you like 'em.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.052
You know what? I'll start bringing these to ya every morning.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.345
Call it "Biscuits with the Boss."

02:16.428 --> 02:18.430
That really isn't necessary.

02:18.514 --> 02:21.225
Okay, well, mark this down as the first time we disagree then.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.810
Actually, no, second time. Tea is horrible.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.855
Absolute garbage water. I don't know why y'all do that.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.982
Anyhoo, you know, we can't really be good partners

02:29.066 --> 02:30.943
-unless we get to know each other, right? -Ted--

02:31.026 --> 02:32.861
We're gonna start simple. Real easy, real easy one.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.905
We're gonna do first concert, best concert.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.074
You go ahead and go first. Go. Right off the bat. Come on.

02:37.157 --> 02:40.118
The Spice Girls. And... the Spice Girls.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.497
Same answer for both? I love that. My turn. First concert.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.416
I mean, come on. It was "The Gambler" himself, Mr. Kenny Rogers.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.836
Okay, I'm sorry--

02:48.919 --> 02:49.920
Ted--

02:53.048 --> 02:54.258
Coach Lasso.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.221
Stop. Ted, I'm sorry.

02:59.304 --> 03:03.725
"Biscuits with the Boss" is not something that I have time for this morning.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.561
Or ever.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.939
-I hear ya, boss. Loud and clear. -There we go.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.190
Okay.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.109
You're gonna show up tomorrow with biscuits, aren't you?

03:12.192 --> 03:14.278
Come on now. I would not bet on that.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.155
I mean, unless you wanna win a buttload of money.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.032
High five, tree.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.820
Remember what you said to me our first day coaching at Wichita State?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.238
Lose the ponytail?

03:58.322 --> 04:00.324
Relax. They're just kids.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.704
Well, these fellas sure as heck ain't kids.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.291
Hey, look at Isaac. He looks like a Rodin sculpture in cleats.

04:10.542 --> 04:11.793
Boots.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.170
They call cleats "boots."

04:14.213 --> 04:16.298
I thought you said that the trunk of a car was a boot.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.632
Also a boot.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.927
Hold on now. If I were to get fired from my job

04:20.010 --> 04:21.845
where I'm puttin' cleats in the trunk of my car--

04:21.928 --> 04:24.056
You got the boot from puttin' boots in the boot.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.557
I love that.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.062
All right, gentlemen. Let's go ahead and do a little seven on seven.

04:30.145 --> 04:32.314
We're gonna call this drill "The Exorcist"

04:32.397 --> 04:34.483
'cause it's all about controlling possession.

04:35.734 --> 04:36.735
All right, let's go!

04:42.616 --> 04:43.700
Fuck!

04:49.414 --> 04:53.627
Someone get some flowers, 'cause this spot here is where Sam died.

04:55.838 --> 04:57.297
It's very sad.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.550
Oi. Walk away, you little prick.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.677
All right, granddad. Keep your wig on.

05:03.512 --> 05:05.097
-Thanks, Roy. -Yeah, you're good.

05:05.180 --> 05:06.265
Hey, Sam, come here a sec.

05:08.767 --> 05:09.768
Coach, I'm sorry.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.854
You know what the happiest animal on earth is?

05:12.938 --> 05:14.690
It's a goldfish.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.024
You know why?

05:16.817 --> 05:19.194
-No. -Got a ten-second memory.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.447
Be a goldfish, Sam. Yeah?

05:28.579 --> 05:29.830
Yeah, you got it. Go ahead.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.210
-Hey, Nate. -Who, me?

05:35.294 --> 05:37.004
Yeah. Until we get another Nate here,

05:37.087 --> 05:39.464
I just need you to assume you're my default Nate, okay?

05:39.548 --> 05:41.842
Come on, question for ya. What's the buzz on Sam here?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.177
Seems a little down in the dumps.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.639
Yeah, he's been underachieving since he got here from Nigeria, so...

05:47.723 --> 05:50.475
Yeah, well, first time away from home is never easy.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.936
We're gonna have to do something to Ni-cheer-ia him up, man.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.025
You still laughing at stuff you don't think is funny, huh?

05:58.108 --> 06:00.110
I'm not always sure what's a joke and what isn't.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.029
Yeah, it's tough to tell these days, isn't it?

06:02.112 --> 06:03.947
Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go!

06:04.031 --> 06:08.076
Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go! Go, Lasso! Go, Lasso, go!

06:08.702 --> 06:09.912
Higgins.

06:09.995 --> 06:12.122
Ted Lasso was in my office.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.958
"What's the first concert you ever saw?"

06:15.042 --> 06:17.961
-Boy George. -Not you, you garden gnome.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.546
He wants us to get together every morning

06:19.630 --> 06:21.381
to get to know me and hear what I've got to say.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.508
The nerve!

06:22.591 --> 06:25.260
I mean, the man's just relentless and nice.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.554
Everywhere he's been, his players seem to love him.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.640
It's the one thing that could just muck this up.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.183
Hello, boys.

06:31.892 --> 06:32.893
Up top.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.730
-Hello, Miss Welton. -Hello, Miss Welton.

06:39.775 --> 06:43.987
Higgins, do you know which of the players has the most sway in the locker room?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.031
No.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.994
So helpful. Then solve me this different mystery.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.121
Find out where Lasso got those biscuits.

06:54.164 --> 06:56.375
Watch out, biscuits! Higgins is on the case.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.716
All right, fellas. Excuse me.

07:04.800 --> 07:05.884
Listen up!

07:07.302 --> 07:08.846
Thank you, Coach.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.223
Now, we got Crystal Palace coming here on Saturday.

07:11.306 --> 07:12.474
Anything we need to know, Coach?

07:12.558 --> 07:15.477
-Lot of speed on the outside. -Okay. Anything else?

07:15.561 --> 07:17.062
Lot of speed.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.355
Okay, you heard the man.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.691
Y'all whipped 'em up pretty good earlier this year,

07:20.774 --> 07:23.652
so me and Coach ain't gonna mess with the game plan.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.237
But...

07:25.320 --> 07:28.115
we would like to start fiddling with the way we do things in the locker room.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.242
And if the Internet has taught us anything,

07:30.325 --> 07:34.079
it's that sometimes it's easier to speak our minds anonymously.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.457
Right? So I asked Nate here to make us a good old-fashioned suggestion box.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.126
Hey, look at that.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.171
Yeah, did it with my niece. She loves crafts, so--

07:42.254 --> 07:44.256
Yeah. I love glimpses into your personal life.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.340
This is lovely.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.801
So, if anything's got y'all hot and bothered,

07:47.885 --> 07:49.303
just go ahead and drop us a note.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.890
You could have issue with the color of the towels

07:52.973 --> 07:55.184
or, heck, the food in the vending machine.

07:55.267 --> 07:56.268
Sound good?

07:58.353 --> 08:00.772
Okay, great. See y'all tomorrow.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.651
Oi. We're middle of the table, we've lost three of four,

08:04.735 --> 08:07.988
and you wanna know if the snacks in the locker room are tasty enough?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.281
Are they?

08:09.990 --> 08:10.991
Jesus Christ.

08:13.285 --> 08:14.286
They are not.

08:30.886 --> 08:32.638
That's a long time to wait, Ted.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.807
Well, I respect you didn't hurry.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.393
So, how was your first official day?

08:38.477 --> 08:39.477
I'm not entirely sure

08:39.561 --> 08:42.063
what y'all's smallest unit of measurement is over here,

08:42.147 --> 08:44.358
but that's about how much headway I made.

08:44.441 --> 08:46.527
And yet, you seem undeterred.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.074
Solid entrance.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.745
What would you rather be, a lion or a panda?

08:56.828 --> 08:58.121
I don't have time for this.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.123
Okay.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.708
-Ted? -Gotta go panda.

09:02.292 --> 09:06.505
Are you mad? Pandas are fat and lazy and have piss-stained fur.

09:06.588 --> 09:10.300
Lions are powerful and majestic and rule the jungle.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.553
Try telling that to an elephant. Can I be an elephant?

09:12.636 --> 09:13.679
Lion or panda.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.930
-Panda. -Lion!

09:15.013 --> 09:17.182
-What's black and white and red all over? -I don't know. What?

09:17.266 --> 09:21.186
A panda that gets anywhere near a fucking lion. The answer is lion.

09:22.646 --> 09:23.814
All right.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.275
That Rebecca is an intimidating, very tall woman.

09:26.358 --> 09:29.152
I mean, the minute she locked eyes with me, I started sweating.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.656
Oh, no. She got some fences, all right, but you just gotta hop over 'em.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.740
Hi, babe.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.870
Here. Keys.

09:37.953 --> 09:40.581
Hey, Jamie, what would you rather be? A lion or a panda?

09:41.373 --> 09:43.041
Coach, I'm me.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.543
Why would I wanna be anything else?

09:44.626 --> 09:47.880
I'm not sure you realize how psychologically healthy that actually is.

09:49.715 --> 09:50.716
Cheers.

09:51.675 --> 09:52.843
Night Court.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.178
Wow.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.888
-He's a lion. -Definitely lion.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.640
You know pandas eat their weight in bamboo? My little boy told me that.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.267
-No! -What are you talking about?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.810
Pandas are capable of it.

10:01.894 --> 10:03.854
I don't know how often they actually do that.

10:05.564 --> 10:07.691
Sam's down in every stat since Nigeria.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.568
Maybe the Premiership's too much for him.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.987
No, he just needs to get a little more comfy here, that's all.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.199
-He turns 20 on Saturday. -There we go. A birthday.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.617
We'll do something special for him.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.952
Nudge that ship in the right direction, yeah?

10:19.036 --> 10:20.037
Hey.

10:24.583 --> 10:25.792
Let's see what we got here.

10:25.876 --> 10:26.877
"Wanker."

10:27.669 --> 10:30.881
Let's see what else we got. "Piss off, wanker."

10:33.258 --> 10:34.718
"I hope you choke on a Big Mac."

10:34.801 --> 10:37.304
-Good thing these are anonymous. -No, Roy signed that one.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.388
-Roy. -Here's a good one.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.391
"Shower pressure is rubbish." Make a note of that.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.103
"Wanker." Yep.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.981
I'm not gonna say that word out loud.

10:48.857 --> 10:49.942
Another "wanker."

10:50.025 --> 10:52.945
You don't wanna let them call you a wanker, Ted. It's bad.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.363
What's a wanker?

10:56.365 --> 10:58.450
I'm a visual learner, so that's very helpful. Thank you.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.285
My pleasure.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.829
Okay, I got one.

11:03.539 --> 11:06.834
What if I joined forces with a swashbuckling cat

11:07.417 --> 11:10.212
to play tiny guitars for women of the night

11:10.295 --> 11:12.714
as we read Alex Haley's most seminal work?

11:12.798 --> 11:14.466
You'd be in cahoots with Puss in Boots,

11:14.550 --> 11:16.844
playing lutes for prostitutes, reading Roots.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.346
No, The Autobiography of Malcolm X. I gotcha.

11:19.429 --> 11:20.597
All right.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.392
Here we go. Hey, hold my beer.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.645
All right, see what you got, young lady. Come on. What you got? What you got?

11:27.145 --> 11:28.230
Are you kidding me?

11:29.481 --> 11:30.315
You see that?

11:30.399 --> 11:32.025
She spun you around like the Tasmanian Devil.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.653
Yeah, she did. Except without all that annoying...

11:42.035 --> 11:43.120
Wrong again.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.707
Why is this so hard for you, Higgins?

11:46.790 --> 11:48.417
What time is it?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.752
It's "Biscuits with the Boss" time!

11:51.670 --> 11:53.422
And Higgins! Hey.

11:53.964 --> 11:55.048
Three's a crowd.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.676
Hey, that's a crowd I don't mind being smack-dab in the middle of, buddy.

11:58.719 --> 12:01.013
Hey, boss. Check this out. Pow.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.723
Let's tie up some loose ends from yesterday.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.516
First concert, Kenny Rogers, right?

12:04.600 --> 12:07.728
Best concert, we got Beastie Boys at HORDE Fest, 1995.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.104
You're gonna love this story.

12:09.188 --> 12:11.023
Actually, did y'all get the O.J. trial over here?

12:11.106 --> 12:14.443
Ted, please. I can't just have you waltzing in here whenever you wish.

12:14.526 --> 12:16.987
What if I soft-shoe in, huh? Little something like that.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.530
Or I can moonwalk in.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.283
Despite recent headlines, it's still a fun dance move to do.

12:21.366 --> 12:24.077
-Ted, Ted. -You gotta see the way I see it, okay?

12:24.161 --> 12:26.705
Everybody in this building, part of the team. Part of AFC Richmond.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.248
Team's gotta bond. All right?

12:28.332 --> 12:30.125
I mean, heck, Higgins and I are having lunch today.

12:30.209 --> 12:32.377
Yes. We're having salads in my office.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.795
All right, catch you later, boss.

12:33.879 --> 12:35.631
Higgins, see you at lunch, huh?

12:35.714 --> 12:37.007
Caesar you later.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.387
Yes. Yes.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.725
He's intolerable.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.021
Boy. That is bad.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.398
Somebody ought to check this thing's prostate.

12:54.066 --> 12:54.900
Jeez.

12:56.818 --> 12:58.070
Yeah.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.072
Hey, Sam. You gotta pop upstairs real quick.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.990
Higgins wants to talk to you.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.492
Let's go. Move it, move it.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.871
Yep, yep. He's gone, he's gone.

13:07.955 --> 13:10.541
Shut the door, shut the door. Hey. Yo, hey, guys. Listen up, listen up.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.417
Okay, Sam's birthday is on Saturday.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.920
So I was thinking we'd all chip in and get him something nice.

13:15.003 --> 13:16.338
Nice gift or something. Right?

13:16.421 --> 13:19.508
So, Nate's gonna be coming around with yet another impressive box.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.426
Look at this. It's got a face!

13:21.510 --> 13:23.971
-He has a face. -Sorry, it-- He. He.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.139
-You put the money in his mouth. -Okay, you hear that, y'all?

13:26.223 --> 13:29.560
You put the money in his mouth. Got it? Okay, good.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.811
Go get 'em, Nate.

13:31.562 --> 13:32.563
Okay? Help him out.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.941
All right. Lovely. Thanks, Colin.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.780
You put the money in his mouth.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.284
Yummy for you.

13:48.287 --> 13:51.290
It's spearmint. Make the money smell nice.

13:51.373 --> 13:53.625
Thank you, Jamie. That's incredibly thoughtful.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.963
Hey, Jamie. Real quick.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.383
Just wanna have a chat. Did you put gum in the box there?

14:01.466 --> 14:03.385
-Yeah. Yeah. -Now, why'd you go and do that?

14:03.468 --> 14:05.554
-Sorry, Coach. -Nate's just trying to help us out here.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.140
-He's part of the team, right? -Yeah, right, Coach. Yeah, yeah.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.892
And I see this team like a band.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.811
-I love that. -And if we were the Rolling Stones,

14:13.395 --> 14:15.856
I'd be Mick Jagger, 'cause I'm the front man.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.149
-Sure. -I got the moves.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.234
Got a tiny waist, yeah. The whole bit. I get it.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.695
And Roy would be Keith Richards,

14:21.778 --> 14:24.072
'cause he's old and everyone's surprised he ain't dead yet.

14:24.156 --> 14:25.574
What the fuck are you saying?

14:25.657 --> 14:27.326
Roy, mate, if you're gonna go to the shower,

14:27.409 --> 14:29.536
you should take your sweater off first, pal.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.045
I'm just taking the piss, mate. Yeah.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.880
I'll be better. Promise.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.882
Glad to hear it. Yeah.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.140
Marcus, what you got?

14:50.224 --> 14:52.643
How are you feeling about taking on Crystal Palace this weekend?

14:52.726 --> 14:55.938
A palace made out of crystal seems mighty fragile if you ask me.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.106
-Coach. -Coach!

14:59.316 --> 15:01.401
-Yeah, right there. -Trent Crimm, The Independent.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.028
I remember, Trent.

15:03.111 --> 15:06.281
I'm just curious. Could you explain the offside rule?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.077
Well, Trent, I'm gonna put it the same way the US Supreme Court did

15:10.160 --> 15:13.247
back in 1964 when they defined pornography.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.499
It ain't easy to explain, but you know it when you see it.

15:17.251 --> 15:20.629
-Yeah, this gentleman right here. -Ernie Lounds, The Sun.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.922
Thank you.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.924
This question's for Ms. Mannion.

15:24.007 --> 15:27.219
-It's "Welton." -Of course. My apologies.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.721
Any thoughts on the newest Rupert girl?

15:30.389 --> 15:33.642
Well, Rupert and I are no longer together, so...

15:34.268 --> 15:37.646
He may consort with whatever model-actress, actress-model he pleases.

15:38.605 --> 15:42.025
No, the girl who came forward today is another one who was with Rupert

15:42.109 --> 15:43.110
while you were married.

15:44.236 --> 15:46.697
I mean, she says it started five years ago.

15:46.780 --> 15:50.325
And they kept it going until, well, still.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.123
Oh.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.252
And all this time I thought men couldn't multitask.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.006
I'm afraid that's all we have time for.

16:04.089 --> 16:05.465
Thank you so much.

16:05.549 --> 16:06.550
Coach!

16:13.765 --> 16:15.767
Hey. How are you?

16:15.851 --> 16:17.895
Just wanna make sure you're doing okay.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.563
You know, that was pretty rough back there.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.815
I expect nothing less from the press.

16:21.899 --> 16:22.900
Yeah.

16:23.775 --> 16:27.362
Sorry, did you need somebody to post that? Because that person's not me.

16:28.405 --> 16:31.491
No, come on. This is a care package from my little boy.

16:32.576 --> 16:35.329
Maybe something in here can help cheer you up, yeah?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.706
Got a small battalion of army men.

16:38.457 --> 16:39.750
Says here on the card that

16:39.833 --> 16:42.544
I'm supposed to set 'em up in my apartment to help keep me safe.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.883
-Homemade kazoo. -Excellent.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.469
Only got one of those though, so you can't have that.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.970
Hey now.

16:52.804 --> 16:53.805
Look at that right there.

16:53.889 --> 16:57.768
You know, this right here is some of the best barbecue sauce in Kansas City,

16:57.851 --> 17:00.687
which makes it some of the best barbecue sauce in the world.

17:02.773 --> 17:03.774
Yes!

17:03.857 --> 17:06.609
You got some kind of food or something that can teleport you back home,

17:06.693 --> 17:07.819
make you feel warm and fuzzy?

17:10.196 --> 17:11.198
No.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.327
-Will that be all, Ted? -No.

17:15.410 --> 17:19.039
No, actually, the whole reason I'm here is 'cause I'm having a little trouble

17:19.122 --> 17:21.290
figuring out Jamie Tartt's operating instructions,

17:21.375 --> 17:23.961
and I was just seeing if you happened to have any advice.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.671
Sorry, I'm afraid--

17:27.381 --> 17:29.716
Your eyes just lit up. You got an idea. What is it? Go on.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.927
I was just gonna say you should go and talk to Keeley.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.347
I mean, you two have an obvious rapport. If anyone knows Jamie, it's her.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.599
See, that's why you're the boss, right?

17:37.683 --> 17:39.893
That's good. Hey, tell you what I'm gonna do though.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.063
I'm gonna give you one of these stinkers. Let's see. Let's get you a good one.

17:43.146 --> 17:46.066
Okay, this right here is gonna be your first line of defense,

17:46.149 --> 17:48.861
in case that little turkey Ernie Lounds comes back around, huh?

17:48.944 --> 17:51.613
How about that? We'll aim him right at the door there for you.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.199
All right, thanks, boss. I appreciate you.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.998
Yes! You look beautiful. Just pet the lion.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.417
Exactly!

18:03.500 --> 18:05.627
I love it. Give me a growl, yeah.

18:07.337 --> 18:08.797
Sexy, yeah.

18:08.881 --> 18:12.342
Yeah. Beautiful. Yeah, all right.

18:12.426 --> 18:13.886
Let's set up for the next shot.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.637
-Hi. -Hey, how you doing?

18:15.721 --> 18:17.264
Yeah, I'm all right. How are you?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.850
Yeah, not bad. So, you went with the lion, huh?

18:19.933 --> 18:22.436
-Yeah. -I'm a little hurt, but it looks cool.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.188
I look insane.

18:24.897 --> 18:27.149
But I do think it's a better look than the panda.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.485
Oh, yeah.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.155
-Fuck, I'm famished. -Yeah?

18:33.238 --> 18:34.740
Most lions are.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.325
-Look. Let's get some food. -Okay.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.076
-You hungry? -Yeah, is it free?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.078
Gotta be pretty fun for you, yeah?

18:40.162 --> 18:41.330
Yeah. I'm getting paid a shit ton

18:41.413 --> 18:43.874
to get dressed up like an animal and sell caffeinated vodka.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.584
But I do get to go home with the paws.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.711
Well, there's the perks right there. Yeah.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.963
-Can I have a bite? -Yeah. There you go.

18:50.047 --> 18:51.965
-Thank you. -Careful. You're welcome.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.844
I know that you didn't just pop down to feed me.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.014
No, you're right. I wanted to ask you about Jamie.

18:59.598 --> 19:00.849
Yeah.

19:02.059 --> 19:03.727
What would you say motivates him?

19:04.770 --> 19:05.938
Blow jobs.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.399
Is there a second option?

19:11.360 --> 19:12.861
Go on, give us another bite.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.072
Hey. There you are.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.075
Now, look, I know the kid's gonna be a star.

19:18.784 --> 19:21.078
I was kinda hoping he'd, you know, warm up

19:21.161 --> 19:23.664
to the team building I'm trying to do here. That's all.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.625
Actually, he responds well to positive reinforcement.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.502
-That's my wheelhouse. -There you go, then.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.837
Okay. Bite.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.091
-Go on, give us one more bite. -Here you go.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.133
Yeah.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.303
-That was a big one. -Well, yep.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.680
You got some ketchup there.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.515
Looks like you devoured an antelope.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.891
-Help me. -Just be careful. Hold on.

19:42.975 --> 19:44.476
Yeah, I feel that. There's a lot of it.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.436
Yeah, it's a lot and I'm just--

19:47.479 --> 19:48.480
Richmond! Richmond!

19:48.564 --> 19:52.317
We are moments away from Crystal Palace facing AFC Richmond

19:52.401 --> 19:54.570
and their new manager, Ted Lasso.

19:54.653 --> 19:59.491
While on the pitch, all eyes will surely be on young phenom, Jamie Tartt.

19:59.575 --> 20:01.785
All right, fellas, here we go. Here we go.

20:01.869 --> 20:03.328
Coach, you got any last words?

20:03.412 --> 20:06.415
-Speed on the outside. -Speed on the outside. You heard the man.

20:06.498 --> 20:08.458
That's all we got for you, except for one thing.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.086
And that's Happy Birthday, Sam!

20:20.429 --> 20:22.681
Babatunde's the best.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.101
-Hey. -Hey, enjoy.

20:27.477 --> 20:29.396
Hey, man, you guys got me Chin Chin.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.274
Wow, this is all I used to eat growing up.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.944
We know you haven't been home in a while, so we thought we'd bring some home to you.

20:36.028 --> 20:37.696
You guys, man.

20:48.832 --> 20:51.293
-Hey. Happy Birthday, Sam. -Thank you, Coach.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.170
We got a few things in there for you.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.796
Coach, what's this?

20:55.464 --> 20:58.383
Well, my little boy gave me a whole bunch of these.

20:58.467 --> 21:00.177
You know, help keep me safe while I'm away.

21:01.720 --> 21:02.888
I miss him, you know.

21:03.680 --> 21:07.309
My dad used to-- always used to pinch my earlobes for good luck.

21:08.977 --> 21:10.812
Give me a fucking break.

21:14.525 --> 21:15.526
Sorry, Coach.

21:16.944 --> 21:19.196
Coach, is it okay if I don't keep this?

21:19.279 --> 21:22.824
I don't really have the same fondness for the American military that you do.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.910
Sure. Right.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.703
-Imperialism. Right. Yeah. -Imperialism.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.413
Thank you, Coach. Thank you.

21:28.497 --> 21:29.414
All right, fellas.

21:29.498 --> 21:32.709
Let's get out there and show Crystal Palace whose house this is, right?

21:35.462 --> 21:36.713
West meets South again.

21:36.797 --> 21:40.175
It's Derby Day in London, and the atmosphere is electric.

21:40.259 --> 21:43.345
With a new owner in the boardroom and a new manager in the dugout,

21:43.428 --> 21:47.266
will it be a new dawn for the perennial underdog, AFC Richmond?

21:47.891 --> 21:50.727
Welcome to what the home fans call the "Dogtrack."

21:50.811 --> 21:55.357
It's Nelson Road Stadium, for AFC Richmond against Crystal Palace.

21:55.440 --> 21:58.277
I'm Arlo White and this is Chris Powell.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.028
And it's great to be here, Arlo.

22:00.654 --> 22:02.239
-You ready? -Your fly is down.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.616
Thank you.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.701
All right, shall we?

22:06.660 --> 22:08.745
Chris, did you ever play under an American manager?

22:08.829 --> 22:12.332
Never did, Arlo. Wouldn't have minded it. I do speak the language.

22:13.834 --> 22:16.336
Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!

22:23.760 --> 22:27.306
To the fans at home, we do apologize for the fruity language.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.141
Wanker! Wanker!

22:29.725 --> 22:32.311
It was a risky hire by new owner, Rebecca Welton.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.646
Does she know something we don't?

22:34.730 --> 22:36.064
Wanker! Wanker!

22:36.148 --> 22:38.275
Oi! Give him a chance.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.070
Wanker!

22:42.154 --> 22:44.072
We got 90 minutes to prove 'em wrong, yeah?

22:44.781 --> 22:45.782
Let's give it a shot.

22:45.866 --> 22:47.451
Here we go.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.205
And there you go.

22:51.288 --> 22:54.291
It's an inauspicious start to the Ted Lasso era.

22:56.668 --> 23:01.757
Richmond looked disjointed, uninspired, and, you have to say, joyless.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.426
Palace win and Richmond lose 4-1.

23:04.510 --> 23:07.888
The only bright spot being the defensive play of Sam Obisanya.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.223
Only bright spot?

23:09.681 --> 23:12.809
Without me, it would've been 4-0, you miserable old pricks.

23:12.893 --> 23:15.854
And a meaningless consolation goal for Jamie Tartt in injury time.

23:15.938 --> 23:17.231
Thank you!

23:18.357 --> 23:19.983
Jamie. Real quick.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.527
Regarding Jamie Tartt,

23:21.610 --> 23:24.613
it was an insignificant goal by the Manchester City loanee,

23:24.696 --> 23:27.074
but he celebrated like he'd just won the World Cup.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.287
I haven't known you that long, but...

23:33.413 --> 23:36.208
I can honestly say you are the best athlete I have ever coached.

23:38.377 --> 23:39.378
Wow.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.798
Yeah. I mean, I work hard, yeah.

23:42.881 --> 23:43.882
I see it.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.969
You are truly great at everything you do out there.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.179
Except for one thing.

23:49.263 --> 23:50.347
My left foot cross?

23:50.430 --> 23:54.643
No. Jamie, I think that you might be so sure that you're one in a million,

23:55.477 --> 23:58.105
that sometimes you forget that out there, you're just one of eleven.

23:59.857 --> 24:04.236
And if you just figure out some way to turn that "me" into "us"...

24:06.738 --> 24:08.198
the sky's the limit for you.

24:10.701 --> 24:12.494
Was a heck of a goal out there, by the way.

24:13.412 --> 24:14.538
Thanks.

24:19.668 --> 24:22.129
Richmond fall to 13th place.

24:22.212 --> 24:23.964
I'm sure they won't be there very long.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.465
Is that optimism, Chris?

24:25.549 --> 24:27.968
No. Actually, I'm wearing Obsession by Calvin Klein.

24:28.051 --> 24:30.137
That was fucking embarrassing!

24:31.180 --> 24:33.891
I am equally livid.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.058
-Blimey, mate. -Jesus Christ.

24:35.142 --> 24:36.602
Oh, my God.

24:36.685 --> 24:38.437
-Didn't know he had it in him. -Good lad.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.317
Oh, my God.

24:53.452 --> 24:54.453
Hey, come on now.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.663
Hey, let's shake this one off, all right?

24:56.747 --> 24:59.082
Start getting better on Monday. Until then--

24:59.166 --> 25:03.587
Hey, DJ Beard-o, why don't you help pick up the mood in here, all right?

25:04.963 --> 25:07.382
Little Phife Dawg and Q-Tip comin' at you.

25:08.217 --> 25:10.260
Come on now. Everybody get some cake.

25:10.344 --> 25:13.180
You know, it's Sam's birthday. Go ahead, get some sugar in your system.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.264
Go on now.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.024
Hey, y'all.

25:24.107 --> 25:28.153
I come bearing sweet treats to numb the sting of defeat.

25:30.072 --> 25:31.615
-Yeah. -Thank you.

25:31.698 --> 25:35.452
And hey, just so you know, we can play a lot better than we showed today.

25:37.246 --> 25:41.500
I know it would mean a lot to the guys if y'all just came down, joined in.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.418
Let 'em know you're still in their corner.

25:44.878 --> 25:47.005
That's all the arm twisting I'm gonna do though, okay?

25:49.007 --> 25:51.510
Ted, you know what might convince me?

25:52.427 --> 25:55.722
If you told me where you got these delicious biscuits.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.852
Well, if I did that, I wouldn't be able to bring you more on Monday, would I?

26:01.770 --> 26:03.605
All right. Hope to see y'all downstairs.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.732
It's good cake.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.404
Jamie! Trent Crimm, The Independent.

26:10.487 --> 26:14.533
That was quite a beating today. How you taking the loss?

26:15.284 --> 26:18.954
Look, it's not just me though, is it? We're a team. I'm just one of eleven.

26:20.330 --> 26:21.748
-Candy from a baby. -Okay.

26:21.832 --> 26:22.833
They were rubbish.

26:27.504 --> 26:30.424
Fuck it. Yeah, I am taking it pretty hard, you know?

26:30.507 --> 26:32.885
The rest of them, they're all in there eating cake.

26:32.968 --> 26:35.137
-Seriously? -Yeah, seriously, mate.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.640
The new gaffer's got music on in there. It's like a party. It's a joke.

26:59.870 --> 27:03.498
Careful, son. The gaffer's fixed the water pressure.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.585
I hate losing.

27:06.668 --> 27:08.128
Bird by bird, Coach.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.047
-Good night, Coach. -Night, Coach.

27:12.883 --> 27:14.051
Here's trouble.

27:14.885 --> 27:17.012
-I saw the match. -Yeah? What'd you think?

27:17.095 --> 27:18.263
You were rubbish.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.974
-Yeah, maybe so. -Yeah.

27:21.058 --> 27:22.976
I did wanna get your advice on one thing.

27:23.977 --> 27:26.480
What do you think-- Look at that! Got ya!

27:26.563 --> 27:28.565
-Yeah? All right, I underestimated you. -Yeah.

27:28.649 --> 27:31.193
See, no one sees me coming. Come on, what you got? What you got?

27:31.276 --> 27:33.612
That was quick. Okay, I'm gonna take my backpack off now.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.780
We're gonna really do this.

27:34.863 --> 27:37.032
-Let me stretch here a little bit. -All right. Yeah.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.368
Here we go. Okay. All right, now you're in trouble.

27:39.451 --> 27:40.786
Get your breath back.

27:56.969 --> 27:58.136
What?

27:58.220 --> 27:59.388
I just sent you the pictures.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.561
That's exactly what I wanted.

28:07.855 --> 28:10.816
The star player's girlfriend and the new manager.

28:12.484 --> 28:14.069
Are you sure you want to do this?

28:14.152 --> 28:16.488
The press will eat them alive.

28:27.082 --> 28:28.500
Miss Welton?

28:34.089 --> 28:35.174
Do it.
