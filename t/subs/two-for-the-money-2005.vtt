WEBVTT

00:56.000 --> 00:58.860
That's me.

00:58.890 --> 01:01.730
That's my dad.

01:04.340 --> 01:07.150
I remember that day.

01:07.670 --> 01:10.590
And believe it or not, I remember that hit.

01:11.740 --> 01:15.390
I remember it because of the smile
that spread over my dad's face.

01:22.060 --> 01:26.130
Yeah, I'd have stood there all day
just to sink one.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.950
Just to see that smile.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.010
You see, to Pop, sports were a religion.

01:33.050 --> 01:36.100
To me, it was about purity.

01:36.140 --> 01:40.380
Sports was a place
where all wrongs could be made right.

01:40.420 --> 01:45.840
I thought if I filled the whole house
with trophies for him, he'd stick around.

01:45.870 --> 01:48.200
Well, I did.

01:48.240 --> 01:50.530
He left before my tenth birthday.

01:55.430 --> 01:58.730
The Championship
has come down to this final play.

01:58.770 --> 02:02.000
The Sun Devils trail by four.
The ball on the Aztec 15.

02:02.040 --> 02:03.630
Seven seconds left on the clock.

02:03.670 --> 02:07.430
Settle it down.
Pro-right tiger. This is your game.

02:07.460 --> 02:11.140
Now let's go. Let's go get 'em.
Now let's go! Let's go!

02:11.180 --> 02:14.830
Sun Devils' ball.
First down and ten yards to go.

02:14.860 --> 02:17.500
Here we go men last play.
It's fun time!

02:17.540 --> 02:23.070
Pro-right tiger. Wide check. 532 double fly
on two Scottie. Guaranteed TD.

02:23.100 --> 02:24.900
We gotta worry about one thing men.

02:24.950 --> 02:28.390
After we win this game
they'll be putting cameras in your faces.

02:28.420 --> 02:31.200
Don't give them "Hi Mom"s and shit.
It's overused.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.870
You gotta thank somebody thank me.

02:33.910 --> 02:36.830
- I'll see you in the end zone men. Ready?
- Break!

02:37.350 --> 02:39.710
I was a quarterback
since peewee football -

02:39.750 --> 02:44.450
set high-school records, won
state championships. This was pertect.

02:44.480 --> 02:46.910
Coming at you 57.

02:46.950 --> 02:51.120
Bowl game, national TV,
there were pro scouts in the stands,

02:51.150 --> 02:53.580
and I knew exactly
what was gonna happen next.

02:53.620 --> 02:57.480
Lang has led the Sun
Devils to four comebacks this season.

02:57.510 --> 03:01.400
Can he do it?
Win their first bowl game in 12 years?

03:01.440 --> 03:06.140
Lang barks the signals. The Aztecs have
eight in the box. They're showing blitz.

03:06.170 --> 03:08.600
Lang takes the snap,
fades back into the pocket.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.710
He looks for Ravis on the right.
Sherman breaks through.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.640
Lang's in trouble. He shakes Sherman off,
nearly goes down.

03:14.690 --> 03:20.110
He's looking to throw. Two seconds to go.
There he goes. He's going to run it.

03:20.140 --> 03:23.450
He's got to get in the end zone.
And that safety is stepping up.

03:23.480 --> 03:25.840
Can he make it?

03:27.300 --> 03:30.180
- Touchdown!
- Argh!

03:30.220 --> 03:36.060
My first thought was I could tape it
and play next week. Then I puked.

03:41.800 --> 03:45.660
When do I play again Doc?
What's the rehab time?

03:45.690 --> 03:47.950
I'm not sure son.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.320
Football wasn't a sport.

04:04.350 --> 04:06.580
It was my life.

04:06.620 --> 04:09.430
And I wasn't gonna give up now.

04:09.460 --> 04:11.690
I would play again.

04:11.730 --> 04:16.209
In the meantime I needed ajob
to hold me over between tryouts.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.459
Then one day, and it didn't take long,

04:18.510 --> 04:21.579
six years had passed
and I woke up at the bottom.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.920
"You have reached
the Jessica Simpson hotline.

04:24.950 --> 04:27.740
"Jessica will tell you
about Nick's birthday party

04:27.790 --> 04:31.390
"and a whole lot more about
her rocking new panty line at Wal-Mart.

04:31.440 --> 04:36.230
"But first here's a little fan trivia
to win a VIP gold-package backstage pass

04:36.260 --> 04:38.750
"to Jessica's Omnicon Hotel summer tour. "

04:38.790 --> 04:41.200
- Lang.
- "The question... " I'm taping boss.

04:41.240 --> 04:45.200
Look. I got a job for you. Bauer's sick.
I can't update his betting line.

04:45.230 --> 04:47.870
- You know anything about sports?
- Yeah a little.

04:47.910 --> 04:52.980
900 numbers, audio text.
The racket had a lot of names.

04:53.020 --> 04:58.440
This guy's gig was sports handicapping -
predicting winners for people who bet.

04:58.480 --> 05:01.270
I was supposed tojust record his picks.

05:01.310 --> 05:04.080
Thing was, I didn't agree with them.

05:04.110 --> 05:06.060
No they're not.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.520
Living in Las Vegas, it was easy to gauge
the temperature of the betting public.

05:12.550 --> 05:14.770
The problem is they're usually wrong.

05:14.820 --> 05:18.360
What's up Stu?
Where's all the action this weekend?

05:18.390 --> 05:21.280
Tampa-Oakland.
Everyone's jumping on Oakland.

05:21.310 --> 05:23.220
- That's crazy.
- You think?

05:23.260 --> 05:26.450
Yeah man.
That game's gonna be won by coaching.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.830
Gruden put that Oakland team together
before he came to Tampa.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.670
He knows every strength and weakness.

05:31.710 --> 05:37.030
Brown catches to his left so he'll have
him double-teamed to the defender's right.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.070
Gannon throws on a three-step drop.

05:39.110 --> 05:42.760
He'll stack the midfield with line backers
take away the short pass.

05:42.790 --> 05:45.160
Gannon will throw three or four NTs Sunday.

05:45.190 --> 05:47.210
Fuck me.

05:47.250 --> 05:50.220
- You took Oaktown?
- Yeah what do you think?

05:50.250 --> 05:53.150
I think I gotta
save your ass one more time.

05:53.190 --> 05:57.880
Take Tampa Bay on the money line.
They're gonna win this game outright.

05:57.910 --> 05:59.720
- Bet 'em big.
- Thanks B.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.830
Stu did bet 'em big,
and he won ten grand.

06:04.870 --> 06:08.620
I was quickly becoming
the biggest 900 line in Vegas.

06:09.460 --> 06:13.210
"Kansas City is seven to one against
point spread v division opponents

06:13.240 --> 06:17.240
"coming off a Monday night game.
Take KC minus the six.

06:17.280 --> 06:24.370
"Call tomorrow for my pro-football game
of the year. That's here at 900-656-3100.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.580
"Until then this is Brandon Lang
saying good night and good gambling. "

06:31.040 --> 06:32.920
Big plans this weekend?

06:32.950 --> 06:35.110
There you go.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.800
Steve. I went nine and two
on pro football Sunday

06:40.320 --> 06:42.890
and hit my third straight
Monday-night parlay.

06:42.930 --> 06:46.790
- It's worth 12 bucks an hour.
- Hey I don't make 12 an hour.

06:46.820 --> 06:49.040
You're not picking 75%.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.420
If you're that good why don't you
bet your own games get rich?

06:52.450 --> 06:54.470
Send me a postcard from the riviera.

06:54.510 --> 06:58.260
By Unwritten Law)

06:59.930 --> 07:02.010
What's going on Denny?

07:02.050 --> 07:04.100
Hey man. What's up?

07:04.520 --> 07:07.400
Big bro's making them greenbacks.
How about you bro?

07:07.440 --> 07:10.770
I scrounged up some old headers B.
Check it out. Fire it up.

07:10.810 --> 07:12.550
All right here goes.

07:14.740 --> 07:19.690
Jeez I'm late. Honey dinner's in the oven.
Where the hell's my lucky crucifix?

07:19.740 --> 07:24.640
Oh I forgot to tell you. The mail came
and there's a letter for you from Chicago.

07:24.670 --> 07:27.350
You just went there
for your tryout last week.

07:27.880 --> 07:32.420
Another rejection letter.
"... strength of your knee in question. "

07:32.460 --> 07:37.890
I only had two Arena teams left,
and after that there was always the CFL.

07:37.920 --> 07:40.970
You can't save me

07:41.020 --> 07:44.000
You can't change me

07:44.040 --> 07:48.370
Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

07:48.400 --> 07:52.690
And everything, everything's my fault

07:52.730 --> 07:54.630
Whoa! So what do you think?

07:54.680 --> 07:59.220
Should I ride shotgun
or do you want to hop on the handlebars?

07:59.260 --> 08:03.540
Hey the packaging's not that great
but there's a prize on the inside.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.360
What do you say? No?

08:06.390 --> 08:08.190
Oh that's OK.

08:08.230 --> 08:10.840
You'll be back. I'll have a life.

08:12.400 --> 08:16.260
Well, I'm waiting for my wake-up call

08:16.290 --> 08:19.080
And everything's my fault

08:19.110 --> 08:20.950
Good morning Mary.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.290
This is Brandon.

08:25.330 --> 08:29.400
Congratulations, you went nine and two
last Sunday. This is Walter Abrams.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.470
I don't know if you know me. I run
the biggest sports service in the country,

08:33.500 --> 08:35.299
and I'm a big fan of yours, Brandon.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.330
As a matter of fact,
I've got a poster of you on my wall.

08:38.370 --> 08:42.190
- This is a joke right?
- No, this is not ajoke. This is ajob offer.

08:42.230 --> 08:47.650
In your top drawer- go ahead, open it up -
there's an envelope with your name on it.

08:47.680 --> 08:52.340
Now, that's travel cash and an airline
ticket. It's not a magic trick, Brandon.

08:52.370 --> 08:53.970
I paid someone to put it there,

08:54.010 --> 08:58.080
who told me that the place you're in
reminded him of a Turkish prison.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.960
Now, all I'm asking you to do
is come up with a number.

09:01.000 --> 09:04.540
You write down the number
of what you make now, you cross it out,

09:04.570 --> 09:06.590
you write what you should be making,

09:06.630 --> 09:11.220
and then toss in how much it's gonna take
to get you to fly to New York first-class

09:11.250 --> 09:13.160
and come work for me.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.660
Now, focus, Brandon, focus.

09:15.700 --> 09:20.500
With your bum knee, a comeback
isjust a dream. My offer is real.

09:20.530 --> 09:22.790
Run the numbers, do the math.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.500
Hold on a second. Yeah.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.220
Mom holding twojobs,
Denny going to college,

09:29.260 --> 09:32.240
this looked like a chance
to make some real money.

09:32.280 --> 09:36.240
And besides, I'd never seen New York
and New York had never seen me.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.020
Oh goodness. Hey.

09:38.050 --> 09:39.370
All right.

09:44.060 --> 09:49.070
So what's this guy Walter like?
How long have you been working for him?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.380
A long time.

09:50.430 --> 09:53.510
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.

09:53.550 --> 09:56.580
Every day with Walter's an adventure.

09:56.610 --> 09:58.410
Super cool, super mean

09:58.460 --> 10:02.170
Feelin' good for the man,
supertly, here I stand

10:02.210 --> 10:06.380
Secret stash, heavy bread,
baddest bitches in the bed

10:06.410 --> 10:08.990
I'm your pusherman

10:10.240 --> 10:12.530
I'm your pusherman

10:28.170 --> 10:30.430
That's OK.

10:30.470 --> 10:33.280
All right double it. Triple it.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.060
No everything's about money.

10:36.100 --> 10:41.520
Listen this Sunday my little girl
an angel turns six.

10:41.550 --> 10:43.250
This is not likely to happen again.

10:43.300 --> 10:47.260
She loves elephants.
Your circus has ten. I only need one.

10:47.680 --> 10:52.530
Now my little girl's happiness
is in your hands.

10:52.580 --> 10:55.700
I don't need advice
from a guy who doubles as a clown.

10:55.740 --> 10:58.580
I need a fucking elephant.
Now I'm willing to pay.

10:58.620 --> 11:03.940
What'll it take to grease your wheels
and get one here this weekend? Hello?

11:04.260 --> 11:05.990
Fuckwad!

11:06.030 --> 11:09.890
Find Ringling Brothers. Get someone
who understands profit. Whoa!

11:09.920 --> 11:11.620
Brandon Lang.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.810
The Marlboro man here.

11:13.850 --> 11:17.080
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey you're in great shape.

11:17.110 --> 11:20.640
- I've been in better.
- You're modest too. Oh!

11:20.680 --> 11:24.170
Modesty - not a virtue.
Could be a vice. Sit down.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.430
There are rules to success my friend.

11:26.470 --> 11:29.970
Rule number one is know what you know
know what you don't know

11:30.010 --> 11:33.770
and know that I gotta know everything
you know as soon as you know it.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.020
- Sooner.
- Yes sir.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.670
- You ever sell before?
- No.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
- Are you religious?
- I believe in God.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.090
Hey Liz.

11:44.190 --> 11:48.370
This is me 30 years ago right?
It's remarkable the resemblance.

11:48.400 --> 11:51.140
I mean he's a little taller. I'll give him that.

11:51.180 --> 11:56.920
Oh boy you know I'm not supposed
to do this. It's bad for my... condition.

11:57.020 --> 12:00.460
Nobody knows this Liz OK?

12:00.490 --> 12:03.340
So before I die...

12:03.380 --> 12:06.350
Did you do anything
other than sports phone in Vegas?

12:06.410 --> 12:09.330
Just the 900 recordings
you know 10 bucks a call.

12:09.360 --> 12:10.790
That's chump change.

12:10.890 --> 12:13.560
I mean we're going after
much bigger fish here.

12:13.600 --> 12:17.510
You know networks don't talk about it
government can't tax it

12:17.770 --> 12:21.420
but sports betting
is a 200-billion-dollar-a-year business.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.360
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.550
A lot of gamblers out there man
and they have needs.

12:25.590 --> 12:32.060
And come Monday morning after a losing
weekend they got big needs. Gargantuan.

12:33.940 --> 12:37.230
See that? That's every
football game played last Sunday.

12:37.270 --> 12:41.290
You know why Monday-night football's
the most watched game of the week?

12:41.320 --> 12:45.300
Monday's the last chance bettors have
to climb out of the hole they got in

12:45.330 --> 12:47.240
to pay their bookies on Tuesday.

12:47.280 --> 12:51.560
Sports betting's illegal in 49 states
including this one.

12:51.590 --> 12:53.390
But what we do is not.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.460
We are 100% legal like stockbrokers

12:57.500 --> 13:01.840
only instead of counting stocks
we advise people on how to bet.

13:01.880 --> 13:06.680
Now if a client wins by taking our advice
we get a percentage or we ask for one

13:07.200 --> 13:11.480
which they will gladly give us because
they want to keep getting the advice.

13:11.510 --> 13:14.560
But if they lose we get zip.

13:14.600 --> 13:21.490
So the object here my dear
tall athletic religious friend is to win.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.890
I can do that.

13:26.600 --> 13:30.040
- Hello. This is Walter...
- Hello Walter.

13:30.980 --> 13:33.650
That's my cable show.

13:33.690 --> 13:36.880
Now, after a nice
five-day vacation on my yacht...

13:36.920 --> 13:41.820
Airs Saturday and Sunday morning
nationwide. We tape Thursday and Fri...

13:41.850 --> 13:43.590
What's going on with my hair?

13:43.700 --> 13:46.260
He did it again Liz.

13:46.310 --> 13:49.910
I got one part of my head in Cleveland
the other's in Chicago.

13:49.960 --> 13:54.020
What are we gonna do with this guy?
My barber. Should be shot. I want him dead.

13:54.050 --> 13:56.270
For the first time,

13:56.320 --> 14:01.630
I'm gonna release our three-team
college and pro parlays absolutely free.

14:01.670 --> 14:06.430
If all the picks are free
how'd you get the yacht?

14:06.460 --> 14:08.320
There's no yacht.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.190
Next question.

14:10.290 --> 14:15.300
Why give any picks for free?
Why not charge a fee up-front initially?

14:15.330 --> 14:17.810
You make a good point. Next.

14:17.850 --> 14:20.260
What's on the second floor?

14:20.300 --> 14:23.320
That's where we print the money.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.250
- Anything else?
- Of course not.

14:27.290 --> 14:31.300
No I think I've got it.
I think everything's crystal clear Walter.

14:31.330 --> 14:35.320
I like you you know that?
You and me - this thing's gonna work.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.760
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Me too.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.800
Ringling Brothers on one.

14:40.840 --> 14:45.010
Tell them to hold that elephant.
You ever have a manicure?

14:45.050 --> 14:46.640
There's a girl you gotta meet.

14:46.680 --> 14:52.000
- Yeah? What's she like?
- She's beautiful. You're gonna like her.

14:52.030 --> 14:53.460
Is this Barnum or Bailey?

14:58.880 --> 15:01.180
- I've got it.
- He's all yours.

15:01.210 --> 15:03.010
- Brandon?
- Yeah.

15:03.050 --> 15:04.930
- Hi. I'm Toni.
- Nice to meet you.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.980
Walter said you'd stop by.

15:07.020 --> 15:09.370
- This was his idea.
- Yeah I know.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.920
Does he make
all of his employees do this?

15:11.950 --> 15:14.280
- Yep. Every one.
- How often?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.610
Once. Before they start work.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.760
- Weird.
- You think?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.370
I never had my nails done before.

15:21.410 --> 15:24.950
Yeah I can see that
but you've got strong hands. That's nice.

15:24.980 --> 15:26.580
Do you drink?

15:26.620 --> 15:28.190
Excuse me?

15:28.290 --> 15:31.940
- Alcohol. Are you a drinker?
- I have a beer every once in a while.

15:31.970 --> 15:34.510
- Do you smoke?
- No.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.260
- What about gambling?
- What about it?

15:37.570 --> 15:40.490
I'm sorry. I'm just a bit pressed for time.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.410
- I asked do you bet? Are you a bettor?
- No.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.550
Really?

15:45.580 --> 15:47.370
Why not?

15:48.310 --> 15:50.610
Toni huh?

15:52.270 --> 15:56.450
- Are you here full time?
- Yeah no this is my shop. I better be.

15:56.480 --> 15:58.800
So why don't you gamble?

15:58.840 --> 16:03.430
Well I did once.
I wagered everything I had and I lost.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.640
So?

16:04.680 --> 16:07.670
I just swore I'd never do it again.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.860
- You're sticking to that story?
- Yeah.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.670
I'm not gonna start
this relationship off by lying.

16:12.710 --> 16:17.820
That's good. Walter could definitely use
someone with a little resolve in his life.

16:19.390 --> 16:21.640
Hey Toni.

16:21.680 --> 16:24.180
Would you have dinner with me tonight?

16:24.220 --> 16:26.120
What do you say?

16:26.170 --> 16:29.190
- He didn't tell you.
- Tell me what?

16:29.220 --> 16:31.590
Brandon Walter and I are married.

16:32.740 --> 16:36.800
Oh. Oh bogey. Wait a minute.
Wait wait wait. Listen.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.640
He said to come to meet a nice lady...

16:38.680 --> 16:41.560
I'm sure he did.
That's OK. I'll kill him when I get home.

16:41.600 --> 16:46.290
He has a big bright beautiful spirit
though and you will love working for him.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.130
But he is held together by meetings.

16:48.170 --> 16:51.090
If it has "anonymous" at the end
he goes. He has to.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.860
He also has to be careful
who he lets into his life.

16:53.900 --> 16:57.970
Most ways Walter's brilliant
but he can be bullshitted and I can't.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.910
He sends them to me before hiring them.

16:59.950 --> 17:02.660
- So this was my interview.
- Oh you're swift.

17:02.690 --> 17:04.390
How'd I do?

17:04.440 --> 17:07.980
Except for an illegal forward pass perfect.
Congratulations.

17:08.010 --> 17:09.339
Thank you very much.

17:09.369 --> 17:11.900
1-800-238-6648.

17:11.940 --> 17:15.490
1-800 bet on it. Absolutely free.

17:15.700 --> 17:19.349
This is the first floor,
and it's all yours.

17:19.380 --> 17:23.829
The TV's satellite and it swivels.

17:23.859 --> 17:25.770
Your bedroom.

17:25.810 --> 17:29.780
Got a Jacuzzi in there
the size of a kiddy pool.

17:30.920 --> 17:34.360
You know what this is?
Looks like weights to me.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.410
Yeah baby.

17:36.450 --> 17:39.890
Now I'm gonna put your copy here...

17:39.920 --> 17:42.350
on your desk.

17:42.390 --> 17:44.330
Walter this is sweet ass.

17:44.370 --> 17:48.650
- A man's chair.
- That's what I'm talking about.

17:49.590 --> 17:54.120
OK. I'm gonna start you on the 900 numbers.
Same gig you had in Vegas.

17:54.180 --> 17:58.660
Make your picks record them each day.
Monday through Friday once a day.

17:58.690 --> 18:00.540
- Five times a day on a weekend.
- Mm-hm.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.620
Each call's worth 25 bucks a shot.

18:03.670 --> 18:07.110
Now we're doing about
three dozen hits a week. That's nothing.

18:07.140 --> 18:08.670
We should triple that.

18:08.780 --> 18:14.510
Now before you get into your test copy
here I got a few words for you.

18:14.540 --> 18:16.560
Your pitch sucks. No offence.

18:16.600 --> 18:20.870
But you got potential
so we gotta find a way to bust you out.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.400
- Bust me out?
- Yeah.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.980
We're gonna start
by giving you a new name.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.800
John Anthony. Just came to me.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.390
John Anthony the million-dollar man.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.220
What's wrong with Brandon Lang?

18:35.260 --> 18:39.960
Nothing's wrong with Brandon Lang.
It's just that he's still living with his mommy.

18:39.990 --> 18:41.690
John Anthony's living large.

18:41.730 --> 18:45.020
He don't hold back.
He's got a direct line to God.

18:45.070 --> 18:50.180
And for a measly 25 bucks a call
he's gonna let the world's losers listen in.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.430
"Hello sports fans.

18:52.470 --> 18:56.640
"This is John Anthony in the Big Apple
with my big-money picks.

18:56.670 --> 18:59.210
"The action starts Saturday
with college ball

18:59.250 --> 19:02.790
"and our first match-up
is Michigan against Indiana.

19:02.820 --> 19:04.730
"The Wolverines... "

19:04.770 --> 19:06.510
I already hung up.

19:06.550 --> 19:10.200
John Anthony here ready to make
all your betting dreams come true.

19:10.230 --> 19:13.750
That's right.
Call me right now and let me win for you.

19:13.790 --> 19:17.290
The point spread
in the Indiana-Michigan game is at...

19:17.320 --> 19:19.270
- I think it's all right.
- Wrong.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.610
Mm-hm.

19:23.650 --> 19:25.280
OK what's your sales pitch?

19:25.320 --> 19:29.180
My sales pitch is I'm picking 80% winners.

19:30.110 --> 19:32.160
Stats is not enough.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.450
I'm telling you you need a voice.

19:34.490 --> 19:39.600
These are gamblers ready to risk what
they can't afford for what they can't have.

19:39.630 --> 19:42.000
You're selling
the world's rarest commodity.

19:42.030 --> 19:44.610
You're selling certainty...

19:44.640 --> 19:47.010
in an uncertain world.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.640
John Anthony here
the million-dollar man.

19:58.690 --> 20:03.540
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood. All
your big money stays and plays with me.

20:03.570 --> 20:08.380
Sit back and relax. It's a Scud attack this
weekend. I am shelling your bookmaker.

20:08.420 --> 20:12.140
Follow his block and cut to the right.
Going in Liz. Going in.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.580
That's it isn't it? Huh?

20:16.410 --> 20:19.330
- It's a start.
- It's a start?

20:19.750 --> 20:22.000
What can I tell you?

20:22.040 --> 20:26.220
That's not what you want
then you need to find somebody else to sell

20:26.250 --> 20:28.260
and let me just pick.

20:28.300 --> 20:30.600
It's not about what I want.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.200
You understand?
It's about what Brandon wants.

20:33.230 --> 20:36.540
If I hear that I'm calling this number.

20:37.690 --> 20:40.500
Whoa whoa whoa.
Easy easy. Easy easy.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.320
What is it? What is it? What is it?

20:43.350 --> 20:44.780
Shh.

20:45.920 --> 20:47.760
Should I call somebody?

20:47.800 --> 20:50.620
Not unless they got a spare heart.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.370
Shh.

20:56.040 --> 20:59.590
Oh it's a small one. It's a teeny one.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.530
Breathe it out.

21:01.570 --> 21:04.170
- What do you need? Some water?
- I'll be all right.

21:04.210 --> 21:06.790
Oh I know what I want.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.390
I know what I want.

21:11.160 --> 21:14.910
Be a good boy and get me a light.
Right there.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.870
What are you doing?

21:32.430 --> 21:35.560
Courage wants to laugh.

21:36.810 --> 21:40.150
He makes the snap,
looks right, he throws.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.880
Phillips in for the touchdown!

21:41.920 --> 21:47.510
...clearly in the defense
that does not give up the big plays.

21:47.550 --> 21:52.870
...23 over West Virginia.
Pittsburgh on a 47-yard field goal

21:52.900 --> 21:54.500
leads Virginia 10-7.

21:54.540 --> 21:57.210
North Carolina and Florida are scoreless.

21:57.250 --> 22:02.260
25th ranked Kansas trails Mississippi 7-3.
We'll be back with more scores...

22:02.290 --> 22:05.700
Back to the one-yard line...

22:06.640 --> 22:09.100
...and it will go against Utah again.

22:09.140 --> 22:12.270
With time-out on the field,
let's go to our studios in New York

22:12.300 --> 22:15.510
for an update on today's college football.

22:15.550 --> 22:18.590
Brandon!

22:18.630 --> 22:20.610
How we doing?

22:21.650 --> 22:22.860
Down here.

22:22.900 --> 22:27.390
...while Michigan
just put the hammer to Illinois. 44-12.

22:27.420 --> 22:30.580
Florida - no problem
beating North Carolina 42 to 7,

22:30.620 --> 22:33.750
while Northern Washington
upset Iowa State 28-21.

22:33.780 --> 22:37.820
Pennsylvania
manhandled Kentucky 31 to 3.

22:37.850 --> 22:39.760
Bullshit!

22:39.800 --> 22:42.560
...with a 17-7 win at Idaho.

22:42.590 --> 22:45.320
And thisjust in. Arizona is hot.

22:45.360 --> 22:48.350
All right! All right!

22:48.770 --> 22:51.750
This guy is a machine. I mean he...

22:51.790 --> 22:55.820
All he does is work out and pick winners.

22:55.860 --> 23:00.240
Talk about fit.
You should see him with his shirt off.

23:00.270 --> 23:03.640
Really. I did. A serious side of beef.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.010
Enjoy your daughter's birthday. Come on.

23:07.950 --> 23:11.600
What do you mean?
You should check him out.

23:11.630 --> 23:13.900
- I know you want to.
- Walter.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.570
Get out of your head.
It's a bad neighborhood.

23:16.610 --> 23:19.530
Touchdown!

23:30.790 --> 23:34.750
I'm gonna have the bruchetta here
and this right here.

23:34.780 --> 23:38.090
Very good.
And may I say sir an excellent choice.

23:38.820 --> 23:42.260
I think it's pronounced "bruschetta. "
"Bruschetta. "

23:42.290 --> 23:45.700
They're little pizzas
but they don't have cheese in them.

23:45.730 --> 23:47.950
- Bruschetta?
- Perfect.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.520
Who cares? Anyone who goes 20 for 24
college football 12 for 14 professional

23:53.550 --> 23:59.050
175 calls on the 900 number you can
call bruschetta anything you want son.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.340
Ever have
a thousand-dollar bottle of wine?

24:01.380 --> 24:02.970
- No.
- Steward!

24:03.010 --> 24:07.290
- Walter it's a waste. He hardly drinks.
- It's a celebration. Steward.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.120
- Walter it's...
- Toni come on.

24:09.170 --> 24:12.920
Just 'cause he's with reformed drunks
doesn't mean he can't enjoy himself.

24:12.950 --> 24:15.840
I was a lot of things Walter
I was never a drunk.

24:15.870 --> 24:17.990
Actually truth be told

24:18.030 --> 24:21.780
I've never had
a 12-dollar bottle of water either.

24:22.410 --> 24:24.390
- He thinks we're fighting.
- Yeah.

24:24.490 --> 24:30.750
No I don't. Look hey this is great
all of this. Thank you Walter Toni.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.360
Watch out Walter. He's a fixer.

24:33.980 --> 24:37.700
- I should've ordered two.
- What did the doctor say? Come on.

24:37.740 --> 24:42.120
Well if you really want to know - I've been
meaning to tell you - I went yesterday

24:42.150 --> 24:44.160
and he seemed very concerned.

24:44.200 --> 24:48.170
Afterwards he sat me down
and looked into my eyes and he said:

24:48.200 --> 24:50.840
"Walter...

24:50.880 --> 24:53.800
"who do you like
in the Buffalo-Oakland game?"

24:56.090 --> 25:00.740
- You tell him Buffalo?
- Shit Walter. It wasn't funny.

25:00.780 --> 25:05.480
You didn't know I was joking?
It's a joke. Jokes are funny.

25:08.290 --> 25:12.570
Wow what a meal.
You haven't touched your sauce.

25:12.600 --> 25:15.030
It's chocolate. I hear it's good for you.

25:15.070 --> 25:19.140
- I'm not raising a kid alone Walter.
- Come on don't be dramatic Toni.

25:19.170 --> 25:23.410
In biblical times you'd just move in
with my brother Morty anyway.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.520
Oh look at that.

25:28.830 --> 25:31.700
Beauty and the beasts.
What do you think?

25:31.730 --> 25:34.570
I like her man.
I think she's extremely cute.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.590
Brandon she's looking at you.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.410
Yeah but so are
those two guys she's with.

25:40.720 --> 25:46.560
I tell you what. I'll bet you ten to one
on a thousand you can't pick her up.

25:46.590 --> 25:49.860
That's 10000 cash
if you leave this restaurant with that girl.

25:49.900 --> 25:54.170
I have a better idea. Why don't we go to
Atlantic City and open a house account?

25:54.210 --> 25:55.910
You know you can't gamble. Come on.

25:55.950 --> 26:01.370
Who's gambling? I haven't flipped a coin
since the '80s. This is just a challenge.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.780
A challenge?

26:03.820 --> 26:06.400
10000... to one.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.940
- Cash?
- Mm-hm.

26:08.980 --> 26:12.110
What are you gonna do?

26:12.740 --> 26:15.130
- I'm gonna introduce myself.
- Before...

26:15.170 --> 26:16.870
Before you make your move sit.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.510
- Where are you going?
- No problem. Don't worry.

26:19.550 --> 26:21.910
You sit here and rest your little self.

26:22.960 --> 26:27.020
Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt
or anything but I just gotta know this.

26:27.050 --> 26:30.150
We're sitting over there
with my friends and I'm thinking...

26:30.180 --> 26:33.240
You are drop-dead gorgeous
and we just want to know...

26:33.280 --> 26:37.090
Your dates look like they haven't
missed a meal since Christ died.

26:37.240 --> 26:40.890
Seriously you're eating
like you got a date with the electric chair.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.250
What is going on? No no no.

26:43.290 --> 26:45.580
It's all over. Sit sit sit.

26:45.620 --> 26:47.520
Just joking. Sorry.

26:47.570 --> 26:51.480
- I don't want to get wounded with a fork.
- Jerk. Moron.

26:51.510 --> 26:55.390
- I'm gone. Thank you very much.
- What the hell was that?

26:55.420 --> 26:57.430
- I went too far.
- Oh yeah.

26:57.470 --> 27:01.540
- I'll buy them a bottle of champagne.
- You'll pick up their check.

27:01.570 --> 27:04.260
The voice of reason.

27:04.300 --> 27:06.960
Thank you. Uh-oh.

27:07.270 --> 27:10.400
Your date's going to the bathroom.

27:14.050 --> 27:17.600
I don't think that
helped me out too much do you?

27:17.630 --> 27:18.490
Well...

27:18.540 --> 27:21.610
But hey thanks for the introduction.

27:21.660 --> 27:24.690
Hey I was just raising the bar a little.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.500
John Anthony could close her.

27:32.410 --> 27:35.390
You are beautiful.

27:35.430 --> 27:38.560
- Excuse me.
- Hang on a second.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.170
I want to get to know you.

27:42.210 --> 27:45.540
You just want to get in my pants.

27:46.900 --> 27:50.860
No. No no no no no. I want to get
in your mind and your heart and your soul

27:50.890 --> 27:55.140
and I don't see you
wearing any pants in that equation.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.830
Do you?

28:01.290 --> 28:03.900
Let me ask you something.

28:43.210 --> 28:46.130
OK, forget the 900 numbers.
Now you're ready.

28:46.160 --> 28:49.010
We're moving up.
We're going to the second floor.

28:49.050 --> 28:53.430
This is where we print the money.
Put your ear to the door.

28:53.460 --> 28:55.100
Wow.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.390
That's the sound of possibilities.

28:58.440 --> 29:01.980
This is it. This is where
the sales people turn a ten-dollar bettor

29:02.010 --> 29:05.320
into a 1000-dollar bettor
before he knows he made the call.

29:05.350 --> 29:08.650
I'm asking do they use
Astroturf or AstroPlay?

29:08.690 --> 29:11.320
Tammy. Give it up baby.

29:11.370 --> 29:13.620
- You know what I need.
- Sure do.

29:13.660 --> 29:16.330
- Tammy this is Brandon.
- How are you Tammy?

29:16.370 --> 29:20.020
OK this is our phone sheet.
The losers who need us.

29:20.050 --> 29:21.860
The more they bet the more we win.

29:21.900 --> 29:26.490
We take 10% of a winning bet
anywhere from 500 to 500000.

29:26.520 --> 29:29.730
- That's Southie.
- Let's make some serious money.

29:29.770 --> 29:32.910
- What's the game plan?
- You know what?

29:32.950 --> 29:37.230
You're a private security guard.
Bang a cheerleader extract the information.

29:37.440 --> 29:42.340
Well it was a substantial sum.
Walter he's a little miffed at our picks.

29:42.370 --> 29:43.800
Just do what you got to do.

29:43.900 --> 29:47.340
It says right here
that the minimum bet is five grand.

29:47.370 --> 29:51.780
Reggie Hawks. Best salesman ever. Ever.

29:51.830 --> 29:55.370
I don't have time for this kind of shit
Jimmy. I know you're a loser.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.080
If you were a big winner
you wouldn't pay to call me.

29:58.920 --> 30:02.050
You got your head
outta your ass yet?

30:02.780 --> 30:05.340
Is this my office?

30:05.380 --> 30:09.760
- Well do you like it?
- What's not to like Walter? Thank you.

30:10.490 --> 30:13.270
Miami New York point spread
just went up to ten.

30:13.310 --> 30:17.850
- What do you think?
- Miami is a lock. Are you kidding me?

30:17.900 --> 30:22.480
This is Jerry my top handicapper.
Came to me straight out of grad school.

30:22.520 --> 30:25.940
Whoa. Phone boy makes good huh?
It's a big jump from 900 numbers.

30:25.980 --> 30:29.340
Make sure you don't get
a nosebleed up here. I'm just kidding.

30:29.380 --> 30:32.700
- Nice meeting you. Gotta get to work.
- Nice meeting you too.

30:32.740 --> 30:35.690
Say by the way tonight's game...

30:35.730 --> 30:38.650
New York wins that outright.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.900
Really?

30:40.000 --> 30:43.090
They always play the Fish tough
and tonight it's foregone.

30:43.130 --> 30:47.620
I wish I had a pen because I would
never write that down. You know...

30:47.650 --> 30:50.180
college is right for you.

30:50.220 --> 30:53.820
You have to work your way up
to pro ball around here. Good luck.

30:53.850 --> 30:57.420
Rookie's got balls.
I almost like it but I don't. Good luck.

30:57.450 --> 30:58.880
I get that all day.

30:58.980 --> 31:03.880
You know I got three guys who can
pick games I got 20 who can sell.

31:03.910 --> 31:06.610
I never had one who could do both.

31:06.650 --> 31:08.910
- What? You mean me?
- No not you.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.580
I'm talking about John Anthony.

31:11.610 --> 31:14.210
John Anthony doesn't exist.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.880
Oh? Well I'm shocked

31:15.980 --> 31:20.460
because I'm standing in his office
and you're sitting in his chair.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.970
So you want me to sell.

31:23.910 --> 31:26.200
- Like those guys out there?
- Yes.

31:26.300 --> 31:30.580
Big bettors don't want middlemen.
They want the guy giving them the picks.

31:30.610 --> 31:33.390
- You got a problem with selling?
- No. I don't have a...

31:33.430 --> 31:35.440
There's a few choice phrases we use here.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.250
You just start with those.
Now here's an easy one.

31:38.300 --> 31:41.840
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's fucking money.

31:42.050 --> 31:44.930
Give it back to me.

31:44.970 --> 31:47.210
I don't want your money.

31:47.580 --> 31:49.410
I want your bookie's money.

31:49.450 --> 31:53.000
I don't want your money.
I want your bookie's money.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.830
That's not bad.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.480
- What happened to "fuck"?
- What about it?

31:57.510 --> 32:00.050
- I said it. You don't use it?
- Nah.

32:00.090 --> 32:03.840
- Really? A religious thing?
- No it's not a religious thing. I just...

32:03.880 --> 32:07.030
It was all right for Chaucer 600 years ago.

32:07.080 --> 32:10.570
Hey! I don't want to embarrass you
but I gotta do this.

32:11.040 --> 32:14.060
I got someone here
who has a problem saying "fuck. "

32:14.090 --> 32:16.980
- Hold on.
- Fuck you!

32:19.900 --> 32:22.720
Look at that.
A lot of brunettes.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.390
Where are we headed?

32:24.490 --> 32:27.100
We're gonna continue your education.

32:29.810 --> 32:33.100
- Hi. Is this the meeting?
- Yes yes. Come on in. Hi.

32:33.150 --> 32:38.310
You'd think with two mortgages out
the repo guys staking out my car

32:38.880 --> 32:43.470
my job on the line and my wife
threatening to leave that I'd stop

32:43.500 --> 32:45.760
instead of staying in the chase
doubling down.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.700
It's a disease Leon.

32:47.750 --> 32:51.600
Yeah man. Look admitting
you have a problem is the first step.

32:51.640 --> 32:53.130
Yeah.

32:53.170 --> 32:57.860
I guess I must be doing pretty good
because I've got one big problem.

32:57.890 --> 33:00.680
- Don't worry about it Leon.
- It's OK Leon.

33:00.710 --> 33:03.450
- Hang in there Leon.
- Hey.

33:03.490 --> 33:06.100
My name is Walter
and I'm new to this group...

33:06.130 --> 33:07.200
Hey Walter.

33:07.250 --> 33:11.420
...but I am not new to these meetings.
I've been coming 18 years now.

33:11.450 --> 33:15.590
As a matter of fact friends
this is my 936th consecutive meeting.

33:15.620 --> 33:18.260
Hey man well done.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.180
Well done is right.

33:21.220 --> 33:27.270
And in all that time I haven't once been
to a track or a casino or bet on a game.

33:27.300 --> 33:29.420
Hand to God not a cent.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.860
So I know where you're coming from Leon.

33:32.900 --> 33:36.920
Believe me I know. I heard your story
and it's something I relate to

33:36.970 --> 33:42.080
but I gotta say if I learned anything
it's that gambling is not your problem.

33:42.110 --> 33:43.600
- It's not?
- Not even close.

33:43.640 --> 33:49.580
I don't know how to say this without
sounding rude but you're a lemon Leon.

33:50.000 --> 33:54.170
Like a bad car there is something
inherently defective in you.

33:54.200 --> 33:58.130
And you. And you. And me.
And all of us in this room.

33:58.170 --> 34:02.000
We're all lemons.
We look like everybody else

34:02.040 --> 34:05.700
but what makes us different is our defect.

34:05.750 --> 34:09.710
You see most gamblers
when they go to gamble they go to win.

34:09.739 --> 34:13.110
When we go to gamble
we go to lose subconsciously.

34:13.150 --> 34:18.469
Me I never feel better or more alive
than when they're raking the chips away

34:18.500 --> 34:21.659
not bringing them in and everybody
knows what I'm talking about.

34:21.699 --> 34:25.980
Hell even when we win it's just
a matter of time before we give it all back.

34:26.010 --> 34:29.100
But when we lose
now there's another story when we lose.

34:29.139 --> 34:31.360
I'm talking about the kind of loss

34:31.400 --> 34:34.590
that makes your asshole pucker up
to the size of a decimal point.

34:34.630 --> 34:39.530
You know what I mean? You've just
recreated the worst possible nightmare

34:39.560 --> 34:43.040
this side of malignant cancer
for the 20th goddamn time

34:43.080 --> 34:46.520
and you're standing there
and you suddenly realize:

34:46.550 --> 34:49.030
"Hey I'm still here.

34:49.070 --> 34:51.389
"I'm still breathing.

34:51.429 --> 34:53.670
"I'm still alive. "

34:53.710 --> 34:56.590
Us lemons we fuck shit up
all the time on purpose

34:56.630 --> 35:00.490
because we constantly
need to remind ourselves we're alive.

35:00.520 --> 35:03.520
Leon gambling's not your problem.

35:03.550 --> 35:06.120
It's this fucked-up need

35:06.160 --> 35:08.000
to feel something

35:08.110 --> 35:10.920
to convince yourself you exist.

35:12.900 --> 35:15.300
That's the problem.

35:22.500 --> 35:28.340
Hey you're the guy I see on TV
every weekend selling betting picks.

35:28.370 --> 35:30.940
- So what?
- Oh yeah he's right. This guy...

35:30.970 --> 35:33.090
This guy peddles a tout service on TV.

35:33.130 --> 35:36.220
You read the charter buddy?
We all left our jobs at the door.

35:36.260 --> 35:40.330
Are you gonna throw an ex-alcoholic
bartender out of an AA meeting?

35:40.360 --> 35:42.580
- What?
- You're gonna do that? That's bogus.

35:42.620 --> 35:45.440
- Hey didn't you come in with this jerk?
- Come on.

35:45.470 --> 35:48.050
I don't like the feeling I'm getting.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.610
If you rethink things here's my card.

35:50.650 --> 35:53.620
We're topping 80% this season.
Put it in your wallet.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.600
- You never know when you'll relapse.
- Get out!

35:58.260 --> 36:00.870
What the fuck was that?

36:02.020 --> 36:04.480
- What did you just say?
- That was bullshit.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.860
- You gave your business card...
- No no. You said fuck.

36:07.890 --> 36:12.240
- So what?
- Brandon. So what? That's great man.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.700
It was all worth it just from that one word.

36:14.740 --> 36:20.060
From the one word fuck I could feel
your frustration I could feel your anger.

36:20.090 --> 36:21.410
Man I'm proud of you.

36:31.010 --> 36:33.300
His name is Amir.

36:33.410 --> 36:34.870
He's a dime bettor.

36:35.070 --> 36:36.180
Owns a dry cleaners.

36:36.220 --> 36:39.770
- We got him for the subscription.
- Amir...

36:39.800 --> 36:43.310
He's on line one. Mm ding ding.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.200
Mm.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.760
Good morning.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.930
Walter wanted
your first call to be special.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.750
- OK. Go get 'em tiger.
- You got it.

36:59.890 --> 37:02.400
Me-me-me-me-ow-ow-ow!

37:02.430 --> 37:04.020
Mm-hm.

37:04.060 --> 37:06.930
- Amir my man. John Anthony here.
- Yes. Hello.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.650
Yes, hello to you, sir.
How's your morning?

37:09.690 --> 37:14.600
Mine started off outstanding.
Not as outstanding as I plan my weekend being.

37:14.630 --> 37:17.160
Billy listen.
Thanks for the $15000 FedEx.

37:17.200 --> 37:20.230
It's called a three-team parlay.
It pays six to one.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.520
How much can you lay? 20 grand?

37:22.550 --> 37:24.460
Are you crazy?

37:24.500 --> 37:28.110
No way. Listen
I was betting a thousand a game.

37:28.150 --> 37:32.740
I've got a game that I'm calling
my lock of the decade OK? Texas v OU.

37:32.770 --> 37:35.880
Now Texas is receiving
six points in this game.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.000
- They're gonna win it by two touchdowns.
- Really?

37:39.030 --> 37:41.770
- I like Oklahoma in that game.
- You do?

37:41.810 --> 37:44.320
I shouldn't have called.
Thank you for your time.

37:44.350 --> 37:46.400
Hold on. I've got Vegas on the line.

37:46.510 --> 37:51.160
When we get our 30 grand from last night
then I tell you who he likes next week.

37:51.200 --> 37:55.580
The only thing you gotta know about any
of our clients is that they're all in a hole.

37:55.610 --> 37:57.930
The second they pick up the phone
you got 'em.

37:57.980 --> 38:02.040
I'll tell you once. Green Bay Dallas
Cleveland. 100000 across the board.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.340
Get to the point you're above them.

38:05.380 --> 38:09.240
Let 'em know it. Let 'em feel it.
More John Anthony.

38:09.270 --> 38:10.970
Amir.

38:11.010 --> 38:15.180
- What's your favorite drink my man?
- Favorite drink?

38:15.210 --> 38:17.020
I don't know.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.830
- Piña colada.
- Whoa.

38:20.080 --> 38:24.980
Tomorrow we gotta get you a new drink
but today here's what you're gonna do.

38:25.020 --> 38:28.010
You're gonna go down to your bookie
and lay 20 large on Texas.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.240
Then you'll go home
put on your favorite Hawaiian shirt

38:31.270 --> 38:33.810
and you'll sit back
twirl your little umbrella

38:33.850 --> 38:39.170
after you've made that rum concoction
with the orange slice and the cherry

38:39.200 --> 38:42.410
and you'll watch Texas
rip those Okies a new asshole.

38:42.450 --> 38:45.490
And after you win the 20 grand,
you're gonna call me back

38:45.530 --> 38:48.860
and you're gonna tell me,
"Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

38:48.900 --> 38:52.520
McNeil lost his dog last week
to a hunting accident.

38:52.570 --> 38:56.020
You don't mess with a man
who just lost his dog.

38:56.060 --> 38:59.610
Western Union me ten thou
and let's ride this wave into Sunday.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.690
Denny boy!
I've got something good for this weekend.

39:02.730 --> 39:06.900
Green Bay against Minnesota. I want
you to lay $500 on the Cheeseheads.

39:06.940 --> 39:10.240
Let Stu in on that too
and take care of Mama. Talk to you later.

39:10.270 --> 39:11.390
Tammy who's on four?

39:11.490 --> 39:13.750
Forget the other games you wanted to bet.

39:13.790 --> 39:17.440
Let's throw that 4000 on this 1000
and make it five

39:17.470 --> 39:19.840
take it money line and turn it into 12000.

39:19.870 --> 39:21.920
John Anthony here.

39:22.860 --> 39:26.360
Hello, everybody,
and welcome to "Football Tonight. "

39:26.400 --> 39:30.780
...ten-yard
line, he passes and that's a blind throw...

39:30.820 --> 39:32.720
He's in the end zone!

39:32.770 --> 39:35.790
- Touchdown!
- Yes!

39:35.890 --> 39:40.690
Good ball game.
10-7. Oakland upsets New York.

39:52.680 --> 39:56.120
OK. No that sounds good.
Actually you know what? Monday...

39:56.160 --> 39:58.730
Go Daddy go! Can't you go any faster?

39:58.760 --> 40:01.970
Hey! Ten and two pro football?

40:02.020 --> 40:05.160
85% weekend. You're a mutant!

40:05.200 --> 40:09.110
I definitely want to be there with him.
Put it on a plate.

40:09.140 --> 40:13.020
Oh my God. Thank you. You saved my life.
That is beautiful.

40:13.050 --> 40:15.790
What... What's going on?

40:15.830 --> 40:20.110
Walter's doctor - this is good news -
finally put him on an exercise program.

40:20.140 --> 40:21.630
I want to be there the first time

40:21.670 --> 40:26.260
to make sure the trainer understands
his aversion to consistency. Excuse me.

40:26.290 --> 40:28.410
- Aversion to consistency?
- Mm-hm.

40:28.450 --> 40:31.480
That's Walter. He's always been that way.

40:32.100 --> 40:36.380
- Well that's consistent.
- Well that's true.

40:36.690 --> 40:39.500
You are cute. Take a bite.
Tell me what you think.

40:39.540 --> 40:42.110
Life is fucking good.

40:43.050 --> 40:47.120
So... let's talk about making it better.

40:47.150 --> 40:49.830
Uh-oh. Duck Brandon. Here it comes.

40:51.710 --> 40:55.880
I'm thinking of putting
John Anthony on TV this week.

40:55.910 --> 40:58.490
If you do this from here on out

40:58.540 --> 41:01.090
you're gonna have to eat sleep

41:01.120 --> 41:02.820
drink breathe

41:02.860 --> 41:06.830
talk walk and fart John Anthony.

41:07.450 --> 41:10.210
That's the way it is.
There's no holding back.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.940
You gotta be it
completely or it doesn't work.

41:12.980 --> 41:17.630
That's right and just think it over.
Don't decide now.

41:17.670 --> 41:21.010
It's the only move.
If it means I've gotta act that's cool.

41:21.040 --> 41:24.550
No. No acting. This is living.

41:24.580 --> 41:27.170
You didn't hear me.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.620
From here on out

41:29.660 --> 41:32.750
Brandon Lang and his fettuccine knee

41:32.790 --> 41:38.740
and his self-fucking-pity
is as flat dead as Donald Trump's hair.

41:39.570 --> 41:44.680
And John "I Can Walk On Fucking Water"
Anthony has taken his place.

41:44.710 --> 41:47.390
Now listen
to what he's asking you Brandon.

41:47.420 --> 41:50.000
I'm gonna build an empire around you.

41:50.940 --> 41:53.440
It's gonna cost me.

41:54.170 --> 41:59.280
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Hell yeah I understand.

41:59.310 --> 42:03.240
I'm John fucking Anthony.
I've got a crystal ball.

42:06.160 --> 42:11.580
I am sitting on top of the world,
just rolling along

42:12.210 --> 42:16.760
OK John Anthony breathes.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.510
Now we gotta get a walk and talk.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.180
I'm just asking.

42:21.280 --> 42:24.040
I'm looking for a car
for my friend here.

42:24.080 --> 42:26.810
- Let's see. What's his name?
- John Anthony.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.060
- Mr. Anthony.
- Yes sir.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.150
- Do you have any credit?
- No.

42:31.190 --> 42:35.250
Of course not. I don't know Wally
can you trust him?

42:35.290 --> 42:37.190
With my wife.

42:37.240 --> 42:40.360
- Naked.
- Well in that case the floor is yours.

42:40.400 --> 42:44.220
Glory, hallelujah,
I just phoned the parson

42:44.250 --> 42:47.000
Hey, Pa, get ready to call

42:47.040 --> 42:51.790
Just like Humpty Dumpty
I'm about to fall

42:51.830 --> 42:55.800
- Hey what's "900 King"?
- That's me. John Anthony.

42:55.830 --> 42:58.260
- I don't lose.
- Thank you.

42:58.300 --> 43:02.680
I want you to meet Mr. Miracle
John Anthony. There he is.

43:02.710 --> 43:05.700
It's never ever gonna go down.

43:08.100 --> 43:09.350
Give me all you got.

43:09.390 --> 43:12.340
Singing a song

43:12.380 --> 43:14.880
I'm ready. I'm ready.

43:15.820 --> 43:17.800
A star is born today. How you doing?

43:17.900 --> 43:19.840
- Scared shitless.
- You're sweating.

43:19.890 --> 43:24.470
You'll be all right. Don't worry. You've got
the script. Read off the TelePrompTer.

43:24.510 --> 43:26.310
You've been here before kid.

43:26.350 --> 43:29.170
- Remember football?
- No this is different.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.940
- How's this different?
- No opponent.

43:31.980 --> 43:35.840
- Then you're a lock to win.
- Walter we're ready.

43:35.870 --> 43:39.390
You'll be OK.
Remember stay with the script.

43:39.910 --> 43:41.530
45 seconds.

43:41.580 --> 43:44.760
- That's a lifetime.
- For you boss. This is for you.

43:44.910 --> 43:47.940
Tony, you good?
OK, everybody, we're gonna go.

43:47.970 --> 43:49.670
- We back?
- Places.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.900
- John Anthony huh?
- Yep.

43:52.000 --> 43:55.130
All's I see is another wannabe
in a thousand-dollar suit.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.840
Word to the wise
keep the suit you came in with.

43:57.870 --> 43:59.820
All right Jethro? Good luck to you.

43:59.860 --> 44:02.080
In five four...

44:02.120 --> 44:05.040
- I'll do that.
... three two...

44:05.870 --> 44:08.440
Welcome to this week's Sports Advisors,

44:08.480 --> 44:13.170
America's premier sports-information
program with myself Walter Abrams

44:13.200 --> 44:15.010
Jerry Sykes Chuck Adler

44:15.050 --> 44:18.240
and a truly gifted newcomer
to the Sports Advisorpanel.

44:18.280 --> 44:22.970
I want you to meet him a substantial find
and his name is John Anthony.

44:23.010 --> 44:26.270
OK we're entering week six
in professional football.

44:26.310 --> 44:30.430
This is when the cream rises to the top.
This is when things get hot.

44:30.480 --> 44:34.400
This is oven-mitt time. Am I right?
This is big-time ball season.

44:34.450 --> 44:39.560
So let's get right into it with the wizard
of odds Jerry "The Source" Sykes. Jerry.

44:39.590 --> 44:43.060
Stats records rankings weather

44:43.100 --> 44:45.920
if the goalpost is tilted just a little bit...

44:45.950 --> 44:49.420
The SYKES system
uses 42 proven indexes

44:49.460 --> 44:52.380
to eliminate
the guesswork in sports wagering.

44:52.410 --> 44:55.160
Without my patented
computer-based picks

44:55.200 --> 45:00.410
you got a better shot of having God
show up at your door with nine strippers

45:00.440 --> 45:02.250
a bag of pure Bolivian cocaine

45:02.290 --> 45:05.000
enough Viagra
to make Chuck's head blow off

45:05.030 --> 45:07.250
than picking these things on your own.

45:07.290 --> 45:11.460
You call me absolutely free. I got five
picks this weekend that are incredible.

45:11.500 --> 45:14.970
1-800-238-6648. Give me a call.

45:15.010 --> 45:19.390
How many gamblers did I bail out
last weekend with my game of the year?

45:19.420 --> 45:22.840
A 100-dollar bettor made $10000.

45:22.880 --> 45:26.130
A 500-dollar bettor made $50000.

45:26.170 --> 45:30.340
Well I got six games on Sunday
that I'm releasing absolutely free.

45:30.370 --> 45:34.260
These games are a burial
a blowout a human lock.

45:34.300 --> 45:40.560
You can bet your children's unborn
children's children on these six games

45:40.590 --> 45:43.750
absolutely free!

45:43.790 --> 45:45.840
Whoa whoa I believe I believe!

45:45.880 --> 45:48.960
I believe you're trying to make me deaf.

45:49.010 --> 45:54.060
I've never seen a color on a man like that.
Would you say that's chartreuse?

45:54.090 --> 45:59.120
So Saturday comes before Sunday and
looking at Saturday's college match-ups

45:59.150 --> 46:02.560
is the last but certainly not least
member of the sports advisors.

46:02.590 --> 46:06.380
- And here he is Mr. John Anthony.
- Thank you Walter.

46:06.420 --> 46:11.320
This is John Anthony the million-dollar
man with the billion-dollar plan.

46:11.350 --> 46:13.090
Wall Street to Tokyo to Hollywood

46:13.200 --> 46:15.970
all your big money
is gonna stay and play with me.

46:16.010 --> 46:20.040
That's right. That's why
they call me the million-dollar man.

46:20.080 --> 46:24.360
The million-dollar man the million-dollar
man the million-dollar man.

46:24.390 --> 46:26.750
I can't say that man.

46:27.900 --> 46:30.780
- Uh...
- No no.

46:30.820 --> 46:34.890
Somebody wrote
some very clever stuff for me here

46:34.920 --> 46:37.390
like the million-dollar man.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.160
So let's just call me John.

46:40.210 --> 46:43.500
I played quarterback division one.

46:43.540 --> 46:50.010
Every QB knows that the secret
the key to victory is anticipation.

46:50.040 --> 46:52.820
The ability to see the future and react to it.

46:52.860 --> 46:54.600
Now that is what I do.

46:54.700 --> 46:56.540
And that is the truth.

46:56.580 --> 47:01.790
So I'm not gonna sell you today all right?
I'm just gonna tell you the facts.

47:01.820 --> 47:03.840
For over one year

47:03.880 --> 47:07.630
I have been picking 80% winners.

47:07.840 --> 47:09.770
Unbelievable?

47:09.930 --> 47:11.660
Used to be.

47:11.700 --> 47:14.370
I know the leagues. I know the teams.

47:14.410 --> 47:18.790
I know these players.
I know this wonderful game called football.

47:18.820 --> 47:22.020
Call the number
on the bottom of your screen

47:22.050 --> 47:24.000
and ask for John.

47:24.110 --> 47:26.710
Let's make some money.

47:49.660 --> 47:51.800
Walter.

47:51.850 --> 47:56.850
- I'm not here. Go back to sleep.
- Walter it's four in the morning honey.

47:56.880 --> 47:59.050
What a show.

47:59.090 --> 48:01.190
Come to bed.

48:01.230 --> 48:03.590
Man you should have seen him.

48:03.630 --> 48:06.920
I just sat there and watched him roll.

48:06.970 --> 48:10.260
I swear he made me
want to pick up a phone and call.

48:10.300 --> 48:16.090
I took the sales boys down the Smith and Wo's
to get them primed for the weekend

48:16.120 --> 48:21.880
and Chuck got so drunk he took a swing
at one of the deer heads on the wall.

48:21.910 --> 48:25.010
I don't know what we're gonna do.
I'll hire more guys on Monday.

48:25.040 --> 48:27.620
I got to. I gotta get more phones.

48:27.670 --> 48:30.220
- Everything's amping up.
- Yeah?

48:30.250 --> 48:32.260
This guy I'm telling you

48:32.310 --> 48:36.480
I'm gonna do this whole dot-com thing
around him you know?

48:36.510 --> 48:40.650
I swear if I had me when I was his age...

48:40.680 --> 48:43.110
you know I never had a mentor.

48:43.150 --> 48:46.070
Now I got a protégé. You know?

48:46.100 --> 48:48.850
Someone you hand it all down to.

48:48.890 --> 48:52.540
If anything happens to me he steps in.

48:52.570 --> 48:55.000
He steps in.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.220
Just knowing that
with this thing you know.

48:58.250 --> 49:01.400
- It's like having a son.
- Walter come here.

49:01.430 --> 49:05.050
It's beautiful. It's beautiful beautiful.

49:05.990 --> 49:08.970
- You gotta go back to sleep.
- What are you doing?

49:09.010 --> 49:13.180
- I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for a run.
- No. Walter...

49:13.220 --> 49:16.630
- See the sunrise.
- Come here. Just for a second.

49:16.660 --> 49:18.090
Come here. You're exhausted.

49:18.190 --> 49:23.610
No I'm not. I wanna go do the bridge
thing you know up-up-up Fifth?

49:23.920 --> 49:28.300
Walter I haven't seen you all day.
Just come to bed for one minute.

49:28.340 --> 49:32.680
Just for a minute 'cause you know
I've got the trainer tomorrow.

49:32.720 --> 49:35.670
- The trainer wants me to run.
- I know baby.

49:35.710 --> 49:39.050
- He wants me to run in place you know?
- I know honey.

49:39.080 --> 49:41.510
Run from one place to another place.

49:41.550 --> 49:46.450
No time to sleep just because you're so
exhausted I mean that's no time to sleep.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.220
You're right. No time for sleep.

49:49.260 --> 49:52.600
I'll be right here
when you get back from your run.

49:52.630 --> 49:54.120
That's nice of you.

49:54.170 --> 49:58.440
- I'll be right here right beside you Walter.
- Oh that's nice of you.

49:58.470 --> 50:00.840
I'm not going anywhere.

50:00.870 --> 50:03.200
It's OK.

50:03.240 --> 50:08.450
Just close your eyes
for one second before you go OK?

50:12.210 --> 50:14.560
Know about Stokey
being out against New York?

50:14.600 --> 50:18.360
- A knock would be nice Jerry.
- I'm kinda underwater here man.

50:18.390 --> 50:21.650
- A yes or no would be great.
- No I don't.

50:21.700 --> 50:25.550
If you know something or if you
hear anything you gotta let me know

50:25.590 --> 50:28.070
'cause that's the way we work.

50:28.110 --> 50:30.410
I'll rush right over stat.

50:30.450 --> 50:33.230
I've been here six years.
You've been here one.

50:33.270 --> 50:38.070
What are you doing in here?
Hit the phones man. Do some damage control.

50:38.100 --> 50:40.110
Rewrite that friggin' computer program.

50:40.150 --> 50:42.820
- Hey it was a fucked weekend.
- For some people.

50:42.860 --> 50:46.510
There's a 50-dime bettor
who wants to talk to John Anthony.

50:46.550 --> 50:50.160
- What's his name?
- Carl. He owns McDonald's franchises.

50:50.190 --> 50:52.870
Wait a minute.
I landed that lead. He's my guy.

50:52.910 --> 50:54.610
- Was.
- He's raiding my list now?

50:54.650 --> 50:58.710
Your clients are jumping ship
you lactose-intolerant fuck. Get out.

50:58.750 --> 51:00.280
- Come on.
- Excuse me.

51:01.840 --> 51:04.760
We're home! We're home!
We're home! We're home!

51:07.060 --> 51:10.450
- Can we play princess?
- Oh yes can we play princess.

51:10.920 --> 51:13.830
You go get in your princess outfit.
Everything OK?

51:13.870 --> 51:16.750
I'll put the groceries away
then I'll come and play.

51:16.790 --> 51:19.530
- OK!
- You go ahead.

51:19.570 --> 51:22.180
You got it made. You gotta admit that.

51:23.120 --> 51:25.620
I got a little cab fare.

51:26.560 --> 51:29.370
That... that won't hurt. Hey baby.

51:30.310 --> 51:32.560
I can explain this. It's...

51:32.610 --> 51:35.840
- Gail that's my wife Toni.
- Hi.

51:36.780 --> 51:38.400
- Thank you.
- It's OK really.

51:38.440 --> 51:43.350
- Walter I'll talk to you later OK? Thanks.
- Bye-bye.

51:43.380 --> 51:45.180
What the hell's going on here Walter?

51:45.220 --> 51:49.190
You don't seriously think
I had something to do with that girl now?

51:49.220 --> 51:53.150
I just brought her up here to pay her off.
I got her for John. Come on.

51:53.180 --> 51:55.190
- Don't bullshit me Walter.
- Oh no.

51:55.230 --> 51:58.630
You can't be serious.
You think I slept with this girl?

51:58.680 --> 52:02.320
- Who the hell's John? Who's John?
- John. John Anthony. Ring a bell?

52:02.360 --> 52:04.260
You got Brandon a hooker?

52:04.310 --> 52:10.150
He's working late he's in a new city
he has no friends. Yes I got him a hooker.

52:10.180 --> 52:12.190
Are we gonna have this conversation?

52:12.230 --> 52:15.310
Are you completely
completely clueless Walter?

52:15.670 --> 52:19.110
- Why are you so angry?
- Why am I so angry?

52:19.150 --> 52:22.410
Look at you.
You're jealous. Look at you.

52:22.450 --> 52:27.040
- Oh God. Jealous of what? Of what?
- I don't know. Brandon getting laid.

52:27.660 --> 52:31.630
You really are crazy.
'Cause that sick thought never entered my mind.

52:31.660 --> 52:34.760
Oh that's not where those thoughts enter.

52:34.790 --> 52:37.050
OK I'm done. I'm done. That's it.

52:37.570 --> 52:42.790
You'll be happy to know he didn't
sleep with her. I just paid her for coming.

52:42.820 --> 52:45.180
- Pardon the pun.
- Oh you're hysterical.

52:45.210 --> 52:47.120
- Daddy!
- Oh!

52:47.160 --> 52:48.900
- Daddy!
- Where's my baby?

52:48.940 --> 52:51.020
Look at her! Look at her! Look at her!

52:51.650 --> 52:57.070
Coming up, week-seven predictions
with our new star John Anthony,

52:57.100 --> 53:01.140
who went an amazing 24 and six
in last weekend's games.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.810
- Jerry.
- Yeah.

53:03.850 --> 53:06.350
John's up first tonight.

53:07.290 --> 53:10.790
- What?
- John Anthony is leading off tonight.

53:10.840 --> 53:14.230
- John Anthony's leading off?
- Is there an echo in here?

53:14.280 --> 53:17.470
Engineer! Sound!
Help me I'm hearing everything twice.

53:17.510 --> 53:21.370
Two years I lead off and you bury me
in the deck over a couple lousy weekends?

53:21.400 --> 53:24.710
- This is bullshit Walter.
- ... three two...

53:25.230 --> 53:27.730
Welcome to week seven.

53:28.040 --> 53:30.190
- I'm in the garage.
- Hook it up?

53:30.230 --> 53:32.940
- Yeah. You wanna hear it?
- Man let me hear it.

53:32.970 --> 53:35.860
OK.

53:39.410 --> 53:43.480
- It is the bomb.
- Oh that's what I'm talking about.

53:43.510 --> 53:46.040
That's what I'm talking about my man.

53:46.080 --> 53:48.690
I'm about to head out.
Everything else cool?

53:48.720 --> 53:51.050
Yeah sort of. Did Dad reach you?

53:51.090 --> 53:55.570
- Dad? No. Why?
- Must be out of money. He keeps calling.

53:55.600 --> 53:57.300
He saw you on TV and wants to talk.

53:57.340 --> 54:00.990
I gave him your work number but
he says they won't put him through.

54:01.030 --> 54:03.600
I don't know what that's about.
I'll check into it.

54:04.120 --> 54:06.170
Let's walk.
You could use the exercise.

54:06.210 --> 54:09.500
Stop worrying. We're set for life.
We got Jimmy the Greek here.

54:09.550 --> 54:15.910
He makes Nostra-fucking-damus look like
a novelty act. Brandon to the right.

54:15.940 --> 54:17.430
You love that don't you?

54:17.470 --> 54:20.490
- Let me ask you a question Walter.
- Shoot.

54:21.430 --> 54:23.580
Have you been blocking any of my calls?

54:23.620 --> 54:27.640
Of course. You don't need
distractions right now my boy.

54:27.670 --> 54:31.650
- Lot of crazies out there.
- Does that include my father?

54:32.590 --> 54:36.350
You're asking me
I'm gonna tell you. Yeah.

54:36.380 --> 54:38.430
You son of a bitch.

54:40.310 --> 54:42.040
How long?

54:42.080 --> 54:43.810
- About two weeks.
- Walter.

54:43.850 --> 54:48.130
Come on. Brandon would you
have taken the call if I put it through?

54:48.160 --> 54:51.630
That's not the point. That's not the point.

54:51.670 --> 54:56.260
What is the point? I'd like to know.
What's the story with you and your father?

54:56.290 --> 54:59.390
- You tell me. You seem to know.
- Well I know pieces.

54:59.420 --> 55:01.430
That's about all.

55:01.480 --> 55:05.860
- Hey man I was just trying to spare you.
- Who are you gonna spare me from huh?

55:05.890 --> 55:09.190
He was a drunk left when I was nine.
I couldn't compete with the bottle.

55:09.220 --> 55:13.010
End of fucking story.
So you won't spare me nothing.

55:13.050 --> 55:16.810
If I want to talk to him I will.
Spare me. You fuck.

55:16.840 --> 55:19.060
Is that it? Is that all you got?

55:19.100 --> 55:24.370
I will match my dysfunctional childhood
and Toni's against yours any day.

55:24.630 --> 55:29.630
My father - five foot arms like this.
He had a cock like a Hebrew National.

55:29.660 --> 55:33.870
If I even looked at him the wrong way
he'd smack me like Jake LaMotta.

55:33.910 --> 55:37.870
By the time I was five he yelled at me
so much I thought my name was asshole.

55:37.900 --> 55:39.710
Broke my nose three times.

55:39.750 --> 55:42.100
Toni tell him about you. Come on.

55:42.150 --> 55:45.590
- I didn't have a great childhood either.
- Great?

55:45.620 --> 55:48.150
Tell him about the uncle.

55:48.190 --> 55:49.920
Well I think he gets the idea now.

55:49.970 --> 55:54.240
Come on. Suffice it to say she was
abused by everybody but the family pet.

55:54.270 --> 55:55.870
OK Walter please.

55:55.910 --> 55:59.520
Your father was a drunk.
He was a jerk. So what?

55:59.560 --> 56:03.310
It happens. I'm glad
I blocked those calls. You know why?

56:03.350 --> 56:06.130
You need a new image of a man.
How about me?

56:08.840 --> 56:12.390
- She's laughing.
- 'Cause that's a scary fucking thought.

56:12.420 --> 56:14.220
Hey Brandon listen to me man.

56:14.260 --> 56:18.020
The shit that happened to you
to me to Toni you know what that is?

56:18.050 --> 56:20.060
It's just that shit that happened

56:20.100 --> 56:23.500
because after the therapy
and the psychiatry

56:23.540 --> 56:26.360
and the meetings
you know what it all comes down to?

56:26.390 --> 56:28.510
We're all fucked up.

56:28.550 --> 56:31.160
We are alljust so fucked up.

56:31.570 --> 56:33.620
Now you gotta just say that shit out.

56:33.660 --> 56:36.540
"I am fucked up
and I ain't gonna take it anymore. "

56:36.580 --> 56:40.440
Come on. You too Toni. Let's do it.
All of us. Wallow with me here a minute.

56:40.470 --> 56:44.190
We are so fucked up
we're not gonna take it anymore.

56:44.220 --> 56:47.170
I am so fucked up with all of you

56:47.220 --> 56:50.140
that I'm not gonna take it anymore.

56:50.170 --> 56:51.600
How's that?

56:51.700 --> 56:55.140
Hey! I'm trying to sleep here asshole.

56:55.170 --> 56:57.180
- That you Dad?
- OK Walter.

56:57.230 --> 56:59.210
I'm gonna kick your fucking head in.

56:59.310 --> 57:01.500
- Let's go.
- Don't wait up.

57:02.750 --> 57:05.210
Amir you've got to be kidding me huh?

57:05.260 --> 57:10.370
Are you gonna haggle over 50 grand
after the 250000 I just made you last weekend?

57:10.400 --> 57:14.850
Look don't get me wrong John.
50000 seems slightly steep.

57:14.880 --> 57:17.940
Steep. Amir let's rewind a second.

57:17.980 --> 57:22.570
First time you call... No cuff.
... you're in a hole the size of the Grand Canyon

57:22.600 --> 57:24.820
crying about having
to hock your fiancée's ring.

57:24.860 --> 57:29.450
Now today you're calling me from
a red convertible F1 Ferrari isn't that it?

57:29.480 --> 57:31.910
Right? Candy red?
Yeah you doing the math?

57:31.950 --> 57:34.350
I am. All right? I'm gonna cut you off.

57:34.380 --> 57:36.600
- Oh come on John.
- I'm coming on.

57:36.640 --> 57:40.290
If we keep working together,
I'll charge a 10% aggravation tax.

57:40.320 --> 57:42.230
Get your ass to Western Union tonight.

57:42.280 --> 57:45.190
Wire me 75 grand
and maybe we can kiss and make up.

57:45.230 --> 57:47.340
OK OK John. Now let's...

57:47.380 --> 57:49.430
John Anthony. Talk to me.

57:49.470 --> 57:52.450
- May I please speak to Brandon Lang?
- Mom?

57:52.490 --> 57:56.210
- Hey honey is that you?
- Yeah it's me!

57:56.250 --> 57:59.170
- Are you OK?
- Mom I have never been better.

57:59.480 --> 58:01.630
I'm kicking ass and taking names.

58:01.670 --> 58:05.070
- Did you get the money that I sent you?
- Yeah. That's why I'm...

58:05.110 --> 58:09.070
I talked to Denny. I'm flying you and him
out here next month first-class.

58:09.110 --> 58:11.990
I'll put you up at the Plaza.
You'll meet Toni and Walter.

58:12.030 --> 58:13.830
You are gonna love this joint Ma.

58:13.870 --> 58:19.400
That sounds great honey.
About the money all that money it's-it's too much.

58:19.430 --> 58:21.650
Ma but it-it-it's not too much!

58:21.690 --> 58:25.240
I made that money. I earned that money
every fucking cent of it.

58:25.270 --> 58:28.890
- Listen to you.
- Ma it's just how people talk out here.

58:28.920 --> 58:30.830
Look no cuff.

58:30.870 --> 58:33.120
No cuff Francesco.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.620
Now who's this John Anthony person?

58:35.670 --> 58:39.840
Those checks I've been sending you
those checks you've been cashing

58:39.870 --> 58:41.460
those are from John Anthony.

58:41.510 --> 58:44.700
- And he talks like that?
- Mom they are from me.

58:44.740 --> 58:47.550
- We gotta go to Puerto Rico.
- I gotta put you on hold.

58:47.590 --> 58:49.910
- What's in Puerto Rico?
- CM Novian called.

58:49.950 --> 58:54.190
He lives in Puerto Rico.
He's the biggest sports bettor in the world.

58:54.230 --> 58:58.920
We've hit the jackpot. He wants to sit
and talk in person with John Anthony.

58:58.950 --> 59:02.360
- Got it. How much time we got?
- 45 minutes plane leaves La Guardia.

59:02.390 --> 59:04.760
Whoa pronto OK. Mama?

59:04.790 --> 59:07.370
Mom? Ma?

59:10.080 --> 59:12.690
My mom just hung up on me. Um...

59:13.730 --> 59:18.890
- What do you know about him?
- Not much but he's a world-class prick.

59:18.920 --> 59:24.050
Wouldn't return my call. Treated me
worse than my Hong Kong tailor.

59:24.080 --> 59:26.550
You know how long
I've been trying to bag this guy?

59:26.590 --> 59:29.170
Have you any idea
what this thing is worth?

59:29.210 --> 59:32.260
Nope but I want a bonus
if we pull this off.

59:32.300 --> 59:35.310
- No "if. " It's only "when. "
- I got you.

59:35.340 --> 59:38.230
You understand?
Remember he called us.

59:38.440 --> 59:40.590
- You hooked him.
- Mm-hm.

59:40.630 --> 59:43.720
- Know that. Sweat that.
- You got it.

59:43.760 --> 59:48.350
Relax my man.
I'll get in character in the car huh?

59:48.380 --> 59:50.230
Oh fuck!

59:51.480 --> 59:54.190
Whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

59:54.220 --> 59:57.380
Hey! Uh-oh. Easy baby. Easy easy.

59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.550
Is it your heart?
Where's your vial? Easy easy.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:05.350
Somebody get a doctor! Get me a doctor
and get me some water now.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.160
Here we are. Hang on baby.
Yeah breathe it out.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.440
Here's one two. Yeah yeah yeah
you suck on them. Suck on them man.

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:14.520
Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes sir.

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:16.780
Easy easy easy.

01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:18.590
- Yeah baby.
- Brandon?

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:20.420
- Yeah? I'm here.
- You love me?

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:24.640
Shh. Oh I love you. You know I love you.
Shh. You ain't going nowhere.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:29.120
Somebody get some help!
Get me some water now!

01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:30.060
Shh.

01:00:30.160 --> 01:00:34.020
- Brandon?
- Yeah? Talk to me my man. Come on.

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:37.520
Would you love me...

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:39.970
if this was a joke?

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.370
I'm OK.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:46.010
I was just practicing. It's OK.

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.160
It's OK.

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:52.330
Look at me. I'm all right. Oh I got a crowd.

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:56.230
Little indigestion.
Too many peanuts on the plane. I'm OK.

01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:00.090
Thank you for your concern.
He's had a little problem. Whoa.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.010
Don't-don't-don't-don't you do that to me.

01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.980
- Walter that's pushing it too far.
- Now you listen to me.

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:11.460
Now you pay attention to me right now.
There's no such thing as too far.

01:01:11.490 --> 01:01:14.960
Understand?
You push everything as far as you can.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.860
You push and you push and you push
until it starts pushing back

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.800
and then you push some goddamn more.

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:25.020
Remember that
when you're with this guy today.

01:01:25.050 --> 01:01:26.160
OK?

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:33.250
Oh man. If I start to die again
forget the hospital I wanna croak here.

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:39.930
- Walter.
- Mr. Novian it's an honor. My associate...

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:42.490
- John Anthony.
- How are you?

01:01:42.530 --> 01:01:45.040
These sports services of yours...

01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.790
complete fucking scam huh?

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:55.880
I hear your boy here's having quite a season.
What's your system Walter?

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:59.430
- System?
- Let's start with how much you bet.

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:01.830
Million a game across the board.

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:05.330
OK is that the most we're working with?

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:11.000
It depends. Shit Benny check your wallet.
See if you have any cash.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.030
Maybe he'll talk about the weekend.
How do you feel about it?

01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:17.110
- Do you rent that yacht?
- No no. I own it.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:20.140
Well that's how I feel about this weekend.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:24.450
And I'm not being cocky. I'm talking
straight commerce with you Mr. Novian.

01:02:24.490 --> 01:02:28.830
- I didn't come down here to bullshit you.
- Wow you got steamed.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.650
Or maybe
a little inside information maybe?

01:02:33.210 --> 01:02:35.990
I know these teams
better than they know themselves.

01:02:36.030 --> 01:02:39.680
I'm going 12 for 12 this weekend
including the Monday-night parlay.

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.870
Wow. Should we believe him?

01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:45.310
- What do you think?
- I don't believe him.

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.460
You cannot afford not to.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:50.420
- No I can afford.
- Can you?

01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:53.860
Honest question Mr. Novian. Can you?

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:56.110
Hell can anyone for that matter

01:02:56.160 --> 01:03:00.220
afford to lose as much
as a man like you needs to bet

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:02.410
to actually feel a win?

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.690
Winning's a funny thing.

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:12.110
It's one of those rare commodities
that money cannot buy until you called me.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:15.550
I didn't call you. I called your boss.

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.490
And he called me.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:23.690
The price is $250000 up-front
plus 10% of every game you win.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.400
Well that's wild.

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:31.610
I never paid up-front before did I?

01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.450
We've never charged it before.

01:03:33.490 --> 01:03:38.180
Considering whose picks you're getting
and the amount of money you're betting

01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:40.850
250's a bargain. You know it and I know it.

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:45.900
If you want this weekend's winners
that's my offer.

01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.440
You can take it or leave it.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.120
Let's step outside.

01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:06.340
Come in.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:10.920
- They need it Mr. Anthony.
- What's your mother's name Mitchell?

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:11.970
Sheila.

01:04:12.070 --> 01:04:14.990
- What street did you grow up on?
- Atlantic Avenue.

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.910
- Who do you like Monday night?
- Oh I don't know.

01:04:17.940 --> 01:04:20.370
- Pick one.
- Well that's your job.

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:24.270
I'll do your job tomorrow.
Today you do mine. Who do you like?

01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.730
- What are you talking about?
- Mitchie.

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:31.470
Seattle v New Orleans.
Stop stalling. Who do you like?

01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:37.310
I don't know. I mean
I guess I like Seattle plus the two points.

01:04:38.350 --> 01:04:42.000
- Over or under?
- No you can't... Don't... You can't do that.

01:04:42.030 --> 01:04:46.480
No I can do this.
Over or under? It's 44 points. Come on.

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:48.680
Um...

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.820
Over.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:53.320
Seattle in the over. Nice.

01:04:53.370 --> 01:04:56.600
I won't hand that in.
A million dollars are riding on that game.

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:59.270
Oh there's a whole lot more than that.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:04.210
We all know I can pick. Today I'm picking you.
The outcome will be the same.

01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:09.950
- OK. And... what if I'm wrong?
- There's no "if. "

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.430
Are we running to the field goal?
We don't need a field goal.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.410
We need a touchdown.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.870
Oh that's OK. That's OK.

01:05:18.910 --> 01:05:21.260
They score we win. Come on come on.

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:23.610
They score we win. They score we win.

01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:26.730
They score we win. They score we win.

01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:28.300
They score we win.

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:31.390
...first down on the sixth.
Touchdown!

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:35.600
Yes! We won! We won!
A hundred fucking percent!

01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.520
A hundred fucking percent!

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:42.690
A hundred fucking percent! A hundred...

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.430
It was like he mesmerized me a little bit.

01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:53.850
Like Spock or something I visualized it.
Seattle and the over and he wrote it down.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:57.290
- He said picking me was like him doing it.
- How long have you been here?

01:05:59.370 --> 01:06:02.980
It's not unusual to go out at any time

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.050
Congratulations Brandon
or should I say John?

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:09.030
Either way it's amazing.
I am very impressed.

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:12.770
Are you kidding me? Letting salesmen
make your picks? That's balls.

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:16.480
You better get over there and
collect some of that cash right now.

01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:19.500
The way you're picking
you'll need some for a rainy day.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:21.750
Enjoy it while it lasts.

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.030
Gambling gods are a fickle bunch.
So easily offended.

01:06:26.070 --> 01:06:30.760
There might be businesses you can make
over two million dollars in a weekend...

01:06:30.790 --> 01:06:33.120
- Thanks for looking after me.
- All right.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.970
...but will somebody tell me
somebody please tell me

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.770
where else are you gonna
have this much fucking fun?

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.010
You the man! You the man big Papa!

01:06:44.530 --> 01:06:47.820
I love you forever.

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:52.450
Let me ask you something.
How much of that do-re-mi be for moi?

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:57.870
Well how about a one
with five zeros behind it.

01:06:57.910 --> 01:06:59.860
- A hundred thousand?
- Yeah.

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.480
On two mill?

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:04.400
- You be working out of my shop.
- Yes sir I am.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.620
- Look around you.
- This is your place Walter's shop.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.810
I understand that.
I'm just saying feed the horse baby.

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.370
- Maybe 10%.
- 10%?

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:17.650
That what you're thinking?
That's a beautiful thought. Forget it.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:23.320
Walter we were starting to roll here.
And we got Novian. We got the 250 grand...

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:26.300
I wanna tell you something now OK?
I'm gonna say it only once.

01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:30.510
If you want something more from me
than a gesundheit after a sneeze

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:32.250
you have to do more than this shit.

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:34.840
You understand?
You're gonna have to earn it.

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:37.250
Once you earn it
you'll have to fight me for it.

01:07:37.290 --> 01:07:42.300
You'll have to challenge me.
You'll have to rip it out of my fucking talons.

01:07:42.330 --> 01:07:46.990
That's how you get ahead with me.
Now John Anthony would know that see?

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:50.220
As a matter of fact
next time you come to me with this shit

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:52.000
you come as John Anthony.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:54.290
I ain't talking money with you.

01:08:00.440 --> 01:08:02.480
Hey big winner huh?

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:04.510
How you feeling?

01:08:04.610 --> 01:08:07.380
Winning. Winning.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.140
Dance with me.

01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.960
Oh!

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:20.359
- You know I gotta dance with you more.
- You do.

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:23.590
- Listen. I'm thinking of buying a plane.
- Oh yeah.

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:25.640
Yeah. You know...

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:30.160
Don't laugh. A big one.
One of them G... G somethings.

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:36.840
I saw this house in the Bahamas for sale.
I mean talk about an investment.

01:08:36.870 --> 01:08:40.490
In case anything should happen to me
I mean you and Julia...

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:43.510
Shh! I don't wanna hear that Walter.
Stop that.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:46.700
Why don't we go down and check it out?

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.870
Just you and me barefoot in the sand.

01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:54.979
Just tell me you're not... gambling Walter.

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.340
Oh.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.819
18 years I'm straight OK?
That shit's over.

01:09:01.859 --> 01:09:05.300
It's never over.
You know that Walter. It's never over.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:08.180
How about a truth serum... in the veins?

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:12.500
Baby we just made two million dollars.
I wanna just celebrate with my wife.

01:09:12.529 --> 01:09:15.000
I want to enjoy a dance.
Can I do it just once?

01:09:15.029 --> 01:09:16.880
Walter.

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:30.439
Alexandria? Hey, it's Brandon.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:33.979
Yeah. Yeah listen
I happen to be in the neighborhood.

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:38.149
You have got a Doberman for a doorman.

01:09:39.399 --> 01:09:44.050
- Hi Alexandria.
- What are you doing here?

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:48.640
What do you say we go out
for a late-night dinner right now?

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.859
Have a couple killer bottles of wine
go back to that place where we first met...

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.420
Hm?

01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:00.050
Are you out of your mind?
I live in this building asshole. This is home.

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.760
I don't appreciate
you stopping by without calling.

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:05.950
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:09.230
- What's gotten into you?
- I'll make this shit real clear

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:11.100
so this doesn't happen again.

01:10:11.210 --> 01:10:13.920
You meant 5000 bucks.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:16.900
Your friend set it up.

01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:20.590
The world still is the same

01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.780
You never change it

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:29.670
As sure as the stars shine above

01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.140
Well, you're nobody

01:10:35.170 --> 01:10:38.840
Till somebody loves you

01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:42.550
So find yourself

01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:46.250
Somebody to love

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.590
- You know what time it is?
- It is 8:37 in the a. m.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.630
Wrong. It's time to press my man.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:11:00.220
We're gonna yank out all the stops.
When you're winning you press.

01:11:00.250 --> 01:11:03.720
You don't rest on your laurels.
What are you doing?

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.830
I've got a 10:30 tee time at Wingfoot
with a client - that Howell guy.

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:09.980
So don't call me unless the lines change.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:15.550
The salmon are running my man.
You gotta stay here. Gotta field phone calls.

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.590
You can't go out playing golf having fun.

01:11:17.630 --> 01:11:20.510
Fun? Señor you have obviously
never played Wingfoot.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:24.580
Come on stop playing around here.
Let's go. You got work to do this week.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:29.730
I'm not asking you if I can leave Walter.
I'm telling you that's how it is. All right?

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:32.820
You want my picks I can give you those.

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:35.940
Washington minus eight against Miami
Washington.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.970
Saint-Louis KC.
Out of your mind? Las Vegas.

01:11:39.010 --> 01:11:42.350
You're gonna start picking
on Tuesday for the weekend huh?

01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:46.210
Philadelphia. I love it. Look at that. Cinci.

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:51.470
We'll be advising in the neighborhood
of 20 million dollars this week.

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:55.900
That's a nice neighborhood.
We should be doing double that by week ten.

01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:59.350
I see. You're gonna make the picks.
No study no analysis.

01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:01.180
You're just gonna pick 'em.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.480
Locked in Walter. I don't really need it.

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:07.170
Look at that. You've got to be kidding me.
Vegas Monday night.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.790
There's my picks for this week.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.210
Now if you want next week's picks
I can give you those by Friday.

01:12:13.250 --> 01:12:16.090
- If you wanna join us you can.
- No I'm getting the drift.

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:19.680
Tell you what. We'll keep these on ice
and go over 'em tomorrow.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:22.290
- I won't be in tomorrow.
- Well then the next day!

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:25.420
Uh we'll talk about it.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:28.960
Hey Brandon!

01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:30.800
- Toni!
- Hey!

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.340
- Where you headed?
- Some of us have to work.

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:36.640
- Oh oh oh. There we go.
- Baby.

01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:39.870
- Hey you look great.
- Nice ride.

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:43.660
- "900 K-I-N-G." Did you see the plates?
- Yes I did.

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.640
- You feel that? You feel that?
- Don't. Slow down Brandon.

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:02.850
- Oh this car was made to go fast.
- No. Not with me in it. Slow down.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.730
Loosen up will you? Hey.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.610
Let me ask you a question.

01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:10.840
When you're not at the salon
or running Julia to play dates

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:16.620
or keeping Walter in line which I know
is a full-time job what do you do for you?

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:20.680
- I stay busy. You're gonna turn here so...
- That's not what I asked.

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.270
What do you do for you for Toni?

01:13:27.150 --> 01:13:30.760
I was a junkie Brandon. OK?

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:34.400
So every day I get up and I wonder
"Is this the day?

01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:38.140
"Is this the day I slip
end up back on the street?"

01:13:38.170 --> 01:13:41.850
Just keeping it all on track
that's what I do for me.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.940
Well that's not living Toni.
That is not living.

01:13:44.980 --> 01:13:49.260
That is maintaining.
That's cashing in. That is not living.

01:13:49.670 --> 01:13:51.400
What the hell does that mean?

01:13:51.450 --> 01:13:54.890
Are we talking perfection?
You wanna talk perfection?

01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:57.140
No. Nobody's perfect.

01:13:57.180 --> 01:14:01.870
Oh except for me last weekend
going 14 and 0 huh?

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:11.570
- This is your stop.
- Well thanks for the ride... John.

01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:23.770
In other action, Washington melted down
in Miami, losing 24 to 12.

01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:26.130
Saint-Louis shocked KC 34-14,

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.610
and Philadelphia
smacked Pittsburgh 23-10.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.050
- I'm gonna go work out.
- No you're not.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.200
There's half a dozen games left here.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:40.250
I want you to watch every second
of every minute of every one of them.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.810
All right so sit down.

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.320
Oakland is having a miserable time.

01:14:44.350 --> 01:14:46.920
Berman.

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:50.740
You know how you go
three and 11 don't you?

01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:54.950
You go three and 11 when
you make Sunday's picks on Tuesday.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:57.990
'Cause it rained in Cincinnati on Saturday.

01:14:58.030 --> 01:15:00.850
Two starting quarterbacks
never got to play.

01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:04.340
That's how you go three and 11.
You're a handicapper not a psychic.

01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:07.740
- We still got Monday and the parlay.
- Fuck Monday and the parlay.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:11.740
This isn't about that. This is about me.
It's about the commission thing.

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:15.080
- Oh no. I don't know.
- Oh don't bullshit me. Come on.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:19.250
All right listen.
I'm gonna bump you. 10%. OK?

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:21.290
You earned it.

01:15:21.330 --> 01:15:26.860
This is dangerous territory we're getting into.
You understand? But I'll bump you.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.010
Now talk to me about Monday night

01:15:29.050 --> 01:15:33.640
because everyone I mean everyone
will double down after the hole you put 'em in.

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:35.830
- It's fine.
- You'd bet your mother's house?

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.870
- I don't bet Walter.
- If you did?

01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:41.360
- I like the pick Walter.
- On your mother's house or not?

01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:43.190
With my mother in it.

01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:47.400
Another Monday-night
thriller comes down to the final seconds.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.530
Carolina has to get at least
into field-goal range here.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:52.310
High snap, pulled down nicely.

01:15:52.410 --> 01:15:54.810
And a beautiful punt by Feuderday.

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:57.160
He drills it. Thompson has to retreat.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:16:01.270
And Thompson dropped the ball. The ball
is on the turt, and the scramble is on.

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.630
It's heading toward the Carolina goal line.

01:16:03.670 --> 01:16:07.430
A couple of guysjump on it.
It might be changing hands right now.

01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:09.090
Fuck!

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:13.060
The call goes to Cleveland.
Carolina won't have a shot...

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:15.000
Fuck!

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:21.090
This one is over.
An unbelievable finish.

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:28.070
You don't switch to
a three-four halfway through the season.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.430
No, what defense
are they running in practice?

01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:34.230
Jones is on the field. Sunday.
We're still leaning heavy on the overs.

01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.790
Thank you, thank you, sir.

01:16:35.890 --> 01:16:37.730
You are the man. I'll talk to you...

01:16:37.770 --> 01:16:43.300
His improvement's been great but he got
out of surgery two and half weeks ago.

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:46.700
I know he's had a good week of practice
but his knee's swollen.

01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:50.080
Help me out. Game-time decision.
That's what coach always says.

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:54.210
Are we talking game-time probable huh?
Or doubtful?

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:57.690
Tell me. You're going into...
It's raining it's snowing.

01:16:57.720 --> 01:17:00.200
Can his knee hold up in that?

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.710
Will the doc let him play?

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.150
Yes he is a gamer. Thank you.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.220
I can read between the lines. You got it.

01:17:08.250 --> 01:17:11.040
Unbelievable! Yee-ha!

01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:14.580
Takes the snap, drops the throw.

01:17:22.190 --> 01:17:24.590
Whoa!

01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:27.300
Hell of a swing.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.850
Sport of kings right?

01:17:31.890 --> 01:17:35.440
- No no. That's horse racing.
- What are you doing here?

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:38.880
- Southie told me where I could find you.
- Yep.

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:41.800
I wanted to get out. Clear my head.

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:44.780
So talk to me. How'd we do?

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:47.810
- You haven't seen the scores?
- Nope.

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:53.060
That's how I wanted it.
Make my picks get the results later.

01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:59.280
- Well... highest sales volume ever.
- Yeah?

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:03.380
- Take a guess how we did.
- I think we kicked ass.

01:18:04.220 --> 01:18:08.390
- It was amazing.
- Yeah last week was nothing Walter.

01:18:09.850 --> 01:18:15.380
You're right. It was nothing
compared to what we lost today.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.190
What'd I go?

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.090
I got an idea. Why don't I give you
a glimpse of what happened

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:26.430
and then you take a stab
on how you went?

01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:27.990
Just give me the numbers.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.120
You don't wanna play?
Too bad. Would've been fun.

01:18:31.150 --> 01:18:33.170
Grown men crying on the phone.

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:35.460
Their wives screaming in the background.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.630
Three salespeople quit -
couldn't take the pressure.

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.200
- Fuck.
- No no no.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.050
You lose ten out of 12
"fuck" doesn't quite cover it.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:48.640
You know what would be more appropriate?
"Holy Fucking Shit!"

01:18:48.670 --> 01:18:52.810
Or "Jesus Fucking Christ!"

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:56.110
- I got the picture Walter.
- You're right.

01:18:56.150 --> 01:19:00.220
You go two for 12
on our highest volume weekend ever

01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.470
and...

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:04.350
what's left to say?

01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:07.470
Except maybe
we keep the phone number

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.640
only we switch it over
to a fucking suicide hotline.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.290
Tomorrow morning Brandon
bright and early

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:17.210
we start all over again.

01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:37.440
- Mr. Novian wants to see you.
- Argh!

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.410
Tell him... to call me. Argh!

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.660
You tell him.

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:48.500
- I didn't recognize you without the suit.
- This is my time off.

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:51.000
If you want to talk make an appointment.

01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:53.820
Or should I call you Brandon?

01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:57.670
Someone costs you 30 mill
you do research right?

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.610
I mean I got more than your name now.

01:19:59.660 --> 01:20:03.830
I know where you live where you're from
where your family lives.

01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:06.600
Hey your mother
there's a sweet lady man.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:12.060
I just come from Vegas. Dealt me
three blackjacks in a row. She's a good woman.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:17.800
Where's the cocky motherfucker
who come to my house? Where's John?

01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:20.930
If you don't like my picks
use somebody else.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:29.170
Come here. It's all right. It's all right.

01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:35.740
I just come for an apology. That's it.
Just look me in the eye and say you're sorry.

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:39.590
I mean say it so as to make me
believe you mean it. Come on.

01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.410
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck that. I'm not going to accept that.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.540
Come on one more time. I'm sorry. Hey?

01:20:47.210 --> 01:20:50.440
- I'm sorry.
- You motherfucker. You're not even close.

01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:52.900
You're not even close.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.130
No it's not gonna work.
It's not gonna work.

01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:59.510
I'm gonna get my satisfaction.
I'm gonna get something I want.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:01.910
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.
No-no-no.

01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.580
What do you mean "No-no-no"?

01:21:04.620 --> 01:21:07.230
No look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:21:07.260 --> 01:21:09.110
- Brandon?
- OK.

01:21:09.630 --> 01:21:10.630
I'm sorry.

01:21:10.670 --> 01:21:14.110
Come on you're not gonna tell me
you're scared of dying are you?

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.360
Mr. Novian it was a bad fucking weekend.

01:21:16.410 --> 01:21:18.910
- It was a bad weekend?
- Yeah yeah. Yes yes.

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:22.660
Well let's make it a fun day.

01:21:22.690 --> 01:21:24.450
Come here.

01:21:24.490 --> 01:21:26.210
Oh yeah.

01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:28.710
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:30.590
- Come here.
- Argh!

01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:32.460
There.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.200
- Walter.
- I'm busy.

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:44.040
Listen I think I should lead off tonight.
I got some really strong stuff man.

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:46.190
Jerry you got a good hole. Stay in it.

01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:49.360
I went eight for 12 last week.
I'm hot. I'm feeling it.

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.190
You had one good weekend.

01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:54.570
What do you mean?
SYKES system revolutionized this industry.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.030
Am I wood?

01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:59.990
Where's my fucking ad? I...

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.870
- Take a hike.
- What?

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:05.000
- You're fired.
- I'm not fired.

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:07.610
- You're out of here.
- You need me.

01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:10.110
Get outta here you cut-rate parasite.

01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:12.050
In six years my worst weekend

01:22:12.090 --> 01:22:15.590
was never as bad
as any of this guy's last three weeks.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.910
You're not hearing me.
You don't work for me anymore. It's over.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.060
- What the hell are you doing Walter?
- Oh!

01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:25.400
Am I doing something wrong?
Am I not communicating? Is that it?

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.920
Am I not projecting enough?
He doesn't understand. You all know what I just did.

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:32.800
- I fired you!
- Come on this is me! All right?

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:37.010
I've been here for you. I'm consistent
and you know it. The other guys fuck 'em.

01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:41.390
- They come they go. I'm the guy.
- No they don't. Not him.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.750
That's true talent! Get it?

01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:48.170
You can't see it I can't explain it to you.
That's why you're fired.

01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:49.900
Think about what you're doing.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:53.800
You couldn't pick your nose without
a fucking computer. You're small.

01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:56.410
- You belong in a can.
- You've lost it!

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.450
You don't touch him.

01:22:58.490 --> 01:23:03.080
Now why don't you have
some self-respect and leave?

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.170
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Maybe I am.

01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:12.630
Maybe I am.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:15.070
Good luck!

01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:19.930
Asshole.

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:23.520
Doesn't realize I'm trying
to build an empire around you.

01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:25.880
I hope you do.

01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:30.510
OK everyone. Let's go. Back to work.
Big playoff weekend coming. Chop-chop.

01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:04.980
Hey Toni. This is not a good time.

01:24:05.020 --> 01:24:09.300
I know but Brandon
I need to talk to you. It's important.

01:24:11.070 --> 01:24:16.180
- Not right now.
- Brandon you have to... you have to go.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.230
No I gotta... get back on track.

01:24:22.260 --> 01:24:24.380
It won't matter.

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.010
You could win 100 games in a row
and it won't be enough. It'll never be enough.

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:32.240
He will ride you into the ground.

01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:35.270
I'll figure it out.

01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.140
No.

01:24:38.710 --> 01:24:40.900
Brandon please.

01:25:11.450 --> 01:25:13.290
John Anthony.

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:16.870
- I'm wiped out, John.
- Amir.

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.470
My business my house

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.440
my credit... everything.

01:25:23.470 --> 01:25:25.070
Amir?

01:25:25.110 --> 01:25:30.120
It's gonna be OK all right?
We're gonna get back on track this weekend.

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:33.240
- You hear me?
- Still you talk like this.

01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:35.390
Who the fuck are you?

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:39.250
Like this is some kind of game.
You ruined me!

01:25:39.290 --> 01:25:44.190
I was betting a few thousand a Sunday
when I called you, but you pushed me.

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:47.220
Every call, all the time, with your talk.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:51.810
I lost 380,000 this weekend.

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:55.350
I was going to get married.

01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:59.840
I had a life!

01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:04.740
Oh, no words now, huh?

01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:07.970
No more money to squeeze
so you shut up.

01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.770
How do you fucking live with yourself?

01:26:19.130 --> 01:26:21.630
Come on.

01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:33.310
That's it!

01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:35.250
Coming Walter!

01:26:35.290 --> 01:26:38.210
I know what the problem is.

01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:40.710
- He's OK.
- I'll come back later.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.650
No no stick around. Stay stay.

01:26:42.690 --> 01:26:46.400
These guys are finished.
You guys want anything before you go?

01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:50.100
Something to eat?
You leave the way you came in fellas. Thank you.

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:52.500
Shut the door.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:57.980
- Who's that?
- We need a Bat Light or something.

01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:02.400
One of them signals you shoot up
into the clouds so that no matter where you are

01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:05.070
you just look up you say
"Hey Walter needs me. "

01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:08.030
Because I must've beeped you
a hundred fucking times.

01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:11.370
- Who were they man?
- The Salvation Army.

01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:15.020
How does someone go one for eight?

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.510
A fucking monkey tossing darts
could do better than that.

01:27:19.540 --> 01:27:22.740
- What's with all the money Walter?
- I got a plan.

01:27:22.770 --> 01:27:24.890
We take your picks
we reverse everything.

01:27:24.930 --> 01:27:28.890
Like one of them Twilight Zone
episodes where everything is opposite.

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.930
You say black we go white.

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:34.370
- How much is that?
- Peanuts.

01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.610
275000. That's how desperate I am.

01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:40.740
- What happened to the two mill?
- Two mill?

01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:45.470
Man I was carrying twice that in red ink
before you even showed up.

01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.180
Look around. Everything you see
is smoke and mirrors.

01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:50.960
I got three mortgages on this house.

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.860
What do you wanna know?
I'm gambling again!

01:27:58.090 --> 01:28:00.700
To cover my losses
I just got a loan from a guy

01:28:00.730 --> 01:28:03.300
who works out of a bar
on 106th and Broadway.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.270
Trouble with me is I start
betting you heavy after you went 100%

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:10.560
and I rode you right into the fucking toilet.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:15.090
I do know what the problem is man.
We're gonna take care of all this shit.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.440
Check this out man. I'm Brandon Lang.

01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:20.050
I'm the kid who played sports
and loved sports.

01:28:20.090 --> 01:28:23.530
I'm the kid who can pick winners.
I'm the kid you called in Vegas.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.790
Along the way I lost something in here.

01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:30.000
I don't know what but I know I gotta
go back to being me to being Brandon.

01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:33.750
- If I get back to being Brandon...
- You can pick again. Of course.

01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:37.510
- Forget John Anthony. Burn the suits.
- Mm-hm.

01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.430
My fault. I fucked with you.

01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:45.600
- Only two games. Two over-unders.
- That's right.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:51.380
If I get you to crunch the numbers
sprinkle a little Brandon magic over it.

01:28:51.410 --> 01:28:54.250
We get the salespeople
burning up the phones...

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:57.110
- Come Monday we go four for four.
- Four for four.

01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.950
- That's something.
- How's that sound?

01:28:58.990 --> 01:29:02.950
- This is important you know?
- I know it is. Pressure doesn't help.

01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:05.770
Let's go eat something.
Let's go to Smith and Wo's.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:08.540
Brandon's gotta stay
and do some homework.

01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:11.290
The Brandon thing.
You see I'm forgetting.

01:29:20.890 --> 01:29:23.600
Two games. Two games. Two games.

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:30.380
Two games. Two games. Two games.

01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:31.730
Hey what... Ho!

01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:38.090
People living in the zone.
What does that mean?

01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.770
His hair was all over.

01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:16.470
Brandon made these picks?

01:30:16.570 --> 01:30:18.970
You're looking at him.

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.140
New York in the under.
Tennessee in the over.

01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:25.540
Sell 'em hard.

01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:29.810
Hello and welcome. The Conference
Championship game is underway.

01:30:29.850 --> 01:30:32.590
- Can I watch Daddy?
- Come to Daddy.

01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:35.300
My angel. I need you to root for me.

01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:39.830
You see that team? Those are the bad guys.
We don't want them. That's Atlanta.

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:42.860
We want the good guys the blue team.
That's New York.

01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:45.870
And New York has gotta win
by more than five points

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:48.330
only you gotta root for a low score OK?

01:30:48.380 --> 01:30:52.860
Because both teams together
have to make less than 42 points total.

01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:56.820
All right so it's New York
in under 42 points.

01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:58.660
All right?

01:30:58.700 --> 01:31:02.140
Smith is wide.
Cohn changing the play, audible lies.

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.540
At the line of scrimmage.
He doesn't like the defense.

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:09.020
Robinson in motion to the left.
Jones alone in the backfield.

01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:11.900
Cohn back to passer. He's got the rookie.

01:31:11.940 --> 01:31:14.450
- Anderson is in the middle...
- Go go go!

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.800
- In the end zone.
- Yeah!

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:20.490
Touchdown, New York,
and they take the early lead.

01:31:20.530 --> 01:31:22.540
Midway through the second quarter now.

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:26.960
Atlanta down 10-0, but they're making
their first serious threat of the game.

01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:29.110
- Thomas, delay action...
- Get him!

01:31:29.150 --> 01:31:31.920
Over the top.
Touchdown, Atlanta!

01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:36.760
10-7 and New York is on the move.
Cohn now back to throw.

01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:38.910
He's over he's over he's over.

01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:42.600
Simpson's got it!
He fumbles it. He's in the end zone!

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:46.770
That's a touchdown!
It's now 17-7 New York.

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:48.920
- And we'll be right back.
- Whoo!

01:31:48.960 --> 01:31:51.730
Less than a minute to go.
New York seconds away

01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:54.450
from making their third trip
to the big game.

01:31:54.490 --> 01:31:59.500
A New York score here and this game
is all but over. He's got Simpson.

01:31:59.530 --> 01:32:02.370
Touchdown, New York!

01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:06.340
24-14. Now it is out of reach.

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:10.970
New York ready to take on the winner
of our next game, KC against Tennessee.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:13.640
The boy is back. First of two baby!

01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:16.910
Atlanta may just take a knee here.

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:18.540
Way to do it!

01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.650
Why not throw it long?
He puts it up for grabs. It's a Hail Mary.

01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.520
- Knock it down! Knock it down!
- Oh no.

01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:28.380
A wall of blue shirts...

01:32:28.410 --> 01:32:30.420
Come on! No!

01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:34.950
It is tipped in the air.
It's still loose. It is bouncing all around.

01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:38.300
- Jesus!
- Peterson comes down.

01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:41.580
- He's at the 20.
- Come on!

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:46.730
Across the ten. Mackey
dives to keep him out of the end zone.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.300
No!

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.800
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:54.760
New York wins it 24-21.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.070
That wraps up
our doubleheader playoff coverage,

01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:10.610
as Kansas City tops Tennessee 33 to 13

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.950
and heads for Super Forty.

01:33:13.980 --> 01:33:16.350
I'm finished Walter.

01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:19.480
Oh that's great to hear.

01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:21.420
Yeah.

01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:23.750
- I'm done man.
- Yeah?

01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:25.690
I don't eat.

01:33:25.730 --> 01:33:28.300
I'm not sleeping.

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:32.090
What you saying? You got insomnia
indigestion you're gonna quit?

01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:34.450
Hail Mary pass. These things happen.

01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:38.140
Listen to me man.
I'm telling you. It's over.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:43.460
What use is John Anthony
gonna be to you now anyway huh?

01:33:43.490 --> 01:33:45.300
With the streak he's been on?

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.150
Come on.
I won't listen to this defeatist bullshit.

01:33:48.190 --> 01:33:51.030
Hot streaks go cold. Cold streaks go hot.

01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:54.460
They know you went 80%
for half a season. They know.

01:33:55.140 --> 01:33:57.850
They're gonna remember
as soon as you win a game.

01:33:57.880 --> 01:34:00.100
Then we go into
March Madness baseball.

01:34:00.150 --> 01:34:02.540
Next year this won't even be a memory.

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.800
Who said anything about next year Walter?

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:09.430
You made a career choice buddy
and I bankrolled it.

01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:13.700
Mm-hm.

01:34:16.410 --> 01:34:17.830
OK?

01:34:17.870 --> 01:34:20.900
- Let him go.
- Let him go?

01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.280
Of course you stick up for him. Of course.

01:34:25.310 --> 01:34:27.530
Oh Walter.

01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:30.700
- Meaning what?
- I don't know. Meaning what?

01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:33.520
Meaning whose side are you on?

01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:39.250
I didn't realize I had to choose Walter.

01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:42.650
Brandon.

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:48.320
You're a champion. A champion
goes down 86 times he's up on the 87th.

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:51.510
I'm not gonna let you stay down. No way.

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:54.680
Because this is not about you. Or you.

01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.600
Or me. It's about your gift.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:01.620
Your gift transcends all this shit.

01:35:01.650 --> 01:35:04.800
Your gift is cosmic. It's metaphysic.

01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:07.930
It's eternal. It is God!

01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:11.990
Besides we have a contract.

01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:18.360
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit? Bullshit bullshit.

01:35:18.670 --> 01:35:22.070
- Walter you can't own someone.
- Who owns him?

01:35:22.110 --> 01:35:25.340
I created the greatest sports tout
this country's seen.

01:35:25.370 --> 01:35:27.800
I hooked him up with every major client.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.490
I built a fucking
television show around him.

01:35:31.530 --> 01:35:33.640
I took out full-page ads.

01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:36.810
I introduced him
to the major clients of the world.

01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:40.940
I did that.
I hooked you up with everybody.

01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.010
Think you're gonna walk out the door
take that with you

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:46.780
leave me here
holding the fucking sack? Bullshit!

01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:50.370
I don't know why I'm talking to you.
What has this got to do with you?

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.600
This is between me and him.
What are you doing in this office?

01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:55.690
What are you doing here? Get outta here!

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.610
Don't talk to her like that Walter.

01:35:59.650 --> 01:36:02.740
- It's between me and you.
- It is between you and me.

01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:07.680
Are you telling me how to talk to my wife?
You shut your fucking toilet.

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:11.640
Leave. Leave please Brandon. Go. Go.

01:36:11.670 --> 01:36:13.940
Please. Go. Leave.

01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:17.230
Listen to me you son of a bitch.

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:21.030
Don't you ever talk to me like that ever.

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.050
I'm sorry.

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:31.730
Hey Brandon! Hoo!

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:34.580
It's Walter. Don't get excited.

01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:37.190
All is forgiven.

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:39.070
Hey.

01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:43.820
- What time is it?
- It's 6am.

01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:47.890
I gotta fly to Vegas meet with
some clients - hand-holding thing -

01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:52.620
and just keep them aboard for the last game
because you can do this thing.

01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.130
End of the season's the perfect place
to turn a streak around.

01:36:56.170 --> 01:36:59.610
I'll be back tonight.
We'll go out. We'll have a good meal.

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:04.720
You know get you
back in the groove again. 9:30 Nobu.

01:37:04.750 --> 01:37:08.470
We're turning it around.
I'll see you tonight.

01:37:14.730 --> 01:37:16.920
Hey Brandon.

01:37:17.340 --> 01:37:19.110
Hey Toni.

01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.390
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Walter was delayed.

01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:27.560
He'll be back in the morning.
Asked if I'd fill in.

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.790
You know what's funny?

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:33.080
He didn't call me.

01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:38.660
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.220
Julia did her...

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:51.750
I'm sorry.

01:37:55.820 --> 01:37:58.110
He's gambling.

01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.870
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:06.140
I just can't believe I'm here again.

01:38:06.170 --> 01:38:08.180
I just...

01:38:08.230 --> 01:38:11.560
I just can't believe it you know.
I saw it coming.

01:38:11.590 --> 01:38:14.170
I just couldn't stop it.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.510
I gotta win one more game.

01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:25.750
You can't fix this Brandon.

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:29.190
You can't fix it.

01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:59.740
- Come here for a second.
- What?

01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:04.950
I'm gonna kiss you right now OK?
Trust me on this.

01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:36.240
OK Daddy open the present.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.040
Oh!

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.460
Oh look at this. It's so beautiful.

01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:49.480
Daddy not the paper! In there.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:52.560
Oh!

01:39:52.590 --> 01:39:54.680
Oh man.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:56.740
Beautiful.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.180
Baby this is beautiful.

01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:01.470
Happy anniversary.

01:40:01.890 --> 01:40:04.350
- I'll get it.
- OK.

01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:07.830
Oh thank you honey.
What am I gonna do with this?

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.480
- It's a dangerous thing to give me.
- Brandon!

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:13.630
- Hello.
- Look who's here.

01:40:13.670 --> 01:40:17.120
- Oh you're back from Vegas.
- Join the celebration.

01:40:17.150 --> 01:40:19.370
- What's going on?
- Well...

01:40:19.410 --> 01:40:23.060
Toni and I were married
12 years ago today.

01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:25.830
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:28.590
Angel give Mommy her gift.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:38.910
It's OK baby. I saved for it.

01:40:38.940 --> 01:40:41.620
We got enough believe me.

01:40:43.290 --> 01:40:45.900
We're not broke yet honey. Put 'em on.

01:40:46.210 --> 01:40:50.170
Come on. I wanna see them on you.
Let me see them.

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.630
Ooh!

01:40:52.670 --> 01:40:56.220
I got beautiful taste don't I?
Brandon I couldn't leave you out.

01:40:56.250 --> 01:41:00.080
It's sort of our anniversary
anyway isn't it?

01:41:01.230 --> 01:41:03.370
They're made for car racing.

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:08.320
The guy who wore this
won six straight times at Le Mans.

01:41:08.350 --> 01:41:10.820
Put it on.
Maybe you'll start winning again.

01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:13.110
Walter I can't take this man.

01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:17.140
- Why not?
- It's too much.

01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.830
We all love each other here right?
You're family.

01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.960
I'm like your father you're like my son.

01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.130
That would make you his mother
wouldn't it Toni?

01:41:29.690 --> 01:41:32.820
Oh I said something wrong didn't I?

01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:35.950
What are you doing? Keep 'em on.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:41.480
- They're for evening Walter.
- So what? Wear 'em to bed. Come on.

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:43.630
Brandon I got you.

01:41:43.670 --> 01:41:45.500
Who do you like in the big game?

01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.090
- Turn that off Walter.
- Why? What are you camera shy?

01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:51.810
- Turn that off.
- Hey man surprise me.

01:41:51.850 --> 01:41:54.510
We'll break it
when we do the live TV show.

01:42:11.930 --> 01:42:16.930
Coming up on "Sports Advisors,"
John Anthony's Super Forty selections.

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:20.060
It's live, and it's next.

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.230
I know he's supposed to be here.
I know where he is. He's in the bathroom.

01:42:29.650 --> 01:42:31.390
Fuck!

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:35.700
Two minutes till we go live.

01:42:38.210 --> 01:42:40.390
What the hell is he doing?

01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:57.080
Heads New York tails Kansas City.

01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:01.670
Heads over tails under.

01:43:03.130 --> 01:43:05.110
John Anthony!

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:15.330
- Here he is.
- 40 seconds till we're live.

01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:18.040
40 seconds.
Come on come on come on.

01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.590
- We're at 30.
- Uh New York minus one and a half

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:28.780
and the over 36.

01:43:29.510 --> 01:43:31.760
Wanna know about those picks?

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:34.460
- 20 seconds to air.
- Hold on.

01:43:34.500 --> 01:43:37.060
What should I know about 'em?

01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.630
I flipped a coin to decide.

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:45.570
- Ten.
- Push it all the way Southie.

01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:49.900
And five four

01:43:49.930 --> 01:43:52.310
three two...

01:43:52.350 --> 01:43:56.830
Live from the WDIX studios
high above Manhattan,

01:43:56.860 --> 01:43:59.020
here's your host, Walter Abrams.

01:43:59.130 --> 01:44:02.570
Hello everybody
and welcome to the big weekend.

01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:07.780
Never before in the history of this industry
has an offer been made

01:44:07.810 --> 01:44:10.240
like the one I'm about to present
to you now.

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:15.180
I am so confident
in John Anthony's picks for this Sunday

01:44:15.220 --> 01:44:19.000
I'm so sure of the skills
he's brought to bear

01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.280
and so anxious for you
to get on the phone

01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:25.470
and dial the toll-free number
on your screen

01:44:25.510 --> 01:44:29.470
that for the first time
in sports-service history

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:33.430
I am going to guarantee our picks
this weekend.

01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:38.750
- What's that mean?
- What does that mean? It means this.

01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:43.030
You tell us how much you're betting
with your bookie

01:44:43.060 --> 01:44:46.050
you lose we cover.

01:44:46.990 --> 01:44:50.330
You heard me right. That's risk-free.

01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.740
Now let's go to the oracle

01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:55.820
God's gift John Anthony.

01:44:55.860 --> 01:44:58.630
Wow. That's all I can say.

01:44:58.670 --> 01:45:03.220
The phones are gonna be flooded Walter
and they should be.

01:45:03.260 --> 01:45:08.320
Hey John why don't you run down
the pitfalls facing the average bettor?

01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:13.370
I mean when you think about it a game
this huge all the added dynamics...

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.940
I mean uh without your expertise

01:45:15.980 --> 01:45:21.090
I guess the average bettor might as well
just what flip a coin.

01:45:21.120 --> 01:45:25.010
Walter? No no no no
no no no no no no no.

01:45:25.050 --> 01:45:30.470
Hang on. You can't guarantee that they're gonna win.
That's insane. Come on.

01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:35.480
I say if you can flip a coin to make a pick
I can guarantee the game.

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:38.980
- What if we lose?
- Ah fuck it. I'm ruined anyway.

01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:43.720
Look man. Cover your ass all right.
At least cap the thing out right?

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:47.120
- Oh Brandon can't you feel it?
- What?

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:51.020
- Can't you just feel it?
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:45:51.050 --> 01:45:54.310
Oh I think you do. I think you do.

01:45:54.350 --> 01:45:58.000
You know the best part of the best drug
in the world ain't the high.

01:45:58.040 --> 01:46:01.130
It's the moment just before you take it.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:03.320
The dice are dancing on the table.

01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:07.080
Between now and the time they stop

01:46:08.010 --> 01:46:10.620
that's the greatest high in the world.

01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:15.160
Made up your mind yet?
It's the last minute! I'm here to make you money!

01:46:15.190 --> 01:46:19.070
New York's the one-and-a-half point
favorite the over and under is 36.

01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:21.110
I want you to bet New York in the over.

01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:24.340
- Come on guy it's a fucking lock.
- It's New York in the over.

01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:28.450
You can parlay it tease it
do whatever you want 'cause it's guaranteed.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:30.750
- Our reputation is the guarantee.
- Tammy!

01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:31.850
I'm coming.

01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:34.980
28 years in the business
we're not going anywhere.

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:40.030
- Can we please get some air in here?
- You gotta make up your mind.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.950
OK that's it. Kill the phones. Come on.

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:45.200
Right now. Let's go let's go.

01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:48.270
They come from New York
and Kansas City in this match-up.

01:46:48.300 --> 01:46:50.770
The opening kickoff is coming up next.

01:46:57.860 --> 01:47:02.190
We are under way in Super Forty. It's
a high end-over-ender. Down the middle.

01:47:02.450 --> 01:47:06.520
Jackson gets it, a short one for the 15,
tries to angle over to the right side,

01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:09.020
stripped away from...

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.000
- Kansas City comes up with it.
- Ah man.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:17.150
Harris getting to the outside, turns,
clear path. Boy, does he have blocking.

01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:19.400
- Touchdown, Kansas City.
- Shit.

01:47:19.450 --> 01:47:22.850
- Sets out for the pocket. Simpson.
- He's open.

01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:27.060
Guns one over the middle, Simpson
on the completion. It's second and 15.

01:47:27.090 --> 01:47:29.470
- Setting up, he's got time again.
- Go go.

01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:31.810
Looks down field
and the slam intercepted.

01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:34.630
- What the fuck is that?
- Dawkins finds a wave of blockers.

01:47:34.670 --> 01:47:40.300
Over to the near side, he's going to go
the distance. Touchdown, Kansas City.

01:47:40.330 --> 01:47:43.220
14-nothing, Kansas City over New York.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.980
New York's got it now
for the third time in the game.

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:51.360
Back to throw once again,
pocket collapses and down it goes.

01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:55.170
Oh man. You better hold on
to that coin you flipped

01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:59.490
because this game keeps up like this
I'm gonna have to borrow it.

01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.000
Well it's not over yet Walter.

01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:04.490
I wouldn't change my bet. Hm?

01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:10.750
And second and long,
second and about a dozen.

01:48:10.780 --> 01:48:13.460
Can they get something started?

01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:19.410
What are they counting on today?
Do they have to get away

01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.970
from the balanced attack
we've seen all season?

01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:26.770
Will they lose the ground game now?
Will they go over to the pass?

01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:32.230
Well, there is no way they'll be able
to run when they're 14 points down.

01:48:44.540 --> 01:48:49.230
Handoff goes to the second man through.
It's Jones, fullback, off the right side.

01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:52.250
He's got room, downfield he goes.
Will anybody catch him?

01:48:52.290 --> 01:48:55.490
Deep into the secondary now.
Touchdown, New York.

01:48:56.430 --> 01:49:00.390
Extra point makes it 14-7, Kansas City.

01:49:01.540 --> 01:49:07.020
Kansas scores on the eight-play
drive, capped with Rogers's 32-yard run.

01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:13.420
And that's the end of the third quarter.
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, ten.

01:49:13.450 --> 01:49:16.410
Back to throw once again.
Post available...

01:49:16.450 --> 01:49:19.580
- Let's go!
... beats the safety down the right side.

01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:21.570
He's in!

01:49:21.610 --> 01:49:23.390
All right!

01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:29.380
It's Kansas City, 21, New York, 17. What
a final four minutes we're going to have.

01:49:29.410 --> 01:49:30.940
- Where's Brandon?
- I don't know.

01:49:30.970 --> 01:49:33.030
Where's Brandon?

01:49:34.170 --> 01:49:36.740
We're back in it babe!

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:40.010
New York touchdown
and we win both bets!

01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:42.680
Hey!

01:49:42.730 --> 01:49:46.020
- Hey Brandon?
- I believe this'll be their final possession.

01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:49.980
Can they do it? Can they get it done
like they have all year long?

01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:55.130
They're trailing by four. Don't forget,
the new rule doesn't apply here.

01:49:55.170 --> 01:49:57.640
They've gotta get into the end zone.

01:49:58.370 --> 01:50:01.030
- He left.
- I know.

01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:03.690
You didn't tell me?

01:50:07.650 --> 01:50:09.590
How about that?

01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:12.820
No goodbye no... no nothing.

01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:17.350
- I'm sure it's all there in the letter.
- I'm sure it is.

01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:20.580
I wonder what's not in here.

01:50:20.610 --> 01:50:23.190
What do you mean?

01:50:23.710 --> 01:50:29.130
- What do you mean what do I mean?
- He had enough. He wanted his life back.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:31.070
He said that to you?

01:50:31.110 --> 01:50:34.140
Well loud and clear by leaving.

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:39.560
- I think it was something else.
- Yeah? Tell me.

01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.370
You know.

01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:44.310
No.

01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:47.170
You have no idea?

01:50:49.050 --> 01:50:53.220
- You're missing the game Walter.
- Oh no. This is the game.

01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:55.470
On first down,
the handoff is to Jones.

01:50:55.510 --> 01:50:58.640
He's on the right side.
He's got a blocker. And a first down.

01:50:58.670 --> 01:51:00.890
- But he's dropped inbounds.
- Nice.

01:51:00.940 --> 01:51:03.910
I guess Brandon was homesick.
I don't know.

01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:06.880
Or maybe he had
such deep feelings for me

01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:11.150
that he couldn't face saying goodbye.

01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:17.620
Wait a minute.

01:51:19.500 --> 01:51:22.520
I just got an idea. Just came to me.

01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:25.230
I mean out of the blue.

01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:27.210
What about this?

01:51:28.050 --> 01:51:33.050
Brandon didn't tell me
he was gonna leave because...

01:51:33.890 --> 01:51:36.600
you let him fuck you.

01:51:38.580 --> 01:51:42.650
Back to pass, rolls under the left side.
Guns it over the middle, it's complete.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:45.360
Edwards has it, all the way
down to the 44, Kansas City.

01:51:45.390 --> 01:51:47.550
Oh God.

01:51:48.170 --> 01:51:50.780
- You deny it?
- Oh my God.

01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:54.120
Do I have to Walter?

01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.470
You know you did.

01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:58.910
Oh you...
Another lock of the year?

01:51:58.950 --> 01:52:00.850
I saw you Toni.

01:52:00.900 --> 01:52:04.020
I saw you and him that night.

01:52:04.060 --> 01:52:06.380
I never went to Vegas.

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.030
You mean you lied to me about the trip.

01:52:09.060 --> 01:52:11.180
Oh don't talk to me about lying.

01:52:11.220 --> 01:52:15.490
- I guess you had the whole thing set up.
- Oh don't make this about me.

01:52:15.530 --> 01:52:19.620
- Just put me out there on a tray?
- I put a tray out there.

01:52:19.670 --> 01:52:24.840
You didn't have to shove a fucking apple
in your mouth and sit on it!

01:52:24.880 --> 01:52:28.840
He's looking for his hot receiver.
Edwards, again, got it! Kansas City, 23.

01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:30.510
Admit it!

01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.220
You played me Walter.

01:52:33.330 --> 01:52:36.450
You're fucking-A I did.

01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:40.380
It worked. Didn't it?

01:52:40.420 --> 01:52:44.170
With eight seconds left, New York
has to spend their final time-out.

01:52:44.200 --> 01:52:46.320
Brandon was right.

01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:50.220
- But you don't deny it?
- It's the best pick he ever made.

01:52:50.850 --> 01:52:53.200
I don't know what that means.

01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:58.350
Deep drop sets up in the pocket. Fires
over the middle. Batted down at the line!

01:52:58.380 --> 01:53:02.520
So after everything,
it all comes down to one final play.

01:53:04.610 --> 01:53:08.780
You were gambling with me that night Walter.
With me!

01:53:09.930 --> 01:53:12.290
Brandon knew it
because he knew you.

01:53:12.330 --> 01:53:14.790
He told me he was sure
you were watching somehow.

01:53:14.830 --> 01:53:19.000
So he asked me in to spend the night
and put on a little show for you Walter.

01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:23.030
But I didn't believe him Walter.
Oh God I didn't believe him.

01:53:23.070 --> 01:53:27.030
I mean after all we've been through.
So I figured you know "What the hell?"

01:53:27.060 --> 01:53:29.640
He slipped out the back no big deal.

01:53:29.670 --> 01:53:32.040
He never even stayed here.

01:53:32.450 --> 01:53:34.020
And you.

01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:36.900
You were in such a good mood
the next day.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:40.070
I figured "Thank God
because he must've been wrong. "

01:53:40.100 --> 01:53:43.190
"Otherwise why wouldn't he confront us
confront me?"

01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:44.610
Oh Walter.

01:53:44.650 --> 01:53:49.760
So it all boils down to this.
Can New York find the end zone?

01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:52.220
This is what players dream of.

01:53:52.270 --> 01:53:55.870
The chance to win it on the final snap.

01:53:55.920 --> 01:54:00.710
You wanted to lose! Like I was something
you could just toss on the table!

01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.170
Only we booked your bet Walter
Brandon and me

01:54:03.220 --> 01:54:07.180
who evidently love you
more than you love yourself.

01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:10.990
Spreads the defense.
Drops back to throw.

01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.750
Here comes the pressure.
He bounces to the right side.

01:54:13.780 --> 01:54:17.190
Your fantasy is to end up alone
with nothing!

01:54:19.070 --> 01:54:21.110
I won't let that happen.
Understand?

01:54:21.150 --> 01:54:24.280
I will never let that happen to you.
This is it.

01:54:24.310 --> 01:54:27.260
He's on the run,
picks up a big block downfield.

01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:32.520
This is real Walter.
You and me and Julia we're all that's real.

01:54:34.290 --> 01:54:35.650
One man to beat.

01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:38.730
This is it Walter.

01:54:38.770 --> 01:54:40.920
He goes airborne from the five.

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.360
- Does he get in?
- He's in! He's in!

01:54:44.930 --> 01:54:47.850
Touchdown, New York!

01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:57.300
Apaches win this game a-whoosh!

01:55:58.030 --> 01:56:01.260
Giants with me! Over here with me!
This side this side

01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:03.760
this side right in front of me right here.

01:56:03.790 --> 01:56:05.910
Take a knee take a knee take a knee.

01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:10.330
We got a tough team we're playing today
y'all know that. Toughest on our schedule.

01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:15.090
Now most important thing
we're gonna do today is have fun.

01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:19.930
I mean have some serious fun.
We're gonna play loose and enjoy ourselves.

01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:22.430
We're gonna play
this wonderful game of football.

01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:24.470
- Do we wanna win?
- Yeah!

01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:27.220
- What are we gonna do play?
- Play!

01:56:27.260 --> 01:56:28.540
- Huh?
- Play!

01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:32.440
Ah let's go do it!

01:56:38.590 --> 01:56:40.640
What's going on chief?

01:56:40.680 --> 01:56:43.810
Coach do you really think
we can win today?

01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.950
Ho!

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.350
I'd bet on it.
