02:15.135 --> 02:19.972
It is believed that
the indictment is only one of a series

02:20.056 --> 02:24.893
to be handed down as the result of
a special grand jury investigation.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.105
Graverobbing in Texas
is this hour's top news story.

02:28.189 --> 02:32.401
An informant led officers of the Muerto
County Sheriff's Department to a cemetery

02:32.485 --> 02:36.655
just outside the small rural Texas
community of Newt early this morning.

02:36.739 --> 02:40.325
Officers there discovered
what appeared to be a grisly work of art,

02:40.410 --> 02:44.997
the remains of a badly decomposed body
wired to a large monument.

02:45.081 --> 02:49.084
A second body was found in a ditch
near the perimeter of the cemetery.

02:49.169 --> 02:53.213
Subsequent investigation has revealed
at least a dozen empty crypts,

02:53.298 --> 02:56.508
and it's feared more will turn up
as the probe continues.

02:56.593 --> 03:01.305
Deputies report that in some instances,
only parts of a corpse had been removed,

03:01.389 --> 03:04.141
the head or in some cases
the extremities removed,

03:04.225 --> 03:06.685
the remainder of the corpse left intact.

03:06.769 --> 03:10.564
Evidence indicates the robberies
have occurred over a period of time.

03:10.648 --> 03:14.818
Sheriff Jesus Maldonado refused
to give details of the ghoulish case

03:14.903 --> 03:17.279
and said only that
he did have strong evidence

03:17.363 --> 03:20.407
linking the crime to elements
outside the state.

03:20.491 --> 03:23.785
Area residents have reportedly converged
on the cemetery,

03:23.870 --> 03:26.788
fearing the remains of relatives
have been removed.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.959
No suspects are in custody, as
the investigation at the scene continues.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.880
Oil storage units
continue to burn out of control

03:34.964 --> 03:38.967
at the huge Texaco refinery
near the Texas-Louisiana border.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.720
Three storage units exploded
into flames during the night,

03:41.804 --> 03:45.265
killing at least three workers
and injuring a dozen more.

03:45.350 --> 03:49.478
Fire-fighting units in three Texas cities
continue to battle the holocaust,

03:49.562 --> 03:52.147
in an effort to confine 40-foot flames.

03:52.232 --> 03:57.027
Smoke from the fire is visible to Houston
residents some 60 miles to the south.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.780
Health officials in San Francisco
reluctantly admit

03:59.864 --> 04:02.449
they may have a cholera epidemic
on their hands.

04:02.533 --> 04:07.037
Some 40 cases of the highly infectious
disease have been confirmed.

04:10.667 --> 04:14.086
...is responsible for spread of the disease.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.922
Houston police are puzzled over
an outbreak of violence

04:17.005 --> 04:19.466
apparently touched off by a suicide.

04:19.550 --> 04:24.096
A young man, reportedly angered by a
local television blackout of a sports event,

04:24.180 --> 04:26.932
jumped from the tenth-story window
of his apartment.

04:27.016 --> 04:31.103
A second man allegedly threatened to
leap to his death from the same window,

04:31.187 --> 04:33.272
but was restrained by police.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.608
Witnesses to the incident
reportedly heard the man jump...

04:47.120 --> 04:49.621
She offered no explanation for the attack.

04:49.706 --> 04:54.751
The lieutenant was treated for minor
wounds at the hospital and released.

04:54.836 --> 04:59.589
A 16-story building under construction
in downtown Atlanta collapsed today,

04:59.674 --> 05:02.050
killing at least 29 persons.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.138
The engineering firm responsible for
the structural design of the building

05:06.222 --> 05:09.016
could offer no explanation for the collapse.

05:09.100 --> 05:13.312
The construction firm says
there's no logical reason for the collapse

05:13.396 --> 05:15.981
and suspects sabotage.

05:16.065 --> 05:19.026
Police in Gary, Indiana,
have been unable to identify

05:19.110 --> 05:21.236
the bodies of a young man and woman...

05:26.617 --> 05:29.244
...stab wounds
and their features carved away.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.455
The man's genitals had been removed,

05:31.539 --> 05:35.000
and police first identified the victims
as two women.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.269
OK?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.255
Franklin!

06:26.135 --> 06:28.678
Ah!

06:32.934 --> 06:36.311
- Are you OK?
- I was... Shit.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.232
OK.

06:40.316 --> 06:44.069
This heat is just driving me crazy.
I don't know if I can take much more.

06:44.153 --> 06:47.864
Listen, the condition of retrogradation
is contrary or inharmonious to

06:47.949 --> 06:51.326
the regular direction
of actual movement in the zodiac

06:51.411 --> 06:54.162
and is, in that respect, evil.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.040
Hence, when malefic planets
are in retrograde -

06:57.125 --> 07:01.336
and Saturn's malefic, OK? -
their maleficence is increased.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.089
Have you been doing
those word power columns?

07:04.173 --> 07:06.550
It just means that Saturn's a bad influence.

07:06.634 --> 07:11.012
It's just particularly a bad influence now
because it's in retrograde.

07:11.097 --> 07:14.182
- You believe that stuff she's hawking me?
- I don't know.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.496
My granddaddy's buried here.
Did anything happen to him?

07:36.581 --> 07:39.249
- What's your granddaddy's name?
- That big feller

07:39.333 --> 07:42.919
at the stand with that flashlight in his hand,
that's the sheriff.

07:43.004 --> 07:46.131
You tell him your granddaddy's
buried in there.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.841
- He'll let you in.
- Thank you.

07:47.925 --> 07:52.095
I'm gonna run off with your girl a minute.
Honey, I'll get you the sheriff.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.265
Let us through.
This girl's granddaddy's buried here.

07:55.349 --> 07:58.101
Been in there the whole time,
unbeknownst to Clyde.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.104
Clyde didn't know, either.
They didn't know why...

08:01.189 --> 08:05.025
Things happen hereabout
they don't tell about.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.030
I see things.

08:11.991 --> 08:18.246
You see, they say
it's just an old man talking.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.583
You laugh at an old man.

08:22.543 --> 08:26.588
There's them that laughs and knows better.

08:33.846 --> 08:38.058
They're sure. The man said they
could tell if the grave had been dug up.

08:38.142 --> 08:42.729
Franklin, don't worry. I saw it myself.
It didn't look dug up to me.

08:46.776 --> 08:50.070
- Oh, what's that?
- What smells?

08:52.281 --> 08:54.282
What is that stench?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.743
Roll up the window.

08:58.579 --> 09:02.541
Hey, that's the old slaughterhouse.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.419
That's where Grandpa used to
sell his cattle.

09:06.504 --> 09:10.340
We got an uncle that works at one of
those places outside of Ft. Worth.

09:10.424 --> 09:15.887
That's where they kill them. They bash
them in the head with a sledgehammer.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.975
- That's awful.
- It usually wouldn't kill 'em on the first lick.

09:35.908 --> 09:40.453
They'd start squealing and freaking out,
and they'd have to bash 'em three times.

09:40.538 --> 09:44.165
They'd skin them sometimes
before they were even dead.

09:44.250 --> 09:48.211
That's horrible.
People shouldn't kill animals for food.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.255
They don't do it like that anymore.

09:50.339 --> 09:54.593
Now they got this big gun that shoots
a bolt into their skull, then retracts it.

09:54.677 --> 09:57.178
It's just boom! It goes boom!
And boom!

09:57.263 --> 10:00.223
Franklin, I like meat.
Please change the subject.

10:00.308 --> 10:03.935
- Boom!
- That's terrible. It's still going on.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.356
Oh, man, it's hot in here.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.115
- Hitchhiker.
- Should we pick him up?

10:17.199 --> 10:20.535
- Yeah. He'll asphyxiate out there.
- What does he look like?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.288
Son of a bitch is gonna
smell like a slaughterhouse.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.249
Oh, give the guy a break.
He can sit by Franklin.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.293
- What do you want to do?
- He's weird-looking.

10:28.377 --> 10:30.003
- Pick him up, man.
- No!

10:48.898 --> 10:51.775
Well, I think we just picked up Dracula.

10:51.859 --> 10:54.653
- Where you headed, man?
- South.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.780
You work at that place?

10:56.864 --> 10:58.657
Oh, no.

10:58.741 --> 11:02.911
- How did you get stuck way out here?
- I was at the slaughterhouse.

11:02.995 --> 11:06.831
- My uncle works for the slaughterhouse.
- My brother worked there.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.125
My-my grandfather too.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.004
My family's always been in meat.

11:13.130 --> 11:15.674
A whole family of Draculas.

11:16.425 --> 11:19.219
Hey, man, did you go
in that slaughter room?

11:19.303 --> 11:21.971
Where they shoot the cattle
with that big air gun?

11:22.056 --> 11:26.559
- Oh, that-that-that gun's no good.
- I was in there once with my uncle.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.354
The old way with a sledge.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.108
See, that was better.
They died better that way.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.235
How come? I thought the gun was better.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.529
Oh, no, no.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.116
With the new way,
the people are put out of jobs.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.201
You do that?

11:43.285 --> 11:44.619
Look.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.544
- I was the killer.
- Damn.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.880
- Let me see them.
- They don't send the heads away.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.049
- You took these, huh?
- Yeah.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.801
Franklin.

12:01.345 --> 12:04.848
See, they make head cheese.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.808
They...

12:08.269 --> 12:10.228
they take the head,

12:10.312 --> 12:13.064
and they boil it,
except for the tongue,

12:13.149 --> 12:16.818
and they scrape all the flesh
away from the bone.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.821
They use everything.
They don't throw nothing way.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.906
They use the jowls

12:21.991 --> 12:25.869
and the muscles and the eyes
and ligaments and everything.

12:25.953 --> 12:27.746
- Oh.
- Look at this.

12:27.830 --> 12:32.917
The nose and the gums and all the flesh,
and they boil it down into a big jelly of fat.

12:33.002 --> 12:35.628
Wow. I didn't know
that's what was in that stuff.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.047
It's really good. You like it?

12:38.674 --> 12:41.426
Oh, yeah, sure, I like it.
It's good.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.971
It sounds horrible.
Could we talk about something else?

12:45.055 --> 12:47.599
You'd like it
if you didn't know what was in it.

12:47.683 --> 12:50.435
I wouldn't,
and I wish you'd stop talking about it.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.770
Oh.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.189
Come on, you're making everybody sick.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.274
Oh, all right.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.000
What are you doing?

13:15.628 --> 13:18.463
Hey, man, put that knife up.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.221
Oh!

13:26.305 --> 13:28.348
Oh, come on.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.351
Oh! What are you doing to yourself?

13:32.353 --> 13:35.438
Oh, my God!
Why are you doing that?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.574
Put that away.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.265
I have this knife.

14:10.933 --> 14:13.101
Put that away, too.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.856
- It's a good knife.
- I'm sure it is, man.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.941
Fold it up.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.735
Hey, you took my picture.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.654
Hey, you-you could take me to my house.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.240
I live right off this road.

15:09.325 --> 15:13.411
Well, I don't know, man.
We're in pretty much of a hurry.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.581
- How close is it?
- It's real close.

15:16.665 --> 15:21.336
Well, couldn't you just walk?
I mean, if it's so close.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.422
Yeah, you could have dinner with us.

15:24.506 --> 15:28.426
You like head cheese?
My brother makes it real good. You'll like it.

15:28.510 --> 15:32.388
I think you better push on now.
Don't you, Jerry?

15:33.015 --> 15:34.682
Yeah, I'm sorry.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.165
It didn't turn out so good.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.628
- It's a nice picture. You can pay me now.
- Huh?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.631
Two dollars. It's a good picture.

16:06.715 --> 16:10.259
No, man.
Franklin, give him back the damn picture.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.804
- He tried to sell him that picture.
- You're kidding?

16:12.888 --> 16:14.931
No, I'm serious.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.429
What are you doing?

16:58.934 --> 17:01.394
Hey, Jerry, pull us over!

17:01.478 --> 17:05.147
Hey, man, what's up?
What are you doing?

17:12.321 --> 17:14.323
Get out.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.560
Oh, my God.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.605
Oh, I'm about half ready to call a cop.

17:45.689 --> 17:49.525
That's the last goddamn hitchhiker
I ever pick up.

17:55.657 --> 17:59.660
Hey, listen to Franklin's horoscope.

17:59.745 --> 18:00.995
Oh, Sally.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.499
"Travel in the country,
long-range plans

18:04.583 --> 18:06.876
"and upsetting persons around you

18:06.960 --> 18:11.339
"could make this a disturbing
and unpredictable day.

18:11.423 --> 18:15.635
The events in the world are not
doing much either to cheer one up."

18:15.719 --> 18:19.347
- That's just perfect.
- Franklin, I think that will be all right.

18:19.431 --> 18:22.850
And now read Sally's.
She's a Capricorn.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.401
Oh, no.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.862
Capricorn's ruled by Saturn.

18:36.240 --> 18:40.409
"There are moments when we cannot
believe that what is happening is true.

18:40.494 --> 18:43.621
Pinch yourself
and you may find out that it is."

19:10.190 --> 19:12.191
Everybody out.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.697
Hurry up, so we can get home.

19:25.747 --> 19:27.999
Here comes somebody.

19:33.630 --> 19:35.590
How are you?

19:37.342 --> 19:40.094
Would you fill her up, please?

19:40.596 --> 19:43.014
I got no gas.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.267
- You're out of gas?
- My tank's empty.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.520
The transport won't be here
until late this afternoon,

19:49.605 --> 19:53.441
maybe not even until tomorrow morning.

19:53.525 --> 19:57.195
Hey, do you know where
the old Franklin place is?

20:01.325 --> 20:03.659
- The old Franklin place?
- Yeah.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.412
It's an old two-story rock house on a hill.

20:06.496 --> 20:10.958
I think you have to turn on that road
back there, but I'm not real sure.

20:11.043 --> 20:15.296
Yeah, maybe I seen something like that
up that way.

20:16.381 --> 20:21.385
Well, now look, you boys don't want
to go messing around no old house.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.430
Those things is dangerous.
You're liable to get hurt.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.098
We'll be careful.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.852
You don't want to go fooling around
with other folks' property.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.980
Some folks don't like it,
and they don't mind showing you.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.567
- Oh, my father owns it.
- That's your daddy's place, huh?

20:36.652 --> 20:37.610
Yeah.

20:37.694 --> 20:40.905
Look, I got some good barbeque here.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.699
Why don't you fellas
stick around here a while?

20:43.784 --> 20:47.119
That transport will be by in a little while.

20:48.664 --> 20:51.916
Well, you want to get
some barbeque?

20:52.000 --> 20:57.088
Them girls, now, they don't want to
go messing around an old house.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.715
It's best you stick around here.

21:10.894 --> 21:13.896
We should've asked
if there's another gas station around.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.941
Don't you think he would've told us
if there was?

21:17.025 --> 21:20.236
Man, it wouldn't hurt to ask, you know?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.363
OK, I'll go ask.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.245
I knew the hell we should've
stopped back there for gas.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.831
- Press it.
- I'm pulling it down.

21:31.915 --> 21:34.917
- There.
- You think this place has room service?

21:36.461 --> 21:40.631
Franklin, you maniac,
you're tearing up the van.

21:40.716 --> 21:44.635
Um, yeah, I just started doing that.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.892
Hey, I bet that's some of that guy's blood.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.979
Look at that. Look at that.

21:55.063 --> 21:58.399
- You think that's blood?
- Yeah, I guess so.

22:00.402 --> 22:05.948
Oh, that's blood, all right.
And that guy cut the hell out of himself.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.160
You think you could do that to yourself?

22:09.244 --> 22:12.997
- I'm not crazy.
- Yeah, yeah.

22:13.081 --> 22:19.086
It takes something, though, I mean just
to do that to yourself like he did. God!

22:21.214 --> 22:24.342
Hey, you think I said something
made him mad?

22:26.428 --> 22:30.556
- Well, what?
- Franklin, you're crazier than he was.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.810
Hey, I got us some barbeque.

22:34.895 --> 22:38.773
- Newt's the closest place to get gas.
- Aw.

22:43.695 --> 22:47.907
Aren't we going out to Grandpa's place?
There's a creek. You could go swimming.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.283
Let's go.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.535
Come on, Sally.
We're going to Grandpa's place.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.912
Let's go!

22:52.996 --> 22:57.124
Hey, that guy smeared blood
all over the van.

22:58.001 --> 23:01.796
- Like he was trying to write something.
- What'd he do?

23:01.880 --> 23:04.548
Did he write something on the van?

23:25.404 --> 23:27.446
Let me see your knife.

23:31.451 --> 23:32.451
Thank you.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.420
Franklin, if we run out of gas
before we get back to that station,

23:42.504 --> 23:45.423
you're towing us back in your chair.

23:54.683 --> 23:58.352
Hey, you think that guy's
just trying to scare us

23:58.437 --> 24:01.814
by, you know,
blowing up my picture like that?

24:47.736 --> 24:51.363
Oh, I wish they hadn't
let the place fall apart.

24:52.365 --> 24:55.451
It looks like the birth place
of Bela Lugosi.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.578
- I'm scared.
- I'll help you with that.

24:57.662 --> 25:00.789
- See that window over there?
- That's strange.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.339
Hey, watch my arms.
Watch out.

25:08.423 --> 25:12.176
- Be straight. Come on. Hey.
- I'll get you from here.

25:12.260 --> 25:16.388
I want to see that smear
that guy made.

25:21.394 --> 25:25.940
- Oh, man.
- Weird. I wonder if that means something.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.025
It's the mark of Zorro.
He's going to get you.

25:28.109 --> 25:30.027
- Come on.
- Why don't you wash it off?

25:30.111 --> 25:32.530
I want to show you the inside.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.324
- Jerry!
- OK.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.662
Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute.

25:39.746 --> 25:43.415
- Come on, Kirk.
- Here, man, you wash it off.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.210
You don't think that guy would try
and follow us?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.546
What for?

25:59.933 --> 26:01.892
Where's my knife? Kirk?

26:04.980 --> 26:07.273
It looks like it must've been a nursery.

26:07.357 --> 26:11.068
This is my room. I got to stay here one time
when I was eight years old.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.029
- Right after my grandmother died.
- What happened?

26:14.114 --> 26:17.366
- What happened to my grandmother?
- Yeah. She died.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.695
- What do you think of the wallpaper?
- It's seen better days.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.573
These animals used to talk me to sleep
when I was little.

26:57.657 --> 27:00.993
Look at the zebras.
I had these fascination for the zebras.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.538
Sally!

27:31.232 --> 27:33.067
Sally!

28:40.969 --> 28:44.513
Come on, Franklin.
It's gonna be a fun trip.

28:53.106 --> 28:57.818
If I have any more fun today,
I don't think I'm going to be able to take it.

29:01.865 --> 29:03.532
Aah! Ah!

29:16.671 --> 29:19.840
- Hey, Franklin.
- Hey, Franklin. What's wrong?

29:20.842 --> 29:23.135
You said there was a swimming hole
around here?

29:23.219 --> 29:24.720
Yeah.

29:25.680 --> 29:29.183
Well, Pam and I would like to go swimming,
man.

29:30.685 --> 29:35.814
Uh, there used to be a trail
down between those two old sheds.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.900
Come on, we'll find it.

29:40.028 --> 29:45.282
- Are Jerry and Sally going?
- (Kirk) No. We'll see you in an hour or so.

29:46.576 --> 29:50.704
Yeah.
We'll see you in about an hour or so.

30:10.225 --> 30:15.229
Sally?

30:19.734 --> 30:21.443
Sally!

30:32.163 --> 30:34.289
Zero in the world.

30:35.291 --> 30:38.252
Just shoot him
and put us out of our misery.

30:40.088 --> 30:42.339
- Snakes and spiders!
- Stop it!

30:42.423 --> 30:45.717
And scorpions! Man-eating lizards.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.475
- Kirk, help. Kirk!
- Ow. Ow.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.060
Oh.

30:56.062 --> 30:57.771
Crap.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.569
This must be it.

31:03.653 --> 31:06.196
Oh, are you OK?

31:06.281 --> 31:09.533
How the hell did Franklin
ever get down here, anyway?

31:09.617 --> 31:13.370
Somebody must've carried him
when he was little.

31:13.454 --> 31:15.789
Franklin never was little.

31:25.008 --> 31:27.092
Gasoline.

31:27.635 --> 31:32.514
I can leave him my guitar, give him a
couple bucks. We're coming back anyway.

31:32.599 --> 31:36.143
I can pick up my guitar, give him a couple
more dollars and bring him some gas.

31:36.227 --> 31:39.313
They don't want your guitar.
They won't want to sell us gas.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.773
Let's just go back now.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.859
Hey, come here.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.986
Come here and look at this.

32:52.929 --> 32:55.555
- A generator.
- What?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.600
A generator! For electricity.

33:01.396 --> 33:04.523
Hey, hello in there! Is anybody here?

33:49.068 --> 33:51.111
Hello, is anybody home?

34:12.800 --> 34:14.885
I got something for you.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.014
Ah!

34:20.099 --> 34:21.099
Ooh!

34:21.976 --> 34:23.976
Let's go!

34:27.774 --> 34:40.869
Hello?

34:41.996 --> 34:44.456
- Hey, Pam, come look at this.
- What? No!

34:48.710 --> 34:50.337
Hello?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.759
Is anybody home?

34:57.261 --> 34:58.261
Hello?

35:09.649 --> 35:11.650
Hey, Pam.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.158
Hello?

35:43.391 --> 35:45.016
Kirk?

35:58.781 --> 36:00.282
Kirk!

36:09.000 --> 36:20.927
Kirk?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.411
Kirk.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.291
Kirk?

36:59.926 --> 37:01.593
Kirk?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.996
Oh! Oh, God!

39:02.256 --> 39:04.549
Kirk! Kirk!

40:27.425 --> 40:29.717
He's gonna get you, Franklin.

40:29.802 --> 40:34.597
- You don't think it means anything?
- We'll protect you.

40:34.682 --> 40:38.560
- I'll bet it's about me.
- He's gonna kill you, Franklin.

40:40.271 --> 40:44.357
- It probably doesn't mean anything, huh?
- You worry too much.

40:45.317 --> 40:49.112
He couldn't find us anyway.
I mean, he doesn't even know our names.

40:49.196 --> 40:51.739
I gave him your name.
I told him where you live.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.451
I even gave him your zip code.
He's gonna kill you.

40:54.535 --> 40:56.119
Jerry.

40:57.246 --> 41:00.457
- What are you doing?
- I can't find my knife.

41:00.541 --> 41:03.835
That knife won't do you any good.
He likes that knife.

41:03.919 --> 41:06.004
When did you have it last?

41:07.548 --> 41:10.967
Well, I didn't have it last.
You had it last.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.636
I gave it to you. Remember?
What did you do with it?

41:13.721 --> 41:16.139
I don't know.
Didn't I give it back to you?

41:16.223 --> 41:19.309
No. I didn't have it
when I got out of the van.

41:19.393 --> 41:24.147
- You just never gave it back to me.
- All right, I'll look for it.

41:24.231 --> 41:28.693
I think I'll walk down to the creek
before it gets too dark. How do I get there?

41:28.777 --> 41:33.198
Well, there's a trail down there
between them two old sheds.

41:33.282 --> 41:36.534
- Can I go, too?
- I think you'd better stay here.

41:37.661 --> 41:39.662
All right.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.297
I can't find it.

41:56.555 --> 41:59.015
Are you mad at me?

41:59.099 --> 42:01.601
No, I'm not mad at you.

42:04.855 --> 42:06.940
You really are mad, huh?

42:08.442 --> 42:10.944
Oh, I don't blame you.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.278
I'm...

42:12.363 --> 42:14.155
Kirk!

42:24.291 --> 42:27.919
You really didn't want me to come,
did you?

42:28.003 --> 42:31.297
Oh, Franklin, I'm just tired.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.591
It's been a long day.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.223
Sally, did you believe in all that stuff

42:40.307 --> 42:45.061
that Pam was telling about
Saturn and retrograde and all that?

42:45.145 --> 42:49.482
I don't know.
Everything means something, I guess.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.025
Yeah.

42:54.989 --> 42:58.074
You don't think that guy
would try and follow us, do you?

42:58.158 --> 43:01.786
Well, I mean, there's no way
that he could follow us.

43:05.040 --> 43:08.209
He's probably afraid Kirk will kill him.

43:14.717 --> 43:15.883
Sally?

43:15.968 --> 43:18.052
What now?

43:21.348 --> 43:23.057
Nothing.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.562
Never mind.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.402
Kirk!

44:04.391 --> 44:05.892
Hello?

44:09.897 --> 44:11.898
Is anybody home?

44:15.944 --> 44:18.488
Excuse me, I'm looking for some friends.

44:18.572 --> 44:20.073
Hello?

44:25.204 --> 44:27.246
Is anybody here?

44:30.417 --> 44:31.918
Damn.

44:49.103 --> 44:50.436
Kirk?

44:51.772 --> 44:55.483
- Are you guys in there?

44:57.444 --> 45:01.030
Hey, guys, quit playing games.
Quit goofing on me.

45:09.581 --> 45:11.624
Pam, is that you?

45:15.462 --> 45:17.463
OK, you guys.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.928
Come on out. Come on!

45:35.315 --> 45:36.816
Kirk?

47:36.019 --> 47:39.939
They must be lost.
They don't have a flashlight or anything.

47:40.023 --> 47:43.317
If they're not back in a minute,
we've got to go look for them.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.903
Well, what if we get lost, too?

47:47.447 --> 47:50.366
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station
and get help.

47:50.450 --> 47:53.452
I'm not leaving here without Jerry.

47:55.122 --> 47:57.164
Jerry!

47:58.625 --> 48:00.835
Jerry!

48:00.919 --> 48:03.337
Jerry!

48:04.923 --> 48:08.342
Jerry!

48:09.386 --> 48:11.596
- Jerry!
- Jerry!

48:12.556 --> 48:14.140
Hey!

48:18.312 --> 48:21.606
They'll probably be back in a minute or so.

48:22.900 --> 48:26.068
Sally, we ought to go to that gas station.

48:28.697 --> 48:30.364
Sally?

48:31.742 --> 48:34.076
I think we ought to go.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.498
Are the keys in the van?

48:41.835 --> 48:46.172
- Could I see the flashlight for a minute?
- What for?

48:46.256 --> 48:49.884
Let me see the flashlight. I'll go
look for them. You don't have to go.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.720
Sally, don't go.
I don't think that's a good idea.

48:52.804 --> 48:58.017
I don't think you ought to go.
I'm going to honk the horn one more time.

48:58.101 --> 49:00.102
- Just give me the flashlight.
- No.

49:00.187 --> 49:04.565
Now, I'm gonna honk the horn,
and we're gonna wait a minute,

49:04.650 --> 49:07.443
and then if they don't come, we'll go.

49:07.527 --> 49:09.528
All right?

49:14.952 --> 49:18.454
Sally, they took the keys.
We don't have any keys.

49:18.538 --> 49:21.415
They took the keys with them.

49:21.500 --> 49:25.336
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it! Franklin!

49:25.420 --> 49:28.422
- Jerry took the keys with him!
- Give me that flashlight!

49:28.507 --> 49:32.885
No, Sally, we can't go! Look, what if
they came back and we weren't here?

49:32.970 --> 49:36.847
- Give me that flashlight!
- No, I've got to take the flashlight.

49:36.932 --> 49:41.560
- I'm gonna go look for them.
- All right, all right, I'll go with you.

49:41.645 --> 49:45.606
No, Sally. Come on, I'll go with you,
but I'm gonna keep the flashlight.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.359
- Give me the flashlight!
- Look, I'll go with you.

49:48.443 --> 49:51.529
I can't push you down that hill!

49:51.613 --> 49:55.491
Sally, look, I know. Oh!

49:55.575 --> 50:00.246
- I'll go with you, but I'm going to hold...
- Never mind, I'll just go without it.

50:01.289 --> 50:06.544
All right, all right. Sally, wait!
Sally, wait a minute! I'm coming with you.

50:06.628 --> 50:09.755
Sally? Hold up a minute now.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.841
All right, let's go.

50:11.925 --> 50:14.010
Let's go. I'll go with you.

50:15.220 --> 50:17.930
Sally, I can't keep up with you.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.016
Sally?

50:20.100 --> 50:22.268
Sally, wait a minute.

50:28.775 --> 50:30.776
Hold up.

50:38.952 --> 50:42.747
Jerry!

50:42.831 --> 50:54.091
Jerry!

50:55.469 --> 50:57.219
Jerry!

50:57.971 --> 51:01.724
Jerry!

51:07.314 --> 51:09.482
Wait.

51:09.566 --> 51:13.903
- I thought I heard something.
- There's a light.

51:13.987 --> 51:15.988
- Yeah?
- Yes.

51:17.324 --> 51:20.576
Oh, it looks like a house.

51:20.660 --> 51:23.954
Well, come on, push.
Come on, push.

51:24.039 --> 51:26.540
Push down. There.

51:32.172 --> 51:36.383
- It's a house.
- Yeah? I can't see it very well.

51:36.468 --> 51:39.720
Oh, Franklin, this is impossible.

51:39.805 --> 51:42.723
Come on, Sally.

51:42.808 --> 51:45.601
Get back and push down.

51:45.685 --> 51:47.728
This is impossible.

51:50.857 --> 51:52.942
I hear something out there.

51:54.361 --> 51:55.820
Look.

51:59.449 --> 52:01.617
- Hey, Jerry!
- Jerry!

52:01.701 --> 52:03.744
Jerry!

52:11.294 --> 52:13.629
Sally, I hear something.
Stop. Stop.

54:19.339 --> 54:21.340
Somebody, please!

54:22.175 --> 54:23.968
Help!

54:25.220 --> 54:27.429
Help me, please!

54:29.641 --> 54:32.518
Somebody, help me!

54:58.211 --> 55:10.306
Help!

55:10.390 --> 55:12.891
Please! Please! Please help me!

55:13.560 --> 55:15.060
Please!

57:46.421 --> 57:48.922
Help! Help me!

57:49.007 --> 57:50.591
Help!

57:53.553 --> 57:55.888
Help! Help!

57:55.972 --> 57:57.264
Help!

57:59.225 --> 58:01.977
Help! Help me!

58:02.061 --> 58:05.272
Help me! Oh, God!
Help, help!

58:05.356 --> 58:08.150
Close the door. Help me.

58:08.234 --> 58:10.777
Whoa, there, whoa, whoa.

58:10.862 --> 58:13.655
- Come over here.
- Somebody's trying to kill me.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.575
Help, help...

58:16.659 --> 58:19.161
Calm down. You're all right, you're OK.

58:19.245 --> 58:21.788
- Oh, now, take it easy.
- Call the police.

58:21.873 --> 58:24.041
- He might come.
- Now, what happened?

58:24.125 --> 58:28.128
- He... he... he killed...
- Now, now, take it easy.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.173
He killed Franklin.
I don't know. Call the police!

58:31.257 --> 58:34.551
- Take it easy.
- And Jerry.

58:34.636 --> 58:37.971
I... I don't-I don't know
what happened to the others.

58:38.056 --> 58:40.265
There's nobody out there now.

58:40.350 --> 58:43.268
Come on. Come on now, take it easy.
Come on, take it easy.

58:43.353 --> 58:46.021
- Oh, please.
- What happened?

58:46.105 --> 58:49.691
Please. Call the police.

58:49.776 --> 58:52.778
There's no phone here.

58:52.904 --> 58:57.533
We... we have to drive over to Childress.

58:57.617 --> 59:00.202
Yeah, yeah.
Now, you take it easy.

59:00.286 --> 59:03.205
Take it easy now. I'll get the truck.

59:03.289 --> 59:06.041
- Now, now, take it easy. Take it easy.
- Don't go.

59:06.125 --> 59:08.544
Take it easy.

59:16.344 --> 59:20.180
Weather is expected to
be warm to partly cloudy tomorrow

59:20.265 --> 59:22.683
with no chance of precipitation.

59:22.767 --> 59:26.436
The high today will be in the upper 90s
and a low tonight of 81 degrees.

59:26.521 --> 59:30.566
Current temperature is 96 with winds
out the southeast at three miles a hour.

59:30.650 --> 59:34.361
Humidity 98,
barometer is at 29.9 and rising.

59:34.445 --> 59:38.532
Acting on a tip,
the Muerto County sheriff's office

59:38.616 --> 59:42.619
began an investigation early this morning
in the Muerto County Cemetery

59:42.704 --> 59:45.914
opening crypts where there was
evidence of tampering.

59:45.999 --> 59:51.003
The sheriff's deputies found a reported
dozen coffins robbed of their contents.

59:51.087 --> 59:52.754
According to the sheriff,

59:52.839 --> 59:56.550
there were cadavers in which the heads
and extremities were removed,

59:56.634 --> 01:00:01.513
and others in which only a hand or foot
had been removed.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:04.433
Maldonado has information
linking the robberies

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:08.437
to a large and well-organized
West Coast jewel theft ring

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:13.609
but declined to suggest any reason
for them to mutilate the cadavers.

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:36.798
- What are you doing?
- You ain't got no need to worry.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:37.924
No!

01:00:38.009 --> 01:00:41.970
You just cooperate, young lady,
and we'll have no trouble.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:45.766
- Now, listen...
- What do you want?

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:51.355
Now, there's no need to do that.
Nobody's going to hurt you.

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:52.898
No!

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:10.165
No! No! No!

01:02:59.525 --> 01:03:01.735
Had to lock up and get the lights.

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:05.864
Cost of electricity is enough to
drive a man out of business.

01:03:34.852 --> 01:03:37.938
Uh, I hope you're not
too uncomfortable down there.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:48.657
You got nothing to worry about. You just
take it easy, and we'll be there soon.

01:03:52.662 --> 01:03:56.498
Now, now, now, now.

01:03:56.582 --> 01:03:59.751
There's no need to do that, no.

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.823
We'll be over this in a bit.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:32.868
Hang on.

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.086
Halfwits.

01:04:48.801 --> 01:04:51.136
Little coon shits.

01:04:58.185 --> 01:05:01.730
Come here, you nap-haired idiot!

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:04.900
- Where have you been?
- I've been out on the road.

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:08.945
You damn fool,
you almost got caught over at Duke's.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:12.115
No, no, they didn't see me.
They don't know nothing.

01:05:12.199 --> 01:05:15.744
I told you to stay away from that graveyard!

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:58.078
I told you and I told you,

01:05:58.162 --> 01:06:01.957
I told you never to leave your brother alone,
you...

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:06.461
Get in there and get that girl out of the car.
Come on, get her out of the car.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:10.382
Get her out of there.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:13.843
Hopefully your brother
didn't let any of those kids get away.

01:06:13.928 --> 01:06:16.805
Get her in there.
We'll have the whole county out here.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:19.391
Don't you got any self-respect?

01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:25.146
Look what your brother did to the door!

01:06:25.231 --> 01:06:28.149
He's got no pride in his home?

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.235
Get her in there.

01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:38.576
You've been a fool, you!

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:42.122
You better get them other kids.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:44.624
Where are they, huh?

01:06:56.762 --> 01:06:58.596
You're a damn fool, you.

01:07:03.978 --> 01:07:05.437
Oh!

01:07:05.521 --> 01:07:07.856
I thought you was in a hurry.

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:15.405
Where are the kids?
Where are they? Show me!

01:07:19.952 --> 01:07:23.079
- None of 'em get away?
- Uh-uh-uh.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.790
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

01:07:30.588 --> 01:07:32.047
You...

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:36.342
You damn fool! You ruined the door!

01:07:45.978 --> 01:07:48.188
Hey, you did good. She's a nice girl.

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:52.400
You nitwit, get upstairs
and get your grandpa.

01:08:08.667 --> 01:08:12.837
Now, now, young lady,
you just take it easy there now.

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:16.841
Look, we'll fix you some supper
in a few minutes. Huh?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.720
Get back in there!

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.143
Get in there!

01:08:32.316 --> 01:08:34.901
Now, you just take it easy.

01:08:34.984 --> 01:08:36.986
Take it easy.

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:40.657
We'll have you something to eat
right away.

01:09:06.767 --> 01:09:08.725
Hey.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.895
Hey, Leatherface.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:13.356
Give me a hand with Grandpa.

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:30.622
Careful.

01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.788
Look, Grandpa, look, look.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:39.901
Here, here!

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:26.966
Shut up!

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:28.801
Quiet!

01:12:29.553 --> 01:12:31.596
You act like a pack of hounds.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.265
We were just having fun.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.642
You think this is a party?

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.936
Please.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.440
You can make them stop.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.817
No, he can't.

01:12:44.902 --> 01:12:47.320
Shut your mouths.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.823
Can't be helped, young lady.

01:12:50.908 --> 01:12:54.285
- Oh, please, you can't let them kill me.
- Shut up.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.412
Don't pay him no mind.

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:05.338
You like this face?

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:22.897
You're crazy!
You've got to make them stop!

01:13:23.982 --> 01:13:24.941
Please!

01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:27.568
He's nothing. He's just the cook.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.239
Shut up, you bitch hog.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:36.494
Me and Leatherface do all the work.
He don't like it.

01:13:36.578 --> 01:13:38.955
Ain't that right?
You're just the cook!

01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:41.916
Shut your mouth!

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.253
You don't understand nothing.

01:13:45.337 --> 01:13:49.048
I understand you ain't nothing.
Me and him do all the work!

01:13:49.133 --> 01:13:51.968
I just can't take no pleasure in killing.

01:13:55.264 --> 01:14:00.560
Well, there's just some things you got
to do. Don't mean you have to like it.

01:14:00.644 --> 01:14:03.479
Oh, please. Please.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:07.692
What do you want?
I'll do anything. Anything.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:13.698
I'll do... I'll do anything you want.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:20.181
Don't need to torture the poor girl.

01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:24.560
You just shut up! Remember you're just
the cook, and me and him will handle this.

01:15:24.645 --> 01:15:27.730
Then get on with it.
I won't have this.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:34.695
We ain't in no hurry
because you ain't going no place.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:36.531
No.

01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:40.201
You hear me?
It might hurt you, but it don't mean much.

01:15:43.455 --> 01:15:45.665
No sense in waiting.

01:15:45.749 --> 01:15:47.917
I got to open up the room.

01:15:48.877 --> 01:15:54.006
I been... I been thinking about
letting Grandpa have some fun.

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:56.300
You always said he's the best.

01:15:56.385 --> 01:15:58.386
He's the best, all right.

01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:04.684
Let's let him have a whack. Hey, Grandpa,
we going to let you have this one.

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:16.612
Just let him have a whack.

01:16:19.491 --> 01:16:23.786
Now, you just hush.
It won't hurt none.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:29.250
Why, old Grandpa is the best killer
there ever was.

01:16:29.334 --> 01:16:32.878
Why, it never took more than one lick,
they say.

01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:36.173
Why, he did 60 in five minutes once.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.635
They say he could've done more
if the hook and pull gang

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:43.556
could've gotten the beeves
out of the way faster.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:46.684
Now, now, don't you cry none.

01:16:46.768 --> 01:16:49.437
Old Grandpa's the best.
It won't hurt a bit.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:55.443
No! No!

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:05.328
No! No!

01:17:05.412 --> 01:17:09.457
No! Oh, please don't!

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:12.918
Please! Please! Please don't!

01:17:13.003 --> 01:17:15.212
No, no! No!

01:17:25.265 --> 01:17:26.724
No!

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.436
Hit her, Grandpa!

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:37.068
Hit her, Grandpa!

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.654
Hit her! Come on, Grandpa.

01:17:41.698 --> 01:17:43.699
Hit her!

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:47.119
Hit that bitch.

01:17:47.788 --> 01:17:49.872
Hit her, Grandpa!

01:17:50.832 --> 01:17:52.833
Come on!

01:17:56.171 --> 01:17:58.172
Come on, Grandpa, hit that bitch.

01:17:58.256 --> 01:18:01.676
Careful there. Come on, Grandpa.

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:05.179
Get her Grandpa, get her.

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:08.182
Go ahead, go ahead! Get her!

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:22.196
Come on.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.825
- Give me the hammer. I'll get her.
- Get her, get her, Grandpa.

01:18:25.909 --> 01:18:29.203
- Give me that hammer.
- Hit her, hit her, Grandpa.

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:32.164
- I'll kill her. Let me get her.
- Hit the bitch.

01:19:54.289 --> 01:19:56.457
Help!

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.141
Help!

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.789
Go!

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:21.125
