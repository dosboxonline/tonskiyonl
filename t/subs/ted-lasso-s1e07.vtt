WEBVTT

00:05.506 --> 00:09.426
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:09.801 --> 00:12.971
No, Trevor, no.
The bag has to go all the way in, okay?

00:13.055 --> 00:15.140
Use all the space. Out the way. Thank you.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.061
What's gone on back here? Right.

00:19.686 --> 00:24.483
These need to be moved around, 'cause
this is gonna jiggle about, otherwise.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.485
Now, can we move-- Hello?

00:26.568 --> 00:29.446
There's someone in here. Oh, my God.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.907
Hey, almost forgot. You know
how we're playing Everton tomorrow?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.242
-Yeah.
-Well, that's not a town.

00:33.325 --> 00:37.412
-It's actually a team in Liverpool!
-Like the Beatles!

00:37.496 --> 00:41.708
If you see John, Paul, George or Ringo,
will you take a picture, please?

00:41.792 --> 00:42.835
Hey, you got it, big guy.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.587
Okay, hey,
I better get a roll on here, all right?

00:45.671 --> 00:48.131
Okay. And Mom wants to talk to you.
Hold on.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.716
-I love you, buddy.
-Love you too.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.426
Still haven't told him
John and George are dead?

00:51.510 --> 00:52.594
They're what?

00:52.678 --> 00:54.221
It was Keith Richards.

00:54.930 --> 00:55.931
Hey, Ted.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.140
-Hey. How you doing?
-Good.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.809
How's work going? Everything all right?

00:58.892 --> 01:02.938
Yeah. I'm sorry. I know this isn't easy,
but the paperwork the lawyer sent?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.647
I know. Oh, hey.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.525
Got it right here.

01:06.608 --> 01:10.112
I'll, uh, look it all over, sign it,
send it right back. I promise.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.948
Okay, thanks. Hey, good luck tomorrow.
We'll be watching.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.032
All right now.

01:24.877 --> 01:25.961
Whoo-hoo!

01:26.044 --> 01:29.381
-Girls' trip!
-Mm. Liverpool, here we come.

01:29.464 --> 01:30.507
I just want to say up front

01:30.591 --> 01:32.718
that I'm really flattered
you asked me to come this weekend.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.553
Oh. Come on now.

01:34.636 --> 01:38.015
But, hey, we're both single.
I think you are super hot.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.892
If I'm gonna dip my toe back
into the lady pool,

01:39.975 --> 01:42.728
I can't think of a finer body of water
to do it with than you.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.646
No. Keeley, I think you're confused.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.149
I was, at first.
Then I was like, "Come on, Keeley.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.444
Blow off some steam and have
some wicked sex with your new friend."

01:52.446 --> 01:53.655
I'm fucking with you.

01:54.281 --> 01:55.282
Oh, my God.

01:55.908 --> 01:58.535
I thought you were being serious.
I mean, can you imagine?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.745
Oh, I have.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.789
Do-da do-da do do do do doo

02:02.873 --> 02:05.667
Looks like we have a new passenger
on today's flight.

02:05.751 --> 02:07.961
Actually, Keeley will be taking your seat
on the jet, Higgins.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.463
Oh.

02:09.544 --> 02:10.797
Sorry.

02:10.881 --> 02:12.841
I'm gonna go spend a penny
before we take off.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.176
See you downstairs, Rebecca.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.179
Oh, that's okay. I always
enjoy the antics on the team bus.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.348
No. I need you to stay here this weekend.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.558
Doing work that doesn't matter.

02:27.523 --> 02:30.984
All right, gentlemen. Who's ready
to go show Everton what we got?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.403
Whoo!

02:33.946 --> 02:35.072
Thank you, Dani.

02:35.531 --> 02:39.743
Jeez, Louise.
Why's everybody so down in the dumps?

02:39.826 --> 02:42.162
What happened?
Did BeyoncÃ© dump Jay-Z or something?

02:42.246 --> 02:43.288
No, nothing like that.

02:43.372 --> 02:47.334
Thank goodness. Just saying it out loud
made me immediately sad.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.710
Let me see what's going on here.

02:48.794 --> 02:52.256
Hey, guys. Seriously, come on.
Talk to me. What's up?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.341
Well, we're fine.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.425
Mm.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.886
-Yeah, I'm all right.
-Okay.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.931
We're in a shit fucking mood because
we never fucking win at Everton

03:01.014 --> 03:02.850
and it sucks fucking shit!

03:03.350 --> 03:04.768
Ah, come on, fellas.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.895
How long has it been
since y'all won up at Everton?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.356
-Sixty years ago.
-Jesus Christ.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.693
Wow. That is a heck of a long time. Okay.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.361
So we got that going on.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.322
And obviously we're bummed out
that O'Brien tore his butt.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.949
It's my upper hamstring, Coach.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.494
You tore your butt, son. There's nothing
to be ashamed of, okay? It happens.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.455
People tear their butts all the time
in athletics. You're not alone, man.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.375
Hey, Coach,
you've torn your butt a few times, right?

03:28.458 --> 03:29.793
-Three times.
-Three times.

03:30.252 --> 03:33.630
Butt's an amazing muscle.
God as my witness, your butt will heal.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.049
The silver lining here,
with O'Brien's tore butt,

03:36.133 --> 03:39.219
is that my man from Montreal is
gonna be filling in at goalie.

03:39.303 --> 03:42.097
-Give it up for Zorro.
-Oh. It's pronounced, um, "Zoreaux."

03:42.181 --> 03:44.892
-I'm sorry. Zorro.
-"Zoreaux."

03:44.975 --> 03:47.394
You-- I don't know
what I'm doing wrong here.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.605
Point is, gentlemen,
unless one of y'all got a crystal ball,

03:49.688 --> 03:51.273
we don't know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.733
That's why we play the game.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.903
So let me hear it! Richmond on three!
One, two, three!

03:55.986 --> 03:57.905
-Richmond!
-Right, come on. Let's go.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.993
-Hey, Coach.
-Howdy, fellas. How can I help you?

04:03.076 --> 04:05.954
Um, so, uh, since Jamie Tartt
has gone back to Man City,

04:06.038 --> 04:08.832
uh, you've lost one, you've drawn one,
you've not scored any goals.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.917
-Yeah.
-So I'm wondering,

04:10.000 --> 04:12.252
how worried are you
about the threat of relegation?

04:13.045 --> 04:16.548
Lloyd, right now I'm mostly concerned
with the definition of relegation.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.259
What you got for me, Marcus?

04:19.343 --> 04:22.053
Just wanted to know how you're feeling
about the departure of Jamie Tartt.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.722
Yeah. Um...

04:23.805 --> 04:26.517
Well, if I'm being honest,
it, uh, breaks my heart a little.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.769
I think one of the neatest things
about being a coach

04:28.852 --> 04:30.854
is the connection you get to make
with your players.

04:30.938 --> 04:34.066
That's a loss that hits me a lot harder
and is gonna stay with me a lot longer

04:34.149 --> 04:36.652
than anything that happens
while playing a game on a patch of grass.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.029
All right.
See you fellas in Liverpool, yeah?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.239
Yeah.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.826
Oh. Hey!
Last one there is a Scotch egg! Whoo!

04:46.495 --> 04:47.496
What?

05:00.968 --> 05:02.344
Hey, there he is.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.270
-Good to see you, buddy.
-All right, let's go.

05:38.505 --> 05:41.592
Here we go. It's the presidential suite.
Hope it's to your satisfaction.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.136
Would you like me to show you
the various room amenities?

05:44.219 --> 05:45.762
No, thank you.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
My lady and I wanna have
a quick shag and a shower

05:47.931 --> 05:49.266
before we hit the town tonight.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.101
Welcome to Liverpool.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.315
What? He would've spent
a cash tip in, like, a minute.

05:56.398 --> 05:59.109
Come on. The image I just gave him
is gonna last for a lifetime.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.237
No, it's-- it's not you. It's-- Oh, fuck.

06:02.321 --> 06:05.741
This is Rupert's and my
anniversary weekend. And--

06:07.075 --> 06:09.286
-It's the first one I've spent by myself--
-Hey, it's okay.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.083
Thank you.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.171
-Mm.
-Ooh. That's a long hug.

06:20.881 --> 06:24.593
So, just to remind you,
the hotel furniture stays in the rooms,

06:24.676 --> 06:27.137
not the hallway or the pool.

06:27.221 --> 06:32.601
Nor are you allowed to ship it
to your homes or other hotels, okay?

06:32.684 --> 06:34.645
All right, fellas,
we got team meal in an hour.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.272
After that, it's either gonna be
movie night or a pillow fight.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.607
What's it gonna be this time around?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.150
Movie night.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.403
All right. But I tell you what,
y'all say "pillow fight" one time,

06:43.487 --> 06:45.030
and we'll never watch another movie
together again.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.323
-That's for you, Coach.
-Thank you, sir.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.033
-And that's for you.
-Thank you.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.953
Whoo! Room 5150. Finally.

06:51.036 --> 06:54.414
Sammy Hagar,
greatest lead singer in Van Halen history.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.125
-In the post-David Lee Roth era.
-Thank you.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.961
-Coach, what room you got?
-5148.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.421
-Hey.
-Howdy, neighbor.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.342
Yes, hello. We still haven't received
the champagne I ordered. Thank you.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.262
Ah. Good question. One second.

07:08.345 --> 07:12.349
Should I get the concierge to make us
a reservation somewhere tonight?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.185
Shipley's steak house is unmatched
in its cuisine and ambience.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.354
Mm. Is it now? Cool, I can do steak.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.065
Uh, yes. The steak house for two, please.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.943
Does 8:00 p.m. work for you?

07:23.026 --> 07:26.238
The business center is open
24 hours a day.

07:26.321 --> 07:27.322
Okay.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.117
What was that about the business center?

07:30.200 --> 07:32.703
Guests also have access
to our state-of-the-art gym,

07:32.786 --> 07:35.455
filled with the latest
in workout technology.

07:35.539 --> 07:36.540
Like kettlebells!

07:36.623 --> 07:37.916
Oh, my God.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.252
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

07:40.335 --> 07:45.424
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

07:46.008 --> 07:47.885
I don't even remember doing this.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.345
-And if you're the artsy type--
-Right, enough.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.514
This weekend is moving forward.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.976
When that champagne arrives, we are
going to get drunk, have a nice meal,

07:56.059 --> 07:57.477
and leave the past in the past.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.730
-Sound good?
-Sounds fucking great.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.023
Oh. Speak of the devil.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.236
Hello, Stinky.

08:08.405 --> 08:12.743
Still giving you the big room even
without old gray walnuts footing the bill.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.870
Good. Fuck Rupert!

08:15.913 --> 08:19.166
Oh. Who's this then?
Is this your concubine? Is she Russian?

08:19.249 --> 08:22.085
-Are you Russian?
-A, I love you. B, who are you?

08:22.628 --> 08:26.965
Let me introduce Flo Collins,
my best mate since we were little.

08:27.049 --> 08:30.010
Brilliant child psychologist
and proud, newly single...

08:30.093 --> 08:30.969
Mm-hmm.

08:31.053 --> 08:34.472
...mother to the most amazing 12-year-old
little girl called Nora, my goddaughter.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.474
Wow.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.477
Both of whom I've completely neglected
to speak to in the last six years.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.562
Oh, Jesus, Stinky.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.565
Remind me to bury you in the set list
for speeches at my funeral.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.069
Hi, I'm Flo. Or you can call me "Sassy."
I don't care which.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.112
So, you heard about the divorce?

08:49.196 --> 08:53.325
Yeah. I bumped into Derren at a party.
He told me right after he hit on me.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.995
Hey, what's new? Still, weird order
for him to roll out that information.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.206
Right,
what's in the plan for tonight, then?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.999
Shall I call down? Get myself a robe?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.084
Oh!

09:02.793 --> 09:04.127
Look what I've got.

09:04.628 --> 09:05.879
Ta-da!

09:05.963 --> 09:07.506
Stole it off
a room service trolley outside.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.799
You're amazing!

09:09.883 --> 09:11.927
-I'm Keeley, by the way. Hi!
-Oh!

09:12.010 --> 09:13.095
Yeah, I know who you are, honey.

09:13.178 --> 09:15.430
My ex used to masturbate to you
like a maniac, so...

09:29.862 --> 09:32.614
Am I cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs
thinking we can beat these guys tomorrow?

09:32.698 --> 09:34.992
-No, we match up perfectly.
-Exactly.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.952
What about you, Nate?
You believe these guys can win?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.745
I believe this team can do anything.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.539
See? There you go.
That's what I'm talking about.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.166
Okay, Nate. So if you were me,
what would you tell these guys?

09:43.250 --> 09:44.543
Oh, no. I wouldn't-- No, I don't--

09:44.626 --> 09:47.754
Hey. I'm just asking for your opinion.
You understand that, yeah?

09:48.088 --> 09:49.548
-Yeah.
-And you got one, yes?

09:49.631 --> 09:51.592
-Yeah.
-Locked, loaded, ready to rip?

09:51.675 --> 09:53.010
Mm-hmm.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.136
-Let me hear it.
-No.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.638
Why not? What are you afraid's
gonna happen if you tell me?

09:56.722 --> 09:58.557
That you won't like my idea
and it makes you hate me.

09:58.640 --> 09:59.516
Then you fire me.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.852
Then I have to move back in with my
parents and they'll be ashamed of me.

10:01.935 --> 10:04.563
Then everyone finds out back home
and laughs at me until my face melts off.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.522
Excuse me.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.153
Well, at least he didn't stammer.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.780
Mm.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.288
I gotta go take care of a couple things.
I'll see you in the morning, all right?

10:21.371 --> 10:23.373
Hey, do me a favor.
Keep an eye on these guys,

10:23.457 --> 10:27.503
'cause around the 74 minute mark, there's
gonna be a room full of grown men crying.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.463
I'll be one of 'em.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.259
Right, so I hadn't prepared anything.

10:34.343 --> 10:37.471
Not the brightest idea for a maid
of honor, especially with an open bar.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.097
Yeah, she was the star of the weekend.

10:39.181 --> 10:42.059
-Yeah, I gave Elton John a boner.
-You did what?

10:42.142 --> 10:44.394
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did!

10:44.478 --> 10:46.355
He has repeatedly denied that.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.273
Ah. Classic "she said, she said," innit?

10:51.109 --> 10:54.238
Would you ladies like another bottle?
A little dessert perhaps?

10:54.905 --> 10:58.075
My sexy and extremely single friend here

10:58.158 --> 11:01.245
actually prefers her desserts
on the larger side.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.081
If that's something
you could possibly accommodate.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.042
I'll give you a few minutes.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.210
Thank you. Sorry.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.548
I can't believe you just did that.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.132
Oh, shut up. You love it.

11:14.216 --> 11:16.260
Right. I'm going for a smoke. Stinky?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.636
No. Don't smoke anymore.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.306
And yet, you're still on fire.

11:22.307 --> 11:23.475
Hmm.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.564
Yeah, I don't know. Just--

11:29.565 --> 11:33.527
May I suggest flushing it again
but harder? Okay, bye.

11:34.862 --> 11:35.946
Hi, how can I help you?

11:36.029 --> 11:38.198
Hey, how you doing? I was
wondering if y'all had a fax machine.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.284
Fax machine?

11:41.535 --> 11:45.289
Oh, okay. Um, that's a good question.
If you bear with me a second,

11:45.372 --> 11:47.875
I'll just check with a colleague
and see what I can find out.

11:47.958 --> 11:51.753
A fax machine, hey? Are you
sending something to the year 1997?

11:51.837 --> 11:54.256
Yeah, just a little note to myself
telling me to buy Apple stock.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.799
Oh. Good idea.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.011
Can you tell me to murder J.K. Rowling and
write the first Harry Potter book as well?

11:59.469 --> 12:02.014
Can do. Yeah. I'll probably write "handle"
instead of "murder,"

12:02.097 --> 12:03.515
so there's no paper trail.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.226
-Yeah, I'm Ted, by the way.
-Oh. Sassy.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.395
Sassy, huh? Like the Smurf, right?

12:09.479 --> 12:11.148
Don't think there was a Sassy Smurf,
was there?

12:11.231 --> 12:12.232
That's too bad.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.860
Seems like a Smurf with an attitude
would've been a lot of fun to watch.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.363
All right, yeah, I'll tell him.
Let me know how the trial goes. Okay, bye.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.658
Right, we no longer have a fax machine
on the premises.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.911
But the concierge was able to locate one

12:23.994 --> 12:27.414
at a tanning salon eight miles away
in Croxteth.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.707
You know what, that's okay.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.793
I'm just gonna hit this manicurist
nearby that has carrier pigeons.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.255
-Thank you though. All right.
-Okay.

12:35.839 --> 12:36.924
Nice meeting you.

12:37.674 --> 12:38.759
Right, how can I help you?

12:38.842 --> 12:40.844
Well, I was gonna go out for a smoke

12:40.928 --> 12:43.096
and hope my friend picks up the check
while I was gone.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.892
Then I saw Magnum, P.I. in line,
figured I'd flirt with him as well.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.603
-See what happens, you know?
-Oh, well, good luck.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.022
Yeah, I think I fucked it.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.944
I-- I actually get off in about 30 minutes
if you'd like to, uh--

12:57.027 --> 12:58.195
Of course not, why would you?

13:00.322 --> 13:02.032
You are who you choose to be.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.454
Superman.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.794
Okay, so I just met
the fucking Marlboro Man in the--

13:13.877 --> 13:16.713
-Where's Stinky gone? She abandoned you?
-No, she just went to pee.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.298
-Oh.
-Where does "Stinky" come from?

13:18.382 --> 13:21.218
I remember the day
she moved into our town.

13:21.301 --> 13:23.262
She was already taller than me,
had bigger boobs.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.390
Family was rich.
So, first day of year seven,

13:26.473 --> 13:29.142
I told everyone her nickname was "Stinky."

13:29.643 --> 13:30.644
That's genius.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.230
To the ties that bind us.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.523
To Rebecca.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.818
Yeah, that's not Rebecca.

13:38.944 --> 13:39.945
How do you mean?

13:40.654 --> 13:42.281
No, the real Rebecca is silly.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.533
Strong, yeah, but not cold.

13:45.284 --> 13:47.494
-Have you ever heard her sing?
-No.

13:47.578 --> 13:49.121
Ah. Beautiful voice.

13:50.122 --> 13:52.207
Her and Nora would sing through
the door for hours.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.293
Do you wanna build a snowman?

13:54.376 --> 13:56.211
-Who's Nora?
-My daughter.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.504
Oh, yeah.

13:57.588 --> 14:00.132
Yeah, if you like that woman,
you are gonna love Rebecca.

14:01.592 --> 14:03.302
-Ready?
-What about the bill?

14:03.385 --> 14:05.888
-Thank you, Miss Welton.
-Okay.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.976
Do you wanna do that thing
where you pretend you wanted to pay?

14:11.059 --> 14:12.936
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This is really good fun. Join in.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.148
Oh, you absolute piece of shit!
I was about to do that!

14:16.231 --> 14:19.067
-I was just about to get my card out.
-I can't believe that you've done this.

14:19.151 --> 14:22.112
-We were gonna split. That was so nice.
-Six years I've waited for this...

15:10.619 --> 15:13.038
-What the hell are you doing?
-I'm-- I'm so sorry. I just--

15:13.121 --> 15:14.122
You're what?

15:14.831 --> 15:17.084
-What is this?
-It's just my thoughts on the team.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.253
Go, Nathan. Come on, it's past curfew.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.796
-Go! Get outta here!
-Sorry.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.773
Liverpool has much to offer
when it comes to nightlife.

15:39.857 --> 15:45.571
From pubs and clubs,
to the great Asian pastime of karaoke!

15:45.654 --> 15:50.033
And if you're the artsy type,
or you're just trying to impress a date,

15:50.117 --> 15:51.952
Liverpool has more
museums and galleries...

15:52.703 --> 15:56.164
Welcome to Goodison Park.
I'm Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

15:56.248 --> 15:58.959
-Okay, guys! Got some snacks here!
-Whoo-hoo!

15:59.042 --> 16:02.379
Let's try not to eat them all
in the first half. Come on, Richmond!

16:02.462 --> 16:05.048
It's eighth-place Everton
hosting AFC Richmond,

16:05.132 --> 16:08.010
in 18th and staring relegation
in the face.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.220
The last time Richmond left here
with a win,

16:10.304 --> 16:14.975
the number one song in the UK
was by Elvis Presley, "It's Now or Never."

16:15.058 --> 16:18.478
And that's certainly the case
for Ted Lasso's men tonight.

16:19.354 --> 16:21.481
-Nate, can I speak with you, please?
-Yeah.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.279
You all right?

16:27.362 --> 16:31.575
I wanted to apologize for last night.
I bit your head off for no good reason,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.785
and I'm really sorry about that
and I hope you can forgive me.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.330
Yeah, of cour-- Yes, of course.

16:36.413 --> 16:40.959
Thank you.
Also, I read through your thoughts.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.961
-Yeah.
-They're great.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.548
And I agree with every last one of 'em.

16:46.632 --> 16:48.509
But I can't say this to them.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.594
-But they need to hear it.
-I agree.

16:51.386 --> 16:52.513
That's why you're gonna do it.

16:53.555 --> 16:54.556
Are you drunk?

16:54.640 --> 16:57.267
You're giving the pregame talk,
and you're gonna read them this.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.522
-I ju-- I don't know.
-It'll be fun.

17:03.524 --> 17:05.025
No. No, no, no.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.319
Oh, my God.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.154
All right, listen up, fellas.

17:09.238 --> 17:12.031
As of late, I feel like y'all
have heard enough of my jibber-jabber.

17:12.115 --> 17:15.367
So I asked Nate the Great here to
jot down a few of his thoughts and ideas

17:15.452 --> 17:17.162
about you guys and today's game.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.372
So let's focus up.

17:18.454 --> 17:20.082
-All yours, Nate.
-Okay.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.967
-Let's go, Nate.
-Come on, boy. You got this.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.053
-You got this, Nate. It's okay.
-Okay. Thank you. Let's do it.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.307
-Isaac.
-Hmm?

17:39.226 --> 17:41.520
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you got this, bruv, all right?

17:41.603 --> 17:42.646
Yeah.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.064
I've noticed of late...

17:49.236 --> 17:51.363
that you've been playing
like a big, dumb pussy.

17:54.992 --> 17:55.993
Wow.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.328
What the fuck did you say to me, bruv?

17:59.454 --> 18:02.457
You're more concerned about looking tough
than actually being tough.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.668
There's a way to be intimidating
without being physical.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.587
I hope you don't mind me saying.

18:06.670 --> 18:07.921
Um...

18:08.005 --> 18:09.840
-Sam.
-Oh, no.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.800
You're constantly getting beat
on the wings.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.010
It's 'cause you're indecisive.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.845
You second-guess
more than a shitty psychic.

18:15.679 --> 18:17.931
The only African I know more imprisoned
by their own thoughts

18:18.015 --> 18:19.349
is goddamn Nelson Mandela.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.103
Did you hear that?

18:23.187 --> 18:26.064
You think that's funny, do you, Colin?
You and all your fancy step over bullshit.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.608
Let me ask you this.
Do you wax your pubes?

18:28.650 --> 18:29.568
What?

18:29.651 --> 18:31.862
Did I stutter, dickhead?
Do you wax your pubes? Yes or no.

18:31.945 --> 18:32.988
No.

18:33.071 --> 18:35.157
Then why are you always trying to play
like a Brazilian?

18:35.741 --> 18:36.742
Yeah.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.203
What just happened?

18:39.286 --> 18:41.538
-Uh, Rojas.
-Whoo! Roast me, amigo.

18:41.622 --> 18:43.665
All right.
You say that football is life, right?

18:43.749 --> 18:45.250
Football is life.

18:45.334 --> 18:47.753
-Yeah, well, then your defense is death.
-Oh!

18:47.836 --> 18:50.839
The only person I've seen lose their man
more often is Carrie fucking Bradshaw.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.758
Oh!

18:52.841 --> 18:54.635
-Sex and the City.
-Shh.

18:56.595 --> 18:58.263
-Yeah.
-Tough but fair.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.640
Right. Roy.

19:09.608 --> 19:12.236
Go on. Say what you're gonna say.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.780
Okay.

19:17.783 --> 19:19.284
Don't read it.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.870
Say it to my face.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.499
The great Roy Kent.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.335
You're old now.

19:29.795 --> 19:33.173
And slow. And your focus drifts.

19:33.257 --> 19:35.884
But your speed and your smarts
were never what made you who you are.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.763
It's your anger. That's your superpower.

19:39.847 --> 19:42.683
That's what made you one of the best
midfielders in the history of this league.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.561
But I haven't seen it on the pitch
at all this season, Roy.

19:45.644 --> 19:48.272
I mean, you used to run
like you were angry at the grass.

19:48.355 --> 19:51.692
You'd kick the ball like you'd caught it
fucking your wife, for Christ's sake.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.654
But that anger doesn't come out anymore
when you play.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.197
But it's still in there.

19:59.074 --> 20:02.160
And I'm afraid of what it's gonna do to
you if you just keep it all for yourself.

20:23.140 --> 20:24.558
Ooh!

20:28.896 --> 20:30.147
Let's go get these fuckers.

20:36.904 --> 20:38.572
See? Told you it'd be fun.

20:48.290 --> 20:53.629
And the impossible has happened.
Richmond have won at Everton 1-0.

20:53.712 --> 20:57.007
-Yes, Ted! Yeah!
-Thanks to a rare goal from Roy Kent.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.675
Kent was absolutely brilliant today.

20:58.759 --> 20:59.885
He was like a man possessed.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.222
Yeah!

21:03.305 --> 21:05.057
We know we are, we're sure we are.

21:05.140 --> 21:06.808
We're Richmond till we die.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.393
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond...

21:08.477 --> 21:09.561
Oh, my God!

21:10.187 --> 21:11.939
Come on, give us a hug, Nate. Yeah.

21:12.022 --> 21:13.565
-Ted!
-Hey!

21:14.107 --> 21:16.443
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, boss.

21:16.527 --> 21:18.779
Could I, uh, just introduce you to--

21:18.862 --> 21:21.990
-Sassy Smurf!
-Marlboro Man! Oh, my God.

21:22.658 --> 21:24.493
We know we are, we're sure we are...

21:25.911 --> 21:28.288
-I didn't know you were here.
-Surprise!

21:28.372 --> 21:30.290
I've been thinking about you a lot
this weekend.

21:30.374 --> 21:31.834
Oh, yeah? How come?

21:31.917 --> 21:35.504
'Cause you and your crazy hair keep
popping up every time I turn on my TV.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.468
Oi! Listen up!

21:42.219 --> 21:44.429
None of you are going back
to the hotel tonight.

21:44.513 --> 21:48.058
'Cause we did something today that
no one thought we could do, including us!

21:48.141 --> 21:50.060
So, we're going out, we're celebrating,

21:50.143 --> 21:52.479
and we're gonna rub it
in this city's fucking face!

21:55.732 --> 21:58.110
Roy! Roy! Where are we going?

21:59.069 --> 22:00.153
Keeley?

22:03.240 --> 22:05.450
Well, Liverpool has much to offer.

22:05.534 --> 22:09.580
From pubs to clubs
to the great Asian pastime of...

22:09.663 --> 22:14.042
-I said maybe
-Said maybe

22:14.126 --> 22:16.545
You're gonna be the one that saves me

22:16.628 --> 22:19.339
Saves me

22:19.423 --> 22:23.385
And after all

22:24.553 --> 22:29.725
You're my wonderwall

22:30.976 --> 22:32.227
I'm going for a smoke.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.937
-Can I join you?
-Come on.

22:34.771 --> 22:36.648
Thank you, Richmond FC!

22:40.027 --> 22:42.237
So, what's Marlboro Man's story, then?

22:42.321 --> 22:43.947
'Cause I kinda wanna grab him by the ears

22:44.031 --> 22:46.700
and ride that little mustache
like a Jet Ski.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.120
-It's so good to see you, Sass.
-You too, Stinky.

22:52.289 --> 22:54.416
God. You know, today would've been my--

22:54.499 --> 22:57.377
Of course I know.
Why do you think I'm here?

22:59.505 --> 23:00.881
Mate, I'm so sorry.

23:01.757 --> 23:04.968
I'm sorry for disappearing from you,
from Nora.

23:06.803 --> 23:07.804
I really am.

23:07.888 --> 23:10.057
Thank you for saying that.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.433
Mm.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.602
God, that man took so much from me.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.395
No.

23:15.479 --> 23:20.609
Rupert is a horrible man who built
an ivory tower he kept you captive in.

23:20.692 --> 23:25.113
But you climbed every single step
of that tower on your own.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.534
You're the one who stopped
coming home, stopped calling.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.870
Who made a six-year-old girl
wonder what she'd done wrong.

23:32.829 --> 23:34.706
I'll always be your biggest defender,

23:34.790 --> 23:37.793
but you have to own up
to the part that you played.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.461
You're right.

23:39.545 --> 23:41.046
Course I'm right. I'm always right.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.090
You're not always right.
Most of the time you're an arse.

23:43.173 --> 23:45.884
There you are. Fucking hell.
I thought you guys ditched me.

23:45.968 --> 23:47.427
-No!
-As if!

23:47.511 --> 23:51.390
Jesus, I didn't know that
I had abandonment issues till right now.

23:51.473 --> 23:53.100
Come on, Rebecca. Your song's up next.

23:53.183 --> 23:54.101
-What?
-Yeah.

23:54.184 --> 23:55.644
No, I didn't put a song in.

23:55.727 --> 23:58.355
Well, then someone else
must've done it for you.

23:59.439 --> 24:00.774
Who could've done that?

24:00.858 --> 24:03.110
See? You are an arse.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.737
Caught in a bad romance

24:05.821 --> 24:09.658
Ra-ra-ah-ah-ah
Roma-roma-ma

24:09.741 --> 24:11.827
Gaga, ooh-la-la

24:11.910 --> 24:14.288
Want your bad romance

24:18.667 --> 24:19.668
All right, who's next?

24:19.751 --> 24:21.211
Me, me, me.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.298
Your turn, Rebecca. Get on up here.

24:24.381 --> 24:27.134
Thank you. Oh, God.

24:27.217 --> 24:30.470
Okay. Uh, I don't even know
what song I'm singing.

24:30.554 --> 24:34.224
But I would like to dedicate it to
the best friend a girl could ever have.

24:34.308 --> 24:35.976
That is me! She's talking about me!

24:43.025 --> 24:46.028
This is also dedicated
to my goddaughter, Nora.

24:46.653 --> 24:47.654
I love you.

24:50.407 --> 24:53.744
The snow glows white
On the mountain tonight

24:53.827 --> 24:56.622
Not a footprint to be seen

24:57.497 --> 25:03.253
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

25:05.130 --> 25:11.553
The wind is howling
Like this swirling storm inside

25:12.095 --> 25:17.809
Couldn't keep it in
Heaven knows I've tried

25:19.269 --> 25:26.026
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be

25:26.109 --> 25:32.199
Conceal, don't feel
Don't let them know

25:32.282 --> 25:35.577
Well, now they know

25:35.661 --> 25:39.206
Let it go, let it go

25:39.289 --> 25:42.501
Can't hold it back anymore

25:42.584 --> 25:46.129
Let it go, let it go

25:46.213 --> 25:50.217
Turn away and slam the door

25:50.300 --> 25:56.723
I don't care what they're going to say

25:56.807 --> 26:00.727
Let the storm rage on

26:00.811 --> 26:04.731
The cold never bothered me anyway

26:20.122 --> 26:22.165
-Ted.
-Dad?

26:22.666 --> 26:23.667
Ted?

26:25.085 --> 26:26.086
Ted.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.255
It's okay.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.924
It's okay.

26:31.550 --> 26:32.593
Try to breathe.

26:32.676 --> 26:37.097
I can't. I don't know what's going on.
I'm-- I'm sorry.

26:37.181 --> 26:40.559
It's okay. You're having a panic attack.
Just breathe.

26:42.644 --> 26:43.979
Am I going crazy?

26:44.897 --> 26:46.398
No more than anyone else.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.777
All right. You're all right.

26:52.613 --> 26:57.868
There we go. There we go.
There we go. Come on.

26:58.744 --> 26:59.745
Come on.

27:05.876 --> 27:06.960
There we go.

27:07.711 --> 27:09.463
I think I need to call it a night.

27:09.546 --> 27:13.008
Gonna go back to the hotel and
just get a good night's rest, you know?

27:13.091 --> 27:15.010
Would you like me to walk back with you?

27:15.886 --> 27:16.887
Do you want to take my car?

27:16.970 --> 27:19.848
No, no, no. I'm okay.
Thank you though. I appreciate it.

27:19.932 --> 27:21.683
-All right.
-Okay.

27:26.313 --> 27:29.608
Hey, do me a favor. Just, uh, let Beard
know I went back to the hotel.

27:29.691 --> 27:32.236
Of course. You just get home safely.

27:32.319 --> 27:33.654
-Okay, thank you.
-All right.

27:34.446 --> 27:35.697
Okay.

28:52.524 --> 28:55.110
-Excuse me. Very drunk man coming through.
-Yeah.

28:55.194 --> 28:58.447
Guys. Guys, guys, guys. I think
we should take the boys to the pub.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.742
Oh, I am so done, Sass. Sorry.

29:01.825 --> 29:03.911
Think I'm tapping out
for the evening too, actually.

29:03.994 --> 29:08.081
So I have to take 18
young, handsome men all by myself?

29:08.165 --> 29:09.958
Oh, trauma.

29:10.042 --> 29:12.419
-All right then. See you later.
-Bye. I love you.

29:12.503 --> 29:15.422
Amigos, I can't find my tropical shirt.

29:15.506 --> 29:16.507
He's so drunk.

29:16.590 --> 29:18.675
You won't need it, you won't need it.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.427
Right, want a lift back to the hotel?

29:20.511 --> 29:24.765
Oh, no.
Um, I think I'm gonna walk, actually.

29:29.061 --> 29:31.021
Unless you want me to come with you,
'cause that I can do.

29:31.104 --> 29:33.357
-I'm fine. Really.
-Yeah?

29:33.440 --> 29:35.526
Besides, that was yesterday.

29:37.778 --> 29:40.280
-You're wasting valuable time.
-Yeah, yeah. I'm going, I'm going.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.635
Oh, this is me.

30:02.678 --> 30:06.348
I'm sharing a suite with Rebecca.
We've got separate bedrooms though.

30:22.990 --> 30:24.074
Good night.
