08:54.451 --> 08:57.287
Including a romantic dinner
tomorrow night

08:57.370 --> 08:59.831
at the Thai spot on 9th Street
with that branzino.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.584
Ooh, the branzino.
That's a sexy fish.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.544
Okay, and after that,
I'm thinking maybe we

09:04.627 --> 09:06.671
-do a little dancing.
What? What?
-No. No.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.048
I'm gonna have to burst
this fantasy bubble

09:08.131 --> 09:09.341
before I get too depressed.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.176
We can't do tomorrow night.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.429
<i>Sí, se puede.</i>
We can, and we must. Why? Why?

09:14.512 --> 09:17.223
Um, because Deja said that
Malik is in town for 24 hours

09:17.307 --> 09:19.184
and wants to have dinner
with us tomorrow night--

09:19.267 --> 09:22.103
Correction, make dinner for us
tomorrow night.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.563
He wants to make us dinner?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.857
-Mm-hmm.
-What's his game?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.610
I don't know, but it smells
a little branzino to me.

09:28.693 --> 09:30.320
Huh.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.447
Well, maybe it's an apology

09:32.530 --> 09:34.949
for participating
in her secret trip to Boston

09:35.033 --> 09:37.535
and the lying and the... stuff
I don't like to talk about.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.246
I hope it's an apology,
but I don't know.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.874
-Hmm.
-Kind of feel like we need to...

09:42.957 --> 09:44.292
"worst case scenario" this bish.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.503
You go.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.254
Okay.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.131
Well, obviously,

09:50.215 --> 09:52.217
-she's pregnant. Go.
-(scoffs) God.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.719
-They went to Vegas...
-Mm-hmm.

09:54.803 --> 09:56.971
...and eloped
while we were sleeping.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.391
-Not preggo,
just married. You go.
-Okay.

09:59.474 --> 10:02.644
Malik brings out dessert
and there's an engagement ring

10:02.727 --> 10:04.312
in Deja's soufflé,

10:04.396 --> 10:06.815
and he proposes to her
in front of all of us.

10:06.898 --> 10:08.316
He pulls me out
onto the back porch

10:08.400 --> 10:11.861
before he proposes to ask
for permission, and, uh...

10:11.945 --> 10:14.155
I don't know, he chooses
the back porch because

10:14.239 --> 10:16.866
-we've had some
really good talks out there...
-Play the game, Randall.

10:16.950 --> 10:17.992
-Um...
-(knocks on table)

10:18.076 --> 10:20.412
You go.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.539
Deja wants to adopt
Malik's daughter,

10:22.622 --> 10:25.542
and they move in here together
and live with us forever.

10:30.338 --> 10:32.173
-We need a new game.
-Mm-hmm.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.556
-(sighs)
-All right.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.808
What do you think?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.476
Hat or no hat?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.437
Uh, no hat.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.314
Guys in hats are usually trying
to hide their hair, and you have

10:48.398 --> 10:49.733
-great hair.
-Oh.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.443
I really like your curls.

10:51.526 --> 10:53.319
What about my lipstick,
is it too much?

10:53.403 --> 10:56.698
No. (stammers)
You look, um... very nice.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.200
(groans) It's too much.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.493
-Okay.
-(sighs)

11:00.577 --> 11:03.038
-(sighs)
-All right.

11:03.121 --> 11:05.623
-You ready for this?
-Not at all.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.418
-(bell dings)
-Okay, let's see, um...

11:08.501 --> 11:11.004
I have three children,

11:11.087 --> 11:12.881
all the same age,

11:12.964 --> 11:16.051
and I currently
live with my daughter.

11:16.134 --> 11:18.553
-(bell dings)
-Actually, I'm-I'm not divorced.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.680
I'm a widow, actually.

11:20.764 --> 11:23.224
I know, sad, sad, sad.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.352
-(bell dings)
-There was a fire,

11:25.435 --> 11:27.771
and our whole house
burned down. (chuckles)

11:27.854 --> 11:30.690
We lost almost everything.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.692
-(bell dings)
-He didn't even die in the fire.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.194
He died of a heart attack

11:34.277 --> 11:35.695
in the hospital after.

11:35.779 --> 11:37.238
-(bell dings)
-He saved the dog. (chuckles)

11:37.322 --> 11:39.074
-(bell dings)
-They call it a widowmaker.

11:39.157 --> 11:42.202
-(bell dings)
-I wasn't even in the room.
I was eating a candy bar.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.038
-(bell dings)
-I don't think I'm doing great.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.123
Yeah, me neither.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.000
Oh, by the way, I'm Miguel,

11:49.084 --> 11:50.835
and I'm divorced.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.129
I live in a different state
from my kids, and they hate me.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.881
Oh, hi, Miguel. I'm Rebecca.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.467
I'm a widow who can't seem

11:57.550 --> 11:59.219
to stop talking
about her husband's death.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.223
-(bell dings)
-Oh, um,

12:03.306 --> 12:05.975
if this next one's a dud,
can we just get out of here?

12:06.059 --> 12:07.977
-Deal. (chuckles)
-Great.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.688
See you soon.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.490
-REBECCA: Hi.
-Rebecca.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.700
Matt Dickson,

12:21.783 --> 12:24.119
from the PTA.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.912
It's nice to see you again.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.539
It's good to see you, too.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.582
How are you?

12:29.666 --> 12:30.792
(laughs)

12:30.875 --> 12:32.752
Okay, so, today is officially

12:32.836 --> 12:35.422
-take most of your family
to work day.
-(laughs)

12:35.505 --> 12:37.424
I brought Jack

12:37.507 --> 12:41.136
-and Hailey and my mom, Rebecca.
-Hi.

12:41.219 --> 12:44.806
Yeah, and she's actually
a really great piano player.

12:44.889 --> 12:47.600
-I'm okay. (chuckles)
-KATE: No, she's really great.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.186
So, I figured, for our
jam session today, we could have

12:50.270 --> 12:53.023
a guest musician.
What do you think, Mom?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.486
Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill you.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.363
When are you gonna tell them?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.115
We're thinking
right before dessert.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.491
Malik's making blueberry pie.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.659
Smart.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.910
You got to butter
them up beforehand.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.037
Stroke their egos a little bit.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.581
Ask about Dad's addiction
initiative thing.

13:09.664 --> 13:10.749
He loves talking about that.

13:10.832 --> 13:13.126
Annie, you still got
knock-knock jokes?

13:13.209 --> 13:15.295
I feel like I've aged out
of knock-knock jokes.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.840
Well, if I need help,
I'll give you the signal, okay?

13:18.923 --> 13:20.925
(footsteps approaching)

13:23.845 --> 13:25.388
What are you ladies
conferencing about?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.432
-Algebra.
-Knock-knock jokes.
-Nothing.

13:27.515 --> 13:29.601
Oh, I miss your
knock-knock jokes, Annie.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.187
-(phone rings)
-Hey, brother of mine.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.189
(front door opens, closes)

13:34.272 --> 13:36.524
<i>KEVIN:</i>
<i>Hey, so I'm in a car</i>
<i>headed to the mom house.</i>

13:36.608 --> 13:38.401
<i>Uncle Nicky's there</i>
<i>on the ground floor,</i>

13:38.485 --> 13:40.320
and Cassidy's coming
this weekend, so...

13:40.403 --> 13:41.529
<i>RANDALL:</i>
<i>Whoa, war vet Cassidy?</i>

13:41.613 --> 13:42.655
Like, Nicky threw
a chair at her,

13:42.739 --> 13:43.823
and then you slept with her?

13:43.907 --> 13:45.450
Well, I mean,
that's a bit reductive,

13:45.533 --> 13:46.826
but... yeah, her.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.620
<i>Oh, man, I did not</i>
<i>see that one coming.</i>

13:48.703 --> 13:51.206
Huh. Coming down
the home stretch,

13:51.289 --> 13:52.415
seemingly out of nowhere,

13:52.499 --> 13:53.833
beating out
all the local favorites,

13:53.917 --> 13:55.502
<i>passing Sophie, passing Madison,</i>

13:55.585 --> 13:57.671
passing Zoe,
my African-American cousin.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.714
Can she do it? Yes!

13:59.798 --> 14:02.717
It's Cassidy
by a hundredth of a second.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.260
<i>It's not like that at all.</i>

14:04.344 --> 14:06.137
Believe it or not,
there are people out there

14:06.221 --> 14:07.639
that are capable of having

14:07.722 --> 14:10.225
casual, consensual, you know,

14:10.308 --> 14:12.143
"we're both hot,
so let's just do it" sex.

14:12.227 --> 14:15.188
And you, my brother,
are not one of them.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.524
You try to have
a one-night stand,

14:17.607 --> 14:19.734
and you wind up with twins.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.195
You are the world's strangest

14:22.278 --> 14:24.030
serial monogamist.

14:24.114 --> 14:26.032
Okay, well, I'm here, so, um,

14:26.116 --> 14:28.243
thank you for the most
useless conversation ever.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.704
Yeah, man. You have fun
at your couples retreat,

14:30.787 --> 14:32.330
and do me a favor.

14:32.414 --> 14:34.165
Try not to propose, okay?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.542
You know how you get.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.335
Thank you, Randall. (chuckles)

14:37.419 --> 14:39.295
(phone beeps)

14:39.379 --> 14:41.214
NICKY:
Hey!

14:41.297 --> 14:43.341
♪ ♪

14:43.383 --> 14:44.384
Good to see you.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.515
EDIE:
Married three times,
but they never stuck.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.892
You know, I wasn't
that great at it

14:52.976 --> 14:54.519
because I was always
traveling for work.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.271
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.648
But I do have two
beautiful children that made

14:58.732 --> 15:01.151
-the divorces,
you know, worth it.
-Hmm.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.902
She has three marriages,
and I have none,

15:02.986 --> 15:04.320
so, I think between
the two of us,

15:04.404 --> 15:07.240
-we almost make a normal person.
-EDIE (laughs): Yes.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.576
So, what do you think?

15:09.659 --> 15:11.369
Ah, I think she seems

15:11.453 --> 15:12.579
surprisingly lovely.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.040
I mean...

15:15.123 --> 15:16.583
Sometimes I worry, you know.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.960
I mean, she's been
a flight attendant, you know.

15:19.044 --> 15:20.879
She's... you know,

15:20.962 --> 15:22.505
been around all sorts of guys.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.675
-Oh, well...
-I just, you know,
sometimes I worry

15:25.759 --> 15:28.136
that maybe I'm just a port
in her storm, you know.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.596
Oh, here's a curveball,

15:29.679 --> 15:32.223
she brought an overnight bag
for tonight.

15:32.307 --> 15:33.892
-Brought an overnight bag?
-Mm-hmm.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.393
Wow. (chuckles)

15:35.477 --> 15:36.686
-We're going there?
-Oh, yeah.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.064
Ah, I mean, have you guys
consummated yet, or...?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.066
-Would you keep your voice down?
-I'm sorry.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.108
-No.
-You know, she's not listening

15:42.192 --> 15:43.193
-to what we're saying.
-Shh!

15:43.276 --> 15:44.652
-Shh!
-Sorry.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.030
No, we have not.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.407
It's been more than a little
time since I've, you know,

15:49.491 --> 15:51.368
made love to a real, live woman.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.870
A real, live woman?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.206
What do you mean by that?
That's just... Listen.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.583
Just do it. Just do it.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.168
-Right.
-I'm sure you'll remember,
you know.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.379
-It's not that complicated.
-Right.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.255
Oh, so, what about, uh...

16:04.339 --> 16:05.715
you and Cassidy, uh,

16:05.799 --> 16:07.342
you guys gonna
sleep together this weekend?

16:07.425 --> 16:09.052
(exhales) It's complicated.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.805
Oh, yeah.

16:11.888 --> 16:14.057
Oh, that salad looks great.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.810
-Yeah, not bad, right?
-So, you guys met on the plane?

16:16.893 --> 16:18.061
Yes.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.022
He was belligerent
and very, very disruptive.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.109
And she was unhelpful
and unfriendly.

16:24.192 --> 16:25.652
-Hmm.
-(chuckles)

16:25.735 --> 16:27.696
Got to love that initial first
spark, you know what I mean?

16:27.779 --> 16:30.073
-Yeah.
-I always say my Uncle Nicky's
an acquired taste.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.074
EDIE:
Tell me about it.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.450
Hey, tell-tell Kevin

16:32.534 --> 16:33.952
what you think of <i>The Manny.</i>

16:34.035 --> 16:36.079
-Nicky. Nick--
No, that's terrible.
-Go on, tell him.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.248
-She hates it.
-Oh, my God.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.875
-She hates it. She thinks
it's really dumb.
-I...

16:40.959 --> 16:43.044
-So rude. Would you stop...
-(laughs)

16:43.128 --> 16:44.379
...eating my chicken.

16:44.462 --> 16:48.008
Can my Uncle Nicky
be a closet lady killer?

16:48.091 --> 16:49.634
They're very cute.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.261
-Can you pass the salad?
-Yeah.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.596
(indistinct whispering)

16:53.680 --> 16:55.640
-Thank you.
-New love.

16:55.724 --> 16:57.559
It's quite nice.

16:57.642 --> 16:59.060
Yeah.

17:05.442 --> 17:06.985
Oh, gosh. Okay, so that's
Randall, that's Kate...

17:07.068 --> 17:09.654
Oh, um, and my son, Kevin,

17:09.738 --> 17:12.741
is in Los Angeles
trying to be an actor.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.908
-An actor?
-Mm-hmm.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.494
Wow, and how do you
feel about that?

17:16.578 --> 17:19.664
It seems impossible
to me, but, um...

17:19.748 --> 17:21.541
part of me is just proud that he

17:21.624 --> 17:22.751
has the guts to do it,

17:22.834 --> 17:24.753
-you know?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.713
I wanted to be a detective.

17:26.796 --> 17:29.883
-Really?
-Yeah. That was always
my big dream.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.926
Well, you-you could
still be a detective.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.470
-You think so?
-Yeah.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.222
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but I am really good at guessing

17:36.306 --> 17:38.224
-who did it on <i>Law &amp; Order.</i>
-(chuckles)

17:38.308 --> 17:40.894
See, I never know who did it.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.605
I always just assume
it's the first person.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.065
No, you--
That's your first problem.

17:45.148 --> 17:46.232
It's never the first person,

17:46.316 --> 17:47.609
and also, it's never the person

17:47.692 --> 17:48.902
that works at the pizzeria.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.195
Ah.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.738
I am learning so much right now.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.865
-(Matt and Rebecca laugh)
-(bell dings)

17:53.948 --> 17:55.909
MATT:
Ah...

17:55.992 --> 17:58.161
-I-I have to...
-This was really fun.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.788
It was nice to catch up
with you, Matt.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.706
-This was nice.
-Yeah.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.589
Hi. I'm Ren. I like your vibe.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.467
-Hi. I'm...
-MATT: Rebecca?

18:12.550 --> 18:14.761
I'm-I'm so sorry
to interrupt. Uh...

18:14.844 --> 18:17.180
I don't know if the, you know,
speed dating police

18:17.263 --> 18:19.599
are gonna arrest me
for speeding or something,

18:19.683 --> 18:22.310
but I was wondering...

18:22.394 --> 18:24.688
do you want
to get coffee with me

18:24.771 --> 18:26.314
-after this?
-Um...

18:26.398 --> 18:28.608
Yeah.

18:28.692 --> 18:30.527
I'd love that.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.946
-Me, too.
-REBECCA: Okay. (laughs)

18:34.614 --> 18:36.866
(chuckles)

18:36.950 --> 18:39.619
I have a ferret.

18:39.703 --> 18:41.871
Oh...

18:41.955 --> 18:43.331
<i>WOMAN (on TV):</i>
<i>Seriously?</i>

18:43.415 --> 18:45.125
<i>-It's like you're Photoshopped.</i>
-(laughing)

18:45.208 --> 18:46.835
(groans)

18:46.918 --> 18:49.379
You know what?
Makes me nervous just to imagine

18:49.462 --> 18:51.423
what might be going on
under that blanket.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.883
(chuckles)
I'm proud of the old man.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.886
Listen, um...

18:56.970 --> 18:59.305
Would you want to help

18:59.389 --> 19:01.808
Nicky oversee
the construction here

19:01.891 --> 19:04.269
on the days you
don't have Matty? I mean,

19:04.352 --> 19:06.563
-I could pay you for it.
-I don't need your charity.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.982
It's not a charity thing.
It's a...

19:09.065 --> 19:10.859
It's a "the contractor
told me that Uncle Nicky

19:10.942 --> 19:12.610
-threw a stapler at him" thing.
-(laughs)

19:12.694 --> 19:14.070
And since you,

19:14.154 --> 19:17.115
since you managed classified
operations in Afghanistan,

19:17.198 --> 19:20.577
I figure maybe you could handle
a contractor and my uncle.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.370
I'll think about it.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.789
You'll think about it?
Very good. Well, you think away.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.291
Thinking. Still thinking.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.792
(laughs)

19:30.962 --> 19:32.380
Thank you.

19:35.342 --> 19:36.259
What?

19:36.343 --> 19:38.094
Nothing.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.600
Hey, do you want to go get
ice cream or something?

19:45.060 --> 19:46.770
-Yeah, sure. Yeah.
-Yeah?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.563
Let's go.

19:51.149 --> 19:52.525
(sighs)

19:54.110 --> 19:55.737
(water continues pouring)

19:56.946 --> 19:58.990
MALIK:
There you go.

19:59.074 --> 20:00.825
BETH:
Gnocchi looks...

20:00.909 --> 20:03.286
excellent, Malik.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.121
Thank you. Everybody,

20:05.205 --> 20:07.040
please, dig in.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.090
(Beth clears throat)

20:15.173 --> 20:17.342
MALIK:
Um...

20:17.425 --> 20:20.553
We had wanted to apologize

20:20.637 --> 20:22.972
for the weekend
that Deja came to Boston.

20:23.056 --> 20:26.643
We should've handled that
differently for sure.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.521
I know that you guys have
already spoken with Deja, but...

20:29.604 --> 20:31.481
I wanted to get a chance
to look you both in the eyes

20:31.564 --> 20:34.567
and apologize myself as well.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.361
It was definitely
a mutual decision.

20:41.116 --> 20:43.451
Thank you for
saying that, Malik.

20:43.535 --> 20:44.703
And may I just say

20:44.786 --> 20:47.580
that, um... this is

20:47.664 --> 20:49.749
the best butter sauce
I've ever tasted, so...

20:49.833 --> 20:52.168
Thank you. Brown butter.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.756
Um, Mom, how's it going
at the dance studio?

20:56.840 --> 20:59.092
-I'd love to hear about it.
-What?
-That's very nice, Tess.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.970
It's unusually nice, Tess.
Yeah, work is fine.

21:02.053 --> 21:05.348
Busy, finding my way, but...

21:05.432 --> 21:08.727
You know... it's good.
Thanks for asking,

21:08.810 --> 21:10.437
for the very first time ever.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.400
Does anyone want to hear
a knock-knock joke?

21:15.483 --> 21:17.902
-Okay, what's going on?
-RANDALL: Hmm...

21:17.986 --> 21:19.320
-DEJA: What? What?
-MALIK: What?

21:19.404 --> 21:20.697
You two are making eyes
at each other,

21:20.780 --> 21:22.449
and not the normal
lovey-dovey eyes,

21:22.532 --> 21:24.284
okay, it's the
"we're up to something" eyes.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.829
And Tess is showing unusual
interest in things she is

21:27.912 --> 21:29.831
off-the-charts uninterested in,
and I ain't heard

21:29.914 --> 21:31.416
a knock-knock joke in this house
for a clean seven years,

21:31.499 --> 21:33.835
so what's going--
You're tugging your ear.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.587
-Why's she tugging her ear?
What's tugging that ear?
-RANDALL: What's she doing?

21:35.670 --> 21:37.213
-I'm getting a C in Algebra.
-RANDALL: What?

21:37.297 --> 21:38.465
But you've been working
with a tutor. What the...

21:38.548 --> 21:40.300
It's a tactic. It's all tactics.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.594
-They're tactics. Spill it.
-Yeah, you right.

21:42.677 --> 21:44.387
Now.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.975
I'm finishing out
this school semester next month,

21:49.059 --> 21:50.852
and I'm moving to Boston
with Malik.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.694
Knock, knock!

22:11.873 --> 22:13.333
(engine turns off)

22:14.584 --> 22:17.212
-Thank you for the coffee.
-Oh, you're welcome.

22:17.295 --> 22:18.838
And I would've sprung
for the muffin.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.507
Oh, the muffin
would've been moving

22:20.590 --> 22:23.093
-a little too fast
for me, but...
-(chuckles)

22:23.176 --> 22:25.470
I had a lot of fun.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.472
-Me, too.
-Mm.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.307
A-And next time we go out,

22:29.391 --> 22:31.476
I promise I won't make you date
seven guys beforehand.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.727
(both laughing)

22:32.811 --> 22:34.229
Deal.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.778
I'll call you.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.571
I'd like that.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.913

No. I'm actually walking back

23:34.539 --> 23:37.876
it was not a canoe. Legit yacht.

23:37.959 --> 23:40.420
<i>-Everything okay?</i>
-Yeah.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.715
No.

23:43.798 --> 23:46.217
We're at the school
with my mom, and she's...

23:46.301 --> 23:47.677
so happy.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.721
W-We're happy.

23:49.804 --> 23:52.307
Finally in a good place and...

23:52.390 --> 23:54.601
(sighs) It just took
a long time to get here, Tobe.

23:54.684 --> 23:57.645
How many bumps in the road?
Like 30 years of bumps.

23:57.729 --> 23:59.856
We just lost so much time.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.649
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.319
You still have time.

24:04.402 --> 24:07.864
Kate, you-you still have
a lot of time.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.076
-(applause)
-REBECCA: Nice. Sounds so good.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.287
But, Tobe, I've got to
tell her tonight.

24:14.371 --> 24:16.206
<i>(sighs) I'm sorry.</i>

24:16.289 --> 24:18.333
I love you so much.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.168
Love you.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.379
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

24:22.462 --> 24:23.838
Bye.

24:23.922 --> 24:26.216
(Rebecca playing piano)

24:33.390 --> 24:35.809
You're joking, right?

24:35.892 --> 24:39.145
I took on three extra
A.P. classes

24:39.229 --> 24:40.689
this semester,

24:40.772 --> 24:42.649
so, technically, that gives me

24:42.732 --> 24:45.318
enough credits to graduate.

24:45.402 --> 24:48.238
And I can take the G.E.D.
in December,

24:48.321 --> 24:50.782
-with your permission.
-Permission not granted.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.742
-Take a breath, babe.
-Uh...

24:52.826 --> 24:54.035
You two, go upstairs, please.

25:03.420 --> 25:06.464
Harvard does offer classes
for current high school students

25:06.548 --> 25:08.800
and students that are looking
to take a year off.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.136
It would essentially be
like a gap year,

25:11.219 --> 25:12.762
and then I'd apply
to college in the fall.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.180
Enough.
You don't have to show us

25:14.264 --> 25:15.682
the whole
PowerPoint presentation.

25:15.765 --> 25:17.350
BETH:
You know what, Deja,
you're 17 years old.

25:17.434 --> 25:19.060
You're a junior in high school.

25:19.144 --> 25:20.520
You're not dropping out
to move in

25:20.603 --> 25:22.063
with your boyfriend
in another state.

25:22.147 --> 25:24.941
It wouldn't be dropping out.
It would be graduating early.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.151
MALIK:
I promise, we would be doing

25:26.234 --> 25:27.527
a lot of studying.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.404
I-I mean, we hold each other
accountable.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.865
-We encourage each other.
-(laughs) I bet you do.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.492
-That's rude.
-I'm rude?

25:34.576 --> 25:36.036
I'm sorry,
this whole thing is rude.

25:36.119 --> 25:37.579
Y'all are rude.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.457
You are not old enough
to make this kind of decision.

25:40.540 --> 25:43.293
-Oh, now I'm not old enough?
-RANDALL: What are you
talking about, man?

25:44.794 --> 25:48.214
All those times you told me
I'm "wise beyond my years"?

25:48.298 --> 25:51.092
(chuckles)
It's because I am, Randall.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.386
I've lived a lot

25:53.470 --> 25:57.223
more life in my 17 years

25:57.307 --> 26:00.018
than a lot of people
twice my age,

26:00.101 --> 26:03.688
and you,
out of anyone in this world,

26:03.772 --> 26:05.273
knows that best.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.657
(chair scrapes)

26:14.741 --> 26:15.867
-Randall.
-Hmm?

26:15.950 --> 26:17.660
Can you take a breath
and have a conversation?

26:17.744 --> 26:20.789
-Can we do that?
-No, we can't, Beth.

26:20.872 --> 26:23.458
'Cause I have nothing
to say about any of this.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.420
(footsteps departing)

26:39.432 --> 26:40.975
Hi.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.394
I thought you were at Molly's.

26:42.477 --> 26:47.065
Aunt Molly was tired.
Whose car was that?

26:47.148 --> 26:50.944
Uh, believe it or not,

26:51.027 --> 26:53.029
I was on a date.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.532
You went on a date?

26:55.615 --> 26:57.450
Well, eh, kind of.
(chuckles)

26:57.534 --> 27:01.204
Miguel and I went and did this
silly speed dating thing,

27:01.287 --> 27:03.289
and I ended up
running into a man

27:03.373 --> 27:04.624
that I actually knew there,

27:04.708 --> 27:06.418
and we went and had some coffee.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.337
You went and got coffee
until, like, 10:00?

27:09.421 --> 27:11.715
You were the one telling me
to get a life.

27:11.798 --> 27:14.551
No, no, I told you to stop
watching that stupid show

27:14.634 --> 27:16.011
with stupid Miguel.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.805
So, what, what, you're,
like, dating now?

27:18.888 --> 27:21.599
Uh, I don't know.

27:21.683 --> 27:25.895
Look, Kate, I know it's weird,

27:25.979 --> 27:28.690
but I have to start to
try to move on.

27:28.773 --> 27:33.737
Oh, right. Move on from Dad,
because he's dead. I'm aware.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.613
I'm sorry.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.240
I'm sorry, yeah. I, I'm--

27:37.323 --> 27:38.908
I should have been a little bit
more sensitive with you

27:38.992 --> 27:41.369
when I brought it up,
but I really believe

27:41.453 --> 27:42.620
that I deserve happiness.

27:42.704 --> 27:44.372
I think it's what
your father would want.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.166
In fact, I know it's what
your father would want.

27:46.249 --> 27:48.835
Oh, by making out with some
random dude you just met?

27:48.918 --> 27:50.670
Okay, you know what?

27:50.754 --> 27:53.798
You are on some thin ice
with me right now, young lady.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.593
That is not what happened, and
maybe one day you'll understand.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.679
No, Mom. No, I won't.
And neither would Dad.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.766
And he wouldn't be happy for you

28:26.081 --> 28:27.791
-Mom.
-Hmm?

28:27.874 --> 28:29.709
Thank you so much for
all of your help today.

28:29.793 --> 28:31.753
Oh, my pleasure.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.630
I had a blast.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.549
And I learned who Doja Cat is.

28:36.633 --> 28:38.885
Not a cat, but a rapper.

28:38.968 --> 28:40.762
(chuckles)

28:40.845 --> 28:42.472
When does Toby get in?

28:42.555 --> 28:45.058
Ah, in an hour.

28:45.141 --> 28:47.435
You know, you both have been
working so hard.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.020

have a date night,

28:49.104 --> 28:51.356

go out for the afternoon,

28:51.439 --> 28:55.068
I am so happy to come over
and watch the kids for you.

28:57.070 --> 28:59.948
Actually, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:00.031 --> 29:02.909
Toby and I talked, and...

29:02.992 --> 29:04.953
What? What's wrong?

29:05.036 --> 29:07.414
Well, given your last PET scan,

29:07.497 --> 29:11.042
we just don't feel comfortable
with you taking care

29:11.126 --> 29:12.669
of the kids alone anymore.

29:12.752 --> 29:16.423
We know that you would never
do anything intentionally.

29:16.506 --> 29:18.049
It's just without
another adult around,

29:18.133 --> 29:20.385
we just can't--
Mom, I'm really sorry.

29:20.468 --> 29:23.680
Oh, so that's why you wanted me
to go to school with you today

29:23.763 --> 29:26.808
instead of watching
the kids here.

29:26.891 --> 29:28.893
Not 'cause you actually
wanted me to go with you.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.771
No, I did want you to come.

29:31.855 --> 29:34.190
Okay, um...

29:34.274 --> 29:36.401
I think I'm gonna go home, Kate.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.005

29:59.758 --> 30:02.510
Apologies for walking out.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.971
Didn't expect that conversation.

30:07.265 --> 30:09.893
(scoffs)
I get it.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.232
You know, you and I have spent
a lot of time together, Malik.

30:17.734 --> 30:21.488
And, uh, I feel like

30:21.571 --> 30:24.866
I've tried to impart
some wisdom to you.

30:24.949 --> 30:26.659
No, you-you've been great to me.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.870
And you're on a path, man.

30:28.953 --> 30:32.290
You are on a great path.

30:37.087 --> 30:41.091
Deja needs to find
her own path now, Malik.

30:41.174 --> 30:44.969
She's got two big years
ahead of her.

30:45.053 --> 30:49.474
Two years that could determine
the rest of her life.

30:52.394 --> 30:54.938
You need to end it, Malik.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.564
-You need to do it for her.
-What?

30:56.648 --> 30:59.067
I'm not gonna...
I love her.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.777
If you really love her, man,
then you will do

31:00.860 --> 31:02.696
what is best for her.

31:02.779 --> 31:06.449
But leaving school,
leaving her home...

31:06.533 --> 31:08.118
Moving six hours away.

31:08.201 --> 31:11.913
Moving in with an 18-year-old
and his daughter.

31:11.996 --> 31:15.291
That is not what's best
for her, man.

31:15.375 --> 31:18.753
You are a very smart young man.
You know that.

31:28.346 --> 31:30.140
I'm gonna go ahead
and not tell Deja

31:30.223 --> 31:33.351
about this conversation.

31:33.435 --> 31:36.771
Because I really do love her.

31:36.855 --> 31:40.734
And I care about you all's
relationship.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.862
And I can promise you she would
not feel good about this.

31:50.493 --> 31:53.580
I'm just saying,
Bubble Gum is...

31:53.663 --> 31:55.373
I've just never seen anyone
over the age of nine

31:55.457 --> 31:56.541
order that before.

31:56.624 --> 31:58.126
It's the universal worst
flavor of ice cream.

31:58.209 --> 32:01.755
Well, maybe I like an underdog.

32:05.884 --> 32:07.552
What are you doing?

32:07.635 --> 32:11.514
I'm sorry, I thought we said
that was on the table.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.058
I said I might want
to have sex with you.

32:13.141 --> 32:14.434
I didn't say I wanted
to hold your hand.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.436
O-Okay.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.939
Wait, hold-- Why?

32:20.023 --> 32:23.860
Yes, we did, we came together
in a time of loneliness

32:23.943 --> 32:25.820
and-and addiction.

32:25.904 --> 32:27.989
But what if...

32:28.073 --> 32:31.201
What if that inner darkness
actually turned out to be

32:31.284 --> 32:32.994
something kind of wonderful?

32:33.078 --> 32:36.748
You've watched too many
rom-coms, Kevin.

32:36.831 --> 32:39.334
I think you're scared.

32:39.417 --> 32:40.710
I...
(inhales sharply)

32:43.296 --> 32:48.718
There's no reality to
a relationship working with us.

32:48.802 --> 32:52.555
Your kids are in L.A.
My kid is in Pennsylvania.

32:52.639 --> 32:53.932
I know that, but look,
you and I obviously

32:54.015 --> 32:54.933
have a connection.

32:55.016 --> 32:57.435
It's a false equivalency, Kevin.

32:59.562 --> 33:03.900
Your inner darkness...
(clears throat)

33:03.983 --> 33:05.694
is not the same as mine.

33:05.777 --> 33:07.987
Have you noticed that when
you text at 3:00 in the morning,

33:08.071 --> 33:09.531
I'm always awake?

33:11.700 --> 33:16.746
Our darknesses are not the same.

33:18.623 --> 33:23.878
You are chasing the wrong blonde
in the wrong city.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.588
And if you want

33:25.672 --> 33:29.509
that rom-com love story,

33:29.592 --> 33:31.845
you should go make things
right with her.

33:33.847 --> 33:35.640
I'm not even sure I know which
blonde you're talking about,

33:35.724 --> 33:36.766
to be honest with you.

33:36.850 --> 33:39.477
You see how that's a problem?

33:39.561 --> 33:41.604
-Yeah.
-Aw, Kevin,

33:41.688 --> 33:43.064
you've been blowing up
women's lives

33:43.148 --> 33:45.442
for the better part of
two decades.

33:45.525 --> 33:46.526
-I know you mean-- Oh, come on.
-Ah!

33:46.609 --> 33:48.361
I know you mean well, I do.

33:48.445 --> 33:52.532
But, you know, you are, like,
a big handsome wrecking ball.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.117
I'm not blowing
people's lives up, no.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.369
Okay. All right,
you married one,

33:56.453 --> 33:57.954
and then cheated,

33:58.038 --> 34:00.123
and then nearly married her
again.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.542
The current one,
you couldn't say "I love you,"

34:02.625 --> 34:06.171
but now you're obsessed with
hating the new boyfriend.

34:06.254 --> 34:09.174
Be careful, or you're gonna
blow that up, too.

34:12.093 --> 34:15.930

take a step back.
