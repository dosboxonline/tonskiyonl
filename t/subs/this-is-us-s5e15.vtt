-NICKY: Oh, wow.

10:50.442 --> 10:51.526
-Let's get inside. Come on.
-Okay, okay.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.111
(Randall clears throat)

10:53.194 --> 10:56.656
Kate, I told you I just wanted
a chill girl's day,

10:56.740 --> 10:58.700
and this is already feeling very
<i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>

10:58.783 --> 11:01.619
Okay, okay, one sec.
All right, all right.

11:01.703 --> 11:05.415
-(singsongy): You can take it off.
-Okay.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.792
ALL:
Happy bachelorette!

11:07.876 --> 11:10.128
Oh, guys, thank you.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.672
This is beautiful.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.300
Well, only the best
for my future sister-in-law.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.594
Aw. Hi.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.929
Hi, sweetheart.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.056
-Beth!
-Oh!

11:21.139 --> 11:22.932
-Thank you for coming early.
-Oh.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.517
Where are the girls?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.394
Oh, they're back at the hotel watching

11:26.478 --> 11:28.772
<i>-To All the Boys I've Loved Before,</i>
Part 9.
-Oh.

11:28.855 --> 11:32.150
Besides, I heard that this was
a strictly 21 and over event,

11:32.233 --> 11:34.110
-you know, which I am here for.
-Oh.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.697
Wait. Why is this a strictly 21
and over event? Hmm?

11:37.781 --> 11:39.991
-KATE: Uh, well...
-(doorbell rings)

11:40.075 --> 11:42.452
-Oh. Who could that be?
-MADISON: Kate.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.829
-No. We talked about this.
-Listen, okay, just relax, okay?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.373
I'm not gonna do anything
that's gonna land us

11:46.456 --> 11:48.458
in, like, family therapy.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.834
(whispering):
Just take us right to the cusp.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.337
-(soft laughter)
-Hi. Come in.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.381
Uh, oh, wait.
Just to make sure... you're...

11:54.464 --> 11:57.050
-Vaxxed and waxed for your pleasure.
-Sure.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.968
Okay.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.387
Well, come on in.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.888
Madison?

12:01.971 --> 12:04.182
Joe.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.725
What's happening?

12:05.809 --> 12:07.644
If I was a betting woman, I'd say

12:07.727 --> 12:09.979
our girl Madison has a little history
with the stripper.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.315
He's not a stripper.
He's a model, right?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.401
And he's from a place called
Picasso and Prosecco.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.319
So he's gonna make us drinks and then

12:16.403 --> 12:17.779
takes off his clothes off,
and then we get to paint him.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.948
I'm sorry.
How do you two know each other?

12:20.031 --> 12:22.367
-We dated.
-Oh.

12:22.450 --> 12:26.413
Really good to see you,
and, um, congratulations.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.039
Thanks.
(laughs)

12:28.123 --> 12:30.500
So, uh, where should we set up?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.878
And did you want to paint me
in boxer briefs or full nude?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.797
The latter.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.470
(rain falling)

12:43.471 --> 12:44.723
This is why you should always
bring a puzzle.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.641
I-I got to go check on Rebecca.

12:46.725 --> 12:48.435
She hasn't texted back in a while.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.438
Miguel, she's with Kate and Beth.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.856
I'm sure she's fine.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.191
-You guys decide on a movie yet?
-RANDALL: Um...

12:57.277 --> 12:59.487
Hey, Kev, what about <i>Jerry Maguire?</i>

12:59.571 --> 13:01.948
You used to love this one.

13:02.032 --> 13:04.159
<i>YOUNG KEVIN:</i>
Jerry Maguire?

13:04.242 --> 13:06.953
I love this movie, man.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.955
I saw it with Dad when it first came out.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.957
Uh, shouldn't you go check on Sophie?

13:11.041 --> 13:14.669
She should for sure
just blow off some steam.

13:14.753 --> 13:17.756
Yeah. Yeah, I could go for
a little Cameron Crowe right now.

13:17.839 --> 13:19.549
Let's do it.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.053
I'll get some snacks.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.643
<i>Can I help you?</i>

13:30.727 --> 13:32.854
<i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

13:32.937 --> 13:37.192
<i>I work in your office.</i>
<i>I was on a junket.</i>

13:37.275 --> 13:39.069
<i>JERRY:</i>
<i>I began writing</i>

13:39.152 --> 13:41.154
<i>what they call a "mission statement."</i>

13:41.237 --> 13:43.239
<i>Not a memo, a mission statement.</i>

13:43.323 --> 13:46.284
<i>A night like this</i>
<i>doesn't come along very often.</i>

13:46.368 --> 13:48.328
<i>I seized it.</i>

13:48.411 --> 13:52.248
<i>Suddenly, I was my father's son again.</i>

13:52.332 --> 13:55.960
<i>I was remembering</i>
<i>the simple pleasures of this job.</i>

13:56.044 --> 13:59.422
<i>...neural pathways are set,</i>
<i>and that's why</i>

13:59.506 --> 14:00.924
<i>it's hard for people to change.</i>

14:01.007 --> 14:02.926
<i>That's why behavior</i>
<i>doesn't change very often.</i>

14:03.009 --> 14:07.806
<i>We live in a cynical world.</i>
<i>A cynical world.</i>

14:07.889 --> 14:10.475
<i>And we work in a business</i>

14:10.558 --> 14:12.686
<i>of tough competitors.</i>

14:16.773 --> 14:20.944
Wow, Mr. Pearson
was ridiculously handsome.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.405
Even with the mustache.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.824
(laughing): Yep, he was.

14:25.907 --> 14:29.411
Hey, congratulations, by the way,

14:29.494 --> 14:31.746
on the internship in Boston.

14:31.830 --> 14:33.915
It sounds very exciting.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.709
Thanks.

14:35.792 --> 14:38.169
Yeah, I'm-I'm still pretty 50-50 on it.

14:38.253 --> 14:40.714
I know it's none of my business,

14:40.797 --> 14:43.591
but I think you and Randall
are strong enough

14:43.675 --> 14:45.343
to handle being apart for a few months.

14:45.427 --> 14:49.014
If this is something
you're passionate about doing.

14:49.097 --> 14:50.849
I know.

14:50.932 --> 14:54.644
I'm actually not worried
about me and Randall.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.731
It's this amazing urban planning firm.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.191
They focus on creating these public spaces

15:00.275 --> 15:01.901
for underserved communities.

15:01.985 --> 15:05.321
That sounds like
a special thing to be a part of.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.408
Yeah, it would be, um,

15:08.491 --> 15:10.118
but it's also really intense.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.245
Like, they give their interns
their own projects

15:12.328 --> 15:14.873
to work on and manage and...

15:14.956 --> 15:16.875
I just...

15:16.958 --> 15:20.962
I'm just not sure how much more failure
I can take, you know?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.009
Did Randall tell you that I used to dance?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.178
He did.

15:30.305 --> 15:33.099
Did he tell you that I used to sing?

15:33.183 --> 15:35.894
Hmm.
He did.

15:35.977 --> 15:38.021
So I know the feeling

15:38.104 --> 15:41.358
of having a dream cut off at the knees.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.027
But you... are too young

15:44.110 --> 15:45.737
and too smart and too strong

15:45.820 --> 15:47.989
to not find new dreams and go for them.

15:48.073 --> 15:52.202
And I suspect when you do,
you will blow everyone away.

15:59.584 --> 16:02.379
Ugh.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.756
I can't get the right color
for his nipples.

16:04.839 --> 16:07.842
Hmm.
Why don't you try a little orange?

16:07.926 --> 16:10.595
Oh.

16:10.679 --> 16:12.180
Madison, is this too weird?

16:12.263 --> 16:13.848
'Cause I can send him home.
Like, I have plenty

16:13.932 --> 16:15.266
of other activities that we can do.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.602
No, it's fine.
Honestly, I decided

16:17.686 --> 16:20.689
the best revenge
against a guy that ghosted me

16:20.772 --> 16:23.316
is painting him naked days before

16:23.400 --> 16:25.026
I marry one of <i>People's</i> Most Beautiful.

16:25.110 --> 16:26.945
-You're damn right it is.
-REBECCA: Wait.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.363
What-what does "ghosted" mean?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.323
It's when you go out with someone,

16:30.407 --> 16:31.908
and then they end things

16:31.991 --> 16:33.743
by not returning your calls or your texts.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.788
Just disappearing, like a ghost.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.206
What?

16:38.289 --> 16:39.749
That's horrible.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.543
-Mm-hmm.
-You are horrible, Joe.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.378
-I know.
-KATE: Well,

16:43.461 --> 16:45.422
at least you never have to deal
with that crap again.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.090
MADISON:
Here's to

16:47.173 --> 16:50.010
-never dating again.
-BETH: Mm.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.178
-Cheers.
-KATE: And to Kevin

16:52.262 --> 16:54.222
knowing a great thing when he saw it.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.306
That part.

16:55.390 --> 16:56.725
(laughs softly)

16:56.808 --> 16:58.768
I mean, sure.
Kind of.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.729
Hmm?
What do you mean?

17:00.812 --> 17:03.064
I mean, you know, he didn't exactly

17:03.148 --> 17:05.191
jump at the chance to be with me.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.985
It took an accidental pregnancy.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.029
KATE:
Come on. He would have figured it out

17:09.112 --> 17:10.822
-without that.
-Maybe.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.867
But I certainly wasn't
reeling him in with the cute,

17:13.950 --> 17:16.536
bantery texts I sent
after we slept together.

17:18.163 --> 17:21.875
Wait.
So, was Kevin being a ghost to you?

17:21.958 --> 17:25.879
Not totally.
I mean, he'd always answer me.

17:25.962 --> 17:28.715
He was totally polite.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.427
It's fine, you guys, really.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.056
The night we got together was super weird.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.808
I mean, I understand
why he wasn't in the mindset to, like,

17:38.892 --> 17:41.311
you know, ask me on a date.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.521
Well, you know, I believe
everything happens for a reason.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.274
-KATE: Mm-hmm.
-Thank God for Kevin's

17:46.358 --> 17:48.276
powerful sperm making him see the light.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.695
That's my brother, but cheers?

17:50.779 --> 17:52.447
-Hear! Hear!
-KATE: Oh.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.449
WOMEN:
Cheers.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.867
(laughs)

17:55.950 --> 17:58.870
-Oh, my.
-Slight turn for me, Joe?

17:58.953 --> 17:59.829
REBECCA:
Mm.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.624
Yeah, that's right.
Right there.

18:02.707 --> 18:06.836
<i>DICKY FOX:</i>
<i>I failed as much as I've succeeded,</i>

18:06.920 --> 18:10.382
<i>but I love my wife, I love my life,</i>

18:10.465 --> 18:12.842
<i>and I wish you my kind of success.</i>

18:12.926 --> 18:15.512
Oh, man, still holds up.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.055
I can't believe

18:17.138 --> 18:18.890
they never gave Cuba and Regina
a sequel, though.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.517
I would have watched the hell out of that.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.477
-Hmm.
-Kev, what'd you think?

18:22.560 --> 18:23.895
-Yup.
-Everything you remembered it to be?

18:23.978 --> 18:26.231
I think you're right.
Still holds up.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.025
That's it?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.319
Dude, I remember
when you first watched this movie.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.363
You nearly blew a hole through the roof

18:33.446 --> 18:35.532
you were so excited.
(groans)

18:35.615 --> 18:38.868
You must relate to this movie like crazy.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.162
It's practically the story of your life.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.290
What are you... What's that...
What do you mean?

18:44.374 --> 18:47.168
Well, you know, I mean,
guy falls for the kid, or

18:47.252 --> 18:49.212
in your case, the idea of kids,

18:49.295 --> 18:52.549
more than he falls
for the actual girl, you know?

18:52.632 --> 18:54.592
But he sticks by her
just because he's trying

18:54.676 --> 18:56.011
to do the right thing.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.180
You even look like him.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.434
I mean, you sound like him,
you act like him. It's...

19:02.517 --> 19:04.811
Like who?

19:04.894 --> 19:08.857
Jerry Maguire!
You're like Jerry Maguire 2.0.

19:10.942 --> 19:14.779
Mm.
Yeah, look, U-Uncle Nicky,

19:14.863 --> 19:18.241
I'm not marrying Madison
because I got her pregnant.

19:18.324 --> 19:21.870
I'm... I'm marrying her because
I'm-I'm crazy about her.

19:21.953 --> 19:25.707
Oh.
Well, I'm...

19:25.790 --> 19:27.792
(phone chimes)

19:29.544 --> 19:32.339
Good news.
Rebecca's fine.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.258
She's just painting a naked man
with the rest of the wives.

19:40.555 --> 19:44.434
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I failed as much as I've succeeded,</i>

19:44.517 --> 19:46.186
<i>but I love my wife,</i>

19:46.269 --> 19:48.855
<i>I love my life,</i>

19:48.938 --> 19:52.317
<i>and I wish you my kind of success.</i>

19:54.402 --> 19:56.571
I forgot how amazing that movie is.

19:57.989 --> 19:59.908
Did you guys like it?

19:59.991 --> 20:02.160
Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Regina King
kind of remind me

20:02.243 --> 20:04.245
-of a certain couple I know.
-(laughs) Yeah, I saw that.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.663
(both laugh)

20:05.747 --> 20:07.916
That's it?

20:07.999 --> 20:10.168
I-I mean, what about Jerry?

20:10.251 --> 20:13.546
I mean, like, his whole
character, you know? I mean,

20:13.630 --> 20:15.090
Jerry Maguire is the kind of guy

20:15.173 --> 20:16.716
who decides what he wants,
and he goes for it.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.308
I'll be back soon.

20:28.978 --> 20:32.607
Your brother had, like,
a spiritual experience

20:32.691 --> 20:34.859
-watching <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>
-Yeah. (laughs)

20:34.943 --> 20:37.737
-I've never seen that look in his eyes.
-Whoa.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.281
I've always liked Renée Zellweger.

20:40.365 --> 20:41.991
When I first saw her, I said,

20:42.075 --> 20:44.119
"You know, that's-that's a woman
that's going places.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.247
She's extremely talented, uh,
she has a-a beautiful mouth."

20:47.330 --> 20:51.251
Miguel, that is an extremely
weird thing to say, man.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.546
Tobias?
What's your review?

20:56.798 --> 20:58.925
-Of the movie?
-Yeah.

20:59.009 --> 21:00.510
I liked it.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.846
Hey, are you okay, man?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.848
You've been really quiet tonight.

21:04.931 --> 21:07.392
-Yeah. I...
-Why would you say that to me?

21:07.475 --> 21:10.437
That I'm only marrying Madison just

21:10.520 --> 21:12.939
because I want to do the right thing?
Why would you say that?

21:13.023 --> 21:15.734
Are we still on this?
I-I was just running my mouth.

21:15.817 --> 21:17.360
I w...
Just forget I said anything.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.487
No, I don't want to forget it.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.698
I don't want to forget it
because it's rude, man.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.366
It's rude and it's mean.

21:26.161 --> 21:28.663
And, look, I-I know you've been cooped up

21:28.747 --> 21:30.832
i-in a trailer by yourself
for the past 40 years,

21:30.915 --> 21:33.126
and you have apparently
forgotten how to talk to people,

21:33.209 --> 21:35.795
but that doesn't give you
the right to come into a room

21:35.879 --> 21:37.964
-and just act like a jackass.
-RANDALL: Kev.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.675
Why don't you take a breath?

21:43.762 --> 21:47.265
Yeah.
I'll take a breath.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.059
<i>KATE:</i>
<i>Okay,</i>

21:49.142 --> 21:50.977
-who's ready for the next activity?
-(phone chimes)

21:51.061 --> 21:53.104
I got Kev to play The Newlywed Game.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.189
(gasps)

21:55.690 --> 21:57.275
(Madison laughs)

21:57.359 --> 21:58.985
-No.
-Hey, will you ladies wait for me?

21:59.069 --> 22:01.488
-This sangria's going right through me.
-KATE: Okay.

22:01.571 --> 22:03.490
-MADISON: What did you do?
-KATE: Well, we'll have to wait

22:03.573 --> 22:05.158
-to find out.
-MADISON: This is crazy.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.369
-KATE: It's gonna be so great.
-MADISON: Aah, I'm so nervous.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.954
(footsteps approaching)

22:10.038 --> 22:11.539
REBECCA:
Beth?

22:11.623 --> 22:14.167
Oh. Hey.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.503
What's going on?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.298
I reached out to a job recruiter

22:20.382 --> 22:22.342
just to figure out my next steps,

22:22.425 --> 22:25.553
and she got back to me
with a couple listings

22:25.637 --> 22:30.016
from some very traditional
dance conservatories.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.811
That's a good thing, isn't it?

22:32.894 --> 22:34.104
Could be.

22:34.187 --> 22:36.106
It's just these dance academies

22:36.189 --> 22:39.859
took something I love and made it joyless.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.112
It's a broken system, Rebecca.

22:42.195 --> 22:44.239
I just... I don't want to be a part of it.

22:45.824 --> 22:49.703
-You do know you're the most
impressive person I know?
-Oh.

22:49.786 --> 22:53.373
-Right? No, no, I mean it. I'm serious.
-(chuckles)

22:53.456 --> 22:55.250
The...

22:55.333 --> 22:56.960
The mom you are.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.796
The career woman you are.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.132
The wife you are

23:02.215 --> 23:04.968
to a man who is kind of a full-time job

23:05.051 --> 23:06.970
-in his own right.
-(chuckles)

23:08.054 --> 23:09.723
So I say

23:09.806 --> 23:13.768
if these traditional
dance academies are broken,

23:13.852 --> 23:15.020
go change them.

23:16.104 --> 23:19.315
Go in there and do what you always do.

23:20.316 --> 23:23.194
Blow us all away.

23:29.743 --> 23:33.288
-Okay. Let's do this.
-KATE: All right.

23:33.371 --> 23:34.748
Listen, full disclosure.
(chuckles)

23:34.831 --> 23:36.624
I gave Nicky the questions,
and he recorded this,

23:36.708 --> 23:39.044
so I have no idea what to expect.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.795
(Rebecca and Madison chuckle)

23:40.879 --> 23:43.340
<i>NICKY:</i>
<i>Where are the damn questions?</i>

23:43.423 --> 23:44.966
<i>Hello, ladies.</i>
<i>I hope you're enjoying</i>

23:45.050 --> 23:47.427
<i>Uncle Nicky's lovely, charming commentary.</i>

23:47.510 --> 23:49.387
-(all chuckle)
<i>-Here we go.</i>
<i>-NICKY: (groans) All right.</i>

23:49.471 --> 23:51.014
<i>Uh, first question.</i>

23:51.097 --> 23:55.310
<i>What is Madison's idea</i>
<i>of a perfect Sunday morning?</i>

23:55.393 --> 23:56.895
Okay, so, you're gonna answer,

23:56.978 --> 23:58.188
and then we'll see if he gets it right.

23:58.271 --> 24:01.191
Okay.
Um, well,

24:01.274 --> 24:04.069
I kind of can't stop daydreaming

24:04.152 --> 24:05.904
about when I'll be able to sleep in again.

24:05.987 --> 24:07.781
-(Rebecca chuckles)
-I think

24:07.864 --> 24:10.492
Kevin will say
that my perfect Sunday morning

24:10.575 --> 24:13.161
is sleeping till noon

24:13.244 --> 24:15.163
and then hanging with him and the twins

24:15.246 --> 24:16.915
-in bed.
-REBECCA: Hmm.

24:16.998 --> 24:18.583
-All right. Good answer.
-KATE: All right.

24:18.667 --> 24:19.793
-Let's see.
-BETH: Come on, Kev. (whoops)

24:19.876 --> 24:21.795
<i>Uh... Well, let's see.</i>

24:21.878 --> 24:24.255
<i>Um, she's been</i>

24:24.339 --> 24:26.675
<i>sort of fantasizing a lot lately</i>
<i>about sleeping in.</i>

24:26.758 --> 24:28.635
-REBECCA: Aw.
-(Madison laughs)
<i>-So I would say</i>

24:28.718 --> 24:30.637
<i>sleep till afternoon,</i>

24:30.720 --> 24:34.516
<i>um, and then cappuccino,</i>

24:34.599 --> 24:36.893
<i>and we invite the kids in,</i>

24:36.976 --> 24:40.605
<i>and we just sort of hang out</i>
<i>and cuddle in bed</i>

24:40.689 --> 24:43.358
<i>for the next couple hours</i>
<i>with Thing One and Thing Two.</i>

24:43.441 --> 24:46.027
-(Madison squeals)
-Aw.
-KATE: All right!

24:46.111 --> 24:47.487
-(Madison laughs)
-He knows your drink.

24:47.570 --> 24:48.947
<i>NICKY:</i>
<i>Now, that's the lamest thing</i>

24:49.030 --> 24:50.907
<i>-I ever heard. Um...</i>
<i>-Just ask the next...</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:54.953
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>Uh, describe Madison's dream</i>

24:55.036 --> 24:58.206
<i>for your future together</i>
<i>once you're empty nesters.</i>

24:59.874 --> 25:01.960
Oof. Okay.
That's a hard one.

25:02.043 --> 25:04.212
It feels so far away.

25:04.295 --> 25:06.256
Um...

25:06.339 --> 25:09.884
I hope we'll travel a lot.

25:09.968 --> 25:12.095
And go out

25:12.178 --> 25:15.140
for long, romantic dinners

25:15.223 --> 25:18.518
where we sit and talk
until they kick us out.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.312
Like those older couples you see

25:21.396 --> 25:23.440
who still haven't run out
of things to say to each other.

25:24.941 --> 25:28.153
Really, I just hope
that things will slow down

25:28.236 --> 25:29.696
and we can sort of...

25:29.779 --> 25:32.782
-discover the world
all over again. Together.
-Ah.

25:32.866 --> 25:35.577
Sorry.
That was a lot.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.579
-(laughs)
-KATE: So romantic.
-That was so beautiful.

25:37.662 --> 25:40.123
-It was the perfect answer.
-KATE: So sweet.

25:40.206 --> 25:42.208
Let's see what our Romeo says.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.127
(Madison laughs)

25:44.210 --> 25:48.173
<i>Dream of a future together</i>
<i>once we're empty nesters.</i>

25:48.256 --> 25:50.175
<i>-It's a trick question.</i>
<i>-NICKY: What do you mean?</i>

25:50.258 --> 25:51.801
<i>KEVIN:</i>
<i>Well, Madison knows</i>

25:51.885 --> 25:55.805
<i>that I refuse to grow old,</i>
<i>so the question is moot.</i>

25:55.889 --> 25:57.140
-(blows raspberry)
-Oh, my God.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.059
(laughs): I know Kevin
wants to stay 40 forever.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.144
-I should've guessed that.
-BETH: Boo.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.937
MADISON:
Okay. Next question.

26:03.021 --> 26:04.522
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

26:04.606 --> 26:06.107
SOPHIE:
There you are.

26:06.191 --> 26:07.400
Good, you're back.

26:07.484 --> 26:09.152
I wrote my mission statement.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.403
Your what?

26:10.487 --> 26:12.280
Like in <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

26:12.364 --> 26:14.157
His was about the future
of sports agencies.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.992
Mine is about my future with you.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.660
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

26:19.746 --> 26:21.373
"Sophie,

26:21.456 --> 26:22.874
"as you know,

26:22.957 --> 26:25.960
"I have big dreams
of becoming a famous actor.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.088
"I love you, Soph.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.256
"And I can see our whole lives together.

26:30.340 --> 26:32.634
"In a couple years,
we'll have another wedding.

26:32.717 --> 26:36.388
"A fancy one with guests
and cake and everything.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.682
"And then a couple years later,
we'll have kids.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.058
"And we'll be the kind of parents

26:40.141 --> 26:41.976
"that are disgustingly
in love with each other.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.603
"Like my parents were.

26:43.687 --> 26:46.815
"And one day, we'll be
that embarrassing couple

26:46.898 --> 26:49.442
"that dances to the piano
in an Italian restaurant

26:49.526 --> 26:52.028
"when nobody else is dancing.

26:52.112 --> 26:54.114
"That's my ultimate dream, Sophie.

26:54.197 --> 26:57.575
You and me to the very end."

27:00.662 --> 27:02.455
MADISON:
Earth to Kate. You got to hit

27:02.539 --> 27:04.040
-play so I can hear the next question.
-KATE: Sorry.

27:04.124 --> 27:05.667
-Yes. Yes, yes.
-(Beth and Madison chuckle)

27:05.750 --> 27:07.168
Uh, here we go.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.851
Rain's letting up.
Nicky found some dry firewood.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.020
He's got a nice fire going on outside.

27:25.103 --> 27:27.814
Think it's some kind
of caveman-esque peace offering.

27:28.898 --> 27:30.859
My old <i>Jerry Maguire </i>mission statement.

27:30.942 --> 27:33.194
-Ah.
-Yeah.

27:33.278 --> 27:35.864
Remember that?
So embarrassing.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.576
(laughs)

27:39.659 --> 27:42.704
No, man.
It's romantic.

27:42.787 --> 27:44.205
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.832
Ah.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.208
(Randall chuckles softly)

27:47.292 --> 27:50.253
Sophie reached out to me, and, um...

27:51.838 --> 27:53.423
I don't know.
She said she saw the article

27:53.506 --> 27:56.051
about me and Madison getting married,

27:56.134 --> 27:57.635
and she wanted to...

27:57.719 --> 28:00.764
call and congratulate me, so...

28:07.520 --> 28:09.773
I mean,

28:09.856 --> 28:12.484
how does anyone ever really know

28:12.567 --> 28:14.944
who they're supposed to marry?

28:18.698 --> 28:21.034
You know what, man?

28:21.117 --> 28:23.119
Come with me.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.205
-Yeah? All right.
-Come on.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.875
<i>Listen up,</i>

28:28.958 --> 28:32.379
fellas. Our boy here's
got a classic case of cold feet.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.130
I think he needs a good talking-to.

28:34.214 --> 28:36.174
-KEVIN: No, I'm fine.
-RANDALL: You are not fine,

28:36.257 --> 28:39.135
-sir. You are a mess.
-Uh... Okay.

28:39.219 --> 28:41.721
As for the rest of you,

28:41.805 --> 28:43.682
you're not on top of your game, either.

28:43.765 --> 28:45.266
Okay, Miguel,

28:45.350 --> 28:48.061
you have been obsessing
over our mother since you got here.

28:48.144 --> 28:50.230
Tobias, you are missing

28:50.313 --> 28:53.483
that usual je ne sais quoi
that makes you so appealing.

28:53.566 --> 28:54.818
And, Nicky...

28:54.901 --> 28:57.028
Well, you're always odd, so...

28:57.112 --> 28:58.363
(Miguel chuckles)

28:58.446 --> 29:00.031
So, what's up?
Who wants to go first?

29:00.115 --> 29:01.574
Come on.
Real talk.

29:01.658 --> 29:03.993
(clears throat)
This is the lamest bachelor party

29:04.077 --> 29:05.370
I've ever been to,
and I've never even been

29:05.453 --> 29:08.164
-to one.
-Nicky, shut it. Please.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.833
Who's first?

29:14.170 --> 29:17.424
I'm, like, the world's
greatest rom-com fan.

29:17.507 --> 29:19.551
Okay?
Like, th... Like, there's...

29:19.634 --> 29:21.845
there's literally never been

29:21.928 --> 29:24.556
a-a Hollywood ending
that I have not loved.

29:24.639 --> 29:28.143
And usually, I hate it,

29:28.226 --> 29:31.688
I <i>hate</i> it when people try to poke holes

29:31.771 --> 29:34.607
i-in the romantic ending.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.154
But after watching that movie,
I could only think one thing.

29:39.237 --> 29:42.282
They're just...
They're never gonna make it.

29:42.365 --> 29:44.701
Nothing has changed.

29:44.784 --> 29:47.037
All he did was deliver an incredible line

29:47.120 --> 29:49.622
to some divorce support group.
All right?

29:49.706 --> 29:50.999
Jerry is gonna work too hard.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.917
Dorothy's gonna resent him for that.

29:53.001 --> 29:54.878
And that little kid is gonna
get the short end of the stick

29:54.961 --> 29:56.546
'cause they'll never stop fighting,

29:56.629 --> 29:58.465
and soon he's gonna be mad and sad

29:58.548 --> 29:59.841
instead of adorable and precocious.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.426
And I could just see
their whole little family

30:01.509 --> 30:03.136
in-in-in this boat,

30:03.219 --> 30:06.014
and the boat
is just-just filled with holes.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.938
I'm s... I'm sorry.

30:14.022 --> 30:16.232
I'm sorry.
I'm in a weird place.

30:16.316 --> 30:18.401
I...
(laughing)

30:21.196 --> 30:24.616
I really, really need a new job.

30:24.699 --> 30:26.826
I need it financially,

30:26.910 --> 30:28.995
and I need it for my sanity.

30:29.079 --> 30:31.039
And I haven't had a nibble.

30:31.122 --> 30:32.499
Except for this one opportunity
in San Francisco,

30:32.582 --> 30:34.292
which is clearly a nonstarter

30:34.376 --> 30:37.962
for anybody with two kids under two, so...

30:39.964 --> 30:41.883
(sighs)

30:41.966 --> 30:44.177
RANDALL:
Tobias,

30:44.260 --> 30:46.888
you're gonna be okay.

30:47.972 --> 30:49.974
Your boat's gonna weather the storm.

30:50.058 --> 30:53.061
I promise you.

30:55.313 --> 30:58.650
(Nicky sighs)

30:58.733 --> 31:01.611
That movie...

31:01.695 --> 31:04.572
just-just put me in a bad mood.

31:06.574 --> 31:08.493
You know, like all romantic comedies do.

31:08.576 --> 31:12.205
I mean, and romantic dramas
and romantic dramedies.

31:12.288 --> 31:15.375
Yeah, you know, anything that...
where there's romance

31:15.458 --> 31:17.043
-involved...
-Yeah, we get it, Nicky.

31:17.127 --> 31:19.212
I just... I-I just can't relate to them.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.880
I just...

31:22.674 --> 31:26.386
I had one relationship 50 years ago.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.722
Sally Brooks.

31:28.805 --> 31:30.890
And I blew it.

31:30.974 --> 31:34.769
I blew it. I mean,
there's no second chances.

31:34.853 --> 31:36.980
There's no happy endings.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.148
I...

31:38.231 --> 31:40.483
I lost the girl.

31:40.567 --> 31:42.861
Roll credits.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.738
And, uh...

31:45.822 --> 31:48.366
And I think...

31:48.450 --> 31:50.910
I think that's why
I said all that stuff to you.

31:50.994 --> 31:54.873
I was just pissed off
about my own crappy love life.

31:56.082 --> 31:58.001
I'm sorry.

32:01.755 --> 32:04.215
Well, maybe you were onto something.

32:04.299 --> 32:06.092
You know?
I mean...

32:07.218 --> 32:09.637
Would Madison and I have ended up together

32:09.721 --> 32:11.890
if life hadn't thrown us
together in some weird way?

32:11.973 --> 32:13.391
I...

32:14.642 --> 32:16.436
I don't know.

32:20.065 --> 32:22.400
MIGUEL:
When your mother and I

32:22.484 --> 32:23.943
started seeing each other,

32:24.027 --> 32:27.530
I remember thinking a lot
about that expression

32:27.614 --> 32:29.699
"written in the stars."

32:29.783 --> 32:33.328
I'd always loved that expression.

32:33.411 --> 32:37.332
The idea that the universe had big plans

32:37.415 --> 32:42.253
for two strangers before
they've even crossed paths.

32:42.337 --> 32:46.049
I remember thinking that's how
it was for your mom and dad.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.259
Written in the stars.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.722
I knew it wasn't like that

32:52.806 --> 32:54.724
for me and her.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.393
It was...

32:56.476 --> 32:59.062
strange, the way we came together.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.980
I knew that.

33:01.064 --> 33:04.359
And I was filled with doubt
on our wedding day.

33:04.442 --> 33:07.112
For many days after.

33:07.195 --> 33:08.530
But then...

33:08.613 --> 33:11.282
the years went by.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.536
And I realized:

33:14.619 --> 33:16.538
it's okay.

33:16.621 --> 33:18.748
That, yes,

33:18.832 --> 33:22.836
there are some love stories
that are written in the stars.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.965
There are other love stories--

33:27.048 --> 33:28.842
they're written together.

33:30.010 --> 33:34.431
Two people the universe had no plans for

33:34.514 --> 33:37.767
writing their story in the stars together.

33:39.686 --> 33:42.355
That's pretty fantastic, too.

33:42.439 --> 33:44.566
Isn't it?

33:50.613 --> 33:54.034
I think Jerry and Dorothy made it, Kevin.

33:54.117 --> 33:56.036
I really do.

33:58.621 --> 34:01.332
(laughing)

34:02.417 --> 34:04.669
This is the strangest
bachelor party in history.

34:04.753 --> 34:06.087
Oh, it's borderline awful.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.505
-RANDALL: Yeah...
-(chuckles)

34:07.589 --> 34:11.509
Can the non-sober people
have, like, <i>a</i> beer?

34:11.593 --> 34:12.927
(laughter)

34:13.011 --> 34:14.846
Yeah, please.
Please do.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.222
Okay!

34:16.306 --> 34:18.183
(chuckles)

34:18.266 --> 34:20.101
Thank you, man.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.486
I said yes to meeting
on those jobs.

34:29.569 --> 34:32.072
Oh, Beths.
That's great.

34:32.155 --> 34:33.907
(chuckles)

34:33.990 --> 34:35.825
Thank you for earlier.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.327
What you said, you know?

34:37.410 --> 34:39.496
I just...
I really needed to hear it.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.039
Oh, please.
You're welcome.

34:41.122 --> 34:43.291
Hey, honestly, I should be thanking you.

34:43.375 --> 34:45.627
What?
Why?

34:45.710 --> 34:48.463
For opening up to me

34:48.546 --> 34:50.382
about what you've been going through.

34:50.465 --> 34:53.802
Y-You sharing with me like that
made me feel normal,

34:53.885 --> 34:55.887
not like...
(inhales)

34:55.970 --> 34:57.222
(sighs)
...not like some patient

34:57.305 --> 34:58.765
that everyone has to tip-toe around.

34:58.848 --> 35:01.184
What are you talking about?

35:01.267 --> 35:02.727
Miguel is...

35:02.811 --> 35:05.063
an angel.

35:05.146 --> 35:07.399
But I feel him worrying
about me all the time,

35:07.482 --> 35:09.734
and it can be oppressive.

35:09.818 --> 35:11.236
Mm.

35:11.319 --> 35:12.404
Kevin and Kate

35:12.487 --> 35:14.322
don't ask me to help out with their kids.

35:14.406 --> 35:16.991
And even Randall went on this...

35:17.075 --> 35:20.328
road trip to New Orleans
to find out about his birth mother,

35:20.412 --> 35:23.206
and he's barely even mentioned
a word of it to me, and...

35:23.289 --> 35:26.710
I don't know, maybe he thinks
that I can't handle it?

35:26.793 --> 35:29.129
But...

35:29.212 --> 35:30.922
today...

35:32.882 --> 35:36.136
...today, you made me feel like me again.

35:36.219 --> 35:37.595
Like a mom.

35:37.679 --> 35:40.515
And a girlfriend.

35:40.598 --> 35:42.517
Well, I'm not gonna stop
coming to you for pep talks

35:42.600 --> 35:44.269
-anytime soon, so...
-(chuckles)

35:45.353 --> 35:47.313
Same as I have all these years.

35:47.397 --> 35:48.898
-Okay. Thank you.
-Oh.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.358
Mm.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.110
Yeah.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.278
(phone chimes)

35:53.361 --> 35:54.320
Oh.

35:54.404 --> 35:55.989
-(car approaches)
-Yep.

35:56.072 --> 35:58.324
-That's me.
-Mm.

35:58.408 --> 36:00.160
-Bye.
-Bye.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.914
Oh, Rebecca?

36:04.998 --> 36:08.168
If you want to find out about
Randall's trip to New Orleans,

36:08.251 --> 36:09.586
just ask him.

36:09.669 --> 36:12.422
(departing footsteps)

36:12.505 --> 36:13.923
(car door opens)

36:14.007 --> 36:18.595
Kate, that red velvet cake was insane.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.597
You outdid yourself.

36:24.642 --> 36:26.269
Madison, I need to ask you something.

36:27.354 --> 36:28.938
And it's something I should
have asked you a long time ago.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.149
And I should have asked you
because you're my best friend.

36:31.232 --> 36:33.234
(inhales, sighs)

36:33.318 --> 36:36.029
But Kevin is my brother
and so it makes it delicate.

36:36.112 --> 36:38.865
But I need you just to tell me,

36:38.948 --> 36:40.075
you know, best friend to best friend...

36:43.495 --> 36:44.871
Are you happy?

36:44.954 --> 36:46.289
Is Kevin what you were looking for?

36:46.373 --> 36:48.750
Like, is he everything that you deserve?

36:50.210 --> 36:52.462
I didn't know what to expect out of him,

36:52.545 --> 36:53.755
honestly.

36:53.838 --> 36:54.756
(chuckles)

36:54.839 --> 36:56.841
All that fame.

36:56.925 --> 36:58.551
All those abs.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.471
(chuckles)
The face.

37:02.889 --> 37:05.684
But that movie star brother of yours

37:05.767 --> 37:09.854
has stepped up in ways
I never could have imagined.

37:10.855 --> 37:13.108
I love him, Kate.

37:13.191 --> 37:14.818
I really do.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.446
And, Kate...

37:19.823 --> 37:22.909
...girlfriends do not come easy for me,

37:22.992 --> 37:27.539
as you can probably tell
by my guest list today.

37:28.665 --> 37:31.793
Nothing will ever get in the way of that.

37:32.877 --> 37:34.004
You got that right.

37:34.087 --> 37:36.089

37:54.941 --> 37:56.109
I had a lot of fun.

37:56.192 --> 37:58.319

38:46.826 --> 38:48.620
Oh.
I'm sorry.

38:48.703 --> 38:51.331
I should have mentioned that
I was bringing the kids here

-for the weekend.
