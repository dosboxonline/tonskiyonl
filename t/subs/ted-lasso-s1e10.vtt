WEBVTT

00:14.806 --> 00:15.807
Right.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.446
Who the hell are you?

00:29.530 --> 00:32.573
Oh, hi! Hello. I'm Will.
I'm the new clubhouse attendant.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.826
No, you're not.
I'm the clubhouse attendant.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.328
Hey, Higgins, where are you?

00:36.411 --> 00:37.496
Ted, what the fuck's going on?

00:37.579 --> 00:39.206
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out myself.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.333
-Figure what out? Have I been sacked?
-Has he been fired?

00:41.416 --> 00:42.918
I don't know anything about this, Ted.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.002
-There you are.
-There you are.

00:44.086 --> 00:45.879
-Is this because I called Isaac a pussy?
-I don't know--

00:45.963 --> 00:46.964
Good morning, everyone.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.550
You shrew. You did this, didn't you?

00:49.633 --> 00:51.051
Why so hostile, Nathan?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.386
Right, I'll tell you why--

00:52.928 --> 00:53.929
You know my name?

00:54.012 --> 00:56.557
Well, I had to spell it correctly
for your contract.

00:57.641 --> 00:59.893
Nate-dawg, you haven't been fired.
It's worse.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.145
You've been promoted.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.324
Nate! Nate! Nate!

01:26.962 --> 01:30.174
Nathan Shelley,
I present to you this whistle.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.259
But it is sad. Do you know why?

01:32.342 --> 01:34.845
-No.
-Because it has never been blown.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.555
Is that the same reason why Colin's sad?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.895
By the power vested in me by
the Associative Football Club of Richmond,

01:42.978 --> 01:45.814
I now pronounce you Coach Nate.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.858
Thanks a lot. Thank you.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.111
No, no! Not inside.

01:51.195 --> 01:52.196
Sorry. Sorry.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.595
It got confusing,
'cause they don't call it jock itch here.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.138
So you didn't know what spray to buy?

02:18.222 --> 02:19.640
-Yeah.
-Yeah. What'd you go with?

02:19.723 --> 02:20.724
Mr Muscle.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.100
Huh.

02:22.184 --> 02:23.310
Hey, Roy.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.314
Not sure if you know this, but the rules
say you gotta pick a new captain.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.398
Oh.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.236
No, sir. You're my captain.
That's the rule.

02:32.319 --> 02:36.240
No. The captain has to be
on the pitch. That's the rule.

02:37.282 --> 02:40.244
I say that the current captain
has to pick the new captain.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.828
That's my new rule.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.205
Don't want to.

02:43.288 --> 02:44.289
Well, you have to.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.918
-I decline.
-I insist.

02:48.585 --> 02:49.586
Can't make me.

02:50.212 --> 02:53.757
Roy Kent, until you choose your successor,

02:53.841 --> 02:58.262
your duties as captain of this squad
remain unfulfilled.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.140
This is why it's hard to love you.

03:04.935 --> 03:05.936
You heard it, right?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.813
He loves you.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.065
All right, gang. Here's the unskinny bop.

03:10.148 --> 03:13.402
Manchester City is coming into our house
for the final match,

03:13.485 --> 03:16.238
but preparation-wise, we gonna
treat it like it's any other game.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.949
But it's not just any other game.
We could get relegated.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.994
We got relegated when I was at Cardiff.
It's my family's team.

03:22.077 --> 03:23.787
My nana never spoke to me after that.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.539
She just left me a box of her shit
in her will.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.791
Yeah, and when clubs go down,
teams get broken up.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.252
Coach, do they not have relegation
in America?

03:30.335 --> 03:31.670
Oh, no, no, no.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.881
So what happens to all the shit teams
at the end of the season?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.591
They play out the rest of the schedule,

03:35.674 --> 03:37.759
going through the motions
in meaningless games

03:37.843 --> 03:39.887
contested in lifeless,
half-empty stadiums,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.638
and everyone's pretty much fine with that.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.057
-That sound about right, Coach?
-Yeah, it's dumb.

03:44.975 --> 03:46.768
All right. Now, Coach Nate--

03:46.852 --> 03:48.020
No, no, no.

03:48.103 --> 03:49.521
-Not-- No, not here.
-Not inside.

03:49.605 --> 03:52.149
I was saying, now Coach Nate
has a video he wants to show.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.442
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

03:53.525 --> 03:59.031
Okay. So, I thought
you'd all find this motivational.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.574
All right.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.035
<i>Amigo</i> Jamie.

04:03.118 --> 04:04.703
Clearly no barbers in Manchester.

04:06.330 --> 04:08.790
<i>Well, I'd never say a bad word
about me old club...</i>

04:11.001 --> 04:12.920
<i>even though I did carry them
through every match.</i>

04:13.003 --> 04:14.546
<i>But they're good lads.</i>

04:14.630 --> 04:16.464
<i>Apart from Roy Kent. He is a knob.</i>

04:17.257 --> 04:21.011
<i>You know, and it's nice to have
a real manager like Pep,</i>

04:21.094 --> 04:22.804
<i>instead of that American rodeo clown.</i>

04:23.639 --> 04:26.850
<i>You know, Lasso sent me away,
now they're facing the drop.</i>

04:26.934 --> 04:29.269
<i>Sunday,
I get to put the final nail in the ashes.</i>

04:29.353 --> 04:31.271
<i>Instant karma, it's gonna get ya.</i>

04:34.441 --> 04:35.442
Oops, innit?

04:35.526 --> 04:36.401
Well said.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.861
All right, let's go climb that mountain!

04:39.321 --> 04:41.281
<i>Okay, so if the Premier League
is the best,</i>

04:41.365 --> 04:43.534
then what's the league called
right below it?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.118
The Championship.

04:45.202 --> 04:48.413
Now, hold on one second. So if you come
in last place in the Premier League,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.082
you get to play in the Championship?

04:50.165 --> 04:52.376
They also invented irony.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.837
Man, this town has got a weird way
with words, don't it?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.756
I mean, come on, y'all. It's 2020.
Let's just call 'em cigarettes.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.842
-Oh, God, yeah.
-You know what I mean?

05:00.551 --> 05:01.760
Hey. How you doing, fellas?

05:02.427 --> 05:04.638
We just wanted to say thanks.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.139
Yeah, we know you did your best.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.058
Even though your best is still shit.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.060
-Baz.
-Oh, come on, now.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.479
You're acting like
we lost the game already, yeah?

05:12.563 --> 05:14.189
Why don't you have a little hope?

05:15.899 --> 05:19.361
Aw, Ted. Haven't you lived here
long enough to realize?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.530
It's the hope that kills you.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.995
Why don't you text Nate?
We got a little work to do tonight, huh?

05:29.246 --> 05:33.750
Okay, come on. We got this.
Look, we win, we're in, okay?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.837
There is a scenario where Crystal Palace
beat Norwich by six goals,

05:36.920 --> 05:38.672
and we avoid relegation with just a tie.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.841
No, no, no. Nope. Sorry.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.217
No. I hate ties, Nate.

05:42.301 --> 05:44.595
How many times I gotta tell you that?
They ain't natural, all right?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.930
If God wanted games to end in a tie,

05:47.014 --> 05:48.765
she wouldn't have invented numbers,
all right?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.893
Come on, guys. Let's fire up. Let's go.

05:50.976 --> 05:53.770
For the love of Meghan Markle, do not
blow that whistle again, Nate. I swear.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.147
-Sorry.
-I got neighbors upstairs,

05:55.230 --> 05:57.774
and they will just start stomping away.
Okay?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.235
Come on.
Tell me how we beat Manchester City.

06:00.319 --> 06:02.404
-We cannot beat Manchester City.
-Dang it, Nate!

06:02.487 --> 06:05.115
That is not what I want to hear
from my assistant coach on his first day.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.366
It is hopeless.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.495
Oh, I'm sorry. It's hopeless?

06:10.579 --> 06:11.955
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

06:23.509 --> 06:26.178
Quick question.
Are those the only clothes you own?

06:26.261 --> 06:28.096
This? No, I got three of these.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.939
That ring a bell, Nate?
That ring a very large bell in your head?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.565
You had that hanging in your home?

06:38.649 --> 06:41.235
I got a ton of these hanging up in here.
This one's from the bathroom mirror.

06:41.318 --> 06:44.112
It's the first thing I see every morning,
and it's the last thing I see at night

06:44.196 --> 06:45.864
when I rationalize
being too tired to floss.

06:47.658 --> 06:49.368
Belief can't score goals, Coach.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.036
Well, hello, Nelson.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.288
Let me introduce you
to another Nelson right here.

06:53.372 --> 06:57.417
I think you two will hit it off just fine,
'cause you're both so damn pessimistic!

06:59.169 --> 07:00.587
Sorry, Ms. Shipley!

07:00.671 --> 07:04.091
I believe the gentleman is suggesting
that we are a pair of Negative Nellies.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.551
Oh, right.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.261
Jackpot.

07:08.846 --> 07:11.265
Morning, boss. Here you are.

07:11.640 --> 07:16.353
Oh. Ted. I sense you're carrying around
something today besides biscuits.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.021
Good eye, small fry.

07:22.401 --> 07:23.569
I hate to say it, Rebecca,

07:23.652 --> 07:27.072
but I think your football club might have
been better off with a soccer coach.

07:27.155 --> 07:28.282
Where's this coming from?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.492
Look, if we do end up losing on Sunday,

07:30.576 --> 07:33.453
you just go ahead and do whatever you
think is best for the future of this club,

07:33.537 --> 07:34.538
you understand?

07:34.621 --> 07:37.207
Even if that means this guy's gotta go...

07:38.000 --> 07:41.253
You know, you put that thing, and just...
You know, whatever you got.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.046
Whatever you wanna do.
I mean, don't really murder me,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.841
but, you know, just...
All that. You get what I'm getting at?

07:45.924 --> 07:47.593
-Fire me. You get the gist. Yeah.
-Okay. Okay.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.928
So you think you're not
a "proper" football manager.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.973
Someone who's never played the game
before, or knows the rules.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.017
No, I don't know jack diddly
about any of it.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.145
But who cares?
There's a great saying in Dutch football.

07:58.228 --> 07:59.479
Oh, I don't speak Dutch.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.398
That's why I was going to tell you
in English.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.774
Perfect. Lay it on me.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.611
"Every disadvantage has its advantage."

08:06.111 --> 08:07.112
Ooh, I like that.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.822
Sure, you don't know what you're doing,

08:08.906 --> 08:11.158
but doesn't that mean
that you see the game in a different way

08:11.241 --> 08:12.993
than any other football manager?

08:14.203 --> 08:17.873
And shouldn't that empower you
to cause complete and utter confusion?

08:18.540 --> 08:22.252
Cause confusion or create chaos.

08:22.336 --> 08:25.380
Yep. Yes, it is. Thanks, boss.

08:29.927 --> 08:30.928
I'm fine.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.095
Oh, my God.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.597
The chaos has already begun.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.893
All right, gentlemen.
School is in session.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.104
And today's lesson is "trick plays."

08:41.188 --> 08:42.813
At least, that's what
we call 'em back home.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.942
-What do they call 'em here again?
-Elaborate set pieces.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.319
Yeah, we gonna stick with "trick plays."
That's a lot more fun.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.196
Now, the idea behind every trick play

08:49.279 --> 08:54.535
is to have chaos rain down
upon your opponents and stun them.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.204
Much like the lava did
to those poor folks in Pompeii.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.874
So, I want y'all to think about
every single trick play you have ever run

09:00.958 --> 09:03.252
your entire time playing this sport.
Anybody got one?

09:03.335 --> 09:04.336
Yeah, Dani, what you got?

09:04.419 --> 09:06.880
When I played for Tigres,
we had a great set piece.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.465
-Did it have a name?
-"The Sandman."

09:08.549 --> 09:11.635
Yeah. Now we're cooking. "The Sandman."

09:11.718 --> 09:13.387
We're gonna learn that play today.
Who else got one?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.930
-"Pepper Shakers."
-"Pepper Shakers"?

09:15.013 --> 09:16.348
Yeah, plural. Gotta be two.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.558
"Beckham's Todger."

09:17.641 --> 09:19.393
Beckham, I know. Todger, I don't know.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.061
-It's dirty.
-Okay.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.229
"Midnight Poutine."

09:22.312 --> 09:23.981
-Poutine?
-That's not dirty.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.774
It's just super Canadian.

09:25.858 --> 09:27.901
-"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang."
-Oh, with Dick Van Dyke.

09:27.985 --> 09:31.738
The owner of one of the most authentic
English accents in the history of cinema.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.073
-What do you got?
-"The Broken Tap."

09:33.156 --> 09:35.200
All right. That's not a complaint,
that's an actual play name?

09:35.284 --> 09:37.411
Think Man City will leak
a lot of goals from it.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.204
Whoa!

09:39.288 --> 09:40.497
Oh. Nice. Yeah?

09:40.581 --> 09:42.833
-"Loki's Toboggan."
-"The Upside-Down Taxi."

09:42.916 --> 09:45.085
-"Hadrian's Wall."
-"Dirty Martini."

09:45.169 --> 09:48.005
Oh, I'd love to run that play
three times right now. I love it.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.965
Do me a favor
and toss "Lasso Special" up there

09:50.048 --> 09:51.216
just for the heck of it too.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.885
All right, guys. Tell you right now,

09:52.968 --> 09:55.929
we're gonna go out there, and we're gonna
learn a bunch of these plays, you hear?

09:56.013 --> 09:59.850
Come Sunday, we're gonna hit
Man City with the chaos hammer!

09:59.933 --> 10:01.977
-Yeah!
-Let's go!

10:06.732 --> 10:08.567
No. Sam, not wax.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.653
-Ah, okay.
-Pomade. Pomade.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.449
Yo, Jamie Tartt. It's you, yeah?

10:16.909 --> 10:18.243
Let me get an ussie.

10:18.327 --> 10:19.494
A what?

10:19.995 --> 10:20.996
Oh.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.666
Wicked.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.793
I can't believe
you got dumped by Richmond.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.337
Super embarrassing for you, yeah?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.131
Well, I got fucked by Lasso. So...

10:31.215 --> 10:33.800
He likes you now though.
He talked about you on telly, didn't he?

10:34.676 --> 10:36.762
What are you on about, you posh twat?

10:36.845 --> 10:40.682
<i>Trent Crimm,</i> The Independent.
<i>Any bad blood between you and Jamie Tartt?</i>

10:40.766 --> 10:43.143
<i>Jamie? No.
That's a special young man right there.</i>

10:43.227 --> 10:45.020
<i>Got talent for days, works hard,</i>

10:45.103 --> 10:47.523
<i>and he's got a jawline
like the White Cliffs of Dover.</i>

10:47.606 --> 10:48.941
<i>I'm always rootin' for him.</i>

10:49.024 --> 10:50.859
-What?
-Classic mind games, innit?

10:52.152 --> 10:53.737
Right. You can fuck off.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.239
Whoa!

11:06.375 --> 11:08.585
You're fucking joking.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.633
Oh, yeah, Roy, Jamie's coming over.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.177
Oh, is he? Shall I make scones?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.345
I don't like scones.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.138
I'm not making scones, you idiot.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.099
Good, 'cause I don't even like 'em.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.102
What's that?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.395
I made you coffee.

11:27.771 --> 11:28.772
Well, then, what's this?

11:28.856 --> 11:29.982
I brought you coffee.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.525
Oh.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.199
All right, Jamie, what was it
that you wanted to talk about?

11:39.283 --> 11:41.493
Not gonna say it
in front of this dry old shit.

11:42.077 --> 11:43.912
Why? He won't say anything. Will you?

11:46.373 --> 11:47.374
Missed.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.794
Ted Lasso is trying to play
fucking mind games with me.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.630
Saying nice shit about me on the telly.
Trying to get in my head.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.049
-He does like you.
-You're as full of shit as he is.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.177
Oi. Mind your fucking manners.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.386
All right, RoboCop.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.723
Jamie, not everyone in your life
is out to get you.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.308
I am.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.644
What? Thought you respected honesty.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.896
I do.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.649
Oh, that is disgusting.

12:13.192 --> 12:16.528
Look, Keeley. When you're done
feeding mushy peas to this old fart,

12:16.612 --> 12:17.821
then you give me a call.

12:18.780 --> 12:21.742
Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Enjoy the view from the bench.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.290
What?

12:28.832 --> 12:30.459
Well, now I want mushy peas.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.297
<i>Dad, when I see you coach soccer on TV,</i>

12:35.380 --> 12:38.217
<i>it doesn't look like
you're doing anything.</i>

12:38.300 --> 12:41.970
Well, it's 'cause I'm not. All right?

12:42.054 --> 12:44.264
It ain't like being a football coach
back home, kiddo.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.892
I got a lot less control,
'cause once the game gets going,

12:46.975 --> 12:48.519
I can't tell my fellas what to do.

12:48.602 --> 12:50.812
So I just gotta hope that everything
I've been trying to teach 'em

12:50.896 --> 12:52.356
made some sort of impact on 'em,

12:52.439 --> 12:55.609
and that they'll make the right decisions
when they're out there on their own.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.028
You know, it's kind of like being a dad,
I guess, huh?

13:00.155 --> 13:02.324
How much did you get of that
before you checked out?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.785
-<i>I drew a robot.</i>
-That's cool, bud.

13:06.078 --> 13:08.580
<i>The Richmond faithful
gather on a crucial night.</i>

13:08.664 --> 13:11.959
<i>Win and they stay up.
Lose and they go down.</i>

13:12.042 --> 13:15.170
<i>They come here full of hope,
but as they know all too well,</i>

13:15.254 --> 13:16.839
<i>it's the hope that kills you.</i>

13:16.922 --> 13:17.923
Oh, this sport.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.592
I'd forgotten how stressful it is
when you actually give a shit.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.637
I have a confession to make.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.223
I've never really cared about football.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.810
I know. I know it sounds insane,
but I know how to act at a match.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.895
"Referee!"

13:32.521 --> 13:34.398
"Offside, you turnip!"

13:34.481 --> 13:36.525
-God, you're awful.
-You believed me.

13:37.401 --> 13:40.195
It's just that my heart has never really
been in it, you know?

13:41.864 --> 13:43.031
But today...

13:45.868 --> 13:47.578
today, I care very much.

13:50.289 --> 13:53.834
Arlo White here, with former
England international, Chris Powell,

13:53.917 --> 13:56.670
live from the Dogtrack,
Nelson Road Stadium,

13:56.753 --> 13:58.463
the home of AFC Richmond,

13:58.547 --> 14:00.799
<i>who tonight
host the mighty Manchester City.</i>

14:00.883 --> 14:02.176
Yoo-hoo! You like my new shirt?

14:03.302 --> 14:04.511
Well, look at you.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.722
<i>It's David meets Goliath.</i>

14:06.805 --> 14:09.558
<i>If David forgot
to put his stone in his slingshot, Arlo.</i>

14:09.641 --> 14:10.642
These are on me.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.102
Thanks, Mae.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.104
-Good luck group hug?
-No.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.983
-Richmond.
-Richmond.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.945
Okay, here we are. Family Higgins.

14:22.029 --> 14:27.326
This is Terry, Kris, Dana, Stevie.

14:27.409 --> 14:30.579
How many kids do you have, Higgins?
Jesus Christ.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.831
And this is our eldest, Lindsay.

14:32.915 --> 14:33.916
Good evening.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.709
Forgive me, Father.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.712
Don't worry. He's a cool priest.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.380
When your parents have you out of wedlock,

14:40.464 --> 14:43.425
it allows you space
to explore life's little gray areas.

14:43.509 --> 14:45.594
-Come on, Richmond!
-Come on!

14:46.428 --> 14:48.680
<i>With the Richmond fans
in full voice, Chris,</i>

14:48.764 --> 14:52.559
<i>how do the players in the locker room
feel to be on the brink of relegation?</i>

14:53.185 --> 14:55.437
<i>It's a tremendous amount
of pressure, Arlo.</i>

14:55.521 --> 14:59.149
<i>To get the result they need, it will
have to start with veteran leadership.</i>

15:02.528 --> 15:03.737
Isaac.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.572
Yeah?

15:09.785 --> 15:11.578
Never stop breaking TVs.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.178
All right, now, fellas.
Hey, let's focus up, huh?

15:32.683 --> 15:37.604
So I've been hearing this phrase y'all got
over here that I ain't too crazy about.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.691
"It's the hope that kills you."

15:42.693 --> 15:43.694
Y'all know that?

15:46.154 --> 15:47.698
I disagree, you know?

15:48.991 --> 15:51.493
I think it's the lack of hope
that comes and gets you.

15:53.161 --> 15:54.663
See, I believe in hope.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.457
I believe in belief.

15:59.793 --> 16:03.380
Now, where I'm from,
we got a saying too, yeah?

16:04.298 --> 16:05.966
A question, actually.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.927
"Do you believe in miracles?"

16:11.388 --> 16:13.891
Now, I don't need y'all
to answer that question for me...

16:15.267 --> 16:18.103
but I do want you to answer
that question for yourselves.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.188
Right now.

16:20.522 --> 16:23.650
Do you believe in miracles?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.404
And if you do...

16:29.281 --> 16:31.867
then I want y'all to circle up with me
right now. Come on. Let's go.

16:33.619 --> 16:34.745
Get 'em in here.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.124
All right, Captain. Let 'em know.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.423
Let's go, Skipper, let's go.

16:47.466 --> 16:48.926
All right, Captain. Let 'em know.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.053
Richmond on 12.

16:51.929 --> 16:55.265
One, two, three,

16:55.349 --> 16:59.186
four, five, six,

16:59.269 --> 17:03.565
seven, nine, ten, eleven, twelve!

17:03.649 --> 17:05.400
Richmond!

17:05.483 --> 17:07.069
Go Richmond!

17:07.903 --> 17:09.363
Let's go!

17:09.445 --> 17:11.531
Is that miracle thing
from a movie or real life?

17:11.615 --> 17:12.616
Both.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.868
Among the many subplots,
the return of Jamie Tartt,

17:15.953 --> 17:18.121
<i>who enjoyed a successful loan period here,</i>

17:18.204 --> 17:23.001
<i>but had an infamous on-pitch dustup
with Roy Kent, who is not starting today.</i>

17:23.085 --> 17:24.294
<i>I really can't remember</i>

17:24.377 --> 17:26.630
<i>seeing Roy Kent on the bench
for a big match.</i>

17:27.673 --> 17:29.299
Hey, Jamie! Good luck!

17:30.259 --> 17:31.969
Fucking mind games.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.680
<i>It's Richmond versus Manchester City.</i>

17:34.763 --> 17:36.098
And we're off.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.432
Here we go.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.895
<i>Hendrick takes. Outside for Corwin.</i>

17:41.979 --> 17:43.689
<i>Oh, and he puts Tartt through on goal.</i>

17:44.273 --> 17:45.566
No, no, no.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.359
<i>He has a man open to his left.</i>

17:48.193 --> 17:49.403
<i>But he takes it himself!</i>

17:50.070 --> 17:51.572
<i>And Zoreaux is there.</i>

17:53.365 --> 17:54.408
Nice stop!

17:54.491 --> 17:56.493
That's a solid save from Zorro.

17:56.577 --> 17:58.328
Yeah, Chris. It's pronounced "Zoreaux."

17:58.871 --> 18:02.583
<i>Thirty minutes gone. Richmond with
an opportunity here on the counterattack.</i>

18:02.666 --> 18:05.377
<i>Obisanya with
an inch-perfect through ball.</i>

18:05.460 --> 18:07.796
<i>Winchester was clearly offside.</i>

18:07.880 --> 18:09.173
Come on, now!

18:09.256 --> 18:11.216
-Explain to me how that's offsides.
-What?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.720
No, I'm serious. How is that offside?
I don't understand that yet. You--

18:15.345 --> 18:18.348
<i>And here comes Lasso's
assistant coach to review their tactics.</i>

18:18.432 --> 18:20.100
<i>What chess moves do they have in store?</i>

18:20.184 --> 18:22.352
When the vinegar was next
to the Heineken, they weren't offside.

18:22.436 --> 18:23.979
It's not when the vinegar
catches the ball,

18:24.062 --> 18:25.647
it's when ketchup passes the ball.

18:25.731 --> 18:27.024
-Yes, I understand now.
-Okay.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.526
<i>A shot from Dixon--
Pushed over the bar.</i>

18:29.610 --> 18:30.611
Corner, corner!

18:30.694 --> 18:32.905
<i>Agony for Dixon,
but a corner for Richmond.</i>

18:32.988 --> 18:34.198
Come on, Richmond!

18:34.281 --> 18:35.741
Corner kick, corner kick.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.951
-Go for the Sandman. Call Sandman.
-What? Sandman.

18:38.035 --> 18:40.412
Sandman! Guys, the Sandman!

18:40.954 --> 18:42.414
-Sandman!
-Here we go.

18:42.497 --> 18:43.999
<i>Rojas to take the corner.</i>

18:45.584 --> 18:47.711
<i>It's a dummy. Oh, and another one.
What is this?</i>

18:47.794 --> 18:49.338
<i>Dixon again!</i>

18:49.421 --> 18:51.173
<i>No! Hamlin saves with his foot.</i>

18:51.256 --> 18:52.466
Shit.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.512
Ooh, baby, the Sandman almost
rocked 'em to sleep right there.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.598
-<i>A bit of trickery from Ted Lasso.</i>
-<i>Haven't seen that one before.</i>

18:59.681 --> 19:01.850
Nice move though. Nice move.

19:03.185 --> 19:06.438
<i>And that's halftime. The score is 0-0</i>.

19:06.939 --> 19:09.441
<i>Shockingly, Richmond are still in this,</i>

19:09.525 --> 19:12.611
<i>thanks to the stellar play
of Zoreaux in goal.</i>

19:12.694 --> 19:14.321
Okay, well, you got-- It's Reynolds.

19:14.404 --> 19:16.198
No, you got to shore up your defense.
You have to--

19:16.281 --> 19:18.325
Okay, you know what? Never mind.
I'm just gonna go with my gut.

19:18.408 --> 19:19.868
Somebody check the Crystal Palace score.

19:19.952 --> 19:21.537
Hey, no. No, no, no. Absolutely not.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.498
I don't want to hear about any other game
going on any other place.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.209
Okay? Look, we are not playing for a tie.

19:27.292 --> 19:29.169
Ain't nobody here gonna kiss their sister.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.004
What?

19:31.713 --> 19:35.592
Which is an American phrase that
I'm now realizing does not exist here,

19:35.676 --> 19:37.261
and that's good, 'cause it's creepy,

19:37.344 --> 19:39.263
and I hate it myself,
I don't know why I said it.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.557
I think it's just the adrenaline,
the nerves and all that.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.642
But we are playing for a win.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.936
Win and in. You hear?

19:46.937 --> 19:49.356
-I can't hear your nods. Do you hear me?
-Yes, Coach.

19:49.439 --> 19:51.942
Okay, good. All right.
Roy, you are starting the second half.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.527
Go ahead and start warming up. Let's go.

19:53.610 --> 19:54.862
Gentlemen, follow me.

19:59.283 --> 20:02.077
And here comes Roy Kent.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.913
Roy-o!

20:05.497 --> 20:07.457
<i>A surprising move from Lasso.</i>

20:07.541 --> 20:09.835
<i>Manchester City's speed
is causing Richmond problems,</i>

20:09.918 --> 20:14.256
<i>and he brings on Roy Kent,
who is, to be polite, very slow.</i>

20:14.339 --> 20:17.009
That's 'cause he's a fucking octogenarian.
Look at him.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.052
<i>City with a real opportunity here.</i>

20:19.136 --> 20:20.846
<i>Scharfenberg into the box.</i>

20:20.929 --> 20:23.599
<i>Oh, it's a penalty against Richmond.</i>

20:23.682 --> 20:25.601
-How? How?
-He didn't touch him!

20:25.684 --> 20:29.062
<i>Zoreaux in position. Hendrick to take.</i>

20:31.231 --> 20:32.608
<i>He scores.</i>

20:35.444 --> 20:38.906
<i>City finally get past Zoreaux,
and it's 1-0.</i>

20:38.989 --> 20:40.949
<i>It's the goal that's been coming.</i>

20:41.033 --> 20:44.661
<i>City take the lead,
and the Dogtrack falls silent.</i>

20:44.745 --> 20:47.664
We're only one goal down.
There's still a chance. Come on, Richmond!

20:47.748 --> 20:49.166
I love you when you give a shit.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.085
Go, Richmond!

20:52.169 --> 20:54.254
<i>Jamie Tartt with the breakaway.</i>

20:54.338 --> 20:57.174
<i>If he scores here,
it could be curtains for Richmond.</i>

20:58.175 --> 20:59.384
<i>No one can catch him.</i>

21:00.511 --> 21:01.470
Go, Roy, go!

21:03.889 --> 21:07.976
<i>Hold on. Can you believe it? It's Kent!</i>

21:12.022 --> 21:13.857
Yeah! Attaboy, Roy!

21:13.941 --> 21:15.234
Roy! Roy!

21:15.317 --> 21:18.946
<i>Once again,
the tortoise has stopped the hare.</i>

21:19.029 --> 21:21.365
That's how you put him down, Roy!

21:24.868 --> 21:25.953
What's the matter?

21:26.620 --> 21:27.663
He's not getting up.

21:27.746 --> 21:29.706
<i>Now this looks serious.</i>

21:29.790 --> 21:33.168
<i>It was a fair tackle on Tartt,
but Kent may have paid the price.</i>

21:33.252 --> 21:35.254
-<i>And they're sending out the physio.</i>
-Get up, Roy!

21:35.337 --> 21:37.172
Roy. Roy, are you okay?

21:37.256 --> 21:40.175
Fuck. I fucked my knee.

21:40.259 --> 21:43.053
-Want me to call for the stretcher, Roy?
-No, just help me up.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.139
Roy Kent!
He's here, he's there...

21:46.223 --> 21:47.599
What the fuck are you doing?

21:47.683 --> 21:49.268
...he's every-fucking-where. Roy Kent!

21:49.351 --> 21:50.352
Listen.

21:50.435 --> 21:53.313
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there,

21:53.397 --> 21:55.440
he's every-fucking-where. Roy Kent!

21:55.941 --> 21:58.819
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there,

21:58.902 --> 22:03.323
he's every-fucking-where.
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

22:03.407 --> 22:06.159
He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where.

22:06.243 --> 22:07.452
Roy Kent!

22:07.536 --> 22:11.957
<i>Well, we apologize for the fruity language
as the crowd serenades Roy Kent</i>

22:12.040 --> 22:15.878
<i>with a song that's echoed through
the Premier League for more than a decade.</i>

22:15.961 --> 22:18.380
He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where...

22:18.463 --> 22:19.840
<i>And he's getting up.</i>

22:19.923 --> 22:22.301
Roy Kent!

22:22.384 --> 22:24.636
<i>Roy Kent will never leave on a stretcher.</i>

22:26.138 --> 22:32.269
Roy Kent! He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where! Roy Kent!

22:32.352 --> 22:33.770
Roy Kent!

22:34.271 --> 22:36.940
He's here, he's there,
he's every-fucking-where!

22:37.024 --> 22:40.360
Roy Kent! Roy Kent!

22:40.819 --> 22:43.906
<i>As Kent comes off,
he claps the fans in gratitude.</i>

22:43.989 --> 22:45.490
<i>Kent has been a fan favorite</i>

22:45.574 --> 22:48.827
<i>because he always left everything he had
out on the pitch,</i>

22:48.911 --> 22:50.412
<i>and he did so tonight.</i>

22:54.416 --> 22:57.753
<i>Chris, does this almost feel
like a farewell to you?</i>

22:59.671 --> 23:01.215
<i>Well, you have to wonder, Arlo.</i>

23:01.298 --> 23:03.842
<i>At his age, with that injury...</i>

23:04.760 --> 23:06.428
<i>Personally, I'm sorry to say,</i>

23:06.512 --> 23:10.766
<i>I think this may be the last time we ever
see the great Roy Kent lace up his boots.</i>

23:28.492 --> 23:30.410
You're not allowed back here
during a game.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.625
I told you, you have to get out.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.088
I mean it. Stay the fuck away from me.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.330
What the heck is going on--

24:16.290 --> 24:18.917
That's the sound of 26,000 people
checking mobiles.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.549
Oh, my God. Palace won 6-0.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.342
But then that means...

24:28.218 --> 24:29.511
All we need is a tie.

24:29.595 --> 24:32.347
-We just need a tie, boys!
-We just need a tie!

24:32.431 --> 24:33.974
Come on! Let's go!

24:35.767 --> 24:37.269
Come on, Richmond!

24:39.104 --> 24:43.525
Three minutes of added time
is all that's left in Richmond's season.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.402
<i>Montlaur runs left.</i>

24:45.485 --> 24:47.487
<i>Fouled hard by Scharfenberg.</i>

24:48.155 --> 24:50.240
There you go, Richard!
You sell the crap outta that!

24:50.324 --> 24:53.535
<i>Montlaur earns Richmond a late free kick.</i>

24:53.619 --> 24:55.454
I think he's making a meal of it, Arlo.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.414
<i>City players do too.</i>

24:57.497 --> 25:01.210
<i>No, Chris. He's definitely hurt.
No, no, he's absolutely fine.</i>

25:01.293 --> 25:02.586
Yeah!

25:02.669 --> 25:06.757
Oi! Lasso Special! Lasso Special!

25:06.840 --> 25:08.091
Holy smokes.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.718
Lasso Special!

25:09.801 --> 25:12.137
<i>Manchester City are more worried
about yelling at the official</i>

25:12.221 --> 25:14.932
<i>than they are about...
whatever it is Richmond are doing.</i>

25:15.015 --> 25:16.934
-Hold on, hold on.
-<i>Actually, what are they doing?</i>

25:17.017 --> 25:18.977
Ref! They can't do that!
What are you doing?

25:19.061 --> 25:21.396
They're gonna run it. I didn't even
call it. They're gonna just run it!

25:21.480 --> 25:24.149
<i>I don't know what's going on here,
but it looks like...</i>

25:24.233 --> 25:25.943
<i>Is this American football?</i>

25:26.818 --> 25:28.737
What the fuck is that?

25:29.488 --> 25:30.489
What's he doing?

25:30.572 --> 25:32.574
<i>I've never seen anything like this.</i>

25:33.242 --> 25:34.618
-Motion!
-Get in line!

25:35.452 --> 25:37.454
<i>Obisanya goes in motion.</i>

25:38.789 --> 25:41.667
<i>If Richmond are trying to confuse
Manchester City,</i>

25:41.750 --> 25:44.044
<i>you have to say it's working.</i>

25:44.127 --> 25:46.046
<i>It's working on me too, Arlo.</i>

25:46.129 --> 25:47.130
Blue 48!

25:47.214 --> 25:49.299
<i>Is Zoreaux yelling numbers and colors?</i>

25:49.383 --> 25:50.843
Hut, hut, hut! Hike!

25:50.926 --> 25:53.929
One, two, three, four...

25:54.680 --> 25:58.016
<i>The Richmond players fan out.
City's defense is in chaos.</i>

25:58.100 --> 26:02.521
<i>And it's a Hail Mary to Obisanya,
who is wide open!</i>

26:02.604 --> 26:04.231
<i>Rojas is all alone on the left.</i>

26:04.314 --> 26:05.649
-Dani's onside.
-Yeah, he is.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.490
<i>Rojas!</i>

26:19.413 --> 26:20.539
-Yes!
-Yeah!

26:22.040 --> 26:24.585
<i>The injury time equalizer from Dani Rojas,</i>

26:24.668 --> 26:27.504
<i>surely enough to keep Richmond
in the Premier League!</i>

26:29.590 --> 26:32.593
We got a tie! We got a tie!

26:32.676 --> 26:35.137
-Yeah!
-We're staying in!

26:44.021 --> 26:45.022
Coach!

26:45.105 --> 26:48.150
<i>Straight from the kickoff,
City are back on the attack.</i>

26:48.233 --> 26:51.403
<i>There he is again.
Tartt loses Winchester with ease.</i>

26:51.486 --> 26:53.197
<i>It's only him and the goalkeeper.</i>

26:53.280 --> 26:54.198
No.

26:56.325 --> 26:58.577
<i>Oh, he makes the extra pass.</i>

26:58.660 --> 27:00.412
<i>Hendrick buries it.</i>

27:06.084 --> 27:08.253
<i>Manchester City win,</i>

27:08.337 --> 27:12.633
<i>and AFC Richmond's time
in the Premier League is over.</i>

27:38.575 --> 27:40.619
<i>We can "woulda, coulda, shoulda"
all day long,</i>

27:40.702 --> 27:44.081
<i>but that's-- it's a tough loss.
It's a tough loss.</i>

27:45.374 --> 27:46.625
It's over.

27:46.708 --> 27:50.546
<i>I do wanna congratulate Man City
on their win though, and their coach, Pep.</i>

27:50.629 --> 27:53.340
<i>Boy, did he look sharp tonight.
Yeah, my man...</i>

28:10.482 --> 28:13.527
You! Do you really think I would've come
all the way down to London

28:13.610 --> 28:15.612
to watch my son pass the ball?

28:16.905 --> 28:20.576
You could've scored the winner.
You're better than that, Jamie. Fuck!

28:31.211 --> 28:32.379
So, look, I--

28:33.422 --> 28:35.799
Oh, I'm good. Thank you. Yeah.

28:41.096 --> 28:43.682
Hey. Y'all played
a heck of a game out there.

28:43.765 --> 28:47.352
We may not have won,
but y'all definitely succeeded.

28:47.436 --> 28:50.355
I mean, you gave the champs
90 minutes of hell.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.149
Zoreaux, where you at?

28:52.232 --> 28:54.776
That dude had more saves
than a Baptist preacher.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.904
Give it up for Zoreaux. Yeah.

28:58.280 --> 29:02.451
That's right. What about Roy?
Roy chased down his grandson.

29:02.534 --> 29:05.454
Stopped him from getting an easy one.

29:08.665 --> 29:12.127
Now, look, this is a sad moment
right here. For all of us.

29:12.211 --> 29:14.087
And there ain't nothing I can say,

29:14.171 --> 29:16.965
standing in front of you right now,
that can take that away.

29:17.049 --> 29:18.884
But please do me this favor, will you?

29:20.385 --> 29:22.679
Lift your heads up
and look around this locker room.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.181
Yeah?

29:26.266 --> 29:27.768
Look at everybody else in here.

29:29.603 --> 29:31.313
And I want you to be grateful

29:31.396 --> 29:36.276
that you're going through this sad moment
with all these other folks.

29:37.569 --> 29:40.239
Because I promise you,

29:40.322 --> 29:42.783
there is something worse out there
than being sad,

29:42.866 --> 29:45.202
and that is being alone and being sad.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.540
Ain't nobody in this room alone.

29:52.918 --> 29:56.839
Sam, do you remember
what animal has the shortest memory?

29:57.464 --> 29:58.590
A goldfish.

29:58.674 --> 30:00.676
That's right. It's a goldfish.

30:00.759 --> 30:03.220
Sam, what do you think we should all do

30:03.303 --> 30:07.641
once we get done being sad and/or angry
about this situation?

30:08.809 --> 30:10.519
I think we should all be a goldfish.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.603
I agree.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.815
Let's be sad now. Let's be sad together.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.984
And then we can be a gosh-darn goldfish.

30:19.862 --> 30:21.405
Onward. Forward.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.418
What do you want?

30:39.882 --> 30:40.883
Night, Jamie.

30:43.177 --> 30:44.261
A love letter?

31:16.418 --> 31:18.420
We'll have a conversation about that.

31:19.129 --> 31:20.130
Hey, y'all.

31:20.214 --> 31:22.382
-I'll leave you two to talk.
-Thank you, Leslie.

31:24.092 --> 31:26.178
Leslie? Is that your first name?

31:26.261 --> 31:29.848
It was my mother's name.
I'm what's known as a feminine junior.

31:30.349 --> 31:32.518
Oh. Cool.

31:36.480 --> 31:37.648
Please. Take a seat.

31:42.945 --> 31:43.946
Tea?

31:44.029 --> 31:46.865
No. Tea and I
are still on a lifelong hiatus, yeah.

31:46.949 --> 31:48.784
I'll take a little water though, please.

31:48.867 --> 31:52.162
Well, Ted.
That was certainly a heartbreaking result.

31:52.246 --> 31:53.872
Yes, ma'am.
And I've been thinking about it.

31:53.956 --> 31:57.251
I think it's mighty unfair
that you have to fire me, so...

31:57.334 --> 32:00.671
If it's all the same to you, I'd like
to spare you the trouble and just quit.

32:01.547 --> 32:05.133
This here is my letter of resignation.

32:05.217 --> 32:08.220
I wrote it on the back
of a takeout menu,

32:08.303 --> 32:11.223
but it's in an envelope, and I signed it,
so, you know, it's legit.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.433
You listen to me, Coach Lasso.

32:13.517 --> 32:19.439
You are not going anywhere,
'cause we have work to do next season.

32:23.861 --> 32:25.821
Well, okay. All right, then.

32:26.530 --> 32:28.782
Yeah. So, wait. Tell me this, though.

32:28.866 --> 32:32.077
The teams that get relegated,
they can get un-relegated, yeah?

32:32.160 --> 32:33.579
They can get promoted.

32:33.662 --> 32:35.747
So then, next year
we get ourselves a promotion,

32:35.831 --> 32:37.916
which looks good on any résumé.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.585
Then we come back to this league and...

32:40.627 --> 32:43.255
we do something that
no one believes we could ever do.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.300
Win the whole fucking thing.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.387
There you are.

32:53.891 --> 32:55.058
The bubbles.

32:55.142 --> 32:57.227
I'm sorry. Did I get you?
