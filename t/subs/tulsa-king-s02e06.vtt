17:58.178 --> 17:59.345
Keep your index finger

17:59.346 --> 18:00.479
pointed straight
along the barrel

18:00.480 --> 18:01.947
and off the trigger

18:01.948 --> 18:03.249
- until you're ready to shoot.
- Got it.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.083
Slowly raise up.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.652
Slowly and evenly

18:06.653 --> 18:08.187
pull back on the trig--

18:08.188 --> 18:09.421
- [gasps]
- Jesus.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.223
- Did I hit it?
- No.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.924
- Oh. [laughs]
- But if that was an intruder

18:12.925 --> 18:14.693
you would've scared
the shit out of him.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.128
Hey, that's what I was
going for. It's a warning shot.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.563
Little flesh wound.

18:17.564 --> 18:18.930
- Let's go again.
- Okay.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.400
- There you go.
- Ah!

18:21.401 --> 18:24.170
You just knocked that son of a
bitch right in between his eyes.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.438
That's what I'm talking about
right there.

18:29.041 --> 18:29.975
Armand.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.310
Eva, thank you.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.145
Can I get either of you
anything?

18:33.146 --> 18:34.746
No need.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.548
[Armand clears his throat]

18:36.549 --> 18:38.484
Hey, Cal, thanks for seeing me.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.320
Sure. Please, take a seat.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.091
You must have something good
for me, I trust.

18:46.092 --> 18:47.726
No, not really. I was just...

18:47.727 --> 18:49.595
actually, just hoping maybe
we could talk.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.963
- Talk?
- Yeah, th-this thing

18:51.964 --> 18:55.034
at-at Dwight's wind farm,
up in Galena?

18:56.135 --> 18:57.936
Did you have anything
to do with that?

18:57.937 --> 19:00.472
What thing? I'm-I'm not sure I
know what you're talking about.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.341
That wasn't you?

19:02.342 --> 19:04.176
Some kind of fight or something?

19:04.177 --> 19:05.744
Bunch of Asian guys showed up.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.514
I talked to Bodhi,
he works with Dwight, too,

19:08.515 --> 19:10.182
he was pretty banged up.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.219
I can't imagine I know
what you mean.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.221
Look, I'm not stupid,
all right?

19:15.222 --> 19:16.722
It's one thing for me
to tell you stuff,

19:16.723 --> 19:18.990
but when you use the information
for shit like that,

19:18.991 --> 19:20.392
that's my ass on the line.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.061
You do realize I've given you

19:23.062 --> 19:25.531
almost $50,000 already.

19:25.532 --> 19:28.234
I appreciate it.
More than appreciate it.

19:28.235 --> 19:31.036
And after taxes,
that's more than you make

19:31.037 --> 19:32.704
in a year.

19:32.705 --> 19:36.142
Do you think I did that out of
the goodness of my heart?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.546
I mean, you said you wanted
to help me out.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.282
What are you, a child?

19:44.116 --> 19:47.553
Seriously, are you
that fucking stupid?

19:47.554 --> 19:51.423
Everything in life
is transactional.

19:51.424 --> 19:54.360

19:54.361 --> 19:56.128
Did you really not know that?

20:00.533 --> 20:03.369
Look, I don't
want to do this anymore.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.437
Do this?
Do-do... do what?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.539
Give you information.
Tell you shit.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.740
Dwight's too dangerous.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.942
Huh. You think he's dangerous?

20:10.943 --> 20:12.244
- Look--
- No, no, no, no, no,

20:12.245 --> 20:13.645
no, no, no, no, no.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.214
You look.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.519
I own you.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.489
I have people out there
that will literally

20:23.490 --> 20:26.725
skin you alive as soon as
they'd just look at you.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.829
People for whom
life has less than no value.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.600
If you ever tell me what you
will or won't do again,

20:34.601 --> 20:36.735
I'll have your tongue
ripped out of your throat

20:36.736 --> 20:39.472
and sent to your children.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.175
Am I clear?

20:45.111 --> 20:46.412
Am I?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.847
Yeah.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.750
Don't ever show up here again.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.288
Fuck off.

Excuse me.

21:29.822 --> 21:30.856
[waitress]
How can I help you?

21:30.857 --> 21:33.459
- Do you make milkshakes?
- We do.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.794
- You want one?
- No. Who drinks that shit?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.830

Sorry I'm late.
Fucking Uber.

21:47.774 --> 21:48.975
Where's Chickie?

21:51.344 --> 21:53.745
- He's still at LaGuardia.
- Aw...

21:53.746 --> 21:56.749
- He was detained.
- Why?

21:57.717 --> 22:00.652
He had this pistol
in his ankle holster.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.388
He brought a gun to a sit-down?

22:02.389 --> 22:05.991
No. No, no.
He just forgot he had it.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.025
It happens.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.395
It happens if you're a moron.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.830
See, on that we agree.

22:13.199 --> 22:14.866
So, for the purposes
of this meeting,

22:14.867 --> 22:15.901
you can speak for Chickie?

22:15.902 --> 22:18.003
Absolutely.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.372
Okay, good.
Let's get this going.

22:20.373 --> 22:22.374
Would you like
to hear our specials?

22:22.375 --> 22:24.042
Oh, no, thank you.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.911
Sure. What do you got?

22:25.912 --> 22:28.179
I'm not here to eat.
Know what I mean?

22:28.180 --> 22:30.882
You're not curious
about the local cuisine?

22:30.883 --> 22:31.950
You're interested,
is that right?

22:31.951 --> 22:34.853
Mm-hmm.
What are the specialties?

22:34.854 --> 22:35.854
Yeah, what are they?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.923
Well, we have red beans
and rice,

22:37.924 --> 22:40.392
collard greens,
southern oxtails,

22:40.393 --> 22:42.761
hoppin' Johns, which is
black-eyed peas and rice,

22:42.762 --> 22:44.530
- Mmm.
- candied yams,

22:44.531 --> 22:46.765
pigs' feet and sweet potato pie.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.867
Wow, how about that.
How about we get you

22:48.868 --> 22:50.936
a plate of pigs' feet
for the ride home?

22:50.937 --> 22:52.203
House specialty, yeah?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.872
Good memory.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.708
I think we're good for now, sweetheart.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.477
Okay.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.446
- There you go.
- Thank you.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.148
Let's get this started.

23:03.149 --> 23:05.517
What's on your mind, General?

23:05.518 --> 23:08.153
No, you go first.

23:08.154 --> 23:09.555
It's like I said
the last time we met:

23:09.556 --> 23:11.122
Tulsa belongs to KC.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.290
You got
the history lesson, right?

23:12.291 --> 23:14.292
- I did.
- [Bevilaqua] Good. Yeah.

23:14.293 --> 23:16.294
Point is you're
doing business on my turf,

23:16.295 --> 23:18.163
and you don't want to even

23:18.164 --> 23:20.967
entertain a reasonable offer.
Nothing.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.236
We been here,
protecting, building, fighting

23:25.237 --> 23:26.972
for what's ours
for fucking decades.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.508
And then all of a sudden,
like a bad fucking magic trick,

23:29.509 --> 23:32.310
you drop in
out of the fucking sky.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.212
You got no backing,
you got no crew,

23:34.213 --> 23:36.548
you got nothing.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.416
And you actually
trying to take over

23:38.417 --> 23:40.085
my fucking territory?

23:40.086 --> 23:42.087
No agreements?

23:42.088 --> 23:43.589
And you don't want
to give me anything?

23:43.590 --> 23:45.423
I mean, let me ask you guys
a fucking question.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.225
In what world

23:47.226 --> 23:48.594
is that acceptable?

23:48.595 --> 23:49.795
I want to know.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.863
There's a flaw in your logic.

23:51.864 --> 23:55.033
You assume that I automatically
agree that Tulsa's your turf.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.102
Is there any part of Tulsa

23:57.103 --> 23:59.638
that you have a piece of?
Say, garbage collecting,

23:59.639 --> 24:02.808
construction, trucking? No.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.677
You guys didn't even know
fucking Tulsa existed

24:05.678 --> 24:07.713
until you found out I was here.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.180
But you are there, Dwight.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.482
Yeah, I am here,
and I'm talking to him.

24:10.483 --> 24:12.518
How about outside of Tulsa?

24:12.519 --> 24:14.686
Do you have a piece of that?
Do you have a piece

24:14.687 --> 24:16.955
of the city of Galena
and our turbines?

24:16.956 --> 24:19.858
Do you have a piece
of the Indian proceeds?

24:19.859 --> 24:21.693
We don't fuck with the natives.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.662
And that has no bearing
on this problem.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.430
You are an outsider. Period.

24:25.431 --> 24:27.699
Tulsa's mine.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.167
Is this something
you really want

24:29.168 --> 24:30.468
to fucking battle over, General?

24:30.469 --> 24:32.070
Because you're gonna
fucking lose.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.139
Maybe yes, maybe no.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.342
But I was sent here
against my will

24:37.343 --> 24:38.910
by his boss,

24:38.911 --> 24:41.179
and I had to do
what I had to do to survive.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.148
And I did survive.
I'm still surviving.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.216
But if you're owed a debt,

24:45.217 --> 24:47.052
that's on New York.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.687
It's your obligation.

24:48.688 --> 24:51.189
No, come--
That's bullshit. You owe.

24:51.190 --> 24:53.525
If the envelopes stop,
so does your liability coverage.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.394
Either way, I need some money.

24:56.395 --> 24:58.029
I'm down a man,
a good fucking man.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.364
One that you took out, remember?

24:59.365 --> 25:01.199
Oh, you mean that fucking cretin

25:01.200 --> 25:03.168
that you wanted to whack me--
that guy?

25:03.169 --> 25:05.070
Is that how you picture this?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.138
You broke his neck
and you stabbed his guts out

25:07.139 --> 25:09.074
and you left him
on my fucking driveway.

25:09.075 --> 25:11.143
We went light on him, okay, pal?

25:12.845 --> 25:16.748
I picture you coming
into my joint with an ultimatum,

25:16.749 --> 25:19.818
and then you have this fucking
mook try to blow my brains out.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.186
And for a brief moment,

25:21.187 --> 25:24.122
I actually
entertained the notion

25:24.123 --> 25:25.657
of coming to your house,

25:25.658 --> 25:27.959
setting it on fucking fire
with you in it.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.160
But you know what?
I didn't do it.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.762
I said, "Let it pass."

25:30.763 --> 25:33.164
And here we are,

25:33.165 --> 25:35.334
talking like gentlemen.
Imagine that.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.637
I know that Kansas City deals

25:38.638 --> 25:40.806
in regular rackets
across the board.

25:40.807 --> 25:43.542
Are you guys invested
in, say, growing weed?

25:44.510 --> 25:45.844
Why do you want to know that?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.846
I'm just curious.
Are you involved

25:47.847 --> 25:50.448
in cannabis farming,
say, in Oklahoma?

25:50.449 --> 25:52.651
Not anymore.
It's a pain in my ass.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.653
I left it to the China-billys.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.387
So, you're out?

25:56.388 --> 25:58.890
Or are you growing
someplace else?

25:58.891 --> 26:01.793
Missouri and parts of Texas.
Is this heading somewhere?

26:01.794 --> 26:03.729
I'm just saying that I heard

26:03.730 --> 26:05.931
that Texas is going through
a very bad drought, that's all.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.733
And what are you,
a fucking weatherman now?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.768
Not a weatherman,
but I'm just saying

26:09.769 --> 26:11.603
that for your business,

26:11.604 --> 26:13.772
it must be slowing down
without water.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.707
Hey, don't worry about
the fucking water problem.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.408
- [Vince] Hold on.
- Worry about this problem.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.544
Don't tell me to hold on.
Worry about this problem.

26:19.545 --> 26:21.346
You're in the weed business.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.581
The right thing to do is
you cut us in for a taste of it.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.383
- Yeah.
- [Dwight] Mm-hmm.

26:25.384 --> 26:27.886
How about a week from never?

26:27.887 --> 26:29.487
Is that too soon?

26:29.488 --> 26:32.191
- Ah, perfect timing.
- Here you go.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.559
Sure you don't want one?

26:34.560 --> 26:36.161
That's okay, I'm an adult.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.329
[Dwight] Don't know
what you're missing here.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.366
I left New York to the rats.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.635
Four-legged and otherwise.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.137
I don't owe you
or Chickie nothing,

26:46.138 --> 26:47.605
not a dollar.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.775
You guys owe me.
I spent 25 years

26:49.776 --> 26:52.277
behind the wall for you guys.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.979
And as for Kansas City,

26:53.980 --> 26:55.513
we're neighbors, man.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.315
We can't be
at each other's throats.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.785
So what I'm willing to do
is give you 15%

26:59.786 --> 27:02.487
off the top,
and you provide security
