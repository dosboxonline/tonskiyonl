<font color="#ec14bd"><b>*** Subtitles created by dylux ***</b></font>

01:33.161 --> 01:36.197
<i>Security has been tightened
throughout the country.</i>

01:36.230 --> 01:39.200
<i>All borders have been
placed on full alert.</i>

01:39.233 --> 01:42.703
Exit visas have been
suspended for the entire week.

01:42.736 --> 01:45.539
<i>In addition, we have
received assurances</i>

01:45.573 --> 01:47.908
<i>from our undercover
agents in za West</i>

01:47.941 --> 01:51.412
<i>that our actions to date have
gone completely undetected.</i>

01:52.680 --> 01:55.449
<i>All military leaves
have been canceled</i>

01:55.483 --> 01:58.319
<i>and we have doubled the guard
around Dr. Flammond.</i>

01:58.352 --> 02:01.622
<i>And finally, all systems</i>

02:01.655 --> 02:04.492
<i>are in readiness for deployment
of the Polaris Mine.</i>

02:05.693 --> 02:08.729
Just as you ordered,
General Streck.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.465
Well done, Von Horst.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.402
By Sunday, the entire
NATO submarine fleet

02:14.435 --> 02:17.571
<i>will be here on their maneuvers
and completely vulnerable.</i>

02:19.173 --> 02:21.675
Major Crumpler,

02:21.709 --> 02:24.378
<i>what is the progress of
our diversionary plan?</i>

02:24.412 --> 02:26.547
The schedule for the cultural festival

02:26.580 --> 02:28.582
is now complete, Herr General.

02:28.616 --> 02:32.353
And you should be pleased to note
that at your personal request,

02:32.386 --> 02:35.223
the Soviets have agreed to
send their celebrated tenor,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.624
Vladimir Biletnikov.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.760
Well done, Herr Major.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.762
Then everything has gone
according to the plan.

02:42.796 --> 02:46.166
Well, not exactly, mein General.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.602
The American, Leonard Bernstein,

02:48.636 --> 02:50.904
unfortunately has had to cancel.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.507
<i>But they are sending another
performer in his place.</i>

02:53.541 --> 02:55.209
In fact, we have just received

02:55.243 --> 02:57.945
this copy of his most
recent record album.

02:58.846 --> 03:02.383
His name is... Nick Rivers.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.386
<i>I'm sure he will
be quite adequate.</i>

03:05.419 --> 03:07.388
As long as the attention of the world

03:07.421 --> 03:09.490
is firmly fixed on
our cultural festival,

03:09.523 --> 03:13.227
no one will know
what is about to happen.

03:13.261 --> 03:18.932
And once again, Germany will become
united under one rule. Ours!

03:18.966 --> 03:23.437
After Sunday, there will be
no one to stop us!

A pen.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.011
A pen.

06:21.348 --> 06:22.716
A table.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.021
A table.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.863
The pen is on the table.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.439
There is sauerkraut in my lederhosen.

06:48.876 --> 06:50.043
Come in.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.553
What did he say?

07:00.588 --> 07:02.956
I think we're at
the East German checkpoint.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.958
Better have our passports ready.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.894
Now remember, Nick,
this is the first time

07:06.927 --> 07:09.229
rock music has ever been
allowed in this country.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.231
So, you're not just a performer,
you're an ambassador

07:11.264 --> 07:12.900
representing America.

07:14.334 --> 07:17.571
And above all, remember,
we've got to play by their rules.

07:17.605 --> 07:20.407
Martin, I've been practicing.
How's this?

07:23.977 --> 07:25.178
What does that mean?

07:25.212 --> 07:26.847
"Is your daughter 18?"

07:31.985 --> 07:33.487
Your papers, please.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.295
Mr. Nick Rivers.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.132
We've been awaiting the arrival
of the famous American singer.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.669
<i>Come here!</i>

07:59.412 --> 08:00.881
Where are they taking him?

08:00.914 --> 08:02.550
They are not taking him anywhere.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.257
Do not let your American curiosity

08:10.290 --> 08:12.392
lead you into trouble, Mr. Rivers.

08:12.425 --> 08:17.397
You are a guest here only because
it serves our purposes.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.032
I suggest that during your stay

08:19.066 --> 08:21.735
it would be wise to
keep to your own affairs.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.941
Good day.

08:35.783 --> 08:38.118
- What the hell did you say to him?
- Nothing.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.888
I just told him I put his name on the
Montgomery Ward mailing list.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.860
I'm sorry. He's just a little
tired from the trip.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.229
Normally, he wouldn't have said...

08:51.264 --> 08:54.267
Your attitude is being noted, Mr. Rivers.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.913
If that was your idea
of being an ambassador,

09:05.946 --> 09:08.281
we're headed for
a lot of trouble.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.198
I want a schnauzer
with my Wiener schnitzel.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.734
<i>Souvenirs, novelties, party tricks.</i>

11:43.036 --> 11:47.440
Souvenirs, novelties, party tricks.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.383
Do you know any good
white basketball players?

11:56.416 --> 11:59.452
There are no good white basketball
players, my friend.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.723
There was trouble on
the Berlin Express.

12:03.757 --> 12:06.259
They knew I was on that train.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.963
We suspect there is a traitor
somewhere in the Resistance.

12:11.498 --> 12:14.234
We must proceed, nonetheless.
There is too much at stake.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.938
Here, kind sir, smell this flower.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.808
It never fails to amuse at parties.

12:23.811 --> 12:26.279
That's very good.

12:26.313 --> 12:30.851
The Germans are planning something.
Time is running out.

12:30.884 --> 12:34.287
Have you found out where
Dr. Flammond is being kept?

12:34.321 --> 12:37.925
Here. This is one of
our most popular items.

12:42.095 --> 12:45.866
That's very good.
That's very good, <i>ja.</i>

12:45.899 --> 12:48.435
We do not know where they
are keeping Dr. Flammond,

12:48.468 --> 12:51.671
only that they are forcing him
to build a new weapon.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.374
What are my instructions?

12:54.407 --> 12:57.310
Here, here. Try this.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.113
This will make you very popular
at social gatherings.

13:03.951 --> 13:05.986
Go tonight to the ballet.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.421
Here. Use this ticket.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.390
You will meet the leader
of the Resistance,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.192
a man known as "The Torch."

13:12.225 --> 13:14.561
Until then, wait at the Howard Johnson's.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.197
It's on the corner of <i>Der Fuehrer Strasse</i>
and <i>Goebbels Platzen.</i>

13:17.230 --> 13:20.100
Good luck, kind sir,
and God be with you.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.134
Wait.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.437
You dropped your phony dog poo.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.806
What phony dog poo?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.277
Souvenirs, novelties, party tricks.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.789
Driver, why have we stopped here?

14:16.823 --> 14:18.591
This isn't the Howard Johnson's.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.610
Good evening.
A table for two, please.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.345
The name is Rivers.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.082
Ah, yes, Mr. Rivers.

15:15.115 --> 15:18.818
<i>I have it right here.
But I'm afraid we require</i>

15:18.851 --> 15:21.354
a jacket and tie
for the dining room.

15:21.388 --> 15:24.724
If you like, we would be very
happy to provide you with one.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.193
Oh, that would be fine.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.494
Jurgen.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.531
This way, sir.

15:34.401 --> 15:39.106
Ah, General Streck, Comrade Biletnikov.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.608
I have your table ready for you.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.411
Very good, Heinz.
As you know,

15:44.444 --> 15:47.014
Comrade Biletnikov holds a
very high rank in the party.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.582
We wish to afford him every courtesy.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.718
But of course, mein General.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.354
Perhaps Comrade Biletnikov

15:54.387 --> 15:57.490
would be persuaded to
sing for us this evening.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.526
I will take care of it.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.701
Thank you.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.875
<i>Nick, I'm sorry I won't be able
to join you for dinner tonight.</i>

16:15.908 --> 16:19.279
<i>I'm coming down with a sore throat,
so I've decided to turn in early.</i>

16:19.312 --> 16:21.548
Don't forget. You have to
be at the theater at 8:30.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.285
This doesn't help at all.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.886
Don't worry about it, Martin.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.921
Go up to your room
and get some sleep.

16:28.955 --> 16:31.391
- Is there anything you need?
- No, thanks.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.426
I just wanted to make sure you
got those new arrangements.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.429
Oh, yeah.
I got them right here.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.465
Oh, by the way,

16:38.498 --> 16:41.834
I ordered that '84 Ripple Blanc
for you that they recommended.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.503
- It's very good.
- Thanks.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.903
Who do you favor in the
Virginia Slims tournament?

17:16.935 --> 17:21.007
In women's tennis, I always root
against the heterosexual.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.575
Have you heard from Cedric?

17:22.608 --> 17:23.876
Yes, yes. He was just here.

17:23.910 --> 17:26.679
Wait in your hotel room.
He will meet you there.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.782
This letter has to be
in New York by Tuesday.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.718
Now go.
Quickly.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.533
<i>Search this area.</i>

18:07.754 --> 18:10.123
Excuse me. I am sorry, madam,

18:10.157 --> 18:13.226
but this evening is only for guests
of the cultural festival.

18:17.664 --> 18:19.399
Your Ripple Blanc, sir.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.604
I have explained to you...

18:45.057 --> 18:47.194
Jurgen, escort this lady out.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.434
Excuse me, but this lady's with me.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.504
Ah, Mr. Rivers.
A thousand pardons, madam.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.907
After you, my dear.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.942
You're just in time.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.912
You know, I don't think I've ever
seen you looking so lovely.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.420
Thank you. That was
very kind of you.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.557
My pleasure. I was looking
for someone to dance with.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.091
You're an American.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.127
That's right.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.029
My uncle was born in America.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.297
Oh, really.

19:24.331 --> 19:27.500
But he was one of the lucky ones.

19:27.534 --> 19:31.304
He managed to escape in a balloon
during the Jimmy Carter presidency.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.006
I bet he's got a lot
of great stories.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.242
Yes.

19:36.743 --> 19:40.680
He would tell me about all the
large houses and expensive cars,

19:40.713 --> 19:42.649
and how the young people waste
their time watching television

19:42.682 --> 19:44.384
and listening to Rock 'n' Roll music.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.085
What's wrong with television?

19:46.118 --> 19:50.323
Not all television. <i>M.A.S.H.</i> was okay,
and the old <i>Mary Tyler Moore Show.</i>

19:50.357 --> 19:53.826
It just seems like the young people
of America take freedom for granted.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.463
Now, wait a minute.
I don't think you're being fair.

19:56.496 --> 20:00.267
You know, my history class once spent
an entire week in Philadelphia.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.971
Maybe so. You can talk
about freedom all you want,

20:05.004 --> 20:08.941
but still you don't know what it's
like to have to fight for it.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.099
Perhaps my lecture was unwarranted.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.034
I am grateful for what
you did back there.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.003
Well, you know, I think
you'd really like America.

20:37.036 --> 20:39.306
We've got the Liberty Bell,
Disneyland on both coasts.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.707
It's happening.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.878
I'm sorry. I really
don't know any German.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.981
That's all right. I know a little German.
He's sitting over there.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.738
Anything's fine.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.545
Thank you, um...

21:18.911 --> 21:20.380
Hillary.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.282
Hillary.
That's an unusual name.

21:23.316 --> 21:27.687
It's a German name. It means, 
"she whose bosoms defy gravity."

21:31.358 --> 21:33.760
Pleased to meet you.
My name is Nick.

21:35.027 --> 21:36.896
Nick? What does that mean?

21:38.130 --> 21:40.367
Oh, nothing. My dad thought
of it while he was shaving.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.001
Oh.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.507
Are you in some kind of
trouble with the police?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.811
Some things are much
better left unsaid.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.647
Like what?

21:55.448 --> 21:57.550
Well, you know,

21:57.584 --> 22:00.219
sometimes when you blow
your nose into a tissue

22:00.252 --> 22:02.855
and you put it in your purse,
then a little while later

22:02.889 --> 22:04.891
you have to reach in there
for your lipstick or something

22:04.924 --> 22:06.459
and your hand gushes into it and...

22:06.493 --> 22:08.395
Okay, you're right.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.563
Some things are better left unsaid.

22:14.567 --> 22:16.936
Thank you very much.

22:17.637 --> 22:20.607
Ladies and gentlemen,

22:20.640 --> 22:23.175
<i>we are fortunate to
have with us tonight</i>

22:23.209 --> 22:25.812
<i>a singer whose great talent</i>

22:25.845 --> 22:30.450
<i>is exceeded only by his
devotion to his country.</i>

22:30.483 --> 22:35.054
<i>He truly has the gift of song,
a golden voice,</i>

22:35.087 --> 22:36.989
- <i>inspired talent...</i>
- Is there something wrong?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.458
<i>...and a charming personality.</i>

22:38.491 --> 22:40.927
I was afraid something
like this might happen.

22:40.960 --> 22:45.632
General Streck of the high command
is a most fervent admirer

22:45.665 --> 22:47.867
<i>and owns a complete
set of his works.</i>

22:49.268 --> 22:52.772
<i>Now, he is a very shy
and gentle man,</i>

22:52.805 --> 22:56.075
but perhaps we could
persuade him to sing for us.

22:56.976 --> 22:58.545
<i>Shall we ask him?</i>

23:03.816 --> 23:06.686
I'd better do what they want.
I promised my manager.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.002
Thank you, sir.

23:25.605 --> 23:27.306
Okay, watch the change
in the second chorus.

23:27.339 --> 23:29.476
Oh, my God.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.766
Cedric!

26:18.978 --> 26:21.981
Cedric, what have
they done to you?

26:22.014 --> 26:24.050
It was a trap.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.518
They must have known I was staying
at the Howard Johnson's.

26:26.552 --> 26:28.287
But who did this?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.156
Never mind about that.

26:30.189 --> 26:32.591
We've got to rescue your
father before it's too late.

26:32.625 --> 26:34.661
But what are
we going to do?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.195
I was...

26:38.564 --> 26:41.634
...supposed to go
to the ballet tonight,

26:41.668 --> 26:43.269
meet a man called "The Torch."

26:44.336 --> 26:45.938
Thank you.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.907
He's the leader of the Resistance.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.341
He'll help us find your father.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.243
I'll go.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.378
No, you can't go.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.080
It's too dangerous.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.649
But I must.
He'll be tortured.

26:56.683 --> 26:59.218
All right, but be very
careful at the ballet.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.621
Where is the ticket?

27:02.655 --> 27:04.724
In the glove compartment.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.958
Can you reach it from the inside?

27:09.796 --> 27:11.630
How about the other hand?

27:15.802 --> 27:18.705
Oh, no, that's not it.
Let me try.

27:23.509 --> 27:24.944
Here it is.

29:22.895 --> 29:24.230
We've got to get out of here.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.564
We oughta wait for the police.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.133
That was the police!

29:35.107 --> 29:36.375
In here!

29:45.985 --> 29:48.120
Here. We can get out this way.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.222
Wait a minute. First you
can explain a few things.

29:50.256 --> 29:51.824
I'm not sure I can.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.833
I only know I've put
you in great danger.

30:00.867 --> 30:02.401
Please trust me.
You must come with me!

30:03.469 --> 30:06.005
Look, I don't know what
kind of trouble you're in,

30:06.038 --> 30:08.507
but don't worry about me,
I'm a guest of the government.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.741
I can explain everything.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.343
You're mistaken.
They'll put you...

30:14.113 --> 30:16.883
Go while you still can.
They can't do anything to me.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.709
Martin!

30:43.742 --> 30:45.777
Boy, am I glad to see you.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.346
I've been here 20 minutes already.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.386
Nick, I tried everything.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.356
The Embassy, the German government,
the Consulate.

30:58.324 --> 31:00.292
I even talked to the U.N. ambassador.

31:00.326 --> 31:01.860
It's no use.

31:01.894 --> 31:04.230
I just can't bring
my wife to orgasm.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.001
Gee, that's a shame, Martin.

31:10.136 --> 31:12.004
Well, have you tried one of these?

31:15.441 --> 31:18.577
Wow. Well, thanks.
I'll give it a whirl.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.250
Now listen, Martin. I'm getting a
little worried about this place
424
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,785
I don't think they've ever
even heard of a trial.

31:26.818 --> 31:30.089
All I know is after you left the
cafe last night, I met a girl.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.658
Then, later at the ballet,
she's sitting all alone.

31:32.691 --> 31:35.161
Then all of a sudden, I see a guy
who has a gun at her head,

31:35.194 --> 31:37.363
and he's looking like
he's gonna kill her.

31:37.396 --> 31:40.032
And he might have
if I hadn't stepped in.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.800
There's gotta be
someone you can call

31:41.833 --> 31:44.570
that can straighten
this mess out.

31:44.603 --> 31:48.407
I figure they gotta let you out
for your concert Friday night.

31:48.440 --> 31:51.643
They're beaming it live by
satellite to 85 countries.

31:51.677 --> 31:55.114
Now, you just relax. And remember,
there's nothing to worry about.

32:41.360 --> 32:43.062
<i>Amen.</i>

32:52.104 --> 32:54.673
We wish to impress
upon you, Mr. Rivers,

32:54.706 --> 32:58.210
that we have methods of dealing with
those who will not cooperate.

32:58.244 --> 33:03.015
Now for the last time, why did
you attack Sergeant Kruger?

33:03.049 --> 33:06.252
I didn't know who it was.
I just saw him pull a gun on a girl.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.420
Might I remind you, Mr. Rivers,

33:08.454 --> 33:12.258
that the penalty for murder
is death by firing squad.

33:12.291 --> 33:15.427
Let us hope for your sake
that Sgt. Kruger survives.

33:18.297 --> 33:19.298
<i>Ja.</i>

33:20.499 --> 33:22.468
It is the hospital, mein General.

33:24.536 --> 33:27.039
What is the condition of Sgt. Kruger?

33:27.406 --> 33:30.242
Yes. I see.

33:30.276 --> 33:33.445
Well, let me know if there's
any change in his condition.

33:34.846 --> 33:35.747
He's dead.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.589
I'm afraid you leave me
no alternative but to introduce you

33:43.622 --> 33:45.124
to two of my associates.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.327
Bruno is almost blind,

33:48.360 --> 33:50.329
has to operate wholly by touch.

33:51.997 --> 33:56.102
Klaus is a moron who knows only what
he reads in <i>The New York Post.</i>

33:56.135 --> 33:59.071
I believe they never let
a man lose consciousness,

33:59.105 --> 34:01.607
however long they
may work upon him.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.642
You don't scare me.

34:03.675 --> 34:06.378
My manager is on his way right
now to the American consulate.

34:07.213 --> 34:09.947
Do not be so sure, Mr. Rivers.

34:09.981 --> 34:12.751
Evidently, your friend did not realize
that here in East Germany,

34:12.784 --> 34:15.454
we use 220-volt current.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.889
He was found in his hotel room

34:17.922 --> 34:20.192
impaled upon a large
electrical device.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.828
<i>Our surgeons did what they could,</i>

34:22.860 --> 34:26.331
<i>but it took them two hours just
to get the smile off his face.</i>

34:30.168 --> 34:33.139
Perhaps the American
has chosen to reconsider.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.152
Make sure they leave no marks.

35:11.577 --> 35:15.214
Do you know which room the
final chemistry exam is in?

35:15.247 --> 35:18.450
All the exams are over.
Haven't you been to class?

35:18.484 --> 35:21.052
- No!
- But it's the end of the semester.

35:21.086 --> 35:24.323
No. No, I haven't studied.

35:24.356 --> 35:27.426
Oh, no, I'm back in school.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.861
I can't believe
I'm back in school.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.267
Thank God.

35:40.739 --> 35:42.007
Well?

35:42.040 --> 35:43.709
They're still working on him.

35:43.742 --> 35:46.445
He won't break.
They've tried everything.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.882
Do you want me to bring out
the LeRoy Neiman paintings?

35:50.916 --> 35:54.653
No. We cannot risk violating
the Geneva Convention.

35:56.922 --> 35:57.923
We'll break him tomorrow.

37:16.234 --> 37:18.804
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

37:18.837 --> 37:21.006
My name is Nick Rivers.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.841
Who are you?

37:22.874 --> 37:25.511
I am Dr. Paul Flammond.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.814
I am a prisoner here
just like you, my son.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.651
You see, a year ago,
I was close to perfecting

37:32.684 --> 37:36.388
the first magnetic
desalinization process.

37:36.422 --> 37:39.991
So revolutionary, it was
capable of removing the salt

37:40.025 --> 37:44.162
from over 500 million gallons
of seawater a day.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.231
Do you realize what
that could mean

37:46.264 --> 37:48.734
to the starving nations
of the earth?

37:48.767 --> 37:51.870
Wow. They'd have enough salt
to last forever.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.808
Then one night, the secret
police broke into my house,

37:56.842 --> 37:59.745
tore me from my family,
ransacked my laboratory,

37:59.778 --> 38:02.848
and brought me to this dungeon.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.683
That sucks.

38:04.716 --> 38:08.219
For the first time in my life

38:08.253 --> 38:10.856
I am ashamed of being a scientist.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.691
What do you mean?

38:12.724 --> 38:15.961
They are forcing me to
create a horrible weapon.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.729
Can't you refuse?

38:17.763 --> 38:22.634
I wish I could, but they
are holding my daughter.

38:22.668 --> 38:27.238
They'll kill her unless I complete
the Polaris Mine by Sunday.

38:27.272 --> 38:30.442
Sunday?
That's Simchas Torah.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.679
And the day the entire
NATO submarine fleet

38:33.712 --> 38:35.914
passes through the
Straits of Gibraltar.

38:37.015 --> 38:38.850
Is this the Polaris Mine?

38:38.884 --> 38:43.489
Yes. By Sunday, I will be able
to arm it with a nuclear warhead.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.190
How does it work?

38:45.223 --> 38:47.192
It is a magnetic mine.

38:47.225 --> 38:51.229
So powerful, it will attract itself
to submarines miles away.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.031
How about that.

38:53.064 --> 38:54.500
Oh, no!

39:03.942 --> 39:05.977
You must go now. If they
find out you've seen this,

39:06.011 --> 39:08.246
your life will be worth less
than a load of dead rats

39:08.279 --> 39:09.681
in a tampon factory.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.091
Right away!

39:21.259 --> 39:22.561
Von Horst.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.029
Ja, mein General.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.498
The government wishes to avoid
an international incident.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.534
Mr. Rivers must be allowed to
perform his concert tonight.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.102
He's to be executed
this very minute.

39:32.404 --> 39:34.039
It'll have to wait.
Call them at once.

39:35.006 --> 39:36.708
<i>Ja,</i> mein General.

40:04.302 --> 40:07.405
<i>♪ How silly can you get?
Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

40:07.439 --> 40:11.076
<i>♪ How silly can you get?

Oh, honey lamb, I'm afraid.

43:21.232 --> 43:24.636
Don't you understand
I'm losing my very mind?

43:24.670 --> 43:26.705
I gotta have you with me.

43:26.738 --> 43:29.675
I'm in such a complete
anguish without you.

43:29.708 --> 43:31.943
Oh, sugar drawers.

43:33.411 --> 43:36.815

Search the road again.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.916
They're in the eastern sector.

44:44.950 --> 44:47.052
I want the whole
area sealed off.

45:04.202 --> 45:07.605
Now, there's a used book store
somewhere around here.

45:07.638 --> 45:09.374
The owner is a member
of the Resistance.

45:09.407 --> 45:12.443
- If we can find him...
- Resistance? Wait a minute.

45:14.612 --> 45:16.982
Don't you think it's about time you
told me what this is all about?

45:18.483 --> 45:21.753
I'm sorry. I guess I do
owe you an explanation.

45:22.687 --> 45:25.623
You see, only a year ago

45:25.656 --> 45:27.525
I was teaching a course
in Black History

45:27.558 --> 45:29.194
at the University of Blaupunkt.

45:29.227 --> 45:31.997
And then one night,
I came home to find

45:32.030 --> 45:35.066
that my father had been arrested
by the Secret Police.

45:36.201 --> 45:38.770
I've been trying to
find him ever since.

45:40.205 --> 45:42.941
Wait a minute.
That's Dr. Flammond.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.876
I saw him yesterday
in Flurgendorf Prison.

45:44.910 --> 45:47.813
Flurgendorf Prison?
Is he all right?

45:48.379 --> 45:49.647
Yes, he looks fine.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.382
Thank God he's safe.

45:51.416 --> 45:53.318
We must get this information
to the Resistance.

45:53.351 --> 45:54.820
Maybe they can help us.

45:54.853 --> 45:56.387
Okay, let's go.

46:36.828 --> 46:38.196
There it is.

46:40.331 --> 46:42.100
It's a Swedish bookstore.

48:20.498 --> 48:23.901
<i>That's okay.
Don't feel bad.</i>

48:23.935 --> 48:26.972
<i>It happens to lots of men
the first time.</i>

48:27.005 --> 48:29.507
<i>Just relax.
I'll pour you a drink.</i>

48:29.540 --> 48:32.543
<i>We can always try again
in a couple of hours.</i>

48:32.577 --> 48:35.981
"She said, as she laid down beside
him and caressed his chest."

48:37.882 --> 48:39.817
Can you believe
they print this trash?

48:39.850 --> 48:41.286
Don't worry about it.

48:41.319 --> 48:43.288
You were going to tell me something
about your childhood.

48:43.588 --> 48:45.690
Oh, yes.

48:45.723 --> 48:48.359
When I was just a young girl,

48:48.393 --> 48:51.529
my uncle took me on
a tropical cruise.

48:51.562 --> 48:55.967
But there was a terrible
storm, and the boat sank.

48:56.001 --> 48:58.203
I managed to swim
to a deserted island

48:58.236 --> 49:00.871
with a young boy named Nigel.

49:00.905 --> 49:03.008
Together, we had to learn to survive.

49:06.444 --> 49:09.114
<i>Fortunately, the
ocean provided its bounty</i>

49:09.147 --> 49:11.949
<i>which Nigel would catch every day.</i>

49:11.983 --> 49:15.020
<i>Later, I would forage inland
for fruit and vegetables</i>

49:15.053 --> 49:17.188
<i>from the endless
varieties of trees</i>

49:17.222 --> 49:19.890
<i>and bushes found
all over the island.</i>

49:19.924 --> 49:22.560
<i>Then we busied ourselves,
chopping palm fronds</i>

49:22.593 --> 49:26.097
<i>and lacing them to bamboo
with dried seaweed and snot.</i>

49:26.131 --> 49:29.700
<i>This not only provided us with
a safe haven from the rain</i>

49:29.734 --> 49:32.670
<i>but sheltered us from the
relentless Santa Ana winds,</i>

49:32.703 --> 49:36.107
<i>which would periodically
ravage the island.</i>

49:36.141 --> 49:38.743
<i>The years passed,
and as we grew up</i>

49:38.776 --> 49:43.214
<i>we began to notice strange,
new feelings awakening within us.</i>

49:43.248 --> 49:45.816
<i>There was no one around
to explain this.</i>

49:45.850 --> 49:47.985
<i>We had to learn by ourselves.</i>

50:18.349 --> 50:21.219
<i>Then one day, he went fishing.</i>

50:21.252 --> 50:23.554
<i>That was the last
I ever saw of Nigel.</i>

50:25.123 --> 50:28.226
<i>I spent months by myself
on that island</i>

50:28.259 --> 50:31.429
until I was finally rescued
by a passing ship.

50:31.462 --> 50:34.865
I'll never forget
my feeling of relief.

50:34.899 --> 50:36.401
You can't imagine what it's like

50:36.434 --> 50:37.968
to be separated from your family

50:38.002 --> 50:39.637
at such a young age.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.108
I think I can.

50:44.542 --> 50:48.313
You see, when I was
about six years old,

50:48.346 --> 50:51.149
my mama took me on
a trip to the city.

50:51.182 --> 50:54.419
We went to one of those
big old department stores...

50:54.452 --> 50:55.686
and I got lost.

50:57.288 --> 51:00.658
They tried to page her, but
the P.A. system was on the fritz.

51:02.693 --> 51:04.529
I never saw my mama again.

51:06.497 --> 51:08.566
<i>Some people from 
the cosmetics department</i>

51:08.599 --> 51:10.735
fed me a bowl of soup
and some bread.

51:10.768 --> 51:13.304
Days stretched into weeks.

51:13.338 --> 51:15.440
One February, they got
pretty jammed up

51:15.473 --> 51:18.343
during the semiannual
Lincoln's Birthday sale,

51:18.376 --> 51:20.778
and they asked me to help
out in Preteen Maternity.

51:22.647 --> 51:25.850
Then one day I overheard
a conversation in Personnel

51:25.883 --> 51:29.320
about them needing a new
jingle for their radio ad.

51:29.354 --> 51:33.057
So, I picked up my guitar
and I wrote down a tune

51:33.090 --> 51:37.195
that had been mullin' and creepin'
and crawlin' around in my head.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.230
It went something like this...

51:49.974 --> 51:54.111

53:40.318 --> 53:41.919
All right, this is it.

53:43.254 --> 53:44.955

53:46.791 --> 53:48.025

53:51.362 --> 53:52.897
<i>Is he all right?</i>

53:52.930 --> 53:54.899

53:54.932 --> 53:58.669

Yes. I am Albert Potato.
Who are you?

54:18.589 --> 54:20.525
We were sent by Sven Jorgensen.

54:25.730 --> 54:26.897
Come this way.

54:54.359 --> 54:55.926
What do you want?

54:56.894 --> 54:58.463
We want to see "The Torch."

54:58.496 --> 55:01.532
No one is allowed to see The Torch.

55:01.566 --> 55:03.300
But we have important information

55:03.334 --> 55:05.503
about my father, Dr. Paul Flammond.

55:06.937 --> 55:08.072
We shall see.

55:22.753 --> 55:24.355
Nigel!

55:24.389 --> 55:25.623
<i>Hillary!</i>

55:33.097 --> 55:34.999
It is you.

55:35.032 --> 55:39.269
Oh, my darling Hillary, if only you knew
how I've yearned for this day to come.

55:39.303 --> 55:42.373
Sleepless nights, lonely hours,

55:42.407 --> 55:44.909
hoping, praying that once more

55:44.942 --> 55:48.479
I would be able to gaze into
your ravishing brown eyes.

55:48.513 --> 55:50.247
And who is this I should thank
for bringing you back to me?

55:50.280 --> 55:52.583
Oh, Nigel, this is Nick.

55:52.617 --> 55:54.885
Nick Rivers.
He is a friend.

55:54.919 --> 55:59.056
Forgive us, Mr. Rivers, if we have
been less than hospitable,

55:59.089 --> 56:01.992
but recently we've had reason to
believe that there is a traitor

56:02.026 --> 56:03.828
somewhere in the Resistance.

56:04.995 --> 56:08.699
Du Quois, introduce
the American to the men.

56:09.166 --> 56:11.268
Very well.

56:11.301 --> 56:14.605
This is Chevalier,

56:14.639 --> 56:16.941
<i>Montage,</i>

56:16.974 --> 56:19.076
<i>Detente,</i>

56:19.109 --> 56:21.045
<i>Avant-garde,</i>

56:21.078 --> 56:23.648
<i>and Deja Vu.</i>

56:23.681 --> 56:25.816
Have we not met before, monsieur?

56:27.184 --> 56:28.586
I don't think so.

56:33.658 --> 56:36.461
Over there, Croissant,

56:37.261 --> 56:39.630
<i>Souffle, Escargot,</i>

56:41.098 --> 56:42.366
<i>and Chocolate Mousse.</i>

56:48.839 --> 56:52.743
Now, Mr. Rivers, what is
the news that you bring us?

56:52.777 --> 56:55.513
I've seen Dr. Flammond
in Flurgendorf Prison.

56:55.546 --> 56:56.614
Flurgendorf prison?

56:56.647 --> 56:57.815
He told me the Polaris Mine

56:57.848 --> 56:59.149
will be ready on Sunday.

56:59.183 --> 57:00.451
Sunday?

57:02.953 --> 57:05.289
We'll have to move out tonight.

57:05.322 --> 57:07.658
I'll be back in a moment, my darling.

57:07.692 --> 57:10.194
- Prepare the gear for the jump.
- <i>Arc de Triomphe!</i>

57:10.227 --> 57:11.562
Cordon bleu.

57:11.596 --> 57:13.598
Nick, I want to explain.

57:13.631 --> 57:15.800
- What's there to explain?
- Look, I just want to say that...

57:15.801 --> 57:18.769
Look! I'm not the first guy who fell
in love with a girl he met in a restaurant

57:18.803 --> 57:20.838
who turned out to be the daughter
of a kidnapped scientist,

57:20.871 --> 57:22.372
only to lose her
to a childhood lover

57:22.406 --> 57:24.108
who she'd last seen on
a deserted island

57:24.141 --> 57:27.612
and turned out 15 years later to be
leader of the French underground.

57:27.645 --> 57:31.048
I know. It... It all sounds
like some bad movie.

57:38.956 --> 57:41.091
Forget it.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.595
It'll be better for everyone
if we forget what's happened.

57:44.629 --> 57:46.764
Mr. Rivers, we've arranged
for your safe transportation

57:46.797 --> 57:48.666
across the border tonight.

57:48.699 --> 57:51.068
It's the least we can do
to show our gratitude.

57:52.102 --> 57:53.938
Come, my darling.

57:53.971 --> 57:56.674
Let me show you what I've done
to the fallout shelter.

58:20.631 --> 58:23.067
Do not take it so hard, Nick.

58:23.100 --> 58:26.370
Life is filled with
its little miseries.

58:26.403 --> 58:30.274
Each of us, in his own way,
must learn to deal with adversity

58:30.307 --> 58:33.110
in a mature and adult fashion.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.355
Mind if I have a swig of this?

58:45.389 --> 58:46.724
Go right ahead.

58:49.560 --> 58:50.527
What the hell is this stuff?

58:50.561 --> 58:51.629
Gasoline.

58:56.266 --> 58:59.804
Don't worry, my darling. I'm sure
your friend will get over it.

58:59.837 --> 59:01.672
He seems a good chap, really.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.643
But, Hillary, how wonderful
you've returned to me now,

59:05.676 --> 59:08.545
when I so desperately need you by
my side to fight for the cause.

59:08.579 --> 59:09.847
Our cause.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.750
Oh, Nigel, I am proud of you.

59:12.783 --> 59:15.485
But I'm so confused.

59:15.519 --> 59:18.022
All these years I thought
you were dead.

59:18.055 --> 59:20.157
And by all rights,
I should be.

59:20.190 --> 59:23.060
I floated at sea for days
nearly unconscious.

59:23.093 --> 59:25.830
As luck would have it, I was
picked up by a passing freighter.

59:25.863 --> 59:28.966
Of course, I tried to get them
to come back to save you too,

59:28.999 --> 59:32.236
but it was a foreign ship and
they didn't understand English.

59:32.269 --> 59:35.773
I yelled and screamed, but it only
seemed to excite them all the more.

59:37.775 --> 59:40.978
They took advantage of me in
ways that I cannot describe.

59:41.011 --> 59:44.682
Oh, Nigel.
It must have been awful!

59:52.156 --> 59:53.624
Latrine!

59:57.662 --> 59:59.229
What did you find out, Latrine?

59:59.263 --> 01:00:00.430
Where are the others?

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.332
Oh, we never had a chance.

01:00:03.367 --> 01:00:05.703
It was a slaughter.

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:08.673
We must put a stop to these
afternoon football games.

01:00:08.706 --> 01:00:10.540
Which direction were
they coming from?

01:00:10.574 --> 01:00:11.809
Up the road.

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:15.179
Take cover!

01:00:15.212 --> 01:00:17.247
Oh, my God.
They're gonna kill us all.

01:00:30.728 --> 01:00:32.196
Here, take this.

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:40.230
Grenade!

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:53.410
We're running out of time.

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.079
The plane will not wait for us.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.147
We'll have to make
a break for it.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.549
Rendezvous at the cafe
near the landing field.

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:00.918
Wait.

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.070
Nice shooting.

01:02:20.637 --> 01:02:22.439
My man!

01:02:46.997 --> 01:02:49.900
Good, you've made it.
Now everybody's accounted for.

01:02:49.934 --> 01:02:52.970
Here's the plan. We'll be
taking off at 0100 hours.

01:02:53.003 --> 01:02:55.505
What about the American?

01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:58.675
A truck will drive by here
at exactly midnight.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.411
You will jump on the back
and be driven to the border.

01:03:01.445 --> 01:03:04.949
Wait. Nick is the only one who
knows the inside of that prison.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.754
Well, Monsieur Rivers,

01:03:10.787 --> 01:03:12.823
it seems that you have become,

01:03:12.857 --> 01:03:15.525
how do you say, "indispensable"?

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:17.394
Indispensable.

01:03:18.963 --> 01:03:21.565
That's what I thought.

01:03:21.598 --> 01:03:25.469
Sorry, fellas. I've done my
time in Flurgendorf Prison.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:26.570
I got a truck to meet.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:34.411
Nick, you can ask any price you want,
but you must help us.

01:03:35.946 --> 01:03:37.915
Seems as long as I know my way
around that prison,

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.583
I'll never be lonely.

01:03:39.616 --> 01:03:41.751
Nick, I know how
you feel about me,

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:43.653
but I'm asking you to
put your feelings aside

01:03:43.687 --> 01:03:44.955
for something more important.

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:46.356
Do I have to hear again

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.824
what a great cause you
and Nigel are fighting for?

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.659
But this was your cause, too.

01:03:49.693 --> 01:03:51.628
My only cause is my music.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.864
That's exactly what I mean.

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:55.565
Didn't you see the eyes of
those kids at your concert?

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:59.069
Oh, Nick, you must help us.

01:03:59.103 --> 01:04:01.205
If not for me,
for the cause of freedom.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:05.309
Latrine!

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.013
A traitor in our midst.

01:04:09.046 --> 01:04:10.847
Well done, Latrine.

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.550
I see you have dealt
with him appropriately.

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.485
Not the bird, you fool!

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.855
This is a carrier pigeon
on its way to German headquarters.

01:04:18.889 --> 01:04:21.458
Look. A message.

01:04:22.726 --> 01:04:25.595
"Resistance planning to free Flammond

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:28.198
"Sunday, 0800 hours."

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:31.936
That means the traitor
is someone at this table.

01:04:39.343 --> 01:04:42.146
Excuse me, but aren't
you Nick Rivers,

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:44.081
the American Rock 'n' Roll star?

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:48.185
No, I'm not.

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:51.421
<i>But you must be. Won't you
sing us just one song?</i>

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:54.358
I'm sorry. You must have me
confused with somebody else.

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.893
I'm Mel Torme.

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:04.234
That was close.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.636
Perhaps a bit too close.

01:05:07.437 --> 01:05:08.805
What do you mean?

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.208
We have absolutely no proof that
this man is who he claims to be.

01:05:12.876 --> 01:05:14.411
And yet we're asking him to lead us

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.546
into the most heavily
guarded prison in Germany.

01:05:16.580 --> 01:05:18.482
Why, Nigel, that's absurd.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.650
Just a moment, my darling.

01:05:20.684 --> 01:05:23.053
We know he came to us
with no credentials.

01:05:23.087 --> 01:05:25.389
We know the Germans never knew
the location of our headquarters

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:27.524
until he arrived.

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.060
And we know that we've been
infiltrated by a traitor.

01:05:30.094 --> 01:05:32.362
Nigel, what are you saying?

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:37.267
How do we know he's not Mel Torme?

01:05:49.713 --> 01:05:51.715
Eva, look.
He's at the jukebox.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:53.517

This is not Mel Torme.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:28.738
Oh, Nick.

01:08:31.808 --> 01:08:32.841
Yes?

01:08:34.211 --> 01:08:37.214
We don't know what's going
to happen down there.

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.383
This may be the last time
I'll see you

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:41.951
and there's something
I wanted to say.

01:08:41.984 --> 01:08:42.986
You don't have to say anything.

01:08:43.019 --> 01:08:44.854
But I want to.

01:08:44.888 --> 01:08:47.256
You must know that when we
were together last night

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:49.959
I had no idea that
Nigel was still alive.

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:52.261
And now that you know?

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:57.167
Nick, his work is
so important to him.

01:08:57.201 --> 01:08:59.403
I must stay with him.

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.337
He pleaded with me
not to leave.

01:09:02.906 --> 01:09:05.742
I just hope you realize
that's all he means to me.

01:09:08.212 --> 01:09:10.346
Oh, I don't know what's
right any longer.

01:09:15.685 --> 01:09:17.921
I only wish I didn't
love you so much!

01:10:05.134 --> 01:10:08.538
I've spotted the herd.
They're the key to the whole plan.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:12.476
Now, we're here.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:18.348
Every morning at 7:15,
the prison guards bring the cows

01:10:18.382 --> 01:10:21.050
from here, up this road
towards the prison

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.320
for their morning milking.

01:10:23.353 --> 01:10:26.222
Du Quois and I will merge
with the herd here,

01:10:27.957 --> 01:10:32.228
and sneak in through the gate
and the electrified fence.

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.364
Then we'll break away
from the other cows

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.900
and enter the generator
building here.

01:10:38.134 --> 01:10:39.836
At exactly 7:25

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:43.072
we cut the power.

01:10:43.106 --> 01:10:45.675
Then the rest of you
come through here,

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:49.579
scale this wall, and Nick can
lead you to Flammond's cell.

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:52.616
Meanwhile, Hillary will steal
this truck by the railway crossing

01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:54.518
and pick us up back here.

01:10:54.551 --> 01:10:57.521
Then we'll drive to the landing field
and the waiting plane.

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.455
Let's go.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:14.604
No, you take the head.
I'm taking the back.

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:17.140
- But the plan was...
- Forget the plan.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.344
I'm giving the orders here.
Now shut up and give me the back half.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:22.846
All right.
Be an asshole.

01:11:34.057 --> 01:11:35.091
<i>Here they come.</i>

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.893
Okay, let's move out.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.902
All right, let's go.
Double time.

01:11:55.645 --> 01:11:57.881
<i>We only have five minutes
to get to the circuit box</i>

01:11:57.914 --> 01:11:59.616
<i>and throw the switch.</i>

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.752
We've got to hurry.
Can you see the gate?

01:12:02.786 --> 01:12:05.622
- <i>Yes. It's just ahead.
- Where are the guards?</i>

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.957
I can only see one.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:10.660
- Ow!
- <i>Ja, there, girl! Move along!</i>

01:12:19.369 --> 01:12:21.004
<i>Stay behind the guards.</i>

01:12:22.406 --> 01:12:23.707
<i>Once we get around this corner,</i>

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:25.642
<i>we'll break away
from the herd.</i>

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.776
<i>Okay, now!</i>

01:12:29.813 --> 01:12:31.381
<i>I think we did it.</i>

01:12:35.385 --> 01:12:36.653
<i>Can you see the generator?</i>

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:39.956
<i>Yes, it's over there
behind the feed bin.</i>

01:12:39.989 --> 01:12:42.225
<i>All right, let's go.
But we've got to hurry.</i>

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:44.861
<i>Mon dieu!</i>

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.670
<i>Nigel?
You okay?</i>

01:12:55.171 --> 01:12:56.873
- <i>Oh, yeah.
- Let's go!</i>

01:12:58.174 --> 01:12:59.943
What's the hurry?

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:01.845
Why are we always in
such a bloody rush?

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:05.915
<i>I just wanted to
stop to take a... rest.</i>

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:15.525
Shh!

01:13:24.534 --> 01:13:26.570
The guards have passed.

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:29.072
All right. How long
till they cut the power?

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:30.907
Three more minutes

01:13:31.641 --> 01:13:33.610
and we can cut the wire.

01:13:58.201 --> 01:13:59.435
<i>There it is.</i>

01:14:49.452 --> 01:14:50.554
Lovely.

01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:08.137
<i>You're all right now.
I'm here.</i>

01:15:09.305 --> 01:15:10.974
<i>Yeah, it's all right.</i>

01:15:13.743 --> 01:15:14.744
Ow!

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:18.848
Hey.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.535
Here, here.

01:15:46.976 --> 01:15:48.044
<i>Viva la France!</i>

01:16:03.693 --> 01:16:05.228
<i>Nigel, what are you doing?</i>

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:06.663
<i>Never you mind.</i>

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:08.765
<i>Why do you want to go
back to the meter shed?</i>

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:11.034
<i>We're going to turn
the power back on.</i>

01:16:11.067 --> 01:16:13.502
<i>But that will set off the alarm.
The others will be trapped.</i>

01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:14.804
<i>I refuse.</i>

01:16:14.838 --> 01:16:16.339
Oh?

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:18.908
This gun in your back says you won't.

01:16:18.942 --> 01:16:20.043
Now, move!

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:24.180
<i>So, it is</i> you
<i>who is a traitor.</i>

01:16:42.031 --> 01:16:43.833
<i>Don't take it too badly, old boy.</i>

01:16:43.867 --> 01:16:45.802
<i>You're no more of a fool
than the others.</i>

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:47.070
<i>Now, get over there
and pull that...</i>

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:48.337
Ohhhhh!

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:55.344
Dr. Flammond!

01:16:56.713 --> 01:16:58.614
- Nick!
- Come on, we're taking you out of here.

01:16:58.648 --> 01:17:00.416
But my daughter.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.185
Don't worry, Hillary's safe.
She's with us.

01:17:02.218 --> 01:17:04.387
Thank God.

01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:08.224
But how ironic. Another day and
I would have completed my tunnel.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:17.834
Nice work.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.860
Nigel!

01:17:43.893 --> 01:17:46.129
- Very clever, my darling.
- Nigel!

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:48.798
You seem to have put the
pieces together very nicely,

01:17:48.832 --> 01:17:50.566
but unfortunately
it's too late for you

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.235
<i>and the others.</i>

01:17:52.268 --> 01:17:54.337
But, Nigel, how could you?

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:56.339
Oh, it wasn't very difficult.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:59.275
I suppose I could have returned to
rescue you from that wretched island,

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.978
but it would have meant
leaving my newfound comrades.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:03.880
Comrades?

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:09.185
Yes. It was a Russian ship.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:12.756
They taught me all about you,
imperialist swine.

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:15.124
I was exposed to the works
of great thinkers.

01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:19.162
Karl Marx, Lenin, L. Ron Hubbard,
Freddie Laker.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:21.697
Now, get into the truck.
We're going for a ride.

01:18:48.191 --> 01:18:50.426
- Something is wrong. Where's the truck?
- Where's Hillary?

01:18:50.459 --> 01:18:52.061
- I'm hungry.
- Du Quois!

01:18:59.735 --> 01:19:00.937
What happened?

01:19:03.072 --> 01:19:06.976
Nigel made me go
back to the meter shed,

01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:10.679
ordered me to set off the alarm.

01:19:10.713 --> 01:19:12.415
And what does he
want us to do now?

01:19:14.183 --> 01:19:16.853
Nothing, you numbskull.
Nigel's a traitor!

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:46.349
Latrine!

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.052
What happened?

01:19:49.085 --> 01:19:51.420
Nigel took Hillary in truck.

01:19:51.821 --> 01:19:53.322
That way.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:56.559
I cannot leave the country
without my daughter.

01:19:56.592 --> 01:19:59.362
I'm going after them.
I'll meet you at the landing field.

01:19:59.765 --> 01:20:03.799
Nick, whether you make it back or not,
that plane must take off

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:06.202
with Dr. Flammond at 1800 hours.

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:09.072
We recommend you be there at least
45 minutes before departure,

01:20:09.105 --> 01:20:10.974
especially at this time of year.

01:20:11.774 --> 01:20:13.209
Good luck, Nick.

01:20:13.776 --> 01:20:14.878
Let's go.

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:16.412
Good luck.

01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:27.023
<i>You've got to hand it to the Germans.</i>

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:28.691
<i>They make great cars.</i>

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:00.009
Goodbye.

01:23:32.007 --> 01:23:34.143
There's no more time.
We've got to take off now.

01:23:34.177 --> 01:23:36.679
I will not leave
without my daughter.

01:23:36.712 --> 01:23:38.714
Listen, old chap.
In a few minutes, it'll be dawn.

01:23:38.747 --> 01:23:40.916
Then we'll be sitting ducks
to their antiaircraft guns.

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.818
<i>Wait.</i>

01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:44.620
<i>There they are!</i>

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:53.196
Oh, Father, thank God you're safe!

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:56.232
My darling. How I feared
I would never see you again.

01:23:56.265 --> 01:23:59.235
<i>I am so proud of you,
my beloved.</i>

01:23:59.268 --> 01:24:02.238
Please. There'll be time to talk
on the plane. You'd better hurry.

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:04.073
But I can't go on that plane.

01:24:04.107 --> 01:24:05.474
But, Hillary.

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:08.244
<i>No, Father.
I'm needed here.</i>

01:24:08.277 --> 01:24:10.579
For as long as a single man
is forced to cower

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:12.948
under the iron fist
of oppression,

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:15.050
as long as a child
cries out in the night

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:17.253
or an actor can be
elected President,

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:19.088
we must continue the struggle.

01:24:19.122 --> 01:24:21.124
No, Hillary.

01:24:21.157 --> 01:24:24.026
It is much too dangerous
for you in Germany now.

01:24:24.059 --> 01:24:27.196
Yes. Go with Nick.
Don't worry about us.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:30.032
We will hear his music
on the <i>Voice of America.</i>

01:24:30.065 --> 01:24:31.900
We will hear it in
the hearts of the people

01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:34.370
and in elevators everywhere.

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.173
And as long as we do,
we know that we are not alone

01:24:37.206 --> 01:24:38.841
in our fight.

01:24:38.874 --> 01:24:40.909
They're right, Hillary.

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:42.211
And when we get to America...

01:24:42.245 --> 01:24:44.280
Who knows what will be then.

01:24:44.313 --> 01:24:45.648
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:47.550
Things change.

01:24:47.583 --> 01:24:51.587
People change.
Hairstyles change.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.689
Hillary, I want you to be with me.

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:56.692
Interest rates fluctuate.
Who knows?

01:24:58.026 --> 01:25:00.829
Don't you want to come with me?
If you don't, say so now.

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.499
<i>Want?</i>

01:25:04.633 --> 01:25:06.101
Want.

01:25:06.135 --> 01:25:08.304
More than anything!

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.273
Take me with you.

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:25.788
Goodbye, Chocolate Mousse.

01:25:25.821 --> 01:25:27.423
I'll never forget you.

01:25:28.991 --> 01:25:31.594
Goodbye, Du Quois.
Take care of yourself.

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.130
Goodbye, Deja Vu.

01:25:35.164 --> 01:25:37.500
I'll always remember you.

01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:40.169
And I'll miss you
most of all, Scarecrow.
