WEBVTT

00:31.490 --> 00:32.658
Oh, boy.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.411
Morning, fellas. Sorry I'm late.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.541
Just needed to clear my head
so I decided to, you know, walk to work.

00:40.624 --> 00:43.669
Turns out that clearing and walking
in a town you don't know all too well

00:43.752 --> 00:45.629
can be a little tricky.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.048
Ended up getting lost
but, you know, then I got unlost,

00:48.131 --> 00:49.550
then I got lost again but...

00:49.633 --> 00:53.262
Well, you know, now I'm here, you know.
Beard's here, Nate's here, which is great

00:53.345 --> 00:55.305
because the world
can be a sad, lonely place, but--

00:55.389 --> 00:57.599
Hey, come on now,
let's get to work, shall we?

00:57.683 --> 00:58.767
Michelle.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.269
Which is fine.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.063
You know, it's okay,
'cause it's a great time now for me to,

01:03.146 --> 01:05.858
you know, bury myself in my work here.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.317
And so-- Although, I'm not crazy--

01:07.401 --> 01:09.570
I don't love the word "bury,"
you know what I mean?

01:09.653 --> 01:11.780
It's just got a negative connotation
to it, don't it?

01:11.864 --> 01:13.407
What's another word I could say?

01:13.490 --> 01:17.703
Everyone loves a good bath, right?
Just a nice warm bath, right? Yeah?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.706
So that's what I'll say. I'll say,
"I'm gonna bathe myself in work."

01:20.789 --> 01:22.332
How 'bout that? That's good. That's good.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.168
Nate, you got a favorite bath bomb, buddy?

01:24.251 --> 01:27.296
No, I just don't really enjoy baths,
just 'cause my skin gets really wrinkly,

01:27.379 --> 01:29.089
and I'm deeply worried about aging.

01:29.173 --> 01:32.092
Okay, I get that. What about you, Coach?
You got a favorite bath bomb?

01:32.176 --> 01:33.260
Crème brûlée honey.

01:33.343 --> 01:35.554
Honey? Is that an ingredient
or something you just called me?

01:35.637 --> 01:36.805
-Ingredient.
-Shoot.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.600
I was hoping it was the other one.
But that's kind of a fun idea.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.935
Maybe we start calling each other
little pet names.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.104
You know?
Like "honey" or "babe," you know?

01:44.188 --> 01:46.064
It might be nice, right?
What do you think, Coach?

01:47.024 --> 01:48.317
Nate, will you do me a favor here?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.569
Will you just help Coach
plan practice for today?

01:50.652 --> 01:52.696
-Absolutely. Yeah.
-All right. Thank you, sweetie.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.781
Okay, I'll see y'all in a little bit.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.952
-Is he all right?
-No.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.603
All right. Shall we?
Sarah, why don't you lead us off?

02:24.686 --> 02:28.190
So, Coach Lasso.
You finally won your first match.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.358
How's it feel?

02:29.441 --> 02:32.152
Well, Sarah, I believe you can
outscore your opponent and still lose.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.238
Just like you can score less than them
and win.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.032
But last week we definitely won,
which is pretty darn fun.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.535
All right, next question.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.204
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.164
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

02:45.040 --> 02:48.210
Is it safe to assume that Jamie Tartt
will be back on the pitch next match?

02:48.293 --> 02:50.879
Well, you know what they say
when you assume, Trent?

02:50.963 --> 02:53.841
You make an arse outta you and me. Yeah?

02:55.217 --> 02:56.885
And that right there is another example

02:56.969 --> 03:00.430
of how our English and y'all's English
sometimes do not jive, innit?

03:02.349 --> 03:05.185
But are you honestly gonna keep
your best player on the bench?

03:05.269 --> 03:08.814
Well, that depends on Jamie.
He knows what we need from him.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.024
Let's keep it going, yeah?
Kip, come on, hit me.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.361
-Ted. Just the man I wanted to see.
-Hey, boss.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.364
Your decision to bench Jamie Tartt
was very brave.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.491
-Thank you.
-I mean, a masterstroke.

03:19.575 --> 03:21.577
I don't think we're allowed
to talk like that at work anymore.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.953
There's just one complication now.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.413
Manchester City have called,

03:24.496 --> 03:27.082
and they've inquired
about terminating Jamie's loan.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.585
-They're gonna take his house?
-No.

03:29.668 --> 03:32.963
Ted, Jamie's contract is owned
by Manchester City,

03:33.046 --> 03:35.299
and they, in turn,
loaned him to Richmond for the season.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.134
Okay. I get it.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.469
They want Jamie back
if you are planning to bench him.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.139
I'm not planning on that.
No, my plan is for my plan to work.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.475
But you know what they say about
the best-laid plans, right?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.395
Said "plan" too many times.
Word's lost all its meaning now.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.607
Plan. Plan. Plan. Doesn't matter.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.443
Hey, you tell Man City
that this man has a plan.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.487
-Plan. Plan. Plan?
-Plan.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.989
-Plan?
-Not plan.

03:59.072 --> 03:59.948
-Plan.
-Plan.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.034
-Plan.
-Like "flan." Plan.

04:02.117 --> 04:03.702
Flan? That dessert?

04:03.785 --> 04:04.995
Yes, like "flan."

04:05.078 --> 04:07.039
No, I don't dig on flan.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.791
Plan. Plan.

04:10.209 --> 04:12.127
Plan. Plan?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.463
-Word become a sound?
-What's that called again?

04:14.546 --> 04:16.130
-Semantic satiation.
-Yeah.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.216
Okay. All right.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.719
Is that new kid from Mexico here yet?

04:20.802 --> 04:22.846
-He's getting treatment on his knee.
-Okay, good.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.140
-What's his name again?
-Dani Rojas.

04:25.224 --> 04:27.434
Yeah. It's a great name. Okay.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.644
How's Jamie doing?

04:30.395 --> 04:31.396
What?

04:31.480 --> 04:34.775
Says he can't practice today.
Says he's hurt.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.446
Oh, boy.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.200
Hey, Jamie.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.078
I heard you're not gonna be able
to run with us today. That true?

04:46.161 --> 04:47.538
Yep.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.622
Why's that?

04:49.164 --> 04:50.457
'Cause I'm hurt.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.669
Really sorry to hear that.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.756
Relax, Ted. It's just practice.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.559
Hey.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.310
If you can't practice, you can't practice.

05:10.394 --> 05:13.188
If you're hurt, you're hurt.
It's as simple as that.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.776
But it ain't about that... at all.

05:20.737 --> 05:23.574
You're sitting in here. You're supposed
to be the franchise player.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.535
And yet here we are,
talking about you missing practice.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.706
We're talking about practice.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.833
You understand me? Practice.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.377
Not a game.

05:35.460 --> 05:39.047
Not a game. Not the game
you go out there and die for. Right?

05:39.131 --> 05:40.674
Play every weekend
like it's your last, right?

05:40.757 --> 05:43.051
No, we're talking about practice, man.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.804
Practice! You know
you're supposed to be out there.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.347
You know you're supposed to
lead by example.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.391
You're just shoving that all aside.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.895
And so here we are, Jamie.
We're talking about practice.

05:52.978 --> 05:54.563
Not a game.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.606
Not the game.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.901
We're talking about practice,
with your team. With your teammates.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.613
The only place we get to play together,
we got control over.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.907
Rest of the time
it's us 11 against those 11.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.618
We're talking about practice, man!

06:07.993 --> 06:12.247
I'm talking about practice!
And you can't do it 'cause you're hurt.

06:13.332 --> 06:14.708
Right?

06:15.918 --> 06:17.169
It's fine by me.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.838
Tell you what. Do me a favor.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.215
When you get out there,

06:21.298 --> 06:24.760
set up the cones so the other reserves
can do a little passing drill.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.180
-You want me to set up cones?
-I really appreciate it.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.392
-Colin, go set the cones up.
-I think he asked you, mate.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.852
Was I talking to you, big man?

06:33.936 --> 06:35.896
Colin, set up the cones.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.732
Isaac's right. He asked you.
You are a second-teamer.

06:46.448 --> 06:47.991
That's gotta sting.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.120
Cheers.

06:56.375 --> 06:59.336
I must say, it's quite nice seeing Jamie
put in his place for once.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.255
-Thrilling even, innit?
-No, no, no.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.840
This is a no schadenfreude zone,
all right?

07:02.923 --> 07:04.967
-Nein schadenfreude.
-All right.

07:05.050 --> 07:07.094
The new kid, what's his-- Dani what?

07:07.177 --> 07:09.346
-Rojas.
-Rojas, yeah. Is he any good?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.849
Came here in the summer transfer window,
was immediately injured,

07:11.932 --> 07:14.017
-so no one's really seen him play.
-That's okay.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.645
You know, 'cause once Jamie sees
someone else playing his position,

07:16.728 --> 07:18.939
you know...
I mean, it's gonna hurt his soul.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.694
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't be happy about that.

07:24.570 --> 07:27.155
Okay, let's be sure to help Dani
get acclimated, all right?

07:27.239 --> 07:29.491
First time in this league
can be very overwhelming.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.705
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!

07:34.788 --> 07:40.085
Rojas, Dani Rojas! Rojas, Rojas, Rojas!

07:40.169 --> 07:42.504
Hey! Hello, coaches.

07:42.588 --> 07:45.549
-Thank you for the opportunity.
-Yeah. You are a spirited fella, Dani.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.801
Just go on out there,
and get the striker spot for us, okay?

07:47.885 --> 07:51.763
Yes! Just like back in Guadalajara,
you say it, I do it, Coach.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.557
Football is life!

07:57.728 --> 07:58.937
I like him.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.233
Jamie doesn't.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.153
Chipper dickheads like that
can never back it up on the pitch.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.340
Beautiful cross, Sam!

08:28.217 --> 08:29.635
Football is life!

08:30.969 --> 08:31.970
Oh, boy.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.019
Did you see that?

08:39.102 --> 08:42.438
I can't really tell,
but it seems like he's very good.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.150
Cheers, again.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.612
And some unemployed gaffers are asking
if we'll have an opening soon.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.865
Tony Pulis. Alan Curbishley.
Harry Redknapp called three times.

08:52.783 --> 08:56.745
Hi. I've been up all night
doing deep dives on all the players.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.289
Did you know that Richard
was raised on a goat farm?

08:59.373 --> 09:02.209
And that Isaac's mother
has two left hands?

09:02.292 --> 09:05.546
And I called a couple of contacts
about some sponsorship opportunities.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.214
Even got myself a little work planner.

09:07.297 --> 09:10.217
You couldn't get one
without the word "unicorn" written on it?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.469
Fuck off. It's adorable.

09:14.012 --> 09:17.474
Sorry, I couldn't help but think
how you'd react if I told you to F off.

09:22.813 --> 09:24.815
-That'll be all, Higgins.
-Of course.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.276
I'm really glad to see
that you're laughing.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.069
I just came by to see
if you're okay, really.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.487
Why wouldn't I be?

09:30.571 --> 09:32.948
Oh, Christ.
Have you not seen the news yet?

09:34.074 --> 09:37.703
I really wanted to be the one
to comfort you, not to break it to you.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.372
So, you remember that stunning girl, Bex?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.749
The one that Rupert left with
the night of the gala?

09:45.085 --> 09:47.337
Do you really want me to pretend
that she wasn't mad fit?

09:47.421 --> 09:48.630
I'd appreciate it.

09:48.714 --> 09:52.050
Okay, well. That hideous cow,
whose name's Bex,

09:52.634 --> 09:55.137
-which is actually short for...
-Rebecca.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.806
Yep, which is also your name, as you know.

09:57.890 --> 10:00.225
So the press is calling her--

10:00.309 --> 10:02.436
"New Rebecca." Shit.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.104
Nope.

10:04.771 --> 10:09.193
The press is calling her "Rebecca,"
and you're...

10:10.360 --> 10:11.361
"Old Rebecca."

10:11.778 --> 10:13.989
-What?
-Old Rebecca.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.991
Old Rebecca?

10:19.453 --> 10:22.122
Don't worry about it. You've got this.

10:22.206 --> 10:23.624
And if you ever have a moment,

10:23.707 --> 10:26.126
or if you don't got this,
then you just call me, right?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.314
Wow! That was on purpose, yes?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.024
Yeah. Look, mate.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.776
You're good, yeah, but up here,

10:50.859 --> 10:53.278
there's a difference
between good and great.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.910
1-1. Your turn, amigo.

11:13.757 --> 11:14.758
Fuck's sake.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.844
Right, watch this then. Left post.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.265
Wow. That was good.

11:22.224 --> 11:23.308
I know.

11:25.811 --> 11:26.937
Yeah!

11:35.737 --> 11:36.738
I got lucky.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.908
-Again tomorrow, Jamie Tartt?
-We'll see.

11:39.992 --> 11:41.159
Football is life!

11:43.453 --> 11:46.999
Dani Rojas, Rojas! Dani Rojas!

11:47.082 --> 11:49.918
Oh, boy. I tell you, man.

11:50.002 --> 11:54.339
I feel like we fell out of a lucky tree,
hit every branch on the way down,

11:54.423 --> 11:57.634
ended up in a pool full of cash
and Sour Patch Kids.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.345
I mean, Jamie is an ace, right?

12:00.429 --> 12:03.307
You know, whose attitude
turned him into a seven of clubs.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.059
So then we bring in another fella
to help turn him back into an ace

12:06.143 --> 12:08.103
and then that fella ends up
being an ace himself.

12:08.187 --> 12:09.605
And so now we got two aces.

12:09.688 --> 12:13.609
Aces. Aces.
Oh, heck. I did it again. I'm stuck.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.068
-Aces.
-That's the word, yeah?

12:15.152 --> 12:16.695
-Aces.
-Aces.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.155
-Ace.
-Aces? Oh, now I'm in there.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.532
-See? Okay, good.
-Aces? Aces.

12:20.616 --> 12:22.159
-I hope it's not contagious.
-Aces.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.620
-Aces. Aces.
-Aces? Aces.

12:24.703 --> 12:25.537
-Aces.
-Aces.

12:25.621 --> 12:27.164
-Isis.
-No, that sounds like "ISIS."

12:27.247 --> 12:28.665
I did say "ISIS." I didn't mean to.

12:28.749 --> 12:31.585
Okay, what if we cloned
the lead guitarist from Kiss?

12:31.668 --> 12:33.212
-You'd have two--
-Frehleys.

12:44.306 --> 12:46.683
It's lovely weather we've been having,
don't you think?

12:46.767 --> 12:48.310
I love this time of year.

12:48.393 --> 12:51.104
-All the smells of fresh leaves.
-What's happening?

12:51.188 --> 12:53.774
I was just pretending
that the two of us were on a walk.

12:53.857 --> 12:54.858
I'm trying to read.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.779
I've been doing a lot of reading myself,
actually, recently.

13:00.072 --> 13:01.865
I read this mad story

13:01.949 --> 13:04.785
about a kid who grew up
in a shit part of South London.

13:04.868 --> 13:09.081
And who got sent off to play as a child
in Sunderland, of all places.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.835
And who later was forced
to rap his own verse in a charity single

13:12.918 --> 13:15.379
which was called
"Winner, Winner, Football Dinner."

13:15.462 --> 13:16.922
That was for world hunger.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.633
And I believe it was the cure.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.096
How do you know all this anyway?
What are you doing now? Stalking me?

13:24.179 --> 13:27.140
No. I'm reading all the players' bios.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.852
Rebecca's got me in
to help with the team's PR.

13:29.935 --> 13:32.980
Well, you leave me out of it.
I'm not one of your show ponies.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.400
You wear a number,
trot around while people clap,

13:37.150 --> 13:39.528
so I wouldn't be
too high and mighty about it.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.114
Later, Roy.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.203
Dani Rojas! Dani, Dani!

13:55.752 --> 13:56.753
Okay.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.590
Okay, okay, I don't understand.
What the heck happened, all right?

13:59.673 --> 14:02.384
-Did you trip over something?
-That's the thing, Coach.

14:02.467 --> 14:05.804
I did not trip over something.
Something tripped me.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.931
Something not there.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.480
Yeah. Okay, Doc.
Let's go get him looked at.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.358
Okay. You're okay.

14:19.651 --> 14:21.612
God, this is all my fault.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.530
I saw Dani go into the treatment room
before training,

14:23.614 --> 14:24.865
and I didn't say anything.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.284
That was a mistake.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.036
How could you not say anything?

14:29.119 --> 14:30.621
Well, I hope you've all
said your goodbyes,

14:30.704 --> 14:32.706
-'cause we're never gonna see him again.
-Hey, that's enough!

14:32.789 --> 14:35.459
One more person says something
that me and Beard don't understand,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.669
I'm gonna have one of my son's
classic temper tantrums.

14:37.753 --> 14:39.963
It's basically just him
calling me a bunch of silly names,

14:40.047 --> 14:43.634
you know, like, I don't know,
"dummy head" or "poo-poo face"

14:43.717 --> 14:46.136
or "poo-poo dummy" or-- I don't know.
What am I missing?

14:46.220 --> 14:47.930
-"Pee-pee fingers."
-"Pee-pee fingers."

14:48.013 --> 14:49.681
Come on, now. Spill.

14:52.184 --> 14:55.020
The treatment room is cursed.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.855
-What?
-It's true.

14:56.939 --> 14:59.107
Why is this the first time
I'm hearing about this?

14:59.191 --> 15:02.110
Well, I think it has a lot to do with
grown men being embarrassed

15:02.194 --> 15:05.280
to admit that they believe
in all this hoodoo, voodoo, juju business.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.032
-Hey, I don't believe it.
-Okay, good.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.784
Then me and you,
we're gonna go look in that room.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.410
-No.
-Why not?

15:10.494 --> 15:12.162
Because... No.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.290
Heck! Oh, man.

15:15.374 --> 15:18.168
I mean, Dani was out there,
what, an hour ago?

15:18.252 --> 15:19.795
Running circles on that pitch

15:19.878 --> 15:23.298
like a joyous
raven-haired golden retriever.

15:23.382 --> 15:26.468
Coach, is it true in America you guys
have so many beautiful dogs in pounds

15:26.552 --> 15:28.220
that some get put down for no reason?

15:28.303 --> 15:29.847
That is true, Sam.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.766
But it's also something a lot of female
singer-songwriters are trying to change.

15:33.308 --> 15:36.937
Look, we're not gonna put Dani Rojas down.
I'll tell you that right now.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.065
Gentlemen, I need you to gather up
the rest of the fellas.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.861
'Cause we got ourselves
a curse to reverse.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.120
What the fuck's wrong with you two?

15:53.203 --> 15:55.038
The whole Richmond team's here.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.041
Holy shit.

16:06.091 --> 16:07.801
Hey, Coach. Jamie?

16:10.262 --> 16:11.263
Okay. That's okay.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.764
Hey, guys.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.516
Hey, fellas. Fellas, listen up.

16:15.434 --> 16:16.643
Thank you, guys, for coming out.

16:16.727 --> 16:19.146
Look, I don't know a lot
about this stuff, you know.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.731
I don't know about curses.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.858
But I do know this,
they don't last forever.

16:22.941 --> 16:25.235
Okay, look at the Boston Red Sox curse.
That's over.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.487
Chicago Cubs, over.

16:27.863 --> 16:31.241
Heck, even Mr. Martin Scorsese
finally won his Oscar.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.535
But I think we can all agree that
The Departed

16:33.619 --> 16:34.995
is not necessarily his best work.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.079
-No.
-Yeah.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.291
-That belongs to The Color of Money.
-No, it's Goodfellas.

16:39.374 --> 16:43.003
-Agree to disagree.
-Nah, nah. It's Age of Innocence, bruv.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.631
-Cape Fear.
-Silence!

16:46.465 --> 16:49.009
Oi, once the word gets out
you lot are in here,

16:49.092 --> 16:51.386
this place will turn into a fucking zoo.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.639
And the answer's Mean Streets.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.641
-Yeah. That's a good one.
-Yeah.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.310
You're all here
because of this poster behind me.

16:58.393 --> 16:59.436
Mr. Higgins.

16:59.520 --> 17:02.856
"Are you a fast, fit, fan of football?"

17:02.940 --> 17:04.733
That's solid alliteration right there.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.233
Hundreds of those posters

17:06.318 --> 17:11.448
were put up around Richmond
on the 18th of November, 1914.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.909
It was an invitation for young men

17:13.992 --> 17:16.662
to try out to be
a professional footballer.

17:16.743 --> 17:19.454
It said to come to our stadium that day.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.375
And it was a lie.

17:21.458 --> 17:26.797
In 1914, the war was raging.
There was no tryout.

17:26.880 --> 17:32.469
Just recruiters, waiting to encourage
those boys to fight the fight.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.764
They enlisted 400 lads that day.

17:37.099 --> 17:38.475
Very few of them came home.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.061
And after they enlisted...

17:41.854 --> 17:43.772
do you know where they went
for their physical?

17:43.856 --> 17:46.191
Oh, Christ,
it's our treatment room, isn't it?

17:46.275 --> 17:47.609
What are you talking about?

17:47.693 --> 17:51.989
Hey, no, no, no. Hey, no, fellas.
No, it was not, okay?

17:54.283 --> 17:56.702
It was. I'm sorry, I'm lying to ya.
I don't even know why I'm lying.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.912
I'm sorry. I just wanted y'all
to take a breath for a second.

17:58.996 --> 18:01.707
Wait, wait, wait. What you're telling me
is that we've got 400 ghosts?

18:01.790 --> 18:03.041
That's too many ghosts.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.209
We cannot fight them all.

18:04.293 --> 18:06.044
We're not going
to have to fight them, Richard.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.213
Wait, so, Coach, how do we fix this?

18:08.297 --> 18:11.049
-We can't change the past.
-No, Sam. No, we cannot.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.177
But we can choose to honor it.

18:13.844 --> 18:16.346
Now, those young men,
they made the ultimate sacrifice.

18:16.430 --> 18:19.516
So I think it's only fair
that we sacrifice something of our own.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.352
I'm gonna ask each and every one of you
to go home tonight,

18:22.436 --> 18:24.605
find something, an item.

18:24.688 --> 18:26.857
Something personal.
Something that you truly value.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.110
And I want you to bring it tonight
to the clubhouse, at midnight.

18:30.194 --> 18:31.737
No. That is bullshit.

18:33.739 --> 18:35.616
We're all going to fucking do it!

18:36.158 --> 18:37.075
All right.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.120
That's your captain talking right there.

18:40.204 --> 18:45.167
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

18:45.709 --> 18:46.710
Told you.

18:46.793 --> 18:51.298
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

18:51.381 --> 18:54.259
Hi, Jamie. What do you need?

18:55.427 --> 18:58.555
Babe, I said it was important.
We can't go inside your house?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.432
No way! We can't.

19:00.516 --> 19:02.643
Sex was, like, the only thing
that you and I was good at.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.187
I've had three glasses of wine.
It's Pavlovian.

19:05.896 --> 19:08.273
Pavlovian? What is that? Is that the wine?

19:09.608 --> 19:12.027
Babe, can we not at least
just get inside my car? It's cold.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.863
No. You don't remember how many times
we shagged in this thing?

19:14.947 --> 19:17.032
So the car's also Pavlovian?

19:17.115 --> 19:18.116
Think I'm getting it now.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.453
So, what's up, Jamie?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.164
Fucking Ted Lasso.

19:24.248 --> 19:26.208
He's really gotten up your bum, hasn't he?

19:26.291 --> 19:28.168
Babe, he's not even a real coach.

19:28.252 --> 19:29.920
Do you know what
we're supposed to do tonight?

19:30.003 --> 19:33.799
Apparently, some bullshit sacrifice,
show-and-tell bullshit.

19:34.341 --> 19:37.052
-Okay. You gonna go?
-No, 'course I'm not.

19:38.762 --> 19:41.849
-Is everyone else doing it?
-Yeah, but I'm Jamie Tartt.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.433
I'm not like everyone else.

19:43.517 --> 19:48.146
Do you think that I could've got
from a council estate in North Manchester

19:48.230 --> 19:49.898
to the Premier League,

19:50.649 --> 19:52.109
if I did what everyone else did?

19:52.192 --> 19:54.194
No. I don't.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.197
You're a battler, Jamie.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.449
It's really hot.

20:00.909 --> 20:03.287
But maybe someday
you should stop battling the people

20:03.370 --> 20:04.830
that just wanna help you.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.794
I feel like you want me to come in.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.254
It's Pavlovian.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.423
Have a good night, Jamie Tartt.

20:21.722 --> 20:22.764
Come in.

20:23.473 --> 20:27.769
Excuse me, Ms. Welton. Hi, I'm Sam.
Sam Obisanya. I play for the team.

20:27.853 --> 20:30.355
Yes, Sam. I know who you are.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.525
Is there something I can help you with?

20:33.609 --> 20:36.904
This is really awkward,
but are you free tonight?

20:38.030 --> 20:40.490
Sam, I am very flattered, but--

20:40.574 --> 20:43.327
No, no, no. It's not for romance.

20:43.410 --> 20:47.206
It's just to get rid of this curse.
I can understand why you misinterpreted.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.498
I mean, you're so lovely

20:48.582 --> 20:50.834
you must get romantic invitations
all the time.

20:50.918 --> 20:51.919
That's nice.

20:52.002 --> 20:56.423
Gosh, I'm dealing with
my own sort of curse. Anyway, thank you.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.761
I'm from Nigeria, and so I feel like
whenever the subject of curses comes up,

21:00.844 --> 21:04.348
people are like, "I bet the African guy
is really into this."

21:04.431 --> 21:06.683
-You're obviously not?
-No, no, no. I really am.

21:06.767 --> 21:09.019
But that's mainly
from loving Harry Potter.

21:09.561 --> 21:11.730
Do you know J.K. Rowling
has more money than the Queen?

21:11.813 --> 21:12.981
I did.

21:13.065 --> 21:16.235
I like the idea of someone becoming rich,
because of what they gave to the world.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.903
Not just because of who their family is.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.990
Well, Ms. Welton, I really hope you can
participate in this ceremony

21:22.074 --> 21:23.492
that we're having later tonight.

21:23.575 --> 21:24.868
I don't think so.

21:24.952 --> 21:27.412
I apologize,
but I can't take no for an answer.

21:27.996 --> 21:30.624
Coach thinks it will only work
if the whole team is there,

21:30.707 --> 21:33.710
and Ms. Welton, it's your team.

21:35.420 --> 21:38.173
So you have to be there. Please.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.468
At least think about it.

21:42.803 --> 21:43.971
For you, Sam, I will.

21:44.555 --> 21:45.597
Thank you.

21:49.643 --> 21:50.811
See you tonight.

21:50.894 --> 21:51.895
See ya.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.735
Gentlemen, I am, by nature, a believer.

21:58.819 --> 22:01.321
Ghosts, spirit guides, aliens.

22:01.405 --> 22:02.781
Still, I can't actually tell you

22:02.865 --> 22:05.284
what lives beyond our physical world
and what doesn't.

22:06.702 --> 22:08.078
What I can tell you,

22:08.161 --> 22:09.913
is that with the exception

22:09.997 --> 22:12.082
of the wit and wisdom
of Calvin and Hobbes,

22:13.333 --> 22:14.751
not much lasts forever.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.885
-Hey, boss. Glad you could join us.
-Hello. Yeah.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.932
Roy, why don't you
get things started for us?

22:35.063 --> 22:38.025
I was nine
when I got scouted by Sunderland,

22:38.734 --> 22:41.361
and I'd never left London before.

22:42.154 --> 22:47.951
My granddad drove me all the way there,
and it was freezing, and I was terrified.

22:49.703 --> 22:51.705
I was fucking nine. Say something.

22:53.707 --> 22:57.044
When I got there,
he gave me this old blanket.

22:57.628 --> 23:01.632
He said it was to keep me warm
and to remind me of home.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.717
And that was the last time I saw him.

23:03.800 --> 23:07.804
'Cause he'd passed away by the time
I got back for Christmas, so...

23:09.348 --> 23:13.310
That is why blankie means so much to me.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.686
Did you just say "blankie"?

23:14.770 --> 23:17.523
No, I said "blanket."
Conversation over. Sam, go.

23:19.066 --> 23:22.110
This is a picture
of the 1994 Nigerian World Cup team.

23:23.237 --> 23:26.240
I pledged I wouldn't take this down
until I made the team myself...

23:27.282 --> 23:28.700
and I still intend to do that.

23:31.745 --> 23:34.998
This sand is from a beach in St. Barts.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.711
This is the first beach where I ever...

23:41.255 --> 23:43.924
It's the first beach where I ever slept
with a supermodel.

23:49.388 --> 23:51.640
-Smile because it happened.
-Thanks.

23:51.723 --> 23:54.309
Sam and Richard coming at ya
from both ends of the spectrum there.

23:54.393 --> 23:55.394
Appreciate that.

23:55.769 --> 24:00.941
A girl once said I look like Clive Owen
in these sunglasses.

24:02.901 --> 24:04.236
I don't think I can do it.

24:04.319 --> 24:06.697
-Come on, Nate. Throw 'em in.
-You got it, Nate. Give it a toss.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.282
-Nice.
-Good boy, Nate.

24:08.949 --> 24:09.992
Thank you. Thank you.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.915
Is that today's paper?

24:16.999 --> 24:20.669
There's something in there about me,
as usual, and I'm trying not to care.

24:22.671 --> 24:23.881
Fuck the haters.

24:26.466 --> 24:27.467
Word.

24:27.551 --> 24:31.972
This is my cat's collar.
She was a faithful companion for 20 years.

24:33.932 --> 24:35.767
Gonna miss you, Cindy Clawford.

24:37.311 --> 24:39.229
It's the only pen
I can write my name with.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.043
The keys to my Lamborghini.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.129
How you getting home?

25:05.339 --> 25:07.591
-All right. Everybody go?
-Yeah.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.344
-Yeah.
-No. I wanna go.

25:19.895 --> 25:23.148
These aren't my first boots or anything.
My mum gave 'em me.

25:24.900 --> 25:27.402
She was the one who got me into football
in the first place.

25:28.529 --> 25:32.324
Her and me dad split up
when I was just a sexy little baby.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.328
She's the reason I work so hard.
Just wanted to make her proud.

25:37.496 --> 25:39.414
She doesn't even care if I'm any good.

25:39.498 --> 25:42.084
Just wants me to be happy. Be a good lad.

25:43.544 --> 25:47.506
Once I got good though, me old man
started showing up, didn't he?

25:47.589 --> 25:50.259
You know, bragging to all his mates
every time I scored a goal.

25:50.342 --> 25:56.139
Calling me "soft" if I didn't...
dominate, you know.

25:56.223 --> 25:57.766
And I hated that.

25:59.268 --> 26:01.270
I actually fucking hated that.

26:03.522 --> 26:09.361
So, I made a vow to be so tough
that he could never call me "soft" again.

26:12.531 --> 26:14.575
I wonder if sometimes...

26:15.450 --> 26:17.202
I forget about making her proud.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.957
I don't think that she would be lately.

26:34.928 --> 26:36.180
Well, gentlemen...

26:39.099 --> 26:40.934
What do you say we burn this crap?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.936
Maybe we should do this part outside.

26:43.020 --> 26:44.188
-Yeah.
-That's a good call.

26:44.271 --> 26:45.272
Yeah. That's smart. Okay.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.232
Hey, would you guys mind
grabbing this for me?

26:54.698 --> 26:57.326
Excuse me, Ted. The eagle has landed.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.537
Hey, fellas.

27:00.621 --> 27:04.082
I think the only way to know
if the curse has been lifted or not,

27:04.166 --> 27:06.710
we need to ask the spirits for a sign.

27:08.504 --> 27:09.713
Spirits...

27:11.256 --> 27:12.925
speak to us.

27:16.261 --> 27:20.182
Dani Rojas! Rojas! Dani Rojas.

27:23.894 --> 27:26.563
I brought a bottle of mezcal
to throw into the curse fire.

27:26.647 --> 27:28.565
Hey, hey, hey. Rojas, look.

27:28.649 --> 27:30.984
Whatever ghosts it were
that made you trip over,

27:31.068 --> 27:32.903
they're gone now, I promise, yeah.

27:32.986 --> 27:34.321
Crack that bastard open.

27:34.404 --> 27:36.448
-Yeah, boy!
-Yeah.

27:36.532 --> 27:40.369
Jamie's not wrong. Ghosts prefer
empty bottles that we've all drunk.

27:40.452 --> 27:41.787
Fact.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.039
Let us celebrate, amigos.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.502
That is a team united.

27:49.878 --> 27:52.506
You're very lucky that everything's fine
with Dani's injury.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.050
I just never had you pegged
as a gambler, Ted.

27:55.133 --> 27:58.679
I'm not. We knew Dani's okay hours ago.

27:59.304 --> 28:01.306
In fact, it was my man Higgins' idea

28:01.390 --> 28:04.434
not to share that info with the boys
until after the ceremony.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.563
-You don't say.
-Yeah.

28:08.063 --> 28:09.648
Putting the team first, eh, Higgins?

28:10.524 --> 28:11.567
Yeah, I suppose I am.

28:11.650 --> 28:13.694
Hey, Coach, you joining the party or what?

28:14.987 --> 28:17.698
What do you say, boss?
A lot warmer over there by the fire.

28:19.533 --> 28:20.868
I'll respectfully pass.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.454
Higgins, coming with me?

28:26.415 --> 28:27.666
Off you go.

28:31.128 --> 28:33.046
All right now, what's this going on?

28:33.130 --> 28:35.007
What's going on here? What's going on?

28:35.090 --> 28:36.884
Richmond till we die.

28:36.967 --> 28:38.760
We're Richmond till we die.

28:38.844 --> 28:42.306
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.559
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:45.642 --> 28:48.812
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:48.896 --> 28:52.065
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:52.149 --> 28:55.527
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:55.611 --> 28:58.655
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

28:58.739 --> 29:01.992
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

29:02.075 --> 29:05.662
We're Richmond till we die.
We're Richmond till we die.

29:05.746 --> 29:08.665
We know we are, we're sure we are.
We're Richmond till we die.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.834
Morning. How y'all doin'?

29:16.089 --> 29:17.341
Hey. That's cool.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.261
Oh, boy. Here we go.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.599
I got it.

29:26.767 --> 29:29.269
Interception. Easy, gentlemen, easy.

29:30.687 --> 29:32.272
Good morning, honey bunch.

29:32.356 --> 29:34.942
You hear that buzz out there? I love it.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.109
How you doing?

29:38.654 --> 29:39.988
You got rid of Jamie?

29:40.614 --> 29:42.449
Man City recalled him.

29:42.533 --> 29:44.493
I told you, Ted.
They were concerned he wasn't playing.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.161
I finally got through to him!

29:46.245 --> 29:48.247
I mean, you saw it.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.875
With him and Dani,
we had two aces, Rebecca.

29:51.959 --> 29:54.795
-I thought that was what you wanted.
-Yeah, well, you thought wrong!

29:55.587 --> 29:57.881
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for my tone there,
okay. That was rude.

29:57.965 --> 30:02.636
Look, I'm trying to be cool about this,
but I am just seeing red everywhere.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.597
Well, perhaps you should leave
before you say something you'll regret.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.601
No, actually, you know what? Here you go.

30:10.185 --> 30:11.186
Your biscuits.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.146
I hope they're not as good
as they usually are.

30:13.230 --> 30:16.900
But dang it, they're the best batch yet.
I finally cracked the recipe!

30:24.950 --> 30:26.034
Coach?

30:30.289 --> 30:31.790
Football is life.
