WEBVTT

00:09.426 --> 00:11.345
Come on! Come on! Let's do this!

00:11.428 --> 00:12.387
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

00:12.471 --> 00:13.639
Go! Go! Go!

00:47.130 --> 00:49.383
Rupert and I bought this
on our fifth anniversary.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.344
Well, you have exquisite taste.

00:53.595 --> 00:54.596
Do you want it?

00:55.556 --> 00:59.142
But it's a Hockney.
It must be worth a million pounds.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.979
Good point. You should've said yes.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.856
-Auction pile, please.
-Right away, ma'am.

01:08.735 --> 01:11.864
So, Mrs. Mannion--

01:11.947 --> 01:14.199
Excuse me. Ms. Welton.

01:15.534 --> 01:16.577
George is here.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.245
If he's here, why isn't he here?

01:18.328 --> 01:20.956
Yes. Good point.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.541
George.

01:23.125 --> 01:25.294
-Higgy boy.
-Good one.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.046
Hey. I love what you've done to the place.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.924
Did you do it yourself
or get some poof to help you?

01:31.008 --> 01:33.135
I could ask the same of your hair. Please.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.221
She's a cheeky one, isn't she?

01:36.847 --> 01:39.099
Right, love.
Listen, I've got training in a minute.

01:39.183 --> 01:42.728
So whatever it is
you need to get off your impressive chest,

01:42.811 --> 01:44.479
-let me have it.
-Of course.

01:44.563 --> 01:45.564
You're fired.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.024
Yeah, right.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.651
And I'll be buying out
the remainder of your contract. So...

01:51.195 --> 01:52.821
Wish you the best of luck.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.116
Fired? What the fuck for?

01:58.243 --> 02:00.954
I suppose I could go for
any number of reasons, really.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.332
Your casual misogyny, for one.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.250
-What?
-I know, it's a big word.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.960
Ask one of your daughters what it means.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.628
Or perhaps it's your performance,

02:08.711 --> 02:12.633
having led this team through
yet another remarkably average season.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.302
Or maybe it's because you insist
on wearing those tiny shorts

02:15.385 --> 02:17.137
that force me to see
one of your testicles.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.681
And there's the other one.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.433
Liam and Noel.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.519
Though, perhaps not an oasis.

02:23.602 --> 02:26.188
Still, if I'm being
completely honest, George,

02:26.271 --> 02:29.525
you're fired because I'm the owner now,
and I don't like you.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.945
Now do piss off, you fat twat.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.991
Hey, Higgy boy.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.493
What do you think's worse?

02:39.576 --> 02:43.747
Your husband cheating on you
or being the last to know?

02:46.708 --> 02:48.961
Is there someone that could pop out
and fetch me a salad?

02:50.629 --> 02:53.006
Nothing with raisins in it, please.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.216
Fuck you.

02:54.883 --> 02:58.262
So, what to do as far as new managers go?

02:58.345 --> 03:00.889
Shall I prepare a list of candidates?

03:00.973 --> 03:03.642
No. That won't be necessary.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.733
This is a bit of surprising news
from the other side of the Atlantic.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.611
AFC Richmond announced
the hiring of their new manager,

03:14.695 --> 03:16.947
one Theodore "Ted" Lasso.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.410
Recently, it was Coach Lasso leading
the Division II Wichita State Shockers

03:21.493 --> 03:24.329
to their first ever national title
in American football.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.915
He took the Shockers
from a garbage program

03:26.999 --> 03:29.918
all the way to the promised land
in his very first season as head coach.

03:30.002 --> 03:34.006
But for a lot of us, that's not how
Ted Lasso found his way into our hearts,

03:34.089 --> 03:35.591
certainly not into our living rooms.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.217
For me, it'll always be Ted...

03:38.552 --> 03:40.470
celebrating a moment of joy with his team

03:40.554 --> 03:42.764
in a way that you really have to see
to understand.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.349
And then, even when you see it...

03:45.601 --> 03:48.353
I don't necessarily know
that understanding is what we're doing.

03:50.606 --> 03:52.107
Right on, Ted. Do your thing, man.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.526
And good luck
with the most beautiful game.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.236
Do us proud.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.321
Go, 'Murica.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.503
Oi, mate. This you?

04:12.586 --> 04:15.214
-I believe it is, yeah.
-Oh, man! Legend.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.548
Can I get an ussie?

04:17.966 --> 04:19.218
That's dope.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.303
You know, back where I'm from,
we call those selfies.

04:21.386 --> 04:22.638
Well, it's not "myself," yeah?

04:22.721 --> 04:24.389
It's "us," innit? "Ussie."

04:24.473 --> 04:25.891
Yeah. I like that.

04:25.974 --> 04:26.892
Wicked.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.810
You coaching football.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.355
Mate, you are a legend
for doing something so stupid.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.107
I mean, it's mental.
They're gonna fucking murder you.

04:34.650 --> 04:36.985
Well, you know,
I've heard that tune before.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.695
But here I am, still dancing.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.114
-Legend.
-Yeah. Nice meeting you.

04:45.536 --> 04:47.204
What you reading? Another soccer book.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.580
Coach, you are a sponge.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.208
Come on. Hit me with a fun fact.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.919
They don't say "out of bounds."
They say "into touch."

04:54.002 --> 04:56.755
Okay, you owe me five bucks
if I sneak that into a sentence later.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.340
-You're on.
-Okay.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.052
Good evening.
We'll be dimming the cabin shortly.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.346
We should get some sleep.
The jet lag will kill us.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.682
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.727
Are we nuts for doing this?

05:11.353 --> 05:12.521
Yeah, this is nuts.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.315
Hey, but taking on a challenge
is a lot like riding a horse, isn't it?

05:15.399 --> 05:16.984
If you're comfortable
while you're doing it,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.068
probably doing it wrong.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.697
-Okay, good night, Coach.
-Night, Coach.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
Hey, hey, hey!

05:26.743 --> 05:30.122
If we see each other in our dreams,
let's goof around a little bit,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.541
-pretend like we don't know each other.
-You got it, stranger.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.042
Nice.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.495
-You didn't sleep at all?
-Not a wink.

06:10.579 --> 06:12.748
No. My brain just kept on cooking.

06:12.831 --> 06:14.708
At first,
I was thinking about not sleeping.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.419
Then I was thinking about
thinking about not sleeping. And that--

06:17.503 --> 06:18.837
That's never good.

06:18.921 --> 06:19.922
Next thing you know,

06:20.005 --> 06:21.798
they're handing out
warm chocolate chip cookies

06:21.882 --> 06:23.175
and the plane's landing.

06:23.258 --> 06:25.344
I didn't get a cookie. Did you eat mine?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.221
That's not part of the story.
I think this is us right here.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.472
Hey, how ya doin'?

06:28.555 --> 06:29.973
-My name's Ted. What's yours?
-Ollie.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.517
-Ollie. All right.
-Let me get your bags.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.977
No, no, no, Ollie.
We packed 'em, we'll carry 'em.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.979
Love to make a little pit stop though.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.064
Okay. Follow me.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.779
Yeah. There you go.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.158
Coach, I got a feeling
we're not in Kansas anymore, right?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.703
I've never actually said that
when not in Kansas before.

06:51.787 --> 06:53.539
-That's kinda nice.
-Yeah.

06:54.665 --> 06:56.458
Well, thanks for indulging us, Ollie.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.918
Ready to boogie whenever you are.

06:58.001 --> 06:59.503
Okay. That's Tower Bridge.

06:59.586 --> 07:02.422
Right. Not the London Bridge,
'cause this one's still up.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.929
You know how they came up with soccer?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.597
So, these Victorian-era headmasters,

07:10.681 --> 07:13.433
all they wanted to do
was get the boys to stop masturbating.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.187
So they invented a sport where the boys
wouldn't use their hands at all,

07:17.271 --> 07:19.064
and they thought that might do the trick.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.816
I'm not sure if it worked, but...

07:36.707 --> 07:38.584
Feels different, Coach.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.335
I mean, the same, but different.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.421
-Metaphor.
-You know it, baby.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.589
Oi!

07:43.672 --> 07:45.716
Oi! Excuse me!

07:45.799 --> 07:47.009
Oi! Hello!

07:47.092 --> 07:48.427
Off! Off!

07:48.510 --> 07:50.095
Stop touching the grass!

07:50.179 --> 07:52.890
Get off! Get off the pitch!
Stop touching the grass! Please!

07:52.973 --> 07:54.308
-Yep, yep, yep. Yeah.
-Who are you?

07:54.391 --> 07:56.310
I'm Ted Lasso. This is Coach Beard here.

07:56.393 --> 07:58.645
-Oh, God. You're the new manager.
-Yes, sir.

07:58.729 --> 08:00.397
-Take all the grass you want.
-Oh, no--

08:00.480 --> 08:01.732
We just had it cut.
I can go through the garbage.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.942
-I can get you some more.
-That's all right. No need.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.528
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

08:07.738 --> 08:08.989
Yeah.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.492
-Still, we got to get off the grass.
-Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

08:12.576 --> 08:13.410
Do we apologize?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.120
-Sorry about that, grass.
-Sorry, grass.

08:16.163 --> 08:18.081
So, we're supposed to meet
with a Rebecca Welton.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.416
Yeah, that's where I'm taking you.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.918
Look at this guy. One step ahead.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.920
Hey, what's your name, by the way?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.087
-Me?
-Yeah.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.547
No one ever asks my name.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.138
I mean, whenever you're ready.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.681
Oh, it's Nathan.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.225
Nathan! I love that name.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.392
Hey, love your hot dogs.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.102
Yeah. No, I know.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.605
Good, good.
Y'all got Nathan's hot dogs here?

08:41.688 --> 08:42.688
No.

08:42.773 --> 08:43.774
Okay.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.985
I love this kid. Love him.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.863
I'll introduce you. Big boss.

08:49.947 --> 08:50.948
Here we go.

08:52.491 --> 08:53.492
Hello.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.255
Hey, how y'all doing?
I'm Ted Lasso, your new coach.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.716
-You must be Ms. Welton.
-Please, call me Rebecca.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.009
Ms. Welton's my father.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.637
If that's a joke, I love it.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.514
If not, I cannot wait
to unpack that with you.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.057
This here is Coach Beard.

09:17.140 --> 09:20.269
It is so good
to finally meet you both face-to-face.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.186
Higgins?

09:21.270 --> 09:24.898
Sorry. This is Higgins,
our current director of communications.

09:24.982 --> 09:25.983
Current?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.653
Could you take Coach Beard and get him
their IDs, housing information...

09:29.736 --> 09:31.238
You know, anything they need.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.116
-Wi-Fi password, wet wipes.
-Humidifier. Way ahead of you, Coach.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.284
Thank you.

09:37.703 --> 09:39.705
-Please, take a seat.
-Okay.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.291
-Can I get you something to drink?
-Yes, please.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.334
Didn't get much sleep on the plane,
so anything you got,

09:44.418 --> 09:46.253
a little boost of caffeine,
should do the trick.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.172
You know, mochaccino, Frappuccino...

09:48.255 --> 09:51.008
Any coffee thing, as long as
I can't taste a hint of coffee, is good.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.176
How do you take your tea?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.761
Well, usually I take it
right back to the counter

09:54.845 --> 09:56.805
'cause someone's
made a horrible mistake. But...

09:56.889 --> 09:57.764
when in Rome, right?

09:58.849 --> 10:01.435
Yeah. Look at that. Okay.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.231
Well?

10:06.315 --> 10:09.276
You know, I always figured that tea
was just gonna taste like hot brown water.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.527
And you know what?

10:10.611 --> 10:13.322
I was right.
Yeah, it's horrible. No, thank you.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.656
Welcome to England.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.241
Yeah. "Get used to it, sucker." Right?

10:16.325 --> 10:18.160
Now, would you like a tour?

10:18.243 --> 10:20.621
-I'd love to see Abbey Road.
-Of the club.

10:20.704 --> 10:21.788
Yeah, let's start there.

10:21.872 --> 10:26.877
So, this hall represents
the club's long, albeit modest, history.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.795
The first match was played in 1897.

10:28.879 --> 10:33.050
During the war, our stadium
was used as a makeshift hospital.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.593
Yeah, some of the locals claim

10:34.676 --> 10:37.679
they still see fallen soldiers
wandering around the pitch.

10:37.763 --> 10:39.139
That's spooky.

10:39.223 --> 10:42.059
-Do you believe in ghosts, Ted?
-I do.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.354
But more importantly, I think they need
to believe in themselves. You know?

10:46.438 --> 10:47.272
Okay.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.900
And this is a wall of our previous owners.

10:50.442 --> 10:52.778
Okay. And now look at this fella up here.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.405
How 'bout the girls
and the champagne and everything?

10:55.489 --> 10:56.949
He looks like a good time.

10:57.032 --> 10:58.242
That's my ex-husband.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.745
Well, good times aren't always
a good time, I've found.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.664
You know, I heard about all that.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.040
How you holding up?

11:07.209 --> 11:08.585
Yeah, hasn't been the easiest year.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.711
Yeah.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.090
-So, we'll need you to speak to the press.
-Yeah.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.843
No, after a couple nights' good sleep,
I'll be happy to do so.

11:15.926 --> 11:18.428
I'm so sorry. I thought you knew.
They're ready for you now.

11:18.512 --> 11:19.346
They're what?

11:21.807 --> 11:23.016
So, without further ado,

11:23.100 --> 11:26.979
the new manager of AFC Richmond,
Ted Lasso!

11:33.527 --> 11:34.778
Okay.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.697
All right. How y'all doing?

11:40.284 --> 11:41.159
There's Coach.

11:41.243 --> 11:43.787
Oluwa Ted, yo.

11:43.871 --> 11:45.163
Look, our coach.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.208
Oi!

11:48.292 --> 11:51.003
If I don't hear silence,
I'm gonna start punching dicks.

11:52.004 --> 11:54.423
One sec. Let me just--
Throat got a little dry.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.805
Did not expect fizzy water there. Sorry.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.807
Look at this twat!

12:03.891 --> 12:05.392
Fucking Yank!

12:05.475 --> 12:07.394
Okay. So, hey.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.855
Why don't we just jump right in?
Anybody got any questions?

12:11.607 --> 12:13.734
Oh, yeah, no. Should've saw that coming.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.777
You know what?
You can put your hands down.

12:15.861 --> 12:16.987
Real quick--

12:17.070 --> 12:18.155
Yeah.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.531
How about I go ahead and address

12:19.615 --> 12:21.909
the larger-than-average elephant
in the room.

12:21.992 --> 12:27.122
No, I have never coached the sport
that you folks call football at any level.

12:27.206 --> 12:28.207
Jesus.

12:28.832 --> 12:29.917
What?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.878
Heck, you could fill two Internets
with what I don't know about football.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.547
But I'll tell you what I do know.

12:35.631 --> 12:38.675
I know that AFC Richmond,
like any team I've ever coached,

12:38.759 --> 12:41.094
is gonna go out there
and give you everything they got

12:41.178 --> 12:42.554
-for all four quarters.
-Halves.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.265
-What was that?
-Two halves.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.600
Right. Sorry. Halves, yeah.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.561
They're gonna give you everything they got
for two halves, win or lose.

12:49.645 --> 12:50.729
Or tie.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.564
Right. Y'all do ties here.

12:52.648 --> 12:54.775
Sorry. That's going to take
some getting used to for me.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.694
'Cause back where I'm from,
you try to end a game in a tie,

12:57.778 --> 13:00.864
well, that might as well
be the first sign of the apocalypse.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.078
Now, look here.
I respect what you folks in the media do.

13:06.161 --> 13:07.996
And my door is always gonna be open.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.500
All right? You can ask me anything.
No topic will be into touch.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.919
All right, one final question.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.505
How about the fellow right there
in the second row.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.589
Yeah.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.716
I like your glasses.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.635
Thank you.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.679
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.014
I just wanna make sure I have this right.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.392
You're an American
who's never set foot in England,

13:28.475 --> 13:31.436
whose athletic success
has only come at the amateur level--

13:31.520 --> 13:33.564
a second-tier one at that--

13:33.647 --> 13:35.607
and is now being charged
with the leadership

13:35.691 --> 13:37.234
of a Premier League football club,

13:37.317 --> 13:40.612
despite clearly possessing
very little knowledge of the game.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.073
You got a question in there, Trent?

13:43.866 --> 13:44.950
Yeah.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.202
Is this a fucking joke?

13:48.537 --> 13:50.873
-Thank you, Trent!
-I love journalists.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.042
I mean, can you even name any footballers?

13:54.126 --> 13:57.296
Well, yeah, you got Ronaldo
and the fellow that bends it like himself.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.506
-Fucking Beckham! Made a film on it!
-You dickhead, mate.

13:59.590 --> 14:00.757
Who the fuck are you?

14:00.841 --> 14:02.968
Do you know how many games
are in a Premiership season?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.219
Not off the top of my head, no.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.015
Nobody can understand you.

14:08.098 --> 14:09.516
Who won the league last year?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.560
I actually don't know the answer to that.
I'm sorry.

14:12.269 --> 14:13.478
What's a goalie?

14:13.562 --> 14:16.023
The fella with the big Mickey Mouse hands
and the-- by the net.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.566
This is bleak.

14:17.649 --> 14:19.151
You need to go back to America.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.662
Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. No, no, I--

14:33.707 --> 14:35.083
The bubbles!

14:35.167 --> 14:37.085
Fucking hell!

14:37.961 --> 14:39.505
Coach Lasso.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.216
Good Lord.
You must forgive my fellow countrymen.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.092
Somewhere over the last few years,

14:44.176 --> 14:47.387
we seem to have abandoned
all sense of manners and hospitality.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.973
My, my, aren't you a salty bunch?

14:50.057 --> 14:53.018
But I can't remember the last time
the press room was this full.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.521
Yet here you all are.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.314
Maybe you're not such a mad notion
after all.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.192
And despite the number of you here,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.194
there is not a single person in this room

15:02.277 --> 15:04.446
who has seen Richmond play
more than I have.

15:04.530 --> 15:08.367
And in all those years under
the stewardship of the previous owner,

15:08.450 --> 15:10.702
I've witnessed nothing
but profound mediocrity.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.289
Am I wrong?

15:14.373 --> 15:15.582
Well, it's a bit harsh.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.503
Am I wrong?

15:20.754 --> 15:21.755
No.

15:22.840 --> 15:26.635
Now, Coach Lasso may not have the CV
that you all find acceptable,

15:26.718 --> 15:28.929
but he does have one thing
this club doesn't:

15:29.012 --> 15:30.430
a trophy from this millennium.

15:31.265 --> 15:34.893
So, like it or not, Richmond
are changing the way we do things.

15:34.977 --> 15:38.063
And from now on,
that way is the "Lasso way."

15:40.399 --> 15:43.777
We look forward to seeing you all
at our next match with Crystal Palace.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.237
Thank you so much.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.365
Nice meeting y'all.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.742
And sorry for spittin'
on all your stuff up here.

15:51.493 --> 15:52.494
Thank you.

15:54.621 --> 15:55.789
I give him three weeks.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.251
Oh, boy. I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.587
Ted, don't you think about them
for another second.

16:01.670 --> 16:02.671
You have a job to do.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.840
And proving them wrong,
just been added to the list.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.675
I appreciate that-- Thank you, Coach.

16:06.758 --> 16:07.759
Yeah.

16:09.094 --> 16:12.097
See, I'm fine when there's no bubbles.
You know, I can do that all day.

16:13.891 --> 16:16.560
Okay. You know,
I'd love to say hi to the team, if I can.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.645
Can't keep a gaffer from his pitch.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.441
You can say that again. Okay.

16:22.524 --> 16:24.067
I am 0 for 2 in that sentence.

16:25.194 --> 16:27.279
Ms. Welton, I was a bit skeptical,

16:27.362 --> 16:31.575
but after hearing you speak in there,
I'm excited by your choice.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.994
Coach Lasso is just what we need.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.370
He's an absolute wanker.

16:35.454 --> 16:36.288
I know.

16:36.371 --> 16:37.664
Pardon?

16:37.748 --> 16:39.208
I hope he fails miserably.

16:40.542 --> 16:45.297
See, my ex-husband truly loved
only one thing his entire life: this club.

16:45.964 --> 16:49.134
And Ted Lasso is gonna help me
burn it to the ground.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.304
'Cause I want to torture Rupert.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.351
I want him to feel like he's being fucked
in the ass with a splintered cricket bat.

16:57.434 --> 17:01.563
Just in and out, over and over,
in a constant loop.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.065
Like a GIF.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.943
That's what GIFs do, isn't it?
They're just...

17:07.194 --> 17:08.403
endless.

17:09.488 --> 17:11.448
That's correct.

17:11.949 --> 17:16.078
Though some people pronounce it "JIF."

17:18.288 --> 17:19.665
-Thank you, Higgins.
-Thank you.

17:23.961 --> 17:26.046
Okay, let me use it in a sentence,
so it sticks.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.297
The "gaffer"-- me--

17:27.381 --> 17:28.966
-is going out to the "pitch"--
-Yeah.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.509
...the grass here-- to watch practice.

17:30.592 --> 17:32.427
"Training." They call practice "training."

17:32.511 --> 17:34.513
All this vernacular. Gonna be tough.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.140
You know what? I'm gonna get it though.
'Cause training makes perfect.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.141
There you go.

17:38.809 --> 17:39.810
There's our man.

17:44.857 --> 17:47.025
Jesus, Mary and fuckface Joseph!

17:47.109 --> 17:49.653
Eyes on the man you're marking! Come on!

17:50.404 --> 17:52.030
-Who is that?
-Roy Kent.

17:52.114 --> 17:55.033
Team captain.
Classic old-school box-to-box midfielder.

17:55.117 --> 17:58.412
-Definitely lost a step.
-But, you know, he's a legend.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.122
Won a Champions League with Chelsea, so...

18:00.706 --> 18:02.666
-Eight years ago.
-Yeah.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.460
Oh, God, what?

18:06.253 --> 18:08.630
That is a darn fine sports mix,
young fella.

18:08.714 --> 18:09.840
Coach, you try this?

18:17.306 --> 18:19.474
That does not come lightly
from that fella, I'll tell you that.

18:19.558 --> 18:21.059
You continue to impress, Nathan.

18:22.311 --> 18:23.687
You remembered my name.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.191
Holy smokes! Did you see that?

18:27.274 --> 18:30.277
That fella looked like a kitty cat
when it gets spooked by a cucumber.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.404
-Who the heck is that?
-Jamie Tartt.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.072
Top scorer on the team.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.157
Fuck off.

18:35.866 --> 18:37.993
-Nate, what's he like?
-Who, Jamie?

18:38.827 --> 18:39.870
He's great.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.039
You know, at football.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.459
Yeah, I know fellas like that.

18:46.502 --> 18:49.213
Sam Obisanya. He's a right back defender
outta the Nigerian league.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.048
Nigeria? Like Africa?

18:52.132 --> 18:53.926
So these fellas
are from all over the place?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.093
I'm open, boyo.

18:55.177 --> 18:56.595
I mean, he must be from England, yeah?

18:56.678 --> 18:58.180
-Wales.
-Is that another country?

18:58.263 --> 19:01.099
-Yes and no.
-How many countries are in this country?

19:01.183 --> 19:02.351
-Four.
-Four.

19:03.268 --> 19:05.229
It's kinda like America these days.

19:05.854 --> 19:06.855
Right.

19:21.203 --> 19:22.829
I do love a locker room.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.332
Smells like potential.

19:26.583 --> 19:28.710
And am I getting notes of Axe body spray?

19:28.794 --> 19:30.337
Spot on, Coach.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.256
But I think they call it
something else here.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.474
Ding, ding, ding.

19:43.809 --> 19:44.852
Lynx.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.145
My favorite of the jungle cats.

19:52.150 --> 19:54.319
Come here. Look at your face.
Look at your face.

19:54.403 --> 19:55.487
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.748
Yeesh.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.208
Last time I saw eyes that cold,

20:08.292 --> 20:10.294
they were going head-to-head
with Roy Scheider.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.337
-Jaws?
-No, All That Jazz.

20:12.421 --> 20:14.298
I'm gonna say something. Howdy, fellas.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.175
Don't stop what you're doing.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.635
My name's Ted Lasso.
This here is Coach Beard.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.679
I know we don't officially start
quite yet,

20:20.762 --> 20:23.098
but, you know,
we just wanted to pop in, say howdy,

20:23.182 --> 20:25.058
let you know
how excited we are to be here--

20:25.142 --> 20:26.268
Knock, knock.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.312
Is everyone in here decent?

20:30.314 --> 20:32.649
Boys, that's disappointing.

20:33.984 --> 20:36.945
Oh, shit. Am I interrupting you?

20:37.029 --> 20:39.573
No, no, that's okay. How can I help you?

20:39.656 --> 20:41.366
No, I'm here to pick up that one.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.868
Yeah. Sorry, Coach.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.120
She made me an appointment.
I'm getting waxed.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.123
It's more for the fans than it is for me.

20:48.207 --> 20:50.834
Score a goal, gotta take my shirt off.

20:50.918 --> 20:52.503
Sweetheart.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.088
I mean, I can stay if you want.

20:56.381 --> 20:57.382
No, that's okay.

20:57.466 --> 20:58.884
All right, cheers.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.302
-Yeah.
-There you go.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.345
All right, kid, after you.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.222
You're gonna be a gentleman now, are you?

21:03.305 --> 21:05.057
No, babe. Just gonna watch your ass.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.684
Fuck off.

21:07.768 --> 21:10.354
Watch it and weep.

21:16.652 --> 21:19.446
Anyhoo, thank you for your time.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.617
Coach. You gotta stay up.

22:06.994 --> 22:09.204
Come on, man. Don't be a sleep cop.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.168
Roy! Hey, Roy!

22:15.878 --> 22:17.629
Yeah? What do you want?

22:17.713 --> 22:19.923
It was real fun
watching you out there today.

22:20.007 --> 22:22.259
You know, the boys really respond to you.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.678
It doesn't surprise me though.
You've had a heck of a career.

22:25.304 --> 22:26.346
Thank you.

22:28.056 --> 22:31.435
Never thought it would end
being coached by Ronald fucking McDonald.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.444
You gonna let him call you that?

22:40.527 --> 22:41.945
I don't think he was referring to me.

22:42.905 --> 22:45.490
He thinks he's mad now,
wait till we win him over.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.744
He'll be furious.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.078
You got any tape?

23:25.155 --> 23:26.114
What you doing in there?

23:27.407 --> 23:29.409
Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Are you all right?

23:29.493 --> 23:30.994
Yeah, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.246
I shouldn't laugh.

23:32.329 --> 23:33.872
It's okay.

23:33.956 --> 23:37.918
No, I was just making some adjustments
to the locker room here.

23:38.001 --> 23:39.503
Nice, yeah.

23:39.586 --> 23:43.048
Though, I believe it's crooked.

23:44.424 --> 23:46.677
Now here I am thinking it was the room
that was all outta whack.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.095
But you know what? I think you're right.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.682
What you doing back here? Where's Jamie?

23:51.765 --> 23:53.267
He left his phone in his locker.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.935
Why didn't he come get it?

23:55.018 --> 23:57.437
He's still getting waxed.
He's surprisingly furry.

23:57.521 --> 23:59.481
The hair was, like, growing back
while she was doing it.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.942
-Come on, now.
-May I?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.777
-Yeah, yeah. Help yourself.
-Thanks.

24:11.702 --> 24:13.412
Lower it down on that side.

24:13.495 --> 24:14.496
Great.

24:14.580 --> 24:15.747
Keep going. Little bit.

24:16.665 --> 24:17.666
Teeny bit more.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.334
Stop! That's perfect.

24:19.418 --> 24:21.920
All right. How 'bout that? Nice teamwork.

24:22.963 --> 24:24.548
-Pow. Yeah.
-Old-school.

24:24.631 --> 24:27.092
-I'm Keeley, by the way.
-Yeah. Hey, I'm Ted Lasso.

24:27.176 --> 24:29.303
No, I know. You're trending hard
on Twitter right now.

24:29.386 --> 24:30.554
How 'bout that.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.931
-Do you even tweet?
-Nah.

24:33.015 --> 24:34.433
But I do beatbox all right.

24:43.817 --> 24:46.820
I never know how to react
when a grown man beatboxes in front of me.

24:46.904 --> 24:48.864
Well, I hope
you never run into Biz Markie.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.742
All right.

24:51.825 --> 24:54.703
Well, if you get curious and you start
searching around on Twitter,

24:54.786 --> 24:56.330
I would avoid #Richmond.

24:56.413 --> 24:59.458
-Okay.
-Or wanker. Or dick.

25:00.083 --> 25:01.752
Well, I'll take your word for it.

25:02.753 --> 25:04.838
Welcome to England.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.806
Thank you.
Hey, and thanks again for the lift.

25:14.890 --> 25:15.849
That's all right.

25:15.933 --> 25:17.559
Hey, this you, Nate?

25:17.643 --> 25:19.520
That one? God, no.
No, couldn't handle that.

25:19.603 --> 25:21.104
This is me. Green one here.

25:21.188 --> 25:23.565
Right. So, get that in there.

25:23.649 --> 25:24.650
Come on.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.361
Already burning the midnight oil,
I see, Ted.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.654
Well, as the man once said,

25:28.737 --> 25:31.323
"The harder you work,
the luckier you get," huh?

25:32.199 --> 25:33.200
On the diagonal.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.244
My apologies, Ted.
We should have ordered you a car.

25:35.327 --> 25:36.662
Oh, no. That's okay.

25:36.745 --> 25:37.829
-Night, y'all.
-Got it.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.376
What is wrong with you?

25:42.459 --> 25:44.586
It's just that everything
I've eaten today...

25:45.546 --> 25:47.464
feels like it's stuck right here.

25:49.508 --> 25:50.759
I got it. I got it.

25:52.803 --> 25:53.804
Here we go.

25:53.887 --> 25:57.182
He seems like such a nice man.
I'm not sure I can do this.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.394
Obviously, for this to work,

26:00.477 --> 26:04.857
I'm going to need the full support
of my new director of football operations.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.277
I'm assuming that's a promotion
and substantial pay rise

26:08.360 --> 26:10.863
that would be of interest to you
and your family.

26:13.407 --> 26:15.534
Hey, look, this car's got
an invisible steering wheel!

26:17.703 --> 26:18.662
I'm just kidding.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.455
It's my man Nate here running the horn.

26:20.539 --> 26:23.166
You're a godsend, Ted Lasso.

26:23.250 --> 26:25.085
Takes one to know one.

26:29.756 --> 26:30.757
Well?

26:32.092 --> 26:33.302
I accept.

26:33.385 --> 26:34.511
Wonderful.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.144
Oh, and Higgins,

26:42.227 --> 26:45.022
I know that there'll be elements
to this little adventure

26:45.105 --> 26:46.398
that will weigh on you a bit.

26:46.481 --> 26:48.734
But I'm sure it won't be harder
than it was

26:48.817 --> 26:51.820
to sneak all Rupert's women in and out
behind my back all those years.

27:07.169 --> 27:08.295
This is you, Coach.

27:09.338 --> 27:11.548
Okay. All right. You good?

27:11.632 --> 27:13.217
-I'm good. You good?
-Yeah.

27:13.300 --> 27:14.468
-Night, Coach.
-Good night, Coach.

27:14.551 --> 27:16.011
I almost forgot.

27:17.304 --> 27:18.805
What's this for?

27:18.889 --> 27:20.557
-"Into touch."
-Get some sleep, Coach.

27:20.641 --> 27:21.850
Yeah, I will.

28:09.106 --> 28:11.567
Hey, big guy. How you doing?
How was school today?

28:12.943 --> 28:13.861
Right.

28:13.944 --> 28:15.529
No, I forgot.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.865
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a little loopy today.

28:18.866 --> 28:20.784
Yeah. Yeah, you could say that.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.788
No, no, that's okay. No.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

28:24.872 --> 28:26.415
Yeah. Yeah, go do your thing. Yeah.

28:26.498 --> 28:28.083
Hey, is your mom there?

28:28.166 --> 28:30.252
Okay. Thanks, big guy.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.420
Hey, I miss you.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.549
Yeah, I love you too.

28:36.258 --> 28:37.259
Okay.

28:46.768 --> 28:48.103
Hey, how you doing?

28:48.770 --> 28:51.440
Yeah. Well, you know,
so far so good. You know?

28:52.858 --> 28:55.194
It's gonna take
some getting used to, yeah.

28:55.277 --> 28:57.946
But I think once we get going,
it's gonna go all right.

28:58.864 --> 29:01.408
Yeah. No, that's true, that's true. Yeah.

29:02.326 --> 29:04.995
Well, you know what?
It's actually pretty nice. Yeah.

29:06.163 --> 29:08.832
Yeah, and tell you what,
they got a cute neighborhood too.

29:08.916 --> 29:09.917
Yeah.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.377
Yeah, you and the little guy
gotta get on over here.

29:12.461 --> 29:13.629
Come check it out.

29:18.634 --> 29:19.927
What? No, what did I say?

29:23.472 --> 29:26.141
But that's what I'm doing though.
I'm giving you that space.

29:27.768 --> 29:28.769
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.354
Yeah, and myself. Right.

29:32.648 --> 29:33.690
Okay.

29:34.441 --> 29:36.443
No, no. That's okay. Yeah, yeah.

29:36.527 --> 29:37.778
Hey, Michelle.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.405
I love you.

29:44.409 --> 29:46.370
No, no, that's okay. You don't have to.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.623
Really. Yeah.

29:52.501 --> 29:53.585
Okay.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.756
All right, now. Good night.

30:15.274 --> 30:17.943
Shoot. Now I can't sleep.
