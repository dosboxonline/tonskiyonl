-We're gonna be there.
-Okay.

09:17.932 --> 09:19.642
-All right. All right.
-ELIJAH: Oh, man.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.354
That all sounds so exciting.
The live audience and all.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.481
Well, why don't you and Madison
come? Come to the taping.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.274
-Seriously?
-KEVIN: Yes.

09:26.358 --> 09:28.234
-Be great.
-Okay.

09:28.318 --> 09:29.444
-Yeah.
-Great! Terrific.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.029
-Yes.
-Now,

09:31.112 --> 09:34.491
-let Brunch 'N' Stuff begin.
-MADISON: I like it.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.784
-Brunch 'N' Stuff.
-MADISON: Yeah.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.494
-All right.
-Better.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.621
All right, well, we're getting
there. We're getting there.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.292
(gasps) We have to get
the bread pudding.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.752
My dad and I

09:45.835 --> 09:47.087
used to come here sometimes,

09:47.170 --> 09:50.090
and we'd skip dinner
and go straight to dessert.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.759
Bread pudding it is, then.
All right.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.594
-(Beth chuckles)
-I'm so excited

09:54.678 --> 09:56.680
to be exploring D.C. with you.

10:02.686 --> 10:04.688
What's wrong?

10:05.730 --> 10:08.733
That's my old ballet teacher.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.614
I haven't seen him
since I quit dance.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.540
-("The Untold"
by Secession Studios playing)
-(dancing footsteps)

10:38.972 --> 10:41.433
-(music stops)
-May I?

10:42.475 --> 10:45.270
Sorry. I hope that it's okay
that I'm here. I just wanted

10:45.353 --> 10:47.856
to get a little practice in
before the showcase tonight.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.315
No need to apologize.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.401
Pirouettes used to be tricky
for me, too.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.111
My old dance teacher taught me

10:53.194 --> 10:57.032
to imagine a string, right,
from the crown

10:57.115 --> 10:59.576
of my head
pulling me all the way up

10:59.659 --> 11:01.494
to the ceiling.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.955
Yeah.
(chuckles)

11:04.039 --> 11:06.374
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.545
Why'd you pick me?

11:12.714 --> 11:16.426
I feel like I'm playing catch-up
to everybody else here.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.219
I was the best
at my old dance studio.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.304
But here?

11:19.387 --> 11:21.348
I'm not the skinniest

11:21.431 --> 11:24.267
or the most flexible.
I don't even have the best feet.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.689
My dad wants me to be
a lawyer like him.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.486
You know,
my mom was a lot like your dad.

11:34.569 --> 11:38.031
She wanted me to be an educator
just like her.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.825
This whole dance world
never made sense to her.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.578
But I fought to be a part of it.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.830
Just like you did.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.002
Stacey, I chose you
because I saw a fire in you

11:51.086 --> 11:52.962
that I recognized in myself.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.636
Try again.

12:00.637 --> 12:02.806
Try again.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.900
<i>Our new neighbors</i>
<i>are just like you.</i>

12:13.983 --> 12:16.027
KATE:
Hey.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.362
Where's Sophie?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.822
She's on the phone
with her mom.

12:18.905 --> 12:20.657
<i>PEGGY: Well, do you think</i>
<i>my feet are too big?</i>

12:20.740 --> 12:23.535
<i>HANK: No. There's just</i>
<i>more of you to love.</i>

12:23.618 --> 12:25.495
(TV mutes)

12:26.538 --> 12:29.207
Are you gonna say something
about my weight?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.084
Do you want me to?

12:32.127 --> 12:34.045
No.

12:34.129 --> 12:36.548
You gonna say something
about my drinking?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.093
Do you want me to?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.514
No.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.519
L.A.'s been tough.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.856
I joined an acting class,

12:52.939 --> 12:54.649
you know,
hoping it would help me.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.860
That's great, Kev.

12:56.943 --> 13:00.155
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Yeah,
but now you want to tell me

13:00.238 --> 13:01.531
what's really going on?

13:05.410 --> 13:06.995
Kevin.

13:08.496 --> 13:12.417
(breathes deeply)

13:12.500 --> 13:14.502
I met this girl.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.798
And she was really cool,
so we started hanging out.

13:18.882 --> 13:20.717
You know, I've been lonely

13:20.800 --> 13:24.137
because, between Sophie's
classes and my auditions,

13:24.220 --> 13:25.597
you know,
we don't get much time to talk.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.725
Kevin, what did you do?

13:30.894 --> 13:32.854
It was just one time.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.815
I swear.

13:35.899 --> 13:39.152
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.780
Oh, God, Kevin. K-K...

13:41.863 --> 13:43.990
How could you do this to Sophie?

13:44.074 --> 13:46.034
How could you do that?
She loves you so much.

13:46.117 --> 13:48.119
Don't you think I know that?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.289
I can't even look at her, Kate.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.749
Every time
I'm in the same room as her,

13:52.832 --> 13:54.042
I feel like I'm gonna throw up
from the guilt.

13:54.125 --> 13:56.127
Good.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.467
-You need to tell her.
-No.

14:02.550 --> 14:03.927
It will kill her, Kate.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.637
What if she doesn't forgive me?

14:05.720 --> 14:07.263
Okay, well, what...?
So, what do you expect?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.973
What...
What am I supposed to do?

14:09.057 --> 14:10.433
I'm supposed to keep this
from her now?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.143
She's one of my best friends.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.145
And I'm your brother.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.816
This is incredible.
Everything looks so real.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.442
Yeah. The first time
Kev brought me backstage--

14:19.526 --> 14:22.821
you wouldn't believe it--
the host of <i>Survivor</i> was there.

14:22.904 --> 14:25.240
-Jeff Probst?
-Jeff mother-lovin' Probst.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.117
-(chuckles) What did you do?
-Uh, I freaked out.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.035
I spilled my cold brew
from crafty all over him.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.537
Crafty is craft services.
It's where they keep

14:30.620 --> 14:31.996
-all the snacks. Yeah.
-Oh...

14:32.080 --> 14:33.331
Yeah, stick with me, kid.
I'll show you the ropes.

14:33.415 --> 14:34.749
-Hey! What's up?
-KATE: Hi.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.793
Thanks for coming. Thanks
for coming. Thanks for coming.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.629
Hi. So good to get to spend
some time with you.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.381
We haven't seen you
since, what, breakfast?

14:41.464 --> 14:42.716
(Toby chuckles)

14:42.799 --> 14:44.426
-Toby.
-What? It's a joke.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.845
'Cause we-we live together.
Never mind. I'll get

14:46.928 --> 14:48.555
-one of the writers
to punch it up.
-KEVIN: Mm.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.098
A punch-up is
when the writers take a bad joke

14:50.181 --> 14:51.766
-and they make it funny.
-Oh, I know.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.977
I learned that
from the <i>Friends</i> reunion.

14:54.060 --> 14:56.021
ELIJAH:
Hey, I saw a gumball machine

14:56.104 --> 14:59.441
on the way in.
Now, are the gumballs real?

14:59.524 --> 15:01.609
They are. They're real, yeah.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.319
Not only that, but you don't
have to put a quarter in,

15:03.403 --> 15:04.988
-so you can just have at it.
-Really?

15:05.071 --> 15:07.866
-KEVIN: Yeah.
-Thanks. Okay.
Okay, you know what?

15:07.949 --> 15:09.951
-I'll bring some back
for the group.
-(phone vibrating)

15:10.035 --> 15:11.161
-Thank you.
-KATE: Oh, thanks.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.163
And I have to take this.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.081
-Sorry about the... joke.
-(Kate clears throat)

15:15.165 --> 15:17.042
-It's all right.
Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.877
Yello.

15:18.960 --> 15:22.505
Oh, hey, Madison.
Listen, I sent you

15:22.589 --> 15:24.341
some flight options
for Thanksgiving. I don't know

15:24.424 --> 15:25.592
if you saw or not,
but I'm thinking we

15:25.675 --> 15:27.218
should book early
because, you know, the seats

15:27.302 --> 15:30.096
tend to fill up... What-what...
What's this? You keep looking

15:30.180 --> 15:32.307
at each other.
What am I missing?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.142
Is this an Elijah thing?
Because obviously,

15:34.225 --> 15:35.560
I mean,
he's more than welcome to come.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.812
Kevin, can we talk
about this later?

15:37.896 --> 15:39.439
I don't want to do this here

15:39.522 --> 15:40.690
on such an important day
for you.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.108
No, you just want to sit here
and continue

15:42.192 --> 15:45.653
to share ominous looks
with each other.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.281
Okay, fine.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.949
Um...

15:50.033 --> 15:51.868
I don't want to go to the cabin.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.538
I want to spend Thanksgiving
with Elijah

15:55.622 --> 15:59.417
here in L.A. With the twins.

16:01.419 --> 16:03.755
P.A.:
Hey, Kevin? We need you on set.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.757
Oh.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.342
Perfect.

16:07.425 --> 16:08.802
Um...

16:10.929 --> 16:14.391
Well, hey, you know,
um, to be continued.

16:23.441 --> 16:25.360
We don't have to stay.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.612
We can get
the bread pudding to go.

16:29.447 --> 16:31.574
I saw that man every day

16:31.658 --> 16:33.660
from when I was 12 to 17.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.079
I was his favorite,

16:36.162 --> 16:39.666
until I started struggling,
and then he just dropped me.

16:42.502 --> 16:46.047
When my dad died, he didn't even
pick up the damn phone.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.882
Want me to go over there

16:47.966 --> 16:49.551
and show him where
his ballet shoes can go?

16:49.634 --> 16:51.678
No.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.933
But I will.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.690
Hey. I'm right here.

17:13.783 --> 17:15.368
Bethany.

17:15.452 --> 17:19.122
It's so nice to see you.
How long has it been?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.249
Uh, 23 months.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.044
Wow. That long, huh?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.212
Well, you look well.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.467
So, w-what have you been up to?
Fill me in.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.635
Um...

17:32.719 --> 17:34.554
I'm an architecture major
at CMU.

17:36.014 --> 17:39.601
That's wonderful. I always knew
you had a bright mind.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.814
Why don't you stop by the studio
one of these days.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.191
The girls would love to see you.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.737
-Sure.
-Yeah.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.489
Great.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.244
Take care.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.083
Um...

18:03.166 --> 18:06.127
Let's just forget about
the bread pudding and go.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.712
Let's go.

18:07.796 --> 18:09.255
Yeah.

18:09.339 --> 18:12.050
All right, let's go.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.891
Hey, phones off, now.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.102
-Hey, guys. You made it.
-Hey.

18:22.185 --> 18:23.561
How you feeling?

18:23.645 --> 18:25.980
Excited and terrified.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.732
-(chuckles)
-Which for some reason

18:27.816 --> 18:29.693
is making me
have to pee a lot, you know.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.319
It's like I'm about to get
onstage and perform.

18:31.403 --> 18:33.196
But this should be
the easy part for you.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.572
You already done
all the hard work.

18:34.656 --> 18:35.824
Now, you just
sit back and watch.

18:35.907 --> 18:37.867
That's what I thought,
but when you perform,

18:37.951 --> 18:39.285
it's like you have some control.

18:39.369 --> 18:40.787
Now, I'm just the lady
waiting in the wings,

18:40.870 --> 18:43.331
hoping everything goes well.

18:43.415 --> 18:47.127
I can't fail at this again,
Randall. I just... I can't.

18:47.210 --> 18:48.878
You won't.

18:48.962 --> 18:52.257
I'm sorry. "You won't"
is not good enough.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.675
Okay? I don't mean

18:53.758 --> 18:54.884
to put too much pressure
on you, baby,

18:54.968 --> 18:56.428
but I'm freaking out right now,

18:56.511 --> 18:58.430
and I'm gonna need one of your
all-time greatest pep talks,

18:58.513 --> 19:00.390
and I'm gonna need it now.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.183
Beth Pearson, you're
an incredible human being...

19:02.267 --> 19:04.686
Damn it. I got to pee again,
baby. I'm so sorry.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.812
Okay.

19:09.190 --> 19:11.234
Not to brag, but...

19:11.317 --> 19:13.236
I think we may have Emeril beat.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.946
Emeril should be
watching us on TV.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.699
(both laugh)

19:17.782 --> 19:19.909
Well, at least we don't
have to worry about dessert,

19:19.993 --> 19:22.245
since Matt is bringing
his "famous" pumpkin pie

19:22.328 --> 19:24.289
to the Thanksgiving
he invited himself to.

19:24.372 --> 19:26.666
What? I invited him.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.044
Yeah, well, he didn't really
give you much of a choice,

19:29.127 --> 19:31.171
did he? I mean,
what else were you gonna do?

19:31.254 --> 19:32.797
This needs some brown sugar.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.389
-(babies crying)
-What's going on down there?

19:41.473 --> 19:42.974
You know, they've been
crying for hours.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.184
They're gonna grow up to sound

19:44.267 --> 19:46.061
like Gilbert Gottfried,
aren't they?

19:46.144 --> 19:47.354
-(audience laughs)
-KEVIN (imitating Gottfried):
Aren't they?

19:47.437 --> 19:48.355
Are you okay?

19:48.438 --> 19:49.731
TYLER:
Let me help.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.524
I knew this wouldn't
go over well.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.735
It's a lot to spring on him.

19:53.818 --> 19:56.571
Maybe it's just easier if
I bring the twins to the cabin.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.199

32:04.758 --> 32:06.801
I'm also well aware that Maddy

32:06.885 --> 32:10.055
is eons out of my league,
but she likes me.

32:10.138 --> 32:13.308
She actually likes me.

32:13.391 --> 32:15.643
And...

32:15.727 --> 32:18.355
I like her.
Oh, man, more than you know.

32:18.438 --> 32:20.106
No, no, I'm-I'm getting
the gist.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.484
Yeah, right.
I-I guess what I'm saying is...

32:24.486 --> 32:26.696
...I hope you're not
biding your time

32:26.780 --> 32:29.949
and playing nice because
you think I'm going away.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.410
Because if you are...

32:34.287 --> 32:36.456
...you're gonna be
waiting a long time.

32:40.168 --> 32:42.837
Point taken.

32:42.921 --> 32:46.716
Okay. Okay.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.134
(chuckles) Thanks.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.303
-Later, man.
-Yup.

32:58.436 --> 33:01.523
Thanks again for all your help.
You are one hell of a sous-chef,

33:01.606 --> 33:03.817
-Miguel.
-Oh, that would be
one hell of a compliment,

33:03.900 --> 33:07.362
-except I'm pretty sure
that you're <i>my</i> sous-chef?
-Mm.

33:07.445 --> 33:08.655
-No. You are.
-Really?

33:08.738 --> 33:11.950
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-I think that... Mm.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.118
Okay.

33:13.201 --> 33:17.247
Um, I'm sorry about earlier.

33:17.330 --> 33:20.083
The little digs at Matt.
Way out of line.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.627
He seems like a really nice guy.

33:22.711 --> 33:24.379
-He really does.
-Your opinion

33:24.462 --> 33:26.256
matters a lot to me, you know?

33:26.339 --> 33:29.551
-(chuckles)
-And I hate to break it to you,

33:29.634 --> 33:33.722
but you're-you're basically
my best friend, Miguel.

33:36.349 --> 33:38.101
Back at you.

33:38.184 --> 33:40.103
(chuckles softly)

33:40.186 --> 33:42.439
Oh, um, I was thinking,

33:42.522 --> 33:45.525
I'd like to invite Marguerite
to Thanksgiving, too.

33:45.608 --> 33:47.277
-If that's okay?
-Oh.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.945
I thought Marguerite
was old news.

33:49.029 --> 33:51.031
Yeah, well,
Marguerite made a comeback.

33:51.114 --> 33:53.158
Turns out she has
a hell of a golf swing.

33:54.617 --> 33:57.829
Well, good for Marguerite.
(chuckles)

33:57.912 --> 33:59.831
Yeah. I look forward
to meeting her.

33:59.914 --> 34:01.916
-Great. Okay.
-Okay.

34:07.339 --> 34:08.757
(door closes)

34:11.009 --> 34:13.011
(strumming chords rhythmically)

34:15.513 --> 34:17.098
Hmm.

34:17.182 --> 34:19.476
Kev, Kev, Kev. Shh, shh, shh.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.478
Could we just keep
the jam sessions

34:21.561 --> 34:23.188
to the daylight hours, please?
I'm still working

34:23.271 --> 34:25.190
-out here.
-No problem. Sorry.

34:25.273 --> 34:27.942
Sorry. Oh, hey. Real quick tip.
Just brother to brother,

34:28.026 --> 34:29.235
that whole Bluetooth thing?

34:29.319 --> 34:31.738
It's driving Kate crazy.

34:33.365 --> 34:35.617
-Thanks for the heads-up.
-No problem.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.285
You know, in fact, uh,
just a little tip for you.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.245
The reason I'm out here
pacing around on my Bluetooth

34:39.329 --> 34:42.040
is because I usually take
these phone calls in this room.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.209
The room that you're
currently using as an Airbnb.

34:44.292 --> 34:47.003
-So that's...
-Okay. I was just trying
to help you out, man.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.880
-Uh-huh.
-All right?
But if you want me to leave,

34:48.963 --> 34:51.925
uh, you just say the word.
I can...

34:52.967 --> 34:54.427
You have a good night, Kevin.

34:54.511 --> 34:57.097
-Okay.
You have a good night. Okay.

38:25.847 --> 38:27.515

38:27.599 --> 38:31.936
you were my sun

38:32.020 --> 38:35.190
Hell, you were like a god to me,
if I'm being honest.

38:35.273 --> 38:36.858
And...

38:38.443 --> 38:40.653
It meant so much
that you chose me

38:40.737 --> 38:42.947
out of all the other girls
to be your favorite.

38:43.031 --> 38:47.035

38:48.036 --> 38:51.039
I was ready to be your star.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.543
But, uh...

38:55.627 --> 38:57.170
when my dad died

38:57.253 --> 39:00.006
and I couldn't perform
up to your standards,

39:00.090 --> 39:01.675
you just...

39:03.093 --> 39:04.135
...tossed me aside.

39:04.219 --> 39:05.845
You literally...

39:05.929 --> 39:08.682
You literally replaced me
with someone else

39:08.765 --> 39:12.936
without a word of comfort
or explanation.

39:13.019 --> 39:14.938

but it wasn't my job
to, uh, coddle you.

39:27.033 --> 39:30.203

39:53.601 --> 39:56.521
And it's the part of me that...

39:56.604 --> 40:00.650
I tried to hide from my husband
and from my girls and...

40:00.734 --> 40:03.236
It's the part of me I hated.

40:04.279 --> 40:06.656
Well, Bethany, I, uh,

40:06.740 --> 40:09.409
I-I don't know what to say.

40:11.286 --> 40:14.873
