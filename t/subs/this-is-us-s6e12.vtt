(clears throat)

22:00.820 --> 22:02.655

22:02.739 --> 22:04.657
is that you don't yell
around the kids.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.327
You don't yell around them
and you don't yell at them.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.746
Yeah, don't worry.
British people don't yell.

disapprovingly.

about me. As a dad.

22:24.636 --> 22:27.722
I've heard nothing
but good things as of late.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.642

22:32.060 --> 22:34.270
How do you mean?

22:38.983 --> 22:43.113
I thought if we worked hard,

22:43.196 --> 22:44.989
if we fixed what was broken,

22:45.073 --> 22:46.658
that we would...

22:48.368 --> 22:50.370
...that we would find our way
back to each other.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.622
But instead we got divorced
and, uh,

22:52.706 --> 22:55.041
Kate found her way to you. So...

22:56.668 --> 22:59.170
I-I'm sorry. This is, this is
kind of getting off the rails.

22:59.254 --> 23:02.340
Listen, Toby...

23:02.424 --> 23:07.554
there's not much I can say to
make this moment more palatable.

23:07.637 --> 23:09.556
But I will say...

23:11.558 --> 23:13.643
I love your children.

23:14.686 --> 23:18.314
And I consider it
a great privilege to...

23:18.398 --> 23:21.443

23:39.252 --> 23:40.879

23:40.962 --> 23:43.381

23:43.465 --> 23:45.925
If you want to marry
Kate Pearson, you have to have
