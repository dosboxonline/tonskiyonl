WEBVTT

03:11.931 --> 03:13.098
No!

03:22.858 --> 03:25.193
Get me Agent Chester Desmond

03:25.361 --> 03:27.612
out in Fargo, North Dakota.

03:43.546 --> 03:46.172
James, come over here and help out.

03:46.340 --> 03:48.216
The phone.

03:55.683 --> 03:56.725
Hello.

03:56.934 --> 03:59.686
Chet, I'm calling you
from Portland, Oregon.

03:59.895 --> 04:02.439
It's Regional Bureau Chief
Gordon Cole

04:02.648 --> 04:05.358
calling from Portland, Oregon.

04:05.568 --> 04:08.737
- Okay, Gordon.
- Oregon.

04:09.864 --> 04:13.491
I got a girl that's been murdered.
Seventeen years old.

04:13.701 --> 04:15.785
Named Teresa Banks.

04:16.704 --> 04:18.663
Chet, I've got a surprise for you.

04:18.873 --> 04:21.416
Something interesting
I would like to show you.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.877
Arrangements are being made,

04:24.086 --> 04:28.048
and I will meet you
at the private Portland airport.

04:28.257 --> 04:30.091
Okay, Gordon.

05:03.793 --> 05:05.335
Thanks.

05:08.714 --> 05:12.092
- Chet, good to see you.
- Gordon.

05:12.301 --> 05:14.677
Chet, give Sam Stanley
the glad hand.

05:14.887 --> 05:16.346
He's come over from Spokane.

05:16.555 --> 05:18.681
It's a pleasure.
I've heard a lot about you.

05:18.891 --> 05:21.267
Sam's the man
who cracked the Whiteman case.

05:21.477 --> 05:23.144
Congratulations.

05:23.354 --> 05:25.480
I heard about that.

05:26.148 --> 05:28.942
Chet, your surprise.

05:30.194 --> 05:32.445
Her name is Lil.

05:37.868 --> 05:41.412
She's my mother's sister's girl.

05:42.581 --> 05:44.457
Federal?

05:49.004 --> 05:50.046
Good luck, Chet.

05:51.423 --> 05:52.966
Sam, you stick with Chet.

05:53.175 --> 05:57.846
He's got his own MO,
modus operandi.

05:58.055 --> 06:00.390
You fellas can reach me
in the Philadelphia offices.

06:00.599 --> 06:01.933
I'm flying out today.

06:07.314 --> 06:10.525
That really was something
with the dancing girl, wasn't it?

06:10.734 --> 06:12.610
What exactly did that mean?

06:12.820 --> 06:14.904
I'll explain it to you.

06:15.114 --> 06:17.699
Remember Lil
was wearing a sour face.

06:17.908 --> 06:19.492
What do you mean?

06:21.537 --> 06:23.997
Her face had a sour look on it.

06:26.542 --> 06:29.377
We're gonna have problems
with the local authorities.

06:29.587 --> 06:32.463
They're not gonna be receptive
to the FBI.

06:32.965 --> 06:35.842
Both eyes blinking
means trouble higher up,

06:36.051 --> 06:37.635
the eyes of the local authority.

06:38.387 --> 06:40.471
A sheriff and a deputy
would be my guess.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.515
If you noticed,
she had one hand in her pocket,

06:42.933 --> 06:44.434
which means
they were hiding something,

06:45.394 --> 06:47.061
and the other hand made into a fist,

06:47.271 --> 06:48.980
which means
they're gonna be belligerent.

06:49.523 --> 06:51.232
Lil was walking in place,

06:51.442 --> 06:54.569
which means there's gonna
be a lot of legwork involved.

06:55.571 --> 07:00.158
Cole said Lil was
"his mother's sister's girl."

07:00.367 --> 07:02.202
Now, what's missing
in that sentence?

07:02.912 --> 07:04.412
The uncle.

07:04.580 --> 07:07.874
Not Cole's uncle, but probably
the sheriff's uncle is in federal prison.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.001
Let me ask you something, Stanley.

07:10.211 --> 07:12.629
Did you notice anything
about the dress?

07:12.838 --> 07:14.172
The dress was altered to fit her.

07:14.381 --> 07:18.343
I noticed a different colored thread
where the dress was taken in.

07:19.678 --> 07:21.638
Gordon said you were good.

07:23.307 --> 07:25.725
A tailored dress
is our code for drugs.

07:25.893 --> 07:27.185
Oh.

07:28.062 --> 07:29.395
You notice what was pinned to it?

07:34.735 --> 07:36.402
A blue rose?

07:41.033 --> 07:42.742
Good.

07:43.452 --> 07:45.036
But I can't tell you about that.

07:47.039 --> 07:48.665
You can't?

07:50.501 --> 07:52.585
No, I can't.

08:33.585 --> 08:37.212
Good afternoon.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

08:37.423 --> 08:38.840
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

08:39.049 --> 08:41.717
I'd like to see Sheriff Cable, please.

08:49.727 --> 08:52.186
Why don't you have a seat
over there with your partner?

08:52.396 --> 08:53.730
Go ahead, make yourself at home.

08:53.939 --> 08:55.315
Because it's gonna be a while.

09:08.996 --> 09:11.331
Why don't you have some coffee?
Go ahead.

09:11.540 --> 09:13.291
It was fresh about two days ago.

09:20.841 --> 09:23.009
All right, I've had enough
of the waiting room now.

09:23.218 --> 09:24.761
Oh, is that so?

09:44.156 --> 09:48.201
You can start
that fresh pot of coffee right now.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.878
- How did you get in here?
- Federal Bureau of Investigation.

09:59.088 --> 10:01.589
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

10:02.049 --> 10:04.550
I'm here to investigate
the murder of Teresa Banks.

10:06.220 --> 10:08.721
Well, little fella,

10:09.014 --> 10:12.266
we don't need any
outside help around here.

10:13.435 --> 10:17.313
I don't like you people sniffing
around my neck of the woods.

10:17.523 --> 10:23.528
In fact, when the state boys called me
about a J. Edgar coming up here,

10:23.737 --> 10:26.072
I think I said:

10:26.865 --> 10:28.741
"So what?"

10:32.204 --> 10:33.913
It's all right, deputy.

10:34.123 --> 10:36.749
Sheriff Cable
can handle it from here.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.543
Cliff.

10:44.550 --> 10:47.301
Your behavior is not funny,

10:47.511 --> 10:49.679
and it's wasting the time
of the federal government.

10:51.098 --> 10:54.100
You're lucky I'm not wasting you.

10:55.436 --> 10:58.771
Well, little fella,
let me put it this way.

10:58.981 --> 11:01.315
The operative word here
would be "federal."

11:01.525 --> 11:03.818
I am now ordering you to release
all pertinent information

11:04.027 --> 11:07.613
concerning Teresa Banks,
both while living and deceased.

11:16.957 --> 11:18.958
A basic kill.

11:19.168 --> 11:21.502
Banks was a drifter
and nobody knew her.

11:22.379 --> 11:24.088
Where's the body?

11:25.841 --> 11:28.634
It's out back in our morgue.

11:30.429 --> 11:34.182
It's 4:30. We close at 5.

11:34.391 --> 11:37.852
We have our own clock.
We'll lock up.

12:08.342 --> 12:10.343
You know, Agent Desmond,

12:10.552 --> 12:12.678
I figure this whole office,
furniture included,

12:12.888 --> 12:15.431
is worth 27,000 dollars.

12:33.116 --> 12:35.201
Teresa Banks.

12:35.369 --> 12:39.705
Teresa Banks lived at the
Fat Trout Trailer Park for a month.

12:40.415 --> 12:41.457
We'll check that.

12:42.042 --> 12:43.417
Yeah.

12:43.627 --> 12:46.546
Worked as a waitress
at Hap's Diner.

12:46.755 --> 12:49.257
Worked the night shift.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.842
Good place for dinner
when we're through here, Sam.

12:52.553 --> 12:54.220
Yes.

12:56.723 --> 12:58.683
No one came to claim the body.

13:02.271 --> 13:04.564
No known next of kin.

13:20.914 --> 13:22.582
Crushed skull.

13:23.375 --> 13:26.502
Probable cause: repeated blows
to the back of the head

13:26.712 --> 13:29.463
by a blunt, obtuse-angled object.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.136
I wonder where her ring is.

13:37.472 --> 13:41.225
Personal effects include
a watch, undergarment,

13:41.435 --> 13:43.936
pink waitress uniform.

13:53.113 --> 13:54.989
The ring's missing.

13:57.826 --> 14:00.703
There seems to be
an interesting contusion

14:01.622 --> 14:03.873
under the ring finger
of the left hand.

14:05.792 --> 14:07.001
Accidental?

14:28.565 --> 14:30.483
Agent Desmond,

14:30.692 --> 14:33.319
could you hold the finger
for me, please?

14:37.949 --> 14:39.909
There's something in there.

14:48.126 --> 14:49.627
What is it?

14:51.546 --> 14:53.964
It's a piece of white paper

14:54.925 --> 14:58.386
with the letter "T" imprinted on it.
Come here, take a look.

15:25.789 --> 15:28.124
Agent Desmond,
it's 3:30 in the morning.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.584
Where are we going to sleep?

15:30.794 --> 15:31.961
We're not.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.171
You and I are gonna get some food.

15:37.884 --> 15:39.301
Ask Irene about that.

15:41.012 --> 15:43.013
Irene out there.

15:43.181 --> 15:45.933
Now, Irene is her name,
and it is night.

15:46.143 --> 15:47.935
Don't go any further with it.

15:48.145 --> 15:50.229
There's nothing good about it.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.192
Thank you, Jack.

15:58.572 --> 16:01.407
How's it going
with that goddamn lamp?

16:13.295 --> 16:17.965
Federal Bureau of Investigation,
Special Agent Chet Desmond.

16:20.093 --> 16:22.845
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Teresa Banks.

16:23.263 --> 16:25.264
Jack said you knew her.

16:25.766 --> 16:27.141
How well?

16:31.146 --> 16:33.981
She only worked here a month.

16:34.608 --> 16:36.525
Nice girl.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.821
Never seemed to get here
on time, though.

16:41.114 --> 16:44.325
You ask me,
she had a little problem with:

16:47.537 --> 16:50.873
Did you ever see Teresa Banks
take cocaine?

16:54.044 --> 16:55.711
No.

16:57.005 --> 16:59.089
Do you ever take cocaine, Irene?

16:59.508 --> 17:01.383
No, I do not.

17:01.593 --> 17:05.596
I never took cocaine
or any other drug.

17:05.806 --> 17:07.973
I don't take drugs.

17:08.974 --> 17:10.684
Nicotine's a drug.

17:10.894 --> 17:12.102
Caffeine's a drug.

17:12.979 --> 17:15.105
Who's the toe-head?

17:15.315 --> 17:17.775
Those drugs are legal.

17:18.902 --> 17:20.694
He's with me.

17:22.989 --> 17:26.992
Is there anything you'd like to tell us
about Teresa that might help us out?

17:28.118 --> 17:30.496
I've been thinking about that.

17:31.581 --> 17:33.666
If you ask me,

17:33.875 --> 17:37.670
her death was what you'd call

17:38.713 --> 17:41.507
a freak accident.

17:46.304 --> 17:47.346
Thanks.

17:48.265 --> 17:52.476
Are you talking about that little girl
that got murdered?

17:53.895 --> 17:55.229
You got something to tell us?

17:56.231 --> 17:58.357
I know shit from Shinola.

18:04.322 --> 18:08.492
Agent Desmond, do you think
we should question him?

18:15.292 --> 18:17.001
What time is it, Stanley?

18:22.007 --> 18:23.591
It's late, Sam.

18:23.800 --> 18:26.302
It's late, man. Hey, take... I'm sorry.

18:26.511 --> 18:29.471
It's early. It's really early.

18:29.681 --> 18:33.309
You know, I never told anybody this,

18:34.144 --> 18:37.021
but once for about three days,

18:37.230 --> 18:40.024
just before her time,

18:40.567 --> 18:43.819
Teresa's arm went completely dead.

18:44.487 --> 18:45.529
What do you mean?

18:46.239 --> 18:48.198
Her left arm.

18:48.408 --> 18:50.284
It was numb.

18:50.785 --> 18:53.037
She said she couldn't use it.

18:53.538 --> 18:56.498
Probably those drugs
she was taking.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.544
I just thought I ought to tell you.

19:02.714 --> 19:03.756
Thanks.

19:03.965 --> 19:08.177
Are you talking about that little girl
that got murdered?

19:08.929 --> 19:11.221
I doubt it was a drug problem.

19:11.932 --> 19:14.475
It was probably a nerve problem.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.770
I could recheck the arm for injuries,

19:18.480 --> 19:22.399
but I'd have to take the body back to
Portland to do some real nerve work.

19:23.193 --> 19:26.612
I think that's a good idea, Sam.

19:32.661 --> 19:34.286
Irene?

19:35.747 --> 19:37.498
We'd like to order
some food, please.

19:38.249 --> 19:41.210
You wanna hear about our specials?

19:43.880 --> 19:46.215
We don't have any.

19:56.142 --> 19:57.851
What?

19:58.019 --> 19:59.103
What is it?

20:00.105 --> 20:02.022
- What?
- Nine.

20:02.190 --> 20:03.315
Can't you read?

20:03.483 --> 20:05.067
It's really late. Or really early.

20:05.276 --> 20:07.111
Damn, this better be important.

20:07.278 --> 20:09.363
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

20:09.531 --> 20:11.323
Special Agent Chet Desmond,
Agent Sam Stanley.

20:12.200 --> 20:15.369
Sorry to disturb you, but we need
to see Teresa Banks' trailer, please.

20:15.578 --> 20:17.538
Oh, shit.

20:19.124 --> 20:22.751
That goddamn trailer is more popular
than Uncle's Day in a whorehouse.

20:22.961 --> 20:24.586
You see what I mean?

20:24.796 --> 20:28.799
It just means
more shit I gotta do now.

20:31.970 --> 20:33.595
Damn it.

20:46.860 --> 20:48.736
Everything's exactly like she left it.

20:48.945 --> 20:51.655
I haven't touched a goddamn thing.

20:51.865 --> 20:53.490
God.

21:04.002 --> 21:05.502
Take a look at this.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.427
She's got the ring on.

21:15.638 --> 21:17.890
I'm gonna make myself
a cup of good morning America.

21:18.099 --> 21:20.017
Y'all want some?

21:45.835 --> 21:47.336
Here you go, boys.

21:47.545 --> 21:50.422
- Hey, thanks.
- Good morning America.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.258
Thank you.

21:56.596 --> 21:58.514
- Ahem. You weren't kidding, man.
- Heh, heh.

21:58.681 --> 22:00.557
This stuff's got the sting
of the 48-hour blend.

22:00.725 --> 22:03.560
Ha-ha-ha. That's right.
It's the best goddamn coffee

22:03.728 --> 22:05.062
you're gonna get anywhere, buddy.

22:05.271 --> 22:08.524
We sure do need a good wake-me-up,
don't we, Agent Desmond?

22:09.609 --> 22:11.401
We need a wake-me-up,
don't we, Agent Desmond?

22:11.569 --> 22:13.737
- Yeah, we do, Sam. Ahem.
Ha-ha-ha.

22:13.905 --> 22:15.280
Mm.

22:41.266 --> 22:42.891
Did you know Teresa Banks?

23:34.402 --> 23:37.487
You see, I've already gone places.

23:39.115 --> 23:40.449
I...

23:40.992 --> 23:42.409
I ju...

23:43.453 --> 23:45.954
I just wanna stay where I am.

24:16.903 --> 24:20.197
What the hell
is that thing doing out there?

24:22.158 --> 24:25.535
You're not taking that body
anywhere.

24:29.415 --> 24:31.708
We're taking the body
back to Portland.

24:31.918 --> 24:34.544
There's not a thing
you can do about it.

24:40.301 --> 24:42.636
Teresa Banks had a ring.

24:42.845 --> 24:45.138
Any idea what happened to it?

24:48.726 --> 24:52.187
We got a phone here.
That's got a little ring.

25:05.118 --> 25:07.703
Take the van
back to Portland, Stanley.

25:07.912 --> 25:10.580
I'm gonna take one more look
at the trailer park.

25:10.790 --> 25:12.708
Agent Desmond,

25:13.626 --> 25:17.921
one thing has been troubling me:
the blue rose.

25:18.673 --> 25:22.175
You're going back to the trailer park
for the blue rose.

25:30.476 --> 25:32.894
That's Deputy Cliff's trailer right there,
by that red truck.

25:33.855 --> 25:36.189
- That's his truck too.
- Right.

25:36.357 --> 25:38.900
Now, Teresa Bank's trailer's
over here.

25:39.110 --> 25:40.152
Right where we left it.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.487
Where's my goddamn hot water?

25:42.655 --> 25:44.489
Do you see what I mean?

25:44.949 --> 25:46.950
Ahem. I'll be in my trailer,
if you need me.

25:47.118 --> 25:51.079
- Hot water, Carl.
- I wanna get you some Valium.

27:30.430 --> 27:35.600
Gordon, it's 10:10 a.m.
on February 16th.

27:39.355 --> 27:42.899
I was worried about today
because of the dream I told you about.

28:44.086 --> 28:50.133
Gordon?

28:51.719 --> 28:54.471
Phillip, is that you?

28:55.556 --> 28:57.098
Phillip?

28:57.600 --> 29:00.769
Cooper,
meet the long-lost Phillip Jeffries.

29:00.937 --> 29:03.688
You may have heard of him
from the academy.

29:05.942 --> 29:07.651
Well, now,

29:08.236 --> 29:09.861
I'm not going to talk about Judy.

29:10.071 --> 29:12.739
In fact, we're not going
to talk about Judy at all.

29:12.949 --> 29:14.699
- We're gonna keep her out of it.
- Gordon.

29:14.909 --> 29:15.951
I know, Coop.

29:17.036 --> 29:20.038
Who do you think this is there?

29:20.248 --> 29:21.998
Suffered some bumps
on the old noggin, Phil?

29:22.208 --> 29:24.167
What the hell did he say there,
Albert?

29:24.377 --> 29:26.503
That's Special Agent Dale Cooper.

29:26.712 --> 29:29.422
For God's sakes, Jeffries,
where the hell have you been?

29:29.632 --> 29:31.716
You've been gone
damn near two years.

29:32.176 --> 29:34.344
I sure as hell
wanna tell you everything.

29:34.512 --> 29:36.012
But I haven't got a whole lot
to go on.

29:43.771 --> 29:45.897
Oh, believe me, I followed.

29:51.612 --> 29:53.780
It was a dream.

29:53.948 --> 29:58.451
We live inside a dream.

30:15.303 --> 30:18.346
- The ring. Ring.
- Ha-ha-ha!

30:18.514 --> 30:21.683
It was above a convenience store.

30:29.692 --> 30:31.318
Listen up, and listen carefully.

30:31.485 --> 30:33.486
I've been to one of their meetings.

30:40.453 --> 30:45.123
Hell, God, baby, damn, no.
I found something.

30:48.836 --> 30:51.796
And then there they were.

31:06.062 --> 31:08.188
He's gone. He's gone.

31:08.356 --> 31:09.856
Albert, call the front desk.

31:10.066 --> 31:12.484
I've got the front desk now.
He was never here.

31:12.693 --> 31:14.152
And news from Deer Meadow.

31:14.362 --> 31:16.696
Agent Chester Desmond
has disappeared.

31:16.906 --> 31:19.991
Gordon, what's going on?

31:23.996 --> 31:25.914
He was here.

31:27.166 --> 31:28.792
But where did he go?

31:30.044 --> 31:33.004
And where is Chester Desmond?

31:36.926 --> 31:39.928
That's her trailer over there,
and I never touched a goddamn thing.

31:40.513 --> 31:43.765
Agent Chet Desmond
come by a second time

31:43.974 --> 31:47.102
and asked to see
Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer over here,

31:47.311 --> 31:48.978
which I showed him.

31:49.188 --> 31:53.733
Then I went back to my trailer,
and after that, never saw him again.

31:53.943 --> 31:54.984
Thank you, Carl.

31:55.194 --> 31:57.946
- Sorry to wake you.
- It's all right.

31:58.531 --> 32:00.448
I was having a bad dream, anyway.

32:01.367 --> 32:05.662
That's not the way out
to Deputy Cliff's trailer, I told you.

32:05.871 --> 32:07.622
I'm not going to Deputy Cliff's trailer.

32:07.832 --> 32:09.457
Well, where the hell are you going?

32:11.043 --> 32:13.128
I'm going over here.

32:14.505 --> 32:15.964
What's over there?

32:16.173 --> 32:19.342
Goddamn,
these people are confusing.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.728
What are you looking for?

32:31.605 --> 32:33.898
What was here, Mr. Rodd?

32:34.358 --> 32:37.819
Well, a trailer was here.
What the hell do you think?

32:38.320 --> 32:41.781
Can you tell me whose trailer it was
and who stayed in it?

32:43.409 --> 32:46.661
An old woman and her grandson.

32:46.871 --> 32:49.122
Can you tell me
what their names were?

32:50.291 --> 32:52.041
Chalfont.

32:52.960 --> 32:54.794
As a matter of fact,

32:55.004 --> 32:59.632
Chalfont was the name of the people
that rented this space before.

32:59.842 --> 33:02.010
Two Chalfonts.

33:02.553 --> 33:04.471
Weird, huh?

33:06.265 --> 33:08.933
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?

33:11.145 --> 33:14.272
Yep. Sure is.

33:31.415 --> 33:33.833
Diane, it's 4:20 p.m.

33:34.001 --> 33:36.002
I'm standing here at Wind River,
near the location

33:36.212 --> 33:38.880
where the body
of Teresa Banks was found.

33:39.089 --> 33:42.717
Diane, this case
gives me a strange feeling.

33:42.927 --> 33:46.638
Not only has Special Agent Chester
Desmond disappeared without a trace,

33:46.847 --> 33:49.891
but this is one of Cole's
blue rose cases.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.852
The clues that were found by Special
Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley

33:53.062 --> 33:54.896
have led to dead ends.

33:55.105 --> 33:58.024
The letter that was extracted from
beneath the fingernail of Teresa Banks

33:58.234 --> 34:01.444
gives me the feeling
that the killer will strike again.

34:01.654 --> 34:06.574
But like the song goes,
who knows where or when?

34:29.889 --> 34:31.933
Donna.

34:33.686 --> 34:35.812
Just a minute, Laura.

34:47.366 --> 34:48.908
Hi.

34:59.670 --> 35:02.547
Yeah, Mike, you're the real man.

35:02.756 --> 35:05.425
That's right. Mike is the man.

35:05.634 --> 35:09.220
- Mike is the man.
- Is the man.

35:10.306 --> 35:14.100
Laura Palmer, see you later.

35:17.229 --> 35:18.730
Laura.

35:32.119 --> 35:33.995
See you in a sec.

36:27.967 --> 36:29.801
Hey, baby.

36:35.140 --> 36:36.933
Just kiss me.

36:37.142 --> 36:38.893
It does matter.

36:39.103 --> 36:40.853
We're in love.

36:41.063 --> 36:44.190
James, you don't know
what you're talking about.

36:45.150 --> 36:48.653
Quit trying to hold on so tight.

36:49.154 --> 36:50.488
I'm gone.

36:50.698 --> 36:52.615
Long gone.

36:52.825 --> 36:55.410
Like a turkey in the corn.

36:57.871 --> 36:59.998
You're not a turkey.

37:04.586 --> 37:08.089
A turkey's one of the
dumbest birds on Earth.

37:22.604 --> 37:25.940
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

37:34.783 --> 37:36.743
Don't ever leave.

37:38.996 --> 37:41.164
Laura, don't ever leave.

37:44.001 --> 37:46.461
I'll never leave you.

38:17.951 --> 38:22.455
Hey, where were you for the last hour?
I've been looking all over for you.

38:23.290 --> 38:26.918
I was standing right behind you,
but you're too dumb to turn around.

38:28.629 --> 38:30.797
If he turned around,
he might get dizzy and fall down.

38:31.006 --> 38:32.048
Where were you?

38:32.257 --> 38:34.217
I'm not kidding around.

38:34.426 --> 38:35.676
Who were you with?

38:36.136 --> 38:38.137
Get lost, Bobby.

38:38.889 --> 38:40.389
Oh, yeah?

38:40.599 --> 38:43.684
You'll be calling soon
and maybe I won't be around.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.234
Come on, Bobby.

38:53.737 --> 38:55.196
Come on.

38:55.405 --> 38:56.614
Just a little one?

38:59.201 --> 39:00.743
Come on.

39:06.458 --> 39:08.251
Love you, babe.

39:41.660 --> 39:44.036
Are you gonna see James tonight?

39:46.665 --> 39:50.877
Why are you suddenly so interested
in who I'm going to see at night?

39:53.005 --> 39:55.047
Nighttime is my time.

39:55.257 --> 39:57.300
You're telling me.

39:57.509 --> 40:00.761
That's only because
you won't let me in on any of it.

40:02.639 --> 40:05.057
You're not gonna see Bobby,
are you?

40:07.019 --> 40:08.603
Maybe.

40:08.812 --> 40:11.272
My God, Laura.

40:12.900 --> 40:14.734
Well, why not?

40:14.943 --> 40:18.529
Because Bobby is a loser.
You said so yourself.

40:18.739 --> 40:20.198
He's a goon.

40:25.120 --> 40:27.246
James is the one.

40:29.958 --> 40:33.211
He loves you
with that everlasting love.

40:34.004 --> 40:35.796
True love.

40:39.343 --> 40:42.261
Yes, James is very sweet.

40:43.222 --> 40:46.307
Why don't you get out
your violin, Donna?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.434
"Sweet"?

40:49.811 --> 40:52.396
God, he's gorgeous.

40:54.399 --> 40:57.735
Yes, James is very sweet

40:57.945 --> 41:00.905
and very gorgeous.

41:05.035 --> 41:08.454
I wonder if Mike
could ever write a poem.

41:22.511 --> 41:26.180
Do you think
that if you were falling in space

41:27.224 --> 41:31.352
that you would slow down
after a while or go faster and faster?

41:39.027 --> 41:41.612
Faster and faster.

41:44.074 --> 41:47.827
And for a long time,
you wouldn't feel anything.

41:49.997 --> 41:53.332
And then you'd burst into fire.

41:56.003 --> 41:57.586
Forever.

42:03.927 --> 42:07.221
And the angels wouldn't help you.

42:12.019 --> 42:15.229
Because they've all gone away.

42:33.665 --> 42:35.374
Mom?

44:05.132 --> 44:06.632
Mm-hm.

44:07.509 --> 44:09.051
Laura.

44:13.432 --> 44:17.268
My secret diary,
there are pages missing.

44:18.687 --> 44:20.104
Well, who would do that?

44:20.313 --> 44:21.939
Bob.

44:22.899 --> 44:25.776
But Bob is not real.

44:26.695 --> 44:30.739
There are pages torn out.
That is real, Harold.

44:30.949 --> 44:35.327
Okay, okay, well, maybe, maybe.
Okay.

44:36.079 --> 44:38.914
Bob is real.

44:40.834 --> 44:43.878
He's been having me
since I was 12.

44:46.131 --> 44:47.465
And the diary was hidden too well.

44:47.674 --> 44:51.760
There is no other person
who could've known where it was.

44:54.306 --> 44:57.892
He comes in
through my window at night.

45:00.479 --> 45:02.271
He's real.

45:02.481 --> 45:04.899
He's getting to know me now.

45:05.400 --> 45:07.526
He speaks to me.

45:08.445 --> 45:10.529
What does Bob say?

45:13.450 --> 45:17.369
He says he wants
to be me or he'll kill me.

45:19.706 --> 45:22.625
- No. No.
- Yes.

45:23.418 --> 45:25.085
Yes.

45:25.629 --> 45:27.838
What? What? Please, what?

45:28.715 --> 45:32.468
Fire walk

45:32.677 --> 45:35.137
with me.

45:36.264 --> 45:37.556
Me.

45:47.651 --> 45:48.692
Oh, the trees.

45:49.611 --> 45:51.570
The trees.

45:52.322 --> 45:55.199
You have to hide the diary, Harold.

45:55.408 --> 45:58.118
You made me write it all down.

45:58.828 --> 46:00.829
He doesn't know about you.

46:01.039 --> 46:03.040
You'll be safe.

46:06.836 --> 46:08.671
I'm sorry.

46:36.950 --> 46:38.284
Laura.

46:38.868 --> 46:40.411
What?

46:48.712 --> 46:51.589
I don't know when I can come back.

46:52.424 --> 46:54.383
Maybe never.

47:00.348 --> 47:05.394
Laura.

47:09.941 --> 47:16.363
I want to taste through your mouth.

47:18.658 --> 47:20.242
No.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.667
Lately, I've been filled
with the knowledge

47:28.877 --> 47:30.210
that the killer will strike again.

47:30.420 --> 47:33.881
But because it is just a feeling,
I am powerless to stop it.

47:34.799 --> 47:36.759
One more thing, Albert.

47:36.968 --> 47:38.927
When the next murder happens,

47:39.137 --> 47:41.347
you will help me solve it.

47:42.557 --> 47:44.600
Let's test it for the record.

47:46.269 --> 47:48.187
Will the next victim
be a man or a woman?

47:49.564 --> 47:51.315
A woman.

47:51.941 --> 47:53.484
All right.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.529
What color hair will she have?

47:59.532 --> 48:00.824
Blond.

48:01.368 --> 48:03.452
Tell me some other things
about her.

48:04.120 --> 48:05.954
She's in high school.

48:06.623 --> 48:08.832
She is sexually active.

48:09.876 --> 48:11.960
She's using drugs.

48:13.922 --> 48:15.881
She's crying out for help.

48:17.676 --> 48:19.218
Well, damn,
that really narrows it down.

48:19.427 --> 48:22.721
You're talking about half
the high school girls in America.

48:23.723 --> 48:25.432
What's she doing right now?

48:27.143 --> 48:31.146
She's preparing
a great abundance of food.

48:39.447 --> 48:42.157
Okay, here's your change.
Thank you.

48:42.367 --> 48:45.244
- Heidi's got a bloody nose.
- Bloody nose?

48:45.412 --> 48:47.246
Do you think
you could give Laura a hand

48:47.414 --> 48:48.622
with the Meals on Wheels?

48:48.790 --> 48:52.084
Um, I was just... I was busy.
I was doing this.

48:53.920 --> 48:55.587
You're not that busy.

49:37.964 --> 49:40.966
This would look nice on your wall.

50:01.321 --> 50:03.822
- Shelly?
- Yeah?

50:04.699 --> 50:08.202
Um... I can't do
the Meals on Wheels today.

50:08.828 --> 50:11.079
I just... I just can't.

50:11.289 --> 50:12.998
What?

52:11.492 --> 52:13.744
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

52:16.414 --> 52:20.542
No. No. No. No, no, no. No.

52:22.253 --> 52:25.923
No. No. No.

52:28.635 --> 52:30.010
No, not him.

52:30.219 --> 52:32.304
No. No, it's not him. It's not...

52:32.513 --> 52:36.600
It's not... No, it's not him. No.

52:40.021 --> 52:41.313
Laura.

52:43.608 --> 52:45.776
Donna, are you...?

52:45.985 --> 52:47.194
Are you my...?

52:47.403 --> 52:49.613
Are you my best friend?

52:49.822 --> 52:51.031
Of course.

52:51.783 --> 52:54.326
What is it, Laura? What's wrong?

53:05.630 --> 53:08.423
I'm your friend always.

53:12.929 --> 53:15.055
Come on.

53:46.254 --> 53:47.921
Hi, honey.

53:49.215 --> 53:50.924
How's Donna?

53:51.134 --> 53:52.718
Fine.

53:53.219 --> 53:54.970
School?

53:55.179 --> 53:56.638
School's fine.

53:56.848 --> 54:10.193
Sit down.

54:17.201 --> 54:18.493
Are you hungry?

54:19.620 --> 54:21.329
Not really.

54:22.123 --> 54:23.623
Hmm.

54:30.506 --> 54:33.633
You didn't wash your hands before
you sat down to dinner, did you?

54:41.184 --> 54:42.851
Let me see.

54:43.436 --> 54:45.062
Dad.

54:47.315 --> 54:49.941
Oh, these hands are filthy.

54:52.445 --> 54:54.196
Look.

54:55.156 --> 54:58.366
There's dirt
way under this fingernail.

55:03.331 --> 55:05.373
- Leland, what are you doing?
- Look at this finger.

55:05.583 --> 55:07.209
- Leland...
- Laura did not wash her hands

55:07.418 --> 55:08.877
before dinner.

55:09.087 --> 55:11.254
- Oh, look at this.
- Don't.

55:12.799 --> 55:14.841
Oh.

55:15.343 --> 55:16.885
Is it from a lover?

55:20.473 --> 55:21.890
Did you get this from your lover?

55:22.767 --> 55:25.644
They don't call them "lovers"
in high school, Leland.

55:26.020 --> 55:27.729
Bobby didn't give you this.

55:28.564 --> 55:30.941
How do you know that Bobby
didn't give her that?

55:31.609 --> 55:33.443
Did Bobby give you this?

55:33.653 --> 55:35.695
Or is there someone new?

55:36.823 --> 55:38.740
Leland.

55:38.908 --> 55:41.159
Leave her alone. Don't do that.
She doesn't like that.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.620
How do you know what she likes?

55:44.372 --> 55:50.043
Stop it!

56:08.771 --> 56:11.022
Now, you sit down,

56:11.607 --> 56:12.732
and we'll all have dinner.

56:14.527 --> 56:16.444
Oh, I'll sit down.

56:16.904 --> 56:18.864
But not a one of us
is going to start eating

56:19.073 --> 56:21.366
until Laura washes her hands.

56:24.120 --> 56:25.954
Wash your hands.

57:47.078 --> 57:49.079
What is it, Leland?

57:53.709 --> 57:55.543
Laura, honey.

58:09.267 --> 58:11.017
I love you.

58:14.563 --> 58:17.274
I love you so much.

58:18.359 --> 58:20.110
Dad.

58:33.124 --> 58:35.250
Good night, princess.

59:11.871 --> 59:14.247
Is it true?

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:22.685
Don't take the ring, Laura.

01:02:23.562 --> 01:02:26.272
Don't take the ring.

01:02:57.429 --> 01:02:59.722
My name is Annie.

01:02:59.932 --> 01:03:02.684
I've been with Dale and Laura.

01:03:02.893 --> 01:03:04.811
The good Dale is in the lodge,

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.438
and he can't leave.

01:03:07.648 --> 01:03:09.941
Write it in your diary.

01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:17.068
This is where we live, Shelly!

01:05:17.486 --> 01:05:19.404
As if I didn't know.

01:05:19.738 --> 01:05:22.949
I'm gonna show you how to wash
this tile, and then you're gonna do it.

01:05:23.158 --> 01:05:25.368
Come off it, Leo.
I have to get ready for work.

01:05:25.577 --> 01:05:27.453
What did you say?

01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:30.581
Shelly,
I'm not fooling around anymore!

01:05:30.791 --> 01:05:32.333
- Okay.
- First thing you're gonna learn

01:05:32.543 --> 01:05:35.211
is to have a good attitude.
That's the key!

01:05:35.421 --> 01:05:36.921
Anybody will tell you that.

01:05:39.133 --> 01:05:40.508
Ow!

01:05:41.093 --> 01:05:42.552
Don't even think about
going anywhere.

01:05:42.761 --> 01:05:44.679
I'm not finished with you.

01:05:47.099 --> 01:05:49.726
- Yeah?
- Leo, Bobby.

01:05:50.144 --> 01:05:51.769
What are you doing
calling me here?

01:05:52.354 --> 01:05:54.272
I'm sorry. Um...

01:05:55.274 --> 01:05:57.900
The football's empty.
I'm looking for Santa Claus.

01:05:58.110 --> 01:06:00.486
No way.
You already owe me money.

01:06:00.696 --> 01:06:04.490
- Five thousand, to be exact.
- Five thousand?

01:06:04.658 --> 01:06:05.908
Leo Johnson,

01:06:06.577 --> 01:06:09.120
are you telling me
there's no Santa Claus?

01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:16.586
Yeah, Roadhouse.

01:06:17.463 --> 01:06:19.547
Jacques, Bobby.

01:06:20.841 --> 01:06:22.884
I need some things, man.

01:06:23.343 --> 01:06:24.594
Heh.

01:06:24.762 --> 01:06:27.638
How come you only call me
when you're desperate?

01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:29.557
You desperate, baby?

01:06:30.476 --> 01:06:32.226
Are you interested or not?

01:06:32.436 --> 01:06:34.896
Yeah, maybe, Bobby, baby.

01:06:35.105 --> 01:06:37.440
Maybe. Heh.

01:06:39.067 --> 01:06:41.903
For 10 K, I have a friend
who has what you want.

01:06:42.112 --> 01:06:44.030
Oh, his stuff is the best.

01:06:45.783 --> 01:06:47.450
Hit me.

01:06:49.953 --> 01:06:52.121
Two days, midnight,

01:06:52.331 --> 01:06:55.750
at the sound of sawing wood.

01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:00.671
Jacques,
you crazy fucking Canadian.

01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:02.882
This sounds big.

01:07:30.577 --> 01:07:32.286
Laura?

01:07:32.454 --> 01:07:39.794
Laura?

01:07:45.968 --> 01:07:48.135
Where you going?

01:07:48.345 --> 01:07:50.930
Nowhere fast.

01:07:51.431 --> 01:07:53.766
And you're not coming.

01:07:55.561 --> 01:07:57.144
Laura, come on.

01:07:57.729 --> 01:08:00.606
You remember me?
I'm your best friend.

01:08:11.118 --> 01:08:12.869
Laura...

01:08:14.788 --> 01:08:17.497
...aren't you gonna fix me a drink?

01:08:26.008 --> 01:08:28.259
Where are the cookies?

01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:31.345
You mean Fred and Ginger?

01:08:32.514 --> 01:08:34.432
Dancing.

01:08:37.352 --> 01:08:40.313
If I had a nickel for every cigarette
your mom smoked,

01:08:40.522 --> 01:08:42.564
I'd be dead.

01:08:50.365 --> 01:08:52.658
I'll call you tomorrow.

01:08:55.912 --> 01:08:57.705
Laura.

01:08:58.999 --> 01:09:00.541
Laura.

01:09:32.573 --> 01:09:38.703
When this kind of fire starts,
it is very hard to put out.

01:09:39.581 --> 01:09:43.709
The tender bows of innocence
burn first,

01:09:43.919 --> 01:09:46.295
and the wind rises.

01:09:46.712 --> 01:09:48.381
And then

01:09:49.006 --> 01:09:51.968
all goodness is in jeopardy.

01:10:19.496 --> 01:10:25.793
Why did you go?

01:10:26.169 --> 01:10:33.175
Why did you turn

01:10:33.593 --> 01:10:40.182
Away from me?

01:10:42.352 --> 01:10:47.273
When all the world

01:10:47.482 --> 01:10:51.902
Seemed to sing

01:10:52.112 --> 01:10:54.947
Why

01:10:55.157 --> 01:11:02.163
Why did you go?

01:11:03.957 --> 01:11:07.043
Was it me?

01:11:07.252 --> 01:11:10.755
Was it you?

01:11:10.964 --> 01:11:16.343
Questions in a world

01:11:16.553 --> 01:11:23.225
Of blue

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:30.816
How can a heart

01:11:32.527 --> 01:11:39.533
That's filled with love

01:11:40.869 --> 01:11:46.290
Start to cry?

01:11:48.585 --> 01:11:53.589
When all the world

01:11:53.799 --> 01:11:58.094
Seemed so right

01:11:58.303 --> 01:12:01.347
How

01:12:01.556 --> 01:12:08.562
How can love die?

01:12:10.524 --> 01:12:13.484
Was it me?

01:12:13.693 --> 01:12:16.237
Was it you?

01:12:17.239 --> 01:12:22.576
Questions in a world

01:12:22.786 --> 01:12:28.082
Of blue

01:12:55.485 --> 01:13:02.491
When did the day

01:13:03.827 --> 01:13:10.833
With all its light

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:17.256
Turn into night?

01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:26.348
When all the world seemed to...

01:13:26.558 --> 01:13:29.059
So you wanna fuck
the homecoming queen?

01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:32.980
Let's go around the world, babe.

01:13:33.148 --> 01:13:37.026
Why did you go?

01:13:37.194 --> 01:13:40.070
This isn't gonna get you
to Walla Walla.

01:13:40.864 --> 01:13:45.117
You do go all the way,
don't you, little girl?

01:13:45.285 --> 01:13:47.745
Was it you?

01:13:47.913 --> 01:13:49.246
Sooner or later.

01:13:49.456 --> 01:13:52.875
Questions in a world...

01:13:53.293 --> 01:13:55.961
You willing to go all the way, huh?

01:13:56.338 --> 01:13:58.589
You gonna do it to me?

01:14:03.678 --> 01:14:10.434
Questions in a world of blue

01:14:10.602 --> 01:14:12.895
Let's boogie.

01:14:13.146 --> 01:14:15.648
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.192
Are you part of the deal?

01:14:18.401 --> 01:14:19.985
No, she isn't.

01:15:06.366 --> 01:15:08.367
What did you say your name was?

01:15:09.411 --> 01:15:10.828
Buck. Heh.

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.332
That was really nice, Buck.

01:15:33.018 --> 01:15:36.270
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

01:15:40.859 --> 01:15:42.568
Okay, Donna.

01:15:43.528 --> 01:15:45.279
Let's go.

01:18:29.402 --> 01:18:30.986
Yeah.

01:23:26.699 --> 01:23:31.119
No! Donna!

01:23:31.329 --> 01:23:33.163
Donna!

01:23:43.758 --> 01:23:45.842
Get off her.

01:23:48.971 --> 01:23:53.183
Don't ever wear my stuff!
Don't ever wear my stuff! Never!

01:23:53.392 --> 01:23:57.229
- I won't wear your stuff.
- Jacques, help me get her home now!

01:23:57.396 --> 01:24:01.399
- Tommy!
- I'm not gonna wear your stuff.

01:24:02.735 --> 01:24:04.778
Donna, not you.

01:24:56.163 --> 01:24:58.832
How did I get in my house?

01:25:00.501 --> 01:25:02.419
How did I get in my bed?

01:25:04.005 --> 01:25:07.632
Life is full of mysteries, Donna.

01:25:09.135 --> 01:25:12.512
Were you mad at me
for wearing something of yours?

01:25:14.265 --> 01:25:17.017
I don't want you to wear my stuff.

01:25:23.065 --> 01:25:25.567
I do love you, Laura.

01:25:33.826 --> 01:25:36.369
I love you, Donna.

01:25:41.626 --> 01:25:44.419
But I don't want you to be like me.

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.595
Why do you do it?

01:26:16.327 --> 01:26:17.410
Excuse me, honey.

01:26:20.289 --> 01:26:22.415
We're late to meet Mom
for breakfast.

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.584
I'll catch you later.

01:26:30.091 --> 01:26:33.176
- Bye-bye, Donna.
- Bye.

01:27:07.378 --> 01:27:09.963
Dad, is the engine on fire?

01:27:10.548 --> 01:27:12.090
It smells like something's burning.

01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:35.822
- Something is burning!
- It's the engine.

01:27:36.032 --> 01:27:38.575
You stole the corn!

01:27:39.118 --> 01:27:43.955
I had it canned over the store!

01:27:44.165 --> 01:27:47.667
And, miss, the look on her face

01:27:47.877 --> 01:27:53.214
when it was opened.
There was a stillness.

01:27:54.675 --> 01:27:57.510
Like the Formica tabletop.

01:27:58.345 --> 01:28:01.681
The thread will be torn, Mr. Palmer.

01:28:02.308 --> 01:28:03.933
Come on!

01:28:04.143 --> 01:28:06.394
The thread will be torn!

01:28:09.023 --> 01:28:12.525
- It's him! It's your father!
- Aah!

01:28:13.194 --> 01:28:15.403
Stop it!

01:28:18.949 --> 01:28:21.326
What was that all about?

01:28:28.501 --> 01:28:30.585
Mister, mister,
don't do that to your engine.

01:28:30.795 --> 01:28:32.462
You ought to take it easy, mister.

01:28:32.671 --> 01:28:35.548
You're going to
burn your engine out.

01:28:35.758 --> 01:28:37.717
What the hell was all that about?

01:28:37.927 --> 01:28:39.928
Why doesn't somebody
do something about this?

01:28:40.137 --> 01:28:41.930
A man comes out of the blue
like that,

01:28:42.139 --> 01:28:44.516
starts screaming at you
like a crazy person

01:28:44.725 --> 01:28:46.267
and harassing my daughter.

01:28:46.477 --> 01:28:49.687
- You all right, honey?
- Dad, are you all right?

01:28:59.323 --> 01:29:00.824
Teresa Banks.

01:29:01.408 --> 01:29:03.284
You look just like my Laura.

01:29:06.705 --> 01:29:09.207
So when's the next business trip,
big boy?

01:29:09.416 --> 01:29:11.000
Soon.

01:29:11.210 --> 01:29:15.797
And next time, let's party with those
girlfriends you told me about.

01:29:17.424 --> 01:29:19.926
- Huh?
- Sure.

01:29:20.094 --> 01:29:21.928
I can arrange that.

01:29:30.146 --> 01:29:31.938
What are you doing?

01:29:32.898 --> 01:29:34.732
Who am I?

01:29:36.777 --> 01:29:38.528
I don't know.

01:29:39.029 --> 01:29:40.363
That's right.

01:29:40.573 --> 01:29:41.990
Dad?

01:29:43.284 --> 01:29:44.909
- Dad?
- Aah.

01:29:46.245 --> 01:29:48.830
Who was that?

01:29:49.957 --> 01:29:53.710
He looked familiar. Have I met him?

01:29:53.919 --> 01:29:55.962
No, honey, you haven't met him.
Have you met him?

01:29:56.172 --> 01:29:57.463
No.

01:29:59.008 --> 01:30:00.049
Let's go get your mother.

01:30:00.259 --> 01:30:04.095
No, no, just sit here for a moment.

01:30:05.097 --> 01:30:07.056
Oh, my God.

01:30:09.435 --> 01:30:11.519
I mean, a man
comes out of the blue like that.

01:30:11.729 --> 01:30:13.938
What's the world coming to?

01:30:37.588 --> 01:30:39.881
- Hey, handsome.
- Hi.

01:30:41.759 --> 01:30:44.010
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:30:44.428 --> 01:30:46.429
I chickened out.

01:31:22.508 --> 01:31:25.134
Are you sure you're okay?

01:31:25.344 --> 01:31:26.511
Yes.

01:31:28.847 --> 01:31:30.265
Ah.

01:31:41.277 --> 01:31:42.527
Dad?

01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:44.612
Yes.

01:31:47.324 --> 01:31:50.285
Did you come home
during the day last week?

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:56.582
No.

01:31:58.627 --> 01:32:00.044
Leave us alone!

01:32:00.254 --> 01:32:02.380
Goddamn it, get back to your work!

01:32:18.272 --> 01:32:21.524
I thought I saw you.

01:32:25.154 --> 01:32:27.572
Oh, God. You know,

01:32:28.699 --> 01:32:32.243
I did stop home on Friday,
come to think of it.

01:32:33.162 --> 01:32:35.747
I had this severe headache,
and I was in the neighborhood,

01:32:35.956 --> 01:32:38.708
so I darted in and out of the house

01:32:38.917 --> 01:32:40.793
to get some aspirin.

01:32:42.129 --> 01:32:43.588
Where were you, Laura?

01:32:44.048 --> 01:32:46.007
I didn't see you.

01:32:49.762 --> 01:32:51.387
Um...

01:32:52.473 --> 01:32:54.932
I was just down the street.

01:32:56.226 --> 01:32:57.602
Yeah.

01:33:39.395 --> 01:33:41.687
The same ring.

01:33:54.827 --> 01:33:57.703
Who are you?

01:33:57.913 --> 01:34:01.207
Who are you really?

01:35:07.107 --> 01:35:08.441
Hey.

01:35:08.650 --> 01:35:10.443
I'm nearly out.

01:35:10.652 --> 01:35:14.947
It's taken care of, babe. You and I
are going to make a big score tonight.

01:35:15.157 --> 01:35:17.158
What is that?

01:35:17.367 --> 01:35:18.826
This should tide you over.

01:35:19.036 --> 01:35:20.953
Bobby.

01:35:22.664 --> 01:35:24.624
Thanks.

01:35:24.833 --> 01:35:27.210
A big score?

01:35:27.419 --> 01:35:29.420
Maybe our biggest.

01:35:29.630 --> 01:35:34.217
Don't tell Mike.
This is just between you and me.

01:35:34.426 --> 01:35:39.096
Tonight, meet me two doors
down from your place at 11.

01:35:41.266 --> 01:35:43.226
Midnight.

01:35:43.435 --> 01:35:46.229
Near the sound of sawing wood.

01:35:55.781 --> 01:35:57.907
Do you love me, Laura?

01:35:58.408 --> 01:36:01.452
- Bobby? Watch.
- Huh?

01:36:01.620 --> 01:36:03.454
Okay, watch.

01:36:05.207 --> 01:36:07.333
- Ha-ha-ha.
- That's good, Laura.

01:36:07.501 --> 01:36:09.794
That's really good.
You're a great dancer.

01:36:21.056 --> 01:36:23.558
Whoo!

01:36:31.066 --> 01:36:33.693
Ooh. Whoa.

01:36:40.701 --> 01:36:42.702
Come on, knock it off.

01:36:43.704 --> 01:36:45.997
Knock it the fuck off.

01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:56.007
- Give me the fucking...
- Okay, okay.

01:36:58.093 --> 01:37:01.012
Give me the fucking bottle. Shh.

01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:23.909
Bubby? I mean, Bobby?

01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.040
I found a little pinecone. Ha-ha-ha.

01:37:29.207 --> 01:37:32.209
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

01:37:32.419 --> 01:37:35.171
- Bobby, I found some dirt.
- Shut up. Shut up.

01:37:36.798 --> 01:37:38.883
Shut up.

01:37:39.092 --> 01:37:41.594
- I found some dirt.
- Here he comes.

01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:45.097
Here he comes.

01:37:52.939 --> 01:37:54.607
Come on.

01:38:02.115 --> 01:38:03.658
Who sent you?

01:38:03.867 --> 01:38:05.451
Jacques.

01:38:06.536 --> 01:38:08.371
That's right.

01:38:11.792 --> 01:38:14.502
- Oh.
- Wow.

01:38:18.131 --> 01:38:21.258
Like that, little girl? Huh?

01:38:22.886 --> 01:38:23.969
What?

01:38:34.147 --> 01:38:35.314
Oh, my God!

01:38:39.695 --> 01:38:43.280
Oh, my God.
Bobby, what did you do?

01:38:44.658 --> 01:38:47.535
I shot him. Oh, my God.

01:38:48.203 --> 01:38:51.038
I shot him. Fuck.

01:38:59.965 --> 01:39:02.633
Get over here and help me!

01:39:03.593 --> 01:39:05.594
Come here!

01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:12.017
Fuck.

01:39:29.161 --> 01:39:31.829
Shut the fuck up.
This isn't funny, Laura.

01:39:32.038 --> 01:39:34.165
This is not fucking funny.

01:39:34.374 --> 01:39:36.083
Now, help me bury him.

01:39:42.632 --> 01:39:44.258
Shit.

01:39:45.218 --> 01:39:47.011
Bobby, you killed Mike.

01:39:47.220 --> 01:39:49.597
This isn't fucking Mike!

01:39:57.606 --> 01:39:59.565
Is this Mike?

01:40:10.494 --> 01:40:13.412
Bobby, do you realize what you did?

01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:18.292
You killed Mike.

01:40:18.502 --> 01:40:20.503
Shut up.

01:40:32.766 --> 01:40:34.350
Bobby.

01:40:41.483 --> 01:40:43.692
Bobby, you killed Mike.

01:40:43.902 --> 01:40:45.486
Shut the fuck up!

01:40:45.695 --> 01:40:47.446
Shut the...

01:40:47.656 --> 01:40:50.282
Come on,
let's get the fuck out of here.

01:40:50.826 --> 01:40:52.409
Come on.

01:40:57.415 --> 01:40:59.625
Fuck. Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:40:59.793 --> 01:41:01.126
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:41:01.294 --> 01:41:03.128
- Come on.
- Look at that.

01:41:03.338 --> 01:41:04.839
Come on. Get...

01:41:05.006 --> 01:41:07.383
Come on. Let's get the fuck out.

01:41:07.592 --> 01:41:09.093
Come on.

01:41:50.093 --> 01:41:52.011
Where were you last night?

01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:54.430
I thought we were
supposed to get together.

01:42:00.687 --> 01:42:02.855
You're on something again, huh?

01:42:04.441 --> 01:42:06.191
James...

01:42:09.112 --> 01:42:11.822
So when will I get to see you?

01:42:19.581 --> 01:42:21.415
I got to go.

01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:08.016
Who are you?

01:46:08.226 --> 01:46:12.312
Who are you? Who are you?

01:46:15.066 --> 01:46:17.609
Who are you?

01:46:52.937 --> 01:46:54.146
Laura, honey?

01:46:59.736 --> 01:47:01.820
I really would like to talk to you.

01:47:04.949 --> 01:47:06.992
Laura, sweetheart.

01:47:13.666 --> 01:47:15.792
- Laura...
- No, no, no.

01:47:38.483 --> 01:47:39.524
Laura, honey?

01:47:41.236 --> 01:47:42.986
Sweetheart?

01:47:44.822 --> 01:47:47.741
Laura, is something wrong
this morning?

01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:54.248
Stay away from me.

01:49:21.044 --> 01:49:23.837
No, not tonight.

01:49:26.507 --> 01:49:28.383
Just...

01:49:28.551 --> 01:49:32.596
...give me some stuff
to hold me over until tomorrow.

01:49:32.764 --> 01:49:34.598
Why?

01:49:34.807 --> 01:49:37.684
Why not? Where you going?

01:49:41.856 --> 01:49:44.107
Where are you going?

01:49:46.778 --> 01:49:50.197
I'm going home, Bobby.

01:49:55.495 --> 01:49:57.329
You don't want me.

01:49:59.707 --> 01:50:01.666
You just want the blow, don't you?

01:50:04.212 --> 01:50:08.507
It's okay.

01:50:09.133 --> 01:50:11.301
Bobby's got it.

01:50:21.270 --> 01:50:23.230
Good night.

01:50:24.232 --> 01:50:26.108
Good night, sweetheart.

01:50:58.266 --> 01:50:59.933
Hello.

01:51:01.269 --> 01:51:03.353
James.

01:51:05.273 --> 01:51:07.190
Yeah, okay.

01:51:13.197 --> 01:51:15.198
Oh, James,

01:51:15.867 --> 01:51:18.410
I do love you, but...

01:51:24.292 --> 01:51:26.543
Okay.

01:51:27.420 --> 01:51:32.007
I'll meet you in 15...

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.344
I'll meet you in 15 minutes.

01:51:37.722 --> 01:51:39.639
Okay?

01:51:40.308 --> 01:51:43.226
I'll meet you in 15 minutes.

01:51:52.487 --> 01:51:55.489
God, why did I say that?

01:51:56.199 --> 01:51:59.201
Fifteen minutes?

01:53:41.012 --> 01:53:42.512
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:53:43.306 --> 01:53:45.473
That's right.

01:53:45.683 --> 01:53:49.227
There's no place left to go,
is there, James?

01:53:51.731 --> 01:53:54.190
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:57.235
You know it and I know it.

01:53:58.446 --> 01:54:00.572
What's wrong with us?

01:54:02.158 --> 01:54:04.409
I mean, we have everything.

01:54:05.620 --> 01:54:08.371
Everything but everything.

01:54:12.001 --> 01:54:13.168
Laura.

01:54:15.254 --> 01:54:17.881
"Laura."

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.641
You always hurt the ones you love.

01:54:27.850 --> 01:54:30.101
You mean the ones you pity.

01:54:30.853 --> 01:54:33.146
Say whatever you want.

01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:38.234
I know you love me.

01:54:40.404 --> 01:54:42.447
And I love you.

01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:59.130
I do love you, James.

01:55:00.925 --> 01:55:03.635
Let's get lost together.

01:55:17.692 --> 01:55:18.733
Shit.

01:55:20.444 --> 01:55:21.986
What?

01:55:23.739 --> 01:55:26.449
He might try to kill you.

01:55:28.077 --> 01:55:29.244
Laura.

01:55:32.832 --> 01:55:34.791
What's wrong?

01:55:36.377 --> 01:55:37.669
What?

01:55:38.546 --> 01:55:40.797
If he finds out.

01:55:43.008 --> 01:55:44.843
Laura, what's the matter?

01:55:50.891 --> 01:55:52.851
Bobby killed a guy.

01:55:54.687 --> 01:55:56.396
What are you talking about?

01:55:56.605 --> 01:55:58.440
Bobby didn't kill anybody.

01:56:00.609 --> 01:56:02.318
Do you want to see?

01:56:03.487 --> 01:56:05.280
See what?

01:56:07.783 --> 01:56:09.409
Right.

01:56:12.538 --> 01:56:15.331
Open your eyes, James.

01:56:22.506 --> 01:56:24.966
You don't even know me.

01:56:26.010 --> 01:56:28.803
There are things about me...

01:56:30.639 --> 01:56:33.725
Even Donna doesn't know me.

01:56:51.076 --> 01:56:54.204
Your Laura disappeared.

01:57:10.137 --> 01:57:12.472
It's just me now.

01:57:20.314 --> 01:57:21.523
Laura.

01:57:28.239 --> 01:57:30.573
What about this, James?

01:57:49.593 --> 01:57:52.428
I think you want
to take me home now.

01:58:05.818 --> 01:58:08.444
- Laura!
- Don't!

01:58:08.654 --> 01:58:09.696
Come on.

01:58:11.115 --> 01:58:15.201
Just don't!

01:58:18.998 --> 01:58:22.333
I love you, James!

01:58:58.037 --> 01:59:00.622
You're right on time, baby.

02:00:15.322 --> 02:00:16.990
Don't.

02:00:18.283 --> 02:00:19.492
Jacques.

02:00:19.702 --> 02:00:21.369
Don't.

02:00:22.746 --> 02:00:25.665
Don't tie me up tonight, goddamn it!

02:00:25.874 --> 02:00:27.458
- Stop it.
- Don't!

02:00:29.253 --> 02:00:31.212
Laura!

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:33.798
- Don't tie me up!
- Laura!

02:00:34.883 --> 02:00:36.551
Don't!

02:01:09.877 --> 02:01:12.628
Leo, will you untie me?

02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:32.315
Leo, will you please untie me?

02:01:32.524 --> 02:01:34.442
Shut up!

02:01:51.919 --> 02:01:53.920
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

02:02:19.196 --> 02:02:20.530
Daddy!

02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:24.575
Bob?

02:02:58.026 --> 02:02:59.527
Are you gonna kill me?

02:03:03.448 --> 02:03:05.158
Father...

02:03:07.452 --> 02:03:09.287
...if I die now,

02:03:09.496 --> 02:03:14.584
will you please see me?

02:03:20.549 --> 02:03:22.800
Your diary.

02:03:24.386 --> 02:03:27.305
I always thought
you knew it was me.

02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:30.766
Don't look at me.

02:03:33.937 --> 02:03:38.524
I never knew you knew it was me.

02:03:38.734 --> 02:03:40.610
I want you.

02:03:40.819 --> 02:03:42.945
I'm so dirty.

02:03:44.489 --> 02:03:46.324
I'm not ready.

02:03:49.077 --> 02:03:55.416
I'm sorry.

02:04:27.074 --> 02:04:30.451
Let me in! Let me in!

02:04:57.396 --> 02:05:02.066
No!

02:05:02.276 --> 02:05:04.443
Don't make me do this!

02:05:04.653 --> 02:05:07.321
No!

02:08:48.793 --> 02:08:50.794
Judy?
