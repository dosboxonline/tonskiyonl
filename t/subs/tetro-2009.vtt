WEBVTT

03:27.807 --> 03:29.035
Benjamin.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.949
Benjamin. Angelo's brother.
I sent a telegram.

03:41.921 --> 03:45.357
I am Miranda, your sister in law.
Well, sort of.

03:52.332 --> 03:54.857
I never had a sister in law before.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.196
Lucky me!

03:58.004 --> 04:00.097
What should I call you? Benjamin?

04:00.206 --> 04:01.730
Bennie's good.

04:03.610 --> 04:05.407
Are you in the Navy, Bennie?

04:06.346 --> 04:10.783
No, I work on a cruise ship, <i>Infinity Lines,</i>

04:10.883 --> 04:13.078
I'm a waiter, sort of.

04:14.854 --> 04:17.516
You are so much younger than I thought.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.488
I'm going to be 18 on Sunday.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.891
In three days! I'll throw a party.

04:26.299 --> 04:27.425
Great.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.637
Let me see if he's awake.

04:31.738 --> 04:36.334
Because he has a hard time
falling asleep, you know.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.116
Tetro.

04:50.890 --> 04:53.381
Are you awake? Your brother's here.

05:05.505 --> 05:09.305
I was just a little kid
when he went on his writing sabbatical.

05:11.744 --> 05:12.904
That...

05:13.313 --> 05:15.577
That's the last time I saw him.

05:17.350 --> 05:21.753
I'm so happy to see you, Bennie,
and meet you and all, but...

05:26.926 --> 05:30.089
He really doesn't want
to know his family anymore.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.998
I guess he's up now.

05:39.839 --> 05:40.806
No.

05:41.641 --> 05:43.438
He wants me to go in.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.411
But you can stay here tonight.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.192
Thank you.

06:06.199 --> 06:08.133
You know, he's really...

06:11.738 --> 06:14.673
I don't want you to have your feelings hurt.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.809
Jesus.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.319
What the fuck happened to you?

09:56.662 --> 09:58.425
I walked into a bus.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.999
Did she get you coffee?

10:05.271 --> 10:06.863
No, I just woke up.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.803
She's been really nice.

10:11.043 --> 10:15.377
I hate nice, especially the word.
I hate the word "nice."

10:17.149 --> 10:18.343
Oh, man.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.588
Are you okay?

10:24.023 --> 10:25.854
What happened, Bennie?

10:27.393 --> 10:29.884
You get in a fight with the Great One?

10:30.863 --> 10:33.195
I ran away from military school.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.366
Escaped from prison, more like it.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.330
Tell me about it.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.477
Dad doesn't know where I am.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.845
I got this job because
I knew how to wear a uniform.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.745
Lied about my age.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.455
You just took off?
Yeah.

11:00.393 --> 11:01.860
Just like you.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.665
Come on, baby.
Morning.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.600
Look how beautiful my baby is.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.205
Look at that face.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.612
Doesn't she look like Ava Gardner
with her hair like that?

11:25.718 --> 11:27.345
Who's Ava Gardner?

11:32.892 --> 11:35.656
I was surprised to hear from you, Bennie.

11:36.562 --> 11:39.827
Well, I...
My boat had an engine malfunction.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.235
It's gonna take about
four or five days to fix it.

11:46.872 --> 11:49.033
So, you're working on a ship?

11:49.475 --> 11:53.502
Well, I'm just...
I'm a waiter, but I caught the travel bug.

11:54.580 --> 11:55.842
From you.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.710
From me?

11:58.517 --> 12:01.782
Well, then let's hope
that's all you caught, Bennie.

12:02.488 --> 12:04.752
You remember when you moved in the attic

12:04.857 --> 12:08.122
and you had all those, like, maps?

12:08.227 --> 12:12.664
Remember that, with the Tahiti,
and the Pacific, Pitcairn Island?

12:13.466 --> 12:17.300
So, they're fixing the engine
on the boat, right?

12:19.004 --> 12:22.235
Yeah.
So, you can still sleep on the boat?

12:22.341 --> 12:24.275
He can stay with us.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.434
Why not, Tetro?

12:26.846 --> 12:28.575
It's only one week.

12:29.181 --> 12:31.581
Let's go out and show him La Boca.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.612
Okay. Let's go for a walk.

12:37.223 --> 12:39.691
Go ahead, put your pants on.
Okay.

12:45.364 --> 12:48.663
Little Bennie, the able bodied seaman.

12:50.936 --> 12:54.394
I'm not even a waiter, not even.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.802
I'll jump in the shower
and be ready in 10 minutes.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.206
Miranda.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.170
Just me and him, okay?

13:36.615 --> 13:39.846
Listen, you stay one week, okay?

13:40.252 --> 13:43.517
That boat sails, you're on it.
Sure. Thanks, Angie.

13:45.057 --> 13:47.685
Angie's dead. My name is Tetro.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.250
Sit here.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.916
How come you say I'm your friend
and not your brother?

14:47.253 --> 14:49.016
Do you speak Spanish?

14:49.355 --> 14:51.380
Enough to understand that.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.925
People around here
don't know much about me.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.753
Miranda doesn't even know
who our father is.

15:00.599 --> 15:02.794
I'd like to keep it that way.

15:04.436 --> 15:06.131
I don't care. Yeah.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.041
What?

15:10.142 --> 15:14.476
It's just, it's gonna be kind of hard to have
a conversation if I can't ask any questions.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.571
And who wants a conversation?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.743
Not me.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.876
So, why did you come here, Bennie?

15:53.252 --> 15:55.117
I don't like questions.

15:55.554 --> 15:56.521
Hey.

15:57.923 --> 16:02.053
Don't do me, do you. I'll do me. Okay?

16:02.161 --> 16:04.129
It's just, it's not fair.

16:05.331 --> 16:10.394
You left, you never came back and got me,
and I didn't even get, like, an explanation.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.468
And you're my brother?

16:28.554 --> 16:30.579
The ship sails on Tuesday at 2:00 p.m.
Okay.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.281
Don't forget to call in.

16:39.365 --> 16:41.230
Hi, Bennie.
Hi, Anita.

16:42.935 --> 16:45.733
So, he survived four bad accidents.

16:45.838 --> 16:51.276
And one more, with his mother, before that.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.944
Well, you know we have different mothers?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.176
His died in a car accident.

17:02.287 --> 17:05.381
Yes, but...

17:06.157 --> 17:08.148
Tell me about your mother.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.788
About mine?
Yes.

17:12.131 --> 17:14.998
She's been in a coma for nine years.

17:21.173 --> 17:24.142
We're going to have
some good times this week.

17:26.211 --> 17:32.150
A family needs as much fun as it can get,
don't you think?

17:53.372 --> 17:55.704
Ana, no! No!

18:04.883 --> 18:07.408
Actually, they're very much in love.

18:07.953 --> 18:09.318
That's love?

18:10.689 --> 18:12.987
Did you ever sleep with a girl?

18:14.126 --> 18:15.218
What?

18:15.828 --> 18:16.817
No.

19:10.382 --> 19:14.443
That's Abelardo Vaca Castex, some phony.

19:46.618 --> 19:47.778
<i>"Fausta,</i>

19:50.055 --> 19:51.750
"A drama in verse."

19:54.693 --> 19:56.422
What could be worse?

20:10.709 --> 20:12.438
Do you like dancing?

20:53.518 --> 20:57.978
Well, Bennie, what would you like
for your birthday? Tell me.

20:59.191 --> 21:03.594
Just this, to be here
with you and Tetro, here, and...

21:05.530 --> 21:07.760
You know, Tetro's...

21:07.866 --> 21:11.029
I don't remember. How do you say this?

21:12.170 --> 21:13.228
Cast.

21:13.538 --> 21:15.904
Tetro's cast is coming off today.

21:16.575 --> 21:19.066
I bet he'll be back to his old self.

21:20.512 --> 21:21.945
I can't wait.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.475
What's that like?

21:25.484 --> 21:27.145
You can't imagine.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.077
Full of interesting things, you know,
brilliant things.

21:32.658 --> 21:36.719
Also, he has a warm heart, you know?

21:38.063 --> 21:43.365
Well, more of a warm heart
than he's had lately, of course.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.328
Are you married?

21:48.106 --> 21:49.573
As if I were.

21:58.050 --> 22:02.987
The doctor said that I could walk
without my cane if I'm very careful. So...

22:06.491 --> 22:08.925
Easy.
No problem.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.491
My leg!
Are you okay?

22:16.468 --> 22:17.958
Miranda's kiss.

22:19.037 --> 22:21.938
Miranda's kiss! The miracle cure!

22:22.240 --> 22:24.105
She fixed me right up.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.402
One kiss, and it's perfect!

22:29.915 --> 22:31.348
You fixed me.

22:35.087 --> 22:38.955
What were you doing?
You dancing for Bennie?

22:40.292 --> 22:42.123
Just doing my workout.

22:44.596 --> 22:46.223
Dressed like that?

22:47.466 --> 22:49.593
As always.
Your workout?

22:49.701 --> 22:50.895
Asshole!

22:51.937 --> 22:52.926
Okay.

23:17.028 --> 23:20.759
So, you call him your brother
and me your friend?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.299
What is that?

23:23.335 --> 23:25.701
Would you like to go back
to the boat, Bennie?

23:25.804 --> 23:27.669
Sleep on your hammock?

23:28.540 --> 23:31.566
You couldn't just say it? "Brother"?

23:33.412 --> 23:35.573
Brother. Okay?

23:37.916 --> 23:38.883
Yeah, thanks.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.094
Happy I have my cast off.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.132
Maybe you'll start your work again?

23:57.502 --> 23:58.730
My work?

24:00.572 --> 24:02.005
Your writing?

24:02.541 --> 24:04.270
I don't have a pencil.
Well, you went on this...

24:04.376 --> 24:06.207
I don't have a pencil.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.743
I'm a writer, too.

24:13.418 --> 24:15.352
What do you write about?

24:16.888 --> 24:18.856
I walked away from that.

24:20.792 --> 24:24.455
How do you walk away from your work?
Doesn't it follow you?

24:27.532 --> 24:29.397
So, what was it about?

24:45.817 --> 24:47.648
It was about brothers.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.686
Yeah, and...

24:52.390 --> 24:56.952
One brother, a prodigy in music,

24:57.062 --> 24:59.963
and the older brother,
also a great musician.

25:01.299 --> 25:02.926
The theme is ancient.

25:05.871 --> 25:07.065
Rivalry.

25:08.139 --> 25:10.835
You're writing the story of our father?

25:15.881 --> 25:19.282
One brother goes to New York City,
becomes a big star,

25:19.384 --> 25:24.083
he does nothing to help the older brother,
who taught him everything he knew.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.057
Uncle Alfie? The Tootsie Rolls?

25:28.326 --> 25:29.691
Uncle Alfie.

25:33.231 --> 25:34.858
Yeah, Uncle Alfie.

25:37.936 --> 25:40.029
You know what?
I'm breaking my own rules here.

25:40.138 --> 25:41.469
What rules?

25:42.407 --> 25:43.806
What about your mother?

25:43.909 --> 25:46.605
She was, like, this famous singer,
I know, and she died,

25:46.711 --> 25:49.612
but no one's ever told me
anything about her.

25:50.782 --> 25:54.309
Bennie, I thought we had an agreement.
What agreement?

25:56.087 --> 25:57.748
What about my mom?

26:08.667 --> 26:14.071
Listen, I divorced myself
from my family, okay?

26:15.006 --> 26:19.943
Father, sisters, all of it. All of it. All right?

26:20.612 --> 26:23.740
I don't want to talk about it. That's it.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.579
Don't you love them?

26:29.287 --> 26:30.914
Yeah, I love them.

26:32.624 --> 26:35.058
You know what love is
in a family like ours, Bennie?

26:35.160 --> 26:37.424
It's a quick stab in the heart.

26:39.664 --> 26:42.258
I knew your mother died in a car accident,

26:42.367 --> 26:45.427
I just never knew
that you were driving the car.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.274
Well, now you know.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.885
She didn't tell me, Tetro.
Wait, she didn't tell me.

27:01.987 --> 27:05.514
Thanks a lot, Miranda.
She didn't tell me, Tetro!

27:06.925 --> 27:08.392
She didn't...

27:12.263 --> 27:16.597
Tetro, Miranda didn't tell me anything!
I figured it out by myself.

27:28.380 --> 27:30.473
I only have a few days more.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.381
Maybe I should just move back on the boat.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.213
What is with him?

27:45.130 --> 27:50.625
He's like a genius, but without
enough accomplishments, you know?

27:52.170 --> 27:55.571
That's why his behavior is like this.

27:56.007 --> 28:00.068
One day, it's...
Another day, he's completely an asshole.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.213
You sound like a doctor.

28:03.715 --> 28:05.205
I am a doctor.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.343
When I met him,
I was his doctor at the asylum.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.153
Asylum? What kind of asylum?

28:14.459 --> 28:16.450
It was called La Colifata.

28:25.036 --> 28:28.301
<i>With the radio for an hour a week,</i>
<i>on Saturdays,</i>

28:41.753 --> 28:47.692
<i>I came from Europe to Argentina</i>
<i>to study with the founder of La Colifata,</i>

28:48.927 --> 28:53.091
<i>who realized that</i>
<i>whoever had the microphone</i>

28:53.198 --> 28:55.894
<i>flnally had found someone to listen,</i>

30:03.568 --> 30:05.502
<i>He said he was a writer,</i>

30:07.005 --> 30:11.237
<i>and he held everything he had written</i>
<i>against his breast,</i>

30:12.877 --> 30:15.277
<i>It was the only copy that existed,</i>

30:18.583 --> 30:20.517
That is where I met him.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.187
Then finally, he said...

31:43.234 --> 31:44.633
My father is

31:52.477 --> 31:54.342
a real son of a bitch.

31:55.747 --> 31:59.274
My father could be really mean
and really violent.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.784
And he could hit hard.

32:15.533 --> 32:19.128
Then I did... I did the unforgivable.

32:21.372 --> 32:24.102
Crazier than my craziest patient.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.381
<i>I fell in love with him,</i>

36:09.367 --> 36:11.335
<i>He was the older brother,</i>

36:12.270 --> 36:16.104
<i>But Alfredo, dear, sweet Uncle Alfle</i>

36:17.175 --> 36:19.666
<i>was summoned downtown</i>
<i>by the Great One,</i>

36:19.777 --> 36:23.144
<i>like a schoolboy</i>
<i>who had done something wrong,</i>

36:23.247 --> 36:25.272
It's not a big production.

36:25.616 --> 36:27.641
<i>Rigoletto,</i> down and dirty.

36:28.553 --> 36:30.851
Small orchestra, rented scenery.

36:31.556 --> 36:33.285
But if it goes bad,

36:33.658 --> 36:37.321
the newspapers will call it
"the shit Tetrocini <i>Rigoletto,''</i>

36:39.063 --> 36:41.588
It won't be a shit <i>Rigoletto,</i>

36:42.099 --> 36:47.059
Alfie, why don't you just conduct
under another name?

36:48.706 --> 36:50.936
You want me to change my name?

36:52.376 --> 36:53.673
Thank you.

36:56.347 --> 36:57.405
Yes.

37:00.418 --> 37:03.148
I had the Tetrocini name before you did.

37:21.405 --> 37:22.531
Carlo?

37:34.518 --> 37:35.576
Shit!

37:57.174 --> 37:59.972
What are you doing, Bennie, sitting there?

38:01.012 --> 38:02.877
Yeah, I'm just sitting.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.248
Just sitting?

38:05.916 --> 38:07.349
Just sitting.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.317
That's her name, Problema.

38:43.421 --> 38:44.649
Oh, really?
Yeah.

38:58.936 --> 39:00.733
Hello. Hello.

39:02.073 --> 39:03.631
Happy birthday, Bennie.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.073
I bet you always wanted a puppy.

39:11.716 --> 39:16.619
The Tetrocini family came to this country
in the year 1901.

39:17.588 --> 39:21.388
The first Benjamin made it big
in the wholesale chicken business.

39:21.492 --> 39:24.757
But he liked to sing,
and he played mandolin.

39:35.806 --> 39:38.673
Mr. Shakespeare, what is free verse?

39:40.878 --> 39:43.073
Something that doesn't rhyme.

39:44.281 --> 39:48.479
What else?
Has no fixed number of syllables.

39:51.522 --> 39:55.549
You know, everything that I love or that
I'm interested in, I picked up from you.

39:55.659 --> 39:59.686
You were the one who took me everywhere
and showed me books

39:59.797 --> 40:03.733
and those strange movies, <i>The Red Shoes,</i>

40:05.436 --> 40:07.631
You thought <i>Red Shoeswas</i> strange?
Yeah.

40:07.738 --> 40:10.832
What about <i>Tales of Hoffman?</i>
<i>Coppélia,</i> the dancing doll?

40:10.941 --> 40:12.806
Yeah, <i>Tales of Hoffman,</i> That...

40:12.910 --> 40:15.708
<i>Tales of Hoffman</i> always reminds me of you.

41:28.085 --> 41:30.485
Love. What is love?

41:31.489 --> 41:33.389
Love is nothing.

42:07.591 --> 42:08.580
She is my niece.

42:08.692 --> 42:09.659
Hi.
Hi.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.387
Maria Luisa...
Maria Luisa.

42:11.495 --> 42:13.053
...is 18 years old, like you.

42:16.033 --> 42:17.762
Bennie...
Does she take after you?

42:20.838 --> 42:22.829
Maria Luisa, Maria Luisa!

42:23.574 --> 42:24.734
Oh, no, no, no.

42:24.842 --> 42:27.276
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

42:27.578 --> 42:28.840
Oh, yeah.

43:02.546 --> 43:04.070
Happy birthday.

43:12.323 --> 43:13.290
Joy! Joy!

43:14.158 --> 43:16.422
Waitress, waitress. More champagne.

43:25.936 --> 43:27.096
Happy birthday, Bennie.

43:28.138 --> 43:29.105
All right.

43:44.888 --> 43:47.448
I wrote a song with that name once.
Really?

43:47.558 --> 43:50.220
You know why he's in such a jolly mood?

43:50.394 --> 43:51.452
I don't really know.

43:54.164 --> 43:55.153
It's <i>La Cucaracha,</i>

43:55.265 --> 43:58.666
Because my boat's leaving, with me on it.

43:58.936 --> 44:03.270
No! No, no, no, he's excited
because tomorrow he runs the lights.

44:04.575 --> 44:08.102
He loves to do that.
He becomes the Phantom of the Opera!

46:45.969 --> 46:47.095
Oh, God!

47:14.865 --> 47:15.923
All right, all right, all right.

48:32.376 --> 48:33.707
Come on, come on!

48:53.964 --> 48:55.124
Abelardo.

49:17.821 --> 49:18.788
Who is that?

49:54.491 --> 49:56.686
But let the play continue.

50:27.457 --> 50:28.424
Who is that?

50:28.525 --> 50:32.120
That is the most important critic and writer
in South America.

50:32.329 --> 50:37.562
She uses the pen name "Alone."
Runs the Patagonia Festival, you know.

50:44.074 --> 50:49.444
She was your brother's
teacher and mentor, until...

50:50.781 --> 50:52.112
Until what?

50:52.516 --> 50:57.146
Until she turned against him, you know.
There are many different stories why.

50:58.321 --> 51:00.221
No one knows the truth.

51:01.391 --> 51:02.881
It's a mystery.

51:06.863 --> 51:11.129
Like the mystery of your father,
and who he really is.

51:25.849 --> 51:28.943
"Carlo Tetrocini comes
from Genovese ancestors

51:29.052 --> 51:32.988
"who emigrated to Argentina in 1901.

51:35.358 --> 51:39.055
"He was discovered
by Austrian conductor Erich Kleiber,

51:39.162 --> 51:41.130
"who took him to Berlin.

51:42.065 --> 51:46.434
"He is one of the world's
great symphony conductors."

51:52.876 --> 51:55.310
Carlo Tetrocini is Tetro's father?

51:57.914 --> 51:59.677
That's our last name.

52:06.690 --> 52:11.184
"Tetrocini has conducted the Metropolitan
Philharmonic Orchestra of New York

52:11.294 --> 52:12.921
"for 35 years."

52:14.931 --> 52:17.092
How did that get in our home?

52:18.001 --> 52:20.128
How did this get in my home?

52:33.683 --> 52:34.672
Remember?

52:37.854 --> 52:42.018
But you said money was always a problem,
even made you do robberies!

52:42.125 --> 52:43.888
Money was a problem.

52:44.361 --> 52:46.989
He had money. I didn't. Okay?

52:47.097 --> 52:48.564
Let's read on.

52:48.899 --> 52:52.767
"His wife,
the acclaimed soprano Angela Panzara,

52:52.869 --> 52:55.997
"was tragically killed
in an automobile accident.

52:57.007 --> 53:00.408
"He remarried several times."
Enough. That's enough. That's enough.

53:00.510 --> 53:02.876
Just stop. Please, stop.

53:07.984 --> 53:10.418
I'll be at the other insane asylum.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.154
I need a break to clear my head.

53:21.698 --> 53:24.929
How could you do this to me?
How could you do that?

53:26.069 --> 53:28.060
How could you do it to me?

53:28.605 --> 53:30.300
You broke our oath.

53:32.342 --> 53:35.402
I never made any oath. I never agreed.

53:35.512 --> 53:37.707
You make rules,
that doesn't mean I have to follow them.

53:37.814 --> 53:40.305
I make rules for my house, Bennie.

53:40.417 --> 53:42.317
This is my house.
These rules are only for my house.

53:42.419 --> 53:44.614
It's not about your little house,
it's not about your little kingdom.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.019
It's my house and my business.

53:48.858 --> 53:50.951
Our family is our business.

53:52.662 --> 53:54.493
Why don't you call your boat, Bennie?

53:54.598 --> 53:56.998
Why don't you call them up?
'Cause I think they all miss you over there.

53:57.100 --> 53:58.658
Every boat needs a little rat on it.

53:58.768 --> 54:02.534
So, why don't you call them up
and see if they want you back?

54:06.576 --> 54:09.739
Hi, I'm calling because
my brother's an asshole.

54:09.846 --> 54:12.610
I'm the asshole now? I'm the asshole?

54:13.450 --> 54:15.509
Good move. Good turnaround.

54:18.321 --> 54:19.754
I'm going back to my boat.

54:19.856 --> 54:23.019
Go back to your ship. Good idea.
You're real good.

54:23.827 --> 54:26.261
But I just want you to hear something first.

54:26.363 --> 54:27.455
You want me to hear your confession

54:27.564 --> 54:29.725
of all the little, sneaky things
you've done behind my back?

54:29.833 --> 54:33.792
"Dear Bennie,
I'm so sorry to be writing you this

54:33.903 --> 54:36.565
"and not be able to tell you in person..."

54:36.873 --> 54:38.966
Hey, I don't want to hear that.

54:39.075 --> 54:41.236
"I'm going away for a little while,

54:41.344 --> 54:45.303
"but I promise you that I will come back..."
Hey, read it to yourself. Read it to yourself.

54:45.415 --> 54:49.010
Why? 'Cause you remember writing it?
Do you remember this?

54:49.119 --> 54:50.108
Okay, you're running away now.

54:50.220 --> 54:52.620
You're running away
from your own writing.

54:52.722 --> 54:55.657
"I promise you
that I will come back and get you.

54:55.759 --> 54:59.058
"I know things are very hard sometimes
in our family.

54:59.162 --> 55:01.494
"I need to go away for a little while
on a writing sabbatical."

55:01.598 --> 55:03.190
I don't want to hear it. Get out of my room.

55:03.300 --> 55:08.260
"I have things that I want for my life,
and someday you will understand.

55:08.371 --> 55:12.364
"You're very young now,
but someday you will understand."

55:12.475 --> 55:15.171
Get out of my way.
"I promise that I'll come back and get you.

55:15.278 --> 55:21.581
"Love... Love... Love, your brother, Angelo.

55:22.619 --> 55:25.486
"Love, your brother, Angelo."

56:12.602 --> 56:15.503
<i>''X"does whatever he can</i>

56:16.206 --> 56:20.074

<i>Dad, I don't want to continue with pre med,</i>

If not pre med, then what?

56:32.355 --> 56:33.686
Philosophy.

56:34.257 --> 56:36.919
How do you make a living at philosophy?

56:38.628 --> 56:41.597
I want to be a novelist.

56:43.500 --> 56:46.560
Novelist? A writer?

56:47.637 --> 56:50.037
Yes. That's what I want to do.

56:51.574 --> 56:56.739
Well, to make a living as a writer,
you'd have to be a genius.

57:01.284 --> 57:02.308
So?

57:03.653 --> 57:06.747
There's only room for one genius

57:30.046 --> 57:31.479

57:31.581 --> 57:33.640

57:44.961 --> 57:48.761
Yeah, well, don't love me, okay?
Be my sister, but don't love me.

57:48.865 --> 57:51.095
Don't say that. I don't want to hear that.

57:57.006 --> 58:00.066
Do your writing and just...
With our blessing.

58:00.176 --> 58:01.507
I don't want to talk to my father.

58:01.611 --> 58:05.411
I don't want to talk to anybody
from the family ever again.

58:05.682 --> 58:08.116
Pop will send you the money,
all the money you need.

58:08.218 --> 58:10.880
<i>I'm getting off the phone now, Goodbye,</i>

58:26.536 --> 58:27.730
Again! Sorry, sorry!

58:29.072 --> 58:31.438
Let's start again. Letter "Q."

58:52.228 --> 58:54.662
Good! Monday, 11:00.

59:11.047 --> 59:15.279
So, you're going on a sabbatical?

59:18.421 --> 59:19.649
To write?

59:21.057 --> 59:24.151
One of these checks will arrive
wherever you go,

59:24.994 --> 59:26.689
every three months.

59:31.067 --> 59:35.265
I expect you to cut out this nonsense
about Bennie once and for all.

59:37.407 --> 59:39.034
For your own sake.

59:41.444 --> 59:43.571
Someday, you will understand.

59:44.914 --> 59:50.045
Go. Go on this sabbatical to write

59:54.290 --> 59:56.224
or to find yourself.

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:05.463
And when you go on
this writing sabbatical, Angelo,

01:00:07.537 --> 01:00:09.562
what will you write about?

01:00:12.408 --> 01:00:15.002
I said, what will you write about?

01:00:16.512 --> 01:00:18.844
Carlo! Carlo! Over here! Over here!

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.644
Maestro Tetrocini!
Carlo, right here! Right here!

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:23.981
Look here. Look here, Maestro Tetrocini.

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:25.746
This.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.400
Bennie? Bennie?
What? What?

01:00:42.438 --> 01:00:44.235
Bennie, what is this?

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.501
Bennie, how could you do this?
What if he walks in?

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:50.078
I fell asleep.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.351
You can't be careless
and have him find you like this.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:02.322
You haven't seen him really blow.

01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:08.931
It's all backwards and in code.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:18.437
Maybe you should tell him you have these,
ask his permission.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.400
Here.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:23.408
How did you find these? How?

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.680
It was an accident.
An accident?

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:27.511
Yeah.
An accident.

01:01:55.178 --> 01:01:59.740
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie. You are leaving.

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:06.421
You know, maybe Josefina's niece
is gonna miss you, don't you think?

01:02:08.491 --> 01:02:13.019
Can I use the phone, really quick?
I just have to check in with my cruise ship.

01:02:13.129 --> 01:02:14.426
Of course.

01:02:17.366 --> 01:02:19.334
Did you like Maria Luisa?

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.969
<i>Inflnity Lines, por favor,</i>

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:28.408
Yes, I liked Maria Luisa,
but I think that Tetro frightened her off.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:32.815
Hi, this is Benjamin Tetrocini. I just...

01:02:34.617 --> 01:02:35.675
Okay.

01:02:39.956 --> 01:02:41.423
There you are.

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:44.485
Hey, how you doing?

01:02:47.463 --> 01:02:48.430
Hey, my wife.

01:02:52.301 --> 01:02:55.065
Okay. I'll be there. Great.

01:02:56.372 --> 01:02:57.669
Thank you.

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:04.179
Now he speaks Spanish.
He'll be here forever.

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.247
My engines are fixed.
Oh, really?

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.446
Yeah, I'm on my way.

01:03:13.723 --> 01:03:16.089
The <i>Wanderlust,</i> You'll enjoy.

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.284
<i>Wander Lust,</i>

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:23.321
That's a good title.
Title for what?

01:03:24.433 --> 01:03:28.460
She... She wants to go out. We trained her!

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:32.372
Amazing. Amazing.
I'll take her.

01:03:42.785 --> 01:03:44.582
He loves you so much.

01:03:46.656 --> 01:03:48.749
I wonder how that happened.

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:03.354
Bennie...

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.037
Flowers?

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.208
You in pain?

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:04.453
How's the puppy?
She's back with José.

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:07.446
I hope he doesn't eat her.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.994
I guess my ship sailed without me.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:16.825
Good looking cast.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:19.962
Flowers?

01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:25.474
Yeah.

01:07:28.844 --> 01:07:30.937
This used to be my old room.

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:34.513
I miss it.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.679
So, you came to see the room?

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.979
I miss the room.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.814
Here, put these.

01:07:43.125 --> 01:07:47.619
After I get out, I'm going to stay
with Abelardo or Josefina or something.

01:07:48.130 --> 01:07:49.597
With Abelardo?

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:56.200
You can stay with us.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:00.907
That's okay?

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:04.979
I'll make do.

01:09:19.787 --> 01:09:21.813
<i>Is Angelo Tetrocini there?</i>

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.852
<i>Do you speak English?</i>
<i>I'm calling from New y ork,</i>

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:28.794
One moment.

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.523
Who is it?
It's America.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:34.957
Who?

01:09:35.069 --> 01:09:39.939
<i>This is the offlce of Carlo Tetrocini,</i>
<i>We need to speak to Angelo,</i>

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:47.509
Himself?

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.448
His office.

01:09:59.461 --> 01:10:00.428
Hello?

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:07.058
I got CDs and some books.

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:11.129
Léon Felipe. I mean...

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:17.237
Roberto Bolaño, and Alone's new book.

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.840
Oh, wow.

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.707
<i>New Horizons in Literature,</i>

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.443
Gee. Thank you.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:31.518
Are you mentioned in here?
No.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:36.626
Bennie, your father's office
called last night.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.167
He's had a stroke. He's still alive.

01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:46.569
But they wanted you both to know that
there were tickets for you to come back.

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:50.576
Is he going?

01:10:51.113 --> 01:10:52.842
No, he's not going.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.676
I have nothing to say to him.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:01.888
I brought you some comics,
some gossip magazines

01:11:01.991 --> 01:11:04.016
to help you learn Spanish.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:11.566
See you later.

01:11:12.735 --> 01:11:13.759
Bye.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:12:00.613
<i>''X"called"N''</i>

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.514
<i>and said he'd introduce her to his father,</i>

01:12:04.086 --> 01:12:06.611
<i>"N"is very impressed,</i>

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:10.086
<i>Happily, of course,</i>

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:17.332
Angie.

01:12:19.134 --> 01:12:22.126
This is my father, Carlo Tetrocini.

01:12:23.639 --> 01:12:25.937
And this is Naomi White.

01:12:28.911 --> 01:12:30.071
Naomi?

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:34.275
I've told you about her.
It's an honor to meet you, Maestro.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:38.149
You know, years ago I wrote a song
called <i>Naomi,</i>

01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:50.155
My father always listens
to your records, Mr. Tetrocini.

01:12:50.432 --> 01:12:52.491
He tells me you're even greater
than Fritz Reiner.

01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:56.196
Well, Fritz was good,
but you can call me Carlo.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.806
Do you stay for dinner?

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.375
Oh, Dad, we can't. We're meeting friends.

01:13:01.477 --> 01:13:06.437
I invite all of your friends all over.
I'll throw a lobster party.

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:08.275
Great! Can we?

01:13:22.464 --> 01:13:24.659
Did you make that up just now?

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:31.571
What do you do, Naomi?

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.872
Actually, I'm a dancer.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:38.769
<i>"N"called ''X"and said she'd had a dream,</i>

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:42.276
<i>"N"was so young,</i>

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.410
<i>and ''X"worried about her</i>

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:48.817
<i>because the dream was about</i>

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.922
<i>his father,</i>

01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:57.658
Can you dance for us, Naomi?

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.690
Yes, Carlo.

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:02.669
Dance for your maestro.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:39.032
<i>''X"never knew what hit him,</i>

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:45.008

01:14:58.126 --> 01:14:59.354

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:37.453
Look what I got you.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:43.990
You like bears, right?
Yeah, that's great.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:47.330
What are you doing?
I'm just reading some stuff.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.133
What are you reading?

01:16:57.846 --> 01:16:59.814
You go through my things?

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:09.449
How could you do this to me?

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:11.751
How could you go through my things?

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:15.990
I was in the house, I was looking around,
I found the suitcases.

01:17:16.264 --> 01:17:17.288
It was an accident.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:18.957
An accident?
Yeah.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:21.592
Can you read this?
Can you read my writing?

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:23.898
It's in the military school code.

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.867
Yeah, bullshit.
Wait, Tetro.

01:17:26.975 --> 01:17:28.636
Bullshit, you were.
Yeah, look...

01:17:28.744 --> 01:17:30.712
How could you do this to me?

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.542
How could you go through my things?
How could you go through my things?

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.879
An accident.
Accident!

01:17:36.618 --> 01:17:37.880
It wasn't an accident!

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:40.648
They're great stories.
They just... They don't have an ending.

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.087
They don't need an ending.

01:17:42.190 --> 01:17:44.283
Listen to me! No ending?

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:47.556
There doesn't have to be an ending, Bennie.
You know why?

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:50.131
Because my stories will never be published.

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:52.427
Who gave you this? Who gave you this?

01:17:52.534 --> 01:17:54.399
Where'd you get this?
Where'd you get this?

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:56.801
Where'd you get this?
It's my story, too!

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:59.430
Where'd you get this?
Where'd you get this?

01:17:59.541 --> 01:18:01.941
Miranda give this to you?
It's my story, too!

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:03.602
It's my story, too!
Did Miranda give it to you?

01:18:03.712 --> 01:18:05.009
Miranda?

01:18:05.113 --> 01:18:09.550
It's my story, it's my life,
and my father, and my mother!

01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:15.186
It's not fair, I don't know anything.
I don't know my mother and my father!

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:19.549
All I have is you,
and you're fucking crazy. I...

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.759
You little sneak!

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.128
I could punch you right in the face!

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:32.433
Shut up!

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:34.509
Did you give it to him, yes or no?

01:18:34.609 --> 01:18:35.701
I don't trust you anymore.
Okay...

01:18:35.811 --> 01:18:37.142
I don't trust you anymore.
Oh, no? Punch me!

01:18:37.245 --> 01:18:38.678
I don't trust you anymore.
I dare you. Come on.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:39.769
You dare me to punch you?
Come on.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:40.848
You're lucky I don't punch you.

01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:43.480
Listen to me! Listen to me!

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:46.679
Did you give him that? Did you give him it?
Did you give him that?

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:55.690
Come on, punch me!

01:18:56.131 --> 01:18:57.155
Did you give it to him?

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:01.333
Listen...
You get away from her! Get away from us!

01:19:01.436 --> 01:19:03.768
He's just had an accident, you idiot! Please!

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:06.363
You know who wrote this?
Angie wrote this crap!

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:09.239
Angie's dead! Angie's dead!

01:19:32.367 --> 01:19:34.858
This will take a while to blow over.

01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:44.374
You can't live with us anymore.

01:20:15.577 --> 01:20:16.771
Walk. Walk.

01:20:16.978 --> 01:20:18.445
One step.

01:20:20.182 --> 01:20:21.979
Sorry for the conditions in La Boca.

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:24.608
People live here in the Stone Ages.

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.484
Give me the crutches.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.434
You forgot your hat.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:47.231
You keep it as a souvenir.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.607
Thank you very much.

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:52.926
I'm so happy that you're working here.

01:22:56.905 --> 01:23:00.204
How's your writing going?
It's going well.

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:03.641
I almost have the ending,
and then it'll be done.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.747
I'm very close to Alone, by the way.

01:23:16.624 --> 01:23:18.854
Alone, the Patagonia Festival?

01:23:19.127 --> 01:23:20.617
I have her ear.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:29.170
How do you get submitted
for the Patagonia Festival?

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:14.607
<i>Wander Lust?</i>

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.661
Maybe you can do the lights?

01:24:45.647 --> 01:24:49.515
I want it short. Has to be short, black hair.
But I don't like short.

01:24:59.594 --> 01:25:01.687
No. Look at my hair.

01:25:04.632 --> 01:25:06.190
Bennie...
I want...

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.603
I heard you wrote a play.

01:25:10.805 --> 01:25:11.794
Yeah.

01:25:11.906 --> 01:25:14.170
If it's this one, you ripped it off.

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:17.472
Well, you weren't doing anything with it,
so I figured I'd just put my name on it.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:18.910
You put your name on it?
You said it was junk.

01:25:19.013 --> 01:25:21.481
I made some changes, I put an ending to it.
Yeah?

01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:24.950
Abelardo got it translated into Spanish.
You made some changes?

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.451
You made some changes?

01:25:28.456 --> 01:25:30.447
Changes? You made changes?

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:33.660
Changes! You made changes?
Yeah.

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:37.329
Well, you know, we can share the credit,
but my name first.

01:25:37.432 --> 01:25:40.094
You fucking little thief! You're a little thief!

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:41.896
And you're worse than a thief!
You're a plagiarist!

01:25:42.003 --> 01:25:44.904
You couldn't write the ending, so...
What ending? What ending?

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.234
The one that you couldn't face.

01:25:46.341 --> 01:25:49.401
My play doesn't need an ending.
My play will not be published.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:50.910
You hear me?

01:25:51.880 --> 01:25:52.847
Ending!

01:25:52.947 --> 01:25:58.613
Well, if you say it's your play,
then that's declaring that it's yours,

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.483
which means that you're publishing it.
Yeah, bullshit.

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.818
I'm going to save you, Tetro.
You gonna save me?

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:04.323
You save me?

01:26:05.059 --> 01:26:07.550
I'll fucking shove that up your throat!

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:09.721
You save me? Save yourself.

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:11.632
<i>Hello, Bennie,</i>

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.427
You fucking weasel!

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:17.232
Let me talk to her. Let me talk to her.
Fucking talk to her!

01:26:17.605 --> 01:26:20.005
Now talk to her. Go ahead, talk to her.
Talk to Alone.

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.769
Talk to Alone, your friend.

01:26:23.244 --> 01:26:24.211
<i>Hello, Bennie,</i>

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.639
Your new friend.

<i>Wander Lust</i> is one of the five finalists
for the Los Parricidas Prize.

01:26:38.193 --> 01:26:41.128
<i>It's one of the flnest plays I've ever read,</i>

01:26:41.663 --> 01:26:46.464
<i>In this one work, Tetro has</i>
<i>rejuvenated himself into a real writer,</i>

01:26:47.202 --> 01:26:48.726
<i>I am impressed,</i>

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.738
My brother's speechless.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:58.508
We're going to the festival in Patagonia!

01:27:03.885 --> 01:27:05.375
What's going on? What's going on?

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:58.260
I don't want Bennie to save me.

01:27:59.274 --> 01:28:01.572
I don't want anyone to save me.

01:28:03.177 --> 01:28:07.978
But this is exactly what I had hoped for,
what will cure you.

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:14.815
You think this will cure me?
Absolutely.

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.758
Am I not okay the way that I am?

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:24.931
Am I not famous enough?
Of course.

01:28:26.367 --> 01:28:31.430
I had a girlfriend once who was
very impressed with famous people.

01:28:34.809 --> 01:28:38.404
And one day,
a very famous person took her away.

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.008
Stole her from me.

01:28:46.454 --> 01:28:52.393
But it means so much to us,

01:28:53.695 --> 01:28:56.027
you know, your success, Tetro,

01:28:56.130 --> 01:29:00.726
to Bennie, to your friends...
To me, as well, yes.

01:29:01.369 --> 01:29:04.600
I understand this is your way
of showing love.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:07.034
Success,

01:29:08.943 --> 01:29:10.934
it's what you need, Tetro.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:19.679
If you had one word to give away,
just one word,

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:26.524
if this was that word,

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.265
who would you give it to?

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.051
I love you.

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.723
Maria Luisa!

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:39.061
You can squeeze into the back
with the boys.

01:30:39.167 --> 01:30:40.134
Okay.

01:30:45.139 --> 01:30:46.606
Hello, Tetro.

01:30:48.009 --> 01:30:49.806
How are you, my love?

01:30:51.045 --> 01:30:53.309
It's a joke. We are only lovers.

01:30:56.117 --> 01:30:57.311
It's a joke!

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:07.821
Hello.

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.563
Are you sad?

01:31:24.579 --> 01:31:26.240
Why Tetro is...

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:28.807
What?

01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.276
I don't know.

01:31:41.863 --> 01:31:42.989
Tetro?

01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:46.291
How can you get in love
with Miranda, Tetro?

01:31:46.701 --> 01:31:47.759
Why?

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:49.861
What Tetro have?

01:32:00.414 --> 01:32:02.939
Your father's office keeps calling.

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:05.541
It's serious.

01:32:05.653 --> 01:32:06.881
I know how you feel.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:10.446
But maybe Bennie wants to see him
before it's too late.

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.093
I'm...

01:32:21.402 --> 01:32:22.801
Bennie's...

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:24.932
He's...

01:32:33.714 --> 01:32:35.079
What is it?

01:32:46.928 --> 01:32:48.361
Are you cold?

01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.958
Sure?

01:32:53.200 --> 01:32:55.225
Give me a kiss.
What?

01:32:55.336 --> 01:32:57.099
Kiss me.
No.

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:11.677
Hey.

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:13.815
Kiss me.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:55.981
All they have are two rooms.

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:59.780
Each with beds for three people,
one double and one single.

01:36:22.543 --> 01:36:23.737
Bennie.

01:36:46.333 --> 01:36:47.493
Tetro?

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:52.799
Tetro?

01:36:59.113 --> 01:37:00.273
Tetro?

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:05.142
What do you think? Like this?

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:06.941
That's great.
Yes?

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:18.252
Or maybe like this.

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:23.320
Wow.

01:38:25.532 --> 01:38:29.468
Aunt Josefina told me that
we can have a pajama party tonight.

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:34.332
Yes.

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:38.669
Without pajamas.
No pajamas.

01:38:38.779 --> 01:38:39.837
Yes!

01:38:40.214 --> 01:38:43.012
And no pajamas.

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:44.607
No pajamas.

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.310
No pajamas.

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.745
Without pajama, baby.

01:38:48.856 --> 01:38:50.585
Come with us, Bambi.

01:38:52.092 --> 01:38:54.925
Look at his penis. Oh, yeah, yeah!

01:38:55.162 --> 01:38:56.789
Yeah, come on, baby.

01:38:57.131 --> 01:38:58.894
Come with us, Bambi.

01:39:49.717 --> 01:39:50.945
Miranda.

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:09.691
Bennie!

01:40:17.745 --> 01:40:20.873
Something's happened to your brother.
He's gone.

01:40:23.650 --> 01:40:25.743
I have no idea where he is.

01:41:01.021 --> 01:41:02.215
Bennie.

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:05.086
Josefina!

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:26.369
Hey, look!

01:42:58.772 --> 01:42:59.966
Cheers.

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.339
I love champagne.

01:45:10.537 --> 01:45:11.504
Hey.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:15.104
You said you put an ending on the story?

01:45:16.710 --> 01:45:19.235
Yeah, the ending is that you kill
your father. Okay?

01:45:19.346 --> 01:45:21.541
That's what the ending has to be. But the...

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:25.414
It's about to start right now, okay?
We can make it. Come on.

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:29.945
I'm gonna tell you straight, Bennie.

01:45:30.691 --> 01:45:32.488
I'm not your brother.

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:35.721
I'm your father.

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:40.798
Your mother,

01:45:44.938 --> 01:45:47.805
she was a girl that I loved when she was 18.

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:50.738
I was 20.

01:45:51.912 --> 01:45:54.176
I don't believe a word you say.

01:46:02.289 --> 01:46:04.018
Believe me, Bennie.

01:46:07.961 --> 01:46:08.985
No!

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:11.156
No!

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.425
No! No!

01:46:15.469 --> 01:46:18.267
You know the ending you wrote
in the play?

01:46:19.639 --> 01:46:21.470
The father gets killed?

01:46:21.575 --> 01:46:22.940
You're looking at him.

01:46:38.291 --> 01:46:39.553
You know,

01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:43.324
when you were a kid,

01:46:44.731 --> 01:46:46.961
I thought you were my brother.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:49.200
That's what I was told.

01:46:50.537 --> 01:46:52.129
And I loved you.

01:46:53.707 --> 01:46:55.698
I loved having a brother.

01:46:56.410 --> 01:46:58.275
I took you everywhere.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.987
And then she told us,

01:47:15.262 --> 01:47:16.661
she told me,

01:47:18.432 --> 01:47:20.491
and she told him the truth.

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:29.465
She took an overdose.

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.374
<i>And when your mother was sick,</i>

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:49.112
I left her.

01:49:56.022 --> 01:49:57.114
Kill me.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:03.925
If that's the way you want the story to end,

01:50:04.497 --> 01:50:06.226
you have to kill me.

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.233
Kill me, Bennie.

01:50:10.337 --> 01:50:11.565
Kill me.

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:25.217
You're my son.

01:50:32.425 --> 01:50:34.290
You're my son, Bennie.

01:51:13.466 --> 01:51:15.127
I'm sorry, Bennie.

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:24.101
I'm really sorry.

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.438
One moment.

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:03.601
Tetro!

01:53:04.210 --> 01:53:06.235
You are safe, darling.

01:53:36.910 --> 01:53:38.036
Move...

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:40.840
When you move too quickly towards me,

01:53:41.247 --> 01:53:44.375
I'm not sure if you're going to
give me a passionate kiss

01:53:44.784 --> 01:53:46.684
or a punch in the nose.

01:53:48.588 --> 01:53:51.056
I only have respect for you, Alone.

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:54.820
He once did threaten me with violence.

01:53:56.196 --> 01:53:57.993
It was very exciting.

01:54:01.634 --> 01:54:03.465
You turned against me.

01:54:04.204 --> 01:54:06.729
You hadn't lived up to your promise.

01:54:07.140 --> 01:54:08.573
Now you have.

01:54:11.845 --> 01:54:13.005
With one play...

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:14.079
Yes, it is.

01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:17.513
...you've made second rate
all the new young writers.

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:21.580
If my opinion matters to you.

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:34.430
Of course.

01:54:51.417 --> 01:54:54.181
Your opinion doesn't
matter to me anymore.

01:57:38.918 --> 01:57:40.579
Here, Uncle Alfie.

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:42.719
You take it.

01:57:48.561 --> 01:57:50.529
I don't know what to do.

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.998
Just take it.

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.971
I would have had him give it to me.

01:58:00.373 --> 01:58:01.499
Yeah.

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:04.967
What has happened to our family?

01:59:08.007 --> 01:59:09.804
We were so promising,

01:59:12.578 --> 01:59:14.808
we loved each other so much.

01:59:15.081 --> 01:59:17.049
I don't know what to do.

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:20.452
I don't know what to do.

01:59:25.625 --> 01:59:27.354
What was in our way?

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:34.460
Rivalry.

01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:38.968
Here he is.

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:41.737
Aunt Lily.

01:59:44.443 --> 01:59:46.570
Do you remember Uncle Alfie?

01:59:48.614 --> 01:59:50.912
Pop sent Bennie away to prep school.

01:59:56.055 --> 01:59:57.215
Bennie?

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:03.124
How about a Tootsie Roll, sonny?

02:00:20.213 --> 02:00:22.340
My grandfather did something.

02:00:23.382 --> 02:00:26.180
Something that I need to tell you about.

02:00:26.285 --> 02:00:28.378
Your father, you mean.
No.

02:00:29.422 --> 02:00:30.548
Him.

02:00:30.656 --> 02:00:33.955
Carlo Tetrocini, my grandfather.

02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:36.387
Your grandfather?

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:41.789
He stole my poor mother away from Tetro.

02:00:42.702 --> 02:00:45.034
Bennie, what are you saying?

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.502
What are you saying?

02:00:52.044 --> 02:00:55.309
That's not true.
True? Amalia?

02:00:55.414 --> 02:00:59.350
Yes, it's true. And you know it
because you were a part of it.

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:00.817
The deceit.

02:01:02.255 --> 02:01:04.155
It was for Angie's...

02:01:04.257 --> 02:01:06.350
It was for Angie's own good.

02:01:07.026 --> 02:01:09.153
It was for Angie's own good.

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.628
Don't call him Angie. He's...

02:01:14.734 --> 02:01:16.292
He doesn't want to be
called Angie anymore.

02:01:16.402 --> 02:01:17.733
His name's Tetro.

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:20.169
And him, the Great One.

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:25.369
He stole her away from him
just because he could.

02:01:36.989 --> 02:01:39.787
Tetro is your father, Bennie?

02:01:40.826 --> 02:01:43.021
How could he have understood?

02:01:48.034 --> 02:01:49.228
Bennie.

02:02:02.348 --> 02:02:03.406
God.

02:02:04.150 --> 02:02:05.310
Bennie.

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:08.514
Bennie!

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:33.974
Fuck you!

02:02:48.594 --> 02:02:49.788
Bennie!

02:02:59.138 --> 02:03:00.628
Hey.
No.

02:03:06.712 --> 02:03:07.906
Bennie!

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:35.898
Bennie, no!

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:10.031
You can't look at the light.

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.932
Don't look at the light.

02:05:12.037 --> 02:05:13.902
Bennie. Bennie.

02:05:19.411 --> 02:05:20.878
You're my son.

02:05:22.081 --> 02:05:23.708
Come on, let's go.

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.214
It's gonna be okay.

02:05:29.522 --> 02:05:31.046
We're a family.
