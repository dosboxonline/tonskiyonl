In "Jailhouse Rock",
he was everything rockabilly is about.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.454
I mean, he is rockabilly.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.541
Mean, surly, nasty, rude.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.335
In that movie,
he couldn't give a fuck about nothing.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.213
Except rocking and rolling,
living fast, dying young

01:28.338 --> 01:30.090
and leaving a good-looking corpse,
you know?

01:34.886 --> 01:37.848
I watch that hillbilly
and I wanna be him so bad.

01:39.891 --> 01:41.893
Elvis looked good.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.898
Hey, I ain't no fag.
But Elvis was prettier than most women.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.400
You know? Most women.

01:52.195 --> 01:56.533
You know, I always said, if I had
to fuck a guy, I mean, had to...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.827
if my life depended on it...

01:59.953 --> 02:01.872
I'd fuck Elvis.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.916
I'd fuck Elvis.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.880
- Really?
- Well, when he was alive, not now.

02:10.797 --> 02:13.050
I don't blame you.

02:13.175 --> 02:15.802
So, we'd both fuck Elvis.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.543
It's nice to meet people
with common interests, ain't it?

02:22.643 --> 02:24.770
Well, enough about the King.
How about you?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.524
How about me what?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.695
How about you go to the movies
with me tonight?

02:35.614 --> 02:37.574
What are we gonna see?

02:37.699 --> 02:39.618
A Sonny Chiba triple feature.

02:39.743 --> 02:41.828
"The Street Fighter",
"Return of the Street Fighter",

02:41.953 --> 02:44.081
and "Sister Street Fighter".

02:45.248 --> 02:47.042
Who's Sonny Chiba?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.960
Who's Sonny Chiba?

02:49.086 --> 02:53.882
Well, he is, bar none, the finest actor
working in martial arts movies today.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.344
You wanna take me
to a kung fu movie?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.848
Three kung fu movies.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.729
I don't think so.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.732
Not really my cup of tea.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.610
All right.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.505
'I had to come all the way

'That's the way romance is.

- That's OK.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.398
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:38.523 --> 06:40.984
Oh, Jesus, I am the clumsiest person
in the world.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.528
That's all right. Accidents happen.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.741
What a wonderful philosophy.
Thanks for being such a sweetheart.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.868
Cos you could've been a real dick.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.454
- 'Come on! Ready?'
- 'Yes.'

06:53.747 --> 06:55.707
'Larry, where are we going?'

07:06.635 --> 07:10.555
'Look, we don't know
what's going to be coming next.'

07:10.680 --> 07:14.392
- 'You mean, you're scared?'
- 'Hey, laundromat clothes!'

07:15.226 --> 07:17.103
You mind if I smoke?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.230
No.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.816
Listen, do you mind filling me in
on what I missed?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.277
No, no.

07:26.780 --> 07:30.742
See this, that guy up there?
It's Sonny Chiba.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.287
- The Oriental?
- Yeah, the one in black.

07:35.914 --> 07:37.332
You want a Goober?

07:37.457 --> 07:43.338
Uh, no. See, in the beginning of the movie
he was hired to get this guy.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.256
You've got popcorn all over you.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.884
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.263
Is he supposed to be a good guy?

07:52.389 --> 07:55.475
Well, he ain't so much a good guy
as he's just a bad motherfucker.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.353
He gets paid by people
to fuck guys up, you know.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.192
Whoo! Woo!

08:04.317 --> 08:06.820

to see three kung fu movies?

08:07.529 --> 08:09.239
Sure, why not?

08:09.364 --> 08:12.242
Nothing, nothing. You're a girl

08:13.702 --> 08:17.539
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's about 12.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.959
I suppose you've gotta get up early, huh?

08:21.084 --> 08:23.712
No, no, not particularly. How come?

08:25.130 --> 08:27.924
It's just after I see a movie,
I like to go get a piece of pie

08:28.049 --> 08:31.720
and talk about it,
it's sort of a little tradition I have.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.847
Do you like to get pie
after you see a good movie?

08:35.557 --> 08:37.892
Yeah, I love to get pie after a movie.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.813
Would you like to go
get some pie with me?

- I don't know.

09:31.780 --> 09:36.284
- What's your favourite colour?
- I don't know. Black?

09:36.409 --> 09:38.649
- Well, who's your favourite movie star?
- Burt Reynolds.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.747

09:41.331 --> 09:43.374
Yes, I would. A little one.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.838
- You all right? It's good.
- Mm-hm.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.465
- You like it?
- Mm-hm.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.467
What kind of music do you like?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.428

09:59.265 --> 10:03.311

10:07.816 --> 10:08.900
Tu rn-offs?

10:10.235 --> 10:12.904
- Turn-offs.
- Mm-hm.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.447
Persians.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.328
Do you have a fella?

10:20.870 --> 10:23.623
Ask me that one a little bit later.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.753
In a theatre full of empty seats,
why did you sit by me?

10:30.130 --> 10:32.132
Cos you looked like a nice guy.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.427
So I had to dump
my popcorn all over you.

10:40.682 --> 10:43.226
I'll get the check. Where to next?

10:44.018 --> 10:45.103
Can I peek?

10:45.228 --> 10:48.481
No, don't peek.
Keep your eyes shut, all right?

10:48.606 --> 10:52.277
All right, I'm turning the lights on.
OK, open 'em!

10:53.153 --> 10:54.988
Oh, wow!

10:55.572 --> 10:58.408
Wow, what a swell place to work!

10:59.325 --> 11:00.678
Yeah, it is pretty cool.
I got the keys,

11:00.702 --> 11:03.621
so I just come in, you know,
read comics, play music.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.500
- You worked here a long time?
- Almost four years.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.420
That's a long time.

11:10.545 --> 11:13.256
Yeah, I know, but it's not so bad.
I mean, I'm pretty friendly

11:13.381 --> 11:15.401
with most of the customers,
so I just hang out, you know,

11:15.425 --> 11:17.385
bullshit, read comic books.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.179
You get paid a lot?

11:20.305 --> 11:22.724
No, that's where the trouble
comes into paradise.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.685
But the boss, he's a pretty nice guy,
he lets you borrow money

11:25.810 --> 11:27.979
from time to time, if you need it.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.069
You wanna see what
"Spider-Man" #1 looks like?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.197
You bet.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.326
Just great stories,
great characters, beautiful artwork.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.329
See, in this one here, Nick,
he's gotten this ring

11:44.454 --> 11:48.166
for his sweetheart and he wears it
around his neck on a chain.

11:48.291 --> 11:52.253
And later on in the story, he gets
in this fight with some Nazi bastard.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.339
And the Kraut,
he grabs hold of the chain.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.216
Well, the ring goes overboard.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.763
Nick, he dives into the ocean to get it.

I didn't just happen to be at that theatre.
I was paid to be there.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.516

A theatre checker?

14:10.641 --> 14:12.643

OK, here it goes. You know the place
you took me to last night?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.372
The place you work.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.333

- You got a boss, right?

14:35.458 --> 14:37.668
- Yeah.
- OK, what's his name?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.587
Lance.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.006
That's him.
He called the place where I work.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.675
He ordered a girl for you.
He said he wanted you to get laid.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.054
Said you didn't get out much,
and it was your birthday and all.

14:50.098 --> 14:51.974
He wanted me to act
like I just showed up.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.061
Now, how did he know
you were gonna be at that theatre?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.230
Well, I go to the movies
every year on my birthday.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.357
In fact, he called me up
this week to find out

14:59.482 --> 15:01.567
what my birthday movie
was gonna be.

15:01.692 --> 15:03.903
You're not mad?

15:04.028 --> 15:08.658
No, man. I can't tell you, that was
one of the best times I ever had.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.911
It was. You know, I knew something
must be rotten in Denmark.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.038
There's no way
you could like me that much.

15:14.497 --> 15:16.207
I can't tell you how relieved I was,

15:16.332 --> 15:19.001
when you took off your dress,
you didn't have a dick.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.295
Stop being so fucking calm
about all this!

15:21.421 --> 15:23.631
Go look in your house.
There's a note on your TV.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.717
And all it says is, "Dear Clarence,"
because I couldn't write any more.

15:26.843 --> 15:29.262
So I just said, "Alabama, come clean."

15:29.387 --> 15:31.639
And just tell him what's what,
and if he tells you

15:31.764 --> 15:35.393
to go back to Drexl and fuck yourself,
then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.812

15:37.937 --> 15:40.106

I'm trying to come clean, OK?

15:40.231 --> 15:43.359
I've been a call girl for exactly four
days, and you're my third customer.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.155

16:14.348 --> 16:17.226
Now I gotta tell you something else.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.979
When you said last night was
one of the best times you ever had,

16:20.104 --> 16:21.564
did you mean physically?

16:21.689 --> 16:25.193
Well... yeah, yeah.
But I'm talking about the whole night.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.614
I mean, I never had as much fun with a girl
as I had with you my whole life.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.284
It's true, you like Elvis,
you like Janis,

16:33.409 --> 16:37.163
you like kung fu movies,
you like "The Partridge Family"!

16:37.288 --> 16:41.292
Actually, I don't like
"The Partridge Family".

16:41.417 --> 16:43.878
That was part of the act.

16:46.589 --> 16:48.424
Clarence...

16:48.883 --> 16:51.469
And I feel really goofy saying this

16:51.594 --> 16:57.183
after only knowing you one night,
and me being a call girl and all.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.770
But I think I love you.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.654
Wait a second.

17:11.739 --> 17:15.785
Look, I've been trying to keep
this whole thing in perspective.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.161
You just said you loved me.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.473
Now, if I say I love you,
and just throw caution to the wind

17:19.497 --> 17:20.936
and let the chips fall
where they may

17:21.040 --> 17:23.334
and you're lying to me,
I'm gonna fucking die.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.502
I'm not lying to you.

17:25.627 --> 17:30.550
And I swear from this moment forth,
I'll never lie to you again.

17:43.646 --> 17:47.066
- Well, hello, Mrs Worley.
- How do you do, Mr Worley?

17:47.191 --> 17:50.903
- Top of the morning to you, Mrs Worley.
- The bottom of the night, Mr Worley.

17:51.028 --> 17:53.322
By the way, have you seen
your lovely little wife today?

17:53.447 --> 17:56.659
Are you speaking of my beautiful,
charming, sexy wife, Mrs Alabama Worley?

17:56.784 --> 17:59.787
- Why, are there any others, Mr Worley?
- No, not for me, no.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.914
- No. No.
- Yes, yes.

18:10.047 --> 18:14.135
Excuse me. Do you think you could
turn down the heat just a teeny bit?

18:18.723 --> 18:21.601
Bama, I gotta ask you a question.
Who and what is a Drexl?

18:21.726 --> 18:23.936
- Shh!
- Huh?

18:24.061 --> 18:27.023
- He was my pimp.
- You had a pimp?

18:29.400 --> 18:30.901
I was a call girl.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.279
Call girls have pimps.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.780
Was he black?

18:34.905 --> 18:38.993
He thinks he is. He said his mama was
an Apache, but I suspect that he's lying.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.162
Is he nice?

18:41.912 --> 18:46.250
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He treated me pretty decent.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.253
I was only there for four days.
He got a little bit rough the other day.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.340
- What do you mean? With you?
- No, with my friend Arlene.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.301
What did he do to Arlene?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.613
Slapped her around a little bit.
Kicked her in the stomach.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.932
- It was pretty scary.
- This motherfucker sounds beautiful.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.646
What did you do to end up
with a son of a bitch like that?

19:10.066 --> 19:11.776
What you motherfuckers talking about?

19:11.901 --> 19:14.403
Floyd say he don't be eating pussy.

19:14.528 --> 19:18.658
Drexl... shit, any nigger says
he don't eat pussy's lying his ass off.

19:18.783 --> 19:19.950
I heard that.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.911
Hold on a second.
Big D, you saying

19:22.036 --> 19:23.036
you eat pussy?

19:23.079 --> 19:26.290
Yeah, motherfucker, I eat everything.
I eat the pussy, I eat the butt.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.042
I eat every motherfucking thing.

19:28.167 --> 19:31.671
If I ever did eat some pussy...
I would never eat any pussy, right?

19:31.796 --> 19:33.547
But if I did eat some pussy,

19:33.673 --> 19:36.384
I sure as hell wouldn't tell
no-goddamn-body about it.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.678
I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker, man.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.283
Shit, nigger, you smoke enough sherm,

19:40.388 --> 19:42.932
your dumb ass will do
a lot of motherfucking things.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.726
You'd be up in there
sucking niggers' dicks!

19:48.729 --> 19:51.982
Yo, man, fuck you guys, man!
You guys are fucked up, all right?

19:52.108 --> 19:54.308
Hey, yo. Yo. Wait a second.
We're just fucking with you.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.945
Huh?

19:56.070 --> 19:59.949
In fact, I'm gonna show you
what I mean with a little demonstration.

20:00.074 --> 20:01.492
Toss me the burner.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.622
All right, peep this.

20:07.957 --> 20:11.711
Pretend it's that fine, centrefold bitch.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.506
You know what I'm saying?
And you're you...

21:00.718 --> 21:03.053
- Honey, where you going?
- Bathroom.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.699
♪ Well, I'm so lonely

21:23.824 --> 21:27.161
♪ I get so lonely, I could die ♪

21:28.370 --> 21:31.791
- Well, can you live with it?
- What?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.585
- I said can you live with it?
- Live with what?

21:34.710 --> 21:38.214
That son of a bitch walking
around breathing the same air as you.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.341
Getting away with it every day.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.886
- Are you haunted?
- Yeah.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.972
You wanna get un-haunted?

21:47.807 --> 21:51.060
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, I'd kill him.

21:51.185 --> 21:54.063
Shoot him in the face,
put him down like a dog.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.524
I can't believe what you're telling me.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.026
I'm not saying nothing.
I'm just saying what I'd do.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.528
You'd do that?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.905
The fuck don't deserve to live.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.492
Look, he's haunting me, you know.

22:07.284 --> 22:10.412
I do wanna kill him, but I don't wanna
spend the rest of my life in jail.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.373
Hey, man, I don't blame you.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.501
- If I thought I'd get away with it...
- Get away with it?

22:15.626 --> 22:19.421
Killing's the hard part.
Getting away with it, that's easy.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.007
You think a cop gives a fuck
about a pimp?

22:23.175 --> 22:26.053
Listen. Every pimp in the world
could get shot.

22:26.554 --> 22:30.558
Two in the back of the fucking head.
Cops would throw a party, man.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.604
As long as you're not
at the scene of the crime

22:35.729 --> 22:37.731
with a smoking gun in your hand,

22:37.857 --> 22:39.692
you'll get away with it.

22:39.817 --> 22:41.986
Clarence, I like you.

22:42.111 --> 22:45.239
Always have, always will.

23:09.889 --> 23:11.390
Bama...

23:11.515 --> 23:12.850
Where you going?

23:15.561 --> 23:18.355
I need you to write down
your former address.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.480
Why?

23:19.940 --> 23:23.027
Well, so I can go over there
and pick up your stuff, that's why.

23:23.152 --> 23:27.072
Oh, baby, come on, Clarence.
I just wanna disappear from there.

23:27.197 --> 23:29.077
Look, Bama, I know he scares
the shit outta you,

23:29.158 --> 23:30.826
but I am not scared
of that motherfucker.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.955
You are completely out of his reach.
He poses absolutely no threat to you.

23:35.080 --> 23:36.749
If he doesn't matter,
which he doesn't,

23:36.874 --> 23:39.352
then it just seems silly to lose
all your things now, that's all.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.878
Shh! Listen.

23:42.212 --> 23:43.839
You don't know him.

23:43.964 --> 23:47.343
No, you don't know me.
Not when it comes to shit like this.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.304
I need to do this.

23:50.429 --> 23:54.099
I want you to know that
you can count on me to protect you.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.855
Come on, please just write it down.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.615
This isn't a good idea.

24:10.824 --> 24:14.495
I'm telling you, it's gonna be fine.
I'll be in and out of there.

24:17.373 --> 24:19.708
- Be careful.
- I will.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.215
- I love you.
- I love you too.

25:29.987 --> 25:31.989
Do you want something?

25:32.114 --> 25:34.408
- Yeah, you Drexl?
- No, man, I'm Marty.

25:35.242 --> 25:36.785
Well, I wanna talk to Drexl.

25:36.910 --> 25:38.912
Well, what the fuck
you wanna talk to him about?

25:40.497 --> 25:42.332
It's about Alabama.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.391
He was asking about Alabama.

26:01.310 --> 26:04.730
- Where the fuck is that bitch?
- She's with me.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.399
Who the fuck are you?

26:07.524 --> 26:09.693
I'm her husband.

26:13.113 --> 26:15.699
Well, that makes us practically related.

26:17.993 --> 26:20.662
Have a seat, boy.
You have yourself an egg roll.

26:20.788 --> 26:23.749
We got everything here from
a diddle-eyed Joe to damned if I know.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.168
No, thanks.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.425
No, thanks? What that mean?

26:34.927 --> 26:36.804
I think you're too scared to be eating.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.270
Now, see...

26:45.395 --> 26:49.274
We're sitting down here,
ready to negotiate.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.402
And you've already given up your shit.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.571
I'm still a mystery to you.

26:54.696 --> 26:57.825
But I know exactly where
your white ass is coming from.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.576
See, if I ask if you want some dinner

26:59.785 --> 27:01.787
and you grab an egg roll
and start to chow down,

27:01.912 --> 27:04.015
I say to myself, "This motherfucker,
he's carrying on like he ain't got"

27:04.039 --> 27:06.959
"a care in the world."
And who knows? Maybe he don't.

27:07.918 --> 27:13.966
Maybe this fool is such a bad motherfucker,
he don't got to worry about nothing.

27:14.091 --> 27:17.427
He just sit down,
watch my motherfucking TV.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.513
See?

27:22.057 --> 27:24.393
You ain't even sat down yet.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.271
And on that TV over there,
since you've been in the room,

27:27.396 --> 27:30.274
there's a woman with her breasts
just hanging out.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.068
You ain't even bothered to look.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.904
You just been clocking me.

27:39.449 --> 27:43.954
Now, I know I'm pretty. But I ain't
as pretty as a couple of titties.

27:46.456 --> 27:49.376
Ooh-ee! This child be fierce.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.515
I'm not eating because I'm not hungry.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.240
I'm not sitting because I'm not staying.

28:05.434 --> 28:09.354
I ain't looking at the movie because
I already seen it seven years ago.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.731
It's "The Mack".

28:10.856 --> 28:13.066
Max Julian, Carol Speed
and Richard Pryor.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.154
I ain't scared of you,
I just don't like you.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.573
And that envelope right there,
it's some pay-off money.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.617
Alabama's moving on
to some greener pastures.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.619
We're not negotiating,
I don't like to barter.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.513
What's in the envelope right there
is for my peace of mind.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.832
My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.136
It's empty-

28:50.270 --> 28:54.775
Marty, you know what we got here?
A motherfucking Charlie Bronson.

28:57.110 --> 28:58.612
Mr Majestyk?

28:59.613 --> 29:02.366
Lookie here... Charlie.

29:03.116 --> 29:07.496
None of this bullshit is necessary.
I don't got no hold over Alabama.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.916
I was just trying to lend a girl
a helping hand.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.134
You wanna fuck with me?

29:43.448 --> 29:45.117
Come here, mutha!

30:09.850 --> 30:14.896
Now, you see what you get
when you fuck with me, white boy!

30:15.022 --> 30:18.400
Look at this! Making fun
of my motherfucking peeps?

30:18.525 --> 30:22.279
Shit! You motherfucker!
Your ass fucking crazy!

30:30.996 --> 30:32.873
You must've thought
it was white-boy day.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.169
It ain't white-boy day, is it?

30:37.294 --> 30:39.421
No, man, it ain't white-boy day.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.215
Shit, man,
you done fucked up again.

30:58.732 --> 31:00.150
Well, well, well.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.487
Lookie what we got here.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.115
Clarence Worley?

31:09.076 --> 31:11.745
It sounds almost like a nigger name.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.456
And I know where you live.

31:14.581 --> 31:20.170
4900, 160th Street.
Apartment 48.

31:21.129 --> 31:25.175
And I'd make a million-dollar bet
that Alabama is at the same address.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.804
Marty, take the car, go get her.
Bring her dumb ass back here.

31:30.430 --> 31:32.724
I think I'll keep lover boy here
entertained.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.352
Roxanne, where's my jacket?

31:35.477 --> 31:37.521
Hey, Roxanne!

31:37.646 --> 31:40.190
Hey, Marty!
What the fuck are you doing?

31:40.482 --> 31:42.763
- I can't find my jacket!
- Go look in the fucking hamper.

31:52.869 --> 31:56.081
You! Get a bag
and put Alabama's things in it.

31:56.206 --> 31:59.668
You wanna get fucking shot?
Get a bag and put Alabama's things in it!

31:59.793 --> 32:02.796
I just did you the biggest
fucking favour of your life!

32:04.840 --> 32:07.008
Open your eyes.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.094
I said, open your fucking eyes!

32:10.345 --> 32:12.764
You thought it was pretty fucking funny,
didn't you?

32:12.889 --> 32:16.601
Fuck you!
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

32:20.439 --> 32:21.982
Don't fucking move!

32:22.441 --> 32:26.945
'I was selfish.
I know I was selfish. I was, but...

32:28.196 --> 32:30.407
'I was carrying your child, babe.'

32:41.877 --> 32:43.670
I killed him.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.339
Want a hamburger or something?
I'm fucking starving to death.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.341
Is this a joke?

32:48.467 --> 32:50.218
No joke.

32:50.343 --> 32:55.140
Hmm! That's the best goddamn fucking
hamburger I ever had in my entire life.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.767
I've never had a hamburger
taste this good.

32:58.477 --> 33:01.104
Come on, eat something,
you'll feel better.

33:06.359 --> 33:10.197
What the fuck you crying for, huh?

33:10.322 --> 33:12.616
I mean, Christ, he's not worth
one of your tears.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.576
Would you rather it have been me?
Is that it?

33:14.701 --> 33:17.579
Huh? Is that what you want?
I mean, do you love him?

33:17.704 --> 33:19.789
Do you love him?

33:19.915 --> 33:22.292
I said, do you fucking love him? Huh?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.586
- I think what you did was...
- What?

33:24.794 --> 33:26.922
- I think what you did...
- What?

33:27.672 --> 33:30.509
Was so romantic.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.643
Oh, baby, you're bleeding.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.148
I got your things right here.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.112
Clean clothes?

33:51.238 --> 33:55.367
- I love you.
- I love you. There is a God.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.061
These aren't my clothes.

34:43.623 --> 34:45.708
Rommel, where are you?
Come here. Come on, boy.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.502
Get in here. Get in here now.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.462
Get in here. Go on!

35:18.867 --> 35:20.452
Morning, Daddy.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.331
Hey, Rommel.
Long time no see, huh?

35:24.456 --> 35:26.541
Oh, yeah, good boy.

35:31.338 --> 35:33.840
Now, you're gonna have
to excuse the place.

35:34.883 --> 35:40.597
I haven't been exactly doing a lot
of entertainment of company as of late.

35:41.514 --> 35:44.392
I'm sorry if I seem a little tense,

35:44.517 --> 35:49.105
but you're the last person in the world
that I expected to see this morning.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.941
Well, that's OK, Daddy,
I tend to have that effect on people.

35:52.776 --> 35:55.779
You got anything to drink around here?
I'm dying of thirst.

35:55.945 --> 36:00.325
Now, there should be...
There should be a 7UP in there.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.828
Anything stronger? Probably not.

36:03.953 --> 36:06.831
Beer. You can drink beer, can't you?

36:06.956 --> 36:09.959
I can, but I don't.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.172
That's about all I ever eat.

36:15.632 --> 36:17.926
Excuse me.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.844
Hello, hello, hello.

36:19.969 --> 36:22.514
I'm his father.

36:22.639 --> 36:27.602
Well, that's all right. I'm his wife,
Alabama Worley. Pleased to meet you.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.772
We got married.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.500
Lover, why don't you be a sport
and go get us some beer?

36:50.625 --> 36:52.377
You want some beer?

36:52.502 --> 36:54.587
I mean, if you want some,
it'll be here. All right?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.589
Where is there a liquor store
around here?

36:56.715 --> 36:59.426
There is a party store
down 54th Street.

37:00.593 --> 37:03.346
Get a six-pack
of something imported.

37:03.471 --> 37:06.975
Hard to tell you what to get,
cos different places have different things.

37:07.100 --> 37:11.479
- Here, that should cover it, okey-dokey?
- Okey-dokey, doggy daddy.

37:22.115 --> 37:26.202
Ain't she the sweetest goddamn thing
you ever saw in your whole life?

37:26.411 --> 37:29.122
I mean, is she a four-alarm fire,
or what?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.792
She seems very nice.

37:33.835 --> 37:38.131
Nice? Daddy, nice ain't the word.
This girl, she's a peach.

37:38.882 --> 37:41.843
You know, she even tastes like a peach.

37:41.968 --> 37:45.013
You can tell I'm in love with her,
can't you?

37:46.222 --> 37:48.183
No, wait. I gotta talk.

37:48.308 --> 37:52.604
Clarence... Sit down. Shut up.

37:53.521 --> 37:55.648
You give me a fucking headache.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.444
I mean, you are so much
like your mother, I can't believe it.

37:59.569 --> 38:01.905
You're your fucking mother
through and through.

38:02.030 --> 38:05.074
I haven't heard from you
in three years.

38:06.159 --> 38:09.037
You show up all of a sudden,
at eight o'clock in the morning,

38:09.287 --> 38:12.540
you walk in here
like a goddamned bulldozer.

38:12.791 --> 38:16.461
Now, don't get me wrong,
I love you, I'm glad to see you.

38:18.004 --> 38:20.423
But slow it down, man.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.468
All right?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.429
Now...

38:29.307 --> 38:32.185
When did you get married?

38:33.436 --> 38:35.605
Well, Daddy, er...

38:38.483 --> 38:43.863
I'm in big fucking trouble.
I just... I really need your help.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.824
No, no, stop talking!

38:49.494 --> 38:51.246
- What do you want from me?
- What?

38:51.371 --> 38:54.916
What do you want from me?
Stop acting like an infant!

38:55.041 --> 38:57.919
You're out here because you want me
to help you in some way.

38:58.044 --> 39:00.129
What do you need from me?
You need money?

39:00.255 --> 39:02.799
No. You still have friends
on the force?

39:02.924 --> 39:04.801
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

39:04.926 --> 39:07.178
Could you just find out
if they know anything about us?

39:07.303 --> 39:10.157
I don't think they know shit. But I don't
wanna think, I wanna know for sure.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.975
You can do that, right?

39:12.100 --> 39:15.395
- What makes you think that I could do that?
- Cos you were a cop.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.731
But what makes you think
that I would do that?

39:19.482 --> 39:21.234
Because I'm your son.

39:21.442 --> 39:23.486
Oh, you're my son.

39:23.611 --> 39:28.157
Oh, you got it all worked out, don't you?
Huh? Oh, yeah.

39:28.283 --> 39:32.203
Look. I mean, goddamn, I've never
asked you for a goddamn thing, huh?

39:32.328 --> 39:34.664
But Jesus fucking Christ!
After Mom divorced you,

39:34.789 --> 39:37.542
did I ever ask you for anything?
No. I didn't.

39:37.667 --> 39:40.295
And when I wouldn't see you
for a year-and-a-half to two years,

39:40.420 --> 39:42.046
did I ever get in your shit about it?

39:42.171 --> 39:44.358
In that whole fucking time
you were a drunk, did I ever get mad

39:44.382 --> 39:48.678
and point my finger at you? No! I never
did. Everybody else did, but I didn't.

39:48.803 --> 39:51.764
Now look, I just need help,
and you can fucking help me. All right?

39:52.891 --> 39:56.519
Now, I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy.
If I didn't really need it, I wouldn't ask.

39:58.104 --> 40:01.691
I mean, if you want to say no,
then fine.

40:01.816 --> 40:05.278
Forget it, don't worry about it.
No problem, I'm gone, all right?

40:11.117 --> 40:12.827
The forager's back!

40:14.412 --> 40:16.972
Thank God. I could eat a horse,
if you slap enough ketchup on it.

40:17.123 --> 40:20.251
- I didn't get you any chicken.
- Well, how come?

40:20.376 --> 40:23.296
Honey, it's too early in the morning.
It's only nine o'clock.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.423
Son of a bitch.

40:32.305 --> 40:35.183
Dick Ritchie? Dick Ritchie!

40:35.308 --> 40:36.643
That's me, I'm me.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.729
- Come inside.
- OK.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.321
Sit. Sit, Sit, Sit.

40:48.446 --> 40:52.200
Now, the part you will be reading for
is one of the bad guys.

40:52.325 --> 40:54.410
- There's Brian and Marty.
- Who?

40:55.286 --> 40:58.206
- Is there a problem?
- No, no.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.708
Peter Breck has already been cast
in the part of Brian.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.752
So, you'll be reading
for the role of Marty.

41:02.877 --> 41:07.507
In this scene, you're both in a car,
and Bill Shatner is hanging on the hood.

41:07.632 --> 41:10.301
What you want to do is get him off.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.178
All right, I'm Marty.

41:13.930 --> 41:15.974
- Ready?
- Yeah.

41:16.099 --> 41:17.767
OK.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.270
I'm driving. OK.

41:22.438 --> 41:24.023
Where the fuck did he come from?

41:24.148 --> 41:26.109
I don't know,
he just appeared like magic.

41:26.234 --> 41:29.112
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him!

41:30.488 --> 41:32.657
- Get him!
- Thank you, Mr Ritchie.

41:32.865 --> 41:36.285
I'm very impressed.
You're a very fine actor.

41:37.370 --> 41:40.039
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:40.999 --> 41:43.626
- We'll let you know.
- OK.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.795
- OK, one-handed.
- One hand.

41:46.462 --> 41:50.550
Oh! Slipped in the other one there.
Here comes the train.

42:01.019 --> 42:05.898
Well, they found nothing.
In fact, they think it's drug related.

42:06.816 --> 42:08.693
Drug related? Why drug related?

42:08.818 --> 42:12.030
Well, apparently Drexl had
his big toe stuck in that shit.

42:12.155 --> 42:13.406
Really?

42:13.531 --> 42:17.326
Drexl had an association
with a fellow named Blue Lou Boyle.

42:17.452 --> 42:19.912
- Name mean anything to you?
- No.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.518
Well, if you don't hang around his circle,
no reason it should.

42:22.582 --> 42:23.582
Why? Who is he?

42:23.708 --> 42:26.502
Gangster, drug dealer. Somebody
that you don't want on your ass.

42:26.627 --> 42:31.215
Now look, Clarence,
the more I hear about this Drexl fucker,

42:31.340 --> 42:33.092
the more I think you did the right thing.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.053
This guy wasn't just some wild flake.

42:36.012 --> 42:38.073
No, man, that's what
I was trying to tell you before.

42:38.097 --> 42:40.224
The guy was like a mad dog.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.770
So, the cops, they don't think...
They're not after us.

42:44.062 --> 42:46.522
No. Until they hear something better,

42:46.647 --> 42:50.026
they'll just assume Drexl had
a falling out with Blue Lou.

42:51.694 --> 42:54.155
And once you leave town,
I wouldn't even worry about it.

42:55.698 --> 42:58.493
Thanks, thanks a lot, Daddy.
You really came through for me.

43:01.496 --> 43:05.416
- I got some money I could give you.
- No, keep it. Keep it.

43:06.459 --> 43:08.086
Well, now, son...

43:09.003 --> 43:11.589
I want you to know that, er...

43:11.714 --> 43:15.760
I hope everything works out
with you and Alabama.

43:15.885 --> 43:17.845
I like her.

43:18.763 --> 43:22.225
And I think you make
a real cute couple.

43:24.894 --> 43:29.482
Yeah, well, you stay out of trouble.
Hmm?

43:29.607 --> 43:33.778
You got a, er... You got a wife
to think about now.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.447
Quit fucking around.

43:39.367 --> 43:40.785
Son...

43:43.496 --> 43:45.581
I love you.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.967
- All right.
- All right.

43:56.634 --> 44:00.555
This is my friend Dick Ritchie's
number and address in Hollywood,

44:00.680 --> 44:01.800
that's where we're gonna be.

44:01.889 --> 44:04.517
You can get in touch with me
through him. All right.

44:04.767 --> 44:08.187
Come on, Alabama. We're taking off.
Kiss Pops goodbye.

44:11.983 --> 44:15.945
Bye, Daddy.
Hope to see you again soon.

44:17.780 --> 44:21.200
Hey, hey! What kind
of daughterly smackeroo is that?

44:24.954 --> 44:26.998
I'll send you a postcard from Hollywood,
all right?

44:27.123 --> 44:29.542
- Now, Bama... Bama.
- Yes, sir?

44:29.750 --> 44:31.127
Take care of that one for me.

44:31.419 --> 44:33.897
Don't worry, Daddy. I'm gonna keep
this fella on a short leash.

44:33.921 --> 44:37.633
As the sun sets slowly in the west,
we bid you a fine farewell.

44:42.930 --> 44:44.974
Bye, Daddy!

44:45.808 --> 44:49.896
Son of a bitch was right.
She tastes like a peach.

44:50.021 --> 44:52.607
Come on, Rommel.
Come on, boy, come on, come on!

44:52.732 --> 44:55.401
Go on in there. Come on!

45:09.248 --> 45:12.293
- Hello?
- ♪ Hello, baby! ♪

45:12.543 --> 45:14.086
- Clarence?
- You got it!

45:14.337 --> 45:16.964
Clarence, it's great to hear from you.
What's going on?

45:17.256 --> 45:18.883
Well, you are gonna be
seeing me shortly.

45:19.467 --> 45:22.887
- You're coming to LA! When?
- Uh, tomorrow.

45:24.013 --> 45:26.241
There's a story behind all that.
I'll tell you when I see you.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.101
And by the way, I ain't gonna be alone,
I'm bringing my lovely wife.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.896
Get the fuck outta here!
Clarence, you got married?

45:32.146 --> 45:33.606
I'm a married man, buddy.

45:34.649 --> 45:36.752
A married man!
You wanna say "hello" to my better half?

45:36.776 --> 45:39.153
- Come here.
- Hi, Dick. This is Alabama Worley.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.280
Hi, how you doing, Alabama Worley?

45:42.490 --> 45:45.243
Hi. Clarence told me all about you.
He said you were his best friend.

45:45.451 --> 45:47.286
So, I guess that makes you
my best friend too.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.748
- Tell him we gotta go.
- Clarence says we gotta go.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.625
Wait, can I speak to Clarence, please?

45:52.750 --> 45:55.378
- Ask him if he got the letter.
- Did you get the letter?

45:55.586 --> 45:57.672
- What letter?
- What letter?

45:57.922 --> 45:59.562
- The letter I sent.
- The letter he sent.

45:59.674 --> 46:01.968
- I didn't get any letter.
- Has he gotten his mail yet?

46:02.176 --> 46:05.471
- Have you gotten your mail yet?
- Well, no, my roommate Floyd...

46:05.680 --> 46:08.766
- Has he looked through it?
- Have you looked through it?

46:08.891 --> 46:10.309
No.

46:11.352 --> 46:15.856
- Tell him to go look through it.
- Go and look through it.

46:16.315 --> 46:18.276
Wait, wait, wait.
Can I speak to Clarence, please?

46:19.819 --> 46:21.404
He wants to talk to you.

46:21.654 --> 46:24.699
No time. Tell him we gotta go.
Tell him, read the letter.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.075
Read the letter.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.703
Tell him I love him
and tell him as of tomorrow...

46:28.828 --> 46:30.162
Honey, hold this.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.456
- Tell him as of tomorrow...
- As of tomorrow...

46:32.581 --> 46:37.420
al| of your money problems
are gonna be over.

46:37.712 --> 46:39.880
Hello? What money problems?

46:41.048 --> 46:42.174
Bye-bye.

46:44.719 --> 46:47.513
Hello? Hello?

47:00.651 --> 47:03.654
Floyd! Floyd, you used up
the last piece of toilet paper!

47:25.259 --> 47:26.802
Hey! Hey! Rommel!

47:27.386 --> 47:29.638
Hey, come here! Rommel! Rommel!

47:50.868 --> 47:55.122
Frankie, tell Luca to go outside
and do you know what.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.841
Do you know who I am, Mr Worley?

48:07.551 --> 48:09.845
I give up. Who are you?

48:10.930 --> 48:15.226
The Antichrist. You got me
in a vendetta kind of mood.

48:15.351 --> 48:16.644
You tell the angels in heaven

48:16.894 --> 48:18.896
you never seen evil
so singularly personified

48:19.021 --> 48:21.357
as you did in the face
of the man who killed you.

48:22.108 --> 48:25.986
My name is Vincent Coccotti.
I work as counsel for Mr Blue Lou Boyle.

48:26.112 --> 48:27.780
The man your son stole from.

48:29.073 --> 48:32.785
I hear you were once a cop,
so I can assume you've heard of us before.

48:32.910 --> 48:36.205
- Am I correct?
- I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

48:37.498 --> 48:40.668
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up

48:40.793 --> 48:44.547
the "how full of shit am |?" question
you've been asking yourself.

48:45.965 --> 48:47.800
We're gonna have a little Q&A.

48:47.925 --> 48:52.847
And at the risk of sounding redundant,
please make your answers genuine.

48:53.722 --> 48:56.809
- You want a Chesterfield?
- No.

48:58.352 --> 49:01.897
I have a son of my own,
about your boy's age.

49:02.022 --> 49:04.692
I can imagine how painful
this must be for you.

49:04.817 --> 49:08.988
But Clarence
and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his

49:09.113 --> 49:10.353
brought this all on themselves.

49:10.489 --> 49:14.285
I implore you not to go
down that road with them.

49:14.410 --> 49:17.872
You could always take comfort
in the fact you never had a choice.

49:19.623 --> 49:24.128
Look, I'd like to help you if I could,
but I haven't seen Clarence.

49:28.215 --> 49:29.300
You see that?

49:32.094 --> 49:36.474
That smarts, doesn't it?
To get slammed in the nose.

49:36.599 --> 49:39.810
Fucks you all up. You get the pain
shooting through your brain.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.188
Your eyes fill up with water.

49:42.313 --> 49:44.482
That ain't any kind of fun.

49:44.607 --> 49:49.069
But what I have to offer you,
that's as good as it's gonna get.

49:49.653 --> 49:51.864
And it won't ever get that good again.

49:52.531 --> 49:56.494
We talked to your neighbours.
They saw a Cadillac.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.038
Purple Cadillac.

49:59.330 --> 50:03.792
Clarence's purple Cadillac,
parked in front of your trailer yesterday.

50:04.335 --> 50:07.505
Mr Worley... have you seen your son?

50:08.547 --> 50:10.382
I've seen him.

50:10.508 --> 50:14.970
I can't be sure of how much he told you,
so, in the chance you're in the dark

50:15.095 --> 50:17.431
about some of this,
let me shed some light.

50:17.556 --> 50:19.517
That whore your boy hangs around with,

50:19.808 --> 50:22.728
her pimp is an associate of mine.

50:22.853 --> 50:24.647
Along with his pimping and other affairs,

50:24.772 --> 50:28.484
he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently...

50:29.109 --> 50:32.655
that dirty little whore found out
we were gonna do some business,

50:32.780 --> 50:36.992
because your son, the cowboy,
and his flame, came into the room blazing

50:37.117 --> 50:40.621
and didn't stop until they were
pretty sure everybody was dead.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.708
What are you talking about?

50:44.833 --> 50:48.629
I'm talking about a massacre.
They snatched my narcotics.

50:49.296 --> 50:51.966
Hightailed it out of there.
Would have got away with it.

50:52.091 --> 50:55.302
But your son, fuckhead that he is,

50:55.427 --> 50:59.640
left his driver's licence
in the dead guy's hand.

51:02.226 --> 51:05.938
- You know, I don't believe you.
- That's of minor importance.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.942
What is of major fucking importance
is that I believe you.

51:11.694 --> 51:13.779
Where'd they go?

51:13.904 --> 51:15.990
On their honeymoon.

51:21.537 --> 51:24.248
I'm getting angry asking
the same question a second time.

51:24.456 --> 51:26.625
- Where did they go?
- They didn't tell me.

51:26.750 --> 51:29.211
Now, you just wait a minute
and listen to me.

51:29.336 --> 51:31.922
I haven't seen Clarence in three years.

51:32.965 --> 51:37.928
He shows up yesterday with a young girl,
saying that he got married.

51:39.430 --> 51:45.686
He asked for, er... some quick cash
to go on a honeymoon.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.231
He asked me
if he could borrow $500.

51:50.441 --> 51:54.028
I felt like helping him,
so I wrote him out a cheque.

51:54.153 --> 51:56.655
We went to breakfast in the morning.

51:57.990 --> 52:01.035
And that's the last I saw of him.

52:01.160 --> 52:03.120
So help me God.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.665
They never thought to tell me
where they were going.

52:08.626 --> 52:11.086
And I never thought to ask.

52:42.493 --> 52:43.661
You know...

52:45.204 --> 52:48.082
Sicilians are great liars.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.001
The best in the world.

52:53.379 --> 52:54.630
I'm Sicilian.

52:54.755 --> 53:00.177
My father was the world heavyweight
champion of Sicilian liars.

53:00.302 --> 53:03.597
From growing up with him,
I learned the pantomime.

53:03.889 --> 53:06.600
There are 17 different things
a guy can do when he lies

53:06.725 --> 53:10.062
to give himself away,
a guy's got 17 pantomimes.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.690
Woman's got 20. Guy has got 17.

53:13.273 --> 53:15.984
If you know them,
like you know your own face,

53:16.110 --> 53:18.946
they'd beat lie detectors all to hell.

53:19.154 --> 53:21.824
What we got here is a little game
of show-and-tell.

53:21.949 --> 53:24.669
And you don't wanna show me nothing
but you're telling me everything.

53:26.203 --> 53:30.457
I know you know where they are,
so tell me,

53:30.666 --> 53:33.961
before I do some damage
you won't walk away from.

53:36.922 --> 53:40.050
Could I have one of those
Chesterfields now?

53:42.302 --> 53:43.470
Sure.

53:49.101 --> 53:54.898
You got a match? No, wait.
No, no, don't bother, I got one.

54:05.159 --> 54:09.163
- You're Sicilian, huh?
- Yeah, Sicilian.

54:13.208 --> 54:14.710
You know...

54:16.545 --> 54:18.505
| read a lot.

54:18.630 --> 54:21.508
Especially things about history.

54:22.968 --> 54:25.387
I find that shit fascinating.

54:27.055 --> 54:29.933
Here's a fact I don't know
whether you know or not.

54:33.854 --> 54:37.816
Sicilians were spawned by niggers.

54:45.073 --> 54:46.533
Come again?

54:48.160 --> 54:50.245
It's a fact. Yeah.

54:50.370 --> 54:56.418
You see... Sicilians have black blood
pumping through their hearts.

54:57.961 --> 55:01.256
And if you don't believe me,
you can look it up.

55:01.381 --> 55:04.635
Hundreds and hundreds of years ago,
you see,

55:04.885 --> 55:09.431
the Moors conquered Sicily,
and the Moors are niggers.

55:09.848 --> 55:13.227
- Yes.
- So you see, way back then,

55:13.477 --> 55:17.022
Sicilians were like wops
from northern Italy.

55:17.147 --> 55:21.193
They all had blond hair and blue eyes.
But, well...

55:22.986 --> 55:26.031
Then the Moors moved in there

55:26.156 --> 55:29.034
and well, they changed
the whole country.

55:29.159 --> 55:34.122
They did so much fucking
with Sicilian women, huh,

55:34.248 --> 55:37.125
that they changed
the whole blood line forever.

55:37.251 --> 55:40.921
That is why blond hair and blue eyes

55:41.046 --> 55:44.758
became black hair and dark skin.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.804
You know,
it's absolutely amazing to me...

55:50.722 --> 55:55.310
to think that to this day,
hundreds of years later, that...

55:56.520 --> 56:01.775
that Sicilians still carry
that nigger gene.

56:03.193 --> 56:04.820
Now, this...

56:04.945 --> 56:08.156
No, I'm quoting history.

56:08.991 --> 56:12.286
It's written, it's a fact. It's written.

56:12.411 --> 56:14.288
I love this guy.

56:19.835 --> 56:22.087
Your ancestors are niggers.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.007
Hey!

56:27.593 --> 56:33.015
And your great, great, great,
great-grandmother fucked a nigger.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.061
Yeah.
And she had a half-nigger kid.

56:38.186 --> 56:43.066
Now... if that's a fact, tell me:

56:44.151 --> 56:45.777
Am I lying?

56:49.239 --> 56:50.741
Cos you...

56:53.201 --> 56:55.078
You're part eggplant.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.172
Hey, hey, hey!

57:06.298 --> 57:08.133
You're a cantaloupe.

57:18.352 --> 57:20.562
That was beautiful.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.278
Let me see that.

57:42.209 --> 57:43.794
I haven't killed anybody...

57:45.045 --> 57:46.546
since 1984.

57:50.008 --> 57:51.885
Go to this comedian's son's apartment.

57:53.095 --> 57:57.099
Come back with something
that tells me where that asshole went.

57:57.224 --> 57:59.893
So I can wipe this egg off my face.

58:13.073 --> 58:15.993
Fix this fucked-up family for good.

58:21.289 --> 58:23.583
Hey, boss.

58:23.709 --> 58:25.794
Get ready to be happy.

58:27.295 --> 58:31.550
'Morning, everybody. It's 6:22
here in LA. I'm David Perry at KBLU.'

58:47.274 --> 58:51.278
Hello? Hi.

58:55.240 --> 58:56.533
Morning!

58:56.658 --> 58:57.993
Floyd!

58:59.828 --> 59:03.707
Floyd, can't you answer the door,
at least, for me?

59:03.832 --> 59:06.501
Oh, man, I didn't even hear it.

59:06.626 --> 59:07.669
Hello?

59:07.794 --> 59:09.629
You can't help me out
every now and then?

59:09.755 --> 59:11.548
Yes.

59:14.301 --> 59:16.678
- Did you call for a date?
- Huh?

59:16.887 --> 59:19.639
I knew it was you!

59:19.765 --> 59:21.808
How you doing, man?

59:21.933 --> 59:23.327
Dick, this is Alabama.
Alabama, this is Dick.

59:23.351 --> 59:27.272
- Nice to meet you!
- Hi, I'm Alabama.

59:27.481 --> 59:29.876
- Clarence, you look good!
- This is a great place, this is nice.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.736
Come on, I'm starving. Let's go get
something to eat. Who's this?

59:32.944 --> 59:35.739
- This is Floyd.
- Floyd, all right. Come on!

59:35.864 --> 59:38.325
Hey, Floyd.
Watch yourself. Be careful.

59:39.493 --> 59:40.786
Hey-

59:54.508 --> 59:56.259
Hey, hey. I didn't tell you guys yet?

59:56.384 --> 59:59.930
I had this really, really good audition
for "TJ Hooker" the other day.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:04.101
<i>- You're gomg to be on “TA Hooker“?
- Yeah, 'We the new “TA Hooker“.</i>

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:06.770
- Knock on wood.
- You get to meet Captain Kirk?

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:08.939
Well, you don't get to meet him
in the audition,

01:00:09.064 --> 01:00:11.149
but if I get the part, hope, hope...

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.277
- That would be amazing.
- It would be cool.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.446
Meeting Captain Kirk,
that would be cool.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.209
Here we are.

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:32.963
The honeymoon suite.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:37.759
You're really in love, aren't you?

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:41.096
For the very first time in my life.
Know what that's like?

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:42.638
No.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:46.893
- Nah.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.937
What are you doing in LA anyway, huh?

01:00:54.943 --> 01:00:59.573
Holy Mary, mother of God.
This shit can't be real.

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.992
- It'll get you high.
- What?

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.996
- I said, it'll get you high.
- Hey, we got cable.

01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:11.293
- You want some wine, sweetheart?
- Just a little bit, Not much of a wine gal.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:14.254
That is fucking real.

01:01:14.379 --> 01:01:17.382
- This is fucking real, Clarence.
- I certainly hope so.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:20.635
You've got a hell of a lot
of cocaine here, man.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.803
I know.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.055
Do you realise how much
fucking coke you have here?

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:26.057
No, tell me.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:28.310
I don't know, but it's a fucking lot!

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.105
This is Drex|'s coke?

01:01:32.355 --> 01:01:34.649
No, Drex|'s dead, you see.
It's Clarence's coke.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.902
And Clarence, he can do
whatever he wants with it.

01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.862
What Clarence wants to do
is to sell it.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:42.407
Then me and Bama'|| jump on a jet plane
and spend the rest of our lives spending.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:44.701
So you got my letter?
You lined up buyers for me?

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:47.204
Listen, Clarence,
I'm not Joe Cocaine, OK?

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.331
You're an actor,
I hear these Hollywood guys

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:51.166
get it delivered to the set
all the time.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:53.668
Well, they do. All right? They do.

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:55.938
And maybe one day,
when I start being a successful actor,

01:01:55.962 --> 01:02:00.383
I'll be like one of those guys, but until
that day, I ain't got nothing. All right?

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:03.094
I don't have a pot to piss in,
or a window to throw it out.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.971
All I got is fucking Floyd.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:08.225
If you want me to help you sell a
little bit at a time, that's all I can do.

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.435
No, no, no.
None of that little-bit-at-a-time shit.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.372
It's gotta be the whole enchilada
in one shot, that's the way it's gotta be.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.316
Clarence, do you have any idea
how difficult that's gonna be?

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:17.943
What the fuck you are talking about?

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:20.588
I'm offering half-a-million dollars
worth of white for 200 grand.

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:22.948
- You're telling me that's difficult?
- Very difficult!

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:25.617
That's very difficult,
do you understand? Listen to me.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.970
It's difficult because you're selling
to a particular group,

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:29.663
you understand what I'm talking about?

01:02:29.788 --> 01:02:33.124
Fat cats, big shots.
Guys who can afford $200,000.

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.531
Guys who can use a whole
fucking suitcase full of cocaine.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.671
Basically, Clarence, guys I don't know.

01:02:37.879 --> 01:02:41.716
And guys you don't know.
And more importantly, they don't know you.

01:02:46.012 --> 01:02:47.430
Come on, Dick.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.981
OK, Clarence. Listen.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.193
There's one guy that I know
that could help you out, Clarence,

01:03:00.318 --> 01:03:04.155
but I'm not guaranteeing you anything.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:09.953
- Is he big-league?
- No. He's not big-league. OK?

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:15.125
But he works as an assistant to a very
big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:20.880
Lee Donowitz could afford and can use
$200,000 worth of coke.

01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:23.091
Being that's what you have.

01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:25.719
All right, so what did you tell him?

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:28.179
What the fuck do you expect me
to tell him, huh?

01:03:28.346 --> 01:03:30.765
I mean, I didn't know what
was bullshit and what wasn't.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:35.061
And besides, Floyd smoked
the second page of the letter. OK?

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:38.732
- What's this acting-class guy's name?
- Elliot.

01:03:39.774 --> 01:03:41.151
Elliot what?

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:43.153
Elliot Blitzer.

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.489
OK. We'll get him on the phone
and we'll arrange a meeting

01:03:46.614 --> 01:03:50.577
so we can get through all this
getting-to-know-you stuff, all right?

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:53.788
- Where?
- Where should we meet?

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:59.836
- Roller-coaster.
- Roller-coasters.

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:10.096
So, you got $500,000 worth of cola
that you are unloading for $200,000..

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.432
You want an animal cracker?

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:13.892
Um, thanks.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:19.022
- Wait, save the gorillas.
- Gorillas...

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.067
I won't. Thanks.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:26.821
So, you got...
$500,000 worth of cola

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.240
that you're unloading for $200,000.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.744
"Unloading." That's a hell of a way
to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:36.706
- Where did you get it?
- Where did I get it?

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:41.002
I grow it on my windowsill.
See, the light's really good up there.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:45.632
I'm up high enough off the street,
so you can't see it. It works perfectly.

01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:46.758
Yeah.

01:04:48.593 --> 01:04:50.345
Where...?
Really, where does it come from?

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.806
- Where's it come from?
- Yeah.

01:04:52.931 --> 01:04:55.225
- Coca leaves.
- You're sick. I'm out of here.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.937
- Elliot, chill out, chill out.
- Come on, sit down here. All right?

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.165
We're both here, we might
as well enjoy the ride. All right?

01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:03.900
I'll tell you. OK? But you gotta
promise me you'll keep it quiet.

01:05:04.025 --> 01:05:05.503
If Dick hadn't ensured me
you're good people,

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.129
I'd just tell you,
none of your fucking business.

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.364
- OK, OK.
- This is gonna be fun.

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.659
Let's go!

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:16.246
The truth of the matter is this:
I got a friend in the department.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:17.872
- What department?
- What department?

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:20.166
What do you think, eight ball?

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:22.460
The police department?

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:25.338
Give the man a prize! All right, now,
about a year and a half ago,

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.757
this friend of mine got access
to the evidence room.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.635
And he snagged this coke,
but he's a good cop with a wife and a kid.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.431
So he held on to it for about a year
until he found a guy he could trust.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:36.724
- And he trusts you?
- Yeah, he trusts me.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.370
We were in 4-H together.
We've known each other since childhood.

01:05:39.561 --> 01:05:41.580
I'm handling the sales part,
he's my silent partner,

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:44.065
and he knows, if I get fucked up,
I won't drop dime on him.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:46.317
OK?
Now, no further, you understand.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.671
All right, he's kind of paranoid,
I didn't tell you nothing.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:51.197
- You didn't hear nothing.
- I didn't hear nothing!

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.992
All right! Here we go!

01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:00.457
Ride it out, baby!

01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.260
Yeah!

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:17.182
We're going in for another one!
Hang on, Elliot! Whoo!

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:34.866
Oh, yeah, we got this puppy.
This was a good idea.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.458
Elliot looks a little green.

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:52.217
Elliot, do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.802
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

01:06:55.762 --> 01:06:56.930
What?

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:00.141
I said, do I look like a beautiful blond
with big tits and an ass

01:07:00.266 --> 01:07:02.519
that tastes like French-vanilla ice cream?

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:03.895
No.

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:06.356
No. OK, then why are you
telling me all this bullshit, huh?

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:10.026
- What, do you wanna fuck me?
- Clarence. He's sick, man.

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.778
Let me handle this, all right?

01:07:11.903 --> 01:07:18.660
You know what? Just get it straight.
Lee is not into taking risks, OK?

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:23.122
He's got a couple of guys,
he's been dealing with them for years.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:26.459
They're reliable,
they're dependable, and they're safe.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.379
Riddle me this, Batman.

01:07:29.504 --> 01:07:32.066
If you're all so much in love with
each other, what are you doing here?

01:07:32.090 --> 01:07:34.193
I'm sure you've got better things
to do with your time

01:07:34.217 --> 01:07:36.970
than hang around upside-down
on a roller-coaster all day.

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:40.848
Your guy is interested because
with that much shit at his fingertips

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:43.726
he could play Joe-fucking-Hollywood
till the wheels come off.

01:07:43.851 --> 01:07:45.603
He can sell it, he can snort it,

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.106
he can play Santa Claus with it,
as far as I'm concerned.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:51.109
At the price he's paying,
he can afford to just throw it around.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.154
He's gonna be everybody's best friend,
all right?

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:55.238
I'm not putting him down, here.

01:07:55.363 --> 01:07:57.341
It's his money, let him do
whatever the hell he wants.

01:07:57.365 --> 01:07:59.605
But don't expect me and my friends
to hang around forever

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.619
waiting for you guys
to grow some guts, all right?

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:03.413
Oh, Jesus!

01:08:06.583 --> 01:08:08.918
- Yeah, hello?
- Hi, Lee.

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:13.131
Elliot, it's Sunday. Can you tell me
why I'm talking to you on Sunday?

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.901
I don't see enough of you all week,
I gotta talk to you on Sunday, too?

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:19.595
I-I-I'm with that party that
you wanted me to get together with, Lee.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.432
- You know who I'm talking about?
- I don't believe this, Elliot.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.643
Why the hell are you talking to me
on my phone about that?

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:30.982
Well, because I'm standing with the guy,
and he insists on talking to you.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.234
What, are you out of your fucking mind?

01:08:35.862 --> 01:08:39.407
He said that if I didn't get you on the
phone, that he wouldn't wanna do...

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:42.368
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence.
At last, we speak.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.139
Now, first of all, Lee, I wanna tell you
I'm a real big fan of yours.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:47.624
That's why I wanna open
"Dr Zhivago" in LA.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.749
And I need you and your abilities
to distribute it.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:52.170
Uh, Clarence, uh...

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.466
I dunno, Clarence. "Dr Zhivago"
is a pretty big movie, you know.

01:08:56.674 --> 01:08:58.444
The biggest. The biggest movie
you've ever dealt with, Lee.

01:08:58.468 --> 01:08:59.969
We're talking a lot of film, here.

01:09:00.094 --> 01:09:04.307
A man would have to be an idiot not to be
a little cautious about a movie like that.

01:09:04.432 --> 01:09:06.350
And, Lee, you are no idiot.

01:09:06.559 --> 01:09:08.853
No, no, no. I'm not saying
I'm not interested, Clarence.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.165
It's just that being a distributor
is not what I'm all about.

01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:12.429
I'm a movie producer, you know?

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:15.276
I'm on this earth to make
good movies, nothing more...

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:17.194
and nothing, well,
maybe less sometimes.

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:21.198
Hey! Choose a fucking lane!

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:24.911
No, not you, just some idiot who...
Don't give me the finger!

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:26.412
I'll fucking have you killed!

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:31.084
'So, bottom line is I'm not Paramount.
You know what I'm saying?'

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:33.044
I got a select few distributors
I deal with.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.130
I buy their little movies and I accomplish
what I wanna accomplish,

01:09:36.255 --> 01:09:38.734
and get the fuck outta there,
very business-like and very easy,

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.301
and very little risk, Clarence.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:41.928
Lee, we're talking "Dr Zhivago".

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.096
This'|| be packing them in
for a year and a half.

01:09:44.221 --> 01:09:47.850
Two years you're not gonna have to deal
with anybody else's movie but mine.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:51.104
Nobody's but yours?
Well, what's the rush here?

01:09:51.312 --> 01:09:54.189
I just want to be able to announce
this deal at Cannes, all right?

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:56.075
If I had time for a courtship,
Lee, I would.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:58.953
I'd take you out, I'd hold your hand,
I'd kiss your cheek at the door.

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.489
But I'm not in that position,
I need to know right now

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.866
if you and I are in bed together or not.

01:10:03.991 --> 01:10:06.178
If you want my movie, Lee,
you're gonna have to come to terms

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:07.537
with your fear and desire.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:11.165
Uh-huh...
Fear and desire, huh, Clarence?

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:16.546
'Don't you know that my films have
grossed more than 2.8 billion, Clarence?

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:17.714
'Let me talk to Elliot.'

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.466
- You wanna talk to Elliot?
- 'Let me talk to Elliot.'

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:23.344
Elliot. He wants to talk to you.

01:10:25.513 --> 01:10:28.683
- Hi, Lee.
- Elliot, where do you know this guy from?

01:10:28.933 --> 01:10:31.602
He's a friend of Dick's, remember?

01:10:31.728 --> 01:10:33.855
'Who the fuck is Dick?'

01:10:36.983 --> 01:10:40.987
- You want me to suck his dick?
- 'No. Who the fuck is Dick?'

01:10:41.112 --> 01:10:44.490
Oh, who the fuck is Dick?
Dick is my friend.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.775
- He's in my acting class.
- You told him I'm an actor?

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:51.122
Is he any good?
Is he talented? Really?

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:55.793
- How does Dick know this guy?
- They grew up together.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:59.464
OK, er... Wednesday at the hotel.
Three o'clock.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.189
Bring the whole fucking cast, all right?

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:05.136
Elliot, don't call me here anymore,
especially not on Sunday, all right?

01:11:06.137 --> 01:11:09.599
- What did he say?
- OK, hold on... Shut up for a second!

01:11:09.724 --> 01:11:12.351
Hey, you guys.
This is what's gonna happen.

01:11:12.477 --> 01:11:16.314
Three o'clock, Beverly Ambassador,
he wants to see everybody. OK?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:20.067
And he'll talk to you.
If after talking to you he likes you,

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:21.986
wants to deal with you,
he'll deal with you.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:25.406
If he doesn't, he'll say, "Fuck you,"
and he'll walk out of the room.

01:11:25.531 --> 01:11:28.034
- Did you tell him I was...?
- Shut up for a second.

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.994
And he wants a sample bag.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.121
- No problem on all counts.
- Great.

01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:34.832
Did you tell him I was an actor?

01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:36.167
Yes, I told him.

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:39.045
- You told him I was good?
- Yeah, I lied.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.271
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:58.564
Oh, pretty good.

01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:00.775
- You Dick? Dick Ritchie?
- No.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.902
No, he's not here right now.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:07.365
- You live here?
- Yes, I do.

01:12:07.907 --> 01:12:10.743
You're sort of roommates?

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.912
Exactly roommates.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.748
Maybe you can help me,
I'm looking for a friend of mine.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.500
Clarence Worley from Detroit?

01:12:17.625 --> 01:12:19.436
He's traveling with a real pretty girl
named Alabama.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:21.963
Oh, yeah, man, I know 'em.
They've been by here.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:23.214
- You've seen them?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.967
- They staying here?
- No, they're staying at the...

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:31.013
Safari Motor... Motel Inn.
Safari Motel.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.766
- Safari Motel?
- Yeah.

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.521
How do you know that?
I mean, have you been over there?

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:44.443
No, they were here, and they said
they were going to go there.

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:46.237
Then they went.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.156
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Safari Motel.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:50.533
- Safari Motel.
- Uh-huh.

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:53.786
Hey, you want to watch some TV
or something? They might be back here.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.454
No, no, thank you.
Thank you, though.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:56.914
OK.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:13:00.960
- You take care, I might be back.
- Yeah, man. OK, be cool.

01:13:05.298 --> 01:13:09.802
Don't condescend me, man.
I'll fucking kill you, man.

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:18.978
I'm so proud of you.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.480
- Did I do my part OK?
- Bamalou, you were perfect.

01:13:21.689 --> 01:13:23.274
- Like a ninja?
- Like a ninja.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.444
I'm gonna go grab us
something to eat, all right?

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:30.531
I'm gonna go jump in the tub and
get all wet and slippery and soapy.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.784
And hop onto that waterbed
and watch X-rated movies

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.329
until you get your ass
back into my loving arms.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:40.958
Hurry back now.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:51.302
We now return to "Bullitt"
already in progress.

01:14:03.064 --> 01:14:04.649
Hi.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.692
Hi!

01:14:17.161 --> 01:14:19.288
- Cigarette?
- No.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:26.295
That's a very nice outfit.

01:14:28.339 --> 01:14:33.594
This?
I got this in Las Vegas, Nevada.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:48.317
Alabama, where's our coke?
And where's Clarence?

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:50.903
When's he coming back?

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:55.324
I'm sorry, I think you have
the wrong room. My name is Sadie.

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:01.163
We don't have any Coke, but there's
a Pepsi machine down the hall.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.724
I don't know anybody named Clarence,
but perhaps my husband does.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:08.504
You can ask him cos he'll be home
in a minute. He plays football.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.634
He's just at practice.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.855
- Give me your hand.
- OK.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.072
You are unbelievably cute.

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:37.575
Thank you. Thanks.

01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:42.329
Let me see those eyes.

01:15:44.498 --> 01:15:46.751
What a face.

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:52.423
- Do me a favour. Turn around for me.
- OK.

01:15:53.424 --> 01:15:55.801
No, go the other way.

01:15:55.926 --> 01:15:57.470
OK.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:17.156
- Ooh. That hurts, don't it?
- Uh-huh.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:20.785
Get on your feet, sweetie.
You ain't hurt that bad.

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.831
Now, where's our coke?
Where's Clarence?

01:16:25.956 --> 01:16:28.375
And when's he coming back?

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.377
OK, OK.

01:16:34.173 --> 01:16:36.258
Fuck you.

01:16:37.218 --> 01:16:38.636
Fuck me?

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:47.812
What's the matter, baby, huh?

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.439
Can't breathe?

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.821
You better get used to that.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:01.450
- Hi.
- Smells like hamburgers in here.

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.286
Tell me, what is the biggest,
fattest hamburger you guys got?

01:17:04.495 --> 01:17:06.455
That would be Steve's
Double Chili Cheeseburger.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.791
- Well, give me two of 'em bad boys.
- Uh-huh.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:12.795
Two chili fries.
And two large diet cokes.

01:17:13.087 --> 01:17:14.213
Anything else?

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:20.469
Come here. Look at yourself! Look!
Take a good look.

01:17:20.761 --> 01:17:22.489
You think your boyfriend
would go through this shit?

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:24.849
If you do, you're fucking stupid.
You know that?

01:17:25.599 --> 01:17:29.037
You're a very pretty girl, Alabama, but you
ain't going to be very pretty for very long.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:34.275
I'm gonna ask you a fucking question,
and you give me the right fucking answer!

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.653
Now... where's my coke?

01:17:44.118 --> 01:17:46.036
Turn around. Turn around!

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.039
Answer me!

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.337
Come on.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:02.219
You got a lot of heart, kid.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:09.185
Now, that is a great issue.
You gotten to the story on Elvis yet?

01:18:10.853 --> 01:18:13.314
No. I hadn't.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.284
That's probably the single best piece
I've ever read on Elvis Presley

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.485
in my entire life, look at this.

01:18:19.028 --> 01:18:23.908
Look. See, it tries to pin down what
the attraction is after all these years.

01:18:24.033 --> 01:18:26.660
It covers the whole spectrum,
talks to the fans,

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.121
people who grew up with him,
people who love his music.

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.665
Then, there's the fanatics. Right?

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.498
I don't know about you,
but they give me the creeps.

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:39.298
- Yeah, yeah, I see what you mean.
- I mean, look at her.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:43.093
It looks like she fell off the ugly tree
and hit every branch on the way down.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.605
Now, the first time you kill somebody,
that's the hardest.

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:59.693
I don't give a shit if you're fucking
Wyatt Earp or Jack the Ripper.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:09.703
Remember that guy in Texas? The guy up in
that fucking tower, killed all them people?

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.750
I bet you green money that first
little black dot he took a bead on

01:19:14.875 --> 01:19:17.253
that was the bitch of the bunch.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.340
First one is tough, no fucking fooling.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.987
The second one ain't no fucking Mardi Gras
either but it's better than the first one,

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:30.182
cos you still feel the same thing,
you know, except it's more diluted.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.351
You know, it's better.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.194
I threw up on the first one,
you believe that?

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.400
Then the third one.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:42.069
The third one is easy,
you level right off.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:48.033
That's no problem. Now... shit.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:52.871
Now I do it just to watch
their fucking expression change.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:04.174
I don't fucking believe it.

01:20:05.676 --> 01:20:07.845
Did you put it under the bed?

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.388
Uh-huh.

01:20:12.391 --> 01:20:14.685
I can't believe it.
You put it under the fucking bed?

01:20:14.810 --> 01:20:16.979
I didn't look under the fucking bed.

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.654
I can't believe you put it
under the fucking bed.

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:25.880
And I can't believe I didn't look
under the fucking bed.

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:27.948
I'm getting fucking old!

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:32.661
Ha-ha! Journey's end, baby.
Snow at the end of the rainbow.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.791
One less thing
I gotta fucking worry about.

01:20:48.469 --> 01:20:52.348
This is it, baby.
Moment of truth.

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.277
You got a lot of heart, kid,
you know that?

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:11.408
You wanna play?
Huh? Is that what you want?

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:15.287
You want to play with Daddy?
Come on.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.932
Come on, I'll give you one shot
because I like you.

01:21:17.956 --> 01:21:20.709
Stick it in me, baby.
Come on, stick it in Daddy.

01:21:21.835 --> 01:21:24.838
Stick it in me. Go ahead.

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:26.882
Come on, come on! Come on!

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:29.426
Oh, fuck!

01:21:33.847 --> 01:21:35.182
Ah! Motherfucker!

01:21:47.903 --> 01:21:50.739
All right...
no more Mr Fucking-Nice-Guy.

01:21:50.864 --> 01:21:52.366
Oh, God!

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.251
What do you think of that? Ha-ha!

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:04.771
What do you think about that, baby?
What do you think about that?

01:22:04.795 --> 01:22:07.714
- Wait! Wait!
- What?

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:13.178
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- You look ridiculous!

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:20.394
I look fucking ridiculous?
Get up! Laugh it up!

01:22:20.519 --> 01:22:22.062
Come on, laugh it up!

01:22:22.521 --> 01:22:24.523
You were in hysterics a minute ago,
so laugh!

01:22:24.648 --> 01:22:26.984
- You like that, don't you?
- Fuck you!

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:30.446
Shit! Fucking cunt!

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:34.343
Fuck! Motherfucker!
Bama, we gotta go! Jesus Christ!

01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:37.262
Come on, darling.
We gotta get the fuck out of here!

01:23:37.387 --> 01:23:39.515
Come on.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.440
The cops are gonna be here
any fucking second!

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:46.897
Fuck! Fuck! Come on. Fuck.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:50.275
I'm sorry. Fuck.

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:03.914
Fuck! Fuck!

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:08.335
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:11.255
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:24:21.848 --> 01:24:24.226
Oh, fuck!

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:26.562
- Fuck!
- Ow! What?

01:24:26.687 --> 01:24:30.524
I don't fucking believe this!
Goddamn it! I knew it! I fucking knew it!

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.456
Oh, fuck, I should have my goddamn
head examined for driving like this.

01:24:46.665 --> 01:24:49.001
Look, Carla... Kandi...

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.753
- Kandi, you gotta help me.
- What can I do?

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:54.881
- Take this. Take this. Hold this.
- What are you? High? No.

01:24:55.090 --> 01:24:58.069
- Fucking put this in your purse.
- I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

01:24:58.093 --> 01:25:01.281
He's not going to search you, you didn't
do anything. Now just put it in your bra!

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:03.765
- I'm not wearing one.
- Please, please, he's almost here!

01:25:03.890 --> 01:25:07.853
- Just fucking put it in your pants!
- No.

01:25:08.395 --> 01:25:12.899
- You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
- Read my lips. No!

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.643
- Asshole.
- After all I did for you, you fucking whore!

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:18.614
Who the fuck do you think you...?

01:25:24.786 --> 01:25:25.871
Hi.

01:25:26.913 --> 01:25:30.125
Hey, look, dickhead. It's your bad luck
that we caught you speeding.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:33.337
And it's your bad luck that
you had a bag of uncut cocaine.

01:25:33.462 --> 01:25:35.797
- Not a tiny little vial.
- A fucking baggy.

01:25:35.922 --> 01:25:37.424
Hey, you got caught.

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:40.153
It's all fun and fucking games,
till you get caught, but now we got you.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:42.929
OK, Mr Elliot fucking actor,
you just made the big time.

01:25:43.055 --> 01:25:45.349
- You're no longer an extra.
- Or a bit player.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:48.894
- Or a supporting actor.
- You're a fucking star. A fucking star!

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:53.315
And you'll be playing your one-man show
nightly for the next two fucking years!

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.900
For a captive audience.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.879
Listen to this. You'll get out in a
few years, you'll meet some old lady.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:26:00.739
You'll get married and you'll be
so understanding to your wife's needs,

01:26:00.864 --> 01:26:02.949
because you'll know
what it feels like to be a woman.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:05.261
Of course you'll only wanna fuck her
in the ass

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:07.221
cos that pussy won't be tight enough
for you anymore.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:10.707
Good point, Detective.
Right? Fucking faggot!

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:15.379
Krinkle, this is it, and it's all ours.
I mean, talk about falling into something.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:18.131
Would the both of you idiots shut up?
I can't understand shit.

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:20.526
Now, what happened, what's going on?
What are you talking about?

01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.843
OK, all right.

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:25.722
Patrol car pulls a guy over for speeding,
right? Suspect's covered with coke.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.201
So they bring the suspect to me and
Nicholson, and we go to work on him.

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:30.268
Nicholson and I.

01:26:30.394 --> 01:26:33.563
Nicholson, what's the fucking difference?
So, we go to work on the guy, right?

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:36.525
We know something's rotten in Denmark,
cos this guy's fucking stupid,

01:26:36.650 --> 01:26:39.778
and he's got a big bag of coke
and it's uncut.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:42.155
And you ain't gonna fucking believe
what he's got to say.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:44.908
Seems a cop from some department,
we don't know which one,

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.869
he stole half a million dollars of coke
from the property cage.

01:26:48.078 --> 01:26:50.118
He'd been sitting on the shit
for a year and a half.

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:51.727
OK, now, the cop's got this weirdo...

01:26:51.832 --> 01:26:53.667
- Suspect's words.
- Who's a front for him.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:57.212
So, our guy, Elliot Blitzer, he's making
a deal between them and his boss,

01:26:57.421 --> 01:27:00.632
big-time fucking movie producer
named Lee Donowitz.

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:02.926
He did that movie,
"Coming Home in a Body Bag".

01:27:03.051 --> 01:27:04.302
The Vietnam movie?

01:27:04.428 --> 01:27:06.012
- Yeah.
- Good fucking movie.

01:27:06.138 --> 01:27:08.306
Fucking A. Great fucking movie.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:11.101
- So, do you believe him?
- I believe he believes him.

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:13.145
This guy's too fucking rattled to be lying.

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.940
He'd roll over on his mommy, his daddy,
his granny and the fucking king of Siam

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.225
- if he had any on him.
- I mean, this guy was a sissy.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:22.904
I mean, he really was, this rabbit
will do anything not to do any time.

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:25.657
You know what he'll do?
He'll wear a wire.

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:28.952
- He'll wear a wire?
- He'll wear a wire, we talked to him.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:33.999
Dirty cops... Well, we got
to get Internal Affairs on this.

01:27:34.124 --> 01:27:37.061
I don't give a shit who you bring in. Bring
in the state militia, the LA Thunderbirds,

01:27:37.085 --> 01:27:40.338
the ghost of Steve fucking McQueen,
ten fucking Roman gladiators!

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:43.467
I don't give a shit, as long as me
and Todd get credit for the bust.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:46.011
Hey, listen, we found him.
We just want the fucking collar.

01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:47.929
That's it. End of story.

01:27:49.264 --> 01:27:51.683
- You got it.
- Fucking A.

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.024
Did I ever tell you
how much I hate airports?

01:27:59.149 --> 01:28:00.609
Uh-uh.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:04.988
See, I used to live by one
back in Dearborn, you know.

01:28:05.113 --> 01:28:08.742
Really frustrating living next
to an airport when you ain't got shit.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.285
Ah...

01:28:12.204 --> 01:28:15.999
And all day long I'm seeing
and hearing people doing exactly

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:18.084
what I want to be doing, but couldn't.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:19.753
What?

01:28:19.878 --> 01:28:26.259
Starting new lives, leaving Detroit,
vacations, business trips...

01:28:27.219 --> 01:28:30.180
- Fun, fun, fun. You all right?
- Mm-hm.

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:37.062
But you and me, we can jump
on any one of those planes out there

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:39.981
and go anywhere we want.
Gives me a whole new outlook.

01:28:40.106 --> 01:28:41.608
I love airports now.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:44.402
Yeah, you ain't kidding.
We got lots to start over.

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:47.072
We should go somewhere
where we can start from scratch.

01:28:48.365 --> 01:28:50.784
I've been in America all my life.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:53.346
I've always wanted to see
what TV in other countries looks like.

01:28:53.370 --> 01:28:55.914
Where do you think we should go,
my little turtle dove?

01:28:58.583 --> 01:28:59.960
Cancun.

01:29:00.836 --> 01:29:02.838
Cancun? Why Cancun?

01:29:02.963 --> 01:29:06.633
It's got a nice ring to it.
It sounds like a movie.

01:29:06.758 --> 01:29:09.886
"Clarence and Alabama
Go To Cancun", don't you think?

01:29:11.346 --> 01:29:14.182
In my movie, darling,
you get top billing.

01:29:15.725 --> 01:29:20.730
Don't worry about nothing, all right?
It's all gonna work out for us.

01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:23.483
We deserve it.

01:29:35.537 --> 01:29:38.137
Now, Floyd, you sure that's how
you get to the Beverly Ambassador?

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:41.209
Yeah, man, I'm positive.

01:29:41.334 --> 01:29:44.379
Yeah, well, let me just tell you,
if we get lost, that's your ass.

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:47.883
And, Floyd, why don't you get
out of my beer and get a fucking job?

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:50.027
- Clarence, can we go?
- We're out the door. We're gone.

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:52.071
We'll meet Elliot in the lobby.
I don't wanna be late.

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.806
Here I go.

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:58.602
Yes?

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:01.354
- I'm out, Floyd.
- Are you here? No, he's not here.

01:30:01.563 --> 01:30:03.356
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Come on, Dick!

01:30:03.481 --> 01:30:05.609
Just let me hear who it is.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:07.068
- Hello?
- Fuck.

01:30:07.319 --> 01:30:09.487
Hey. Hi, Catherine,
I was just walking out...

01:30:09.696 --> 01:30:11.114
What?

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:14.326
Serious?

01:30:15.201 --> 01:30:17.996
- She said that?
- What did she say? Come on, Dick.

01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:22.751
Yo, Catherine,
thank you, thank you.

01:30:22.876 --> 01:30:25.670
I'm gonna talk to you tomorrow.
All right.

01:30:27.464 --> 01:30:29.925
Come on, we gotta go.

01:30:31.635 --> 01:30:33.720
- I got the part.
- Wow!

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.013
I got the part!

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:37.724
That's perfect. That's great.
That's wonderful.

01:30:37.849 --> 01:30:39.893
Didn't even want a call-back.

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:44.856
That's so cool, way to go!

01:30:45.565 --> 01:30:47.776
- I got a seven o'clock call.
- That's great.

01:30:47.901 --> 01:30:51.363
All right, come on, let's go.
I wanna hear all about it, OK? Come on.

01:30:51.488 --> 01:30:54.199
- Hey, Clarence!
- What?

01:30:57.577 --> 01:31:01.623
- Nothing. Forget it.
- All right, come on.

01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:06.503
Hey, get some beer!

01:31:07.253 --> 01:31:08.672
And some...

01:31:09.839 --> 01:31:11.883
And some cleaning products!

01:31:23.061 --> 01:31:25.105
I'm losing a fucking fortune over here.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:35.198
You talking to me,
you fucking wop, you?

01:31:56.886 --> 01:32:00.181
- OK, put your jacket on.
- Put your jacket on.

01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.100
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:32:02.225 --> 01:32:05.020
Put your jacket on.
One sleeve at a time.

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:08.273
It's a big game, now, Elliot.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.860
- It's OK, come on. You all right?
- No.

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:16.114
Elliot, look at me. Look at me.
You comfortable?

01:32:17.323 --> 01:32:22.620
Am I comfortable?
I've got a, like a brick in my scrotum.

01:32:22.746 --> 01:32:24.497
Elliot, that's the best place for it, OK?

01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:27.022
If they pat you down,
they're not going to search your balls.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:29.210
- You think they might see this?
- No, it's OK.

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:31.129
When you stand up, it'll be OK.

01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.380
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:33.882
Say something.

01:32:35.008 --> 01:32:37.343
OK. Hi. How are you?

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:40.221
My name's Elliot,
and I'm with the Cub Scouts of America.

01:32:40.346 --> 01:32:45.018
We're selling uncut cocaine
to get to the jamboree.

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:47.353
- Just talk regular, Elliot.
- I'm sorry.

01:32:47.479 --> 01:32:49.647
Stop fucking around.

01:32:49.773 --> 01:32:53.026
- I can't believe I'm doing this.
- You get that shit?

01:32:53.151 --> 01:32:56.237
Remember, Elliot, we're gonna be down
the hall monitoring you the whole time.

01:32:56.362 --> 01:32:59.050
Yeah? Well, what happens if somebody
does something that you can't hear

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:01.284
like pulls out a gun
and puts it to my fucking eye?

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:04.829
- We've done this a thousand times.
- We know what we're doing, OK?

01:33:04.954 --> 01:33:07.999
We're the best.
Now, listen. No fucking around.

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:11.086
Anything happens, we'll be in there
like fucking gangbusters, OK?

01:33:11.211 --> 01:33:13.963
Now, you gotta remember something.
You don't wanna go to jail, right?

01:33:14.089 --> 01:33:17.050
- Do you wanna go to jail?
- No, I don't wanna go to jail.

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:21.346
So, what do we got to do?
We got to put your boss in jail, OK?

01:33:21.471 --> 01:33:25.558
And to do that, we've gotta show in court,
beyond any reasonable doubt,

01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:28.436
that this man, a very respectable man
in the Hollywood community,

01:33:28.561 --> 01:33:31.648
is also dealing cocaine, we've gotta
prove it in court, and you gotta do it.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:35.151
That's what we're doing here. OK? You're
gonna be OK, you're not gonna get hurt.

01:33:35.276 --> 01:33:38.863
OK? So what you gotta do
is that you got to get him to admit...

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:41.074
- On tape, all right?
- Uh-huh.

01:33:41.199 --> 01:33:43.493
That he's buying this coke.
OK, champ?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:45.745
- Get a hold of yourself.
- OK.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:48.706
I'm gonna get some coffee.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:54.212
Bama, you really got that
playing basketball?

01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:57.173
Yes, I got an elbow right in the eye,
then as if that's not enough,

01:33:57.298 --> 01:34:00.927
I got hurled the ball
right when I'm not looking. Wham!

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:03.721
- Right in my face.
- You should be careful.

01:34:04.889 --> 01:34:06.724
I should.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:21.281
Clarence, what the fuck
did you bring that for?

01:34:21.531 --> 01:34:24.159
- In case.
- In case of what?

01:34:24.284 --> 01:34:26.828
I dunno, what the hell
do you want me to say?

01:34:27.036 --> 01:34:30.039
Look, Clarence,
Lee Donowitz is not a pimp.

01:34:30.248 --> 01:34:33.168
I know that, Richard, but one thing
this last week has taught me,

01:34:33.293 --> 01:34:37.088
it's better to have a gun and not need it
than to need a gun and not have it.

01:34:43.261 --> 01:34:44.804
There he is.

01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:57.650
Elliot, your motivation
is to stay out of jail.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.402
Easy, easy, easy.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:02.697
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:35:02.822 --> 01:35:04.782
Hi...

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:09.329
- I guess it's about that time.
- Yeah.

01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:11.539
Here we go.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.550
You're an actor. Act, motherfucker!

01:35:29.057 --> 01:35:31.017
- Elliot.
- Yeah?

01:35:32.352 --> 01:35:34.729
- Get on your knees.
- Oh, no.

01:35:35.647 --> 01:35:36.814
What?

01:35:36.940 --> 01:35:38.834
- I said get on your fucking knees!
- Clarence, what the fuck?

01:35:38.858 --> 01:35:41.819
Shut the fuck up, the both of you!
I know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:44.822
You think I'm pretty fucking stupid,
don't you? Don't you?

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:47.533
No? Don't you fucking lie to me,
you motherfucker!

01:35:47.742 --> 01:35:50.662
He's bluffing you, Elliot!
He's bluffing you, can't you see that?

01:35:50.787 --> 01:35:53.873
I wanna hear you say it,
"Clarence, you are without a doubt..."

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:56.584
Shut up! Say it, goddamn it,
I wanna hear you say it!

01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:59.420
"Clarence, you are, without a doubt,
the dumbest motherfucker

01:35:59.545 --> 01:36:01.965
"I've ever seen
on the face of the planet." Say it!

01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:03.091
Dumb fucker.

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:07.387
- Apparently, I'm not as dumb...
- He didn't do nothing!

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:10.431
Apparently, I'm not as dumb
as you fucking think I am, am I?

01:36:10.556 --> 01:36:14.143
What the fuck is waiting for us up there?
What the fuck's waiting for us?

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:15.395
He's gonna shoot him.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.915
Tell me, or I'm going to pump two
in your face right here right now.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:19.649
Ha! He's not gonna shoot him.

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.860
- Mother-fuck!
- He's gonna shoot him.

01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:27.198
Like Nick Carter used to say, if I'm wrong,
I swear to God, I'll fucking apologise!

01:36:27.323 --> 01:36:29.033
Something's amiss, I can feel it.

01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:32.745
If anything out of the ordinary goes down,
you are gonna be the first one shot!

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.390
Clarence, he didn't do anything.
What the fuck...?

01:36:34.414 --> 01:36:37.417
Shut up, all right?
I'm gonna blow this motherfucker away.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.002
FUCK you!

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.714
I wish somebody would just come and
get me because I don't like this anymore!

01:36:42.839 --> 01:36:44.882
Get a hold of yourself,
you fucking sissy!

01:36:45.008 --> 01:36:49.595
I really wish somebody would just come
and take me away! Just take me away!

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:51.764
Hang in there, Elliot, goddamn it!

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:55.184
I can't take this, I'm sorry,
but I just can't!

01:36:55.310 --> 01:37:01.190
And I wish somebody would just come to
my rescue and everything'|| be all right.

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:04.319
- Elliot. Elliot.
- What?

01:37:04.444 --> 01:37:06.863
I'm sorry, all right?

01:37:07.613 --> 01:37:10.533
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Friends?

01:37:12.618 --> 01:37:14.412
Fuck's with this guy?

01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:16.414
Quit playing around.

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:19.542
I was playing around,
I just had to be sure. That's all.

01:37:19.667 --> 01:37:23.880
I'm sure now, OK? I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:37:24.005 --> 01:37:28.843
Oh, man, I like this Clarence kid,
this fucking guy is crazy!

01:37:39.687 --> 01:37:40.855
Yeah.

01:37:46.027 --> 01:37:47.362
Aw!

01:37:51.282 --> 01:37:52.742
Oh, man.

01:37:56.371 --> 01:37:59.582
- Are you Dick Ritchie?
- Er... no.

01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:05.630
- Do you know a Clarence Worley?
- Yes.

01:38:05.755 --> 01:38:08.758
- Do you know where we can find him?
- Yes, I do.

01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:13.888
Well, where?

01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:17.183
At the Beverly Ambassador.

01:38:17.308 --> 01:38:19.435
- Where's that?
- Well...

01:38:20.895 --> 01:38:22.814
You go...

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:25.441
No. Yeah, go down Beach...

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.985
You guys wanna smoke a bowl or...?

01:38:29.237 --> 01:38:31.489
Oh. Go down Beachwood

01:38:31.697 --> 01:38:36.119
and drive a while,
and then you gotta turn right, OK?

01:38:36.244 --> 01:38:40.206
And then you go, and you keep driving
and you keep driving.

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:49.215
- Hello, Elliot.
- Monty.

01:38:50.049 --> 01:38:51.592
Are these your friends?

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:55.304
Yeah, yeah... you could say that.

01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:58.516
- Everybody, this is Monty.
- Hi. Come on in.

01:38:58.724 --> 01:39:00.935
Lee's in the can,
he'll be out in a quick.

01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:06.774
Holy shit, look at this.
Do you believe this?

01:39:06.899 --> 01:39:08.526
It's a helicopter!

01:39:08.651 --> 01:39:11.362
Sorry, nothing personal.

01:39:11.487 --> 01:39:13.197
Clarence...

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:17.326
There ain't no need
to search me, daredevil.

01:39:17.452 --> 01:39:19.620
All you're going to find
is this right here.

01:39:19.745 --> 01:39:21.622
Now, what compelled you
to bring that along?

01:39:21.831 --> 01:39:24.208
I guess the same thing
that compelled you guys

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:26.836
to bring the heavy artillery
to a business meeting.

01:39:27.044 --> 01:39:29.839
- I'll take that.
- Well, you're gonna have to.

01:39:30.965 --> 01:39:32.925
Oh! Hi.

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:36.846
Everybody's here.
Elliot, who's who?

01:39:39.348 --> 01:39:42.477
Uh, that's Dick on the end there.

01:39:42.602 --> 01:39:45.563
Oh, that's Dick.
Dick, Elliot tells me you're quite gifted.

01:39:45.688 --> 01:39:49.358
- And, yeah, Alabama in the middle.
- Hello.

01:39:49.484 --> 01:39:51.611
- Clarence on the end.
- Lee, this guy's...

01:39:51.736 --> 01:39:54.947
Boris, please.
I'm meeting people right now, OK?

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:58.242
- Mr Donowitz...?
- Clarence, don't insult me, call me Lee.

01:39:58.367 --> 01:40:00.453
- Lee...
- Boris, shut the fuck up!

01:40:00.578 --> 01:40:02.806
Come on, everybody, don't be shy.
Come on in. Come on in.

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:04.832
OK, Lee?

01:40:04.957 --> 01:40:06.459
- Lee.
- Lee.

01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:08.127
That's right, Lee.

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:10.338
I just gotta tell you,
I really am a big fan.

01:40:10.463 --> 01:40:13.090
"Coming Home in a Body Bag"
is my favourite movie of all time.

01:40:13.216 --> 01:40:16.511
After "Apocalypse Now", I think
it's the best Vietnam movie ever made.

01:40:16.719 --> 01:40:18.513
Wow. Thank you very much,
Clarence.

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:20.097
- Lee?
- What?

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:23.851
- This guys packing. "Really?"

01:40:24.602 --> 01:40:27.647
Well, I've been pretty scared
about this whole thing.

01:40:27.772 --> 01:40:30.292
But I'm fairly confident you're just here
to do business, so look...

01:40:30.316 --> 01:40:32.151
I don't wanna be a wise guy or nothing.

01:40:32.276 --> 01:40:35.780
If you want, I'll take my gun, and
I'll lay it on the table. It's up to you.

01:40:38.908 --> 01:40:41.160
No, I don't think that's necessary.

01:40:41.285 --> 01:40:44.080
Boris, be nice.
Make everybody some coffee. OK?

01:40:44.914 --> 01:40:47.017
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

01:40:47.041 --> 01:40:48.918
Honey, sit down. Relax, relax.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.630
- Elliot, you look like shit.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:40:52.838 --> 01:40:54.924
It's completely disgusting.

01:40:55.049 --> 01:40:58.386
Er... I need to get a quick signature,
it'd be great...

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:00.471
Whatever Bonnie wants.

01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:06.727
- Like my dailies, there, Clar?
- Is that what these are? Dailies?

01:41:06.852 --> 01:41:08.396
- You like them?
- Yeah, they're great.

01:41:08.521 --> 01:41:10.523
They better fucking be great,
they cost me enough.

01:41:10.648 --> 01:41:13.651
- What did that day cost me?
- $357,000.

01:41:14.777 --> 01:41:17.238
Elliot, I swear to God,
somebody is stealing from me.

01:41:17.446 --> 01:41:19.782
What's this one called, anyway?

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:22.118
It's a sequel to "Body Bag".

01:41:22.326 --> 01:41:24.537
- Really?
- We don't have a title yet.

01:41:24.745 --> 01:41:29.041
- What does Joe like?
- Uh, "Body Bags 2".

01:41:29.166 --> 01:41:33.045
Ooh. That's imaginative.
I've got more taste in my penis.

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:36.716
This guy's really fucking funny.

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:40.011
Lee, most of these movies that win
a lot of Oscars, I can't stand them.

01:41:40.219 --> 01:41:42.847
They're all safe, geriatric
coffee-table dog-shit, you know?

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:46.684
We park our cars in the same garage.
It's all right.

01:41:46.809 --> 01:41:50.438
All those assholes make are unwatchable
movies from unreadable books.

01:41:50.563 --> 01:41:52.106
"Mad Max", that's a movie,

01:41:52.231 --> 01:41:53.959
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",
that's a movie.

01:41:53.983 --> 01:41:55.693
"Rio Bravo", that's a movie.

01:41:55.901 --> 01:41:58.130
And "Coming Home in a Body Bag",
that was a fucking movie.

01:41:58.154 --> 01:42:00.948
It was the only movie at the time
that won a lot of Oscars with balls

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.451
since "Deer Hunter".

01:42:03.576 --> 01:42:05.411
I don't believe you.

01:42:06.579 --> 01:42:09.749
What, do you like a little coffee
with your sugar, or what?

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:13.252
Lee, I'm not satisfied
till the spoon stands straight up.

01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:16.297
Give me a coffee, will you?

01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:19.900
Lee, my uncle Roger and my uncle Jerry,
both of whom were in Nam,

01:42:20.051 --> 01:42:21.469
saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag".

01:42:21.594 --> 01:42:24.114
They said to me, Clarence, that's
the most accurate Vietnam film

01:42:24.221 --> 01:42:25.848
they'd ever seen.

01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:28.243
I'll tell you something, Clarence,
when veterans in that bullshit war

01:42:28.267 --> 01:42:33.397
say that about my project, it makes
the whole thing worthwhile. Here's to you.

01:42:33.522 --> 01:42:35.667
My friend...
I'm calling you my friend, I just met you.

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:38.819
You know why?
I think cos we got the same interests.

01:42:38.944 --> 01:42:41.405
You know what I'd like to do right now?

01:42:41.530 --> 01:42:43.115
I'd like to see "Dr Zhivago".

01:42:44.784 --> 01:42:48.412
Where is it? Is there a fucking doctor
in the house, or what?

01:42:48.537 --> 01:42:49.747
Hang on a second.

01:42:49.955 --> 01:42:52.267
'Lee, when you see this,
you're gonna shit, I'm telling you.'

01:42:52.291 --> 01:42:54.585
- 'I better.'
- Bingo.

01:42:57.713 --> 01:43:00.007
- What's the guy's name?
- Donowitz.

01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:16.691
Lee, that's all practically uncut.

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:19.235
If you so desire,
you can cut that a hell of a lot more.

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.903
Don't worry, I'll desire.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:22.828
Boris, get me another cup of coffee,
will you?

01:43:22.863 --> 01:43:24.365
Me too, Boris.

01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:26.890
I have to hand it to you, Clarence,
this is not nose garbage.

01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:31.497
It's quality stuff.
Perfect merchandise.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:35.376
The only trouble is whenever I'm offered
a deal that's too good to be true,

01:43:35.501 --> 01:43:37.420
it's because it's a lie.

01:43:46.429 --> 01:43:48.229
Why don't you convince me
you're on the level?

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:51.392
Convince him. If he don't bite,
we ain't got shit except possession.

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:55.062
Boris, we got all kinds of sandwich shit
back there, make something for somebody.

01:43:55.271 --> 01:43:57.773
We got lean pastrami, nice rye,
anybody want anything?

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:00.401
- You got any aspirin?
- Yeah, sure. Get him that.

01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:05.197
Well, Lee, it's like this.

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:09.160
You're getting the bargain of a lifetime
cos I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

01:44:09.285 --> 01:44:12.685
You're used to dealing with professionals,
I'm not a professional, I'm a rank amateur.

01:44:14.123 --> 01:44:16.250
Fuck's going on?
What the fuck's going on, Joe?

01:44:16.459 --> 01:44:21.088
I can take that, sell it a little bit at a
time and make a hell of a lot more money.

01:44:21.297 --> 01:44:24.383
- What's going on, Joe?
- Elliot's too far away.

01:44:24.508 --> 01:44:27.178
Look, this is the whole ball game,
the fucking game, this is it!

01:44:27.303 --> 01:44:29.823
I'm not a drug dealer,
I'm not saying that you're a drug dealer,

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:31.599
but you're a fucking movie producer.

01:44:31.724 --> 01:44:34.084
And you got access to all kinds
of money and shit like that.

01:44:34.185 --> 01:44:39.190
Shit.
Oh, Joe, you're fucking killing me.

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:40.566
- Joe?
- Wait, shh!

01:44:40.775 --> 01:44:43.527
Now, I cannot get a million for it,
but you can, all right?

01:44:43.652 --> 01:44:47.656
So I'll sell it to you for $200,000.
You go make a million with it.

01:44:48.657 --> 01:44:51.035
Shit, it's all found money to me
anyway, you know?

01:44:51.285 --> 01:44:52.745
There he is.

01:44:56.165 --> 01:44:59.001
Me and my wife,
we're minimum-wage kids.

01:44:59.126 --> 01:45:01.545
$200,000, it means the world to us.

01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:05.925
Elliot tells me that
you're fronting for a dirty cop.

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:10.346
Elliot wasn't supposed
to tell you anything.

01:45:10.471 --> 01:45:12.932
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.351
He saw his chance
and he took it, that's all.

01:45:15.476 --> 01:45:17.686
Why does he trust you?

01:45:17.812 --> 01:45:20.523
Well, we grew up together, that's why.

01:45:20.648 --> 01:45:26.320
Clarence... if you don't know shit, then
why does he think that you can sell it?

01:45:28.197 --> 01:45:29.949
I bullshitted him.

01:45:34.245 --> 01:45:35.329
You are nuts!

01:45:35.579 --> 01:45:38.582
He's a wild man, this kid, Clarence.
I like him.

01:45:38.707 --> 01:45:40.584
- You're wild, I love it.
- Hey, Lee.

01:45:41.335 --> 01:45:44.713
I love this guy, he bullshitted him,
you believe this kid? I love him.

01:45:44.839 --> 01:45:47.299
'Elliot, I love this kid.
Monty, get the money.'

01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:49.885
That's it, fellas,
let's get these sons of bitches.

01:45:52.429 --> 01:45:54.932
Now, wait, wait.
I completely forgot, excuse me.

01:45:55.057 --> 01:45:57.810
- What's your part in this again?
- I'm his wife.

01:45:57.935 --> 01:46:00.855
Oh, you're the wife, right.
Clarence, Clarence.

01:46:00.980 --> 01:46:04.400
- What, did you beat her or something?
- No, no, she got that playing basketball.

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.904
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm sorry.

01:46:09.029 --> 01:46:11.782
- Why are you here?
- I'm an actor.

01:46:11.907 --> 01:46:15.786
Dick, if you were just a fucking actor,
you never would've got in the room.

01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:18.455
I'm friends with Elliot.

01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:21.500
He's your friend? You got problems.

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:24.086
All right, all right.
It's all right. And Elliot knows me.

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:26.922
Elliot, here. Call Joe.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:29.258
Tell that cocksucker that
the production manager reports

01:46:29.383 --> 01:46:33.971
that he's taking 30 cents of every dollar
and putting it in his own pocket.

01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:35.931
Don't you want to count your money?

01:46:36.849 --> 01:46:39.077
No, that's all right, she can count it.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:40.102
Give it to her.

01:46:43.230 --> 01:46:45.733
♪ Well, since my baby left me

01:46:45.858 --> 01:46:48.027
♪ I found a new place to dwell

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:53.073

I gotta hand it to you, Clarence.

01:46:55.284 --> 01:46:57.703
- I was cool?
- Man, you were cooler than cool.

01:46:57.953 --> 01:47:00.915
- Oh, my God, I forgot my fucking vest.
- Stupid.

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.458
- Cody, on three.
- Yeah.

01:47:02.583 --> 01:47:05.794
One. Two. Three.

01:47:06.003 --> 01:47:07.630
Police! Police!

01:47:08.756 --> 01:47:11.592
- Put your guns down!
- Get down on the floor!

01:47:13.802 --> 01:47:17.723
- Drop your gun!
- Drop your guns and back away!

01:47:17.848 --> 01:47:20.184
Both of you put the fucking guns
on the floor now!

01:47:20.392 --> 01:47:23.896
Fuck you! All you pigs, put your guns
on the floor and back away.

01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:25.824
Are you fucking nuts?
Just do what they say.

01:47:25.940 --> 01:47:28.820
- This is your last fucking chance.
- Fuck you, this is your last chance!

01:47:29.026 --> 01:47:31.111
We could kill all of you
and you fucking know it!

01:47:31.320 --> 01:47:35.157
- Now get down on the fucking floor!
- Boris! Shut the fuck up.

01:47:35.282 --> 01:47:37.076
We're all going to die here,
these are cops!

01:47:37.201 --> 01:47:38.827
So, they're cops.
Who gives a shit?

01:47:38.953 --> 01:47:42.498
Hey, Lee, something I never told you
about me. I hate fucking cops!

01:47:42.623 --> 01:47:44.375
All right,
let's be nice, guys, come on.

01:47:44.500 --> 01:47:47.252
- We don't wanna die.
- No, I certainly don't wanna die.

01:47:47.378 --> 01:47:50.714
You look like a blond Frankenstein.
Now put your gun down, you son of a bitch!

01:47:52.883 --> 01:47:55.052
- 211?
- Yeah, 211.

01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:59.181
There you go, Mad Dog.

01:48:08.691 --> 01:48:11.568
- Holy shit.
- Motherfucker.

01:48:11.777 --> 01:48:15.906
Who are these guys?
Put your fucking guns down! Put them down!

01:48:16.156 --> 01:48:18.242
Put them down, motherfucker!
Put them down!

01:48:18.492 --> 01:48:22.579
- Fuck you!
- Put the fucking guns down!

01:48:23.664 --> 01:48:26.083
How do you really think
I'm doing with Lee?

01:48:26.291 --> 01:48:28.210
Are you kidding, man?
He loves you.

01:48:28.335 --> 01:48:30.480
You don't think I'm kissing his ass
or anything, do you?

01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:34.216
You're telling him what he wants to hear.
That ain't the same as kissing his ass.

01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:38.512
Yeah, I saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag",
I loved it, I'm not lying to the guy.

01:48:38.637 --> 01:48:41.432
No, that's why
it ain't ass-kissing.

01:48:41.557 --> 01:48:44.977
What you're doing is genuine.
And he knows it.

01:48:48.605 --> 01:48:50.566
I like you, Clarence.

01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:52.443
Always have.

01:48:52.568 --> 01:48:54.111
Always will.

01:48:59.199 --> 01:49:03.912
- Put them down now!
- Put them down!

01:49:04.163 --> 01:49:06.373
Put those guns down, motherfuckers!

01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:10.627
Officer Dimes. Officer Dimes?

01:49:10.836 --> 01:49:13.047
Put them down,
motherfucker! Put them down!

01:49:14.381 --> 01:49:16.258
- Officer Dimes?
- What?

01:49:16.383 --> 01:49:18.469
Officer Dimes?

01:49:18.594 --> 01:49:20.137
- Officer Dimes?
- What?

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:23.724
Er... this has nothing to do with me
anymore, right?

01:49:23.849 --> 01:49:26.810
OK. So, I'm just gonna leave.

01:49:26.935 --> 01:49:29.080
And you guys just settle this
by yourselves, all right?

01:49:29.104 --> 01:49:30.939
Just shut up
and stay the fuck put, Elliot!

01:49:31.940 --> 01:49:33.776
How do you know his name?

01:49:33.984 --> 01:49:36.070
Why the fuck did he know your name?

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:39.364
You little piece of shit!

01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:42.177
You can forget about acting
for the next 20 years!

01:49:42.201 --> 01:49:46.080
Your fucking career is over!
Take your fucking SAG card and burn it!

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.832
You little cocksucker!

01:49:48.957 --> 01:49:52.878
I treated you like a son!
You fucking stabbed me in the heart!

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:55.380
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:58.175
Motherfucker, don't touch him!
Motherfucker!

01:49:59.051 --> 01:50:00.051
FUCK you!

01:50:05.265 --> 01:50:06.308
Cody!
