They're so different.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.531

09:33.615 --> 09:35.700
She's always asking questions.
She's very curious.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.204
And Nicky is this, uh...
a wild child

09:41.373 --> 09:43.500

Sometimes literally.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.252
-Hmm. Sounds familiar.
-Yes.

a dressing room

10:01.893 --> 10:03.478

-Oh, great.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.320
Um, can you, uh, hold this up
'cause it's...?

10:12.404 --> 10:14.322
Oh, yeah, sure.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.282
-No problem.
-SOPHIE: Thank you.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.951
You got it.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.789
SOPHIE (chuckles):
Oh, hey, I, uh...

10:22.872 --> 10:25.834
I recently saw a picture of you
in some magazine

10:25.917 --> 10:28.044
looking like one
of the Village People.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.797
Oh, yeah, that, um...
(chuckles)

10:30.880 --> 10:32.632
That was the <i>GQ</i> profile.

10:32.716 --> 10:34.175
I was trying to get press
for the nonprofit,

10:34.259 --> 10:35.969
and they insisted
that I wear a hard hat,

10:36.052 --> 10:38.805
so that's, uh, what that was.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.850
SOPHIE:
Oh. Well, it made me smile.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.977
At least it was
for a good cause.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.812
Okay,
you can let down the curtain.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.022
-KEVIN: Yeah?
-SOPHIE: Mm-hmm.

10:47.105 --> 10:48.690
-All right.
-(Sophie clears throat softly)

10:51.693 --> 10:53.611
(Sophie exhales)

10:55.613 --> 10:58.116
Yeah, this'll do.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.659
Yeah.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.370
I-I think
you'll get by just fine.

11:05.457 --> 11:06.708
So, yeah,
at first we weren't sure

11:06.791 --> 11:08.168
there'd be any interest,
but there's actually a...

11:08.251 --> 11:09.586
There's a big demand for it.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.796
These vets, they want...
they want connection, you know?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.131
They want community.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.508
Actually, this guy Hank,

11:15.592 --> 11:17.302
at a foundation pour last week,

11:17.385 --> 11:19.637
he tells me that working outside
with vets just like him

11:19.721 --> 11:21.598
gave him these little--
get this--

11:21.681 --> 11:24.100
pockets of peace.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.935
-Oh.
-Yeah. Peace that he said

11:26.019 --> 11:27.520
he didn't think
he'd ever be able to find.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.148
-Aw. Pockets of peace.
-Mm-hmm.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.901
-I love that.
-Me, too.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.821
So, how's saving lives
in the big city?

11:36.905 --> 11:38.823
-How's that going?
-Um, you know what?

11:38.907 --> 11:40.116
I'm actually saving lives

11:40.200 --> 11:43.078
outside a little town in Berlin
at the moment.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.663
Is that the-the German Berlin?

11:45.747 --> 11:47.791
Because I know there's, uh,
there's a Paris, Texas.

11:47.874 --> 11:51.378
-Uh, yeah, no. No,
it's the German one. (laughs)
-Okay.

11:51.461 --> 11:54.798
I'm-I'm working
as a traveling nurse now.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.801
-I didn't know that was a thing.
-Yeah. Yeah.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.011
Um, after my mom died,

12:00.095 --> 12:02.389
-I found this list
that she wrote.
-Uh-huh.

12:02.472 --> 12:06.643
Um, it was all these places
that she wanted to visit.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.311
So I made my own list.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.854
And we went

12:09.938 --> 12:12.941
-to Italy for our honeymoon.
-Mm-hmm.

12:13.024 --> 12:15.527
And then Paris.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.862
-You know, the French one.
-Wait, hold on a second.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.239
Did you say
that there's a French one?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.532
-There's a French one.
-Oh.

12:20.615 --> 12:22.117
-(chuckles)
-(imitates explosion)

12:22.200 --> 12:25.412
Yeah. And then my friend told me
about this traveling nurse gig,

12:25.495 --> 12:28.456
-so I just jumped
on the opportunity.
-Sounds like fun.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.916
It's got to be tough, though,
all that long distance

12:30.000 --> 12:31.167
with you and Grant, right?
I mean, that can't be...

12:31.251 --> 12:33.670
Oh, yeah, it is, but, um,

12:33.753 --> 12:36.798
you know, I can work
for a chunk and then,

12:36.881 --> 12:38.842
you know,
take a stretch off and...

12:38.925 --> 12:40.468
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.680
I will admit, the, uh,
the red-eyes are killing me.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.349
-Yeah?
-Yeah. I'm getting old.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.352
-You're getting old?
I'm getting old.
-Oh, please.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.646
Kevin Pearson doesn't age.

12:51.730 --> 12:54.399
Kevin Pearson ages.
My beard's coming in gray.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.317
-No, it's not.
-It is, it is.
I'm thinking about dyeing it.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.028
-Right here on the corner.
Check it out. Look at...
-I don't believe you.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.487
-Get in there. Take a look.
-Let me see. Let me see.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.905
(gasps)
Oh, my God.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.158
-Yeah.
-You have gray hair.

13:03.241 --> 13:04.659
You are not allowed to dye that.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.869
I said I was thinking
about dyeing it.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.954
No, I forbid it.

13:16.963 --> 13:19.424
Last year, Nicky fell off
the jungle gym

13:19.507 --> 13:21.676
and cut his chin pretty bad.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.428
It was deep,

13:23.511 --> 13:25.180
and I thought maybe
he was gonna need stitches.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.681
And the first thought
that came to my mind

13:26.765 --> 13:29.059
was that I should call you.

13:29.142 --> 13:32.187
I thought, "Call Sophie
and send her a picture.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.440
She'll tell you what to do."

13:35.523 --> 13:37.734
You could have called.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.990
You know, y-you're probably
exhausted from traveling.

13:44.074 --> 13:46.117
We should probably
get back, right?

13:46.201 --> 13:48.745
No, I think I just got
a second wind.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.352
Wow.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.982
-(sighs) Check out that view.
-Yep.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.111
(exhales)

14:22.487 --> 14:24.781
You seem really happy,
Soph. I'm...

14:26.783 --> 14:28.410
I'm glad you found someone.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.541
I am really happy, Kev.

14:39.295 --> 14:41.297
I'm also divorced.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.772
(indistinct chatter)

14:59.607 --> 15:01.609
(speaking inaudibly)

15:02.861 --> 15:05.780
-Hey, are you okay?
-Uh...

15:05.864 --> 15:08.742
I told you she was gonna
be here with her husband.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.368
Yeah.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.079
Yeah, I'm-I'm okay. That's fine.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.167
GRANT:
Because, you know,
it was like...

15:17.250 --> 15:19.252
(indistinct chatter)

15:20.795 --> 15:24.299
(quietly): All right, I'm just
gonna go say hi. No big deal.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.551
Just be super cool.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.386
Totally, yeah.
Oh, thank you very much...

15:28.470 --> 15:30.347
-Oh! Oh, my God.
-Oh, shoot.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.640
-Okay. No, it's okay.
-That's a lot. Let me-- No, no.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.684
-I'll get a napkin.
No, no, I'll be right back.
-It's fine. No, I'm fine.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.270
Oh, good, this isn't
awkward at all.

15:37.354 --> 15:39.522
Well, at least
it was, um, white wine.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.192
-Yeah. (imitates TiVo sound)
-(laughs)

15:42.275 --> 15:44.361
All right, here you go.
Get some club soda on that.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.446
-Oh. Thanks.
-It's supposed to take out
the... I can help you.

15:46.529 --> 15:47.989
-No, I got it. I'm good.
-Probably shouldn't...

15:48.073 --> 15:49.324
-GRANT: Uh, Grant.
-Hey.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.533
-It's nice to finally meet you.
-Kevin.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.118
Oh, I know. Yeah, I've, uh,

15:52.202 --> 15:54.329
I've actually seen your nipple
on every subway car in Brooklyn.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.538
Yeah, a few in Queens, too.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.166
Yeah, my Des Resistance ad.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.794
It's, uh, I've been
their nipple guy for the last

16:00.877 --> 16:02.420
half decade now.
It's absolutely ridiculous,

16:02.504 --> 16:05.215
but the money goes towards
my twins' college, so...

16:05.298 --> 16:07.717
Wow, twins, that has
got to be a handful.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.552
Can be, can be, but, you know,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.554
they blow my mind
every day, so...

16:11.638 --> 16:14.599
-I know the feeling.
-Aw.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.892
(titters)

16:18.853 --> 16:20.980
I actually liked the guy.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.692
I did, I thought he was
a really solid dude, honestly.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.527
I-I thought he was...

16:25.610 --> 16:27.904
I mean, yeah, he-he was.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.531
-Is. He is.
-Mm.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.951
That's why I was drawn to him
in the first place, but...

16:33.034 --> 16:36.663
(exhales):
I just wasn't...

16:36.746 --> 16:38.623
We don't have to talk about it.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.209
Oh, no, it's-- I'm-I'm fine.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.505
It had been over for a while.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.590
We were just going
through the motions.

16:49.509 --> 16:54.222
You know, but the whole thing,
it just kind of,

16:54.305 --> 16:56.266
you know, it forced me
to grow up.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.518
-Yeah.
-It only took me 45 years.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.936
-45 years? (groans)
-(laughs)

17:00.020 --> 17:01.396
-Only took me 44.
-Oh, okay.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.149
(both laugh)

17:04.232 --> 17:05.984
You know, the old Kevin
would be bugging me

17:06.067 --> 17:07.610
to explain why
I hadn't told him sooner.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.613
No, come on,
I've grown up since then.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.240
Different person now.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.410
-Why didn't you tell me sooner?
-(laughs)

17:15.493 --> 17:18.830
Oh, I don't know, I just...
(exhales)

17:18.913 --> 17:20.915
You know, I needed to make
peace with it myself

17:20.999 --> 17:24.044
-before I could talk about it
with anybody else.
-Mm.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.135
Your mom still thinks
we're married.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.724
The doctor calls it
a "family disease,"

17:37.807 --> 17:40.268
and, boy, it is.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.187
And we're all on this
emotional roller coaster.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.774
A-And one minute, she knows
where she is and who I am

17:45.857 --> 17:48.026
and in the next minute
she's lost out at sea

17:48.109 --> 17:52.572
in another time entirely
and I'm-I'm someone else to her.

17:52.655 --> 17:55.492
(exhales)
God.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.370
Kevin, I'm so sorry.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.455
That sounds impossible.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.045
(sighs)

18:07.128 --> 18:11.341
So, are you, you know,
dating or... (laughs)

18:11.424 --> 18:12.967
-(chuckles): Am I dating?
-Have you been dating?

18:13.051 --> 18:15.595
Well, uh, you know,
little bit, I guess.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.098
I was in a relationship
last year that I thought

18:18.181 --> 18:21.101
maybe had potential,
but, uh, it fizzled out.

18:21.184 --> 18:25.355
It's sort of my pattern

18:34.239 --> 18:39.202
You know, I think I have this
series of failing at-at dating.

You know, and he would
make the sound,

23:49.888 --> 23:51.890
like the old TiVo used to make.

23:51.973 --> 23:55.060
Well, some random Tuesday night,
there you were again, on TV,

23:55.143 --> 23:59.022
and, you know, he did the thing
like he always did, and I...

23:59.105 --> 24:02.734
I tried to play along
with it, I-I did, but...

24:04.819 --> 24:07.238
I don't know, I just,
I couldn't do it anymore.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.451
I don't know what it was
about that moment,

24:11.534 --> 24:14.120
but I just realized...

24:14.204 --> 24:16.790
that I'm never gonna be able
to fast-forward through you.

24:20.919 --> 24:23.546
That's the kind of hold
you've had over me, Kevin.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.758
That's how much I have
carried you with me. And I...

24:26.841 --> 24:29.844
And I have carried you
with me, Soph. I have.

24:29.928 --> 24:31.137
Look...

24:32.222 --> 24:34.391
It's too much.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.809
Kevin, it's too much.

24:35.892 --> 24:38.561
We have decades
of history between us.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.063
Yeah, why is that a bad thing?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.273
Because I c--
I can't go backwards.

24:42.357 --> 24:43.441
I don't want to go backwards.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.195
-I can't. I can't--
I can't do this.
-I don't...

24:47.278 --> 24:49.948
-I can't, I'm sorry,
I'm just-- I'm sorry.
-I...

24:51.408 --> 24:52.826
(door closes)

25:16.599 --> 25:18.018
ARIELLE:
Hey, he'll have a ginger ale.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.603
Yeah, and just a little ice.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.439
-That's your drink, right?
-Yeah.

25:22.522 --> 25:24.691
-(laughs softly)
-That's my drink.

25:25.775 --> 25:29.070
I like to watch people.

25:29.154 --> 25:31.865
It's one of my favorite things
to do. Especially at hotel bars.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.825
Hmm.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.578
You watch people and you take
notes and then you-you use it

25:36.661 --> 25:38.329
-as blackmail later?
-Uh...

25:38.413 --> 25:40.415
ARIELLE (chuckles):
No, I make observations

25:40.498 --> 25:42.751
and write song lyrics
about them.

25:42.834 --> 25:45.420
-Mm.
-Or at least, I try to.

25:45.503 --> 25:47.839
So...

25:47.922 --> 25:51.301
what's your best observation
about this evening?

26:03.396 --> 26:08.360
"You shift unsteady
in your seat,

26:08.443 --> 26:12.530
"your sight line at the door.

26:12.614 --> 26:17.118
"You sip your drink,
deepen your breath.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.120
"Who are you waiting for?

26:19.204 --> 26:22.415
"No, I would never leave you

26:22.499 --> 26:25.835
"lost on this
unchartered ground.

26:25.919 --> 26:29.214
"With just one glance,

26:29.297 --> 26:32.425
"I'd take my chance

26:32.509 --> 26:35.845
and let us both be found."

26:44.771 --> 26:46.314
It's yours.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.733
Yeah.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.819
Yeah, I got that. You...

26:53.405 --> 26:55.615
You are observant.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.992
Oh, gosh, I'm-- That...

26:58.076 --> 27:00.412
-Now I made it awkward.
-No, I asked you to read it.

27:00.495 --> 27:02.664
Thank you. That's, uh...

27:02.747 --> 27:05.208
It's ac-- It's very
flattering, actually.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.710
Thank you.

27:14.217 --> 27:15.844
I should call it a night.

27:18.096 --> 27:19.639
ARIELLE:
Keep it.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.308
You sure?

27:25.729 --> 27:27.147
Good night.

27:34.988 --> 27:37.198
(sighs)

27:39.951 --> 27:41.870
Hey, kid.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.956
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:45.040 --> 27:48.168
Whoa, you look about
50 shades of hangdog.

27:48.251 --> 27:50.754
-What the hell happened?
-I don't know.
You know, it's like,

27:50.837 --> 27:52.547
I spent half the night
talking to Sophie, right,

27:52.630 --> 27:54.174
and then the other half
of the night

27:54.257 --> 27:56.509
I-I'm getting hit on
through napkin poetry.

27:56.593 --> 27:58.553
-What?
-Yeah.

27:58.636 --> 28:01.348
It's just, the whole thing,
I-I just, I don't...

28:01.431 --> 28:03.224
(exhales):
God, I hate weddings.

28:03.308 --> 28:05.060
-You know?
-Yeah.

28:05.143 --> 28:06.895
(exhales)

28:06.978 --> 28:08.563
What are you doing up so late?

28:10.023 --> 28:12.359
I got to get some ice.

28:12.442 --> 28:14.319
Edie and I are gonna
try this thing where...

28:14.402 --> 28:16.696
-No, you don't.
No, you do not do that to me.
-What?

28:16.780 --> 28:19.616
-Don't want to know.
No one wants to hear that.
-What? Huh?

28:19.699 --> 28:21.659
Okay.

28:21.743 --> 28:23.453
Yeah, I don't--
Maybe this is a good thing.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.955
You know? I think I-- I think
I'm just done with love.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.165
Hmm.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.084
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

28:29.167 --> 28:30.377
It's probably for the best.

28:32.295 --> 28:35.006
Love is a tricky game.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.633
Mm.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.718
It's like that damn
<i>Dipsy Doodle.</i> (chuckles)

28:41.763 --> 28:44.224
-Hmm?
-What is it?
What's a <i>Dipsy Doodle?</i>

28:44.307 --> 28:47.936
It's a pinball game
I used to play.

28:48.019 --> 28:51.523
Friggin' game sucked me in. Mm.

28:51.606 --> 28:54.109
It was a shifty bastard,
'cause... (exhales)

28:54.192 --> 28:56.861
You know, I always kept track
of the balls it let me have...

28:56.945 --> 28:58.822
-Mm-hmm.
-...but it always changed.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.783
Just when I thought I was
done for, I'd get another shot.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.660
Hmm?

29:03.743 --> 29:06.162
You got to keep your eye
on all the balls.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.956
-(whispers): Stop
talking about balls.
-Balls.

29:08.039 --> 29:10.542
-Hey. Um...
-KEVIN: Hey.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.419
Can I talk to you
for a minute in private?

29:12.502 --> 29:15.338
-Sure. Sure.
-Okay.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.757
Uh, I have to get some ice.
Edie and I are gonna...

29:17.841 --> 29:19.718
-Oh, no, no, please.
-That's the end of the story.
No one wants to know anything

29:19.801 --> 29:21.302
-about what you're gonna
do with that.
-I don't want to hear that.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.013
-She...
-Nobody wants to know.

29:23.096 --> 29:24.305
Just-- okay.

29:26.558 --> 29:28.685
-Okay. Sorry.
-That's okay.

29:28.768 --> 29:31.438
-I know it's really late,
but, um...
-No, it's all right.

29:31.521 --> 29:34.065
-...I do really need your help.
-Okay.

29:34.149 --> 29:36.359
I've been trying to get
this dress unzipped

29:36.443 --> 29:38.111
-for, like, a half an hour.
-Ah.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.572
And I think it's stuck
on the fabric.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.824
Um, do you think
you could get it for me?

29:42.907 --> 29:44.242
Yeah.

29:44.325 --> 29:45.952
-I can try.
-Okay.

29:49.998 --> 29:52.334
-Ah. Mm-hmm.
-See?

29:55.378 --> 29:57.714
-There we go.
-Oh, there we go. Thank you.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.133
And do you mind if I change
in your bathroom? I just...

30:00.216 --> 30:02.927
don't really want to wear this,
like, a second longer.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.263
-No, I don't mind. Sure.
-All right.

30:05.347 --> 30:07.932
-I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.225
Thank you.

30:10.560 --> 30:13.104
(door closes)

30:13.188 --> 30:15.565
I really do need to find
someone, though.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.485
I can't keep bothering you every
time I need a dress unzipped.

30:18.568 --> 30:21.196
(sighs) But then I'd have
to share the details of my life

30:21.279 --> 30:25.617
with someone else every night,
share a Netflix account.

30:25.700 --> 30:29.329
-Forget it,
I'll just bother you.
-(door opens)

30:35.043 --> 30:37.712
Cass, you're never a bother.
You know that.

30:37.796 --> 30:40.882
-You know, um...
-(clears throat)

30:40.965 --> 30:45.970
So, Uncle Nicky was saying
something to me about, um...

30:46.054 --> 30:48.390
Well, he-he said--
he thinks you're my ball.

30:48.473 --> 30:51.184
-Your what?
-It's a stupid
old man metaphor thing,

30:51.267 --> 30:54.104
but he-- basically,
he was saying that...

30:54.187 --> 30:56.606
maybe you and I should, um...

30:58.441 --> 31:01.945
-We should be...
-Come on, Kev.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.780
I mean, when I met you,
I didn't want to be with you

31:03.863 --> 31:07.450
'cause I was a train wreck
and you were a vapid,

31:07.534 --> 31:10.620
-idiotic mess.
-Thank you.

31:10.704 --> 31:13.915
You know, and we have our act
together now, but...

31:13.998 --> 31:15.667
even still...

31:17.669 --> 31:21.381
...you're not my person and I'm
not yours, and you know that.

31:23.216 --> 31:25.552
(sighs)
Yeah, I know that.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.262
I do.

31:29.472 --> 31:32.684
But you're pretty much
my best friend.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.310
And my boss.

31:34.394 --> 31:37.272
Well, you're pretty much
my best friend, too.

31:37.355 --> 31:39.983
And you know what?
You're my best employee, so...

31:40.066 --> 31:43.194
I feel like you like Hank
better than me.

31:43.278 --> 31:45.363
I mean, I-- Maybe I like Hank
a little bit better than you.

31:45.447 --> 31:46.990
-(laughs)
-You're definitely
in my top two.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.783
-Oh, thank God.
-(chuckles)

31:48.867 --> 31:50.994
Um, you were kind of away
for a while tonight.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.620
Is everything okay?

31:52.704 --> 31:55.206
I'm all good. I'm good.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.499
Okay.

-This is what I got.
-Okay.

36:37.739 --> 36:39.657
Buffalo Bills
lost the Super Bowl

36:39.741 --> 36:42.160
four years in a row
when we were kids.

36:42.243 --> 36:44.245
-You remember that? Yeah.
-I do.

36:46.414 --> 36:48.416
-I'm not the Buffalo Bills.
-That's not what I'm saying.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.460
-Okay.
-Anyway, before
every Super Bowl,

36:50.543 --> 36:53.505
they make Super Bowl champion
merch with both teams on it

36:53.588 --> 36:55.965
so they have stuff ready
to go no matter who wins, right?

36:56.049 --> 36:58.176
-Mm-hmm.
-But once a team loses,

36:58.259 --> 37:01.179
they don't want the stuff
with the losing team on it.

37:01.262 --> 37:03.056
They don't want
"Super Bowl champion

37:03.139 --> 37:06.267

-Hmm.

37:06.351 --> 37:09.479

where that stuff used to go?

37:10.689 --> 37:12.023
I bet you're gonna tell me.

37:12.107 --> 37:13.191
-Other continents.
-Yeah?

37:13.274 --> 37:14.651
Africa. Asia.

37:14.734 --> 37:17.153
-Any and every nation in need.
-Huh.

37:17.237 --> 37:19.364

in the early '90s,

37:19.447 --> 37:22.033

Buffalo Bills merch

tens of thousands of people
