WEBVTT

00:55.492 --> 00:57.575
Left! 3rd!

01:09.367 --> 01:13.242
Jean-Louis Schlesser
in his mean machine,

01:13.450 --> 01:16.950
No. 10,
10, like Zidane

01:20.033 --> 01:22.992
30 meter, left Brake!

01:25.533 --> 01:28.658
World rally champion in '98 and '99.

01:28.867 --> 01:32.325
winner of the Paris - Dakar:
the man to beat!

01:37.242 --> 01:38.992
Left, top speed!

01:42.200 --> 01:45.617
Get a move on!
We'll get slaughtered!

01:45.783 --> 01:47.658
I'm flat out!

01:49.492 --> 01:52.700
The guy behind's flatter out!
Watch out!

01:54.200 --> 01:57.200
He's flashing me!
Isn't that Vatanen?

01:58.575 --> 02:00.908
No, a taxi!

02:02.575 --> 02:05.575
Move your crate!
I'm working here!

02:06.117 --> 02:08.991
- Is it the right road?
- Short cut!

02:09.782 --> 02:10.741
Short cut...

02:11.283 --> 02:13.825
- Don't let a taxi win!
- No way!

02:18.075 --> 02:22.158
Sorry, folks.
A tourist's blocking the road!

02:22.367 --> 02:24.450
It looks more like a race car.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.492
It's just a clown in a "babe magnet"!

02:27.700 --> 02:30.700
A taxi on our tail sure looks bad!

02:30.908 --> 02:32.325
I'll shake him now!

02:35.117 --> 02:37.325
He rammed me!

02:38.408 --> 02:41.075
Enough! We'll be here all week!

02:48.992 --> 02:51.700
Nearly there, lady.

02:57.367 --> 03:00.658
Why... why are there so many people here?

03:00.867 --> 03:02.617
They're on vacation.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.700
Oh, right!

03:04.950 --> 03:07.617
C'mon. Jean-Louis! Bravo, Jean Louis!

03:07.825 --> 03:11.158
No. 10...
It's not Schlesser!

03:11.533 --> 03:12.658
A taxi...

03:18.533 --> 03:21.242
I didn't catch his number...

03:31.533 --> 03:33.075
17 min., 25 sec!

03:34.658 --> 03:38.742
People always throw up after!
Never during.

03:39.408 --> 03:41.158
Ok, lady?

03:42.367 --> 03:45.533
Who's it for?

03:45.742 --> 03:47.283
Her! Her water broke!

03:48.492 --> 03:52.158
- You're giving birth!
Well, I ain't knitting!

03:52.367 --> 03:54.992
Get the gear! We'll do it here!

03:55.200 --> 03:59.533
Hey doc. I gotta run.
Use the ground, not my seat!

03:59.742 --> 04:01.658
Water's broken!

04:01.867 --> 04:03.408
Water breaks!

04:04.908 --> 04:06.700
Push!

04:07.533 --> 04:10.492
Breathe! Push!

04:16.867 --> 04:17.783
Hi, Lilly

04:17.992 --> 04:21.158
30 minutes late
for lunch with my folks!

04:21.367 --> 04:22.908
Yeah, I'm on my way.

04:23.117 --> 04:26.325
Daniel, you're finally meeting my Dad!

04:26.533 --> 04:28.408
He's expecting you!

04:28.617 --> 04:31.325
This is a super-big emergency!
Top-octan!

04:31.533 --> 04:34.075
What are my folks? Diesel?

04:34.283 --> 04:35.700
Lilly, come on!

04:35.908 --> 04:40.450
Mom's edgy. Dad's pacing the floor.
But hey, take your time!

04:40.658 --> 04:43.867
I can't help it
I'm stuck tight here!

04:47.492 --> 04:49.825
"Stuck"?
Who's yelling?

04:50.075 --> 04:51.908
It's... a woman.

04:52.117 --> 04:55.950
Thanks!
I guessed that much!

04:56.158 --> 05:00.325
I'm just watching.
It's not what you think. You hear me?

05:00.533 --> 05:02.575
I can hear that bitch!

05:02.783 --> 05:04.658
Is it someone I know?

05:04.867 --> 05:08.575
No! I don't know her either!
I just met her!

05:08.783 --> 05:11.950
Oh, I feel it now! I feel it!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.408
Don't fuck with me!

05:16.617 --> 05:20.742
You got some slut there
while I wait for you!

05:20.950 --> 05:26.117
No! This big woman's yelling 'cause
her water snapped! Her husband's here.

05:26.450 --> 05:29.158
Husband, too? A threesome in a car?

05:29.367 --> 05:33.700
Oh, no! Someone tell her!

05:33.908 --> 05:36.742
I don't know I can. Here.
This is your fault.

05:36.950 --> 05:40.908
I'm the husband. -
It's marvelous! - Push.

05:41.158 --> 05:44.325
Listen to me...
Daniel. He's dead meat!

05:44.533 --> 05:49.158
He's all shook up, that's all.

05:49.408 --> 05:51.283
Want to talk to the doctor?
A doctor, too!

05:51.492 --> 05:53.825
Lilly, I swear it's the truth!

05:54.408 --> 05:57.367
The baby's coming out.
Push!

05:57.950 --> 05:59.992
It's a baby. I swear!

06:00.283 --> 06:01.742
Baby?

06:01.992 --> 06:04.742
I see the head! I think it's a head!

06:04.992 --> 06:09.742
Your baby?
No it's not!

06:09.950 --> 06:13.492
He's nothing like me, I swear!
He's as wrinkly as an old garden gnome!

06:13.867 --> 06:16.533
Marvelous!
It's marvelous.

06:16.742 --> 06:19.658
You're messing me about?
Just listen!

06:19.867 --> 06:25.742
This woman... a boy just gave birth.
Outside the clinic, in my taxi.

06:25.950 --> 06:28.825
She's ruined my back seat!

06:29.658 --> 06:32.325
Don's hit that poor kid!
I can't hear a thing now!

06:32.533 --> 06:35.075
Marvelous!

06:36.117 --> 06:38.867
You be there when I give birth!

06:39.117 --> 06:43.617
I can sit and wait if you like.
This place looks fine.

06:43.825 --> 06:46.533
You got 10 minutes!

06:46.783 --> 06:51.658
Not twins? Is it a wrap?
No offense, but I gotta run!

06:52.533 --> 06:56.117
Ah, hon! Problem with your friend?

06:57.033 --> 07:01.867
An emergency at the hospital.
A difficult birth.

07:02.075 --> 07:06.200
I understand. Saving lives all day.
I respect that.

07:12.575 --> 07:16.533
I don't know what to say.
You were wonderful!

07:16.742 --> 07:17.825
I know!

07:18.033 --> 07:21.367
I hope you won't lose your license.

07:21.575 --> 07:25.242
I don't have one!

07:27.908 --> 07:32.325
I am quite pleased...
moved, even...

07:32.533 --> 07:36.867
to give you... first...

07:38.533 --> 07:40.242
driver's... license!

07:40.408 --> 07:42.492
- You sure?
- Yup!

07:42.700 --> 07:44.950
I don't want to twist your arm.

07:45.158 --> 07:48.283
No doubt about it.

07:48.492 --> 07:51.367
It's just fine!
It's not 'cause it's my 27th time?

07:51.533 --> 07:54.575
Your 100th time would be the same!

07:54.783 --> 07:56.992
You're ready... really ready.

07:58.825 --> 08:01.617
- Ok, I accept.
- That's fine.

08:01.825 --> 08:03.783
- I'll back out.
- No!

08:05.242 --> 08:09.742
Leave it!
Don't touch! Leave it!

08:09.950 --> 08:13.158
- I'll do it! I'll sort it out!
We'll sort it out!

08:14.450 --> 08:16.658
Don't I have my license?

08:16.867 --> 08:18.533
Yes, you do!

08:18.742 --> 08:22.992
But don't go to extremes.
Take it smoothly.

08:23.200 --> 08:29.408
Your license is in your hand.
Now you go home... on foot! See?

08:29.908 --> 08:33.450
I see.
I'll call tomorrow in case you regret it.

08:33.658 --> 08:38.366
No! I won't be around
nor the following days.

08:38.741 --> 08:41.700
I got transferred to Paris.

08:42.158 --> 08:44.908
This is a leaving present?

08:45.117 --> 08:48.200
For my most regular pupil!

08:50.658 --> 08:52.575
Yeah, right..."Regular"

08:56.325 --> 08:58.242
Car Weekly, Please.

09:00.075 --> 09:03.408
That's ok. My pleasure!

09:11.075 --> 09:13.283
Mom, he's here! Mom!

09:13.575 --> 09:15.617
Yes, of course! Let's eat!

09:28.408 --> 09:30.492
Sorry, it won't happen again.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.561
Not if you screw this up!
There won't be a next time.

09:33.562 --> 09:34.992
My dad's real strict.

09:35.200 --> 09:39.200
Oh, come on.
deep down, he must be nice.

09:39.533 --> 09:42.408
His daughter's eyes are so blue!

09:42.617 --> 09:44.700
You just be careful!

09:44.908 --> 09:49.367
Don't worry. It'll be ok.
I know I'll like him, so he'll like me!

09:50.325 --> 09:52.033
- Is he a cop?
- No!

09:52.242 --> 09:56.617
Ok, then!
Ain't nothing worse than a cop!

09:59.658 --> 10:03.242
Dad? I'd like you
meet my boyfriend, Daniel.

10:08.575 --> 10:11.575
You're a doctor?

10:13.033 --> 10:15.283
Go on... knock him dead!

10:18.033 --> 10:21.950
Pleased to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

10:22.158 --> 10:26.075
Are you deaf or won't you answer?

10:28.408 --> 10:31.408
I'm not a doctor...
I'm an apprentice!

10:31.617 --> 10:33.492
What year?

10:33.700 --> 10:37.242
1st... I mean
I'm about to change into 2nd.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.575
2nd year?

10:39.783 --> 10:41.742
- You're not young.
- Edmond!

10:41.950 --> 10:46.075
What? I'm just inspecting
a new recruit. Answer!

10:46.325 --> 10:49.992
Sir, I'm not young
but I've done lots of jobs

10:50.200 --> 10:54.158
to feed my family
and pay my licens... studies.

10:54.367 --> 10:58.200
I started when I was 12
so I've aged.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.950
What jobs?

11:00.158 --> 11:03.200
I drive a taxi... ambulance. Ambulance!

11:03.408 --> 11:05.575
I got delayed at the clinic.

11:05.783 --> 11:10.533
It lets me keep my hand in.
Eye on the road, eye on the patient.

11:10.742 --> 11:13.825
2 things at once?
You make mistakes!

11:13.992 --> 11:19.283
Excuse me, sir, but I disagree.
Just look at you.

11:20.117 --> 11:21.825
Oh? What do you mean?

11:22.033 --> 11:24.742
I see a lot of decorations there

11:24.950 --> 11:27.867
proving you've had a successful career.

11:28.367 --> 11:33.158
I see Lilly pretty,
intelligent, well-educated.

11:33.367 --> 11:37.492
You clearly managed
to do 2 things at once.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.908
I drove an ambulance, too.
in '59, in Algeria.

11:44.117 --> 11:46.408
Eye on the road,
eye on the machine gun!

11:46.617 --> 11:50.908
See to the injured later
if they're still alive!

11:51.117 --> 11:54.408
Edmont? I'd like to see to my roast beef!
Before it burns.

11:54.617 --> 11:57.617
Affirmative! I'm starving! Forward!

11:58.325 --> 12:02.367
Now, the endurance test:
3 hours of war stories!

12:02.575 --> 12:06.492
I'll slip into neutral
and cruise through!

12:10.950 --> 12:13.408
- I hurt you?
- Not at all.

12:13.617 --> 12:16.825
Good. I heard your hip crack.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.408
- It's mine!
- Let's stop.

12:20.617 --> 12:23.075
I'm fine!

12:23.283 --> 12:27.450
I don't want to hurt you
but I'll be Ok.

12:27.658 --> 12:29.742
I'm Ok now.

12:29.950 --> 12:35.200
I could've massaged it for you...
but if you're Ok... fine!

12:36.033 --> 12:38.408
The surface pain's gone,

12:38.617 --> 12:42.325
but deep down, there's nagging pain,
stiffness.

12:42.533 --> 12:45.658
Maybe a little massage would ease it.

12:46.992 --> 12:51.325
Ok, guys, a match to finish,
for 5 minutes.

12:51.992 --> 12:53.283
Bow!

12:53.450 --> 12:56.283
- Change partners?
- No.

12:56.533 --> 12:59.075
Go!
I really don't want to hurt you.

12:59.283 --> 13:03.117
I'm touched by your concern. Emilien.

13:08.117 --> 13:10.367
Really?

13:10.575 --> 13:15.325
Now I warn you. I started, aged 4.
I can teach you a thing or two!

13:22.658 --> 13:27.492
Your smile could melt a radiator!
You put me off!

13:30.533 --> 13:35.158
Real opponents don't smile!
It's not fair!

13:40.575 --> 13:42.908
Listen up, you sumos!

13:43.117 --> 13:46.783
Meeting with the boss in 5 minutes!

13:48.867 --> 13:51.450
What's up? You lost your lense?

13:51.700 --> 13:55.992
I can see you well enough
to kick your ass!

13:56.325 --> 13:58.867
Just trying to help!

14:00.950 --> 14:03.325
You done much judo?

14:03.575 --> 14:06.783
No, only a couple of times.
It's not my sport.

14:06.950 --> 14:08.908
- So, what is?
- Karate.

14:09.117 --> 14:11.117
Far more effective!

14:11.325 --> 14:14.783
Mine's ping pong. No good in fights,
same principle:

14:14.992 --> 14:17.117
Spirit of Rising Sun!

14:21.658 --> 14:23.492
Con-nichon-a!

14:23.700 --> 14:27.867
It's easy. "Con"...
"consummate idiot" like Emilien!

14:29.033 --> 14:31.117
Thanks!
Then, "ninny" like...

14:31.325 --> 14:34.992
Sorry, Petra.
it's just an example.

14:35.158 --> 14:37.450
And "a" as in "aaaa"!

14:37.700 --> 14:40.825
Now, you.
Con-nichon-a!

14:44.908 --> 14:46.617
Not bad.

14:46.825 --> 14:49.825
- What's it mean?
- "It means "hello" in Japanese.

14:49.992 --> 14:53.492
And don't forget it.
In under an hour, in ol' Marseille,

14:53.700 --> 14:58.075
We greet Japan's Defense Secretary.

14:58.283 --> 15:01.700
Mr Tefu... Temuchila...

15:03.533 --> 15:08.200
Mr Tef... Tejus... just call him Nip!
The Nip's from Tokyo.

15:08.408 --> 15:13.950
Before the Franco-Japanese
summit after bastille Day in Paris

15:14.825 --> 15:18.325
he's visiting our charming town.
Know why?

15:18.533 --> 15:21.075
- The climate?
- The sights?

15:21.283 --> 15:23.325
- Sure.
- The food?

15:23.533 --> 15:26.075
- The Pastis?
- The soccer match!

15:26.283 --> 15:29.117
You're a big bunch of nerds!

15:29.325 --> 15:33.200
Our anti-gang training base!

15:35.158 --> 15:37.700
Con-nichon-a!

15:37.908 --> 15:42.242
The Japs have a problem
with Jacuzzi... Yakuza

15:42.450 --> 15:46.825
who are even kidnapping
members of government.

15:48.033 --> 15:52.367
The Defense Secretary
visited England, Germany and France.

15:52.533 --> 15:54.450
Let's get one thing clear:

15:54.700 --> 15:58.783
the Krauts and Limeys
mustn't win the contract.

15:58.992 --> 16:03.117
Let's make this World Cup II!

16:03.325 --> 16:06.700
I put together a detailed operation

16:06.908 --> 16:11.367
which I will now explain.
I called it...

16:11.575 --> 16:13.033
Operation.

16:13.492 --> 16:15.617
Ninja!

16:20.117 --> 16:21.825
He's got no more ammo!

16:22.033 --> 16:24.742
Suddenly... no more ammo!

16:24.950 --> 16:27.658
Well, that's only natural.

16:27.867 --> 16:29.700
Yeah, only natural.

16:29.908 --> 16:33.450
I turn to Raymond.
Here it is.

16:35.408 --> 16:37.325
I shake him.

16:37.533 --> 16:41.533
"Raymond, your ammo!"
I say. No answer!

16:41.867 --> 16:44.242
I shake him again.
Then...

16:46.992 --> 16:49.950
he falls sideways. Dead!

16:50.200 --> 16:52.283
- Terrible!
- My whole unit!

16:52.492 --> 16:55.200
I'm alone.
Armored car's on fire

16:55.408 --> 16:59.408
radio's out...
My flask's half-empty!

16:59.783 --> 17:02.033
Oh, no! So, then what?

17:02.242 --> 17:04.407
- I prayed!
- Well done!

17:04.617 --> 17:08.575
That's all I could do.
Only a miracle'd save me!

17:10.075 --> 17:11.782
A miracle! We're saved!

17:11.992 --> 17:15.742
No! Now what? Get that, hon.
I'm in battle!

17:15.992 --> 17:18.282
Edmont, the red phone!

17:19.907 --> 17:22.992
The red phone?
Excuse me.

17:25.907 --> 17:28.075
General Bertineau speaking.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.992
It's you. Bertrand on the red phone?

17:31.200 --> 17:34.117
Well done, Daniel.
You'll get dessert!

17:34.367 --> 17:37.825
My god! I completely forgot!

17:38.075 --> 17:41.950
No problem! I'll be there!
Catastrophe!

17:42.450 --> 17:45.783
We'll wait.
I'll be 1 hour!

17:45.992 --> 17:49.408
- I want you right now.
- Give me 20 seconds!

17:49.617 --> 17:50.992
The airport, fast!

17:51.408 --> 17:53.617
That's kind a long!

18:02.325 --> 18:04.367
Catastrophe!

18:05.867 --> 18:07.575
Dad!

18:07.783 --> 18:10.950
You OK? You hurt?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.700
Catastrophe!

18:18.908 --> 18:21.617
She won't go so good now!

18:21.825 --> 18:25.908
In 15 minutes I'm to greet
Japan's Defense Secretary.

18:26.117 --> 18:29.617
Catastrophe!
I'll get you there in time.

18:29.825 --> 18:32.450
15 minutes. Impossible!

18:32.950 --> 18:36.283
Try me, sir!

18:59.492 --> 19:02.242
Seatbelt, please. Dad.

19:03.117 --> 19:06.367
Is this your ambulance?
No, a taxi.

19:06.575 --> 19:09.325
My brother loaned it to me.

19:10.283 --> 19:14.158
Save me some dessert.
You can have seconds!

19:16.617 --> 19:19.617
- Let's go.
- Sure!

19:56.117 --> 19:58.992
We're crawling 'cause of these tires
but they'll soon warm up!

19:59.158 --> 20:02.533
Don't overheat!
Now look, kid.

20:34.158 --> 20:35.783
This is the new

20:36.033 --> 20:40.533
Cortex 500.
The Rolls Royce of speed traps!

20:42.033 --> 20:45.117
Turn it on. Instant read out.

20:48.033 --> 20:49.617
Go to the roadside.

20:52.533 --> 20:55.200
Put your arm out slightly.

20:58.825 --> 21:02.117
You better learn on the old model.

21:06.867 --> 21:11.617
- We're on the highway?
- Now I can step on it!

21:11.825 --> 21:12.950
You must like hospitals!

21:15.075 --> 21:16.617
Catastrophe!

21:25.075 --> 21:26.492
Chief! We got one!

21:27.075 --> 21:28.742
A biggie!

21:32.200 --> 21:34.423
306?

21:34.423 --> 21:34.575
I think it was a 406.
And not factory-fresh!
306?

21:34.575 --> 21:37.617
I think it was a 406.
And not factory-fresh!

21:37.825 --> 21:40.700
306 km/h, moron!
Tell the others!

21:41.867 --> 21:45.200
A white taxi at 306 km/h, I repeat...

21:45.408 --> 21:48.367
- 306 km/h!
- Yup, 306!

21:48.575 --> 21:49.992
We'll get him!

21:54.325 --> 21:56.700
You Ok, sir?

22:02.283 --> 22:05.158
It's him! I must get there!

22:05.367 --> 22:07.117
Change of tactics!

22:10.700 --> 22:14.367
- What? This isn't it!
- It's short cut!

22:23.450 --> 22:25.367
Hold on!

22:44.450 --> 22:46.783
I have a UFO on Runway 1!

22:51.492 --> 22:56.117
Yield to aircraft. We have just landed.
Outside temperature: 35 degrees.

22:56.325 --> 22:59.950
We hope you enjoyed flying with us!

23:21.742 --> 23:25.575
Excuse me, Captain, a taxi's coming.

23:26.658 --> 23:29.492
I can't hear over the noise!

23:29.700 --> 23:32.283
I repeat: taxi approaching.

23:32.700 --> 23:36.950
- I never ordered a taxi. Did you?
- No, but I know him.

23:48.075 --> 23:52.658
- 14 minutes 30!
- Great!

23:59.533 --> 24:01.450
Bertineau, why the taxi?

24:01.658 --> 24:04.575
We lost a car.
This guy saved my life.

24:15.783 --> 24:17.867
Con-nichon-a!

24:19.617 --> 24:21.075
Konichiwa!

24:21.283 --> 24:24.242
- What? What you said.
- God help me.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.183
Thank you for greeting me in japanese.

24:41.184 --> 24:43.783
Me, Gibert protect you during
your vacation... uh, stay.

24:43.992 --> 24:47.950
Our Secretary. Say hi... This is he.

24:55.242 --> 24:57.492
Dear fellow! I'm honored to meet you.

24:58.075 --> 25:02.075
I'm a member of your security team.
We wish you...

25:02.367 --> 25:06.367
a nice stay.
You speak very well.

25:06.575 --> 25:10.450
A little. If I can help
in any way, just ask.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.950
Pleased to meet you.

25:18.033 --> 25:22.033
Only the blonde girl speaks Japanese.

25:23.658 --> 25:26.575
I copy. Go back to base.

25:40.867 --> 25:44.450
Let us offer a cocktail. This way.

25:45.533 --> 25:49.700
- Does your file say you speak Japanese?
- It was embarrassing.

25:49.908 --> 25:53.117
- Yes, it does. Below my measurements.
Guess I stopped there.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.492
Do me a favor, son.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.742
- See that taxi there?
- I sure do!

26:09.908 --> 26:14.200
A taxi? Love to, lady,
but I'm busy. Another time?

26:18.950 --> 26:22.117
- Always in the right place!
- Know that guy?

26:22.325 --> 26:24.825
Bertineau, head of the Med, Basin.

26:25.033 --> 26:27.575
Lilly's dad!
No shit!

26:27.583 --> 26:31.242
- I was there for lunch.
- Unbelievable!

26:31.250 --> 26:34.458
- Yeah, I can't stand the army.
- You couldn't stand cops.

26:34.467 --> 26:37.867
I still can't. I can stand you!

26:37.875 --> 26:40.617
Don't know what you're worrying about.
Well, he seems to like you.

26:40.625 --> 26:46.742
He wants you to come to the cocktail party.
Half cops, half soldiers? That's nightmare!

26:46.950 --> 26:51.158
Prefer half mechanics,
gas station attendants? Come on.

26:51.367 --> 26:55.117
The chat's the same:
cars, sport, chicks!

26:55.325 --> 26:58.367
- You'll fit in fine.
- I'd be ashmed.

26:59.075 --> 27:02.908
Listen... if Bertineau is Lilly's father

27:03.117 --> 27:06.450
he could end up your father-in-law.

27:06.658 --> 27:11.408
What will he think if you say no?

27:11.617 --> 27:13.075
One drink, no more.

27:24.117 --> 27:26.617
- "Martini"?
- My sister's name!

27:26.825 --> 27:29.992
Come on. One for the road won't hurt you!

27:30.200 --> 27:31.575
Domo arigato.

27:31.825 --> 27:36.492
The gateau is good.
Locally made. Next to the station.

27:37.950 --> 27:41.283
Gibert.
Excuse me. I'll get you another.

27:41.492 --> 27:45.742
Don't get him too stewed
to sign the contract.

27:45.950 --> 27:48.367
No worries, I know what I'm doing.
Just softening him up.

27:48.575 --> 27:51.700
He is nearly done!
Is your plan ready?

27:51.908 --> 27:54.783
Sir, it's hearsed and rehearsed to death!

27:55.033 --> 28:01.283
It's fine-tuned... to the second.

28:06.658 --> 28:09.950
- You're not at all as I imagined.
- No offense, but...

28:10.158 --> 28:15.742
A bright 2nd-year medical student...

28:15.950 --> 28:19.700
I thought you'd be more...
Pimply?

28:19.950 --> 28:23.992
Right... and a slower driver!

28:24.200 --> 28:27.408
Yes, he's "fastest" doctor I know.

28:27.617 --> 28:31.908
Well, I'm very grateful.
Gratefully indebted to you!

28:32.200 --> 28:36.075
Ask me anything...
but Lilly's hand!

28:37.033 --> 28:40.867
Course not!
I can't think of anything else.

28:41.075 --> 28:44.825
Valid 1 year, parts and labor!

28:45.783 --> 28:48.533
- Excuse me,
- Go ahead.

28:48.867 --> 28:51.825
Emilien, start Operation Ninja.

28:52.033 --> 28:55.700
- Petra, watch him.
- Watch me?

28:55.908 --> 28:57.950
Friends with the cops?

28:58.158 --> 28:59.950
No, only with one.

29:00.158 --> 29:03.783
Good! It's rare.
Most youths are anti-cops

29:03.992 --> 29:08.658
anti-army, anti-everything!
They want to kill the father figure.

29:08.867 --> 29:11.700
Sir, my patients are waiting.

29:11.908 --> 29:16.825
Wait! 5 more minutes.
You'll find this very interesting.

29:37.242 --> 29:41.075
- Selling the Japs Peugeot?
- Nothing's impossible!

29:41.283 --> 29:43.033
This is a Cobra.

29:43.283 --> 29:48.117
Specially designed protect
visiting dignitaries.

29:48.325 --> 29:49.908
Titanium-bodywork.

29:50.117 --> 29:53.658
The multiple side panels
can resist any bullet!

29:53.867 --> 29:58.950
Missile detectors, front and back!
Coating: Phantom!

29:59.283 --> 30:03.450
Solid tires!
It's linked to the Atlas satellite

30:03.658 --> 30:07.950
and if necessary, can piloted from HQ.

30:09.075 --> 30:11.033
Now, the engine.

30:12.075 --> 30:13.825
Ninja!

30:17.158 --> 30:19.075
Nice noise for a V12.

30:19.283 --> 30:23.283
V12 engine, twin turbos.
Voice-activated!

30:23.492 --> 30:26.450
Top speed: 336 km/h!

30:26.658 --> 30:30.700
Range: 880 km. Paris-Marseille

30:30.908 --> 30:34.742
2 airbags in front,
2 in back, 4 at the sides.

30:34.950 --> 30:37.658
8 in all for maximum protection.

30:39.450 --> 30:43.742
Ladies and gentlemen:
This car is like France:

30:43.950 --> 30:45.533
indestructible!

30:49.575 --> 30:52.950
Get him out! That's just 'cause
we set it to ultra-sensitive.

30:53.158 --> 30:56.658
It's usually on "normal"!
Be careful!

30:58.617 --> 31:00.367
See the balloons?

31:00.533 --> 31:03.117
Useful against thieves!

31:03.575 --> 31:07.075
Get him out! Hold on to his head.

31:07.658 --> 31:10.075
Tell him not to worry.

31:13.492 --> 31:15.992
He needs the bathroom.

31:16.200 --> 31:18.617
- Bertrand, go with him.
- Yes, sir.

31:19.867 --> 31:23.283
Get him out? Good.
It'll be good as new in no time.

31:26.325 --> 31:30.158
Will he?
Now who'll drive it?

31:30.367 --> 31:34.325
I have a young civilian driver.
He's very good.

31:34.533 --> 31:36.283
I'll vouch for him.

31:37.950 --> 31:39.492
Really?
Banco!

31:41.825 --> 31:44.172
Before your tour of the town

31:44.173 --> 31:48.867
I'll show you our latest
computing innovation.

31:56.575 --> 31:59.992
- Gimme that.
- Wear this.

32:00.200 --> 32:05.283
It'll cramp my style.
Even a cretin with mitts on...

32:05.292 --> 32:08.992
could drive this baby!
Take him away! No it's OK.

32:11.983 --> 32:13.700
Told you!
Never mind.

32:13.708 --> 32:16.908
No one'll see.
Go on! Ninja!

32:19.700 --> 32:24.533
- How do you stop it?
- You just have to say "Nip".

32:25.325 --> 32:26.742
Ninja!

32:26.950 --> 32:30.922
The mission is simple. We
prepared a demonstration...

32:30.923 --> 32:32.908
Get it? With fake attacks!

32:33.117 --> 32:37.908
Like the ghost train?
Yes, so as to impress the Nip,

32:38.450 --> 32:40.450
Ninja!

32:40.658 --> 32:44.200
Above all, don't worry.
Let things happen.

32:44.408 --> 32:47.242
- If the Nip...
- Ninja!

32:47.408 --> 32:51.575
- Don't play while I'm talking.
- Not me. You keep saying "Nip"!

32:51.950 --> 32:53.450
Ninja!

32:53.908 --> 32:55.783
- Great!
- Not bad.

32:56.825 --> 33:01.533
Sir, we shall now escort you
to your hotel.

33:01.742 --> 33:03.992
Get in!

33:07.408 --> 33:10.242
- Konichiwa!
- Up shit creek again!

33:21.450 --> 33:23.325
Forward!

33:51.908 --> 33:54.117
They're here.

33:55.117 --> 33:58.450
On this road.
It's going as planned.

33:58.658 --> 34:01.742
Very good, Katano.
Let me hear them.

34:07.158 --> 34:11.324
Spring Roll come in.

34:13.324 --> 34:15.449
Hey, Emilien, come in!

34:16.449 --> 34:19.283
- Do you hear me?
- Loud 'n' clear.

34:19.492 --> 34:23.617
We just left.
1st trap. Be with you in 20 minutes.

34:23.824 --> 34:27.117
OK.
20 minutes to warm up.

34:30.533 --> 34:34.449
What about us?
What can we do for 20 minutes?

34:34.658 --> 34:36.492
I don't know.
Any ideas?

34:37.199 --> 34:40.699
Yeah, but 20 centimeters...
minutes is too short!

34:40.908 --> 34:46.842
Oh yeah? So, we need an idea,
we could start now and finish later.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.992
Yes, that'd work!

34:50.199 --> 34:53.283
But... I too... have an idea,

34:53.824 --> 34:57.158
I'm sure... you'll really like it.

34:57.533 --> 35:00.158
- Oh yeah?
- It may be the same one.

35:00.325 --> 35:06.600
That'd be marvelous!
It'd be ideal! Go on, you first.

35:09.075 --> 35:14.867
Make the most of these few quiet moments...
to...

35:15.825 --> 35:18.242
learn Japanese!

35:18.450 --> 35:20.242
It wasn't the same idea.
Right.

35:24.283 --> 35:27.325
He won't see much of Marseille.

35:27.533 --> 35:30.992
Sorry, he's suffering from jetlag.

35:31.492 --> 35:34.700
May I ask...
why your boss is here?

35:34.908 --> 35:39.158
To sign very big contract
and see anti-gang method.

35:39.450 --> 35:42.575
- He'll sure see that!
- You know method?

35:42.783 --> 35:45.825
Sure I do!
1st, the suspect.

35:46.033 --> 35:50.367
He is probably guilty.
A foreigner is doubly suspect!

35:50.575 --> 35:56.283
There's the guilty.
Foreign, tanned suspect!

35:56.492 --> 36:01.783
He's had it! If he's tanned he just
sun-bathes and does nothing all day.

36:02.158 --> 36:04.700
He is a suspect! So, he's guilty.
Faultless logic!

36:04.908 --> 36:08.075
- That boy any good?
- Very good.

36:08.283 --> 36:10.658
A doctor, friend of my daughter's.

36:10.867 --> 36:14.033
Something tells me
they're flirting.

36:14.242 --> 36:16.742
Only natural at their age.
Quite.

36:16.992 --> 36:21.742
To make the guilty party confess
they use questioning!

36:21.950 --> 36:25.283
Simple!
They apply trilogy like Star Wars.

36:25.492 --> 36:29.533
Episode 1: Beat him up!
Good, healthy exercise!

36:29.742 --> 36:34.658
Episode 2: Tax 'em to raise some cash
for the Christmas!

36:34.867 --> 36:37.408
Episode 3: drink copiously!

36:37.617 --> 36:42.783
I'm pleased youngsters
still respect our values.

36:43.033 --> 36:45.492
- A good son-in-law.
- Think so?

36:45.700 --> 36:47.408
Many French gangs?

36:47.617 --> 36:51.575
The most dangerous are the heavy mob.
100,000-strong!

36:51.783 --> 36:54.992
Easy to spot. Wears a whistle.
Always guzzling beer!

36:58.700 --> 37:02.075
- Go toward the port.
- My pleasure, chief.

37:02.325 --> 37:06.117
- He sounds very polite.
- Affirmative. Courteous, too.

37:06.283 --> 37:11.117
Polite to your face...
shaft you from behind!

37:11.450 --> 37:15.575
Like in the souk.
A big smile as they steal your cash!

37:16.450 --> 37:18.950
But I've got my eye on him.

37:24.658 --> 37:26.242
Tell me something.

37:26.450 --> 37:30.117
I've not been in the police long
but try me.

37:30.325 --> 37:32.686
What means the word
your captain uses: "Nip"?

37:32.687 --> 37:33.867
Any special meaning?

37:35.825 --> 37:40.408
Why'd he stop? I said to beware!
What's going on?

37:40.742 --> 37:45.325
Just a simultaneous translation problem!
Ninja!

37:48.575 --> 37:52.700
Cut the crap.
We're at the meeting point in... now.

38:13.492 --> 38:16.867
- Don't worry!
- General alert.

38:36.533 --> 38:39.742
Shit!
There's a missile pointing at me.

38:40.158 --> 38:41.867
Missile? What missile?

38:46.742 --> 38:53.117
Atlas real-time missile diversion. Unique!
The Limeys won't get the ball!

38:53.492 --> 38:56.658
Impressive, but where's it headed?

38:56.867 --> 39:00.325
Don't worry. Somewhere far out at sea.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.283
Shit, my boat!

39:25.283 --> 39:27.158
The high point of our show.

39:33.617 --> 39:35.158
Impressive!

39:37.367 --> 39:39.700
Very good work, Gibert.

39:39.908 --> 39:44.439
Thank you, sir, I'm so pleased to be
able to try out this equipment at last.

39:44.440 --> 39:45.950
I'm so pleased.

39:58.325 --> 39:59.700
Roadhog!

39:59.908 --> 40:02.117
OK, the coast is clear.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.158
Ninja!

40:07.950 --> 40:11.158
- Impressive.
- You get used to it.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.575
A regular day in Marseille.
I see.

40:26.783 --> 40:30.617
Your moves are improving, but not accent.

40:31.992 --> 40:34.200
Oh? Spring Roll!

40:34.408 --> 40:38.075
Copy? Just fine. Did you make it...
I mean, are you here?

40:38.283 --> 40:42.117
1st attack completed.
Be with you in 5. Ready?

40:45.158 --> 40:49.617
Petra and I were checking
a few things out.

40:49.867 --> 40:53.825
Emilien, Gibert here.
I'm counting in you.

40:54.408 --> 40:57.075
You can count on me, Petra.
I mean...

40:57.283 --> 40:59.992
You can count on Petra!

41:00.367 --> 41:02.617
Count on Petra!

41:03.075 --> 41:06.117
Go!

41:31.950 --> 41:35.325
- Dammit, I told you to warm up!
- We're hot! Sure!

41:35.533 --> 41:39.492
Gibert will kill you guys! Go warm up!

41:41.575 --> 41:44.783
Just off to the little girls' room...

41:47.408 --> 41:50.283
I'll go with you. You never know.

42:06.283 --> 42:07.408
Can't you read?

42:07.617 --> 42:13.367
It says "Green light"!
Get a move on, you fag! Oh shit!

42:30.033 --> 42:33.283
Now turn left. I repeat, left.

42:33.492 --> 42:35.867
Yes, chief.
I repeat, chief!

42:39.658 --> 42:42.992
- He says you drive well.
- I'm not moving!

42:43.200 --> 42:48.492
It freaks me out
not to hear the engine speak to me.

42:54.658 --> 42:57.867
Putting in earplugs?
Do I talk too much?

42:58.242 --> 43:01.908
Nein! It's a miniature ear transmitter.

43:02.158 --> 43:04.742
Brand new! I'm on Channel 1.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.825
But how do we talk?

43:08.033 --> 43:10.408
I know you French can't handle it.

43:10.617 --> 43:14.158
but an order
isn't to be discussed!

43:14.408 --> 43:18.492
Yeah, but if you have a problem...
what do I do?

43:22.033 --> 43:24.908
Can you hear me?

43:27.575 --> 43:30.075
1 bang means yes, 2 means no!

43:33.700 --> 43:36.492
Mind if we keep chatting?

43:37.658 --> 43:39.367
That's good, 'cause...

43:40.408 --> 43:44.533
The closed door
makes it easier to talk to you.

43:47.200 --> 43:50.908
I don't dare to say things to your face.

43:53.783 --> 43:56.950
You eyes trouble me.
They're so...

43:58.367 --> 44:00.658
so blue!

44:02.033 --> 44:04.908
- What's Spring Roll up to?
- What?

44:05.117 --> 44:09.200
It's in code.
I just can't find the translation.

44:09.408 --> 44:12.450
When your eyes look at me... wow!
It's a 1st.

44:12.658 --> 44:15.533
or I had my back turned.

44:15.992 --> 44:20.492
- Part of method?
- You bet! Daniel's method!

44:21.700 --> 44:25.033
It's good to open my heart to you.

44:26.033 --> 44:28.700
You don't mind too much?

44:32.950 --> 44:34.200
Petra?

44:36.158 --> 44:39.408
- Should I go on, then?
I don't get it!

44:39.742 --> 44:44.825
Have you noticed
that I'm much closer to you now?

44:47.158 --> 44:49.158
"No"?

44:53.908 --> 44:56.158
Good!

44:57.367 --> 45:00.950
Ok, Petra, I'll say something
you may find shocking...

45:01.158 --> 45:03.700
Here goes...

45:04.033 --> 45:05.492
He'll screw up!

45:05.908 --> 45:08.908
Well... since Day One. I've known...

45:10.200 --> 45:12.242
I love you!

45:13.450 --> 45:15.367
- Well played!
- Told you!

45:15.575 --> 45:17.575
There, I said it!

45:17.783 --> 45:22.908
Now put me out of my misery:
is it mutual? So...

45:25.200 --> 45:28.367
1 bang: yes, 2 means no.

45:31.533 --> 45:34.950
Change channels to talk dirty!
We're working!

45:36.658 --> 45:39.367
- Daniel? Left here, kid.
- Yes, pops!

45:49.658 --> 45:51.575
He's not one of us.

46:02.117 --> 46:04.908
That's for sure.
He's not one of us.

46:24.075 --> 46:27.700
What're you playing at?
Go on! Ninja!

46:27.908 --> 46:30.908
Sorry to be so down:
I smell a thing.

46:31.117 --> 46:35.492
Smell trap? I don't smell a thing.
Do you, sir?

46:39.075 --> 46:43.700
Strange how those trucks are parked.
just room for 1 car!

46:45.950 --> 46:50.450
No, there's no trap.
I checked the map. No trap here.

46:50.658 --> 46:53.325
- Drive on!
- If you say so.

46:56.950 --> 46:59.075
I should know.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.950
Well, I never! A trap!

47:10.575 --> 47:12.700
What's he up to?

47:26.742 --> 47:28.408
What page?

47:41.700 --> 47:44.367
That's not on my list.

47:53.492 --> 47:55.533
Hats off!

47:57.200 --> 47:59.075
Glad it's not my taxi!

48:11.367 --> 48:13.450
Petra!

48:14.283 --> 48:16.783
What happened? Where's the Nip?

48:16.992 --> 48:20.492
Some Ninjas...
came and the Secretary went...

48:21.075 --> 48:23.450
What? He didn't fly away?

48:23.658 --> 48:27.992
He did! At that speed
he must be on his way to Mars!

48:29.867 --> 48:33.533
Ask Atlas. It must've spotted him!

48:34.450 --> 48:36.158
General alert!

48:38.658 --> 48:40.033
Stop! Police.

49:34.242 --> 49:35.533
Shit!

50:10.033 --> 50:12.617
Complex town, huh?

50:13.242 --> 50:16.408
Small streets!
The jails are no bigger!

50:16.617 --> 50:21.242
Lie down there!
I'm a crack shot so no tricks!

50:22.742 --> 50:24.992
You speak French?

50:25.200 --> 50:28.158
Me warn you: me shoot!
Spread out!

50:45.700 --> 50:48.825
Is that how you wanna play it?
All right!

50:57.450 --> 51:01.867
Now where are they?
They didn't fly away?

51:02.283 --> 51:04.617
Where's Emilien?
Emilien?

51:06.408 --> 51:09.825
I reckon he's near the garbage.

51:10.033 --> 51:14.033
I was this close to getting 'em,
but I was outnumbered.

51:14.325 --> 51:16.533
- They took the Secretary!
- Which one?

51:16.742 --> 51:20.117
The Nip, not ours.
It's a disaster!

51:20.283 --> 51:22.575
Yeah, and they got Petra, too.

51:22.825 --> 51:27.325
Good. She speaks Japanese,
so he'll be less alone.

51:55.575 --> 51:59.117
Lilly, I'm coming.
Your dad made me stay!

51:59.325 --> 52:02.992
But it's been 2 hours.
I'm hot all over.

52:03.992 --> 52:06.825
- All over?
- Yeah, all over!

52:07.033 --> 52:09.075
I'll be on fire soon.

52:09.283 --> 52:12.825
I'm coming. Watch a documentary
it'll calm you down!

52:13.033 --> 52:15.908
- I'll be 5 minutes.
- Too long!

52:16.117 --> 52:18.283
4 minutes!
Emilien!

52:29.742 --> 52:34.242
It's my fault
for leaving her in the john!

52:34.450 --> 52:38.617
- You should gone with her.
- I thought of that. I did. But...

52:41.242 --> 52:43.741
Finished scratching about yet? You've
been scratching for over one hour.

52:43.742 --> 52:44.575
Find anything?

52:44.783 --> 52:48.283
There were indeed cars here.
3 of them.

52:48.492 --> 52:52.408
You read Sherlock Holmes to deduce that?

52:52.617 --> 52:55.700
Don't you have any clues
to get us started?

52:55.908 --> 53:01.325
We'll analyze the tire samples at the lab.
That'll tell us more.

53:01.533 --> 53:05.242
They'll have time to swim back to Tokyo!

53:09.117 --> 53:12.783
Thanks for everything,
but I need my taxi, now.

53:12.992 --> 53:15.700
What I do for your convertible?

53:16.033 --> 53:19.825
We're in shit!
These clowns are shaving the road!

53:20.033 --> 53:22.450
Please help us find a clue.

53:22.458 --> 53:25.992
Look. Lilly's on fire.
She might burn herself.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.658
They got my girl.
Give me 2 minutes of your time.

53:29.867 --> 53:33.575
Take a look,
then I'll handle it.

53:38.450 --> 53:42.700
From below, I saw 3 black Mitsubishis.

53:42.908 --> 53:44.867
But not sure what model.
A new model.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.783
Tires straight from Japan.

53:47.992 --> 53:50.617
- How'd you know?
- I smell it.

53:50.825 --> 53:52.742
- Fish?
- Meaning?

53:52.950 --> 53:55.492
- A restaurant?
- You got fish oil for brains?

53:55.700 --> 53:58.250
Restaurants and... ports!
They were at the port.

53:58.251 --> 53:59.950
So, they were in a boat from Japan!

54:00.158 --> 54:04.533
That's why it smells of fish. See?

54:04.700 --> 54:08.992
Now, are they stolen cars?
Easy! Alain! I'm onto it.

54:09.825 --> 54:12.575
OK, you put your tweezers down.

54:12.783 --> 54:14.644
On Monday morning.

54:14.645 --> 54:18.367
You'll get a whistle and
be put on traffic duty!

54:20.533 --> 54:22.075
Idiots!

54:22.283 --> 54:25.908
Nothing stolen from the port.

54:26.117 --> 54:29.367
Bingo? What?
It just means you were wrong.

54:29.908 --> 54:33.825
Why wasn't the theft declared?
Why?

54:34.033 --> 54:37.450
'cause they use the warehouse as a base!

54:37.658 --> 54:39.783
You can be real smart!

54:39.992 --> 54:42.117
- General alert!
- No, Emilien.

54:42.325 --> 54:44.117
That's always my line.

54:45.325 --> 54:47.200
Tell me one more time.

54:51.325 --> 54:53.700
Lilly, I'm on my way!
You watching TV?

54:54.033 --> 54:57.422
No, I stopped. There was
a report on animal sex.

54:57.423 --> 54:59.117
I burned the rug!

54:59.408 --> 55:02.533
- Lilly's worried.
- Give me that.

55:02.742 --> 55:07.700
Tell your mom it's OK
but I need to commandeer your friend.

55:07.908 --> 55:10.617
They need help.
He did a great job. Good recruit.

55:10.825 --> 55:15.075
He'll bring me home.
You can say goodnight. Bye, hon.

55:15.825 --> 55:19.367
C'mon, let's go.
The mission's not over.

56:01.950 --> 56:03.783
What's Gibert up to?

56:04.825 --> 56:10.908
I dunno. He's been in the john for
ages making weird noises. Really!

56:27.700 --> 56:32.033
- What's up?
- I can't tell you. It's... too horrible!

56:45.783 --> 56:48.950
- They won't come, Emilien.
- What?

56:49.408 --> 56:53.950
I think this was their 1st base.
They're gone.

56:54.283 --> 56:56.325
Long gone.

57:10.617 --> 57:12.992
Suspect approaching. Asian male.

57:13.325 --> 57:16.617
They always return to the crime scene!

57:16.625 --> 57:18.233
Police academy, lesson 1!

57:18.234 --> 57:19.933
Positions!

57:22.342 --> 57:23.833
Captain?

57:24.983 --> 57:28.583
Suspects approaching front door.

57:28.600 --> 57:29.800
Perfect!

57:31.700 --> 57:33.450
I'm ready for 'em!

57:45.700 --> 57:48.242
Hey Marco, you sure about this?

57:48.492 --> 57:52.117
What?
It's the heist of the century!

57:52.325 --> 57:56.658
There's a mountain of VCRs
boxed and awaiting delivery!

57:56.867 --> 57:58.742
They're about to break in.

57:59.200 --> 58:03.242
- We got 'em!
- Emilien! You break in to your home?

58:03.450 --> 58:06.200
- Sure. - Oh, yeah?
- Well, no.

58:11.150 --> 58:13.150
Uh-oh! Are you gonna...?
Chief.

58:14.700 --> 58:17.575
I like to stay close to my men.

58:17.783 --> 58:23.242
Some action won't hurt me.
just like in the old days!

58:23.450 --> 58:27.617
- It was long ago.
- Memory is distant, Emilien...

58:27.950 --> 58:33.358
but the reflexes still intact!

58:35.533 --> 58:36.033
Believe me...

58:36.767 --> 58:38.183
Thanks!

58:44.533 --> 58:49.033
- Sure there's no cops?
- Relax, admit! There's no one here!

58:49.242 --> 58:54.033
They're all watching the game.
Every cop's in front of a TV.

58:54.325 --> 58:57.075
Ready to attack? Wait for my signal.

59:02.783 --> 59:06.700
- You worry me. It's long way down.
- It's OK.

59:06.908 --> 59:11.450
- Tie the knot. I'll do the rest.
- Uh-oh...

59:12.742 --> 59:16.367
See?
They're all at the match, like I said!

59:20.117 --> 59:22.408
Attack!

59:28.283 --> 59:30.908
Shit!

59:31.325 --> 59:36.075
- Emilien? - OK, chief.
- Banzai!

59:37.117 --> 59:39.658
Someone being knifed?

59:46.283 --> 59:48.992
- Knot's all right...
- Yeah.

59:49.442 --> 59:53.533
- Emilien.
- Maybe the rope.

59:54.242 --> 59:56.742
- You got wrong one.
- You're right.

59:57.075 --> 59:59.158
Ambulance!
Now!

01:00:17.950 --> 01:00:21.858
It's all my fault. I should never
have left her or let him down.

01:00:21.859 --> 01:00:24.842
Hey, that's enough.
Crying over spilled milk!

01:00:24.843 --> 01:00:30.133
It won't bring her back. Think!
- I am!

01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:34.600
But we don't have a single lead to go on!
- Ask the right questions.

01:00:34.601 --> 01:00:37.442
Why didn't the Yakuza kill him at once?

01:00:37.492 --> 01:00:39.367
- They need him?
- Why?

01:00:39.617 --> 01:00:42.283
- Did they ask for a ransom?
- No.

01:00:42.492 --> 01:00:45.200
Why kidnap him here?
Right.

01:00:45.408 --> 01:00:50.033
They must have had a good reason.
Why's he going to Paris?

01:00:50.242 --> 01:00:55.367
To sign contracts.
Security, trains, army, nuclear...

01:00:55.575 --> 01:00:58.408
There! Maybe they want to stop him.

01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:01.158
Makes no sense.
Why'd they do that?

01:01:01.408 --> 01:01:04.825
He's right.
Yuki Tsumoto wants to stop him.

01:01:05.033 --> 01:01:08.950
I know you.
Weren't you an air hostess before?

01:01:09.408 --> 01:01:14.533
I'm here to protect the Secretary.
I'm in counter-espionage.

01:01:14.867 --> 01:01:18.992
Funny! I too am...
Emilien, Marseille-Police.

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:22.908
- That's Daniel.
- Intern. I'm learning to be stupid!

01:01:23.117 --> 01:01:26.200
Clever!
Who's this Yuki Tsumoto?

01:01:26.408 --> 01:01:30.950
Yakuza. Controls the north.
Powerful and conservative.

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:34.617
Refuses airplanes, trains, nuclear power...

01:01:34.867 --> 01:01:37.408
France is keen to sell, he's taking steps.

01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:42.150
The Secretary won't sign
nor will Japan ever again!

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:45.783
Tsumoto sent over 2 masters in hypnosis.

01:01:46.033 --> 01:01:49.450
The Secretary, when the time is right...

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:52.950
will shoot someone
- perhaps the President.

01:01:54.033 --> 01:01:57.867
France will sever
all diplomatic ties for years?

01:01:58.075 --> 01:01:59.783
- Exactly.
- Crazy!

01:01:59.992 --> 01:02:02.686
We must free your friend
and Secretary before 11.

01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:03.833
We don't have much time left.

01:02:03.842 --> 01:02:08.533
- Sure. I better tell my boss.
- The cripple or Sleeping Beauty?

01:02:08.542 --> 01:02:12.783
- Oh, yeah. - Listen...
You both got someone to save.

01:02:12.992 --> 01:02:18.200
As we're in a rush
we better not disturb the powers that be.

01:02:18.408 --> 01:02:20.283
- No?
- Right!

01:02:20.492 --> 01:02:24.617
No Nip will beat us!
Pardon me! Where do we start?

01:02:24.867 --> 01:02:26.808
First, can you find them in Paris?

01:02:27.117 --> 01:02:29.783
- No way.
- Easy! Child's play!

01:02:57.617 --> 01:03:01.283
Thanks, Joe. You saved my life!
See you soon, pal.

01:03:02.742 --> 01:03:05.908
I've found them.
They're hiding out in southern Paris.

01:03:06.117 --> 01:03:08.658
Sure it's her?
Uh, them!

01:03:08.908 --> 01:03:13.367
3 black Mitsubishis with a blonde.
OK?

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:18.450
- OK, OK. - Not much time left.
To the airport! - No plane for 3 hours.

01:03:20.117 --> 01:03:23.533
We can't wait.
We must get there right away! Think!

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.575
Get up! It's war!

01:03:26.783 --> 01:03:30.367
- Men!
- It's me, Daniel!

01:03:30.617 --> 01:03:32.908
Daniel! The troops?

01:03:33.158 --> 01:03:37.700
Wiped out! Just us to save the day.
You're indebted to me.

01:03:37.992 --> 01:03:40.283
- Affirmative!
- I need your help.

01:03:55.283 --> 01:03:57.325
Shit! What're they up to?

01:04:07.575 --> 01:04:09.450
Cool, pall! Way to go!

01:04:09.658 --> 01:04:15.033
I really hope you know what you're doing!
'Cause I don't!

01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:17.992
- Got a better idea?
- Right now? No.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.908
Well, think fast!

01:04:42.700 --> 01:04:45.950
- I got it! Let me out.
- Too late!

01:05:06.825 --> 01:05:11.033
- Are you cool?
- You bet! Cool as ice!

01:05:11.242 --> 01:05:13.700
Just shout, OK?

01:05:15.242 --> 01:05:18.492
OK, I'm shouting!
We lost a parachute!

01:05:18.742 --> 01:05:22.950
- There are 3. 1 or 2 always screw up!
- Oh right!

01:05:27.033 --> 01:05:29.783
- Emilien. Got your license?
- Yes.

01:05:30.033 --> 01:05:33.450
So, take over here.
C'mon, move!

01:05:42.533 --> 01:05:45.283
- I'll steer us.
- Where do I go?

01:05:45.533 --> 01:05:47.242
Straight ahead!

01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:49.575
- Straight ahead? OK!
- OK! Whatever you say.

01:05:50.825 --> 01:05:54.867
Come on, just relax.
Be more zen.

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.825
That's good.
Real good.

01:06:03.658 --> 01:06:05.283
Oh, Lilly, you OK?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.200
- Who's the warbler?
- Air hostess. - Air hostess?

01:06:10.533 --> 01:06:13.533
- No, a nurse!
- You in a massage parlor?

01:06:13.742 --> 01:06:18.700
No way, Lilly! We're in the sky.
Your dad's guiding us.

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:21.742
Emilien steering.
I'm fixing a parachute

01:06:21.992 --> 01:06:24.700
the nurse is singing to calm us down!

01:06:24.908 --> 01:06:26.617
You smoke a tree?!?

01:06:26.867 --> 01:06:28.214
Lilly, listen to me.

01:06:28.215 --> 01:06:30.908
I'm trying to save Petra
and Japan's Secretary!

01:06:31.117 --> 01:06:35.325
I'll call you when we land!
Goddammit!

01:06:36.533 --> 01:06:38.992
- You OK, hon?
- Just fine!

01:06:40.492 --> 01:06:43.033
What a doubter!

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:47.575
Try to turn left a bit.

01:06:47.825 --> 01:06:51.575
Now, turn left.
I repeat, left.

01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:06.367
Hi there!

01:07:09.075 --> 01:07:12.825
It's OK! Stay calm! Marseille Police!
Move!

01:07:20.992 --> 01:07:23.033
- You know them?
- Yeah.

01:07:23.242 --> 01:07:27.283
An old pupil.
Well, I'll walk home.

01:07:29.742 --> 01:07:31.700
- OK, Lionel.
- Jacques.

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.992
- Mr Coutta. Hello there.
- How are you?

01:07:37.742 --> 01:07:41.867
- All set, Coutta?
- Just Japan's Secretary to come.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:10.200
I see her!
God, she's lovely!

01:08:10.450 --> 01:08:13.367
- I mean, she looks well.
- The Secretary?

01:08:13.575 --> 01:08:16.408
Fine.
He's exercising.

01:08:23.658 --> 01:08:26.063
Maybe we should get 'em back.

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:29.380
I've got an idea.
But we must warn your friend.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:33.892
- It won't be easy! What a jerk I am!
- Really?

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:36.658
Her earphone!

01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:39.700
Petra!

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:44.225
Are you ready to kill?

01:08:45.091 --> 01:08:47.317
You hear me? Petra?

01:08:50.742 --> 01:08:53.774
We're not far away.

01:08:54.192 --> 01:09:00.242
Get up, and turn around!

01:09:03.024 --> 01:09:06.341
Show me your hands.

01:09:10.783 --> 01:09:14.033
- What's going on?
- It's not me.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:16.825
idiot!

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:19.075
Sit down. We're coming.

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:21.825
- Easy to say!
- I got a plan.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.742
That's what worries me!

01:09:24.492 --> 01:09:29.367
You hear only what I tell you...

01:09:29.783 --> 01:09:33.283
You obey me.

01:09:37.825 --> 01:09:40.825
You do only what I tell you.

01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:53.492
I wanna go home...

01:10:02.325 --> 01:10:07.367
You're going to sleep.

01:10:11.825 --> 01:10:14.825
Raise your arms.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:23.992
Con-nichon-a!
Hey, it's my turn now! Come on!

01:10:24.408 --> 01:10:26.783
I'm not bad at hypnosis!

01:10:27.117 --> 01:10:29.575
Sit!
Good!

01:10:29.783 --> 01:10:32.692
Now lie down!

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.158
Very, very good! Now sleep!

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.700
Freeze or you'll sleep, too!

01:10:42.908 --> 01:10:45.117
OK, I'll cover you.

01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:52.367
Hey, girls, what're you doing?

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.700
No need. I had 'em covered.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.950
- It's not loaded.
- What's that?

01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:49.325
How come?

01:11:50.492 --> 01:11:53.575
It was me. I emptied the magazine yesterday.

01:11:55.283 --> 01:11:58.367
So... it was never loaded?

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:03.033
So you wouldn't get hurt.

01:12:25.367 --> 01:12:28.450
I'm late. Help me out!

01:12:31.700 --> 01:12:34.242
It's OK, I'll manage.

01:12:36.742 --> 01:12:39.450
- Jump in there! - Are you sure?
I don't want to fall down!

01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:04.117
Catch 'em!

01:13:31.075 --> 01:13:33.200
Fancy some sushi?

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:34.825
No exit, Daniel!

01:14:06.117 --> 01:14:08.242
Nips closing in!

01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.783
One less!

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.783
We'll get out here.

01:14:47.908 --> 01:14:50.367
We're too heavy.
They're good!

01:14:50.575 --> 01:14:52.867
Ask your colleagues to help out.

01:14:53.117 --> 01:14:55.492
Forget it. Paris Police hate us,
they will never help.

01:14:55.742 --> 01:15:00.150
- You just never asked 'em politely!
- What the...?

01:15:11.992 --> 01:15:14.825
You faggots not at the parade?
Soldiers ain't your thing?

01:15:15.033 --> 01:15:20.158
You'd rather stay home and gobble knobs?

01:15:20.492 --> 01:15:25.117
How 'bout a love parade?
Catch me if you can!

01:15:31.617 --> 01:15:35.617
- You went a bit far!
- Don't worry! They loved it!

01:15:38.158 --> 01:15:42.075
Catch him alive!
I'll kill him myself!

01:15:57.283 --> 01:15:59.408
Where are you?

01:16:01.658 --> 01:16:03.950
Where is Trocadero?

01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:06.117
Change at Chatelet!

01:16:23.075 --> 01:16:24.783
A bus!

01:16:39.367 --> 01:16:41.408
Oh, the Eiffel Tower!

01:16:49.867 --> 01:16:52.325
Off the grass!

01:17:06.242 --> 01:17:08.450
- Straight on!
- OK!

01:17:13.992 --> 01:17:17.492
- There's one!
- Get the taxi!

01:17:19.450 --> 01:17:20.992
- Kamikaze!
- Kami what?

01:17:22.408 --> 01:17:23.950
Kamikaze!

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:31.000
Banzai!

01:18:44.908 --> 01:18:47.450
I can't shake 'em! We're too heavy!

01:18:47.658 --> 01:18:50.992
- I'll get out!
- No, we'll figure something.

01:18:55.283 --> 01:18:57.575
- Call the General.
- General, do you copy?

01:18:57.783 --> 01:19:01.033
Loud 'n' clear!
How's your tour going?

01:19:01.242 --> 01:19:02.867
Whizzing by!

01:19:03.117 --> 01:19:07.742
He's gotta block the Dauphine tunnel.
We'll trap 'em!

01:19:08.075 --> 01:19:09.617
No problem. Give me 5 minutes.

01:19:10.867 --> 01:19:13.408
- Hello?
- Picard?

01:19:13.658 --> 01:19:15.783
- Bertineau here.
- General!

01:19:15.992 --> 01:19:20.533
- Got a spare tank or two?
- Sure I have.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.033
He better hurry up!

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.867
We're there. What's he up to?

01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:44.200
OK, sir the tunnel is blocked.

01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:47.117
- 4 mins, 32.
- Well done, sir!

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.325
Hang on!

01:19:54.575 --> 01:19:58.325
- I don't wanna play anymore!
- You wanna get shot down?

01:19:58.533 --> 01:20:01.783
No!
And I don't wanna hit a tank either!

01:20:02.158 --> 01:20:05.158
Daniel. I wanna spend time with Petra
before I die!

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:08.700
Don't worry.
I'm taking you to Heaven!

01:20:10.325 --> 01:20:12.617
I wanna stay here on Earth!

01:20:54.075 --> 01:20:58.867
- You scared me again!
- Maybe one day you'll trust me!

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:07.325
He says you're wonderful and
want's you to be his driver in Japan.

01:21:07.575 --> 01:21:11.700
Thanks, but right now,
I just want to go home.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:15.867
Yeah, we're going home.
Want dropping off somewhere?

01:21:21.575 --> 01:21:23.783
- Not the TV!
- just five minutes

01:21:24.033 --> 01:21:27.200
Your father might be there.

01:21:36.533 --> 01:21:39.950
That looks like Daniel's taxi!

01:21:47.408 --> 01:21:48.492
Emilien?

01:22:00.117 --> 01:22:03.283
Well, that's brand new.

01:22:03.533 --> 01:22:05.992
A... stealth taxi.

01:22:07.575 --> 01:22:10.408
I'll drop you at the grandstand.

01:22:10.617 --> 01:22:12.325
This place freaks me out.
