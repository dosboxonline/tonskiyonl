00:26.110 --> 00:28.738
On his 35th birthday...

00:28.779 --> 00:32.033
I decided to tell
Julius Benedict...

00:32.116 --> 00:35.036
The truth about himself.

00:39.081 --> 00:41.792
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

00:41.876 --> 00:44.295
Of a scientific experiment...

00:44.378 --> 00:46.631
Conducted by
the American government.

00:49.051 --> 00:52.888
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically...

00:52.971 --> 00:56.808
Mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

01:00.729 --> 01:03.482
He knew that,
unlike other little boys...

01:03.565 --> 01:07.320
He had not one, but six fathers-

01:07.445 --> 01:09.739
all very distinguished men...

01:09.822 --> 01:12.784
Especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

01:14.994 --> 01:16.871
And of course...

01:16.996 --> 01:20.166
He knew about
Mary Ann Benedict...

01:22.627 --> 01:24.921
The remarkable young woman...

01:25.004 --> 01:27.840
Who was selected
to be his mother.

01:44.942 --> 01:48.696
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

01:48.779 --> 01:53.535
That his mother died
while giving birth to him.

01:57.455 --> 02:00.208
Now, what Julius did not know...

02:00.333 --> 02:03.211
Not until this very moment...

02:03.336 --> 02:07.549
Was that about a minute
after he was born...

02:07.674 --> 02:12.388
His mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

03:00.396 --> 03:02.940
I have a brother?

03:02.982 --> 03:05.234
Ya.

03:05.276 --> 03:07.862
He was sent to an
orphanage in Los Angeles...

03:07.945 --> 03:11.282
At the same time I brought
you here to the island.

03:13.201 --> 03:16.955
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island...

03:17.039 --> 03:20.584
Helping me with my research.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.004
I always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

03:24.129 --> 03:26.215
How wrong I was.

03:26.298 --> 03:29.385
I must find him.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.848
Julius, Julius! Wait, wait.

03:36.892 --> 03:40.814
I couldn't believe he was going.

03:40.897 --> 03:44.693
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

03:45.985 --> 03:49.322
All of his knowledge was from books.

03:50.532 --> 03:53.326
Julius could speak 12 languages.

03:53.451 --> 03:55.870
He excelled in history, science...

03:55.995 --> 03:58.540
Mathematics, literature.

03:58.665 --> 04:01.502
He was pure in body and in spirit.

04:01.585 --> 04:02.670
Ahhh!

04:02.753 --> 04:05.673
But for the first time...

04:05.798 --> 04:08.009
Julius would not listen to me.

04:08.092 --> 04:11.554
He's probably just like me.

04:20.353 --> 04:25.235
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 Miles away.

04:28.071 --> 04:31.366
But Julius did not care.

04:31.450 --> 04:34.036
He had become obsessed
with the idea...

04:34.119 --> 04:37.581
That his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

04:37.706 --> 04:41.001
And desperately needed his help.

04:44.881 --> 04:47.050
Honey, I'm home!

04:47.133 --> 04:49.344
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no.

04:49.427 --> 04:51.888
- Get going!
- I'm going.

05:16.246 --> 05:18.248
Oh, hello, hello!

05:18.290 --> 05:20.751
Oh, my goodness!

05:27.509 --> 05:30.053
Goodbye.

05:39.688 --> 05:42.607
- We're gonna be late for work.
- I need my horoscope.

05:42.732 --> 05:46.069
- Yeah, horoscope.
- "Your judgment is at its peak today."

05:46.194 --> 05:49.281
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow."

05:49.365 --> 05:52.952
- Ooh, good one.
- I hope so.

05:53.077 --> 05:55.287
Ladies!

05:55.371 --> 05:58.457
- Vince!
- I thought you broke up with him.

05:58.541 --> 06:00.459
I did, I did!

06:03.796 --> 06:05.962
You don't mind if I talk
to your sister, do you?

06:05.986 --> 06:08.175
She doesn't mind.

06:08.259 --> 06:10.470
Don't give him any money.

06:10.512 --> 06:15.308
Uh, no, no, I promised marnie
I wouldn't give you any money.

06:19.855 --> 06:22.524
Don't look at me like-

06:22.649 --> 06:25.444
don't do that thing
with your eyes.

06:25.527 --> 06:29.114
I'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.660
You are here, and so am I.

06:32.744 --> 06:35.329
Maybe millions
of people go by...

06:35.413 --> 06:37.665
But they all
disappear from view.

06:37.749 --> 06:41.419
I only have eyes for you, Linda.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.464
I only have eyes for you.

06:46.174 --> 06:49.385
Mmm.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.515
- It's the baby klane!
- What?

06:56.060 --> 06:58.103
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:58.187 --> 07:00.689
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yeah.

07:00.814 --> 07:03.275
Where's the little shit?

07:03.359 --> 07:06.028
You'll have to be
more specific...

07:06.111 --> 07:08.322
Concerning the clientele.

07:08.405 --> 07:10.407
Benedict.

07:10.532 --> 07:13.703
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

07:13.787 --> 07:15.955
- Isn't that right, marnie?
- Who, Vincent?

07:17.374 --> 07:21.211
That weasel? That creep?

07:21.336 --> 07:25.048
I wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

07:27.759 --> 07:31.221
Take out
the papers and the trash

07:31.304 --> 07:34.849
or you don't get
no spending cash

07:34.892 --> 07:37.561
if you don't scrub
that kitchen floor

07:37.687 --> 07:42.066
you ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

07:42.149 --> 07:45.486
yakety-yak don't talk back

07:45.569 --> 07:49.240
I knew you were trouble
the second I laid eyes on you.

07:49.323 --> 07:53.869
Excuse me. I just have never
heard this kind of music before.

07:55.830 --> 07:58.500
Yakety-yak don't talk back

07:58.583 --> 08:03.213
take out the papers

08:03.296 --> 08:06.091
take... out... The... papers

08:06.133 --> 08:09.720
take out the papers
take out the papers

08:11.138 --> 08:13.515
take... out... The... papers

08:13.640 --> 08:16.101
and the trash trash

08:25.403 --> 08:27.780
LA-LA-LA LA-LA-LA

08:30.450 --> 08:33.119

09:44.151 --> 09:46.613
Hey, Vince!

09:46.697 --> 09:50.951
Listen, Al... You
gotta help me out.

09:51.034 --> 09:53.537
I'm into the klane
brothers for $20,000.

09:53.662 --> 09:56.873
- You borrowed money from a loan shark?
- What do you got?

09:56.998 --> 10:00.252
Got anything for me?
See what you got.

10:00.377 --> 10:02.879
We're doing this
too often, Vince.

10:02.963 --> 10:05.048
I'll give you something.

10:05.090 --> 10:08.261
I got a nice BMW
up on 4, stall 20.

10:43.380 --> 10:46.425
Vince, I'll take all
of these you can get.

10:46.467 --> 10:49.304
All right, Tony.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.765
- For you.
- Thanks, Tony.

10:51.848 --> 10:53.767
Yeah.

10:53.808 --> 10:55.727
Whoa, Tony!

10:55.852 --> 11:00.315
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.109
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

11:03.193 --> 11:05.945
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

11:06.029 --> 11:08.281
No, I just could've
used some more.

11:08.365 --> 11:10.951
- You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
- Yeah.

11:10.993 --> 11:13.412
Your bowels troubling you?

11:22.922 --> 11:25.508
What an amazing country.

11:26.509 --> 11:28.386
Hey.

11:28.469 --> 11:30.346
Gotta light, pal?

11:30.471 --> 11:34.476
Oh, excuse me.
I don't smoke, pal.

11:34.559 --> 11:36.603
Yeah. Ha-ha.

11:36.686 --> 11:39.523
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

11:39.648 --> 11:43.276
- Pickin' up something for the girlfriend?
- I don't have a girlfriend.

11:43.318 --> 11:45.779
Do women really
wear those things?

11:45.821 --> 11:47.739
If you're lucky, they do.

11:47.823 --> 11:49.783
I can't believe it.

11:49.825 --> 11:51.910
- You're from out of town?
- Yes.

11:52.035 --> 11:56.082
As a matter of fact, I come from
an island in the South pacific.

11:56.165 --> 11:58.710
Whoa!

12:01.045 --> 12:03.673
What the hell did
you do to him, man!

12:03.798 --> 12:07.677
I did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.681
Let me check him out.
A light concussion.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.516
Uh-oh.

12:13.599 --> 12:15.853
- I carry him to a hospital.
- No!

12:15.936 --> 12:18.272
I think you should
just take off, man.

12:18.355 --> 12:20.357
Find your horse you came in on.

12:20.399 --> 12:22.317
I'm so sorry about this.

12:22.401 --> 12:25.404
- I feel terrible.
- Me, too. Thanks a lot.

12:25.487 --> 12:27.531
- Sorry.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

12:27.573 --> 12:31.201
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

12:31.326 --> 12:33.370
Yeah, have a nice day.

12:33.412 --> 12:36.582
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

12:36.707 --> 12:40.336
These are quality socks.

12:40.378 --> 12:43.840
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

12:43.882 --> 12:46.051
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

12:46.134 --> 12:50.221
$53! Are you out of your mind?

12:50.305 --> 12:53.725
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.061
So, do I look normal to you?

12:56.186 --> 12:58.396
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

12:58.438 --> 13:01.567
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.652
Handicapped, my ass!

13:03.736 --> 13:06.530
I'll need your
driver's license, sir.

13:06.572 --> 13:09.158
Look, I'm sorry
I lost my temper.

13:09.241 --> 13:11.202
Driver's license, please.

13:11.285 --> 13:14.121
- Look, I had a very bad day.
- Driver's license... please.

13:14.246 --> 13:17.917
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr Benedict.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.171
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

13:21.254 --> 13:23.256
Happy Birthday. Watch your head.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.384
Thanks.

13:32.182 --> 13:34.142
Come along, now.

13:34.267 --> 13:36.770
So this is where
my brother grew up.

13:36.812 --> 13:40.607
I'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

13:44.946 --> 13:47.448
And that's where
he must have slept!

13:48.241 --> 13:50.159
Yes, it was.

13:50.243 --> 13:52.120
How did you know?

13:52.245 --> 13:55.289
It's the one I'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

13:55.373 --> 13:57.291
In case of a fire...

13:57.333 --> 14:00.795
I could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

14:02.088 --> 14:05.300
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

14:05.342 --> 14:08.637
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.727
Tell me a little bit
about Vincent.

14:14.810 --> 14:17.646
Was he a great athlete?
Interested in chess and poetry?

14:17.688 --> 14:20.482
I'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict...

14:20.566 --> 14:23.318
But it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

14:23.402 --> 14:25.447
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:27.240 --> 14:30.452
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

14:32.078 --> 14:34.330
That is Vince?

14:34.414 --> 14:36.374
He looks so happy.

14:36.499 --> 14:39.335
He should.
That's sister Maria...

14:39.461 --> 14:42.005
- His biology teacher.
- I always liked biology.

14:42.130 --> 14:44.007
So did Vincent.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.469
He disgraced sister Maria...

14:46.552 --> 14:48.512
Who had to leave the order.

14:48.637 --> 14:52.349
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.351
I must find my brother.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.896
Do you know where he might be?

14:56.979 --> 14:59.857
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

14:59.899 --> 15:04.070
You're full of goodness, Julius.
I pray you never find him.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.660
Benedict, visitor.

16:00.129 --> 16:03.424
- I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
- You got him.

16:31.119 --> 16:33.621
I have rowed halfway
across the world-

16:33.663 --> 16:35.791
wrong, I just rowed a day-

16:39.128 --> 16:43.299
I've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.843
I've been on my island,
I'm telling you.

16:45.968 --> 16:48.929
This is incredible that-
I have looked for-

16:57.355 --> 17:00.358
you've gotta talk
into the phone, bozo.

17:01.985 --> 17:04.863
Vincent. Dearest, Vincent...

17:04.945 --> 17:07.324
I know you don't know who I am.

17:07.406 --> 17:09.992
- But believe me, I came-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:10.077 --> 17:12.662
I've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

17:12.704 --> 17:15.874
Tell the klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

17:15.999 --> 17:18.211
Is beneath even them, all right?

17:18.336 --> 17:21.506
I don't know any klane brothers.
I'm your brother, Julius.

17:22.799 --> 17:25.675
Huh? Come again?

17:25.801 --> 17:29.347
My name is Julius,
and I'm your twin brother.

17:31.265 --> 17:33.184
Oh, obviously.

17:33.226 --> 17:38.147
The moment I sat down, I thought
I was looking into a mirror.

17:38.272 --> 17:40.734
We are not identical twins.

17:40.818 --> 17:42.861
- Oh, no?
- No.

17:42.986 --> 17:44.696
I wouldn't be too sure, pal.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.698
I don't lie. I am your brother.

17:46.782 --> 17:49.201
You must let me help
you get out of here.

17:49.284 --> 17:51.703
You want to help me get out?

17:51.829 --> 17:53.330
Yes, right now.

17:53.372 --> 17:57.251
Well, money talks,
and bullshit walks.

18:01.297 --> 18:04.092
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

18:04.217 --> 18:05.844
Yeah.

18:05.969 --> 18:07.804
I'm in fast company here.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.432
Take a look over there.
See that man?

18:10.557 --> 18:13.643
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

18:13.727 --> 18:16.187
I'll be anything you want,
your aunt, Uncle, sister...

18:16.229 --> 18:18.189
Your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

18:18.273 --> 18:21.568
- All right?
- Okay, I pay right now.

18:21.651 --> 18:23.237
- You pay now.
- Okay, Vince.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.364
Okay. Go pay.

18:25.489 --> 18:27.408
All right, pay him.

18:29.452 --> 18:32.079
What is this, "candid camera"?

18:33.581 --> 18:35.833
Ahhh, oof!

18:37.585 --> 18:41.213
Twinny, I hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets...

18:41.255 --> 18:45.093
Because I'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

18:45.177 --> 18:47.137
- I have more money.
- You do?

18:47.262 --> 18:50.348
I'm glad to help you.
Vincent, I'm your brother.

18:50.432 --> 18:52.642
- I love you.
- Whoa!

18:52.768 --> 18:55.771
Look, ease up
on the love talk...

18:55.854 --> 18:58.899
Because I'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

18:58.982 --> 19:01.109
Tossing your cookies?

19:01.193 --> 19:03.111
Oh, that's more slang!

19:03.195 --> 19:05.615
Where the hell is it?

19:07.200 --> 19:11.287
- This is your car, isn't it?
- Yeah, that's it.

19:11.370 --> 19:13.956
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

19:13.998 --> 19:17.126
- How'd you know this was my car?
- We're twins!

19:17.251 --> 19:20.755
I'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together...

19:20.880 --> 19:23.800
Talk philosophy together,
read books together.

19:23.841 --> 19:26.302
- Play chess together.
- Get lost together.

19:30.307 --> 19:32.184
Vincent!

19:36.480 --> 19:38.982
He's so full of energy.

19:43.487 --> 19:45.364
Blue sedan deville.

19:45.447 --> 19:47.991
This is beautiful.

19:48.075 --> 19:49.953
Where you guys going,
out to Hawaii?

19:49.994 --> 19:53.164
- Catch some of them big waves?
- Yeah, something like that.

19:53.206 --> 19:55.250
We have plenty
of room on level 4.

20:42.049 --> 20:44.551
I'll call you next Saturday.

20:44.593 --> 20:47.012
Whoa, where you going
with my desk?

20:47.095 --> 20:49.056
Takin' back this furniture, man.

20:49.139 --> 20:52.392
- You're six months behind.
- You're behind!

20:53.728 --> 20:55.897
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.316
There's no trust
in the world any more.

20:58.399 --> 21:00.943
I tried to stop them,
Mr Benedict.

21:01.069 --> 21:03.071
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

21:05.406 --> 21:07.450
Vincent Benedict incorporated.

21:07.575 --> 21:09.577
- Sports agent...
- Airborne!

21:10.578 --> 21:13.915
- Mr Benedict?
- Yeah?

21:13.998 --> 21:16.919
- It's Al.
- It's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

21:17.002 --> 21:21.757
Look, miss busby, uh-
Al, hang on a second.

21:21.882 --> 21:24.927
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

21:25.010 --> 21:29.139
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, I'll call you.

21:29.264 --> 21:31.600
Whatever you think is best.

21:31.725 --> 21:33.727
- All right.
- I'll take this.

21:33.811 --> 21:35.729
Yeah, go ahead. Take that.

21:35.771 --> 21:38.942
Before I forget, Happy Birthday.

21:41.444 --> 21:44.322
Oh, how sweet.

21:44.406 --> 21:46.449
That's very, very nice of you.

21:46.491 --> 21:50.495
- Aqua velva?
- Mm-hmm.

21:50.620 --> 21:54.499
You shouldn't have. Stacey.

21:56.543 --> 21:58.462
I'll give you a call, okay?

21:58.546 --> 22:01.132
All right, all right.

22:01.173 --> 22:03.426
Al, save me!

22:03.467 --> 22:06.345
Brand-new caddy on level 4.

22:06.721 --> 22:09.473
I'll be there! Don't move! Bye.

22:13.894 --> 22:15.813
Whoa!

22:19.776 --> 22:21.570
Time's up, Vincent.

22:29.244 --> 22:32.330
Did you hit me?
Because I didn't feel a thing.

22:33.331 --> 22:35.208
I felt that.

22:35.333 --> 22:39.004
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

22:39.129 --> 22:41.006
I like my work.

22:43.009 --> 22:45.845
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

22:45.887 --> 22:48.014
I don't know
what the problem is...

22:48.097 --> 22:50.266
But I'm sure it
can be resolved...

22:50.349 --> 22:52.602
- Without resorting to violence.
- Yeah.

22:52.727 --> 22:54.353
Okay?

22:54.437 --> 22:56.814
Okay.

23:01.152 --> 23:03.197
- You moved too soon.
- He did?

23:03.280 --> 23:04.364
Ahhh!

23:05.949 --> 23:08.368
A little chest pain?

23:08.452 --> 23:11.872
The first rule
in a crisis situation:

23:11.914 --> 23:15.209
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

23:15.334 --> 23:17.211
You negotiate first,
then you attack.

23:17.336 --> 23:19.213
- You never negotiated.
- Na-hah!

23:19.338 --> 23:21.256
You don't know what
kind of an enemy I am.

23:21.340 --> 23:25.053
- Who are you?
- I'm Vincent's brother.

23:25.136 --> 23:27.222
- We're twins.
- That's right.

23:28.681 --> 23:30.725
- You're firewood!
- Axe, axe, axe!

23:32.227 --> 23:34.979
You have no respect for logic.

23:35.105 --> 23:37.524
- But he's got an axe!
- Ahhhh!

23:41.444 --> 23:44.781
And I have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

23:46.909 --> 23:49.787
You're a very stupid person.

23:53.249 --> 23:55.543
You tell your brother...

23:55.626 --> 23:58.838
He messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

24:03.426 --> 24:05.928
I love it when you
hit people, Julius.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.263
Boom!

24:08.098 --> 24:09.975
That was great!

24:10.100 --> 24:11.977
Actually, I hate violence.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.979
But you're so good at it!

24:14.104 --> 24:16.356
I've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

24:16.440 --> 24:18.775
You could be a boxer.
I could be your manager.

24:18.900 --> 24:22.320
- I don't think I could fight for money.
- No problem!

24:22.404 --> 24:25.782
You do all the fighting,
I'll keep all the money.

24:25.866 --> 24:28.410
I'm really worried
about you, Vincent.

24:29.912 --> 24:32.290
How much money do you owe?

24:32.415 --> 24:35.334
Don't lie to me. We're twins.

24:35.418 --> 24:39.297
- I can feel your pain.
- Why do you keep saying that?

24:39.422 --> 24:41.382
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

24:41.466 --> 24:43.342
We're nothin'!

24:48.306 --> 24:50.058
Twenty thousand.

24:51.477 --> 24:53.645
Due this morning.

24:59.610 --> 25:01.487
Come on.

25:11.830 --> 25:14.167
Don't worry about
anything, Vincent.

25:14.292 --> 25:18.046
As long as I'm with you,
I won't let anyone harm you, okay?

25:20.673 --> 25:25.095
Well, you're a good guy, Julius.

25:25.178 --> 25:27.597
Now, hang on to your seat!

25:38.067 --> 25:40.528
You know what?
I completely forgot.

25:40.611 --> 25:43.155
I promised this friend, Sammy...

25:43.197 --> 25:45.491
That I'd pick his car up
from the airport.

25:45.574 --> 25:47.451
Put it in the slot.

25:47.535 --> 25:49.662
Would you do me a big favour?

25:49.703 --> 25:52.915
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

25:52.998 --> 25:54.875
Oh, I would love to.

25:55.000 --> 25:57.129
Good, that would
really be a big help.

25:57.212 --> 26:00.715
Do you have a manual, please?

26:02.175 --> 26:04.219
- A manual?
- Yeah.

26:05.720 --> 26:08.598
- It's in the glove compartment.
- Oh, yeah.

26:08.723 --> 26:10.809
There it is.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.112
- What are you doin' with the finger?
- Learning to drive.

26:21.237 --> 26:22.947
Whoa!

26:24.073 --> 26:25.908
It's not up here.

26:25.992 --> 26:28.327
Maybe it's under the back tyre.

26:28.411 --> 26:32.832
Look... I mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tyre.

26:32.915 --> 26:34.584
- Geez!
- What's the matter?

26:34.667 --> 26:38.296
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.299
No. Oh, well.

26:40.424 --> 26:44.261
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

26:44.386 --> 26:46.430
Handicapped children?

26:46.555 --> 26:49.975
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

26:50.100 --> 26:52.561
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

26:52.603 --> 26:54.855
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

26:56.815 --> 26:59.068
Do you really think
we should do that?

26:59.109 --> 27:00.779
It's for children.

27:02.947 --> 27:04.991
You got a point.

27:07.494 --> 27:11.039
I saw a guy from
the auto club do this once.

27:11.122 --> 27:13.750
What do you know,
beginners luck!

27:16.127 --> 27:18.963
These cars have terrific alarms!

27:19.089 --> 27:21.466
I'll get it in a minute.

27:22.843 --> 27:24.970
Just a second, Jules.

27:26.597 --> 27:27.973
Whoa!

27:29.100 --> 27:30.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:40.986 --> 27:45.283
If you lift the rear end
at an angle greater than 45%...

27:45.367 --> 27:48.286
The Mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system...

27:48.370 --> 27:50.705
So that the alarm's
computer thinks...

27:50.831 --> 27:53.125
That the car is being
towed and shuts off.

27:54.668 --> 27:57.212
Can I have the keys to your car?

27:58.797 --> 28:01.341
You know, the keys to your car?

28:01.383 --> 28:04.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No yodelling.

28:07.306 --> 28:09.183
Lovely day.

28:10.852 --> 28:12.645
Come on, Julius.

28:26.368 --> 28:29.288
Step on it!

28:30.831 --> 28:32.541
Yeeeoow!

28:45.053 --> 28:46.972
Oh, my God!

28:47.097 --> 28:50.393
- I am amazed at how well it's going.
- You're doing good.

28:50.477 --> 28:53.062
Don't use both feet
at the same time.

28:53.188 --> 28:57.108
- Just use the gas.
- Okay, one foot.

28:57.233 --> 28:59.194
- One pedal at a time.
- Okay! I will do it!

29:18.923 --> 29:21.300
Pick up the phone, the phone.

29:21.383 --> 29:24.261
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

29:30.684 --> 29:33.605
This is Vincent's car.
Can I help you, please?

29:33.730 --> 29:36.316
- Julius!
- Vincent, where are you?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.985
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

29:39.111 --> 29:42.114
That's me.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.990
Hello, yeah. Hello!

29:45.867 --> 29:47.536
What are you doing back there?

29:47.619 --> 29:51.665
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

29:51.748 --> 29:54.961
- Supermarket.
- Take your foot off the gas.

29:55.086 --> 29:58.464
Apply it to the brake.
It's the thing next to the gas.

29:58.589 --> 29:59.589
The brake pedal.

29:59.632 --> 30:01.801
- Very gently.
- You got it.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.179
Bye, Vincent.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.432
All right.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.813
Okay, it's a supermarket.

30:21.613 --> 30:23.699
Ohhh!

30:24.324 --> 30:25.743
Ohhh!

30:37.130 --> 30:39.632
That's what I call fun.

30:39.716 --> 30:41.843
Did you see me
with the two wheels?

30:41.885 --> 30:44.471
I can teach you that, Vincent.

30:44.554 --> 30:47.015
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

30:47.140 --> 30:50.268
Nobody likes
a smart ass, all right?

30:50.518 --> 30:52.353
So, what do you think?

30:52.395 --> 30:54.481
Angel's food or devil's food?

30:54.522 --> 30:56.441
Devil's.

30:56.524 --> 30:59.028
- You know what I really love about Vince?
- What?

30:59.153 --> 31:01.864
He's a force of nature.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.741
- You're outta control.
- No, I'm not.

31:03.866 --> 31:06.619
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

31:06.702 --> 31:09.580
I know. Geez,
you think I don't know that!

31:09.705 --> 31:11.665
- I don't think you know that.
- Well, I do.

31:11.707 --> 31:15.503
It's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

31:15.586 --> 31:19.049
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

31:19.091 --> 31:24.054
- Vince has a truly romantic soul.
- I can't hear this any more.

31:24.137 --> 31:27.099
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like I have...

31:27.224 --> 31:29.601
You'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

31:29.726 --> 31:31.728
And you'd get laid.

31:45.910 --> 31:48.204
- Ah!
- Excuse me.

31:48.246 --> 31:51.040
Excuse me.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.293
She's not bad.

31:54.419 --> 31:58.005
I had no idea
that these magazines...

31:58.089 --> 32:02.386
Had things like
this inside, inside them.

32:02.428 --> 32:05.264
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

32:05.389 --> 32:09.309
I come from a tropical island
in the South pacific.

32:09.435 --> 32:12.980
It's around 300 nautical Miles,
South, southwest of Fiji.

32:14.773 --> 32:17.734
I just got here yesterday
and I already found my brother.

32:17.776 --> 32:19.445
Your brother?

32:19.528 --> 32:21.530
That's right.

32:21.613 --> 32:23.658
My twin brother, Vincent.

32:23.783 --> 32:26.953
- Twins?
- Vince!

32:27.078 --> 32:29.956
- Linda.
- Hi.

32:29.998 --> 32:32.876
Oh, you look gorgeous
in this light.

32:32.959 --> 32:35.003
- You do.
- Really?

32:40.216 --> 32:42.677
Hi. Who's this guy?

32:42.802 --> 32:44.679
This is Vincent's brother.

32:44.804 --> 32:48.142
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- Me, either.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.060
You know each other?

32:50.144 --> 32:52.688
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

32:52.813 --> 32:56.650
- This is Linda.
- Hi.

32:56.734 --> 32:59.528
- Hello.
- Her charming sister, marnie.

33:02.323 --> 33:04.742
Sisters?

33:04.825 --> 33:06.995
Twins?

33:07.079 --> 33:09.623
Are you sure
this guy's all right?

33:09.664 --> 33:12.209
He's okay. He's helping me out.

33:12.334 --> 33:15.504
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

33:15.629 --> 33:18.507
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

33:18.590 --> 33:21.301
Catch ya later.

33:21.343 --> 33:24.346
Great seeing ya. Catch ya later.

33:24.429 --> 33:26.348
Oops!

33:28.976 --> 33:32.939
I've only been driving an hour.

33:34.857 --> 33:38.694
- Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
- Yeah, kinda.

33:38.820 --> 33:42.073
- Is marnie your girlfriend, too?
- Marnie?

33:42.156 --> 33:45.868
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

33:45.952 --> 33:48.204
- Me?
- Yeah.

33:48.329 --> 33:52.042
- She hardly knows me.
- That's the best way.

33:52.167 --> 33:54.586
You see, women love men...

33:54.711 --> 33:57.047
Who are mysterious and devious.

33:57.089 --> 33:59.091
Keeps them on their toes.

33:59.174 --> 34:02.386
- It excites them. You know what I mean?
- No.

34:02.469 --> 34:05.139
- You do like women?
- Very much so.

34:05.222 --> 34:07.141
They're strange and sensitive.

34:07.266 --> 34:09.601
They have compassion.

34:09.726 --> 34:12.730
I have the highest
respect for women.

34:16.568 --> 34:19.279
You're a virgin!

34:22.574 --> 34:25.326
That's private.

34:26.995 --> 34:29.748
A 230-pound virgin.

34:29.789 --> 34:32.917
It's all right. It's something-

34:33.042 --> 34:35.838
it's just one of those things.

34:35.920 --> 34:39.467
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

34:40.926 --> 34:44.304
Such a baby cat.
Look, did I neglect you?

34:44.429 --> 34:46.724
Not any more. Come on.

34:46.766 --> 34:49.893
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

34:49.935 --> 34:52.062
Okay, here you go.

34:52.146 --> 34:54.523
You named your cat Julius?

34:59.988 --> 35:04.868
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

35:04.951 --> 35:07.704
- There we go.
- That much cheese?

35:07.788 --> 35:10.082
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

35:10.165 --> 35:12.125
There you go.

35:12.167 --> 35:16.339
I know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

35:16.464 --> 35:20.134
And spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland...

35:20.259 --> 35:22.804
We just nuke it.

35:22.845 --> 35:26.307
That's it. Here we go.

35:26.432 --> 35:31.187
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

35:31.270 --> 35:34.690
- Yummy.
- Yeah.

35:48.789 --> 35:50.749
- Ahhh!
- Ahhh!

35:50.833 --> 35:53.043
Through the lips, over the gums,
look out-

35:53.168 --> 35:56.505
look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

35:56.630 --> 35:59.299
- Julius!
- Oh, I like nuked food.

35:59.341 --> 36:02.262
- Mm-mmm!
- Mmm!

36:26.996 --> 36:29.123
Now let me get this straight.

36:29.206 --> 36:31.709
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

36:31.792 --> 36:33.711
- Yes!
- And another one was...

36:33.753 --> 36:37.631
- A physicist at M.I.T.?
- Yes, he won the nobei prize.

36:37.715 --> 36:41.051
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

36:41.135 --> 36:46.266
And mom... Was like...
superwoman.

36:47.601 --> 36:51.688
But she didn't survive
the delivery.

36:51.813 --> 36:54.399
And I was sent
to an orphanage...

36:54.483 --> 36:57.110
While you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

36:57.235 --> 36:59.946
By a scientist who
you do research for...

37:00.030 --> 37:03.033
But who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

37:03.116 --> 37:05.453
Did I leave anything out?

37:05.578 --> 37:09.457
I think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

37:09.582 --> 37:12.335
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

37:12.418 --> 37:14.670
To the sperm milk shake.

37:14.754 --> 37:17.173
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

37:17.256 --> 37:20.134
Do you know how many times
I've heard stories like this?

37:20.259 --> 37:22.929
It's every orphan's fantasy.

37:23.012 --> 37:25.473
My real mom and dad were rich...

37:25.598 --> 37:27.476
And beautiful.

37:27.601 --> 37:30.354
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

37:30.437 --> 37:33.315
And I got switched
with another baby.

37:33.440 --> 37:36.068
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

37:36.110 --> 37:38.153
And there they'll be...

37:38.278 --> 37:42.825
With open arms, crying,
"my darling.

37:42.950 --> 37:46.161
"My treasure. We didn't know.

37:46.286 --> 37:48.456
How can we make it up to you?"

37:48.581 --> 37:51.126
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

37:51.209 --> 37:53.211
It's a crock.

37:55.713 --> 37:59.050
I liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

38:00.844 --> 38:03.930
Here it is. Read it and weep.

38:03.972 --> 38:07.434
"Dear sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

38:07.517 --> 38:10.479
- "For Vincent Benedict has been denied."
- Denied, yeah.

38:10.604 --> 38:14.817
"According to our files,
his mother did not die...

38:14.942 --> 38:16.819
- "During birth."
- She's not dead.

38:16.902 --> 38:19.321
"We have a current
address for her at...

38:19.405 --> 38:21.490
"172 canyon Glen drive,
Los Angeles.

38:21.574 --> 38:24.368
"Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment...

38:24.493 --> 38:27.329
And as such,
he's ineligible for aid."

38:27.455 --> 38:30.917
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

38:34.963 --> 38:37.299
This letter was written
30 years ago.

38:37.340 --> 38:39.760
We were five years old.

38:39.843 --> 38:41.970
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

38:42.012 --> 38:44.556
You knew all this time
where she was...

38:44.681 --> 38:46.850
And you never contacted her?

38:46.933 --> 38:51.396
I don't know about your mother,
"miss perfect, 1952"...

38:51.521 --> 38:54.734
But my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive...

38:54.859 --> 38:56.861
I hope she's in a lot of pain.

38:56.903 --> 38:58.821
She dumped me once.

38:58.946 --> 39:01.491
There is no way I'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

39:01.574 --> 39:04.452
If they have lied to us about mama
for all these years...

39:04.535 --> 39:07.705
Maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

39:07.789 --> 39:10.541
- We have to check this address.
- You do what you want.

39:10.625 --> 39:12.627
I got a cash-flow problem.

39:12.752 --> 39:14.564
Hello.

39:14.588 --> 39:16.423
Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

39:16.548 --> 39:18.926
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

39:19.051 --> 39:21.345
Or else what, you blimp?

39:32.856 --> 39:34.983
Oh, we're rollin'.

39:35.067 --> 39:37.904
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

39:38.029 --> 39:39.906
- Mr Garfield, there's a man-
- Not now.

39:46.913 --> 39:50.250
- Who are you?
- I'm Webster.

39:52.377 --> 39:53.875
It's okay!

39:53.899 --> 39:55.421
Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

39:55.547 --> 39:57.675
We were never supposed to meet.

39:57.758 --> 40:01.053
- You're supposed to be-
- Driving that car down to Texas.

40:01.095 --> 40:04.598
I got my driving gloves.
I got my driving glasses.

40:04.640 --> 40:06.600
I got my driving hat.

40:06.684 --> 40:09.145
But I got no car.

40:09.270 --> 40:12.106
The car was there.
The merchandise was in the trunk.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.275
Your instructions
were on the cassette.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.153
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

40:17.236 --> 40:20.949
- He wants more money.
- Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

40:20.991 --> 40:22.451
Sit down.

40:24.453 --> 40:27.372
I got a reputation to uphold.

40:27.456 --> 40:30.083
People put their trust in me.

40:30.208 --> 40:32.169
They know I always
deliver the goods...

40:32.294 --> 40:34.629
And I always come
back with the money.

40:34.754 --> 40:37.424
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

40:37.549 --> 40:40.970
- This is bullshit. The car was there.
- That's right.

40:41.095 --> 40:43.681
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

40:43.806 --> 40:46.184
- The parking attendant?
- He liked the car.

40:46.309 --> 40:48.770
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

40:48.895 --> 40:52.440
You know,
I just realized that...

40:52.482 --> 40:55.485
In over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

40:55.568 --> 40:57.445
Has ever seen my face.

40:57.487 --> 41:00.323
I don't think that's
a problem. Hey!

41:01.324 --> 41:03.869
No, please, please!

41:23.348 --> 41:26.226
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.663
Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?

41:28.687 --> 41:31.022
Grandpa...

41:31.064 --> 41:33.399
This man wants to talk to you.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.569
Thank you.

41:39.447 --> 41:41.366
Hello?

41:41.491 --> 41:43.409
Yes, can I help you?

41:43.535 --> 41:45.579
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.623
I know this may sound strange...

41:47.706 --> 41:51.043
But I'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

41:51.127 --> 41:54.088
Mary Ann Benedict.

41:59.552 --> 42:01.887
She was my mother.

42:05.724 --> 42:08.145
You're Mary Ann's son?

42:08.228 --> 42:13.066
That looks just
like you, grandpa.

42:13.150 --> 42:15.360
Honey, why don't
you go inside...

42:15.444 --> 42:18.363
And help grandma
with lunch, okay?

42:30.668 --> 42:32.712
Dad?

42:32.753 --> 42:35.715
Uh... no!

42:35.798 --> 42:39.927
- But maybe technically speaking.
- Dad!

42:40.052 --> 42:42.138
Dad!

42:42.221 --> 42:44.515
- Wait a minute!
- Dad! It is you!

42:44.640 --> 42:46.768
This is a big surprise.

42:46.809 --> 42:49.103
Dad, this is incredible.
I don't know what to-

42:49.145 --> 42:51.607
we could use a drink.
Where'd you come from?

42:51.648 --> 42:54.610
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

43:11.878 --> 43:15.548
Uh, Mr Webster,
I hope you are happy with the vehicle...

43:15.632 --> 43:19.135
We chose for
your little journey.

43:19.219 --> 43:23.306
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

43:23.348 --> 43:26.976
And ask for uh, uh,
beetroot McKinley.

43:27.060 --> 43:30.980
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

43:31.106 --> 43:33.025
Thank you.

43:33.150 --> 43:36.237
Mary Ann Benedict.

43:36.320 --> 43:40.908
I haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

43:40.991 --> 43:45.996
Your mother was...
An amazing woman.

43:46.122 --> 43:50.668
Oh, the times I've wondered what would
have happened if I'd have married her.

43:50.751 --> 43:53.045
Why didn't you?

43:53.129 --> 43:56.800
Oh, I asked her to.
She turned me down.

43:56.883 --> 44:00.595
She said she was afraid...

44:00.679 --> 44:03.181
To have any more children.

44:03.306 --> 44:06.309
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

44:06.351 --> 44:09.020
Who told her we died?

44:13.859 --> 44:16.112
Mitchell traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

44:16.195 --> 44:19.198
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

44:19.282 --> 44:23.661
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, new Mexico.

44:23.703 --> 44:26.038
I'll have to pay him a visit.

44:26.080 --> 44:28.374
Watch out for him.

44:28.458 --> 44:32.170
He's kind of a dickhead,
if you know what I mean.

44:32.253 --> 44:35.882
Dickhead?

44:35.965 --> 44:38.510
No, I don't.

44:38.635 --> 44:41.805
But... I'm learning.

44:47.060 --> 44:49.772
I'm concerned about the time frame.

44:49.897 --> 44:52.733
That's my private line, honey.
I'll take care of that.

44:52.816 --> 44:55.235
You boys, excuse me.

45:01.743 --> 45:04.037
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

45:06.039 --> 45:07.957
Uh, Webster.

45:08.041 --> 45:12.045
I'm callin' from California.
I happen to have something-

45:12.128 --> 45:15.715
some merchandise
that you might want.

45:15.757 --> 45:18.468
Well, bring it to me, son.

45:18.593 --> 45:20.596
Let me enrich you.

45:20.638 --> 45:22.973
Well, uh, Mr beetroot...

45:23.098 --> 45:25.309
It's the amount of enrichment...

45:25.434 --> 45:27.603
That I wanted to talk about.

45:27.686 --> 45:31.148
Don't try and renegotiate
with old beetroot, son.

45:31.273 --> 45:33.818
Now look, beetroot...

45:33.943 --> 45:37.113
If we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

45:37.196 --> 45:39.782
Look, there's no way,
Mr beetroot...

45:39.865 --> 45:43.620
That I am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

45:43.662 --> 45:48.291
Unless I know for sure
that I have...

45:48.333 --> 45:50.794
Twenty for my cut.

45:50.836 --> 45:53.964
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

45:54.089 --> 45:56.091
You're out of your
goddam, greedy mind!

45:56.174 --> 46:00.804
- I guess that seems a little high for you.
- Yeah!

46:02.389 --> 46:06.352
I'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

46:06.477 --> 46:10.982
- The deal is five!
- Five?

46:11.065 --> 46:13.234
I could do better
than five here.

46:15.111 --> 46:19.115
If you can do better
than five million dollars...

46:19.157 --> 46:22.660
Well, then, son, you take it.

46:36.925 --> 46:40.345
Beetroot,
I'll see you in Houston.

46:40.429 --> 46:42.598
After all, fair is fair.

46:42.681 --> 46:46.477
I'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

46:46.602 --> 46:49.856
Well, good.

46:59.824 --> 47:02.035
Five million!

47:02.118 --> 47:04.287
Five million dollars!

47:04.370 --> 47:06.581
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

47:06.706 --> 47:08.751
Five million dollars!

47:08.876 --> 47:12.213
Five, five million dollars!

47:12.254 --> 47:15.174
Five million dollars!

47:15.257 --> 47:18.511
Five m-m-million!

47:21.222 --> 47:23.599
Cash, lots of cash.

47:23.724 --> 47:25.893
Whoa!

47:26.018 --> 47:29.815
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

47:29.898 --> 47:33.902
- You scared the living shit outta me.
- I met one of our fathers.

47:33.985 --> 47:36.113
He told me about
a man in new Mexico...

47:36.238 --> 47:39.658
- Who probably knows where mom is.
- Oh, great! Yes!

47:39.741 --> 47:42.202
- Listen, she didn't abandon you.
- No?

47:42.244 --> 47:44.830
You know what I mean?
She didn't abandon you.

47:44.913 --> 47:46.915
- She didn't even know you were born.
- Oh!

47:47.040 --> 47:50.377
- They told her that I died.
- No kidding?

47:50.418 --> 47:53.131
Look, Julius, I'm in a hurry.

47:53.256 --> 47:56.592
- You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
- Yeah.

47:56.717 --> 47:59.887
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

47:59.971 --> 48:03.307
- So I'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
- Houston?

48:03.432 --> 48:07.436
Hous... hou-no! - You
know something?

48:07.520 --> 48:10.523
New Mexico's on
the way to Houston.

48:10.606 --> 48:14.778
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

48:14.862 --> 48:17.698
Use the house,
make some phone calls.

48:17.823 --> 48:20.784
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

48:20.868 --> 48:23.954
We have to see this man, traven,
in new Mexico.

48:23.996 --> 48:25.453
No, we don't have to see
this man in new Mexico.

48:25.477 --> 48:26.957
Yes, we do!

48:27.082 --> 48:30.878
And I'm coming with you.

48:35.967 --> 48:37.969
We'll go see the man.

48:38.052 --> 48:41.264
- I take a shower. I get my bags.
- Get your bags.

48:41.347 --> 48:43.683
Be right out. Oh, boy!

48:43.808 --> 48:46.978
I'll be here, bro. Okay.

48:54.819 --> 48:56.989
This place is a zoo!

48:57.072 --> 49:00.326
Wait, wait.

49:02.203 --> 49:04.830
- Happy Birthday, Vince.
- Oh.

49:04.914 --> 49:08.834
- Happy Birthday, Vince.
- God.

49:08.876 --> 49:10.833
It's not my birthday.
Better late than never.

49:10.857 --> 49:12.838
Oh.

49:12.880 --> 49:16.008
Look what marnie
made for Julius.

49:16.050 --> 49:18.929
- You baked?
- Yeah. Is Julius around?

49:19.012 --> 49:23.850
- He's taking a shower.
- I'll go give these to him.

49:23.934 --> 49:25.310
So-o-o!

49:25.435 --> 49:28.980
- Where'd you get this car?
- Sammy. You know Sammy.

49:29.022 --> 49:33.193
- Where you going?
- Inside. Have some coffee?

49:33.318 --> 49:37.364
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say goodbye.

49:37.405 --> 49:39.909
Take out your papers and your trash

49:40.034 --> 49:43.037
or you don't get
no spending cash

49:43.079 --> 49:45.957
if you don't scrub
the kitchen floor

49:46.040 --> 49:48.126
you ain't gonna
rock and roll no more

49:48.251 --> 49:50.837
yakety-yak yakety-yak
don't talk back

49:50.878 --> 49:52.505
Marnie!

49:53.923 --> 49:57.718
Excuse me, but I was
just taking a shower.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.720
Good singing.

49:59.804 --> 50:02.182
I baked you some cookies.

50:02.266 --> 50:05.185
- Cookies?
- I guess it was a dumb idea.

50:05.310 --> 50:09.565
No, not at all. I'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

50:13.569 --> 50:16.405
- I should put on some clothes.
- I'm sorry, I'll turn around.

50:16.488 --> 50:19.783
Linda and I just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

50:19.908 --> 50:22.745
- For his birthday.
- I had birthday, too.

50:22.829 --> 50:24.914
Oh, that's right.

50:24.998 --> 50:28.084
You're twins.

50:32.797 --> 50:34.883
Huh?

50:34.924 --> 50:36.926
Whoa.

50:36.968 --> 50:40.597
What is it?

50:40.680 --> 50:43.641
I don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

50:43.725 --> 50:46.270
- A fortune? That's great!
- Yeah!

50:46.353 --> 50:48.272
Excuse me!

50:49.607 --> 50:51.442
Excuse me.

50:51.484 --> 50:53.861
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money...

50:53.944 --> 50:58.115
Never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

50:58.157 --> 51:02.244
- Good morning, Agnes.
- Vince?

51:02.369 --> 51:05.582
I cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

51:05.707 --> 51:09.044
Vincent, I'm comin' with you.

51:09.127 --> 51:11.379
Linda, no,
you're not coming with me.

51:11.463 --> 51:13.590
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not coming.

51:13.673 --> 51:17.093
You could get killed and die and
I wouldn't know what happened.

51:17.177 --> 51:19.471
- No!
- You say "no" one more time...

51:19.596 --> 51:23.308
- I'm gonna tell everybody that there's-
- Shut up! Shut up!

51:27.188 --> 51:29.899
All right. Oh, God.

51:29.982 --> 51:32.151
All right, you're coming.

51:32.193 --> 51:36.405
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

51:36.489 --> 51:38.950
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

51:39.075 --> 51:41.285
Like in "roots" or something.
All right?

51:41.369 --> 51:43.496
- Does this one look okay?
- It looks fine.

51:43.621 --> 51:47.083
It's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

51:47.208 --> 51:50.671
- Marnie, guess what?
- Linda, what?

51:50.796 --> 51:53.799
Vince just asked us to go to new Mexico
and Texas with him.

51:53.841 --> 51:56.176
This is a great idea.

51:56.301 --> 51:58.092
Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?

51:58.116 --> 51:59.930
Yeah.

52:00.013 --> 52:03.350
I thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

52:03.475 --> 52:05.352
And spent a few days
on the road together.

52:05.477 --> 52:07.604
Nice shirt.

52:07.688 --> 52:12.861
- Feels great. It's all cotton.
- Well, it breathes.

52:14.320 --> 52:16.865
It's okay. Come out.

52:16.906 --> 52:19.701
All right. Here, Linda.

52:19.784 --> 52:23.204
Oh, can I ride
in front with Vincent?

52:23.288 --> 52:25.290
- Sure.
- Thanks.

52:41.223 --> 52:43.309
Now, let me see.

52:43.434 --> 52:45.895
I'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

52:45.978 --> 52:48.063
Sorry, it's my first day
on the job.

52:48.147 --> 52:50.900
Have a nice day.

52:53.987 --> 52:58.241
Now, where do I find
this very special person...

52:58.325 --> 53:01.953
Mr Vince Benedict?

53:30.525 --> 53:33.569
Well, what have we here?

53:33.611 --> 53:36.405
What a cute little kitty.

53:36.489 --> 53:38.617
Where's daddy?

53:48.043 --> 53:52.631
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

53:52.714 --> 53:54.758
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

53:54.800 --> 53:57.344
Come on, we just
wanna talk to you.

53:57.469 --> 54:00.473
Howdy!

54:01.975 --> 54:05.603
Who are you?

54:05.728 --> 54:07.647
It's not really
important, is it?

54:07.689 --> 54:09.732
I was just feeding the cat,
then I was gonna leave.

54:09.816 --> 54:11.651
I asked you a question.

54:11.734 --> 54:14.988
- Well, who are you?
- We're the klane brothers.

54:15.029 --> 54:17.157
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and I'm Bob.

54:17.240 --> 54:21.745
- Interesting gene pool.
- Don't cast dispersions.

54:21.829 --> 54:24.832
I beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

54:24.874 --> 54:27.042
- Right.
- Am I Vince Benedict?

54:28.461 --> 54:30.671
So what difference
does it make who I am?

54:30.713 --> 54:33.841
- Hit him, Bobby.
- Yeah.

54:33.883 --> 54:35.718
Hey! All right.

54:35.843 --> 54:37.845
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

54:37.887 --> 54:41.349
- Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
- Ow! Ow!

54:41.391 --> 54:46.480
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

54:49.357 --> 54:51.693
- You want a doctor?
- Ow!

54:51.818 --> 54:54.696
I'll call a doctor.

55:42.830 --> 55:46.543
Sorry I tore your shirt.
I don't know what happened.

55:46.668 --> 55:48.586
It's all right.

55:48.711 --> 55:50.588
- Julius!
- What?

55:50.672 --> 55:54.050
- Are you allergic to something?
- No.

55:54.134 --> 55:57.053
Then why are these bumps
all over your body?

55:57.137 --> 56:00.431
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

56:00.557 --> 56:04.435
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

56:04.519 --> 56:07.480
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

56:07.605 --> 56:11.277
- It's like north Dakota.
- You're so funny, Vincent.

56:13.362 --> 56:15.447
This is for the t-shirt
and the sandwiches.

56:17.908 --> 56:22.121
- Born to be bad.
- Yes, we are.

56:22.246 --> 56:24.498
Ooh, you're so scary.

56:24.623 --> 56:26.792
Linda.

56:26.876 --> 56:29.296
Linda!

56:29.421 --> 56:31.631
Well, what do you think?

56:31.756 --> 56:36.970
- Let's rock and roll.
- It's his first t-shirt.

56:55.406 --> 56:57.408
- Honey, honey.
- Yeah?

56:57.533 --> 57:00.995
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed?

57:01.120 --> 57:02.577
Right.

57:02.601 --> 57:04.081
We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

57:04.165 --> 57:07.877
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

57:08.002 --> 57:11.672
I don't need a king-size bed.
I always sleep on the floor.

57:11.964 --> 57:16.178
Uh, I don't know, Jules.
I hope this is a good idea.

57:16.303 --> 57:19.723
Come on.

57:19.848 --> 57:22.976
Now, look, promise me something.

57:23.018 --> 57:27.439
If this Professor traven
has never heard of...

57:27.523 --> 57:30.067
You know, mom or us twins...

57:30.192 --> 57:33.028
Or all our dads
or the experiment...

57:33.153 --> 57:35.323
You won't be upset.

57:35.365 --> 57:38.326
All I want him to do
is tell us the truth.

57:38.409 --> 57:41.246
I don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

57:41.371 --> 57:45.208
Get the hell out of here
before I call security.

57:45.333 --> 57:50.004
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

57:50.046 --> 57:51.962
He's lying!

57:51.986 --> 57:53.925
Take it easy. He said he
was gonna call security.

57:54.050 --> 57:57.596
For the first time in my life,
I'm pissed off!

57:57.721 --> 57:59.761
Julius, don't do this to me.
I got a car to deliver.

57:59.807 --> 58:02.101
The last thing I need is
a detour in the slammer.

58:02.226 --> 58:04.895
- I'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
- No!

58:07.898 --> 58:10.484
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

58:10.568 --> 58:13.529
That's Werner. And that is you.

58:13.571 --> 58:18.410
- So start talking.
- Everything okay, dr traven?

58:20.829 --> 58:23.290
Um, yes. It's okay.

58:23.415 --> 58:25.625
I'll take care of it.

58:28.920 --> 58:32.632
Well, Vincent...

58:34.426 --> 58:36.553
You turned out just like
I thought you would.

58:36.595 --> 58:38.597
What did you do,
escape from prison?

58:43.102 --> 58:45.813
How'd you know my name?

58:47.940 --> 58:49.859
I named you.

59:04.124 --> 59:08.128
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

59:23.812 --> 59:27.065
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

59:41.496 --> 59:45.084
You came out first, of course.

59:45.167 --> 59:48.754
We weren't expecting... Him.

59:50.172 --> 59:53.425
This, uh...

59:53.551 --> 59:55.886
Must be where you
made the milk shake.

59:56.011 --> 59:59.014
We weren't making milk shakes.

59:59.098 --> 01:00:02.893
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

01:00:03.018 --> 01:00:06.648
But instead of just
one perfect kid...

01:00:06.731 --> 01:00:11.069
- Mom had the two of us. Way to go, mom!
- Wrong!

01:00:11.194 --> 01:00:14.614
The embryo did split
in two, but...

01:00:14.739 --> 01:00:17.200
It didn't split equally.

01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:21.496
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

01:00:21.538 --> 01:00:23.540
All the crap
that was left over...

01:00:23.582 --> 01:00:26.209
Went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:28.254
Whoa. You telling me
I'm the crap?

01:00:28.379 --> 01:00:31.215
- This is not true.
- Wait, Julius.

01:00:31.299 --> 01:00:35.011
You're telling me that I am
the leftover crap? I'm no good?

01:00:35.136 --> 01:00:38.097
- He's wrong.
- Look at him.

01:00:40.558 --> 01:00:45.062
Are you saying that
I'm a side effect?

01:00:45.146 --> 01:00:48.192
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

01:00:48.275 --> 01:00:51.778
And I haven't got the time.
Show's over.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:57.242
Hey, dickhead.

01:00:57.326 --> 01:00:59.912
Tell us where our mother is.

01:01:00.037 --> 01:01:03.040
Um... whispering pines.

01:01:03.081 --> 01:01:06.585
It's an artists' colony
200 Miles north of Santa Fe.

01:01:10.757 --> 01:01:15.094
If you're lying to me,
I'll be back.

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:28.191
Come on.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.710
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

01:01:46.836 --> 01:01:51.507
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

01:01:51.632 --> 01:01:54.302
I'm genetic garbage.

01:01:54.427 --> 01:01:58.223
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

01:01:58.306 --> 01:02:02.102
Julius, I know this is
a touchy subject for you...

01:02:02.185 --> 01:02:04.813
But we don't look the same,
we don't act the same...

01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:06.478
We don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.

01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:08.066
I know.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:11.486
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?

01:02:11.611 --> 01:02:14.030
We had six fathers.

01:02:14.156 --> 01:02:16.951
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

01:02:17.034 --> 01:02:19.579
Yeah?

01:02:19.662 --> 01:02:23.708
Don't forget. I was taken
to a beautiful island.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:26.669
I was loved. I was
protected, educated.

01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:30.047
You had nobody, Vincent.

01:02:30.131 --> 01:02:33.801
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

01:02:33.885 --> 01:02:36.847
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

01:02:36.889 --> 01:02:39.975
Could count on was yourself.

01:02:45.355 --> 01:02:49.234
You see, Vincent...

01:02:49.359 --> 01:02:52.946
You're the missing part
of my life.

01:02:53.030 --> 01:02:56.116
And I'm the missing part
of your life.

01:02:56.200 --> 01:02:58.286
When we find mama...

01:02:58.369 --> 01:03:00.872
We can fill the
missing part of hers.

01:03:03.708 --> 01:03:06.669
We won't be alone any more.

01:03:06.753 --> 01:03:10.381
We can be a family.

01:03:15.887 --> 01:03:18.431
A family?

01:03:18.556 --> 01:03:20.476
Yes.

01:03:22.728 --> 01:03:25.397
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree...

01:03:25.481 --> 01:03:27.608
And Thanksgiving dinner?

01:03:27.733 --> 01:03:29.610
And a real home...

01:03:29.735 --> 01:03:34.073
Where you'll always be welcome.

01:03:34.156 --> 01:03:36.283
Always?

01:03:36.408 --> 01:03:40.412
Even when you've been bad.

01:03:47.587 --> 01:03:49.673
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:49.798 --> 01:03:51.758
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

01:03:51.883 --> 01:03:54.970
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

01:03:55.095 --> 01:03:58.265
- Is this really necessary?
- Yes, of course it's necessary.

01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:01.852
I'm not going to introduce you to my mother
looking like a goat herder from Albania.

01:04:01.935 --> 01:04:03.938
You need clothes.

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:06.774
- But I feel fine the way I am.
- But you look like a-

01:04:06.816 --> 01:04:10.111
- hello, can I help you?
- Do I look like I need help?

01:04:10.236 --> 01:04:13.239
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:28.005
- Do I look okay?
- You look better. Let's put it that way.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.090
You know what
we have to do, Jules?

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.467
We gotta work on the way
you're walking.

01:04:32.509 --> 01:04:36.221
You look a little stiff.
You ever see "Frankenstein"?

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:38.807
- I read the book.
- That's not gonna help.

01:04:38.891 --> 01:04:43.270
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music...

01:04:43.312 --> 01:04:45.272
And I don't mean
a military march.

01:04:45.355 --> 01:04:48.193
Like, you know, aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:50.862
And Wilson pickett,
a couple of white people.

01:04:50.945 --> 01:04:53.323
- Like this?
- Yeah. Bop! That's it.

01:04:53.448 --> 01:04:56.201
- Yeah, loose!
- Oh, I like that.

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.370
I got something for you.
Try these on.

01:04:59.496 --> 01:05:02.707
- Sunglasses?
- Yeah, here you go.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:08.255
Now, that's it. There. Yeah!

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:11.342
That's it. Yeah!

01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:13.344
- Whoops!
- Whoa!

01:05:13.427 --> 01:05:17.515
- Do I look cooi now?
- Mr lce.

01:05:17.598 --> 01:05:20.684
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah!

01:05:20.768 --> 01:05:24.355
Tonight

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.398
tonight's the night

01:05:26.524 --> 01:05:28.902
it's gonna be a good night, bro

01:05:29.027 --> 01:05:31.863
and everything's gonna
happen, bro

01:05:31.947 --> 01:05:34.074
and you take her in your arms

01:05:34.157 --> 01:05:36.743
and you plant a good
one on her... ho

01:05:36.868 --> 01:05:38.745
tonight's the night

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:40.747
tonight, tonight, tonight

01:05:40.872 --> 01:05:47.754
tonight is your night, bro

01:05:47.879 --> 01:05:50.258
yeah, it's your night, bro!

01:05:50.383 --> 01:05:52.343
Oh yeah, bro you're gonna do it

01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:54.470
you're gonna cut it

01:05:54.554 --> 01:05:56.722
you're making me nervous!

01:05:56.806 --> 01:05:59.058
- Well, you're nervous.
- You've got to help me.

01:05:59.141 --> 01:06:01.227
- What?
- I've never been out on a date before.

01:06:01.310 --> 01:06:03.479
- That's okay.
- I don't know what to do.

01:06:03.563 --> 01:06:06.941
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

01:06:07.066 --> 01:06:08.943
You dance with her, bro

01:06:09.026 --> 01:06:12.781
you gonna dance with

01:06:12.906 --> 01:06:14.700
you dance?

01:06:18.787 --> 01:06:20.932
Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.

01:06:20.956 --> 01:06:23.125
No.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.127
Oh, well, look.

01:06:25.252 --> 01:06:27.212
All right.

01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:30.215
The first thing is, Jules...

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.467
Forget about disco.

01:06:32.593 --> 01:06:35.430
- Right? No disco.
- No disco.

01:06:35.555 --> 01:06:39.058
When I really wanna
romance a girl...

01:06:39.142 --> 01:06:41.352
I waltz with her.

01:06:41.436 --> 01:06:45.023
Rah-tah-tah rah-tah-tah

01:06:45.106 --> 01:06:47.400
- you mean, like Strauss?
- Yeah.

01:06:47.483 --> 01:06:50.403
It turns 'em into
putty in your hands.

01:06:50.486 --> 01:06:52.739
Rump-bump-bum
diddilly-ump-bump

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:56.994
rump-bump-bum, rump-bump-bum
rump-bump-bum

01:06:57.119 --> 01:06:59.747
come on, let's assume
the dance position.

01:06:59.788 --> 01:07:01.916
I'll give you
a couple of pointers.

01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:04.126
- I really appreciate that.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:07:04.168 --> 01:07:06.337
I hope nobody's
looking in the window.

01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:08.380
Come on, like this. Here you go.

01:07:08.464 --> 01:07:12.134
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

01:07:13.219 --> 01:07:15.804
By my feet...

01:07:15.930 --> 01:07:18.058
Not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

01:07:18.141 --> 01:07:20.936
- Sorry, Vincent.
- Minor oversight.

01:07:20.977 --> 01:07:23.146
Grab my hand. Come on.

01:07:23.271 --> 01:07:26.525
Yeow! Ah! Ease up!

01:07:26.608 --> 01:07:28.482
Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.

01:07:28.506 --> 01:07:30.403
Oh, like loose?

01:07:30.487 --> 01:07:32.822
- See, come on. That's it, relax.
- I'm just nervous.

01:07:32.906 --> 01:07:36.201
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

01:07:36.326 --> 01:07:38.746
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.790
- One, two, three.
- Don't, no.

01:07:40.832 --> 01:07:42.917
- One, two, three.
- See what you're doing with your teeth?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.920
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

01:07:46.045 --> 01:07:48.673
Don't grind your teeth.

01:07:48.756 --> 01:07:51.050
Relax your jaws, yeah.

01:07:51.175 --> 01:07:55.096
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?

01:07:55.179 --> 01:07:58.724
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:01.353
See? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

01:08:01.436 --> 01:08:04.773
300 Miles South,
southwest of Fiji.

01:08:04.857 --> 01:08:10.445
If I die for this dance

01:08:10.571 --> 01:08:12.698
hold you and talk of

01:08:12.781 --> 01:08:15.868
romance

01:08:15.909 --> 01:08:18.412
I've never been lucky

01:08:18.537 --> 01:08:22.625
I've got to take a chance

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:27.921
I'm caught up
in some kind of trance

01:08:28.046 --> 01:08:33.011
and yes I would die
for this dance

01:08:35.971 --> 01:08:38.600
where did you come from

01:08:38.725 --> 01:08:41.060
out of nowhere it seems

01:08:41.185 --> 01:08:44.231
- may be an angel
- Good, Jules.

01:08:44.356 --> 01:08:47.359
Smiling on me

01:08:47.401 --> 01:08:49.403
I know it's crazy

01:08:49.444 --> 01:08:52.072
you've taken my heart

01:08:52.156 --> 01:08:54.533
I'll never leave you

01:08:54.617 --> 01:08:56.911
you're my missing part

01:08:57.036 --> 01:09:01.916
yes I'd die for this dance

01:09:01.999 --> 01:09:08.798
hold you and talk of romance

01:09:08.924 --> 01:09:14.720
I've never been lucky
I've got to take a chance

01:09:14.845 --> 01:09:17.933
yeah!

01:09:18.015 --> 01:09:21.728
I'm caught up in
some kind of trance

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:27.944
yes I would die for this dance

01:09:45.627 --> 01:09:47.631
way to go, Jules!

01:09:47.714 --> 01:09:49.675
Ahhh!

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.471
Did you know they had beer
in ancient Egypt?

01:09:54.555 --> 01:09:56.557
- Oh, yeah?
- No.

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:00.769
It was actually the assyrians
that developed the beer.

01:10:00.811 --> 01:10:04.690
The Egyptians were the first
to perfect the malt process.

01:10:04.815 --> 01:10:09.320
- You know a lot about beer.
- He knows about everything.

01:10:09.445 --> 01:10:11.990
It's all from books.
Until tonight, I've never had a beer.

01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:17.287
All theory, no practise.
The story of my life.

01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:22.000
- Awww!
- We're gonna change all that.

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:23.960
Aren't we, marnie?

01:10:25.253 --> 01:10:27.255
- Marnie.
- What?

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.799
Am I shit-faced yet?

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:36.557
Excuse me, but...
My back teeth are floating.

01:10:38.851 --> 01:10:43.314
Excuse me, I have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

01:10:43.355 --> 01:10:45.274
Good shot.

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:51.363
Woo-hoo! Ooo!

01:10:53.158 --> 01:10:57.829
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

01:10:59.539 --> 01:11:02.918
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo!

01:11:03.043 --> 01:11:06.087
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

01:11:06.213 --> 01:11:08.173
Tonight is your lucky night.
I know it.

01:11:08.215 --> 01:11:12.219
- I don't think marnie likes me.
- You kidding? Piece of cake.

01:11:12.344 --> 01:11:15.181
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

01:11:15.264 --> 01:11:17.642
Because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

01:11:20.102 --> 01:11:22.063
Really.

01:11:25.525 --> 01:11:28.569
Were you nervous the first time?

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:34.242
I was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

01:11:35.869 --> 01:11:37.746
Whoa!

01:11:37.871 --> 01:11:39.748
Come on, hit 'em.

01:11:39.873 --> 01:11:41.750
- What?
- Hit 'em, hit 'em.

01:11:41.875 --> 01:11:44.253
Oh, hit 'em, hit 'em.

01:11:44.294 --> 01:11:50.133
Julius... You know...

01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:53.887
Julius, I have to admit this.

01:11:53.929 --> 01:11:57.141
Since you and I first met, uh...

01:11:57.267 --> 01:11:59.602
My life has been just
getting better and better.

01:11:59.686 --> 01:12:03.022
Mine, too.

01:12:03.106 --> 01:12:05.024
I'm so happy, Vincent.

01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:07.485
I feel like sometimes, like...

01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:10.029
- Picking you up and hug you...
- Whoa!

01:12:10.113 --> 01:12:12.156
And hug you, hug you, hug you.

01:12:15.618 --> 01:12:17.495
Hey, he's my brother.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.708
Oh, lay off the beer, Julius.

01:12:29.967 --> 01:12:33.512
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe?

01:12:33.596 --> 01:12:36.390
I called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

01:12:38.559 --> 01:12:40.687
Oh, I forgot to tell you
we were fired.

01:12:40.812 --> 01:12:44.024
- Oh, no.
- You hated that job.

01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:45.543
Nice of your boss to tell
us where we could find you.

01:12:45.567 --> 01:12:46.985
Oh, no.

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:52.490
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

01:12:54.159 --> 01:12:59.164
The klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

01:12:59.289 --> 01:13:02.752
Vince, this has
gone way beyond...

01:13:02.835 --> 01:13:06.214
- A case of simple loan delinquency.
- We don't like being shot.

01:13:06.297 --> 01:13:09.383
Shot? Who shot you?

01:13:09.509 --> 01:13:11.969
- What do you want?
- We want to take Vince...

01:13:12.053 --> 01:13:15.848
- Out to the parking lot and kill him.
- Ohhh, owww!

01:13:15.932 --> 01:13:19.268
Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:21.020
Let's go.

01:13:21.145 --> 01:13:23.105
Don't touch him.

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:26.193
Ohhh!

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:29.196
Hey, big fella.

01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:31.657
You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?

01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:34.493
You moved too soon.

01:13:35.869 --> 01:13:39.748
- What?
- The second rule in a crisis:

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:42.584
Uh-oh. He's startin'
that funny talk, again.

01:13:44.044 --> 01:13:46.130
If you choose to bluff...

01:13:46.214 --> 01:13:48.216
You must be prepared
to have your bluff called.

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:51.177
This is no bluff.

01:13:51.219 --> 01:13:53.555
These are my cousins,
Sam and Dave.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.057
Get these jerks outta here.

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:14.410
I'm so proud of you.
I love when you hit people.

01:14:16.203 --> 01:14:18.664
You got a lot of rules, Jules.

01:14:27.381 --> 01:14:29.593
What a day.

01:14:29.718 --> 01:14:33.263
First we visited
our birthplace...

01:14:33.388 --> 01:14:35.432
Then we bought new clothes.

01:14:35.473 --> 01:14:39.227
I got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

01:14:39.269 --> 01:14:42.814
- Then we danced the waltz.
- Yes, we did.

01:14:42.939 --> 01:14:46.026
- It's too bright.
- Then we got into a fight.

01:14:46.109 --> 01:14:50.114
- We have this beautiful room.
- Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

01:14:50.198 --> 01:14:52.450
Life just doesn't
get better than this.

01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:56.621
- Oh, yes, it does. Good night.
- Where are you going?

01:14:56.746 --> 01:15:00.208
I'm gonna go tuck Linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.

01:15:00.333 --> 01:15:03.461
Don't wait up for me.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:08.925
Tonight is your night, bro

01:15:08.966 --> 01:15:10.927
it's your night, bro

01:15:14.515 --> 01:15:16.558
Oh, Vincent, you locked
yourself out.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:20.938
I- marnie.
- Hi.

01:15:20.979 --> 01:15:22.898
- Hi.
- Vince and Linda wanna be alone...

01:15:22.981 --> 01:15:26.235
So I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:30.697
You mean you're gonna sleep here tonight?
Uhhuh.

01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:33.785
Which bed should I take?

01:15:36.162 --> 01:15:38.498
Either bed will be fine.

01:15:38.623 --> 01:15:40.500
I always sleep on the floo-

01:15:50.051 --> 01:15:53.513
- good night.
- Good night.

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:09.905
Julius.

01:16:13.325 --> 01:16:16.955
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:35.932
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:41.063
- What's the matter?
- This bed is lumpy.

01:16:46.569 --> 01:16:49.780
You mind if I share
the floor with you?

01:17:17.267 --> 01:17:20.939
You're teasing me, aren't you?

01:17:21.022 --> 01:17:23.441
A little.

01:17:25.944 --> 01:17:30.365
What do I do now?

01:17:33.493 --> 01:17:35.453
We'll figure it out.

01:17:38.414 --> 01:17:41.459
- Oh, Vince.
- Tonight is our night, bro

01:17:41.584 --> 01:17:44.463
why are you doing that now?

01:17:44.505 --> 01:17:46.423
Mom hasn't seen me
in all these years.

01:17:46.549 --> 01:17:48.842
I wanna look my best.

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:52.137
Tonight - your mom's gonna
love you whatever you look like.

01:17:52.263 --> 01:17:54.139
And you look really good.

01:17:54.265 --> 01:17:56.642
I know, I know, I know, I know.

01:17:56.767 --> 01:18:00.855
So like this. One, two, three.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:02.857
Are you a little nervous?

01:18:02.982 --> 01:18:04.860
27, 28, no, 29.

01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:07.487
- Just a little.
- Nine, ten.

01:18:07.571 --> 01:18:09.489
- Linda.
- What?

01:18:09.614 --> 01:18:13.618
Like, what if she's
disappointed in me?

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.496
If she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.

01:18:16.621 --> 01:18:19.875
I don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.

01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:22.878
- Huh?
- You're right.

01:18:23.003 --> 01:18:25.882
You're right, you're right.
Why am I worried?

01:18:26.007 --> 01:18:27.884
- What am I worried about?
- I don't know.

01:18:27.967 --> 01:18:29.969
You got it all.

01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:35.558
- I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
- Yeah.

01:18:35.683 --> 01:18:38.394
You know, I've been thinking...

01:18:38.519 --> 01:18:42.023
- That when we get back...
- Yeah?

01:18:42.106 --> 01:18:44.358
I think we should
move in together.

01:18:44.442 --> 01:18:46.360
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:46.402 --> 01:18:48.739
- Oh, no, no.
- It's not "oh, no."

01:18:48.864 --> 01:18:50.866
- It's not no, no, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:50.949 --> 01:18:53.160
I don't want to get married
and it's not that I wanna...

01:18:53.285 --> 01:18:55.704
Keep track of you,
because I don't need to.

01:18:55.829 --> 01:18:59.208
I just wanna live with you.

01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.877
It'd be fun.

01:19:01.919 --> 01:19:05.005
Linda, look at me.

01:19:05.047 --> 01:19:07.049
Do I look like somebody
who could play house?

01:19:07.174 --> 01:19:10.178
I'm cranky in the morning,
I'm grouchy in the afternoon...

01:19:10.261 --> 01:19:12.680
I'm moody at night,
I'm like miserable.

01:19:12.764 --> 01:19:15.099
I know what you're like.

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:19.270
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Sleep on it.

01:19:19.395 --> 01:19:21.814
- Okay, one night.
- This is going to be great.

01:19:21.898 --> 01:19:25.610
Tomorrow I'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. I'm so excited.

01:19:25.735 --> 01:19:29.364
- Your best girl?
- Yeah, you, you.

01:19:29.405 --> 01:19:31.126
Linda, there's no other girls.
Not any more.

01:19:31.137 --> 01:19:32.868
Yeah?

01:19:32.952 --> 01:19:37.289
- Just you.
- There better not be. Know why?

01:19:37.373 --> 01:19:42.628
- Why?
- 'Cause I only have eyes for you

01:19:46.966 --> 01:19:48.926
- that sounds familiar.
- It's a good song.

01:19:49.051 --> 01:19:50.928
You like that song, huh?

01:19:51.011 --> 01:19:56.017
And I only have eyes

01:19:56.101 --> 01:20:03.108
for you she-bop she-bop

01:20:03.191 --> 01:20:05.110
she-bop she-bop

01:20:07.571 --> 01:20:09.114
she-bop she-bop

01:20:09.197 --> 01:20:15.997
I only have eyes for you
she-bop she-bop

01:20:17.373 --> 01:20:19.792
she-bop she-bop

01:20:19.876 --> 01:20:22.962
just for you
she-bop she-bop

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:38.186
oh, it's huge.

01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:40.188
Oh, it's beautiful.

01:20:40.314 --> 01:20:42.191
Not to mention valuable.

01:20:42.316 --> 01:20:44.693
Real estate like this
is worth a fortune.

01:20:44.776 --> 01:20:46.778
You mustn't always
think about money.

01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:49.072
You got me all wrong, Julius.

01:20:50.741 --> 01:20:53.702
I'm just saying
it's nice mom's loaded.

01:20:53.785 --> 01:20:57.248
That's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.

01:20:57.332 --> 01:20:59.209
Hello, can I help you?

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:02.003
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, um, excuse me.

01:21:02.128 --> 01:21:03.963
We are looking for
Mary Ann Benedict, please.

01:21:04.005 --> 01:21:06.507
I'm sorry, but
that's not possible.

01:21:06.591 --> 01:21:08.843
Look, we've come a long way.

01:21:08.968 --> 01:21:12.889
And believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.

01:21:13.014 --> 01:21:17.185
You're gonna have to write to the
Benedict foundation stating your business.

01:21:17.227 --> 01:21:19.230
I'm sorry. Good day.

01:21:23.943 --> 01:21:28.197
- Foundation?
- Millions, Julius.

01:21:28.322 --> 01:21:30.115
Mama's rich.
We gotta go see her.

01:21:30.199 --> 01:21:31.867
Buckaroos.

01:21:31.951 --> 01:21:34.370
- Let's get in there. We gotta talk to her.
- We sneak in.

01:21:34.411 --> 01:21:36.830
- How is it?
- Yeah, it's clear. Throw me over.

01:21:36.914 --> 01:21:38.874
Okay.

01:21:42.170 --> 01:21:45.048
Vince? Vince, are you okay?

01:21:45.173 --> 01:21:47.050
Yeah, shut up. Come on, come on.

01:22:10.867 --> 01:22:12.785
What a lovely day.

01:22:16.747 --> 01:22:21.085
Hey, Vincent, don't you
think this is mama?

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:25.632
It could be. Yeah.

01:22:25.757 --> 01:22:28.927
Don't just stand there.
Go introduce yourselves.

01:22:29.011 --> 01:22:30.262
Hey!

01:22:30.304 --> 01:22:33.807
- Should you people be here?
- Uh-oh.

01:22:33.932 --> 01:22:37.811
That depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.

01:22:37.936 --> 01:22:40.480
Does he always try
to be funny like that?

01:22:40.606 --> 01:22:44.569
- We're looking for miss Mary Ann Benedict.
- Yeah.

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:48.114
- Is she here?
- Yeah, she's here.

01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:50.658
She's here!

01:22:50.783 --> 01:22:53.494
Sneaking in like that,
I should call the police.

01:22:53.578 --> 01:22:55.830
No, no, no. You don't want
to do anything like that.

01:22:55.955 --> 01:23:00.418
This is not your everyday,
average situation.

01:23:08.344 --> 01:23:10.763
She's our mother, is the thing.

01:23:10.804 --> 01:23:13.349
- We're her sons.
- Twin sons.

01:23:16.435 --> 01:23:18.646
You're comedians.

01:23:18.729 --> 01:23:23.484
No. - No. We-we're
kind of a surprise.

01:23:23.567 --> 01:23:27.489
I'll bet you are. Follow me.

01:23:33.328 --> 01:23:36.373
- We were right.
- Lt is her.

01:23:43.421 --> 01:23:45.423
Excuse me.

01:23:47.175 --> 01:23:49.345
- We thought that this is-
- Mary Ann Benedict?

01:23:49.387 --> 01:23:52.348
This is an artists' colony.
There are a lot of painters.

01:23:52.473 --> 01:23:56.060
Come on.

01:23:57.562 --> 01:23:59.981
I can't wait to meet her.

01:24:00.022 --> 01:24:02.149
- Yeah.
- It's gotta be amazing.

01:24:02.191 --> 01:24:05.152
Look. Mary Ann Benedict
never understood...

01:24:05.236 --> 01:24:07.947
Why people wanted
to buy her paintings.

01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:11.034
But for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.

01:24:11.118 --> 01:24:14.496
She used the money
to buy whispering pines.

01:24:16.456 --> 01:24:18.625
May I ask you a question?

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:22.713
Why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?

01:24:22.838 --> 01:24:28.051
Because... She passed
away some time ago.

01:24:29.887 --> 01:24:32.265
She passed-

01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:35.643
you jus-you just said
she was here.

01:24:35.727 --> 01:24:40.064
I meant, her spirit.
Her spirit is always here.

01:24:43.818 --> 01:24:45.361
Come on.

01:25:10.387 --> 01:25:13.933
Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

01:25:16.436 --> 01:25:19.189
Those damn real estate developers!

01:25:19.272 --> 01:25:22.776
They won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.

01:25:22.859 --> 01:25:25.445
Oh, is that who they were?

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:28.281
They're shameless.
They'll try anything.

01:25:30.283 --> 01:25:34.120
Do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?

01:25:34.204 --> 01:25:36.373
- If you can believe that!
- What?

01:25:36.456 --> 01:25:39.126
It was really quite upsetting.

01:25:39.252 --> 01:25:41.462
Mary Ann, I am sorry.

01:25:41.587 --> 01:25:43.798
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

01:25:43.923 --> 01:25:46.133
You get over things.

01:25:48.344 --> 01:25:50.888
I did have a child once.

01:25:50.972 --> 01:25:53.808
But he died at birth.

01:25:59.606 --> 01:26:02.359
You should be proud of her.

01:26:02.484 --> 01:26:04.653
She donates her house, land...

01:26:04.736 --> 01:26:07.155
And all her paintings
to young artists.

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:10.284
Linda, do I look like
a young artist?

01:26:10.325 --> 01:26:13.495
All she meant... I know what
she meant, and why she's here.

01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:16.081
It's got nothing to do
with finding my mother...

01:26:16.164 --> 01:26:18.292
And everything to do with money.

01:26:18.333 --> 01:26:22.297
- That's not true and you know it.
- Bullshit!

01:26:22.338 --> 01:26:25.383
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

01:26:25.508 --> 01:26:28.344
Look who decided to chime in!

01:26:28.386 --> 01:26:30.346
The creature from
the black lagoon.

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:32.640
I should've had my head
examined listening to you.

01:26:32.765 --> 01:26:34.726
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity...

01:26:34.851 --> 01:26:37.520
And I'm out looking
for a dead mother.

01:26:37.604 --> 01:26:39.082
All I wanted was to
make us into a family.

01:26:39.106 --> 01:26:40.607
Family, my butt!

01:26:40.690 --> 01:26:42.902
There's no family here.

01:26:43.027 --> 01:26:45.863
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

01:26:45.988 --> 01:26:48.115
I don't know
why I listen to people.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.534
- I don't know why I do it.
- Cut it out.

01:26:50.618 --> 01:26:52.578
Vince!

01:26:52.703 --> 01:26:54.580
- I'm leaving.
- No, stop!

01:26:54.663 --> 01:26:56.749
Stop! What are you doing?

01:26:56.874 --> 01:26:59.543
You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

01:26:59.668 --> 01:27:02.713
Where do you think you're going?

01:27:02.796 --> 01:27:06.051
He dumped us in
the middle of new Mexico.

01:27:06.176 --> 01:27:10.430
I can't-Julius!

01:27:10.555 --> 01:27:12.933
You don't know this...

01:27:13.058 --> 01:27:15.810
And I promised Vince
that I wouldn't tell you...

01:27:15.936 --> 01:27:19.689
But he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

01:27:19.773 --> 01:27:24.569
I'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

01:27:28.991 --> 01:27:31.577
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr beetroot.

01:27:31.702 --> 01:27:36.165
Yeah, I'll find it. Yeah.

01:27:36.249 --> 01:27:38.251
Yes, I have a map.

01:27:38.292 --> 01:27:40.419
All right. I'll see you there.

01:27:40.545 --> 01:27:42.672
See you in Houston
in the morning.

01:27:42.797 --> 01:27:45.258
I'll be looking forward to it.

01:27:45.383 --> 01:27:47.928
What a coincidence.

01:27:48.053 --> 01:27:49.972
That was our friend.

01:27:50.055 --> 01:27:53.433
Looks like I'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

01:27:53.517 --> 01:27:54.810
Sorry.

01:27:54.935 --> 01:27:57.229
I would have done
the same thing.

01:27:57.312 --> 01:28:00.774
You want the merchandise.
It's not your problem who delivers.

01:28:00.857 --> 01:28:02.651
Precisely.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:11.035
But how will you find him?

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.079
I have him in my head.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:16.875
I found him once,
I'll find him again.

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:19.294
I hope so. Bye.

01:28:19.377 --> 01:28:21.629
Be careful.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:24.132
Brother to brother

01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:28.970
brother to brother

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:34.059
one to another

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:37.104
like no other

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:41.317
brother to brother
brother to brother

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:44.111
never knew you existed

01:28:44.153 --> 01:28:46.447
never saw you in my dreams

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.741
if there were signs
I must've missed 'em

01:28:48.866 --> 01:28:51.328
who would I believe

01:28:51.411 --> 01:28:53.663
now all of a sudden

01:28:53.788 --> 01:28:55.832
we're sharing this skin

01:28:55.916 --> 01:28:58.460
like a shadow you stick to me

01:28:58.543 --> 01:29:01.004
through every jam I'm in

01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:03.673
brother to brother

01:29:03.798 --> 01:29:07.802
you took me by the hand
brother to brother

01:29:07.844 --> 01:29:11.681
you helped me understand
one to another

01:29:11.765 --> 01:29:14.852
there'll never be another no, no

01:29:14.977 --> 01:29:20.024
brother to brother my brother

01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:25.112
when I felt like a zero

01:29:26.447 --> 01:29:29.700
you became my hero

01:29:29.784 --> 01:29:32.203
one to another

01:29:32.286 --> 01:29:35.374
you have been my brother

01:29:35.499 --> 01:29:39.211
my brother whoa

01:29:39.336 --> 01:29:40.504
brother to brother

01:29:41.588 --> 01:29:45.050
when I was up against the wall

01:29:45.133 --> 01:29:47.719
about to take a really big fall

01:29:58.982 --> 01:30:00.900
sorry I'm late.

01:30:00.942 --> 01:30:05.154
- The directions you gave me weren't-
- Step back.

01:30:07.865 --> 01:30:10.410
Get over here.

01:30:10.493 --> 01:30:13.121
I'm unarmed.

01:30:13.246 --> 01:30:15.290
He's clean.

01:30:15.415 --> 01:30:18.752
Oh, oh. Isn't that pretty!

01:30:18.877 --> 01:30:20.754
Yeah, it is.

01:30:20.838 --> 01:30:24.133
- Did you come here alone, unarmed?
- Yeah.

01:30:24.216 --> 01:30:26.260
You're just some fool
who stole a car?

01:30:26.302 --> 01:30:29.930
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:30:30.014 --> 01:30:32.850
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you?

01:30:32.933 --> 01:30:35.936
No.

01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:39.608
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

01:30:39.733 --> 01:30:42.611
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

01:30:42.694 --> 01:30:46.948
Somebody else developed it,
but I just had to have it.

01:30:47.073 --> 01:30:49.326
Crafty devil, huh?

01:30:50.410 --> 01:30:52.621
What are you waiting for?

01:30:53.955 --> 01:30:55.957
Wait a minute, beetroot!

01:30:56.041 --> 01:30:58.710
- I thought we had a deal.
- We do.

01:31:08.387 --> 01:31:10.473
Five million bucks!

01:31:10.598 --> 01:31:13.643
- You wanna count it?
- No, no.

01:31:13.726 --> 01:31:18.481
- But I could use a lift to town.
- Don't press your luck.

01:31:18.522 --> 01:31:20.483
Okay. That's all right.

01:31:20.566 --> 01:31:24.488
I gassed it up for you,
beetroot. Thank you!

01:31:24.571 --> 01:31:29.493
Five million dollars!
Five million bucks!

01:31:29.618 --> 01:31:32.871
Ha-ha-ha! Five million bucks!

01:31:32.996 --> 01:31:35.582
I've gotta look at it!

01:31:37.251 --> 01:31:39.836
Uh-oh.

01:32:20.212 --> 01:32:22.506
Hey, Benedict!

01:32:22.548 --> 01:32:25.426
All I want is the money.

01:32:25.551 --> 01:32:29.431
Just give me what's mine
and I'll leave you alone.

01:33:06.427 --> 01:33:08.763
Steps! Steps!

01:33:20.150 --> 01:33:22.611
Leave my brother alone.

01:33:23.779 --> 01:33:26.323
No.

01:33:26.448 --> 01:33:28.325
Julius.

01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:31.621
No, no, no.

01:33:31.746 --> 01:33:34.540
No, no.

01:33:37.418 --> 01:33:40.797
Julius, you're-you're here?

01:33:40.838 --> 01:33:43.299
No. No, you idiot.

01:33:43.383 --> 01:33:45.635
Don't be nervous.

01:33:45.677 --> 01:33:49.055
I hate violence.
Plus I never carry a gun.

01:33:49.138 --> 01:33:51.724
Who are you?

01:33:51.808 --> 01:33:53.811
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:33:53.936 --> 01:33:55.896
Put the gun down.
I got the money.

01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:58.816
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

01:33:58.857 --> 01:34:01.986
Here's the money.

01:34:02.111 --> 01:34:04.572
You're a goddamned millionaire.

01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:10.661
You, I am never
gonna forgive... never.

01:34:10.744 --> 01:34:14.331
- Open it.
- Open it?

01:34:14.415 --> 01:34:17.877
You were going to get killed.

01:34:18.003 --> 01:34:19.814
I was trying to distract
him so you could escape.

01:34:19.838 --> 01:34:21.673
I already had escaped!

01:34:21.756 --> 01:34:25.302
I was halfway to Brazil
when I felt you!

01:34:25.343 --> 01:34:28.555
- Close it.
- Close it?

01:34:28.638 --> 01:34:30.724
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

01:34:30.849 --> 01:34:34.519
- Why didn't you go?
- Why didn't I go?

01:34:34.644 --> 01:34:38.399
Because thanks to you,
I'm not only a goddamned psychic-

01:34:38.524 --> 01:34:40.026
Benedict!

01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:42.695
- I think the case belongs to me.
- Oh, sorry.

01:34:42.737 --> 01:34:46.866
I got this disease
called a conscience.

01:34:46.949 --> 01:34:50.578
- No one ever said being good was easy.
- "No one ever said-"

01:34:50.703 --> 01:34:52.204
will you two shut up!

01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:55.041
Butt out, pal!
You got your money.

01:34:55.124 --> 01:34:58.211
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

01:34:58.253 --> 01:35:00.505
Try Brazil.

01:35:00.547 --> 01:35:03.926
It doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

01:35:04.051 --> 01:35:06.219
Which one's first?

01:35:06.345 --> 01:35:10.182
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?

01:35:10.224 --> 01:35:11.725
You got it.

01:35:11.850 --> 01:35:15.354
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

01:35:15.395 --> 01:35:18.774
- The third rule?
- Third rule?

01:35:18.899 --> 01:35:21.778
Yeah, third rule.

01:35:25.907 --> 01:35:27.784
Oooh!

01:35:27.867 --> 01:35:31.120
- The third rule.
- What's the third rule?

01:35:31.204 --> 01:35:32.789
Duck!

01:36:02.779 --> 01:36:05.115
Yo!

01:36:05.156 --> 01:36:08.118
Holy-shmoly!

01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:16.626
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:22.299
Thanks for coming back, Vincent.

01:36:22.382 --> 01:36:25.303
We're brothers, right?

01:36:25.428 --> 01:36:27.638
- We're family.
- That's right.

01:36:30.558 --> 01:36:33.019
A rich family.

01:36:33.102 --> 01:36:35.521
- A good family.
- What? What?

01:36:35.646 --> 01:36:38.190
- We're gonna return this money.
- No.

01:36:38.316 --> 01:36:40.484
- We don't have to give it back.
- Yes, we do.

01:36:40.610 --> 01:36:42.653
- Why? Why?
- We have to, believe me.

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:49.161
- Mary Ann?
- Hmm?

01:36:49.244 --> 01:36:52.414
I think you'd better come
take a look at this.

01:36:52.497 --> 01:36:55.792
What is it?

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.863
Mary Ann?

01:37:23.988 --> 01:37:28.034
What a pleasant surprise.

01:37:30.663 --> 01:37:33.666
You stole my family.

01:37:33.707 --> 01:37:36.877
You lying son of a bitch.

01:37:42.675 --> 01:37:45.052
Linda, I'm sorry.

01:37:45.177 --> 01:37:47.721
I made a terrible mistake
and I apologize.

01:37:47.805 --> 01:37:50.517
I- all I'm asking for
is another chance.

01:37:50.642 --> 01:37:52.560
I know I don't deserve this-

01:37:52.686 --> 01:37:54.854
that's right,
you don't deserve it.

01:38:10.161 --> 01:38:12.123
Vince?

01:38:26.429 --> 01:38:29.890
Yes, this is the
Benedict corporation.

01:38:29.932 --> 01:38:33.102
We are a consulting firm...
A think tank.

01:38:33.227 --> 01:38:36.440
Something like
the rand corporation.

01:38:36.565 --> 01:38:38.942
- Only smarter.
- Only smarter.

01:38:39.067 --> 01:38:41.111
Tomorrow at 3:00.

01:38:41.236 --> 01:38:44.615
Yes, I'll put you down.

01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:46.575
Good night, mr benedicts.

01:38:46.658 --> 01:38:48.785
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:38:48.827 --> 01:38:52.623
That's it.
The last cheque is written.

01:38:52.748 --> 01:38:56.127
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?

01:38:56.169 --> 01:38:59.088
After we've paid off
all our debts...

01:38:59.130 --> 01:39:02.050
We have exactly $12,278.

01:39:02.133 --> 01:39:05.929
- $12,278. That's terrible.
- What?

01:39:06.012 --> 01:39:08.932
You're just upset because
I made you return that suitcase.

01:39:11.809 --> 01:39:15.313
Oh, the money.

01:39:15.438 --> 01:39:17.816
You mean the
four million dollars.

01:39:19.068 --> 01:39:21.487
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:24.823
Say it... Four million dollars.

01:39:24.907 --> 01:39:27.493
It's a lot of money, Jules.

01:39:27.618 --> 01:39:30.829
Vincent...
I'm very proud of you.

01:39:30.955 --> 01:39:38.505
Well... Yeah, I'm kinda
proud of myself.

01:39:38.588 --> 01:39:41.967
Isn't it great to be one
of the good guys for a change?

01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:45.178
It feels great to be a good guy!

01:39:45.220 --> 01:39:48.348
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh?

01:39:48.431 --> 01:39:51.643
- You did steal a car though.
- I borrowed one.

01:39:51.726 --> 01:39:55.105
I brought it back the next day.
I explained it to the man.

01:39:55.230 --> 01:39:57.023
He was a cowboy.

01:39:57.107 --> 01:40:00.111
Excuse me? I'm-

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:03.864
oh, my God. I don't even know
which one is which.

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:10.538
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

01:40:10.621 --> 01:40:13.916
You see, I didn't
believe your story.

01:40:14.041 --> 01:40:17.044
Who would believe
a crazy story like that?

01:40:21.048 --> 01:40:23.594
They lied to me all these years.

01:40:23.677 --> 01:40:26.763
They lied to you, too.

01:40:33.854 --> 01:40:37.065
You found each other.

01:40:43.573 --> 01:40:45.742
Now you found me.

01:41:05.346 --> 01:41:07.264
Mama?

01:41:08.933 --> 01:41:10.267
Mama!

01:41:12.311 --> 01:41:13.812
Mama!

01:41:13.938 --> 01:41:16.273
Oh, mama!

01:41:34.542 --> 01:41:36.836
Good.

01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:39.172
Tickets?

01:41:39.297 --> 01:41:41.174
Thanks. This is gonna be great.

01:41:41.299 --> 01:41:44.135
I just can't get over
how alike they are.

01:41:44.177 --> 01:41:47.305
Yes, it's a beautiful day.

01:42:19.172 --> 01:42:23.176
Twins united outside and in

01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:25.137
mm-mm, uh-huh

01:42:26.179 --> 01:42:28.181
when you're twins

01:42:28.265 --> 01:42:31.394
the magic just never ends

01:42:33.688 --> 01:42:37.233
what happened to you
hey, I could feel it

01:42:37.358 --> 01:42:40.862
I smile and I cry
without knowing why

01:42:40.987 --> 01:42:44.532
your joy and your pain
would be so real

01:42:44.616 --> 01:42:48.620
I felt like my life
was happenin' again

01:42:48.745 --> 01:42:52.332
and now I know it's
'cause you're part of me

01:42:52.373 --> 01:42:55.878
wasn't my choice
it was meant to be

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:59.590
we were connected
even when apart

01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:03.218
we got together
now the real problems start

01:43:03.302 --> 01:43:07.139
twins united outside and in

01:43:07.222 --> 01:43:09.600
yeah

01:43:09.725 --> 01:43:12.019
when you're twins

01:43:12.102 --> 01:43:14.898
the magic just never ends

01:43:19.235 --> 01:43:22.822
if one me is good
then two is better

01:43:22.906 --> 01:43:26.660
well, I can't complain
'cause I'm ahead of the game

01:43:26.743 --> 01:43:30.247
we split the pain
double the pleasure

01:43:30.372 --> 01:43:33.917
I'm starting to feel
life gave us a deal

01:43:34.042 --> 01:43:37.922
no, we're not just
your average family

01:43:38.047 --> 01:43:41.592
got benefits
most people never see

01:43:41.676 --> 01:43:45.263
and if I had a chance
to live again

01:43:45.304 --> 01:43:48.599
I wouldn't want it
unless I was your twin

01:43:48.641 --> 01:43:53.437
twins united outside and in

01:43:53.479 --> 01:43:55.356
ah, yeah

01:43:55.439 --> 01:43:57.609
when you're twins

01:43:57.693 --> 01:44:00.737
the magic just never ends

01:44:00.779 --> 01:44:03.031
ah, yeah

01:44:03.115 --> 01:44:07.619
twins united outside and in

01:44:07.703 --> 01:44:08.954
mm-mm, uh-huh

01:44:09.955 --> 01:44:12.291
when you're twins

01:44:12.374 --> 01:44:15.460
the magic just never ends
