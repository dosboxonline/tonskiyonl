04:03.834 --> 04:05.708
Oh!

04:13.876 --> 04:15.791
Ah!

04:17.250 --> 04:18.666
Doug?

04:21.000 --> 04:23.208
Honey, are you all right?

04:25.501 --> 04:28.250
You were dreaming. Doug?

04:29.334 --> 04:31.291
Was it about Mars?

04:37.001 --> 04:39.166
- Is that better?
- Hmm.

04:41.501 --> 04:43.166
My poor baby.

04:44.292 --> 04:46.666
This is getting to be an obsession.

04:54.584 --> 04:56.000
Was she there?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.000
Who?

05:01.667 --> 05:04.291
The one you told me about.
The brunette.

05:05.167 --> 05:06.791
Oh, Lori.

05:09.751 --> 05:12.625
I can't believe
you're jealous of a dream.

05:13.501 --> 05:16.166
- Who is she?
- Nobody.

05:16.334 --> 05:18.625
"Nobody"? What's her name?

05:18.792 --> 05:21.291
I don't know.

05:21.459 --> 05:23.333
- Tell me!
- I don't know!

05:23.501 --> 05:25.458
You better tell me!

05:25.626 --> 05:29.291
It's not funny, Doug.
You dream about her every night.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.041
And I'm always back
in the morning.

05:32.209 --> 05:34.250
Let me go!

05:36.251 --> 05:38.375
Come on, baby.

05:38.542 --> 05:41.208
You know you're the girl
of my dreams.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.375
You mean it?

05:44.501 --> 05:46.375
You know I do.

05:55.834 --> 05:58.791
I'll give you
something to dream about.

06:08.542 --> 06:12.166
<i>The chairman defended the attack,
saying that space-based weapons</i>

06:12.334 --> 06:16.333
<i>are our only defence against the
southern block's numerical superiority.</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:18.833
<i>And more violence last night on Mars</i>

06:19.001 --> 06:21.250
<i>where terrorists
demanding independence</i>

06:21.417 --> 06:24.833
<i>once again halted the extraction
of terbinium ore.</i>

06:29.876 --> 06:31.958
<i>Kuato and his so-called
freedom brigade</i>

06:32.126 --> 06:34.083
<i>claimed credit
for this latest bombing,</i>

06:34.251 --> 06:37.833
<i>which attempted to reopen
the sealed-off Pyramid Mines.</i>

06:41.126 --> 06:44.250
<i>Mars military restored order
with minimal use of force</i>

06:44.417 --> 06:48.291
<i>and all damage to the strategic facility
was repaired within hours.</i>

06:48.459 --> 06:49.750
<i>No cameras!</i>

06:49.917 --> 06:53.875
<i>With one mine already closed,
Mars administrator Vilos Cohaagen</i>

06:54.042 --> 06:56.125
<i>vowed that troops
would be used if necessary</i>

06:56.292 --> 06:59.000
<i>to keep production at full capacity...</i>

07:00.167 --> 07:03.916
No wonder you're having nightmares.
You're always watching the news.

07:08.001 --> 07:09.916
- Lori.
- Doug?

07:10.084 --> 07:13.500
- Let's do it.
- Do what?

07:13.667 --> 07:15.041
Move to Mars.

07:16.209 --> 07:19.541
Honey, why do you have to spoil
a perfectly wonderful morning?

07:21.251 --> 07:22.666
Just think about it.

07:24.834 --> 07:28.333
Sweetheart, we've been through this
a million times. You'd hate it on Mars.

07:28.501 --> 07:31.333
It's dry, it's ugly, it's boring.

07:32.584 --> 07:36.333
I mean, really, a revolution could
break out there any second.

07:36.501 --> 07:39.541
Cohaagen says
it's just a few extremists.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.166
You believe him?

07:47.167 --> 07:49.458
OK. Forget about it.

07:52.334 --> 07:56.791
<i>Absolutely not. Mars was colonised by
the northern block at enormous expense.</i>

07:56.959 --> 08:00.500
<i>Our entire war effort
depends on their terbinium.</i>

08:00.667 --> 08:04.083
<i>It's ridiculous to think we'd give it away
just because some lazy mutants...</i>

08:04.251 --> 08:05.333
Doug.

08:07.042 --> 08:10.750
- Maybe we should take a trip.
- Lori, move, please.

08:10.917 --> 08:14.500
<i>...you've closed the Pyramid Mine
because you found alien artefacts?</i>

08:14.667 --> 08:17.875
There's a lot better places
than Mars.

08:18.042 --> 08:20.916
What about Saturn?
Don't you wanna see Saturn?

08:21.084 --> 08:22.875
<i>I wish we could find some artefacts.</i>

08:23.042 --> 08:25.083
<i>Our tourist industry could use a boost.</i>

08:25.251 --> 08:27.625
Everybody says that its gorgeous.

08:27.792 --> 08:31.416
<i>Fact is, it's Mr Kuato and his terrorists
who spread these rumours</i>

08:31.584 --> 08:33.582
<i>to undermine trust in the government.</i>

08:33.751 --> 08:37.416
We could take a long space cruise,
the kind with nothing to do.

08:37.583 --> 08:41.082
- <i>Have you found Kuato yet?</i>
- <i>We don't even know what he looks like.</i>

08:41.251 --> 08:45.250
- What do you say?
- I'm late, Lori.

08:50.417 --> 08:52.791
Sweetheart. Doug.

08:55.417 --> 08:59.583
I know it's hard being in a new town,
but let's give it a chance, OK?

09:01.542 --> 09:03.500
Lori, don't you understand?

09:03.667 --> 09:06.500
I feel like I was meant
for something more than this.

09:07.459 --> 09:11.291
I want to do something with my life.
I want to be somebody.

09:11.459 --> 09:13.416
You are somebody.

09:13.584 --> 09:15.541
You're the man I love.

09:20.251 --> 09:21.750
Bye.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.208
Have a nice day.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.958
<i>You are now entering
a safety zone.</i>

09:48.126 --> 09:52.250
<i>No unauthorised weapons allowed
beyond this point.</i>

09:52.417 --> 09:55.791
<i>You are now entering a safety zone.</i>

09:55.959 --> 10:00.041
<i>No unauthorised weapons allowed
beyond this point.</i>

10:02.834 --> 10:08.208
<i>Would you like to ski
but you're snowed under with work?</i>

10:08.376 --> 10:12.500
<i>Do you dream of a vacation
at the bottom of the ocean,</i>

10:12.667 --> 10:15.000
<i>but you can't float the bill?</i>

10:15.167 --> 10:18.833
<i>Have you always wanted
to climb the mountains of Mars...</i>

10:20.167 --> 10:22.458
<i>...but now you're over the hill?</i>

10:23.584 --> 10:25.583
<i>Then come to Rekall Incorporated</i>

10:25.751 --> 10:28.583
<i>where you can buy the memory
of your ideal vacation</i>

10:28.751 --> 10:31.333
<i>cheaper, safer and better
than the real thing.</i>

10:32.042 --> 10:34.250
<i>So don't let life pass you by.</i>

10:34.417 --> 10:37.791
<i>Call Rekall for the memory of a lifetime.</i>

10:37.959 --> 10:41.791
<i>For the memory of a lifetime</i>

10:41.959 --> 10:45.458
<i>Rekall, Rekall, Rekall</i>

11:04.084 --> 11:05.208
Harry.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.875
- Harry! You ever hear of Rekall?
- Rekall?

11:11.042 --> 11:12.875
Where they sell
those fake memories.

11:13.042 --> 11:17.125
Oh, Rekall!
Rekall, rekall, rekall!

11:17.292 --> 11:19.416
- Thinking of going there?
- I don't know. Maybe.

11:19.584 --> 11:21.250
- Well, don't.
- Why not?

11:21.417 --> 11:25.958
A friend of mine tried one of their special
offers, nearly got himself lobotomised.

11:26.709 --> 11:27.791
No shit?

11:27.959 --> 11:30.666
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.
It ain't worth it.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.458
I guess not.

12:15.917 --> 12:17.833
Hello.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.041
Good afternoon.
Welcome to Rekall.

12:21.209 --> 12:23.291
Douglas Quaid.
I have an appointment.

12:26.792 --> 12:28.250
- Bob?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

12:28.417 --> 12:30.500
- Doug Quaid is here to see you.
- <i>I'll be right out.</i>

12:30.667 --> 12:32.083
OK.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.208
That'll be just one minute, Mr Quaid.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.208
Thank you.

12:44.542 --> 12:47.958
- Doug! Bob McClane. Good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

12:48.126 --> 12:50.333
Come on in. Through here.

12:51.417 --> 12:53.125
Go and have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

12:53.292 --> 12:54.541
- Thank you.

12:54.709 --> 12:56.333
Now, help me out here, Doug.

12:56.501 --> 12:59.583
- You were interested in a memory of...
- Of Mars.

13:00.292 --> 13:01.791
Yeah. Mars.

13:01.959 --> 13:04.125
- Is there a problem?
- Uh...

13:05.417 --> 13:08.500
To be perfectly honest with you, Doug,
if outer space is your thing,

13:08.667 --> 13:11.583
you'd be much happier
with one of our Saturn cruises.

13:11.751 --> 13:13.166
Everybody raves about them.

13:13.334 --> 13:16.166
No. I'm not interested in Saturn.
I said Mars.

13:17.084 --> 13:19.166
OK. You're the boss.

13:19.917 --> 13:21.833
Mars it is.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.250
Now, let me see.

13:24.417 --> 13:29.750
The basic Mars package
will run you 899 credits.

13:29.917 --> 13:33.208
Now, that's for two full weeks
of memories, complete in every detail.

13:33.376 --> 13:36.833
If you want a longer trip, that'll cost you
more cos it's a deeper implant.

13:37.001 --> 13:39.291
What's in the two-week package?

13:39.459 --> 13:43.000
When you go Rekall, you get nothing
but first-class memories.

13:44.292 --> 13:48.041
Private cabin on the shuttle, deluxe suite
at the Hilton, all the major sights:

13:48.209 --> 13:53.041
Mount Pyramid, the Grand Canals
and of course, Venusville.

13:53.209 --> 13:54.958
But how real does it seem?

13:55.126 --> 13:59.208
- As real as any memory in your head.
- Come on. Don't bullshit me.

13:59.376 --> 14:02.166
No. I'm telling you, Doug.
Your brain will not know the difference.

14:02.334 --> 14:04.333
And that's guaranteed
or your money back.

14:04.501 --> 14:07.875
What about the guy you lobotomised?
Did he get a refund?

14:11.584 --> 14:13.541
You're talking ancient history.

14:13.709 --> 14:17.500
Nowadays, travelling with Rekall
is safer than getting on a rocket.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.625
Check out those statistics.

14:19.792 --> 14:23.333
Besides, a real holiday
is a pain in the butt.

14:23.501 --> 14:28.208
You got lost luggage, lousy weather,
crooked taxi drivers.

14:28.376 --> 14:33.625
When you travel with Rekall,
everything is perfect.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.875
So, what do you say?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.625
- All right.
- Smart move.

14:39.792 --> 14:43.083
All right,
while you fill out this questionnaire,

14:43.251 --> 14:45.666
I'm going to familiarise you
with some of our options.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.416
No options.

14:48.292 --> 14:51.791
Whatever you say.
Can I ask you just one question?

14:52.792 --> 14:54.708
What is that is exactly the same

14:54.876 --> 14:57.875
about every single vacation
you have ever taken?

14:58.876 --> 15:00.083
I give up.

15:00.251 --> 15:02.875
You. You're the same.

15:03.042 --> 15:05.625
No matter where you go, there you are.
It's always the same old you.

15:06.584 --> 15:10.458
Let me suggest that you take
a vacation from yourself.

15:10.626 --> 15:12.250
I know, it sounds wild.

15:12.417 --> 15:15.125
It is the latest thing in travel.
We call it the Ego Trip.

15:15.292 --> 15:17.333
No. I'm not interested in that.

15:17.501 --> 15:19.250
You're gonna love this, Doug.

15:19.417 --> 15:22.958
We offer you a choice of
alternate identities during your trip.

15:23.126 --> 15:26.625
Why go to Mars as a tourist,
when you can go as a playboy?

15:26.792 --> 15:29.750
- Or a famous jock or...?
- "Secret agent."

15:29.917 --> 15:31.625
How much is that?

15:32.959 --> 15:36.166
A-ha! Let me tantalise you.

15:37.334 --> 15:42.000
You are a top operative under deep cover
on your most important mission.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.666
People are trying to kill you.
Left and right!

15:44.834 --> 15:47.791
You meet this beautiful,
exotic woman.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.041
Go on.

15:49.209 --> 15:51.833
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug,

15:52.001 --> 15:54.041
but by the time the trip is over,

15:54.209 --> 15:58.125
you get the girl, kill the bad guys
and save the entire planet.

15:58.292 --> 16:03.000
Now, you tell me.
Isn't that worth a measly 300 credits?

16:17.334 --> 16:19.583
- Your first trip?
- Mm-hm.

16:19.751 --> 16:22.916
Well, don't worry. Things hardly ever
fuck up around here.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.958
Good evening... Doug.

16:26.126 --> 16:28.208
- I'm Dr Lull.
- Nice to meet you.

16:28.376 --> 16:32.208
Ernie, patch in matrix 62-B-37.

16:32.376 --> 16:35.250
And would you like us
to integrate some alien stuff?

16:35.417 --> 16:37.500
Sure. Why not?

16:38.792 --> 16:42.166
- Two-headed monsters?
- Don't you keep up with the news?

16:42.334 --> 16:45.916
- We're doing alien artefacts now.
- It's wild.

16:46.084 --> 16:48.666
Yeah, they date back a million years.

16:50.084 --> 16:51.750
- Ernie?
- That's a new one.

16:51.917 --> 16:53.666
- Blue sky on Mars.
- Been married long?

16:54.751 --> 16:57.375
- Eight years.
- Oh, I see.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.708
Slipping away for
a little hanky-panky.

16:59.876 --> 17:02.666
- No. I'm fascinated with Mars.
- All systems go.

17:02.834 --> 17:04.625
Then we're set.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.540
Ready for dreamland?

17:08.709 --> 17:12.790
I'll be asking you some questions
so we can fine-tune the Ego program.

17:12.959 --> 17:15.790
You answer honestly,
you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.

17:15.959 --> 17:18.708
- Your sexual orientation.
- Hetero.

17:24.251 --> 17:26.290
So, how do you like your women?

17:26.459 --> 17:29.250
Blonde? Brunette? Redhead?

17:30.042 --> 17:31.416
Brunette.

17:33.751 --> 17:38.041
Slim. Athletic. Voluptuous.

17:41.084 --> 17:42.541
Athletic.

17:46.876 --> 17:50.708
Demure. Aggressive. Sleazy.

17:50.876 --> 17:53.875
- Be honest.
- Sleazy.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.416
Demure.

18:02.251 --> 18:04.041
41A, Ernie.

18:05.459 --> 18:07.458
Boy, is he gonna have a wild time.

18:08.584 --> 18:11.958
- He's not gonna want to come back.
- Oh, that's for sure.

18:33.251 --> 18:34.250
So...

18:34.417 --> 18:36.250
what do you say?

18:36.417 --> 18:39.333
I'm not so sure,
and I don't get a souvenir.

18:39.501 --> 18:41.666
Not true. For just a few more credits,

18:41.834 --> 18:44.625
we supply T-shirts,
snapshots of you at the site,

18:44.792 --> 18:46.666
and even letters from...

18:46.834 --> 18:50.125
<i>Bob!</i>

18:50.292 --> 18:52.416
- What is it?
- <i>You'd better get down here.</i>

18:52.584 --> 18:54.625
I am with a very important client.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.250
<i>Looks like we got
another schizoid embolism.</i>

18:58.959 --> 19:01.625
- I'll be right back.
- Uh... Mr McClane?

19:01.792 --> 19:05.166
- Mr McClane?
- Bob! What's wrong?

19:05.334 --> 19:07.250
Don't let her leave!

19:11.959 --> 19:13.625
Get off!

19:13.792 --> 19:15.416
Ah!

19:15.584 --> 19:17.250
You blew my cover!

19:17.417 --> 19:20.541
What's going on? You can't do
a simple goddamn double implant?

19:20.709 --> 19:22.375
It's not my fault we hit a memory cap.

19:22.542 --> 19:25.000
They'll be here any minute!
They'll kill you all!

19:25.167 --> 19:27.458
- What is he talking about?
- Let me go!

19:27.626 --> 19:29.458
Mr Quaid, try to calm down!

19:31.584 --> 19:33.833
My name is not Quaid.

19:34.001 --> 19:36.833
- Let me go! Untie me now!
- Ernie, grab his leg!

19:37.001 --> 19:38.500
- Untie me!
- Hold him down!

19:38.667 --> 19:40.583
Let me go!

19:47.126 --> 19:48.666
Ah!

20:04.334 --> 20:06.291
Are you all right?

20:06.459 --> 20:09.750
Listen to me.
He's been going on and on about Mars.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.500
- He has really been there.
- Use your head, you dumb bitch.

20:12.667 --> 20:16.041
He's just acting out the "secret agent"
portion of his ego trip.

20:16.209 --> 20:17.875
- I'm afraid that's not possible.
- Why not?

20:18.042 --> 20:19.875
Because we haven't implanted it yet.

20:23.959 --> 20:25.250
Oh, shit.

20:25.417 --> 20:26.791
Oh, shit!

20:26.959 --> 20:30.375
I've been trying to tell you,
someone has erased his memory.

20:30.542 --> 20:33.625
Excuse me. "Someone"?

20:33.792 --> 20:35.833
We're talking about the fucking Agency.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.666
- Shut up!
- Bob, the client's gone.

20:39.626 --> 20:42.125
OK, all right. All right, look.
Here's what we're going to do.

20:42.292 --> 20:44.916
Renata, cover up any memory
he's got of us or Rekall.

20:45.084 --> 20:46.916
I'll do what I can.
It's pretty messy in there.

20:47.084 --> 20:50.083
Ernie, dump him in a cab around
the corner. Tiffany, you help him.

20:50.251 --> 20:52.166
I'm gonna destroy his file
and refund his money.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.583
And if anybody comes asking,
we never heard of Douglas Quaid.

21:11.001 --> 21:12.416
Where am I?

21:14.959 --> 21:18.375
- You're in a Johnnycab.
- What am I doing here?

21:18.542 --> 21:21.833
I'm sorry. Would you please
rephrase the question?

21:22.001 --> 21:24.041
How did I get in this taxi?

21:24.209 --> 21:26.958
The door opened, you got in.

21:28.876 --> 21:31.458
Hell of a day, isn't it?

21:45.084 --> 21:47.083
- This OK?
- Right here.

21:47.251 --> 21:49.916
- Thank you for taking Johnnycab.
- Thank you.

21:50.084 --> 21:52.250
Hope you enjoyed the ride.

21:52.417 --> 21:53.791
Hey, Quaid.

21:54.584 --> 21:57.250
- Harry.
- How was your trip to Mars?

21:57.417 --> 22:00.833
- What trip?
- You went to Rekall. Remember?

22:01.834 --> 22:03.875
- I did?
- Yeah, you did.

22:04.042 --> 22:07.333
- I told you not to, but you went anyway.
- What are you, my father?

22:08.917 --> 22:12.125
- Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
- Listen. I'm already late. Thank you...

22:14.001 --> 22:16.958
OK, bring him...
Come on, move it!

22:17.126 --> 22:19.208
Let's go get that drink. Move it!

22:19.376 --> 22:22.750
What the hell is going on?
What the fuck did I do wrong?

22:22.917 --> 22:25.875
- Tell me!
- You blabbed about Mars!

22:26.042 --> 22:29.166
Are you crazy? I don't even know
anything about Mars!

22:29.334 --> 22:33.750
You should've listened to me, Quaid.
I was there to keep you out of trouble.

22:36.126 --> 22:39.916
You're making a big mistake. You got me
mixed up with somebody else.

22:40.084 --> 22:42.416
Uh-uh, pal.
You got yourself mixed up with...

22:46.959 --> 22:47.916
Ah!

23:09.709 --> 23:11.666
Ah!

23:32.709 --> 23:35.250
<i>And pivot... and serve...</i>

23:35.417 --> 23:39.333
<i>and shift... and stroke... and pivot.</i>

23:39.501 --> 23:43.208
<i>And serve... and shift... and stroke.</i>

23:43.376 --> 23:45.291
<i>Very good. Perfect form.</i>

23:45.459 --> 23:48.500
<i>And serve... and shift... and stroke.</i>

23:48.667 --> 23:50.416
Hi, honey.

23:52.584 --> 23:55.583
- What are you doing?
- Some men just tried to kill me.

23:55.751 --> 23:57.125
Muggers? Are you all right?

23:57.292 --> 23:59.333
No, they were spies or something.

23:59.501 --> 24:02.166
And Harry from work, he was the...
Get down!

24:02.334 --> 24:06.041
- Harry from work, he was the boss.
- Take it easy, Doug, OK?

24:06.209 --> 24:09.125
Tell me exactly what happened.
Why would spies want to kill you?

24:09.292 --> 24:11.833
I don't know.
But it had something to do with Mars.

24:12.001 --> 24:13.625
You've never been to Mars.

24:13.792 --> 24:17.125
It sounds crazy, but I went
to this Rekall place after work...

24:17.292 --> 24:19.458
- You went to those brain butchers?
- Let me finish.

24:19.626 --> 24:22.041
- What did they do to you?
- I got a trip to Mars.

24:22.209 --> 24:24.000
- So what happened...
- Oh...

24:24.167 --> 24:27.416
Forget about Rekall. Will you?
These guys were going to kill me.

24:27.584 --> 24:30.291
- Doug, nobody tried to kill you.
- They did.

24:30.459 --> 24:32.416
But I killed them.

24:34.376 --> 24:35.958
Listen to me, sweetheart.

24:36.126 --> 24:39.083
Those assholes at Rekall
have fucked up your mind.

24:39.251 --> 24:41.291
You're having paranoid delusions.

24:41.459 --> 24:44.041
You call this a delusion?

24:49.834 --> 24:51.666
Doug.

24:52.626 --> 24:56.541
- Doug, I'm gonna call a doctor.
- Don't. Don't call anybody.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.666
<i>Hello.</i>

25:24.959 --> 25:27.541
Lori, go! Get out!

25:53.167 --> 25:55.083
Lori?

26:18.542 --> 26:21.291
Why are you doing this, Lori?

26:36.917 --> 26:38.333
Talk! I said talk.

26:38.501 --> 26:40.416
- I'm not your wife.
- The hell you're not.

26:40.584 --> 26:42.625
I never saw you
before six weeks ago.

26:42.792 --> 26:44.875
Our marriage
is just a memory implant.

26:45.042 --> 26:47.791
You think I'm stupid?
I remember our wedding.

26:47.959 --> 26:49.416
It was implanted by the Agency.

26:49.584 --> 26:51.250
- Falling in love.
- Implanted.

26:51.417 --> 26:55.041
Our friends, my job, 8 years together.
All of this was implanted too?

26:55.209 --> 26:57.875
The job's real.
The Agency set it up.

26:58.042 --> 26:59.833
Bullshit.

27:02.126 --> 27:04.666
They erased your identity
and implanted a new one.

27:04.834 --> 27:07.041
I was written in as your wife
so I could watch you

27:07.209 --> 27:09.416
and make sure the erasure took.

27:15.251 --> 27:18.625
Sorry, Quaid.
Your whole life is just a dream.

27:20.876 --> 27:25.166
OK, then if I'm not me,
who the hell am I?

27:25.334 --> 27:26.500
Beats me.

27:27.917 --> 27:30.125
I just work here.

27:35.792 --> 27:37.166
Doug.

27:38.167 --> 27:40.625
Doug, there's something
I want you to know.

27:42.334 --> 27:46.166
You were the best assignment
I ever had. Really.

27:46.334 --> 27:47.875
I'm honoured.

27:48.042 --> 27:52.000
You sure you don't want to,
just for old times' sake?

27:53.001 --> 27:56.125
Come on. If you don't trust me,
you can tie me up.

27:58.334 --> 28:02.041
- I didn't know you were so kinky.
- Maybe it's time you found out.

28:07.459 --> 28:09.041
Clever girl.

28:11.334 --> 28:15.541
You wouldn't shoot me, would you,
Doug? After all we've been through.

28:16.459 --> 28:18.541
Some of it was fun.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.041
Nice knowing you.

28:57.542 --> 28:59.166
Don't touch her.

28:59.334 --> 29:00.666
Nobody here.

29:02.334 --> 29:05.791
- Are you OK?
- I guess I blew it.

29:05.959 --> 29:08.541
- What does he remember?
- Nothing, so far.

29:08.709 --> 29:10.208
I've got him.

29:23.834 --> 29:26.291
Shit, he's going for the subway.
Let's get him. Go.

29:26.459 --> 29:28.833
Let's go. Move it.

29:41.792 --> 29:44.666
Pack your stuff
and get outta here.

29:44.834 --> 29:46.708
What if they bring him back?

29:47.792 --> 29:49.208
Not a chance.

29:58.209 --> 29:59.708
Subway! Go!

30:05.001 --> 30:06.375
Hey!

30:10.042 --> 30:12.500
Get him! He's got a gun!

30:13.292 --> 30:16.166
- Cut him off! That way!
- Over there!

30:16.334 --> 30:18.750
- Hold it!
- Don't move!

30:48.792 --> 30:50.666
The escalator.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.416
You four go up.
You come with me.

31:07.709 --> 31:09.708
Get out of the way! Come on!

31:12.501 --> 31:13.916
Get out of the way! Move!

31:44.709 --> 31:46.000
The platform!

31:49.834 --> 31:52.000
- Which way?
- To the right.

32:18.876 --> 32:23.041
<i>Botco. Tomorrow's fuels,
tomorrow's prices.</i>

32:23.209 --> 32:26.166
<i>Don't settle for pale memories
or fake implants.</i>

32:26.334 --> 32:28.791
<i>Experience space travel
the old-fashioned way</i>

32:28.959 --> 32:32.416
<i>on a real, live holiday
you can afford.</i>

32:38.292 --> 32:40.000
I want that fucker dead.

32:40.167 --> 32:43.291
I don't blame you. I wouldn't want
Quaid porking my old lady.

32:43.459 --> 32:47.916
- You saying she likes it?
- No, I'm sure she hated every minute.

32:50.334 --> 32:54.458
<i>Six-beta-nine, we have
a live transmission from Mr Cohaagen.</i>

32:54.626 --> 32:57.166
- Richter here. Patch it through.
- <i>You're on, Mr Cohaagen.</i>

32:57.334 --> 33:00.750
- <i>What the fuck is going on?</i>
- I'm trying to neutralise a traitor, sir.

33:00.917 --> 33:03.458
<i>If I wanted him dead, you moron,
I wouldn't have dumped him on Earth.</i>

33:03.626 --> 33:05.791
We can't let him run around.
He knows too much.

33:07.459 --> 33:09.291
<i>Lori says he can't remember jack shit.</i>

33:09.459 --> 33:11.916
That's now. In an hour
he could have total recall.

33:12.084 --> 33:16.625
<i>Listen to me, Richter. I want Quaid
delivered alive for re-implantation.</i>

33:16.792 --> 33:18.375
<i>Have you got that?</i>

33:18.542 --> 33:21.083
<i>I want him back in place with Lori.</i>

33:22.834 --> 33:24.958
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

33:25.126 --> 33:26.833
What was that, sir?
I couldn't hear you.

33:27.001 --> 33:29.875
- <i>Richter, what are you doing?</i>
- I got Quaid again.

33:30.042 --> 33:32.750
Switching to another channel, sir.
I've got sunspots.

33:34.542 --> 33:37.250
- <i>Call him back! Call him back!</i>
- I'm losing you.

33:37.417 --> 33:40.291
- Where is he?
- Second level, galleria.

33:40.459 --> 33:42.583
We should've killed Quaid on Mars.

34:07.751 --> 34:09.166
- How we doing?
- Fine.

34:12.376 --> 34:15.083
Zooming in... We got him!

34:36.583 --> 34:38.541
<i>If you want to live, don't hang up.</i>

34:38.708 --> 34:40.583
- What do you want?
- <i>They've got you bugged.</i>

34:40.751 --> 34:42.458
<i>They'll be busting down your door
in about three minutes</i>

34:42.626 --> 34:44.875
<i>unless you do exactly what I say.</i>

34:45.042 --> 34:48.291
<i>Don't bother searching.
The bug's in your skull.</i>

34:50.958 --> 34:52.875
- Who are you?
- <i>Never mind.</i>

34:53.042 --> 34:55.833
<i>Wet a towel and wrap it around
your head. That'll muffle the signal.</i>

34:56.001 --> 34:58.958
- How'd you find me?
- <i>I'd advise you to hurry.</i>

35:01.751 --> 35:05.166
<i>This'll buy you some time.
They won't be able to pinpoint you.</i>

35:12.626 --> 35:14.083
Shit!

35:14.251 --> 35:16.500
- What?
- I lost him.

35:16.959 --> 35:19.458
- Well, find him!
- Yeah, right.

35:19.626 --> 35:22.000
<i>Come on. Hurry up.
You look beautiful.</i>

35:24.542 --> 35:27.625
<i>Now go to the window. Go.</i>

35:30.667 --> 35:32.958
- <i>Can you see me down here?</i>
- Mm-hm.

35:33.126 --> 35:36.083
- <i>This is the suitcase you gave me.</i>
- I gave you?

35:36.251 --> 35:39.625
<i>I'm gonna set it here.
You come and get it, keep moving.</i>

35:39.792 --> 35:41.833
- Wait. Wait.
- <i>What?</i>

35:42.001 --> 35:45.500
- Who are you?
- <i>We were buddies in the Agency.</i>

35:45.667 --> 35:48.916
<i>You asked me, if you disappeared,
to find you, so here I am.</i>

35:49.084 --> 35:51.500
What was I doing on Mars? Damn!

35:56.042 --> 35:57.791
Excuse me, ma'am, but this is mine.

35:57.959 --> 36:01.125
- I don't see your name on it.
- Someone left it for me.

36:01.292 --> 36:04.125
- Find your own bag.
- Excuse me, ma'am, but I need it!

36:05.459 --> 36:07.041
Fuck you, you asshole!

36:16.751 --> 36:18.500
Son of a bitch gotta be here
somewhere.

36:22.292 --> 36:24.750
That guy there.

36:33.459 --> 36:36.833
Hello, I'm Johnnycab.
Where can I take you tonight?

36:38.376 --> 36:40.583
Drive. Drive!

36:40.751 --> 36:44.166
- Please repeat the destination.
- Anywhere! Just go! Go! Go!

36:44.334 --> 36:45.916
Please state the street
and number.

36:46.084 --> 36:48.125
Shit. Shit!

36:48.292 --> 36:52.000
I'm not familiar with that address.
Would you please repeat...?

36:59.501 --> 37:01.125
Fasten your seat belt!

37:34.834 --> 37:36.583
The fare is 18 credits, please.

37:36.751 --> 37:38.083
Sue me, dickhead.

37:38.251 --> 37:39.416
Ah!

37:48.209 --> 37:50.625
We hope you enjoyed the ride.

39:09.209 --> 39:10.291
Hmm.

39:25.584 --> 39:27.958
<i>Howdy, stranger.
This is Hauser.</i>

39:29.126 --> 39:31.541
<i>If things have gone wrong,
I'm talking to myself</i>

39:31.709 --> 39:34.541
<i>and you've got a wet towel
wrapped around your head.</i>

39:34.709 --> 39:38.458
<i>Now, whatever your name is,
get ready for the big surprise.</i>

39:39.626 --> 39:42.666
<i>You are not you. You are me.</i>

39:43.709 --> 39:45.291
No shit.

39:47.084 --> 39:49.916
<i>Six-beta-nine, six-beta-nine,
come in.</i>

39:50.084 --> 39:51.250
Did you find him?

39:51.417 --> 39:54.166
<i>We picked up an explosion
at the old cement factory.</i>

39:55.251 --> 39:57.875
- Send two units. We'll meet you there.
- <i>Roger.</i>

40:02.334 --> 40:05.000
<i>All my life I've worked
for Mars Intelligence.</i>

40:05.167 --> 40:07.375
<i>I did Cohaagen's dirty work.</i>

40:07.542 --> 40:10.375
<i>But a few weeks ago
I met somebody, a woman,</i>

40:10.542 --> 40:12.541
<i>and I learned a few things.</i>

40:12.709 --> 40:15.291
<i>Like I've been playing
for the wrong team.</i>

40:16.584 --> 40:19.666
<i>All I can do now is try
to make up for it.</i>

40:20.459 --> 40:23.791
<i>There's enough shit in here
to fuck Cohaagen good.</i>

40:23.959 --> 40:28.000
<i>Unfortunately, if you're listening to
this, that means he has got to me first.</i>

40:28.959 --> 40:30.708
<i>Here comes the hard part,
old buddy.</i>

40:30.876 --> 40:33.000
<i>Now it is all up to you.</i>

40:33.167 --> 40:34.375
Great.

40:46.251 --> 40:48.041
- What have we got?
- Nothing here.

40:48.209 --> 40:50.458
- He's gone.
- I got a weak signal over there.

40:50.626 --> 40:52.041
Split up. Find him.

40:52.209 --> 40:55.125
<i>First let's get rid
of that bug in your head.</i>

40:55.292 --> 40:58.958
<i>Take this thing out of the case
and stick it up your nose.</i>

40:59.126 --> 41:01.166
<i>Don't worry. it's self-guiding.</i>

41:07.084 --> 41:09.125
<i>Just shove real hard.</i>

41:15.084 --> 41:16.833
<i>When it crunches, you're there.</i>

41:18.417 --> 41:20.208
<i>Just pull it out.</i>

41:20.376 --> 41:22.541
<i>Be careful. It's my head too.</i>

41:22.709 --> 41:25.333
Ah! Ah!

41:44.584 --> 41:48.291
- I've got a lock.
- Up. Let's go.

41:50.126 --> 41:51.875
<i>This is the plan.</i>

41:52.042 --> 41:53.500
<i>Get your ass to Mars,</i>

41:53.667 --> 41:56.875
<i>then go to the Hilton and flash
the Brubaker ID at the desk.</i>

41:57.042 --> 41:58.750
<i>That's all there's to it.</i>

41:58.917 --> 42:00.541
<i>Just do what I tell you.</i>

42:00.709 --> 42:04.666
<i>And we can nail that son of the bitch
who fucked you and me.</i>

42:04.834 --> 42:06.750
<i>I'm counting on you, buddy.</i>

42:06.917 --> 42:08.583
<i>Don't let me down.</i>

42:37.376 --> 42:38.583
Straight ahead.

42:42.667 --> 42:44.250
In there.

42:52.542 --> 42:54.041
There!

42:59.459 --> 43:01.041
There!

43:04.042 --> 43:05.458
There!

43:11.126 --> 43:13.250
What? Give me that.

43:13.417 --> 43:15.500
<i>Get your ass to Mars.</i>

43:17.376 --> 43:19.875
- <i>Get your ass to Mars.</i>
- Shit.

43:21.459 --> 43:26.541
<i>Get your ass to Mars...
Get your ass to Mars...</i>

43:58.417 --> 44:00.875
<i>Welcome to the Mars
Federal Colony.</i>

44:01.042 --> 44:03.791
<i>For your safety and comfort,
domes have been installed</i>

44:03.959 --> 44:06.416
<i>to protect you
from the vacuum outside.</i>

44:06.584 --> 44:10.333
<i>Please do not touch
exterior windows or air locks.</i>

44:10.501 --> 44:14.291
<i>Air volume is limited. No smoking
is allowed anywhere in the colony.</i>

44:14.459 --> 44:15.791
Next.

44:15.959 --> 44:20.166
<i>Thank you,
and enjoy your stay on Mars.</i>

44:20.334 --> 44:21.875
Passport.

44:33.376 --> 44:34.625
Hmm?

44:34.792 --> 44:38.541
Get out of the way.
Make way! Stand back!

44:44.792 --> 44:47.583
Mr Cohaagen wants to see you
right away.

44:48.584 --> 44:50.125
Any news of Quaid?

44:50.292 --> 44:53.250
- Not since you lost him.
- Watch your mouth, Captain...

44:54.334 --> 44:57.333
- So how long do you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

44:57.917 --> 45:00.208
Look at that shit.

45:00.376 --> 45:03.875
- What the hell's this?
- The Martians love Kuato.

45:04.042 --> 45:06.041
They think he's fuckin'
George Washington.

45:06.209 --> 45:07.833
Kill the bastard.

45:08.001 --> 45:09.583
Nobody knows who he is.

45:11.251 --> 45:13.541
Have you brought
any fruits or vegetables?

45:13.709 --> 45:15.458
Two weeks.

45:16.751 --> 45:18.125
Excuse me?

45:18.292 --> 45:20.750
Two weeks.

45:21.917 --> 45:24.166
Two weeks!

45:27.917 --> 45:32.625
It's not just graffiti. The rebels
took over the refinery last night.

45:32.792 --> 45:34.708
No terbinium is going out.

45:34.876 --> 45:36.375
And it gets worse.

45:36.542 --> 45:38.583
T-w-o...

45:56.917 --> 45:58.250
Quaid.

45:59.417 --> 46:01.000
- That's Quaid!
- Where?

46:01.167 --> 46:02.875
The woman!
Get him... her!

46:03.876 --> 46:05.333
Arrest that woman!

46:05.501 --> 46:07.000
Get that woman. Grab her!

46:36.751 --> 46:37.833
Catch!

46:40.084 --> 46:42.125
Get ready for a surprise!

47:27.834 --> 47:28.958
Ah!

47:53.292 --> 47:54.958
- Open the goddamn door!
- I can't!

47:55.126 --> 47:56.333
Open it!

47:56.501 --> 47:58.291
They're all connected!

48:07.584 --> 48:08.916
That's terrible.

48:09.084 --> 48:11.000
A few days ago
Cohaagen raised the price of air.

48:11.167 --> 48:12.333
Again?

48:12.501 --> 48:14.791
Nobody on Earth gives a damn
what happens up here.

48:14.959 --> 48:17.416
They just want our terbinium
so they can fight their war.

48:17.584 --> 48:19.500
Excuse me. What's that?

48:19.667 --> 48:21.708
You mean the Pyramid Mine?

48:21.876 --> 48:25.333
I used to work there until
they found that alien shit inside.

48:25.501 --> 48:27.333
Well, that's a rumour, isn't it?

48:28.001 --> 48:29.250
Think so?

48:58.876 --> 49:00.291
Mr Cohaagen.

49:07.792 --> 49:09.708
You wanted to see me, sir?

49:13.292 --> 49:14.708
Richter...

49:16.001 --> 49:17.958
Do you know why
I'm such a happy person?

49:18.126 --> 49:19.458
No, sir.

49:21.584 --> 49:24.833
Because I've got the greatest job
in the solar system.

49:25.001 --> 49:28.375
As long as the terbinium keeps flowing,
I can do anything I want.

49:29.209 --> 49:30.791
Anything.

49:32.209 --> 49:35.291
In fact, the only thing
that I ever worry about

49:35.459 --> 49:40.791
is that one day, if the rebels win,
it all might end...

49:42.042 --> 49:43.541
and you're fucking making it happen!

49:44.709 --> 49:47.583
First you try to kill Quaid,
then you let him get away.

49:47.751 --> 49:50.000
He had help from our side, sir.

49:51.084 --> 49:52.250
I know that.

49:54.584 --> 49:56.625
- But I thought...
- Who told you to think?

49:56.792 --> 49:59.791
I don't give you enough information
to think.

50:01.917 --> 50:05.000
You do what you're told.
That's what you do.

50:07.459 --> 50:08.875
Yes, sir.

50:09.584 --> 50:11.500
Now...

50:13.792 --> 50:15.416
Let's get to business.

50:17.167 --> 50:19.458
We've got a tricky situation here.

50:19.626 --> 50:21.833
Kuato wants what's in Quaid's head.

50:23.584 --> 50:26.625
And he might be able to get it,
cos they say he's psychic.

50:28.167 --> 50:31.208
And I have a plan
to keep this from happening.

50:34.709 --> 50:36.250
Do you think you could play along?

50:36.417 --> 50:38.458
- Yes, sir.
- Great.

50:38.626 --> 50:41.000
Cos otherwise, I'll erase your ass.

50:55.834 --> 50:59.208
You've got some
identification? Yeah, you too.

50:59.376 --> 51:03.291
Taxi? You need a taxi, sir?
I got magazines, music, whisky.

51:03.459 --> 51:06.000
Hey, man, you need a cab, man?
Come on! Come on!

51:31.042 --> 51:32.750
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

51:32.917 --> 51:35.333
Yes, I would like
to have a room, please.

51:40.876 --> 51:43.416
Nice to have you back, Mr Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?

51:43.584 --> 51:45.250
Oh, definitely.

51:47.251 --> 51:49.375
Seems you've left something
in our safe.

51:49.542 --> 51:51.208
Could you get it, please?

51:56.584 --> 51:58.208
Identification?

52:07.667 --> 52:10.291
- I'll encode your room key.
- Thank you.

52:26.376 --> 52:29.833
- Suite 610 in the east wing.
- Thank you.

52:30.001 --> 52:32.583
- Could I borrow your pen, please?
- Certainly.

52:44.334 --> 52:45.458
Thank you.

52:50.834 --> 52:53.208
Hey, man, you need a cab?

52:53.376 --> 52:57.750
- What's wrong with this one?
- He ain't got five kids to feed.

52:57.917 --> 53:01.041
- Where's yours?
- Right over there, man.

53:01.209 --> 53:03.291
Hey! Hey, man.

53:03.459 --> 53:05.291
Hey, asshole! That's my fare!

53:05.459 --> 53:08.125
- Eat this!
- Damn you, Benny!

53:14.459 --> 53:16.000
Welcome to Mars, man!

53:20.167 --> 53:21.750
What the hell was that, an accident?

53:21.917 --> 53:25.208
That's the rebels, man.
Let's get outta here...

53:25.376 --> 53:27.166
Before they arrest us!

53:27.334 --> 53:29.041
What do the rebels want?

53:29.209 --> 53:32.666
The usual.
More money, more freedom, more air.

53:37.751 --> 53:38.916
So, where to?

53:39.084 --> 53:40.791
Last Resort.

53:40.959 --> 53:42.875
You're getting off to an early start.

53:43.917 --> 53:46.125
- First time on Mars?
- Yes.

53:46.292 --> 53:49.541
Well, actually, no. Well, sort of.

53:49.709 --> 53:53.875
The man don't even know
whether he's been to Mars or not.

54:04.417 --> 54:06.791
Voila. Venusville.

54:06.959 --> 54:10.291
Ha, ha!
Hey, you see anything you like?

54:14.501 --> 54:17.583
Well, this is the end of the line.
We'd better walk from here.

54:17.751 --> 54:19.666
I'll show you where.

54:19.834 --> 54:23.375
- Do you want to know the future?
- What about the past?

54:23.542 --> 54:27.208
Come on. It's around the corner,
right down this alley.

54:27.376 --> 54:29.416
They got everything.

54:32.084 --> 54:33.750
Not bad, huh?

54:35.417 --> 54:39.791
Read your palm? Your mind? Your aura?
Probe the secrets of your heart?

54:39.959 --> 54:42.083
I bet I can guess your birthday.

54:42.251 --> 54:45.208
- You're a Taurus, right?
- How did you guess?

54:47.876 --> 54:50.083
- Tell me, are all psychics...?
- Freaks?

54:50.251 --> 54:52.208
Afraid so, man.
It goes with the territory.

54:52.376 --> 54:57.333
- What happened to them?
- Cheap domes, no air to clean the rays.

54:57.501 --> 55:01.375
So, this is it. The Last Resort.
You sure you want to go in here?

55:01.542 --> 55:04.875
- Why not?
- There's a better place down there.

55:05.042 --> 55:07.708
The girls are cleaner,
the liquor ain't watered down...

55:07.876 --> 55:10.208
Sure, and you get kickbacks.

55:10.376 --> 55:13.208
Hey, man, I got five kids to feed.

55:13.376 --> 55:14.916
Take them to the dentist.

55:15.084 --> 55:17.583
Hey, thanks, mister!
I'll be waiting for you.

55:17.751 --> 55:19.875
You just take your time.
Benny's the name.

55:40.126 --> 55:42.083
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for Melina.

55:42.251 --> 55:43.958
She's busy.

55:44.126 --> 55:45.958
But Mary here, she's free.

55:46.709 --> 55:49.416
Well, not free, honey, but...

55:50.209 --> 55:51.625
...available.

55:52.501 --> 55:54.375
Ha-ha-ha!

55:54.542 --> 55:56.833
Thanks. I'll wait for Melina.

55:57.001 --> 55:58.125
Earth slime.

55:58.292 --> 56:00.875
Thing is, friend, Mel's real picky.

56:01.042 --> 56:03.250
She kind of sticks to her regulars.

56:03.417 --> 56:05.416
She'll like me.

56:06.417 --> 56:07.625
Mel!

56:07.792 --> 56:09.291
Hey, Mel!

56:45.376 --> 56:46.916
Hello, Hauser.

56:47.917 --> 56:49.583
Still bulging, I see.

56:51.167 --> 56:54.375
- What you been feeding this thing?
- Blondes.

56:56.209 --> 56:58.375
I think it's still hungry.

57:00.709 --> 57:03.625
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here, Hauser.

57:03.792 --> 57:05.708
Look who's talking.

57:05.876 --> 57:08.583
Hey, Tony,
give the big guy a break.

57:08.751 --> 57:11.000
Relax. You'll live longer.

57:11.167 --> 57:12.916
Come on.

57:18.209 --> 57:21.166
- Honey, take care of Tony, will you?
- No problem.

57:21.876 --> 57:24.875
If you need any help with this one,
give me a holler.

57:39.917 --> 57:41.708
You son of a bitch.

57:41.876 --> 57:44.541
You're alive? I thought that
Cohaagen tortured you to death.

57:44.709 --> 57:46.500
Well, I guess he didn't.

57:46.667 --> 57:50.416
And you couldn't get me a message? You
never wondered what happened to me?

57:58.001 --> 58:00.333
Hauser, thank God you're alive.

58:01.417 --> 58:03.833
Melin... Melina. Melina.

58:04.667 --> 58:08.583
- Melina, I have to tell you something.
- What?

58:08.751 --> 58:12.291
- I don't remember you.
- What are you talking about?

58:12.459 --> 58:14.541
I don't remember you.

58:14.709 --> 58:18.041
I don't remember us.
I don't even remember me.

58:20.209 --> 58:22.500
Did you get amnesia?
How did you get here?

58:22.667 --> 58:24.958
- Hauser left me a note.
- Hauser? You're Hauser.

58:25.126 --> 58:27.000
Not anymore.

58:27.167 --> 58:30.166
Now I'm Quaid. Douglas Quaid.

58:33.417 --> 58:37.416
- Hauser, you've lost your mind.
- I didn't. Cohaagen stole it.

58:37.584 --> 58:42.041
He found out that Hauser switched sides,
so he turned him into somebody else: me.

58:42.209 --> 58:43.583
This is too weird.

58:43.751 --> 58:46.166
He dumped me on earth
with a wife and a lousy job...

58:46.334 --> 58:49.166
Did you say wife?
Are you fucking married?

58:49.334 --> 58:51.291
- She wasn't really my wife.
- Oh, she isn't?

58:51.459 --> 58:53.708
How stupid of me.
She was Hauser's wife?

58:53.876 --> 58:56.875
- Look. Forget that I said wife.
- Let's just forget everything.

58:57.042 --> 59:00.541
- I'm sick of hearing your goddamn lies.
- Why would I lie to you?

59:01.709 --> 59:05.000
Because you're still
working for Cohaagen.

59:05.167 --> 59:07.583
Don't be ridiculous.

59:10.459 --> 59:12.500
You never loved me, Hauser.

59:12.667 --> 59:14.583
You just used me to get inside.

59:14.751 --> 59:16.708
Inside what?

59:20.792 --> 59:22.791
I think you'd better leave.

59:22.959 --> 59:26.041
- Hauser sent me to do something.
- I'm not falling for it.

59:26.209 --> 59:28.375
He says there's enough in here
to nail Cohaagen for good.

59:28.542 --> 59:30.375
- Get out!
- You've got to help me remember!

59:30.542 --> 59:32.666
- I said, get out!
- Melina, please!

59:32.834 --> 59:34.625
People are trying to kill me.

59:35.501 --> 59:37.125
Really?

59:39.501 --> 59:41.541
All right, I'm leaving.

59:53.334 --> 59:56.375
Baby, you make me wish
I had three hands.

59:56.542 --> 59:59.208
I think you're doing
just fine with two.

59:59.376 --> 01:00:01.666
Excuse me, baby.
We'll pick this up later.

01:00:01.834 --> 01:00:04.166
Hey, that didn't take long.

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.833
Listen. Let me ask you a question.
Did you ever fuck a mutant?

01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:09.375
- Take me to the hotel.
- I know these Siamese twins.

01:00:09.542 --> 01:00:12.333
Man, you won't know
if you're coming or going.

01:00:21.917 --> 01:00:22.208
<i>This afternoon at 4:30 p.m.,
I signed an order declaring martial law</i>

01:00:22.209 --> 01:00:25.583
<i>This afternoon at 4:30 p.m.,
I signed an order declaring martial law</i>

01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.833
<i>throughout the Mars federal colony.</i>

01:00:28.001 --> 01:00:32.750
<i>I will not tolerate any further damage
to our mineral export operations.</i>

01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:34.916
<i>Mr Kuato and his terrorists
must understand</i>

01:00:35.084 --> 01:00:38.708
<i>that their self-defeating efforts
will only bring misery and suffering...</i>

01:00:42.334 --> 01:00:45.166
- Mr Quaid?
- What?

01:00:45.334 --> 01:00:47.833
I need to talk to you
about Mr Hauser.

01:00:49.042 --> 01:00:51.250
- Who are you?
- Dr Edgemar from Rekall.

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:53.583
- How did you find me?
- It's difficult to explain.

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.833
Could you open the door?
I'm unarmed.

01:00:58.876 --> 01:01:01.208
Don't worry. I'm alone.
May I come in?

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:04.333
What do you want?

01:01:04.501 --> 01:01:06.750
This is going to be very difficult
for you to accept, Mr Quaid.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:11.875
- I'm listening.
- You're not really standing here now.

01:01:12.042 --> 01:01:15.041
- Doc, you could have fooled me.
- I'm quite serious.

01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:18.291
You're not here and neither am I.

01:01:18.459 --> 01:01:19.791
That's amazing.

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:22.583
- Where are we?
- At Rekall.

01:01:23.209 --> 01:01:24.791
You're strapped into
an implant chair,

01:01:24.959 --> 01:01:28.208
and I'm monitoring you
from the psychoprobe console.

01:01:29.209 --> 01:01:31.625
Ah, I get it. I'm dreaming.

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:35.000
And all this is part of the delightful
vacation your company has sold me.

01:01:35.167 --> 01:01:36.500
Not exactly.

01:01:36.667 --> 01:01:40.750
What you're experiencing is a free-form
delusion based on our memory tapes

01:01:40.917 --> 01:01:43.875
but you're inventing it yourself
as you go along.

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:48.375
If it is my delusion,
who the hell invited you?

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:52.166
I've been artificially implanted
as an emergency measure.

01:01:52.334 --> 01:01:55.666
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but you've suffered a schizoid embolism.

01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:58.041
We can't snap you
out of your fantasy,

01:01:58.209 --> 01:02:01.333
and I've been sent in
to try to talk you down.

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:03.250
How much is Cohaagen
paying you for this?

01:02:04.751 --> 01:02:08.875
Think about it. Your dream started
in the middle of the implant procedure.

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:11.250
Everything after that,
the chases, the trip to Mars,

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:15.875
the suite at the Hilton, are elements
of your Rekall Holiday and Ego Trip.

01:02:16.042 --> 01:02:18.333
You paid to be a secret agent.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.916
Bullshit. It's coincidence.

01:02:21.084 --> 01:02:23.750
And what about the girl?

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:26.458
Brunette, athletic,
sleazy and demure?

01:02:26.626 --> 01:02:29.000
Just as you specified.
Is that coincidence?

01:02:29.167 --> 01:02:32.708
She's real. I dreamt about her
before I even went to Rekall.

01:02:32.876 --> 01:02:34.833
Ha, Mr Quaid.

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:39.000
Can you hear yourself?
She's real because you dreamed her?

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:42.083
- That's right.
- Maybe this will convince you.

01:02:42.251 --> 01:02:44.625
Would you mind opening the door?

01:02:46.626 --> 01:02:51.083
- You open it.
- No need to be rude. I'll do it.

01:02:57.501 --> 01:02:58.750
Sweetheart?

01:03:01.292 --> 01:03:03.708
Come in, Mrs Quaid.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:12.208
- I suppose you're not here either.
- I'm here... at Rekall.

01:03:16.917 --> 01:03:18.625
I love you.

01:03:18.792 --> 01:03:22.041
Right.
That's why you tried to kill me.

01:03:22.209 --> 01:03:25.250
No. I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

01:03:26.251 --> 01:03:28.500
I want you to come back to me.

01:03:30.792 --> 01:03:33.958
- Bullshit.
- What's bullshit, Mr Quaid?

01:03:34.126 --> 01:03:35.958
That you're having
a paranoid episode

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:38.708
triggered by acute
neurochemical trauma?

01:03:38.876 --> 01:03:42.750
Or that you're really an invincible
secret agent from Mars,

01:03:42.917 --> 01:03:46.958
who's the victim of an interplanetary
conspiracy to make him think

01:03:47.126 --> 01:03:49.041
he's a lowly construction worker?

01:03:56.626 --> 01:03:58.833
Stop punishing yourself, Doug.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.916
You're a fine, upstanding man.
You have a beautiful wife who loves you.

01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:05.416
- Your whole life is ahead of you.
- I do.

01:04:07.459 --> 01:04:10.041
But you've got to want
to return to reality.

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:15.000
Let's assume I do. Then what?

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:20.958
- Swallow this.
- What is it?

01:04:21.126 --> 01:04:24.333
It's a symbol of your desire
to return to reality.

01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:27.833
Inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.

01:04:31.459 --> 01:04:36.125
All right, let's say you're telling
the truth and this is all a dream.

01:04:36.292 --> 01:04:38.250
Then I could pull this trigger
and it won't matter.

01:04:38.417 --> 01:04:41.375
- Doug, don't.
- It won't make a difference to me.

01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:45.958
But the consequences to you would be
devastating. In your mind I'll be dead.

01:04:46.126 --> 01:04:49.416
With no one to guide you out,
you'll be stuck in permanent psychosis.

01:04:49.584 --> 01:04:51.791
Doug, let Dr Edgemar help you.

01:04:51.959 --> 01:04:54.041
The walls of reality
will come crashing down.

01:04:54.209 --> 01:04:56.375
One minute you'll be
the saviour of the rebel cause,

01:04:56.542 --> 01:05:00.000
and the next thing you know
you'll be Cohaagen's bosom buddy.

01:05:00.167 --> 01:05:04.083
You'll even have fantasies about
alien civilisations, as you requested,

01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:06.875
but in the end, back on earth
you'll be lobotomised!

01:05:09.417 --> 01:05:13.333
So get a grip on yourself, Doug,
and put down that gun!

01:05:19.001 --> 01:05:22.500
Good. Now take the pill
and put it in your mouth.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:28.916
Swallow it!

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:33.958
Go ahead, sweetheart.

01:05:56.667 --> 01:06:00.000
Now you've done it.
Now you've done it!

01:06:14.667 --> 01:06:16.000
Ah!

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:20.625
Aargh!

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:23.291
That's for making me come to Mars.

01:06:24.584 --> 01:06:28.000
You know how much I hate
this fucking planet!

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:31.125
Cuff him.

01:06:37.834 --> 01:06:41.208
- <i>I got him.</i>
- Bring him down in the service elevator.

01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:44.916
Let's go.

01:07:58.209 --> 01:07:59.333
Fuck you!

01:08:09.917 --> 01:08:11.125
Doug.

01:08:13.126 --> 01:08:15.166
Honey...

01:08:15.334 --> 01:08:17.791
You wouldn't hurt me,
would you, sweetheart?

01:08:19.584 --> 01:08:22.832
Sweetheart, be reasonable.

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:25.125
After all, we're married.

01:08:30.542 --> 01:08:32.041
Consider that a divorce.

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.166
That was your wife?

01:08:40.209 --> 01:08:41.625
What a bitch.

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.832
Hey, get out of the way!

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:56.832
I thought you didn't like me.

01:08:57.001 --> 01:08:59.625
If Cohaagen wants you dead,
you might be OK.

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:03.166
- Got it.
- So you've come back to apologise.

01:09:03.334 --> 01:09:05.000
Kuato wants to see you.

01:09:07.084 --> 01:09:08.625
Come on.

01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:38.500
- Now what?
- Jump!

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:44.000
Ah!

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:12.000
No! Don't do it!
You'll crack the fucking dome!

01:10:15.501 --> 01:10:18.708
What are you trying to do, kill us?
The dome will crack!

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.541
- Move!
- Hey!

01:10:34.084 --> 01:10:36.000
Taxi!

01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:39.000
Melina! Melina!

01:10:42.126 --> 01:10:43.541
- Need a ride?
- Last Resort. Quick!

01:10:43.709 --> 01:10:45.166
You guys are going in circles.

01:10:50.209 --> 01:10:51.125
Jesus!

01:10:51.292 --> 01:10:53.416
Come on! You drive!

01:10:53.584 --> 01:10:54.625
You guys are in trouble?

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.500
Go! Go!

01:11:07.292 --> 01:11:10.125
- What are you trying to do to me?
- Shut up and drive!

01:11:10.292 --> 01:11:12.500
Hey, I got five kids to feed!

01:11:28.459 --> 01:11:30.208
Aargh!

01:11:46.584 --> 01:11:47.625
Shit!

01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:49.500
- No brakes! Ah!
- Stop it!

01:11:49.667 --> 01:11:51.291
You idiot!

01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:55.708
What are you doing?

01:12:08.292 --> 01:12:11.000
Oh, Christ! Now they're after me!

01:12:12.292 --> 01:12:13.500
Give me that!

01:12:13.667 --> 01:12:15.625
Get out of the way!

01:12:17.751 --> 01:12:19.208
Hey!

01:12:22.126 --> 01:12:23.541
Tony!

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:29.625
Get out of the way!
Come on!

01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:32.166
Come on! Come on!

01:12:32.334 --> 01:12:33.583
Quick!

01:12:35.542 --> 01:12:36.916
- Thank you, Tony.
- Uh-um.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:04.000
Hey! You wanna have some fun?

01:13:04.167 --> 01:13:05.291
Where are they?

01:13:05.459 --> 01:13:07.916
What are you talking about?
I don't know.

01:13:16.376 --> 01:13:17.875
Maybe you know.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:26.541
Kill them all!

01:13:37.876 --> 01:13:39.250
Ah!

01:13:40.626 --> 01:13:42.125
Thumbelina!

01:14:06.876 --> 01:14:08.333
Richter!

01:14:08.501 --> 01:14:11.833
- A call from Cohaagen!
- Richter here.

01:14:12.001 --> 01:14:14.666
- We've got them pinned down.
- <i>Stop fighting and pull out.</i>

01:14:14.834 --> 01:14:16.708
But they've got Quaid.
They're protecting him.

01:14:18.001 --> 01:14:21.083
<i>Perfect.
Get out of Sector G now.</i>

01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:22.708
<i>Don't think.</i>

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:25.291
- <i>Do it!</i>
- Yes, sir.

01:14:25.459 --> 01:14:27.291
Pull 'em out.

01:14:27.459 --> 01:14:29.750
Everybody, pull out!

01:14:29.917 --> 01:14:31.458
Move!

01:14:40.292 --> 01:14:43.416
- Cohaagen's sealing off the area!
- Come on, Benny!

01:15:45.126 --> 01:15:46.875
The first settlers are buried here.

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:51.000
They worked themselves to death, but
Cohaagen ended up with all the money.

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:53.750
He built cheap domes and
watched the kids turn into freaks.

01:15:53.917 --> 01:15:55.083
I saw them.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.875
And if you want to breathe,
you have to buy his air.

01:15:58.042 --> 01:15:59.625
Maybe you can change all that.

01:16:00.417 --> 01:16:03.875
Hey, I think my grandpa might be here.

01:16:04.042 --> 01:16:05.625
So what can I do?

01:16:05.792 --> 01:16:08.458
Kuato's gonna make you remember some
things you knew when you were Hauser.

01:16:08.626 --> 01:16:11.125
- Like what?
- All sorts of things.

01:16:11.292 --> 01:16:14.250
- Maybe you'll remember you loved me.
- I don't need Kuato for that.

01:16:15.542 --> 01:16:17.458
Since when?

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:28.875
Freeze!

01:16:29.042 --> 01:16:30.708
Come on, Melina.

01:16:32.001 --> 01:16:33.291
Kuato's waiting.

01:16:33.459 --> 01:16:35.833
I didn't find Grandpa, but...

01:16:36.917 --> 01:16:38.375
Oh, shit.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:41.625
- Who's this?
- He helped us get away.

01:16:41.792 --> 01:16:45.958
Hey, don't worry about me, man.
I'm on your side.

01:16:56.501 --> 01:16:58.416
You're a mutant, huh?

01:16:58.584 --> 01:17:00.833
All right, let's go.

01:17:16.042 --> 01:17:18.750
- Have you tried ramming down the door?
- You wait here. Follow me.

01:17:18.917 --> 01:17:20.625
<i>It won't do any good.</i>

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:24.083
- <i>Cohaagen depressurised the tunnels.</i>
- Then drill through to Section M.

01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:27.125
<i>We can't.
We're running out of air.</i>

01:17:27.292 --> 01:17:29.291
<i>We need help.</i>

01:17:29.459 --> 01:17:32.083
Sit tight.
Melina just got here with Quaid.

01:17:33.126 --> 01:17:34.833
<i>I hope he was worth it.</i>

01:17:35.001 --> 01:17:36.833
So do I.

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:40.875
- I'm glad you made it.
- You don't look glad.

01:17:41.042 --> 01:17:44.250
Cohaagen sealed up Venusville.
He shut off the air.

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:46.500
You must know something
pretty important, Quaid.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:48.666
He wants you.

01:17:48.834 --> 01:17:52.166
If we don't hand you over, everybody
in this sector will be dead by morning.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:54.166
Then we don't have much choice.
Do we?

01:17:54.334 --> 01:17:55.875
We can't turn him in.

01:17:57.167 --> 01:17:59.500
That's up to Kuato.
Come with me, Quaid.

01:18:13.626 --> 01:18:15.666
Sit down.

01:18:15.834 --> 01:18:18.125
- Where's Kuato?
- On his way.

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.166
You heard the rumours
about the Pyramid Mine?

01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:23.125
Yeah.

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:26.541
Cohaagen found something weird inside
and it's got him scared shitless.

01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:28.958
What? Aliens?

01:18:30.584 --> 01:18:33.291
- You tell me.
- I don't know.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.916
Yes, you do.
That's why we brought you here.

01:18:36.084 --> 01:18:38.625
Cohaagen's big secret
is buried in that black hole

01:18:38.792 --> 01:18:40.833
you call a brain.

01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:45.250
And Kuato's gonna dig it out.

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:48.166
- You're Kuato, right?
- Wrong.

01:18:48.959 --> 01:18:52.833
Kuato's a mutant,
so don't get upset when you see him.

01:18:57.459 --> 01:18:59.291
Ah!

01:19:31.376 --> 01:19:33.458
What do you want, Mr Quaid?

01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.250
The same as you. To remember.

01:19:36.417 --> 01:19:38.583
But why?

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:42.458
- To be myself again.
- You are what you do.

01:19:45.876 --> 01:19:49.083
A man is defined by his actions...

01:19:49.251 --> 01:19:51.375
not his memory.

01:19:52.542 --> 01:19:55.583
Please take my hands.

01:19:57.834 --> 01:19:59.666
Ah!

01:20:01.334 --> 01:20:03.791
Now open your mind to me.

01:20:04.917 --> 01:20:06.791
Please.

01:20:09.126 --> 01:20:11.833
Open your mind.

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:16.375
Open your mind.

01:20:18.584 --> 01:20:22.250
Open your mind.

01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:27.375
Open your mind.

01:20:29.209 --> 01:20:32.833
Open your mind.

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:06.708
We should blow the thing up
before the rebels turn it on.

01:21:06.876 --> 01:21:09.166
I say we throw the switch
and see what happens.

01:21:09.334 --> 01:21:11.291
- Don't be an idiot.
- We can't risk it.

01:21:11.459 --> 01:21:14.291
The chain reaction could spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

01:21:14.459 --> 01:21:17.291
That means a meltdown,
a meltdown on a planetary scale.

01:21:17.459 --> 01:21:19.791
Don't you think whoever
built this thing thought of that?

01:21:19.959 --> 01:21:22.958
Who knows what the hell they thought?
They weren't human.

01:21:23.126 --> 01:21:25.583
Maybe it's a trap.
Maybe they want a meltdown.

01:21:25.751 --> 01:21:27.833
We don't even know
if this piece of junk will work.

01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:30.500
What is it?
A million? Half a million?

01:21:30.667 --> 01:21:33.625
- About half a million.
- Half a million years old.

01:21:33.792 --> 01:21:35.666
Let's make sure Kuato...

01:22:06.584 --> 01:22:09.916
Wake up! Wake up!
Come on, wake up!

01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:13.875
They found us! Shit! Let's go!

01:22:15.126 --> 01:22:17.750
Wake up! Snap out of it now!
Come on!

01:22:22.001 --> 01:22:24.833
- They found us! Everybody out!
- Melina!

01:22:25.001 --> 01:22:26.833
Get moving! Get out!

01:22:28.334 --> 01:22:30.000
Get out!

01:22:39.042 --> 01:22:41.083
Everybody out! Get out!

01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:49.041
Get to the air lock! Follow me!

01:22:50.834 --> 01:22:52.375
Benny, come on!

01:22:56.459 --> 01:22:59.125
- Benny!
- I'm coming!

01:23:11.251 --> 01:23:12.583
- Ah!
- This way!

01:23:18.292 --> 01:23:21.916
Put these spacesuits on!
We're going outside!

01:23:24.584 --> 01:23:26.583
Benny, hurry.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:38.208
Congratulations, Quaid.
You led us right to him.

01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:41.125
How can you do this?
You're a mutant.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:46.166
- I got four kids to feed.
- So what happened to number five?

01:23:48.084 --> 01:23:51.291
Oh, shit, man. You got me.

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.041
I ain't even married.

01:23:53.209 --> 01:23:55.333
Now put your fucking hands
in the air!

01:24:01.126 --> 01:24:03.125
Quaid.

01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:06.708
Quaid.

01:24:08.292 --> 01:24:11.875
Forget it, man.
His fortunetelling days are over.

01:24:14.584 --> 01:24:17.291
Start the reactor.

01:24:17.459 --> 01:24:19.291
Free Mars.

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:27.041
Mr Cohaagen
would like to talk to you.

01:24:35.042 --> 01:24:37.833
So this is the great man.

01:24:42.376 --> 01:24:44.500
No wonder he kept out of sight.

01:24:46.459 --> 01:24:48.666
Well, my boy...

01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:52.875
- You're a hero.
- Fuck you.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:56.708
Uh? Don't be modest.
Kuato is dead.

01:24:56.876 --> 01:25:01.083
The resistance is completely wiped out,
and you were the key to the whole thing.

01:25:01.251 --> 01:25:02.583
He's lying.

01:25:03.584 --> 01:25:06.250
You two-faced bastard.

01:25:07.251 --> 01:25:11.083
Ha, ha. You can't blame him, angel.
He's innocent.

01:25:12.959 --> 01:25:16.791
You see, Quaid, none of my people
could get close to Kuato.

01:25:17.376 --> 01:25:20.125
Fucking mutants
could always sniff us out.

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:24.375
So Hauser and I sat down
and invented you, the perfect mole.

01:25:24.542 --> 01:25:27.625
You know you're lying.
Hauser turned against you.

01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:33.458
That's what we wanted
you to think.

01:25:34.376 --> 01:25:37.541
The fact is, Hauser volunteered
to become Doug Quaid.

01:25:38.834 --> 01:25:40.666
It was the only way
to fool the psychics.

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:42.291
Get your story straight.

01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:45.875
This idiot here has been trying to kill me
ever since I went to Rekall.

01:25:46.042 --> 01:25:48.250
You don't kill somebody
you're trying to plant.

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:51.666
He wasn't in on it.
You set him off by going to Rekall.

01:25:52.417 --> 01:25:55.250
- So why am I still alive?
- We gave you lots of help.

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:57.208
- Benny here.
- My pleasure, man.

01:25:57.376 --> 01:26:00.875
The guy with the suitcase,
the mask, the money,

01:26:01.042 --> 01:26:04.875
the message from Hauser,
all of that was set up by us.

01:26:05.042 --> 01:26:07.458
Sorry. Too perfect.

01:26:07.626 --> 01:26:09.208
Perfect, my ass!

01:26:09.376 --> 01:26:11.958
You pop your memory cap
before we can activate you.

01:26:12.126 --> 01:26:16.083
Richter goes hog-wild, screwing up
everything I spent a year planning.

01:26:16.251 --> 01:26:20.000
Frankly, I'm amazed it worked.

01:26:20.167 --> 01:26:21.500
Well, Cohaagen,

01:26:21.667 --> 01:26:25.208
I have to hand it to you.
It's the best mind-fuck yet.

01:26:26.542 --> 01:26:29.208
Well, don't take my word for it.

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:36.166
- Someone you trust wants to talk to you.
- Who is it this time? My mother?

01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:39.583
<i>Howdy, Quaid.</i>

01:26:39.751 --> 01:26:43.208
<i>If you're listening to this,
it means that Kuato is dead</i>

01:26:43.376 --> 01:26:45.583
<i>and you have led us to him.</i>

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:47.708
<i>I knew you wouldn't let me down.</i>

01:26:47.876 --> 01:26:52.500
<i>Sorry for the shit I've put you through,
but hey, what are friends for?</i>

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:55.875
<i>I would like to wish you
happiness and long life, old buddy,</i>

01:26:56.042 --> 01:26:58.875
<i>but unfortunately,
this is not gonna happen.</i>

01:26:59.042 --> 01:27:03.208
<i>You see, it's my body
you've got there and I want it back.</i>

01:27:03.376 --> 01:27:07.500
<i>Sorry to be an Indian giver,
but I was here first.</i>

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:10.208
<i>So adios, amigo.</i>

01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:13.500
<i>And thanks for not
getting yourself killed.</i>

01:27:13.667 --> 01:27:16.250
<i>Hey, maybe we'll meet
in our dreams.</i>

01:27:19.876 --> 01:27:21.875
<i>You never know.</i>

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:28.666
You bastards!

01:27:46.751 --> 01:27:48.250
Let go of me!

01:28:04.376 --> 01:28:06.375
- Ready?
- Auto.

01:28:06.542 --> 01:28:09.458
- Check.
- Ready to go, sir.

01:28:11.459 --> 01:28:13.583
Relax, Quaid.

01:28:13.751 --> 01:28:17.083
- You'll like being Hauser.
- The guy's a fucking asshole.

01:28:17.251 --> 01:28:20.375
Not true.
He's one of my best friends.

01:28:20.542 --> 01:28:23.375
Besides, he's got
a big house and a Mercedes.

01:28:23.542 --> 01:28:27.500
And you like Melina, right?
You'll get to fuck her every night.

01:28:27.667 --> 01:28:30.541
That's right.
She's going to be Hauser's babe.

01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:32.875
I'll bust his balls.

01:28:35.167 --> 01:28:37.375
Uh-uh, princess.

01:28:37.542 --> 01:28:39.875
We're having you fixed.

01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:43.208
You're going to be
respectful, compliant

01:28:43.376 --> 01:28:46.791
and appreciative,
the way a woman should be.

01:28:50.667 --> 01:28:52.750
Mr Cohaagen, telephone.

01:28:55.459 --> 01:28:57.083
Yes? What is it?

01:28:57.251 --> 01:28:59.875
<i>The oxygen level
is bottoming out in Sector G.</i>

01:29:00.042 --> 01:29:02.208
<i>What do you want me
to do about it?</i>

01:29:02.376 --> 01:29:06.375
- Don't do anything.
- <i>But they won't last an hour, sir.</i>

01:29:06.542 --> 01:29:08.916
Fuck 'em. it'll be a good lesson
to the others.

01:29:09.084 --> 01:29:12.875
Come on, you got what you want.
Give these people air.

01:29:13.042 --> 01:29:16.791
My friend, in five minutes
you won't give a shit about the people.

01:29:16.959 --> 01:29:18.083
Fire it up, Doc.

01:29:18.251 --> 01:29:20.291
Excuse me, Doctor.

01:29:20.459 --> 01:29:22.500
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.

01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:24.750
Oh, really?

01:29:35.251 --> 01:29:38.583
Quaid, I'm having a party tonight.
Why don't you and Melina drop by?

01:29:38.751 --> 01:29:40.250
- Remind him, Doc.
- Sure.

01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:42.000
See you at the party.

01:29:56.667 --> 01:29:59.166
Keep still.
Fighting just makes it hurt.

01:30:11.959 --> 01:30:14.750
If you don't keep still,
you'll end up psychotic.

01:30:18.959 --> 01:30:20.458
Hey, don't!

01:30:27.376 --> 01:30:29.041
Melina, hold on!

01:30:51.959 --> 01:30:55.208
Are you all right?
Are you still you?

01:30:55.376 --> 01:30:58.750
I'm not sure, dear.
What do you think?

01:31:01.667 --> 01:31:04.041
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:31:30.292 --> 01:31:32.625
You have to make a decision, sir.

01:31:43.126 --> 01:31:44.416
Kill him.

01:31:45.626 --> 01:31:47.625
It's about goddamn time.

01:32:39.917 --> 01:32:42.541
- Where are you going?
- To the reactor.

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:46.333
- What reactor?
- The one in the mines. Come on!

01:32:46.501 --> 01:32:50.458
People are dying, Quaid!
Stop! We've got to get air!

01:32:50.626 --> 01:32:53.750
The reactor makes air.
That's Cohaagen's secret. Let's go.

01:32:53.917 --> 01:32:55.333
Where's this reactor come from?

01:32:55.501 --> 01:32:57.458
- Aliens built it.
- Aliens?

01:32:57.626 --> 01:33:01.000
- Are you sure about this?
- It's just up ahead.

01:33:03.626 --> 01:33:05.833
What the hell?

01:33:29.292 --> 01:33:33.333
Quaid! Hey, Quaid,
you remember me?

01:33:33.501 --> 01:33:35.750
Benny! Benny's the name!

01:33:50.001 --> 01:33:51.500
Oh, that's good!

01:33:57.292 --> 01:34:01.458
I'm gonna drill you, sucker!
I'm gonna grind you up!

01:34:07.167 --> 01:34:10.416
Ha-ha! I'm coming!

01:34:10.584 --> 01:34:12.416
I'm coming for you, baby!

01:34:27.917 --> 01:34:29.958
What the fuck is this?

01:34:36.501 --> 01:34:38.583
Damn this piece of Martian junk!

01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:43.416
Hey, Quaid,
I'm gonna squash you!

01:34:44.709 --> 01:34:46.583
Benny, here!

01:34:49.792 --> 01:34:51.416
Where the fuck are you?

01:34:57.084 --> 01:34:58.791
Screw you!

01:35:04.917 --> 01:35:08.791
- Quaid, get over here!
- What is it?

01:35:09.792 --> 01:35:13.583
- There's an opening.
- I knew it.

01:35:42.417 --> 01:35:45.625
This whole thing is one big reactor
made out of terbinium.

01:35:45.792 --> 01:35:49.041
Cohaagen knows it makes air.
The bastard won't turn it on.

01:35:49.209 --> 01:35:53.500
Of course not. If Mars had
an atmosphere, he'd lose control.

01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:56.083
See down there?

01:35:57.209 --> 01:35:59.541
It's a glacier.

01:35:59.709 --> 01:36:02.750
The whole core of Mars is ice.

01:36:02.917 --> 01:36:07.125
The reactor melts it
and it releases the oxygen.

01:36:07.292 --> 01:36:08.541
Come on.

01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:11.625
- Enough for everyone to breathe?
- Sure.

01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:14.625
Enough for the whole planet.

01:36:14.792 --> 01:36:17.083
If we turn it on in time.

01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:25.708
Come on. Come on!

01:36:42.626 --> 01:36:43.875
Hold on.

01:37:15.209 --> 01:37:16.083
Now!

01:37:46.459 --> 01:37:47.708
Son of a bitch.

01:37:55.584 --> 01:37:57.166
Move!

01:38:00.001 --> 01:38:02.000
He's got a hologram!

01:38:24.001 --> 01:38:26.708
You think this is
the real Quaid? It is.

01:39:46.126 --> 01:39:48.375
You're coming with me!

01:40:02.084 --> 01:40:04.291
See you at the party, Richter.

01:40:42.584 --> 01:40:47.000
- Don't touch that! Get back!
- What are you afraid of?

01:40:47.167 --> 01:40:49.458
- Turn it on.
- Impossible!

01:40:49.626 --> 01:40:52.750
Once the reaction starts, it'll spread
to all the terbinium in the planet.

01:40:52.917 --> 01:40:55.166
Mars will go into global meltdown.

01:40:55.334 --> 01:40:57.833
That's why the aliens
never turned it on.

01:40:58.001 --> 01:40:59.958
And you expect me to believe you?

01:41:00.126 --> 01:41:04.750
Who gives a shit what you believe?
In 30 seconds you'll be dead.

01:41:04.917 --> 01:41:08.125
Then I'll blow this place up
and be home in time for cornflakes.

01:41:11.834 --> 01:41:15.791
I didn't want it to end this way.
I wanted Hauser back. But no.

01:41:17.126 --> 01:41:19.125
You had to be Quaid!

01:41:19.292 --> 01:41:21.625
- I am Quaid.
- You're nothing!

01:41:21.792 --> 01:41:24.875
You're nobody!
You're a stupid dream.

01:41:25.042 --> 01:41:29.000
Well, all dreams come to an end.

01:42:43.792 --> 01:42:46.041
Melina, hold on!

01:42:46.209 --> 01:42:49.750
Don't do it! We'll all die!

01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:53.208
Everybody will die!

01:43:56.292 --> 01:43:57.625
Quaid!

01:49:12.459 --> 01:49:14.833
I can't believe it.
It's like a dream.

01:49:16.167 --> 01:49:17.666
What's wrong?

01:49:17.834 --> 01:49:21.666
I just had a terrible thought.
What if this is a dream?

01:49:23.167 --> 01:49:26.250
Well, then kiss me quick
before you wake up.
