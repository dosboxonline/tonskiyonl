200 miles.

10:19.536 --> 10:22.622

bucks, and throw in some film.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.040

10:24.124 --> 10:25.250

10:48.773 --> 10:51.234

she likes animals

10:51.317 --> 10:54.529
and-and photography, so I...

10:54.612 --> 10:58.658
I did a google search,
and I found the address.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.702
But I don't know that it's her.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.997

11:04.080 --> 11:06.249

wuss out.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.381
We're 20 minutes away,
so just get in the car.

11:13.465 --> 11:16.801
You two idiots, you gotta...

11:16.885 --> 11:18.178
you gotta walk with me
to the door.

11:18.261 --> 11:20.889
Okay? 'Cause I don't think
I can do this alone.

11:24.059 --> 11:27.354
Great. Great.
Let's go. Hurry!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.939
-We're the idiots.
-Yeah.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.781
Sags in the middle,
but it was cheap.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.449
Besides, I don't sleep much.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.786
Yeah, I could tell.
A lot of coffee cups.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.079
Must get expensive.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.664
What can I say?
I love my dark roast.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.251
(both chuckle)

11:50.335 --> 11:52.837
I never really liked
the taste of coffee.

11:52.921 --> 11:57.384
Oh, it's just about the beans.
I'll take you to my spot.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.638
You look exhausted.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.558
No, I'm-I'm fine.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.353
Tell me what's up?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.527
This place is no joke, Dej.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.200
I mean, I knew it wouldn't be,
it's Harvard, but...

12:22.283 --> 12:23.702
it's on a whole 'nother level.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.081
You know, if there's not
a test one day,

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
there's a paper due
the next Monday.

12:30.250 --> 12:34.295
And I got Janelle half the time.
Jennifer doesn't make it easy.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.631
And if I'm not studying,
I'm working.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.384
'Cause scholarships, they cover
tuition, but not books

12:39.467 --> 12:42.387
and food and clothes and...

12:42.470 --> 12:44.055
How much time do you need
to finish your paper?

12:44.139 --> 12:47.809
No. No way. No, you're
only here for a day.

12:47.892 --> 12:51.479
Look, Malik, how much time?

12:51.563 --> 12:55.442
Like, an hour.

12:55.525 --> 12:59.279
Take two.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.698
-Are you serious?
-I'm serious.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.325
-You sure?
-Very sure.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.411
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank...

13:06.494 --> 13:09.205
Mwah, mwah, mwah.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.623
I'm gonna make it up
to you tonight.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.543
After my paper, we goin' out.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.007
(door shuts)

13:21.343 --> 13:22.802
NICKY:
Okay...

13:22.886 --> 13:26.014
Hello, Sally. Hi, Sally.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.433
-(doorbell rings)
-It's been... 50...

13:28.516 --> 13:31.144
-It's been 50 years.
-REBECCA: I hear someone.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.271
Someone's home.

13:33.355 --> 13:34.606
-MIGUEL: Really?
-REBECCA: Uh-huh.

13:34.689 --> 13:35.857
I don't think so.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.025
-(Rebecca gasps)
-Oh, okay.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.276
MIGUEL:
Here we go.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.865
It's her. It's her.
It's her.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.745
Hello?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.038
Say "Hi, Sally."

13:54.793 --> 13:56.252
I finally made it
to California,

13:56.336 --> 13:59.339
and boy are my arms tired.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.758
I'm sorry, do I know you?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.718
Okay...

14:03.802 --> 14:05.387
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Hi, Sally.

14:05.470 --> 14:08.014
This is, uh, Nicky Pearson.

14:08.098 --> 14:11.434
In 1969, his path
crossed with yours

14:11.518 --> 14:15.355
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
on your way to Woodstock.

14:15.438 --> 14:17.524
And he's been pining
for you ever since.

14:17.607 --> 14:22.278
Oh, and he, um,
he got you this gift here.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.114
It's an old camera,
'cause I remember

14:24.197 --> 14:26.533
you used to take pictures.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.462
Oh, my God.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.966
(chuckles)

14:45.218 --> 14:47.095
Hello, Nicky.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.558
Hello, Sally.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.358
♪ ♪

15:21.379 --> 15:22.922
-Nice.
-Mm-hmm.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.427
You've got an eye.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.805
Oh, no, that was taken
by a friend of mine

15:30.889 --> 15:32.307
in Cambria.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.976
A pro.

15:35.060 --> 15:38.021
No, I, uh, got a job at
a pharmaceutical company

15:38.104 --> 15:40.565
in the late '70s.
Help yourself.

15:40.648 --> 15:44.611
And, uh, well, photography
became more of a hobby.

15:48.907 --> 15:51.910
How was Woodstock?

15:51.993 --> 15:54.537
(chuckles)
Wet.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.749
It rained a lot.

15:57.832 --> 15:59.626
My friends told me
I'm in Scorsese's

15:59.709 --> 16:01.795
Woodstock documentary.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.798
They say I'm dancing topless.

16:04.881 --> 16:08.468
But I can't bring myself
to watch it.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.845
Oh, I could certainly
bring myself to watch that.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.389
Yeah.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.810
(laughs)

16:21.064 --> 16:22.732
Oh...

16:24.109 --> 16:26.319
Oh, what do we have here?

16:26.403 --> 16:28.238
Oh, hi, hi. Um...

16:28.321 --> 16:30.031
Well, these are old friends
of mine

16:30.115 --> 16:31.866
from when I lived
in Pittsburgh.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.827
This is my husband Eric.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.830
Nicky and Miguel and...

16:36.913 --> 16:38.415
Rebecca. Hi.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.292
-ERIC: Hey. Nice to meet you.
-REBECCA: Very nice to meet you.

16:41.376 --> 16:44.170
MIGUEL:
You have a very lovely...

16:44.254 --> 16:46.297
Yeah, well, uh,
we should be going.

16:46.381 --> 16:48.258
So, thanks for letting us
use the can there.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.011
Well, stay for dinner.

16:51.094 --> 16:52.429
REBECCA:
No, no, no, no.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.973
We wouldn't want to impose.

16:55.056 --> 16:58.351
Oh, come on.
We have plenty of food.

16:58.435 --> 17:01.187
Yeah, yeah, please.

17:01.271 --> 17:04.524
Uh, yeah, please stay.
Uh... insist.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.696
-Sure.
-Sure. Thank you.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.365
-We'll... We'll stay.
-SALLY: That's lovely.
(chuckles)

17:16.036 --> 17:17.871
Hey, Dej.

17:23.752 --> 17:27.380
Wow, you, uh... Um...

17:27.464 --> 17:28.923
You, uh...

17:30.717 --> 17:33.345
Y-You look...

17:33.428 --> 17:34.929
incandescent.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.724
(laughs)

17:37.807 --> 17:39.142
Okay, Harvard.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.269
(both laugh)

17:41.353 --> 17:44.647
Sure this isn't too much?

17:44.731 --> 17:48.026
Babe, you sat on a bus

17:48.109 --> 17:50.278
that I know smelled rank

17:50.362 --> 17:52.781
-for five hours.
-Mm-hmm.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.825
And you had to deal with
my messy Jennifer situation,

17:55.909 --> 17:57.494
and you still gave me
the two hours

17:57.577 --> 18:01.122
I desperately needed to finish
my Russian Lit paper.

18:01.206 --> 18:05.126
You're not too much.

18:05.210 --> 18:09.089
This dress is not too much.
I love it.

18:12.092 --> 18:15.053
I love you.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.264
I don't know whether to keep you
here or show you off.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.687
-Show me off.
-(both giggle)

18:23.770 --> 18:27.857
I seem to remember you
having a brother, Nicky.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.235
Yeah, Jack. He's dead.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.946
He was my husband.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.323
And he was Miguel's best friend,

18:35.407 --> 18:37.158
but he didn't,
he didn't snake his widow.

18:38.868 --> 18:41.830
I see. I think.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.332
Nicky, help me.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.794
It's so long ago.
Where did we meet?

18:49.754 --> 18:51.172
At the vet's.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.300
Ah, okay.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.636
We worked together one summer

18:56.720 --> 19:00.140
at the veterinarian clinic
in Pittsburgh.

19:00.223 --> 19:03.435
Yes. In June of 1969.

19:03.518 --> 19:06.646
And you were wearing a long,

19:06.730 --> 19:08.565
red floral dress.

19:10.567 --> 19:14.529
And I sort of asked you out
on a date,

19:14.612 --> 19:18.616
which we spent in the back
of your Volkswagen van

19:18.700 --> 19:22.537
you named Pearl.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.832
And you, uh...

19:25.915 --> 19:30.045
You deflowered me under a moon

19:30.128 --> 19:32.714
that men had just walked upon.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.053
Oh, my God.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.305
Yes.

19:40.388 --> 19:44.184
Yes, it's all coming back
to me now.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.020
The moon. Your parents.

19:47.103 --> 19:50.357
-Salisbury steak. (laughs)
-(laughs)

19:50.440 --> 19:51.608
Oh, gosh.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.526
For a minute there
I thought I had

19:53.610 --> 19:55.904
early onset Alzheimer's.

19:55.987 --> 19:59.240
Or not just early.
Plain old Alzheimer's.

19:59.324 --> 20:01.576
-(laughs)
-ERIC: Deflowered, huh?

20:01.659 --> 20:06.247
Seems my wife defoliated
much of the northeast.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.999
You reaped the rewards.

20:08.083 --> 20:09.417
ERIC:
Oh, she could teach
a master class.

20:09.501 --> 20:11.086
SALLY:
Ah. Cheers.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.921
MIGUEL:
This meal is excellent.

20:13.004 --> 20:16.883
You know, Rebecca has
a cold asparagus soup recipe.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.469
JACK:
Perfect end to a perfect day.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.555
(chuckles)

20:22.639 --> 20:25.892
I'm gonna get one
of these sometime. Someday.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.103
I mean, after we buy

20:28.186 --> 20:30.814
a sensible family car,
of course.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.233
You know, maybe like
a midlife crisis purchase.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.027
-Just warning you.
-(laughs)

20:39.030 --> 20:41.741
I always thought the wind in my
hair would be overrated,

20:41.825 --> 20:44.411
but it is properly rated.

20:45.412 --> 20:49.916
A car like this can make
a person feel immortal.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.628
I don't need a car
to feel that.

20:53.712 --> 20:55.380
I got you.

21:00.010 --> 21:02.095
I'm not even a cold soup guy,

21:02.178 --> 21:04.889
but hers is just some...

21:04.973 --> 21:07.350
I do have Alzheimer's.

21:09.728 --> 21:13.231
Yeah, I have, um, plaques

21:13.314 --> 21:15.525
forming on my brain,

21:15.608 --> 21:20.321
and no amount of medications
or word exercises

21:20.405 --> 21:21.656
will cure me.

21:21.740 --> 21:23.700
First goes
the short-term memory,

21:23.783 --> 21:25.994
and then the longer ones,
one by one.

21:26.077 --> 21:29.748
Or is it a thousand each day?

21:29.831 --> 21:32.375
I don't even know.

21:32.459 --> 21:37.881
Sometimes I think about what
my very last memory will be

21:37.964 --> 21:41.092
before the candle goes out.

21:45.555 --> 21:48.183
I am so embarrassed.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.518
Rebecca, I'm sorry.
I-I had no idea.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.104
No, no, no, you wouldn't know.

21:53.188 --> 21:57.609
You would think
that this diagnosis

21:57.692 --> 21:59.235
would help me sweat
the small stuff less,

21:59.319 --> 22:01.863
but not really.

22:01.946 --> 22:04.074
I just, this morning,

22:04.157 --> 22:07.160
rolling out the garbage cans
before we left was something

22:07.243 --> 22:09.329
that kept nagging at me.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.664
Even during this dinner,
this strange dinner,

22:11.748 --> 22:13.792
I thought about them.

22:13.875 --> 22:18.129
You'd think that we would
stop sweating the small stuff

22:18.213 --> 22:21.675
as we got older,
when bigger things

22:21.758 --> 22:25.929
started happening to us,
but nope.

22:26.012 --> 22:29.683
Not the case.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.560
It's so strange, isn't it?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.900
ERIC:
The deck.

22:38.983 --> 22:44.364
I-I worry about the deck
we-we built out back.

22:44.447 --> 22:47.200
Um...

22:47.283 --> 22:48.326
it was built without permits,

22:48.410 --> 22:49.911
and I'm afraid it's gonna
collapse,

22:49.994 --> 22:51.996
or the city's gonna find out
and, you know, come after me.

22:52.080 --> 22:54.958
It's stupid, I know,
but I wonder

22:55.041 --> 22:58.962
how many, uh, months I've spent

22:59.045 --> 23:01.798
thinking about that day.

23:01.881 --> 23:05.969
I still look at my hairbrush
in the morning,

23:06.052 --> 23:07.595
looking for fallout.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.017
It's kind of my signature thing,
my hair.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.977
You have great hair.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.187
-MIGUEL: You, too, Nicky.
-Thank you.
-(Sally chuckles)

23:16.271 --> 23:19.566
I've only lost, like,
seven strands in 30 years.

23:19.649 --> 23:24.029
But still, I worry that
I'm gonna lose all my hair.

23:24.112 --> 23:27.782
The years that I have lost

23:27.866 --> 23:29.701
worrying about something
that never happened.

23:29.784 --> 23:33.288
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

23:33.371 --> 23:37.167
NICKY (sighs):
Oh, God,

23:37.250 --> 23:39.794
I wonder how many years

23:39.878 --> 23:43.048
I spent thinking about Sally.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.133
I mean...

23:45.216 --> 23:49.429
oh, like, decades maybe?
I don't know.

23:49.512 --> 23:54.225
But, uh, you know, uh,
I d-- I don't regret that.

23:54.309 --> 23:56.770
That, um...

23:56.853 --> 24:00.482
those lost years.

24:00.565 --> 24:04.027
I think... I think
it got me through.

24:04.110 --> 24:08.615
It gave me, uh, reason to hope

24:08.698 --> 24:11.659
that, you know, one day
something good might happen

24:11.743 --> 24:12.827
to me.

24:16.873 --> 24:20.794
Maybe it was all leading up
to this, the...

24:20.877 --> 24:23.838
most awkward meal of all time.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.511
But not a waste of time.

24:29.594 --> 24:31.846
No way.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.932
Not for me.

24:37.143 --> 24:39.187
That's lovely, Nicky.

24:41.815 --> 24:44.901
ERIC:
You know, the only true love
is unrequited love.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.737
So maybe it's better to love

24:47.821 --> 24:50.115
an idealized version
of your partner.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.908
(laughs)
I don't know.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.536
I hope everyone saved room
for dessert.

24:54.619 --> 24:58.331
I regret buying
our satellite dish.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.211
When we got it,

25:03.294 --> 25:06.548
our den became Eric's retreat.

25:09.426 --> 25:13.722
Now we watch TV separately,

25:13.805 --> 25:17.225
we eat our meals separately.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.894
I cook chickens
for the week because

25:19.978 --> 25:24.190
I don't know when he is
going to want his dinner.

25:24.274 --> 25:28.069
Sal, that wasn't keeping

25:28.153 --> 25:30.321
in the spirit of the topic.

25:30.405 --> 25:33.116
We were talking about
not sweating the small stuff,

25:33.199 --> 25:37.954
not airing your bigger issues
with me in front of strangers.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.248
They're not strangers, Eric.

25:42.876 --> 25:45.795
Nicky is an old friend...

25:48.006 --> 25:53.011
...who has pined after me
for 50 years

25:53.094 --> 25:56.139
while you have treated me

25:56.222 --> 25:57.849
like a line cook.

26:00.352 --> 26:03.688
I've known him longer
than I have known you.

26:03.772 --> 26:06.399
The only reason I don't

26:06.483 --> 26:09.486
bring up the small things

26:09.569 --> 26:12.822
is because the big things
leave me no room

26:12.906 --> 26:14.699
to worry about anything else.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.178
Bourbon, gentlemen?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.013
Yes, please.

26:37.097 --> 26:39.683
I'm an alcoholic.

26:39.766 --> 26:42.894
Yeah, he is.

27:05.417 --> 27:09.295
We were inseparable
when we were young.

27:10.630 --> 27:14.843
First two years we were married,
sex every day.

27:14.926 --> 27:17.095
Twice on Saturday.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.598
-My.
-(laughs)

27:22.392 --> 27:25.145
He couldn't get enough of me.

27:25.228 --> 27:29.482
-I was something else back then.
-I can see that.

27:29.566 --> 27:31.276
I bet you turned heads, too.

27:31.359 --> 27:33.945
Well...

27:34.029 --> 27:36.781
I had my days.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.284
(chuckles)

27:39.367 --> 27:42.495
My first husband got
the showroom model of me.

27:43.538 --> 27:46.166
Miguel... got the...

27:46.249 --> 27:50.045
used classic
with a ton of miles.

27:50.128 --> 27:53.673
Well, he seems to worship you.

27:53.757 --> 27:56.926
I struck gold twice.

28:04.976 --> 28:10.231
I stopped taking pictures
of myself.

28:10.315 --> 28:11.858
That was my thing:

28:11.941 --> 28:14.277
completely open self-portraits.

28:14.361 --> 28:18.365
-Hmm.
-Then it stopped.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.835
When is it that it changes,
Rebecca?

28:33.421 --> 28:35.882
When is it that we stop wanting

28:35.965 --> 28:38.551
to see reflections of ourselves?

28:38.635 --> 28:42.305
Mm.

28:42.389 --> 28:43.807
(clears throat)

28:43.890 --> 28:47.352
Miguel is from Puerto Rico,
and...

28:47.435 --> 28:51.856
(grunts) for, uh, our wedding
we took salsa lessons

28:51.940 --> 28:55.235
so we could salsa dance
at our reception.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.612
And then, even after
we were married, you know,

28:57.696 --> 29:01.741
we, um, we'd find a club
or some rec center

29:01.825 --> 29:03.368
that had salsa nights;
I loved it.

29:05.453 --> 29:08.790
And then this one time
we were dancing--

29:08.873 --> 29:12.627
and we were older,
you know, in our 60s--

29:12.711 --> 29:17.048
and there was this young girl
in a pink dress--

29:17.132 --> 29:18.800
I'll never forget her face--

29:18.883 --> 29:22.012
pointing at me
like I was some novelty act.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.681
Like it was so brave of me
to be dancing at my age.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.766
(Sally scoffs)

29:26.850 --> 29:29.811
-I never salsa danced
ever again, that was it.
-Aw.

29:29.894 --> 29:32.897
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

29:32.981 --> 29:36.234
I blamed it on my sciatica.

29:36.317 --> 29:39.571
Now I cover my liver spots
on my hands with makeup,

29:39.654 --> 29:43.199
and I will not leave the house
without a scarf to hide my neck.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.453
(sighs heavily)

29:46.536 --> 29:50.749
-My friend Bernadette,
she's our age.
-Mm-hmm.

29:50.832 --> 29:54.252
She quit coloring her hair
and went totally gray.

29:54.336 --> 29:56.713
She said it was so liberating,

29:56.796 --> 30:01.259
like throwing away the crutches
and being able to walk again.

30:01.343 --> 30:03.136
(laughing):
Sure.

30:03.219 --> 30:05.305
Bernadette is full of crap.
