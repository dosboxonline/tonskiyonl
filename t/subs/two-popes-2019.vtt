01:18.083 --> 01:22.291
Once, a young man was walking
in the woods.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.083
His name was Francesco Bernadone.

01:30.041 --> 01:32.500
Suddenly, he found a chapel...

01:32.708 --> 01:34.333
ruined,

01:34.541 --> 01:37.791
with the walls destroyed.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.083
He stepped inside.

01:39.791 --> 01:41.916
A crucifix was still there,

01:42.541 --> 01:45.041
where the altar had been.

01:46.583 --> 01:51.500
Francesco felt captivated.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.458
The crucifix spoke to him and said,

01:54.750 --> 01:57.791
“Francesco, repair my Church.”

02:00.166 --> 02:02.375
Francesco was a practical man.

02:02.458 --> 02:05.125
He went up to the quarry on Mount Subasio,

02:05.458 --> 02:06.958
cut stones,

02:07.916 --> 02:09.750
carted them down the mountain,

02:10.291 --> 02:13.333
and repaired the broken walls.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.125
Any journey,

02:17.875 --> 02:19.458
no matter how long,

02:20.500 --> 02:22.875
has to start somewhere.

02:23.958 --> 02:27.208
Any journey, no matter how glorious,

02:27.708 --> 02:29.416
can start with a mistake.

02:29.666 --> 02:33.125
So, when you feel lost,

02:33.208 --> 02:34.500
don’t worry.

02:35.416 --> 02:38.125
God will not give up.

02:38.708 --> 02:39.625
Understood?

02:40.875 --> 02:42.291
Understood?

02:45.000 --> 02:46.458
I’ve been thinking...

02:46.541 --> 02:49.250
We have many troubles here.

02:51.083 --> 02:56.375
It’s not fair to leave it all to Our Lady.

02:56.875 --> 03:01.541
Who else could pray for us?

03:05.875 --> 03:07.666
Let's see... Young man!

03:07.916 --> 03:09.000
What’s your name?

03:10.541 --> 03:13.000
The name of my team, San Lorenzo!

03:22.833 --> 03:25.958
San Lorenzo, pray for us...

03:47.666 --> 03:48.583
Father.

03:48.750 --> 03:49.833
The Pope...

03:51.208 --> 03:52.500
The Pope has died.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.500
Brothers and sisters,

04:08.750 --> 04:13.166
our beloved Holy Father John Paul II

04:13.500 --> 04:16.083
has returned to the Lord's house.

04:39.583 --> 04:40.666
This?

04:40.958 --> 04:44.000
Archbishop of Kiev, Cardinal Husar.

04:44.083 --> 04:44.916
Good.

04:45.166 --> 04:46.041
This?

04:46.333 --> 04:48.208
Cardinal Arinze of Nigeria.

04:48.375 --> 04:50.708
Many say he will be
the first African Pope.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.500
Good. This?

04:54.625 --> 04:56.250
Bergoglio, Argentina.

04:56.750 --> 05:00.000
Leading advocate for reform.
Very popular in--

05:00.083 --> 05:01.291
I know who he is.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.208
This?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.250
Cardinal Martini.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.666
They will choose
between tradition and reform.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.458
[in Latin] What's the hymn
you are whistling?

05:51.791 --> 05:53.041
[in Latin] "Dancing Queen."

05:55.916 --> 05:57.041
[in Latin] By ABBA.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.000
Good afternoon.

06:18.250 --> 06:21.750
The Church is too used to this glory.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.125
This is Europe...

06:24.208 --> 06:26.666
Our churches are beautiful but empty,

06:28.291 --> 06:30.125
like a fire covered in ash.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.125
We need someone to blow the ash away.

06:33.750 --> 06:34.583
You.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.708
Someone outside of Europe is better.

06:37.791 --> 06:39.666
No, Martini. Not me.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.500
Thank you for the beautiful sermon.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.708
You are welcome.

06:50.291 --> 06:53.125
Cardinal Hummes, life was easier

06:53.208 --> 06:54.833
when everybody spoke Latin.

06:54.916 --> 06:55.916
Nice to see you.

07:01.833 --> 07:05.833
No "nice to see you" for you, Jorge.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.958
The cardinals are about to vote.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.708
I call as my witness Christ the Lord,

08:56.375 --> 08:59.166
who will judge me,
that I elect the one who I deem...

09:00.708 --> 09:04.208
should be chosen according to God.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.625
The results of the first scrutiny...

10:44.500 --> 10:48.166
Joseph Ratzinger, 47 votes.

10:49.458 --> 10:52.625
Jorge Bergoglio, ten votes.

10:54.666 --> 10:56.583
Carlo Maria Martini...

10:58.041 --> 10:59.458
Nine votes.

11:08.125 --> 11:12.416
...no cardinal obtained
the 77 votes needed.

12:35.916 --> 12:37.333
The results...

12:38.041 --> 12:40.416
of the third scrutiny...

12:41.833 --> 12:43.000
are the following:

12:47.416 --> 12:50.000
It's white!

14:23.958 --> 14:26.000
Jorge, what will you do now?

14:27.541 --> 14:29.083
Return to Buenos Aires,

14:29.541 --> 14:30.750
plan my retirement.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.208
You're too young to retire.

14:34.708 --> 14:39.958
The Church voted to make
overdue reforms remain overdue.

14:40.833 --> 14:46.458
I can do more good
as a simple parish priest.

14:49.541 --> 14:50.916
Okay.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.791
I'll pray for him.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.708
This protects the "Doctrine of the Faith."

15:24.083 --> 15:26.375
He's already started with "no."

15:26.458 --> 15:28.791
"No against this, no against that..."

15:29.666 --> 15:34.041
It's bad for the poor in Brazil
and the poor in the world.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.458
People are abandoning Catholicism

15:36.541 --> 15:39.500
because it is too conservative.

16:02.916 --> 16:04.041
Bye, bye.

16:06.458 --> 16:08.708
Don't buy Tonio's stamps.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.541
They don't work.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.625
There’s nothing wrong with them.

16:13.708 --> 16:17.583
I wrote a beautiful letter, and no reply.

16:18.625 --> 16:22.250
Sent it again, still no reply.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.666
Your stamps don't work.

16:24.750 --> 16:27.541
Doesn't matter
how good your letter was, Jorge,

16:27.625 --> 16:30.041
San Lorenzo will never call you.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.791
Maybe you used the wrong address.

16:36.083 --> 16:37.500
Impossible.

16:37.791 --> 16:40.333
It’s a well-known address.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.750
To whom?

16:42.666 --> 16:43.708
The Pope.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.458
So,

16:46.750 --> 16:49.250
Tonio's stamps work.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.875
I have your letters,
and this is from the Vatican.

16:56.333 --> 16:58.041
Why the Pope?

16:58.125 --> 16:59.416
I booked my flight.

17:00.875 --> 17:01.750
Seriously?

17:02.583 --> 17:05.041
What's so urgent?

17:07.333 --> 17:08.791
You want to retire?

17:11.583 --> 17:12.791
Don't do it.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.916
We need you in Buenos Aires.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.750
He wants me in Rome.

17:19.833 --> 17:23.375
I booked my flight before this.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.125
A coincidence...

17:25.416 --> 17:27.541
There are no coincidences.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.916
We are all in God's hands.

18:47.583 --> 18:48.500
Good morning.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.208
-How are you?
-Good, thank you.

20:03.041 --> 20:07.666
Yes. It's a private matter,
so it's not in the official diary.

20:12.833 --> 20:15.291
He is reading the report.

20:15.541 --> 20:19.583
Yes, his Holiness is aware.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.083
I'll ask if he can speak to him.

20:23.041 --> 20:24.416
Your Holiness.

20:24.500 --> 20:26.750
Would you speak to Cardinal Bertone?

20:30.791 --> 20:31.875
I have him here.

21:16.916 --> 21:17.750
Where is he?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.666
Looks like he's lived here all his life.

21:27.083 --> 21:28.166
Oregano, exactly.

21:29.250 --> 21:32.291
My mother swore by oregano.

21:34.291 --> 21:36.750
It makes everything taste good.

21:36.833 --> 21:41.416
My mom mixes it with breadcrumbs.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.500
-Me too.
-Really?

21:43.666 --> 21:44.625
Yes!

21:46.208 --> 21:48.833
Everything the Pope eats comes
from Gandolfo.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.166
We send it to Rome. It's all organic.

21:51.250 --> 21:52.583
Vegetables, eggs, cheese.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.458
Good morning!

21:56.208 --> 21:57.166
[in Latin] Holiness.

22:02.583 --> 22:06.500
[in Latin] Last time we met,
we spoke Latin.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.541
[in Latin] A short meeting.

22:09.708 --> 22:13.291
[in Latin] I wasn't the student you were,
Holy Father.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.166
[in Latin] Please, not Latin.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.416
180 tickets sold.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.500
Great.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.125
-Am I free?
-Sure!

39:17.875 --> 39:19.208
What are you doing?

39:21.083 --> 39:23.916
Jorge, these results are the same.

39:24.416 --> 39:26.375
Yes, same experiment.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.583
What did we agree on?

39:30.083 --> 39:33.875
We have to test, test and test.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.333
We live and die by facts.

39:36.833 --> 39:37.916
Facts are...

39:39.000 --> 39:40.375
You've had a haircut.

39:41.750 --> 39:43.458
That is a fact.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.166
And that shirt is new.

39:48.416 --> 39:49.791
Also a fact.

39:51.250 --> 39:52.666
You've decided?

39:53.708 --> 39:56.166
You will propose!

39:56.958 --> 39:58.416
That's speculation.

39:58.500 --> 40:00.250
No, a deduction.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.375
An incorrect deduction.

40:04.250 --> 40:05.833
I already asked.

40:06.583 --> 40:08.666
Tonight we'll discuss the details.

40:09.333 --> 40:11.250
So, you won't be a priest.

40:11.875 --> 40:14.458
A logical conclusion, Esther.

40:15.458 --> 40:17.041
What took you so long?

40:19.333 --> 40:21.041
I had to listen to...

40:22.625 --> 40:23.458
you know,

40:23.541 --> 40:25.291
if He had other plans for me.

40:26.000 --> 40:26.875
He?

40:30.875 --> 40:34.333
This country doesn't need another priest.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.291
I'll redo the tests.

40:36.833 --> 40:39.583
-Next time, don't fool me.
-Promise.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.250
Jorge!

40:42.500 --> 40:44.416
You're going to be a great father.

40:50.666 --> 40:52.125
You're beautiful!

40:52.666 --> 40:54.083
The prettiest ones.

40:54.166 --> 40:55.875
How do I look?

40:55.958 --> 40:56.875
Very handsome!

41:47.291 --> 41:48.333
Come in.

42:01.625 --> 42:02.500
Come in.

42:05.333 --> 42:07.166
No, Father, I was just passing.

42:17.375 --> 42:19.833
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

42:20.875 --> 42:22.375
I'm listening, my son.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.208
Before we start, may I ask you something?

42:26.083 --> 42:28.541
I haven’t seen you around.
Where are you from?

42:28.750 --> 42:30.583
Parque Patricios.

42:31.125 --> 42:34.125
Sometimes I come here to give Mass.

42:34.250 --> 42:37.708
I'm praying
you’re not a Huracán supporter.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.750
Your prayers have been answered.

42:43.625 --> 42:47.208
I live close by
in the priests’ home for the sick.

42:48.208 --> 42:49.750
You tend to the sick.

42:50.125 --> 42:52.666
No. I'm one of them.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.125
I have cancer.

42:55.458 --> 42:56.333
Leukemia.

42:59.166 --> 43:00.958
Then why are you here, Father?

43:02.416 --> 43:04.333
I woke up this morning,

43:04.416 --> 43:06.916
the Lord asked me to hear confession.

43:07.375 --> 43:08.583
But no one came...

43:09.875 --> 43:11.541
until you.

43:15.166 --> 43:16.541
What is troubling you?

43:19.208 --> 43:20.666
I'm listening, son.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.416
Some time ago, I asked for a sign.

43:24.458 --> 43:25.625
Perhaps...

43:26.041 --> 43:27.875
He's giving it now.

43:30.458 --> 43:34.166
Maybe He wanted me here
to speak with you.

43:37.083 --> 43:38.458
With me?

43:42.791 --> 43:46.291
Now you know our Father is watching.

43:47.208 --> 43:48.958
You can confess.

43:50.333 --> 43:52.000
Free your heart.

44:50.333 --> 44:52.083
-Bergoglio.
-Yes.

44:52.625 --> 44:55.000
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

44:55.083 --> 44:57.166
-How are you?
-Good.

44:58.583 --> 45:01.083
Do you know what you're saying no to?

45:01.166 --> 45:02.666
-Yes.
-Yes?

45:02.916 --> 45:05.125
She even has a name.

45:05.375 --> 45:06.958
Oh, well.

45:07.041 --> 45:10.416
You will have to learn to love her
in another way.

45:11.291 --> 45:12.916
Love has many faces.

45:14.750 --> 45:18.166
It's a big mistake to think
one can live without love.

45:18.916 --> 45:20.500
I still have San Lorenzo.

53:46.375 --> 53:50.458
Cardinal, I have a souvenir for you.

53:52.250 --> 53:54.708
-I made some cuttings.
-Thank you!

53:56.125 --> 53:57.833
So, when you return home...

53:57.916 --> 53:59.000
Let me help you.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.916
Hey, Cardinal, need a lift?

56:56.083 --> 56:59.125
-How's the pizza?
-Better when hot.

57:55.125 --> 57:58.625
Thank you, Lord, for Pipita's gift.

57:59.333 --> 58:02.458
Also, Lord, bless our Pope.

58:02.750 --> 58:05.625
The German? Let him bless himself.

58:05.708 --> 58:06.625
Nazi.

58:26.666 --> 58:30.791
Let God grant him a quiet night
and a peaceful end.

58:59.541 --> 59:01.916
Holy Father, he's not there.

59:03.416 --> 59:04.875
What do you mean?

59:05.333 --> 59:08.333
We cannot find him.
I sent a car, but he's not there.

59:10.083 --> 59:10.958
Find him!

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:50.250
Silence incarnate!

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:04.916
People of Argentina:

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:11.833
The country faces a hard moment
in its history...

1:10:22.250 --> 1:10:23.666
I remarried.

1:10:23.750 --> 1:10:25.833
In other words, you live with someone.

1:10:41.041 --> 1:10:44.000
-What happened?
-We want our children. Where are they?

1:10:54.791 --> 1:10:59.125
We Argentinians say
there are thousands and thousands...

1:10:59.208 --> 1:11:04.291
of mothers and families suffering
in pain, anguish, and despair.

1:11:04.375 --> 1:11:07.041
We don't know where our children are!

1:11:07.125 --> 1:11:08.583
They say you lie.

1:11:08.666 --> 1:11:09.958
We are lying?

1:11:10.375 --> 1:11:13.291
That our children disappeared?

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:15.291
Where are they?

1:11:15.375 --> 1:11:16.208
Cowards!

1:11:16.666 --> 1:11:19.958
The so-called Christian Army have them!

1:11:26.291 --> 1:11:28.583
Neither oppressors nor oppressed.

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:05.458
Father.

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:14.250
Admiral.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:19.541
Father Bergoglio, from the seminary.

1:12:19.625 --> 1:12:21.833
-The seminary?
-Nice to meet you.

1:12:21.916 --> 1:12:25.708
Where Jesuits become Marxists
through books.

1:12:26.625 --> 1:12:28.958
He is with us and got rid of the books.

1:12:29.500 --> 1:12:33.583
Maybe a priest took them to a mission.

1:12:35.375 --> 1:12:37.291
It is a joke.

1:12:37.375 --> 1:12:38.750
My chaplain is a Jesuit.

1:12:39.208 --> 1:12:40.708
I'm listening, Bergoglio.

1:12:40.791 --> 1:12:44.000
Hélder Câmara, Church and Development.

1:12:44.083 --> 1:12:46.333
Yankee Imperialism in Latin America,
Olivares.

1:12:51.291 --> 1:12:53.666
I didn't understand the call.
What's happening?

1:12:53.750 --> 1:12:56.791
They are watching you, Esther.
We need to clear the house.

1:12:58.291 --> 1:12:59.416
Books...

1:13:00.375 --> 1:13:01.541
pamphlets...

1:13:01.625 --> 1:13:02.625
All of it.

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:05.583
Why the urgency?

1:13:05.666 --> 1:13:06.708
Gramsci.

1:13:06.791 --> 1:13:08.541
The Working Class. Peronism.

1:13:08.833 --> 1:13:10.208
Brecht. Marx.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:11.666
Psychoanalysis.

1:13:12.666 --> 1:13:15.041
How do you know they're watching?

1:13:16.875 --> 1:13:18.625
Who are you talking to?

1:13:22.625 --> 1:13:25.041
See this guy protesting with you?

1:13:25.333 --> 1:13:26.666
Gustavo.

1:13:26.875 --> 1:13:27.708
No.

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:30.375
His name is Astiz.

1:13:31.791 --> 1:13:34.458
Personal friend of Admiral Massera.

1:13:35.750 --> 1:13:38.333
Otherwise known
as the "Blond Angel of Death."

1:13:39.250 --> 1:13:40.666
An informer.

1:13:41.916 --> 1:13:44.333
He’s a son of a bitch.

1:13:55.833 --> 1:13:57.916
How long will you stay quiet?

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.541
Why don't you speak out?

1:14:02.416 --> 1:14:04.833
Why don’t you speak out?

1:14:05.208 --> 1:14:07.041
If I speak, I can't help.

1:14:07.125 --> 1:14:10.333
No. If you spoke,
you would be one more, like us.

1:14:10.458 --> 1:14:13.458
You like to be the one
in the admiral's palace...

1:14:13.541 --> 1:14:14.541
making contacts.

1:14:15.125 --> 1:14:16.166
Right?

1:14:55.208 --> 1:14:56.458
I was his teacher.

1:14:56.541 --> 1:14:59.083
Now he's head of the Jesuits in Argentina.

1:14:59.500 --> 1:15:01.125
And Uruguay.

1:15:01.208 --> 1:15:03.583
These are the guys learning skills.

1:15:03.666 --> 1:15:05.875
Come meet the boys I mentioned.

1:15:06.958 --> 1:15:08.500
They're real artists!

1:15:08.625 --> 1:15:09.916
Jalics!

1:15:11.125 --> 1:15:13.083
You need to close down Rivadavia.

1:15:16.666 --> 1:15:17.541
What?

1:15:17.625 --> 1:15:20.041
I need you to close this mission.

1:15:21.958 --> 1:15:22.833
Yorio!

1:15:23.916 --> 1:15:26.000
We didn't build this for nothing.

1:15:26.083 --> 1:15:27.541
We can't abandon people.

1:15:27.625 --> 1:15:31.583
With Massera,
if we haven't lost a Jesuit...

1:15:31.666 --> 1:15:34.041
It's because you didn’t speak out.

1:15:34.833 --> 1:15:37.458
And made us irrelevant.

1:15:41.291 --> 1:15:42.916
They’re watching...

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.125
and don’t like what they see.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:47.041
I know!

1:15:49.708 --> 1:15:51.875
-How?
-What?

1:15:52.958 --> 1:15:55.541
How do you know that, Jorge?

1:15:58.125 --> 1:16:00.125
Did you go to President Videla's house?

1:16:01.750 --> 1:16:03.250
To give communion?

1:16:07.041 --> 1:16:08.833
They are assassins, Jorge.

1:16:15.041 --> 1:16:17.333
My role is to protect the Order.

1:16:18.875 --> 1:16:21.708
That's our calling now?
To protect ourselves?

1:16:22.583 --> 1:16:24.625
I taught you...

1:16:25.333 --> 1:16:26.958
How do we know Christ?

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:30.041
By following in his footsteps.
Where do they lead?

1:16:30.125 --> 1:16:30.958
Here.

1:16:31.041 --> 1:16:33.250
Or before a firing squad!

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:35.416
If that's so, so be it!

1:16:37.041 --> 1:16:38.958
I'm your superior.

1:16:39.291 --> 1:16:42.875
I'm begging you to return to the seminary!

1:16:43.125 --> 1:16:44.666
If we don't obey?

1:16:45.583 --> 1:16:48.125
You are Jesuits. You made vows!

1:16:49.333 --> 1:16:51.750
Break them, and you're no longer Jesuits!

1:16:51.833 --> 1:16:55.000
If we aren’t Jesuits, we lose protection.

1:16:55.458 --> 1:16:57.375
It's like a death sentence.

1:16:57.458 --> 1:17:00.125
So keep your vows. Damn it!

1:17:01.083 --> 1:17:03.458
We refuse to cease our work.

1:17:04.416 --> 1:17:06.875
You keep drinking tea with killers.

1:17:08.083 --> 1:17:10.083
Listen to me!

1:17:10.166 --> 1:17:12.916
I'll talk to whoever helps me save lives.

1:17:13.833 --> 1:17:17.708
And you obey. Shut down the project!

1:17:18.875 --> 1:17:20.291
It is an order.

1:17:22.791 --> 1:17:25.250
You hear? It's an order!

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:55.000
I brought you some food...

1:18:10.791 --> 1:18:12.416
It's an order!

1:19:00.208 --> 1:19:01.750
Go home!

1:19:05.666 --> 1:19:08.666
The Mass is over. Who's the priest?

1:19:09.583 --> 1:19:10.708
Keep cool.

1:19:11.666 --> 1:19:13.750
Gentlemen, calm down, please.

1:20:16.416 --> 1:20:17.333
Admiral.

1:20:17.750 --> 1:20:18.583
The priest.

1:20:19.666 --> 1:20:20.791
Come in.

1:20:30.875 --> 1:20:32.166
Admiral.

1:20:32.250 --> 1:20:33.291
I'm listening.

1:20:34.333 --> 1:20:37.250
-You have my priests--
-Vilas' serve!

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:42.166
He is good, right?

1:20:43.458 --> 1:20:44.708
Admiral,

1:20:45.375 --> 1:20:48.875
you have my priests Jalics and Yorio...

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:50.458
detained.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:53.291
They are not political.

1:20:53.708 --> 1:20:55.125
Why did you kick them out?

1:20:55.208 --> 1:20:57.916
They were temporarily suspended.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:20:59.875
A technical matter.

1:21:00.208 --> 1:21:01.750
Who told you?

1:21:01.833 --> 1:21:03.708
We see and hear everything.

1:21:04.250 --> 1:21:05.958
Four months.

1:21:06.041 --> 1:21:07.416
What are you doing to them?

1:21:07.500 --> 1:21:08.791
Enough, Bergoglio!

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:11.666
I know full well where my priests are!

1:21:11.750 --> 1:21:13.458
They're not your priests.

1:21:13.958 --> 1:21:15.375
You just said so.

1:21:16.583 --> 1:21:18.083
It's a "technical matter."

1:21:21.208 --> 1:21:25.125
You should think before you act.

1:24:12.458 --> 1:24:16.666
God bless this food...

1:24:37.250 --> 1:24:39.291
NEW EVANGELISM
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE EXCLUDED

1:24:39.375 --> 1:24:42.125
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1:24:42.208 --> 1:24:46.125
I hate my former mother-in-law.

1:24:46.750 --> 1:24:48.833
I want to kill her.

1:24:48.916 --> 1:24:51.041
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1:24:53.958 --> 1:24:55.458
I have bad thoughts.

1:24:55.541 --> 1:24:56.958
I masturbate many times a day.

1:24:57.041 --> 1:24:58.708
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

1:24:58.791 --> 1:25:00.791
I live in sin constantly...

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:03.666
...I feel very ashamed about it...

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:05.708
I'm always depressed.

1:25:05.791 --> 1:25:08.000
...looking at them with sexual desire...

1:25:09.916 --> 1:25:11.458
I feel I'm a fraud...

1:25:44.875 --> 1:25:46.875
I had a TV.

1:25:50.333 --> 1:25:51.958
I liked to watch football.

1:25:53.291 --> 1:25:56.250
A TV needs an antenna and a signal.

1:25:57.958 --> 1:26:00.625
Sometimes the signal is bad.

1:26:01.333 --> 1:26:06.083
We don't know why,
but sometimes it doesn't work.

1:26:08.250 --> 1:26:10.541
It's the same when we pray.

1:26:12.125 --> 1:26:16.291
Sometimes the signal
God sends us is strong and clear.

1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:19.750
It works fine. One feels the connection,

1:26:19.833 --> 1:26:22.583
that we are really plugged in,

1:26:22.791 --> 1:26:24.541
in direct contact.

1:26:26.375 --> 1:26:28.458
But other days...

1:26:31.208 --> 1:26:33.916
one can only say,

1:26:34.708 --> 1:26:37.000
"Well, at least I tried."

1:26:38.458 --> 1:26:41.666
But you've gotten nothing back.

1:26:42.666 --> 1:26:45.000
You don't have an answer.

1:26:48.416 --> 1:26:52.750
You say,
"Father, that doesn't happen to you."

1:26:53.958 --> 1:26:57.125
People believe that, for us,
it's different...

1:26:57.208 --> 1:26:58.583
That we have...

1:26:59.583 --> 1:27:01.250
a direct line with God.

1:27:03.791 --> 1:27:05.250
No, it's not like that.

1:27:05.791 --> 1:27:08.916
For us, it's the same as for you,
and you...

1:27:20.791 --> 1:27:22.416
What I mean is...

1:27:27.541 --> 1:27:29.833
today, I'm not worthy
of delivering a sermon.

1:27:32.291 --> 1:27:36.333
My words would be empty.

1:27:41.083 --> 1:27:43.500
Today, you should teach me.

1:27:47.333 --> 1:27:49.083
That would be the best.

1:28:34.750 --> 1:28:39.000
You talk about tyranny!
Your friends were tyrants!

1:28:39.083 --> 1:28:41.583
They took away our companions!

1:28:41.666 --> 1:28:43.750
You are an accomplice.

1:28:43.833 --> 1:28:45.416
Friend of the military!

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.291
-Tell the truth!
-Where are they?

1:28:48.583 --> 1:28:51.041
-Where are they?
-Where are they?

1:30:29.708 --> 1:30:33.041
How difficult it is
to get out of ourselves sometimes,

1:30:33.791 --> 1:30:35.333
and stop being selfish.

1:30:36.166 --> 1:30:37.875
Because we think,

1:30:38.250 --> 1:30:42.625
"I'll be an idol, be loved, be the Lord."

1:30:42.708 --> 1:30:43.958
It's not like that.

1:30:44.041 --> 1:30:46.166
There's only one Lord. Up there.

1:30:47.416 --> 1:30:49.333
So, I want you to pass the ball.

1:30:49.416 --> 1:30:52.416
Román, you have Lucas here. Look at him!

1:30:53.750 --> 1:30:54.833
Is it clear?

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:57.291
-Understood?
-Yes.

1:30:57.375 --> 1:30:59.000
-Understood?
-Yes!

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:00.625
Let's play!

1:31:02.750 --> 1:31:05.583
With heart and short passes!

1:31:06.750 --> 1:31:08.541
Now you are playing as a team.

1:31:16.750 --> 1:31:18.125
Nice to meet you.

1:31:18.250 --> 1:31:20.458
It's a pleasure to listen to you.

1:32:55.333 --> 1:32:59.708
I absolve you in the name of the Father,
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

1:33:04.125 --> 1:33:05.291
Holy Father.

1:33:05.375 --> 1:33:07.916
It's nine o'clock.
They are opening the doors to the public.

1:33:10.291 --> 1:33:11.958
Would you like me to delay the opening?

1:34:06.416 --> 1:34:10.708
A margherita and diavola,
two Fantas, and a coffee.

1:35:29.125 --> 1:35:30.208
Good, right?

1:35:46.083 --> 1:35:48.875
Can you light the candles, please?

1:35:49.291 --> 1:35:51.000
They're lit, Father.

1:35:57.333 --> 1:36:00.125
Can you pass the stole? We're late.

1:36:03.041 --> 1:36:08.208
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

1:36:08.791 --> 1:36:09.625
Amen.

1:36:10.791 --> 1:36:12.291
Lord, wash me clean...

1:36:12.833 --> 1:36:14.041
from my sins,

1:36:16.125 --> 1:36:17.375
so I can celebrate...

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:22.666
these sacred mysteries.

1:36:26.958 --> 1:36:28.750
Now, let's give each other,

1:36:29.750 --> 1:36:31.041
everyone,

1:36:32.083 --> 1:36:34.875
a fraternal hug for peace.

1:48:09.166 --> 1:48:10.416
What is it?

1:48:11.458 --> 1:48:14.375
When he has something tricky to say,

1:48:14.666 --> 1:48:15.958
he speaks Latin.

1:48:27.416 --> 1:48:28.666
Did I hear right?

1:48:28.750 --> 1:48:30.041
Not sure.

1:48:33.375 --> 1:48:34.458
Did you get that?

1:48:35.833 --> 1:48:37.333
Are you sure?

1:48:49.666 --> 1:48:51.750
The Pope just renounced.

1:48:53.333 --> 1:48:54.416
What?

1:51:19.666 --> 1:51:21.708
Don't forget the poor.

1:51:40.291 --> 1:51:41.958
You have a phone?

1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.625
Holy Father, sorry, no reply.

1:52:11.750 --> 1:52:13.833
Holy Father, you must choose.

1:52:15.166 --> 1:52:17.250
I will wear what I am wearing.

1:52:23.125 --> 1:52:24.250
The shoes?

1:52:25.208 --> 1:52:27.708
They're part of a tradition from...

1:52:29.166 --> 1:52:31.041
No, mine are fine.

1:52:31.625 --> 1:52:33.291
Holy Father, the "mozzetta"?

1:52:34.125 --> 1:52:37.250
No, thank you. The carnival is over.

1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:58.500
If there has to be tears,

1:52:58.916 --> 1:53:01.500
let’s make them tears of joy.

1:54:17.916 --> 1:54:19.833
Brothers and sisters...

1:54:21.333 --> 1:54:22.625
good evening.

1:54:28.125 --> 1:54:29.958
You all know that...

1:54:30.375 --> 1:54:32.291
the duty of the conclave...

1:54:33.041 --> 1:54:36.208
was to give a bishop to Rome.

1:54:36.791 --> 1:54:40.041
It seems that my cardinal brothers...

1:54:41.500 --> 1:54:47.166
found one almost at the end of the world.

1:54:55.083 --> 1:54:57.500
Now, here we are.

1:55:01.666 --> 1:55:02.750
First of all,

1:55:04.416 --> 1:55:06.416
I'd like to say a prayer

1:55:07.458 --> 1:55:09.500
for our Bishop...

1:55:09.916 --> 1:55:12.958
Emeritus Benedict XVI.

1:55:23.500 --> 1:55:26.833
Let's pray together for him.

2:02:08.375 --> 2:02:10.416
Make sure to eat well!
