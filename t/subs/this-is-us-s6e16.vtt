help Alzheimer's patients to
feel, like, a sense of purpose.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.136
Brings them back to
a time where they,

09:55.220 --> 09:56.262
you know,
could take care of something.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.597
So she can pet it,
she can take care of it.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.265
Kill me. Kill me now.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.934
Not until you kill me first,
please.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.852
Guys.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.021
Come on. Who wants to go first?

10:05.105 --> 10:07.399
You know what,
senators before celebrities.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.275
-(chuckles)
-Come on. Take the kitty.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.236
(groans) "Take the kitty."
All right.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.738
-Oh, stop.
-RANDALL: Yeah. Okay.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.324
Okay.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.370
Oh, wow.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.330
This place really is
a time capsule, isn't it?

10:22.414 --> 10:24.082
Tell me about it.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.917
I found my Tommy Girl perfume
in the bathroom.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.919
(laughs)

10:28.003 --> 10:30.213
I think we should go
back to the house. Maybe...

10:30.296 --> 10:32.590
I don't know,
maybe we could be of some help.

10:32.674 --> 10:35.719
Oh, dear, sweet, naive Philip.

10:35.802 --> 10:38.388
We can't help those three.
Nobody can.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.140
-SOPHIE: Mm-hmm.
-(sets bottle down)

10:40.223 --> 10:45.437
Miguel's been gone
seven days now, and...

10:45.520 --> 10:48.732
that's seven days for
my husband's mind to spin out

10:48.815 --> 10:51.526
and try to figure out
what to do next with his mother.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.903
To gather his thoughts

10:53.987 --> 10:56.948
and then present his case
to his siblings.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.202
Well, Miguel was her family.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.038
And he was our man
on the ground.

11:04.372 --> 11:07.083
And we could justify
just dropping in for visits

11:07.167 --> 11:09.419
as our schedules allowed
as long as he was by her side,

11:09.502 --> 11:12.255
but... not anymore.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.303
I've been thinking about this
a lot for the last few days,

11:18.386 --> 11:20.388
and I think she should move in
with me.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.349
He's gonna want to
move her to Philly.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.933
(groans)

11:24.017 --> 11:25.101
That's gonna get Kevin
all riled up.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.144
(scoffs) You know it.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.521
SOPHIE:
Ah, and thus will begin

11:28.605 --> 11:32.067
the classic "Who is the better
man and son" pissing contest.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.321
(as Randall):
"She's our mother, Kev.

11:36.404 --> 11:40.075
"She has cared for us
our entire lives,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.077
"and now it's our turn
to care for her.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.995
Because she's our mother, Kev."

11:44.079 --> 11:45.914
(as Kevin):
"Oh, really? Really, Randall?

11:45.997 --> 11:47.624
"Well, thank you,
thank you for telling me

11:47.707 --> 11:48.792
"that our mother is our mother.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.502
"You know,
I built this house for her

11:50.585 --> 11:52.045
with my bare hands."

11:52.128 --> 11:54.506
-Mm-hmm.
-Wow. Wow, that's great.

11:54.589 --> 11:55.590
You two should take this
on the road.

11:55.674 --> 11:58.176
-Ah, thank you.
-We really should.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.261
Well, Kate's there.

12:00.345 --> 12:02.055
It's gonna be fine.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.060
What?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.439
-(knocking)
-Come in.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.069
You'll feel better
in the morning.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.078
I don't think I've seen you
wear that much makeup before.

12:26.496 --> 12:27.997
(sighs)

12:28.081 --> 12:29.624
Say what you want to say, Mom.

12:31.543 --> 12:34.671
You're young
and you're figuring it out.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.256
There's nothing wrong with that.

12:38.174 --> 12:42.429
But I do need you to know
that you have so much to offer.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.889
So when you go out
in the world...

12:46.307 --> 12:48.184
...I really hope you know that.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.938
Look.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.648
Two out of three isn't bad.

12:53.732 --> 12:56.109
Take the win.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.570
-What do you mean?
-Your kids.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.157
Two winners, one dud.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.408
Kind of like Hanson.

13:06.161 --> 13:08.413
The way you see me,

13:08.496 --> 13:10.415
the way...

13:10.498 --> 13:13.043
the way Dad saw me...

13:14.502 --> 13:15.837
You're wrong about me.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.593
KEVIN:
Randall, you're in D.C.,
what, like three days a week?

13:21.676 --> 13:22.927
Working till about 10:00.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.971
Beth's schedule is
just as insane as yours.

13:25.055 --> 13:26.765
How is moving to Philly
better for Mom?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.224
RANDALL:
It'll be better
'cause I'll be there.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.642
KEVIN:
Am I in <i>The Twilight Zone</i>
right now?

13:29.726 --> 13:30.894
What do you mean you'll be...?
You won't be there.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.438
I will be, man.
I will figure it out.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.940
Ka-Kate, you're Mom's guardian.
You have the final say.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.859
Do you have any thoughts
on Randall ripping Mom

13:37.942 --> 13:39.569
out of the house
and moving her to Philadelphia,

13:39.652 --> 13:41.196
just so she can sit alone
in the town house all day?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.823
W-- I don't know,

13:43.907 --> 13:45.617
but I think that we should
keep talking about it.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.660
She won't be alone, Kevin.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.245
I will find her
a full-time aide.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.748
She was very clear about
what she wanted, Randall.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.167
She looked me in the eye
and she said to me,

13:54.250 --> 13:56.920
"Build me that house,"
which is exactly what I've done.

13:57.003 --> 14:01.424
-Kev...
-Don't "Kev" me, Randall.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.054
I was a pain in her ass
her entire life.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.057
(muffled music playing
on earbuds)

14:11.059 --> 14:12.644
If you want to go get drunk
every night

14:12.727 --> 14:14.938
and make a fool out of yourself,
there's really not much

14:15.021 --> 14:17.273
I can do about it, but don't...

14:17.357 --> 14:19.859
bring your brother and sister
down with you.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.115
Get it together, Kevin.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.412
<i>KEVIN:</i>
<i>Building this house was</i>
<i>the one good thing that I did.</i>

14:30.495 --> 14:32.205
It was the one good thing.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.461
And I'm-I'm gonna honor
her wishes if it kills me.

14:40.505 --> 14:41.715
-KATE: Kev, don't go.
-I'm not going.

14:41.798 --> 14:42.841
I'm getting more walnut shrimp.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.350
KEVIN:
Yes!

14:55.020 --> 14:56.521
(Jack grunts)

14:59.607 --> 15:00.900
Hey, what's going on?

15:00.984 --> 15:02.861
-REBECCA: What's up, bud?
-I lost another tooth!

15:02.944 --> 15:05.655
-REBECCA: Oh!
-JACK: You-- That makes seven
for you,

15:05.739 --> 15:07.949
five for Randall, and...

15:08.033 --> 15:09.492
Zero for me.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.869
That's okay, Katie girl,

15:10.952 --> 15:12.704
'cause you are gonna be young
forever.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.956
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)
-Okay? You're gonna be young
forever.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.335
But somebody's getting a visit
from the tooth fairy tonight.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.545
-REBECCA: Ooh!
-Yeah, and I'm gonna catch her.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.380
-Huh?
-What do you mean catch her?

15:22.464 --> 15:23.840
I'm gonna stay up all night,

15:23.923 --> 15:26.468
and when she flies in here,
I'm gonna catch her.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.803
-Hmm.
-Okay.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.638
I want pancakes.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.307
-Me, too!
-Okay.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.601
-(chuckles)
-I guess I'll make pancakes.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.686
(chuckles):
Yeah.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.605
What's going on, bud?

15:38.688 --> 15:41.608
I always have bad dreams
when the tooth fairy comes.

15:41.691 --> 15:44.235
I don't want her in my room.
She's a stranger.

15:44.319 --> 15:47.113
Well, she's not really
a stranger.

15:47.197 --> 15:48.907
(clicks tongue)

15:48.990 --> 15:50.533
I know her.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.118
I've gone to lunch with her
a couple times.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.204
We've even gone to see
some movies together.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.378
Okay, can I tell you
a little secret?

16:01.461 --> 16:03.380
Come here.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.049
Now, this is something that most
parents don't tell their kids

16:06.132 --> 16:07.300
until they're much older,

16:07.384 --> 16:08.802
so you cannot tell
your brother or sister.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.304
I don't want to ruin the magic
for them, okay?

16:11.388 --> 16:14.391
I think this'll make you
feel better, though.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.768
(whispers inaudibly)

16:20.980 --> 16:23.692
-Really?
-Really.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.653
But that has to stay
between us, okay?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.490
(chuckles softly)

16:32.909 --> 16:34.703
I can squeeze my meetings
into two days most weeks

16:34.786 --> 16:36.121
so I can spend
more time with her.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.623
No, no, Randall, this is
the opposite of what she wanted.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.501
-Remember her
Thanksgiving speech?
-Yeah, I know what she said.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.878
"You will not make your lives
smaller because of me.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.755
"This thing
that is happening to me

16:45.839 --> 16:46.965
will not be the thing
that holds you..."

16:47.048 --> 16:49.259
I know what she said, Kevin.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.386
But I also know her.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.180
She would understand how we
would have to change the plan.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.390
You can take my word for it.

16:55.473 --> 16:56.766
I don't need to take
your word for it.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.560
I can take her word for it.
She said it.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.606
No, I-I know, I know, you guys
have had this really special--

17:03.690 --> 17:05.734
I think twisted-- relationship
where y-you whisper

17:05.817 --> 17:08.611
-your soul secrets to each other
your whole lives...
-"Soul secrets."

17:08.695 --> 17:11.072
...but that doesn't give you the
right to override her wishes.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.533
Especially when she left Kate
in charge.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.243
Yeah, well,
Kate's barely said a word.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.748
(stammers, sighs)

17:21.750 --> 17:23.293
Sorry, Kate, I just...

17:23.376 --> 17:25.628
What I meant was,

17:25.712 --> 17:28.131
no one should have to make
this kind of decision alone.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.342
Right. Got it.

17:39.684 --> 17:43.438
Hi. Thought maybe we could
paint our nails together.

17:43.521 --> 17:44.522
Really?

17:44.606 --> 17:47.525
Yeah. Come on.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.945
We'll do our nails and gossip.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.781
You know, woman to woman.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.158
Come here. Let me see that hand.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.621
So talk to me. What's going on?

17:59.704 --> 18:02.624
(sighs)
They're always ahead of me.

18:02.707 --> 18:05.251
Kevin's better at board games.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.170
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.
-Randall's better at reading.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.589
And they're both better
at losing their teeth.

18:09.673 --> 18:13.968
Oh. Bug, come on,
don't worry about your brothers.

18:14.052 --> 18:18.348
You are just,
you're a late bloomer.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.558
Do you know what that means?

18:20.642 --> 18:23.103
(chuckles) It means
that it might take you

18:23.186 --> 18:25.355
a little bit more time to do
some things than other people,

18:25.438 --> 18:27.857
but when you're ready? Ugh.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.235
You're gonna leave them
all in the dust.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.112
Well, maybe Kevin.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.530
(laughs)

18:33.613 --> 18:35.240
All right,
let me finish your hand.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.411
KEVIN:
How'd they get it to purr
like that, you know?

18:39.494 --> 18:41.621
It's... Hmm.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.039
Hi, Mom.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.834
Oh. Hello.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.670
LAILA:
Rebecca wanted to put
some makeup on all by herself.

18:51.256 --> 18:52.340
KATE:
Oh.

18:53.508 --> 18:54.843
You look beautiful.

18:54.926 --> 18:58.013
That eye shadow really
complements your eye color.

18:58.096 --> 18:59.639
Thank you.

18:59.723 --> 19:01.975
I wanted to let you know I'm
gonna take your mom on a walk.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.768
Oh.

19:03.852 --> 19:07.772
Mom, can I, uh,
take that walk with you?

19:07.856 --> 19:09.941
Sure. That sounds nice.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.527
Okay. Well, I've got it,
if you want to take lunch.

19:12.610 --> 19:14.612
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

19:15.864 --> 19:17.824
Why don't we go and see

19:17.907 --> 19:19.701
if there are any apples
on the tree?

19:19.784 --> 19:21.703
Huh. Hmm.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.590
That's not our mom, Kev.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.384
No, it's not.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.013
Our mother was magic.

19:45.143 --> 19:48.146
<i>She always knew exactly</i>
<i>what each one of us needed.</i>

20:05.538 --> 20:06.956
<i>I'm sure she meant well.</i>

20:07.040 --> 20:10.418
Sitting us down
and sharing her wishes with us.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.714
But she couldn't have imagined
what this would feel like.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.842
She couldn't have imagined
how deep the need would be

20:17.926 --> 20:20.637
to pay her back
for everything she did.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.307
To do right
by what's left of her.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.809
(ragged exhale)

20:27.811 --> 20:30.730
It's a beautiful house, man,

20:30.814 --> 20:33.525
but I'm not gonna leave her
in it all alone.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.111
And nothing you say
can change my mind.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.004
"Good night, stars.
Good night, air.

20:54.087 --> 20:57.007
Good night, noises everywhere."

21:00.010 --> 21:03.680
Okay, Kate, so Dad's
on a site visit in New Jersey

21:03.763 --> 21:05.765
and I have been up
with you guys since 4:30,

21:05.849 --> 21:08.143
so I'm gonna bring you
to your room

21:08.226 --> 21:10.103
and I really, really, really
need you to go to sleep

21:10.186 --> 21:11.604
and not wake up your brothers.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.735
(exhales)
All right, here we go.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.407
(Kate crying)

21:29.164 --> 21:31.166
(Rebecca sighs)

21:33.376 --> 21:35.503
(laughs softly)

21:35.587 --> 21:38.214
So, that is Abby, Sid's sister.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.176
And she is having an affair
with Richard.

21:41.259 --> 21:44.763
Oh, and then Gary is having
an affair with Judy.

21:44.846 --> 21:48.892
And Laura is having an affair
with her boss Scooter.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.810
(sniffs)

21:50.894 --> 21:53.772
Mmm, this is really nice.

21:53.855 --> 21:55.857
(TV continues indistinctly)

21:58.568 --> 22:00.362
(Kate crying)

22:02.947 --> 22:05.158
(gasps)
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.161
Kate, sweetheart, are you okay?

22:08.244 --> 22:10.372
Are you okay, baby girl?
I'm so sorry.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.790
Mommy's so sorry.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.501
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

22:14.584 --> 22:17.003
Oh, my goodness.

22:17.087 --> 22:18.421
(birds chirping)

22:18.505 --> 22:21.675
Oh, look at that hummingbird.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.385
I think there's
like a whole family.

22:25.553 --> 22:26.971
Sweet.

22:29.057 --> 22:32.394
♪ ♪

22:37.065 --> 22:39.359
I could crush some wonton soup.

22:39.442 --> 22:41.903
Oh, they probably ordered
the good Chinese by now.

22:41.986 --> 22:43.530
Oh, they so did.

22:44.781 --> 22:46.116
Maybe we could go get some.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.284
Mm-mm, and get sucked
back into their drama?

22:48.368 --> 22:49.577
It's not worth it.

22:52.747 --> 22:54.290
Do you think
Randall's stormed off yet?

22:54.374 --> 22:57.043
-(chuckles) Ages ago.
-(both laugh)

22:57.127 --> 22:59.879
Yeah, it's hilarious, isn't it?

22:59.963 --> 23:03.758
Their mother is slowly dying
from this horrific disease,

23:03.842 --> 23:07.137
and you two can predict
what miserable happenings

23:07.220 --> 23:09.931
are taking place
as they debate her care.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.433
What a hoot.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.813
You know, Phil,
I've been a part of this family

23:16.896 --> 23:19.733
for over 30 years.

23:19.816 --> 23:23.028
And so, yeah, sometimes
I-I hole up and blow off steam,

23:23.111 --> 23:25.030
because they can
drive me a little nuts,

23:25.113 --> 23:29.200
with their feelings
and their speeches

23:29.284 --> 23:32.287
and their always wanting to move
somebody into your damn house.

23:33.747 --> 23:36.541
I don't know, it's like...

23:36.624 --> 23:42.380
sometimes I think
it's been the greatest burden

23:42.464 --> 23:44.341
and the greatest blessing
of my life,

23:44.424 --> 23:46.801
being a part of this family.

23:46.885 --> 23:48.303
(exhales)
Same, same.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.808
Would you say it was, like,
equal parts burden and blessing?

23:53.892 --> 23:55.477
Or is it more like, 60-40?

23:55.560 --> 23:58.563
Oh, depends on the day,
Big Phil.

23:58.646 --> 24:00.482
Depends on the day.

24:02.400 --> 24:04.819
Wasn't that a beautiful walk?

24:09.908 --> 24:12.702
Mom, do you mind if I sit here
until you fall asleep?

24:14.329 --> 24:17.707
Okay. Whatever you want, dear.

24:18.833 --> 24:19.959
Okay.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.837
Where were we?

24:22.921 --> 24:24.923
Let's see.

24:27.759 --> 24:31.388
"So she sat by the river,
thinking about what she said."

24:31.471 --> 24:32.722
(cries softly)

24:34.724 --> 24:37.268
Hi, Dr. K,
this is Rebecca Pearson.

24:37.352 --> 24:39.562
Um, you delivered my babies.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.773
(exhales) I know you're not
in the office right now,

24:41.856 --> 24:44.609
but I thought you might check
your messages at night.

24:44.693 --> 24:47.529
So, my daughter Kate
fell off the bed.

24:47.612 --> 24:52.826
Um, I just took my eyes off
of her for one minute and, um...

24:52.909 --> 24:54.786
I-I called the emergency clinic,
and they told me

24:54.869 --> 24:57.414
as long as she's acting normal,
just to keep a close eye on her,

24:57.497 --> 24:59.082
but it doesn't feel
like it's enough.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.167
I-I know you're not
a pediatrician,

25:01.251 --> 25:03.586
but I know you also work
with a lot of babies,

25:03.670 --> 25:06.381
and-and I trust you.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.342
<i>I thought you might have</i>
<i>some good advice for me</i>

25:09.426 --> 25:11.928
<i>because I don't...</i>
<i>I don't really know what to do</i>

25:12.012 --> 25:14.806
<i>and I'm all by myself here.</i>

25:14.889 --> 25:17.350
<i>(exhales) So, could you</i>
<i>please call me back?</i>

25:17.434 --> 25:19.519
(Kate crying)

25:19.602 --> 25:21.438
"...at the same time."

25:30.280 --> 25:32.449
(line ringing)

25:32.532 --> 25:34.784
<i>-TOBY (over phone): Hey.</i>
-Hey.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.494
I'm calling to check
on the kids.

25:36.578 --> 25:38.455
<i>-How's it going?</i>
-Yeah, good.

25:38.538 --> 25:41.332
Laura and I took the kids
to that new brunch spot,

25:41.416 --> 25:43.460
and it turns out
that Hailey's new favorite food

25:43.543 --> 25:45.295
is huevos rancheros.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.131
God, our kids have great taste.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.966
Yeah. How's it going over there?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.468
(sighs)

25:51.551 --> 25:53.094
Not great.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.263
She can't remember
that Miguel is gone.

25:55.347 --> 25:57.766
Ah. I'm sorry.

25:57.849 --> 26:00.185
Yeah, so we're trying
to figure out what to do next,

26:00.268 --> 26:02.395
and Randall and Kevin are
at each other's throats, I...

26:02.479 --> 26:06.608
Yeah, but that's technically
up to you, right?

26:06.691 --> 26:09.235
-I mean, she appointed you
her guardian.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

26:09.319 --> 26:11.446
(exhales)
Yeah, I don't know.

26:11.529 --> 26:13.281
I can't decide
what's best, Tobe.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.325
Um...

26:17.327 --> 26:18.870
Permission to overstep,

26:18.953 --> 26:22.415
as your former husband/
current co-parent?

26:22.499 --> 26:25.043
(laughs softly)
Permission granted.

26:26.336 --> 26:29.297
Kate, you are, in every way,

26:29.381 --> 26:31.633
what the kids
refer to as a baller.

26:31.716 --> 26:34.260
<i>All right? You got</i>
<i>your master's in education,</i>

26:34.344 --> 26:36.012
you're designing
an arts curriculum

26:36.096 --> 26:37.681
for the friggin' state
of California.

26:37.764 --> 26:40.600
All while mom-ing
and wife-ing up a storm.

26:40.684 --> 26:43.395
<i>But when you get around</i>
<i>your brothers... (sighs)</i>

26:43.478 --> 26:48.233
I don't know, you become this
unsteady version of yourself.

26:49.317 --> 26:53.363
<i>And I just, I don't get it.</i>

26:53.446 --> 26:55.448
Yeah. I don't either.

26:57.367 --> 26:59.577
Your mom chose you
for a reason, Kate.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.873
Thank you, Tobe.

27:03.957 --> 27:07.460
Oh, my God,
should we get back together?

27:07.544 --> 27:10.088
Okay, good night, Toby.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.506
I'll talk to you later.

27:11.589 --> 27:12.924
Good night.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.144
(Kate cooing)

27:26.146 --> 27:29.899
Hey, baby girl. Hey, there.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.277
How are you feeling, huh?

27:32.360 --> 27:35.655
You okay? Come here, Kate.

27:35.739 --> 27:38.324
Oh, yeah, you're okay.

27:38.408 --> 27:40.326
You're okay. Oh, God.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.746
Thank God. Ugh.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.414
You're smiling at Mama.

27:44.497 --> 27:47.917
Oh, Kate, you know
exactly what Mommy needed.

27:57.052 --> 27:58.303
JACK (distant):
Rebecca?

27:58.386 --> 27:59.429
(Rebecca groans)

27:59.512 --> 28:02.349
Hey, Bec, I need help.

28:02.432 --> 28:04.559
What is it?

28:04.642 --> 28:07.187
You know I haven't had more than
two hours of sleep in weeks?

28:07.270 --> 28:10.023
I know. We-we have a situation.

28:10.106 --> 28:13.360
Kevin. Ugh, it's everywhere.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.237
It's like he went and then
made a snow angel in it,

28:16.321 --> 28:18.114
-but instead of snow, it's...
-I get it.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.367
Yeah, can-can you go
get the trash can

28:20.450 --> 28:23.036
and-and run a bath, please?

28:23.119 --> 28:25.080
(sighs)

28:29.125 --> 28:31.336
-I was never here.
-Mm-hmm.

28:36.758 --> 28:39.678
Hey, baby. Can we talk?

28:40.720 --> 28:42.389
Yeah, we can talk.

28:42.472 --> 28:47.352
So, I've been thinking about
this a lot lately, and, um...

28:47.435 --> 28:49.646
And you want to move Rebecca
into our house.

28:50.814 --> 28:53.566
I don't see
another option here, Beth.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.819
She needs to be around family,

28:55.902 --> 28:57.821
and I need to be
the one in charge

28:57.904 --> 29:00.573
of the day-to-day decisions
about her care.

29:00.657 --> 29:03.326
Kate's overwhelmed. This is
clearly too much for her.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.412
And Kevin says he'll come visit
every couple of weeks,

29:05.495 --> 29:06.996
but who knows if that's true?

29:07.080 --> 29:08.581
He could be off in New Zealand

29:08.665 --> 29:10.750
filming the new <i>Avatar 7</i>
at the drop of a hat.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.712
Randall,

29:13.795 --> 29:16.131
don't underestimate your sister.

29:16.214 --> 29:19.217
She has had to navigate
her larger-than-life brothers

29:19.300 --> 29:22.137
and their massive egos
her entire life.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.097
And that is a load
to carry, too.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.724
(laughter)

29:25.807 --> 29:27.142
And look at your brother
over there.

29:27.225 --> 29:29.686
-Like, look at him.
-KEVIN (distant): Careful.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.980
BETH:
He is not
the irresponsible screwup

29:32.063 --> 29:34.899
that you knew
growing up, Randall.

29:34.983 --> 29:38.611
Like, I hear you talking
about them, and, baby,

29:38.695 --> 29:42.949
you are talking about versions
of them that no longer exist.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.372
MADISON:
We had the best time.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.124
-The town is so cute...
-Yeah?

29:51.207 --> 29:53.626
-...the air is so crisp.
-Oh, you don't realize

29:53.710 --> 29:56.129
how bad L.A. smog is
until you breathe real air.

29:56.212 --> 29:58.006
-I've been saying that. Yeah.
-(laughs): Yeah.

29:58.089 --> 30:00.091
Have fun. Breathe it in.

30:06.348 --> 30:09.559
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:11.561 --> 30:12.896
Are you okay?

30:14.981 --> 30:17.359
Yeah. Yeah.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.695
Kevin.

30:20.779 --> 30:23.531
Um...

30:23.615 --> 30:25.617
You know, my mom used
to talk about this day

30:25.700 --> 30:27.911
from back when we were younger.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.622
It's a lazy Saturday,
you know, lazy Saturday

30:30.705 --> 30:34.209
with nothing to do,
no one had anywhere to be.

30:34.292 --> 30:38.588
We'd all just, um,
watch old movies together,

30:38.672 --> 30:42.258
play foursquare,
pin the tail on the donkey.

30:44.427 --> 30:47.972
I don't know, I had this
stupid idea that...

30:48.056 --> 30:50.100
building this house
could somehow recreate

30:50.183 --> 30:52.602
that for her, you know,
with us and all the grandkids.

30:52.686 --> 30:54.396
That's not stupid at all.

30:56.564 --> 30:57.982
I don't know.

30:59.984 --> 31:01.736
(sighs)

31:01.820 --> 31:03.822
Randall wants
to move her to Philly.

31:06.324 --> 31:07.742
I've been fighting him
on it all day, but...

31:09.744 --> 31:12.455
...maybe he's right.

31:12.539 --> 31:14.666
Maybe he's right,
maybe-maybe keeping her here,

31:14.749 --> 31:17.502
without all of us here,
maybe that's not what's best

31:17.585 --> 31:19.421
for her, you know? I...

31:21.423 --> 31:22.590
I don't know.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.428
I got to get this one right.

31:32.350 --> 31:33.685
KATE:
Hey.

31:33.768 --> 31:35.687
Let's get Randall.
We have to talk.

31:41.943 --> 31:45.238
I will make a decision
about what's best for Mom

31:45.321 --> 31:47.741
because she trusted me to do it.

31:47.824 --> 31:53.163
But first you two have got
to be able to look at her.

31:54.581 --> 31:57.375
What are you talking about?

31:57.459 --> 31:59.210
We look at her all the time.

31:59.294 --> 32:02.589
No, you don't, Randall.

32:03.673 --> 32:04.674
And I get it.

32:04.758 --> 32:08.136
I get it,
because Mom was magnificent.

32:08.219 --> 32:12.223
And to see her like this
is really brutal.

32:12.307 --> 32:14.934
But how can we even talk about
her moving into your house

32:15.018 --> 32:17.645
when you can't even
look her in the eye?

32:19.522 --> 32:22.400
And, Kev, you're touching her
less and less.

32:25.695 --> 32:28.198
Come with me.

32:28.281 --> 32:29.491
Let's go.

32:31.493 --> 32:33.536
Wash, wash, wash.

32:33.620 --> 32:35.580
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.248
Mommy's got you.

32:37.332 --> 32:39.167
Mommy's got you. Yeah.

32:41.294 --> 32:42.504
Here. Brush her hair.

32:42.587 --> 32:44.339
Just be gentle
around the tangles.

32:44.422 --> 32:46.508
I have daughters.
I know how to brush.

32:46.591 --> 32:48.385
Okay.

32:48.468 --> 32:50.053
RANDALL:
Here we go, Mom.

32:57.477 --> 32:59.229
Kev, her hands are dry.

33:04.776 --> 33:07.654
(clicking)

33:07.737 --> 33:08.947
(softly):
Okay, let me see...

33:32.512 --> 33:34.514
(timer ticking)

33:39.269 --> 33:41.104
(timer chimes)

33:47.318 --> 33:49.654
Pregnant.

33:49.738 --> 33:51.656
How do you feel?

33:51.740 --> 33:54.492
I feel...

33:54.576 --> 33:56.202
hungry.

33:58.413 --> 33:59.789
(TV playing indistinctly)

34:01.791 --> 34:03.418
I'm not ready.

34:03.501 --> 34:04.627
You seemed pretty ready
that night

34:04.711 --> 34:06.671
-in the bathroom at Froggy's.
-Uh...

34:06.755 --> 34:10.008
I was caught up in the moment.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.718
Look, Bec...

34:13.720 --> 34:14.929
...we can do this.

34:16.306 --> 34:19.976
It-It's just one
tiny little baby.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.269
Two of us.

34:23.688 --> 34:26.816
One baby...

34:26.900 --> 34:28.526
two of us.

34:29.527 --> 34:32.405
(overlapping chatter)

34:32.489 --> 34:34.366
-Here you go.
-I mean, that's what
you're supposed...

34:34.449 --> 34:38.078
Okay, is-is it bad
that we had Chinese yesterday

34:38.161 --> 34:39.913
for lunch and dinner, and now
we're eating it for breakfast?

34:39.996 --> 34:41.664
-Not one bit.
-Not for me.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.583
I love it.

34:44.751 --> 34:47.671
Um, okay, I, um...

34:47.754 --> 34:51.758
have an announcement to make
while the kids are off playing,

34:51.841 --> 34:53.176
about Mom.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.387
What, now? With everyone here?

34:55.470 --> 34:56.805
Yes.

34:56.888 --> 35:00.016
They're our family,
and they should be a part of it.

35:03.561 --> 35:04.896
(clears throat)

35:04.979 --> 35:07.732
Okay, um...

35:07.816 --> 35:09.359
Mom moving to Philly
to live with you

35:09.442 --> 35:10.777
is not an option, Randall.

35:10.860 --> 35:13.613
You'd have to pull back
on your work in D.C.,

35:13.697 --> 35:15.657
and that's exactly
what Mom didn't want.

35:15.740 --> 35:17.242
So I can't allow it.

35:18.576 --> 35:19.911
And Kev.

35:19.994 --> 35:22.831
Keeping her here,
without family,

35:22.914 --> 35:24.332
we're not gonna do that either.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.461
Philip and I had
a long talk last night,

35:28.545 --> 35:30.422
and we are going
to bring her to L.A.

35:30.505 --> 35:35.343
And we are gonna find
the best place for her to live.

35:35.427 --> 35:37.595
Whether it's in
an incredible facility

35:37.679 --> 35:39.514
or if she's gonna
move in with us.

35:49.733 --> 35:52.110
Can I offer up another idea?

35:53.653 --> 35:54.863
Okay.

35:58.450 --> 36:02.328
That thing you did yesterday,
having us look at her,

36:02.412 --> 36:05.165
it helped me.

36:05.248 --> 36:09.336
And I'm gonna honor
whatever your wishes are.

36:09.419 --> 36:12.297
But I now know
what the new plan should be.

36:14.174 --> 36:16.926
-Okay.
-Okay.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.262
Well...
(clears throat)

36:19.346 --> 36:21.890
Sophie and I were up all night
talking as well,

36:21.973 --> 36:26.102
and, uh, we would
like to move here.

36:26.186 --> 36:27.771
And live with Mom.

36:30.231 --> 36:33.485
You know, I never really
liked it in L.A. anyway, so...

36:38.448 --> 36:40.658
Big Three Homes is based
on the East Coast,

36:40.742 --> 36:43.536
<i>The Manny</i> stops shooting
next week, so...

36:43.620 --> 36:46.664
Yeah, okay, I think
that's an amazing offer, but...

36:46.748 --> 36:49.793
I can't allow you to move away
from your children.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.294
MADISON:
He won't be.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.508
Elijah's job is remote,

36:56.591 --> 36:59.260
and all of his family
is in New Jersey.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.262
And we have been
talking for a while

37:01.346 --> 37:03.556
about wanting
to be closer to them.

37:03.640 --> 37:05.767
To be honest,
Kevin was pretty much

37:05.850 --> 37:07.936
the only thing keeping
our family in L.A.

37:08.019 --> 37:10.063
(laughs softly)

37:10.146 --> 37:12.273
KATE:
Oh.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.651
I don't know.
I still feel like...

37:14.734 --> 37:18.029
It's just so much
to do all alone.

37:18.113 --> 37:19.322
-I...
-NICKY: They won't be alone.

37:20.865 --> 37:23.660
I mean, we're gonna
be here, right?

37:23.743 --> 37:26.663
We're not gonna do the showers
and all that gross stuff,

37:26.746 --> 37:28.456
-but we will be here.
-(soft laughter)

37:28.540 --> 37:32.335
Plus, Edie's actually turned
out to be a half-decent cook.

37:32.419 --> 37:33.962
And Nicky has actually
turned out to be

37:34.045 --> 37:35.588
a half-decent human being.

37:35.672 --> 37:37.757
(laughter)

37:37.841 --> 37:40.427
We have an opportunity here
to give Mom

37:40.510 --> 37:44.514
exactly what she wanted,
for her and for us.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.395
What do you say?

37:56.901 --> 37:58.111
Okay.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.240
Randall,

38:02.323 --> 38:05.410
I know you're probably thinking
I'm not up for it, but...

38:06.494 --> 38:08.329
...I am.

38:27.223 --> 38:29.267
Thank you.

38:32.020 --> 38:35.023
KATE:
Okay. Well, great.

38:35.106 --> 38:38.943

38:40.653 --> 38:42.322

this was the reason all along.

38:48.328 --> 38:50.372
