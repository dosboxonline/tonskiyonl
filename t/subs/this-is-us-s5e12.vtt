what are you doing here?

00:14.889 --> 00:16.599
There is a job at Jack's school.

00:16.683 --> 00:18.018
I already talked to Dr. Salzman.
She said

Hey, so I got the hot chocolate.

-Uh-huh.
-I got the corn syrup for the candied apples.

01:08.443 --> 01:09.819
with Rebecca in her apartment.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.279
It's exactly the kind of romantic gesture

01:11.363 --> 01:13.156
that makes other guys hate you.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.450
-Come on. Other guys don't hate me.
-Yeah, they do.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.660
Anyways, did, uh, you ever end up

09:11.718 --> 09:13.136
It's-it's stuck.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.388
The ring is...
What do you mean, the ring is...?

09:15.472 --> 09:16.806
-Ow! Oh, it's pinching.
-Okay...

09:16.890 --> 09:18.391
Just stop moving!

09:18.475 --> 09:20.101
Why did you make me
use the real thing, huh?

09:20.185 --> 09:21.811
Why did you put it all the way on there?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.229
I didn't know you had a huge knuckle.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.148
S... You can stop right there.
Ow!

09:25.231 --> 09:26.483
-Okay.
-You know what? This actually happened

09:26.566 --> 09:28.068
-on <i>I Love Lucy.</i>
-Did it?

09:28.151 --> 09:29.486
-Yeah.
-Here. Just keep... keep it elevated.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.071
-Keep it elevated.
-What's that gonna do?

09:31.154 --> 09:32.530
Blood drains!

09:32.614 --> 09:35.283
It was a very good proposal, Jack.

09:35.367 --> 09:38.411
I would have said yes.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.872
All right.
So, Madison and the babies are

09:40.955 --> 09:42.707
at the park with Toby, which is great,

09:42.791 --> 09:44.125
'cause it gives us
a couple hours to wedding-plan

09:44.209 --> 09:46.628
without being crapped on or spit up on.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.004
Well, I hope your fiancée works that out

09:48.088 --> 09:49.381
-before you marry her.
-(laughs)

09:49.464 --> 09:51.966
All right, first order of business is, uh,

09:52.050 --> 09:55.011
I got to email Randall
and ask him to be my best man.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.472
Email him?
Really?

09:57.555 --> 09:59.641
Doesn't that seem a little impersonal?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.142
Just-just call him.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.061
Yeah.
You know, I-I thought... I...

10:03.144 --> 10:05.021
-I want to get the words right, you know? Mm...
-(door opens)

10:05.105 --> 10:06.856
Hey, guys.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.818
-Have no fear. M.C. Rivas is here.
-KEVIN: Nice.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.112
Hey, Miguel, Uncle Nicky's excited

10:12.195 --> 10:14.155
to dive into rehearsal dinner
planning with you,

10:14.239 --> 10:16.157
so just ignore me.

10:16.241 --> 10:19.953
Nicky, I am thrilled to have you
aboard the planning committee.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.454
Dinner.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.206
I'm thinking small plates.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.250
Really?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.335
Won't that be hard to fit the food on?

10:27.419 --> 10:29.295
Oh, uh, no. The...

10:29.379 --> 10:32.424
So, the plates-- they're not really small.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.884
Uh, it's basically a bunch of appetizers

10:34.968 --> 10:36.886
that add up to a full meal.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.346
And that way, people can help themselves

10:38.430 --> 10:40.348
-to as much as they want.
-Well, you're no stranger

10:40.432 --> 10:41.599
to helping yourself to whatever you want.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.560
What was that?

10:43.643 --> 10:46.312
Hmm?
What about pigs in a blanket?

10:46.396 --> 10:48.231
I do love pigs in a blanket,

10:48.314 --> 10:49.941
but I was thinking salmon crostini,

10:50.025 --> 10:51.943
bacon-wrapped dates and...

10:52.027 --> 10:53.194
(Italian accent):
bruschetta.

10:54.279 --> 10:55.697
Hey, kid.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.615
Hey! Kid!

10:57.699 --> 10:58.908
Huh?

10:58.992 --> 11:00.702
Do you want small, fancy food

11:00.785 --> 11:02.328
or regular-sized, good food?

11:03.413 --> 11:05.373
(chuckles)

11:05.457 --> 11:07.959
Hey, I...
You know, it's up to you guys.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.337
So, I don't think we need anything crusty.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.006
-Cr... Uh, crus... It's not crusty.
-NICKY: No.

11:13.089 --> 11:14.382
-MIGUEL: It's crostini. It's...
-NICKY: You know,

11:14.466 --> 11:16.259
it doesn't sound good at all.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.094
MIGUEL: It's got salm...
Look, let me show you a picture of it.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.638
Maybe you'll-you'll get it a little.
S-See how...

11:23.892 --> 11:26.019
KATE:
Oh. Hi!

11:26.102 --> 11:27.479
Hey, uh, can I help you with that?

11:27.562 --> 11:30.357
No. It's fine.
I'm, uh, already done.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.609
You know, I like to get here
an hour early,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.819
settle in.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.738
I see you're more of a...

11:36.821 --> 11:39.199
-"minute to spare" type of person.
-Sorry.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.076
I just... It was hard
for me to tear myself away

11:41.159 --> 11:44.162
from my kids this morning,
but I'm sure it'll get easier.

11:44.245 --> 11:47.082
Right? And I'm really excited
to be working with you.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.417
This job is a dream,
and I still cannot believe

11:49.501 --> 11:52.462
-I got it. (chuckles)
-Yeah.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.134
All right!
Good morning, drummers.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.219
Good morning, good morning.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.596
(drumming)

12:01.680 --> 12:03.139
Mom, do you know the difference

12:03.223 --> 12:06.184
between agender and bi-gender?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.728
Bethany, Alex is a teenager,

12:08.812 --> 12:11.106
not the gender police.
Relax.

12:11.189 --> 12:14.234
And yes, I do.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.320
-I'm a woman of the times.
-(doorbell rings)

12:25.495 --> 12:27.872
-TESS: Hey.
-ALEX: Hi.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.211
TESS:
Mom, Mama C,

12:33.294 --> 12:34.754
-this is Alex.
-Hi.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.423
Uh, it's so nice to meet you guys.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.550
Great to meet you, Alex.
Popper?

12:38.633 --> 12:40.468
-Ooh, yes, please.
-Uh, we'll eat them upstairs.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.512
-We need to go study.
-All right.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.518
I hope they leave us some poppers.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.027
JASE: Welcome, everyone.
Welcome, welcome.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.363
So, for those of you
who do not know me, I'm Jase.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.532
And I just want
to say this up front:

13:02.615 --> 13:05.910
this is a transracial adoptee
support group.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.955
This is not the Harry Potter Alliance.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.707
Last month there was a little mix-up,

13:10.790 --> 13:13.877
and we had a bunch
of very disappointed dudes

13:13.960 --> 13:16.087
-with wands.
-(all laugh)

13:16.171 --> 13:17.881
Nothing wrong with that.

13:17.964 --> 13:21.426
So, we've got, uh,
two new additions today, right?

13:21.509 --> 13:23.345
Uh, yeah.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.347
Uh, Randall Pearson.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.973
Thrilled to be here.

13:27.057 --> 13:30.018
Uh, Andrew Levin.
Nice to meet you all.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.979
So, which one of you want
to plunge in into the deep end

13:33.063 --> 13:34.814
and tell us about yourselves?

13:34.898 --> 13:37.233
Uh, okay.
Sure.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.319
Um... I mean,

13:39.402 --> 13:40.987
-if you don't mind?
-No, please. Go for it.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.448
Uh...
(chuckles softly)

13:43.531 --> 13:45.158
Where do I start?
Um,

13:45.241 --> 13:48.411
I grew up in Newton, Massachusetts.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.413
Super white,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.874
upper-middle-class, Jewish parents.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.126
It was actually
shortly after my bar mitzvah

13:55.210 --> 13:57.379
that my depression started.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.508
Something about staring out
at all those faces.

14:01.591 --> 14:04.469
A whole congregation of people
that looked nothing like me.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.680
It shook me.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.517
Anyway, I've gotten it
mostly under control, but...

14:10.600 --> 14:13.603
I have this need to keep proving myself

14:13.687 --> 14:15.855
that never goes away.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.945
So, here I am.

14:23.488 --> 14:25.448
Thank you for sharing, Andrew.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.702
The mailman was the first Black man

14:28.785 --> 14:30.120
I saw in our neighborhood.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.372
And I used to think,

14:32.455 --> 14:35.166
<i>"Is that him?</i>

14:35.250 --> 14:36.710
<i>Is that my real father?"</i>

14:36.793 --> 14:40.088
At night, I would pray
for my birth mother to find me.

14:40.171 --> 14:43.133
But then my adopted mom
would come tuck me in,

14:43.216 --> 14:44.801
<i>and...</i>

14:44.884 --> 14:46.928
<i>You know, I would feel so guilty.</i>

14:49.681 --> 14:51.433
Randall.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.895
Anything you want to share, man?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.902
I'm good.
I just, uh...

15:02.986 --> 15:05.655
Would it be all right
if I just kept listening for a while?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.365
JASE:
Absolutely, man.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.576
Absolutely.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.248
-(groans)
-JACK: Maybe if we grease it, you know,

15:15.331 --> 15:16.416
like when a bolt gets stuck?

15:16.499 --> 15:17.417
Oh, that's a good idea.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.793
-Right?
-Yeah.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.713
You know, this is not
how I imagined my day going.

15:21.796 --> 15:23.465
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)
-(knock on door)

15:24.549 --> 15:26.134
Hey, I thought you said that Rebecca

15:26.217 --> 15:27.802
wasn't gonna be home for two hours.

15:27.886 --> 15:29.471
It's not Rebecca.
I mean, this is her house.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.389
She'd just walk in.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.352
Mr. Malone.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.896
Good to see you.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.148
<i>MIGUEL:</i>
<i>So, I was thinking</i>

15:40.231 --> 15:41.941
that after the cocktail hour,

15:42.025 --> 15:43.902
I will give my toast.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.821
Wait.
You're-you're gonna give a toast?

15:46.905 --> 15:49.074
Of course.
Yeah, I'm-I'm hosting.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.743
No, we're cohosting.

15:51.826 --> 15:54.537
Oh, really?
Uh, how much money are you kicking in

15:54.621 --> 15:57.499
to pay for cohosting this dinner?

15:59.709 --> 16:02.420
(sighs)
I'm sorry.

16:02.504 --> 16:06.216
It's just that all day,
you have been shooting down

16:06.299 --> 16:08.301
pretty much every idea that I've had,

16:08.385 --> 16:11.221
and it's just starting to wear down on me.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.098
No, no, it's kind of like
the way you wore down

16:13.181 --> 16:15.058
my brother's wife to get her to marry you.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.854
Excuse me?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.147
Nicky, what the hell, man?

16:21.231 --> 16:22.607
Oh, forget it.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.526
No.
I don't want to forget it.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.277
Go ahead.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.029
We're both grown men.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.115
Say what you're gonna say.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.493
It just doesn't sit with me, you know?

16:33.576 --> 16:35.537
I mean, my brother cuts me out of his life

16:35.620 --> 16:37.997
and replaces me with you,

16:38.081 --> 16:39.249
and then you come along,

16:39.332 --> 16:41.126
and you swoop in, and you marry his wife.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.467
"Swooped in"?

16:50.885 --> 16:54.889
I married Rebecca
13 years after Jack died.

16:56.307 --> 16:57.976
And if you're wondering whether or not

16:58.059 --> 17:00.395
I spend a few minutes every day

17:00.478 --> 17:03.898
wondering what Jack
might think about that,

17:03.982 --> 17:05.984
well, then, the answer is yes.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.485
I do.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.656
There's only one person
that I owe an explanation to,

17:11.740 --> 17:16.286
and that is the one person
that I can never give one to.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.749
I certainly don't owe one to you.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.752
(mouths)

17:27.589 --> 17:29.716
(kids laugh, scream)

17:29.799 --> 17:32.427
MADISON:
So, I have been to every park

17:32.510 --> 17:36.890
in a five-mile radius,
and this one is the best.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.141
(kids chattering)

17:38.224 --> 17:40.060
Aw, man, Patrick isn't here.

17:40.143 --> 17:42.771
He's my favorite of the stay-at-home dads.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.356
That's too bad.

17:44.439 --> 17:46.358
How's wedding planning going?

17:46.441 --> 17:49.444
Oh, fine.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.822
She said, staring sadly
off into the distance.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.575
-(chuckles softly)
-Just so you know, Madison,

17:55.658 --> 17:58.078
I promise, whatever you say
on the playground

17:58.161 --> 17:59.496
stays on the playground,

17:59.579 --> 18:01.081
as the saying goes.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.167
Ugh. It's stupid.
It's just, um...

18:05.251 --> 18:06.836
We picked a venue.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.880
It's beautiful.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.925
But, um, between us,

18:12.008 --> 18:13.968
it's not where I want to get married.

18:14.052 --> 18:16.721
Hmm.
What did Kevin say?

18:18.390 --> 18:20.266
Ah, you haven't told him.
Okay.

18:20.350 --> 18:24.562
Sometimes I have a hard time
saying what I want.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.941
Especially with, um... men.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.526
Mm-hmm.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.277
Also women.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.072
A little bit with children.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.451
I think I'm having a...

18:38.535 --> 18:39.786
I'm having a harder time

18:39.869 --> 18:41.663
with this whole "stay-at-home dad" thing.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.666
Much harder than I'm letting on to Kate.

18:45.709 --> 18:48.128
The thing is, I l... I loved my job.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.880
And I loved getting dressed up for it.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.591
I loved making coffee to take to it.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.593
I loved doing it.
You know, and I love my kids,

18:55.677 --> 18:58.013
but if I'm being honest...

18:58.096 --> 18:59.431
-(sighs)
-Hey.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.099
What you say at the playground
stays at the playground.

19:01.182 --> 19:02.851
I love my kids,

19:02.934 --> 19:05.061
but I don't love spending
ten hours a day with them.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.813
-Mm.
-I didn't mean that.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.065
I didn't mean that.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.525
I totally meant that.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.235
The couple of days that I've done it,

19:12.318 --> 19:17.157
time has moved very, very slowly.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.242
(breathes deeply)

19:19.325 --> 19:21.536
-Do you think I'm terrible?
-No.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.289
-No, I-I think you're honest.
-Yeah.

19:24.372 --> 19:25.790
Honest.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.377
Here at the Las Vegas of playgrounds.

19:31.421 --> 19:33.631
You should talk to her.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.051
You should talk to Kevin.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.386
-Puff?
-Please.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.180
-Want one of these?
-JACK: No.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.264
-TOBY: Want a cheese puff?
-(shakes puffs)

19:41.348 --> 19:42.640
-(phone vibrating)
-JACK: No. No.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.434
TOBY:
No? Can I eat all of them?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.687
Hey. So, my next class starts
in about two minutes.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.815
(sighs)
Listen, I'm sure that everything is fine

19:50.899 --> 19:52.817
and I'm just being crazy,
but can you please just...

19:52.901 --> 19:55.153
just text me back, let me know
that you guys are okay?

19:55.236 --> 19:56.654
Okay.

19:56.738 --> 19:58.698
Okay, I love you.
Bye.

20:01.576 --> 20:03.953
-PHILIP: Nice of you to join us.
-KATE: Sorry.

20:04.037 --> 20:07.374
-I...
-I don't need an apology. I need you to be present.

20:07.457 --> 20:09.084
(phone vibrates)

20:09.167 --> 20:10.585
KATE:
I'm sorry.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.712
This is really important.
Just one sec.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.885
(crying)

20:23.807 --> 20:25.475
What's wrong?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.310
Nothing.
Nothing.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.020
It's just, I told my husband to text me

20:29.104 --> 20:30.939
to make sure that the kids were okay,

20:31.022 --> 20:33.149
and he hadn't, and then...
I mean, he did.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.610
Sorry, has s... has something happened?

20:35.694 --> 20:37.946
No.
No, they're fine.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.280
<i>They're</i> fine.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.490
I am a total mess.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.325
Um, it's just I haven't

20:42.409 --> 20:44.536
been away from both of them for this long.

20:44.619 --> 20:45.954
(exhales)

20:47.163 --> 20:51.668
Kate, there were a lot
of applicants for this job,

20:51.751 --> 20:54.295
and you were not at the top of my list.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.923
I mean, you have no teaching experience,

20:57.007 --> 21:00.260
and you don't have a degree
in anything even adjacent to music.

21:00.343 --> 21:03.179
But Dr. Salzman loves your energy,

21:03.263 --> 21:05.682
so here we are.

21:06.766 --> 21:07.892
I get it.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.436
You love your kids.

21:09.519 --> 21:13.398
But if that means that you can't
be present for my students,

21:13.481 --> 21:15.859
this isn't gonna work.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.369
It's awful quiet up there.

21:26.453 --> 21:30.665
Studying is an inherently quiet activity.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.503
Where are Tess and Alex?
I wanted to say hi.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.714
-Oh, they're in her room.
-For real?

21:37.797 --> 21:40.133
How come they're allowed to be in her room

21:40.216 --> 21:42.260
with the door closed,
but Malik and I aren't?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.346
-Wait, hold up, the door's closed?
-Mm-hmm.

21:44.429 --> 21:47.057
Well, that is definitely not allowed.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.975
I mean, I think...

21:49.059 --> 21:51.770
-Right?
-You didn't discuss ground rules with Tess?

21:51.853 --> 21:55.565
I was very focused
on the pronouns and the poppers.

21:55.648 --> 21:57.525
But, um...

21:57.609 --> 21:59.152
No, I think it's only fair

21:59.235 --> 22:02.489
that Tess should have to follow
the same rules as Deja, so...

22:02.572 --> 22:04.157
I'm just...

22:04.240 --> 22:06.284
I'm just gonna go up and check on 'em.

22:06.368 --> 22:07.619
Bethany?

22:08.703 --> 22:10.955
Do tread lightly.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.463
(knocking)

22:18.546 --> 22:20.840
TESS (gasps):
Mom!

22:20.924 --> 22:22.342
What are you doing?

22:22.425 --> 22:24.344
I can't believe you
just barged in here like that.

22:24.427 --> 22:26.638
I didn't barge in.
I knocked.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.390
And I would like for the two of you

22:28.473 --> 22:30.183
to please relocate
to the couch downstairs, okay?

22:30.266 --> 22:32.811
-What? Why?
-ALEX: Hey, no.

22:32.894 --> 22:34.479
It's fine.

22:34.562 --> 22:35.563
(sighs)

22:35.647 --> 22:37.315
Okay.
Fine.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.401
(quietly):
Sorry she's such a psycho.

22:40.485 --> 22:42.112
What did you call me?

22:42.195 --> 22:44.406
I'm sorry.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.408
You know what, Alex?
I think maybe it's time for you

22:46.491 --> 22:48.868
to go home so I can
talk to my daughter about her rudeness.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.537
Mom, please.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.664
Hey, no.
It's okay.

22:52.747 --> 22:53.832
I'll see you soon.

22:57.836 --> 23:00.630
Tess, it's cool.

23:00.714 --> 23:01.798
Bye.

23:03.174 --> 23:05.010
That was mortifying.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.428
Maybe you should have thought about that

23:06.511 --> 23:07.971
before you called me out my name.

23:08.054 --> 23:09.514
Yeah, because that's
what you're mad about.

23:09.597 --> 23:11.599
What is that supposed to mean?

23:12.684 --> 23:14.978
Nothing.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.604
Tess?

23:18.106 --> 23:21.151
I saw the look on your face
when you opened the door.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.986
When you saw me with them.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.321
What look?
I didn't give a look.

23:26.406 --> 23:28.324
Sure.

23:33.204 --> 23:36.499
Oh.
Come in.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.797
(door creaks closed)

23:42.881 --> 23:44.716
JACK:
This is, uh,

23:44.799 --> 23:46.843
this is my friend Miguel.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.136
-He, um...
-Hey.

23:48.219 --> 23:51.306
he was helping me set up
for a proposal tonight.

23:51.389 --> 23:52.640
(Miguel chuckles softly)

23:52.724 --> 23:54.768
Yeah, we had a little snafu with the ring.

23:54.851 --> 23:56.353
-Yeah.
-Butter.

23:56.436 --> 23:58.980
Uh, so it's stuck.

23:59.064 --> 24:01.066
Good luck with that.

24:02.776 --> 24:05.904
Uh, look, Jack,
I'm sorry it took me so long

24:05.987 --> 24:07.947
to get back to you today.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.157
Um...

24:09.240 --> 24:11.493
I was just gathering my thoughts

24:11.576 --> 24:15.330
or, as my wife would say,
licking my wounds.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.333
Look...

24:18.416 --> 24:21.336
we both know Rebecca's
already made up her mind about you,

24:21.419 --> 24:24.506
with or without my blessing.

24:24.589 --> 24:26.424
So I will...

24:26.508 --> 24:30.053
do the best I can to be civil to you

24:30.136 --> 24:33.014
and to tolerate this marriage.

24:33.098 --> 24:36.518
And I wanted to tell you that man-to-man.

24:36.601 --> 24:38.978
I promised my wife I would.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.109
(takes deep breath):
So...

24:44.192 --> 24:47.654
now I'll let you get back
to whatever this is.

24:47.737 --> 24:48.780
No.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.867
I'm sorry, sir, that's just...

24:52.951 --> 24:55.245
-that's not good enough.
-You know, Miguel, let's just...

24:55.328 --> 24:58.915
Jack is not the kind of man
that you "tolerate"

24:58.998 --> 25:00.250
being married to your daughter.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.918
Jack is the kind of man that you thank

25:02.002 --> 25:03.545
your lucky stars that your daughter

25:03.628 --> 25:05.755
was lucky enough to meet, let alone marry.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.553
Did you know that Jack and I met
when he needed to buy a jacket

25:11.636 --> 25:13.179
just to get into your country club?

25:13.263 --> 25:15.724
I-I had never seen anybody

25:15.807 --> 25:17.475
look so serious about anything.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.812
I told him, "Just-just relax,
it's, it's just a jacket," but

25:20.895 --> 25:23.106
he said, "It's not about the jacket, man.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.483
"It's about the girl.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.527
"Everything that I do

25:27.610 --> 25:30.947
from this moment forward
is gonna be about the girl."

25:31.031 --> 25:33.241
And he meant it.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.951
It was about the girl

25:35.035 --> 25:37.203
when he worked his first
construction job for free

25:37.287 --> 25:39.205
because the foreman
couldn't afford to hire him.

25:39.289 --> 25:40.707
It was about the girl

25:40.790 --> 25:42.751
when he moved into a new apartment,

25:42.834 --> 25:45.670
a place Rebecca could be comfortable in.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.922
And it was about the girl

25:48.006 --> 25:50.091
every time he ate cup of noodles

25:50.175 --> 25:54.679
because he was scrimping
and saving just to buy the...

25:54.763 --> 25:56.931
ring stuck on my pinky finger right now.

25:59.267 --> 26:02.395
That is the kind of man
that your daughter is marrying.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.481
And if you can't find it within yourself

26:04.564 --> 26:06.066
to give him your blessing,

26:06.149 --> 26:07.984
well...
(scoffs)

26:08.068 --> 26:09.361
that says a whole lot more about you

26:09.444 --> 26:11.488
than it does about him.

26:19.120 --> 26:21.122
Do you have any dental floss?

26:23.500 --> 26:25.669
Janet's fingers turn into sausage

26:25.752 --> 26:27.712
when she has too much salt.

26:27.796 --> 26:29.673
So...

26:29.756 --> 26:31.966
I know a trick to get that ring off.

26:34.052 --> 26:36.554
Yeah, let me just go check
and see if sh...

26:36.638 --> 26:38.306
Hold that.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.058
(sniffs)

26:40.141 --> 26:42.143
-(exhales)
-(chuckles softly)

26:42.227 --> 26:43.603
Is-is it gonna hurt?

26:44.688 --> 26:45.855
Not much.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.733
Great.

26:50.694 --> 26:53.196
I've been thinking a lot
about my ghost kingdom.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.408
Oh, for the new people, "ghost kingdom" is

26:56.491 --> 26:59.327
a term that we use
for a hypothetical world

26:59.411 --> 27:03.415
where adoptees imagine
who their birth parents might be.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.667
I used to imagine Rita Moreno was my mom.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.836
-(others chuckling)
-She's so funny.

27:07.919 --> 27:09.504
I thought we must be related.

27:09.587 --> 27:13.258
Of course, when I actually met
my birth mother, she was

27:13.341 --> 27:14.592
nothing like Rita.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.344
We didn't have anything in common.

27:16.428 --> 27:17.637
Or maybe we did.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.305
It's hard to tell.

27:19.389 --> 27:22.392
I can't speak Spanish,
and she can't speak English.

27:23.476 --> 27:27.439
Lately, I've been letting myself
feel something

27:27.522 --> 27:31.317
I think I've known deep down
for my entire life.

27:32.777 --> 27:35.363
I wish I'd never been adopted.

27:35.447 --> 27:38.950
I made the mistake
of telling my adopted family

27:39.034 --> 27:40.618
how I've been feeling.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.495
I said, "I love you,

27:42.579 --> 27:45.707
"but I wish I never knew you.

27:45.790 --> 27:48.752
"Because if I could go back
in time and choose,

27:48.835 --> 27:52.881
I'd choose to stay
with my bipolar birth mom."

27:55.133 --> 27:58.011
Now half of them won't talk to me.

28:00.472 --> 28:02.932

28:18.198 --> 28:20.492
at the top of the song, it says "allegro."

28:20.575 --> 28:21.743
What does that mean?

28:21.826 --> 28:23.328
Uh, brisk and lively.

28:23.411 --> 28:26.039
Good.
Yeah, well...

28:26.122 --> 28:27.540
let's remember that

28:27.624 --> 28:28.625
and go again.

28:28.708 --> 28:29.626
Can I just say one thing?

28:29.709 --> 28:32.379
-Real quick.
-Sure.

28:32.462 --> 28:34.422
So, Eliza, the woman who's singing,

28:34.506 --> 28:36.841
she was basically told her entire life

28:36.925 --> 28:38.009
that she was worthless.

28:38.093 --> 28:39.803
And now she's finally realizing

28:39.886 --> 28:42.681
that she is smart and she is a badass.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.224
-(students chuckling)
-(Kate chuckles)

28:44.307 --> 28:46.768
I don't know if I'm allowed to say that.

28:46.851 --> 28:47.977
Sorry.
But, on top of all that,

28:48.061 --> 28:50.021
she just finished dancing

28:50.105 --> 28:52.899
with her cranky but charming
tutor for the first time,

28:52.982 --> 28:55.151
and-and it's making her just feel

28:55.235 --> 28:56.778
so excited she could burst.

28:56.861 --> 28:57.904
So it's safe to say

28:57.987 --> 28:59.614
that when you're singing the song,

28:59.698 --> 29:01.908
that you would feel all the things.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.911
Okay.
Got it.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.789
Okay.
W-Well, let's...

29:07.872 --> 29:09.791
-let's go again.

Tess said she saw a look on my face

29:53.918 --> 29:55.128
when I walked in on her and Alex,

29:55.211 --> 29:59.090
saw me reacting to them... being together.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.717
Mm.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.891
I don't know what's wrong with me.

30:07.974 --> 30:11.311
When Tess first came out,
I was totally fine.

30:11.394 --> 30:12.979
And now I-I...

30:13.063 --> 30:15.065
(sighs)

30:17.192 --> 30:19.319
I think I'm having trouble letting go.

30:19.402 --> 30:20.862
(stammers)

30:20.945 --> 30:23.198
What are you letting go of?

30:24.199 --> 30:26.201
She's my firstborn daughter.

30:27.410 --> 30:29.662
I had all these dreams
about what it was gonna be like

30:29.746 --> 30:31.539
when she got older, you know?
Like...

30:31.623 --> 30:32.999
she'd talk to me about the boys she liked

30:33.083 --> 30:35.669
or I'd help her get ready for dates.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.837
One day, I would watch her
walk down the aisle

30:37.921 --> 30:40.340
towards a man every bit as good
as her father.

30:42.801 --> 30:46.012
I thought I had let all that go, but I...

30:47.097 --> 30:50.558
Well, it's-it's more than letting go.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.936
You have to adjust.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.148
It's part of being a mother.

30:58.233 --> 31:01.569
This is the part where you let
go of what you thought would be

31:01.653 --> 31:04.614
and adjust to what is.

31:04.698 --> 31:06.241
When you left dance,

31:06.324 --> 31:09.703
I thought that you would go
into academics, like me.

31:09.786 --> 31:12.122
I thought you would choose to stay in D.C.

31:12.205 --> 31:13.790
and be close, always.

31:13.873 --> 31:17.377
See, that was my picture of your life.

31:18.378 --> 31:20.422
But the real picture--

31:20.505 --> 31:23.383
the woman you actually become,

31:23.466 --> 31:27.012
the things you actually want--

31:27.095 --> 31:28.930
they're just as beautiful.

31:34.644 --> 31:37.022
It took me some time to see that.

31:37.105 --> 31:38.940
(exhales)

31:39.024 --> 31:41.818
Too much time, if you ask me.

31:43.153 --> 31:46.156
So I hope that you
will adjust quicker, Bethany.

31:47.824 --> 31:50.994
Time is so precious.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.371
You blink

31:53.455 --> 31:56.374
and your daughter's grown

31:56.458 --> 31:58.168
and you're holed up in her house,

31:58.251 --> 32:01.463
trying to make up for 20 years

32:01.546 --> 32:04.049
of not adjusting.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.585
Okay.

32:40.669 --> 32:43.546
Twins are finally in bed
after a long day at the park.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.758
Had to sing "Rock-a-bye Baby"
to them about ten times.

32:46.841 --> 32:48.510
(both chuckle softly)

32:48.593 --> 32:51.012
It's some bleak, bleak lyrics,
but it works.

32:51.096 --> 32:53.556
Least it's not "Ring Around the Rosie."

32:53.640 --> 32:55.433
-Yeah.
-'Cause that song
is the stuff of nightmares.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.018
-(chuckles)
-Oh, that song is just brutal, isn't it?

32:59.062 --> 33:00.939
Kevin...

33:01.022 --> 33:03.650
-Yeah?
-I...

33:03.733 --> 33:06.569
I don't think I want
to get married at the Villas.

33:10.907 --> 33:12.909
You don't?

33:14.911 --> 33:17.580
So, my father was a pretty...

33:17.664 --> 33:20.375
withholding man.

33:20.458 --> 33:22.502
Emotionally, I mean.

33:22.585 --> 33:25.380
And, um, he wasn't around a lot
when I was little.

33:25.463 --> 33:28.174
-Traveled a lot.
-Mm.

33:28.258 --> 33:29.676
So, my mother...

33:29.759 --> 33:31.970
One day, she finally put her foot down.

33:32.053 --> 33:34.097
You know, told him to...

33:34.180 --> 33:36.933
"Take us with you
on one of your business trips.

33:37.017 --> 33:39.894
Make time for us, or else."

33:39.978 --> 33:42.981
He took us to Japan.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.109
Which explains the Kabuki mask collection.

33:46.192 --> 33:49.696
-Yeah.
-We spent a perfect day

33:49.779 --> 33:52.699
walking around the most beautiful garden

33:52.782 --> 33:55.160
I have ever seen.

33:55.243 --> 33:59.080
My mom laughed a lot.

33:59.164 --> 34:03.126
I remember my dad held both our hands,

34:03.209 --> 34:06.338
actually asked me questions about school.

34:06.421 --> 34:10.133
We had a picnic under the cherry trees.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.218
(both chuckle)

34:12.302 --> 34:15.180
For one day...

34:15.263 --> 34:17.891
we were a family.

34:19.267 --> 34:22.937
A few weeks later, they told me
they were getting divorced.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.774
I guess you would think

34:25.857 --> 34:28.276
that would have soured the trip
in my mind, but...

34:28.360 --> 34:31.404
I have spent a lifetime

34:31.488 --> 34:35.033
chasing the happiness
I felt in that garden.

34:38.912 --> 34:41.623
So, there's this garden

34:41.706 --> 34:43.750
that I really love.

34:43.833 --> 34:46.503
It's not as fancy as the Villas,

34:46.586 --> 34:49.255
but it's outside,
and it's-it's COVID-safe,

34:49.339 --> 34:53.843
and it has a lot of the same trees

34:53.927 --> 34:55.261
-and flowers.
-Yes.

34:56.930 --> 34:59.140
Yeah, let's get married there.

34:59.224 --> 35:00.433
Just like that?

35:01.518 --> 35:02.769
Just like that.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.814
I mean, it sounds perfect.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.983
(knock on door)

35:09.067 --> 35:11.069
Come in.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.699
Hey.

35:17.117 --> 35:18.702
Hey.

35:21.996 --> 35:23.540
Tess.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.463
You will not call me names.

35:30.547 --> 35:32.716
Not in front of anyone.

35:32.799 --> 35:34.384
Not in private.

35:34.467 --> 35:37.846
That is not the way we do things
in this house.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.724
Understood?

35:42.767 --> 35:44.227
Understood.

35:46.855 --> 35:49.190
But...

35:49.274 --> 35:52.527
you should be able to tell me
how I make you feel.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.866
If you saw anything on my face today

35:57.949 --> 36:00.285
when I saw you and Alex
together on your bed,

36:00.368 --> 36:02.454
you need to know this.

36:02.537 --> 36:06.207
It has nothing to do
with how much I love you.

36:07.292 --> 36:10.128
Actually, it has nothing to do
with you at all.

36:11.171 --> 36:13.715
Because you're perfect.

36:15.133 --> 36:17.135
Just the way you are.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.805
And Alex seems pretty perfect

36:20.889 --> 36:23.099
just the way they are.
(chuckles)

36:31.232 --> 36:33.193
Is there anything else
you want to say to me?

36:39.574 --> 36:41.534
I know you're trying.

36:42.994 --> 36:45.997
I also know you don't have
to try with Annie.

36:46.081 --> 36:47.916
Or Deja.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.127
And it makes me sad.

36:51.211 --> 36:53.672
Makes me wonder
if we'll ever be close again.

36:54.756 --> 36:57.217
Oh, Tess, of course we will.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.761
We <i>are</i> close now.

36:59.844 --> 37:03.515
We are, and we always will be.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.893
Okay, Mom.

37:16.903 --> 37:19.531
And then my speech
helped Amelia soar.

37:19.614 --> 37:20.740
I mean, Philip wouldn't admit it,

37:20.824 --> 37:22.575
but we both know that she really soared.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.536
Bam!
Hell yeah, she did.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.330
Nobody summarizes <i>My Fair Lady</i>

37:27.414 --> 37:28.873
-like you, babe.
-Thank you.

37:30.834 --> 37:33.712
You okay?
I'm sorry, I know I've been talking

37:33.795 --> 37:36.297
-a mile a minute since I got home.
-Uh, yeah.

37:36.381 --> 37:39.634
No, I'm fine.
I'm just really, really tired.

37:41.428 --> 37:44.305
I do have some good photos from today.
You want to see?

37:44.389 --> 37:47.267
What?
Holding out on me?

37:47.350 --> 37:49.894
(gasps)
Babe.

37:49.978 --> 37:53.064
Look at him on a swing!
Aw.

37:54.691 --> 37:56.693
(sighs)

37:58.945 --> 38:00.822
(phone vibrating)

38:00.905 --> 38:02.657
Hello?

38:02.741 --> 38:05.160
Oh, hey. Uh, hey, Miguel.
It's Nicky.

38:06.244 --> 38:09.414
Oh.
Uh... hey.

38:09.497 --> 38:11.916
Uh...

38:12.000 --> 38:15.462
I j... I just want to apologize
for the way I acted before.

38:15.545 --> 38:18.840
<i>Th-That was...</i>
<i>That was my own stuff.</i>

38:18.923 --> 38:20.300

38:20.383 --> 38:22.719
Okay.
Um...

38:22.802 --> 38:24.846
Well, thank you.

38:24.929 --> 38:26.890
Okay.
Well, anyway, that's it.

38:26.973 --> 38:28.475
Um...

38:28.558 --> 38:30.060
Sorry to bother you.

38:30.143 --> 38:34.773
<i>-Good night.</i>
-He never replaced you, Nicky.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.566

<i>All right.</i>

38:36.649 --> 38:38.943
Well, my work is done here.

38:39.027 --> 38:41.029
It's all on you now, my friend.

38:43.990 --> 38:47.786
Hey, things go well tonight,

38:47.869 --> 38:49.162
you know, like, she says yes

38:49.245 --> 38:51.081
-and everything...
-(scoffs) She's gonna...

38:51.164 --> 38:54.751
...would you stand at the altar with me?

38:54.834 --> 38:58.296
You know, maybe say a few words
at the reception?

39:00.006 --> 39:01.966
<i>MIGUEL:</i>
<i>We both knew what he meant,</i>

39:02.050 --> 39:03.635
but he just, uh...
(chuckles)

39:03.718 --> 39:05.095
He couldn't say the words.

39:05.178 --> 39:08.848
He, he couldn't call me his best man

39:08.932 --> 39:12.560
<i>because I think that somewhere deep down,</i>

39:12.644 --> 39:15.438
he was saving that place for you.

39:19.067 --> 39:20.610
<i>You know,</i>

39:20.694 --> 39:22.821
if you wanted to,

39:22.904 --> 39:25.490
we could do the rehearsal dinner
toast together.

39:25.573 --> 39:28.660
Oh, no, I-I don't want to give a toast.
I just...

39:28.743 --> 39:31.705
I just didn't like the idea
that you were gonna do it.
