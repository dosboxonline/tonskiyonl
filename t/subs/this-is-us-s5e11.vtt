-(Pumpkin whimpers)
-Sally. Hi.

10:41.725 --> 10:44.019
Yeah, Pumpkin needs a bath,

10:44.102 --> 10:46.855
but I don't think we can lift her,
even if we both tried.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.356
Oh.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.608
-She's very stubborn.
-Yeah.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.820
She's a willful lady, all right.

10:53.903 --> 10:56.698
You can't force a willful lady
to do anything.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.366
There's only one thing to do.

11:00.368 --> 11:01.619
Hmm?

11:09.085 --> 11:11.546
-Okay. -(Pumpkin chuffs)
-(clears throat)

11:11.629 --> 11:13.465
Oh, this water feels so warm.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.050
It's so warm and refreshing.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.760
This feels great.

11:16.843 --> 11:19.012
Come on, Pumpkin!
Come on.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
Oh, good girl.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.390
Come on.
Oh, yeah, good girl.

11:22.474 --> 11:26.102
Yes. Come here, baby.
Come on.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.104
-Good girl.
-You're so good.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.565
Cover up your eyes,
'cause I'm gonna put it on your head.

11:30.648 --> 11:33.818
Good girl. You're so good!
(laughs)

11:33.902 --> 11:37.489
There is slobber all over.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.574
-(Sally laughs)
-Ah.

11:40.575 --> 11:42.952
(clears throat)

11:43.036 --> 11:45.163
Water's so healing, no?

11:45.246 --> 11:48.375
Yeah, yeah, totally.
So healing.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.919
(gasps) Did you see the men
on the Moon last night?

11:51.002 --> 11:54.297
I thought it was poetic,
and it was sort of surreal.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.383
Yeah, it was.

11:56.466 --> 11:58.343
And if you thought that was exciting,

11:58.426 --> 12:01.971
in two days, the module's gonna
come zooming back to Earth

12:02.055 --> 12:04.265
with the astronauts in it
going 25,000 miles per hour,

12:04.349 --> 12:06.601
and everybody's hoping
that it doesn't, um,

12:06.685 --> 12:08.728
disintegrate or bounce back into space.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.773
-Whoa. That's so intense.
-Yeah.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.233
(clears throat)

12:13.316 --> 12:16.069
I'm driving up to Mount Washington tonight

12:16.152 --> 12:18.988
to go look at the Moon.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.116
Do you ever do that kind of a thing?

12:21.199 --> 12:23.618
Um...

12:23.702 --> 12:25.870
I'm a Cancer, so, uh,

12:25.954 --> 12:28.665
I've always felt very close to the Moon.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.252
Far out.
(laughs)

12:32.335 --> 12:33.795
Uh...

12:34.838 --> 12:37.215
Yeah, uh...

12:37.298 --> 12:40.844
Well, I... You should have
a great night, but I-I...

12:40.927 --> 12:43.555
My brother's probably waiting
for me, so...

12:43.638 --> 12:45.015
-Okay.
-Bye.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.434
Bye.
(clears throat)

12:49.853 --> 12:51.771
-Hey.
-Hey. Hi.

12:51.855 --> 12:53.857
Hi.
Uh, Sally, I'm Jack.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.692
I'm Nicky's brother.

12:55.775 --> 13:00.238
Jack. You have a very proud,
determined energy. Cancer?

13:00.321 --> 13:03.616
Uh... no.
I'm... fine.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.952
Uh, listen, I didn't mean
to eavesdrop, but

13:06.036 --> 13:07.454
I overheard you say
that you're gonna be, um,

13:07.537 --> 13:09.581
-checking out the Moon tonight.
-Jack?

13:09.664 --> 13:11.875
Um, there is no better person
to do that with

13:11.958 --> 13:14.669
than my brother Nick.
I mean, this guy-- he knows...

13:14.753 --> 13:18.048
Jack... I'm perfectly capable
of asking your brother out

13:18.131 --> 13:20.675
-all on my own.
-Yeah.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.011
-SALLY: Nicky...
-Uh...

13:23.094 --> 13:24.637
...how would you like to come meet Pearl

13:24.721 --> 13:26.306
and gaze at the Moon with us tonight?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.893
Yeah.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.770
Yeah, I... I would love that.

13:31.853 --> 13:33.396
Groovy.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.234
Here's my address.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.238
Okay, um...

13:44.157 --> 13:45.742
Oh.
Yeah, bye.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.786
-JACK: Thank you.
-I'll see ya.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.873
-Who's Pearl?
-Who cares?

13:53.917 --> 13:56.503
Just remember, you got to take
your shoes off at security now.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.463
Oh.
What an idiotic country.

13:58.546 --> 13:59.923
You sure you don't want to call Kevin?

14:00.006 --> 14:01.299
He's got two newborns.

14:01.383 --> 14:03.635
I mean, a heads-up might be nice.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.345
-Yeah.
-Someone should know

14:05.428 --> 14:06.971
-you're traveling across the country.
-You know.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.057
Someone in your family should know.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.767

14:16.815 --> 14:18.400
You know, in case I don't make it,

14:18.483 --> 14:20.610
I don't want to disappoint him.
Can't do that to him.

14:21.903 --> 14:24.406
-Just remember to breathe, okay?

you don't have headphones.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.437

used to talk on planes?

21:56.858 --> 21:58.985

21:59.069 --> 22:01.363

22:01.446 --> 22:03.865
Uh, no, uh...

22:03.948 --> 22:05.658

22:06.868 --> 22:07.994
Wow.

22:12.582 --> 22:15.627
I just can't believe
the Moon's a destination now.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.212
(Sally chuckles)

22:17.295 --> 22:20.840
Like Chicago or Toledo.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.885
-Huh.
-Okay, I have something mind-blowing

22:23.968 --> 22:26.346
to show you,
but you have to close your eyes.

22:26.429 --> 22:27.931
-Close my eyes?
-Close.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.849
-Okay.
-(paper rustling)

22:30.892 --> 22:32.477

22:36.564 --> 22:39.484

-Three days of peace,

22:39.567 --> 22:41.069
-love and music.
-Whoa.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.363
Jimi Hendrix
and Richie Havens are playing?

22:43.446 --> 22:46.199
I want to hear Janis sing the blues.

22:46.282 --> 22:48.284
I want to <i>see</i> Janis sing the blues.

22:48.368 --> 22:49.703

22:49.786 --> 22:51.663

22:51.746 --> 22:53.707
So, you'll come?

22:54.958 --> 22:56.292
Yeah.

22:56.376 --> 22:57.794
Yeah, I'll come.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.504
And then...

22:59.587 --> 23:01.840
after Woodstock...

23:01.923 --> 23:03.591
I think that you and I

23:03.675 --> 23:06.970
should just pack up Pearl
and hit the road.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.222
I think we should
just leave Pittsburgh behind

23:09.305 --> 23:10.765
and go to California.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.728
My cousin has this farm there
outside of San Francisco,

23:14.811 --> 23:17.856
and, well, he said that we could come,
and we could help out

23:17.939 --> 23:19.190
with the animals, and...

23:19.274 --> 23:21.359
And anytime we get bored, we could just

23:21.443 --> 23:24.112
pack up Pearl and hit the road.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.781
So, y-you want to drive to California

23:26.865 --> 23:29.200
and move there for-for good.

23:29.284 --> 23:32.620
"For good."
What does that mean, "for good"? (scoffs)

23:32.704 --> 23:36.207
My Grandma Pearl used to say,

23:36.291 --> 23:39.377
"Sweetie, you can do anything
you want with your life,

23:39.461 --> 23:41.463
or you can do nothing."

23:46.259 --> 23:47.719
(grunts softly)

23:47.802 --> 23:49.637
Yeah? Okay,

23:49.721 --> 23:50.764
so, we have to leave Wednesday night,

23:50.847 --> 23:52.098
because the festival starts on Friday,

23:52.182 --> 23:54.392
and we want to get a good spot.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.269
Okay.

23:56.353 --> 23:58.229
Okay,
I'll meet you here at 11:00

You know, you were his favorite.

Can't picture you on a bike.

-Yeah.

34:18.475 --> 34:20.185
you worked at a vet clinic before the war?

34:20.268 --> 34:22.812
-Yeah, I did.
-Yeah. Yeah.

34:22.896 --> 34:25.690
Oh. And-and we got to figure out
what it is

34:25.774 --> 34:27.400
that you want them to call you.

34:27.484 --> 34:29.444
Uh, uh, it's not "Grandpa," obviously,

34:29.527 --> 34:31.237
but, uh, it could be...

34:31.321 --> 34:34.407
it could be "Chief," it could be "Toot"

34:34.491 --> 34:35.784
or-or, um...

34:35.867 --> 34:37.827
it could-- "Pops."

34:41.748 --> 34:43.458
You-you must be exhausted.

34:43.541 --> 34:45.168
You're probably dead tired
from the traveling, I would imagine.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.712
You want me to go make up your bed,
get that ready for you?

34:47.796 --> 34:50.131
-Good idea.
-How about... Yeah, I'll do that for you.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.134
(exhales)

34:58.181 --> 35:00.892
(taking deep breaths)

35:18.076 --> 35:19.411
(line ringing)

35:19.494 --> 35:21.496
(buzzing)

35:23.081 --> 35:25.000
It's 4:00 a.m. here, old man.

35:25.083 --> 35:27.335
Ah, you suck at sleeping just like I do.

35:27.419 --> 35:30.338
<i>-Oh, I knew you'd be up.</i>
-It's true.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.798
What's going on?

35:31.881 --> 35:34.092
(sighs)

35:34.175 --> 35:38.263
I'm thinking that
this whole thing was a mistake.

35:38.346 --> 35:40.056
<i>You know, I thought that the plane ride</i>

35:40.140 --> 35:41.433
<i>would be the hard part,</i>

35:41.516 --> 35:44.019
but now I'm thinking
I might just sneak out of here

35:44.102 --> 35:45.979
while everybody's asleep, and I'll just,

35:46.062 --> 35:47.772
you know, I'll call Kevin

35:47.856 --> 35:50.608
<i>-once I land...</i>
-Are you certifiably insane?

35:50.692 --> 35:52.610
It's just different now that I'm here.

35:52.694 --> 35:55.238
I mean, Jack's kid named his kid after me.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.533
I mean... (exhales)
God, Jack must be rolling in his grave

35:58.616 --> 36:00.201
around that one.

36:00.285 --> 36:02.912
Now the kid wants me to go to the park

36:02.996 --> 36:05.790
and take pictures and be "Grandpa."

36:05.874 --> 36:09.085
<i>-Ugh, it's too much.</i>
-Nicky...

36:09.169 --> 36:11.338
(takes deep breath)

36:11.421 --> 36:13.882
You've hated yourself for so long,

36:13.965 --> 36:16.009
and now you have all this love
coming at you,

36:16.092 --> 36:18.595
and it feels weird,
and you want to go AWOL.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.597
<i>And then what,</i>
<i>go back to your trailer alone</i>

36:20.680 --> 36:23.808
<i>and stare at the same</i>
<i>plot of land until you die?</i>

36:23.892 --> 36:25.477
I...

36:25.560 --> 36:29.439
I didn't know this brother of yours,

36:29.522 --> 36:32.400
<i>but I do know two pretty decent men</i>

36:32.484 --> 36:34.778
<i>who have spent their lives</i>

36:34.861 --> 36:37.572
<i>wondering if he would be proud of them.</i>

36:38.782 --> 36:41.493
Deep down...

36:41.576 --> 36:44.788
don't you think
he'd be proud of you, Nicky?

36:44.871 --> 36:46.581
<i>Took a while, but you made it.</i>

36:46.664 --> 36:49.084
<i>You made it all the way to California.</i>

36:58.134 --> 36:59.678
Hey there, babies.

37:01.012 --> 37:04.015
Don't worry, I won't get too close.

37:05.225 --> 37:08.728
FYI, I've been vaccinated, twice.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.899
Um, I-I...

37:12.982 --> 37:16.778
I made these really special gifts for you,

37:16.861 --> 37:19.823
but, um, this country is kind of idiotic

37:19.906 --> 37:22.117
about its rules sometimes, so I got you...

37:22.200 --> 37:24.244
I got you these instead.

37:25.328 --> 37:28.248
Well, my favorite John Grisham novels.

37:28.331 --> 37:30.417
That's <i>The Firm.</i>

37:30.500 --> 37:32.669
And, uh...

37:32.752 --> 37:35.171
and <i>The Rainmaker.</i>

37:35.255 --> 37:37.424
Uh, I'm sorry they're in paperback.

37:37.507 --> 37:40.385
It's the only thing they had
at the airport gift shop.

37:41.553 --> 37:42.512
(fussing quietly)

37:42.595 --> 37:45.598
I-I jotted some things down in...

37:45.682 --> 37:46.766
in the book.

37:46.850 --> 37:49.853
Uh, no great words of wisdom.

37:51.062 --> 37:52.105
But...

37:52.188 --> 37:54.107
when you're an old man

37:54.190 --> 37:57.819
and you're looking out a plane window...

37:57.902 --> 37:59.362
(takes deep breath)

37:59.446 --> 38:01.573
...you think about all the

38:01.656 --> 38:04.367
mistakes you make in life.

38:24.220 --> 38:25.638
<i>I lived alone.</i>

38:25.722 --> 38:29.684
Every day, the same routine for 50 years.

38:32.020 --> 38:34.564
But then...

38:34.647 --> 38:38.193
I got an invitation to meet you two.

38:38.276 --> 38:39.944
And you know,

38:40.028 --> 38:42.197
you know what it got me thinking about?

38:44.366 --> 38:47.744
It got me thinking about the Moon.

38:47.827 --> 38:52.707
July 20, 1969...

38:54.876 --> 38:57.962
...I watched a man walk on the Moon.

38:58.046 --> 39:02.217
One day, we'd never been to the Moon.

39:02.300 --> 39:06.721
It was impossible to even fathom
walking on it.

39:06.805 --> 39:09.265
And the next day,

39:09.349 --> 39:11.351
we're walking on it.

39:13.353 --> 39:17.023
The impossible became possible,

39:17.107 --> 39:19.150
just like that.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.571
(baby coos)

39:25.073 --> 39:27.617
For 50 years,

39:27.701 --> 39:30.161
I lived in a trailer.

39:30.245 --> 39:33.581
A trailer that went nowhere.

39:33.665 --> 39:36.668
Whatever the opposite is of an astronaut,

39:36.751 --> 39:39.170
that-that's...
(scoffs)

39:39.254 --> 39:42.132
That's what I became.

39:44.759 --> 39:47.721
And then I got that invitation

39:47.804 --> 39:51.016
in the mail...

39:51.099 --> 39:53.643
for a Zoom...
(laughs)

39:53.727 --> 39:55.770
...apparently, whatever the hell that is.

39:57.689 --> 40:00.275
But an invitation to meet

40:00.358 --> 40:03.319
my great-nephew

40:03.403 --> 40:05.155
and my great-niece.

40:05.238 --> 40:07.282
(cooing)

40:11.995 --> 40:14.789
My big brother's grandchildren.

40:21.463 --> 40:26.051
I've lived alone a really long time,

40:26.134 --> 40:28.470
and I've been...

40:28.553 --> 40:30.889
I've been stuck.

40:33.516 --> 40:36.353
And...

40:36.436 --> 40:38.897
anything...

40:38.980 --> 40:42.734
anything good
that would ever happen to me,

40:42.817 --> 40:46.905
it just seemed...

40:46.988 --> 40:49.074
it just seemed impossible.

40:52.285 --> 40:54.954
But here I am.
I made it.

40:57.540 --> 41:00.210
You two--

41:00.293 --> 41:02.629
You two were my Moon.

41:03.672 --> 41:06.049
(coos, grunts)

41:08.218 --> 41:11.429
Okay, that's it.
(exhales)

41:14.557 --> 41:16.267
You just call me "Uncle Nicky," okay?

41:16.351 --> 41:18.269
No stupid nicknames.

41:21.648 --> 41:23.608
-Okay?
-(cooing)

41:25.860 --> 41:27.862
