11:25.069 --> 11:26.988

I was wondering when the El Capitan
was gonna get a chance to use his popgun.

There'd be eight others left.

could have done a lot of damage

44:13.285 --> 44:16.539
Doc says we gotta lock him up.
Stash him in here and lock him up.

44:17.206 --> 44:19.358
- I have to talk to you.
- I'm tired of talking, Fuchs.

44:19.458 --> 44:21.235
I just wanna get up to my shack
and get drunk.

44:21.335 --> 44:23.796
- Mac, it's important.
- What is it?

44:25.548 --> 44:27.700
- Outside.
- It's 40 below outside.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.969
In the Thiokol. Please, Mac.

44:45.526 --> 44:49.989
- We ought to just burn these things.
- Can't burn the find of the century.

44:50.781 --> 44:53.033
That's gonna win somebody the Nobel Prize.

45:06.380 --> 45:08.032
You got the keys?

45:08.132 --> 45:11.552
Get them from Garry.
I wanna get some stuff out of here.

45:45.753 --> 45:47.446
There's something wrong with Blair.

45:47.546 --> 45:50.783
He's locked himself in his room,
and he won't answer the door.

45:50.883 --> 45:52.868
So I took one of his notebooks from the lab.

45:52.968 --> 45:54.720
- Yeah?
- Listen.

45:56.597 --> 45:59.667
"It could have imitated
a million life-forms on a million planets.

45:59.767 --> 46:02.044

"Now it wants life-forms on Earth."

It's getting cold in here,

- Damn it, MacReady.

47:02.788 --> 47:05.249
I'll get Garry. We'll meet in Blair's room.

47:11.714 --> 47:13.257
It's Bennings!

47:23.434 --> 47:26.729

48:28.374 --> 48:31.819
If it had more time it would have looked,
sounded and acted like Bennings.

48:31.919 --> 48:33.779
I don't know what you're saying.

48:33.879 --> 48:37.341
That was one of those things out there
trying to imitate him, Garry.

48:41.720 --> 48:43.622
- Come on.
- MacReady, I know Bennings.

48:43.722 --> 48:46.684
I've known him for 10 years. He's my friend.

48:48.477 --> 48:50.688

There is nothing left.

50:42.049 --> 50:43.801
I can't find Blair.

- Jesus.
- Just leave it here. We're gonna talk.

pretty good.

Why don't you just trust in the Lord?

55:45.018 --> 55:47.979
- Watch Clark.
- What?

55:49.481 --> 55:52.317
I said, watch Clark.

55:53.151 --> 55:55.654
And watch him close. Do you hear me?

56:52.878 --> 56:54.296

We could take a sample of each person's
blood, mix it with uncontaminated blood.

I suppose if there's a reaction,
we'd know who isn't human.

- We've got whole blood in storage.
- Start working on it.

57:07.058 --> 57:08.852

- Yeah.

- The lock is undamaged.

then locked it.

I don't know about Copper,

01:00:10.033 --> 01:00:13.411
but I give you my word,
I did not go near that blood.

01:00:21.002 --> 01:00:24.005
But I guess you'll all feel a little easier

01:00:26.049 --> 01:00:28.343
if somebody else was in charge.

01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:32.722

- Like hell you will.

a little more even-tempered, Childs.

And if you were all these things,
then you'd just attack me right now.

01:01:29.779 --> 01:01:32.073
So some of you are still human.

01:01:33.032 --> 01:01:37.704
This thing doesn't want to show itself.
It wants to hide inside an imitation.

01:01:39.038 --> 01:01:41.024
It'll fight if it has to.

01:01:41.124 --> 01:01:43.668
But it's vulnerable out in the open.

01:01:44.878 --> 01:01:46.671
If it takes us over,

01:01:48.339 --> 01:01:50.467
then it has no more enemies,

move over there away from the others.

shoot them up with morphine.

- You don't wanna drug me.

Mac, I'm not a prisoner!

01:02:54.739 --> 01:02:56.975
Let me do it.
You're gonna break the needle in my arm.

No, Doc, he's doing a real fine job.

01:03:08.962 --> 01:03:11.798

at least there'll be some kind of record.

Nobody trusts anybody now.

01:04:13.651 --> 01:04:15.904
There's nothing else I can do.

01:04:16.571 --> 01:04:17.906

U.S. Outpost, number 31.

01:04:40.053 --> 01:04:42.305
You come up with anything yet?

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.349
One or two ideas.

01:04:48.353 --> 01:04:50.547
But, MacReady, I've been thinking.

01:04:50.647 --> 01:04:54.592
If a small particle of this thing
is enough to take over an entire organism,

01:04:54.692 --> 01:04:56.761
then everyone should prepare their own meals.

01:04:56.861 --> 01:04:59.447

01:06:14.772 --> 01:06:16.441
Anybody see Fuchs?

01:06:19.402 --> 01:06:21.429
Somebody blew out a fuse in the lab.

01:06:21.529 --> 01:06:24.933
Lights were out for an hour.
Anyone of us could've gotten to him.

01:06:25.033 --> 01:06:26.893
All right, we gotta find him.

01:06:26.993 --> 01:06:30.063
Nauls, why don't you come with me
and we'll look outside.

01:06:30.163 --> 01:06:32.690
Palmer, you and Windows check the inside.

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:34.917
I ain't going with Windows.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:38.947
I ain't going with him. I'll go with Childs.

01:06:39.047 --> 01:06:41.532
- Hey, fuck you, Palmer!
- I ain't going with you!

01:06:41.632 --> 01:06:44.969
- Who says I want you going with me?
- Cut the bullshit!

01:06:47.805 --> 01:06:50.500
Windows, you come with us.
Norris, you stay here.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.878
Any of them move, you fry them.
You hear anything, cut loose on the sirens.

01:06:53.978 --> 01:06:57.065

Blair, have you seen Fuchs?

01:07:33.851 --> 01:07:37.688
I don't wanna stay out here anymore.
I wanna come back inside.

01:07:41.234 --> 01:07:43.444
I hear funny things out here.

- It ain't Fuchs.

It ain't Fuchs.

01:07:53.246 --> 01:07:56.107
I'm not gonna harm anybody.
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:07:56.207 --> 01:07:59.444
And if there was, I'm all better now.
I'd like to come back inside.

I wanna come back inside,
don't you understand?

01:08:14.267 --> 01:08:18.629
I'm all right.
I'm much better... and I won't harm anybody.

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:21.399

01:08:53.514 --> 01:08:54.599
Yeah.

01:08:55.892 --> 01:08:57.768
Why would it burn him?

01:08:58.435 --> 01:09:01.147
Flare. Maybe he tried to burn it.

01:09:05.276 --> 01:09:08.654
Maybe he burned himself
before it could get to him.

01:09:15.286 --> 01:09:18.497
Great! Now what are we gonna do?

01:09:20.082 --> 01:09:22.777
You go inside.
Tell the others we found Fuchs.

01:09:22.877 --> 01:09:25.029
We'll be in as soon as we can.

01:09:25.129 --> 01:09:27.490
- Where are we going?
- Up to my shack.

01:09:28.966 --> 01:09:32.428
'Cause when I left yesterday,
I turned the lights off.

How long have they been out there?

01:09:57.620 --> 01:09:59.455
Forty, 45 minutes.

I cut him loose of the line up by his shack.

01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:11.093
- Cut him loose?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.193 --> 01:11:14.572
We were up checking around his place,
I found this.

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:20.244
Look. It was stashed in his oil furnace.

01:11:20.494 --> 01:11:23.940
Wind must've dislodged it,
but I don't think he saw me find it.

01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:27.818
I made sure I got ahead of him
on the towline on the way back.

01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:29.462
I cut him loose.

into one of those things?

He's had time.

Nothing human could've made it back
here in this weather without a guide line.

01:12:07.291 --> 01:12:09.402
- Let's open it now.
- Why are you so anxious to let him in here?

01:12:09.502 --> 01:12:10.528

maybe every part of him was a whole.

won't obey when it's attacked.

(WIND HOWLING)

01:27:19.577 --> 01:27:21.621
Mac, the door's open!

01:27:36.386 --> 01:27:39.889
How'd he get out?
The door was bolted from the outside.

01:27:46.688 --> 01:27:47.689
(WOOD CREAKS)

01:28:24.768 --> 01:28:25.935
GARRY: Blair?

01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:33.818
NAULS: Hey, Blair, you down there?
We got something for ya!

01:28:44.871 --> 01:28:47.665
MacREADY: Blair's been busy out here
all by himself.

01:28:57.717 --> 01:28:58.968
What is it?

01:28:59.636 --> 01:29:01.246
Something he's been making.

01:29:01.346 --> 01:29:03.348
It's a ship of some kind.

01:29:04.933 --> 01:29:06.793
He stole the parts from the helicopter.

01:29:06.893 --> 01:29:09.813
The smart S.O.B. put it together
piece by piece.

01:29:11.564 --> 01:29:13.608
Where was he trying to go?

01:29:14.776 --> 01:29:16.444
Anyplace but here.

01:29:56.359 --> 01:29:58.695
Hey, you guys, come here. Come here.

01:30:05.410 --> 01:30:09.247
I think I saw Childs outside
the main entrance of the camp.

01:30:09.372 --> 01:30:12.041
- What's he doing outside?
- I don't know.

01:30:23.219 --> 01:30:24.596
Got a flare?

01:30:27.432 --> 01:30:30.226
He got back inside and blew the generator.

01:30:32.395 --> 01:30:35.256
In six hours,
it'll be a hundred below in here.

01:30:35.356 --> 01:30:37.150
Well, that's suicide!

01:30:38.067 --> 01:30:41.779
Not for that thing. It wants to freeze now.

01:30:42.989 --> 01:30:44.057
It's got no way out of here.

01:30:44.157 --> 01:30:47.619
It just wants to go to sleep in the cold
until the rescue team finds it.

01:30:49.329 --> 01:30:51.748
What can we do? What can we do?

01:30:53.374 --> 01:30:56.920
Whether we make it or not,
we can't let that thing freeze again.

01:30:58.254 --> 01:31:01.591
Maybe we'll just warm things up
a little around here.

01:31:06.638 --> 01:31:09.140
We're not getting out of here alive.

01:31:11.184 --> 01:31:12.936
But neither is that thing.

01:32:20.086 --> 01:32:21.337
(GLASS SHATTERING)

01:33:02.545 --> 01:33:04.213
Generator room.

01:34:11.989 --> 01:34:13.850
The generator's gone.

01:34:13.950 --> 01:34:15.785
Any way we can fix it?

01:34:18.079 --> 01:34:20.123
It's gone, MacReady.

01:34:28.548 --> 01:34:29.882
All right.

01:34:30.675 --> 01:34:34.220
We gotta bring this whole place
right down into the ice.

01:34:34.554 --> 01:34:37.390
Garry, plant yours in the old storage room.

01:34:37.974 --> 01:34:40.184
Nauls, down by the generator.

01:35:32.069 --> 01:35:33.321
God!

01:35:40.661 --> 01:35:41.662
(MOANING)

01:36:43.182 --> 01:36:45.184
How's it coming in there?

01:36:46.853 --> 01:36:48.521
I said, how's it...

01:38:04.889 --> 01:38:05.890
(GROWLING)

01:38:33.918 --> 01:38:35.920
Yeah, fuck you, too!

01:40:01.297 --> 01:40:03.382
You the only one who made it?

01:40:04.216 --> 01:40:05.843
Not the only one.

01:40:08.387 --> 01:40:09.972
Did you kill it?

01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:13.017
Where were you, Childs?

01:40:14.518 --> 01:40:16.312
Thought I saw Blair.

01:40:17.646 --> 01:40:21.776
I went out after him
and got lost in the storm.

01:40:32.244 --> 01:40:35.331
Fire's got the temperature up
all over the camp.

01:40:37.583 --> 01:40:39.585
Won't last long, though.

01:40:40.377 --> 01:40:42.004
Neither will we.

01:40:44.173 --> 01:40:45.925
How will we make it?

01:40:48.135 --> 01:40:49.845
Maybe we shouldn't.

01:40:55.017 --> 01:40:56.585
If you're worried about me...

01:40:56.685 --> 01:40:59.522
If we've got any surprises for each other,

01:41:01.273 --> 01:41:04.902
I don't think we're in much shape
to do anything about it.

01:41:08.739 --> 01:41:12.827
Well... what do we do?

01:41:14.036 --> 01:41:15.830
Why don't we just...

01:41:17.540 --> 01:41:19.708
wait here for a little while?

01:41:22.378 --> 01:41:24.204
See what happens.
