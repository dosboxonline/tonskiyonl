of making this speech,
to be honest with you.

11:04.881 --> 11:07.623
- What do you mean?
- Oh, you know,

11:07.623 --> 11:08.929
"Watch your back,"
"We're on high alert,"

11:08.929 --> 11:10.626
and all this other bullshit.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.541
It's like my temper...

11:12.541 --> 11:14.369
my temper gets me in trouble.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.718
I bring a bazooka

11:15.718 --> 11:17.720
when a fucking peashooter
would do.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.156
A peashooter
wouldn't have stopped

11:19.156 --> 11:21.419
- that motherfucker last night.
- Nah.

11:21.419 --> 11:24.161
I'm talking about before,
with Bevilaqua?

11:24.161 --> 11:26.903
You know, I could've cut a deal
that I could live with

11:26.903 --> 11:28.992
instead of telling him
to go fuck himself.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.777
Look, I don't know you
all that well, but I know

11:30.777 --> 11:32.604
you ain't a guy
to do anything halfway.

11:32.604 --> 11:34.606
Hmm.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.219
If you want,
I could talk to everybody.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.351
I don't know.

11:40.351 --> 11:43.267
Let me think about it, you know.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.751
Hey, you know
what "Bevilaqua" means,

11:48.751 --> 11:51.101
whatever his fucked-up name is?
"Hot water."

11:51.101 --> 11:53.408
- [laughs]
- Fucking guy is in hot water.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.279
- Hot water?
- Mr. Jacuzzi.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.064
[laughs]

11:57.064 --> 11:59.414
- Jacuzzi man.
- Jacuzzi man.

12:15.996 --> 12:18.346
and please leave

though, you can get some

12:25.440 --> 12:27.485

Here you go, take off. Hey.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.186
What are you doing here?
How you doing, pooch?

12:32.186 --> 12:33.665
I thought you were on the wagon.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.059
I stopped drinking.
Weed calms me down.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.669
That's good.

12:37.669 --> 12:42.239
Fred, lock the door and put up

Food poisoning.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.683
Uh, excuse me, why did we
kick out our customers?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.598
What's going on?
What is happening?

12:53.598 --> 12:55.122
[Dwight mutters]

12:55.122 --> 12:57.124
We might have some trouble
coming our way.

12:57.124 --> 12:59.126
Oh.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.041
- What is it this time?
- Last night

13:01.041 --> 13:03.130
someone tried to take me out.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.827
We handled it.

13:04.827 --> 13:07.482
But these guys are
serious players.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.180
- And they can keep coming--
- Okay, no.

13:11.225 --> 13:12.922
I'm done. Fuck this.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.490
Wait, wait, wait, I-I got this.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.883
I got this.

13:18.449 --> 13:20.060
[sighs]

13:21.061 --> 13:23.237
Who the fuck are you talking to
in there, man?

13:23.237 --> 13:25.848
I was talking to Dwight.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.503
- That's our boss.
- That is your boss!

13:28.503 --> 13:30.244
He's my fucking partner.

13:30.244 --> 13:32.028
I didn't sign up for this shit.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.900
I didn't sign up for anything.
He fucking extorted me.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.510
- You're a criminal, too.
- White-collar shit.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.468
Fucking stolen crypto,

13:37.468 --> 13:38.513
weed, pilfered goods.

13:38.513 --> 13:39.949
Not murder.

13:39.949 --> 13:42.778
- He was attacked, man.
- And then he handled it?

13:42.778 --> 13:44.649
You think I don't know
what the fuck that means?

13:44.649 --> 13:46.608
- You're better off not knowing.
- Yeah, well,

13:46.608 --> 13:48.001
that's very considerate of you

13:48.001 --> 13:50.177
not to make me
a fucking accessory.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.483
Man, we in this together.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.572
Whether you like it or not.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.792
I don't.

14:01.144 --> 14:02.972
Well, I guess you got
a decision to make.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.293
It's okay?

14:19.293 --> 14:20.860
I don't know.

14:23.601 --> 14:25.342
- All right, I got it.
- I got this, all right?

14:25.342 --> 14:27.257
So, look, we done been down
this road before.

14:27.257 --> 14:30.173
But I guess I got to clarify
some shit for y'all.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.914
We in a dangerous business.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.350
Most of the time

14:33.350 --> 14:35.004
things are fine.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.878
But sometimes
the shit can hit the fan.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.793
Last night it did hit.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.970
Due to a heavy wind that blew
this way from Kansas City.

14:43.970 --> 14:47.234
Are we talking, like, Mafia?

14:47.234 --> 14:49.192
Yes.

14:49.192 --> 14:50.498
The boss of that city,

14:50.498 --> 14:52.848
he somehow made it up
in his head that

14:52.848 --> 14:55.111
Tulsa belongs to his family.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.374
Well, it doesn't
and it never will.

14:58.419 --> 15:00.769
It belongs to our family.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.903
So if any of you
want to leave...

15:06.644 --> 15:08.995
...there's the door.

15:21.833 --> 15:23.879
All right, I got it from here.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.146
[sighs]

15:30.146 --> 15:32.018
Are you okay?

15:34.455 --> 15:36.109
I'm good.

15:39.547 --> 15:41.549
- Oh, fucking shit.
- [Tyson] All right, y'all.

15:41.549 --> 15:42.724
Let's-let's pick up Mitch and
get on the motherfucking road.

15:42.724 --> 15:44.378
- Let's do it.
- Calm down.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
- Where you guys headed?
- Galena.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.034
We got wind turbines.
It's a business investment.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.687

Yeah, we're, uh,

- You got to admit that.

- [Bodhi] It's a great name.

Ah, too many,
I'll tell you that.

20:22.569 --> 20:24.571
Way too many.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.007
Listen, you want to know

20:26.007 --> 20:28.227
how music started?
Where it all began?

20:28.227 --> 20:29.706
Do I have a choice?

20:29.706 --> 20:32.143
40,000 years ago
or maybe a few thousand years

20:32.143 --> 20:33.971
more than that,

20:33.971 --> 20:36.322
the first instrument
was, like, a flute

20:36.322 --> 20:38.498
made out of bird bone.

20:38.498 --> 20:39.977

- Yeah!

- Canned Heat, exactly.
- Oh, shit.

42:46.520 --> 42:50.959
