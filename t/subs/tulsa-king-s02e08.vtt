-[Tyson] What's the plan?
-[Dwight] We wait.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.710
-My pops is nearly dead!
-Easy. Easy.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.279
It was Bevilaqua. What the fuck?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.181
You don't make a move
until we know

00:13.247 --> 00:14.982
what we're up against.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.017
All's I know is whoever tried
to kill you, it wasn't us.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.319
What about Thresher?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.653
-What about him?
-Did you see

00:19.687 --> 00:21.322
any of his cronies
driving a white Prius?

00:21.355 --> 00:23.157
Him? You think that...

00:23.191 --> 00:25.159
I'm sorry, I'm just,
I'm caught in the middle here.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.161
There's only one side, Armand.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.497
What happened?

00:29.530 --> 00:31.199
Explosive went off too early.

00:31.265 --> 00:32.833
What happens when
Manfredi finds out about this?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.468
'Cause he sure as shit will.

00:34.502 --> 00:37.138
I could go to Dwight,
make a business arrangement.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.707
But not with Chickie out front.
So let me move Chickie aside.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.510
We got to go to the bosses.
We got to get this sanctioned.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.178
Something you want to tell me?

00:44.212 --> 00:45.846
I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:45.879 --> 00:47.381
I'm gonna find that white Prius.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.483
And when I do, I'm gonna burn

00:49.517 --> 00:52.720
your world
to the fucking ground.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.688
Tough times don't last,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.224

...if this was the real mafia,

01:28.356 --> 01:33.261
I have grounds to take you out
right now.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.130
It's payback for my father.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.365
Your father's still alive.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.599
So is the other guy.

01:38.632 --> 01:40.268
That's not the point.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.237
You created a big problem
for everybody.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.572
[Mitch] It's a miracle
you got away with it.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.207
Ten ways you could have
gotten caught.

01:46.240 --> 01:48.776
There are much better ways
to handle things like this.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.744
You're supposed to plan,
to think ahead.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.247
You don't just storm in
like some fucking cowboy,

01:53.281 --> 01:56.584
where you can get wasted,
or worse, arrested.

01:56.617 --> 01:57.918
How is arrested worse?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.488
Because you jeopardize
everybody.

02:02.556 --> 02:05.559
There's a hierarchy,
steps to follow.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.362
You go to the boss first,
and he gives you the okay.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.398
Even then,
you still gotta seriously plan,

02:10.431 --> 02:12.433
for Chrissakes.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.034
So...

02:15.303 --> 02:18.306
[stammering]
So what we gonna do here?

02:18.339 --> 02:21.342
I'm out?
Y'all getting rid of me?

-He doesn't get it.
-Nope.

02:23.877 --> 02:24.978
[Dwight]
He still doesn't get it.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.447
You don't get it, do you?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.616
You're part of a family.

02:28.649 --> 02:33.621
That means we're here
to protect you no matter what.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.256
Even when you're wrong, Tyson.

02:37.391 --> 02:41.195
But you can't put us
in fucking jeopardy.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.197
You gotta try
to protect us, too.

02:44.598 --> 02:47.268
So you gotta think.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.270
Be responsible for your actions.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.505
-Okay.
-[Dwight] Okay?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.809
Go home, clean up.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.045
Start over.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.257

I'm on it.

He's a good kid.
He'll be all right.

03:23.737 --> 03:26.774
Yeah, he'll be all right.
He's-- He's young.

-[Art] Jacked up on morphine,

03:43.223 --> 03:44.658
but he's all right.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.327
Took two fucking bullets.

He see who did it?

03:47.761 --> 03:49.563
-No.
-[Bevilaqua] All right,

we're gonna hit fucking Tulsa,
and we're gonna hit 'em hard.

-Do you understand me?
-Fuck yeah.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.201
Yeah, we should have done it
last night.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.103
The fuck you say?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.106
Nothing. You know,
just for Vic's sake, I think...

-You questioning me?
-No.

You keep your mouth

-A bunch of fucking misfits.
-Any shooters?

I don't know and I don't give
a fuck; what does it matter?

04:11.752 --> 04:13.120
Well, I'm just trying
to strategize. I want to know--

I don't give a fuck

04:31.572 --> 04:33.106
-That's why, Chickie.
-What did?

04:33.140 --> 04:35.008
He tried to clip one of
my fucking guys. Manfredi.

No, he's not okay.
He's fucking shot.

Was it you, Chick?

04:52.826 --> 04:54.161
Of course not.

Well, then,
it was fucking Manfredi.

If it's the last fucking thing
I do, Chickie,

05:04.405 --> 05:06.407

07:14.768 --> 07:16.570
There was an attempt
on Dwight's life,

07:16.604 --> 07:19.306

this guy was involved.

11:58.952 --> 11:59.987
What you mean?

12:00.020 --> 12:01.721
Tried calling after you left.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.490
I was worried.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.927
Just went home.

12:06.994 --> 12:09.629
And cut my phone off. I didn't
even know you was awake.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.233
I was in and out.
But I heard enough.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.037
Anything you need to tell me?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.873
Oh, no. It's all good.

12:19.907 --> 12:21.875
-Is it?
-Yeah.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.045
'Cause you were pretty upset.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.614
I was just chatting,
blowing off steam.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.219
Don't do anything foolish,
Tyson.

12:39.159 --> 12:41.028
I was just gonna go.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.831
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.299
-[chuckles]
-[Tyson] I love you.

12:52.806 --> 12:53.941
What's going on?

12:55.708 --> 12:57.610
I can't face him right now.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.112
I don't even want
to look at him.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.118
Baby, you almost lost me.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.289
Are we gonna lose our son?

13:11.024 --> 13:13.026
I think we already have.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.434
All right, what do you got?

13:21.468 --> 13:22.469
[Bigfoot]
Yeah.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.137
I'm here on Front Street.

13:24.204 --> 13:26.273
There's no business here.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.008
-It's an empty lot.
-[quietly] Fuck.

13:28.075 --> 13:29.409
All right,
come back and pick me up.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.377
Got you.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.980
[Armand] When I tell you
to fucking do something,

13:33.013 --> 13:35.615
I don't mean tomorrow,
you understand?

13:35.648 --> 13:36.917
Why are you yelling at me?

13:36.950 --> 13:38.651
-I'm doing what you asked.
-Really?

13:38.685 --> 13:39.953
You think our clients want
to come here

13:39.987 --> 13:41.488
and see their horses living
in filthy stalls?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.323
-The stalls are clean.
-Clean?

13:43.356 --> 13:44.657
There's fucking shit
all over the floor.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.825
You giving me
an attitude now?

13:45.893 --> 13:47.027
I'm not giving you an attitude.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.628
I'm just trying to explain

13:48.661 --> 13:50.130
-that I don't think...
-Fuck your explanations.

13:50.163 --> 13:50.864
I don't want
to fucking hear it, okay?

13:50.931 --> 13:52.299
Hear what? I didn't do anything!

13:52.332 --> 13:53.800
No, none of you
do anything, right?

13:53.833 --> 13:55.969
You're a bunch
of fucking saints.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.570
You know what you can do,
little miss ass-kiss?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.472
You can take that piece of shit
Dwight calls a horse

13:59.506 --> 14:01.341
to the fucking glue factory.

14:01.374 --> 14:02.342
-Okay.
-All right?

14:02.375 --> 14:03.810
-Okay.
-Yeah? Yeah?

14:03.843 --> 14:04.811
-You know what? I'm done here.
-Good.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.113
Get out of my fucking sight!

14:06.146 --> 14:07.480
Oh! Whoa!

14:07.514 --> 14:09.849
What the hell is going on here?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.818
He's crazy.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.021
I'm trying to do
my job here, Margaret.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.389
This kid is...

14:18.125 --> 14:19.426
Are you drunk?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.929
I had a drink, so?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.331
Go home.
I'll get someone to--

14:24.364 --> 14:26.333
I don't have a fucking home!

14:26.366 --> 14:28.201
I have a shithole
one-room apartment!

14:28.235 --> 14:29.402
[Margaret]
Armand...

14:30.570 --> 14:32.172
I know you're struggling,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.007
but this behavior is
not acceptable.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.976
You're gonna lecture me
about what's acceptable?

14:36.009 --> 14:38.245
Your boyfriend is
a fucking murderer

14:38.311 --> 14:39.947
who ruined my life.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.950
You're fired.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.518
What?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.354
Get your shit
and get out of here.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.789
Get off my property before
I have you fucking thrown out!

14:50.723 --> 14:51.858
[Armand scoffs]

14:53.060 --> 14:55.195
You and Dwight, huh?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.597
Match made in fucking heaven.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.771
Think you can you handle
interim stable manager?

15:06.173 --> 15:08.041
Of course. Yeah.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.244
[exhales quietly]

15:11.311 --> 15:14.114
All right, boys,
run to the car.

15:15.748 --> 15:16.950
[Joanne]
He's gonna be upset

15:17.017 --> 15:19.386
he didn't get to say
goodbye to you.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.054
Yeah, well.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.555
I've cried enough,

15:22.589 --> 15:24.624
I don't think
I could handle any more.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.895
Plus, you know,
it's better this way.

15:29.896 --> 15:31.931
-What're you gonna do?
-I don't know.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.067
Get a job.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.602
You know, I'd go with you,

15:35.635 --> 15:37.104
but I need to stay here
for your dad.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.272
No, no, no. It's-it's good
that you're here for him.

15:40.873 --> 15:44.411
He won't admit it, but...
he doesn't like to be alone.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.014
Yeah. [laughs]
I know, I know.

15:49.816 --> 15:52.219
-I love you.
-[Joanne] I love you, too.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.690
I'll call you
when we're settled in?

15:57.724 --> 15:58.925
-[Joanne] Yeah.
-Okay.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.027
All right.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.394
Okay.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.102
[vehicle door closes]

16:09.136 --> 16:10.103
[Dwight]
All right, guys.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.472
Come on, listen up.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.641
Last night, an attempt was made

16:14.674 --> 16:17.610
on one of Bevilaqua's men
in Kansas City.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.147
-Whoa.
-Shit just got real.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.581
Very real.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.116
-Attempt by who?
-The less we know the better.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.584
-[Dwight] Right.
-When you say "attempt..."

16:24.617 --> 16:26.286
Well, the guy's still alive.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.687
This have something
to do with Tyson?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.156
I notice
he's conspicuously missing.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.790
[Grace]
I noticed that, too.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.025
[Fred] And what about Armand?
He isn't here, either.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.626
Fred, I wouldn't worry
about Armand.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.163
The main thing is we got
to close this place down

16:36.229 --> 16:38.098
-and the casino fast.
-What, we just walk away?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.832
[Bodhi] Yeah, we have
a shit ton of inventory,

16:39.899 --> 16:41.168
that we need to store properly.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.802
[Dwight]
I don't care.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.637
Just got to do
whatever you got to do fast

16:44.671 --> 16:46.106
and close this place down.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.840
-Tonight.
-Then what?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.942
Well, then we, uh,
lay low for a while

16:49.976 --> 16:51.878
and figure out
what Kansas City is gonna do.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.846
Is this like
going to the mattresses?

16:53.913 --> 16:55.282
-It's...
-[Grace] Why do they call that,

16:55.315 --> 16:56.183
-anyway?
-It means hunkering down,

16:56.216 --> 16:57.350
getting ready for war.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.319
From The Godfather, right?

16:59.352 --> 17:00.653
[Bodhi]
Yes, but it was an expression

17:00.687 --> 17:01.954
used in Italy before that,
by the Romans.

17:01.988 --> 17:03.523
Did the Romans even
have mattresses?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.192
Well, I don't think they just
slept on the floor.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.826
-Wait. Did they?
-[Bodhi] I don't know.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.662
The expression's probably used
by the Camorra in Naples.

17:09.696 --> 17:12.399
Bodhi, enough of the fucking
history of mattresses, okay?

17:12.465 --> 17:15.202
We're in a crisis.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.070
All right, let's take off
and do what we got to do.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.139
Let's go. Fucking Camorra.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.040
Jesus.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.676
Plus, they slept
on fucking straw.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.178
[whirring nearby]

17:25.212 --> 17:27.180
We're looking
to swap out the Tahoe.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.648
Not to your liking?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.717
Uh, there's a little bit
of damage.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.352
Fender bender already?

17:32.385 --> 17:34.554
Uh, not that kind
of damage, Donnie.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.229
So, what'd you have in mind?

17:42.262 --> 17:45.064
I just got in a Chevy Suburban.

17:45.132 --> 17:48.067
Actually, you can have
whatever you want.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.403
Every car on this lot
will be yours once we close

17:50.437 --> 17:52.372
-that deal tomorrow.
-[Mitch] Speaking of which,

17:52.405 --> 17:54.241
I just got that contract
in last night.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.242
Excellent.

17:55.275 --> 17:56.343
What about that Escalade?

17:56.376 --> 17:57.910
[Mitch]
Ooh, a Caddy?

17:57.944 --> 17:59.512
I like where your head's at.
Yeah, what about that?

17:59.546 --> 18:01.614
-Let me run get you them keys.
-[Mitch] All right.

-From Santo.

18:24.971 --> 18:26.573
Good. Prick's been
ducking me for a week.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.341
You got this?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.644
Bevilaqua's making a move
on Dwight.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.414
That a good thing?

18:34.447 --> 18:37.083
-Or a bad thing?
-What do I care?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.419
We're better off
if it's a stalemate.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.787
How you figure that?

18:40.853 --> 18:43.423
Right now, neither of them has
any real power.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.293
Whoever wins, consolidate maybe,

18:46.326 --> 18:48.395
double their territory.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.330
Plus, there'll be no more
pitting one against the other.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.936

that's all.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.171
Do yourself a favor.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.273
Stay in your own fucking lane

for him to go.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.030

19:25.031 --> 19:26.833
But how's this gonna fly?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.801
Internally?

Everybody knows he's a psycho.

-The rumors about Pete?
-I mean with the other families.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.973
If we whack him?

Who said anything
about whacking him?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.479
There's other ways

You'll know
when you need to know.

19:47.387 --> 19:48.988
[Dwight]
I mean, Kansas City is

19:49.021 --> 19:52.392
not that big,
but they've got the resources,

19:52.459 --> 19:54.461
so we have to proceed
with caution.

19:54.494 --> 19:55.828
Grace.

Are you sure
you want the in on this?

-Yes.

Might be time to call
some backup.

How about Ahanu and his guys?

-[Goodie] The Indians.

-[Mitch whistles]

21:20.780 --> 21:22.482
I just hear
what I think I heard?

21:22.549 --> 21:24.484
You did.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.487
So, what do we do now?

21:28.455 --> 21:29.389
Nothing we can do.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.157
We can't
make a move on Bevilaqua.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.493
He got these two birds
watching us.

21:34.494 --> 21:37.497
So, let's eat, drink
and be merry while we can.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.731
Cheers.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.333
Salute.

21:40.400 --> 21:41.434
Yes, sir.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.503
-[birds singing]
-[insects trilling]

21:46.172 --> 21:48.608
Think of it more
as a proposition,

21:48.641 --> 21:50.142
a new arrangement, if you will.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.144
What's wrong with
the arrangement we have?

21:52.178 --> 21:54.113
Nothing, I'm just sure
that when you hear

21:54.146 --> 21:55.815
what I have in mind, you'll--

21:58.818 --> 22:00.387
Oh, shit.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.421
[Armand]
Mr. Thresher?

22:02.989 --> 22:04.491
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.125
I have to speak to you.

22:06.158 --> 22:07.727
What'd I tell you about
showing up here unannounced?

22:07.760 --> 22:09.496
-I didn't know what else to do.
-Let's talk later.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.163
-Yeah.
-Come meet me in the field when

22:11.197 --> 22:12.832
you're done.

22:12.865 --> 22:14.467
What is so important?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.502
Dwight knows
I've been talking to you,

22:15.535 --> 22:16.836
giving you information.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.137
You told him?

22:18.170 --> 22:19.806
I had no choice.
He's not fucking stupid.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.609
So-- so what are you here for?

22:22.642 --> 22:24.143
Do you want me
to protect you or something?

22:24.176 --> 22:27.480
And I was hoping maybe
you could advance me some money.

22:27.514 --> 22:29.015
Advance you?

22:29.048 --> 22:30.016
You're useless to me now.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.984
Well, I-I lost my job.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.453
Maybe I could work for you,

22:33.486 --> 22:35.321
some kind of
management situation.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.689
Management? [laughs]

22:36.723 --> 22:38.558
I wouldn't hire you
to sweep my floors.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.693
Please, please. Can you just

22:40.760 --> 22:42.028
let me borrow some cash,

22:42.061 --> 22:43.496
just a little bit
to tide me over?

22:43.530 --> 22:44.864
Just, like, five to ten grand.

22:44.897 --> 22:46.332
That's nothing to you.

22:46.365 --> 22:47.700
You're mighty generous
with my money.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.402
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean anything by it.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.570
Shut up.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.539
Here's a hundred.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.273
Go buy yourself a life.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.699
Hello?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.634
[Joanne]
Hey.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.102
In here.

23:24.737 --> 23:25.972
Where is everybody?

23:28.675 --> 23:29.942
Well, she left.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.347
I know she was leaving,
but I didn't think now.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.118
-Well, didn't you discuss that?
-We did, but...

23:41.654 --> 23:43.389
I wanted to say goodbye.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.811
You know, Joanne, I...

24:04.844 --> 24:07.379
I really didn't want her to go.

24:09.549 --> 24:10.750
I know that.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.619
***

24:16.623 --> 24:18.558
There's nothing left upstairs?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.562
I don't think so.

24:31.170 --> 24:33.172
Who are you calling?

[cell phone buzzing]

24:45.652 --> 24:47.286
[sighs]

24:48.521 --> 24:49.789
Dwight, what's up?

24:49.822 --> 24:51.090
Chickie.

24:52.692 --> 24:56.162
My daughter and my grandkids
are coming back to New York.

24:56.195 --> 24:57.997
Now.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.032
-Okay.
-Okay.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.968
Anything happens to them,

25:02.001 --> 25:04.003
they get a threat,

25:04.036 --> 25:06.005
they get a fucking phone call,

25:06.038 --> 25:09.008
someone follows them
down the street,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.209
I promise you,

25:10.276 --> 25:11.778
I will kill you slow.

25:12.712 --> 25:14.547
Relax.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.382
Nobody's interested
in your family.

25:16.415 --> 25:17.850
You better not.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.219
Put Vince on the phone.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.054
He ain't here.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.758
Well, you tell him what I said.

25:25.825 --> 25:27.226
Yeah.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.697
* quiet, dramatic music

25:30.730 --> 25:32.599
***

25:33.633 --> 25:35.267
Where's Vince?

25:36.603 --> 25:38.671
I got to go.

25:39.839 --> 25:40.907
Okay.

25:47.614 --> 25:48.948
Ugh.

25:50.316 --> 25:51.718
[Bodhi]
How we doing, guys?

25:51.751 --> 25:53.052
[Grace] That's pretty much
the last of it.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.754
The rest is in the refrigerator.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.255
Great.

25:56.322 --> 25:57.624
You guys can head out.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.925
Jimmy and I'll take care
of the rest.

25:58.958 --> 25:59.892
Are you sure?

25:59.926 --> 26:01.460
I'm happy to stay.

26:01.527 --> 26:02.895
Yeah, we'll be okay.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.063
I mean, I can make sure
that all this stuff

26:04.096 --> 26:05.397
gets put in the refrigerator.

26:05.431 --> 26:06.733
[Bodhi]
Yeah. You guys go home,

26:06.766 --> 26:08.935
stay there. We will be in touch.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.072
Call us if you need anything.

26:13.105 --> 26:14.807
Will do.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.578
[over phone]
Hey, it's Devin.

26:19.612 --> 26:22.749
Dad said I need one of these
outgoing things, so...

26:22.782 --> 26:24.250
talk when it beeps.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.285
-[phone beeps]
-[Armand] Hey, Dev, it's Daddy.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.721
Uh, just calling to see how
you and your brother are doing.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.122
I know I haven't been
around a lot

26:30.156 --> 26:31.658
lately, buddy.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.760
I'm so sorry. I miss you both.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.764
Listen, pal, I'm gonna talk
to you like a man now, okay?

26:37.797 --> 26:39.598
You're 14.

26:39.632 --> 26:41.634
So, I got to tell you something.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.637
Well, your old man, he...

26:44.704 --> 26:46.706
he really
stepped in it this time.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.308
Well, if I'm being honest,

26:49.341 --> 26:50.309
I've been stepping in shit
my whole life,

26:50.342 --> 26:51.678
one way or the other.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.846
But...

26:53.913 --> 26:55.648
um...

26:55.715 --> 26:57.784
you kids are the only thing
that ever made any sense to me.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.789
Look, I gotta
do something, okay?

27:02.822 --> 27:04.657
And then I'm gonna
go away for a while,

27:04.691 --> 27:06.793
so you and your brother,

27:06.826 --> 27:09.195
you may not be seeing
your dad for a long time.

27:10.429 --> 27:12.665
Just know that
I love you both very much,

27:12.732 --> 27:15.334
and this is not something
that I wanted to happen,

27:15.367 --> 27:17.336
but...

27:17.369 --> 27:20.840
you know, Dev, your past,

27:20.873 --> 27:23.175
it'll become your future
if you don't deal with it.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.511
You know?

27:25.544 --> 27:27.980
You gotta deal with it.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.648
You can't run from it
because it's always gonna be

27:29.682 --> 27:31.684
right there behind you,
chasing you.

27:31.751 --> 27:33.452
It's got your number.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.789
You gotta...
you gotta run towards it.

27:36.823 --> 27:37.690
You understand me?

27:37.757 --> 27:40.860
Meet that motherfucker head-on.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.532
Listen, Dev, do me a favor.

27:46.565 --> 27:48.868
Could you
and your brother maybe,

27:48.901 --> 27:52.004
I don't know, try and remember
the good times, too,

27:52.038 --> 27:54.373
'cause there was a lot of them.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.809
And I'm afraid
that when you think...

27:58.845 --> 28:00.847
...when you think about me,

28:00.880 --> 28:02.281
you're just gonna remember this.

28:05.451 --> 28:07.519
Anyway, I love you guys.

28:08.654 --> 28:10.289
That's it. Bye.

28:21.901 --> 28:24.570
When the fuck did we
get a grenade launcher?

28:24.603 --> 28:26.038
It was my aunt's.

28:26.072 --> 28:27.840
She left it for me in her will.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.909
It's the biker gang,
back of one of the trucks, man.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.043
I was gonna say,

28:31.077 --> 28:32.544
I thought my family
was dangerous.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.750
What do you want to do
with all this cash?

28:37.817 --> 28:40.552
Half a million of it
goes to Donnie Shore tomorrow.

28:40.586 --> 28:42.254
Leave it there.
We'll get it in the morning.

28:43.322 --> 28:48.060
* I don't want to hear
about your new shit *

28:48.094 --> 28:52.464

someone else all about it? *

* Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh *

29:03.675 --> 29:04.977
Excuse me, gentlemen.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.479
If you're here to visit
and you want to leave

29:07.546 --> 29:08.948
this car parked out
on the street,

29:09.015 --> 29:10.950
you're gonna need
a temporary parking pass,

29:11.017 --> 29:14.320
and that pass must be
displayed on the dashboard.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.956
Oh.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.590
Yeah, sorry about that.

29:18.624 --> 29:19.792
We were
just in the neighborhood,

29:19.859 --> 29:22.294
thought we'd drop in on
an old friend.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.296
Really? That's funny, I've never
seen you around here before.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.731
Who's your old friend?

29:25.764 --> 29:27.900
Oh, just an old
high school buddy.

29:27.934 --> 29:30.102
Oh, Mr. Manfredi.

29:30.136 --> 29:31.804
Well, I don't think he's home.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.840
Well, I appreciate that.

29:33.906 --> 29:35.975
We'll just come back then.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.409
Well, if you do,
make sure you ask

29:37.443 --> 29:38.444
Mr. Manfredi
about that parking pass,

29:38.477 --> 29:39.979
all right?

29:40.012 --> 29:41.480
Will do.

29:41.547 --> 29:42.982
Well, you tell
Mr. Manfredi I said hello.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.658
When I first came
to this country at 13,

29:52.691 --> 29:54.593

30:04.336 --> 30:06.005
I didn't even recognize it.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.107
Hmm.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.475
Taught myself the language,

30:09.508 --> 30:12.311
kept my ears open
and my mouth shut.

30:13.846 --> 30:16.048
And I learned about Americans.

30:16.115 --> 30:17.549
What'd you learn?

30:18.484 --> 30:19.751
That they're lazy.

30:19.785 --> 30:22.021
Spoiled.

30:22.054 --> 30:24.356
Do you know why
we succeed so quickly?

30:24.390 --> 30:27.159
Because we are willing
to be ruthless.

30:27.193 --> 30:28.895
Because we have nothing to lose.

30:28.961 --> 30:30.429
What does that
have to do with us?

30:32.164 --> 30:34.133

No.

No fucking joke.

gonna get away with this?

You have five seconds.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.117
Relax, Chickie. Take a seat.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.252
This doesn't
have to be contentious.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.121
-Take a seat.
-Oh, you heavy?

32:35.154 --> 32:36.022
Fuck you think?

32:37.189 --> 32:38.890
Take his gun.

32:39.825 --> 32:40.993
Chickie, on my kids,

32:41.060 --> 32:42.494
just as a precaution.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.875
Now, you want to tell me
what the fuck is going on?

32:59.145 --> 33:01.047
There's been conversations

33:01.113 --> 33:03.315
with the heads
of the other families,

33:03.349 --> 33:05.084
who give their full support.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.187
We're making some changes.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.989
There's no "we," Vince.

33:11.023 --> 33:13.192
There's only me.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.528
Yeah, well,
that's part of the problem.

33:17.863 --> 33:20.166
-You're being moved aside.
-Really?

33:20.199 --> 33:21.833
Obviously, this could've
gone a different way,

33:21.867 --> 33:23.302
but we didn't want to do that.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.670
You threatening me,
you disloyal--

33:24.703 --> 33:26.672
You've run this family
into the fucking ground!

33:26.705 --> 33:29.241
-Vince! Chickie! Relax!
-Motherfucker.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.178
Take a seat!

33:32.211 --> 33:34.113
The both of you, take a seat!

33:34.146 --> 33:36.215
Sit. Sit, right?

33:43.255 --> 33:44.490
Fuck.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.129
We all had abiding respect
for your father.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.132
But somehow you didn't
make it to his funeral.

33:53.165 --> 33:56.235
Oh, well, I was whooping it up
at Sloan-Kettering, you know.

33:56.302 --> 33:57.369
Maybe you remember.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.238
[chuckles]

33:59.305 --> 34:02.208
But the bigger point is,
the old guard,

34:02.241 --> 34:05.511
from the Bronx to the Belt,

34:05.544 --> 34:07.779
we built something together,

34:07.846 --> 34:09.581
a dynasty to last generations.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.117
But since Pete's passing--

34:11.183 --> 34:12.184
"Passing."

34:12.218 --> 34:14.153
Motherfucker!

34:16.222 --> 34:17.556
You...

34:17.589 --> 34:21.293
You whacked Jerry Izzo
for nothing.

34:22.961 --> 34:24.230
Revenue is drying up.

34:24.263 --> 34:25.931
The Albanians,

34:25.964 --> 34:28.200
they're grabbing
with both hands.

34:29.435 --> 34:32.204
And you send Dwight Manfredi
to Tulsa?

34:32.238 --> 34:34.606
Yeah. Where he went rogue.

34:34.640 --> 34:36.275
Well, what do you
expect him to do, huh?

34:36.342 --> 34:38.577
The man's a legend.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.279
You should've brought him
right back into the fold.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.214
Instead, you insult him,

34:42.248 --> 34:44.283
you banish him,

34:44.316 --> 34:46.318
all because of your ego.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.588
It wasn't my call.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.223
Oh, so you're blaming
your father now?

34:53.058 --> 34:54.260
It was a business decision

34:54.293 --> 34:56.228
so he could open up
a new territory.

34:56.262 --> 34:58.297
And how is that working out?

35:00.266 --> 35:02.968
[Fat Jimmy]
You lost the locker room, pal.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.003
That's the bottom line.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.210
Youse all feel that way?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.045
Huh?

35:16.482 --> 35:18.450
Effective immediately,

35:18.484 --> 35:20.152
this family's under
new leadership.

35:20.186 --> 35:22.354
You got Marine One
waiting outside for me?

35:22.421 --> 35:24.656
Take some time.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.192
Get the drinking under control.

35:28.594 --> 35:30.296
Couple of months,

35:30.329 --> 35:32.030
we'll see what's what.

-Hey, can I ask you a question?
-[locks door]

36:10.936 --> 36:12.638
Sure, fire away.

36:13.872 --> 36:15.674
What do you make of all this?

36:15.707 --> 36:19.378
Kansas City, us shutting down?

36:19.445 --> 36:22.381
Well, my great-grandfather
once told me a story

36:22.414 --> 36:24.350
about the Cree Nation.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.918
How a powerful, prideful people
were shoved

36:26.985 --> 36:29.321
to a corner of the Earth
that was barely livable.

36:29.355 --> 36:30.722
-Ah.
-Others in the tribe,

36:30.756 --> 36:32.258
they called it theft.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.493
Some called it rape, even.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.728
My grandfather
called it what it was.

36:36.762 --> 36:38.330
Inevitable.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.400
Yeah, you lost me.

36:41.467 --> 36:44.169
This was always
coming our way, Bodhi.

36:44.202 --> 36:48.173
We just didn't know how or when
or what it was gonna look like.

36:48.206 --> 36:52.511
Now that we know,
there's nothing stopping it.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.380
That is not very comforting.

36:54.413 --> 36:55.881
You asked.

36:55.914 --> 36:57.416
I did. [sighs]

37:00.786 --> 37:02.288
[door opens]

37:04.490 --> 37:06.124
[Bodhi sighs]

37:07.125 --> 37:09.528
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.263
Eh, this too shall pass.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.698
I mean, we'll be
back in business in no time.

Oh, fuck.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.469

37:50.502 --> 37:53.038
What? When?

37:54.740 --> 37:56.274
Come on, Jimmy's been hit.

37:56.308 --> 37:57.443
Ah, fuck.

37:57.476 --> 37:59.378
Goodie, stay put. Goddamn it.

38:00.646 --> 38:02.213
How many?

38:03.982 --> 38:05.317
Find them.

38:06.852 --> 38:09.488
They hit the weed store,
we got at least one of 'em.

38:09.555 --> 38:11.923
-Not Manfredi, though?
-No, they're still looking.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.124
Fuck.

38:13.158 --> 38:14.426
Hey, Skip, we got a visitor.

38:14.460 --> 38:16.227
What visitor? Who?

38:18.063 --> 38:20.131
-The fuck are you doing here?
-I need your help.

38:20.165 --> 38:21.166
-My help?
-Yeah.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.534
What about your partner?

38:22.601 --> 38:23.535
-Ming?
-Yeah.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.003
He's the problem.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.672
I'm in trouble,
and you might be, too.

38:26.738 --> 38:28.507
-Tell me about it.
-He's out of control.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.642
He forced me out. The cocksucker
threatened to kill me.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.345
How is that my problem, Cal?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.814
He's ruthless.
He's got an army.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.349
He wants to take over
everything.

38:37.383 --> 38:38.550
And it's not just gonna
stop with me.

38:38.617 --> 38:39.818
He wants everyone run out.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.453
And what do you want me to do?

38:41.487 --> 38:42.654
You want me to go to war
with this fucking loser?

38:42.688 --> 38:44.556
He's not a loser, he's a psycho.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.992
Bill, we can't let this guy win.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.994
Take what you want.
Take half of everything.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.529
I don't care,
we got to stop this guy.

38:50.596 --> 38:51.863
Cal, I-I don't have fucking time
for this right now.

38:51.897 --> 38:53.198
Okay?
I got problems of my own,

38:53.264 --> 38:54.700
thanks to your fucking
friend Manfredi.

38:54.733 --> 38:56.067
-My friend?
-Yeah.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.503
It was Ming who tried
to take him out.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.337
The fuck you talking about?

38:59.371 --> 39:00.472
Ming thought he was doing me
some kind of favor

39:00.506 --> 39:01.873
by blowing up Manfredi.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.875
It was a car bomb,
and he missed.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.379
You stupid motherfucker, do
you know what you fucking did?!

39:07.446 --> 39:08.747
-Hey!
-I'm in a fucking war right now

39:08.814 --> 39:10.382

39:31.503 --> 39:33.405
How'd you get in here?

39:33.472 --> 39:34.906
The door was unlocked.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.207
All right, well,
go have a drink.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.175
You're not allowed
to be back here.

39:37.208 --> 39:39.044
I don't want a drink.

39:39.077 --> 39:41.513
Or whatever. Go wait for me
by the bar till I finish up.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.683
-I'm sorry, Goodie.
-About what?

39:48.754 --> 39:50.088
What is this, a fucking joke?

39:50.155 --> 39:51.590
Just give me the money, okay?

39:52.858 --> 39:54.693
Smarten up, asshole,

39:54.726 --> 39:56.094
before I slap the shit
out of you.

39:56.127 --> 39:57.596
I'm not fucking around, Goodie.

39:57.629 --> 40:00.932
Now take your gun out slow
and put it on the floor.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.300
Go fuck yourself.

40:02.367 --> 40:04.169

I'm desperate!

40:05.236 --> 40:08.373
No, no, you're fucking suicidal.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.708
Now get the fuck out of here

40:09.741 --> 40:11.910
before you do something
you can't undo.

40:11.943 --> 40:15.180
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get your gun out.

40:15.213 --> 40:16.748
Now.

Motherfucker!

40:20.919 --> 40:22.253

get your fucking hands up.

40:23.955 --> 40:25.190
Get 'em up!

You're dead. You know that?

40:34.633 --> 40:37.335
-You're fucking dead!
-Shut up.

40:39.505 --> 40:40.706
Back up.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.509
Back the fuck up!

40:44.943 --> 40:46.745
Back up!

Where are you gonna go, huh?

find you, you motherfucker.
