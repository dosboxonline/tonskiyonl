00:18.977 --> 00:19.978
Hello, mon cher.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.439
Coach! Over here.

00:27.152 --> 00:28.570
Thank God.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.239
Z-man, Dani.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.869
He looks like a beautiful angel-man.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.250
Good morning, sunshine.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.668
You okay?

00:42.751 --> 00:45.128
I didn't want to miss the bus,
so I just slept in here.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.630
Sorry, I'm gonna vomit. Sorry.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.340
Oh, my God.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.684
Wait. What am I doing?
This is my fucking room.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.352
Oi! Out.

01:04.772 --> 01:05.858
Hey, you.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.694
Hey. Good morning.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.529
I got you a coffee.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.323
You been up long?

01:14.324 --> 01:15.325
Hour or two.

01:15.826 --> 01:18.161
You know? I guess three hours total.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.539
Last night was fun.

01:20.622 --> 01:23.876
Oh, yeah. Five stars. Certified fresh.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.337
-Have you got to go?
-Yeah.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.923
But, you know, you don't need
to rush out or anything.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.758
I got you a late checkout.

01:32.843 --> 01:34.595
That's very thoughtful of you.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.555
Go on then. You go.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.931
I'm gonna go back to sleep,

01:38.015 --> 01:41.894
and then I'm gonna order
a huge breakfast on your tab.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.979
That's a pro move right there. Yeah.

01:44.062 --> 01:46.440
Hey, I'll be your Underhills anytime.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.943
Okay. Well...
I'll see you around, I guess.

02:29.650 --> 02:30.651
Coach.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.363
Hey, Coach.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.740
-Coach.
-Yeah?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.825
-Something on your mind, Coach?
-No, why?

02:38.909 --> 02:41.370
We just had a five-hour bus ride
where you didn't talk a lick,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.455
and that's a record by about five hours.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.170
Okay, look. I'm gonna tell you something

02:50.254 --> 02:52.297
but then I don't wanna talk about it
ever again, okay?

02:52.381 --> 02:53.966
-Okay.
-I'm serious.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.467
I don't want to make jokes about it.

02:55.551 --> 02:57.970
I don't want you giving me
any knowing glances.

02:58.053 --> 02:59.346
-You know what I mean? Okay.
-Okay.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.642
Last night, I...

03:04.935 --> 03:07.187
I slept with Rebecca's friend Sassy.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.942
-Want to talk about it?
-I'd love to. Yeah. Immediately.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.405
There you are.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.156
I thought this room was haunted.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.409
No. We sorted that.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.786
Is now a good time?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.080
Yeah. You can come in.
She can't hear anything with those in.

03:25.163 --> 03:26.164
You sure?

03:27.249 --> 03:29.626
Gail, you think the royal family
are lizards, right?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.256
Twenty-three. So young.

03:34.339 --> 03:35.674
What's she listening to?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.467
Always murder podcasts.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.805
Last night was crazy.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.975
Right, yeah. It was pretty sloppy.

03:46.143 --> 03:50.022
I could really use a bucket of coffee
to nurse this hangover.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.943
Do you wanna go get one with me
when you're done?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.696
Not today. I can't. I'm busy.

03:57.779 --> 03:58.989
He's lying.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.534
Right. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave,

04:02.618 --> 04:05.579
'cause she's about to go to town on my
hamstrings and I make a lot of noises,

04:05.662 --> 04:07.414
and I don't like people hearing my noises.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.708
Cool. All right.
I'll see you around, yeah?

04:10.375 --> 04:11.376
Okay.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.757
'Cause, look, it's just not something
I've ever done before, okay?

04:16.839 --> 04:20.260
And look, I got no judgment on people
that have one-night stands, okay?

04:20.344 --> 04:24.473
I mean, if you are, you know, nuts
for butts, have at it. That's what I say.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.682
Coach, did you have fun?

04:25.766 --> 04:28.393
Come on, Coach.
I don't like all that kiss-and-tell stuff.

04:28.477 --> 04:31.021
Coach, did you have fun?

04:34.191 --> 04:35.359
And did she have fun?

04:37.945 --> 04:41.156
Yeah, that movement's
making me feel queasy.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.950
Okay. So, then what's the problem?

04:43.033 --> 04:45.744
I mean, maybe I just haven't really
come to peace with the fact

04:45.827 --> 04:50.082
that I went from having a mental breakdown
at a karaoke joint in Liverpool

04:50.165 --> 04:52.543
to, you know,
sleeping with a woman I just met.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.087
And then somewhere in between there,
getting a divorce.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.798
-Well, it makes sense to me.
-I must say that this is lovely.

04:58.632 --> 04:59.633
Ever since I was little,

04:59.716 --> 05:01.844
I always used to dream
about sitting down with a bunch of mates

05:01.927 --> 05:04.012
talking about the complex dynamics
between men and women.

05:06.557 --> 05:09.017
Okay, here's another question for y'all.
Should I tell Rebecca?

05:09.101 --> 05:11.186
-No.
-Come on now. Why not?

05:11.270 --> 05:14.189
I mean, it'd break my heart if I found out
she was hiding something from me.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.363
-What's happening? You having a meeting?
-Yep. I'm having lady problems.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.282
-I'd love to get your perspective on it.
-No.

05:24.825 --> 05:25.951
Ted, can I be honest with you?

05:26.034 --> 05:27.244
Come on, let it rip.

05:27.327 --> 05:31.290
You seem intent on going 12 rounds
with yourself. Why?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.250
What did you do wrong?

05:34.084 --> 05:35.085
He's right.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.254
Time to get you some of these.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.672
What, scissors?

05:38.755 --> 05:40.507
Yeah. To cut yourself some slack.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.760
Wow.

05:44.553 --> 05:47.014
Y'all stuck the landing on that.
That was nice.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.808
Tell you what, I gotta get you all
some satin jackets made,

05:49.892 --> 05:53.478
with "Ted Lasso's Personal Dilemma Squad"
embroidered on the back there.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.564
That's a clunky name.
There's gotta be something better here.

05:55.647 --> 05:59.151
Let me think. I know.
How about the "EQ Warriors"?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.278
The "Knights of Support"?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.239
Nah. Sounds like a brand of jockstrap.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.868
The "Proud Boys"?

06:10.370 --> 06:11.830
What about the "Diamond Dogs"?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.501
Attaboy, Nate. Diamond Dogs it is.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.761
Come on, Roy.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.898
I thought you were supposed to be
in Manchester.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.983
We played West Ham, so I'm in town.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.654
Yeah. Come in. How you doing?

06:43.737 --> 06:44.863
Yeah, I'm good.

06:45.447 --> 06:48.075
I had ten touches,
I had two completed dribbles,

06:48.158 --> 06:49.993
and in the 89th minute
they let me take a free kick.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.870
I scored. Got half a chub.

06:51.954 --> 06:55.123
So you thought you'd bring
your half-chub over here then, right?

06:55.207 --> 06:57.793
No. No, I just... wanted to talk.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.797
You know, everything happened so fast
when Lasso dumped me.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.676
Oi. Come on. Lasso didn't dump you.
Man City wanted you back.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.470
No, no. Lasso could have stopped it,
but he didn't. Yeah.

07:08.554 --> 07:11.181
Just let me finish, yeah?

07:13.433 --> 07:14.852
I dated a lot of girls, right?

07:14.935 --> 07:19.731
But you, you saw an even greater Jamie
inside an already great Jamie.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.527
You made me cultured.
Took me to plays and shit.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.945
You hated all of that.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.113
Yeah, 'cause it's confusing.

07:26.196 --> 07:29.324
They do all these emotional things,
make you feel all these emotional ways.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.660
And then they get mad
when you start trying to shout out

07:31.743 --> 07:33.370
and talk to them during a performance.

07:34.329 --> 07:35.539
It's weird.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.669
You also taught me to try
to not get in me own way so much.

07:40.752 --> 07:44.256
So... thank you for that.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.509
You're welcome, Jamie.

07:52.097 --> 07:54.349
You know, this is the first time
you've been over to this house

07:54.433 --> 07:56.435
and you haven't sent me
some, like, weird sex emoji.

07:56.518 --> 08:01.064
-Like the eggplant or the squirting water.
-Or the little squirrel.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.192
The little squirrel.
I never understood that one.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.235
Well, he's holding a little nut, isn't he?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.528
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

08:06.612 --> 08:07.779
He is. Yeah.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.241
Right.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.868
Do you wanna have a drink with me?

08:13.911 --> 08:14.912
Nah.

08:18.207 --> 08:20.959
Unless by "drink" you mean...

08:23.837 --> 08:25.714
So that's how you get sex?

08:26.465 --> 08:28.300
By not trying for sex?

08:28.842 --> 08:33.679
Sometimes that is exactly how it works.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.557
I never knew that.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.730
Morning, boss.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.734
Now, you don't just get biscuits today.

08:45.817 --> 08:48.570
I also got you a little box
of chocolate truffles.

08:48.654 --> 08:51.156
Oh, you fucker. Don't do this to me.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.534
What you should do is take
one of them truffles

08:53.617 --> 08:56.245
and smoosh it in between the biscuits
like it's a little breakfast sandwich--

08:56.328 --> 08:57.704
Yeah, there you go. You got it.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.289
Yeah.

09:00.082 --> 09:04.670
Yeah. And hey, I wanna thank you again
for being there for me up in Liverpool.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.923
-It was nothing, Ted.
-No, no. It was something.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.843
You got a coupon for life, young lady.
Yeah. I got your back.

09:10.926 --> 09:14.221
Think of me as your own
personal metaphorical Saint Bernard.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.890
You don't need to be dealing
with a metaphorical avalanche

09:16.974 --> 09:20.227
to avail yourself to the metaphorical
bourbon hanging around my neck.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.937
Metaphorically speaking. Okay?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.021
All right now.

09:23.105 --> 09:24.314
Actually, Ted.

09:24.940 --> 09:26.775
If you do want to be there for me,

09:26.859 --> 09:30.112
I have a meeting later
with two minority owners of the club.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.196
The Milk sisters.

09:31.280 --> 09:33.407
The most horrible human cocktail

09:33.490 --> 09:36.994
of being terribly dull
and yet, they never shut up.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.078
Please join me.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.329
Done and doner.

09:40.122 --> 09:43.041
Perfect. I can just introduce you all,

09:43.125 --> 09:45.836
leave you wittering on,
and slip out and do anything else.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.045
How much of the club they own?

09:47.129 --> 09:48.297
2.9%.

09:48.380 --> 09:52.301
I'm gonna round that down to two.
Then I can call those gals the "2% Milks."

09:52.384 --> 09:53.969
Oh, God. They're gonna adore you.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.805
It's gonna be fun. All right.
I'll leave you be. See ya now.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.518
In my experience, I've always found
that endorsements work best

10:01.602 --> 10:03.020
if you really believe in the product.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.731
So, I can find good opportunities
for you guys

10:05.814 --> 10:07.524
if you let me know what you're into.

10:07.608 --> 10:08.817
I love Air Jordans.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.069
I'd fuck a pair of Jordans.

10:11.737 --> 10:13.447
All right. So, athletic wear then, yeah?

10:13.530 --> 10:15.532
I'm into issue-oriented products.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.409
You know,
pro-environment or anti-pollution.

10:17.492 --> 10:18.535
That kind of thing.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.412
Oh, and also Air Jordans.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.206
But I don't want to sleep with them.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.749
Isaac, what about you?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.501
Rolos.

10:26.210 --> 10:29.546
So, sweets and chocolate then?

10:29.630 --> 10:32.299
No. Just Rolos, yeah?

10:32.883 --> 10:34.885
And none of that Sour Patch
bullshit either, yeah?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.512
Okay.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.139
Well, that's a great start from you guys.
Thank you.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.351
Hey, Captain.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.230
What's all this?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.148
Rebecca's letting me use this room
as my office

10:48.232 --> 10:50.943
until she sets me up with somewhere
proper. That's why I have this.

10:51.026 --> 10:53.695
So if they need to use the room,
I can just shove everything into it.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.822
Efficient.
Do you want to see a movie later?

10:56.448 --> 10:58.492
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-What?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.702
I asked you if you wanted
to go get coffee with me yesterday

11:00.786 --> 11:02.538
-and you said you were busy.
-I was busy.

11:02.621 --> 11:05.040
-You never texted me back last night.
-Yeah. I was busy.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.042
What about the kiss?
You took off like it was a shit kiss,

11:07.125 --> 11:09.002
and it was not a shit kiss. I was on fire.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.880
-I agree.
-So what is your fucking problem, Roy?

11:11.964 --> 11:14.299
Listen, I'm a professional footballer.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.510
I have had a million one-night stands.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.594
-So have I.
-Great.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.513
-I don't know why we're bragging about it.
-Neither do I.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.599
And they always feel empty.
Well, not the first part.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.643
-No, at first they're wicked.
-They're fucking great.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.020
-But when it's all done, I feel like--
-Like shit.

11:27.104 --> 11:30.148
Exactly. And I always end up
with my watch being stolen

11:30.232 --> 11:32.609
or a story in the press
about how my penis has a curve in it.

11:32.693 --> 11:33.986
Does it actually?

11:34.069 --> 11:35.904
No, I just make it feel like it does
with my hips.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.782
Anyway, the point is,
I'm trying to do this differently.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.452
I should have told you that. I apologize.

11:42.536 --> 11:48.584
And I am trying to be more honest.

11:49.293 --> 11:50.294
Thank you.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.087
Okay, then.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.884
I think you should know
that I slept with Jamie.

11:56.967 --> 11:58.051
Yes, I am aware of that.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.511
I mean last night.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.890
I didn't think you were into me.

12:02.973 --> 12:05.392
I didn't know what you wanted,
and I knew exactly what he wanted.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.145
So you fucked him to get back at me
for something I didn't even know I did.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.898
No. I-- No.

12:11.565 --> 12:12.649
No.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.734
Yes.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.236
Yup. That's exactly what I did.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.991
I fucked up, Roy. I'm really sorry.

12:22.492 --> 12:24.077
But I need you to be okay with this.

12:26.455 --> 12:28.916
Well, why don't you just come
and tell me how you feel about it

12:28.999 --> 12:30.542
once you've figured out
how to speak again?

12:45.349 --> 12:46.350
Hi, Roy.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.106
Something on your mind?

12:54.608 --> 12:57.277
Is that grunt all I get to go on?

12:57.361 --> 12:59.947
That's okay. I'll give it a shot here.
Let's see.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.950
You are thinking about
buying your first house.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.202
No, not that. Okay.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.497
You just realized your dad
might be a little racist.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.124
Stop. He's in his 60s
and he's from South London.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.543
Of course my dad's a little racist.

13:12.626 --> 13:15.379
Look, me and Keeley
might be starting up a thing,

13:15.462 --> 13:18.882
but every time I think about her,

13:18.966 --> 13:21.260
all I think about is Jamie fucking Tartt.

13:23.720 --> 13:27.599
Sounds to me like someone's trapped
inside life's most complicated shape.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.684
A love triangle.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.937
Second place of course is
the "I just walked in on my mother-in-law

13:32.020 --> 13:34.106
changing into her swimsuit" dodecahedron.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.900
Does my face look like it's in the mood
for shape-based jokes?

13:36.984 --> 13:38.318
No, Roy, it does not.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.946
But, in my defense, it rarely does.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.073
I know exactly what to do here, though.

13:44.032 --> 13:45.576
What are you doing?

13:45.659 --> 13:47.661
Don't you fret, my fine furry fella.

13:47.744 --> 13:51.707
In a matter of minutes, your relationship
dilemma will be in the past.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.168
For I am rounding up the Diamond Dogs.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.295
Who the fuck are the Diamond Dogs?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.672
It's just a group of people who care, Roy.

13:58.755 --> 14:01.884
Not unlike folks at a hip-hop concert
whose hands are not in the air.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.136
Okay, so this is about
you and Keeley, right?

14:04.678 --> 14:07.806
-Saw this coming.
-Nothing like the early days of courtship.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.600
Okay, this is my fucking nightmare.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.519
I think the idea of you and Keeley
is like cookies and cream.

14:12.603 --> 14:15.898
And I think we all agree, two great tastes
that go great together, right?

14:15.981 --> 14:17.191
-Yeah.
-Perfect analogy.

14:17.274 --> 14:20.027
Yes, I am into her.
But we all know who her ex-boyfriend is.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.154
The prince prick of all pricks.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.364
And I've got him stuck right in here.

14:24.448 --> 14:25.824
I don't understand the problem.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.576
I mean, Keeley's just so kind.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.330
You know, to be liked by someone like her
must be... 's wonderful.

14:31.413 --> 14:33.290
Shout out to the Gershwin brothers
right there.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.708
Fuck yeah, the Gershwins.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.418
But dang it, fellas,
you're still not getting it!

14:36.502 --> 14:37.461
Thank you.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.423
Sure, Roy here has slept with
a bunch of different people in his past.

14:41.507 --> 14:45.552
But Keeley's got her own romantic
and sexual history that predates Roy.

14:45.636 --> 14:46.970
And that's not okay!

14:47.888 --> 14:49.223
He means the opposite.

14:49.306 --> 14:51.183
I love it when Coach does sarcasm.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.227
I can't control my feelings.

14:53.310 --> 14:56.188
Well, then by all means
you should let them control you.

14:57.231 --> 14:58.315
He's doing it again.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.067
Good eye.

15:00.150 --> 15:02.986
Look, Roy, all this Chandler Bing-ing
aside, do me a favor.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.364
Don't let her past muck around
with y'all's future, okay?

15:05.447 --> 15:07.574
She slept with him last night.

15:10.244 --> 15:13.038
-I mean, are you two officially dating?
-No.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.082
-Have you already slept together?
-No.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.792
Coach, you wanna bring this home?

15:18.168 --> 15:20.629
Grow up and get over it.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.467
The Diamond Dogs have struck again.

15:29.721 --> 15:30.722
You're all pricks.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.855
All righty. See the Milk sisters anywhere?

15:37.938 --> 15:39.565
You want me to go skim the back room?

15:40.232 --> 15:42.234
-Don't make me regret this, Ted.
-Don't worry, don't worry.

15:42.317 --> 15:43.986
I'm gonna be an udder gentleman, okay?

15:44.069 --> 15:47.865
Hey, I wonder if they've ever seen
the movie Bridget Jones's Dairy.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.450
Sorry, that's not my breast milk pun.
I can do better.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.036
Oh, my God, this was a horrible idea.
Seriously, please go home.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.414
-Come on. It's gonna be fun.
-Stop.

15:57.416 --> 15:58.750
There she is.

16:02.421 --> 16:03.547
Rupert, what are you doing here?

16:03.630 --> 16:05.382
We came to celebrate.

16:05.966 --> 16:07.676
Rebecca, Rebecca. Rebecca, Rebecca.

16:07.759 --> 16:09.094
It's nice to see you again.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.847
-And this is Ted.
-Howdy.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.765
Yeah. Join us for a drink.

16:13.849 --> 16:16.226
Here you go, Rupert. Anything else?

16:16.310 --> 16:19.354
A couple more glasses
for our friends here. Thank you, Mae.

16:19.438 --> 16:23.400
You are as delicious as ever.
From your West End to your Marble Arch.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.985
Keep your Big Ben in your pants.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.240
Thank you for your invitation,

16:30.324 --> 16:32.117
but we're actually here
to meet with the Milk sisters.

16:32.201 --> 16:33.577
They won't be coming now.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.329
Oh, no. Did they expire?

16:35.412 --> 16:36.413
What?

16:37.331 --> 16:38.832
So, yeah, I...

16:40.167 --> 16:44.588
I know I'm not allowed
an ownership stake in the club,

16:44.671 --> 16:48.509
but they were nice enough to sell
their minority share to Bex here.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.720
I always thought I'd finish
paying off my student loans

16:51.803 --> 16:54.097
before I purchased a football club.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.894
Obviously, she needed
a little financial aid from yours truly.

16:58.977 --> 17:02.356
But, well, when we're married,
what's hers will be mine

17:02.439 --> 17:07.027
and what's mine... well, that'll stay mine
'cause I've learned from you.

17:07.653 --> 17:08.779
You're engaged?

17:13.116 --> 17:14.826
Hey. Congratulations.

17:14.910 --> 17:16.203
So you better join us for a drink.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.830
Everyone! Drinks with us. It's on me.

17:21.791 --> 17:25.503
Three lagers, please, Mae.
They're free. We want the boots.

17:26.505 --> 17:27.464
To Richmond!

17:27.548 --> 17:30.342
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

17:30.425 --> 17:32.386
Richmond! Richmond! Richmond!

17:33.387 --> 17:37.182
Right. The product you'd most like
to get into business with is joy?

17:37.266 --> 17:39.101
Sí. Mucho, mucho joy.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.104
I don't know if I can get you paid
for that though, Dani.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.356
I like to give away joy for free.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.025
-All right, thanks, Dani.
-You're welcome.

17:48.277 --> 17:50.988
Hey. Football is life, Capitán.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.447
Yup.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.329
I'm done being mad about Jamie.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.832
I'm a grown man. I'm not a baby child.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.668
I'm over it.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.379
Right. Would you mind saying that
to the rest of the room?

18:08.380 --> 18:10.007
I mean, the press deserves to know.

18:17.848 --> 18:18.891
Mr. Kent!

18:18.974 --> 18:21.727
-Yeah.
-Hi. Keeley Jones, The Independent Woman.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.354
Would you please repeat
what you just said?

18:25.189 --> 18:26.899
I'm over it.

18:26.982 --> 18:29.276
Can I take you out tonight? Please?

18:34.907 --> 18:35.908
Yeah. You.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.328
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman Online Edition.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.955
So, why should I trust
this sudden change of heart?

18:43.332 --> 18:45.292
'Cause I like you more than I hate him.

18:47.628 --> 18:49.880
I mean, barely. It's very close.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.425
Yeah. Woman with the hair.

18:53.509 --> 18:55.469
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman Magazine.

18:55.552 --> 18:58.263
Where would you take me if I did say yes?

18:58.347 --> 19:01.517
-I don't know. Coffee?
-Can't do any better?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.727
-Dinner.
-Yeah, that sounds great.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.151
Yeah, woman with the fucking eyes.

19:11.235 --> 19:14.029
Keeley Jones,
The Independent Woman insert on Sunday.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.948
Could you please elaborate
on the hip movement

19:16.031 --> 19:18.408
that makes your penis feel
like it has a curve in it?

19:18.492 --> 19:20.869
Right, no more questions.
We'll see you on the pitch.

19:24.289 --> 19:25.832
To Rupert!

19:27.668 --> 19:30.629
Friends, Richmonds, countrymen.

19:30.712 --> 19:33.841
Our club's nightmare is over now.
I'm back.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.885
Thank God. 'Cause Ted Lasso sucks.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.929
-No offense, Ted.
-All good, Baz.

19:39.012 --> 19:40.973
You, Jeremy, and Paul
have been refreshingly candid

19:41.056 --> 19:42.307
about y'all's feelings.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.351
Pretty cool Premier League gaffer
knows our names.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.103
-I know, right?
-Shut up, you twats.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.438
I'm trying again. No help.

19:48.522 --> 19:50.357
Right. So, if she hits the board,

19:50.440 --> 19:52.484
I want it to sound like
we just won the FA Cup.

19:58.907 --> 19:59.908
You wanna leave?

20:00.993 --> 20:02.452
I don't wanna give him the satisfaction.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.832
So, Rebecca,
it's time to be friends again.

20:06.915 --> 20:11.170
Especially since Bex and I
are gonna be sitting with you

20:11.253 --> 20:13.630
every week in that owner's box.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.882
I'm not going every week.

20:14.965 --> 20:16.425
Well, I am.

20:16.508 --> 20:21.346
And every week,
when they shove a camera in my face

20:21.430 --> 20:25.309
and ask me how I think you're doing,
I will tell them.

20:26.143 --> 20:28.896
It'll be relentless.

20:32.107 --> 20:35.986
So, Rupert, y'all take your darts
over here pretty seriously, huh?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.906
This and...
what's the billiard game y'all do

20:38.989 --> 20:40.866
that sounds like a brand of cookies?

20:41.491 --> 20:43.285
-Snooker?
-That's it. That's the one, yup.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.788
Boy, I'd love to curl up on a couch
under a weighted blanket,

20:46.872 --> 20:49.708
watch You've Got Mail
and devour a box of Snookers.

20:51.835 --> 20:52.836
See what we got here.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.005
Hey! There it is.

20:55.631 --> 20:58.842
-Do you like darts, Ted?
-They're okay.

20:58.926 --> 21:02.179
I'm more of a, you know,
cornhole man myself. Yeah.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.265
How about a game?

21:05.349 --> 21:09.561
We could, you know,
maybe wager, say, £10,000?

21:11.313 --> 21:14.650
Well, as my doctor told me when
I got addicted to fettuccine Alfredo,

21:14.733 --> 21:16.527
that's a little rich for my blood.

21:17.236 --> 21:19.196
How about this? If you win,

21:19.279 --> 21:21.823
I'll let you pick the starting lineup
of the last two games of the season.

21:22.366 --> 21:25.410
But if I win, you can't go
anywhere near the owner's box,

21:25.494 --> 21:27.037
at least not while Rebecca's
still in charge.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.330
Ted.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.415
What the hell are you doing?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.167
I believe some folks call it
white knighting,

21:32.251 --> 21:33.460
but I'm just following my gut here.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.545
-It's okay.
-No. Ted.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.464
-What do you think?
-You're on.

21:37.548 --> 21:39.800
-Okay.
-Double in, double out.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.718
Whatever you say, Rupe-a-dupes. Yeah.

21:41.802 --> 21:44.555
Just let me know
if I'm winning or losing, all right?

21:44.638 --> 21:46.557
I forgot I had these on me.

21:48.851 --> 21:50.394
Yeah. Wait a second.

21:51.395 --> 21:52.938
I forgot I'm left-handed.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.984
This is gonna be a hoot.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.363
-So where are we going for dinner?
-It's a surprise.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
Cool.

22:06.201 --> 22:07.536
I need to ask you something.

22:07.619 --> 22:11.290
So, the other day when you said
you were too busy to text me back...

22:11.373 --> 22:12.833
Yeah, 'cause I was busy.

22:12.916 --> 22:14.877
But you never told me
what you were too busy with.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.420
Yeah, 'cause it was private.

22:17.754 --> 22:19.506
Are you dating other people?

22:20.340 --> 22:23.260
It's okay if you are. It's just that
I wanna know so that I don't look stupid.

22:23.343 --> 22:25.053
It was yoga, okay?

22:25.137 --> 22:27.264
I do yoga with a group of women
in their 60s.

22:27.347 --> 22:28.640
They have no idea who I am,

22:28.724 --> 22:30.726
it's twice a week
and it's really good for my core.

22:30.809 --> 22:33.312
Normally only takes an hour,
but Maureen's been going through a divorce

22:33.395 --> 22:35.314
and she needed to talk about it
and blow off some steam.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.274
We all ended up at G-A-Y till 2:00 a.m.

22:37.357 --> 22:39.818
and then we had crepes in Balham
with some drag queens.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.114
Like I said, it's private.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.532
I'm gonna kiss you now.

22:45.616 --> 22:47.951
Unless it's gonna make you run away again.

22:48.035 --> 22:51.914
I know that you wanna take this slow
and I really do respect that, but it--

22:52.581 --> 22:56.376
Maybe I could just touch your arse
a little bit or you could touch mine--

23:05.677 --> 23:07.721
Where's your manners?

23:08.680 --> 23:10.599
You're supposed to ask
before you take something.

23:11.517 --> 23:13.685
For example, may I take this?

23:13.769 --> 23:15.521
-No.
-Well, I'm fucking taking it.

23:16.271 --> 23:18.565
Here. It's pictures of our first date.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.318
Come on. I'm cooking for you.

23:25.239 --> 23:27.407
One hundred and eighty!

23:27.491 --> 23:28.867
Well in, Rupert. Get in!

23:28.951 --> 23:31.453
Shut your stupid little twat mouth
or I will shut it for you.

23:32.829 --> 23:35.332
Shall I be giving you
the lineup card now, Ted?

23:35.415 --> 23:39.378
I shall be putting Obisanya
back on defense where he belongs.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.421
That's exactly what I said, didn't I?

23:41.505 --> 23:43.507
Now, now, it's not all Ted's fault.

23:43.590 --> 23:47.469
My ex-wife's the one who brought
the hillbilly to our shores.

23:47.553 --> 23:49.179
I know she's always been a bit randy,

23:49.263 --> 23:52.474
but I never thought
she would fuck over an entire team.

23:53.225 --> 23:54.309
Hey!

23:55.644 --> 23:57.688
Better manners when I'm holding a dart.

23:57.771 --> 23:58.856
Please.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.279
Mae. What do I need to win?

24:05.362 --> 24:07.447
Two triple 20s and a bull's-eye.

24:09.616 --> 24:10.617
Good luck.

24:13.787 --> 24:17.082
You know, Rupert, guys have
underestimated me my entire life.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.752
And for years, I never understood why.
It used to really bother me.

24:20.836 --> 24:23.505
But then one day,
I was driving my little boy to school

24:23.589 --> 24:27.092
and I saw this quote by Walt Whitman
and it was painted on the wall there.

24:27.176 --> 24:30.220
It said, "Be curious, not judgmental."

24:31.180 --> 24:32.306
I like that.

24:36.268 --> 24:38.604
So I get back in my car
and I'm driving to work,

24:38.687 --> 24:40.731
and all of a sudden it hits me.

24:40.814 --> 24:45.652
All them fellas that used to belittle me,
not a single one of them were curious.

24:46.737 --> 24:48.614
They thought they had everything
all figured out.

24:48.697 --> 24:52.201
So they judged everything,
and they judged everyone.

24:53.368 --> 24:55.913
And I realized
that their underestimating me...

24:57.873 --> 24:59.750
who I was had nothing to do with it.

25:01.585 --> 25:04.588
'Cause if they were curious,
they would've asked questions.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.381
You know?

25:06.465 --> 25:09.885
Questions like,
"Have you played a lot of darts, Ted?"

25:14.306 --> 25:17.434
To which I would've answered, "Yes, sir.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.646
Every Sunday afternoon
at a sports bar with my father,

25:20.729 --> 25:23.649
from age ten till I was 16,
when he passed away."

25:29.488 --> 25:30.906
Barbecue sauce.

25:37.788 --> 25:39.998
-Good game, Rupert.
-Come on, let's go.

25:41.041 --> 25:44.253
You are a very lovely consolation prize.

25:44.753 --> 25:47.589
Rebecca, Ted, enjoy your evening.

25:47.673 --> 25:48.966
Mae, as always.

25:49.591 --> 25:52.261
Holy shit, that felt good.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.137
That was fun. Yeah.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.515
-Only one thing left to do now.
-What's that?

25:59.017 --> 26:00.185
Do I have to?

26:03.230 --> 26:05.023
Drinks are on me!

26:19.121 --> 26:21.832
Fellas, I could watch you do this jaunty
North Korean military thing

26:21.915 --> 26:23.750
you do all day, but I need a favor.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.127
We'll die for you, Coach!

26:25.210 --> 26:27.462
That's a little dramatic, Sam,
but I see how you got there

26:27.546 --> 26:28.922
with me invoking the military and all.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.174
Now here's what we're gonna do.

26:30.257 --> 26:32.176
How many of you fellas
ever seen Sesame Street?

26:37.514 --> 26:40.309
-Good morning, Higgins.
-Good morning. One sec.

26:40.392 --> 26:42.352
Yeah, that's good. Straighten up.
All right.

26:43.270 --> 26:45.564
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hold on one sec. Let me get in my spot.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.524
Okay. Here it comes, here it comes.
Let's go.

26:53.030 --> 26:54.031
Hi, Ted.

26:54.615 --> 26:55.657
Can't hear you!

26:57.492 --> 26:59.203
Hi!

26:59.286 --> 27:01.038
Yeah! Yeah!

27:01.121 --> 27:02.706
We felt it, she felt it!

27:02.789 --> 27:05.292
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah! Yeah!

27:06.502 --> 27:08.170
Got up too fast.

27:09.213 --> 27:12.132
Ted embarrassed the hell
out of Rupert yesterday.

27:12.925 --> 27:13.926
That's good.

27:14.927 --> 27:15.928
Bit of bad news.

27:16.011 --> 27:21.016
We have ten thousand unsold seats
for the final match of the season.

27:21.099 --> 27:22.476
Release them to the visitors.

27:23.644 --> 27:26.855
But Rebecca, Man City will snap those up.

27:26.939 --> 27:30.108
Our home stadium
will be a sea of sky blue.

27:30.943 --> 27:32.361
That'll kill Rupert.

27:32.444 --> 27:36.281
It'll hurt our chances.
We're on the brink of relegation.

27:36.365 --> 27:37.783
Just do it, Higgins.

27:39.743 --> 27:41.954
Oh, you know, fuck off!

27:42.037 --> 27:43.205
Excuse me?

27:43.288 --> 27:44.540
I'm sick of it.

27:45.791 --> 27:49.920
You won't take away your pain
by constantly punishing Rupert.

27:50.003 --> 27:52.214
Where were these morals
when you were having lunches with me

27:52.297 --> 27:53.841
so Rupert could have sex in our house?

27:55.217 --> 27:56.677
I thought we were friends.

27:57.636 --> 28:01.473
You had every opportunity to do
the right thing and you never did.

28:01.557 --> 28:02.933
Fucking pussy.

28:03.725 --> 28:07.938
You're right. I deserve
to carry that around. I do.

28:08.021 --> 28:13.443
I should've been braver,
and I'm sorry for that. I am.

28:13.527 --> 28:17.239
But I'm saying this to you now. Stop it.

28:17.322 --> 28:18.615
Or what?

28:19.741 --> 28:20.742
I quit.

28:22.119 --> 28:23.662
I know how this goes.

28:24.204 --> 28:27.082
You'll come back, grovel for your job,
and I'll take you back,

28:27.165 --> 28:30.085
but I will make your life
just that little bit worse.

28:40.179 --> 28:41.430
Hi.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.893
You arranged
for the photographer to take this.

28:45.976 --> 28:48.520
Roy and I found it
on a paparazzi camera card.

28:48.604 --> 28:50.439
He said you hired him.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.192
Don't deny it
or pretend that you don't know.

28:55.027 --> 28:57.404
Either you come clean to Ted
or I'll do it for you.
