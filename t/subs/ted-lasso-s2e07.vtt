WEBVTT

00:22.523 --> 00:24.858
-Hey, babe.
-Hi, babe.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.450
Morning.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.535
Morning.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.291
Hey.

00:41.375 --> 00:42.376
Hey.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.388
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.397
Oi! You're not going to your office?

01:04.772 --> 01:09.278
No. I was just gonna go to the café
and get a cup of tea first.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.529
Cool.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.906
Can I come?

01:13.574 --> 01:15.033
Yeah, course.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.118
Sweet.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.435
That's right.

01:41.518 --> 01:45.647
Make another useless policy you're gonna
backtrack on in a week. Idiots.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.733
Talking to the newspapers again,
sweetheart?

01:48.317 --> 01:49.943
Let me know if they ever talk back.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.322
Hello, hello. Hey, Mom.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.324
-Hi, darling.
-Got you these. There you go.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.451
Thank you. What's the occasion?

01:57.534 --> 01:59.745
Nothing. You know, just an ordinary day.

02:01.872 --> 02:02.873
Hey.

02:04.333 --> 02:05.334
Look at that.

02:07.753 --> 02:09.003
That's a good one, that.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.511
Hey, Dad.

02:15.594 --> 02:16.845
Nathan.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.438
Would you look at that.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.526
They'll let anyone in the newspapers
nowadays, won't they?

02:32.778 --> 02:35.572
They say humility
is not thinking less of yourself

02:35.656 --> 02:37.783
but thinking about yourself less.

02:39.243 --> 02:41.870
My little boy wonder.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.873
Yeah, sorry, Mom, but it's Wonder Kid.

02:44.957 --> 02:49.086
Wunderkind, actually,
is what I think I said.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.214
But I just… didn't…

03:24.037 --> 03:26.498
-Hey, Doc.
-Hi, Ted. Come in.

03:26.582 --> 03:29.209
Yeah, okay. I wanted to thank you again

03:29.293 --> 03:31.962
for helping me out with that little hiccup
the other night.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.591
I'm actually feeling better, so I don't
know if this is necessary, really.

03:35.674 --> 03:37.176
Make yourself comfortable.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.011
Okay.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.848
Let me sit. I can sit here.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.517
It's noisy.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.104
Yes. You know what?
Hey, I'll, you know, go on the couch.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.564
Here we go. How about that?

03:51.648 --> 03:53.192
Hey, who am I?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.235
Don Draper, right?

03:56.612 --> 04:00.324
Yeah. Isn't that a little formal?
I don't wanna put my shoes on there.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.202
You know what? I'll lay down, right?
Here we go.

04:03.285 --> 04:07.456
I'll just pop my feet up here.
Like this, you know?

04:07.539 --> 04:10.584
Like a couple kids
on their top bunk on camp--

04:10.667 --> 04:12.669
I don't know what to do with my arm.
It feels…

04:12.753 --> 04:15.506
Here. Here we go. This is what we'll do.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.801
We'll go just classic, how you see,
like, in New Yorker cartoons.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.512
Right? Know what?

04:21.595 --> 04:24.598
I'll put this under here
to help even out my spine.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.850
Then-- Yeah, that feels nice. Okay.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.811
Now, what do I do here? Do I just--
No, that's like…

04:31.605 --> 04:34.816
Like I'm going down a water slide
or something like that. Like a luge.

04:35.734 --> 04:38.737
That's a little too "casket-y,"
isn't it? Okay.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.697
How about-- Here, let's do this.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.075
All right, how's this? This good?

04:43.867 --> 04:45.619
Probably sitting is best.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.206
Sure. That's good. Okay.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.041
All right.

04:52.918 --> 04:56.171
Yeah, there we go. There you are.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.300
Quite intimate here, you know?
Close. Close quarters.

05:00.384 --> 05:03.053
It's like we're on a episode
of The Sopranos,

05:03.136 --> 05:06.139
without all the gratuitous violence,
which is a good thing.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.142
But a lot less spaghetti and clams too,
which is a bad thing.

05:09.226 --> 05:10.227
So…

05:10.853 --> 05:14.064
Hey, who's this guy? What's his story?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.984
You good, buddy? Yeah? Okay, good.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.155
Very agreeable fella, you know?
Just doin' his thing.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.075
-You got tissues over there, huh?
-Yes, tissues.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.785
Yeah. What are those for?

05:26.869 --> 05:29.371
Sometimes it gets a bit emotional in here.

05:30.873 --> 05:33.625
-Not always, but sometimes.
-Yep, yep, yep.

05:33.709 --> 05:35.294
Sometimes people just sneeze.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.754
Yeah. Yeah, they do.
Well, we both agree with you.

05:39.464 --> 05:42.384
Yeah. Yeah,
my hay fever's been pretty good over here.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.512
Must be a low pollen count in the UK, so…

05:48.348 --> 05:51.935
Okay. All right. Well, when do we start?

05:52.686 --> 05:53.770
We've already started.

05:54.855 --> 05:58.442
-We started when you entered in here.
-What? Shoot!

05:58.525 --> 06:01.528
Well, I'm sorry. I feel like I've wasted
a bunch of time already,

06:01.612 --> 06:05.282
with all of the couch shenanigans
and noticing your accoutrements.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.909
-It's--
-Ted.

06:06.992 --> 06:07.993
Yeah?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.078
Don't worry.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.583
Yeah. No, of course.
I'm not worried at all.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.667
Yeah.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.171
Okay.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.232
What-- I mean,
what do you wanna talk about?

06:39.274 --> 06:42.152
Why don't you tell me
what happened the other night?

06:42.236 --> 06:43.654
Yeah. I don't wanna do this.

06:59.837 --> 07:02.840
All right, come on! Come here,
come here, come here, come here.

07:02.923 --> 07:03.924
All right, fellas.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.553
Look, there are two things you can't
ever let the other team know, all right?

07:07.636 --> 07:09.763
The first one's your home address.
Mark my words.

07:09.847 --> 07:13.475
You'll start having food deliveries
and SWAT teams showing up 24-7,

07:13.559 --> 07:15.102
which is nuts, 'cause in my day,

07:15.185 --> 07:17.312
all we had to worry about
was crank phone calls.

07:17.396 --> 07:21.233
Then, with the advent of caller ID,
that joy got 86'd from the prank menu,

07:21.316 --> 07:24.444
which is a darn shame, 'cause
the Jerky Boys were a national treasure.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.238
Y'all should give them a google sometime.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.031
But I digress.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.451
The second thing that you don't want your
opponent to know is that you're tired.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.079
Okay, look, I know y'all are exhausted.
I get it.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.789
But I don't want you to show it.

07:35.873 --> 07:38.750
I don't wanna see y'all walking around
with your tired faces, all…

07:42.629 --> 07:45.841
Okay? Just huffing and puffing
around the pitch. Uh-uh. No, thank you.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.676
The only face I wanna see
from y'all is, what, Coach?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.596
-Game face, baby!
-Darn tootin', Vladimir Putin. Right.

07:50.679 --> 07:52.806
-Y'all feel me?
-Yes, Coach!

07:52.890 --> 07:54.683
Good. Okay, good. Now, hop up there.

07:54.766 --> 07:58.395
Okay. Offense, y'all gonna stick
around here with Coach Nate and Beard.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.397
Defense, you're coming with me and Roy.
On the hop.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.690
Move it!

08:04.234 --> 08:06.737
Okay. Right.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.573
Coach Nate, I hope you're not
too great to train us now.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.325
Thank you, Dani. Thank you.

08:11.408 --> 08:13.785
Those drills better be lit.
You've got a reputation to keep up.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.371
Yes, very funny. Thank you, Jamie.

08:16.455 --> 08:19.249
Lucky us. We get to be trained
by the Wonder Kid himself.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.210
Big man.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.671
Very funny, Colin.
You a stand-up comic now?

08:24.755 --> 08:27.799
Kind of ironic, 'cause I sat you down
at the match the other day.

08:29.801 --> 08:33.013
Right. I need all our best goal scorers
on the pitch right now. Go.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.267
Colin, Colin.
You can sit this one out, okay?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.274
I am a strong and capable man.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.443
I am a strong and capable man.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.655
That's my mantra.

08:50.739 --> 08:51.907
Cool.

09:02.584 --> 09:04.378
Bro, it's been two days. Still nothing?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.296
-No.
-Ouch, man.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.924
Sometimes three dots appear,
but then they go away again.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.051
It's over, man. I've messed up.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.137
Don't be negative, amigo. There might be
a good reason she hasn't replied.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.889
Yeah, maybe she got hit by a bus.

09:16.682 --> 09:18.267
Or a train?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.894
It's more likely she lost interest
in the relationship.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.605
Maybe she went back
and saw how lame these texts are.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.899
"My favorite film's Ratatouille."

09:25.983 --> 09:27.609
Hey, listen. Okay.

09:27.693 --> 09:29.862
It doesn't matter.
I don't care if she doesn't--

09:30.571 --> 09:31.613
Three dots. Three dots.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.953
That's a kick in the plums.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.204
Next time, man.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.212
Oh, my God. Just answer him.
It's been two days.

09:47.296 --> 09:49.214
I don't know what to say.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.299
How about the truth?

09:51.550 --> 09:52.551
"I'd love to meet up,

09:52.634 --> 09:56.597
but I'm worried that you can't live up
to the fantasy I've created in my head.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.682
So I'm going to let my insecurities

09:58.765 --> 10:02.186
keep me from possibly finding
my one true love."

10:03.520 --> 10:07.191
His favorite film is Ratatouille.
That's worrying, right?

10:07.274 --> 10:08.859
Meet him.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.320
Who fucking cares
what his favorite movie is?

10:11.403 --> 10:14.031
Also, Ratatouille
is a goddamn masterpiece.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.534
Ironically, it's about snobbery and how
good art can come from anywhere.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.703
Stop your dithering
and go fuck your cartoon rat.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.623
All right. Well, what if we meet up
and it all goes wrong?

10:24.374 --> 10:28.045
I mean, everything always goes wrong.
All relationships are a nightmare.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.132
My relationship is the oxygen
that gives me life.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.844
Apart from Leslie's marriage, which is
a bloody greeting card of some kind.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.849
And you and Roy are just
aggravatingly perfect in every way.

10:41.934 --> 10:42.935
Thank you.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.104
I don't know.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.399
It was definitely easier
when we didn't work together.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.778
I just feel like we're around each other
all the time.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.822
Wherever I go, he's my shadow.
My adorably hairy shadow, but--

11:00.744 --> 11:03.288
What's going on?
Why are you jazz scatting?

11:05.541 --> 11:06.750
Were you talking about me?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.752
-Yeah, we were talking about you.
-No.

11:16.593 --> 11:19.304
-Big whoop. You ready to go?
-Yeah.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.307
Answer him.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.310
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.691
Two, three, four.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.912
-Hello.
-Hello.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.331
-You nearly done?
-God, no.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.750
To-do list's as long as my arm.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.295
What? This arm?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.758
Maybe.

11:57.843 --> 11:59.219
Oi, that's not helping me.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.306
All right. I'll give you your arm back.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.515
Thank you.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.601
I'll take your neck.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.485
Seriously, I have got a lot of work to do.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.863
So if you're gonna be here,
you need to go sit quietly on the couch

12:17.946 --> 12:19.281
and read your book, yeah?

12:22.576 --> 12:23.952
Thank you.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.099
That's not helping me either.

12:46.183 --> 12:50.020
What? I'm doing exactly what you said.
I'm sitting quietly and reading my book.

12:50.103 --> 12:54.316
You doing exactly what I tell you to do
is so fucking hot.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.046
-Hello, Ted.
-What's up, Doc?

13:16.672 --> 13:18.215
I'm surprised you came back.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.925
Yeah, well, I don't quit things.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.563
-How are you, Ted?
-I'm swell, as well as fine and dandy.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.481
-How about you, Doc?
-I'm well.

13:34.565 --> 13:35.566
Glad to hear it.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.528
So, is this your first time doing therapy?

13:39.611 --> 13:43.240
No, ma'am. My wife and I did
couple's therapy for a little while.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.450
How was that?

13:45.534 --> 13:46.827
Well, let's see.

13:47.411 --> 13:50.038
I'm here in London,
and my wife is back in Kansas,

13:50.122 --> 13:53.083
which is a good thing 'cause if she heard
me referring to her as my wife still,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.585
she'd be hopping mad.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.962
How long these little chats you do take?

13:57.045 --> 13:59.381
Sessions typically last 50 minutes.

13:59.464 --> 14:01.925
Okay. But you charge by the hour, right?

14:02.009 --> 14:03.385
That's correct.

14:09.141 --> 14:11.351
I take it you're not a fan
of this kind of work?

14:11.435 --> 14:12.728
No, ma'am.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.104
Why's that, do you think?

14:14.813 --> 14:15.856
You want the truth?

14:15.939 --> 14:18.525
I'm only interested in the truth, Ted.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.154
'Cause I think it's bullshit.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.992
You don't know me. We don't have history.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.036
And yet you just expect me
to spill my guts

14:29.119 --> 14:31.455
about all the gory details of my life.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.875
The fights, the mistakes,
my deep dark secrets.

14:35.501 --> 14:37.920
But you ain't listening
'cause you care about me.

14:38.003 --> 14:42.174
No. No, you're only listening to me
'cause you're paid to listen to me.

14:43.634 --> 14:47.387
You're getting paid to just jot down
your little notes and diagnose my tears.

14:47.471 --> 14:49.932
And then what?
Probably just blame it on my folks, right?

14:50.849 --> 14:53.602
I mean, you say you're only interested
in the truth.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.939
And yet here you are, charging an
hourly rate for only 50 minutes of work.

14:57.022 --> 14:58.273
Like I said, it's bullshit.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.791
-Hey.
-Nathan.

15:20.170 --> 15:21.380
Oh, my God.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.798
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Sam.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.174
Ms. Welton. Hi.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.426
-Call me Rebecca.
-Rebecca. Rebecca, sorry.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.387
These machines, huh?

15:28.470 --> 15:31.265
We've never been so connected,
yet never further apart.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.270
Is that what you were gonna say?

15:37.062 --> 15:39.147
Yes. Yes, it was.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.403
-All right. Have a good day.
-Right. I'll see you later.

15:44.486 --> 15:46.446
-You too. Bye.
-See you, Sam.

15:48.657 --> 15:49.658
Yes.

15:55.539 --> 15:58.542
Hello. Your new pens have arrived.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.260
I'll just leave 'em here.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.344
Yeah, all right.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.180
'Kay.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.556
Sorry. Didn't see you there, Colin.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.640
It's the camouflage.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.270
Nate, wonder if I could have a quick word?

16:18.353 --> 16:19.646
Yeah, go for it.

16:22.399 --> 16:26.069
I just wondered-- Well, I was wondering
if I'd done anything to annoy you.

16:33.702 --> 16:37.331
It's just because I felt like you got
angry at me for taking the piss yesterday,

16:37.414 --> 16:40.709
but Dani and Jamie did the same thing,
and you didn't get mad at them.

16:40.792 --> 16:44.129
Yeah, I can--
Yeah. No, I can explain that.

16:44.213 --> 16:50.552
You see, Jamie and Dani
are like Picasso and Gauguin.

16:50.636 --> 16:51.762
Pedophiles?

16:52.346 --> 16:55.015
Artists. They're artists.

16:55.098 --> 17:00.145
And, Colin, you paint too, but your work
doesn't end up in museums.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.105
It hangs at--

17:03.774 --> 17:06.276
Well, you're like a painting
at a Holiday Inn, you know?

17:06.359 --> 17:10.071
You don't inspire. You don't move people.

17:11.323 --> 17:14.367
You're there. You cover a bloodstain.

17:15.577 --> 17:19.289
You do the job, so… just do the job.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.416
All right?

17:58.579 --> 17:59.663
It's you.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.498
Hi.

18:01.582 --> 18:03.083
Hey, I thought you quit smoking.

18:03.166 --> 18:06.086
What? I have. This is just
covering up the smell of the boots.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.004
That's smart.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.007
Then why you in here?

18:10.591 --> 18:11.800
I just needed some space.

18:15.137 --> 18:16.763
I knew you'd be in here.

18:18.140 --> 18:21.727
This is the room where Keeley
and I decided that smoking doesn't count.

18:25.272 --> 18:26.648
Busted.

18:26.732 --> 18:29.276
-I did also need some space.
-Space from what?

18:29.359 --> 18:31.904
Roy. He's sitting in my office
reading Da Vinci Code.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.115
He keeps muttering on about
the Knights Templar.

18:40.037 --> 18:44.458
Sorry, I just came to the boot room
to get some… boots.

18:46.627 --> 18:47.711
Knock yourself out.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.213
Thank you.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.508
Look, I think Roy is the cat's pajamas.
I do. You know that.

18:52.591 --> 18:55.260
It's just sometimes I need
a moment to myself, you know?

18:55.344 --> 18:58.430
Keeley, stop auditioning your complaints.

18:58.514 --> 19:00.098
Right. Thank you.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.770
Just tell the person
who can actually do something about it.

19:04.853 --> 19:07.689
Well, I don't know, boss.
Sometimes it's good to bottle things up.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.441
That's how we get, you know, pickles.

19:10.025 --> 19:12.277
-And vodka.
-Extra virgin olive oil.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.196
-And messages.
-What?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.448
-In bottles.
-Right.

19:16.532 --> 19:18.784
Oi, Will, do you think you could take
me name off me shirt

19:18.867 --> 19:20.619
and then put it back on but bigger?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.206
The fuck?

19:24.289 --> 19:26.625
-They're talking about Roy.
-What?

19:26.708 --> 19:28.627
-Sorry.
-Grumpy old twat.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.170
I agree with the grumpy part,

19:30.254 --> 19:31.755
but the other two words
I take umbrage with.

19:31.839 --> 19:34.091
Roy is none of those things. He's perfect.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.927
And I should know because I spend
every minute of every second

19:37.010 --> 19:39.096
of every hour of every day
with him, all right?

19:39.179 --> 19:41.640
Right, just tell him that you--

19:43.100 --> 19:44.101
Hi, babe.

19:44.768 --> 19:45.894
You talking about me?

19:45.978 --> 19:48.063
-Yes.
-Definitely.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.108
-Ready to go?
-Yeah.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.027
-Bye.
-Bye.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.322
Adios, muchachos.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.032
-How you doing?
-Hey.

19:59.116 --> 20:01.994
The Knights Templar business
is fucking with my head.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.250
Because your shit is lying around.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.252
You got more shit lying around than I got.

20:10.335 --> 20:14.798
What? Look at this place!
It's loaded with your shit. Just--

20:14.882 --> 20:17.092
Just look at this bathroom!
Look at all your shit…

20:17.176 --> 20:18.177
What's up?

20:18.760 --> 20:20.804
-What's up?
-What's going on?

20:20.888 --> 20:22.472
I'm just watching Sex and the City.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.475
What are you, a crazy bag man?

20:25.559 --> 20:26.768
They're different smells.

20:27.561 --> 20:29.438
Well, enjoy. I'm gonna read.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.606
Cool.

20:32.691 --> 20:35.360
Wait a minute. You use Rogaine?
I didn't know you needed--

20:35.444 --> 20:37.070
It's preventative.

20:37.154 --> 20:39.865
-Is your hair falling out?
-I don't wanna talk about it!

20:39.948 --> 20:43.493
It seems it's not only women
who have secret single behavior.

20:43.577 --> 20:46.246
This is my stuff!
Don't be going through my stuff.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.290
You were more than happy
to go through my stuff.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.250
No way.

20:53.337 --> 20:58.091
I don't ''always do'' anything.
And I have let you in.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.345
You can't put it down
'cause the chapters are so short.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.096
Shut up.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.807
-Shut up?
-Yes. Shut up.

21:05.891 --> 21:07.559
You're telling me to shut up?

21:07.643 --> 21:08.644
Oh, my God.

21:08.727 --> 21:10.437
Please, just shut up!

21:10.521 --> 21:13.106
This geezer wears like a spiked belt
around his thigh--

21:13.190 --> 21:14.358
Fucking hell, Roy!

21:15.567 --> 21:17.486
What? Do you want me to read it to you?

21:17.569 --> 21:20.656
No. I-- No, I just wanna watch my TV show,

21:20.739 --> 21:23.283
and you're rucking ruining it for me!

21:24.785 --> 21:28.288
I just need some time
without you reading or turning me on

21:28.372 --> 21:31.250
or just fucking being there all the time!

21:32.501 --> 21:34.002
You don't want me to turn you on?

21:34.086 --> 21:38.006
No! I-- Yes, I do, sometimes.
Just not all the time.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.051
Sometimes I need to be by myself.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.559
Wait, is this what you've been talking
to everyone about?

21:48.642 --> 21:50.936
Yeah. But you don't care.

21:51.019 --> 21:53.021
I didn't when I thought
it was the usual stuff

21:53.105 --> 21:55.315
like gossip or how much hair
I leave in the drain.

21:56.066 --> 21:57.484
It is a lot of fucking hair.

21:57.568 --> 21:59.695
You've been making out to everyone
like I'm following you around

21:59.778 --> 22:02.823
like a needy,
clingy fucking fridge magnet.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.077
I'm an idiot.

22:07.911 --> 22:09.413
Fuck this!

22:22.926 --> 22:23.927
Shit.

22:28.390 --> 22:31.310
And surprise hero of the week,
assistant coach Nate Shelley

22:31.393 --> 22:34.104
with a heroically ballsy
late-in-the-game strategy

22:34.188 --> 22:35.606
that put Richmond into the semis.

22:35.689 --> 22:36.940
We can all agree,

22:37.024 --> 22:39.860
the Wonder Kid
should be managing his own team.

22:39.943 --> 22:43.488
Savage instincts,
and if I may say, an excellent serve--

22:43.572 --> 22:45.449
God. Wow.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.493
It's you. Sorry.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.704
You were rude to Colin.

22:52.247 --> 22:54.625
Not just rude. It was personal and weird.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.755
No, you're absolutely right…

23:00.589 --> 23:01.590
Did you tell Ted?

23:01.673 --> 23:04.176
No. This is just between me and you.

23:04.259 --> 23:05.427
Okay.

23:05.511 --> 23:06.595
Do better.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.722
The door is behind you.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.559
Yeah.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.562
Wait, this is my--

23:37.626 --> 23:38.669
Hi.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.929
I had porridge for breakfast.
Thanks for asking.

23:49.012 --> 23:51.723
"How was it?"
That's a great follow-up question, babe.

23:52.808 --> 23:54.935
It was too hot and, honestly,
it was too thick,

23:55.018 --> 23:58.313
so burnt my tongue on it
and I almost choked to death.

23:58.397 --> 24:00.023
Not a good morning so far.

24:02.568 --> 24:03.861
Hello, Ted.

24:06.071 --> 24:07.239
I thought you'd be back.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.492
Really? Why's that?

24:10.576 --> 24:11.994
You said you never quit.

24:32.556 --> 24:34.433
Can I be honest with you about something?

24:34.516 --> 24:36.018
What? I got a boogie in my 'stache?

24:38.061 --> 24:39.855
No-- I'm kidding. Sorry, go ahead.

24:39.938 --> 24:43.984
I was quite offended by what you said
about my profession…

24:46.236 --> 24:48.155
that just 'cause
a therapist is being paid,

24:48.238 --> 24:49.698
they don't actually care.

24:50.574 --> 24:52.868
Let me ask you something.
Would you coach for free?

24:53.952 --> 24:55.037
Yeah, I would.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.455
But do you?

24:57.122 --> 24:58.207
No, ma'am.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.375
And yet you care
about your players, right?

25:00.459 --> 25:01.835
Yes, ma'am.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.171
Then why would you assume
it's not the same for me?

25:05.297 --> 25:08.050
I don't assume that
all coaches are macho dickheads.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.095
It's a good point.

25:13.639 --> 25:15.390
Consider me dunked on.

25:17.518 --> 25:20.437
And look,
I'm really sorry about that, you know.

25:20.521 --> 25:23.565
Getting all worked up and saying
stuff like that, then storming outta here.

25:23.649 --> 25:25.150
It happens.

25:25.776 --> 25:27.569
Self-care can be scary.

25:28.570 --> 25:32.407
Fight or flight is a natural response.
You just happened to do both.

25:32.491 --> 25:33.742
Impressive range really.

25:34.451 --> 25:36.745
Yeah, well, watch your back, Glenn Close.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.503
So you think I'm scared, huh?

25:44.586 --> 25:46.088
Yes, I do.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.090
Yeah.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.634
Maybe I don't wanna learn the truth.

25:51.844 --> 25:55.097
Ted, the truth will set you free.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.808
But first, it'll piss you off.

26:01.144 --> 26:03.856
Well, then maybe your new nickname
should be "The Truth."

26:06.108 --> 26:09.152
Well, I can't be your mentor
without occasionally being your tormentor.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.654
I like that.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.030
I knew you would.

26:13.907 --> 26:15.617
Let's get started, shall we?

26:16.410 --> 26:17.411
Yes, ma'am.

26:32.593 --> 26:35.262
That's right, gentlemen.
Big deep breaths while you stretch.

26:35.345 --> 26:37.890
You wanna get that sweet O2
all the way down to your prostate.

26:37.973 --> 26:40.225
And, hey, remember to focus
on the here and now.

26:40.309 --> 26:43.312
Living in the moment, it's a gift.
That's why they call it the present.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.646
Yes.

26:44.730 --> 26:47.357
Okay, before we get started,
Coach Nate, you wanted to say something?

26:47.441 --> 26:49.902
-Yes, please. Thank you, Ted.
-Have at it, Jessica Rabbit.

26:49.985 --> 26:52.404
Yeah. Oi… thank you--

26:53.363 --> 26:55.574
I just wanted, before we started, just to…

26:57.367 --> 26:59.578
well, basically,
I just wanted to make an apology.

27:00.412 --> 27:01.872
Colin,

27:02.372 --> 27:05.709
yesterday I was a bit of a, you know…

27:05.792 --> 27:07.294
-Asshole?
-Prick?

27:07.377 --> 27:08.504
Cock?

27:08.587 --> 27:09.838
Wounded butterfly.

27:11.507 --> 27:14.259
Yes. I was a cocky, prickish,
wounded butterfly's asshole…

27:16.178 --> 27:20.140
but I-- I really am sorry,
and it won't happen again, so…

27:24.269 --> 27:26.271
-It's all good, boyo.
-All right then.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.690
That's good.

27:28.774 --> 27:30.150
-All right.
-Come here.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.820
-Okay.
-Did I miss something?

27:34.488 --> 27:36.365
Okay. Yeah. All right.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.075
Anything I need to address?

27:40.494 --> 27:42.788
Well, like I always say,
sometimes the best stew

27:42.871 --> 27:44.915
is the one you leave
sitting on the stove overnight

27:44.998 --> 27:47.251
'cause you fell asleep watching
Citizen Kane after too many beers.

27:47.334 --> 27:48.502
I know, Colin. I know.

27:49.127 --> 27:52.172
All right, fellas! Hey!
So here's the plan today.

27:52.256 --> 27:53.757
Peas and carrots,
you're going with Coach Roy.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.718
Rest of you beef chunks are coming
with me. Let's go to work.

27:59.054 --> 28:00.264
What?

28:01.890 --> 28:03.767
Starters with Roy, reserves with Coach.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.102
Right.

28:05.185 --> 28:07.229
Just say that then.
Do you know what I mean?

28:08.272 --> 28:10.065
Here Richard, Richard! Richard!

28:14.444 --> 28:15.696
Whistle!

28:17.114 --> 28:18.615
Oi! I said, "Whistle!"

28:18.699 --> 28:21.326
Roy, why don't you just use
an actual whistle?

28:21.410 --> 28:24.413
I told you, my lips are sensitive
to impure metals

28:24.496 --> 28:26.248
and whistles give me mouth hives.

28:26.331 --> 28:29.501
Jamie, what the fuck were you doing?

28:29.585 --> 28:33.547
Richard loses his man, gets into the box,
and you run the other way?

28:34.298 --> 28:36.300
I was pulling my defender out of his path.

28:36.383 --> 28:37.551
He's your teammate.

28:37.634 --> 28:40.304
He needs you to come to the ball
and support him.

28:40.387 --> 28:41.638
You all got that?

28:43.974 --> 28:47.769
Respectfully, Coach,
that ain't what he needs from me.

28:47.853 --> 28:50.314
He needs me to give him space.

28:52.858 --> 28:53.901
What'd you say?

28:56.862 --> 29:00.115
The best thing I can do
in that situation is give him space.

29:00.199 --> 29:01.617
He's right, actually.

29:01.700 --> 29:03.911
-Yeah, I know. I learned it from Pep.
-He got it from "Cruijff".

29:03.994 --> 29:05.621
-Pronounced "Cruyff."
-Okay, Englishman.

29:05.704 --> 29:09.082
Look, whatever. The point is that
Richard doesn't need me to crowd him.

29:09.166 --> 29:10.292
And since he's me teammate,

29:10.375 --> 29:13.420
I should trust him
to do what's best, right?

29:24.932 --> 29:26.141
Fuck!

29:31.688 --> 29:33.565
I didn't say nothing bad this time.

29:35.651 --> 29:36.985
There he is, there he is!

29:39.404 --> 29:41.281
Coach Nate, we have a gift for you.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.117
Yeah. Good thing you apologized,
otherwise this would be awkward.

29:49.248 --> 29:50.499
"Wonder Kid."

29:50.582 --> 29:53.001
I mean, because of you saying that
instead of "wunderkind,"

29:53.085 --> 29:54.545
which is the proper pronunciation.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.422
-Wow.
-It was Will's idea.

29:57.506 --> 29:58.841
Hey.

29:58.924 --> 30:00.300
Was it?

30:00.384 --> 30:03.178
Well, you know, it's a pretty
awesome nickname, so cheers.

30:03.262 --> 30:04.763
Cheers.

30:04.847 --> 30:08.517
No, thank you.
I mean, I did say wunderkind, but…

30:09.601 --> 30:11.270
But, Will, this is great.
It's really funny.

30:11.353 --> 30:12.896
-It's good, man.
-Thank you.

30:14.648 --> 30:15.649
Thank you.

30:20.237 --> 30:23.407
"If music be the food of love, play on.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.033
Give me excess of it."

30:25.701 --> 30:28.537
If that's your fancy way of asking
if I want another one, you guessed right.

30:28.620 --> 30:29.621
Thought so.

30:29.705 --> 30:32.040
Bear with me.
I'll be out in two seconds. Cheers.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.335
Of all the pub joints.

30:36.295 --> 30:39.131
Trent Crimm of the Independent.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

30:39.214 --> 30:41.550
I was just having a bite to eat, you know?

30:41.633 --> 30:45.512
But as we're here,
I would love to get an official statement

30:45.596 --> 30:47.931
about your early departure
from the Spurs match.

30:49.683 --> 30:50.851
An official statement?

30:51.768 --> 30:53.687
Well, I thought folks knew
I had food poisoning.

30:54.897 --> 30:55.856
Not from here.

30:58.483 --> 31:03.071
Yeah, yeah. They do. But I'd love
a personal quote, if possible.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.741
Okay, well, I had food poisoning.

31:06.325 --> 31:08.160
And because I respect
your readers so much,

31:08.243 --> 31:11.330
I'll leave out all the specific nastiness
that occurred.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.248
-Yeah.
-But I'm fit as a fiddle now.

31:13.332 --> 31:17.503
So you had food poisoning
and you are fit as a fiddle now…

31:19.713 --> 31:21.882
Exactamundo, Dikembe Mutombo.

31:23.467 --> 31:24.885
Love our chats.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.763
Thank you, Mae.

31:27.846 --> 31:29.389
My pleasure, darling.

31:49.576 --> 31:50.827
Shit.

31:54.248 --> 31:55.415
Roy?

32:03.549 --> 32:04.550
Hi.

32:05.467 --> 32:06.510
Hi.

32:08.720 --> 32:09.847
Are you leaving?

32:10.806 --> 32:11.890
What?

32:12.850 --> 32:13.976
No.

32:24.862 --> 32:25.863
Hey, Siri.

32:26.655 --> 32:29.992
Play the "Roy is sorry
for not understanding Keeley" playlist.

32:33.871 --> 32:36.164
I stole those roses
from your neighbor's garden.

32:36.248 --> 32:37.958
Ripped them to shreds.

32:38.917 --> 32:39.877
And that…

32:41.170 --> 32:44.590
that's Phoebe's light,
so I'm gonna have to give that back

32:44.673 --> 32:46.216
or I'm gonna get it in the neck.

32:49.511 --> 32:52.848
And that, that's a foot scrubber
or something.

32:53.348 --> 32:55.893
The woman said it's good
if you've got gross feet.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.812
What? You think I've got gross feet?

32:58.896 --> 33:03.734
Babe, I think you're the cat's pajamas,
but your feet are a fucking state.

33:07.571 --> 33:09.239
But who am I to judge?

33:09.323 --> 33:11.825
I found so much of my hair down the drain,

33:12.409 --> 33:16.788
it looked like a rat had got trapped
and fucking drowned.

33:26.924 --> 33:27.925
Oh, my God.

33:33.847 --> 33:39.603
Now, you are not gonna see or hear me
for at least three hours.

33:48.612 --> 33:49.613
Thank you.

34:48.797 --> 34:51.382
If you ever do anything
to humiliate me again,

34:51.466 --> 34:53.177
I'll make your life a fucking misery.
