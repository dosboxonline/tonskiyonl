00:36.305 --> 00:37.973
Welcome back to the program.

00:38.015 --> 00:40.017
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

00:40.059 --> 00:42.686
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

00:42.728 --> 00:44.855
Which occurred exactly one year ago today.

00:45.814 --> 00:47.292
I've worked on this show for many years

00:47.316 --> 00:48.835
and I've never sat across from someone.

00:48.859 --> 00:50.861
Who has a story to tell quite like yours.

00:51.945 --> 00:53.173
Thank you again for taking the time.

00:53.197 --> 00:54.740
To sit down and speak with me.

00:54.782 --> 00:56.241
It's my pleasure.

00:57.576 --> 00:58.970
Now when we left off we were talking.

00:58.994 --> 01:01.580
About the moment you
woke up from the coma.

01:01.622 --> 01:03.099
Do you remember your initial reaction.

01:03.123 --> 01:04.833
When you first saw your face?

01:04.875 --> 01:06.377
Yes.

01:06.418 --> 01:08.462
Would you like to share that with us?

01:09.922 --> 01:11.006
I wished I was dead.

01:12.424 --> 01:14.635
Do you still feel that way?

01:14.676 --> 01:17.137
People are frightened
by the way that I look,

01:17.179 --> 01:18.263
especially children.

01:19.306 --> 01:22.684
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

01:22.726 --> 01:24.228
So isolation is ideal.

01:26.814 --> 01:28.399
Now what about your attacker,

01:29.400 --> 01:32.611
A man identified only as Art the Clown?

01:32.653 --> 01:36.198
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

01:36.240 --> 01:37.592
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

01:37.616 --> 01:39.886
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office.

01:39.910 --> 01:41.328
The morning after the attack.

01:41.370 --> 01:42.621
He's dead.

01:42.663 --> 01:44.331
I saw it happen.

03:11.376 --> 03:13.003
Did you watch it?

03:13.045 --> 03:15.339
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

03:20.219 --> 03:22.095
My heart was pounding the entire time.

03:23.597 --> 03:25.783
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

03:25.807 --> 03:29.019
Imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

03:29.061 --> 03:31.688
I thought I was going to gag at one point.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.232
Babe, do me a favor.

03:33.273 --> 03:34.626
If I ever look like that, promise me.

03:34.650 --> 03:36.151
You'll put me out of my misery.

03:37.152 --> 03:38.487
You think I'm kidding?

03:38.529 --> 03:39.571
I'll do it myself.

03:41.323 --> 03:43.163
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

03:43.200 --> 03:45.320
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.585
Exactly.

03:53.627 --> 03:56.213
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

03:56.255 --> 03:58.966
Faceless victims and a host in jeopardy.

03:59.841 --> 04:00.759
Yeah, watch next month, it's going.

04:00.801 --> 04:02.719
To be called Monica's House of Horrors.

04:04.805 --> 04:05.597
Shit.

04:05.639 --> 04:06.640
Hey, can I call you back?

04:06.682 --> 04:09.101
I have like 50 people calling me.

04:09.142 --> 04:10.060
Okay-

04:10.102 --> 04:11.520
Alright, love you too.

04:11.562 --> 04:12.562
Bye.

04:14.273 --> 04:15.273
Hello?

04:16.483 --> 04:17.858
Tom?

05:18.545 --> 05:20.255
I think I just twisted my ankle.

05:20.297 --> 05:21.297
Dawn, really?

05:22.007 --> 05:23.383
Thanks a lot, by the way.

05:23.425 --> 05:24.217
For what?

05:24.259 --> 05:27.095
Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

05:27.137 --> 05:28.555
Guys kept buying me drinks.

05:28.597 --> 05:31.433
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

05:31.475 --> 05:32.267
Yeah.

05:32.309 --> 05:34.895
Definitely your mind that they were after.

05:34.936 --> 05:36.021
Who are you texting?

05:36.063 --> 05:36.855
None of your business.

05:36.897 --> 05:39.066
You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

05:39.107 --> 05:41.652
Oh my god, you're so jealous.

05:41.693 --> 05:42.486
Of what?

05:42.527 --> 05:43.921
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

05:43.945 --> 05:45.280
Oh, stop being such a bitch.

05:45.322 --> 05:46.365
Just get in the car.

05:46.406 --> 05:48.367
Oh, you are not driving.

05:48.408 --> 05:49.701
I'm fine.

05:49.743 --> 05:50.911
Give me the keys.

05:50.952 --> 05:52.412
Give me the keys.

05:52.454 --> 05:54.247
Dawn, I don't feel like dying tonight.

05:54.289 --> 05:55.290
' Really?

05:55.332 --> 05:56.958
Are we really gonna do this right now?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.960
Give me the keys.

05:59.002 --> 06:01.380
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

06:01.421 --> 06:02.214
Give me what I want.

06:02.255 --> 06:04.174
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

06:04.216 --> 06:05.842
You drive.

06:05.884 --> 06:09.304
Thank you.

06:15.352 --> 06:16.603
I'm fucking lit.

06:17.479 --> 06:20.565
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

06:20.607 --> 06:22.776
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

06:22.818 --> 06:24.194
Did you say food?

06:24.236 --> 06:25.529
I said food.

06:25.570 --> 06:27.006
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

06:27.030 --> 06:28.031
Okay, okay, Okay-

06:28.073 --> 06:30.784
Just like give me one minute.

06:30.826 --> 06:31.952
Fuck me.

06:31.993 --> 06:33.912
Like one minute, for real.

06:39.376 --> 06:40.376
D.

06:43.296 --> 06:44.089
(E)-

06:44.131 --> 06:44.965
What?

06:45.006 --> 06:46.133
Look.

06:47.843 --> 06:48.969
Holy shit.

06:49.010 --> 06:49.970
Yeah, that's not funny.

06:50.011 --> 06:51.555
I'm about to scream.

06:51.596 --> 06:52.973
Hey, handsome.

06:53.014 --> 06:53.807
Dawn, cut it out.

06:53.849 --> 06:55.142
My friend wants your number.

06:55.183 --> 06:57.102
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

06:57.144 --> 06:57.936
Come buy us dinner.

06:57.978 --> 06:58.770
Stop-

06:58.812 --> 07:00.105
Just shut the fuck up.

07:00.147 --> 07:00.939
Or what?

07:00.981 --> 07:02.774
Maybe he'll drive us home.

07:02.816 --> 07:04.484
I'm sorry, she's drunk.

07:13.160 --> 07:14.411
Let's go.

07:14.453 --> 07:15.287
Come on.

07:15.328 --> 07:16.872
Let's just go.

07:23.170 --> 07:23.962
Oh yeah?

07:24.004 --> 07:25.004
You get dressed up?

07:25.922 --> 07:27.758
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

07:27.799 --> 07:28.592
Where am I gonna go?

07:28.633 --> 07:29.926
Back to my wife?

07:29.968 --> 07:30.968
Same shit.

07:31.887 --> 07:33.638
Maybe another two hours?

07:33.680 --> 07:34.806
Alright.

07:34.848 --> 07:35.891
Alright, bye-

07:43.315 --> 07:44.608
- Great.

07:46.610 --> 07:48.236
Ugh.

07:48.278 --> 07:52.449
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

07:52.491 --> 07:54.242
Thank you for sharing that.

07:55.076 --> 07:58.246
This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

07:58.288 --> 07:59.080
What a shocker.

07:59.122 --> 08:00.415
I told him I would.

08:00.457 --> 08:01.416
What?

08:01.458 --> 08:02.458
I'm kidding.

08:03.627 --> 08:05.796
I have a little more
self respect than that.

08:05.837 --> 08:07.422
If you only had a brain.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.010
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

08:12.052 --> 08:13.720
Congratulations.

08:29.778 --> 08:31.071
Look it's your boyfriend.

08:32.239 --> 08:34.573
I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

08:34.616 --> 08:36.243
I don't know, six weeks from now.

08:37.953 --> 08:39.371
I'll be right with you buddy.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.515
You gotta see the shape of this fuckin'

08:41.539 --> 08:42.666
guy that just walked in.

09:10.986 --> 09:12.028
' Are you okay?

09:18.159 --> 09:20.453
I think we should get our food to go.

09:20.495 --> 09:21.495
Why?

09:25.125 --> 09:26.125
Him?

09:26.918 --> 09:28.253
Seriously, I wanna leave.

09:29.713 --> 09:30.714
Jesus Christ.

09:32.215 --> 09:33.008
D, stop-

09:33.049 --> 09:34.049
- Uh, excuse me?

09:35.051 --> 09:35.844
Excuse me?

09:35.886 --> 09:37.554
Can I get a picture with you?

09:37.596 --> 09:38.388
Dawn, come on.

09:38.430 --> 09:39.430
Shut up.

09:41.516 --> 09:42.516
Hello?

09:45.020 --> 09:46.020
Hello?

09:47.564 --> 09:48.356
Okay-

09:48.398 --> 09:50.775
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

09:54.946 --> 09:56.281
Oh.

09:56.323 --> 09:57.824
Oh.

09:57.866 --> 09:58.866
Sorry.

10:16.843 --> 10:17.843
Thanks.

10:20.889 --> 10:22.432
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:22.474 --> 10:23.266
What?

10:23.308 --> 10:24.100
Did you think he was gonna hack me up

10:24.142 --> 10:25.422
into little pieces or something?

10:26.478 --> 10:27.896
What can I get for you buddy?

10:30.065 --> 10:31.065
Hey?

10:31.816 --> 10:32.816
Hello?

10:35.820 --> 10:38.573
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

10:40.075 --> 10:42.202
You already have eight likes.

10:44.454 --> 10:45.997
Can you hear me in there?

10:47.874 --> 10:50.752
Oh god, it's gonna be a long night.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.160
Aww.

11:31.710 --> 11:32.710
What are you doing?

11:38.591 --> 11:39.591
Thanks.

11:47.267 --> 11:49.894
Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing.

11:49.936 --> 11:52.022
A guy's done for you all night.

11:52.063 --> 11:53.440
Seriously?

11:53.481 --> 11:54.357
What the fuck?

11:54.399 --> 11:55.483
Here you go ladies.

11:57.485 --> 11:58.278
Yes.

11:58.319 --> 11:59.487
You two okay?

11:59.529 --> 12:00.655
Oh, he's harmless.

12:01.614 --> 12:02.614
You okay?

12:03.867 --> 12:05.452
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

12:05.493 --> 12:06.493
Enjoy your pizza.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.846
What do you keep staring at?

12:24.888 --> 12:26.014
That bag.

12:26.056 --> 12:27.390
What do you think is in it?

12:29.893 --> 12:31.102
I don't know, who cares?

12:31.144 --> 12:32.144
Just eat your food.

12:35.523 --> 12:37.567
You fuckin' freak!

12:37.609 --> 12:38.401
Get over here.

12:38.443 --> 12:40.779
All night with you, you fuck.

12:40.820 --> 12:41.820
Enough.

12:45.325 --> 12:47.118
Get outta here.

12:51.206 --> 12:54.167
Take your shit, and don't come back.

12:58.963 --> 13:00.632
Ramon, grab a mob and some bleach.

13:00.673 --> 13:01.466
Eh, you okay?

13:01.508 --> 13:02.759
Yeah, I'm alright.

13:17.273 --> 13:19.317
What do you think
that guy did in there?

13:19.359 --> 13:20.693
Who knows.

13:20.735 --> 13:22.570
Probably jizzed
all over the place,

13:22.612 --> 13:23.530
fucking pervert.

13:23.571 --> 13:25.448
' Stop.

13:25.490 --> 13:26.282
What?

13:26.324 --> 13:28.427
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

13:28.451 --> 13:30.411
He was obviously turned on by you.

13:30.453 --> 13:31.830
You're fuckin' sick.

13:31.871 --> 13:32.871
You know that?

13:35.583 --> 13:36.709
What?

13:36.751 --> 13:40.130
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

13:40.171 --> 13:41.690
Look, at least he had the courtesy to do.

13:41.714 --> 13:43.007
Whatever he did in private.

13:43.049 --> 13:46.427
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

13:46.469 --> 13:48.304
I really don't need the visual.

13:51.141 --> 13:52.976
Well are you okay to drive?

13:53.017 --> 13:55.562
Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

13:56.813 --> 13:58.231
- Oh my god.
- What?

13:58.273 --> 13:59.273
Your tire.

14:00.024 --> 14:01.024
Fuck me.

14:02.152 --> 14:04.362
Has it been like this the whole time?

14:04.404 --> 14:05.840
I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed.

14:05.864 --> 14:07.615
That your tire had exploded.

14:07.657 --> 14:10.118
Why does this shit always happen to me?

14:10.160 --> 14:11.494
Do you have a spare?

14:12.662 --> 14:13.663
It's on the car.

14:14.831 --> 14:15.831
Wow.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.878
I'm starting to feel sick.

14:19.919 --> 14:22.046
Just, give me your phone.

14:22.088 --> 14:23.088
I'll call my sister.

14:27.427 --> 14:29.596
Yo Steve, this is sick.

14:29.637 --> 14:32.265
I better get overtime for this.

14:32.307 --> 14:34.142
No joke, this is disgusting.

14:34.184 --> 14:35.995
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock.

14:36.019 --> 14:37.562
In the morning.

14:37.604 --> 14:39.206
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

14:39.230 --> 14:40.773
Real fuckin' sanitary.

14:41.816 --> 14:44.110
Steve, time and a half, or I'm out.

14:46.738 --> 14:47.738
You hear me?

14:58.416 --> 14:59.250
Hello?

14:59.292 --> 15:00.335
Hi, it's me.

15:01.711 --> 15:02.670
Tara?

15:02.712 --> 15:03.880
Yeah, my phone died.

15:03.922 --> 15:05.757
I'm calling from Dawn's.

15:05.798 --> 15:06.549
Ah.

15:06.591 --> 15:07.383
Your phone died.

15:07.425 --> 15:08.986
Can you ever go out
without using social media.

15:09.010 --> 15:10.803
Every 30 seconds?

15:10.845 --> 15:12.472
I think you're the only one in America.

15:12.513 --> 15:14.224
Who has that sort of restraint.

15:14.265 --> 15:15.934
Yeah, that's probably right.

15:15.975 --> 15:17.185
Did I wake you?

15:17.227 --> 15:20.438
No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

15:20.480 --> 15:21.731
Oh, shit.

15:21.773 --> 15:25.902
Why, what is it?

15:26.569 --> 15:27.904
What is it, Tara?

15:27.946 --> 15:30.156
Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

15:30.198 --> 15:31.908
She has a flat tire and no spare.

15:31.950 --> 15:34.452
And I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

15:35.954 --> 15:38.456
I have to be up in five hours, Tara.

15:38.498 --> 15:39.499
Yeah, I know Vic.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.042
Don't bother, seriously.

15:41.084 --> 15:42.669
I didn't realize you had a test.

15:48.132 --> 15:49.132
Sorry.

15:50.343 --> 15:52.637
I didn't know you were here.

16:00.645 --> 16:01.771
You know what?

16:01.813 --> 16:03.582
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

16:03.606 --> 16:05.191
I can always blame you.

16:05.233 --> 16:07.527
You are the best sister in the world.

16:09.821 --> 16:10.821
Yeah.

16:12.740 --> 16:13.740
Where are you?

16:25.878 --> 16:26.879
What's wrong?

16:28.631 --> 16:29.632
I'm fine.

16:29.674 --> 16:31.009
Why?

16:31.050 --> 16:34.178
You keep looking over your shoulder.

16:35.305 --> 16:37.140
Just thinking.

16:37.181 --> 16:38.181
About?

16:39.392 --> 16:40.392
Nothing.

16:41.311 --> 16:42.311
Tell me.

16:45.189 --> 16:47.150
What if that guy did this to your car?

16:48.443 --> 16:49.235
What guy?

16:49.277 --> 16:50.111
The clown?

16:50.153 --> 16:51.154
I'm serious.

16:53.031 --> 16:55.908
Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

16:56.868 --> 16:59.495
Well, he knows this is your car.

16:59.537 --> 17:01.372
He saw us getting into it earlier.

17:01.414 --> 17:02.915
That's fucking ridiculous.

17:02.957 --> 17:05.542
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

17:07.627 --> 17:08.981
I should have just let you drive.

17:09.005 --> 17:12.008
Yeah, you should have.

17:12.050 --> 17:15.011
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

17:15.053 --> 17:16.137
so here we are.

17:16.179 --> 17:17.221
Stuck.

17:17.262 --> 17:19.057
Like a couple of assholes.

17:32.528 --> 17:33.528
Steve!

17:54.425 --> 17:55.425
Oh fuck!

18:04.644 --> 18:05.561
Help!

18:05.603 --> 18:09.816
Somebody!

18:25.248 --> 18:28.042
Yeah, but what if I'm right,

18:28.084 --> 18:30.837
And he's out there watching us right now?

18:32.171 --> 18:34.340
Show him your tits.

18:34.382 --> 18:36.384
I don't know, Tara.

18:36.426 --> 18:38.386
Look, that guy was harmless.

18:38.428 --> 18:41.764
He's just some douchebag in a costume.

18:41.806 --> 18:44.684
Acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

18:49.105 --> 18:50.064
No.

18:50.106 --> 18:51.106
He was different.

18:54.318 --> 18:55.194
He smiled.

18:55.236 --> 18:58.072
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

19:00.783 --> 19:02.326
What was in that bag?

19:05.997 --> 19:07.540
I don't know, Tara.

19:07.582 --> 19:09.792
The point is, he's gone,

19:09.834 --> 19:11.377
And you're never gonna see him again.

19:11.419 --> 19:15.548
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

19:31.272 --> 19:32.857
I really have to pee.

19:32.899 --> 19:33.899
So go.

19:34.734 --> 19:36.194
_ Go?

19:36.235 --> 19:37.028
Go where?

19:37.069 --> 19:38.446
It's the middle of the night.

19:38.488 --> 19:40.781
I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street.

19:40.823 --> 19:42.033
And pee like you do.

19:42.074 --> 19:44.202
Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while.

19:44.243 --> 19:46.454
Before your sister gets here.

19:46.496 --> 19:47.496
Fuck.

19:59.383 --> 20:01.969
Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

20:02.011 --> 20:03.221
_ who?

20:03.262 --> 20:05.765
That creepy guy who just got out of that.

20:05.806 --> 20:07.808
Even creepier looking building.

20:09.519 --> 20:10.645
Tara.

20:10.686 --> 20:11.979
I was kidding.

20:13.272 --> 20:14.272
Excuse me?

20:15.358 --> 20:16.150
_ Yes?

20:16.192 --> 20:16.984
I'm sorry to bother you.

20:17.026 --> 20:19.403
Is there a bathroom in there I could use?

20:19.445 --> 20:20.905
Sorry, I don't own the place.

20:20.947 --> 20:22.424
I'm not supposed to let anyone in here.

20:22.448 --> 20:24.158
Please, mister, it's an emergency.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.493
I'll be two seconds.

20:25.535 --> 20:27.828
Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

20:27.870 --> 20:28.871
Who's gonna know?

20:28.913 --> 20:31.832
Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

20:31.874 --> 20:33.584
She'll make it worth your while.

20:35.378 --> 20:36.629
A friend of yours?

20:36.671 --> 20:39.006
Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

20:40.174 --> 20:42.843
It's been a long night.

20:42.885 --> 20:43.844
Alright.

20:43.886 --> 20:45.388
Just make it quick, okay?

20:45.429 --> 20:46.429
Thank you.

20:48.683 --> 20:51.227
Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

20:56.816 --> 20:57.816
This way.

21:01.362 --> 21:02.506
Good thing you called me when I did.

21:02.530 --> 21:05.032
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

21:05.074 --> 21:05.908
Bomb?

21:05.950 --> 21:07.034
Bug bomb.

21:07.076 --> 21:08.076
Pest control.

21:08.828 --> 21:09.912
What kind of pest?

21:09.954 --> 21:11.348
You sure you want me to tell you before

21:11.372 --> 21:12.540
you use the bathroom?

21:12.582 --> 21:13.374
Why?

21:13.416 --> 21:14.584
Don't tell me it's roaches.

21:14.625 --> 21:15.585
It's not roaches.

21:15.626 --> 21:16.419
Oh good.

21:16.460 --> 21:17.460
It's rats.

21:18.671 --> 21:19.671
Rats?

21:22.925 --> 21:23.925
All clear.

21:24.885 --> 21:25.678
Are you sure?

21:25.720 --> 21:26.887
Rat free.

21:26.929 --> 21:29.599
What if one crawls out of the toilet?

21:29.640 --> 21:32.143
I'd make it quick if I were you.

21:32.184 --> 21:33.184
Good plan.

21:35.479 --> 21:37.607
Do you need me to wait for you or?

21:37.648 --> 21:39.108
I'll be alright.

21:39.150 --> 21:41.569
You remember how we came in?

21:41.611 --> 21:42.611
I remember.

21:43.946 --> 21:44.822
_ Okay-

21:44.864 --> 21:47.742
Well, um, you have a nice night then.

21:47.783 --> 21:49.160
You too.

21:49.201 --> 21:50.201
Thanks again.

21:51.245 --> 21:52.245
Don't mention it.

22:28.407 --> 22:30.034
Craven's Halloween Super Store,

22:30.076 --> 22:32.328
the brand new Halloween
super store with over

22:32.370 --> 22:35.289
10,000 square feet of
costumes, accessories,

22:35.331 --> 22:36.582
And decorations.

22:36.624 --> 22:39.126
Miles County's largest Halloween store.

22:39.168 --> 22:41.504
Kid's costumes, adult costumes,

22:41.545 --> 22:43.339
Wigs, hats, and masks.

22:43.381 --> 22:45.591
Makeup, and so much more.

22:45.633 --> 22:48.844
So come in and check
out our huge selection.

22:48.886 --> 22:50.429
Located at Roma Boulevard.

22:52.348 --> 22:55.184
This is
a WNEW breaking news alert.

22:55.226 --> 22:57.895
We have a major development
in Miles County this evening,

22:57.937 --> 23:00.690
Where authorities are
investigating a double homicide.

23:00.731 --> 23:02.983
Two employees at the Deer Hill's Pizzeria.

23:03.025 --> 23:06.278
Were found brutally
murdered just moments ago.

23:06.320 --> 23:07.863
No suspects are in custody yet

23:07.905 --> 23:09.156
but police are on the look out

23:09.198 --> 23:11.534
for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white.

23:11.575 --> 23:15.121
Clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

23:15.162 --> 23:15.955
No way.

23:15.996 --> 23:17.265
An
Eyewitness spotted the suspect.

23:17.289 --> 23:19.291
After hearing multiple screams.

23:19.333 --> 23:21.377
No further details at this moment.

23:21.419 --> 23:23.337
Stay tuned, and we'll
continue to bring you.

23:23.379 --> 23:25.715
More breaking updates as
they become available.

23:38.477 --> 23:39.311
Oh my god, you're
never gonna believe what

23:39.353 --> 23:41.147
I just heard on the radio.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.895
Figures.

25:14.824 --> 25:16.075
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:16.116 --> 25:17.116
Shh.

25:18.452 --> 25:20.079
You don't have to say a word.

25:21.330 --> 25:22.748
Your eyes tell me everything.

25:26.043 --> 25:28.712
I didn't mean to frighten you, dear.

25:28.754 --> 25:31.048
You must be the new tenant.

25:31.090 --> 25:33.008
It's nice to finally meet you.

25:34.760 --> 25:37.721
You're really going to like it here.

25:38.639 --> 25:39.974
Isn't she, Emily?

25:40.891 --> 25:43.310
This is my daughter, Emily.

25:43.352 --> 25:45.729
Say hello to the pretty young lady.

25:52.361 --> 25:55.656
It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

25:55.698 --> 25:58.409
Perhaps we can do our laundry together.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.327
I could use some good company.

26:01.996 --> 26:03.205
Yes.

26:03.247 --> 26:04.665
That sounds like a good idea.

26:07.626 --> 26:09.420
Will you excuse me a moment?

26:09.461 --> 26:11.255
I have to find the landlord.

26:11.297 --> 26:14.842
The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

26:17.469 --> 26:20.848
Punctuality is the thief of time, dear.

30:37.271 --> 30:38.105
' Help!

30:38.147 --> 30:39.147
Somebody!

30:40.149 --> 30:41.149
Please!

32:03.899 --> 32:06.151
Happy Halloween boys and ghouls.

32:06.193 --> 32:08.862
The current temperature
is a crisp 43 degrees.

32:08.904 --> 32:10.584
The winds are starting to pick up as well,

32:10.614 --> 32:12.741
Setting the tone for old Samhain.

32:12.783 --> 32:14.701
Now if you're still out and about in

32:14.743 --> 32:17.746
the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

32:17.788 --> 32:18.580
out there.

32:18.622 --> 32:19.849
Police are still on the look out

32:19.873 --> 32:21.750
for a man involved in a brutal slaying.

32:21.792 --> 32:24.836
Of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

32:24.878 --> 32:26.672
The suspect was last seen wearing

32:26.713 --> 32:28.465
a black and white clown costume.

32:28.507 --> 32:30.259
With matching face paint.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.761
If you're just tuning in, this is not

32:32.803 --> 32:33.845
a Halloween prank.

32:33.887 --> 32:36.223
The local sheriff has advised all persons

32:36.265 --> 32:38.475
in the Miles County Area to stay indoors

32:38.517 --> 32:40.727
and notify authorities if they see anyone.

32:40.769 --> 32:43.105
Matching the assailant's description.

32:43.146 --> 32:44.146
' Really?

33:54.551 --> 33:55.551
Mister!

33:56.762 --> 33:58.055
Help me, please.

33:59.514 --> 34:00.807
Help me, please.

34:05.937 --> 34:07.439
Mister!

40:54.262 --> 40:56.055
Come on, motherfucker!

40:58.641 --> 40:59.641
Come on!

41:06.858 --> 41:07.858
Get up!

41:10.236 --> 41:11.529
Get the fuck up!

41:16.493 --> 41:17.493
Get up!

41:51.236 --> 41:52.236
Shh.

41:53.738 --> 41:54.739
It's alright, mommy.

41:56.157 --> 41:58.368
It's only the wind.

41:58.409 --> 42:00.662
It can't hurt you.

42:00.703 --> 42:02.163
I won't let anything hurt you.

42:38.741 --> 42:40.577
I guess the new neighbors weren't such.

42:40.618 --> 42:42.495
A good idea after all.

46:57.834 --> 46:59.335
Jesus Christ.

46:59.377 --> 47:01.087
Can you help me, please?

47:01.129 --> 47:03.047
Who are you? How the
hell did you get in here?

47:03.089 --> 47:04.882
You have to come with me now.

47:04.924 --> 47:06.801
There's a dead woman in your basement.

47:06.843 --> 47:07.635
What?

47:07.677 --> 47:08.469
Yes.

47:08.511 --> 47:09.303
Dead.

47:09.345 --> 47:10.138
Dead, all dead.

47:10.179 --> 47:13.432
He's killing them one by
one by one, like cows.

47:13.474 --> 47:15.143
Look, lady.

47:15.184 --> 47:15.977
Lady.

47:16.018 --> 47:18.163
If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

47:18.187 --> 47:19.540
Yes, that's what I've been saying.

47:19.564 --> 47:21.440
You need to call the
police right away because

47:21.482 --> 47:23.043
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

47:23.067 --> 47:24.861
to kill you, too, if
you don't get somebody

47:24.902 --> 47:25.778
down here right away.

47:25.820 --> 47:27.047
What the fuck are you talking about?

47:27.071 --> 47:28.257
The clown with the
white face and the little

47:28.281 --> 47:29.073
black hat.

47:29.115 --> 47:31.409
He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

47:31.450 --> 47:34.203
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

47:34.245 --> 47:35.746
Get the hell away from me.

47:35.788 --> 47:36.914
I'm telling you.

47:36.956 --> 47:40.084
He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me.

47:40.126 --> 47:41.586
Before he kills you.

47:41.627 --> 47:43.045
Don't touch me.

47:43.087 --> 47:43.838
Don't!

47:43.880 --> 47:45.214
Help me, please, help me.

47:45.256 --> 47:46.799
I said, get the hell away from me!

47:55.391 --> 47:57.685
Emily.

48:04.317 --> 48:05.860
Hello?

48:07.320 --> 48:08.320
Is anybody in here?

48:09.405 --> 48:12.116
What The fuck is going on here?

48:31.302 --> 48:33.054
' Wow.

48:33.095 --> 48:35.598
Yeah, this better be good, man.

48:35.640 --> 48:36.432
What happened?

48:36.474 --> 48:37.474
You burn the place down?

48:38.935 --> 48:39.935
Hello?

48:41.395 --> 48:42.395
Mike?

48:44.106 --> 48:45.483
Wow, you flipped out?

48:45.524 --> 48:46.524
Hello?

48:47.318 --> 48:50.738
Yo!

48:55.326 --> 48:56.326
Tara?

48:58.704 --> 48:59.704
Dawn?

49:01.207 --> 49:02.207
Hello?

49:14.428 --> 49:15.428
No.

49:17.890 --> 49:18.890
Emily?

49:23.020 --> 49:24.020
Emily?

49:27.149 --> 49:28.149
Okay-

49:29.026 --> 49:30.444
You're scaring mommy now.

49:50.339 --> 49:51.339
Hello?

49:54.510 --> 49:55.510
Anyone here?

50:06.314 --> 50:07.314
Come on, you GUYS-

50:09.525 --> 50:10.860
- Emily, mommy's here.

50:11.736 --> 50:12.736
Where are you?

50:14.864 --> 50:15.864
Emily?

50:17.283 --> 50:18.283
Honey?

50:37.678 --> 50:38.678
Tara?

50:51.776 --> 50:52.818
Give her to me.

50:57.531 --> 50:58.531
Please.

51:00.242 --> 51:02.161
Don't hurt my little girl.

51:11.253 --> 51:12.505
You're frightening her.

51:13.756 --> 51:14.757
Can't you see that?

51:15.800 --> 51:16.800
Emily?

51:17.551 --> 51:18.761
It's okay.

51:18.803 --> 51:19.803
Mommy's here.

51:38.239 --> 51:39.698
Is there kindness in you?

51:43.119 --> 51:45.371
Somewhere in your heart?

51:50.835 --> 51:54.547
Have you ever felt a mother's touch?

52:01.804 --> 52:03.681
Can you show no mercy?

52:07.435 --> 52:10.521
She's all I have in this world.

52:13.607 --> 52:14.607
Spare her.

52:55.191 --> 52:56.191
Shh.

52:58.527 --> 52:59.527
It's okay.

53:03.491 --> 53:04.491
Shh.

53:41.612 --> 53:42.655
Hi, you've reached Mike.

53:42.696 --> 53:43.489
Of course.

53:43.531 --> 53:45.699
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

53:45.741 --> 53:47.409
Mike, I'm outside.

53:47.451 --> 53:50.037
Every fuckin' door in
this place is locked.

53:50.079 --> 53:51.330
Answer your phone!

53:52.790 --> 53:53.790
Asshole.

54:01.131 --> 54:02.131
Hello?

54:04.301 --> 54:05.678
Is anybody in there?

54:08.222 --> 54:11.517
This is the fucking last time I do this.

54:13.644 --> 54:16.105
No consideration whatsoever.

54:22.403 --> 54:23.403
Dawn?

54:33.706 --> 54:34.706
Hello?

54:36.125 --> 54:37.125
Guys.

54:47.219 --> 54:48.387
I know you're in there.

54:48.429 --> 54:50.306
Dawn, I can hear your phone.

55:01.900 --> 55:03.211
I swear to god, if this is a prank,

55:03.235 --> 55:04.612
I'm gonna kill you both.

55:42.941 --> 55:43.941
Tara!

55:52.660 --> 55:53.660
Tara!

55:54.953 --> 55:56.246
Can you hear me?

56:41.500 --> 56:43.127
Oh, Tara, Tara, you're okay. It's okay.

56:43.168 --> 56:44.628
I'm gonna get help.

56:47.673 --> 56:48.799
What the fuck?

56:51.093 --> 56:52.553
Oh, it'll be okay.

56:53.595 --> 56:55.222
God, what's going on?

56:55.556 --> 56:57.599
' Emily?

56:59.059 --> 57:00.059
Help me.

57:02.563 --> 57:03.563
Help me.

57:25.085 --> 57:26.795
Somebody please help!

57:33.719 --> 57:34.719
Please!

57:42.019 --> 57:43.312
Help!

57:43.353 --> 57:45.314
Somebody please help me!

59:07.437 --> 59:08.730
Please, stop it!

59:10.732 --> 59:12.860
No, please leave me alone!

59:20.701 --> 59:21.701
Yo, Mike!

59:33.380 --> 59:34.590
Son of a bitch.

59:41.471 --> 59:42.723
You're on your own, buddy.

01:00:19.885 --> 01:00:20.885
Mike!

01:00:36.068 --> 01:00:37.069
Hello?

01:07:16.301 --> 01:07:17.301
Come on.

01:07:41.117 --> 01:07:42.117
No.

01:08:06.267 --> 01:08:07.435
You can't be dead, Tara.

01:08:08.645 --> 01:08:09.645
Fuck, Tara.

01:08:12.649 --> 01:08:14.651
Please wake up.

01:08:14.692 --> 01:08:17.987
No, you can't be dead, Tara, look at me.

01:09:07.245 --> 01:09:09.037
I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:13.126
Come on, I'm gonna get
you out of here right now.

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:31.853
Oh Jesus, you alright?

01:09:31.895 --> 01:09:32.937
Stay with me.

01:09:34.272 --> 01:09:35.814
I'm feeling a little tired.

01:09:35.857 --> 01:09:37.484
I know, it's okay.

01:09:37.524 --> 01:09:39.027
Just relax, it's gonna be fine.

01:09:45.617 --> 01:09:46.408
There's a phone over there.

01:09:46.451 --> 01:09:47.636
I'm gonna call the police, okay?

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:48.953
_ No!

01:09:48.995 --> 01:09:50.055
Please don't leave, don't leave me.

01:09:50.078 --> 01:09:52.540
I am not gonna leave you, I promise.

01:09:52.582 --> 01:09:53.767
I'm just going right over there.

01:09:53.791 --> 01:09:54.791
Look.

01:10:03.426 --> 01:10:04.302
911, emergency.

01:10:04.344 --> 01:10:05.678
Uh yes, I need the police

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:06.679
and paramedics here right away.

01:10:06.721 --> 01:10:08.056
What's wrong, sir?

01:10:08.097 --> 01:10:09.015
I wanna report a murder.

01:10:09.057 --> 01:10:10.183
There's two dead people.

01:10:10.225 --> 01:10:11.535
I've got this young woman over here

01:10:11.559 --> 01:10:12.352
that's just been assaulted.

01:10:12.393 --> 01:10:13.436
She's bleeding everywhere.

01:10:13.478 --> 01:10:15.063
I think she's going into shock.

01:10:15.104 --> 01:10:16.773
Okay, give me your address.

01:10:16.814 --> 01:10:19.317
Uh, Steuben Street,
it's the old warehouse.

01:10:20.401 --> 01:10:22.403
What kind of
injuries does she have?

01:10:22.445 --> 01:10:23.530
She's cut all over.

01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:26.199
Some places really deep.

01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:27.801
I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

01:10:27.825 --> 01:10:29.035
Is she conscious?

01:10:29.077 --> 01:10:30.745
Yes, she conscious, but I have no idea.

01:10:30.787 --> 01:10:31.996
For how long.

01:10:32.038 --> 01:10:33.456
Where is the assailant now?

01:10:33.498 --> 01:10:34.707
I knocked him out.

01:10:35.625 --> 01:10:38.836
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

01:10:38.878 --> 01:10:42.215
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

01:10:43.341 --> 01:10:45.009
Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

01:10:45.051 --> 01:10:47.345
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me.

01:10:47.387 --> 01:10:48.596
Until the police arrive.

01:10:49.639 --> 01:10:50.431
Look.

01:10:50.473 --> 01:10:51.266
We are not staying here.

01:10:51.307 --> 01:10:53.101
I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

01:10:53.142 --> 01:10:55.395
You just get your asses down here now.

01:10:57.564 --> 01:10:58.356
I got my truck outside.

01:10:58.398 --> 01:10:59.566
Can you walk?

01:10:59.607 --> 01:11:00.900
Okay-

01:11:00.942 --> 01:11:04.153
Come on, let's get out of here.

01:11:13.997 --> 01:11:14.997
Dammit!

01:11:39.564 --> 01:11:40.564
<i>_</i> No, stop!

01:11:42.358 --> 01:11:43.651
Stop!

01:12:38.539 --> 01:12:39.539
Dammit!

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.684
Get away from me!

01:13:39.726 --> 01:13:40.935
Leave me alone!

01:13:41.894 --> 01:13:43.438
You fucking maniac!

01:13:44.981 --> 01:13:48.568
Leave me alone!

01:13:48.609 --> 01:13:49.736
Stop, stop it!

01:15:55.444 --> 01:15:57.738
Police, don't fuckin' move!

01:15:57.780 --> 01:15:59.031
Put your hands up right now!

01:15:59.073 --> 01:15:59.866
Central.

01:15:59.907 --> 01:16:00.700
10-13, male perp.

01:16:00.741 --> 01:16:01.534
Possibly armed.

01:16:01.576 --> 01:16:02.368
Let me see your hands!

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:03.202
Send more units.

01:16:03.244 --> 01:16:04.346
I said show me your hands!

01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:05.288
Put 'em up!

01:16:05.329 --> 01:16:06.956
I said put your fuckin hands up!

01:16:11.168 --> 01:16:13.129
That's it, nice and easy.

01:16:13.170 --> 01:16:15.006
No sudden moves.

01:16:15.047 --> 01:16:16.090
Your right hand.

01:16:16.132 --> 01:16:17.049
Show me the right hand.

01:16:17.091 --> 01:16:17.884
Last warning.

01:16:17.925 --> 01:16:19.051
You're gonna get shot!

01:16:28.311 --> 01:16:29.311
Do it!

01:16:32.607 --> 01:16:33.858
[No, no]

01:16:43.367 --> 01:16:46.787
Central, we got shots fired.

01:16:46.829 --> 01:16:48.039
Multiple causalities.

01:16:49.373 --> 01:16:52.710
We needed buses and immediate assistance.

01:16:57.506 --> 01:16:58.799
Oh my god.

01:16:58.841 --> 01:16:59.841
What?

01:17:03.638 --> 01:17:05.264
She's still alive.

01:17:29.789 --> 01:17:30.706
Aw, come on, guys.

01:17:30.748 --> 01:17:31.958
You're killin' me.

01:17:31.999 --> 01:17:34.335
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

01:17:35.252 --> 01:17:36.587
Good to see you, too, doc.

01:17:39.215 --> 01:17:40.633
Okay, what are you bringing me?

01:17:40.675 --> 01:17:42.635
Murder, suicide.

01:17:42.677 --> 01:17:43.886
Wonderful.

01:17:43.928 --> 01:17:45.680
What's behind showcase number one?

01:17:45.721 --> 01:17:47.181
Severe head trauma.

01:17:47.223 --> 01:17:48.450
You're probably gonna have to identify

01:17:48.474 --> 01:17:50.601
this poor bastard by his teeth,

01:17:50.643 --> 01:17:52.853
If you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

01:17:52.895 --> 01:17:55.231
So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

01:17:55.272 --> 01:17:56.708
You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

01:17:56.732 --> 01:17:57.692
than coffee.

01:17:57.733 --> 01:18:00.361
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

01:18:00.403 --> 01:18:02.822
Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

01:18:02.863 --> 01:18:04.031
Showcase number two.

01:18:06.575 --> 01:18:07.785
No shit.

01:18:07.827 --> 01:18:09.554
Police found him eating
the face off of some.

01:18:09.578 --> 01:18:12.540
Young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

01:18:12.581 --> 01:18:16.919
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:18.629
Halloween never disappoints, does it?

01:18:18.671 --> 01:18:20.756
And it looks like it's
just getting started.

01:18:20.798 --> 01:18:22.025
Well, seeing as how I'm gonna be here

01:18:22.049 --> 01:18:24.218
for another 24 hours, thanks to you,

01:18:25.136 --> 01:18:26.905
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich.

01:18:26.929 --> 01:18:28.973
With bacon, or something with bacon?

01:18:29.015 --> 01:18:30.016
Bacon, really?

01:18:31.017 --> 01:18:32.744
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

01:18:32.768 --> 01:18:34.020
I am watchin' it.

01:18:34.061 --> 01:18:35.354
Watchin' it go up.

01:18:35.396 --> 01:18:36.772
Who's the MD around here?

01:18:36.814 --> 01:18:38.494
How can you eat a greasy croissant while.

01:18:38.524 --> 01:18:40.401
You're cutting up dead bodies?

01:18:40.443 --> 01:18:41.402
Sweetheart.

01:18:41.444 --> 01:18:41.610
I've been doin' this 22 years.

01:18:41.611 --> 01:18:43.446
I've been doin this 22 years.

01:18:43.487 --> 01:18:44.756
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:45.781
microwaved to death,

01:18:47.700 --> 01:18:49.285
Everything else is just old hat.

01:18:51.662 --> 01:18:53.289
Look, you had to ask, alright?

01:18:53.330 --> 01:18:54.957
I'll hook you up, doc.

01:18:54.999 --> 01:18:55.999
That's my GUY-

01:18:57.585 --> 01:18:59.211
Stay safe out there.

01:19:10.264 --> 01:19:11.264
Jesus.

01:19:21.567 --> 01:19:24.945
Let's have a look at the man of the hour.

01:19:35.748 --> 01:19:37.625
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:39.251
You sick son of a bitch.

01:19:58.187 --> 01:20:01.440
You're really
going to like it here.

01:20:46.527 --> 01:20:48.195
Thanks again for everything, doctor.

01:20:48.237 --> 01:20:49.655
You'll be in our prayers.

01:20:49.697 --> 01:20:51.824
Please, don't mention it.

01:20:51.866 --> 01:20:53.450
We're all gonna miss this one.

01:20:53.492 --> 01:20:54.994
She's been so cooperative.

01:20:55.035 --> 01:20:56.787
Makes everyone laugh.

01:20:57.663 --> 01:20:58.497
Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

01:20:58.539 --> 01:21:00.291
Yeah, still a wise ass.

01:21:01.208 --> 01:21:02.001
It's good.

01:21:02.042 --> 01:21:03.419
It's a good thing.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.171
It's important to stay positive, right?
