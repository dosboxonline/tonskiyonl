Kate's car seat is right?

10:11.486 --> 10:13.405
-Yeah.
-Are you sure?

10:13.488 --> 10:15.240
I mean, maybe we should just pull over.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.658
No, baby, it's fine.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.454
Hey, hey, babe, babe,
you're gonna hurt your...

10:21.538 --> 10:24.582
-you're gonna hurt yourself.
-I'm okay, I'm okay.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.418
(exhales)

10:26.501 --> 10:29.212
Now, does Kevin's head look weird to you?

10:29.295 --> 10:32.048
No.
Kevin's fine.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.259
It seems like it's just
flopped over to one side.

10:34.342 --> 10:35.927
What do you think is gonna happen,

10:36.011 --> 10:37.303
you think his head's just gonna fall off?

10:37.387 --> 10:38.680
(imitates soft thud)

10:41.558 --> 10:43.393
(pop song continues quietly)

10:43.476 --> 10:45.311
He's fine.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.317
(baby crying loudly)

10:51.401 --> 10:53.987
(two babies crying loudly)

10:54.988 --> 10:56.614
Great.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.866
It's okay, guys.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.784
Please stop crying.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.870
(loud crying continues)

11:01.953 --> 11:03.413
REBECCA:
It's okay.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.499
(babies' crying distorting, fading)

11:11.796 --> 11:13.298
Pacifier?

11:13.381 --> 11:16.009
-Check.
-(Annie fussing)

11:16.092 --> 11:17.344
Sun hat?

11:17.427 --> 11:19.054
Check.

11:20.263 --> 11:23.183
Water for extremely thirsty
breastfeeding mom.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.143
Mind reader!

11:25.226 --> 11:27.228
Man, we're, like, the dream team.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.022
Ooh, I like that.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.648
But if we're gonna do basketball,

11:30.732 --> 11:32.233
can we be the '96 Bulls?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.110
I always saw you as Pippen to my Jordan.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.236
Excuse me?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.489
I had the baby.
I am Jordan.

11:37.572 --> 11:40.033
Fair enough.
You comfortable back there?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.160
-Hundred percent not at all.
-(chuckles)

11:42.243 --> 11:43.620
I should've just sat up front.

11:46.498 --> 11:48.667
We should think about a new car.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.294
Pushing for that Mercedes S-Class again?

11:51.378 --> 11:53.922
Nah.
Family car, so we have more space.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.841
You know, in case we have a third.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.594
A third what?

11:59.678 --> 12:01.221
I said "in case."

12:01.304 --> 12:03.306
My insides are basically
on my outsides right now,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.392
and you're talking to me
about a third kid?

12:05.475 --> 12:08.103
-Okay, I'm sorry, I take it back.
-You know what's two things

12:08.186 --> 12:10.730
-you don't do to a brand-new mother?
-Oh... I'm sorry.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.357
-Mention having a new baby...
-Mm-hmm.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.567
...and two is drive past the Dairy Queen

12:14.651 --> 12:16.027
when you promised her a Snickers Blizzard.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.154
Copy that.
All good.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.198
I'll bust a "U" up here.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.159
See, Annie, this is why sometimes Jordan

12:23.243 --> 12:25.912
just did it all by his damn self.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.624
MADISON:
I am obsessed with their faces.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.625
KEVIN:
Yeah?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.544
Kind of want to eat them.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.254
-(chuckles)
-Not in a bad way.

12:34.337 --> 12:35.630
(Kevin yawns)

12:35.714 --> 12:37.799
-You all good?
-Yeah. No, I'm good.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.510
-I'm just tired, you know?
-You need me to drive?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.679
No. No, no, no, of course not.
You just had two babies.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.889
You've been up all hours of the night.
I got this.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.477
(sighs heavily)

12:51.730 --> 12:53.857
I feel like I'm seeing things.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.942
Okay, I am definitely driving.

12:56.026 --> 12:58.570
No, I mean, I think we're being
followed, is what I'm saying.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.992
This guy's been following us
the past two turns.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.827
I think he's paparazzi.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.798
Ooh, so, there's, like, no traffic at all.

13:18.882 --> 13:22.344
You must be excited
to get home, see Willow.

13:22.427 --> 13:23.595
Yeah.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.096
(Hailey fussing)

13:25.180 --> 13:27.098
Oh, and I know that you said
that, you know,

13:27.182 --> 13:29.476
you want her to meet Hailey
in a couple of weeks,

13:29.559 --> 13:32.020
so we can definitely come down
to you, but there is this park

13:32.103 --> 13:34.147
near our house that has this zip line

13:34.230 --> 13:36.399
that I think Willow would really like.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.901
Of course, we're coming down there

13:37.984 --> 13:39.361
for her birthday next month.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.654
Oh, does she...
does Willow still like unicorns?

13:41.738 --> 13:44.032
Or are unicorns, like, so last week...

13:44.115 --> 13:45.658
Yeah, she's into unicorns.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.452
(Hailey fussing)

13:47.535 --> 13:50.163
I will never not like unicorns.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.832
(Kate chuckles)

13:59.464 --> 14:02.300
-It's just a couple of blocks down on the right.
-Okay.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.344
Okay, so, uh, we'll call you, you know,

14:04.427 --> 14:06.554
once we're all settled in and everything.
And listen,

14:06.638 --> 14:08.431
if you want to go
to that park that I mentioned...

14:08.515 --> 14:10.433
Hey, I'm sorry,
but I can't, I can't do this.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.561
What do you mean?

14:13.645 --> 14:17.941
Um, I know that we said yes
to open adoption, and we said...

14:18.024 --> 14:19.734
yes to visits and photos and phone calls,

14:19.818 --> 14:20.735
but I-I can't do it.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.529
I can't have her in my life.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.072
I don't know, maybe... maybe someday

14:24.155 --> 14:26.116
I'll be able to, but I can't right now.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.829
Well, maybe it's something
that we can talk about.

14:30.912 --> 14:32.372
-I mean, how can we make it work...
-Kate. Kate, Kate...

14:32.455 --> 14:33.915
Kate, I don't want to talk about it.

14:33.998 --> 14:35.834
I really just want
to say goodbye to Hailey,

14:35.917 --> 14:36.918
and I want to go home.

14:37.002 --> 14:38.920
I'm sorry.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.507
(softly):
It's okay.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.761
It's okay.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.227
(babies crying loudly)

14:54.310 --> 14:56.021
It's okay, guys.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.190
Be just a little bit longer now.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.900
(crying continues)

15:00.984 --> 15:03.445
(sighs)
I should be in the back with them.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.531
I think this is just normal crying.

15:10.410 --> 15:11.870
(horn honking)

15:11.953 --> 15:14.622
Yeah, going as fast as I can, pal.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.624
(honking horn)

15:17.792 --> 15:19.961
I'm-I'm gonna get some gas, fill up.

15:20.045 --> 15:20.962
Okay.

15:21.046 --> 15:23.256
(revving engine)

15:23.340 --> 15:25.425
(horn honking)

15:25.508 --> 15:27.761
-JACK: Hey!
-(tires squeal)

15:27.844 --> 15:28.845
JACK:
Ooh!

15:30.347 --> 15:32.307
-What a maniac!
-What the hell?

15:32.390 --> 15:34.893
What the hell is it with this guy?

15:34.976 --> 15:36.686
(babies continue crying)

15:36.770 --> 15:40.023
Hey, hey, hey, Jack,
let it go, let it g...

15:40.106 --> 15:41.441
Jack!

15:43.443 --> 15:45.987
-Jack! Jack?
-Hey, what are you doing, man?

15:46.071 --> 15:47.697
I got three newborns in that car!

15:47.781 --> 15:49.991
-REBECCA: Hey. Jack?
-That's not my problem.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.285
-Jack, get back here right now!
-MAN: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:57.332 --> 15:59.000
Just...

15:59.084 --> 16:01.419
be more careful, would you?

16:05.215 --> 16:06.883
What is the matter with you?

16:06.966 --> 16:08.885
We have three newborn babies

16:08.968 --> 16:10.887
-in the car.
-You know what? You're right.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.348
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm gonna fill up.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.433
(crying continues)

16:26.486 --> 16:28.780
<i>KEVIN: See, this is what happens</i>
<i>to these paparazzi.</i>

16:28.863 --> 16:30.532
You know, this is what happens.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.868
They-they get tipped off by the hospital,
a nurse or an admin.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.453
Someone tells them when we're leaving.

16:35.537 --> 16:36.913
That's how it happens.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.916
(mutters)
Get rid of this guy.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.751
Kevin, okay, Kevin, stop it.
Kevin, pull over.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.420
-No, pull over.
-(stammers)

16:50.677 --> 16:52.512
Oh, here we go.
Look, our friend here pulled over, too.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.514
Oh, that's nice.
You want to go? Huh?

16:54.597 --> 16:56.266
-MADISON: No. No.
-You want to go? Let's go.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.810
-Kevin, Kevin, do not go. Kevin!
-You want to go?

16:58.893 --> 17:00.478
Let's go.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.231
What the hell, man?

17:03.314 --> 17:06.109
-Just out for a drive.
-You're out for a drive?

17:06.192 --> 17:07.777
You're ruining a very special
moment between me and my family.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.071
I'm not breaking any laws.
I'm just doing my job.

17:10.155 --> 17:12.157
Doing your job.
Get that camera out of my face.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.951
Get the camera out of my face.
I'm a brand-new dad, I got

17:15.035 --> 17:16.953
-a very low threshold right now. Keep it out of my face.
-Kevin!

17:17.037 --> 17:18.079
-Kevin? Kevin, no.
-Get back in the car. I got this.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.914
-Go back to...
-Don't take pictures

17:19.998 --> 17:21.416
-Kevin!
-...of her, man. Don't take a picture...

17:21.499 --> 17:24.085
Kevin. Go back to the babies.
I've got this.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.297
Now. Go.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.343
Hi. I'm sorry.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.470
We're all a little overtired here.
New parents.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.014
-Do you have kids?
-No.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.974
-Nieces or nephews?
-No.

17:38.058 --> 17:41.603
Okay, well, what if, uh,
a friend or a member

17:41.686 --> 17:43.897
-of your family...?
-I don't talk to my family.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.816
I have no friends.
I'm a very lonely person.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.363
Okay, give me your number.

17:51.446 --> 17:53.448
He goes jogging every Tuesday
around 9:00 a.m.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.158
I will call you, you can get the shot.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.660
-Shirtless?
-Excuse me?

17:57.744 --> 17:59.579
The picture's worth more
if he's not wearing a shirt.

17:59.662 --> 18:02.123
Fine. I will make sure
he's not wearing a shirt.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.917
Tight shorts so I can see his package.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.585
Ugh.
That's disgusting.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.170
Thank you.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.931
What did you say to that guy?

18:18.014 --> 18:20.433
Okay, Kevin, you're exhausted.

18:20.517 --> 18:24.396
Okay?
I'm gonna need you at your best.

18:24.479 --> 18:29.025
And aggro Liam Neeson
movie Kevin is not you at your best.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.987
We have 20 minutes
until we get home.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.989
I'm driving.
Get some rest.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.741
I've got this.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.253
Here we go.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.671
Gonna stretch my legs.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.131
Okay.
(sniffles)

18:51.214 --> 18:52.799
I'll go in and get it for you.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.427
One Snickers Blizzard coming right up.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.804
-What size?
-Is that even a question?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.347
The biggest Snickers Blizzard.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.307
A Snickers avalanche if they have it.

19:01.391 --> 19:03.977
No school for days
after I eat this Blizzard.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.437
-(chuckles)
-I'm talking power outages

19:05.520 --> 19:07.772
and white-out conditions.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.362
What?

19:15.864 --> 19:17.782
Can I just say one more thing

19:17.866 --> 19:19.784
about not closing the door
to having a third kid?

19:19.868 --> 19:22.162
Are you out of your mind?
Do I have to throw something at you?

19:22.245 --> 19:24.789
I guess I always thought
that if we had two girls,

19:24.873 --> 19:26.291
that we would go for a boy.

19:26.374 --> 19:29.044
You did not just say "go for a boy."

19:29.127 --> 19:31.129
I always imagined myself
throwing the ball around

19:31.212 --> 19:33.381
with the boy, you know,
having that special relationship?

19:33.465 --> 19:35.425
Special relationship?
You used to go over to your mom's house

19:35.508 --> 19:37.385
-every Sunday to watch <i>Felicity</i> together.
-I...

19:37.469 --> 19:39.220
You think that wasn't
a special relationship?

19:39.304 --> 19:40.722
It doesn't have to be a boy.

19:40.805 --> 19:41.973
I would love a third girl.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.476
I'm just saying, we make great kids.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.102
And I don't want to close the door.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.271
Then, Randall, you carry the next one.

19:49.522 --> 19:51.274
I'm gonna get my own Blizzard.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.453
(sighs)

20:16.841 --> 20:18.802
(clears throat)

20:22.180 --> 20:23.640
You're late.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.476
You want to be on time, get your own car.

20:27.936 --> 20:29.771
(both laugh)

20:29.854 --> 20:31.856
Just wrong.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.696
-Oh.
-Mm.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.739
What's this?

20:39.823 --> 20:42.909
I know it's early, and I know
you're not telling anyone,

20:42.992 --> 20:45.078
but I had to get you something.

20:45.161 --> 20:46.871
It's this old-school toy from France.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.165
They're like magic for babies.

20:53.253 --> 20:54.963
It's not gonna stay a secret long

20:55.046 --> 20:56.715
if you keep touching your belly like that.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.467
-What? I didn't touch my belly.
-Mm-hmm.

21:00.552 --> 21:02.637
It is cute, right?

21:02.721 --> 21:05.056
You're gonna love it.
It is like magic.

21:05.140 --> 21:07.142
-(both laugh)
-You ready?

21:07.225 --> 21:09.310
I'm ready.
(laughs)

21:09.394 --> 21:11.396
(indistinct chatter)

21:14.107 --> 21:16.901
(babies crying)

21:20.905 --> 21:23.199
(bell dings)

21:23.283 --> 21:25.243
(crying continues)

21:39.257 --> 21:41.509
-Hey.
-Uh, number four.

21:41.593 --> 21:44.095
And these.

21:46.556 --> 21:48.558
$12.32.
Anything else?

21:48.641 --> 21:50.018
Uh...

21:50.101 --> 21:51.603
Yeah.
Why don't...

21:51.686 --> 21:55.106
I get one of those, uh, little whiskeys?

21:55.190 --> 21:57.025
And these mints?

21:57.108 --> 21:58.943
(sniffles)

22:00.612 --> 22:03.323
New dad.
Celebrating.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.533
All right.
Congrats.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.639
Thought you might be hungry.

22:27.722 --> 22:31.309
Um... hey, baby, how bout...

22:31.393 --> 22:34.229
how about you drive?
You okay to drive?

22:34.312 --> 22:38.316
That way, I can turn around
and make sure the kids are okay.

22:40.402 --> 22:42.570
-Yeah, okay.
-Okay.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.829
She took the bottle,

22:50.912 --> 22:52.789
and she's out.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.791
You can just call me "Dr. Sleep."

22:54.874 --> 22:56.376
Wait.

22:56.459 --> 22:58.128
No, don't do that.

22:58.211 --> 23:00.171
It sounds...
(sighs)

23:00.255 --> 23:02.007
...murdery.

23:02.090 --> 23:04.259
Well, great.
Thank you.

23:04.342 --> 23:06.219
I just spoke to the babysitter,

23:06.302 --> 23:08.763
and she's gonna bring Jack home
in half an hour, so...

23:11.099 --> 23:12.976
Kate, there's something
I need to talk to you...

23:13.059 --> 23:15.103
Toby, how are you not more upset
about this?

23:15.186 --> 23:16.604
Honestly.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.648
We signed up for an open adoption,

23:18.732 --> 23:20.650
and that just all changed

23:20.734 --> 23:22.694
in a really sad blink of an eye.

23:22.777 --> 23:26.114
Kate, I am sorry that Ellie is hurting.

23:26.197 --> 23:28.116
I feel bad.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.826
But when we got into all of this,

23:29.909 --> 23:31.619
we knew that it was all just a plan.

23:31.703 --> 23:34.247
We also knew that plans change.

23:34.330 --> 23:36.291
Toby, I grew up with a brother

23:36.374 --> 23:40.086
who, like, didn't know his birth parents.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.881
That was... is... is still

23:42.964 --> 23:44.466
really, really difficult for him.

23:44.549 --> 23:47.635
-I know.
-Okay, well, I promised myself

23:47.719 --> 23:49.804
that it would not be like that for Hailey.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.765
And it won't.

23:51.848 --> 23:56.227
Kate, adoption is a journey.

23:56.311 --> 23:58.646
You know, and-and we don't know when or if

23:58.730 --> 24:01.691
Ellie is gonna change her mind,
but we will always make sure

24:01.775 --> 24:03.777
that Hailey knows who her birth mother is.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.236
(Hailey crying)

24:05.320 --> 24:06.821
-I'll get her.
-I'll get her.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.074
All right.
(sighs)

24:09.157 --> 24:10.575
(Toby sniffles)

24:10.658 --> 24:12.660
(Hailey cries loudly)

24:13.703 --> 24:16.206
I apologize that you had to listen

24:16.289 --> 24:19.250
to that little dispute
between me and your mother.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.796
And I apologize
for my antiquated gender assumptions.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.090
I will throw a ball with you
any day of the week.

24:25.173 --> 24:28.259
Or watch <i>Felicity, </i>whatever you like.

24:29.761 --> 24:32.263
So you and I have the same eyes.

24:33.390 --> 24:37.644
When the nurse said that,
it made me very happy.

24:39.354 --> 24:43.692
Because I grew up not looking
like either of my parents,

24:43.775 --> 24:46.528
not knowing exactly where I came from.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.989
So to know that you have my eyes,

24:50.073 --> 24:53.076
that you came from me--

24:53.159 --> 24:55.120
that's special.

24:55.203 --> 24:57.539
Thank you.

24:57.622 --> 24:59.541
When I was a kid,

24:59.624 --> 25:03.420
I had to do a family tree for school.

25:06.339 --> 25:09.676
And, um, I remember making my branches,

25:09.759 --> 25:13.054
along with my brother and sister.

25:13.138 --> 25:15.640
But I knew it wasn't quite right.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.350
They were my family,

25:17.434 --> 25:20.353
but they weren't where I came from.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.689
You see, that's where you

25:22.772 --> 25:25.358
and your sister Tess and your mom come in.

25:25.442 --> 25:29.070
You've provided me
with something very special.

25:31.614 --> 25:33.616
Because you are my branches.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.954
You are the start of my family tree.

25:40.206 --> 25:44.044
And I just wanted that tree
to be as big as possible.

25:47.839 --> 25:51.301
But, hey, I guess I'm gonna have
to count on you and your sister

25:51.384 --> 25:54.929
to have a whole lot of grandchildren.

25:55.013 --> 25:57.265
And then maybe one day,
I will look into the eyes

25:57.349 --> 26:00.727
of my grandchild or my great-grandchild,

26:00.810 --> 26:02.979
and I will say,

26:03.063 --> 26:07.567
"Hey, I know where those eyes come from."

26:08.651 --> 26:12.113
"Those eyes come from Annie Pearson."

26:13.281 --> 26:14.449
(sniffles loudly)

26:14.532 --> 26:16.159
That's a peace offering?

26:16.242 --> 26:17.869
No, they're both for me.

26:17.952 --> 26:20.663
(Randall smacks lips, hisses)

26:38.807 --> 26:40.392
All right.

26:40.475 --> 26:42.811
Do not interrupt me
for the next ten minutes.

26:42.894 --> 26:44.771
All right.
I don't know if you're ready.

26:44.854 --> 26:47.232
-I'm ready. Oh, I'm ready.
-Yeah?

26:52.570 --> 26:54.572
(engine running)

27:08.503 --> 27:10.171
(engine shuts off)

27:18.596 --> 27:20.181
Oh. Uh...

27:20.265 --> 27:22.183
Are they actually...?

27:22.267 --> 27:24.269
Let me... let me check.

27:44.789 --> 27:46.750
All three knocked out.

27:46.833 --> 27:50.545
(whispering): They must have
exhausted themselves crying.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.172
Do we bring 'em inside?

27:52.255 --> 27:54.632
Oh, no, no, no.
They say never wake a sleeping baby.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.510
Well, what do they say
about three sleeping babies?

28:00.388 --> 28:02.432
I think we just wait.

28:02.515 --> 28:05.226
Okay.

28:09.606 --> 28:11.608
(Rebecca sighs)

28:28.541 --> 28:30.543
(Hailey cooing)

28:38.802 --> 28:40.804
(Kate sighs softly)

28:41.805 --> 28:44.766
She's only happy when I'm holding her.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.268
-So...
-Like daughter, like father.

28:52.065 --> 28:54.067
Kate, do you know why Ellie chose us?

28:54.150 --> 28:56.611
'Cause I like the Steelers?

28:56.695 --> 28:59.072
Maybe.
(laughs)

28:59.155 --> 29:01.491
I'm sure my quirky-meets-classy style

29:01.574 --> 29:03.576
-didn't hurt anything.
-(chuckles)

29:05.370 --> 29:09.833
But more than that,
she chose us, she chose you,

29:09.916 --> 29:13.962
because she saw a funny, beautiful,

29:14.045 --> 29:17.007
huge-hearted mother
who has taken every challenge

29:17.090 --> 29:20.635
that parenting has to offer
in total stride.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.637
Kate, you're unflappable.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.639
Really.
You cannot be flapped.

29:24.723 --> 29:27.017
All right, and-and all of this
may not be going

29:27.100 --> 29:28.727
the way that we planned,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.271
and Ellie may or may not be
in the picture,

29:31.354 --> 29:32.939
but we will figure this out.

29:33.023 --> 29:36.192
And I think Ellie knew that
from the start.

29:36.276 --> 29:41.072
And it's a good thing that you are...

29:41.156 --> 29:45.076
so unflappable, because earlier today,

29:45.160 --> 29:48.830
when I was on the phone with work...

29:48.913 --> 29:50.540
I got laid off.

29:51.958 --> 29:53.168
What?

29:56.671 --> 29:58.631
Oh, um...

30:00.467 --> 30:01.634
Toby, I am...

30:01.718 --> 30:03.553
(Hailey fusses)

30:03.636 --> 30:04.679
(sighs)
I am so sorry.

30:04.763 --> 30:06.097
Yeah, I...

30:06.181 --> 30:08.308
I kind of knew that it was coming,

30:08.391 --> 30:11.603
but I didn't want to freak you out.

30:11.686 --> 30:14.814
But they let, like, 40% of the staff go.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.441
Wow.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.193
Yeah, and I've been torturing myself

30:18.276 --> 30:19.861
for the last few hours
'cause I knew I had to tell you,

30:19.944 --> 30:22.197
but I didn't want to ruin today.

30:23.281 --> 30:26.326
You are never gonna ruin anything,

30:26.409 --> 30:28.411
and you're not gonna ruin this day.

30:30.830 --> 30:34.000
And we can figure out
the job stuff tomorrow.

30:34.084 --> 30:36.044
Okay?
Let's just be a family today.

30:38.171 --> 30:40.090
Me, you, and two under two.

30:40.173 --> 30:41.841
Exactly.

30:41.925 --> 30:44.135
Piece of cake.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.806
See?

30:47.889 --> 30:50.558
Unflappable.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.644
(Franny and Nick crying in distance)

31:19.379 --> 31:21.381
(crying stops)

31:26.219 --> 31:28.054
How'd you get 'em to stop crying?

31:32.225 --> 31:34.227
Dumb luck.

31:37.313 --> 31:40.900
And you-- you and Mom had three.

31:41.985 --> 31:43.570
No help, just the two of you.

31:43.653 --> 31:45.739
How'd you manage?

31:45.822 --> 31:48.241
Oh, that was easy.

31:48.324 --> 31:52.829
You kids and your mom--

31:52.912 --> 31:54.414
that was all I ever wanted.

31:54.497 --> 31:57.625
It was easy to do it when you,

31:57.709 --> 32:00.211
when you look at it like that.

32:02.797 --> 32:04.758
Yeah.

32:08.470 --> 32:10.722
They're beautiful, Kevin.

32:11.806 --> 32:13.600
Do 'em a favor.

32:14.601 --> 32:17.354
Stop trying to live up to me.

32:17.437 --> 32:20.231
I was terrified of being like my dad,

32:20.315 --> 32:24.569
and you are terrified
of not being like yours.

32:26.446 --> 32:31.409
We both wasted a lot of time
being quietly terrified.

32:35.622 --> 32:37.332
Close your eyes,

32:37.415 --> 32:39.542
decide what you want,

32:39.626 --> 32:42.337
and then you go and get it, son.

32:54.933 --> 32:57.143
They really are beautiful, Kev.

33:18.289 --> 33:20.208
Hey, how long was I out?

33:20.291 --> 33:22.085
Shh.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.670
Uh, not long.

33:23.753 --> 33:26.297
15 minutes.

33:26.381 --> 33:27.507
15-- you should've woken me up.

33:27.590 --> 33:29.259
I had it under control.

33:29.342 --> 33:32.429
-(fussing)
-I think Franny's hungry.

33:32.512 --> 33:35.473
Is that what you want?

33:35.557 --> 33:37.809
Or maybe you just want
to be rocked, is that it?

33:37.892 --> 33:38.977
You just want to be rocked?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.478
I don't know what you want.

33:40.562 --> 33:42.647
You sound a little like a velociraptor.

33:42.731 --> 33:44.733
(Madison chuckles)

33:48.695 --> 33:49.904
You okay?

33:52.073 --> 33:53.700
Yeah, I'm great.

33:58.705 --> 34:00.707
-Madison.
-Yeah.

34:03.585 --> 34:05.045
Let's make this official.

34:06.755 --> 34:09.758
I know we've been engaged,
but not <i>engaged</i> engaged,

34:09.841 --> 34:13.386
and dancing around the weirdness
of it all, but I...

34:15.513 --> 34:17.474
...I really want you to be my wife.

34:19.893 --> 34:21.895
I want to be a family.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.649
Look, I will, I will get you
whatever ring that you want

34:26.733 --> 34:28.443
whenever you want it
because you deserve that,

34:28.526 --> 34:29.819
but until then...

34:31.321 --> 34:32.781
-(Madison laughs)
-(groans)

34:32.864 --> 34:34.783
I mean, these things are...
these are just...

34:34.866 --> 34:36.034
-(laughs)
-(snaps)

34:36.117 --> 34:37.619
There we go.

34:39.037 --> 34:41.039
Madison.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.418
Will you marry me?

34:47.087 --> 34:48.254
Yeah.

34:48.338 --> 34:50.632
-Yeah?
-Yeah. (laughs)

34:50.715 --> 34:52.592
♪ ♪

34:54.219 --> 34:55.387
It's gorgeous.

34:55.470 --> 34:56.554
(both laugh)

35:02.644 --> 35:04.646
(birds singing)

35:06.481 --> 35:08.733
You know, I think
this is the quietest it's gonna be

35:08.817 --> 35:11.152
for about 18 years.
(chuckles)

35:24.124 --> 35:26.835
I feel like there's the person I was

35:26.918 --> 35:28.837
before I went to the hospital

35:28.920 --> 35:32.298
and the person... I am now.

35:34.342 --> 35:36.845
I barely even remember who that girl was

35:36.928 --> 35:38.930
who got in the car four days ago.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.724
I do.

35:40.807 --> 35:44.561
I'm still me, we're still us.

35:46.146 --> 35:47.605
Maybe.

35:48.690 --> 35:50.025
I don't know.

35:50.108 --> 35:53.278
I do. Hey.

35:53.361 --> 35:55.363
I know.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.290
My mom lost a baby

36:05.373 --> 36:09.044
when I was five.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.256
She had a miscarriage.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.759
It was really early on, and...

36:17.969 --> 36:22.182
I barely even...
registered it at the time,

36:22.265 --> 36:24.642
but I think she was really sad.

36:24.726 --> 36:27.812
I think she was really sad
for a long time.

36:34.152 --> 36:36.571
What if I can't be a great mom

36:36.654 --> 36:40.033
'cause I'm just too sad for too long?

36:40.116 --> 36:44.037
Hey, Rebecca, look,
I worry about a lot of things,

36:44.120 --> 36:48.750
but I never, ever worry
about you not being a great mom.

36:49.834 --> 36:52.796
Okay?
That story's already written.

37:07.811 --> 37:11.898
When we stopped at the gas station...

37:14.818 --> 37:17.153
...I bought a little bottle of whiskey.

37:19.030 --> 37:21.241
I downed it right there.

37:23.243 --> 37:27.914
I was... feeling really overwhelmed

37:27.997 --> 37:29.541
by everything that's happened

37:29.624 --> 37:33.461
and I was just trying
to keep it together...

37:34.546 --> 37:38.842
...really, 'cause when that guy
cut us off, I just... I saw red.

37:39.926 --> 37:41.928
Lost control.

37:43.471 --> 37:45.098
Just like my dad would've.

37:45.181 --> 37:47.142
Jack.

37:47.225 --> 37:48.351
Yeah.

37:51.396 --> 37:55.608
Every night when I was a kid,

37:55.692 --> 37:59.988
my dad would come home
at 5:15 exactly.

38:01.156 --> 38:04.367
And my brother and me--
we'd be playing, uh, blocks,

38:04.451 --> 38:07.328
baseball... whatever,

38:07.412 --> 38:09.998
just happy as clams, and...

38:11.916 --> 38:15.754
...about 5:00, my heart
would just start pounding.

38:15.837 --> 38:17.756
Mm.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.841
And then I'd hear
my dad slam his car door,

38:19.924 --> 38:22.886
and all the air would get sucked
out of the room.

38:30.977 --> 38:34.189
He was so unhappy just to be around us.

38:37.275 --> 38:41.613
He-He'd have a Scotch in his hand
before he'd even say hello.

38:43.907 --> 38:47.577
He needed it just to be
in the same house with us.

38:49.662 --> 38:52.457
-Hmm.
-You are not gonna be that kind of dad.

38:53.917 --> 38:55.835
I don't know.

38:55.919 --> 38:57.879
I worry.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.888
You don't suck the air out of the room.

39:06.971 --> 39:08.932
You are the air.

Not bad.
