<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:49.342 --> 01:51.401
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

01:54.948 --> 01:57.212
Merry Christmas!

01:57.283 --> 01:59.547
Merry Christmas!

02:01.988 --> 02:05.947
Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas!

02:06.059 --> 02:07.075
Thank you. Thank you.

02:07.110 --> 02:08.092
Thank you. Thank you.

02:08.161 --> 02:12.222
Merry Christmas!
Ha ha, ho ho!

02:12.298 --> 02:14.858
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

02:16.936 --> 02:18.904
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

02:18.972 --> 02:22.066
<i>And a merry Christmas
to you.</i>

02:22.142 --> 02:24.337
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

02:35.488 --> 02:38.252
Oh, boy.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.623
Shit. He's got kids.

02:46.699 --> 02:49.668
Dog, cat-- Shit.

02:49.736 --> 02:52.864
That's no good.
It's no good.

03:05.218 --> 03:07.584
l- l-l-l-l--

03:17.964 --> 03:20.831
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.926
It has been two weeks
since my last confession.

03:24.003 --> 03:27.268
Is that Bill Firpo?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.274
Uh, yes, Father.

03:29.342 --> 03:34.143
It's been five years since you've been to
confession. Is that how you're gonna start?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.445
<i>- I'm sorry, Father.
- It's okay.</i>

03:37.517 --> 03:42.284
<i>Father... I found a wallet
in the street.</i>

03:42.388 --> 03:44.515
Did you do
the right thing?

03:44.624 --> 03:49.254
Well... yes, Father,
I did, eventually...

03:49.329 --> 03:52.196
with great difficulty.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.631
I dropped it in the mail.

03:54.701 --> 03:59.331
<i>It had over $800 in it, which I counted
many times on the subway.</i>

03:59.405 --> 04:03.068
I feel as if I've ruined
my karma, Father...

04:03.142 --> 04:08.079
and that something bad is gonna happen
as a result of this transgression.

04:08.147 --> 04:11.014
How many letters is that?

04:11.084 --> 04:15.248
Transgression? Uh...
I don't know.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.346
Uh... 13. Why, Father?

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
Never mind.

04:20.526 --> 04:23.689
<i>- Did you mail the wallet back?
- Yes.</i>

04:23.763 --> 04:29.668
I realized, uh... I'm really not that
much different than my two brothers.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.227
I can easily
be led astray.

04:32.305 --> 04:37.675
- Speaking of which, have you seen tonight's paper?
- No. Why?

04:37.744 --> 04:41.339
<i>Well, according to the Post, they may
be home for the holidays.</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:45.316
No, that's not possible.
They're not up for parole until March.

04:45.385 --> 04:48.377
<i>According to this article,
because of overcrowding...</i>

04:48.454 --> 04:51.423
anyone who's eligible
for parole through June...

04:51.491 --> 04:54.722
is being considered
for an early release.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.236
I'm in big trouble now.

05:09.309 --> 05:13.871
The pterodactyl.
It was a lizard back in prehistoric times...

05:13.946 --> 05:18.781
who developed an outside digit of the
forelimb which became greatly elongated...

05:18.851 --> 05:22.150
in order to support
a winged membrane.

05:22.255 --> 05:27.215
Now, he used this membrane to fly
high above his predators...

05:27.327 --> 05:31.593
which you gotta remember,
was way back in the Cretaceous period.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.895
And as far as periods go,
oh, it was a mother.

05:37.670 --> 05:40.696
<i>- Mr. Firpo.
- Uh, yes?</i>

05:40.773 --> 05:43.367
Where's all this going?

05:43.443 --> 05:46.207
Oh. Uh... well, uh...

05:46.279 --> 05:49.305
eh, skipping, skipping,
skipping, eh--

05:49.382 --> 05:54.752
What I, uh, I believe is that
once released from this prison...

05:54.854 --> 05:58.847
<i>I, much like my reptilian brother,
shall take wing...</i>

05:58.958 --> 06:01.256
and fly high above
my problems...

06:04.831 --> 06:07.823
never to return!

06:07.900 --> 06:11.996
That's it.

06:12.071 --> 06:15.507
That was very moving,
Mr. Firpo.

06:15.575 --> 06:20.672
But the prison psychiatry board says
you're incapable of telling the truth.

06:20.747 --> 06:22.942
Well, that's a lie.

06:30.156 --> 06:35.321
Alvin Firpo.
You have been labeled a kleptomaniac.

06:38.765 --> 06:41.029
<i>Alvin!</i>

06:41.100 --> 06:43.864
Are you all right, Mr. Firpo?

06:43.936 --> 06:47.303
Okay. How you guys doin'?

06:47.373 --> 06:49.603
My name's Alvin Firpo.

06:49.675 --> 06:54.669
And what I've learned in prison is that
robbin' and stealin' and all that horseshit--

06:54.747 --> 06:57.739
<i>There's somethin'that ain't right
about it. You know what I mean?</i>

06:57.817 --> 07:01.344
A lot of guys in here disagree with me,
but they're servin' time.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.823
I'm up for parole. Connect the dots.
Connect 'em.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.383
- So long, fellas.
- So long!

07:08.494 --> 07:11.156
- Yeah!

07:11.230 --> 07:13.221
- Fresh air!
- Yes, sir.

07:13.299 --> 07:17.167
- So long, Jerry.
- Bye, boys.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.431
So long,Jerry. Take it easy.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.099
- Smiley. Smiley, I'm gonna miss ya.
- Yeah, right.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.735
- Do me a favor. Get yourself something nice. All right.
- Thank you.

07:24.811 --> 07:27.075
- Enjoy it, Smiley.
- You stay out of trouble.

07:27.146 --> 07:31.378
- Hey, Bill! How are ya?
- All right. Let's start this off on the right foot.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.817
Whatever it is,
the answer's no.

07:33.886 --> 07:36.946
''No''?
''No'' what? What are you talking about?

07:37.056 --> 07:39.991
Whatever it is that
you want me to do, the answer's no.

07:40.059 --> 07:42.493
- Does that apply to me too, Bill?
- No. I got no beef with you.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.496
- You sure?
- Yes.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.998
- 'Cause I wouldn't want you to be pissed at me.
- No. You're fine.

07:47.066 --> 07:49.694
- Really? There's no problem between us?
- There's startin' to be.

07:49.769 --> 07:54.832
- Well, it's nice to see you too.
- All right. Let's go see Ma.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.808
Hey, Alvin. I heard the economy
was in the shithouse.

07:57.877 --> 08:01.313
- I had no idea.
Look at that abandoned car.

08:01.380 --> 08:03.814
- It's my car. - What
the-- - Oh. Sorry.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.851
It's, uh-- It's nice.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.978
You gotta be kiddin'!

08:11.090 --> 08:13.752
- Boy, I bet the space shuttle
makes less noise.

08:13.860 --> 08:17.227
- Hey, Alvin. I never seen
stalactites in a car before.

08:17.296 --> 08:19.423
Stalactites!

08:19.499 --> 08:22.525
I can see
nothing's changed.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.662
Yeah, nothin's changed,
huh, Dave?

08:29.809 --> 08:32.039
- Alvin, we're free.
- That's right. Free as a bird.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.602
Hey, Bill, you think this crate
could make it to Pennsylvania?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.706
I got this friend in prison.
He's practically on his deathbed.

08:37.783 --> 08:42.220
He asked me to do him this favor. He
gave me a letter explaining everything.

08:42.321 --> 08:44.380
Here.
You gotta read this.

08:44.490 --> 08:46.515
<i>It'll make you cry.</i>

08:50.162 --> 08:52.096
I detect resistance.

08:54.000 --> 08:59.495
I knew you'd react like that. That's why
I got another copy for your future perusal.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.507
You two are on parole. You cannot leave
the state. You are in my custody.

09:02.575 --> 09:07.069
You cannot go. So just quiet down,
my little one, and call me Dad.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.444
Hey, Dad.

09:09.515 --> 09:12.313
Can we stop and get
some Ring Dings and milk?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.649
<i>- Ring Dings and milk?
- Ring Dings and milk!</i>

09:14.720 --> 09:17.883
Oh, yeah! Then we can get some balloons,
and we can go to the puppet show.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.858
<i>- What are you, two years old?
- Oh, well pardonez-moi.</i>

09:21.928 --> 09:25.455
We're not all fancy,
upscale restaurateurs like you, Bill.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.932
Fine, fine. Then we'll get some Ring
Dings and milk for the child in the back.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.935
- Heh heh!
- Yummy, yummy.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.352
Shit!

09:49.722 --> 09:52.953
<i>Idiot!</i>

09:56.395 --> 09:59.455
Come here!

09:59.532 --> 10:01.796
- Hey!
- What's the problem?

10:01.867 --> 10:04.028
Come on, l--
What are you--

10:04.103 --> 10:08.802
- No, no! It's all right!
Put the money back!

10:23.122 --> 10:25.818
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

10:25.925 --> 10:29.053
<i>Policia! Policia!</i>

10:32.465 --> 10:35.366
Get your hand
out of your pocket!

10:37.503 --> 10:40.836
Son of a bitch! I'm not with you five
minutes, and I'm being chased by cops!

10:50.983 --> 10:54.077
Come here!
Up against the wall!

10:54.153 --> 10:56.644
Come here!
Come on! Come on!

10:56.756 --> 10:59.589
Get up against the wall!
Get up against the wall!

11:01.060 --> 11:03.858
<i>- Come on!
- Freeze, goddamn it! I'll shoot!</i>

11:03.929 --> 11:07.092
Sergeant Dickman, off duty, Queens!
What is your name, rookie?

11:07.166 --> 11:11.193
- Birdie.
- I got the mayor up my ass on account of punks like you!

11:11.270 --> 11:15.366
- So stop jackin' off, get the car and pick up this scum!
- Okay.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.500
- Move!
- Yes, sir!

11:26.686 --> 11:30.053
<i>You know, Bill, there are
8,000,000 stories in the naked city.</i>

11:30.156 --> 11:33.614
- Not all of them revolve around you.
- Come on. Don't hold back, Ma.

11:33.726 --> 11:37.025
That's cream corn. Look at that stuff.
One more. Come on. That's delicious.

11:37.096 --> 11:42.432
Can't beat it with a stick. Thank you.
Yeah, warm me up. It's great to be home, Ma.

11:42.501 --> 11:45.163
- I miss this little piece of heaven.
- Yeah. I missed you, Ma.

11:45.237 --> 11:48.673
I missed you boys too.

11:48.741 --> 11:51.733
You know what else
I miss around here?

11:51.811 --> 11:56.145
<i>I miss all the creature comforts we used
to have when you boys were around--</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:59.048
VCRs, big-screen TVs.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.052
- You remember?
- Yeah.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.954
Boy, you could hardly move in here.

12:05.057 --> 12:08.288
Hardly move! Big-screen TV!

12:08.360 --> 12:12.160
Yeah, I wonder who misses them more--
you or the original owners.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.530
Aw, baloney. Are you sayin'
that stuff was stolen?

12:15.601 --> 12:18.263
No, Ma. Dave and Alvin
would never steal anything.

12:18.337 --> 12:21.101
They're saints.
That car wash robbed itself.

12:21.173 --> 12:23.539
We were at the park
all day.

12:23.609 --> 12:28.546
They didn't have a shred of evidence,
'cept for our fingerprints.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.242
What's this?

12:31.317 --> 12:35.083
Oh. You don't wanna read that, Ma.
That's a real heartbreaker.

12:35.154 --> 12:38.453
<i>- Yeah, Ma. That's wicked bad.
- Mm.</i>

12:38.557 --> 12:44.325
''Dear Dave and Alvin. It's been five
years since I've seen my daughter.

12:44.396 --> 12:48.492
As I told you before,
she refuses to visit me here.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.968
<i>I'm gettin'old,
and I can't stand the thought...</i>

12:52.037 --> 12:54.130
of another Christmas...

12:56.375 --> 12:58.673
going by without seeing her.

12:59.912 --> 13:02.244
Her name is Sarah...

13:02.314 --> 13:06.273
and she's the only thing in the world
that means anything...

13:06.352 --> 13:08.343
to me.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.980
<i>I know I'm askin'a lot...</i>

13:11.090 --> 13:15.424
but I would like for you to look her
up in that town I mentioned to you...

13:15.494 --> 13:17.962
Paradise, Pennsylvania...

13:18.063 --> 13:21.658
<i>and beg her
to come see me.</i>

13:26.505 --> 13:30.965
I know bein' on parole, you're not
supposed to leave the state.

13:31.043 --> 13:36.046
But you two bastards owe me
for all the shit I've done for you...

13:36.081 --> 13:40.142
<i>and if you don't do it, I promise I will
somehow escape from this place...</i>

13:40.219 --> 13:43.711
track you down like dogs...

13:43.789 --> 13:48.658
rip off your heads
and shit down your throats.

13:48.761 --> 13:51.662
All my love
this holiday season...

13:51.730 --> 13:54.699
Vic Mazzucci.''

13:54.767 --> 13:57.235
Bravo. Oh, come on!

13:57.303 --> 13:59.931
I gotta get out
of this loony bin.

14:00.072 --> 14:02.540
How can you ignore a man like this?

14:02.608 --> 14:06.339
Ma, I'm sure he's the nicest killer on ''C''
block, but I really got to get to work.

14:06.412 --> 14:09.904
Look, has anybody seen my wallet?

14:09.982 --> 14:12.746
If your head wasn't
screwed on--

14:12.818 --> 14:14.877
Fine. I'm leaving.

14:14.954 --> 14:20.153
- Good evening. May I assist you with your specials tonight?
- Yes, waiter.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.854
Actually, I'm the,
uh, the manager.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.294
- What exactly is in the bouillabaisse?
- I'll call you back.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.389
Well, it's a variety
of things, actually.

14:27.499 --> 14:31.196
It's a splendid array of fish,
shellfish, garlic, paprika--

14:31.270 --> 14:33.795
Hey! Is my brother
doin' a great job?

14:33.873 --> 14:36.068
Oh, we're
very proud of him.

14:36.141 --> 14:40.043
Would you please, uh-- Would you
please excuse me for a moment?

14:40.112 --> 14:43.047
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to save your life!

14:43.115 --> 14:45.675
- You gotta get out of here. This
is where I work. - Yeah, but--

14:45.751 --> 14:48.845
This is where I work. Do not come
down here and screw things up, okay?

14:48.921 --> 14:51.185
Whatever it is,
we'll talk about it at home.

14:51.257 --> 14:53.521
<i>You don't understand. You can't go home.</i>

14:53.592 --> 14:56.288
Holy shit!
They're here already.

14:56.395 --> 14:59.523
Hm. Well, we gotta give these cops
one thing, they're efficient.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.567
- What are you talking about?
- Your wallet!

15:02.635 --> 15:06.036
- You dropped your wallet at the
scene of the crime in the Bronx.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.801
- The cops were at the house. They're
askin' Ma questions. - Cops-- Did Ma--

15:08.874 --> 15:11.104
- That's right! I'm here
to rescue you. Calm down.

15:11.176 --> 15:13.610
- Me and Alvin borrowed a car. Let's go.
- Okay.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.740
<i>Hey! Come on! Let's go!</i>

15:17.816 --> 15:20.512
- Come on! Run!
- Hurry up!

15:20.586 --> 15:22.884
Let's get outta here!

15:22.955 --> 15:27.153
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.797
What's going on at the house?
Yeah.

15:42.808 --> 15:44.833
What? You're kiddin'!

15:44.910 --> 15:49.347
<i>Oh, no. You think we should
stay out of New York altogether?</i>

15:49.415 --> 15:51.975
Ma, it's Christmas Eve,
and we're--

15:52.051 --> 15:56.283
Yeah, well, we're in New Jersey now.
That's not far enough away?

15:56.355 --> 16:01.122
<i>Yeah, but, Ma, we want to come home.
It's Chri-- Yeah, but we--</i>

16:03.963 --> 16:06.989
All right. All right.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.966
Yeah. I love you too.
All right.

16:11.236 --> 16:14.034
Here, Bill.
I got you this.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.973
Something to read.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.442
Take your mind
off of things.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.743
Can I play--
Hm?

16:23.816 --> 16:26.808
<i>Listen, I got more bad news.
Ma says the cops are at the house.</i>

16:26.885 --> 16:28.944
<i>They'rejust
drivin'her nuts.</i>

16:29.021 --> 16:33.685
Maybe we can go to Pennsylvania, and Alvin
and I could do that favor for our friend...

16:33.759 --> 16:36.751
<i>- and his daughter.
- What I'd like to do...</i>

16:36.829 --> 16:41.095
is go back home.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.363
<i>You know, Bill, maybe if we did
something for somebody else...</i>

16:44.436 --> 16:47.405
it'd have a way of
coming back around for us.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.374
- You set me up.
- What?

16:51.443 --> 16:56.938
Is this, uh-- Is this one of your
elaborate schemes?

16:56.982 --> 16:59.576
<i>- Oh, come on. Now, would I do that to you?
- Dave...</i>

17:01.587 --> 17:04.351
I know how
your mind works.

17:04.423 --> 17:07.950
You know exactly
what you're doin'...

17:08.060 --> 17:12.588
and the whole time...
you stand there...

17:12.698 --> 17:14.858
<i>with this ''Who, me?''...</i>

17:14.967 --> 17:19.733
expression...
on your face!

17:21.373 --> 17:23.364
You're doing it right now.

17:25.810 --> 17:29.804
All right. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.544
Alvin, is it me?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.609
Move!

17:59.545 --> 18:03.481
Look, guys...
I'm a sport. I'm here.

18:03.549 --> 18:07.178
You know, and so...
do me a favor.

18:07.252 --> 18:11.313
- Let's try to keep this as inconspicuous as possible.
- Oh, absolutely.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.296
Timmy!

18:30.075 --> 18:32.339
Merlin, are you okay?

18:32.411 --> 18:36.871
- Easy, Merlin. Easy. Easy.
- Very nice, very nice. Another cop.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.180
<i>All right. Let me through there.
Timmy, what happened?</i>

18:40.252 --> 18:42.743
- I fell, Dad.
- Are you hurt?

18:42.821 --> 18:45.483
I'm all right, Dad.
How about Merlin?

18:45.557 --> 18:47.548
Merlin's fine.
Merlin's fine.

18:47.659 --> 18:50.958
Hey, I'm real sorry, you know. It's just
that, uh, he rode right out in front of us.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.054
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

18:53.165 --> 18:55.133
- Is he retarded?
- Yeah.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.702
Come here a second.

18:59.471 --> 19:04.704
Look. My boy's a little slow.
You understand?

19:04.776 --> 19:06.971
<i>- I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
- Anybody hurt?</i>

19:07.045 --> 19:09.309
- No. Everybody's fine, Father Gorenzel.
- Oh, good.

19:09.381 --> 19:12.441
<i>- That'd be no way to start Christmas Eve.
- Heh! Right.</i>

19:12.518 --> 19:17.785
<i>All right. Back up, everybody. Just go on with
your business. There's nothing here to watch.</i>

19:17.856 --> 19:21.815
Thanks. Thanks very much. Thank you.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, boys.

19:21.927 --> 19:26.387
<i>- Is there anything I can do to help you?
- Uh, no. I don't think so.</i>

19:26.498 --> 19:28.989
What are you here for,
the Winterfest?

19:29.101 --> 19:32.434
Yeah, that and we're
looking for a Sarah Mazzucci.

19:32.504 --> 19:36.838
Mazzucci? I don't think there's anybody
by the name of Sarah Mazzucci in this town.

19:36.909 --> 19:40.606
As a matter of fact, the only Sarah
I know is a Sarah Collins.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.671
- She works right there.
- Where?

19:43.749 --> 19:46.582
- Right there. Heh!
- Oh.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.485
<i>The town bank.</i>

19:49.555 --> 19:52.490
- Imagine that.
- Yeah. Imagine that.

19:52.558 --> 19:57.586
Well, if you get your car out of the way, we'll
get the traffic movin'. See ya later. Thank you.

19:57.696 --> 20:01.325
- Well, let's go check it out.
- He just said her name was Collins.

20:01.433 --> 20:05.164
Maybe she got married.

20:28.794 --> 20:31.285
Where could she be?
Where could she be?

21:16.275 --> 21:19.472
Wait a minute.
Hold up. Excuse me.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.978
Those are for
the children.

21:22.047 --> 21:26.177
- And the sign says ''Take a pen,'' not ''Take all the pens.''
- Oh.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.776
- Can I have 'em back?
- The pen-- It said, ''Take''--

21:28.854 --> 21:30.845
- Come on.
- Oh.

21:30.922 --> 21:34.323
- It said on the sign--
- All of them. All of them.

21:34.393 --> 21:38.352
- Give 'em up.
- It said-- It said--

21:40.198 --> 21:42.666
Are you all right?

21:44.469 --> 21:48.132
Okay. Okay.

21:48.206 --> 21:51.539
Sarah, honey.
All the pens are gone.

21:51.610 --> 21:55.671
<i>- Yeah, I know. I have them
right here, Mr. Anderson.</i>

21:55.747 --> 21:58.716
- New customer?
- Heh heh!

22:00.352 --> 22:03.014
Sarah?

22:03.088 --> 22:05.886
- Sarah Collins?
- Yeah?

22:05.957 --> 22:08.949
- Are you married?
- Why? Are you gonna propose?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.222
Yes.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.992
Do I know you?

22:16.468 --> 22:21.735
No. I'm Bill. I apologize for my brother.
He's, uh--

22:22.808 --> 22:26.869
Ohh... mentally retarded.

22:26.945 --> 22:31.848
You know, he's a diabetic, and we were
afraid he was gonna go into insulin shock.

22:31.917 --> 22:34.750
I said, ''Hey, why don't you
go and find yourself...

22:34.820 --> 22:37.414
something sweet?''

22:39.424 --> 22:41.858
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yes. It was nice meeting you...

22:41.960 --> 22:44.929
- Nice meeting you. Very nice, Sarah.
- Sarah.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.202
Wrong Sarah?

22:51.303 --> 22:54.795
Well, I guess that just depends
on how you look at it, doesn't it?

22:54.873 --> 22:56.864
Yeah.

22:56.942 --> 23:01.470
Hey, Bill, don't you just love this
old, classic architecture?

23:01.546 --> 23:03.844
Forget it.

23:03.915 --> 23:08.784
- Forget what?
- I got eyes. I know you. Forget it.

23:08.854 --> 23:12.790
One, I ain't doin' it,
no matter how good it looks.

23:12.858 --> 23:16.055
And two, there's no money
in the vault.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.801
- And what have we here?
- $275,000.

23:29.875 --> 23:34.039
<i>- Would you mind signing here,
Mr. Anderson?</i>

23:34.112 --> 23:36.103
You all right?

23:36.181 --> 23:38.308
<i>See you, boys.</i>

23:38.383 --> 23:40.374
Alvin, come on.

23:40.452 --> 23:42.716
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night, sir.

23:42.788 --> 23:45.086
Where the hell are we going
in such a hurry?

23:45.157 --> 23:47.523
It doesn't matter.
Just get us out of here.

23:47.592 --> 23:49.924
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

23:50.028 --> 23:52.462
Yeah.

23:52.531 --> 23:55.694
I'm telling you, if I had a gun
on me right now...

23:55.767 --> 23:58.861
I'd go in that bank
and take that place over.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.663
Say, Bill.

24:02.741 --> 24:07.440
Would you be terribly upset with me
if I were to tell you...

24:07.512 --> 24:11.243
that there may
possibly be guns...

24:11.316 --> 24:14.615
- in the trunk?
- Alvin, pull the car over.

24:14.686 --> 24:17.246
- What?
- Pull it over!

24:17.322 --> 24:19.654
All right, all right, all right! Easy!

24:27.299 --> 24:29.631
All right.
Get out of the car.

24:32.237 --> 24:34.296
Come on.

24:36.341 --> 24:38.468
- Get out.
- All right, all right.

24:40.145 --> 24:43.876
What is your problem?

24:43.949 --> 24:46.645
<i>There's guns in the trunk,
and I got a problem?</i>

24:46.718 --> 24:49.346
- Hey, I borrowed the car from Fast Eddie.
- Who the hell is Fast Eddie?

24:49.421 --> 24:53.983
- He owns the gun shop on Morris Park Avenue.
- Oh, terrific.

24:54.059 --> 24:56.687
So chances are,
there's an arsenal back there.

24:56.795 --> 25:00.287
- There's probably a couple of
shotguns and.45s. - Oh. Uh-huh.

25:00.398 --> 25:03.993
But you haven't actually
seen these guns, have you, Dave.

25:04.069 --> 25:07.732
- No. No,just an assumption.
- No, we haven't seen--

25:09.374 --> 25:11.842
<i>Oh, my God! Guns!</i>

25:14.112 --> 25:16.279
Big surprise, huh?

25:20.252 --> 25:22.948
<i>- Which way do you think the mouse is headed?</i>

26:05.964 --> 26:07.955
Hmm.

26:33.558 --> 26:37.494
You idiot! We're about to rob a bank, and
you're gonna get us pinched for stealin' hats?

26:37.562 --> 26:39.587
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

26:39.664 --> 26:44.328
- What?
- I was-- I was--

26:46.037 --> 26:50.064
- I was-- - You gotta be
kidding me? What are you doing?

26:50.141 --> 26:54.009
<i>Hmm. What?</i>

26:54.112 --> 26:56.137
I can't even--

27:08.259 --> 27:11.524
Oh, and, uh,
however much these cost.

27:19.204 --> 27:22.731
Would you quit hoverin'
'round me like bad news?

27:22.807 --> 27:27.176
- What do you want me to do?
- Bag this stuff.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.576
- All of it?
- No.

27:29.681 --> 27:33.082
Just what you haven't become
emotionally attached to.

27:33.151 --> 27:36.848
Oh, Christ on a crooked crutch!
Get out of the way!

27:38.523 --> 27:41.390
You boys here
for the Winterfest?

27:41.459 --> 27:45.054
No, we're just--
we're just passin' through.

27:45.130 --> 27:46.961
- Just passin' through?

27:47.032 --> 27:51.128
- Just passin' through!
- Passin'.

28:11.823 --> 28:15.190
- Whoa! Don't shut it off.
- What?

28:15.260 --> 28:17.524
We won't have time
to hot-wire it again.

28:17.595 --> 28:21.087
Bill, you do what you do,
and I do what I do.

28:21.166 --> 28:25.159
That enhances
my sense of security.

28:29.708 --> 28:31.972
All right.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.568
All right. Let's do it!

28:44.055 --> 28:47.889
<i>All right! This is a goddamn robbery!</i>

28:47.959 --> 28:50.689
<i>- Do not move!
- Get your hands up now!</i>

28:50.762 --> 28:54.391
- Do not move!
- Get 'em up! Get away from that phone! Get 'em up!

28:54.466 --> 28:58.630
<i>Who is talking? Who is talking?</i>

28:58.703 --> 29:03.367
<i>Do you boys really,
um-- Do you boys really want to do this?</i>

29:03.441 --> 29:05.966
<i>- Do what?
- Wha-- Um--</i>

29:07.712 --> 29:10.647
Heh! You know...
rob the bank.

29:10.715 --> 29:14.913
Absolutely! We have thought this over,
and this is the thing to do!

29:14.986 --> 29:20.049
- Keep 'em up!
- But-But on-on Christmas Eve? l-- Eh-Eh--

29:20.125 --> 29:24.824
It doesn't seem right, don't you think?
You're going to ruin the Winterfest.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.891
The Winterfest?

29:29.968 --> 29:34.234
I have a gun... and you're talkin'
about the Winterfest?

29:34.305 --> 29:36.296
<i>Well, who are you?</i>

29:36.374 --> 29:40.936
<i>- I'm married to Mr. Anderson...
- Ooh, lucky him.</i>

29:41.045 --> 29:44.071
the president
of the bank.

29:44.182 --> 29:49.245
l-- Eh-- The bank vault is closed
right now. It's locked.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.120
l- It's locked? All right!
Who's got the key? Raise your hand!

29:53.191 --> 29:56.820
Rai-- Oh.

29:56.895 --> 30:01.696
All right. Lower your hands.
Who's got a key? Raise your hand.

30:01.766 --> 30:04.701
You got-- No? All right.
Raise your hands.

30:04.769 --> 30:09.468
- Key! Key!
- All right, you fashion queen. Who's got the key?

30:09.541 --> 30:13.136
- My husband is the only one
with the key. - Ke-e-ey! Key!

30:13.244 --> 30:18.477
My husband is the only one with a key,
and I'm afraid he's out to lunch right now.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.609
Well, when's he get back?

30:20.718 --> 30:24.984
Oh, about, um...
45 minutes.

30:25.056 --> 30:29.823
Okay! Nobody move! Keep your hands up!
Stay away from the phones!

30:31.663 --> 30:34.223
Forty-five minutes
ain't bad.

30:34.299 --> 30:38.326
- You need a lobotomy.
- Don't get nasty with me.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.463
- It was just a suggestion.
- Uh-- Eh--

30:41.539 --> 30:44.667
- I'm gonna get ya. I'm comin' at ya.
- Oh, oh, oh.

30:44.742 --> 30:48.200
Mrs. Anderson.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.575
- And gotcha!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.654
I'm coming, I'm coming.

30:58.122 --> 31:01.455
- Keep 'em up!
- Where are you going?

31:01.526 --> 31:04.689
- I'm going with you to get the key.
- No! You stay here!

31:04.762 --> 31:07.060
Don't you two
fall in love.

31:09.033 --> 31:11.194
You heard him!
I'm staying here!

31:15.106 --> 31:18.075
You do what you do,
and I do what I do.

31:18.142 --> 31:21.168
Over there in the--
in the coffee shop.

31:21.279 --> 31:24.248
- Ooh!

31:25.283 --> 31:28.047
Huh? What? What?

31:28.119 --> 31:32.522
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?
We done yet? 'Cause I'm starvin'.

31:32.590 --> 31:36.048
Vault's locked. Gotta get a key. Bank
president's in there having lunch. Let's go.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.118
Oh, lunch. Good.

31:38.196 --> 31:43.930
Everybody, nothin's gonna happen.
Keep your hands up and relax.

31:44.002 --> 31:46.232
<i>What are you lookin'at?</i>

31:46.304 --> 31:49.603
Look, let's sing a song.
All right? It's Christmas.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.772
- Where is he?
- That's him in the back.

32:02.887 --> 32:05.583
<i>- Come on!
- Oh,you can't get to heaven</i>

32:11.696 --> 32:16.224
That's right. Feel better?

32:20.338 --> 32:22.670
Sorry. I'm sorry.

32:22.740 --> 32:26.267
Mr. Anderson?

32:26.377 --> 32:29.778
<i>- I'll bring him over to the house if it's all right.
- That would be nice.</i>

32:29.847 --> 32:32.145
<i>Has he got a friend
he wants to bring?</i>

32:35.019 --> 32:38.318
Nobody move, goddamn it!
This is a robbery!

32:38.389 --> 32:41.654
It's a robbery! It's a robbery!
It's a robbery!

32:41.726 --> 32:43.626
<i>Shh!</i>

32:43.695 --> 32:46.323
Where are you going?

32:48.566 --> 32:51.433
l-- It's a robbery.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.266
I'm going to get you money
out of the cash register.

32:54.339 --> 32:56.466
I'm robbing the bank!

32:58.776 --> 33:01.973
Well, the bank...
is across the street.

33:02.080 --> 33:04.378
I know the bank
is across the street.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.850
I need to get Mr. Anderson
over there to open up the vault!

33:07.919 --> 33:10.615
Could you hold this
for a second?

33:10.688 --> 33:15.853
Could ya? Thank you so much. All right.
That looks tasty. A little salt never hurt.

33:15.927 --> 33:18.327
- Yum, yum.
- What are you doing?

33:18.396 --> 33:21.331
- I'm eatin' scrapple.
- Don't touch any of that! We're gettin' out of here!

33:21.399 --> 33:24.527
- It's got scallions.
- Get your hands up!

33:26.671 --> 33:29.196
Well, well.

33:29.273 --> 33:34.540
Somebody got their Christmas bonus early.
What do you think he did? Drink it?

33:34.645 --> 33:36.840
Hey, you're not gonna leave
all these people here, are ya?

33:36.948 --> 33:40.213
I mean, any one of them will call
the cops the second we're outta here.

33:51.429 --> 33:55.627
And breathe... and let it out.

33:55.700 --> 33:59.192
Good, good. It's just your basic yoga.
I learned it in prison.

33:59.270 --> 34:02.603
It's good for tense situations like this--
robbery-- or if you ever do go to prison.

34:02.673 --> 34:05.972
You're surrounded by 10 men.
Helps to relax you.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.648
We're just gonna take the money,
believe me. No one's gonna get hurt.

34:11.748 --> 34:16.550
- We only want your cash.
- Move forward. Move forward. Go in. Move forward.

34:16.621 --> 34:18.714
Everybody come in.
Keep your hands up.

34:18.790 --> 34:22.954
Anybody who moves will get shot,
as will the person next to you.

34:23.027 --> 34:24.960
The two-for-one thing.

34:25.029 --> 34:28.226
<i>- I just got through relaxin' 'em. You're makin' 'em all panic.
- You stay here!</i>

34:28.299 --> 34:31.359
<i>- All right. Get in. Just keep your hands up.
- Open the door.</i>

34:31.436 --> 34:35.065
So it's ground beef-cheese-scallion
scrapple.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.733
Heh heh! Thanks a lot.

34:37.809 --> 34:41.301
All right. Come on. Let's go.
Keep your hands up. Move.

34:41.411 --> 34:43.539
You bring the whole town?

34:44.882 --> 34:46.907
<i>Move forward.</i>

34:48.286 --> 34:50.880
<i>- Go forward. There's plenty of space.
- It's okay.</i>

34:50.955 --> 34:52.946
- Move!
- I'm mov--

34:53.024 --> 34:55.822
<i>- Who here, this is their
first robbery? Raise your hand.</i>

34:55.893 --> 34:59.260
<i>- Back off!.Come on.
- Yeah, you? First one?</i>

34:59.330 --> 35:02.060
Come on! Back off.
Okay. Back away. Back away!

35:02.133 --> 35:05.364
All right, now. This is just a robbery.
No one will get hurt.

35:05.436 --> 35:10.339
For those of you just joining us, keep your
hands up. We were doing a little yoga earlier.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.900
<i>I see there's some people
still shaking. Let's breathe in.</i>

35:14.011 --> 35:16.104
- We're all right.
Just stay out of their way.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.205
<i>And out.</i>

35:19.584 --> 35:23.213
<i>Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
Raise your hand.</i>

35:23.287 --> 35:28.224
<i>Huh! Tough! We'll be
done here very shortly.</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:32.991
<i>This is something you will be able to
take home with you after this robbery--</i>

35:33.064 --> 35:37.262
<i>A little exercise, which it looks like
some of you could use. All right?</i>

35:37.335 --> 35:39.633
So, let's breathe in.

35:39.704 --> 35:41.831
Breath in. Good. Hold it.
And let it out.

35:41.906 --> 35:45.307
Good. And one more deep breath in.

35:45.376 --> 35:49.107
<i>Everybody. And let it out. Good.</i>

35:49.213 --> 35:51.010
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

35:51.082 --> 35:54.415
Shit!
All right, back away!

35:54.485 --> 35:56.851
<i>Everyone,
keep your hands up!</i>

36:04.595 --> 36:09.123
<i>- I'm Alvin Firpo, Officer.
I was just here...</i>

36:09.200 --> 36:11.794
waiting to see when the meter ran out.

36:16.974 --> 36:19.568
Where's he goin'?

36:26.317 --> 36:29.343
Aw, g'wan,
ya sons of bitches!

36:29.453 --> 36:32.149
- You want a piece of this? Come on!
- Oof!.

36:32.223 --> 36:35.215
- Come on. Come on.
- Kiss my ass.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.727
Damn!

36:37.795 --> 36:39.990
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

36:41.332 --> 36:45.268
- Holy skunk! Yeah,
you! - What? - Go!

36:49.307 --> 36:52.470
- Hey!
- Alvin!

36:54.245 --> 36:56.543
Is he gonna do it again?
Is he gonna do it again?

37:01.285 --> 37:04.686
- Well, didn't go out of your way, did ya?
- You're here, ain't ya?

37:56.874 --> 37:59.172
<i>What's that?</i>

37:59.243 --> 38:02.838
Oh, shit. I still got the keys
to the vault on me.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.418
Same time next year.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.221
Hey, Mazzucci.
Tell us about that bank you broke into.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.991
- I'm tired of tellin' that story.
- Aw, Victor, come on.

38:20.064 --> 38:22.498
- All right, all right.
- Tell it nice and slow.

38:22.566 --> 38:27.367
Okay. This bank is like
a beautiful orchard.

38:27.438 --> 38:29.929
Only instead of fruit,
there's money ripening on the vine.

38:30.007 --> 38:34.034
- It's just waiting to be picked.
- I love the way he tells this story.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.637
No camera, and the security guard,
he's older than water.

38:37.748 --> 38:41.115
- Oh, this can't be true!
- Vic, what are we doin' in this joint?

38:41.185 --> 38:44.882
<i>Ooh! Ain't you worried
about talkin'here?</i>

38:44.955 --> 38:47.924
- What if somebody beat ya to the punch?
- Are you crazy?

38:47.992 --> 38:52.088
Who's gonna double-cross him? He's
buried more people than Forest Lawn!

38:56.267 --> 38:59.361
Vic, you know that bank job
you guys are always talking about?

38:59.437 --> 39:02.304
- Yeah. What about it?
- Was it in Pennsylvania?

39:02.373 --> 39:06.002
- Yeah. Yeah. Why?
- Paradise? It just got robbed. Came over the TV.

39:06.077 --> 39:09.205
<i>Hey, Vic. Isn't that where
your daughter Sarah works?</i>

39:09.313 --> 39:13.044
<i>Do you think those Firpo brothers had
anything to do with it? Those rat bastards.</i>

39:14.085 --> 39:16.144
<i>Vic?</i>

39:16.253 --> 39:20.485
<i>Aagh!</i>

39:29.934 --> 39:32.459
Welcome to Paradise,
gentlemen.

39:32.570 --> 39:35.266
Agent Peyser, sir.

39:35.339 --> 39:38.035
- Right this way.
- I want agents at every roadblock.

39:38.109 --> 39:40.202
- I don't trust these local cops.
- Okay.

39:40.277 --> 39:42.711
I don't care what their story is.
Everybody everywhere is a suspect.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.873
- You got it.
- Got it.

39:44.949 --> 39:48.214
- Hi. I'm Chief Burnell.
- Special Agent Peyser.

39:48.285 --> 39:51.743
- Yeah. This is my son. He's Deputy Timmy Burnell.
- Okay. Okay.

39:51.822 --> 39:54.552
- Hi!
- Hi.

39:54.625 --> 39:58.425
Move back, please.

39:58.496 --> 40:00.987
Move it! Move it.

40:01.065 --> 40:03.499
- Whoo!
- The first thing I want to know--

40:03.567 --> 40:06.001
Do think this bank
was hit by locals or outsiders?

40:06.070 --> 40:09.198
I can't really say, but we've never had
a problem like this before.

40:09.273 --> 40:11.833
I can't really believe
it would be anybody from town.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.673
- Anybody suspicious around before
the bank was robbed? - Oh, well--

40:14.745 --> 40:17.407
- Jesus Christ, Bernie. What the hell's goin' on?
- Hi, Ed. How ya doin'?

40:17.481 --> 40:21.508
I tell ya, this town is crawlin' with
tourists. That's 'cause of our Winterfest.

40:21.585 --> 40:25.715
Your guess is probably as good as mine. But
there was three guys in town this morning.

40:25.790 --> 40:28.088
Yeah.
Nearly run over my kid.

40:28.159 --> 40:32.493
- I've never seen 'em before.
- This way. Watch your step.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.554
It's right through here.

40:34.665 --> 40:36.895
What kind of car was it?

40:37.001 --> 40:39.265
- Ah, an Infinity.
- Merry Christmas, Gentlemen.

40:39.336 --> 40:42.430
- Merry Christmas.
- The snow came down pretty fast.

40:42.506 --> 40:45.373
Hopefully they're still in the area.
Put out an A.P.B. on that car.

40:45.443 --> 40:50.471
- I've already done that.
- Good. Well, with any luck, we ought to be able to find 'em...

40:50.548 --> 40:53.278
especially if
they're heading north.

40:53.350 --> 40:55.409
Alvin.

40:57.688 --> 40:59.952
What?

41:00.057 --> 41:02.082
Where are we headed?

41:03.894 --> 41:05.953
North.

41:07.898 --> 41:12.597
<i>- How do you know?
- I swear we passed that farmhouse before.</i>

41:12.670 --> 41:16.231
Right. Oh, no. All those farm houses,
they look alike.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.470
Alvin, if we're going around in circles,
I'm gonna break your neck.

41:19.543 --> 41:22.103
I just did
what the map said. I made four lefts.

41:22.179 --> 41:25.637
Four lefts is a circle, you idiot!

41:25.716 --> 41:28.913
Are you sure?

41:28.986 --> 41:33.548
- Oh, state trooper. Oh, shit! Shit!
- All right! Relax, relax.

41:33.624 --> 41:36.991
<i>- Don't make eye contact.
- He's turning around.</i>

41:37.061 --> 41:40.224
- We're just three guys drivin' down the road in a blizzard.
- All right.

41:40.331 --> 41:44.791
Nothin' to get nervous about. All right?

41:47.771 --> 41:50.035
<i>He's comin'after us.</i>

41:50.107 --> 41:54.601
- Oh, no, no, no, no. He's gaining on us.
- Just relax.

41:54.678 --> 41:57.272
<i>- Yes. - What?
- I see it.</i>

41:57.348 --> 42:00.215
- He's gaining on us.
- Who cares? Alvin, step on it!

42:00.284 --> 42:04.812
- I don't have any snow chains.
- The cop is comin' after us. The cop is comin' after us!

42:04.889 --> 42:06.982
Are you out of your mind?
Go!

42:09.059 --> 42:11.994
- Hurry up!
- Just be cool. Lay back.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.119
Ow!

42:45.796 --> 42:47.855
Oh, Ow!

42:49.333 --> 42:52.825
Ooh! That hurt.

42:52.937 --> 42:56.896
<i>- Oww!
- You all right?</i>

42:57.007 --> 42:59.942
Eh, I didn't have
snow chains.

43:00.077 --> 43:03.513
- You have no brain either.
- Hey! You guys all right?

43:03.581 --> 43:07.142
- Who the hell is that?
- You just shut up, and let me do the talking.

43:10.087 --> 43:13.079
- Wha-- What happened?
- Our car ran off the road.

43:13.157 --> 43:17.287
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Well, we're not dead, if that's what you mean.

43:17.361 --> 43:21.491
- Didn't have snow chains!
- Look, you guys are gonna freeze out here.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.625
- You better get in my car fast!
- Can you take us to the interstate?

43:24.735 --> 43:27.727
<i>No! No, the roads to
the interstate are closed.</i>

43:27.838 --> 43:31.103
- Can you take us anywhere?
- You're gonna be singing at my aunt and uncle's soon.

43:31.175 --> 43:33.541
You may as well
brush up here, okay?

44:09.179 --> 44:11.147
- Dick!
- Uncle Cliff.

44:11.215 --> 44:14.309
- Aah! Oh.
- Oh, you okay?

44:14.385 --> 44:16.444
I'm sorry.
I just stubbed my toe.

44:16.520 --> 44:19.717
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sorry it took me so long getting here.

44:19.790 --> 44:22.554
<i>This is Bill,
Dave and Alvin Firpo.</i>

44:27.464 --> 44:31.764
Gee, Ed. Those were the guys
that were in our store, aren't they?

44:31.835 --> 44:35.703
By God, Clovis,
that's very observant of you.

44:35.773 --> 44:40.039
You know, it's a good thing
they made us deputies, Clovis.

44:40.110 --> 44:43.443
They had an accident up at Hastings.
I decided I'd bring them with me.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.142
- Oh, dear! Well, come on in.
- I hope you don't mind.

44:46.216 --> 44:48.377
Not at all.
Come on in out of the cold.

44:48.452 --> 44:50.852
<i>- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Dick's here. He brought some guests.</i>

44:50.921 --> 44:52.912
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

44:52.990 --> 44:55.254
Think he'll remember us?

44:55.392 --> 44:59.852
- Can I take your bag?
- No! Hah!

44:59.963 --> 45:01.931
This is Mrs. Anderson.

45:02.032 --> 45:05.468
These guys had an accident up the road.
I decided to bring 'em over here.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.470
Oh.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.473
I remember you from
the bank this morning.

45:15.646 --> 45:19.514
- How do you mean?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

45:19.583 --> 45:22.177
I don't mean to come off
like I'm interrogating you...

45:22.252 --> 45:25.744
but the bank was robbed
this afternoon...

45:25.823 --> 45:29.816
- by three men.
- And on Christmas Eve?

45:29.893 --> 45:32.020
Well... what's this world
coming to?

45:32.096 --> 45:35.463
<i>Well, of course, I saw you talking
with Sarah Upstairs...</i>

45:35.566 --> 45:38.296
so I knew you
were all right.

45:39.803 --> 45:41.771
Upstairs?

45:41.872 --> 45:45.808
<i>Oh, we call her Sarah
Upstairs. She rents a room from us.</i>

45:45.876 --> 45:48.811
<i>She's been here
a couple of years now. Heh!</i>

45:48.879 --> 45:51.939
That is... terrific.

45:52.015 --> 45:55.075
These poor gentlemen.
First they get run off the road...

45:55.152 --> 45:58.588
and now we're practically
accusing them of being bank robbers.

45:58.655 --> 46:01.283
- Oh!
- I think they've had enough excitement for one day.

46:01.358 --> 46:03.883
- Don't you?
- You got that right, Mrs. A.

46:03.961 --> 46:07.226
Oh, Mrs.--
I like that.

46:07.331 --> 46:09.629
Oh, Aunt Hetty, um, I'm sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

46:09.733 --> 46:13.032
I told these gentlemen
I could get 'em a change of clothes.

46:19.643 --> 46:23.477
- No, no, no. - One
for you. - Thank you.

46:26.650 --> 46:29.744
Look, you can't do this.
These are from your wife, obviously.

46:29.820 --> 46:33.551
Yes, that's right. Now I'm giving them
to you. Merry Christmas, boys.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.889
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

46:36.960 --> 46:40.760
Oh, my goodness, son.
Your lip is bleeding.

46:40.864 --> 46:43.731
Oh, my God. I must need some
ointment or whatnot.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.429
<i>- He's all right. - Do you
got any-- What do you call it--</i>

46:46.537 --> 46:49.005
<i>- ointment or somethin'?
- He's all right.</i>

46:49.072 --> 46:51.905
<i>- Oh, no. We'll take care of him right away.
- He's all right.</i>

46:51.975 --> 46:55.138
- Don't be long.
- I need ointment!

46:55.212 --> 46:59.808
<i>- What's in it?
- Oh,you'll have to open it to find out.</i>

46:59.883 --> 47:04.149
Is it clothes?
I hope they fit.

47:04.221 --> 47:08.248
- Sarah Upstairs.
- Sarah Upstairs.

47:08.325 --> 47:11.920
<i>- I guess I should say Sarah Downstairs.
- 'Cause now I'm downstairs.</i>

47:11.995 --> 47:15.328
- When you're Upstairs, you're up.
- And--

47:15.432 --> 47:18.560
So what are you doing here?

47:18.669 --> 47:22.765
Uh, it's another long and miserable story
that I'd rather not get into right now.

47:22.840 --> 47:26.276
<i>- There's a three-legged dog over there
staring at me. - Oh, that's tripod.</i>

47:26.343 --> 47:29.972
We named him Tripod.

47:30.013 --> 47:34.006
He was a stray, he was hit by a truck,
and, you know, we took him in.

47:34.084 --> 47:36.917
<i>Poor doggie.</i>

47:36.987 --> 47:41.083
<i>- Oh, you know, you look damp.
You must be cold.</i>

47:41.158 --> 47:44.423
<i>- Why don't you change, or--
- Three on each side? Okay.</i>

47:44.494 --> 47:47.292
You know, wash up a little.
Get warm.

47:47.397 --> 47:51.333
With interstate 95
being the only major road still open.

47:51.435 --> 47:54.996
<i>The storm dumped 14 inches
in Chicago before moving east.</i>

47:55.105 --> 47:58.597
<i>There have been seven deaths
attributed to the weather so far.</i>

47:58.675 --> 48:00.609
What are you watchin',
Marla?

48:00.677 --> 48:03.646
- Oh,just a little TV.
- A daring prison break at Long Island State Prison in New York.

48:03.714 --> 48:08.947
<i>Two inmates took advantage of what is being
called the worst blizzard in 17 years...</i>

48:09.019 --> 48:12.352
overpowering three guards
and hijacking a laundry truck.

48:12.422 --> 48:15.858
An all-points bulletin has been issued--

48:21.098 --> 48:25.000
Oh ho! That's the spirit
we need in this house!

48:29.239 --> 48:32.538
- Whoa! Oh!

48:36.013 --> 48:38.243
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm just feelin' good.

48:38.315 --> 48:42.149
I'm feeling so good, I'm gonna call our
Ma. Mrs. Anderson, can we call our mother?

48:42.219 --> 48:45.382
Oh, oh, certainly, dear.
It's in the hall.

48:45.455 --> 48:49.152
Okay, okay. Bill, come on. Let's
call her. I'm dying to hear from her.

48:49.226 --> 48:52.252
What the hell's
the matter with you?

48:52.329 --> 48:55.526
Singing at the top of your lungs,
jumping around like Fred Astaire!

48:55.632 --> 48:58.100
I got carried away
by the Christmas spirit.

48:58.168 --> 49:01.365
I'm sorry I'm not
a deadbeat like you, Bill. Huh!

49:05.208 --> 49:07.768
You are really
getting paranoid.

49:10.113 --> 49:12.081
- Hello, Ma?
- Dave?

49:12.149 --> 49:14.242
<i>- Hey!
- Ooh!</i>

49:14.318 --> 49:18.015
If you don't give me that money, I'm
gonna throw your mother out the window!

49:18.088 --> 49:21.251
- I don't think she can fly, can she?
- Oh, no, no, no.

49:21.325 --> 49:23.691
Flying would be out of the question,
especially in this weather.

49:23.760 --> 49:26.285
- What's the problem?
- She wants to fly down here.

49:26.363 --> 49:30.823
- Did you rob that bank?
- Ah! What an imagination!

49:30.901 --> 49:34.268
- Let me talk to her.
- No. You know what she's like when she gets this way.

49:34.338 --> 49:36.431
- She's mad at you.
- She's mad at me?

49:36.506 --> 49:39.566
- Yeah. Let me take care of it.
- Where are you, goddamn it?

49:39.643 --> 49:44.012
Your mother said you went to Pennsylvania. You
got snowed in, didn't you, you dumb bastard?

49:44.081 --> 49:46.515
- Don't you call me-- Now,
you listen to me-- - All right.

49:46.583 --> 49:48.983
Wait a sec. Now, Ma, now,
you listen to me.

49:49.052 --> 49:51.111
Now, do us both a favor.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

49:51.188 --> 49:54.248
When the road clears,
we'll come down.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.157
We're not gonna hurt her,
as long as you do the right thing.

49:57.227 --> 49:59.661
All right, all right.
Love you too.

50:01.832 --> 50:05.324
- Oh! Oh, did you want to talk to her?
- Yes, I wanted to talk to her!

50:05.435 --> 50:09.201
<i>I'm takin'some cranberry sauce. It's
Christmas. What did that idiot say to ya?</i>

50:09.272 --> 50:11.638
He said he loved me.

50:11.708 --> 50:14.438
That is right. I thought so too.

50:14.511 --> 50:17.571
She is
a funny lady. How you guys doin'?

50:17.647 --> 50:20.480
You know what? They got some kinda
feast out there, I'm tellin' ya.

50:20.550 --> 50:23.246
- Wait till you see the giblet gravy.
- No, Alvin.

50:23.320 --> 50:26.721
We're going to be eating giblets in
Attica if we don't get out of here.

50:26.790 --> 50:30.055
Boys. Boys, the dinner
will be ready in 10 minutes.

50:30.127 --> 50:33.255
- You better go take your showers.
- You got it, Mrs. A.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.664
Mrs. A!

50:35.699 --> 50:39.260
<i>Oh, Mrs. A? Somethin' smells good.</i>

50:39.336 --> 50:44.467
- Nothin' better than that smell in the whole, wide world.
- It does smell good.

50:44.541 --> 50:48.500
- Yeah. It smells good.
- We got the beginnings of a real situation here.

50:48.578 --> 50:52.105
I just robbed these people.
I don't want to get to know them.

50:52.215 --> 50:54.183
Clove...

50:55.218 --> 50:57.448
I sense
a conspiracy here.

50:58.455 --> 51:01.822
- Let's radio the Feds.
- l--

51:01.892 --> 51:03.951
Clovis...

51:04.027 --> 51:06.996
you know what you are?

51:07.064 --> 51:09.032
What?

51:09.099 --> 51:11.124
- An alarmist.
- I am?

51:11.201 --> 51:14.534
Yes, you are. And that's not
a good thing to be.

51:14.604 --> 51:17.664
- It's not?
- No, it's not...

51:17.741 --> 51:20.175
especially when all
this money's at stake.

51:20.277 --> 51:26.147
Bill, would you, uh-- would you
please pass me the giblet gravy?

51:28.452 --> 51:33.355
Thank you. Oh.
There's some scallions in there.

51:33.423 --> 51:36.290
You know,
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson...

51:36.359 --> 51:39.658
I wanted to say my appreciation
for your hospitableness.

51:39.729 --> 51:42.357
Heh heh! 'Cause I love these giblets.
Look at that.

51:42.432 --> 51:44.866
<i>Scallions too. But anyway...</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:48.132
I just certainly hope we haven't
exposed ourselves upon you.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.469
No, no. Not at all.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.168
No. It's been a nice
diversion having you three with us.

51:53.243 --> 51:58.579
Mm. Otherwise, we'd just be sitting
around, talking about that terrible robbery.

51:58.648 --> 52:02.209
Mr. Anderson, if you don't mind
my asking,

52:02.319 --> 52:04.787
exactly how much
was taken?

52:04.855 --> 52:09.189
- No. They just said they don't
want to talk about it, Dave. - Ehh--

52:09.259 --> 52:14.526
Well, $275,000.

52:14.598 --> 52:17.897
See, I heard that banks
always claim...

52:17.968 --> 52:21.131
uh,
that more was stolen...

52:21.204 --> 52:25.197
than actually was
so they could claim double...

52:25.275 --> 52:28.767
<i>- on the insurance.
- Only a crook would do a thing like that.</i>

52:28.879 --> 52:32.315
That would make me no different
from the people who robbed me.

52:42.125 --> 52:44.650
Yeah, but what about puttin'
all the people to work?

52:44.728 --> 52:47.925
You know, 'cause you have to have all
that extra security and everything.

52:47.998 --> 52:52.059
In fact, I heard that bank robberies
actually stimulate the economy.

52:52.135 --> 52:54.626
You're enormously misinformed,
Mr. Firpo.

52:54.704 --> 52:59.539
The truth is that this robbery will probably
put this little bank out of business.

52:59.609 --> 53:01.600
<i>How's that?</i>

53:03.947 --> 53:07.747
Well, for years now, these big-city
banks have been threatening to come in...

53:07.817 --> 53:10.650
wanting to take us over.

53:10.720 --> 53:14.588
And now with this robbery,
the F.D.I.C. will come in...

53:14.658 --> 53:19.618
and investigate, and find that I make
loans to people just on a handshake.

53:19.696 --> 53:22.028
There's really
no collateral at all.

53:22.098 --> 53:24.589
And that, gentlemen,
will be the end of that.

53:24.668 --> 53:28.229
Well... excuse me,
Mr. Anderson, but...

53:28.305 --> 53:31.240
I can't pretend to know
too much about these matters.

53:31.308 --> 53:35.335
However, if what you say is
true-- which, I'm sure it is--

53:35.445 --> 53:38.642
um, then how could the bank
have so much cash on hand?

53:40.150 --> 53:43.051
Well, now,
that's the worst part of it.

53:43.119 --> 53:45.747
<i>That's a once-a-year deal.</i>

53:45.822 --> 53:51.317
Over the years, I've persuaded everybody in
town to open up a little Christmas club account.

53:51.394 --> 53:55.160
<i>You know, nothing much, but at the end
of year, everybody has a few extra dollars.</i>

53:55.232 --> 54:00.226
It adds up. It gives everybody
a little extra security and pride.

54:00.303 --> 54:03.101
It kept Main Street alive.

54:04.107 --> 54:06.098
Not this year.

54:06.176 --> 54:09.907
No, sir. Not this year.

54:16.119 --> 54:20.180
I just called the bus station. There's a road
to the south open that's going to Philly.

54:20.257 --> 54:24.660
- Oh, that's excellent.
- Philadelphia? That's a little out of our way, don't you think?

54:24.728 --> 54:29.062
Alvin, there's a train from Philly
to New York. It takes a couple hours.

54:29.132 --> 54:32.499
<i>- Might get there by midnight.
- If you'd like to catch it, we should probably go now.</i>

54:32.569 --> 54:35.663
- I think so.
- Oh. Well, I'll make you some sandwiches.

54:35.739 --> 54:38.731
No, no. We're fine.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

54:38.808 --> 54:41.299
Do you need any money?

54:41.378 --> 54:43.608
- No, we couldn't. - No,
we couldn't. - No, no.

54:43.713 --> 54:47.547
- No. We've taken more than our share already.
- No, no. Here. You take this.

54:47.617 --> 54:50.518
- You take this and have a nice, happy, safe,
- Mrs. A, please.

54:50.587 --> 54:52.646
eh--

54:54.424 --> 54:57.757
- Don't forget those coats. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

54:57.827 --> 55:00.489
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

55:00.563 --> 55:02.861
- Come again any time.
- Thanks for the suit.

55:02.932 --> 55:29.492
Thank you. Thank you
for my festive sweater.

55:29.527 --> 55:32.825
Looks like they're
going somewhere.

55:34.030 --> 55:36.999
Figured that out,
did you?

55:37.100 --> 55:39.796
Did you see the way he was
holding that duffle bag?

55:39.869 --> 55:42.064
How?

55:42.138 --> 55:45.335
The same way I would:
close to my heart.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.944
<i>We're going for the money.
We're not waiting for nobody.</i>

55:49.012 --> 55:50.946
<i>- Right.
- What are you saying?</i>

55:50.980 --> 55:53.813
That my boys wouldn't
come back and save me?

55:53.883 --> 55:58.217
That they'd rather have a couple of
hundred-thousand bucks over a mother's love?

55:58.288 --> 56:01.655
I wouldn't pay three bucks for you.

56:01.758 --> 56:03.692
Can I ask you
a personal question?

56:03.760 --> 56:07.719
What were you doing
five years for? Stupidity?

56:07.831 --> 56:10.197
Hey, Edna, how'd you like to ride
in the trunk of the car?

56:10.266 --> 56:13.895
''Edna''? ''Edna''?
Are we sleeping together? I think not.

56:13.970 --> 56:16.438
You call me Mrs. Firpo,
goddamn it.

56:16.506 --> 56:20.135
- Don't aggravate the old witch.
- I wish I was a witch.

56:20.210 --> 56:22.508
I'd shove my broomstick
right up your ass.

56:22.579 --> 56:26.106
I'll say whatever I want.
Do you like music?

56:26.182 --> 56:29.515
- Oh,Jesus.

56:45.568 --> 56:47.559
Thanks a lot.

56:53.042 --> 56:55.510
I don't see snow chains.

56:55.578 --> 56:59.173
This was very nice of you.
Please tell the Andersons--

57:01.050 --> 57:03.644
- What was that about?
- I have no idea.

57:03.720 --> 57:07.281
All right. I'll get the tickets.
You two separate.

57:07.357 --> 57:11.316
- ''Separate''?
- Just pretend like you don't know each other.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.363
- Do I know you?
- No.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.626
- You look familiar.
- Well, I'm not.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.667
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you nut.

57:24.674 --> 57:27.404
Can't let 'em
get on that bus.

57:27.477 --> 57:29.411
We're gonna take
that money.

57:29.479 --> 57:32.141
You sure this is
the right thing to do, Ed?

57:35.185 --> 57:37.176
Say, ''Spill
on aisle three.''

57:39.923 --> 57:41.948
Spill on aisle three.

57:42.058 --> 57:44.288
- You wanna be saying that the rest of your life?
- No, I don't.

57:44.394 --> 57:47.090
- Then help me get that money.
- Okay.

57:51.835 --> 57:56.204
You're not gonna believe this,
but I don't-- I don't have enough money.

57:57.774 --> 58:00.242
Wait a minute.

58:22.131 --> 58:24.827
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

58:28.104 --> 58:30.664
- Any luck?
- No.

58:30.740 --> 58:34.801
What am l--

58:34.878 --> 58:37.506
What am I gonna... do?

58:38.915 --> 58:42.146
Huh?
That's my bus.

58:42.218 --> 58:46.382
- Going home to your fammily?
- No,just my mother actually.

58:59.903 --> 59:03.100
<i>Please-- Please, I can't--</i>

59:03.172 --> 59:07.165
I mean, I want it.
I can't accept it.

59:07.243 --> 59:09.803
I do--
No, I can't.

59:09.879 --> 59:13.576
You're lucky you're in Paradise.
Merry Christmas, sir.

59:22.191 --> 59:25.388
<i>- Why don't you wait inside?
- Excuse me.</i>

59:25.495 --> 59:28.362
He's got our money,
Clovis.

59:29.699 --> 59:32.532
- Can I check your bags?
- Let's see what's in the bag.

59:32.602 --> 59:34.934
- What?
- F.B.I. The bag.

59:35.004 --> 59:38.633
- ''The bag''?
- The bag, sir.

59:38.708 --> 59:41.939
- Hey!
- Get him! Take him down!

59:42.011 --> 59:44.445
<i>Freeze! Freeze!</i>

59:44.514 --> 59:47.779
- Don't move.
- Oh, shit!

59:53.122 --> 59:55.056
Oh, my God, a gun!

59:55.158 --> 59:59.094
- Oh, God, he's got a gun!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:59.195 --> 01:00:02.289
<i>You got the wrong guy!
It's the guy with the floppy ears!</i>

01:00:02.398 --> 01:00:04.559
Let's go.

01:00:04.634 --> 01:00:07.034
<i>What happened?</i>

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:10.470
No! No! No!

01:00:16.546 --> 01:00:19.310
- What's going on here?
- We may have found two of our suspects.

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:21.350
All right, all right,
all right.

01:00:22.919 --> 01:00:25.547
- Oh, shit.
- What? You know him?

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:29.388
Yeah, unfortunately.
That's Ed Dawson and Clovis Minor.

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:32.859
- They're both my deputies.
- Hey, how you doin', fellas?

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:49.404
That, by God, was close.
That was close.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.777
Now our ride's gone.
Shit!

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:54.612
- What the hell happened back there?
- I have no idea!

01:00:54.684 --> 01:00:58.142
I don't like this.

01:00:58.221 --> 01:01:00.314
We're screwed.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.688
Come on. Y-Y-You gotta think
of a way to get us out of here.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:07.525
All right!
Quit pressuring me, please!

01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:12.660
Look, there's only one way I can think
of that's gonna get us out of here...

01:01:12.735 --> 01:01:14.669
and it's a longshot.

01:01:14.737 --> 01:01:16.932
Let me get this straight.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:20.772
- You had no idea what was going on in that bus station.
- No, sir.

01:01:20.843 --> 01:01:23.676
Your gun just happened to go off
three times in a row by itself.

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:28.843
No. I thought what I saw
might be a suspect.

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:33.719
So, maybe my partner Clovis
and I got a little...

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.987
over-anticapatory.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:41.655
<i>Agent Peyser-- Excuse me.
Will you guys knock it off,please?</i>

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:45.700
<i>Just put the ball away for now.
Thank you.</i>

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:50.603
These kids tell me they saw three guys
push a car into the river this afternoon.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:55.542
- They tell me they can show us the exact spot.
- Hallelujah. Huh?

01:01:58.414 --> 01:02:01.178
- Are you coming along with us?
- No, no, no. Not you two.

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:03.878
Just stay out
of my sight.

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.444
Will you just cool it?

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:34.249
<i>You know, I just hate to ruin
this Hallmark moment.</i>

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:38.378
Would you get over here and help me
lug this boat to the river!

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.983
That's it.
We're done being nice to you.

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.952
<i>Get out,you pain in the ass.
I've had it with you.</i>

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:14.512
Enough is enough.
Come on. Get out.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:17.320
- You call this being nice?
- This is as nice as we're gonna get.

01:03:17.426 --> 01:03:21.522
Putting a gun to my head and dragging me across
three states on the night Christ was born.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:25.931
- Gag her.
- You're doing me a goddamn favor!

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:27.799
You think this is torture?

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:31.567
Anything's better than looking at you two
gorillas and listening to your horse shit.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:35.077
- Just get in the trunk.
- You guys are dumber than a box of hair.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:38.602
<i>- Gag her!
- Oh, cut it out. You can't--</i>

01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:41.206
<i>Good night, Edna.</i>

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:45.878
Hey, we made it!

01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:50.085
Come on. The harder we row,
the faster we go. Come on!

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.928
Wha-- Wait a minute.
What?

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:57.432
- Bill, you're a genius.
- Yeah, but in the Firpo family...

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:59.467
the man with
half a brain is king.

01:03:59.535 --> 01:04:01.867
Come on. Row, row!
Like a Viking, Alvin!

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:04.099
- Row! Row!
- Like a Viking!

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.905
Alvin!

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:11.504
<i>- Alvin!
- Alvin, come back!</i>

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:17.381
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:25.319
Help! Help! Help!

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:32.463
Help!

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:36.035
Down this side.
This side.

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:41.099
<i>Help! Help!</i>

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:44.678
- Look.
- Over here.

01:04:44.747 --> 01:04:47.215
Over by the rock.

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:49.649
There's a man in the water.

01:04:49.719 --> 01:04:52.779
- Here.
- Hang on. We're gonna get you out of there.

01:04:52.855 --> 01:04:56.052
Hold on, Alvin!

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:58.626
- Oh!
- I got ya.

01:05:00.162 --> 01:05:02.096
- Hang on, son.
- Give me a hand.

01:05:02.164 --> 01:05:05.258
Hang on!
Grab my hand!

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:08.098
<i>Alvin, grab his hand!</i>

01:05:09.338 --> 01:05:12.171
<i>Come on.
Just grab it.</i>

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:16.041
<i>- Give him your hand.
- I got him!</i>

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.580
<i>Right in this room.</i>

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:20.912
<i>Lay him down by the fire.</i>

01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:29.317
Oh, Christ.
He looks like he's turning blue.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:32.019
- What's that mean?
- He's got water in his lungs.

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.995
Just stay back there.
Give me some room here.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:39.160
<i>Come on, son. Spit some of
that stuff out of there. Come on.</i>

01:05:39.235 --> 01:05:41.100
Come on. There.

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:01.316
<i>That means he's
going to be all right.</i>

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:04.359
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred.

01:06:04.427 --> 01:06:06.395
- Flinstone?
- Yes.

01:06:08.164 --> 01:06:10.428
There.
He'll be all right now.

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:12.831
How about a little soup
and brandy?

01:06:12.902 --> 01:06:16.668
- Mix the two together?
- No, the brandy's for me.

01:06:16.739 --> 01:06:18.673
Oh.

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:21.869
I think we lucked out
with those kids.

01:06:21.944 --> 01:06:24.003
- Boy, the car's soaked good.
- Yeah.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:26.014
<i>Let's roll it over.
We gotta get it in the truck.</i>

01:06:26.082 --> 01:06:27.515
<i>- Anybody got a crowbar?
- Yeah.</i>

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:29.813
<i>- Get it.
- We gotta get a crowbar here, okay?</i>

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.281
Give me some light.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.983
Might find a walleye in there.
See anything?

01:06:39.095 --> 01:06:42.758
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:06:43.966 --> 01:06:47.663
- What the hell are those things?
- Ski masks.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.535
Merry Christmas!

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:53.666
- Thank you. That's sweet of you.
- Thank you very much.

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.576
That's my sister.
You know.

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.909
I don't think you'll be able
to smoke when we go into church.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.846
I wanna thank you
for saving my life.

01:07:00.916 --> 01:07:02.850
You know, almost drowning
and everything.

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.852
Oh, you don't have to
put it out now.

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.286
You could have puffed
a little longer.

01:07:07.356 --> 01:07:09.290
Oh, this is nice.

01:07:14.663 --> 01:07:18.463
- Look, there's Timmy.
- Merry Christmas, Timmy.

01:07:18.498 --> 01:07:22.263
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

01:07:22.338 --> 01:07:25.171
I thought you boys were on your way
to Philadelphia.

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:28.176
Well, the bus
left without us.

01:07:28.244 --> 01:07:31.179
- Oh, well. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:33.977
<i>- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Merry Christmas, Father.</i>

01:07:36.452 --> 01:07:39.046
I'm going to confession.

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:42.386
They don't have confession.
They're Protestants.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:45.791
- Are you shitting me?
- No.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:49.456
I don't care. I'm going in anyway.

01:07:49.532 --> 01:07:54.799
All right. I'll be out here
with the... do-re-me.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:58.139
Why are you
still here?

01:07:58.207 --> 01:08:00.072
Why am I still here?
What?

01:08:00.142 --> 01:08:02.576
You sound like you're anxious
to get rid of us. What's the matter?

01:08:02.645 --> 01:08:06.137
- I just wish you'd go.
- Why is that?

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:10.878
You know, I think you did
something stupid today.

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:13.318
Something you
may regret.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:15.755
Your last name
isn't Collins, is it?

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.817
No. No,
it's not.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:23.058
I've lied to a lot of people I care about,
so please,just go while you can.

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.006
Sarah.

01:08:34.376 --> 01:08:37.640
I can't.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:39.772
You can't what?

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:43.783
- I can't leave knowing what I know.
- What are you saying?

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:48.346
I'm saying-- I'm saying
I like these people too.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:52.325
I like them too. And I wish that I could think
of something to make this all better.

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:56.529
Maybe you're not
thinking hard enough.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:01.269
Look, can I ask you
a question?

01:09:02.337 --> 01:09:04.465
Do you think people change?

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.031
Do you believe a person can be
on one road their whole life...

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.703
and then just back up
and take another?

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:14.738
- I think that all depends.
- Depends... on the road.

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.818
It depends on the person.

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.654
Depends on the person.

01:09:22.224 --> 01:09:24.158
Depends on the person.

01:09:30.698 --> 01:09:32.633
This headstone says Anderson.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.370
Is that any relation?

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:41.036
It's Clifford's
great-grandfather.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.703
<i>''1835-1892. ''</i>

01:09:47.149 --> 01:09:50.676
God. Your whole life's
in that dash, isn't it?

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:52.845
Yeah.

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.526
What are you doing?

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:02.257
I don't know.

01:10:02.331 --> 01:10:04.765
You don't know me.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:07.666
Sorry.

01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:37.365
- Easy, now. Easy, now, Merlin.
- Bill, get in. Whoa!

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.925
Bill, 20 years minimum.
Get in.

01:10:41.003 --> 01:10:43.130
- Tell him to get in.
- I don't know about taking the kid's sleigh.

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:46.697
- There's something ain't right about that.
- I'll get in.

01:10:46.775 --> 01:10:49.642
<i>After all these presents
and stuff.</i>

01:10:49.712 --> 01:10:51.577
<i>- Oh, no, cops!
- Hey!</i>

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:54.741
<i>- Come on, Bill. Get in.
- Hey, that's Timmy's sleigh!</i>

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:58.047
What'd he call it?
Yahoo! Whoo!

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.112
Come on, Merlin!
Come on! Come on!

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:04.556
What do you call it? Gallop!
That's it! That's it! Come on! Come on!

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.629
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.598
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.780
Yahoo! Yahoo!

01:11:26.915 --> 01:11:29.850
Come on, Clovis.
I know a shortcut.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.546
What's going on here?

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:36.591
I don't know, but those three guys
stole my kid's horse and sleigh.

01:11:36.692 --> 01:11:41.493
<i>Merlin! Dad! Dad! Dad!</i>

01:11:41.563 --> 01:11:44.623
- Merlin! Dad! They took Merl--
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.192
<i>- Stay here! I know that!
- But, Dad, they took Merlin!</i>

01:12:02.251 --> 01:12:05.687
<i>- Good shot.
- Hey, see you guys.</i>

01:12:05.754 --> 01:12:09.781
That wasn't fair! Hey!

01:12:09.858 --> 01:12:12.053
I hate this town.
I hate it.

01:12:12.127 --> 01:12:15.961
I hate it. Christmas Eve,
and my wife had the--

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:20.127
I didn't get to see that thing pop up
on the turkey. I was-- I hate it.

01:12:22.971 --> 01:12:24.905
<i>A sleigh?
Catch the sleigh!</i>

01:12:24.973 --> 01:12:26.964
Faster! Faster!

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.909
<i>Come on! Come on! Go!</i>

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:32.105
Run! Run, Merlin! Run!

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:36.207
- Whoo!
- Turn! Turn! To the right! Okay!

01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:43.324
Whoa!

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:46.520
Look out. Look out.
Jesus.

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.563
Back up.
We're gonna lose them.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:56.671
<i>- Oh, God!
- Go, Alvin, go!</i>

01:12:58.741 --> 01:13:01.073
<i>- Go!
- Alvin, do you know what you're doing?</i>

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.806
You do what you do, I do what I do!

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.871
Then hurry up!

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:12.144
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:13:22.931 --> 01:13:26.264
- Hi, Officer! Bye, Officer!
- Go! Yeah!

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:28.235
Yes! Yes!

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:35.100
Oh, my God!

01:13:35.177 --> 01:13:37.668
Whoo!

01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:40.078
Unbelievable. Ow!
Unbelievable.

01:13:40.182 --> 01:13:44.118
<i>Come on. Keep going. Go.</i>

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.155
- On 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em!
- Go! Go!

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:49.156
<i>We got 'em. Come on!</i>

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:52.159
<i>Run right up into them.</i>

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:54.161
Right up into them.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:20.622
Whoa. Whoa.

01:14:30.499 --> 01:14:32.660
Hey, Merlin.

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.668
Hey, thanks a lot, okay?

01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:36.670
We really appreciated it.

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:39.673
I'm never gonna forget you.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:42.141
All right. You're a good horse.
Stay strong.

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:51.252
<i>Bill. Hey, Bill,
wait a minute.</i>

01:14:52.454 --> 01:14:55.150
We can't leave him here.

01:14:55.224 --> 01:15:00.059
<i>I mean, I couldn't live with myself
if I froze a horse, especially him.</i>

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.790
You're cracking up.
Both of you.

01:15:02.865 --> 01:15:04.856
Come on.

01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:16.968
<i>You stay there, Merlin. Stay there.</i>

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:22.610
Bill, we made it.
Alvin, we made it.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:26.415
All right. Let's all stick our thumbs out
and look pitiful.

01:15:26.488 --> 01:15:30.083
- That should be easy.
- Easy. Pitiful. Thumbs.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:37.555
- Hey, stop.
- Here we go. We're here.

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:40.261
- I can't tell you how happy I am.
- Hi. How are you?

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:42.530
<i>My name is Dave.</i>

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:46.267
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:15:46.341 --> 01:15:49.276
- We were out here skiing, and the back of it--
- Oh, man!

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:51.812
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.548
All right. All right!

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:02.419
Oh, no!

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:05.358
<i>- Who needs you? Forget it.
- Hold on, Merlin!</i>

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:07.361
We're coming, Merlin!

01:16:07.429 --> 01:16:10.421
<i>- We gotta get him out.
- You're not gonna die.</i>

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.592
<i>You're not gonna die!</i>

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:16.627
- Cut it out! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on!

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:20.141
Hold him! He's coming! Get around his back!
Push him! Push him!

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:23.405
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Get him out of the water!

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.378
<i>- Push!
- Go! Go!</i>

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:29.406
<i>- Go!
- He's coming out!</i>

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:42.897
- Coffee?
- You bet.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:46.128
<i>- Can I take your order now?
- I'm not quite sure.</i>

01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:01.415
Guys...

01:17:01.483 --> 01:17:05.715
I still got the keys
to the vault on me.

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:11.453
I'm gonna go back to town,
and I'm gonna put the money back.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:21.098
I know I didn't
hear you right.

01:17:21.169 --> 01:17:25.765
You can either come with me or not,
but that's what I'm doing.

01:17:25.841 --> 01:17:30.403
Bill, I think that dunk
in the lake got to your brain.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:35.974
- You are not thinking clearly.
- No, I'm thinking very clearly.

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.518
You hear that?
Silent night, holy night.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:40.851
''Adeste Fideles.''
''God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.''

01:17:40.922 --> 01:17:43.789
This is the best Christmas present
I could ever give to you.

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:47.727
I appreciate the sentiment.
You let me decide what I get for Christmas.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:50.890
This money belongs
to me and Alvin too, you know.

01:17:50.966 --> 01:17:54.367
It never belonged to us.
It belonged to the town.

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:56.597
What are you telling me?

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.436
That you are going to be
the first guy in history to get pinched...

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.976
<i>for putting money
back into a vault?</i>

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:05.411
If I get pinched, I get pinched.
That's the way that one went.

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.472
I'm not gonna sit here
and argue with you about it.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:13.044
- He's telling us what to do with our share of the money.
- Put my share back.

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.693
What is wrong with you guys?

01:18:19.761 --> 01:18:22.525
You have a couple of eggnogs
with some farmers...

01:18:22.597 --> 01:18:24.895
and now you wanna go back
and work for minumum wage?

01:18:27.102 --> 01:18:29.093
- Make up your mind, 'cause I'm going.
- No, you're not.

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:31.332
You're not going!
You are still a wanted man in New York!

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:33.499
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:38.740
No, he's not. All right?
It's over.

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:43.109
The whole thing...

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.846
was a... setup...

01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:48.923
just to get you
down here.

01:18:50.425 --> 01:18:52.518
Now, one other thing.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:57.160
Does that look familiar?

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.393
It's a little wet...

01:18:59.468 --> 01:19:02.198
but it's--

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:04.261
it's yours.

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:10.409
You never-- You never
did drop it.

01:19:12.547 --> 01:19:14.845
What are you looking at?
What?

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:20.217
But there were ten million cops
at the restaurant.

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.218
I did it.

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:28.489
I called them.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.591
I told them.

01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:37.566
I told them there was
a sniper on the roof.

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:50.541
You all right?

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:54.454
Yeah, I'm all right.
Except--

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.058
Oh!

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.390
Sorry. Put the table
on their tab.

01:20:00.495 --> 01:20:03.487
He's got the spirit,
don't he?

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:06.965
He handled that
pretty well.

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:09.299
Did you see
my Pez dispenser anywhere?

01:20:09.371 --> 01:20:11.737
No. Shut up.
Check!

01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:14.935
<i>- Hey, hey! Excuse me, sir.
I've got an emergency.</i>

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:17.478
- Are you headed towards Paradise?
- No, I'm going to New York.

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:21.545
Where were you
five hours ago?

01:20:21.616 --> 01:20:24.813
- You going south?
- Nope.

01:20:24.886 --> 01:20:28.117
<i>Hey, Edna,
can I get you anything?</i>

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:30.249
Come on. Don't take all night
putting this gas in.

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:33.055
Excuse me. Would you mind telling me
which way you're headed?

01:20:33.161 --> 01:20:36.062
- Get outta here.
- It's an emergency. I've gotta get to Paradise.

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:39.133
We don't like
to ride with strangers.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:41.965
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.
- What the hell.

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:44.870
A little company might be good.
Come on.Jump in.

01:20:44.940 --> 01:20:47.306
- I told you not to say anything.
- I can keep a secret.

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.673
I told you to shut up, and you--
You're supposed to be on my side.

01:20:49.744 --> 01:20:51.735
- Shit.
- What?

01:20:51.813 --> 01:20:55.249
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.609
Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

01:21:12.901 --> 01:21:16.393
- No, goddamn it! Sons of bitches!
- It's all right.

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:24.375
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, guys.

01:21:24.446 --> 01:21:27.313
Rough night?

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:30.545
You have no idea
what kind of night I've had.

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:34.350
I'm just real lucky you're
going the same way as me.

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:44.125
- What's that banging noise?
- I don't hear nothing.

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:48.669
<i>Me either.</i>

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.001
Wait a minute. No, no, wait.
There it goes again.

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.905
It's a very distinct
thumping sound.

01:21:53.975 --> 01:21:56.375
Kind of like a boom, boom, boom.
Don't you hear it?

01:21:56.444 --> 01:21:59.140
Oh, yeah. We've been
hearing that all night.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.517
Hey, can I share
something with you?

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.576
Yeah.

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.713
I know I just met you guys,
and it's kind of corny...

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.780
but tonight's been
a real eye-opener for me.

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.588
- How's that?
- I just--

01:22:12.694 --> 01:22:15.185
I realized tonight that I love people,
you know?

01:22:15.297 --> 01:22:19.233
I mean, life is great. Yeah? Huh?
Isn't life great?

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:23.168
- You sound like you're in love.
- Well, as a matter of fact...

01:22:24.873 --> 01:22:27.467
I just met this
really terrific woman.

01:22:27.542 --> 01:22:29.476
What's her name?

01:22:29.544 --> 01:22:32.035
- I can really use something like that in my life.
- What's her name?

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:33.671
- Her name's Sarah. Yeah.
- Sarah?

01:22:33.748 --> 01:22:37.582
<i>- You got a picture?
- Do you have any idea how long it's been...</i>

01:22:37.652 --> 01:22:39.950
since I've had a picture
of a woman in my wallet?

01:22:40.021 --> 01:22:43.218
- Except my mother, of course.
- You got a picture of your mother in your wallet?

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.225
- Yeah.
- I have the same thing in my wallet.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:47.955
Well, then let's compare.

01:22:48.063 --> 01:22:51.590
It's a beautiful thing.

01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:53.827
I really hope we can all
get to be friends.

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:55.870
There she is.

01:23:08.116 --> 01:23:10.414
What are you doing?

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:13.249
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!
- What are you doing?

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:16.620
<i>Stop it! Are you crazy?
Stop it!</i>

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:18.716
- Put the gun down!
- Get off of me!

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.886
- The cops are down the street.
- He's got our money!

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:23.965
<i>- Just get in the car.
- I'll kill him.</i>

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:50.353
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Merlin!

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.359
Hold on! Hold on!
Whoa!

01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:56.157
What do you call it?
Whoa, Merlin! That-a-boy. Okay.

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:59.665
<i>- Hey, look who it is!
- Get in, Bill.</i>

01:23:59.734 --> 01:24:02.703
- We gotta have a serious talk! Now
get me the hell outta here! - Uh-oh.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:07.037
<i>Serious talk.
Come on. Come on, Merlin.</i>

01:24:12.547 --> 01:24:15.107
<i>What do you call it? Whoa.</i>

01:24:15.183 --> 01:24:19.677
So, I guess we have
a clean slate now. Huh?

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:22.052
Good boy, Merlin.

01:24:22.123 --> 01:24:25.718
Go home now. Stay off the interstate.

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:28.523
There you go.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:31.121
Not quite.

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.111
Shh!

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.705
Quiet, okay?

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:52.082
So I get into the car
with these two strangers, and--

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:56.283
this is very funny--

01:24:56.357 --> 01:25:01.488
I show them a picture of Ma,
and they start shooting at me.

01:25:01.596 --> 01:25:04.064
That's weird.

01:25:04.132 --> 01:25:07.659
- That's weird.
- Do you have any idea why?

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:12.035
Maybe it was a bad picture.

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:16.237
Hey! Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:25:16.311 --> 01:25:19.371
Who are they?

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.813
<i>Hey, Bill, I mean,
were they alone?</i>

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:23.817
I said there
were two of them.

01:25:23.885 --> 01:25:26.479
- There was nobody else with them?
- I just said there were two of them.

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.488
They were alone.

01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:30.990
I just said
there were two of them!

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.050
- Oh, good.
- What do you mean, ''Oh, good''?

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:37.030
I mean--
What do I mean, Dave?

01:25:37.098 --> 01:25:39.089
He-- He--

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.430
He means that...

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:45.200
if there were more than two,
you could have been hurt.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:47.207
Three's bad.
That's right.

01:25:47.275 --> 01:25:49.266
I'm getting this feeling...

01:25:49.344 --> 01:25:51.539
that you're not
telling me something!

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:54.309
Yeah, well, this feeling
you're getting is paranoia!

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:57.010
- I don't think so!
- Well, think again!

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:59.110
Come on.
Let's just go.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:05.182
I'm almost certain
this one's it.

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:09.720
Hey, Bill, a guy in prison told
me if you use the wrong key...

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:12.823
you could set off
the alarm.

01:26:12.934 --> 01:26:15.630
Why don't you let me
do the crackin'...

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:17.637
and you do the jackin'?

01:26:17.705 --> 01:26:19.969
Hey, leave him alone, Bill.
Prison's a lonely place.

01:26:20.041 --> 01:26:21.975
- You told.
- Sure, I heard things in the night.

01:26:22.043 --> 01:26:24.568
Shut up!

01:26:24.646 --> 01:26:27.046
<i>Shit! I told ya!</i>

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.549
- Stop the madness!
- All right, all right, all right.

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.778
It said ''Nissan.''
Nissan.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:34.413
- Nissan's for a car.
- But it was round...

01:26:34.489 --> 01:26:36.480
- Okay! All right!
- with a curve that goes like an ''S.''

01:26:36.558 --> 01:26:38.549
- Hurry up, Bill!
- Okay! Okay!

01:26:38.626 --> 01:26:40.594
You're kidding me.

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:45.799
- Agent Peyser?
- What?

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:48.028
- Agent Peyser?
- What?

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:51.196
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, come on. Try me.

01:26:51.272 --> 01:26:53.638
We got another alarm
at the bank.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:58.805
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.111
No! Shit!

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.860
I know what to do.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:28.340
That's the most money
I ever held at once.

01:27:29.344 --> 01:27:32.142
You're right, Bill.

01:27:32.213 --> 01:27:34.272
Never was ours.

01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:39.917
I tell you,
I never felt better in my life.

01:28:05.246 --> 01:28:08.079
Where'd you go for that tire?
Palm Beach?

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:10.140
Sorry, Ed.

01:28:14.822 --> 01:28:17.950
Holy shit. Get down, Clovis.
Get down.

01:28:18.059 --> 01:28:20.118
Boy, am I good.

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:25.329
Get inside of theJeep,
or I'll blow your heads off.

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:42.715
You know, every time there's a problem,
those two idiots show up.

01:28:42.784 --> 01:28:44.718
I'm telling you,
they know something.

01:28:44.786 --> 01:28:47.687
Listen, guys. Where are you taking us?
What is this?

01:28:47.755 --> 01:28:49.780
Up to that
bank president's house.

01:28:49.857 --> 01:28:52.223
''Bank-- '' ''Bank president''?
What are you talking about?

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:54.261
What do you think,
we're stupid?

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.890
<i>No, I don't think you're stupid, but I know
how to keep you in suspense.</i>

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:01.491
<i>- How?
- I bet I know how to keep you in suspense.</i>

01:29:01.602 --> 01:29:05.197
- How?
- For Christ's sake, Clovis! They're bullshitting you!

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:09.573
- We know that's where the money is.
- Money? What money?

01:29:09.644 --> 01:29:13.774
- Yeah, we-- we don't have any money.
- Oh, shut up, will you?

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.782
You don't think we know
what you're doing?

01:29:15.850 --> 01:29:18.444
You and the Andersons probably
cooked this whole thing up together.

01:29:20.655 --> 01:29:23.522
<i>Looks like they got company
with them in thatJeep.</i>

01:29:23.591 --> 01:29:25.525
All units,
this is Agent Peyser.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:28.561
We are in pursuit
of a 1994 black Pathfinder.

01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:32.360
<i>- License plateD-U-H--
- That's appropriate.</i>

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:34.367
Vanity plates.

01:29:34.435 --> 01:29:37.029
D- U-H-1-7-1.

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:41.633
Location: east on Main Street,
heading toward River Road.

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:46.807
''So, uh, what kind
of license plate do you have?''

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.872
''Duh.''

01:29:58.659 --> 01:30:00.650
Come on! Move it!

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.064
Come on!

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:08.329
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!</i>

01:30:12.273 --> 01:30:14.833
<i>Look at those clowns.</i>

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.843
<i>Why don't wejust take 'em?</i>

01:30:16.911 --> 01:30:19.971
No. Let's wait and see
what they're up to.

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:25.279
Hit the wipers.

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.422
<i>Am I nuts?
I know those plates.</i>

01:30:29.490 --> 01:30:31.981
Where do I know
those plates from?

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:36.987
Something came over the wire tonight
about two escaped convicts...

01:30:37.098 --> 01:30:39.032
<i>in a Caddy
with New York plates.</i>

01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:41.933
That's right. Get on the horn.
Get everybody down here.

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:47.373
You're gonna have to kill me, because I'm not
dragging those people in that house into this.

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.535
So why don't you
just pull your trigger?

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:53.273
There's no money, all right?
So just get it out of your head.

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:58.952
They're here.

01:30:59.020 --> 01:31:00.885
Yep. They're here.

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:03.355
Let's take them down.

01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:07.756
Come on, pecker head!
Move!

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:10.296
<i>Clovis, watch these three clowns
while I check out the house.</i>

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:13.026
Okay, Ed.

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:21.064
Season's greetings.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.643
Shut up and get inside.

01:31:24.712 --> 01:31:27.909
<i>Well, well, well. Doesn't that figure?
Get out of my face.</i>

01:31:27.982 --> 01:31:30.314
- Shut up and get in.
- Ma! What--

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:33.148
What-- What are you
doing here?

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:37.658
I'm being held hostage on the night babyJesus
was born. What the hell does it look like?

01:31:37.725 --> 01:31:40.558
Get over there.

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.596
- Please don't tell me you knew about this.
- Uh, no. No, l--

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.934
I'm sorry.
I know it's bad.

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:51.369
- Whoa.

01:31:51.439 --> 01:31:55.500
- I'm sorry, Ma.

01:31:55.576 --> 01:31:58.101
I'm sorry, everybody.

01:31:58.179 --> 01:32:01.012
<i>- I swear I'm gonna get us all out of this.
- Oh, no. Come on.</i>

01:32:01.082 --> 01:32:04.415
It wasn't your fault. It was my fault,
Ma. l-- I convinced Bill...

01:32:04.485 --> 01:32:07.682
that he was a wanted man in New York
and he had to come down here.

01:32:07.755 --> 01:32:10.656
No choice. But he resisted,
every step of the way.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:13.659
- Sarah, he didn't know about your father.
- Yeah, sure.

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:16.595
No. He really thought he was dying,
and he came down here to help you.

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:20.998
- What are you talking about?
- Just give us the money, and we're out of here.

01:32:21.068 --> 01:32:24.469
You're in for a rude awakening,
because there's no money! Okay?

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:27.997
- No! No!
- V-V-Vic, listen to me.

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:31.602
There's no money. He's not lying.
I swear on my mother's grave.

01:32:31.679 --> 01:32:35.445
Don't say that with this lunatic
pointing a gun at my head.

01:32:35.516 --> 01:32:37.484
Are you telling me
you didn't rob the bank?

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:41.978
Is it true?

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:48.395
Yeah. We did it, Mr. Anderson,
and we're sorry.

01:32:48.496 --> 01:32:51.761
But I swear we're not the same people
we were this morning. I swear it.

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:56.428
- Oh, where's my violin?
- Vic, you gotta believe us.

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.472
<i>These people,
they're good people.</i>

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:02.771
<i>They took us in, and they treated us
like we was one of their own.</i>

01:33:02.843 --> 01:33:06.779
- And all we could do in return
was steal from them.

01:33:10.217 --> 01:33:13.778
Vic, these people had nothing to do
with this. You gotta let 'em go!

01:33:13.888 --> 01:33:15.856
<i>We can solve this
between us.</i>

01:33:15.923 --> 01:33:18.414
I'll let 'em go
as soon as I get my money.

01:33:18.526 --> 01:33:20.585
Vic, we put
the money back.

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:23.289
<i>Put it back? Back in the bank?</i>

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.854
No.

01:33:26.934 --> 01:33:28.868
We gave the money
to the church.

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:32.337
<i>You expect me to believe that
horse shit? Who wants to die first?</i>

01:33:32.406 --> 01:33:35.102
Pop, will you knock it off?

01:33:44.118 --> 01:33:48.111
<i>Who gets shot first?
Suspenders.</i>

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:50.190
<i>Then maybe you.</i>

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:57.023
Get down. Get down.
Way down, boys. Get down.

01:33:58.399 --> 01:34:00.390
<i>- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?</i>

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.528
I've got bad news.
We got a hostage situation.

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:06.095
And your son's inside.

01:34:06.173 --> 01:34:08.733
Move! Move up!

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:14.511
This is the F.B.I.
You're completely surrounded.

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:17.676
<i>Lay down your weapons. Come out with
your hands above your head.</i>

01:34:17.752 --> 01:34:20.846
Sit down! Sit down, or I'm gonna
shoot somebody! Sit down!

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.389
I can't go back to prison.
I learned my lesson already.

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.482
Look what you started,
you big gorilla.

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:27.527
Look what I started? I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:31.031
Your idiot sons. If it wasn't for them, we'd
be in prison without a care in the world.

01:34:31.132 --> 01:34:35.091
If it wasn't for your goddamn,
long-winded, piece-of-shit letter...

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:38.104
<i>whining about how your daughter
doesn't come visit you no more...</i>

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:40.231
I never would've sent my boys
down here in the first place.

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:43.140
I never wrote any letter.

01:34:48.349 --> 01:34:50.340
Ma.

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:54.521
Who wrote what to whom?

01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:56.556
It's a moot point at this juncture.
Don't you think?

01:34:56.624 --> 01:35:00.219
<i>Especially given the gravity
of the situation...</i>

01:35:00.327 --> 01:35:02.625
outside.

01:35:02.697 --> 01:35:05.359
It just never ends with you.

01:35:08.035 --> 01:35:10.560
No.

01:35:10.638 --> 01:35:13.402
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:17.911
Nose is as long
as a telephone wire.

01:35:17.978 --> 01:35:22.711
<i>- Come on, Caesar. We're getting out of here.
- Don't make me shoot you.</i>

01:35:22.783 --> 01:35:25.377
- You shut up.
- Liar, liar.

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.444
What starts in fun
ends in tears.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:30.718
- Liar!
- Caesar, I said let's get out of here.

01:35:32.927 --> 01:35:35.361
You son of a bitch!

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:42.099
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:53.539
- Stay on the floor!
- Why don't you put some guns on me?

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:59.682
<i>Timmy!</i>

01:36:02.223 --> 01:36:05.659
- I got the guy. I'm the one who got the guy.
- We've got it all under control!

01:36:05.726 --> 01:36:10.595
- We've got it all under control!
- This is a big mistake. I can explain everything.

01:36:10.664 --> 01:36:12.825
Clovis, what the hell
did you do now?

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.368
<i>- Over here!
- Move! Move!</i>

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:18.303
Come on, come on.

01:36:18.372 --> 01:36:21.170
<i>Come on!
Get everybody out!</i>

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:26.877
We didn't do that,
did we?

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:35.545
Come on. Let's go.

01:36:35.656 --> 01:36:38.147
Get him out.

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:41.228
Line them
right up behind me.

01:36:41.295 --> 01:36:43.661
Come on. Keep moving.
Keep moving.

01:36:43.731 --> 01:36:47.030
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Keep it moving.

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:50.070
Come on, buddy.

01:36:50.137 --> 01:36:53.402
Send those escaped cons back to New York
before they ruin my Christmas.

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:56.642
<i>All the way in. Let's go.</i>

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.735
Watch the shirt.
It was a present.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:02.476
I'm a deputy, for Christ's sake! I demand
to know what the hell's going on here!

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.950
- Get some chairs out here.
- I didn't take Merlin.

01:37:05.019 --> 01:37:07.146
Pull out some of those chairs.
See how many we can get.

01:37:07.254 --> 01:37:09.484
Pull out some of those chairs.
That'll be fine.

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.459
All right, all right, all right.

01:37:24.705 --> 01:37:27.606
Shut up!

01:37:27.675 --> 01:37:31.042
Shut-- Quiet, please.

01:37:31.111 --> 01:37:33.705
Thank you.

01:37:36.150 --> 01:37:38.118
Father Gorenzel,
can we talk?

01:37:38.185 --> 01:37:41.086
Of course, Sarah.
I'm always available to talk.

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:43.156
Come in. Come in.

01:37:47.061 --> 01:37:50.030
You won't believe
what happened.

01:37:50.097 --> 01:37:53.794
I just got back from church. There was
a knock on the door, and this...

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:55.802
<i>was lying outside.</i>

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.168
This note was with it.

01:38:00.808 --> 01:38:05.211
''Please take this money.
It belongs to the people of Paradise.

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.204
The Three Wise Men.''

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:50.689
What did he say?

01:38:50.758 --> 01:38:53.386
He said
it's time to forgive.

01:38:56.230 --> 01:39:00.633
I'm sorry, Cliff, that I didn't
tell you everything about myself.

01:39:00.701 --> 01:39:03.693
It wouldn't have mattered
if you had.

01:39:06.373 --> 01:39:08.739
<i>Uh, Mrs. Anderson...</i>

01:39:08.809 --> 01:39:12.404
you were probably closest to the
perpetrators at the time of the robbery.

01:39:12.479 --> 01:39:14.947
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:19.577
Now, can you identify these three men
as the men who robbed the bank?

01:39:33.734 --> 01:39:35.725
No, I don't believe so.

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.406
How can you be so sure?

01:39:42.743 --> 01:39:46.873
Well, to begin with,
the robbers were wearing masks.

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:50.249
- Deputy Timmy?
- Sir.

01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:52.148
<i>You were in the house
at the time.</i>

01:39:52.219 --> 01:39:56.451
Why don't you tell the people
what the hell was going on?

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:02.253
They saved us from being hurt.
That's what happened.

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:05.093
What a crock
of stinking horse shit.

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:08.794
What do you know?
You slept through the whole thing.

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:13.135
I wanna know how exactly
you two seem to fit into all this.

01:40:13.207 --> 01:40:16.870
We're deputies, for Christ's sake.
Right, Bernie?

01:40:16.944 --> 01:40:19.378
We were trying to make an arrest.

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:24.440
These three were in my store a half hour before
the robbery, and they bought three ski masks.

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:27.919
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You withheld this information? Huh?

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:30.354
Oh,Jesus, uh--

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:34.554
Spill on aisle three.
Spill on aisle three.

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:36.596
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Spill on aisle three!

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:41.123
Spill on aisle three! Spill on aisle three!
Spill on aisle three!

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:43.829
- And then everyone was hustling sandals--
- Sit down! Sit down!

01:40:43.904 --> 01:40:47.533
- And I didn't-- What?
- Sit down.

01:40:47.608 --> 01:40:51.271
This was something I didn't quite
put together till just now.

01:40:51.345 --> 01:40:54.109
If these three guys aren't the crooks,
I'd like to know--

01:40:54.181 --> 01:40:56.115
- Sit down.
- Then where the hell...

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:58.777
are the three ski masks
they bought from my store?

01:41:02.556 --> 01:41:05.354
You wanna see
three ski masks?

01:41:05.426 --> 01:41:08.589
- Yeah.
- Is that it?

01:41:09.863 --> 01:41:12.923
I'll show you three ski masks.
Right in there.

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:19.599
Guess what?
There's one, two.

01:41:19.673 --> 01:41:22.267
Can we make it three?
Three ski--

01:41:22.342 --> 01:41:24.742
- Sit down, you clown.
- Okay.

01:41:30.851 --> 01:41:33.183
Everything I got
points to you three.

01:41:34.955 --> 01:41:37.788
<i>And don't give me
that ''Who, me?''look.</i>

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:40.190
I can't believe the only thing
I got you on is some parole violation.

01:41:40.260 --> 01:41:43.991
You didn't rob the bank? I wanna know exactly
where you were at the time of the robbery.

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:49.858
<i>They were with me
Christmas shopping.</i>

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:53.498
- What?
- It's true, Agent Peyser.

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:56.099
<i>I saw them all go together.</i>

01:41:56.176 --> 01:41:59.168
<i>Now I remember. I saw them too.</i>

01:42:01.748 --> 01:42:05.809
All right, all right.
Shut up! Shut up!

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:08.878
E- E-Ed, swallow that.

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:16.757
Christmas shopping.

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:19.993
Something tells me
I'm really getting jammed.

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:26.764
Let me guess.

01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.707
- It's the money from the robbery.
- Money.

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:33.974
Some-- Somebody...
dropped it outside... my front door.

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.380
<i>And you have no idea
who it might have been?</i>

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.750
<i>I don't know.
l- I was praying.</i>

01:42:40.854 --> 01:42:44.051
Oh, well, you're a priest.
Yeah.

01:42:44.158 --> 01:42:46.422
We'll talk later.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:54.760
What the hell's
going on in this town? Huh?

01:42:54.835 --> 01:42:58.362
What-What-What-
What-What-What--

01:43:13.954 --> 01:43:15.888
Come here.

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:17.924
Come here.

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:29.565
I don't know what the hell
happened in this town...

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:35.100
and it's obvious nobody here
is gonna tell me.

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:39.669
But I suspect that you three are
getting the break of a lifetime.

01:43:39.746 --> 01:43:43.409
Don't screw it up.
You understand?

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:46.353
'Cause it's not gonna
come around again.

01:43:46.388 --> 01:43:48.218
We won't, sir.

01:43:54.528 --> 01:43:58.828
Get out of here.

01:44:06.206 --> 01:44:09.141
<i>Ma.</i>

01:44:15.649 --> 01:44:17.583
Give me that.
You're gonna lose it.

01:44:19.853 --> 01:44:24.085
Well, I know
it sounds dumb, but...

01:44:25.726 --> 01:44:28.160
I'm really proud
of you three.

01:44:30.397 --> 01:44:32.422
Thanks, Ma.

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:35.059
And you're through with
all this nonsense, right?

01:44:35.135 --> 01:44:37.501
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:44:37.571 --> 01:44:39.505
You got it, Ma.

01:44:43.944 --> 01:44:45.844
Hey, what?

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:53.384
- I paid for that.
- Mine.

01:44:53.453 --> 01:44:56.149
- I paid for that.
- I didn't see nothing.

01:44:56.223 --> 01:44:58.157
- Tell her. I paid for it.
- No.

01:44:58.225 --> 01:45:00.216
<i>- You saw me buy it.
- I saw nothing.</i>

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:03.457
<i>- Tell it, Dave!
- I'm a blind man.</i>

01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:06.693
<i>- l-- l-- You're not--
- Who's lying now?</i>

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:20.478
- I guess I just want to say good-bye.
- I'm glad.

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:23.414
Did things work out
between you and your dad?

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:28.386
Well, I guess I got
nothing to hide now, so--

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:32.516
I don't know.
Maybe there's hope for him.

01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:35.322
Good.

01:45:38.098 --> 01:45:41.659
- It's my bus. I guess I better get going, right?
- Yeah.

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:48.532
Listen. How would you feel if I were
to settle down in a place like this?

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:51.543
A place like this?
Or this place?

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:54.876
Maybe I could manage some
little restaurant down here.

01:45:54.948 --> 01:45:57.576
Get you half off on lunch,
free coffee with every meal.

01:45:57.651 --> 01:46:02.054
I'll see you every morning in the bank
when I'm making my deposits.

01:46:02.122 --> 01:46:05.489
- Stay out of the bank, all right?
- Give me a chance.

01:46:10.497 --> 01:46:14.092
- Bill--
- Maybe we could hit it off.

01:46:14.167 --> 01:46:16.101
Look.

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:57.339
Check out Bill.
He's really going for it.

01:46:57.411 --> 01:47:00.642
- Hey, man, get a room.
- What for?

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:04.309
<i>- What--</i>

01:47:04.384 --> 01:47:06.682
Hey, Ma, what are you
so happy about?

01:47:06.753 --> 01:47:09.688
Well, your brother's
got himself a girlfriend.

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.690
- Is he coming with us?
- No.

01:47:11.758 --> 01:47:13.692
- Should we go get him?
- No, you sit down.

01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:16.058
- He's staying here.
- Oh.

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:20.225
Speaking of which,
when are you two gonna get hitched?

01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:23.463
- ''Get hitched.''
- We're not even attracted to each other.

01:47:29.976 --> 01:47:31.876
Hey.

01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:34.607
<i>Bye, Mom!</i>

01:47:35.816 --> 01:47:37.750
Bye, Dave! Bye, Alvin!

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:39.752
<i>Bye, sweetie!</i>
