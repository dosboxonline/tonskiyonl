I'm so glad you're here.

04:04.674 --> 04:06.036
Which way is the exit?

04:06.071 --> 04:07.576
[chuckles]
I must've taken a wrong turn.

04:07.611 --> 04:10.414
It's that defective mining bot,
Oreon Pix!

04:10.449 --> 04:11.877
Orion Pax.
Who cares?

04:11.912 --> 04:13.912
We told you
to never come back here!

04:13.947 --> 04:16.882
Why are we all yelling?
I'm gonna smash you!

04:16.917 --> 04:19.555
Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

04:19.590 --> 04:23.185
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

04:23.220 --> 04:25.220
Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

04:25.255 --> 04:28.058
He doesn't have a cog.
Let's give him a head start.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.929
Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

04:30.964 --> 04:31.897

Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

05:37.536 --> 05:38.931
[grunts] Hey!

05:39.802 --> 05:41.505

Ah, it's Orion.
Seriously, again?

06:00.955 --> 06:03.021
[chuckling] Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

06:03.056 --> 06:04.462
You want to give me
another one?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.860
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

06:06.895 --> 06:08.697
[grunts] Hey!
Watch where you're going!

06:08.732 --> 06:10.534
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

06:10.569 --> 06:12.096
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

06:12.131 --> 06:13.966
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

06:14.001 --> 06:15.473
What? Where'd he go?

06:15.508 --> 06:16.936
The filthy
red and blue bot?

06:16.971 --> 06:18.905
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

06:18.940 --> 06:20.610
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

06:20.645 --> 06:22.304
Where is he?
He went that way.

06:22.339 --> 06:24.482
When I get
my hands on that bot...

06:33.416 --> 06:35.218
All right, all clear.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.858
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

06:37.893 --> 06:39.530
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.664
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

06:41.699 --> 06:43.732
[laughs] Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.536
Almost died.
[laughs] It was wild.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.769
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

06:47.804 --> 06:49.133
Yes, it is.

06:49.168 --> 06:50.607
I need a new best friend.

06:50.642 --> 06:52.510
If there are clues
in our recorded history

06:52.545 --> 06:54.611
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

06:54.646 --> 06:56.008
they're in the archives.

06:56.043 --> 06:59.374
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

06:59.409 --> 07:01.486
is up on the surface
right now,

07:01.521 --> 07:04.720
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

07:04.755 --> 07:07.822
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

07:07.857 --> 07:09.384
Yeah, okay. [laughs]

07:09.419 --> 07:11.155
The sooner Energon
flows again,

07:11.190 --> 07:13.322
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

07:13.357 --> 07:15.665
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

07:15.700 --> 07:18.327
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

07:18.362 --> 07:22.837
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

07:22.872 --> 07:24.872
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

07:24.907 --> 07:26.643
you could transform
without a cog?

07:26.678 --> 07:28.436
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

07:28.471 --> 07:30.878
Took me three days
to pry you open.

07:30.913 --> 07:32.011
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

07:32.046 --> 07:33.551
Yeah, yeah.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.784
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.447
Hey, if we did have cogs--

07:39.482 --> 07:41.724
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

07:41.759 --> 07:43.660
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

07:43.695 --> 07:46.564
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

07:46.599 --> 07:48.830
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

07:48.865 --> 07:51.800
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

07:51.835 --> 07:53.670
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

07:53.705 --> 07:56.970
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

07:57.005 --> 07:58.576
[gasps] What?

07:58.611 --> 08:00.435
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

08:00.470 --> 08:02.041
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

08:02.076 --> 08:04.439
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.081
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

08:09.116 --> 08:10.984
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

08:11.019 --> 08:12.480
I know, buddy.

08:12.515 --> 08:16.660
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

08:18.356 --> 08:20.532
Thanks.
Always got your back.

08:56.031 --> 08:57.327
[all] So much, Elita-1!

08:57.362 --> 08:59.329

is my mining record?

08:59.364 --> 09:00.836
[all] So perfect, Elita-1!

09:11.013 --> 09:13.684
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.686
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

09:15.721 --> 09:17.479
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

09:17.514 --> 09:18.953
Apology accepted.

09:18.988 --> 09:20.691
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

09:20.726 --> 09:22.319
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.958

enough power in me

09:23.993 --> 09:25.861
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.522
You don't have
the touch or the power.

09:27.557 --> 09:29.733
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

09:29.768 --> 09:31.669

Mm-hmm.

Always ready.

protocol to the letter.

11:48.731 --> 11:50.632

I was the one
who broke the rules.

Next time,
why don't you stop and think

12:04.054 --> 12:05.548

I'm sorry!

[indistinct chatter]

12:08.421 --> 12:10.091
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

12:10.126 --> 12:13.325
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.262
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

12:16.297 --> 12:18.099

12:18.695 --> 12:19.903
Excuse me, sir.

Allow me.
[grunts]

12:21.841 --> 12:24.237

12:24.272 --> 12:26.778
[slow groan] Why?

12:39.584 --> 12:42.651
[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]

12:42.686 --> 12:44.191
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

12:44.226 --> 12:45.863
You know you were
out of line,

12:45.898 --> 12:48.096
talking back
to a superior like that.

12:48.131 --> 12:50.263
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

12:50.298 --> 12:52.067
[sighs]

12:52.102 --> 12:54.564
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

12:55.633 --> 12:59.008
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

13:00.979 --> 13:03.738
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

13:05.082 --> 13:06.851
I'm glad
you were there with me

13:06.886 --> 13:08.446

That was fun.

<i> Rest assured, I will find</i>

14:08.673 --> 14:10.442
<i> But that's in the future.</i>

14:10.477 --> 14:13.742

Psst! Hey, D.

[groans groggily]

14:53.157 --> 14:55.421
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

14:55.456 --> 14:58.358
[D-16] Whatever this is,
it better be good.

14:58.393 --> 15:00.063
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

15:00.098 --> 15:02.164
All right, what if...
what if...

15:02.199 --> 15:04.661
what if tomorrow

15:04.696 --> 15:08.500

in the Iacon 5000, huh?

15:09.536 --> 15:11.470
What if kill you
for waking me up?

15:11.505 --> 15:13.208
No, no, no, hear me out.

15:13.243 --> 15:14.671
We don't even have to win!

15:14.706 --> 15:16.046
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

15:16.081 --> 15:19.247
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

15:19.282 --> 15:21.249
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

15:21.284 --> 15:23.383
Not only would we
go down in history,

15:23.418 --> 15:26.716
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

15:26.751 --> 15:28.586
but we would show everyone
that we're--

15:28.621 --> 15:30.654
we're capable
of so much more!

15:30.689 --> 15:31.996
Or we get
publicly humiliated

15:32.031 --> 15:33.723
and then busted
back to tier one.

15:33.758 --> 15:36.660
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

15:36.695 --> 15:38.299
Pax...
Come on, D.

15:38.334 --> 15:39.762
Pax.

15:39.797 --> 15:42.633
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

15:42.668 --> 15:45.867
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

15:45.902 --> 15:47.209
we can't race.

15:47.244 --> 15:48.276
Come on, let's go.

15:48.311 --> 15:49.772
[sighs]

15:49.807 --> 15:51.279
All right, fine.

15:51.314 --> 15:53.017
Yeah, maybe you're right.

15:57.782 --> 15:59.089
Maybe.

16:00.752 --> 16:03.654
[D-16] The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

16:03.689 --> 16:05.227
[Orion] I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

16:05.262 --> 16:07.427
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

16:07.462 --> 16:09.099
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.200
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

16:11.235 --> 16:13.334
I wanted good seats.

16:13.369 --> 16:16.205
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

16:16.240 --> 16:17.976
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

16:18.836 --> 16:20.044

16:23.346 --> 16:26.743
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.349
Okay,
where are you taking me?

16:28.384 --> 16:30.219
[mechanical whirring]

16:30.254 --> 16:32.749
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.091
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.785
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

16:35.820 --> 16:37.358
like, we're joking around,

16:37.393 --> 16:39.954
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

16:39.989 --> 16:43.529

This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

17:04.849 --> 17:07.014
You did this for me?

17:07.049 --> 17:08.125
No.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.127

attacked our home.

17:51.599 --> 17:55.106
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

17:55.141 --> 17:57.735
and our Energon supply
dried up.

Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

18:01.840 --> 18:03.774

and sisters in arms.

18:03.809 --> 18:08.009
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

22:40.723 --> 22:42.855
how long do you think
we'll be here?

22:42.890 --> 22:44.120
I'm not talking to you.

22:49.292 --> 22:51.325
You know what?
I can't believe
you made me do that.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.800
We are so screwed!
Thought you weren't
talking to me.

22:53.835 --> 22:56.935
Hey, look, I know
it's all a big joke to you.
But not me.

22:56.970 --> 22:59.168
I was paying my dues.
I was going places.

22:59.203 --> 23:00.543
And now they're gonna
bust me down

23:00.578 --> 23:02.006
I-- I don't even know
how many tiers!

23:02.041 --> 23:03.810
I'm sorry, D.

23:03.845 --> 23:05.548
But come on,
didn't you feel it?

23:05.583 --> 23:07.649
Even for just a second,
didn't you feel liberated?

23:07.684 --> 23:09.277
Didn't you feel like
you were something else?

23:09.312 --> 23:12.148
Like you could be more
than what they say you are?

23:12.183 --> 23:14.854
Yeah, I felt it. I did.

23:16.088 --> 23:17.527
But it doesn't matter.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.892
We're going to get
punished and demoted.

23:19.927 --> 23:22.994
[sighs] Sentinel Prime
saw the whole thing.

23:23.029 --> 23:25.260
This is so embarrassing.
[metallic clanking]

23:30.201 --> 23:32.267
[electronic beeping, whirring]

23:39.078 --> 23:39.945
It's clear.

23:44.017 --> 23:45.379
Orion Pax.

23:46.151 --> 23:47.854
D-16.

23:47.889 --> 23:49.493
What you two did today

23:49.528 --> 23:52.089
was one of the
craziest things
I've ever seen.

23:52.124 --> 23:54.597
Sir, this is all my idea,
and we're so sorry.

23:54.632 --> 23:56.027
I loved it!

23:56.062 --> 23:57.094
You did?

23:57.129 --> 23:58.964
How could anyone
not love it?

23:58.999 --> 24:01.736
You gave my best racers
a real run for their money.

24:01.771 --> 24:04.134
So we're not
getting demoted?

24:04.169 --> 24:05.333
Demoted?

24:05.368 --> 24:08.171
[laughing]

24:08.206 --> 24:10.074
[both laughing nervously]

24:10.109 --> 24:11.438
Demoted.

24:11.473 --> 24:12.714
[laughter continues]

24:12.749 --> 24:14.441
What is happening?

24:14.476 --> 24:17.048
[laughs awkwardly]

24:17.083 --> 24:19.248
The fact of the matter
is we're halfway
into the first shift

24:19.283 --> 24:24.627
since the race ended
and that mining crew
has already reached 150% quota.

24:24.662 --> 24:26.761
You inspired them
to work harder!

24:26.796 --> 24:28.862
Sentinel Prime, sir,

24:28.897 --> 24:33.130
we joined the race
to show everyone our potential.

24:33.165 --> 24:35.066
That we bots can do
more than just mine--

24:35.101 --> 24:38.399
Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

24:38.434 --> 24:40.137
Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

24:40.172 --> 24:42.436
speak to your brethren, and
help them see their potential.

24:42.471 --> 24:44.581
[laughs] Wow! Okay, great.

24:44.616 --> 24:46.374
[stammering]
That sounds incredible.

24:46.409 --> 24:48.277
I would love to--
Sir, it's time.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.916
Ah, yes.

24:49.951 --> 24:51.588
I'm sorry, friends.

24:51.623 --> 24:53.656
We're preparing
our next travel
to the surface.

24:53.691 --> 24:56.450
But in the meantime,
I've got a treat for you.

24:56.485 --> 24:59.596
Hang tight.
Airachnid, have someone
escort these heroes

24:59.631 --> 25:01.455
to my personal
service facilities.

25:02.326 --> 25:04.458
Best care in Iacon.

25:04.493 --> 25:06.295
Until next time, legends.

25:10.103 --> 25:14.072
Sentinel Prime. [laughs]
The Sentinel Prime!

25:14.107 --> 25:16.173
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.813
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

25:18.848 --> 25:19.979
and we're gonna go--
[heavy footsteps]

25:20.014 --> 25:22.817
[growling] Miners!

25:23.347 --> 25:25.886
Hi, Darkwing.

25:26.955 --> 25:29.450
[Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
[D-16] No! [yells]

25:31.355 --> 25:33.025
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

25:33.060 --> 25:35.522
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

25:35.557 --> 25:38.833
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

25:38.868 --> 25:40.329
I'll make sure of that.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.639
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

25:42.674 --> 25:44.773
[groans]
I hate that guy!

25:45.303 --> 25:46.841
[clattering]

25:50.814 --> 25:52.847
[clattering continues]

25:58.547 --> 26:00.316
You! How did you get down here?

26:00.351 --> 26:02.054
There's no access to this level.

26:02.089 --> 26:04.089
There is nobody
down here but me.

26:04.124 --> 26:06.630
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

26:06.665 --> 26:09.864
You're others!
You're not... me!

26:09.899 --> 26:12.603
You're here,
and you're not me!

26:12.638 --> 26:14.836
[laughs]

26:14.871 --> 26:16.838
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

26:16.873 --> 26:19.335
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.535
I just haven't had
a lot of company

26:21.570 --> 26:23.647
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

26:23.682 --> 26:26.914
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

26:26.949 --> 26:28.575
That's what I thought!

26:28.610 --> 26:31.545
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

26:31.580 --> 26:33.316
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

26:33.351 --> 26:34.724
How long have you
been down here?

26:34.759 --> 26:36.385
How long have I been here?
[laughs]

26:36.420 --> 26:39.586
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

26:39.621 --> 26:43.326
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

26:43.361 --> 26:45.196
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

26:45.231 --> 26:48.232
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

26:48.267 --> 26:49.706
But you can call me B.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.367
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

26:51.402 --> 26:54.073
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

26:54.108 --> 26:57.846
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

26:57.881 --> 26:59.210
But if you have any critiques--

26:59.245 --> 27:02.213
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

27:02.248 --> 27:04.149
Great question. You don't.

27:04.184 --> 27:05.755
We don't?
Nope.

27:05.790 --> 27:08.054
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

27:08.089 --> 27:12.124
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

27:12.159 --> 27:15.160
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

27:15.195 --> 27:16.733
Which is?
Oh!

27:16.768 --> 27:19.670
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

27:19.705 --> 27:21.463
onto the conveyor belt.

27:21.498 --> 27:24.400
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

27:24.435 --> 27:27.106
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

27:27.141 --> 27:29.141
So you watch garbage burn.

27:29.176 --> 27:30.637
Yes!

27:30.672 --> 27:32.276
It is so great
that you're here now.

27:32.311 --> 27:34.179
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

27:34.214 --> 27:36.016
And then tell you
everything about me!

27:36.051 --> 27:38.920
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

27:38.955 --> 27:40.251
with one or two
new best friends.

27:40.286 --> 27:42.451
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

27:42.486 --> 27:44.123
[splutters]
Where are my manners?

27:44.158 --> 27:45.927
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

27:45.962 --> 27:47.929
Hey, guys, we've got company!

27:49.163 --> 27:51.735
This is EP-508,

27:51.770 --> 27:55.497
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

27:55.532 --> 27:57.906
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

27:57.941 --> 27:59.875
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

27:59.910 --> 28:02.174
Um, they're not real.

28:02.209 --> 28:04.814
[laughing]
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

28:04.849 --> 28:06.277
It's just
you've been down here a--

28:06.312 --> 28:07.850
No, I was talking to Steve.
[beeps and whirs]

28:07.885 --> 28:09.313
[indistinct robotic speech]
[laughs]

28:09.348 --> 28:10.479
Classic Steve.

28:10.514 --> 28:12.283
What is that?
Look at this guy.

28:12.318 --> 28:15.319
[mocks electronic speech]
It's coming from inside.

28:15.959 --> 28:17.827
Oh! Steve! No!

28:17.862 --> 28:21.028
I am so sorry.
[dramatically] Steve, no!

28:21.063 --> 28:23.129
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

28:25.969 --> 28:28.035
[voice over transmission]
<i> Quintesson ambush!</i>

28:28.070 --> 28:31.170
<i> Calling the High Guard</i>
<i> for immediate support.</i>
<i> Immediate support!</i>

28:31.843 --> 28:33.436
That's Alpha Trion.

28:33.471 --> 28:34.976
One of the Primes?

28:35.011 --> 28:37.308
<i> Repeat,</i>
<i> Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

28:37.343 --> 28:40.146
It's an SOS message.
<i> Protect the Matrix!</i>

28:40.181 --> 28:43.413
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>
<i>Sending location coordinates.</i>

28:46.924 --> 28:49.320
Holy Primus!

28:49.355 --> 28:52.620
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

28:52.655 --> 28:57.229
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

28:57.264 --> 29:00.661
Which means
this is where we could find

29:00.696 --> 29:03.004
the Matrix of Leadership.

29:03.039 --> 29:06.535
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.174
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

29:08.209 --> 29:10.946
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

29:10.981 --> 29:13.740
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

29:13.775 --> 29:15.181
You already tried
to "show everyone"

29:15.216 --> 29:16.710
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

29:16.745 --> 29:18.085
which got us
stuck down here

29:18.120 --> 29:20.516
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

29:21.750 --> 29:23.453
really cool guy.

29:23.488 --> 29:25.686
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

29:25.721 --> 29:27.490
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

29:27.525 --> 29:29.228
It's dangerous!

29:29.263 --> 29:31.593
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

29:31.628 --> 29:33.463
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

29:33.498 --> 29:36.532
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

29:36.567 --> 29:37.940
Forever? This is great!

29:37.975 --> 29:40.173
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

29:40.208 --> 29:42.109
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

29:42.144 --> 29:44.243
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

29:44.278 --> 29:45.772
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

29:45.807 --> 29:47.510
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

29:47.545 --> 29:49.919
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

29:49.954 --> 29:54.022
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

29:54.057 --> 29:56.992
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

29:57.027 --> 29:59.896
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.162
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

30:02.197 --> 30:04.692
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

30:04.727 --> 30:06.870
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

30:06.905 --> 30:09.004
Easy. I know a way.

30:10.172 --> 30:11.765
But it won't be easy.

30:12.735 --> 30:14.735
[D-16]
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

30:14.770 --> 30:17.111
[Orion] Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

30:17.146 --> 30:19.608
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!

30:20.677 --> 30:22.776
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

30:22.811 --> 30:24.954
that go all the way
to the surface.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.418
[D-16] Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

30:27.453 --> 30:29.816
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

30:29.851 --> 30:32.291
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

30:39.762 --> 30:41.399
[worker] That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

30:41.434 --> 30:42.972
[door whirs, thuds]

30:46.670 --> 30:49.143
[Elita] Hold up! One more.

30:53.215 --> 30:54.511
I'll lock it down.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.712
[electronic beeps, clicks]

31:02.587 --> 31:05.819
[laughs]
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

31:05.854 --> 31:08.965
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Got her!
[grunting]

31:11.035 --> 31:12.199
No, wait, I--

31:12.234 --> 31:13.530
Elita! Stop!

31:13.565 --> 31:15.334
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

31:15.369 --> 31:16.566
Security! Sound the ala--

31:21.177 --> 31:22.869
[grunts angrily]

31:22.904 --> 31:24.882
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.216
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

31:29.251 --> 31:31.383
So am I. To ruin your life.

31:37.424 --> 31:39.930
[yells]
[all grunt]

31:41.923 --> 31:45.001
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

31:45.729 --> 31:47.861
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

31:47.896 --> 31:50.402
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

31:50.437 --> 31:51.601
Well, she's gone.

31:52.406 --> 31:54.439
[all grunting]

32:01.811 --> 32:03.052
[groans]

32:06.453 --> 32:07.881
Whoa!

32:07.916 --> 32:10.818
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

32:10.853 --> 32:11.962
Climb faster!

32:20.104 --> 32:21.972
[all groaning]

32:26.935 --> 32:28.275
Gotcha!
[grunts]

33:01.541 --> 33:03.640
Ah, the surface.

33:03.675 --> 33:06.181
It's beautiful.

33:08.053 --> 33:12.121
[B-127] I am speechless.

33:13.421 --> 33:15.619
Elita, listen to me.

33:15.654 --> 33:17.885
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

33:17.920 --> 33:19.920
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

33:19.955 --> 33:23.330
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

33:23.365 --> 33:25.827
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

33:25.862 --> 33:27.598
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.073
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

33:30.108 --> 33:31.470

Look.

33:31.505 --> 33:33.670
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

33:33.705 --> 33:35.573
and then we found this message.

33:35.608 --> 33:37.806
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

the locations ourselves.

I'll go on your little quest

But I carry the map, I navigate,
and if this leads to nothing,

35:45.936 --> 35:47.309

35:47.344 --> 35:49.971

Am I saying that right?

Wanted to formally
introduce myself.

36:08.959 --> 36:12.598
I'm B-127. You kneed me
in the face earlier, back there.

36:12.633 --> 36:15.271
You can call me B,
or Badassatron.

36:15.306 --> 36:17.031
It's a nickname
some of the guys gave me.

36:17.066 --> 36:19.440
I don't know. I didn't give it
to myself or anything.

36:19.475 --> 36:22.542

49:52.419 --> 49:54.617
I swear I will
get you the rest.

50:00.328 --> 50:02.163
Triple-time
every mining shift.

50:02.198 --> 50:04.858
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

50:04.893 --> 50:06.530
All of it! Let's go.

50:15.904 --> 50:17.970
[ship rumbling]

50:22.779 --> 50:26.385
Now you have seen the truth.

50:29.852 --> 50:31.324
Every day...

50:32.360 --> 50:37.924
Every single day
of my life

50:37.959 --> 50:40.498
has been a lie.

50:41.336 --> 50:42.995
My God, I knew it!

50:43.030 --> 50:45.866
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

50:45.901 --> 50:48.374
He deceived everyone.

50:48.409 --> 50:53.544
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

50:53.579 --> 50:55.315
I can't believe it.

50:55.350 --> 50:56.844
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

50:56.879 --> 50:58.681
I just saw it,
but I still...

50:58.716 --> 51:00.716
I can't believe it.

51:00.751 --> 51:03.719
Sentinel lied

51:03.754 --> 51:05.853
to my face.
[Orion]
It was all a sham.

51:05.888 --> 51:08.691
How could we
have been so gullible?

51:08.726 --> 51:12.332
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

51:12.367 --> 51:13.729
[thudding]

51:13.764 --> 51:15.236
[grunting]

51:17.031 --> 51:19.339
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

51:19.935 --> 51:21.671
Me? What did I do?

51:21.706 --> 51:23.508
You just had
to go to the surface,

51:23.543 --> 51:25.543
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

51:25.578 --> 51:28.117
You just had to break protocol!

51:28.152 --> 51:30.383
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

51:30.946 --> 51:32.550
I care!

51:32.585 --> 51:35.190
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

51:35.225 --> 51:36.686
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

51:36.721 --> 51:39.051
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

51:39.086 --> 51:42.758
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

51:42.793 --> 51:45.761
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

51:45.796 --> 51:47.862
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

51:47.897 --> 51:49.534
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

51:49.569 --> 51:51.305
That's the whole thing!

51:51.340 --> 51:53.703
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

51:53.738 --> 51:58.037
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

51:58.072 --> 51:59.412
Don't you want
to stop him?

51:59.447 --> 52:01.315
No, I want to kill him!

52:02.582 --> 52:04.252
I want to put Sentinel in chains

52:04.287 --> 52:05.913
and march him
through the mines

52:05.948 --> 52:09.455
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

52:09.490 --> 52:13.393
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

52:14.660 --> 52:16.088
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

52:16.123 --> 52:17.727
what I want, right, Pax?

52:17.762 --> 52:21.335
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

52:22.998 --> 52:28.177
[D-16 chuckles bitterly]
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

52:29.477 --> 52:34.447
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

52:34.482 --> 52:37.384
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

52:37.419 --> 52:40.354
and this slot's
always been empty.

52:40.389 --> 52:42.389
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

52:42.424 --> 52:45.986
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

52:46.021 --> 52:50.430
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

52:50.465 --> 52:55.633
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

52:55.668 --> 52:57.602
He took them from us.

52:57.637 --> 53:00.836
What defines a Transformer...
[grunts]

53:00.871 --> 53:03.311
...is not the cog
in his chest

53:03.346 --> 53:08.349
but the spark
that resides in their core.

53:08.384 --> 53:13.684
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

53:14.588 --> 53:18.183
My fellow Primes had that spark.

53:18.218 --> 53:22.231
And I see their strength
in you.

53:23.795 --> 53:30.305
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.439
Prima.

53:33.904 --> 53:34.969
Onyx.

53:35.576 --> 53:37.103
Alchemist.

53:37.875 --> 53:39.314
Micronus.

53:39.349 --> 53:45.144
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

53:45.179 --> 53:49.148
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

53:51.889 --> 53:54.725
[electronic whirring]

54:03.263 --> 54:05.274
[electronic whirring continues]

54:16.012 --> 54:20.421
They were one. You are one.

54:20.456 --> 54:23.292
All are one!

54:36.472 --> 54:39.935
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

54:39.970 --> 54:43.444
The ability
to change your world.

54:43.479 --> 54:48.614
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

54:50.244 --> 54:51.716
[laughs]

54:52.279 --> 54:53.553
[heavy thud]

54:53.588 --> 54:54.884
They've found us.

54:54.919 --> 54:57.590
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

54:57.625 --> 55:01.462
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

55:04.665 --> 55:07.963
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

55:07.998 --> 55:10.438
Use it to reveal the truth.

55:11.606 --> 55:12.803
We will.

55:12.838 --> 55:14.937
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

55:14.972 --> 55:17.808
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

55:17.843 --> 55:19.304
[thudding boom]
We're out of time.

55:19.339 --> 55:20.943
We got to move!

55:20.978 --> 55:23.715
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

55:23.750 --> 55:26.278
Your fight will come,
my friend.

55:26.313 --> 55:29.655
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

55:29.690 --> 55:31.591
But this fight...
[heavy booming thud]

55:31.626 --> 55:33.494
This fight is mine.

55:33.529 --> 55:35.991
Now go!
[thudding continues]

55:47.004 --> 55:48.410
Stand down, old timer.

55:48.445 --> 55:51.413
Ah. Old, you say?

55:51.448 --> 55:53.349
[rumbling]

55:58.114 --> 55:59.388
[laserfire pulsing]

56:04.824 --> 56:06.186
[roars]

56:10.390 --> 56:11.323
[electrical crackling]

56:14.196 --> 56:15.932
[laserfire pulsing]

56:15.967 --> 56:17.230
[roars]

56:21.236 --> 56:23.203
Not too old for you.

56:25.746 --> 56:27.240
[roaring]

56:29.046 --> 56:30.210
We need to hurry!

56:30.245 --> 56:31.915
I still think
we have better odds

56:31.950 --> 56:33.686
fighting than outrunning them.

56:33.721 --> 56:36.722
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

56:36.757 --> 56:39.692
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

56:39.727 --> 56:41.353
On three. One--

56:41.388 --> 56:43.025
[all yelling]

56:43.060 --> 56:47.227
[faint yelling, grunting]

56:49.935 --> 56:50.835
Ah!

56:52.267 --> 56:54.443
[laserfire pulsing]

56:55.105 --> 56:56.643
[grunting]

56:56.678 --> 56:58.172
How do we use these things?

56:58.207 --> 57:00.108
I don't know. Just try.

57:00.143 --> 57:02.011
[straining]

57:02.046 --> 57:04.684
It's working. Ha! It's working!

57:05.445 --> 57:06.521
My head! My head!

57:06.556 --> 57:07.588
Whoa!

57:07.623 --> 57:09.425
Help! Help!

57:14.091 --> 57:16.630
This is not faster!

57:18.029 --> 57:19.765
[yells, grunts]

57:19.800 --> 57:21.536
Oh, come on!

57:21.571 --> 57:24.638
And transform!

57:25.300 --> 57:26.937
[yelling]

57:26.972 --> 57:28.675
Wheels! I need wheels!

57:29.612 --> 57:32.140
[laserfire pulsing]

57:34.342 --> 57:35.682
[Elita yelling]

57:38.478 --> 57:39.378
Whoa.

57:44.990 --> 57:47.089
[audio slows]

57:47.124 --> 57:49.663
[mechanical whirring]

57:52.767 --> 57:54.294
[B-127 yelling]

58:00.104 --> 58:02.643
[mechanical whirring]
Ha! [grunts]

58:03.943 --> 58:05.580
[grunts, laughs]

58:05.615 --> 58:07.109
Oh, wow.

58:07.144 --> 58:08.649
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

58:08.684 --> 58:11.443
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

58:11.478 --> 58:13.247
[overlapping chatter]

58:13.282 --> 58:14.556
[laser blast]

58:15.218 --> 58:17.482
[engine humming]

58:17.517 --> 58:18.659
[mechanical whirring]

58:18.694 --> 58:19.891
Yes!

58:19.926 --> 58:22.927
[laughing deliriously]

58:22.962 --> 58:24.489
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

58:24.524 --> 58:28.163
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

58:28.198 --> 58:30.330
We transform!

58:30.365 --> 58:31.969
Oh, hey! I know.

58:32.004 --> 58:34.070
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

58:34.105 --> 58:35.269
Looks like the fastest way

58:35.304 --> 58:37.007
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

58:37.042 --> 58:38.503
Hey, what are you doing?

58:38.538 --> 58:40.208
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

58:40.243 --> 58:43.046
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

58:44.346 --> 58:49.723
I... got... it.

58:51.727 --> 58:52.990
Okay.

58:56.897 --> 58:58.259
Follow me.

59:04.003 --> 59:05.200
[wheezes]

59:05.235 --> 59:07.367
Alpha Trion!

59:07.402 --> 59:10.205
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

59:11.076 --> 59:13.010
You look horrible.

59:13.782 --> 59:18.147
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

59:18.182 --> 59:21.414
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

59:21.449 --> 59:25.220
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

59:25.255 --> 59:26.694
Anything to get
out of working for you

59:26.729 --> 59:29.059
and that boring
council of elders.

59:29.094 --> 59:31.259
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

59:31.294 --> 59:33.393
spend half the day
losing a war

59:33.428 --> 59:38.233
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

59:38.268 --> 59:39.531
And now look at you.

59:39.566 --> 59:43.370
Hear my words:
You will fall.

59:43.405 --> 59:45.438
And a new Prime will rise--

59:45.473 --> 59:46.978
There you go again.

59:47.013 --> 59:49.915
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

59:49.950 --> 59:51.246
[groans]

59:51.281 --> 59:52.720
There were others
in the cave with you.

59:52.755 --> 59:53.787
Who are they?

59:53.822 --> 59:56.922
They are to be your undoing.

59:56.957 --> 01:00:01.355
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:03.929
[pained grunt]
[electrical crackling]

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:06.228
[body thuds]

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:10.463
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

01:00:10.498 --> 01:00:12.102
You heard me, right?

01:00:12.137 --> 01:00:14.533
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

01:00:14.568 --> 01:00:17.437
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

01:00:18.077 --> 01:00:19.043
[sighs]

01:00:19.078 --> 01:00:21.276
Okay. Hunt down the others.

01:00:21.311 --> 01:00:22.618
With pleasure.

01:00:31.926 --> 01:00:34.454
[engines humming]

01:00:39.263 --> 01:00:40.460
Hey, buddy.

01:00:41.133 --> 01:00:42.495
Oh. Hey.

01:00:44.169 --> 01:00:47.302
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

01:00:47.337 --> 01:00:51.636
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

01:00:51.671 --> 01:00:55.475
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:59.688
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

01:00:59.723 --> 01:01:02.790
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

01:01:02.825 --> 01:01:04.792
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.058
They worship Sentinel.

01:01:07.093 --> 01:01:09.093
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

01:01:09.128 --> 01:01:11.799
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:13.900
I trusted Sentinel!

01:01:14.496 --> 01:01:15.594
With everything.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:22.073
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

01:01:24.671 --> 01:01:26.407
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

01:01:26.442 --> 01:01:27.606
[electrical crackling]

01:01:27.641 --> 01:01:28.915
[grunting]

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.279
[electronic sputtering]

01:01:37.057 --> 01:01:39.255
[voice] All right,
wake them up.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.685
[gasps]

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.258
[breathes heavily]

01:01:47.067 --> 01:01:48.462
[grunts]

01:02:02.181 --> 01:02:05.446
Now, are you spies

01:02:06.581 --> 01:02:09.758
or just incompetent lackeys?

01:02:09.793 --> 01:02:12.585
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.930
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

01:02:16.965 --> 01:02:21.495
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.497
[muffled indistinct speech]

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:26.038
Uh, why is he gagged?

01:02:26.073 --> 01:02:27.732
He wouldn't stop talking.

01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:29.272
[muffled speech continues]
Even when he was
unconscious?

01:02:29.307 --> 01:02:31.505
Especially when
he was unconscious!

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.748
Enough!

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.344
Two options for you!

01:02:35.379 --> 01:02:40.052
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

01:02:40.087 --> 01:02:42.714
and really make sure
you feel it.

01:02:42.749 --> 01:02:43.858
Or two:

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:45.651
In exchange
for a quick death,

01:02:45.686 --> 01:02:48.093
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

01:02:48.128 --> 01:02:50.095
access to the mines

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:53.802
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:55.331
Who exactly are you guys?

01:02:55.366 --> 01:02:57.036
[muffled grunting, straining]

01:02:57.071 --> 01:02:58.103
Ah!

01:02:58.138 --> 01:03:01.172
The Cybertronian High Guard!

01:03:01.207 --> 01:03:03.075
[growls] I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.210
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

01:03:06.245 --> 01:03:08.949
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

01:03:08.984 --> 01:03:12.381
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.185
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:17.089
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

01:03:17.124 --> 01:03:19.718
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

01:03:19.753 --> 01:03:21.291
Silence!

01:03:21.326 --> 01:03:23.425
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.426
Whoo!

01:03:24.461 --> 01:03:26.263
We were once the High Guard.

01:03:26.298 --> 01:03:30.003
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

01:03:30.038 --> 01:03:32.907
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

01:03:32.942 --> 01:03:35.635
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:37.373
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:41.080
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

01:03:41.115 --> 01:03:43.577
I'm just saying we're allies.

01:03:43.612 --> 01:03:45.645
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.715
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:53.862
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:58.724
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

01:03:58.759 --> 01:04:00.693
[all cheering]

01:04:00.728 --> 01:04:03.597
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.533
Yeah. Just a little.

01:04:05.568 --> 01:04:06.908
Hey!

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.470
What are you doing?

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.706
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

01:04:13.741 --> 01:04:17.644
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

01:04:17.679 --> 01:04:19.844
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

01:04:19.879 --> 01:04:22.583
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

01:04:22.618 --> 01:04:24.849
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

01:04:24.884 --> 01:04:26.851
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

01:04:26.886 --> 01:04:28.358
Today!

01:04:28.393 --> 01:04:31.966
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:36.003
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:37.664
[chuckles] Is that right?

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:40.832
Well, how can you say so

01:04:40.867 --> 01:04:42.801
with my head in your teeth?

01:04:42.836 --> 01:04:44.473
[grunts]
D!

01:04:44.508 --> 01:04:46.871
[grunts]
[excited chatter]

01:04:46.906 --> 01:04:48.081
[both grunting]

01:04:51.383 --> 01:04:52.415
Whoa!

01:04:52.450 --> 01:04:54.054
[grunting]
[mechanical whir]

01:04:54.089 --> 01:04:55.682
[growls]
[grunts]

01:04:57.554 --> 01:04:58.883
Hit me!

01:04:58.918 --> 01:05:02.161
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!
[crowd cheers]

01:05:02.196 --> 01:05:05.692
[laughs]
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

01:05:07.894 --> 01:05:12.864
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

01:05:12.899 --> 01:05:14.943
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

01:05:14.978 --> 01:05:17.737
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

01:05:17.772 --> 01:05:20.773
[yells angrily]

01:05:20.808 --> 01:05:22.544
[mechanical whirring]

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:31.454
[panting]

01:05:35.394 --> 01:05:37.460
Please! I beg you!

01:05:37.495 --> 01:05:40.298
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

01:05:42.632 --> 01:05:44.764
Bear witness!

01:05:44.799 --> 01:05:47.569
This is the last time
I show mercy!

01:05:47.604 --> 01:05:50.242
Decide right now:

01:05:50.277 --> 01:05:54.873
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

01:05:54.908 --> 01:05:58.217
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

01:05:58.252 --> 01:06:01.781
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

01:06:01.816 --> 01:06:04.256
[cheers, chanting]

01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:08.854
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

01:06:08.889 --> 01:06:10.889
[chanting fades]

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:20.008
[distant rumbling]

01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.639
[all screaming]

01:06:28.645 --> 01:06:30.348
[laserfire pulsing]

01:06:35.718 --> 01:06:36.948
B, come on!

01:06:37.522 --> 01:06:39.126
[B-127 yelling]

01:06:45.992 --> 01:06:47.464
[mechanical whirring]

01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:56.836
[grunts]

01:07:01.975 --> 01:07:04.745
[Airachnid] Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

01:07:21.533 --> 01:07:23.038
[grunts angrily]

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:25.403
[D-16 yelling]

01:07:29.343 --> 01:07:30.870
[mechanical whirring]

01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:34.379
[grunts]

01:07:36.515 --> 01:07:37.415
Elita, get down!

01:07:41.454 --> 01:07:42.519
[grunts]

01:07:56.469 --> 01:07:58.964
[Orion coughs, clears throat]

01:08:00.033 --> 01:08:02.671
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

01:08:02.706 --> 01:08:05.212
[groans]
Where are the others?

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:09.007
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

01:08:09.042 --> 01:08:10.811
They got D-16 and B.

01:08:10.846 --> 01:08:12.681
Oh, no.

01:08:12.716 --> 01:08:15.255
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

01:08:16.115 --> 01:08:17.257
[sighs]

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:18.984
Our proof.

01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:20.425
It's gone.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:23.560
So, what do we do now?

01:08:23.595 --> 01:08:25.166
D was right.

01:08:25.201 --> 01:08:27.762
About what?
Everything.

01:08:27.797 --> 01:08:31.403
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

01:08:31.966 --> 01:08:33.141
It's all my fault.

01:08:33.176 --> 01:08:35.066
I should have
stayed on protocol.

01:08:36.542 --> 01:08:37.574
[sighs]

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:44.746
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

01:08:44.781 --> 01:08:45.813
Are you listening?

01:08:48.422 --> 01:08:49.817
I'm better than you.

01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:52.457
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

01:08:53.328 --> 01:08:55.086
I'm better than you
in every way,

01:08:55.121 --> 01:08:57.594
except you have hope.

01:08:57.629 --> 01:09:01.301
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

01:09:01.336 --> 01:09:05.272
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.098
[chuckles] Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

01:09:07.133 --> 01:09:08.869
My point is,

01:09:08.904 --> 01:09:13.137
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

01:09:13.172 --> 01:09:16.250
This blind optimism
that you have

01:09:16.285 --> 01:09:20.617
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

01:09:21.686 --> 01:09:23.488
that are also extremely stupid.

01:09:23.523 --> 01:09:26.051
First time
giving a pep talk?

01:09:26.086 --> 01:09:27.822
You're inspiring.

01:09:27.857 --> 01:09:31.199
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:35.302
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:39.339
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:41.572
Listen to me.

01:09:42.476 --> 01:09:43.673
We can do this.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.349
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

01:09:49.384 --> 01:09:52.077
If we intercepted one--

01:09:52.112 --> 01:09:55.289
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

01:09:55.324 --> 01:10:00.019
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

01:10:02.056 --> 01:10:04.364
I was afraid
you'd say that.

01:10:04.399 --> 01:10:07.961
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

01:10:07.996 --> 01:10:11.239
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

01:10:11.274 --> 01:10:13.538
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

01:10:13.573 --> 01:10:16.970
[pained grunt]
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

01:10:17.005 --> 01:10:20.215
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:24.043
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

01:10:24.078 --> 01:10:25.715
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:28.751
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

01:10:28.786 --> 01:10:33.723
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

01:10:33.758 --> 01:10:36.891
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

01:10:36.926 --> 01:10:38.530
Why should we follow you?

01:10:39.698 --> 01:10:41.368
We will follow you.

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:44.602
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

01:10:44.637 --> 01:10:46.637
What is our first move?

01:10:46.672 --> 01:10:47.803
[quietly] We roll out.

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:50.410
What?

01:10:50.445 --> 01:10:51.840
Louder.

01:10:51.875 --> 01:10:54.282
[boldly]
Transform and roll out!

01:11:04.184 --> 01:11:07.823
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

01:11:07.858 --> 01:11:11.431
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

01:11:11.466 --> 01:11:13.301
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:16.898
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

01:11:16.933 --> 01:11:19.439
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

01:11:19.474 --> 01:11:20.770
Oh-ho-ho!

01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:23.707
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

01:11:23.742 --> 01:11:25.907
[high-pitch]
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

01:11:25.942 --> 01:11:27.414
so that your death
is painful!
[laughs]

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.712
You'll regret
the day you were--

01:11:28.747 --> 01:11:30.681
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

01:11:30.716 --> 01:11:33.717
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

01:11:33.752 --> 01:11:37.622
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

01:11:37.657 --> 01:11:39.723
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

01:11:39.758 --> 01:11:42.462
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

01:11:42.497 --> 01:11:46.158
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

01:11:46.193 --> 01:11:48.600
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

01:11:48.635 --> 01:11:49.898
None of that is true!

01:11:49.933 --> 01:11:51.504
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

01:11:51.539 --> 01:11:54.441
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

01:11:54.476 --> 01:11:58.269
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

01:11:58.304 --> 01:11:59.314
[thud reverberates]

01:12:07.016 --> 01:12:09.423
Well, well.
What's this about?

01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:12.987
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

01:12:13.022 --> 01:12:14.956
Feeling confident, are we?

01:12:14.991 --> 01:12:18.190
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

01:12:18.225 --> 01:12:19.290
Please.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:23.536
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:25.703
You took it all.

01:12:27.069 --> 01:12:28.442
I sure did.

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.839
[grunts]

01:12:29.874 --> 01:12:31.511
[gasps]
[groans]

01:12:31.546 --> 01:12:33.909
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

01:12:35.308 --> 01:12:38.386
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:41.279
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.755
That's why,
after I killed him,

01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:48.022
I took his cog for myself.

01:12:48.057 --> 01:12:50.530
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

01:12:50.565 --> 01:12:52.829
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

01:12:52.864 --> 01:12:55.700
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

01:12:55.735 --> 01:12:56.767
Here.

01:12:58.001 --> 01:13:01.233
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

01:13:01.268 --> 01:13:02.773
[electrical crackling]

01:13:02.808 --> 01:13:06.007
[pained shouts, groans]

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:22.529
Okay. [sighs]

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:25.092
[stammers] I can do this.

01:13:38.745 --> 01:13:42.241
[miner] You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

01:13:42.276 --> 01:13:43.979
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

01:13:44.014 --> 01:13:46.278
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

01:13:46.313 --> 01:13:49.721
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

01:13:49.756 --> 01:13:50.887
[aggressive thud]

01:13:53.353 --> 01:13:55.386
[triumphant electronic jingle]

01:13:55.421 --> 01:13:57.388
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

01:13:57.423 --> 01:13:58.598
[miner] That can't be him.

01:13:58.633 --> 01:13:59.698
[Jazz] Is that...

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.393
It can't be.

01:14:02.428 --> 01:14:04.934
Orion?
Jazz.

01:14:04.969 --> 01:14:06.364
Is it really you?

01:14:06.399 --> 01:14:08.773
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

01:14:08.808 --> 01:14:10.368
"Little"?

01:14:10.403 --> 01:14:12.205
There's nothing
"little" about you.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.075
Uh, how is this possible?

01:14:14.110 --> 01:14:16.913
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

01:14:17.751 --> 01:14:19.883
Sentinel is a liar.

01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:21.918
What?
Huh?

01:14:21.953 --> 01:14:24.085
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.594
I was never
the most focused miner.

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:30.058
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

01:14:30.093 --> 01:14:31.961
[mechanical whirring]

01:14:37.903 --> 01:14:42.136
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.271
My friends,

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:49.374
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

01:14:50.410 --> 01:14:53.587
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

01:14:53.622 --> 01:14:56.986
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

01:14:57.021 --> 01:14:59.153
He stole our freedom.

01:15:02.961 --> 01:15:08.800
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

01:15:08.835 --> 01:15:12.936
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:17.468
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

01:15:18.009 --> 01:15:20.141
Right now.

01:15:20.176 --> 01:15:23.518
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

01:15:25.852 --> 01:15:29.788
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

01:15:29.823 --> 01:15:32.758
but the spark
that resides in their core.

01:15:32.793 --> 01:15:36.927
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

01:15:36.962 --> 01:15:40.799
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

01:15:40.834 --> 01:15:43.197
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

01:15:43.232 --> 01:15:46.970
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

01:15:47.005 --> 01:15:49.038
We are not alone in this.

01:15:49.073 --> 01:15:51.843
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

01:15:51.878 --> 01:15:53.504
we will have to
fight for it.

01:15:53.539 --> 01:15:56.881
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

01:15:56.916 --> 01:15:58.883
[supportive chatter]
...for ourselves.

01:15:58.918 --> 01:16:00.313
[scattered cheers]

01:16:01.217 --> 01:16:03.151
Stand up for this injustice.

01:16:03.186 --> 01:16:05.351
[cheers growing]

01:16:05.386 --> 01:16:09.058
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

01:16:09.995 --> 01:16:11.731
Follow me.

01:16:11.766 --> 01:16:14.635
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:18.166
[cheering, chanting]
Together as one.

01:16:18.201 --> 01:16:22.676
[all chanting]
Orion Pax! Orion Pax! Orion Pax!

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:25.173
[Orion]<i> Elita, it's time.</i>

01:16:25.208 --> 01:16:26.504
You got it.

01:16:26.539 --> 01:16:28.781
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

01:16:35.449 --> 01:16:38.483
[groaning, gasping]

01:16:38.518 --> 01:16:41.255
[determined groans]

01:16:42.192 --> 01:16:43.422
Not a good idea.

01:16:45.591 --> 01:16:47.767
[whispering]
D, stay down.
[groans]

01:16:59.572 --> 01:17:01.407
Well, that's a shame.
[mechanical whirs]

01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:03.376
You really were
a great miner.

01:17:07.888 --> 01:17:10.317
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

01:17:11.122 --> 01:17:11.989
[grunts]

01:17:19.559 --> 01:17:22.131
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

01:17:23.068 --> 01:17:24.771
High Guard, eject.

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:26.740
Come on! Move out!

01:17:27.303 --> 01:17:28.467
[laserfire pulsing]

01:17:41.614 --> 01:17:43.757
[alarm blaring]
There's too many.
We have to abort!

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:47.288
[yelps]
[alarm intensifying]

01:17:49.391 --> 01:17:50.456
We're not gonna make it.

01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:52.491
[all yelling]

01:17:53.329 --> 01:17:54.295
Whoo-hoo!

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:55.901
Metal to the pedal, miners!

01:17:55.936 --> 01:17:57.661
Let's break some protocol!

01:17:57.696 --> 01:17:59.432
[Elita] That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

01:18:05.077 --> 01:18:06.670
[growling]

01:18:06.705 --> 01:18:08.980
[grunting]

01:18:09.015 --> 01:18:11.345
Whoa! That's intense.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:16.053
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.957
That's right, you do.

01:18:18.992 --> 01:18:21.696
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:36.337
[alarmed chatter]
What's going on?

01:18:39.144 --> 01:18:40.506
[electronic charge]

01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:41.716
[Orion] Hey!

01:18:47.185 --> 01:18:48.987
What has he done to you?

01:18:49.022 --> 01:18:51.858
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

01:18:52.795 --> 01:18:55.059
[Orion] Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

01:18:55.094 --> 01:18:57.655
[electronic throbbing]

01:18:59.725 --> 01:19:02.066
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

01:19:02.101 --> 01:19:03.837
I'm doing this my way.
D!

01:19:09.372 --> 01:19:10.404
Yes!

01:19:10.439 --> 01:19:11.471
Whoa!
[metal clangs]

01:19:11.506 --> 01:19:13.011
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:19:13.046 --> 01:19:14.375
I got a battle mask!

01:19:14.949 --> 01:19:16.113
[grunts]

01:19:16.148 --> 01:19:18.049
Elita! Battle mask!

01:19:18.084 --> 01:19:21.019
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

01:19:21.054 --> 01:19:23.054
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:27.124
What the--?

01:19:28.292 --> 01:19:30.127
[laughs triumphantly]

01:19:30.162 --> 01:19:31.931
[deep voice] Badassatron.

01:19:37.235 --> 01:19:39.136
Where's Sentinel?
[both grunt]

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:43.943
[Sentinel]
You pathetic little twits.

01:19:43.978 --> 01:19:48.277
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

01:19:48.312 --> 01:19:52.116
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
[Sentinel] What truth?

01:19:52.151 --> 01:19:54.822
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

01:19:54.857 --> 01:19:57.022
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

01:19:57.057 --> 01:19:58.386
and live like a king?

01:19:58.421 --> 01:20:01.389
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

01:20:01.424 --> 01:20:05.393
[mechanical whirring]
...is what I make it.

01:20:07.595 --> 01:20:08.495
Incoming!

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:11.663
Whoa!

01:20:12.402 --> 01:20:14.270
[laserfire pulses]

01:20:15.438 --> 01:20:17.075
He's too strong.
I have a plan.

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:19.275
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:21.541
We need her memory.
Where is she?

01:20:21.576 --> 01:20:23.147
Found her! [yells]

01:20:24.678 --> 01:20:25.644
Elita!

01:20:26.515 --> 01:20:27.921
<i> Do not break her.</i>

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.252
<i> Bring her</i>
<i> to the broadcast station.</i>

01:20:29.287 --> 01:20:30.484
<i> We'll meet you there.</i>

01:20:30.519 --> 01:20:32.453
[strained]
Easier said than done.

[Orion]<i> I said,</i>
<i> don't break her!</i>

01:20:52.805 --> 01:20:55.806
Relax! I'm being very gentle.

01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.989
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

01:21:03.024 --> 01:21:04.584
I can see that.

01:21:04.619 --> 01:21:06.784
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

01:21:06.819 --> 01:21:08.654
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.032
[B-127] Yeah!

01:21:18.039 --> 01:21:19.170

[roars]

01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:34.548
Uh, excuse me.
You can't be in here.

01:21:41.821 --> 01:21:43.491
B!

01:21:43.526 --> 01:21:46.329
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

01:21:46.364 --> 01:21:48.969
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:50.597
It was already like that.
Right?

01:21:50.632 --> 01:21:51.939
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

01:21:51.974 --> 01:21:54.040
Yeah, it was already like--
Yes. Mm-hmm.

I have to do this!

No, you don't.

Can't you see that?

Don't be like Sentinel.

01:26:58.841 --> 01:27:03.074
Follow me and you will
never again be deceived.

01:27:03.879 --> 01:27:06.418
Rise up!

01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:08.486
[crowd chanting]
Rise up! Rise up!

01:27:08.521 --> 01:27:11.687
Rise up! Rise up!
Rise up!

01:27:11.722 --> 01:27:14.052
[Alpha Trion]<i> Orion Pax,</i>

01:27:14.087 --> 01:27:17.187
<i> your noble sacrifice</i>
<i> for the greater good</i>

01:27:17.222 --> 01:27:21.235
<i> has proven you worthy</i>
<i> in the eyes of Primus.</i>

01:27:22.029 --> 01:27:24.502
<i> He entrusts in you</i>

01:27:24.537 --> 01:27:27.406
the future of Cybertron

01:27:27.441 --> 01:27:33.038
and the Matrix of Leadership!

01:27:33.073 --> 01:27:34.237
[crowd clamoring]

01:27:34.272 --> 01:27:37.647
I will lead us all
into the future!

01:27:41.785 --> 01:27:44.258
[electrical crackling]

01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:55.731
I...

01:27:56.503 --> 01:27:57.568
am...

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.274
Megatron!

01:28:00.969 --> 01:28:02.903
[Alpha Trion]<i> Arise...</i>

01:28:03.609 --> 01:28:06.038
<i> Optimus Prime.</i>

01:28:09.010 --> 01:28:10.911
Burn it down!

01:28:11.584 --> 01:28:12.913
All of it!

01:28:18.316 --> 01:28:21.493
All hail Megatron!

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:25.893
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

01:28:27.402 --> 01:28:29.094
Stop! It's over.

01:28:29.129 --> 01:28:32.867
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:34.506
[grunts]

01:29:06.331 --> 01:29:07.803
Impossible.

01:29:10.478 --> 01:29:14.337
Primus gave you the Matrix.

01:29:14.372 --> 01:29:16.548
We could've built
the future together.

01:29:16.583 --> 01:29:18.583
I'll build it myself.

01:29:18.618 --> 01:29:22.180
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

01:29:23.557 --> 01:29:25.018
[roars]

01:29:40.068 --> 01:29:40.935
[pained grunt]

01:29:42.367 --> 01:29:43.542
[roars]

01:30:00.726 --> 01:30:01.923
[electronic charging]

01:30:03.762 --> 01:30:04.794
Ah!

01:30:06.864 --> 01:30:08.061
[growling]

01:30:09.834 --> 01:30:11.768
[both grunting]

01:30:13.035 --> 01:30:14.936
[powering up]

01:30:48.433 --> 01:30:49.905
[roars]

01:31:00.984 --> 01:31:03.754
[panting heavily]

01:31:06.924 --> 01:31:10.123
We were given the power
to change our world

01:31:10.158 --> 01:31:12.631
and you chose to destroy it.

01:31:12.666 --> 01:31:14.094
Just like Sentinel.

01:31:14.129 --> 01:31:17.966
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.432
And you betrayed me.

01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:34.587
Go.

01:31:35.447 --> 01:31:38.118
Take the High Guard
and leave.

01:31:39.352 --> 01:31:42.958
You are banished from Iacon.

01:31:47.833 --> 01:31:50.163
It didn't have to end
this way.

01:31:52.497 --> 01:31:55.971
This isn't over, Prime.

01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:05.882
High Guard, follow me!

01:32:19.491 --> 01:32:22.030
[Optimus Prime]<i> The line</i>
<i> between friend and enemy</i>

01:32:22.065 --> 01:32:25.198
<i> is not as clear</i>
<i> as I once believed.</i>

01:32:25.233 --> 01:32:29.136
<i> Once it's crossed,</i>
<i> there's no going back.</i>

01:32:29.171 --> 01:32:33.173
<i>Because some transformations</i>
<i>are permanent.</i>

01:32:33.208 --> 01:32:35.043
[Orion] Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

01:32:35.078 --> 01:32:37.210
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

01:32:37.245 --> 01:32:39.047
[both] The greatest Prime
to ever live.

01:32:39.082 --> 01:32:40.785
[both laugh]

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:43.546
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

01:32:43.581 --> 01:32:45.955
You ever mine Energon before?

01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:47.352
No. You?

01:32:47.387 --> 01:32:49.563
No. I hear it's dangerous.

01:32:50.258 --> 01:32:51.664
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:54.194
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:55.393
All right.

01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:58.231
Thanks, Pax.

01:33:11.279 --> 01:33:13.576
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

01:33:13.611 --> 01:33:15.688
And a new leader.

01:33:15.723 --> 01:33:17.690
Yes, about that.

01:33:17.725 --> 01:33:22.695
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

01:33:22.730 --> 01:33:24.664
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

01:33:24.699 --> 01:33:27.062
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

01:33:27.097 --> 01:33:30.065
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:32.837
How's Major Elita sound?

01:33:32.872 --> 01:33:35.400
How about Commander?

01:33:35.435 --> 01:33:37.369
[chuckles] Even better.

01:33:37.404 --> 01:33:41.340
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

01:33:41.375 --> 01:33:43.177
I may be a Prime now,

01:33:43.212 --> 01:33:44.915
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:48.413
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

01:33:48.448 --> 01:33:50.613
I get to work
for the government.

01:33:50.648 --> 01:33:54.254
[shimmering tone]
Okay. So that's new.

01:33:54.289 --> 01:33:55.926
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

01:34:07.368 --> 01:34:09.401
[all cheering]

01:34:26.354 --> 01:34:30.092
[Optimus Prime]
<i> And now we stand here</i>

01:34:32.492 --> 01:34:35.625

<i> to become</i>

01:34:38.905 --> 01:34:43.567
<i> to right wrongs,</i>
<i> to make our world better.</i>

01:34:43.602 --> 01:34:46.746
<i> Because here,</i>
<i> freedom and autonomy</i>

01:34:46.781 --> 01:34:49.474
<i> are the rights</i>
<i> of all sentient beings.</i>

01:34:50.576 --> 01:34:55.051
<i> Here,</i>

01:34:56.516 --> 01:35:00.122

01:35:00.157 --> 01:35:05.523
<i>If you dare</i>

01:35:05.558 --> 01:35:08.460
<i> I will be waiting.</i>

01:35:08.495 --> 01:35:12.299

01:35:40.197 --> 01:35:42.659
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

01:35:42.694 --> 01:35:44.936
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

01:35:44.971 --> 01:35:46.872
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:50.436
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

01:35:50.471 --> 01:35:52.273
Watch this. Knife hands!

01:35:54.178 --> 01:35:55.210
No!

[Megatron]

<i> A stronger enemy.</i>

<i> A personal enemy.</i>

01:43:33.164 --> 01:43:37.342
