00:39.340 --> 00:40.670
Listen up.[soldiers] Sir.

00:40.870 --> 00:42.890
We're going after
Dr. Baxter Stockman.

00:43.090 --> 00:45.550
He was TCRI's
lead genetic scientist,

00:45.750 --> 00:46.990
but he went rogue,

00:47.190 --> 00:48.990
stole billions of dollars'
worth of research

00:49.190 --> 00:52.860
and created an actual mutant.

00:53.060 --> 00:56.260
He's holed up
in a makeshift lab
of an abandoned building.

00:56.460 --> 00:57.650
Each of you has been issued

00:57.850 --> 00:59.820
a high-powered
antimutant neutralizer.

01:00.020 --> 01:03.090
Whatever Stockman's made,
this can unmake it.

01:03.290 --> 01:06.050
Cynthia Utrom herself
will be quarterbacking from HQ.

01:06.250 --> 01:07.830
Anything to add, Cynthia?

01:08.030 --> 01:12.400
<i>This mission </i>
<i>is of the utmost importance.</i>

01:12.600 --> 01:16.410
<i>Failure will be frowned upon.</i>

01:16.610 --> 01:19.450
<i>Bring me Stockman's mutant</i>

01:19.650 --> 01:22.500
<i>and whatever he used</i>
<i>to make it.</i>

01:22.700 --> 01:24.200

02:02.830 --> 02:05.670
My friends at TCRI...

02:05.870 --> 02:08.020

...want to use you as a weapon.

02:08.220 --> 02:10.200
I couldn't allow that.

02:10.400 --> 02:12.200
[normal voice]
But we're safe now.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.470
Soon I'll make you
brothers and sisters.

02:15.670 --> 02:18.220
A real family for both of us.

02:19.310 --> 02:21.860
I never had a family,
little one.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.430
Nobody liked me.

02:23.630 --> 02:25.080
I always felt
a greater connection

02:25.280 --> 02:27.910
to the animals
I experimented on
than people.

02:28.110 --> 02:30.230
With you and your siblings...[chittering]

02:30.970 --> 02:32.920

for tonight.

05:25.810 --> 05:27.180
The target
is across the street.

05:27.380 --> 05:29.220
We must use stealth

...and a party-size bag

about the party size.
He underlined it twice.

05:49.620 --> 05:51.070

you're on toiletries.Got it.

25:01.410 --> 25:02.370
[both scream]Uh-oh.

25:03.410 --> 25:04.980
Eat that, no crumbs!

25:06.800 --> 25:08.240
[engine revs]

25:12.070 --> 25:13.380
[Donatello]
Okay, chill out!

25:16.770 --> 25:18.600
Mikey, watch out!

25:19.730 --> 25:21.780
[screaming]

25:23.690 --> 25:25.690
He's Tokyo drifting
around us.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.080
I'm awesome.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.260
[Donatello] Aw, nice![Leonardo] Yeah, Raph!

25:38.460 --> 25:41.390
[breathes heavily, groans]

25:41.590 --> 25:43.360
Guys, look around!

25:46.100 --> 25:47.830
[cheering]

25:48.030 --> 25:50.720
We did it!We did that!
I totally helped.

25:51.810 --> 25:53.880
[Donatello]
Hide, hide, hide.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.710
[grunts]

25:55.910 --> 25:59.930
Hello,
I'm an unarmed noncombatant
here for her scooter.

26:00.130 --> 26:01.120
Whoa.

26:01.950 --> 26:03.340
Y'all got your butts
whupped.

26:08.300 --> 26:11.380
This is really not
how I thought this night
was gonna go.

26:11.580 --> 26:12.420
[clattering]

26:12.620 --> 26:14.420
Wait.
Where'd you guys go?

26:14.620 --> 26:15.700
Hey.

26:17.570 --> 26:19.430
Hey, I see you in there.

26:19.630 --> 26:20.740
I think she can see us.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.610
[Donatello] She can't.She totally can!

26:22.810 --> 26:24.570
[teenager]
I won't make a big deal
about the ninja star.

26:24.770 --> 26:27.350
You got my scooter back so I
feel like that's square. Um...

26:27.550 --> 26:29.920
Donnie, you go out first.
You're the most inviting
and friendly.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.310
[turtles chattering]I get that you have to huddle,

26:32.510 --> 26:35.050
but the longer you lurk
in the shadows,

26:35.250 --> 26:37.060
like, the more sus it gets
every second.

26:37.260 --> 26:39.970
She said we're sus!
That's not good.[teenager] You know? Yeah.

26:40.170 --> 26:43.670
And now it's, like,
doubly sus to be whispering
about how sus...

26:43.870 --> 26:45.060
[gasps]

26:45.260 --> 26:46.330
Hey.Wassup?

26:46.530 --> 26:47.890
Hey.

26:48.090 --> 26:51.070
Oh, you're crime-fighters
with turtle costumes.

26:51.270 --> 26:55.160
Yeah, I'm gonna be honest.
I don't think all
the good animals are taken.

26:55.360 --> 26:58.250
Sharks. Uh, there's
wolves up for grabs.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.560
Wow, the costumes
are really crazy.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.780
These eyes are wet
like real eyeballs.

27:02.980 --> 27:04.390
How do you get this
on and off?

27:04.590 --> 27:07.910
That's your skin!She touched--
That's my skin.

27:08.110 --> 27:10.360
What are you?
What could you be?

27:11.970 --> 27:14.060
Can we explain this
over some pizza?

27:17.410 --> 27:19.100
How you guys feel
about pepperoni?

27:19.300 --> 27:21.240
She's down for pizza?I didn't think it
would get this far.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.320
So, there's this rat...Long ago,
in New York City...

27:25.520 --> 27:28.240
...my brothers and I......we were
a bunch of turtles...

27:28.440 --> 27:31.020
[turtles talking over
each other]

27:31.220 --> 27:34.980
This is-- I don't know
where we came from....our dad again--

27:35.180 --> 27:37.680
Stop. Stop. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

27:37.880 --> 27:41.160
Okay, you were
real baby turtles

27:41.360 --> 27:44.560
who made contact
with mystery ooze,

27:44.760 --> 27:48.390
and therefore started to age

27:48.590 --> 27:53.570
from mutant baby turtles
to mutant-turtle-men-guys?

27:53.770 --> 27:55.440
Uh, turtle boys, actually.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.440
I would say teens.
I would say cool teens.Yeah, we're cool.

27:58.640 --> 28:02.230
Teenagers! Amazing. Insane.
All right, well, tell me more.

28:02.430 --> 28:05.140
Obviously, I want to know
everything about you.

28:05.340 --> 28:08.450
Like, is there more of you?

28:08.650 --> 28:09.890
Nope, just us.

28:10.090 --> 28:11.930
"They are alone
in the world."

28:12.130 --> 28:14.590
And nobody's ever
asked you about this

28:14.790 --> 28:16.370
or talked to you about this?

28:16.570 --> 28:18.290
I know, right?No, not really.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.420
Sometimes we pretend to be on
<i>Wendy Williams,</i> but that's it.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.070
Why you writing
all this down?

28:22.270 --> 28:24.770
Oh. I'm a journalist.
Well, I want to be a journalist.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.160
I write for my school paper.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.470
Really?

28:27.670 --> 28:29.390
I assumed you'd want
to be on camera,

28:29.590 --> 28:32.040
'cause you have
a very camera-ready look.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.350
Nope. No. [chuckles]
Never on camera.Okay.

28:35.550 --> 28:39.180
I'm down here researching
this story on Superfly
and his string of super crimes.

28:39.380 --> 28:43.230
The police have been talking
about implementing this curfew
if they don't find him soon.

28:43.430 --> 28:45.270
It spooked the parents,
and they canceled prom.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.320
I'm trying to help
bring him to justice

28:47.520 --> 28:49.750
so everyone can chill out
or whatever.

28:49.950 --> 28:52.970
But this!
Turtle mutant karate teens.

28:53.170 --> 28:55.320
I mean,
this is a pretty good story.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.590
Look, I don't know
if we should.

28:57.790 --> 29:01.590
Why not? This is gold!
This is so good!

29:01.790 --> 29:03.680
We were taught that humans
would try to destroy us

29:03.880 --> 29:05.420
if they ever found out
we ever existed.

29:05.620 --> 29:07.860
You know, kill us,
or put us in a lab and milk us.

29:08.060 --> 29:10.770
I wouldn't milk you.
You don't even have nipples.

29:10.970 --> 29:12.910
Look, human woman,
I got a question.

29:13.110 --> 29:15.390
So just be straight with me.

29:15.590 --> 29:18.130
Do you think there are
more people like you?

29:18.330 --> 29:20.870
You know, people
who will accept us?

29:21.070 --> 29:23.060
[inspirational music playing]

29:24.890 --> 29:26.270
[music stops]No. No, absolutely not.

29:26.470 --> 29:28.660
Um, genuinely, no.
There's no way.

29:28.860 --> 29:31.320
I knew it!It's confirmed.
We're doomed.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.400
Wait, wait, wait.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.800
If I'm being honest...

29:35.000 --> 29:38.540
I mean, the reason I'm not
scared of you is, you know,
you guys helped me out.

29:38.740 --> 29:40.060
And if you hadn't,

29:40.260 --> 29:42.890
and I had just, like,
stumbled across you,

29:43.090 --> 29:44.850
yeah, I'd be very scared.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.030
I'd be really, um,
freaked out and disgusted.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.640
[cell phone buzzes]Sorry, my mom is texting.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.990
[dings]Dad is texting us!
He's freaking out a bit.

29:53.190 --> 29:55.430
Well, at least
all parents are the same.

29:55.630 --> 29:57.780
A hundred percent.Yeah, for sure.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.320
Our dad is definitely not
a giant rat.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.310
That makes me feel
like he's a rat.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.520
Well, I'll AirDrop you
my contact,

30:05.720 --> 30:07.310
and if you ever feel like

30:07.510 --> 30:09.880
you want to come out
into the world or whatever,

30:10.080 --> 30:11.530
just let me know.

30:11.730 --> 30:14.100
I would love to write
a story about it, seriously.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.800
Good night.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.150
[door closes]

30:17.350 --> 30:18.410
She seemed cool.

30:18.610 --> 30:19.890
Here he goes again.Every girl, man.

30:20.090 --> 30:22.060
That's your type?Give me that contact.

30:22.260 --> 30:24.990
Give me that contact! Please.
Give me the phone!

30:26.690 --> 30:28.550
[Donatello] It was sick!

30:28.750 --> 30:31.330
I mean, you guys saw it.
I was, like, wow!

30:31.530 --> 30:33.380
I want more, guys.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.120
I got the taste of life,
and I don't want to
wash it out of my mouth.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.820
I want it to linger
on my tongue,
swish around my throat and--

30:39.020 --> 30:41.210
You're really driving
this metaphor into the ground.

30:41.410 --> 30:44.000
But he's right.
I mean, it was too good
to give up on.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.220
You guys heard April
and the words that came out

30:46.420 --> 30:48.830
of her incredibly formed
and beautiful mouth.

30:49.030 --> 30:52.660
The only reason she liked us
was because we saved her.
She saw us as heroes.

30:52.860 --> 30:56.050
So, what if everyone
saw us as heroes?[Michelangelo] What do you mean?

30:56.250 --> 30:57.890
I mean, look!

30:59.810 --> 31:02.760
We use our ninja skills
to take out Superfly.

31:02.960 --> 31:04.580
<i>We'll drag him up to City Hall,</i>

31:04.780 --> 31:07.150
<i>dump him on the steps</i>
<i>for the cops and say,</i>

31:07.350 --> 31:09.500
<i>"We're the heroes</i>
<i>who stopped Superfly!</i>

31:09.700 --> 31:12.070
<i>Yeah, we look</i>
<i>a little different,</i>
<i>but we're on your side."</i>

31:12.270 --> 31:13.590
<i>Everyone will be like,</i>

31:13.790 --> 31:15.510
<i>"Hey, those 'âtoitles'</i>
<i>are all right.</i>

31:15.710 --> 31:17.290
<i>I'm a cabbie from the Bronx."</i>

31:17.490 --> 31:19.380
<i>Then everyone in the city</i>
<i>will think we're cool.</i>

31:19.580 --> 31:21.380
<i>They'll accept us.</i>

31:21.580 --> 31:23.600
[as fan]  <i>"Sign my baby!"</i>

31:23.800 --> 31:26.130
[Donatello]  <i>And then,</i>
<i>once the overall fanfare</i>
<i>has settled down,</i>

31:26.330 --> 31:29.130
<i>we'll enroll in high school, </i>
<i>where we'll be normal--</i>

31:29.330 --> 31:32.570
<i>if not slightly more popular </i>
<i>than average-- students.</i>

31:32.770 --> 31:34.440
Okay,
I'm following this.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.220
It's like Hulk
in  <i>Avengers: Endgame.</i>

31:36.420 --> 31:38.530
Sure, he's a giant,
terrifying green monster,

31:38.730 --> 31:40.230
but everyone knows
he saved them,

31:40.430 --> 31:42.670
so they're taking selfies
with him in a diner.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.930
You know Mark Ruffalo
mostly improvised that scene?

31:45.130 --> 31:48.020
I know.
He's good on his feet.Nobody cares about that, okay?

31:48.220 --> 31:49.670
This is a great plan.

31:49.870 --> 31:51.590
If this works,
I won't have to hang
with you losers

31:51.790 --> 31:52.850
for the rest of my life.

31:53.050 --> 31:54.500
Yeah.Yeah! That's very true.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.330
Uh, what about Dad,
though?

31:56.530 --> 31:59.480
I mean, he doesn't really
need to know about it.

32:00.220 --> 32:01.350
Right?

32:02.740 --> 32:05.250
Look, if we're gonna do this,
we'll have to get April's help.

32:05.450 --> 32:07.950
Sounds like she's been doing
tons of research on Superfly.

32:08.150 --> 32:09.470
She probably has
some good leads.

32:09.670 --> 32:13.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

32:13.680 --> 32:15.610
So you're in?Yeah, I'm in.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.000
[all cheer]

32:17.200 --> 32:20.360
[Donatello] Let's go!
We did it, Mikey!

32:20.560 --> 32:21.970
[phone ringing]

32:22.170 --> 32:23.920
Hello? Turtle-- Fellas.

32:24.120 --> 32:26.100
Uh, hey.
Is that you guys for real?

32:26.300 --> 32:27.540
[Leonardo]  <i>Hi...</i> [chuckles]

32:27.740 --> 32:29.710
...April. Yes, it's...
[voice cracks] ...Leo!

32:29.910 --> 32:31.800
You know, we were talking... <i>Yeah?</i>

32:32.000 --> 32:33.670
...and we have a proposal. <i>Okay.</i>

32:33.870 --> 32:35.500
You help us find Superfly,

32:35.700 --> 32:37.890
we bring him to justice,
you document it all,

32:38.090 --> 32:41.380
and when we got him,
you release the story,
your prom is uncanceled,

32:41.580 --> 32:43.380
and we get accepted
by the world as heroes.

32:43.580 --> 32:45.250
<i>Wow. Yes. Uh, yeah.</i>

32:45.450 --> 32:47.430
Okay. [clears throat]
Sure. I mean... [chuckles]

32:47.630 --> 32:48.820
...if I'm being honest,

32:49.020 --> 32:50.950
I totally stopped
thinking about this.

32:51.150 --> 32:53.260
I had a lot of things to do.

32:53.460 --> 32:55.650
By the way,
do you guys have ears?

32:55.850 --> 32:58.740
Just say yes,
just say yes.I think so?

32:58.940 --> 33:00.920
They think they have ears.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.570
Okay, perfect. Yes.

33:02.770 --> 33:05.230
<i>Um, how about we meet tonight, </i>
<i>8:00 p.m., Eastman High.</i>

33:05.430 --> 33:08.710
<i>Everyone will be gone, </i>
<i>and I've got all my research </i>
<i>in the school darkroom.</i>

33:08.910 --> 33:11.670
Cool. Cool.
So, uh, it's a date.

33:11.870 --> 33:13.280
Wait, what?

33:13.480 --> 33:15.930
No, no, just hang up.
Just hang up.

33:16.130 --> 33:17.800
You know what?
[imitating static]

33:18.000 --> 33:20.730
It's like bad service
or something.
I'll see you tonight!

33:21.820 --> 33:23.260
Who's got no rizz now?

33:24.690 --> 33:26.290
Sorry, Dad.
Have to leave now.

33:26.490 --> 33:29.480
Heading out!
Love you so much. Love you.Goodbye. Kisses!

33:30.350 --> 33:32.040
What are they up to?

33:32.240 --> 33:33.730
["Dance" playing]

33:33.930 --> 33:36.230
[all cheering, laughing]

33:50.070 --> 33:51.230
[Michelangelo] Whoo-hoo!

33:51.430 --> 33:52.970
Hey![April] Hey.

33:53.170 --> 33:56.230
You actually made it.
That seemed very dangerous.

33:56.430 --> 33:58.060
Oh, that?
Ha! Not at all.

33:58.260 --> 33:59.930
I mean, we eat danger
for breakfast.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.330
Actually, I eat pizza
with bits of waffles on it.

34:02.530 --> 34:03.760
It's better than it sounds.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.110
It actually sounds
delicious, honestly.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.770
Okay, well,
uh, come on in.

34:08.970 --> 34:11.640
Really? We can
just go in there?

34:11.840 --> 34:13.600
Yeah, of course.

34:13.800 --> 34:16.610
Welcome to Eastman High.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.430
[Raphael whistles][Donatello] Wow.

34:19.630 --> 34:21.080
[song continues]

34:21.280 --> 34:22.690
[electricity buzzing]

34:22.890 --> 34:23.650
[flies buzzing]

34:23.850 --> 34:25.390
It's very strange.

34:25.590 --> 34:27.920
I feel you guys
actually want to
go to high school.

34:28.120 --> 34:30.490
Yeah, we do.
We very much do.

34:30.690 --> 34:32.150
Why? Don't you
love high school?

34:32.890 --> 34:34.180
Oh, yeah, I mean,

34:34.380 --> 34:36.400
as a very popular
and well-liked person,

34:36.600 --> 34:37.970
I love high school,
yeah.

34:38.170 --> 34:39.620
But don't worry about me.

34:39.820 --> 34:42.320
Is this living up
to your dreams?

34:42.520 --> 34:43.540
No.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.500
It's even better!

34:47.880 --> 34:49.160
I don't even
know this person,

34:49.360 --> 34:51.070

than anyone ever has!

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Improv team tryouts!

34:55.670 --> 34:57.640
I've got to sign up.
This is amazing!

34:57.840 --> 34:59.600
Mikey, what are you--
We don't even go here.Yet.

34:59.800 --> 35:01.080
The tryouts aren't
for two weeks.

35:01.280 --> 35:02.390
We could be enrolled by then.

35:02.590 --> 35:04.560
They need a last name.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.260
Wait, what's our last name?

35:06.460 --> 35:08.310
I've never thought
about that, actually.

35:08.510 --> 35:10.920
Do we not have last names?Who are we?

35:11.120 --> 35:13.310
It's okay.
I'll just break it up.

35:13.510 --> 35:15.790
Michael Angelo.

35:15.990 --> 35:18.050
[in Italian accent]
Hey, I'm Michael Angelo.

35:18.250 --> 35:19.140
Perfecto.

35:19.340 --> 35:20.880
That makes you Leo Nardo!

35:21.080 --> 35:23.450
Nardo![turtles laughing]

35:23.650 --> 35:24.840
Hey, Nardo.Nardo.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.320
It could be Leon Ardo.
That's a cool name.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.720
Guys, lay off Nardo.[song ends]

35:28.920 --> 35:30.760
He's sensitive.[laughing]

35:30.960 --> 35:32.680
She called him Nardo too.Nardo!

35:32.880 --> 35:34.070
Nardo!

35:34.270 --> 35:36.250
Hey, well, at least
I'm not "Puke Girl."

35:36.450 --> 35:38.070
That is a bad nickname!

35:38.270 --> 35:39.990
We don't know
if that says "Puke Girl."

35:40.190 --> 35:42.770
It could be "Poke Girl."
Maybe this girl just likes tuna.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.730
Oh, my God.
Are you Puke Girl?

35:44.930 --> 35:47.390
She's Puke Girl!That does not say "poke."

35:47.590 --> 35:50.170
All right! Stop.
Listen. [groans]

35:50.370 --> 35:52.180

ever since I was young,

35:52.380 --> 35:53.920
I wanted to be a journalist,
and so,

35:54.120 --> 35:56.480
I thought I could read
the morning announcements,

35:56.680 --> 35:58.230
and, you know, well,

35:58.430 --> 36:00.360

to find Superfly

36:43.730 --> 36:45.100
and get prom uncanceled,

36:45.300 --> 36:47.360
I can remain firmly
off camera,

36:47.560 --> 36:50.970

something cool instead of--

36:51.170 --> 36:52.410

You don't want that anymore?
No?

Okay, listen.

Superfly seems to be
building something.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.700
I mean, we're talking
Gru/Megamind-type stuff.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.180
He's knocking off insanely
highly technical shipments.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.140
State of the art.
Incredibly expensive.

37:28.340 --> 37:30.140
And he pays off thugs
to do his dirty work

37:30.340 --> 37:32.490
so he can stay
completely under the radar.

37:32.690 --> 37:34.360
Nobody's ever seen his face.Why?

37:34.560 --> 37:37.020
Because he kills
everyone who does.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.460
Whoa!Cool.

37:39.660 --> 37:40.850
No, not cool.

gonna find him?

37:43.790 --> 37:45.720

37:45.920 --> 37:47.770
They stole
a radioactive storage unit.

37:47.970 --> 37:51.640

I found this at the chop shop
where they took my scooter.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.080
They must be doing business
with Superfly.

Short Sharon, Bald Bronson,
Toupee Tom and Normal Nate.

can lead us to Superfly.

I mean, this is crazy-like.

45:59.980 --> 46:00.870
Let me guess.

46:01.070 --> 46:02.660
Fifteen years ago, right,

46:02.850 --> 46:04.570
some sludge
was dumped in a sewer,

46:04.770 --> 46:05.960
and y'all came from that.

46:06.160 --> 46:07.570
We prefer the term "ooze,"
but yeah.

46:07.770 --> 46:09.620
It's like more--
It's just nicer sounding.

46:09.820 --> 46:11.400
It rolls off
the tongue better.

46:11.600 --> 46:12.880
[turtles] Ooze, ooze...

46:13.080 --> 46:15.450
It's nice, right?
It's ooze.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.060
Damn! Ooze.

46:17.260 --> 46:19.410
I like that.
I like "ooze."

46:19.610 --> 46:23.240
So, look, that same ooze
made me, okay?

46:23.440 --> 46:25.070
My dad, Baxter Stockman,

46:25.270 --> 46:28.160
he's the one
who dumped the ooze
down the drain, baby.

46:28.360 --> 46:30.330

where you came from

What do I want? Oh, easy.

Acceptance.

No way, man!
We want that too.Yeah, like us.

49:07.300 --> 49:09.070

49:10.290 --> 49:13.110
<i>My earliest memory in the world</i>

49:13.310 --> 49:17.850
<i>is my dad telling me</i>
<i>that he never was accepted.</i>

49:18.050 --> 49:22.030
<i>He just wanted a family, man. </i>
<i>That's why he created us.</i>

49:22.230 --> 49:25.120
<i>But then, that's when</i>
<i>the people he worked for</i>

49:25.320 --> 49:26.210
<i>sent the ops through.</i>

49:26.410 --> 49:27.830
<i>They took it from him.</i>

<i>I rescued my little</i>

<i>We're very well-adjusted.</i>

<i>but maybe they just</i>
<i>ain't all bad, you know?</i>

49:50.290 --> 49:51.800
<i>We went out. We hit the town.</i>

<i>And it didn't go well.</i>

49:54.040 --> 49:54.930

<i>Especially this one dude.</i>

<i>He wouldn't stop chasing us. </i>
<i>He wanted to kill us!</i>

50:02.530 --> 50:04.330
Oh, my God.
That's what happened to us.

50:04.530 --> 50:07.070
That's why our dad
made us live in the sewer
our whole lives.

50:07.270 --> 50:09.860
Not me. That sounds
like a punk choice.

50:10.060 --> 50:12.860
You know what I did?
I beat that fool down!

50:13.060 --> 50:15.690

mollywhopped him.

Whop, whop to
a inch of his life. Bop!

50:18.330 --> 50:20.040
And then I knew what to do.

50:20.240 --> 50:23.440
I decided
to kill all the humans

50:23.640 --> 50:25.570
and let the mutants
rule the Earth.

50:25.770 --> 50:27.400
That-- That's a take.

50:27.600 --> 50:31.750
I inherited my dad's mind
for science and I thought,

50:31.950 --> 50:35.840
"What if I built a machine
to enact my plan?"

50:36.040 --> 50:38.760
I've been stealing
all the parts that I need,

50:38.960 --> 50:41.150
and now I'm ready.

50:41.350 --> 50:44.110
I'm gonna use
a little of my blood

50:44.310 --> 50:47.850
to create
a weaponized version
of the ooze.

50:48.050 --> 50:50.990
Then we gonna launch it
into the atmosphere

50:51.190 --> 50:54.600
and watch it vaporize.
[buzzes]

50:54.800 --> 50:55.730
Here's the kicker:

50:55.930 --> 50:57.340
Every animal on Earth

50:57.540 --> 50:59.560
will be transformed
into a mutant.

50:59.760 --> 51:03.560
Every fly, flea, tick,
snake, fish and whale.[people screaming]

51:03.760 --> 51:05.040
Everything!

51:05.240 --> 51:08.000
And we become
the dominant species on Earth.

51:08.200 --> 51:12.020
That's bad.
That's very bad... for me.

51:13.500 --> 51:15.880
What happens to humans
in this plan of yours?

51:16.080 --> 51:17.620
[chuckles] Nothing good.

51:17.820 --> 51:19.930
We wish
there was another way
to feel safe and happy,

but peoples,
they got to go!

gonna be eaten, enslaved,

a form of entertainment...

...you know what I mean?

51:30.660 --> 51:32.200

to have dog shows

51:32.400 --> 51:33.810
and they had horse races?

51:34.010 --> 51:38.080
Maybe we'll have redhead shows,
fat booty boy races.

51:38.280 --> 51:39.910
Baby tossing.
Something like that.

51:40.100 --> 51:41.170

speaking, obviously.

We'd need a long and narrow

to press the pedal.

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:16.330
Does that say
"milking machine"?

01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:17.680
No, no, no.[overlapping chatter]

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:19.590
It's the opposite of that.

01:05:19.790 --> 01:05:21.070
It's a milking machine.

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.600
See? I told you! They milk you!

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.250
Now I actually might puke.

01:05:24.450 --> 01:05:27.120
Boys, you left the sewer
and got milked.

01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:30.170
You helped some evil fly man
create a machine

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:32.080
that is gonna destroy
the world

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.870
and kill
the only good human, April!

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:37.350
So, we're going
to clean up your mess,

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:40.660
then go home
and stay there forever, okay?

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:42.440
What about April's story?

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:43.920
Forget the story!

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.330

It's over, okay?

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:55.380
Let's go.

01:06:00.170 --> 01:06:02.290

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.200
Nah, it's all right.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.470
Seeing you guys
make so many mistakes

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.600
just to get people to like you
made me realize

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:12.490
I was definitely doing this
for the wrong reason.

01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.270
[sighs]

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:24.760

Sealing off the entrance.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.240
Maybe they decided
to just give up

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:46.720
and go bowling again?

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.860
[Superfly] Nah, fam, nah.

01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.700

01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:01.560
I don't want to fight

Y'all just won't quit, huh?

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.700
What is it about
these stinking humans

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:08.480
that you love so much?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.840
Humans are
complicated creatures.

01:07:11.030 --> 01:07:12.970
They're good, like April,

01:07:13.170 --> 01:07:14.930
and bad, like that lady
who milked us.

01:07:15.130 --> 01:07:16.100
Sorry, did what now?

01:07:16.300 --> 01:07:18.360
As much
as I don't like them--

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.670
and trust me,
I do not like them--

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:23.800
if we kill them, we are
no better than they are.

You're not killers.
I mean, come on, look at you.

But it's the only way
we'll be accepted.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.600
No!We accept you.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.430
You could come live with us.
We accept you.

01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:44.170
Yes, plenty of room.

01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.390
I kind of don't want
to murder everyone on Earth.

And really,
I don't think we ever did.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.740
We just didn't know there was
any other alternative.

01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.000
But now that
we met these dudes,

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.650
we see that there is.

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:32.090

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:18.440
And the world will love you
and accept you!

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:22.220
And the world will chant,
"Turtles, Turtles, Turtles!"
[pants]

01:14:22.420 --> 01:14:23.660
Oh, man.

01:14:23.860 --> 01:14:25.790
I am feeling great
after that speech, right?

01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.270
It was rousing.
I'm fully roused.

01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:30.360
But a little bit
of a buzzkill here:

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.710
[both] How do we do that?[cell phone buzzes]

01:14:32.910 --> 01:14:34.840
Hello?[April]  <i>Hey.</i>
<i>What am I looking at?</i>

01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:37.980
What happened to
the whole "stop Superfly" thing?

01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.720
Are we not doing that,
or what's up?

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.110
So much has changed
since we last spoke.

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:43.330
[April]  <i>Yeah, obviously.</i>

01:14:43.530 --> 01:14:44.900
It's a lot
to catch up on, okay?

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:46.860
But first,
do you maybe know any ways

01:14:47.060 --> 01:14:48.510
we might be able
to stop that thing?

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:49.950
[grunts]

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:53.990
Well, I actually might
have something.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.600
Meet me
at the leg of the thing
we're all looking at.

01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:57.560
Right? Cool.

01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.660
[engine rumbling, revs]

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:05.870
Let's go![cheering]

01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:08.020
["Ante Up" playing]

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.980
[laughs]

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.190
[Bebop]
We're dangling, baby!

01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:22.590
Yep, this is
not triumphant at all.

01:15:22.790 --> 01:15:23.810
[Scumbug garbles]

01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.070
Agh, it hit my lip!

01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:26.870
[song continues]

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.440
New York, New York![song ends]

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:46.480
I'm here, baby!

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.480
Y'all thought it was
gonna be Godzilla?

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.220
Nah![exhales sharply]

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:54.010
Okay, let's go.
Eye of the tiger.
You got this, Raph.

01:15:54.210 --> 01:15:55.620
Close one eye.
I heard that helps.

01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:56.710
Shut up.

01:15:56.910 --> 01:15:58.620
[all chattering]

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.380
Don't screw this up.

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:08.890
[whinnies]

01:16:09.090 --> 01:16:10.980
What the hell?

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:12.850
[Donatello]
We did it. We actually did it.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:13.940
I think I got it.

01:16:14.140 --> 01:16:15.470
[shouts, gurgles]

01:16:15.670 --> 01:16:17.090
We're good, right?

01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:20.120
[horse whinnies]

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.950
That's it? One little horse?
I don't need that horse.

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:24.910
You're clearly not
shooting him.

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:27.040
It looks like
y'all want to die now.

01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:29.280
[crowd clamoring]

01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:37.230

01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:38.790
[high-pitched ringing]

01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:40.580
[Wingnut, muffled]
This isn't going good.

01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.710
What did the claw say
to the face?

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:44.070
"Smack!"[Wingnut shrieks]

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:46.980
Rocksteady! Buddy!

01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:48.280
[ringing continues]

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.640
Mondo!

01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:52.200
[exclaims]

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.640
It's okay.
It grows back. See?

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:59.130
[Donatello, echoes]
Mikey! Mikey!

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:01.440
[Michelangelo] Donnie!

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.520
Thanks, bro.

01:17:04.710 --> 01:17:05.910
Where are the others?I don't know!

01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:08.310
[stammering]
Where's Dad? Where's April?

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.520
[shouts]

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:13.150
He's gonna run out
of cars eventually.

01:17:15.230 --> 01:17:16.050
Oh, come on!

01:17:16.250 --> 01:17:17.400
[turtles breathing heavily]

01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.670
You like these rides
right here? [grunts]

01:17:20.670 --> 01:17:21.880
Oh, the Mercedes E Class,
no!

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.580
[Raphael]
That one's a Prius. It's okay.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:25.460
[exclaims] A Tesla!
Somebody's mad about that.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:28.290
[all panting]

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.030
I think we lost him.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.250
[turtles screaming]

01:17:39.870 --> 01:17:41.740

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:44.210
[exclaims]

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.700
Hit that from the back.

[turtles groaning, coughing]

01:17:49.670 --> 01:17:51.010

[gasps] It's them!

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:31.340
I don't think
this is gonna go down
how we wanted it to.

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.650
They... hate us.

01:18:33.850 --> 01:18:37.100
They think we're villains.No. Worse.

We're never gonna be normal.

01:18:42.810 --> 01:18:44.020
Look, guys,

01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:45.920
April was right.

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.230
We were doing this
for the wrong reasons.

01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:49.970
I know we only wanted
to be heroes

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:51.750
to be accepted.

01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:54.890
But even though it looks like
we'll never be accepted,

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.060
I still think
we should try to be heroes.

01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:58.240
But how?

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.800
Every plan we've had
has failed.

Plan? You're complaining
we don't have a plan?

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.900
Mikey, what do you do
better than anyone,
even Mark Ruffalo?

01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:07.290
Improvise.

01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:08.770
It's impossible.

Says the guy
who has read more comics

01:19:10.930 --> 01:19:13.380
where people are
fighting giant monsters
than anyone on Earth!

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.600
I have, but--You must be able
to think of a way

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.100
to stop something like that.

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.220
Of course!  <i>Attack on Titan!</i>

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.350
Giant monsters attack,
and they have one weakness--

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:26.830
on the backs of their necks.

01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:30.150
Yes, and the blowhole
is exactly that.

01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:32.580
That's it.

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.620
If we can get this thing
into that thing's blowhole,

01:19:34.820 --> 01:19:36.360
it'll go into its bloodstream.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.890
I bet it'll demutanize it.

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:40.320
There you go!
Demutanize the big monster!

01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:41.980
And, Raph,

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:43.720
it's time to go loud.Loud?

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.890

As loud as you've ever gone.

to help us.

like a leader.I do?

01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:07.090
Oh, I do! I sound
like such a leader!

01:20:07.290 --> 01:20:09.130
Holy crap,
that's so dope!And you ruined it.

Okay, not great.
Not great at all.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:31.590
Very bad.

If you're just joining us,

01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:34.330
an army of mutants

that appears to be led
by four turtle men

01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:39.690

A fly monster is
attacking the city,

but the turtle teens,

01:21:02.910 --> 01:21:05.100
along with the rat, warthog,
stingray, crocodile,

bat, frog, lizard
and cockroach lady

01:21:07.310 --> 01:21:09.800
are in fact fighting
against the monster

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.890
in an attempt to save New York.

01:21:12.090 --> 01:21:13.370
The giant monster is bad,

01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:15.500
but the mutants you see here
are in fact good!

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:18.120
[retches, gasping]

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:20.380
Sorry. I really thought
I got past that.

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:21.860
That's a thing from my past.

01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:23.660
Anyway, as I was saying...

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:28.750
[all] Whoa!

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.490
[both speaking Vermin]

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:46.880
Whoa, Dad, you speak
the same language as Scumbug?

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.150
We actually have
a lot in common.

01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:50.890
I'm really attracted to her.

01:21:51.090 --> 01:21:52.280
Oh, that's gross.

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.110
Donnie, you should
not be driving.

01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:57.430
Sorry, Dad.But since you are,
go there!

01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:02.960

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:51.820
That's it!
You are done. It's over.

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:53.780
You ain't never
gonna stop me.[screaming, groaning]

01:22:53.980 --> 01:22:59.090
And humans
are never gonna like you
because humans suck!

01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:00.570
These shells are hard.

01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:03.020
[cracking]I'ma snap you
like a pistachio.

01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.050
This sucks!I know I said your faces
were the last things

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:09.140
I wanted to see before I die,

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.360
but now that
we're actually about to die,

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.410
there's nothing
I'd rather be looking at.

01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:14.670
That was so heartfelt.

Gone without a trace.
