WEBVTT

03:10.974 --> 03:12.392
Keep dreamin', brother!

03:35.082 --> 03:36.208
Are you free?

03:36.249 --> 03:39.628
Mylord's offer is tempting,
alas, my heart is taken...

03:41.296 --> 03:42.756
But maybe I can amend that?

03:43.298 --> 03:45.425
Aaah... mylord is
targetting my feelings!

03:46.218 --> 03:47.344
Who must I kill, at this rate?

03:47.678 --> 03:50.598
Nobody, but I must get to the airport.
You think it's possible in 20 minutes?

03:50.889 --> 03:53.809
20 minutes? Leaves me enough time
to finish my sandwich... get on board!

03:59.857 --> 04:02.651
It's a perfect opportunity to test out
some new settings...

04:02.693 --> 04:03.611
let me know what you think!

04:36.560 --> 04:38.353
Do you mind if I put some music on?

04:38.395 --> 04:40.188
No... but get moving!

04:43.025 --> 04:44.276
And there we go...!

04:57.956 --> 05:00.458
Mylord is lucky, the streets of
Marseille are empty in winter...

05:00.501 --> 05:02.210
it's more practical for sightseeing!

05:02.252 --> 05:03.546
Yeah, lucky me...

05:11.303 --> 05:13.681
But all this visiting is
gonna make us late...

05:13.722 --> 05:16.600
fasten your seatbelt please,
I'm gonna have to switch to 3rd gear...

05:16.642 --> 05:17.643
No problem!

05:40.457 --> 05:41.499
You got some change?

05:41.750 --> 05:42.876
Well, no...

05:42.918 --> 05:43.711
Me neither...!

05:47.297 --> 05:49.508
Wasn't that Daniel?

05:49.592 --> 05:51.218
Who else 'd you think?
The Air Force?

05:51.259 --> 05:54.972
Looks like he's in good shape!
The cops won't catch him anytime soon!

05:55.013 --> 05:59.142
I wouldn't be so sure...
Apparently, the cops have a new weapon!

05:59.184 --> 06:02.270
A new weapon? What kind of weapon?

06:02.312 --> 06:04.147
A secret one.

06:04.189 --> 06:06.859
"State Police"

06:12.072 --> 06:13.323
This is boring...

06:20.748 --> 06:22.916
Oh shit! 298 km/h!

06:22.958 --> 06:26.879
Attention!
White cab driving at 298 km/h...

06:26.920 --> 06:29.006
l repeat: 298 km/h!

06:29.047 --> 06:30.633
Roger, we're on it!

06:43.478 --> 06:46.273
l was worried there,
l thought they were asleep!

06:46.314 --> 06:47.482
But that's a cop car!

06:47.525 --> 06:49.109
Oh no, just some old pals...

06:49.151 --> 06:51.278
They're very playful, you know!

06:52.112 --> 06:53.405
Bertrand, get his number
as soon as we're close enough!

06:53.446 --> 06:54.197
Don't worry...

06:59.953 --> 07:00.829
"Go Marseille!"

07:00.871 --> 07:03.666
Hey that's not a plate number!
It's an email!

07:11.674 --> 07:13.258
Ok, game's over.
Hang on!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.266
Hey, why are you stopping?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.185
Are you kidding?
I'm pedal to the metal!

07:25.270 --> 07:26.104
Is that nitro?

07:26.146 --> 07:28.440
Oh no, a friend of mine has a bar...

07:28.607 --> 07:30.275
it's made with Pastis.

07:30.609 --> 07:33.361
If you want, I can give you the address...

07:33.403 --> 07:34.738
You're very kind!

07:50.045 --> 07:53.173
Hold on a second... is that a TGV?

07:53.215 --> 07:54.633
Yeah, it's a good machine...

07:54.717 --> 07:59.054
it's fast in the curves...
but kinda slow in a straight line!

08:00.514 --> 08:01.765
Mamma mia!

08:07.521 --> 08:08.564
Where do I drop you off?

08:08.606 --> 08:10.315
Here!
Right here.

08:12.985 --> 08:14.695
19 minutes 32 seconds!

08:17.781 --> 08:20.618
I'm impressed!
No customer ever managed that...

08:20.659 --> 08:23.662
usually whenever I stop, hop!
...straight in the bag!

08:23.996 --> 08:24.788
Thanks!

08:30.168 --> 08:31.587
You're sure it's the right place?

08:31.712 --> 08:33.005
Absolutely.

08:38.176 --> 08:40.345
Oh, I see...

08:42.014 --> 08:44.307
Well thank you for your cooperation...

08:47.144 --> 08:50.105
Tell me, don't I know you from somewhere...?

08:50.188 --> 08:52.858
If I'd ever met you, I'd remember that!

08:53.692 --> 08:54.860
Bon voyage!

09:00.783 --> 09:02.242
Emilien's never gonna believe me!

10:59.985 --> 11:03.113
Subtitles by Smarties

11:08.536 --> 11:09.870
What's wrong?

11:10.579 --> 11:14.875
Nothing. l had a nightmare.
Go back to sleep, darling.

11:39.858 --> 11:41.068
What the hell are you doing?

11:41.109 --> 11:43.654
Nothing! It's only been 8 months
that I can't sleep!

11:44.321 --> 11:45.447
Because of that gang?

11:45.698 --> 11:50.202
They've been bugging us for 8 months.
8 months! I can't get them off my mind!

11:50.243 --> 11:54.206
I noticed that! I've been trying
to tell you something for 8 months!

11:54.247 --> 11:57.167
I know, I know... We just can't
get them, no matter how we try!

11:57.209 --> 11:58.627
Did you hear what I said?

11:58.669 --> 11:59.294
Of course!

11:59.336 --> 12:01.547
And I'm glad you mention it,
because 37 hold ups in 8 months...

12:01.589 --> 12:03.256
all dressed up as Santa Claus,
can you imagine that?

12:03.340 --> 12:05.467
And you don't believe in
Santa anymore, right?

12:05.509 --> 12:07.385
I do! I mean, no,
it's not the problem...

12:07.427 --> 12:10.180
Now winter's here and I worry about the
Christmas present they may be preparing!

12:10.222 --> 12:12.725
Speaking of which, I already know
what I'm getting you for Christmas...

12:14.226 --> 12:18.689
Thanks Petra but you can't help me.
I must catch that gang by Christmas!

12:18.856 --> 12:21.900
And me Émilien, l need to talk
to you BEFORE Christmas!

12:22.442 --> 12:23.902
Ok, that's a deal.

12:25.195 --> 12:26.196
What are you doing?

12:26.572 --> 12:27.740
l'm going to the office.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.366
But it's 3 AM!

12:29.449 --> 12:36.331
What? Oh yeah... That's ok.
l'll avoid rush hour traffic.

12:36.373 --> 12:37.833
There won't be any traffic for sure!

12:37.875 --> 12:38.709
Good!

12:43.756 --> 12:45.173
See you in the office?

13:30.260 --> 13:32.095
Hello, I'd like to
make an appointment!

13:32.763 --> 13:34.640
Oh - Lily, honey!
You up already!

13:34.682 --> 13:37.350
Yes! I'm awake at 4 AM,
because my man is fixing his car!

13:37.392 --> 13:39.853
But it ain't broken!
lt's winter time.

13:40.062 --> 13:43.356
l am just making some modifications
to make it more stable in the cold...

13:44.357 --> 13:47.528
Listen, could you also install a heater
in my bed when you got time?

13:47.611 --> 13:50.864
It would make me a bit more stable
too, since I'm ALONE in a cold bed!

13:50.906 --> 13:53.576
Except that it's not just in
winter time but all year round!

13:53.617 --> 13:54.618
Don't say that, Lily...

13:54.660 --> 13:58.997
Don't touch me! It'll take me forever
to remove the stains with a scrungie!

13:59.331 --> 14:00.874
Uh... what's a scrungie?

14:00.916 --> 14:05.879
A scrungie is used to clean out jugs,
pans and stupid pots - like me!

14:05.921 --> 14:07.881
Don't say that! Let me wash my hands,
I'll be with you in a minute.

14:07.923 --> 14:10.676
Oh no no no dear sir,
that's not how it works!

14:10.801 --> 14:14.638
You wash your hands, then wait an hour
for that "white spirit" stench to vanish

14:14.680 --> 14:16.932
and by then, usually
it's time to go to work!

14:18.016 --> 14:19.602
Gee you're really up and running today!

14:19.643 --> 14:22.605
Look, I woke up two hours ago,
watched you in your sleep for 30 min,

14:22.646 --> 14:25.273
and since I couldn't sleep,
I decided to do something useful

14:25.315 --> 14:27.150
instead of just watching TV!

14:27.442 --> 14:29.236
Daniel! We don't HAVE a TV!

14:30.487 --> 14:32.155
Never mind, it's the
principle that counts!

14:32.197 --> 14:33.824
There's no TV, no stereo

14:33.866 --> 14:37.160
no curtains, no couch, not a single
vase to put some flowers in...

14:37.494 --> 14:39.246
assuming you'd ever offer me flowers...

14:39.371 --> 14:43.208
But we DO have a fridge. It's filled
with motor oil, but we have a fridge!

14:43.709 --> 14:44.209
Lily...

14:44.251 --> 14:46.128
We also have a shower
that smells of gas...

14:46.169 --> 14:48.213
a washer, specially designed
to wash car covers...

14:48.255 --> 14:50.924
a wardrobe, in which
my dresses must fight

14:50.966 --> 14:52.843
for room with host of tires...
- Lily!

14:52.926 --> 14:59.558
And finally, a glorious symbol of our
luxurious life, we also own... a garage!

14:59.600 --> 15:01.309
Hey what's wrong with you?
You're getting your period?

15:01.351 --> 15:03.228
No I'm not, that's the whole point!

15:03.854 --> 15:06.023
l just can't live anymore in a garage!

15:06.064 --> 15:07.816
l am a women.
Do you remember what that is?

15:07.941 --> 15:10.318
A woman is not just a smile
and a peachy soft skin.

15:10.736 --> 15:15.824
A women moves, thinks, evolves, and
sometimes would like some comfort!

15:18.493 --> 15:21.204
Oh dear... all this just because
I like to tinker with my car!

15:21.246 --> 15:22.497
That's women for you...!

15:28.295 --> 15:30.506
What's all that fuss about,
white spirit smells good!

15:38.889 --> 15:40.140
Lily, what are you doing?

15:41.559 --> 15:42.935
I'm going back to live with my parents.

15:43.018 --> 15:44.728
What, you're trading a garage
for an army barracks?

15:44.770 --> 15:47.856
Barracks with curtains, a small
garden and flowers on the table!

15:47.898 --> 15:49.858
Lily, this is ridiculous.
You can't leave me like that!

15:49.900 --> 15:51.694
You thought it was funny to
live in here with me!

15:51.735 --> 15:54.738
Yes, but it's not funny anymore and
I've been trying to tell you for months!

15:54.780 --> 15:57.032
First of all you don't live with ME,
you live with your CAR!

15:57.074 --> 15:58.491
This garage is too small
for both of us!

15:59.743 --> 16:01.494
It's your car or me. Good bye!

16:49.627 --> 16:52.838
Hi there, girls!
Getting the puppies some fresh air?

16:54.548 --> 16:57.968
Hey, take it easy!
What's a little joke between friends...

16:59.553 --> 17:01.346
Well then... Merry Christmas!

17:08.646 --> 17:10.689
But...? What are you doing...?

17:12.566 --> 17:14.442
Did you sleep in here?

17:14.527 --> 17:16.069
No, l was just dozing for five minutes...

17:17.069 --> 17:20.949
Must've been 5 long minutes then,
the folder is stamped on your face!

17:21.659 --> 17:23.367
See, it's the same with trees...

17:23.410 --> 17:25.453
You know, tree stumps?
One circle equals one year?

17:25.494 --> 17:28.791
Well see, I can tell you've
been sleeping for...

17:30.793 --> 17:31.794
...20 years.

17:36.339 --> 17:38.592
Oh, forget it.
Just forget what I said, ok?

17:39.259 --> 17:41.554
Apparently nobody likes jokes
anymore around here...

17:41.720 --> 17:44.014
To think that I signed up because
I thought we'd have some fun...

17:44.056 --> 17:46.099
Stop it or I'm gonna split
your side... with an axe!

17:46.224 --> 17:49.227
Hey guys! I just got some fresh
weed here, want some?

17:49.853 --> 17:53.774
Oh, no, no...
NO! No no no...!

17:53.816 --> 17:55.693
Don't be stupid guys, it's high quality!
Straight from Jamaica!

17:55.734 --> 18:01.657
Gosh really, from Jamaic...?
... no! Who'd you think we are?

18:01.824 --> 18:04.242
OK then - your loss.
Bye!

18:04.451 --> 18:04.952
Bye...

18:05.703 --> 18:06.328
Tell me...

18:06.662 --> 18:08.205
Hey!
What about some coke?

18:09.456 --> 18:10.082
Rashid...!

18:10.165 --> 18:11.542
Well then, good day to you...

18:13.085 --> 18:14.670
What's that supposed to mean?

18:16.254 --> 18:18.006
And what are all these posters on the wall?

18:18.090 --> 18:19.216
Uh... Bob Marley?

18:19.299 --> 18:21.009
Damnit, this is a police
station, not a squat!

18:21.051 --> 18:24.680
Are you aware that we've been trying
to catch a gang for the past 8 months?

18:25.514 --> 18:26.348
The Santa Claus gang?

18:26.389 --> 18:27.683
Yes, the Santa Claus gang!

18:28.225 --> 18:30.310
Glad you remembered
the name, at least!

18:31.353 --> 18:34.064
37 robberies in 8 months,
and no clue, nothing!

18:34.982 --> 18:37.192
I've searched everywhere...
and nothing, nothing at all.

18:38.694 --> 18:41.279
I feel useless.
A loser.

18:44.742 --> 18:49.079
How about if I... if I ask
Rashid for a little, uh, tonic?

18:49.121 --> 18:50.330
No.

18:50.623 --> 18:52.290
I'm just trying to help here...

18:54.376 --> 18:56.795
How about a little breakfast then?

18:58.672 --> 19:00.966
Just to get some energy back?

19:03.135 --> 19:04.512
OK, let's go have breakfast.

19:21.486 --> 19:24.239
Guess you were a little hungry, eh?

19:24.281 --> 19:26.700
I haven't eaten for days, out of
worrying over this case!

19:27.242 --> 19:28.368
l have these terrible nightmares.

19:28.410 --> 19:30.788
I'm strapped to a chair and a dozen
Santas dance around me...

19:30.829 --> 19:31.830
It's horrible!

19:31.872 --> 19:33.999
Stop it. Stop it, it's horrible!

19:34.542 --> 19:35.793
Your shoe's untied.

19:36.794 --> 19:40.756
Plus it'll be Christmas soon,
they'll be able to hide much better!

19:40.798 --> 19:43.175
That's right! It was easier in July!

19:43.216 --> 19:45.093
Yeah but we didn't catch 'em then...

19:45.135 --> 19:47.470
And now Christmas is coming,
and I know they're up to something.

19:47.513 --> 19:49.347
Something big, to finish
the year with a bang.

19:49.557 --> 19:54.770
There's one thing that's puzzling me:
why do they dress up as Santa Claus?

19:54.853 --> 19:56.564
Nobody would suspect a Santa!
Look over there...

19:58.148 --> 20:01.860
Santa is nice, he gives presents,
looks dorky in his big red outfit...

20:03.779 --> 20:04.863
It's usually too big...

20:09.284 --> 20:10.536
Or too small...

20:14.331 --> 20:15.833
It's a perfect disguise...

20:17.375 --> 20:18.961
to hide...

20:21.379 --> 20:22.422
a gun!

20:36.144 --> 20:39.189
I can see that you are interested
in our new food processor

20:39.272 --> 20:40.858
it can chop, slice and grind!

20:41.483 --> 20:42.943
Do you have kids?

20:59.835 --> 21:02.546
You there, freeze!
Police!

21:07.425 --> 21:09.512
Don't move!
You are under arrest!

21:11.847 --> 21:12.890
What happened?

21:12.931 --> 21:15.893
I got one, Alain!
It took me 8 months, but I got one!

21:16.226 --> 21:19.229
But how did you know he was a fake,
I mean, a member of the gang?

21:19.271 --> 21:21.732
Have you ever seen a Santa
carry a peacemaker?

21:21.774 --> 21:23.275
A gun! How'd you know?

21:23.316 --> 21:24.735
This dork dropped it!

21:24.777 --> 21:25.694
What a dork!

21:25.819 --> 21:27.029
Yep, dorky for sure.

21:27.070 --> 21:27.613
You're a dork!

21:27.821 --> 21:29.615
The inspector's gonna like this!
Let's go!

21:29.865 --> 21:34.202
Hello boss! Look what I got here!
Shit, where is he when you need him?

21:34.244 --> 21:36.539
You, put your ass down
there and don't move, ok?

21:38.456 --> 21:41.877
Well, until the Chief gets here,
let's just pretend I'm the Chief, ok?

21:42.753 --> 21:44.171
I think that desk fits me, what d'you think?

21:44.755 --> 21:45.839
Hey, you're sure about this?

21:45.881 --> 21:47.925
Bof, he's gone anyway...
And after this catch,

21:47.966 --> 21:50.093
I'm sure we won't remain simple
inspectors much longer, trust me!

21:50.302 --> 21:53.806
Ok Santa, in the meantime you're gonna
tell us how you got a cop's gun...

21:53.847 --> 21:55.098
Who did you steal it from?

21:57.184 --> 21:59.061
Alain, I think that Santa
is looking for an address...

22:00.312 --> 22:01.354
The Marseille region?

22:08.236 --> 22:11.532
Whenever you forget something,
my colleague will use the directory.

22:11.574 --> 22:12.324
You got that?

22:12.365 --> 22:15.452
Now about this gun... you know,
there is a registration number here...

22:15.493 --> 22:17.287
All we have to do is
search the database,

22:17.329 --> 22:18.872
and in a few seconds we'll know

22:18.914 --> 22:20.999
which idiot got his weapon mugged!

22:24.628 --> 22:27.422
What a dork!
He stole Gibert's gun!

22:29.424 --> 22:31.594
- lmpossible!
- l swear. Take a look!

22:31.927 --> 22:34.179
Did you know that you stole this
from our favorite commissioner?

22:34.847 --> 22:37.015
Can you explain how
you pulled that off?

22:37.850 --> 22:38.601
Alain...

22:38.809 --> 22:41.604
Maybe it would be easier
if we removed the sticky tape...?

22:42.855 --> 22:44.523
You're right.
That might help.

22:50.362 --> 22:51.363
Émilien?

22:53.156 --> 22:55.158
Co... commissioner!

22:57.661 --> 22:58.912
I'm needed out there...

23:01.915 --> 23:03.959
But why are you dressed up
like that, Commissioner?

23:04.001 --> 23:08.005
l am doing my job, Émilien. I tried
to infiltrate the Santa Claus gang...

23:08.046 --> 23:10.382
but you had to screw up
everything, as usual!

23:11.008 --> 23:12.968
I'm... I'm sorry, Chief, but...!

23:13.636 --> 23:15.804
Why didn't you inform us,
we would all have joined you!

23:15.846 --> 23:17.890
It's not an invasion,
It's an infiltration...

23:17.931 --> 23:19.975
Precise, meticulous
and SOLITARY!

23:20.058 --> 23:23.395
But don't worry Émilien, I'll get
a tailored costume for you.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.857
It includes a cap and a whistle,
so you can infiltrate every crossroad!

23:27.941 --> 23:29.985
And now would you please
unfasten me, so I can kill you?

23:30.027 --> 23:31.194
Of course, Chief.

23:31.319 --> 23:33.906
Shit...
Alain took the key with him!

23:33.947 --> 23:35.866
Hurry up Émilien,
I'm losing patience!

23:35.908 --> 23:36.867
5 minutes, Chief.

23:46.001 --> 23:47.503
Are you Commissioner Gibert?

23:48.754 --> 23:49.963
No, not yet...

23:50.005 --> 23:54.802
I mean, I'm not commissioner yet and
I'm not called Gibert... unfortunately.

23:54.968 --> 23:57.513
I mean, I sure wouldn't want
to be called Gibert, but...

23:57.555 --> 23:58.430
The key, Émilien...!

23:58.556 --> 23:59.515
Right away, Chief!

24:07.981 --> 24:09.817
Are you commissioner Gibert?

24:11.735 --> 24:14.988
Yes I am... wha wha...
wow... what can I help you?

24:16.031 --> 24:17.741
Good afternoon.
My name is Qiu.

24:17.991 --> 24:21.036
Qiu? Coo, how cute! I would queue
for your coo...chie.. uh?

24:21.078 --> 24:23.789
I mean, that's a really
cute name, "Qiu"...

24:24.582 --> 24:25.874
That name from China?

24:25.958 --> 24:29.962
Yes. My mother is chinese,
and my father... swiss.

24:30.045 --> 24:32.965
Aah, l know the place well...
Switzerland, that is.

24:33.549 --> 24:37.219
l am a journalist from
World lnternational.

24:37.302 --> 24:40.430
I am currently working on a big
report about the French police.

24:40.681 --> 24:45.310
l want to follow closely the work of a big
inspector, and l heard you are the biggest.

24:45.561 --> 24:50.899
Err, yeah that's right... 6' 4" and 220 lb,
that's pretty big for the police...

24:51.024 --> 24:53.110
How impressive.

24:53.151 --> 24:57.364
Oh? Yes, sure! When I look in the mirror
I often impress myself, me personally...

24:58.115 --> 25:01.326
May I get "embedded"
with you for a few days?

25:01.409 --> 25:03.411
As often and as long
as you want...!

25:03.453 --> 25:05.914
Err, l mean, as long as needed
to conduct your probe.

25:05.956 --> 25:09.042
I like to be in bed too when
I probe err... embedded...

25:09.459 --> 25:11.754
Thank you very much.
Do we start now?

25:12.254 --> 25:13.672
With pleasure...

25:20.888 --> 25:22.806
- Thank you, coochie...!
- You're welcome.

25:26.727 --> 25:30.230
What are you doing, dressed
up as Santa in your office?

25:30.272 --> 25:34.276
Eh? This!
This is a camouflage.

25:34.317 --> 25:38.321
We are trying to catch a gang, whose
members disguise as Santa Claus.

25:38.363 --> 25:42.159
So we have to merge with their universe
in order to penetrate them better...

25:42.284 --> 25:43.536
And the handcuffs?

25:43.661 --> 25:45.328
I have no idea, they're not mine!

25:46.371 --> 25:47.956
So, any further questions?

25:49.416 --> 25:50.543
Come in.

25:51.710 --> 25:52.419
Am I disturbing?

25:52.460 --> 25:54.713
Oh no, in my current state,
nothing can disturb me anymore...

25:55.255 --> 25:58.050
Well since you're alone in your
office and not doing any work,

25:58.091 --> 25:59.677
I'd like to talk with
you for 5 minutes.

25:59.718 --> 26:02.638
Petra, please, not now.
We'll discuss it at home tonight, ok?

26:02.680 --> 26:07.225
At home all think about is your work.
So I thought now that you're at work,

26:07.267 --> 26:08.686
...maybe we could discuss
something about our home!

26:08.727 --> 26:10.771
Not today Petra.
Just not today, ok?

26:10.813 --> 26:13.566
But you've been telling me
''not today'' for 8 months now!

26:13.607 --> 26:16.819
Listen, l am in shit creek up to my neck
so please don't push me down - not you!

26:18.236 --> 26:20.363
What is it this time?

26:20.656 --> 26:23.826
l caught a Santa.
With a gun, can you imagine?

26:23.867 --> 26:25.160
So of course, l thought
he was from the gang!

26:25.202 --> 26:27.871
You don't need to see a Santa
or a gun to think about it!

26:27.913 --> 26:29.122
You're ALWAYS thinking
about that gang!

26:29.164 --> 26:33.085
Yes, but this time there were both:
a Santa AND a gun, so I arrested him.

26:33.168 --> 26:34.753
You disarmed him by yourself?

26:35.128 --> 26:36.213
Well... yes?

26:36.254 --> 26:37.881
Guess he wasn't
from the gang, then.

26:38.298 --> 26:41.426
Unfortunately not...
lt was Gibert, dressed up as Santa.

26:42.302 --> 26:44.012
Sure, just laugh at me.

26:44.054 --> 26:48.058
It's the worst day of my life, and you
are laughing instead of cheering me up!

26:48.100 --> 26:49.351
You'd like me to cheer you up?

26:49.392 --> 26:53.188
Why, yes... you could say something nice,
some tender, loving words...

26:53.313 --> 26:57.150
for example, tell me some good news.
Just for ONCE today, some GOOD news!

26:57.192 --> 26:59.778
Émilien! l am pregnant.

27:00.403 --> 27:01.071
No!

27:01.113 --> 27:03.532
Yes!
How's that for good news?

27:03.616 --> 27:06.660
Well yes, of course...
But how long have you been...?

27:06.702 --> 27:08.120
For 8 months, Émilien!

27:08.621 --> 27:10.413
- No!
- Yes!

27:11.039 --> 27:13.208
Oh... but how did it happen?

27:13.250 --> 27:15.628
I met the Holy Ghost,
8 months ago...

27:15.669 --> 27:20.132
8 months? It can't be! I was there,
I would have seen, your belly...

27:20.298 --> 27:21.675
And your breasts...

27:22.801 --> 27:26.054
Aah... so that's why they became so...!

27:27.806 --> 27:30.017
And you... you're gonna keep it?

27:30.058 --> 27:32.227
It's a bit too late
to ask that question!

27:32.310 --> 27:34.146
Well yes, but...
why didn't you tell me?

27:34.187 --> 27:36.649
I've been trying to
tell you for 8 months!

27:36.690 --> 27:40.235
I've placed cauliflowers in every room!
There... and there!

27:40.944 --> 27:43.781
Oh... yeah, l was wondering
about all those veggies!

27:43.822 --> 27:47.951
And I hung up at least 20 echographies.
They are everywhere!

28:00.380 --> 28:01.298
ls it my baby?

28:01.339 --> 28:02.550
Well for now it's mine.

28:02.591 --> 28:04.927
lf you want a share of it,
you'll better wake up!

28:07.429 --> 28:08.556
ls the baby normal?

28:08.597 --> 28:11.600
Good question, when you
know the father...

28:11.642 --> 28:14.019
but yes, amazingly,
everything is normal!

28:14.144 --> 28:17.690
But then... if you're pregnant
and everything is normal...

28:17.731 --> 28:22.110
and you want to keep the baby...
That means I will be a daddy?

28:22.152 --> 28:27.533
Yes! What a display of brainpower!
You should consider joining the police.

28:27.575 --> 28:28.909
l am going to be a daddy?

28:29.034 --> 28:32.788
Yes. And this child will need
a super-daddy.

28:34.289 --> 28:38.293
Count on me Petra,
Count on me...!

28:39.211 --> 28:40.253
Lily!

28:51.306 --> 28:52.975
What a fool you are.

28:53.266 --> 28:57.062
What good is your big car now, if you
can't put the woman you love in it?

29:02.192 --> 29:03.235
Rapid test?

29:04.236 --> 29:05.988
Rapid test for what?

29:08.365 --> 29:10.784
Two bars...
What does that mean, two bars?

29:19.877 --> 29:20.503
Hello!

29:20.669 --> 29:20.961
Hello!

29:21.169 --> 29:22.838
Do you have the box
that comes with this?

29:23.338 --> 29:24.381
Let me see...

29:26.216 --> 29:29.595
"Clearblue rapid test".
Hey, isn't that a pregnancy test?

29:29.720 --> 29:31.889
Yes exactly, that's what
I'm anxious to find out!

29:31.930 --> 29:35.768
Aaah, I see... Let me fetch them,
they're right next to the condoms...

29:52.910 --> 29:54.327
Guess what, I'm out of them!

29:54.369 --> 29:58.248
They're in high demand these days.
Women love to make those presents...

29:58.290 --> 30:00.042
... a cute little baby for Christmas!

30:00.083 --> 30:02.252
See, I want to find out if
this is my Christmas present!

30:02.961 --> 30:06.381
Aaah, I see... Just a minute,
let me ask my daughter.

30:06.464 --> 30:07.465
Angel!

30:07.675 --> 30:11.595
She's studying pharmacy,
she knows all that stuff by heart.

30:11.637 --> 30:13.096
You'll see, it's really impressive!

30:13.221 --> 30:14.557
Angel, what's that?

30:16.433 --> 30:19.061
l am so sorry daddy!
I swear I tried to be careful!

30:19.436 --> 30:21.647
But I drank a little too much
and ran out of protections...

30:22.272 --> 30:25.358
But honey! There are condoms here,
I told you to just help yourself!

30:25.400 --> 30:26.860
Yes, but we don't
have his size!

30:27.528 --> 30:28.111
Who did that to you?

30:28.278 --> 30:29.154
I have no idea!

30:29.196 --> 30:31.031
What do you mean, "no idea"!
Doesn't that guy have a name?

30:31.114 --> 30:34.159
l told you, l was drunk!
I can't remember all their names!

30:34.827 --> 30:36.119
Oh my God...!

30:36.579 --> 30:38.747
Oh come on... merry Christmas!

30:39.790 --> 30:40.749
"Where is the police?"

30:40.833 --> 30:42.292
Gentlemen, this is serious.

30:42.501 --> 30:45.420
All the attempts we made to
arrest the Santa Claus gang

30:45.462 --> 30:48.298
including a personal commando
operation carried out by myself

30:48.507 --> 30:51.051
have failed, part of them because
of a over-zealous Émilien...

30:51.677 --> 30:55.514
But nevermind, this is the past!
The future is ours! And we'll do...

30:55.556 --> 30:58.976
what we decided yesterday
to do tomorrow, starting today!

30:59.059 --> 31:01.019
You should write that down.
That's a good one...

31:01.061 --> 31:03.564
Maybe a little twisted,
but I think it sounds good...

31:04.397 --> 31:05.398
Émilien, your shoe's untied.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.900
Yeah, it's just great...

31:07.317 --> 31:09.194
That's good...
Ok... now, where was I?

31:09.236 --> 31:10.028
At "this is serious", Chief!

31:10.195 --> 31:11.488
Yes it IS serious!

31:11.697 --> 31:17.119
And l won't accept any inopportune
mistakes or nauseous deviations!

31:17.202 --> 31:18.370
Don't write that.

31:18.579 --> 31:22.625
I want everything to be perfect,
smooth, "clean"! "Super-clean"!

31:23.584 --> 31:26.378
You see, last summer l attended
a training seminar with the FBI...

31:26.419 --> 31:29.422
so you see, some of the language
stuck... it's a reflex.

31:29.464 --> 31:30.465
Crazy, eh?

31:31.717 --> 31:32.551
... eh?...

31:33.343 --> 31:36.054
So now I am giving you the "go"...

31:37.931 --> 31:42.144
Not having caught the Santa gang
before Christmas is not an option!

31:43.979 --> 31:47.357
Of course this means no
vacations, sick leaves...

31:47.399 --> 31:48.817
Not even an excuse letter
from your parents!

31:49.652 --> 31:54.740
Especially since miss Piu... Qiu,
journalist of the... magazine

31:54.782 --> 31:56.742
Is giving us the honor of
following us on this mission.

31:56.784 --> 32:00.287
So I hope she will return to her country
with a good opinion of our police!

32:00.913 --> 32:02.998
The important words to
this mission are:

32:03.498 --> 32:06.960
Concentration, Reflection...
...Action!

32:07.753 --> 32:09.630
The codename for
this mission will be...

32:09.672 --> 32:13.842
Operation "Snow-white"

32:15.052 --> 32:16.970
Uh, that means
"Blanche-Neige" in French...

32:17.012 --> 32:18.639
And guess who'll
play the dwarves...

32:18.722 --> 32:20.265
Yeah... it's awesome...!

32:20.307 --> 32:23.936
So from now on, I want each
and every one of you on alert 24/7!

32:23.977 --> 32:25.521
So is this clear?

32:26.313 --> 32:26.939
Questions?

32:26.980 --> 32:27.523
Me!

32:27.565 --> 32:27.898
You?

32:27.940 --> 32:28.398
Yes!

32:28.440 --> 32:28.857
Oh?

32:28.899 --> 32:30.150
What's that gift
on your desk, Chief?

32:30.192 --> 32:30.734
A gift?

32:31.401 --> 32:33.862
Ooh! That's very kind.
Is that for my birthday?

32:33.946 --> 32:35.155
Uh, when were
you born, Chief?

32:35.238 --> 32:35.906
In July!

32:35.948 --> 32:36.824
Must be for Christmas, then.

32:36.865 --> 32:38.450
Whatever. It's the
intention that counts!

32:51.379 --> 32:53.256
Well there's something new...

32:53.882 --> 32:54.883
Very nice.
Who is it from?

32:54.925 --> 32:56.760
Must be someone
that knows you well!

32:58.136 --> 33:00.222
There's a little button on top...

33:00.556 --> 33:00.973
Yes...?

33:04.309 --> 33:05.561
Put the guns down!

33:06.353 --> 33:07.730
Aah, it's wonderful...

33:08.480 --> 33:12.275
Hey, you Pigs, this is Santa!
If you still believe in me, meet me

33:12.317 --> 33:16.404
at the European Bank for your gifts.
But hurry up, we leave at noon!

33:18.866 --> 33:20.242
Does anyone know
what time it is?

33:21.034 --> 33:22.620
IT'S 5 TO 12, CHIEF!

33:22.661 --> 33:27.666
RED ALEEERT!

33:30.335 --> 33:34.297
I said "discreetly"! How am I
supposed to work with such jerks!

33:34.422 --> 33:37.467
Those assholes... no no,
don't write this down, miss Qiu.

33:37.510 --> 33:40.095
It's just a temporary reaction,
typical French - we fight sometimes

33:40.137 --> 33:41.764
... however, we still mean it!

33:43.557 --> 33:48.604
Gibert here. Deploy and await my signal.
Let us initiate... uh... well, let's go!

33:49.062 --> 33:52.065
They will probably act like last time,
exit from the back in a fast car...

33:52.190 --> 33:54.109
All we have to do is wait.
We'll catch them by surprise.

33:54.192 --> 33:56.612
Chief... we won't surprise them
since THEY sent us the message?

33:56.654 --> 34:00.658
Look, they sent us a message to fool us,
being certain we'd take it for a joke...

34:00.699 --> 34:02.492
But that's counting without me,
Commissioner Gibert!

34:02.576 --> 34:04.662
Commissioner Gibert is
not falling for their trap!

34:04.703 --> 34:06.872
He is here, on time,
ready to attack!

34:06.955 --> 34:10.833
I understand, Chief, but what if the
trap consisted in attracting us here?

34:10.876 --> 34:14.004
Come on, think Émilien, think!
It doesn't make sense,

34:14.045 --> 34:17.716
why would a gang alert the cops when
they are about to commit a crime?

34:17.757 --> 34:19.176
I know, I know, that's
what's worrying me...

34:19.217 --> 34:21.011
They haven't been acting stupidly
during the last eight months...

34:21.053 --> 34:24.014
There's a first time for everything! And
particulary for stupidities, trust me!

34:24.056 --> 34:24.889
Unless...

34:25.891 --> 34:27.100
Unless what?

34:27.141 --> 34:28.811
Unless they are certain
they'll manage to escape?

34:28.851 --> 34:32.523
Hahaha... just let them try!
There's no escaping me, believe me!

34:33.649 --> 34:34.315
Chief!

34:34.357 --> 34:34.900
Yes?

34:45.034 --> 34:47.746
They will have to pass over us
if they want to leave that bank!

34:51.583 --> 34:53.376
What's that thing, there?

34:56.505 --> 34:58.381
lt's... it's a nightmare!

35:21.697 --> 35:22.781
Are you ok, Chief?

35:22.865 --> 35:26.619
I'm fine, I'm fine! What are you
waiting for to start the pursuit?

35:26.660 --> 35:28.203
How are we supposed to
stop a machine like that?

35:28.245 --> 35:31.456
How should I know?
Show some initiative, damnit!

35:32.082 --> 35:33.834
Alain, requisition a car!

35:38.463 --> 35:40.465
That guy's got some nerve!
Why didn't he stop his car?

35:40.508 --> 35:43.010
For a black cop in Marseille?
Fat chance!

35:43.051 --> 35:45.804
Well yeah, but still... he could've
slowed down, at least!

35:46.722 --> 35:50.100
It's OK! It's OK.
I'm used to it.

35:50.643 --> 35:52.561
Chief, maybe we should requisition
one of our own cars!

35:52.603 --> 35:55.105
Good thinking, Émilien.
GET IN THE CARS!

35:55.147 --> 35:58.441
Now this is our new security system.
It's unique worldwide!

35:58.692 --> 36:01.612
It's based on the "ATLAS"
system used by the police.

36:01.695 --> 36:05.699
All you have to do is push this button
and the cops will get here ASAP.

36:12.455 --> 36:13.666
It's really efficient!

36:25.844 --> 36:27.596
Oh shit oh shit!

36:41.902 --> 36:43.486
- Oh shit, my ride!
- Oh shit, my ride!

36:56.875 --> 36:59.127
Maybe I should get off here,
you would lose some weight!

36:59.169 --> 37:04.007
C'mon Émilien, your 50 lb won't make
a difference! And you, GO GO GO!

37:14.560 --> 37:16.645
So here we are in the famous
Marseille harbour...

37:16.729 --> 37:20.608
over there it's the "Cannelière",
taking it's name from cannabis...

37:20.649 --> 37:22.484
you know, to make ropes...

37:22.526 --> 37:25.821
it was built by King Louis XIV
in 1661 and... watch out!

37:26.572 --> 37:28.073
What the fuck...?
Are you keeping up, son?

37:28.115 --> 37:31.619
Certainly, sir! "...was built by
King Louis XIV in 1661"...

37:31.660 --> 37:34.162
You don't have to follow what
I'm SAYING, you moron!

37:34.204 --> 37:36.248
I'm talking about that big truck
with the big tires, there!

37:37.415 --> 37:38.083
Oh dear oh dear...

37:38.125 --> 37:41.211
See, my little coochie,
the problem is the staff!

37:41.253 --> 37:43.338
They don't pay any attention
during recruiting!

37:43.380 --> 37:46.299
For example this lad would make
an excellent swimming instructor,

37:46.341 --> 37:50.513
but now he's in a car chase without
even having a driver's license!

37:50.596 --> 37:52.723
Wha... what's that?
You don't have your license?

37:52.806 --> 37:54.474
Well no, I only joined
the police yesterday!

37:54.517 --> 37:55.601
I don't believe this!

37:55.643 --> 37:58.771
Calm down, Émilien. All he has to do
is follow that big truck over there...

37:58.812 --> 38:01.356
... piece of cake really, even a
swimming instructor could do it!

38:08.864 --> 38:09.573
What do I do now?

38:09.615 --> 38:11.491
You follow it, son,
just follow it!

38:15.037 --> 38:17.080
That truck must be drinking
a gallon of gas per mile!

38:17.122 --> 38:20.876
It'll run dry long before us!
I'd say in 5 or 10 minutes...

38:20.918 --> 38:22.920
That's supposing we're
still alive in 5 minutes!

38:22.961 --> 38:24.421
We will, we will...

38:56.494 --> 38:59.414
Maybe we should stop and
apologize to these people...

38:59.456 --> 39:02.334
There's a time for everything, Émilien.
Let's rush first, we'll apologize later...

39:02.375 --> 39:03.836
But we're rather
CRUSHING right now...!

39:03.877 --> 39:05.671
Stop your play on words,
Émilien! That's enough!

39:05.713 --> 39:06.505
Am I supposed to stop now?

39:06.547 --> 39:07.380
Huh? What for?

39:07.422 --> 39:08.006
There's a swimming pool!

39:08.048 --> 39:10.300
Yes, that might be a good...
STOP!

39:11.343 --> 39:13.846
Phew... that was
really close, eh?

39:15.263 --> 39:17.182
Hey! Watch it, there!

39:33.616 --> 39:35.367
I knew we wouldn't
last 5 minutes...

39:35.408 --> 39:38.871
See? That's some good insulation,
that is. Not a single leak!

39:39.079 --> 39:41.957
Um... is this standard
procedure with the police?

39:41.999 --> 39:44.502
Absolutely not! ln most of
cases, the cars leak...

39:46.629 --> 39:49.256
Chief... I... I can't swim!

39:49.297 --> 39:52.009
Oh, don't worry, Alain! We have
a swimming instructor with us...

40:19.411 --> 40:21.914
Ah, my little Daniel!
What a pleasure to see you again.

40:22.455 --> 40:23.707
Oh dear, you don't
look too good...

40:24.792 --> 40:26.376
I think you're spending too much
time with my daughter.

40:26.418 --> 40:30.380
Just kidding! At your age, it's
normal to have some fun...

40:30.422 --> 40:32.883
Have you seen my driver by any chance?
He's running late...

40:32.925 --> 40:35.594
l just saw him at the crossroad.
He'll be here in no time.

40:36.094 --> 40:36.929
Glad to hear it!

40:37.220 --> 40:38.722
Tell me, is Lily here
by any chance?

40:38.806 --> 40:40.599
Yes, she is.
LILY!

40:40.641 --> 40:42.475
I'm sorry darling,
I thought you were upstairs...

40:42.601 --> 40:44.352
It's ok, daddy,
I'm used to it...

40:44.937 --> 40:46.772
Look who is here...

40:46.814 --> 40:48.607
Good morning Lily.
Can we talk for a minute?

40:48.816 --> 40:52.069
Not now.
l have to go see my doctor...!

40:52.152 --> 40:53.779
Can you drop me off Daddy,
it's on your way...

40:53.821 --> 40:56.031
Sure, honey, if my driver
ever gets here...

40:56.114 --> 40:58.784
Now that you mention it,
I thought he had some trouble...

40:58.909 --> 41:01.036
Maybe I could drop you off...
both of you?

41:01.161 --> 41:02.079
Affirmative.

41:02.287 --> 41:05.833
It'll teach him to be late.
And now - all aboard!

41:10.337 --> 41:11.922
To the Boulevard Cassini, driver.

41:12.005 --> 41:13.131
Very well, Madam.

41:26.478 --> 41:29.648
Tell me, you are late! Daniel
kindly offered to drive us,

41:29.732 --> 41:32.317
so I'll meet you back at the
barracks after my appointment.

41:41.952 --> 41:43.746
Tell me, didn't you use
to drive a bit faster?

41:43.829 --> 41:46.874
Who, me? Well, there's a lot of people
on the streets this time of year...

41:46.915 --> 41:50.043
and there's a lot of potholes,
so I can't drive very fast...!

41:50.085 --> 41:53.088
Besides, taking things nice and easy
from time to time can't hurt...

41:53.171 --> 41:55.674
Indeed, just so long as I'm not late...

41:58.468 --> 41:59.845
What? What's wrong?

41:59.887 --> 42:00.679
It hurts!

42:00.721 --> 42:01.930
Where, honey?
What's hurting?

42:01.972 --> 42:02.347
My belly...!

42:02.389 --> 42:05.768
Your belly? But that's terrible!
What are we going to do, General?

42:05.809 --> 42:08.186
I have no idea!
Does it hurt very badly, darling?

42:10.773 --> 42:12.107
Noo - o.
It's over now.

42:12.149 --> 42:13.108
It's over?

42:13.150 --> 42:13.734
Yes, it's over.

42:13.942 --> 42:16.319
It's over!
It's over... it's over...

42:22.785 --> 42:25.871
Tell me Daniel, you're really a nervous
wreck today! What's wrong?

42:25.913 --> 42:29.667
lt's because Christmas is nearing...
All those presents... makes me nervous.

42:29.708 --> 42:33.003
l can see that... what's that
thing you got on your ear?

42:33.921 --> 42:38.634
Oh that...? Nothing, it's just
a new gadget: a stress-o-meter!

42:38.884 --> 42:41.136
One bar: nothing's wrong.
Two bars: nothing goes!

42:45.182 --> 42:46.517
Well apparently,
nothing goes!

42:46.559 --> 42:49.061
l know! That's why
I'm driving so slowly...

42:56.026 --> 42:58.737
Thank you for driving,
it was a pleasant trip.

42:58.946 --> 43:00.322
See you tonight, darling.

43:05.493 --> 43:08.455
I'll touch a word to my doctor, but
I'm afraid your case is desperate...

43:13.877 --> 43:17.005
Pardon me for intruding,
but I'm running late!

43:23.762 --> 43:25.138
And here we go...

43:44.950 --> 43:46.034
Come in.

43:49.538 --> 43:50.539
Peek-a-boo!

43:50.581 --> 43:51.498
Hello...

43:52.249 --> 43:52.666
AAAH...!

43:57.045 --> 43:58.005
Are you ok?

43:58.046 --> 44:00.298
l'm fine...
I'm fine...

44:00.340 --> 44:02.885
But you see, we're even betrayed
by our own equipment here!

44:02.926 --> 44:04.136
How am I supposed
to work like that?

44:04.553 --> 44:07.556
You should mention this in report.
We cruelly lack funding!

44:07.598 --> 44:10.809
We need more stable chairs,
and taller doors - see?

44:10.934 --> 44:13.311
Oh yeah, and we need
life jackets in our cars!

44:13.353 --> 44:15.898
You were there earlier - blub!
See?

44:16.732 --> 44:19.359
Besides, our shoes could be
more comfortable, too...

44:19.985 --> 44:21.820
My feet hurt terribly!
Ouch!

44:23.113 --> 44:24.532
Maybe if you removed this...?

44:24.573 --> 44:25.073
Oh...?

44:25.407 --> 44:27.993
Wonder who did that,
I hate those practical jokes!

44:28.786 --> 44:32.497
I've had sore feet for six months!
That ain't funny!

44:32.915 --> 44:34.583
You know, this makes
me all tense!

44:35.292 --> 44:39.797
Just relax, commissioner!
You are so nervous.

44:40.088 --> 44:43.133
lt's because of that gang,
the Santa Claus gang...

44:44.092 --> 44:47.513
Don't worry about it...
I'm going to take care of you.

44:51.725 --> 44:53.476
You know how to
use that thing?

44:53.811 --> 44:55.437
Yes, a little bit...

44:55.688 --> 45:00.442
They delivered it just last week.
Good thing I hid my typewriter!

45:03.445 --> 45:05.864
Just relax, commissioner...

45:05.948 --> 45:09.827
You'll feel better so much better...

45:09.868 --> 45:10.869
You think so?

45:11.119 --> 45:12.871
l am sure.

45:16.041 --> 45:18.794
But now I can't see anything...
is that normal?

45:18.836 --> 45:22.130
Yes, it's normal.
Just relax!

45:26.635 --> 45:30.472
That feels so good... eh?

45:34.643 --> 45:37.980
I feel like you're taking
all my worries away...

45:41.734 --> 45:45.070
That's exactly the case...
You'll see...!

45:45.195 --> 45:47.573
I think I'm falling asleep...

45:48.406 --> 45:50.075
l'll wake you up.

46:01.461 --> 46:02.588
That was terrific!

46:05.007 --> 46:08.010
What the fuck do you think you're doing?
You have any idea where you are?

46:08.051 --> 46:08.636
No, where am l?

46:08.677 --> 46:10.012
ln front of the police station!

46:10.053 --> 46:12.347
Oh, really? Looks more
like a garage to me...

46:12.389 --> 46:13.849
Just you wait, buddy...

46:17.102 --> 46:18.020
My respects, general!

46:18.145 --> 46:18.771
At ease!

46:19.855 --> 46:22.816
Thank you Daniel. l'll see you
tonight at home, then.

46:27.279 --> 46:29.406
Oh, Daniel! You're my savior!

46:29.907 --> 46:31.992
Could you do me a favor
and drop me somewhere?

46:32.034 --> 46:33.827
I don't drop my friends, but I can
give you a ride if you want...

46:33.869 --> 46:35.746
l am so glad to see you!

46:37.623 --> 46:39.792
Please, sir?
Has the problem subsided?

46:39.875 --> 46:41.126
Yes, I guess so...

46:41.168 --> 46:44.922
Oh, and would you please keep this
parking spot for me, I'll be back...

46:45.338 --> 46:46.173
Right...

46:51.136 --> 46:52.846
Hey, hey, slow down,
I got plenty of time!

46:52.888 --> 46:53.847
OK boss!

46:53.889 --> 46:55.641
Daniel, you won't believe
what's happening to me.

46:55.683 --> 46:57.309
Same here, you'll never guess
what's happening to me!

46:57.350 --> 47:00.103
Try to guess... it's something
absolutely unbelievable!

47:00.145 --> 47:00.938
You got promoted?

47:00.979 --> 47:03.899
No it's not about my job,
it's personal... come on, guess!

47:03.941 --> 47:04.399
You're getting married?

47:04.441 --> 47:06.610
Better than that Daniel!
I'M GONNA BE A DADDY!

47:07.903 --> 47:08.779
But that's impossible!

47:08.821 --> 47:10.072
Yes it is possible!

47:10.573 --> 47:11.907
Oh, it's wonderful...!

47:13.075 --> 47:14.326
Lily is pregnant too.

47:15.160 --> 47:16.203
No way!

47:17.329 --> 47:20.791
But... that's awesome Daniel,
we'll be daddies together!

47:22.334 --> 47:26.004
That's unbelievable... after all these
years of friendship, we'll...

47:26.296 --> 47:27.881
we'll have a child together!

47:30.175 --> 47:32.678
I mean... uh...
I mean, one each...

47:33.303 --> 47:34.763
... but at the same time.

47:35.180 --> 47:36.223
Each of us separately!

47:36.640 --> 47:38.726
Yeah... separately, yes!

47:40.185 --> 47:41.436
How long has she been pregnant?

47:41.520 --> 47:42.270
8 months.

47:42.354 --> 47:43.939
8 months?!
You could've told me earlier!

47:44.022 --> 47:46.233
I only found out this morning!
You're the first one to know.

47:46.316 --> 47:49.361
I haven't even told mommy yet!
What about you - how long?

47:50.070 --> 47:50.779
2 bars.

47:51.488 --> 47:52.280
What do you mean, "2 bars"?

47:52.364 --> 47:54.366
Yeah, that's some new gadget...
you pee on it,

47:54.407 --> 47:56.034
and it tells you how long
you've been pregnant.

47:56.118 --> 47:57.911
And well, it's been
2 bars for her.

47:59.121 --> 48:01.039
Oh yeah? That's cool.

48:02.290 --> 48:03.333
Yeah, it's cool...

48:14.386 --> 48:17.931
Commissioner...?
You've got visitors!

48:18.223 --> 48:19.600
What are you doing, Gibert?

48:20.225 --> 48:23.436
Aaah...!
It's a pleasure to see you again!

48:24.688 --> 48:26.899
Uh... that's nothing...
We were simply... that is...

48:26.940 --> 48:29.192
my colleague... she's Chinese...

48:29.568 --> 48:31.695
She was just showing me
a relaxation technique...

48:31.737 --> 48:34.406
How to get 5 hours of sleep
in 5 minutes... to save time.

48:34.447 --> 48:36.491
It gives you a lot of energy!

48:37.409 --> 48:41.496
However, today's class is over.
See you later, Commissioner!

48:41.539 --> 48:42.748
Thanks.

48:44.583 --> 48:46.293
Thanks, my little... Qiu.

48:50.548 --> 48:52.340
So, what can l do for you?

48:55.302 --> 48:58.806
She even put cauliflowers everywhere
in my office, but I was so busy...

48:58.847 --> 49:00.891
I didn't even notice that!
How stupid can I be?

49:00.933 --> 49:03.602
Very stupid,
but I had already noticed...

49:03.644 --> 49:04.853
But why cauliflower?

49:05.688 --> 49:09.232
What do I know? But I should at
least have noticed something...

49:09.274 --> 49:11.735
But no, nothing!
I'm such a loser, Daniel...

49:11.777 --> 49:15.280
Oh, stop it. If you were such a loser,
you wouldn't be the father!

49:15.363 --> 49:16.114
You think so?

49:16.156 --> 49:17.783
Of course! Petra
isn't masochistic...!

49:19.242 --> 49:21.203
Thanks.
That's a bit reassuring.

49:21.244 --> 49:24.456
Oh, don't be too reassured,
we're still in deep shit!

49:24.790 --> 49:25.373
How's that?

49:25.415 --> 49:27.585
Well, you're always
chasing thieves...

49:27.626 --> 49:30.921
I'm always tinkering with an engine,
no wonder they're freaking out!

49:32.590 --> 49:35.718
And I'm not an expert, but a kid
must need some room... and time!

49:36.552 --> 49:39.638
Guess we'll have to change habits and
stop worrying only about our jobs...

49:39.680 --> 49:42.474
You're right! We have to watch him
take his first steps, go to school...

49:46.353 --> 49:48.188
Oh, really?
So we'll have to seal them all up?

49:48.230 --> 49:49.064
I suppose so...

49:49.147 --> 49:53.235
Oh...? That's just insane...
How can you prepare for it?

49:54.903 --> 49:56.989
That's some good shit...
Did you get it from Rashid?

49:57.030 --> 49:59.908
Yep... hold on, you know Rashid?

49:59.992 --> 50:02.745
Well yeah, a little...

50:04.496 --> 50:05.748
The sun is coming out...

50:12.420 --> 50:16.258
Hey Daniel... Santa riding a scooter,
isn't that a bit weird?

50:18.468 --> 50:19.928
Yeah... he's supposed
to ride a sleigh...

50:20.971 --> 50:23.641
Watch this... he's discreet yet
nervous, that's not normal!

50:23.682 --> 50:27.227
Hey... just 5 minutes ago we agreed
to stop worrying about the job

50:27.269 --> 50:30.981
to spend more time with our kids,
so drop the hot pursuit idea!

50:31.189 --> 50:32.024
Follow him!

50:32.107 --> 50:33.901
Aye aye... Commissioner!

50:54.129 --> 50:57.675
I need verification on a scooter,
registration N 75BM13, over.

51:00.803 --> 51:02.054
It was stolen 2 weeks ago!

51:02.095 --> 51:03.889
Yes! You see,
it pays to persevere!

51:03.931 --> 51:05.808
You better tell Petra about it...

51:05.849 --> 51:06.850
Daniel, we'll just follow it,

51:06.892 --> 51:09.562
localize his HQ and hand the case
over to Gibert. You have my word!

51:10.395 --> 51:11.021
Ok.

51:11.063 --> 51:13.524
You're a real friend,.
What would I do without you?

51:13.566 --> 51:14.775
Screw things up
even more?

51:14.817 --> 51:16.026
Yeah, for sure...

51:21.489 --> 51:23.742
We're losing him!
The first lead I got in 8 months,

51:23.784 --> 51:25.202
and I'm fucking losing it!

51:25.410 --> 51:27.913
Hey, calm down!
There's a solution to every problem.

51:28.747 --> 51:30.207
Daniel, what are you doing...?

51:33.752 --> 51:35.170
Daniel, what's wrong with you...!

51:35.212 --> 51:37.089
You got a better idea
to follow a scooter?

51:37.464 --> 51:40.175
Uh... no!
But we'll get noticed!

51:40.425 --> 51:42.260
Just act naturally,
you'll be fine!

51:42.302 --> 51:45.013
"Act naturally"?
Oh, alright...

52:16.294 --> 52:19.798
So... now that you found his HQ,
you call the Commissioner!

52:19.840 --> 52:23.594
Hold on. I screwed up last time,
this time I want to make sure!

52:23.677 --> 52:27.931
Hey! You have a Santa, a stolen scooter
and an abandoned storehouse.

52:27.973 --> 52:29.600
What more do you want?
His legal file?

52:29.642 --> 52:32.352
I just want to make sure!
Come on, give me 5 minutes!

52:43.405 --> 52:44.447
Bingo!

52:44.489 --> 52:47.743
Is that enough, or you want to
check if they have real guns?

52:47.785 --> 52:49.244
Nah, that's ok...

52:50.287 --> 52:51.747
But we should find out
how many they are.

52:52.998 --> 52:53.832
Follow me!

52:55.709 --> 52:59.254
Will you stop it? You said that you'll
hand the case to the commissioner.

52:59.296 --> 53:01.924
Yes, but the first question he'll ask
will be "how many are they?"

53:01.965 --> 53:04.259
And I need to know if this is their
HQ or only a secondary base.

53:04.342 --> 53:05.928
Come on, just give me 5 minutes!

53:25.113 --> 53:27.365
Émilien, l got a bad feeling
about this. Don't do it!

53:27.407 --> 53:30.744
Don't worry, I've seen it in a movie.
You force the body to do what you want.

53:30.786 --> 53:31.579
It's all in your head.

53:31.620 --> 53:33.246
I know, that's what worries me!

53:33.455 --> 53:34.873
If something happens to
me, you call Gibert.

53:34.915 --> 53:37.626
Émilien... your shoe's untied!

53:43.298 --> 53:45.050
Oh dear...

53:51.181 --> 53:51.807
Hello?

53:51.849 --> 53:53.642
I'm back from my physician,
does that interest you?

53:54.226 --> 53:56.186
Oh yes, if he's a good doctor!

53:56.228 --> 53:57.646
He's an excellent doctor!

53:57.771 --> 54:01.734
The prefect's daughter recommended him,
and she had 4 children in 4 years!

54:01.817 --> 54:03.902
Well that's gonna be tough to beat...

54:03.944 --> 54:05.571
Yes, especially if we don't
see each other again!

54:05.613 --> 54:09.533
Listen Lily. I'll do anything, but
you should give me a chance!

54:09.742 --> 54:10.951
So what I propose is...

54:10.993 --> 54:12.661
Why are you whispering like that?

54:12.703 --> 54:15.122
Because of the Santas! They just
pulled Émilen out of the trash can

54:15.163 --> 54:16.624
and I think they're going to...

54:17.666 --> 54:19.752
Lily? Lily!

54:20.794 --> 54:21.837
Oh shit...

54:41.439 --> 54:42.691
But... what are
you doing here?

54:43.526 --> 54:44.359
Guess...

54:44.693 --> 54:48.321
You're wasting your time.
Torture me, I won't say a word!

54:48.363 --> 54:50.783
We do not need
to make you talk.

54:50.824 --> 54:55.203
We already know everything.
Besides, torture is out of fashion.

54:56.038 --> 54:59.958
There are much more effective
methods to make a man talking.

55:00.000 --> 55:00.834
No kidding?

55:02.711 --> 55:04.755
For example, tenderness...

55:06.048 --> 55:08.551
lt can be a very
dangerous weapon.

55:09.802 --> 55:13.305
Tell me, what is a handsome man
like you doing in a place like this?

55:13.346 --> 55:15.641
Just doing my job...
Ah, no! Don't do that!

55:16.474 --> 55:19.978
Yet you are not insensible
to my "arguments"...

55:20.020 --> 55:21.814
Yes I am!
That's my cell phone!

55:21.897 --> 55:23.982
Ah...? Let's have a look...

55:25.233 --> 55:27.528
Oh, what a nice model!

55:28.571 --> 55:31.031
But it's shut off...
I'm going to turn it on.

55:31.073 --> 55:32.324
No!
You can't do that!

55:33.158 --> 55:34.577
I'm out of credits...

55:34.827 --> 55:36.286
That's against basic
human rights!

55:44.920 --> 55:46.714
That's inhuman,
what you're doing to me...

55:48.423 --> 55:50.884
They say hunger justifies the means...

55:51.093 --> 55:53.804
and l am very hungry!

56:01.103 --> 56:03.355
Petra!

56:03.396 --> 56:07.568
Can't answer now because I'm very busy.
Leave your ID and I'll keep you posted.

56:07.860 --> 56:11.947
Émilien, it's Petra. l guess you
are on a mission again.

56:13.616 --> 56:15.701
I just wanted to tell you
that I am proud of you.

56:15.743 --> 56:17.995
Of your dedication
to your work.

56:18.203 --> 56:20.706
I know how you put all your
energy in everything you do.

56:21.123 --> 56:23.291
But you should also think about
yourself from time to time.

56:23.876 --> 56:26.545
You should relax a little,
find some pleasure in life.

56:27.379 --> 56:30.090
And maybe we could spend
a little more time together...

56:30.340 --> 56:33.844
That's all. Call me back
when you're done. Kiss!

56:38.682 --> 56:39.683
Hello Daniel...!

56:44.479 --> 56:47.149
Why are you still here? Have you
seen Émilien, I can't find him!

56:47.190 --> 56:48.609
Actually I have seen him,
he got kidnapped!

56:48.651 --> 56:50.694
Kidnapped?! You're kidding,
what good would that do?

56:50.736 --> 56:53.238
What do I know! They were all disguised
as Santa and loaded with weapons!

56:53.280 --> 56:54.907
Dressed as Santa? It must
be the Santa Claus gang!

56:55.323 --> 56:56.534
I guessed that much...

56:56.575 --> 56:58.661
Good job, Émilien! He picked up their
trail again - by himself!

56:58.702 --> 56:59.452
Actually we BOTH did!

56:59.494 --> 57:02.414
They're as good as dead!
I got an infaillible plan!

57:02.748 --> 57:03.666
And Émilien?

57:04.291 --> 57:06.168
He'll be fine Daniel, trust me!

57:08.629 --> 57:09.588
Get in the car!

57:10.338 --> 57:14.927
Would you mind sticking around with us?
I got a BAD feeling about this mission!

57:14.968 --> 57:15.761
And Émilien?

57:16.178 --> 57:17.012
Ah, Émilien...

57:17.846 --> 57:19.515
Once we find the Santa Claus
gang, we find Émilien...

57:19.598 --> 57:22.643
but... will he still be alive?
Who knows...

57:23.686 --> 57:24.728
That's promising...

57:34.112 --> 57:35.030
Commissioner!

57:35.155 --> 57:36.406
Ah, good timing!

57:37.032 --> 57:38.491
We're just about to catch
the Santa Claus gang,

57:38.534 --> 57:41.829
we'll throw them right
into the sack, those Santas!

57:42.663 --> 57:44.540
Can... can I come with you, please?

57:44.582 --> 57:46.374
Absolutely not.
It's way too dangerous,

57:46.416 --> 57:49.127
and this arrest won't be a pretty
Christmas story, trust me!

57:49.753 --> 57:52.881
Oh, Commissioner... please...

57:53.090 --> 57:55.383
Uh...? OK, let's go then,
it's not very far...

57:56.218 --> 57:58.470
Hey!
Follow us, ok?

58:13.736 --> 58:14.570
Spread out!

58:23.120 --> 58:24.371
Yep, Christmas time is here!

58:24.412 --> 58:28.000
I'm gonna hit them with some
early fireworks, wait and see!

58:28.250 --> 58:29.543
How do you know they are here?

58:29.585 --> 58:33.756
I got my own spies! My brother Jean-
Robert works with the City Sewage...

58:33.797 --> 58:36.675
he took the police exam
with me, but failed...

58:36.717 --> 58:38.010
even though he copied
everything off me!

58:38.051 --> 58:41.889
but he messed up the order of the
answers, so he got it all wrong!

58:41.930 --> 58:44.349
You know, that happens all the time!
A friend of mine...

58:44.391 --> 58:45.392
Ok, ok, enough!

58:45.643 --> 58:47.520
Anyway, he called me last night

58:47.561 --> 58:51.064
and told me about suspicious activities
in the mall, so I investigated...

58:51.106 --> 58:55.027
And what did I find? A tunnel
between the bank and the mall!

58:55.861 --> 58:59.823
Of course! That way they'll steal
the money and spend it right away!

58:59.948 --> 59:06.079
No! Sunday, they'll rob the CLOSED bank
and leave by the OPEN mall - as Santa!

59:06.121 --> 59:08.666
Of course! Nobody will notice them
since there are Santas everywhere!

59:08.707 --> 59:11.502
Exactly! And that's why they've been
dressing up as Santa from the beginning

59:11.544 --> 59:13.796
in preparation of that hold-up!
It's the biggest bank in Marseille.

59:14.296 --> 59:16.715
Of course, of course...!
Commissioner, you are a genius!

59:16.757 --> 59:19.843
No, no, Alain... I got an inherent
talent, that's true...

59:20.135 --> 59:22.137
but it's really just a
question of training.

59:22.971 --> 59:23.889
It is!

59:24.139 --> 59:25.223
Can l make a phone call?

59:25.265 --> 59:26.099
Suit yourself!

59:27.976 --> 59:29.853
Oh, ain't that funny,
Émilien's got the same one!

59:34.817 --> 59:35.275
Yes.

59:35.693 --> 59:37.611
The stupid cops found out everything.

59:37.653 --> 59:40.072
Switch to plan B.

59:40.906 --> 59:42.575
- OK!
- OK. Bye.

59:43.325 --> 59:45.703
That's such a nice language...
I mean, Chinese...

59:45.994 --> 59:46.954
It just melts in your ear!

59:47.037 --> 59:48.413
Chief, there's activity
in the parking lot.

59:48.455 --> 59:52.793
On your marks. If that four wheeled
monster appears, nail it on the spot!

59:52.918 --> 59:54.044
Roger that!

59:54.461 --> 59:57.255
The Christmas vacation is over,
Gibert will make sure of that!

01:00:00.425 --> 01:00:01.426
What the hell is that?

01:00:03.011 --> 01:00:04.888
Hey, where's that
big monster truck?

01:00:07.182 --> 01:00:10.519
They're getting away!
Do something!

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.481
l commandeer this vehicle.
Alain, follow me!

01:00:32.207 --> 01:00:35.127
We have a beautiful view
over Marseille from here.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:38.005
l see that. ls it quiet,
in wintertime?

01:00:38.046 --> 01:00:38.964
Oh yes, very quiet.

01:00:39.006 --> 01:00:39.923
STOP!

01:00:44.094 --> 01:00:45.178
Commissioner, wait for me!

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.848
Stop... in the name of the Law!

01:00:48.473 --> 01:00:52.019
Like I told you, Minister,
we are cruelly underfunded.

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.147
Indeed... one bike for two
officers, that's too little.

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:56.607
Way too little, yes...

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:54.039
Tell the chopper pilot
we'll be in time.

01:02:01.046 --> 01:02:03.549
l will miss you,
my little Émilien...

01:02:03.966 --> 01:02:07.094
But because l like you,
I won't make you suffer...

01:02:07.135 --> 01:02:07.678
Gee, thanks...

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:12.516
You will even have the privilege to
know the exact time of your death

01:02:12.558 --> 01:02:16.311
thanks to this highly precise
device... that's my Swiss side...!

01:02:25.654 --> 01:02:31.702
This device will set free that ball,
which will swing along the cable...

01:02:31.744 --> 01:02:34.622
and you'll have the
best seat for the show.

01:02:34.830 --> 01:02:37.708
Uh... how much time will I have?

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.252
You'll have exactly 5 minutes.

01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:41.504
Great...!

01:02:41.545 --> 01:02:45.883
Use your time well to purify
your soul, Émilien...

01:02:45.924 --> 01:02:49.845
It is important to thoroughly clean
your soul and come to peace...

01:02:49.887 --> 01:02:52.347
before you face your Maker.

01:02:52.389 --> 01:02:54.642
Only 5 minutes to clean up that
mess, that's a little tight there...

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:56.519
Focus on the essential, then...

01:03:04.527 --> 01:03:07.154
I'm keeping your cell
phone as a souvenir.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.447
I am a bit sentimental...

01:03:10.282 --> 01:03:11.742
that's my Chinese side.

01:03:20.709 --> 01:03:22.795
Clean up my soul...
Yeah, right...!

01:03:36.767 --> 01:03:38.852
Right here and now, I would
sure appreciate a miracle!

01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:40.103
Even a small one...!

01:03:47.402 --> 01:03:48.862
Oh no, not the ball...!

01:03:50.072 --> 01:03:51.156
Oh no, not the taxi!

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.877
Daniel! You can't imagine
what has happened to me.

01:04:04.002 --> 01:04:07.840
lt was terrible, we must find her!
She took my cell phone...

01:04:08.674 --> 01:04:10.968
I mean, they also got
all the money...

01:04:11.009 --> 01:04:13.470
but the cell phone... that cell
phone was a gift from Petra!

01:04:13.512 --> 01:04:16.389
Imagine what would happen if she
calls and a Chinese girl answers...

01:04:16.599 --> 01:04:19.727
Uh, Émilien...? Tell me, did I just
save your life or was it a dream?

01:04:19.768 --> 01:04:22.395
Well, yes... so what? I would've
done the same for you!

01:04:22.437 --> 01:04:25.566
Oh yeah? That way I would have died
crushed by a cop car, that's great!

01:04:25.983 --> 01:04:28.276
Don't say that. My driving
has improved a lot!

01:04:28.485 --> 01:04:31.572
But your manners haven't! How about
saying "thank you for saving my life"?

01:04:31.614 --> 01:04:34.742
If I don't catch that gang,
you saved my life for nothing.

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.035
Gibert will kill me because
I screwed up again!

01:04:37.202 --> 01:04:40.330
We'll find that gang, but first,
tell me: ''Thank you''!

01:04:40.372 --> 01:04:44.126
Oh yeah? How are we gonna find
it, we don't have a single clue!

01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:45.377
Say: "Thank you"!

01:04:45.418 --> 01:04:47.004
THANK YOU!
THERE, ARE YOU HAPPY?

01:04:47.045 --> 01:04:48.130
YEAH!

01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:55.596
l'm sorry, buddy.
I'm so sorry!

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:59.558
It's... it's my nerves, I just
can't take it anymore.

01:05:00.809 --> 01:05:02.477
The Chinese girl, she...

01:05:03.103 --> 01:05:06.023
She tortured me for hours,
it's hard to recover from it.

01:05:06.649 --> 01:05:07.691
She tortured you?

01:05:07.733 --> 01:05:09.568
Yes. lt was terrible!

01:05:11.236 --> 01:05:12.070
What kind of tortures?

01:05:12.112 --> 01:05:14.156
Oh my, she did things I didn't
even know you could do!

01:05:14.573 --> 01:05:18.744
l mean, you can't imagine the things
she did. In fact I'm still sore...

01:05:19.995 --> 01:05:22.706
I mean, it hurts me just
from talking about it, Daniel.

01:05:23.624 --> 01:05:24.583
l see.

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:30.088
Don't worry... we'll catch that
Chinese chick. Come with me.

01:05:32.925 --> 01:05:34.968
Did you see, did you overhear
anything that could help us?

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:35.636
No...

01:05:35.844 --> 01:05:39.181
She was telling about a chopper pilot
set to pick them up somewhere, but...

01:05:39.598 --> 01:05:40.849
She had fur on her boots.

01:05:40.891 --> 01:05:41.892
Fur on her boots?

01:05:43.351 --> 01:05:44.352
You don't feel anything?

01:05:44.394 --> 01:05:45.020
No...

01:05:45.437 --> 01:05:46.271
It's cold...

01:05:46.689 --> 01:05:48.566
Oh yeah, you're right...
is that melted snow?

01:05:48.607 --> 01:05:52.319
Yes. And that means two things.
It's from somewhere high up and nearby.

01:05:53.153 --> 01:05:55.864
And... since they were wearing fur
boots, they're going back there...?

01:05:56.699 --> 01:05:57.741
Probably...

01:05:58.158 --> 01:06:00.452
But why would they take all that
money on a mountain top?

01:06:00.661 --> 01:06:01.912
What's on the other side
of the mountain...?

01:06:04.832 --> 01:06:06.083
Switzerland...

01:06:06.709 --> 01:06:07.751
But of course!

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.671
Daniel, she's half Swiss,
so she knows the place!

01:06:10.879 --> 01:06:13.340
They'll travel by car as high as
possible, then ski back down...

01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:15.467
and what with all the tourists
there, nobody will notice them!

01:06:15.801 --> 01:06:18.596
And from the Swiss ski station,
they're taking a chopper to the bank!

01:06:18.637 --> 01:06:20.055
That plan is awesome!

01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:25.060
So now we're looking for a ski station
that's close to the Swiss border...

01:06:25.102 --> 01:06:28.396
where you can land a chopper
and has a lot of tourists.

01:06:30.482 --> 01:06:31.942
- Val d'lsère!
- Val d'lsère!

01:06:41.535 --> 01:06:42.536
Did you just see something?

01:06:42.578 --> 01:06:44.037
No. Absolutely nothing.

01:06:44.663 --> 01:06:47.374
Sentinel N1, negative.
Nothing to report here.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.251
So where are you going
to spend your holidays?

01:06:49.292 --> 01:06:52.170
Bof, we haven't decided yet...
Probably in the snow somewhere.

01:07:22.618 --> 01:07:25.328
Now we can only hope that we
were right in our deductions...

01:07:25.538 --> 01:07:27.790
and their car is around
here somewhere.

01:07:27.831 --> 01:07:29.917
You look on the right,
I'll look on the left.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:30.751
OK.

01:07:33.461 --> 01:07:35.964
Émilien, don't tell me you can't
tell your right from your left!

01:07:36.048 --> 01:07:38.676
Oh, you mean on
YOUR right side!

01:07:39.301 --> 01:07:40.553
I'm in front of you,
so that's MY left...

01:07:40.636 --> 01:07:42.429
You're not in front of me,
you're sitting besides me!

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:45.558
Yes, but I imagined I was sitting
in front of you, and if I was, I...

01:07:46.809 --> 01:07:47.392
What...?

01:07:47.434 --> 01:07:48.686
Daniel! The car!

01:07:49.728 --> 01:07:50.353
Got'cha!

01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.648
Let's take a shortcut, turn
right as soon as you can!

01:07:52.898 --> 01:07:53.857
Why, you know this place?

01:07:53.899 --> 01:07:57.235
Never mind, all these ski stations
are the same. Turn right, trust me!

01:07:57.277 --> 01:08:00.155
Tell you what, I'd rather
trust myself and turn... right!

01:08:03.909 --> 01:08:04.952
Watch out!

01:08:10.916 --> 01:08:11.834
That was a close one!

01:08:13.919 --> 01:08:14.962
What is this road, Daniel?

01:08:15.003 --> 01:08:16.839
l don't know,
watch out for signs!

01:08:21.218 --> 01:08:23.303
Don't these cars look a bit strange?

01:08:23.511 --> 01:08:26.223
Nah, they're local plates...
Must be ski instructors...

01:08:26.264 --> 01:08:27.474
What are those signs saying?

01:08:28.725 --> 01:08:31.185
Says "1 min 10 sec, 2nd place"
Isn't that disturbing?

01:08:31.228 --> 01:08:32.688
Not at all, we'll do better
on the second lap...

01:08:56.294 --> 01:08:57.505
Oh shit...

01:08:57.546 --> 01:08:59.590
Look, those tracks
are from a ratrack!

01:08:59.631 --> 01:09:01.675
They must have transferred the
money into it and continued uphill.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.344
We'll never catch them,
the pursuit is over!

01:09:04.386 --> 01:09:05.845
The pursuit never stops.

01:09:11.059 --> 01:09:14.813
Daniel, I know you're fast, but
a taxi can't climb a mountain!

01:09:15.229 --> 01:09:16.689
Nothing is impossible
to a stout heart!

01:09:24.406 --> 01:09:26.283
What do you think about
my winter collection?

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:29.411
Oh yeah, not bad at all!

01:09:30.245 --> 01:09:31.246
Tell me, you've tested this, right?

01:09:31.287 --> 01:09:32.122
No, never...

01:09:40.881 --> 01:09:42.340
Hey, it seems to be working!

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:43.341
Yeah I guess so...

01:09:43.383 --> 01:09:45.468
But how are we going to
find them in all that snow?

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:47.930
How about following
their tracks, for example?

01:09:47.970 --> 01:09:50.057
Oh yes, that's a clever idea!

01:09:53.185 --> 01:09:55.688
If they manage to escape in a chopper,
is your taxi equipped for that?

01:09:55.896 --> 01:09:58.398
Émilien, don't overdo it! That's
already pretty good, don't you think?

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.318
Oh, I'm not complaining! But maybe
I should call the general, then...

01:10:01.527 --> 01:10:02.778
What an excellent idea!

01:10:02.986 --> 01:10:05.698
Uh, can I borrow your cell phone?
The Chinese girl still got mine...

01:10:11.954 --> 01:10:16.333
Put the money into the rucksacks.
We must leave before sundown.

01:10:25.718 --> 01:10:26.552
Back to work!

01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:36.353
You think they are still there?

01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:37.813
That's hard to say...

01:10:43.235 --> 01:10:43.861
Hello?

01:10:43.986 --> 01:10:46.947
Oh, Émilien! Operation ''Snow-white''
has already started.

01:10:46.989 --> 01:10:50.909
I'll be with you in 10 minutes.
Your Commissioner is with me,

01:10:50.951 --> 01:10:52.828
he insisted to participate
in the operation!

01:10:53.036 --> 01:10:54.496
Oh, no...!

01:10:55.748 --> 01:10:56.999
- Commissioner!
- Yes?

01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.084
Are you sure that's a good idea?

01:11:00.335 --> 01:11:03.421
Alain, l served for 18 months
in the Chasseurs Alpins,

01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:07.801
13th batallion, special forces!
So I know about mountains!

01:11:07.926 --> 01:11:10.137
Alright, but... we are high up here!

01:11:10.178 --> 01:11:11.805
Have you ever seen
snow before, Alain?

01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:13.682
Well... you know,
I'm from around here...!

01:11:14.725 --> 01:11:17.019
Ah...? Oh.
Ok then, let's go!

01:11:18.687 --> 01:11:19.730
Ok, hit the road!

01:11:20.981 --> 01:11:22.816
I'm going to take a look.
Don't want to take chances.

01:11:22.858 --> 01:11:23.859
I wouldn't do that
if I were you...

01:11:23.901 --> 01:11:25.152
Relax, just give
me 5 minutes...

01:11:27.404 --> 01:11:29.532
Damn it - it's always
the same story!

01:11:38.498 --> 01:11:40.876
You were right.
We should stay together.

01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.091
See that? You could have waited
instead of ruining my carpet...

01:11:48.133 --> 01:11:49.217
Take it easy, it's just water!

01:11:49.259 --> 01:11:52.220
No, for now it's still snow,
and snow leaves traces!

01:11:52.262 --> 01:11:53.471
Alright, I'll clean up
your fucking car!

01:11:53.514 --> 01:11:54.932
Oh yeah? How are you
gonna do that?

01:11:54.973 --> 01:11:58.727
l said, l'll clean it!
How, is my problem!

01:12:06.234 --> 01:12:07.277
Come on! Let's go.

01:12:12.407 --> 01:12:13.283
You know how to ski?

01:12:13.325 --> 01:12:14.367
No, but I know
how to drive!

01:13:25.898 --> 01:13:27.983
Damn it!
Follow me!

01:13:31.945 --> 01:13:33.363
Hey! lt's a forest, Daniel!

01:13:33.405 --> 01:13:34.615
So what? Are you scared in a forest?

01:13:34.657 --> 01:13:35.908
No, I'm scared in a car!

01:13:40.078 --> 01:13:41.955
Uh... what... what are
you doing, Daniel?

01:13:42.372 --> 01:13:44.249
Well, I think I can put
the tires back on now...

01:13:49.254 --> 01:13:51.965
There, we localized the chopper!
Get ready!

01:13:55.719 --> 01:13:57.137
Chief! Are you sure that...?

01:13:57.179 --> 01:14:00.724
Shut up Alain, I checked everything
myself this time. I'll be just fine!

01:14:00.933 --> 01:14:02.685
Ok boys, here we go!

01:14:25.541 --> 01:14:26.374
What happened?

01:14:31.589 --> 01:14:33.256
Wait for me-e-aah!

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:46.979
I think the cord is
a little too short...

01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.897
Of course it's too short!

01:14:51.817 --> 01:14:52.860
Wait, you can't do that!

01:14:52.901 --> 01:14:54.111
Oh yeah? Watch me!

01:14:57.447 --> 01:14:58.073
There we go.

01:14:59.116 --> 01:15:00.784
Wait for me...!

01:15:09.752 --> 01:15:14.548
And here comes Hans Gerhardt,
from Austria, he's the number 10...

01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:16.216
in a great shape this season...

01:15:18.093 --> 01:15:19.970
Are you sure we're on the road?

01:15:20.012 --> 01:15:22.472
I think that as long as we
follow these poles, we're good...

01:15:23.181 --> 01:15:27.269
After his record in Kitzbühl and
on this optimal race track,

01:15:27.477 --> 01:15:30.606
it's hard to think of anybody
that could outrace him...

01:15:35.193 --> 01:15:38.739
He has set a record
on all intermediary times...

01:15:41.659 --> 01:15:44.787
He is literally flying across
this World Championship...

01:15:50.626 --> 01:15:53.546
This victory cannot escape him...

01:15:56.882 --> 01:16:00.969
Ooops - it did. A... taxi...
beats him by a split-second.

01:16:17.945 --> 01:16:19.196
lt's too calm...

01:16:37.130 --> 01:16:39.007
You could leave me
a little souvenir...

01:16:39.049 --> 01:16:40.884
Souvenirs aren't allowed
where you're headed to.

01:16:41.093 --> 01:16:42.970
However, you will have
plenty of time to clean up!

01:16:44.847 --> 01:16:45.889
Ok, take her away!

01:16:50.268 --> 01:16:54.439
Tell me, you don't seem to be very angry
considering she tortured you for hours!

01:16:55.691 --> 01:16:57.317
Well... bygones are
bygones, right?

01:16:57.359 --> 01:16:57.776
Sure...

01:16:57.818 --> 01:17:00.445
Oh, by the way, you haven't seen
Gibert? Shouldn't he be here?

01:17:00.487 --> 01:17:01.739
l'm coming!

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.198
Well yeah, there he is!

01:17:03.406 --> 01:17:06.702
O- oh! l am comi-i-ng!

01:17:06.744 --> 01:17:09.663
Chief! Be careful when
you're landing!

01:17:09.872 --> 01:17:13.000
Oh, don't worry Émilien,
it's just snow...

01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:15.711
Banzai...!

01:17:18.005 --> 01:17:20.090
Oh dear... the water must
be pretty cool, too!

01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:28.849
Hello!

01:17:28.932 --> 01:17:31.560
Émilien? My waters broke,
I'm about to give birth!

01:17:31.644 --> 01:17:33.812
What, you're giving birth?
Here? Right now?

01:17:33.854 --> 01:17:35.272
Well it's gonna take some
time, but hurry up!

01:17:35.313 --> 01:17:37.608
I'm coming Petra!
I'll be there right away!

01:17:41.153 --> 01:17:43.238
Commissioner!
Petra is having a baby!

01:17:44.281 --> 01:17:46.158
And guess who's getting
another job...

01:17:46.366 --> 01:17:47.409
Daniel!

01:17:54.082 --> 01:17:58.253
l'm here, l'm here!
Everything will be fine now.

01:17:59.087 --> 01:18:02.007
I beg you, please don't faint!
It's not the right time for this!

01:18:02.049 --> 01:18:05.553
Don't worry, everything be fine.
You hear me? You'll be fine!

01:18:08.055 --> 01:18:09.932
Émilien, that's not the right time!
You gotta cope with this!

01:18:11.517 --> 01:18:14.102
Watch over the monitor.
You'll see the contractions coming.

01:18:14.186 --> 01:18:16.188
- I'll see contractions on a screen?
- Yes.

01:18:16.396 --> 01:18:19.107
Watch a screen, watch a screen...
which one shows contractions?

01:18:19.191 --> 01:18:20.317
It must be this one...

01:18:21.819 --> 01:18:22.444
Yes, it's that one!

01:18:22.485 --> 01:18:23.486
Push! Push!

01:18:23.696 --> 01:18:24.947
But where do I push?

01:18:24.988 --> 01:18:27.449
Not you! She has to push
at every contraction!

01:18:27.866 --> 01:18:28.701
Contractions!

01:18:29.785 --> 01:18:32.454
Push, honey, push, push!

01:18:32.663 --> 01:18:34.331
Now breathe, breathe!

01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:38.293
Not you! She has to breathe!

01:18:38.335 --> 01:18:40.588
Breathe darling, breathe, breathe!

01:18:42.464 --> 01:18:43.298
Contractions!

01:18:43.924 --> 01:18:46.594
Push! Push!

01:18:46.635 --> 01:18:47.678
Get out of here!

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.389
Push! Get it out of here!
Come on, push, push!

01:18:51.431 --> 01:18:52.224
Now breathe...

01:18:52.265 --> 01:18:56.019
Ok, breathe!
Man the bellows, breathe, breathe!

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.566
Ok, one more time,
I can see the head!

01:19:00.608 --> 01:19:01.859
The head...?

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:02.901
Contractions, Émilien!

01:19:02.943 --> 01:19:07.906
Ok darling, push the head!
Push the head! Push it outta there!

01:19:07.948 --> 01:19:08.949
Contractions!

01:19:09.575 --> 01:19:10.576
Almost there!

01:19:10.618 --> 01:19:15.163
One more time my love, push!
Push! Breathe! Sneeze! Puke!

01:19:15.205 --> 01:19:16.874
Ok, now relax.

01:19:19.585 --> 01:19:21.879
Relax, relax, relax...

01:19:23.338 --> 01:19:24.798
It's a beautiful baby boy.

01:19:25.007 --> 01:19:26.049
Relax everything...

01:19:34.808 --> 01:19:36.268
I'm a daddy...

01:19:39.605 --> 01:19:41.064
Would you like to cut
the umbilical cord?

01:19:43.984 --> 01:19:47.112
Maybe we should wait a little
with that if you don't mind...

01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:05.881
What are you doing here?

01:20:05.964 --> 01:20:06.924
Training...

01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:08.801
Why? Are you pregnant?

01:20:09.217 --> 01:20:10.886
No, but the woman
l love is pregnant.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.388
And I want to be ready
when my time comes.

01:20:14.848 --> 01:20:18.811
Where did you find a woman stupid enough
to have a baby with a draft of air?

01:20:18.894 --> 01:20:22.773
l was very lucky.
And I promised her things.

01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:24.232
Like what?

01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:28.987
To spend more time with her than with
my car, to become the best of daddies...

01:20:29.029 --> 01:20:29.655
And the fridge?

01:20:29.697 --> 01:20:30.488
The fridge is empty!

01:20:30.906 --> 01:20:34.660
I would also be the best of husbands,
if she agrees to marry me, that is...

01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:36.745
And did she believe you?

01:20:36.954 --> 01:20:37.788
Not at all!

01:20:38.622 --> 01:20:41.083
In fact, it's the first time in her life
that she made a real mistake.

01:20:41.959 --> 01:20:43.627
Because right now,
I was absolutely sincere.

01:20:46.338 --> 01:20:49.257
What men lack is not sincerity,
it's the time to apply it.

01:20:49.883 --> 01:20:52.177
The time to make all these
nice words possible.

01:20:53.846 --> 01:20:55.514
Lily, would you marry me?

01:20:56.557 --> 01:20:59.059
That's easy, now that you made me
pregnant, you feel compelled...

01:20:59.184 --> 01:20:59.893
Lily!

01:21:01.353 --> 01:21:05.315
In any case, you're not doing it right.
We are very traditional in our family!

01:21:09.277 --> 01:21:11.989
Lily, would you give me the
honour to become my wife?

01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:14.282
It depends...

01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.743
Depends on what?

01:21:16.702 --> 01:21:18.245
On how good of
a lover you are...

01:21:19.496 --> 01:21:20.497
You got one hour
to convince me!

01:21:20.539 --> 01:21:21.582
You'll never last!

01:21:21.999 --> 01:21:23.041
Wanna bet?

01:21:24.084 --> 01:21:26.795
"Intensive care"

01:21:33.677 --> 01:21:35.137
Émilien...

01:21:37.014 --> 01:21:39.099
Émilien!
