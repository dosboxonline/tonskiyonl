00:02.169 --> 00:06.507
Go, Sam Obisanya.
Go, Sam Obisanya.

00:06.590 --> 00:09.259
Today has been all about one man.

00:11.261 --> 00:16.265
Take a bow, Sam Obisanya.
The first hat trick of his career.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.018
Three goals for Obisanya.

00:18.101 --> 00:22.689
Three points for Richmond
as their incredible run of form continues.

00:22.773 --> 00:25.442
They will now enter
the final match of the season

00:25.526 --> 00:29.321
one win away
from promotion back to the Premier League.

00:29.821 --> 00:31.990
An incredible turnaround.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.743
Thataway, Sam!

00:34.826 --> 00:37.955
What a performance by
the young Nigerian, Chris.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.291
It's exciting to see a young player
realizing his potential, Arlo.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.796
-One more, one more. One more.
-All right, bro. See you later.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.048
See you later. All right. Peace.

00:49.591 --> 00:50.592
Yeah.

00:50.676 --> 00:51.885
-Bravo, Sam.
-Three goals.

00:51.969 --> 00:54.471
-All right. See you later.
-That's gold. That's it, dude.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.932
-Congratulations, Sam. Well done.
-Thank you, Liza.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.058
See you later.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.336
Well done, matey.

01:35.846 --> 01:36.930
Wish me luck.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.576
Watch out!

02:24.478 --> 02:26.355
I can't believe it's happening.

02:26.438 --> 02:28.273
The whole idea of it has got me
going like…

02:28.357 --> 02:30.359
Oh, stop. You getting all…

02:31.443 --> 02:34.071
is just fear getting in the way
of what you deserve.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.073
Are you making fun of me with my…

02:36.823 --> 02:37.866
Of course not.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.869
It's just, you went…
And I thought I can't improve on that.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.287
I'm just gonna have to replicate it.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.331
Thank you.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.542
Bing-bong, you ding-dongs.

02:46.625 --> 02:47.918
-Ted.
-Yeah?

02:48.001 --> 02:51.839
Guess who is going to be featured
in Vanity Fair's business issue

02:51.922 --> 02:53.465
as a powerful woman on the rise.

02:53.549 --> 02:55.509
I finally got it? This is incredible!

02:55.592 --> 02:57.010
-Ted.
-Yeah?

02:57.094 --> 02:58.762
Not you. Keeley.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.848
Oh, that makes more sense.
Hey, congrats, Keeley.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.516
That's gonna be a Vanity Fair to remember.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.853
Oh, it's just an honor
to be mad fit and successful.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.354
Yeah.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.193
So, ladies, I'm here
both to give and receive.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.945
Dr. Sharon's last day is tomorrow,

03:15.028 --> 03:16.363
and we're all chipping in
to get her something special.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.907
-What did you decide on?
-An envelope of cash.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.077
You know, I figured she already has
all our deep, dark secrets.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.788
Kinda tough to top that
with a scarf and a candle, you know?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.206
Right.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.292
-Yeah. Whatever you got.
-Let's see.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.877
Oh, you know what? Here you go.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.253
Lovely. Thank you.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.505
Yeah.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.340
Yeah. It all spends the same.

03:35.424 --> 03:36.675
All right. Appreciate you.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.135
-Hello, people.
-Higgins!

03:38.218 --> 03:39.052
Leslie.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.014
I just received an email from Edwin Akufo,

03:42.097 --> 03:45.434
and he wants to speak with you, Rebecca.

03:45.517 --> 03:46.810
Okay.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.895
Who is Edwin Akufo?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.815
His father owns
the largest tech firm in Ghana.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.275
Wait a second. I thought I did.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.526
Until he died last month.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.777
I apologize for my joke.

03:56.361 --> 04:00.991
Edwin just inherited £1.2 billion
and loves football.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.535
And?

04:04.119 --> 04:06.955
And I think he wants to buy the club.

04:13.837 --> 04:18.175
Hi. Got the suit Ted bought you
back from the dry cleaners.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.468
Oh, it's my suit.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.470
The second Ted gave it to me,

04:21.553 --> 04:23.639
ownership transferred,
and it became my suit, Will.

04:24.598 --> 04:25.599
Right.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.272
Oi, are my eyebrows crazy?

04:34.733 --> 04:36.860
I've gotta do a photo shoot
with Keeley tonight,

04:36.944 --> 04:40.739
and the photo shoot coordinator told me
my eyebrows are crazy.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.700
Jesus, are my eyebrows crazy?

04:43.784 --> 04:46.995
They wanna do a "at home
with the footballer boyfriend" shot.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.373
Bet they won't even use it.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.085
She also told me I've gotta wear all black
so that Keeley pops.

04:53.168 --> 04:55.379
-You're always wearing black.
-This isn't black.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.964
This is dark heather charcoal.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.466
I love hearing fellas debate fashion.
Who's winning?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.511
Oh, Ted,
can I run a new tactic by you?

05:02.594 --> 05:05.055
Yeah, you can run it, walk it,
cartwheel it to me. I don't care.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.765
Call me Dumbo, 'cause I'm all ears.

05:06.849 --> 05:08.267
-Is that a yes?
-Yes.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.937
Okay. When we play Brentford,
we should play with a false nine.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.648
-Couldn't agree more. What is that?
-Play without strikers.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.775
Okay.
Wait, so Jamie and Dani ain't gonna play?

05:16.859 --> 05:19.903
They do, but they play in midfield
where no one expects them to be.

05:19.987 --> 05:20.988
-Yeah.
-I see.

05:21.071 --> 05:23.574
Okay, so we got both our aces
tucked up our sleeves, huh?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.701
Love that. That's fun.

05:25.784 --> 05:28.453
Okay, today let's go ahead
and try out your fake nine.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.497
False nine.

05:30.581 --> 05:32.207
-Hey, this looks very nice.
-Thank you.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.251
Here we go again.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.671
Give Ted yet another idea
he'll take all the credit for.

05:39.882 --> 05:40.883
That's the job, son.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.760
Do you guys ever wanna be in charge?

05:43.844 --> 05:45.053
Be the boss?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.430
Get all the credit?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.563
You know, we used to believe that
trees competed with each other for light.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.607
Suzanne Simard's field work
challenged that perception,

05:56.690 --> 05:59.651
and we now realize that
the forest is a socialist community.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.446
Trees work in harmony
to share the sunlight.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.532
Can't you just give me
a straight answer for once?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.159
I think he just did.

06:09.161 --> 06:12.206
Right. When this works, which it will,

06:12.289 --> 06:14.958
I'm telling everyone it was my idea,
which it was.

06:18.629 --> 06:20.005
Your eyebrows aren't crazy.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.131
Thank you.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.424
They're psychotic.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.926
I appreciate that.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.640
They can't maintain their lines.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.644
-These guys are just not in sync.
-It's okay.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.854
Oh, hell no. No, no. Hey, hey.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.815
No. No, no. Guys, come on.
That ain't gonna cut it.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.360
Y'all gotta be together on this,
all right? It's like this.

06:41.443 --> 06:45.405
You may hate me,
but it ain't no lie. Yeah?

06:45.489 --> 06:48.325
Then the hands. Bye, bye, bye. All right?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.827
And watch my jumps. Ain't no lie.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.704
See how I'm jumping?
Like I'm a marionette.

06:52.788 --> 06:55.916
That's why this song is on the album
No Strings Attached, all right?

06:56.542 --> 06:58.210
Yes. Okay, good.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.587
Now, look, fellas, performing this
at Doc's going-away party

07:00.671 --> 07:02.506
ain't gonna mean Bo Jackson diddly squat

07:02.589 --> 07:04.716
unless she can tell
how hard we worked on it.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.343
You know what I mean?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.971
It ain't the execution.
That ain't the gift. It's the effort.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.390
Yeah? Okay? You see what I mean?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.520
Uh-oh.

07:47.759 --> 07:48.760
Okay.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.973
Okay.

07:58.937 --> 08:00.355
My most sincere apologies.

08:00.439 --> 08:02.232
I was told your training
would be finished by now.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.902
Oh, that's okay. Hakuna matata, right?

08:06.069 --> 08:08.322
Oh, I'm sorry.
That was kind of racist, wasn't it?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.366
Oh, you know,
Timon and Pumbaa are cartoons.

08:11.450 --> 08:13.410
-So I'll let it slide.
-Hey, I appreciate you.

08:14.661 --> 08:15.829
So, you must be Edwin Akufo, huh?

08:15.913 --> 08:16.872
-Yeah, I am.
-I'm Ted Lasso.

08:16.955 --> 08:18.498
I don't shake hands.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.210
But I have someone who does. Francis.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.377
-Oh. Hi.
-Yes.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.177
That is one of the best handshakes
I've ever hand shook right there.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.889
Firm yet comforting, you know,
like a weighted blanket for my hand toes.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.183
So, I bet you're looking to chop it up
with Miss Welton, yeah?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.392
If that's not impossible.

08:37.476 --> 08:40.812
Well, you say impossible,
but all I hear is "I'm possible."

08:43.357 --> 08:44.650
Makes more sense when written down.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.817
-Okay.
-Yeah.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.611
-Right this way, fellas.
-Thank you.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.489
-Take it from here?
-If it's gotta be me.

08:51.698 --> 08:54.701
Okay, Greyhounds,
now let's get in formation!

08:55.494 --> 08:57.037
Will, here we go!

08:59.915 --> 09:02.334
Five, six, seven, eight.

09:04.294 --> 09:05.295
Come on.

09:06.421 --> 09:07.422
Good.

09:10.342 --> 09:11.593
Hit this.

09:20.519 --> 09:21.520
That was it!

09:30.571 --> 09:31.905
Yes!

09:31.989 --> 09:35.158
I cannot tell you how much I admire
what your club has done this season.

09:35.242 --> 09:37.494
Relegation destroys some teams,

09:37.578 --> 09:39.496
but it's only seemed to
have made yours stronger.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.749
That's all 'cause of the boss right here.
Trickle-down economics may stink,

09:42.833 --> 09:44.877
but trickle-down support
smells like pizza,

09:44.960 --> 09:46.420
roses and, I assume, Viola Davis.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.882
I do care about this club, Mr. Akufo.

09:49.965 --> 09:50.966
Very much.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.759
That's why I'll cut straight to the point

09:52.843 --> 09:54.511
and tell you that
I'm not interested in selling.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.805
Oh, I'm not trying to buy your club.

09:58.015 --> 10:00.058
I'm interested in buying
one of your players.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.561
Sam Obisanya.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.856
But Rebecca loves Sam.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.150
Yeah, we all love Sam.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.359
Exactly.

10:09.985 --> 10:13.780
Also, Sam is under contract
with us for another three years.

10:13.864 --> 10:15.157
Yes, I understand.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.659
Therefore, I would offer you
a generous transfer fee

10:17.743 --> 10:19.995
of so much money
that people would think I'm crazy,

10:20.078 --> 10:21.914
and you've taken advantage of me,

10:21.997 --> 10:23.957
in a financial, non-sexual way, of course.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.920
I believe he's making you
an offer you can't refuse.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.296
Oh, Godfather, I see you.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.258
Well, I'm refusing an offer he can't make.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.345
Is that a quote from the third movie?

10:37.262 --> 10:38.764
I just have one question.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.599
What club is it that you actually own?

10:40.682 --> 10:41.767
Oh, I don't.

10:42.351 --> 10:44.144
At least, not one I can talk about yet.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.230
But it is a team in Africa,

10:46.313 --> 10:49.525
and I figured that Sam might appreciate
the opportunity to play near his family.

10:49.608 --> 10:50.859
You know, his home.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.823
Well, gosh dang it.
Now I wish we had two Sams, you know?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.368
One for y'all and one for us.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.328
Where are we at with cloning these days,
by the way?

11:02.287 --> 11:04.414
Them Scottish folks have been
mighty quiet on that front for a while,

11:04.498 --> 11:05.832
which means we gotta be close, right?

11:05.916 --> 11:09.086
Yeah, well, like my father used to say,
a sad white man is still a white man.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.254
Word.

11:11.964 --> 11:14.883
All I'm asking is for
an opportunity to speak to Sam.

11:14.967 --> 11:16.718
Maybe let him decide for himself, yes?

11:17.302 --> 11:18.303
Yes.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.933
Oh, I hope I'm not interrupting.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.351
Perfect timing.

11:25.018 --> 11:28.063
Sam, this is Edwin Akufo.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.025
Oh, he doesn't like to shake--

11:36.280 --> 11:38.490
Mr. Akufo would like to speak with you.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.618
I figure we could
maybe go to a museum,

11:41.702 --> 11:43.203
have something to eat.

11:44.246 --> 11:45.247
Sure.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.332
Wonderful. After you.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.667
Okay.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.088
It's lovely to meet you all.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.673
-Bye.
-You too.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.429
So strange.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.015
I once wrote a play about a billionaire

12:03.098 --> 12:06.185
who took a footballer
to a museum and then dinner.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.396
What happens in the play?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.772
Well, they get their meal for free

12:10.856 --> 12:13.275
because they found
a little bit of glass in the pasta.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.946
God, I wish I could write fiction.

12:18.030 --> 12:22.159
Oh, thank you, Keeley.
You know, I should revisit that work.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.243
Yeah.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.958
Hi. No.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.461
Sorry. You got me.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.379
Wow, I didn't expect you to be here.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.631
No, me neither.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.799
What can I do for you?

12:37.883 --> 12:41.887
Well, I just wondered if you'd mind
helping me pick out a fancy suit?

12:42.846 --> 12:45.849
Abso-fucking-lutely.
Perfect timing, actually.

12:45.933 --> 12:48.268
I've gotta pick up some outfits
for this photo shoot I'm doing.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.436
Come with.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.355
-What, now?
-Now.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.440
Let's go kill two birds with one stone.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.653
All right, yeah. Let's go…
murder some birds with a rock.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.280
That was good.

13:00.364 --> 13:01.615
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

13:01.698 --> 13:03.825
-I got attacked by a bird once.
-Did you?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.881
Young man, I think you're late for class

13:18.465 --> 13:20.843
by about 25 years.

13:25.931 --> 13:27.266
Would you like a lollipop?

13:27.933 --> 13:28.934
No.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.983
It's Coach Kent, which can only mean

13:36.066 --> 13:39.069
nobody told him it's a half-day
and Phoebe's mom picked her up hours ago.

13:39.695 --> 13:40.988
Fu…

13:42.781 --> 13:43.991
…n.

13:44.700 --> 13:45.826
That's fun, innit?

13:47.619 --> 13:49.371
Okay. See you later.

13:54.793 --> 13:56.920
I always thought this was
what the teachers did when we went home.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.547
Art fundraiser tonight.

13:59.131 --> 14:00.674
For 20 quid, you can buy a kid's art.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.635
For 40, I'll send it home with you
already in a rubbish bin.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.346
That's a solid business model.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.058
Which one of these is Phoebe's?

14:10.976 --> 14:13.020
Oh, I won't be able to display
Phoebe's artwork.

14:13.604 --> 14:14.938
Why not?

14:23.822 --> 14:24.990
Oh, no.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.579
She draws ti--

14:30.662 --> 14:33.999
Unnervingly accurate
charcoal sketches of breasts, yes.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.376
There were more,
but some of the boys stole them

14:36.460 --> 14:37.961
and I think are using them as currency.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.005
Bloody hell.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.926
Nice.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.013
-Do you need a hand?
-Yep.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.026
Unless you need to go.

15:04.238 --> 15:05.322
No, I got time.

15:10.035 --> 15:11.453
It's show-and-tell today.

15:11.537 --> 15:14.498
Should I bring my Jamie Tartt jersey
or my LEGO Hogwarts?

15:15.707 --> 15:17.251
I gotta go with the Jamie Tartt jersey

15:17.334 --> 15:19.419
for fear of how Hogwarts might travel,
you know?

15:19.503 --> 15:21.421
Good thinkin', Abe Lincoln.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.260
Hey, buddy, I gotta let you go, okay?
Have a great day at school. I love you.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.344
Love you.

15:28.512 --> 15:29.596
Hey, boss. What's up?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.307
Right, I'm just gonna come out and say it.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.976
I had a torrid affair with Sam.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.602
Dad, I'm still on.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.355
Hey, sorry about that.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.940
-Okay, I'll talk to you later.
-Bye, Dad.

15:41.900 --> 15:42.901
Yeah.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.154
Okay, so let's see.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.073
-You and--
-Sam.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.783
…uel L. Jackson?

15:49.867 --> 15:52.870
-Obisanya.
-Right, okay. Just checking.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.915
Okay, well, you know,
I think that's great.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.208
Hold on.

15:58.292 --> 15:59.376
Wait. No--

15:59.459 --> 16:00.836
Yes. Yeah, I do. No, I think that's fine.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.506
-I think I need to end it.
-Sure, I can see that.

16:04.590 --> 16:08.260
I asked him for a bit of time
to figure things out.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.470
And now we're in
a bit of a limbo situation.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.890
Great party game,
horrible relationship status.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.642
And then Edwin Akufo swoops in
to take him away,

16:15.726 --> 16:17.728
and I've lost all objectivity.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.648
Sam's a really great player.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.983
One of the best we got.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.819
But do I want him to stay
because of my feelings for him?

16:25.903 --> 16:26.945
Good question.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.908
-We really were great together.
-I mean, come on.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.577
Sam and Rebecca are already
one of my all-time favorite TV couples.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.330
To have one of them in real life?
Yes, please.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.832
But if he wants to go,
I shouldn't stand in his way.

16:38.916 --> 16:40.167
I could not agree more.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.462
But if I let him go,
I might regret it for the rest of my life.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.631
Turns out, I could agree more.

16:50.552 --> 16:51.887
Well, Rebecca.

16:53.055 --> 16:54.056
Listen to me.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.436
Don't listen to me.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.105
Don't listen to Edwin Akufo.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.649
Don't even listen to Sam.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.150
You just listen to your gut, okay?

17:06.902 --> 17:09.570
And on your way down to your gut,
check in with your heart.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.949
Between those two things,
they'll let you know what's what.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.286
They make good harmony,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.789
like two-thirds of Bone Thugs-N-Harmony,
you know what I mean?

17:22.291 --> 17:23.292
Thank you, Ted.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.508
You know, boss, you're starting to develop
a bit of a habit.

17:30.551 --> 17:31.885
-Am I?
-Oh, yeah.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.514
Same time, same place last year,
you dropped another truth bomb on me.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.312
-See you next year.
-I can't wait.

17:56.201 --> 17:59.788
Oh, my God.
That's so good, I can't even look at you.

18:00.539 --> 18:01.582
Thanks, Jacques-o.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.793
Oi, how you doing in there, babe?

18:04.877 --> 18:06.712
God, this place is so posh.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.672
Feel like I'm not supposed to be here.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.340
This place is for rich twats

18:10.424 --> 18:13.093
who piss away all their money
on an outfit they only wear once.

18:14.469 --> 18:17.264
But, Nate,
today you are one of those twats.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.224
I quite like that.

18:19.308 --> 18:21.226
-Oh, this is so much fun.
-Yeah.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.020
Roy never does this stuff with me.

18:23.729 --> 18:26.273
He's always like, "I'm Roy Kent."

18:27.149 --> 18:28.859
"Why do I need to go shopping?

18:28.942 --> 18:31.653
I already own a black T-shirt and jeans."

18:36.200 --> 18:38.619
This is yes.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.330
But I'm worried about the crotch.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.708
Does the crotch feel loose?
The crotch looks loose.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.502
Keeley, thoughts on the crotch?

18:50.672 --> 18:51.798
Oh, my Go--

18:57.221 --> 18:58.764
I think the crotch looks great.

18:59.348 --> 19:00.849
We can have the crotch taken in.

19:00.933 --> 19:04.061
It's better to have a tight crotch
than a loose crotch, you know?

19:04.686 --> 19:06.522
But we love the suit, yes?

19:08.690 --> 19:10.609
I-- What do you think?

19:12.528 --> 19:14.071
No, I don't think this is it.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.365
-No.
-Take it off immediately.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.534
Would you guys like a drink?

19:18.617 --> 19:20.202
Oh, yeah, go on.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.537
Glass of champagne?

19:21.620 --> 19:22.746
I'm all right, thanks.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.499
Oi, it's free.

19:25.582 --> 19:26.667
And…

19:26.750 --> 19:30.337
when you see the prices,
you're gonna wish you'd drank more of it.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.047
Oh, my God. Yeah.

19:32.130 --> 19:34.007
A whiskey, thank you. Please.

19:37.970 --> 19:39.388
Knock knock, Doc Doc.

19:40.764 --> 19:43.350
Oh, please don't tell me
you're taking my office now.

19:43.433 --> 19:44.643
What. No, no. I just came up

19:44.726 --> 19:47.229
to invite Doctor Sharon
to Colin's birthday party tomorrow night.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.024
Colin's birthday is August the 21st.

19:51.108 --> 19:52.609
I love that you know that.

19:52.693 --> 19:54.194
Yeah, I know everybody's birthday.

19:54.278 --> 19:55.529
Really?

19:56.905 --> 19:58.615
-Liam Neeson.
-June 7th.

19:58.699 --> 20:00.534
-Tina Turner.
-November 26th.

20:00.617 --> 20:03.161
Chuck Norris, Sharon Stone,
and Osama Bin Laden.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.706
All March the 10th.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.583
You are good. And you're right.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.377
Colin's party was just a cover story
for Sharon's going-away party.

20:10.460 --> 20:11.420
Not bad, huh?

20:12.337 --> 20:15.632
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
Ted, but Sharon's already gone.

20:15.716 --> 20:19.136
Beg to differ, Higgy Stardust.
Sharon's last day is mañana.

20:19.219 --> 20:22.890
Yes, but an emergency came up,
and she has to leave tonight.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.684
Wait, she left without saying goodbye?

20:27.102 --> 20:29.313
She wrote everybody a letter.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.565
Mine was very nice.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.443
Here's yours.

20:35.986 --> 20:36.987
No.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.825
Don't let her get away with it, Ted!

20:43.702 --> 20:44.745
Yes.

20:49.249 --> 20:51.752
-Wow.
-I know, right?

20:54.046 --> 20:55.130
Kelechi Nwaneri.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.341
Yeah, his work is incredible.

20:57.424 --> 20:59.510
Well, he's Nigerian.

21:01.261 --> 21:02.262
I just bought it.

21:03.472 --> 21:06.266
So I can donate it
to the Cape Coast Castle Museum in Ghana.

21:06.767 --> 21:08.852
This piece belongs in Africa.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.065
It's amazing.

21:13.148 --> 21:14.775
Even for a Nigerian.

21:20.614 --> 21:23.283
Sam, I'm a walking confliction.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.410
I am a billionaire,

21:25.911 --> 21:28.539
yet I don't believe
billionaires should exist.

21:29.706 --> 21:32.709
That's why I'm breaking up
my father's empire.

21:33.210 --> 21:35.337
I'm using the money to make better things

21:36.463 --> 21:38.465
and hopefully make things better.

21:41.760 --> 21:43.470
You are not at all what I expected.

21:44.680 --> 21:46.598
You don't even have a security detail.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.184
Okay.

21:49.268 --> 21:51.770
That's because
I bought out the entire museum

21:51.854 --> 21:53.730
and filled it with actors.

21:57.568 --> 22:01.113
Oh, I thought I recognized him
from I May Destroy You.

22:03.615 --> 22:04.700
Are you hungry?

22:04.783 --> 22:05.784
Starving.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.202
I know a perfect place.

22:07.286 --> 22:09.246
-Edwin.
-It's good to see you.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.373
-This is my friend, Sam.
-Hey, you all right?

22:11.456 --> 22:12.708
Lovely to meet you.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.835
Congratulations.
You both just met a cool person.

22:15.627 --> 22:16.628
Cheers.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.713
See you.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.383
-Pretty cool, eh?
-What?

22:21.466 --> 22:23.302
-That was Banksy.
-Banksy?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.386
Yeah.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.180
-The--
-Yes.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.723
Oh, my God.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.393
Sorry.

22:32.895 --> 22:34.771
Yeah, let's do it. Thanks, babe.

22:37.649 --> 22:38.859
Fuck me!

22:38.942 --> 22:40.444
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.321
You look so hot.

22:42.404 --> 22:43.989
I just wanna fix your tie really quick.

22:44.072 --> 22:45.908
Come here. Okay.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.953
Thank you so much, by the way.

22:50.037 --> 22:51.955
You're so good at everything,

22:52.039 --> 22:55.584
and you're always helping people
and making things better.

22:56.793 --> 22:57.836
Just like you.

23:00.464 --> 23:01.673
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.258
Do you ever--

23:03.342 --> 23:05.302
Do you ever feel like
you wanna be the boss?

23:07.888 --> 23:09.723
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:09.806 --> 23:13.060
I mean, I did used to worry that
I was gonna end up like my mum.

23:14.228 --> 23:16.939
She spent years working
at the same company tirelessly

23:17.022 --> 23:18.774
just for a man to take all the credit.

23:19.525 --> 23:21.276
She wasn't brave enough to dream big.

23:22.027 --> 23:25.364
So, I decided to do things
very differently.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.824
And then I met Rebecca,

23:28.700 --> 23:31.036
and she inspired me to wanna be a boss.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.499
People like you and I,
we can't help but dream big.

23:36.750 --> 23:40.420
And no one is gonna fight harder
for their dreams than us, right?

23:40.504 --> 23:41.505
Right.

23:43.465 --> 23:46.343
The scariest part of all of it is
making the decision to just go for it.

23:46.426 --> 23:49.555
'Cause once you do that,
then everything just sort of falls in--

23:54.101 --> 23:56.478
God. I'm so sorry. I didn't--

23:56.562 --> 23:57.729
-That's okay.
-No, it's not.

23:57.813 --> 24:00.023
-Yes, it is. Don't worry about it.
-No. No, it's fine--

24:00.107 --> 24:01.108
-It was--
-No, it was--

24:01.191 --> 24:03.527
-It happens sometimes to the best of us.
-It's not--

24:04.319 --> 24:05.445
-I just--
-I--

24:05.529 --> 24:06.905
God, I'm gonna get outta this--

24:06.989 --> 24:08.949
-Don't worry about it.
-I do worry about it.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.075
Don't.

24:10.158 --> 24:11.410
Shit.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.476
Is that a younger year?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.769
Nope, same year.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.647
Then why are their pictures shit,

24:40.731 --> 24:43.025
and yours are… not shit?

24:43.942 --> 24:46.278
Well, I take the pictures
before they can fuck them up.

24:46.361 --> 24:48.655
They hate it,
but I know it's for the best.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.700
So you're Ms. Bowen, the mean teacher.

24:53.035 --> 24:54.620
Well, Phoebe likes you.

24:54.703 --> 24:56.788
She's smart. Most of them hate me.

24:56.872 --> 24:59.708
They have, like,
20 different mean nicknames for me.

24:59.791 --> 25:00.834
Go on.

25:00.918 --> 25:02.085
I don't know any of them.

25:05.255 --> 25:09.718
Ms. Bowlegs, Ms. Boring, Ms. Bonehead,
Ms. Bellend, Boaty Ms. Boatface

25:09.801 --> 25:12.804
and then there's one little boy
who simply calls me Fuck-witch,

25:12.888 --> 25:16.308
which is admittedly my favorite.

25:16.391 --> 25:19.770
Well, best teachers are the toughest ones.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.689
My first coach used to
chase me round the pitch on a motorbike

25:22.773 --> 25:24.316
like we were in fucking Mad Max.

25:24.399 --> 25:25.651
That's terrifying.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.528
Yeah, but it made me fast.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.032
The half-hour countdown begins.

25:33.033 --> 25:34.451
Nothing worse than parents' mixers.

25:34.535 --> 25:37.162
They get free chardonnay,
and I get to ward off all the single dads.

25:38.330 --> 25:40.541
-And not-so-single dads.
-Right.

25:40.624 --> 25:41.625
Are you married?

25:42.334 --> 25:43.335
No.

25:56.014 --> 25:58.225
-I've gotta go.
-You're not gonna stay for the art show?

25:58.308 --> 25:59.643
No, sorry.

26:02.563 --> 26:03.939
Thanks for all your help.

26:10.028 --> 26:11.780
Karen, for God's sake, grow the fuck up.

26:19.788 --> 26:22.291
Well, well, well.
Look what the weird bike rode in.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.627
Ted, how long have you
been standing out here?

26:25.711 --> 26:26.879
A long time.

26:26.962 --> 26:28.422
And I really gotta use the john too,

26:28.505 --> 26:31.300
but I'm gonna hold it a bit longer,
'cause I'm so dang ticked off at you.

26:35.179 --> 26:37.306
I was right.
It's a lot easier to navigate that hallway

26:37.389 --> 26:38.557
with this thing all folded up.

26:39.600 --> 26:40.434
Thank you for carrying it up.

26:40.517 --> 26:41.810
How could you just leave?

26:42.936 --> 26:44.563
Sorry, I'm not good with goodbyes.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.024
Well, when I was a baby,
I wasn't good at walking and talking,

26:47.107 --> 26:48.609
but I stuck with it and look at me now.

26:48.692 --> 26:50.402
-Did you get my letter?
-Yes.

26:50.485 --> 26:51.486
-Did you read it?
-No!

26:51.570 --> 26:53.238
We had a whole thing planned for you.

26:53.322 --> 26:55.490
You know how hard it is to get
grown men to learn choreography?

26:55.574 --> 26:58.869
Almost impossible.
Heck, we even got you a gift.

27:01.163 --> 27:02.748
Spoiler alert, it's a bunch of cash.

27:03.332 --> 27:04.541
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

27:05.042 --> 27:06.460
But, Ted, you knew I was leaving.

27:06.543 --> 27:09.129
I did, but I thought I was gonna get
a chance to say goodbye to you.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.549
My wife left me, my dad left me,

27:12.633 --> 27:16.386
and you, more than anyone in the world,
knows how I feel when I get abandoned,

27:16.470 --> 27:17.930
and you just left.

27:18.514 --> 27:20.933
I wrote about that.
It's all in the letter I left for you.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.977
Wait a minute. Okay.
You mean this? This right here?

27:24.061 --> 27:26.897
Guess what. I'm not gonna read
your letter, ever, okay?

27:26.980 --> 27:29.107
You got something to say to me,
just say it to my face.

27:30.526 --> 27:31.985
I thought we had a breakthrough.

27:32.069 --> 27:33.987
You did.
You confronted things you had--

27:34.071 --> 27:36.323
No, no, no. Not me. I'm talking about us.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.826
-We did, Ted.
-Yeah.

27:39.910 --> 27:41.703
Thanks to you, I've learned that

27:41.787 --> 27:45.123
expressing my vulnerabilities can help
my patients with theirs.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.543
You helped me become a better therapist.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.588
And that's saying something,
because I was already fucking brilliant.

27:55.008 --> 27:56.051
That's nice of you to say.

27:57.636 --> 28:00.389
And yet, you were gonna leave
without letting me know any of that.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.225
-Ted, it's all in the letter.
-It's all in the letter!

28:03.308 --> 28:06.603
It's all in your-- Okay, well, fine.
I'll read your stupid-ass letter.

28:06.687 --> 28:07.813
Unbelievable.

28:11.316 --> 28:12.484
You spelled "favorite" wrong.

29:00.157 --> 29:01.325
It's a very good letter.

29:03.702 --> 29:07.080
I feel more comfortable writing goodbye
than saying it. I'm sorry.

29:09.583 --> 29:11.251
It's okay. I understand.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.007
My train to Royston doesn't leave
till midnight.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.759
Wanna grab a drink?

29:21.178 --> 29:22.304
I'm buying.

29:25.182 --> 29:26.558
Yeah, okay. That'd be nice. Yeah.

29:28.393 --> 29:31.271
-But I really gotta pee first. I gotta--
-Door to the left.

29:39.530 --> 29:41.865
I've never had
West African food this good in London.

29:41.949 --> 29:44.117
I can't believe
I didn't know this place existed.

29:44.701 --> 29:45.953
Well, it doesn't.

29:46.453 --> 29:47.788
I had it created for us.

29:48.372 --> 29:49.540
I brought in my own chefs.

29:50.499 --> 29:51.708
I travel often,

29:52.334 --> 29:55.128
and I know what it's like
to miss the food from home.

29:58.340 --> 29:59.550
Actors?

29:59.633 --> 30:00.634
Friends.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.183
Listen. I wanna be honest with you.

30:09.935 --> 30:12.312
I don't see myself leaving
Richmond to play for…

30:12.896 --> 30:15.607
well, whatever team
you end up owning one day.

30:18.443 --> 30:23.407
Sam, you are
the fourth person to know this.

30:24.324 --> 30:26.910
I'm buying Raja Casablanca in Morocco.

30:28.370 --> 30:31.999
My only focus in life will be to make us
one of the biggest clubs in the world.

30:33.417 --> 30:38.172
Bayern, United, PSG, Barcelona…

30:39.965 --> 30:41.133
Casablanca.

30:45.262 --> 30:48.473
The greatest African players
around the world will come home

30:48.557 --> 30:49.641
to play for us.

30:51.059 --> 30:55.731
Mark my words, in 20 years,
an African team will win the World Cup.

30:57.065 --> 31:01.069
Sam, you inspired the world
to care about what's happening at home.

31:02.362 --> 31:04.615
That's why I want you to come play for me.

31:04.698 --> 31:08.619
I want the incredible man you are,
not the footballer.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.289
Although the footballer too is incredible.

31:15.667 --> 31:16.668
Thank you.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.257
I mean…
You've given me a lot to think about.

31:22.925 --> 31:25.093
Please. Take all the time you need.

31:27.137 --> 31:28.972
You have 72 hours.

31:31.808 --> 31:33.852
Hey, please. Finish the jollof. Huh?

31:33.936 --> 31:35.103
I insist.

31:35.687 --> 31:39.274
Thank you. You know, I appreciate
that you had it made the Nigerian way.

31:39.858 --> 31:43.320
Well, I thought you'd prefer it,
even though the Ghanaian way is better.

31:43.403 --> 31:46.198
Oh, I know we've been getting along,
but I will fight you on this one.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.533
Let us fight then.

31:53.205 --> 31:54.706
Oh, wonderful, Mr. Kent.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.417
We've got you upstairs.
You'll start in the black suit,

31:57.501 --> 32:00.921
and then we'd love for Nicky
to take a pass at your eyebrows.

32:08.095 --> 32:09.763
Hey. I'm sorry I'm late.

32:09.847 --> 32:12.641
You're not late, babe.
Your outfit's in the closet.

32:13.392 --> 32:14.601
You look cool as fuck.

32:15.644 --> 32:16.645
Thank you.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.899
How was suit shopping with Nate?

32:20.983 --> 32:22.150
Yeah, it was fine.

32:27.155 --> 32:30.951
I know that you hate this stuff, babe,
but it's gonna be good, yeah?

32:31.034 --> 32:34.621
Please say that it's gonna be good
'cause I'm really losing it.

32:34.705 --> 32:35.998
I'm so nervous.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.961
Babe, you've done a thousand magazines.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.963
You did an advert for a service station

32:43.046 --> 32:46.550
where you jumped out of an airplane
topless eating a hamburger.

32:47.384 --> 32:49.469
You can't be more nervous than that.

32:50.929 --> 32:52.306
But this isn't that.

32:54.099 --> 32:55.642
It was about how I looked.

32:56.476 --> 32:57.936
This is about me.

32:59.479 --> 33:02.107
I had to do an interview,
like a real interview.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.902
They asked me
about my thoughts and my feelings

33:04.985 --> 33:07.279
and my goals for the future.

33:10.073 --> 33:12.492
When people read this article,
they're gonna see me.

33:12.576 --> 33:13.785
See the real me.

33:22.878 --> 33:26.089
The real you is fucking amazing.

33:27.257 --> 33:29.676
And now the whole world
is gonna get to see that.

33:31.011 --> 33:34.097
You are Keeley fucking Jones,

33:34.681 --> 33:36.141
the independent woman.

33:37.434 --> 33:38.977
You're gonna kill it.

33:43.065 --> 33:44.525
So I should keep my top on?

33:45.734 --> 33:46.735
Maybe for one shot.

33:51.323 --> 33:52.658
Thank you.

34:29.319 --> 34:30.529
Hello, Dad.

34:31.572 --> 34:32.614
Yeah.

34:33.991 --> 34:35.199
It was incredible.

34:36.034 --> 34:39.496
Yeah, yeah, he took me to a museum.
And then we had Nigerian food.

34:47.754 --> 34:51.300
Okay, great.
And now look at one another.

34:53.051 --> 34:54.052
Come on then.

35:03.770 --> 35:07.357
That's wonderful.
Can I get the 85, please?

35:08.233 --> 35:10.485
Switching lenses. Will only be a second.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.070
Yeah.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.868
All right, so, earlier
when I was suit shopping with Nate,

35:17.951 --> 35:19.703
there was a little misunderstanding.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.121
He tried to kiss me.

35:21.997 --> 35:23.290
It wasn't a big deal,

35:24.374 --> 35:26.793
but I just thought you should know.

35:26.877 --> 35:29.755
Shit. That must've been awkward.

35:32.007 --> 35:33.175
Thank you for telling me.

35:40.557 --> 35:44.645
I was talking to Phoebe's teacher earlier
for three hours.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.689
And at the end she asked me
if I was married, and I just said no,

35:47.773 --> 35:49.149
nothing else.

35:49.233 --> 35:50.234
I don't know why.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.332
At the funeral,

36:06.458 --> 36:08.585
Jamie told me he still loves me.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.804
Okay. Here we go.

36:23.976 --> 36:25.227
Turn to me.

36:41.285 --> 36:44.121
Well, well, well. Look who knows her way
around a pinball machine, huh?

36:44.204 --> 36:45.998
-I love pinball.
-Yeah.

36:46.081 --> 36:48.709
It's one of the most entertaining
forms of meditation.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.545
Your only opponent is
yourself and gravity.

36:52.504 --> 36:54.756
Yeah, two things we're stuck with.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.426
At least until that Elon Musk fella
stops messing about on Twitter

36:57.509 --> 36:58.802
and starts focusing on jet packs.

37:01.388 --> 37:03.223
"SMF," huh?

37:03.307 --> 37:04.516
Oh, let me guess.

37:06.185 --> 37:07.769
Sharon Mildred Fieldstone?

37:08.353 --> 37:09.479
Sexy motherfucker.

37:10.230 --> 37:12.024
Rest in peace, Mr. Nelson.

37:15.569 --> 37:16.904
-Another round?
-Oh, yeah. Come on.

37:16.987 --> 37:17.988
Come on now.

37:18.488 --> 37:20.616
This one's gonna be on me.
Actually, you know what? No.

37:20.699 --> 37:22.701
Still gonna be on you, Dr. Moneybags.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.829
If you excuse me, I'm gonna go hit
one of my favorite British words,

37:25.913 --> 37:28.624
and my absolute favorite Diamond Phillips,
the loo.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.460
Another two, please, Mae.

37:31.543 --> 37:33.545
-Okey dokey.
-Thank you.

37:36.757 --> 37:38.342
You're the shrink for the team, yeah?

37:40.010 --> 37:41.428
Go on. Ask her.

37:42.012 --> 37:43.013
I'm scared of snakes.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.934
Like, really scared of snakes,
even the tiny ones in my garden.

37:47.434 --> 37:48.602
Does that mean anything?

37:48.685 --> 37:50.437
Do you want it to mean something?

37:51.647 --> 37:54.191
I just don't wanna be afraid
when I'm tending to my tomatoes.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.027
Because the garden is your safe space.

37:59.196 --> 38:00.364
Is it about the snakes,

38:00.447 --> 38:04.034
or is it about the fear and anxiety
slithering into your consciousness?

38:04.743 --> 38:05.744
That's it.

38:05.827 --> 38:07.955
The last one! That's it!

38:08.038 --> 38:09.081
Sorceress.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.167
-I have a recurring dream…
-Oh, God.

38:12.251 --> 38:13.919
…where I'm floating.

38:14.002 --> 38:16.338
Not flying, floating.

38:18.006 --> 38:19.174
Piss off, you three.

38:19.758 --> 38:23.053
You want psychiatric help,
call the number I gave you.

38:24.388 --> 38:25.389
Think about it.

38:25.973 --> 38:26.974
Thanks.

38:28.809 --> 38:30.727
-Thanks, Mae.
-There you go, love.

38:31.436 --> 38:32.646
Oh, no. I ordered two.

38:33.438 --> 38:35.023
Ted asked me to give you this.

38:45.659 --> 38:48.036
Son of a bitch stole my move.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.090
Here's one with no shit in it.

39:01.383 --> 39:02.384
Thanks.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.284
I can't give you an answer about us.

39:30.037 --> 39:33.540
And I know I can't ask you not to go.

39:38.921 --> 39:40.380
But I hope you don't go.

39:44.968 --> 39:46.178
I should go.
