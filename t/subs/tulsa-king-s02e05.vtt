of getting the go-ahead from GM.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.361
So when can we meet the reps?

09:22.362 --> 09:24.130
It's in the process
of being scheduled.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.866
Meantime, there's no harm
in me showing you the ropes.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.367
Oh, shit. I'm all ears, Donnie.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.303
All right. Now,
anyone can sell cars.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.205
There's no secret formula.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.208
What distinguishes a dealership
are two things:

09:36.209 --> 09:38.444
- service and marketing.
- Got you.

09:38.445 --> 09:42.214
For example, a customer comes in
for an oil change,

09:42.215 --> 09:45.918
we wash his car for free,
give him an air freshener.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.420
Doesn't cost a lot,
makes a huge impression.

09:48.421 --> 09:53.159
Exactly. It also creates
a subtle psychological dynamic

09:53.160 --> 09:55.161
where the customer feels
he owes you,

09:55.162 --> 09:57.496
so he becomes loyal to you

09:57.497 --> 09:59.198
no matter how much
you upsell him.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.233
- And marketing?
- That's key.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.704
See, how else can you tell
one dealer from another?

10:04.705 --> 10:07.373
You need an image, a gimmick.

10:07.374 --> 10:11.343
Now, you may not believe this,
but I'm not a real cowboy.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.545
- Get out of town.
- Yeah, seriously.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.414
I've never been on a real horse
in my life.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.249

I'm actually allergic to 'em.

10:17.250 --> 10:19.385
But you got the boots on

10:19.386 --> 10:21.120

10:26.927 --> 10:28.394

10:28.395 --> 10:30.562
what's more wholesome
than a cowboy?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.431
Uh... a baseball player.

10:32.432 --> 10:34.466
