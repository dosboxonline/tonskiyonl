Hey.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.780
Saturday
when the kids were little,

00:30.864 --> 00:33.366

really happened.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.118
We were just laughing

00:35.201 --> 00:37.412

pin the tail on the donkey.

00:37.495 --> 00:40.040
That's the stuff
I'm not ready to let go of yet.

Mm.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.523
(takes deep breath)

01:07.067 --> 01:10.820
Did you know you have
a tiny little scar

01:10.904 --> 01:13.406
-underneath your eyebrow?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.368
Yeah.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.329
I never noticed it before.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.122
Yeah. (inhales deeply)

01:21.206 --> 01:24.417
It comes out
when I'm in the sun,

01:24.501 --> 01:26.461
and I got a little sun
the other day.

01:26.544 --> 01:29.964
I can't believe
I never noticed it.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.011
(clears throat) So...

01:35.095 --> 01:37.013
-when I was a little girl...
-Mm-hmm.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.973
...there was this little
playground right by my house

01:39.057 --> 01:41.685
that my dad would take me to
sometimes,

01:41.768 --> 01:45.480
and it had one of
those really lame slides

01:45.563 --> 01:48.358
<i>-that would give you burn marks</i>
<i>on your butt. Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>-Oh, yeah. Yeah.</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:50.360
And, um, you know,

01:50.443 --> 01:52.529
one of those weird
old rocking horse things

01:52.612 --> 01:54.030
that only had one eye.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.949
<i>The springy ones.</i>

01:56.032 --> 01:57.909
-Yeah, yeah.
-Totally creeped me out.

01:57.992 --> 02:02.622
But then
there was this one swing.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.499
God, I loved that swing.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.004
And he would push me on it.

02:09.087 --> 02:12.424
And one time,
I remember I turned around

02:12.507 --> 02:15.552
on the way back down, and
my dad wasn't paying attention,

02:15.635 --> 02:19.305
and his watch clocked me
right above the eye.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.807
Hmm.

02:20.890 --> 02:22.934
He felt so bad,

02:23.018 --> 02:26.521
but I didn't care because
him pushing me in that swing

02:26.604 --> 02:28.106
was just my favorite thing

02:28.189 --> 02:29.441
<i>in the entire world, you know?</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:32.652
DAVE:
And we swing.

02:32.736 --> 02:36.531
It was such a treat for me,
going there with him.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.868
<i>But I would just-- I'd spend</i>

02:39.951 --> 02:43.955
the entire time
worrying about when...

02:45.790 --> 02:49.002
...he would stop pushing me,

02:49.085 --> 02:51.671
when he'd say
that it was time to go home.

02:55.425 --> 02:58.178
Really wish that I had spent
more time appreciating it

02:58.261 --> 03:00.805

03:00.889 --> 03:03.892
instead of just...

03:03.975 --> 03:06.603
worrying about
when it would end.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.605
Hmm.

on the sit and reach, but...

23:46.384 --> 23:48.678
KEVIN:
You're being really weird, Dad.

23:48.762 --> 23:51.639
Mm-hmm, really weird.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.725
One day you'll get it.

23:55.727 --> 23:57.687
All right, looking good.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.773
Hold on, hold on,
let me have a look at you.

24:03.026 --> 24:06.237
-Yep, still my sons.
-(both laugh)

24:20.460 --> 24:23.713
Just checking in on you.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.591
(sniffles)

24:26.675 --> 24:28.176
Barely slept.

24:28.259 --> 24:30.595
I was up all night
writing a eulogy,

24:30.679 --> 24:33.056
and I can't remember
a single thing that I said.

24:38.853 --> 24:42.023
A depressing notion
for a depressing day-- may I?

24:46.569 --> 24:48.988
It all just feels so...

24:49.072 --> 24:50.907
pointless.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.912
I spent my entire childhood
worrying about losing her.

24:55.995 --> 24:58.498
I spent the past decade

24:58.581 --> 25:00.917
abjectly terrified of it.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.796
And now she's gone.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.216
And yet...

25:08.299 --> 25:10.885
the birds chirp on.

25:12.721 --> 25:14.723
I notice that I'm hungry.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.768
Five minutes ago,
I thought about work.

25:18.852 --> 25:21.146
Tomorrow I'll shower.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.026
It just all feels so pointless.

25:30.739 --> 25:32.741
That too depressing?

25:32.824 --> 25:35.452
Definitely less funny
than your eulogy.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.078
(laughs)

25:41.374 --> 25:42.542
(sniffles)

25:42.625 --> 25:45.170
We'll... give you two a minute.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.639
(sighs)

26:01.269 --> 26:03.897
It's not pointless, Dad.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.527
Hey.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.945
Gonna be a grandfather.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.031
Remember?

26:15.408 --> 26:17.410
A grandfather.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.466
Hey.

26:31.549 --> 26:33.635
We're getting an early start.

26:33.718 --> 26:35.428
Okay.

26:35.512 --> 26:38.390
You keep up with your chess
while I'm gone, do you hear?

26:39.766 --> 26:42.227
-Okay.
-Okay, then.

26:42.310 --> 26:45.146
Go back to sleep.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.998
(exhales)

27:04.082 --> 27:06.042
Grandfather.

27:06.126 --> 27:08.044
Strange word.

27:08.128 --> 27:09.838
Grand. Father.

27:09.921 --> 27:11.423
(exhales)

27:11.506 --> 27:13.508
Never thought of myself
as either, really.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.802
-Well, look at you now.
-Well...

27:15.885 --> 27:17.387
look at me now.

27:19.973 --> 27:22.809
Such a strange relationship:
grandparent.

27:22.892 --> 27:26.146
Not as complicated as parent,
not as fraught.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.398
But it's just...

27:28.481 --> 27:30.483
unconditional.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.194
Easy, pure love.

27:33.278 --> 27:36.322
What an unusual thing.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.783
To love someone
so unconditionally

27:38.867 --> 27:41.494
when you know time
probably won't allow you

27:41.578 --> 27:43.580
to be a big part of their story.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.837
I don't remember
my grandparents.

27:52.589 --> 27:55.508
I can only access
fleeting images.

27:55.592 --> 27:58.219
Smells.

27:58.303 --> 28:00.972
The smell of pies.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.725
She made pies, I think,
my mother's mother.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.687
My father's father
smoked a pipe.

28:07.771 --> 28:10.398
I remember
the smell of that pipe.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.571
Oh, I look
at those two little girls.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.575
I've known them
all of seven months,

28:20.658 --> 28:23.495
and only now
can I even comprehend

28:23.578 --> 28:27.332
how intensely my grandparents
must have loved me.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.920
And all I can remember
are fleeting images.

28:32.003 --> 28:34.923
Smells of pies and pipes.

28:38.593 --> 28:41.471
I wonder what
they'll remember about me.

28:42.555 --> 28:43.723
A lot.

28:43.807 --> 28:46.184
Yeah, a selfish thing
to worry about,

28:46.267 --> 28:48.812
-I know...
-A lot.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.777
Plus you got that really nice,
really distinctive smell.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.696
Well, thank God for that.

28:57.779 --> 29:00.281
Like shaving cream
and old sweaters.

29:00.365 --> 29:02.283
(both laugh)

29:04.869 --> 29:06.913
Okay.

29:06.996 --> 29:09.040
(sighs)

29:09.124 --> 29:10.458
Memphis?

29:10.542 --> 29:11.835
-Memphis.
-All right.

29:12.877 --> 29:15.338
Let's hit the road, Grandpa.

29:19.801 --> 29:21.511
I've been checking
my phone all day.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.179
Hoping I'd receive an email,

29:23.263 --> 29:25.390
so I could tell you something
that would...

29:25.473 --> 29:27.475
maybe make you smile.

29:28.685 --> 29:31.187
Just got the email.

29:31.271 --> 29:33.732
Found out the sex of the baby.

29:37.652 --> 29:39.654
It's a boy.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.825
You're gonna have a grandson.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.662
A boy?

29:47.746 --> 29:49.080
You're sure?

29:49.164 --> 29:50.999
Mm-hmm.

29:51.082 --> 29:53.209
And, um...

29:53.293 --> 29:55.378
if it's okay with you...

29:57.213 --> 30:00.091
...we'd like
to name him William.

30:04.346 --> 30:06.139
Your grandson

30:06.222 --> 30:08.933
is gonna be named
after a man I never met.

30:09.017 --> 30:11.019
But I know him.

30:13.229 --> 30:16.066
'Cause I know you.

30:17.108 --> 30:19.152
It's not pointless.

30:25.283 --> 30:27.285
(sniffles)

30:30.121 --> 30:32.165
A boy?

30:32.248 --> 30:34.626
-Boy.
-Aah! Finally!

30:34.709 --> 30:36.711
(both laugh)

30:38.463 --> 30:41.132
About damn time, man.

30:41.216 --> 30:42.634
We're having a boy!
(laughs)

30:42.717 --> 30:44.719
I'm having a boy, but...

30:44.803 --> 30:46.554
It ain't nothing but women.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.056
All my life,

30:48.139 --> 30:51.351
I got Black women here,
Black women there.

30:51.434 --> 30:53.353
Dej, I love you and you sisters

30:53.436 --> 30:56.106
and your mama,
all the women in my life,

30:56.189 --> 30:59.192
but a little boy...
(laughs)

30:59.275 --> 31:02.320
Little baby boy,
do a little dance.

31:08.118 --> 31:10.286
Aw.

31:11.496 --> 31:13.540
What are you doing?

31:13.623 --> 31:15.834
(both laugh)

31:17.919 --> 31:19.963
Oh, are you planning
on showing off for us?

31:20.046 --> 31:21.047
Yep.

31:21.131 --> 31:22.799
(footfalls thudding)

31:22.882 --> 31:24.926
We have shaven.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.928
Smooth as a baby's bottom.

31:27.012 --> 31:28.847
KEVIN:
Mm-hmm. Hey.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.598
We're supposed to hang it.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.142
You're supposed
to close your eyes.

31:32.225 --> 31:34.394
-KATE: Okay.
-RANDALL: Okay, okay, okay.

31:35.478 --> 31:37.397
-Got the tape.
-(sighs)

31:37.480 --> 31:39.232
REBECCA:
Feeling drowsy today.

31:39.315 --> 31:41.443
-JACK: Yeah, it's a lazy day.
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.

31:44.404 --> 31:47.115
-They're shaving.
-I know.

31:53.038 --> 31:54.998
Do you remember
sitting here a few years ago,

31:55.081 --> 31:56.958
right on this couch?

31:57.042 --> 31:59.044
Mm-hmm.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.964
You turned out to be a ten,
Jack.

32:04.257 --> 32:06.760
I mean, I would go higher,

32:06.843 --> 32:09.846
but I hate when people say
"on a scale of one to ten,"

32:09.929 --> 32:11.598
and then someone answers "12,"
you know?

32:11.681 --> 32:13.808
There are rules.

32:13.892 --> 32:15.310
You're a 12.

32:15.393 --> 32:16.728
Thank you.

32:17.896 --> 32:19.397
I'm glad
that you acknowledged that.

32:19.481 --> 32:20.982
Of course I acknowledge.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.778
JACK: Okay, guys,
what do you say? (clapping)

32:24.861 --> 32:27.405
-Let's get a blindfold on her.
-REBECCA:
All right, Kate, let's...

32:27.489 --> 32:29.366
-Let's do it!
-Spin her around,
see if she's still got it.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.076
-KEVIN: No, no.
-RANDALL:
I don't think she's gonna do it.

32:31.159 --> 32:32.660
-KATE: I think I do.
-REBECCA: I think she does.

32:32.744 --> 32:33.995
KEVIN: Have you been
practicing in your room

32:34.079 --> 32:35.497
-or something?
-REBECCA:
Don't doubt your sister.

32:35.580 --> 32:37.457
RANDALL: It's been a long time,
okay? I agree with Kevin.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.000
-Come on.
-REBECCA: I have faith in her.

32:39.084 --> 32:40.710
Kate has always...

32:40.794 --> 32:42.420
Whoa.

32:42.504 --> 32:44.089
Hey, Bec, look at that.

32:45.882 --> 32:48.343
-Holy cow.
-Is that thing for real?

32:48.426 --> 32:51.054
Hey, guys, look at that, look.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.764
Babe, maybe there's a...

32:52.847 --> 32:55.308
another family out there
just like ours.

32:55.392 --> 32:57.102
(scoffs)
Yeah.

32:57.185 --> 32:58.770
The Peasings.

32:58.853 --> 33:01.231
And they live in...

33:01.314 --> 33:03.775
-Minnesota.
-(laughs)

33:03.858 --> 33:05.777
And they're very happy.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.779
Yeah, they look very happy.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.739
Hey.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.449
Babe.

33:11.533 --> 33:13.743
Jack, when the world puts
something this obvious

33:13.827 --> 33:16.037
in front of you, you don't
just walk away from it.

33:16.121 --> 33:17.872
You could be...

33:17.956 --> 33:20.458
missing out
on something very important.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.585
Okay.

33:22.669 --> 33:25.088
But I don't think
we're gonna use it much.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.340
-Do you want to use this?
<i>-RANDALL:</i>
<i>Um, what am I doing?</i>

33:27.424 --> 33:28.508
-All right, spin.
-What am I doing?

33:28.591 --> 33:30.051
JACK:
Spin her, spin her, spin her.

33:30.135 --> 33:32.012
REBECCA:
Get her nice and dizzy
and disoriented.

33:32.095 --> 33:33.930
JACK:
Oh, no, spin the other way,
spin the other way!

33:34.014 --> 33:35.765
(all shouting, clamoring)

33:35.849 --> 33:37.267
All right, give her the tail,
give her the tail.

33:37.350 --> 33:39.436
JACK: Can't believe
you guys stopped her...

33:39.519 --> 33:41.021
-REBECCA: Jack.
-JACK: What?

33:41.104 --> 33:42.564
No, I moved around the room.

33:42.647 --> 33:44.441
RANDALL:
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.

33:44.524 --> 33:45.859
(all clamoring)

33:45.942 --> 33:47.444
Okay, don't give her any hints,
Randall.

33:47.527 --> 33:48.528
I'm not giving her hints.

33:50.363 --> 33:53.116
There she goes.
(whooping)

33:53.199 --> 33:55.118
Katie girl, no,
are you peeking, what?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.536
-No!
-How do you do that?

33:56.619 --> 33:58.455
Bug, come on, come on,
tell us how you do that.

33:58.538 --> 33:59.914
JACK:
It's crazy.

33:59.998 --> 34:01.791
Before you put the blindfold on,

34:01.875 --> 34:03.626
I look to see
where you guys all are.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.462
And you never shut up.

34:05.545 --> 34:08.465
So as long as I know
where you are,

34:08.548 --> 34:10.550
I always know where I'm going.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.721
Baby girl.

34:20.977 --> 34:22.937
-KATE: Hey.
-Hey.

34:28.526 --> 34:30.528
(Kevin exhales)

34:34.783 --> 34:36.117
KEVIN:
You have
a creepy glow about you.

34:36.201 --> 34:37.410
(laughs)

34:37.494 --> 34:40.163
I got some good news.

34:40.246 --> 34:42.415
I got some very good news

34:42.499 --> 34:44.584
on a very sad day.

34:49.631 --> 34:52.133
(sighs)

34:53.551 --> 34:55.845
We don't have parents anymore.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.931
We still have parents.

34:58.014 --> 35:00.141
You know what I mean, though.

35:00.225 --> 35:02.769
Yeah.

35:02.852 --> 35:04.854
What are we gonna do now?

35:06.940 --> 35:09.025
Like, with our lives?

35:11.820 --> 35:14.406
We're gonna do
what she wanted us to do.

35:14.489 --> 35:16.491
We're gonna live fearlessly.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.495
I'm gonna open up
so many music schools

35:20.578 --> 35:22.163
for the visually impaired
that...

35:22.247 --> 35:24.749
People are gonna start becoming
resentful of blind musicians?

35:24.833 --> 35:26.334
-Exactly.
-Yes.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.461
They're gonna say,
"They have it too good."

35:28.545 --> 35:30.547
(all laugh)

35:32.799 --> 35:35.885
I'm gonna focus
on the nonprofit.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.097
Be home more.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.182
I like my home.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.519
Took me a long time to get it.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.944
DNC wants me to go
to the Iowa state fair.

35:53.028 --> 35:55.822
Shake some hands,
eat some junk food.

35:55.905 --> 35:58.575
Deep-fried Oreos and whatnot.

35:58.658 --> 36:00.660
And, uh...

36:00.744 --> 36:03.705
if the folks who like to
deep-fry their food like you...

36:04.956 --> 36:06.499
...then maybe...

36:08.668 --> 36:10.503
You gonna go?

36:10.587 --> 36:12.380
-I'm weighing it with Beth.
-Mm-hmm.

36:12.464 --> 36:14.257
But, uh, if she's down?

36:16.343 --> 36:18.345
For Mom?

36:19.679 --> 36:22.474
Yeah, for Mom I might go.

36:24.476 --> 36:26.644
(Kate laughs)

36:29.939 --> 36:32.317
Can I tell you guys
my nightmare?

36:35.487 --> 36:37.530
We drift.

36:37.614 --> 36:39.908
With Mom being gone
and our busy lives,

36:39.991 --> 36:41.409
we drift.

36:41.493 --> 36:42.786
And I'm not saying we wind up,

36:42.869 --> 36:44.329
you know,
estranged or anything, but...

36:44.412 --> 36:47.040
We're not gonna drift.

36:47.123 --> 36:49.626
We could drift.

36:58.009 --> 37:00.387
Secret.
(clears throat)

37:00.470 --> 37:03.181
If someone asks me
to close my eyes

37:03.264 --> 37:05.892
and picture my family...

37:05.975 --> 37:08.895
it's not Beth and the girls
I see first.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.440
My first picture is Mom and Dad

37:12.524 --> 37:14.567
and the two of you.

37:16.569 --> 37:19.906
Younger, cuter versions
of you two, but still...

37:20.949 --> 37:23.743
-Same.
-Same.

37:26.996 --> 37:28.998
Guys?

37:31.209 --> 37:33.211
First came?

37:35.672 --> 37:37.465
Me.

37:37.549 --> 37:40.176
-And Dad said?
-Gee.

37:40.260 --> 37:42.595
-And then came?
-Me.

37:42.679 --> 37:44.514
-And Mom said?
-We.

37:44.597 --> 37:46.141
-(chuckles)
-And then came?

37:46.224 --> 37:48.226
Me.

37:49.227 --> 37:50.770
And they said?

37:50.854 --> 37:53.023
That's three.

37:53.106 --> 37:54.941
ALL:
Big Three.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.778
Big Three.

38:04.325 --> 38:06.578
(sighs)

38:09.205 --> 38:11.207
Hey, Kate?

38:13.710 --> 38:16.546
If you drifted...

38:16.629 --> 38:19.049
we'd drift right after you.

38:20.467 --> 38:22.469
Aw.

38:24.596 --> 38:26.348
Can you really drift,
though, Kev?

38:26.431 --> 38:28.016
'Cause I can't remember

38:28.099 --> 38:29.559
if you ever actually
learned how to swim.

38:29.642 --> 38:31.102
(both laugh)

38:31.186 --> 38:33.063
Yeah, well,
I had to learn how to swim.

38:33.146 --> 38:34.856
Growing up with you, all those
tears, I would've drowned.

38:34.939 --> 38:36.983
-Right in the kitchen.
-I'm sorry, I'm just in touch

38:37.067 --> 38:38.735
-with my emotions
unlike some people, Robo-Kev.
-Yeah, I'm just saying,

38:38.818 --> 38:40.987
you know, people don't like
their presidents all weepy

38:41.071 --> 38:43.406
and stuff, you know what I mean,
you got to button that up.

38:47.494 --> 38:50.288
She grabbed my hand.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.374
Hard.

38:52.457 --> 38:54.334
Right at the very end.

38:54.417 --> 38:56.419
You know, right before...

38:57.712 --> 38:59.172
Yeah.

38:59.255 --> 39:01.132
I know, I saw.

39:02.133 --> 39:04.135
I wonder what that was.

39:06.388 --> 39:08.390
(train rattling)

39:15.772 --> 39:17.357
Hey.

39:18.566 --> 39:20.819
Hey.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.866
Mm.

39:32.205 --> 39:34.416
I've missed that little scar.

39:35.583 --> 39:37.627
Come on, you didn't even
notice it for over a decade.

39:37.711 --> 39:41.089
Was too busy looking
at the rest of the face.

39:47.679 --> 39:49.889
I'm scared.

39:49.973 --> 39:52.267
I know.

39:52.350 --> 39:55.103
But don't be.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.024
KEVIN:
Okay.

39:59.107 --> 40:01.026
Let's be honest,
now that I'm shaving,

40:01.109 --> 40:03.069
do I seem more like a man?

40:03.153 --> 40:05.113
-No.
-More like Dad?

40:05.196 --> 40:06.948
-You're getting there.
-I don't know, Kev.

40:07.032 --> 40:08.575
I don't,
I don't really see it yet.

40:08.658 --> 40:11.119
You do know how much
I love you, right, Bec?

40:11.202 --> 40:12.454

40:15.665 --> 40:18.251

the little things, Bec.

40:18.335 --> 40:19.461
Babe, you have said that before.

40:19.544 --> 40:20.795
He was, he was listening
to what I said.

40:20.879 --> 40:22.756
He says it all the time.

40:22.839 --> 40:24.966

I wanted to do with them.

40:40.482 --> 40:42.359
