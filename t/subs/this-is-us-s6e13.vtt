09:07.338 --> 09:08.839
...you know, fugitive lists
or anything like that?

09:08.923 --> 09:11.300
You know, as designated
babysitter for the day,

09:11.384 --> 09:14.011
I just, I'm not gonna
take any crap from the Manny.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.304
-Ah.
-ALL: Ooh!

09:15.388 --> 09:16.472
All right, Senator Pearson,

09:16.556 --> 09:17.807
you better go get your security detail.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.058
Elijah's getting aggressive.

09:19.141 --> 09:21.143
Uh, my daughters
are my detail, so I'm safe.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.646
Okay, you're trusting Annie
to stop a bullet?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.773
This is not Kevin Costner-level security.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.191
She's really fast.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.235
Very funny, Jack.

09:31.237 --> 09:32.989
That's Kevin, Mom.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.491
Dad hasn't been with us
for a while, remember?

09:35.575 --> 09:38.160
-Uh, Randall...
-Why would you say that?

09:38.244 --> 09:41.080
-(shushes)
-No, no, no, no. S...

09:41.163 --> 09:43.374
-W-Why would you say that,
Randall? Seriously.
-I'm right here. I'm right here.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.458
-I'm right here. I'm right here.
-It's not true.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.876
It's okay, I'm right here.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.420
-I'm right here.
-I don't know why he would say that.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.171
RANDALL: Sorry. I'm sorry, Mom.

09:53.467 --> 09:55.136
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Okay, let's burn one on three.

09:55.219 --> 09:58.556
One, two, three.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.391
(camera shutter clicking)

10:02.059 --> 10:03.394
PHOTOGRAPHER: Great.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.479
♪ ♪

10:15.531 --> 10:17.283
Oh, wow. Look at these.

10:17.366 --> 10:18.868
Look at these. We...

10:18.951 --> 10:21.412
are gonna sell these
to help pay for college.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.039
(chuckles) Hey.

10:24.498 --> 10:26.000
You know, I can't remember the last time

10:26.083 --> 10:27.168
I saw you wearing a hat.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.086
Um...

10:29.170 --> 10:30.880
I may have done something...

10:30.963 --> 10:32.548
kind of stupid.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.427
Oh. Wow.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.888
Good wow or bad wow?

10:38.971 --> 10:41.223
It's different. It's different.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.309
I'm, uh... I'm-I'm...

10:43.392 --> 10:44.560
I'm getting my head

10:44.644 --> 10:45.811
-around it.
-Yeah?

10:45.895 --> 10:46.812
Yeah.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.856
KATE: It's all right, Mom.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.024
Hair grows back.

10:50.107 --> 10:53.069
It's not all right. I want old Mom back.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.362
KEVIN: Argh!

10:54.445 --> 10:56.530
Walk the plank!

10:56.614 --> 10:58.699
Wh-What is this?
What is he-what is he doing?

10:58.783 --> 11:00.951
He's playing Captain Hook.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.496
Because he thinks I look like Peter Pan.

11:03.579 --> 11:06.207
(laughing)

11:06.290 --> 11:07.458
(chuckling)

11:07.541 --> 11:09.293
(laughing): Oh, my God. He...

11:09.377 --> 11:12.380
Uh, not funny, pal!

11:12.463 --> 11:13.714
You look at me. Not funny.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.007
No. Give me this.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.218
All three of you, dining table, right now.

11:17.301 --> 11:20.888
We are gonna talk about
how you speak to your mother.

11:25.393 --> 11:28.354
Okay, so that just happened.

11:29.480 --> 11:30.856
It's the new normal.

11:30.940 --> 11:32.692
I'm aware.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.777
-Still, it's...
-Yeah.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.779
She's been calling Kev "Jack" on and off

11:36.862 --> 11:38.447
for the past couple days.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.573
Probably just triggered by, you know,

11:39.657 --> 11:41.659
the shake-up in her routine,

11:41.742 --> 11:42.785
the wedding excitement.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.955
Doctor says we're at the stage where...

11:46.038 --> 11:47.623
you shouldn't correct her.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.041
You know? Just-just roll with it,

11:49.125 --> 11:50.835
you try to distract her
until the episode fades.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.753
Still.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.338
I know.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.095
Maybe Mom shouldn't perform later.

12:02.179 --> 12:03.180
It's a lot of pressure.

12:03.264 --> 12:04.974
Yeah.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.309
Maybe it's too much.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.853
Mm.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.271
Uh... (clears throat) Sorry.

12:10.354 --> 12:11.897
May I interject?

12:11.981 --> 12:13.357
Mm.

12:14.483 --> 12:17.027
Music is good for the soul.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.363
It's-it's been good for her memory,

12:19.447 --> 12:21.991
and, the doctors,
they encourage her to do it.

12:22.074 --> 12:24.243
It's also why we have the most...

12:24.326 --> 12:26.495
bizarre wedding schedule of all time

12:26.579 --> 12:30.082
and why you'll be
sitting in your dress for 12 hours

12:30.166 --> 12:31.959
like a bridal mannequin.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.795
So that Rebecca gets
all the downtime she needs.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.507
Hey.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.301
Once she finds her key,

12:40.384 --> 12:42.011
she'll lock in.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.142
I'm gonna go check on her.

12:48.225 --> 12:50.060
Yeah, I will come with you,

12:50.144 --> 12:51.103
if you don't mind.

12:53.355 --> 12:54.690
Zen Kate.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.401
Your mother can and will do this.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.654
I have no idea if Rebecca can do this.

13:00.738 --> 13:03.741
I mean, th-this unfettered hope
that all will go well

13:03.824 --> 13:05.951
does not come naturally to an Englishman.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.788
-Mm.
-I mean, I-I'm gonna
try my best to keep optimistic

13:08.871 --> 13:10.956
that it'll all be okay, because it will...

13:11.040 --> 13:13.125
crush your sister if it doesn't.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.211
Tell me, um, in the event

13:15.294 --> 13:18.005
that she gets up on that stage
and starts to flounder,

13:18.088 --> 13:20.382
do you have any senatorial powers

13:20.466 --> 13:22.384
to call a citywide blackout?

13:22.468 --> 13:23.594
I do not.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.429
Ah. Worth a try.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.431
(elevator dings)

13:27.515 --> 13:28.766
"You sip your drink,

13:28.849 --> 13:30.184
deepen your breath."

13:30.267 --> 13:32.686
Oh, who writes love letters anymore?

13:32.770 --> 13:35.314
What, is Kevin's hookup
a World War II pilot?

13:35.397 --> 13:38.067
Wait, this totally has
the cadence of a poem.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.860
"With just one glance,

13:39.944 --> 13:41.779
I'd take my chance."

13:41.862 --> 13:43.614
-Yeah, a third grader's poem.
-(hisses)

13:43.697 --> 13:44.949
Yeah, it's not great.

13:45.032 --> 13:46.534
-Okay, then we have...
-(elevator dings)

13:46.617 --> 13:48.285
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Ooh.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.621
-Hey, Kev.
-Hey.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.831
-What's up?
-(hums)

13:51.914 --> 13:53.332
Well, you look fresh and ready.

13:53.415 --> 13:54.917
-Do I?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.418
Relaxing night or not so much?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.170
Well, it was, you know...

13:58.254 --> 13:59.630
Mm.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.466
Yeah, well... (inhales sharply)
I went to bed so early

14:02.550 --> 14:04.718
I feel like I missed out on everything.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.555
Anything, uh, interesting happen?

14:07.638 --> 14:09.181
(sighs) You have no idea.

14:09.265 --> 14:10.558
I feel like I need a nap.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.852
-Huh.
-(elevator dings)

14:12.935 --> 14:14.270
Oh.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.688
-Hey, party people.
-Hey.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.273
You know, this hotel has a sauna.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.316
That's, like, really swanky, right?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.735
-Yeah, it is.
-So swanky.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.362
(quietly): Bet it gets
pretty hot and steamy in there.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.655
Mm-hmm.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.657
(whispering):
Oh. It's getting kind of chilly.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.409
Can I get my wrap from your room?

14:28.492 --> 14:29.910
I think I left it there last night.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.287
The, like, floral wrap thing.

14:31.370 --> 14:32.746
-KEVIN: Yeah. Course.
-Thanks.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.915
(elevator dings)

14:36.250 --> 14:37.877
(doors open)

14:40.880 --> 14:44.925
All right, now listen up.
There is no making fun

14:45.009 --> 14:46.594
of your mother.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.722
If you don't have something
nice to say about her new haircut,

14:49.805 --> 14:51.974
you don't say anything at all.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.643
What about you, Jack? You...

14:54.727 --> 14:57.271
haven't really said anything
about it since you saw it.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.939
I love it.

15:00.190 --> 15:01.275
You look great.

15:01.358 --> 15:02.860
Like a hotter Jamie Lee Curtis.

15:02.943 --> 15:04.904
But why did she cut it?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.365
Well, Randall, uh...

15:08.449 --> 15:09.950
I...

15:10.034 --> 15:13.078
I wanted to try something
more fashion-forward, okay?

15:13.162 --> 15:15.039
And I don't want to talk about it anymore.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.708
(exhales)

15:17.791 --> 15:18.709
(grunts)

15:18.792 --> 15:20.753
What's wrong with Mommy?

15:20.836 --> 15:22.129
She looks like He-Man--

15:22.212 --> 15:23.547
that's what's wrong with her.

15:23.631 --> 15:25.424
(chuckles softly)

15:25.507 --> 15:26.467
Not funny.

15:27.551 --> 15:29.720
-MIGUEL: All right.
-NICKY: Ah.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.097
-Uh-huh. Okay, okay.
-Look at that.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.682
And...

15:33.766 --> 15:35.309
-(Nicky chuckles)
-Mm-hmm.

15:35.392 --> 15:37.269
-Hello!
-(gasps)

15:37.353 --> 15:39.480
-Oh, come on. What is that?
-REBECCA: Oh!

15:39.563 --> 15:42.149
-Oh! -MIGUEL: There is no way.
-Oh, yeah. Uh, what?

15:42.232 --> 15:43.233
-Where'd that come from?
-(chuckles)

15:43.317 --> 15:44.652
-What?
-Are you palming cards?

15:44.735 --> 15:46.070
NICKY: Whoa! I'm a lover,

15:46.153 --> 15:48.864
Miguel, but those are fighting words.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.783
-(laughs)
-I'm coming for you.
-RANDALL: Hey, Mom!

15:50.866 --> 15:52.701
-How you feeling?
-Look at that.
-Hi, sweetheart.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.663
Oh, good, good, good,
if Nicky here would just stop cheating.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.290
-Oh! Et tu, Rebecca?
-MIGUEL: Ooh.
-Honey,

15:58.374 --> 16:00.167
roll up your sleeves
so we aren't tempted to think

16:00.250 --> 16:02.044
-that you're hiding something.
-Hey, just...

16:02.127 --> 16:04.463
-Look, woman. Look at this.
-Oh, he's definitely hiding something.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.173
-Right?
-(chuckling)

16:06.256 --> 16:08.592
Okay. Well, uh...

16:08.676 --> 16:11.261
Hey, should we talk about
that reception performance?

16:11.345 --> 16:13.138
Oh, no, I-I think we have, uh...

16:13.222 --> 16:14.890
We still have plenty of time
before the ceremony.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.102
And, clearly,
this game is over and tainted.

16:18.185 --> 16:21.146
-(sighs)
-Why don't we let Philip
get his mind right for the nuptials

16:21.230 --> 16:23.190
and you and I can
go and do our wine tasting

16:23.273 --> 16:24.358
that we've been talking about.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.693
That way, we can replenish all the wine

16:25.776 --> 16:27.277
that Philip's family drank up last night.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
(chuckles)

16:29.113 --> 16:30.864
Yeah, I don't know if now's the right time

16:30.948 --> 16:33.075
-for a wine tasting, Miguel.
-Sure, it is.

16:33.158 --> 16:34.952
Come on. I insist.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.537
You go ahead, kiddo.

16:36.620 --> 16:37.955
You just leave me with the ladies.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.332
We're gonna play a new cheat-proof game.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.418
Yeah. Keep the optimism afloat.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.128
With a little merlot.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.088
Oh, no, if anybody
orders any merlot, I'm leaving.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.215
I am not drinking any frickin' merlot!

16:49.925 --> 16:52.428
You see the... <i>Sideways.</i>

16:52.511 --> 16:54.096
The movie. It was...

16:54.179 --> 16:56.473
Okay. You know what, let's go.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.226
-(birds chirping)
-(soft chatter)

17:01.729 --> 17:02.980
(swishing) Mmm.

17:03.063 --> 17:05.482
-That is good.
-Mm.

17:08.152 --> 17:10.821
It's one thing to understand
these changes in Mom.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.948
It's another thing to accept 'em.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.366
And accept that even more are coming.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.786
Hey, should we, um,
try this older pinot next?

17:17.870 --> 17:20.205
-Mmm.
-All right. Let's go with that.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.875
Nice color.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.377
What if she starts to think I'm William?

17:26.712 --> 17:28.714
Well, then let's toast

17:28.797 --> 17:30.632
-to your mother not calling you William.
-(sighs)

17:30.716 --> 17:31.884
<i>-Salud.</i>
<i>-Salud.</i>

17:35.596 --> 17:37.264
Mmm. (swishing)

17:37.347 --> 17:39.224
Oh, yeah. I'm getting, um,

17:39.308 --> 17:41.226
-notes of tobacco.
-Mm-hmm.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.644
Uh, is that cherry cola?

17:42.728 --> 17:43.937
-I think so.
-Yeah.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.522
-(sniffing)
-It's nice.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.648
Total Christmas notes.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.067
There's a toasty fireplace,

17:48.150 --> 17:49.526
a-a fresh-cut wreath.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.861
-It's...

24:39.936 --> 24:41.771

-Okay.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.694
together today.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.946
Marriage,

29:42.030 --> 29:44.407
the blessed arrangement.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.785
That dream within a dream.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.453
Oh, good Lord.

29:48.536 --> 29:50.330
(laughs)

29:50.413 --> 29:51.831
Haud yer wheesht!

29:51.915 --> 29:54.542
You're quite the loud bunch, aren't ya?

29:54.626 --> 29:57.086
Or maybe just off your trolleys.
Ah dinnae ken.

29:57.170 --> 29:58.713
(laughs)

29:58.797 --> 30:00.340
Right.

30:00.423 --> 30:02.425
Guess I should've prepared something.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.761
(laughter)

30:04.844 --> 30:06.763
And that kills?

30:06.846 --> 30:08.306
And so, Philip,

30:08.389 --> 30:10.266
welcome to the family, my brother.

30:12.268 --> 30:14.270
Sister.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.440
I love you beyond measure.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.359
WOMAN: Aw.

30:19.442 --> 30:23.196
The two of you have been
very smiley today.

30:23.279 --> 30:26.282
-And I dig that.
-(people chuckling)

30:26.366 --> 30:29.661
-And, Philip, yours is very nice,
-(mouthing)

30:29.744 --> 30:32.747
but my sister's...

30:33.832 --> 30:36.501
...my God, if it's not
the same infectious smile

30:36.584 --> 30:38.628
that she had since we were little kids.

30:39.754 --> 30:42.715
And I'm so happy
that time hasn't changed that.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.427
And I'm really glad
that you broke it back out.

30:49.055 --> 30:51.057
(smacks lips)

30:51.975 --> 30:54.936
I've been thinking a lot today, um...

30:55.019 --> 30:57.730
about time.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.440
And how, when you're young--

30:59.524 --> 31:01.651
like when you're Jackie's age--

31:01.734 --> 31:04.863
a year is like a fifth of your existence.

31:04.946 --> 31:08.199
And so maybe when you're younger,

31:08.283 --> 31:11.411
time seems to move a little bit slower.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.915
Summer vacation is a lifetime.

31:16.958 --> 31:19.085
But the older we get,

31:19.168 --> 31:22.297
the faster time just seems to come at us.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.507
All of us.

31:24.591 --> 31:27.719
You know, the years just keep flying by,

31:27.802 --> 31:30.597
faster and faster.

31:32.181 --> 31:35.310
It can give a guy whiplash,
just thinking about it.

31:39.522 --> 31:42.108
And so while I would love
nothing more than to...

31:42.191 --> 31:45.320
stay in this moment
as long as humanly possible,

31:45.403 --> 31:48.281
to celebrate our favorite newlyweds...

31:48.364 --> 31:50.867
sadly, I have yet to build a remote

31:50.950 --> 31:53.578
that pauses life.

31:53.661 --> 31:56.164
-Damn.
-(laughter)

31:56.247 --> 31:58.291
That doesn't mean there aren't still

31:58.374 --> 32:01.502
summer vacations to be enjoyed.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.839
Still good conversations to be had.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.383
And still love to be shared.

32:09.135 --> 32:12.472
It just all happens much faster.

32:13.848 --> 32:16.184
But, um...

32:16.267 --> 32:18.227
in moments like this,

32:18.311 --> 32:20.813
when you're around
all your favorite people...

32:21.898 --> 32:25.360
...celebrating a really special day...

32:26.527 --> 32:29.072
...time does slow down ever so much.

32:30.865 --> 32:32.909
So I'm grateful to Kate

32:32.992 --> 32:35.203
and Philip for that.

32:38.539 --> 32:41.918
And I'm filled with comfort,
as I look around this room,

32:42.001 --> 32:44.420
knowing that all of you will be on this

32:44.504 --> 32:47.048
speeding train with me,

32:47.131 --> 32:50.134
slowing down
for the occasional special stop.

32:50.218 --> 32:53.930
All the way till the very end.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.683
So, um...

32:56.766 --> 32:58.184
cheers.

32:58.267 --> 33:00.895
-MAN: Cheers.
-WOMAN: Cheers.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.398
(smacks lips)

33:03.481 --> 33:05.400
Okay.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.902
And now to drag us back
from the dark abyss

33:07.986 --> 33:09.737
that I just pushed us all into.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.573
(laughter)

33:12.657 --> 33:14.158
Uh, it is my pleasure to introduce

33:14.242 --> 33:16.619
a very special performance.

33:16.703 --> 33:19.414
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen, I give you

33:19.497 --> 33:21.874
the one, the only...

33:21.958 --> 33:24.127
Mom.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.177
The stage is all yours, Mom.

33:37.056 --> 33:39.308
(whispering indistinctly)

33:58.578 --> 34:00.788
It took me a sec, but I am turning

34:00.872 --> 34:03.041
positive on the mustache.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.084
-Women dig a 'stache.
-(laughs)

34:05.168 --> 34:06.794
And men...

34:06.878 --> 34:10.089
dig a woman who can
pull off a hot, short haircut.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.759
-Oh, thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.011
(chuckles)

34:16.763 --> 34:19.265
I think multiple men
calling me Pound of Ham

34:19.348 --> 34:21.350
really threw me.

34:22.685 --> 34:23.811
I love our routine.

34:24.979 --> 34:26.439
I know.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.609
Still good to shake things up
from time to time though.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.070
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.578
You know something
that Pound of Ham Rebecca

34:40.661 --> 34:42.455
-would never do?
-Hmm?

34:42.538 --> 34:45.083
Strut over to that piano over there
and rip it a new one.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.003
(laughs)

34:50.088 --> 34:51.380
Well...

34:51.464 --> 34:53.841
Pound of Ham Rebecca's dead.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.636
Oh, okay.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.721
(laughs)

35:01.099 --> 35:03.768
(crowd murmuring)

35:03.851 --> 35:06.145
I want you to know...

35:06.229 --> 35:08.523
that if your mother is unable to perform,

35:08.606 --> 35:10.149
I've arranged for me and the band

35:10.233 --> 35:12.151
to immediately start playing

35:12.235 --> 35:14.529
Celine Dion's "My Heart Will Go On."

35:14.612 --> 35:16.197
(both laugh)

35:16.280 --> 35:18.825
-That's right, me on lead vocal.
-Mm-hmm.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.660
Going full <i>Titanic.</i>

35:20.743 --> 35:22.703
All right, it's gonna be a catastrophe

35:22.787 --> 35:24.747
of such epic proportions
that no one's really gonna

35:24.831 --> 35:26.749
remember anything else about this wedding.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.460
-I love you very much.
-Yeah.

35:29.544 --> 35:30.837
It's good to hear, you know?

35:30.920 --> 35:32.088
Considering.
