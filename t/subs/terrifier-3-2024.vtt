01:28.542 --> 01:30.250
What's wrong?

01:30.375 --> 01:32.500
There's someone on the roof.

01:33.375 --> 01:35.500
Jules!
Baby, are you sleepwalking?

01:35.542 --> 01:36.918
Listen.

01:42.876 --> 01:44.125
I don't hear anything.

I don't know, she said she heard something on the roof.

01:49.876 --> 01:51.626
There were footsteps.

MARK:
Can you take care of this,
please?

01:58.876 --> 02:01.292
I gotta be up in three hours.

Come on, Jules,
let's get back into bed.

02:06.375 --> 02:08.626
No more sugar after dinner,
okay?

02:08.667 --> 02:11.250
Too many bad dreams
and not enough sleep.

02:11.375 --> 02:12.167
But mom!

02:12.250 --> 02:13.876
I didn't have a bad dream.

02:13.918 --> 02:15.542
I really heard someone
on the roof!

02:15.626 --> 02:16.167
Shh.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.125
Keep your voice down.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.042
Don't wake up your brother.

02:19.125 --> 02:21.125
Nobody believes me.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.751
Jules, it's probably just
the house settling.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.042
Or an animal.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.626
You know, sometimes a raccoon
or squirrel can get up there.

02:27.667 --> 02:28.542
It was Santa.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.292
I'm positive.

02:33.667 --> 02:36.000

it was?

02:37.542 --> 02:39.167

One of Santa's elves.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.125
An elf?

02:40.250 --> 02:41.626
JENNIFER:
Mhm.

02:41.667 --> 02:44.250
Sometimes Santa sends a scout
a few days before Christmas Eve

02:44.292 --> 02:46.000
to make sure our house meets
all the necessary

02:46.125 --> 02:47.542
safety requirements.

02:47.626 --> 02:48.751
Like what?

02:48.792 --> 02:50.626
Like making sure the roof
is sturdy enough

02:50.667 --> 02:52.751
to hold all the reindeer,
for one thing.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.042
Can't have them crashing
through the ceiling,

pooping on everything.

(BOTH GIGGLE)

02:57.542 --> 02:58.751
What else?

02:58.876 --> 03:00.667
They have to measure the chimney
to make sure it's wide enough

03:00.751 --> 03:03.292
to fit Santa's big fat belly.

03:03.375 --> 03:06.167
Sometimes he splurges
too much during the holidays.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.876
Just like daddy?

03:07.918 --> 03:09.417
Just like daddy.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.667
Can we leave some milk
and cookies out for the elves?

03:12.751 --> 03:14.375
If you go to sleep right now,

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
I'll go downstairs
and leave them a plate.

03:16.626 --> 03:17.626
Okay?

04:03.626 --> 04:05.250
(EXHALES)

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
You forgot to lock
the front door again.

04:09.751 --> 04:10.751
Perhaps you could have
a little concern

04:10.792 --> 04:12.626
for your family's safety?

04:15.751 --> 04:17.500
By the way, your daughter left
a glass of milk and cookies

04:17.626 --> 04:19.417
for Santa's elves
in the kitchen.

04:20.292 --> 04:22.626
Can you make sure to eat them before she gets up for school?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.000
Hello?

04:26.417 --> 04:28.375

04:30.125 --> 04:32.500

How was the trip?

25:21.626 --> 25:22.042
Fine.

25:22.125 --> 25:23.500
Wanna see your room?

25:23.626 --> 25:24.125
Go ahead.

25:24.167 --> 25:25.751
We'll catch up later.

25:25.876 --> 25:26.417
Yeah. All right.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.000
I'll see you guys later.

25:29.542 --> 25:31.626

-SIENNA: Yes.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.417
Oh my God.

25:48.542 --> 25:51.125
It looks like a fairy tale
exploded in here.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.292
GABBIE:
Do you like it?

25:52.375 --> 25:55.876
Me and mommy redecorated,
but I picked out most of it.

25:55.918 --> 25:58.375
I know how much you like
dragons and wizards.

25:59.417 --> 26:00.626
I love it.

26:01.876 --> 26:03.250
Really?

26:03.292 --> 26:04.000
Yes, really.

26:04.042 --> 26:05.250
This is the coolest room ever.

26:05.375 --> 26:06.542
Are you kidding?

26:06.626 --> 26:09.500
I don't know what to say,
this is beautiful.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.125
Made this for you too.

26:12.667 --> 26:14.125
Gabs.

26:18.042 --> 26:22.375
'To Sienna, my big sister
from another mister.

26:23.167 --> 26:24.417
I've missed you more than ever.

26:24.500 --> 26:27.000
And getting into trouble
hasn't been nearly as much fun

26:27.042 --> 26:28.751
without you.

26:28.792 --> 26:31.042
Looking forward
to the best Christmas ever,

26:31.125 --> 26:34.250
filled with fun,
smiles, and laughter.

26:34.292 --> 26:35.500
Love, Gabby.

26:36.876 --> 26:40.000
P.S. We still haven't made it
to the moon.'

26:42.876 --> 26:44.375

26:48.125 --> 26:49.626

26:50.417 --> 26:52.250

DENNIS:
I just hate places like this.

27:42.375 --> 27:44.375
It's like they got a soul
and they're pissed that

27:44.500 --> 27:46.000
-we're tearing 'em apart.
-Oh, shit.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.751
Please don't tell me
you believe all the stories

27:47.792 --> 27:49.000
about this place.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.500
What stories?

27:51.626 --> 27:53.876
Back in the early 90s,

27:54.000 --> 27:58.375
some maniac abducted
and killed over a dozen kids

27:58.417 --> 28:00.125
in this town.

28:00.167 --> 28:01.792
They buried all the bodies
in the basement here

28:01.876 --> 28:03.375
in this building.

28:04.042 --> 28:06.918
Now everyone swears
the place is haunted.

28:16.751 --> 28:18.500
Are you fucking with me?

28:21.125 --> 28:22.876
You're fucking with me.

So, what do you think?

29:17.876 --> 29:20.000
More Blaster Man?

29:20.918 --> 29:23.250
What's the matter
with Blaster Man?

29:23.292 --> 29:24.626
I thought you liked him.

29:24.751 --> 29:26.375
You only draw boys.

29:26.500 --> 29:28.500
Boys, boys, boys.

29:28.542 --> 29:29.918
That's not true.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.876
I draw girls all the ti--
that is a girl right there.

29:31.918 --> 29:33.500
Look at that.

29:33.542 --> 29:34.751
That is a girl.

29:34.792 --> 29:37.626
But she's not a superhero.

29:37.751 --> 29:39.751
Last time you said
you were going to draw a girl

29:39.792 --> 29:41.876
that could beat up Blaster Man.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.167
Remember?

29:44.500 --> 29:46.542
You pinky swore!

29:46.626 --> 29:48.000
That's sacred.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.876
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.000
I will tell you what, though.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.751
As soon as I'm finished
with this comic,

29:54.792 --> 29:56.292
I'm gonna make you
something really special.

29:56.375 --> 29:58.000
How's that? Okay?

29:58.042 --> 29:59.667
Yeah, yeah.

29:59.751 --> 30:01.250

30:16.375 --> 30:18.375
I do have something for you.

30:26.626 --> 30:28.542

in the clown cafÃ©,

30:43.125 --> 30:44.667
It's for my eyes only.

30:44.751 --> 30:45.918
Got it?

30:46.000 --> 30:47.167
Got it.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.500
What's the clown cafÃ©?

30:51.125 --> 30:52.751
It's a bad place.

30:52.792 --> 30:55.667
A place I don't want
to think about.

30:55.751 --> 30:58.125
Happy thoughts
from now on. Okay?

30:58.250 --> 30:59.417
Okay.

wouldn't feel bad.

Okay, wow.

39:26.292 --> 39:27.626
Thanks for knocking, Shaw.

39:27.751 --> 39:28.792
Sorry.

39:29.167 --> 39:30.000

Uh, Shaw, this is,
um, Mia.

39:36.751 --> 39:37.876
Hi.

39:37.918 --> 39:39.626
She's a really big fan
of yours.

39:39.667 --> 39:41.125
I'm not a fan, you asshole.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.125
(CHUCKLES)

39:42.250 --> 39:43.876
She's obsessed
with the Miles County Clown.

39:43.918 --> 39:46.375
Like all that true crime shit.

39:46.417 --> 39:48.000
She thinks
you're a celebrity, dude.

39:48.125 --> 39:49.042
Don't listen to him.

39:49.125 --> 39:50.626
Like, literally, ever.

39:50.751 --> 39:52.250
Um, hi.

39:52.292 --> 39:54.375
It is so nice to meet you.

39:54.876 --> 39:56.000
Hi.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.500
I seriously know,
like, everything about you.

40:00.626 --> 40:03.125
Everything online at least,
um, I've been following you

40:03.167 --> 40:04.250
for years.

40:04.292 --> 40:05.751
Dude, you're a legend.

40:05.876 --> 40:07.250
You survived Art the Clown,

40:07.375 --> 40:10.000
See? Fucking fangirl.

40:11.751 --> 40:13.500

40:15.375 --> 40:17.000
Um, listen, I actually
had a little bit of a favor

40:17.125 --> 40:18.250
that I wanted to ask you.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.542
You see, my roommate and I,
we have a true crime podcast.

40:20.626 --> 40:21.792
It's called Graven Image.

40:21.876 --> 40:23.250
And our Miles County Massacre
episodes?

40:23.375 --> 40:25.250
They get our biggest hits
by far.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.250
So I was wondering
if maybe you'd be willing

40:27.292 --> 40:28.626
to come on as a guest sometime?

40:28.751 --> 40:30.250
I seriously would be so honored.

40:30.375 --> 40:33.250
I don't really do
things like that.

40:33.375 --> 40:36.125
Jesus, do you really think
he wants to dredge up

40:36.250 --> 40:38.000
the worst experience
of his life?

Okay, well, I get that,
but I just--

40:42.876 --> 40:46.000
I think a lot of people would
really like to hear from you

Makeup?

59:05.250 --> 59:06.042
Yeah.

59:06.125 --> 59:08.250
Are you old enough for makeup?

59:08.292 --> 59:09.626
Okay. Thank you.

Next.

59:16.876 --> 59:17.918

Hmm.

59:20.375 --> 59:21.500
Not sure.

59:21.542 --> 59:23.876
I don't think Jonathan
is really into black anymore.

59:24.417 --> 59:26.000
Jonathan doesn't wear black?

59:26.125 --> 59:27.500
Mr. Death Metal?

59:27.542 --> 59:29.876
I don't think he listens
to that anymore either.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.626
Just a phase, I guess.

59:33.918 --> 59:38.292
All right, well, then,
what does he wear now?

59:38.375 --> 59:39.542

I don't know.

59:40.792 --> 59:42.250

all over my body,

01:59:44.626 --> 01:59:47.500
(DOOR OPENS)

01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:54.918
(DOOR CLOSES)

02:00:27.626 --> 02:00:29.167
BUS DRIVER:
You ok hun?

02:00:39.542 --> 02:00:40.751
(HONKS)

02:00:42.918 --> 02:00:45.375
It's a Terrifier Christmas

02:00:45.417 --> 02:00:48.125
Let the horror
fill your heart

02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:50.667
Do you hear footsteps,
that's not Santa

02:00:50.751 --> 02:00:53.542
It's a jolly clown named Art

02:00:53.626 --> 02:00:56.125
He is a Miles County legend

02:00:56.167 --> 02:00:58.876
With a smile that brings
on chill

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.250
On a journey
to outdo himself

02:01:01.375 --> 02:01:04.000
Let's talk his latest kill

02:01:04.125 --> 02:01:06.751
[indistinct lyric]

02:01:06.792 --> 02:01:09.375
We saw your gleaming eyes

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:12.125
He'll kill the flesh right
off your bones

02:01:12.167 --> 02:01:14.876
And shock with
a silent laugh

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.876
It's a Terrifier Christmas

02:01:20.751 --> 02:01:24.500
Tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta-tum-ta
