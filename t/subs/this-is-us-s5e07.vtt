<i>MIGUEL: Well, how do you feel</i>

11:51.544 --> 11:54.547
Well, at this point, I'll cut my legs off.

11:54.631 --> 11:56.675
Just get me on the next flight to L.A.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.724
Great! Thank God.
What time?

12:04.808 --> 12:06.351
Oh, wait. No, sorry. I...

12:06.434 --> 12:09.562
I-I put in the code
for Victorville, not Vancouver.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.481
<i>There are a lot of flights</i>
<i>from Victorville, though.</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:13.692
Yeah, but I said...
I'm not in Victorville, Mom.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.819
Why didn't the movie give you an assistant

12:15.902 --> 12:17.737
to do these kind of things?

12:17.821 --> 12:19.531
You know, it's-it's an indie film.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.074
It's a smaller budget, and I-I told them

12:21.157 --> 12:23.743
I'd take one for the team and...
and go without,

12:23.827 --> 12:25.286
-which I am deeply regretting at the moment.
-(tires squealing)

12:25.370 --> 12:26.955
-Geez!
-(honking horn)

12:28.039 --> 12:30.291

12:46.766 --> 12:49.144
Okay, great.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.520
I j... I...
Sorry, I got to take this.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.022
My agent won't stop hounding me.

-Hello?
<i>-AGENT: Please tell me</i>

12:54.524 --> 12:56.526

How's it going?

13:19.966 --> 13:21.509
<i>MADISON:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

13:21.593 --> 13:24.721
I'm here.
I'm, uh, I'm waiting for a room.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.848
I'm not in active labor,

13:26.931 --> 13:29.100
so nobody seems to be in a rush to see me.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.977
But what about your private room?

13:31.061 --> 13:32.270
You're supposed to have a private room.

13:32.354 --> 13:33.855
<i>They're trying to find one.</i>

13:33.938 --> 13:35.690
I'm six weeks before my due date.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.234
-Nobody was expecting me.
<i>-No, no, no.</i>

13:38.318 --> 13:40.320
No, no, no.
Th-They said that the room would be ready

13:40.403 --> 13:41.780
when-when you're in labor.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.448
And you're in labor,
so the room should be ready,

13:43.531 --> 13:45.575
right?
I'll handle this.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.244
-Kevin, it's okay.
<i>-No. No, it's not okay.</i>

13:48.328 --> 13:49.496
You should have a private room.
I got a card

13:49.579 --> 13:50.622
right here from the hospital

13:50.705 --> 13:52.624
with a direct line I'm supposed to call

13:52.707 --> 13:54.542

I'm gonna call right now,

13:54.626 --> 13:55.919

14:03.760 --> 14:05.553
I'm, uh...

14:05.637 --> 14:07.222
I'm on my way to the airport.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.057
Miguel and my mom
are trying to book me a flight.

14:09.140 --> 14:11.476
So, hopefully,
I'll be there in the next couple hours.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.229
Okay.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.732
I'm coming.
I promise.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.194

14:21.277 --> 14:23.697
Okay.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.009
A long story.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.177

14:46.261 --> 14:47.804

16:14.849 --> 16:16.309
They love to get back there.

16:16.393 --> 16:18.353
They can really help.
Some of 'em got a good arm.

-Us, too.

16:25.443 --> 16:27.445
Hey, this is Jason and Richard.

-on the field, little man.
-Yeah.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.914
It's time to see if anything

looked totally good and normal.

<i>They're already</i>
<i>at a healthy weight to be born.</i>

Not even medium rare?

17:21.416 --> 17:22.709
(chuckles)

17:22.792 --> 17:24.461
No, perfectly medium.

<i>-This is getting away from us.</i>
-Yes, it is.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.098
My lips are sealed there, hotshot.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.984
Feel a little better?

21:58.068 --> 21:59.778
Yeah.

22:20.548 --> 22:23.593
What if I'm not actually
that good at football?

22:26.054 --> 22:28.431
(sighs)
That means I have nothing.

22:28.515 --> 22:30.225
Nothing?

22:31.559 --> 22:34.312
Kev, what are you talking about?

22:36.356 --> 22:38.692
You and Mom talk about it all the time.

22:38.775 --> 22:41.194
Randall's a genius,
and all I have is football.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.154
That is not all you have.

22:43.238 --> 22:45.615
I heard you and Mom talking the other day.

22:45.699 --> 22:48.243
You told her I was soft.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.372
(sighs)

22:55.375 --> 22:59.713
Look, I don't know
exactly what you overheard,

22:59.796 --> 23:01.840
but that's not what I meant.

23:01.923 --> 23:03.925
Yes, it is, or you wouldn't be here.

23:05.010 --> 23:07.345
What is that supposed to mean?

23:07.429 --> 23:09.264
(sighs)

23:09.347 --> 23:11.307
We never do anything alone together.

23:11.391 --> 23:16.187
But you took the time
to bring me here, because...

23:16.271 --> 23:19.065
you think that football's
my only shot at being special.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.569
That's what you think I think?

23:22.652 --> 23:24.696
I know that's what you think.

23:24.779 --> 23:28.199
And Coach doesn't think
I have what it takes.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.201
He just yells at me all the time.

23:30.285 --> 23:33.413
He...
That's just his style, Kev, okay?

23:33.496 --> 23:35.040
Coach is old-school.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.541
He wouldn't have brought you here

23:36.624 --> 23:38.209
if he didn't think you were good enough.

23:38.293 --> 23:40.211
He calls me names, and...

23:40.295 --> 23:42.047
he says I'm stupid.

23:43.757 --> 23:45.759
He calls you "stupid"?

23:46.843 --> 23:48.428
Kevin?

23:48.511 --> 23:52.223
He tells me I'm stupid
pretty much every day of my life.

24:06.571 --> 24:08.573
Let's settle that stomach of yours.

24:08.656 --> 24:10.575
-Dad, I'm not hungry.
-Come on.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.577
I have a super early morning.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.120

-No, I can't get a signal.

36:35.278 --> 36:36.696
I had to pull a guy out of his car

36:36.780 --> 36:37.781
and drive him to the hospital.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.699
Wow, that's amazing.

36:39.783 --> 36:41.701
Thank you.
Yeah, it's just that my, um,

36:41.785 --> 36:43.953
my-my ID, it was in my jacket,

36:44.037 --> 36:47.374
and the jacket-- I gave...
I gave that man my jacket.

36:47.457 --> 36:49.918
Or-or it fell out or something--
anyway, I...

36:50.001 --> 36:52.295
I don't have my ID on me.

36:52.379 --> 36:54.381
I'm so sorry, sir.
I can't let you on the plane

36:54.464 --> 36:56.049
without your ID.

36:57.342 --> 36:59.594
Right, yeah, it's just, um...

37:00.929 --> 37:03.848
Look, uh...

37:03.932 --> 37:06.309
I'm Kevin Pearson,
I'm-I'm a public figure.

37:06.393 --> 37:08.687
I'm not trying to say that
to get special treatment,

37:08.770 --> 37:11.064
I'm-I'm saying that
because it's just, you know,

37:11.147 --> 37:13.358
it's-- you can look me up,
it's very easy to figure out

37:13.441 --> 37:14.984
who I am, you can look me up online.

37:15.068 --> 37:17.153
My whole damn life is online.
(chuckles)

37:17.237 --> 37:20.615
That's not really how it works.

37:20.699 --> 37:23.159
There's an office where
you can request an emergency ID.

37:23.243 --> 37:25.370
-Usually takes about a day.
-I don't have a day.

37:25.453 --> 37:28.081
Okay? My fiancée right now
is in Los Angeles and she's in labor.

37:28.164 --> 37:29.499
I need to get to her, please.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.376
You got to let me on that flight.

37:33.253 --> 37:35.296
I'm really sorry.
I wish I could help,

37:35.380 --> 37:37.757
but it's really not up to me.

37:42.762 --> 37:46.141
Listen, I can't start off
by not being there for them.

37:46.224 --> 37:48.768
You need to understand that.

37:48.852 --> 37:50.687
♪ ♪

38:02.574 --> 38:04.701
I can't.
I don't...

38:06.202 --> 38:07.954
I don't know how else
to explain it to you, okay?

38:08.038 --> 38:09.998
It will break me.

38:14.919 --> 38:16.296
I'm begging you, please,

38:16.379 --> 38:18.548
figure out a way to get me on that flight.

38:23.720 --> 38:25.513
(exhales)

38:25.597 --> 38:27.140
MIDWIFE:
Only three centimeters.

38:27.223 --> 38:29.142
We have a ways to go.

38:29.225 --> 38:32.687
But these things can speed up
quickly sometimes.

38:32.771 --> 38:34.314
There's really no telling.

38:34.397 --> 38:36.232
Hang in there.

38:38.068 --> 38:39.819
(sighs)

38:39.903 --> 38:42.238
Everything okay?

38:44.449 --> 38:47.202
I just, um,

38:47.285 --> 38:50.580
I can't believe
I'm maybe gonna do this alone.

38:50.663 --> 38:52.415
Why don't you call someone?

38:52.499 --> 38:55.210
Mom, friend?

38:55.293 --> 38:58.588
It might help pass the time.

38:58.672 --> 39:01.132
I'm not close to my mom.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.510
Or anyone in my family, really.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.389
To be honest, there's really
only two people in the world

39:07.472 --> 39:11.935
I am truly close to, and, um...

39:12.018 --> 39:14.854
well, one of them is having
a baby of her own

39:14.938 --> 39:18.274
and the other is hopefully on a plane.

39:18.358 --> 39:21.194
But who knows?
I can't reach him.

39:21.277 --> 39:24.572
I have to check on my other mamas,

39:24.656 --> 39:27.992
but I'll come back as soon as I can, okay?

39:32.414 --> 39:34.416
(exhales)

39:37.168 --> 39:40.505
(crying softly)

39:40.588 --> 39:42.590
(phone buzzing)

39:48.096 --> 39:49.514
Hello?

39:49.597 --> 39:52.434
Hi, Madison.
It's Randall.

39:52.517 --> 39:54.728
-And Beth.
-And Beth.

39:54.811 --> 39:57.814
Um, I spoke to Kevin.

39:57.897 --> 40:00.066
I know he's trying to get to you,

40:00.150 --> 40:02.819
but we just wanted to say
if you need anything

40:02.902 --> 40:06.656
in the meantime, don't hesitate to call.

40:06.740 --> 40:09.534
Uh, we're still driving back
from New Orleans,

40:09.617 --> 40:13.329
so if you want us
to have some food sent over there

40:13.413 --> 40:15.790
or anything,

40:15.874 --> 40:19.669
we-we just want you to know
that we're here.

40:23.715 --> 40:25.133
Okay.

40:25.216 --> 40:28.136
(grunts softly)
Uh, thank you.

40:31.890 --> 40:34.100
Um, or if you want,

40:34.184 --> 40:37.354
we can stay on the phone
with you for a while.

40:37.437 --> 40:38.563
No.

40:38.646 --> 40:41.399
No, no, um, I'm-I'm fine.

40:41.483 --> 40:43.943
You sure?

40:45.904 --> 40:48.573
<i>Madison, we really can stay on with you.</i>

40:49.657 --> 40:51.826
You're family.

40:51.910 --> 40:53.912
(crying)

41:04.881 --> 41:06.341
Okay.

41:06.424 --> 41:07.967
Um...

41:08.051 --> 41:11.471
Yeah, that'd be really nice, actually.

41:11.554 --> 41:12.681
<i>RANDALL:</i>
<i>Of course.</i>

41:12.764 --> 41:14.974
As long as you need.

41:19.854 --> 41:21.564
