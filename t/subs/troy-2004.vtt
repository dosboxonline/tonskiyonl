02:54.759 --> 02:58.261
« Men are haunted
by the vastness of eternity. »

02:59.513 --> 03:01.348
« And so we ask ourselves... »

03:02.099 --> 03:05.310
« ...will our actions echo
across the centuries? »

03:06.187 --> 03:10.273
« Will strangers hear our names
long after we're gone... »

03:10.608 --> 03:12.609
« ...and wonder who we were... »

03:12.943 --> 03:14.944
« ...how bravely we fought... »

03:15.988 --> 03:17.989
« ...how fiercely we loved? »

04:38.446 --> 04:39.654
Good day for the crows.

04:40.739 --> 04:45.201
I told you yesterday
and I'll tell you again today.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.871
Remove your army from my land.

04:48.038 --> 04:49.873
I like your land.

04:50.458 --> 04:53.543
I think we'll stay.
I like your soldiers too.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.920
They fought bravely yesterday.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.423
Not well, but bravely.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.175
They won't fight for you.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.385
That's what the Messenians said.

05:02.553 --> 05:05.513
And the Arcadians and the Epeians.

05:05.681 --> 05:08.725
Now... they all fight for me.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.394
You can't have the whole world, Agamemnon.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.897
It's too big, even for you.

05:14.190 --> 05:16.733
I don't want to watch another massacre.

05:17.067 --> 05:22.030
Let's settle this war in the old manner.
Your best fighter against my best.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.701
And if my man wins?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.870
We'll leave Thessaly for good.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.080
I'm a generous man.

05:31.248 --> 05:34.000
If mine wins, you can keep your throne...

05:34.543 --> 05:37.128
...but Thessaly falls under my command...

05:37.296 --> 05:40.548
...to fight with me whenever I call.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.179
Boagrius!

06:03.531 --> 06:05.031
This is my man.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.203
Achilles!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.472
Boagrius has this effect on many heroes.

06:22.633 --> 06:24.467
Careful who you insult, old king.

06:28.013 --> 06:31.057
My king... Achilles is not with the army.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.977
- Where is he?
- I sent a boy to look for him.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.266
I was having a good dream.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.186
Very good dream.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.960
King... Agamemnon sent me. He needs to...

07:21.980 --> 07:24.080
I'll speak to your king in the morning.

07:24.270 --> 07:25.270
« But my lord, »

07:25.806 --> 07:27.306
it is morning.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.034
They're waiting for you.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.092
Are the stories about you true?

07:49.928 --> 07:52.722
They say your mother is
an immortal goddess.

07:54.433 --> 07:56.017
They say you can't be killed.

07:56.185 --> 07:59.062
I wouldn't be bothering
with the shield then, would I?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.564
The Thessalonian you're fighting...

08:01.732 --> 08:06.069
...he's the biggest man I've ever seen.
I wouldn't want to fight him.

08:08.364 --> 08:10.990
That's why no one will remember your name.

08:18.700 --> 08:22.200
« Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

08:22.250 --> 08:25.750
« Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

08:25.800 --> 08:29.300
« Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

08:35.724 --> 08:39.227
Perhaps we should have our war tomorrow,
when you're better rested.

08:39.395 --> 08:41.938
I should have you whipped
for your impudence!

08:44.616 --> 08:46.158
Perhaps you should fight him.

08:46.318 --> 08:47.985
Achilles.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.571
Achilles.

08:52.282 --> 08:56.119
Look at the men's faces.
You can save hundreds of them.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.998
You can end this war
with a swing of your sword.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.670
Think how many songs they'll sing
in your honor.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.798
Let them go home to their wives.

09:14.596 --> 09:19.267
Imagine a king who fights his own battles.
Wouldn't that be a sight.

09:22.479 --> 09:27.400
Of all the warlords loved by the gods,
I hate him the most.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.862
We need him, my king.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.573
For now.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.211
Is there no one else?

10:33.717 --> 10:35.468
Is there no one else?

10:40.474 --> 10:42.099
Who are you, soldier?

10:43.101 --> 10:46.062
Achilles. Son of Peleus.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.314
Achilles?

10:49.066 --> 10:50.900
I'll remember the name.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.446
The ruler of Thessaly
carries this scepter.

10:57.241 --> 10:58.574
Give it to your king.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.702
He's not my king.

11:06.350 --> 11:11.350
<b><font color="#c0c0c0">FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</font></b>

11:20.806 --> 11:23.349
- Brothers in arms!
- Brothers in arms!

11:23.517 --> 11:25.726
- Friendship!
- Friendship!

11:33.360 --> 11:36.696
Princes of Troy,
on our last night together...

11:37.489 --> 11:39.323
...Queen Helen and I salute you.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.453
We've had our conflicts before, it's true.

11:45.122 --> 11:48.332
We fought many battles, Sparta and Troy.
And fought well!

11:50.586 --> 11:52.962
But I have always respected your father.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.715
Priam is a good king, a good man.

11:55.883 --> 11:59.927
I respected him as an adversary.
I respect him now as my ally.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.890
Hector, Paris, young princes, come. Stand.

12:04.433 --> 12:05.766
Drink with me.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.729
Let us drink to peace.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.150
To peace... between Troy and Sparta.

12:15.650 --> 12:18.850
May the gods keep the wolves in the hills
and the women in our beds.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.140
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

12:47.976 --> 12:50.770
Strong arm. Thank the gods we made peace.

12:50.938 --> 12:54.482
I've seen too many of my men struck down
with this arm.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.775
Never again, I hope.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.862
« Only one man wields a sword
better than you.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.030
« Achilles.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.365
« That madman.

13:02.530 --> 13:04.120
« He would hurl a spear at...

13:04.130 --> 13:06.730
Zeus himself.
If the god insulted him.

13:10.374 --> 13:14.251
See that one over there?
I picked her special for you.

13:14.586 --> 13:17.797
She's a little lioness.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.885
Thank you. My wife waits for me in Troy.

13:24.012 --> 13:26.597
My wife waits for me right there.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.057
Wives are for breeding.

13:28.225 --> 13:32.061
You understand, for making little princes.
Come enjoy yourself tonight.

13:33.855 --> 13:36.524
You make excellent wine in Sparta.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.701
You shouldn't be here.

14:32.914 --> 14:35.291
That's what you said last night.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.419
Last night was a mistake.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.631
And the night before?

14:43.717 --> 14:46.218
I've made many mistakes this week.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.111
Do you want me to go?

15:07.908 --> 15:09.258
Yes.

15:20.462 --> 15:22.338
Where should I go?

15:23.673 --> 15:25.257
Away.

15:26.968 --> 15:28.677
Far away.

16:24.860 --> 16:27.111
I have something for you.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.579
Pearls from the Sea of Propontis.

16:47.799 --> 16:49.508
They're beautiful.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.179
But I can't wear them.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.515
Menelaus would kill us both.

16:58.602 --> 17:00.436
Don't be afraid of him.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.689
I'm not afraid of dying.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.694
I'm afraid of tomorrow.

17:12.031 --> 17:16.117
I'm afraid of watching you sail away
and knowing you'll never come back.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.919
Before you came to Sparta, I was a ghost.

17:26.503 --> 17:29.673
I walked, and I ate,
and I swam in the sea...

17:30.800 --> 17:32.968
...but I was just a ghost.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.137
You don't have to fear tomorrow.

17:39.643 --> 17:41.435
Come with me.

17:49.486 --> 17:52.112
Don't play with me... Don't play.

17:53.490 --> 17:56.533
If you come, we'll never be safe.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.579
Men will hunt us, the gods will curse us.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.040
But I'll love you.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.336
Till the day they burn my body...

18:08.255 --> 18:10.172
...I will love you.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.282
Tecton.

18:37.701 --> 18:40.869
Make the proper offerings to Poseidon
before we sail.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.205
We don't need any more widows in Troy.

18:43.707 --> 18:45.624
Goat or pig?

18:47.168 --> 18:49.044
Which does the sea god prefer?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.506
I'll wake the priest and ask him.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.094
Paris.

19:01.891 --> 19:05.561
We should get to bed.
We won't sleep on land again for weeks.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.355
I have no trouble sleeping on the seas,
brother.

19:08.523 --> 19:10.524
Athena sings lullabies to me.

19:12.402 --> 19:14.737
And who sang lullabies to you tonight?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.697
Tonight?

19:18.533 --> 19:21.410
Tonight was the fisherman's wife.

19:22.245 --> 19:23.746
A lovely creature.

19:24.873 --> 19:27.333
I hope you didn't let
the fisherman catch you.

19:28.626 --> 19:30.711
He was more concerned with the fish.

19:31.004 --> 19:33.047
You do understand why we're in Sparta.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.465
For peace.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.516
And you understand that Menelaus,
the king of Sparta,

19:37.567 --> 19:39.061
is a very powerful man.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.680
And that his brother Agamemnon,
the king of Mycenae...

19:41.848 --> 19:43.891
...commands all the Greek forces.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.519
What does this have to do
with the fisherman's wife?

19:47.687 --> 19:49.104
Paris...

19:49.272 --> 19:51.565
...you're my brother and I love you.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.234
But if you do anything to endanger Troy...

19:54.402 --> 19:58.113
...I will rip your pretty face
from your pretty skull.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.912
Now get some sleep.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.456
We sail in the morning.

20:31.189 --> 20:35.401
A beautiful morning.
Poseidon has blessed our voyage.

20:35.980 --> 20:37.875
Sometimes the gods bless you
in the morning

20:37.885 --> 20:39.885
and curse you in the afternoon.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.847
« Drop sail!

20:44.494 --> 20:45.994
Do you love me, brother?

20:47.539 --> 20:49.665
Would you protect me against any enemy?

20:52.669 --> 20:54.878
The last time you spoke to me like this...

20:55.046 --> 20:58.382
...you were 10 years old,
and you'd just stolen Father's horse.

20:59.509 --> 21:00.759
What have you done now?

21:02.762 --> 21:04.138
I must show you something.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.631
- Where is she?
- Who, my king?

21:39.966 --> 21:44.344
I swear by the father of the gods,
I will gut you here if you don't tell me!

21:45.889 --> 21:47.381
My king!

21:48.475 --> 21:49.892
She left.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.027
With the Trojans.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.568
« The fisherman here saw her
board their ship.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.070
The Trojans?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.573
With the young prince, Paris. She...

22:11.331 --> 22:13.499
Get my ship ready.

22:14.959 --> 22:17.085
Turn us round. Back to Sparta.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.545
« High on the sail!

22:18.713 --> 22:20.255
- Wait, wait.
- You fool!

22:20.423 --> 22:22.758
- Listen to me.
- Do you know what you've done?

22:23.051 --> 22:26.428
Do you know how many years
our father worked for peace?

22:26.930 --> 22:28.847
I love her.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.934
It's all a game to you, isn't it?

22:32.101 --> 22:35.938
You roam from town to town,
bedding merchants' wives and temple mates.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.106
You think you know something about love.

22:38.440 --> 22:39.940
What about your father's love?

22:39.950 --> 22:42.450
You spat on him
when you brought her on this ship!

22:42.820 --> 22:46.740
What about the love for your country?
You'd let Troy burn for this woman?

22:50.411 --> 22:52.663
I won't let you start a war for her.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.331
May I speak?

22:55.500 --> 22:59.586
What you're saying is true.
I've wronged you. I've wronged our father.

22:59.754 --> 23:02.798
If you want to take Helen back to Sparta,
so be it.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.342
But I go with her.

23:06.094 --> 23:07.761
To Sparta? They'll kill you.

23:07.929 --> 23:10.264
Then I'll die fighting.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.870
Oh, and that sounds heroic to you,
doesn't it?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.170
To die fighting.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.385
Little brother,
have you ever killed a man?

23:16.488 --> 23:17.288
No.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.398
- Ever seen a man die in combat?
- No.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.014
I've killed men,
and I've heard them dying.

23:22.065 --> 23:23.869
And I've watched them dying.

23:23.987 --> 23:26.822
And there's nothing glorious about it.
Nothing poetic.

23:26.990 --> 23:30.242
You say you want to die for love.
You know nothing about dying.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.619
And you know nothing about love!

23:32.787 --> 23:35.664
All the same, I go with her.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.041
I won't ask you to fight my war.

23:41.337 --> 23:43.088
You already have.

23:45.133 --> 23:46.592
To Troy!

23:46.759 --> 23:49.803
« About ship! Set sail!

24:22.170 --> 24:25.589
- I want her back.
- Well, of course you do.

24:25.757 --> 24:27.299
She's a beautiful woman.

24:27.508 --> 24:31.053
I want her back so I can kill her
with my own two hands.

24:31.596 --> 24:34.598
I won't rest till I've burned Troy
to the ground.

24:34.766 --> 24:36.850
I thought you wanted peace with Troy.

24:37.393 --> 24:38.894
I should have listened to you.

24:39.062 --> 24:41.355
Peace is for the women...

24:41.856 --> 24:43.732
...and the weak.

24:44.734 --> 24:48.236
Empires are forged by war.

24:49.906 --> 24:53.700
All my life, I've stood by your side,
fought your enemies.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.913
You're the elder, you reap the glory.
This is the way of the world.

24:58.247 --> 25:01.708
But have I ever complained?
Have I ever asked you for anything?

25:01.876 --> 25:04.628
Never. You're a man of honor.

25:05.630 --> 25:07.506
Everyone in Greece knows this.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.550
The Trojans spat on my honor.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.680
An insult to me is an insult to you.

25:15.014 --> 25:19.267
And an insult to me
is an insult to all Greeks.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.604
Will you go to war with me, brother?

25:35.076 --> 25:38.245
I always thought my brother's wife
was a foolish woman...

25:38.413 --> 25:41.915
...but she's proved to be very useful.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.170
Nothing unifies a people
like a common enemy.

25:47.338 --> 25:49.506
The Trojans have never been conquered.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.800
Some say they can't be conquered.

25:53.302 --> 25:57.639
Old King Priam thinks he's untouchable
behind his high walls.

25:58.141 --> 26:01.101
He thinks the sun god will protect him.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.895
But the gods protect only...

26:04.814 --> 26:06.648
...the strong!

26:07.400 --> 26:09.651
If Troy falls...

26:09.940 --> 26:11.367
...I control...

26:12.270 --> 26:13.170
the Aegean.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.907
Hector commands the finest army
in the east.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.286
And Troy is built to withstand
a 10-year siege.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.830
There won't be a 10-year siege.

26:21.998 --> 26:25.417
I'll attack them with the greatest force
the world has ever seen.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.879
I want all the kings of Greece
and their armies.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.964
Send emissaries in the morning.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.382
« One last thing.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.886
« We need Achilles and his Myrmidons.

26:38.014 --> 26:39.514
Achilles.

26:41.893 --> 26:46.188
He can't be controlled.
He's as likely to fight us as the Trojans.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.775
We don't need to control him,
we need to unleash him.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.944
That man was born to end lives.

26:53.112 --> 26:57.532
Yes, he's a gifted killer.
But he threatens everything I've built.

26:57.784 --> 27:02.162
Before me, Greece was nothing.
I brought all the Greek kingdoms together.

27:02.330 --> 27:06.208
I created a nation out of fire worshipers
and snake eaters!

27:06.375 --> 27:09.127
I build the future, Nestor. Me!

27:11.214 --> 27:13.381
Achilles is the past.

27:13.549 --> 27:17.886
A man who fights for no flag.
A man loyal to no country.

27:18.100 --> 27:21.600
How many battles
have we won off the edge of his sword?

27:21.766 --> 27:25.018
This will be the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

27:25.186 --> 27:27.604
We need the greatest warrior.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.070
There's only one man he'll listen to.

27:35.905 --> 27:37.739
I'll send a ship in the morning.

27:49.627 --> 27:50.794
Greetings, brother.

27:50.962 --> 27:54.840
We were told
King Odysseus is hid in the hills.

27:55.508 --> 27:57.259
Odysseus?

27:59.512 --> 28:03.139
That old bastard drinks my wine
and never pays.

28:03.890 --> 28:05.590
You ought to respect your king,

28:05.900 --> 28:07.100
« ...friend.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.895
Respect him?

28:09.063 --> 28:11.273
I'd like to punch him in the face.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.401
He's always pawing at my wife,
trying to tear her clothes off.

28:21.742 --> 28:25.120
I hope Agamemnon's generals are smarter
than his emissaries.

28:30.543 --> 28:31.960
What did you say?

28:35.464 --> 28:37.674
You want me to help you fight the Trojans.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.682
You're...

28:46.684 --> 28:48.143
Are you...?

28:52.064 --> 28:55.275
Forgive us, King Odysseus.

28:59.363 --> 29:00.780
Well...

29:01.449 --> 29:03.199
I'm gonna miss my dog.

29:03.826 --> 29:06.912
King Agamemnon has a favor to ask of you.

29:08.873 --> 29:10.790
Of course he does.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.234
Never hesitate.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.962
Fancy swordplay.

30:00.580 --> 30:01.380
Nervous?

30:04.804 --> 30:06.805
Petrified.

30:08.224 --> 30:10.976
You told me never to change sword hands.

30:11.560 --> 30:16.022
Yes. When you know how to use it,
you won't be taking my orders.

30:34.580 --> 30:35.680
« Your reputation

30:35.690 --> 30:37.690
for hospitality is fast becoming legend.

30:44.635 --> 30:46.720
Patroclus, my cousin.

30:47.096 --> 30:49.931
Odysseus, king of Ithaca.

30:50.307 --> 30:52.100
Patroclus.

30:53.936 --> 30:55.562
I knew your parents well.

30:55.730 --> 30:57.355
I miss them.

30:59.734 --> 31:02.777
Now you have this one
watching over you, eh?

31:02.945 --> 31:05.155
Learning from Achilles himself.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.158
Kings would kill for the honor.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.110
Are you here at Agamemnon's bidding?

31:13.414 --> 31:14.789
We need to talk.

31:18.794 --> 31:20.795
I will not fight for him.

31:21.172 --> 31:23.923
I'm not asking you to fight for him.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.176
I'm asking you to fight for Greece.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.636
Have the Greeks tired of fighting
each other?

31:28.970 --> 31:29.870
For now.

31:29.980 --> 31:30.980
« - For the Greeks! »

31:32.767 --> 31:34.976
The Trojans never harmed me.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.228
They insulted Greece.

31:37.390 --> 31:39.820
They insulted a man
who couldn't hold on to his wife.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.330
Is that my business?

31:41.400 --> 31:44.027
Your business is war, my friend.

31:44.195 --> 31:47.405
Is it?
Am I the whore of the battlefield?

31:48.115 --> 31:50.075
The man has no honor.

31:50.659 --> 31:52.911
I won't be remembered
as a tyrant's mercenary.

31:53.079 --> 31:56.664
Let Achilles fight for honor.
Let Agamemnon fight for power.

31:56.832 --> 32:00.085
And let the gods decide
which man to glorify.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.338
Forget Agamemnon.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.048
Fight for me.

32:05.460 --> 32:06.360
My wife...

32:06.370 --> 32:08.870
« will feel much better if she knows
you're by my side.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.137
I'll feel much better.

32:11.806 --> 32:14.432
Is Ajax going to fight in Troy?

32:14.600 --> 32:18.436
They say he can fell an oak tree
with one swing of the ax.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.232
Trees don't swing back.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.946
We're sending the largest fleet
that ever sailed.

32:29.532 --> 32:31.282
A thousand ships.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.035
« A thousand ships?

32:34.537 --> 32:37.163
Prince Hector.
Is he as good a warrior as they say?

32:37.540 --> 32:40.542
The best of all the Trojans.

32:40.709 --> 32:43.962
Some say he's better
than all the Greeks too.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.632
« Even if your cousin doesn't come...

32:47.842 --> 32:51.386
...I hope you'll join us.
We could use a strong arm like yours.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.806
Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin.

32:55.182 --> 32:58.893
You have your swords. I have my tricks.

32:59.353 --> 33:01.396
We play with the toys the gods give us.

33:03.232 --> 33:05.066
We sail for Troy in three days.

33:09.405 --> 33:12.407
This war will never be forgotten.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.661
Nor will the heroes who fight in it.

33:41.687 --> 33:45.190
They say the king of Ithaca
has a silver tongue.

33:46.775 --> 33:48.610
I knew they would come for you.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.154
Long before you were born...

33:51.322 --> 33:53.448
...I knew they would come.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.830
They want you to fight in Troy.

34:07.922 --> 34:10.965
I'm making you another seashell necklace.

34:11.759 --> 34:14.219
Like the ones I made you
when you were a boy.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.969
Do you remember?

34:23.353 --> 34:24.812
Mother...

34:26.649 --> 34:28.565
...tonight, I decide.

34:33.656 --> 34:36.157
If you stay in Lárisa...

34:36.992 --> 34:38.618
...you will find peace.

34:38.786 --> 34:40.578
You will find a wonderful woman.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.498
You will have sons and daughters,
and they will have children.

34:44.667 --> 34:46.668
And they will love you.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.088
When you are gone, they will remember you.

34:53.342 --> 34:57.345
But when your children are dead
and their children after them...

34:58.347 --> 35:00.473
...your name will be lost.

35:04.270 --> 35:05.645
If you go to Troy...

35:06.772 --> 35:09.399
...glory will be yours.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.700
They will write stories
about your victories

35:12.710 --> 35:14.410
for thousands of years.

35:16.198 --> 35:19.325
The world will remember your name.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.830
But if you go to Troy...

35:26.375 --> 35:28.751
...you will never come home.

35:30.004 --> 35:33.881
For your glory walks hand in hand
with your doom.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.553
And I shall never see you again.

35:42.308 --> 35:44.600
You know this to be true, Mother?

35:45.436 --> 35:47.437
I know this.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.618
- My son.
- Father.

38:12.708 --> 38:13.958
Paris.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.050
Father.

38:24.386 --> 38:27.346
- This is Helen.
- Helen?

38:27.806 --> 38:29.891
Helen of Sparta?

38:32.311 --> 38:33.728
Helen of Troy.

38:40.277 --> 38:43.404
I've heard rumors of your beauty.

38:44.907 --> 38:46.574
For once...

38:47.034 --> 38:48.993
...the gossips were right.

38:52.289 --> 38:53.623
Welcome.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.584
Thank you, good king.

38:56.752 --> 38:59.128
Come, you must be tired.

39:11.808 --> 39:13.518
Look.

39:15.312 --> 39:17.104
He's grown.

39:17.606 --> 39:19.524
He is strong.

39:19.733 --> 39:21.859
He's just like his father.

39:22.980 --> 39:24.080
« Paris!

39:24.090 --> 39:25.290
Briseis!

39:29.743 --> 39:32.912
Beloved cousin, your beauty grows
with each new moon.

39:34.581 --> 39:35.831
Briseis.

39:38.293 --> 39:39.710
A servant of Apollo now.

39:39.878 --> 39:44.298
The young men of Troy were devastated
when Briseis chose the virgin robes.

39:44.466 --> 39:45.591
Uncle.

39:48.971 --> 39:52.723
I thank the gods for your safe return.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.979
- For the gods.
- For the gods.

39:58.146 --> 39:59.897
For gods.

40:14.997 --> 40:16.497
« Father...

40:16.665 --> 40:19.166
« I know
this is the last thing we need.

40:19.330 --> 40:20.930
« It is the will of the gods.

40:20.940 --> 40:23.840
Everything is in their hands.

40:24.464 --> 40:28.926
- But I'm surprised you let him bring her.
- If I'd let him fight Menelaus for her...

40:29.094 --> 40:31.971
...you'd be burning a son's body,
not welcoming a daughter.

40:32.139 --> 40:34.890
We could send peace envoys to Menelaus.

40:35.058 --> 40:38.185
You know Menelaus.
He'd spear their heads to his gate.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.771
What would you have me do?

40:42.316 --> 40:44.734
Put her on a ship and send her home.

40:47.863 --> 40:50.906
Women have always loved Paris,
and he has loved them back...

40:51.074 --> 40:52.992
but this is different.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.494
Something has changed in him.

40:55.662 --> 40:59.457
If we send her home to Menelaus,
he will follow her.

41:00.375 --> 41:03.336
This is my country,
and these are my countrymen.

41:03.545 --> 41:07.006
I don't want to see them suffer
so my brother can have his prize.

41:07.883 --> 41:10.092
It's not just the Spartans
coming after her.

41:10.302 --> 41:12.553
By now, Menelaus has gone to Agamemnon.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.556
And Agamemnon has wanted
to destroy us for years.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.100
Once we're out of the way,
he controls the seas.

41:18.600 --> 41:21.270
Enemies have been attacking us
for centuries.

41:21.280 --> 41:23.280
Our walls still stand.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.901
Father, we can't win this war.

41:27.778 --> 41:30.112
Apollo watches over us.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.824
Even Agamemnon is no match for the gods.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.744
And how many battalions
does the sun god command?

41:36.912 --> 41:38.496
Do not mock the gods.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.920
« When you were very young,
you came down with scarlet fever.

41:46.088 --> 41:49.215
Your little hand was so hot.

41:49.383 --> 41:52.635
The healer said
you would not last the night.

41:52.886 --> 41:58.766
I went down to Apollo's temple
and I prayed until the sun came up.

41:58.975 --> 42:03.229
That walk back to the palace
was the longest of my life.

42:03.397 --> 42:07.775
But I went into your mother's room
and you were sleeping in her arms.

42:07.943 --> 42:09.694
The fever had broken.

42:10.654 --> 42:14.448
« I promised that day
to dedicate my life to the gods.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.617
I will not break my promise.

42:16.785 --> 42:19.735
For thirty years I have worked for peace.

42:19.745 --> 42:21.245
Thirty years.

42:21.915 --> 42:25.000
« Paris is a fool sometimes,
I know that.

42:25.168 --> 42:29.964
But I will fight 1,000 wars
before letting him die.

42:30.841 --> 42:34.969
Forgive me, Father,
but you won't be the one fighting.

42:54.823 --> 42:56.615
They're coming for me.

42:57.659 --> 42:59.493
The wind is bringing them closer.

42:59.661 --> 43:01.328
What if we left?

43:01.496 --> 43:04.331
Tonight. Right now.

43:04.499 --> 43:08.294
What if we went down to the stables,
took two horses and left?

43:08.503 --> 43:10.963
Ride east, keep riding.

43:11.131 --> 43:13.841
- And go where?
- Away from here.

43:14.342 --> 43:17.762
I could hunt deer, rabbit.
I could feed us.

43:20.766 --> 43:23.184
But this is your home.

43:23.894 --> 43:26.312
You left your home for me.

43:30.192 --> 43:32.443
Sparta was never my home.

43:33.028 --> 43:36.363
My parents sent my there when I was 16
to marry Menelaus.

43:36.531 --> 43:37.990
But it was never my home.

43:38.158 --> 43:40.075
We'll live off the land.

43:40.243 --> 43:44.205
No more palaces for us. No more servants.
We don't need any of that.

43:44.372 --> 43:45.790
And your family?

43:45.950 --> 43:47.650
We'd be protecting my family.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.900
If we're not here,
what's the need for war?

43:50.003 --> 43:53.756
Menelaus won't give up.
He'll track us to the end of the world.

43:53.965 --> 43:57.843
He doesn't know these lands. I do.
We can lose ourselves in a day.

43:58.011 --> 43:59.887
You don't know Menelaus.

44:00.055 --> 44:02.181
You don't know his brother.

44:02.724 --> 44:06.227
They'll burn every house in Troy
to find us.

44:07.479 --> 44:09.980
They'll never believe we've left.

44:10.148 --> 44:13.901
And even if they do,
they'll burn it for spite.

44:17.113 --> 44:19.657
Then I'll make it easy for him to find me.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.954
I'll walk right up to him
and tell him you're mine.

44:34.840 --> 44:36.882
You're very young, my love.

44:39.469 --> 44:41.345
We're the same age.

44:43.682 --> 44:46.308
You're younger than I ever was.

48:26.780 --> 48:29.280
« Take up your positions!

48:53.180 --> 48:54.330
Black sail.

48:55.240 --> 48:56.440
« It's Achilles.

48:56.518 --> 48:57.935
« What's the fool doing?

48:58.353 --> 49:02.022
He's going to take the beach of Troy
with 50 men?

49:05.318 --> 49:07.986
« Row, Myrmidon, row!

49:11.199 --> 49:12.533
My lord?

49:14.202 --> 49:16.203
Should we wait for the others?

49:17.372 --> 49:20.374
- They brought us here for war.
- Yes, but Agamemnon's orders...

49:20.542 --> 49:23.043
You fight for me, Eudorus, or Agamemnon?

49:23.211 --> 49:24.545
For you, my lord.

49:24.700 --> 49:26.000
Then fight for me.

49:26.010 --> 49:28.610
And let the servants of Agamemnon
fight for him.

49:37.684 --> 49:39.810
« Make way there! Make way!

49:50.572 --> 49:53.949
Tecton, is the Apollonian Guard ready?

49:54.110 --> 49:56.960
- Waiting at the city gates.
- Good. I'll be right there.

49:56.970 --> 49:57.970
« I get it!

49:58.246 --> 50:00.998
Lysander,
how long before the army is ready?

50:01.166 --> 50:04.293
Half of our men are still coming.
We have to arm them

50:04.460 --> 50:05.961
- How long?
- Noon.

50:06.129 --> 50:07.796
Make it sooner.

50:07.964 --> 50:11.175
And Lysander, I want patrols
to scour the countryside.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.093
I want every home and pasture checked...

50:13.161 --> 50:15.387
...every Trojan to be brought inside
the city walls.

50:15.555 --> 50:17.472
If they can't walk, carry them.

50:32.405 --> 50:34.114
Patroclus!

50:37.118 --> 50:38.660
Put down your spear.

50:38.828 --> 50:40.913
- I'm fighting the Trojans.
- Not today.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.998
I'm ready. You taught me how to fight.

50:43.166 --> 50:47.044
And you're a good student.
But you're not a Myrmidon yet.

50:48.963 --> 50:50.464
Look at these men.

50:50.630 --> 50:53.025
They are the fiercest soldiers
in all of Greece.

50:53.100 --> 50:54.800
Each of them has bled for me.

50:55.094 --> 50:57.095
- Guard the ship.
- But this is a war.

50:57.260 --> 51:00.560
Cousin, I can't fight the Trojans
if I'm concerned for you.

51:00.600 --> 51:01.800
Guard the ship.

51:22.789 --> 51:24.498
« Trojans!

51:27.335 --> 51:30.254
All my life, I've lived by a code.

51:30.755 --> 51:32.798
And the code is simple:

51:32.966 --> 51:36.468
Honor the gods, love your woman...

51:36.636 --> 51:37.886
...and defend your country.

51:40.348 --> 51:42.266
Troy is mother to us all.

51:42.892 --> 51:44.142
Fight for her!

52:03.760 --> 52:04.910
Myrmidons...

52:06.416 --> 52:08.166
...my brothers of the sword.

52:09.585 --> 52:12.605
I'd rather fight beside you
than any army of thousands.

52:13.172 --> 52:16.550
Let no man forget how menacing we are.
We are lions!

52:20.430 --> 52:25.225
Do you know what's there, waiting,
beyond that beach?

52:25.393 --> 52:28.562
Immortality! Take it! It's yours!

52:41.576 --> 52:43.035
« Fight positions!

52:43.202 --> 52:45.078
« Archers!

52:45.997 --> 52:47.748
« Archers, draw!

52:49.667 --> 52:51.084
« Draw!

53:07.685 --> 53:09.394
Keep forward!

53:28.748 --> 53:30.332
Form up!

53:30.833 --> 53:32.376
Formation!

53:33.086 --> 53:35.212
The man wants to die.

53:55.650 --> 53:57.109
On my command!

54:04.951 --> 54:06.985
Break off! Break off!

54:31.519 --> 54:34.604
« Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

54:34.772 --> 54:36.481
« Achilles! Achilles!

54:36.649 --> 54:42.195

54:42.360 --> 54:43.960
Give him the battle,

54:44.600 --> 54:45.700
« we'll take the war.

54:45.710 --> 54:46.985
« Give him too many battles

54:46.990 --> 54:49.190
and the men will forget who's king.

55:03.509 --> 55:06.428
« Ajax, you need to see this.

55:08.264 --> 55:09.723
Look at him...

55:09.891 --> 55:12.601
...hogging all the glory.

55:13.728 --> 55:16.771
Row, you lazy whores, row!

55:17.023 --> 55:19.858
Greeks are dying! Row!

55:48.880 --> 55:50.780
Those men down there need help. Now!

55:51.090 --> 55:52.290
« Tecton, with me.

56:04.779 --> 56:08.114
I am Ajax, breaker of stones!

56:08.282 --> 56:11.159
Look upon me and despair!

56:11.744 --> 56:14.246
Flank! To the flank!

57:05.798 --> 57:07.048
No!

57:36.000 --> 57:39.300
« Achilles! Achilles! Achilles!

57:44.503 --> 57:47.714
Back to the city! Back to the city!

58:03.105 --> 58:06.775
The sun god is a patron of Troy,
our enemy.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.654
Take whatever treasure you can find.

58:17.912 --> 58:19.579
« With your permission, my lord.

58:24.485 --> 58:25.285
Speak.

58:25.495 --> 58:27.495
Apollo sees everything.

58:27.672 --> 58:30.465
Perhaps it is not wise to offend him.

58:54.115 --> 58:55.532
Warn the men.

58:56.701 --> 58:58.026
Wait.

01:00:49.897 --> 01:00:54.067
« You are very brave or very stupid
to come after me alone.

01:00:55.903 --> 01:00:57.570
You must be Hector.

01:01:05.788 --> 01:01:07.747
Do you know who I am?

01:01:10.751 --> 01:01:12.752
These priests weren't armed.

01:01:14.755 --> 01:01:19.133
Yes. There's no honor
in cutting old men's throats.

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:23.054
Only children and fools fight for honor.

01:01:23.222 --> 01:01:25.056
I fight for my country.

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:28.643
Fight me!

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:37.610
Why kill you now, prince of Troy...

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.737
...with no one here to see you fall?

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:54.085
Why did you come here?

01:01:54.587 --> 01:01:57.130
They'll be talking about this war
for 1,000 years.

01:01:58.257 --> 01:02:01.509
In 1,000 years, the dust from our bones
will be gone.

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:05.054
Yes, prince. But our names will remain.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.090
Go home, prince.

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.500
Drink some wine, make love to your wife.

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:21.905
Tomorrow, we'll have our war.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.577
You speak of war as if it's a game.

01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:31.539
How many wives wait at Troy's gates
for husbands they'll never see again?

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.895
Your brother can comfort them.

01:02:33.905 --> 01:02:36.105
I hear he's good at charming
other men's wives.

01:02:51.852 --> 01:02:53.519
My lord, you let him go?

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.484
It's too early in the day
for killing princes.

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.200
« Achilles! Achilles!

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.900
« Achilles! Achilles!

01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:40.910
« Achilles! Achilles!

01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.920
« Achilles! Achilles!

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.103
- Achilles.
- Ajax.

01:04:17.563 --> 01:04:22.150
You're as fearless as the gods.
I'm honored to go to war with you.

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:23.735
As am I.

01:04:25.112 --> 01:04:26.988
If you sailed slower,
the war would be over.

01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:28.350
« I'll miss the start...

01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:29.949
as long as I'm here at the end.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.150
« My lord?

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:34.328
I've got something to show you.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:55.683
The men found her...
hiding in the temple.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:57.769
They thought she'd...

01:04:58.771 --> 01:05:00.438
...amuse you.

01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:13.159
What's your name?

01:05:17.498 --> 01:05:19.165
Did you not hear me?

01:05:20.626 --> 01:05:22.543
You killed Apollo's priests.

01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:24.879
I've killed men in five countries,
never a priest.

01:05:25.047 --> 01:05:27.131
Then your men did.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.509
The sun god will have his vengeance.

01:05:30.177 --> 01:05:32.011
What's he waiting for?

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.388
The right time to strike.

01:05:36.975 --> 01:05:40.019
His priests are dead,
and his acolyte's a captive.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.780
I think your god is afraid of me.

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.640
Afraid?

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:48.194
Apollo is master of the sun.
He fears nothing.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:51.197
- Where is he?
- You're nothing but a killer!

01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:54.117
You wouldn't know anything about the gods.

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.956
I know more about the gods
than your priests.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:02.125
I've seen them.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.383
You're royalty, aren't you?

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.555
Spent years talking down to men.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:21.394
You must be royalty.

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:25.064
What's your name?

01:06:30.863 --> 01:06:33.531
Even the servants of Apollo have names.

01:06:39.413 --> 01:06:41.247
Briseis.

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:46.335
Are you afraid, Briseis?

01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:48.921
Should I be?

01:06:52.593 --> 01:06:54.093
My lord.

01:06:56.263 --> 01:06:59.015
Agamemnon requests your presence.

01:06:59.683 --> 01:07:02.476
The kings are gathering
to celebrate the victory.

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:06.647
You fought well today.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:09.775
My lord.

01:07:14.823 --> 01:07:16.866
What do you want here in Troy?

01:07:17.826 --> 01:07:19.869
You didn't come for the Spartan queen.

01:07:20.037 --> 01:07:21.787
I want what all men want.

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:23.956
I just want it more.

01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.465
You don't need to fear me, girl.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:35.676
You're the only Trojan who can say that.

01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:22.305
« King Triopas, my lord.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.520
« You have won a great victory,
my king of kings.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.555
« No one thought the Trojan beach

01:08:30.585 --> 01:08:32.285
could be captured so easily.

01:08:33.193 --> 01:08:35.528
A beautiful gift, Triopas.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.834
You will be among the first to walk
in the streets of Troy...

01:08:39.844 --> 01:08:41.444
« tomorrow.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.495
My father, Neleus, had this urn made
to commemorate his victory at Cyparisseis.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.502
I present it to you...

01:08:51.752 --> 01:08:54.546
« ...in honor of an even more
memorable victory.

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:56.381
« Thank you, old friend.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:09:00.886
Tomorrow, we'll eat supper
in the gardens of Troy.

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:11.147
Leave us.

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:22.510
War is young men dying
and old men talking.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.069
You know this.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.162
Ignore the politics.

01:09:43.596 --> 01:09:45.430
Apparently, you won some great victory.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.069
Perhaps you didn't notice.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.779
The Trojan beach
belonged to Priam in the morning.

01:09:51.438 --> 01:09:54.315
It belongs to Agamemnon in the afternoon.

01:09:54.608 --> 01:09:56.817
Have the beach.
I didn't come here for sand.

01:09:56.985 --> 01:09:58.277
No.

01:09:58.445 --> 01:10:02.015
You came here because you want your name
to last through the ages.

01:10:04.743 --> 01:10:06.827
A great victory was won today.

01:10:08.246 --> 01:10:09.946
But that victory is not yours.

01:10:10.707 --> 01:10:13.125
« Kings did not kneel to Achilles.

01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:16.087
Kings did not pay homage to Achilles.

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:18.480
Perhaps the kings
were too far behind to see.

01:10:18.690 --> 01:10:20.049
Soldiers won the battle.

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.301
History remembers kings!

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:24.553
Not soldiers.

01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:29.225
Tomorrow, we'll batter down
the gates of Troy.

01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:32.144
« I'll build monuments
on every island of Greece.

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:35.398

First, you need the victory.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:56.127
Your men sacked the temple of Apollo, yes?

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:58.003
You want gold? Take it.

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:01.257
It's my gift to honor your courage.
Take what you wish.

01:11:01.425 --> 01:11:03.342
I already have.

01:11:08.515 --> 01:11:09.849
Haemon!

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.235
The spoils of war.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:24.010
No argument with you,
but if you don't release her,

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:26.020
you'll never see home again.

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.217
- Decide.
- Guards!

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:31.996
Stop!

01:11:33.165 --> 01:11:35.124
Too many people have died today.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.962
If killing is your only talent,
that's your curse.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:43.340
I don't want anyone dying for me.

01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:57.255
Mighty Achilles, silenced by a slave girl.

01:12:01.067 --> 01:12:05.362
Tonight, I'll have her give me a bath.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:07.698
« And then...

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:10.618
- ...who knows?
- You sack of wine!

Before my time is done,
I will look down on your corpse and smile.

01:13:33.827 --> 01:13:37.788
If they want a war,
we will give them a war.

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:43.711
I would match the best of Troy
against the best of Greece any day.

01:13:44.421 --> 01:13:48.090
The best of Greece outnumber
the best of Troy two to one.

01:13:48.258 --> 01:13:50.175
So, what do you suggest?

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.969
We surrender our city?

01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:56.181
We allow the Greeks to slaughter our men?
Rape our wives?

01:13:56.349 --> 01:13:58.100
« I suggest diplomacy.

01:13:58.268 --> 01:14:00.352
The Greeks came here for one thing.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:04.565
Let's be honest, my friends.
Trojans are now burning on the pyre...

01:14:05.442 --> 01:14:09.528
...because of one youthful indiscretion.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.031
Glaucus.

01:14:12.532 --> 01:14:16.285
You have fought with me for 40 years.
Can we win this war?

01:14:16.453 --> 01:14:19.163
Our walls have never been breached.

01:14:19.372 --> 01:14:21.707
We have the finest archers in the world.

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:23.834
And we have Hector...

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.445
...whose men would fight
the shades of Tartarus

01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:28.155
if he commanded.

01:14:28.715 --> 01:14:31.250
Yes, we can win.

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:43.604
I spoke with two farmers today.

01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:47.040
« They saw an eagle
flying with a serpent

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:49.050
clutched in its talons.

01:14:49.611 --> 01:14:52.655
This is a sign from Apollo.

01:14:52.947 --> 01:14:55.074
We will win a great victory tomorrow.

01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.784
Bird signs.

01:14:56.993 --> 01:14:59.828
You want to plan a strategy
based on bird signs.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:01.538
« Hector, show respect.

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:06.752
When Archeptolemus prophesied
four years of drought we dug deeper wells.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:10.005
The drought came
and we had water to drink.

01:15:10.173 --> 01:15:13.050
The high priest is a servant of the gods.

01:15:13.218 --> 01:15:15.219
And I am a servant of Troy.

01:15:17.013 --> 01:15:19.932
I've always honored the gods, Father.
You know that.

01:15:20.100 --> 01:15:23.644
But today I fought a Greek
who desecrated the statue of Apollo.

01:15:23.812 --> 01:15:26.522
Apollo didn't strike the man down.

01:15:27.607 --> 01:15:30.025
The gods won't fight this war for us.

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:33.112
There won't be a war.

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:40.119
This is not a conflict of nations.

01:15:40.328 --> 01:15:42.579
It is a dispute between two men.

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:46.208
I don't want to see another Trojan die
because of me.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.200
Paris.

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.360
Tomorrow morning,

01:15:50.370 --> 01:15:52.570
I will challenge Menelaus
for the right to Helen.

01:15:53.130 --> 01:15:54.980
The winner will take her home.

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:58.390
The loser will burn before nightfall.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:12.818
Does he have a chance?

01:16:23.788 --> 01:16:25.330
« Father...

01:16:26.541 --> 01:16:29.209
...I'm sorry for the pain I've caused you.

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:31.962
Do you love her?

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:38.844
You are a great king because
you love your country so much.

01:16:39.387 --> 01:16:41.221
Every blade of grass.

01:16:42.307 --> 01:16:44.183
Every grain of sand.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:45.934
Every rock in the river.

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:49.271
You love all of Troy.

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:54.026
That is the way I love Helen.

01:16:57.447 --> 01:17:00.532
« I've fought many wars in my time.

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:05.537
Some were fought for land,
some for power, some for glory.

01:17:07.415 --> 01:17:13.086
I suppose fighting for love makes
more sense than all the rest.

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:16.173
But I won't be the one fighting.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.220
The sword of Troy.

01:17:21.930 --> 01:17:25.599
My father carried this sword,
and his father before him...

01:17:25.767 --> 01:17:28.393
...all the way back
to the founding of Troy.

01:17:28.561 --> 01:17:32.731
The history of our people
was written with this sword.

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:37.236
Carry it with you tomorrow.

01:17:40.824 --> 01:17:44.159
The spirit of Troy is in that sword.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:49.289
So long as a Trojan carries it...

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.918
« ...our people have a future.

01:17:57.048 --> 01:18:00.259
The man who killed Tecton
outside Apollo's temple...

01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:03.971
...I've never seen a spear
thrown like that.

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:06.723
An impossible throw.

01:18:10.144 --> 01:18:12.437
« He has no idea what's happening.

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:13.647
« Thank the gods.

01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:17.109
Don't go tomorrow.

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:20.863
- Please don't go.
- Paris fights tomorrow, not me.

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:24.330
Fifty thousand Greeks didn't cross the sea
to watch your brother fight.

01:18:25.140 --> 01:18:26.398
You know this.

01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:30.622
You'd make a fine general, my love.

01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:35.294
You've been fighting your whole life.
Let other men do battle this time.

01:18:35.628 --> 01:18:40.299
You know I don't want to fight.
I want to see my son grow tall.

01:18:40.466 --> 01:18:42.593
« I want to see the girls
chasing after him.

01:18:43.177 --> 01:18:44.928
Just like they chased his father.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:49.850
He's much more handsome than I ever was.

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:53.979
I must see Paris.

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:55.681
I lost...

01:18:56.691 --> 01:18:58.692
...seven brothers...

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.145
...in the Spartan wars.

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:05.991
You'd think I'd be good at losing by now.

01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:10.579
I can't lose you.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:14.291
I won't survive.

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:41.443
Wait.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:43.862
Wait!

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:50.702
Helen, what are you doing?

01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:52.996
- Let me go.
- No.

01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:02.381
I saw them burn.

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:06.343
I saw them burning on the pyres.

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:10.222
That's my fault.

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.017
It is. You know it is.

01:20:15.937 --> 01:20:17.729
All those widows.

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:21.108
I still hear them screaming.

01:20:22.777 --> 01:20:25.946
Their husbands died because I'm here.

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:28.532
I'm going down to the ships.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:30.367
No, you're not.

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:33.578
I'm giving myself back to Menelaus.

01:20:33.913 --> 01:20:35.789
He can do what he wants.

01:20:35.957 --> 01:20:38.125
Kill me, make me his slave, I don't care.

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:39.751
Anything is better than this.

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:41.545
It's too late for that.

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:44.756
Do you think Agamemnon cares
about his brother's marriage?

01:20:44.924 --> 01:20:47.342
This is about power. Not love.

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:50.345
Paris is going to fight in the morning.

01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:53.974
- Yes.
- Menelaus will kill him.

01:20:54.142 --> 01:20:55.475
I won't let that happen.

01:20:56.102 --> 01:20:58.103
- It's his decision.
- No.

01:20:58.438 --> 01:21:01.106
I can't ask anyone to fight for me.

01:21:02.567 --> 01:21:04.776
I'm no longer queen of Sparta.

01:21:07.155 --> 01:21:09.406
You're a princess of Troy now...

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:13.326
...and my brother needs you tonight.

01:21:47.111 --> 01:21:48.779
My lord.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:54.826
The army is marching.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:58.163
Let them march. We stay.

01:21:59.332 --> 01:22:00.499
But the men are ready.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:03.502
We stay till Agamemnon groans
to have Achilles back.

01:22:05.171 --> 01:22:06.505
As you wish.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.566
Are you ready to fight?

01:22:27.777 --> 01:22:28.777
I am.

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:31.363
Are you ready to kill? To take life?

01:22:41.332 --> 01:22:45.168
At night, I see their faces,
all the men I've killed.

01:22:46.295 --> 01:22:49.256
They're standing there on the far bank
of the River Styx.

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:54.052
They're waiting for me.

01:22:56.180 --> 01:22:58.181
They say, "Welcome, brother."

01:23:05.398 --> 01:23:07.315
We men are wretched things.

01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:16.366
I taught you how to fight,
but I never taught you why to fight.

01:23:16.826 --> 01:23:18.076
I fight for you.

01:23:18.244 --> 01:23:20.245
Who will you fight for when I'm gone?

01:23:23.082 --> 01:23:26.293
Soldiers, they fight for kings
they've never even met.

01:23:27.295 --> 01:23:30.046
They do what they're told,
die when they're told to.

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:32.841
Soldiers obey.

01:23:40.183 --> 01:23:43.435
Don't waste your life following
some fool's orders.

01:23:47.857 --> 01:23:49.074
Go.

01:25:14.277 --> 01:25:16.236
Are you sure you want to do this?

01:25:17.363 --> 01:25:19.072
I started this war.

01:25:34.714 --> 01:25:36.631
Helen...

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:39.259
...sit with me.

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:53.023
All my life I have prayed
against this day.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.067
Yes, my king.

01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:59.237
Call me Father, dear child.

01:26:02.992 --> 01:26:05.243
Forgive me, Father...

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:07.996
...for bringing this.

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:11.041
I blame you for nothing.

01:26:11.375 --> 01:26:15.253
Everything is in the hands of the gods.

01:26:15.588 --> 01:26:17.172
Besides...

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:21.926
...how could I blame anyone
for falling in love with Paris?

01:28:33.934 --> 01:28:35.727
« Prepare to halt!

01:28:35.895 --> 01:28:37.645
« Prepare to halt!

01:28:37.980 --> 01:28:39.564
« Halt!

01:28:58.918 --> 01:29:00.585
Move.

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.430
Menelaus is a bull.

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:17.018
He'll charge you,
but keep your distance and use your speed.

01:29:18.437 --> 01:29:19.729
Brother...

01:29:20.523 --> 01:29:22.690
...you don't have to do this.

01:29:44.080 --> 01:29:46.716
I see you're not hiding
behind your high walls

01:29:47.126 --> 01:29:48.591
Valiant of you.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:51.344
I'll advised, but valiant.

01:29:51.512 --> 01:29:55.265
You come here uninvited.
Go back to your ships and go home.

01:29:55.432 --> 01:29:57.433
We've come too far, Prince Hector.

01:29:57.601 --> 01:30:00.061
Prince? What prince?

01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:03.064
What son of a king would accept
a man's hospitality...

01:30:03.232 --> 01:30:04.916
« ...eat his food, drink his wine,

01:30:04.967 --> 01:30:07.619
then steal his wife
in the middle of the night?

01:30:07.736 --> 01:30:09.821
The sun was shining
when your wife left you.

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:14.742
She's up there, watching, isn't she? Good.

01:30:14.910 --> 01:30:17.161
I want her to watch you die.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.497
Not yet, brother.

01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:23.376
Look around you, Hector.

01:30:23.544 --> 01:30:27.130
I brought all the warriors of Greece
to your shores.

01:30:27.298 --> 01:30:29.299
You can still save Troy, young prince.

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:30.925
I have two wishes.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:34.429
If you grant them,
no more of your people need die.

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.599
First, you must give Helen back
to my brother.

01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:41.352
Second, Troy must submit to my command...

01:30:41.604 --> 01:30:44.230
...to fight for me whenever I call.

01:30:44.398 --> 01:30:47.442
You want me to look upon your army
and tremble?

01:30:49.737 --> 01:30:51.237
Well, I see them.

01:30:51.739 --> 01:30:56.451
I see 50,000 men brought here
to fight for one man's greed.

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:01.706
Careful, boy.

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.792
My mercy has limits.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:07.378
And I've seen the limits of your mercy.

01:31:07.546 --> 01:31:12.008
And I tell you now, no son of Troy
will ever submit to a foreign ruler.

01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:16.387
Then every son of Troy shall die.

01:31:19.683 --> 01:31:21.559
There is another way.

01:31:23.729 --> 01:31:27.940
I love Helen.
I won't give her up and neither will you.

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:29.776
So let us fight our own battle.

01:31:30.027 --> 01:31:33.738
The winner takes Helen home.
And let that be the end of it.

01:31:33.906 --> 01:31:37.575
A brave offer, but not enough.

01:31:39.078 --> 01:31:40.828
Let me kill this little peacock.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:45.750
I didn't come here for your pretty wife.
I came here for Troy.

01:31:45.918 --> 01:31:48.211
I came for my honor.

01:31:48.379 --> 01:31:50.797
His every breath insults me.

01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.480
Let me kill him.

01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:54.790
When he's lying in the dust,
signal to attack.

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:58.096
You'll have your city.
I'll have my revenge.

01:32:03.686 --> 01:32:05.103
So be it.

01:32:09.441 --> 01:32:13.736
I accept your challenge.
And tonight, I'll drink to your bones.

01:32:23.372 --> 01:32:26.457
« - My lord.
« - Back to the line!

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.433
Make him swing and miss. He'll tire.

01:32:45.144 --> 01:32:46.477
Brother...

01:32:46.645 --> 01:32:49.731
...if I fall, tell Helen... Tell her...

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:51.649
I will.

01:32:51.817 --> 01:32:53.901
Don't let Menelaus hurt her. If he...

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:57.488
You think of your sword and his sword
and nothing else.

01:34:09.144 --> 01:34:10.770
Get up.

01:34:11.188 --> 01:34:12.897
Come on.

01:34:58.193 --> 01:34:59.610
See the crows?

01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:03.739
They never tasted prince before.

01:35:38.108 --> 01:35:42.486
Is this what you left me for?

01:35:42.650 --> 01:35:43.450
« Fight!

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:45.990
Fight me!

01:35:47.159 --> 01:35:48.367
You coward!

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:49.827
Fight me!

01:35:49.995 --> 01:35:52.371
We have a pact! Fight!

01:35:52.915 --> 01:35:55.875
Fight him, son. Fight him.

01:35:56.043 --> 01:35:59.837
« - Fight me!
- The Trojans have violated the agreement!

01:36:00.005 --> 01:36:02.548
Prepare for battle!

01:36:04.301 --> 01:36:05.635
This is not honor!

01:36:05.886 --> 01:36:08.346
This is not worthy of royalty!

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:11.891
If he doesn't fight, Troy is doomed.

01:36:12.809 --> 01:36:14.018
Paris.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.400
No.

01:36:15.520 --> 01:36:17.480
No. No.

01:36:18.231 --> 01:36:19.523
The fight is over.

01:36:19.691 --> 01:36:21.859
The fight is not over.

01:36:22.027 --> 01:36:23.736
Stand back, Prince Hector.

01:36:23.904 --> 01:36:26.572
I'll kill him at your feet. I don't care.

01:36:26.740 --> 01:36:28.032
He is my brother.

01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:24.981
Paris!

01:37:34.570 --> 01:37:35.570
Go!

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.800
Go!

01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:44.859
Get inside, Paris!

01:37:45.444 --> 01:37:46.736
Archers!

01:37:50.157 --> 01:37:53.367
- Our men are too close to the walls.
- Pull back.

01:37:53.535 --> 01:37:55.244
Pull back, you fool!

01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:56.746
For Troy!

01:37:56.913 --> 01:37:58.039
For Troy!

01:38:24.566 --> 01:38:26.734
- Now!
- Loose!

01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:59.767
Get them in line!

01:39:06.191 --> 01:39:09.151
Get the men back into lines!

01:39:09.319 --> 01:39:11.695
Front line, push!

01:40:21.057 --> 01:40:23.893
So you're the best of the Trojans.

01:41:39.261 --> 01:41:40.761
Forward.

01:41:40.929 --> 01:41:42.179
Forward!

01:41:58.613 --> 01:41:59.905
Forward!

01:42:14.838 --> 01:42:17.214
Apollonians! Now!

01:42:31.187 --> 01:42:32.521
Prince Hector!

01:42:40.697 --> 01:42:42.031
We need to retreat!

01:42:42.991 --> 01:42:45.200
« My army's never lost a battle yet!

01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:47.870
You won't have an army
if you don't fall back!

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:58.297
Back to the ships!

01:42:58.465 --> 01:43:00.174
- Back to the ships!
- Retreat!

01:43:00.342 --> 01:43:01.342
- Back!
- Retreat!

01:43:01.509 --> 01:43:03.302
Go back!

01:43:11.478 --> 01:43:13.312
Back. Back to the ships!

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:21.505
Fall back!

01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:23.182
Men, fall back!

01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:24.900
Halt!

01:44:31.641 --> 01:44:33.058
Halt!

01:44:33.268 --> 01:44:34.726
But we have them on the run!

01:44:34.978 --> 01:44:37.187
We're in range of their archers.

01:44:37.355 --> 01:44:39.231
Have our men gather our fallen.

01:44:39.399 --> 01:44:42.359
Send an emissary to them.
They can collect their dead.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.220
Would they have done the same for us?

01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.890
Go!

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:49.800
Back!

01:44:50.452 --> 01:44:52.161
Fall back into line!

01:45:56.851 --> 01:45:59.061
Before I leave...

01:45:59.312 --> 01:46:02.856
...I will burn their city to the ground.

01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:06.860
Brother, I promise you that.

01:46:35.348 --> 01:46:40.602
They're laughing at me in Troy.
Drunk with victory!

01:46:40.979 --> 01:46:43.981
They think I'll sail home at first light.

01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.482
Maybe we should.

01:46:45.650 --> 01:46:46.550
Flee?

01:46:46.860 --> 01:46:48.160
Like a whipped dog?

01:46:48.194 --> 01:46:51.822
The men believe we came here
for Menelaus' wife.

01:46:53.074 --> 01:46:54.741
Won't be needing her anymore.

01:46:54.951 --> 01:46:58.078
My brother's blood still wets the sand,
and you insult him!

01:46:58.288 --> 01:47:00.914
It's no insult to say a dead man is dead.

01:47:01.124 --> 01:47:04.209
If we leave now, we lose all credibility.

01:47:04.420 --> 01:47:06.640
The Trojans can beat us so easily.

01:47:07.050 --> 01:47:08.950
How long before the Hittites invade?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:10.300
If we stay,

01:47:11.210 --> 01:47:13.210
we stay here for the right reasons.

01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:15.846
To protect Greece, not your pride.

01:47:16.014 --> 01:47:18.765
Your private battle with Achilles
is destroying us.

01:47:18.933 --> 01:47:20.183
Achilles is one man.

01:47:20.351 --> 01:47:22.769
Hector is one man.

01:47:23.354 --> 01:47:24.771
Look what he did to us today.

01:47:24.981 --> 01:47:28.942
Hector fights for his country!
Achilles fights only for himself!

01:47:29.110 --> 01:47:33.864
I don't care about the man's allegiance.
I care about his ability to win battles.

01:47:34.115 --> 01:47:35.657
« He's right.

01:47:35.825 --> 01:47:37.284
The men's morale is weak.

01:47:37.452 --> 01:47:40.579
Weak? They're ready to swim home.

01:47:40.747 --> 01:47:45.667
Even if I could make peace with Achilles,
the man won't listen to me!

01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:50.005
He's as likely to spear me
as to speak to me!

01:47:51.549 --> 01:47:53.008
I'll talk to him.

01:47:53.593 --> 01:47:55.010
He'll want the girl back.

01:47:55.553 --> 01:47:56.887
He can have that damn girl.

01:48:00.725 --> 01:48:01.933
I haven't touched her.

01:48:02.894 --> 01:48:04.186
Where is she?

01:48:05.730 --> 01:48:07.397
I gave her to the men.

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.071
They need some amusement after today.

01:48:17.909 --> 01:48:20.202
Come on, give the bitch to me!

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:22.204
Who's first?

01:48:22.955 --> 01:48:24.498
Trojan whore!

01:48:24.666 --> 01:48:26.583
What's this? A virgin's robe?

01:48:26.918 --> 01:48:29.170
You won't be needing that for much longer!

01:48:29.221 --> 01:48:30.070
Hold her.

01:48:34.926 --> 01:48:37.803
Come on. Come on. Hold her down.

01:49:11.212 --> 01:49:13.046
Are you hurt?

01:49:19.178 --> 01:49:21.471
I watched you fight them.
You have courage.

01:49:21.640 --> 01:49:23.644
To fight back when people attack me?

01:49:24.254 --> 01:49:26.254
Dog has that kind of courage.

01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:51.001
Eat.

01:49:59.635 --> 01:50:01.678
I've known men like you my whole life.

01:50:03.389 --> 01:50:04.514
No, you haven't.

01:50:04.682 --> 01:50:07.017
You think you're so different
from 1,000 others?

01:50:07.890 --> 01:50:09.668
Soldiers understand nothing but war.

01:50:10.678 --> 01:50:11.978
Peace confuses them.

01:50:12.023 --> 01:50:14.357
- And you hate these soldiers.
- I pity them.

01:50:15.318 --> 01:50:18.028
Trojan soldiers died trying
to protect you.

01:50:18.529 --> 01:50:21.239
Perhaps they deserve more than your pity.

01:50:24.202 --> 01:50:25.827
Why did you choose this life?

01:50:26.245 --> 01:50:28.538
- What life?
- To be a great warrior.

01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:32.193
I chose nothing.

01:50:33.103 --> 01:50:35.103
I was born, and this is what I am.

01:50:36.339 --> 01:50:39.424
And you? Why did you choose to love a god?

01:50:40.384 --> 01:50:43.386
I think you'll find the romance one-sided.

01:50:45.973 --> 01:50:47.557
Do you enjoy provoking me?

01:50:49.519 --> 01:50:51.561
You've dedicated your life to the gods.

01:50:51.720 --> 01:50:54.420
Zeus, god of thunder.
Athena, goddess of wisdom.

01:50:54.630 --> 01:50:55.530
You serve them.

01:50:55.566 --> 01:50:58.068
- Yes, of course.
- And Ares, god of war?

01:50:58.236 --> 01:51:01.238
Who blankets his bed
with the skin of men he's killed?

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:05.826
All the gods are to be feared
and respected.

01:51:17.088 --> 01:51:18.672
I'll tell you a secret...

01:51:19.257 --> 01:51:21.925
...something they don't teach you
in your temple.

01:51:32.436 --> 01:51:34.813
The gods envy us.

01:51:36.524 --> 01:51:38.608
They envy us because we're mortal.

01:51:40.152 --> 01:51:42.988
« Because any moment might be our last.

01:51:43.281 --> 01:51:46.575
Everything's more beautiful
because we're doomed.

01:51:47.785 --> 01:51:50.745
« You will never be lovelier
than you are now.

01:51:55.042 --> 01:51:56.793
We will never be here again.

01:52:07.555 --> 01:52:09.556
I thought you were a dumb brute.

01:52:13.144 --> 01:52:15.145
I could have forgiven a dumb brute.

01:52:39.503 --> 01:52:40.712
Do it.

01:52:47.261 --> 01:52:48.803
Nothing is easier.

01:52:48.971 --> 01:52:50.180
Aren't you afraid?

01:52:52.475 --> 01:52:55.762
Everyone dies.
Today or 50 years from now.

01:52:56.072 --> 01:52:57.572
What does it matter?

01:53:01.859 --> 01:53:03.352
Do it.

01:53:05.237 --> 01:53:07.405
You'll kill more men if I don't kill you.

01:53:07.573 --> 01:53:09.199
Many.

01:54:44.128 --> 01:54:45.628
My lord, there's...

01:55:00.478 --> 01:55:04.230
Tell the men to start loading the ship.
We're going home.

01:55:08.194 --> 01:55:09.786
« Gather the stores.

01:55:10.154 --> 01:55:11.988
« Prepare the ship.

01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:14.657
« Prepare the ship.

01:55:14.950 --> 01:55:17.368
Agamemnon is a proud man.

01:55:18.454 --> 01:55:20.830
But he knows when he's made a mistake.

01:55:20.998 --> 01:55:23.249
The man sends you to make his apologies?

01:55:25.377 --> 01:55:28.129
What are you doing enthralled
to that pig of a king?

01:55:29.131 --> 01:55:31.382
The world seems simple to you,
my friend...

01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:35.053
...but when you're a king,
very few choices are simple.

01:55:37.056 --> 01:55:39.891
Ithaca cannot afford an enemy
like Agamemnon.

01:55:40.059 --> 01:55:41.726
Are we supposed to fear him?

01:55:41.890 --> 01:55:43.990
You don't fear anyone.
That's your problem.

01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:46.300
Fear... is useful.

01:55:49.985 --> 01:55:51.444
We need you back.

01:55:51.695 --> 01:55:53.446
Greece needs you.

01:55:54.365 --> 01:55:57.117
Greece got along fine before I was born.

01:55:57.284 --> 01:55:59.536
Greece will be Greece long after I'm dead.

01:55:59.703 --> 01:56:01.746
I'm not talking about the land.

01:56:01.914 --> 01:56:04.165
The men need you.

01:56:07.628 --> 01:56:09.212
Stay, Achilles.

01:56:10.214 --> 01:56:11.756
You were born for this war.

01:56:15.678 --> 01:56:17.262
Things are less simple today.

01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:23.560
Women have a way of complicating things.

01:56:27.273 --> 01:56:30.567
Of all the kings of Greece,
I respect you the most.

01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.902
But in this war, you're a servant.

01:56:33.070 --> 01:56:36.239
Sometimes you have to serve
in order to lead.

01:56:37.867 --> 01:56:40.743
I hope you understand that one day.

01:56:45.958 --> 01:56:47.208
We're going home?

01:56:51.755 --> 01:56:53.006
We sail in the morning.

01:56:53.299 --> 01:56:56.759
Greeks are being slaughtered.
We can't just sail away.

01:56:56.927 --> 01:57:00.763
If it's fighting you still long for,
there will always be another war.

01:57:00.931 --> 01:57:02.348
These are our countrymen.

01:57:02.933 --> 01:57:06.102
I ate, laughed, mourned with these men
while you hid in your tent.

01:57:07.188 --> 01:57:10.190
« You betray all of Greece
just to see Agamemnon fall.

01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:16.237
Someone has to lose.

01:57:17.323 --> 01:57:21.409
In all my years to come,
may my heart never turn as black as yours!

01:57:21.702 --> 01:57:23.953
We sail in the morning!

01:57:29.877 --> 01:57:32.295
The omens are gathering.

01:57:32.463 --> 01:57:34.297
The directive is clear.

01:57:34.465 --> 01:57:36.716
Fight for your country,
that's the only directive.

01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:39.200
« Last time the high priest spoke to us,

01:57:39.210 --> 01:57:41.910
he prophesied a great victory for Troy.

01:57:41.972 --> 01:57:45.725
We won a great victory. Let him speak.

01:57:46.352 --> 01:57:48.811
What course of action do you recommend?

01:57:49.104 --> 01:57:51.481
The gods favor our cause.

01:57:51.640 --> 01:57:53.740
Now is the time to destroy the Greek army.

01:57:56.487 --> 01:57:57.779
Glaucus?

01:57:58.656 --> 01:58:00.949
Their morale is battered.

01:58:01.110 --> 01:58:02.410
Hit them now.

01:58:02.825 --> 01:58:04.125
Hit them hard.

01:58:04.495 --> 01:58:06.329
And they will run.

01:58:09.166 --> 01:58:12.794
I must admit, I overestimated the Greeks.

01:58:13.504 --> 01:58:16.214
They lack discipline and courage.

01:58:23.340 --> 01:58:25.535
The Myrmidons didn't fight yesterday.

01:58:25.850 --> 01:58:27.750
There must be dissension among the Greeks.

01:58:27.810 --> 01:58:30.436
But if we attack their ships,
we will unify them.

01:58:31.188 --> 01:58:33.189
If they decide to attack us, let them.

01:58:33.357 --> 01:58:36.276
Our walls can't be breached.
We'll beat them back again.

01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:42.907
Yesterday, the Greeks underestimated us.

01:58:43.867 --> 01:58:46.035
We should not return the favor.

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:02.510
You're confident about the meaning
of these omens?

01:59:02.678 --> 01:59:06.347
The desecration of his temple
angers Apollo.

01:59:06.849 --> 01:59:09.809
The gods have cursed the Greeks.

01:59:10.311 --> 01:59:14.105
Two of their kings
have already gone down to the dust.

01:59:19.236 --> 01:59:22.071
Prepare the army. We attack at daybreak.

01:59:22.239 --> 01:59:23.740
« Father.

01:59:24.742 --> 01:59:26.701
We're making a mistake.

01:59:29.204 --> 01:59:30.496
Prepare the army.

01:59:48.557 --> 01:59:50.141
Come on.

02:00:17.795 --> 02:00:19.921
Am I still your captive?

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:24.342
You're my guest.

02:00:26.970 --> 02:00:30.098
In Troy, guests can leave
whenever they want.

02:00:30.265 --> 02:00:31.933
You should leave, then.

02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:40.900
Would you leave this all behind?

02:00:45.322 --> 02:00:46.989
Would you leave Troy?

02:03:47.504 --> 02:03:49.338
Hold those barricades!

02:04:10.193 --> 02:04:12.153
Archers to the rear.

02:04:21.538 --> 02:04:23.706
Achilles.

02:04:46.855 --> 02:04:48.689
Achilles.

02:04:51.568 --> 02:04:53.194
Now!

02:05:02.329 --> 02:05:03.746
Forward!

02:07:58.129 --> 02:07:59.755
Enough for one day.

02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:03.175
Yes.

02:08:04.678 --> 02:08:06.178
Back to the ships!

02:08:06.346 --> 02:08:08.764
« Back to the ships!

02:08:10.600 --> 02:08:12.309
It was his cousin.

02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:18.274
« To Troy!

02:08:19.192 --> 02:08:21.360
« Back to the city!

02:08:22.279 --> 02:08:23.654
« To Troy!

02:08:25.782 --> 02:08:27.950
We were going to sail home today.

02:08:30.787 --> 02:08:33.455
I don't think anyone's sailing home now.

02:08:54.185 --> 02:08:55.644
Achilles.

02:09:11.161 --> 02:09:12.995
You violated my command.

02:09:13.780 --> 02:09:14.680
« No, my lord.

02:09:15.690 --> 02:09:17.390
There was a mistake.

02:09:18.001 --> 02:09:20.544
I ordered the Myrmidons to stand down.

02:09:20.837 --> 02:09:22.963
You led them into combat.

02:09:27.844 --> 02:09:31.722
I didn't lead them, my lord.
We thought you did.

02:09:39.481 --> 02:09:40.731
Where's Patroclus?

02:09:43.693 --> 02:09:45.402
Patroclus!

02:09:45.862 --> 02:09:48.155
« We thought he was you, my lord.

02:09:50.617 --> 02:09:56.372
He wore your armor, your shield,
your greaves, your helmet.

02:09:57.290 --> 02:09:59.083
« He even moved like you.

02:09:59.876 --> 02:10:01.961
Where is he?

02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:06.400
Where?

02:10:06.810 --> 02:10:08.310
He's dead, my lord.

02:10:08.718 --> 02:10:10.219
Hector cut his throat.

02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.460
Don't. Don't.

02:10:56.266 --> 02:10:58.017
Where are you taking me?

02:11:03.815 --> 02:11:05.774
Do you remember how to get here?

02:11:06.359 --> 02:11:07.985
Yes.

02:11:15.535 --> 02:11:18.579
The next time you come here,
follow the tunnel.

02:11:18.747 --> 02:11:21.832
There are no turns, so you can't get lost.
Just keep walking.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:23.417
Why?

02:11:23.918 --> 02:11:26.420
When you get to the end,
you'll be by the river.

02:11:26.588 --> 02:11:29.006
Follow the river until you get
to Mount Ida.

02:11:29.841 --> 02:11:32.217
The Greeks won't go that far inland.

02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:34.000
Hector.

02:11:35.346 --> 02:11:37.014
Why are you telling me this?

02:11:42.604 --> 02:11:44.063
- If I die...
- No.

02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:47.483
If I die, I don't know how long
the city will stand.

02:11:47.901 --> 02:11:49.068
Don't say that.

02:11:49.235 --> 02:11:51.487
If the Greeks get inside the walls,
it's over.

02:11:52.197 --> 02:11:55.616
They'll kill all the men,
throw the babies from the city walls.

02:11:55.784 --> 02:11:58.160
- Please.
- The women, they'll take as slaves.

02:11:58.328 --> 02:12:00.996
That, for you, will be worse than dying.

02:12:01.247 --> 02:12:03.957
Why are you saying such things?

02:12:06.836 --> 02:12:08.796
Because I want you to be ready.

02:12:11.170 --> 02:12:12.670
I want you to get our boy,

02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.300
and I want you to bring him here.

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:18.940
You save as many people as you can,
but you get here.

02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:20.850
And you run.

02:12:22.519 --> 02:12:23.727
Do you understand?

02:12:31.069 --> 02:12:32.820
I killed a boy today.

02:12:34.739 --> 02:12:36.406
And he was young.

02:12:37.575 --> 02:12:39.409
He was much too young.

02:13:14.571 --> 02:13:17.406
That boy has just saved this war for us.

02:15:05.056 --> 02:15:07.224
- Eudorus.
- My lord.

02:15:07.392 --> 02:15:09.184
I need my armor.

02:16:10.079 --> 02:16:11.413
No.

02:16:12.957 --> 02:16:14.291
Don't go!

02:16:15.168 --> 02:16:17.085
Rope!

02:16:17.253 --> 02:16:19.788
Hector's my cousin. He's a good man.

02:16:20.173 --> 02:16:22.966
Don't fight him. Please don't fight him.

02:16:23.384 --> 02:16:24.602
Please.

02:17:41.838 --> 02:17:43.171
No.

02:18:09.073 --> 02:18:11.074
Hector!

02:18:17.290 --> 02:18:18.999
Hector!

02:18:26.924 --> 02:18:28.884
Hector!

02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:35.389
Hector!

02:18:39.312 --> 02:18:41.271
Father...

02:18:41.439 --> 02:18:43.815
...forgive me for any offenses.

02:18:45.692 --> 02:18:47.943
I've served you as best as I could.

02:18:48.529 --> 02:18:50.197
« Hector!

02:18:54.451 --> 02:18:56.870
May the gods be with you.

02:19:01.250 --> 02:19:02.459
Hector.

02:19:05.254 --> 02:19:08.590
No father ever had a better son.

02:19:15.263 --> 02:19:17.147
« Hector!

02:19:18.726 --> 02:19:20.352
Apollo guard you, my prince.

02:19:27.610 --> 02:19:29.027
You're the best man I know.

02:19:35.284 --> 02:19:37.118
You're a prince of Troy.

02:19:37.912 --> 02:19:39.454
I know you'll make me proud.

02:19:47.254 --> 02:19:49.523
« Hector!

02:20:06.941 --> 02:20:09.025
Remember what I told you.

02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.320
You don't have to go.

02:20:12.130 --> 02:20:13.030
You don't.

02:20:13.114 --> 02:20:14.906
You remember what I told you.

02:20:33.259 --> 02:20:35.677
« Hector!

02:20:51.193 --> 02:20:53.578
« Hector!

02:22:07.770 --> 02:22:10.438
I've seen this moment in my dreams.

02:22:12.608 --> 02:22:13.983
I'll make a pact with you.

02:22:14.944 --> 02:22:16.986
With the gods as our witnesses...

02:22:17.154 --> 02:22:19.458
...let us pledge that
the winner will allow

02:22:19.509 --> 02:22:21.916
the loser all the proper funeral rituals.

02:22:22.034 --> 02:22:25.036
There are no pacts between lions and men.

02:22:33.045 --> 02:22:35.338
Now you know who you're fighting.

02:22:43.848 --> 02:22:46.683
I thought it was you
I was fighting yesterday.

02:22:47.010 --> 02:22:48.510
And I wish it had been you.

02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:51.200
But I gave the dead boy
the honor he deserved.

02:22:51.210 --> 02:22:53.210
You gave him the honor of your sword.

02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:57.068
You won't have eyes tonight.
You won't have ears or a tongue.

02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:59.480
« You'll wander the underworld,
blind, deaf, and dumb,

02:22:59.500 --> 02:23:01.200
and all the dead will know:

02:23:01.615 --> 02:23:05.326
This is Hector, the fool who thought
he killed Achilles.

02:25:03.404 --> 02:25:04.696
Get up, prince of Troy.

02:25:07.324 --> 02:25:10.285
Get up. I won't let a stone take my glory.

02:28:43.123 --> 02:28:44.999
You lost your cousin.

02:28:46.835 --> 02:28:48.669
Now you've taken mine.

02:28:52.132 --> 02:28:53.716
When does it end?

02:28:55.761 --> 02:28:57.303
It never ends.

02:29:57.239 --> 02:29:58.781
Who are you?

02:29:58.949 --> 02:30:04.829
I have endured what no one
on earth has endured before.

02:30:05.497 --> 02:30:10.793
I kissed the hands of the man
who killed my son.

02:30:17.926 --> 02:30:19.594
Priam?

02:30:21.138 --> 02:30:22.513
How did you get in here?

02:30:22.681 --> 02:30:26.642
I know my own country
better than the Greeks, I think.

02:30:31.398 --> 02:30:33.816
You're a brave man.

02:30:36.612 --> 02:30:39.780
I could have your head on a spit
in the blink of an eye.

02:30:40.157 --> 02:30:43.951
Do you really think
death frightens me now?

02:30:45.704 --> 02:30:48.289
I watched my eldest son die...

02:30:48.457 --> 02:30:52.335
...watched you drag his body
behind your chariot.

02:30:55.547 --> 02:30:57.715
Give him back to me.

02:30:58.800 --> 02:31:03.304
He deserves the honor of a proper burial.
You know that.

02:31:04.264 --> 02:31:06.474
Give him to me.

02:31:07.392 --> 02:31:09.101
He killed my cousin.

02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:11.229
He thought it was you.

02:31:13.815 --> 02:31:16.525
How many cousins have you killed?

02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:21.989
How many sons and fathers
and brothers and husbands?

02:31:22.199 --> 02:31:24.784
How many, brave Achilles?

02:31:29.665 --> 02:31:31.791
I knew your father.

02:31:32.918 --> 02:31:35.211
He died before his time.

02:31:36.505 --> 02:31:41.676
But he was lucky not to live long enough
to see his son fall.

02:31:46.598 --> 02:31:49.267
You have taken everything from me.

02:31:51.353 --> 02:31:53.187
My eldest son...

02:31:53.814 --> 02:31:55.606
...heir to my throne...

02:31:56.024 --> 02:31:58.651
...defender of my kingdom.

02:32:00.028 --> 02:32:04.699
I cannot change what happened.
It is the will of the gods.

02:32:05.993 --> 02:32:09.328
But give me this small mercy.

02:32:11.665 --> 02:32:15.793
I loved my boy from the moment
he opened his eyes...

02:32:15.961 --> 02:32:18.796
...till the moment you closed them.

02:32:21.216 --> 02:32:24.218
Let me wash his body.

02:32:25.846 --> 02:32:29.056
Let me say the prayers.

02:32:30.350 --> 02:32:35.396
Let me place two coins on his eyes
for the boatman.

02:32:40.110 --> 02:32:42.361
If I let you walk out of here...

02:32:44.656 --> 02:32:46.574
...if I let you take him...

02:32:49.244 --> 02:32:51.287
...it doesn't change anything.

02:32:52.873 --> 02:32:55.541
You're still my enemy in the morning.

02:32:56.668 --> 02:32:59.712
You're still my enemy tonight.

02:33:00.756 --> 02:33:04.342
But even enemies can show respect.

02:33:24.029 --> 02:33:25.446
I admire your courage.

02:33:33.163 --> 02:33:34.955
Meet me outside in a moment.

02:34:21.002 --> 02:34:22.711
We'll meet again soon, my brother.

02:34:57.372 --> 02:34:59.790
Your son was the best I've fought.

02:35:03.044 --> 02:35:05.713
In my country, the funeral games
last for 12 days.

02:35:06.214 --> 02:35:08.340
It is the same in my country.

02:35:09.092 --> 02:35:11.260
Then the prince will have that honor.

02:35:12.137 --> 02:35:15.431
No Greek will attack Troy for 12 days.

02:35:21.563 --> 02:35:22.897
Briseis?

02:35:26.026 --> 02:35:28.402
I thought you were dead.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:40.372
You are free.

02:35:56.806 --> 02:35:58.516
If I hurt you...

02:36:00.894 --> 02:36:03.103
...it's not what I wanted.

02:36:17.619 --> 02:36:18.911
Go.

02:36:19.329 --> 02:36:22.498
No one will stop you. You have my word.

02:36:23.291 --> 02:36:24.959
Come, my girl.

02:36:32.133 --> 02:36:35.844
You're a far better king
than the one leading this army.

02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:54.860
Achilles makes a secret pact,
and I have to honor it?

02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:56.440
What treason is this?

02:36:56.741 --> 02:37:00.744
Consorting with the enemy king.
Giving him 12 days of peace.

02:37:00.912 --> 02:37:03.038
Peace! Peace!

02:37:03.331 --> 02:37:06.041
Their prince is dead.
Their army is leaderless.

02:37:06.209 --> 02:37:07.835
This is the time to attack!

02:37:08.169 --> 02:37:12.339
Even with Hector gone,
we have no way to breach their walls.

02:37:12.924 --> 02:37:15.342
They can wait 10 years for us to leave.

02:37:16.595 --> 02:37:19.305
I will smash their walls to the ground...

02:37:19.472 --> 02:37:22.057
...if it costs me 40,000 Greeks.

02:37:22.225 --> 02:37:24.852
Hear me, Zeus!

02:37:25.020 --> 02:37:28.731
I will smash their walls to the ground.

02:39:16.047 --> 02:39:17.464
That's good.

02:39:17.841 --> 02:39:19.758
For my son back home.

02:39:46.619 --> 02:39:48.162
« Well, Odysseus.

02:39:49.164 --> 02:39:53.834
You found a way to make
the sheep invite the wolves to dinner.

02:40:12.228 --> 02:40:15.939
Forgive me, Eudorus.
I should never have struck you.

02:40:18.234 --> 02:40:21.361
You've been a loyal friend all your life.

02:40:24.532 --> 02:40:27.201
I hope I never disappoint you again.

02:40:27.535 --> 02:40:30.037
It's I who have been the disappointment.

02:40:33.541 --> 02:40:36.210
Rouse the men. You're taking them home.

02:40:38.546 --> 02:40:40.380
Aren't you coming with us?

02:40:41.174 --> 02:40:43.383
I have my own battle to fight.

02:40:43.885 --> 02:40:45.552
Let me march beside you.

02:40:45.720 --> 02:40:49.556
No. I don't want our men
to be a part of this.

02:40:55.647 --> 02:40:57.481
It's a beautiful night.

02:40:58.149 --> 02:41:01.443
Go, Eudorus.
This is the last order I give you.

02:41:07.408 --> 02:41:10.577
Fighting for you has been
my life's honor, my lord.

02:41:24.260 --> 02:41:25.670
Open the gates!

02:41:26.380 --> 02:41:27.980
Open the gates!

02:41:41.109 --> 02:41:42.776
Here.

02:42:09.137 --> 02:42:10.804
« Plague.

02:42:11.472 --> 02:42:14.099
« Don't go too close, my king.

02:42:14.851 --> 02:42:17.102
This is the will of the gods.

02:42:17.270 --> 02:42:19.187
They desecrated the temple of Apollo...

02:42:19.731 --> 02:42:22.232
« ...and Apollo desecrated their flesh.

02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:26.320
They thought they could come here
and sack our city in a day.

02:42:26.487 --> 02:42:30.324
Now look at them,
fleeing across the Aegean.

02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:35.662
What is this?

02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:37.230
An offering to Poseidon.

02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:40.140
« The Greeks are praying
for a safe return home.

02:42:40.710 --> 02:42:43.587
« I hope the sea god spits
in their offering.

02:42:43.755 --> 02:42:46.423
« Lets them all drown
at the bottom of the sea.

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:47.890
This is a gift.

02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:50.600
We should take it
to the temple of Poseidon.

02:42:51.512 --> 02:42:53.513
- I think we should burn it.
« - Burn it? »

02:42:53.681 --> 02:42:55.515
My prince, it's a gift to the gods.

02:42:55.808 --> 02:42:58.018
The prince is right.

02:42:58.186 --> 02:43:01.730
I would burn the whole of Greece
if I had a big enough torch.

02:43:01.898 --> 02:43:05.609
« I warn you, good men,
be careful what you insult.

02:43:06.194 --> 02:43:10.364
Our beloved Prince Hector
had sharp words for the gods...

02:43:10.531 --> 02:43:13.659
...and a day later
Achilles' sword cut him down.

02:43:13.826 --> 02:43:16.370
Father, burn it.

02:43:17.160 --> 02:43:18.360
« Forgive me, my king,

02:43:18.570 --> 02:43:20.170
I mean no disrespect...

02:43:20.249 --> 02:43:23.001
...but I don't want to see
any more sons of Troy...

02:43:23.169 --> 02:43:25.712
...incur the gods' wrath.

02:43:27.715 --> 02:43:31.426
I will not watch another son die.

02:44:42.957 --> 02:44:44.499
« Look at them.

02:44:46.335 --> 02:44:48.795
You'd think their prince had never died.

02:44:50.965 --> 02:44:53.050
You are their prince now.

02:44:53.801 --> 02:44:55.844
Make your brother proud.

02:50:48.440 --> 02:50:49.840
Let it burn!

02:50:50.450 --> 02:50:52.550
Let Troy burn!

02:50:52.660 --> 02:50:55.305
Burn it! For Menelaus!

02:50:55.900 --> 02:50:57.100
Burn it!

02:50:57.450 --> 02:50:59.750
« Burn Troy!

02:50:59.760 --> 02:51:02.060
« Burn Troy!

02:51:02.461 --> 02:51:06.089
I promised you, brother!
I promised you!

02:51:06.257 --> 02:51:09.634
Burn it! Burn it for Menelaus!

02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:55.972
Briseis. Where is she?

02:51:56.140 --> 02:51:58.391
- Where?
- I don't know.

02:51:58.559 --> 02:52:00.393
Please. I have a son.

02:52:00.769 --> 02:52:03.229
Then get him out of Troy.

02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:11.154
Briseis!

02:52:15.500 --> 02:52:16.900

Helen. We must go.

02:52:21.832 --> 02:52:23.833
- Where?
- I'll show you. Now. Hurry.

02:52:24.001 --> 02:52:25.418
Paris. Paris.

02:52:25.586 --> 02:52:28.296
It's a long way. Quick. We must go now.

It's a long way. Quick.

« Hurry. There's a tunnel.

- Come.
- I stay.

02:52:49.568 --> 02:52:51.819
- No.
- My father will never abandon the city.

02:52:51.987 --> 02:52:53.071
I can't leave him.

02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:56.580
The city is dead.
They're burning it to the ground.

02:52:56.590 --> 02:52:57.390
No.

02:52:58.827 --> 02:53:00.787
- What's your name?
- Aeneas.

02:53:00.955 --> 02:53:03.957
- Do you know how to use a sword?
- Yes.

« The sword of Troy.

02:53:06.252 --> 02:53:09.796
As long as it's in the hands of a Trojan,
our people have a future.

« Protect them, Aeneas.

02:53:11.020 --> 02:53:12.220

- I will.
« - Hurry. Quick.

02:53:15.302 --> 02:53:17.720
Paris, Paris, Briseis wasn't in her room.

02:53:17.888 --> 02:53:19.389
I'll find her.

02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:22.800
Go.

02:53:24.311 --> 02:53:26.020
- I'll stay with you.
- Go.

Please don't leave me.

- How could you love me if I ran now?
- Please.

02:53:29.900 --> 02:53:33.195
We will be together again,
in this world or the next.

02:53:33.205 --> 02:53:34.705
We will be together.

I say we make him wait a little longer!

02:54:56.278 --> 02:54:59.447

Have you no honor?

Too late for prayer, priestess.

I almost lost this war
because of your little romance.
