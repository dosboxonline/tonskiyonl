WEBVTT

00:19.144 --> 00:20.562
I'm sorry about this.

00:20.646 --> 00:24.900
Don't you dare apologize. Thanks to you,
we can afford to get the other car fixed.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.235
Tell him, boys.

00:26.318 --> 00:27.277
-Bye, Dad.
-It's all right, Dad.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.237
Whatever.

00:29.655 --> 00:31.657
-Love you.
-Love you, darling.

00:32.448 --> 00:35.536
And tell your boss
I hope she gets heart disease.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.706
-Morning, Ted.
-Hey, Higgins--

00:41.834 --> 00:42.835
Is he dead?

00:44.962 --> 00:48.048
I mean, you know, it's my fault
for staring at my phone.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.133
I just can't stop
checking on my family's flight.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.969
You know, I haven't shared this
with too many folks,

00:52.052 --> 00:55.681
but Michelle and I,
we've been having some marital issues.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.725
Ted, you really don't have to
talk about this if you don't want to.

00:58.809 --> 00:59.726
I don't mind.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.937
Tried couples therapy.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.647
Didn't like the other couple though.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.026
It feels good to laugh.

01:08.110 --> 01:10.988
Yeah, you know, our therapist
gave us this code word to use.

01:11.071 --> 01:13.115
So if either of us says "Oklahoma,"

01:13.198 --> 01:15.409
the other one has to tell
the God's honest truth.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.369
Yeah, you know, it's pretty helpful.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.329
Did ruin the musical for me though.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.124
So now every time I hear,
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin',"

01:22.207 --> 01:26.295
or... what--
"Surrey with the Fringe on Top," or--

01:26.795 --> 01:28.964
-"Shall We Dance?"
-No, that's from King and I.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.717
Anyway, if I hear any of those tunes,

01:31.800 --> 01:33.635
I immediately think about
my wife telling me

01:33.719 --> 01:37.014
that my constant optimism is too much.

01:38.182 --> 01:41.185
And this... sharing of feelings

01:41.810 --> 01:44.646
is 'cause I opened up to you
about my ex-husband at the gala.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.064
Yes, ma'am.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.524
Well, that's a lesson learned.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.775
Come on now.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.653
I bet deep down you kinda dig
we're getting so close, right?

01:51.737 --> 01:52.863
I do.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.948
-Oklahoma?
-I do not.

02:18.263 --> 02:19.348
Jamie?

02:20.807 --> 02:21.808
You up?

02:28.357 --> 02:29.358
Hello?

02:30.108 --> 02:31.777
Is Jamie here?

02:31.860 --> 02:33.820
Oh, my God. You're Keeley Jones.

02:33.904 --> 02:35.572
Yeah, I am.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.450
Hi, Jamie.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.996
No, no. No. You can't get mad.
You broke up with me.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.623
Like, 24 hours ago.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.166
How long's a man meant to be alone?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.085
What am I supposed to do?
Shower by myself?

02:49.127 --> 02:51.004
Sorry, can I just say,
I'm your biggest fan.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.006
I follow your Insta,
your Snap, everything.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.008
Wow, thank you.

02:55.509 --> 02:56.844
And, Jamie, thank you.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.806
Whenever I break up with someone,
I spend months questioning it,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.350
wondering if I made
a huge fucking mistake.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.312
But you have really helped me to feel good
about this decision, just by...

03:10.107 --> 03:11.275
being you.

03:11.775 --> 03:12.776
You're welcome.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.444
What?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.363
You said I made you feel good
about your decision.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.532
-Yeah.
-Did you mean it?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.702
-Yes.
-Well, then you're welcome.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.121
I like to make people feel good.

03:26.248 --> 03:28.208
You still gonna be around
for the promo shoot later?

03:28.292 --> 03:30.794
The promo shoot
that I've spent weeks setting up for you?

03:31.545 --> 03:32.504
Yes.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.592
It was nice to meet you.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.223
Yes, yes, yes! Here!

03:44.641 --> 03:46.185
Yes, Jamie! Jamie, Jamie!

03:46.810 --> 03:49.146
Jamie, I'm open. Jamie!

03:51.190 --> 03:53.525
-What are you doing? That was going in.
-Well, we'll never know.

03:53.609 --> 03:55.903
Jamie, how many times I gotta tell you
to make the extra pass?

03:55.986 --> 03:59.698
Come on. Sam was more open than the jar
of peanut butter on my kitchen counter.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.825
What? What's he talking about?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.369
That's right. Y'all don't know
I like to keep the peanut butter open.

04:04.453 --> 04:06.872
That way, whenever I walk by,
I can just stick my finger in there.

04:07.998 --> 04:10.167
-It's a fucking good idea, to be fair.
-Yeah, it is.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.961
Now look, when Sam is that open,
you gotta pass to him, okay?

04:13.045 --> 04:16.255
But why?
Even when Sam's open, Sam is still shit.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.925
I heard my name. What did he say?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.760
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.470
Guys, we gotta play like a team tomorrow.

04:21.553 --> 04:24.973
Otherwise we're gonna
get our butts kicked. Extra passes.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.684
We're gonna keep doing this
until we get it right. Let's go.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.019
Dad!

04:34.233 --> 04:35.484
Practice is canceled.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.990
That is a lot longer run
than he thinks, though.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.075
Metaphor.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.120
-Hey!
-Daddy!

04:47.204 --> 04:49.665
I kinda thought y'all would meet me
halfway, but hey, that's all right.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.708
-Hey, buddy!
-Helicopter!

04:51.792 --> 04:55.879
You got it. Two spins. How about that?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.506
Boy, you're gonna be a dizzy fella there.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.967
-Slower helicopter.
-No way. Come on now.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.847
I missed you so much.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.306
Group hug.

05:06.390 --> 05:07.641
Hey! There he is.

05:07.724 --> 05:11.228
Hey, big guy. Look how tall you got.
What the heck?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.730
And look at this. I mean, you, what--
You got teeth now?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.149
-I already had teeth!
-And you can talk!

05:16.233 --> 05:18.068
Also, Ms. Welton, sorry to report,

05:18.151 --> 05:22.197
but this weekend's match
will not be completely sold out.

05:22.281 --> 05:25.742
Not a surprise. We've lost four matches
in a row, and we're facing relegation.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.828
But why be sorry?

05:27.911 --> 05:29.746
I think it's all going rather smashingly.

05:34.251 --> 05:38.672
I'm happy to be the new brand ambassador
for Darsteiner.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.300
The favorite beer of Jamie Tartt.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.261
Wait, wait, wait. Get my tats.

05:44.887 --> 05:48.098
Get that one. It's very important to me.
Chinese for "arm."

05:49.474 --> 05:50.893
-Jamie.
-What?

05:50.976 --> 05:52.394
-Just drink the beer.
-Yeah.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.939
No judgment,
but are you back with that twat?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.149
Bon appÃ©tit.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.903
No. We're done.
God, I love that you care though.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.739
I'll kiss you on the mouth
if I can reach those lips.

06:04.448 --> 06:06.992
You know, I put this whole thing together.
I get 10%.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.619
Hey, do you like mythology?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.954
You've seen a unicorn.
You ever seen a brewnicorn?

06:13.415 --> 06:15.542
-That's fucking funny.
-Oh, no.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.628
What's that? It's my beerby.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.046
-Come on.
-Okay.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.007
Y'all getting all this for free.
Not even extra for that.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.091
Keeley.

06:23.175 --> 06:26.178
If any of the other players
needed some branding work done,

06:26.261 --> 06:28.305
is that something you'd be interested in?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.515
I don't want you to offer me a job

06:29.598 --> 06:31.475
just 'cause I was nice to you
in the loo the other night.

06:31.558 --> 06:35.103
Why not? Men give each other jobs
in toilets all the time.

06:35.979 --> 06:36.980
Yeah, they do.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.567
I meant employment. Like job-jobs.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.320
-So not hand, or blow, or foot?
-Foot?

06:43.403 --> 06:47.491
You're right.
Technically it would be... feet, right?

06:48.659 --> 06:52.120
Just give it a thought.
Unless you want to carry on doing--

06:52.788 --> 06:53.997
What is it you do again?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.835
I'm sort of famous
for being almost famous.

06:58.544 --> 06:59.545
Excellent.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.173
-Maybe think of it as a plan B.
-Yeah.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.386
Okay, now,
little tip for y'all, all right?

07:07.469 --> 07:10.931
Fries are called "chips."
Chips are called "crisps."

07:11.014 --> 07:13.433
And "bangers" aren't great songs,

07:13.517 --> 07:16.645
but they do make you feel like dancing
'cause they're so darn tasty.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.189
When you gonna win a game,
you fucking wanker?

07:19.273 --> 07:22.401
Hey, Baz. Fellas.
This here-- This is my wife, Michelle.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.611
Absolute pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Lasso.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.738
Nice recovery. Well executed.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.532
-Yeah, coach's wife. She's heard it all.
-Yeah.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.701
Hi, Ted. Hello, young man.

07:31.493 --> 07:36.248
Here are the darts. There's the board.
Try not to hit any regulars.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.250
Yeah, go have fun.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.752
-Your table's this way.
-Go on. After you.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.297
-Three fish-and-chips?
-Yes, please. And two pints.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.007
-I like your style.
-Yeah.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.178
Look at this.

07:50.470 --> 07:55.726
Do they wrap the fish-and-chips
in newspaper? I read they do that here.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.438
No, no. I wish. Boy, I'd love that.
Having my food teach me stuff?

07:59.521 --> 08:01.440
Yeah, that's your dream scenario, right?

08:01.523 --> 08:03.567
A doughnut
that knows about Rosa Parks or something.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.360
-Yeah. Exactly, yeah.
-Yeah.

08:05.444 --> 08:07.654
Can fit a lot of wisdom just in the hole.

08:09.281 --> 08:10.324
Yeah.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.492
You already done, bud?

08:12.576 --> 08:14.286
Yeah, he probably should be.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.496
Well, I'm sorry about that.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.748
Happens all the time.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.085
-What are you doing?
-I'm just curious, yeah?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.087
The photographer's gonna
send me over the pictures,

08:24.171 --> 08:26.048
and I'll just kill the ones
where you look like shit.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.299
Then I'll send them over to you.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.594
Firstly, babe, there won't be any
where I look like shit because...

08:31.595 --> 08:34.640
And B, why don't you just
bring them over to my place

08:34.722 --> 08:36.433
and we can look at them together?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.059
Maybe we're naked.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.481
Hard no. Thank you again, Jamie.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.318
Smart move.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.487
Excuse me?

08:50.322 --> 08:52.199
I have to hang out with that prick.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.494
The fact that you would choose
to be with him is frankly mind-blowing.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.371
I'm not with him. We broke up.

08:57.454 --> 09:00.374
We're working together, actually.
And who asked you anyway, huh?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.458
Right.

09:02.668 --> 09:05.379
I didn't know that, so... apologies.

09:05.462 --> 09:08.131
No, it's fine.
You should definitely weigh in on my life.

09:08.215 --> 09:11.969
I'll make sure that I text you
anytime I have to make a decision, yeah?

09:14.429 --> 09:16.890
It's just that in training,
Sam was wide open,

09:16.974 --> 09:18.600
and Jamie wouldn't pass to him.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.227
But Sam was wide open.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.479
Now that's what I'm dealing with.

09:28.819 --> 09:29.820
Yes.

09:31.572 --> 09:32.614
Here it is.

09:33.198 --> 09:36.159
Yeah. Okay. Now, hold on a second.

09:37.536 --> 09:40.330
Think we might have missed a page.
Oh, boy.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.958
Don't you wanna go
ride a real double-decker bus?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.626
After we finish.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.670
See? I like that.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.881
First we gotta build it,
then we can ride it.

09:48.964 --> 09:51.633
It's kind of a Field of Dreams paradigm.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.093
Okay.

09:53.886 --> 09:57.139
Well, six hands are better than four.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.669
Good morning.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.046
Hey, how you doing?

10:32.382 --> 10:35.302
-Hey, look at that scarf. I like it.
-Oi! Wanker.

10:35.385 --> 10:37.221
Don't you fuck up the match.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.723
I appreciate you.
We'll see what happens, huh?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.187
Hey, check it out.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.231
You never--
Never seen one of these before.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.942
That right there, that's a scone, okay?

10:50.025 --> 10:52.277
It's like a muffin, except
it sucks all the spit out of your mouth.

10:52.361 --> 10:54.571
There's your breakfast. All right?
Hey! What do you say?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.948
Thanks, Dad!

10:56.031 --> 10:58.742
Okay. There you go.
Some people's kids, holy moly.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.169
-It's pretty nice out there, isn't it?
-Yeah.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.879
-Hey.
-I can make us some breakfast.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.130
What's wrong?

11:12.214 --> 11:14.383
Nothing. I think I'm just
a little jet-lagged is all.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.634
I'm fine, Ted.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.553
No, no. No.
Michelle, you gotta talk to me.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.138
Okay? Hey, hey. Oklahoma.

11:26.395 --> 11:27.646
Every day...

11:29.106 --> 11:33.110
I wake up hoping that
I'll feel the way I felt in the beginning.

11:33.986 --> 11:37.239
But maybe that's
just what marriage is, right?

11:38.699 --> 11:41.577
I'll keep trying. You know I will.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.163
Ready to go!

11:49.042 --> 11:51.044
-I mean, you're gonna need pants, kiddo.
-Yeah.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.046
-You know--
-Let's get some pants. Come on.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.225
I mean, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

12:05.851 --> 12:08.312
Marriage.
Just so, you know, so complicated.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.314
So many different challenges and...

12:10.898 --> 12:13.567
I think-- I don't know. Sorry.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.860
You ever been married?

12:16.570 --> 12:19.448
Yeah, Nate.
Coach's views on romantic relationships

12:19.531 --> 12:21.909
are not too dissimilar
from his views on cooking steak.

12:21.992 --> 12:25.370
You know, you spend any more than
five minutes on one, loses its flavor.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.706
-That sound about right, Coach?
-Yeah.

12:27.789 --> 12:29.791
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question then?

12:29.875 --> 12:30.792
Fire away.

12:30.876 --> 12:32.211
If you were worried
about your relationship,

12:32.294 --> 12:36.089
then why did you fly 4,438 miles away?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.759
That is a very specific number
to know off the top of your head.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.719
Well, my dad used to be a cartographer.

12:41.178 --> 12:44.473
Used to say I was .001 miles tall.

12:46.391 --> 12:49.520
Yeah. Well, it's a good question.
Why do it?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.689
I think at some point I realized

12:52.773 --> 12:57.486
that me being around so much
was doing more harm than good.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.199
Like, anytime I tried
to solve any of her problems, or...

13:03.909 --> 13:07.162
do something sweet for her,
it just would backfire.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.250
And then she and this therapist
we were working with

13:11.333 --> 13:15.796
decided that maybe the best thing to do
would be to give her a little space.

13:15.879 --> 13:20.759
And so... well, I gave her 4,400 and...

13:20.843 --> 13:21.677
Thirty-eight.

13:22.594 --> 13:24.179
Thirty-eight miles worth of it.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.685
Sorry to interrupt.
I was told one of you had my phone.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.312
Thank heavens.

13:32.396 --> 13:34.731
I deleted some apps
to optimize performance.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.358
Not Battleships, I hope.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.569
Oh, well.
I was playing that too much anyway.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.321
I'll leave you lads
to your match day planning.

13:41.405 --> 13:43.282
Now, well, hold your horse there, amigo.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.158
You mind if I get your take on something?

13:45.242 --> 13:47.286
Wow, of course.

13:47.369 --> 13:52.040
Very exciting to be invited
into the inner sanctum.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.210
Team Lasso, as it were.

13:55.294 --> 13:57.588
You and the missus.
Y'all been together a while, yeah?

13:58.005 --> 14:01.175
Yes, 28 years.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.468
Five boys, three dogs,

14:03.552 --> 14:07.389
one 20-year-old cat whose impending death
will wreck me emotionally,

14:07.472 --> 14:10.601
and one small house
that manages to fit us all in it.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.686
Sounds like a full life right there.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.523
But I assume y'all have had your
fair share of hard times though, yeah?

14:16.607 --> 14:20.861
Did you not hear the five boys,
tiny house, dying cat part?

14:23.739 --> 14:24.907
That's the thing though, isn't it?

14:24.990 --> 14:28.952
If you're with the right person,
even the hard times are easy.

14:31.955 --> 14:36.084
Someone call 911.
I want to report a truth bomb.

14:37.127 --> 14:40.005
-I think they do 999 here.
-It is 999.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.340
-Yes. It is, yeah.
-For emergencies?

14:41.423 --> 14:43.008
Boy, that seems troublesome to me.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.427
You know,
toddlers and, just, butt dials and--

14:45.511 --> 14:46.637
-'Cause it's one key.
-Yeah.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.639
You'd probably have
police cars and ambulances

14:48.722 --> 14:50.599
-just zipping all over the place.
-Yeah.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.559
-Well, that happens a lot, doesn't it?
-It does. Yeah, yeah.

14:52.643 --> 14:54.686
-That explains it, actually.
-There you have it.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.980
Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

14:57.064 --> 15:00.567
Live from Nelson Road Stadium,
the home of AFC Richmond.

15:00.651 --> 15:02.277
All right, everyone!
Get in a fucking circle.

15:02.361 --> 15:04.029
-Let's throw this down!
-Come on, boys!

15:04.112 --> 15:05.572
Right, hands in.

15:05.656 --> 15:07.908
On three. One, two, three...

15:07.991 --> 15:09.993
-Richmond!
-Let's go!

15:13.455 --> 15:15.249
Let's go! Let's go!

15:21.630 --> 15:23.382
Jamie, you a germophobe?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.467
'Cause I'm trying to think of a reason
you didn't put your hand in

15:25.551 --> 15:26.468
with the rest of the team.

15:26.552 --> 15:27.594
Didn't want to.

15:29.638 --> 15:32.641
I gotta say, man, sometimes you remind me
of my grandma with the channel hopper.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.226
You just push all the wrong buttons.

15:34.726 --> 15:39.147
Well, then how's about
you and me make a deal?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.607
Okay, I'm listening.

15:40.691 --> 15:44.570
You get to keep on preaching
all of your yeehaw bullshit,

15:44.653 --> 15:49.825
and in exchange, I'll keep ignoring you,
because this team is tragic.

15:51.243 --> 15:54.246
I score all the goals,
and I'm the only one they come to see.

15:54.997 --> 15:56.832
Does that sound fair? Hands in.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.585
You know, I'd love to hash out
some of the nuances there,

15:59.668 --> 16:01.044
but I'm not having the best of days--

16:01.128 --> 16:02.546
Actually, it doesn't matter what you say.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.340
'Cause in my head, I'm just
hearing the crowd cheer my name

16:05.424 --> 16:06.842
after I score a goal tonight.

16:07.301 --> 16:12.264
Jamie Tartt...
Jamie Tartt...

16:12.347 --> 16:15.309
As undeniably catchy as that tune is,
I need you to cut the crap right now--

16:15.392 --> 16:16.768
Dad!

16:16.852 --> 16:20.022
Hey, big guy. There he is. Hey.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.733
-Jamie Tartt?
-Hello, little lad.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.359
Would you sign my shirt?

16:25.235 --> 16:26.486
All right, turn around.

16:27.905 --> 16:28.989
That's pretty cool, huh?

16:29.698 --> 16:33.368
Now, next time I score a goal,
it won't just be for me.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.331
It'll be for you too.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.252
And for me. But... just for us.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.588
-Cool.
-Good lad.

16:46.590 --> 16:47.716
Good boy.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.720
Come on, let's get out there.

16:51.803 --> 16:57.267
Jamie Tartt...
Jamie Tartt...

16:57.351 --> 16:58.810
-Come on, goalie!
-Link finds space.

16:58.894 --> 17:00.229
He rears back to shoot it.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.731
A stunning goal
by the Canadian midfielder!

17:02.814 --> 17:06.777
-Fuck's sake!
-I hate that poxy wanker! Fucking Lasso!

17:06.859 --> 17:10.030
-Nice family though.
-Damn it, Paul! Don't humanize him!

17:10.113 --> 17:13.575
Well, after only six minutes,
Richmond are 2-0 down.

17:13.659 --> 17:14.492
Wanker! Wanker!

17:14.576 --> 17:16.994
And the Richmond supporters
are making their feelings known.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.079
Wanker! Wanker!

17:18.163 --> 17:20.082
Chris, you have to think,
if this continues,

17:20.165 --> 17:23.669
Lasso's time with Richmond will be short
and not very sweet.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.088
Tartt receives the ball. Clever there.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.798
-Go on, Jamie.
-He finds space.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.174
He has Obisanya on the right.

17:29.258 --> 17:32.970
No, he's doing it himself.
And what a finish!

17:33.053 --> 17:35.681
Jamie Tartt with an incredible solo goal!

17:35.764 --> 17:37.891
Jamie Tartt, you fucking king!

17:37.975 --> 17:42.229
Jamie Tartt...
Jamie Tartt...

17:42.312 --> 17:45.232
And thanks to budding superstar,
Jamie Tartt,

17:45.315 --> 17:48.819
Richmond are right back in it at 2-1
in the 29th minute!

17:48.902 --> 17:51.113
-Me!
-What's he yelling?

17:51.196 --> 17:55.242
"Me." He's pointing at the name
on his back and repeatedly yelling "me."

17:55.325 --> 17:56.827
Me!

17:56.910 --> 17:59.079
I thought he was saying "meat."

17:59.162 --> 18:01.206
But, yeah,
yours makes a lot more sense. Okay.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.168
-Come on!
-Obisanya joins the attack.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.920
-The Nigerian is taken out!
-Bullshit!

18:07.546 --> 18:10.465
Come on, ref! They gotta knock that off!

18:11.008 --> 18:13.343
It'll be a yellow card here for Benson.

18:13.427 --> 18:17.181
And you have to say he got off easy there.
And Obisanya is still down.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.765
-He might be hurt.
-Yeah.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.726
Excuse me, mate.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.438
Oi! Check on your fucking teammate.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.358
The captain dispensing some wisdom
to the young superstar.

18:28.442 --> 18:29.776
Nothing wrong with that.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.905
-Sam?
-Yeah?

18:32.988 --> 18:35.240
I'm gonna have to move you there.
There you go.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.826
-What is your fucking problem?
-What is this?

18:37.910 --> 18:39.745
Kent and Tartt
are at each other's throats!

18:39.828 --> 18:42.915
-Okay. Hey, guys! Come on! Knock it off!
-Hopefully cooler heads will prevail.

18:42.998 --> 18:44.041
Fucking kill you!

18:44.124 --> 18:45.083
Same team!

18:45.167 --> 18:48.170
-Unacceptable, Arlo.
-Chris, have you ever struck a teammate?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.255
-Are you mad? So what?
-No, but I've wanted to.

18:50.339 --> 18:51.465
-He's my own player.
-Yeah, yeah.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.509
-I'm actually a bit jealous.
-You gotta be--

18:53.592 --> 18:56.929
We haven't seen this
since 2001 in Newcastle.

18:57.012 --> 19:01.099
And a season of lows for Richmond
sinks even further still.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.602
You all right, Sam?

19:03.685 --> 19:05.646
Honestly, it doesn't even hurt anymore.

19:05.729 --> 19:08.440
But everyone was making such a fuss,
I thought I should just stay down.

19:09.566 --> 19:11.026
No. Listen.

19:11.109 --> 19:14.112
I'm gonna pull you up,
you're gonna pretend to limp very badly,

19:14.196 --> 19:17.157
and you're gonna gesture
like you think you can bravely go on.

19:17.741 --> 19:19.785
-They'll love it.
-Okay.

19:21.620 --> 19:24.706
Obisanya is on his feet,
but can he continue?

19:24.790 --> 19:26.041
Is he okay?

19:26.583 --> 19:28.377
Looks like he'll play through the pain.

19:28.460 --> 19:31.463
Such determination. You love to see it.

19:31.547 --> 19:32.756
Attaboy, Sam!

19:33.131 --> 19:37.344
Tartt steps up to take the free kick,
with an opportunity to tie the game.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.389
Will he find a teammate or go for glory?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.475
With Tartt, that's usually
a rhetorical question.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.484
And he's done it!

19:52.568 --> 19:55.737
That's two for Jamie Tartt,
and Richmond are level

19:55.821 --> 19:57.531
in the 38th minute!

19:57.614 --> 19:59.324
He's a special player, Arlo.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.409
Look at this.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.746
And you have to wonder,
where would Richmond be without him.

20:08.834 --> 20:09.835
I'll be right back.

20:10.794 --> 20:12.212
Me! Me!

20:13.547 --> 20:17.801
We certainly haven't seen this before.
Ted Lasso is running into the stands.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.803
Well, where the hell is he off to?

20:21.013 --> 20:22.764
He's not slowing down on those steps.

20:22.848 --> 20:25.601
That's some real impressive cardio
from Ted Lasso there.

20:25.684 --> 20:26.685
Is he okay?

20:28.562 --> 20:30.480
-Hey, Rebecca.
-Hello, Ted.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.524
-You're doing great, Dad.
-Yeah, you got this.

20:32.608 --> 20:33.609
Thanks, guys.

20:33.692 --> 20:35.152
I wanna bench Jamie.

20:35.944 --> 20:38.071
But I didn't wanna do it
without checking with you first.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.866
But, Ted, you're the manager.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.952
So whatever you decide,
you have my full support.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.163
Thanks, boss. All right.
Later, alligators.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.289
Bye, Dad.

20:50.292 --> 20:54.379
And it appears Coach Lasso has decided
to rejoin the match already in progress.

20:54.463 --> 20:57.049
Roberts, warm up. You're going in.
Let's go. Come on.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.301
Hey, highlighter. We got ourselves a sub.

20:59.384 --> 21:00.886
-Sixteen's going in for nine. Okay?
-Okay.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.471
Appreciate you, sir. Thank you.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.812
Okay.

21:10.896 --> 21:13.732
Well, it looks like Lasso is
making an early substitution here.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.984
He's bringing Roberts on,
and he's taking off...

21:16.944 --> 21:18.362
Jamie Tartt?

21:20.030 --> 21:21.365
He's our best player!

21:22.407 --> 21:23.408
Me?

21:23.492 --> 21:24.952
You don't know what you're doing!

21:25.035 --> 21:28.247
You don't know what you're doing!
You don't know what you're doing!

21:28.330 --> 21:29.873
What on earth?

21:29.957 --> 21:32.292
He's taking off his best player.

21:32.376 --> 21:34.837
And with less than a minute remaining
in the half.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.880
-Wanker! Wanker! Wanker!
-Number 16, Robbie Roberts,

21:36.964 --> 21:38.507
for number 9, Jamie Tartt.

21:38.590 --> 21:40.467
Hey, way to play out there.
Way to get us back in.

21:40.551 --> 21:43.971
Shut up. Fucking stupid twat.

21:45.556 --> 21:48.684
The referee looks at his watch,
and that's halftime.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.603
What kind of reception awaits Lasso
in his locker room?

22:03.866 --> 22:05.617
Oi, sit down and listen.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.959
We got ourselves a tied game.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.336
Nice work.

22:18.755 --> 22:23.093
Fellas, we're broken. We need to change.

22:23.177 --> 22:25.762
And, look, I know change can be scary.

22:25.846 --> 22:29.766
One minute, you're playing freeze tag
out there at recess with all your buddies.

22:29.850 --> 22:33.228
Next thing you know,
you're getting zits, your voice gets low.

22:33.312 --> 22:36.607
And every time your art teacher,
Ms. Scanlon, leans over your desk

22:36.690 --> 22:40.194
to check and see how your project's going,
you feel all squiggly inside.

22:44.281 --> 22:48.535
She was a striking woman.
Not classically beautiful, but striking.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.080
First time I ever saw tan lines.

22:52.998 --> 22:54.583
Most of the time, change is a good thing.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.294
Now, I think that's what it's all about.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.339
Embracing change.

23:00.756 --> 23:02.257
Being brave.

23:02.341 --> 23:06.845
Doing whatever you have to,
so that everyone in your life...

23:08.555 --> 23:09.973
can move forward with theirs.

23:11.767 --> 23:13.018
'Cause maybe...

23:14.186 --> 23:16.813
it's the only way
you can truly help her be happy.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.406
Obviously by "her,"
I'm referring to Lady Football.

23:28.492 --> 23:29.868
Good save.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.830
Sam, we're gonna shift you to midfield
for the second half.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.167
And Beard's gonna walk y'all
through the rest of the changes.

23:37.251 --> 23:38.961
Hey, hey, hey. One last thing.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.421
And I want everyone's eyes on me
when I say this. Look at me.

23:51.765 --> 23:53.976
-Never really liked Tartt.
-We know, Roy.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.477
Everybody, come on.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.814
Two minutes of added time remaining.

23:58.897 --> 24:01.024
Still level at two goals apiece.

24:01.108 --> 24:03.610
Richmond have played well,
even without Jamie Tartt.

24:03.694 --> 24:04.695
Here we go.

24:05.237 --> 24:07.781
He's open. He's open. He's open.
There you go.

24:07.865 --> 24:10.742
A through ball from Cockburn.
And Kent is off to the races!

24:10.826 --> 24:11.702
Come on!

24:11.785 --> 24:13.370
Kent has only one man to beat.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.914
He could take it himself,

24:15.998 --> 24:20.544
but he makes the extra pass
to a wide open Obisanya!

24:23.839 --> 24:26.341
And he buries it!

24:27.634 --> 24:28.886
Oh, my God!

24:30.220 --> 24:34.933
Richmond take the lead with
barely a minute of stoppage time left.

24:41.773 --> 24:45.944
Scorer for Richmond's third goal,
number 24, Sam Obisanya.

24:55.037 --> 24:56.955
Yeah!

24:57.039 --> 24:59.917
-I'm so sorry! I'm just so happy!
-No, I love it! I love this energy!

25:00.000 --> 25:02.711
-Here, Coach. Take this guy from me.
-Yeah!

25:06.006 --> 25:07.007
That's the way you do it!

25:07.090 --> 25:11.261
Nicely done, gentlemen! Nicely done!
Way to do it! Yes! Yes! Yes!

25:11.970 --> 25:13.263
Took balls, what you did.

25:14.806 --> 25:17.476
That's all we got is balls, Roy.
It's all we got.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.562
All right! Yeah!
There you go. Way to play.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.731
How about that, Coach?

25:23.690 --> 25:24.775
You hear that, Coach?

25:25.442 --> 25:27.444
Wanker! Wanker!

25:27.528 --> 25:29.238
Well, same word, ain't it?

25:30.239 --> 25:31.740
Yeah, but different.

25:33.075 --> 25:37.287
Yeah, kinda like back in the '80s
when bad meant good, right?

25:38.038 --> 25:39.414
Who was president back then?

25:40.082 --> 25:43.293
-Ronald Reagan.
-"Ronald Reagan? The actor?"

25:43.377 --> 25:48.173
Oh, man. I love it when you do Doc Brown.
You walked me right into that.

25:55.472 --> 25:58.809
Daddy! Dad!

25:58.892 --> 26:00.644
Hey! There he is!

26:02.521 --> 26:04.314
How about that, huh? We won one.

26:04.398 --> 26:05.399
-Daddy?
-Yeah?

26:05.482 --> 26:06.817
What's a wanker?

26:07.776 --> 26:09.653
Well, kiddo. That is a...

26:10.404 --> 26:13.824
That's a man that likes to be alone
with his thoughts. Make sense?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.492
Let's give you a better view
of all this. Ready?

26:16.368 --> 26:18.120
Get up there, kiddo. Look at that.

26:18.203 --> 26:21.874
Wave to the people. That's it.
Let them know. Let them see, huh?

26:24.501 --> 26:26.253
Shit.

26:29.381 --> 26:30.382
Yeah.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.801
One touch.

26:36.638 --> 26:40.184
I just keep thinking about
the first time we met, back at school.

26:42.644 --> 26:46.440
Us being the only two people in that big
old parking lot at the exact same time.

26:48.942 --> 26:50.652
So random.

26:50.736 --> 26:53.614
No way for us to know that it was going
to be the start of something.

26:55.616 --> 26:57.034
-Hey.
-Did I scare you?

26:57.117 --> 27:00.245
You snuck up on a woman
in a parking lot at night.

27:01.622 --> 27:03.665
Yeah, Roy, well done.

27:03.749 --> 27:06.793
I'm sorry. I'm an idiot.
I was also an idiot yesterday, so...

27:07.920 --> 27:08.921
It's okay.

27:14.426 --> 27:15.427
Good night, Keeley.

27:17.638 --> 27:18.639
Good night, Roy.

27:20.057 --> 27:22.518
I look back at everything
we've been through,

27:23.310 --> 27:25.229
and I wouldn't change a single thing.

27:27.272 --> 27:28.273
Even now.

27:30.317 --> 27:31.527
What are you saying?

27:32.611 --> 27:35.781
Michelle, if there is something
I could... do

27:35.864 --> 27:39.493
or something I could say
that would make you be happy...

27:40.577 --> 27:42.079
just being with me, I'd do it.

27:42.663 --> 27:44.373
I'd do it in a nanosecond.

27:44.456 --> 27:46.625
But I ain't got no control
over any of that.

27:48.919 --> 27:50.671
You don't have to keep trying anymore.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.173
It's okay.

27:54.800 --> 27:57.803
I'm gonna be okay. Yeah?

28:05.561 --> 28:07.354
Okay, quick feet. There we go.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.438
Shoot.

28:10.274 --> 28:13.360
I promised myself
I would never quit anything in my life.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.487
But you're not quitting, Ted.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.366
You're just letting me go.

28:23.912 --> 28:24.913
Yeah.

28:25.497 --> 28:26.498
Come on.

28:31.044 --> 28:32.045
You ready?

28:32.129 --> 28:33.505
-Yeah.
-Yes. Thank you.

28:33.589 --> 28:35.799
-It's all right.
-I appreciate you, Shannon. Thank you.

28:35.883 --> 28:39.553
Hey, buddy. I'm gonna see you
the second after the season's over, okay?

28:39.636 --> 28:41.346
And we're gonna talk every day?

28:41.430 --> 28:43.932
Absolutely. Just like we do, big guy.
You know it. Okay?

28:44.016 --> 28:46.310
Well, gimme a hug, please. Yeah.

28:49.563 --> 28:51.607
Okay now, okay.

28:52.274 --> 28:55.402
Hey, I love you. Go ahead, get on.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.886
Oi, wanker. Good job tonight.

30:04.388 --> 30:05.722
Thank you, sir.

30:05.806 --> 30:08.433
Keep an eye on us.
We might be turning this thing around.
