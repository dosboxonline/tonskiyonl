WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.886
Tartt, edge of the area.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.431
He has options. Chooses Rojas.

00:16.058 --> 00:18.477
What a goal! Great finish.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.313
You have to say, Chris,
from where they started the season,

00:21.396 --> 00:24.066
this Richmond team is unrecognizable!

00:24.149 --> 00:27.569
What a turnaround for AFC Richmond!

00:27.653 --> 00:31.823
And with that Dani Rojas goal, Richmond
are now on a four-game winning streak.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.700
They've certainly turned things around

00:33.784 --> 00:36.620
since adding their former captain
to the coaching staff, Wrighty?

00:36.703 --> 00:37.788
Absolutely, Seems.

00:37.871 --> 00:41.291
And watching Richmond play, you could
definitely see the Roy Kent effect.

00:41.375 --> 00:45.170
And that leads them nicely
into Saturday's FA Cup quarterfinal clash

00:45.254 --> 00:47.589
against Premiership side
Tottenham Hotspur.

00:47.673 --> 00:48.841
Yeah, good luck with that.

00:48.924 --> 00:51.552
It kills me to say it,
but Tottenham are a top top side.

00:51.635 --> 00:53.136
Unbelievable team.

00:53.220 --> 00:56.014
Coming up next,
we'll preview the quarterfinal

00:56.098 --> 00:58.308
between Bournemouth and Southampton.

00:58.392 --> 01:00.435
-Do you want a cup of tea?
-Yes, please.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.945
-Sugar?
-No, thank you.

01:11.530 --> 01:16.201
Luca, do you believe in guardian angels?

01:16.285 --> 01:18.370
Are they like Guardians of the Galaxy?

01:21.707 --> 01:23.750
Wait, are you naked in my kitchen?

01:24.459 --> 01:25.669
Wearing a smile.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.671
Put some clothes on!

01:28.297 --> 01:30.549
Mina the cleaner will be here any second.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.182
Mina. Do you want some tea?

01:38.765 --> 01:40.392
Will there be biscuits with that?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.476
Mother.

01:42.853 --> 01:43.854
Hello, darling.

01:44.688 --> 01:45.814
I've left your father.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.193
Wait, your mum's your cleaner?

01:49.276 --> 01:50.277
No.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.614
He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't respect me.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.992
And Esther Perel says
it takes two people to create a pattern

01:57.075 --> 01:58.577
but only one to change it.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.205
I am that change.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.706
Good for you.

02:03.415 --> 02:05.918
Luca, will you please put some clothes on?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.550
I'll start in the study.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.594
Yes, thank you.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.915
Hey, Liza.
Saw your Instagram post on Sunday.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.708
Way to keep
that ice bucket challenge alive.

02:46.792 --> 02:48.794
-Morning.
-Hey, Derek.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.423
Great morning, Isabelle.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.591
-Yes.
-Hey, Ted.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.677
Hey, Liam.
Hey, tell your mom happy birthday for me.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.847
And whatever gift you end up getting her,
let her know it's from both of us, huh?

03:03.767 --> 03:05.227
-Morning. How y'all doing?
-Morning.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.397
You're doing great work, Colin.
And I love your new mantra.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.233
I'm a strong and capable man.
I am not a piece of shit.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.402
-You don't need the second part.
-Right.

03:13.485 --> 03:14.695
-Morning, Colin.
-Hey.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.446
Hey, Doc.
You get in any trouble last night?

03:17.030 --> 03:18.699
Nothing I care to speak about at work.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.410
Doc, you are more mysterious
than David Blaine

03:21.493 --> 03:23.912
reading a Sue Grafton novel at Area 51.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.331
Well, Ted, make an appointment
when you need to talk.

03:26.415 --> 03:27.624
Hey, I talk all the time, Doc.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.293
Just let me follow you around
for ten minutes.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.794
After five,
you'll want me to hush my butt.

03:31.795 --> 03:33.630
-Lookee here.
-Morning, Ted.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.216
Hey. I tell you what,
I'm shipping the heck out of you two.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.594
I'm calling HR.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.429
Yeah, well,
tell Mr. Pufnstuf I said hello.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.600
That is a joke
for people born in the early to mid '70s.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.395
And then they just
changed the shape of the tortellini…

03:49.146 --> 03:52.858
Well, I don't know about you fellas,
but I am fired up for this FA Cup thing.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.026
I mean, come on.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.570
A March Madness tournament
in the middle of our season

03:56.653 --> 03:58.864
featuring every dang team in the country?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.407
Yes, please.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.868
I mean, what we got?
Davids versus Goliaths, right?

04:02.951 --> 04:05.996
You know? Rockys versus Apollos.
Steve Wiebes against Billy Mitchells.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.332
-What's another one, Coach?
-Pearl Jam versus Ticketmaster.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.084
Classic battle of art
versus commerce right there. Yeah.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.419
I got a question for you though.

04:12.503 --> 04:15.547
Has a team not in the Premier League,
à la us, ever won the whole chimichanga?

04:15.631 --> 04:17.673
-Eight times.
-Eight times. Really?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.134
But not for 40 years.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.637
What have we got here?

04:21.720 --> 04:23.805
Uh-oh.
You back into floating office mode, huh?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.557
Yeah. But it's no bother.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.643
I'm a flaneur by nature.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.269
I get that, yeah.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.771
Hey, Coach, what's a flaneur?

04:30.854 --> 04:32.105
A wanderer.

04:32.898 --> 04:35.567
-What the fuck's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

04:37.069 --> 04:38.487
Jane and I got back together.

04:39.238 --> 04:40.614
-Great news.
-Well, that's nice.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.158
-Fantastic.
-How about that. Look at you guys.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.536
Do you really think that's a good idea?

04:53.460 --> 04:55.337
Shit. Two missed calls from her.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.547
Be right back!

04:58.757 --> 05:01.760
I'd like to request an emergency meeting
of the Diamond Dogs.

05:01.844 --> 05:03.095
Diamond Dogs, mount up.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.598
-Hey, Roy, you wanna sit in with us?
-No.

05:06.682 --> 05:08.308
Okay. Yeah, shut that.

05:10.686 --> 05:11.687
He looks a little bit--

05:11.770 --> 05:14.356
Yeah, you're gonna come in through here.
That's fine. I got you.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.607
Just-- Do you wanna--

05:15.691 --> 05:16.650
Dukes of Hazzard style,

05:16.733 --> 05:18.735
or as you guys probably call it,
"the Earls of Risk."

05:18.819 --> 05:21.071
-Just go round.
-Yeah. Why don't you come legs first?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.406
You wanna-- You wanna jump in?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.366
You'd be in here if you just went round.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.618
-Ready? Here he comes. Right--
-I'm just gonna stay here.

05:26.702 --> 05:28.370
That's fine. Good idea. Probably best.

05:28.453 --> 05:32.082
All right. Okay, Higgiebottoms,
you called this puppy, so start barking.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.836
Well, I'm just not sure that
Jane and Beard are very healthy together.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.754
And I'm a little bit disappointed

05:37.838 --> 05:40.132
that neither of you backed me up
when I just said so.

05:41.717 --> 05:42.885
Okay. Calling us out.

05:42.968 --> 05:45.053
I appreciate that and I hear you, but--

05:45.137 --> 05:48.015
I mean, in my defense,
I know why I didn't say anything.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.726
-And why's that?
-'Cause you should never say anything.

05:50.809 --> 05:52.603
And look, man,
I learned that the hard way.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.647
One of my best friends growing up
was this fella, Marcus Girard.

05:55.731 --> 05:59.443
He dated the same girl from grade school
to high school to college, whole time.

05:59.526 --> 06:02.529
And she could be a little bit of a pill,
if I'm being honest, you know?

06:02.613 --> 06:03.864
No reason to start lying now.

06:03.947 --> 06:06.825
And, well, I let him know that.
I told him so.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.328
And he was not too pleased, all right?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.830
And that is the last time
I ever gave a best man speech.

06:11.914 --> 06:15.417
I mean, yeah, I try to be
outwardly supportive of all relationships

06:15.501 --> 06:17.711
due to my dad
sabotaging one of my first loves.

06:18.462 --> 06:21.632
In year four, he sat me
and my classmate, Nadia Shookums, down

06:21.715 --> 06:24.134
in the living room and said
he thought we could both do better.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.137
Well, she listened to him.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.598
Boy, that's a heaping spoonful
of truth soup right there.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.849
Yeah. I know.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.851
Look, Higgins,
I just think it's bad business

06:32.935 --> 06:35.604
to get all up
in anyone else's business, you know?

06:36.230 --> 06:38.065
Okay, I understand.

06:39.775 --> 06:42.736
So even though this is an unsanctioned
meeting because Beard wasn't here,

06:42.819 --> 06:44.655
let's just go ahead
and Diamond Dogs dismount.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.161
Stupid barking means it's over, right?

06:51.245 --> 06:52.246
Yes, sir. Welcome back.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.998
-Ay, ay, ay. That was a doozy.
-What's wrong?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.709
Jane's roommate flipped out on her.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.253
-Kicked her out of the house.
-Oh, no.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.547
So now she's moving in with me.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.257
That's good.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.092
That's great news. Congratulations.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.011
Thanks, guys.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.607
All right. Chin up, lads.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.484
Come on, Colin. You dolt.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.863
Colin, you're leaning too far back.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.614
Head down, fucking whip it.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.951
I am a strong and capable man.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.286
Thanks, Roy.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.329
Bumbercatch, great pass,

07:34.413 --> 07:36.248
but it don't mean shit
if they see it coming.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.333
The rest of you in the box,
when the shot goes,

07:38.417 --> 07:39.835
you fucking follow it in.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.004
Yeah, you smell that, lads?

07:42.087 --> 07:43.380
That's the Roy Kent effect.

07:45.424 --> 07:48.385
-Roy Kent! Roy Kent!
-Roy Kent!

07:53.640 --> 07:54.850
Anything for me, coach?

07:57.811 --> 07:58.979
All right, let's go again.

08:02.941 --> 08:05.611
Hey, Roy. You know you're paid
to coach the whole team, right?

08:06.111 --> 08:09.031
No, no, that's fine.
Just take 4% off my paycheck.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.657
Ted!

08:11.408 --> 08:12.951
-Ted!
-You hear that?

08:14.953 --> 08:16.038
Hey!

08:16.121 --> 08:18.373
Do you have lunch plans?

08:18.457 --> 08:20.501
As a matter of fact, I do, yeah.

08:20.584 --> 08:23.670
Coach Beard and I here
are doing Secret Sandwich Switcheroo

08:23.754 --> 08:24.922
every other Friday.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.217
-What we do is I make a sandwich--
-I don't care, Ted.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.844
You're coming to lunch
with me and my mother.

08:30.928 --> 08:32.095
Okay. Sounds great.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.097
Spoiler alert. I made you a BLT.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.767
-Samesies.
-What?

08:37.267 --> 08:39.977
Crown & Anchor at 2:00.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.063
Okay.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.983
I look forward to lunching with you, Ted.

08:45.067 --> 08:46.777
Hi, Rebecca's mom.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.362
Hey, fellas. Say hi.

08:48.445 --> 08:50.405
Hi, Rebecca's mum.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.907
Hello, boys.

08:51.990 --> 08:55.077
And the name's not Rebecca's mum,
it's Deborah.

08:55.160 --> 08:56.995
I'm a work in progress,

08:57.079 --> 08:59.790
a voracious book on tape listener

08:59.873 --> 09:03.961
and a staunch believer
that if you get dealt lemons in life,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.880
then you should make
lemon lavender mojitos.

09:06.964 --> 09:07.965
Mum!

09:08.757 --> 09:10.509
Nice to meet you, Deborah.

09:12.219 --> 09:14.805
Boy, I love meeting people's moms.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.474
It's like reading an instruction manual
as to why they're nuts.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.476
Let's go!

09:20.102 --> 09:21.562
How's Mrs. Beard doing, by the way?

09:21.645 --> 09:23.605
-Full-blown QAnon.
-Yep.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.279
-Hey, look alive, Coach.
-Thank you.

09:30.946 --> 09:32.823
-No horseradish?
-I thought you were allergic?

09:32.906 --> 09:34.157
To horses and radishes.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.242
I'm sorry.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.077
-Hi, guys.
-Hey.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.205
Ted. Do you reckon you'd be up for
driving us back from lunch?

09:40.289 --> 09:41.415
Sure, I'll give it a shot.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.166
I've got some creative work
I wanna do this afternoon

09:43.250 --> 09:44.626
and I kinda wanna be
a little buzzed for it.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.379
-Seems like a great idea all around.
-Thank you.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.257
One second here.

09:50.340 --> 09:51.341
Hello?

09:52.176 --> 09:53.177
This is him.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.638
W-- Is he okay?

09:58.765 --> 10:00.434
Okay. Okay. I'll--

10:00.517 --> 10:03.061
Well, I mean, that's gonna be
a little tricky 'cause I'm at work.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.522
No, I work in London.

10:06.023 --> 10:07.900
Yeah, no, it's a heck of a commute.

10:07.983 --> 10:10.611
Tell you what.
How about I call my wife-- his mom,

10:10.694 --> 10:11.945
and then I'll see--

10:13.322 --> 10:14.573
She's pulling up right now?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.784
Okay, well, there you go. Crisis averted.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.579
Okay. All right now. Have fun. Bye.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.917
Everything okay?

10:25.542 --> 10:26.543
Yeah, yeah.

10:26.627 --> 10:29.338
No, Henry forgot his lunch today
for his field trip.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.548
But, no, Michelle's there.
So, yeah, we're all good.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.510
Hi, Keeley.

10:34.593 --> 10:36.762
You got to tell Roy
he needs to start coaching me.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.932
Wait. You want me to tell Roy Kent
what to do?

10:40.015 --> 10:42.434
-That's a great idea.
-Yeah, he's gonna love that.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.937
Yeah, I'll totally drop it
into one of our many conversations

10:45.020 --> 10:47.898
where Roy talks to me about his life
and asks for my advice.

10:52.486 --> 10:53.779
Philistines!

10:53.862 --> 10:55.781
-Philistines.
-I'm asking for help here.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.533
Jamie, you and Roy got your own history.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.409
Y'all got to get together and woman up.

11:00.744 --> 11:01.995
I think you mean man up, mate.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.707
No, y'all have been manning up
for a while. Look where that's got you.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.960
Keeley, you got any advice
for this young, half-dressed fella

11:08.043 --> 11:09.461
on how to get through to Roy?

11:09.545 --> 11:10.712
I agree.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.715
That's a confusing way to answer
that question. Am I wrong?

11:14.633 --> 11:16.051
No, I mean, I agree with Roy.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.470
Just agree
with everything that he throws at you.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.472
Really takes the anger wind
out of his brat sails.

11:21.974 --> 11:23.475
-Shall we?
-Yes, ma'am.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.562
-All right. Bon voyage.
-Bye, Jamie!

11:34.903 --> 11:36.405
I don't really know how to talk to you.

11:37.489 --> 11:38.866
Then it's working.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.663
You're gonna wanna look up "Philistines."

11:51.295 --> 11:54.965
You see, there comes a point
when you realize life is long,

11:55.048 --> 11:56.550
and it's also very short.

11:57.593 --> 11:59.344
And sometimes it's neither.

11:59.428 --> 12:03.473
But it is always what it is, you know?

12:04.141 --> 12:07.895
So, I looked him in the eye
and I said, "Paul, I'm leaving you.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.316
I'm gonna live my best life now,

12:12.399 --> 12:15.903
for as long as I can, until I die.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.197
Or until I'm murdered."

12:20.782 --> 12:23.493
And then I stood up, I flushed the toilet,

12:23.577 --> 12:26.830
I pulled up my trousers,
and I walked straight out of there.

12:26.914 --> 12:29.958
-That's incredible. Inspiring.
-Yeah.

12:30.042 --> 12:31.418
You should do a TED Talk.

12:31.502 --> 12:32.836
No, I agree.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.422
Yeah, 'cause right now you're getting
a whole heap of "Ted listen."

12:35.506 --> 12:37.216
-Yes!
-Nah! Rubbish!

12:37.299 --> 12:39.468
Come on! Come on!

12:39.551 --> 12:42.930
And can I just say, as someone
that's recently been divorced,

12:43.013 --> 12:46.475
the best piece of advice that I received
was to leave people well.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.894
-Oh, yeah. I completely agree. Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.855
It's slightly different in this case
because I'm the one doing the leaving.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.233
And as I understand it,
your wife left you?

12:57.319 --> 12:59.029
No, that is correct.
Big difference there, yeah.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.156
-That's terrible!
-What is that?

13:01.240 --> 13:03.867
Could you tell them to stop shouting
at the football?

13:03.951 --> 13:06.620
What football?
They're watching last night's Bake Off.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.747
-Look at that sponge!
-That's rubbish!

13:08.830 --> 13:11.083
Temper your chocolate, you twat!

13:13.418 --> 13:15.671
I'm sorry, would you excuse me?
This is my psychic.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.714
She said she'd call me
exactly when I needed her.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.677
That's incredible, isn't it?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.011
-Yeah.
-Wow.

13:23.095 --> 13:25.055
Hello, Tish. This is extraordinary.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.139
Tish.

13:26.223 --> 13:29.059
What a brave thing
for a woman of her age to do.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.727
Is she gonna move in with you?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.980
You should buy that Pilates machine,

13:33.063 --> 13:35.232
and then I can teach her
when I come over and use it.

13:35.315 --> 13:38.944
Please. Forget every word she just said.
They do this every couple of years.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.072
My dad acts up, then she leaves him.

13:42.155 --> 13:43.949
Then they "move on."

13:44.032 --> 13:47.160
Then he buys her some expensive,
environmentally conscious gift

13:47.244 --> 13:48.579
and they'll be back together in a week.

13:49.955 --> 13:53.208
But, hey-ho, she'll be paying the bill,
so do enjoy your free lunch.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.711
Well, I mean,
maybe it's different this time, you know?

13:55.794 --> 13:56.795
People can change.

13:57.379 --> 13:59.006
Some can. She can't.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.091
Poor little cake

14:01.175 --> 14:02.801
Soggy bottom

14:02.885 --> 14:06.263
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom

14:06.346 --> 14:09.933
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom

14:10.017 --> 14:13.520
Poor little cake
Soggy bottom…

14:26.366 --> 14:29.536
Hey. I was just thinking about you.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.829
What were you thinking?

14:31.663 --> 14:34.416
That if you ever left me again
I would throw myself off a cliff.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.503
And I'd lay down at the bottom
so you could land on me.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.254
Jane Pain.

14:41.298 --> 14:44.301
So, I'm going to Cafe Solo
to meet Finn for a coffee.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.554
That's cool.

14:48.805 --> 14:49.932
Who's Finn?

14:50.015 --> 14:53.227
My old uni friend. The underwear model.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.688
He wants to go through some shoot he did.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.149
I'll see you later. Bye!

15:18.961 --> 15:21.046
-Big man, Roy Kent.
-No.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.632
Come on, man. Why won't you coach me?

15:23.715 --> 15:25.092
Because you don't deserve it.

15:25.175 --> 15:26.510
You're right. I don't deserve it.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.679
And the way you play is dull
and conformist.

15:28.762 --> 15:33.267
It's true. I do play
in quite a dull and conformisty way.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.650
And you're ugly.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.781
You're an ugly, ugly boy.

15:49.408 --> 15:50.868
With bad hair.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.624
Say it.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.212
-I am…
-Yeah?

16:02.296 --> 16:06.425
I am an ugly, ugly boy…

16:09.261 --> 16:12.890
with hair that maybe could be slightly--

16:13.432 --> 16:15.225
With bad hair, fine!

16:19.688 --> 16:20.772
Cheers. I enjoyed that.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.611
-You fucking arsehole!
-Yeah. I know you are, but so are you.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.987
I'm trying to build bridges here.

16:27.070 --> 16:30.991
You couldn't fucking build Jeff Bridges.

16:31.074 --> 16:32.784
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on? What's wrong?

16:32.868 --> 16:34.244
This man refuses to coach me.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.205
He refuses to stop being an arsehole.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.539
Roy, you're not gonna like this.

16:37.623 --> 16:40.125
But right now,
Jamie here is being the mature one.

16:40.209 --> 16:43.170
It's true. I'm being super mature,
you big, dumb, hairy, baby twat.

16:43.253 --> 16:44.338
He just wants to learn from you.

16:44.421 --> 16:47.674
If you know how to make me better,
I want to hear it.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.842
See?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.595
Fine. I'll tell you what's wrong with you.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.930
All right, now. Here we go!

16:53.013 --> 16:54.723
You fucked him up.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.600
Okay. Expound.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.101
You've made him a team player.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.312
You've got him to pass and shit,

17:00.395 --> 17:02.689
and in doing so, you've made him average.

17:03.732 --> 17:08.403
'Cause, Jamie, deep down, at your core,

17:08.487 --> 17:10.571
you are a prick.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.659
So just be a prick.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.118
We need you to score more goals,

17:16.203 --> 17:18.579
and we need you
to get in the other teams' fucking heads

17:18.664 --> 17:21.583
and drive them up the fucking wall
like only you can fucking do.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.167
So I can go back to being a prick?

17:23.252 --> 17:26.755
No. I'm saying sometimes.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.590
When it is appropriate…

17:29.758 --> 17:32.219
yes, be a prick.

17:34.429 --> 17:35.514
Okay.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.516
How will I know when?

17:38.433 --> 17:40.310
I'm actually curious
about that myself too.

17:41.395 --> 17:42.479
We'll give you a signal.

17:45.691 --> 17:48.026
-What signal?
-Any specifics we need to look out for?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.070
You'll know it when you see it.

17:54.575 --> 17:55.576
Okay.

17:55.659 --> 17:57.244
Okay, that's good. All right.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.330
-You get that?
-He said you'll know it when you see it.

18:00.414 --> 18:01.456
So…

18:02.165 --> 18:04.293
you know, just keep your eyes peeled and…

18:14.511 --> 18:17.222
Stupid fuckin' shit.

18:41.997 --> 18:43.248
Hello, sausage.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.375
What time are you leaving
for the match today?

18:46.084 --> 18:49.630
-Three o'clock. Aren't you coming with me?
-No. No, no, don't worry.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.674
I'm meeting up
with Lavinia and Mary-Alice.

18:52.758 --> 18:55.802
We're going to hear Brené Brown
reading from her new book,

18:55.886 --> 18:58.722
Enter the Arena, But Bring a Knife.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.182
Okay.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.231
But I was thinking.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.485
When you come home,
I'd love to make you your favorite:

19:11.568 --> 19:13.529
shepherd's pie with cheesy top.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.741
And then you and I can have a proper chat.
How's that sound?

19:18.408 --> 19:19.618
Perfect.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.953
Perfect.

19:25.207 --> 19:29.503
AFC Richmond, a club who have never won
a major trophy in their history,

19:29.586 --> 19:31.672
suddenly find themselves one win away

19:31.755 --> 19:35.509
from an unlikely FA Cup semifinal
at Wembley Stadium.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.511
There's nothing like the FA Cup, Arlo.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.805
These are the games
you tell your grandchildren about.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.732
Where'd you get that?

19:50.816 --> 19:53.569
Some dodgy geezer outside the stadium.
It's not bad, eh?

19:53.652 --> 19:58.282
Their opponents, Tottenham Hotspur,
come to Nelson Road in dazzling form.

19:59.700 --> 20:03.287
I swear, if we actually win this match,
I will burn this pub to the ground.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.165
I will… knock over a chair.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.212
I will channel my raging enthusiasm
into ways to help my community.

20:12.296 --> 20:13.672
That's so good.

20:17.885 --> 20:20.220
-All right, here we go.
-Let's go!

20:30.397 --> 20:33.525
We've reached the 30-minute mark,
and it's still nil-nil,

20:33.609 --> 20:35.903
but it's been a corker of a game so far.

20:35.986 --> 20:39.448
Both sides are in all-out attack mode,
Arlo. It's a proper cup tie.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.457
Yes, yes, yes. Come on. Yes, yes, yes.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.043
Another wayward pass.

20:51.126 --> 20:54.379
And the baffling lack of aggression
from Tartt continues.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.007
I reckon it's time for the signal?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.550
-Yep.
-Yeah, okay.

20:58.634 --> 21:01.178
You didn't by any chance
come up with a better one, did you?

21:01.261 --> 21:02.471
No.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.390
All right. Hey, Jamie!

21:05.974 --> 21:07.142
Jamie!

21:14.233 --> 21:15.234
Come on!

21:18.654 --> 21:19.655
Yeah.

21:19.738 --> 21:22.074
Well, you don't see that
very often, Chris,

21:22.157 --> 21:23.742
especially in perfect unison.

21:23.825 --> 21:26.245
We apologize for the fruity sign language.

21:26.328 --> 21:28.872
It seems like Lasso has really
settled into our culture.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.874
He certainly has.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.254
Barnett, here's what's gonna happen, yeah.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.382
You're gonna foul me, and I'm gonna score
all the way from back here.

21:38.465 --> 21:39.466
Piss off, Tartt.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.146
Hey, referee!

21:59.695 --> 22:01.822
Okay. All right, here we go.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.242
Back it up, boys! Come on.

22:06.201 --> 22:08.287
-What'd I tell you, mate?
-You fucking--

22:08.370 --> 22:09.997
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!

22:12.332 --> 22:14.126
-Thank you!
-Send him off!

22:17.546 --> 22:19.256
Glad he's on our team, you know.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.010
Hey, what do you think? Trick play?

22:23.093 --> 22:25.637
You know, maybe a Loki's Toboggan
or Upside-Down Taxi?

22:25.721 --> 22:26.722
You don't need it.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.765
The little prick's gonna fucking score
from there.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.184
No way.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.461
It's too far.

23:10.891 --> 23:12.726
Yeah!

23:12.809 --> 23:13.852
Are you kidding me?

23:15.604 --> 23:16.688
Yes!

23:18.774 --> 23:20.275
Hey!

23:21.735 --> 23:24.154
Are you kidding me? Nice call!

23:24.238 --> 23:26.114
Yeah! How about that?

23:26.198 --> 23:28.325
Roy Kent effect right there.
That's what that is.

23:35.040 --> 23:37.292
Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

23:39.086 --> 23:40.629
Jamie Tartt, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

23:40.712 --> 23:41.839
Jamie Tartt!

23:41.922 --> 23:44.633
The first half ends with a shocking score

23:44.716 --> 23:47.511
that will reverberate
throughout English football.

23:47.594 --> 23:50.097
It's Richmond one, Tottenham nil.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.140
Chris, can Richmond hold on?

23:52.224 --> 23:53.976
If I were them,
I'd just leave the stadium,

23:54.059 --> 23:57.271
go off the grid, and just pretend that
we won the game until my dying breath.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.695
Your noise is back.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.697
What's up?

24:07.990 --> 24:11.660
I feel compelled to tell a friend
something he won't want to hear.

24:12.703 --> 24:13.996
Is this about Beard and Jane?

24:16.290 --> 24:19.334
I see her sometimes,
lurking around the car park.

24:19.418 --> 24:21.837
I mean, she's a bit intense,
but she's adorable.

24:22.963 --> 24:26.133
Like a tipsy Reese Witherspoon
playing Running Charades.

24:26.216 --> 24:28.594
-What's Running Charades?
-What's Running Charades?

24:28.677 --> 24:30.137
I have to say something.

24:30.220 --> 24:32.431
Absolutely not.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.558
Higgins, never interfere.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.518
It doesn't help,
and you'll only be punished for it.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.354
My parents should've split up years ago.

24:39.438 --> 24:42.441
When she first left him when I was at uni,
I congratulated her.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.651
Told her she deserved a better life.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.279
Two weeks later, they were back together,

24:47.362 --> 24:49.239
and she didn't speak to me
for nine months.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.617
It does no good.

24:51.700 --> 24:54.995
Well, I think if you care about someone,
you have to keep trying.

24:55.078 --> 24:56.538
Maybe one day you'll get through.

24:58.040 --> 24:59.541
You guys talking about Beard and Jane?

25:00.042 --> 25:01.752
She's quite the jealous type, right?

25:01.835 --> 25:05.589
She once followed me all the way home
just to ask if Beard was shagging Ted.

25:08.217 --> 25:09.426
Ten minutes to go,

25:09.510 --> 25:11.678
and since the amazing goal from Tartt,

25:11.762 --> 25:14.515
Spurs have completely
marked him out of the game.

25:15.432 --> 25:17.935
Richmond could pull off
an incredible upset,

25:18.018 --> 25:20.354
but they need to hold their nerve.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.711
You're better than that, Jamie!

25:46.046 --> 25:48.090
Jamie Tartt?

25:49.466 --> 25:51.176
Coach? You okay?

25:52.052 --> 25:53.428
Yeah, no, I'm--

25:54.346 --> 25:55.597
I gotta go. My stomach.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.727
What's happening?

26:01.311 --> 26:02.646
He said his stomach.

26:03.856 --> 26:05.274
He can't abandon the game.

26:05.357 --> 26:06.775
Well, we've seen this before.

26:06.859 --> 26:09.236
Lasso appears to be leaving?

26:09.319 --> 26:12.656
I know that run. That's the run
of a man who just ate a bad fish pie.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.533
Chris, is there a good fish pie?

26:20.873 --> 26:22.124
Wanker! Wanker!

26:22.207 --> 26:23.792
Wait, where the fuck's that twat going?

26:23.876 --> 26:25.419
Be kind. He looks poorly.

26:29.173 --> 26:30.549
And Spurs net the equalizer…

26:30.632 --> 26:31.675
Fuck!

26:31.758 --> 26:33.594
…with a towering header from Barnett.

26:33.677 --> 26:34.845
-Shit!
-I'll be right back.

26:34.928 --> 26:35.929
Okay.

26:38.056 --> 26:41.852
The Greyhounds were in disarray,
and Spurs took full advantage.

26:42.436 --> 26:43.729
For fuck's sake, Lasso!

26:43.812 --> 26:45.480
Every time I start to trust ya!

26:47.357 --> 26:49.693
-Roy, what do you think we should do?
-We need a fucking goal.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.445
What do we do? Put on a striker?

26:51.528 --> 26:52.988
Bring on Cockburn, take off Dixon.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.573
Park the bus.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.658
Or put Sam and go three up front?

26:56.742 --> 26:58.744
I don't--
We gotta be aggressive here, right?

26:59.244 --> 27:00.370
I think we need--

27:01.288 --> 27:04.208
Reynolds, Winchester, Babatunde,
you're going in.

27:06.168 --> 27:08.545
Hey! Colin, Dani, Richard,

27:09.505 --> 27:10.380
you're coming off.

27:10.464 --> 27:12.007
-Me?
-Yes, you, Colin.

27:12.090 --> 27:13.217
What's going on?

27:14.092 --> 27:15.802
-Park the bus!
-What?

27:15.886 --> 27:17.137
Park the bus!

27:17.221 --> 27:18.639
No one up front. Do it.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.225
-But we need a goal!
-Park the goddamn bus! Go!

27:22.100 --> 27:24.228
Park the bus! Park the bus!

27:25.062 --> 27:28.065
And it's a rare triple substitution
for Richmond.

27:28.148 --> 27:29.858
-Park the bus!
-Park the bus!

27:29.942 --> 27:31.652
-What's going on?
-I got this.

27:32.236 --> 27:34.530
Looks like
the coaching staff are panicking, Arlo.

27:34.613 --> 27:37.115
This is what a fish pie can do to a team.

27:39.243 --> 27:40.244
Ted?

27:40.327 --> 27:42.955
Stoppage time now,
and Richmond are completely dropping back.

27:43.038 --> 27:45.082
-They're playing very defensively.
-Ted?

27:45.165 --> 27:47.501
Richmond going for a draw
is a big mistake, Arlo.

27:47.584 --> 27:50.337
You're the underdog.
You're at home. You go for the win.

27:50.420 --> 27:53.048
-Wait, disaster for Spurs!
-Ted?

27:53.131 --> 27:56.969
A slip by Barnett and Richmond
are on the counterattack!

27:58.011 --> 28:01.265
Obisanya loops
a perfect diagonal ball to Tartt.

28:01.348 --> 28:02.975
He shoots!

28:03.058 --> 28:05.227
Tartt buries it in the back of the net!

28:05.310 --> 28:08.397
Richmond, impossibly, are on top!

28:14.069 --> 28:15.279
Oh, Ted.

28:23.579 --> 28:25.163
Yes!

28:29.084 --> 28:30.836
-Hey, boss. Congrats.
-Yeah.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.880
-Where's Ted?
-I don't know.

28:32.963 --> 28:35.007
A stomach thing.
I'll check in on my way home.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.258
Great. Thank you.

28:37.134 --> 28:39.136
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

28:39.219 --> 28:42.264
It's good to see
the Roy Kent effect is alive and well.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.183
Nothing to do with me. That is all Nate.

28:44.266 --> 28:46.268
We're Richmond till we die!

28:46.351 --> 28:49.563
We know we are! We're sure we are!
We're Richmond till we die!

28:51.231 --> 28:53.525
Congratulations on a thrilling win.

28:54.109 --> 28:55.402
Yeah, thank you. Thank you very much.

28:55.485 --> 28:57.362
-What happened to Ted?
-I don't know.

28:57.446 --> 28:58.530
Food poisoning or something?

28:58.614 --> 29:01.033
It seemed like a negative strategy
to pull everyone into defense

29:01.116 --> 29:02.117
when you needed a goal.

29:02.201 --> 29:03.744
Yes, but I knew they needed a goal too.

29:03.827 --> 29:05.495
As long as I made sure
they couldn't get through,

29:05.579 --> 29:07.414
at some point, human nature,
someone would screw up

29:07.497 --> 29:08.624
and we could exploit that.

29:08.707 --> 29:09.917
Brilliant!

29:10.000 --> 29:11.168
You said he was a lemon.

29:11.251 --> 29:13.962
-Impressive by an assistant coach.
-Just did what had to be done.

29:14.046 --> 29:15.964
It's not like
I'm some kind of "wonder kid."

29:16.048 --> 29:18.050
-Some kind of what?
-"Wonder kid."

29:18.133 --> 29:20.135
I think you mean wunderkind. Yeah?

29:21.178 --> 29:22.471
Yeah.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.139
Can we fix that with editing, or--

29:24.223 --> 29:25.432
No, we're live.

29:25.516 --> 29:28.852
Well, great job by Nathan Shelley,
the wonder kid.

29:28.936 --> 29:31.104
-And we wish Ted a speedy recovery.
-Yeah.

29:31.188 --> 29:33.690
-Thank you. Yeah.
-No, thank you. Thank you. Just go.

29:36.109 --> 29:39.488
As someone who cares about you,
I'm concerned that you and Jane are…

29:43.033 --> 29:44.785
Look, let me ask you one question.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.996
You're a great man.
Does Jane make you greater?

29:51.792 --> 29:53.752
Okay, look, I apologize.

29:59.925 --> 30:02.511
Okay, okay. That--

30:03.053 --> 30:04.805
I hear you. I get it.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.600
-We will never speak of this again.
-No, no.

30:12.521 --> 30:14.189
-See you Monday.
-See you Monday. Yep.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.035
I missed that scared face.

30:27.619 --> 30:28.912
I missed you too.

30:29.454 --> 30:30.539
How was Finn?

30:31.415 --> 30:32.875
He's like a Rembrandt.

30:32.958 --> 30:36.086
Beautiful to look at but so dim.

30:38.297 --> 30:39.339
Try this.

30:42.384 --> 30:44.303
-Yeah, much better. Yeah.
-Yeah?

30:44.386 --> 30:46.471
It's not too Oliver Twist?

30:46.555 --> 30:49.183
Well, it is,
but that's kind of my kink, so--

30:49.266 --> 30:50.851
"May I have some more?"

31:00.986 --> 31:03.947
Nate, great fucking work today.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.199
Thanks, Roy.

31:18.629 --> 31:19.963
Dr. Sharon!

31:20.047 --> 31:21.840
We're going for a drink. Will you join us?

31:21.924 --> 31:25.302
Wait, are we even allowed to talk to you
at night? If not, I'm so sorry.

31:25.928 --> 31:28.639
For a quarterfinal win,
you get me for one drink.

31:30.057 --> 31:31.350
I'll see you after.

31:41.193 --> 31:42.694
Wait for the beep.

31:42.778 --> 31:45.405
You gotta leave your name,
you gotta leave your number.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.407
Hey, Ted, it's me.

31:49.159 --> 31:51.745
I was a bit worried about you today.
Hope you're okay.

31:52.704 --> 31:56.500
If you need me,
just please do give me a call.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.211
It's just, I'm on my way home

31:59.294 --> 32:00.963
for a very difficult conversation
with my mother,

32:01.046 --> 32:03.507
and I could really do with
one of your pep talks.

32:04.675 --> 32:05.676
Anyway…

32:06.844 --> 32:07.928
take care.

32:16.478 --> 32:17.479
Mum!

32:21.733 --> 32:23.026
Mum!

32:26.154 --> 32:27.197
Mum?

32:35.038 --> 32:39.376
"Darling, sorry to miss you. Your father
apologized and bought me a new Tesla.

32:42.045 --> 32:44.047
I'll take you for a spin in it
next time I visit.

32:44.131 --> 32:47.384
PS, shepherd's pie is in the fridge.
Needs two minutes in the microwave."

33:06.528 --> 33:07.654
Hey, Luca.

33:08.405 --> 33:10.616
Yes, it's an actual phone call.

33:11.158 --> 33:12.618
No, I haven't been arrested.

33:13.202 --> 33:15.829
I just thought you'd like to know
that my parents are away.

33:16.371 --> 33:17.581
So we could--

33:18.248 --> 33:19.833
Exactly.

33:19.917 --> 33:21.001
See you soon.

33:34.848 --> 33:37.768
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman
Them boys up to something

33:37.851 --> 33:40.395
They just spent like two or three weeks
Out the country

33:40.479 --> 33:42.439
-You know all the lyrics.
-Them boys up to something

33:42.523 --> 33:44.107
They just not just bluffin'

33:44.691 --> 33:47.236
You don't have to call
I hit my dance like Usher

33:47.319 --> 33:50.113
-Oy, put your phone away, mate.
-Yes, yes, yes. Okay, okay. Sorry.

33:50.197 --> 33:51.198
Carry on going. You're great.

33:51.281 --> 33:54.368
I just found my tempo
Like I'm DJ Mustard

33:54.451 --> 33:57.746
I hit that Ginóbili
With my left hand up like

34:07.798 --> 34:08.924
Ted, you scared me.

34:13.303 --> 34:14.304
Are you okay?

34:18.891 --> 34:20.393
I wanna make an appointment.
