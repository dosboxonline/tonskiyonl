WEBVTT

00:11.929 --> 00:14.723
-Hello.
-Hi, Bridget. Sorry, I'm late.

00:14.806 --> 00:17.726
You know the only thing better
than a patient being late

00:17.809 --> 00:19.144
is one who doesn't turn up at all.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.189
So where did we leave off?

00:22.272 --> 00:26.276
Let's see.
I have it in my notes-- Oh, yeah!

00:26.360 --> 00:28.946
"Ted Lasso is driving me fucking crazy."

00:29.029 --> 00:31.365
All right. He refuses to open up.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.867
And when he gets anywhere close
to being vulnerable,

00:33.951 --> 00:38.247
he fires off a zinger or some obscure
reference to something very specific

00:38.330 --> 00:40.666
to a 40-year-old white man
from middle America.

00:40.749 --> 00:43.210
So he's refusing
to be vulnerable, right?

00:43.293 --> 00:45.045
Sounds like someone I know.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.756
Oh, stop it.
Me and Coach Lasso are nothing alike.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.967
Sharon, you do the same thing.

00:50.050 --> 00:53.971
He uses humor to deflect,
you use your intelligence.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.264
Please.

00:55.347 --> 00:58.725
I do not harness my savantish nature
to alienate people and isolate myself.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.353
Okay, I hear that.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.063
I doubt you'll make any headway
with Coach Lasso

01:04.147 --> 01:07.401
until you let your guard down yourself
and meet him halfway.

01:07.985 --> 01:08.986
You're right.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.321
Of course, I'm right!
Now, what are you going to do?

01:28.839 --> 01:30.883
-Mind your dog!
-What?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.467
-He hates that sweater.
-Up yours!

01:38.182 --> 01:39.600
Shit!

01:46.440 --> 01:49.234
Call 999. Someone call 999.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.019
Hi, guys.

02:26.313 --> 02:30.108
So, I actually have a fun,
new branding opportunity for a coach.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.486
It's only one public appearance.
It's decent money.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.530
Would be really good for the club.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.740
Would either one of you want
to help me out

02:36.823 --> 02:39.284
by being a spokesperson for this--

02:42.788 --> 02:45.082
Right. Fuck you both.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.044
I respect that we didn't
have to say a word.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.212
She gets us.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.215
I'm going to be a spokesperson.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.509
Where's Ted?

02:56.093 --> 02:58.679
-He texted. He has some emergency.
-What?

02:58.762 --> 03:00.722
-I didn't ask.
-Why not?

03:00.806 --> 03:02.140
It's his emergency.

03:02.224 --> 03:03.809
If he wanted him to know,
he would have said.

03:04.935 --> 03:07.980
We have an FA Cup semifinal
at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.773
-Who's running training?
-Me.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.526
-You?
-Ted asked. I don't give a shit.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.698
-Shit, I got to go.
-Where you going?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.449
None of your fucking business.

03:25.372 --> 03:28.208
Well…
Guess that just leaves us two. I mean--

03:28.292 --> 03:29.793
-You can run training.
-Thank you.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.171
That will be great-- I think--
Yes, thank you. Hold on.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.641
All right, man. Let's go.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.978
Switch it on, boy.
Yeah, let's go, let's go.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.646
Good man. All you, mate.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.690
That's it, you got it,
you got it, you got it.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.233
Hello, Daddy.

03:53.317 --> 03:55.986
Sam…
Do you know why I'm calling?

03:56.612 --> 03:57.821
No, sir.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.698
I'm calling because Cerithium Oil

03:59.781 --> 04:02.743
has just been ordered
to stop operating in Nigeria.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.579
Wait, what? Wait, that's incredible!

04:05.662 --> 04:08.790
And you were the butterfly
whose wings made this happen.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.626
I'm so proud of you, my son.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.002
Thank you, Dad.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.505
I mean, look, I only did it
because you inspired me to.

04:14.588 --> 04:18.382
I appreciate you saying that,
because it's absolutely true.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.761
I love you.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.055
I love you too. Okay, bye-bye.

04:23.889 --> 04:25.516
Oi! What you doing?

04:25.891 --> 04:27.142
Oh, shit.

04:28.894 --> 04:31.271
-Why didn't you say anything?
-It was on my neck.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.524
Yeah. Sorry.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.609
You know what, sod off.
I got this.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.664
I haven't found a term I like yet

04:48.747 --> 04:50.749
for when I tell people I'm taking a shit.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.751
What do you use?

04:55.128 --> 04:57.047
I need to reapply my lip liner.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.007
Men don't know what that means

04:59.091 --> 05:01.134
and women understand
it requires time and focus.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.811
Say fucking yes!

05:14.690 --> 05:17.401
Guys, guys! Three dots!
Three dots, three dots.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.200
Yes!

05:28.453 --> 05:29.872
Yeah!

05:29.955 --> 05:31.874
-Wow. Oh, my God.
-Yes!

05:33.917 --> 05:34.918
Captain.

05:35.544 --> 05:36.545
Yeah, bruv?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.589
I would like to ask you for a haircut.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.840
What?

05:44.386 --> 05:45.429
Are you sure, bruv?

05:45.512 --> 05:46.972
Yes, I think I am.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.647
All right. After training.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.611
-Isaac, Isaac.
-Oh, shit!

06:04.489 --> 06:05.490
Oh, now hold on, lady.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.826
You're telling me
I could shatter every bone in my body,

06:07.910 --> 06:10.370
someone could just drop me off
in front of any old hospital,

06:10.454 --> 06:11.997
dumped into a garbage can or something,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.666
and y'all patch me up
and I don't have to pay jack squat?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.168
You're damn right.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.003
I tell you, I love this country.
I love this town.

06:18.086 --> 06:22.007
Oh, did you know that Winnie the Pooh was
based on a real bear from the London Zoo?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.258
Fuck me.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.594
Oh, no…

06:26.428 --> 06:27.804
It's worse than I imagined.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.518
She can walk again!

06:33.644 --> 06:35.020
It's a miracle!

06:35.103 --> 06:37.022
Oh, thank God for science!

06:37.898 --> 06:40.192
Hey, Doc! The doc going to be okay, Doc?

06:40.275 --> 06:41.443
Yes, her scan seemed fine.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.278
Good. No intracranial hemorrhaging?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.781
-No.
-Or subdural hematoma?

06:45.864 --> 06:47.908
No. You seem to know
a lot about brain injuries.

06:47.991 --> 06:50.494
Well, I watched
a lot of Grey's Anatomy in my early 30s.

06:51.537 --> 06:53.205
And actually, you know,
I coached football.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.873
The American kind. You know?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.793
The one with all the concussions
and hullabaloo about kneeling and such.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.753
Oh, well, she does have a concussion.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.922
And she's had a couple stitches
in her head.

07:02.005 --> 07:04.299
So you'll need to rest
for a few days, okay?

07:04.383 --> 07:06.552
Apart from that,
your husband can take you home.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.970
Oh, he's not my husband.

07:08.053 --> 07:10.347
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ain't no ring on these fingers.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.932
-No, we're just friends.
-Colleagues.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.309
-Friendly colleagues.
-I don't have a husband.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.394
Yeah, but not in a sad way.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.521
You know, she's just fiercely independent.

07:17.604 --> 07:20.023
And I'm perfectly capable
of taking myself home.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.734
-See what I mean?
-I'm sorry, Dr. Fieldstone.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.070
Hospital policy states
that head trauma patients,

07:25.153 --> 07:26.321
they cannot leave unattended.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.907
And there ain't no policy
like a hospital policy,

07:28.991 --> 07:30.784
'cause a hospital policy don't stop.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.661
Let me help you out with that, sweetheart.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.872
-Here you go. There you go.
-Thank you.

07:35.497 --> 07:37.666
Thank you for being here, Coach Kent.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.836
My sister's at the hospital.
She works in the emergency room.

07:41.378 --> 07:43.422
She can't really pop out
'cause there's always someone coming in

07:43.505 --> 07:47.801
with, like, a knife stuck in their eye
or a torch stuck up their--

07:47.885 --> 07:49.636
Yeah, okay, I get it. She's busy.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.724
Phoebe, would you mind doing some coloring
while I talk to your uncle?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.392
Yes, Ms. Bowen.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.273
Can I start with
a quick personal question?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.442
-Phoebe's dad--
-Oh, he's a piece of shit.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.237
-Is he alive?
-Sorry, yeah. He's a living piece of shit.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.323
Right.

08:09.406 --> 08:13.118
Well, Coach Kent, we've got a bit of
an issue with Phoebe's behavior.

08:17.039 --> 08:20.292
-Let's have it.
-She's been swearing. A lot.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.460
How bad is it?

08:21.543 --> 08:25.881
Today she called one of her classmates
an "apathetic shitfucker."

08:26.465 --> 08:28.050
-Are they?
-Oh, yes.

08:28.634 --> 08:29.885
But that's not the point.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.722
Do you have any idea
where she might be getting this from?

08:39.352 --> 08:40.604
Me?

08:42.981 --> 08:45.984
Fuck.

08:46.068 --> 08:49.821
This was her fifth offense.
She got warnings, then isolation.

08:49.905 --> 08:52.449
Now I'm afraid she has to go home
for the rest of the day.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.785
You know the influence you have on her.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.370
Use it.

08:58.247 --> 08:59.831
Oi!

08:59.915 --> 09:00.916
We're leaving.

09:05.170 --> 09:07.130
Sorry for what I said, Ms. Bowen.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.757
Thank you, Phoebe.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.134
Uncle Roy, can we get ice cream?

09:11.718 --> 09:12.719
Fuck no!

09:14.471 --> 09:15.681
Sorry.

09:17.391 --> 09:18.600
F-no!

09:20.894 --> 09:23.105
Go on, scoot your boot.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.948
Fucking glitter.

09:34.533 --> 09:37.286
By all measures,
it's not the cruelest prank ever played,

09:37.369 --> 09:39.997
but no one should ever make someone
eat a Vaseline sandwich.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.790
But that's Ronnie Fouch for you.

09:41.874 --> 09:42.875
Innovator.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.252
How did you know I was in the hospital?

09:45.335 --> 09:48.547
Oh, you left me a bunch of voice notes.
Yeah, 32 to be exact.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.759
-I thought those deleted themselves.
-Yeah, well, I kept all those puppies.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.803
You should listen to some of these.
They are a hoot.

09:54.887 --> 09:57.681
-Please, no, thank you.
-It doesn't matter. I got them right here.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.393
Ted, it's Sharon.
I can't come to the phone right now.

10:01.476 --> 10:04.479
But if you want to talk my ear off
about some bullshit

10:04.563 --> 10:08.192
because you're too afraid
to properly emote, leave a message.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.068
Beep!

10:10.152 --> 10:12.988
-I didn't mean it.
-Come on now. You meant it a little bit.

10:13.071 --> 10:16.825
In concussio veritas, right?
Ain't that the saying?

10:16.909 --> 10:20.078
This next one brings
Mr. Stephen Sondheim in the house

10:20.162 --> 10:22.206
'cause it's you singing "Tonight"
from West Side Story,

10:22.289 --> 10:25.584
but doing both the parts of
Tony and Maria at the same time,

10:25.667 --> 10:28.003
which is, well, in a word, thrilling.
Here it is.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.338
Tonight, tonight

10:30.881 --> 10:31.882
Feel that.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.218
And you do the whole first act.
It's incredible.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.002
What is the big deal?

11:10.212 --> 11:11.547
Not now.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.383
My guy,
Isaac's an artist with those clippers.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.718
But he only gives you
one haircut per season,

11:16.802 --> 11:19.179
so you try and save that
for a very special occasion.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.973
I'm not using mine until I marry.

11:22.057 --> 11:23.183
Or I get circumcised.

11:23.267 --> 11:24.393
Quite right.

11:24.476 --> 11:27.020
Bro, I can't believe you're wasting
your Isaac cut on a blind date.

11:27.104 --> 11:29.815
Yeah. What if you and this babes
only got textual chemistry?

11:29.898 --> 11:30.899
Guys…

11:32.025 --> 11:33.026
I believe…

11:34.903 --> 11:36.530
this could be
something very special.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.622
So do we all just stand here--

11:45.706 --> 11:47.666
Oh, my God!

11:48.250 --> 11:50.502
Shut the fuck up, Jan Maas.

11:52.171 --> 11:53.172
Sorry.

12:01.096 --> 12:02.681
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.974
It's like Swan Lake.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.553
Oh! Yeah!

13:05.661 --> 13:06.662
Come in!

13:11.250 --> 13:12.251
Hi.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.420
What's this about?

13:16.004 --> 13:18.799
I'm just in here until my office exists.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.717
It's really no problem.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.179
If I spill anything,
I'm next to everything I need to clean up.

13:24.805 --> 13:25.931
This is very, very sad.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.308
What can I do for you, Jamie?

13:29.560 --> 13:32.396
Can I get me dad and his two mates
on the list for Wembley tickets, please?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.816
Of course! Family section? VIP?

13:35.899 --> 13:37.901
Put 'em in the car park for all I care.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.862
Just getting him tickets
so he'll get off me back.

13:40.571 --> 13:41.822
Fathers and sons.

13:41.905 --> 13:43.365
So tricky.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.659
They should really write songs about it.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.079
-Think they do.
-Yeah, I know. I was just--

13:50.372 --> 13:51.623
Anyway…

13:53.208 --> 13:56.461
You… Are you close with your dad?

13:56.962 --> 13:59.548
Ups and downs, like everyone.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.966
It's complicated.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.260
Mine's not complicated. He's just a dick.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.013
Every situation,
he does exactly what a dick would do.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.432
Not much you can do with that.
Know what I mean?

14:08.515 --> 14:12.728
Well, I try to love my dad for who he is
and forgive him for who he isn't.

14:14.855 --> 14:20.277
Look, Jamie. Whatever he may be,
he's your father, which makes him a VIP.

14:21.612 --> 14:22.946
Names?

14:23.030 --> 14:24.489
James Tartt.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.746
His mates are Denbo Cullens and Bug.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.666
-"Bug"?
-Just Bug. One G.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.918
Like the animal.

14:36.460 --> 14:37.920
It's his legal name. Changed it.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.005
Because he's small like a bug?

14:40.088 --> 14:41.715
No, 'cause he eats bugs for money.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.217
Right.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.345
Thanks for that.

14:46.428 --> 14:47.513
Yeah.

14:47.596 --> 14:48.597
Okay.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.432
Open or closed?

14:51.433 --> 14:52.559
Closed.

14:52.643 --> 14:53.810
You get less questions.

14:54.770 --> 14:56.396
-All right.
-Bye.

15:02.903 --> 15:04.613
Thank you for the ice cream, Uncle Roy.

15:05.656 --> 15:06.907
Oi!

15:13.288 --> 15:14.831
You can't swear, Phoebe.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.917
But you swear all the time.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.085
Yeah.

15:18.168 --> 15:21.547
And it didn't hold me back
'cause I'm a footballer.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.092
No one cares if we swear.
It's part of the job. It's encouraged.

15:26.552 --> 15:30.097
But you can't be a doctor,
or a teacher, or a--

15:30.180 --> 15:32.266
Veterinarian for wild animals.

15:32.349 --> 15:35.185
Or a veterinarian for wild animals.
I still don't get how that works.

15:35.269 --> 15:37.020
You treat them in the woods
and no one pays you?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.105
It doesn't matter.

15:38.188 --> 15:42.860
The point is you can't do that
if you swear all the time.

15:46.196 --> 15:49.491
Look. You and I spend
a lot of time together,

15:50.075 --> 15:51.493
and I love every second.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.081
I weren't trained
in how to be around a kid.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.626
And sometimes…

16:00.878 --> 16:02.504
I get concerned…

16:05.465 --> 16:10.387
that I've been infecting you
with the worst parts of me.

16:10.971 --> 16:12.681
That's not true.

16:13.515 --> 16:16.268
Uncle Roy, you teach me great things.

16:17.144 --> 16:19.605
I called that boy a name
because he's a bully.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.608
And because of you, I stand up to bullies.

16:25.694 --> 16:26.695
And referees.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.241
And I can do that without swearing.

16:31.950 --> 16:32.951
Yeah.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.329
'Cause you are better than me.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.664
I'm as good as the best you.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.418
Maybe we can stop swearing together.

16:41.502 --> 16:42.878
Fuck you.

16:44.296 --> 16:45.297
I can't.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.174
But you can.

16:49.676 --> 16:50.969
Pretty please.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.471
Okay, Uncle Roy.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.516
Good. Now get out of here.

16:55.599 --> 16:59.019
Can you come in
for one game of Princess and Dragon?

16:59.603 --> 17:01.230
Can I be the dragon this time?

17:01.313 --> 17:02.731
No.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.025
Fine. But you better have fixed the wand.

17:09.154 --> 17:11.365
All right. Tight squeeze, huh?

17:11.448 --> 17:13.867
Probably a little bit easier
when this thing can fold up, I bet.

17:13.951 --> 17:16.203
Thank you for walking me home.
I'm good from here.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.454
Well, that's the fifth time
you've said that.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.874
I'll just set this puppy down
and I'll skedaddle.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.377
Yeah, there you go.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.171
Good spot for it. There you go.

17:31.802 --> 17:32.928
Corporate housing, huh?

17:33.011 --> 17:34.805
It does not disappoint, does it?

17:34.888 --> 17:37.766
It don't really do anything.
I guess that's part of the idea, ain't it?

17:37.850 --> 17:39.810
What we got back here? Hey.

17:40.769 --> 17:43.146
All right. Home entertainment center.

17:43.981 --> 17:47.943
Well, you know what,
I'll just say that it's fine and move on.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.319
It's temporary.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.530
Yeah, well, you know, what isn't, right?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.700
-Would you like some tea?
-Oh, hell no.

17:55.409 --> 17:59.413
No, I mean no, thank you.
Sorry, just don't care for that garbage.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.956
I have water and I have wine.

18:01.039 --> 18:03.083
Chicken and the egg, huh? Yeah.

18:03.166 --> 18:05.210
I'll take some water.
That'd be great. Thanks.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.004
Tap okay?

18:07.087 --> 18:11.216
Oh, yeah. No, I like my water
like Kyrie Irving likes his Earth. Flat.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.935
So, you gonna get a new bike,
or you wanna lay off riding for a bit?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.896
I don't know. I haven't thought about it.

18:23.979 --> 18:27.399
Well, I hope you get back on that horse.
And by horse, I mean bicycle.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.569
Although how cool would it be
if you started riding a horse to work?

18:30.652 --> 18:32.487
Everybody starts calling you
"Dr. Sharon Horsewoman" or--

18:32.571 --> 18:33.864
You know, becomes your hook.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.741
I really should get some rest.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.911
Hey, 10-4, good buddy. Good colleague.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.306
Delicious as always.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.561
Yeah, all right, no,
I'll let you go here, and--

19:04.645 --> 19:06.772
You just give me a holler
if you need anything.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.690
You know, you had quite the scare today.

19:08.774 --> 19:12.361
And my job is teaching people
how to overcome what happened to me.

19:12.444 --> 19:13.779
I'm fine, thank you.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.072
Goodbye, Coach Lasso.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.660
Yeah, all right now, Doc. Take care.

19:41.431 --> 19:42.891
Jesus! Hello.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.978
Why are you picking up right now?

19:46.061 --> 19:47.646
You were supposed to be in there
five minutes ago.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.606
Right. I can't go in.

19:49.690 --> 19:52.401
Oh, come on.
You've got this. Get in there.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.570
Either it's gonna be
the most amazing night

19:54.653 --> 19:55.946
or it's gonna be so shit

19:56.029 --> 19:58.782
that you can punish me for it
for the rest of our friendship.

19:59.408 --> 20:00.784
I do like the sound of that.

20:00.868 --> 20:03.078
I'm gonna hang up
'cause you're gonna go, yeah?

20:04.162 --> 20:06.915
You look so beautiful I can't bear it.

20:19.553 --> 20:21.847
Ms. Welton. Rebecca.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.390
Sam!

20:23.473 --> 20:26.768
-Hi. Hello.
-Well, that's a coincidence.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.272
What's-- What's wrong?

20:30.355 --> 20:32.482
What? Oh, God. Yeah, I'm fi-- I'm just--

20:32.566 --> 20:36.695
I'm just a little bit nervous
'cause I'm meeting someone.

20:36.778 --> 20:38.155
Okay, well, I--

20:38.238 --> 20:43.202
Don't be nervous,
'cause you look stunning as always.

20:43.702 --> 20:45.078
Thank you, Sam.

20:45.162 --> 20:47.497
Oh, God, don't let me
get in the way of--

20:47.581 --> 20:50.042
-You have a lovely evening.
-Yes. Thank you. You too.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.168
Great haircut.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.921
-Oh. Well, thank you.
-Yes.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.422
That's just weird.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.440
Keeley says hi.

21:14.066 --> 21:16.318
Oh… tell her I say hello.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.632
Oh, shit!

21:38.715 --> 21:39.842
-What?
-Shit.

21:39.925 --> 21:40.884
-What?
-Shit.

21:40.968 --> 21:43.262
-What? What? What?
-Shit. God, this can't be happening!

21:43.345 --> 21:46.265
-But it is. It's--
-I knew I shouldn't have come in here.

21:46.348 --> 21:48.851
-But you did. You d--
-No. Sam.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.854
We can't-- I'm your boss.

21:53.063 --> 21:57.609
No. No. You are way too young.
I mean, you're what, like, 24?

21:57.693 --> 22:00.195
-I'm-- I'm 21.
-Oh, my God. I'm a pedophile.

22:00.279 --> 22:03.323
I feel-- I've groomed you.
All these messages. I was grooming you!

22:03.407 --> 22:06.034
You didn't groom me, okay?
We didn't know who we were.

22:06.118 --> 22:09.538
Okay, but-- but now we do,
and this is not happening.

22:09.621 --> 22:14.001
No, this can't happen.
And this never happened, okay?

22:15.169 --> 22:18.839
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:18.922 --> 22:20.424
We-- We can-- We can still have--

22:20.507 --> 22:24.303
-Sorry. Sorry.
-Hello. Hi. Sorry.

22:26.054 --> 22:30.434
Listen, we can still have dinner. Okay?
It doesn't have to be a date.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.644
We-- It can just be a funny coincidence

22:32.728 --> 22:36.982
that we both happened to turn up
to the same fabulous restaurant,

22:37.065 --> 22:39.276
both of us alone…

22:40.694 --> 22:42.738
and hungry.

22:44.656 --> 22:45.908
That can happen.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.285
Right?

22:51.788 --> 22:53.332
I mean, I am quite hungry.

23:31.495 --> 23:34.498
…to Lust Conquers All Stars.

23:34.581 --> 23:38.627
Our winning couples from previous seasons
will put their love to the test.

23:38.710 --> 23:41.880
Will it be
last season's winners Ellie and Danthony,

23:42.714 --> 23:44.174
or season one's winners…

23:44.258 --> 23:45.759
Hello, Coach Lasso.

23:45.843 --> 23:50.055
Hey, Doc. So tonight I'm just gonna
keep checking in on you every 20 minutes.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.849
It's standard concussion protocol,

23:51.932 --> 23:54.226
but I'm gonna change my voice
every time I call you

23:54.309 --> 23:55.727
so it stays exciting for you.

23:55.811 --> 23:57.729
Have you been feeling dizzy or nauseous?

23:59.273 --> 24:01.275
That's what it sounds like when you laugh.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.194
I'm fine, Coach Lasso.

24:05.404 --> 24:08.198
Then I'll talk to you in twenty minutes.
Sling Blade.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.576
Hey, Ted…

24:10.659 --> 24:11.952
Yes.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.122
I was scared today. Really scared.

24:17.416 --> 24:20.169
I love riding my bike.
It's my happy place.

24:20.252 --> 24:27.092
And after today, I was worried
I'll be too scared to enjoy riding again.

24:28.552 --> 24:30.596
I would say
that fear's a lot like underwear.

24:30.679 --> 24:34.224
No, I don't want to discuss it.
I don't need a pep talk.

24:34.892 --> 24:37.561
Ted, I just wanted to tell you
how I was feeling.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.063
Well, I appreciate it. Means a lot.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.149
And I'm glad I did it.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.901
Good luck this weekend.

24:49.323 --> 24:50.657
Okay, A-C-M,

24:50.741 --> 24:53.327
I don't know who you are,
but I am coming after your A-S-S.

24:53.410 --> 24:54.411
Let's go.

24:54.494 --> 24:55.495
All right.

24:57.581 --> 24:59.166
Oh, God. It's a bottomless pit.

24:59.249 --> 25:00.751
I commend you.

25:00.834 --> 25:04.004
Usually women use
those small handheld purses on dates.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.672
-What do they call it?
-A clutch.

25:05.756 --> 25:07.174
Clutch.

25:07.257 --> 25:09.801
No, I'd rather dig for dinosaur bones

25:09.885 --> 25:12.513
rather than have one of those bags
you can't fit your phone in.

25:13.096 --> 25:15.265
-There you go.
-And this was not a date.

25:16.183 --> 25:17.184
I know.

25:18.685 --> 25:19.811
So…

25:22.564 --> 25:24.399
can we not do this again sometime?

25:25.859 --> 25:27.778
I'm going in alone.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.450
Okay.

25:44.586 --> 25:47.464
No, no. Nev-- never again, Sam.

25:48.715 --> 25:49.716
I mean it.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.011
I have to mean it.

25:54.137 --> 25:56.390
Yeah, yeah, of course. You're right.

25:57.724 --> 26:00.477
-Besides, we have a big game on Sunday.
-Right.

26:00.561 --> 26:02.437
We both need our rest.

26:02.521 --> 26:03.730
Yep.

26:04.773 --> 26:05.774
Good.

26:10.112 --> 26:11.613
-Good night.
-Thank you.

26:16.285 --> 26:17.286
Oh, bloody hell.

26:19.913 --> 26:21.123
Bloody hell.

27:07.002 --> 27:08.504
Gentlemen. Focus up.

27:10.255 --> 27:12.508
All right, fellas,
I want you to close your eyes.

27:13.217 --> 27:14.426
Look around.

27:15.260 --> 27:18.680
You know.
I mean, open them up and take it all in.

27:19.473 --> 27:25.646
But remember, this right behind me,
just a regular old football pitch.

27:26.230 --> 27:28.315
You take away the stadium
and all the stands,

27:28.398 --> 27:33.028
I think you'll find it's the same size
as our pitch back home on Nelson Road.

27:33.111 --> 27:35.030
-Not exactly.
-What's that?

27:35.113 --> 27:36.823
It's 500 square yards bigger.

27:36.907 --> 27:39.326
-Really? The pitches aren't the same size?
-No.

27:39.409 --> 27:42.204
-This is the biggest pitch in the country.
-Huge advantage for City.

27:42.287 --> 27:46.625
Boy, oh, boy. This sport has
the loosiest-goosiest rules of all.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.210
Tough to get my head around sometimes.
Okay.

27:48.293 --> 27:50.546
All right. It's bigger.

27:50.629 --> 27:54.049
And, look, I know y'all grew up
watching games on this field,

27:54.132 --> 27:56.009
so you're probably a little nervous.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.678
Shoot, I know I got goose bumps.

27:58.262 --> 28:00.556
I remember being a little kid,
sitting in front of the television

28:00.639 --> 28:03.642
and watching Queen perform
right over there during Live Aid.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.602
-No, you didn't.
-That was old Wembley.

28:05.686 --> 28:07.396
That field was even bigger.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.480
It doesn't matter.

28:08.564 --> 28:13.068
Point is, guys, we're here now, okay?

28:13.151 --> 28:14.152
At this Wembley.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.656
The one that Freddie Mercury
never stepped foot in.

28:18.323 --> 28:20.117
And this is our day to make history.

28:20.534 --> 28:22.244
And I believe we're gonna do just that.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.914
Go ahead, take one more glance,
then let's head back in.

28:25.998 --> 28:26.999
We got work to do.

28:40.220 --> 28:42.764
Richmond!

29:01.366 --> 29:02.701
City! City!

29:04.828 --> 29:06.955
-City!
-City!

29:07.039 --> 29:08.749
Yes! Come on!

29:09.708 --> 29:10.959
Look at this. Not bad, is it?

29:11.043 --> 29:14.338
Well, well, well.
Hey, these are bang tidy seats these, man.

29:14.421 --> 29:17.466
That's what you get
when your son's playing in the semifinals.

29:18.050 --> 29:21.470
It's not for the right fucking team,
but what can you do, eh?

29:21.553 --> 29:23.514
Here you are. Get on that, kiddo.

29:25.641 --> 29:28.310
We win this match,
we get Richmond tattoos.

29:28.393 --> 29:29.394
Already got one.

29:30.187 --> 29:32.648
-Where?
-Mind your fucking business.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.817
I'm just not sure how this can…

29:35.901 --> 29:37.611
What about if they have
the game of their lives?

29:37.694 --> 29:39.488
Oh, yeah. I was hoping for that.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.079
You good, Coach?

29:48.789 --> 29:49.998
Oh, yeah.

29:50.082 --> 29:54.211
I'm just doing some breathing exercises
that Doc taught me, that's all.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.672
Hope it's not stomach problems again.

29:56.755 --> 29:58.966
Tell me you didn't eat the prawn cocktail.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.050
No, never.

30:02.010 --> 30:03.262
Guys, it's time.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.099
Here we go. Come on.

30:08.642 --> 30:10.602
Hey, fellas, hold on a sec.

30:10.686 --> 30:12.980
I need to tell you all something.

30:14.314 --> 30:15.816
When I left the match against Tottenham,

30:15.899 --> 30:19.611
it-- it wasn't 'cause, you know,
my stomach was bothering me.

30:21.196 --> 30:23.156
It was 'cause I had a panic attack.

30:27.077 --> 30:29.413
I've been having them
from time to time as of late,

30:29.496 --> 30:30.497
and I'm working on it.

30:31.206 --> 30:34.209
But I just want you all to know the truth.

30:37.004 --> 30:38.005
We good?

30:38.088 --> 30:40.340
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah. Of course.

30:40.424 --> 30:42.676
Okay. Okay, all right.
All right, let's go get 'em.

30:44.303 --> 30:45.596
-Richmond on three.
-Wait!

30:48.974 --> 30:51.059
I need to confess something too.

30:53.228 --> 30:56.565
I messed up the time zones
on our transfer deadline,

30:56.648 --> 31:00.235
which is why we didn't sign up
that amazing fullback from Brazil.

31:00.319 --> 31:01.361
Oh, my God.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.739
-That's okay.
-Okay.

31:03.822 --> 31:05.115
-Yeah, okay.
-All good.

31:06.783 --> 31:08.744
-Okay.
-That's all right. Yeah.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.245
Okay. Here we go.

31:10.329 --> 31:13.165
I don't read the scouting reports
you guys write.

31:13.248 --> 31:14.875
I've lied every time they've come up.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.877
They're boring, and I won't do it.

31:20.380 --> 31:21.423
I appreciate that.

31:22.758 --> 31:26.136
I pretend to get ideas in the moment,

31:26.220 --> 31:28.096
but they're just good ideas
I've had for months.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.890
I just time them to look spontaneous.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.266
It's a good move.

31:32.059 --> 31:33.519
Illusion of the first time.

31:33.602 --> 31:36.271
There was one game this season
where I was accidentally on mushrooms.

31:37.314 --> 31:38.482
"Accidentally"?

31:38.565 --> 31:42.110
I'd been at Jane's house,
and I drank tea from the wrong pot.

31:43.362 --> 31:44.738
The Port Vale match?

31:45.781 --> 31:46.949
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:47.491 --> 31:48.867
It won't happen again.

31:50.577 --> 31:51.578
Thanks, guys.

31:54.248 --> 31:55.290
Thank you.

31:55.374 --> 31:57.501
-All right, let's go kick their butts.
-Butts on three.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.586
-Works for me. One, two, three.
-Butts!

32:03.257 --> 32:05.342
You all fancy now, drinking tea, huh?

32:05.425 --> 32:07.010
I didn't know how to tell you.

32:10.430 --> 32:14.351
Wembley Stadium,
the Taj Mahal of English football.

32:14.434 --> 32:17.855
The setting
for every young footballer's dreams.

32:17.938 --> 32:22.901
A sporting battlefield,
pockmarked with the footprints of giants.

32:22.985 --> 32:27.364
Hoping to add another upset
to this fabled ground's storied list,

32:27.447 --> 32:29.366
humble AFC Richmond.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.618
Never won a major trophy.

32:31.702 --> 32:35.289
The last London club
to make their Wembley debut.

32:35.372 --> 32:40.169
Renewing hostilities against
the undisputed greatest team in the land,

32:40.252 --> 32:42.337
the mighty Manchester City.

32:42.421 --> 32:43.922
It was only 11 months ago

32:44.006 --> 32:48.594
this Richmond side were relegated by City
in heartbreaking fashion.

32:48.677 --> 32:52.931
Jamie Tartt was a City player then,
and he helped send Richmond down.

32:53.640 --> 32:57.853
Then City sent him down the M40,
and he's a Greyhound again.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.481
Come on! Come on!

33:02.065 --> 33:05.986
City are after another trophy.
Richmond are after revenge.

33:06.570 --> 33:11.909
It's ready to blow,
it's under the arch, it's Wembley Stadium.

33:11.992 --> 33:16.038
It's the FA Cup semifinal,
and it starts now.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.923
-Goal Manchester City!
-Fuck!

33:26.924 --> 33:28.050
No!

33:28.133 --> 33:30.886
-How's that not offside?
-'Cause he was only passively offside.

33:32.054 --> 33:34.389
I don't get this frigging rule still.
That's all right.

33:34.473 --> 33:36.767
-We're okay, guys!
-It's a corner kick for City.

33:37.476 --> 33:38.519
And a goal!

33:38.602 --> 33:40.687
-Fuck!
-It's 2-nil.

33:41.188 --> 33:42.147
Oh, 2-nil!

33:43.148 --> 33:44.483
Shit!

33:44.566 --> 33:45.859
This free kick could be dangerous.

33:45.943 --> 33:47.694
And it is. It's 3-nil.

33:48.362 --> 33:50.948
They'll be searching for solutions
on the Richmond bench.

33:51.031 --> 33:52.032
Defend!

33:52.616 --> 33:54.910
-We've got to go three attackers--
-No. It's never too late to park the bus.

33:54.993 --> 33:57.037
-It is too late.
-Guys, one at a time, please.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.373
Okay, don't worry about it.
Hey, it's okay.

33:59.456 --> 34:01.416
Can Richmond turn it around
in the second half?

34:03.919 --> 34:07.589
Oh, no. It's an own goal. And it's 4-nil.

34:07.673 --> 34:10.050
Come on, boys!
You can do better than this!

34:10.132 --> 34:12.386
This is when you start looking
for someone to blame.

34:12.469 --> 34:15.304
Hey, ref! Clean the shit out of your eyes,
you dickless wonder.

34:16.473 --> 34:18.934
Oh, no. Never mess with Mike Dean.

34:20.060 --> 34:21.353
Can't say that, mate. I'm sorry.

34:22.437 --> 34:23.688
There you go.

34:23.772 --> 34:25.899
Sorry about that, Mike.
We all know you have a penis.

34:25.983 --> 34:27.025
I've been called worse.

34:29.945 --> 34:31.446
All right, here we go! We got it!

34:34.366 --> 34:35.534
And it's a penalty.

34:35.617 --> 34:36.784
-Referee!
-What was it?

34:37.244 --> 34:38.245
What is that?

34:41.581 --> 34:45.502
And City remove any shred of doubt
to the outcome of this match.

34:45.585 --> 34:48.005
If this was a fight,
they would stop it.

34:48.088 --> 34:51.300
Frankly, Arlo, all fights should be
stopped before they even start.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.553
God fucking damn it.

34:54.636 --> 34:56.429
Come on now, Coach. It is what it is.

34:56.513 --> 34:58.265
Yeah. It is what it is.

35:02.936 --> 35:05.355
Hey, Jamie!
You can score one now.

35:05.439 --> 35:07.608
Fill your boots! Go on!

35:15.490 --> 35:17.784
The only nice thing I can say
about Richmond today

35:17.868 --> 35:21.580
is that Sam Obisanya's hair
looks absolutely fantastic.

35:22.623 --> 35:24.791
City move on
to play Leicester in the final.

35:25.375 --> 35:27.628
And you can be sure
Richmond's disappointment

35:27.711 --> 35:32.382
hangs heaviest on the head of
a devastated Jamie Tartt.

35:35.511 --> 35:36.678
It's on me arse.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.184
All right. Okay. So…

35:42.768 --> 35:45.979
So, Sam, how did it feel
to lose that badly out there today?

35:51.360 --> 35:52.361
Well, it's tough.

35:53.612 --> 35:57.157
It's tough.
I feel sorry that we let the fans down.

36:05.165 --> 36:08.460
There's nothing you can say.
It is what it is. It's a write-off.

36:08.544 --> 36:09.878
We start again tomorrow.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.131
Mr. Tartt.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.634
You have a visitor.

36:16.844 --> 36:18.136
Says he's your father.

36:20.722 --> 36:21.723
Yeah.

36:22.850 --> 36:24.017
Are you decent?

36:26.937 --> 36:28.522
I told ya. Dick.

36:29.690 --> 36:31.650
Oh, gentlemen! Gentlemen!

36:33.735 --> 36:37.114
Hey, it's a tough one, lads.
It's a tough one, but no shame to it,

36:37.197 --> 36:41.118
'cause, you know,
we only ever beat everybody we play.

36:42.619 --> 36:44.246
So you pups had no chance.

36:46.248 --> 36:47.916
And there he is, my son.

36:49.126 --> 36:50.669
My own flesh and blood.

36:51.420 --> 36:52.588
Poor Jamie, my son.

36:54.339 --> 36:57.176
Now, maybe I'm thinking
his heart's still in Manchester

36:57.259 --> 36:59.595
and that's why he missed that sitter
in the first half.

37:02.806 --> 37:05.934
You absolutely balled it. You balled it.

37:06.018 --> 37:09.771
What were you thinking?
I'm only kidding, hey.

37:10.772 --> 37:15.235
Hey, look, do us a favor
and get Denbo and Bug past security.

37:15.319 --> 37:17.696
They wanna go on the pitch,
take a few snaps, yeah?

37:18.906 --> 37:19.907
I'd rather 'em not.

37:19.990 --> 37:22.659
Yeah, they just want to look around.
It'll only take a second.

37:23.702 --> 37:25.329
I'd rather 'em not.

37:25.412 --> 37:26.663
What?

37:27.247 --> 37:29.416
What, you're not gonna all go
little moody bitch

37:29.499 --> 37:31.543
just 'cause you got your arse
served to you on a plate, are ya?

37:31.627 --> 37:33.337
Don't speak to me like that.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.005
Don't speak to me like that.

37:35.589 --> 37:36.715
Don't speak to me like that.

37:38.175 --> 37:40.135
Okay, well, let's see
if you can hear this.

37:40.969 --> 37:44.681
You know that ickle TV show you made?

37:44.765 --> 37:48.268
You made it easier for Manchester City
to kick you to the curb.

37:49.269 --> 37:50.687
And look where you are now.

37:51.313 --> 37:55.359
Twaddling about with a bunch of amateurs.
No offense, no offense.

38:00.656 --> 38:02.616
Don't turn your back on me,
you pussy.

38:07.287 --> 38:08.872
Jesus. God.

38:12.334 --> 38:13.544
Oh, yeah. Okay.

38:13.627 --> 38:15.003
You can have that one for free.

38:15.087 --> 38:18.048
-Time to go.
-You wanna go? Let's have it.

38:18.131 --> 38:20.634
-Don't you forget where you came from.
-Watch the door.

38:21.844 --> 38:22.845
Oops.

39:34.750 --> 39:35.959
Hello, Coach Lasso.

39:36.418 --> 39:37.836
Sorry about the loss.

39:38.378 --> 39:40.631
Oh, and thank you for the new bicycle.

39:41.173 --> 39:43.884
It's very kind, but unnecessary.

39:46.553 --> 39:47.596
Coach Lasso?

39:50.849 --> 39:54.269
My father killed himself when I was 16.

39:56.772 --> 40:00.776
That happened to me and to my mom.

40:03.570 --> 40:04.947
I'm so sorry, Ted.

40:05.697 --> 40:09.451
And look, I don't know if that's where
maybe some of my issues stem from.

40:09.535 --> 40:11.537
No, it definitely is.

40:11.620 --> 40:13.038
Right. That makes sense.

40:16.124 --> 40:17.751
Do you want to talk about it now?

40:20.420 --> 40:23.799
No. No, not right now.
I need to get back inside to the team.

40:23.882 --> 40:25.092
I just wanted you to know.

40:27.511 --> 40:30.055
Okay, thank you for telling me, Ted.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.349
Please call if you need me.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.433
I will.

40:34.476 --> 40:35.978
I will, I'm sorry. I will.

40:36.061 --> 40:38.480
It's okay. Good night, Ted.

40:47.364 --> 40:48.532
Hey, Coach!

40:50.409 --> 40:51.410
Yeah?

40:55.330 --> 40:56.331
You good?

40:56.415 --> 40:59.042
Oh, yeah. Yeah, no--
I just had a quick phone call.

41:01.628 --> 41:04.047
-That was a rough night, huh?
-Yeah.

41:04.131 --> 41:05.340
Okay, what do you--

41:06.550 --> 41:09.469
What do you say
we make like Schreiber and Liev, huh?

41:09.553 --> 41:11.555
About that…

41:12.806 --> 41:16.059
I don't want to ride back with you guys.
I'd rather go shake this off.

41:18.270 --> 41:20.189
Yeah, sure, no. Of course.

41:20.272 --> 41:21.273
You wanna join me?

41:21.773 --> 41:24.484
Well, you know I promised Henry
I'd FaceTime him.

41:24.568 --> 41:27.404
They had a recital at his school,
and I wanna hear how it went.

41:27.487 --> 41:30.115
I'll take a rain check.
All right? Yeah.

41:30.199 --> 41:34.077
Hey. Hey, hey,
just be careful out there, all right?

41:35.329 --> 41:36.330
-Yeah.
-Okay.

41:36.788 --> 41:38.749
And don't forget tomorrow.

41:39.458 --> 41:42.461
It's your turn
for coffee at the game film.

41:42.544 --> 41:43.670
-Yeah.
-Bright and early.

41:48.300 --> 41:50.052
Hey, Coach, bird by bird.

41:53.263 --> 41:54.598
Not that kind of bird, but…

42:32.970 --> 42:35.806
Earlier,
Manchester City routed AFC Richmond

42:35.889 --> 42:40.519
in the FA Cup 5-nil
with a parade of fantastic goals.

42:41.687 --> 42:44.982
And Goliath
has put David back in his place.

42:45.065 --> 42:47.401
Here's Sam Obisanya postgame.

42:48.235 --> 42:51.655
Well-- well, it's-- it's tough.
It's tough…

42:52.656 --> 42:54.491
I feel sorry that we let the fans down.

42:55.242 --> 42:57.202
We lost. Very badly.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.247
But we tried.

43:00.873 --> 43:02.416
We gave it everything we had,

43:02.499 --> 43:07.796
and for me, that is okay
because what's worse is not to try at all.

43:08.547 --> 43:11.925
To try is scary, you know,
because you can end up losing a lot.

43:12.801 --> 43:14.845
But you have to put your heart out there.

43:16.346 --> 43:17.764
Otherwise, what's the point?

43:20.100 --> 43:21.101
Thank you.

44:06.104 --> 44:07.105
Yeah.

44:21.995 --> 44:23.830
Why did you send me your address?

44:24.498 --> 44:25.499
For next time.
