WEBVTT

01:31.197 --> 01:34.533
I'm going to tear the barn to the ground.

01:35.493 --> 01:40.498
This is going to end, once and for all.

01:58.224 --> 01:59.642
Huh.

02:09.276 --> 02:10.653
Goddamn it!

02:13.823 --> 02:17.076
Now it shall burn.
Burn down the whole damn thing.

02:28.921 --> 02:29.755
Huh.

02:52.236 --> 02:53.070
Come on.

04:33.045 --> 04:36.215
Did you guys know that Norway
is the happiest country on Earth?

04:36.215 --> 04:38.467
Yeah? Doesn't surprise me.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.220
It's like Disneyland for Europe.

04:41.220 --> 04:44.139
Now we've moved to Disneyland. How lucky.

04:44.139 --> 04:47.142
I just wish global warming
would hurry up already.

04:47.142 --> 04:51.730
Don't worry. In a couple of years,
when California's just a scorching desert,

04:51.730 --> 04:54.900
- Norway will be just like Santa Monica.
- Yeah, right.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.151
- Hey.
- Hm?

04:56.151 --> 04:57.569
Is that a moose on a sign?

04:58.153 --> 05:00.072
Oh! So cute!

05:00.072 --> 05:02.324
Have you ever seen
a moose on a sign before?

05:02.908 --> 05:04.576
Come on.

05:04.576 --> 05:06.203
Let's take a photo with it.

05:06.203 --> 05:07.287
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:07.287 --> 05:12.001
Oh, this is gonna make the most amazing
family Christmas photo for this year.

05:12.001 --> 05:13.877
Oh, yeah. Great idea.

05:13.877 --> 05:16.296
Okay, everyone line up behind.

05:17.923 --> 05:19.925
- Get a good angle.
- Okay.

05:21.385 --> 05:22.594
Like that?

05:22.594 --> 05:23.929
Yeah, that's great.

05:23.929 --> 05:26.140
Okay, everyone say "moose."

05:26.140 --> 05:28.767
Moose!

05:31.687 --> 05:33.439
- What is that?
- Huh.

05:38.152 --> 05:38.986
Oh.

05:38.986 --> 05:41.238
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, that's so cute.

05:41.238 --> 05:42.489
Just like in the sign.

05:43.657 --> 05:45.159
- So cute.
- Hi, buddy.

05:45.159 --> 05:46.243
Dad, be careful.

05:46.243 --> 05:51.373
I mean, how often do you get the chance
to say hi to a little guy like you, huh?

05:52.249 --> 05:53.250
Hey, buddy.

05:53.834 --> 05:55.419
You cold out here?

05:55.419 --> 05:58.047
Huh?

06:01.717 --> 06:03.177
Is that your mother?

06:04.261 --> 06:05.721
Run!

06:05.721 --> 06:07.556
It's a killer moose!

06:08.140 --> 06:08.974
Come on!

06:08.974 --> 06:10.184
- Run!
- Quick!

06:10.184 --> 06:12.770
Whoa!

06:15.898 --> 06:18.859
- Start the car, goddamn it!
- The car won't start!

06:20.069 --> 06:21.153
Start the car!

06:21.153 --> 06:23.322
What are you doing?

06:27.076 --> 06:29.411
- Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

06:35.834 --> 06:37.252
- Hey.
- Oh.

06:37.252 --> 06:39.922
Are you okay? Everyone all right?

06:40.672 --> 06:43.342
Uh, I'm still working on my Norwegian.

06:43.342 --> 06:45.219
Oh, you're Americans?

06:45.219 --> 06:46.136
Yeah.

06:46.136 --> 06:48.097
I just gotta tell you,
I love <i>The Kardashians.</i>

06:48.222 --> 06:49.056
Hm?

06:49.765 --> 06:51.683
Okay, so the father moose,

06:51.683 --> 06:55.020
he can be a bit crazy
if you go after his kid, so...

06:55.020 --> 06:56.438
Oh, we weren't going--

06:56.438 --> 07:00.192
In Norway, we learn early
that if you mess with nature,

07:00.192 --> 07:03.862
nature will come back right at you
and punch you in the faces.

07:03.862 --> 07:04.863
So good luck!

07:04.863 --> 07:06.907
- Thank you.
- Mm. Thank you. Bye.

07:06.907 --> 07:08.659
Ah, that was fun, huh?

07:08.659 --> 07:10.285
We met the sheriff

07:10.285 --> 07:12.788
and a moose and a baby moose.

07:12.788 --> 07:14.706
Welcome to Norway.

- This is it?

07:50.617 --> 07:51.785
Huh?

07:51.785 --> 07:53.787
Look at that.

07:53.787 --> 07:56.582
I still can't believe
we inherited this place.

07:57.166 --> 07:59.001
It's gonna be
the best Christmas ever, buddy.

07:59.001 --> 08:01.879
Our backyard's bigger
than our whole old neighborhood.

08:04.047 --> 08:07.426
- Yeah, it is.
- We're in the middle of nowhere?

08:09.803 --> 08:10.637
Yeah.

08:11.263 --> 08:13.390
Hey, isn't it great?

08:13.390 --> 08:15.726
- My life is over.
- Come on.

08:15.726 --> 08:17.436
Let's check out our new digs.

08:17.436 --> 08:20.397
Here we are. Home sweet home.

08:21.440 --> 08:22.274
Huh?

08:23.567 --> 08:24.985
Yeah.

08:25.611 --> 08:26.695
- Wow.
- Whoa.

08:26.695 --> 08:28.572
Yeah, whoa, huh?

08:28.572 --> 08:31.867
Ew! It smells like somebody died.

08:32.743 --> 08:35.329
I cannot live here.

08:59.937 --> 09:02.105
It sure is fresh.

09:05.317 --> 09:07.236
- It's exciting.
- Yeah.

09:07.236 --> 09:09.821
This is our future. Bed and breakfast.

09:10.697 --> 09:12.616
- It does need a little work.
- Yeah. Okay.

09:12.616 --> 09:13.992
Not much.

09:15.869 --> 09:16.870
Okay.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.250
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

09:24.795 --> 09:25.754
Wow.

09:28.590 --> 09:29.466
Wow.

09:29.466 --> 09:30.968
Yeah, right?

09:30.968 --> 09:31.969
Wow.

09:31.969 --> 09:36.390
- Needs a bit of work, huh?
- Oh, we'll fix this place up in no time.

09:36.390 --> 09:37.474
And a year from now,

09:37.474 --> 09:40.936
people are gonna be lining up
around the barn to stay here at night.

09:40.936 --> 09:41.937
You'll see.

09:41.937 --> 09:43.146
Yeah?

09:43.146 --> 09:45.107
Yeah, of course.

09:45.107 --> 09:47.317
You could even have
your self-help seminars here.

09:47.317 --> 09:48.235
Yeah.

09:48.235 --> 09:50.153
Just think, your concept of Happy Vision.

09:50.153 --> 09:52.239
Lucas, don't stay out too long.

10:27.149 --> 10:30.861
And that is my great-great-grandfather.

10:30.861 --> 10:32.362
When he was only 18,

10:32.362 --> 10:36.074
he said goodbye to his family
and hopped on a boat to America.

10:37.284 --> 10:40.620
He swore he'd come back, but he never did.

10:43.749 --> 10:45.250
But here you are.

10:47.836 --> 10:49.838
Here we are,

10:49.838 --> 10:52.674
as a family, in our new home.

10:52.674 --> 10:55.552
You know, I just hope
that your kids get used to it.

10:56.136 --> 10:58.638
And that Lucas finally finds a friend.

11:02.642 --> 11:05.729
And us, here together.

11:06.772 --> 11:08.357
Me as their mom.

11:08.357 --> 11:12.569
Hey, you've been their mother for years.
They love you.

11:12.569 --> 11:15.947
I don't know, I just feel like
ever since we got married...

11:17.366 --> 11:19.326
it's like Nora really resents me.

11:19.326 --> 11:20.410
You guys!

11:21.703 --> 11:23.705
There's something in the barn.

11:24.289 --> 11:27.542
- What do you mean, "something"?
- I don't know, but it's something.

11:27.542 --> 11:30.504
Oh, well, it's probably just the wood.

11:30.504 --> 11:33.048
Old buildings, they creak and groan.

11:33.048 --> 11:37.052
Yeah, that's just how
it's gonna be now, living out here.

11:37.052 --> 11:40.639
- Hey, you wanna do something fun tonight?
- Sure.

11:40.639 --> 11:44.142
Should we do what all Norwegians do
this time of year?

11:45.060 --> 11:45.936
Yeah.

11:45.936 --> 11:49.231
For thousands of years,

11:49.231 --> 11:53.944
Norwegians have come out
on winter evenings

11:54.653 --> 11:58.115
to marvel at the sight
of the great Northern Lights.

12:01.159 --> 12:02.828
I can't see shit.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.663
Language.

12:04.663 --> 12:07.124
I'm cold. Can we go inside?

12:07.124 --> 12:09.251
Okay, while we wait
for the sky to clear up,

12:09.251 --> 12:11.169
why don't we have more
of that piping hot glögg?

12:11.169 --> 12:12.421
That'll warm you up, huh?

12:16.216 --> 12:17.884
Maybe we should call it a night.

12:17.884 --> 12:18.969
No, no.

12:19.511 --> 12:21.638
- You guys want to go to bed?
- Yeah.

12:21.638 --> 12:23.974
You're gonna miss the Northern Lights.

12:23.974 --> 12:26.393
- Okay.
- Whatever.

12:30.605 --> 12:35.944
Hey, you know, maybe you should
give them a bit of space.

12:35.944 --> 12:38.947
This is a big change.

12:40.073 --> 12:41.283
For all of us.

13:15.525 --> 13:17.486
Look at this, huh?

13:17.486 --> 13:19.488
We got everything we need here.

13:19.488 --> 13:22.324
A ski shop, bakery.

13:23.158 --> 13:25.035
Another ski shop.

13:25.035 --> 13:26.119
Wonderful.

13:26.912 --> 13:27.913
So great.

13:27.913 --> 13:29.789
Oh! Watch out.

13:29.789 --> 13:31.958
- Oh!
- That looks fun, huh?

13:35.504 --> 13:38.298
Can we go inside? It's fucking freezing.

13:38.298 --> 13:40.634
Hey, don't use the F word.

13:40.634 --> 13:42.928
You're right. I'm sorry.

13:44.054 --> 13:45.722
It's fucking cold.

13:45.722 --> 13:48.141
Oh-- She's not wrong,
I mean, it is cold.

13:48.141 --> 13:51.811
Why don't we go in here
and grab a little Norwegian treat?

13:51.811 --> 13:54.314
- Hm.
- Don't stay out here long, Lucas.

13:54.314 --> 13:56.525
- [townsfolk chattering
- Hey, how are you doing?

13:58.360 --> 14:00.946
Hi. Hello.

14:01.530 --> 14:03.198
This looks cozy, huh?

14:08.328 --> 14:09.538
Hi.

14:09.538 --> 14:11.206
I love your onesie.

14:12.249 --> 14:13.291
Suits you.

14:14.251 --> 14:16.586
Are you the family
that's taking over the Nordheim farm?

14:16.586 --> 14:19.256
Yeah, that's us. Eric was my uncle.

14:19.256 --> 14:22.592
I inherited the farm after he passed away.

14:22.592 --> 14:24.761
Mm.

14:25.512 --> 14:27.681
Yeah, and now we're moving here.

14:32.310 --> 14:35.605
So these are the happiest people on Earth.

14:58.670 --> 14:59.546
Ugh.

15:04.009 --> 15:05.760
That is a barn elf.

15:07.512 --> 15:08.346
What?

15:08.346 --> 15:10.765
That is a barn elf.

15:12.142 --> 15:13.435
I'm American.

15:13.435 --> 15:15.145
Oh, sorry.

15:15.145 --> 15:17.981
Uh, that's, uh, a <i>fjøsnisse.</i>

15:17.981 --> 15:20.984
I guess you can call it a barn elf.

15:21.610 --> 15:22.527
Are they real?

15:23.695 --> 15:24.946
Uh, what do you mean?

15:25.447 --> 15:28.033
Like, do they exist?

15:29.951 --> 15:31.036
Yes.

15:32.787 --> 15:34.205
Are they good or bad?

15:34.205 --> 15:36.499
Uh, if you treat the barn elf nice,

15:36.499 --> 15:39.669
he will be good to you
and help look after the farm.

15:39.669 --> 15:41.421
But if you make him angry,

15:41.421 --> 15:45.675
he will do whatever it takes
to get rid of you.

15:45.675 --> 15:47.302
I've read tales, actually,

15:47.302 --> 15:50.555
about the barn elf
breaking the necks on the cows,

15:50.555 --> 15:54.476
and just shoving their carcasses
into milk containers.

15:55.143 --> 15:56.353
Um...

15:56.353 --> 15:59.356
You know that old dilapidated barn?

15:59.356 --> 16:02.025
We're turning it into a hotel.

16:02.567 --> 16:05.945
It's a little bit rough,
but, uh, you get the idea.

16:08.073 --> 16:12.327
Get back to nature
with Nordheim Forest Glade.

16:12.327 --> 16:14.454
- Our barn is your home.
- Mm-hm!

16:14.454 --> 16:15.580
Briefly.

16:15.580 --> 16:17.082
- Eco-friendly.
- Hm.

16:17.082 --> 16:21.670
Have you ever heard of Airbnb?
Or Vrbo? Uh, HomeAway?

16:22.212 --> 16:23.797
- He's digesting it.
- Yeah.

16:23.797 --> 16:25.507
- It takes a second.
- Uh-huh.

16:25.507 --> 16:26.925
<i>How do you make him angry?</i>

16:27.509 --> 16:29.177
Well, it depends.

16:29.177 --> 16:34.057
Uh, first off, the barn elf is very,
very old-fashioned and traditional,

16:34.057 --> 16:37.102
- so he hates changes to the farm.
- Okay.

16:37.102 --> 16:42.440
Secondly, he doesn't like bright,
artificial light, you know,

16:42.440 --> 16:44.317
and he hates loud noises.

16:44.317 --> 16:47.487
So don't take him to a rave party,
to put it that way.

16:47.487 --> 16:48.405
Okay.

16:48.947 --> 16:49.864
Lucas?

16:50.448 --> 16:53.493
Oh, Lucas, get away from that man.

16:53.493 --> 16:54.869
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi.

16:54.869 --> 16:56.663
I hope he hasn't been bothering you.

16:56.663 --> 16:58.540
No, no, no. He's not bothering me.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.668
I'm just surprised to see a visitor here.

17:01.668 --> 17:03.294
Or a visitor at all.

17:03.294 --> 17:06.881
We don't get any visitors here at all.

17:07.465 --> 17:08.633
It's very cozy.

17:08.633 --> 17:11.469
Yes. I guess you are here on the vacation?

17:11.469 --> 17:13.638
Oh! Oh, no, no, no.

17:13.638 --> 17:15.682
- We actually just moved here.
- Oh.

17:15.682 --> 17:18.977
To the, um-- You know the Nordheim farm?

17:18.977 --> 17:20.770
You know it?

17:20.770 --> 17:23.231
- To the Nordheim farm?
- Yeah.

17:23.815 --> 17:26.276
Yeah, yes. Yes, I know it. Yes.

17:27.318 --> 17:28.361
Bye.

17:28.361 --> 17:29.946
Okay, honey, let's go.

17:50.884 --> 17:51.968
Hello?

18:22.540 --> 18:23.583
Hello?

18:38.932 --> 18:41.434
Oh, right. Sorry.

18:56.699 --> 18:57.951
Don't be afraid.

19:12.674 --> 19:13.591
Hm.

19:16.094 --> 19:16.928
Hm.

19:18.847 --> 19:20.056
You want a cookie?

19:21.766 --> 19:22.851
Hm!

19:25.103 --> 19:28.481
Mm-mm.

19:35.738 --> 19:36.781
Hm! Mm.

19:48.710 --> 19:50.336
You really like that, don't you?

19:55.300 --> 19:56.676
My name's Lucas.

19:57.552 --> 20:00.221
And those other people, they're my family.

20:00.221 --> 20:02.849
And we all promise to keep you safe.

20:04.976 --> 20:06.060
I promise.

20:12.901 --> 20:13.735
Oh.

20:14.277 --> 20:15.194
Oh. Oh.

20:17.739 --> 20:18.865
Want another one?

20:20.450 --> 20:21.284
Hm!

20:31.961 --> 20:33.671
<i>Are there any beaches?</i>

20:34.172 --> 20:36.382
No.

20:36.382 --> 20:38.426
<i>Do they play softball?</i>

20:40.178 --> 20:41.346
No.

20:42.138 --> 20:43.973
<i>So, what is there?</i>

20:43.973 --> 20:46.476
Just snow.

20:49.312 --> 20:50.688
I miss you.

20:51.272 --> 20:52.857
This really sucks.

20:57.695 --> 20:58.696
Jess?

21:01.074 --> 21:02.116
Jess!

21:08.247 --> 21:10.750
- Heard of knocking?
- Sorry.

21:15.463 --> 21:18.007
I know you're going
through a tough time right now,

21:18.007 --> 21:20.134
but you know what can really help?

21:20.134 --> 21:23.513
It's something
I like to call Happy Vision.

21:23.513 --> 21:24.597
Oh, my God.

21:24.597 --> 21:27.517
Are you seriously doing
your life-coaching on me right now?

21:28.601 --> 21:30.687
My tools have helped a lot of people.

21:31.396 --> 21:34.607
If you envision something
that makes you really happy,

21:34.607 --> 21:35.817
it can come true.

21:35.817 --> 21:38.444
My friends are my life.

21:39.237 --> 21:42.824
How am I supposed
to visualize them into existence, huh?

21:47.704 --> 21:50.248
Norway will grow on you.

21:51.290 --> 21:55.378
The only thing
that'll grow on me here is icicles.

21:56.671 --> 21:57.797
Good talk.

22:06.180 --> 22:08.349
<i>It's nice to meet you.</i>

22:08.349 --> 22:10.977
It's nice to milk you.

22:10.977 --> 22:12.437
<i>One more time.</i>

22:12.437 --> 22:13.563
Okay.

22:13.563 --> 22:15.648
<i>It's nice to meet you.</i>

22:15.648 --> 22:17.859
It's nice to milk you.

22:17.859 --> 22:19.527
- Morning.
- Good morning.

22:19.527 --> 22:21.779
How is the Norwegian coming along?

22:21.779 --> 22:24.282
Uh, great.
You know, I'm practically fluent.

22:24.282 --> 22:25.366
Sounding great.

22:25.366 --> 22:28.369
- Yeah, I'm picking it up pretty easy.
- Amazing.

22:28.369 --> 22:32.582
You know, I really hope Nora
and Lucas make some new friends.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.168
They must miss their old friends a lot.

22:35.168 --> 22:37.336
I'm sure they'll make friends in no time.

22:38.087 --> 22:39.589
Mm. I don't know.

22:40.465 --> 22:43.176
I feel like these Norwegians
are really hard to connect with.

22:43.176 --> 22:44.510
My grandpa used to say:

22:44.510 --> 22:47.638
"Norwegians have an ice wall
around their hearts.

22:47.638 --> 22:51.684
But if you can manage to melt it,
you have a friend for life."

22:51.684 --> 22:52.602
Hm.

22:52.602 --> 22:55.188
<i>♪ To go riding in a one-horse sleigh... ♪</i>

22:55.188 --> 22:58.566
Maybe we could invite the neighbors over.

22:58.566 --> 23:00.276
We could throw a party?

23:00.276 --> 23:01.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

23:01.736 --> 23:03.529
Show them good old American hospitality.

23:03.529 --> 23:05.364
Yeah. That might thaw their frozen hearts.

23:05.364 --> 23:06.908
That's a great idea.

23:08.117 --> 23:10.536
Why don't we throw the party at the barn?

23:11.287 --> 23:12.288
Perfect.

23:15.750 --> 23:16.834
Okay.

23:16.834 --> 23:19.545
I'm gonna clear the snow.
It's not gonna clear itself.

23:27.678 --> 23:30.056
Oh, yeah.

23:42.610 --> 23:43.694
It cleared itself.

23:44.403 --> 23:45.238
Huh?

23:45.238 --> 23:48.658
Ah, well, maybe it's a public service
they provide in Norway.

23:49.742 --> 23:50.618
Right.

23:50.618 --> 23:53.579
And now you see
how social democracy works, Lucas.

23:53.579 --> 23:54.914
- Hm?
- You pay your taxes

23:54.914 --> 23:56.082
and they fix stuff for you.

23:56.082 --> 23:57.542
Gotta love Norway.

24:41.502 --> 24:43.254
Thanks for clearing the snow.

24:43.754 --> 24:45.298
That was very kind of you.

24:49.802 --> 24:50.636
Oh.

25:02.648 --> 25:03.608
Mmm!

25:07.069 --> 25:07.987
Thank you.

25:17.413 --> 25:18.831
Who are you talking to?

25:20.208 --> 25:21.250

25:21.250 --> 25:23.502
- He was here.
- Right.

25:23.502 --> 25:24.921

No, no, illegally cutting down
your own tree

- No, stop it.

27:21.746 --> 27:24.248
He hates bright lights.

27:24.248 --> 27:26.709
- Who?
- The barn elf.

27:26.709 --> 27:28.711
The barn elf?

27:28.711 --> 27:32.631
Oh, it was part of that exhibition
at the museum.

27:32.631 --> 27:35.468
Yeah, he's real. And he lives right there.

27:36.469 --> 27:39.138
And if we treat him well,
he'll treat us well.

27:39.138 --> 27:41.182
And he hates this stuff.

27:41.182 --> 27:43.934
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
He hates decorations?

27:43.934 --> 27:48.189
No, he hates lights, he hates changes,
he hates loud noises.

29:51.896 --> 29:54.482
So, what do you think happened, officer?

29:54.482 --> 29:56.275
Probably some kids, you know?

29:56.275 --> 29:58.986
The youth club closed, so they're bored.

29:58.986 --> 29:59.904
Hm.

- Yeah.

30:16.212 --> 30:17.338
Oh, yeah.

30:17.838 --> 30:20.090
I'm going
to swipe this area for fingerprints,

30:20.090 --> 30:22.843
and then I'll call the forensics,
and, uh...

30:24.512 --> 30:27.932
Oh, I'm just kidding.
I will look into it though.

30:27.932 --> 30:29.225

- Hey.

30:29.225 --> 30:31.185

You just let her go.

30:45.282 --> 30:46.575

- Why?

30:47.618 --> 30:49.995
She said she's gonna handle it.
She's gonna look into it.

30:49.995 --> 30:52.164
- That means "do nothing."
- No.

30:52.873 --> 30:56.085

You remember four years ago,
when I met you at your seminar?

31:28.075 --> 31:32.329
I was really struggling.
I was at the end of my rope.

31:32.329 --> 31:36.000
You gave me the tools to deal
with the most difficult time in my life.

31:36.000 --> 31:39.169

- No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

I must've dislodged it
when I was moving boxes.

32:00.608 --> 32:03.402
We gotta go.
The guests will be here in five hours,

32:03.402 --> 32:05.321

if you have a concussion.

32:05.321 --> 32:06.488
Okay.

32:12.119 --> 32:13.537

32:13.537 --> 32:15.372

35:01.288 --> 35:02.664
We do that too.

35:02.664 --> 35:04.958
- You want some?
- Sure.

35:05.959 --> 35:09.379
- This, I brew myself.
- Oh. Right.

35:09.379 --> 35:12.049
Don't go near an open flame
after you drink this stuff,

35:12.049 --> 35:12.966
I tell you that.

35:13.842 --> 35:15.886
- Maybe I don't drink it.
- You drink it.

35:15.886 --> 35:21.183
And so I pictured this happy life
in Norway, and here we are.

35:21.183 --> 35:23.393
- And we'll make it happen.
- Yeah.

35:23.393 --> 35:25.354
- Eventually.
- You are so brave.

35:25.354 --> 35:26.605
Thank you.

35:26.605 --> 35:29.274
I've always wanted to be an American.

35:29.274 --> 35:30.984
- I have a question.
- Yeah.

35:30.984 --> 35:34.321
- Have you ever been chased by the cops?
- No.

35:34.321 --> 35:39.076
You know, like a car chase or a foot chase
or, like, an escalator. Whatever.

35:39.076 --> 35:41.286
Why did you move to Norway?

35:41.286 --> 35:42.371
I don't know.

35:44.331 --> 35:48.418
I guess my dad just thought, um,
that if we moved somewhere else,

35:48.418 --> 35:52.214
we would just magically become
this big, happy family.

35:52.965 --> 35:55.843
- I have to admit, it hasn't been easy.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

35:55.843 --> 35:58.720
And all the rumors and everything.

35:59.471 --> 36:00.305
Rumors?

36:00.889 --> 36:02.391
About the farm.

36:02.391 --> 36:03.851
That it's haunted.

36:05.185 --> 36:06.353
Very terrible.

36:16.613 --> 36:17.781
Hi.

36:21.034 --> 36:22.536
Can you give us a minute?

36:23.662 --> 36:25.163
- Okay.
- Thank you.

36:25.163 --> 36:26.582
See you later.

36:28.709 --> 36:29.710
Is that wine?

36:30.210 --> 36:31.962
- Mm-- Mm-mm.
- Oh.

36:36.758 --> 36:39.261
I know what you're going through.

36:39.261 --> 36:43.724
You know, moving can be so hard.

36:47.352 --> 36:51.690
Raymond, can I ask a huge favor?

36:52.816 --> 36:55.819
You want me to be Santa
on Christmas Eve, right?

36:55.819 --> 36:57.070
Yeah.

36:57.070 --> 36:58.405
Yes!

36:58.405 --> 37:00.949
I love being Santa on Christmas Eve.

37:02.451 --> 37:03.285
Great.

37:03.285 --> 37:07.331
I'm usually alone on Christmas anyway,
so I have nothing else to do.

37:07.331 --> 37:10.834
I mean, how do you even
make friends at my age?

37:10.834 --> 37:12.586
You are so lucky.

37:13.378 --> 37:18.258
It's so much easier when you're young
and gravity hasn't taken over.

37:21.178 --> 37:22.304
Are you okay?

37:23.889 --> 37:24.723
Ugh.

37:28.727 --> 37:30.103
The party's over!

37:32.230 --> 37:34.441
Please stop.

37:34.441 --> 37:35.943
You're making the elf mad.

37:35.943 --> 37:37.194
Lucas.

37:37.194 --> 37:38.612
Quiet, everyone!

37:40.489 --> 37:41.740
Are you kidding me?

37:43.116 --> 37:44.785
I can't believe this.

37:44.785 --> 37:47.037
I mean, you're not even 21.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.000
What?

37:54.252 --> 37:55.379
You're grounded.

37:57.089 --> 37:58.715
I'm already grounded!

37:58.715 --> 38:01.426
We're all fucking grounded anyway!

38:02.135 --> 38:05.514
Well, then your phone is confiscated.

38:06.515 --> 38:07.808
Until January.

38:09.476 --> 38:10.811
You're a monster.

38:14.940 --> 38:15.983
What?

38:15.983 --> 38:18.860
- She's your daughter.
- Yeah?

38:18.860 --> 38:21.113
Why don't you say something?

38:21.113 --> 38:22.322
Yeah.

38:22.322 --> 38:26.952
I agree with Carol, your mother. Stepmother.

38:32.082 --> 38:33.917
Hey. Um...

38:37.087 --> 38:41.425
You know, Lucas,
the things I told you about at the museum,

38:41.425 --> 38:43.301
about the barn elves...

38:43.301 --> 38:45.554
You see, barn elves,

38:46.304 --> 38:48.015
they aren't actually--

38:48.015 --> 38:51.685
They're making the elf mad,
and no one will listen to me.

38:52.269 --> 38:53.562
You have to help me.

38:58.108 --> 39:01.653
Well, if it's like you say, Lucas,

39:01.653 --> 39:05.407
then there's only one thing you can do.

39:05.407 --> 39:07.826
- What's that?
- On Christmas Eve,

39:07.826 --> 39:11.955
you must place a bowl of porridge
in the barn.

39:13.040 --> 39:14.374
Porridge?

39:15.250 --> 39:16.585
Yes, it's a food.

39:17.502 --> 39:20.047
Porridge.
You make it out of different grains.

39:20.047 --> 39:22.549
Oat, wheat, corn, rice.

39:22.549 --> 39:25.093
And you cook it in milk and water. Porridge.

39:25.093 --> 39:27.304
I'm surprised
you don't know what porridge is.

39:27.304 --> 39:30.182
- I know what porridge is.
- Yeah, now you do.

39:30.182 --> 39:31.641
Because I explained it to you.

39:31.641 --> 39:34.603
Anyway, so on Christmas Eve,

39:34.603 --> 39:37.481
you make a bowl of rice porridge.

39:37.481 --> 39:38.565
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:38.565 --> 39:42.861
And you put cinnamon on top of it
and a bit of butter in the middle.

39:42.861 --> 39:45.280
- Mm-hm.
- And you place it out in the barn.

39:45.280 --> 39:48.033
- Okay.
- Okay? You see, this is an ancient ritual.

39:48.033 --> 39:52.621
A sacred peace offering
between humans and elves.

39:52.621 --> 39:55.207
- Would this make the elf happy?
- Absolutely.

39:55.207 --> 39:58.627
As long as the elf gets his porridge,
all will be well.

40:00.587 --> 40:02.005
- Okay.
- Good.

40:02.005 --> 40:05.300
And now you also know what porridge is.
That's a bonus.

40:37.332 --> 40:38.333
Call the police.

40:39.751 --> 40:41.253
Okay. Be careful.

40:41.253 --> 40:42.337
Uh-huh.

41:13.076 --> 41:14.536
What the heck?

41:22.002 --> 41:23.795
Huh?

41:53.283 --> 41:54.784
Ow!

41:58.330 --> 41:59.164
Bill?

42:01.958 --> 42:03.001
Bill.

42:33.531 --> 42:34.532
Okay.

42:35.242 --> 42:37.911
Okay. Okay.

42:58.556 --> 42:59.641
Hello?

43:04.145 --> 43:05.105
Huh?

43:06.064 --> 43:08.108
Mom?

43:08.650 --> 43:10.944
Oh, my God.

43:17.701 --> 43:20.912
Wow. That's some party you've had here...

43:21.496 --> 43:24.499
that would be nice
to have been invited to.

43:24.499 --> 43:25.917
I'm just kidding.

43:25.917 --> 43:31.047
But it's, uh, easy to go a bit overboard
with the alcohol during Christmas times.

43:31.047 --> 43:33.842
- I've been there. We've all been there.
- Sure.

43:33.842 --> 43:34.801
We're sober.

43:34.801 --> 43:36.177
Mm-hm.

43:36.177 --> 43:38.513
Are you actually gonna do
some police work this time?

43:40.849 --> 43:43.560
You know, it could be a fox.

43:44.394 --> 43:46.062
- A fox?
- Yes.

43:46.062 --> 43:49.983
If the window was open
and you had a lot of food around,

43:49.983 --> 43:52.193
- it could be.
- In the house?

43:52.193 --> 43:55.071
You have Fox News, don't you?

43:55.071 --> 43:58.199
Or it could have been the ghost.

43:58.199 --> 44:00.327
Oh, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't be joking about that.

44:00.327 --> 44:01.453
- Yes.
- I'm so sorry.

44:01.453 --> 44:04.039
Thank you for your time.
We'll keep all the windows closed.

44:04.039 --> 44:06.916
Do that, okay?
And have a peaceful Christmas.

44:06.916 --> 44:09.919
Go easy on the booze
because of the kids and... Yeah.

44:09.919 --> 44:11.796
You know, all that.

44:11.796 --> 44:15.091
- Absolutely. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

44:15.091 --> 44:17.969
- And don't drink and drive!
- Okay.

44:17.969 --> 44:19.554
Thank you.

44:19.554 --> 44:23.683
A fox, huh? That puts my mind at rest.
How about you?

44:33.109 --> 44:35.528
- Bill?
- Yeah?

44:37.405 --> 44:39.824
Why do people think the barn is haunted?

44:44.829 --> 44:45.997
Lutefisk.

44:49.125 --> 44:52.087
You told me your uncle died after a fall.

44:52.670 --> 44:53.797
Is that true?

44:58.802 --> 45:00.136
Yeah. Yes.

45:01.554 --> 45:02.680
What happened?

45:03.473 --> 45:05.725
Okay.

45:06.810 --> 45:07.811
Okay.

45:09.437 --> 45:11.314
According to the police report,

45:11.314 --> 45:14.567
- Mm-hm.
- he was on the second floor of the barn,

45:14.567 --> 45:17.112
- Mm-hm.
- and he fell out of a window.

45:18.863 --> 45:24.536
And accidentally caught himself on fire.

45:25.120 --> 45:26.121
What?

45:26.663 --> 45:30.125
He was trying to burn the barn down,
they think.

45:31.251 --> 45:33.670
Why would he want
to burn down the barn?

45:33.670 --> 45:34.963
I don't know.

45:34.963 --> 45:37.006
He was old and senile.

45:37.006 --> 45:39.175
They don't have therapy here.

45:39.175 --> 45:40.844
Why didn't you tell me?

45:41.469 --> 45:43.930
I was a little worried
about how you'd react.

45:43.930 --> 45:48.017
Look, it's nothing to get worked up over.
It was just a bizarre accident.

45:48.017 --> 45:52.272
All I know is that it's been one thing
after another ever since we got here.

45:52.272 --> 45:56.401
You can't be saying
that you think my uncle is haunting us?

45:56.401 --> 45:59.487
- We should never have come here.
- Calm down.

45:59.487 --> 46:02.157
- Don't get worked up over nothing.
- Nothing?

46:03.658 --> 46:06.327
I gave up everything to be here.

46:07.120 --> 46:09.289
My friends, my career.

46:09.289 --> 46:11.916
I am worried about the children, Bill.

46:11.916 --> 46:14.252
Hey, they're fine.

46:14.252 --> 46:17.297
I know they'll adapt.

46:18.256 --> 46:19.382
I'm their father.

46:20.383 --> 46:24.220
Right. And I'm just the evil stepmom.

46:25.972 --> 46:28.516
That's not-- Those aren't my words.

46:28.516 --> 46:30.477
I didn't mean it that way.

46:32.270 --> 46:33.271
Carol.

47:02.634 --> 47:05.678
Ugh. What is that smell?

47:06.471 --> 47:07.931
Dinner is served.

47:07.931 --> 47:11.142
Here we are. For you, ladies.

47:11.142 --> 47:12.644
Uh...

47:12.644 --> 47:14.812
- Okay.
- What the fuck is that?

47:14.812 --> 47:15.897
Language.

47:15.897 --> 47:18.983
It is lutefisk.

47:18.983 --> 47:22.612
It is a traditional
Norwegian holiday dish.

47:22.612 --> 47:26.115
It's stockfish aged in lye for many days.

47:26.115 --> 47:31.538
That's why the odor is so delicious
and abundant. Hm?

47:32.372 --> 47:33.831
Old fish Jell-O?

47:33.831 --> 47:36.376
No. I mean...

47:36.376 --> 47:38.920
Uh, no, I'm not touching that.
That's not...

47:39.504 --> 47:40.547
Not happening.

47:42.090 --> 47:44.759
It's okay. We can enjoy it without her.

47:50.932 --> 47:52.141
It's okay.

47:55.311 --> 47:57.855
- Don't read at the table.
- Or what?

47:57.855 --> 48:01.150
What more could you possibly do
to punish me?

48:02.777 --> 48:04.320
It's okay.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.697
Everybody dig in.

48:05.697 --> 48:07.824
Hm? Give it a try.

48:08.575 --> 48:10.243
You don't know till you try.

48:10.243 --> 48:11.160
Hm?

48:16.916 --> 48:18.084
What's that...?

48:23.214 --> 48:25.675
Good, huh, buddy?

48:32.640 --> 48:33.725
Ooh.

48:33.725 --> 48:36.978
Boy, just living the Norwegian dream, huh?

48:38.271 --> 48:39.606
This is not a dream.

48:40.523 --> 48:42.942
This is hell, frozen over.

48:42.942 --> 48:44.986
Okay, not in front of the kids.

48:44.986 --> 48:46.070
Aw.

48:47.322 --> 48:49.198
What happened to Happy Vision?

48:50.158 --> 48:51.534
Yeah, Happy--

48:51.534 --> 48:55.622
She still has Happy Vision.
Happy Vision is for everyone. We all...

48:55.622 --> 48:58.041
Fuck Happy Vision!

49:07.550 --> 49:12.263
Fuck Happy Vision. Fuck this stupid house.
Fuck this stupid country. Fuck it all!

49:18.269 --> 49:20.730
Mm-hm! Hm.

49:35.370 --> 49:36.621
Mmm.

49:38.581 --> 49:41.459
Mmm. Mmm.

49:43.211 --> 49:44.671
What are you doing?

49:45.254 --> 49:46.089
Hm?

49:49.592 --> 49:52.220
- I was hungry.
- That was for the barn elf.

49:53.096 --> 49:54.097
Whoops.

49:55.765 --> 49:58.393
Well, he would have loved it.

49:59.394 --> 50:00.645
It was delicious.

50:01.729 --> 50:03.481
That's all the porridge we had.

50:04.816 --> 50:07.485
That was our only chance
at having peace with the elf.

50:10.571 --> 50:13.449
Yes, of course. Yeah. Uh-huh.

50:13.449 --> 50:17.203
Buddy, we'll just have to make peace
with the elf another way.

50:18.204 --> 50:19.205
Okay?

50:27.171 --> 50:28.673
I brought you something.

50:29.716 --> 50:33.886
It isn't exactly porridge,
but it's something special.

50:36.889 --> 50:37.890
It's lutefisk.

50:40.101 --> 50:42.270
It's really, really yummy.

50:42.937 --> 50:43.938
Enjoy.

50:52.363 --> 50:54.198
Hm. Hm...

51:09.255 --> 51:10.506
Hm.

51:42.622 --> 51:45.541
Hyah! Whoa. Oh...

51:54.467 --> 51:55.760
Whoa!

51:56.844 --> 51:58.554
Ow.

52:07.980 --> 52:08.981
Lucas?

52:14.529 --> 52:15.905
Let the show begin.

52:19.200 --> 52:22.286
Ho-ho-ho!

52:24.956 --> 52:26.457
Where are you going?

52:27.083 --> 52:30.878
Don't you want to go inside
and open some presents?

52:31.796 --> 52:33.548
Lucas, don't be afraid.

52:33.548 --> 52:35.132
It's just Santa Claus.

52:35.967 --> 52:37.885
Ho-ho-ho.

52:41.389 --> 52:43.474
Ah! Lucas, there you are.

52:44.517 --> 52:45.768
Come inside.

52:46.894 --> 52:48.521
Oh!

52:48.521 --> 52:52.275
What are you doing?
Let's go inside. It's freezing out here.

52:53.109 --> 52:56.487
Come on, let's go inside
and open some presents.

53:01.158 --> 53:02.702
Oh, my God.

53:05.746 --> 53:07.665
Oh... huh?

53:32.899 --> 53:36.444
Where is he?
Santa should have been here by now.

53:40.573 --> 53:42.366
Just gonna get some fresh air.

53:56.923 --> 53:57.757
Huh.

54:13.689 --> 54:14.690
Raymond?

54:22.031 --> 54:23.032
Raymond?

54:49.183 --> 54:50.309
We have to go.

54:51.352 --> 54:52.770
- Now.
- What happened?

54:53.270 --> 54:54.271
Just get up.

54:55.481 --> 54:57.566
We have to go now. Let's go!

54:57.566 --> 54:59.652
- What happened?
- Get in the car!

54:59.652 --> 55:01.821
- Go, go, go!
- Go! Go!

55:02.697 --> 55:05.032
- Go, go, go! Get in the car!
- Okay!

55:11.956 --> 55:14.250
- Bill, what is going on?
- It's not turning over.

55:14.250 --> 55:16.419
No, what is going on? What's happening?

55:16.419 --> 55:19.130
Raymond. I saw Raymond. He was just there.

55:19.130 --> 55:20.214
- He was...
- Okay.

55:20.214 --> 55:21.966
He was there, and he was--

55:21.966 --> 55:23.342
- Use your words!
- I'm--

55:26.470 --> 55:27.888
What is that?

55:31.642 --> 55:33.394
What? Oh, no.

55:39.942 --> 55:42.069
Drive! Drive! Go!

55:42.862 --> 55:44.905
What the hell is that?!

55:44.905 --> 55:46.032
It's the elf!

55:50.036 --> 55:51.245
Do something!

55:51.245 --> 55:53.289
The car won't turn on!

55:57.418 --> 55:59.170
Turn on the headlights!

55:59.795 --> 56:01.422
- Turn on the lights.
- Yeah.

56:03.507 --> 56:04.675
Run back to the house.

56:04.675 --> 56:06.677
- Go, kids, go.
- As fast as you can.

56:08.679 --> 56:09.764
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

56:10.431 --> 56:12.600
- Okay. We gotta call the cops.
- Yeah.

56:20.649 --> 56:22.610
Lucas was telling the truth.

56:23.194 --> 56:24.445
It's an elf.

56:24.445 --> 56:29.408
Maybe it's a child who ran away from home,
headed to a Nordic death metal festival.

56:30.493 --> 56:32.411
It has a beard, Bill.

56:32.411 --> 56:34.580
This isn't a fully flushed-out theory.

56:54.058 --> 56:56.685
Hm?

57:25.798 --> 57:27.591
Oh, my God.

57:30.845 --> 57:32.012
Oh, my God!

57:33.347 --> 57:35.015
Come on, get up.
We've gotta go now.

57:35.015 --> 57:37.434
- Let's go. Let's go this way.
- We've gotta go. Come on.

58:02.168 --> 58:03.502
Leave us alone!

58:04.128 --> 58:06.964
They don't speak English, honey.
They're Norwegian.

58:11.302 --> 58:12.386
I got it.

58:12.386 --> 58:16.348
Do you want snow shovel up to your ass?

58:17.641 --> 58:19.560
Huh?

58:20.603 --> 58:22.855
Honey, I don't think that worked.

58:22.855 --> 58:23.939
Nope.

58:52.593 --> 58:54.762
Stay away, stay away! Stay back!

59:16.075 --> 59:17.785
You little mother--

59:46.647 --> 59:47.982
Oh, God!

01:00:39.158 --> 01:00:40.534
Help!

01:00:41.618 --> 01:00:42.619
Lucas!

01:00:51.378 --> 01:00:52.921
I'm sorry about the porridge.

01:00:52.921 --> 01:00:54.381
Please don't kill me.

01:01:16.153 --> 01:01:17.404
Please don't kill me.

01:01:22.659 --> 01:01:23.744
You remember this?

01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:28.082
We'll follow the rules, I promise.

01:01:49.353 --> 01:01:50.187
Whoa.

01:01:58.904 --> 01:01:59.905
Let's go!

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:02.491
Nora, Lucas!

01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:14.837
I can't hold them much longer!

01:02:14.837 --> 01:02:16.296
Keep them out!

01:02:21.802 --> 01:02:23.637
No, no, no!

01:02:37.734 --> 01:02:39.111
Get back!

01:02:53.041 --> 01:02:55.335
- Calm down.
- I'm so glad you're here.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.380
- Oh, yeah. Thank you.
- It's okay.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:01.967
If you could calm down
a little bit now, just...

01:03:01.967 --> 01:03:03.677
Okay, let's all calm down.

01:03:03.677 --> 01:03:04.595
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:03:04.595 --> 01:03:07.389
- What's going on here?
- We are under attack.

01:03:07.931 --> 01:03:11.018
- You have to call for backup right now.
- Okay.

01:03:11.768 --> 01:03:15.147
Uh, the nearest police station
is quite a bit far away.

01:03:15.147 --> 01:03:17.274
It's like two hours.
Maybe more now in this weather.

01:03:17.274 --> 01:03:18.901
- But who's attacking you?
- Elves.

01:03:18.901 --> 01:03:22.446
Little elves with big, long beards
and pointy red hats.

01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:23.739
<i>- Nisser?</i>
- Very angry.

01:03:23.739 --> 01:03:26.074
- You're talking about <i>nisser?
- Nisser?</i>

01:03:26.658 --> 01:03:29.620
- Oh, yes, yes. The <i>nisser,</i> yes, yes!
- Oh, okay.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.371
- Yeah, exactly. Angry.
- Yeah.

01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:32.664
- Very angry.
- Kids?

01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:35.250
- Okay, listen to me, okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:35.250 --> 01:03:39.505
<i>Nisser</i> doesn't exist.
They're only in fairy tales, okay?

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:41.673
- So you can just relax.
- What? They were here!

01:03:41.673 --> 01:03:44.384
I mean, it's a good prank, okay?

01:03:44.384 --> 01:03:46.470
- But you're drunk--
- Where's your gun?

01:03:47.012 --> 01:03:49.097
I don't have a gun.

01:03:49.097 --> 01:03:50.641
- What?
- What?!

01:03:50.641 --> 01:03:52.309
This is not America, okay?

01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:56.730
We don't run around, shoot people
in their faces and knees all the time.

01:03:56.730 --> 01:03:58.899
- You're not armed?
- I'm armed.

01:03:58.899 --> 01:04:02.319
Yes, I have a gun at the scooter.

01:04:02.319 --> 01:04:04.279
- Go get it. Go get it.
- Yeah. Now.

01:04:04.279 --> 01:04:08.158
Calm down, you crazy Americans.
It's Christmas Eve.

01:04:08.158 --> 01:04:11.954
I have a pork belly in the oven,
and I'm watching <i>Love Actually.</i>

01:04:11.954 --> 01:04:16.041
I'm at the point where the guy
is outside with the signs, you know?

01:04:16.041 --> 01:04:19.836
And I love that part,
so I just wanna go home now.

01:04:20.921 --> 01:04:23.048
But what the heck?

01:04:47.155 --> 01:04:49.074
Hey! Get off!

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.076
Hey, stop!

01:04:51.702 --> 01:04:53.704
No, no, no!

01:04:53.704 --> 01:04:55.706
Stop! No!

01:05:13.181 --> 01:05:15.642
- Let's go. Come on, kids!
- Go, go, go! Get in.

01:05:59.645 --> 01:06:00.479
Huh?

01:06:02.898 --> 01:06:04.941
Ah...

01:06:18.246 --> 01:06:19.247
Oh, God.

01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.041
Oh, no.

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:23.126
- Is this all right?
- Oh, God.

01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:25.962
- Lucas, come here, son.
- Yes.

01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:30.509
- I need you to do something for me, okay?
- Okay.

01:06:30.509 --> 01:06:32.135
I was bitten.

01:06:32.135 --> 01:06:34.429
So when I start to change,

01:06:34.971 --> 01:06:36.556
you have to kill me.

01:06:36.556 --> 01:06:39.810
- What?
- You're almost a man now. You can do this.

01:06:39.810 --> 01:06:42.104
Oh, no, no, no.
My phone's out of battery.

01:06:42.104 --> 01:06:44.398
- You have to kill me.
- Bill?

01:06:44.398 --> 01:06:46.358
- I can't become one of them.
- Bill.

01:06:46.358 --> 01:06:48.527
They're not zombies.
That's not how it works.

01:06:48.527 --> 01:06:50.362
You won't turn into one of them.

01:06:50.362 --> 01:06:51.697
- Bill!
- Huh?

01:06:51.697 --> 01:06:53.156
Where's your phone?

01:06:54.032 --> 01:06:55.409
It's charging downstairs.

01:06:55.409 --> 01:06:56.743
What about yours?

01:06:57.869 --> 01:07:00.664
You guys took it, remember?

01:08:22.913 --> 01:08:24.998
What are they doing down there?

01:08:24.998 --> 01:08:28.210
I don't know,
but it sounds like they're having a ball.

01:08:33.507 --> 01:08:34.758
I'm so sorry.

01:08:37.135 --> 01:08:38.512
This is all my fault.

01:08:42.974 --> 01:08:45.227
After your mom died...

01:08:46.937 --> 01:08:48.230
all that you went through...

01:08:49.272 --> 01:08:52.943
I promised myself I would never let
anything bad happen to you again.

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:57.697
And I thought moving here was the answer.

01:08:59.407 --> 01:09:00.617
But I was wrong.

01:09:01.827 --> 01:09:03.703
Oh, God, I was wrong.

01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:09.125
- It's okay, Dad.
- Yeah, it is okay.

01:09:09.125 --> 01:09:10.919
It's not okay. I screw up!

01:09:11.878 --> 01:09:13.547
I screw up, that's what I do.

01:09:18.093 --> 01:09:21.388
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming ♪</i>

01:09:21.388 --> 01:09:23.682
<i>♪ Santa Claus is coming... ♪</i>

01:09:41.408 --> 01:09:44.119
You know, it's not that bad.

01:09:45.996 --> 01:09:48.957
I mean, we've had worse Christmases.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.377
Okay, the first Christmas?

01:09:53.169 --> 01:09:54.838
When we got stuck at JFK?

01:09:55.589 --> 01:09:58.049
Yeah, and we ate McDonald's
and got food poisoning.

01:09:58.049 --> 01:09:59.426
Exactly.

01:09:59.426 --> 01:10:01.469
We took over the lavatory.

01:10:01.469 --> 01:10:04.055
We just kept swapping out,
each one of us going in.

01:10:04.055 --> 01:10:06.850
No one else in the whole airplane
got to use the bathroom.

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.519
Yeah. And you threw up in my hair.

01:10:09.519 --> 01:10:11.646
- Twice.
- Yeah.

01:10:11.646 --> 01:10:13.648
What about last Christmas,

01:10:13.648 --> 01:10:17.068
when Grandma brought
her new lover, Stefan?

01:10:17.068 --> 01:10:19.237
- Oh, God.
- Stefan.

01:10:19.237 --> 01:10:21.698
They could not keep
their hands off each other, huh?

01:10:21.698 --> 01:10:24.576
- At least you guys didn't walk in on them.
- Yes, I did.

01:10:25.619 --> 01:10:27.078
Oh, no. You walked in on them too?

01:10:27.078 --> 01:10:29.289
Yeah, twice.

01:10:34.753 --> 01:10:36.755
<i>♪ Come take me away ♪</i>

01:10:54.439 --> 01:10:56.733
Okay, we have to get help.

01:10:56.733 --> 01:10:59.235
The guy at the museum lives
on the other side of the road.

01:11:00.612 --> 01:11:03.031
You know,
I don't know if I can go anywhere.

01:11:03.031 --> 01:11:05.492
Well, Raymond's kick-sled is out front.

01:11:05.492 --> 01:11:08.411
I think it's all downhill from here.
I can make it.

01:11:08.411 --> 01:11:11.039
- I'll come with you.
- Okay.

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:12.123
Let's go, Dad.

01:11:14.084 --> 01:11:15.168
- Be careful.
- Okay.

01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.673
- Good luck.
- Okay.

01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:22.258
Whoa!

01:11:22.258 --> 01:11:23.969
Ow.

01:11:25.887 --> 01:11:26.888
Ow.

01:11:48.576 --> 01:11:49.411
Go, go, go.

01:11:50.286 --> 01:11:51.287
Go.

01:11:54.624 --> 01:11:56.251
They saw us. Let's go!

01:11:56.251 --> 01:11:58.420
- Dad, faster!
- Go, go, go!

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:03.717
Come on, Dad. Faster!

01:12:03.717 --> 01:12:06.344
- Run, run, run! Faster!
- Go, Dad! Go!

01:12:11.224 --> 01:12:14.936
Okay, we need to be prepared
in case they come for us.

01:12:14.936 --> 01:12:16.146
Any ideas?

01:12:16.855 --> 01:12:18.189
Fire seemed pretty effective.

01:12:18.189 --> 01:12:20.108
Do you have anything flammable
in your room?

01:12:21.443 --> 01:12:24.738
I might have a bottle of moonshine.

01:12:26.072 --> 01:12:29.576
We need to have a talk
about that later. But perfect.

01:12:57.479 --> 01:12:58.938
They have saw blades?

01:13:03.068 --> 01:13:04.819
Oh!

01:13:09.032 --> 01:13:10.033
Here they come.

01:13:27.383 --> 01:13:28.551
Pick up the pace!

01:13:46.861 --> 01:13:48.655
- I think we lost them.
- Yeah.

01:13:49.989 --> 01:13:51.366
- There you go.
- Okay.

01:13:52.617 --> 01:13:53.743
Hm?

01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:22.230
Shit.

01:14:40.039 --> 01:14:42.709
- Hey, these things are pretty fun.
- Yeah.

01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:45.211
Yeah!

01:14:50.341 --> 01:14:53.094
Oh, no, no, no!
We definitely didn't lose them.

01:14:55.346 --> 01:14:56.723
Oh, God, you're right.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.685
Brake, brake! Brake!

01:15:00.685 --> 01:15:02.145
It's back for revenge!

01:15:26.961 --> 01:15:28.838
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:30.006 --> 01:15:32.133
- Is that a house?
- I think so.

01:15:33.301 --> 01:15:34.135
Come on.

01:15:40.099 --> 01:15:41.392
I'm so sorry.

01:15:43.186 --> 01:15:44.312
For what?

01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:46.856
I know you've never accepted me
as your mother.

01:15:47.941 --> 01:15:49.442
And that you hate me.

01:15:49.442 --> 01:15:51.819
And that's okay. I just...

01:15:51.819 --> 01:15:53.655
You know, I just wish...

01:15:55.114 --> 01:15:57.492
Carol, I don't hate you.

01:15:58.409 --> 01:15:59.786
I'm 16.

01:16:00.620 --> 01:16:03.206
You know, I'm a teenager.
That's what teenagers do.

01:16:03.206 --> 01:16:05.333
We torture our parents.

01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:10.088
It actually just means
that I've accepted you a long time ago.

01:16:10.088 --> 01:16:12.590
Oh.

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:14.008
Oh, okay.

01:16:21.557 --> 01:16:24.310
Well, as your mother,

01:16:24.811 --> 01:16:27.188
I just wanna say you can be
a real bitch sometimes.

01:16:29.691 --> 01:16:30.692
Fair enough.

01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:04.559
Stay back. Stay back, stay back.

01:17:05.351 --> 01:17:06.978
Be careful, be careful.

01:17:09.188 --> 01:17:10.982
Be careful, Carol. Be careful!

01:17:10.982 --> 01:17:13.443
Run, run! Get help!

01:17:13.443 --> 01:17:15.278
- You sure?
- Yes! Get your coat. Go!

01:17:16.279 --> 01:17:18.114
I'm right behind you, honey. Go!

01:17:22.785 --> 01:17:23.870
Okay.

01:17:24.537 --> 01:17:25.788
Okay.

01:17:27.415 --> 01:17:28.416
Nice elves.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:30.209
Stay.

01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:36.632
Get back! Get back! Get back, you little--

01:17:42.138 --> 01:17:43.264
Oh, my God.

01:18:20.676 --> 01:18:22.011
Stay back!

01:19:29.078 --> 01:19:30.830
Mom!

01:19:51.309 --> 01:19:52.768
Think happy thoughts.

01:20:36.604 --> 01:20:38.105
Ah!

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.213
Oh, thank God.

01:21:02.213 --> 01:21:03.756
We need your help.

01:21:03.756 --> 01:21:05.508
Okay. What happened?

01:21:05.508 --> 01:21:07.009
- Angry elves.
- Yes.

01:21:07.552 --> 01:21:11.013
- Uh... [chuckles] Elves?
- They're real. They're trying to kill us.

01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:14.183
Carol and Nora are still there.
We have to save them.

01:21:14.183 --> 01:21:15.434
Uh...

01:21:18.604 --> 01:21:22.316
Do you think you could wait to answer
your Christmas calls until later?

01:21:22.316 --> 01:21:23.818
But it's you.

01:21:25.736 --> 01:21:26.946
- May I?
- Look.

01:21:26.946 --> 01:21:28.406
You are here, so...

01:21:28.406 --> 01:21:30.199
- Hello?
- <i>They took her.</i>

01:21:30.908 --> 01:21:32.785
<i>- Bill, they took Nora!</i>
- What?

01:21:32.785 --> 01:21:34.745
- I don't know where she is.
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

01:21:34.745 --> 01:21:36.872
- I can't find her.
<i>- Oh, Jesus.</i>

01:21:36.872 --> 01:21:37.957
I'm sorry.

01:21:38.791 --> 01:21:39.667
Uh...

01:21:41.752 --> 01:21:43.796
Carol? Shit!

01:21:43.796 --> 01:21:46.424
She's gonna be okay, bud.
She's gonna be okay, buddy.

01:21:46.424 --> 01:21:49.885
- Uh, call the policewoman right now.
- She's dead.

01:21:49.885 --> 01:21:51.637
The sheriff is dead. We watched her die.

01:21:51.637 --> 01:21:53.931
- Uh... what?
- Do you have a gun?

01:21:53.931 --> 01:21:55.516
Do you have a gun?

01:21:55.516 --> 01:21:57.435
No, no, no. I don't have any guns.

01:21:57.435 --> 01:22:00.688
- Why doesn't anyone here have guns?
- Because this isn't America.

01:22:00.688 --> 01:22:03.357
We don't go around
and shoot each other in the face.

01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:07.028
You see, in Norway,
we believe in dialogue,

01:22:07.028 --> 01:22:09.530
hearing each other,
"What do you want?" "What do I want?"

01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:11.699
"Let's meet at the middle."
Finding solutions.

01:22:11.699 --> 01:22:14.744
Like the Oslo Agreement.
Have you ever heard of the Oslo Agreement?

01:22:14.744 --> 01:22:15.661
No.

01:22:15.661 --> 01:22:19.957
We negotiated peace between Israel
and the Palestinian people.

01:22:19.957 --> 01:22:23.044
- Sir--
- And, uh, it didn't last, but--

01:22:23.044 --> 01:22:25.504
Okay! Thank you for the information.

01:22:25.504 --> 01:22:27.214
Do you have a car? We need it.

01:22:27.214 --> 01:22:28.633
Yes, I have.

01:22:28.633 --> 01:22:31.719
Will you drive us
to save my wife and daughter, please?

01:22:31.719 --> 01:22:33.179
Absolutely.

01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:35.097
Great. Let's go.

01:22:35.097 --> 01:22:37.683
I will just go and get the keys
in the kitchen.

01:22:37.683 --> 01:22:38.768
Thank you.

01:22:38.768 --> 01:22:42.396
And I need to put on
some winter clothes. It's, uh--

01:22:42.396 --> 01:22:44.065
- Will you please hurry up?
- Yes.

01:22:45.775 --> 01:22:46.859
Go faster, please.

01:22:46.859 --> 01:22:50.196
Yes, but I have to take it
a little bit slowly...

01:22:50.821 --> 01:22:53.491
because it's not legal
to drink and drive here in Norway.

01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:56.035
And I have drunken
two liters of alcohol already.

01:23:00.164 --> 01:23:01.707
Be quiet. They could be anywhere.

01:23:09.090 --> 01:23:11.133
What the motherfucker?

01:23:13.344 --> 01:23:14.178
Oi.

01:23:40.788 --> 01:23:41.789
They're real.

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.001
They definitely are.

01:23:50.881 --> 01:23:53.509
What on earth did you do
to make them so mad?

01:23:54.885 --> 01:23:56.387
We broke all the rules.

01:23:57.304 --> 01:23:58.764
What? All of them?

01:23:59.432 --> 01:24:00.266
Yep.

01:24:03.561 --> 01:24:04.562
Oi, oi, oi, oi.

01:24:12.778 --> 01:24:13.696
Oh...

01:24:22.204 --> 01:24:23.539
Oi, oi, oi, oi.

01:24:43.225 --> 01:24:45.770
Okay. Okay, let's go.

01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.526
You think Mom and Nora are down there?

01:24:53.110 --> 01:24:54.278
Shit.

01:24:55.279 --> 01:24:57.531
- Okay, careful, buddy.
- Okay.

01:25:07.625 --> 01:25:08.793
I'm not surprised.

01:25:10.628 --> 01:25:14.381
For hundreds of years,
humans and elves have been friends.

01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:18.010
We fed them, they helped us.

01:25:18.010 --> 01:25:20.638
I can only imagine their frustration.

01:25:21.931 --> 01:25:22.932
Poor elves.

01:25:23.432 --> 01:25:24.934
Whose side are you on?

01:25:24.934 --> 01:25:26.185
What do you mean, "sides"?

01:25:26.185 --> 01:25:29.522
When negotiating a peace,
it's important to understand both sides.

01:25:30.898 --> 01:25:33.567
Raymond is dead, the sheriff is dead.

01:25:33.567 --> 01:25:35.820
- There's no peace.
- So, what's the alternative?

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:38.614
We kill them, they kill us,
until there's no one left?

01:25:39.281 --> 01:25:41.283
This isn't Detroit, Bill.

01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:48.749
- Have you ever heard of Mother Teresa?
- Okay, shut up.

01:26:20.114 --> 01:26:21.866
- Oh, my God.
- Mom!

01:26:23.909 --> 01:26:26.287
- Nora!
- Lucas!

01:26:26.287 --> 01:26:27.955
- Nora!
- Lucas!

01:26:29.498 --> 01:26:30.332
Mom!

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:32.251
Honey.

01:26:32.251 --> 01:26:33.961
Oh, my God, you're alive.

01:26:36.422 --> 01:26:38.173
- Oh, sweetie.
- Untie us.

01:26:38.173 --> 01:26:39.508
I'm trying, I'm trying.

01:26:41.260 --> 01:26:43.554
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, no.

01:26:50.144 --> 01:26:53.647
What, they have guns now? What...?

01:27:02.698 --> 01:27:06.076
My name is... Tor Åge.

01:27:10.956 --> 01:27:13.500
My name is Tor Åge.

01:27:18.672 --> 01:27:21.508
I think if we can sit down...

01:27:22.801 --> 01:27:24.929
and talk to each other,

01:27:24.929 --> 01:27:26.513
we can find a solution...

01:27:28.015 --> 01:27:30.768
that fits both sides.

01:27:37.608 --> 01:27:39.818
Have you heard about the Oslo Agreement?

01:27:45.824 --> 01:27:48.410
It's a peace agreement between Israel--

01:27:50.996 --> 01:27:53.457
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- No!

01:28:29.410 --> 01:28:30.953
- Bill!
- I'm trying.

01:28:30.953 --> 01:28:32.413
Try harder!

01:28:32.413 --> 01:28:34.373
I'm trying as hard as I can!

01:28:49.054 --> 01:28:51.557
- What are you doing?
- Mom, Dad! He's a friend!

01:28:57.479 --> 01:29:00.733
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:29:08.032 --> 01:29:09.700
Motherfuck--

01:29:31.722 --> 01:29:32.890
Hurry!

01:29:40.272 --> 01:29:42.941
Why does he have the only gun in Norway?

01:29:46.779 --> 01:29:47.613
Uh...

01:29:49.823 --> 01:29:51.909
No, no. Oh, no.

01:29:57.164 --> 01:29:57.998
Oh, my God.

01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.376
Okay. It's okay.

01:30:11.637 --> 01:30:13.764
Stay back! Stay back!

01:30:34.034 --> 01:30:36.703
Up the ladder. Quick!

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:42.084
Stay back!

01:30:42.084 --> 01:30:43.877
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

01:30:57.766 --> 01:31:00.102
Let's go! Let's go!

01:31:05.691 --> 01:31:06.900
Come on, Dad.

01:31:10.737 --> 01:31:12.072
Nora, what are you doing?

01:31:12.739 --> 01:31:14.825
- Guys, come on. Let's go!
- Come on!

01:31:14.825 --> 01:31:16.118
I got this.

01:31:26.128 --> 01:31:27.754
We got this. You go.

01:31:30.632 --> 01:31:31.758
Go!

01:31:31.758 --> 01:31:32.759
Okay.

01:32:02.497 --> 01:32:04.708
Merry Christmas, you little fuckers.

01:32:18.972 --> 01:32:20.390
- Oh, shit.
- Let's go!

01:32:39.243 --> 01:32:40.410
- You did it!
- Yeah.

01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:43.914
- Are you okay? Oh, God.
- You all right?

01:32:43.914 --> 01:32:45.540
Oh, thank God.

01:32:55.092 --> 01:32:56.885
There goes the happy barn.

01:32:57.636 --> 01:32:59.346
Yeah. Well...

01:33:07.813 --> 01:33:08.814
Hey, guys!

01:33:09.481 --> 01:33:10.816
I'm fine.

01:33:10.816 --> 01:33:12.442
No, no, no. No danger.

01:33:12.442 --> 01:33:15.445
These guys won't harm you.
They want peace.

01:33:15.445 --> 01:33:17.281
Yes, I knew it.

01:33:17.864 --> 01:33:21.785
All it took was a little bit of dialogue,
a little bit of mutual understanding,

01:33:21.785 --> 01:33:24.079
and we came to a peaceful agreement.

01:33:25.163 --> 01:33:26.164
Right, guys?

01:33:26.164 --> 01:33:27.958
We had a long, friendly chat--

01:33:28.834 --> 01:33:31.044
Ow!

01:33:37.884 --> 01:33:41.221
So why are you burning down the barn?

01:33:42.931 --> 01:33:45.392
It was either us or them, so...

01:33:49.813 --> 01:33:51.940
Poor little guy.

01:33:52.899 --> 01:33:54.526
He's lost his home now, so...

01:33:56.778 --> 01:33:58.196
where's he supposed to go?

01:34:02.659 --> 01:34:03.952
Can he live with us?

01:34:04.828 --> 01:34:06.621
Honey, he can't stay here.

01:34:07.247 --> 01:34:09.291
We'd just piss him off again.

01:34:10.334 --> 01:34:12.169
Yeah, sorry, buddy. Your mom's right.

01:34:28.143 --> 01:34:28.977
Huh?

01:34:29.728 --> 01:34:30.562
What?

01:34:33.565 --> 01:34:34.900
So here we are.

01:34:35.567 --> 01:34:37.569
Welcome to my museum.

01:34:38.528 --> 01:34:44.284
As you see, really old-fashioned,
simple houses with no electricity.

01:34:44.284 --> 01:34:46.703
And absolutely no visitors.

01:34:46.703 --> 01:34:50.165
So peaceful and quiet.
It's perfect for an elf.

01:34:50.165 --> 01:34:51.583
And you're an elf.

01:34:55.128 --> 01:34:58.006
I'll see you around... friend.

01:34:59.007 --> 01:35:00.133
Mm-hm.

01:35:04.096 --> 01:35:07.432
You have to promise me
you'll take good care of him.

01:35:07.432 --> 01:35:08.850
It will be an honor.

01:35:10.143 --> 01:35:13.146
Like 20 minutes ago,
we were all trying to kill each other,

01:35:13.146 --> 01:35:15.440
but sure, let's all be friends now.

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.692
- Fuck me.
- Oh!

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:19.194
- Look.
- What?

01:35:19.194 --> 01:35:20.821
What the hell?

01:35:23.073 --> 01:35:26.159
Wow!

01:35:26.159 --> 01:35:29.913
It's happening.
It's happening. I love it here.

01:35:42.175 --> 01:35:43.593
When all is said and done...

01:35:45.178 --> 01:35:47.556
this was a pretty good Christmas.

01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:52.602
- Are you kidding?
- It was a nightmare, Dad.

01:35:52.602 --> 01:35:54.229
People died.

01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:55.856
Yes, I know, sure.

01:35:55.856 --> 01:35:57.357
But look at us, huh?

01:35:58.024 --> 01:35:59.860
As a family, we all bonded.

01:36:00.694 --> 01:36:02.028
That's priceless.
