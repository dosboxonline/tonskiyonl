09:36.826 --> 09:39.412
of dusty old board games to keep us busy.

09:41.873 --> 09:44.042
Did you put yourself into a time-out?

09:44.125 --> 09:46.002
No, there's better Wi-Fi over here.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.797
I-I didn't know if the kids
were trying to call or text me

09:48.880 --> 09:50.882
and maybe I just didn't have service.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.926
Do you want to go upstairs
and watch TV instead?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.470
No, I don't want to watch TV.
I want my kids to call me

09:55.553 --> 09:57.305
with more information.
I want to teleport

09:57.389 --> 09:59.516
my body to Los Angeles.
I want...

10:01.017 --> 10:02.644
I want a cocktail.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.895
(chuckles)

10:03.978 --> 10:06.481
No, I'm-I'm not kidding.
I want a cocktail.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.609
Are you sure? The doctor said
with the meds, you could...

10:09.693 --> 10:12.153
One drink every once in a while
would not kill me.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.780
(chuckles):
And in this case,

10:13.863 --> 10:15.865
I feel like
it might actually save my life.

10:15.949 --> 10:18.368
Well, I mean, how would
a cocktail really compare

10:18.451 --> 10:20.036
to Girl Talk: A Game of Truth or Dare?

10:20.120 --> 10:21.371
Or your life.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.457
Me having a cocktail might save your life.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.043
One cocktail coming right up.

I had gone to a football school

12:59.029 --> 13:01.823
This baby is a mathematical anomaly.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.576
He's a product greater than the constants

you had more than one shot

after our wedding.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.412
Excuse me.
I was in Puerto Rico.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.331
I was married.

it's flooded.

-Oh.
-I'm gonna go to the hardware store,

14:12.727 --> 14:14.646
get some stuff to stop all that.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.189
What was in the boxes?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.233
Um, well, that's some of

14:18.316 --> 14:19.984
the kids' old art we brought from home.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.529
We were gonna frame it and put it up,

-Nothing.

14:46.469 --> 14:48.555
No, I haven't.

Look, forget it.
Doesn't matter.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.850

-Let's just toss it and move on.
-Jack.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.936

Uh, I'd be pacing back and forth
in the waiting room if I could,

15:21.755 --> 15:24.466
but don't worry, I'll-I'll stay
over here in my-my zone.

15:24.549 --> 15:26.343
I won't get too close.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.638
Uh, are those... are those pigs on your...

15:30.722 --> 15:33.141
(both chuckle)

15:33.224 --> 15:36.186
Pigs are a thing with Rose, my wife.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.857
We went to Austria on our honeymoon

15:40.940 --> 15:44.527
because <i>The Sound of Music</i>
came out that year and...

15:44.611 --> 15:46.780
she wanted to see Salzburg.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.782
I get it.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.575
I made Kate move to Pasadena

15:50.658 --> 15:53.036
just for the <i>Back to the Future</i> house.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.957
We were there over New Year's.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.335
Turns out the Austrians
go all out for pigs

16:00.418 --> 16:01.628
over New Year's.

16:02.754 --> 16:07.258
Pigs on platters and marzipan pigs,

16:07.342 --> 16:09.761
little pig tchotchkes in all the markets.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.598
They say they bring good luck.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.976
So...

16:17.060 --> 16:19.896
to start our marriage off right,

16:19.979 --> 16:22.232
we bought this little sucker.

16:25.235 --> 16:28.655
And over the years,
whenever we needed a little luck...

16:29.739 --> 16:31.324
You found yourself a pig.

16:34.703 --> 16:39.290
Figured I'd bring the whole
bacon army out for this one.

16:41.459 --> 16:43.003
They say they might be able

16:43.086 --> 16:45.213
to take her off
the ventilator soon, but...

16:45.296 --> 16:47.173
Hey, that's...

16:47.257 --> 16:50.093
you know, that's not...
that's not nothing, right?

16:50.176 --> 16:51.970
So you, uh...

16:52.053 --> 16:54.723
you haven't been able
to go inside at all, huh?

16:54.806 --> 16:56.141
No.

16:56.224 --> 16:58.601
She made me promise not to visit.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.770
She didn't want me getting sick, too.

17:02.063 --> 17:04.983
(chuckles)
If you think I'm stubborn,

17:05.066 --> 17:06.735
you ought to meet my Rose.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.279
(laughs)

17:09.362 --> 17:11.239
Yeah.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.075
Kate can be kind of stubborn, too.

17:14.159 --> 17:15.243
Is that why you're out here?

17:15.326 --> 17:16.745
She kick you out of the delivery room?

17:16.828 --> 17:19.831
Oh, uh, no.

17:19.914 --> 17:22.584
We're actually adopting.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.919
Yeah, she's in there with the birth mom,

17:25.003 --> 17:28.048
and there's only one visitor allowed.

17:28.131 --> 17:31.426
But we made a deal--
since she gets to be in there,

17:31.509 --> 17:33.845
I get to pick the middle name.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.138
Anything I want.

17:35.221 --> 17:37.724
She has no veto rights.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.352
-That's a lot of pressure.
-Yeah.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.937
Yeah, I have quite the list going on.

17:43.021 --> 17:45.315
I'm having a hard time whittling it down.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.985
I don't want to pick it out just yet.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.529
You know?

17:51.613 --> 17:54.908
I want to wait till she's here,
until she's officially ours.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.080
Just don't want to jinx it.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.352

how this family was

22:25.679 --> 22:27.931
Uh, I quit the movie.

22:28.014 --> 22:29.557
Yeah, no, I don't want to take jobs

22:29.641 --> 22:31.976

-when there's something to hear.
-Yeah.

26:08.151 --> 26:09.694

-The blobs.

What's all this?

This is the best possible solution

I could find to try and save them.

26:26.044 --> 26:28.088
I'm gonna go get my hair dryer.

26:28.171 --> 26:29.839
No, Bec.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.841
It's fine.
They-they're ruined.

26:31.925 --> 26:33.927
Really, I'm-I'm over it.

26:36.137 --> 26:38.056
Jack...

26:38.139 --> 26:41.142
making fun of our kids together
is our thing.

26:41.226 --> 26:43.520
It's our one coping mechanism

26:43.603 --> 26:45.438
against three sets of teenage hormones.

26:45.522 --> 26:46.856
Yeah, I know.
You're right.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.317
So, what is the deal?

26:53.196 --> 26:55.699
They don't want to hang out
with us anymore.

26:56.908 --> 27:01.496
(sighs)
It's-it's... it's moving really fast.

27:01.579 --> 27:04.249
You know, they-they like us one moment,
and then the next...

27:04.332 --> 27:06.543
They're teenagers.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.211
It's perfectly normal that they want to

27:08.294 --> 27:10.296
hang out with other teenagers over us.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.674
I know, but we only have

27:12.757 --> 27:15.552
a few more years together
under the same roof.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.596
Okay, a few more years
where we get to be a part

27:18.680 --> 27:21.516
of their daily lives.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.560
And then what?

27:23.643 --> 27:24.978
They're gonna move out.

27:25.061 --> 27:26.396
And forget vacations to the cabin.

27:26.479 --> 27:30.025
Babe, w-we're gonna
be lucky if they call us

27:30.108 --> 27:33.236
once a week just to let us know
what's going on in their lives.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.072
Babe, it is not gonna be like that.

27:37.365 --> 27:38.908
It was like that for us.

27:38.992 --> 27:40.827
We moved out of our parents' houses,

27:40.910 --> 27:42.912
and we never looked back.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.539
Okay.

27:44.622 --> 27:48.209
You being moody I can handle,
but comparing us to our parents,

27:48.293 --> 27:50.211
that is a bridge too far, mister.

27:50.295 --> 27:51.963
(Jack chuckles)

27:52.047 --> 27:56.634
Jack, our family is not
ending anytime soon.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.928
Come here.
Come here.

28:01.598 --> 28:02.766
Look at this picture.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.726
Do you see how the colors

28:04.809 --> 28:06.936
from their little handprints have...
have soaked

28:07.020 --> 28:08.646
all the way down to ours?

28:09.981 --> 28:12.942
We're all still there together.

28:13.026 --> 28:17.197
We are, even if it doesn't look
the way that it used to.

28:18.656 --> 28:21.284
And even when we are old fogeys

28:21.368 --> 28:23.078
living out here in the woods one day

28:23.161 --> 28:27.332
like witches from
some children's fairy tale,

28:27.415 --> 28:30.877
we're still gonna be close to them.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.796
Didn't realize we were gonna be witches.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.423
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I'm gonna let myself really go.

28:35.507 --> 28:37.092
Oh, okay.

28:37.175 --> 28:39.010
We will never miss a thing.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.262
Not the little stuff,

28:41.346 --> 28:43.598
and especially not the big stuff.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.185
Mm.

28:49.562 --> 28:51.231
(Jack chuckles)

28:51.314 --> 28:53.566
REBECCA:
So we framed it,

28:53.650 --> 28:57.862
as a... reminder

28:57.946 --> 28:59.906
to always be close,

28:59.989 --> 29:02.325
never miss a thing.

29:03.493 --> 29:07.789
I know it's silly, but I feel like...

29:07.872 --> 29:09.749
like I'm letting down Jack

29:09.833 --> 29:12.794
by not being there for them today.

29:12.877 --> 29:15.630
Like I'm-I'm not holding up
my end of the promise.

29:15.714 --> 29:17.549
-Rebecca, you...
-No, it-it's okay.

29:17.632 --> 29:19.884
You don't have to make me feel better.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.639
We never talk about this.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.852
How you...

29:28.935 --> 29:32.147
have to bear Jack's death differently.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.274
For yourself...

29:34.357 --> 29:36.818
and for me.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.486
And our marriage.

29:43.074 --> 29:44.659
Thank you.

29:47.037 --> 29:49.414
I know it's a lot.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.041
I know I'm a lot.

29:51.124 --> 29:53.251
(sighs)
Hey.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.506
You're just the right amount.

30:10.435 --> 30:12.187
Hi, little one.

30:16.649 --> 30:18.651
So you're the reason
I've been skipping cold cuts

30:18.735 --> 30:20.737
for the last nine months, huh?

30:22.989 --> 30:25.492
You should know that I live and die

30:25.575 --> 30:28.912
by pastrami on rye, so...

30:28.995 --> 30:31.206
this hasn't been easy for me.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.878
But...

30:36.961 --> 30:41.675
from the minute that I knew
that you were real

30:41.758 --> 30:43.885
and I was really having you...

30:45.887 --> 30:48.682
...I knew that I needed
to take care of you.

30:53.895 --> 30:56.898
Even if you were never meant to be mine.

30:56.981 --> 30:59.109
Giving you to Toby and Kate is

30:59.192 --> 31:00.902
the hardest thing I have ever done.

31:03.488 --> 31:06.199
But it might just be
the best thing I'll ever do.

31:08.702 --> 31:12.539
So I have to say goodbye to you now,

31:12.622 --> 31:15.041
because there is someone really special

31:15.125 --> 31:17.293
waiting to say hello.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.922
(soft knocking)

31:23.049 --> 31:25.010
KATE:
Hi.

31:26.094 --> 31:28.013
Hi.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.514
Thank you.

31:29.597 --> 31:31.933
Hi, sweet girl.

31:32.017 --> 31:34.936
Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.896
Oh, my goodness.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.356
Hi.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.694
I'm your mom.

31:44.821 --> 31:47.657
(chuckles, sighs)

31:53.163 --> 31:56.082
I feel like I have waited
my whole life to meet you.

31:59.127 --> 32:01.212
I can't wait to watch you grow up.

32:02.839 --> 32:06.009
To French-braid your hair.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.720
And to make Play-Doh castles together.

32:10.722 --> 32:12.807
And I got to be honest with you.

32:14.559 --> 32:16.478
The world is...
it's a little nutty out there

32:16.561 --> 32:19.564
right now, but...

32:19.647 --> 32:23.151
no matter what, no matter what,

32:23.234 --> 32:25.945
I can promise you this:

32:26.029 --> 32:29.240
You will never, ever...

32:29.324 --> 32:31.284
doubt your place in it.

33:12.659 --> 33:14.411
yeah, something like that.

33:14.494 --> 33:15.829
(both chuckle)

33:15.912 --> 33:18.873
Oh, my goodness, look at all that hair.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.750
What I wouldn't give.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.044
She's like Fabio in his prime.

33:23.128 --> 33:25.213
<i>(chuckling):</i>
<i>I know.</i>

33:26.297 --> 33:28.299

33:31.386 --> 33:33.221
(Randall grunts)

33:33.304 --> 33:34.931
Oh, it's Kev.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.851
Well,

33:37.934 --> 33:41.521
<i>how does it feel to be</i>
<i>the Pearson family's newest dad?</i>

33:41.604 --> 33:43.023
(laughs)

33:43.106 --> 33:45.233
Yeah. Man, I can't believe
I'm a dad, dude.

33:45.316 --> 33:46.317
(chuckles)

33:46.401 --> 33:47.819
Congrats, Papa Bear.

33:47.902 --> 33:49.320
-Beth says...
<i>-I heard.</i>

33:49.404 --> 33:51.865
Yeah, no, I heard.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

33:51.948 --> 33:53.491
Uh, you got names?

33:53.575 --> 33:55.118
<i>Names? Yes.</i>

33:55.201 --> 33:57.996
Uh, Nicholas and Frances.

33:58.079 --> 34:00.206
Nicholas.

34:00.290 --> 34:03.793
Oh, man, Uncle Nicky
will be through the roof.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.962
And, uh, Frances?

34:06.046 --> 34:08.173
-Frances?
-That's... unique.

34:08.256 --> 34:10.050
<i>I know, I know.</i>
<i>Um,</i>

34:10.133 --> 34:12.302
named after Madison's grandmother.

34:12.385 --> 34:15.138
Um, she gave me Nicky,
so we'll-we'll call her Franny.

34:15.221 --> 34:17.015
Right on.
Franny's cute.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.183
<i>Franny is definitely cute.</i>

34:18.266 --> 34:20.894
<i>-Yeah, yeah.</i>
-(chuckles)

34:23.146 --> 34:24.731
(sighs)

34:24.814 --> 34:26.691
Man, eight hours ago,
I was dragging some guy

34:26.775 --> 34:30.945
out of his totaled SUV,
and now here I am a dad.

34:31.029 --> 34:32.155
(chuckles):
To twins.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.406
<i>Damn.</i>

34:35.200 --> 34:37.452
Yesterday, I was in New Orleans

34:37.535 --> 34:40.872
communing with the spirit of my birth mom.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.166
Now I own her house.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.001
Damn.

34:45.085 --> 34:46.753
Yeah.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.218
We got a lot to catch up on.

34:55.053 --> 34:56.763
Yeah.

35:00.350 --> 35:02.977
Randall, I was terrified
when I was on that plane.

35:04.521 --> 35:07.023
I was terrified that
I wouldn't make it in time,

35:07.107 --> 35:08.900
and I was terrified
that she would be alone,

35:08.983 --> 35:11.778
and when I walked in that room,
man, I heard your voice,

35:11.861 --> 35:14.280
<i>and I, um...</i>

35:17.075 --> 35:18.993
Thank you.
Thank you.

35:21.037 --> 35:22.956
<i>After everything that</i>
<i>we've been through recently,</i>

35:23.039 --> 35:24.374
<i>you're still...</i>

35:24.457 --> 35:26.334
You're my brother.

35:29.045 --> 35:30.672
Yeah.

35:32.841 --> 35:35.719
I did say some... some pretty
horrible things to you, Randall,

35:35.802 --> 35:37.887
and the truth is you are...

35:39.222 --> 35:40.515
(sighs)

35:41.933 --> 35:44.394
You're the best person I know.

35:44.477 --> 35:46.563
<i>And on my finest day,</i>

35:46.646 --> 35:50.859
<i>I am simply doing</i>
<i>a poor man's imitation of you.</i>

35:50.942 --> 35:52.819
Hey, man.

35:52.902 --> 35:54.988
We both said things.

35:55.071 --> 35:57.073
Tensions were high.

36:01.161 --> 36:04.080
We got a lot of ground to cover.

36:04.164 --> 36:06.583
Lot of things I didn't...

36:06.666 --> 36:08.293
(sighs)
see growing up.

36:08.376 --> 36:09.753
<i>Hey, man.</i>

36:09.836 --> 36:12.756
If you really want to have
that conversation with me,

36:12.839 --> 36:15.842
then I cannot wait to have it with you.

36:15.925 --> 36:18.303
And one day, when you don't have

36:18.386 --> 36:21.765
two brand-spanking-new babies
and just went through a whole

36:21.848 --> 36:25.185
Planes, Trains and Automobiles
<i>adventure to get to,</i>

36:25.268 --> 36:27.395
we will have it.

36:27.479 --> 36:29.189
I promise you that.

36:29.272 --> 36:31.149
But now is not the time.

36:31.232 --> 36:35.111
<i>Now is the time to celebrate</i>
<i>your new family.</i>

36:35.195 --> 36:36.780
Yes.

36:38.031 --> 36:40.909
<i>(sighs) I can't believe</i>
<i>you told her the "MMMBop" story.</i>

36:40.992 --> 36:42.660
(laughs)

36:46.873 --> 36:48.875
(door opens)

36:51.002 --> 36:52.587
-(door closes)
-(footsteps approaching)

36:55.674 --> 36:57.300
Hi.

36:58.343 --> 36:59.969
Hi.

37:01.012 --> 37:02.764
What time does your watch say?

37:02.847 --> 37:04.516
Um...

37:04.599 --> 37:06.184
-9:53.
-Mm.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.312
9:53. That's good.

37:09.396 --> 37:12.482
I was worried maybe
all the clocks in the house were fast.

37:12.565 --> 37:14.359
I didn't want to accuse you of being

37:14.442 --> 37:19.197
three hours and 53 minutes late
for no reason.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.491
-Look, Es, I...
-One night.

37:21.574 --> 37:24.494
I asked you for one night
to come home at 6:00

37:24.577 --> 37:27.330
to have dinner with your son.

37:27.414 --> 37:30.166
He was so excited for you
to eat the pizza he made you.

37:30.250 --> 37:31.751
I wanted to make it home.

37:31.835 --> 37:33.545
What could you be doing in that office

37:33.628 --> 37:35.672
that is so much more important than us?

37:35.755 --> 37:37.590
(sighs)

37:37.674 --> 37:40.301
I'm so close to something huge, Es.

37:40.385 --> 37:42.554
No one has created an efficient algorithm

37:42.637 --> 37:45.056
to compute the Karhunen-Loève transform.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.891
So I had the idea to approach the problem

37:46.975 --> 37:48.601
by studying a cosine transform,

37:48.685 --> 37:50.103
-and then...
-No, stop.

37:54.482 --> 37:57.277
If I am going to forgive you,

37:57.360 --> 37:59.362
then I need to understand why

37:59.446 --> 38:02.115
what you are doing matters so much to you.

38:03.575 --> 38:07.162
So explain it to me so I will understand.

38:07.245 --> 38:09.831
Explain it to me like I'm...

38:09.914 --> 38:12.917
like I'm our four-year-old son.

38:15.003 --> 38:16.796
-(Rebecca sighs)
-MIGUEL: All right, well,

38:16.880 --> 38:20.258
you want to move on to something else?

38:20.342 --> 38:23.261
No, it's-it's late.
I think I'm all gamed out.

38:23.345 --> 38:24.846
-Okay.
-(phone ringing)

38:28.350 --> 38:29.559
(gasps)

38:29.642 --> 38:32.520
Oh, God, it's Kate.

38:32.604 --> 38:35.648
When your mother wants a picture
of Mike, what do we do?

38:35.732 --> 38:37.609
We mail it to her.

38:37.692 --> 38:39.361
Right. We mail it to Argentina.

38:39.444 --> 38:41.363
She gets it a few weeks later.

38:41.446 --> 38:44.115
What if, instead of waiting for the mail,

38:44.199 --> 38:48.953
she could see the photo
on a computer almost instantly?

38:49.037 --> 38:51.414
What do you mean?

38:51.498 --> 38:53.500
The military has created
a network of computers

38:53.583 --> 38:55.794
around the world that are all connected.

38:55.877 --> 38:58.963
Soon, common people will have them,

38:59.047 --> 39:03.760
and if my team can optimize
a form of data compression,

39:03.843 --> 39:05.845
they'll be able to share images.

39:07.097 --> 39:10.058
So, you put a picture on a computer,

39:10.141 --> 39:13.520
and my mother across the world
sees the same picture?

39:13.603 --> 39:17.065
Yes, and imagine if one day
it wasn't just a picture.

39:17.148 --> 39:18.900
Imagine it was a movie.

39:18.983 --> 39:22.904
Imagine you could talk
to someone on a screen,

39:22.987 --> 39:27.325
like a phone call but with video.

39:28.410 --> 39:29.869
(chuckles)

39:29.953 --> 39:31.329
-Hi. Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, Kate.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.956
<i>-KATE: Hi, Mom.</i>
-Hi.

39:33.039 --> 39:34.916
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't call</i>
<i>during the labor.</i>

39:35.000 --> 39:36.459
<i>It got really intense in there.</i>

39:36.543 --> 39:39.713
-It's okay.
<i>-But, um, she's here.</i>

39:39.796 --> 39:42.924
<i>She's here. Do you want to meet</i>
<i>your granddaughter?</i>

39:43.008 --> 39:46.052
Yes, I do. We do.

39:46.136 --> 39:48.346

39:48.430 --> 39:49.764
