WEBVTT

00:32.950 --> 00:36.119
The last time I spent this long in bed,
was because I strained a hamstring.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.217
Should we…

00:51.677 --> 00:52.886
tell people about us?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.474
I'm enjoying the secrecy.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.353
Sneaking around at work.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.566
Doesn't it feel scandalous and fun?

01:05.649 --> 01:09.278
No. It's so stressful.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.904
I'm going gray.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.657
I have not seen one gray hair anywhere.

01:13.740 --> 01:14.992
It's not on my head.

01:16.618 --> 01:19.663
It's not down there.
It's in my armpits. See?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.251
Problem solved.

01:25.836 --> 01:29.339
You know, if we told people about us,

01:29.423 --> 01:30.966
then I could do this…

01:31.550 --> 01:32.551
in public.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.929
You are not gonna
let this one go, are you?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.848
No, I am not.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.061
You know, we have the weekend off.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.190
Then I'm in.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.401
-Where are we going?
-How about Greece?

01:49.484 --> 01:51.028
Oh, my God, Mother!

01:53.405 --> 01:55.532
Excellent,
that's where my spare keys went.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.576
Sam, you remember my mother?

01:57.659 --> 02:00.204
It's a pleasure
to formally meet you, Deborah.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.247
I sincerely wish
I wasn't in my boxers right now.

02:02.873 --> 02:04.041
Boxer briefs.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.293
And like clunky exposition,

02:06.376 --> 02:08.336
they leave very little to the imagination.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.670
I am so sorry.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.633
Right, okay, that's all the pleasantries
out of the way.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.800
So come on, Mother.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.011
What's my father done this time?

02:17.054 --> 02:18.138
He died.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.047
So where do you think
her father is right now?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.799
In the drawer of a funeral home.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.635
No. I mean, like, spiritually.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.304
In the drawer of a funeral home.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.723
You know, growing up,
I used to believe that

03:01.807 --> 03:03.559
if you did good things,
you went to heaven.

03:03.642 --> 03:05.519
You did bad things, you went to hell.

03:05.602 --> 03:09.731
Nowadays, I know we all just do both.
So wherever he is, I hope he's happy.

03:10.315 --> 03:13.360
I like to imagine a heaven
where animals are in charge,

03:13.443 --> 03:14.862
and humans are the pets.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.866
I'd like to spend eternity
curled up in front of a fire

03:19.700 --> 03:21.285
at Cindy Clawford's feet.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.494
Yeah.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.621
I'd like to be reincarnated as a tiger…

03:25.956 --> 03:28.166
and then ravage anyone
who looked at me wrong.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.088
You know, if you weigh
a person's body right after death,

03:33.172 --> 03:34.923
it's 21.3 grams lighter,

03:35.507 --> 03:38.302
and some say that's
the weight of the soul.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.430
Whoever figured that out

03:41.513 --> 03:44.683
clearly weighed someone,
murdered them, then weighed them again.

03:46.101 --> 03:48.562
You live, you die, you're done.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.771
Good night.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.569
-He's on his period.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:56.987 --> 04:00.908
Oi, so we're all going
to this funeral as a team.

04:01.825 --> 04:05.954
So that means ties, shirts…

04:07.247 --> 04:09.374
-and no trainers.
-What?

04:10.792 --> 04:11.793
Okay.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.795
Well, what if they're,
like, really nice Yeezys?

04:13.879 --> 04:15.797
-Yeah.
-What color?

04:17.507 --> 04:18.591
Bright red.

04:21.637 --> 04:23.680
Okay, I'll wear some dress shoes.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.225
Where do you get dress shoes?

04:26.308 --> 04:28.143
I don't have time to stand
in line at midnight

04:28.227 --> 04:30.020
and wait till morning to buy new shoes.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.481
You don't have to do that
for shoes like these, mate.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.941
Nobody wants them.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.916
Oh, my God! This fucking song!

04:51.500 --> 04:53.460
Mother, turn it off!

04:54.336 --> 04:56.046
Hang on! Hang on, sausage.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.130
I can't hear you.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.258
Of course you can't fucking hear me.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.928
-What did you want?
-Why are you playing that song?

05:03.011 --> 05:06.682
I'm sorry. I like to have it playing
in every room in the house when I wake up.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.308
It just makes me feel happy.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.103
Well, you shouldn't feel happy today.

05:11.186 --> 05:13.397
You should feel happy every day, Rebecca.

05:13.480 --> 05:14.731
Do you want to talk about that?

05:15.524 --> 05:17.317
No-- I am happy.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.570
I don't need to talk about anything.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.698
You know, the old Rebecca
used to love that song.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.825
Yeah, well,
the whole world used to love that song.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.786
Then we heard it ad nauseam,
and now we're over it.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.746
Well, I don't work that way.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.874
Once I love something, I love it forever.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.921
You know, you can change this room
to whatever you want.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.591
You don't need to keep it
like this for me.

05:42.134 --> 05:45.512
No, it reminds me of when we were close.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.389
I want it that way.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.350
Now I know what song I want to play next.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.352
Oh, no!

05:52.436 --> 05:53.729
Good morning, Stinky.

05:58.775 --> 06:01.195
What the hell are you thinking?

06:01.278 --> 06:02.905
Just wanted to see if I could still do it.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.491
Those Tracy Anderson workouts are having
the right effect.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.951
Nora, hurry up!

06:08.035 --> 06:10.787
I'm taking my time and being careful.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.081
When I was your age,
I could do this in seconds.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.166
That's true.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.542
While drunk, by the way.

06:15.626 --> 06:17.753
Florence, darling, it's been ages.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.838
-Deborah.
-Thank you for coming.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.383
Nora and I are here
for anything you need, okay?

06:23.467 --> 06:24.718
Isn't that right, Nora?

06:25.969 --> 06:27.888
-Nora!
-Oh, God.

06:30.849 --> 06:31.975
I'm okay.

06:37.564 --> 06:39.399
Funerals are weird, aren't they?

06:39.483 --> 06:40.776
Yeah.

06:40.859 --> 06:41.944
Yeah.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.988
They're like a party,

06:45.072 --> 06:46.365
but for sad people.

06:47.366 --> 06:50.118
Like where everyone knows
they have to go and be sad.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.829
Maybe you're not sad,

06:53.455 --> 06:55.123
but you have to go and be sad.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.334
I think that's weird.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.836
Yeah, they're horrible.

07:01.171 --> 07:04.299
Roy, if you die,
do you want to be buried or cremated?

07:04.383 --> 07:06.802
Like, if you were hit by a bus today,
what do I do?

07:07.970 --> 07:11.181
Go after the bus driver
and make him pay for what he did to me.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.850
Avenge me, Keeley.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.393
Avenge me!

07:16.311 --> 07:18.230
This funeral is really messing
with your head, innit?

07:18.313 --> 07:19.982
I found this company,

07:20.899 --> 07:23.861
and they bury you in a biodegradable sack.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.779
So when your body decomposes,

07:25.863 --> 07:28.240
it fertilizes the seeds of a fruit tree.

07:28.323 --> 07:29.616
That's what I want.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.785
Because then you
and all the people that love me

07:31.869 --> 07:33.537
can eat the fruit from my tree.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.247
That is fucking mental.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.959
Coming from the guy
that wants me to ruin a bus driver's life

07:39.042 --> 07:42.171
just 'cause he killed you
swerving to avoid a child.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.256
I didn't know about the fucking child.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.595
I just like the idea
that my death can nourish people.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.972
With fruit made from your rotting corpse?

07:52.598 --> 07:53.891
I wouldn't eat that.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.227
But you'll eat a kebab
that you find a hair in?

07:57.311 --> 07:59.188
It's fine if you know
who the hair is from.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.398
That's part of the deal.
He's a lovely bloke.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.736
-You're not really angry, are you?
-Yes, I actually am.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.906
And now we have to go to
a funeral and act sad.

08:12.201 --> 08:13.327
Well, now I am sad.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.372
Shit.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.050
We're so sorry for your loss.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.886
Oh, my goodness.
I can't believe you made it.

09:12.970 --> 09:15.597
-Of course.
-Dad always loved you both.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.936
Who are they?

09:21.019 --> 09:22.187
I've no idea.

09:22.855 --> 09:24.523
My darling, Deborah.

09:24.606 --> 09:25.649
Rupert.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.776
My sincerest condolences.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.654
Didn't think you were coming.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.781
Rebecca, Paul was family.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.700
No, I mean because you weren't invited.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.661
It's lovely to see you, Rupie.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.166
And introducing Diane.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.253
What a chubby baby.

09:47.671 --> 09:50.632
Congratulations, Mother.
You've just fat-shamed a baby to tears.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.134
Come here.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.517
Et voilà, the magic touch.

10:00.601 --> 10:02.019
It's not magic.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.355
I ate the placenta raw, and she knows it.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.151
Yeah,
I had all the TVs in the house removed.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.153
I just sit around and watch them all day.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.571
How lovely.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.114
Excuse me.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.917
-My condolences.
-Thank you, Leslie.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.294
Sorry, Ms. Welton.

10:29.713 --> 10:30.797
Sorry for your loss.

10:30.881 --> 10:33.342
-How many of them came?
-All of them.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.015
And none of them are wearing trainers.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.767
That's how much they care about you.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.772
-My feet are killing me, man.
-We'll sit down in a minute, mate.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.441
Deep breaths, mate.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.361
-Rebecca.
-Sam.

10:52.945 --> 10:57.157
And Colin, and Isaac, and Nathan.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.744
Everyone.
Thank you all so much for coming.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.287
I'm sorry for your loss.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.830
Yeah, sorry for your loss.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.958
Yes--

11:07.042 --> 11:10.462
Fathers are the training wheels
on the bikes of…

11:14.132 --> 11:17.010
Sorry-- I just didn't want to say
what they said, so I--

11:17.594 --> 11:18.679
Sorry for your loss.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.115
Sassy.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.076
Oh, decrepit shitbag.

11:41.159 --> 11:45.205
Oh, come on, Sass.
Let's let bygones be bygones, eh?

11:45.289 --> 11:48.041
I've got a daughter now. I've changed.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.376
Oh, right.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.712
Having a daughter erases

11:51.795 --> 11:54.882
all the shitty things
you've done to women in your lifetime.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.008
Cool.

11:56.842 --> 12:02.306
Rupert,
I think about your death every single day.

12:02.973 --> 12:03.974
I can't wait.

12:05.184 --> 12:07.394
I'm gonna wear red to your funeral.

12:08.020 --> 12:12.941
I will be a beacon of joy
to the other three people there.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.403
Always a pleasure, Sassy.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.614
Fuck off and die, Rupert.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.583
Good morning, Ted.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.129
Okay.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.300
Ted, you're-- Ted, you're okay.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.885
Just breathe.

12:40.636 --> 12:43.263
Just focus on your 4-7-8 breathing.

12:45.015 --> 12:47.351
You can. Come on. Just breathe.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.894
I'm on my way.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.239
That baby sucks.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.116
You don't have to say that for me.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.785
I'm not just saying it. I'm serious.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.996
That baby's whack. I hate it.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.750
-I love you.
-I love you too.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.003
-I'm here for you, whatever you need.
-I know.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.381
I won't leave your side.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.635
-Jones!
-Sassy! Oh, my God!

13:23.470 --> 13:24.972
Hi!

13:26.640 --> 13:27.850
I'm used to it.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.018
Sorry for your loss.

13:30.686 --> 13:33.730
-You look amazing!
-Good to see you. Thank you.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.649
You're fine. Keep walking.

13:35.732 --> 13:36.942
God.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.027
I guess we're supposed to be sad.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.863
Yeah, yeah.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.656
Funerals are so weird.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.242
I was literally talking about
that earlier.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.620
-Do you also wanna be a tree when you die?
-Hell yeah.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.622
Or a really stupid dog.

13:51.748 --> 13:53.208
Either one is a great life.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.169
Yeah.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.503
So where's Ted?

13:57.421 --> 13:59.882
-Sassy and Ted, sitting in a tree.
-Oh, God.

13:59.965 --> 14:03.427
-F-U-C-K-I-N-G.
-Shut up, you little troll.

14:04.595 --> 14:07.806
I'm sorry.
I say mean things to beautiful women.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.474
Thanks, Sass.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.853
By the way, record scratch,

14:12.936 --> 14:15.314
but I think Rebecca is
secretly dating someone.

14:15.397 --> 14:16.982
-What?
-For, like, weeks.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.610
Now, is today an inappropriate day

14:19.693 --> 14:23.071
to inquire/badger her into telling us who?

14:23.822 --> 14:25.407
We'll never know unless we try.

14:31.705 --> 14:33.248
-Keeley.
-Jamie.

14:33.749 --> 14:35.125
Wow, nice suit.

14:36.126 --> 14:37.586
All of you. Look at you.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.257
Look. Hey. Come here.

14:42.341 --> 14:44.551
Is this--
Is this the suit that Ted got you?

14:45.135 --> 14:46.386
-What, this?
-Yeah.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.514
I can't remember--

14:48.597 --> 14:50.766
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.226
Yeah, it's-- Yeah.

14:52.309 --> 14:53.894
-Nice, it's really nice.
-Thank you.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.022
Another man buying you clothes
is infantilizing, yes?

15:00.526 --> 15:01.985
Fuck's sake.

15:02.986 --> 15:06.323
Well, no.
He doesn't buy all of my clothes.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.492
Most of them are gifts from my mum.
You know.

15:10.118 --> 15:11.453
Let's go.

15:16.834 --> 15:18.168
Is that a fucking apple?

15:18.252 --> 15:19.253
Yeah.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.880
I got it from a tree outside.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.841
Tastes like dead people.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.843
That's not funny, Roy.

15:25.926 --> 15:29.179
No, but it's surprisingly delicious.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.686
Cheer up, Keeley. It's a funeral.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.152
I hate dress shoes so much, Jamie.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.281
I know, muchacho.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.616
'Cause remember,
they ain't made for people like us.

15:50.284 --> 15:51.618
They're made for sheep.

15:52.703 --> 15:54.621
They're made for Muggles.

15:55.539 --> 15:56.832
They're made for twats.

15:56.915 --> 16:00.711
When I get home, I will set them on fire,
and their memory will burn in hell.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.296
Jesus, Dani.

16:03.463 --> 16:06.967
Jesús has no place in the conversation
of these damn shoes.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.254
How you feeling, Ted?

16:45.631 --> 16:46.757
I'm better, you know?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.175
Not great, but better.

16:48.967 --> 16:49.968
Good.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.431
Because when someone's not great,

16:54.515 --> 16:56.433
that allows me to get in there
and do my thing.

16:57.976 --> 16:58.977
Yeah.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.064
May I sit down?

17:02.147 --> 17:03.690
I wish the doctor would, yeah.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.534
You want something to drink?
A cup of tea or something?

17:13.617 --> 17:15.993
No, thank you. I hate tea.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.579
Tastes like a wet paper bag.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.794
I'll tell you anything.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.802
I don't think I've ever been
in a properly…

17:31.885 --> 17:34.721
Anglican house of worship before, and…

17:36.098 --> 17:38.976
it makes me miss you,
and I just wish you were here.

17:39.059 --> 17:41.770
Me too. I love funerals.

17:41.854 --> 17:43.188
Is it an open casket?

17:43.272 --> 17:45.524
God, I hope so. I like to see.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.317
Me too.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.532
Yeah, yeah. You know what?

17:55.158 --> 17:58.871
-You can't be serious.
-I'm dead serious!

18:00.038 --> 18:01.540
What? I mean it.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.293
When I was a kid, the only thing I liked
about church was confession.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.377
It was so freeing.

18:05.460 --> 18:08.046
I'd just sit there and admit
all the sickest shit inside of my brain.

18:09.464 --> 18:12.843
Oh, my God. One time, I made the priest
blush and barf at the same time.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.095
Yeah.

18:15.179 --> 18:18.390
I have been told to come in
to ask you to lower your voices.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.435
But I also brought this.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.229
-Oh, good work.
-Oh, nice.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.023
Stole it from a little boy
in a white robe.

18:26.106 --> 18:27.983
No, Sass.

18:28.066 --> 18:30.027
So, Stinky.

18:30.527 --> 18:33.864
-Who are you secretly shagging?
-What?

18:33.947 --> 18:36.241
Let's skip the part
where you pretend you're not, yeah?

18:36.992 --> 18:39.036
What are you even talking about?

18:39.620 --> 18:42.164
How about
the bullshit text after the date,

18:42.247 --> 18:44.958
the fact I have not seen you
outside of work for two weeks,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.794
and that even though today is
your father's funeral,

18:47.878 --> 18:50.047
you are glowing like a girl
that just got properly plowed.

18:50.714 --> 18:51.715
God.

18:53.926 --> 18:55.052
Shit.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.640
-I knew it! I knew it!
-Oh, my God! You're right!

18:59.723 --> 19:03.310
I've been asked to come in
and tell you to lower your voices.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.437
The vicar looked like he wanted to swear.

19:05.521 --> 19:06.813
Is everything all right?

19:06.897 --> 19:07.898
Yeah, of course.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.275
We're just trying to figure out
who Rebecca is shagging.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.652
Oh, I know.

19:12.569 --> 19:13.779
And it's good.

19:13.862 --> 19:14.947
Mother.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.115
Come on-- Hang on. Hang on.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.784
Okay, let's play 20 questions.

19:18.867 --> 19:21.995
-Yes! Yes.
-Oh, my-- This is thrilling.

19:22.079 --> 19:23.872
Is he tall?

19:24.957 --> 19:25.958
Yes.

19:26.542 --> 19:29.211
-Is it Sam?
-How the fuck did you know that?

19:29.920 --> 19:32.214
-Oh, my God! I fucking did!
-No!

19:34.341 --> 19:36.218
Excuse me for one moment, please.

19:37.177 --> 19:38.178
What?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.348
-I did!
-Oh, my God!

19:41.431 --> 19:42.558
That's it!

19:42.641 --> 19:43.725
Oh, my Go--

19:44.393 --> 19:46.895
Everyone out except immediate family,
please.

19:46.979 --> 19:48.480
You're so bad.

19:49.731 --> 19:51.108
You are.

19:54.486 --> 19:55.737
Sorry.

19:56.572 --> 19:59.074
Boss-ass bitch.

20:00.826 --> 20:02.119
Forgive me, Father.

20:04.413 --> 20:06.248
Sorry, it's terrible behavior.

20:12.129 --> 20:14.756
Ted, it's not surprising
that you had a panic attack.

20:15.841 --> 20:17.801
It's possible that going to this funeral

20:17.885 --> 20:20.554
would trigger memories of going to
your own father's funeral.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.016
Nope. Nope, nope.

20:24.099 --> 20:25.726
I didn't go to my dad's funeral.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.603
Okay, why not?

20:28.187 --> 20:29.438
'Cause he quit.

20:31.899 --> 20:33.317
You know, he quit on his family.

20:34.610 --> 20:35.986
He quit on himself.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.658
And I hated him for that.

20:45.412 --> 20:47.164
I think I still hate him for it.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.376
I think you do too, Ted.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.881
And that's okay.

20:56.798 --> 20:58.258
What happened with your father is

20:58.342 --> 21:01.136
a difficult thing
for anyone to make sense of,

21:01.220 --> 21:03.096
especially his teenage son.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.354
Do you agree?

21:13.732 --> 21:14.858
Yeah, okay.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.610
Okay, good.

21:17.945 --> 21:19.988
Why don't you share with me what happened?

21:31.875 --> 21:33.836
Do you know
what you're going to say in your eulogy?

21:35.254 --> 21:36.630
I don't want to do a eulogy.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.840
Rebecca.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.468
It would look awful if you didn't say
anything at your own father's funeral.

21:41.552 --> 21:42.719
I don't care.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.138
I've got nothing nice to say.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.473
What's got into you?

21:46.557 --> 21:49.935
He was a good father, a wonderful husband.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.437
Was he?

21:53.105 --> 21:54.356
What are you so angry about?

21:54.940 --> 21:57.985
I don't want to talk about it. Not today.

21:58.068 --> 21:59.987
Stop behaving like a child.

22:00.612 --> 22:02.322
Fine, you really want to know?

22:02.406 --> 22:05.534
Because I am so sick of keeping secrets.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.206
Dad cheated on you, and I saw it.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.419
When you were away,

22:15.502 --> 22:18.297
and I was meant
to be staying the night with Sassy.

22:19.214 --> 22:22.050
I even remember the date.
It was Friday the 13th, 199--

22:22.134 --> 22:23.635
…one, in September.

22:25.012 --> 22:27.806
I remember the date 'cause me
and a bunch of high school buddies

22:27.890 --> 22:31.351
were gonna do a marathon
of all them Jason movies that night.

22:33.770 --> 22:36.607
So I, you know,
came home from school as usual

22:37.566 --> 22:40.360
and went up to my room to…

22:40.444 --> 22:42.696
…nick a bottle of wine
from your drinks cabinet,

22:43.697 --> 22:45.699
and as we opened the door,

22:45.782 --> 22:46.783
I heard--

22:46.867 --> 22:47.993
Bang!

22:49.077 --> 22:51.246
So we went to investigate.

22:52.206 --> 22:54.124
I opened up the door, and…

22:56.877 --> 22:58.045
there he was.

22:58.670 --> 23:05.260
In all his glory with his arse in the air
with Mrs. Reynolds screaming his name.

23:09.681 --> 23:12.059
And Sassy didn't say anything

23:12.142 --> 23:14.019
for the first time in her life,
and I just--

23:14.102 --> 23:17.231
Screamed and choked. Cried.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.691
And he came running after me
in his dressing gown,

23:19.775 --> 23:21.276
begging me to stop, but I just--

23:21.360 --> 23:22.861
Ran upstairs, called 911.

23:24.821 --> 23:28.116
Went to the fridge,
grabbed one of his Coors Lights.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.451
Drank that.

23:31.537 --> 23:34.873
Then I called my mom at work
and let her know she needed to come home.

23:37.626 --> 23:39.628
And the next day, when I came back,

23:39.711 --> 23:42.422
he said nothing about it.

23:43.757 --> 23:47.594
And that is why I'm so fucking angry,
okay?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.182
It's why I've always hated him.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.480
And I still hate him.

24:00.816 --> 24:01.859
I know.

24:01.942 --> 24:03.694
No, you don't know how I feel.

24:03.777 --> 24:07.948
I mean, I know about his cheating.

24:09.283 --> 24:10.450
All of it.

24:11.118 --> 24:12.744
You knew, and you did nothing?

24:12.828 --> 24:15.038
Of course I knew. I know everything.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.375
Then I hate you too.

24:22.504 --> 24:24.840
I hate you
for letting him treat you like that.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.803
I'm sorry that happened to you, Ted.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.680
Yeah, me too.

24:33.098 --> 24:35.225
And I understand
why you're angry with him.

24:36.935 --> 24:38.437
He took a lot away from you.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.730
And my mom.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.524
And your mum, yes.

24:44.568 --> 24:45.986
I'm curious about something.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.822
What was he like?

24:50.532 --> 24:52.117
He was a good man, you know.

24:53.577 --> 24:55.412
Real chatterbox, believe it or not.

24:57.331 --> 25:01.210
Probably could have been a little bit
better listening box at times.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.131
What did you love about him?

25:10.969 --> 25:12.262
Why?

25:12.346 --> 25:14.223
You told me what you hate about him.

25:14.723 --> 25:18.101
I'd love to hear something
you remember that made you feel good.

25:32.491 --> 25:35.911
When I was in fifth or sixth grade,
there was this book called Johnny Tremain,

25:36.620 --> 25:39.498
and our homework for,
like, a month was to read this book.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.878
At the end of the month,
I hadn't read a lick of it, you know.

25:46.255 --> 25:48.257
And we had a test,

25:48.340 --> 25:49.716
big test, like, the next day.

25:50.259 --> 25:52.511
And the night before,
I was anxious as all heck,

25:52.594 --> 25:53.637
and I couldn't sleep,

25:53.720 --> 25:55.722
and my dad starts
getting after me about that.

25:56.473 --> 25:57.891
And I start crying.

25:57.975 --> 26:00.143
And he's like, "Whoa, buddy.
What's wrong? What's wrong?"

26:00.227 --> 26:01.478
And I tell him what's up.

26:02.646 --> 26:04.481
And he says,
"Hey, don't worry about it, okay.

26:04.565 --> 26:06.692
Just go up to your room,
lay your head on your pillow

26:06.775 --> 26:09.236
and think about
something you're looking forward to."

26:09.319 --> 26:10.571
So that's what I did.

26:11.446 --> 26:13.031
Next morning, I wake up,
and he says, "Hey,

26:13.115 --> 26:15.492
you ain't gonna ride your bike to school.
I'm gonna drive you."

26:15.576 --> 26:16.827
And I'm like, "All right."

26:17.995 --> 26:21.874
And on the way to school,
he talks me through the entire book,

26:22.583 --> 26:24.877
like it's a bedtime story or something.

26:26.086 --> 26:28.505
'Cause he stayed up all night,
the whole night,

26:29.506 --> 26:30.966
reading the whole damn thing,

26:31.633 --> 26:35.846
'cause he didn't want his little boy
stressed out over some stupid, silly test.

26:37.264 --> 26:39.349
And I ended up getting an A.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.642
Boom.

26:45.314 --> 26:46.565
He was a good dad.

26:50.903 --> 26:52.654
And I don't think he knew that.

26:58.076 --> 27:00.871
I think if he would've known
how good he was

27:00.954 --> 27:03.707
at stuff he didn't really care about
being good at, he--

27:04.666 --> 27:06.418
I don't think he would've done what he--

27:10.005 --> 27:11.381
And I wish I would've told him.

27:11.465 --> 27:13.300
I wish I would've told him more.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.389
I was just so angry at him.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.392
'Cause he was always going to work

27:22.476 --> 27:24.311
and just out with friends
or something like that,

27:24.394 --> 27:25.729
and then he was gone.

27:31.235 --> 27:34.154
And I knew right then and there that
I was never gonna let anybody get by me

27:34.238 --> 27:37.241
without understanding
they might be hurting inside, you know.

27:39.034 --> 27:40.410
'Cause life, it's hard.

27:44.164 --> 27:45.165
It's real hard.

27:50.879 --> 27:52.172
Thank you, Ted.

27:57.678 --> 27:59.972
I don't know
if this is illegal or something,

28:00.055 --> 28:01.098
but can I have a hug?

28:01.682 --> 28:02.683
Sure.

28:09.398 --> 28:10.774
It's okay.

28:11.358 --> 28:13.068
Are you going to charge me
for this session?

28:14.319 --> 28:15.320
Of course I am.

28:15.404 --> 28:17.197
-Okay.
-For the house call.

28:17.281 --> 28:18.615
I appreciate your integrity.

28:19.199 --> 28:20.576
You're welcome.

28:26.123 --> 28:27.291
I'm sorry, Rebecca, but--

28:29.918 --> 28:31.211
I'm not as strong as you.

28:32.713 --> 28:35.132
I was too scared to leave him for good.

28:35.215 --> 28:37.843
You don't think
I was scared leaving Rupert?

28:39.011 --> 28:40.470
I was terrified.

28:41.013 --> 28:43.640
And rightly so because let me tell you,
being alone

28:44.391 --> 28:45.976
is fucking horrible.

28:48.478 --> 28:50.147
But it's been necessary.

28:54.943 --> 28:57.613
'Cause it's actually started
to feel rather wonderful.

29:00.365 --> 29:01.617
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

29:04.286 --> 29:06.663
Besides, Rupert was a self-righteous shit.

29:07.414 --> 29:09.166
Then why are you always so nice to him?

29:09.249 --> 29:11.877
Because, my darling,
the best way to deal with people like that

29:11.960 --> 29:14.379
is to make sure
they know they can't get to you.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.549
Anyway, when all's said and done,

29:18.300 --> 29:21.970
what's more important,
being loving or being right?

29:24.056 --> 29:26.350
I was so proud of you when you left him.

29:27.601 --> 29:29.186
You knew you deserved better.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.024
Now, I've got a whole lot of baggage,

29:34.900 --> 29:37.277
but when I love something,
I love it forever.

29:37.361 --> 29:38.779
And I loved your father.

29:40.155 --> 29:41.782
Even though he treated you like that?

29:41.865 --> 29:42.866
Yeah.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.994
He wasn't perfect.
I didn't need him to be.

29:46.078 --> 29:47.079
He always came back.

29:51.083 --> 29:53.502
You know, I'm actually glad
to hear that you hate me.

29:54.962 --> 29:58.882
All these years, I've thought
you didn't feel anything for me.

30:00.884 --> 30:03.595
I'll take your anger
over your indifference any day.

30:08.308 --> 30:09.309
It's time.

30:09.977 --> 30:12.479
And thank you
for keeping your voices down.

30:18.652 --> 30:19.653
Come on, then.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.499
Let us pray.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.461
Our Father…

30:36.545 --> 30:40.549
…who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.

30:41.175 --> 30:45.679
Amazing grace

30:45.762 --> 30:49.099
How sweet the sound

30:49.183 --> 30:50.601
"The Lord is my shepherd.

30:51.185 --> 30:53.270
There is nothing I shall want.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.899
Fresh and green are the pastures."

30:56.982 --> 30:58.192
Thank you.

31:00.277 --> 31:03.655
Now, normally I would have to fib

31:03.739 --> 31:06.200
about how well I knew the deceased.

31:06.742 --> 31:09.995
But in this case,
I did know Paul very well.

31:10.996 --> 31:13.498
He came to church every weekend,

31:14.124 --> 31:15.792
sitting right over there,

31:16.502 --> 31:20.255
paying attention to every single word

31:20.923 --> 31:23.759
of the Richmond match
he was listening to on his phone.

31:26.845 --> 31:29.515
-But I would never have felt the need…
-…mother of Jesus Christ.

31:29.598 --> 31:31.517
…to chide Paul about this.

31:31.600 --> 31:34.186
-It was a sign of his passion…
-Oh, my God.

31:34.269 --> 31:36.438
…for his beloved sport

31:36.522 --> 31:40.025
and the commitment he showed to his team.

31:41.735 --> 31:44.488
They're the same passion and commitment

31:45.072 --> 31:48.951
which he showed both as a husband
and a father

31:49.535 --> 31:51.578
to his family as well.

31:54.540 --> 31:59.920
And now we will hear a eulogy
from Paul's daughter, Rebecca.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.136
Bye-bye.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.646
I don't really know what to say.

32:48.635 --> 32:49.803
My father…

32:51.597 --> 32:53.140
was…

33:03.317 --> 33:05.068
We're no strangers to love.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.697
You know the rules…

33:11.617 --> 33:13.744
And so do I

33:15.495 --> 33:19.625
A full commitment's
What I'm thinking of

33:21.335 --> 33:25.714
You wouldn't get this
From any other guy

33:31.386 --> 33:32.596
I…

33:34.014 --> 33:37.434
Just want to tell you how I'm feeling

33:38.977 --> 33:42.397
Try to make you understand

33:44.107 --> 33:47.277
Never gonna give you up

33:48.237 --> 33:50.864
Never gonna let you down

33:53.075 --> 33:56.119
Never gonna run around

33:57.287 --> 33:59.748
And desert you

34:02.209 --> 34:05.087
Never gonna make you cry

34:07.256 --> 34:09.341
Never gonna say…

34:18.891 --> 34:21.228
Never gonna say goodbye

34:25.232 --> 34:29.570
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

34:30.737 --> 34:33.114
Never gonna give you up

34:33.197 --> 34:36.076
Never gonna let you down

34:36.159 --> 34:41.248
Never gonna run around and desert you

34:41.331 --> 34:43.876
Never gonna make you cry

34:43.958 --> 34:46.587
Never gonna say goodbye

34:46.670 --> 34:51.425
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

34:52.676 --> 34:54.928
Never gonna give, never gonna give

34:55.012 --> 34:57.014
Give you up

34:58.182 --> 34:59.683
Never gonna give, never gonna give

34:59.766 --> 35:01.810
Give you up

35:04.646 --> 35:05.814
Thank you.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.075
Rupert, thank you so much for coming.

35:17.159 --> 35:19.244
Dad would've loved you being here.

35:19.828 --> 35:21.705
Do you want to pop by at the house, Rupie?

35:21.788 --> 35:23.040
We're having some people over,

35:23.123 --> 35:26.502
and I know Rebecca would hate me
if I didn't invite you.

35:28.795 --> 35:31.215
Thank you, both--

35:31.882 --> 35:33.800
Well, I'm afraid we have to go.

35:34.384 --> 35:35.469
It's nap time.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.721
For you or the baby? Boom!

35:39.723 --> 35:41.517
Yeah, for mother and child, actually.

35:41.600 --> 35:44.228
Yeah, she won't sleep in the crib
unless I'm in there with her.

35:44.311 --> 35:46.396
-Oh, won't she?
-So sweet.

35:46.480 --> 35:47.773
Take care.

35:51.235 --> 35:52.694
Rebecca, I meant to say.

35:54.404 --> 35:56.782
I've convinced Bex to give up
her shares in Richmond.

35:56.865 --> 36:00.327
I mean, there's just no time
for footie these days.

36:00.410 --> 36:02.663
So, we'd love you to have them.

36:04.122 --> 36:06.250
Like a funeral present?

36:07.209 --> 36:09.378
I think that's
very thoughtful of you, Rupie.

36:09.461 --> 36:11.672
Yes, yes. Thank you so much, Rupert.

36:32.568 --> 36:34.945
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yes.

36:36.864 --> 36:38.782
I think I need to break it off with Sam.

36:38.866 --> 36:40.200
-What?
-Why?

36:40.284 --> 36:42.244
-It's not the age thing, right?
-No. I'm--

36:42.327 --> 36:43.412
I'm not even sure I--

36:43.495 --> 36:46.164
-Wait, are you worried about press stuff?
-Maybe.

36:46.248 --> 36:47.791
I know.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.168
Penis is too big.

36:49.251 --> 36:50.711
Hurts your tiny little vagina.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.921
Yes, that's it.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.301
…make sure they got air in 'em.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.802
Speaking of which.

37:04.433 --> 37:05.851
-Hey.
-Hi.

37:05.934 --> 37:07.561
Me and Billy were just going over here…

37:07.644 --> 37:09.188
-Okay.
-…to talk about 1966.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.274
How you doing?

37:15.819 --> 37:17.654
There he is.

37:17.738 --> 37:19.740
Right, wish me luck.

37:20.449 --> 37:22.117
You got this.

37:22.201 --> 37:23.535
It'll be all right.

37:23.619 --> 37:25.704
Be gentle though, yeah?

37:27.247 --> 37:29.541
Oh, God, he's smiling.
I hate to see him like this.

37:33.670 --> 37:37.633
Rebecca, muchísimas gracias.
I can feel my toes again.

37:41.845 --> 37:44.014
I am so happy we wear the same size.

37:44.765 --> 37:46.517
Good. Me too.

37:46.600 --> 37:47.809
You keep those.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.062
Your generosity knows no boundaries.

38:08.539 --> 38:10.541
Hi, Jamie. Do you want a drink?

38:11.708 --> 38:13.293
Don't really know where to start,
to be honest.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.170
I'm a bit all over the place.

38:15.754 --> 38:17.172
You wanna start with a beer?

38:18.924 --> 38:21.218
No, thank you. Listen, Keeley.

38:22.886 --> 38:25.305
I know that you're with Roy
and that you're happy,

38:25.389 --> 38:28.725
but today's made me realize that
I'd hate myself if I didn't say…

38:30.769 --> 38:34.565
I didn't just come back to Richmond
to get away from my dad.

38:34.648 --> 38:36.942
I also came back 'cause of you.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.949
I finally think that I'm becoming
the best version of myself,

38:44.032 --> 38:46.118
the kind of man
that you always knew that I could be.

38:48.912 --> 38:53.834
And I know that this is
a mad, shitty thing to do, but…

38:57.087 --> 38:59.506
I love you, Keeley.

39:05.512 --> 39:06.597
Sorry.

39:14.104 --> 39:15.314
Oi.

39:17.149 --> 39:20.819
Listen, I was a prick today,
making dumb fucking jokes.

39:20.903 --> 39:23.739
It's, just, death makes me uncomfortable

39:24.364 --> 39:25.782
'cause when my granddad died,

39:25.866 --> 39:29.995
I spent every single night
for a whole year praying

39:30.078 --> 39:33.624
that I could just talk to him just once,
or see him just one more time

39:33.707 --> 39:35.959
like he was Obi-Wan Kenobi or some shit.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.878
And I got fuck all.

39:39.713 --> 39:41.381
But it did make me realize,

39:42.758 --> 39:44.551
we only got this one life,

39:46.220 --> 39:48.013
and I don't wanna waste a second of it.

39:50.098 --> 39:51.225
I love you, Keeley.

39:52.476 --> 39:53.560
I'm sorry.

40:07.449 --> 40:08.450
Sorry.

40:10.369 --> 40:13.914
I've wanted to do this all day,
but I haven't had the chance.

40:31.598 --> 40:32.599
Sam,

40:33.433 --> 40:36.770
you're so kind and loving

40:36.854 --> 40:39.231
and… wise.

40:42.276 --> 40:43.652
-But--
-Oh, no.

40:44.444 --> 40:46.154
I hate big buts, and I cannot lie.

40:46.655 --> 40:50.534
There's just this one issue that--

40:52.327 --> 40:55.080
There's just one thing I can't get past.

40:55.163 --> 40:56.415
What is it?

40:57.124 --> 40:58.250
You're wonderful.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.711
Why is that a bad thing?

41:00.794 --> 41:04.089
Because you could really hurt me.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.717
But you can hurt me too.

41:07.301 --> 41:08.719
Well, doesn't that scare you?

41:08.802 --> 41:09.970
No.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.682
-Does it scare you?
-Yes.

41:17.603 --> 41:20.856
And I think I need to figure out why.

41:23.775 --> 41:24.860
On my own.

41:31.783 --> 41:33.035
I understand.

41:34.411 --> 41:35.704
Take as long as you need.

41:37.664 --> 41:38.665
It's okay.

41:41.585 --> 41:42.794
Thank you.

41:46.048 --> 41:49.384
But, Rebecca,
there's something I should warn you of.

41:50.010 --> 41:51.053
Yes?

41:51.637 --> 41:53.263
I'm only gonna get more wonderful.

41:56.099 --> 41:57.309
I know.

42:14.368 --> 42:17.955
-Food was amazing. Thank you very much.
-Thank you for coming, Thierry.

42:18.038 --> 42:19.039
Yeah.

42:19.122 --> 42:20.832
-Bye, Isaac.
-Thanks, Isaac.

42:20.916 --> 42:22.042
Ladies.

42:24.461 --> 42:25.671
Sorry for your loss, ladies.

42:25.754 --> 42:27.130
Don't be, Ted.

42:27.214 --> 42:28.549
You didn't kill him, did you?

42:28.632 --> 42:29.758
Mum.

42:29.842 --> 42:32.427
Well, I'm sorry that I was late today.
How about that?

42:32.511 --> 42:34.179
Yeah, is everything okay?

42:34.263 --> 42:35.722
Everything? Heck, no. No.

42:35.806 --> 42:37.099
But me? Yeah, I'm doing okay.

42:37.182 --> 42:38.308
-Okay.
-Yeah.

42:39.059 --> 42:41.854
And, hey, I know I only got to meet
Mr. Welton that one time,

42:41.937 --> 42:45.566
but, well, the fact that
a fella his age could still do every move

42:45.649 --> 42:48.277
from Donald O'Connor's big old dance scene
from Singin' in the Rain,

42:49.278 --> 42:51.864
it just gave me a lot of hope
for getting older, you know.

42:51.947 --> 42:53.949
Paul loved two things:

42:54.032 --> 42:57.578
attention and making her laugh.

42:59.913 --> 43:01.707
You know, I'd forgotten that.
Thank you, Ted.

43:02.499 --> 43:04.084
Well, good night.

43:05.544 --> 43:06.587
Shall we?

43:09.673 --> 43:12.384
Florence does like wounded birds,
doesn't she?

43:14.178 --> 43:15.179
Let's go this way.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.389
Yes, she does.

43:21.727 --> 43:22.936
…they're great, bro.

43:27.399 --> 43:29.151
You and Sam taking a break?

43:33.238 --> 43:34.740
How did you know that?

43:35.324 --> 43:37.075
I'm your mother. I know everything.

43:37.910 --> 43:41.038
Besides, I saw him coming
out of the cupboard looking sad.

43:45.083 --> 43:46.084
Right.

43:46.877 --> 43:48.212
Drink, please.

43:48.295 --> 43:49.505
Come on, then.

43:57.346 --> 44:00.015
Look. You look like a little boy there.

44:00.516 --> 44:01.850
Well, you cut my hair.

44:01.934 --> 44:03.477
Yeah, I always wanted a boy.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.689
-What else have we got in here?
-Look how long my hair was.

44:10.317 --> 44:12.736
-Home videos.
-I've probably taped over that.

44:12.819 --> 44:14.696
I bloody well hope you haven't.

44:14.780 --> 44:17.324
Look at your cheekbones there. My gosh.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.788
Why am I sitting in a bowl?

44:23.956 --> 44:25.832
No, you made that our pool.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.794
All the other neighborhood kids
who had pools,

44:28.877 --> 44:31.630
they'd come specially over
so they could swim in your bowl.

44:31.713 --> 44:34.466
-It's a good bowl.
-It is.

44:36.677 --> 44:38.971
-You're still my little girl.
-Oh, Mother.

44:39.054 --> 44:40.597
You are my little girl.

44:51.900 --> 44:54.695
I think you had
a bit of a thing for Rick Astley, Mother.

44:54.778 --> 44:57.531
Well, maybe I did.
But that's not him, is it?

44:57.614 --> 44:58.615
Yeah, of course it is.

45:02.077 --> 45:03.328
No, I thought he was Black.

45:05.330 --> 45:06.540
That's Rick Astley?

45:06.623 --> 45:07.624
Yes.
