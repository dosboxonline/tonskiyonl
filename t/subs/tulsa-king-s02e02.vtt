stole the catalytic converters

of course.

The police have bigger fish
to fry.

29:39.690 --> 29:40.996
But do you have insurance?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.606
Yes, but even so,

29:42.606 --> 29:44.217
it'll take weeks to restock

29:44.217 --> 29:45.871
and replace the missing
converters.

29:45.871 --> 29:48.656
Now, I can't have this
happen again. I'll go broke.

for protection,

30:00.059 --> 30:04.237

and my sister a new car.

30:04.237 --> 30:07.414

- Exactly.

some of them back,
