09:21.436 --> 09:23.146
So, how the hell do you pour
foundation wrong, anyway?

09:23.229 --> 09:24.564
-NICKY: It happens. Relax.
-Yeah?

09:24.647 --> 09:26.399
Hey, uh, either one
of you seen Cassidy?

09:26.483 --> 09:27.609
GROSS:
In the back.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.319
By the Bobcat.

09:33.448 --> 09:34.699
KEVIN:
Hey!

09:36.326 --> 09:39.120
-What the hell happened?
-CASSIDY: Oh, good
to see you, too.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.081
I know, Matty's getting so big.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.083
It's just crazy,
time just flies.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.834
-How was your flight?
-Cassidy.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.337
Hey.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.922
(engine stops)

09:49.005 --> 09:50.757
We had a little setback.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.592
A little setback... Oh, you
know, when I asked you to hire

09:52.676 --> 09:54.552
a couple of workers, I meant
real construction workers.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.221
You know? Not just some
clowns off the street.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.098
Yeah, they're not clowns,
they're vets.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.474
Yeah, who've done
a lot harder jobs

09:59.557 --> 10:01.726
than building cabins
with bidets for movie stars.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.977
-(laughs)
-What?

10:03.061 --> 10:04.979
Sorry, you just called Kevin
a movie star.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.064
(laughs)

10:06.147 --> 10:07.732
CASSIDY:
Your architect's scales

10:07.816 --> 10:09.734
were incorrect
for the back room,

10:09.818 --> 10:11.361
but I should have caught it
before we started to pour.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.405
-It's my bad.
-Yeah, obviously.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.281
-Oh, come on, cool it.
-I am cool.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.950
Just what-what is this?
What am I looking at?

10:17.033 --> 10:18.993
-Does this set us back
a week, a month?
-CASSIDY: Hey.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.870
You don't pay me enough
to take this crap.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.831
I need to get back to work.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.837
-The hell's her problem?
-Her problem?

10:28.920 --> 10:31.631
Oh, I don't know. Kid's not
taking the divorce well,

10:31.715 --> 10:34.676
I hear her pacing the halls
at night when she crashes here.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.594
And she devoted
her adult life to a war

10:36.678 --> 10:38.805
that just ended
with an apology and a fart.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
So, you know,
that kind of stuff.

10:41.224 --> 10:42.976
She's busting her ass
for you, kid.

10:43.059 --> 10:45.395
-We're all busting our ass here.
-I know.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.396
I know.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.814
And you're right. I'm sorry.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.190
It's just...

10:49.274 --> 10:51.484
I'm sort of a stressed-out
parent myself, you know?

10:51.568 --> 10:53.403
No, no, you're an idiot.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.780
I mean, why-why didn't
you just fly Mary Poppins

10:55.864 --> 10:57.907
out here on, you know,
one of your Learjets?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.869
-No, because I can do this.
-(stifled laugh)

11:02.996 --> 11:05.040
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.584

I thought you were being cute.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.064
You want to go...
I'll go that way.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.149
Can't imagine why you two
didn't work out.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.817
Uh-huh.

11:34.027 --> 11:37.655
Hey, listen, um,
I just wanted to say...

11:37.739 --> 11:41.409
I'm sorry about,
you know, being a dick earlier.

11:42.619 --> 11:45.497
Uh, you mean, like, an hour ago,
or, like, since I met you?

11:45.580 --> 11:47.040
Like, an hour ago.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.419
Mm. Sorry for
the foundation screwup.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.088
Is that "sorry for
the foundation screwup"

11:53.171 --> 11:55.382
or "sorry for the foundation,
Screwup"?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.092
Can it be both?

12:01.805 --> 12:03.139
(clears throat)

12:03.223 --> 12:04.432
Oh, can I sit there?

12:04.516 --> 12:06.685
You want to sit here?
Yeah, sure.

12:06.768 --> 12:09.771
All right. You know
what I think we need to do?

12:09.854 --> 12:11.690

Yes. She's in with

19:07.272 --> 19:08.189
Take a seat over there.

19:08.273 --> 19:09.399
When the doctors
are done with her,

19:09.482 --> 19:10.817
they'll come out to you.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.236
Uh, we were told that
she's conscious and talking?

19:13.319 --> 19:16.448
A seat. Over there.

19:16.531 --> 19:17.699
Thanks.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.452
This whole thing
could be my fault.

19:20.535 --> 19:21.661
-What?
-I mean, the way

19:21.745 --> 19:23.288
I jumped all over her
about the jackhammering.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.956
You know,
I'm an addict myself, I...

19:25.040 --> 19:26.082
should have known
better than that.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.668
Maybe she, you know,
couldn't sleep

19:28.752 --> 19:32.255
and caved in, had a few drinks,
got behind the wheel.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.923
Yeah, you give yourself
too much credit.

19:35.383 --> 19:37.385
Here.

19:37.469 --> 19:38.887
You're friends of the patient
Cassidy Sharp?

19:38.970 --> 19:41.181
-Yeah, how is she?
-She's resting now.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.891
Though uncomfortably.
She refused any painkillers,

19:42.974 --> 19:44.100
except Tylenol.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.227
Well, yeah,
she's a recovering addict.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.355
Yeah, sh-she made that clear.

19:48.438 --> 19:50.023
And there was
no alcohol involved?

19:50.106 --> 19:51.983
No, none in her system.
She's gonna be okay.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.277
She suffered a fractured
clavicle and broken arm.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.237
The humerus bone.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.906
Maybe she went to get ice cream.

19:57.989 --> 19:58.990
You know?
It's late, nothing's open.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.284
She got tired and she...

20:01.368 --> 20:02.577
She's gonna be okay, though?

20:02.660 --> 20:04.204
Yes. Yes.
From what I understand,

20:04.287 --> 20:07.123
the pole took the worst of it.
It was a direct hit.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.167
But we're gonna keep an eye
on her overnight, maybe two.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.585
She's sleeping now.

20:10.669 --> 20:12.212
And given that she didn't
want a pain sedative,

20:12.295 --> 20:14.547
that sleep's gonna be
very important to her.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.633
And her doctor.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.927
So I suggest you come back
in the morning, okay?

20:19.010 --> 20:20.595
-KEVIN: Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.180
Very much.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.767
-Thank God.
-Yeah.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.695
Look, a broken arm,
broken clavicle,

20:36.778 --> 20:38.488
it's not like it's nothing,
but she's sober.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.865
And she's refusing
her pain medications,

20:40.949 --> 20:42.534
so that's good, right?

20:45.537 --> 20:47.539
Lighten up.
She's gonna be all right.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.750
"Lighten up," he says.

20:52.168 --> 20:54.838
Do you know what she did
in Afghanistan?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.925
Human intelligence. That means

20:59.009 --> 21:01.928
every day
that she went out in the field,

21:02.012 --> 21:05.056
she'd visit, uh,
some poor villager's house,

21:05.140 --> 21:08.685
and she'd say,
"As long as you help us,

21:08.768 --> 21:10.937
"we will protect you.

21:11.021 --> 21:12.439
We will get you
out of the country."

21:14.858 --> 21:17.318
Sometimes she even meant it.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.362
But even if she didn't,

21:19.446 --> 21:21.573
that's the job.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.616
Um... you sell it.

21:24.701 --> 21:27.787
-She-she didn't seem
that off to me, honestly.
-Oh,

21:27.871 --> 21:29.789
that's right. I forgot.
You went to Vietnam.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.583
You got yourself
a little necklace, right?

21:31.666 --> 21:33.418
Yeah, you're the expert.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.378
Look, people like Cassidy,

21:35.462 --> 21:38.465
they don't give you a heads-up
when they're not okay.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.967
You find out the hard way.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.635
You understand?

21:45.138 --> 21:49.100
At dinner, she didn't sit
with her back to the door.

21:49.184 --> 21:50.685
Now, I've seen that before.

21:50.769 --> 21:53.772
I've <i>been</i> that before.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.817
You don't just...

21:57.901 --> 21:59.986
get better.

22:00.070 --> 22:02.447
And if you think
I'm exaggerating,

22:02.530 --> 22:05.200
let me remind you
that your father

22:05.283 --> 22:07.660
drank in secret
trying to forget.

22:08.745 --> 22:11.498
Let me remind you
when you busted into my trailer,

22:11.581 --> 22:14.000
there was a gun
sitting in front of me.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.588
That was 50 years
after boots left Vietnam.

22:23.635 --> 22:25.595
(exhales)
Look, let's just go.

22:25.679 --> 22:28.264
I mean, you heard the doctor.
We'll go out, we'll come back

22:28.348 --> 22:30.809
-fresh and early.
-Whoa, whoa, I... It's...
You know, maybe...

22:30.892 --> 22:33.228
Should one of us stay?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.647
You want to stay?

22:35.730 --> 22:38.650
-Me?
-Well, you're her friend,

22:38.733 --> 22:40.235
-right?
-Yeah.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.529
Course. I just...

22:42.612 --> 22:44.698
I understand
it's the right thing to do.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.200
I just... I don't know if I'm...

22:47.283 --> 22:50.995
if I'm the right guy
to-to do it.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.127
Don't try to help her,
all right?

22:57.210 --> 23:00.755
Okay? You-you just being here,
that's enough.

23:00.839 --> 23:03.800
Just do nothing. Just...

23:03.883 --> 23:05.802
Just be.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.304
Just be.

Yeah. No, I'll-I'll go tell
him... I'll go tell him now.

35:06.690 --> 35:09.234
Okay. See you in a bit.

35:09.317 --> 35:11.528
(guitar strumming)

35:13.613 --> 35:16.116
All right. Look at you.
You're sounding great.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.036
So, I just got off the phone
with your dad.

35:20.120 --> 35:22.664
He said he's gonna come by
and pick you up.

35:22.747 --> 35:24.290
I think you're gonna go
by the hospital

35:24.374 --> 35:26.459
to visit your mom
on your way out of town, okay?

35:26.543 --> 35:29.796
Your dad said it's cool.
Said he wants to see her, too.

35:29.879 --> 35:32.215
Does she look bad?

35:32.298 --> 35:34.342
Your mom? No.

35:34.426 --> 35:37.053
No, your mom...
your mom could never look bad.

35:37.137 --> 35:40.056
And it's gonna take more than a
fender bender to keep her down.

35:40.140 --> 35:43.101
But I think it would
cheer her up to see you.

35:47.856 --> 35:50.817
You know, when I was
at the hospital last night,

35:50.900 --> 35:52.110
I was visiting your mom.

35:53.194 --> 35:55.196
And I was gonna buy her
a get-well card,

35:55.280 --> 35:56.906
but everything they had
was kind of lame.

35:56.990 --> 35:58.533
You know? It was cheesy.

35:58.616 --> 36:02.412
So, I was thinking
maybe you and I

36:02.495 --> 36:04.330
work together, and we build her
a card of our own.

36:04.414 --> 36:06.499
What do you think
about that? Hmm?

36:06.583 --> 36:07.834
All right.

36:07.917 --> 36:10.587
But I'm no good at painting.

36:10.670 --> 36:13.256
Oh, no, it doesn't matter.
You don't have to be good.

36:13.340 --> 36:15.592
You know,
when I first started acting,

36:15.675 --> 36:18.553
every time I got a new role,
I would paint.

36:18.636 --> 36:21.056
I would go buy a bunch of paint
and just-just have at it.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.599
Freed up my mind.

36:22.682 --> 36:24.726
But, uh, you know,

36:24.809 --> 36:27.979
then I got self-conscious,
and I quit.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.774
Picked up other hobbies,
like the guitar.

36:34.569 --> 36:36.071

36:45.663 --> 36:47.957

-Yeah.

36:48.041 --> 36:49.709
-Get some green.
-Green. Green and blue.

36:49.793 --> 36:51.503
-Let's do them both. Yeah.
-Yeah.

37:34.254 --> 37:36.047
Oh, no, you're not.
You're just a little dirty.

37:36.131 --> 37:37.298
But, you know,
you're working construction,

37:37.382 --> 37:40.385
so it's to be... figured.
It was a joke.

37:40.468 --> 37:42.512
-Cute.
-KEVIN: Thanks.

37:42.595 --> 37:45.140
After the inspection, we'll
start framing by end of week.

37:45.223 --> 37:46.433
-Great.
-GROSS: Good.

38:10.832 --> 38:13.460
No, you haven't.

38:13.543 --> 38:15.045
I spoke to the VA.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.921
They have a specialist,

38:17.005 --> 38:20.633
a readjustment counselor
that you can speak to.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.302
She's good.

38:22.385 --> 38:24.220

38:32.729 --> 38:35.565
Your grandpa used to love
sitting up here.

38:35.648 --> 38:38.193
He'd sit out here,
taking in the world, you know?

38:42.072 --> 38:43.406
You know your cousin
was named after him?

38:43.490 --> 38:46.159
Did you know that? Huh?
Can you say "Jack"?

38:46.242 --> 38:47.911
Can you say "Jack"?

38:47.994 --> 38:50.622
Anyway, for your grandfather,

38:50.705 --> 38:53.583
having the tough childhood
that he... that he did,

38:53.667 --> 38:57.712
