greasy food to unhappy people,

we can do today.

for a delicious brunch
at the Fairmont.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.608

we could go to this cool

to understand art.
-I do.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.242
For ten minutes at a time,
of course.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.703
Yeah, anything longer
just, like, defeats the purpose.

16:34.786 --> 16:36.913

-So, what do you say?

17:09.571 --> 17:12.240

no fancy plans or pressure.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.300
We could just go out
and see where the day takes us.

Oh. Um... Okay.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.014
Sure. Yeah.

Well, if that's what you want to
do, then that's what we'll do.

Really, babe? 'Cause I know
that you worked so hard.

-No, listen to me.

that matters, okay?

17:46.149 --> 17:49.569

and you know well and good

17:49.652 --> 17:51.988

Wait, let me guess.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.242
Is this the neighborhood
where they filmed

19:19.325 --> 19:20.535
<i>So I Married an Axe Murderer?</i>

19:20.618 --> 19:22.912
"Look at the size

19:22.996 --> 19:25.165

19:25.248 --> 19:27.834
-(both laugh)
-N-Not quite.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.586
-Oh.
-I-I wanted you...

19:29.669 --> 19:32.422
-Uh-huh.
-...to see this.

19:36.051 --> 19:39.429
We haven't really mentioned
the elephant in the room,

19:39.512 --> 19:43.391
and I think it's time that we
at least start talking about it.

19:43.475 --> 19:45.018
I miss you.

19:45.101 --> 19:48.772
I miss the kids, and I think,
I think that this would be

19:48.855 --> 19:50.398
perfect for us.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.193
To... buy?

19:53.276 --> 19:56.321
To think about,
if you're willing.

19:59.741 --> 20:00.992
Can I show you?

20:03.078 --> 20:04.537
Come on.

20:04.621 --> 20:08.041
There's three bedrooms upstairs,
each with their own bathroom.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.542
And don't forget
the converted ADU

20:09.626 --> 20:10.919
off the garage for grandma.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.004
-Good to see you, Toby.
-TOBY: How are you, Larry?

20:13.088 --> 20:14.172
Thanks for seeing us.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.465
-This is my wife.
-Kate.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.467
So nice to finally meet you.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.968
-Hi.
-(Larry laughs)

20:19.052 --> 20:21.805
Toby, in answer to your
question, I found out the owners

20:21.888 --> 20:23.765
updated the kitchen and the HVAC

20:23.848 --> 20:25.058
-five years ago.
-Great.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.267
LARRY:
And they'd be open

20:26.351 --> 20:28.311
to leaving the trampoline
for Jack and Hailey.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.271
Yes!

20:30.355 --> 20:31.648
(Toby laughs)

20:31.731 --> 20:34.067
-I'll let you guys explore.
-Thank you.

20:34.150 --> 20:35.151
Oh, yeah, there's a trampoline.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.778
(chuckles)

20:36.861 --> 20:38.488
How many times
have you been here?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.323
Just a couple.
I run by here all the time.

20:40.407 --> 20:41.783
I've always loved this house.

20:41.866 --> 20:44.244
One day, a "for sale" sign
went up, and, I don't know,

20:44.327 --> 20:46.830
it just got me thinking.
The great part is that

20:46.913 --> 20:49.082
the kids' rooms aren't too far
from what would be our room,

20:49.165 --> 20:51.167
so we'd be close but not
right on top of each other.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.128
Come on, I want to show you.

20:58.258 --> 21:00.635
Larry, thank you so much.
I'll call you, okay?

21:00.719 --> 21:03.096
I will. Don't do anything
until I call.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.140
(sighs)

21:05.223 --> 21:08.184
So... so, what'd you think, huh?

21:09.227 --> 21:11.438
I think it's overwhelming.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.399
I'm... I am sure. I know that,
I know that this feels quick,

21:14.482 --> 21:16.526
but don't panic, the owners
aren't accepting offers

21:16.609 --> 21:18.737
until the day after tomorrow,
so we have plenty of time

21:18.820 --> 21:21.114
to think about it and put
together a pros-and-cons list.

21:21.197 --> 21:22.991
Uh, the day after tomorrow
is not enough time

21:23.074 --> 21:25.326
to-to make this...
this huge decision.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.121
I mean, Toby,
can we even afford it?

21:28.204 --> 21:29.664
Yes. We can.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.499
Because I may have
already gotten us

21:31.583 --> 21:33.126
preapproved for a loan

21:33.209 --> 21:35.295
and talked to a real estate
agent back in L.A.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.088
about what we could get
for our house.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.301
Toby, I thought that
we were just, like,

21:41.384 --> 21:44.137
wrapping our heads around the
idea of San Francisco, and...

21:44.220 --> 21:45.930
and now we're making
this big decision

21:46.014 --> 21:47.432
and putting an offer on a house

21:47.515 --> 21:50.060
-that I'm-I'm seeing
for the first time?
-I know.

21:50.143 --> 21:51.978
I'm sorry. I just, I-I didn't,

21:52.062 --> 21:54.314
I didn't want to present you
with hypotheticals.

21:54.397 --> 21:57.150
Kate, trust me, I have put
a lot of thought into this.

21:57.233 --> 22:00.528
There are these
incredible hiking trails

22:00.612 --> 22:02.655
that lead to an awesome park
right on the Bay.

22:02.739 --> 22:05.033
We're near the airport
for easy trips back to L.A.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.245
Kate...

22:09.329 --> 22:11.623
we can do this.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.917
We can make a life up here,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.044
together.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.840
Come on, let me show you where
your mom and Miguel can stay.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.217
Come on. You're gonna love it.

22:26.930 --> 22:29.265
Okay, Katie girl. You ready to
get your face in the water, huh?

22:29.349 --> 22:31.935
Come on, come on. Let's do it
together, let's do it together.

22:32.018 --> 22:33.895
-We'll do it together.
-No, no, no, no, no!

22:33.978 --> 22:35.689
Okay, okay, how about, uh...

22:38.775 --> 22:41.486
How about a new tactic, okay?

22:41.569 --> 22:44.906
How about... how about
we float on your back?

22:44.989 --> 22:48.034
Okay? I'll be right here so
that you don't go under, okay?

22:48.118 --> 22:50.745
All right, here,
just let go, just let go.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.125
Okay, so...

22:55.208 --> 22:56.751
you're in a bad spot,

22:56.835 --> 22:59.879
but that's just for now.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.506
Dad hasn't been gone that long.

23:01.589 --> 23:03.675
-Everything's weird.
-Yeah.

23:03.758 --> 23:05.969
And maybe instead of focusing
on what's not so great,

23:06.052 --> 23:07.971
you can focus on what
you want to happen next.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.682
Like, what do you want to do?
What do you want to be?

23:10.765 --> 23:14.019
God, you guys. Come on.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.688
Guidance counselor's not
a good look on either of you.

23:16.771 --> 23:19.524
If you could dream
of doing anything,

23:19.607 --> 23:22.318
what would it be? Anything.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.612
That is the problem.

23:26.239 --> 23:28.158
I can't think of anything.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.993
Okay, I'm not like you guys.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.995
You know, you want
to be an actor,

23:32.078 --> 23:34.622
and you want
to change the world.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.375
We're the exact same age,
and you guys are

23:37.459 --> 23:40.003
way ahead of me.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.506
Randall, you've already met
the love of your life.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.383
And, Kevin, I mean,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.385
you're so far ahead, you've
already ruined one marriage.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.475
I just...

23:57.312 --> 24:00.273
When I look into my future...

24:01.733 --> 24:04.319
I literally see

24:04.402 --> 24:06.446
nothing.

24:06.529 --> 24:09.407
No job, no family.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.912
Nothing.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.123
<i>TOBY:</i>
<i>You know,</i>

24:17.207 --> 24:19.501
you wouldn't think it would
take this long to get a Lyft

24:19.584 --> 24:21.419
in the town
where the company was started.

24:23.004 --> 24:25.423
Hey, listen, I'm sorry

24:25.507 --> 24:27.717
that I sprung the house thing
on you like that.

24:27.801 --> 24:30.261
I-I meant for it
to be a grand gesture,

24:30.345 --> 24:32.764
and I think it might have been
a grand mistake.

24:32.847 --> 24:35.058
I'm just excited
for you to be up here.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.727
I know. I am, too.

24:37.811 --> 24:41.022
I'm just processing is all.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.857
-Okay. Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:42.941 --> 24:45.068
Everybody at work is really
excited to meet you tonight.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.070
I think we're gonna have
a really good time.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.738
Me, too.

24:48.822 --> 24:52.617
-The driver can cancel?
That's a thing?
-Mm-hmm.

24:52.701 --> 24:54.369
-Okay.
-Can we just walk?

24:54.452 --> 24:58.039
Uh, it...
No, I'll just get another one.

24:58.123 --> 25:00.834
Well, I thought you said
your boss lived close by.

25:00.917 --> 25:04.295
Yeah, it's not far,
but it's... it's...

25:04.379 --> 25:06.131
-You know.
-But what?

25:06.214 --> 25:10.385
It's-it's all up...
uphill, so...

25:14.347 --> 25:18.601
There we go. Casey is gonna
be here in eight minutes.

25:19.602 --> 25:22.522
Why is the car spinning
in circles?

25:22.605 --> 25:24.649
Oh, this is so beautiful.

25:24.733 --> 25:27.110
Yeah, my-my boss
sold his first company

25:27.193 --> 25:29.571
to Google
for a boatload of money.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.364
Like, literally,
that's how he got his boat.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.783
But he's surprisingly down
to earth, as is everyone,

25:33.867 --> 25:35.160
especially for a bunch
of tech weenies.

25:35.243 --> 25:36.953
Oh, and here's a warning.

25:37.037 --> 25:39.372
Do not ask anyone
what they actually do

25:39.456 --> 25:40.790
for work, trust me.

25:40.874 --> 25:43.001
There they are.
The couple of the hour.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.003
Finally, I get to meet
the famous Kate.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.880
-Hi.
-Kate, this is my boss, Amir.

25:46.963 --> 25:49.090
Nice to meet you,
and you are way too young

25:49.174 --> 25:50.675
to be the Amir
that I've heard so much about.

25:50.759 --> 25:52.093
What are you, like, 25?

25:52.177 --> 25:53.845
I love her instantly, Toby.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.347
-I knew you would.
-(Kate laughs)

25:55.430 --> 25:57.474
-Well, thank you
for having us tonight.
-Are you kidding?

25:57.557 --> 25:59.642
I've been wanting to meet you
ever since Toby joined us.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.687
-Come on, I'll give you a tour.
-Okay.
-(Toby sighs)

26:02.771 --> 26:04.147
So you've been with the company
a while, then?

26:04.230 --> 26:07.567
Yupper.
Started here after Facebook,

26:07.650 --> 26:10.320
-and just never left.
-Wow. And what do you do?

26:10.403 --> 26:13.365
Uh, you know how
most businesses can't afford

26:13.448 --> 26:17.702
non-technical managers
ideating unrealistic features?

26:17.786 --> 26:19.704
Mm-hmm.

26:19.788 --> 26:22.040
And your kids are so cute.
Toby showed me the picture

26:22.123 --> 26:24.292
of Hailey wrapped around Jack
like a baby koala.

26:24.376 --> 26:27.545
I called my wife immediately and
told her, "Let's have a baby."

26:27.629 --> 26:30.006
-Oh.
-TOBY: Their cuteness
is powerful.

26:30.090 --> 26:33.677
-Oh.
-It really is. Thank you.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.137
So, whether it's reporting
or machine learning,

26:36.221 --> 26:38.139
I automate tasks for the company

26:38.223 --> 26:39.808
because no one wants
communication

26:39.891 --> 26:41.768
and product inefficiencies
between the engineers

26:41.851 --> 26:43.269
and everybody else, right?

26:43.353 --> 26:44.896
-Right.
-Which is where I come in.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.898
What do you know
about infrastructure platforms?

26:46.981 --> 26:49.025
-Um...
-She thinks they're overrated,
just like Smash Mouth.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.236
Have you tried this? Try this.

26:51.319 --> 26:53.029
-Oh. Thanks. Sure.
-Thanks so much.
Can I borrow her? Hey, come on.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.447
-Enjoy.
-(laughs)

26:54.531 --> 26:55.949
How you doing? You doing okay?

26:56.032 --> 26:57.575
Yeah. Yeah, I really am.

26:57.659 --> 27:00.787
-I mean, Toby,
everybody's really great.
-Yeah.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.039
-Hi, Kate. Sorry to interrupt.
-Hi.

27:03.123 --> 27:05.250
But Warren said you agreed
to trade him Steph Curry.

27:05.333 --> 27:07.419
-What? No!
-Is that true?

27:07.502 --> 27:09.421
Why would I do that? Curry's
like the heart of my team.

27:09.504 --> 27:11.089
Sorry.
This is fantasy basketball.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.508
I'll be back in one
and a half seconds. Oh.

27:13.591 --> 27:15.218
(laughing):
What are you...

27:15.301 --> 27:17.846
What are you talking about,
I give you Curry?

27:17.929 --> 27:19.597
-WARREN: You said it.
-TOBY: I said it in a bar.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.683
-WARREN: Oh, no.
-I said it in bar.

27:21.766 --> 27:24.269
You can't believe anything
anyone says in a bar.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.062
-WARREN: That counts.
-That does not count.

27:26.146 --> 27:28.690
-Not in the state of California.
-It's happening. I'm sorry.

27:28.773 --> 27:31.317
(indistinct chatter)

27:42.912 --> 27:44.998
I'm so happy you came. (laughs)

27:45.081 --> 27:47.292
Toby's been a lifesaver up here.

27:47.375 --> 27:50.086
Most popular at the company
by multiple degrees

27:50.170 --> 27:52.714
in an office where everyone
genuinely likes each other.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.633
Well, the feeling
is very mutual.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.303
Thank God he turned down
the job offer back in L.A.

28:57.737 --> 28:59.656
We're not going to dinner.
We need to leave.

29:01.199 --> 29:03.743
Okay. I'll just call us a Lyft.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.037
Hey, what is...? Okay.

29:06.121 --> 29:08.498
Kate? Kate? Kate, Kate, Kate.

29:08.581 --> 29:10.000
What is...?
what's-what's the matter?

29:10.083 --> 29:11.501
You got a job offer in L.A.?

29:14.337 --> 29:17.173
Y-Yeah, I applied for that job

29:17.257 --> 29:19.175
long before
I got the job up here.

29:19.259 --> 29:20.844
And the official offer came in

29:20.927 --> 29:22.595
two weeks ago,
and it was a joke.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.639
It was, like, a big step-down
in title, and barely any money.

29:24.723 --> 29:26.433
You made a decision
that directly affects me

29:26.516 --> 29:28.435
and our children
without telling me?

29:28.518 --> 29:30.562
-You lied to me.
-I didn't lie to you.

29:30.645 --> 29:32.647
And you made a fool
out of me in there.

29:33.732 --> 29:34.899
Uh...

29:37.777 --> 29:39.696
Can we just talk about this
before we get in this car?

29:39.779 --> 29:40.905
No. I need a minute.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.935
All right, how much?

30:12.187 --> 30:13.563
How much what?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.690
How much more
does the job pay up here?

30:16.733 --> 30:18.360
You want me to give you numbers?

30:18.443 --> 30:20.528
Yeah. Yeah, Toby,
I'd like numbers.

30:20.612 --> 30:23.365
I need to know how much is worth
me giving up my job,

30:23.448 --> 30:25.742
and a house
where Jack feels comfortable,

30:25.825 --> 30:28.912
not to mention being near
my family and my sick mother

30:28.995 --> 30:31.539
in the same city as Hailey has
two cousins the same age

30:31.623 --> 30:33.792
-to grow up with.
-That's not a fair question.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.544
It's not fair that you're not
thinking about our family?

30:36.628 --> 30:38.755
I'm not thinking
about our family?

30:38.838 --> 30:40.423
Wow. That's awesome.

30:40.507 --> 30:42.300
How have you been, then?

30:42.384 --> 30:44.302
What do you think
I have been doing up here?

30:44.386 --> 30:46.304
Living out of a suitcase,

30:46.388 --> 30:48.390
not-not sure
which city I'm waking up in,

30:48.473 --> 30:51.309
spending all these lonely nights
in this antiseptic apartment.

30:51.393 --> 30:54.312
This is all
for our family, Kate.

30:54.396 --> 30:56.398
Do you know
that we have a blind son?

30:56.481 --> 30:58.316
Oh, really?
I-I didn't realize.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.776
I thought he was just clumsy.

30:59.859 --> 31:01.778
He knows every inch
of our house.

31:01.861 --> 31:03.988
We're teaching him a song
to get to the park.

31:04.072 --> 31:05.824
Okay, you think
it's easy to just, like,

31:05.907 --> 31:07.867
uproot him and-and put him
in a new environment?

31:07.951 --> 31:10.495
Okay, you get to ask
a bunch of questions.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.747
Let me ask a few.

31:12.831 --> 31:15.208
Have you penciled out
how expensive it would be

31:15.291 --> 31:17.419
to send Jack to a special school
if he needs one?

31:17.502 --> 31:19.337
Because I have.

31:19.421 --> 31:22.632
Never mind all of the assistive
technology he's gonna need.

31:22.716 --> 31:27.053
Do you know a braille notetaker
alone costs six grand?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.555
And that-that-that...
that's just

31:28.638 --> 31:30.390
when he's living
at home with us.

31:30.473 --> 31:31.975
What if he wants to go off
to college

31:32.058 --> 31:33.727
or live on his own one day?

31:34.769 --> 31:37.063
I have big dreams
for our son, Kate,

31:37.147 --> 31:40.525
and I'm gonna be damn sure
that he has whatever he needs

31:40.608 --> 31:43.069
to live his life
however he so chooses.

31:43.153 --> 31:46.656
And we can't afford any of that
on an assistant teacher salary

31:46.740 --> 31:48.950
and some middling job
in Los Angeles

31:49.034 --> 31:51.327
that doesn't pay me
any real money.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.955
Right. Money. Still haven't
told me the number.

31:58.376 --> 32:00.587
It's not just about the money,
is it?

32:03.214 --> 32:05.884
It's kind of about you. Right?

32:05.967 --> 32:07.886
Watching you up here--
I don't know--

32:07.969 --> 32:10.430
you're pretty much the happiest
you've ever been, aren't you?

32:10.513 --> 32:13.183
Kate, I am away from my family.

32:13.266 --> 32:16.728
I'm-I'm on four planes a week.
I am exhausted.

32:16.811 --> 32:19.481
Yeah, but you're happy, right?

32:19.564 --> 32:21.483
You're happy with your job,
with your stature.

32:21.566 --> 32:22.901
-(laughs)
-Personally, you're happy.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.736
I-I don't know why
you just can't admit it.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.529
Yes, yes, I'm happy!
I'm happy.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.198
And this is gonna sound
like a strange question

32:28.281 --> 32:30.158
to ask my wife,
but don't you want that for me?

32:30.241 --> 32:32.369
Of course I want that for you.

32:34.371 --> 32:36.581
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

32:39.417 --> 32:41.544
You know,
sometimes I look at you, Toby,

32:41.628 --> 32:45.548
and I don't even know
who you are anymore. I don't.

32:45.632 --> 32:49.010
You drink expensive champagne.

32:49.094 --> 32:51.179
You know how to work a room.

32:51.262 --> 32:54.474
You're not the guy who wore
those terrible Hawaiian shirts

32:54.557 --> 32:57.018
or would make those loud,
inappropriate jokes.

32:57.102 --> 32:59.020
You're not the guy
who'd ask for the wine list

32:59.104 --> 33:00.689
and says,
"Bring me the whole left side."

33:00.772 --> 33:03.775
The goofy guy
from our first date,

33:03.858 --> 33:07.278
the Old Toby, the guy
that I fell in love with.

33:08.863 --> 33:10.865
I miss him.

33:12.617 --> 33:16.454
I miss him so much
that I've been picturing him

33:16.538 --> 33:18.832
this weekend here with me.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.043
So this whole time
that I've been thinking

33:22.127 --> 33:24.004
that we're really connecting,

33:24.087 --> 33:26.297
you've just been
imagining yourself

33:26.381 --> 33:28.383
with a different version of me?

33:28.466 --> 33:31.219
That is not what I said.
That's not what I'm saying.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.221
-Is he... is he here?
-Don't do that.

33:33.304 --> 33:35.557
Is he here now? Oh, you know,
maybe we should just...

33:35.640 --> 33:38.309
we should get him out here.
Hey, let's get Old Toby out here

33:38.393 --> 33:41.563
to join in on this fun! Huh?
Hey, you know...

33:41.646 --> 33:43.732
you know what I'd love
to say to Old Toby, Kate?

33:44.774 --> 33:47.110
He was a mess.

33:47.193 --> 33:51.406
He was miserable
and insecure and self-loathing.

33:51.489 --> 33:54.034
And all-all of that goofiness

33:54.117 --> 33:58.121
and-and the loud jokes--
that was out of self-defense.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.957
Kate, you fell in love
with a coping mechanism.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.960
And FYI, if that guy
hadn't changed,

34:04.044 --> 34:06.588
he would have jumped off a
bridge or died of a heart attack

34:06.671 --> 34:08.423
making a joke
at his own expense.

34:08.506 --> 34:10.842
Wait.
I almost did that last part.

34:14.679 --> 34:18.475
What is so terrible
about me right now?

34:19.517 --> 34:21.895
That I don't want
to dress like a clown?

34:21.978 --> 34:24.814
That I want to buy a nice house
for my family?

34:26.983 --> 34:28.735
I don't know, Toby.

34:28.818 --> 34:30.445
You're just different.

34:31.488 --> 34:34.199
And you're not, Kate?

34:35.867 --> 34:37.911
Why is this conversation
all about me?

34:39.496 --> 34:41.581
When-when...
when we first got together,

34:41.664 --> 34:44.417
it felt like you and me
against the world.

34:44.501 --> 34:47.545
And today, you couldn't go
20 minutes

34:47.629 --> 34:49.756
just us,
without FaceTiming the kids.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.758
After shooting down
an entire day

34:51.841 --> 34:54.219
that I spent weeks planning
for you.

34:54.302 --> 34:55.637
Admit I'm happy?

34:55.720 --> 34:57.389
Kate, what about you?

34:57.472 --> 35:00.600
You love the life
that you are living,

35:00.684 --> 35:04.562
this life that you are building
without me,

35:04.646 --> 35:07.315
where you're the...
you're the working supermom

35:07.399 --> 35:09.609
who gets to live
with her brother again.

35:09.693 --> 35:12.404
You finally get to be
the fully realized

35:12.487 --> 35:14.948
version of yourself,
and all you had to do

35:15.031 --> 35:17.075
was get me out of that house.

35:24.874 --> 35:27.711
When I was younger, I would...

35:27.794 --> 35:29.921
well, I couldn't even think
about the future

35:30.005 --> 35:32.674
because it just was blank.

35:32.757 --> 35:36.469
And... (sighs heavily)

35:36.553 --> 35:38.471
I felt that way for a really...

35:38.555 --> 35:40.765
a long, long time
until I met you.

35:40.849 --> 35:45.562
And you... you took away a lot
of that emptiness.

35:46.688 --> 35:50.400
And so, yeah, Toby,
now I have a full life

35:50.483 --> 35:53.028
that I could have never dreamed.

35:54.279 --> 35:57.282
And I feel healthy,
I feel connected,

35:57.365 --> 36:00.785
I feel like I have a purpose.

36:00.869 --> 36:03.913
I love my life.
I'm-I'm really, really happy.

36:11.004 --> 36:14.883
Except for the one thing that's
making me really, really sad.

36:32.192 --> 36:34.194
Thank you.

36:37.197 --> 36:39.115
We should have talked
about the L.A. offer

36:39.199 --> 36:40.992
even if it wasn't a good one.

36:44.829 --> 36:47.624
We probably
should have also talked

36:47.707 --> 36:49.626
about the fact
that for most of my life,

36:49.709 --> 36:54.130
I have been desperate, desperate
to feel valued at my job,

36:54.214 --> 36:57.258
to not just feel like
I'm taking up space.

36:59.511 --> 37:01.638
I can relate.

37:01.721 --> 37:07.352
And... I'm not just
taking up space here, Kate.

37:08.395 --> 37:10.730
And neither are you.

37:10.814 --> 37:16.027
As wrung out
and as exhausted as I am,

37:16.111 --> 37:18.738
I'm happy for us.

37:18.822 --> 37:20.907
We have both
figured out our worth.

37:23.034 --> 37:25.120
We evolved.

37:25.203 --> 37:28.164
I love you. I love our family.

37:28.248 --> 37:31.376
But there are some real-world
logistics at play here,

37:31.459 --> 37:33.461
and we are gonna have to move
to San Francisco.

37:33.545 --> 37:36.214
That's how these logistics
are gonna play out.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.925
I need you to get on board
because...

37:39.009 --> 37:42.178
moving here is the only way
that we are gonna stay a family.

37:42.262 --> 37:44.389
It is the only option.

37:45.890 --> 37:47.934
(Kate sighs)

37:50.311 --> 37:52.564
I'm gonna go get some air.

37:55.108 --> 37:57.110
Okay.

37:59.654 --> 38:01.781
(door opens)

38:04.451 --> 38:06.828
All right, gang, it's time
to get the hell out of here.

38:06.911 --> 38:08.121
How?

38:09.914 --> 38:11.541
We climb.

38:33.438 --> 38:36.399
Hey, Katie girl, look at me.
Look at me.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.943
I believe you can do it.

38:39.027 --> 38:42.238
Okay, and Mommy,
Randall and Kevin--

38:42.322 --> 38:43.990
they believe you can do it.

38:44.074 --> 38:46.451
Now the only thing
that needs to happen

38:46.534 --> 38:49.788
is that <i>you</i> believe
you can do it.

38:52.415 --> 38:53.833
Okay?

39:02.676 --> 39:04.135
I'm gonna go over
to the other side,

39:04.219 --> 39:05.679
and then I'll help you down.

39:07.764 --> 39:10.058
(grunting)

39:14.938 --> 39:16.481
Just...

39:18.066 --> 39:19.818
I'll meet you at the top.

39:26.950 --> 39:30.787
One step at a time, Kate.
No sweat.

39:30.870 --> 39:32.872
(panting)

39:42.007 --> 39:45.010
(breathing deeply)

39:55.186 --> 39:58.231
Okay, Katie girl.
Here's the moment.

39:59.274 --> 40:02.193
Just let go.
Katie, just let go. Let go.

40:02.277 --> 40:05.363
I will never let go, Daddy,
ever!

40:05.447 --> 40:06.740
Yeah? Why not?

40:07.782 --> 40:09.743
Why would I?

40:16.374 --> 40:18.168
RANDALL:
Come on, Kate. Just grab it.

40:20.170 --> 40:22.255
-Guys...
-You got this.

40:22.339 --> 40:24.591
-You got this, Kate.
-You got it.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.217
Okay.

40:30.764 --> 40:32.682
-You got it.
-(grunts)

40:32.766 --> 40:34.017
KEVIN:
You're almost there, Kate.
Let's go.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.852
KEVIN:
Almost there! Oh!

40:35.935 --> 40:37.854
-(gasps, shrieks) No.
-Okay.

40:37.937 --> 40:39.356
-Okay, relax.
-Uh-uh. No.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.232
-We're gonna try it again.
-No, I can't.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.818
I can't, no.

40:43.902 --> 40:45.487
No.

40:52.369 --> 40:54.412
This one.

40:56.915 --> 40:58.208
How'd she do?

40:58.291 --> 41:01.252
(scoffs)
Today is not the day.

41:09.052 --> 41:11.054
(panting)

41:22.899 --> 41:25.151
(laughing)

41:34.744 --> 41:36.788
(line ringing)

41:36.871 --> 41:38.790
<i>PHILLIP:</i>
<i>Hey, Kate. How's Frisco?</i>

41:38.873 --> 41:41.459
<i>Is it foggy and expensive?</i>

41:41.543 --> 41:45.714
Did you, uh,
fill Sheila's job yet?

41:45.797 --> 41:49.092
Uh, no, but we're looking
at applicants.

41:51.136 --> 41:52.762
I'd like to be considered.
