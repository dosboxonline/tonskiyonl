15:20.337 --> 15:22.297
-I was always a night owl.
-Mm-hmm.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.217
But, uh, one morning, I wake up
real early, no reason,

15:26.301 --> 15:28.970
but I can't fall back asleep,
so I figure

15:29.054 --> 15:32.349
get a cup of coffee
at the place down the way.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.227
So, I sit down at my favorite
table by the window,

15:36.311 --> 15:41.566
and this woman comes over
and says, "You're at my table."

15:41.649 --> 15:46.363
Well, it turns out,
we had the same favorite table.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.157
She always sat there early
and I sat there late.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.912
So, I offer to share the table.

15:53.995 --> 15:57.791
The next morning, I got there
when the place opened,

15:57.874 --> 15:59.459
so did she.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.629
And that was the end
of the night owl.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.841
You know, it took, um...

16:06.925 --> 16:10.428
took some time
to earn her trust, but...

16:10.512 --> 16:12.889

how to make her laugh.

34:26.191 --> 34:29.652
wasn't an easy place
to be a son.

But it wasn't an easy place
to be a mother, either.

34:36.451 --> 34:40.288

34:40.372 --> 34:43.917

because we got out.

But when you live
in a house like that,

34:51.132 --> 34:54.302
there's a part of you
that never gets out.

34:56.388 --> 35:00.725
So you build a new house.

35:02.143 --> 35:05.480
A better house
for a better life.
