WEBVTT

00:11.553 --> 00:13.138
Hi, how you doing?

00:14.056 --> 00:15.098
You new around here?

00:15.182 --> 00:16.308
To planet Earth?

00:17.351 --> 00:18.644
No, I'm 13.

00:18.727 --> 00:22.147
But I'm also fairly certain
this is my third life reincarnated.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.066
Well, color me impressed

00:24.149 --> 00:27.194
'cause my third lap around this big blue
marble I was nothing but a horsefly.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.863
-Oh, I've never seen a horse fly.
-No?

00:29.947 --> 00:32.241
Saw a horse pee once.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.534
That was a lot.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.410
Yeah. Noisy too.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.667
To be honest, now that
my lower back tattoo's completely gone,

00:41.750 --> 00:42.835
I kinda miss it.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.797
Here comes the biscuits train!
Choo choo!

00:47.756 --> 00:48.882
Sassy Smurf!

00:48.966 --> 00:50.342
-Marlboro Man.
-What?

00:50.425 --> 00:51.343
Hey! Hey!

00:52.511 --> 00:55.013
All right! How about that? Yeah.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.849
-Here you go, boss.
-Thank you.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.267
Hey, who's the new receptionist?

00:58.350 --> 00:59.893
That's Nora, my daughter.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.353
Okay. Wait…

01:04.063 --> 01:05.065
Is she mine?

01:05.147 --> 01:07.860
Ted, we had sex like six months ago.

01:07.943 --> 01:10.237
Right, right. Sorry. Yeah, bad math.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.780
And if memory serves, you finished on my--

01:11.864 --> 01:14.157
Hey! Yeah.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.326
No reason to get into
the science of it all

01:16.410 --> 01:18.078
in front of the boss here, you know.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.496
So… anyhoo…

01:19.580 --> 01:21.665
What's the hap, Sass?
What brings your fun buns in town?

01:21.748 --> 01:26.128
I'm speaking at a conference in Brighton.
So Nora is staying with Stinky here.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.921
Yes, and I am going to make good

01:28.005 --> 01:30.757
on every single one of her wishes
from the last six years.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.051
Just make sure one of those wishes

01:33.135 --> 01:35.387
is a spare tampon then,
Miss Fairy Godmother.

01:37.639 --> 01:40.726
That girl is an errant cobblestone away
from her first period.

01:42.477 --> 01:44.563
Well, bibbidi-bobbidi-booyah.
You know.

01:45.606 --> 01:48.358
Always good to see ya, Sass.
Straight shooter.

01:49.193 --> 01:51.403
Okay, I'll let you ladies get back to it.
All right? TTFN. Yeah?

01:52.321 --> 01:53.363
Hey, you know what?

01:53.447 --> 01:56.783
What do you say we do what the man says
and make today our masterpiece, yeah?

01:58.660 --> 01:59.661
Okay.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.834
-Did he talk like that when--
-The whole time and so eager to please.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.586
It was fabulous.

02:32.611 --> 02:34.029
-Ted!
-Coach!

02:34.112 --> 02:36.031
All right, Lloyd, why don't you go
all Pat Benatar on me, yeah?

02:36.114 --> 02:37.908
And hit you with my best shot?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.952
-Fire away.
-Yes!

02:40.035 --> 02:43.705
So, you've got Coventry City this weekend,
where you're heavily favored.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.375
You think this'll end your team's
embarrassing streak of draws?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.795
Oh, Lloyd, I've never been embarrassed
about having streaks in my drawers.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.047
It's all part of growing up. Yeah?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.340
All right, who else?

02:53.423 --> 02:54.424
Yes, sir.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.884
Trent Crimm, The Independent.

02:55.968 --> 02:58.512
Hi, Trent. Make like Dunst and Union
and bring it on, baby.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.559
Ted, you're known for creating
a great environment in the locker room,

03:03.642 --> 03:06.895
but do you think the return
of the prodigal son, Jamie Tartt,

03:06.979 --> 03:09.773
will impact that so-called "vibe"?

03:09.857 --> 03:12.067
Well, I don't think so, Trent.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.570
Yeah. I believe that Jamie's on a path
to becoming a better man

03:14.653 --> 03:16.405
and I'm just here to help him
along that journey.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.782
You know, think of me
as his own personal Mr. Miyagi.

03:19.992 --> 03:22.411
Except without all that extra yard work.
Yeah.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.628
-Knock knock!
-Hey!

03:31.712 --> 03:34.006
Sam, I think I have something
you might wanna see.

03:34.089 --> 03:35.090
Okay?

03:35.174 --> 03:37.885
You wanna look at your photos
from the Dubai Air shoot?

03:37.968 --> 03:39.094
Yes, please.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.263
Oh, God. I'm very nervous.
But also very excited.

03:41.346 --> 03:44.099
That's similar to whenever Colin
drives me somewhere in his Lamborghini.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.934
Aye, it's true.
It's way too much car for me.

03:46.643 --> 03:50.063
-Look at you! I mean, come on.
-Wow!

03:50.147 --> 03:52.816
You're a mood.
You're a moment. You're a mantra.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.568
Those sound like compliments. Thank you.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.029
Bruh, I'm confused.
Is this an ad for ugly people?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.325
Congratulations, amigo. I can't wait
to see these up in a tube station.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.368
Yeah, so I can draw a dick on his face.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.870
Yeah!

04:04.953 --> 04:06.830
Bro, why you wearing
your kit on the plane?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.626
'Cause it's the only way
they'll know he's a footballer.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.132
Anyways, man. What are we…

04:17.216 --> 04:19.134
-The pictures are so great.
-Thank you so much.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.844
-Yeah, I'm so proud of you!
-Thanks.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.304
-I'll see you later.
-I'll see you later.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.681
Oh, boys. Will you remember to sign up

04:24.765 --> 04:27.100
for that new dating app
I emailed you all about?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.353
It would really help draw some traction

04:29.436 --> 04:31.855
if there were some young,
hot footballers on there.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.023
Yeah, well…

04:33.106 --> 04:34.525
Keeley, what was the name again?

04:34.608 --> 04:37.819
Bantr. B-A-N-T-R.

04:37.903 --> 04:38.987
Like Grindr.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.949
Yeah.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.034
Well, promise me you'll just check it out?

04:44.117 --> 04:45.911
-Of course.
-You're the best!

04:46.828 --> 04:47.913
Bye!

04:47.996 --> 04:50.457
Okay, fellas. Got a big game this weekend.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.626
-What are we looking at, Coach?
-Very physical.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.045
-Okay. All right. Anything else?
-Borderline violent.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.421
You heard the man.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.632
Still can't believe y'all don't have pads
in this sport. It's amazing.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.343
Sorry, Coach.
Do you mind if I say something, please?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.971
Yeah. No, sure, Jamie.
Come on. Yeah.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.056
Thanks.

05:10.561 --> 05:12.229
I know I wasn't the greatest teammate.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.983
I did some shitty things.
I said some shitty things.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.319
But I want each and every one of you
to know that I'm truly sorry

05:19.403 --> 05:22.656
and I'm ready to do whatever it takes
to make it up to ya. Yeah?

05:24.950 --> 05:26.910
You called me a jaundiced worm.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.745
Right, yeah.
And I'm sorry about that, Colin.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.664
In a profile for my hometown paper.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.125
You hit on my mum.

05:34.168 --> 05:35.294
In front of my dad.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.046
I apologize for that, Bumbercatch.

05:38.714 --> 05:40.257
Please tell your father I'm sorry.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.301
And give Janet me best, yeah?

05:50.309 --> 05:53.270
He said that you cupped a fart
and put it in his face.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.481
Sounds better in French.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.235
Yeah. I know.
I do remember that and I'm sorry.

06:00.944 --> 06:02.362
Hey, is there anyone else?

06:02.446 --> 06:03.697
You got us relegated, mate.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.536
I don't know you, but I don't like you.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.833
I am not a worm.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.585
Okay, fellas. All right. That's good.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.795
Good apology. Way to get the ball rolling.
Okay. Come on, guys. Let's go.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.088
Let's get out on the pitch.
Settle it out there.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.924
Let's go, Richmond!

06:22.007 --> 06:23.675
Here we go now. Come on.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.599
Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.271
I remember the last time
I brought you here

06:36.355 --> 06:39.483
we played that contest of who could fit
the most little sandwiches in their mouth.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.486
Yeah. That was a while ago.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.454
-This is silly, isn't it?
-No, not at all.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.623
Don't know what I was thinking.
You're not six anymore, are you?

06:55.165 --> 06:56.333
It's fine. Really.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.085
Should we go somewhere else though?

06:58.669 --> 07:00.671
-Yes.
-I'll get the bill.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.258
Then you're coming back, right?

07:04.341 --> 07:05.425
Yes, why?

07:05.509 --> 07:08.554
Just making sure you're not gonna
disappear for another six years.

07:10.597 --> 07:11.598
I'm joking.

07:13.225 --> 07:14.726
Okay, I deserved that.

07:22.734 --> 07:26.822
All right, fellas, I think we've all had
enough of this amuse-bouche.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.991
Time to move on to the main course.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.910
-Chef Beard, what's on the menu?
-11 v 11. Let's go!

07:33.203 --> 07:34.496
Let's go! Let's go!

07:36.081 --> 07:38.250
Hey, Jamie. Come here real quick.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.587
Yeah, there you go.
Yeah, keep them hips loose.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.089
That's it. Take your time. Love it.

07:44.173 --> 07:45.632
Boy, I wish I could move like that.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.134
-To be so young.
-Yeah.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.761
So, hey, we're gonna start you out
on the reserve squad, all right?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.096
No problem, Coach. Yeah.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.765
Figure it would be good for the fellas
to see ya earn your spot back.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.435
Smart. Yeah.

07:56.518 --> 07:59.521
Nothing more likable than watching
somebody humbly overcome adversity

07:59.605 --> 08:01.523
with their effortless God-given talent.
Pow.

08:01.607 --> 08:03.775
Hey, just do me a favor. Don't try to do
too much out there, all right?

08:03.859 --> 08:05.152
I know what you mean, Coach.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.486
Yeah.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.157
Mr. Kit man! Hit me!

08:11.074 --> 08:12.826
-Hey, you think he heard me?
-I do.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.828
-Think he gonna listen to me?
-I do not.

08:14.912 --> 08:18.624
-Yeah.
-They are going to kill him.

08:21.418 --> 08:24.671
Sorry. He just wasn't
very nice to me either, so…

08:27.049 --> 08:28.550
Go, go!

08:31.678 --> 08:33.013
Jamie! Jamie!

08:34.306 --> 08:36.767
-Jamie! Jamie!
-Yeah!

08:40.729 --> 08:43.524
Hey, while you were off
filming your little TV show,

08:43.607 --> 08:45.317
some things changed around here.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.027
Don't bring that weak rubbish my way.

08:49.738 --> 08:52.491
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

08:52.574 --> 08:54.952
Come on, come on! Let's go!

09:00.123 --> 09:02.709
-Let's go! Let's go!
-Who's the worm now?

09:02.793 --> 09:04.002
It's not me.

09:05.295 --> 09:06.505
Fuck just happened?

09:07.214 --> 09:10.259
We could go and see a show tonight.
What about The Mouse Trap?

09:10.342 --> 09:13.470
You know that Agatha Christie play
where someone dies every performance?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.557
Usually in the audience.
Seeing as only old people go and see it.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.559
Sure. If that's what you wanna do.

09:18.642 --> 09:22.396
The British Girl Shop. Wanna pop in?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.356
Don't really play with dolls much anymore.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.692
No, of course not.

09:26.775 --> 09:30.279
Besides, why do all their dolls
have to be tragically orphaned?

09:30.362 --> 09:32.865
Edith's parents died in the war.

09:32.948 --> 09:34.616
-Emma's had scurvy.
-Yes.

09:34.700 --> 09:39.037
The Americans really do the historical
doll concept better, don't they?

09:39.621 --> 09:42.457
Must be their innate sense of triumph,
however misguided.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.210
Yeah, but no one does the orphans better
than us Brits.

09:47.963 --> 09:49.089
Thank you, Uncle Roy.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.009
-I love her.
-Oh, good.

10:55.781 --> 10:59.785
Right, so how'd her parents die?
Factory fire? Eaten by rats?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.663
No. Zoe's from the modern line.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.665
Her parents were canceled.

11:06.250 --> 11:09.044
So, what's happening with what's-his-name,
from the steakhouse?

11:09.127 --> 11:10.212
Who, John?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.005
-Yeah.
-I dumped him.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.842
-'Cause of what I said?
-No.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.845
'Cause you were right about what you said.

11:17.928 --> 11:18.929
So what now?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.973
Hell, I don't know.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.601
Keeley's got me on that silly dating app
she's promoting.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.728
-The one with no pictures?
-That's the one.

11:27.437 --> 11:31.358
What? So now you just get a bunch
of unsolicited descriptions of dicks?

11:31.900 --> 11:34.528
Uncle Roy,
can we have ice cream for dinner?

11:34.611 --> 11:36.029
No, that's dumb.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.032
You're right.
Thank you for helping me set boundaries.

11:40.868 --> 11:44.162
-Wow, she really loves you.
-I know. It's fucking annoying.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.667
It's been really gorgeous
reconnecting with Nora.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.336
And I had all these things organized.
Loads of activities.

11:51.420 --> 11:53.046
She's not interested in any of it.

11:53.130 --> 11:57.301
Look, most adults think kids
need to be constantly entertained.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.468
It's bullshit.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.180
I didn't need a fucking parade every day
growing up, did you?

12:01.930 --> 12:04.474
Truth is they just wanna feel
like they're part of our lives.

12:04.558 --> 12:06.727
Little idiots. Watch this.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.356
Phoebe. Do you wanna come
to my podiatrist appointment later?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.900
Yes, please!

12:22.117 --> 12:25.204
Hey, do you fancy
watching a scary movie together?

12:25.287 --> 12:26.455
I can make some popcorn.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.415
You finally learned how to cook, did you?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.793
Sounds fun. I'll be right down.

12:31.877 --> 12:32.878
Great.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.925
And for tomorrow I was wondering--

12:38.008 --> 12:40.511
I mean, it could be a terrible idea.

12:41.345 --> 12:45.682
Would you want to come to work with me
for, like, the whole day

12:45.766 --> 12:47.768
and just join me for meetings and stuff?

12:47.851 --> 12:49.645
It could be tremendously boring.

12:49.728 --> 12:50.771
That would be amazing.

12:51.897 --> 12:52.898
Would it?

12:52.981 --> 12:55.651
Yeah, I've always wanted to see
what it's like to run a football club.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.194
Really? Since when?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
Ever since you started doing it.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.990
I'll be down in a sec.

13:02.616 --> 13:03.617
Okay.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.628
-Hey, Shannon.
-Coach Beard asked me to give this to you.

13:15.254 --> 13:16.338
He had to run off.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.048
Okay. Everything all right?

13:18.632 --> 13:19.716
I don't know.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.261
He mumbled the name Jane
and then sprinted away.

13:22.344 --> 13:23.929
Okay. That makes sense.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.305
What about you? You good?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.808
When are you guys
gonna finally win a match?

13:27.891 --> 13:29.685
Geez louise, Shannon.

13:29.768 --> 13:32.396
Not even Beard comes at me
that strong this early, you know?

13:32.479 --> 13:34.398
We like to start off with a little
small talk, you know?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.608
Like, I'll say,
"Hey, what's the word, Larry Bird?"

13:36.692 --> 13:37.693
Then he'll say--

13:37.776 --> 13:41.113
"Don't call me Larry Bird and when are we
gonna finally win a fucking match?"

13:41.780 --> 13:44.449
Yeah. Like that.
See, much better.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.664
So, being the boss
isn't just about reacting to situations.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.791
It's also about anticipating them as well.

13:52.875 --> 13:56.003
You need to be three, four steps ahead
of everyone else around you.

13:56.086 --> 13:57.171
Good morning, Higgins.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.340
This is my goddaughter, Nora.
She's going to be shadowing me today.

14:00.424 --> 14:02.509
Outstanding! Welcome aboard.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.263
And Miss Welton,
I received your email.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.932
And once again
your suggestion fixed everything.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.143
I mean, brilliant as always.

14:11.768 --> 14:12.978
What are you talking about?

14:13.645 --> 14:15.397
I was just trying to make you look good.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.402
-You blew that.
-Yeah, I did.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.489
And obviously one of the perks
of being in charge

14:24.573 --> 14:26.825
is having your own private sanctum.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.869
Shit!

14:28.952 --> 14:30.495
I didn't think you were coming in today.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.165
When I know you're not gonna be here,
sometimes I use your office.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.334
I like the light
and the absence of smells.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.045
No worries. We had a change of plans.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.713
-Keeley, this is Nora.
-Hey.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.758
Nora, this is Keeley Jones.
Our head of marketing.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.301
Cuppa?

14:45.636 --> 14:47.012
I'm so excited to meet you.

14:47.095 --> 14:48.931
I've heard a lot about you
and I love your mum.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.557
She's so cool.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.437
What's "Bantr"?

14:56.021 --> 14:59.358
It's just a little side hustle gig.
It's a new dating app.

14:59.441 --> 15:02.819
This venture capital firm asked
if I can do some freelance PR for them.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.030
Cool. What's the hook?

15:07.616 --> 15:09.576
It's pretty groovy actually.

15:09.660 --> 15:12.079
They wanna be a less superficial
dating app alternative.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.331
It's completely anonymous, no photos.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.874
It's all about encouraging people
to connect

15:15.958 --> 15:18.043
using their words and personalities.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.045
Yeah, so you don't know if the person
you're communicating with

15:20.128 --> 15:21.547
is remotely fit or not.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.173
Horrifying, isn't it?

15:23.757 --> 15:24.842
I think that's awesome.

15:24.925 --> 15:27.219
Yeah, no. Me too.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.972
Cool.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.433
So, I downloaded Bantr last night.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.560
Attaboy.

15:34.643 --> 15:36.270
Looking for a lady, hey?

15:36.353 --> 15:38.689
Oh, God, no. No, I deleted it immediately.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.693
Besides, I am very picky
when it comes to women.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.029
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.825
But women are pretty picky too, so…

15:50.909 --> 15:53.328
Yeah, I'm not really looking
for anything romantic right now either.

15:53.412 --> 15:55.664
But, boy, what if I did get on there
and I met my soul mate

15:55.747 --> 15:57.207
and it changed the whole course
of my life.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.585
-That'd be pretty neato. Yeah?
-Yeah.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.420
What about you, Coach?
You get on there yet?

16:01.503 --> 16:02.838
No, no, no.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.757
Jane and I took a big step forward
in our relationship this weekend.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.718
We are now sharing an iCloud account.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.429
They call it digital intimacy.

16:11.346 --> 16:14.141
So if she found out
that you downloaded a dating app…

16:14.224 --> 16:17.436
She would destroy my phone
with pliers and a blowtorch. Yes.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.898
Hi, darling.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.150
Diamond Dogs adjourned?

16:27.070 --> 16:28.864
Yeah, I was howling. Like a dog, yeah.

16:28.947 --> 16:29.907
Hey, Jamie.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.243
Hey, how you feeling today?

16:34.203 --> 16:35.537
-Fucking great.
-Yeah?

16:35.621 --> 16:38.624
Yeah, I had this dope idea last night
during me eyebrow threading.

16:39.541 --> 16:43.170
I'm gonna buy the whole team PS5s.
They'll fucking love me.

16:44.963 --> 16:48.967
Yeah, but, you know, some folks might also
consider that buying affection, you know.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.177
Exactly.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.971
Yeah, what better thing
to spend money on than love? Hey?

16:56.308 --> 16:58.310
Boy. He sure does
thread that needle sometimes, don't he?

16:59.853 --> 17:01.438
Well, gentlemen,
I think we might have ourselves

17:01.522 --> 17:03.899
a "break glass in case of emergency"
situation here.

17:05.150 --> 17:07.277
-You know what we gotta do?
-Get Dr. Sharon?

17:07.361 --> 17:09.112
What? No, no, no.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.199
No, I think it's time
for these young fellas to meet…

17:12.281 --> 17:13.492
that guy.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.414
No. No, no.

17:19.498 --> 17:20.958
Oh, yes.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.544
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.463
They don't need to meet that guy.
They don't. Nobody does.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.881
Don't worry, Coach. It's gonna be great.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.259
All right. I'll see you in a little bit.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.095
Who's "that guy"?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.305
Led Tasso.

17:35.389 --> 17:36.932
Who's Led Tasso?

17:38.809 --> 17:39.977
The last resort.

17:41.562 --> 17:43.647
Still doesn't really answer
my question though, does it?

17:43.730 --> 17:45.482
Who's Led Tasso?

17:45.566 --> 17:49.069
So, our players have contracts that were
signed when we were a premiership club.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.698
But our current income is that
of a championship club. Which means--

17:52.781 --> 17:55.033
You're paying premiership rates
for championship players,

17:55.117 --> 17:56.910
so financially the club's a bit fucked.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.288
Sorry.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.206
She got it quicker than Ted did.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.584
Come in.

18:04.585 --> 18:07.045
Sam! How nice to see you.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.339
-I apologize for interrupting.
-No, please.

18:09.423 --> 18:11.383
Sam, this is my goddaughter, Nora.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.427
-Nora, this is Sam--
-Sam Obisanya.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.262
Hi, Sam Obisanya.

18:16.305 --> 18:18.599
Oh, yes.
You guys used to watch Frozen together.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.684
I have now watched that movie
many times myself.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.770
It's a beautiful metaphor
for many of life's journeys.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.314
Yeah, especially puberty.

18:28.025 --> 18:29.234
What can I help you with?

18:30.027 --> 18:31.028
Well…

18:33.739 --> 18:35.699
I would like to pull out
of my campaign with Dubai Air.

18:38.035 --> 18:39.203
What? Why?

18:39.286 --> 18:43.123
Well, it has come to my attention that
Dubai Air's parent company, Cerithium Oil,

18:43.207 --> 18:45.125
is destroying Nigeria's environment.

18:45.209 --> 18:47.794
And at the same time bribing government
officials to look the other way.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.423
I can't be the face
of one of their subsidiaries.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.050
Hell, yeah.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.886
Look, Keeley, I'm really sorry.
I know how hard you worked for this.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.262
It's okay.

18:57.971 --> 19:00.057
Of course you don't have to do it, Sam.

19:00.140 --> 19:01.433
I'll take care of it.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.268
Thank you.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.270
And lovely to meet you, Nora.

19:06.396 --> 19:07.940
He remembered my name.

19:09.066 --> 19:10.484
They are our sponsor.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.612
We might need to give them a bell
so we don't ruffle any feathers.

19:13.695 --> 19:14.905
I will handle it.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.991
The CEO of Cerithium Oil
is an old friend of Rupert's.

19:19.117 --> 19:21.245
Perhaps he'll still find me charming.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.503
Come here, you.

19:36.134 --> 19:38.011
That's Led Tasso.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.137
Now I get it.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.475
The Ted you know is gone for now.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.189
Now listen up, you little turd birds!

19:49.815 --> 19:51.525
Practice starts at 11 o'clock.

19:51.608 --> 19:54.444
If you are not stretched
five minutes early

19:54.528 --> 19:56.488
then you are 45 minutes late!

19:56.572 --> 19:57.906
You understand me?

19:58.615 --> 20:01.034
Do you understand me?

20:01.118 --> 20:03.453
-Yes, Coach.
-Okay, good!

20:03.537 --> 20:04.913
Now start touching your toes!

20:06.373 --> 20:08.625
Touch your toes!
Those are your feet fingers.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.295
Let's go, dummies. Touch your toes.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.796
And touch each other's toes!

20:12.880 --> 20:14.756
-What?
-You heard me!

20:14.840 --> 20:17.050
Touch each other's toes!
I don't wanna hear it.

20:17.134 --> 20:20.721
Hands on toes.
Someone else's toes besides your own.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.639
-What muscle is this working?
-Don't worry about it.

20:22.723 --> 20:25.976
The only muscle I don't wanna see
working right now is your mouth, Colin.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.896
-Rojas!
-Yes.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.273
-Richard.
-Rojas!

20:33.567 --> 20:35.027
-Bumbercatch!
-Sorry, Coach.

20:35.110 --> 20:36.236
Okay, you're sorry, hey?

20:36.320 --> 20:39.698
I know y'all don't think it's a big deal
messing up on these drills.

20:39.781 --> 20:40.866
But let me tell you this right now.

20:40.949 --> 20:42.910
The day we stop doing things the right way

20:42.993 --> 20:46.330
means we are one day closer
to doing everything the wrong way.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.249
Then what happens after that?

20:49.333 --> 20:52.002
What, you wanna make
this ball your girlfriend?

20:52.085 --> 20:54.254
You gonna start taking it
to places under your arm?

20:54.338 --> 20:56.632
Having people compliment
how y'all look together?

20:56.715 --> 20:57.966
And then what?

20:58.050 --> 21:00.844
You start caressing it and playing with,
like, the little air hole nub?

21:00.928 --> 21:03.013
Yeah? Messing around with that?
Making out with it.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.390
Making it your girlfriend.
Is that what you wanna do?

21:05.474 --> 21:07.309
Then when? You ask it to marry you?

21:08.435 --> 21:11.855
-Y'all wanna be married to a ball?
-No.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.818
-What did you say?
-I said no.

21:16.902 --> 21:18.237
Congratulations, Isaac.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.491
That smart mouth of yours just earned you
and the entire team ten laps.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.368
-Let's go!
-What are you--

21:24.451 --> 21:27.412
Guess what? Make it a thousand laps.
That's your fault too.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.581
A thousand laps. Off you go!
Let's go. Run.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.709
-What did we do?
-Run, run, run. Run! Run!

21:32.793 --> 21:34.670
Yeah, there you go.

21:34.753 --> 21:37.130
Get them knees up!
Get 'em by your nipples!

21:37.214 --> 21:42.010
I hope y'all drank a lot of water today
'cause y'all are gonna be so dehydrated,

21:42.094 --> 21:46.014
that you're gonna look like one of them
trees from a Tim Burton movie.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.059
I'm talking any Tim Burton movie!

21:50.060 --> 21:51.186
Even Dumbo!

21:52.521 --> 21:53.897
Even freaking Dumbo.

21:55.899 --> 21:58.402
Rebecca, what a lovely surprise.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.195
Hello, Richard.

22:00.279 --> 22:03.156
So, are you in your second,
third or fourth house?

22:04.241 --> 22:06.994
I'm actually back on the yacht.
Care to join me?

22:07.077 --> 22:09.204
I don't think your new wife
would enjoy that.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.790
As long as she can watch,
she doesn't mind.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.918
Okay, Richard, I need to ask you a favor.

22:15.002 --> 22:17.462
One of our players, Sam Obisanya,

22:17.546 --> 22:20.549
no longer wishes to participate
in a Dubai Air ad campaign.

22:20.632 --> 22:23.886
And I was hoping you'd be able
to make that go away without much fuss.

22:23.969 --> 22:27.264
Understood, Rebecca.
That won't be a problem.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.349
Excellent. Thank you so much, Richard.

22:29.433 --> 22:32.311
Of course. And now, darling,
I just need a favor from you.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.314
Okay. But nothing scandalous, yes?

22:35.397 --> 22:38.650
Of course not. Get rid of him.

22:38.734 --> 22:41.528
-I'm sorry?
-Get rid of Obisanya.

22:42.654 --> 22:45.115
Thank you, my dear.
Lovely talking with you.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.327
-It's on the left!
-Richard, Richard!

22:48.410 --> 22:50.162
-Richard! Richard!
-Right! Right!

22:51.997 --> 22:52.998
Richard!

22:53.081 --> 22:54.208
I haven't seen a pass that soft

22:54.291 --> 22:56.585
since my high school drama teacher
asked me to mow his lawn.

22:57.586 --> 23:01.131
Is anybody on this pitch
interested in not sucking at soccer?

23:01.215 --> 23:03.759
All right, Coach. We get it.
Just stop yelling at everyone.

23:04.927 --> 23:07.596
I don't know whatever this Jekyll and Hyde
thing you got going on

23:07.679 --> 23:08.972
but just leave it out, yeah.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.974
Okay. Okay.

23:11.058 --> 23:14.061
You know what, Tartt?
Practice is canceled.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.438
Hit the showers.
All of you. Let's go. Run.

23:16.522 --> 23:18.357
Jamie just blew
y'all's chance to get better.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.193
-Thanks, man.
-That's how running looks. Let's run!

23:21.276 --> 23:23.695
Let's go! Everybody to the showers!

23:23.779 --> 23:26.657
Well, guess what?
We start no people this weekend.

23:26.740 --> 23:28.700
It'll be 11 versus zero.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.995
What's the matter, O'Brien?
Your butt still hurt?

23:34.081 --> 23:35.290
Unbelievable.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.418
What?

23:42.214 --> 23:43.215
How long was I out?

23:43.298 --> 23:45.092
-Doesn't matter. You're back now.
-Okay.

23:45.801 --> 23:47.386
Well, that was interesting.

23:48.512 --> 23:49.721
Thank you, Doc.

23:49.805 --> 23:52.558
Yeah, little something
we came up with back in Kansas.

23:52.641 --> 23:55.269
-See, what we're doing is--
-You pretend to be an asshole.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.771
So the team make you their common enemy
and not Jamie.

23:58.981 --> 24:01.358
-Yeah. Spot on.
-Oh, yeah. Got it right away.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.609
Has it ever worked?

24:05.153 --> 24:06.905
-Trying to remember.
-Chuck E. Cheese?

24:06.989 --> 24:08.073
Chuck E. Cheese. That's right!

24:08.156 --> 24:11.493
Yeah, we were at a arcade/pizza joint
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

24:11.577 --> 24:14.454
And one of our offensive linemen
got his head stuck in a VR machine.

24:14.538 --> 24:18.000
Ended up getting the entire meal and
all our beverages comped for free, so…

24:19.751 --> 24:21.128
Maybe they don't have
Chuck E. Cheese here.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.171
Oh, yeah.

24:22.254 --> 24:23.714
Y'all might call it
something different here.

24:23.797 --> 24:26.508
Like Charles Edgar Cheeserton III
or something, right?

24:27.801 --> 24:31.138
-He's a mouse but he's also a musician.
-And he loves video games and pizza.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.431
I'm sure.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.851
Okay, we could release Sam.
Which we're not gonna do.

24:35.934 --> 24:36.935
Oh, no.

24:37.019 --> 24:40.814
Or we can tell the CEO
of our biggest sponsor to piss off.

24:40.898 --> 24:42.024
Which I doubt we can do.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.152
Yeah. This is just like the time
I got in trouble

24:45.235 --> 24:47.154
for chewing gum in the bathroom.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.447
You got in trouble for chewing gum?

24:48.530 --> 24:50.991
No, I was smoking.
But I don't want a lecture.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.076
I'll allow it. Go on.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.662
I was with my friend Sarah,
who we call "Pimp",

24:55.746 --> 24:57.372
when a teach came in and busted her.

24:57.456 --> 25:00.375
I was hiding in the loo
and I could have just stayed there

25:00.459 --> 25:01.960
but he started to get
a bit shitty with her.

25:02.044 --> 25:06.256
So, I decided to come out and
we both ended up getting suspended.

25:06.340 --> 25:10.385
Mum freaked out and I had to watch
a three-hour video about cancer.

25:11.470 --> 25:14.223
Point is, Aunt Stinky,

25:14.848 --> 25:19.478
sometimes you have to do the right thing
even if you lose.

25:20.229 --> 25:21.230
Yes.

25:22.314 --> 25:23.732
Yes, you do.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.528
Hi, Jamie.

25:28.111 --> 25:29.112
Hi.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.406
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.665
Actually, Sam just quit the Dubai Air gig.
So I'm scrambling a bit.

25:39.748 --> 25:40.916
That's stupid of him.

25:42.084 --> 25:43.335
Do you want me to do it?

25:43.418 --> 25:44.795
What do you want, Jamie?

25:45.379 --> 25:47.965
Well, just wanted to talk.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.925
About what?

25:50.008 --> 25:52.845
I'm just super frustrated

25:52.928 --> 25:55.430
'cause I don't know how to let the team
know I'm cool now,

25:55.514 --> 25:57.599
and it's just really fucking with me head.

25:58.809 --> 25:59.935
Walk with me.

26:00.811 --> 26:01.854
Come on.

26:03.564 --> 26:05.858
I mean, if they wanna be little bitches

26:06.358 --> 26:09.862
about actually having someone on the pitch
who can score a goal, then what?

26:09.945 --> 26:12.197
Am I supposed to just walk around
with me head down?

26:14.157 --> 26:15.158
No.

26:15.242 --> 26:17.327
It's like they're holding onto
some silly grudge.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.371
I mean, it's not my fault I'm special.

26:21.456 --> 26:22.708
-Hi.
-Hi.

26:22.791 --> 26:25.836
Jamie, this is Dr. Fieldstone.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.088
She's a brilliant therapist

26:28.172 --> 26:32.050
and, unlike me, she actually gets paid
to listen to you complain.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.062
So, what? Do I just…

26:44.897 --> 26:47.316
sit here and blather on and on
about meself?

26:48.275 --> 26:49.443
Basically.

26:51.028 --> 26:52.029
Nice.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.406
Hey, dick hole.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.908
"Dear Richard Cole."

26:55.991 --> 26:57.993
You creepy old pedo.

26:58.076 --> 27:00.120
"My old friend."

27:00.204 --> 27:02.372
Sam isn't going anywhere, asshole.

27:02.456 --> 27:05.209
"I have decided
not to release Sam Obisanya."

27:05.292 --> 27:07.961
You're a shitty old man
with a tiny, shriveled penis.

27:08.045 --> 27:11.256
I feel sorry for your wife.
Her life must be a constant hell.

27:11.340 --> 27:13.217
"Please give Daphne my love."

27:13.300 --> 27:15.636
Sincerely, boss ass bitch.

27:15.719 --> 27:18.555
"Sincerely, boss ass bitch."

27:25.354 --> 27:26.939
Welcome to Soccer Saturday.

27:27.022 --> 27:31.068
We have a massive afternoon of action
for you today across all the divisions.

27:31.151 --> 27:35.489
I'm your host, Jeff Stelling here with
Mr. Unbelievable himself, Chris Kamara.

27:35.572 --> 27:39.368
A man who's coached seemingly
every club in England, including yours,

27:39.451 --> 27:41.036
George Cartrick.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.872
And still getting comfortable
in his new seat on our set,

27:43.956 --> 27:46.959
it's the legendary Chelsea hard man,
Roy Kent.

27:47.042 --> 27:48.252
Welcome, Roy.

27:50.754 --> 27:51.839
Well said.

27:51.922 --> 27:54.758
Of course,
last time we saw Roy Kent on the pitch

27:54.842 --> 27:58.637
was with AFC Richmond,
battling against relegation.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.640
And occasionally against
other Richmond players.

28:01.723 --> 28:03.267
What is this?

28:03.350 --> 28:05.477
Kent and Tartt
are at each other's throats!

28:08.814 --> 28:12.568
Well, the big story today is the return
of that same teammate.

28:12.651 --> 28:15.112
The controversial Jamie Tartt.

28:15.195 --> 28:19.783
The ex-Manchester City starlet
and Lust Conquers All reject

28:19.867 --> 28:22.077
has his first match back with Richmond.

28:22.661 --> 28:23.787
Any thoughts, Roy?

28:24.413 --> 28:25.873
Jamie Tartt is a muppet.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.543
And I hope he dies of the incurable
condition of being a little bitch.

28:31.170 --> 28:32.754
Right.

28:32.838 --> 28:34.173
Don't hold back, Roy.

28:34.256 --> 28:36.008
Yeah, come on.
Tell us how you really feel.

28:36.091 --> 28:37.801
Okay. You're a shit manager.

28:37.885 --> 28:39.386
Not about me, you twat!

28:39.469 --> 28:40.888
Language, boys!

28:40.971 --> 28:42.973
-Well, he asked for it.
-He did ask for it.

29:05.871 --> 29:07.915
Bantr's horrifying, is it?

29:08.415 --> 29:12.377
I'm going to insult something and then
try it because I'm a good friend.

29:14.046 --> 29:16.048
A-hootie hoo.

29:16.131 --> 29:17.299
Sassy!

29:17.382 --> 29:19.176
I thought you weren't coming back
till Sunday?

29:19.259 --> 29:23.222
What? And miss 22 fit, sweaty men
running around chasing one another?

29:24.431 --> 29:26.099
Did you meet Sam Obisanya?

29:26.183 --> 29:28.644
-That's her favorite player.
-Oh, Mum.

30:11.687 --> 30:12.938
What are you doing?

30:13.564 --> 30:15.065
What, Dubai Air not paying you enough?

30:16.400 --> 30:19.486
No, no. Dubai Air is owned
by a horrible company.

30:20.279 --> 30:23.448
One that has turned the southern coast
of Nigeria, my home,

30:23.532 --> 30:26.159
into a hellish, fiery swamp.

30:28.245 --> 30:29.913
I can no longer wear their name
on my chest.

30:31.456 --> 30:32.583
Never again.

30:39.423 --> 30:40.632
Give me the tape, bruv.

30:50.601 --> 30:51.810
Can I ask it?

31:01.278 --> 31:04.031
Hey, listen.
I do not expect you all to do this.

31:05.365 --> 31:08.243
But I hope you understand
why we as Nigerians must.

31:18.962 --> 31:20.088
Throw me the tape?

31:26.428 --> 31:27.930
What do you think you're doing?

31:29.389 --> 31:30.432
We're a team, ain't we?

31:31.892 --> 31:33.185
Gotta wear the same kit.

31:44.071 --> 31:47.741
Live from the Dogtrack,
it's Arlo White here with Chris Powell.

31:47.824 --> 31:51.662
Today Coventry City take on
the home team, AFC Richmond,

31:51.745 --> 31:54.790
who remain winless
with eight straight draws.

31:54.873 --> 31:56.041
Any predictions, Chris?

31:56.625 --> 31:59.586
-Yeah, I think it's gonna be a draw.
-Makes sense.

31:59.670 --> 32:03.257
But the story everyone is talking about
is the return of Jamie Tartt.

32:03.340 --> 32:06.426
Chris, will the Richmond faithful
welcome him back?

32:06.510 --> 32:09.847
Tough to say, Arlo.
Supporters are a notoriously fickle bunch.

32:09.930 --> 32:11.306
Jamie Tartt

32:12.391 --> 32:15.727
Jamie Tartt
Jamie Tartt

32:15.811 --> 32:18.438
If no one's passing to Jamie
we can always drop him to midfield.

32:18.522 --> 32:21.316
So the people not passing to Jamie
can be closer to him?

32:32.995 --> 32:34.204
-Cheers.
-Thanks, mate.

32:42.921 --> 32:43.922
What's that now?

32:51.513 --> 32:53.015
What's going on here, Arlo?

32:53.098 --> 32:55.475
It appears to be
some sort of protest

32:55.559 --> 32:58.478
against Richmond's sponsor, Dubai Air.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.565
This might become an issue.

33:14.828 --> 33:16.413
Boss ass bitch.

33:25.005 --> 33:27.716
Hey. Easy. Easy.
Hey, take it easy, all right?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.134
One at a time, please. Okay.

33:29.218 --> 33:30.427
Go ahead, Gary, what have you got?

33:30.511 --> 33:32.304
Yeah, Ted, did you know the team
were gonna do that?

33:32.387 --> 33:33.805
No, sir. No, no.

33:33.889 --> 33:36.850
But I think what Sam and the team
did today was courageous.

33:36.934 --> 33:39.603
I've never needed to have
that kind of courage.

33:39.686 --> 33:43.482
'Cause, well, honestly when bad things
happen to people like me

33:43.565 --> 33:46.652
y'all have a tendency to write about it
without being asked.

33:46.735 --> 33:49.071
Sam had to go and get y'all's attention,
you know?

33:50.030 --> 33:53.200
So, if you have any more you wanna know
about it, you can ask him.

33:53.283 --> 33:54.576
Come on, Sam.

33:54.660 --> 33:58.121
Sam! Sam! Sam!

33:59.748 --> 34:00.999
Hello.

34:02.501 --> 34:04.878
Thank you. Trent Crimm, The Independent.

34:04.962 --> 34:07.381
Sam, do you think that your protest

34:07.464 --> 34:10.342
may have distracted the team tonight
and lead to the loss?

34:11.552 --> 34:13.719
I'm not here to talk about football.

34:14.346 --> 34:16.473
I'm here to ask the Nigerian government
to put an end

34:16.556 --> 34:19.226
to decades of environmental destruction
caused by Cerithium Oil.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.813
Destruction that the powers that be
have turned a blind eye towards

34:22.896 --> 34:24.231
for far too long.

34:26.608 --> 34:28.150
Do you have any questions about that?

34:28.235 --> 34:30.027
Yes, I do.

34:30.112 --> 34:31.321
Follow-up question, please. Thank you.

34:31.405 --> 34:35.826
Sam, are you openly accusing
the Nigerian government of corruption?

34:37.995 --> 34:39.371
Yes, I am.

34:39.454 --> 34:40.664
Sam!

34:47.420 --> 34:50.632
-How are you feeling?
-Good. I think.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.635
I just hope the rest of the team
is not upset with me.

34:54.803 --> 34:57.973
Hey, doing the right thing
is never the wrong thing. Yeah.

35:00.142 --> 35:01.268
There he is!

35:04.188 --> 35:06.398
-What's going on?
-We are celebrating!

35:06.481 --> 35:09.026
-But we lost.
-Yeah, but we broke the tie streak.

35:12.404 --> 35:13.822
A toast to Sam,

35:13.906 --> 35:15.449
who did something incredible tonight.

35:15.532 --> 35:17.618
The little Nigerian prick
stole my thunder.

35:20.412 --> 35:22.289
No, but seriously. To Sam.

35:23.123 --> 35:24.499
To Sam!

35:25.292 --> 35:26.877
-Thank you, guys.
-Well done, bruv.

35:27.711 --> 35:30.255
-I appreciate it.
-Took a lot of courage, man.

35:30.923 --> 35:33.342
-It's good to have you back.
-Yeah, it's good to be back, bruv.

35:33.425 --> 35:34.927
Please don't do this to me.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.929
'Scuse me, chaps.

35:37.012 --> 35:40.015
-Sam, could Nora get a picture, please?
-Hello.

35:40.098 --> 35:41.350
Oh, yes! Of course.

35:41.433 --> 35:44.186
Hey, guys! Guys!
We're gonna take a picture for Nora.

35:45.687 --> 35:46.813
I want to be in the front.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.443
Nora, you all right?

35:51.527 --> 35:53.070
-You okay? Yeah?
-Yeah! Yeah.

35:53.153 --> 35:55.822
-She's gonna absolutely love this.
-Oh, my God. Look.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.074
Love it and hate it.

35:57.908 --> 35:59.076
So cute!

35:59.159 --> 36:00.744
Hide your beers!

36:00.827 --> 36:02.162
Oh, shit.

36:02.746 --> 36:03.747
Thank you.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.291
Greyhounds on three! One, two, three!

36:06.375 --> 36:08.418
Greyhounds!

36:11.213 --> 36:12.297
Okay, got it!
