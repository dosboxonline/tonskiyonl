02:28.810 --> 02:30.810
Hello.
My name is Violet.

02:31.110 --> 02:33.400
And I was born into a world you

02:33.500 --> 02:35.500
may not understand.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.110 --> 02:46.000
Coming up. Holding air speed.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.690
Echo: altitude forward, and lateral direct.

02:48.790 --> 02:50.690
Numbers falling fast from here.

02:50.790 --> 02:51.800
On my mark.

02:51.900 --> 02:54.300
3...2...1...

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
Mark.

03:18.900 --> 03:20.900
Hard Lock -- engaged.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.820
Valves -- primary and secondary.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.320
Amazden pressure breach.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.410
Amazden

04:20.399 --> 04:21.511
Freeze.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.653
It's a trap.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.436
Stay where you are.

04:24.462 --> 04:25.571
Don't move.

04:30.399 --> 04:31.675
All hands down.

04:31.701 --> 04:32.975
All clear sir.

04:33.614 --> 04:35.089
Touch nothing.

04:35.188 --> 04:37.188
Obviously.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.998
Hemophages. No surprise.

04:50.628 --> 04:52.490
Flat-space technology.

04:52.589 --> 04:54.248
Dimension compressing.

04:54.350 --> 04:55.969
Very rare.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.170
It's odd.

04:57.269 --> 04:59.089
What was their exit strategy?

04:59.188 --> 05:01.688
How did they expect to transport the blood out of here?

05:01.790 --> 05:03.610
Unless there was no exit strategy.

05:03.709 --> 05:04.850
Then what's the point?

05:04.950 --> 05:06.671
Well -
- what if they didn't come to take the blood out?

05:06.770 --> 05:08.968
What if they came to infect it?

05:09.070 --> 05:10.170
My God.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.270
Ross.

05:16.350 --> 05:18.350
Poor bastard.

05:22.510 --> 05:27.610
Yes. I was born into a world you may find hard to understand.

05:27.709 --> 05:30.230
The trouble began when an American weapons lab discovered

05:30.329 --> 05:32.902
an obscure virus that had been around for centuries.

05:34.110 --> 05:37.290
They tried to modify it, to create faster and stronger soldiers.

05:37.688 --> 05:41.205
But instead, they created a more contagious form of the disease.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.550
A strain called HGV.

05:43.550 --> 05:45.198
Hema Gophagic Virus.

05:45.224 --> 05:48.355
And that's when the disease got out.

05:48.429 --> 05:50.429
Everything changed.

05:50.628 --> 05:53.649
As previous ages were defined by terrorism

05:53.748 --> 05:57.510
this one was defined by fear of disease.

05:57.510 --> 06:00.615
The medical establishment took it upon itself to protect its public.

06:00.950 --> 06:05.050
At first, requiring victims to wear identifying armbands

06:05.149 --> 06:08.809
and rounding them up in special camps and facilities.

06:08.908 --> 06:10.570
Until finally

06:10.670 --> 06:13.475
people just stopped hearing from them.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.450
The trouble began for me the day I learned I was pregnant.

06:16.550 --> 06:19.188
The same day I lost my husband

06:19.188 --> 06:22.628
my future, my life.

06:23.070 --> 06:25.570
I contracted the disease and lost my baby.

06:25.670 --> 06:29.408
With those few on the outside I formed a resistance.

06:29.510 --> 06:33.248
Went underground -
- and began fighting back.

06:35.790 --> 06:38.390
And so began the blood wars.

06:39.589 --> 06:44.171
And now, the leader of the militant medical
establishment, running this phobic world

06:44.270 --> 06:47.700
Is Vice-Cardinal Ferdinand Daxis.

06:48.188 --> 06:50.334
Vice-Cardinal, as you know, our campaign

06:50.434 --> 06:52.890
against the hemophages has been highly effective.

06:52.990 --> 06:55.803
We've managed to eradicate almost all of them. But sir,

06:55.903 --> 06:58.770
the few that are left have proven incredibly determined.

06:58.869 --> 07:02.089
Terrorist attacks are at their highest level ever.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.446
It's not because they're determined

07:04.550 --> 07:05.929
it's because they're desperate.

07:06.028 --> 07:09.890
Because they know we're on the verge
of wiping them out completely.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.218
For the last 10 years, in partnership with laboratories

07:13.317 --> 07:14.570
for latter-day defence

07:14.670 --> 07:16.602
I've overseen the development of a weapon

07:16.701 --> 07:19.128
that can locate and kill every hemophage on the planet

07:19.230 --> 07:20.341
in a matter of days.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.755
Is there an E.T.A. sir?

07:21.830 --> 07:23.830
Now.

07:25.950 --> 07:28.782
A courier is retrieving it to bring here to the Arch-ministry

07:28.868 --> 07:30.162
as we speak

07:52.830 --> 07:55.528
XPD-154: Clearance Classified Courier.

07:56.123 --> 07:57.662
I'm expected.

07:59.188 --> 08:02.809
Reverse-engineered DNA identification: in process.

08:02.908 --> 08:04.615
Remove your head covering.

08:12.567 --> 08:14.192
Remove your eye covering.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.907
Preliminary verification: substantiated.

08:46.589 --> 08:47.787
Please.

08:49.506 --> 08:51.105
Have a seat.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.170
Mind if I ask what's on the menu?

09:10.269 --> 09:11.769
The usual:

09:12.909 --> 09:16.409
Retinal testing to detect the presence of existence of contacts or dives.

09:16.508 --> 09:19.050
Metabolic sensing to make certain your metabolism is

09:19.149 --> 09:21.589
within human range.
Pulse.

09:21.589 --> 09:23.008
Respiration.

09:23.110 --> 09:26.425
Just have to make sure you're -- human.

09:35.469 --> 09:37.318
If you really were a hemophage

09:37.368 --> 09:38.154
we would have already detected

09:38.256 --> 09:40.821
tissue repair at a micro-cellular level.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.568
So

09:58.868 --> 10:01.086
what would happen if one were to fail any of these tests?

10:01.190 --> 10:02.329
Nothing good.

10:02.430 --> 10:06.308
Please remove all articles of clothing, and proceed into the scanner.

10:35.589 --> 10:39.860
Your clothing and personal items have been sterilized, XPD-154.

10:49.188 --> 10:51.206
May I ask you a question?

10:52.105 --> 10:53.079
Feel free.

10:53.573 --> 10:54.771
Do you know what this about?

10:54.870 --> 10:55.761
Should I?

10:56.217 --> 10:58.068
No. It's highly classified.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.003
But I 've been cleared to debrief you, because your consciousness

11:01.100 --> 11:04.581
of the gravity of the situation may increase your motivation to complete.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.600
I've never failed to complete.

11:11.068 --> 11:13.584
The hemophages are a dying species, on the verge

11:13.685 --> 11:14.490
of non-existence.

11:14.589 --> 11:17.610
We have developed weapon that will push them past that brink

11:17.709 --> 11:18.893
into extinction.

11:19.042 --> 11:20.420
If this weapon is so important

11:20.529 --> 11:22.409
Why not have it delivered by armored convoy?

11:22.607 --> 11:25.407
The armored convoy you refer to is departing the facility as we speak.

11:25.508 --> 11:27.485
The hemophages will do anything in their power

11:27.584 --> 11:28.907
to stop and immobilize it.

11:29.006 --> 11:30.344
It is of course a decoy.

11:31.589 --> 11:33.008
XPD-154

11:33.110 --> 11:35.448
You'll be receiving a case, containing a weapon.

11:35.550 --> 11:37.089
I don't have to tell you.

11:37.190 --> 11:40.050
Under no circumstances should you open it.

11:40.347 --> 11:41.347
You're right.

11:43.190 --> 11:44.399
You don't have to tell me.

11:52.268 --> 11:53.214
Identify.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.777
XPD-154: Clearance Classified Courier.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.683
Copy XPD-154: you will be Ven-secting.

12:14.350 --> 12:16.948
Everything in order, XPD-154?

12:21.266 --> 12:22.863
100%, Commrade Doctor.

12:53.547 --> 12:56.086
You're quite certain, everything is in order?

12:56.779 --> 12:57.578
Positively.

12:59.068 --> 13:01.490
Empty your DNA to confirm receipt.

13:01.886 --> 13:04.646
I can only confirm receipt of the container, not its contents.

13:04.847 --> 13:06.045
That's acceptable.

13:15.948 --> 13:18.889
Opening the case is strictly forbidden, you understand this.

13:19.284 --> 13:20.162
Perfectly.

13:20.269 --> 13:24.190
The contents are set to self-destruct in event of non-delivery, in

13:26.084 --> 13:28.162
exactly 9 hours from now.

13:40.430 --> 13:43.149
What is your condition, XPD-154?

13:43.399 --> 13:45.198
Are you functional?

13:55.396 --> 13:57.938
XPD-154, Clearance Classified Courier.

13:58.185 --> 13:58.797
Get on the ground.

13:58.909 --> 14:00.206
On your knees! On your knees!

14:00.409 --> 14:00.766
Get down.

14:00.818 --> 14:02.191
What the hell is going on?

14:02.290 --> 14:04.399
You were entered and processed through this gate 15 minutes ago.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.568
Then it wasn't me, you dumb son of a bitch.

14:06.868 --> 14:09.047
Check my ID. You gotta mite!

14:09.399 --> 14:13.719
I repeat XPD-154. Are you functional?

14:14.066 --> 14:17.193
I don't know what you are talking about
Commrade Doctor, I am 100% functional.

14:18.100 --> 14:20.201
Security breach!
Security breach!

14:20.300 --> 14:21.875
Stand yellow alert!

14:21.901 --> 14:23.640
Stand yellow alert!

15:03.698 --> 15:05.152
Intercept. Intercept!

15:05.178 --> 15:06.630
Inner defense wall!

15:06.704 --> 15:08.680
Unarmed intruder. Unarmed intruder!

16:03.310 --> 16:05.156
How did the hemophage get past the screens?

16:05.256 --> 16:05.803
We don't know sir,

16:05.906 --> 16:09.042
maybe meta-suppressants to subordinate the blood characteristics.

16:11.709 --> 16:13.508
All security to their stations!

16:16.381 --> 16:17.975
All security, report to their stations!

16:48.529 --> 16:49.745
How did she do that?

16:49.795 --> 16:52.310
She must have some sort of gravity leveler.

16:52.409 --> 16:53.722
Well, whatever it is, it's out now.

16:53.748 --> 16:54.330
She's not going

16:54.406 --> 16:55.690
to make it out of this complex alive.

16:55.790 --> 16:57.790
Sir, we've ID'd her.

16:57.800 --> 16:58.946
Plague victim.

16:59.248 --> 17:01.912
She was confined to this facility for experimentation

17:02.013 --> 17:02.899
until she escaped,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.031
after the forced termination of her pregnancy

17:05.131 --> 17:05.928
12 years ago.

17:06.823 --> 17:08.317
Violet Sangt-Jacques Sheriff.

17:08.343 --> 17:09.372
Tell me I'm wrong!

17:09.594 --> 17:10.261
You're wrong.

17:10.867 --> 17:12.666
Why are you doing this?

17:12.803 --> 17:14.599
Because I hate humans

17:14.756 --> 17:16.688
with every fiber of my being.

17:16.990 --> 17:18.964
I'll kill every single one of them,

17:19.662 --> 17:21.490
almost as quickly as they'll try and kill me.

17:22.256 --> 17:23.244
You used to be human!

17:23.344 --> 17:24.541
But not anymore, right?

17:25.380 --> 17:27.568
I got sick, and now I'm something less than human.

17:28.063 --> 17:28.834
Something

17:29.527 --> 17:30.823
worthy of extermination.

17:30.922 --> 17:32.376
It's academic now, isn't it?

17:32.506 --> 17:34.224
You won't make it out of here with that case.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.329
Watch me.

17:50.667 --> 17:51.719
She's there on the ceiling!

17:51.817 --> 17:52.714
Shoot! Shoot!

19:05.230 --> 19:05.813
It's me.

19:06.110 --> 19:06.907
Did you get it?

19:07.506 --> 19:08.204
Yeah.

19:09.350 --> 19:11.239
But they're serious about not letting me keep it.

19:11.932 --> 19:12.369
Fine.

19:12.678 --> 19:15.021
The objective is the destruction of the weapon.

19:15.521 --> 19:17.969
If you can't make delivery -- destroy it.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.891
Copy that. Will terminate and destroy.

19:20.990 --> 19:21.791
No, V.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.667
The attack on the blood bank failed --
You cannot!

19:24.969 --> 19:27.896
Under no circumstances can you look inside that case!

19:27.999 --> 19:31.902
If you are compromised, you must destroy it immediately! Read?

19:32.207 --> 19:33.006
Read.

22:41.558 --> 22:43.829
V.
What the hell is going on?

22:43.928 --> 22:44.527
I'm clear.

22:44.823 --> 22:46.886
I told you to destroy the weapon.

22:47.579 --> 22:48.876
I said I'm clear.

22:51.266 --> 22:52.183
You have the case?

22:54.285 --> 22:55.083
Affirmative.

22:55.183 --> 22:55.980
Bring it in.

22:56.573 --> 22:57.386
What's your status?

22:57.782 --> 22:59.876
The needle. In the Shinwago.

23:03.980 --> 23:05.001
10 minutes.

24:59.886 --> 25:01.021
Bravo, V.

25:01.615 --> 25:02.115
Bravo.

25:02.214 --> 25:04.011
No one but you could have pulled this off.

25:05.428 --> 25:06.146
It's not a weapon.

25:07.334 --> 25:08.532
What are you talking about?

25:08.947 --> 25:11.066
It's not a weapon, it's a child.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.151
A human child.

25:12.225 --> 25:13.683
You opened the case?

25:14.084 --> 25:15.579
What difference does it make?

25:16.381 --> 25:18.360
I risked my life for nothing.

25:23.506 --> 25:26.079
I think I had to know what I was willing to die for.

25:34.745 --> 25:35.823
You see?

25:36.626 --> 25:37.260
Nothing.

25:37.558 --> 25:38.058
Nothing.

25:38.157 --> 25:39.157
It's not a weapon.

25:39.745 --> 25:40.943
It's a child.

25:41.463 --> 25:45.172
It's both. It's a weapon and a child.

25:45.485 --> 25:50.485
Its blood is swarming with cultured antigens that would kill all of us!

25:50.485 --> 25:51.407
On contact.

25:52.094 --> 25:55.084
If they atomize its tissues into the atmosphere.

25:55.297 --> 25:57.448
It would be like insecticide, to people.

25:57.964 --> 25:59.426
Like you and me.

25:59.526 --> 26:00.684
It would find us.

26:00.710 --> 26:02.343
And, it would kill us.

26:03.318 --> 26:04.558
All of us.

26:06.562 --> 26:10.162
Nerver, wait, if there's an accelerator for HGV this child's blood

26:10.562 --> 26:13.061
Then, so's the counter-analogue for decelerating it.

26:13.261 --> 26:15.702
What are you saying V.?

26:15.702 --> 26:17.181
A cure?

26:18.181 --> 26:21.603
Wouldn't it be better than infecting innocent people?

26:21.702 --> 26:24.582
This child could provide the choice.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.893
If there's choice, V --

26:25.919 --> 26:27.343
I have already made it.

26:28.620 --> 26:29.896
It's a child.

26:33.016 --> 26:36.078
You can go now, your work is done.

26:56.178 --> 26:58.136
It was a protection.

26:59.136 --> 26:59.980
Don't ever think it

27:00.006 --> 27:01.578
- - it just turns out I was right.

27:01.604 --> 27:03.186
We're gettin' the hell outta here.

27:15.094 --> 27:17.157
She went up! So go after her.

27:17.256 --> 27:20.379
The Blood-she-more control the top10 floors of this building.

27:20.980 --> 27:22.600
Whatever they want --

27:22.698 --> 27:23.557
give it to them.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.136
Watch me.

30:51.265 --> 30:51.962
Hey.

30:54.817 --> 30:57.011
What are you doing up there, huh?

30:59.334 --> 31:00.334
Hey.

31:03.635 --> 31:05.511
It's a nice view, huh?

31:07.896 --> 31:10.579
Why don't you -- uh

31:10.678 --> 31:14.511
help me up so I can see it too?

31:16.735 --> 31:20.011
Here. Give me your hand.

31:23.610 --> 31:25.490
Give your hand.

31:25.896 --> 31:26.664
Help me up.

31:26.690 --> 31:27.317
Come on.

31:37.011 --> 31:37.751
It's okay.

31:43.911 --> 31:45.544
What do you think you're doing, huh?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.114
You trying to get yourself killed?

31:48.275 --> 31:48.874
Come on!

32:18.469 --> 32:19.172
Stop it!

32:19.308 --> 32:23.896
Seal the building. Any other 'Phages inside
I want them hunted down and killed.

32:24.212 --> 32:26.292
Violet Sang-Jacques Sheriff.

32:29.709 --> 32:31.469
Easy, Violet.

32:32.073 --> 32:33.891
Do you know who I am?

32:34.395 --> 32:36.079
How could I not?

32:36.105 --> 32:38.420
Tyrant. Egomaniac.

32:38.891 --> 32:39.611
Narcissist?

32:39.637 --> 32:41.994
That about sums it up, doesn't it?

32:42.475 --> 32:44.834
Yes it may be true, I

32:44.834 --> 32:46.893
may have quirks -- but that

32:46.919 --> 32:48.876
doesn't mean I'm stupid.

32:48.876 --> 32:53.593
And it certainly doesn't mean that you make a
single move, without me knowing about it.

32:53.593 --> 32:55.489
You would have killed me a long time ago.

32:55.579 --> 32:58.547
Listen.
The boy is useless to you, he's --

32:59.277 --> 33:01.169
laboratory bred. Vegatative.

33:01.195 --> 33:02.770
Practically brain-dead.

33:02.796 --> 33:04.277
Just give him to me.

33:04.277 --> 33:05.584
And you're on your way.

33:05.677 --> 33:09.068
And then you can use him to kill me and everybody like me.

33:10.688 --> 33:11.985
He's not what you think.

33:12.089 --> 33:12.886
No?

33:14.089 --> 33:15.849
What is he then?

33:18.692 --> 33:20.469
He's my son.

33:29.027 --> 33:30.183
Hey Daxis.

33:30.287 --> 33:30.985
What?

33:31.985 --> 33:33.609
You're full of shit.

33:38.105 --> 33:39.526
Cover your ears!

33:40.126 --> 33:41.126
Cover your ears!

33:43.402 --> 33:45.402
Metro 5 is boarding

33:51.443 --> 33:52.636
Stand clear

33:52.735 --> 33:54.032
Doors closing

33:57.761 --> 34:01.162
Damaged?
Are you damaged!?

34:22.505 --> 34:24.318
What am I doing?

34:30.206 --> 34:30.909
Hey!

34:32.786 --> 34:34.998
Park it!
Right there!

34:38.786 --> 34:41.725
Don't make me have to tell you twice.
. . .  Sit!

34:54.581 --> 34:56.801
Don't get any cute ideas, either.

34:57.506 --> 35:00.325
The only reason I saved your life

35:00.429 --> 35:03.442
is because whatever's in your blood can save mine.

35:03.950 --> 35:07.148
If they corner us, suffer no delusions.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.127
I will kill you.

35:20.308 --> 35:20.908
Damn it!

35:20.934 --> 35:22.091
S-Squadron entering station

35:22.117 --> 35:23.358
-- contain and search train

35:24.107 --> 35:25.506
Metro 5 is boarding

35:27.306 --> 35:29.767
Garth, it's me. I screwed up!

35:29.793 --> 35:31.405
I screwed up bad.

35:31.785 --> 35:33.766
The case had a kid in it.

35:33.866 --> 35:35.081
I crossed Nerva.

35:35.107 --> 35:36.625
I know. He called.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.797
Don't even think about bringing it here V.

35:38.898 --> 35:41.297
Damn it Garth, this kid might have the answer in him.

35:41.506 --> 35:44.554
And I'm just gonna be lucky to get him out of here alive.

35:47.066 --> 35:48.116
I need your help!

35:48.392 --> 35:49.130
I'm sorry V. . . .

35:49.156 --> 35:51.781
My research is too important to jeapordize for a single child.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.568
Goodbye V.

36:07.162 --> 36:10.326
What part of those bullets whizzing by your head didn't you get?

36:12.545 --> 36:15.200
Do you understand anything I'm saying to you?

36:18.825 --> 36:22.027
Okay. Let's start simple.

36:22.710 --> 36:24.503
They had to call you something, right?

36:24.529 --> 36:25.447
Do you have a name?

36:26.027 --> 36:26.865
I'm Violet.

36:26.891 --> 36:28.870
Hi, pleased to meet you.

36:28.943 --> 36:30.777
Your turn. Go.

36:43.527 --> 36:45.483
Six.

36:46.683 --> 36:48.243
You.

36:51.943 --> 36:53.700
We gotta go.

36:54.585 --> 36:56.064
Dammit!

37:01.169 --> 37:03.106
Gimme your arm.

37:06.881 --> 37:08.922
Give your arm!

37:10.127 --> 37:11.389
Now you listen to me, Six.

37:11.415 --> 37:12.725
Or whatever your name is.

37:12.797 --> 37:15.773
I might not be able to get you where I want
you to go, but I sure as hell am going to

37:15.870 --> 37:16.901
get your blood now.

37:16.927 --> 37:19.695
Now gimmie your arm before I take the whole thing!

37:20.908 --> 37:23.006
You think those people are bad?

37:23.606 --> 37:25.339
Well let me tell you something.

37:25.443 --> 37:29.142
The real monster, you don't want knocking down your doors, mate.

37:30.827 --> 37:32.818
If I scream

37:34.130 --> 37:36.006
we'll both be dead.

37:50.108 --> 37:53.422
Daxis doesn't know you can speak, does he?

37:56.361 --> 37:58.525
What do you know about what's going on?

38:01.443 --> 38:03.658
There's a war going on to the death

38:03.860 --> 38:06.520
between humans and hemophages.

38:06.546 --> 38:09.205
And Six, you're human -- and

38:10.693 --> 38:12.672
I'm a hemophage.

38:13.860 --> 38:14.975
Wait!

38:15.078 --> 38:15.716
Listen!

38:15.742 --> 38:18.291
Do you remember I said that there was something in your blood

38:18.360 --> 38:19.870
that could save my life?

38:19.985 --> 38:20.791
Well -- Daxis.

38:20.817 --> 38:22.675
He put something into your blood.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.066
He grew something there.

38:24.522 --> 38:27.402
And whatever that is, those antigens,

38:27.704 --> 38:31.152
They may hold the key to saving my life,
but they were put there first and foremost

38:31.256 --> 38:32.693
to kill me.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.819
To kill me, and everyone like me.

38:36.627 --> 38:40.067
So . . .  these men?

38:40.568 --> 38:43.045
Yeah, Six.

38:43.045 --> 38:46.506
They're after you.   Right now --

38:46.808 --> 38:49.981
you're the most valuable object on this planet.

38:55.527 --> 38:56.534
Unbelieveable, V.

38:56.560 --> 38:59.166
You jeapordize everything, by coming here.

38:59.443 --> 39:01.059
The humans want me.

39:01.152 --> 39:02.653
Nerva wants me.

39:04.058 --> 39:06.804
I don't have any place left to go, Garth.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.443
Besides

39:11.245 --> 39:13.398
You have all my guns.

39:15.607 --> 39:17.825
So what's his story?

39:21.264 --> 39:23.225
You tell me.

39:47.189 --> 39:48.496
Can you make an assessment?

39:48.522 --> 39:50.166
-- I'll need to draw some blood.

39:50.245 --> 39:52.137
It'll take a few hours.

40:04.003 --> 40:08.524
Sweeper Team A, inform ArchmMinister Daxis
we have the remaining hemophages cornered

40:08.621 --> 40:10.318
on the 21st floor.

40:13.182 --> 40:14.922
they're right beghind me.

40:14.948 --> 40:15.852
The lights!

40:24.066 --> 40:26.295
Go night-vision. Take them apart.

40:30.527 --> 40:33.881
Switching to emergency backup lighting system.

41:22.108 --> 41:25.460
So . . . are you going to kill me?

41:34.464 --> 41:36.318
Think you can?

42:05.225 --> 42:09.272
I think you and I have matters of mutual self-interest to discuss.

42:25.829 --> 42:27.327
Sit down.

42:34.079 --> 42:36.402
Humans are celebrating something.

42:52.183 --> 42:54.200
Where is this?

42:59.022 --> 43:01.058
When I was a kid,

43:01.162 --> 43:03.985
and I was just a little girl

43:05.002 --> 43:08.673
I used to dream about this old, dusty road.

43:10.100 --> 43:14.075
And this road would go on, as far as the eye could see.

43:15.879 --> 43:17.517
And there was

43:17.725 --> 43:20.977
all these little white flowers growing around the edges,

43:21.485 --> 43:24.496
and it was such a -- peaceful place.

43:26.725 --> 43:28.975
There was a happy place.

43:29.683 --> 43:32.225
But then, you realize,

43:32.325 --> 43:34.881
when life settles in around you

43:34.981 --> 43:36.981
places like this

43:37.566 --> 43:39.402
don't exist.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.439
You're dying.

43:51.839 --> 43:55.518
Yeah. I am.

44:01.022 --> 44:02.735
I'm sorry.

44:08.464 --> 44:10.245
Do  you read?

44:13.045 --> 44:15.839
Allright. Look.

44:20.263 --> 44:22.058
Commrade.

44:24.860 --> 44:26.558
Lover.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.089
Life.

44:34.393 --> 44:36.335
And this one.

44:36.831 --> 44:39.516
This . . .
This one was gonna save mother.

44:39.617 --> 44:43.898
But, I got sick and
and . . .

44:45.202 --> 44:48.154
all that became impossible.

45:25.757 --> 45:27.735
You're not lookin' so good.

45:28.441 --> 45:30.356
I need to transfuse you.

45:30.433 --> 45:33.933
Just be thankful you didn't convert with light sensitivity too.

45:42.972 --> 45:44.767
You do this?

45:46.370 --> 45:47.862
What is it?

45:48.012 --> 45:50.058
I'm not sure.
It looks

45:50.674 --> 45:52.589
chemical...  But,

45:52.683 --> 45:55.850
it seems to be done in the pre-collapsed form of Western notation, so

45:55.950 --> 45:58.360
it was -- probably him.

46:00.068 --> 46:02.013
What is he?

46:02.110 --> 46:04.299
I know what he's not.

46:05.517 --> 46:09.741
He's not someone who has a single molecule of vampire antigen in his blood

46:09.835 --> 46:11.464
that's what he's not.

46:11.568 --> 46:14.162
He's not someone who's any good to us.

46:14.991 --> 46:17.559
We can't reverse-engineer a cure out of his blood.

46:17.658 --> 46:18.548
What?

46:18.648 --> 46:21.358
And if that's not bad enough, the kid's hot, Violet --

46:21.464 --> 46:22.723
practically radioactive.

46:22.749 --> 46:24.583
He's got a tracking device in him

46:24.662 --> 46:26.745
that's accurate to about 100 meters.

46:26.845 --> 46:28.745
We're shielded in here.

46:29.152 --> 46:31.162
I don't understand

46:31.266 --> 46:34.345
why would Nerva want me to get him so badly?

46:34.548 --> 46:36.662
And why were the humans guarding him so closely?

46:37.069 --> 46:39.069
I don't know.

46:39.829 --> 46:42.601
But whatever they did put in the kid, Violet -

46:42.627 --> 46:43.746
- It's killing him.

46:44.766 --> 46:48.089
Some kind of aggressive antagonistic protein.

46:48.392 --> 46:50.117
Very predictible decay.

46:50.143 --> 46:53.218
It's got a shelf-life of about 8 hours.

46:55.152 --> 46:58.235
The kid's toast, V.

47:21.668 --> 47:23.141
Why are you doing this?

47:23.167 --> 47:24.447
He's just a child.

47:24.527 --> 47:26.485
It's a human child, Garth.

47:26.585 --> 47:27.783
And besides

47:27.877 --> 47:29.943
what you're doing here is too valuable to jeapordize.

47:31.454 --> 47:33.451
Goodbye Garth.

47:36.172 --> 47:38.183
You've got a tracking device in you.

47:38.287 --> 47:41.558
We've got to get moving before it locks on. Come on.

48:12.006 --> 48:15.087
Daxis!
My phone number changes every 60 seconds.

48:22.845 --> 48:25.652
Disposable phone printing thank you

48:30.767 --> 48:35.018
Garth it's me. I think they've been
tracking my phone, better get moving.

48:35.121 --> 48:36.180
--  Okay.

48:36.277 --> 48:37.179
Violet?

48:38.381 --> 48:40.818
Maybe it's me.

48:42.485 --> 48:43.620
Come on!

48:51.911 --> 48:53.902
Violet, wait!

48:54.110 --> 48:56.121
What are we doing?

48:59.224 --> 49:01.997
I would be neglecting my duties

49:02.100 --> 49:05.059
If I didn't get a growing-boy fat --
wouldn't I?

49:06.225 --> 49:09.341
Credit card. Allright, so you take this over there

49:09.641 --> 49:11.964
And see if you can't find us something to eat.

49:21.390 --> 49:23.087
Go on.

49:29.350 --> 49:30.350
Six.

49:32.847 --> 49:35.558
You should, uh, really

49:37.518 --> 49:39.777
put your mask up.

49:43.985 --> 49:45.970
Goodbye, Violet.

50:16.158 --> 50:19.158
It's urgent response team moving out

50:34.943 --> 50:36.943
Squad One: we got a visual

50:54.839 --> 50:56.777
What am I doing?

51:29.827 --> 51:31.182
It's not him.

51:31.208 --> 51:33.084
secure lock down

51:33.662 --> 51:36.585
Initiate area quarantine procedures

51:48.189 --> 51:49.262
Six!

51:51.710 --> 51:52.866
Wait.

51:54.366 --> 51:55.168
Six !!

51:56.068 --> 51:57.360
Sorry, V.

52:22.206 --> 52:24.684
Violet Sang-Jacques Sheriff.

52:25.284 --> 52:27.360
What are you thinkin'?

52:27.464 --> 52:30.266
Not bletchin' war.

52:33.964 --> 52:36.206
We're as fast as you.

52:36.308 --> 52:38.547
We are as strong as you.

52:39.245 --> 52:40.818
Yeah

52:41.318 --> 52:42.318
But

52:44.064 --> 52:46.902
Are you one tenth as pissed off as I am?

53:26.210 --> 53:28.079
Careful, V.

53:28.189 --> 53:31.319
Gunfire will attract the human security teams.

53:31.725 --> 53:35.287
You might win the battle, but you'd lose the war, V.

53:39.183 --> 53:40.183
V, wait.

53:44.585 --> 53:47.610
Don't you realize what this child has in him?

53:48.007 --> 53:50.266
I don't care what this child has in him.

53:50.669 --> 53:52.683
It's not a vampiral antigen.

53:53.389 --> 53:55.621
But a human antigen.

53:56.622 --> 53:59.933
Lethal enough to kill every human on the planet.

54:01.547 --> 54:04.444
Why would humans create a human antigen?

54:04.547 --> 54:07.944
What do I -
- or even you care why?

54:07.944 --> 54:11.668
Daxis has offered us a most tempting proposal.

54:11.668 --> 54:14.547
One that would finally even the odds for us.

54:14.547 --> 54:16.991
So just walk away V.

54:17.191 --> 54:19.402
Walk away.

54:55.908 --> 54:57.714
Are you insane?

54:58.014 --> 54:59.473
You won't drop him.

54:59.499 --> 55:01.802
You need him more than I do.

55:02.689 --> 55:03.922
Enter.

56:19.787 --> 56:21.375
What did they . . .

56:21.401 --> 56:23.072
put in me, Violet?

56:32.772 --> 56:34.772
Don't you see?

56:35.827 --> 56:37.994
That mechanism... Daxis --

56:38.020 --> 56:40.437
your father put inside you,

56:41.223 --> 56:45.943
it's a . . . antagonistic protein, it's very precise, and

56:50.006 --> 56:52.439
It's going to shut you down, Six.

56:54.527 --> 56:57.329
It's going to kill you Six,

56:57.629 --> 57:00.766
if I don't find some way if I don't find some

57:01.568 --> 57:04.664
I just need some time, just need

57:11.705 --> 57:12.714
Hello Violet.

57:12.918 --> 57:13.918
3-D me.

57:16.691 --> 57:17.985
This is a surprise.

57:18.089 --> 57:20.787
I want you to take out whatever you put in the kid.

57:21.189 --> 57:24.464
Oh, I wish that was possible, but there is no cure for the antigen.

57:24.766 --> 57:26.221
I don't believe you.

57:26.318 --> 57:27.818
Just bring him to me.

57:28.016 --> 57:31.641
The antigen dies with the boy, and neither of them are any good to anybody.

57:32.346 --> 57:35.543
You said you were his father, for godsake.

57:35.746 --> 57:36.985
No, Violet.

57:39.389 --> 57:40.784
I don't have a father.

57:41.184 --> 57:43.610
No?
More precisely

57:47.006 --> 57:47.905
he's my clone.

57:47.931 --> 57:50.113
Number six in a series of eight.

57:50.381 --> 57:53.228
What...?
What the hell difference does it make?

57:53.254 --> 57:54.854
He's a child, you monster.

57:54.931 --> 57:55.726
Monster?

57:56.829 --> 57:57.773
And, what you?

57:57.799 --> 58:01.547
And, more importantly, what does that make him to you?

58:01.547 --> 58:05.589
Some sort of bizarre maternal surrogate?

58:07.350 --> 58:10.797
A vampire and a dying human child

58:11.502 --> 58:14.110
what a pathetic picture.

58:14.110 --> 58:16.259
I'll make you another Violet.

58:16.285 --> 58:17.989
One that's not broken

58:18.068 --> 58:20.891
You won't even be able to tell the difference.
I promise.

58:20.985 --> 58:25.027
And I may even be able to help you with
that problem you have in your own blood.

58:25.423 --> 58:26.016
Trace.

58:26.120 --> 58:28.920
Why track the call, I'll tell you where I am,

58:29.221 --> 58:31.481
I want you to bring me the boy.

58:31.579 --> 58:34.964
I'll bring you a lot more than that, you prick.

58:35.464 --> 58:38.423
I have 700 soldiers here with me.

58:38.527 --> 58:42.183
What do you really think you can do against that many men?

58:43.691 --> 58:45.691
I can kill them.

58:50.382 --> 58:51.484
Arch-ministry.

58:51.510 --> 58:53.635
Let's go meet your maker.

59:01.017 --> 59:02.507
Auto guide on

59:13.507 --> 59:15.412
You can't make it in.

59:16.023 --> 59:18.787
Thanks for the vote of confidence.

59:20.889 --> 59:23.064
Haven't you been paying attention?

59:23.963 --> 59:25.955
Killing is what I do.

59:26.868 --> 59:28.745
It's what I'm good at.

59:31.544 --> 59:34.637
Hey . . .
I'm a Titan.

59:36.299 --> 59:38.037
A monolith.

59:40.025 --> 59:41.673
Nothing can stop me.

59:44.515 --> 59:45.882
I can see it.

59:47.481 --> 59:49.637
What the hell choice do I have?

59:51.388 --> 59:52.985
A very clear one.

59:55.418 --> 59:57.481
To watch me die.

59:58.486 --> 01:00:00.391
Or make me

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:03.360
watch you do the same.

Are you mental?

01:00:32.574 --> 01:00:33.774
The antidote.

01:00:35.564 --> 01:00:38.056
I told you, there is no cure.

01:00:38.465 --> 01:00:40.983
You wouldn't create a human-lethal antigen without an antidote you could

01:00:41.068 --> 01:00:42.068
administer to yourself!

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.767
And your man-ciples.

01:00:45.006 --> 01:00:46.543
Very nice, Violet.

01:00:47.244 --> 01:00:49.293
Well, yes.
There is an antidote.

01:00:49.319 --> 01:00:49.958
And yes,

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:53.205
when I get the boy, isolate the antigen and release it into the atmosphere

01:00:53.308 --> 01:00:56.808
anyone who wants to live will cue up daily at this door to get it.

01:00:57.617 --> 01:00:59.568
I thought we were the ones you hated.

01:00:59.964 --> 01:01:02.360
I thought we were the ones you were trying to wipe out!

01:01:02.662 --> 01:01:04.522
That's problem.
You were.

01:01:04.548 --> 01:01:05.589
Past tense.

01:01:05.964 --> 01:01:09.258
But now that you, and those like you are all but extinct

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.606
what's someone like me, someone with a job to do

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:15.825
going to use -- to keep order in a society that left to itself

01:01:16.025 --> 01:01:18.014
would sprint toward chaos like an olympic event.

01:01:18.619 --> 01:01:20.410
We did our job too well.

01:01:21.016 --> 01:01:23.495
Now -- must we make amends.

01:01:23.993 --> 01:01:26.006
You disgust me.

01:01:26.314 --> 01:01:28.339
It's a relative term, Violet.

01:01:28.537 --> 01:01:30.460
Give me what I want.

01:01:31.265 --> 01:01:32.762
Come and get it.

01:01:48.361 --> 01:01:50.137
You won't have him.

01:01:57.985 --> 01:02:00.043
Projection disruption

01:02:14.785 --> 01:02:16.762
There's just too many, V.

01:02:19.204 --> 01:02:21.002
Just too many.

01:03:04.402 --> 01:03:05.433
Six

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:11.737
Violet -
I'm here.   I'm here.

01:03:17.387 --> 01:03:19.183
What's that sound, V?

01:03:20.758 --> 01:03:22.689
V, what's that sound?

01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:27.111
That's just the wind.

01:03:28.913 --> 01:03:30.797
Just the wind.

01:04:06.866 --> 01:04:08.318
Too late, he's gone.

01:04:08.517 --> 01:04:10.942
Quarantine the corpse, get it to the Arch-ministry.

01:04:11.043 --> 01:04:13.054
Maybe we can salvage something out of it.

01:04:13.152 --> 01:04:14.452
And her, sir?

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:34.689
Have an incendiary team sanitize the area immediately.

01:04:35.893 --> 01:04:38.815
All personnel, prepare to leave the area Get the body on ice.

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:40.112
Prepare it for disassembly.

01:04:40.384 --> 01:04:42.473
We go in for salvage at daybreak.

01:04:42.499 --> 01:04:43.297
Yes, doctor.

01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:45.454
All personnel, clear the area immediately

01:04:47.461 --> 01:04:48.189
Violet.

01:04:51.082 --> 01:04:51.799
Violet.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:55.211
Violet.

01:04:59.957 --> 01:05:00.756
Violet.

01:05:06.747 --> 01:05:08.047
Ga...  Garth...

01:05:09.066 --> 01:05:12.878
You very thoughtfully subbed in for the incendiary team.

01:05:13.379 --> 01:05:16.672
Your heart stopped three times, but after four hours of surgery

01:05:16.773 --> 01:05:18.172
and a lot of prayer

01:05:19.298 --> 01:05:21.360
We managed to save your life.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.069
You what?

01:05:29.778 --> 01:05:30.736
Careful.

01:05:33.788 --> 01:05:36.287
I was there, Garth.

01:05:36.313 --> 01:05:38.022
I was there.

01:05:38.299 --> 01:05:40.811
You brought me back.

01:05:41.616 --> 01:05:43.101
And for what?

01:05:43.611 --> 01:05:46.174
So I can do it all over again?

01:05:49.274 --> 01:05:50.370
Why?

01:05:51.772 --> 01:05:56.272
Isn't it -- isn't it obvious?

01:06:06.497 --> 01:06:09.403
Why won't you ever let anyone in?

01:06:10.297 --> 01:06:11.360
Because

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:16.910
these moments

01:06:18.009 --> 01:06:20.888
as beautiful as they are

01:06:22.018 --> 01:06:24.495
they're evil, when they're gone.

01:07:14.257 --> 01:07:17.059
Violet. It's me, Garth.

01:07:17.059 --> 01:07:19.205
Listen: turn on the TV.

01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:22.392
You're all over the place, every channel.

01:07:22.897 --> 01:07:25.356
Listen to me --
Just minutes ago apparently . . .

01:07:25.455 --> 01:07:27.502
I know you're in a bad place

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:31.160
But what the boy wrote down on that piece of paper

01:07:31.278 --> 01:07:34.425
it has something to do with the HGV virus, I know it.

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:35.828
I can feel it.

01:07:36.732 --> 01:07:39.830
Violet, if you can just give me a little more time.

01:07:40.736 --> 01:07:41.873
V?

01:07:42.373 --> 01:07:43.373
Are you listening?

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:52.972
Where are you?

01:07:52.998 --> 01:07:54.523
--- 10th artery, Westbound.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.356
Stay on course, I'll converge in 15.

01:08:18.743 --> 01:08:20.312
Arch-ministry, on approach

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:21.589
Violet, we can't get in there.

01:08:21.615 --> 01:08:22.255
It's impossible.

01:08:22.281 --> 01:08:23.501
Why do you think we went through

01:08:23.578 --> 01:08:27.073
so much trouble to have you intercept
the case before it got back to Arch-ministry?

01:08:27.379 --> 01:08:29.337
I'm aware of that.

01:08:30.344 --> 01:08:34.120
What's the point? Retribution?
The boy is dead!

01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:36.095
He's not dead.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:38.738
What do you mean?

01:08:39.234 --> 01:08:41.336
I mean Six is alive.

01:08:41.849 --> 01:08:44.194
Violet! How can he be alive?

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.308
Wait! Look!

01:08:45.386 --> 01:08:46.957
What the boy wrote down on the paper.

01:08:46.984 --> 01:08:49.009
It's the chemical foundation of what I am certain

01:08:49.078 --> 01:08:51.023
is a cure for hemoglophagia.

01:08:51.122 --> 01:08:54.520
Daxis' researchers probably developed it years ago in the same lab

01:08:54.844 --> 01:08:56.006
that he was bred in.

01:08:56.033 --> 01:08:57.638
Just give me a little time.

01:08:57.663 --> 01:08:58.673
I can cure you.

01:08:59.523 --> 01:09:01.037
I know it.

01:09:38.724 --> 01:09:42.100
The antigen can't survive without a living host.

01:09:42.407 --> 01:09:47.407
However we may be able to salvage some viable basic protein analogues

01:09:47.407 --> 01:09:52.939
that will save us time, in re-culturing the antigen in another clone.

01:10:09.141 --> 01:10:11.965
Searching for ... concealed weapons

01:10:17.843 --> 01:10:20.308
Number of weapons found

01:10:21.702 --> 01:10:22.775
Many!

01:10:22.887 --> 01:10:25.374
I'm here to see, the Vice-Cardinal.

01:10:29.265 --> 01:10:31.960
Yellow Alert!      Yellow alert!

01:10:32.265 --> 01:10:34.764
Yellow Alert!      Yellow alert!

01:10:38.429 --> 01:10:39.291
It's her!

01:10:39.391 --> 01:10:40.391
She's dead!

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:47.877
Oh my god.

01:10:51.457 --> 01:10:56.091
Single female intruder identified in security portal one

01:10:56.903 --> 01:10:58.440
Please remain calm

01:10:59.246 --> 01:11:03.196
pacification and neutralization is underway

01:11:10.272 --> 01:11:11.240
The boy's dead.

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.750
This is pure suicide.

01:12:31.789 --> 01:12:33.991
Yellow alert upgraded

01:12:34.091 --> 01:12:34.891
Orange alert

01:12:35.379 --> 01:12:36.927
One woman against 14 men.

01:12:36.953 --> 01:12:38.066
It's ridiculous!

01:12:38.258 --> 01:12:40.896
Have the gas guard waiting for her in the mortal sciences library,

01:12:40.997 --> 01:12:42.783
I'm going to level her!

01:14:16.704 --> 01:14:17.840
Red alert!

01:14:17.866 --> 01:14:19.229
Red alert!

01:14:20.195 --> 01:14:22.694
Red alert!
Red alert!

01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:40.870
You are all
gonna die.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.364
Is that all you've got?

01:16:10.905 --> 01:16:13.726
Violet -- the boy is dead.

01:16:14.225 --> 01:16:18.198
You obviously don't have a clear grasp of what "dead" really is.

01:16:18.799 --> 01:16:20.711
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.188
For godsakes . . .
Violet --

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.481
I'm unarmed!

01:16:29.679 --> 01:16:30.940
Not yet you're not.

01:16:34.426 --> 01:16:35.822
No!

01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:52.426
You got hemo blood on me.

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:03.200
It is on!

01:17:31.129 --> 01:17:32.311
Yeah it is.

01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:02.502
Yes, no doubt in a fair fight, you would beat me.

01:18:04.391 --> 01:18:07.073
But that's not how I got where I am today.

01:18:20.334 --> 01:18:22.371
Can you see me, Violet?

01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:25.656
No?

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:29.049
Too bad you can hurt with only mild light sensitivity.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.434
Unlike me.

01:18:31.736 --> 01:18:32.731
What?

01:18:32.935 --> 01:18:34.612
That's right, Violet.

01:18:34.731 --> 01:18:37.071
How do you think a lowly lab technician

01:18:37.163 --> 01:18:39.654
Made that meteoric rise through the ranks?

01:18:39.975 --> 01:18:44.973
What accident of providence do you think
gave him those additional qualities?

01:18:45.573 --> 01:18:47.411
Yes Violet.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.620
I'm like you.

01:18:51.102 --> 01:18:52.264
My god!

01:18:52.762 --> 01:18:57.054
With the minor exception that I'm going to walk out of here alive.

01:18:59.062 --> 01:19:00.434
Violet.

01:19:01.836 --> 01:19:02.912
Violet!

01:19:55.175 --> 01:19:57.534
Do you believe in god, Violet?

01:19:59.037 --> 01:20:01.433
Do you hope he's merciful?

01:20:01.533 --> 01:20:06.225
Do you think he'll welcome you, into
his arms, like the so very many

01:20:06.328 --> 01:20:08.328
you've sent his way?

01:20:08.927 --> 01:20:10.912
Hey, Daxis.

01:20:13.105 --> 01:20:14.548
You know, after this

01:20:14.646 --> 01:20:16.646
I think you will.

01:21:01.204 --> 01:21:02.562
Six.

01:21:04.475 --> 01:21:05.788
Six, wake up.

01:21:07.398 --> 01:21:08.455
Violet.

01:21:10.762 --> 01:21:15.328
But -- I thought I was  . . .  dead.

01:21:17.033 --> 01:21:18.074
No.

01:21:36.862 --> 01:21:38.787
You've just been reborn.

01:21:47.019 --> 01:21:48.070
Violet.

01:21:50.722 --> 01:21:51.643
Violet.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.241
Violet!

01:21:57.851 --> 01:21:58.891
It's okay.

01:21:58.993 --> 01:22:00.491
No, it's not.

01:22:00.995 --> 01:22:03.117
Violet listen to me.

01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:07.254
There's a cure.

01:22:08.558 --> 01:22:10.254
Oh. No.

01:22:14.523 --> 01:22:16.315
We found it?

01:22:24.045 --> 01:22:25.012
Come on.

01:22:34.512 --> 01:22:38.513
Yes, I was born into a world you might not understand.

01:22:39.516 --> 01:22:41.928
But a world, as it turns out

01:22:42.436 --> 01:22:45.416
where hope still lives.

01:22:48.558 --> 01:22:53.253
And my body -- will Garth be able to fix it?

01:22:53.354 --> 01:22:55.919
The way another had cured my soul?

01:22:57.122 --> 01:22:58.221
Maybe.

01:22:58.518 --> 01:22:59.820
Maybe not.

01:23:00.926 --> 01:23:06.954
But this I do know: all those still out there who spread oppression

01:23:06.954 --> 01:23:10.325
and "justice" and hatred:

01:23:10.612 --> 01:23:11.966
They better hope not.
