12:19.655 --> 12:20.573
Watch the puddle.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.033
-6,977.
-…977.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.243
That's correct.

12:24.326 --> 12:28.330
One minute you're alive,
and then the next, poof, you're dead.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.041
Forever. That's not what we want, right?

12:31.125 --> 12:34.920
I wanna get home before climate change
ends the world as we know it.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.255
Well, yeah.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.256
Ew, ew.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.968
Secondhand smoke, three o'clock.
Come over here. Stay on this side.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.762
[exaggerated coughing]

12:42.845 --> 12:44.555
You're fine, Uncle Klaus.

12:45.389 --> 12:49.852
Yeah, I know. I… I'm fine.
You'll be fine. We'll all be fine.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.188
[Gus] My name is Gus.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.856
[group] Hi, Gus.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.567
I've been searching for the truth
my whole life.

12:57.860 --> 12:59.153
Then I found this group.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.239
And it was like a lightbulb went off.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.535
For the first time, I heard people
talking about what I was going through.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.789
-[group member 1] Exactly.
-I realized there's nothing wrong with me.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.250
-It's this timeline, man.
-[group member 2] Yeah.

13:13.334 --> 13:15.336
-It's screwed up!
-[murmurs of agreement]

13:15.961 --> 13:18.672
-I know I can come here and say anything.
-Yeah.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.384
I… I could say Sir Reginald Hargreeves
is actually an alien

13:22.468 --> 13:25.721
who is secretly grooming
a cabal of teenage super soldiers,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.891
and all you guys actually know
what I'm talking about.

13:28.974 --> 13:30.684
[group member 3] Keep going.

13:32.102 --> 13:32.937
And now,

13:34.355 --> 13:35.356
I have hope.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.984
'Cause I know a cleanse is coming.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.486
-Yes.
-Amen.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.074
[quizzical, mysterious music playing]

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
Thank you, Gus. Thank you.

13:51.288 --> 13:54.166
How about you?
Got anything you wanna share?

13:56.961 --> 13:57.920
Yeah, sure.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.298
Hi, my name's Jerome.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.300
[all] Hi, Jerome.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.512
I'm still new to all this,

14:06.595 --> 14:10.015
but I can tell you folks,
what you're talking about is real.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.310
[sighs] You're not crazy.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.938
I know because I've been
to other timelines.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.859
I don't look it, but I'm 63.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.446
I spent 45 years
lost in a future apocalypse.

14:25.364 --> 14:28.200
And I was involved
in the Kennedy assassination.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.743
[group member 4] Speak your truth.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.704
[Five] All that's unraveling now.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.832
I don't know what's real
and what's not anymore.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.043
I feel like I can't trust anybody.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.045
[sighs]

14:40.546 --> 14:42.923
All I know is I'm glad
to have found all of you.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.842
[group members mutter supportively]

14:44.925 --> 14:46.385
That's it. That's all I got.

14:46.468 --> 14:47.845
[group leader] It's okay.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.723
Good share.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.895
You wanna hear some real shit, kid?

14:56.687 --> 14:58.355
I'll take you to a real meeting.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.360
[bright harp glissando]

15:03.444 --> 15:05.446
[enigmatic music playing]

15:06.363 --> 15:07.656
[agent] You're late.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.657
I know.

15:09.575 --> 15:10.826
Mustache.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.869
Right.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.790
[agent] He's waiting in his office.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.963
The Keepers function
mainly as a support group,

15:23.047 --> 15:25.341
but with strong cult-like tendencies.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.969
Membership is rapidly growing
across all metro areas in the US,

15:29.053 --> 15:30.012
as well as Europe.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.598
It's all there in my report, sir.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.683
What's the organizing principle?

15:36.560 --> 15:39.480
They believe we're all somehow stuck
in the wrong timeline.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.944
Well… just a bunch of loony tunes,
if you ask me.

15:45.027 --> 15:48.364
Drop this Keeper nonsense. Move on.

15:49.573 --> 15:52.117
I think it's time you got back
to your other cases.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.578
Ladybug, Panama, Chicken Wing.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.915
-Sir, I am making progress with this.
-Now, you listen to me.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.751
You have the makings of a fantastic spook.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.212
A suspicious mind.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.422
A love of complexity and detail.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.051
A certain maturity
that most of my young agents lack.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.514
Play your cards right,
you'll be running this place someday.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.892
Thank you for saying that, sir.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.435
[music swells]

16:18.519 --> 16:19.979
[Luther chuckling]

16:20.062 --> 16:21.230
Hey, buddy!

16:21.855 --> 16:26.860
Ah, it's good to see ya!
How long's it been, huh? About four years?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.779
Minus six months for good behavior.

16:28.862 --> 16:31.782
Well, you better keep that up
now that we're roommates.

16:31.865 --> 16:35.452
The only reason I called you is because
I need a fixed address for my probation,

16:35.536 --> 16:36.954
and the feds seized my apartment.

16:37.621 --> 16:41.083
Well, whatever the reason,
the universe brought us together,

16:41.166 --> 16:42.584
and I think that's fun.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.585
Come on. Let's go.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.848
[Allison] Claire? Klaus?

16:55.931 --> 16:56.932
Anybody home?

16:57.516 --> 16:58.475
Hello?

17:02.563 --> 17:04.857
[reporter on TV]
Another catastrophic weather event.

17:04.940 --> 17:07.776
You do realize
that we have a TV upstairs, right?

17:10.029 --> 17:12.364
Hey, Klaus, are you going
to the thing today?

17:12.448 --> 17:13.490
What thing?

17:13.574 --> 17:16.285
Diego and Lila's thing.
It's little Grace's birthday party.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.911
-Not a chance.
-Please?

17:17.995 --> 17:20.873
I need somebody to take Claire.
She's sleeping over at her cousins'.

17:20.956 --> 17:22.583
-I'm not going.
-Yes, you are.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.419
Allison, attending an all-day event

17:25.502 --> 17:29.715
with problematic family members
and alcoholic beverages?

17:30.424 --> 17:34.386
I mean, that's a one-way ticket
to "Trigger Town, USA," if you ask me.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.388
I'm just gonna stay down here in my room.

17:36.472 --> 17:38.307
Okay. Klaus?

17:38.390 --> 17:39.224
Yes.

17:39.308 --> 17:43.187
You have been sober for three years.
Give yourself a little credit, all right?

17:43.270 --> 17:44.354
You can handle this.

17:44.438 --> 17:49.193
Your faith in me is very undeserved.
But, hey, why don't you take Claire Bear?

17:49.276 --> 17:52.196
I can't. I have a big callback tomorrow.
I need to prepare.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.198
Oh, which one again?

17:54.948 --> 17:57.076
-The Wichita PD pilot.
-[Klaus gasps sarcastically]

17:57.159 --> 17:58.494
Wichita PD.

17:58.994 --> 18:00.162
Sounds gripping.

18:01.163 --> 18:04.458
It's a really big part, Claire,
and it's between me and one other woman.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.461
This is important. I can't keep doing
laundry detergent commercials.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.965
All right. Fine. But you owe me, big-time.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.467
Thank you. Lunch. Come on.

18:14.134 --> 18:14.968
Not hungry.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.637
You never eat.

18:17.471 --> 18:19.139
-Like you give a shit.
-Whoa!

18:19.223 --> 18:20.891
Excuse me! Claire!

18:21.600 --> 18:22.434
Claire!

18:23.685 --> 18:25.813
Would it make you feel better
to remind you

18:25.896 --> 18:28.398
that we were exactly like that at her age?

18:29.483 --> 18:30.359
No.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.195
[eccentric, whimsical music playing]

18:35.572 --> 18:37.074
[brakes screech]

18:37.157 --> 18:39.618
[engine popping, creaking]

18:41.203 --> 18:44.540
-Where the hell are we?
-Come on. I got a surprise for you.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.917
It's a, uh, little welcome-home gift.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.794
[engine clangs]

18:48.877 --> 18:49.920
[steam hissing]

18:53.882 --> 18:55.509
Yeah, don't worry about it.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.804
[chipper electronic music playing]

19:01.974 --> 19:05.018
-No, no, no!
-Oh, come on. Don't be such a sourpuss.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.272
Look, it'll be good for you to reconnect
with the family after all these years.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.607
Hey, this is not my family.
My family's dead.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.859
Remember? The Sparrows?

19:11.942 --> 19:12.901
Fine.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.236
Either come inside,

19:14.319 --> 19:17.322
or I'm gonna tell your parole officer
you missed your curfew.

19:18.365 --> 19:22.286
You have to at least stay for cake.
No one leaves before cake, Ben.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.371
[chipper pop music playing]

19:26.582 --> 19:28.333
Hey, sorry. Excuse me.

19:30.294 --> 19:31.420
What are you doing?

19:31.920 --> 19:34.256
-Cake.
-We haven't even done the piñata.

19:35.090 --> 19:38.385
Piñata first, then cake.
What the hell is wrong with you?

19:40.053 --> 19:43.140
What was it?
A Ponzi scheme? White-collar fraud?

19:43.765 --> 19:44.975
Crypto exchange.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.476
Web 3.0, baby.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.729
Feds only went after me
because I'm an outsider.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.439
A fucking maverick like Elon.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.358
Well, that and you bankrupted
100,000 people.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.776
The whole thing was a witch hunt.

19:54.860 --> 19:58.530
Yeah, well, say what you will.
It's still good to have you back. Cheers.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.868
Ha-ha!

20:02.951 --> 20:04.036
Gotcha!

20:05.537 --> 20:08.540
Come on. It's been years
since we've been together like this.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.792
[Ben] Ever think maybe
there's a good reason for that?

20:10.876 --> 20:12.085
Where's Viktor?

20:12.169 --> 20:14.046
Oh, uh, he said he was coming.

20:14.630 --> 20:18.800
-What about Allison?
-Oh, well, she's usually a no-show, right?

20:19.468 --> 20:21.011
Maybe it's better that way.

20:21.094 --> 20:24.181
[Klaus] Survived another one.
Congratulations, everybody.

20:24.264 --> 20:27.517
All right. Please call me
before you go to bed.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.435
Yes.

20:28.518 --> 20:32.022
Why don't you come on in?
Just for one little slice of cake.

20:32.522 --> 20:34.650
We've already talked about this.
Nobody wants me there.

20:34.733 --> 20:37.236
-That's not true. Not true.
-It is.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.571
-Even if it wasn't, I have lines to learn.
-All right.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.616
Well, I'll tell everybody you said hello.

20:52.751 --> 20:55.754
The money's decent,
and I make my own hours, so there's that.

20:55.837 --> 21:00.175
But my team supervisor is a real dickhead.
He's always riding the stick.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.301
Yeah, that seems tough.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.346
Most importantly,
it's just a waste of my God-given talents.

21:04.429 --> 21:06.640
When do you think
I'll be hearing back from the agency?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.934
-Sorry?
-The CIA, bro.

21:09.017 --> 21:10.936
-You gave 'em my résumé, right?
-Right.

21:11.019 --> 21:13.897
-That's heading up the ladder as we speak.
-That's what I'm talking about!

21:13.981 --> 21:15.857
You told 'em I know multiple disciplines?

21:15.941 --> 21:19.236
Hand-to-hand. Karate. Aikido.
Hapkido. Krav Maga. Jujitsu.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.029
Muay Thai. Kendo. Sambo--

21:21.113 --> 21:23.156
Diego, I let 'em know. I told 'em.

21:23.240 --> 21:27.452
…in a panic, you can't get to,
so that's my new thing I'm trying out.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.079
Hey, whoa! Hold your horses.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.665
Just wait for your Uncle Klaus
to get situated

21:31.748 --> 21:35.043
because right now, it feels like
he's about to hyperventilate.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.088
Hey. Did I forget
to pack my little brown bag?

21:38.171 --> 21:39.548
-Claire! Come on!
-You're fine.

21:39.631 --> 21:43.093
-It's just a six-year-old's party.
-You're right. You're always right.

21:43.176 --> 21:46.638
It's obnoxious. Put that on the table,
and don't touch anything sharp.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.223
[inhales, exhales deeply]

21:48.307 --> 21:49.850

-Klaus?

21:49.933 --> 21:51.727
-Hey, buddy!
-Hey.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.770
Good to see ya! Come here!

[sputtering]

21:54.896 --> 21:57.691
Sorry. Don't touch. Spasibo.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.026
Right, yeah, of course.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.695
He is a germaphobe now
and extremely sober. Hi, Klaus.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.530
Benjamin!

22:03.613 --> 22:04.781
Klaus.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.867
Wha… When did you get out?

22:06.950 --> 22:07.826
About an hour ago,

22:07.909 --> 22:11.371
but I'm strongly considering
robbing a bank to get back in.

22:13.582 --> 22:18.295
Yeah, but just give me a second. Okay.
Hey, let go of her! Sorry, excuse me. Hey.

22:18.879 --> 22:20.672
What are you doing? Just string it up.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.133
You said you were
on the west side this morning?

22:23.216 --> 22:26.720
Yeah. I dropped off the kids,
and I picked up the piñata. So what?

22:26.803 --> 22:28.430
So this is an east side piñata.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.514
Excuse me?

22:29.598 --> 22:31.433
This is clearly an east side piñata.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.435
Check out the craftsmanship, the fringe.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.897
Okay, listen, we needed a piñata,
so I got a piñata.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.942
And right now, we need more soda,
so please, can you hurry up?

22:42.319 --> 22:43.820
Where were you this morning?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.115
Fine. I'll get it myself.

22:48.408 --> 22:50.744
[partygoer] Yeah?
All right. I'll go get her.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.457
Bye, Donnie. Bye, Zack.

[Allison gasps, coughs]

23:21.024 --> 23:22.901
Oh, oh, sorry. I was--

23:22.984 --> 23:25.195
As you were. I just need a minute.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.322
[cheeky instrumental flourish]

23:27.406 --> 23:29.574
Tell me it gets better when they're older.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.953
Tell me it gets easier.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.250
-Once they hit puberty--
-Give me that.

23:49.219 --> 23:52.431
[eccentric, quirky melody playing]

23:52.514 --> 23:53.473
That's better.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.101
[chuckles]

23:58.603 --> 24:00.605
[both laughing]

24:01.940 --> 24:05.444
You coming in, or you just gonna linger
out here like a total psycho?

24:05.527 --> 24:06.778
I can't. I can't.

24:06.862 --> 24:08.530
[Lila] Mmm. Mm-hmm.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.616
-You can.
-No. Nobody wants me in there.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.494
[wheezily] Nobody cares anymore.

24:15.078 --> 24:16.037
I don't.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.123
It would be so awkward.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.418
-They're over it. Let's go.
-No, Lila--

24:21.501 --> 24:23.503
Give me my… Hey! Give me my keys!

24:23.587 --> 24:24.588
Chop-chop.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.257
Come on!

24:27.757 --> 24:28.800
Li… [exhales]

24:31.553 --> 24:34.222
Lila! Gimme my keys!
Please don't make me go in there.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.724
Allison, listen to me.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.268
-No… Nobody likes me here.
-You're being dramatic.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.103
I'm telling you, nobody wants me here.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.856
-Please. You don't understand.
-Trust me, you're fine.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.525
[rollicking chiptune playing]

24:46.109 --> 24:48.278
[Allison] Lila, I'm too stoned for this.

24:49.654 --> 24:50.780
This was a mistake.

24:51.656 --> 24:55.535
You're right. This is incredibly awkward.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.287
Uh…

24:57.996 --> 24:59.289
Hey, uh, Allison!

25:01.541 --> 25:04.294
[awkwardly] Uh… Uh…

25:04.377 --> 25:05.337
Hey!

25:05.962 --> 25:07.464
So glad you made it.

25:07.964 --> 25:08.924
Just…

25:10.175 --> 25:11.927
thought I'd pop in and say hello.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.012
-Hello.
-[Luther] Yeah.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.597
Great.

25:17.432 --> 25:19.601
It's, uh, been a minute, huh?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.520
Since we've…

25:22.479 --> 25:23.355
Yeah.

25:25.148 --> 25:27.067
Yeah. Um…

25:28.610 --> 25:29.819
Is Viktor here?

25:29.903 --> 25:34.324
No, no. He's not here yet,
but, uh, he said he was coming, so…

25:35.033 --> 25:35.867
Yeah.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.453
Okay, see you later.

25:44.626 --> 25:47.837
I mean, you do the job,
even though it's killing you,

25:47.921 --> 25:51.633
and the kids, they suck
whatever energy you have left.

25:51.716 --> 25:52.717
[Luther] Mmm.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.844
And the in-laws, I mean…

25:56.471 --> 25:58.473
I'm glad they're alive in this timeline,

25:58.557 --> 26:01.935
but that don't mean
I want them living in my house.

26:02.018 --> 26:05.063
[gentle, introspective music playing]

26:05.146 --> 26:06.481
And then there's Lila.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.485
You know,

26:11.486 --> 26:14.698
she told me she couldn't get pregnant
while breastfeeding.

26:16.449 --> 26:18.785
You can, by the way.

26:26.543 --> 26:28.503
Diego, come on, man.

26:30.338 --> 26:32.632
Some people would kill
to have what you have.

26:33.133 --> 26:35.218
You know? I mean…

26:38.138 --> 26:40.640
I know Sloane and I
would have killed to have this.

26:43.852 --> 26:44.853
Shit.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.650
You're right.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.485
I'm sorry.

26:53.486 --> 26:56.072
[music swells]

27:06.791 --> 27:08.793
[upbeat music playing faintly]

27:10.920 --> 27:11.921
[Viktor sighs]

27:18.178 --> 27:19.012
Viktor.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.223
[inscrutable music playing]

27:22.307 --> 27:24.351
-Who are you?
-Uh…

27:25.810 --> 27:27.854
I need you to get in the van.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.028
If my father has something to say to me,
he can come say it himself.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.030
[sighs] Please.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.865
I don't wanna hurt you.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.410
I'd really like to see you try.

27:43.536 --> 27:46.331
I just… I really need you
to get in that van.

27:46.414 --> 27:48.625
[dark, overwhelming music playing]

27:49.918 --> 27:50.919
[Viktor grunts]

27:54.422 --> 27:55.799
[music swells, trails off]

27:55.882 --> 27:57.550
Diego, where's the cake?

27:57.634 --> 28:00.011
You said piñata before cake.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.514
That was like two hours ago!

28:02.597 --> 28:05.225
Can we get this show on the road?
I have book club tonight.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.396
One, two, three…

28:09.479 --> 28:10.522
Yeah, Grace!

28:10.605 --> 28:13.692
…four, five, six.

28:13.775 --> 28:14.693
Now go!

28:15.694 --> 28:18.279
[Diego growling playfully]

28:20.156 --> 28:21.950
-Harder!
-A little more.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.034
All right.

28:25.036 --> 28:27.038
All right. That's enough. Good job.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.373
-Good effort.
-Good job.

28:28.456 --> 28:29.708
Come here, birthday girl.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.085
Yes.

28:33.628 --> 28:34.629
[partygoer] Oh!

28:37.215 --> 28:39.300
Wow. They really can't
break that thing, huh?

28:40.343 --> 28:43.263
East side piñatas
are notorious for their difficulty.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.558
Screw this. I'm starving.

28:49.102 --> 28:51.855
Out of the way, kid!
I'll hit you, son of a bitch.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.398
[Luther grunting]

28:53.481 --> 28:54.441
Oh!

28:55.150 --> 28:56.651
Come on! [Luther grunting]

28:58.570 --> 29:00.238
-[heavy blows landing]
-[child screams]

29:01.197 --> 29:02.699
What the… What…

29:02.782 --> 29:05.243
-All right, you asked for it!
-[children screaming]

29:10.165 --> 29:12.500
[muffled audio distortion]

29:16.337 --> 29:17.338
-[splat]
-[kids gasp]

29:18.590 --> 29:20.592
[cheeky, eccentric woodwinds playing]

29:23.928 --> 29:26.306
-[Allison] It's okay, sweetie.
-[Grace] My cake!

29:27.348 --> 29:28.683
What is wrong with you?

29:30.393 --> 29:31.394
I got it open.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.564
[siren wailing in distance]

29:34.647 --> 29:38.276
All right, just be cool, Jerome.
Anybody asks, you're with me.

29:41.237 --> 29:43.740
[partygoer] It's always so good
to see you, Diane.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.784
[indistinct chatter]

29:51.039 --> 29:53.124
[Five's companion]
These are the real Keepers.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.334
Best of the best.

29:55.668 --> 29:56.544
Oh, hey, Renee.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.630
People are talking.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.840
-I'd love to know what you think.
-[scoffs]

30:00.924 --> 30:03.134
[delicate, enigmatic music playing]

30:03.218 --> 30:04.260
Excuse me, Larry.

30:06.137 --> 30:09.265
[Lila] You know Hilary.
She used to know every single thing.

30:09.349 --> 30:10.975
[Five, sotto voce] So this is book club?

30:11.559 --> 30:12.852
[Lila titters]

30:14.103 --> 30:16.064
Will you excuse me just a second?

30:17.398 --> 30:19.692
You blow my cover,
I'll rip your balls off.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.152
You're gonna blow my cover.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.697
Nice mustache, by the way. What are you
supposed to be? A Greek serial killer?

30:24.781 --> 30:28.243
[chuckles] I'll have you know
this is top-of-the-line horse hair.

30:28.326 --> 30:32.247
The real question is,
what are you doing here, "Nancy"?

30:33.331 --> 30:36.251
Let's just say the transition
from full-time assassin

30:36.334 --> 30:40.296
to full-time caregiver to 3 small children
and one chunky husband is no picnic.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.632
I needed to get outside the house.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.635
I saw a sign and took a chance.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.554
It's cheaper than therapy.

30:48.763 --> 30:51.641
But you know, these losers
might be onto something.

30:51.724 --> 30:56.062
If everyone can take their seats,
the presentation's about to begin.

30:57.814 --> 30:58.857
Come on.

31:05.572 --> 31:06.573
[Lila gasps]

31:08.241 --> 31:09.242
Who are they?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.495
You never heard of Gene and Jean?
Sure you're part of the right CIA?

31:12.579 --> 31:14.831
-Just spit it out.
-Okay!

31:15.957 --> 31:20.503
Gene and Jean started
the first chapter in Clovis, New Mexico.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.506
Since then, the movement
has been everywhere.

31:26.175 --> 31:27.010
Wow.

31:27.510 --> 31:28.678
Wowie!

31:29.387 --> 31:31.890
I mean, holy shit!

31:33.516 --> 31:38.021
Pardon my French, but look at
all these beautiful shining faces.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.731
It is too much.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.774
Thank you for being here.

31:42.358 --> 31:48.114
We have a big night planned,
because tonight, we will be discussing…

31:48.990 --> 31:50.325
[music intensifies]

31:50.950 --> 31:52.744
"The Umbrella Effect,"

31:53.620 --> 31:55.788
and how I believe

31:56.623 --> 31:59.751
we can return to a restored…

32:01.753 --> 32:04.339
and correct timeline.

32:07.926 --> 32:13.222
Now, what do we mean
when we talk about the Umbrella Effect?

32:13.306 --> 32:14.265
Well,

32:15.350 --> 32:21.147
some people refer to it
as "timeline sickness."

32:21.230 --> 32:23.232
[disquieting stinger plays]

32:24.734 --> 32:27.946
These artifacts from other timelines…

32:31.199 --> 32:36.955
Like the shared memories
so many of us have experienced, huh?

32:37.038 --> 32:38.331
Yup.

32:38.414 --> 32:42.627
Memories the powers that be
would have you believe

32:42.710 --> 32:46.798
are just figments of our imaginations.

32:48.508 --> 32:53.096
A dapper dandy holding an umbrella,
standing on the grassy knoll.

32:54.138 --> 32:58.267
An obscure sex cult
called "Destiny's Children."

32:59.394 --> 33:03.564
A litter of child superheroes
in short pants,

33:03.648 --> 33:07.110
from which we derive
the name of this phenomenon,

33:07.193 --> 33:09.362
the Umbrella Effect.

33:11.322 --> 33:12.156
[Jean] Question is…

33:14.867 --> 33:17.203
who benefits from covering this up?

33:20.081 --> 33:23.167
The elites, of course.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.502
[knowing murmurs]

33:24.585 --> 33:29.215
The ruling class has always been
threatened by the truth.

33:30.341 --> 33:33.344
But they cannot stop the truth,
now, can they?

33:33.428 --> 33:34.554
[all muttering]

33:35.096 --> 33:37.265
[Gene] No, I didn't think so.

33:38.141 --> 33:41.602
[Jean] These artifacts are proof

33:42.645 --> 33:45.064
that we're living in the wrong timelines.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.066
And they're the key

33:48.860 --> 33:50.695
to bringing about

33:52.572 --> 33:53.865
the Cleanse.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.577
What the hell is the Cleanse?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.704
[whispers] No idea, but shut your mouth.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.539
[Five] Your whisper is very high-pitched.

34:01.622 --> 34:03.249
[Lila] Don't blow our covers.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.751
[Five] You're gonna.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.377
Is there a problem back there?

34:06.461 --> 34:07.462
[Lila] Shit.

34:08.629 --> 34:09.797
I'm sorry.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.384
Could you little Chatty Cathys
stand up, please?

34:13.468 --> 34:15.178
-[Lila] Don't…
-[Jean] I don't…

34:15.261 --> 34:17.472
Can't really see your pretty little faces.

34:20.099 --> 34:23.352
-Oh, Papa, it's Nancy.
-[Gene chuckles]

34:24.103 --> 34:25.396
Hi, everyone.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.357
And who's your little friend?
I don't believe we've met.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.694
-This is my handsome fella--
-Jerome.

34:31.778 --> 34:32.653
Jerome.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.530
From the Orlando branch.

34:34.614 --> 34:35.740
[Jean] Mmm.

34:36.365 --> 34:39.035
Jerome from the Orlando branch.

34:39.118 --> 34:42.663
Looks like your suntan
could use a little work there, Jerome.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.545
Maybe there's something
we could help clarify,

34:49.629 --> 34:52.423
Jerome from the Orlando branch.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.133
No, so, um, sorry--

34:54.217 --> 34:58.012
We were hoping maybe you could elaborate
on the concept of the Cleanse.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.517
Some believe it's the end.

35:07.814 --> 35:11.818
Others believe
it's but a great restoration.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.070
What do you believe?

35:15.404 --> 35:18.324
Well, you're in luck,

35:18.407 --> 35:24.664
because we are preparing
a very special lecture on just this topic.

35:25.289 --> 35:27.375
Aren't we, darling?

35:28.209 --> 35:29.585
That's right, darling.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.880
If you're interested,
give us your information.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.507
Address, phone number.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.344
We'll make sure to send you an invitation.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.555
Both of you.

35:43.349 --> 35:44.350
Thank you both.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.436
So sorry about that.

35:51.524 --> 35:54.777
[Lila] Look, if these artifacts
are from different timelines,

35:54.861 --> 35:56.112
and now they're showing up…

35:56.195 --> 35:59.073
It's possible
the old man's reset didn't take.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.825
What does that even mean?

36:00.908 --> 36:02.160
I have no idea.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.789
Look, whatever this is,
don't say anything to the family just yet.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.833
All right? Not even Diego.

36:08.916 --> 36:11.544
Absolutely not.
He thinks I'm at book club.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.131
It's just easier that way.

36:15.882 --> 36:18.885
All right. Well, it's a good thing
I never got married.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.636
Too much deception involved.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.305
Wow.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.976
Didn't your dad teach
any of you Hargreeves men how to eat?

36:28.102 --> 36:29.145
Wait, no, come here.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.229
[Five scoffs]

36:36.319 --> 36:38.321
[somber, pensive music playing]

36:55.588 --> 36:56.422
Welcome home.

[Ben] What the hell, dude?

37:00.468 --> 37:02.637
You're squatting
in some condemned building.

37:03.137 --> 37:04.722
Condemned? What?

37:05.932 --> 37:08.809
Well, yeah, it's a touch run-down,
I'll give you that,

37:08.893 --> 37:11.604
but come on,
I've put a lot of work into this place.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.482

37:16.525 --> 37:18.236

37:19.320 --> 37:23.074
I, uh… I read a lot of DIY books,
which is tough at first,

37:23.157 --> 37:25.117
but you kinda get a knack for it,
you know?

37:26.160 --> 37:27.161
Check it out.

37:30.665 --> 37:32.250
Ah, let's get a fire going.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.587
Oh, uh…

37:37.463 --> 37:40.925
You should avoid using the toilets
on the second floor.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.978
[Ben] Looks like you got mail.

37:52.061 --> 37:52.895
Huh?

37:52.979 --> 37:55.356
Probably the city
condemning this shithole.

37:55.856 --> 37:58.609
No, no, no, no.
They stick those to the front door.

37:59.819 --> 38:00.778
What's this?

38:10.204 --> 38:11.706
We gotta call the others.

38:12.206 --> 38:14.792
[Five] Okay, Luther, we're here.
What is it?

38:14.875 --> 38:17.920
It says, "Your brother Viktor
has been kidnapped."

38:18.004 --> 38:21.257
"Follow my exact instructions,
and no harm will come to him."

38:23.718 --> 38:26.554
All right. Any idea
on who might be behind this?

38:26.637 --> 38:29.140
-My money's on you-know-who.
-[Klaus] Dad? Come on.

38:29.223 --> 38:33.060
Dad didn't kidnap Viktor.
He doesn't give a shit about us.

It just really hurts

your CIA buddies?

38:39.233 --> 38:42.945
[exhales] Well, the CIA doesn't
investigate kidnappings. That's the FBI.

38:43.029 --> 38:46.282
Wait. Hey, hey, no.
We don't need anyone. We can handle this.

38:46.365 --> 38:47.491
Yeah.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.577
We're not exactly a team anymore, Diego.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.578
Or ever were.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.876
No. I don't care.
If Viktor's in trouble, I'm in, right?

38:59.503 --> 39:01.505

I'm not your mother.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.709
Couldn't make it to your niece's birthday?

40:21.210 --> 40:24.713
Well, I was on the way,
and then I got kidnapped, so…

40:24.797 --> 40:25.881
Yeah, nice excuse.

40:25.965 --> 40:27.216
Diego.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.926
Do you guys wanna untie me, or…

40:29.009 --> 40:30.094
Oh, yeah, sure.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.973
[Ben] Who grabbed you?
Was it Hargreeves and his goons?

No way. This is amateur hour.

And hopefully, my last.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.111
But I need your help.

40:47.194 --> 40:49.864
Well, kidnapping our brother
and pointing a gun at us

40:49.947 --> 40:51.782
isn't gonna buy you much goodwill.

40:52.783 --> 40:56.871
It was the only way I could make sure
that you came here. All of you.

40:57.371 --> 41:00.708
I couldn't leave anything to chance.
Especially when it comes to…

41:02.877 --> 41:04.128
the Umbrella Academy.

41:04.211 --> 41:06.797
[Diego] No one's called us that
in six years.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.677
Sorry, pal.
The Umbrella Academy doesn't exist.

41:12.678 --> 41:13.679
Um…

41:13.762 --> 41:14.972
Okay, but…

41:16.223 --> 41:18.726
[spluttering] Okay, but… Just…

41:20.644 --> 41:22.688
Can… Can you explain this, then?

41:27.193 --> 41:29.028
[Klaus] Umbrella Academy saves what?

41:29.528 --> 41:32.990
When the hell
did we save the Eiffel Tower?

41:33.073 --> 41:34.408
Where did you get that?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.661
It was in this box of things
in the trunk of my daughter's car.

41:37.745 --> 41:38.746
Her name's Jennifer.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.081
-Where did she get that?
-I don't know.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.249
But, okay, listen.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.876
So, about a year ago,

41:43.959 --> 41:46.253
she met these new friends,

41:46.337 --> 41:49.673
and, uh, they started going
to these strange meetings.

41:49.757 --> 41:53.344
They're very strange people.
They call themselves the Keepers, and, uh…

41:53.928 --> 41:55.513
And then, over time,

41:55.596 --> 41:58.224
she stopped talking to me.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.225
Just stopped.

41:59.308 --> 42:02.853
And that was about three months ago,
and I haven't seen her since,

42:02.937 --> 42:06.565
and I believe that something terrible
has happened.

42:06.649 --> 42:09.568
No offense. Maybe she just
wants nothing to do with you.

42:10.361 --> 42:14.448
No, no. My daughter and I are very close.
She would never do this to me.

42:14.532 --> 42:17.284
Wait, hold on. How did you find us?

42:17.368 --> 42:20.412
I saw you on TV. Toss N' Wash.

42:20.496 --> 42:23.374
[triumphantly] Ha! See? No small parts.

42:23.874 --> 42:28.504
I… I've actually been watching you
for quite a while now.

42:29.547 --> 42:30.381
Uh…

42:30.965 --> 42:34.802
And I'm… I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry. I apologize.

42:35.386 --> 42:39.932
Uh, but, I mean,
she's all that I have left, and, uh…

42:40.641 --> 42:42.851
What do you need us for? Call a cop.

42:42.935 --> 42:45.813
I did. They didn't do anything.

42:45.896 --> 42:49.233
We'd like to help, but we're not
the same people in that picture anymore.

42:49.316 --> 42:51.777
Yeah, we don't even have powers now.

42:51.860 --> 42:53.195
Yeah, we're not special.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.947
Speak for yourself, tubby.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.742
Give us 24 hours.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.411
Five, what are you doing?

43:00.494 --> 43:02.955
-24 hours. We'll find your daughter.
-Yes. Thank you.

43:03.539 --> 43:05.874
-Guys, let's go.
-What are you talking about?

43:05.958 --> 43:10.629
Thank you very much, Umbrella Academy.

-What the hell was that, man?

43:17.636 --> 43:19.888
Hey, why are you
considering helping that guy?

43:19.972 --> 43:21.265
-Five.
-[Luther] What's going on?

43:22.182 --> 43:23.100

43:29.481 --> 43:31.400
[tense, uneasy music playing]

43:34.111 --> 43:38.574
What I'd like to know is how the daughter
of some random dry cleaner

43:38.657 --> 43:41.368
ends up with a jar of marigold
in the trunk of her car.

43:41.452 --> 43:44.246
How do we know
that's not just a jar of glow stick juice?

43:44.330 --> 43:46.832
Why don't you take a sip
and find out, tough guy?

43:46.915 --> 43:49.335
-I will if you will.
-Don't even think about it.

43:49.835 --> 43:53.714
Okay, for the sake of discussion,
let's say this is legit.

43:54.465 --> 43:56.300
Does anyone here want their power back?

43:56.383 --> 43:57.885

-Yeah.
