the greatest warriors of all time

55:08.041 --> 55:11.000

they'd never be defeated.

55:12.125 --> 55:14.665
So they chose to become peaceful instead,

55:14.666 --> 55:19.374

in Buddhist meditation as monks.

abandoning some of his technique,

almost fuel more of the fire
than anything else.

01:19:29.458 --> 01:19:30.665

[Amin] A disappointing showing
from Robles,

01:20:52.875 --> 01:20:55.915
as he allows the emotion to overtake him.

01:20:55.916 --> 01:21:00.540
In a sport built on technique,
Anthony Robles went for brute force,

01:21:00.541 --> 01:21:02.957
and the reigning champ
makes quick work of him.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.582
It's okay!

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:07.874

Matt McDonough has won

national championship.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:31.124
you lose like that, that fast,

01:21:31.125 --> 01:21:34.166

a pain like that in a long time.

01:21:36.666 --> 01:21:37.708

01:21:39.833 --> 01:21:41.916
There's no joy without pain.

01:21:43.166 --> 01:21:45.624
There's no success without failure.

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:50.291
Gain and loss,
they're two sides of the same coin.

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:53.207

- Mm-mm.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:55.290

01:21:55.291 --> 01:21:56.790
Nah, not at all.

01:21:56.791 --> 01:21:58.500
Thanks, though.

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:04.583
So why do you do this?

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.249
Why do you wrestle?

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:09.333
- Why do I wrestle?
- Yeah.

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:18.082
'Cause it's the only sport

01:22:18.083 --> 01:22:19.790
where a guy can't run away from me.

01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:21.082
Oh, yeah.

- Yeah.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.750
No, but seriously.

01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:35.583
Why do you do it?

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:43.290
When... when people look at me,

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:46.416
the first thing they see
is what's missing.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:53.582
I got all the way there and I lost.

01:22:53.583 --> 01:22:55.583
Maybe there's...

01:22:59.125 --> 01:23:00.665
...I don't know,

01:23:00.666 --> 01:23:03.207
something missing in me
that I can't see, you know?

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:04.999
- No.
- I mean, Coach,

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.707
most people, even people like you, right?

01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:12.415
They spend their whole lives
trying to achieve their goal.

01:23:12.416 --> 01:23:14.499
No matter how many times
they fall or stumble,

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.957
people are like, you know,

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:19.457
"Get back up. Go again.
Try again. It-it's not over.

01:23:19.458 --> 01:23:21.375
It's not about winning."

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.291
I'm 21 years old, and I have
one more year to achieve my goal.

01:23:30.625 --> 01:23:32.250
After that...

01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:35.915
...get a job and do something.

01:23:35.916 --> 01:23:39.541
I-I don't know.
I'll probably sit at a desk.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:44.540
If I don't win, if...

01:23:44.541 --> 01:23:46.915
if I come in second,

01:23:46.916 --> 01:23:50.958
for the rest of my life, I'll be telling
everybody that I came this close.

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.415
And they'll listen.

01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:57.875
They'll s... they'll smile.

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:05.750
But for the rest of my life,
everyone will just...

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:10.166
...feel a bit sorry for me.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.375
But, Coach, if I win...

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:20.750
...having one leg won't be
the most important thing about me.

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:27.000
I'm running out of time to be someone.

01:46:03.416 --> 01:46:05.791
- [Sparks] And he's got Robles on his back.
- [referee] Two!

01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:09.290
And that top position as well.

01:46:09.291 --> 01:46:10.749
The Hawkeye scores a couple.

01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:12.750
- We got ourselves a new match.
- [whistle blows]

01:46:14.208 --> 01:46:18.666
An exciting first period
in this 125-pound final.

01:46:21.708 --> 01:46:23.749
[mouthing]

01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.290

Stupid bitch, I will beat your ass!

01:46:27.958 --> 01:46:29.999
- [clamoring]
- [Nicholas] Mom, Mom, Mom!

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.707
- How about I break your face?!
- Mom, Mom, Mom.

01:46:31.708 --> 01:46:33.541
Calm down, calm down.

01:46:35.125 --> 01:46:36.249
Green. Your choice.

01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:38.624
[Sparks] The disc comes up to McDonough.

01:46:38.625 --> 01:46:41.750
Takes a look at Tom Brands.
He'll defer. The choice goes to Robles.

01:46:46.875 --> 01:46:49.207
And the Sun Devil Robles
wants to stay neutral.

01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:51.750
- It's okay. I'm sorry.
- [crowd cheering]

01:46:52.958 --> 01:46:54.874
[Sparks] A match characterized
by early discipline...

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:57.915
- Okay. Let's go, Anthony!
- ...descending perhaps into emotion,

01:46:57.916 --> 01:47:01.332
as these two men clearly have
no fondness for one another.

01:47:01.333 --> 01:47:02.415
[whistle blows]

01:47:02.416 --> 01:47:04.457
[Brands] Don't waste time, Matt.

01:47:04.458 --> 01:47:05.999
[Sparks] Second period, tie score.

01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:07.540
[Charles] Get a wrist. Get his wrist.

01:47:07.541 --> 01:47:09.582
- [both straining]
- Clear that!

01:47:09.583 --> 01:47:11.499
Clear that, Anthony!
Clear that! Clear that!

01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.665
[Sparks] McDonough heavy with
those power ties, physicality.

01:47:14.666 --> 01:47:19.290
Doing a nice job taking territory,
moving forward.

01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:21.040
[Brands] Chest to chest, Matt!

01:47:21.041 --> 01:47:24.833
[Sparks] Good pummeling action
going on between these two right now.

01:47:29.166 --> 01:47:31.415
[excited shouting]

01:47:31.416 --> 01:47:33.582

You have to break him!

01:47:42.416 --> 01:47:44.208
[Sparks] Counterattack there from Robles.

01:47:45.291 --> 01:47:47.540
Feeling each other out a little bit
in this second period.

01:47:47.541 --> 01:47:48.832
Don't want to make a mistake.

01:47:48.833 --> 01:47:52.000
You want to be aggressive
but not too aggressive.

01:47:53.833 --> 01:47:55.415
And now McDonough with an attack.
Seat belt position.

01:47:55.416 --> 01:47:57.082
Gonna switch off to a single leg.

01:47:57.083 --> 01:47:58.499
High whizzer from Robles.

01:47:58.500 --> 01:48:00.374
Anthony trying to square his hips.

01:48:00.375 --> 01:48:02.749
Does a really nice job,
but McDonough relentless,

01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:05.457
as they scramble center mat
and Robles kicks out!

01:48:05.458 --> 01:48:07.125
[excited shouting]

01:48:08.791 --> 01:48:10.791
[Sparks] Some good flurries on both sides.

01:48:11.875 --> 01:48:14.915
Great fake by Robles!

01:48:14.916 --> 01:48:17.999
And you see that scrambling ability
from McDonough.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.208
[whistle blows]

01:48:20.583 --> 01:48:22.499
[Kurring] Last year,
Robles made a critical error

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:24.457
going for a ball and chain tilt
on McDonough

01:48:24.458 --> 01:48:26.249
when he was in desperate straits.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:28.207
I expect possibly to see a repeat of that.

01:48:28.208 --> 01:48:30.790
[Sparks] That'd be a mistake
in my opinion, Don,

01:48:30.791 --> 01:48:33.207
because we know McDonough
would certainly be expecting that.

01:48:33.208 --> 01:48:34.957
[grunts]

01:48:34.958 --> 01:48:36.165
- [Brands] Come on, Matt.
- Top.

01:48:36.166 --> 01:48:38.083
[referee] Green chooses top.

01:48:44.208 --> 01:48:45.707
[Charles] Right away, Anthony. Right away.

01:48:45.708 --> 01:48:47.124
[Sparks] Well, this is it.

01:48:47.125 --> 01:48:51.415
A lifetime of dreams and hard work
comes down to these two minutes.

01:48:51.416 --> 01:48:53.874
[crowd murmuring]

01:48:53.875 --> 01:48:55.749
[Brands] We need a point here.
We need a point.

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:58.083
[Sparks] Put your seat belt on, Don.

01:49:00.250 --> 01:49:01.499
- [referee] Set.
- [whistle blows]

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:02.999

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:04.500
Pressure forward.

01:49:07.166 --> 01:49:08.540
[Charles] All right.
Come on, son. You good.

01:49:08.541 --> 01:49:10.957
[Sparks] McDonough really good
in this top position.

01:49:10.958 --> 01:49:12.374
Good forward pressure.

01:49:12.375 --> 01:49:15.332
But credit Robles staying active
and busy on bottom.

01:49:15.333 --> 01:49:17.832
You don't want to get caught
underneath McDonough.

01:49:17.833 --> 01:49:19.375
He'll make you pay.

01:49:20.958 --> 01:49:22.499
Working hard for that top position.

01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:23.665

Fight here! Fight here!

in this 125-pound final.

01:49:35.083 --> 01:49:38.374
[Sparks] Robles looking to avenge
the loss from last year's final.

01:49:38.375 --> 01:49:41.166
And there's an escape takedown!
Another for the Sun Devil!

01:49:44.625 --> 01:49:46.165
And diving right back into
the single leg of McDonough.

01:49:46.166 --> 01:49:48.457
[Brands] Get him off your leg,
off your leg!

01:49:48.458 --> 01:49:49.957
