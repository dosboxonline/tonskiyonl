you fell off your horse...

40:52.409 --> 40:53.911
...drunk, of course.

That means you boys can read.

42:07.484 --> 42:13.324
That means you saw the signs outside

But like you told young Andy...

42:19.205 --> 42:22.291

Not really, Bill.

wouldn't worry you, would it?

Or better, if you don't hear it.

One was on a dun and another
was on a flea-bitten gray.
