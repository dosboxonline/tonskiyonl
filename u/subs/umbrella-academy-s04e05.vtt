[rapid gunfire]

47:51.618 --> 47:52.953
[Keeper] Got 'em pinned!

47:53.036 --> 47:55.622
[dramatic, forceful music playing]

47:56.290 --> 47:57.749
[Keeper] Take 'em out!

47:57.833 --> 48:00.002
Get in the car! Get in the car!

48:03.589 --> 48:04.423
[yells]

48:29.948 --> 48:31.199
What's going on?

48:31.283 --> 48:32.659
Stay the fuck down!

48:32.743 --> 48:35.245
[Keepers screaming]

48:36.538 --> 48:38.248
[dramatic, urgent music building]

48:42.878 --> 48:44.171
Start the car!

48:46.506 --> 48:48.383
[engine turns over, revs]

48:49.051 --> 48:50.385
[Viktor] Go, go, go, go!

49:06.276 --> 49:08.278
[music trailing off]

49:14.493 --> 49:15.410
You okay?

49:16.870 --> 49:19.414
You tore my suit
when you threw me into the car.

49:22.960 --> 49:23.877
Bill me.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.754
[somber, thoughtful music playing]

49:27.255 --> 49:30.467
I can't speak to how
the other Hargreeves saw you,

49:31.343 --> 49:32.260
but…

49:33.220 --> 49:36.014
it was wrong of him
to treat you the way he did.

49:38.266 --> 49:41.520
It is now abundantly clear
to this version of myself

49:43.188 --> 49:45.190
that you deserve to wear the uniform

49:45.273 --> 49:47.859
just as much, if not more,
than the others.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.415
-It shouldn't be much longer to the bank.
-I can't. I'm not gonna make it.

50:01.498 --> 50:04.543
-Can you hang on a little longer?
-Stop. I gotta lie down.

50:04.626 --> 50:07.129
-Okay, let me find somewhere.
-Right now!

50:17.264 --> 50:19.391
[Jennifer groaning]

50:19.474 --> 50:21.101
Don't worry. I got you.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.273
Come on. Let's get you inside.

50:36.450 --> 50:37.284
I found them.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.375
Hello? We need help!

50:45.459 --> 50:46.710
[Jennifer wails]

50:47.502 --> 50:49.629
-I need to lie down. Now!
-All right.

50:49.713 --> 50:52.632
All right, stay here.
I'll go find somebody.

50:58.805 --> 50:59.639
It's ringing.

50:59.723 --> 51:01.641
[operator] 911. What's your emergency?

51:01.725 --> 51:02.559
Jennifer?

51:02.642 --> 51:03.477
Hello?

51:04.144 --> 51:05.395
Do you have an emergency?

51:08.106 --> 51:09.107
Jennifer!

51:24.790 --> 51:25.749
Jennifer.

51:29.252 --> 51:30.462
I'm scared, Ben.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.883
[Jennifer breathing tremulously]

51:49.397 --> 51:51.399
[faint, resonant ringing]

51:57.948 --> 52:00.325
[whistling cheerfully]

52:03.495 --> 52:05.705
-Someone can't take a hint.
-[cocks gun]

52:11.002 --> 52:12.879
[sinister music playing]

52:17.300 --> 52:20.053
[whistles emphatically]

52:20.929 --> 52:23.348
Jean! Jean!

52:29.396 --> 52:30.397
[sighs]

52:32.357 --> 52:33.483
No!

52:42.492 --> 52:44.578
This all could have been so simple.

52:56.548 --> 52:59.342
[sinister music playing]

53:01.303 --> 53:02.679
[flesh rending wetly]

53:11.938 --> 53:13.732
[unsettling rustling]

53:18.236 --> 53:19.237
[music trails off]

53:19.321 --> 53:20.655
[indistinct chatter]

53:20.739 --> 53:22.741
[quirky, deliberate music playing]

53:44.304 --> 53:45.764
You changed your shirt?

53:46.514 --> 53:48.934
The other one got stained.

53:49.476 --> 53:50.727
Chikkadoo sauce.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.315
Mint chocolate chip.

53:56.983 --> 54:00.487
What's gotten into you, Gene?
You know that gives you the runs.

54:02.280 --> 54:06.952
Nothing wrong with living on the edge
from time to time, my love.

54:07.869 --> 54:09.871
[uneasy music playing]

54:12.499 --> 54:13.625
Leaders.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.712
One of our teams found Ben and Jennifer.

54:19.005 --> 54:21.007
[tense, martial music playing]

54:21.591 --> 54:23.176
It's time to put out the call.

54:29.224 --> 54:30.058
Are you sure?

54:31.559 --> 54:32.727
Play the song.

54:42.237 --> 54:43.738
[music swells, trails off]

54:45.073 --> 54:47.075
[riveting rock violin music playing]
