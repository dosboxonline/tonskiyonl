This is Tow-6 to base. Hello?

01:44.354 --> 01:48.232
This is Tow-6 to base. Pick
up. Get your hand off the doughnut.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.025
Hello, Tow-6, this is base.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.193
Thank you.

01:51.361 --> 01:53.237
- How long to get back?
- Fifteen minutes.

01:53.404 --> 01:56.365
- See you soon.
- That's a 10-4.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.117
Hoffman told you?

01:58.284 --> 02:01.620
What are you doing listening to one word
coming out of that idiot's mouth?

02:01.788 --> 02:04.540
You've probably just cost this company
the whole account!

02:05.208 --> 02:06.917
Jesus, Mary and...

02:07.210 --> 02:08.210
Oh, shit!

02:13.508 --> 02:14.508
Hey.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.386
Look out!

02:22.725 --> 02:24.059
Oh, my God.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.455
Hang in there, buddy.
Help is on the way.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.878
Hang tight.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.590
Over here!

02:58.386 --> 03:00.679
You're gonna be okay.
Don't move.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.266
All right.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.603
Can you hear me?

03:09.230 --> 03:12.107
Easy, easy! Watch his left
arm. It could be broken.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.194
- Careful.
- Left hand is...

03:20.241 --> 03:23.076
Hey. Check this out.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.462
It was Velcroed under the dash.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.172
Thanks.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.257
He had a gun.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.281
Let's go back, then.

04:01.449 --> 04:02.824
I ought to slap her.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.451
Big ass.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.745
She was a bitch. I mean, a real bitch.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.997
Tell me about it.

04:23.554 --> 04:25.264
Fine, chump.

04:46.202 --> 04:48.495
Okay, kids, wake up. We're going inside.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.585
Kids, you ready?

04:55.753 --> 04:57.379
Yeah, we're ready.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.548
Okay, we're gonna knock on the door.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.968
Knock on the door, Biggs.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.887
Police!

05:06.264 --> 05:08.223
Police! Freeze!
Don't even think about it!

05:08.433 --> 05:10.600
- Get away from the gun!
- Hey!

05:10.768 --> 05:12.436
What are you doing in here?

05:14.397 --> 05:15.689
Hands behind your back.

05:15.857 --> 05:17.357
Let go of her, you moron!

05:17.817 --> 05:19.067
You're gonna have to kill me!

05:29.746 --> 05:31.288
Hands in the air! Against the wall!

05:31.456 --> 05:32.622
- Okay, okay!
- Do it!

05:36.085 --> 05:37.502
Blocked it. Look at this.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.422
Yeah, right back to work.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.758
Got him up high, then tossed him down.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.593
Hit him! Hit him!

05:47.305 --> 05:48.638
Get over there!

05:48.806 --> 05:50.057
- Not my baby!
- Hey!

05:51.768 --> 05:54.436
- Come here. Get over here.
- Just trying to get...

05:54.604 --> 05:56.480
- Freeze! Where are you going?
- My baby's crying.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.231
- My baby's crying.
- Stay where you are.

05:58.399 --> 06:00.609
- Freeze. Stay where you are!
- I'm checking on my baby.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.153
- Just let me check on my baby.
- Get away.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.113
- Get away.
- Have a heart, man.

06:05.281 --> 06:06.615
Get away!

06:21.547 --> 06:24.966
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.766
Excellent work, young man.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.436
What a fight!

06:40.191 --> 06:43.360
Okay, Michael.
Regular or extra-crispy?

06:49.033 --> 06:50.867
Goddamn this.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.955
Damn, Michael!

06:55.373 --> 06:57.833
- I could've done that.
- I'll need a tetanus shot.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.627
Cosmo, help me out of this chicken suit,
will you?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.965
That's $120 more.

07:05.133 --> 07:09.803
I don't understand. With the taxes
Americans pay, health care should be free.

07:09.971 --> 07:13.181
You got my vote, honey.
But you're still $18 short.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.191
Marie. Marie!

07:25.820 --> 07:27.154
Mark.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.906
Oh, Mark. What happened?

07:30.074 --> 07:32.409
Don't worry, baby.
It's not as bad as it looks.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.036
See? Legs still work.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.372
Yeah, but your neck, your arm.

07:37.540 --> 07:41.585
I got a plate there from an old injury,
so they put that on as a precaution.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.378
- Okay.
- I don't know what happened.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.380
I'm driving the truck to base.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.049
The next thing I know,
I was upside down in the cab.

07:48.217 --> 07:51.303
Oh. Then you were very lucky.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.556
You have no idea.

07:54.724 --> 07:55.974
Mr. Warren?

07:56.142 --> 07:58.226
Officer Porter,
thanks for your help.

07:58.394 --> 08:00.061
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.273
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.067
Come on. We'll straighten it out
down at the station.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.277
Step aside, ma'am.

08:08.696 --> 08:12.282
- Hey, Cosmo. This one's on me.
- About time, you cheap bastard.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.367
- Only one.
- Then I'll make it a double.

08:14.535 --> 08:18.038
As long as I live, if I never see Gerard
in yellow tights again...

08:18.206 --> 08:19.748
I'll die a happy man.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.959
- Hey fellas, look. Look, you're on TV.
- Hey.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.712
Hey, hey, hey. Look at us! We're on TV!

08:27.089 --> 08:28.798
We're on TV. Make it louder!

08:28.966 --> 08:31.176
The Conroy brothers were brought...

08:31.344 --> 08:33.385
to the courthouse
for an extradition hearing.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.847
When he grabbed you by the throat,
I thought I'd take a dump.

08:37.015 --> 08:40.393
- I did. I had to go change my underwear.
- Oh, man.

08:41.062 --> 08:44.272
Hey, look at my head! Twenty-seven
stitches! All because of this scumbag!

08:44.440 --> 08:46.566
Twenty-seven stitches, my ass!

08:46.734 --> 08:48.568
During the raid,
both brothers were wounded.

08:48.736 --> 08:50.570
The Conroys made allegations...

08:50.738 --> 08:52.364
- ...of excessive force...
- Sam.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.992
Particularly against senior
Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.911
I don't look like that. That guy's ugly.

08:58.079 --> 09:02.249
Hey, Sammy, nice suit. She'll have
a martini and we'll take a check.

09:02.416 --> 09:03.750
- Who died?
- Shut up.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.294
Three Tennessee
state corrections officers dead.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.089
Reporting from the federal courthouse,
Stacia Vela.

09:09.298 --> 09:12.133
Reporting for Channel 2 News, Chicago.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.636
Ladies and gentlemen,
the United States Marshals!

09:15.972 --> 09:19.975
Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands
together for the U.S. Marshal Service.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.895
Speech! Speech!

09:27.984 --> 09:33.196
Noah Newman, Cosmo Renfro,
Savannah Cooper, Bobby Biggs!

09:33.573 --> 09:36.199
You guys are, without doubt,
the sorriest excuse...

09:36.367 --> 09:38.159
for a warrant squad
I ever worked with.

09:39.495 --> 09:40.745
But nobody got hurt.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.622
It's probably important.

09:42.790 --> 09:45.125
- And you stayed close on the lead dog.
- Woof!

09:45.293 --> 09:47.877
- Which means you get to keep working.
- Get paid too?

09:48.045 --> 09:51.006
A round for this group here,
and a double milk for this kid.

09:56.637 --> 10:00.890
Mr. Warren. We seem
to have a small discrepancy.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.186
Let me help you with that.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.022
That's not me.

10:08.107 --> 10:12.027
You caught that. You're aware it's
illegal to carry a handgun in Chicago?

10:13.821 --> 10:14.904
Come on.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.783
You ever try towing a car on the
Dan Ryan at 3 a.m. without a handgun?

10:18.951 --> 10:21.703
What about East 42nd,
1 st Avenue in New York City?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.872
- What about it?
- Ever been there?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.665
- No.
- Never?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.709
- Never.
- Oh.

10:27.877 --> 10:31.588
Then you wouldn't know about the double
homicide took place there last December?

10:32.089 --> 10:33.173
Obviously not.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.384
That's interesting.
Because the prints we took off you...

10:37.428 --> 10:39.012
flagged this.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.265
Federal arrest warrant for Mark Roberts.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.392
Prints from the crime scene
match yours.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.645
This is bullshit. This is bullshit.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.438
Let me talk to a lawyer.
Don't touch me.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.106
You'll get a lawyer...

10:50.274 --> 10:52.651
at your extradition hearing!

10:52.818 --> 10:54.569
You're going back to New York.

10:54.737 --> 10:59.074
Back? I've never been to New York! I don't
know nothing about a double homicide.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.659
Get him out of here.

11:00.826 --> 11:03.578
You'll have plenty of time
to explain that in New York.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.372
You got the wrong man.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.957
- Get him out of here.
- You're making a mistake.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.668
Thanks.

11:11.629 --> 11:15.674
- There, Mark Warren. What's going on?
- I don't know.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.842
Why is it taking so long?

11:18.052 --> 11:19.761
It's still being processed.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.554
Mark! Mark!

11:21.722 --> 11:24.808
- Hold it there.
- Mark! Mark!

11:25.059 --> 11:26.434
Marie, it's okay. It's okay.

11:26.644 --> 11:29.312
- What's happening?
- Just a little mistaken identity.

11:29.772 --> 11:30.980
Where are they taking you?

11:31.315 --> 11:35.276
Just be cool, baby.
Everything's gonna be fine.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.121
- You know...
- Yeah, well.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.960
- Have a lovely evening.
- Thank you.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.295
I'll be right back.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.089
Oh, hi.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.299
Hello, deputy. I'm surprised you made it.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.635
Catherine.

12:00.803 --> 12:02.262
This is Stacia Vela.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.557
This is U.S. Marshal Catherine Walsh.
She's the boss.

12:05.725 --> 12:10.645
Delighted to meet you. I've seen you so
much on TV. You're very lovely in person.

12:10.813 --> 12:11.980
Thank you.

12:12.148 --> 12:16.025
You're welcome. I'm gonna take Sam
away from you for just a minute.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.279
- Sure. I'll go and wait at the bar.
- Okay.

12:21.490 --> 12:25.493
Never one to be afraid of the obvious.
I admire that in a man.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.704
- Did I do something?
- Yeah.

12:27.872 --> 12:31.833
You hit your prisoner while he was
in handcuffs. He could sue us.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.170
He bit one of my kids,
he got smacked on the head. So what?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.505
- "So what?"
- Yeah, so what?

12:37.673 --> 12:39.924
Twenty-seven stitches is "So what?"

12:40.092 --> 12:43.219
He needed a smack on the head,
he got it. What's the big deal?

12:43.387 --> 12:46.931
Look, D.C. wants to take
full advantage of this Conroy bust.

12:47.141 --> 12:51.102
You are gonna personally escort
these clowns to the federal pen.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.063
- You will give a little speech to the press.
- No, I don't...

12:54.231 --> 12:56.232
You are going...

12:56.400 --> 13:00.195
to do a nice little PR
song and dance. And then...

13:00.404 --> 13:02.197
you are gonna go fishing...

13:02.364 --> 13:03.948
- What?
- ...or something.

13:04.116 --> 13:07.827
You're gonna take a vacation.
You're gonna be happy.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.246
Okay?

13:12.124 --> 13:13.625
Okay.

13:14.251 --> 13:17.337
The plane leaves at midnight.
You be on it.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.430
- Go.
- Keep moving.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.934
Right over there. Go.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.940
- Name and number.
- Over there.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.442
- Let's go.
- Name and number.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.581
- Welcome to the unfriendly skies, Sam.
- Yeah.

13:59.171 --> 14:00.296
Come along.

14:00.464 --> 14:02.924
- Seventy-two.
- Check.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.179
- Eighty-four.
- Check.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.390
Right here.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.767
Thirty-six.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.395
Check.

14:27.658 --> 14:29.784
Set your bag over here.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.125
- Look at the bright side.
- Hm?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.376
We're always on time.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.887
Close up.

14:53.183 --> 14:54.809
- Lock it up.
- Right.

15:00.649 --> 15:01.649
All locked.

15:01.817 --> 15:03.943
- All locked.
- All locked.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.822
Clearance, F-PATS 343, Memphis.

15:08.240 --> 15:12.327
Okay. It's on to Memphis and then
La Guardia, and we call it a night.

15:24.548 --> 15:26.424
Turn out the light. It's late.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.676
Be a couple minutes.

16:06.882 --> 16:07.924
Hey.

16:08.425 --> 16:10.718
Hey. Gotta use the can.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.388
Look, you can hold it.
We got 20 minutes till we land.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.056
I've been holding it.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.558
I have to go right now.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.894
I'm serious.
I'm about to explode right here.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.399
Can he go?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.234
Yeah, let him go.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.031
7-C.

16:45.879 --> 16:47.296
All right, let's go.

18:26.980 --> 18:30.149
"Split on ice." Seven letters.

18:30.317 --> 18:31.359
Banana.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.444
- No, bananas.
- What?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.739
Bananas. Plural.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.369
Oh, yeah. Bananas.

19:19.449 --> 19:20.575
What the hell was that?

19:20.742 --> 19:23.494
We're losing cabin pressure!
Oxygen mask on.

19:25.914 --> 19:28.708
We're sinking. We're sinking, 2,000.

19:41.930 --> 19:43.681
Engine failure on 2 and 3.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.184
Indy Center, this is F-PATS, Flight 343.

19:47.102 --> 19:50.062
We are declaring an emergency.
Mayday, mayday!

19:54.234 --> 19:55.943
We're at two-four-zero.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.737
Three-two-zero.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.656
One-seven thousand.

20:03.285 --> 20:04.911
One-three thousand.

20:05.162 --> 20:06.495
I've got it. I've got it.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.915
One-one thousand.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.050
We're at 10,000.

20:20.302 --> 20:21.344
What the hell was that?

20:22.095 --> 20:25.640
We lost Engines 2 and 3.
A and B hydraulic failures as well.

20:25.807 --> 20:29.018
Look at your charts. See if there's
any airport we can make.

20:29.853 --> 20:32.480
- There's nothing close.
- There's a road 20 miles ahead.

20:33.148 --> 20:34.273
Okay. That's it then.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.817
Indy Center, this is F-PATS 343.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.160
And still losing altitude.
We have lost two engines...

20:46.328 --> 20:49.038
and we need to make
an immediate emergency landing.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.123
Make the announcement.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.334
Passengers, brace for
an emergency landing.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.379
Place your head between your knees
and brace for impact.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.590
Keep your heads down. Brace for impact.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.183
Three-two. Three thousand.

21:11.603 --> 21:14.063
Two thousand above ground.
Sinking 1,500.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.065
I got the road.

21:17.109 --> 21:18.442
Okay, gear down.

21:31.373 --> 21:32.873
One thousand.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.294
Five hundred above ground.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.464
One hundred above ground.
Brace for impact.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.663
Oh, no.

22:13.749 --> 22:15.082
Shit!

22:15.917 --> 22:17.251
Jesus Christ!

22:17.836 --> 22:19.295
Holy shit!

23:00.003 --> 23:01.128
Oh, God.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.963
We're running out of road, guys!

23:04.883 --> 23:05.925
Aw, shit.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.556
Get down.
This man is unconscious.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.183
This man right here.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.415
Bring out the weapons.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.460
All right, dude, you're swimming.

24:25.046 --> 24:26.630
Stay right there. Back.

24:26.798 --> 24:28.632
What are you guys doing?

24:28.800 --> 24:30.050
Clear!

24:30.385 --> 24:31.719
Rick!

24:34.222 --> 24:36.098
Mine didn't open!

24:47.986 --> 24:49.945
Keys, keys! Give me those keys!

24:51.531 --> 24:53.866
Hey, hey. Slow down! One at a time!

24:57.162 --> 25:00.498
All right. Keep it moving!
Keep it moving! One at a time.

25:00.665 --> 25:02.666
I ain't going in that water!

25:10.926 --> 25:12.760
- You going somewhere?
- No.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.637
Good. Hold that light on these shackles.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.972
I'll get this guy out of here.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.600
Play any tricks, our guys'll shoot you.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.278
Hurry up! I can't swim!

25:31.488 --> 25:32.613
Get out!

25:38.537 --> 25:40.079
Get out of there.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.839
Go! Go!

25:51.299 --> 25:53.342
Gerard! We're going under! Leave them!

25:53.802 --> 25:56.762
Leave the rest of them! Leave them!

25:56.930 --> 25:58.097
Come on! We gotta move out!

26:43.685 --> 26:46.478
Get your head up there, jackoff.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.566
Take a deep breath.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.880
Calm down! You wanna live?

28:39.843 --> 28:43.429
- All the way down here and along that ridge.
- Got you.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.474
Hey, they found the two
that fell from the plane.

28:48.393 --> 28:52.396
That Chinese fellow dropped in some
poor old boy's roof and into the bathtub.

28:52.605 --> 28:56.150
- Looked like a big bowl of gumbo...
- I get the picture, sheriff.

28:56.317 --> 28:59.611
Deputy Gerard, we still got
one prisoner unaccounted for.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.030
Mark Roberts. He was seated in 10-D.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.825
I guess the river got him.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.162
No. No, the river didn't get this guy.
He's loose.

29:08.329 --> 29:11.999
If you can't find him dead someplace,
he's running, folks.

29:13.918 --> 29:15.711
We got a fugitive.

29:16.296 --> 29:20.674
Seems we have ourselves a bona fide
federal fugitive out on the lam.

29:20.842 --> 29:23.802
Name of Roberts, Mark J.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.221
Somebody give me a map.

29:27.015 --> 29:29.057
- Who's got a map around here?
- I got one.

29:29.684 --> 29:32.644
Oh, all right. Thanks, Earl.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.980
Okay.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.110
Okay. Now...

29:40.904 --> 29:46.033
I want you setting up roadblocks,
general radius of...

29:46.409 --> 29:48.702
10, 12 miles.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.162
Twenty.

29:50.538 --> 29:54.082
- What?
- He's got a real big head start.

29:55.210 --> 29:57.044
Oh, okay, 20 then.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.087
That sounds good. And...

29:59.672 --> 30:03.467
- In all directions, just like a big...
- Perimeter.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.553
Circle deal.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.473
Which should start
somewhere near...

30:13.228 --> 30:14.228
What do you think?

30:17.106 --> 30:20.567
Said perimeter to extend downstream...

30:20.735 --> 30:23.737
from Brookport to Mound City.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.949
Every bridge across the Ohio River
from Golconda...

30:27.200 --> 30:28.992
to Metropolis to Cairo...

30:29.202 --> 30:31.245
needs to be closed down.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.080
Extending south from Alexander...

30:33.248 --> 30:36.250
and Pulaski county lines,
have every house, hotel...

30:36.417 --> 30:39.837
hospital, back road and backwater
searched for Mr. Mark J. Roberts.

30:41.214 --> 30:43.590
Get his picture on the local television
and keep it there.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.802
Please consider him dangerous,
and please...

30:47.220 --> 30:49.096
act accordingly.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.894
Found a shoe. Looks like prison issue.

30:56.062 --> 30:58.480
Okay. Continue to search.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.317
Looks like we found the place
he came ashore.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.463
Jesus!

31:23.631 --> 31:26.300
Looks like the skies
weren't too friendly last night.

31:26.467 --> 31:29.303
- Sam used up eight of his nine lives on this.
- He's over there.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.972
Where?
It looks like he's in one piece.

31:32.140 --> 31:34.349
Sammy, how you doing?

31:34.517 --> 31:36.852
Hey, you think they got
a fat-free menu in this joint?

31:37.186 --> 31:39.771
- What are you talking about?
- Is anybody else hungry?

31:39.939 --> 31:41.690
- I don't believe you two.
- Smells good.

31:41.858 --> 31:43.984
How can you talk about food
at a time like this?

31:44.152 --> 31:47.654
I wonder if they have
that vinegar barbeque.

31:47.822 --> 31:50.991
- Yeah. On the French fries.
- On the meat, the French fries.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.702
- It's big in England.
- It's big everywhere.

31:53.870 --> 31:55.996
- You all right?
- No, who's got my clothes?

31:56.164 --> 31:57.414
I do.

31:59.167 --> 32:00.709
Nice?

32:02.462 --> 32:03.503
- I knew it.
- What?

32:03.671 --> 32:07.174
- Told you he wouldn't like it.
- I got the same thing last Christmas.

32:07.342 --> 32:09.343
Well, I don't know.
There's so many people in here.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.681
Anybody got $9 so I can buy a T-shirt?

32:14.849 --> 32:17.184
You owe me $85 for this.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.353
- I got one.
- Here, here, here.

32:19.520 --> 32:20.854
Come on. Come on, come on.

32:22.357 --> 32:26.526
All right. State police found a shoe
over here near Hillerman.

32:26.694 --> 32:27.861
What do you got?

32:28.571 --> 32:31.990
Oh, boss, nothing, nada.
It's like this guy doesn't even exist.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.576
- Is this food free?
- Eat up. It's on the county.

32:34.744 --> 32:37.371
He called himself Mark warren in Chicago.
Ids were forged.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.707
Mark Roberts ain't nothing but a photo
and a set of prints on a warrant.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.751
- This is the guy?
- Cute.

32:42.919 --> 32:44.878
Noah, you bring my gun?

32:46.130 --> 32:48.840
All right. Cute?

33:09.362 --> 33:11.071
Where will I find Deputy Sam Gerard?

33:11.906 --> 33:13.407
Right here!

33:17.662 --> 33:21.707
Bertram Lamb. I'm director
of the Diplomatic Security Service...

33:21.874 --> 33:24.876
State Department.
Special Agent Frank Barrows.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.796
- What's up?
- Mark Roberts.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.090
- Okay.
- What do you know about this man?

33:30.466 --> 33:32.092
Double murder, robbery, escape.

33:36.639 --> 33:38.682
These men were not ordinary civilians.

33:39.976 --> 33:43.186
They were my agents,
murdered by Mark Roberts...

33:43.354 --> 33:45.689
in cold blood at the U.N.
last January.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.150
- That's not on his warrant.
- All information...

33:48.317 --> 33:51.111
on this was sanitized
for reasons of national security.

33:51.279 --> 33:54.114
- Why'd Mark Roberts kill your guys?
- We don't know.

33:54.282 --> 33:58.618
All we have are his fingerprints at the
scene. We've chased him for six months.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.121
- Oh. So we're working for you now?
- No, no.

34:02.331 --> 34:03.457
That's not my intention.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.834
Your reputation precedes you, deputy.

34:06.002 --> 34:08.503
We want you to continue
running the pursuit...

34:08.670 --> 34:10.380
but we want Roberts fast.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.466
- Okay, we're fast.
- Real fast.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.010
We'll need to be kept
in the loop on this every step.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.219
- Try to keep you up to speed.
- Taken care of.

34:17.429 --> 34:20.514
I brought one of my men
to join your team to do just that.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.185
Special Agent John Royce.

34:24.478 --> 34:29.315
No offense, but we actually work a lot
faster if we don't have any help.

34:29.484 --> 34:32.319
No offense taken.
You don't have a choice.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.362
I've cleared this with Marshal Walsh.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.572
Royce is one of our best men.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.533
You'll find him useful.

34:39.159 --> 34:40.409
Good luck, deputy.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.212
How you doing?

34:50.379 --> 34:53.422
- If it's any consolation, I wouldn't...
- It's not any consolation.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.467
- Take off your sunglasses.
- Why?

34:56.636 --> 34:58.303
So I can see your face.

34:59.597 --> 35:01.098
Hi.

35:01.265 --> 35:02.974
How'd you pull this duty?

35:03.142 --> 35:05.560
Your fugitive murdered two of my friends.
I volunteered.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.522
Ever make a fugitive arrest before?

35:08.689 --> 35:11.525
- No. Planning to shortly.
- You have a weapon?

35:12.193 --> 35:13.276
Yeah, a big one. You?

35:16.405 --> 35:18.448
You sure you wanna
get cute with me?

35:22.537 --> 35:24.538
- Have a backup weapon?
- Never had the need.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.749
Get one. Keep that in your suit
unless I tell you to take it out.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.752
Get a Glock.
Lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol.

35:30.920 --> 35:35.382
Let's move. I'm not having fun. You
know I get cranky when I don't have fun.

35:35.550 --> 35:36.925
We know, we know.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.219
Get the state police director
on the phone.

35:39.637 --> 35:43.306
Cooper, I want you to get the background
on the Chinese guy on the airplane.

35:43.474 --> 35:47.853
And, Cosmo, get the local sheriff lined out
and ready to go. He's feeling weak.

35:48.020 --> 35:49.646
Working on it.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.565
You come with me.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.067
I think he likes you.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.248
Martha?

36:09.542 --> 36:10.667
Just drive.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.180
- How soon can I get on that airplane?
- Soon as we get it on the barge.

36:23.389 --> 36:25.140
Sam!

36:26.350 --> 36:28.810
I got something on that shooter
in the plane.

36:28.978 --> 36:33.523
Name's Vincent Ling. He was on his way
back to the pen. Just lost an appeal.

36:33.691 --> 36:36.735
Serving a life sentence for murder
for a Chinese mob hit.

36:36.903 --> 36:41.364
Look at this. Sheriff in Metropolis just found
this in a Dumpster behind a Laundromat.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.453
All right. Our boy
got a new set of clothes.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.414
- Biggsy, where's Metropolis?
- I don't know. Ask Superman.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.291
- Shut up, Biggs.
- Right over here.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.628
Get on the radio, move that perimeter
20 miles south of the river.

36:54.795 --> 36:57.631
- He might've made it into Kentucky already.
- Right.

36:57.798 --> 37:00.467
Statistically, he's more likely headed
for a major city.

37:00.635 --> 37:02.469
St. Louis. North.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.221
This cat ain't no statistic.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.140
Not yet.

37:43.594 --> 37:47.013
Holy shit! Sammy,
you're a lucky man. How many dead?

37:47.181 --> 37:48.515
Eight.

38:08.577 --> 38:10.704
Coop, you got your little black box?

38:16.919 --> 38:18.545
Save that light.

38:21.215 --> 38:22.757
What's that?

38:28.889 --> 38:30.724
What's that?

38:31.976 --> 38:34.728
- That is not a ballpoint pen.
- Oh.

38:34.895 --> 38:39.065
Zip guns aren't standard issue on
federal corrections prisoner transports.

38:39.233 --> 38:40.275
- No.
- No.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.068
No, that's in those spy movies.

38:42.403 --> 38:44.112
I saw one on TV one time.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.073
- That James Bond movie.
- Shagadelic, baby.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.366
Shaft.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.452
Send it to a lab.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.329
Stinger. Mm-hm.

38:52.496 --> 38:55.373
XL-17, Korean, .22 caliber.

38:55.541 --> 38:59.044
He found it with his
little flashlight. Hey.

38:59.545 --> 39:03.048
What the hell are you doing?

39:04.050 --> 39:05.383
What...?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.428
That was my phone.
It was my personal phone.

39:08.596 --> 39:12.223
You're under arrest for obstructing a federal
investigation. You have the right...

39:12.391 --> 39:14.476
- It's not convictable.
- Oh, it's arrestable.

39:14.643 --> 39:16.811
Are you crazy? Is this guy crazy?

39:17.271 --> 39:18.563
No, but he's a carrier.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.315
My superiors won't like this.

39:20.524 --> 39:23.026
I am your superior.
Sit down there and shut up.

39:23.235 --> 39:25.945
When you keep information from us,
it pisses him off.

39:27.573 --> 39:30.158
Deputy, get me out of these cuffs
right now.

39:31.619 --> 39:32.911
Get out of them yourself.

39:40.878 --> 39:43.213
What are you doing?

39:43.381 --> 39:45.173
What's he doing?

39:57.228 --> 39:58.561
What's next, cow tipping?

39:59.980 --> 40:01.356
- That's pretty good.
- Very slick.

40:01.524 --> 40:04.651
Very slick? The guy just
broke my fucking glasses.

40:05.194 --> 40:06.486
I've never seen that before.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.280
I have.

40:24.088 --> 40:27.674
Don't have a heart attack, Earl.
You've lied to the cops before.

40:51.532 --> 40:53.408
What...? What's the trouble, officer?

40:53.576 --> 40:56.202
Fugitive's on the loose
from the plane crash last night.

40:56.620 --> 40:58.371
Oh, is that a fact? Shit.

40:58.539 --> 40:59.873
You seen this man?

41:00.040 --> 41:02.709
No, I've never seen
anybody like that.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.878
What about you, ma'am?
You seen this man?

41:05.045 --> 41:07.046
No, me neither.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.556
- Thanks for your help, folks.
- Sure.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.275
Drive! Drive! Drive!

41:30.488 --> 41:31.905
Drive!

41:35.451 --> 41:36.451
Hey.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.203
Push!

41:44.210 --> 41:45.418
Oh, my!

41:52.551 --> 41:54.677
Chester, you okay?!

42:00.976 --> 42:02.435
You done good, Earl.

42:05.606 --> 42:07.649
Sam! Sam!

42:07.816 --> 42:10.276
An 18-wheeler rammed a roadblock
15 minutes ago.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.154
They found it outside of Paducah.
It was heading south.

42:13.781 --> 42:14.822
All right, load up!

42:14.990 --> 42:16.407
Like I said, south.

42:16.575 --> 42:19.994
We're gonna need boats.
This guy went into the swamp.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.372
Shit, I hate swamps.

42:22.540 --> 42:26.751
Hey, Lester. It's U.S. Marshal Renfro.
We're gonna need boats.

42:26.919 --> 42:30.588
Yeah, swamp boats. Right,
like they use in the swamp.

42:47.648 --> 42:49.649
Pulled that up,
he got that away from me.

42:49.817 --> 42:53.319
I had six rounds in the chamber
and I had another box underneath the seat.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.322
Bad news. He got a .38 off the trucker.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.950
- How many rounds?
- Six in the gun, 12 more in a box.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.368
Makes no difference.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.704
He'll be dead from snakebite by dark.

43:04.665 --> 43:08.001
He won't get far in that boat he stole.
It ain't got no motor.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.712
Boats. I hate boats, bugs and boats.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.631
Sam, he got a boat from here.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.345
All right, could I have your attention?

43:19.513 --> 43:21.764
We'll divide up and search this swamp.

43:21.932 --> 43:25.852
One officer with each of you.
Who knows most about this terrain?

43:26.020 --> 43:27.437
- That's me.
- Right here.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.607
Which one of you is the ugliest, most
inbred, country son of a bitch here?

43:34.028 --> 43:35.278
You come with me.

44:13.984 --> 44:15.151
How long will you be?

44:15.361 --> 44:18.196
Okay, everybody,
com-check with me now on 3.

44:18.364 --> 44:19.405
- Sam.
- Com-check 3.

44:19.573 --> 44:20.698
- Biggs.
- Com-check.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.909
- Newman. Cosmo.
- Com-check.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.161
You get a visual, put up a flare...

44:25.329 --> 44:27.455
call for backup, stay in the boat!

44:28.332 --> 44:31.000
How long will you be out?
I got PTA tonight.

44:31.168 --> 44:34.128
We'll be out till we catch him.
PTA's on hold.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.631
- You be careful.
- Always.

46:07.181 --> 46:08.347
I got a visual. It's him.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.683
Put up your flare. Put up your flare.

46:12.519 --> 46:13.853
He's moving. I'm going in.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.397
Stay in the boat. Stay in the boat.
Wait for us.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.582
- There's a flare.
- Right in through there.

46:47.971 --> 46:50.807
Pull up to that bank.
Get around to the other side.

46:50.974 --> 46:53.851
Be careful. This man's mad
and he's got a gun.

46:55.395 --> 46:56.437
It's him.

46:56.605 --> 46:57.647
Go! Faster!

47:51.869 --> 47:54.579
I'll take the gun. Walk.

47:55.664 --> 47:57.623
Come on, move! Move, move!

47:57.791 --> 47:58.958
Yeah. What happens now?

47:59.126 --> 48:00.960
We dance. Walk.

48:01.545 --> 48:03.296
Drop the gun, pal.

48:04.298 --> 48:07.258
It's been a long day for everybody.
Let's end it on a positive note.

48:08.385 --> 48:10.136
For me or for you?

48:10.429 --> 48:12.763
Everybody walks away breathing,
everybody wins.

48:13.098 --> 48:15.308
How long will I live
if I let you take me in?

48:17.019 --> 48:18.477
You forget about the plane?

48:18.687 --> 48:19.979
Look around, you're caught.

48:25.235 --> 48:26.527
It's over.

48:27.821 --> 48:29.155
Let's go home.

48:36.496 --> 48:38.164
No. You go home.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.169
Oh, Lord!

48:43.337 --> 48:45.546
- Hurry it up.
- Come on, move!

49:02.272 --> 49:03.522
Gerard's been hit.

49:08.487 --> 49:09.862
Come on!

49:10.697 --> 49:11.822
He's over there.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.835
- How is he?
- He'll be fine.

50:20.851 --> 50:22.435
How is it to nearly get killed?

50:24.021 --> 50:27.982
If he was trying to kill me, he'd have
shot me in the head, not the vest.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.694
Ever occur to you maybe he just missed?

50:31.862 --> 50:35.698
I don't think we're dealing with a guy
who misses. Yeah.

50:37.701 --> 50:41.370
Maybe it's time to let someone else
catch this one, Sam.

50:42.247 --> 50:44.790
- You don't think I'm incapable...
- You're capable, sure.

50:45.042 --> 50:47.168
Okay, then let me do my job.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.382
Don't make me wrong, Sam.

50:54.217 --> 50:57.803
- You screw up and I swear to God...
- I know.

51:01.224 --> 51:04.560
- I love you, Sam.
- I know.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.481
But don't think I won't fire your ass.

51:24.247 --> 51:28.709
Biggs, you and Cooper are staying here.
We're going back to Chicago.

51:28.877 --> 51:32.338
We'll find out who put that gun
on the plane and who Mark Roberts is.

51:32.506 --> 51:35.508
Take us to the airport. Who's got
my gun and credentials?

51:36.176 --> 51:39.720
- Hi, can I get you something to drink?
- Diet soda, please.

51:43.558 --> 51:46.602
Look, I made a mistake, okay?
I usually work alone.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.813
No, we're lucky I got shot, kid.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.189
- Lucky?
- Yeah.

51:50.357 --> 51:53.192
If he'd shot one of my deputies,
you wouldn't see your mama again...

51:53.360 --> 51:56.028
I'd be in jail for shooting you.

51:57.531 --> 51:58.781
We're lucky.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.950
I thought we don't
take our work personally.

52:01.118 --> 52:02.660
We don't.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.412
I do.

52:09.292 --> 52:11.794
Decaf grande cappuccino and a biscotti.

52:11.962 --> 52:13.504
- One Sidamo?
- Plus tax.

52:14.840 --> 52:15.840
Just a sec.

52:16.424 --> 52:18.050
Starbucks.

52:19.553 --> 52:22.596
Yeah. Marie, some guy has a question
about a grinder you sold him.

52:23.056 --> 52:25.141
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

52:26.184 --> 52:27.643
- Hello.
- Marie?

52:27.811 --> 52:30.146
- Mark?
- Can you talk?

52:30.564 --> 52:32.398
Wait a minute.

52:33.942 --> 52:36.569
Were you hurt? I saw the crash on TV.

52:36.736 --> 52:41.157
- No, no, no. Baby, I'm fine. I'm fine.
- They keep saying you're a criminal.

52:41.324 --> 52:42.658
You murdered two people.

52:42.826 --> 52:45.327
No, no, it's a lie. Marie, listen to me.

52:50.083 --> 52:52.751
- Where are you?
- I can't tell you that right now.

52:52.919 --> 52:55.921
I know there's some things
I didn't tell you about myself.

52:56.089 --> 52:59.675
Believe me when I tell you,
I did not do what they said I did.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.260
You do believe me?

53:01.428 --> 53:03.596
I want to believe you, Mark.

53:03.763 --> 53:05.764
I'm just confused and scared.

53:05.932 --> 53:07.850
Now, Marie, listen to me.

53:08.018 --> 53:10.186
Before we met,
I worked for the government.

53:10.353 --> 53:13.689
I was on a routine assignment
when it was ambushed.

53:14.107 --> 53:18.110
I killed two men in self-defense.

53:18.278 --> 53:20.779
Marie, I did not murder anyone.

53:20.947 --> 53:23.324
You have to believe me.
I wouldn't lie to you.

53:23.491 --> 53:24.742
What are you going to do?

53:24.910 --> 53:28.454
I'll find the person who set me up
and clear my name.

53:28.622 --> 53:32.458
It's something I thought
I could hide from, but I guess I can't.

53:33.793 --> 53:34.960
Will I ever see you again?

53:35.128 --> 53:38.130
Oh, come on now. Don't be crazy.

53:38.298 --> 53:39.798
Of course you will.

53:42.093 --> 53:43.719
Marie.

53:44.304 --> 53:48.307
I hate involving you in this, but,
baby, I got nobody else I can trust.

53:49.059 --> 53:52.269
- I can trust you, right?
- Of course you can, Mark.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.271
I love you.

53:54.481 --> 53:56.065
I need your help.

54:05.825 --> 54:07.201
Henry?

54:08.161 --> 54:09.828
- Got the casebooks on Roberts?
- Yeah.

54:09.996 --> 54:14.041
There was a woman at the hospital
when he was arrested. Paid his bill.

54:14.209 --> 54:16.460
- In cash.
- Find her.

54:19.464 --> 54:21.590
- U.N. garage has security cameras.
- Of course.

54:21.758 --> 54:23.884
Get the date and time
of the murders, find the tapes.

54:24.052 --> 54:25.094
We'll never get clearance.

54:26.429 --> 54:29.682
Get the clearance, get the tapes.
Don't tell me what we can't do.

54:31.184 --> 54:32.268
I'll get it done.

54:32.602 --> 54:34.353
- What?
- Roberts' apartment was clean.

54:34.521 --> 54:37.398
Been there six months,
neighbors barely remember him.

54:37.565 --> 54:39.108
Where'd he work?

54:39.526 --> 54:41.527
- I'm going there next.
- How about right now?

54:43.196 --> 54:44.989
- Sam.
- What do you got on the zip gun?

54:45.156 --> 54:49.535
We covered all the workers
who could've planted the gun...

54:49.703 --> 54:51.954
except for one guy, Kevin Peters.

54:52.122 --> 54:55.374
- Out on sick leave.
- Find him. Check them all out again.

54:55.542 --> 54:58.836
I wanna go through their families,
their associates...

54:59.045 --> 55:00.546
changes in personal habits...

55:00.714 --> 55:02.298
bank records, medical,
the works.

55:02.465 --> 55:05.551
- Stand on them till one squeaks.
- I'm on it.

55:29.909 --> 55:33.120
To see you walk in
was like a mainline of ego boost.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.581
I must've done something right...

55:35.749 --> 55:38.167
to see you come all the way here
in one piece.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.210
Yeah. It was all you, sarge.

55:40.378 --> 55:44.089
You're a hot commodity. Little birds
talking about big dollars to bring you in.

55:44.674 --> 55:45.716
Dead or alive?

55:46.009 --> 55:48.093
Emphasis on dead.

55:48.261 --> 55:49.720
On the plane, they tried.

55:50.263 --> 55:52.389
Almost succeeded too.

55:54.934 --> 55:56.268
You tempted?

55:56.436 --> 55:58.479
If you're the traitor they say you are.

55:58.646 --> 56:01.190
Oh, that's bullshit.

56:01.649 --> 56:04.276
- I got set up from the word "go."
- By who?

56:04.444 --> 56:06.737
That's what I gotta figure out.

56:06.946 --> 56:09.323
It's somebody on the inside.

56:09.949 --> 56:13.285
Got instructions by the usual channels.
Supposed to make a drop-off.

56:13.453 --> 56:14.953
Then all hell breaks loose.

56:16.289 --> 56:18.957
Damn, I thought I could disappear.

56:20.126 --> 56:21.668
Boy, was I wrong.

56:21.920 --> 56:22.961
Your next move?

56:25.548 --> 56:29.426
Find the Chinese bagman from the
U.N. garage and hope he leads me...

56:29.594 --> 56:33.514
to the person who set me up.
Then get righteous again.

56:33.973 --> 56:37.309
- How do you intend to do that?
- I got a couple ideas. Got the stuff?

56:45.151 --> 56:46.652
It's clean.

56:53.493 --> 56:55.244
Where's the key?

57:06.673 --> 57:10.342
Make sure you take it all.
I don't want you back here again.

57:10.510 --> 57:11.677
You don't believe me?

57:11.845 --> 57:14.179
I've gone as far as I'm prepared to go.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.849
I'll catch the rest on CNN.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.395
Good luck to you, man.

57:38.204 --> 57:40.205
You're a lucky guy.

57:40.790 --> 57:42.833
The old lady just kicked...

57:43.001 --> 57:45.085
day before yesterday.

57:49.299 --> 57:52.426
I can move out anything you don't want.

58:01.895 --> 58:03.729
It's perfect.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.128
- What do you got?
- We're in Pennsylvania.

58:28.296 --> 58:30.130
We got this guy
who says our fugitive...

58:30.298 --> 58:32.257
jumped him near Eddyville, Kentucky.

58:32.425 --> 58:34.760
Tied him up and stuffed him
in his own camper.

58:35.094 --> 58:37.387
- How long's he been there?
- Hold on, let me find out.

58:37.555 --> 58:39.389
- How long was he in there?
- Six hours.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.266
Six hours.

58:41.434 --> 58:45.187
What do you want? We're exhausted.
We haven't slept for two days.

58:45.355 --> 58:47.773
Stay on the trail.
You can sleep next month.

58:49.025 --> 58:51.527
Biggs and Cooper found a guy
tied up in his truck.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.820
He Id'd our man.

58:55.114 --> 58:58.825
Harrisburg. Seems he is heading north.
Maybe now you'll start listening to me.

58:59.285 --> 59:03.497
Explain why your ruthless assassin keeps
going out of his way to let people live.

59:05.583 --> 59:07.084
Hello.

59:07.335 --> 59:09.586
- Yeah, we're right on it.
- What's up?

59:09.754 --> 59:11.463
Found his lady.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.633
Newman? Newman!

59:14.801 --> 59:16.593
Where the hell is...?

59:24.686 --> 59:26.478
- Yes?
- Marie Bineaux?

59:26.646 --> 59:28.397
- Yes?
- U.S. Marshals.

59:29.607 --> 59:30.732
What's this about?

59:30.984 --> 59:33.193
Just a few questions.
May we come in?

59:36.489 --> 59:37.489
Just a second.

59:41.869 --> 59:42.995
Thank you.

59:50.169 --> 59:51.670
What do you want?

59:51.838 --> 59:53.964
You recognize this man?

59:55.508 --> 59:57.009
Never seen him before.

59:58.845 --> 59:59.886
- Excuse me.
- Really?

01:00:00.179 --> 01:00:01.722
No.

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:04.099
You sure about that?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:06.518
Yes. Sorry.

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:10.689
Maybe this'll help. It's a receipt from
Chicago Memorial for a Mark Warren.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:13.942
Paid in full. Is that your signature
on the bottom?

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:16.862
We can verify your signature.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:19.364
Are you here legally?

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.533
Familiar with
harboring and abetting laws?

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:24.202
That's five to 10 years.

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:26.038
Then they kick you out.

01:00:26.205 --> 01:00:29.750
Why are you threatening me like this?
Even if I knew this man...

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.877
that's no crime.
I've done nothing wrong.

01:00:32.045 --> 01:00:33.754
Mark Roberts has.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:36.465
DSS Special Agent...

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.216
Sam Harmon.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:41.386
Your friend killed him
with his bare hands.

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:43.472
Sam was a friend of mine.

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:45.974
So was Neil Kasinski.

01:00:46.601 --> 01:00:49.311
- Neil had three little kids.
- Stop doing this to me!

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:50.771
I don't know anything.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:55.233
I haven't heard from him and I won't.
I haven't seen him.

01:00:55.943 --> 01:00:57.402
So you do know him.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:01:00.572
- You just lied to us.
- That's a federal offense.

01:01:03.951 --> 01:01:07.746
All right, put those things away.
That's enough. I'm sorry if we upset you.

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:10.415
If you have the need,
you can call me...

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.125
at this number.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:14.544
Okay?

01:01:14.754 --> 01:01:16.046
Did you do that painting?

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:18.173
Yes. It's beautiful.

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:20.926
You have talent.
I love the little airplane.

01:01:21.511 --> 01:01:23.804
Who took this photograph?

01:01:23.971 --> 01:01:26.098
- A friend of mine.
- He's good.

01:01:26.265 --> 01:01:27.307
Who said it's a he?

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:30.102
Nobody. I just figured.
I mean, you look so...

01:01:30.269 --> 01:01:31.937
happy.

01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:36.942
Well, if that's all,
I really need to get to work.

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:39.277
Let's go, guys.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:41.947
You're wrong about him.

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:43.782
How's that?

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.618
This is not a man who could've done
the things you said.

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:51.456
This is a ruthless killer who committed
murder and probably will again.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.126
He'll do anything
and use anybody to escape.

01:01:54.293 --> 01:01:56.128
I'm glad you won't see him anymore.

01:02:05.722 --> 01:02:08.348
- That was good work, fellas.
- Yes, it was.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:11.059
Newman, set up a surveillance
on Ms. Bineaux.

01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:14.563
- Get a tap order for here and at work.
- He won't make that mistake.

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.815
He'll contact her.
I'll bet my Bears tickets.

01:02:19.652 --> 01:02:21.236
Sammy!

01:02:21.654 --> 01:02:22.904
Sam, Kevin Peters...

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.700
the guy who was out on sick leave,
must be the one who planted the gun.

01:02:26.868 --> 01:02:31.246
Two days before the plane crash,
his sister gets 20K in her account.

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:33.874
- Where's he at?
- Wife says he's at the gym.

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:36.168
Must have been one of those
24-minute viruses.

01:02:36.669 --> 01:02:38.670
Okay, Royce, you go with Newman.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:40.839
- Get me those U.N. surveillance tapes.
- Yeah.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:03:00.901
I haven't worked out in months.
I gotta get my fat ass back to a gym.

01:03:01.068 --> 01:03:02.861
Yeah, you're getting old.

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:04.196
And weak.

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.035
- Gym of the Living Dead?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.538 --> 01:03:13.705
Oh, hi, how you doing?

01:03:14.332 --> 01:03:16.124
U.S. Marshals.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.377
You see this guy around?

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:25.467
Mm. I think he's the last one here.
Check the showers.

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:28.887
Great, thanks. I'll go
check out over there.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.947
Kevin Peters?

01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:03.088
Cosmo! I got a dead guy here! Come on!

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:16.768
Damn! The dude we just lost is the guy
who set up the zip gun hit on the plane.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:20.814
I don't get this. What's the connection
between the Chinese and our fugitive?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:25.610
Yeah, get me the U.S. Marshal's
office. We got a homicide.

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:34.536
Where's the coffee?

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.872
Somebody's calling her
on her boss' cell phone.

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:39.165
Carla, get us a lock on that call.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.795
Bingo.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:48.675
Mark, it was horrible.
The police found me.

01:04:48.843 --> 01:04:51.052
I knew they would.
But are you all right?

01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:52.387
- Yes.
- That's good.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.723
Now, just follow the plan.

01:04:54.932 --> 01:04:57.058
This will all be over soon.

01:04:57.226 --> 01:04:58.602
It's gonna be all right.

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:00.103
We'll be together.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:01.354
Video print on that.

01:05:02.148 --> 01:05:03.982
- You have the locker key?
- Yes.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:08.486
Good. The documents are in
a briefcase. Can you bring them to me?

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:10.822
- Yeah, of course.
- That's my girl.

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:12.324
I love you.

01:05:12.575 --> 01:05:13.825
I know.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.327
I love you too, Mark.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.872
Okay. I gotta go. Bye.

01:05:28.841 --> 01:05:30.008
Okay. What have we got?

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.135
Tapes from the U.N. hit.

01:05:32.303 --> 01:05:35.764
Five cameras. I've digitized and
synchronized them. We're ready to go.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.057
Sammy, you in here?

01:05:37.224 --> 01:05:38.516
We caught a break.

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:41.937
Henry intercepted a long-distance call
from Roberts to his girlfriend.

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:44.272
We're getting the location
on the cell site.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.191
Excellent.

01:05:46.525 --> 01:05:47.525
Okay, roll them.

01:05:48.319 --> 01:05:49.986
Okay. Here we go.

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:52.864
Who's that?

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:56.534
- That's Kasinski.
- Who's Kasinski?

01:05:56.702 --> 01:05:58.703
My fellow agent,
the one that was killed.

01:05:58.871 --> 01:06:00.080
And a mystery guest.

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:03.041
I assume it's Mr. Roberts.

01:06:13.886 --> 01:06:14.970
Stop the tape.

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.557
Put that on the big screen.
Move in close.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.609
- Bingo.
- Holy shit. Sammy...

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.277
that's the Chinaman from the gym.

01:06:31.445 --> 01:06:33.363
Mr. Slice-and-Dice. Print it.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.824
All right, move on.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:43.331
Mr. Slice-and-Dice and our
mystery man have a bag exchange here.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:47.752
What do you think is in the bag?
I'll bet it's not his dirty laundry.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.923
Your friends are intercepting this.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.509
- What do you know?
- I don't know anything.

01:06:54.677 --> 01:06:58.138
Hey, Carla. Carla, Screen 6.
Yeah. Who's that?

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.349
Move it over to the big screen.
Blow it up.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:07.897
Okay, back it up.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.108
Go forward.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.112
That's Agent Harmon.

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:32.630
Lamb said they were killed in
cold blood. That looks like self-defense.

01:07:32.798 --> 01:07:33.798
What's going on?

01:07:33.966 --> 01:07:37.218
It doesn't look like
the story Lamb told us.

01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:53.359
Freeze that.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:57.363
Put that on the big screen.
Move in on the briefcase.

01:08:01.869 --> 01:08:05.205
Cosmo, how did they say
they connected our man to this crime?

01:08:05.372 --> 01:08:07.207
File said it was a fingerprint match.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.335
Yeah. Move in. Fingerprint match.

01:08:12.546 --> 01:08:16.716
Did they find his gloves in a garbage
can and turn them inside out?

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:21.429
Shit.

01:08:21.721 --> 01:08:23.348
Print it up.

01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.062
We gotta go to New York.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:39.697
What the hell are these?
And what's in New York?

01:08:40.991 --> 01:08:42.533
A rat.

01:10:48.577 --> 01:10:51.829
Now listen, Sam,
I'll do the talking, okay?

01:10:54.541 --> 01:10:58.169
Don't get up, Mr. Lamb.
You make a better target sitting down.

01:10:58.504 --> 01:11:01.256
Do I take it this visit
is not to deliver our fugitive?

01:11:01.548 --> 01:11:03.883
Not with the horseshit
you've been handing us.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.260
Excuse me?

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:09.180
John Doe's fingerprints
you had planted at the scene.

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:12.433
Want the illustrated version?

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:18.731
Would you excuse us,
gentlemen, please?

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:28.324
- Where'd you get these photographs?
- Off U.N. surveillance tapes.

01:11:28.492 --> 01:11:30.952
That is highly-classified material.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:34.205
- You know anything about this, Barrows?
- I'll look into it.

01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:37.208
Tell you what I'd look into
is how you got those fingerprints.

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:41.421
Let me save you the trouble. You had them
on file because the guy works for you.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:44.882
- Is that right or wrong?
- We want information...

01:11:45.050 --> 01:11:46.592
or I'll go Washington.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.141
The man you know as Mark Roberts...

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.601
is in fact Mark Sheridan...

01:11:55.769 --> 01:11:59.564
ex-U.S. Marine special forces,
ex-CIA black ops, recruited by us...

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.191
and until last year,
one of our kites in New York.

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:04.777
- Kite?
- Somebody who does our dirty work...

01:12:04.945 --> 01:12:06.571
without official connection.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:09.449
If something goes wrong,
the string's cut, he's on his own.

01:12:09.616 --> 01:12:12.410
Somewhere along the line,
Sheridan went bad.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:15.997
We got this from the same tapes.

01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:17.290
Who is he?

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:19.250
Hm.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:23.755
Xian Chen, People's Republic of China,
"cultural attache" to the U.N.

01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:25.965
In fact, a member of Chinese intel.

01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:29.093
For the past two years,
we've known there was a mole...

01:12:29.261 --> 01:12:31.846
in the State Department,
selling secrets to China.

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:34.932
We suspected Chen was the contact
who delivered the money.

01:12:35.434 --> 01:12:36.976
Tail on Chen led us to Sheridan.

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:40.271
Agents Kasinski and Harmon
were supposed to...

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:44.275
intercept an exchange between
Chen and Sheridan at the U.N. garage.

01:12:44.443 --> 01:12:47.111
It went south.
Sheridan was better than we were.

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:49.030
Well, better than us all.

01:12:51.658 --> 01:12:53.284
Why did you keep all this from us?

01:12:54.411 --> 01:12:57.497
Oh. Very simple. Need to know.

01:12:57.664 --> 01:13:02.293
We believed you'd quickly apprehend him
and we'd sort the issue out internally.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:06.798
Seems our confidence in
Deputy Gerard was sorely misplaced.

01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:08.383
He allowed Sheridan to escape...

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.135
and managed to get himself shot
in the process.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.932
I admit it was wrong
to withhold information from you...

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:18.935
but the fact remains,
Sheridan killed those agents.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:22.438
He's still at large.
He's armed, he's dangerous.

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:25.316
Until we have him, we won't know
the extent of the leak.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:32.365
Now you have your precious information.
What do you intend to do?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.451
Catch him.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.675
Got you, you son of a bitch.

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:59.267
I want surveillance
on the Chinese consulate.

01:13:59.435 --> 01:14:02.520
I checked the New York office.
They're setting it up now.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:04.105
Not bad for government work.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.690
No. Black canvas bag.

01:14:07.067 --> 01:14:09.402
I'm wearing the clothes on my back.

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:10.862
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:11.738 --> 01:14:13.739
- Three hours late.
- We came into La Guardia.

01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:17.952
- Oh, hi, Sam. It's nice to see you too.
- Right. Right. Look...

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:19.579
I came with four other people...

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:21.205
- Whose food is this?
- Go ahead.

01:14:21.373 --> 01:14:23.416
Well, see what you can do, please.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:27.628
Cosmo, you look so sad. Miss me?

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:31.382
No. No, I miss my new Armani jacket,
my shirts, ties...

01:14:31.550 --> 01:14:32.550
everything.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.136
You know, I hate this place already.

01:15:00.412 --> 01:15:02.413
- Sam? We're at O'Hare.
- Yeah, what's up?

01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:06.250
Marie just retrieved a briefcase
from a long-term locker.

01:15:06.418 --> 01:15:07.919
- She bought a ticket to...
- New York.

01:15:08.086 --> 01:15:12.089
- What about the cell phone trace?
- Just got it. Narrowed down to Manhattan.

01:15:12.257 --> 01:15:13.591
Third Avenue and 42nd Street.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:17.011
Get on the plane with her, Henry.
Our New York guys'll meet you at JFK.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:19.555
Third Avenue and 42nd.
We're going to work.

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:23.017
Get your stuff. We're neighbors with
Mark Sheridan. Let's go, look alive!

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.937
Listen up.
Our fugitive is in a four-block area...

01:15:26.271 --> 01:15:29.440
between 42nd and 46th Street,
1 st and 3rd Avenue.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.108
Do a full-target search.

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.353
- What can I do for you?
- Seen this guy?

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.438
No, no, sorry.

01:16:09.606 --> 01:16:11.607
He might have changed his appearance.

01:16:13.151 --> 01:16:14.652
No. Wait.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:16.654
Wait a minute, let me see that.

01:16:17.823 --> 01:16:21.200
I've seen a guy that looks like that.
Rented an apartment here a few days ago.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.493
- This guy?
- Yup.

01:16:22.869 --> 01:16:25.204
- You're sure?
- Didn't I just say that?

01:16:25.372 --> 01:16:28.332
- Give me a line.
- What's going on?

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:31.586
Sam, I got him.

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:40.344
Police! Nobody move!

01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:48.185
- He's gone.
- Nobody home.

01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.813
The dressing room's back there.

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.858
Thank you.

01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:03.367
This guy likes his toys.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.705
- Whoa, mama.
- Wow.

01:17:08.123 --> 01:17:10.041
- Good picture quality.
- Turn it off.

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:19.091
Hey, isn't that the Chinese consulate?

01:17:29.519 --> 01:17:31.062
Mark.

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:42.948
Okay, baby.

01:17:43.116 --> 01:17:44.909
We don't have much time.
They're outside.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.577
- Did you bring it?
- Yes.

01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:48.829
- Henry?
- Henry.

01:17:48.997 --> 01:17:51.749
- Where's the girl?
- Saks. She's trying on a dress.

01:17:52.376 --> 01:17:55.586
She's not trying on a dress.
He's in there with her. Get in there.

01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:56.921
Right now!

01:18:07.724 --> 01:18:08.766
Yes?

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:12.937
Excuse me, ma'am.
Just looking for a shoplifter.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.107
- Sam?
- Henry?

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:20.111
We checked the changing room.
No sign of Sheridan. Girl's on her own.

01:18:20.278 --> 01:18:24.031
Stay with her. Whatever you do,
do not lose her.

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.616
Sam.

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:30.955
Unbelievable.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.124
We're all looking for the same guy.

01:18:33.291 --> 01:18:36.293
Sam, it's Cooper. I got Chen.
He's leaving the consulate.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.254
There he is.

01:18:40.132 --> 01:18:41.799
Watch his apartment.

01:18:44.803 --> 01:18:47.304
If we got Chen,
Sheridan won't be far behind him.

01:18:47.472 --> 01:18:49.223
All right, let's hit the road.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.725
Cooper, Biggs'll pick you up.

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:54.019
Newman, we found Chen.
He just left the Chinese consulate.

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:00.067
I see him. In pursuit.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.585
He's getting in a cab.
Where are you guys? Where are you?

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.129
Heading west on 51 st Street.

01:19:20.338 --> 01:19:21.714
We'll lose him. Where are you?

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:26.010
Tired of waiting on you!

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.610
That cab on the left.
He's stopping.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.944
I got him.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.781
Sheridan could be anywhere.
Stay alive.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.209
Cosmo, Royce, take the left.
Newman, with me on the right. Move.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:15.643
- Stay on Chen.
- We're right behind him.

01:20:51.763 --> 01:20:53.764
Heads up.
Guy in the green watch cap...

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:57.226
- ...with a briefcase, looking at Chen.
- Green cap, green cap.

01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.603
What the hell is a watch cap?
Is it Sheridan?

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:02.606
- No, but grab him when he crosses.
- Yeah, yeah. We got him.

01:21:21.459 --> 01:21:22.668
Hold it, back off!

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:26.130
Watch cap just changed bags
with Chen. You follow Chen.

01:21:26.298 --> 01:21:28.007
I'll follow that bag.

01:21:28.174 --> 01:21:29.967
Bag's gotta be the bait.

01:21:33.972 --> 01:21:36.390
Taxi! Taxi!

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:38.058
Taxi!

01:21:54.159 --> 01:21:55.200
- Out of the car!
- Hey!

01:21:55.535 --> 01:21:58.829
What the hell?
What are you doing? Hey!

01:22:05.462 --> 01:22:09.632
Biggs, Cooper. We are headed north
on 3rd in a silver Cadillac.

01:22:09.841 --> 01:22:11.508
We'll find you, Sam.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:14.094
- Got him up there on the left?
- Yeah.

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:26.941
Cooper, you with me?
I'm on the 59th Street Bridge.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:30.110
We're with you.
Just coming onto the bridge now.

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:36.200
You still got Chen?

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:40.079
We're following him, he's
pulling into the Chinese consulate.

01:22:56.054 --> 01:22:58.597
- Would you mind not lighting that?
- Yes.

01:23:09.567 --> 01:23:12.444
What the hell's he doing
at the graveyard?

01:23:15.156 --> 01:23:18.242
Biggs, park here and cover this gate.

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.743
Got that, Sam.

01:23:40.098 --> 01:23:42.307
Looks like he's heading for that chapel.

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:15.924
- Well, he's not going in there to pray.
- No, sir.

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:27.955
Biggs, a cab's leaving the cemetery.
Have N.Y.P.D. pick it up.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.206
Got that, Sam.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:30.624
What's going on?

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:34.044
I don't know.
I bet Sheridan does, though.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:36.797
Sam. We're at the Chinese consulate.

01:25:37.215 --> 01:25:40.300
No sign of Chen since he went
inside. What should we do?

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:45.472
Put the N.Y.P.D. on him. I want you and
Royce here now at Queens Hill Cemetery.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.432
Where's Queens Hill Cemetery?

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:48.642
Ask a cop.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.436
- You know?
- I can get us there. Put it out.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:53.647
Throw it out. Thank you.

01:25:54.566 --> 01:25:55.858
So, what do we do now?

01:25:56.401 --> 01:25:57.901
We wait.

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:14.459
You know...

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.004
our day could be worse, right?

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.302
Is that...?

01:26:23.845 --> 01:26:25.012
Right there.

01:26:26.472 --> 01:26:28.974
It's Barrows. What's he doing here?

01:26:29.559 --> 01:26:30.893
Sam, you won't believe...

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.228
who just arrived
in a funeral procession.

01:26:33.396 --> 01:26:38.358
Agent Barrows. He's in a silver Lumina
about seven or eight cars back.

01:26:48.536 --> 01:26:51.038
- You got him?
- Yeah.

01:26:51.789 --> 01:26:53.790
- Think he's here for a funeral?
- No.

01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:05.719
- Right this way.
- Biggs, cover the west side of the chapel.

01:27:06.137 --> 01:27:07.721
Got you, Sam.

01:27:09.849 --> 01:27:11.975
Yes, ma'am. The family's right here.

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:15.646
Cosmo, where you at?

01:27:16.981 --> 01:27:19.483
I'm in traffic in New York City,
where do you think? We're on our way!

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:30.494
Go inside, be sure
there's no way out the back.

01:27:34.332 --> 01:27:37.084
"The Lord is my rock..."

01:27:37.252 --> 01:27:39.169
and my fortress...

01:27:39.337 --> 01:27:43.006
and my deliverer,
my God, my strength...

01:27:43.174 --> 01:27:45.550
in whom I will trust.

01:27:45.718 --> 01:27:49.513
My buckler and the horn
of my salvation...

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.682
and my high tower.

01:27:51.849 --> 01:27:56.603
I will call upon the Lord,
who is worthy to be praised...

01:27:57.272 --> 01:28:00.941
so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:04.111
The sorrows of death compassed me...

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:09.366
and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid.

01:28:09.534 --> 01:28:12.077
The sorrows of hell
compassed me about.

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.705
"The snares of death..."

01:28:16.374 --> 01:28:20.002
All right, people, pay attention.
We got Sheridan.

01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:22.337
Front of the chapel.
Let him go inside.

01:28:28.886 --> 01:28:30.762
Will you move?! See the lights?

01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:56.747
Son of a bitch,
why'd you do it?!

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.498
What are you talking about?

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:02.085
You don't know what I'm talking about?
You're selling secrets to China.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.755
An American response
to an invasion of Taiwan.

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:07.299
Strategic defense of South Korea.
Make sense now?

01:29:07.467 --> 01:29:10.427
Why should it? I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:12.929
- Don't lie to me!
- Don't kill me, don't kill me!

01:29:13.097 --> 01:29:15.807
- I'll do what you want.
- I won't kill you.

01:29:15.975 --> 01:29:19.686
You're gonna make me righteous again.
Why'd you set me up?

01:29:20.104 --> 01:29:21.438
Why'd you set me up?!

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:25.192
Lamb was closing in.
We needed a fall guy.

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:28.570
With you caught red-handed,
we were free and clear.

01:29:28.946 --> 01:29:30.238
"We"? Who's "we"?

01:29:30.698 --> 01:29:32.908
- I can't...
- Who is "we"?

01:29:34.243 --> 01:29:36.161
If I tell you, he'll kill me.

01:29:36.329 --> 01:29:38.205
He won't have a chance. Pick it up.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:41.124
- Come on. Let's go. Pick it up.
- Okay.

01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:43.502
- On your feet. Let's go!
- Okay, all right. Okay!

01:29:45.797 --> 01:29:48.131
- Pick them up! Pick it up, pick it up!
- Okay.

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:50.801
I got it! Don't...

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:24.626
Hold it!

01:30:34.345 --> 01:30:35.762
Shooter on the roof!

01:30:35.930 --> 01:30:38.306
Front of the chapel. I think it's Chen.

01:31:48.419 --> 01:31:51.713
Drop it or I'll drop you! Do it!

01:31:52.632 --> 01:31:54.132
Drop it!

01:31:56.594 --> 01:31:59.763
Put your hands on your head.
Put your hands on your head!

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:01.848
It's safe, Sam. We've got the shooter.

01:32:02.308 --> 01:32:03.683
Head for the front gate!

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.936
Copy that, Sam.

01:32:07.939 --> 01:32:10.690
- Cosmo, where are you?
- We're coming into Queens now.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:15.362
Sheridan's headed toward the front gate
in a black Lincoln. Try to stop him.

01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:17.948
We'll be there!

01:32:20.993 --> 01:32:23.495
- What really happened there?
- Damn it.

01:32:23.663 --> 01:32:26.164
That's it. Hell with this.

01:32:26.332 --> 01:32:28.083
Just forget it.

01:32:45.059 --> 01:32:46.101
Here we go.

01:32:48.479 --> 01:32:49.980
- Wait for him.
- Shit.

01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:09.165
You okay?

01:33:09.333 --> 01:33:12.919
Come on. Come on!
Marie, come on.

01:33:13.087 --> 01:33:14.588
He's got the girl.

01:33:14.755 --> 01:33:17.841
- We cut him off. He broadsided us.
- He's heading north.

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:19.884
He's heading north along the east wall.

01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:24.764
Here.

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:33.189
Kick it.

01:33:36.193 --> 01:33:37.193
Give me your hand!

01:33:39.530 --> 01:33:41.072
Come on!

01:33:44.869 --> 01:33:46.494
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.163
Come on! Come on!

01:33:48.372 --> 01:33:50.040
Marie, you can do it. Marie!

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:53.543
- Let me go.
- I won't leave without you. Come on!

01:33:53.711 --> 01:33:55.503
- I can't make it.
- You can make it.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.631
We won't make it, Mark.

01:33:58.215 --> 01:33:59.382
Please go.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:04.054
Go, Mark. Please. Please go.

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:18.234
Sheridan's over the wall.
Cover the street.

01:34:18.569 --> 01:34:20.111
I'm on my way!

01:34:22.156 --> 01:34:24.074
- Cuff this girl.
- Down!

01:34:24.575 --> 01:34:25.575
Down!

01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:36.211
I see him. I'm on him.

01:35:44.655 --> 01:35:47.031
We're in back of the Lorali Building.
He's inside.

01:35:47.199 --> 01:35:49.659
Move to the front, get the cops.
Seal it off.

01:35:49.994 --> 01:35:51.369
Okay.

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:54.456
Go.

01:36:17.104 --> 01:36:18.688
- Where'd he go?
- This way!

01:36:18.856 --> 01:36:19.856
- Stay here!
- What?

01:36:20.024 --> 01:36:21.858
Wait for the cops!

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:25.528
Back up.

01:36:28.157 --> 01:36:29.199
Shit.

01:36:59.730 --> 01:37:02.106
Wait! Wait!

01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.166
Sam, is everything okay?

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.836
Sam? Do you copy? Sam?

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:28.925
What the hell's all...?

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:44.190
You're all right. You won't be hurt.
Are you in here alone?

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:45.441
Yes.

01:37:50.656 --> 01:37:53.783
Sam. They're here. Coming up.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.328
- Seal and evacuate the building.
- All right!

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:16.931
U.S. Deputy Marshal. You alone?

01:38:17.099 --> 01:38:18.641
Yes.

01:38:36.619 --> 01:38:37.660
Relax.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.062
Get back.

01:39:51.777 --> 01:39:54.904
Oh, Jesus, kid. My God.

01:39:57.366 --> 01:40:02.578
This is Gerard, Room 814. I need an
ambulance. Newman has been shot.

01:40:04.581 --> 01:40:05.581
What happened?

01:40:05.749 --> 01:40:09.836
Sheridan got a shot off. Newman came in
and he just walked right into it.

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:12.255
Walked right into it. Oh, God.

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:15.258
Don't move. Don't talk.
Don't move, don't talk.

01:40:15.426 --> 01:40:18.636
Don't move. Do you copy?
I need an ambulance.

01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:21.431
You guys get your EMS people
up here right now.

01:40:24.018 --> 01:40:25.810
Hold this rag on this kid.

01:41:30.167 --> 01:41:31.667
Sheridan!

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:34.337
Sheridan! Turn it around!

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:36.923
Get down from there and face me!

01:41:37.091 --> 01:41:38.174
You'll have to shoot me.

01:41:40.594 --> 01:41:42.637
Turn around!

01:41:47.142 --> 01:41:49.185
Can't. I can't be caught.

01:42:54.626 --> 01:42:55.668
Go!

01:43:17.649 --> 01:43:21.027
This is Unit 115. We're en route
with a 32-year-old male.

01:43:21.403 --> 01:43:23.988
Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest.
Five minutes.

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:27.283
Hey, partner,
can you hear me? Can you hear me?

01:43:27.492 --> 01:43:28.868
His name is Noah.

01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:30.369
Noah, can you hear me?

01:43:30.954 --> 01:43:32.121
He's in fib.

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:35.416
Clear.

01:43:53.518 --> 01:43:55.811
You got it?
PARAMEDIC 2 Yeah, I got it.

01:43:57.564 --> 01:44:00.816
- Does he have a chance?
- No, we lost him.

01:45:39.708 --> 01:45:40.916
Ms. Walsh?

01:45:41.084 --> 01:45:43.085
Are you sure he's here? Is he here?

01:45:44.838 --> 01:45:48.257
This is Linda Carlton outside
the U.S. Mission to the U.N.

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:52.762
Many details are still unclear,
but we can now confirm...

01:45:52.929 --> 01:45:56.057
that Special Agent Frank Barrows...

01:45:56.224 --> 01:45:59.977
was killed at Queens Hill Cemetery
during a stakeout...

01:46:00.145 --> 01:46:04.482
to capture fugitive Mark Sheridan,
the prime suspect in two murders...

01:46:04.649 --> 01:46:06.650
at the U.N. six months ago.

01:46:06.818 --> 01:46:09.528
Though unconfirmed
by the diplomatic security service...

01:46:09.696 --> 01:46:12.531
sources report Barrows
may be implicated...

01:46:12.699 --> 01:46:17.078
with Sheridan in selling top-secret
documents to the Chinese government.

01:46:17.245 --> 01:46:20.122
Deputy U.S. Marshal Noah Newman
was also killed...

01:46:20.290 --> 01:46:23.542
as Sheridan eluded police
in a spectacular escape...

01:46:23.710 --> 01:46:26.796
leaping onto the roof of a
moving subway, then stealing a car...

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:30.925
He won't say anything except "diplomatic
immunity." All we can do is deport him.

01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:34.011
Antonio Kimber, one of our kites,
said he was instructed...

01:46:34.179 --> 01:46:37.306
to make the exchange.
Phone records check out.

01:46:37.474 --> 01:46:39.725
He was paged from Barrows'
office this morning.

01:46:40.394 --> 01:46:42.603
He didn't cheat, he didn't lie.
He didn't use me.

01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:43.813
I let him go.

01:46:44.439 --> 01:46:48.192
A potential breach of national
security, as this story develops.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.528
- Linda Carlton, News 2.
- Thank you, Linda.

01:46:50.695 --> 01:46:52.530
More news in less time every time.

01:46:59.204 --> 01:47:00.704
Sam?

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:06.502
Sam, I'm so sorry.

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.058
Sam, we found an abandoned car...

01:47:21.226 --> 01:47:25.271
in a park on the Jersey side of the
Holland Tunnel. This was on the seat.

01:47:26.523 --> 01:47:29.692
Guess what. We got half a latent.
Sheridan's right index.

01:47:31.403 --> 01:47:33.404
Good work, Henry.

01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.085
Something I can help you find?

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:56.177
Tetralezine...

01:47:56.344 --> 01:47:58.721
for motion sickness.

01:48:06.396 --> 01:48:07.396
- Hello?
- Cosmo?

01:48:07.564 --> 01:48:09.482
- Where the hell are you? Kim?
- Put Kim on.

01:48:10.233 --> 01:48:11.734
Line 2. Hold on.

01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.612
- Kim.
- Any ships leaving...

01:48:14.779 --> 01:48:17.364
- ...where we found the car?
- Only freighters and containers.

01:48:17.574 --> 01:48:20.075
- Any with passenger berths?
- I don't know. I'll check.

01:48:21.578 --> 01:48:23.120
Sozel Shipping has a freighter.

01:48:23.288 --> 01:48:27.082
The Utviken, loading grain in Bayonne.
It's leaving tonight.

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:29.001
Three passengers, no names.

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:32.171
Immigration didn't require it.
It's heading up through Canada.

01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:37.426
- Can you get me a helicopter?
- You got it.

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:41.597
Where's he going?

01:48:43.767 --> 01:48:46.852
- Wait. I'll call Bayonne P.D. for backup.
- I don't need them.

01:48:47.020 --> 01:48:48.395
- I'll go with you.
- No.

01:48:48.563 --> 01:48:51.440
What's the matter with you?
Look, Sam, you can't do this.

01:48:51.608 --> 01:48:54.610
I know how you feel,
I loved that kid too.

01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:57.112
But this is wrong.

01:48:58.114 --> 01:49:00.824
- I'm telling you this as a friend.
- I'm not your friend.

01:49:02.619 --> 01:49:03.661
Fine. Forget it.

01:49:05.121 --> 01:49:07.289
You wanna kill Sheridan,
go ahead, you do it.

01:49:07.457 --> 01:49:10.709
But remember this: You forget
everything you taught me about this job.

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:13.128
The rules, the regulations, the code.

01:49:13.296 --> 01:49:16.674
You do this, and it's all about you.
It's not about Newman. It's about you.

01:49:16.841 --> 01:49:18.300
The great Sam Gerard.

01:49:18.468 --> 01:49:20.427
Yes, I am.

01:49:21.012 --> 01:49:22.638
And you always have to win.

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:25.140
Yes, I do.

01:49:35.485 --> 01:49:37.236
Gonna kill him?

01:49:37.612 --> 01:49:39.612
Let's go!

01:50:09.311 --> 01:50:11.353
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:50:11.521 --> 01:50:14.565
Look right down there.
Off to the right.

01:50:15.483 --> 01:50:18.861
- That's it?
- The freighter with all the lights.

01:50:19.029 --> 01:50:20.904
I'll take her down.

01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:46.013
Yeah. Yeah, that's him.

01:50:47.015 --> 01:50:49.058
Supposed to be a couple.
Only one showed up.

01:50:49.225 --> 01:50:50.559
Where?

01:50:50.727 --> 01:50:53.646
Cabin 4, C-Deck.

01:51:26.346 --> 01:51:27.846
Freeze!

01:55:03.271 --> 01:55:04.396
Know what?

01:55:05.773 --> 01:55:07.107
You look like hell.

01:55:07.275 --> 01:55:09.818
I'm tired. I'm beat up.

01:55:11.613 --> 01:55:14.615
- Rest. I'll wake you if something happens.
- I'll be all right.

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.496
That must be the gun that shot Newman.

01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:39.348
I noticed you went with the Glock.

01:55:41.017 --> 01:55:42.559
Yeah.

01:55:43.311 --> 01:55:44.353
Just like yours.

01:55:47.690 --> 01:55:49.274
Can I see it?

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:54.488
Kind of, sort of want to emulate you...

01:55:54.656 --> 01:55:55.989
you being my mentor and all.

01:55:59.369 --> 01:56:01.578
- These things are so cool.
- Yeah.

01:56:01.746 --> 01:56:03.538
They shoot underwater.

01:56:03.831 --> 01:56:05.374
Pour sand in them, they'll shoot.

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:11.046
Shoot every time. It's a good choice.

01:56:13.091 --> 01:56:16.093
- Get some rest.
- No, I'll just get some coffee.

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.223
- Hey, you want some?
- Hey?

01:56:21.391 --> 01:56:22.891
Yeah.

01:56:23.893 --> 01:56:25.435
Black. Four sugars.

01:56:25.603 --> 01:56:27.813
This is a first.

01:56:27.981 --> 01:56:30.273
You must be truly exhausted.

01:56:30.441 --> 01:56:32.734
Oh, hey.

01:56:34.028 --> 01:56:35.404
Stairway down. Nursing station.

01:56:35.905 --> 01:56:37.990
Remember? Second floor.

01:56:58.511 --> 01:56:59.928
Officer?

01:57:03.016 --> 01:57:07.060
I need you to log this in
with evidence tech ASAP.

01:57:07.228 --> 01:57:08.937
What about him?

01:57:10.148 --> 01:57:12.566
I'm DSS. I can keep an eye on him.

01:57:12.734 --> 01:57:13.775
Thanks.

01:57:58.446 --> 01:58:01.782
Hey. You remember me?

01:58:06.954 --> 01:58:08.455
You know, you are really...

01:58:08.623 --> 01:58:12.501
on my very last nerve.

01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:16.713
You've been a mind-boggling
pain in my ass.

01:58:18.174 --> 01:58:20.842
Why couldn't you just die
at the cemetery?

01:58:21.344 --> 01:58:24.221
Or on the plane?

01:58:27.809 --> 01:58:30.477
Cut yourself out of the rest
if you want.

01:58:32.438 --> 01:58:34.064
Sit up.

01:58:34.857 --> 01:58:37.943
You know the job.
You had the same training.

01:58:38.778 --> 01:58:40.028
We eliminate threats.

01:58:40.196 --> 01:58:42.614
You are the threat.

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:43.782
And guess what.

01:58:45.910 --> 01:58:47.702
I'm down to my last option here.

01:58:50.081 --> 01:58:52.916
So...

01:58:54.127 --> 01:58:56.795
it was you. You set me up.

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:58.046
You were the traitor.

01:58:58.548 --> 01:59:01.633
Yeah. I'm the man, Mark.
You're the delivery boy.

01:59:01.801 --> 01:59:05.554
I needed a fall guy to make the bag drop
in case things went south.

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:09.307
Like the two DSS agents
you gunned down at the U.N.

01:59:09.475 --> 01:59:10.976
Their blood is on your hands.

01:59:11.144 --> 01:59:14.062
If it's any consolation,
I chose you because you're the best.

01:59:14.397 --> 01:59:17.816
That was my mistake.
But I'm gonna fix it right now.

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:20.485
You'll put that knife down
like a good boy and...

01:59:26.075 --> 01:59:27.909
Good night, Sheridan.

01:59:28.077 --> 01:59:29.661
What are you doing?

01:59:30.997 --> 01:59:33.582
- He tried to escape.
- Better shoot him, then.

01:59:34.584 --> 01:59:36.418
Wanna use your old gun?

01:59:38.296 --> 01:59:40.130
That's Sheridan's.

01:59:40.798 --> 01:59:43.842
No, it's yours.
You just filed off the serial number.

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.844
The gun he took from you
in the swamp...

01:59:46.053 --> 01:59:49.014
the gun he shot me with.
The one you've carried since.

01:59:49.182 --> 01:59:52.934
I bet the bullets we pulled from my
vest match those that killed Newman.

01:59:55.479 --> 01:59:57.647
Why did you shoot that boy?

01:59:59.483 --> 02:00:01.568
Didn't have a choice, really, Sam.

02:00:01.736 --> 02:00:04.279
He interrupted while I tried
to put two into Sheridan.

02:00:07.617 --> 02:00:08.658
Kind of like you.

02:00:11.913 --> 02:00:15.290
Go ahead, shoot. What'll your story be?
You caught me turning him loose?

02:00:17.501 --> 02:00:18.543
I'll think of something.

02:00:23.549 --> 02:00:24.841
I got yours, you got mine.

02:00:34.310 --> 02:00:35.310
Well...

02:00:37.730 --> 02:00:40.649
you're just gonna have to
cuff me and take me in.

02:00:40.816 --> 02:00:42.359
Gerard!

02:01:01.254 --> 02:01:04.005
Welcome home, Mark.
You wanna start running again?

02:01:10.054 --> 02:01:12.889
I'm going back to bed.

02:01:19.689 --> 02:01:24.943
Marshal. Is it true that Mark
Sheridan was exonerated by this hearing?

02:01:25.111 --> 02:01:26.403
After considering the facts...

02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:29.531
the U.S. Attorney's Office
has decided...

02:01:29.699 --> 02:01:33.618
to drop all charges
against Mr. Sheridan. He is...

02:01:33.786 --> 02:01:36.913
- ...free to go.
- Mr. Sheridan, how does it feel?

02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:38.873
Righteous. Very righteous.

02:01:39.625 --> 02:01:40.750
Do you have anything to add?

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:42.919
No.

02:01:48.467 --> 02:01:50.719
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry I shot you.

02:01:50.886 --> 02:01:52.512
That's okay.

02:01:57.143 --> 02:02:01.062
- Everything's back to normal, isn't it?
- God, I hope not.

02:02:07.236 --> 02:02:08.987
Excuse me.

02:02:10.781 --> 02:02:13.199
- Mr. Sheridan, please.
- Mr. Sheridan?

02:02:13.909 --> 02:02:14.951
Mr. Sheridan?

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:32.594
Hey, Sam.

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:36.765
They look like they could use a night
on the town. Take them out and have fun.

02:02:37.433 --> 02:02:40.435
Go on. That's an order. Go on.

02:02:42.355 --> 02:02:45.273
- Think you can handle that, Sam?
- Yeah.

02:03:01.248 --> 02:03:02.290
You owe me an apology.

02:03:03.125 --> 02:03:05.210
Yeah, I know.

02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:08.171
Cosmo, I know. But...

02:03:11.425 --> 02:03:12.509
But what?

02:03:15.179 --> 02:03:16.763
But I don't even like you, man.

02:03:21.560 --> 02:03:24.938
Let's go drink a toast
to Deputy Noah Newman.

02:03:25.106 --> 02:03:28.108
If we're gonna drink to Newman,
we better use milk.

02:03:28.317 --> 02:03:31.111
- You still owe me for the jogging suit.
- Of course.

02:03:31.278 --> 02:03:33.321
Make out a requisition in quadruplicate.

02:03:33.489 --> 02:03:36.991
You'll need a white copy,
yellow copy...
