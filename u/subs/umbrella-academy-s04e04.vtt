00:11.219 --> 00:13.221
[alarm klaxon wails]

00:16.016 --> 00:17.017
[muffled straining]

00:17.100 --> 00:19.769
[suspenseful music playing]

00:20.895 --> 00:23.773
[Reginald] Step lively, children.
We have a mission to do.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.817
Number One, round up the children.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.445
Let's go. Get your asses in gear.
My man, Diego.

00:28.528 --> 00:29.946
My ass is always in gear.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.656
Come on, guys. Come on.

00:33.408 --> 00:37.996
Are you kidding me, Klaus?
You just got back from rehab!

00:38.079 --> 00:40.915
[slurring] I'm California sober, Allison.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.709
Come on, guys. Just hurry up.

00:42.792 --> 00:43.752
Dad's waiting!

00:55.138 --> 00:56.014
Ben!

00:56.639 --> 00:58.975
-Why aren't you dressed?
-I'm not going.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.810
But we'll be one man down.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.605
Relax. Vanya can take my place.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.607
I wanna help you guys.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.736
-Dad?
-Narc.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.491
Number Six. Why aren't you dressed?

01:14.574 --> 01:15.950
He says he's not going.

01:22.957 --> 01:24.709
And what do you think you're doing?

01:24.793 --> 01:27.754
I just… I thought I could help
on this mission.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.217
Take that off immediately.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.302
You look ridiculous.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.021
A Moldovan arms dealer
has acquired a deadly new weapon.

01:45.647 --> 01:49.275
It's being held in a shipping container,
awaiting a buyer.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.320
Your mission is
to locate and destroy the weapon

01:52.403 --> 01:54.405
before the deal can be made.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.909
-Number One will take point.
-What about me? What should I do?

01:57.992 --> 01:59.536
Stop asking questions.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.122
Now, children, whatever you do,

02:02.205 --> 02:05.333
it is imperative that you
keep the weapon contained.

02:05.416 --> 02:09.337
Do not, under any circumstances,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.131
open the container.

02:12.132 --> 02:13.258
Is that understood?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.137
Very well.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.681
It's time, children.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.766
[suspenseful music escalating]

02:35.864 --> 02:37.323
Buckle up, children.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.908
Prepare for departure.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.858
[faint, indistinct chatter in distance]

03:15.195 --> 03:16.571
Tangos, three o'clock.

03:16.654 --> 03:18.156
[indistinct chatter continues]

03:20.909 --> 03:21.910
[Luther] Go.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.916
[suspenseful percussive music playing]

03:37.133 --> 03:39.052
Yeah, this is the one. Let's go.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.388
[dramatic music swells]

03:49.103 --> 03:50.104
[guard yells in distance]

03:51.314 --> 03:52.232
Guys!

03:53.274 --> 03:54.359
[Ben] Go, I got this!

03:54.943 --> 03:56.903
-[Luther] Are you sure?
-I got this!

03:58.196 --> 04:01.407
Okay. Diego, Allison, Klaus,
you're on me. Let's go.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.085
[delicate, uneasy music playing]

04:13.586 --> 04:14.879
[device whirs, hums]

04:14.963 --> 04:17.090
[muffled thumping]

04:23.304 --> 04:24.514
Is someone in there?

04:24.597 --> 04:26.057
[two deliberate thumps]

04:26.140 --> 04:28.142
[urgent, rousing music playing]

04:47.662 --> 04:48.997
It's okay.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.165
I'm here to help. What's your name?

04:52.500 --> 04:53.543
Jennifer.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.339
My name is Ben.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.260
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
Can you trust me?

05:06.264 --> 05:07.140
Take my hand.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.435
[Luther] Ben! What the hell are you doing?

05:10.518 --> 05:12.645
There's someone in here.
We have to get her out.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.063
That wasn't part of the plan.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.482
So what? You're gonna blow up
an innocent girl?

05:16.566 --> 05:18.860
-But Dad said--
-[Ben] I don't give a fuck what Dad said!

05:18.943 --> 05:20.153
We need to help her.

05:20.862 --> 05:21.988
[Luther] Ben, wait!

05:22.071 --> 05:23.573
-Shit!
-[clamoring in distance]

05:23.656 --> 05:25.742
Dad, we got a bit of a problem.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.035
[static crackles]

05:27.118 --> 05:27.994
Dad?

05:33.207 --> 05:35.209
[energy sparking, crackling]

05:38.546 --> 05:40.548
[forceful, dramatic music playing]

05:46.596 --> 05:48.056
[Luther] Okay, let's go. Ben.

05:48.139 --> 05:49.474
[gunshot]

05:51.100 --> 05:52.602
[chilling music playing]

05:53.603 --> 05:56.272
I told you not to open the container.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.526
Dad?

06:22.757 --> 06:23.591
Oh my God.

06:23.674 --> 06:25.009
[siblings struggling]

06:28.262 --> 06:30.932
You murdered our brother!

06:31.015 --> 06:32.141
And Jennifer.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.685
-Son of a bitch.
-[Reginald] Children!

06:34.769 --> 06:38.481
Whatever anger you may feel
towards me is misdirected.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.316
May I remind you

06:40.400 --> 06:42.819
that it was
the other Sir Reginald Hargreeves

06:42.902 --> 06:44.529
who committed this horrible act?

06:44.612 --> 06:45.905
What are you going on about?

06:45.988 --> 06:49.742
When we were kids, the "other" Hargreeves
killed Ben and Jennifer.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.245
And he had a perfectly valid reason
for doing so.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.830
They were two innocent kids!

06:53.913 --> 06:57.417
Who would have set off
a cataclysmic chain of events,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.252
leading to the extinction of all humanity.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.921
You are no different
than the other Hargreeves.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.589
You're both fucking psychopaths!

07:03.673 --> 07:05.133
It's not his fault.

07:06.008 --> 07:09.470
Reg is not responsible for what happened
to your brother and that poor girl.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.597
I am.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.683
[delicate, mysterious music playing]

07:14.517 --> 07:17.728
Years ago, I synthesized a new element.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.897
The very essence of the universe.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.482
The particle we know as marigold.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.944
And at the same moment, unbeknownst to me,

07:25.528 --> 07:27.738
a second particle was created.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.990
Durango.

07:29.073 --> 07:31.409
When marigold and durango interact,

07:31.492 --> 07:34.245
they cause… a reaction,

07:34.328 --> 07:36.038
a physical reaction.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.083
Unstoppable, irrevocable.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.295
The extinction of everything we know.

07:42.378 --> 07:43.504
The Cleanse.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.216
By the time I realized what was happening,

07:48.176 --> 07:49.969
it was too late for our world.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.888
You couldn't have known, darling.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.892
I… don't mean to be a dick and all,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.561
but what the fuck does any of this
have to do with us?

07:58.644 --> 07:59.812
[Reginald] The other particle,

08:00.396 --> 08:02.607
it is inside of Jennifer.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.234
That's why it's imperative
that none of you

08:05.318 --> 08:07.028
can come into contact with her.

08:07.653 --> 08:08.863
What happens if we do?

08:09.447 --> 08:10.740
We end the world.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.658
Saw that coming.

08:13.242 --> 08:14.494
[Luther] Uh…

08:14.577 --> 08:15.578
Guys?

08:17.830 --> 08:20.333
We… may have a problem.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.008
-Slow down.
-We've gotta keep moving.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.344
No.

08:33.262 --> 08:35.765
End of the line.
I'm not going any further with you.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.642
Where are you gonna go?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.102
I'll figure it out.

08:40.895 --> 08:41.812
[scoffs]

08:41.896 --> 08:44.315
Why did I even bother
saving your ungrateful ass?

08:44.398 --> 08:45.233
A good question.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.944
We met, what, 36 hours ago?

08:48.027 --> 08:50.947
In that time, you've killed,
like, two dozen people.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.365
Yeah, to protect you.

08:52.949 --> 08:53.824
From what?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.203
[low, menacing music playing]

08:57.286 --> 08:58.329
Do you even know?

08:59.330 --> 09:03.084
I didn't ask for any of this.
I… I don't even know what this is.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.839
But you and me, we're…

09:09.632 --> 09:11.133
we're connected somehow.

09:14.136 --> 09:15.054
Let's just…

09:15.137 --> 09:19.016
Let's get some rest,
and we can figure this out together.

09:19.892 --> 09:20.851
Please?

09:21.435 --> 09:22.937
[siren wailing in distance]

09:27.316 --> 09:29.151
Come on. We gotta move.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.827
I don't understand.
What? You just let him go?

09:37.910 --> 09:41.122
Well, how was I supposed to know
Ben was infected with this…

09:41.205 --> 09:42.957
whatever this thing is?

09:43.040 --> 09:44.792
Great work, Luther. Really great.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.420
[woman] The rash on his arm.
What did it look like?

09:47.503 --> 09:49.171
I dunno. It was just kind of…

09:49.672 --> 09:53.384
You know, it kind of looked like
that thing that Klaus caught

09:53.467 --> 09:54.927
when he came home from Ibiza.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.596
-[all groan]
-[Diego] Are you a doctor?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.639
Or do you just play one
at bachelorette parties?

09:58.723 --> 09:59.640
Hey!

10:00.141 --> 10:01.767
I am a professional dancer.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.812
Luther, was there anything unusual
about this rash?

10:04.895 --> 10:07.106
No. It was just, you know, red.

10:08.733 --> 10:09.692
And glowing.

10:11.944 --> 10:12.862
And pulsating.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.698
You didn't think maybe
that was worth bringing up?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.409
I just thought it had to do
with our powers coming back.

10:18.492 --> 10:21.203
I mean, we've all been having issues.
I know I have.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.789
I've heard enough.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.916
[distant clattering]

10:26.584 --> 10:28.461
[Lila] Whoa! What are you doing?

10:28.544 --> 10:31.088
-It's time to hunt.
-He's gonna kill Ben all over again.

10:31.172 --> 10:35.134
One of the hosts must be eliminated
before the reaction is complete.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.177
[Allison] Reaction?

10:36.260 --> 10:40.306
You do realize that you're talking about
human beings and not lab rats, correct?

10:40.389 --> 10:43.476
Reggie, please listen to your children.
You can't just murder him.

10:43.559 --> 10:45.478
She's right. There has to be another way.

10:45.561 --> 10:48.105
I understand.
You've grown attached to your brother.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.359
But you don't seem to appreciate
what's at stake here.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.569
We must act before it's too late.

10:54.612 --> 10:55.905
[grunts]

10:56.489 --> 10:58.240
[Allison] How about you shut your mouth?

10:58.824 --> 11:00.201
How dare you!

11:00.284 --> 11:01.869
I think it's high time you realize

11:01.952 --> 11:04.705
you're not running the show
here anymore, old man.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.584
Don't even think about it!

11:09.710 --> 11:11.712
[Reginald gasps, struggles]

11:12.630 --> 11:15.216
Do you think these childish theatrics
will stop me?

11:16.717 --> 11:19.178
Okay, well,
I can step it up a notch if you like.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.262
[exclaims]

11:20.888 --> 11:22.556
Viktor, please don't hurt him!

11:22.640 --> 11:26.519
Why not? Why shouldn't I?
All he does is hurt everybody else.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.814
Ben, Jennifer, me.

11:29.897 --> 11:30.940
All of us.

11:31.023 --> 11:33.192
Spare me the waterworks.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.320
One life isn't more important
than the entire planet.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.989
Oh, but your wife's is.

11:41.492 --> 11:44.453
You stuck your nose in
where it didn't belong,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.288
and you allowed Jennifer to escape.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.082
This is your fault!

11:48.165 --> 11:50.751
Oh no, no, no! This is your fault!

11:53.629 --> 11:57.633
My whole life,
all I wanted was for you to see me,

11:57.717 --> 11:59.510
to make me a part of the team.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.848
Instead, you treated me like I was broken.

12:04.432 --> 12:05.725
And I believed you.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.562
I thought you knew me
better than I knew myself,

12:09.645 --> 12:11.731
but I know now you don't know shit!

12:13.566 --> 12:15.109
You're the failure!

12:15.192 --> 12:17.528
You're the reason this happened!

12:19.071 --> 12:23.159
And I am not gonna let you kill Ben!
Not now, not ever!

12:23.242 --> 12:25.161
Am I clear? [breathing shakily]

12:29.665 --> 12:32.084
[steely, resolute music swelling]

12:34.670 --> 12:35.671
Viktor.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.256
That's enough.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.425
That's enough.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.010
[music trails off]

12:43.429 --> 12:45.431
[Viktor breathing raggedly]

12:46.474 --> 12:47.516
You and your father.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.102
Both so headstrong.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.399
[exhales sharply]

12:57.735 --> 12:59.653
You took your sweet time.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.406
-What is it?
-[indistinct whispering]

13:03.908 --> 13:04.909
[Reginald] Oh.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.369
What?

13:08.204 --> 13:10.206
[low, foreboding music playing]

13:11.749 --> 13:14.835
It seems we may have found your brother.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.591
You are in luck, my dear.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.011
Our most gifted medium is in today.

13:26.430 --> 13:27.431
[coughs]

13:31.811 --> 13:33.354
[Quinn] Looking good, champ.

13:34.563 --> 13:35.940
I'll be back in 30.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.901
Enjoy.

13:43.864 --> 13:46.575
[door locks]

13:47.910 --> 13:48.994
Please.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.623
Don't be shy. Come on in.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.252
Have a seat.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.047
Name of the deceased?

14:00.589 --> 14:02.132
Uh, Richard.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.593
-Oh.
-But he preferred Dick.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.095
Ha! Don't we all?

14:07.012 --> 14:08.889
And how old was Dick?

14:09.390 --> 14:10.599
Sixty-two.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.310
Died a month ago today.

14:13.811 --> 14:17.857
Swerved to miss a deer
and drove headfirst over a cliff.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.651
Oh God! That's tragic.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.406
Ever since, I just…

14:26.991 --> 14:30.619
I feel like he's been… haunting me.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.997
Hauntings are rare, honey.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.082
He's just stuck, is all.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.751
It's when we can't let go,

14:39.378 --> 14:40.504
neither can they.

14:41.380 --> 14:42.214
Hmm.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.769
Yes.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.814
[inhales theatrically]

14:59.815 --> 15:02.067
Beloved Dick,

15:03.235 --> 15:05.529
we are reaching out to you.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.658
Commune with us.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.535
Commune with us!

15:12.036 --> 15:14.038
Move among us!

15:15.456 --> 15:16.874
Eyes, please.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.419
Yes. Closed. Closed.
Keep 'em closed. That's it.

15:25.841 --> 15:29.678
He's… he's passing over the great divide

15:29.762 --> 15:32.222
between our world and his.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.641
Don't you feel him?

15:34.183 --> 15:36.393
I do! I do!

15:36.477 --> 15:39.271
[distraught clamoring]

15:39.355 --> 15:41.649
[piercing tone drones, fades away]

15:41.732 --> 15:42.900
[Klaus shudders]

15:44.151 --> 15:46.070
[Loretta] Is he… here?

15:47.237 --> 15:49.740
Oh, I'm here, baby. [chuckles]

15:51.033 --> 15:54.161
Well, uh… [sputtering]

15:54.244 --> 15:57.706
Tell me something
that only… only I would know.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.753
Tell her…

16:04.755 --> 16:07.758
she has an ass like a Georgia peach.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.552
[cheeky, suggestive music playing]

16:12.346 --> 16:13.180
Well,

16:14.431 --> 16:15.432
he says

16:16.934 --> 16:21.021
you have a derriere
as beautiful as a Georgia--

16:21.105 --> 16:24.692
Georgia peach! [squeals]

16:24.775 --> 16:25.901
Yes.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.737
Oh! He's here.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.370
He's with us.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.747
Can I

16:40.040 --> 16:41.333
touch him?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.085
Oh baby. Come to Daddy.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.672
Well, that part
is a little trickier, cowboy.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.050
Well, the man outside said

16:50.134 --> 16:52.720
that you would be able to provide certain…

16:54.179 --> 16:56.515
services of a…

16:58.017 --> 16:59.393
fleshly nature.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.065
It's 500 for the full service.
There's an ATM in the lobby.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.401
Come on. You're gonna charge her?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.362
I brought cash.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.740
Wonderful!

17:14.324 --> 17:15.492
All right.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.704
Hop on board, Dick.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.832
[suggestive, quirky music playing]

17:26.754 --> 17:27.588
[Klaus gasps]

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
-[grunts]
-[splat]

17:31.717 --> 17:33.510
[Klaus shivers]

17:40.142 --> 17:41.310
Dick?

17:41.393 --> 17:44.730
[as Dick, gruffly]
You bet your sweet peachy ass!

17:44.813 --> 17:47.691
Mmm! It really is you.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.904
[as Dick, gruffly]
Yeah, baby! Oh baby! I missed you!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.530
Give it to Daddy!

17:57.159 --> 17:59.161
[sirens wailing in distance]

18:03.874 --> 18:07.753
Okay. Ben is an asshole.
I'll give you that. But a mass murderer?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.339
Turned everyone into haggis.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.636
And they have terrible taste in tattoos.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.554
[Diego] Some next-level psycho shit.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.598
This could have been a rescue mission.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.017
More likely a massacre by two individuals

18:22.101 --> 18:24.394
who are growing increasingly violent
by the minute.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.938
You don't know that.

18:26.021 --> 18:29.525
All right, so my guys tell me
that this whole farm actually belongs

18:29.608 --> 18:32.319
to those two lunatics
who ambushed us at New Grumpson.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.612
Gene and Jean Thibedeau.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.823
[Luther] Well, maybe Ben killed them too.

18:35.906 --> 18:38.617
Forensics found fresh tracks
leading out of the barn.

18:38.700 --> 18:42.246
-My guess is they escaped.
-[Allison] They couldn't have gotten far.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.289
Based on the signs of rigor,

18:44.373 --> 18:47.167
I'd say time of death was
six, maybe seven hours ago.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.545
How do you know that?

18:51.421 --> 18:54.800
Wichita, PD.
Thursday nights at 9/8 Central.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.177
Ready the car.

18:58.637 --> 18:59.888
I gotta make a call.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.066
You thinking what I'm thinking?

19:12.067 --> 19:12.901
Rarely.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.945
There might be a way to stop all this.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.071
The answer is no.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.990
Hey, you didn't even
let me ask the question.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.492
I know I'm gonna hate it.
Why waste the oxygen?

19:20.576 --> 19:22.244
Why don't we use
that little time choo-choo,

19:22.327 --> 19:24.454
go back in time,
and stop the coming Armageddon?

19:25.831 --> 19:27.207
How would that work?

19:27.916 --> 19:31.545
Well, we travel back
to the original Jennifer incident.

19:31.628 --> 19:34.047
Stop your Ben from ever touching that Jen.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.510
Lila, if you recall,
we almost got our heads blown off.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.803
-Mmm.
-All right?

19:39.887 --> 19:42.139
Plus, it would never work
without a briefcase.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.766
Stop being such a baby. It's worth a shot.

19:44.850 --> 19:48.812
Clearly the rules are different this time.
Maybe we don't even need a briefcase.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.482
You must have those powers
for a reason, right?

19:53.442 --> 19:54.318
Let's use it.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.821
All right, fine.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.032
First sign of trouble, we're coming back.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.992
You do have one problem though.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.121
I don't suppose
we can explain any of this to him.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.332
He's like a sponge
that can take no more water.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.374
It's a shame.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.585
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:14.296 --> 20:15.214
Do you mind?

20:17.132 --> 20:18.008
Yeah.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.179
That thing you said earlier
about needing a break.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.015
You don't love me anymore?

20:25.599 --> 20:28.685
Of course I still love you,
but you make this so hard, Diego.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.646
What? How? What--

20:30.729 --> 20:33.523
Every day, me and the kids
have to watch you moping around the house,

20:33.607 --> 20:37.527
complaining about your life,
your job, your in-laws, your fat belly.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.029
You're just as bored as I am.

20:39.112 --> 20:42.241
Remember, you're the one
that snuck out to those Keeper meetings.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.328
[low, bittersweet music playing]

20:46.411 --> 20:50.624
I took my big bag of shit out of the house
so no one else has to deal with it.

20:52.125 --> 20:53.919
This is our life, my love.

20:56.296 --> 20:58.382
If you're not in it,
then what's the point?

21:04.221 --> 21:07.516
He must be considered
armed and extremely dangerous.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.643
Be prepared to eliminate on sight.

21:10.435 --> 21:11.478
I can save him.

21:11.561 --> 21:14.189
Look around. He's beyond saving.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.026
Don't make me put you down again.

21:20.320 --> 21:23.073
Very well, then. What's your big idea?

21:23.156 --> 21:25.575
Just give me a moment, and I can explain.

21:26.702 --> 21:27.786
-Sir?
-Mr. Five.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.622
I thought you said
you had this situation under control.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.625
The situation is proving
more kinetic than anticipated.

21:33.709 --> 21:36.628
No shit. We have
the Texas Tentacle Massacre out here.

21:37.129 --> 21:40.132
Okay, I need to know
who's responsible for this bloodbath.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.387
Well, sir, I do have a few leads,
but I need a favor before I can follow up.

21:46.805 --> 21:47.889
I'm listening.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.562
Okay, you see these two idiots over there?
Those are my brothers.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.523
Now, they're kind of stepping
all over the crime scene,

21:56.606 --> 21:58.900
asking dumb questions, getting in my way.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.322
Do you mind taking 'em back to HQ?

22:04.197 --> 22:07.075
You know, show 'em around.
Maybe let them hold some guns.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.660
[disgruntled sigh]

22:08.744 --> 22:10.203
You're asking me to babysit.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.374
You want this case solved, don't you?

22:16.501 --> 22:17.878
You owe me, Five.

22:20.630 --> 22:22.674
Diego! Luther!

22:22.758 --> 22:25.469
Come over here.
I wanna introduce you to my boss.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.971
Deputy Director Lance Ribbons.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.600
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

22:31.683 --> 22:32.642
Hello, Lance.

22:33.268 --> 22:37.022
I understand you gentlemen have
a keen interest in the CIA.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.445
I'd love to give you an insider's look,
if you're interested.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.906
-No, not really--
-Are you kidding?

22:47.115 --> 22:47.991
We're in.

22:48.492 --> 22:49.368
Good.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.204
Meet me at the office.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.004
What?

23:01.088 --> 23:02.464
Why do I have to go?

23:02.547 --> 23:04.174
'Cause he wants both of us.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.593
Come on, Luther.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.431
I really need this right now, man.
Life sucks.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.102
All right, fine.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.103
Yes!

23:17.020 --> 23:19.523
-We're gonna need suits.
-Suits?

23:19.606 --> 23:20.524
Yeah, man.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.943
Gotta look the part, playboy.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.695
Did you steal those from a dead guy?

23:32.536 --> 23:34.579
Come on. Come on, come on, Klaus.

23:36.623 --> 23:38.959
Claire? Sweetheart, what happened?

23:39.042 --> 23:41.044
[somber, aching music playing]

23:44.464 --> 23:45.465
I'm on my way.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.430
[engine idling]

24:11.199 --> 24:12.451
[attendant] Welcome to King Reg.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.287
Would you like to try
our two-for-one King Chikkadoo sandwich?

24:16.705 --> 24:21.501
Once upon a time,
I had bad oysters in Cairo.

24:25.839 --> 24:27.674
Pull forward to the window, please.

24:27.757 --> 24:30.594
[lilting, cryptic music playing]

24:40.854 --> 24:43.148
Do you know why my dog is called Rolex?

24:44.524 --> 24:46.234
Because he's a watchdog.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.117
Shut her down, hon.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.244
Yes!

25:00.832 --> 25:02.459
[attendant] Come again. Lovely to see you.

25:02.542 --> 25:05.504
So nice to see you.
Okay, thank you very much. Thank you.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.672
Okay. Bye-bye. Goodbye.

25:07.756 --> 25:08.924
Thank you, sir.

25:12.844 --> 25:13.678
Claire?

25:14.596 --> 25:16.848
-Honey, are you okay?
-I tried to stop him.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.435
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right. It's not your fault, okay?

25:21.019 --> 25:24.147
You need to understand,
your uncle has a disease.

25:24.231 --> 25:26.024
He's really, really sick.

25:26.858 --> 25:27.817
What about you?

25:28.777 --> 25:32.155
What happened to your face, Mom?
Where were you?

25:32.239 --> 25:35.033
Maybe it's time
to look at your side of the street.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.160
Excuse me?

25:37.244 --> 25:40.372
If you know this, why do you keep
letting him into your life?

25:41.540 --> 25:44.543
You need to address
your inability to set healthy boundaries.

25:45.126 --> 25:46.670
Okay, little miss.

25:46.753 --> 25:50.507
You're a little young to understand
my relationship with my brother.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.008
Jesus.

25:52.092 --> 25:54.344
Ever since we were kids,
this is what he does.

25:54.427 --> 25:57.764
He messes up. He gets in some shit.
And who does he call? Me.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.393
But he needs me.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.687
He needs us.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.733
Uncle Klaus is immortal, right?

26:09.734 --> 26:10.819
Yeah. So?

26:10.902 --> 26:15.365
So why do you keep trying to save someone
who can literally save himself?

26:18.201 --> 26:19.744
When did you get so smart?

26:20.620 --> 26:21.997
Guess I got it from my mom.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.165
[Allison chuckling fondly]

26:26.251 --> 26:27.544
[Allison] What a mess.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.091
So are we gonna go look for him or…

26:33.174 --> 26:34.801
Maybe just this once.

26:34.884 --> 26:36.261
Yeah, I'll go change.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.724
[indulgent groan]

26:40.807 --> 26:42.809
[tittering]

26:42.892 --> 26:44.811
[whimsical, raffish music playing]

26:44.894 --> 26:47.606
Five hundred bucks in 30 minutes?

26:47.689 --> 26:50.275
[Klaus laughing giddily]

26:50.358 --> 26:52.777
You know, at this rate,

26:52.861 --> 26:55.405
I'm gonna have that debt paid off
in no time.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.782
No time at all.

26:57.866 --> 26:59.200
That's what you think.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.744
Hey, what are you doing?

27:00.827 --> 27:03.038
-Hey, that's not fair!
-Hey!

27:03.121 --> 27:05.123
[menacing music playing]

27:05.749 --> 27:07.417
-That's for food.
-What?

27:07.500 --> 27:09.794
For rent. For supplies.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.046
Are you kidding me?

27:11.755 --> 27:13.757
What do you think? Sage grows on trees?

27:15.008 --> 27:15.884
Fuck.

27:16.551 --> 27:20.388
Dom's cut. Pirate's cut. My cut.

27:23.141 --> 27:26.895
And that is for the party favors
we went through last night.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.737
What's it gonna be, my little star?

27:42.160 --> 27:43.495
That's what I thought.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.873
Pace yourself.
Got a busy night ahead of you.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.209
[Quinn cackles]

27:49.292 --> 27:50.710
[door opens]

27:50.794 --> 27:51.836
Yeah, baby!

27:52.879 --> 27:54.381
[door closes]

27:54.923 --> 27:58.218
[lock rattles, clicks]

27:58.301 --> 27:59.969
[Keeper agent] Go! Go! Go!

28:00.637 --> 28:02.222
See that board over here?

28:02.305 --> 28:04.140
[animated, overlapping chatter]

28:04.224 --> 28:05.058
Let's go.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.143
[charged, dramatic music playing]

28:13.274 --> 28:14.776
[music swells, trails off]

28:14.859 --> 28:16.861
[overlapping chatter continues]

28:20.782 --> 28:22.033
[attendant clears throat]

28:22.826 --> 28:24.828
Any updates on our missing person?

28:24.911 --> 28:27.497
No, ma'am, but we are still waiting
for some teams to report in.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.165
-[Jean sighs]
-Top marks, Bea.

28:32.627 --> 28:34.129
Was there something else?

28:34.212 --> 28:37.132
Um, there's somebody asking to see you.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.510
-Name?
-[Bea] He wouldn't say.

28:40.593 --> 28:41.720
And you let him in?

28:43.138 --> 28:45.515
[haltingly] He… He knew the code phrase.

28:45.598 --> 28:47.767
[intriguing harp glissando]

28:51.980 --> 28:52.897
Bring him over.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.319
She's doing her best.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.614
[Jean] Don't you defend her.

29:08.288 --> 29:09.998
[music trails off ominously]

29:10.498 --> 29:11.916
Can we help you?

29:12.000 --> 29:13.626
I very much hope so.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.045
Denny Muntz. Red Deer chapter.

29:16.713 --> 29:17.797
Never heard of it.

29:17.881 --> 29:21.342
Well, we're small, but I assure you,
we're all true believers.

29:22.385 --> 29:25.680
You've helped so many people
find the truth, Jean.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.307
May… May I call you Jean?

29:27.390 --> 29:28.850
No, you may not.

29:28.933 --> 29:30.143
[Jean] Gene!

29:30.226 --> 29:31.686
Don't be rude.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.439
Of course you can, Mr. Muntz.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.858
-Please have a seat.
-Oh, thank you.

29:37.984 --> 29:38.943
Tight squeeze.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.287
State your business here.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.873
I want to…

29:53.333 --> 29:54.834
discuss the missing girl.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.505
[quizzical, plucky music playing]

30:02.050 --> 30:03.468
Are you hungry, Mr. Muntz?

30:03.551 --> 30:06.554
Because they have
a hell of a chicken sandwich here.

30:08.431 --> 30:09.933
-I could eat, Jean.
-Yeah.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.101
-[Jean chuckles]
-Thank you.

30:12.185 --> 30:13.311
Chikkadoo.

30:13.394 --> 30:15.230
[Sy, Jean chuckling playfully]

30:15.313 --> 30:17.315
[birds cawing]

30:25.824 --> 30:27.826
Dave, it's at the theater!

30:43.424 --> 30:44.425
[sighs]

30:56.771 --> 30:57.647
Hey.

30:59.107 --> 30:59.983
[Jennifer] Hey.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.986
Thought you were sleeping.

31:06.072 --> 31:07.115
I feel like

31:08.783 --> 31:10.243
I'm going insane.

31:13.079 --> 31:15.874
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about you since we met.

31:18.793 --> 31:19.711
Same.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.091
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

31:25.174 --> 31:27.176
[fraught, mysterious music playing]

31:30.889 --> 31:33.433
I feel like
breaking down this wall right now.

31:42.609 --> 31:43.484
Look.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.532
I appreciate you saving me
from those lunatics,

31:50.116 --> 31:51.784
but once we get some rest,

31:51.868 --> 31:54.120
I think it's best
if we go our separate ways.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.874
How am I supposed to do that?
Where am I supposed to go?

31:57.957 --> 31:59.000
Back to your family.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.002
Those people aren't my family.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.171
My family died a long time ago.

32:05.298 --> 32:06.549
Mine too.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.635
[plaintive, somber music playing]

32:18.144 --> 32:19.062
Well,

32:19.771 --> 32:21.648
if they ever even existed.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.484
What do you mean?

32:26.653 --> 32:27.946
When I was six,

32:28.696 --> 32:31.407
I was pulled out of the stomach
of a giant squid.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.494
It was on the news and everything.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.957
I was never identified.

32:41.000 --> 32:43.044
Nobody ever came to claim me.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.881
Must have tossed me overboard.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.177
It's a miracle I even survived.

33:02.563 --> 33:04.524
Ben? You still there?

33:06.067 --> 33:07.026
Look.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.613
Obviously, we're meant to be together.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.449
Me with my tentacles.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.368
You, the miracle squid girl.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.709
That has to be fate, right?

33:29.632 --> 33:30.967
What channel are you on?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.097
Six.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.975
It's The Blob.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.144
I love this movie.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.023
Me too.

33:45.732 --> 33:47.608
[person 1 on TV] No, Danny! Wait!

33:49.569 --> 33:50.778
[person 2] What goes?

33:53.489 --> 33:54.407
Okay.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.659
Do exactly what we did last time.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.286
Just ride one stop eastbound.

33:58.369 --> 34:00.705
Go up to the apocalypse timeline.

34:00.788 --> 34:04.959
Avoid getting killed,
and warp back to 2006.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.504
Stop Ben from ever going
on the Moldovan mission. Got that?

34:08.588 --> 34:10.673
Relax. It's a rookie time travel mission.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.134
-We've done this a thousand times.
-[Five sighs]

34:13.217 --> 34:17.013
But time travel-wise,
I don't get the whole subway thing, right?

34:17.096 --> 34:19.766
I'm much more of
a DeLorean kind of person, yeah?

34:19.849 --> 34:21.934
[warped voice speaking backwards over PA]

34:27.398 --> 34:28.524
Just in case…

34:29.484 --> 34:30.985
[subway alert chimes]

34:31.069 --> 34:33.071
[eerie, jarring music playing]

34:34.530 --> 34:35.531
After you.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.542
[warped voice speaking backwards over PA]

34:50.129 --> 34:51.881
[Klaus forcefully rattling windows]

34:51.964 --> 34:52.924
Shit!

34:53.007 --> 34:54.425
[door rattling]

34:54.509 --> 34:56.052
Oh, goddamn it!

35:02.308 --> 35:04.310
The lady is back for more.

35:04.393 --> 35:06.729
Oh, hello.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.231
[Quinn] Look at you.

35:08.314 --> 35:11.067
Stacking up repeat customers already.

35:16.656 --> 35:17.865
So,

35:19.117 --> 35:19.992
more Dick?

35:21.661 --> 35:22.787
Yes, please.

35:26.165 --> 35:29.252
Our beloved Ricardo.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.964
Come back for round two.

35:33.047 --> 35:34.465
[theatrically] Commune

35:35.424 --> 35:36.759
with us

35:37.677 --> 35:39.345
once more.

35:41.389 --> 35:43.391
[tense music playing]

35:43.474 --> 35:45.560
[Klaus shuddering]

35:52.984 --> 35:56.195
[as Dick] Oh, I knew
you couldn't stay away, baby.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.281
[tittering]

36:01.075 --> 36:02.076
[grunts]

36:02.160 --> 36:03.244
[hearty laughter]

36:03.327 --> 36:05.746
-What's gotten into you?
-Shut your mouth.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.541
Where's the money, Richard?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.877
What? What money?

36:12.086 --> 36:13.504
Don't play dumb with me.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.757
I checked the safe deposit box.

36:17.258 --> 36:18.134
It's gone.

36:19.343 --> 36:21.888
I don't know what you're talking about!

36:21.971 --> 36:22.805
[winces]

36:22.889 --> 36:24.390
-[pained laughter]
-Uh-huh.

36:25.641 --> 36:30.396
You know, for 20 years, I stood by,
and I watched you squander our money

36:30.479 --> 36:32.106
to dice and hussies.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.235
And I will be damned
if I let you take it to the grave.

36:38.738 --> 36:39.906
Where is it?

36:40.907 --> 36:43.159
[wheezy laughter]

36:43.242 --> 36:47.371
I'll never tell you, you heartless whore.

36:48.206 --> 36:49.415
-[fleshy crunch]
-[gasps]

36:49.498 --> 36:51.500
[somber, inquisitive music playing]

37:00.426 --> 37:01.260
Dick?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.722
Dick? Dick?

37:07.183 --> 37:08.267
[as Klaus] He's gone.

37:10.519 --> 37:15.191
[weakly] Oh, can you please
unhand my… my treasures, please?

37:15.274 --> 37:17.276
[Klaus groaning] Ow!

37:20.696 --> 37:23.324
Well, that was a waste.
I'm not paying for that.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.160
I know.

37:27.245 --> 37:29.080
I know where he hid the money.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.709
And I'll tell you.

37:33.793 --> 37:37.046
But first, you gotta help me
get the hell out of here.

37:37.129 --> 37:38.547
[intriguing music playing]

37:38.631 --> 37:40.007
Start talking.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.593
The brooch.

37:44.637 --> 37:47.306
Give me the brooch,
then I'll tell you the location.

37:48.724 --> 37:49.725
[pounding at door]

37:49.809 --> 37:51.269
[Quinn] What's going on in there?

37:51.769 --> 37:54.981
All right.
It's the First National Bank of Zurich.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.901
-Passcode?
-Brooch first.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.321
The password is "Thunderbolt."

38:04.156 --> 38:05.241
[laughs]

38:05.324 --> 38:08.202
Oh, he always loved that damn dog
more than me.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.745
[door rattling]

38:15.293 --> 38:16.585
That was pretty fast.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.796
It was quite good.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.883
-[Klaus] See you next time.
-Toodle-oo.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.179
Cha-ching.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.314
[door locking]

38:38.524 --> 38:40.526
[quirky, winsome music playing]

38:44.905 --> 38:46.032
[Diego giggles]

38:49.076 --> 38:50.661
Not bad, not bad.

38:51.370 --> 38:55.541
Oh, just be careful with that tie.
Tends to end up in your G-string.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.336
Wait, you're wearing a G-string?

38:59.462 --> 39:00.379
You're not?

39:01.589 --> 39:03.132
-Never mind. Come on.
-Wait.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.093
What are we doing here anyway?

39:06.177 --> 39:09.847
We should be out there finding Ben,
not holed up in some office.

39:09.930 --> 39:11.849
-Some office?
-Yeah.

39:12.558 --> 39:13.726
Luther,

39:13.809 --> 39:19.565
you're standing in the heart of
the most powerful intelligence apparatus

39:19.648 --> 39:21.859
in the history of the world!

39:23.069 --> 39:24.028
I mean,

39:25.029 --> 39:26.822
intelligence, bro.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.742
This is how we find Ben.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.287
[quirky music continuing]

39:39.585 --> 39:41.003
[vibrant musical flourish]

39:41.087 --> 39:42.213
He's just excited.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.131
[subway alert chimes]

39:44.215 --> 39:46.550
[warped voice speaking backwards over PA]

39:46.634 --> 39:50.137
Okay. Broken vending machine. Australia.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.932
Three burnt-out light bulbs.

39:53.015 --> 39:55.267
See? Your poetry book came in handy.

39:56.394 --> 39:57.436
All right.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.065
Knowing me, I probably set a trap,
so be careful.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.495
[gloomy, mysterious music playing]

40:15.454 --> 40:17.456
All right. There's no sign of him.

40:18.082 --> 40:21.210
Okay. Well, let's get going
before you start farting.

40:22.002 --> 40:22.920
Yeah.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.256
Ready? 2006, here we come.

40:32.513 --> 40:33.514
Did it work?

40:34.640 --> 40:35.724
Are we here?

40:36.559 --> 40:37.560
I don't know.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.729
October 14, 2006.

40:41.355 --> 40:42.982
Great. Okay.

40:43.065 --> 40:45.067
So we go in, we snuff Ben out,

40:45.151 --> 40:47.778
we get back on the tube,
we're back before bath time.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.363
We're not here to kill him, Lila.

40:49.447 --> 40:52.867
We're just diverting him. Making sure
he doesn't go on the Moldova mission.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.995
-Mmm.
-I haven't seen him in, like, five years.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.956
So he might be a little jumpy.
Just play it cool.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.791
Like polar bear nipples.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.835
-[klaxon blaring]
-Oh shit!

41:05.880 --> 41:09.091
Step lively, children.
We have a mission to do.

41:09.675 --> 41:11.677
Number One, round up the children!

41:12.636 --> 41:15.181
Let's go. Get your asses in gear.
My man, Diego.

41:15.264 --> 41:16.849
My ass is always in gear.

41:17.975 --> 41:19.226
[Luther] Come on, guys.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.978
-[Klaus giggling]
-Are you kidding me?

41:21.061 --> 41:22.813
You just got out of rehab.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.524
[Klaus] I'm California sober, Alphonso.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.152
Alphonso?

41:32.531 --> 41:33.782
Umbrellas.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.244
Sparrows.

41:38.078 --> 41:40.164
-Who's that?
-We're in the wrong timeline.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.624
-We need to go.
-Hey!

41:42.583 --> 41:44.668
-Who the hell are you?
-[Lila] Rude.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.546
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

41:48.422 --> 41:50.591
[snorts] We're the Phoenix Academy.

41:50.674 --> 41:52.218
And we're about to fuck you up.

41:54.678 --> 41:55.596
[Lila laughs]

41:55.679 --> 41:57.097
Okay, slight hiccup.

41:57.723 --> 41:58.724
[Five] You think?

41:59.725 --> 42:02.102
Okay. Well, look.
We're in the wrong timeline,

42:02.186 --> 42:03.979
but clearly, we're in the neighborhood.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.523
Neighborhood of what?

42:05.606 --> 42:07.608
Christ, I never should have
listened to you.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.902
Chill out, Five!

42:09.985 --> 42:12.404
We'll figure it out, okay? You know why?

42:12.488 --> 42:14.406
Because someone brought a map.

42:14.490 --> 42:15.866
-Hmm.
-[Lila laughs]

42:16.367 --> 42:17.284
All right.

42:19.828 --> 42:20.913
Look, we're here.

42:21.497 --> 42:24.500
Take this train three stops
to this squiggly line.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.753
Transfer at the division symbol.

42:29.713 --> 42:30.589
Oh fuck!

42:31.298 --> 42:32.424
Oh no, wait!

42:33.008 --> 42:34.301
We're here.

42:35.135 --> 42:37.012
Two stops on the ampersand.

42:37.596 --> 42:39.807
-No more winging it.
-Is that an umlaut or an ablaut?

42:39.890 --> 42:41.809
Let's get back to where we came from.

42:41.892 --> 42:44.395
[warped voice speaking backwards over PA]

42:44.478 --> 42:45.479
Now!

42:46.605 --> 42:48.607
-Hey!
-What? Do you wanna miss the train?

42:48.691 --> 42:52.236
Well, who made you in charge?
Jesus! You were gonna leave without me.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.656
[cheeky, mysterious music playing]

42:58.576 --> 42:59.702
All right.

42:59.785 --> 43:00.995
Come to Mama.

43:01.620 --> 43:02.705
Come on, baby.

43:03.330 --> 43:04.748
[lock clattering]

43:04.832 --> 43:06.834
[door rattling, opening]

43:12.506 --> 43:14.300
Oh, oh, oh!

43:16.010 --> 43:16.885
Wait.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.887
Yes! [gasps]

43:18.971 --> 43:22.182
Sweet delicious Jesus, you bitch!

43:22.266 --> 43:23.267
Come to Mama!

43:23.350 --> 43:24.268
[music halts]

43:24.351 --> 43:26.353
[indistinct chatter in distance]

43:27.062 --> 43:29.523
[cheeky music resumes]

43:33.986 --> 43:35.070
Oh freedom.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.072
Freedom.

43:37.990 --> 43:39.825
All right, baby, freedom.

43:41.660 --> 43:42.661
[rough scraping]

43:42.745 --> 43:44.747
[sprightly, puzzling music playing]

43:50.628 --> 43:52.129
[Klaus strains, groans]

43:57.176 --> 43:59.053
Goddamn you, Thunderbolt.

44:00.846 --> 44:01.847
[thud]

44:06.268 --> 44:07.186
Bingo.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.482
[music trails off]

44:11.565 --> 44:12.900
What do we got here?

44:12.983 --> 44:15.319
-[bag unzipping]
-This isn't a dog corpse.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.237
[gasping]

44:21.116 --> 44:22.993
[giddy laughter]

44:27.164 --> 44:29.500
Oh my God!

44:30.793 --> 44:31.710
[smooches]

44:31.794 --> 44:34.421
Thank you, thank you, Thunderbolt.

44:35.631 --> 44:36.590
Surprise.

44:37.633 --> 44:38.676
How did you--

44:38.759 --> 44:41.720
Oh, Richard never trusted banks, sweetie.

44:41.804 --> 44:43.597
And I knew that you were fibbing.

44:43.681 --> 44:47.518
So I waited till you got yourself free,
and I followed you here.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.980
Well, you are right on time.

44:52.481 --> 44:54.525
Very, very punctual.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.570
How about we call it a 50/50 split?

44:58.654 --> 45:00.447
I mean, that seems fair to me.

45:01.490 --> 45:05.619
I'm more than happy
to just take my finder's fee

45:05.703 --> 45:09.373
slash digging-for-several-hours fee

45:09.456 --> 45:11.542
and be on my merry way, all right?

45:11.625 --> 45:14.002
How about I shoot you

45:14.878 --> 45:16.004
in the face?

45:16.088 --> 45:17.756
Just… [Klaus sighs]

45:18.590 --> 45:19.508
All right.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.138
I could probably get down to, uh…

45:25.222 --> 45:26.348
0%.

45:26.432 --> 45:29.017
-I could probably live with that.
-Yeah.

45:29.101 --> 45:30.686
-[vehicle approaching]
-Just take it.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.147
[biker] Right there. I see 'em.

45:33.647 --> 45:36.233
Always good to keep a rat around,

45:36.859 --> 45:38.527
'cause they sniff out the cheese.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.821
Okay, back up. This is my estate.

45:41.321 --> 45:44.324
-That's what you think.
-[Loretta] Run out of people to pimp?

45:44.408 --> 45:46.452
-What are you doing?
-[Quinn chuckles] Funny, lady.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.746
You find that gun in a Cracker Jack box?

45:48.829 --> 45:50.664
[Loretta] Had to bring
your big boys with you?

45:50.748 --> 45:51.665
[Quinn] That's right.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.751
How about I put a hole in that jacket?

45:53.834 --> 45:54.835
[Loretta] Try it.

45:55.878 --> 45:58.088
-[gunfire]

-[bodies tumbling]

46:19.777 --> 46:21.695
Oh my God!

46:24.865 --> 46:27.451
I was so not expecting that.

46:29.912 --> 46:31.747
Oh, well. All right.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.166
Oh, Quinn!

46:34.249 --> 46:36.210
[menacing music playing]

46:36.794 --> 46:38.796
Thank God you're alive!

46:40.047 --> 46:43.050
Guess you found a way
to finally pay that debt off.

46:45.052 --> 46:47.304
So we're even now, right?

46:47.805 --> 46:48.722
Yeah.

46:49.389 --> 46:50.974
Can you give me a hand, please?

46:51.058 --> 46:53.143
-You want a hand? Yeah?
-Yeah.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.812
Here's your fucking hand.

46:58.982 --> 46:59.983
[music trails off]

47:00.067 --> 47:01.193
Fucking tweaker.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.239
Ow! Ow, that hurt.

47:07.741 --> 47:10.077
Ha ha! Very funny.

47:10.828 --> 47:14.498
Quinn, could you open this goddamn lid?

47:17.292 --> 47:18.210
Quinn!

47:19.670 --> 47:21.046
[gravelly scraping]

47:21.129 --> 47:23.131
[scattershot clattering]

47:26.385 --> 47:27.344
Quinn.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.765
-[pounding on lid]
-Quinn! Stop playing around! Open…

47:31.849 --> 47:32.808
[chilling music playing]

47:32.891 --> 47:34.017
Quinn! Open up!

47:34.101 --> 47:35.561
Open up! Open up!

47:35.644 --> 47:37.771
[Quinn] A year or two should do the trick.

47:38.272 --> 47:40.732
[Klaus, desperately] Please help! Help me!

47:40.816 --> 47:42.442
Help me!

47:42.526 --> 47:43.819
Help!

47:43.902 --> 47:45.821
Help me, please! Someone!

47:45.904 --> 47:46.989
[music intensifies]

47:47.072 --> 47:48.240
Help!

47:48.323 --> 47:49.324
[music halts abruptly]

47:49.867 --> 47:52.619
Let's hear it, then. Your brilliant plan.

47:53.203 --> 47:55.706
-I can remove Ben's marigold.
-That's not possible.

47:55.789 --> 47:57.124
I've done it before.

47:58.792 --> 48:00.419
I assume it wasn't without risk.

48:01.753 --> 48:04.923
-It had its challenges.
-Then why would you want to do it again?

48:05.841 --> 48:07.426
'Cause he's my brother.

48:07.926 --> 48:09.094
A meaningless connection.

48:10.262 --> 48:11.221
You're wrong.

48:11.305 --> 48:12.347
Really?

48:15.726 --> 48:18.937
You never did understand
what it means to be a part of a family.

48:19.438 --> 48:21.273
And thank goodness for that.

48:21.899 --> 48:24.067
You children bicker constantly.

48:24.151 --> 48:25.027
Yeah!

48:25.736 --> 48:28.113
Yeah. And we drive each other crazy.

48:28.196 --> 48:31.325
That's why I moved
as far away from them as possible.

48:31.825 --> 48:35.412
But when things go to hell,
which inevitably they do,

48:36.747 --> 48:37.873
they're there for me.

48:39.207 --> 48:42.794
More evidence
humans are an inferior species.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.882
If that's what you think,
I feel sorry for you.

48:47.382 --> 48:49.092
Spare me your pity, boy.

48:49.176 --> 48:53.847
Even with your powers,
I am your superior in every way.

48:57.351 --> 48:58.352
Maybe.

49:00.145 --> 49:03.273
But in every timeline,
you're also a complete asshole.

49:24.711 --> 49:25.712
That was our stop.
