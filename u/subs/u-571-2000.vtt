Joanie, this is Andy Tyler.

Hello.
My best friend.
We went to Annapolis together.

Nice to meet you.
Hey, I got you
one of Larson's stogies.

Thank you.

Hello there,
Prudence, Louise.
Mrs. Dahlgren, Captain.

Where's your date, Andy?
It's not like you
to arrive stag.

10:34.298 --> 10:37.893
I'm afraid I couldn't get one
on such short notice, ma'am.

10:38.002 --> 10:39.902
Captain, could I have
a word with you?

10:40.004 --> 10:43.167
Certainly. Darling,

Okay.

With all due respect, sir,
there's only one way
that could've happened,

11:05.496 --> 11:08.522
and that's if you withheld
your recommendation.

11:08.632 --> 11:12.329

I just don't think
you're ready.

11:12.436 --> 11:15.928

I'm not ready?

11:16.040 --> 11:20.739

in every area and then some.

has higher marks than I do.
Andy!

to take on a command
of your own.

15:34.131 --> 15:37.032
No, we're not.

<i>How deep does

23:10.587 --> 23:13.522
She'll go all the way
to the bottom
if we don't stop her.

23:13.623 --> 23:16.353
Normally we try not to get
below 150 feet.

23:16.459 --> 23:18.450
Any deeper, the leaks
overwhelm the pumps.

23:18.561 --> 23:21.223
<i>These S-boats are antiques,</i>

23:21.331 --> 23:23.231
<i>older than most of the crew.</i>

23:53.029 --> 23:55.020
<i>Last night, at 0300 hours,</i>

23:55.131 --> 23:58.999
<i>a British destroyer reported
depth charging and sinking
a German U-boat.</i>

However,

24:01.604 --> 24:06.041
Allied direction finding
stations triangulated
a coded enemy radio signal...

24:06.142 --> 24:09.339
to this position here,
near the chop line.

24:09.446 --> 24:12.244
We believe the U-boat
was disabled, not sunk,

24:12.348 --> 24:15.146
and is drifting eastward
on a four-knot current.

24:15.251 --> 24:18.311
<i>Now, French resistance reported
a resupply submarine...</i>

24:18.421 --> 24:21.720
sailed from the Lorient U-boat
pens yesterday afternoon,

24:21.825 --> 24:23.725
with engine parts
and mechanics.

24:23.827 --> 24:27.319
We believe
it's gonna rendezvous
with the disabled U-boat.

24:28.765 --> 24:31.996
On board that U-boat is this.

24:35.572 --> 24:39.133
- A typewriter?
- An Enigma code machine.

24:39.242 --> 24:42.973
It allows the German navy
to communicate with
its submarines in secret,

24:43.079 --> 24:47.175
and our inability
to decipher their messages
is costing us this war.

24:47.283 --> 24:52.152
Mr. Coonan?
All right, this is basically
a Trojan Horse operation.

24:52.255 --> 24:57.022
The S-33 will rendezvous
with the U-boat, posing as
the German resupply sub.

24:57.126 --> 25:01.028
I will lead a boarding party
dressed in Kriegsmarine uniforms
to the enemy submarine.

25:01.130 --> 25:04.099
<i>We will take it by force
and secure the Enigma.</i>

25:04.200 --> 25:08.068
Any German survivors
will be transferred to the S-33,
and the U-boat will be scuttled.

25:08.171 --> 25:10.833
The German resupply submarine
will arrive at the rendezvous...

25:10.940 --> 25:14.137
and will assume
that the U-boat succumbed
to its wounds and sank.

25:14.244 --> 25:16.542
The Germans must never suspect
we have the Enigma.

25:16.646 --> 25:19.444
<i>That is vital.
So it's a race?</i>

25:19.549 --> 25:22.211
<i>Yes, effectively.
Who's the boarding party?</i>

25:22.318 --> 25:24.582
Well, since you're the X.O.,
you, sir.

25:24.687 --> 25:27.747
Mr. Emmett, Mr. Larson,
Mr. Hirsch and nine
of your ship's company.

25:27.857 --> 25:30.883
<i>The captain, of course,
will remain onboard the S-33.</i>

25:30.994 --> 25:36.762
Mr. Coonan, our boys
are submarine sailors,
not combat Marines.

25:36.866 --> 25:38.834
The boys onboard that U-boat
are sailors too.

25:38.935 --> 25:42.871
Your men'll be
ready, Lieutenant.
I'll train them myself.

25:42.972 --> 25:45.907
You've come
to the right boat.

27:26.743 --> 27:28.904
<i>[Man Continues Shouting]</i>

27:39.622 --> 27:42.147

and food!

27:46.629 --> 27:48.529
<i>We just want to get home!</i>

27:53.102 --> 27:58.005
Give us a hand!

27:58.107 --> 28:00.337
<i>We have no...</i>

28:27.203 --> 28:30.536
<i>I'm telling you, she was hotter

28:30.640 --> 28:34.770
<i>Really?
Yeah, I could tell
she was interested,</i>

28:34.877 --> 28:37.243
but she was classy,
you know?

28:37.346 --> 28:40.406
The type of girl
that wants you to take her
to a country club dance.

28:40.516 --> 28:43.679
<i>Yeah? Like you've ever seen
the inside of a country club?
Hey!</i>

28:43.786 --> 28:46.755
<i>Like I'd even want to,
all right?</i>

28:46.856 --> 28:50.257
<i>Anyway, I can see
I'm not getting anywhere
with her,</i>

28:50.359 --> 28:54.227
<i>so what I do is,
I use my secret weapon.</i>

28:54.330 --> 28:57.527
<i>I tell her about the S-26.
Does the trick right away.</i>

28:57.633 --> 29:00.898
Don't be talking about that
while we're underway.

29:01.003 --> 29:03.403
Why? What happened
with the S-26?
Yeah, what happened?

29:03.506 --> 29:07.306
<i>You guys don't know?
No.
No.</i>

29:08.778 --> 29:12.737
She was running a test dive
down off Norfolk.

29:12.849 --> 29:15.317
Shaft seal failed.

29:15.418 --> 29:18.785
<i>She sunk to 400 feet.</i>

29:18.888 --> 29:21.823
Know how much water pressure
there is that deep?

29:36.706 --> 29:39.937
Mazzola, you will be
the first one eating
powdered eggs on this cruise.

29:40.042 --> 29:43.443
<i>Keep it up, you hear?</i>

29:48.785 --> 29:50.685
<i>[Knocking]
Come in.</i>

29:56.492 --> 30:00.019
This is our position, Captain.
We're still bucking
some pretty heavy seas.

30:00.129 --> 30:03.621
I estimate us to be
about three hours
behind schedule.

30:03.733 --> 30:06.133
I told Mr. Emmett
to run at flank speed
and hold off a trim dive...

30:06.235 --> 30:10.137
until we make up
the lost time.
That's fine, Lieutenant.

30:12.341 --> 30:15.174
You're a first-rate X.O.,
Andy.

30:15.278 --> 30:17.178
A damn good submariner.

30:20.183 --> 30:22.845
I know the men like you.

30:22.952 --> 30:24.920
I'd give my life
for any one of them, sir.

30:25.021 --> 30:29.253
I know you would.
I'm not questioning
your bravery.

30:29.358 --> 30:31.758
The question is:
What about their lives?

30:34.197 --> 30:37.098
You and Mr. Emmett
are good friends.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.294
You went to the Academy
together.

30:40.403 --> 30:43.395
Would you be willing
to sacrifice his life?

30:43.506 --> 30:46.498
<i>Or what about
some of the younger
enlisted men?</i>

30:46.609 --> 30:49.942
You know,
a lot of those guys look up
to you like a big brother.

30:50.046 --> 30:52.105
You willing to lay
their lives on the line?

30:55.318 --> 30:58.185
You see?
You hesitate.

30:58.287 --> 31:01.620
But as a captain, you can't.

31:01.724 --> 31:03.783
You have to act.

31:03.893 --> 31:06.885
If you don't, you put
the entire crew at risk.

31:06.996 --> 31:11.524
<i>Now that's the job.
It's not a science.</i>

31:11.634 --> 31:16.401
<i>You have to be able to make
hard decisions, based on
imperfect information.</i>

<i>Asking men to carry out orders
that may result in their deaths.</i>

31:20.376 --> 31:25.871
<i>And if you're wrong,
you suffer the consequences.</i>

31:25.982 --> 31:29.474
If you're not prepared
to make those decisions...

31:29.585 --> 31:34.648
without pause,
without reflection,

31:34.757 --> 31:37.817
then you've got no business
being a submarine captain.

31:43.599 --> 31:47.000
<i>Tell Mr. Hirsch
I'd like a word with him,
would you?</i>

31:50.072 --> 31:51.972
Aye, sir.

32:55.438 --> 32:58.896
<i>More soup, Captain?
Thank you.</i>

32:59.008 --> 33:02.102
I wish I was going
with you, gentlemen.

33:02.211 --> 33:05.271
I feel the same way
you do, Carson.

33:05.381 --> 33:08.111
Gentlemen, I'd like
to propose a toast.

<i>Chief says we've picked up

34:56.625 --> 34:58.525
Aye, Captain.

Trigger, get on the helm!

50:48.510 --> 50:50.705
<i>Mazzola, take the planes!
Aye, sir.</i>

50:50.812 --> 50:52.780
<i>[Chief]
Wentz, what about these?
I don't know.</i>

50:52.881 --> 50:56.783
There's no label!
Okay, those are the aft
ballast tanks vents!

50:56.885 --> 50:59.877
These are the midship vents,
and these are the main
induction valves.

50:59.988 --> 51:03.048
<i>[Chief]
Make sure they're shut.
Tank, I need speed!</i>

51:03.158 --> 51:05.149
<i>Get the screws turning.</i>

51:05.260 --> 51:08.559
<i>The lights are on, so there's
got to be some power left.
I can't read this!</i>

51:08.663 --> 51:12.394
Rabbit, find out how many fish
we've got in the tubes!
Figure out how to launch 'em!

51:12.500 --> 51:14.331
<i>Go!
I can't read this!</i>

51:14.436 --> 51:19.840
Go help Tank, Hirsch.
Go, Hirsch!
Find the Christmas tree.

51:19.941 --> 51:22.341
<i>We've gotta make sure we don't
have any holes in the boat!</i>

51:22.444 --> 51:25.072
<i>"Klar, klar, klar."
Wentz, what the hell is "klar"?</i>

51:25.180 --> 51:29.116
"Klar" means "clear."
All compartments secure.

53:08.783 --> 53:11.877
- Watch your depth.
She'll squat.
- Rabbit!

53:14.088 --> 53:16.784
We got four fish. Tubes

Equalizing valves!

No, drainage.
Drainage. No.

<i>- We missed an interlock.
- Rabbit, get those fish out

54:53.554 --> 54:55.545
Look for "impulse air"

<i>[Tank]

59:28.729 --> 59:31.789
We've decided on a course.

We're headin' for England,

59:40.207 --> 59:44.906
Just one. It's in

bleedin' air from somewhere.

59:45.012 --> 59:48.607
- Sir?
- Yeah, what is it, Trigger?

59:48.716 --> 59:51.048
Can't we just use the radio...

59:51.152 --> 59:53.313
fire off a Mayday
and wait for a rescue?

59:53.421 --> 59:55.321
<i>[Hirsch]
That's impossible.</i>

59:55.423 --> 59:58.415
If we transmit,
the Germans will direction-find
our position to a grid...

59:58.526 --> 01:00:00.824
with their missing
two U-boats.

01:00:00.928 --> 01:00:04.625
If they even suspect we have
the Enigma, they will change
their entire coding system.

01:00:04.732 --> 01:00:08.099
<i>And that would completely
negate the purpose
of our mission.</i>

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:10.136
Mr. Tyler,

01:00:10.237 --> 01:00:12.137
if we head for England,

01:00:12.239 --> 01:00:14.264
we're gonna go straight through
the western approaches.

<i>He's right. I mean,
that's Jerry's backyard.
[Tyler] Listen, guys.</i>

And we've got nothing
to defend ourselves with.

01:00:23.384 --> 01:00:26.649
Do you think I got
all the answers here?

01:00:26.754 --> 01:00:30.781

get out of this? I don't.
I don't know how.

- I say we use the radio.
- Nobody asked you.

01:04:21.186 --> 01:04:23.245
Of course, Chief.

01:04:23.355 --> 01:04:26.051
This is the navy,

01:04:26.158 --> 01:04:29.821
where a commanding officer
is a mighty and terrible thing...

01:04:29.928 --> 01:04:31.828

and respected.

Those three words will kill
a crew, dead as a depth charge.

You're the skipper now,

01:04:46.645 --> 01:04:50.513
