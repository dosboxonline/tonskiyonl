[energy resonates]

01:06.691 --> 01:10.361
[dramatic music swells]

01:16.826 --> 01:19.537
[man 1] Ain't no cause
to make a building like this.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.539
[man 2, in Japanese]
Have you ever been called arrogant?

01:21.623 --> 01:24.167
I don't know what that means,
but these plans is bizarre.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.628
[in Japanese] That's all there is to it.
Follow the blueprint.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.005
[man 1] I said,
I don't understand these plans,

01:29.089 --> 01:30.381
I don't understand you.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.012
[ticking]

02:35.280 --> 02:36.406
[bell dings]

02:57.302 --> 02:58.386
When the job is done.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.055
-You want 'em all dead?
-All dead.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.977
[weapons cocking]

03:12.650 --> 03:15.904
[droning]

03:18.865 --> 03:19.824
Back in a flash.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.885
[watch ticking faintly]

03:42.513 --> 03:43.765
[gunshot]

03:44.557 --> 03:45.808

03:47.727 --> 03:52.774
[scattered gunfire]

03:54.067 --> 03:55.068
[hinge creaks]

03:56.945 --> 04:00.448
All dead. All dead. All dead.

04:00.531 --> 04:03.243
[panting]

04:03.993 --> 04:06.955
[groaning]

04:13.211 --> 04:15.672

04:25.306 --> 04:27.183
[distant snarling]

04:37.735 --> 04:40.154
[glass shattering]

04:40.238 --> 04:43.283
[distant explosions booming]

04:55.628 --> 04:59.465
So, how is it that we're still here,

04:59.549 --> 05:02.510
but the whole of the universe
is going down the cosmic shitter?

05:03.845 --> 05:06.431
-Maybe we're the last to get flushed.
-Wasn't talking to you.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.225
Hey, has anyone seen Klaus?

05:11.102 --> 05:12.770
-Or Dad?
-[Diego] They'll be here.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.149
Really? Did they… hit traffic?

05:16.232 --> 05:20.945
Look, people, we're alive
because we're special, right?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.531
We're the only ones
who can save the universe.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.033
-Uh, question.
-Yes.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.660
Didn't we just try that
and fail miserably?

05:27.744 --> 05:30.747
-Yeah, it's because his plan was stupid.
-Mm.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.540
-I got a better one.
-'Course you do.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.752
We go with the large
hard-on particle accelerator.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.629
You guys do some science, and…
[clicks tongue]

05:39.255 --> 05:41.174
…we launch the Kugelblitz
into outer space.

05:41.257 --> 05:43.051
[Diego] Didn't think I knew that, did ya?

05:44.260 --> 05:45.470
It's in Switzerland.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.221
It's "hadron,"

05:47.305 --> 05:49.057
not "hard-on,"

05:49.140 --> 05:50.224
ya moron!

05:50.308 --> 05:52.727
Oi! At least he's trying,
you shitty little squid.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.145
What have you contributed?

05:54.228 --> 05:55.813
Actually, he did blow up half his family.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.858
Oh, you wanna talk about family problems?

05:58.941 --> 06:02.070
You know what should have blown up
is your face on that neck!

06:02.153 --> 06:05.323
I wish I had a cake
to hit you with it in your face!

06:05.406 --> 06:06.699
[in Korean] What are you talking about?

06:06.783 --> 06:09.786
-[in Spanish] You better cut that out…
-[in Korean] Shut up!

06:09.869 --> 06:12.830
Hey! You guys done?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.291
The universe is disappearing outside.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.920
So you can keep
rearranging the deck chairs of the Titanic

06:19.003 --> 06:20.671
if it makes you feel better.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.217
But the fact remains that we are too late.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.718
[Diego and Ben scoff]

06:25.802 --> 06:26.886
Five, come on.

06:26.969 --> 06:29.222
It's over, Luther. We failed.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.099
Come on. It can't be over over.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.393
Yeah, come on, Five.
We gotta figure this out, man.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.812
Okay. How about we take a step back?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.647
Look at the big picture here.

06:37.730 --> 06:42.443
Most of us have spent the last 28 days
trying to stop the world from ending.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.863
What exactly have we accomplished?

06:51.744 --> 06:55.331
Well, we made some friends along the way.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.332
Incorrect!

06:56.416 --> 06:58.000
You know what we've done?

06:59.085 --> 07:01.754
Nothing. We made things worse
every single time.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.713
Amen to that.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.967
[sighs] Look, when I went
to the Commission,

07:06.050 --> 07:09.262
I had a conversation
with my 100-year-old self.

07:09.345 --> 07:13.182
And my last words were,
"Don't save the world."

07:13.266 --> 07:15.017
"Don't save the world"?

07:15.101 --> 07:16.853
"Don't save the world."

07:18.438 --> 07:20.356
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.734
Is it?
Well, whatever we're doing's not working.

07:23.818 --> 07:26.112
All we ever do
is save the world for a day,

07:26.195 --> 07:28.781
pat ourselves on the back,
and then everything goes to shit again.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.199
Yeah, maybe we're the problem.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.659
Oh, yeah. Us. [scoffs]

07:31.742 --> 07:33.077
[Lila] So, wait.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.745
Your big plan is

07:35.413 --> 07:36.581
no plan?

07:36.664 --> 07:39.250
Exactly. Conscientious objection.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.419
Why the hell not?
We've tried everything else.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.673
Look, maybe this is
just what the universe needs.

07:46.174 --> 07:49.635
I say, embrace the apocalypse.
See what's on the other side.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.346
What if it's… nothing?

07:53.681 --> 07:55.600
Then it's been nice knowing you all.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.939
Whatever's on your bucket list,
I recommend you do that now.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.358
[somber string music playing]

08:11.574 --> 08:15.328
Well, on that… super happy note,

08:16.162 --> 08:17.288
we've, um…

08:18.456 --> 08:19.874
-Oh, what the hell.
-[laughs] Okay.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.835
We've, uh, got
a little announcement to make.

08:24.879 --> 08:26.380
[both] We're engaged!

08:26.464 --> 08:28.216
[quietly] Kill me, Jesus.

08:28.299 --> 08:29.467
[dejected sigh]

08:29.550 --> 08:30.593
Idiots.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.136
Now?

08:32.220 --> 08:36.432
Yeah. Look, we realize
the timing is less than ideal.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.602
But, obviously, it's now or never.
Am I right, Five?

08:39.685 --> 08:41.646
Don't drag me into this, please.

08:41.729 --> 08:46.234
What… Whatever time we have left,
we wanna spend it with all of you.

08:46.817 --> 08:49.403
So we're super pumped

08:49.487 --> 08:52.198
if you would join us
in the banquet hall at 6:00 p.m.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.866
for a celebration of our love,

08:53.950 --> 08:56.285
and the official union

08:56.369 --> 08:58.287
of what's left of our two great families.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.791
Dress code is creative black-tie.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.252
[Sloane laughs]

09:05.461 --> 09:07.004
[thunder rumbling]

09:08.965 --> 09:10.424
Mr. Rodo.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.469
Sir Reginald, welcome back.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.263
-[Klaus gasps]
-It's been quite some time.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.931
You two know each other?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.641
Of course we do. I own this hotel.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.726
-Where are the children?
-They're upstairs, sir.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.271
-Very good. Ready my suite, Mr. Rodo.
-Right away, sir.

09:23.354 --> 09:25.940
-Come on then, my boy.
-Did you just say you owned this hotel?

09:26.023 --> 09:28.859
No time to discuss the finer points
of real estate investment just now.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.320
-We must strike while the iron is hot.
-Stick a pin in it.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.448
But, Daddy-o, we can't go in there
all guns a-blazing.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.866
What are you talking about?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.827
I'm just saying. Try not to be overly…

09:38.494 --> 09:39.453
[exhales]

09:39.537 --> 09:40.788
…you, 'kay?

09:42.415 --> 09:44.667
Just follow my lead, Klaus.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.298
Wow!

09:50.381 --> 09:51.382
[laughs]

09:51.465 --> 09:54.010
And you did all of this yourself?

09:54.093 --> 09:57.096
Luther helped too. We stayed up all night.

09:58.055 --> 09:59.473
[Lila] Amazing.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.810
-[Ben] Dad?
-Klaus.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.103
-Hey.
-[Viktor] Oh, thank God.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.896
Gather 'round, children. Quickly now!

10:05.980 --> 10:08.065
-The hell have you been?
-Oh, Reg and I.

10:08.149 --> 10:12.737
We got tangled up in a whole father-son
end-of-the-world road trip kinda thing.

10:12.820 --> 10:14.572
-You know?
-You two are hanging now?

10:14.655 --> 10:17.700
Yeah, we laughed,
we cried, we played in traffic,

10:17.783 --> 10:21.120
and long story short, I'm immortal now.

10:21.203 --> 10:23.372
[grunting dramatically]

10:23.456 --> 10:25.082
Whoa, wait. You're what now?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.501
Klaus, have you gotten
into the bath salts again?

10:27.585 --> 10:31.047
I think the more pertinent question is,
why are you all playing with jars?

10:31.130 --> 10:33.049
-[Sloane] They're invitations.
-[jar clatters]

10:33.132 --> 10:34.216
Nobody's playing.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.968
Luther and I are getting married.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.473
All of space and time is collapsing,
and you lot are planning a wedding?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.225
Yeah, and, uh, the thing is, um,

10:43.309 --> 10:45.102
space is limited.

10:45.186 --> 10:48.939
So it's kind of a per-plate situation,
so, you know.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.109
Is this how I raised you?
To fiddle while Rome burns?

10:52.193 --> 10:53.986
Remember what we talked about, Reg.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.030
-Remember to breathe.
-Quiet, I'm on a roll.

10:56.113 --> 10:59.617
-Dad, have you been taking your pills?
-As a matter of fact, I haven't.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.328
And I can confirm
that I've never felt better in my life.

11:02.411 --> 11:05.081
You thought you could dope me up
and slow me down,

11:05.164 --> 11:08.125
take control of my affairs
and squander my fortune.

11:08.209 --> 11:13.631
Well, Klaus here was good enough
to wean me off that wretched poison.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.257
And now that the fog is lifting,

11:15.341 --> 11:19.303
I can see all your dastardly designs
with a bracing clarity.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.181
You took him off his meds?
What were you thinking?

11:22.264 --> 11:23.891
He's the only one doing any thinking.

11:23.974 --> 11:28.229
All of you could learn a thing or two
from this impressive young man.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.731
[snickers]

11:30.815 --> 11:32.775
The world really is ending! Oh my God.

11:32.858 --> 11:36.153
As for the rest of you,
your training is to resume post-haste.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.572
We're running out of time.
We have a mission to complete.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.241
I'm ready. Let's do this.

11:40.324 --> 11:41.534
[Five] Let me guess.

11:41.617 --> 11:43.411
Project Oblivion?

11:43.494 --> 11:45.162
How do you know about that?

11:45.246 --> 11:46.956
I heard all about it from Pogo.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.376
Now, there's a name
I haven't heard in some time.

11:50.459 --> 11:53.713
And he confirmed
what I've always suspected about you.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.630
Which is?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.507
That you're a sadistic lunatic

11:56.590 --> 11:59.135
who's planning on gambling
all of our lives

11:59.218 --> 12:00.803
in another pointless mission.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.097
And you'd take the word
of a disgruntled chimp

12:03.180 --> 12:04.807
over that of your own father?

12:04.890 --> 12:06.767
Every damn day.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.271
Nobody wants you here, Dad.

12:11.689 --> 12:12.648
You should leave.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.109
Hey, you don't speak
for all of us, big guy.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.652
Feel free to join him.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.197
I see. So this is what it's come to.

12:21.323 --> 12:22.742
-Insurrection.
-[shushes]

12:22.825 --> 12:26.162
That's not the kind of erection
we're driving for here, all right?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.663
Everybody just needs to be cool.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.624
Clearly, you guys are on
a different chakra frequency right now.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.961
Hey, Pops, let's go have
a nice cup of tea in the suite.

12:34.044 --> 12:35.755
-Let go of my arm.
-Luther, Sloane.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.548
Oh my God. I'm beyond thrilled.

12:37.631 --> 12:40.718
You guys are gorgeous.
Amazing. Send me your registry!

12:57.777 --> 12:58.819
[Luther] Hey, Viktor.

12:58.903 --> 13:00.905
Um, I got a question.

13:00.988 --> 13:03.407
Well, really, it's more of a request, um…

13:03.491 --> 13:06.660
It's totally last minute, and…
The whole thing is last minute, but I--

13:06.744 --> 13:07.703
What is it?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.081
Will you be my best man?

13:12.458 --> 13:13.667
You don't have to do much.

13:13.751 --> 13:17.004
You just have to stand next to me
and make sure I don't act like an idiot.

13:17.087 --> 13:18.172
You know. [chuckles]

13:19.757 --> 13:20.841
I would love to.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.637
Okay. [chuckles] Great.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.389
Um, okay, so we're on a tight schedule.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.935
The bachelor party is in 15 minutes,
and not everyone is invited--

13:31.018 --> 13:32.186
-[Ben] What was that?
-So--

13:38.234 --> 13:39.527
Nothing, man. [chuckles]

13:39.610 --> 13:40.778
Nothing.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.158
Okay. [chuckles]

13:52.414 --> 13:53.415
[Viktor sighs]

13:57.586 --> 13:59.922
-[Lila] Are you still playing hard to get?
