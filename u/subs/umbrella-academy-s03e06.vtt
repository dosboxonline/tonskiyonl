I don't know, but that used to be
a portrait of a woman.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.776
These used to be Corn Nuts.

15:03.819 --> 15:05.279
[hinge squeaking]

15:06.822 --> 15:08.741
[eerie instrumental music playing]

15:08.824 --> 15:12.161
I don't normally say this,
but, uh, I'm officially freaked out.

15:14.371 --> 15:16.916
[man on radio]
Uh, I'd like to talk about ghosts…

15:16.999 --> 15:18.667
[radio static hisses]

15:18.751 --> 15:20.252
[blues song playing]

15:20.336 --> 15:21.503
How do we start?

15:22.087 --> 15:22.922
I don't know.

15:23.005 --> 15:26.800
Maybe start with what you did in the barn

15:26.884 --> 15:28.886
back in 1963.

15:29.720 --> 15:30.638
But that didn't work.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.765
I'm not a kid anymore. I can help you.

15:32.848 --> 15:33.766
Okay, how?

15:35.392 --> 15:36.560
Let me show you.

15:38.687 --> 15:41.106
[energy resonating]

15:48.072 --> 15:49.657
[wind howling]

15:50.532 --> 15:51.450
Can you hear it?

15:51.533 --> 15:52.618
[energy subsides]

15:52.701 --> 15:54.244
-I hear the wind.
-[Harlan] No.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.454
Deeper than that.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.958
Beneath the wind.
Every living thing has an energy wave.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.292
A sound of its own.

16:02.378 --> 16:05.589
[energy resonating]

16:05.673 --> 16:07.132
I… I…

16:07.216 --> 16:08.384
No, I… I can't.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.970
Concentrate. I want you to hear it.

16:12.638 --> 16:15.474
[energy resonating]

16:19.436 --> 16:20.813
[groans]

16:21.939 --> 16:23.190
It… It's hurting!

16:25.651 --> 16:27.861
[Harlan] You need to relax. Let it in.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.450
[groans]

16:35.035 --> 16:35.995
Viktor?

16:36.870 --> 16:39.081
-Viktor?
-[Viktor gasping]

16:40.874 --> 16:41.959
[Allison] Harlan, stop!

16:42.042 --> 16:43.085
I can take it.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.339
-[Viktor groans]
-[Allison] Harlan, that's enough!

16:47.423 --> 16:51.051
[echoing] I heard a rumor you let him go.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.220
Listen harder, Viktor! You have to listen!

16:53.804 --> 16:56.598
[groaning]

16:57.933 --> 16:59.935
[straining] I can… hear… it.

17:00.519 --> 17:01.895
[Viktor groaning]

17:01.979 --> 17:05.149
Focus on it.
Let it flow through your body.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.697
[screaming]

17:11.780 --> 17:12.948
[feedback whines]

17:13.032 --> 17:14.033
[groaning]

17:16.452 --> 17:17.327
[groans]

17:17.411 --> 17:19.038
[panting]

17:19.121 --> 17:20.164
[Allison] Harlan!

17:21.165 --> 17:24.293
Harlan, stop! It's too much!
[voice echoes]

17:28.630 --> 17:31.258
[Allison panting]

17:31.842 --> 17:33.802
How the hell did I just do that?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.722
You had no right! We were making progress.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.516
Progress? You were killing him!

17:39.600 --> 17:41.268
[Viktor panting]

17:41.351 --> 17:44.772
You said we could try till tonight.
There's still time. You promised.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.987
No. No, there's something else
going on here.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.531
You wouldn't be
risking your life like this.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.076
Look, whatever it is, you can tell me.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.328
[panting]

18:03.248 --> 18:04.541
You don't have to be here.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.045
[emotional string music playing]

18:10.881 --> 18:12.591
Well, I don't have anywhere else to go.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.184
But I'm not gonna stand here
and watch you try to kill yourself.

18:35.906 --> 18:36.949
Okay.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.078
I'm ready.

18:56.301 --> 18:59.346
-How much longer do we have to wait?
-Are you in a rush to be somewhere else?

18:59.429 --> 19:02.307
No, it's just…
I'm not supposed to be here.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.977
For all I know, Ben and Fei
can jump up from behind that couch

19:05.060 --> 19:06.603
and stab me to death.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.022
I'd never let them lay a finger on you.

19:10.065 --> 19:11.066
Okay.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.237
Give us a minute.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.076
You. Be nice.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.163
[footsteps fade]

19:28.292 --> 19:31.086
Listen, I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to creep into your house.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.963
-Don't blame Sloane--
-What's your game?

19:33.046 --> 19:34.590
Big fan of Yahtzee.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.802
You know, old Ben
would have laughed at that joke.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.096
Okay, Gigantor,

19:41.930 --> 19:42.931
out with it.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.185
What's with your family's
weird brother Ben fetish?

19:46.768 --> 19:49.021
He… you…

19:50.272 --> 19:51.648
were the best of us,

19:52.816 --> 19:54.484
and you died too soon.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.779
[sighs] The Jennifer incident--

19:57.863 --> 19:58.947
The what?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.407
It doesn't matter.

20:00.490 --> 20:04.203
Just know that we were
never the same without you.

20:05.996 --> 20:10.792
So, I'll take every second
of whatever version of you we've got.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.920
I'm not him, you moron.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.421
Yes, I know.

20:16.215 --> 20:21.094
He cared about people.
He was selfless and… and kind--

20:21.178 --> 20:22.137
Don't forget funny.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.348
[chuckles]

20:25.724 --> 20:26.850
You know, maybe…

20:28.560 --> 20:30.646
maybe there's a little bit of him
inside of you.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.397
Nope. Not at all.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.026
Well, genetically you are the same person,
just raised in a different environment.

20:36.109 --> 20:38.654
Oh, here we go.

20:38.737 --> 20:41.949
The old nature versus nurture argument.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.079
Deny it,

20:48.121 --> 20:49.665
but he's in there…

20:52.209 --> 20:53.335
somewhere.

20:54.920 --> 20:55.921
Okay.

20:57.422 --> 21:01.260
I've already had one big dumb brother
telling me what to do.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.761
I don't need another.

21:03.553 --> 21:05.055
But the team might.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.557
Grace!

21:14.147 --> 21:15.148
[Luther] Mom?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.361
-Are you all right?
-Of course. Why do you ask?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.071
Open it.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.335
-[raven caws]
-I can't take this.

21:35.419 --> 21:36.420
Oh my God.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.171
Are you serious?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.132
I'd rather have him with us

21:40.966 --> 21:42.259
than against us.

21:42.926 --> 21:46.305
Aren't you gonna try it on?
You're about Marcus's size.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.140
Hey. What's wrong?

21:48.724 --> 21:49.725
I'm honored.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.894
Really, I am. I just…

21:55.272 --> 21:56.523
I'm still an Umbrella.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.774
Are you?

21:59.776 --> 22:01.695
You can stay as long as you like.

22:07.451 --> 22:09.077
What the hell was that?

22:10.912 --> 22:12.706
Wouldn't you like to know.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.901
[engine stops]

22:46.281 --> 22:47.657
[woman] Can I help you?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.911
Need a word with Pogo.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.662
Ain't no Pogo here, pumpkin.

22:53.789 --> 22:54.664
Okay.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.962
So I suggest you get
your ass off my property

23:01.046 --> 23:02.923
before I call a truant officer.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.056
[Pogo] It's okay, Tammy. Let the boy in.

23:26.822 --> 23:27.864
[pistol cocking]

23:31.243 --> 23:33.161
You're either dumb or desperate.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.914
-Which is it?
-You tell me.

23:36.957 --> 23:37.999
[sniffs]

23:40.001 --> 23:42.879
That looks like my work,
but I never did that tattoo.

23:42.963 --> 23:44.548
Not yet, you haven't.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.716
I cut it off my 100-year-old self.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.635
Ah, so desperate it is.

23:48.718 --> 23:52.055
You would be too if you knew
the entire universe were at stake.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.599
[sharp inhale] So it's happened.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.435
[pistol de-cocks]

23:58.019 --> 23:58.979
Hmm.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.234
Ah, here it is.

24:04.317 --> 24:05.444
Look familiar?

24:10.365 --> 24:12.868
Reggie was obsessed with these symbols.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.202
It's a sigil.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.830
A symbol thought to have magical powers.

24:16.913 --> 24:19.374
Dad believed in science, facts.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.795
I didn't respect much about the old man,
but I respected that.

24:23.879 --> 24:25.589
Hoo-ha was not his thing.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.508
It's gotta have a rational meaning.

24:29.092 --> 24:32.345
I don't know,
but he referred to it as Project Oblivion.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.766
Oblivion.

24:37.934 --> 24:40.645
This project. I need to know more.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.815
4-Adam-30 requesting SWAT and a backup.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.150
[Reginald] You got this, T. J. !

24:45.233 --> 24:47.486
3455 California Street.

24:47.569 --> 24:48.403
[glass shatters]

24:48.487 --> 24:51.448
I'm under fire from a single assailant
with an automatic weapon.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.450
There's a female hostage.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.121
[Reginald] You again!

24:58.997 --> 25:00.832
To what do I owe the intrusion?

25:01.333 --> 25:04.503
Well, you know, with the world ending
for the thrice time,

25:04.586 --> 25:07.631
I thought, why not finally get to know
my old man?

25:07.714 --> 25:09.299
I'm not your old man, young man.

25:09.382 --> 25:12.219
I may look like him, act like him,
but I did not raise you.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.304
Yeah, yeah, different timeline,
I get all that stuff.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.514
But you're still him though!

25:15.597 --> 25:16.932
You look like him,

25:17.015 --> 25:19.726
and you act like him, only--

25:19.809 --> 25:20.936
Only what?

25:21.019 --> 25:23.813
You're so much nicer than the other one.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.024
He was a complete asshole!

25:26.107 --> 25:28.401
Such opprobrious language for your father!

25:28.485 --> 25:31.071
Yeah, I… I don't know what that means.

25:31.154 --> 25:34.282
I'd love to stay here idly chatting,
but I'm terribly busy.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.867
Yeah, well, too bad!

25:35.951 --> 25:37.577
'Cause everything's
leading me back to you,

25:37.661 --> 25:40.080
back to here,
the… the White Buffalo Suite.

25:40.163 --> 25:42.499
The menudo that resembled the painting.

25:42.582 --> 25:45.627
-You know about the White Buffalo Suite.
-That's where I died!

25:45.710 --> 25:46.711
[makes croaking noise]

25:47.837 --> 25:49.130
What is it you want from me?

25:49.214 --> 25:50.131
I…

25:50.715 --> 25:53.885
Have you ever felt like there's something
you're supposed to be doing,

25:53.969 --> 25:57.639
something important,
but no one's telling you what it is,

25:57.722 --> 25:59.266
and you're scared

25:59.349 --> 26:01.893
that you're gonna miss out
or… or… or mess it up

26:01.977 --> 26:06.273
because you're always screwin' things up,
and you're really fuckin' tired of it!

26:06.356 --> 26:07.899
Good, go on.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.861
I need you to help me understand
certain things about who I am.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.071
Such as?

26:13.154 --> 26:17.742
Like why you locked me in a mausoleum

26:17.826 --> 26:19.995
and slowed down my heart rate

26:20.912 --> 26:22.622
until I came to

26:23.456 --> 26:25.625
in a pool of my own vomit.

26:25.709 --> 26:26.710
Now, that's just--

26:26.793 --> 26:29.963
that's what the little girl
on the bicycle showed me,

26:30.046 --> 26:31.631
but she might be God.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.966
She might be the devil.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.760
I mean, I don't know. Who's to say?
I don't know which is which.

26:35.844 --> 26:38.138
You are marvelously deranged.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.349
Sit.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.810
Sit. Come, tell me everything!

26:43.893 --> 26:44.853
[Klaus] Okay.

26:48.898 --> 26:49.858
[bell dings]

26:49.941 --> 26:52.902
[traditional Japanese flute music playing]

26:56.740 --> 26:57.741
[Diego] Stan!

27:00.160 --> 27:01.244
[Diego] Stanley!

27:05.373 --> 27:06.875
This place is jacked.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.752
Really? I hadn't noticed.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.670
[Lila] Come on.

27:11.504 --> 27:13.214
Hello!

27:14.883 --> 27:16.009
"Hotel Oblivion."

27:17.344 --> 27:20.263
Whoa, numpty! Can't you read?
It says "do not ring bell."

27:20.347 --> 27:23.850
We need help finding Stan. Why put a bell
if they don't want us to ring it?

27:23.933 --> 27:25.935
-[Lila] Trudy's gonna kill me.
-Who's Trudy?

27:26.019 --> 27:26.936
Stan's mum.

27:27.020 --> 27:28.271
[Diego] Wait.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.025
What?

27:35.612 --> 27:38.323
Stan, he's not our child.
Fancy some sushi?

27:42.577 --> 27:46.581
I mean, it was kind of like a dream.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.999
[pencil scratching]

27:48.083 --> 27:50.794
But then it was also
like a perfume commercial.

27:52.712 --> 27:55.423
[sighs] And then there was soup.

27:55.965 --> 27:58.343
And then when I was finished,

27:59.344 --> 28:00.845
I just came back.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.806
Just… pow!

28:03.890 --> 28:05.392
[Klaus] I said I'd come back.

28:06.059 --> 28:09.729
-Are you even listening to me?
-I'm hanging on every word.

28:09.813 --> 28:11.564
This is fascinating.

28:11.648 --> 28:13.817
Everything is fascinating

28:13.900 --> 28:16.486
ever since you weaned me off
those damned pills.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.656
I'd like to return the favor.

28:19.739 --> 28:22.701
Help you to understand who you really are.
Would you like that?

28:22.784 --> 28:26.121
There's nothing I'd like more.

28:26.621 --> 28:29.874
Other than a probiotic yogurt
that doesn't make me fart.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.459
Then get over here, boy!

28:32.168 --> 28:33.545
[Klaus giggles] Okay.

28:38.466 --> 28:39.676
[Klaus grunts]

28:39.759 --> 28:43.930
A little stiffer than I expected,
but we gotta start somewhere, I suppose.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.641
-What are you doing back there?
-Part one of your healing.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.601
Experimentation.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.648
-[electricity crackling]
-[groaning]

28:53.732 --> 28:54.941
[grunts]

28:55.442 --> 28:56.568
[electricity humming]

28:56.651 --> 28:57.861
Fascinating!

29:00.989 --> 29:03.074
It was a kamikaze mission.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.244
He was preparing the Sparrow children
with the expectation

29:06.327 --> 29:07.787
they might never return.

29:08.371 --> 29:10.707
That's why I gave
the children those pills,

29:10.790 --> 29:12.250
to keep them safe from him.

29:12.333 --> 29:15.795
Well, my druggie brother
just got him sober. Go figure.

29:16.671 --> 29:21.217
Then Project Oblivion is starting again,
and you are all in danger.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.769
Then I should probably get that ink.
Complete the loop.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.604
Are you sure?

29:33.646 --> 29:36.232
Oh, I don't think destiny cares
whether I am or not.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.984
Bitch is cruel, ain't she?

29:46.034 --> 29:48.703
[Pogo] Well then, let's get started.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.790
[tattoo machine buzzing]

29:57.003 --> 29:59.589
[Harlan] You're still using
the sounds that you can hear,

30:01.174 --> 30:02.217
like the rain

30:03.384 --> 30:06.137
or the wind
or the sound of your own breathing.

30:06.721 --> 30:09.682
You have to learn
to use the sounds that you can't.

30:09.766 --> 30:11.392
Yeah, how am I supposed to do that?

30:11.476 --> 30:15.355
When you left,
I realized I had this… thing inside me.

30:15.438 --> 30:16.356
This

30:17.649 --> 30:18.608
power.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.402
I hoped I could use it for something good.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.487
Something

30:23.655 --> 30:24.489
beautiful.

30:25.281 --> 30:26.991
I didn't know what it was.

30:29.202 --> 30:30.703
I… I called it marigold.

30:30.787 --> 30:31.830
Like the flower?

30:34.332 --> 30:36.584
You know how bees find pollen?

30:38.336 --> 30:41.464
Bees have a positive charge,
flowers have a negative one.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.843
The bees use the hairs on their body

30:44.926 --> 30:47.554
to detect the interaction
between the fields.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.765
They can hear the pollen.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.934
Okay. What-- [scoffs] What are you saying?

30:53.017 --> 30:54.561
[dramatic instrumental music playing]

30:54.644 --> 30:56.354
You need to stop listening

30:58.022 --> 30:59.274
with your ears.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.492
Listen with your marigold.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.498
And find mine.

31:15.582 --> 31:18.251
[Viktor inhales]

31:18.334 --> 31:19.544
[Viktor exhales sharply]

31:23.673 --> 31:26.593
[energy resonates]

31:26.676 --> 31:28.970
[distant thunder rumbling]

31:38.229 --> 31:40.565
[Ray] I always thought
you hated playgrounds.

31:41.316 --> 31:45.737
Every time we passed by one,
you always just looked the other way.

31:48.698 --> 31:51.409
[emotional instrumental music playing]

31:51.492 --> 31:55.705
Our father never let us play on them
because he said they were juvenile.

31:58.041 --> 31:59.167
Claire loved them.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.835
Especially the swings.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.797
I wish you could have met her.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.093
I'm sure we probably would have
gotten along just fine.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.553
[Allison chuckles]

32:10.637 --> 32:12.764
More than fine. She would have loved you.

32:13.640 --> 32:15.350
The way that I loved you.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.310
The way I still love you.

32:17.393 --> 32:21.189
I love you too, baby.
And you know I'm always gon' love you.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.440
Please stop.

32:22.523 --> 32:23.441
Why?

32:23.524 --> 32:24.943
Because you're not real.

32:27.987 --> 32:31.115
The Ray I know died nine years ago
at the age of 82. I looked it up.

32:31.199 --> 32:33.076
Well, I hope I had a good life.

32:33.701 --> 32:35.495
Not as good as you deserved.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.832
[Ray] So, what?

32:40.541 --> 32:41.668
You seeing things?

32:41.751 --> 32:43.628
I think I'm losing my mind.

32:43.711 --> 32:46.214
We all go a little crazy
from time to time.

32:46.839 --> 32:48.466
Maybe that's what
stress'll do to a person.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.259
You don't understand.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.599
I can't get back to you or Claire.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.645
You're both gone forever,
and it's like you were never real.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.188
Were you ever real?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.400
We were here. You know it.

33:06.109 --> 33:07.777
And as long as you're alive,

33:07.860 --> 33:10.613
we're gon' keep on living in there

33:10.697 --> 33:11.948
and in here.

33:13.366 --> 33:17.495
No matter when or where you are,
we're both always gon' be with you,

33:17.578 --> 33:20.206
so you have got to do
what it takes to survive this.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.168
Promise me.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.134
[inhales sharply]

33:31.217 --> 33:33.011
-[thunder rumbles]
-[sighs]

33:36.055 --> 33:39.142
[energy resonates faintly]

33:46.941 --> 33:49.193
[energy pulsing]

33:50.570 --> 33:52.363
[electricity crackling]

33:52.947 --> 33:54.073
Oh God.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.158
Viktor.

33:55.241 --> 33:58.161
[thunder clapping]

34:05.418 --> 34:07.128
[Allison] Viktor!

34:11.841 --> 34:13.301
Viktor!

34:18.431 --> 34:21.100
[Viktor groaning]

34:22.643 --> 34:24.979
[car alarm blaring]

34:26.147 --> 34:27.273
[energy zapping]

34:30.318 --> 34:31.569
[Allison] Viktor!

34:36.824 --> 34:40.036
[energy resonating loudly]

34:40.119 --> 34:42.955
[Viktor groaning]

34:46.626 --> 34:48.586
[both groaning]

34:48.669 --> 34:50.963

35:17.073 --> 35:18.157

35:18.241 --> 35:22.036
[panting]

35:26.040 --> 35:27.041
[gasps]

35:31.337 --> 35:32.380
Viktor.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.674
Hey.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.926
-Hey. Hey.
-[Viktor groaning]

35:37.009 --> 35:38.719
Hey. Come on, come on, come on.

35:38.803 --> 35:39.762
[Viktor grunting]

35:39.846 --> 35:41.430
[Allison] Hey, hey. You okay?

35:42.056 --> 35:43.474
[Allison panting]

35:43.558 --> 35:44.559
Hey.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.061
[Viktor] Harlan?

35:50.106 --> 35:51.315
It's gone.

35:52.108 --> 35:52.984
[chuckles softly]

35:53.067 --> 35:54.527
[Harlan] We did it.

35:54.610 --> 35:55.695
[Allison] Okay. He's okay.

35:55.778 --> 35:58.447
Okay? Hey. Hey. He's okay.

36:03.703 --> 36:05.746
[gentle flute music playing]

36:06.497 --> 36:10.001
[Diego] So, Stan… is adopted. Okay.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.627
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.713
I was adopted. I turned out pretty well.

36:13.796 --> 36:17.049
No, not adopted. I borrowed him
from my mate Trudy for a week.

36:17.133 --> 36:20.219
Wait, hold up. You bo--
Lila, did you kidnap a kid?

36:20.303 --> 36:22.305
She went on holiday,
and he needed some fun,

36:22.388 --> 36:24.515
and I wanted to see
what kind of dad you'd make.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.475
You know, stress test. Kick the tires.

36:26.559 --> 36:27.977
Are you insane?!

36:28.060 --> 36:29.770
Uh, we met in an asylum.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.522
Unbel--

36:32.481 --> 36:34.942
You know, Stan deserves better than this.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.235
Stanley's in on it!

36:36.319 --> 36:37.445
Oh Jesus.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.740
Oh, you… You're… You're…

36:41.449 --> 36:43.534
You're… You're… You're…!

36:45.203 --> 36:46.370
[yells]

36:47.872 --> 36:50.291
-Damn it!
-It's okay, love. It'll come to you.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.001
You know what? I will deal with you later.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.837
Right now, we lost a kid.

36:54.921 --> 36:57.632
A human being
that belongs to somebody else.

36:57.715 --> 37:00.301
Why do you think I'm stress eating
dead bloody fish, you wanker?

37:00.384 --> 37:03.888
Look, I adore that little criminal, okay?
More than you ever will.

37:03.971 --> 37:05.640
But Stanley can take care of himself.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.767
He's probably having a laugh.
We just need to--

37:07.850 --> 37:09.644
Forget it. I'll deal with this myself.

37:10.144 --> 37:13.648
We should probably stay in one place.
What if he wanders by?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.162
How's Viktor?

37:28.246 --> 37:29.538
Sleeping.

37:30.706 --> 37:31.874
He's exhausted.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.796
Thank you for before,
letting us finish what we needed to do.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.589
He's my brother.

37:39.465 --> 37:40.758
I'd do anything for him.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.637
What happens to me now?

37:44.720 --> 37:46.222
You go home.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.349
We clean up your mess.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.809
With the Sparrows.

37:50.726 --> 37:51.811
Yeah.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.780
It's okay. I know why you don't like me.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.037
-I don't like the hold you have on him.
-It's because of what I did.

38:10.538 --> 38:11.539
To all of you.

38:12.999 --> 38:14.333
And what is that exactly?

38:15.668 --> 38:18.212
[ominous instrumental music playing]

38:18.296 --> 38:19.422
I…

38:20.589 --> 38:22.758
I… thought Viktor told you.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.220
About the mothers.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.349
It was you.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.936
-You're the reason they're all dead.
-It was an accident.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.814
-I didn't mean to hurt them.
-You're the reason Claire's dead.

38:36.897 --> 38:40.276
-My powers spilled over. Got in my head.
-And the reason the whole world is ending!

38:40.359 --> 38:42.320
I… I couldn't stop myself.

38:42.403 --> 38:43.612
Viktor knew.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.657
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.409
I didn't want--

38:48.492 --> 38:50.870
Sorry is what you say
when you spill a glass of milk,

38:50.953 --> 38:53.039
not obliterate somebody's child!

38:57.376 --> 38:58.586
What are you gonna do?

38:58.669 --> 39:01.297
[foreboding music swells]

39:05.676 --> 39:06.677
Stan!

39:22.109 --> 39:23.361
Lila! Get over here.

39:23.444 --> 39:24.612
Did you find him?

39:26.614 --> 39:29.075
[Diego] I can't… I can't get out.
The doors won't let me.

39:29.158 --> 39:31.410
Yeah, I am never eating here again.

39:32.078 --> 39:33.954
You have the attention span
of a fruit fly.

39:35.331 --> 39:38.125
-Where are you going?
-To get help finding Stan.

39:38.667 --> 39:41.128

hey, hey, hey! No!
