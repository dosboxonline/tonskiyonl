I know Harlan killed all of our mothers.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.394
-[Diego] What?
-Whoa.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.938
-[Five] What?
-Shit.

13:34.772 --> 13:35.606
[Diego sighs]

13:35.689 --> 13:37.358
Bloody plot twist.

13:39.193 --> 13:40.402
Who told you that?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.403
[Allison] Harlan.

13:41.487 --> 13:45.366
After you lied about it to my face.

13:45.950 --> 13:48.744
Is that true, Viktor?
Harlan started all this?

13:50.037 --> 13:52.873
Yeah, but he didn't mean
to hurt anyone. He--

13:52.957 --> 13:54.083
How do you know?

13:55.584 --> 13:57.211
[Viktor] Because I knew him.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.923
And he was sweet
and kind until I made him like us.

14:01.006 --> 14:03.050
Okay? So, I screwed him up.

14:03.133 --> 14:06.387
And if you need someone to blame,
I'm right here--

14:06.470 --> 14:08.013
What makes you think I don't?

14:10.140 --> 14:12.226
This wasn't about saving the world.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.106
This was about hurting me.

14:19.108 --> 14:20.317
Payback for--

14:21.735 --> 14:22.862
Go on.

14:25.656 --> 14:26.490
Say her name.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.993
You know what? Maybe we should all just
take a minute-- Okay.

14:29.076 --> 14:32.079
-Did killing Harlan bring Claire back?
-Did protecting him bring Sissy back?

14:32.162 --> 14:34.415
-It was just as personal for you--
-I didn't kill anyone!

14:34.498 --> 14:38.794
But you risked everyone!
Do you know what that felt like?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.006
Watching you fight harder to protect
the man who helped destroy my daughter

14:42.089 --> 14:43.632
than you ever did to bring her back?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.634
I don't know how to bring Claire back.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.596
Okay? No one does.
But I was there for you.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.723
-I tried. I was--
-[Allison] To what?

14:50.806 --> 14:51.891
Help me grieve?

14:52.600 --> 14:55.769
God, this whole family is so quick
to tell me to suck up my pain

14:55.853 --> 14:57.813
and so worried about fixing yours!

14:58.397 --> 14:59.815
Somebody had to pay

14:59.899 --> 15:01.650
because you never seem to.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.904
Destroy the world,
kill Pogo, almost kill me,

15:04.987 --> 15:05.821
and for what?

15:05.905 --> 15:08.407
So we can all run around
and clean up your mess?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.533
I'm sick of it.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.993
Take it easy, Allison.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.369
[shushing]

15:13.120 --> 15:14.914
-Okay, I--
-Shut your mouth! [voice echoes]

15:14.997 --> 15:15.998
Allison.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.625
[Viktor choking]

15:17.708 --> 15:21.837
Every time I build a new life for myself,

15:21.921 --> 15:25.758
you end the world and take it from me!

15:25.841 --> 15:28.093
How are you doing this
without saying, "I heard a rumor"?

15:28.177 --> 15:30.971
Just a little residual gift from Harlan.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.265
All right, that's it.
Knock off the power shit, Allison.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.809
-It's not okay!
-[coughing, gasping for air]

15:35.893 --> 15:39.146
[coughing]

15:40.689 --> 15:43.484
We should have left you in the basement.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.860
Whoa! Allison, all right!

15:45.653 --> 15:47.863
-[Luther gasps]
-[Viktor coughs]

15:47.947 --> 15:49.365
[sharp exhale]

15:55.621 --> 15:56.455
[Five] You okay?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.415
I'm fine.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.793
[departing footsteps]

16:00.876 --> 16:01.919
Let's continue.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.253
[Ben] Sweet.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.172
You guys fight just like us.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.633
Nah, man.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.928
We don't fight like this.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.435
[somber string music playing]

16:27.653 --> 16:30.572
[panting]

16:51.260 --> 16:56.849
[somber music swelling]

17:22.791 --> 17:24.835
[Reginald] So tell me.
What do we like to do together?

17:24.918 --> 17:26.086
For fun.

17:27.379 --> 17:29.006
I don't understand the question.

17:29.089 --> 17:31.300
Didn't we take any family trips
in your timeline?

17:31.383 --> 17:32.384
With our dad?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.844
Hell no.

17:33.927 --> 17:36.180
That guy put the "dick" in dictator.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.766
No, no. It was all about
the missions with him.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.892
Just mission after mission…

17:39.975 --> 17:42.519
How is it you don't understand
the first thing about your powers?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.188
Did you learn nothing at the Academy?

17:44.271 --> 17:48.025
Well, things kinda went sideways
at the ol' Academy early on.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.151
How so?

17:50.360 --> 17:52.362
Five got lost in time.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.615
Just… gone.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.618
Ben died during the Jennifer incident.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.204
-Tragic.
-Oh, tragic? I'm not finished.

18:00.287 --> 18:02.748
You drugged your daughter. For years.

18:02.831 --> 18:07.461
You turned Luther
into a half-monkey moonboy freak thing.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.714
You locked me in a box full of ghosts.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.966
And then you killed yourself

18:13.050 --> 18:15.677
so that none of us
would ever get any answers.

18:15.761 --> 18:16.595
I see.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.932
What I'm saying is,
you were a terrible father.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.476
-Yes. Picked that up. Thank you.
-Good.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.853
-High time I made it up to you.
-[laughs]

18:24.937 --> 18:26.814
-Starting now.
-[chuckles]

18:26.897 --> 18:30.442
You just murdered me
and stuffed me in the trunk of your car.

18:30.526 --> 18:33.529
-I have notes, Dad.
-Let's not quibble over details.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.530
A new proposal.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.240
I help you master your powers,

18:36.323 --> 18:38.867
you stop blaming me
for the sins of your other father.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.744
Allow us a new start.

18:42.830 --> 18:47.126
All right, but I told you,
I can't control how long I'm dead.

18:47.209 --> 18:49.461
It's just one of those
mystery-of-life things.

18:49.545 --> 18:50.379
Nonsense.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.965
-Dying well is a skill like any other.
-I'm telling you…

18:53.048 --> 18:55.884
You simply need the right coach.
Do you trust me?

18:58.804 --> 19:00.639
Yeah. I trust you.

19:00.722 --> 19:01.974
[chuckles]

19:07.980 --> 19:10.232
[Reginald] Near-immortality
is an unbelievable gift.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.693
Yet, you come back to life
at unpredictable intervals

19:12.776 --> 19:15.737
outside of your control,
with the reflexes of a wet noodle.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.282
Thoroughly unable to defend yourself
or your team.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.993
Somehow, you've turned an asset
into your liability.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.663
Yeah, well, not that I care
about your opinion,

19:24.746 --> 19:27.624
but if I were to improve myself,

19:28.667 --> 19:29.668
how would I do it?

19:29.751 --> 19:33.922
First, let's sharpen your reflexes.
Practice makes perfect.

19:34.006 --> 19:34.840
Stand there.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.718
When you're fast enough
to catch this ball,

19:37.801 --> 19:39.219
you will have succeeded.

19:41.054 --> 19:42.306
[Klaus] Why not? Okay.

19:42.389 --> 19:43.932
But just so you know,

19:44.016 --> 19:46.727
I have the hand-eye coordination
of a drunk kitten.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.354

See? Too slow!

20:25.057 --> 20:26.058
Again!

20:26.141 --> 20:29.019

Yeah, who I didn't know
and don't care about.

[Fei] Right. So it's all about you.

22:40.650 --> 22:41.943
[Five] All of us are irrelevant.

22:48.283 --> 22:50.952
-Why aren't we getting sucked inside?
-[Sloane] We don't know.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.163
You shouldn't exist here,
and neither should this.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.124

Or we could all die horribly.

-You're not the one we need.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.895
And there's nothing…

What… Whatever it is you came to say,

if Allison's still there.

24:18.331 --> 24:19.958
Just came to get my jacket.

24:21.543 --> 24:26.423
Have you been waiting for someone
to come chase after you this whole time?

24:27.299 --> 24:28.633
Wow! [chuckles]

24:29.134 --> 24:30.510
That's so embarrassing.

24:31.887 --> 24:34.264
Well, it's official. Our Ben was better.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.932
So I'm told.

24:36.933 --> 24:38.018
But didn't he die?

24:38.935 --> 24:42.939
You know, people say we have egos,
but you're the real messy bitches.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.692
Letting the world burn
because you're angry at your sister?

24:45.775 --> 24:46.735
Outstanding.

24:46.818 --> 24:49.154
-That's not what I'm doing.
-Don't care.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.530
Won't matter much longer anyway.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.658
In a few days,
we'll all be, uh, Kugel-toast.

24:54.367 --> 24:57.787

Here, your gift became your nightmare.

No, because that's weird.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.034
[Sloane] You can't just pick it up.

29:46.117 --> 29:49.037
You have to keep the nest calm

41:08.090 --> 41:11.093
Yeah. Five told me. How did you know?

41:11.177 --> 41:12.261
Infinite Switchboard.

41:14.346 --> 41:17.349
I missed your stupid face,
so I snuck in to get a glimpse of you.

41:17.433 --> 41:18.559
And instead…

41:22.646 --> 41:23.647
Thing is,

41:24.982 --> 41:28.569
I'm not gonna be very good
at this… mother thing.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.613

41:31.614 --> 41:34.366
But I saw you with Stan,
and you're a good dad.

What do you want from me, Lila?

41:42.917 --> 41:43.751
Okay.

41:44.502 --> 41:45.503

41:50.132 --> 41:52.051
I think you should run from me.

41:54.553 --> 41:55.638
I, um…

41:59.308 --> 42:01.018
I think I'm a bloody mess.

42:01.977 --> 42:06.524
And I think that someone who's…
who never had a family

42:06.607 --> 42:08.692
is in no position to ask for one.

42:10.694 --> 42:12.071
But that's what I want.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.574
With you.

42:52.653 --> 42:53.612
[Five] Okay.

Hey, that was really nice of you.

43:02.246 --> 43:05.499
My God. We are a weird family, aren't we?

43:06.834 --> 43:09.628
Sorry. Yeah, I heard it as I said it.

43:09.712 --> 43:10.546
It's all right.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.719
[Five exhales sharply]

43:19.096 --> 43:21.181
What are we gonna do about Allison?

43:22.224 --> 43:24.602
We're all worried about Allison, but

43:25.853 --> 43:27.146
I'm scared for you.

43:27.896 --> 43:28.856
Seriously?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.693
-Yeah.
-She killed someone.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.112
I was trying to do the right thing
and save Harlan's life.

43:35.195 --> 43:37.990
Do you know why I wanted this last jump
to work so badly?

43:38.073 --> 43:39.491
Because you're old and tired?

43:39.575 --> 43:41.744
Because I slaughtered
a boardroom full of people

43:41.827 --> 43:43.412
to buy our way back here.

43:46.165 --> 43:47.166
Shit.

43:50.669 --> 43:53.005
Little advice from someone
who's been there?

43:54.298 --> 43:55.674
Don't do the math.

43:56.842 --> 43:58.844
That equation does not exist.

43:59.595 --> 44:03.932
There's no "save five Harlans
for every two Claires" formula.

44:04.642 --> 44:07.144
People like us, we will never

44:08.270 --> 44:11.523
save enough lives
to make up for the ones that we take.

44:13.442 --> 44:14.735
I don't accept that.

44:14.818 --> 44:16.153
Then you'll drown.

44:16.654 --> 44:20.824
This is the price of being powerful.
Sometimes we step on ants.

44:22.785 --> 44:26.413
And the sooner you face that,
the safer we'll all be.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.290
What is that supposed to mean?

44:29.291 --> 44:32.586
It means you're very dangerous,
Viktor Hargreeves.

44:33.462 --> 44:36.507
The decisions you make
impact the entire world.

44:37.383 --> 44:40.719
So no matter how benevolent they may seem,

44:41.303 --> 44:43.263
you don't get to make them alone.

44:47.851 --> 44:50.813
You know what they call
a superhero who works alone

44:51.480 --> 44:53.107
and doesn't listen to anybody?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.026
A villain.

44:58.612 --> 44:59.905
I am not a villain, Five.

44:59.988 --> 45:02.658
And, Viktor,
I hope to God you never will be.

45:03.992 --> 45:05.703
But that remains to be seen.

45:06.954 --> 45:07.955

I'm always here for you.
