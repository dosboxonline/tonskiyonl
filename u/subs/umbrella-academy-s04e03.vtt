WEBVTT

00:11.678 --> 00:13.680
[kitschy synth music playing]

00:24.149 --> 00:25.400
Good evening, everyone.

00:25.483 --> 00:26.609
I'm Jessica Holmes.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.611
And I'm Dan Tenenbaum.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.364
We begin tonight
with a larger-than-life story

00:31.448 --> 00:32.991
down on Kensington Wharf.

00:33.074 --> 00:36.244
Action 9's very own Bailey Stone
is live with the story.

00:36.911 --> 00:38.705
That's right, Jessica.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.458
I'm here with two local crabbers

00:41.541 --> 00:42.709
who appear to have caught

00:42.792 --> 00:47.756
what may be the largest squid
ever recorded by man.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.801
Can you walk our viewers through
exactly what happened?

00:52.302 --> 00:53.261
Sure. Yeah.

00:53.344 --> 00:57.098
We was, uh, out there.
You know, a… a normal day.

00:57.182 --> 00:58.767
We was trying to haul in some claws

00:58.850 --> 01:02.604
when Rolfe here, he said
that he snagged something real big.

01:02.687 --> 01:03.688
Real big, yeah.

01:03.772 --> 01:05.356
Yeah, huge like.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.692
Yeah, I thought it was a fucking whale.

01:07.776 --> 01:09.944
So I says, "Go on! Reel 'er in!"

01:10.028 --> 01:13.323
Yeah, and I'm reeling 'er in, right,
and I'm reeling and reeling.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.992
Right. And then,
next thing you know, bang!

01:16.076 --> 01:18.369
-Yeah.
-Look at that. A big-ass squid.

01:18.453 --> 01:19.621
Real big. Yeah.

01:19.704 --> 01:24.918
What was going through your mind
when you saw that?

01:25.001 --> 01:27.754
Uh, great question.
I was actually… I was hungry.

01:27.837 --> 01:31.007
-On account it was lunchtime.
-Yeah, we was gonna have hot dogs.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.843
Okay, now getting back to the squid here.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.762
[fleshy palpations squelching]

01:36.679 --> 01:39.682
Dan, Jessica, I don't know
what is happening right now.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.811
Something is moving inside the squid.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.105
I don't know if you guys
are getting this in the studio,

01:45.188 --> 01:46.815
but there seems like there's a…

01:46.898 --> 01:48.691
I… I mean, this is incredible,

01:48.775 --> 01:51.778
but I think I see a… face.

01:51.861 --> 01:53.071
-Here.
-[Stone] Yes, yes.

01:53.154 --> 01:57.367
Uh, they are cutting inside the squid
to find out what is in there.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.160
[eerie, cryptic music playing]

01:59.244 --> 02:00.453
Okay.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.454
[figure grunting]

02:01.538 --> 02:03.540
[music intensifies]

02:05.583 --> 02:07.001
What the fuck?

02:08.878 --> 02:10.713
Can you tell us what happened?

02:16.010 --> 02:16.970
The Cleanse.

02:17.887 --> 02:21.599
As you can see, many questions remain.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.643
What is the Cleanse?

02:23.726 --> 02:25.520
Who is this little girl?

02:25.603 --> 02:29.816
Where did she come from,
and where will she go from here?

02:30.567 --> 02:32.193
[Tenenbaum] Thanks for that report,
Bailey.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.488
Now, let's go to Liza King
in our Channel 9 chopper…

02:35.572 --> 02:37.574
[cryptic music building]

02:41.494 --> 02:42.495
[music trails off]

02:51.504 --> 02:55.049
Leave it to this clown car of a family
to botch a simple search and rescue.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.551
For a second there, we had her.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.928
Who were those weirdos
with the fanny packs?

02:59.012 --> 03:01.764
Was it me,
or did they smell like wet sheep?

03:01.848 --> 03:03.266
Goats, I thought.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.226
-Mmm.
-Maybe llamas.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.436
[Diego] Who cares?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.022
And why did they call you Nancy?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.445
Their names are Gene and Jean.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.157
They run an underground organization
called the Keepers.

03:19.991 --> 03:20.909
Sex cult?

03:21.492 --> 03:22.619
No, not a sex cult--

03:22.702 --> 03:25.163
Once you get to the top,
it's always a sex cult.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.539
Yeah. The man's got a point.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.876
[Five] They're an extremist group
who believe they have memories

03:29.959 --> 03:31.502
from an alternate timeline.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.088
-Some of their memories are bang on.
-[Five] Yeah.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.384
They're calling this phenomenon
the "Umbrella Effect."

03:39.928 --> 03:41.888
Ugh. How is this even possible?

03:41.971 --> 03:44.182
Well, you know,
we're still working on that.

03:45.433 --> 03:46.935
What do they want with Jennifer?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.939
Great. You don't know that either.

03:51.022 --> 03:52.398
Hey, hey, hey.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.275
Are you okay?

03:54.359 --> 03:56.986
I'm absolutely fine, thanks to you.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.659
Look. Are you mad at me
because I saved your life?

04:02.742 --> 04:04.535
I was very clear, was I not?

04:04.619 --> 04:07.205
No marigold.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.791
I know, Klaus.
What was I supposed to do? Let you die?

04:09.874 --> 04:13.086
I know. It's just three whole years
down the drain.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.006
Three years clean and sober.
But this is what you wanted, right?

04:20.051 --> 04:21.302
What are you talking about?

04:21.386 --> 04:24.847
I'm talking about this.
Our little parasitic relationship.

04:24.931 --> 04:28.601
The eternal screwup and his holy savior.

04:29.227 --> 04:30.228
As long as I'm around,

04:30.311 --> 04:33.398
you don't have to look directly
at your empty pit of a life.

04:33.481 --> 04:36.526
Wow! You know what?
Maybe you should take it down a notch.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.362
No, I think I'll take it up a notch,
shall we?

04:39.445 --> 04:42.907
I mean, dysfunction is, after all,
what we do best in this family.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.576
[squawking] We got daddy issues!
Daddy issues!

04:45.660 --> 04:46.995
Chaos junkie.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.706
Mommy issues.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.124
More daddy issues.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.960
Obnoxious asshole issues.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.587
Then you…

04:58.506 --> 05:02.302
you seem kind of weirdly self-actualized,
as far as I can tell.

05:02.385 --> 05:06.055
Anyway, I'm just so done living,

05:06.139 --> 05:10.560
cowering in your
little bubble of superiority.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.896
So this is the thanks I get
for taking care of you

05:13.980 --> 05:15.273
for the past five years?

05:15.356 --> 05:18.151
-I think you've got that back-to-front.
-Oh!

05:18.234 --> 05:20.570
Who took care of you since Ray walked out?

05:20.653 --> 05:22.280
None of these guys gave a shit.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.781
Who took care of little Claire

05:23.865 --> 05:27.327
while you bombed
every shitty audition in town?

05:27.410 --> 05:30.747
So you think that I like
having a grown man living in my basement,

05:30.830 --> 05:33.875
covering my entire house in bubble wrap?

05:33.958 --> 05:37.670
You think I like picking your sorry ass up
every time you hit rock bottom?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.340
[hoarsely] Bottom? Moi?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.720
There's no bottom here, missy.
No bottom at all.

05:45.803 --> 05:48.222
I'm the goddamn Mariana Trench!

05:49.098 --> 05:51.309
-Wait till you see.
-You know what? Fine.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.395
-Fine. Jump off the deep end.
-I will.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.356
That is so clearly what you wanna do.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.900
Have fun, and see if I give a shit!

05:59.650 --> 06:00.485
Thank you.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.487
Truly, thank you.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.114
Finally, a grain of honesty.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.742
It feels good.
[inhales sharply] Feels refreshing!

06:08.242 --> 06:11.329
You wanted the old Klaus. You got him.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.458
-[Luther] Come on.
-[Viktor] What are you doing?

06:15.541 --> 06:18.544
-[Diego] Look out, Klaus!
-[horn blaring]

06:18.628 --> 06:20.797
You know what? Actually, while we're here,

06:20.880 --> 06:23.549
does anybody else have some shit
they wanna get off their chest?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.801
Because now's the time.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.055
No?

06:30.848 --> 06:31.808
No takers?

06:33.226 --> 06:35.603
Good. I'm done being
the bad guy in this family.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.527
Now that the show's over,
what are we going to do about Jennifer?

06:42.610 --> 06:43.820
We need to find her.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.908
We're not going anywhere
in this piece of shit. [sighs]

06:48.991 --> 06:51.285
He said I was the best one, so…

06:51.369 --> 06:52.286
Just saying.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.663
[quirky note plays]

07:00.086 --> 07:01.003
Careful.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.422
[mechanic] Mm-hmm.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.965
-Careful.
-Yeah, sure.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.052
[shrill, distressing music building]

07:09.053 --> 07:10.179
[Luther] Hey, Ben?

07:10.263 --> 07:11.722
What? What do you want?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.475
Uh, it's three o'clock.

07:15.184 --> 07:17.061
Time to check in with your parole officer.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.773
Oh, right. I can't wait to catch him up
on what I've been up to.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.234
Crossing state lines,
shooting up a whole town,

07:23.317 --> 07:24.735
flipping a Volkswagen.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.779
Good idea.

07:26.863 --> 07:27.697
Moron.

07:30.074 --> 07:30.908
All right.

07:31.742 --> 07:34.162
[Five] I need a run
on a Chrysler LeBaron Town & Country,

07:34.871 --> 07:36.330
'80, '81.

07:37.039 --> 07:41.127
Brown, simulated woodgrain sides,
New Mexico plates.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.297
Look for matches
with an owner first name Gene.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.508
That is Golf-Echo-November-Echo.

07:47.592 --> 07:51.137
Or Jean.
That's Juliet-Echo-Alpha-November.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.722
[Luther] Know what's strange?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.309
All those people back in New Grumpson.

07:57.059 --> 08:00.688
They were wearing
Hargreeves-branded military gear.

08:01.189 --> 08:04.275
Luther, the entire goddamn place
was a Hargreeves town.

08:04.358 --> 08:07.195
[Ben] It's like it was designed
to keep Jennifer hostage.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.030
What's so important about her anyway?

08:10.239 --> 08:11.407
[Allison] Isn't it obvious?

08:11.491 --> 08:12.742
She's one of us.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.328
-No. No way.
-[Five] I mean, that would make sense.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.580
Why else would Dad build
a Truman Show around her?

08:17.663 --> 08:19.332
The guy played us, all right?

08:19.415 --> 08:21.542
Nothing Jennifer said
jibed with Sy's story.

08:21.626 --> 08:24.921
They're both gone now,
so that leaves us with two shitty options.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.841
We either go after the Keepers
or, worse, talk to Dad.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.218
[sardonic chuckle]

08:30.301 --> 08:31.552
[Diego] Come on, man.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.764
Think we need to split up. Me and Lila
will follow up with the Keepers.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.432
The rest of you go talk to Dad.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.517
Uh-uh.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.310
I'm going with you.

08:41.103 --> 08:42.772
And I'm going after Jennifer.

08:42.855 --> 08:44.649
It's better if we stick together.

08:44.732 --> 08:45.775
No, it's not.

08:45.858 --> 08:48.361
And this little field trip proved it.

08:49.195 --> 08:52.365
You're awfully gung ho for a person
that didn't wanna go in the first place.

08:52.448 --> 08:55.201
[Ben] You're all a bunch of clowns.
I'm going on my own.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
Ben.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.830
Don't you walk away from me.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.000
And then there were six.

09:16.514 --> 09:17.557
Look.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.476
The reason that they call me Nancy is--

09:20.560 --> 09:21.686
I already know.

09:21.769 --> 09:22.603
Know what?

09:23.187 --> 09:24.355
[sighs]

09:24.438 --> 09:25.523
I followed you.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.900
The other night.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.695
You what?
What, so you're spying on me now?

09:31.612 --> 09:32.822
I saw you.

09:34.782 --> 09:37.159
You were in the café with… with him.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.160
With who?

09:38.661 --> 09:40.121
Don't play dumb.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.959
The little Greek guy with the mustache.

09:46.919 --> 09:47.920
[laughing]

09:52.675 --> 09:54.010
Is that funny to you?

09:54.927 --> 09:59.098
Yeah, trust me.
That is absolutely hilarious.

09:59.181 --> 10:02.226
Our kids are gonna grow up
in a broken home, and you're laughing.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.772
Diego, the… the little guy,

10:06.856 --> 10:08.149
the little Greek guy,

10:08.774 --> 10:09.900
is Five.

10:09.984 --> 10:12.320
[cheeky music playing]

10:12.403 --> 10:15.531
Yeah. We've been undercover
investigating the Keepers.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.491
You've been lying?

10:17.575 --> 10:20.077
And you're working undercover
with the CIA?

10:20.161 --> 10:23.581
This is why I didn't tell you.
You'd have some bizarre reaction.

10:23.664 --> 10:25.207
I'm not having a bizarre reaction.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.169
-You're acting like I had an affair.
-It's worse.

10:28.252 --> 10:31.547
Okay, as much as I would love to unpack
whatever this is,

10:31.631 --> 10:34.467
we have much more important things
to think about.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.135
[brooding music playing]

10:36.218 --> 10:38.220
It's because he's in the CIA, huh?

10:39.013 --> 10:40.931
I'm just a dumb delivery driver.

10:41.015 --> 10:42.475
No, Diego.

10:42.558 --> 10:43.893
Then why?

10:44.685 --> 10:46.854
Because I needed something
for myself, okay?

10:48.481 --> 10:52.318
Something other than changing diapers
and wine moms and ballet class.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.613
At least you get to get
outside the house every day.

10:56.530 --> 11:01.077
I'm just trapped
in this unending suburban hellscape.

11:02.453 --> 11:06.248
I mean, that's good to know.
That the life we built is so bad.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.917
[introspective music playing]

11:08.000 --> 11:09.627
That's not what I meant.

11:09.710 --> 11:14.674
You think I like delivering packages
day in and day out?

11:15.216 --> 11:16.926
Busting my ass?

11:17.009 --> 11:18.094
Oh, trust me.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.221
I'd rather be out there cracking skulls,

11:20.304 --> 11:24.016
but, I mean, somebody's gotta show up
for this marriage, because…

There was no Umbrella Academy in 2006.

about October 14th, 2006?

25:19.559 --> 25:20.685
The day Ben died.

25:21.728 --> 25:22.562
Our Ben.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.189
That's a coincidence.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.410

25:37.494 --> 25:40.872
and the girl gets kidnapped
by two vigilantes in a station wagon.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.250
Now, in their trash,

25:43.333 --> 25:47.087

What? What are you talking about?

28:01.888 --> 28:03.014
I told you.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.058
She's special.

28:06.643 --> 28:08.353
And you're special, too, Ben.

She can't be out there on her own.

is one big, phony-baloney lie.

under the sun. Didn't they, Jean?

30:46.886 --> 30:50.223
and Gene was a MacArthur fellow.

Okay.

41:24.773 --> 41:27.776
how did you regain your powers?

41:27.860 --> 41:31.113
Why did you destroy
the town of New Grumpson?

And…

41:33.115 --> 41:35.367
what have you done with the girl?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.747
Well, it's kind of a long story,

41:39.830 --> 41:42.082

41:42.166 --> 41:45.878
when we were approached by Sy Grossman.

-Oh.
-[Allison] You know what, Reg?

41:50.966 --> 41:52.426
I think the real question is

41:52.510 --> 41:55.262
why you'd build an entire town
to hold a girl prisoner?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.389
Her name is Jennifer.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.351
And I wasn't holding her prisoner.

42:01.185 --> 42:02.520
I was protecting her.

Great. So we can't read it or see it.

is from our original timeline.

as the "Jennifer incident."

intelligence agency.

45:18.090 --> 45:21.343
Psychological warfare was all the rage
in the '60s,

45:21.427 --> 45:23.178
but it was only a brief contract.

45:23.262 --> 45:24.471
Immensely lucrative.

With the human mind,
anything is possible, young man.

you can restore them?

to do with Ben's death.

45:44.116 --> 45:47.536

the Jennifer incident,

45:47.619 --> 45:49.705

50:35.323 --> 50:38.410
You know, a husband and wife
shouldn't have any secrets, Lila.

50:38.910 --> 50:39.911
That's a rule.

50:40.579 --> 50:41.663
You're right.

50:42.748 --> 50:43.874
No more secrets.

50:47.419 --> 50:49.671
I think that we need
a break from each other.

50:49.755 --> 50:52.257
-Time to reassess our marriage.
-[muffled] What?

50:52.340 --> 50:53.842

[system klaxons blaring]

51:14.738 --> 51:17.074
[Luther] Wait! Is this gonna hurt?

51:25.707 --> 51:27.459
[Luther] It was a tragic accident.

51:27.542 --> 51:30.670
[Hargreeves siblings]
Ben died because we failed as a team.

51:31.296 --> 51:35.092
Nobody was responsible,
yet we were all responsible.

51:35.842 --> 51:38.428
Ben Hargreeves represented the best of us.

51:39.930 --> 51:41.848
Ben was the Umbrella Academy.

51:48.021 --> 51:50.899
