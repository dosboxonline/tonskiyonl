01:06.500 --> 01:09.003
This is Mr Mathison.
He's a doctor.

01:10.671 --> 01:14.717
- Are you okay?
- An ambulance is on the way.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.802
Thank you.

01:23.017 --> 01:25.019
Is there a name yet?

01:26.270 --> 01:28.272
Elijah.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.821
Is he supposed
to be crying like this?

01:35.905 --> 01:37.907
May I?

01:53.339 --> 01:55.341
Can I have him back?

01:59.929 --> 02:02.223
What happened during the delivery?

02:02.306 --> 02:04.976
Nothing.
It was very quick.

02:05.059 --> 02:07.228
The baby just wanted
to come right out.

02:07.311 --> 02:09.312
And there were no problems.

02:11.482 --> 02:13.776
Did you drop him?

02:13.859 --> 02:15.861
What?

02:15.945 --> 02:18.072
Did you drop this baby?

02:18.155 --> 02:20.157
Jesus Christ, no.

02:25.329 --> 02:28.332
Inform the ambulance
that we have a situation.

02:28.416 --> 02:31.377
All right.
Molly.

02:31.460 --> 02:34.297
I've never seen this.

02:37.258 --> 02:41.137
It appears that your baby
has sustained some fractures...

02:41.220 --> 02:43.222
while inside your uterus.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.769
His arms and his legs are broken.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.072
This is Eastrail 177.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.282
Next stop, Philadelphia.

04:17.233 --> 04:19.235
Are you alone?

04:20.903 --> 04:22.989
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:09.035 --> 05:11.245
Someone left this magazine.

05:11.329 --> 05:13.331
Want to take a look at it?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.416
Could I take a look at that one?

05:21.797 --> 05:23.674
Thanks.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.677
- You like sports?
- It's my field.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.763
I represent athletes.
I'm an agent.

05:30.765 --> 05:34.060
Are you looking for any
male synchronized swimmers?

05:34.143 --> 05:36.938
- I'm thinking about getting into that.
- Is that right?

05:40.358 --> 05:42.360
I'm afraid of water.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.445
Think that's a problem?

05:51.953 --> 05:54.872
You represent someone
in Philadelphia?

05:54.956 --> 05:57.208
I'm meeting this player
from Temple University.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.293
He's a cornerback.

05:59.377 --> 06:03.130
This kid is 6'1 ", 210 pounds.

06:03.214 --> 06:07.385
He runs a 40 in 4.3 seconds.
He's gonna be a god.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.471
Do you like football?

06:10.554 --> 06:12.556
Not really.

06:23.818 --> 06:27.530
- I'm David Dunn.
- Kelly.

06:27.613 --> 06:30.366
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

06:30.449 --> 06:32.451
Nice-Nice to meet you.

06:40.042 --> 06:42.628
How long are you gonna be
in Philadelphia?

06:50.761 --> 06:53.889
- I'm married.
- Great.

06:53.973 --> 06:56.809
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

06:59.604 --> 07:01.856
I-

07:01.939 --> 07:06.235
I think you misunderstood
what I was, uh...

07:06.319 --> 07:08.487
- s-saying-
- I know.

07:11.073 --> 07:13.409
I think I'm gonna find another seat.

07:13.492 --> 07:15.953
I- I didn't mean, uh-

08:55.594 --> 08:58.889
That's what he failed to realize.
I look classy, not trashy.

08:58.973 --> 09:03.811
I look classy too. What about me?
Don't I look classy?

09:03.894 --> 09:06.314
But I'm afraid you forgot this!

09:06.397 --> 09:10.568
- And this! And-
- Where has you been, Banana?

09:10.651 --> 09:12.903
Now I've got you, weasel.

09:12.987 --> 09:17.700
Some cars are still on fire,
and the debris is everywhere.

09:17.783 --> 09:19.702
We are not sure at this time, uh...

09:19.785 --> 09:22.288
how rescue personnel will be able
to get on scene at all.

09:22.371 --> 09:24.957
If you're just tuning in,
Eastrail train number 177...

09:25.041 --> 09:27.460
has derailed
just outside Philadelphia.

09:27.543 --> 09:29.879
And we're bringing you
live coverage from Skycam 4.

09:29.962 --> 09:32.298
Yes, that is- It appears
to be a rescue ambulance...

09:32.381 --> 09:35.301
and there are more behind it
I can see on the access road.

09:35.384 --> 09:37.887
I don't know how close they're
gonna be able to get, David.

09:37.970 --> 09:40.765
These are woods and, uh, trees.

09:40.848 --> 09:43.267
It's gonna be a very
difficult rescue effort.

09:59.367 --> 10:01.369
Try to hack some of that off.

10:14.256 --> 10:17.969
Hi. I'm Dr Dubin.

10:18.052 --> 10:21.764
You're in the emergency room in
the Philadelphia City Hospital.

10:21.847 --> 10:23.849
You were in a serious accident.

10:24.976 --> 10:27.270
Look at me.

10:27.353 --> 10:29.355
How are you feeling?

10:31.232 --> 10:33.442
- Okay.
- Good.

10:33.526 --> 10:35.987
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

10:36.070 --> 10:39.865
Have you ever had any heart
or asthma problems in the past?

10:39.949 --> 10:44.120
- No.
- Kidney or renal problems?

10:44.203 --> 10:46.706
- No.
- Any allergies?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.085
No.

10:55.881 --> 10:57.883
Where were you sitting
on the train?

11:01.887 --> 11:04.724
- Against the window.
- In the passenger car?

11:06.976 --> 11:08.978
Yeah.

11:11.188 --> 11:14.942
- Where are the other passengers?
- Was your family travelling with you?

11:17.612 --> 11:19.530
No.

11:19.614 --> 11:22.325
Did you get up from your seat?

11:27.955 --> 11:31.000
Are you certain
you were in the passenger car?

11:36.255 --> 11:38.257
Yes.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.643
Why are you looking at me like that?

11:48.726 --> 11:50.770
Your train derailed.

11:50.853 --> 11:53.606
Some kind of malfunction.

11:53.689 --> 11:56.651
They only found
two people alive so far-

11:56.734 --> 11:58.736
you and this man.

12:01.113 --> 12:04.450
His skull was cracked open and
most of his left side was crushed.

12:06.619 --> 12:08.746
And to answer your question,
there are two reasons...

12:08.829 --> 12:11.874
why I'm looking at you like this.

12:11.958 --> 12:14.752
One, because it seems
in a few minutes...

12:14.835 --> 12:19.131
that you will officially be
the only survivor of this train wreck.

12:19.215 --> 12:22.134
And two...

12:22.218 --> 12:24.220
because you didn't break one bone.

12:25.638 --> 12:27.640
You don't have a scratch on you.

14:13.704 --> 14:15.665
David?

14:18.334 --> 14:22.254
What happened in New York?

14:24.090 --> 14:26.467
I don't think I got the job.

14:28.302 --> 14:31.472
I'm still going to, uh-

14:31.555 --> 14:34.308
I'm still moving there.

14:34.392 --> 14:36.394
Just-

14:37.520 --> 14:39.522
Uh, just-just not now.

14:44.527 --> 14:46.696
Good night.

14:49.824 --> 14:51.826
Good night.

15:03.796 --> 15:05.840
Sara Elaston...

15:05.923 --> 15:09.093
social worker at
Broad and Locust Community Centre.

15:10.344 --> 15:12.513
We pray for your soul.

15:14.682 --> 15:17.810
Kevin Elliot, businessman...

15:17.893 --> 15:20.771
father of six.

15:20.855 --> 15:22.857
We pray for your soul.

15:24.442 --> 15:26.611
Glen Stevens...

15:26.694 --> 15:29.989
researcher in the area
of leukemia...

15:30.072 --> 15:32.074
at Drexel University.

15:33.868 --> 15:35.870
We pray for your soul.

15:37.663 --> 15:39.832
Jennifer Pennyman...

15:39.915 --> 15:44.086
third-grade teacher
at Jefferson Elementary.

15:46.297 --> 15:48.299
We pray for your soul.

16:55.366 --> 16:58.536
- Yes?
- Is Noel in, ma'am?

16:58.619 --> 17:00.621
No, sir, he is not.

17:02.039 --> 17:04.875
I read about you in the paper.

17:04.959 --> 17:08.212
- What?
- I was in an accident once too.

17:08.296 --> 17:11.299
A horse almost trampled me to death.

17:11.382 --> 17:13.384
- Wow.
- Had him put down.

17:16.053 --> 17:18.055
That's a sad story.

17:20.933 --> 17:25.855
Could- Could you ask Noel
something for me, please?

17:25.938 --> 17:28.107
Proceed.

17:28.190 --> 17:30.234
Would you ask him to check
how many sick days I've taken...

17:30.318 --> 17:32.445
since I've worked here?

17:32.528 --> 17:35.406
- That the entire message?
- Yes, ma'am.

17:39.327 --> 17:41.329
Thank you.

18:19.575 --> 18:21.369
Hey, Noel.

18:21.452 --> 18:23.704
What, you hit your head on that train?

18:23.788 --> 18:25.790
Get your brain
to start working again?

18:27.333 --> 18:30.044
- What?
- Forty dollars.

18:31.671 --> 18:34.382
- Forty dollars what?
- You're gettin' a $40-a-week raise.

18:34.465 --> 18:36.467
That's it.

18:37.593 --> 18:40.805
I checked. You were right.
You've never taken a sick day.

18:40.888 --> 18:44.600
Five years, no sick day.
I get it. You want a raise.

18:44.684 --> 18:46.644
Smart way to make your point.

19:13.379 --> 19:15.965
- Is Joseph okay?
- Yeah.

19:16.048 --> 19:18.593
- He's asleep.
- Oh.

19:22.597 --> 19:25.725
I wanted to ask you a question.

19:25.808 --> 19:28.019
It's gonna sound a little strange,
but, uh...

19:28.102 --> 19:31.063
just think about it for a second, okay?

19:31.147 --> 19:33.858
Okay.

19:33.941 --> 19:36.110
When's the last time I was sick?

19:36.193 --> 19:38.195
Do you remember?

19:41.741 --> 19:43.743
Um, I-I don't know.

19:45.786 --> 19:48.623
It's been a while.

19:48.706 --> 19:52.501
I haven't been sick this year,
I know that.

19:52.585 --> 19:54.712
Okay.

19:54.795 --> 19:56.797
Do you remember me gettin' sick?

19:59.967 --> 20:02.261
Um...

20:02.345 --> 20:04.639
not a specific day.

20:04.722 --> 20:06.933
And what's-what's this about?

20:09.226 --> 20:12.772
Audrey, do you remember me
ever getting sick?

20:12.855 --> 20:15.733
In the three years
we lived in this house?

20:15.816 --> 20:17.902
In the old apartment?

20:17.985 --> 20:20.947
Before Joseph was born?
Before we ever got married?

20:25.284 --> 20:27.286
I- I can't remember.

20:29.163 --> 20:31.499
Don't you think
that's kind of weird...

20:31.582 --> 20:35.753
not remembering one cold
or a-a fever or a sore throat?

20:38.047 --> 20:40.049
What do you think it means?

20:44.804 --> 20:47.723
Um...

20:47.807 --> 20:51.686
I think it means
I'm probably too tired to remember.

21:33.102 --> 21:37.481
No more sittin' in this room.
I let it go on long enough.

21:37.565 --> 21:40.735
I'm not goin' out there any more.
I'm not getting hurt again.

21:40.818 --> 21:45.156
- This was the last time, I told you.
- You can't do anything about that.

21:45.239 --> 21:47.575
You might fall between
this chair and that television.

21:47.658 --> 21:50.661
If that's what God has planned for you,
that's what's gonna happen.

21:50.745 --> 21:53.164
You can't hide from it
sittin' in a room.

21:57.209 --> 22:01.047
They call me Mr Glass at school
because I break like glass.

22:06.177 --> 22:08.179
You make this decision now...

22:09.597 --> 22:11.599
to be afraid...

22:13.225 --> 22:15.394
and you will never turn back.

22:17.104 --> 22:21.943
Your whole life,
you will always be afraid.

22:36.749 --> 22:39.293
- I got a present for you.
- Why?

22:41.003 --> 22:43.005
Forget why.

22:45.591 --> 22:47.593
You want it or not?

22:50.554 --> 22:52.765
Well, go get it, then.

22:52.848 --> 22:55.810
Where is it?

22:55.893 --> 22:58.521
On a bench...

22:58.604 --> 23:00.606
across the street.

23:14.662 --> 23:16.664
Someone's gonna take it.

23:18.666 --> 23:21.419
Then you better get out there soon.

24:35.868 --> 24:37.870
I bought a whole bunch.

24:42.375 --> 24:44.460
There'll be one of these
waitin' for you...

24:44.543 --> 24:46.712
every time you want
to come out here.

24:53.427 --> 24:56.555
They say this one
has a surprise ending.

25:05.439 --> 25:08.484
This is from Fritz Campion's
own library.

25:08.567 --> 25:13.489
This is before the first issue of
the comic book hit the stands in 1968.

25:13.572 --> 25:17.618
It's a classic depiction
of good versus evil.

25:17.702 --> 25:21.706
Notice the square jaw of Slayer,
common in most comic heroes.

25:21.789 --> 25:25.543
And the slightly disproportionate size
of Jaguaro's head to his body.

25:25.626 --> 25:29.714
This again is common,
but only in villains.

25:29.797 --> 25:32.216
The thing to notice about this piece...

25:32.300 --> 25:36.304
the thing that makes it
very, very special...

25:36.387 --> 25:39.473
is its realistic depiction
of its figures.

25:39.557 --> 25:41.601
When the characters
reached the magazine...

25:41.684 --> 25:43.769
they were exaggerated...

25:43.853 --> 25:46.105
as always happens.

25:46.188 --> 25:49.942
This is vintage.

25:52.820 --> 25:54.822
Well...

25:59.910 --> 26:02.413
wrap it up.

26:02.496 --> 26:04.915
You've made a considerably
wise decision.

26:10.338 --> 26:12.340
Well, my kid's gonna go berserk.

26:15.885 --> 26:17.929
Once again, please?

26:18.012 --> 26:20.806
My son Jeb-
it's a gift for him.

26:20.890 --> 26:23.768
- How old is Jeb?
- He's four.

26:26.771 --> 26:28.856
No.

26:28.940 --> 26:32.693
No, no, no, no, no.

26:34.195 --> 26:36.572
You need to go. Now.

26:38.366 --> 26:40.493
What'd-What'd I say?

26:40.576 --> 26:43.913
Do you see any Teletubbies in here?

26:43.996 --> 26:46.040
Do you see a slender plastic tag
clipped to my shirt...

26:46.123 --> 26:48.292
with my name printed on it?

26:48.376 --> 26:51.295
Did you see a little Asian child with
a blank expression sitting outside...

26:51.379 --> 26:55.132
in a mechanical helicopter that shakes
when you put quarters in it?

26:55.216 --> 26:58.844
No? Well, that's what
you see at a toy store...

26:58.928 --> 27:00.930
and you must think
you're in a toy store because...

27:01.013 --> 27:04.558
you're here shopping
for an infant named Jeb.

27:04.642 --> 27:07.645
Now, one of us
has made a gross error...

27:07.728 --> 27:10.940
and wasted the other person's
valuable time.

27:11.023 --> 27:13.150
This is an art gallery,
my friend...

27:13.234 --> 27:16.988
and this is a piece of art.

27:32.336 --> 27:34.338
We're by appointment only.

27:36.090 --> 27:38.718
- I got a card from this store.
- Congratulations.

27:38.801 --> 27:42.430
You have a mailbox.
The exhibition isn't for two weeks.

27:42.513 --> 27:45.349
This one was under
the windshield wiper of my car.

27:48.227 --> 27:51.314
How certain are you that
you've never taken ill?

27:51.397 --> 27:53.941
Seventy-five percent.

27:54.025 --> 27:57.486
Well, that's not
certain at all, is it?

27:58.904 --> 28:01.824
That's hole number one.

28:01.907 --> 28:05.119
I'm going to be extremely skeptical
about all this.

28:05.202 --> 28:07.204
About all what?

28:08.706 --> 28:11.917
I'm assuming you've never been injured.
Would I be wrong in that assumption?

28:12.001 --> 28:14.003
Dad's been injured.

28:15.296 --> 28:18.299
Is the child correct?

28:18.382 --> 28:22.511
Yes, sir. In college,
I was in a car accident.

28:22.595 --> 28:27.475
- Was it serious?
- He couldn't play football any more.

28:27.558 --> 28:29.560
That's hole number two.

28:31.354 --> 28:33.356
That's a big one.

28:36.943 --> 28:40.905
Mr Price, can we talk about
the note that you left on my car?

28:40.988 --> 28:44.241
I've studied the form
of comics intimately.

28:44.325 --> 28:46.369
I've spent a third of my life
in a hospital bed...

28:46.452 --> 28:49.622
with nothing else to do but read.

28:49.705 --> 28:51.707
I believe comics
are our last link...

28:51.791 --> 28:55.503
to an ancient way
of passing on history.

28:55.586 --> 28:57.755
The Egyptians drew on walls.

28:57.838 --> 29:02.093
Countries all over the world still pass
on knowledge through pictorial forms.

29:02.176 --> 29:04.345
I believe comics
are a form of history...

29:04.428 --> 29:08.015
that someone somewhere
felt or experienced.

29:08.099 --> 29:10.434
Then, of course,
those experiences and that history...

29:10.518 --> 29:13.562
got chewed up in the commercial
machine, got jazzed up...

29:13.646 --> 29:16.524
made titillating,
cartooned for the sale rack.

29:17.900 --> 29:21.320
This city has seen its share
of disasters.

29:21.404 --> 29:23.906
I watched the aftermath
of that plane crash.

29:23.990 --> 29:26.534
I watched the carnage
of the hotel fire.

29:26.617 --> 29:31.539
I watched the news waiting to hear
a very specific combination of words...

29:31.622 --> 29:34.125
but they never came.

29:34.208 --> 29:37.962
Then one day I saw a news story
about a train accident...

29:38.045 --> 29:40.089
and I heard them.

29:40.172 --> 29:42.258
"There is a sole survivor...

29:42.341 --> 29:45.469
and he is miraculously unharmed."

29:48.472 --> 29:51.934
I have something called
osteogenesis imperfecta.

29:52.018 --> 29:54.020
It's a genetic disorder.

29:54.103 --> 29:56.105
I don't make a particular
protein very well...

29:56.188 --> 29:58.733
and it makes my bones
very low in density.

29:58.816 --> 30:01.110
Very easy to break.

30:01.193 --> 30:03.738
I've had 54 breaks in my life...

30:03.821 --> 30:08.618
and I have the tamest version
of this disorder, type one.

30:08.701 --> 30:12.413
There are type two,
type three, type four.

30:12.496 --> 30:14.498
Type fours don't last very long.

30:16.125 --> 30:19.128
So that's how it popped into my head.

30:19.211 --> 30:22.048
If there is someone
like me in the world...

30:22.131 --> 30:24.383
and I'm at one end
of the spectrum...

30:24.467 --> 30:26.510
couldn't there be someone else...

30:26.594 --> 30:28.846
the opposite of me
at the other end?

30:28.930 --> 30:33.309
Someone who doesn't get sick, who
doesn't get hurt like the rest of us?

30:33.392 --> 30:37.188
And he probably
doesn't even know it.

30:37.271 --> 30:42.485
The kind of person
these stories are about.

30:42.568 --> 30:47.698
A person put here
to protect the rest of us.

30:47.782 --> 30:49.867
To guard us.

30:52.286 --> 30:56.874
- You think my dad's a real-
- I don't think anything right now.

30:56.958 --> 30:59.418
It's a possibility-

30:59.502 --> 31:01.504
one with many holes.

31:05.049 --> 31:07.718
Joseph, don't take
another sip of that water.

31:10.888 --> 31:12.974
- Go throw it in the trash.
- But Dad-

31:13.057 --> 31:15.059
Do it now, please.

31:24.694 --> 31:28.322
I see guys like you
all the time in my work.

31:28.406 --> 31:31.909
You find someone you want
to take advantage of...

31:31.993 --> 31:35.454
you tell them a fantastic story...

31:35.538 --> 31:38.416
and somewhere in there you say it:

31:38.499 --> 31:41.460
"I just need your credit card number...

31:41.544 --> 31:43.546
a small down payment."

31:46.215 --> 31:48.217
This morning was the first morning
that I could remember...

31:48.301 --> 31:50.303
that I didn't open my eyes
and feel...

31:53.139 --> 31:55.266
sadness.

31:58.853 --> 32:02.023
I thought the person that wrote
that note had an answer for me.

32:08.946 --> 32:11.991
I'm gonna leave now.

32:12.074 --> 32:14.076
Good luck with your exhibition.

32:14.160 --> 32:16.662
So, what kind of job do you have, David?

32:16.746 --> 32:18.789
You said you've met guys like me
in your work.

32:18.873 --> 32:23.461
- What exactly is it that you do?
- I work at the University Stadium.

32:23.544 --> 32:26.130
I'm a security guard.

34:41.806 --> 34:44.018
Hi.

34:44.101 --> 34:46.938
I've come to a decision.

34:47.021 --> 34:49.398
Okay.

34:49.482 --> 34:52.025
I just wanna ask you something, okay?

34:52.109 --> 34:55.655
And you can be totally honest.

34:55.737 --> 34:59.367
I'm prepared for any answer,
and-and it won't affect me.

35:01.953 --> 35:04.747
Have you been with anyone?

35:04.830 --> 35:07.083
I mean, since we've
been having problems.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.168
The answer won't affect me.

35:12.380 --> 35:15.049
I just need to know, you know?

35:15.132 --> 35:17.134
I mean, it won't affect me
either way.

35:19.553 --> 35:21.555
No.

35:29.438 --> 35:31.691
Sorry, David.
I'm sorry.

35:36.988 --> 35:39.156
Anyway...

35:39.240 --> 35:41.242
my decision is...

35:44.495 --> 35:46.497
that I want to start again.

35:50.126 --> 35:52.878
And I want it to be
like it was in the beginning.

35:56.257 --> 35:59.594
And it's a big deal that
you walked away from that train.

36:02.555 --> 36:04.599
I feel like it's a second chance.

36:10.813 --> 36:14.066
And if you feel like
asking me out sometime...

36:14.150 --> 36:16.152
that'd be okay.

36:18.613 --> 36:20.615
Okay.

36:33.294 --> 36:35.838
- Dunn.
- Go for Dunn.

36:35.922 --> 36:40.217
Yeah, it's Jenkins. Look, we got a guy
over at gate 17-C with a bogus ticket.

36:40.301 --> 36:44.347
Says he knows you.
He won't tell me his name.

36:44.430 --> 36:47.141
What's he look like?

36:47.224 --> 36:49.435
Why is it, do you think, that
of all the professions in the world...

36:49.518 --> 36:51.520
you chose protection?

36:53.606 --> 36:56.400
- You are a very strange man.
- You could have been a tax accountant.

36:56.484 --> 36:59.362
You could have owned your own gym. You
could've opened a chain of restaurants.

36:59.445 --> 37:01.864
You could've done
one of 10,000 things.

37:01.948 --> 37:06.077
But in the end,
you chose to protect people.

37:06.160 --> 37:08.663
You made that decision,
and I find that...

37:08.746 --> 37:10.748
very, very interesting.

37:12.041 --> 37:14.961
Now all I need is
your credit card number.

37:16.087 --> 37:18.089
That last part was a joke.

37:22.260 --> 37:26.764
- You're a big sports fan, are you?
- It's starting to intrigue me.

37:28.057 --> 37:30.476
It gets heaviest
ten minutes before kickoff.

37:42.863 --> 37:45.157
Programme here.
Programme.

37:45.241 --> 37:47.243
Programme.

37:49.036 --> 37:52.832
Programme. Programme here.

37:52.915 --> 37:54.917
- Rich, why don't we pat down?
- Right.

37:55.001 --> 37:57.003
- Just give me a minute.
- Is there a problem?

37:57.086 --> 37:59.088
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to search you.

37:59.171 --> 38:02.550
- It's nothing personal.
- The tall guy in the camouflage jacket.

38:02.633 --> 38:07.179
Sometimes people carry weapons in here,
and they drink too much.

38:07.263 --> 38:11.934
If the team's not doing good,
bad things can happen.

38:12.018 --> 38:15.271
We do pat-downs of the crowd
to discourage people from carrying.

38:16.689 --> 38:19.317
If he's carrying,
he'll step out of line.

38:32.455 --> 38:34.457
Yeah, step right up here.

38:43.591 --> 38:48.387
Okay. I got you a seat up
in the yellow section.

38:48.471 --> 38:53.309
It's in the nosebleeds,
but at least you won't get spit on.

38:53.392 --> 38:55.645
- All right.
- How'd you know that guy you bumped...

38:55.728 --> 38:57.730
was carrying a weapon?

38:59.857 --> 39:02.109
I don't know.

39:02.193 --> 39:06.614
Maybe it was that camouflage
army jacket he was wearing.

39:06.697 --> 39:09.450
Those guys like to carry
hunting knives and stuff for show.

39:09.533 --> 39:12.912
You thought he was carrying a knife?

39:12.995 --> 39:16.082
- I thought he was carrying something, yeah.
- But not a knife.

39:19.710 --> 39:24.674
I got a picture of a silver gun
with a black grip...

39:24.757 --> 39:27.009
tucked in his pants.

39:27.093 --> 39:29.470
You know, like on TV.

39:30.930 --> 39:33.766
You have good instincts
for things like that?

39:33.849 --> 39:37.270
- Like what?
- Knowing when people have done something wrong?

39:40.773 --> 39:43.901
- Yeah.
- Have you ever tried to develop it?

39:45.861 --> 39:49.949
- I don't know what you're asking me.
- Your skill.

39:50.032 --> 39:52.201
Look, I gotta be down on
the sidelines during the game.

39:52.285 --> 39:54.537
- You can get to your seat right down-
- Characters in comics...

39:54.620 --> 39:57.123
are often attributed special powers-

39:57.206 --> 40:01.669
invisibility, X-ray vision,
things of that sort.

40:01.752 --> 40:04.338
Okay.

40:04.422 --> 40:09.051
- I don't wanna play this game any more.
- It's an exaggeration of the truth.

40:09.135 --> 40:14.348
Maybe it's based on something
as simple as instinct.

40:14.432 --> 40:17.059
- But he might not have been carrying anything.
- But he might have been carrying...

40:17.143 --> 40:20.021
a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in his pants.

40:20.104 --> 40:22.940
- Dunn.
- I gotta go.

40:25.359 --> 40:27.612
Yeah, I know.
I'll be right down.

40:27.695 --> 40:30.906
- One last question.
- What?

40:30.990 --> 40:33.367
That car accident you were in.

40:33.451 --> 40:35.453
Was there anyone else involved?

40:37.663 --> 40:41.000
Yeah.
My wife, Audrey.

40:41.083 --> 40:43.169
She was in the car with me.

40:45.254 --> 40:48.174
Have a good life, Elijah.

40:48.257 --> 40:51.636
Next time, try to buy your tickets
at an authorized sales location.

40:51.719 --> 40:55.765
- Dunn.
- I'm on my way.

40:59.810 --> 41:02.063
...into the investigation
of train 177...

41:02.146 --> 41:05.316
being conducted at the Eastrail
holding warehouses.

41:05.399 --> 41:07.944
The city council has
stepped up plans to pass a bill...

41:08.027 --> 41:11.364
requiring higher standards
for inspection and maintenance...

41:11.447 --> 41:14.116
of all rail transportation
for Philadelphia...

41:14.200 --> 41:16.202
and its outlying districts.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.628
Hold up a second!

42:20.641 --> 42:23.269
I just want to ask you something.

43:33.005 --> 43:35.675
Dad! Hey, Dad!

43:42.598 --> 43:44.600
Dad!

43:55.653 --> 43:59.407
Joseph, do you know how mad your mother would
be if she knew you were playing football?

43:59.490 --> 44:02.326
Are you gonna tell?

44:02.410 --> 44:05.871
You wanna play last of the downs?
We got a big guy like you.

44:05.955 --> 44:10.084
You could play on opposite sides.
He's Potter's cousin.

44:10.167 --> 44:12.712
He's starting cornerback
at Temple University.

44:12.795 --> 44:14.880
He's going pro in the draft.

44:14.964 --> 44:18.426
They say he can run the 40
in 4.3 seconds.

44:18.509 --> 44:20.428
Yeah, I've heard.

44:20.511 --> 44:22.513
You can beat him, Dad.

44:22.597 --> 44:25.057
- Let's beat him.
- I'm gonna go in.

44:25.141 --> 44:27.768
Just play one set of downs.
I told them you were great.

44:27.852 --> 44:29.854
- Why'd you do that?
- Just one.

44:29.937 --> 44:32.064
I'm gonna go in.
I've got some things to do.

44:32.148 --> 44:34.942
- What things?
- I'm gonna work out.

44:35.026 --> 44:36.652
- I'll help you.
- No, I-I don't need-

44:36.736 --> 44:40.531
I can't play, guys!
I'm working out with my dad!

44:40.615 --> 44:43.618
Go, go.
Here we go! Ready?

44:43.701 --> 44:46.912
Hut! You're doing good.
Right there! Catch!

44:46.996 --> 44:49.290
I've got to run

44:49.373 --> 44:51.959
To keep from hiding

44:52.043 --> 44:54.378
And I'm bound

44:54.462 --> 44:56.964
To keep on riding

44:57.048 --> 45:01.677
And I've got one more silver dollar

45:01.761 --> 45:03.888
How much did you put on there?

45:12.772 --> 45:16.567
You put too much.
That's 250 pounds.

45:16.651 --> 45:20.446
How much can you lift?

45:20.529 --> 45:22.573
That's the most I ever lifted.

45:25.076 --> 45:27.870
That could've been dangerous, Joseph.

45:27.954 --> 45:30.331
Why don't you go upstairs now
and let me finish up, okay?

45:30.414 --> 45:33.209
I'll take it off.
I'll help you right.

45:37.672 --> 45:41.342
You think you could have
beaten up Bruce Lee?

45:41.425 --> 45:43.261
No.

45:43.344 --> 45:45.846
I mean, if you knew karate.

45:45.930 --> 45:47.932
No.

45:51.978 --> 45:55.106
Well, what if he wasn't allowed to kick,
and you were really mad at him?

45:55.189 --> 45:57.191
No, Joseph.

46:38.524 --> 46:41.235
How much did you take off?

46:43.112 --> 46:45.656
I lied.

46:48.200 --> 46:50.202
You added?

46:58.085 --> 47:00.087
How much is it?

47:01.547 --> 47:03.549
270 pounds.

47:07.094 --> 47:09.096
Let's put more.

47:12.350 --> 47:13.809
Okay.

47:17.980 --> 47:20.733
Why don't you move back a little
just to be safe, okay?

47:53.599 --> 47:55.518
More?

48:06.779 --> 48:10.616
You should never do anything like this.
You know that, right?

48:12.410 --> 48:14.912
What do you do
if something bad happens?

48:14.996 --> 48:17.498
Get Mom.

48:17.582 --> 48:19.458
Right.

48:54.660 --> 48:57.455
How much did you put on that time?

49:01.375 --> 49:03.252
All of it.

49:05.004 --> 49:07.006
What else can we use?

49:33.616 --> 49:35.618
How much is it?

49:44.543 --> 49:46.545
How much is it, Dad?

49:49.507 --> 49:52.051
About 350 pounds.

49:59.267 --> 50:01.227
Fracture of the fifth metacarpal
of the right hand...

50:01.310 --> 50:04.689
as well as multiple fractures of
the sixth, seventh and eighth ribs.

50:04.772 --> 50:07.316
The worst of the injury, however,
was sustained to the right leg...

50:07.400 --> 50:09.402
in the form of a spiral fracture.

50:09.485 --> 50:11.487
There were 14 breaks.

50:11.570 --> 50:14.448
It simply shattered.

50:14.532 --> 50:17.118
They call me Mr Glass.

50:17.201 --> 50:20.913
- Who does?
- Kids.

50:20.997 --> 50:23.082
Are you all right, Mr Price?

50:23.165 --> 50:25.167
Shall I continue?

50:26.502 --> 50:28.879
Pins were placed throughout
the length of the leg.

50:28.963 --> 50:31.716
The use of a wheelchair will be needed
for a two-month period.

50:31.799 --> 50:35.219
The use of crutches will follow
for 12 to 14 months.

50:35.303 --> 50:37.471
Hospital stay will range
from five to eight days...

50:37.555 --> 50:40.391
followed by nine to twelve months
of physical therapy.

50:40.474 --> 50:43.185
Prescribed medication for pain
management will take the usual forms...

50:43.269 --> 50:46.063
of morphine drip, percocet, darvocet.

50:57.575 --> 50:59.660
Your, uh, 10:00 is here.

50:59.744 --> 51:01.871
The hospital discharged him
this morning.

51:04.081 --> 51:06.083
Thanks.

51:14.508 --> 51:15.968
Elijah, right?

51:16.052 --> 51:19.889
We're gonna prevent any substantial
atrophy of your good leg with this...

51:19.972 --> 51:22.224
and it works your quadriceps.

51:23.351 --> 51:25.561
How long have you been married?

51:28.272 --> 51:31.233
- Twelve years.
- How'd you get together?

51:33.486 --> 51:35.488
I'm a little nervous being here.

51:35.571 --> 51:39.033
I ask too many questions
when I'm nervous.

51:41.118 --> 51:43.120
A car accident.

51:43.204 --> 51:46.958
Oh. And now you're gonna
have to tell me more.

51:51.337 --> 51:53.839
My husband was a star athlete
in college...

51:53.923 --> 51:55.967
and we were in
an accident together.

51:57.593 --> 52:01.639
Our car flipped on an icy road and we were both
injured, and he couldn't play football any more.

52:01.722 --> 52:04.517
And if that hadn't happened,
we probably wouldn't have been together.

52:04.600 --> 52:08.312
- How so?
- I think we should talk about your rehab.

52:08.396 --> 52:10.731
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to.

52:11.857 --> 52:15.361
So, tell me more
about the quad machine.

52:16.696 --> 52:19.615
It prevents atrophy by-

52:21.367 --> 52:23.578
I couldn't spend my life
with someone who played football.

52:23.661 --> 52:25.663
It's pretty much that simple.

52:26.831 --> 52:30.042
I mean, I don't hate the game. I admire
the amount of skill it involves.

52:30.126 --> 52:32.920
And-And like everyone else,
I was in awe of the way he played it.

52:33.004 --> 52:37.258
But football, in many ways,
is the opposite of what I do.

52:38.509 --> 52:41.012
You're rewarded the more
you punish your opponent.

52:41.095 --> 52:44.557
You know, it's too much about violence,
and I don't want violence in my life.

52:45.850 --> 52:49.520
It's not a thing many people
can understand, but-

52:49.604 --> 52:52.690
Anyway, fate stepped in
with that car accident...

52:52.773 --> 52:55.026
and took football out of the equation.

52:55.109 --> 52:58.029
And everyone lived happily ever after.

53:00.072 --> 53:01.699
Sort of.

53:01.782 --> 53:04.452
What part of David's body was injured?

53:06.329 --> 53:09.165
Who said my husband's name was David?

53:16.923 --> 53:18.925
Ladies and gentlemen-

53:30.645 --> 53:32.647
In the first half-

54:01.801 --> 54:04.345
A 737 crashes on takeoff-

54:04.428 --> 54:07.390
172 die, no survivors.

54:07.473 --> 54:11.852
A hotel fire downtown-
211 die, no survivors.

54:11.936 --> 54:15.898
An Eastrail train derails
71/2 miles outside the city-

54:15.982 --> 54:17.984
131 die...

54:18.067 --> 54:20.152
one survivor.

54:20.236 --> 54:22.530
He is unharmed.

54:22.613 --> 54:25.533
I've spoken with your husband
about his survival.

54:25.616 --> 54:28.452
I suggested a rather
unbelievable possibility.

54:28.536 --> 54:31.706
Since then, I've come to believe
that possibility...

54:31.789 --> 54:33.791
however unbelievable...

54:33.874 --> 54:36.335
is now more a probability.

54:36.419 --> 54:39.297
And what was it you suggested?

54:39.380 --> 54:42.091
These are mediocre times, Mrs Dunn.

54:42.174 --> 54:45.761
People are starting to lose hope.
It's hard for many to believe...

54:45.845 --> 54:49.890
there are extraordinary things
inside themselves as well as others.

54:49.974 --> 54:53.102
I hope you can keep an open mind.

55:35.102 --> 55:37.688
Excuse me, sir?

55:37.772 --> 55:40.191
Can you step out of line, please?

55:44.320 --> 55:48.282
We've been having some problems with
people selling drugs here in the stadium.

55:48.366 --> 55:50.826
Would you mind if I check your pockets?

55:51.953 --> 55:54.664
Raise your arms, please.

55:54.747 --> 55:56.749
Come on, raise them up.

55:56.832 --> 55:59.043
I just got here, man.

56:09.637 --> 56:11.681
Can I put my hands down now?

56:17.436 --> 56:19.438
Can I go?

56:20.564 --> 56:22.566
Yeah.

56:24.110 --> 56:26.112
Hope you find them.

56:35.371 --> 56:39.667
- Yo, Dunn.
- Yeah.

56:39.750 --> 56:42.795
I just came into the office.
Your kid was hurt.

56:44.046 --> 56:47.258
- Where is he?
- Some play rehearsal at school.

56:47.341 --> 56:49.594
He wants you to come down there.

57:04.066 --> 57:06.569
Is that your dad?

57:09.780 --> 57:12.950
I bet my dad could beat up your dad.

57:16.412 --> 57:19.582
No, he, uh, he insisted
we call only you...

57:19.665 --> 57:21.751
though we had some trouble
tracking you down.

57:21.834 --> 57:23.878
I mean, you're not on our list.

57:25.171 --> 57:26.756
Audrey handles this type of stuff.

57:26.839 --> 57:29.550
Oh. What type of stuff?

57:31.010 --> 57:33.012
Joseph stuff.

57:36.098 --> 57:38.517
Do I need to put any smelly ointment
on him or anything?

57:38.601 --> 57:40.603
No, no, it's more emotional damage.

57:40.686 --> 57:44.231
Not, uh- Not to serious, physically.

57:44.315 --> 57:47.818
Nothing like when I sent you
to the hospital.

57:51.781 --> 57:53.991
When was that?

57:54.075 --> 57:58.704
My office was on the other side
of the building back then.

58:01.165 --> 58:03.834
You don't remember me, do you?

58:05.878 --> 58:09.924
- No, ma'am.
- I had red hair.

58:12.176 --> 58:16.931
Well, you were a little younger
than Joseph when it happened.

58:17.014 --> 58:20.601
Did you know that we
changed the rules of conduct...

58:20.685 --> 58:23.479
around the pool because of you?

58:25.898 --> 58:27.900
The kids still tell about it...

58:27.984 --> 58:31.445
like it was some sort of ghost story.

58:31.529 --> 58:35.825
"Did you know there was a kid
nearly drowned in that pool?

58:37.118 --> 58:40.496
He lay on the bottom of the pool
for five minutes.

58:40.580 --> 58:44.792
And when they pulled him out,
he was dead."

58:49.422 --> 58:53.467
We let them tell it.
It helps keep them safe.

58:57.054 --> 58:59.599
You still phobic of water?

59:02.602 --> 59:04.645
It was Potter and another guy.

59:05.980 --> 59:09.942
They were messing with
this Chinese girl in the dressing room.

59:10.026 --> 59:13.362
Y- You can't let bad things
happen to good people, right?

59:14.488 --> 59:17.992
That's your code, right?
That's the hero's code.

59:19.493 --> 59:21.495
I tried to make them stop...

59:21.579 --> 59:25.666
but they kept pushing me down,
and they wouldn't let me get back up.

59:28.461 --> 59:31.297
I thought maybe 'cause you're my dad...

59:32.423 --> 59:34.759
I thought I might be like you.

59:38.346 --> 59:40.348
I'm not like you.

59:42.224 --> 59:45.436
You are like me.

59:45.519 --> 59:47.730
We can both get hurt.

59:49.065 --> 59:53.277
- I'm just an ordinary man.
- No, you're not.

59:53.361 --> 59:56.197
Why do you keep saying that?

01:00:03.913 --> 01:00:07.208
Elijah Price came to visit me
at the centre today.

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:11.212
Jesus.

01:00:11.295 --> 01:00:14.048
He didn't do anything. He just...

01:00:14.131 --> 01:00:16.133
told me his theory.

01:00:17.260 --> 01:00:19.929
That's sad when patients get like that.

01:00:20.012 --> 01:00:22.014
They lose reality.

01:00:26.978 --> 01:00:29.522
Joseph, what the hell are you doing?

01:00:29.605 --> 01:00:31.607
Oh, my God.

01:00:31.691 --> 01:00:35.486
You don't believe. I'll show you.
You can't get hurt.

01:00:35.569 --> 01:00:38.489
That gun's not loaded. He doesn't
know where I keep the bullets.

01:00:38.572 --> 01:00:41.617
In your Rookie of the Year trophy.

01:00:41.701 --> 01:00:44.495
Joseph, did you load the gun?

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:48.249
- You won't get hurt.
- Elijah was wrong.

01:00:48.332 --> 01:00:50.835
- When did he meet Elijah?
- He was with me when I met him.

01:00:50.918 --> 01:00:52.920
No one believes him.

01:00:53.004 --> 01:00:55.965
Joseph, listen to me.

01:00:56.048 --> 01:01:01.178
Sometimes when people get sick or hurt
for a long time, like Elijah...

01:01:01.262 --> 01:01:05.141
their mind gets hurt too, and they
start to think things that aren't true.

01:01:05.224 --> 01:01:09.020
He told me what he thought
about your father. It isn't true.

01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:11.105
I'll show you.

01:01:13.733 --> 01:01:17.778
Do you remember the story about the
- about the boy that almost drowned in the pool?

01:01:17.862 --> 01:01:20.531
That was me they were talking about.
I almost died. That was me.

01:01:20.615 --> 01:01:23.409
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying, okay? I just didn't remember it, that's all.

01:01:23.492 --> 01:01:25.661
Joseph, you know your father
was injured in college.

01:01:25.745 --> 01:01:28.581
You know that.
You know all about that.

01:01:29.707 --> 01:01:32.251
Don't do it.
He'll die, Joseph.

01:01:32.335 --> 01:01:36.839
- I'll just shoot him once.
- Joseph, listen to what your moth-

01:01:36.923 --> 01:01:38.925
Don't be scared.

01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:42.136
Joseph...

01:01:42.219 --> 01:01:44.764
if you pull that trigger,
I'm going to leave.

01:01:44.847 --> 01:01:48.225
Do you understand?
I'm going to go to New York.

01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:51.812
Y- Y-You're right.
If you pull that trigger...

01:01:51.896 --> 01:01:55.149
that bullet is just gonna bounce off me,
and I'm not going to be hurt.

01:01:55.232 --> 01:01:57.568
But then I'm going to go upstairs
and I'm gonna pack...

01:01:57.652 --> 01:02:00.863
and I'm going to leave for New York.

01:02:00.947 --> 01:02:05.868
- Why?
- Because I thought we were just starting to be friends for real.

01:02:05.952 --> 01:02:07.954
And friends'll listen to each other.
They don't-

01:02:08.037 --> 01:02:11.874
And-And they don't shoot each other,
uh, uh, do they, Audrey?

01:02:11.958 --> 01:02:15.002
N- No shooting friends, Joseph.

01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:17.546
Joseph!

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.758
You are about to be in big trouble!

01:02:21.884 --> 01:02:23.886
Now, I am your father,
and I am telling you...

01:02:23.970 --> 01:02:27.181
to put that goddamn gun down
right now!

01:02:27.265 --> 01:02:30.101
One, two-

01:02:49.036 --> 01:02:51.455
I followed the guy
in the camouflage jacket.

01:02:53.374 --> 01:02:58.796
He had a silver gun with a black grip
tucked in the back of his pants.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:03.843
Were you really injured
in that car accident in college?

01:03:03.926 --> 01:03:07.430
'Cause I believe you faked it.
I believe you took the opportunity...

01:03:07.513 --> 01:03:10.266
to end your football career,
no questions asked.

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:14.103
And I think you did it,
of all things, for a woman.

01:03:14.186 --> 01:03:16.188
I guess that makes sense.

01:03:16.272 --> 01:03:19.525
Football's what, just ten years?

01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:24.196
But love?
Hmm. Now, that's forever.

01:03:26.532 --> 01:03:29.744
And that little bit of sadness
in the mornings you spoke of?

01:03:29.827 --> 01:03:32.079
I think I know what that is.

01:03:32.163 --> 01:03:35.666
Perhaps you're not doing
what you're supposed to be doing.

01:03:35.750 --> 01:03:37.752
Most guns have a black
or silver handle.

01:03:37.835 --> 01:03:39.837
I had a 50-50 shot
of getting the colour right.

01:03:39.921 --> 01:03:43.049
- That's not what I witnessed.
- Stop.

01:03:43.132 --> 01:03:46.427
Stop messing with my life, Elijah.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:50.097
My son almost shot me last night because
he wanted to prove you were right.

01:03:50.181 --> 01:03:52.183
I never said you couldn't be killed.

01:03:52.266 --> 01:03:54.268
- I never said that.
- My wife was right.

01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:59.190
There have been three major disasters,
and you were the only one unharmed.

01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:01.275
I have been sick.

01:04:03.486 --> 01:04:08.199
When I was a kid, I spent a week in the
hospital getting better from pneumonia.

01:04:08.282 --> 01:04:12.036
I almost drowned.
Two skinny little kids...

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:15.623
were fooling around in a pool dunking me
and I swallowed some water.

01:04:15.706 --> 01:04:18.834
They didn't know it,
and it almost killed me.

01:04:18.918 --> 01:04:21.504
Heroes don't get killed like that.

01:04:21.587 --> 01:04:23.839
Normal people do, right?

01:04:25.424 --> 01:04:28.344
I don't need to see you any more, okay?

01:04:29.929 --> 01:04:32.431
Please stay away from my family.

01:04:41.107 --> 01:04:44.235
She said I could tell stories
that could make you cry

01:04:44.318 --> 01:04:46.362
What about you

01:04:46.445 --> 01:04:48.656
Hey, man, it's 20 after.
It's time to choose.

01:04:48.739 --> 01:04:50.741
I gotta head.

01:04:50.825 --> 01:04:55.037
And she sighed, ahh
I said, I want to be a singer

01:04:55.121 --> 01:04:58.541
You better not be jacking off to the
Japanese comics, I swear to God.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:03.546
Let's go, let's sit
Let's talk politics

01:05:03.629 --> 01:05:06.549
Goes so good with beer
And while we're at it, baby

01:05:06.632 --> 01:05:09.135
Why don't you tell me
one of your biggest fears

01:05:09.218 --> 01:05:12.346
I said, losing my penis
to a whore with disease

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:14.557
Uh, look, man, I didn't
know you were in a-

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:16.851
Losin'my life to
a whore with disease

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:19.895
- Just choose something, all right?
- Excuse me, please

01:05:24.817 --> 01:05:26.819
The baby-sitter's here.

01:05:29.739 --> 01:05:32.909
- Should we cancel?
- I'm fine.

01:05:35.912 --> 01:05:38.706
We can do this another time.

01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:40.791
Don't lie.

01:05:42.835 --> 01:05:45.504
I'm fine. I just got mixed up.

01:05:52.845 --> 01:05:55.514
How about we just go
for a couple drinks?

01:06:01.187 --> 01:06:03.940
Okay, look, man,
I'm-I'm just gonna wheel you out.

01:06:04.023 --> 01:06:06.025
All right? You can think about things
outside on the sidewalk.

01:06:06.108 --> 01:06:08.110
I gotta get some chicken in me,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:06:08.194 --> 01:06:11.364
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:06:11.447 --> 01:06:16.369
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

01:06:25.211 --> 01:06:28.506
- I told the tale of a girl
- Shit!

01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:30.841
She's a little bit older than me

01:06:30.925 --> 01:06:33.678
Strong legs, strong face
voice like milk

01:06:33.761 --> 01:06:35.763
Breasts like a cluster of grapes

01:06:35.846 --> 01:06:38.140
I can't escape her ways

01:06:38.224 --> 01:06:40.226
She raise me

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:48.526
- Dude.
- Even if you have no one

01:06:48.609 --> 01:06:50.653
Man, I don't care if you are in
a wheelchair. If you do that again...

01:06:50.736 --> 01:06:53.281
I'm calling 5-0.

01:06:53.364 --> 01:06:55.449
And while you're at it, baby

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:57.535
Man.

01:07:03.082 --> 01:07:07.712
You don't want to sleep
after setting my loins on fire

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:11.173
That's it, crackerjack. You're gonna
be sitting your ass in jail now.

01:07:11.257 --> 01:07:15.970
I've been tired, I've been tired
I've been tired

01:07:16.053 --> 01:07:19.599
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:07:29.317 --> 01:07:32.486
I've been tired, I've been tired

01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:35.740
- I've been tired, I've been tired
- How much for this one?

01:07:35.823 --> 01:07:37.325
I've been tired

01:07:38.784 --> 01:07:42.163
- Rust?
- Yeah.

01:07:42.246 --> 01:07:44.582
As a colour, not as rust.

01:07:44.665 --> 01:07:48.586
You know, like rust-coloured
paint or wood.

01:07:50.379 --> 01:07:53.674
- I didn't know that.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:53.758 --> 01:07:56.344
Mine's still brown.

01:07:56.427 --> 01:07:58.429
Okay, my turn.

01:07:58.512 --> 01:08:00.723
Favourite song?

01:08:00.806 --> 01:08:04.977
"Soft and Wet" by the Artist
Formerly Known as Prince.

01:08:05.061 --> 01:08:07.396
What?

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:10.232
We're supposed to be honest.

01:08:10.316 --> 01:08:12.735
"Soft And Wet."

01:08:12.818 --> 01:08:15.154
That's very interesting.

01:08:15.238 --> 01:08:17.240
Okay, my turn.

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:21.160
When was the first time...

01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:25.538
the thought popped into your head
we might not make it?

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:29.042
That's not the game.

01:08:29.126 --> 01:08:32.171
It's the first date.
There aren't any rules.

01:08:36.341 --> 01:08:39.886
- Don't know for sure.
- Think carefully.

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.182
What about the game?

01:08:43.265 --> 01:08:45.268
It's over. I won.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:49.272
Look, maybe it wasn't
a specific moment.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:54.109
- Maybe it was a time-
- I had a nightmare one night...

01:08:54.193 --> 01:09:00.032
and I didn't wake you up so you
could tell me that it was okay.

01:09:01.533 --> 01:09:03.911
I think that was the first time.

01:09:05.955 --> 01:09:07.957
Does that count?

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.502
That counts.

01:09:15.214 --> 01:09:19.093
Do you knowingly keep me
and Joseph at a distance?

01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:29.228
Yes.

01:09:29.312 --> 01:09:31.314
Why?

01:09:33.482 --> 01:09:35.484
I don't know.

01:09:39.988 --> 01:09:42.575
I just don't feel right, Audrey.

01:09:43.993 --> 01:09:46.370
Something's...

01:09:46.453 --> 01:09:48.663
just not right.

01:09:50.791 --> 01:09:53.961
Do you resent us, David?

01:09:54.045 --> 01:09:56.547
Resent the life you have?

01:09:58.466 --> 01:10:02.094
I mean, there were a lot of other things
you could've done after college.

01:10:02.178 --> 01:10:04.555
These were your choices.

01:10:09.226 --> 01:10:11.520
You know, even if it meant
we couldn't have been together...

01:10:11.604 --> 01:10:15.066
I never would've wished
that injury on you.

01:10:15.149 --> 01:10:17.610
What you could do physically...

01:10:17.693 --> 01:10:19.946
was a gift.

01:10:20.029 --> 01:10:22.823
I never would've wished it to go away.

01:10:25.034 --> 01:10:27.036
You know that, right?

01:10:31.249 --> 01:10:34.085
You had two calls after Joseph
went to bed. One came through...

01:10:34.168 --> 01:10:36.462
while I was on the other line,
but I wasn't talking too long.

01:10:36.545 --> 01:10:40.383
There was an emergency with my sister. She tried to do
her own perm, and now she looks like she stuck her head-

01:10:40.466 --> 01:10:42.593
Who called through?

01:10:42.677 --> 01:10:45.096
Um, someone from New York...

01:10:45.179 --> 01:10:47.223
uh, about a security job.

01:10:47.306 --> 01:10:50.518
They want to hire you. I didn't know
you guys were moving to New York.

01:10:50.601 --> 01:10:53.020
Thanks for telling me.

01:10:53.104 --> 01:10:55.690
We weren't all gonna move.

01:10:56.857 --> 01:10:58.859
Oh.

01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:04.115
I let the answering machine
pick up the other call.

01:11:08.244 --> 01:11:10.246
Great.

01:11:21.757 --> 01:11:25.553
Look, let's just be honest here.
We're just at the beginning...

01:11:25.636 --> 01:11:28.639
and I don't expect
you or I to change...

01:11:28.723 --> 01:11:31.183
the course of where
our lives were headed...

01:11:31.267 --> 01:11:33.561
because of one date.

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:38.107
And if you do go to New York,
we can develop this.

01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:41.360
We'll just be forced to take it slow.

01:11:41.444 --> 01:11:45.197
And in the end, I think
that's definitely better.

01:11:47.742 --> 01:11:50.036
I mean, this is our second time around,
David. I didn't expect us...

01:11:50.119 --> 01:11:52.413
to get carried away.

01:11:54.665 --> 01:11:58.544
But I guess "congratulations"
is the right thing to say.

01:12:23.319 --> 01:12:25.571
David, it's Elijah.

01:12:25.655 --> 01:12:27.657
It was so obvious.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:30.076
It was this one issue
that brought it back for me-

01:12:30.159 --> 01:12:32.161
Century Comics 117.

01:12:32.245 --> 01:12:34.372
That's where this group,
the Coalition of Evil...

01:12:34.455 --> 01:12:36.958
tried to ascertain the weakness
of every superhero...

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:40.461
because they all have one, just like you.

01:12:40.544 --> 01:12:44.590
Your bones don't break.
Mine do. That's clear.

01:12:44.674 --> 01:12:48.135
Your cells react to bacteria
and viruses differently than mine.

01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:52.181
You don't get sick.
I do. That's also clear.

01:12:52.265 --> 01:12:57.561
But for some reason, you and I
react the exact same way to water.

01:12:57.645 --> 01:13:00.064
We swallow it too fast, we choke.

01:13:00.147 --> 01:13:02.400
We get some in our lungs, we drown.

01:13:02.483 --> 01:13:07.572
However unreal it may seem,
we are connected, you and I.

01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:12.326
We're on the same curve,
just on opposite ends.

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:16.455
The point of all this is we
now know something we didn't.

01:13:16.539 --> 01:13:20.084
You have a weakness- water.

01:13:20.167 --> 01:13:23.129
It's like your kryptonite.

01:13:23.212 --> 01:13:25.506
You hearing me, David?

01:15:40.474 --> 01:15:42.476
Audrey?

01:16:15.885 --> 01:16:18.304
Gotcha. Come on.

01:16:35.905 --> 01:16:38.741
Audrey. Audrey.

01:16:44.622 --> 01:16:46.624
Hey!

01:16:50.711 --> 01:16:53.589
You'll be okay.

01:16:53.673 --> 01:16:57.468
What- What happened?

01:16:57.551 --> 01:17:01.472
I thought I was-
I thought I was dead.

01:17:01.555 --> 01:17:03.557
Me too.

01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:10.022
Is she all right?

01:17:10.106 --> 01:17:12.441
I think her leg's broken.

01:17:12.525 --> 01:17:15.069
Are you hurt?

01:17:15.152 --> 01:17:17.363
Hey, man, are you hurt?

01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:49.812
Hello.

01:17:49.895 --> 01:17:52.648
I wasn't injured in that car accident.

01:17:52.732 --> 01:17:55.359
David.

01:17:55.443 --> 01:17:57.987
I've never been injured, Elijah.

01:18:00.323 --> 01:18:02.617
What am I supposed to do?

01:18:08.581 --> 01:18:11.459
Go to where people are.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:14.545
You won't have to look very long.

01:18:16.172 --> 01:18:19.133
It's all right to be afraid, David...

01:18:19.216 --> 01:18:23.262
because this part won't be
like a comic book.

01:18:23.346 --> 01:18:28.225
Real life doesn't fit into little boxes
that were drawn for it.

01:19:06.555 --> 01:19:10.518
There's one in the first row.
It's- It's the second one.

01:19:10.601 --> 01:19:13.479
Yes. It's the second one over.

01:19:46.637 --> 01:19:48.806
Go back to Africa!

01:20:05.114 --> 01:20:07.366
Hey, what's your name?

01:20:12.997 --> 01:20:15.207
I think you drank too much.

01:21:00.836 --> 01:21:02.880
Can I come in?

01:21:02.964 --> 01:21:05.508
Who are you?

01:21:05.591 --> 01:21:08.386
I like your house.

01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:10.471
Can I come in?

01:21:10.554 --> 01:21:12.765
What is this?

01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:17.728
No, you can't come in.

01:21:17.812 --> 01:21:20.273
Are you sure?

01:21:20.356 --> 01:21:22.650
What are- What are you-

01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:54.839
It's okay.

01:26:05.182 --> 01:26:07.184
It's okay. It's okay.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:53.466
I had a bad dream.

01:32:59.347 --> 01:33:01.515
It's over now.

01:33:29.502 --> 01:33:32.338
I don't know.

01:33:32.421 --> 01:33:34.507
I can't believe you'd think that.

01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:36.592
I'm just asking you.

01:33:39.845 --> 01:33:42.056
I'm making French toast.

01:33:57.488 --> 01:34:00.074
I've been thinking about Elijah Price.

01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:05.162
If he shows up again, I think
we should call the police, okay?

01:34:09.250 --> 01:34:11.252
Okay?

01:34:13.754 --> 01:34:15.756
Okay.

01:35:23.866 --> 01:35:25.952
You were right.

01:36:15.543 --> 01:36:19.630
This is one of Johann Davis'
earliest drawings.

01:36:19.714 --> 01:36:22.091
See the villain's eyes?

01:36:22.174 --> 01:36:24.427
They're larger than
the other characters'.

01:36:24.510 --> 01:36:30.016
They insinuate a slightly skewed
perspective on how they see the world-

01:36:31.142 --> 01:36:33.436
just off normal.

01:36:33.519 --> 01:36:35.855
He doesn't look scary.

01:36:35.938 --> 01:36:38.441
Mm-hmm. That's what I said to my son.

01:36:38.524 --> 01:36:41.193
But he says there's always two kinds.

01:36:41.277 --> 01:36:45.698
There's the soldier villain
who fights the hero with his hands...

01:36:45.781 --> 01:36:50.077
and then there's the real threat-
the brilliant and evil archenemy...

01:36:50.161 --> 01:36:52.663
who fights the hero with his mind.

01:36:52.747 --> 01:36:54.749
Are you Elijah's mother?

01:36:54.832 --> 01:36:58.586
I am. I'm helping him with the sale.

01:36:58.669 --> 01:37:01.464
Nice to meet you. I'm David Dunn.

01:37:01.547 --> 01:37:03.549
He's spoken of you.

01:37:03.633 --> 01:37:05.635
Says you're becoming friends.

01:37:05.718 --> 01:37:08.137
We are.

01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.431
Looks like he's doing good today.

01:37:11.557 --> 01:37:14.477
I'm very proud of him.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.647
He's come through a lot in his life-

01:37:17.730 --> 01:37:21.275
a couple of bad spills
I thought had broken him.

01:37:21.359 --> 01:37:24.487
Mm-hmm. They were bad...

01:37:25.613 --> 01:37:28.157
but he made it.

01:37:28.241 --> 01:37:30.243
Yes, he did.

01:37:31.369 --> 01:37:33.579
He's kind of a miracle.

01:37:35.748 --> 01:37:37.750
Yes, he is.

01:37:41.295 --> 01:37:43.965
- I'll tell him you're here.
- Thank you.

01:37:45.299 --> 01:37:49.053
We'll work something out.
Always able to work something out.

01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:16.122
It has begun.

01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:21.377
Tell me something, David.

01:38:22.503 --> 01:38:27.049
When you woke up this morning,
was it still there?

01:38:27.133 --> 01:38:30.011
The sadness?

01:38:30.094 --> 01:38:32.096
No.

01:38:35.683 --> 01:38:38.728
I think this is where we shake hands.

01:38:57.747 --> 01:39:00.791
- Look!
- Did you see it?

01:39:10.176 --> 01:39:12.678
I worked in that building 25 years.

01:39:12.762 --> 01:39:14.889
I know all its secrets.

01:39:16.349 --> 01:39:18.351
Secrets?

01:39:19.769 --> 01:39:24.690
Like if there ever was a fire
on floors one, two or three...

01:39:24.774 --> 01:39:28.277
everyone in that hotel
would be burned alive.

01:39:34.242 --> 01:39:36.994
Passengers aren't allowed in there.

01:40:20.288 --> 01:40:22.748
Do you know what
the scariest thing is?

01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:29.755
To not know your place
in this world...

01:40:29.839 --> 01:40:32.383
to not know why you're here.

01:40:33.676 --> 01:40:35.678
That's-

01:40:37.513 --> 01:40:39.932
That's just an awful feeling.

01:40:41.309 --> 01:40:43.644
What have you done?

01:40:44.812 --> 01:40:47.857
I almost gave up hope.

01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:51.152
There were so many times
I questioned myself.

01:40:51.235 --> 01:40:53.779
You killed all those people.

01:40:55.072 --> 01:40:57.909
But I found you.

01:40:57.992 --> 01:41:01.287
So many sacrifices...

01:41:02.413 --> 01:41:04.415
just to find you.

01:41:04.498 --> 01:41:06.500
Jesus Christ!

01:41:16.385 --> 01:41:19.180
Now that we know who you are...

01:41:20.306 --> 01:41:23.017
I know who I am.

01:41:26.604 --> 01:41:28.814
I'm not a mistake.

01:41:30.316 --> 01:41:32.485
It all makes sense.

01:41:32.568 --> 01:41:37.156
In a comic, you know how you can tell
who the arch-villain's going to be?

01:41:37.240 --> 01:41:40.618
He's the exact opposite of the hero.

01:41:40.701 --> 01:41:44.455
And most times, they're friends,
like you and me.

01:41:44.538 --> 01:41:48.376
I should've known way back when.
You know why, David?

01:41:48.459 --> 01:41:50.461
Because of the kids.

01:42:00.388 --> 01:42:03.057
They called me Mr Glass.

01:42:04.305 --> 01:42:10.932
