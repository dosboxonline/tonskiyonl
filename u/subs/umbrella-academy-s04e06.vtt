Both of you. I need you to listen to me.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.740

18:37.866 --> 18:40.744
Surely he would've called, left a message.

Well, not entirely.

It turns out Gene and Jean also have
a bigger movement than we thought.

So we have to get to Ben and Jennifer
before they do and stop the Cleanse.

Right, but we have to find them first.

45:30.144 --> 45:33.439
Sorry. I need to get back to my family.
Stop this from ever happening.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.774
Well, good luck with that.

45:35.858 --> 45:38.235
Guess you don't want your brisket to go?

45:38.318 --> 45:40.070
[enigmatic music swells]

45:40.154 --> 45:42.322
[The Cleanse bellowing]

45:50.497 --> 45:52.458
Thank God. Hello.

45:52.541 --> 45:53.709
[Claire] Mom!

45:53.792 --> 45:55.627
[Allison] I'm okay. Go with your cousins.

45:55.711 --> 45:57.629
-No. I'm not leaving you.
-Claire, please.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.714
Come on. Let's go.

45:58.797 --> 46:00.424
Claire? We'll take care of her.

46:00.507 --> 46:03.677
Just can you and the others
just stay here, okay?

46:04.428 --> 46:06.138
Just one second. One second.

46:06.221 --> 46:07.848
[overlapping confused chatter]

46:08.515 --> 46:09.975
All right, on the couch.

46:10.058 --> 46:13.771
[Diego] How do we beat a thing
that everything we throw at it, it gets…

46:13.854 --> 46:16.273
it gets bigger and it gets stronger?

46:16.356 --> 46:17.274
Well, we can't.

46:17.357 --> 46:19.693
It's only a matter of time
before it envelops everything.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.779
So the world's ending again, huh?

46:21.862 --> 46:24.782
[Klaus] Hey! Great timing. Great timing.

46:24.865 --> 46:25.866
Hey.

46:26.575 --> 46:28.118
-Five.
-[Klaus] Five!

46:28.744 --> 46:31.580
Why'd you come back, buddy?
Things are pretty bleak here.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.624
Trust me. I wasn't planning on it.

46:34.708 --> 46:39.588
Fortunately, I had a, uh, long
and eye-opening conversation with myself.

46:40.714 --> 46:41.548
What?

46:41.632 --> 46:44.468
We are the reason that this is happening.

46:46.428 --> 46:47.805
You care to elaborate?

46:48.639 --> 46:52.851
The marigold that infected our mothers,
bringing forth our births…

46:52.935 --> 46:54.853
[poignant music playing]

46:54.937 --> 46:57.064
[Five] …had an unexpected side effect.

46:58.148 --> 46:59.817
It shattered the timeline,

47:00.692 --> 47:04.738
and it broke it into an infinite number
of alternate timelines.

47:05.405 --> 47:07.699
The timelines are bleeding
into each other.

47:07.783 --> 47:10.369
That's how the Keepers were able
to find those artifacts.

47:10.452 --> 47:12.913
Holy shit. Gene and Jean were right.

47:12.996 --> 47:15.499
Their dreams of other timelines were real.

47:15.999 --> 47:18.836
[Five] So we need to go back
to the original timeline

47:18.919 --> 47:20.838
before the other ones were created.

47:20.921 --> 47:24.299
Am I the only one
who's very, very, very confused?

47:24.383 --> 47:25.259
Nope.

47:25.342 --> 47:27.261
That's what Ben was trying to show me.

47:28.762 --> 47:30.556
What does Ben have to do with this?

47:30.639 --> 47:31.974
Back at the department store,

47:32.057 --> 47:35.727
when I was trying to pull the durango
from his body, I had a vision.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.735
I think he was trying to show me
the original timeline.

47:44.403 --> 47:45.821
He tried to kill you.

47:45.904 --> 47:48.490
But he didn't.
He pushed me away to save me.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.369
I think he was trying
to tell me something.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.371
That the Cleanse isn't a bad thing.

47:54.454 --> 47:56.915
[Luther scoffs] You're saying that thing

47:56.999 --> 48:00.043
that destroys everything
it comes into contact with is good?

48:00.127 --> 48:01.420
I think so? I…

48:01.503 --> 48:05.340
We need to let the marigold in our bodies
merge with the durango inside the Cleanse.

48:07.009 --> 48:08.927
They should cancel each other out.

48:09.970 --> 48:11.805
Okay. Then what happens to us?

48:13.265 --> 48:14.683
We cease to exist.

48:17.102 --> 48:18.145
[Klaus sputtering]

48:18.228 --> 48:22.566
Old Klaus might have been down
for some recreational hara-kiri,

48:22.649 --> 48:26.528
but it turns out
that I'm really not into killing myself,

48:26.612 --> 48:28.614
so, uh, count me out.

48:28.697 --> 48:32.117
Actually, it's not killing ourselves.
It's worse than that.

48:32.701 --> 48:34.202
We'll be erased from history.

48:37.623 --> 48:39.583
Okay, what about the other timelines?

48:40.542 --> 48:43.712
They will never have existed.
None of us will.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.591
No one will have
any memory of this… or us.

48:49.676 --> 48:51.511
[bittersweet, wistful music playing]

48:56.850 --> 48:58.977
Does anyone else not like this plan?

49:01.980 --> 49:04.942
If we cease to exist,
what happens to our families?

49:06.234 --> 49:07.402
I'm not sure.

49:07.486 --> 49:10.447
Wait. No, I… I don't like
where this is going, Five.

49:11.323 --> 49:13.533
Come on, Five.
There has to be another way.

49:13.617 --> 49:14.910
There isn't.

49:16.161 --> 49:17.913
[Klaus] Take it easy, all right?

49:18.622 --> 49:22.626
Lila, why don't you take the family
to that crazy subway of yours.

49:22.709 --> 49:25.629
You save them… save yourself.

49:25.712 --> 49:28.548
-No, she can't do that.
-I'm not talking to you, Five.

49:28.632 --> 49:31.093
All the marigold
needs to be destroyed, Diego.

49:31.176 --> 49:34.388
If Lila isn't here when the Cleanse comes,
it just restarts.

49:39.226 --> 49:41.520
Yeah, well, good thing
it's her decision, isn't it?

49:42.813 --> 49:43.689
Yeah.

49:49.069 --> 49:50.487
I'm staying with my mom.

49:51.822 --> 49:52.656
Claire Bear.

49:52.739 --> 49:53.949
-No.
-Mom, I'm staying.

49:54.032 --> 49:56.118
No. You have to go with Lila, okay?

49:56.201 --> 49:59.287
No. I'd rather die here with you
than not remember you.

49:59.371 --> 50:00.288
No.

50:01.289 --> 50:02.207
Claire.

50:03.959 --> 50:06.837
I need you to live… okay?

50:07.587 --> 50:10.007
I need you to live and experience

50:10.507 --> 50:13.885
all of the amazing things
that this world has to offer you, okay?

50:14.886 --> 50:16.513
-I'll forget you, Mom.
-No.

50:16.596 --> 50:18.015
We don't know that.

50:19.516 --> 50:20.851
Okay? We don't know that.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.061
What I do know is
you have to go with Lila.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.604
No, I can't.

50:24.688 --> 50:29.526
Hey, listen to Mom, Claire Bear.
Every time I do, things turn out okay.

50:29.609 --> 50:30.986
Hey, look at me.

50:31.778 --> 50:32.612
Look at me.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.745
I will always be a part of you.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.039
Always.

50:42.831 --> 50:44.207
Even if you don't remember me.

50:45.584 --> 50:51.673
You'll always be my beautiful, smart girl.

50:54.926 --> 50:55.886
Okay?

50:55.969 --> 50:57.971
[delicate, aching music playing]

51:05.645 --> 51:07.731
[shakily] Come here. I love you.

51:07.814 --> 51:08.940
[Claire] Love you too.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.234
[Claire weeping]

51:13.278 --> 51:15.363
-Okay.
-[Allison] You have to go.

51:15.447 --> 51:18.241
-[Claire] No. No.
-[Allison] Baby, you have to go.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.285
Let's go. Get the family together, okay?

51:20.368 --> 51:21.411
Lila, Lila, wait.

51:22.245 --> 51:24.414
Look, I don't wanna sound like
an asshole here,

51:25.874 --> 51:28.335
but if Five is right,
you leaving is not a good thing.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.045
He's right. You can't go.

51:35.759 --> 51:36.760
[stifled sobbing]

51:40.514 --> 51:42.724
-Watch me.
-[Luther] Lila!

51:43.350 --> 51:44.976
[Lila] Okay. Come on, everyone.

51:45.977 --> 51:48.230
Stand around me, okay?

51:52.651 --> 51:53.944
Lila, don't do this.

51:54.736 --> 51:55.779
Hold onto me.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.870

[in Punjabi] Where are we going?

52:14.005 --> 52:16.550
[replies in Punjabi, then English]
I'll tell you when we get there.

52:16.633 --> 52:17.759
Where are we going?

Somewhere safe, angel, okay?

-[Five] Lila.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.352
[family member 2] What's he doing here?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.855
Can you just keep everyone together?

52:32.190 --> 52:34.651
-[Lila] Don't try to stop me.
-Lila, please.

52:34.734 --> 52:37.070
I can't leave them.
What if they don't make it?

52:37.154 --> 52:38.363
Then they don't make it.

52:38.446 --> 52:39.447
[subway approaching]

52:43.243 --> 52:46.329
If you go with them,
then this whole thing starts over.

52:46.413 --> 52:49.166
It doesn't end until
all the marigold inside us is gone.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.169
You don't know that.

52:53.545 --> 52:54.629
Yeah, I do.

52:55.922 --> 52:57.048
You do too.

52:59.801 --> 53:01.344
You have to let them go.

53:04.890 --> 53:07.851
[in Punjabi] Lila, the train is here!
What should we do?

53:10.061 --> 53:12.063
[wrenching, distraught music playing]

53:13.523 --> 53:14.566
I'm sorry.

53:17.694 --> 53:20.614
Okay, come on. Come on, everyone.
What are you waiting for?

53:21.865 --> 53:23.200
Come on, come on, come on!

I'll see you soon, okay?

53:54.856 --> 53:56.566

53:56.650 --> 53:58.985
Make sure you read
to Gracie every night, okay?

[urgent, sweeping music playing]

54:09.371 --> 54:11.998
It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay.

It's gonna be okay.

54:22.842 --> 54:24.844
[bittersweet, resigned music playing]

54:29.307 --> 54:30.684
I hate you for this. [sobs]

54:30.767 --> 54:31.810
I know.

54:31.893 --> 54:34.771
I hate you. I hate you for this.

54:45.365 --> 54:48.410
[Luther] So, uh… now what?

54:49.661 --> 54:51.204
[Viktor] Guess we just wait.

54:53.832 --> 54:54.666
I'm sorry, guys.

54:54.749 --> 54:57.711
If I'd have known we were gonna die here,
I would have cleaned up.

54:57.794 --> 55:00.088
Well, at least your laundry's clean.
I mean…

55:00.171 --> 55:01.172
Actually, it's not.

[shrill shrieking]

55:17.230 --> 55:18.690
[Klaus] It looks angry.

55:19.190 --> 55:20.942
What gives you that impression?

55:21.026 --> 55:22.027
[chuckles dryly]

55:30.452 --> 55:31.286
The kids?

55:32.329 --> 55:33.496
Yeah, they're safe.

55:38.918 --> 55:39.753
And Claire.

55:41.963 --> 55:43.590
Think they're gonna be okay?

55:45.216 --> 55:46.092
Yeah.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.511
My family will take care of them.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.974
She'll never be alone.

55:59.981 --> 56:00.940
So…

56:07.447 --> 56:08.823
we gonna do this thing?

56:30.470 --> 56:32.305
All right. Moving!

56:32.389 --> 56:33.264
Come on. Let's go.

[Klaus] Quickly.

56:38.937 --> 56:40.397
[guttural bellowing]

56:44.818 --> 56:47.070
[Klaus] Oh God, I loved those windows.

56:49.614 --> 56:51.741
-All right.
-Doesn't matter anymore.

56:52.450 --> 56:55.328
Well, maybe we should go around the circle

56:55.412 --> 56:56.663
and, you know,

56:57.831 --> 57:00.250
share our favorite moments together.

57:03.461 --> 57:04.546
What?

57:04.629 --> 57:05.463
Barf.

57:05.547 --> 57:07.090
-Let's not do that.
-That's a bad idea.

57:07.173 --> 57:08.967
-Yeah, it's terrible.
-That's a terrible idea.

57:09.050 --> 57:10.385
Yeah, bad call.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.973
Okay, so… what do we do?

57:16.516 --> 57:18.476
Just power up, I guess.

57:23.064 --> 57:24.566
You feel strong enough for this?

57:25.525 --> 57:26.401
Yeah.

57:27.068 --> 57:28.111
I think so.

57:39.873 --> 57:41.583
Ugh, I'm feeling…

57:53.094 --> 57:54.179
[Diego] Okay.

57:55.430 --> 57:56.598
Now what?

57:57.182 --> 57:58.266
Now we wait.

58:26.544 --> 58:28.379
I'm sorry you left Canada for this.

58:29.506 --> 58:30.590
I'm not.

58:32.383 --> 58:34.344
This is where I'm supposed to be…

58:37.180 --> 58:38.223
with my family.

58:44.145 --> 58:45.230
You were right.

58:48.983 --> 58:49.943
Don't.

58:51.402 --> 58:52.403
I see you.

58:54.364 --> 58:55.573
I finally see you.

58:58.284 --> 58:59.911
I didn't mean to hurt you.

59:02.622 --> 59:03.665
I know.

59:48.334 --> 59:52.380
Don't fight it.
Let it take you. Just let it go.

59:53.673 --> 59:55.091
Whoo! It stings.

59:55.174 --> 59:56.009
[Luther] Yeah.

59:57.844 --> 59:59.345
I know. Right, buddy?

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.015
Hold on, okay?
