The sun is shining.

03:42.874 --> 03:46.400
Everybody'’s out there
having fun, socializing.

03:46.574 --> 03:50.839
Yeah, makes you wanna
get out there
and join '’em, doesn'’t it?

03:51.013 --> 03:52.449
It sure does.

03:52.623 --> 03:54.016
Uh-huh.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.757
- Well, I'’ll see ya.
- Hooray!

04:00.022 --> 04:02.329
Armen, what are you doing?

04:02.503 --> 04:03.765
Just a little
spring-cleaning.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.984
Come on.
We did spring.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.379
Oh, no, not this spring.
No, no. Next spring.
You know, it keeps recurring.

04:09.553 --> 04:11.207
You know,
I just like to get an early--

04:11.381 --> 04:13.427
Hey, wait. Anemone.
Give it back.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.342
I can'’t do that, man.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.170
For somethin'’ so tiny,
you really take up
a lot of space.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.651
Hey. Wait.
Was that necessary?

04:20.825 --> 04:24.133
If I had known my roommate
was gonna be
such a stick-in-the-mud,

04:24.307 --> 04:25.874
I never would have moved in.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.746
What are you talking about?
We'’re thriving in here.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.444
I got my bonsai going.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.097
- Armen.
- Shh.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.927
Perfect.
You learned a new language, right?

04:37.712 --> 04:39.583
I picked up a new instrument.

04:39.757 --> 04:41.106
Put it down!

04:41.281 --> 04:42.717
You wanna play
rock paper scissors again?

04:42.891 --> 04:45.023
Come on. Rock, pa--That'’s enough already!

04:45.197 --> 04:48.113
Come on, Armen.
It'’s time to face the music.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.290
You just gotta put
yourself out there.

04:50.464 --> 04:53.423
I want to, Anemone.
Believe me.

04:53.597 --> 04:55.860
But I'’m not like
these other crabs,
all right?

04:56.034 --> 04:57.645
I don'’t throw
my claws in the air.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.211
I don'’t wave '’em
like I just don'’t care.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.649
Because I care. Very much.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.173
Yo, Armen!
Hey, what are you doing?

05:04.347 --> 05:06.001
- Where you been?
- Get outta here.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.918
Good luck, boys.
I'’m tapping out.

05:10.092 --> 05:12.790
Hey, Bobby.
How'’s it going, you guys?

05:12.964 --> 05:14.314
What up, bro?

05:14.488 --> 05:17.317
He looks so pale.
Get this crab some vitamin D.

05:17.491 --> 05:18.883
Let'’s get to work, bro.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.494
Ready to tear it up
this summer or what?

05:22.191 --> 05:23.758
It'’s, like, 9:00 in the morning,
but, yeah.

05:23.932 --> 05:26.064
You coming to the club tonight,
Armen? Don'’t say no.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.240
Oh, we gotta get in that club.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.113
What'’s the point of working out
if I can'’t show off
the Condition?

05:31.287 --> 05:32.723
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
The "Condition"?

05:32.897 --> 05:34.899
What is that? Like a rash?

05:35.073 --> 05:37.206
Pfft. No.
It'’s my new nickname. Huh.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.382
Look at them go.
They got a mind of their own.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.863
Look at '’em.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

05:42.037 --> 05:44.169
I don'’t even want any critiques.
I'’m the Condition.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.650
Maybe you should see a doctor
about that, Jimmy?

05:48.391 --> 05:49.566
Oh, come on.
It'’s a great nickname.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.394
It'’s gonna stick,
I'’m telling ya.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.918
Hey,
so you coming to the club
with us or what?

05:54.092 --> 05:56.486
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe I better sit this one out.

05:56.660 --> 05:58.836
Give the rest of you guys
a chance, huh? [chuckles] Oh!

05:59.010 --> 06:02.623
Hey, come on.
I can'’t kick off summer
without my best friend.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.364
It'’s the Jersey Shore, baby!

06:05.626 --> 06:08.890
Oh, geez louise. Sea crabs.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.022
There'’s gotta be twice as many
as last summer.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.982
It'’s not fair.
They got the whole ocean.

06:14.156 --> 06:15.766
Unlimited shells.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.681
All the riches of the sea.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.683
They can go
wherever they want.

06:19.857 --> 06:22.033
Why do they gotta come
to our town?

06:22.207 --> 06:25.123
I'’m just throwing it out there,
but aren'’t you all hermit crabs?

06:25.297 --> 06:28.605
I mean, you'’re crabs.
They'’re crabs.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.694
Maybe you got more in common
than you think?

06:31.260 --> 06:32.217
Oh!

06:32.392 --> 06:33.654
- This guy.
- That is blasphemy.

06:33.828 --> 06:36.221
Are you kidding me?
We got nothing in common.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.267
We live on land.
They live in the sea.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.051
They stay out of
the water too long...

06:42.010 --> 06:45.100
I don'’t feel so good.[gasps] Oh, my gosh.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.716
I rest my case.
They'’re imitation crabs.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.065
Namaste.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.374
What'’d he call me?

06:58.548 --> 06:59.549
Didn'’t you read the sign?

06:59.723 --> 07:01.377
Locals only.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.074
Namaste! Namaste!

07:03.248 --> 07:04.772
Take a walk, pal.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.209
I think it'’s time to start
cracking some shells.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.517
What the--

07:13.955 --> 07:15.957
Holy Bon Jovi.

07:16.131 --> 07:18.786
Bobby, this shell
was made for you, bro.

07:18.960 --> 07:21.615
XXL. Sleek, yet spacious.

07:21.789 --> 07:23.834
Maybe throw a spoiler on it?

07:24.008 --> 07:26.663
Oh, couple of jell-EDs
for that underglow.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.186
Save up for hydraulics.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.319
That'’s cool.
It is cool. It is.

07:30.493 --> 07:33.235
Why don'’t you take a test walk,
- Bobby?
- Yeah, baby.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.063
- You know what that means.
- Oh, no.

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
Vacancy chain!

07:37.369 --> 07:38.719
- Vacancy chain?
- Vacancy chain!

07:38.893 --> 07:40.155
Vacancy chain!

07:40.329 --> 07:41.635
- I saved you a spot, bro.
- What?

07:41.809 --> 07:43.680
You didn'’t have to do that.

07:43.854 --> 07:46.553
All right.
Who'’s ready to move up a size?

07:46.727 --> 07:48.250
Yeah![crab] Oh, yeah!

07:48.424 --> 07:51.514
Step one.
Grab on to your future shell.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.168
Grab on, bro.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.475
Hey. Morning.
Lot of eagerness.
Wow, great energy.

07:55.649 --> 07:58.869
Step two.
Remove your future shell.

07:59.043 --> 08:01.655
Uh, actually, this one
might be a better fit for you.

08:01.829 --> 08:05.528
- Oh!
- Step three. Move in, baby!

08:05.702 --> 08:08.009
The Condish just got an upgrade.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.665
Yeah, I'’m gonna do
some damage in this.

08:11.839 --> 08:14.189
Come on, Jimmy. You wanna
spar with me? You'’re flinching.
You'’re flinching.

08:14.363 --> 08:16.539
Yeah, this is nice.
Bit tight for me, though.
Moving on.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.323
Look at all these happy faces.
Keep it moving.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.977
Never wipe that smile
off your face... Oh!

08:20.151 --> 08:21.413
...promise me.
You look amazing.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.937
That went well,
don'’t you think?

08:23.111 --> 08:26.506
Come on, Armen.
That'’s all you.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.073
Uh, you know,
it'’s a little
ostentatious for me,

08:29.247 --> 08:31.380
and I can'’t--
I can'’t leave Anemone.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.165
What?
No, we have lived together
long enough.

08:34.339 --> 08:37.647
Will I be sad?
Yes, I will miss you.
But I will get over it.

08:37.821 --> 08:39.257
You go on. Get in there!

08:39.431 --> 08:40.824
Armen, come on.
You can do it. Get in.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.391
Just take it.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.219
-  Armen!
- Hey, guys, thanks for the offer.

08:44.393 --> 08:46.438
Give it to someone who needs it.
Don'’t waste it on me.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.615
Aw.[sighs] Every time.

08:48.789 --> 08:50.704
I don'’t get it.
That shell was butter.

08:50.878 --> 08:52.619
Hey, come on.
Cut him some slack.

08:52.793 --> 08:55.230
And after everything
he'’s been through...

08:57.362 --> 08:59.713
Hey, hold-- hold up, Armen.
Armen, hold up.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.976
You all right?

09:02.150 --> 09:04.413
You know, my parents
gave me this shell.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.328
It'’s, like,
all I have left of them.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.199
I know, buddy. I know.

09:08.373 --> 09:09.723
Hey, come on, Armen.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.376
You'’re just in a rut.
That'’s all.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.205
You gotta get out of your shell,
buddy. Take a risk.

09:14.379 --> 09:16.904
- Get the blood pumping.
- Yeah, you should pick a fight!

09:17.078 --> 09:20.037
Yo, you wanna start, bro?
You wanna start?

09:21.909 --> 09:24.607
- See?
- Yeah, you should talk
to a girl.

09:24.781 --> 09:27.305
- How'’s it going, Denise?
- Drop dead.

09:27.479 --> 09:29.133
See? Just feels good.

09:29.307 --> 09:31.483
Just come to the club tonight,
- okay?
- Why?

09:31.658 --> 09:34.661
So I can stand in the corner
and watch you hit on girls
and get in fights?

09:34.835 --> 09:36.793
- Yeah!
- No, forget it, Bobby.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.839
I can'’t do it again this summer,
all right?

09:39.013 --> 09:42.407
I'’m just gonna punch the clock.
Get in. Get out.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.366
Order up.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.237
- I don'’t want any trouble.
- Since when do I
get us in trouble?

09:46.411 --> 09:49.197
Bobby Marinara,
this ain'’t your personal buffet!

09:49.371 --> 09:54.028
[sighs] All right, listen up.
All of youse.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.203
Everybody settle down!

09:55.377 --> 09:57.248
Order up.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.120
Not that kind of bell.
That'’s a manager bell.
It'’s my bell.

10:00.643 --> 10:01.905
As I was saying--

10:02.079 --> 10:03.341
Seriously?

10:03.515 --> 10:05.648
What? I slipped.
You try wearing these heels.

10:05.822 --> 10:09.870
Oh, show some respect.
He'’s our manager.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.654
Continue, sir.

10:11.828 --> 10:14.744
Thank you so much
for your permission.
Now, where was I?

10:14.918 --> 10:15.832
- Achoo!
- Bobby!

10:16.006 --> 10:17.355
Sorry, allergies.

10:17.529 --> 10:18.835
I get '’em every summer.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.886
Next one who rings my bell
is fired. You hear me?

10:26.060 --> 10:29.237
Now do not forget
you are the help.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.152
They are the guests.

10:31.326 --> 10:35.939
They can be rude, condescending,
call you names, ignore you.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.725
And guess what? I don'’t care!

10:38.899 --> 10:41.771
And we do not spit
in their food, Jimmy Romaine.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.123
Just get to work,
you numbskulls.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.690
Get out!

10:47.864 --> 10:49.083
Well!

10:49.257 --> 10:50.780
This isn'’t the only resort,
you know?

10:50.954 --> 10:52.826
I can give you three nights free
if you stay for a week.

10:53.000 --> 10:54.784
Sir? Come back!

10:56.830 --> 11:00.442
To day one, Armen.
A fresh start.
Anything could happen.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.444
Who knows?
You might even fall in love.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.620
Yeah, right.
Like that'’ll ever happen.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.711
We'’re almost there.

11:09.451 --> 11:10.800
Oh, finally.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.368
I can see the surface.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.460
Girls, now stay close.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.288
Yeah, stay close, Shelly.

11:20.462 --> 11:21.898
Race you to the top.
Let'’s go!

11:23.465 --> 11:25.467
Oh, these girls are gonna be
the end of me.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.785
Whoo! Oh, that feels so good.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.787
Shelly.

11:41.439 --> 11:42.571
Wow.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.102
Whoa!

11:54.496 --> 11:56.324
Dry sand.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.978
Oh, you gonna pay for that.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.418
You mind?
Hey, I'’m walking here.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.376
- Hey.
- Hey, hey!

12:05.986 --> 12:07.552
Just go around.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.293
What'’s the matter?
Is she deaf?

12:11.687 --> 12:13.558
Yes, she is.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.996
- Huh?
- Hey, how was I
supposed to know?

12:16.170 --> 12:17.084
Yeah.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.955
Land crabs.

12:19.129 --> 12:21.262
Girls! What are you doing?

12:21.436 --> 12:22.959
Come on, Mom.

12:23.133 --> 12:24.700
Can'’t we just explore
a little before we check in?

12:24.874 --> 12:28.748
You know the rules, Ramona.
We do not go past the wet sand.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.753
Now can we please
get to the resort?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.755
Honey,
Mama needs a cocktail.

12:41.282 --> 12:42.936
Whoo-hoo!

12:46.983 --> 12:49.246
Care for a spritz?
All right, you'’re welcome.

12:49.420 --> 12:51.074
Oh, yes,
and one for you too.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.250
And you'’re welcome.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.470
Ah. I can see it in your eyes.
You want to-- Here you go.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.385
Don'’t mention it.
Not that you were going to.

12:59.300 --> 13:02.303
Hey, no running.
And stay hydrated.

13:02.477 --> 13:03.957
Oh, you were right, Camille.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.350
This place is exactly
what I needed.

13:06.524 --> 13:10.354
Right. Land views?
Spa days for the mums?

13:10.528 --> 13:11.921
Ron'’s at the Clams Casino.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.880
I won'’t have to see him
for a week.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.971
So how are things, Val?

13:18.145 --> 13:22.453
Really, I don'’t know
how you do it, adopting
two girls on your own.

13:22.627 --> 13:23.759
Oh, they'’re great.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.152
Shelly'’s at the top
of her class,

13:25.326 --> 13:27.719
and Ramona,
she got early admission to Kale.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.547
Oh, Mako got into Kale.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.375
Well, it'’s between
Kale and Prawn.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.203
Mako!

13:33.377 --> 13:35.815
Oh, hello, Mum.
Didn'’t see you there.

13:35.989 --> 13:38.643
Nigel, Chauncey, see you
for more fun and games later.

13:38.818 --> 13:42.038
- How was the game? Who won?
- Oh, Mum, you know
I don'’t keep score.

13:42.212 --> 13:45.346
I'’m just playing
for my personal best
and sheer narcissism these days.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.652
You remember my friend Val?

13:47.827 --> 13:49.698
How lovely to see you.
Oh!

13:49.872 --> 13:52.483
I thought Mako and Ramona
might get along.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.442
- Where is Ramona?
- Oh.

13:54.616 --> 13:56.923
They were just here
a minute ago.

13:57.097 --> 13:59.969
Stop. Okay, okay.

14:00.143 --> 14:01.536
On the count of three.

14:02.015 --> 14:03.712
One, two--

14:03.886 --> 14:05.105
- Hey! Shelly.
- Whoo!

14:09.500 --> 14:11.198

14:58.375 --> 14:59.724

14:59.899 --> 15:01.552
I'’m closer than I appear.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.037
Almost there.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.003
Apologies for the delay.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.134
Your spritzer has arrived.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.657
- Finally.
- Here you go.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.921
And you'’re welcome.

15:23.096 --> 15:25.533
- You'’re welcome.
- Ramona, you remember Mako?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.535
You guys used to
play together.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.841
Yeah, that'’s it.
Keep it coming. Don'’t be stingy.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.366
That'’s enough now.
Don'’t overdo it.
I don'’t wanna be saturated.

15:32.540 --> 15:33.933
- You'’re welcome.
- Sorry.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.936
- I didn'’t mean to splash you.
- Oh, not at all.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.459
Excellent form, by the way.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.809
And extra points
for giving Mother here a rinse.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.421
Oh, this is my sister, Shelly.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.424
Stop.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.209
Hey, hey, hey.
Are you talking about me?

15:49.383 --> 15:51.037
Was that the sign
for "handsome"?

15:51.211 --> 15:53.343
Ugh.
There'’s more to me
than just looks.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.650
Hi, sorry to interrupt.
Would you care for a--

15:55.824 --> 15:57.782
I'’m okay. But thank you.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.263
Uh, you'’re-- you'’re welcome.

16:00.437 --> 16:03.136
So, is this-- is this
your first summer being here?

16:03.310 --> 16:05.529
At the shore? Have you--Are you going
to the club tonight?

16:05.703 --> 16:08.228
The club? Um, yeah...

16:08.402 --> 16:10.404
...that sounds fun.[Mako] Splendid.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.883
I'’ll meet you there.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.798
You'’ll find me
in the VIP section.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.062
Can'’t wait.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.242
Come on, Mom.
What'’s the big deal?

16:22.416 --> 16:25.114
It'’s not safe on land,
Ramona. You know that.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.595
I won'’t be gone long.
I'’ll be back
before you know it.

16:27.769 --> 16:29.553
Uh-uh, no. You are
not going up there alone.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.600
- I'’ll take Shelly.
- Girl, have you lost your mind?

16:32.774 --> 16:34.341
Shelly, go to your room.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.517
Go to your room.

16:39.911 --> 16:42.131
Ramona, honey,
you don'’t know this place.

16:42.305 --> 16:45.874
The crabs here,
- they are not like us.
- Mom, seriously?

16:46.048 --> 16:47.702
- Sweetie, they'’re jealous.
- Here we go.

16:47.876 --> 16:49.573
Stuck in this small town
their whole lives.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.880
We get to travel
wherever we want.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.795
We get to see
the whole world.

16:53.969 --> 16:57.625
Yeah, except everywhere we go,
we never leave the resort.

16:57.799 --> 17:01.498
Look, you are not
going on land, Ramona.
And that'’s final.

17:11.726 --> 17:16.557
So, probably another
quiet night in for us, huh?

17:19.342 --> 17:21.562
Yeah, sounds good.

17:24.521 --> 17:26.915
Oh, honey,
you got a little sauce

Oh, no. I already told you guys,
I'’m not going to the club.

You know what?
This is for your own good, Armen.

19:49.666 --> 19:51.233

whether you like it or not.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.231
Whoo! Yeah.

22:03.626 --> 22:04.584
Sorry.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.547
Hey, it'’s her.
Ask her to dance.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.070
What? Are you insane?

22:13.244 --> 22:15.508
- You got moves, girl.
- What?

22:15.682 --> 22:16.944
- Anemone.
- What did you say to me?

22:17.118 --> 22:19.076
What? Oh, no, no.
That wasn'’t me.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.687
That was him.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.602
- Him who?
- Huh?

22:22.776 --> 22:24.517
Okay,
you can come out now.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.259
Come on, man.
She thinks I'’m crazy.

22:28.434 --> 22:31.480
What are you doing?

22:31.654 --> 22:33.830
Sorry. He'’s not normally
this annoyingly adorable.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.833
Aw, he'’s so cute.

22:37.007 --> 22:38.357
Yo, Denise.
Check it out.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.010
I had one of these
when I was a kid.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.577
What is he doing?

22:41.751 --> 22:43.318
You'’re just such a sweetie,
aren'’t you?

22:43.492 --> 22:45.494
Yeah, he came with the shell,
you know?

22:45.668 --> 22:48.541
Say, I know you.
You'’re the spritzer boy.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.804
Hey, fellas.
It'’s the spritzer boy.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.501
He has a name, Mako.

22:52.675 --> 22:54.851
Yeah, please call me Spritz.
Less formal.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.593
You'’re funny.

22:57.767 --> 22:59.508
Hilarious.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.642
Now, why don'’t you take that
winning sense of humor of yours

23:02.816 --> 23:04.905
and shove off?[Bobby] What up, Mako?

23:06.123 --> 23:08.299
Bobby Marinara.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.432
- Hey.
- You messing with our boy?

23:10.606 --> 23:13.043
Hey!
Is there a problem down there?

23:13.217 --> 23:15.481
Ah, no, nah, we'’re just dancing.

23:15.655 --> 23:17.221
Just dancing. Right, Mako?

23:18.353 --> 23:21.095
Oh. Right.
Yeah, of course.
Dancing. Whoo.

23:21.269 --> 23:23.010
How was the offseason, boys?

23:23.184 --> 23:25.969
Another cold winter,
battling mediocrity?

23:26.143 --> 23:27.623
Oh, snap!

23:27.797 --> 23:29.190
What did I tell you
about the club, Mako?

23:29.364 --> 23:30.974
This is our turf.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.236
You are the surf.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.716
- Mic drop. Boom.
- Oh!

23:33.890 --> 23:36.240
Well, that'’s
delightful wordplay, Bobby,

23:36.415 --> 23:38.504
but I'’m afraid
your boy crossed the line.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.941
Crabs like you
shouldn'’t even be in here.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.769
Crabs like me...

23:42.943 --> 23:44.988
...are the reason
you have a job. For now.

23:45.162 --> 23:47.904
- Are you instigating to me?
- Why don'’t you
toddle off home sideways

23:48.078 --> 23:49.950
and eat some of
your mother'’s vile cooking?

23:50.124 --> 23:51.473
Oh!

23:51.647 --> 23:53.823
You did not just bring
Mrs. Marinara into this.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.695
<i>♪ Turn down for what? ♪</i>

23:57.827 --> 23:59.394
Nope. No.

24:03.398 --> 24:05.052
Hey, hey, hey.

24:05.226 --> 24:07.620
All right.
Get out of here.
All of youse.

24:07.794 --> 24:09.796
Oh, come on.
They started it, Bruno.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.145
And I'’m finishing it.

24:11.319 --> 24:13.190
Hey, watch the shell.
I just got a wax.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.670
Get your claws off of me.

24:16.890 --> 24:19.283
Jimmy, your shell'’s digging
into my side, man.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.068
Because your feet
are in my face.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.765
Your friends are jerks, Armen.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.332
Hey, you know what?

24:24.506 --> 24:25.507
We don'’t need
your stinking club.

24:25.681 --> 24:26.900
We can dance right here.

24:27.074 --> 24:29.163
Come on, Jimmy, dance.

24:29.337 --> 24:31.818
- I'’m coming. Here I go.
- Make me look like an idiot.
There we go.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.080
In your face.

24:33.254 --> 24:34.516
In your face.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.692
I'’m right in your face.

24:36.866 --> 24:38.999
-  In your face!
- Hey, where you going?

24:39.173 --> 24:42.393
This is exactly why
I didn'’t want
to come out tonight, Bobby.

24:42.568 --> 24:44.004
It'’s always
gotta end in a fight.

24:44.178 --> 24:45.614
What are you talking about?

24:45.788 --> 24:47.442
We had to defend our turf, bro.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.575
It'’s rule number one
of the brocal code.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.446
"Locals only, bro."

24:52.969 --> 24:54.493
Wait.
Is this about that girl?

24:54.667 --> 24:56.799
Why were you
talking to her anyway?

24:56.973 --> 24:58.801
What, you like her
- or something?
- What?

24:58.975 --> 25:00.499
No.
I don'’t even know her.

25:00.673 --> 25:02.109
She'’s a sea crab, bro.

25:02.283 --> 25:03.153
She'’s got gills.

25:03.327 --> 25:04.459
Doesn'’t she?

25:05.547 --> 25:06.853
I'’m out of here.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.419
Well, that'’s how it is, huh?

25:08.594 --> 25:11.771
Hey, don'’t forget who
your friends are, Armen.

25:11.945 --> 25:12.946
Friends?

25:13.120 --> 25:14.817
You used me
to get in the club.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.689
Yeah, but that doesn'’t mean
I didn'’t want to hang out.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.212
Well, I don'’t want
to hang out with you, Bobby.

25:19.430 --> 25:21.432
All right.
I never want to hang out.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.999
Then go home, Armen.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.567
Nobody'’s gonna notice
you'’re gone anyway.

25:40.626 --> 25:42.192
Hey. You okay, Armen?

25:42.366 --> 25:44.368
It got a little
heated back there.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.284
I know. I know.
I just-- I--

25:47.458 --> 25:49.591
I'’ll talk to him
in the morning. Okay?

25:56.076 --> 25:57.425
Gotta go!

25:57.599 --> 26:00.254
Not so tough without
your boys around, are you?

26:02.082 --> 26:04.127
All alone, are we?
What happened?

26:04.301 --> 26:06.390
You couldn'’t close
with my girl?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.697
Where are you going?

26:08.871 --> 26:10.960
We just want to talk. Here.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.658
No, no, please no. No.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.398
- No, no. Stop. Stop.
- Let me help you out.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.141
Oh, I can see your bum.

26:18.315 --> 26:20.100
- There'’s the bum now.
- Give me back my shell.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.667
- Would you look at his head?
- Here, up to me.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.234
No, please. Please stop.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.194
Ugh. I wouldn'’t be caught dead
wearing this thing.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.326
- Give it back. No.
- Whoa.

26:31.285 --> 26:34.549
Come on. Stop, stop.
It'’s all I have.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.551
Come on, Nigel.
Give the rest of us a turn.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.379
Ugh.
Do you ever wash this thing?

26:38.553 --> 26:41.251
Give me my shell.

26:46.430 --> 26:48.911
Playtime'’s over, spritzer boy.

26:52.654 --> 26:54.569
No, no, no.

26:56.092 --> 26:57.746
Leave him alone.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.748
What do you care?
He'’s a townie.

26:59.922 --> 27:04.057
- Armen! Armen, help me.
- I'’m coming, Anemone.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.188
Help, help.

27:06.799 --> 27:08.670
Armen!

27:08.844 --> 27:10.019
I'’m coming, I'’m coming.

27:12.761 --> 27:14.284
Closer, a little closer.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.896
This is not how
I'’m going out, Armen!

27:18.941 --> 27:21.640
Anemone!
Anemone, just hang on!

27:25.644 --> 27:28.211
- Hey.
- Ramona, let'’s go.

27:28.385 --> 27:30.866
Get your claws off of me.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.044
Go!

27:36.916 --> 27:38.526
Hey, look out!

27:59.852 --> 28:00.940
Here, hurry.

28:01.114 --> 28:02.245
I got you, sweetie.

28:04.204 --> 28:06.162
My shell!

28:39.761 --> 28:40.762
Huh?

28:42.895 --> 28:43.939
Whoa.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.550
This can'’t be our town.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.121
Ma? Ma!

28:53.383 --> 28:56.778
- Bobby, is that you?
- Pop? Where'’s Ma?

28:56.952 --> 29:01.043
We'’re okay, Bobby.
You hungry?

29:01.217 --> 29:03.219
Yeah. Yeah, I could eat.

29:03.393 --> 29:06.745
All right now.
Uh, where'’s my kitchen?

29:06.919 --> 29:10.444
- Ah, this will do.
- Hey, yo, Bobby.
You all right?

29:10.618 --> 29:12.794
Oof.
That was a rough one.

29:12.968 --> 29:14.665
By the way, Mrs. Marinara,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.667
I'’ll take a little bit
of whatever you'’re cooking.

29:16.842 --> 29:19.322
Hey, anybody seen my nephew?

29:19.496 --> 29:21.063
Armen, where are ya?

29:21.237 --> 29:24.066
-  Armen?
- Armen?

29:24.893 --> 29:27.026
Armen? Oh, no.

29:27.200 --> 29:29.158
Armen.[crab] Armen.

29:29.332 --> 29:30.333
Armen?

30:04.193 --> 30:05.281
Where am I?

30:09.372 --> 30:10.460
Anemone!

30:14.073 --> 30:15.683
Anemone?

30:19.121 --> 30:20.122
It'’s gone.

30:27.216 --> 30:28.827
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, wait up.

30:29.001 --> 30:30.872
Have you seen my shell?

30:31.046 --> 30:33.962
It'’s about yea high
and it has an annoying
anemone on the back...

30:34.136 --> 30:36.225
Shh. Keep it down....a little slimy-- Sorry.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.619
It'’s just that you develop
sort of a love-hate
relationship over the years

30:38.793 --> 30:41.143
which also is very symbiotic
and codependent.

30:45.452 --> 30:46.409
Hide.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.237
Where? I don'’t have--

30:58.595 --> 31:00.075
That was a close one.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.469
Hey, stay safe out there.

31:02.643 --> 31:04.079
All right--

31:08.736 --> 31:09.693
Oh, no.

31:46.556 --> 31:48.384
- Good luck to you.
- Hey.

31:54.303 --> 31:58.046
What? What the shell is that?
Wait, no. No.

31:58.220 --> 32:01.180
Hello?
Uh, there seems to be
some kind of mistake.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.877
Hey,
you get what you get, pal.

32:03.051 --> 32:05.575
It ain'’t like any of us
got the shell of our dreams.

32:05.749 --> 32:06.750
Ain'’t that the truth?

32:06.925 --> 32:09.101
I'’ll trade you.

32:09.275 --> 32:10.711
No, you don'’t understand.

32:10.885 --> 32:13.932
My shell is very
important to me. Okay.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.629
Okay. Bye.

32:15.803 --> 32:17.718
Has anyone here seen it?

32:17.892 --> 32:19.938
It'’s-- It'’s about my size.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.548
It'’s tight but not too tight.

32:21.722 --> 32:23.071
Kind of a tapered cut
at the hip.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.508
- Ah!
- Hey, watch where you'’re going.

32:25.682 --> 32:28.424
Oh, sorry, sorry.
I was just looking for my shell.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.861
- It was stolen.
- Stolen, huh?

32:31.036 --> 32:33.038
Is that an accusation?

32:33.212 --> 32:34.561
What? No, no, no. I--Whoa, whoa.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.606
Hang on a sec.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

32:36.780 --> 32:38.695
- I think I know this guy.
- You do?

32:38.869 --> 32:40.219
Me? This guy?

32:40.393 --> 32:42.438
It'’s Armen, right?
Yeah, you know, Armen.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.833
Is he a friend of yours
or a friend of ours?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.704
He'’s Bruno'’s nephew.

32:47.878 --> 32:49.489
Oh, yeah.

32:49.663 --> 32:52.100
How you doin'’?

32:52.274 --> 32:55.321
I'’m good. You know,
lost and afraid for my life.

32:55.495 --> 32:57.584
But, um, other than that,
I can'’t complain.

32:57.758 --> 33:01.370
Hey, tell your uncle
Big Sal and Little Junior
says hi.

33:01.544 --> 33:03.024
Okay.
Will do, Little Junior.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.592
No. I'’m Big Sal.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.376
He'’s Little Junior.

33:07.550 --> 33:09.813
Right. That--
That makes more sense.

33:09.988 --> 33:11.641
So, what is this?
Your first pinch?

33:11.815 --> 33:14.079
Ah, don'’t worry about it.
Everybody gets pinched.

33:14.253 --> 33:17.430
What matters is that
you don'’t squeal.

33:17.604 --> 33:18.997
- All right?
- Yeah.

33:19.171 --> 33:20.476
Don'’t say nothin'’. All right?

33:20.650 --> 33:22.000
No, no, I wasn'’t.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.263
- Ow.
- You don'’t know nothin'’.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.526
No, I don'’t.
I'’m confused, truth be told.

33:26.700 --> 33:27.831
That'’s a good kid.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.398
Oh.

33:29.572 --> 33:30.530
What'’s happening?

33:30.704 --> 33:32.880
Hermit crabs, two for one.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.621
Hey, kid.
You want a hermit crab?

33:40.931 --> 33:42.803
It'’s happening again.

34:00.560 --> 34:03.563
Hey, uh, are you okay?

34:03.737 --> 34:06.000
You'’re alive.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.523
It'’s you.

34:08.437 --> 34:09.482
Where are we?

34:10.526 --> 34:12.224
On the boardwalk, I think.

34:12.398 --> 34:14.356
Uh, how far
are we from the ocean?

34:14.530 --> 34:15.923
In-- In crab legs?

34:16.097 --> 34:18.578
I don'’t know.
Maybe a million, give or take.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.624
I'’ve never been
out of the ocean
for this long.

34:21.798 --> 34:24.018
If I don'’t get to water soon,
I--

34:24.192 --> 34:27.674
I-- I don'’t know
how long I'’ve got.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.850
I don'’t belong in here.

34:30.024 --> 34:31.634
What, you think
we belong in here?

34:31.808 --> 34:33.245
No, no.
That'’s not what I meant.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.421
You think you'’re better than us,
huh, princess?

34:35.595 --> 34:37.205
No, I--Hey, guys, guys, guys,
come on.

34:37.379 --> 34:38.815
Go easy on her, okay?
She'’s with me.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.253
What is she?
Your girlfriend or something?

34:41.427 --> 34:42.645
What, are you kidding me?

34:42.819 --> 34:44.952
Armen knows better
than to date a sea crab.

34:45.126 --> 34:48.434
-  Yeah.
- No. Yeah. What?
Locals only, guys. Hello.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.350
You don'’t understand.
I need to get home.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.222
Home?
We'’re not going home,
sea crab.

34:54.396 --> 34:56.268
At least not
the one you came from.

34:56.442 --> 35:00.446
- What do you mean?
- This is a death sentence.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.752
How-- How exactly?

35:02.926 --> 35:04.363
I want that one.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.060
Are you gonna feed it
this time?

35:06.234 --> 35:07.192
That'’s how.

35:14.547 --> 35:15.678
Again?

35:17.245 --> 35:19.595
Tell them nothing,
you hear me? Nothing!

35:20.683 --> 35:22.990
Thank you for coming.

35:23.164 --> 35:25.949
Now, I know the storm
has affected all of us.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.864
Yeah. Just look at poor Curly.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.215
The guy'’s living
in a milk carton now.

35:30.389 --> 35:31.694
Aw, poor guy.[all] Aw.

35:31.868 --> 35:35.002
Everyone, this is Val
and her daughter Shelly.

35:35.176 --> 35:38.179
Her other daughter, Ramona,
has not been seen
since the storm.

35:38.353 --> 35:40.921
- Oh, Val.
- Don'’t you worry,
we'’re gonna find her.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.705
As some of you know,

35:42.879 --> 35:46.231
my nephew, Armen,
is also missing.[all] Oh.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.407
- Whatever we can do to help.
- That'’s right.

35:48.581 --> 35:52.976
So, if anyone has any info
on Armen or Ramona'’s
last-known whereabouts--

35:53.151 --> 35:54.500
Why don'’t you ask Mako?

35:54.674 --> 35:56.545
He was with the girl
last night.

36:01.115 --> 36:05.511

I don'’t know what'’s worse:
dying or knowing
my mother was right.

sea crab?

38:35.400 --> 38:37.445

in our drinking water!

38:38.141 --> 38:39.186
Fine.

38:39.839 --> 38:41.188
All yours.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.538
I need to get
- out of here.
- Hey, hey.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.671
Maybe we should
- just try to adapt.
- What?

38:45.845 --> 38:47.325
There'’s obviously
no way out.

38:47.499 --> 38:49.109
I mean...
...except the way in.

38:49.283 --> 38:50.893
Wait. That'’s it.

38:51.067 --> 38:54.027
The way in is the way out.

38:54.201 --> 38:56.464
- Huh?
- Now how do I...

38:56.638 --> 38:58.161
Hey, thanks.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.343
Bedazzles.

39:07.997 --> 39:11.044
Yoo-hoo!
Shiny lady! Shiny lady!

39:11.784 --> 39:13.873
Ah.

39:14.047 --> 39:16.005
Hello, gorgeous.

39:16.179 --> 39:18.486
Uh-huh, that'’s it.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.620
- You know you like what you see.
- Whoa, whoa.
Hey, what are you doing?

39:21.794 --> 39:24.187
- Getting their attention.
- Excuse me, excuse me.

39:24.362 --> 39:25.841
How much for this one?

39:26.015 --> 39:28.453
- It'’s working.
- Uh-huh. I see that.

39:28.627 --> 39:29.758
Oh, no, no, no, no.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.762
- The man is coming!
- Save yourselves!

39:36.809 --> 39:39.420
Ramona,
- get out of the way!
- No, I'’m tryna get in the way.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.814
That'’s it. Come to Mama.

39:41.988 --> 39:44.207
Oh, this one,
she'’s out of her mind.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.993
Look, I know that sea crabs
are wrong about
absolutely everything,

39:47.167 --> 39:49.604
but in this one particular case,
she may have
a teeny, tiny point.

39:49.778 --> 39:52.259
Don'’t miss your chance.
This train
is leaving the station.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.869
You better be right.

39:59.397 --> 40:03.488
- They don'’t pinch, do they?
- What? These little cuties? Nah.

40:16.370 --> 40:18.024
Freedom!

40:18.198 --> 40:19.678
Come on.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.427

when they were shut.

41:34.187 --> 41:36.885
- Look. Water. Let'’s go there.
- Wait, wait.
No, no, no, no.

41:37.059 --> 41:37.973
- On the count of three.
- No.

41:38.147 --> 41:39.627
- One, two.
- Stop counting.

41:39.801 --> 41:42.238
Whoo!

41:47.287 --> 41:51.683
Ah. It'’s not salt water
but it still hits the spot.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.859
Come on in.
The water'’s great.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.731
I'’m good, thanks.

42:02.432 --> 42:05.087
Why are you afraid of the water?[chuckles] What? Afraid?

42:05.261 --> 42:06.698
You said afraid-- Please.

42:06.872 --> 42:09.004
You got a funny brain.

42:11.572 --> 42:13.748
Whoo. My heart. Wow.

42:13.922 --> 42:16.011
What'’s the matter with you?
You can'’t swim?

42:16.185 --> 42:18.318
No, no, I can swim.
I can. I totally--
I just don'’t anymore.

42:18.492 --> 42:21.408
I'’ve heard some
health advisory things
that just gave me pause.

42:21.582 --> 42:23.410
- Put it that way.
- Uh-huh.

42:23.584 --> 42:24.977
And what'’s the real reason?

42:25.151 --> 42:26.848
I said I don'’t wanna talk
about it. All right?

42:27.022 --> 42:29.547
Well, you didn'’t, but whatever.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.637
You know...

42:32.811 --> 42:35.988
...this may be the furthest away
from my mother I'’ve ever been.

42:36.162 --> 42:37.555
Whoo-hoo!

42:37.729 --> 42:39.861
It feels amazing.

42:40.035 --> 42:42.255
Very cool. Very cool.

42:42.429 --> 42:44.953
There'’s just no
comfortable way to wear
this thing. Is it on straight?

42:45.127 --> 42:47.216
Hey. Hey, where you going?

42:47.390 --> 42:50.524
When we get back,
my mom'’s never gonna let me
out of her sight ever again.

42:50.698 --> 42:52.395
I'’ll be underwater
for the rest of my life.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.789
So I say
we take the scenic route.

42:54.963 --> 42:56.791
Yeah, or, you know,
the route less traveled.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.228
Could be a fun option.
That'’s worked for me
in the past.

42:59.402 --> 43:00.708
Ooh! What'’s that?

43:03.406 --> 43:04.494
Wow.

43:04.669 --> 43:06.322
Mmm.

43:06.496 --> 43:08.760
- How you like me now?
- Help. Help.

43:12.459 --> 43:13.503
What?

43:15.549 --> 43:17.377
Mmm. Dang, that'’s good.

43:17.551 --> 43:19.118
- What is in this?
- It'’s just pure sugar.

43:19.292 --> 43:20.554
Whoa.

43:20.728 --> 43:22.382
- It'’s got a bit of a kick.
- Look out!

43:24.514 --> 43:25.690
You'’re gonna get us killed.

43:25.864 --> 43:27.561
You have no idea
what you'’re doing.

43:27.735 --> 43:30.216
Please, if it wasn'’t for me,
you'’d still be in the cage.

43:30.390 --> 43:32.087
Fair point.
That'’s a fair point.

43:32.261 --> 43:34.394
Now can I return the favor
by getting you home
in one piece?

43:34.568 --> 43:36.004
Alive preferably.

43:36.178 --> 43:37.397
- Please?
- Fine.

43:37.571 --> 43:40.182
Wonderful.
Now where is the ocean?

43:40.356 --> 43:42.271
I-- I can'’t see a thing
from down here.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.012
We gotta get to higher ground.

43:45.448 --> 43:47.537
There.
That looks like it'’s headed up.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.365
Nice and slow too.

43:57.025 --> 43:59.332
Come on, come on.
We should sit in front
to get a good view.

44:00.594 --> 44:02.161
All right, up you get.

44:12.388 --> 44:15.217
Seriously?
We could walk quicker.

44:15.391 --> 44:20.135
I mean, if this is what passes
for fun in your town,
I'’ll take the ocean any day.

44:20.309 --> 44:23.530
Yeah? Okay, well if the ocean'’s
so great, then why didn'’t you
just stay there?

44:23.704 --> 44:27.273
You know, you'’re just
like those meathead friends
of yours at the club.

44:27.447 --> 44:31.146
"Ay, yo, way.
Forget about it. House music."

44:31.320 --> 44:33.888
That'’s
- a terrible impression.
- It'’s spot on.

44:34.062 --> 44:35.934
- I'’m nothing like those guys.
- Yeah, right.

44:36.108 --> 44:37.979
And besides,
I'’d rather be a meathead

44:38.153 --> 44:40.416
than one of those
Richie Rich pretty boys
that you find attractive.

44:40.590 --> 44:42.592
"Where'’s my tea and crumpets, love?

44:42.767 --> 44:45.073
You know what, never mind,
I'’ll just take yours.

44:45.247 --> 44:48.076
Oh, I can see your bum.
There'’s Armen'’s bum."

44:48.250 --> 44:51.297
You know what?
As soon as we
get off this thing,

44:51.471 --> 44:53.516
I think we should just
- go our separate ways.
- Sounds good to me.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.041
I don'’t need anybody else
holding me back, Mom.

44:56.215 --> 44:58.434
And I don'’t need
a tour guide
with a death wish.

44:58.608 --> 45:00.262
Great, you'’ll go your way
and I'’ll go mine.

45:00.436 --> 45:03.091
- That'’s exactly what I want.
- Well, I said it first, so...

45:03.265 --> 45:05.180
I'’m saying it too.
We both said it.

45:05.354 --> 45:07.400
Finally.
There'’s the ocean. See?

45:07.574 --> 45:09.228
Now how do we get down?

45:11.621 --> 45:13.841
- Oh, no.

49:52.598 --> 49:54.904
All right, come here.
All of youse.

49:55.862 --> 49:56.950
Let me tell you a story.

49:57.124 --> 49:59.300
I used to be tough,
all right.

49:59.474 --> 50:02.651
Once upon a time,
I used to get into fights too.

50:02.825 --> 50:05.959
And sometimes
I would lose a claw.

50:06.133 --> 50:10.877
And every time I lost a claw,
another one would grow back
in its place.

50:11.051 --> 50:14.185
But then I got into
one fight too many.

50:14.359 --> 50:18.058
And when I lost my claw,
it didn'’t grow back.

50:19.190 --> 50:20.278
Capisce.

50:21.453 --> 50:23.846
Now you keep going
down this road,

50:24.021 --> 50:25.631
how do you think
it'’s gonna end?

50:27.850 --> 50:29.287
What-- What'’s going on
in there?

50:29.461 --> 50:31.550
Sea crabs.

50:31.724 --> 50:32.942
What are they doing in there?

50:33.117 --> 50:34.292
That'’s our club.

50:34.466 --> 50:37.121
It'’s my club.
I'’ll handle it.

No.

Hey, it'’s not your fault.

52:28.275 --> 52:31.017
I got myself
into this mess.

52:31.191 --> 52:36.240
There'’s just, like,
all this pressure to be
perfect all the time. I--

52:36.414 --> 52:39.852
I guess
I just wanted to make
my own mistakes for once.

52:40.505 --> 52:41.723
You know?

52:41.897 --> 52:43.638
Well, I'’d--
I'’d say you did it.

52:43.812 --> 52:45.466
I mean,
this has gotta be up there.

52:45.640 --> 52:48.121
As mistakes go,
you know, top five ever made.

52:48.295 --> 52:50.906
So congrats.
You should be proud.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.038
Shut up, Armen.

52:52.212 --> 52:54.083
Armen!

52:57.696 --> 52:59.176
Where are you, buddy?

52:59.350 --> 53:00.351
Huh?

53:04.920 --> 53:06.052
Hey, kid.

53:07.619 --> 53:08.620
Huh?

53:10.317 --> 53:12.450
Kid, you all right?
Are you lost?

53:14.191 --> 53:15.235
Do you need help?

53:19.631 --> 53:22.329
Whoa.
Okay, clearly you
don'’t need my help.

53:22.503 --> 53:24.766
And I assume
you'’re not lost neither.

53:24.940 --> 53:27.029
I got it.
You'’re probably
looking for your sister.

53:27.204 --> 53:28.857
Well, I was just looking
for my friend and--

53:30.555 --> 53:33.035
All right, look, I get it.
You don'’t trust me.

53:33.210 --> 53:36.952
But we didn'’t have
anything to do with
anything Mako was saying. I--

53:37.126 --> 53:40.173
I mean, we'’re land crabs,
but we'’re not animals.

53:40.347 --> 53:42.654
Can I get off the ground now?

53:43.959 --> 53:45.396
Hello?

53:45.570 --> 53:47.398
Really? Nothing?
All right.

53:49.835 --> 53:51.228
Maybe it'’s better
she'’s not looking.

53:53.404 --> 53:55.449
Okay, I did it.
Hey, wait up!

53:55.623 --> 53:57.408
You think maybe
we could join forces?

53:57.582 --> 53:59.671
I could use the protection, obviously.

54:05.851 --> 54:08.810
Sorry, I didn'’t realize
you were, uh...

54:08.984 --> 54:11.073
I mean,
I thought you could, uh...

54:12.336 --> 54:13.424
Were you born this way?

54:17.993 --> 54:20.909
Me? [chuckles] Yeah, yeah,
I was born this way.

54:21.083 --> 54:22.563
Unfortunately.

54:25.174 --> 54:26.567
Oh, hey, you know what?

54:26.741 --> 54:28.569
I got a cousin who'’s deaf.
Do you know him?

54:28.743 --> 54:31.442
Nah, I mean,
of course you don'’t know him.

54:31.616 --> 54:35.228
I just mean, you know,
like, I thought maybe
you'’d stick together.

54:35.402 --> 54:37.709
You know,
'’cause it'’s probably
not easy to--

54:37.883 --> 54:43.845
You know, I mean,
it'’s gotta be hard
to deal with-- to-- to--

54:44.019 --> 54:46.935
To deal with stupid idiots
asking boneheaded questions.

54:47.109 --> 54:50.896
Bobby, you really
are as dumb as you look.

54:58.251 --> 55:00.166
Look, I'’m sorry.
Okay? I--

55:00.340 --> 55:02.951
Everybody looks at me
and assumes that
I'’m some meathead

55:03.125 --> 55:04.518
that wants to fight
all the time.

55:05.780 --> 55:08.043
You know, it'’s like
they expect it from me and--

55:09.349 --> 55:12.439
Well, I'’m just sick and tired
of not being seen for me.

55:12.613 --> 55:13.614
You know what I mean?

55:17.226 --> 55:18.837
Yeah, I have a feeling you do.

55:19.011 --> 55:25.365
Hey, hey, hey.
Maybe we have more
in common than we think.

55:27.541 --> 55:29.195
That'’s not what I said, is it?

55:30.762 --> 55:32.285
Well, was it close at least?

55:34.200 --> 55:37.246
Come on, kid.
Let'’s get you back.

55:38.073 --> 55:39.161
Thanks.

55:40.511 --> 55:41.816
You know, this is cool.

55:41.990 --> 55:43.992
I never had
a female friend before.

55:45.690 --> 55:46.952
Armen?

55:47.126 --> 55:48.736
Can I ask you something?[Armen] Sure.

55:48.910 --> 55:52.784
If Mako
hadn'’t interrupted us
at the club,

55:52.958 --> 55:56.135
would you have asked me
- to dance?
- What? No. Definitely not.

55:56.309 --> 55:58.137
Oh.

55:58.311 --> 56:00.531
No, I just mean,
I-- I'’ve never done
anything like that before,

56:00.705 --> 56:04.578
so it would have been completely
out of character for me.

56:04.752 --> 56:06.537
To ask a sea crab
to dance?

56:07.233 --> 56:09.409
Or-- Or anyone.

56:11.237 --> 56:15.023
I haven'’t done a lot of things,
not for a long time.

56:15.676 --> 56:16.851
Why not?

56:19.593 --> 56:21.552
There was a storm
when I was a kid,

56:21.726 --> 56:24.598
and my parents
didn'’t make it.

56:24.772 --> 56:26.295
I haven'’t been
in the water since.

56:26.470 --> 56:28.167
Oh, Armen.

56:28.341 --> 56:32.650
The truth is
I'’ve been hiding in my shell
my entire life.

56:33.477 --> 56:35.392
After they were gone,

56:35.566 --> 56:39.265
it was just a good excuse
to stay inside.

56:39.439 --> 56:43.530
Hey, I think you'’re
a lot braver than
you give yourself credit for.

56:43.704 --> 56:47.055
Yeah, well, you'’re seeing me
on a particularly good day.

56:47.229 --> 56:51.408
I mean,
if I'’ve been brave at all,
it'’s only because of you.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.106
I can'’t believe
I just said that.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.630
- I'’m such a weirdo.
- Yeah, you are.

56:57.675 --> 56:58.850
You'’re not like anyone.

56:59.024 --> 57:00.329
Oh.

57:02.636 --> 57:04.159
That'’s a good thing.

57:10.818 --> 57:12.298
Well, this is your stop.

57:16.650 --> 57:18.826
Don'’t worry, kid.
We'’ll find '’em.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.872
But no more sneaking out,
all right?

57:21.046 --> 57:23.788
- Get your claws off of her!
- No, ma'’am.

57:23.962 --> 57:25.833
We were just out here looking
for your daughter and--

57:26.007 --> 57:29.010
Don'’t you come near us!

57:29.184 --> 57:30.838
I know exactly who he is.

57:31.012 --> 57:32.318
Ma'’am, you don'’t understand.

57:32.492 --> 57:34.929
- Haven'’t you done enough?
- I'’m sorry, I--

57:35.103 --> 57:37.105
I wasn'’t--You stay away from her!

57:37.279 --> 57:40.021
No, ma'’am, please.
I'’m not who you think I am.

57:40.195 --> 57:42.067
Stay away!

57:47.899 --> 57:49.466
Mmm.

Donny, Donny, what'’s going on?

59:44.450 --> 59:46.713
I don'’t get paid enough
for this. I'’m out!

59:51.805 --> 59:54.068
Oh, no.

59:54.242 --> 59:55.635
- What have you guys done?
- Huh?

59:57.768 --> 01:00:00.292
Hey, look who finally
came to his senses.

01:00:00.466 --> 01:00:02.903
Here we go.
Now it'’s a fair fight.

01:00:04.339 --> 01:00:06.080
Where'’s the fun in that?

01:00:08.343 --> 01:00:10.519
Boys, please, no more fighting.

01:00:10.694 --> 01:00:11.608
Oh!

01:00:11.782 --> 01:00:14.828
Here comes the Condition!

01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.181
Whoa. Guys, guys,
it doesn'’t have to be like this.

01:00:20.355 --> 01:00:21.574
Bobby, help!

01:00:23.141 --> 01:00:25.883
Let him go!

01:00:26.057 --> 01:00:28.189
Manny, no. Let go.

01:00:28.363 --> 01:00:30.496
Guys, come on.
Break it up.

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:38.069
That'’s enough!

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:51.256
Hey, he had it coming, Bobby.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:52.736
You did
what you had to do.

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:54.215
Way to go, man.

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:56.174
Is a high five appropriate
in this moment?

01:00:56.348 --> 01:01:00.613
Mark my words,
this isn'’t over!

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.659
Oh, yeah?
Looks pretty done to me.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.964
Your friend Armen...

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:06.488
he'’s dead.

01:01:14.366 --> 01:01:15.889
Anemone, are you okay?

01:01:16.063 --> 01:01:20.589
- My nephew, is it true?
- The wave.

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:22.417
- Mako.
- What did they do to you?

01:01:22.591 --> 01:01:23.854
I think he'’s shell-shocked.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:28.859
This means war.

01:01:29.033 --> 01:01:30.338
Come on!

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:32.863
You coming, Bobby?

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:45.353
- Armen?
- Yeah?

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:47.399
What do you think it'’ll be like
when we get back?

01:01:48.226 --> 01:01:50.663
Big step.

01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:52.665
Thanks.

01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:57.583
I mean, you know,
what do you think
they'’ll think of us?

01:01:58.410 --> 01:02:00.412
- Us?
- Yeah.

01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:01.761
Us.

01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:13.555
Hey, I think I found
a little calamari.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.515
Oh, no, no, no,
that'’s just chewing gum.

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:19.126
- Ooh! Found some cannoli.
- Yeah? Let me see.

01:02:19.692 --> 01:02:21.433
Oh! What is this?

01:02:26.438 --> 01:02:27.874
No. No, Ramona, I--

01:02:29.876 --> 01:02:31.486
What are you doing, kid?

01:02:31.660 --> 01:02:33.140
Oh, whoa.

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:35.099
Ramona--

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.405
Hey, kid. Come here.
Let me give you
a piece of advice, right?

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:41.018
A young guy like you,
you don'’t want to get
tied down yet.

01:02:41.192 --> 01:02:42.628
Just forget about her.

01:02:45.587 --> 01:02:46.545
Ramona, wait.

01:02:46.719 --> 01:02:48.068
Here.
Want some cannoli?

01:02:49.896 --> 01:02:51.419
Who turns down cannoli?

01:02:57.034 --> 01:02:58.078
Ramona!

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.213
Ramona, I'’m sorry.
I messed up back there.

01:03:02.387 --> 01:03:05.346
I just--
Please, just give me
another chance?

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.871
What, are you gonna
introduce me to your friends?

01:03:08.045 --> 01:03:09.916
Well--Are you gonna meet my family?

01:03:10.090 --> 01:03:12.527
I mean, what do you think
my mother'’s gonna say?

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:15.530
- Ramona.
- Forget it, Armen.

01:03:15.704 --> 01:03:17.750
This was never gonna work out.

01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:35.289
It'’s okay. I got you.

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:50.783
This is our beach.
It'’s time to take it back.

01:03:50.957 --> 01:03:53.742
Tourist season is officially

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:55.309
over!

01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:58.704
What are we doing here?

01:03:58.878 --> 01:04:01.272
How many claws
must be lost?

01:04:01.446 --> 01:04:03.361
Your nephew is dead
because of them.

01:04:03.535 --> 01:04:06.886
So, if you won'’t fight for this,
what will you fight for?

01:04:12.936 --> 01:04:15.068
Who do they think they are?

01:04:15.242 --> 01:04:17.636
If we let them take
our summer vacation,
what'’s next?

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:21.770
Spring break?
Winter holiday? Boxing Day?

01:04:21.945 --> 01:04:24.643
Are we gonna let them
run us out of here?

01:04:24.817 --> 01:04:28.255
Or are we gonna fight?

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.604
Are you with me?

01:04:31.737 --> 01:04:34.740
Um, I mean-- For Ramona!

01:04:34.914 --> 01:04:36.829
For Ramona!

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.182
Hold on, Ramona.

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.792
The ocean'’s right there.

01:04:43.967 --> 01:04:45.446
It'’s just on the other side
of this dune.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:47.013
See? It'’s right over there.

01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:59.286
- No.
- It'’s too far. I can'’t. I--

01:05:01.027 --> 01:05:03.900
Ramona.
No, no, no. Please.
Please wake up.

01:05:04.074 --> 01:05:06.250
Come on.

01:05:06.424 --> 01:05:09.209
I can'’t do this without you.

01:05:09.383 --> 01:05:11.342
I'’m not strong enough.

01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:59.346
For Ramona!

01:06:00.739 --> 01:06:02.088
For Armen!

01:06:02.262 --> 01:06:03.394
Armen!

01:06:09.835 --> 01:06:11.750
I'’m gonna go get a snack.
Bye, Dad.

01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:13.143
Have fun.

01:06:13.317 --> 01:06:15.058
Whoa.
Really packed in here.

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:16.668
Huh?

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:34.642
Gotcha!

01:06:37.689 --> 01:06:40.866
Crank it. Crank it. Oh!

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.088
Here comes the Condition!
Boom! Boom!

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:49.048
Attack!

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:52.878
One order of
Ma'’s special meatballs,
coming up.

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:56.838
Love you, Ma!

01:06:57.883 --> 01:06:59.711
Love you too, baby!

01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.495
Where do you think
you'’re going, huh?

01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:03.541
Light '’em up, ladies!

01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:06.979
Fire!

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:11.940
Ooh.

01:07:22.995 --> 01:07:24.779
- Bruno!
- You came.

01:07:24.953 --> 01:07:27.304
Ah, someone'’s gotta
look out for you knuckleheads.

01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:28.479
Look out.

01:07:30.655 --> 01:07:32.309
For Armen!

01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:33.614
What the--

01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:51.371
Wait. What is going on here?

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:20.748
Ramona!

01:09:44.267 --> 01:09:46.094
You'’re okay.[Val] Ramona!

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:47.705
Mom.

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:48.923
Shelly.

01:09:50.098 --> 01:09:51.796
Oh, my baby.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.539
Mom. I'’m so sorry.

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:57.976
Oh, honey. I'’m sorry.

01:09:58.150 --> 01:09:59.934
- Hey, Armen.
- Yo, Armen.

01:10:00.108 --> 01:10:01.806
That was legendary.

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:04.852
- Way to go, buddy.
- Bro, you were awesome out there.

01:10:05.026 --> 01:10:07.203
I am so proud of you, kid.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:12.773
Yeah, so, uh,
you gonna introduce us
to your friend over there?

01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:17.343
This is Ramona.

01:10:20.564 --> 01:10:21.565
My girlfriend.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.220
Wait. Your girlfriend?

01:10:25.177 --> 01:10:26.570
You got a girlfriend.

01:10:26.744 --> 01:10:28.224
Armen'’s got a girlfriend!

01:10:28.398 --> 01:10:31.357
- Holy Bon Jovi.
- Way to go, Armen.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.925
Thank you for saving
my daughter.

01:10:34.099 --> 01:10:35.796
You are very brave.

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.842
See? Told you so.

01:10:38.016 --> 01:10:39.887
Yeah, well,
she did the same for me.

01:10:40.584 --> 01:10:42.063
How did we get here?

01:10:48.679 --> 01:10:52.160
You wanna know
how we got here?
Mako lied.

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.075
That'’s how we got here.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:58.036
Well, that'’s not true.
Tell them, Mako.

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.386
Well, I just thought--
I mean--

01:11:02.823 --> 01:11:04.260
Well, I saw her first!

01:11:04.434 --> 01:11:07.088
I bribed your way
into the finest prep schools,

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:09.177
and this is how you repay me?

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:12.268
Oh, you'’re just
- like your father.
- No, Mommy, please don'’t go.

01:11:12.442 --> 01:11:14.966
And if you do,
will you continue
to support me financially?

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.054
Mother!

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:20.363
So, you wanna come
for dinner?

01:11:20.537 --> 01:11:21.842
I'’m making a sauce.

01:11:22.016 --> 01:11:25.150
I'’d like that very much.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.600
Nature.
It'’s so beautiful.

01:11:44.561 --> 01:11:45.605
On three.

01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:48.695
One! Two! Pull!

01:11:53.526 --> 01:11:55.136
Shore Point!

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.922
Back in business, baby!

01:11:58.096 --> 01:12:01.099
Hey, Marinara.

01:12:06.757 --> 01:12:08.498
You got something
to say, Mako?

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.370
I'’ve got something for you.

01:12:14.765 --> 01:12:15.809
It'’s a start.

01:12:16.723 --> 01:12:18.029
Your mother
put you up to this?

01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:19.596
Yes.

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:22.903
She'’s got good taste.

01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.078
You treasure her.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:28.213
Vacancy chain!

01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:30.171
- Vacancy chain?
- Vacancy chain.

01:12:30.346 --> 01:12:32.043
- Vacancy chain!
- Vacancy chain!

01:12:32.217 --> 01:12:34.219
Whoo-hoo!

01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:44.925
Aw, yeah. This is butter.

01:12:45.099 --> 01:12:46.187
Definitely butter.

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:48.581
Beautiful.

01:12:48.755 --> 01:12:51.323
All right, let me take
this puppy for a spin.

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:54.195
Hello, Denise. Looking well?

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:58.809
Oh, Jimmy, I think
I'’m coming down with
the Condition.

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.027
Mmm.

01:13:01.115 --> 01:13:02.900
She called me the Condition.

01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:04.989
I told you it was gonna stick,
baby!

01:13:05.163 --> 01:13:07.252
Way to go, Jimmy.

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:09.123
Hey, hold up.
Hold up, Armen.

01:13:09.297 --> 01:13:11.561
What'’s going on?
I don'’t know.

01:13:11.735 --> 01:13:13.345
Look what we found.

01:13:13.519 --> 01:13:14.825
Hey, roomie!

01:13:14.999 --> 01:13:16.957
Anemone. You'’re okay.

01:13:17.131 --> 01:13:20.134
It is good to see you
out of the house, Armen.

01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:21.919
It'’s good to be out.

01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:23.790
Any shells left?

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.662
Anybody?

01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:29.535
It'’s time, Armen.

01:13:30.318 --> 01:13:31.755
You sure about this?

01:13:31.929 --> 01:13:34.322
Oh, 100%.

01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:36.499
