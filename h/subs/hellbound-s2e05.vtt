WEBVTT

01:10.111 --> 01:11.321
Good to see you, Sungjip.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.285
I was surprised to get a call from you.
What's the occasion?

01:19.079 --> 01:21.289
What, we can't even call each other now?

01:21.956 --> 01:24.667
When you were on our campaign team,

01:24.751 --> 01:27.587
we used to talk on the phone every day,
didn't we?

01:29.172 --> 01:32.759
This used to be
such a nice place, didn't it?

01:35.136 --> 01:36.346
But look at it now.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.141
Those damn Arrowhead fanatics.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.560
Can we cut to the chase?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.689
All those years at Sodo
seem to have made you

01:47.899 --> 01:49.692
quite harsh.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.864
How is your tae kwon do center doing?
And are your kids well?

01:54.948 --> 01:57.575
You didn't call me here to ask me that.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.414
How should I put this in simple words?

02:09.671 --> 02:10.713
I want you

02:12.340 --> 02:14.134
to kidnap Park Jungja.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.851
Isn't the government working with
the New Truth on matters involving her?

02:24.394 --> 02:25.311
That's right.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.814
The Arrowhead has attained greater power,

02:27.897 --> 02:31.901
so our plan was to return some of it
to the New Truth.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.529
But then we realized

02:35.613 --> 02:38.241
we shouldn't give the New Truth
all that power.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.493
What do you mean?

02:42.287 --> 02:45.623
See? I told you it wasn't a simple matter.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.334
Listen.

02:50.086 --> 02:53.715
If the New Truth announces
a new doctrine through Park Jungja,

02:53.798 --> 02:57.343
all the attention will be on them.

02:57.427 --> 03:01.514
In the meantime,
we'll weaken the Arrowhead's power.

03:02.265 --> 03:07.228
If they make one final effort to resist,
we could wipe them out all at once.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.232
So why do you want us
to kidnap Park Jungja?

03:13.026 --> 03:15.904
Park Jungja is the protagonist.

03:17.530 --> 03:21.576
She's not some abstract concept
or doctrine.

03:21.659 --> 03:25.538
She's a person of flesh and blood,
just like us.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.834
She was the protagonist

03:30.335 --> 03:32.670
in the first chapter that shook the world.

03:32.754 --> 03:38.384
Now she's the protagonist in the story
of restoring order to the world.

03:39.469 --> 03:44.098
A story with such a strong character
doesn't fall apart easily,

03:44.182 --> 03:48.186
which means the New Truth's power
will keep growing indefinitely

03:48.269 --> 03:50.438
as long as they have Park Jungja.

03:51.981 --> 03:55.777
But if Sodo takes her away from them,

03:56.444 --> 04:01.157
Sodo will physically have Park Jungja,
and the New Truth will have her influence.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.533
That's how

04:03.660 --> 04:05.495
you would share her. It's beautiful.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.093
Why do you make things so difficult?

04:21.636 --> 04:23.763
The government
should just take Park Jungja

04:23.846 --> 04:27.558
and announce that these phenomena
aren't related to human behavior.

04:27.642 --> 04:31.562
The president must be quite determined
if you're planning something like this!

04:36.526 --> 04:40.488
You're still as naive as ever, Sungjip.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.201
Sungjip.

04:47.328 --> 04:52.041
What do you think people have craved most
in the history of humanity?

04:52.125 --> 04:52.959
Any ideas?

04:59.882 --> 05:03.386
It's God's punishment that can be seen…

05:07.056 --> 05:08.433
in the real world.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.646
Witnessing villains crying in fear,

05:13.730 --> 05:17.400
confessing and repenting their sins,
and getting torn apart…

05:18.776 --> 05:23.281
People have already tasted the pleasure
of seeing those things,

05:23.906 --> 05:27.160
and you want the government
to take that away from them?

05:28.619 --> 05:31.539
There will be a significant aversion
to public authority.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.752
So what is it that you want?

05:37.587 --> 05:41.215
The thing about people is
that when one idea starts dominating,

05:41.299 --> 05:44.677
they are bound to feel
an urge to oppose it.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.722
If we fail to keep
those urges under control,

05:47.805 --> 05:52.018
terrorist groups like the Arrowhead
will spring up everywhere.

05:55.396 --> 05:56.773
So what we want

05:58.066 --> 06:02.528
is a world where two opposing ideologies,
ones we can regulate,

06:04.280 --> 06:07.075
are locked in an endless battle.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.827
A world that we can control,

06:10.328 --> 06:12.997
yet one that still grants people
some level of freedom

06:13.081 --> 06:17.210
to express themselves,
follow their passions, and so on.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.380
A world with order, you know.

06:30.556 --> 06:34.352
We didn't make all those sacrifices
to pass down that kind of world.

06:36.771 --> 06:42.235
It seems you're no longer
the woman of principle I once worked for.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.529
I'm going to go now.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.075
Pass down what?

06:53.037 --> 06:53.871
Look.

06:54.705 --> 06:58.626
The world is already ruined.
What will be left to pass down?

06:58.709 --> 07:00.920
Hey, Sungjip. Kim Sungjip!

07:01.712 --> 07:05.091
Even if the world turns
into a fucking hell,

07:05.174 --> 07:08.136
we still need a system to sustain it!

07:09.262 --> 07:12.432
That's the best world
you could possibly create for your kids.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.516
Do you hear me?

07:21.691 --> 07:24.694
Even if we kidnapped Park Jungja,
we wouldn't be able to keep her.

07:26.404 --> 07:28.156
Why? Because of Min Hyejin?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.742
She will try to take her to her family.

07:37.165 --> 07:37.999
I know.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.460
I used to like her, you know.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.006
I even wanted her to represent our party.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.928
But that was back in the good old days.
Things are different now.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.143
Min Hyejin has nothing to lose
except her principles.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.061
But we are different.

07:59.979 --> 08:04.525
You and I still have
a lot of people we cannot lose.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.068
<i>Don't you think?</i>

08:07.695 --> 08:10.573
Your plan was to involve
someone who received a decree?

08:12.825 --> 08:14.160
All right, let's move!

08:42.021 --> 08:44.815
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

08:50.613 --> 08:52.490
Move! No, get off me!

08:56.285 --> 08:58.913
No! Get off me!

08:58.996 --> 09:00.456
I confess my sins!

09:00.540 --> 09:02.375
Let me join the demonstration!

09:03.417 --> 09:04.835
Let me join too!

09:05.378 --> 09:07.004
I confess my sins!

09:13.594 --> 09:17.557
The Sodo people are making their way
into the underground passage we secured.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.394
More policemen were dispatched
as a precaution against potential riots.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.398
Things are moving quicker than expected
but within our forecast.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.734
The Resurrected One and Chairman Kim
safely left the scene.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.237
All stations have started reporting
on the incident,

09:31.320 --> 09:34.574
and NTBC is preparing
extensive special coverage.

09:36.450 --> 09:38.786
Where are the Sodo people right now?

09:39.870 --> 09:42.039
They entered Building A
via the exit on the west side.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.210
The exit on the west side of Building A.

09:47.795 --> 09:50.047
I see. All right, good.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.426
Ms. Lee.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.054
Pinwheel started streaming secretly
ten minutes ago.

09:57.555 --> 10:00.224
He's telling the Arrowhead
to enter the main building.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.892
I'll share it on the screen.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.898
<i>Hurry! Come to the main building now!</i>

10:08.858 --> 10:11.193
<i>Today is gonna be one heck of a day.</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:12.695
<i>Please hurry!</i>

10:14.822 --> 10:17.867
- To the main building!
- Let's go!

10:18.659 --> 10:20.244
Pinwheel is calling us!

10:47.772 --> 10:50.691
WHY IS THE ARROWHEAD GATHERING
AT THE NEW TRUTH'S MAIN BUILDING?

10:55.404 --> 10:58.199
They must think law enforcement is a joke.

11:00.576 --> 11:02.328
Who do they think they are?

11:04.080 --> 11:05.247
Charge!

11:11.879 --> 11:13.839
Gather around, everyone!

11:16.258 --> 11:17.259
I should…

11:19.679 --> 11:21.305
appear sooner than planned.

11:21.847 --> 11:22.682
Yes, sir.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
A message from Chairman Jung.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.311
<i>He wants to appear sooner than planned.</i>

11:27.395 --> 11:28.229
Okay, got it.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.356
As promised,

11:30.439 --> 11:32.983
we'll take our first step
towards the new beginning

11:33.484 --> 11:36.362
and make a big announcement!

11:37.863 --> 11:40.366
THE CHAIRMAN WANTS TO APPEAR EARLIER

11:41.200 --> 11:42.284
Before we do that,

11:43.577 --> 11:46.414
we need to capture
Kim Jeongchil and Park Jungja.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.873
Fellow members!

11:48.708 --> 11:49.917
We need your help!

11:50.000 --> 11:52.586
Show them what we got!

11:53.087 --> 11:54.046
Cut!

11:56.841 --> 11:58.008
Hey, get me some water.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.305
Chairman Jung, we've found a better place.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.223
Let's go.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.642
All right, let's go!

12:18.863 --> 12:21.031
Mr. Jeong,
is your demonstration in an hour?

12:25.035 --> 12:26.078
In about 56 minutes.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.582
In area A18,
first floor of the outdoor parking lot,

12:29.665 --> 12:31.041
there's a black van.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.293
The key's inside.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.336
The license plate is 3081.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.381
We must rescue Ms. Park
and get to the van in 56 minutes.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.301
Mr. Jeong here will help us escape.

12:41.177 --> 12:43.596
What the hell are you doing now?

12:43.679 --> 12:46.056
Are you using the demonstration subjects?

12:46.974 --> 12:49.310
Isn't rescuing Ms. Park our priority?

12:49.810 --> 12:52.980
Branch leaders wouldn't have agreed
if it weren't for this plan.

12:54.732 --> 12:55.608
Ms. Min.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.153
It's not true at all
that we're being used.

12:59.236 --> 13:02.364
Both Ms. Lee and I agreed to do this.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.826
Please fix this world.

13:07.036 --> 13:10.414
Please don't let our deaths be in vain.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.292
Please.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.505
Ms. Min and I will go rescue Ms. Park.

13:18.005 --> 13:20.674
Mr. Jeong, please stand by in the van.

13:20.758 --> 13:21.592
Okay.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.011
Where is she right now?

13:24.094 --> 13:26.096
Our informant will let us know soon.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.057
Mr. Jeong, you should go ahead.

13:28.140 --> 13:28.974
Okay.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.902
Many people got caught and hurt
in the demonstration.

13:40.402 --> 13:42.905
You'll have to answer for that
when this is over.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.326
I just hope we make it out alive.

13:58.754 --> 13:59.588
Push through!

13:59.672 --> 14:00.840
Make way!

14:00.923 --> 14:01.841
Out of the way!

14:01.924 --> 14:03.259
You bastards!

14:12.309 --> 14:14.812
Stop them. Stop them at any cost!

14:15.312 --> 14:16.272
Sir.

14:17.273 --> 14:20.526
The Arrowhead members
are charging into the main building.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.362
That's…

14:27.324 --> 14:30.786
CULT LEADER

14:35.124 --> 14:36.166
Hello?

14:36.250 --> 14:39.420
Ms. Lee. The Arrowhead is causing havoc.
Please get us out of here.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.422
<i>Right, please calm down first.</i>

14:41.505 --> 14:43.632
We're fully aware of the situation.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.885
We've got a SWAT team nearby.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.596
They'll enter the main building soon.

14:48.679 --> 14:53.684
What's important is that you don't let
the Arrowhead take Park Jungja.

14:54.268 --> 14:58.022
Do you think we want that?
Things are getting out of hand here!

14:58.814 --> 15:00.232
I told you to calm down.

15:01.692 --> 15:02.693
Where are you?

15:02.776 --> 15:04.820
- Where are we?
- Second floor, Building C.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.071
Second floor, Building C.

15:06.155 --> 15:09.116
Pinwheel is now heading
to the first floor of Building A.

15:12.286 --> 15:13.329
Listen carefully.

15:14.330 --> 15:15.289
Head to…

15:17.499 --> 15:19.001
the third floor of Building B.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.087
<i>- Third floor, Building B?</i>
- Yes, go to the end of the hall.

15:22.171 --> 15:25.257
We'll send in a rescue team soon.
Do you understand?

15:25.341 --> 15:26.634
All right, fine.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.511
A rescue team, a SWAT team, or whatever.
Send them now! Fuck!

15:36.685 --> 15:37.978
Did he just say "fuck"?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.397
Yes, he said "fuck."

15:48.572 --> 15:51.784
Now, let's send Sodo over to them.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.507
3RD FLOOR OF BUILDING B, END OF THE HALL

16:08.133 --> 16:10.594
She is at the end
of the third-floor hall, Building B.

16:11.428 --> 16:12.262
Let's move.

16:18.102 --> 16:19.561
This is insane.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.563
Man, what is this place?

16:36.245 --> 16:37.329
What do you think?

16:38.414 --> 16:41.583
Isn't this the perfect place
to announce your return?

16:43.002 --> 16:44.378
This way, sir.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.975
All right, we're going live

16:58.058 --> 16:58.892
in five,

16:59.768 --> 17:00.602
four,

17:01.186 --> 17:02.438
three,

17:02.521 --> 17:03.355
two,

17:04.106 --> 17:04.940
one.

17:05.524 --> 17:06.400
All right!

17:06.483 --> 17:08.027
Let me ask you a question.

17:08.819 --> 17:12.448
Who do you think can cleanse the world
of chaos and sin

17:12.531 --> 17:14.116
and restore God's will?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.826
No one!

17:15.909 --> 17:17.119
Who?

17:18.328 --> 17:19.872
Who could it be? Who?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.000
Kim Jeongchil, the fraud?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.127
Of course not!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.714
Of course not!

17:31.508 --> 17:34.928
The man who first enlightened us
about God's will.

17:35.929 --> 17:39.558
<i>Our world needs him again right now!</i>

17:39.641 --> 17:40.976
<i>Right now, right here!</i>

17:43.145 --> 17:43.979
<i>Chairman Jung.</i>

17:45.147 --> 17:49.610
<i>Our one and only chairman has returned!</i>

17:54.239 --> 17:56.950
Chairman Jung Jinsu is back!

17:57.034 --> 18:00.204
Chairman Jung Jinsu is here right now!

18:00.287 --> 18:02.623
He's waiting for us!

18:02.706 --> 18:05.250
Listen to his words!

18:05.334 --> 18:07.628
Chairman Jung is back!

18:07.711 --> 18:10.422
Listen to his words!

18:10.923 --> 18:13.175
He's back! Chairman Jung is back!

18:14.218 --> 18:15.052
Sir.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.973
Jung Jinsu, the former chairman,
has shown up.

18:21.350 --> 18:25.062
<i>Right now, I'm standing</i>
<i>at the center of the New Truth.</i>

18:27.272 --> 18:29.233
<i>Even when the current New Truth</i>

18:29.858 --> 18:32.194
<i>led you astray</i>
<i>with false teachings of God's will,</i>

18:33.487 --> 18:36.990
<i>I kept my faith and waited for them</i>
<i>to return to their rightful duties.</i>

18:38.951 --> 18:39.827
However…

18:42.287 --> 18:44.706
I couldn't sit back and watch them

18:45.749 --> 18:48.043
distort God's new message,
the resurrection,

18:49.128 --> 18:50.963
for their own selfish interests.

18:51.755 --> 18:52.589
That's why

18:53.799 --> 18:54.967
I have returned.

18:56.218 --> 18:59.888
Everyone, I would like to meet
Ms. Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.225
And just like I did eight years ago,

19:04.184 --> 19:09.898
I wish to present you
with the new, true will of God.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.443
I sincerely ask you.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.738
Please…

19:18.866 --> 19:20.284
let me meet Park Jungja.

19:22.035 --> 19:24.746
Chairman Jung wants to meet
the Resurrected One!

19:24.830 --> 19:26.415
Push through!

19:40.596 --> 19:42.097
To the chairman's office!

19:45.767 --> 19:47.269
Capture Kim Jeongchil!

19:57.696 --> 19:59.656
JUNG IS IN THE MAIN BUILDING
WITH THE ARROWHEAD

20:02.326 --> 20:03.160
What is it?

20:03.243 --> 20:05.120
Jung Jinsu is here.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.038
What?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.124
Kim Jeongchil!

20:09.208 --> 20:10.459
Where are you hiding?

20:14.171 --> 20:17.132
Chairman Jung wants to meet
the Resurrected One!

20:17.216 --> 20:18.258
Search everywhere!

20:19.259 --> 20:20.969
Building B is just around the corner.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.900
KIM SUJEONG
DEMONSTRATION DATE: 8.1.2024

20:34.983 --> 20:36.443
SINS: GROUP ASSAULT, ABETTING MURDER

20:44.409 --> 20:47.079
Jung is looking for Ms. Park Jungja.
We must hurry.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.420
Get him!

20:57.130 --> 20:58.298
It's Min Hyejin!

20:58.382 --> 20:59.466
Let everyone know!

21:16.817 --> 21:17.776
Get them!

22:03.113 --> 22:04.156
Are you all right?

22:38.982 --> 22:39.816
What was that?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.401
What was that gunshot?

22:41.902 --> 22:43.987
Min Hyejin showed up on the third floor.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.783
Min Hyejin, that bitch.
She always gets in our way.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.755
Where's the end of the hall?

23:01.838 --> 23:02.798
Come this way.

23:11.973 --> 23:12.891
What the hell?

23:16.019 --> 23:19.147
- Are you sure those lunatics aren't here?
- I'm not too sure.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.816
But I think so.

23:20.899 --> 23:21.775
Go check.

23:21.858 --> 23:22.692
Me?

23:23.819 --> 23:25.445
Go, you dumbass!

23:25.529 --> 23:26.363
Yes, sir.

23:35.622 --> 23:36.456
The world…

23:36.540 --> 23:37.749
What's wrong with her?

23:38.750 --> 23:40.168
She's been like that for a bit.

23:40.752 --> 23:43.255
- What's she saying?
- Something about the world ending.

23:44.047 --> 23:46.508
That goddamn nutcase! For fuck's sake.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.386
Sir, we should move quickly now.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.971
Come on, let's go.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.934
The world…

24:09.781 --> 24:10.782
Who are you?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.159
Hurry. Get down there.

24:14.995 --> 24:16.037
We asked a question.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.790
Who are you? Are you a deacon?

24:19.291 --> 24:21.418
No, I'm just…

24:21.918 --> 24:23.837
I'm just a janitor here.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.672
- Janitor?
- Yes.

24:25.755 --> 24:28.258
- Should we let him go?
- Hang on. Let me ask first.

24:29.885 --> 24:32.929
We've got someone here.
He says he's a janitor.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.139
A janitor?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.100
How old does he look?

24:38.101 --> 24:40.770
Shit, he's an old man. Just let him go.

24:41.855 --> 24:42.981
Wait.

24:43.773 --> 24:44.608
Yes, sir?

24:46.443 --> 24:47.277
Tell them…

24:49.279 --> 24:50.614
to search the man.

24:51.948 --> 24:52.782
Yes, sir.

24:55.285 --> 24:57.913
Hey, search him just to be sure.

25:00.081 --> 25:00.916
Okay.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.084
Hey, grab him.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.172
Stay still.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.759
I don't have anything.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.220
Wait, that's…

25:17.724 --> 25:18.808
What's the timer for?

25:21.394 --> 25:23.021
That's when I get off work.

25:24.272 --> 25:25.190
Timer?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.692
He set a timer?

25:28.902 --> 25:30.362
He must've received a decree.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.072
Sorry?

25:32.697 --> 25:33.532
"A decree"?

25:33.615 --> 25:36.493
Sodo is using sinners right now.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.120
How much time is left on his timer?

25:40.497 --> 25:41.831
How much time is left?

25:43.208 --> 25:44.668
About 42 minutes.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.462
The demonstration is in 42 minutes.

25:48.672 --> 25:51.007
That's when they will take Park Jungja.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.760
Tell them to bring him here.

25:53.843 --> 25:54.928
Yes, sir.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.807
Hey, bring him here right now.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.433
<i>That bastard is from Sodo.</i>

26:01.935 --> 26:02.769
Hey.

26:03.353 --> 26:04.187
He is from Sodo.

26:09.818 --> 26:10.652
Let's go!

26:16.449 --> 26:17.993
Have you located Park Jungja yet?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.870
No. We have members
searching for her everywhere.

26:30.422 --> 26:32.173
The public's reaction

26:33.258 --> 26:35.635
to Jung Jinsu's appearance
is quite concerning.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.388
The police command is failing,

26:38.471 --> 26:40.974
and civilians are in the way
of the riot police.

26:41.558 --> 26:45.854
It would be difficult
to arrest Jung Jinsu in public.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.648
At this point,

26:49.941 --> 26:52.152
taking strong measures
against the Arrowhead

26:52.986 --> 26:54.946
would negatively affect public opinion.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.159
We should halt the operation

26:59.242 --> 27:03.038
and call it a conflict between Sodo,
the New Truth, and the Arrowhead.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.383
Not yet.

27:20.263 --> 27:24.893
We just need to get Park Jungja out.
We can deal with the rest once she's out.

27:26.728 --> 27:29.147
Third floor, end of the hall!

27:29.230 --> 27:30.148
Where are they?

27:30.940 --> 27:33.360
Where are they? Where's the rescue team?

27:33.443 --> 27:36.321
- Where's the rescue team?
- I'll look for them, sir!

27:36.404 --> 27:38.031
Where the fuck are they?

27:38.114 --> 27:39.491
Where's Kim Jeongchil?

27:39.574 --> 27:40.450
Where is he?

27:40.533 --> 27:42.077
That's Kim Jeongchil over there!

27:42.160 --> 27:43.662
- Come on, hurry!
- Come on!

27:45.121 --> 27:46.247
Close the door now!

27:48.917 --> 27:51.336
- The Resurrected One is here!
- Stop them!

27:55.131 --> 27:56.966
Fuck. Get her!

27:57.050 --> 27:58.510
Don't let her get away!

27:59.469 --> 28:01.930
- We found the Resurrected One.
- Okay.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.349
Chairman Jung, we're going back live.

28:04.432 --> 28:05.684
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

28:05.767 --> 28:06.685
Let's move out!

28:18.780 --> 28:20.573
Hey! You crazy bitch!

28:23.410 --> 28:25.537
We're doing all this crap because of you!

28:27.288 --> 28:28.540
Don't try too hard.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.625
What?

28:30.709 --> 28:34.504
The world is already over anyway!

28:38.550 --> 28:39.592
That crazy bitch!

28:43.388 --> 28:45.473
Ms. Park Jungja. Are you all right?

28:46.683 --> 28:48.059
Min Hyejin, you fucking bitch.

28:48.143 --> 28:51.730
I should've killed you myself
instead of leaving it to the Arrowhead.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.737
- He went that way! Get him!
- That way!

29:02.741 --> 29:05.368
This time,
I'll leave you with the Arrowhead.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.036
What?

29:07.120 --> 29:08.580
It's Kim Jeongchil!

29:12.208 --> 29:13.460
Min Hyejin is over there!

29:14.210 --> 29:15.044
Get him!

29:15.920 --> 29:16.755
There she is!

29:16.838 --> 29:17.714
Go on ahead!

29:39.694 --> 29:40.528
Pick up!

29:41.780 --> 29:43.239
Hello?

29:43.323 --> 29:45.408
The rescue team! Where's the rescue team?

29:45.492 --> 29:46.868
Chairman Kim Jeongchil.

29:47.952 --> 29:48.953
Where's Park Jungja?

29:49.037 --> 29:50.789
<i>I don't fucking know!</i>

29:50.872 --> 29:52.415
<i>Min Hyejin took her.</i>

29:52.499 --> 29:54.542
<i>Just forget her and get me out, okay?</i>

30:02.091 --> 30:06.513
How influential is Kim Jeongchil
within the New Truth?

30:07.096 --> 30:09.641
He doesn't have much influence on his own.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.937
Adviser Ju Cheolhwan wields influence
within the organization.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.440
And Vice Chairwoman Geum Yeongsuk
has a prominent public presence.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.151
He's certainly replaceable.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.617
CULT LEADER

30:36.417 --> 30:38.461
All right. That's good.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.090
Pick up. Come on, pick up!

30:54.310 --> 30:56.229
The man who betrayed God's will!

30:58.273 --> 30:59.107
Kim Jeongchil!

31:02.610 --> 31:06.114
Stop tainting God's will
and confess your sins to Him!

31:08.741 --> 31:10.493
You goddamn cult fanatics.

31:10.994 --> 31:13.162
What would you know about God's will?

31:13.913 --> 31:16.499
I'm the chairman of the New Truth!

31:17.083 --> 31:19.168
I'm the appointed messenger of God!

31:21.337 --> 31:25.049
That's not your fucking place,
you motherfucker!

31:37.145 --> 31:37.979
Jung Jinsu.

31:40.565 --> 31:41.733
Chairman Kim Jeongchil.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.193
Where's Park Jungja?

31:45.236 --> 31:46.070
Jung Jinsu.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.907
Min Hyejin took her.

31:53.786 --> 31:55.330
Find Min Hyejin right now.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.499
Jung Jinsu!

31:58.583 --> 31:59.751
Help me!

32:00.752 --> 32:01.836
Hey!

32:02.587 --> 32:04.172
I know your secret.

32:04.672 --> 32:08.509
I can expose your secret
to the whole world if I want to, okay?

32:10.011 --> 32:10.845
Let go of him.

32:21.022 --> 32:22.190
Go ahead.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.359
What?

32:28.404 --> 32:29.948
Go ahead and say

32:31.282 --> 32:32.533
what you were gonna say.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.749
Jung Jinsu is a sinner!

32:41.376 --> 32:43.836
He received a decree 20 years ago!

32:52.971 --> 32:55.431
He was subjected to demonstration,
went to Hell, and…

33:01.604 --> 33:02.730
Is that all?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.650
For your last words?

33:15.910 --> 33:16.744
All right!

33:17.453 --> 33:21.249
We will now perform good deeds
to repent for your sins.

33:21.332 --> 33:22.500
Everyone!

33:22.583 --> 33:26.462
We're not at liberty
to turn a blind eye to evil!

33:28.631 --> 33:31.968
Everyone! Let's begin. Begin!

33:34.387 --> 33:35.930
Send him to Hell!

33:36.431 --> 33:37.682
Go to Hell!

33:41.310 --> 33:42.645
Punish him!

33:43.896 --> 33:45.648
Jeongchil, you need a good beating!

34:11.841 --> 34:13.092
So that was it.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.220
What Park Jungja was talking about.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.027
Kill him!

34:47.502 --> 34:49.712
Chairman Jung, are you all right?

34:52.507 --> 34:53.341
Sir.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.483
Ms. Park Jungja.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.944
Listen to me! Pull yourself together!

35:13.027 --> 35:15.488
Ms. Park Jungja! It's me, Min Hyejin.

35:21.953 --> 35:23.079
Your lawyer.

35:27.542 --> 35:28.793
Do you remember me?

35:35.591 --> 35:37.176
I'll take you to your children.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.977
The man I was with will be here shortly.
We'll go with him.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.239
Toys.

36:01.909 --> 36:03.619
Something like an elephant.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.039
Sorry?

36:08.916 --> 36:13.796
A place with toys
and something that looks like an elephant…

36:16.340 --> 36:17.300
That's…

36:20.469 --> 36:21.804
where you'll die.

38:55.916 --> 38:59.837
