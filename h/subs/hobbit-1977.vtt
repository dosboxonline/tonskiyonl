00:09.160 --> 00:13.330
In a hole in the ground
there lived a hobbit.

00:15.248 --> 00:19.585
Many ages ago, when this ancient
planet was not quite so ancient...

00:19.793 --> 00:22.671
...long before men
recorded his history...

00:22.879 --> 00:27.216
...there was the time of Middle Earth,
where men shared his days with...

00:27.425 --> 00:32.262
...elves, dwarves, wizards,
goblins, dragons and... hobbits.

00:33.013 --> 00:37.016
In the lands of Middle Earth,
in an area known as the Shire...

00:37.225 --> 00:39.643
...there was a village named
Hobbiton.

00:39.852 --> 00:43.688
There, in a hole in the ground
there lived a hobbit.

00:44.189 --> 00:46.607
Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,

00:46.816 --> 00:49.693
nor a dry, bare, sandy hole.

00:50.110 --> 00:54.406
It was a hobbit-hole,
and that means comfort.

01:10.919 --> 01:12.771
Bilbo Baggins?

01:13.139 --> 01:14.521
Ah, yes?

01:14.714 --> 01:17.842
- I'm looking to hire a burglar.
- Burglar?

01:18.050 --> 01:20.177
I'm afraid you've come
to the wrong place.

01:20.386 --> 01:24.639
You mean you do not wish
to share a grand adventure?

01:24.848 --> 01:28.267
Dear me, no.
We hobbits are plain quiet folk.

01:28.517 --> 01:30.936
Adventures make one late for dinner.

01:32.896 --> 01:35.773
Enough! I am Gandalf,

01:35.982 --> 01:39.652
and Gandalf means me!

01:41.278 --> 01:46.407
- Gandalf? Not the wondering wizard?
- The same!

01:47.158 --> 01:48.159
Listen.

02:06.466 --> 02:10.219
Thorin and company, at your service.

02:10.886 --> 02:12.679
Dwalin, Balin...

02:12.888 --> 02:14.556
...Kili, Fili...

02:14.764 --> 02:17.934
...Dori, Nori and Ori.

02:18.142 --> 02:21.061
Oin, sir, and Gloin, sir.

02:21.270 --> 02:23.939
Call him Bifur, and him, Bofur.

02:24.147 --> 02:28.442
And Bombur at your service.

02:28.651 --> 02:32.362
We are all at your service.

02:52.671 --> 02:55.673
What do these dwarves
want in Hobbiton?

02:55.924 --> 02:58.634
They've come for tea, and for supper...

02:58.843 --> 03:02.262
...and for you, Burglar Baggins!

03:21.445 --> 03:25.907
- There's a magic in that music.
- And it moves through me.

03:26.115 --> 03:31.370
- You feel the love of beautiful things.
- To go and see the great mountains...

03:31.578 --> 03:34.372
...and hear the pine-trees and waterfalls.

03:34.581 --> 03:37.333
To wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.

03:37.542 --> 03:38.918
Just once.

03:41.837 --> 03:45.215
Gandalf, dwarves and Burglar Baggins...

03:45.423 --> 03:47.592
What is this burglar business?

03:47.800 --> 03:51.220
If you prefer, you can say
"expert treasure-hunter".

03:51.428 --> 03:54.556
Well, yes, I do prefer that.

03:54.764 --> 03:57.934
We have met tonight,
in the house of our friend...

03:58.142 --> 04:00.436
...this most excellent hobbit.

04:00.644 --> 04:04.522
May the hair on his toes never fall out!

04:04.731 --> 04:06.065
Here, here!

04:06.357 --> 04:08.901
We shall soon start on our long journey.

04:09.110 --> 04:12.279
Our object is, I take it,
well known to us.

04:12.446 --> 04:13.530
All of us?

04:14.155 --> 04:16.656
It is not well known to me.

04:16.991 --> 04:21.536
Really? Then we must inform our burglar.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.998
We seek a treasure.

04:25.206 --> 04:28.417
That which is rightfully ours.

04:29.001 --> 04:30.753
Far off in the east...

04:30.961 --> 04:34.881
...beyond the Misty Mountains
and the dark forest of Mirkwood...

04:35.089 --> 04:39.593
...there you will find Lonely Mountain.

04:44.306 --> 04:47.683
Long ago, this was the home of my people...

04:47.892 --> 04:50.477
...and was ruled by my grandfather:

04:50.686 --> 04:53.813
King under the Mountain.

04:58.859 --> 05:01.820
The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,

05:02.029 --> 05:04.572
While hammers fell like ringing bells

05:04.781 --> 05:07.742
In places deep, where dark things sleep,

05:07.950 --> 05:11.370
In hollow halls beneath the fells.

05:13.330 --> 05:16.249
Goblets they carved there for themselves

05:16.457 --> 05:19.376
And harps of gold; where no man delves

05:19.585 --> 05:22.004
There lay they long, and many a song

05:22.212 --> 05:26.257
Was sung unheard by men or elves.

05:28.217 --> 05:30.719
For ancient king and elvish lord

05:30.928 --> 05:33.555
There many a gleaming golden hoard

05:33.763 --> 05:36.516
They shaped and wrought, and light they caught

05:36.682 --> 05:39.977
To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

05:41.979 --> 05:44.064
On silver necklaces they strung

05:44.272 --> 05:47.441
The flowering stars, on crowns they hung

05:47.650 --> 05:50.152
The dragon-fire, in twisted wire

05:50.361 --> 05:53.905
They meshed the light of moon and sun.

05:55.949 --> 06:00.703
Undoubtedly all this wealth was
what brought the dragon.

06:04.205 --> 06:08.626
The pines were roaring on the height,
The winds were moaning in the night.

06:08.834 --> 06:11.962
The fire was red, it flaming spread;

06:12.170 --> 06:15.507
The trees like torches blazed with light.

06:17.133 --> 06:20.803
And below us in the valley lay Dale...

06:21.011 --> 06:23.555
...the town of mortal men.

06:26.015 --> 06:31.103
The bells were ringing in the dale
And men looked up with faces pale;

06:31.311 --> 06:34.481
The dragon's ire more fierce than fire

06:34.689 --> 06:38.150
Laid low their towers and houses frail.

06:38.359 --> 06:40.778
The mountain smoked beneath the moon;

06:40.986 --> 06:43.947
The dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.

06:44.155 --> 06:47.116
They fled their hall to dying fall

06:47.325 --> 06:50.452
Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

07:05.423 --> 07:08.509
Curses to the dragon!
Curses to Smaug!

07:08.718 --> 07:11.595
He killed our men and stole our gold!

07:11.762 --> 07:14.472
Curses to the dragon Smaug!

07:14.681 --> 07:17.600
Is this the adventure you've planned for me?

07:17.767 --> 07:20.102
To help you recapture the gold?

07:20.311 --> 07:21.436
None other.

07:23.939 --> 07:26.941
There are thirteen of you. Very unlucky.

07:27.441 --> 07:30.152
Mr. Baggins will make it fourteen.

07:30.361 --> 07:33.280
A splendid lucky number you've found for us.

07:33.488 --> 07:37.074
No arguments. Let us have the contract.

07:38.492 --> 07:42.871
"To Burglar Baggins. Terms for your
professional services.

07:43.079 --> 07:47.291
One fourteenth of total profits,
travelling expenses guaranteed.

07:47.500 --> 07:52.295
Funeral expenses if necessary.
Sincerely, Thorin and company."

07:52.546 --> 07:56.549
- Funeral expenses?
- Do you find the terms acceptable?

07:56.758 --> 07:59.885
- Of course he does!
- But, but I...

08:00.219 --> 08:05.431
So, tomorrow begins your greatest adventure.

10:27.425 --> 10:30.302
No hat, no stick, no pipe.

10:30.511 --> 10:35.098
Not even a pocket-handkerchief.
How can one survive?

10:39.351 --> 10:43.522
- How did Gandalf get ahead of us, Bombur?
- He comes and goes at will.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.898
He is a wizard, you know.

10:50.277 --> 10:53.530
Oh, bother burgling and
everything to do with it.

10:54.697 --> 10:58.367
Always remember, Bilbo:
When your heart wants lifting...

10:58.576 --> 11:00.953
...think of pleasant things.

11:01.370 --> 11:04.622
Eggs and bacon. A good full pipe.

11:04.831 --> 11:09.126
My garden at twilight. Cakes...

11:12.462 --> 11:17.758
We'll camp here. Perhaps we can find
a dry patch to sleep on.

11:21.803 --> 11:24.723
Our lookout has spied something.

11:25.140 --> 11:28.225
Look. Trolls!

11:32.104 --> 11:34.731
Miserable, no good robbing trolls.

11:34.939 --> 11:36.858
Where the deuce is Gandalf?

11:37.066 --> 11:42.112
Left us again. Just when a wizard
would have been most useful.

11:42.321 --> 11:45.365
No matter. We have
an expert burglar with us.

11:45.573 --> 11:50.327
- What have trolls to do with burgling?
- We could use some of that meat they're cooking.

11:50.536 --> 11:55.331
- Oh, I say!
- Burglar, do your burgling!

11:56.124 --> 12:01.211
Blast!
Nothin' but mutton to eat!

12:01.420 --> 12:03.713
How I long...

12:03.922 --> 12:07.633
...for a bit of man flesh!

12:08.592 --> 12:11.845
Bacon and eggs. My fireplace. Hot chestnuts.

12:15.348 --> 12:19.768
- What the blazes?
- Help! Help! Let me down! Stop that! Stop that!

12:19.977 --> 12:22.270
What have we got here?

12:22.479 --> 12:26.482
Let's cook him and find out!

12:28.317 --> 12:31.320
He wouldn't make a mouthful.

12:32.571 --> 12:37.783
But maybe there's more where he came from.

12:38.034 --> 12:41.161
Dwarves! I'm done for. Done for it!

12:43.872 --> 12:45.999
Dwarves?

12:46.624 --> 12:48.793
Now that's a supper!

12:49.001 --> 12:51.878
Let's go get 'em all!

13:02.554 --> 13:05.723
Let's roast them.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.644
No, boil them, says I!

13:11.436 --> 13:14.397
It's to his own, boys!

13:14.564 --> 13:17.358
There's plenty for all.

13:17.567 --> 13:21.695
I likes mine raw.

13:29.743 --> 13:34.331
Dawn take you all, and be stone to you!

13:37.750 --> 13:39.418
The sun!

13:39.627 --> 13:41.628
Blast it!

13:41.837 --> 13:47.133
How did the morning come so soon?

13:47.883 --> 13:50.344
We're done for!

13:54.723 --> 13:55.765
Excellent.

13:58.476 --> 14:01.353
One moment.
One moment!

14:02.479 --> 14:06.774
Where's that bumbling burglar?
Lucky number, indeed!

14:06.983 --> 14:08.901
Over here!

14:09.110 --> 14:11.111
Come and see what I've found!

14:12.612 --> 14:15.448
Not bad, burglar,
for your first attempt.

14:15.865 --> 14:17.950
Oh, it was nothing, actually.

14:20.119 --> 14:23.580
We'll keep these.
Deucedly fine blades...

14:23.788 --> 14:26.290
...considering they
were made by trolls.

14:27.250 --> 14:30.210
They don't seem like
troll blades to me.

14:30.419 --> 14:32.379
Probably stolen.

14:32.838 --> 14:37.550
- See these strange runes?
- Whatever are runes?

14:37.758 --> 14:42.387
Ancient writing. Mine has
them too. Can you make them out?

14:43.221 --> 14:46.015
I am not familiar with these letters.

14:46.224 --> 14:49.977
Well, whoever made them,
we've got them now!

14:50.185 --> 14:53.897
Cover up the treasure, men.
We'll fetch it on our return.

14:56.649 --> 14:59.985
Take that, Smaug, you filthy worm!

15:00.194 --> 15:03.113
I see you've also claimed a sword.

15:04.239 --> 15:06.657
Yes. Just a dagger, actually.

15:06.866 --> 15:10.661
But for one of my size, it suffices.

15:24.172 --> 15:26.716
Hurry men, we must be on our way!

15:26.924 --> 15:29.051
- Hold!
- Hold?

15:29.260 --> 15:31.970
It is time for you to have this.

15:32.179 --> 15:34.514
And what may that be?

15:35.515 --> 15:38.059
This is a map of Lonely Mountain...

15:38.267 --> 15:42.312
presented to me one hundred
years ago by your father.

15:42.521 --> 15:46.232
What? Why did it not come
to me, the rightful heir?

15:46.441 --> 15:49.485
I've chosen my own time to hand it over.

15:49.985 --> 15:54.030
Oh, I do love maps.
I have quite a collection.

15:54.239 --> 15:57.992
Bah, I remember the Mountain
well enough without this!

15:58.200 --> 16:03.163
Indeed? And how do you intend
to enter Smaug's chambers?

16:03.371 --> 16:06.624
Through the main gate,
as a houseguest?

16:06.874 --> 16:10.085
You'd be ashes before
you took your seventh step.

16:10.294 --> 16:11.712
Oh, see, look!

16:12.546 --> 16:17.550
This hand points from these runes to...

16:17.758 --> 16:21.303
Bless my soul!
A secret entrance!

16:22.095 --> 16:26.599
- A hidden passage to the lower halls!
- Excellent, burglar!

16:26.808 --> 16:30.602
- I'm really quite good with maps.
- Let me see.

16:31.395 --> 16:33.897
Yes, quite correct.

16:34.105 --> 16:37.567
But has it remained
a secret all these years?

16:37.775 --> 16:40.944
It's too small for Smaug to use.

16:41.153 --> 16:46.449
And it's covered by a door made to look
exactly like the side of the mountain.

16:47.325 --> 16:51.453
Here is the key. Keep it safe.

16:52.162 --> 16:53.622
Oh, well of course I will!

16:53.830 --> 16:57.542
But... if the secret door
is hidden, how do we find it?

16:57.750 --> 17:01.378
- The map doesn't tell.
- It does and it doesn't.

17:03.088 --> 17:06.883
You will understand in time.

17:26.773 --> 17:30.361
Behold, at last, Rivendell!

17:30.569 --> 17:35.365
The hidden valley of the elves,
where Elrond dwells.

17:35.573 --> 17:37.950
Simply enchanting!

17:38.868 --> 17:41.203
- But we must be on.
- Pity.

17:41.411 --> 17:44.331
Elvish singing is not a thing to miss...

17:44.539 --> 17:49.084
...in June under
the stars. But...

18:14.314 --> 18:18.484
My dear Elrond,
your hospitality is magnificent.

18:18.651 --> 18:21.987
The food, the wine,
the stories, the music.

18:22.237 --> 18:24.739
Yes, but we've
much to accomplish.

18:24.948 --> 18:28.492
You promised to have a look-see
at these troll swords after our feast.

18:28.701 --> 18:30.661
Yes, yes, of course.

18:30.869 --> 18:34.664
Well first of all,
they're not troll-make.

18:34.873 --> 18:36.749
They must have been stolen.

18:37.250 --> 18:42.462
They were made for the goblin-wars.
This sword, Thorin, the runes name

18:42.671 --> 18:45.882
Orcrist, the Goblin-cleaver.

18:46.090 --> 18:50.969
- And mine?
- Glamdring, the Foe-hammer.

18:51.345 --> 18:55.056
- Keep them well.
- I will keep this in honour.

18:55.265 --> 18:58.684
- Now show me your map.
- I have it here.

19:02.020 --> 19:06.357
Something's strange. Let's see...

19:08.025 --> 19:09.860
Yes, indeed!

19:10.694 --> 19:14.489
There are moon-letters here! See?

19:14.697 --> 19:16.824
What are moon-letters?

19:17.033 --> 19:22.245
Runes that can only be seen
when the moon shines behind them.

19:22.454 --> 19:27.375
They give directions
for finding the secret door.

19:28.334 --> 19:33.296
"Stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks,

19:33.505 --> 19:36.215
...and the last light
of the setting sun...

19:36.507 --> 19:40.386
...will shine upon the keyhole."

19:50.394 --> 19:51.895
This way!

19:52.104 --> 19:55.815
Shelter!
A dry cave!

20:03.071 --> 20:07.366
Now, get some sleep, men.
We found the perfect place to camp.

20:23.755 --> 20:27.592
Dwarves have a strange
notion of perfection.

20:27.800 --> 20:29.635
And where's Gandalf?

20:29.843 --> 20:33.305
Gone again?
I wish I was a wizard!

20:36.057 --> 20:38.267
Hello! What's this?

20:42.437 --> 20:44.272
Look out!

20:47.024 --> 20:48.943
The ponies! The ponies!

20:52.446 --> 20:54.614
Wake up! We've been robbed!

20:57.617 --> 20:59.577
The goblins are upon us!

20:59.785 --> 21:02.412
Save the ponies from the goblins!

21:12.546 --> 21:15.590
Trapped!
The goblins have us!

21:56.582 --> 22:00.586
Who are these miserable persons?

22:00.794 --> 22:04.381
Thorin, at your service.
We did not mean to trespass.

22:04.589 --> 22:07.633
We were merely seeking
shelter from the storm.

22:07.842 --> 22:11.178
He is a liar, oh,
truly tremendous one.

22:11.345 --> 22:14.431
Ask him to explain his weapon!

22:14.639 --> 22:19.018
This sword is named Orcrist,
the Goblin-cleaver!

22:22.187 --> 22:23.563
Murderers!

22:23.772 --> 22:25.273
Elf-friends!

22:28.234 --> 22:29.818
Stop!

22:46.040 --> 22:48.250
I know that sword!

22:48.626 --> 22:53.964
It is called Glamdring,
the Foe-hammer!

23:02.764 --> 23:05.725
Gandalf! Good old Gandalf!

23:05.892 --> 23:08.185
Follow me! Quickly!

23:12.856 --> 23:15.608
Through here! Follow me!

23:31.955 --> 23:33.081
Bilbo!

23:33.623 --> 23:35.583
He's gone!

23:46.727 --> 23:50.795
Bilbo, where are you?

24:01.671 --> 24:04.882
My precious.

24:05.090 --> 24:07.509
It is my precious.

24:09.052 --> 24:12.555
Hello, my precious.

24:13.681 --> 24:15.599
Bless us and splash us.

24:15.808 --> 24:19.060
Food for my precious.

24:19.269 --> 24:21.771
Eggs and bacon.
Spoons all polished.

24:21.979 --> 24:24.815
Warm muffins and sweet butter.

24:26.442 --> 24:29.861
What is that noise, my precious?

24:30.528 --> 24:33.989
My precious does not know.

24:40.412 --> 24:42.246
Bless my soul!

24:46.583 --> 24:48.793
Hello, what's this?

24:53.881 --> 24:59.010
Hmm, nice souvenir to show the neighbours
back home. If I ever get home.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.224
Oh, who are you?

25:05.724 --> 25:07.809
Bless us, my precious.

25:08.018 --> 25:13.356
A tasty morsel it would make us.

25:14.523 --> 25:18.527
What is it, my precious?

25:18.735 --> 25:20.361
I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins.

25:20.570 --> 25:24.740
I've lost my dwarves,
my wizard, and my way.

25:26.450 --> 25:29.244
Mind you, I'm armed
with an elvish blade!

25:32.121 --> 25:36.291
That's better.
Perhaps you know the way out?

25:38.877 --> 25:41.754
But perhaps we sits here...

25:41.921 --> 25:45.674
...and chats with it
a bitsy, my precious.

25:46.550 --> 25:50.095
It... likes... riddles?

25:50.929 --> 25:52.555
Do I like riddles?

25:52.763 --> 25:55.599
Well, yes, after a fashion.

25:56.600 --> 25:59.227
It must have
a competition with us.

25:59.436 --> 26:04.106
If precious asks
and it doesn't answer...

26:06.817 --> 26:10.862
...we eats it, my preciousss.

26:11.279 --> 26:12.405
Oh, I say!

26:12.613 --> 26:15.157
But if it asks us...

26:15.366 --> 26:17.618
...and we doesn't answer...

26:18.035 --> 26:19.327
...then we...

26:19.536 --> 26:20.745
...shows it...

26:21.120 --> 26:23.456
...the way out!

26:24.081 --> 26:28.085
- It seems I have no choice.
- My precious...

26:28.293 --> 26:31.921
...we makes the first riddle.

26:32.296 --> 26:34.423
Voiceless it cries,

26:34.632 --> 26:36.467
Wingless flutters,

26:36.675 --> 26:38.718
Toothless bites,

26:38.927 --> 26:41.638
Mouthless mutters.

26:42.722 --> 26:44.098
Can it...

26:44.306 --> 26:45.766
...guess...

26:46.141 --> 26:47.809
...the answer?

26:48.518 --> 26:50.103
Half a moment.

26:51.646 --> 26:55.441
Is it nice, my precious?
Is it juicy?

26:55.649 --> 26:57.484
Gooey? Yucky?

26:57.651 --> 27:00.070
Is it scrumptious?

27:00.278 --> 27:02.405
If you please!

27:04.156 --> 27:06.575
Wind!
Wind is the answer!

27:08.493 --> 27:09.744
Now, my turn.

27:10.495 --> 27:13.956
A box without hinges, key, or lid,

27:14.165 --> 27:17.459
Yet golden treasure inside is hid.

27:18.001 --> 27:22.213
Let us give us
a chance, my precious.

27:26.341 --> 27:27.926
Eggs!

27:28.135 --> 27:30.637
Eggs, it is!

27:31.045 --> 27:32.630
Oh, bother!

28:07.826 --> 28:11.245
Us, now! Now, us, my precious.

28:11.412 --> 28:14.164
I'm aquiver with anticipation!

28:14.790 --> 28:16.208
Now...

28:17.167 --> 28:21.963
This thing all things devours:

28:22.171 --> 28:26.717
Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;

28:26.925 --> 28:30.386
Gnaws iron, bites steel;

28:30.595 --> 28:33.931
Grinds hard stones to meal;

28:34.139 --> 28:38.476
Slays king, ruins town,

28:38.685 --> 28:44.023
And beats high mountain down.

28:48.902 --> 28:50.987
Well, interesting.

28:51.195 --> 28:53.739
Yes, now, let me see.

28:54.156 --> 28:56.825
What does it answer?
What does it answer?

28:57.034 --> 28:59.077
Just a moment now!

29:01.162 --> 29:02.830
My precious...

29:03.039 --> 29:06.917
...will it taste delicious?

29:09.794 --> 29:11.629
Yes! It will!

29:11.796 --> 29:14.423
- Give me some time.
- What...

29:15.132 --> 29:18.385
What does it say?

29:18.593 --> 29:20.303
I said time! Time!

29:27.559 --> 29:29.602
Whatever is the matter?

29:29.811 --> 29:32.688
It guess!

29:32.897 --> 29:36.817
Time is the answer!

29:37.067 --> 29:38.610
It is?

29:40.194 --> 29:43.239
I knew it all along.
That's an old one.

29:43.447 --> 29:47.075
Well, fun's fun.
Now couldn't we get out of here?

29:47.102 --> 29:55.039
No! It's got to ask us another
riddle, my precious! Yes! Yesss!

29:55.332 --> 29:57.834
Oh, blast, I can't
think of another one.

29:58.043 --> 30:01.004
Ask! Ask!

30:01.629 --> 30:03.797
Oh, very well.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.926
- What have I got in my pocket?
- Not fair!

30:08.134 --> 30:10.428
Not fair to ask my precious...

30:10.637 --> 30:13.264
...what it's got in
its nassty...

30:13.472 --> 30:16.016
...little pocketses!

30:16.516 --> 30:18.643
I'm sorry. That's my riddle.

30:18.852 --> 30:23.147
If you can't guess it,
you lose, and show me out!

30:26.775 --> 30:29.694
Oh, my precious loses!

30:34.031 --> 30:35.908
But first...

30:36.116 --> 30:39.077
...my precious shows it...

30:39.285 --> 30:42.830
...his something pretty.

30:43.289 --> 30:48.210
- You wish to show me something?
- My birthday present.

30:52.838 --> 30:54.590
Wait! Where are you going?

30:54.965 --> 30:58.927
My precious finds a ring...

30:59.135 --> 31:01.721
...on his birthday...

31:01.929 --> 31:05.349
...long ago.

31:05.557 --> 31:08.977
A golden ring.

31:09.185 --> 31:13.689
A magic ring!

31:17.692 --> 31:22.071
We must get my precious' birthday
present from its hiding place.

31:29.661 --> 31:31.370
Now what?

31:31.829 --> 31:34.915
He'll never guess
my pocket contained this.

31:39.419 --> 31:41.170
Bless my soul!

31:44.757 --> 31:46.300
Where is it?
Where is it?

31:46.508 --> 31:50.595
My golden ring!
My magic ring!

31:51.095 --> 31:54.014
Lost, it is!

31:54.223 --> 31:56.308
Lost!

31:56.516 --> 31:58.226
Lost!

31:58.435 --> 32:02.938
Curse us and crush us!
My ring... lost!

32:07.943 --> 32:11.571
My precious remembers.

32:11.779 --> 32:14.615
He wears it before...

32:14.823 --> 32:17.868
...and he drops it on the shore!

32:18.076 --> 32:21.162
Curse it! Curse the Baggins!

32:21.370 --> 32:24.331
He found it! My ring!

32:24.540 --> 32:28.126
My birthday present!

32:31.963 --> 32:34.423
My, he does carry on?

32:39.344 --> 32:41.929
Bless my soul!

32:44.473 --> 32:45.766
The ring?

32:50.061 --> 32:52.313
Most definitely.

32:55.649 --> 32:59.486
My precious, we find it!
We find it! The Baggins.

32:59.652 --> 33:02.822
My precious will crush it...

33:03.030 --> 33:05.115
...and smash it!

33:05.491 --> 33:07.534
Better douse this.

33:11.996 --> 33:13.581
Where is it?

33:13.873 --> 33:15.707
Where is it?

33:18.168 --> 33:21.546
It is tricksy.

33:21.754 --> 33:25.883
It says it doesn't know
the way out...

33:26.091 --> 33:30.637
...but it knows a way in,
my precious.

33:31.179 --> 33:33.139
It must...

33:33.347 --> 33:36.642
...know a way out!

33:40.311 --> 33:42.438
It's off for the back door.

33:42.647 --> 33:46.942
My precious must make haste
to the back door.

33:47.150 --> 33:48.652
To the back door!

33:51.154 --> 33:52.488
How convenient.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.407
Well, follow the leader.

34:03.539 --> 34:06.041
It's not here, my precious.

34:06.250 --> 34:09.627
It's make an escape!

34:15.215 --> 34:17.134
Thief!

34:17.676 --> 34:19.135
Thief!

34:19.344 --> 34:20.844
Baggins!

34:21.054 --> 34:23.514
We hates it!

34:24.306 --> 34:28.226
Hates it forever!

34:32.897 --> 34:37.567
You see, Gollum thought I knew the
way out, and was trying to head me off.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.069
I merely followed him to the exit.

34:40.235 --> 34:43.739
We had to fight our way
through the goblin guard.

34:43.947 --> 34:47.034
- How is it they didn't see you?
- Oh, well...

34:47.242 --> 34:50.411
...the art of burgling is really,
you know...

34:50.620 --> 34:53.330
...the art of being unobtrusive.

34:53.746 --> 34:56.625
Invisible, so to speak.

34:56.833 --> 35:01.087
Your story, Bilbo, has the ring of truth.
Yes, it rings true.

35:02.088 --> 35:05.340
You need say no more.
We'd best get a move on.

35:05.549 --> 35:08.093
There are still goblins about.

35:08.510 --> 35:11.554
Oh, bother! More mountains?

35:11.555 --> 35:14.098
No. Don't you see?

35:14.306 --> 35:17.976
The sun is setting in the west,
behind the mountains.

35:18.184 --> 35:23.314
We are on the other side,
to the edge of the land beyond.

35:28.443 --> 35:31.737
- The Wargs!
- With the goblins!

36:38.251 --> 36:42.421
- Help!
- We can't go any higher!

37:13.198 --> 37:19.327
- Oh, my arms.
- My poor legs! My legs!

37:19.536 --> 37:24.790
But what will they do with us?
Drop us to our deaths?

37:24.998 --> 37:26.833
Who knows?

37:27.042 --> 37:31.254
But they've brought us a far
distance with no dropping!

37:31.462 --> 37:36.133
Behold! The river of Wilderland below!

37:36.341 --> 37:38.051
My thunder!

37:38.260 --> 37:43.055
They're taking us to the edge
of Mirkwood Forest...

37:43.222 --> 37:48.018
...to dash us against those rocks,
I know it!

37:58.943 --> 38:00.737
O great Lord of the Eagles...

38:00.945 --> 38:04.240
...we are eternally grateful
for your gallant rescue.

38:04.490 --> 38:06.533
I have not forgotten the arrow...

38:06.742 --> 38:10.078
...that brought me down
so many years ago.

38:10.245 --> 38:12.663
I have not forgotten the wizard...

38:12.872 --> 38:15.999
...who found me and healed my wound.

38:16.458 --> 38:17.667
And now...

38:18.251 --> 38:21.254
...farewell, wherever you fare...

38:21.462 --> 38:24.840
...till your aeries receive you
at the journey's end.

38:32.430 --> 38:35.974
So this is the forest of Mirkwood.

38:36.183 --> 38:40.019
Terrible place if I remember.
And dangerous.

38:40.395 --> 38:44.523
Now, now.
The map shows the safest path.

38:44.732 --> 38:47.734
Follow it closely,
straight through the forest.

38:47.943 --> 38:52.363
Don't stray off the track. If you do,
you will never get out of Mirkwood.

38:52.571 --> 38:55.449
You speak as if you
weren't going with us.

38:55.657 --> 38:59.536
I'm not. I have pressing
business away south.

39:00.161 --> 39:04.748
- Oh, no! He can't mean it!
- What will we do without Gandalf?

39:04.957 --> 39:06.875
Please, don't leave us.

39:07.084 --> 39:11.087
Now, now. I'm already late because
of bothering with you people.

39:11.295 --> 39:15.299
I'm sending Mr. Baggins with you.
That should be enough.

39:15.716 --> 39:17.926
- Mr. Baggins?
- Bilbo?

39:18.134 --> 39:19.260
The burglar?

39:19.552 --> 39:23.347
Me? I'm no equal to a wizard!

39:23.556 --> 39:26.892
Nonsense. You are the lucky number.

39:27.100 --> 39:31.771
And soon you'll find out there's
more about you than you guess.

39:44.156 --> 39:48.118
You, sir, will be my surrogate.
My replacement, so to say.

39:48.326 --> 39:52.788
Here is paper and a marker. Keep a strict
log of the remainder of your journey.

39:52.997 --> 39:57.417
...so I may study it when we meet again
and point out your missteps.

39:57.918 --> 39:59.836
I can only do my best.

40:00.378 --> 40:02.922
Then that will have to suffice.

40:16.642 --> 40:19.811
To Gandalf:
As per your instructions...

40:20.019 --> 40:24.273
...I am keeping this log of our
journey through Mirkwood forest.

40:24.565 --> 40:28.860
I shall make good use of it someday
as a basis for my memoirs.

40:29.069 --> 40:31.029
...which I intend to call:

40:31.195 --> 40:35.824
There and Back Again:
A Hobbit's Holiday.

41:00.637 --> 41:05.224
The days are terrible,
and the nights are impossible...

41:05.432 --> 41:07.726
...for we are hungry and thirsty.

41:08.059 --> 41:11.312
The berries which grow here are hideous.

41:14.064 --> 41:17.692
Everything about these woods
is unpleasant.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.654
One day we decided someone...

41:21.863 --> 41:25.741
...should climb to the top of the
tallest tree and have a look about.

41:26.241 --> 41:30.370
I couldn't argue. My contract
is vague on several points.

41:55.766 --> 41:57.100
There are moments...

41:57.267 --> 42:01.729
...which can change a person for all time.

42:02.021 --> 42:07.067
And I suddenly wondered if I would
ever see my snug hobbit hole again.

42:07.818 --> 42:11.362
I wondered if I actually wanted to.

42:25.958 --> 42:29.878
I awoke the next morning
to a hideous surprise.

42:50.436 --> 42:53.439
Now I will give you a name.

42:53.647 --> 42:57.776
And I shall call you Sting!

43:03.239 --> 43:06.825
The remainder of the morning
was spent in seeking my companions.

43:07.284 --> 43:12.880
And I found them, finally,
in a place as black and terrible...

43:12.888 --> 43:16.416
...as a patch of midnight that
had never been cleared away.

43:21.170 --> 43:23.881
They'll make fine eating...

43:24.506 --> 43:27.300
...when they've hung a bit!

43:33.431 --> 43:34.807
Go away!

43:35.057 --> 43:37.142
Go away!

43:37.517 --> 43:38.977
Bombur!

43:49.194 --> 43:53.030
I certainly could not let
my companions, my comrades...

43:53.239 --> 43:58.410
...become of meal for these hideous
spiders. Action was called for.

44:14.173 --> 44:18.551
Now you are all free. I know, the
spiders' poisons have made you weak,

44:18.760 --> 44:22.054
but you must follow me. Quickly!

44:26.933 --> 44:30.645
Look! On the path ahead! There it is.

44:30.853 --> 44:33.647
It has freed our supper!

44:34.064 --> 44:35.666
Now we see you!

44:36.275 --> 44:41.612
We will eat you and leave
your skin hanging in a tree.

44:42.988 --> 44:44.240
Grab it!

44:45.824 --> 44:49.577
I think I can hold them off!
Run to the Wood-elves' clearing!

44:49.744 --> 44:51.829
But, how can you...?

44:52.038 --> 44:54.707
I will do the stinging! Run.

44:55.165 --> 44:57.084
Swiftly now!

44:57.959 --> 45:02.588
We've got them now.
Close the circle.

45:02.797 --> 45:05.049
It can't escape us!

45:11.262 --> 45:14.056
Lazy Lob!
Attercop!

45:18.351 --> 45:21.896
Blast! What is it... called?

45:22.396 --> 45:26.149
Sting! Sting! Sting!

45:31.946 --> 45:37.117
Away! Retreat!
We are no match for Sting!

45:44.790 --> 45:48.335
I joined my companions at
the clearing of the Wood-elves.

45:48.543 --> 45:52.213
But when I found them,
I was in for another surprise.

45:52.797 --> 45:57.217
The Wood-elves had returned,
but armed for battle.

45:57.634 --> 46:01.429
The dwarves, weakened as they were
by the encounter with the spiders...

46:01.637 --> 46:03.264
...gave up without a struggle.

46:11.104 --> 46:13.355
We travelled all day and into the night.

46:13.564 --> 46:16.692
Finally, we came to the palace
of the Elf King...

46:16.900 --> 46:20.153
...which was of the very
eastern edge of the forest.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.780
We'd come all the way through...

46:22.988 --> 46:26.825
...only to end up as prisoners.

46:30.411 --> 46:33.831
- Why did you dwarves try to attack?
- No attack!

46:34.039 --> 46:37.125
We came to beg.
We were starving.

46:37.334 --> 46:40.211
And why were you in the forest
in the first place?

46:40.420 --> 46:43.172
- That is our business.
- Very well.

46:43.380 --> 46:47.050
Take them away until they
feel inclined to tell the truth...

46:47.259 --> 46:49.302
...even if they wait a hundred years!

46:49.969 --> 46:54.807
Greed. The fortune we were after
was big enough to share with the elves.

46:55.015 --> 47:00.186
They'd make valuable allies
against that old worm Smaug.

47:01.854 --> 47:07.192
Instead, they became the enemy,
and we were their prisoners.

47:09.944 --> 47:14.490
And even though my invisibility
allowed me to move about with ease...

47:14.698 --> 47:18.076
...I had no way of opening the locks.

47:18.285 --> 47:23.164
So it was weeks before I found
a way to free my companions.

47:24.415 --> 47:26.750
Part of the river flowed under the caves.

47:26.958 --> 47:30.420
Deliveries of fine wines were
brought up the river by human men...

47:30.628 --> 47:32.963
...who lived on Long Lake.

47:33.172 --> 47:37.676
Now Wood-elves enjoy their wine,
and the barrels were soon drained.

48:05.449 --> 48:07.367
Oh, stop complaining!

48:07.617 --> 48:11.829
I never promised to burgle you
first class accomodations.

48:26.758 --> 48:30.261
I'd come far, and through
many adventures to see it...

48:30.470 --> 48:34.932
...and now I did not like
the look of it at all!

48:41.229 --> 48:45.232
Within hours we'd reached the
colony of humans called Lake-town.

48:45.441 --> 48:47.943
A precise, if not too imaginative name...

48:48.151 --> 48:52.947
...for the village was actually
built on the surface of Long Lake.

48:55.908 --> 48:59.786
Here, the descendants of the men
of Dale still dared to dwell...

48:59.953 --> 49:05.249
...and do business in the shadow
of old Smaug's mountain.

49:12.838 --> 49:14.798
I am Thorin...

49:15.007 --> 49:18.468
...grandson of King under the Mountain!

49:18.677 --> 49:23.139
I have returned!

49:38.318 --> 49:40.570
Hail, Thorin Oakenshield.

49:40.778 --> 49:45.449
I am Bard the guardsman.
We are honoured by your presence.

49:45.657 --> 49:48.993
Your grandfather lives
in our songs and legends.

49:49.327 --> 49:53.664
What help we can offer will be yours,
and we trust to your gratitude...

49:54.206 --> 49:58.793
...when the dragon Smaug is killed
and your kingdom is regained.

50:08.218 --> 50:10.845
We were fed, fattened, given supplies...

50:11.054 --> 50:15.307
...and two weeks later found us
nearing the end of our journey.

50:15.516 --> 50:20.270
And chances were it would be
a very horrible end, indeed.

50:28.860 --> 50:33.656
That smell!
I've not smelled dragon before!

50:33.864 --> 50:39.077
All the halls within must be
filled with his foul reek.

50:41.954 --> 50:44.331
And while Smaug slept inside...

50:44.540 --> 50:49.502
...we spent our days searching
for that elusive secret door.

50:49.711 --> 50:52.213
Then, one afternoon...

50:52.713 --> 50:58.051
And so, Gandalf, while I wait,
I inscribe the final pages of your log.

51:00.887 --> 51:04.973
My only companion is an
annoying bird cracking snails.

51:06.308 --> 51:11.270
"Stand by the grey stone
when the thrush knocks...

51:11.479 --> 51:14.315
"...and the last light
of the setting sun...

51:14.523 --> 51:18.443
"...will shine upon the keyhole."

51:20.486 --> 51:22.822
Oh, my goodness!

51:23.406 --> 51:25.908
Wake up! Wake up! It's happening!

51:26.116 --> 51:27.701
By thunder!

51:32.705 --> 51:34.206
There it is!

51:39.961 --> 51:43.255
Thorin, before it's gone again,
use your key.

51:55.974 --> 51:58.268
Well, here we are.

52:00.103 --> 52:01.646
But what now?

52:01.854 --> 52:06.900
Now is the time for our esteemed
Mr. Baggins to perform the service...

52:07.109 --> 52:09.986
...for which he was included
in our company.

52:09.987 --> 52:10.686
Me?

52:10.695 --> 52:16.033
You must earn your reward.
We do have a contract.

52:16.241 --> 52:18.910
You think it's my job to go in first?

52:19.119 --> 52:23.873
I've already gotten you out of two
messes not in the original bargain.

52:24.290 --> 52:26.541
And who will come with me?

52:27.042 --> 52:28.752
Any of you?

52:29.294 --> 52:30.753
I see.

52:31.087 --> 52:33.756
Well, you are the burglar.

52:33.964 --> 52:36.675
Go down and burgle something.

52:36.883 --> 52:40.136
Very well. I won't refuse.

52:41.804 --> 52:42.930
Good luck.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.765
Thank you.

52:45.099 --> 52:48.977
I've begun to trust my luck
more than in the old days.

52:56.733 --> 53:00.528
Now, you're in for it at last, Bilbo Baggins.

53:00.737 --> 53:05.324
Why are you here? You've no use
for dragon treasures.

53:23.080 --> 53:26.291
Feel the worm's heat, Mr. Baggins?

53:26.500 --> 53:28.835
A few more steps and you shall see...

53:29.043 --> 53:32.463
...the old dragon Smaug at last.

53:37.467 --> 53:39.886
You can still turn back, you know.

53:40.053 --> 53:44.681
But to go on, to take those steps...

53:44.890 --> 53:48.726
...that would be the bravest
of all moments.

53:48.935 --> 53:52.229
Whatever happens afterwards is nothing.

53:53.272 --> 53:55.816
Yes, here is where you fight...

53:56.024 --> 53:59.861
...your real battle, Mr. Bilbo Baggins.

54:00.403 --> 54:02.196
Do you go back?

54:13.703 --> 54:15.199
No!

54:51.696 --> 54:53.447
Well, thief...

54:54.907 --> 54:58.451
...I smell you, feel your air.

54:59.535 --> 55:01.912
I hear your breath.

55:03.455 --> 55:04.998
Come along!

55:06.041 --> 55:10.211
Help yourself. There's plenty and to spare.

55:10.470 --> 55:14.965
Oh, thank you, O Smaug the Magnificent.

55:15.716 --> 55:19.802
I did not come for presents.
I only wish to have a look at you...

55:20.011 --> 55:23.639
...and see if you are truly
as great as tales say.

55:23.847 --> 55:26.058
I did not believe them.

55:27.934 --> 55:29.310
Do you now?

55:29.519 --> 55:33.022
They fall utterly short of reality...

55:33.230 --> 55:38.443
...O Smaug the Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities!

55:42.822 --> 55:46.491
You have nice manners for a thief...

55:46.700 --> 55:48.326
...and a liar.

55:50.244 --> 55:51.787
You know me...

55:53.247 --> 55:56.875
...but I don't remember smelling you before.

55:59.210 --> 56:03.172
Who are you and where do you come from?

56:03.922 --> 56:05.966
I come from under the hill.

56:06.174 --> 56:09.636
And under the hill and
over the hills my paths led.

56:09.844 --> 56:14.473
And through the air.
I am he that walks unseen.

56:14.932 --> 56:16.516
You make riddles?

56:18.601 --> 56:20.144
What is your name?

56:20.353 --> 56:25.274
I am the lucky number,
the web-cutter, the spider-stinger...

56:25.482 --> 56:26.983
Lovely titles.

56:27.192 --> 56:31.987
I am he that drowns his friends and
draws them alive again from the water.

56:32.196 --> 56:36.950
I am the guest of eagles,
the ring-winner and luck-wearer.

56:37.158 --> 56:40.244
...the clue-finder and the barrel-rider.

56:40.870 --> 56:42.496
Barrel-rider, eh?

56:43.914 --> 56:46.583
Then I have guessed your riddle!

56:47.375 --> 56:49.653
You are one of those miserable...

56:49.661 --> 56:52.379
...tub-trading Lake-men!

56:53.422 --> 56:58.343
You and your town shall pay
dearly for this intrusion!

57:00.344 --> 57:03.889
So the Lake-men would steal my treasure?

57:06.475 --> 57:10.812
Wait! You don't know everything.
Not gold alone brought me hither.

57:11.020 --> 57:13.272
Be done with your riddles!

57:14.231 --> 57:17.234
What else brought you, Lake-man?

57:19.611 --> 57:21.070
Revenge!

57:23.530 --> 57:25.365
Revenge?

57:25.699 --> 57:28.243
Surely you must realize
that your success...

57:28.451 --> 57:30.870
...has made you some bitter enemies.

57:43.422 --> 57:47.550
Revenge? You? Ha!

57:49.427 --> 57:53.180
I am Smaug!

57:54.681 --> 57:56.475
I kill what I wish!

57:57.892 --> 57:59.852
I am strong...

58:00.269 --> 58:01.771
...strong...

58:02.897 --> 58:04.314
...strong!

58:07.776 --> 58:10.778
My armor is like tenfold shields...

58:10.987 --> 58:13.280
...my teeth are like swords...

58:13.489 --> 58:15.949
...my claws, spears...

58:16.366 --> 58:18.326
...the shock of my tail...

58:18.660 --> 58:20.786
...a thunderbolt!

58:22.621 --> 58:24.415
My wings...

58:25.290 --> 58:27.751
...a hurricane!

58:34.882 --> 58:37.217
And my breath...

58:39.302 --> 58:40.595
...death!

58:42.972 --> 58:44.098
Well?

58:46.349 --> 58:47.809
Well?!

58:48.018 --> 58:51.103
Where are your riddles now?

58:52.229 --> 58:54.731
Very, very impressive.

58:54.940 --> 58:56.066
However...

58:56.858 --> 59:00.486
...I have always understood
that dragons were...

59:00.495 --> 59:03.947
...soft underneath. Vulnerable.

59:04.323 --> 59:07.784
Especially in the region of the chest.

59:07.992 --> 59:10.328
You have heard wrong!

59:11.120 --> 59:15.082
I am armoured both above and below.

59:15.749 --> 59:18.835
Well, I don't know about that.

59:19.043 --> 59:21.712
You "don't know about that."

59:22.421 --> 59:24.590
I shall show you!

59:27.008 --> 59:27.926
Look!

59:28.760 --> 59:31.178
What do you say to this?

59:32.179 --> 59:34.515
Rare and wonderful, eh?

59:37.183 --> 59:38.643
Dazzling!

59:38.852 --> 59:40.186
Marvellous!

59:40.394 --> 59:41.604
Perfect!

59:41.854 --> 59:42.897
Flawless!

59:43.105 --> 59:45.274
Staggering! Mag...

59:46.316 --> 59:48.234
Old fool!

59:48.443 --> 59:51.755
There is a patch in the hollow
of your left breast...

59:51.763 --> 59:55.866
...as bare as a snail out of its shell.

59:58.243 --> 59:59.160
What's that?

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.954
More riddles?

01:00:02.705 --> 01:00:04.832
No, my riddling is done.

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:09.877
I really must not detain
Your Magnificence any longer.

01:00:10.044 --> 01:00:15.007
Sorry you could not find me. But a
fine burglar takes expert catching.

01:00:17.509 --> 01:00:18.718
Burglar?

01:00:23.681 --> 01:00:27.475
Burglar!

01:00:31.812 --> 01:00:36.566
Thief! Fire! Murderer!

01:00:43.906 --> 01:00:47.367
- We should have gone with him!
- To be roasted alive?

01:00:47.575 --> 01:00:49.369
It's the burglar!

01:00:49.577 --> 01:00:52.371
Three cheers for good old Bilbo!

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:56.208
Thank you! But I'd appreciate
a more pragmatic salute.

01:00:56.416 --> 01:00:57.626
In other words...

01:00:57.834 --> 01:01:01.003
...extinguish me!

01:01:03.547 --> 01:01:07.175
There we go! There we go!
Always glad to help a friend.

01:01:07.384 --> 01:01:10.219
I can' tell you how grateful I am.

01:01:10.228 --> 01:01:13.264
Oh, never mind that. What did you burgle?

01:01:13.764 --> 01:01:15.098
This.

01:01:17.726 --> 01:01:18.893
What's that?

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:20.561
Earthquake?

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:55.716
Into the secret passage! Our only chance!

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:00.511
Barrel-rider!

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.305
Thieving Lake-man!

01:02:03.639 --> 01:02:08.309
Your people shall see my vengeance!

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.859
The lake people are doomed, unless...

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:22.488
Yes! You, who are a mere thrush,
and yet so much more.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:26.491
You have seen Smaug.
You know his vulnerable spot!

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.662
Go, now! To Lake-town!
There is a guardsman, Bard. Tell him!

01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:44.965
This breeze is strangely warm for autumn.

01:02:45.882 --> 01:02:47.467
Bard! What's that?

01:02:51.721 --> 01:02:54.389
The dragon is coming, or I'm a fool!

01:02:54.598 --> 01:02:58.351
Cut the bridges! To arms! To arms!

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:02.771
The dragon! Old Smaug!

01:03:03.188 --> 01:03:06.525
Awake after all these years!
The dragon is coming!

01:03:22.288 --> 01:03:25.123
Ready? As he passes over...

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:27.667
Arrows!

01:03:36.883 --> 01:03:38.676
Stand your ground. Rearm!

01:03:51.729 --> 01:03:54.398
Away, you fool bird! Away!

01:03:55.941 --> 01:03:57.067
You speak?

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.862
Bilbo Baggins?

01:04:01.070 --> 01:04:02.613
He found what?

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.574
Yes! I'll look!

01:04:09.577 --> 01:04:12.997
Jove! You speak the truth, old thrush!

01:04:15.332 --> 01:04:19.252
Black arrow, you've never failed me.
And I've always recovered you.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:22.546
I had you from my father,
and he from of old.

01:04:22.755 --> 01:04:26.716
If ever you came from the forges of
the true King under the Mountain...

01:04:26.925 --> 01:04:28.885
...go now and speed well!

01:05:02.038 --> 01:05:03.956
Now I am king!

01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:05.374
Stop!

01:05:05.791 --> 01:05:09.877
There is only one King under
the Mountain, and I am he...

01:05:10.086 --> 01:05:10.920
...Thorin!

01:05:11.128 --> 01:05:15.549
Hail Thorin!
Hip-hip-hooray!

01:05:16.508 --> 01:05:18.051
Now, now, there's...

01:05:18.802 --> 01:05:23.264
...much have be done.
We must catalog our wealth.

01:05:23.472 --> 01:05:26.600
Dear me! And pack it for shipment.

01:05:30.144 --> 01:05:33.314
Join the fun, burglar!
Part of this is yours!

01:05:33.731 --> 01:05:36.650
Might be mine!
What if Smaug returns?

01:05:36.817 --> 01:05:41.737
Aah, he's been gone for a week now.
Found greener pastures, no doubt.

01:05:41.946 --> 01:05:44.323
Has this wealth made you mad?

01:05:44.490 --> 01:05:47.200
We must find our way
out of this mountain...

01:05:47.409 --> 01:05:49.911
...and see for ourselves
if he's gone, and quickly!

01:05:50.495 --> 01:05:54.581
According to this map, the main gate
lies in this direction.

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:56.833
Follow me, gentlemen!

01:06:02.379 --> 01:06:03.922
Bless my soul!

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.632
What are they?

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:10.303
Is the entire valley floor
populated by giant fireflies?

01:06:10.511 --> 01:06:13.138
Not fireflies, fires! Campfires!

01:06:13.514 --> 01:06:16.641
Nonsense! Only an army would need
that many fires.

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:19.477
No, my friend. Two armies!

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:24.273
Bard of Lake-town? What did you say?

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:26.149
Two armies!

01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:31.362
Smaug is dead. I have slain him.
The thrush delivered your message.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:35.949
Really? Splendid news, old fellow!
I hoped he would!

01:06:36.158 --> 01:06:38.284
My people have made me king.

01:06:38.493 --> 01:06:41.495
King? Really? Congratulations!

01:06:41.704 --> 01:06:46.333
Couldn't happen to a nicer chap. Really!
I don't know how to thank you.

01:06:46.541 --> 01:06:49.294
Our town is destroyed and must be rebuilt.

01:06:49.502 --> 01:06:52.004
You can thank us by sharing your fortune.

01:06:52.213 --> 01:06:55.549
Why of course, of course.
There's plenty for all.

01:06:55.757 --> 01:07:00.344
Wait! The fortune is ours,
and belongs to dwarves alone!

01:07:00.553 --> 01:07:03.681
It wouldn't be yours if Smaug still lived.

01:07:03.889 --> 01:07:05.641
A technicality.

01:07:05.849 --> 01:07:10.561
- So you brought two armies to take it?
- I brought one army.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.396
The other is mine!

01:07:13.731 --> 01:07:16.149
You, who threw us into the dungeon?

01:07:16.358 --> 01:07:20.570
My people have suffered greatly
from the worm through the years.

01:07:20.778 --> 01:07:22.530
We demand retribution.

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.239
Never!

01:07:24.448 --> 01:07:27.701
But why not? There's enough
for all in this mountain.

01:07:27.909 --> 01:07:30.703
It's a matter of principle, of honour!

01:07:31.078 --> 01:07:33.330
Then tomorrow we take it!

01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:36.541
We will meet at sunrise
on the field of battle.

01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:39.210
You realize you are hopelessly outnumbered.

01:07:39.419 --> 01:07:41.087
This is ridiculous!

01:07:41.295 --> 01:07:44.548
Quiet! What does a burglar
know of these matters?

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.967
Then tomorrow it is!

01:08:04.273 --> 01:08:09.110
This is deucedly uncomfortable.
I'm certain to get a rash.

01:08:09.611 --> 01:08:13.364
That armor was forged
in the foundries of my grandfather.

01:08:13.572 --> 01:08:17.450
Wear it proudly and it will
carry you to victory!

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.027
Confusticate and bebother victory!

01:08:20.236 --> 01:08:23.947
My only hope is to be taken prisoner
as quickly as possible.

01:08:24.156 --> 01:08:26.241
Those are the words of a coward.

01:08:26.249 --> 01:08:28.917
The coward who flushed out Smaug?

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:32.587
The coward who saved you
time and time again?

01:08:32.796 --> 01:08:36.716
The coward who always went forward
while you cringed behind?

01:08:36.925 --> 01:08:39.301
You don't see us cringing now, do you?

01:08:39.801 --> 01:08:44.581
This is madness!
Fourteen against ten thousand...

01:08:44.589 --> 01:08:46.975
...and yet to march off
to certain destruction...

01:08:47.183 --> 01:08:50.728
...as merrily as if you were
on your way to another tea party.

01:08:50.937 --> 01:08:53.897
Your kind will never understand war, hobbit.

01:08:54.106 --> 01:08:56.524
This is war! War!

01:09:01.569 --> 01:09:03.781
Our lookout has spied something!

01:09:05.573 --> 01:09:08.118
O great King under the Mountain!

01:09:08.618 --> 01:09:11.953
- Balin, it's only Thorin!
- Quiet!

01:09:12.162 --> 01:09:14.622
- Yes, general?
- "General"?

01:09:14.832 --> 01:09:17.876
Another army approaches from the northeast!

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:21.671
An army of our kind. An army of dwarves!

01:09:22.129 --> 01:09:25.841
- My cousin Dain from the Iron Hills?
- None other!

01:09:26.675 --> 01:09:31.136
Ha! Now, we are not outnumbered!
Now we have an army!

01:09:31.345 --> 01:09:35.182
- A battle of three armies?
- To war!

01:09:38.685 --> 01:09:39.810
Onward!

01:09:40.103 --> 01:09:41.437
Forward!

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:43.022
To battle!

01:09:45.691 --> 01:09:47.484
- Scurvy dwarves!
- Thieving dwarves!

01:09:47.692 --> 01:09:48.526
Kill them!

01:09:48.693 --> 01:09:50.486
- Chop them!
- Take their heads!

01:09:50.862 --> 01:09:53.529
Kill the men! Kill the elves!

01:09:53.738 --> 01:09:56.199
Save the gold for ourselves!

01:09:58.701 --> 01:10:00.870
Personally, I'd rather be back in Hobbiton.

01:10:04.873 --> 01:10:08.043
- Who's that old man?
- Get out of the way!

01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:10.003
- Move, you old fool!

01:10:10.503 --> 01:10:11.712
Old fool?

01:10:12.505 --> 01:10:14.006
Gandalf!

01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:15.340
Halt!

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:19.219
I would speak with the kings!

01:10:21.095 --> 01:10:23.180
Dread has come upon you all!

01:10:23.389 --> 01:10:27.726
An army of goblins with claim to
the treasure comes from the north!

01:10:27.934 --> 01:10:29.185
Behold!

01:10:33.355 --> 01:10:35.732
They ride upon wolves!

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.279
Oh, great Elf King,
my truest friend and ally.

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:44.656
We must join our forces
against this common scourge.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:48.868
But of course, O noble
King under the Mountain.

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:51.912
Your people are like brothers onto mine.

01:10:52.079 --> 01:10:55.499
And my men and all their weapons
are as one with yours.

01:10:55.707 --> 01:10:58.501
Together we will vanquish the foul foe!

01:10:59.127 --> 01:11:00.253
Together!

01:11:00.711 --> 01:11:05.716
Thorin is correct.
I simply do not understand war.

01:11:24.606 --> 01:11:26.566
A battle of four armies.

01:11:26.775 --> 01:11:30.153
One, two, three... Yes, four!

01:11:32.613 --> 01:11:37.534
Our cause is hopeless!
The goblins are too powerful!

01:11:37.742 --> 01:11:41.245
But we'll spill much of their blood
before the day is finished.

01:11:41.454 --> 01:11:45.374
If these be our last moments, men,
let us live them with honour.

01:11:45.582 --> 01:11:50.461
Hold! All is not lost.
The goblins have many enemies.

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:53.464
There is yet still another army on the way.

01:11:54.631 --> 01:11:55.966
The eagles!

01:11:59.177 --> 01:12:01.137
Five armies now?

01:12:01.304 --> 01:12:05.891
Mr. Bilbo Baggins, enough is enough.

01:12:37.717 --> 01:12:39.510
Bombur! You're hurt!

01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:42.721
I still live. And you?

01:12:42.930 --> 01:12:46.725
A slight wound. Crack on the head.
Out for hours. What happened?

01:12:46.933 --> 01:12:49.352
We won.

01:12:55.690 --> 01:12:58.234
Bombur gone too.

01:12:58.484 --> 01:13:01.403
Of our original thirteen, how many are left?

01:13:01.612 --> 01:13:02.571
Seven.

01:13:02.863 --> 01:13:04.614
And Thorin?

01:13:05.323 --> 01:13:07.909
Soon there will be only six.

01:13:11.912 --> 01:13:13.330
I have brought him.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.707
Farewell, good thief.

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:19.210
I wish to part in friendship...

01:13:19.418 --> 01:13:21.962
...and would take back my words at the Gate.

01:13:22.171 --> 01:13:24.798
There are many words I would take back also.

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.567
And does it take this...

01:13:28.576 --> 01:13:30.636
...to make us see each other?

01:13:31.011 --> 01:13:32.805
- Thorin!
- Hush!

01:13:33.889 --> 01:13:38.684
You are no coward, my friend.
I am sorry I so named you.

01:13:38.893 --> 01:13:41.770
- This is not important...
- And I was wrong.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:45.357
You did understand war.

01:13:46.107 --> 01:13:49.068
It was I who did not.

01:13:50.361 --> 01:13:51.820
Until now.

01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:55.198
Farewell, King under the Mountain.

01:13:56.366 --> 01:13:59.035
Child of the kindly West.

01:14:00.036 --> 01:14:01.996
I have come to know...

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:06.791
...if more of us valued your ways...

01:14:07.125 --> 01:14:10.836
...food and cheer above hoarded gold...

01:14:11.712 --> 01:14:15.674
...it would be a merrier world.

01:14:16.716 --> 01:14:18.843
But sad or merry...

01:14:19.677 --> 01:14:21.971
...I must leave it now.

01:14:23.847 --> 01:14:27.642
- Farewell.
- Farewell, Thorin.

01:14:38.484 --> 01:14:42.237
You take only two tiny
bags of gold home with you?

01:14:42.946 --> 01:14:44.906
Your share was greater.

01:14:45.073 --> 01:14:49.327
It's all my pony could carry,
and it's more than I'll ever need.

01:14:49.535 --> 01:14:51.412
But you have other prizes.

01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:53.705
The ring? Oh, yes.

01:14:53.997 --> 01:14:58.626
I'll keep it as a souvenir,
in a glass box on the mantel.

01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:04.006
And so the prophecies of old
have come true.

01:15:04.214 --> 01:15:08.593
Smaug is gone and the goblins driven away.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:11.554
The dwarves and elves live in peace...

01:15:11.762 --> 01:15:16.099
...and the men thrive,
multiply and build a civilization.

01:15:16.308 --> 01:15:17.934
Prophecies, hmph!

01:15:18.142 --> 01:15:20.603
- What?
- I had a hand in all that!

01:15:20.770 --> 01:15:25.232
Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies
because you helped bring them about?

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.992
You don't really suppose, do you...

01:15:27.100 --> 01:15:31.737
...that all your adventures and
escapes were managed by mere luck...

01:15:31.946 --> 01:15:34.573
...just for your sole benefit?

01:15:35.115 --> 01:15:39.327
You're a very fine person, Mr. Baggins,
and I'm very fond of you...

01:15:39.535 --> 01:15:44.331
...but you are only quite a little
fellow in a wide world, after all.

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:46.624
Thank goodness!

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:51.212
Yes, you'll return to your home...

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.381
...place your souvenir ring
on your mantel...

01:15:54.589 --> 01:15:58.301
...publish your story, which
you believe has come to its end...

01:15:58.509 --> 01:16:01.262
What do you mean,
"believe it has come to an end"?

01:16:01.470 --> 01:16:03.889
It has, hasn't it?

01:16:04.097 --> 01:16:08.601
Oh, Bilbo Baggins, if you
really understood that ring...

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:12.896
...as someday members of
your family not yet born will...

01:16:13.105 --> 01:16:16.858
...then you'd realize that
this story has not ended...

01:16:17.066 --> 01:16:18.985
...but is only beginning.
