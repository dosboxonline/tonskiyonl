01:18.125 --> 01:20.125
Stone, how we doing?

01:20.791 --> 01:23.583
<i>Almost there.
Just pulling the encryption key.</i>

01:23.583 --> 01:26.291
Four hours in the van,
and she's eaten all the crisps.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.875
She's stuck in there with you,
so that's comfort eating.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.083
Been boring her with your cat chat again?

01:31.083 --> 01:34.958
Cat chat? Actually, Parker,
she likes my Barry the Cat stories.

01:34.958 --> 01:37.166
You like my Barry the Cat stories, right?

01:37.166 --> 01:39.958
Before you know it,
you're gonna want one of your own.

01:39.958 --> 01:42.500
Cats hate me. Sorry, Bailey.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.125
Writing a new access code.

01:45.416 --> 01:46.416
<i>Grazie.</i>

01:48.458 --> 01:49.833
I have eyes on Mulvaney.

01:49.833 --> 01:50.875
Intel was good.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.166
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

01:53.166 --> 01:57.625
<i>Europe's most wanted arms dealer
seen for the first time in three years.</i>

01:58.208 --> 02:00.625
Adding names and faces to the guest list.

02:01.500 --> 02:03.916
- How long do you need?
<i>-</i> <i>Nearly there.</i>

02:06.416 --> 02:09.041
Hang on. Something's changed.
I can't connect.

02:09.541 --> 02:11.000
The system's offline.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.166
Local access only.

02:14.083 --> 02:16.208
<i>We need a new plan to get you in.</i>

02:16.208 --> 02:17.125
What do you mean?

02:17.750 --> 02:20.500
I need direct access
to someone who's already on the network.

02:23.125 --> 02:25.041
Head of security. He's at the bar.

02:27.958 --> 02:30.500
<i>I could hack his phone,
but I'll need to be close to him.</i>

02:31.583 --> 02:33.541
- How close?
- Ten feet.

02:33.541 --> 02:37.041
<i>Stone, you're not a field agent.
Do not get out of the van.</i>

02:37.875 --> 02:38.875
She can do this.

02:40.333 --> 02:41.458
<i>It's too dangerous.</i>

02:45.375 --> 02:46.833
<i>Mulvaney's entering now.</i>

02:53.833 --> 02:57.000
Our arms dealer's on the move right now,
and I do not wanna lose him.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.416
<i>There's no other way.
We have to get Mulvaney.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Tell me what you need.

03:04.166 --> 03:07.291
When I'm within ten feet
of the head of security, call his phone.

03:07.291 --> 03:08.541
Okay, got it.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.375
Hey. Hey, Stone.

03:11.916 --> 03:12.750
You got this.

03:14.583 --> 03:15.500
Thanks, Bailey.

03:25.416 --> 03:26.916
I can't tail them any further.

03:39.083 --> 03:41.583
<i>Stone, listen to me.
Waiter to your right.</i>

03:41.583 --> 03:43.000
<i>Grab a glass of champagne.</i>

03:43.916 --> 03:45.583
- Thank you.
-  <i>Good. Now, drink it.</i>

03:46.916 --> 03:47.833
<i>Liquid courage.</i>

03:53.125 --> 03:55.125
<i>He's headed towards the blackjack table.</i>

03:56.583 --> 03:57.708
Do you know how to play?

03:58.708 --> 04:00.083
I was on the chess team.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.541
Oh my God.

04:04.791 --> 04:06.625
<i>-</i> <i>Just place a bet.</i>
- Welcome.

04:07.125 --> 04:08.541
<i>Doesn't matter if you lose.</i>

04:11.208 --> 04:13.416
Change set, seven. One hundred.

04:18.041 --> 04:20.416
- One hundred, change seven.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.958
Okay, I have access.

04:28.958 --> 04:32.583
One hundred, sir, in change.
Okay. Everybody ready?

04:32.583 --> 04:33.958
He's looking suspicious.

04:33.958 --> 04:35.291
Place your bets.

04:37.250 --> 04:38.500
He's headed towards you.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.458
Stone, walk away.

04:46.125 --> 04:47.833
- Walk away. Walk away--

04:48.333 --> 04:49.458
What are you doing?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.208
I've never played before.

04:56.916 --> 04:58.916
-  Sixteen.
- I'm sorry.

04:58.916 --> 05:00.750
You split your eights.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.583
Splitting your eights. Eighteen.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.166
Eighteen.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.416
<i>Dealer has 17.</i>

05:10.375 --> 05:11.833
- Ah, you win.
- You win it.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.500
Maybe I should quit while I'm ahead.

05:16.500 --> 05:18.125
- Thank you.

05:20.875 --> 05:22.000
<i>Nice job, Stone.</i>

05:22.000 --> 05:23.708
Not bad
for your first time out of the van.

05:23.708 --> 05:25.916
I think I just lost two years off my life.

05:26.416 --> 05:27.958
- Did it work?
<i>-</i> <i>Yeah, I'm in.</i>

05:27.958 --> 05:29.916
<i>Where the hell's Mulvaney?</i>

05:29.916 --> 05:32.500
Okay. Got him.
Through the kitchen, down the stairs.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.291
<i>Two heavies working the door.</i>

05:34.291 --> 05:35.208
On our way.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.541
Inserting you into facial recognition.

05:56.541 --> 05:57.416
Hello, beautiful.

06:00.041 --> 06:01.125
May I take this seat?

06:03.541 --> 06:05.000
Take it anywhere you like.

06:05.708 --> 06:06.916
Okay.

06:08.333 --> 06:09.166
Maybe later?

06:12.250 --> 06:13.708
Okay, you're all set.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.500
I'm almost afraid to see
what drew Mulvaney out of his hole.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.750
- Lads.
-  <i>Buona sera.</i>

06:30.375 --> 06:31.208
Okay.

06:34.416 --> 06:36.833
<i>We're now taking bets for the next game,</i>

06:36.833 --> 06:39.041
<i>which will begin in two minutes.</i>

06:39.041 --> 06:41.291
You were right
about Mulvaney's gambling habit.

06:41.916 --> 06:43.541
He never met a bet he didn't place.

06:44.125 --> 06:47.208
<i>You must predict the exact order of kills.</i>

06:47.208 --> 06:49.791
<i>Copy, Delta Kilo Six.
We have reported hostiles...</i>

06:49.791 --> 06:51.458
Those are military operations.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.375
They're wagering on body count.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.416
<i>With a bet
of four instant kills,</i>

06:58.416 --> 07:01.833
<i>this is a win for player number 46.</i>

07:02.458 --> 07:03.291
Betting on blood.

07:04.708 --> 07:05.625
<i>Yang, show me.</i>

07:08.041 --> 07:09.416
Just a bit to your right.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.208
Holy shit.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.750
That's US Navy Seals in real-time.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.291
And they've cracked
military-grade encryption.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.250
Who would have that capability?

07:20.291 --> 07:21.541
Enough tech talk.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.750
Target is Mulvaney.

07:23.958 --> 07:27.250
Okay, Dr. Yang. You have the floor.

07:27.250 --> 07:29.250
<i>Time to give Mulvaney his heart attack.</i>

07:30.166 --> 07:31.750
<i>I'll fire up the ambulance.</i>

07:51.541 --> 07:52.708
Mulvaney's exiting.

07:55.958 --> 07:57.291
You.

07:59.791 --> 08:00.875
Shit.

08:23.666 --> 08:26.041
I'll handle this guy.
You take Mulvaney.

08:29.708 --> 08:30.541
Stone.

08:30.541 --> 08:33.333
Mulvaney's on your right.
Another service corridor.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.416
Stand by to go dark.

08:42.500 --> 08:43.583
Shit.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
I've got Mulvaney.
Bailey, get us out of here. Fast.

08:55.583 --> 08:56.791
Showtime!

09:03.500 --> 09:05.125
All right. Okay. All right.

09:16.958 --> 09:18.000
<i>MI6, right?</i>

09:19.666 --> 09:21.958
You guys really need
to work on your subtlety.

09:22.583 --> 09:24.375
<i>You ruined my party.</i>

09:25.041 --> 09:27.375
<i>I should've listened
to the voices in my head.</i>

09:29.000 --> 09:31.458
"The British are coming.
The British are coming."

09:32.875 --> 09:34.458
Comms compromised.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.541
- No shit.
- Okay, okay. New plan.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.500
Exfil route Bravo. We have to go dark.

09:39.083 --> 09:40.708
Copy that. See you down there.

09:41.666 --> 09:42.500
Come on.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.958
Stone! Let's go.

09:54.583 --> 09:55.708
Hey!

09:55.708 --> 09:57.500
I'm not going anywhere.

10:07.666 --> 10:08.708
We're not done yet.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.208
More of Mulvaney's men.

10:27.375 --> 10:30.708
They're heading to the cable car station.
Parker's a sitting duck.

10:30.708 --> 10:32.333
We need to get down there now.

10:46.791 --> 10:49.708
- Stone!
- Go without me. I'll be fine.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.333
Stay put. We'll be back.

11:09.125 --> 11:12.333
Jack, this is Nine of Hearts.
Urgent forecast required.

11:13.541 --> 11:16.000
Nine, we have your position
and the full overview.

11:16.875 --> 11:18.250
Projecting forward now.

11:23.166 --> 11:25.916
The MI6 team
won't get down the mountain in time.

11:25.916 --> 11:28.791
The Heart gives
a 93 percent chance that Parker will die

11:28.791 --> 11:32.083
and Mulvaney will get away
unless the Charter intervenes.

11:34.416 --> 11:36.000
I'm gonna need a parachute.

11:37.291 --> 11:38.458
Okay.

11:38.458 --> 11:41.500
Fifty meters away,
over the handrail to your right.

11:43.208 --> 11:44.750
<i>And don't blow your cover.</i>

11:47.833 --> 11:48.666
On it.

11:55.791 --> 11:56.625
Oi!

12:07.916 --> 12:10.833
The Heart has
a chance of success at just 32 percent.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.708
Not helping, Jack.

12:17.875 --> 12:18.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.833
Um... Stone, big drop coming up.

12:21.833 --> 12:23.291
<i>Big</i> drop.

12:23.291 --> 12:25.250
- How big?
<i>-</i> <i>The mother of big.</i>

12:26.416 --> 12:27.583
<i>Really, really big.</i>

12:36.166 --> 12:37.500
And we're in the game.

12:43.791 --> 12:45.041
Look, I've got money.

12:46.458 --> 12:47.791
More than you can imagine.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.125
It wouldn't be enough.

13:00.666 --> 13:03.583
Eight minutes out.
We're not gonna make it.

13:09.625 --> 13:12.958
Stone, Mulvaney's security
are arriving at the cable car station.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.125
Take the route to your left.
You need to pick up the pace.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.875
<i>The terrain's too flat,
and you're losing altitude.</i>

13:40.875 --> 13:43.791
If you cut across to the piste,
you can pick up a snow bike.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.041
Cables! Cables! Cables! Ca--

14:23.000 --> 14:24.875
Chance of success just plummeted.

14:24.875 --> 14:26.958
Only 'cause you've got no imagination.

14:29.833 --> 14:32.791
Oh, nice. Nice.

14:46.708 --> 14:48.208
Oh, you're joking!

14:48.208 --> 14:49.208
Come on!

14:51.166 --> 14:53.041
He can hold them off without us, right?

14:54.583 --> 14:55.416
Hold on!

15:04.083 --> 15:06.333
<i>You can get ahead of
the bikes at the next corner.</i>

15:19.125 --> 15:20.750
Hey. Are you okay?

15:24.666 --> 15:25.500
We meet again.

15:27.041 --> 15:28.000
Must be destiny.

15:29.250 --> 15:30.083
Must be.

15:33.000 --> 15:33.833
Hey.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.333
Hey! Hey!

16:23.416 --> 16:25.541
Stone, watch Bailey
and Yang to your right.

16:25.541 --> 16:27.916
The Charter's worked
too hard to embed you in MI6.

16:28.416 --> 16:29.875
We cannot risk your cover.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.583
Well aware, Jack.

16:33.541 --> 16:35.000
How many in the welcome party?

16:35.708 --> 16:36.625
Six of them.

16:36.625 --> 16:40.000
Four pistols, one shotgun, and a sniper

16:40.958 --> 16:42.750
with a very impressive record.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.291
Get out of the way!

17:03.750 --> 17:06.458
<i>Get away from them.
Take the path to your right.</i>

17:31.791 --> 17:33.666
<i>The sniper has opened fire on Parker.</i>

17:43.375 --> 17:44.583
Jack, give me a line.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.416
I got the lights.

18:14.750 --> 18:15.666
<i>Behind you!</i>

18:24.375 --> 18:26.750
<i>Chance of success to 85%.</i>

18:26.750 --> 18:27.958
Only 85%?

18:28.958 --> 18:30.166
Hardly seems fair.

18:30.166 --> 18:32.750
Uh... two more on your right.

18:46.083 --> 18:46.958
Look at that.

18:47.541 --> 18:50.166
Parker and target still very much alive.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.875
Great.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.708
Now, hide the bodies
and get out before MI6 sees you.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.041
Okay.

19:12.375 --> 19:13.375
What's happening?

19:17.208 --> 19:18.208
- Yang.
- Hey.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.541
Where'd they go?

19:28.625 --> 19:29.625
Where'd who go?

19:30.416 --> 19:32.083
Mulvaney had an army of security.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.916
Got scared off by the sirens maybe?

19:34.916 --> 19:37.291
No point waiting to find out.
Let's just grab him and go.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.375
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! He's foaming.
- Shit.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.666
Bastard took cyanide.

19:51.708 --> 19:52.916
That's old school.

19:52.916 --> 19:54.041
Shit.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.666
Jesus. He's dead.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.583
Grab a leg. We have to get
back up the mountain for Stone.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.416
All right, genius. Now what?

20:11.416 --> 20:13.333

Genuine dog's breakfast.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.875
The Italians are livid,
as are Defense and Number 10.

22:00.875 --> 22:04.625
- I take full responsibility.
-  "I." That's your problem, Parker.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.583
Mulvaney's dead.

22:06.583 --> 22:09.166
Yang gave the wrong person a heart attack.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.625
And Stone, what the hell
were you thinking getting out of the van?

22:12.625 --> 22:15.500
- That was the only way she could get--
-  Put it in the report.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.666
Paperwork. Excellent.
That'll show Mulvaney's lads who's boss.

22:18.666 --> 22:19.583
Enough.

22:19.583 --> 22:22.916
Mulvaney's gone. And so is
any hope of using him as an asset.

22:23.416 --> 22:24.916
But now we have a new target.

22:25.625 --> 22:29.625
Someone broke through the highest levels
of military encryption, including our own.

22:29.625 --> 22:31.791
- Did you look into the girl?
-  The girl?

22:31.791 --> 22:34.750
Oh, yes. I'm afraid
we'll need more than that.

22:35.500 --> 22:37.875
We are trying to trace her,
but so far, we have nothing.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.041
- I'm happy to look--
-  We have people for that.

22:40.041 --> 22:41.125
Different people.

22:42.333 --> 22:45.041
You can all concentrate
on your admin. Sandra.

22:48.541 --> 22:49.708
Cheers, Sandra.

22:49.708 --> 22:51.041
Thanks, Sandra.

22:51.041 --> 22:52.125
Love you, Sandra.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.375
To Stone.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.875
- First time out of the van.
-  Hey!

22:59.875 --> 23:02.958
-  And she didn't blow the op--
-  No, we did that all on our own.

23:02.958 --> 23:06.208
Too bad. Been on a good winning streak
since Stone joined us.

23:06.208 --> 23:09.625
Thought you might be our lucky charm.
But you did win at blackjack.

23:10.416 --> 23:13.666
And I'm never gambling again
or stepping out of the van.

23:15.166 --> 23:17.000
What'd you do when I left you up there?

23:17.000 --> 23:19.416
Hid in the toilets.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.958
- What? You said to stay out of sight.
- True.

23:23.958 --> 23:25.666
All right. Leave her alone.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.541
We got more important things to discuss.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.000
Like, the girl.

23:30.875 --> 23:33.166
But let's be honest.
We already know who she works for.

23:33.166 --> 23:36.833
-  God.
- That's right. The Charter.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.708
- Strap yourselves in.

23:38.708 --> 23:42.208
Whatever. I just identified
another one of their ops.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.750
They took out a terror cell who hijacked
an oil tanker in the Panama Canal.

23:47.250 --> 23:49.416
Yeah, but who would have
that kind of power?

23:50.000 --> 23:50.833
Hm.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.166
- I'm doing it again, aren't I?
- Yeah.

23:53.166 --> 23:54.833
Okay, fine, mock me.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.000
But it's true.

23:56.000 --> 23:59.791
Ex-intelligence operatives
answering only to themselves.

23:59.791 --> 24:02.375
No national allegiances,
no political leanings.

24:02.375 --> 24:05.833
Putting out fires their governments
never allowed them to. That's...

24:06.791 --> 24:08.041
That's the Charter.

24:08.041 --> 24:10.208
The most highly trained agents

24:10.208 --> 24:13.375
working together to keep peace
in a turbulent world.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.875
No. That is a Saturday morning cartoon.

24:15.875 --> 24:18.500
Nobody knows about
the Charter because they don't exist.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.500
Pass me the vinegar.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.750
- And this girl.

24:22.750 --> 24:25.250
This girl is part of it, and you know it.

24:26.375 --> 24:28.708
Okay, don't judge me.
I'm gonna go with this for a sec.

24:29.375 --> 24:32.166
- If the Charter are such do-gooders...
- Mm.

24:32.166 --> 24:33.750
...why'd the girl interrupt our mission?

24:33.750 --> 24:34.666
Oh. Oh!

24:35.625 --> 24:37.291
That's a good question. Yep.

24:37.291 --> 24:41.791
Sorry, Bailey, there is no secret genius
organization pulling all the strings.

24:41.791 --> 24:44.583
It's just us, Sandra, and her paperwork.

24:46.041 --> 24:49.250
But it was a nice bedtime story.
Speaking of which...

24:50.125 --> 24:51.166
Already?

24:51.166 --> 24:54.583
- Jet lag.
- Um, there's a one-hour time difference.

24:55.458 --> 24:56.291
Night, guys.

24:56.291 --> 24:57.875
- Night.
- Night.

25:03.208 --> 25:04.833
Right in the eye.

25:04.833 --> 25:07.666
- I drive with that eye.
- Might make you a better driver.

25:07.666 --> 25:09.541
Can't make you worse.

25:09.541 --> 25:12.000
- Kidding. I take it back.
-  No.

26:25.500 --> 26:26.583
Sneaking up on me?

26:27.500 --> 26:29.416
A field agent
should be ready for anything.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.875
You were saying?
I never should have told you I swim.

26:35.375 --> 26:36.583
A weak moment.

26:37.416 --> 26:38.250
I liked it.

26:39.791 --> 26:41.791
So... the girl.

26:42.625 --> 26:43.583
What news?

26:44.291 --> 26:46.958
No news. We were told not to look.

26:47.541 --> 26:48.708
You're a terrible liar.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.958
Look, if we leave it
to the pen-pushers at MI6,

26:51.958 --> 26:54.291
she'll hack the entire world
before we even get a name.

26:54.875 --> 26:56.958
I should've gone beyond the mission
and brought her in.

26:57.458 --> 26:59.583
Well, your hands were pretty full
at the time.

27:00.083 --> 27:02.083
And besides, it wasn't our objective.

27:03.125 --> 27:05.625
Why don't you try and live a little?
Could be fun.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.041
What happened to
"Don't get out of the van, Rachel"?

27:09.041 --> 27:09.958
Ah.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.958
- This is different.
- Hm.

27:13.041 --> 27:15.708
So, rules are rules
unless they apply to you.

27:15.708 --> 27:18.458
Why do I feel like you know me better
than I know you?

27:18.958 --> 27:21.500
Maybe I should listen to one of these
dreary podcasts of yours.

27:21.500 --> 27:24.375
<i>- ♪ Don't stop thinking about tomorrow</i>... <i>♪
-</i> Ah.

27:24.375 --> 27:25.666
Bailey got to you, huh?

27:26.166 --> 27:28.666
Mock our music,
and I won't tell you my theory.

27:28.666 --> 27:29.875
My lips are sealed.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.666
She's new to the scene. Has to be.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.333
Otherwise, we would have heard about her.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.375
To get a guest list like that--

27:44.375 --> 27:47.083
She's working with someone else.
A veteran. But who?

27:47.916 --> 27:49.791
We'll make a list. I'll bring snacks.

27:51.625 --> 27:55.250
I, uh, I'm sorry.
I already have... a brunch date.

27:57.083 --> 27:58.083
Can I come?

28:00.416 --> 28:01.375
Bye, Parker.

28:25.541 --> 28:27.166
Ivo? It's been a while.

28:27.875 --> 28:30.125
Nine of Hearts, it's good to see you.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.000
- How's it going?
- It's been busy. This way.

28:34.041 --> 28:37.625
The Charter has been dealing with
three actionable threats this morning.

28:37.625 --> 28:40.083
Potential sarin gas attack in Paris.

28:40.083 --> 28:44.625
The Heart predicted the time and location
of the attack with 87% certainty.

28:44.625 --> 28:46.541
Eight of Hearts is on site now.

28:47.041 --> 28:50.000
Six is defusing
a potential international incident

28:50.000 --> 28:51.458
in the South China Sea.

28:52.250 --> 28:56.708
And Diamonds team's handling hackers
targeting the North American power grid.

28:58.208 --> 29:01.125
That, um... That's the peacock.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.708
- Hi.
- Came with the house.

29:04.208 --> 29:06.041
-  Hey, Jack.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.333
Enjoying your new office?

29:07.333 --> 29:09.666
We can't all be
gallivanting around the Alps.

29:10.166 --> 29:13.166
How's King of Hearts? Is she angry?

29:13.166 --> 29:14.375
Have you seen her yet?

29:14.375 --> 29:18.000
Well, let's see. You lost control
of the situation, target is dead,

29:18.000 --> 29:19.625
then you had to kill six men.

29:19.625 --> 29:20.916
What a glorious outcome.

29:21.416 --> 29:24.125
- Victoria Crosses all around.
-  Morning, Nomad.

29:24.125 --> 29:27.333
Good to see you too.
Love what you've done with the place.

29:28.833 --> 29:30.541
Is she developing a sense of humor?

29:31.208 --> 29:33.208
- Did you find the girl?
- Of course.

29:34.958 --> 29:35.875
Keya Dhawan.

29:36.791 --> 29:39.791
She is from Pune in the west of India.

29:40.416 --> 29:41.500
Orphaned at eight.

29:42.625 --> 29:44.166
How'd she learn to program?

29:44.166 --> 29:45.916
Ever heard of Niam Kharche?

29:45.916 --> 29:48.458
Billionaire investor, pharmaceuticals.

29:48.458 --> 29:49.958
Had business in Pune.

29:49.958 --> 29:53.041
Ran IT workshops for kids
in underprivileged communities.

29:54.833 --> 29:57.291
He spotted her
in one of these programs.

29:57.291 --> 30:01.041
Yeah. He saw she was a prodigy,
took her under his wing, trained her up,

30:01.541 --> 30:03.541
and then they had a falling out.

30:03.541 --> 30:04.458
Why?

30:04.958 --> 30:06.708
The Heart's better at whats than whys.

30:06.708 --> 30:09.666
And the what is,
she split from Kharche and disappeared.

30:12.791 --> 30:13.875
She's 22 now.

30:14.416 --> 30:16.166
Not much older than when we met.

30:16.166 --> 30:19.041
Yes, but she fell in with
a bunch of criminal lowlifes.

30:19.041 --> 30:20.958
Some people get all the luck.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.791
We think that Keya
set up the casino of blood.

30:26.291 --> 30:29.625
She knew about Mulvaney's
gambling habit and used it to lure him in.

30:29.625 --> 30:30.541
Why?

30:31.833 --> 30:36.000
Mulvaney had become
obsessed with a new weapon, a myth.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.583
A quantum computer sophisticated enough
to hack into anything, anywhere.

30:41.708 --> 30:42.541
The Heart.

30:44.958 --> 30:46.125
So, where is she now?

30:54.791 --> 30:57.000
The Heart predicts with 96% certainty

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
that Keya is heading to Lisbon
for the opening of Club Moritz.

31:00.500 --> 31:03.000
So, we will leak her location to MI6.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.583
Then we should have your operation
back up and running within 24 hours.

31:07.083 --> 31:08.333
It doesn't feel right.

31:10.041 --> 31:13.083
Keya chose to hack into
our comms feed on the mountain.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.625
She revealed herself to me,
looked me straight in the eye.

31:15.625 --> 31:18.291
I'm not sure
if we should ignore the Heart,

31:18.291 --> 31:21.041
the closest mankind
has to perfect intelligence,

31:21.041 --> 31:22.875
because of eye contact in a bar.

31:22.875 --> 31:24.625
This might be why you're single, Jack.

31:25.541 --> 31:26.958
Just follow the numbers.

31:27.833 --> 31:29.208
Your mission is Lisbon.

31:29.833 --> 31:31.208
And if she's not there?

31:31.208 --> 31:32.208
Eat tapas.

31:33.250 --> 31:34.750
Just not with your MI6 team.

31:37.958 --> 31:39.833
So, you're spying on <i>me</i> now.

31:41.625 --> 31:43.166
I'm tracking my asset.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.250
You know what you signed up for.

31:48.833 --> 31:50.750
No relationships. No friends.

31:50.750 --> 31:52.916
No poolside tête-à-tête.

31:54.541 --> 31:57.000
What we do is too important.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.625
When governments fail,
the only thing left is the Charter.

32:01.125 --> 32:03.500
I'm undercover. This is just part of it.

32:04.833 --> 32:06.958
- Everything's under control.
- Good.

32:08.333 --> 32:09.333
Keep it that way.

32:10.125 --> 32:11.833
Your target is Dhawan.

32:31.416 --> 32:33.625
Come on, Keya. Take the bait.

33:00.833 --> 33:01.666
Smile.

33:49.541 --> 33:50.458
Hey, Bailey.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.666
<i>Hey.
We got a lead on hacker girl.</i>

33:52.666 --> 33:53.875
<i>We're going to Lisbon.</i>

33:54.708 --> 33:56.250
Better call the cat sitter.

33:56.750 --> 33:58.666
Oh no, no. Barry's all right. He's--

33:59.291 --> 34:01.291
I told him, no parties.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.625
<i>Okay. Sweet dreams.</i>

34:05.833 --> 34:06.958
<i>Wheels up at eight.</i>

34:07.708 --> 34:08.541
Got it.

34:10.041 --> 34:11.416
- Night, Bailey.
<i>- Night.</i>

34:19.125 --> 34:20.958
<i>What about this?</i>

34:20.958 --> 34:24.125
<i>Ah Jesus. Just when we thought
it couldn't get worse.</i>

34:25.250 --> 34:28.166
-  <i>Are you singing?
-</i> <i>I'm clearing my throat.</i>

34:28.166 --> 34:29.208
Tune.

34:29.208 --> 34:30.916
-  <i>Look at that.</i>
-  <i>No.</i>

34:30.916 --> 34:32.125
<i>Voice of an angel.</i>

34:35.541 --> 34:39.083
<i>♪ You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say ♪</i>

34:40.333 --> 34:41.916
<i>♪ I'll speak a little louder ♪</i>

34:41.916 --> 34:43.250
<i>♪ I'll even shout ♪</i>

34:44.250 --> 34:47.583
<i>♪ You know that I'm proud

Bailey, you should meet my gran.
She has the same taste in music,

35:11.208 --> 35:12.666
and you have the same hair.

35:15.208 --> 35:17.000
It's my van, my tunes.

35:17.000 --> 35:18.541
Yeah, that's what she says.

35:24.250 --> 35:26.500
-  Oh, sorry.
-  Whoa.

35:26.500 --> 35:29.125
Little harder next time.
I didn't quite crack a tooth.

35:31.791 --> 35:32.958
You okay back there?

35:34.208 --> 35:35.750
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just, uh...

35:36.250 --> 35:37.625
-  Carsick.
- Mm.

35:40.791 --> 35:42.333
Come on, swap seats with me.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.041
- What? No, no, no. It's fine.
- Come on. No, it's fine. Move.

35:47.958 --> 35:49.291
- Okay.

35:53.625 --> 35:54.958
-  Jesus!
-  Seatbelt.

35:54.958 --> 35:55.916
Bailey!

35:55.916 --> 35:58.000

35:58.000 --> 35:59.291
Sorry.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.750
-  Okay?
- Yeah.

36:21.083 --> 36:22.666
How long till the club opens?

36:22.666 --> 36:24.625
We head out in a couple of hours.

36:34.666 --> 36:35.500
Hey, Stone.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.500
Sent you something. Check it out.

36:42.833 --> 36:45.083
- What is this?
- It's for my niece's birthday.

36:46.208 --> 36:49.083
What do you think? Female perspective?

36:49.083 --> 36:51.250
It's very pink.

37:13.041 --> 37:15.291
Parker, this music is ancient.

37:15.291 --> 37:18.416
- What are you, a hundred years old?
- It's called culture.

37:20.208 --> 37:23.125
Yeah. Sorry, Parker, I'm with Yang. Yang!

37:27.583 --> 37:28.416
Yes!

37:29.875 --> 37:31.625
- Woo!
- Oh, okay.

37:32.291 --> 37:33.541
Now we're talking.

37:36.250 --> 37:37.541
Woo!

37:37.541 --> 37:39.833
Oh, come on, Bailey. You know you want to.

Yes, I do.

38:19.500 --> 38:20.708
Woo!

38:21.291 --> 38:23.083
- She's smiling.
-  Oh yeah!

38:36.333 --> 38:38.375
<i>Six hostiles entering the building...</i>

38:38.875 --> 38:39.875
Nine, I have you.

38:40.875 --> 38:43.666
Six hostiles moving up the stairs.
More outside.

38:43.666 --> 38:46.291
They'll breach the doorway in four...

38:47.416 --> 38:48.416
<i>three...</i>

38:49.583 --> 38:50.416
<i>two...</i>

38:51.500 --> 38:52.333
<i>one.</i>

39:05.750 --> 39:06.708
Parker.

39:34.833 --> 39:35.875
We're gonna get you out.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.583
Stone, go now!

39:50.666 --> 39:52.250
Nine, the window.

39:53.250 --> 39:54.250
<i>Get out. Now.</i>

40:00.541 --> 40:01.583
<i>Stone, you will die.</i>

40:11.916 --> 40:13.291
Jack, I need your help.

40:14.125 --> 40:16.500
Plotting exit routes... now.

40:16.500 --> 40:18.708
Come on. Parker, come on. Come on!

40:35.166 --> 40:36.375
I'm going back in.

40:36.375 --> 40:37.916
What? No.

40:37.916 --> 40:39.583
<i>Saving them is not your mission.</i>

40:39.583 --> 40:41.333
<i>- Get out of there.</i>
- Jack, please.

40:41.333 --> 40:43.916
No. At best, you break cover.
Most likely, you die.

40:49.708 --> 40:50.625
Stone?

40:52.083 --> 40:52.916
Stone?

40:53.500 --> 40:54.333
Stone!

42:20.791 --> 42:22.125
- Holy shit.
- Come on.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.375
Time to go.

42:24.958 --> 42:26.500
There'll be more. Come on.

42:41.208 --> 42:43.208
Van's a no-go. Go, go.

43:05.125 --> 43:06.458
Does that thing ever work?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.833
Yeah, yeah. It works.

43:07.833 --> 43:09.125
Just not on every car.

43:11.791 --> 43:13.208
There. Move!

43:31.541 --> 43:33.041
Stone. Now would be good.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.083
Move over. I've got this.

43:46.666 --> 43:49.333
- Away from the guns, Stone. Away!
- Just a second.

43:57.666 --> 43:58.708
Down! Down! Down!

44:22.833 --> 44:24.250
Go! Go, go, go, go!

44:30.916 --> 44:32.875
Okay, Stone. Time to start talking.

44:32.875 --> 44:36.750
You hack, you fight, and you drive.
Parker, are you getting this?

44:39.708 --> 44:42.875
- Three vehicles. Lots of guns.
- Yeah, I can tell by the bullets.

44:51.083 --> 44:53.333
- Stone!
- Sort of in the middle of something.

44:59.333 --> 45:00.166
Whoa!

45:01.708 --> 45:03.166
Brakes, brakes, brakes!

45:04.500 --> 45:05.708
Whoa!

45:06.916 --> 45:08.541
Oh, okay. Okay, you got it.

45:17.833 --> 45:18.833
Yang.

45:19.958 --> 45:21.791
- Got it.
- On your three o'clock.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.666
In three, two, one.

45:45.541 --> 45:46.375
Clip's out.

46:06.041 --> 46:09.208
- Are you trying to kill us?
- Pretty much the opposite, actually.

46:17.083 --> 46:19.833
Okay. This might be kind of intense.

46:36.208 --> 46:37.166
Oh, this isn't good.

47:06.125 --> 47:08.041
- Stone, they're still coming.
- I know.

47:11.333 --> 47:12.541
Hold on.

47:47.625 --> 47:51.500
Well, I can't speak for the others,
but I... I think you're ready for the field.

48:03.333 --> 48:05.583
We need to get off the road
and lose this van.

48:32.041 --> 48:32.875
Rachel.

48:33.666 --> 48:34.500
Rachel.

48:37.000 --> 48:37.833
Stone.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.166
Who the hell are you?

48:48.750 --> 48:49.625
It's complicated.

48:49.625 --> 48:51.750
- From where I'm sitting,

48:51.750 --> 48:54.458
a baby agent from IT
just took out an entire kill team.

48:55.041 --> 48:58.041
- Bailey, what's taking you so long?
- Shit.

48:58.625 --> 49:01.208
The Charter?
You're the... you're the bloody Charter?

49:01.875 --> 49:04.416
What, are you trying to
bring in Dhawan yourself?

49:04.916 --> 49:06.541
Are you working with her?

49:09.625 --> 49:10.458
Answer him.

49:11.833 --> 49:12.791
You owe us that.

49:15.000 --> 49:16.166
We're after her too.

49:16.666 --> 49:17.958
Oh my God.

49:20.000 --> 49:21.041
The Charter's real.

49:22.208 --> 49:23.375
And you're one of them.

49:23.875 --> 49:25.875
I wish I could've told you more.

49:26.750 --> 49:28.333
But we all want the same thing.

49:29.291 --> 49:30.125
No, we don't.

49:36.125 --> 49:38.208
You're not the only one with a secret.

49:43.708 --> 49:45.541
Did they mean something to you?

49:47.083 --> 49:50.041
Oh, come on, Rachel.
You're only playing a part, right?

49:52.166 --> 49:53.458
Who are you, Parker?

49:54.833 --> 49:56.000
Why don't you ask the Heart?

49:59.833 --> 50:02.541
If you wanted me dead,
you would have shot me first.

50:03.333 --> 50:05.541
Still a few things I need to know.

50:06.041 --> 50:08.416
About you, the Charter.

50:09.333 --> 50:10.666
But perhaps most of all,

50:11.708 --> 50:13.375
I was looking forward to a fight.

50:24.250 --> 50:25.500
- Talk.

50:31.333 --> 50:34.375
Keya and I learned
that the Charter infiltrated MI6.

50:35.875 --> 50:37.333
I had to flush out who.

50:37.958 --> 50:39.875
At first, I thought it was Yang,

50:40.666 --> 50:42.458
but I was so pleased it was you.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.000
Keya's working for you?

50:48.416 --> 50:49.916
Your hand's shaking.

50:51.875 --> 50:53.166
You barely nicked me.

50:53.750 --> 50:54.875
That was the point.

50:55.666 --> 50:56.500
Poison-tipped.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.125
A little basic, I know,
but it hits the spot.

51:02.208 --> 51:04.541
Looks like the paralysis is kicking in.

51:05.666 --> 51:08.375
I spent six years
looking for you people, Stone.

51:09.166 --> 51:11.291
Then fate brings you straight to me.

51:12.166 --> 51:13.500
You're a very good agent.

51:14.541 --> 51:18.541
But you were so busy letting a machine
think for you that you missed me.

51:20.208 --> 51:21.041
Right here,

51:21.916 --> 51:23.250
in front of your face...

51:25.500 --> 51:26.416
the whole time.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.500
And Mulvaney?

51:32.375 --> 51:33.208
Oh...

51:34.041 --> 51:35.708
Well, he was tech-averse like me.

51:36.625 --> 51:38.041
Kept everything up here.

51:39.125 --> 51:43.125
So, Keya and I set up
our casino of blood to lure him in.

51:44.791 --> 51:47.166
We needed to have a little chat
about the Heart.

51:47.166 --> 51:48.666
All right. Okay, okay, okay.

51:50.791 --> 51:51.875
Talk.

51:51.875 --> 51:52.791
Yeah, I--

51:54.250 --> 51:57.333
<i>The Heart is
what gives the Charter its power.</i>

51:57.833 --> 52:01.041
<i>It's the most formidable weapon
you never knew existed.</i>

52:01.541 --> 52:03.583
<i>It can hack into anything, anywhere.</i>

52:04.541 --> 52:09.166
<i>Cell phones, power grids, the banks,
governments, military, health records.</i>

52:10.291 --> 52:11.458
<i>Your secrets.</i>

52:12.291 --> 52:14.791
<i>It knows you
better than you know yourself.</i>

52:15.416 --> 52:16.458
<i>It's determinism.</i>

52:17.750 --> 52:21.416
<i>With access to trillions of data points
at once, its modeling is so accurate</i>

52:21.416 --> 52:22.958
<i>it can predict the future.</i>

52:24.708 --> 52:26.875
<i>The Heart is knowledge and power.</i>

52:28.041 --> 52:31.125
<i>It can crash a market
or drop a plane out of the sky.</i>

52:31.875 --> 52:35.833
<i>Who needs to steal a nuclear bomb
when you can control them all?</i>

52:37.333 --> 52:38.583
<i>If you own the Heart...</i>

52:40.458 --> 52:41.541
<i>you own the world.</i>

52:48.458 --> 52:49.291
Where is it?

52:51.333 --> 52:53.541
Where... is it?

52:55.916 --> 52:58.000
Only a Charter member could tell you.

52:59.958 --> 53:02.166
The poison's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

53:03.625 --> 53:04.875
Cold War paralytic.

53:06.208 --> 53:08.208
My chemist does all the classics.

53:09.125 --> 53:10.333
Like cyanide.

53:21.916 --> 53:23.166
Oh, relax, Rachel.

53:24.500 --> 53:28.750
Killing you is not part of the plan.
We need you to deliver a package first.

53:32.375 --> 53:35.166
- I've loved working with you, Rachel.

53:36.166 --> 53:37.000
Hand on heart.

54:31.666 --> 54:32.500
Stone?

54:35.083 --> 54:35.916
Stone?

54:36.416 --> 54:38.333
She's awake. She's awake.

54:41.541 --> 54:44.083
Hold her here. Hold her down.

54:46.041 --> 54:46.958
Oh shit.

54:49.916 --> 54:52.333
- Take this. Help me. Help me here.

54:53.250 --> 54:54.291
Keep her steady.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.625
Cholinest-- Cholines--

54:57.625 --> 54:59.791
Wait. Get me atropine. Five mils.

54:59.791 --> 55:01.416
It's cholinesterase.

55:01.416 --> 55:02.666
Jack. Jack.

55:02.666 --> 55:04.833
-  We've been breached.
- How?

55:05.500 --> 55:08.625
It's... There's a Trojan
in our system delivered wirelessly.

55:08.625 --> 55:10.500
Chewing through security
like it isn't there.

55:10.500 --> 55:11.583
Restrict all access.

55:11.583 --> 55:14.708
Nomad, I've tried. No-go.
They're trying to access the Heart.

55:14.708 --> 55:17.041
From where? We're walled off.

55:20.208 --> 55:22.500
It's a weak wireless signal.
It's coming from...

55:24.500 --> 55:25.666
inside the building.

55:27.166 --> 55:28.041
Stone.

55:28.041 --> 55:30.083
Quickly.
We need to monitor her airway.

55:31.000 --> 55:32.875
-  Go ahead.
-  Hold her.

55:33.458 --> 55:34.500
Press down.

55:35.875 --> 55:36.791
That didn't do it.

55:47.500 --> 55:49.791
- Stone.

55:49.791 --> 55:52.041
What's happened?
I need to know what's happened.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.583
How long were we compromised?

55:56.083 --> 55:58.875
Three minutes and 45 seconds.
Running a system check now.

55:58.875 --> 56:01.333
We need to know what they accessed.
Is the Locker safe?

56:01.333 --> 56:02.625
Boom.

56:02.625 --> 56:04.291
The Locker is still flying high

56:04.291 --> 56:06.791
with the Heart safe inside,
85,000 feet up.

56:07.750 --> 56:09.708
No one's getting up there
without a space shuttle.

56:09.708 --> 56:12.333
It's passing over the Atlantic,
towards West Africa.

56:12.333 --> 56:14.791
And the other suits,
can they still access the Heart?

56:14.791 --> 56:17.750
- Looks like it-- Jesus.
- What?

56:17.750 --> 56:20.500
There've been
100,000 attempts to access files.

56:20.500 --> 56:23.916
Clubs team are analyzing the data,
but looks like our security held.

56:23.916 --> 56:25.791
We need to shut it all down now.

56:26.625 --> 56:29.958
- Shut what down? The Heart?
- Until we know what they've done.

56:30.458 --> 56:32.541
We have no idea what they're capable of.

56:32.541 --> 56:35.166
Don't need to shut it down
to find out what they've done.

56:35.166 --> 56:37.916
- We'd be harming ourselves.
- We don't know. She's not stupid.

56:37.916 --> 56:40.583
- And neither are we.
- Sure about that? Because right now--

56:40.583 --> 56:42.375
Rachel. Rachel. He's right.

56:42.375 --> 56:43.333
We'll sort it.

56:44.083 --> 56:44.916
"We"?

56:45.833 --> 56:47.916
A word in private. Now.

56:57.750 --> 57:01.000
I told you. I knew Keya
was playing us, playing the Heart.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.208
No, you didn't. No, you didn't
You had a feeling.

57:03.208 --> 57:06.208
Nothing... nothing concrete,
nothing actionable.

57:06.208 --> 57:09.250
A mood, a notion, a hunch, a bollocks.
We don't trade in those.

57:09.250 --> 57:10.666
I knew she wouldn't be there.

57:10.666 --> 57:13.083
You ignored the Heart,
and you went back in.

57:13.083 --> 57:15.041
- To save my team.
- They weren't your team.

57:15.041 --> 57:17.458
They died anyway.
You going back made sure of that.

57:20.541 --> 57:21.750
You blew your cover.

57:22.916 --> 57:25.625
If you'd left when we told you to,
Parker would've followed you,

57:25.625 --> 57:28.083
we'd have caught him,
and Yang and Bailey might be alive.

57:31.208 --> 57:34.333
- I should've just listened to the Heart?
- Yes.

57:41.333 --> 57:43.666
The Charter exists for one reason.

57:44.875 --> 57:48.166
To maximize lives saved.
That's the only moral metric there is.

57:48.166 --> 57:52.000
And it's a calculation.
A pure and objective calculation.

57:52.000 --> 57:53.666
Made for us by a machine.

57:53.666 --> 57:55.833
Have you forgotten how radical that is?

57:57.791 --> 58:01.416
It doesn't mean
that what we do is easy or feels nice.

58:01.416 --> 58:04.500
You'll have the voices of those people
in your head for the rest of your life.

58:04.500 --> 58:08.250
And you will never
not feel responsible for them ever.

58:09.625 --> 58:11.875
But the end justifies the means.

58:15.041 --> 58:18.416
I spent every day with Parker
for a year and didn't see it coming.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.000
No.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.125
Neither did the Heart.

58:27.166 --> 58:28.500
So, what do we do now?

58:28.500 --> 58:30.416
I'm...

58:33.666 --> 58:36.500
Gonna make some tough choices,
and this is the first one.

58:37.000 --> 58:38.875
I'm standing you down, Rachel.

58:39.666 --> 58:41.250
Go home. Get some rest.

58:41.250 --> 58:43.583
Keep your head down.
Don't do anything stupid.

58:45.541 --> 58:46.625
You can't do this.

58:46.625 --> 58:47.833
You're compromised.

58:48.916 --> 58:50.583
Parker knows you. Dhawan knows you.

58:50.583 --> 58:54.458
And the other Kings, quite rightly...
don't know if you can be trusted.

58:55.083 --> 58:55.916
And you?

58:58.416 --> 59:02.083
I want to protect what we've spent
20 years trying to build.

59:04.875 --> 59:05.916
So, I'm just out.

59:08.166 --> 59:09.583
It's about the greater good.

59:11.208 --> 59:12.333
It's nothing personal.

59:12.833 --> 59:13.666
No.

59:15.083 --> 59:16.583
I'm starting to see that.

59:46.791 --> 59:47.708
Hello?

59:48.208 --> 59:50.208
- Stone? Wrong number. Wait.
- It's for me.

59:51.750 --> 59:52.750
That's my phone. I--

59:53.250 --> 59:56.958
<i>So, why is a Charter agent
riding around all alone</i>,

59:56.958 --> 59:58.833
<i>just hours after being poisoned?</i>

59:58.833 --> 01:00:02.375
Doesn't feel like they're taking care of
their most valuable player.

01:00:02.375 --> 01:00:03.458
What do you want?

01:00:04.041 --> 01:00:05.375
<i>Don't be a sore loser.</i>

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:09.041
<i>I bet you used to think we were so alike.
Now you know I'm better.</i>

01:00:09.041 --> 01:00:11.833
Better? You killed my friends.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:13.875
What?

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:15.958
<i>You didn't know, huh?</i>

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.666
Well, I told you this wasn't a game, Keya.

01:00:19.458 --> 01:00:20.666
Heart or no Heart,

01:00:21.875 --> 01:00:23.041
I'm coming for you.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:32.958
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:39.375
Nomad. Great spot.

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:49.833
All four kings in the same room.
How long has it been, three years?

01:00:50.416 --> 01:00:51.750
Not long enough.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:57.291
So, who is this Parker,
and how did we miss him?

01:00:58.208 --> 01:01:01.791
Career intelligence agent.
Born in Belfast, lives alone.

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:05.416
He has no one he cares for.
There's nothing much to live for.

01:01:05.416 --> 01:01:10.458
He has devoted his life
to a country that sees him as expendable.

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:13.541
Okay. We get it.
All that is fuel for the fire.

01:01:13.541 --> 01:01:17.333
- But it won't burn without a spark.
-  I was getting to that.

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:22.583
I had to lean extremely hard on
some very old friends for this.

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:26.458
Chechnya, December 2015.

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.583
What's this?

01:01:29.166 --> 01:01:32.791
It was before your time.
Before the Heart, for that matter.

01:01:32.791 --> 01:01:38.000
A Chechen warlord was given free rein
by the Chechen and Russian governments.

01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:41.708
The West, as always, were
looking the other way.

01:01:41.708 --> 01:01:45.750
He was wiping out whole villages,
trying to stamp out dissent.

01:01:46.541 --> 01:01:49.041
But... what's this got to do with Parker?

01:01:49.875 --> 01:01:51.000
He was there.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:01:57.833
Different identity. No electronic records.

01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.708
But he was there, with MI6,

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:03.708
delivering weapons
to take the warlord out.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:07.958
Any sign of them?

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:11.125
You got an ETA yet?

01:02:11.125 --> 01:02:12.166
They'll be here.

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:21.625
We intercepted a communication.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:23.666
It was a trap.

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:35.625
Intelligence came through from MI6
that their entire team had been executed.

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:37.500
We thought there was no one left to save.

01:02:38.416 --> 01:02:42.041
The region was a tinderbox
on the verge of full civil war.

01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:45.208
We couldn't let those weapons
fall into the warlord's hands.

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:47.541
It would have cost thousands of lives.

01:02:49.708 --> 01:02:54.125
We had a drone that was stationed
overhead armed with missiles.

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.041
I gave the order myself.

01:03:09.458 --> 01:03:13.166
We made it look like a rebel force
had ordered the drone strike.

01:03:13.166 --> 01:03:15.583
MI6 buried their mistake.

01:03:16.166 --> 01:03:18.500
No report, no investigation.

01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:22.625
No record of the personnel
who had been involved.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.125
We thought everyone had died.

01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:28.750
Until a few hours ago.

01:03:30.750 --> 01:03:31.708
What a mess.

01:03:32.916 --> 01:03:37.666
So, you think... he knows it was us?

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:40.416
I think that's a safe assumption.

01:03:42.833 --> 01:03:45.750
And now he wants to destroy the Charter.

01:03:52.833 --> 01:03:54.250
You killed Bailey and Yang?

01:03:55.083 --> 01:03:56.333
That wasn't the plan.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:59.583
You stick to the tech
and leave strategy to me, okay?

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:03.833
Let me remind you, we're partners. Okay?
So if you want me to do my job,

01:04:03.833 --> 01:04:06.625
you have to tell me
what you're doing before you do it.

01:04:07.125 --> 01:04:09.166
Let me remind you,
the Charter don't give two shits

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:10.958
about people like Bailey and Yang.

01:04:11.583 --> 01:04:14.583
So, if you want us to succeed,
you shouldn't either.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:10.541
Hey, Barry.

01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:13.083
I'm a friend of your dad's.

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:17.583
It's okay.

01:05:28.250 --> 01:05:29.458
I've got you.

01:06:00.916 --> 01:06:01.750
The camera.

01:06:07.833 --> 01:06:09.750
She hacked into the camera feed.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.916
Let's see how well she covered her tracks.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:32.833
There she is.

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:35.500
What's in the desert, Keya?

01:06:36.416 --> 01:06:38.541
I'm guessing it's not the nightlife.

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:42.458
Are you shitting me?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.916
West Africa. The Locker.

01:06:47.916 --> 01:06:51.291
 You ever done this before?
Choppered in at over 40,000 feet?

01:06:51.291 --> 01:06:53.750
Trick question. No one has.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:57.416
But my mama always said
I could do anything.

01:06:57.416 --> 01:06:59.666
How long do we have
before the Locker descends?

01:06:59.666 --> 01:07:01.458
Eleven hours and seven minutes.

01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:05.000
At which point,
the Charter will realize what's going on.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.291
It'll take nine minutes and 26 seconds
for the Locker to drop to 40,000 feet.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:11.958
We'll have about eight minutes
to get in, take the Heart,

01:07:11.958 --> 01:07:13.833
and get out again
before they regain control.

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:14.958
Very precise.

01:07:16.083 --> 01:07:16.916
You're sure?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.500
No. I'll be sure when it descends.

01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:23.791
If they found my code, it won't descend,
they'll be waiting for us, and we all die.

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:32.875
- Hey.
- Good morning.

01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:33.875
What time is it?

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:35.958
Uh, it's nearly seven.

01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:37.083
What? Oh shit.

01:07:37.583 --> 01:07:38.416
Any luck?

01:07:38.416 --> 01:07:41.791
Uh... nothing. But they need to
pop their heads up at some point.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.708
- I'll see if they--

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:51.000
Oh no, no, no, no, no.

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.916
Get Nomad now! Get Nomad now!

01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:02.250
Just get me up there. I'll do the rest.

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.375
Nomad will string me up for this.

01:08:04.375 --> 01:08:05.791
Tell her I stole your keys.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:10.291
You'll just have to trust me.

01:08:15.541 --> 01:08:17.625
Okay. Moment of truth.

01:08:18.208 --> 01:08:19.833
How will we know if it's worked?

01:08:23.125 --> 01:08:24.583
Would you look at that?

01:08:32.083 --> 01:08:35.291
The Locker has been dropped
15,000 feet in the last two minutes.

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.375
Still descending.

01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:39.416
Security systems are all down.
I'm locked out.

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:43.500
- How is that even possible? Another hack?
- No. No.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:45.791
This is why they did it the first time.

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:48.125
It's been lying dormant
in our system until now.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:49.666
- Can you override it?
- I'm trying.

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:21.250
The air lock's been breached.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.458
Contact every Charter agent in the region.

01:09:24.333 --> 01:09:26.250
There's no one within 500 miles.

01:09:29.708 --> 01:09:33.791
<i>Approaching coordinates
in five, four, three--</i>

01:09:34.416 --> 01:09:37.083
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.</i>
-  Tell me about it.

01:09:53.125 --> 01:09:56.208
- We have a something approaching fast.
-  A something?

01:09:56.208 --> 01:09:58.041
-  Thirty seconds out.
- What is it?

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.958
I think-- I think it's a someone.

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:06.708
Who is it?

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:09.125
Go in closer.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.041
Is that--?

01:10:16.125 --> 01:10:17.000
It's Stone.

01:10:28.458 --> 01:10:30.916
I have to descend. Lower the rotor speed.

01:10:31.416 --> 01:10:33.625
<i>Copy that.
See you in seven minutes.</i>

01:10:44.291 --> 01:10:45.916
She's not gonna make it.

01:10:57.416 --> 01:10:58.583
- Woo!

01:11:04.791 --> 01:11:05.791
Look who it is.

01:11:06.666 --> 01:11:08.291
- I'm gonna need a minute.
- No!

01:11:08.291 --> 01:11:11.458
The ship's lining is filled with hydrogen.
One spark, and we're all dead.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.708
No way to get hold of her.

01:11:37.708 --> 01:11:38.750
Come on, Rachel.

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:40.333
Come on.

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.750
It's over, Keya.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:09.791
For who?

01:12:16.125 --> 01:12:18.000
I told you not to get out of the van.

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:20.250
You also told me to have some fun.

01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:00.250
It's gone.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.416
And now you answer to me.

01:13:09.416 --> 01:13:10.666
We've lost the Heart.

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:16.125
Not yet.

01:13:32.250 --> 01:13:34.750
Parker. Ninety seconds. Let's go.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.875
Shame about your parachute.
You'll be needing that.

01:15:01.083 --> 01:15:03.000
-  Get off me!

01:15:06.416 --> 01:15:08.583
No, no, no, no, no!

01:15:13.166 --> 01:15:14.333
- Get after them.
- Impossible.

01:15:14.333 --> 01:15:17.125
- We'll be lucky to get to base as it is.

01:15:31.916 --> 01:15:33.583
Get away!

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.833
Leave me alone!

01:17:02.291 --> 01:17:03.708
Morning, sunshine.

01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:08.916
Give me that thing before somebody gets--

01:17:12.916 --> 01:17:13.916
I don't think so.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:18.333
So, here's what's gonna happen.

01:17:18.333 --> 01:17:21.416
You're gonna secret-agent
our way back to civilization,

01:17:21.416 --> 01:17:24.458
and I'm gonna follow
three steps behind you with this gun.

01:17:25.166 --> 01:17:27.166
- Where's the Heart?
- Parker has it.

01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:31.291
But I encrypted it to my biometrics,
so it's useless without me.

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:33.333
Come on, get up.

01:17:37.625 --> 01:17:39.708
If I shoot you now, all this is over.

01:17:40.208 --> 01:17:42.875
Show you the same mercy
you showed Bailey and Yang.

01:17:48.208 --> 01:17:49.791
It's the logical play, Rachel.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:53.666
It's what the Heart would tell you to do.

01:17:56.708 --> 01:17:57.750
I'm not like you.

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:02.166
On your feet.

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:06.166
We need to keep moving.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.541
So, what's the plan, Keya?

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:35.708
Trying to get even with Niam Kharche
for kicking you out of the penthouse?

01:18:36.208 --> 01:18:38.833
Right. You think you know everything.

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:40.958
I bet the Heart
told you that he adopted me,

01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:43.916
lifted me out of nothing.
But did it tell you why?

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:51.750
Kharche used my parents like lab rats
in a medical trial, and it killed them.

01:18:53.375 --> 01:18:56.458
He covered everything up and took me in
thinking he was doing me a favor,

01:18:56.458 --> 01:18:58.791
but I let him think that
because I knew one day,

01:18:58.791 --> 01:19:02.041
I'd be strong enough to make him pay
for what he did to my parents.

01:19:02.541 --> 01:19:04.416
So, you get to tear the whole world down?

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:05.916
Oh, this is not just for me.

01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:07.708
It's for people like me.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:10.375
Parker's gonna destroy the Charter.

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:13.375
I've got my whole naughty list,
and we're going to expose them all.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.916
With no thought of what comes next.

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:18.833
You're a child.

01:19:19.666 --> 01:19:21.416
And you think the Charter's any better?

01:19:21.958 --> 01:19:24.291
Just because they saved you
doesn't make them good.

01:19:25.833 --> 01:19:27.500
You think I didn't look into you?

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.375
How many schools
did you get kicked out of?

01:19:31.875 --> 01:19:33.875
Seven? Eight?

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:37.708
Always a rebel. Always a problem.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.916
Violent, alone, helpless.

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:42.833
- Stop.
- Until the Charter comes along, right?

01:19:42.833 --> 01:19:45.541
And gives you that discipline
that you so clearly crave.

01:19:45.541 --> 01:19:47.791
But did they take you in
because you were good?

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:50.583
- Or because you were broken?
- Enough.

01:19:54.541 --> 01:19:55.666
Maybe I was broken.

01:19:58.458 --> 01:20:00.791
But there's a woman I know only as Nomad.

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.916
She rescued me, trained me,

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:07.666
showed me what's possible
when there's someone watching your back.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.125
Where is she now?

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:15.958
Let's go.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.583
Parker's coming for you, and I wanna have
a bigger gun when he shows up.

01:20:47.416 --> 01:20:48.625
They're headed for us.

01:20:50.041 --> 01:20:51.208
Maybe it's Parker.

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:54.375
It's definitely not the Charter.

01:20:58.458 --> 01:20:59.458
Mercenaries?

01:21:01.041 --> 01:21:04.083
Okay, let's just, um,
give them a good cover story.

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:07.541
They'll keep us alive for ransom.
We reel them in, and then bam.

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:13.541
Just to be clear,
the "bam" is for you to take them out.

01:21:15.250 --> 01:21:16.250
Yeah, I get that.

01:21:55.208 --> 01:21:57.666
<i>♪ Zombie no go go
Unless you tell 'em to go ♪</i>

01:21:57.666 --> 01:21:58.583
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:21:58.583 --> 01:22:01.708
<i>♪ Zombie no go stop

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:02.625
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:05.291

01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:06.208
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:06.208 --> 01:22:08.666
<i>♪ Zombie no go think

01:22:08.666 --> 01:22:09.791
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:13.291
<i>- ♪ Zombie, oh zombie ♪
- ♪ Zombie, oh zombie ♪</i>

01:22:13.291 --> 01:22:15.791
You know,
the Charter can take down Kharche.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.583
<i>♪ Zombie no go go
Unless you tell 'em to go ♪</i>

01:22:19.583 --> 01:22:20.500
<i>♪ Zombie</i>... <i>♪</i>

01:22:21.083 --> 01:22:23.000
Parker's way isn't the only way.

01:22:23.666 --> 01:22:24.500
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:24.500 --> 01:22:27.166
<i>♪ Zombie no go turn

01:22:27.166 --> 01:22:28.083
<i>♪ Zombie ♪</i>

01:22:28.083 --> 01:22:30.291
<i>♪ Zombie no go think
Unless you tell 'em... ♪</i>

01:23:17.458 --> 01:23:19.041
Come with me.

01:24:32.708 --> 01:24:33.750
She got away.

01:24:33.750 --> 01:24:35.083
That wasn't the deal.

01:24:35.666 --> 01:24:39.083
Killing her wasn't the deal either.
You have to pay me now.

01:24:40.666 --> 01:24:41.666
The deal changed.

01:25:42.916 --> 01:25:44.333
You're a hard woman to find.

01:25:48.166 --> 01:25:49.291
Six of Hearts.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.291
Nomad sends her best.

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:15.125
Dhawan is back with Parker.
I slipped her a tracker.

01:26:15.125 --> 01:26:17.916
They're heading north. Looping you in now.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:20.833
Hi, Rachel.

01:26:21.541 --> 01:26:24.458
Nice to hear your voice.
I was a bit worried about you.

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:26.416
Were you?

01:26:27.958 --> 01:26:30.958
Okay, got her.
They're heading towards Iceland.

01:26:33.333 --> 01:26:35.541
I take it I'm no longer compromised.

01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:38.375
Well, they have the Heart,
so we're all compromised.

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:42.416
<i>Parker's coming after the Charter,
so we're heading to a secure location.</i>

01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.875
<i>Clubs is assembling a team.</i>

01:26:43.875 --> 01:26:46.625
<i>We'll make sure they're on the ground
by the time you arrive.</i>

01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:48.000
And if we're too late?

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
Just get there as fast as you can.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.458
If they get the Heart online,
God knows what they're capable of.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.458
I'm on my way.

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:30.208
It's not impregnable,
but it's the best we've got.

01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:35.000
If the Heart wants to find us, it will.

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:43.708
Will this hunk of junk make it to Iceland?

01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:45.291
Hell yeah.

01:27:57.708 --> 01:28:00.666
Nice trick you pulled
with the facial recognition yesterday.

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:03.291
Trying to put a lock on our new toy.

01:28:04.291 --> 01:28:06.250
Would you come back for me if I hadn't?

01:28:07.416 --> 01:28:08.541
We're a team, Keya.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.083
Don't do it again.

01:28:21.541 --> 01:28:23.166
I think I have it.

01:28:23.166 --> 01:28:26.708
I know where they're going.
Reykjavik University computer lab.

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:29.875
It has a cryo-storage facility,
several floors of servers.

01:28:29.875 --> 01:28:31.541
The tracker's heading straight for it.

01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:37.250
See, Keya, don't say
I don't keep my promises.

01:28:38.208 --> 01:28:41.375
Okay, be ready.
You know your instructions.

01:28:41.875 --> 01:28:44.250
Couple of minutes,
we'll be up and running.

01:29:27.375 --> 01:29:28.208
Are we up?

01:29:32.250 --> 01:29:33.083
We're up.

01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:56.583
Is this your naughty list?

01:29:56.583 --> 01:30:00.875
Emails, texts, bank accounts. The Heart's
using my algorithm to sort through it all.

01:30:00.875 --> 01:30:03.625
So, we can find anyone?
Gain access to anything?

01:30:03.625 --> 01:30:05.708
Greatest skeleton key in the world.

01:30:07.291 --> 01:30:08.125
Show me.

01:30:14.583 --> 01:30:15.541
There it is.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:19.875
Evidence of Kharche's years of experiments
on innocents across the country.

01:30:19.875 --> 01:30:22.541
That's the truth... for the world to see.

01:30:23.458 --> 01:30:26.458
That's impressive.
But let's see what else this thing can do.

01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:28.041
Find me the Kings.

01:30:30.125 --> 01:30:31.166
What are you doing?

01:30:33.583 --> 01:30:36.541
Nancy Morrison.
King of Diamonds. Ex-CIA.

01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:40.250
The Heart tells us she's heading to
a safe house with her family.

01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:42.333
Drop the lift.

01:30:43.958 --> 01:30:44.958
Are you serious?

01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:48.166
No. Do--

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.541
You're welcome.

01:31:04.541 --> 01:31:06.458
Hang on. I have another one.

01:31:08.041 --> 01:31:09.916
I think you're gonna like this, boss.

01:31:10.416 --> 01:31:14.333
An unidentified military plane landed
at a private airfield 33 minutes ago.

01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:17.125
There.

01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:23.833
Jiang Hsu. Served 35 years
in Chinese State Security Service.

01:31:23.833 --> 01:31:26.000
The King of Clubs is here in Iceland.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:27.791
Even better. Where is he now?

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:40.500
Two minutes out.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:43.083
Sending the plans now.
Stone is on her way.

01:31:47.458 --> 01:31:50.416
We don't have time to wait.
Tell her to follow us in.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:55.083
Any news of Spades or Hearts?

01:31:55.083 --> 01:31:56.458
 Nothing yet.

01:31:58.291 --> 01:32:01.541
There were other people in that elevator.
In that lobby.

01:32:02.666 --> 01:32:03.625
Calm down, Keya.

01:32:04.791 --> 01:32:09.416
You said we were going to expose Kharche
and then the Charter, not murder them.

01:32:09.416 --> 01:32:13.750
The King of Hearts with her team.
They're in a bunker outside of London.

01:32:14.750 --> 01:32:15.583
Good.

01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:17.791
Take them out.

01:32:22.041 --> 01:32:23.375
<i>We're approaching now.</i>

01:32:23.375 --> 01:32:26.125
<i>- We'll see you on the other side.</i>
- You're going in with them?

01:32:26.125 --> 01:32:28.916
I ordered the strike on Parker.
It's only fair.

01:32:29.541 --> 01:32:32.666
You know... I would have made
the same call in Chechnya.

01:32:32.666 --> 01:32:33.916
Thanks. The right--

01:32:37.958 --> 01:32:39.125
I've lost contact.

01:32:41.583 --> 01:32:43.000
The Heart's online.

01:32:47.208 --> 01:32:48.041
No, no, no, no.

01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:55.000
We're locked in.

01:32:59.375 --> 01:33:02.166
Oh God. They've shut off
our ventilation system.

01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:03.625
No, no, no, no.

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:10.291
Jack, how long we got?

01:33:12.958 --> 01:33:16.500
At this rate, about an hour
and we're out of oxygen.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.708
The Charter never worries about
who gets in their way. Neither will we.

01:33:23.708 --> 01:33:26.541
King of Hearts is locked in.
They'll be dead in an hour.

01:33:27.041 --> 01:33:30.708
- You have to stop this, please.
- Someone has to control this power, Keya.

01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:32.708
- Why not us?
- This is not what we agreed.

01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:36.041
You're still not seeing
the bigger picture.

01:33:36.916 --> 01:33:39.041
This isn't about
some pissy little grievance you had

01:33:39.041 --> 01:33:40.916
with the bad man
who killed your mom and dad.

01:33:41.541 --> 01:33:42.750
This is about power.

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:48.000
Concentrated in the hands of the few,
of the very few who could use it for good,

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.750
who could actually make a change,
but they don't.

01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:58.875
At this moment, we are mining
trillions of pieces of data.

01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:02.208
In a matter of hours,
I will be able to take down

01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:04.166
the remaining members of the Charter.

01:34:06.083 --> 01:34:09.000
We've been used
and manipulated our whole lives.

01:34:10.083 --> 01:34:11.958
Now it's time for us to take control.

01:34:37.791 --> 01:34:38.625
Go.

01:34:46.916 --> 01:34:49.583
Clubs team are inside
the university building.

01:34:51.083 --> 01:34:52.583
What... are you doing?

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:56.833
You wanna know
how great men get power, Keya?

01:34:58.625 --> 01:35:00.166
<i>It's not because they earn it...</i>

01:35:01.958 --> 01:35:03.333
<i>or because they deserve it.</i>

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.125
It is because when the moment comes,

01:35:08.541 --> 01:35:09.375
they take it.

01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.250
Stone is one minute out.

01:35:25.916 --> 01:35:27.541
In position. We're all set.

01:35:32.166 --> 01:35:34.541
She's approaching the university.

01:35:52.625 --> 01:35:54.750
Stone, you need to get out now.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:56.166
<i>I don't have long.</i>

01:35:56.166 --> 01:35:57.083
Keya?

01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:59.625
I have a failsafe uploading.
It will disable the Heart.

01:35:59.625 --> 01:36:01.625
They won't be able
to access it without me.

01:36:01.625 --> 01:36:04.833
I'm outside. But you already know that.

01:36:04.833 --> 01:36:07.166
No, you're not. It's a trap.

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:09.375
<i>I found your tracker.</i>

01:36:09.375 --> 01:36:12.791
The lab is a decoy.
You need to get your team out now.

01:36:13.791 --> 01:36:16.291
- Why should I believe you?
- Because you were right.

01:36:16.791 --> 01:36:19.791
Okay? You told me about Parker,
and you were right about everything.

01:36:20.291 --> 01:36:22.416
My parents would have never wanted this.

01:36:22.416 --> 01:36:24.458
<i>Just please listen to me.</i>

01:36:24.458 --> 01:36:26.500
Get your team out of there right now.

01:36:36.166 --> 01:36:38.333
- Tell me where you are.
-  <i>Okay.</i>

01:36:38.333 --> 01:36:41.791
I'm sending you my coordinates.
I'll leave the back door open.

01:36:43.958 --> 01:36:44.875
Shit.

01:36:55.416 --> 01:36:58.083
I'm Nine of Hearts.
I need your radio.

01:37:01.958 --> 01:37:03.333
Go.

01:37:06.083 --> 01:37:09.041
This is Nine of Hearts.
Get out of there. It's a trap.

01:37:14.375 --> 01:37:17.541
Do you hear me?
She found the tracker. Get out of there.

01:37:24.291 --> 01:37:25.208
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:28.041
Yeah... I hear you.

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:01.041
What's going on?

01:38:02.041 --> 01:38:03.333
- Where is she?

01:38:03.333 --> 01:38:05.625
- What has she done?

01:38:06.333 --> 01:38:07.875
- How long to fix it?
- Oh.

01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:11.208
I-- Could be minutes. Could be hours.

01:38:11.708 --> 01:38:13.250
You have until I get back.

01:38:20.416 --> 01:38:21.791
 The door won't move.

01:38:22.708 --> 01:38:24.458
Damn it!

01:38:24.458 --> 01:38:26.875
There must be
an emergency override system.

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:28.750
We must have missed something.

01:38:28.750 --> 01:38:31.208
Jack, is there any way
we can get hold of Stone?

01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:33.250
No. No comms. We're still offline.

01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:37.958
Maybe-- Maybe try the landline.

01:38:50.958 --> 01:38:53.625
Okay. Okay.

01:39:21.583 --> 01:39:24.458
-  <i>Stone, thank God. Where are you?</i>
- Clubs are dead.

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:27.625
<i>University was a trap.</i>

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.791
I have new intel.

01:39:31.791 --> 01:39:32.708
A new location.

01:39:33.208 --> 01:39:34.916
We've-- We've lost Clubs?

01:39:36.791 --> 01:39:37.708
What new intel?

01:39:38.208 --> 01:39:40.250
<i>Keya. She shut down the Heart.</i>

01:39:42.416 --> 01:39:45.833
- How do you know she's not playing you?
- I don't.

01:39:49.333 --> 01:39:51.541
<i>We're gonna die in less than an hour.</i>

01:39:52.083 --> 01:39:54.291
<i>- They shut down our air supply.</i>
- What?

01:39:54.291 --> 01:39:57.333
- She shut down our air supply.
-  <i>Parker did.</i>

01:39:57.333 --> 01:39:58.833
I believe her, Nomad.

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:01.750
I'd be dead too
if I hadn't listened to her.

01:40:02.250 --> 01:40:04.458
I trust her, and you need to trust me.

01:40:07.958 --> 01:40:08.791
Fifty minutes.

01:40:11.333 --> 01:40:12.583
I can work with that.

01:40:16.166 --> 01:40:17.000
I'll see you.

01:40:24.291 --> 01:40:25.125
You too.

01:41:34.708 --> 01:41:39.125

01:41:44.333 --> 01:41:46.666

Sorry, I need your truck.

01:42:33.250 --> 01:42:35.125
I know you're in here, Keya.

01:42:38.833 --> 01:42:40.833
You know, you still have a choice.

01:42:43.750 --> 01:42:45.666
You can still be a part of this.

01:42:52.041 --> 01:42:54.166
You're only delaying the inevitable.

01:43:31.416 --> 01:43:33.916
- Would you like me to wait?
-  Definitely no.

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:35.500
But thanks!

01:43:59.958 --> 01:44:01.000
Come on, Keya.

01:44:21.541 --> 01:44:22.791
Settle down now.

01:44:23.625 --> 01:44:24.458
Conserve air.

01:44:55.875 --> 01:44:57.208
- Move.

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:02.375
Get the Heart back online.

01:45:03.125 --> 01:45:03.958
Do it!

01:45:07.416 --> 01:45:08.250
Get up.

01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:09.708
Get up!

01:45:18.541 --> 01:45:20.458
Right. Where do we start?

01:45:21.541 --> 01:45:22.375
Fingers?

01:45:22.375 --> 01:45:24.458
No, we'll be needing those. Knees?

01:45:24.458 --> 01:45:26.375
- Yeah.

01:45:26.375 --> 01:45:27.458
Last chance.

01:45:28.666 --> 01:45:30.375
Okay, I'll do it.

01:45:32.916 --> 01:45:33.750
Go on.

01:45:35.625 --> 01:45:37.041
I need to get back in there.

01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.458
The Heart has to be disconnected
and reconnected again to the servers.

01:45:41.458 --> 01:45:45.250
Any interference, the system
automatically shuts down. You know that.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:47.833
Move.

01:46:15.541 --> 01:46:19.125
This doesn't end well for you, Stone.
Take another step, and she's dead.

01:46:19.125 --> 01:46:22.333
- I don't care. I'm here for you.
-  Bullshit.

01:46:23.166 --> 01:46:25.041
You and I know that without this one,

01:46:25.041 --> 01:46:28.000
the Heart stays down
and everyone inside that bunker dies,

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
unless, of course, they're dead already.

01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:34.041
I have the Heart, and I have the Kings.
That's a winning hand.

01:46:45.125 --> 01:46:46.500
Okay. I'll put it down.

01:46:53.125 --> 01:46:55.416
Good girl. Now, kick it away.

01:46:58.583 --> 01:46:59.833
Tell me this, though.

01:47:00.750 --> 01:47:02.083
What's your point, hm?

01:47:03.208 --> 01:47:05.375
And why do you have to
kill them to make it?

01:47:06.125 --> 01:47:09.625
I've served my entire life,
Rachel, and none of it mattered.

01:47:09.625 --> 01:47:11.375
The world is still in chaos.

01:47:12.916 --> 01:47:15.125
The Heart has the power
to change everything.

01:47:15.625 --> 01:47:19.291
But the Charter are using it
to keep things exactly as they are.

01:47:19.291 --> 01:47:23.000
You don't wanna change anything.
You just wanna be the one in charge.

01:47:23.500 --> 01:47:26.416
First thing you did
with all that power was kill people.

01:47:27.041 --> 01:47:30.333
The problem
with men like you, Parker,

01:47:30.833 --> 01:47:34.041
is that your power is only ever based on
threats and violence.

01:47:34.541 --> 01:47:38.208
And when you brutalize everyone
around you, even your own team...

01:47:39.541 --> 01:47:42.416
you'll never have
the one thing I know I always will.

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:46.416
Yeah?

01:47:47.333 --> 01:47:48.833
And what is that, Rachel?

01:47:50.625 --> 01:47:52.375
Someone to watch my back.

01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:46.583
Maybe in the next life.

01:49:47.250 --> 01:49:49.833
See you when I get there.

01:50:47.125 --> 01:50:49.166
<i>Nomad, tell me you're okay.</i>

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:58.083
Is everyone still with us?

01:51:00.875 --> 01:51:04.500
Yeah, yeah.

01:51:12.166 --> 01:51:13.916
It's good to hear from you, Stone.

01:51:15.708 --> 01:51:16.625
I knew I would.

01:51:44.666 --> 01:51:45.500
Hey, Barry.

01:51:59.750 --> 01:52:00.583
What's this?

01:52:01.083 --> 01:52:01.958
I don't know.

01:52:01.958 --> 01:52:03.375
It's beautiful.

01:52:03.375 --> 01:52:05.333
But what is it? Who's it from?

01:52:20.541 --> 01:52:21.791
Looking good.

01:52:23.083 --> 01:52:26.541
I decided to embrace the cliché
and use my time in jail to get ripped.

01:52:28.583 --> 01:52:29.958
You've had worse goals.

01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:32.583
So my lawyers tell me.

01:52:35.416 --> 01:52:37.000
And you? Back with the Charter?

01:52:38.708 --> 01:52:41.625
Yeah, I'm back with the Charter.

01:52:43.333 --> 01:52:44.750
But on two conditions.

01:52:46.791 --> 01:52:48.458
The Heart's an amazing tool.

01:52:49.416 --> 01:52:50.666
But that's all it is.

01:52:51.833 --> 01:52:55.583
If we only follow the odds, we'll
never do anything in spite of the odds.

01:52:56.583 --> 01:52:59.125
And what if the odds
tell you to do nothing?

01:53:01.166 --> 01:53:02.666
That's when they send me.

01:53:06.791 --> 01:53:08.166
What's the second thing?

01:53:10.083 --> 01:53:11.458
I liked my team, Keya.

01:53:12.250 --> 01:53:13.083
I miss them.

01:53:14.833 --> 01:53:18.541
I wanna surround myself with people
who will change the world for good.

01:53:35.250 --> 01:53:36.375
How we doing, Jack?

01:53:37.041 --> 01:53:38.583
<i>Good news and bad news.</i>

01:53:38.583 --> 01:53:41.875
<i>The good news, I've scouted the square,
and your plan just might work.</i>

01:53:43.375 --> 01:53:44.333
<i>The bad news--</i>

01:53:45.458 --> 01:53:49.208
Uh, they were out of oat milk.

01:53:49.208 --> 01:53:51.083
- Jack.

01:53:51.083 --> 01:53:52.958
What? You told me to blend in.

01:53:54.708 --> 01:53:56.291
Did we get into the power grid?

01:53:57.291 --> 01:54:00.750
Yeah. It wasn't that hard,
because their password was "password."

01:54:02.791 --> 01:54:03.625
Your coffee.

01:54:04.458 --> 01:54:05.458
Thank you.

01:54:08.375 --> 01:54:09.333
This is cold.

01:54:09.333 --> 01:54:12.541
Um, you know we can still
throw you in jail, right?

01:54:14.708 --> 01:54:15.541
Hey.

01:54:17.208 --> 01:54:18.166
Stay in the van.

01:54:19.583 --> 01:54:21.208
We stay in the van, boss.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:24.541

Go give them the bam.

01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:39.625
Always.
