14:10.142 --> 14:12.102

The president's helicopter
was not shot down.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.231

14:16.315 --> 14:17.733

they were doing 130 knots

14:24.323 --> 14:26.950

speed when they hit.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.410

45:35.027 --> 45:37.196
Well, she found it.

45:37.279 --> 45:39.489
She listened to
the voice recorder.

45:39.573 --> 45:42.576
It's crystal clear.

45:42.659 --> 45:46.205
The helicopter
wasn't shot down.

45:46.288 --> 45:48.665
It crashed because
of mechanical failure.

45:50.918 --> 45:52.753
Why haven't you told anyone?

45:52.836 --> 45:55.088
(sighs)

45:55.172 --> 45:56.965
'Cause the flight recorder
was taken from her

45:57.049 --> 45:59.676
by a Russian agent.

45:59.760 --> 46:01.970
So we just have her word.

SAUL: No.

46:05.682 --> 46:07.392
(sighs) I spoke
to Ambassador Makarov.

46:07.476 --> 46:08.769
Yeah, and what did he say?

46:08.852 --> 46:10.103
Officially,
they don't have it.

46:10.187 --> 46:12.231
Unofficially,
they're not giving it back.

46:19.905 --> 46:22.741
we bought ourselves
some goodwill

46:22.824 --> 46:25.035
getting the Special Ops team
released.

46:25.118 --> 46:27.829
I can build on that with Hayes,
keep the temperature down,

46:27.913 --> 46:30.582
the diplomatic pressure up,
try to stall,

46:30.666 --> 46:32.334

46:32.417 --> 46:34.378
You start talking
about Carrie Mathison

46:34.461 --> 46:36.588
and Russian agents
and vanished flight recorders,

46:36.672 --> 46:39.424
and any credibility
you have left here is gone.

46:39.508 --> 46:41.844
I know.

46:42.886 --> 46:45.097

She'd lost her mind.

47:02.197 --> 47:05.534
