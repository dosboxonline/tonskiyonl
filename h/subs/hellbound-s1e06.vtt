WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.346
You should've stayed with them,
considering how serious the situation is.

00:14.639 --> 00:16.099
Are you sure they're at home?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.309
Listen, Mr. Bae.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.770
The New Truth and the Arrowhead
are working together.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.814
The Arrowhead raided my office last night,

00:22.897 --> 00:24.899
and the New Truth deacons were with them.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.318
If they find out that your baby
received the decree,

00:27.402 --> 00:29.362
you and your wife will be in danger.

00:30.405 --> 00:33.074
I'll have to call you back in a minute.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.792
YOUNGJAE

00:46.921 --> 00:48.965
-Ms. Song Sohyun?
-Yes?

00:49.049 --> 00:50.216
Please come this way.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.349
Your call cannot be connected…

01:00.435 --> 01:02.437
SOHYUN
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

01:04.856 --> 01:08.151
YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE NEW TRUTH, DID YOU?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.614
PLEASE CALL AS SOON AS YOU SEE THIS

01:25.001 --> 01:26.461
I'M SORRY, YOUNGJAE

01:26.544 --> 01:30.090
I NEED TO ASK THE NEW TRUTH DEACONS
WHY OUR BABY RECEIVED THE DECREE

01:44.771 --> 01:45.688
Good morning.

01:47.232 --> 01:48.733
I'm Deacon Yuji.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.654
I heard you have something
to discuss with me.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.128
Please take a look at this.

02:09.796 --> 02:14.300
Ms. Min, my wife said
she went to the New Truth.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.469
You must get your wife
and baby out of there.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.304
We'll be there as soon as possible.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.222
Okay.

02:25.812 --> 02:29.899
Song Sohyun's baby.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.695
In three days…

02:34.779 --> 02:37.907
-at 9:30 p.m.…
-Deacon Yuji.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.201
Has there ever been
a mistake in the decree?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.704
…you are bound for Hell.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.330
My baby was just born.

02:46.207 --> 02:47.959
What sin could my baby have committed?

02:49.460 --> 02:53.840
People here study all the cases
of demonstrations and decrees.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.343
Something has gone wrong, right?

02:58.803 --> 03:00.722
Even deacons don't know…

03:02.765 --> 03:04.142
about all the cases out there.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.729
Let us discuss this internally.

03:08.771 --> 03:10.398
Could you please wait a moment?

03:11.357 --> 03:12.400
Okay.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.088
Make sure the woman in Room Four
doesn't leave the premises.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.131
Yes, sir.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.177
Tell Deacon Sacheong to come in
immediately and keep an eye on her.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.637
Yes, sir.

03:45.516 --> 03:49.229
Chairman Kim, I need you to call
an urgent committee meeting.

04:39.779 --> 04:41.698
YOUNGJAE

04:44.951 --> 04:47.328
Your call cannot be connected…

04:56.587 --> 05:01.384
Song Sohyun's baby.

05:01.467 --> 05:05.179
In three days,

05:06.097 --> 05:11.102
at 9:30 p.m.,

05:11.185 --> 05:16.024
you are bound for Hell.

05:18.860 --> 05:20.695
Where are the mother and the baby?

05:21.195 --> 05:23.031
They are in a consulting room.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.285
What do you think we should do?

05:29.245 --> 05:30.079
Anyone?

05:33.207 --> 05:37.420
It's hard for me to suggest
anything right now.

05:38.421 --> 05:39.797
But one thing is clear.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.758
That video.

05:41.841 --> 05:44.427
If people find out about it,

05:44.510 --> 05:48.848
they will start to have doubts
about the New Truth and our doctrine.

05:50.016 --> 05:50.892
You're right.

05:56.647 --> 05:59.984
First, isolate the baby
and the mother separately.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.780
Find out who else knows about the video.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.490
Bring them to isolation.

06:06.074 --> 06:06.949
Yes, sir.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.007
THE NEW TRUTH

06:23.591 --> 06:25.802
YOUNGJAE: SOHYUN, THEY'RE GOING
TO HARM YOU AND THE BABY.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.928
GET OUT OF THERE RIGHT NOW!

06:31.808 --> 06:32.809
Where's the mother?

06:32.892 --> 06:33.851
She's in Room Four.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.319
You're late. Did she get back to you?

06:44.153 --> 06:46.030
No. I can't get a hold of her.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.408
The consulting rooms
are in Building B over there.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.708
Don't cry, my dear.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.253
Don't cry.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.675
Hello, Ms. Song. I'm Deacon Sacheong.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.678
We'd like to give you
a detailed explanation on the matter.

07:09.303 --> 07:10.555
Please come with us.

07:10.638 --> 07:12.598
Oh, my. The baby's crying so much.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.184
-Let me take the baby.
-No, there's no need--

07:15.268 --> 07:16.769
It's okay. I'm good with babies.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.354
-Give me the baby.
-No, I've got it!

07:18.438 --> 07:19.939
Please get your bag and come out.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.610
Excuse me! Give me back my baby!

07:27.155 --> 07:28.781
Reporters.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.867
Chairman Kim has other priorities today,

07:30.950 --> 07:33.202
so I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave.

07:33.703 --> 07:38.624
We are still looking into Professor Gong's
case and the Arrowhead's statement.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.543
We don't have an official statement yet.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.004
The Arrowhead mentioned
the New Truth in their statement,

07:43.087 --> 07:44.714
but you are not commenting on it?

07:44.797 --> 07:47.175
The Arrowhead staged a demonstration
and punished victims.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.135
Shouldn't you at least comment on it?

07:49.218 --> 07:52.346
We have no plan to comment on
any of the issues at the moment.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.557
I would like to ask you to leave now.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.351
Deacon, are you refusing
to comment on the issues?

07:57.435 --> 07:59.562
-Correct. You should leave.
-Deacon, give us a comment.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.314
-Please leave.
-Give us a comment.

08:01.397 --> 08:02.315
Deacon!

08:17.872 --> 08:20.208
I received the decree!

08:20.291 --> 08:21.125
Who is that?

08:21.209 --> 08:24.504
I'm a sinner who's bound for Hell
in ten minutes.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.255
-Take pictures. Follow him.
-Who is that?

08:26.339 --> 08:29.717
I'd like to confess my sins
to the chairman this instant…

08:31.469 --> 08:33.095
and face the demonstration.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.056
-Get him!
-Right here, right now!

08:35.139 --> 08:38.893
-No, up here! I'll face it up here!
-Take him down!

08:49.028 --> 08:50.655
A man is causing a scene in the lobby

08:50.738 --> 08:52.907
saying that his demonstration
is in ten minutes.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.493
In ten minutes?

08:57.286 --> 09:00.373
I'll go check what's going on.
Keep a close eye on the mother.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.457
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.670
Wait.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.672
Give me back my baby.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.048
Get her off me!

09:09.131 --> 09:11.634
What's wrong with you?
Give me back my baby!

09:11.717 --> 09:14.428
Why are you doing this?
My baby! Let go of me!

09:14.512 --> 09:16.013
Get her out of here!

09:16.097 --> 09:17.306
Give me back my baby!

09:17.890 --> 09:19.642
Get your hands off her, you bastard!

09:21.435 --> 09:22.812
Let go, you son of a--

09:24.939 --> 09:25.898
Hey, go get her.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.206
Get away from here with that damn baby!

09:42.790 --> 09:44.542
My baby…

09:50.256 --> 09:51.632
Sohyun! Stop!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.801
You bastard.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.928
-You arrogant bastard…
-Sohyun!

09:56.012 --> 09:56.929
Oh, no!

09:57.972 --> 09:59.056
Give me back my baby!

09:59.140 --> 10:02.768
Get her off me! Come on, stop her!

10:02.852 --> 10:04.145
What are you doing?

10:09.650 --> 10:10.526
Sohyun!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.694
Die, you bitch.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.334
Call security right now!

10:29.587 --> 10:30.463
Hurry!

10:35.968 --> 10:40.556
Chairman Kim!
Please accept this sinner's plea.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.351
Chairman Kim, where are you?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.020
They're coming.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.817
They're coming!

11:01.494 --> 11:03.204
Drag him out of here right now!

11:03.287 --> 11:04.914
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir. Grab him.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.254
I'll drive.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.978
Stop them!

11:28.062 --> 11:30.439
Stop the car!

11:56.048 --> 11:57.466
Block the entrance!

12:24.285 --> 12:26.036
Will that man in the lobby be okay?

12:26.912 --> 12:29.540
They can't do anything to him now
because of the reporters.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.625
He'll be under our protection afterwards.

13:18.088 --> 13:18.923
Chairman…

13:19.757 --> 13:21.967
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to find them.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.095
What did you say?

13:25.179 --> 13:26.305
What?

13:26.388 --> 13:27.473
What?

13:28.057 --> 13:32.311
You've got some nerve, carrying on
like that after what you've done!

13:37.274 --> 13:40.486
You had them, and let them
slip right through your hands.

13:40.569 --> 13:43.739
How are you going to catch them now?
Do you have a plan in mind?

13:45.741 --> 13:47.326
Say something!

13:53.207 --> 13:56.335
Do you have any idea what you've done?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.008
The demonstration is tomorrow.

14:04.176 --> 14:06.554
What do you think will happen
if people find out about it?

14:06.637 --> 14:09.306
Pandemonium!
It'll be the end of the world!

14:09.390 --> 14:13.561
They will think God is a joke whose
actions are not governed by principles.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.273
What do you think will happen
in a world without principles?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.275
It will come to an end!

14:21.193 --> 14:24.154
You are the ones
who brought the world to an end.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.244
All right.

14:31.871 --> 14:35.875
From now on, you must
report every little thing to me.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.627
Make use of the Arrowhead.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.840
We need to stop the world from collapsing.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.843
You may leave.

14:50.431 --> 14:53.601
CHAIRMAN KIM JEONGCHIL

15:03.360 --> 15:06.196
JEONGDAM GROCERY STORE

15:17.374 --> 15:19.418
Can we trust this person?

15:19.501 --> 15:22.087
One of our members in this area
referred me to him.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.758
He received the decree long ago
and is waiting for his demonstration.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.093
We should stay here for now.

16:46.922 --> 16:50.884
Hello, Ms. Min. I was surprised
to hear you were coming.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.553
Please come in.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.146
You've come to such
a humble place as this.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.313
Please have a seat.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.108
Would you like some coffee?

17:06.191 --> 17:08.527
I have some instant coffee mix.

17:08.610 --> 17:11.280
-Sounds great. Thank you.
-All right. Please have a seat.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.711
Ms. Song, we only have one day.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.716
Your baby would mean a lot
to the countless victims of the New Truth.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.636
I regret to suggest something like this,

17:35.304 --> 17:38.098
but if you put off
making a decision any longer,

17:38.182 --> 17:41.852
the New Truth could barge in any minute
and harm the baby and both of you.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.064
They could commit murder
without batting an eyelid.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.691
You have to make a decision now.

17:48.692 --> 17:49.902
Here's your coffee.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.575
Poor baby.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.457
I heard the baby received the decree.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.043
How could the baby

18:06.627 --> 18:09.713
have committed any sins?

18:11.131 --> 18:13.467
The same goes for me.

18:14.802 --> 18:18.097
I was a follower of the New Truth.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.434
I lived by their doctrine
more faithfully than anyone.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.354
But after receiving the decree,

18:26.730 --> 18:30.317
I couldn't help but think that
I may have committed sins without knowing.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.653
The thought tormented me.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.697
Anyone could die.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.116
Everyone dies eventually.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.660
They could die of an illness
or in an accident.

18:40.828 --> 18:43.997
But the fact that I'm bound for Hell…

18:45.666 --> 18:49.711
It makes me hate myself so much.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.971
Your baby is proof
that I didn't do anything wrong.

19:00.430 --> 19:04.852
Your baby proves
that I didn't do anything wrong.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.282
Do I even have a choice?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.495
It seems that none of us…

19:25.581 --> 19:27.875
has the right to make our own decisions.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.301
I'm going to upload a video statement
about the baby receiving the decree.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.970
We have to make it reach
as many people as possible.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.890
Oh, I can help you with that.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.351
I used to do live streaming online.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.478
I quit after receiving the decree,

19:48.562 --> 19:51.773
but many people will watch it
if we upload it to my channel.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.858
Hold on a second.

19:52.941 --> 19:55.569
I still have all the equipment.
I'll bring it out.

19:55.652 --> 19:58.363
Where have I put it? Oh, I remember.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.338
Hello.

20:14.421 --> 20:18.800
I'm Min Hyejin and I was formerly
a lawyer at Sodo Law Firm.

20:20.052 --> 20:24.097
What I am about to share with you
is a video of a newborn baby

20:24.181 --> 20:26.683
receiving the decree from an angel.

20:30.187 --> 20:34.399
Song Sohyun's baby.

20:36.193 --> 20:38.987
I understand that this video

20:39.071 --> 20:41.114
will confuse many of you.

20:42.449 --> 20:48.247
What could a newborn baby
have done to face God's punishment?

20:50.916 --> 20:54.711
The baby's demonstration
is at 9:30 p.m. tomorrow.

20:56.546 --> 21:00.425
We will broadcast the demonstration
of this innocent baby live tomorrow.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.970
We'll leave it up to you
to interpret its meaning.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.807
And I urge the New Truth
to stop deluding people

21:06.890 --> 21:09.768
by calling this catastrophe
God's punishment.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.069
She's done it.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.240
What do you think we should do?

21:24.825 --> 21:26.326
Well,

21:26.410 --> 21:29.663
maybe it's time for us to adopt
the concept of original sin.

21:30.163 --> 21:33.542
We can say that humans are born sinners--

21:33.625 --> 21:35.585
That is not acceptable!

21:36.169 --> 21:41.300
The New Truth was able
to build influence quickly

21:41.383 --> 21:45.929
because we made people understand
why some sinners were bound for Hell.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.848
As soon as we adopt that concept,

21:47.931 --> 21:51.143
people will start to wonder
how we are different from Protestants.

21:51.268 --> 21:54.980
-We'll lose our influence in no time.
-Then what? You have a better idea?

21:55.063 --> 21:56.315
Chairman.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.984
We still have some time.

21:59.067 --> 22:02.154
How about we claim
that the video has been manipulated

22:02.237 --> 22:04.406
and see how the public responds to it?

22:04.489 --> 22:07.284
The demonstration is yet to be held.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.912
What if they really broadcast
the baby's demonstration?

22:10.996 --> 22:11.997
What will we say then?

22:12.080 --> 22:14.416
We should claim that they staged it.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.043
Then people will start to say

22:16.126 --> 22:18.837
that we also staged all
the demonstrations we've aired so far.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.132
You seem eager to find
faults in the ideas of others.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.718
We are here to come up with a solution.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.428
Are you calling me a nitpicker?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.221
Original sin is the safest option.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.975
-Nothing out of line with our doctrine.
-Your suggestion is unreasonable.

22:32.559 --> 22:35.354
-Do you even know what original sin is?
-Think before you speak!

22:35.437 --> 22:37.564
-I don't even drink apple juice.
-Unbelievable.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.399
-Let's calm down.
-Come up with a solution!

22:39.483 --> 22:41.985
-Talk about the facts.
-We need a fundamental solution!

22:49.826 --> 22:53.663
JEONGDAM GROCERY STORE

22:53.747 --> 22:54.623
Yes.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.584
Okay. One moment.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.586
Mr. Bae.

23:04.633 --> 23:08.428
This is one of our members
who'll help you and your wife seek asylum.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.348
You won't be able to take
a lot of things with you.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.475
But let them know
if there's anything you need.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.852
They'll try to accommodate
as much as possible.

23:19.022 --> 23:20.565
What about the demonstration?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.777
We can't go far
because it could be dangerous.

23:23.860 --> 23:27.572
We found a secluded place nearby
to minimize collateral damage.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.866
Our people will be here soon.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.330
Hello?

23:44.506 --> 23:47.092
You don't have to be there
for the demonstration.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.052
We'll take care of everything.

23:53.140 --> 23:54.391
At first,

23:57.894 --> 24:01.231
I couldn't stand all the crying.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.151
It was horrifying.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.154
I didn't know why…

24:09.656 --> 24:11.992
or what the baby was trying to tell me.

24:13.660 --> 24:18.498
Babies cry even if they are
slightly uncomfortable, right?

24:20.876 --> 24:26.465
They cry when they are hungry,
sleepy, or when it's too cold or too hot.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.052
All they can do is cry.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.474
But now, I see…

24:38.393 --> 24:39.519
that it was…

24:42.147 --> 24:43.732
a cry for help.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.694
That's why the baby was crying.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.990
Because my baby wants to live.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.913
The baby was crying for my help.

25:00.832 --> 25:01.833
It's the first time…

25:04.503 --> 25:08.256
that anyone has wanted my help so badly.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.386
No one has ever told me
that I'm their only hope

25:15.847 --> 25:17.390
other than my baby.

25:22.521 --> 25:23.939
I'll stay with my baby

25:26.066 --> 25:27.734
until the very end.

25:31.738 --> 25:32.822
Understood.

25:41.414 --> 25:44.292
I… I need to step out to get some things.

25:44.793 --> 25:47.045
-Is there anything you need?
-No, thank you.

25:47.754 --> 25:48.713
All right.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.988
Chairman Kim Jeongchil
is planning on appointing deacons.

26:13.071 --> 26:14.781
How?! What's the basis to decide

26:14.864 --> 26:19.119
who qualifies and who doesn't
to be appointed as a deacon?

26:19.661 --> 26:22.038
There is no one else in this world

26:22.122 --> 26:24.624
that is as faithful to God's will
as the Arrowhead.

26:25.208 --> 26:30.046
The Arrowhead won't stop
keeping a watchful eye on you! Why?

26:31.131 --> 26:35.802
To make sure if you remain faithful
to God's will or not!

26:37.387 --> 26:39.306
This is it for today's broadcast.

26:39.389 --> 26:43.643
The Arrowhead!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.339
What is it? Is he on the phone?

27:12.422 --> 27:13.632
Yes, he is.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.684
Mr. Lee Dongwook?
Chairman Kim Jeongchil of the New Truth.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.896
Are you really Chairman Kim?

27:27.979 --> 27:29.147
Yes, I am.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.901
And I'm not alone.
I have the entire committee with me

27:32.984 --> 27:34.569
to hear what you have to say.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.197
You said Min Hyejin
is at your place, correct?

27:37.697 --> 27:39.741
All of them? To what do I owe this honor?

27:42.285 --> 27:43.453
Chairman Kim,

27:43.953 --> 27:45.580
listen to me.

27:46.956 --> 27:52.754
I was a faithful follower of the New Truth

27:53.713 --> 27:56.091
even before you became the chairman.

27:57.217 --> 28:01.930
I had been loyal to the New Truth
since Chairman Jung founded it.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.474
You know,

28:05.433 --> 28:08.186
you may think you are better than me,

28:09.229 --> 28:12.691
but I know God's will better
than any of you in that room!

28:13.525 --> 28:15.694
Okay, I see.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.657
Being a deacon or a committee member

28:20.740 --> 28:23.785
doesn't mean they are closer to God.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.995
We are just a group of people

28:26.079 --> 28:30.125
who try to come up with a better way
of delivering God's message to people.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.668
I know that!

28:34.087 --> 28:36.047
Don't patronize me.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.006
Got it?

28:37.090 --> 28:39.968
Please don't get me wrong.
I have no intention of patronizing you.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.598
Chairman Kim, listen to me carefully

28:46.266 --> 28:49.269
and think about what God is trying to say.

28:51.104 --> 28:55.650
I received the decree three years ago.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.943
I'm bound for Hell.

28:58.486 --> 28:59.988
But…

29:00.071 --> 29:01.906
I have never done anything

29:01.990 --> 29:04.701
that goes against God's will
stated in your doctrine.

29:05.201 --> 29:08.246
I never told this to Sodo people,

29:09.289 --> 29:13.501
but do you know when my demonstration
will be held according to the decree?

29:16.588 --> 29:17.589
Today.

29:18.882 --> 29:19.841
It's today.

29:21.259 --> 29:27.098
But Min Hyejin and the baby
came to my place the day before.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.058
It turns out my demonstration will be

29:30.101 --> 29:32.854
five minutes after the baby's.

29:35.523 --> 29:38.359
What do you think this means?

29:38.443 --> 29:39.694
What is He trying to say?

29:40.278 --> 29:42.864
Well, what you told us
is indeed surprising.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.073
-Chairman.
-I think…

29:44.574 --> 29:46.659
YOU ARE THE MESSIAH

29:52.582 --> 29:54.459
It's an absolute message.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.419
I think it shows

29:56.920 --> 29:59.714
that God sometimes makes mistakes.

29:59.798 --> 30:05.470
And that He is trying to correct them.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.807
God somehow made a mistake

30:08.890 --> 30:11.142
and addressed the decree to a baby.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.686
What would happen if people find out?

30:13.770 --> 30:15.897
It'll cause great chaos.

30:15.980 --> 30:21.820
Maybe He is trying to cover up His mistake
with your demonstration, Mr. Lee.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.282
Mr. Lee, you've been chosen
to cover up God's mistake,

30:26.366 --> 30:30.453
and He will forever be indebted to you.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.209
You are to take on the most important role

30:37.669 --> 30:39.587
to strengthen His message.

30:43.174 --> 30:44.342
Mr. Lee,

30:45.426 --> 30:47.011
you are the Messiah.

30:55.228 --> 30:56.271
I knew it.

30:57.605 --> 30:58.815
I knew it.

31:00.984 --> 31:03.361
WE NEED TO FIND OUT HIS LOCATION

31:05.029 --> 31:06.406
Mr. Lee. I'm sorry.

31:06.489 --> 31:10.618
I should call you Messiah from now on.

31:10.702 --> 31:15.164
Where are you right now, sir?
We will help you do God's work.

31:16.583 --> 31:17.667
Help me?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.753
Who do you think you are?

31:21.921 --> 31:24.215
God has given me this mission.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.009
God has chosen me to do His work.

31:26.509 --> 31:30.430
I will never let you deacons
steal my thunder ever again!

31:30.930 --> 31:32.307
Listen.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.559
I'll kindly leave you a clue,

31:35.310 --> 31:37.812
so you can try all you want to find me.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.112
Right, a clue.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.331
What the hell?

31:56.414 --> 31:59.083
I even called him the Messiah!

32:01.544 --> 32:02.670
Chairman Kim,

32:02.754 --> 32:05.798
we can trace the location
of his last call to find him.

32:05.882 --> 32:08.343
We can ask an Arrowhead
who works at a telecomm company.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.094
As soon as you get the location,

32:10.178 --> 32:13.097
take whomever you need with you
and head there!

32:13.181 --> 32:16.809
I'll tell the police that we need
their help in finding a sinner on the run.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.646
All right, everyone. Get moving! Go!

32:57.850 --> 32:58.851
Chairman Kim,

32:58.935 --> 33:01.938
Lee Dongwook made his last call
near a supermarket in Seongnam.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.357
We requested cooperation
from the police in the jurisdiction.

33:04.440 --> 33:06.734
I don't care where he was.
Go get him right now!

33:06.818 --> 33:07.986
Go!

33:09.821 --> 33:11.072
We located Lee Dongwook.

33:11.656 --> 33:13.741
Contact the deacons in Seongnam.
Get moving!

33:13.825 --> 33:14.742
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

33:27.171 --> 33:28.589
Yes, that's the place.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.800
Park your car
in the underground parking lot.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.343
Please hurry.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.848
They're almost here.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.574
SIWON CLEANING SERVICE

34:13.468 --> 34:14.635
What's wrong?

34:15.344 --> 34:16.345
One moment.

34:36.074 --> 34:37.950
-Ms. Min.
-Yes.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.744
I'll go check on them.

34:40.661 --> 34:41.496
Hold on.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.542
Take it with you.

34:59.138 --> 35:01.307
I have to show everyone.

35:04.477 --> 35:06.521
I want to show them something.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.530
Please seal off this area.

35:15.613 --> 35:16.697
Yes, sir.

35:16.781 --> 35:18.783
Search thoroughly.

35:22.620 --> 35:23.996
Get moving!

36:09.625 --> 36:11.002
What happened?

36:12.336 --> 36:13.588
Hang in there.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.256
Can you hear me?

36:36.277 --> 36:38.237
The time is near.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.655
Look at me.

36:39.739 --> 36:40.865
Look!

36:43.701 --> 36:45.620
I guess you don't recognize me.

36:47.121 --> 36:50.583
I used to be a big shot in the Arrowhead.

36:52.084 --> 36:53.169
Why…

36:54.295 --> 36:55.963
Why are you suddenly doing this?

36:57.506 --> 36:59.425
You received the decree too.

36:59.508 --> 37:00.426
You're right.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.846
I will be subjected to the demonstration

37:03.930 --> 37:06.140
five minutes after your baby.

37:07.141 --> 37:09.143
I'm the one to cover up God's mistake.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.521
Would you like to hear what my plan is?

37:12.605 --> 37:15.358
Firstly, I'm going to kill you here

37:16.192 --> 37:19.654
and kill your wife
and Min Hyejin upstairs.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.741
Then your baby's demonstration
will be in my room.

37:23.824 --> 37:26.619
Within five minutes,
I will get rid of the body

37:27.161 --> 37:28.955
and be subjected to the demonstration.

37:29.038 --> 37:32.625
Then people won't be sure
who was subjected to the demonstration

37:32.708 --> 37:34.585
or what happened to the baby.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.671
They will be confused.

37:39.548 --> 37:44.887
Come to think of it, I didn't know
God could be so damn despicable.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.847
How could He make a mistake?

37:47.682 --> 37:48.516
How?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.936
And He's chosen me
to cover up His mistake?

37:54.981 --> 37:55.856
Wait.

37:58.317 --> 38:00.569
I don't understand what you're saying.

38:03.030 --> 38:04.115
But please calm down.

38:06.826 --> 38:08.452
Come to your senses.

38:08.536 --> 38:09.412
What do you mean?

38:09.912 --> 38:13.791
My mind has never been clearer.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.420
I can see clearly why I was born
and why I am dying.

38:17.503 --> 38:20.423
Not many people get to understand that.

38:22.675 --> 38:23.968
I am the one…

38:26.304 --> 38:29.348
who is closest to God.

38:41.402 --> 38:42.403
Sohyun!

38:43.362 --> 38:44.447
Sohyun, run!

38:45.781 --> 38:46.866
Ms. Min!

39:19.190 --> 39:20.775
-Come here!
-Let go of me!

39:50.971 --> 39:51.972
Everyone.

39:55.142 --> 39:56.560
There is something…

39:58.479 --> 40:00.648
I need to show you all.

40:04.777 --> 40:05.945
This is my baby…

40:08.823 --> 40:11.158
who is about to be subjected to

40:12.701 --> 40:14.078
the demonstration.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.162
A baby?

40:15.746 --> 40:18.249
Please stay and witness the moment.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.835
-That's not right.
-How could a baby…

40:23.754 --> 40:24.672
What?

40:25.506 --> 40:27.508
-They've been located.
-Deacon Yuji.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.343
Please check this out.

40:31.595 --> 40:32.638
This is near here.

40:32.721 --> 40:34.682
BABY SUBJECT, REAL-TIME
BABY DEMONSTRATION, INFANT

40:35.558 --> 40:38.102
-Head there now.
-Get moving!

40:49.822 --> 40:51.198
Poor baby…

40:59.665 --> 41:00.749
My baby…

41:02.835 --> 41:04.086
I will…

41:06.797 --> 41:08.841
I will be with you until the end.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.186
How much farther?

41:21.729 --> 41:22.813
Almost there.

41:27.193 --> 41:30.696
I don't have time for this!

41:30.779 --> 41:34.241
Let go of me! Let go! Damn it!

41:36.202 --> 41:37.995
You're a mere mortal!

41:38.078 --> 41:41.373
Die!

42:49.692 --> 42:50.734
Sohyun!

43:10.588 --> 43:11.797
Sohyun!

44:04.850 --> 44:06.018
It's going to be okay.

44:09.313 --> 44:10.397
No.

45:48.912 --> 45:50.247
Oh my…

45:51.457 --> 45:53.417
-What is he doing?
-What a relief.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.329
What the hell?

46:38.420 --> 46:42.966
The message is too complicated
for me to understand.

46:43.550 --> 46:44.676
You bastard.

46:48.680 --> 46:51.600
What the hell are you
trying to tell me, you asshole?

46:55.270 --> 46:56.355
Carry on?

46:58.482 --> 47:01.109
Okay, I'll carry on with the plan.

47:47.865 --> 47:48.824
Wait.

50:07.754 --> 50:10.424
Oh, my goodness.

50:34.865 --> 50:35.907
Get her!

50:40.620 --> 50:41.872
Get out of the way!

50:41.955 --> 50:42.914
Step aside!

50:43.790 --> 50:44.708
Move!

50:45.459 --> 50:46.293
Move!

50:48.879 --> 50:50.047
Get out of the way now!

50:51.381 --> 50:52.382
Move.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.301
-Get out of the way!
-Move!

50:55.343 --> 50:57.262
You are going against God's will.

50:57.345 --> 50:58.764
Get out of the way now!

50:59.723 --> 51:03.060
Get out of the way!

51:03.143 --> 51:04.102
Stop it!

51:04.770 --> 51:06.313
You pathetic crooks.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.610
What did you say?

51:11.693 --> 51:12.778
Enough is enough.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.363
You are all liars.

51:21.036 --> 51:22.245
What did you just call me?

51:23.789 --> 51:25.040
What did you say?

51:28.210 --> 51:29.044
Hey.

51:29.544 --> 51:32.047
You disregard God's principles

51:32.130 --> 51:34.841
and go against God's will.

51:35.675 --> 51:38.095
Who are you to call me a crook?

51:38.178 --> 51:40.764
How dare you!

51:40.847 --> 51:43.558
How dare you!

52:02.661 --> 52:05.914
What are you still doing here?
Go get that bitch. Damn it.

52:06.998 --> 52:07.958
Deacon Yuji.

52:09.709 --> 52:12.212
You are under arrest for battery.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.297
You have the right to remain silent.

52:15.632 --> 52:18.218
-You have the right to an attorney.
-What are you doing?

52:18.885 --> 52:19.886
Come on.

52:20.428 --> 52:21.847
What the hell are you saying?

52:22.639 --> 52:25.058
Do you have any idea
what you're doing right now?

52:25.142 --> 52:28.854
Do you know what it means
if God acts without logic?

52:29.729 --> 52:31.231
It means the end of the world.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.859
More sinners will ruin the world.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.822
The victims of those sinners
will hold you responsible for everything.

52:38.905 --> 52:42.951
You are the ones who
are helping the sinners to sin.

52:43.535 --> 52:44.786
Shame on you.

52:45.370 --> 52:47.038
Shame on you!

52:47.706 --> 52:51.626
You disregard God's principles
and go against God's will.

52:51.710 --> 52:53.461
-Who are you to…
-Let's head back.

53:22.824 --> 53:25.493
Please take the main road
and drive as far away as possible.

53:49.976 --> 53:52.270
The main road is straight ahead.

53:52.354 --> 53:55.023
The police set up a checkpoint
on that street.

53:55.106 --> 53:56.524
I saw it on my way here,

53:57.275 --> 53:58.235
Ms. Min Hyejin.

54:00.779 --> 54:03.406
I'll take a different route
to the main road.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.116
It's safer.

54:07.869 --> 54:10.288
I don't know much about God,

54:10.372 --> 54:11.706
and I don't even care.

54:13.041 --> 54:14.542
One thing I know for sure

54:14.626 --> 54:16.711
is that this world belongs to us.

54:18.129 --> 54:20.799
We should settle our own affairs.

54:21.841 --> 54:23.593
Don't you agree, Ms. Min?
