WEBVTT

04:40.802 --> 04:43.457
Timber!

04:52.901 --> 04:54.685
That's a deep hole.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.513
And getting deeper.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.123
Why are you digging it?

04:58.123 --> 04:59.473
We're building a house.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.257
Down there?

05:51.089 --> 05:52.787
I don't know, Richard.

05:52.787 --> 05:56.007
That back porch window just
doesn't want to stay closed.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.967
Even had my husband
sand down where it's warped.

05:58.967 --> 06:01.665
Even though
nobody seems to care,

06:01.665 --> 06:03.972
a million dollars
is a steal these days.

06:03.972 --> 06:05.800
- Hmm.
- Here are the keys.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.019
Please remember to
put them in the lockbox

06:08.019 --> 06:09.630
- when you're finished.
- Look, we won't be long.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.022
Twenty, 30 minutes, tops.

06:11.022 --> 06:12.284
And thank you
for arranging this.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.460
It means a lot.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.810
My pleasure, Richard.

07:01.812 --> 07:05.860
You truly
won't find a more perfect house.

07:05.860 --> 07:10.604
There's a full basement where we
have an ultramodern central
heating furnace

07:10.604 --> 07:13.476
with copper
pipes, an oil burner.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.086
No more of that coal stoking.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.481
Uh, it's only been
on the market 18 days.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.135
It won't last long.

07:20.135 --> 07:23.138
The house was originally built
in 1900, Mr. and Mrs. Young.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.531
A half colonial.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.621
It is as sturdy as an old tree.

07:27.621 --> 07:29.623
So, as you can
see, Mr. and Mrs. Young--

07:29.623 --> 07:31.320
Al and Rose is fine!

07:31.320 --> 07:33.278
Al lost the hearing
in his left ear

07:33.278 --> 07:35.237
when a shell exploded
right next to him.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.847
The doctors say
it will eventually clear up.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.240
Oh, that's fortunate.

07:38.240 --> 07:40.111
He also has bomb fragments
lodged in his hip.

07:40.111 --> 07:42.462
He'll have to carry that around
for the rest of his life.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.072
My husband went missing at sea.

07:44.072 --> 07:46.770
- Oh.
- At Midway.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.469
Three years in June now.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.471
I've heard of people
having the doorbell ring

07:51.471 --> 07:53.473
and their husband
is standing right there.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.083
Al was in the
Battle of Saint-Lô.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.215
Eleven thousand
casualties in two weeks.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.522
For crying out loud, Rose,
what does any of this

07:59.522 --> 08:01.698
have to do with
the price of tea in China?

08:01.698 --> 08:02.960
China!

08:05.223 --> 08:08.096
The house
is 1,800 square feet

08:08.096 --> 08:10.794
with enough lot
to add on if you grow.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.101
There's a dining room.

08:13.101 --> 08:15.930
Yeah, custom kitchen cabinets,
a breakfast nook,

08:15.930 --> 08:17.540
a lovely back porch,

08:17.540 --> 08:20.412
which can always be converted
into a spare guest room.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.545
Upstairs-- four large bedrooms,

08:22.545 --> 08:24.416
bathrooms, one with a shower,

08:24.416 --> 08:27.942
a powder room and large closets.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.379
The kitchen appliances
come with the house.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.555
A four-burner Norge range,

08:32.555 --> 08:35.036
complete with a built-in
electric clock and timer.

08:35.036 --> 08:37.081
I don't like it much at all.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.170
It's like a shoebox.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.521
I can't imagine
anyone living here.

08:42.652 --> 08:46.134
Not much of a view
for what you're asking.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.831
If I may.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.442
Of all my listings,
this property is by far

08:50.442 --> 08:52.270
the closest to
the new grade school.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.621
And it's less than a mile
from the new aerodrome

08:54.621 --> 08:56.231
they're going to build.

08:56.231 --> 08:59.103
Could come in
handy in the future.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.975
- The future?
- That's right, Pauline.

09:00.975 --> 09:03.368
It's the only
direction we're headed.

09:03.368 --> 09:07.198
And it's happening
right now, right here.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.418
John, is living near
an aerodrome

09:09.418 --> 09:10.898
really that important to you?

09:10.898 --> 09:13.509
It is, Pauline. It truly is.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.163
It's the future.

09:17.165 --> 09:20.647
Well, I guess I'll get
used to that monstrosity

09:20.647 --> 09:22.953
- across the street.
- Darling, you are a peach.

09:22.953 --> 09:25.347
You're an absolute peach.

09:45.846 --> 09:50.111
So, they're asking 3,400.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.986
That's a very good price.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.336
I have two more couples
who are coming just today.

09:58.336 --> 10:00.469
One is a colonel, I understand.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.210
Married an Italian woman.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.081
She doesn't speak a word
of English.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.909
Has a lovely smile.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.609
Why don't I give you a moment
to talk it over?

10:11.001 --> 10:14.135
Three thousand, four hundred?
Gee whillikers, Rose, no.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.919
We agreed we couldn't pay more
than 3,000,

10:15.919 --> 10:17.617
even with my dad's money.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.880
I'm pregnant.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.403
You're what?

10:21.403 --> 10:23.100
I'm pregnant!

10:23.100 --> 10:24.319
- You are?
- Yes.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.582
- Really?
- Three months.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.675
Any thoughts?

10:32.675 --> 10:35.547
The price is right in line
with the G.I. Bill guarantee.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.201
- We'll take it.
-  Yes!

10:37.201 --> 10:38.333
We'll take it! Yes, we will.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.206
Ricky, it's your first
Christmas.

10:42.206 --> 10:45.557
- Yes! Get you here.
-  Okay.

10:45.557 --> 10:46.907
Oh, look at him.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.952
He's such a perfect angel.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.737
-  Ricky, smile.
-  Oh, Ricky...

10:50.737 --> 10:53.870
Ready and... smile.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.829
Okay, calm down, Ricky.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.961
Ricky? Ricky, sit down.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.615
Sit. Over here.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.182
- Ricky. Ricky.
-  Yes.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.792
Okay, we get it. You can jump.

11:02.792 --> 11:04.576
- Ricky. Quit jumping.
-  Ricky, sit down, honey.

11:04.576 --> 11:06.143
Sit down next to your--

11:06.143 --> 11:08.102
- Sit down next to your sister.
- We're gonna take a picture.

11:08.102 --> 11:09.712
- It's all right. Sit down.
- Ricky! Ricky, sit down!

11:09.712 --> 11:12.106
- Smile. Smile.
- Goddamn it, Ricky, sit down!

11:12.106 --> 11:13.803
Oh, my God!

11:13.803 --> 11:16.632
Okay, Ricky Ricardo,
time to give it a rest.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.634
Yeah, that-- It's...

11:18.634 --> 11:21.332
really loud for Daddy's head.

11:21.332 --> 11:23.334
- Ricky, listen to me.
-  Look, Jimmy, look.

11:23.334 --> 11:25.336
Rick-- Ricky!

11:25.336 --> 11:27.077
Ricky, stop it, goddamn it!

11:27.077 --> 11:28.818
Look, Jimmy, look!

11:28.818 --> 11:31.952
Yeah, and I think Santa's lost
his goddamn mind.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.128
Those drums are
from your mother.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.696
Well, they're
going in the garage.

11:39.263 --> 11:41.744
Jimmy, Elizabeth,
I'm warning you two.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.877
Get ready for bed, please.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.879
Elizabeth, take
your brother upstairs.

11:45.879 --> 11:47.141
Now.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.708
- Thank you.
-  Come on.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.753
I met the couple who moved
into the new house, honey.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.102
Oh, honey,
don't close the drapes.

11:52.102 --> 11:54.931
I hate it. It looks
like a funeral parlor.

11:57.542 --> 11:58.935
Ted and Virginia.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.545
Yeah? What are they like?

12:00.545 --> 12:02.373
Well, she's gonna have a baby.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.898
- What are they like?
- Um...

12:04.898 --> 12:06.856
Well, they like to laugh.

12:06.856 --> 12:09.337
They're so, I don't know,
filled with life.

12:09.337 --> 12:10.555
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:10.555 --> 12:11.861
How long they been married?

12:11.861 --> 12:13.297
Stop it.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.299
- Ricky, sweetheart, 20 minutes.
- I'm just playing.

12:15.299 --> 12:17.345
That's it, all right?
And put this stuff away.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.392
Elizabeth! Jimmy!

12:23.481 --> 12:25.788
That's a hell of a battle
you got going there.

12:25.788 --> 12:27.311
Who's winning?

12:27.311 --> 12:29.661
The Americans just
shot all the Krauts.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.967
Good.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.317
Did you ever shoot anybody?

12:33.317 --> 12:34.797
Come again?

12:34.797 --> 12:37.539
In the war--
did you shoot anybody?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.673
It's hard to know.

12:42.979 --> 12:45.590
Everything happens so fast,
it's just a blur.

12:45.590 --> 12:49.943
You never really see the enemy,
just the flash of a helmet.

12:51.727 --> 12:56.514
Guy next to me, Carl Bolton,
from Wesley, Ohio...

12:56.514 --> 12:58.821
he had two
different color eyes-- one...

12:58.821 --> 13:00.692
one brown, one blue.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.259
Two-tone.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.045
Called him Two-tone.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.353
Saw him get his jaw blown off.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.443
What did you do?

13:13.836 --> 13:16.056
What? Do?

13:16.056 --> 13:19.320
After that guy got his
jaw shot off, what'd you do?

13:23.977 --> 13:26.196
I don't want to talk about it.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.772
They should
arrive within a fortnight.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.427
And to be
perfectly honest, I dread it.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.647
Oh, William, your own father,
your own son.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.040
- Please.
- I-I know.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.738
I'm just nervous
to see little Billy.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.610
He's 13 now.

15:15.610 --> 15:17.568
It's been years
since we were last together.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.267
You know, he might as well
be my father's son.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.051
Your father is
certainly a presence,

15:22.051 --> 15:25.228
but you are an important man
in your own right.

15:25.228 --> 15:27.535
My father thinks
he can overthrow the Crown.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.537
And this treasonous rabble
that follows him

15:29.537 --> 15:32.496
has no idea what a crackpot
the old man is!

15:32.496 --> 15:35.151
Flying a kite,
naked but for his nightgown,

15:35.151 --> 15:37.980
in the middle
of a lightning storm, no less.

15:37.980 --> 15:41.723
Promise me that you will not
discuss politics with
your father.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.378
I so dislike arguments.

15:44.378 --> 15:48.338
Well, I'm afraid my father and I
are on entirely different
sides now.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.645
Breaks my heart
to read his letters.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.777
My own father is
becoming a terrorist.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.128
You redcoat bastard!

15:55.128 --> 15:57.173
What in the--

15:57.173 --> 15:59.001
-  I took his hat off!
- The indignity!

15:59.001 --> 16:00.568
You ruffians!

16:00.568 --> 16:02.396
You ought to be
put in the stocks!

16:02.396 --> 16:05.007
You filthy rebel scoundrels!

16:05.007 --> 16:06.966
- Oh, my.
- Oh, oh, Elizabeth.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.359
Oh, what is
this world coming to?

16:09.359 --> 16:11.405
I wonder how old it is.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.146
It's over 200 years old.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.365
Some famous
colonial guy lived there.

16:15.365 --> 16:17.193
Really? Who told you that?

16:17.193 --> 16:19.979
- Dave, our next-door neighbor.
- Dave?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.719
Yeah, the one
with the perfect lawn.

16:21.719 --> 16:23.286
Little welcome gift from Dave.

16:23.286 --> 16:24.679
Oh, how nice.

16:24.679 --> 16:25.810
Have you seen Justin?

16:25.810 --> 16:27.203
I need help with
these heavy boxes.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.379
Yeah, he's out back. Justin!

16:29.379 --> 16:30.946
Come help your
mother with these boxes.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.340
Hold on, you
packed that ratty thing?

16:33.340 --> 16:34.819
Of course I did.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.952
- Buck's a family heirloom.
- Uh-huh.

16:36.952 --> 16:39.650
Well, you can hang that
ugly heirloom in the garage.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.957
She called you ugly, Buck.

16:41.957 --> 16:45.787
You know what is ugly,
is these damn walls.

16:45.787 --> 16:48.224
What'd they do,
paint it with vomit?

16:48.224 --> 16:49.747
You're so romantic.

16:49.747 --> 16:52.576
- Isn't he romantic, Raquel?
-  He sure is.

Susie off her chair?

17:11.987 --> 17:13.815

- No, you're not.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.338
You have to play nicely.

smooth action on this
damn footrest.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.410
Oh, you'll figure it out, honey.

17:43.410 --> 17:44.933
You always do.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.239
Here's your lunch.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.675
Thanks, doll.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.898
Huh.

17:53.898 --> 17:56.727
Every day, the mailman comes,

17:56.727 --> 17:59.643
the dog barks,
the mailman goes away.

17:59.643 --> 18:03.212
The dog thinks he has protected
us once again from an intruder.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.909
It's a symbiotic relationship.

18:04.909 --> 18:06.694
- It's a little ritual they do.
- Aw.

18:06.694 --> 18:09.305
- A little performance.
- A little like us.

18:09.305 --> 18:11.133
Oh, how do you mean?

18:11.133 --> 18:14.571
I mean I make you a Spam
sandwich and you sit in your
Relaxer chair.

18:14.571 --> 18:15.920
Exactly.

18:15.920 --> 18:20.882
Only now, I'm calling it
my Relax-E-Boy chair.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.144
- Oh.
- Mm.

18:22.144 --> 18:24.190
Isn't Relaxer
chair too on the nose?

18:24.190 --> 18:25.800
- Mm...
- I feel like,

18:25.800 --> 18:30.457
by calling it a boy, it gives
it a fun, youthful feel.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.502
God knows we got to appeal
to that youth market.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.548
Relax-E-Boy. I like that.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.159
You are so clever.

18:37.159 --> 18:40.510
Relax-E-Boy. Relax-E-Boy.

18:41.555 --> 18:43.818
Relax-E-Boy chair.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.776
Relax.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.083
Relax-E-Boy.

18:48.083 --> 18:50.912
What you need is
a Relax-E-Boy chair.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.481
The milk's here.

18:54.481 --> 18:57.832
For some reason, he always
leaves it at the bottom of
the steps.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.443
And his horse
shits right next to it.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.188
What do you think?

19:06.188 --> 19:09.583
Just shipped in from London--
Alfred Dunhill.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.585
- What time will you be home?
- Oh, let me see.

19:11.585 --> 19:14.805
Uh, 450-mile
round trip to Schenectady

19:14.805 --> 19:19.332
at 110 miles per hour,
plus two fuel stops.

19:19.332 --> 19:22.248
I'll be home before
you can say "Schenectady."

19:22.248 --> 19:24.598
- Good Lord.
- The sky's the limit, Pauline.

19:24.598 --> 19:28.950
John, you mortgaged our house
to buy that ridiculous airplane.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.256
Our home.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.432
Just come up with me
for a ride-- one ride.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.695
- You'll love it. Trust me.
- Not on your life.

19:34.695 --> 19:37.524
I tremble every time
you get in that contraption.

19:37.524 --> 19:40.483
Every week, I read in the news
that an airplane has crashed.

19:40.483 --> 19:43.094
You know why?
Poor fuel management.

19:43.094 --> 19:46.097
Most planes crash
because they run out of gas.

19:46.097 --> 19:49.100
Fuel management is
the key to safe flying.

19:49.100 --> 19:50.624
And regular engine maintenance.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.279
Proper fuel management
and regular engine maintenance

19:53.279 --> 19:55.542
are the keys to safe flying.

19:55.542 --> 19:56.978
And the weather.

19:56.978 --> 19:59.502
Proper fuel management,
regular engine maintenance

19:59.502 --> 20:01.852
and staying out
of thunderstorms.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.290
That's all it takes.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.423
Aviation is the future, Pauline.

20:07.423 --> 20:09.425
Your head is in
the clouds, John.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.122
I knew you were
going to say that.

20:11.122 --> 20:13.255
How do you
know what I was gonna say?

20:13.255 --> 20:16.127
Well, I'm done with
this bullshit conversation.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.565
Christ almighty,
what is the world coming to?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.131
What was that all about?

20:20.131 --> 20:23.178
Goddamn Bill, he calls me
long-distance from Pittsburgh

20:23.178 --> 20:25.093
to brag about all
the sales he's made.

20:25.093 --> 20:26.312
It's late, Al.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.661
- We should go to bed.
- Goddamn Pittsburgh.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.489
How come he's at
the trade show, huh?

20:29.489 --> 20:31.752
No, really, I-I've been
at the company longer.

20:31.752 --> 20:33.449
I've been--
I've been passed over, Rose.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.146
I've been passed over.

20:36.844 --> 20:39.107
No, he's right. He's right.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.718
I never succeeded in anything
unless you count

20:41.718 --> 20:44.286
staying alive in the war,
and then I just got lucky.

20:44.286 --> 20:47.115
Oh, we both got lucky
that we found one another.

20:47.115 --> 20:49.335
Ricky, don't forget
to turn out the lights.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.424
Al, it's so late.
Let's go to bed.

20:51.424 --> 20:53.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah. In a minute.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.780
What are you always drawing?

20:59.780 --> 21:02.086
- Whatever I see.
- Let me see.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.049
Well, what do you know?
The living room.

21:08.049 --> 21:10.312
That'll bring a pretty penny.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.621
Goddamn Bill.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.406
Hey, how-how many towns
can you name in Pennsylvania,

21:17.406 --> 21:19.321
besides Pittsburgh?

21:19.321 --> 21:21.018
Uh, not too many.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.716
Philadelphia.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.587
I don't know. Allen-something.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.154
"Allen-something."

21:26.154 --> 21:28.504
- Allentown.
- Mm.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.985
Hard to remember.

21:30.985 --> 21:33.204
I could tell you every town
along the turnpike.

21:33.204 --> 21:37.600
Grove City,
Clarion, DuBois, Bellefonte...

21:37.600 --> 21:39.950
Lock Haven.

21:39.950 --> 21:42.605
Each one has a hotel,
and if you know your way around,

21:42.605 --> 21:45.478
you can get a room
that looks out at the river.

21:45.478 --> 21:47.567
You hear it going all night.

21:47.567 --> 21:50.700
Nothing like sleeping
to the sound of a river.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.355
And then you got diners
with food so good, boy,

21:53.355 --> 21:55.705
you can't imagine.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.579
Places to drink that
make you feel right at home.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.627
I've been to places.

22:06.412 --> 22:08.501
I've been to places.

22:11.155 --> 22:14.245
One night, I took somebody
back to my room.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.248
She had red hair.

22:17.248 --> 22:18.989
Al, are you
coming to bed?

22:18.989 --> 22:21.165
Yeah.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.254
Why are you telling me all this?

22:28.347 --> 22:30.131
It's just one night.

23:16.220 --> 23:18.484
They let me go.

23:18.484 --> 23:20.660
What do you mean
they let you go?

23:20.660 --> 23:23.010
They let me go. They...

23:23.010 --> 23:26.579
said there weren't enough
opportunities for salesmen of
that product anymore,

23:26.579 --> 23:29.320
and I don't know,
and they're shrinking.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.541
They gave Bill Pennsylvania.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.849
What are they talking about?
"Opportunities."

23:35.849 --> 23:38.765
Didn't I always sell
for them, Rose? Didn't I?

23:40.288 --> 23:43.073
We'll have to take a new
mortgage out on the house
somehow.

23:43.073 --> 23:44.684
The roof will have to wait.

23:45.989 --> 23:48.992
They...
they shrunk me, Rose.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.690
They shrunk me.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.256
What am I gonna do now, Rose?

23:52.256 --> 23:54.171
What am I gonna do?

23:55.912 --> 23:58.524
We'll figure it out.

23:58.524 --> 24:00.482
We always do.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.356
Hey, everybody,
I want you to meet someone.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.228
Elizabeth, Jimmy,
say hello to Margaret.

24:07.228 --> 24:08.708
-  Hi, guys.
- Hi, Margaret.

24:10.318 --> 24:12.102
Whoopee cushion. What a jerk.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.495
Hey, Dad?

24:13.495 --> 24:15.279
I'd like you to meet Margaret.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.672
Nice to meet you, Margaret.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.761
Nice to meet you, Mr. Young.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.763
Uh, Richard told me
that you fought in the war.

24:20.763 --> 24:23.070
- My-my father was a pilot.
- Ah.

24:23.070 --> 24:24.985
Yeah, yeah, in '59,
he tried out to be a...

24:24.985 --> 24:26.290
a-an astronaut with NASA.

24:26.290 --> 24:27.683
Well, his eyes
weren't good enough.

24:27.683 --> 24:29.555
- But he almost made it, right?
- Yeah, he did.

24:29.555 --> 24:34.385
But he-he manages a chain
of auto parts stores now.

24:35.604 --> 24:39.521
And he always says,
"Oh, what could have been?"

24:39.521 --> 24:43.133
Well, there is a lot
of that going around.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.744
"Well,
there's a lot of that going--"

24:44.744 --> 24:46.833
Mom, I want you
to meet Margaret.

24:46.833 --> 24:48.965
I'm just taking out
the roast, honey. Who?

24:48.965 --> 24:50.532
- Margaret.
- I'll go in.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.099
Hi, Mrs. Young.

24:52.099 --> 24:54.362
Can I help you with anything?

24:54.362 --> 24:56.451
Pleasure
to meet you, Margaret.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.540
So, do you go to Franklin High?

24:58.540 --> 25:00.368
No,
I go to St. Paul's.

25:00.368 --> 25:02.065
Oh.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.111
St. Paul's.
Well, how did you meet Richard?

25:04.111 --> 25:06.461
Hey, did you see
the zesty carrots?

25:06.461 --> 25:09.943
What do you plan to do
after high school, Margaret?

25:09.943 --> 25:12.641
I'd like to go to college.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.556
Maybe someday be a lawyer.

25:14.556 --> 25:17.124
- A lawyer?
- She'd make a good lawyer.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.604
She's very persuasive.

25:18.604 --> 25:20.910
What's wrong with being a wife?

25:23.130 --> 25:26.089
If you decide to do
something, don't wait.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.048
I had wanted to be a bookkeeper.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.659
You should
see her checkbook.

25:33.401 --> 25:36.665
Well, I'm going
into the graphic arts.

25:36.665 --> 25:38.580
- I'm going to be an artist.
- Oh, great.

25:38.580 --> 25:40.582
Just what the world needs.
Don't be an idiot.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.932
Get a job where you wear a suit.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.241
Time just went.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.032
I would have been
a good bookkeeper.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.532
Ew!

26:17.532 --> 26:18.751
Damn it, Jimmy!

26:18.751 --> 26:20.622
- I see you.
- Kissing!

26:20.622 --> 26:23.059
I am gonna clobber you!

26:24.974 --> 26:26.976
Can you smell something funny?

26:26.976 --> 26:31.546
You know, when you smell
something, you're actually
inhaling molecules

26:31.546 --> 26:35.637
that have detached themselves
from whatever it is you're
smelling

26:35.637 --> 26:38.640
and-and spread
out over a large area.

26:38.640 --> 26:41.600
If we could see a loaf of bread
by its smell,

26:41.600 --> 26:43.819
it would be enormous.

26:45.212 --> 26:47.475
Hey, gorgeous,
get a load of this recline.

26:47.475 --> 26:48.868
I'm late, Raquel.

26:48.868 --> 26:50.870
I probably won't see you again
until Thursday.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.176
Okay, see you Thursday, Ms. H.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.656
Okay, you be good.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.136
Oh, I will.

26:56.136 --> 26:58.007
- Morning, Raquel.
- Ah, morning, Justin.

26:58.007 --> 26:59.922
- You got your lunch?
- Uh-huh.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.055
Anything exciting going on
in school today?

27:02.055 --> 27:03.273
Mm, not really.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.797
Just first day of driver's ed.

27:04.797 --> 27:07.234
Driver's ed? [sighs] <i>Dios mío.</i>

27:07.234 --> 27:09.366
Only yesterday,
I was changing your diapers.

27:09.366 --> 27:11.455
Uh-huh. See you Thursday.

27:11.455 --> 27:13.240
- Wallet.
- Check.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.894
- Watch.
- Check.

27:14.894 --> 27:16.243
Keys?

27:16.243 --> 27:18.898
Check, check and double check.

27:18.898 --> 27:20.726
- You nervous?
- Yeah.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.379
I'm not sure I can
still do this.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.686
You could
sell a teapot a spout.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.470
No one can say no to you.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.255
- You're a charmer.
- Oh? I don't know, Rose.

27:28.255 --> 27:31.824
I'm not a 23-year-old veteran
full of piss and vinegar
anymore.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.653
Just watch your drinking.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.872
Jesus Christ.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.317
<i>Oh,
my goodness, Mommy.</i>

27:47.317 --> 27:48.710
<i>It was so exciting.</i>

27:48.710 --> 27:51.191
<i>You can see everything
just like a bird does.</i>

27:51.191 --> 27:53.846
<i>And it makes your tummy tickle
and get all squiggly.</i>

27:53.846 --> 27:56.805
<i>And you're taller
than the tallest tree.</i>

27:56.805 --> 27:59.678
<i>And everybody looks so small,
like they're ants.</i>

27:59.678 --> 28:03.290
<i>And all the houses
and carriages look like toys.</i>

28:03.290 --> 28:06.206
We weren't expecting you home
until this evening.

28:06.206 --> 28:09.426
How is the suffering
for suffrage going?

28:09.426 --> 28:11.733
The windows couldn't open,
so we postponed it

28:11.733 --> 28:14.910
until we could find a room
with better ventilation.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.738
Sweetheart,
will you please go to your room

28:16.738 --> 28:18.000
and practice for a while?

28:18.000 --> 28:19.436
I need to speak to your father.

28:19.436 --> 28:21.569
When you finish, can I tell you
about the landing?

28:21.569 --> 28:22.831
Of course, dear.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.920
I'll come get you.

28:27.923 --> 28:29.751
I can't believe
you took our precious child

28:29.751 --> 28:31.057
up in that death trap.

28:31.057 --> 28:32.798
Calm down, Pauline.
You're overreacting.

28:32.798 --> 28:36.497
Overreacting? My God, John,
she's the only child we have.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.934
Look, I simply wanted her
to experience something

28:38.934 --> 28:41.110
that very few people,
let alone children, have--

28:41.110 --> 28:43.722
Oh, please.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.507
I'm sorry. I should have
told you ahead of time.

28:46.507 --> 28:49.075
You know perfectly well I would
never have allowed it. Never.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.641
Okay, you're right.

28:50.641 --> 28:52.556
You're right.

28:52.556 --> 28:54.950
Sell that infernal plane, John,

28:54.950 --> 28:56.343

killed in it.

29:13.664 --> 29:17.973

29:30.725 --> 29:33.032
She's pregnant.
Margaret is pregnant.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.426
You're just 18 years old.

29:36.426 --> 29:38.254
The beatnik lawyer,
is she even 18?

29:38.254 --> 29:39.821
What do you want me to say?

29:39.821 --> 29:42.345
God, you stupid prick, you!

29:42.345 --> 29:43.912
You couldn't
keep it in your pants!

29:43.912 --> 29:47.263
We both have stupid pricks, Dad.

29:47.263 --> 29:50.527
Don't be a wiseass.
Do not be a wiseass!

29:50.527 --> 29:53.487
You think I wanted
to end up selling vacuums?

29:53.487 --> 29:56.838
You think I wanted to be done
with my life when I was 22?

29:56.838 --> 29:59.667
You think I didn't have things
I wanted to do?

29:59.667 --> 30:01.060
Dreams?

30:01.060 --> 30:02.539
For you.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.846
Al, what's going on?

30:04.846 --> 30:07.501
You're gonna be a grandmother.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.807
What?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.547
Margaret's pregnant, Mom.

31:35.328 --> 31:36.982
I thought I was
the only one

31:36.982 --> 31:38.374
having a hard time sleeping.

31:38.374 --> 31:39.767
Mm, I'm trying
to get a feel

31:39.767 --> 31:42.204
for the early morning light.

31:45.468 --> 31:47.949
Give me your hand.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.343
- What?
- You feel that?

31:50.343 --> 31:52.127
No-- Oh.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.216
Oh.

31:55.739 --> 31:58.699
He's gonna be
a field goal kicker.

31:58.699 --> 32:02.964
Or she's gonna be
a high-kicking chorus girl.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.750
A dancer.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.491
- I put the coffee on for you.
- Thanks.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.363
Step this way, please, gorgeous.

32:10.363 --> 32:12.321
Take a seat right here.

32:12.321 --> 32:13.932
Oh, why, thank you.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.108
I have something very important
I want to tell you.

32:16.108 --> 32:17.544
Oh, yeah? What's that, lover?

32:17.544 --> 32:19.807
I think '42 is gonna
be a great year.

32:19.807 --> 32:21.287
And why is that?

32:21.287 --> 32:22.723
Oh!

32:22.723 --> 32:25.160
Those boys up in Michigan
seem very interested

32:25.160 --> 32:29.469
in my chair's 180-degree
full recline feature.

32:29.469 --> 32:31.036
I think they're gonna go for it.

32:31.036 --> 32:32.689
I think you're right.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.909
You're my genius inventor.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.171
And you know what else?

32:36.171 --> 32:37.781
With this full recline feature,

32:37.781 --> 32:40.001
you never even have to leave
the chair.

32:40.001 --> 32:42.482
You can even sleep right here.

32:42.482 --> 32:45.311
Right here in
our Relax-E-Boy chair.

32:45.311 --> 32:48.009
You know what else you can do
with a full recline feature?

32:48.009 --> 32:50.098
In the middle of
a Sunday afternoon?

32:50.098 --> 32:52.535
What would Father Murphy say?

32:52.535 --> 32:55.016
Well,
let's not tell him.

33:01.196 --> 33:03.024
<i>This is John Daly speaking</i>

33:03.024 --> 33:04.895
<i>from the CBS
newsroom in New York.</i>

33:04.895 --> 33:07.768
<i>Here is the Far East situation

33:07.768 --> 33:09.900
<i>The Japanese have attacked

<i>capital of the Philippines...</i>

33:20.215 --> 33:22.391
I just can't get comfortable.

33:22.391 --> 33:25.046
Oh. I'm sorry. I know it's late.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.657
I was just trying to catch
the rising moon.

33:33.272 --> 33:34.621
Sleeping Beauty over here

33:34.621 --> 33:37.058
doesn't have a problem
getting comfortable.

33:39.974 --> 33:42.629
Honey, wait.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.239
Can you turn towards the light?

33:44.239 --> 33:47.068
Oh, I just don't feel pretty
right now, Richard.

33:47.068 --> 33:49.114
Honey, you don't
understand. I...

33:50.376 --> 33:53.161
I can't take my eyes off of you.

34:04.346 --> 34:06.218
Oh, no.

34:06.218 --> 34:07.915
Al!

34:07.915 --> 34:09.221
Goddamn rain!

34:10.657 --> 34:12.093
It's coming through the walls!

34:12.093 --> 34:13.877
You have the-the number
of the, uh...

34:13.877 --> 34:15.140
the-the roofing guy?

34:15.140 --> 34:16.576
What roofing guy?

34:16.576 --> 34:18.143
The-- José,
the Puerto Rican.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.145
No,
José's the gutter guy!

34:20.145 --> 34:21.798
He-he's a gutter guy?

34:21.798 --> 34:23.191
We have a gutter guy?

34:23.191 --> 34:25.541
Yeah, José,
he cleans the rain gutters.

34:25.541 --> 34:26.977
Oh...

34:26.977 --> 34:29.067
God, Al, did you
move that bucket?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.459
Yeah, I moved the bucket!

34:30.459 --> 34:32.809
- I had to look at the hole!
- Look at the floor!

34:32.809 --> 34:34.463
Look at all that water!

34:36.291 --> 34:39.077
Jimmy, the baby's coming.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.948
- Now?
- Right now!

34:40.948 --> 34:42.863
- Call a taxi.
- A taxi?

34:42.863 --> 34:44.430
I have to get to the hospital!

34:44.430 --> 34:46.736
Oh! Oh!
Jimmy, it's not waiting.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.738
What do you mean it's not
waiting? It has to wait!

34:48.738 --> 34:50.175
Oh, my God,
you have to do something!

34:50.175 --> 34:51.437
- Jimmy!
- Jesus Christ!

34:51.437 --> 34:53.003
Call a taxi!

34:55.658 --> 34:57.573
Breathe. Okay, Lamaze. Lamaze.

34:57.573 --> 34:59.967
- I got towels.
- Oh, my God. What?

34:59.967 --> 35:03.144
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

35:03.144 --> 35:04.972
- Are you calling a taxi?
- No.

35:04.972 --> 35:06.626
Who are you calling?

35:06.626 --> 35:08.584
- The fire department.
- The fire department?!

35:12.675 --> 35:14.460
How do you like
them apples, kid?

35:14.460 --> 35:16.070
A ringside seat.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.551
A circle of life.

35:18.551 --> 35:19.987
You did good, kid.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.728
It's a girl.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.175
<i>That is the moon.</i>

35:34.175 --> 35:36.177
That is the moon.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.527
And look, look, look.

35:38.527 --> 35:41.008
There's another moon.

35:41.008 --> 35:42.618
That's another moon.
That's right.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.620
So we have two. We have two.

35:44.620 --> 35:49.190
There's one moon,
and there's the other moon.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.158
<i>You're
the most beautiful angel.</i>

36:00.158 --> 36:01.507
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

36:01.507 --> 36:03.248
<i> Yes.</i>

36:03.248 --> 36:05.163
You're the most beautiful girl.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.991
Oh, what is that goofy face?

36:07.991 --> 36:10.733
Yeah.

36:10.733 --> 36:13.606
You make Mommy so happy.

36:13.606 --> 36:16.304
I'm so happy. Yeah.

36:16.304 --> 36:18.306
You want to go
get something to eat?

36:18.306 --> 36:21.004
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

36:21.004 --> 36:23.485
Applesauce? You want applesauce?

36:29.535 --> 36:31.319
I know.

36:31.319 --> 36:33.365
Oh, are you sleepy?

36:33.365 --> 36:35.802
You need to take
a little nap-nap?

36:35.802 --> 36:38.152
I think it's time to go
night night, right?

36:38.152 --> 36:40.241
You gonna take a little nap?

36:40.241 --> 36:41.547
Yeah.

36:41.547 --> 36:44.637
We sing a little lullaby,
and we go night night.

36:44.637 --> 36:46.595
Time to go night night.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.492
Vanessa, look who's here.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.581
Daddy's home.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.366
Hi. What-what are you doing?

37:18.366 --> 37:19.759
I got the job.

37:19.759 --> 37:21.456
What?

37:21.456 --> 37:24.067
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Congratulations.

37:24.067 --> 37:27.114
They hired
me on the spot.

37:27.114 --> 37:29.290
You girls are looking
at the newest salesman

37:29.290 --> 37:33.381
of the 12th-largest life
insurance company in America.

37:33.381 --> 37:35.122
That is so great, Richard.

37:35.122 --> 37:38.081
Yeah, it's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.822
Aren't you happy?

37:40.823 --> 37:42.869
I'm sorry.

37:42.869 --> 37:44.914
We've done everything we can.

37:51.834 --> 37:54.533
-  Okay. Roll it.
- Everybody ready?

37:54.533 --> 37:56.317
Is that working? Yeah.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.536
Hey.

37:57.536 --> 37:59.015
Stop it, Jimmy.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.800
- Jimmy, do not mess with that.
- Oh, three stockings?

38:00.800 --> 38:02.845
We need a fourth
for Vanessa. Yeah.

38:02.845 --> 38:04.456
Oh, my God,
the middle one was mine.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.935
I love Christmas.

38:05.935 --> 38:08.286
That was the year
we got our own tree.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.722
- Wow.
- Yeah, it cost me

38:09.722 --> 38:11.724
a damn fortune,
and I almost cut my hand off.

38:11.724 --> 38:13.421
- You're so dramatic.
- Yeah, that was quite a day.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.293
Yeah, you got a plastic...
you got a plastic tree, Ted?

38:15.293 --> 38:16.337
Yeah, plastic.

38:16.337 --> 38:17.643
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, there she is.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.166
What did you do to my hair?

38:19.166 --> 38:21.473
Oh, it was so cute, Elizabeth.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.779
That was me. That was me.

38:23.779 --> 38:26.260
I think it's, like,
pom-poms or something.

38:26.260 --> 38:27.827
Look, little Ricky.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.742
Thinks he's the next Ringo.

38:29.742 --> 38:31.309
Nightmare.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.223
- Let there be drums.
- I'm getting flashbacks.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.835
Hey, Rich, you always had an
interest in music, didn't you?

38:35.835 --> 38:38.272
Me? No, no. That wasn't me, Ted.

38:38.272 --> 38:39.752
Sure, you did. I-I remember.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.231
You played in the combo.

38:41.231 --> 38:43.233
You were even thinking
of applying to a music school.

38:43.233 --> 38:45.410
Music school? No, no, not me.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.933
No, no. It was the art academy.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.979
Richard was gonna apply
to the Institute of Arts.

38:49.979 --> 38:51.677
Yeah, well, you know.

38:51.677 --> 38:55.376
We all were sure
you were gonna be somebody.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.683
Yeah, it just didn't work out.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.995
All right.
That's it, baby.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.607
- Now say, "Money!"
- Money!

39:08.607 --> 39:11.697
- Say, "More money!"
- More money!

39:15.527 --> 39:17.137
Wow.

39:17.137 --> 39:18.530
Now, and have you heard

39:18.530 --> 39:20.183
of this new thing
called television?

39:20.183 --> 39:21.750
Is that the radio with pictures?

39:21.750 --> 39:25.188
Yes, and-and we're watching
its development very closely.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.886
Well, so to speak.

39:26.886 --> 39:30.933
A-And we feel a chair like this
might be the perfect complement

39:30.933 --> 39:33.501
to a home television ensemble.

39:35.068 --> 39:36.896
I have to hand it to you, Leo.

39:36.896 --> 39:39.246
This ottoman
feature is really special.

39:39.246 --> 39:40.856
Well, I-I'm glad
you appreciate it.

39:40.856 --> 39:42.902
I-I've been developing it
for quite some time.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.425
-  Mm-hmm.
- A-And you know what else

39:44.425 --> 39:45.992
is pretty special?

39:45.992 --> 39:47.254
- This highball.
-  Oh.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.518
What's your secret,
Mrs. Beekman?

39:50.518 --> 39:52.520
Oh, well, goodness.
Nothing special.

39:52.520 --> 39:55.001
Just a Seagram's
7 and ginger ale.

39:55.001 --> 39:57.133
- And a little squeeze of lemon.
- Oh.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.831
And the ginger ale
is Canada Dry.

39:58.831 --> 39:59.962
Oh, yeah, Canada Dry.

39:59.962 --> 40:01.007
- Just the good stuff.
- Uh-huh.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.009
- Yeah, well, it's delicious.
- Oh.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.099
But I'd like to get to know
a little more about you two.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.188
- How did you meet?
- How did we meet?

40:08.188 --> 40:10.320
Yeah. How did you meet?

40:12.279 --> 40:13.759
Do you want to tell it?

40:13.759 --> 40:15.456
He followed me home.

40:15.456 --> 40:17.023
- Followed you home?
- Mm-hmm.

40:17.023 --> 40:20.026
I used to see her run
by the window where I worked.

40:20.026 --> 40:22.463
- She was always running.
- I was always late.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.683
So one day, I followed her
and saw where she lived.

40:24.683 --> 40:25.945
And the rest is history.

40:25.945 --> 40:27.642
Inspirational.

40:27.642 --> 40:28.991
I know.

40:28.991 --> 40:31.994
Sometimes our life
is just like a fairy tale.

40:33.692 --> 40:35.345
Oh, I'm not
talking about your life.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.869
I'm talking about
the swivel feature.

40:36.869 --> 40:38.131
Oh.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.263
Absolutely inspired.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.265
Well, that, too.

40:42.265 --> 40:43.658
<i>...feel
so good tonight.</i>

40:43.658 --> 40:45.704
<i>I do. I woke up at 5:00
this morning,</i>

40:45.704 --> 40:47.793
<i>trembling and shaking all over.</i>

40:47.793 --> 40:50.099
<i>I fell asleep with my electric
toothbrush in my mouth.</i>

40:50.099 --> 40:51.449
<i>That's why.</i>

40:51.449 --> 40:52.972
<i>And another reason
I don't feel good...</i>

40:52.972 --> 40:54.452
Boo!

40:58.064 --> 41:00.414
I see a ghost. I see a ghost.

41:00.414 --> 41:01.981
Is that a ghost?
That is a ghost.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.722
I can't believe this house
has a...

41:03.722 --> 41:05.027
...a gh-gh-gh-ghost!

41:05.027 --> 41:06.899
It's a gh-gh-gh-gh-ghost!

41:06.899 --> 41:08.117
Don't chase me, ghost!

41:08.117 --> 41:09.423
Help me!

41:09.423 --> 41:12.295
Help! I'm being followed
by a gh-gh-gh-gh-ghost!

41:12.295 --> 41:14.210
Aah! Mommy! Mommy!

41:14.210 --> 41:16.299
- Mama. Ma. Look, Mother.
- What?

41:16.299 --> 41:17.823
- This house is haunted, Mama.
- Oh, my goodness!

41:17.823 --> 41:19.085
There's a ghost in this house.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.303
Th-There's a ghost.

41:20.303 --> 41:21.391
- Oh, see? Oh. There.
- No! No!

41:21.391 --> 41:22.784
- Do you see it?
- Oh, no! A ghost!

41:22.784 --> 41:24.699
- I see it. I see the ghost!
- No! No! No! No!

41:24.699 --> 41:26.396
Right there! A gh-gh-gh-ghost!

41:27.572 --> 41:29.008
Honey, turn.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.357
- Look at that.
-  Honey.

41:30.357 --> 41:31.880
- Spin, spin, spin.
- Can you smile, sweetheart?

41:31.880 --> 41:33.360
- Focus, honey. Focus, please.
- Yeah, spinning, spinning.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.840
Smile!

41:34.840 --> 41:36.406
Vanessa.

41:36.406 --> 41:37.364
- Smile.
-  Vanessa, face

41:37.364 --> 41:39.105
the camera and sit still!

41:40.933 --> 41:42.891
That young lady is spoiled.

41:42.891 --> 41:44.850
Ready? Smile.

41:48.506 --> 41:50.812
<i>♪ Let it be me...</i>

41:50.812 --> 41:53.685
I'm late.

41:53.685 --> 41:55.208
Is Vanessa in bed already?

41:55.208 --> 41:56.688
Mm, she's out like a light.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.951
Oh, I wanted to see her.

41:59.995 --> 42:02.128
So, how was her
first day of school?

42:02.128 --> 42:04.565
She loved it.
Loves her teacher, too.

42:04.565 --> 42:06.045
Great.

42:07.220 --> 42:09.570
- Richard?
- Yeah?

42:09.570 --> 42:12.138
I think it's time
we had our own house.

42:13.139 --> 42:14.575
Oh, here we go again.

42:14.575 --> 42:15.968
No, our own house.

42:15.968 --> 42:17.578
One that we can
raise Vanessa in.

42:17.578 --> 42:18.884
Our own home.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.668
Honey, we've been through this
a million times.

42:20.668 --> 42:22.757
The mortgage rates
are at nine percent.

42:22.757 --> 42:24.411
And Johnson just put through

42:24.411 --> 42:25.847
the biggest tax hike since
World War II.

42:25.847 --> 42:27.370
We can't swing it right now.

42:27.370 --> 42:29.416
We just... we can't.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.767
- Then I'm getting a new sofa.
- Why?

42:32.767 --> 42:34.290
Because I can't stand looking
at this antique

42:34.290 --> 42:35.422
of your mother's another minute.

42:35.422 --> 42:36.771
- Antique?
- And another thing.

42:36.771 --> 42:38.164
You're gonna have to handle it
with her

42:38.164 --> 42:39.469
because I don't want
to hear about it.

42:39.469 --> 42:40.862
Well, why not just get
a new coffee table

42:40.862 --> 42:41.907
while we're at it?

42:41.907 --> 42:43.038
Thank you.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.823
Now, wait right there.

42:46.694 --> 42:49.218
I believe I'm hearing our song.

42:51.003 --> 42:56.486

And I say to you
with very much glee,

and take a great big pee.

43:44.534 --> 43:47.015
But before you can go to bed,

43:47.015 --> 43:50.149
I want to make quite clear,
no more drinking beer.

43:58.287 --> 43:59.680
You tell 'em, Jimmy.

43:59.680 --> 44:01.900
It's easy to win a one-man race.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.466
En garde, elder brother.

44:03.466 --> 44:05.817
Engage, young James Young.

44:05.817 --> 44:07.645
"Well done is

44:07.645 --> 44:10.386

"He that falls in love with

I must say, the ladies
in my quilting bee

44:15.304 --> 44:17.567
are beginning to speak highly
of your father's ideas.

44:17.567 --> 44:19.178
Oh, Lizzy, that's balderdash.

44:19.178 --> 44:21.571
In a year's time,
no one will remember

44:21.571 --> 44:23.704
the great Benjamin Franklin.

44:23.704 --> 44:27.490
"I enjoy the amours with
mature women for three reasons:

44:27.490 --> 44:29.710

they do not swell,

and they are
grateful as hell."

44:32.626 --> 44:34.367
You win, good sir.

44:34.367 --> 44:36.195
- Way to go, Jimmy!
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

44:36.195 --> 44:37.718
Hear! Hear! Hear!

44:37.718 --> 44:40.939
What fine boots
upon thee, my lady.

44:40.939 --> 44:43.506
"These boots were
made for walkin', baby."

44:43.506 --> 44:45.508
"And that's
just what they'll do."

44:46.988 --> 44:49.425
Ma, let me help you with that.

44:49.425 --> 44:51.993
Pulling out the trusty
table extension, huh?

44:51.993 --> 44:54.692
We expecting a huge
crowd tomorrow?

44:54.692 --> 44:56.955
Oh, just the usual family.

44:56.955 --> 44:59.871
But I invited Ted
and Virg and the kids.

44:59.871 --> 45:01.699
They're Thanksgiving
orphans this year.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.179
The more the merrier, I say, as
long as we have enough turkey.

45:04.179 --> 45:05.746
Well, I got an 18-pounder.

45:05.746 --> 45:07.617
- Should be enough.
- Hope you got enough wine.

45:07.617 --> 45:09.489
You know how Ted
likes to put it away.

45:09.489 --> 45:11.230
You're one to talk.

45:11.230 --> 45:12.492
- Huh?
- Nothing.

45:12.492 --> 45:13.711
What'd you say?

45:13.711 --> 45:15.582
I got something to say.

45:19.412 --> 45:21.240
I enlisted yesterday.

45:21.240 --> 45:22.545
You did what?

45:22.545 --> 45:24.199
I signed up for the Navy.

45:24.199 --> 45:25.635
The Navy?

45:25.635 --> 45:27.812
Christ, Jimmy, what
about college, your deferment?

45:27.812 --> 45:30.162
I was thinking I'd apply to
the fire academy when I get out.

45:30.162 --> 45:31.598
Y-You know, be a firefighter.

45:31.598 --> 45:33.339
Don't you know
there's still a war going on?

45:33.339 --> 45:35.428
A ship just went down
in the South China Sea.

45:35.428 --> 45:37.430
Yeah, well, somebody in this
family has to do their part.

45:37.430 --> 45:39.475
I did my part for all of you.

45:39.475 --> 45:40.825
I don't know what to say.

45:40.825 --> 45:42.565
Well, well,
how about "thank you"?

45:42.565 --> 45:44.219
- "Thank you for your service"?
- Oh, bullshit.

45:44.219 --> 45:45.830
No one ever
thanked me for my service.

45:45.830 --> 45:47.396
Sincerely,
I don't know what to say.

45:47.396 --> 45:49.224
Well, then zip it. Huh?

45:49.224 --> 45:51.879
Last thing I need is a lecture
from my do-nothing brother.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.315
You're such a jerk, Jimmy.

45:53.315 --> 45:54.969
Christ almighty.

45:54.969 --> 45:57.798
Let's not let
this ruin Thanksgiving.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.452
- He'll be fine.
- Yeah.

45:59.452 --> 46:00.932
He'll be fine.

46:00.932 --> 46:02.672
<i>Touchdown!</i>

46:02.672 --> 46:04.762
My little brother
joins the Navy.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.112
I felt so fortunate
to avoid the draft,

46:07.112 --> 46:09.331
and now Jimmy's gonna fight
the Communists?

46:09.331 --> 46:11.638
I weep for America.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.641
I think it's time.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.121
For bed?

46:16.121 --> 46:17.905
- I'm game.
- No.

46:17.905 --> 46:19.777
For us to have
a place of our own

46:19.777 --> 46:22.736
where we can have our
Thanksgiving in our own home.

46:22.736 --> 46:24.216
Well, we've
almost saved up enough.

46:24.216 --> 46:25.565
It won't be long now.

46:25.565 --> 46:28.307
You said that last
Thanksgiving, Richard.

46:28.307 --> 46:29.917
Because I am not going to be

46:29.917 --> 46:31.919
strapped with a mortgage
I can't afford.

46:31.919 --> 46:33.703
Okay, well, I'm getting
a part-time job.

46:33.703 --> 46:35.314
Amy said that there's
an opening for a receptionist

46:35.314 --> 46:36.663
at the law firm she works for.

46:36.663 --> 46:38.578
A part-time job makes no sense.

46:38.578 --> 46:40.406
After taxes, what are
you gonna have to show for it?

46:40.406 --> 46:41.842
Oh, my God,
your obsession with taxes.

46:41.842 --> 46:43.278
- You just don't get it.
- We'll have to hire

46:43.278 --> 46:44.802
a babysitter for Vanessa,
and that's gonna run

46:44.802 --> 46:46.542
- at least $50 a week.
- I need my own space, Richard.

46:46.542 --> 46:47.979
You and me,
we need our own space.

46:47.979 --> 46:49.458
So you want us
to take on more debt?

46:49.458 --> 46:50.851
We haven't paid off
your new furniture yet.

46:50.851 --> 46:52.418
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

46:52.418 --> 46:54.594
We're just gonna live
in this commune until we die?

46:54.594 --> 46:56.465
I have an idea.

46:56.465 --> 46:58.293
Why don't you join the Navy?

46:59.555 --> 47:02.515
Why don't you have
another glass of wine?

47:02.515 --> 47:04.517
Rose, is this leather?

47:04.517 --> 47:05.866
No, it's Naugahyde.

47:05.866 --> 47:07.781
- Naugahyde?
- Margaret bought it.

47:07.781 --> 47:09.304
Mm, seems like it wears well.

47:09.304 --> 47:10.740
It's not really my taste.

47:10.740 --> 47:12.873
It's like something
you would have in an office.

47:12.873 --> 47:14.919
Virginia, can I
get you another drink?

47:14.919 --> 47:17.225
Oh, my, no.

47:17.225 --> 47:19.662
- No, I'm already getting sleepy.
- No?

47:19.662 --> 47:21.708
How about you, Ted?
You look wide awake.

47:21.708 --> 47:24.145
You're not gonna let this good
bourbon go to waste, are you?

47:24.145 --> 47:26.365
Okay, but don't blame me
if you have to carry me home.

47:27.670 --> 47:28.976
Hey, Rose, tell that joke.

47:28.976 --> 47:30.804
- What joke?
- "What joke?" Your joke.

47:30.804 --> 47:32.284
You know, the one
about the doctor.

47:32.284 --> 47:34.025
- Oh, goodness. No, you tell it.
- No, go on.

47:34.025 --> 47:36.027
- You tell it so good.
- No, you tell it.

47:36.027 --> 47:37.463
Come on, Rose, tell us the joke.

47:37.463 --> 47:39.987
Okay, fine. So, there's a guy,

47:39.987 --> 47:42.468
and he calls his doctor
for some test results,

47:42.468 --> 47:44.992
and the doctor says,
"So, Mr. Jones,

47:44.992 --> 47:48.256
I have some good news,
and I have some bad news.

47:48.256 --> 47:51.346
The good news is that
you have 24 hours to live."

47:51.346 --> 47:53.783
"That's the good news?!"
the guy screams.

47:53.783 --> 47:56.177
"What's the bad news?"

47:56.177 --> 47:58.005
"I should've
told you yesterday."

48:01.313 --> 48:03.619
Isn't that great? I didn't--

48:03.619 --> 48:05.230
- It's so silly.
- You tell it so good.

48:05.230 --> 48:06.840
- Doesn't she tell it good?
- I don't think so.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.494
- Ted, are you okay?
- Oh, my.

48:08.494 --> 48:09.930
- You want some water, Ted?
- Hey, Ted.

48:11.497 --> 48:12.802
- Teddy.
- Ted?

48:12.802 --> 48:14.195
Ted?

48:17.677 --> 48:18.939
- Ted!
- Oh, my God!

48:18.939 --> 48:20.114
- Christ almighty!
- Teddy.

48:20.114 --> 48:21.681
- Rose, do something!
- Teddy?

48:21.681 --> 48:23.509
- Wh-What am I supposed to do?
- Call 911!

48:23.509 --> 48:25.511
Get-get a glass
of water or something.

48:25.511 --> 48:27.643
Mouth-to-mouth?

48:27.643 --> 48:28.818
Teddy!

48:32.300 --> 48:34.128
What?

48:34.128 --> 48:36.261
Ted passed away.

48:36.261 --> 48:37.827
He did?

48:39.003 --> 48:40.743
Wh-When?

48:40.743 --> 48:42.528
Twenty minutes ago.

48:44.269 --> 48:46.619
He never woke up.

48:46.619 --> 48:48.969
Well, at least he died laughing.

48:50.101 --> 48:52.930
Why did I have to
tell that stupid joke?

48:54.018 --> 48:55.758
I don't know, Rose.

48:56.977 --> 48:58.239
I don't know.

48:58.239 --> 48:59.849
I guess I'll go
be with Virginia.

48:59.849 --> 49:01.939
I'll come with you.

49:13.254 --> 49:15.604
Why, John?

49:15.604 --> 49:17.128
Why?

49:18.259 --> 49:20.827
Why did you let this happen?

49:26.876 --> 49:29.792
Surprised they're
having an open casket.

49:29.792 --> 49:32.099
Why do you say that?

49:32.099 --> 49:35.102
Usually, there's not much left
after a plane crash.

49:35.102 --> 49:38.888
He didn't die in a plane crash.

49:38.888 --> 49:41.021
- He didn't?
- No.

49:41.021 --> 49:43.110
The influenza killed him.

49:46.200 --> 49:51.031

50:06.525 --> 50:07.961
Hello?

50:07.961 --> 50:10.355
Vanessa got her head stuck
in the fireplace?

50:12.183 --> 50:14.402
And she wants to sue Santa.

50:14.402 --> 50:15.882
For what?

50:15.882 --> 50:18.276
For emotional chimney trauma.

50:18.276 --> 50:21.366
"Chimney trauma." That's genius.

50:21.366 --> 50:23.498
She cracks me up.

50:23.498 --> 50:25.587
Keep
those eyes closed now.

50:25.587 --> 50:27.372
Keep them closed.

50:29.417 --> 50:33.552
And three, two, one,
open your eyes.

50:33.552 --> 50:36.076
That's
the best one we've ever had!

50:36.076 --> 50:37.251
-  Beautiful.
- Yeah?

50:37.251 --> 50:38.731
- You think so?
-  Yeah.

50:38.731 --> 50:41.386
It was the best one on the lot.
Look how full it is.

50:41.386 --> 50:44.519
Now, I have
one more present just for you.

50:45.651 --> 50:49.176
Now, these are rough, but they
will give you a good idea.

50:49.176 --> 50:52.788
I thought, if we are going
to have our own house...

50:53.833 --> 50:55.922
...I should design it.

50:56.879 --> 50:59.230
Oh, my gosh. Richard!

50:59.230 --> 51:01.623
About 2,500 square feet.

51:02.755 --> 51:05.018
With an open kitchen plan.

51:05.018 --> 51:07.107
Breakfast nook.

51:07.107 --> 51:08.978
I know how much
you love window seats.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.502
Oh, my God.

51:10.502 --> 51:12.939
Vanessa can
have her own bathroom,

51:12.939 --> 51:14.810
and you can have your own
walk-in closet

51:14.810 --> 51:16.334
with a shelf just
for your shoes.

51:16.334 --> 51:18.510
Richard, I didn't
even think you heard me.

51:18.510 --> 51:20.207
- Oh.
- Wait, did you end up

51:20.207 --> 51:22.035
getting the raise
or a promotion?

51:22.035 --> 51:25.125
No, no, but things are
picking up down at the firm.

51:25.125 --> 51:27.954
I-I don't even know what to say.

51:27.954 --> 51:30.087
You don't have to say anything.

51:31.392 --> 51:35.614
Oh, you know,
Billy, I was just your age

51:35.614 --> 51:39.270
when I first passed through
this tiny hamlet.

51:39.270 --> 51:41.446
It's quite strange to me,

51:41.446 --> 51:44.971
coming back to visit my son
after all this time,

51:44.971 --> 51:47.713
and now with my grandson.

51:47.713 --> 51:50.933
Grandpa, will you promise not
to argue politics with Father?

51:52.370 --> 51:53.936
I promise.

51:55.634 --> 51:58.898
Men, I have a dispatch
from headquarters,

51:58.898 --> 52:01.596
signed by
General Washington himself.

52:01.596 --> 52:03.685
The British have surrendered.

52:03.685 --> 52:05.992
The war is over. We have won.

52:07.341 --> 52:08.690
Now what?

52:08.690 --> 52:11.345
Mommy! Mommy!

52:11.345 --> 52:13.304
What happened, honey?

52:13.304 --> 52:15.306
I lost my ribbon.

52:15.306 --> 52:16.872
Your what?

52:16.872 --> 52:20.224
My blue first
place ribbon from school.

52:20.224 --> 52:22.226
You-you lost the what, honey?

52:22.226 --> 52:24.402
- My ribbon!
- Oh, the ribbon.

52:24.402 --> 52:26.621
Where's the last
place you saw it?

52:26.621 --> 52:28.188
In my book bag.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.494
Okay, well, let's go look.

52:29.494 --> 52:30.712
- Come on.
- What's going on?

52:30.712 --> 52:32.366
Oh, we lost
the blue school ribbon.

52:32.366 --> 52:34.020
Oh.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.065
I didn't get the raise.

52:39.199 --> 52:40.679
I'm sorry, Richard.

52:40.679 --> 52:43.464
Mm, well, there's a lot of heads
on the chopping block.

52:43.464 --> 52:47.033
They're downsizing
at headquarters.

53:07.271 --> 53:09.229
- What's going on?
- Look what Mommy found.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.839
Hey, hey!

53:10.839 --> 53:12.798
- Where was it?
- In between the sofa.

53:12.798 --> 53:14.234
How did it get there?

53:14.234 --> 53:16.236
- God put it there.
- Oh, he did?

53:16.236 --> 53:17.672
- Because I prayed.
- Oh.

53:17.672 --> 53:20.588
Well, some people
would call that a miracle.

53:20.588 --> 53:22.024
I'm gonna go put it away.

53:22.024 --> 53:24.505
You better put that
in a very safe place.

53:24.505 --> 53:27.508
A moment

Sorry to disturb you.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.541
We're here from
the Archaeological Society.

54:00.541 --> 54:02.804
We were wondering
if you had a moment.

54:02.804 --> 54:04.632
Yes, certainly.

54:04.632 --> 54:06.417
Please, come in.

54:06.417 --> 54:07.853
Thank you.

54:07.853 --> 54:09.768
You must excuse the mess.

54:09.768 --> 54:11.900
I'm afraid I'm in the middle
of a deep clean.

54:11.900 --> 54:13.946
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, thank you so much.

54:13.946 --> 54:15.295
I'm Earl Higgins,

54:15.295 --> 54:17.906
and these are my prize students,
Todd and Lisa.

54:17.906 --> 54:19.299
It's a pleasure to meet you.

54:19.299 --> 54:21.170
Please, do come in.

54:21.170 --> 54:22.694
Here, sit down.

54:22.694 --> 54:25.218
- Go on.
- I'm sorry about the mess.

54:25.218 --> 54:26.698
Can I get you something?

54:26.698 --> 54:29.309
Um, some lemonade, perhaps?

54:29.309 --> 54:31.572
It's homemade-- my
grandmother's recipe.

54:31.572 --> 54:34.706
No, we don't... we don't want to
take up too much of your time.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.751
Uh, we were just visiting
the historic house

54:36.751 --> 54:38.187
- across the street.
- Oh, yes.

54:38.187 --> 54:39.928
Isn't it marvelous?

54:39.928 --> 54:43.323
Oh, it is one of the reasons
I fell in love with this house.

54:43.323 --> 54:45.717
I am a fan of anything colonial.

54:45.717 --> 54:50.374
Right. Well, we're primarily
involved with the study of
Native American culture.

54:50.374 --> 54:53.290
Uh, this is a rich
archaeological area,

54:53.290 --> 54:55.988
and we have reason to believe
that your property

54:55.988 --> 54:59.165
may potentially
be an important site.

54:59.165 --> 55:00.688
Oh, my.

55:00.688 --> 55:02.342
Well, imagine that.

55:02.342 --> 55:04.170
Will you please
try the lemonade?

55:04.170 --> 55:06.520
It is a family tradition.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.217
Yes? Yes.

55:08.217 --> 55:09.523
Three lemonades coming up.

55:09.523 --> 55:11.482
Sweet or unsweetened?

55:11.482 --> 55:13.005
- Sweet.
- Sweet, sweet.

55:13.005 --> 55:16.138
Uh, would you mind if I took
a look in your backyard?

55:17.357 --> 55:19.968
Well, my husband
isn't home right now, but...

55:19.968 --> 55:21.318
yes, I'm sure that's fine.

55:21.318 --> 55:23.276
This way.

55:23.276 --> 55:25.844
Wow, your yard
is the perfect size,

55:25.844 --> 55:27.585
and there's plenty of access

55:27.585 --> 55:30.065
from the back alley.

55:30.065 --> 55:34.243
Uh, you have a little
fuzzy thing on your chin.

55:34.243 --> 55:37.421
The other side. A little lower.

55:37.421 --> 55:41.207
Oh, yeah, yeah. You got it.

55:41.207 --> 55:43.383
You found my imperfection.

55:43.383 --> 55:45.559
<i>Are you
ready to do the workout?</i>

55:54.438 --> 55:56.048
Hey, Vanessa.

55:56.048 --> 55:58.180
So, what's the story with
that mansion across the street?

55:58.180 --> 56:00.661
William Franklin
once lived there.

56:00.661 --> 56:02.924
Is he the one that planted
the cherry tree or something?

56:02.924 --> 56:05.449
No. Gosh, Bethany,
you're such a spaz.

56:05.449 --> 56:08.495
Thomas Jefferson is the one that
chopped down the cherry tree.

56:08.495 --> 56:10.062
He didn't plant it.

56:10.062 --> 56:13.282
William Franklin is Benjamin
Franklin's illegitimate son.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.459
No shit.
How do you know that?

56:15.459 --> 56:18.157
My mother belongs
to a historical book club.

56:18.157 --> 56:20.202
Cool. My mother belongs
to a book club,

56:20.202 --> 56:21.943
but all they do
is get shit-faced.

56:22.857 --> 56:24.032
Damn.

56:24.032 --> 56:26.252
No more aerobics tonight.

56:44.357 --> 56:47.099
Rose, I'm back!

56:47.099 --> 56:48.840
Everyone's power's out.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.929
The whole neighborhood.

56:50.929 --> 56:54.628
They were out of batteries,
but I got you two candles.

56:54.628 --> 56:56.500
And believe it or not,
they had one copy

56:56.500 --> 56:58.763
of your <i>People</i> magazine left.

57:01.374 --> 57:03.202
Rose!

57:04.377 --> 57:07.119
Oh, my-- Rose!

57:08.555 --> 57:10.470
Richard!

57:12.167 --> 57:14.561
<i>I keep having this dream.</i>

57:14.561 --> 57:19.305
<i>This...
recurring dream.</i>

57:19.305 --> 57:23.178
I'm standing
on a riverbank.

57:25.790 --> 57:28.401
And I see Rose, and she's...

57:29.707 --> 57:33.319
...she's out in the water,
and she's-she's drowning.

57:34.668 --> 57:38.542
And I s-- I swim out to her,
but I can't...

57:40.021 --> 57:42.197
I-I can't save her.

57:42.197 --> 57:44.156
She keeps going under.

57:44.156 --> 57:46.941
I try to pull her in,

57:46.941 --> 57:48.856
but she keeps going under.

57:50.858 --> 57:53.861
There's nothing I can do.

57:53.861 --> 57:55.863
I'm not strong enough,

57:55.863 --> 57:59.519
or I have no power, or I'm weak.

57:59.519 --> 58:02.696
God help me.

58:02.696 --> 58:04.481
Oh, God.

58:06.787 --> 58:08.615
God help me.

59:02.103 --> 59:03.931
What are these?

59:05.193 --> 59:07.282
"Sash motatoes."

59:07.282 --> 59:09.589
Mashed potatoes. That's right.

59:09.589 --> 59:11.112
"Mished topatoes."

59:11.112 --> 59:12.723
Very good, Rose.

59:12.723 --> 59:14.246
I heard that.

59:14.246 --> 59:15.813
Mashed potatoes. Good girl.

59:15.813 --> 59:17.249
How's she doing?
She eat anything?

59:17.249 --> 59:18.598
- She did great tonight.
- Yeah?

59:18.598 --> 59:21.819
- She ate almost every bite.
- Good job.

59:21.819 --> 59:24.561
- Well?
- "Well," what?

59:24.561 --> 59:26.737
- Didn't Ricky tell you?
- Tell me what?

59:26.737 --> 59:29.000
Well, Mr. Day Late
and a Dollar Short.

59:29.000 --> 59:30.479
I can't believe
he didn't tell you.

59:30.479 --> 59:32.220
Tell me what, Al? What?

59:32.220 --> 59:35.528
Me and Rose are
giving you two the house.

59:35.528 --> 59:37.095
All paid off.

59:37.095 --> 59:39.010
I got a little socked away
for a rainy day.

59:39.010 --> 59:40.751
Rose is making progress.

59:40.751 --> 59:44.668
So we decided, come the fall,
we're moving to Florida.

59:44.668 --> 59:46.974
- Florida? But--
- And it turns out our condo

59:46.974 --> 59:49.586
is less than two miles
from Hampstead Neuro,

59:49.586 --> 59:52.327
which is the best stroke
rehab center in the state,

59:52.327 --> 59:53.720
so it's a winner all around.

59:53.720 --> 59:55.504
But wait, how-how
can you afford to--

59:55.504 --> 59:56.897
I ran the numbers.

59:56.897 --> 01:00:00.205
My pension, Social Security,
Rose's disability.

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:01.641
We'll be fine.

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:05.123
Besides, we've been living here
rent-free for years.

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:07.255
But wait, what-what about
Elizabeth and Jimmy?

01:00:07.255 --> 01:00:08.909
It's their house, too.

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:12.043
I never told Ricky, but when my
dad died, he left me some money.

01:00:12.043 --> 01:00:13.522
I've taken care of
Jimmy and Elizabeth.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:14.959
They're thrilled for you.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:18.266
Besides, wild horses
couldn't drag 'em back here.

01:00:18.266 --> 01:00:20.138
I-I don't even
know what to say, Al.

01:00:20.138 --> 01:00:21.922
Don't say anything.

01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:24.446
Except, I don't know,
maybe "thank you."

01:00:24.446 --> 01:00:26.144
You know what?
Come to think of it,

01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:27.972
there is absolutely
nothing to say.

01:00:27.972 --> 01:00:29.408
Say about what?

01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:32.454
Ah, here he is,
Mr. Slower Than Molasses.

01:00:32.454 --> 01:00:35.544
I told Margaret we're
leaving you two the house.

01:00:35.544 --> 01:00:36.937
Al, thank you.

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.896
Yeah, good night.

01:00:39.984 --> 01:00:42.421
I don't want this house.

01:00:42.421 --> 01:00:46.555
Look, it's not like
I haven't been trying.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:48.906
I keep hoping the economy
is gonna turn around.

01:00:48.906 --> 01:00:51.386
We need our own house,
and I want my own life.

01:00:51.386 --> 01:00:53.040
I'll see if I can
get more hours at work.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:54.563
We can make it work.

01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:56.609
Oh, how many more hours
can they give a receptionist?

01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:57.828
Excuse me?

01:00:57.828 --> 01:01:00.265
I have been a secretary
for 18 months.

01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:01.658
Dad gave us a house!

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.181
If we sell it, we'll have to pay

01:01:03.181 --> 01:01:04.704
- capital gains taxes.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:06.445
And if we buy a new one,
there'll be a mortgage.

01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:07.794
Other people
buy houses, Richard!

01:01:07.794 --> 01:01:09.143
And they make it work.

01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:10.710
You have to stop making excuses.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.147
You always find a reason
not to do something.

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:14.583
Well, I will not

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:16.281
- live here forever!
- And I will not gamble...

01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:45.876
Oh, honey,
I'm not sure I like that.

01:01:45.876 --> 01:01:47.704
Who cares, honey? Who cares?

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:50.358

01:02:54.988 --> 01:02:56.250
Yeah.

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.731
We found it not
far from our first site.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:01.255
Wasn't buried very deep--
only a few feet.

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:02.909
Wow.

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:04.693
Oh, we have to show Rose.

01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:05.912
Sure.

01:03:05.912 --> 01:03:07.348
Rose, look what they found.

01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:11.396
They found this here,
right here in the backyard.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:16.270
- Necklace.
- Yeah.

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:17.619
Oh, please don't touch it.

01:03:17.619 --> 01:03:19.621
It's quite sacred.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.105
Beautiful.

01:03:25.105 --> 01:03:26.280
Yeah.

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:35.333

Vanessa. Vanessa, sweetie.

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:41.121
Vanessa, can you be part
of the family, please?

01:03:41.121 --> 01:03:43.471
Okay,
everybody, stay still.

01:03:43.471 --> 01:03:45.996

01:03:48.302 --> 01:03:51.262
Cheese.

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:57.181
Hey,

01:03:57.181 --> 01:03:58.835

the plumber's coming at 10:00.

01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:11.456
- Oh, for the--
- Tomorrow. Yeah.

or for the backyard?

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.459
I'm going
to Bethany's.

01:04:14.459 --> 01:04:16.243
You're not going
out dressed like that.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:18.811
I'm not going out.
I'm going to Bethany's.

01:04:18.811 --> 01:04:21.335
Right, remember curfew--
home by 10:30.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:23.947
Christ almighty, I'm almost 16.

01:04:23.947 --> 01:04:25.774
Ten-thirty.

01:04:28.734 --> 01:04:30.475

01:04:32.912 --> 01:04:35.436

01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:39.049

Where do you keep all the stuff?

01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:33.755
Ah. And how do you like
sleeping on the top bunk?

01:05:35.105 --> 01:05:36.933
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.109
No, you're the first one
in the family to go to college.

01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:42.199
Haven't I told you that
only about a million times?

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:45.942
Well, when do you need it?

01:05:47.117 --> 01:05:49.467

01:05:49.467 --> 01:05:51.599

No, w-wait, wait, wait, wait.
Your mom just got home.

01:05:55.952 --> 01:05:57.866
She wants to say hello.

01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:02.523
Hi, sweetheart.

01:06:02.523 --> 01:06:06.310
I-I sent you a new blanket
and some warm socks.

01:06:06.310 --> 01:06:08.442
Oh, you do? Okay.

01:06:08.442 --> 01:06:10.053
Well, we can talk later. Yeah.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.968
Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

01:06:13.491 --> 01:06:15.667
Our daughter is in college.

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.974
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

01:06:19.497 --> 01:06:21.673
Sure does.

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:31.596
Oh, you're thinking
about Vanessa, aren't you?

01:06:31.596 --> 01:06:33.032
I can tell.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:37.297
It just seems like a moment ago
she left for college,

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:39.996
and now law school?

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.086
Our little girl
is gonna be a lawyer.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.784
She's amazing.

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:47.960
Time sure does fly, doesn't it?

01:06:49.222 --> 01:06:51.050
Law school.

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:53.487
We're gonna have to take
out a loan, aren't we,

01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:55.141
for her tuition?

01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:57.448
We have to mortgage the house.

01:06:57.448 --> 01:06:59.885
It's the only
way we can swing it.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:06.761
Whatever happened to those plans
you drew of that house?

01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:09.025
I put 'em somewhere.
I don't know.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.809
The attic.

01:07:11.853 --> 01:07:14.465
That would've
been a beautiful house.

01:07:27.434 --> 01:07:28.870
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:31.134
<i>I want to make
the toast this year.</i>

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:36.661
This is the first
Thanksgiving without my Rose.

01:07:36.661 --> 01:07:38.967
Sorry. Sorry.

01:07:41.579 --> 01:07:43.581
Now...

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:46.323
Rose, she-she loved
having you all around her.

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:48.020
She loved this day. She loved...

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:49.761
She loved cooking for you.

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:51.806
She lived for you.

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:53.678
And for you, Dad.

01:07:53.678 --> 01:07:56.246
Yeah, and for me.

01:07:58.161 --> 01:08:00.380
- I love you, Dad.
- We all love you, Al.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.078
We sure do.

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:05.342
- To my Rose.
- To Rose.

01:08:05.342 --> 01:08:07.083
To Rose.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:10.260
So, the first thing
you'll say to him is,

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.131
"Officer, my insurance
and registration

01:08:12.131 --> 01:08:14.873
are in my glove compartment."

01:08:14.873 --> 01:08:17.963
Then you're gonna leave one hand
visible on the dashboard,

01:08:17.963 --> 01:08:20.183
and with the other hand,
you will slowly reach around

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:21.749
to your back pocket,

01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:24.883
take out your wallet and give
him your driver's license.

01:08:24.883 --> 01:08:26.145
Next, you're gonna tell him,

01:08:26.145 --> 01:08:29.148
"Officer, I am now
going to open my glove box

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:31.759
and take out my
registration papers."

01:08:31.759 --> 01:08:36.155
And making sure he can see
both your hands at all times,

01:08:36.155 --> 01:08:38.026
you will slowly take
your registration

01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:40.681
out of the glove box
and hand it over.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:44.076
After you hand him the papers,

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:46.339
you're gonna sit as chilly
as a snowman,

01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:49.429
and when he's done,
you will sign the ticket,

01:08:49.429 --> 01:08:52.128
and you will say,
"Thank you, Officer."

01:08:52.128 --> 01:08:53.738
Then you'll put
your turn signal on

01:08:53.738 --> 01:08:58.046
and very slowly and carefully
merge into traffic.

01:09:00.919 --> 01:09:04.227
And you will thank God that that
police officer that stopped you

01:09:04.227 --> 01:09:07.926
had his morning coffee
and was thinking clearly.

01:09:10.407 --> 01:09:12.452
Then you'll get
on with your life.

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:21.418
Richard,
why are the lights out?

01:09:21.418 --> 01:09:23.202
-  Surprise!
-  Oh, my--

01:09:23.202 --> 01:09:26.771
I got it,
I got it, I got it!

01:09:26.771 --> 01:09:29.469
Oh, we got you.

01:09:29.469 --> 01:09:31.254
We got you.

01:09:31.254 --> 01:09:33.125

01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:52.579
You know, Richard said
the other day how time flies,

01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:54.277
but Richard always
says things like that

01:09:54.277 --> 01:09:55.713
that are kind of obvious.

01:09:55.713 --> 01:09:57.671
- Um...
- I do. I do. Yeah.

01:09:57.671 --> 01:10:00.500
And, you know, but it
made me think when I was 30,

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.198
if I thought about 50,
I thought,

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:04.330
"That is an awful long way away,

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:06.898
and I don't really need
to think about it," and...

01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.552
and then I blinked and I'm 50.

01:10:08.552 --> 01:10:10.380
That's crazy.

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.729
Time flies.

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.209
Um, I wish I could say

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.949
that I've done more
with my 50 years.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:19.824
Um, my amazing daughter, though,
she just made senior partner--

01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:22.043
apparently the youngest
to ever do so--

01:10:22.043 --> 01:10:24.785
and she is one tough,
brilliant attorney, isn't she?

01:10:24.785 --> 01:10:26.222
She is that. Yes.

01:10:26.222 --> 01:10:27.397
Yeah.

01:10:27.397 --> 01:10:30.791
Um, but I never
made it to law school.

01:10:30.791 --> 01:10:32.445
Um...

01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:34.839
And I-I never got
to see Paris in the spring,

01:10:34.839 --> 01:10:37.363
and I never got to stay over
in Yellowstone

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.886
because it was too crowded or--

01:10:38.886 --> 01:10:40.148
Sw-Sweetheart, your candles.

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:41.715
Well, no, it's just that I put
things off,

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:44.675
and I kept putting them off.

01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.894
And I would say,
"Oh, we'll do it next year."

01:10:46.894 --> 01:10:48.896
And then that next year
would come, and I'd say,

01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:50.898
"Oh, next year, next year."

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.726
And...

01:10:52.726 --> 01:10:54.815
I don't want to do that anymore.

01:10:54.815 --> 01:10:56.252
Margaret, it's okay.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.819
- Yeah, it's okay.
- Blow out your candles.

01:10:58.819 --> 01:11:00.517
Yeah.

01:11:05.739 --> 01:11:09.700
So, around the time
of the American Revolution,

01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.790
marriage was something equal
to a dictatorship.

01:11:12.790 --> 01:11:16.968
But nowadays, thank goodness, it
resembles something closer to,

01:11:16.968 --> 01:11:19.057
shall we say, a democracy.

01:11:19.057 --> 01:11:22.103
Although not yet
"a more perfect union."

01:11:22.103 --> 01:11:24.758
You see, most couples
like to think of marriage

01:11:24.758 --> 01:11:26.717
as being
together in the same boat,

01:11:26.717 --> 01:11:29.633
doing everything together
in the same boat.

01:11:29.633 --> 01:11:31.243
Fight and make love,

01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.289
and stop making love
and fighting some more,

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:36.553
and then coming together
and doing it all over again.

01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.903
Mostly fighting
for their individual space,

01:11:38.903 --> 01:11:41.993
fighting to be heard,
fighting for their identity.

01:11:41.993 --> 01:11:44.865
I like to call it
fighting over the rudder,

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:49.653
all while their boat is floating
down the river of life.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:52.743
Possibly headed for the falls,
but most couples find solace

01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:56.399
in this idea of
being in the same boat,

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:59.532
because if the boat sinks,
they go down together.

01:12:01.055 --> 01:12:02.709
Margaret, I can't believe

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:05.756
you brought your shrink
into our home.

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.410
Oh, I'm not a psychiatrist.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.672
Well, what are you?

01:12:08.672 --> 01:12:10.108
I'm a life coach.

01:12:10.108 --> 01:12:11.457
Even better.

01:12:11.457 --> 01:12:14.025
A fully accredited
holistic health practitioner.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:15.896
Margaret, I can't believe
that you brought

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.985
this quack
life coach into our home.

01:12:17.985 --> 01:12:19.683
It was my suggestion,

01:12:19.683 --> 01:12:22.250
considering your reluctance
to do the work.

01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:24.862
My reluctance to--

01:12:24.862 --> 01:12:27.038
What is your name again?

01:12:27.038 --> 01:12:28.561
Gilbert Moore, CHHP.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:29.867
You can call me Gil.

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:33.523
Well, Gilbert Moore, CHHP,
get to the point.

01:12:34.828 --> 01:12:37.570
I think you two
belong in separate boats.

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:41.313
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:13:08.775 --> 01:13:10.777
I cannot smell anything.

01:13:10.777 --> 01:13:13.563
Look, my father
fell and broke his hip

01:13:13.563 --> 01:13:15.782
down in Florida,
and the doctors say there were

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:18.219
complications in the surgery,
with an infection,

01:13:18.219 --> 01:13:21.614
so he's gonna be laid up
for quite a while.

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:24.269
He'll have trouble walking
and, you know, getting around,

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:26.750
getting up
and down stairs, so...

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:29.361
Well, we have
to bring him back here.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:32.059
He'll camp out
in our living room.

01:13:32.059 --> 01:13:34.018
We have the sofa bed.

01:13:35.323 --> 01:13:37.674
No.

01:13:37.674 --> 01:13:41.242
No, Mar-Margaret
is not happy with it, no.

01:13:41.242 --> 01:13:42.592
Yeah.

01:13:42.592 --> 01:13:45.812
She's got a lot of stuff
that's going on and...

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:51.209
Look, it's complicated,
and I think that, uh...

01:13:51.209 --> 01:13:52.732
I think...

01:13:54.038 --> 01:13:57.302
I think she's going to leave me.

01:13:57.302 --> 01:13:59.783
<i>God, I'm sorry, Rich.</i>

01:13:59.783 --> 01:14:01.872
<i>You think she's
seeing someone else?</i>

01:14:03.047 --> 01:14:05.528
No, no, it's nothing like that.

01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:09.488
It's just been brewing
for an awfully long time.

01:14:11.011 --> 01:14:12.317
Look, but, um...

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:13.884
we'll talk about this tomorrow.

01:14:13.884 --> 01:14:15.320
-  The strangest thing
just happened.
- Yeah.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.062
I had to pull the car over
on the side of the road

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:20.281
because I forgot where I lived.

01:14:21.369 --> 01:14:24.024
Literally just stopped the car
and had to think about it.

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:28.507
Isn't that odd,
not knowing where you are?

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:31.162
Well, you have
a lot on your mind.

01:14:31.162 --> 01:14:33.512
I'm glad you remembered.

01:14:33.512 --> 01:14:35.993
Anyway, I'm here.

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.431
I'm glad you're here.

01:14:45.829 --> 01:14:48.135
Your new prescriptions
are here on the table.

01:14:48.135 --> 01:14:50.921
Huh? What did you say?

01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:53.097
Your new prescriptions
are there on the end table.

01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:54.968
Huh?

01:14:54.968 --> 01:14:58.537
Your new prescriptions
are there on the end table!

01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:01.061
You know,
you're gonna get old one day.

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:04.674
- Sorry.
- Huh?

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:06.545
I said I'm sorry!

01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:08.765
I heard you the first time.
I was pulling your leg.

01:15:08.765 --> 01:15:11.376
- What do you want to watch?
<i>- Jeopardy!</i>

01:15:11.376 --> 01:15:13.987
- What?
-  <i>Jeopardy!</i> Ugh.

01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:15.467
So, is that everything?

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:17.077
It's everything I've got.

01:15:17.077 --> 01:15:18.731
All right.

01:15:18.731 --> 01:15:21.734
It is a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:15:21.734 --> 01:15:24.737
Very excited that you found
your next house so quickly.

01:15:24.737 --> 01:15:26.565
Yeah, it wasn't easy,
but we got there.

01:15:26.565 --> 01:15:27.784
Yeah.

01:15:27.784 --> 01:15:29.046
So,

01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:30.917
what you think
this is really gonna go for?

01:15:30.917 --> 01:15:32.745
Oh,
it's so hard to say,

01:15:32.745 --> 01:15:36.532
but it's starting to feel like
the market is really taking off.

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:37.968
I expect every offer to come in

01:15:37.968 --> 01:15:40.187
at least ten percent
above asking.

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:42.233
- Oh.
- Maybe 20.

01:15:42.233 --> 01:15:44.496
From your lips
to God's ears.

01:15:44.496 --> 01:15:46.106
Well, in this market,

01:15:46.106 --> 01:15:47.934
I may just have
a direct line with God.

01:15:47.934 --> 01:15:49.632
I really hope so.

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:51.982
I'll be sure to post

01:15:51.982 --> 01:15:53.592
all the pictures
first thing in the morning.

01:15:53.592 --> 01:15:55.376
And email me
if you need anything else.

01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:57.117
I will. Thank you.

01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:58.858
-  Thank you. Good night.
- Okay, have a great evening.

01:15:58.858 --> 01:16:00.207
You, too.

01:16:03.428 --> 01:16:05.038
Hey.

01:16:05.038 --> 01:16:07.214
Hey, what's going on?
Why you crying?

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:11.567
Hey. What--

01:16:13.177 --> 01:16:18.269
Raquel died
like 20 minutes ago.

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:23.579
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

01:16:32.892 --> 01:16:35.155
Are you sure this thing's gonna
fit in the new dining room?

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.027
We had 'em
all measured, honey.

01:16:37.027 --> 01:16:38.811
It seems pretty damn big.

01:16:38.811 --> 01:16:40.465
Made you a sandwich.

01:16:41.901 --> 01:16:43.424
Thank God.

01:16:43.424 --> 01:16:45.035
I'm starving.

01:16:45.035 --> 01:16:47.646
I can't take
care of him, Richard.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:49.779
I just started to
feel like my own person.

01:16:49.779 --> 01:16:51.302
With him being here,

01:16:51.302 --> 01:16:54.000
I feel like I could scream,
I'm so trapped.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.349
And I know that sounds shitty.

01:16:55.349 --> 01:16:56.829
He wanted to come back to us.

01:16:56.829 --> 01:16:58.265
He wanted to come home.

01:16:58.265 --> 01:17:00.224
He wanted to be here, where--

01:17:00.224 --> 01:17:01.791
Here!

01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:03.401
To die.

01:17:05.664 --> 01:17:08.493
- Hey, Dad. What's the score?
- Huh?

01:17:08.493 --> 01:17:10.147
The game-- who's winning?

01:17:10.147 --> 01:17:11.757
Uh...

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:13.193
<i>At the
crossroads of the world,</i>

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:15.021
<i>Times Square
in New York City...</i>

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:22.333
Hey, come on.
It's almost time.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:25.379
<i>In 15 seconds...</i>

01:17:25.379 --> 01:17:27.033
You look so silly.

01:17:27.033 --> 01:17:28.774
It's that time of year.

01:17:28.774 --> 01:17:31.734
Ten, nine, eight,

01:17:31.734 --> 01:17:33.823
seven, six,

01:17:33.823 --> 01:17:36.086
- five, four...
- To better times.

01:17:36.086 --> 01:17:38.958
- ...three, two, one.
- Better times.

01:17:38.958 --> 01:17:41.308
Happy New Year!

01:17:42.701 --> 01:17:44.834
Happy New Year, Richard.

01:17:44.834 --> 01:17:46.487
Happy New Year, Margaret.

01:17:55.845 --> 01:17:57.760
<i>...forensic
scientific standpoint,</i>

01:17:57.760 --> 01:18:00.327
<i>you cannot
definitively prove that.</i>

01:18:04.288 --> 01:18:06.812
Well, my meeting was canceled,
so I figured,

01:18:06.812 --> 01:18:08.727
how about our
favorite breakfast?

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:09.946
Oh, thank you.

01:18:09.946 --> 01:18:12.252
Dad make it to therapy okay?

01:18:12.252 --> 01:18:14.254
Uh, picked up right on time.

01:18:14.254 --> 01:18:16.692
He has a new caregiver.
Her name is Carol.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.171
Carol.

01:18:18.171 --> 01:18:21.087
Vanessa left a message for me
down at the office.

01:18:21.087 --> 01:18:23.220
Did you talk to her?

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.743
I did.

01:18:24.743 --> 01:18:27.093
Uh, what'd she have to say?

01:18:27.093 --> 01:18:29.705
Well, funnily enough,
we talked about you.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.707
Me?

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:34.710
We talked about
what a great artist you are

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.756
and how you always wanted
to be a graphic artist

01:18:37.756 --> 01:18:40.324
back when we met.

01:18:40.324 --> 01:18:43.719
And she wanted to know
why you quit painting.

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:50.334
You know why.

01:18:50.334 --> 01:18:52.597
I don't, actually.

01:18:55.818 --> 01:18:57.820
I had to make a living.

01:18:59.212 --> 01:19:01.388
I had to make money.

01:19:05.610 --> 01:19:07.960
I took an apartment
on High Street.

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:11.964
I can walk to work.

01:19:17.796 --> 01:19:20.494
So you're leaving me?

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:25.325
I am.

01:20:07.541 --> 01:20:10.283
Do you think
you can save it?

01:20:10.283 --> 01:20:11.763
Save what?

01:20:11.763 --> 01:20:14.070
Your marriage.

01:20:15.593 --> 01:20:17.203
I have no idea.

01:20:17.203 --> 01:20:20.337
Your mom and I,
we never had problems like that.

01:20:20.337 --> 01:20:22.905
Yes, you did.

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:24.776
People just
didn't talk about them.

01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:27.344
That's all.
It was a different time.

01:20:27.344 --> 01:20:30.216
Oh, she... she left me once.

01:20:30.216 --> 01:20:31.739
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:31.739 --> 01:20:34.481
You know, you were all little.

01:20:34.481 --> 01:20:37.093
She left for four days,
went to New York,

01:20:37.093 --> 01:20:40.400
saw some plays, went up
the Empire State Building.

01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:44.752
But she came back, Ricky.

01:20:45.884 --> 01:20:48.713
She came back,
and she never left again.

01:20:48.713 --> 01:20:52.325
Yeah, well, it was
a different time, like I said.

01:20:52.325 --> 01:20:54.719
She left her heavy coat.

01:20:54.719 --> 01:20:56.155
Who did?

01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:58.070
Margaret--
she left her heavy coat.

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.376
When you leave something
like that,

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:00.899
it means you want
to come back.

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.032
Margaret's
leaving all kinds of stuff.

01:21:03.032 --> 01:21:05.121
It doesn't mean anything.

01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:10.343
She's been forgetting
a lot of things lately.

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:12.389
Maybe it's time, Ricky.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:13.869
For what?

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:16.306
Maybe you should sell the house.

01:21:17.655 --> 01:21:20.353
Sell the house?

01:21:20.353 --> 01:21:24.444
After all this time,
you've said sell...

01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:31.451
I will tell you
what I am going to do.

01:21:32.975 --> 01:21:35.847
I am going to paint.

01:21:37.283 --> 01:21:38.937
Good.

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.373
Come along, darling.

01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:42.332
It's time to go.

01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:46.118
Mother, I'm going
to miss being here.

01:21:46.118 --> 01:21:48.381
Really?

01:21:48.381 --> 01:21:49.948
I won't.

01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:51.776
Its name was Enza.

01:21:51.776 --> 01:21:53.038
Come along, darling.

01:21:53.038 --> 01:21:54.648
I opened the window.

01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:56.781
In flew Enza.

01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:58.478
I had a little bird.

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:00.611
Its name was Enza.

01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.526
I opened the window.

01:22:02.526 --> 01:22:04.789
In flew Enza.

01:22:04.789 --> 01:22:06.660
I had a little bird.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.967
Its name was Enza.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:11.056
What did I come in here for?

01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:17.367
Why am I here?

01:22:18.977 --> 01:22:20.631
Rose.

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:27.986
I'm coming, Rose.

01:22:31.772 --> 01:22:33.687
I'm coming.

01:22:33.687 --> 01:22:35.167
Rose?

01:22:40.216 --> 01:22:42.044
Don't worry.

01:22:42.044 --> 01:22:43.959
I'm coming, Rose.

01:22:45.873 --> 01:22:47.875
Just wait. I'm coming.

01:22:49.399 --> 01:22:52.184
I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:23:03.239 --> 01:23:07.547
Wallet, watch, keys.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.760
<i>I wanted to thank you
for being there today.</i>

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:48.371
<i>It-it meant a lot.</i>

01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:50.373
<i>It was
a lovely service.</i>

01:23:50.373 --> 01:23:53.028
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't stay
for the lunch, Richard.</i>

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:54.507
Oh, no,
that's all right.

01:23:54.507 --> 01:23:56.770
That's all right.
Just-- But thank you.

01:23:56.770 --> 01:23:59.121
<i>So, are you all right?</i>

01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.600
<i>H-How are you doing?</i>

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.254
I'm okay.

01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:06.650
I'm sad, but I'm okay.

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:09.479
<i>Well, it is sad. Very sad.</i>

01:24:09.479 --> 01:24:11.698
Yeah, and as we've discussed
many times,

01:24:11.698 --> 01:24:13.309
that's an important feeling.

01:24:13.309 --> 01:24:16.573
<i>Mm-hmm. It certainly is.</i>

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:22.231
It was good
that Dad and I had...

01:24:22.231 --> 01:24:26.583
so much time, you know, since he
came back to live here, and...

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:29.151
we talked, we-we-we...

01:24:29.151 --> 01:24:32.371
we sorted
through a lot of stuff.

01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.025
<i>I'm glad.</i>

01:24:34.025 --> 01:24:36.332
<i>Glad you two
were able to do that.</i>

01:24:36.332 --> 01:24:38.725
And, Margaret, I need to...

01:24:40.379 --> 01:24:45.341
Margaret, I have
to apologize to you.

01:24:47.256 --> 01:24:50.607
<i>- Richard, you don't have to--</i>
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

01:24:50.607 --> 01:24:53.566
Margaret, I have to tell you
how sorry I am.

01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:58.093
All I did was worry
about every damn thing.

01:24:59.355 --> 01:25:01.879
In some insane way,
I must have believed

01:25:01.879 --> 01:25:05.404
that worrying would keep
painful things from happening.

01:25:06.753 --> 01:25:08.712
Isn't it ridiculous?

01:25:12.150 --> 01:25:14.065
I'm sorry, Margaret.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:19.157
I'm sorry I wasn't able to be
what you needed me to be.

01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:21.812
<i>Richard, it's okay.</i>

01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:23.509
<i>But thank you.</i>

01:25:24.945 --> 01:25:27.557
Thank you for...

01:25:27.557 --> 01:25:29.298
<i>for saying that.</i>

01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:36.392
<i>We both... [sniffles]</i>

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.786
<i>We did the best we could.</i>

01:25:42.746 --> 01:25:43.921
Yeah.

01:25:44.878 --> 01:25:46.271
Yeah.

01:26:05.116 --> 01:26:07.379
Ring
around the rosie,

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:09.990
a pocket full of posies.

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:14.081
Ashes, ashes, we all fall down.

01:26:17.781 --> 01:26:19.609
<i>We were
walking along the Seine,</i>

01:26:19.609 --> 01:26:22.481
<i>and the sky opened up,
and it just started to pour.</i>

01:26:22.481 --> 01:26:24.744
<i>So we ducked
into this tiny café</i>

01:26:24.744 --> 01:26:27.704
<i>and ended up having
the best baguette of our life.</i>

01:26:27.704 --> 01:26:30.315
<i>Oh, and I must be starting
to look French, by the way,</i>

01:26:30.315 --> 01:26:31.925
<i>because an American tourist</i>

01:26:31.925 --> 01:26:34.232
<i>stopped me and asked me
if I spoke English,</i>

01:26:34.232 --> 01:26:35.929
<i>and I said,</i>"Oui."

01:26:35.929 --> 01:26:37.453
<i>Aw. [mutters]</i>

01:26:37.453 --> 01:26:39.629
<i>You got to see Paris.</i>

01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:41.544
<i>I got
to see Paris, Richard.</i>

01:26:41.544 --> 01:26:44.329
<i>How great
Vanessa was able
to rendezvous with you.</i>

01:26:44.329 --> 01:26:46.157
<i>Oh,
it was wonderful.</i>

01:26:46.157 --> 01:26:49.334
<i>And Vanessa and I decided
we're coming back every year.</i>

01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:50.814
<i>- Just us. No David.</i>
-  <i>Oh.</i>

01:26:50.814 --> 01:26:52.119
<i>Just a
mother-and-daughter trip.</i>

01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:53.512
<i>Oh, why not? Yeah.</i>

01:26:53.512 --> 01:26:55.035
<i>And you know
what else? I'm gonna</i>

01:26:55.035 --> 01:26:58.082
<i>save my pennies to visit
a new country every year.</i>

01:26:58.082 --> 01:27:00.737
That sounds
like a perfect plan.

01:27:00.737 --> 01:27:02.391
<i>Oh,
speaking of plans,</i>

01:27:02.391 --> 01:27:05.089
<i>are Vanessa and David joining
you for Thanksgiving this year?</i>

01:27:05.089 --> 01:27:07.265
They're going to David's folks'.

01:27:07.265 --> 01:27:09.224
Vanessa told me
that David's mother

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.704
is hell-bent on having
Thanksgiving this year

01:27:11.704 --> 01:27:14.011
and there's
nothing we can do about it.

01:27:15.099 --> 01:27:18.363
Well, Margaret, the family
is spread all over the globe.

01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:22.280
No. No. No plans.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.587
No, n-no... no plans.

01:27:24.587 --> 01:27:26.632
So I think I'm
just gonna skip it.

01:27:26.632 --> 01:27:28.199
You?

01:27:30.723 --> 01:27:33.291
Would you really want to?

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:34.945
I'd love that.

01:27:35.989 --> 01:27:38.296
Well, then you got it.

01:27:38.296 --> 01:27:41.560
Thanksgiving dinner,
4:00 p.m., right here.

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:54.747
It's open!

01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:02.755
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:04.496
Oh, you look great.

01:28:04.496 --> 01:28:06.672
-  Aw.
- You do.

01:28:06.672 --> 01:28:08.544
You sure this
is what you wanted?

01:28:08.544 --> 01:28:10.807
Oh, what could be better
for Thanksgiving dinner

01:28:10.807 --> 01:28:12.504
than cold egg rolls?

01:28:12.504 --> 01:28:15.290
Wow, Richard,
you've really been painting.

01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:17.466
Oh, I've been busy, yeah.

01:28:17.466 --> 01:28:19.032
They're great.

01:28:19.032 --> 01:28:20.947
Well, thank you.

01:28:20.947 --> 01:28:23.298
Beautiful.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:25.300
What's this?

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.910
That is you.

01:28:26.910 --> 01:28:28.825
I don't
look like that.

01:28:28.825 --> 01:28:30.087
Yes, you do.

01:28:30.087 --> 01:28:31.741
Oh, my goodness.

01:28:31.741 --> 01:28:33.482
You could actually sell these.

01:28:33.482 --> 01:28:34.918
- Yeah?
- Not that one, though.

01:28:34.918 --> 01:28:36.876
I painted this one just for you.

01:28:36.876 --> 01:28:38.225
Our Vanessa.

01:28:38.225 --> 01:28:39.575
- So beautiful.
- Our masterpiece.

01:28:39.575 --> 01:28:41.359
Oh, that's for sure.

01:28:41.359 --> 01:28:43.753
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:28:43.753 --> 01:28:46.408
Here's a place of honor for you.

01:28:46.408 --> 01:28:49.324
How nice of you to pull out
the folding table.

01:28:49.324 --> 01:28:51.064
It's
a family tradition.

01:28:51.064 --> 01:28:52.805
I thought, why not?

01:28:52.805 --> 01:28:54.416
You know, the damnedest
thing happened

01:28:54.416 --> 01:28:56.983
when I was waiting in line
at the Chinese restaurant.

01:28:56.983 --> 01:28:59.899
For a second,
I forgot why I was there.

01:28:59.899 --> 01:29:01.466
- It scared me.
- Hmm.

01:29:01.466 --> 01:29:04.643
Well, the holidays can be
confusing for a lot of people.

01:29:04.643 --> 01:29:06.297
Yeah.

01:29:06.297 --> 01:29:09.431
- It's good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

01:29:11.302 --> 01:29:13.739
Well, I'll give the blessing.

01:29:13.739 --> 01:29:16.742
Thank you for the sound

01:29:16.742 --> 01:29:19.571
of all the voices
that have been here

01:29:19.571 --> 01:29:23.183
and for bringing
us together today.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.926
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:29:26.926 --> 01:29:28.928
Now, I thought, let's begin
a brand-new tradition.

01:29:28.928 --> 01:29:31.366
Let's start the meal
with fortune cookies.

01:29:31.366 --> 01:29:32.932
Okay.

01:29:32.932 --> 01:29:34.717
- You go first.
- Oh.

01:29:34.717 --> 01:29:37.328
"Help! I'm being held prisoner
in a fortune cookie factory."

01:29:37.328 --> 01:29:39.417
A joke my dad would've said.

01:29:40.505 --> 01:29:42.942
"You will have an adventure."

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:49.253
And what an
adventure it has been.

01:29:51.342 --> 01:29:53.083
What does yours say?

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:02.266
"An old love
will come back to you."

01:30:02.266 --> 01:30:04.442
Mm. That's a good one.

01:30:06.618 --> 01:30:08.664
Is this my good fortune?

01:30:11.493 --> 01:30:13.146
No.

01:30:19.283 --> 01:30:21.111
I've been thinking.

01:30:22.329 --> 01:30:24.375
I'm gonna sell the house.

01:30:25.507 --> 01:30:27.291
Good.

01:31:27.917 --> 01:31:30.223
Careful, now.

01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:32.182
- I got you.
-  Ten?

01:31:32.182 --> 01:31:34.445
Ten, yeah. Ten years.

01:31:34.445 --> 01:31:37.361
Can you believe it? Time flies.

01:31:37.361 --> 01:31:39.189
Careful. You all right?

01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:41.626
Here, I got you. I got you.

01:31:44.150 --> 01:31:47.153
This was our home.

01:31:47.153 --> 01:31:49.112
We lived here.

01:31:49.112 --> 01:31:51.244
You lived here.

01:31:51.244 --> 01:31:52.681
- We lived here?
- Yes. Yeah.

01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:53.943
Here, sit. Sit down.

01:31:53.943 --> 01:31:56.423
I have these chairs.

01:31:56.423 --> 01:31:59.775
Uh, the first time
you came into this house,

01:31:59.775 --> 01:32:01.994
oh,
you looked so beautiful.

01:32:01.994 --> 01:32:04.214
Couldn't take my eyes off you.

01:32:04.214 --> 01:32:06.433
You came to meet
my mom and my dad.

01:32:06.433 --> 01:32:09.001
Now, do you
remember my mom and my dad?

01:32:09.001 --> 01:32:11.874
Rose and Al.

01:32:11.874 --> 01:32:13.092
No.

01:32:13.092 --> 01:32:15.704
Well, we all
lived here together.

01:32:15.704 --> 01:32:17.575
Many, many happy memories.

01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:20.447
I will never forget,
this one night,

01:32:20.447 --> 01:32:24.147
you and I made love
on my mother's sofa right here.

01:32:24.147 --> 01:32:25.627
- No.
- Yes, we did.

01:32:25.627 --> 01:32:28.455
They were all asleep upstairs,
and we were going at it

01:32:28.455 --> 01:32:31.720
- pretty hot and heavy.
-  Oh! No. Oh.

01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.939
Many happy memories here.

01:32:33.939 --> 01:32:35.724
Thanksgiving and Christmas.

01:32:35.724 --> 01:32:40.598
We-we got married right in front
of the fireplace there.

01:32:40.598 --> 01:32:42.208
Oh, my God, you gave birth

01:32:42.208 --> 01:32:44.994
to our daughter, Vanessa,
right here.

01:32:44.994 --> 01:32:48.040
Do you remember
our daughter, Vanessa?

01:32:49.868 --> 01:32:51.217
-  Eh...
- Hmm?

01:32:51.217 --> 01:32:54.046
We raised her in this house.

01:32:54.046 --> 01:32:55.744
We did our best
to be good parents.

01:32:55.744 --> 01:32:57.267
You were a wonderful mother,

01:32:57.267 --> 01:33:00.618
and I-I tried to be
a good father and...

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:02.577
and a good husband.

01:33:03.665 --> 01:33:05.754
I have no regrets.

01:33:06.798 --> 01:33:08.583
Vanessa?

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.977
Yes, our daughter, Vanessa.

01:33:11.977 --> 01:33:14.980
She was and is a firecracker.

01:33:14.980 --> 01:33:17.374
There was this one time she...

01:33:17.374 --> 01:33:19.855
she had won an award
at school-- a ribbon--

01:33:19.855 --> 01:33:22.684
and she lost it,
and she was so upset

01:33:22.684 --> 01:33:26.035
she cried for two days straight
about that lost ribbon.

01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:28.341
- The blue ribbon.
- Yes, it was a blue ribbon.

01:33:28.341 --> 01:33:30.735
I-I remember.

01:33:30.735 --> 01:33:34.652
I found it in the...
in the sofa.

01:33:34.652 --> 01:33:37.220
The brown sofa. I remember.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:42.094
I remember finding it.

01:33:42.094 --> 01:33:44.270
She was so happy.

01:33:46.098 --> 01:33:49.101
And you-you came in the door,

01:33:49.101 --> 01:33:51.408
and you were so happy.

01:33:53.279 --> 01:33:55.325
Oh, I remember all that.

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.458
That was right here.

01:34:01.679 --> 01:34:03.855
I remember being here.

01:34:06.031 --> 01:34:08.033
I love it here.

01:34:10.557 --> 01:34:12.647
I love it here.
