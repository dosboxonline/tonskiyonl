We recognize
the authority

17:33.511 --> 17:36.014
of the named heir,
Queen Rhaenyra

17:36.473 --> 17:40.352
and your own...
as her king consort.

17:41.686 --> 17:42.854

go to face

the Rivermen
honor the old ways

your fealty to him,

19:48.938 --> 19:53.109

answer his call.

19:53.109 --> 19:55.153
And what would
that call be?

19:55.153 --> 19:57.364
In his wisdom,
he has pledged
his house,

19:57.489 --> 19:59.282
and yours, to me.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.992
(Riverlords murmuring)

Lord Oscar, for generations
we have been guided

20:04.496 --> 20:06.623
by the judgment
of your forebears.

20:06.956 --> 20:10.460
Why should we now
follow a boy,
younger than my own sons,

20:10.460 --> 20:11.795
when you will
align with one

20:11.795 --> 20:14.172
who will desecrate
the innocent to
reach his aims?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.548
(Riverlords murmuring)

20:15.674 --> 20:19.844
I did only what was
necessary, my lord.

20:19.844 --> 20:22.180
And I now deliver
to you the traitor

20:22.180 --> 20:24.307
Amos Bracken
and his son.

20:24.307 --> 20:27.811
No more traitor
to his land than you,
Willem Blackwood.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.855
I take to heart
your words, Lord Piper,

20:30.980 --> 20:34.192
and I agree,
I-I-I am young.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.069
(sighs)

20:37.028 --> 20:40.240
And I have no love
for Daemon Targaryen.

20:40.365 --> 20:43.702
He has dishonored himself
and the crown with his...

20:44.577 --> 20:47.330
comportment here.

20:47.330 --> 20:51.334
Nevertheless, having
so little experience
to guide me,

20:51.334 --> 20:55.171
my best course is
to defer to the oath
my grandsire swore

20:55.171 --> 20:59.217
to King Viserys
when he named
Rhaenyra his heir.

21:02.387 --> 21:05.849
I see no reason
to cast aside loyalty

21:05.849 --> 21:09.519
no matter how loathsome
I may find her representative
the prince.

21:09.519 --> 21:10.937

Mind your tongue, boy.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.204
Will you have
our army or not?

21:38.715 --> 21:41.384
I am, in the end,
a Riverman

21:41.384 --> 21:43.553
and the word
of my house stands,

21:43.553 --> 21:46.389

are unworthy of it.

21:54.272 --> 21:56.775
Your Lord Oscar is bold.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.445
But he is perhaps not wrong.

22:01.237 --> 22:04.074
I may have been
a touch enthusiastic

22:04.074 --> 22:06.910
in pursuing my aims.

22:06.910 --> 22:10.413
But don't allow
my failings to...

keep you from supporting
an upright man.

Lord Oscar,
we honor the old ways,

22:16.461 --> 22:18.797

22:18.922 --> 22:22.300
- and the old ways call
for justice to be done.
- riverlord: Yes!

22:22.425 --> 22:24.469

been done.

to the usurper have been
brought to heel.

we unite before
our liege lord...

22:36.272 --> 22:38.483

22:52.372 --> 22:56.334
I accept you as my vassal,
Willem Blackwood...

23:03.466 --> 23:04.718

His Grace the king
required of me.

It is true that he made

have to pursue
such savagery.

23:30.827 --> 23:34.706
You did it...
because you wanted to.

for his acts

This moment of peace
that could potentially be

01:11:42.052 --> 01:11:43.428
the last time for her.

01:11:43.595 --> 01:11:46.097
RYAN: <i>We see her go through
a bit of an awakening.</i>

01:11:46.264 --> 01:11:47.140
<i>When her eyes open,</i>

01:11:47.432 --> 01:11:49.476
snap back into reality
with a sense of purpose.

01:11:49.601 --> 01:11:52.103
I mean, what that purpose is
remains to be seen.

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:59.277
(SPEAKING HIGH VALYRIAN)

01:11:59.444 --> 01:12:01.821
RYAN: <i>The dragonkeepers very
much reject Rhaenyra's idea,</i>

01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:03.114
<i>so Rhaenyra is left alone.</i>

01:12:03.239 --> 01:12:05.075
<i>This was actually Emma's pitch
for Rhaenyra to go</i>

01:12:05.075 --> 01:12:06.910
<i>and, like,
walk amongst the seeds,</i>

01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:09.412
<i>as though a pastor
amongst her flock</i>

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:11.247
in the terms of
a religious cult.

01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:13.583
RHAENYRA:
Suffering will be ended.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:15.835
And without bloodshed.

01:12:21.299 --> 01:12:23.426
RYAN: <i>When you realize that
Rhaenyra is just basically</i>

01:12:23.426 --> 01:12:26.304
<i>throwing stuff against the wall
and seeing whether it sticks</i>

01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.306
<i>and seeing if somebody
can emerge from this,</i>

01:12:28.473 --> 01:12:29.808
<i>it goes very bad, very quickly.</i>

01:12:29.974 --> 01:12:32.519
In many ways, I think there's
a way of looking at that scene

01:12:32.644 --> 01:12:34.437
as ritual sacrifice.

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.522

where I'm running</i>

01:12:40.276 --> 01:12:41.945
<i>through the cavern
in front of Vermithor,</i>

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:44.030
it took a whole day
of rehearsing,

01:12:44.155 --> 01:12:45.657
running it through
with the Steadicam.

(VERMITHOR ROARS)

01:12:47.659 --> 01:12:49.494
<i>They call Vermithor
the Bronze Fury,</i>

01:12:49.619 --> 01:12:51.705
<i>and I think that's
really fitting for Hugh.</i>

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.498
He's quite angry inside.

01:12:53.623 --> 01:12:57.002
Come on!

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:58.169
KIERAN: <i>It's a mystery.</i>

<i>No one really knows
how the Targaryens</i>

01:13:00.296 --> 01:13:02.298
are talking to the dragons.

01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:06.344
RYAN: <i>We wanted to not just see
the same thing again and again,</i>

01:13:06.469 --> 01:13:09.014
which is a guy claiming a dragon
and getting it to bend the neck.

<i>Close my eyes,
pray for a quick death,</i>

01:13:20.859 --> 01:13:21.901
which doesn't come.

01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:23.153
I think it's that supplication

01:13:23.319 --> 01:13:25.697
and the way that he showed
deference to Silverwing

01:13:25.697 --> 01:13:27.574
<i>that probably makes her
choose him.</i>

01:13:27.699 --> 01:13:30.035
But we didn't want to get
too much into the whys and hows.

01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:32.871
We don't really understand
why a dragon chooses its rider.

01:13:33.038 --> 01:13:36.666
I've said I'm a Targaryen.
Turns out, I'm a Targaryen.

SOLDIER: <i>Dragon!</i>

01:13:40.712 --> 01:13:43.173
RYAN: <i>I don't think the news of
Seasmoke really reached Aemond,</i>

01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:44.549

by the way</i>

01:13:44.549 --> 01:13:46.676
<i>Larys and Ironrod
exchanged glances</i>

01:13:46.676 --> 01:13:48.553
when they hear the dragon
flying over the city

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.555
because I think they both
assumed that it's Seasmoke.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:53.892
EWAN MITCHELL: <i>Rhaenyra's raised
new riders in the dragonseeds.</i>

01:13:54.059 --> 01:13:56.019
Aemond retaliates
without even thinking,

01:13:56.019 --> 01:13:57.103
and he goes to meet them.

01:13:57.228 --> 01:13:58.396
Open the gates!

RYAN: <i>He was supposed to be
the special one.</i>

01:14:00.565 --> 01:14:02.275
<i>The fact that somebody else
is out there that did this</i>

01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:03.443
<i>just breaks his brain.</i>

01:14:03.568 --> 01:14:05.070
<i>So, his immediate response is,
of course,</i>

01:14:05.195 --> 01:14:07.405
<i>he rides and gets on his dragon
with the intent of going out</i>

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:08.740
<i>and killing Silverwing.</i>

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.742
And he gets more
than he bargained for.

RYAN: <i>And for the first time

she was faced with,
