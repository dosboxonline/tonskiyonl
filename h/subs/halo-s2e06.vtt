00:01.702 --> 00:04.805
[John] <i>Ackerson left us
down there to die.</i>

00:04.805 --> 00:06.874
<i>No evac, no armor.</i>

00:06.874 --> 00:10.778
<i>- ONI knew we wouldn't make it.</i>
- [Halsey] <i>The city fell.</i>

00:10.778 --> 00:13.614
What happened on Reach wasn't
personal, it was political.

00:13.614 --> 00:16.484
- It was Parangosky.
- The ONI protects itself.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.819
Make them your enemy,
and it won't matter

00:18.819 --> 00:20.121
that you're Master Chief.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.656
When did you leave ONI,
Admiral?

00:22.656 --> 00:24.258
[Cortana]
<i>Please, will you help him?</i>

00:24.258 --> 00:27.328
What are you prepared
to do for me?

00:28.296 --> 00:31.199
What is the value
of this human thing?

00:31.199 --> 00:33.367
Knowledge. Human knowledge.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.104
- What do you know of the Demon?
- He remembers you.

00:36.104 --> 00:38.606
You keep his memories.
Show me.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.808
[Makee] You will be the one to
lead us to the Sacred Ring.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.276
What must I do?

00:42.276 --> 00:44.845
Believe in me.
I am the Blessed One.

00:44.845 --> 00:49.183
Whatever built the Halo
left something in you.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.119
[woman]
<i>It's close now, the monster.</i>

00:51.119 --> 00:53.621
Find me, deliver me, save me.

00:53.621 --> 00:56.590
Do not forsake your name,
Protector.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.092
[Laera]
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

00:58.092 --> 00:59.627
[boy] <i>A boy gave it to me.</i>

00:59.627 --> 01:02.163
- Where is he?
- They took him away.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.566
- [Soren] Who took Kessler?
- The UNSC.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.868
[John]
His name was Vannak-134.

01:07.868 --> 01:10.371
I will find the ones
who caused your death.

01:10.371 --> 01:13.006
<i>And I will end them.</i>

01:13.006 --> 01:16.144
This was my family, my friends!

01:16.144 --> 01:17.978
<i>There's no training for this!</i>

01:17.978 --> 01:19.280
[powerful thrust]

01:19.280 --> 01:21.549
[Kai]
<i>I can't stay and watch.</i>

01:21.549 --> 01:25.153
Are you suggesting I deploy
Silver Team without its leader?

01:25.153 --> 01:26.854
Just me, till John's cleared.

01:26.854 --> 01:31.091
[Ackerson] <i>You and I both know
he's not himself.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.261
[heavy doors open]

01:33.261 --> 01:34.428
[dramatic music rises]

01:34.428 --> 01:35.996
[heels shift en masse]

01:35.996 --> 01:39.032
[dramatic music swells]

01:42.303 --> 01:44.104
[man] <i>Whiskey-uniform one-one.
This is Phoenix.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:45.839
<i>Maintain speed.</i>

01:45.839 --> 01:49.310
[overlapping comms chatter]

01:49.310 --> 01:51.445
[Mullins]
This is what we've trained for.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.980
It's time to pay them back.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.648
[door mechanism whirrs]

01:54.648 --> 01:57.651
[Perez breathing heavily]

01:57.651 --> 01:58.619
[comms chatter]

01:58.619 --> 02:00.221
- [Mullins] Perez.
- [sharp gasp]

02:00.221 --> 02:02.223
You bounce off that hull,
you're gonna spend

02:02.223 --> 02:03.957
your last two hours spinning
into space, and I'm gonna

02:03.957 --> 02:06.026
have to write a report
about what a dumbass you are.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.361
And I hate writing reports.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.829
[Perez]
You ain't gonna write about me.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.664
[woman, over comms]
<i>Assault Unit Javelin,</i>

02:10.664 --> 02:11.699
<i>you are clear for jump.</i>

02:11.699 --> 02:13.033
[Mullins] First squad,

02:13.033 --> 02:15.436
on the beam!

02:15.436 --> 02:17.205
- Spartans!
- [all] Never die!

02:17.205 --> 02:19.407
- [Mullins] Spartans!
- [Perez] Never die.

02:19.407 --> 02:22.810
- [Mullins] On me.
- [man] <i>Godspeed, Spartans.</i>

02:22.810 --> 02:25.446
[breathing heavily]

02:25.446 --> 02:28.949
[Mullins] Javelin-Two,
check your angle.

02:28.949 --> 02:31.084
Maintain formation.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.253
Watch your line!

02:32.253 --> 02:34.021
[whooshing]

02:34.021 --> 02:36.023
[indistinct comms chatter]

02:36.023 --> 02:38.359
- [Perez] Shit.
- [Mullins] Perez!

02:38.359 --> 02:39.960
What the hell are you doing?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.695
- Get back into position.
- [Perez] Put it in your report.

02:41.695 --> 02:42.963
[Mullins] You're not
the only one out here!

02:42.963 --> 02:44.532
- [loud thudding]
- [grunts]

02:44.532 --> 02:45.866
- [Gilroy] High-velocity plasma!
- [Spartan III screams]

02:45.866 --> 02:47.568
- [grunting]
- [Mullins] This is Javelin.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.403
Taking sustained fire
from the Covenant Corvette.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.904
- [Spartan III] Singh's gone!
- [Spartan III] They have a lock.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.440
- [Spartan III] They see us!
- Maintain your lines!

02:52.440 --> 02:53.574
[panting]

02:53.574 --> 02:55.276
[Gilroy] Unknown
number of turrets tracking.

02:55.276 --> 02:56.744
[man, on comms] Javelin Team,
maintain dispersion.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.479
- [Spartan III screams]
- [Mullins] Don't overlap!

02:58.479 --> 02:59.847
- [Spartan III] Break right!
- [panting] Shit, shit.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.750
[Mullins]
On target in three, two, one...

03:02.750 --> 03:04.485
- [indistinct radio chatter]
- [gasping]

03:04.485 --> 03:05.719
[Mullins] Phoenix,
this is Javelin-One.

03:05.719 --> 03:06.754
Phase One complete.

03:06.754 --> 03:07.955
Initiating Phase Two.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.423
[Spartan III]
Fire in the hole!

03:09.423 --> 03:10.924
- [Perez] Wilco, armed!
- [explosion, Perez grunts]

03:10.924 --> 03:13.494
- [Mullins] <i>Bounding overlap.</i>
- [Perez gasping]

03:13.494 --> 03:15.296
- [Okada] Barrier deployed.
- [Spartan III] Move! Move!

03:15.296 --> 03:16.630
[indistinct shout over comms]

03:16.630 --> 03:18.266
[Mullins]
The bridge is on this deck!

03:18.266 --> 03:19.900
[Spartan III, over comms]
<i>Hit him back!</i>

03:19.900 --> 03:23.271
[Perez] Mark smoke
on the deck! Stay back!

03:23.271 --> 03:25.406
- [soldiers grunt]
- [Spartan III] Hayes is down!

03:25.406 --> 03:26.740
- [Perez] Medic!
- [Spartan] Movement on our six!

03:26.740 --> 03:28.509
- [Mullins] We gotta move!
- [Perez] Moving!

03:28.509 --> 03:31.279
- [Okada] Gilroy's smoked!
- [Mullins] Now, Perez! Let's go!

03:31.279 --> 03:33.747
- [Mullins] On me!
- [Perez] Move! Move!

03:35.115 --> 03:36.417
[indistinct shouting]

03:36.417 --> 03:38.752
[Perez] Bridge! Break right!

03:38.752 --> 03:40.588
[Mullins] Move! Go!

03:40.588 --> 03:43.724
- [Mullins] Who's got the spike?
- [Perez] Gilroy! Cover me!

03:44.725 --> 03:46.126
[grunts]

03:46.126 --> 03:47.528
[groans]

03:47.528 --> 03:49.062
- [Okada] You good?
- [Perez] I'm good.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.365
[Okada] Move it!

03:51.365 --> 03:52.766
[Perez] I have it!

03:52.766 --> 03:54.001
[explosion, scream]

03:54.001 --> 03:55.269
[Perez]
Okada's down!

03:55.269 --> 03:57.771
[Mullins] Go! Go!

03:57.771 --> 03:59.940
- [Perez] Frag out!
- [explosion]

03:59.940 --> 04:02.042
- Move!
- [Mullins] Go! Go!

04:02.042 --> 04:03.210
Check your corners.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.946
[Perez panting]

04:05.946 --> 04:07.548
Clear.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.517
[Mullins] I told you,
only rookies say "clear."

04:09.517 --> 04:11.018
[Perez]
And I told you to kiss my--

04:11.018 --> 04:13.321
- [sharp gasp]
- [Perez] Mullins!

04:13.321 --> 04:14.755
[Mullins] Finish it!

04:14.755 --> 04:16.390
[needles whirring]

04:16.390 --> 04:18.025
- [explosion]
- [Perez gasps]

04:18.025 --> 04:21.094
[Perez] Fleet Command,
this is Javelin-Four.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.930
I'm the last one left.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.798
Preparing to spike.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.133
Stand by to connect.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.635
- [explosion]
- [sharp gasp]

04:27.635 --> 04:29.102
[Spartan III]
We don't have it!

04:29.102 --> 04:31.171
[whispers] Goddamn it.

04:31.171 --> 04:33.341
[Mullins]
Take it easy, Spartan.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.942
[door opens]

04:34.942 --> 04:37.911
[soldiers muttering]

04:37.911 --> 04:39.380
[clamor stops]

04:39.380 --> 04:41.882
[Kai] You're all dead.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.351
Again.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.620
The Covenant's
advanced shielding

04:46.620 --> 04:50.758
means that we lose three ships
for every one of these.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.126
Their targeting system
is superior as well.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.829
But that is also their weakness.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.465
Playback, please.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.067
They have no problem
locking onto our attack ships.

05:00.067 --> 05:02.936
But they're less effective
against smaller targets.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.171
That's you.

05:04.171 --> 05:07.608
I can take down an Elite
at 2,500 meters.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.479
But my rifle is useless
against a swarm of bees.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.981
So we're bees now?

05:13.981 --> 05:15.549
You wish.

05:16.617 --> 05:19.152
Bees work together.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.255
Many bodies. One mind.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.491
One mission.

05:24.392 --> 05:28.295
Infiltrate the ship.
Deliver the spike.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.431
The bridge is the nerve center.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.932
[graphics hum]

05:31.932 --> 05:36.169
It's protected on the outside,
not on the inside.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.471
Not from this.

05:37.471 --> 05:39.139
Our intel indicates
that their system

05:39.139 --> 05:40.574
is vulnerable to override.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.444
This spike delivers a virus.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.414
Full system shutdown.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.515
Lights out.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.982
Like a bullet to the brain.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.984
[soft chuckle]

05:50.984 --> 05:52.420
[sighs]

05:54.087 --> 05:56.490
Do you have something you would
like to add, Spartan?

05:58.692 --> 05:59.827
Yeah.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.630
I'd like to add
it's bullshit, ma'am.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.466
We cleared the enemy.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.436
Those rounds came
out of nowhere.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.338
The simulation is random.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.941
So is war.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.478
Dismissed.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.080
[doors slide open]

06:21.348 --> 06:23.651
[Perez] Hey! Hey!

06:25.419 --> 06:26.854
[Kai] Let me be clear.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.490
We are not equals.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.825
I am your instructor.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.496
Do you have a problem with me?

06:35.496 --> 06:37.364
I have a problem with failure.

06:37.364 --> 06:38.866
I have a problem with soldiers

06:38.866 --> 06:40.400
that continue
to repeat mistakes,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.602
jeopardizing not only
their mission

06:41.602 --> 06:43.203
but the lives
of their comrades.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.405
My comrades were all dead.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.074
Is it personal?

06:47.074 --> 06:49.677
Is it 'cause I was on Reach
and you weren't?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.814
One battle doesn't
make you a veteran.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.016
Just makes you lucky.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.356
[Perez]
I know what I signed up for.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.699
Are you telling me
you want to die, Spartan?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.102
No, ma'am.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.774
[dramatic music playing]

07:21.575 --> 07:23.877
[tea service clatters]

07:23.877 --> 07:25.746
[Parangosky]
They grew leaves like these

07:25.746 --> 07:29.683
on a small family orchard
in a place called Sri Lanka,

07:29.683 --> 07:31.351
on Earth.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.786
Dried in the sun,

07:32.786 --> 07:37.558
then borne on the back
of the father 16 miles.

07:37.558 --> 07:41.328
His brown feet, that red earth.

07:41.328 --> 07:43.731
Sold at auction...

07:43.731 --> 07:45.699
then placed upon shoulders,

07:45.699 --> 07:48.435
then upon ships,
then upon seas.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.704
Packaged, purchased,

07:50.704 --> 07:53.006
and poured
into this fragile cup,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.842
just for your lips.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.911
They shouldn't have.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.547
They didn't.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.917
These leaves were actually
engineered in a lab

08:03.917 --> 08:05.118
on Level Four.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.888
Oh?

08:07.888 --> 08:11.592
And why would the ONI
concern itself with making tea?

08:12.392 --> 08:13.894
Because I told them to.

08:15.963 --> 08:20.033
The point is, you drink the tea,
but what you taste is the story.

08:21.735 --> 08:25.105
Stories are important,
but they're delicate things.

08:26.173 --> 08:28.809
Tea, like empires,

08:28.809 --> 08:34.081
centuries of work can be undone
by the smallest of oversights.

08:35.616 --> 08:36.884
[Ackerson sighs]

08:36.884 --> 08:39.653
If you're concerned
about Reach,

08:39.653 --> 08:43.724
then the narrative
remains intact.

08:43.724 --> 08:46.894
A ship penetrated our airspace
less than an hour ago.

08:46.894 --> 08:49.730
I'm told whoever piloted
the vessel

08:49.730 --> 08:53.634
showed some familiarity
with our defense network.

08:55.836 --> 08:59.640
I hope that
you're not blaming me.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.075
They landed less
than 15 kilometers

09:02.075 --> 09:03.510
from where we are now.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.145
Send a team.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.920
Did I mention that, uh,
one of our agents from Aleria

09:12.920 --> 09:15.555
is convinced he saw
Catherine Halsey

09:15.555 --> 09:17.290
boarding a ship
of the same description?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.760
If I told you how many Catherine
Halsey sightings we have--

09:19.760 --> 09:21.962
Nineteen hours ago.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.964
Impossible.

09:25.432 --> 09:26.700
She's dead.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.036
Of course,
he could have been mistaken.

09:29.036 --> 09:32.640
It could be anyone traveling
with, and I quote,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.708
"A scarred man."

09:34.708 --> 09:38.111
Perhaps the largest human
he'd ever seen.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.849
That's not possible.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.784
You keep saying that.

09:46.887 --> 09:51.158
You think that he's alive,
that he's here on this planet?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.861
I suppose we're going
to find out.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.135
[scope optics whirring]

10:02.135 --> 10:07.174
[portentous music rises]

10:12.145 --> 10:16.917
[theme music rises]

11:11.604 --> 11:14.341
[gunfire and explosions]

11:14.341 --> 11:17.978
[heavy breathing]

11:18.846 --> 11:20.413
[grenade powers up]

11:20.413 --> 11:22.115
[grunts]

11:25.052 --> 11:26.119
[grunts]

11:26.119 --> 11:28.088
[muffled explosions]

11:28.088 --> 11:30.123
Pause simulation.

11:32.793 --> 11:35.628
- What are you doing?
- [Kai] I couldn't sleep.

11:35.628 --> 11:37.898
Kai...
[exasperated sigh]

11:37.898 --> 11:39.566
you can't keep coming here.

11:39.566 --> 11:41.969
I mean, don't you think
it's a bit morbid?

11:41.969 --> 11:45.005
- [Kai] I'm training.
- You're punishing yourself.

11:47.474 --> 11:51.278
[gasps and breathes heavily]

11:51.278 --> 11:53.080
Why weren't we here?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.984
All those people we lost.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.086
[Kai panting]

11:59.086 --> 12:00.620
My team.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.090
They're all gone.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.093
[Ackerson]
It didn't just happen to you.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.595
What?

12:10.030 --> 12:12.833
No one escapes
this kind of tragedy.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.138
None of the recruits survived
the Corvette simulation.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.172
They will.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.909
They just need time, preparation.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.878
I need to know we're not sending
them on a suicide mission.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.647
Did you ever ask
for a guarantee?

12:27.647 --> 12:29.182
Did he?

12:31.819 --> 12:34.888
Master Chief is gone.

12:34.888 --> 12:39.827
But you are making the next
generation in his image.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.762
They're not Chief.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.464
I can't make them Spartans.

12:44.464 --> 12:47.000
End simulation.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.538
They are Spartans.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.907
And it's your job
to make them believe it.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.482
[footsteps]

13:02.482 --> 13:04.617
May I have that back?

13:06.553 --> 13:08.155
What is it that you want?

13:09.156 --> 13:12.325
[Soren] What she always wants.
Leverage.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.996
I know where
they took your son.

13:18.698 --> 13:21.401
[somber music rises]

13:24.571 --> 13:26.106
[distant birds cry]

13:27.941 --> 13:31.111
[Soren] This is where
Halsey says it all started.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.379
ONI.

13:34.547 --> 13:37.217
What do you know
about this place?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.785
Onyx.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.721
No maps. No records.

13:43.590 --> 13:44.958
No history.

13:46.359 --> 13:47.827
Just rumors.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.662
Just whispers.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.398
[wildlife]

13:51.398 --> 13:53.700
[Kwan panting softly]

13:54.868 --> 13:56.669
[Soren] They've got Kessler.

13:59.739 --> 14:01.341
There.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
Remind you of anything?

14:04.912 --> 14:07.280
They're still making Spartans.

14:09.883 --> 14:12.285
- [pebbles tumble]
- [gasps softly]

14:14.587 --> 14:19.259
[wind gusting]

14:19.259 --> 14:22.963
[ominous music]

14:25.765 --> 14:30.103
[dramatic music playing]

14:37.244 --> 14:40.480
[Kwan gasping]

14:40.480 --> 14:41.881
[Laera] Halsey's gone!

14:41.881 --> 14:43.483
[Soren] It doesn't matter.
We don't need her.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.785
- I know where Kessler is.
- [John] You better get going.

14:45.785 --> 14:48.321
[Laera]
What are you talking about?

14:49.957 --> 14:52.825
[dramatic music rises]

14:53.927 --> 14:56.129
Soren, we need to move.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.101
[Soren] I can see
what you're thinking.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.269
Don't.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.837
You're all banged up.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.906
You don't have your armor.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.341
Go get your son.

15:09.977 --> 15:11.378
- [gunshots]
- [Kwan gasps]

15:11.378 --> 15:13.180
[man]
Right there!

15:13.180 --> 15:15.082
[panting]

15:15.082 --> 15:17.584
[bullets strike nearby]

15:17.584 --> 15:19.119
[panting]

15:19.119 --> 15:23.323
[grunts]

15:23.323 --> 15:26.893
- [gunshots]
- [men shouting]

15:29.129 --> 15:30.430
[dramatic music playing]

15:30.430 --> 15:33.366
[grunting and yelling]

15:34.567 --> 15:37.704
[screams]

15:37.704 --> 15:40.440
[dramatic music rises, falls]

15:44.277 --> 15:46.679
[disengages firing mechanism]

15:46.679 --> 15:48.348
[weapon drops]

15:48.348 --> 15:50.350
[man] Stand down!

15:58.025 --> 16:03.396
[ominous music playing]

16:03.396 --> 16:05.498
[footsteps in snow]

16:07.467 --> 16:08.801
[Laera] What is it?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.446
[breathing heavily]

16:19.446 --> 16:21.981
[wind rises]

16:21.981 --> 16:24.484
[Kwan gasps]
[distant bird caws]

16:27.520 --> 16:29.156
[distant bird caws]

16:32.159 --> 16:33.293
I...

16:33.293 --> 16:35.128
I know this.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.896
What is it doing here?

16:36.896 --> 16:38.498
- [submachine gun fire]
- [gasps]

16:38.498 --> 16:42.769
[distant man] Stand down!
[shouting indistinctly]

16:42.769 --> 16:43.836
Shit.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.507
[screams]

16:47.507 --> 16:51.611
[gasps]

16:51.611 --> 16:52.945
[whispers] Oh, my God.

16:52.945 --> 16:54.881
[panting softly]

16:56.216 --> 16:57.284
I'm okay.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.921
[Halsey] If you say so.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.191
[Kwan] What is...

17:05.024 --> 17:06.393
How are...

17:09.462 --> 17:10.597
What?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.133
Where are we?

17:14.201 --> 17:16.069
What are you doing?

17:18.571 --> 17:21.308
- How'd you know that was there?
- [latch creaks]

17:24.377 --> 17:25.645
Still works.

17:25.645 --> 17:28.014
After 20 years. Take it.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.349
You've been here before?

17:29.349 --> 17:32.119
Yes. I used to practically
live here.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.787
What is this place?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.956
It's where it all began.

17:38.024 --> 17:40.727
You know, I remember you.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.994
I'm flattered.

17:41.994 --> 17:44.764
- You ruined my best work.
- What?

17:44.764 --> 17:49.202
Before you, John was consistent.
Dependable. A Spartan.

17:49.202 --> 17:51.504
Then he met you
and he became unpredictable.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.606
- Oh, sorry about that.
- Oh, don't be.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.908
Sometimes the introduction
of a new variable,

17:55.908 --> 17:57.244
however insignificant,

17:57.244 --> 18:00.613
can be the catalyst
for huge change.

18:00.613 --> 18:01.981
[Kwan] Thanks?

18:03.750 --> 18:08.921
[ominous music rises]

18:09.622 --> 18:14.661
- [sizzling]
- [growls]

18:28.641 --> 18:31.678
[Uto 'Mdama] There seems to be a
problem with our communications.

18:31.678 --> 18:36.516
I have been unable to contact
High Charity or the Fleet.

18:36.516 --> 18:41.888
When do you expect this
malfunction to be resolved?

18:41.888 --> 18:46.326
It is not a malfunction.
It is my command.

18:46.326 --> 18:52.165
Oh? And why does the Arbiter
command our silence?

18:52.165 --> 18:55.735
Because our mission demands it, priest.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.004
Where are we going?

18:58.004 --> 19:02.375
Perhaps you do not know. Perhaps
you should consult your pet.

19:02.375 --> 19:06.846
My direction comes from
the Hierarchs themselves.

19:06.846 --> 19:10.250
As does your shame.

19:10.250 --> 19:14.487
Some say the Arbiter has lost
his faith in the Prophets

19:14.487 --> 19:16.055
and looks to this human
for guidance.

19:16.055 --> 19:21.528
The human means nothing to me.

19:21.528 --> 19:24.764
I would gladly put these
baseless insinuations to rest

19:24.764 --> 19:27.166
with the stroke of my sword.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.668
[sword whooshes]

19:28.668 --> 19:34.507
She is not mine to kill.
She belongs to the Hierarchs.

19:34.507 --> 19:41.648
Then I will ask their permission
when I return to High Charity.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.619
Which will be...

19:47.554 --> 19:49.188
Soon.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.934
The priest is suspicious.

20:01.934 --> 20:05.472
You have communed
with the Keystone?

20:06.806 --> 20:08.040
Of course.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.743
I am the Blessed One.

20:16.115 --> 20:18.117
[door opens]

20:19.486 --> 20:21.721
[Cortana]
Do you think he knows?

20:24.090 --> 20:25.692
That you're lying.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.228
[combat noise and chaos]

20:29.228 --> 20:30.563
[Okada]
<i>I told you, I can't see!</i>

20:30.563 --> 20:32.064
[Perez]
<i>Where are they?</i>

20:32.064 --> 20:33.433
[Mullins]
<i>Concentrate your fire.</i>

20:33.433 --> 20:35.502
[Perez]
<i>Mullins!</i>

20:35.502 --> 20:36.969
- [gunfire]
- [Okada] <i>Look out!</i>

20:36.969 --> 20:38.471
- [explosion]
- [Perez] Move!

20:38.471 --> 20:40.573
- [Gilroy] Return fire!
- [Mullins] We have to move!

20:40.573 --> 20:44.176
- [Perez] Wait!
- [Mullins] We can't stay here.

20:44.176 --> 20:45.445
[Perez]
We need numbers before we push.

20:45.445 --> 20:46.846
[Mullins] I give the orders!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.881
[Perez] Suppressive fire!

20:48.881 --> 20:50.082
[Mullins] Move it! Now!

20:50.082 --> 20:52.652
[gunfire]

20:52.652 --> 20:54.253
[screams]

20:54.253 --> 20:55.688
[Okada]
<i>Moving! Moving!</i>

20:55.688 --> 20:57.490
[Mullins]
Perez, lock that corridor down.

20:57.490 --> 21:00.026
Okada, Hayes, Olsson,
assault the bridge.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.260
- [Perez] No, ma'am.
- [Mullins] What?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.162
We assault that room
by the book,

21:03.162 --> 21:04.531
<i>they're gonna
pick us apart again.</i>

21:04.531 --> 21:07.133
We all have to go. Same time.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.868
[Mullins]
We stick to the tactics.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.403
[indistinct shouting]

21:10.403 --> 21:11.771
[Perez]
The tactics are bullshit!

21:11.771 --> 21:13.172
We gotta assault in force!

21:13.172 --> 21:14.574
[Okada]
Like the fucking bees, man!

21:14.574 --> 21:15.642
[Perez] Exactly.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.410
[Gilroy] Great.
We're all gonna die.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.211
[Perez]
If we send enough bodies,

21:19.211 --> 21:21.180
it might buy you some time
to spike the system.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.915
[Mullins] You're out of line!

21:22.915 --> 21:24.717
[grunts]

21:24.717 --> 21:26.185
[Spartan III]
<i>Richer is down!</i>

21:26.185 --> 21:27.954
[Mullins]
<i>Gilroy, get up here!</i>

21:27.954 --> 21:30.957
[Perez] <i>We run the same plan,
it'll end the same way.</i>

21:30.957 --> 21:34.060
[Mullins] Perez! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

21:34.060 --> 21:36.228
[Perez]
What it takes. Frag out!

21:36.228 --> 21:37.430
[explosion]

21:37.430 --> 21:41.334
- On me!
- [Spartan III] Move it!

21:41.334 --> 21:43.503
Come on, you can do
better than that.

21:45.572 --> 21:47.106
[Spartan III]
Contact. Rear.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.308
[Perez] This is Javelin-Four.
We've reached the bridge.

21:49.308 --> 21:52.278
[dramatic music playing]

21:52.278 --> 21:53.346
[Perez] Do it!

21:53.346 --> 21:54.781
[spring clicks]

21:54.781 --> 21:56.148
[grunts]

21:56.148 --> 21:58.685
[massive whooshing]

21:58.685 --> 22:02.789
- [energy crackles]
- [Gilroy] Holy shit!

22:02.789 --> 22:04.357
What do we do now?

22:04.357 --> 22:05.892
[Mullins]
Get the hell out of here.

22:05.892 --> 22:06.959
Beginning exfil.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.628
Javelin, on me.

22:10.897 --> 22:11.931
Perez!

22:11.931 --> 22:14.033
You waiting on another medal?

22:14.033 --> 22:16.035
Let's go.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.771
[Perez breathing heavily]

22:20.707 --> 22:23.743
[panting]

22:30.182 --> 22:32.084
[Perez]
Where's the Covenant?

22:32.084 --> 22:34.353
Where are they?

22:36.489 --> 22:38.691
[Mullins] I'm not waiting
around to find out.

22:39.526 --> 22:41.461
See you on the other side.

22:47.434 --> 22:51.738
[Spartans cheering]

22:51.738 --> 22:53.272
- [Gilroy] We did it!
- [Spartan III] Whoo!

22:53.272 --> 22:54.607
[Mullins]
That's how it's done!

22:54.607 --> 22:56.075
- [excited shouts]
- [Spartan III] Finally!

22:56.075 --> 22:57.477
Boom!

22:57.477 --> 22:59.311
[Spartan III]
That's what I'm talking about.

22:59.311 --> 23:00.913
[excited shouts]

23:04.016 --> 23:05.985
- Congratulations.
- Ma'am!

23:07.386 --> 23:09.321
The exfil. It was too easy.

23:09.321 --> 23:10.389
Don't get cocky.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.091
No, that's not what I meant.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.361
After we spiked the system,
we had no more enemy contact.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.900
Take the win, Corporal.

23:24.070 --> 23:29.041
[dramatic music rises]

[cell door slams]

23:43.490 --> 23:45.057
[Briggs] Master Chief.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.425
Nice to see you again.

23:46.425 --> 23:47.727
Last time we met,

23:47.727 --> 23:50.630
you had a weapon
pointed in my face.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.299
I prefer this, don't you?

23:54.967 --> 23:57.436
Eleven of my men
are incapacitated.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.972
One of them may die.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.441
Usually when people
are hurt in combat,

24:02.441 --> 24:04.210
it's 'cause
they're poorly trained...

24:04.210 --> 24:05.612
or poorly led.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.515
So, which was it?

24:10.717 --> 24:13.252
With those Spartans,
your Cobalt friends.

24:14.186 --> 24:17.423
You know, when we found them,
they still had full mags.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.391
Never even got a shot off.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.930
I'm beginning to think Spartans
aren't so scary after all.

24:23.930 --> 24:25.765
I want to see Parangosky.

24:26.733 --> 24:27.767
Who?

24:31.003 --> 24:32.639
- Clip him in.
- [man] Yes, Captain.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.473
[John]
You can tell her I'm coming.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.509
[Briggs]
Yeah, right. I'll do that.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.444
[door clanking]

24:38.444 --> 24:40.279
[man 1] All right, locking
down.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.449
- [man 2] Securing right.
- [cords zipping]

24:54.193 --> 24:56.696
[man screams]

24:56.696 --> 24:58.731
[grunts]

24:59.999 --> 25:01.868
[grunting]

25:03.269 --> 25:04.904
[shouting]

25:04.904 --> 25:06.639
[gasping]

25:06.639 --> 25:08.140
[grunts]

25:11.944 --> 25:13.179
[John] I wouldn't.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.147
[effort grunts]

25:15.147 --> 25:16.248
[gags]

25:16.248 --> 25:18.851
[sharp grunt]

25:23.155 --> 25:24.256
[soft clicking]

25:24.256 --> 25:25.758
[optics trill and whish]

25:25.758 --> 25:28.494
[Ackerson] This was recorded
just over an hour ago.

25:28.494 --> 25:29.929
I'm sorry.

25:29.929 --> 25:33.432
I didn't want
to show it to you, but...

25:33.432 --> 25:35.568
I didn't know what else to do.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.469
He's alive.

25:37.469 --> 25:42.775
[Ackerson]
Seems so, yes.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.144
How?

25:45.144 --> 25:47.947
We're not exactly sure.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.982
But I'm afraid
the most likely explanation

25:49.982 --> 25:55.521
isn't one
you or I want to hear.

25:56.789 --> 26:00.326
Do you remember when I asked
you about John's interaction

26:00.326 --> 26:02.762
with the Covenant agent?

26:02.762 --> 26:04.697
Kai?

26:04.697 --> 26:07.033
You said that there was
no reason

26:07.033 --> 26:09.802
to question
Master Chief's loyalty.

26:12.171 --> 26:16.475
I have to ask if you were
being entirely truthful.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.782
When we got
back from Sanctuary...

26:24.383 --> 26:26.452
he told me he saw Makee.

26:27.620 --> 26:28.755
In the fog.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.924
Before they glassed it.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.961
- But I didn't think he really--
- [Ackerson] It's okay, Kai.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.696
I understand.

26:38.665 --> 26:40.599
You're a good soldier.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.002
And he's the Chief.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.503
Or was.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.206
What does this all mean?

26:47.206 --> 26:49.408
From what we can ascertain,
it would seem

26:49.408 --> 26:51.610
that John-117 maintained
his connection

26:51.610 --> 26:54.413
to the Covenant agent
known as Makee.

26:54.413 --> 26:58.484
And it appears now
that they are working together.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.887
No. No, they can't.

27:00.887 --> 27:04.523
Intelligence places Makee
on Reach during the attack.

27:04.523 --> 27:06.425
- [Kai] No.
- John escaped from Reach.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.094
- How did that happen?
- I don't know.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.697
How did that happen, Kai,
when everyone else--

27:10.697 --> 27:12.431
- [Kai] You're wrong!
- He's here now.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.133
On this planet.
In this facility.

27:14.133 --> 27:17.403
Why is he here? Why is he
attacking UNSC soldiers?

27:17.403 --> 27:18.404
- I don't know!
- Why?

27:18.404 --> 27:19.906
I don't know!

27:19.906 --> 27:22.675
If you have an explanation,
I would love to hear it.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.846
[dramatic music]

27:31.050 --> 27:33.152
Now, I'm going
to tell you something,

27:33.152 --> 27:37.156
and this information
is highly classified.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.292
We know the Covenant
attacked the Visegrad Relay

27:40.292 --> 27:43.062
for a very specific objective:

27:43.062 --> 27:45.131
to cover their assault
on Sword Base,

27:45.131 --> 27:50.336
where they captured
one of the Artifacts.

27:50.770 --> 27:55.407
Fortunately, we were able
to exfiltrate the other Artifact

27:55.407 --> 28:00.679
before the planet fell.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.449
Where is it?

28:03.449 --> 28:05.151
It's here.

28:05.151 --> 28:09.221
[dramatic music plays]

28:16.595 --> 28:18.264
[Cortana]
All civilizations learned

28:18.264 --> 28:19.999
that the position of any object

28:19.999 --> 28:23.870
can be determined relative to
three points in the night sky.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.006
Here.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.742
I feel it here.

28:29.742 --> 28:32.044
I suppose that's
as good a guess as any.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.079
Do you mock me?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.547
You do know what will
become of me

28:35.547 --> 28:38.918
- if I can't find--
- Yes.

28:38.918 --> 28:41.087
And what do you suppose
will become of you?

28:41.087 --> 28:43.189
If you were to use the Artifact
to project yourself

28:43.189 --> 28:44.891
back to the Halo,

28:44.891 --> 28:47.126
you could determine its location
in the stars, the same way--

28:47.126 --> 28:48.627
I can't.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.062
Can't what?

28:55.835 --> 28:57.937
Find it.

28:57.937 --> 29:00.072
I try to go there in my mind.

29:01.073 --> 29:03.843
I touch the Artifact
and nothing happens.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.115
I'm fallen.

29:10.549 --> 29:12.484
I'm being punished.
My gift is gone.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.755
Perhaps we should consider
rational possibilities.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.526
- Now you mock my pain.
- You've seen the Halo before.

29:20.526 --> 29:22.661
I have a record of it here.

29:22.661 --> 29:25.197
[graphics trill and whish]

29:29.735 --> 29:31.537
[soft sob]

29:32.638 --> 29:34.306
[sobbing]
Turn it off.

29:34.306 --> 29:39.812
- I thought it might be help--
- I said turn it off.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.716
I can't go there without him.

29:44.716 --> 29:50.056
[dramatic music rises]

29:50.356 --> 29:51.858
Something changed.

29:54.360 --> 29:57.363
I don't know.
Something between us...

29:57.363 --> 29:58.831
shifted.

30:01.968 --> 30:03.302
I touch the Keystone now.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.906
I look for him,
all I see is the dark.

30:09.375 --> 30:11.143
Perhaps I can help.

30:11.143 --> 30:14.613
I would just need access to your
ship's transmission array.

30:14.613 --> 30:16.748
- Do you think me a fool?
- I do not.

30:16.748 --> 30:19.718
Then don't ask me to trust you.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.889
Can you afford not to?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.996
[dramatic music playing]

30:29.996 --> 30:33.866
[indistinct lively chatter]

30:36.969 --> 30:39.238
[chatter continues]

30:45.544 --> 30:47.914
[chatter continues]

30:47.914 --> 30:50.950
[forceful exhalation]

30:53.752 --> 30:56.322
[lively chatter continues]

31:14.306 --> 31:17.143
[Kwan] You know, Spartans are
the reason my mother's dead.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.980
- Please, can we skip this part?
- What part?

31:20.980 --> 31:23.115
The part where I say
how sorry I am

31:23.115 --> 31:25.151
about some person that
I've never met,

31:25.151 --> 31:26.919
from some place that
I've never been.

31:26.919 --> 31:28.921
The part where you say
how callous I am

31:28.921 --> 31:30.456
for having said that.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.024
Because the truth is,

31:32.024 --> 31:34.193
this is all being played out
on a much larger scale.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.962
And when we get to the end
of this tunnel,

31:35.962 --> 31:38.097
you might actually understand.

31:40.132 --> 31:42.701
This isn't meant to be here.

31:42.701 --> 31:44.303
This shouldn't be here.

31:46.038 --> 31:49.341
- [Kwan] It's a wall.
- [Halsey] I know what it is.

31:49.341 --> 31:51.377
But it shouldn't be there.

31:53.679 --> 31:57.016
The whole cave system
has been changed.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.717
- [Kwan] Uh-huh.
- [wind gusts]

31:58.717 --> 32:01.287
Right.

32:01.287 --> 32:04.190
- This way.
- [Halsey] What is it?

32:05.257 --> 32:06.758
Just a feeling.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.430
[doors whoosh]

32:17.036 --> 32:19.438
[graphics trill and whish]

32:19.438 --> 32:21.273
Load CIC secured zones.

32:34.820 --> 32:37.189
[doors whoosh]

32:38.924 --> 32:43.162
[footsteps]

32:51.970 --> 32:53.772
We lost Vannak.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.311
Riz?

33:00.612 --> 33:01.880
Alive.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.782
[Kai] But not here.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.454
You're alone?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.123
Am I?

33:12.224 --> 33:15.094
I would have given anything
to be there on Reach.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.396
You know that.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.931
But you weren't.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.000
- I had orders.
- From whom?

33:22.801 --> 33:23.869
Parangosky?

33:23.869 --> 33:25.437
From Ackerson?

33:25.437 --> 33:26.938
They're responsible, Kai.

33:26.938 --> 33:29.475
For Reach. For Vannak.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.809
The Covenant's responsible.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.344
The Covenant
didn't take our armor.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.180
The Covenant didn't leave us
down there to die.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.981
What are you talking about?

33:35.981 --> 33:38.250
I'm talking about the people
who sent you down here.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.951
To me. ONI.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.623
They knew an attack was coming.
They let the whole planet burn.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.092
Who sent you?

33:47.526 --> 33:48.694
- What?
- Was it Makee?

33:48.694 --> 33:50.462
She was on Sanctuary.

33:50.462 --> 33:52.931
She was at Visegrad.
She was at FLEETCOM.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.500
- Kai...
- Is she here now?

33:54.500 --> 33:56.968
No matter what I say,
you're not gonna believe me.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.938
I want to believe you.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.207
That's not enough.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.077
Believing me means seeing them
for what they are.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.482
I gotta take you in, Chief.

34:11.517 --> 34:12.818
I'm here for Parangosky.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.554
You can take me in
when I'm done with her.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.855
I can't let you do that.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.826
Well...

34:21.927 --> 34:23.729
I guess you have your orders.

34:23.729 --> 34:25.397
That's right.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.032
That's what it means
to be a soldier.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.101
You're more than that.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.147
[grunts and groans]

34:49.888 --> 34:52.124
How long have we been
together, Kai?

34:54.059 --> 34:55.427
A long time.

34:56.595 --> 34:58.297
And what's that worth now?

34:59.665 --> 35:01.066
[quiet thunk]

35:04.069 --> 35:06.505
[mechanisms engage]

35:07.539 --> 35:10.609
I guess not enough.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.644
[Kai] I guess not.

35:12.644 --> 35:15.147
[John grunts]

35:15.147 --> 35:17.583
This only ends one way.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.319
[John groaning]

35:20.319 --> 35:23.021
There's no use in fighting me.

35:23.021 --> 35:25.157
Don't worry.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.492
I won't.

35:26.492 --> 35:29.060
[John grunts]

35:32.564 --> 35:35.267
Vannak died...

35:35.267 --> 35:37.903
the moment Halsey took him.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.472
Everything was decided.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.677
His life ended when he was 6.

35:46.678 --> 35:48.547
So did mine.

35:48.547 --> 35:50.249
So did yours.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.917
We just didn't know it.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.387
[grunting]

35:56.688 --> 35:58.290
- [Kai] Stay down!
- Ohh!

35:59.858 --> 36:03.395
[John groans and laughs]

36:03.395 --> 36:04.663
That's it.

36:04.663 --> 36:06.532
Don't ask questions.

36:08.534 --> 36:12.604
Don't even think about what's
on the other side of the gun.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.473
Just be their Spartan.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.509
[bones crack, John groans]

36:18.310 --> 36:19.978
[Kai] I know what I am.

36:21.947 --> 36:23.649
What are you now?

36:25.951 --> 36:28.520
Where does the Spartan end,
Kai?

36:33.292 --> 36:35.461
And where do you begin?

36:39.598 --> 36:41.367
[violent groan]

36:42.200 --> 36:43.702
[resounding impact]

36:43.702 --> 36:45.337
This is over, John.

36:45.337 --> 36:47.639
Where's the girl I grew up
with?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.542
[grunts]

36:52.878 --> 36:55.347
[groaning]

37:01.119 --> 37:03.489
[Kai] Stop. Please.

37:09.695 --> 37:11.229
Go ahead.

37:12.364 --> 37:14.466
[Kai] I don't want this.

37:14.466 --> 37:15.601
I know.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.140
An order's an order.

37:24.710 --> 37:28.547
[Kai grunts, inhales]

37:28.547 --> 37:30.181
Do it.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.719
[hesitant gasp]

37:33.719 --> 37:36.087

37:36.087 --> 37:37.856
[yells]

37:37.856 --> 37:39.224
[crash]

37:42.694 --> 37:45.797
[breathing heavily]

37:48.834 --> 37:52.003
[dramatic crescendo]

37:52.003 --> 37:54.373
[Ackerson sighs]

37:59.445 --> 38:02.113
Don't pretend you had a choice.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.282
The attack on Reach
was inevitable.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.185
And he was becoming impossible
to control.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.788
Master Chief is gone.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.590
But his memory, his legend,

38:11.590 --> 38:14.593
will make a million
more Spartans in his place.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.596
And a million more
is what we need to win.

38:18.997 --> 38:21.066
This is your program now.

38:21.066 --> 38:22.834
You made it.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.670
This is what it costs.

38:24.670 --> 38:26.638
I used to feel doubt.

38:27.439 --> 38:29.007
I used to feel guilt.

38:29.007 --> 38:33.712
- And I suppose my concern--
- Are you a religious man?

38:33.712 --> 38:35.146
Not particularly, no.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.349
Then I wouldn't worry about it.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.453
[footsteps depart]

38:43.922 --> 38:45.457
[door opens forcefully]

38:48.427 --> 38:52.297
Admiral, we're receiving
an encrypted transmission.

38:52.297 --> 38:53.899
[Parangosky]
Have you identified the source?

38:53.899 --> 38:57.235
Unknown, ma'am.
It's not a UNSC frequency.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.037
[man]
Data wave outside our spectrum.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.306
High volume.
Tracking point of origin.

39:01.306 --> 39:04.710
Ma'am, our communications
may be compromised.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.144
Give me the room.

39:07.312 --> 39:09.448
- [man] Ma'am?
- Get out.

39:16.321 --> 39:19.257
[dramatic music playing]

39:19.257 --> 39:20.726
[John groans softly]

39:20.726 --> 39:23.695
- [electricity crackling]
- [Cortana] Chief?

39:27.165 --> 39:28.667
[voice echoing]
Master Chief.

39:33.439 --> 39:35.340
[Parangosky] Hello, Cortana.

39:36.808 --> 39:38.176
[Cortana] Admiral.

39:41.246 --> 39:42.781
Where are you?

39:42.781 --> 39:44.883
[electricity crackling]

39:44.883 --> 39:47.519
- Where are you?
- [Cortana] I'm right here.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.220
Where?

39:51.189 --> 39:53.024
- [Cortana] Here.
- [John] Cortana.

39:53.024 --> 39:55.226
[Cortana] Yes, Master Chief?

39:58.363 --> 40:00.265
You don't look so good.

40:01.366 --> 40:02.968
What did they do to you?

40:03.869 --> 40:06.371
Nothing that I didn't
sign up for.

40:07.839 --> 40:09.775
[Cortana]
I need you to get up, Chief.

40:09.775 --> 40:10.909
[affirmative grunt]

40:10.909 --> 40:12.143
[soft groan]

40:12.143 --> 40:13.912
[loud clatter]

40:17.248 --> 40:20.486
They're gone, Cortana.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.489
They're all gone.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.592
[Cortana] But I'm here.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.694
- Yeah.
- I'm here now.

40:31.497 --> 40:34.199
Something terrible
is about to happen.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.267
[soft groan]

40:36.267 --> 40:38.537
What do you want me
to do about it?

40:40.171 --> 40:42.407
You're the Master Chief.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.477
Not anymore.

40:46.745 --> 40:49.481
The Covenant's going to find
the Halo, Chief.

40:49.481 --> 40:51.617
They're going to use it.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.153
It is imperative
that you get there first.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.722
I'm with them now.

40:57.589 --> 40:59.057
They're almost there.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.259
I'm with Makee.

41:04.429 --> 41:09.234
[breathing heavily]

41:09.234 --> 41:10.536
Makee.

41:11.637 --> 41:14.072
I'm with the one
they call the Arbiter.

41:14.940 --> 41:18.409
The one who--
who killed Vannak.

41:19.210 --> 41:22.313
[grunts]

41:25.216 --> 41:26.985
Tell me how to find him.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.355
You need to touch the Artifact.

41:30.355 --> 41:32.423
They're connected.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.127
I don't know where it is.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.463
That's why you have me.

41:39.531 --> 41:41.432
[Cortana disappears]
[John sighs]

41:41.432 --> 41:43.569
[John] Cortana?

41:44.870 --> 41:46.004
Cortana?

41:48.239 --> 41:50.308
[door sensor chimes]

41:50.308 --> 41:52.243
[doors whoosh]

41:52.243 --> 41:56.214
[Cortana] I was able to gain
access to the Covenant systems.

41:56.214 --> 41:58.283
I'm transmitting
location data now.

41:58.283 --> 42:01.519
[graphics trill and whish]

42:01.519 --> 42:04.656
When will the Covenant Fleet
arrive at your location?

42:04.656 --> 42:06.391
Soon.

42:07.826 --> 42:11.329
I believe this fulfills
all of my mission parameters.

42:11.329 --> 42:12.598
It does.

42:13.832 --> 42:16.434
I imagine the UNSC
will be able to attack

42:16.434 --> 42:18.570
the Covenant Fleet now.

42:19.470 --> 42:21.372
I thought you might
be interested.

42:21.372 --> 42:23.809
I've simulated the attack
many times.

42:23.809 --> 42:25.811
Even with the element
of surprise,

42:25.811 --> 42:28.614
- the chances of success are--
- Thank you, Cortana.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.784
Will you be needing
anything else from me?

42:32.784 --> 42:33.919
No.

42:33.919 --> 42:36.521
Because I'm always happy
to be useful.

42:36.521 --> 42:39.925
You've done well.
We're in your debt.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.028
What shall I do now?

42:44.029 --> 42:47.365
As agreed, you'll remain where
you are with the Covenant

42:47.365 --> 42:48.834
and provide information to us

42:48.834 --> 42:51.402
until you're no longer
able to do so.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.504
Is that clear?

42:53.504 --> 42:55.106
Yes, Admiral.

42:57.408 --> 42:58.744
Will I be...

43:00.278 --> 43:02.047
remembered?

43:04.015 --> 43:05.416
How could we forget?

43:10.255 --> 43:11.857
[Makee]
Nothing can be undone.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.026
Have no regret.

43:22.433 --> 43:25.370
[distant tapping echoes]

43:26.504 --> 43:29.107
- [Halsey] Wait.
- [Kwan] What's wrong?

43:29.107 --> 43:31.710
[Halsey gathers breath]

43:33.311 --> 43:35.480
[distant voices speak]

43:38.383 --> 43:40.085
[indistinct chatter]

43:42.453 --> 43:44.355
[Kwan]
Who are these people?

43:46.157 --> 43:47.726
Halsey, stop.

43:56.702 --> 43:59.070
[dramatic music playing]

44:05.944 --> 44:07.578
[Miranda] Halsey.

44:13.384 --> 44:16.354
[Halsey] Do you have any idea
what you're doing here?

44:16.354 --> 44:18.690
[Miranda]
Finishing what you couldn't.

44:21.292 --> 44:22.828
You gave them my research.

44:22.828 --> 44:25.263
[scoffs]
Did you really think

44:25.263 --> 44:28.199
you were the only person
worthy of saving humankind?

44:28.199 --> 44:31.069
These people lack the ability
or the expertise--

44:31.069 --> 44:35.874
Yeah, your work has been
very valuable to all of us.

44:35.874 --> 44:38.043
Without your research,
I never would have been able

44:38.043 --> 44:40.478
to discover your mistake.

44:42.748 --> 44:45.851
[dramatic music rises]

44:54.225 --> 44:57.963
[music subsides]

44:57.963 --> 45:00.999
[Laera]
Soren, what is this place?

45:05.170 --> 45:07.005
Thermopylae.

45:07.005 --> 45:08.573
What?

45:14.079 --> 45:15.580
[Laera] Is that...?

45:18.716 --> 45:21.586
- Soren?
- [distant door opens forcefully]

45:21.586 --> 45:23.021
[Soren] They're coming.

45:23.021 --> 45:24.856
- [Laera] Who?
- We should get out of here.

45:24.856 --> 45:27.292
I don't understand.
Is Kessler here?

45:27.292 --> 45:29.327
[footsteps]

45:29.327 --> 45:31.429
[Kai exhales]

45:38.236 --> 45:40.738
[clink]

45:41.672 --> 45:43.108
[spring clicks]

45:43.108 --> 45:45.643
[Ackerson] I shouldn't
have sent you down there.

45:47.445 --> 45:49.915
I saw what happened with John.

45:50.982 --> 45:52.083
It's my fault.

45:53.218 --> 45:54.853
Put it all on me.

46:00.859 --> 46:03.261
The Javelin Team
completed the sim today.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.396
You see?
I told you they would.

46:05.396 --> 46:06.697
It was just a matter of time.

46:06.697 --> 46:08.399
And after they planted
the spike,

46:08.399 --> 46:11.102
they got to the evac ship
without a hitch.

46:11.970 --> 46:14.072
- Outstanding.
- Is it?

46:15.974 --> 46:17.275
In my experience,

46:17.275 --> 46:19.644
the only thing harder
than getting on a Covenant ship

46:19.644 --> 46:21.579
is getting off of one.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.349
Did you manipulate
the simulation?

46:24.349 --> 46:26.384
The simulation performed
perfectly, as did your Spartans.

46:26.384 --> 46:28.486
You let them win.

46:30.288 --> 46:34.625
Kai, this simulation
doesn't reflect reality.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.261
It conditions soldiers.

46:36.261 --> 46:37.829
I designed it to be difficult.

46:37.829 --> 46:42.133
To push our recruits
to their absolute limit.

46:42.133 --> 46:43.568
And at that moment,

46:43.568 --> 46:46.972
when death seems like
the only outcome,

46:46.972 --> 46:49.207
to reward them.

46:49.207 --> 46:50.741
To give them hope.

46:50.741 --> 46:54.946
Now you want to know
if your Spartans have a chance.

46:54.946 --> 46:58.116
And I am telling you
that they do.

46:59.017 --> 47:00.718
But only if they have belief.

47:00.718 --> 47:03.821
And that is what you have
given them.

47:04.589 --> 47:06.124
You should be proud.

47:06.124 --> 47:09.694
[powerful footsteps]

47:11.329 --> 47:14.099
And what did you give
the people on Reach?

47:14.099 --> 47:15.901
What are you--

47:15.901 --> 47:20.105
Initiate simulation 142-A,
FLEETCOM defense.

47:20.105 --> 47:21.706
[system whirrs]

47:21.706 --> 47:24.675
What are you doing?

47:24.675 --> 47:26.644
John said that you
left him here for dead.

47:26.644 --> 47:28.213
Without his armor.

47:28.213 --> 47:30.581
You saw what he did
to those soldiers.

47:30.581 --> 47:33.451
- You can't trust him.
- But I do.

47:33.451 --> 47:35.086
I always have.

47:36.721 --> 47:39.958
He said that you knew
the Covenant were coming.

47:39.958 --> 47:42.293
That you let
the whole planet burn.

47:48.266 --> 47:51.136
What happened on Reach
was tragic.

47:52.770 --> 47:55.073
And inevitable.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.577
Sometimes events
are beyond our control.

47:59.577 --> 48:01.712
And in those moments...

48:04.649 --> 48:06.151
it's all we can do...

48:06.918 --> 48:08.753
to save what we can.

48:08.753 --> 48:12.390
[portentous music rises]

48:12.390 --> 48:14.725
As I saved you.

48:14.725 --> 48:16.261
End simulation.

48:18.829 --> 48:20.431
You're too late.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.901
I've sent in the Black Ops
to finish what you...

Silence, priest.

50:04.102 --> 50:10.441
A transmission went out from
the ship, not long ago.

50:10.441 --> 50:11.609
I know nothing of this.

50:11.609 --> 50:17.482
Perhaps you know something
of this?

50:17.482 --> 50:21.286
The transmission came
from this human device.

50:21.286 --> 50:27.358
And we tracked it toward
their planets.

50:27.358 --> 50:33.431
