WEBVTT

02:47.421 --> 02:48.922
I'll kill them!

02:49.548 --> 02:50.966
I'll kill them all!

02:51.466 --> 02:53.593
Traitors and villains!

02:53.593 --> 02:55.303
- They dare strike at me!
- Your Grace.

02:55.303 --> 02:57.889
- I am the king!
- Your Grace! Yes, yes.

02:57.889 --> 03:00.350
- I am the king!
- Yes, Your Grace. Please, Your Grace.

03:01.726 --> 03:03.437
Traitors and villains!

03:05.188 --> 03:06.398
Fire from the sky.

03:06.982 --> 03:09.818
This is war! I declare war!

03:11.236 --> 03:13.196
I declare war!

04:09.628 --> 04:11.838
The gates have been shut.

04:13.131 --> 04:15.133
The search progresses.

04:16.176 --> 04:18.178
The villain will be found.

04:19.596 --> 04:22.432
We mustn't be shaken by this.

04:26.144 --> 04:27.896
This act.

04:31.608 --> 04:34.444
- The child.
- The child is dead.

04:37.572 --> 04:39.408
His pain is ended.

04:42.869 --> 04:45.664
But what they've done to my girl.

04:46.248 --> 04:47.457
Yes.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.516
And they will pay for this.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.236
Who will pay?

05:16.236 --> 05:19.448
Whosever hand did this
or caused it to be done.

05:19.448 --> 05:23.910
And what if the hand that's done it
is not who must be blamed?

05:25.537 --> 05:28.832
The gods punish us. They punish me.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.960
For what sin?

05:36.089 --> 05:37.382
Daughter, listen to me.

05:37.382 --> 05:44.389
We will mourn as we must,
but some good may yet come of this.

05:47.058 --> 05:50.437
And where were the members of this council
while the murderer threatened their king?

05:50.437 --> 05:51.730
Were you also threatened, Your Grace?

05:51.730 --> 05:53.023
I could have been!

05:57.110 --> 05:59.738
My son is my legacy!

06:00.906 --> 06:03.658
My son is heir to the Iron Throne!

06:05.619 --> 06:08.955
And where were you,
the Lord Commander of my Kingsguard?

06:08.955 --> 06:11.917
I was abed, Your Grace,
having ordered the Night's Watch.

06:12.501 --> 06:13.502
Abed.

06:14.336 --> 06:15.545
Abed!

06:16.463 --> 06:19.382
Instead of safeguarding
the sanctity of my family!

06:20.008 --> 06:23.053
This is not the time for blind
accusations, Your Grace.

06:23.053 --> 06:24.721
We'll know who did this soon enough.

06:24.721 --> 06:27.265
Who did this? Who-- What?

06:27.265 --> 06:29.726
Is there any question who did this?

06:29.726 --> 06:33.188
Who would do this save
the bitch queen of bastards,

06:33.188 --> 06:35.857
the smug cunt of Dragonstone?

06:35.857 --> 06:39.319
There she sits across the bay,
on her rock, laughing at me.

06:39.319 --> 06:42.155
She's fucking laughing at me!

06:50.414 --> 06:52.124
You wished her life to be spared.

06:52.124 --> 06:54.960
If I may, Your Grace. My Lords.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.045
The guard has detained someone.

06:57.629 --> 07:00.257
The man we apprehended is known to us.

07:01.133 --> 07:02.259
He's a gold cloak.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.761
Noted for his brutal nature.

07:04.761 --> 07:07.264
We caught him,
fleeing the Gate of the Gods

07:07.264 --> 07:09.599
with the child's head in a sack.

07:12.310 --> 07:13.687
I'll kill him myself.

07:13.687 --> 07:17.315
We'd do well to get what information
we can from the blackguard.

07:18.859 --> 07:21.653
I trust in the mastery of your trade,
Lord Larys.

07:21.653 --> 07:23.989
Oh, always studying, always protocol.

07:23.989 --> 07:25.365
We know our enemy!

07:25.365 --> 07:28.618
A king may have more
than one enemy, Your Grace.

07:29.035 --> 07:32.622
We would do well to ascertain
if this is your sister's hand

07:32.622 --> 07:36.001
or if there is a serpent
nestled closer to our bosoms.

07:36.001 --> 07:38.086
I suppose you're right, Ironrod.

07:39.087 --> 07:40.839
Could be anyone.

07:41.882 --> 07:45.093
It could be any one of you in this room.

07:55.061 --> 07:56.897
Lord Jasper is correct.

07:57.689 --> 07:59.983
In one sense,
we must determine what happened

07:59.983 --> 08:02.986
and if we in the Keep are still in peril.

08:02.986 --> 08:05.363
In another sense, of course,

08:07.783 --> 08:09.409
it doesn't matter.

08:12.496 --> 08:14.498
You mean to blame Rhaenyra.

08:15.290 --> 08:17.250
Tell the realm she has done this.

08:17.250 --> 08:20.962
I'll have the realm told nothing.
We were assaulted within our own walls.

08:20.962 --> 08:24.341
Within our own beds.
I will not be seen as weak.

08:24.341 --> 08:26.968
You're already seen as weak, Aegon.

08:28.345 --> 08:29.971
You fucking...

08:36.228 --> 08:39.022
A hasty coronation,
a dragon escaping the pit.

08:39.022 --> 08:40.398
The people see an omen.

08:41.316 --> 08:42.818
They whisper in the streets.

08:42.818 --> 08:45.695
They say, perhaps Rhaenyra
should be queen.

08:45.695 --> 08:50.283
And so, you would name her: monster.
Slayer of infants.

08:50.951 --> 08:53.537
I would do more than that.

08:53.537 --> 08:56.748
A funeral progress.
Let them see the child.

08:56.748 --> 09:01.002
Let them look upon the works
of this pretender to the throne.

09:03.380 --> 09:04.464
Father.

09:07.467 --> 09:09.469
- My king--
- No.

09:10.137 --> 09:13.723
I will not have my little son's body

09:13.723 --> 09:15.600
dragged through the street
like a dead dog.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.686
Not dragged! Honored!

09:18.395 --> 09:22.524
Escorted to the dragon pit
to be burned as a Targaryen prince.

09:23.567 --> 09:24.735
Your Grace.

09:24.735 --> 09:26.611
No.

09:32.826 --> 09:35.454
Let no one say I do not grieve.

09:36.121 --> 09:38.582
Jaehaerys was my grandson.
I loved him.

09:38.582 --> 09:41.501
I will not have him die in vain.

09:42.461 --> 09:44.045
Those who declared for Rhaenyra,

09:44.045 --> 09:46.798
will they still support her
when they hear of her depravity?

09:46.798 --> 09:48.884
Or will they rather not renounce her?

09:51.178 --> 09:55.182
Jaehaerys will do more for us now
than a thousand knights in battle.

10:01.563 --> 10:03.523
You will have your war, Your Grace.

10:03.523 --> 10:08.236
But if you wait a short time,
you may yet double your strength.

10:10.906 --> 10:12.115
Mother.

10:17.370 --> 10:20.540
The Hand sets on a difficult path,
my darling,

10:20.540 --> 10:22.834
but it might be the right one.

10:23.585 --> 10:27.631
Let the Silent Sisters ready the prince
for his final journey.

10:27.631 --> 10:30.842
And riding behind him,
his mother the Queen,

10:30.842 --> 10:32.969
and with her, the Queen Dowager.

10:32.969 --> 10:34.596
No, I do not wish to be a spectacle.

10:34.596 --> 10:38.225
The realm must see
the sorrow of the crown,

10:38.225 --> 10:41.978
a sorrow best expressed
through its most gentle souls.

10:45.148 --> 10:50.362
I think you'll all agree the king himself
must be spared.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.088
There's to be a funeral for Jaehaerys.

11:13.552 --> 11:16.555
We've been asked to ride on a wagon
behind his body.

11:22.018 --> 11:23.437
I don't want to.

11:25.063 --> 11:26.690
Neither do I.

11:28.859 --> 11:30.861
But when a thing like this happens,

11:32.195 --> 11:34.823
a blow to the king is a blow to the realm.

11:35.907 --> 11:37.951
When the people share our grief,
they draw closer to us.

11:37.951 --> 11:39.703
I don't want them closer.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.497
I don't know them.

11:43.665 --> 11:45.584
Sometimes, we have to pretend.

11:47.919 --> 11:48.879
Why?

11:50.046 --> 11:52.507
We are representatives of the throne.
We have a duty.

11:55.469 --> 11:58.263
Helaena, what you saw
last night when you came to my room--

11:58.263 --> 12:00.515
This is for my boy.

13:19.261 --> 13:22.139
I was hired by Daemon Targaryen.

13:22.806 --> 13:25.767
He paid us.
Half now, half when the job is done.

13:25.767 --> 13:28.270
- Who is "us"?
- A ratcatcher.

13:29.229 --> 13:33.400
Employed by the household.
I don't know his right name.

13:42.117 --> 13:48.623
Behold the works of Rhaenyra Targaryen!

13:51.168 --> 13:55.172
Pretender to the throne!

13:58.425 --> 14:00.302
Kingslayer!

14:00.302 --> 14:02.387
Deepest sympathies, my Queen.

14:02.387 --> 14:04.055
Gods be with you, my Queen.

14:04.055 --> 14:05.932
We support you, Queen Helaena.

14:05.932 --> 14:10.020
Defiler of the innocent!

14:17.486 --> 14:22.699
Behold the works of Rhaenyra, the cruel!

14:25.577 --> 14:27.579
Are you gonna hurt me?

14:28.663 --> 14:29.790
No.

14:31.541 --> 14:33.376
But I cannot vouch for His Grace.

14:58.693 --> 15:04.658
Behold the works of Rhaenyra Targaryen!

15:04.658 --> 15:06.493
Our Queen!

15:06.493 --> 15:10.580
Pretender to the throne!

15:13.375 --> 15:15.460
Kingslayer!

15:35.230 --> 15:37.441
Queen Helaena!

15:42.612 --> 15:43.780
What's happening there?

15:46.533 --> 15:48.285
What's going on? Move it, then!

15:53.665 --> 15:56.001
- Queen Helaena!
- Helaena.

16:02.674 --> 16:04.509
Queen Helaena!

16:08.054 --> 16:09.139
Helaena.

16:09.723 --> 16:12.225
Heave! Heave!

16:18.815 --> 16:23.195
A curse, a curse on Rhaenyra,
the monstrous!

16:30.118 --> 16:34.081
It is yet unclear how the Keep itself
was breached.

16:34.081 --> 16:36.416
The boy's head was severed from his body.

16:37.375 --> 16:40.003
Thousands witnessed the procession.

16:40.629 --> 16:43.924
And they are accusing me
of having a hand in this.

16:43.924 --> 16:45.550
It appears so.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.345
There have been messages
sent to that effect

16:48.345 --> 16:49.638
throughout the realm.

16:50.847 --> 16:54.810
We must send our own messages,
denying this vile allegation.

16:54.810 --> 16:56.520
I will do so at once

16:56.520 --> 16:58.855
but I'm not sure they will be received
in good faith.

16:58.855 --> 17:02.275
And we must double our guard,
here and in Driftmark.

17:03.443 --> 17:05.654
There will be swift
retribution in one form or another--

17:05.654 --> 17:07.614
I have seen to it, Your Grace.

17:08.782 --> 17:10.742
Let me fly out on Vermax.

17:10.742 --> 17:12.702
Rhaenys is needed in the Gullet
and I can watch for movements

17:12.702 --> 17:14.746
- from King's Landing.
- No.

17:16.248 --> 17:19.709
It must be said that the damage
to our position is immeasurable,

17:19.709 --> 17:23.422
at a time when we most need loyalty
to our cause.

17:24.214 --> 17:26.216
But it's a lie.

17:27.175 --> 17:29.886
Having lost my own son,

17:29.886 --> 17:34.433
that I would inflict such a thing
on Helaena, of all people.

17:35.517 --> 17:37.227
An innocent.

17:43.316 --> 17:47.779
The death of Prince Lucerys
was a shock and an insult.

17:48.780 --> 17:53.160
A mother so aggrieved might, naturally,
seek relief in retribution.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.078
Are you suggesting, Ser Alfred,

17:55.078 --> 17:58.206
that my grief drove me
to order the decapitation of a child?

17:58.206 --> 18:02.294
I merely thought, perhaps,
an action taken in haste.

18:02.294 --> 18:03.795
Mind yourself.

18:22.856 --> 18:26.234
Did you send assassins to murder children
in their beds?

18:26.234 --> 18:27.944
I sent the queen's vengeance for her son.

18:27.944 --> 18:29.780
What did you tell this "vengeance"?

18:29.780 --> 18:32.074
What did you say to him, Daemon,

18:32.074 --> 18:34.159
that a boy lies dead
and I am accused of killing it?

18:34.159 --> 18:36.495
Mysaria provided me with names
and a subterfuge.

18:36.495 --> 18:41.500
I was clear in my instructions:
Aemond, the brother of Aegon the Usurper.

18:41.500 --> 18:44.211
- I cannot be responsible for a mistake.
- Cannot be responsible?

18:49.800 --> 18:53.887
If Aemond was not to be found,
what were your instructions then?

18:53.887 --> 18:55.347
They did not concern, in any way,

18:55.347 --> 18:57.516
- that of a little child.
- You said that it was your aim

18:57.516 --> 19:01.144
to spill Hightower blood,
and if not Aemond, then anyone would do.

19:01.144 --> 19:03.438
- No.
- You have wounded me.

19:03.438 --> 19:05.482
Weakened my claim to the throne,

19:05.482 --> 19:09.611
my ability to raise an army,
my standing among my own council.

19:09.611 --> 19:11.947
I said no.

19:11.947 --> 19:13.949
I don't believe you.

19:25.252 --> 19:27.879
And so we come to it, at long last.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.553
Cannot trust you, Daemon.

19:36.513 --> 19:41.435
I've never trusted you, wholly,
much though I wished to, willed myself to.

19:43.395 --> 19:46.398
But now I have seen
that your heart belongs only to you.

19:46.398 --> 19:49.484
And when I was a child,
I took this as a challenge.

19:49.484 --> 19:52.070
But I am older now.
I have challenges enough.

19:52.070 --> 19:54.239
- I have served you faithfully.
- Have you?

19:54.239 --> 19:56.992
Or have you used me as a tool

19:56.992 --> 19:59.786
with which to grasp
at your stolen inheritance?

20:18.221 --> 20:20.599
When Ser Erryk brought you the crown,

20:20.599 --> 20:23.310
did I myself not place it upon your brow?

20:23.310 --> 20:27.898
Yes, but before that,
you sought to lead a council of war

20:27.898 --> 20:30.817
while I labored alone in my bedchamber.

20:30.817 --> 20:32.819
And afterward,
when I thought it meet to consider

20:32.819 --> 20:35.072
- the terms our foes put before us--
- A folly! A folly!

20:35.072 --> 20:37.240
To give up my brother's throne
to the traitorous lies

20:37.240 --> 20:39.826
- of Otto Hightower!
- My throne, Daemon,

20:39.826 --> 20:41.286
mine!

20:41.286 --> 20:45.999
I think you used my words as an excuse
to take your own revenge,

20:46.750 --> 20:50.128
to indulge the darkness you keep sheathed
within you like a blade.

20:50.128 --> 20:51.588
You think me some kind of monster--

20:51.588 --> 20:52.923
I don't know what to think of you.

20:52.923 --> 20:55.342
I don't know what you are,
or who it is you serve.

20:55.342 --> 20:57.302
Am I not on my way, even now,

20:57.302 --> 21:02.140
to Harrenhal to raise an army
in your name, Rhaenyra? Yours!

21:09.940 --> 21:14.569
Do you accept me as your queen and ruler?

21:17.489 --> 21:20.700
Or do you cling, even now,
to what you think you lost?

21:23.036 --> 21:25.622
- What I think I lost?
- You did not lose it.

21:25.622 --> 21:27.582
You gave it away

21:27.582 --> 21:31.044
because you thought ever and only
of your own glory

21:31.044 --> 21:32.504
and not of my father in his grief

21:32.504 --> 21:33.880
- who needed you.
- Your father was a coward

21:33.880 --> 21:36.967
who knew I was the stronger son,
that I was the leader of men

21:36.967 --> 21:38.552
and he was afraid to be seen in my shadow.

21:38.552 --> 21:40.178
Is that what you understand
of your own brother?

21:40.178 --> 21:42.931
You know him better than I do,
who was raised at his side?

21:42.931 --> 21:45.892
Do you believe he made you heir
because of your great wisdom?

21:45.892 --> 21:47.227
Because of your virtue?

21:48.145 --> 21:50.480
- How dare you.
- Or did he merely use you as a tool

21:50.480 --> 21:53.984
to put me in my place
because he was afraid of me?

21:53.984 --> 21:56.862
Because he knew your legacy, unlike mine,
would never outshine his own.

21:56.862 --> 22:00.157
He was not afraid of you, Daemon!

22:00.949 --> 22:05.996
He could not trust you
any more than I can trust you.

22:05.996 --> 22:08.915
He was a fool who sought greatness

22:08.915 --> 22:10.709
but shrank from spilling blood
to achieve it.

22:10.709 --> 22:13.003
And I see you will suffer the same fate.

22:14.254 --> 22:16.214
You struck down a child.

22:20.218 --> 22:22.137
It was a mistake.

22:26.725 --> 22:28.435
You're pathetic.

23:03.929 --> 23:05.305
Father?

23:14.523 --> 23:16.733
You wish to see me, Your Grace?

23:25.867 --> 23:31.706
When morning comes, take Moondancer
and keep a watch on King's Landing.

23:31.706 --> 23:33.625
I must know which course
they take next.

23:34.209 --> 23:36.002
I will be vigilant.

23:36.503 --> 23:37.921
I depend on you, Baela.

23:39.172 --> 23:41.633
Stay high and keep your distance.

23:42.884 --> 23:45.512
We can afford no further mistakes.

23:55.063 --> 23:56.565
My father?

24:00.652 --> 24:03.071
He must follow his own path.

25:55.308 --> 25:57.269
If you please, m'lord.

27:21.520 --> 27:23.522
Have you told anyone?

27:26.525 --> 27:28.360
What do you take me for?

27:30.404 --> 27:32.239
One who seeks absolution.

27:33.532 --> 27:36.034
There is none for what I've done.

29:12.881 --> 29:14.508
What is this?

29:17.719 --> 29:19.888
It's a reminder of yesterday, I think.

29:19.888 --> 29:21.807
The procession was muddy.

29:21.807 --> 29:24.309
- I'll replace it hence.
- Do it now.

29:27.521 --> 29:29.231
The night was long, Ser Criston,

29:29.231 --> 29:32.859
- and I had not eaten--
- You defy my authority, Ser Arryk.

29:34.653 --> 29:35.821
I do not.

29:35.821 --> 29:40.325
The white cloak is a symbol
of our purity, our fidelity.

29:41.410 --> 29:43.286
Kingsguard are a sacred trust.

29:43.286 --> 29:47.082
Will you so easily sully
our ancient honor?

30:00.887 --> 30:02.889
I have erred, my lord.

30:04.099 --> 30:05.725
I'll remedy the error.

30:11.064 --> 30:13.692
Where were you when Jaehaerys
was murdered?

30:17.654 --> 30:19.030
With King Aegon.

30:20.699 --> 30:23.827
And you were not in the private quarters
where you might have prevented the crime.

30:24.536 --> 30:27.664
His Grace wished to entertain
his companions in the throne room.

30:27.664 --> 30:29.332
But if you had thought to go upstairs--

30:29.332 --> 30:31.084
Where were you, Lord Commander?

30:32.669 --> 30:35.130
And why has Helaena the queen
been granted no sworn protector?

30:35.130 --> 30:36.548
Surely once she ascended, she--

30:36.548 --> 30:39.593
Your brother is a thief
and a traitor to the crown!

30:48.643 --> 30:50.103
You well know how it pains me.

30:50.103 --> 30:52.147
How are we to know that
you do not secretly share

30:52.147 --> 30:54.649
- his sentiments?
- I denounced him before the king.

30:55.067 --> 30:57.861
We were one soul in two bodies, yes.

30:57.861 --> 31:00.822
If I'd shared his sentiments,
I would've fled with him.

31:02.532 --> 31:05.452
First, your brother betrays us.

31:07.579 --> 31:09.539
And then the young prince

31:10.540 --> 31:14.002
is murdered on your watch.

31:14.002 --> 31:15.504
You are mad, Ser.

31:15.962 --> 31:19.966
- Mad! You cannot think that I did this!
- What I think has no relevance!

31:22.969 --> 31:25.597
You have brought disgrace
upon our ranks

31:28.850 --> 31:31.269
and now you must restore it.

31:32.938 --> 31:34.272
How am I to do that?

31:50.747 --> 31:55.210
You will go to Dragonstone
and strike down Rhaenyra in her own halls.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.631
The way she sought to do with Aemond.

31:59.631 --> 32:02.509
We will pay the princess back
in her own bloody coin.

32:04.511 --> 32:07.472
- Alone?
- Does your courage fail you, Ser Arryk?

32:07.472 --> 32:09.224
It's not a matter of courage.

32:09.224 --> 32:12.853
The castle is defended
against all enemies, now especially.

32:14.187 --> 32:16.148
- How would I enter?
- Your twin serves there

32:16.148 --> 32:17.649
at the pleasure of the so-called queen.

32:17.649 --> 32:20.068
They will mistake you for him
if you play the part.

32:21.069 --> 32:24.823
We are sworn to serve forthrightly,
not to traffic in deception.

32:24.823 --> 32:29.286
Put down the pretender
and you will end a war before it begins.

32:37.335 --> 32:39.296
- If they see the two of us--
- You must not let that happen.

32:39.296 --> 32:42.007
- You would send me to my death.
- Or to triumph.

32:44.676 --> 32:46.636
And glory.

32:52.058 --> 32:54.060
Now, will you go?

32:55.103 --> 32:58.023
Or must I question
your loyalty to the king?

33:03.820 --> 33:07.115
As you command, my lord.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.169
You missed supper.

33:19.711 --> 33:21.171
I wasn't hungry.

33:21.171 --> 33:23.507
I don't think anyone was, really.

33:24.216 --> 33:26.218
Too many empty seats.

33:27.552 --> 33:28.720
Do you know where he went?

33:29.846 --> 33:32.015
Harrenhal, I would think.

33:36.103 --> 33:38.313
Sometimes I think I hate him.

33:41.733 --> 33:44.653
It's hard, with fathers.

33:45.821 --> 33:48.031
What do you remember of my uncle?

33:48.865 --> 33:51.076
He taught us to catch fish

33:52.327 --> 33:55.330
and sing sailors' shanties.

33:55.997 --> 33:57.999
He had a weakness for cake.

33:59.876 --> 34:03.880
And Ser Harwin Strong?

34:05.715 --> 34:09.136
He was gentle, and fierce.

34:11.847 --> 34:15.851
They called him "Breakbones."

34:17.519 --> 34:19.855
He loved us, I think.

34:21.857 --> 34:23.859
Of course, he did.

34:29.197 --> 34:31.032
I miss Luke.

35:11.990 --> 35:14.201
Daemon sent them to kill me.

35:16.661 --> 35:18.288
I was out.

35:19.164 --> 35:20.624
You were with me.

35:21.416 --> 35:23.418
In truth, I am proud

35:24.377 --> 35:26.797
that he considers me such a foe.

35:28.715 --> 35:31.218
And that he seeks to murder me in my bed.

35:32.260 --> 35:34.096
He's afraid of me.

35:34.971 --> 35:36.807
As well he should be.

35:38.100 --> 35:40.393
The boy is grown into a man.

35:40.977 --> 35:43.105
No. Not here.

35:53.323 --> 35:55.659
I do regret that business with Luke.

35:56.993 --> 35:58.745
I lost my temper that day.

35:59.204 --> 36:00.831
I am sorry for it.

36:01.498 --> 36:03.375
I am glad to hear it.

36:06.336 --> 36:08.964
They used to tease me, you know?

36:11.341 --> 36:13.427
Because I was different.

36:15.887 --> 36:19.850
I would remind you only that when princes
lose their temper,

36:19.850 --> 36:22.352
it is often others who suffer.

36:25.564 --> 36:29.192
The smallfolk. Like me.

36:33.905 --> 36:35.198
<i>How is she?</i>

36:36.158 --> 36:37.868
Much the same.

36:49.504 --> 36:52.758
The markets have been running low
since the blockade.

36:52.758 --> 36:55.218
Surely the city cannot yet be
short of food.

36:56.052 --> 36:58.597
I think not, but people are afraid.

36:59.222 --> 37:01.975
Those with means are hoarding
everything they can.

37:04.269 --> 37:07.689
I walked two hours today
to find a chicken for the pot

37:07.689 --> 37:10.442
and paid three times
as much as I should have.

37:24.623 --> 37:26.458
The selfishness of people.

37:27.084 --> 37:30.796
I cannot blame anyone for doing
what I myself would do if I could.

37:30.796 --> 37:33.924
I don't think you'd let children go hungry
while you filled your own cellars.

37:34.883 --> 37:37.094
Lucky we don't have
enough coin to find out.

37:39.471 --> 37:42.474
The king has promised us some relief.

37:44.101 --> 37:45.727
Did he say when?

37:52.567 --> 37:54.778
I'm afraid, Hugh.

38:04.204 --> 38:07.874
I see all your great adventures
have done nothing for your looks.

38:11.503 --> 38:14.756
Well met, brother, after many months away.

38:24.599 --> 38:25.934
I missed you.

38:27.978 --> 38:29.271
Did you slay many pirates?

38:29.271 --> 38:31.481
Oh, more than you, to be sure.

38:31.481 --> 38:32.649
A jest.

38:32.649 --> 38:35.777
One you may regret as you're supping
alone tonight.

38:35.777 --> 38:36.945
I regret it already.

38:37.738 --> 38:39.656
I've broken my teeth on hard tack, Addam.

38:39.656 --> 38:43.368
Say you have a pot of your goat stew
simmering at home.

38:43.368 --> 38:45.078
You're in luck.

38:45.704 --> 38:47.247
In more ways than one.

38:48.081 --> 38:52.002
I hear Lord Corlys himself commended you
for your service to him.

38:54.546 --> 38:56.673
- He did.
- Will you sail with him

38:56.673 --> 38:58.759
when his ship has been repaired?

38:59.634 --> 39:02.095
I am one of a dozen shipwrights
now called from Hull

39:02.095 --> 39:03.805
to attend with all speed to your fleet.

39:05.265 --> 39:06.808
He made no offer.

39:07.601 --> 39:10.103
And I would rather he didn't,
truth be told.

39:10.103 --> 39:12.397
Do not be foolish, Alyn.

39:14.024 --> 39:17.069
To serve with the Sea Snake
is to make your fortune.

39:17.069 --> 39:19.196
Had I such a chance, I would leap at it.

39:19.196 --> 39:21.448
That's because you haven't seen
what I've seen.

39:21.907 --> 39:24.284
There is a war brewing, Addam.

39:24.284 --> 39:25.368
A real one.

39:25.368 --> 39:28.163
Another opportunity
to distinguish yourself.

39:28.163 --> 39:30.707
- Remind him of your worth.
- I need no favors.

39:30.707 --> 39:33.710
But, brother, he owes you,
he owes us.

39:36.046 --> 39:38.048
Does the stew have carrots in it?

39:43.303 --> 39:45.305
I mistrust this silence.

39:46.848 --> 39:50.268
Daemon flies when we most need
his hand at the oar.

39:51.394 --> 39:54.106
Devotion has never sat well with him.

39:54.106 --> 39:58.902
Where he goes,
he wishes to be his own master.

40:00.737 --> 40:03.156
Well, he is the king consort.

40:06.451 --> 40:08.745
But he is not the king.

40:09.538 --> 40:12.082
Neither am I, but I manage.

40:15.335 --> 40:20.006
I too have felt the crown pass over me.
It is a hard thing to accept.

40:22.759 --> 40:26.304
And now Viserys is dead
and all claims are in doubt.

40:27.180 --> 40:30.600
You do not think
Daemon will challenge her?

40:32.602 --> 40:34.229
Not as such.

40:38.275 --> 40:41.236
But neither can he allow her
to command him.

40:41.236 --> 40:42.529
Pity.

40:43.405 --> 40:47.617
I have, on occasion,
found that to be quite enjoyable.

40:52.456 --> 40:54.875
Let us take him at his word.

40:56.084 --> 40:59.087
If he can take Harrenhal,
all may well be forgiven.

41:00.088 --> 41:02.507
In the meantime, I am here.

41:03.925 --> 41:05.010
And Meleys.

41:08.722 --> 41:11.349
We will not let the queen falter.

41:40.295 --> 41:43.298
The lady Mysaria, Your Grace.

41:53.934 --> 41:57.020
You're aware of yesterday's events
in King's Landing?

41:58.647 --> 41:59.940
I am.

42:00.816 --> 42:02.859
Tell me what part you played
in their unfolding.

42:02.859 --> 42:04.528
I had nothing to do with it.

42:04.528 --> 42:07.114
I know you are entwined with
the usurpers,

42:07.114 --> 42:09.574
that you aided them
in denying me my birthright.

42:09.574 --> 42:11.827
I took profits from an inevitability.

42:11.827 --> 42:14.204
I regret it now.

42:14.204 --> 42:15.789
I'm sure you do.

42:18.708 --> 42:19.793
Who are you?

42:21.545 --> 42:23.046
A prisoner.

42:34.975 --> 42:38.562
I gave Daemon two names.
That is the extent of it.

42:38.562 --> 42:41.273
And I did not wish to do that much.

42:41.982 --> 42:43.817
He said it was the price of my freedom.

42:52.909 --> 42:54.911
Does he say otherwise?

42:55.495 --> 42:57.122
He is gone.

42:58.665 --> 43:00.292
For how long?

43:01.418 --> 43:04.379
A week, or forever. I do not know.

43:09.843 --> 43:13.847
He does do that, doesn't he?

43:22.981 --> 43:24.983
You remember me now.

43:28.862 --> 43:30.322
He said he would marry you.

43:32.741 --> 43:37.120
- He said you carried his child.
- Not everyone found the jest funny.

43:37.120 --> 43:42.125
And now it seems he's done it again,
made a promise and then slipped away.

43:42.125 --> 43:45.629
You trade in the secrets of the Red Keep.

43:45.629 --> 43:48.423
Your web runs unseen
through King's Landing.

43:48.423 --> 43:51.843
And now, when my enemy coils
himself to strike at me--

43:51.843 --> 43:56.973
I can do nothing now
but ask you to honor your husband's words.

43:57.474 --> 43:59.476
It would not serve me to set you free.

44:02.104 --> 44:05.440
At best, I lose an asset to my cause.

44:08.110 --> 44:09.903
At worst, you betray me in some foul way.

44:09.903 --> 44:12.948
I have no interest in betraying you,
Your Grace.

44:15.033 --> 44:16.243
So you say.

44:25.419 --> 44:28.130
I was brought to Westeros with nothing.

44:28.130 --> 44:30.924
I toiled in service, I stole.

44:30.924 --> 44:34.010
I sold my own body for coin or bread.

44:34.010 --> 44:36.304
And I listened.

44:36.304 --> 44:38.348
I collected confidences.

44:38.348 --> 44:40.851
I made myself valuable to powerful men.

44:40.851 --> 44:43.186
Bit by bit, I earned my living.

44:43.186 --> 44:46.815
A house, a household, a home.

44:47.399 --> 44:49.151
Then they set it all aflame.

44:50.777 --> 44:54.406
- Who did?
- The Hightowers, I can only assume.

44:55.615 --> 45:00.162
The Hand did not like it
when I showed my teeth.

45:01.955 --> 45:04.332
But I thank him for it.

45:04.332 --> 45:09.463
For too long, I made it
my aim to be of consequence.

45:09.463 --> 45:13.800
But now, I see that was
the wish of a child.

45:14.801 --> 45:18.346
Daemon. Otto Hightower.

45:19.139 --> 45:20.849
Makes no difference.

45:20.849 --> 45:22.934
They will never accept me.

45:23.852 --> 45:26.521
I might as well have remained a whore.

45:32.527 --> 45:33.945
How did you get that scar?

47:13.920 --> 47:15.297
Oh no.

47:16.173 --> 47:17.507
My son.

47:34.107 --> 47:36.693
- Who are they?
- Ratcatchers.

47:38.236 --> 47:39.905
In the king's employ.

47:42.074 --> 47:43.450
What'd they do?

48:11.311 --> 48:13.146
What have you done?

48:17.442 --> 48:19.653
The ratcatchers!

48:20.445 --> 48:23.615
Oh. I had them hanged.

48:26.284 --> 48:30.122
The maggot who took my son
confessed to an accomplice.

48:30.122 --> 48:32.666
He could not say for certain
which man it was, so.

48:32.666 --> 48:33.667
Idiot!

48:33.667 --> 48:35.794
Beware how you speak
to your king, my lord.

48:35.794 --> 48:40.173
The king is my grandson
and my grandson is a fool!

48:40.173 --> 48:43.760
He's worse than a fool!
He's murdered innocent men!

48:43.760 --> 48:45.178
And one guilty one.

48:45.178 --> 48:48.265
And hanged them from the walls
of the city for all to see!

48:48.265 --> 48:50.517
Plot against the king,
and I will pay it back a hun--

48:50.517 --> 48:53.562
They are fathers and brothers and sons!

48:53.979 --> 48:57.566
And their wives and children
gather now at our gates to weep

48:57.566 --> 48:59.234
and curse your name!

49:11.079 --> 49:15.250
With your child's blood,
we bought their approval.

49:15.250 --> 49:18.336
With your mother's tears,
we made a bitter sacrifice

49:18.336 --> 49:20.505
against the deprivations to come.

49:20.505 --> 49:22.758
And you've thrown it away.

49:24.009 --> 49:28.847
After all I've done for you.
Thoughtless, feckless,

49:30.140 --> 49:31.558
self-indulgent.

49:31.558 --> 49:33.518
At least I did something.

49:33.518 --> 49:36.521
I have not answered injury
to the crown with, what?

49:36.521 --> 49:40.025
Wailing and currying favor
with the fishwives?

49:40.025 --> 49:41.693
I will not be thought weak.

49:41.693 --> 49:44.321
Even now, news of Rhaenyra's
monstrous crime

49:44.321 --> 49:45.530
spreads through the realm.

49:45.530 --> 49:49.159
The great houses falter.
They cannot but come to our side.

49:49.159 --> 49:51.495
I wish to spill blood, not ink!

49:52.704 --> 49:54.331
We must act.

49:55.123 --> 49:57.334
Ser Criston Cole has acted.

50:06.176 --> 50:12.182
And what has Ser Criston Cole done?

50:13.433 --> 50:16.061
He has sent Ser Arryk to slay Rhaenyra.

50:21.525 --> 50:22.734
Alone?

50:25.153 --> 50:27.531
He's pretending to be his own twin.
Brilliant.

50:32.411 --> 50:34.413
Gods help us all.

50:34.871 --> 50:37.499
It's time the bitch queen paid a price.

50:40.794 --> 50:44.464
And you acceded to this prank

50:44.464 --> 50:47.300
without consulting me or the council?

50:48.176 --> 50:51.221
Instead of judgment,
you display impetuousness,

50:51.221 --> 50:54.266
and diminish us in the eyes
of our enemy!

50:54.266 --> 50:57.185
Ill-considered, trifling!

51:07.612 --> 51:11.283
Do you never think of your father? His...

51:12.617 --> 51:14.494
forbearance, his...

51:15.412 --> 51:17.664
judiciousness, his...

51:20.667 --> 51:22.794
his dignity.

51:22.794 --> 51:24.713
Fuck dignity!

51:25.422 --> 51:26.882
I want revenge.

51:29.509 --> 51:31.511
My father is dead.

51:33.889 --> 51:35.307
He is.

51:37.184 --> 51:40.020
And we are the poorer for it.

51:54.910 --> 51:57.162
He was right about you.

51:59.831 --> 52:01.666
He made me king.

52:06.254 --> 52:08.465
Is that what you think?

52:15.013 --> 52:18.016
Remove your badge, Ser Otto.

52:25.774 --> 52:27.984
You were my father's Hand.

52:29.277 --> 52:30.695
Not mine.

52:31.571 --> 52:32.989
Take it off.

52:35.242 --> 52:37.119
You wouldn't dare.

52:40.163 --> 52:41.832
I have dared

52:42.707 --> 52:44.960
and I find it stimulating.

52:54.803 --> 52:56.805
Insolent pup.

53:00.767 --> 53:06.273
You think yourself clever,
but without a strong Hand at your side

53:08.984 --> 53:10.193
to guide?

53:13.905 --> 53:15.282
Give it to Cole.

53:20.036 --> 53:21.246
Your Grace?

53:25.751 --> 53:29.045
In this hour, you have proven yourself
of more worth

53:29.045 --> 53:31.339
than a hundred old men.

53:34.676 --> 53:39.014
My new Hand will be a steel fist.

53:39.806 --> 53:44.561
You will regret this.

53:46.188 --> 53:47.814
Give it to him.

54:05.582 --> 54:07.375
You are dismissed.

54:18.136 --> 54:19.888
<i>I do not know if I trust you.</i>

54:20.597 --> 54:24.434
And I sense that there is danger
in you yet.

54:26.061 --> 54:29.064
But I will keep the word of my house
if you say that it was given.

54:37.322 --> 54:38.365
You may go.

54:39.825 --> 54:41.159
Your Grace.

54:41.159 --> 54:44.746
There's a Velaryon ship in the harbor
bound for Myr by way of Pentos.

54:44.746 --> 54:46.832
I will see that you are given passage.

54:47.499 --> 54:49.626
I'm not so unworldly
as to let you fly free.

54:50.001 --> 54:53.004
I am-- Thank you.

54:56.049 --> 54:58.427
Ser Erryk, Mysaria will be leaving us.

54:58.427 --> 55:00.137
Let her collect her things.

55:00.137 --> 55:03.515
Then have someone take her down
and secure her berth on the "Corwyn."

55:03.515 --> 55:04.808
Your Grace.

55:50.812 --> 55:52.439
A moment.

56:21.843 --> 56:23.303
Ser Erryk.

56:24.387 --> 56:28.266
- I thought you were within.
- A sorry lack of vigilance.

56:28.266 --> 56:30.060
The enemy is about, good ser.

58:31.640 --> 58:34.017
Please try and lay down, Your Grace.

58:34.017 --> 58:36.103
Thank you, Elinda.

58:59.793 --> 59:01.211
Ser Erryk.

59:03.213 --> 59:05.048
It's been a strange day.

59:05.841 --> 59:08.760
I'm restless.
I will stand this evening's duty.

59:22.566 --> 59:24.568
You must sleep tonight, Your Grace.

59:25.068 --> 59:26.862
Let me ask the maester for a draught.

59:27.696 --> 59:29.531
Perhaps that would be best.

59:31.324 --> 59:32.701
Thank you, Elinda.

59:43.920 --> 59:45.338
Ser Erryk?

59:53.096 --> 59:56.391
Believe me, I had no choice.

59:56.391 --> 59:58.310
I don't understand.

59:58.310 --> 59:59.728
Brother!

01:00:02.355 --> 01:00:03.648
Do not do this.

01:00:04.524 --> 01:00:05.859
I beg you.

01:00:07.986 --> 01:00:09.988
You were the one who betrayed us, Erryk.

01:00:32.302 --> 01:00:34.805
Run, Elinda! Run and find Ser Lorent!

01:01:12.926 --> 01:01:14.636
- Your Grace!
- Ser Lorent!

01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:22.436
With me, Your Grace!

01:01:28.608 --> 01:01:29.651
Which? Which is Erryk?

01:01:40.704 --> 01:01:43.915
- We were born together.
- You parted us!

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:48.003
But I still love you, brother.

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:42.599
Your Grace.

01:02:46.311 --> 01:02:47.521
Erryk.

01:02:48.396 --> 01:02:49.815
Forgive me.

01:02:50.774 --> 01:02:51.608
No!

01:02:52.275 --> 01:02:53.276
No!

01:03:02.702 --> 01:03:06.331
It is ignorance and vanity.

01:03:08.166 --> 01:03:11.586
You know as well as I do that Aegon
must be kept in check.

01:03:11.586 --> 01:03:14.256
As does Ser Criston.
The two of them together.

01:03:15.841 --> 01:03:17.843
Ser Criston is not temperate

01:03:18.885 --> 01:03:20.345
but his devotion cannot be questioned.

01:03:20.345 --> 01:03:23.265
- If it does come to war--
- He's ensured it.

01:03:23.849 --> 01:03:27.936
He's young and unschooled.
His faith is in steel and bone.

01:03:27.936 --> 01:03:30.230
He has not the long view.

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:31.731
None of them do.

01:03:32.357 --> 01:03:34.109
They wish now not for the good
of the realm

01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:38.155
but for the petty satisfaction
of vengeance.

01:03:41.658 --> 01:03:42.993
Aegon is still malleable.

01:03:44.286 --> 01:03:47.038
It is the death of the child
that has unstrung him.

01:03:53.712 --> 01:03:55.714
I can't stay here.

01:03:57.674 --> 01:03:59.885
Exiled from the council.

01:04:01.344 --> 01:04:05.599
Witness to the blundering of our plans.
I'll return to Oldtown.

01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:08.894
The Hightowers still have strength

01:04:08.894 --> 01:04:14.441
and you have a son there
who will take more kindly to instruction.

01:04:14.441 --> 01:04:17.527
Daeron may yet help us in weeks to come.

01:04:22.365 --> 01:04:24.367
Go rather to Highgarden.

01:04:26.787 --> 01:04:30.290
The Tyrells must be taken in hand.
Their bannermen are wavering.

01:04:31.124 --> 01:04:33.043
While you're gone,
I'll speak sense to him.

01:04:33.585 --> 01:04:35.045
His blood will cool.

01:04:35.837 --> 01:04:37.714
In time, you may yet return.

01:04:51.144 --> 01:04:56.358
The young are peacocks,
all shrieking and feathers.

01:04:58.985 --> 01:05:03.615
But we will yet prevail
and bring forth peace, I still believe it.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.160
As long as you and I hold fast.

01:05:20.173 --> 01:05:22.008
I have sinned.

01:05:25.804 --> 01:05:28.640
I do not wish to hear of it.
