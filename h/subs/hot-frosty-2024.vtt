23:29.458 --> 23:32.750
Probably just some guy who did
a naked mile to impress his buddies.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.166
I mean, we've all been there. Am I right?

23:35.250 --> 23:36.416
-Sure.
-[Ed laughing]

23:36.500 --> 23:37.416
[Nate] Schatz!

23:37.500 --> 23:38.416
I gotta go.

23:39.541 --> 23:40.500
[sighs]

23:40.583 --> 23:42.916
[woman] Welcome, folks.
I'm gonna show you how to make

23:43.000 --> 23:46.541
some easy, creamy, delicious eggnog,
perfect for the holidays.

23:48.458 --> 23:50.125

-[cat wails]

23:50.208 --> 23:52.875
Ah! Ah! [gasps]

23:53.458 --> 23:56.208
[man] Now place the pepperoni
in a circular fashion,

23:56.291 --> 23:57.750
spiraling right around into…

23:57.833 --> 24:02.083
[Bach's "Toccata and Fugue
in D minor" playing]

24:08.458 --> 24:10.125
-[thuds against door]
-Ahh!

24:10.208 --> 24:15.083
[music continues]

24:19.250 --> 24:20.125
[music stops]

24:30.916 --> 24:32.000
Wow.

24:42.208 --> 24:44.916
[sad music playing]

25:05.166 --> 25:06.125
[door opens]

25:06.208 --> 25:07.791
Hello! I'm back.

25:08.375 --> 25:09.208
[door closes]

25:11.000 --> 25:12.041
Hello?

25:12.958 --> 25:13.833
Jack?

25:16.000 --> 25:17.333
Did you steal my TV?

25:22.708 --> 25:23.708
[exhales]

25:23.791 --> 25:24.708
Jack?

25:25.208 --> 25:26.166
Are you here?

25:27.916 --> 25:29.333
-[Kathy screams]
-Ahh!

25:29.416 --> 25:31.500
That was very, very, very scary.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.833
[exclaims]

25:32.916 --> 25:34.916
-You almost gave me a heart attack.
-Sorry.

25:35.541 --> 25:36.416
You okay?

25:36.500 --> 25:39.000
-Sorry. I did not mean to yell like that.
-Sorry.

25:39.083 --> 25:39.916
Okay.

25:40.416 --> 25:41.416
What's in the bag?

25:41.500 --> 25:45.041
I got you some clothes
from, um, Mel and Theo's.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.375
You know, I thought
you could use some clothes.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.208
But you'll have to try 'em on,
'cause I wasn't sure about the size…

25:50.291 --> 25:52.333
-Okay.
-…and, you know, there's different…

25:52.416 --> 25:54.708
Oh, whoa. No, not right now. Like, not…

25:55.416 --> 25:58.625
We don't change in front of people.
We wait until no one's around.

25:58.708 --> 25:59.750
Got it.

25:59.833 --> 26:00.750
Great.

26:00.833 --> 26:03.083
Uh, I actually have something
to show you in the kitchen.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.625
Yeah. No, I just have a question.

26:04.708 --> 26:07.833
The first night, Jack,
were you wearing clothes?

26:07.916 --> 26:10.791
[scoffs] Of course.
I had on this scarf you gave me.

26:10.875 --> 26:14.666
Right. But the coveralls
and the-the boots, did you…

26:14.750 --> 26:16.166
Did you steal 'em?

26:17.250 --> 26:18.250
Okay. Did you…

26:18.875 --> 26:21.208
Did you streak past old Mortimer Jennings?

26:21.291 --> 26:22.166
Streak?

26:22.250 --> 26:25.791
Yeah. You know, did you, like,
run by with no pants on?

26:25.875 --> 26:27.333
[inhales] Yes.

26:27.833 --> 26:29.958
You did? Great. Okay, so we can't do that.

26:30.041 --> 26:30.958
Oh.

26:31.041 --> 26:34.041
Yeah. Okay. So, uh,
the sheriff came to see me today,

26:34.125 --> 26:36.791
and, well, the clothes you stole, he's…

26:37.541 --> 26:38.875
He's looking for you.

26:38.958 --> 26:41.958
Oh, well, that's no problem.
I'll just give them back.

26:42.041 --> 26:44.875
And I'm sure he'd appreciate that,
but that's not what it's about.

26:44.958 --> 26:47.625
Not for him.
We gotta just keep you off his radar.

26:48.416 --> 26:50.833
I'm on his radar?

26:50.916 --> 26:53.708
Yeah, I need you to just lay low.

26:53.791 --> 26:55.250
-Now?
-Yes.

26:56.166 --> 26:57.625
Just lay low…

26:57.708 --> 26:58.791
No, no.

27:00.250 --> 27:02.250
I just mean
don't draw attention to yourself.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.750
That's what "lay low" means.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.083
Okay? And if he doesn't know who you are,

27:06.166 --> 27:07.833
he doesn't know where you are,

27:07.916 --> 27:09.000
then you're safe.

27:09.083 --> 27:10.041
Okay.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.625
Are you mad at me?

27:11.708 --> 27:15.625
No. I'm just, um…
Just trying to keep my story straight.

27:15.708 --> 27:17.458
Okay. Kitchen?

27:17.958 --> 27:18.833
-Yes.
-Okay.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.458
I'm gonna put this in your room.

27:20.541 --> 27:21.458
Okay.

27:22.166 --> 27:23.875
All right. So what's the big…

27:25.291 --> 27:26.333
What's happening?

27:26.416 --> 27:27.958
[laughs] What is this?

27:28.458 --> 27:30.291
I'm making you dinner. Pizza.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.583
I got the recipe off this lady from TV,

27:32.666 --> 27:35.458
except you didn't have pepperoni,
but you did have ham.

27:35.541 --> 27:36.583
I hope that's okay.

27:36.666 --> 27:38.291
How in the world did you do all this?

27:38.375 --> 27:40.083
I'm a fast learner. Oh.

27:42.375 --> 27:43.375
What's that?

27:44.250 --> 27:45.208
Eggnog.

27:45.791 --> 27:48.833
There's a whole show just about
Christmas treats that I watched.

27:48.916 --> 27:51.916
I have no idea what a nog actually is,
but it tastes great.

27:52.000 --> 27:52.875
Mmm!

27:53.875 --> 27:55.083
This is very, um…

27:55.625 --> 27:57.083
[giggles]

27:57.166 --> 27:59.083
It's just… It's very weird.

27:59.166 --> 28:01.625
Oh no. Did I not make the nog right?

28:01.708 --> 28:05.541
No, your nog is… It's a fantastic nog.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.666
But you're standing here in my kitchen,

28:08.750 --> 28:12.125
you could barely function this morning,
and you're making me drinks and dinner,

28:12.208 --> 28:14.666
and, I mean, let's not even
mention the snowman part.

28:14.750 --> 28:17.208
When was the last time
somebody made you dinner?

28:17.708 --> 28:18.875
Isaac at the diner.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.958
He makes me dinner almost every night.

28:21.041 --> 28:24.375
I can't actually remember
the last time I cooked for myself.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.041
Can I ask you a question?

28:26.541 --> 28:27.458
Of course. Yeah.

28:27.541 --> 28:31.875
Okay, so, earlier today,
I was checking the house for vampires.

28:31.958 --> 28:33.000
Okay.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.041
And I went downstairs…

28:37.125 --> 28:38.333
What's cancer?

28:41.791 --> 28:43.416
Jack, it's, um…

28:45.375 --> 28:48.250
It's not a nice thing
that happens to some people.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.791
And that's what happened to Paul?

28:52.416 --> 28:53.291
Yeah.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.375
And it just happened so fast. You know?

28:58.208 --> 29:02.625
Which I'm grateful for,
because he didn't have to suffer, but…

29:04.166 --> 29:07.250
Man, I just…
You just think there's more time.

29:09.208 --> 29:10.416
I'm sorry, Kathy.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.541
And all that stuff down there,
that's all his too?

29:14.625 --> 29:17.666
It is. He, uh, did home repairs.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.750
That must be why
this house is so beautiful.

29:19.833 --> 29:21.916
That's also why it's…

29:22.000 --> 29:23.250
[laughs ruefully]

29:23.333 --> 29:26.041
It's why it's falling apart
since he's been gone, but…

29:27.166 --> 29:29.250
You know, like everything else.

29:30.708 --> 29:33.916
Well, hopefully this pizza
doesn't fall apart,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.250
'cause I worked
really, really, really hard on it.

29:39.666 --> 29:43.541
Do you mind putting it in the oven?
'Cause I turned on the oven earlier today,

29:43.625 --> 29:45.875
and I do not like the oven.

29:46.916 --> 29:47.958
[giggles]

29:51.375 --> 29:54.833
Great. This looks fantastic.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.083
Let me cut you a piece.

29:56.166 --> 29:58.958
No, thanks. I tried a bite
of my practice pizza earlier,

29:59.041 --> 30:02.416
it made my mouth feel like it was melting.
But I did do this.

30:05.125 --> 30:06.666
Not sure how it's going to taste, but…

30:06.750 --> 30:09.083
Cold pizza's delicious.
I had a ton of it in college.

30:11.958 --> 30:14.208
[both laughing awkwardly]

30:16.125 --> 30:17.666
-[tropical music playing]
-Wow.

30:17.750 --> 30:21.166
[woman] Hawaii is a tropical paradise
that offers an unforgettable vacation.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.208
-[Jack] Isn't this so amazing?
-[Kathy chuckles]

30:23.291 --> 30:24.250
So, let's go.

30:25.041 --> 30:26.500
-To Hawaii?
-Yeah.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.166
Okay. Here's the thing.

30:29.250 --> 30:31.916
People who just met
don't really go on vacation together.

30:32.000 --> 30:32.916
Why not?

30:33.583 --> 30:35.541
Well, because they just don't.

30:36.416 --> 30:38.625
And it's really expensive, and…

30:38.708 --> 30:41.166
I mean, you say you're
a snowman, right? Hawaii?

30:41.250 --> 30:44.666
It's, like, really warm.
Super warm, even at Christmastime.

30:44.750 --> 30:45.583
[Jack] Mm…

30:46.541 --> 30:50.666
But I'm sure
you're gonna get there someday, somehow.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.041
You're a fast learner.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.375
-Thanks, Kathy.
-Sure.

30:59.125 --> 30:59.958
Uh…

31:01.625 --> 31:02.666
[awkward grunt]

31:03.208 --> 31:05.875
-Sorry, I'm just not much of a hugger.
-Oh.

31:05.958 --> 31:07.875
Sorry. I… I didn't know.

31:07.958 --> 31:10.708
No. Of course.
You don't have to say sorry. [chuckles]

31:11.291 --> 31:14.625
-Let me pick this up. I'll clean this up.
-No, that's okay. I'll do it.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.750
-Really?
-Yeah. Yeah.

31:18.666 --> 31:20.000
Thanks. Good night.

31:20.083 --> 31:20.958
Night.

31:21.541 --> 31:23.958
Uh, so, what should I do tomorrow?

31:24.041 --> 31:24.916
[Kathy] Uh…

31:25.500 --> 31:28.041
Just watch some TV and…

31:28.125 --> 31:30.833
Honestly, do whatever you want,
but stay in the house and lay low.

31:30.916 --> 31:32.208
-Okay.
-Right?

31:32.291 --> 31:33.791
-Yeah.
-All right. Thanks.

31:33.875 --> 31:34.958
Night.

Ma'am.

32:28.500 --> 32:29.333
Ma'am.

32:30.208 --> 32:31.375
Ma'am, are you all right?

32:31.458 --> 32:33.333
Oh, I think I'll be fine.

32:33.416 --> 32:34.375
Well…

32:35.958 --> 32:38.291
I mean, you're stuck in there pretty bad.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.666
You want me to get behind you and push?

32:41.750 --> 32:43.000
Huh?

32:43.083 --> 32:43.916
Yeah.

Yes.

32:50.750 --> 32:51.625
I'm ready.

-Here I go.
-Okay.

32:53.333 --> 32:54.708
-Yeah.
-How's that?

32:54.791 --> 32:55.625
It's working.

32:55.708 --> 32:57.833
Okay, great. [grunts] Good.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.916
Oh, if the girls could see me now.

33:01.000 --> 33:03.333
[Jack grunts and groans]

33:03.416 --> 33:04.833
All right. Try driving now.

33:04.916 --> 33:06.416
Okay. Yes.

33:06.958 --> 33:07.833
There you go!

33:08.375 --> 33:09.541
Whoo!

33:10.458 --> 33:11.333
Okay.

-[Jack] Whoo!
-Whoo!

33:13.916 --> 33:15.625
-[both laugh]
-Wow.

33:15.708 --> 33:16.791
I am out of breath.

33:16.875 --> 33:18.375
Oh yeah. Me too.

33:18.875 --> 33:23.000
Well, I guess drive safe,
and I'm going to get back to work.

33:23.625 --> 33:25.666
-You're a friend of Kathy's?
-I am. Yeah.

33:25.750 --> 33:28.291
I'm just staying with her
as long as she'll let me.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.166
Wow. Lucky Kathy.

33:30.250 --> 33:31.916
[Jack chuckles]

33:32.000 --> 33:34.750
Listen, how are you with electricity?

33:35.833 --> 33:37.958
Well, if it's on TV, I can learn it.

33:38.041 --> 33:41.083
Oh. I have this new light
that I need installed.

33:41.166 --> 33:42.791
I live close by,

33:42.875 --> 33:46.250
and you seem… very good with your hands.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.708
If you could come by and hang it,

33:49.333 --> 33:50.750
I'd be very grateful.

33:51.250 --> 33:54.125
Oh, well, I'm not really
supposed to leave the house.

33:54.208 --> 33:56.625
I've known Kathy since she was born.

33:56.708 --> 33:59.541
Anyone welcome in her home
is welcome in mine.

34:00.333 --> 34:01.666
Besides,

34:01.750 --> 34:04.875
I'm an older lady
who just had an accident.

34:04.958 --> 34:07.291
You should see to it that I get home safe.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.166
You don't seem that old.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.500
[laughs]

34:10.583 --> 34:12.791
Oh, you are definitely
coming home with me.

Okay, sure. Let me just go put on a shirt.

I haven't been taking care of myself,
my house, my personal life,

45:51.083 --> 45:52.041
since Paul.

45:52.708 --> 45:53.916
And everyone knows it.

45:54.666 --> 45:58.166
Dottie and the staff,
they've been on me about it for months.

45:58.958 --> 46:02.416
Look, even if you were the person I loved…
Which you're not, you're my tenant.

46:02.500 --> 46:03.583
Just so we're clear.

46:04.500 --> 46:08.791
…I am not convinced that I can
really love someone right now, because…

46:11.083 --> 46:14.625
I'm not convinced I have figured out
how to love myself without Paul.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.750
I know, I know it sounds really…

46:19.833 --> 46:22.541
real bad when
I say it like that out loud, but I just…

46:24.583 --> 46:26.291
I haven't found my way forward yet.

46:26.833 --> 46:28.833
[poignant music playing]

46:33.125 --> 46:34.791
You know, I've got to think that

46:35.875 --> 46:39.625
Paul saw the same
amazing person that I see.

46:42.208 --> 46:43.208
[Kathy sobs quietly]

46:43.291 --> 46:47.541
And I've got to think that he wouldn't
want this amazing person to think that

46:49.333 --> 46:51.708
she is anything less than amazing.

46:55.666 --> 46:56.916
[Kathy sighs]

46:58.708 --> 47:01.250
[laughs]

47:04.708 --> 47:06.833
I'm getting grief counseling
from a snowman.

47:06.916 --> 47:09.875
No. You're just talking to a friend.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.250
Or a tenant, sorry.

47:13.125 --> 47:14.041
No.

47:15.833 --> 47:16.666
No.

47:19.583 --> 47:21.250
You were right the first time.

47:24.791 --> 47:26.791
Use your knees, Theo.

47:26.875 --> 47:29.375
[cheerful holiday music playing]

47:33.541 --> 47:35.375
Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

47:35.458 --> 47:36.666
The new glass is here!

47:37.166 --> 47:38.916
Wait. Jack!

47:39.000 --> 47:40.125
Come here.

47:40.208 --> 47:42.583
Did you have something
to do with that glass?

47:42.666 --> 47:46.708
Yeah, so there's this site on the computer

47:46.791 --> 47:49.833
where you can just order
anything you want for people. It's great.

47:50.750 --> 47:52.375
Okay. How did you pay for it?

47:52.458 --> 47:55.250
They didn't ask, so it must have
been some kind of giveaway or something.

47:55.333 --> 47:59.375
I don't know, but it's a good thing,
because that glass was not cheap.

47:59.458 --> 48:02.250
Okay, here's the thing, my computer
has my credit card information,

48:02.333 --> 48:04.166
so when you use my computer…

48:05.583 --> 48:08.041
Oh no.

48:08.125 --> 48:09.833
-Yeah.
-I owe you. I am sorry.

48:09.916 --> 48:13.916
No, it's really okay. It's fine.
Know what? You fixed the roof. We're even.

48:14.000 --> 48:16.333
But that is the only thing
you ordered, right?

48:17.125 --> 48:17.958
Gotta go.

48:18.458 --> 48:20.083
Wait! Remember…

48:20.166 --> 48:22.291
No, I know, I know, I know. Lay low.

48:23.625 --> 48:25.083
I did it.

48:25.166 --> 48:28.458
I broke your window,
and I stole your clothes,

48:28.541 --> 48:31.291
and I was alone,

48:31.375 --> 48:32.541
and I was naked.

48:32.625 --> 48:35.041
[chuckles] I thought that you should know.

48:35.125 --> 48:38.250
So, I'm sorry about the damage.

48:38.333 --> 48:42.000
And I hope that the glass helps.
I'll install that for you and everything.

48:42.083 --> 48:44.208
-You brought us the glass?
-[Jack] I did.

48:44.875 --> 48:46.458
Well, sort of.

48:46.541 --> 48:49.666
I didn't pay for it, but I helped.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.791
Sort of. And I'll return
the clothes tomorrow.

48:52.875 --> 48:54.041
Keep them.

48:54.125 --> 48:55.166
So you're not mad?

48:55.250 --> 48:56.666
[Theo chuckles]

48:56.750 --> 48:58.750
Nobody can be mad at Christmas.

48:58.833 --> 49:01.875
You needed help, you did what you had to,

49:01.958 --> 49:03.750
and now you're making it right.

49:03.833 --> 49:04.750
You okay now?

49:05.333 --> 49:07.041
I am. Kathy's taking care of me.

49:12.125 --> 49:14.041
[Jack] Okay, now let's get up in there.

49:14.541 --> 49:15.958
-Hi, Kathy.
-Hey, Ed.

49:16.041 --> 49:17.000
-Hi.
-Hi.

49:17.083 --> 49:19.791
Listen, I got a police artist
to draw a sketch of the streaker

49:19.875 --> 49:21.583
based on Mortimer's description.

49:23.625 --> 49:24.916
Ethel couldn't describe him?

49:25.000 --> 49:28.958
Oh, she could, but we needed
a description of his face.

49:29.041 --> 49:33.708
Uh, I feel compelled to point out
the resemblance to your friend here.

49:33.791 --> 49:36.833
Eh… I mean, come on, I don't…
Do you not believe me, Ed?

49:36.916 --> 49:39.875
I do, Kathy. I do. I do. Sure.

49:39.958 --> 49:42.166
-But Nate, he's on a tear. You know him.
-Sure.

49:42.833 --> 49:45.625
The sheriff thinking that Jack
had anything to do with this, right?

49:45.708 --> 49:47.666
-[Kathy laughs]
-Well, I mean, I… Yeah.

49:47.750 --> 49:50.625
I… I feel like I have to say, Kathy,

49:50.708 --> 49:52.916
if Jack did do it,
you know, you can tell me that.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.291
You know that's okay, right?

49:54.375 --> 49:56.625
I appreciate that so much.
How does a bowl of soup sound?

49:56.708 --> 49:59.791
How does a bowl of soup sound?
Let's see. Maybe, um…

49:59.875 --> 50:02.875
[popping and percolating]

50:03.583 --> 50:04.958
If it's thick, it might go…

50:05.041 --> 50:06.291
[buoyant popping]

50:06.375 --> 50:08.291
Would you like a bowl of soup, Ed?

50:08.375 --> 50:10.833
Oh! I see what you're getting at. Sure.

50:10.916 --> 50:13.625
Yeah. Nothing too creamy,
I've got a lactose thing.

50:13.708 --> 50:15.916
-Let's see what's on the menu.
-Ooh! Got any chowders?

50:16.000 --> 50:19.375
-Have a bowl of soup.
-I'd arrest a baby for a good beef barley.

50:19.458 --> 50:21.541
[Kathy breathes deeply]

50:25.125 --> 50:26.791
[laughs]

50:27.416 --> 50:29.083
['70s funk plays]

50:30.708 --> 50:32.000
New glass looks good.

50:32.500 --> 50:34.333
Don't worry. We'll find who broke in.

50:34.416 --> 50:36.458
Because you can replace the glass,

50:36.541 --> 50:38.458
but you can't replace the pain.

50:38.541 --> 50:41.875
We did replace the pane.
A whole new pane of glass here.

50:41.958 --> 50:43.375
No, no. Pain.

50:43.958 --> 50:45.708
Like P-A-I-N.

50:46.208 --> 50:47.458
The pain.

50:47.541 --> 50:49.583
Why would I want to replace pain?

50:49.666 --> 50:50.958
It's a metaphor.

50:51.583 --> 50:52.416
For what?

50:53.166 --> 50:54.583
Maybe he means it's a pun.

50:54.666 --> 50:58.375
No. It's not a pun.
It's a metaphor. A metaphor…

50:58.458 --> 51:00.708
I know what I meant.
That's what's important.

51:01.500 --> 51:04.166
You leave the metaphors
around here to me, okay, Mel?

51:04.250 --> 51:06.333
By the way, who did the installation?

51:07.541 --> 51:09.375
Jack. Kathy's friend.

51:10.708 --> 51:12.791
Now, why would he do that, I wonder?

51:13.416 --> 51:16.416
Because he's nice.

51:16.500 --> 51:20.125
Because some people
listen to other people in need

51:20.208 --> 51:22.375
and ask them what they want

51:22.458 --> 51:27.541
instead of using unfortunate situations
to advance their own personal agendas.

51:27.625 --> 51:29.333
Or maybe he's got something to hide.

51:30.791 --> 51:31.791
Boss.

51:31.875 --> 51:32.875
Oh.

51:33.583 --> 51:34.666
Or maybe…

51:36.833 --> 51:38.333
he's got something to hide.

51:38.416 --> 51:39.708
[sighs]

51:52.208 --> 51:55.166
[Kady] Wow. Oh wow.

51:55.250 --> 51:56.416
This looks so good.

51:57.083 --> 51:59.375
Look at the icicles on the ceiling.

51:59.458 --> 52:01.916
Yeah, that was my idea.

52:02.000 --> 52:04.041
[tender music playing]

52:04.125 --> 52:09.916
So, um, I was wondering if anyone has…

52:10.000 --> 52:14.958
Are you going to the dance with somebody?

52:16.083 --> 52:19.416
Oh, great. Wait, no, not great.

52:19.500 --> 52:20.333
[giggles]

52:21.125 --> 52:27.625
Would you maybe
be interested in going with me?

52:28.791 --> 52:30.750
I'd really like that, yeah.

52:30.833 --> 52:33.375
[exhales] Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.

52:33.458 --> 52:36.875
So, wanna walk back to class?

52:36.958 --> 52:38.458
[Kady] I've got to eventually.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.833
Yeah, right, totally.

52:59.750 --> 53:01.833
Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.

53:03.458 --> 53:04.458
Hmm.

53:04.541 --> 53:07.458
-What's all the yarn about?
-It's a tangled web, Ed.

53:07.541 --> 53:09.208
I need to see the bigger picture.

53:09.916 --> 53:12.500
Just wish I had a photo of Jack. Just…

53:12.583 --> 53:14.875
He's in this somehow, I know it.

53:15.750 --> 53:17.916
Hey, guys, good to see you both.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.000
Jack, hey, how you doing?

53:20.083 --> 53:22.791
What? You shouldn't be back here.
This is the inner sanctum.

53:22.875 --> 53:24.458
Cool art project.

53:24.541 --> 53:26.750
You just taking photos
of everybody in town?

53:27.916 --> 53:29.125
I am.

53:29.208 --> 53:31.208
Would you like me to take your picture?

53:31.833 --> 53:33.791
-I would love that.
-[chuckles] Oh!

53:33.875 --> 53:36.375
Where should I stand?
Oh! Oh, oh. Right here.

53:38.166 --> 53:40.250
That is perfect.

53:41.125 --> 53:42.291
[shutter clicks]

53:42.958 --> 53:44.541
-Thank you.
-[Jack] Thank you.

53:45.458 --> 53:49.375
So I actually came here to talk to you
while Kathy was wrapping up at the diner.

53:49.458 --> 53:52.000
-Do you have a minute?
-Uh, yes, I do.

53:52.083 --> 53:53.500
I sure do. Let's go. Yeah.

53:57.208 --> 53:59.208
Got you right where we want you.

53:59.791 --> 54:04.083
[laughs]

54:04.166 --> 54:07.041
-[Ed] Did you say something?
-[gasps] Nope. Nope.

54:07.125 --> 54:10.083
-Who were you talking to?
-Uh, just… Christmas.

54:10.875 --> 54:12.125
[Jack] I need some advice.

54:12.208 --> 54:13.666
I have a date.

54:13.750 --> 54:16.583
Or I want to have a date with Kathy.

54:16.666 --> 54:19.166
And I'm pretty sure
I know how I want to ask her,

54:19.250 --> 54:20.291
but here's the thing…

54:21.083 --> 54:23.958
I've actually never been on a date before.

54:24.041 --> 54:26.500
How have you never been on a date before?

54:26.583 --> 54:28.750
You're like a 10, man.

54:28.833 --> 54:30.000
A… 10?

54:30.083 --> 54:33.583
Like in attractiveness.
Out of 10, you'd be a 10.

54:33.666 --> 54:34.958
Top marks. Way up there.

54:35.041 --> 54:38.916
[embarrassed laugh] Thanks, Schatz.
I mean, you are not so bad yourself.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.166
Oh. [laughs]

54:40.250 --> 54:41.875
Stop. Please.

54:41.958 --> 54:44.833
I am not on your level, okay?

54:44.916 --> 54:46.166
What? Are you kidding me?

54:46.250 --> 54:47.666
With that smile,

54:47.750 --> 54:50.833
and how you have your mustache,
but it's like just the bottom half.

54:50.916 --> 54:52.041
-Confident.
-I worked on that.

54:52.125 --> 54:54.708
-Yeah. Thank you.
-And not to mention your uniform.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.416
Oh, it is a pretty good uniform.

54:56.500 --> 54:58.083
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah, I helped pick it out.

54:58.166 --> 54:59.583
-What? Seriously?
-Yeah.

54:59.666 --> 55:02.666
Oh yeah. These dark brown
pocket lapels? That was me.

55:02.750 --> 55:04.291
Those dark brown pocket lapels

55:04.375 --> 55:06.875
are the perfect thing
to accentuate your lower chest.

55:06.958 --> 55:09.166
That's what I said.
That's the exact thing I said.

55:09.250 --> 55:10.083
[both laugh]

55:10.166 --> 55:12.375
Any girl in town
would be lucky to have you.

55:12.458 --> 55:14.583
And that's why
I need your help with Kathy.

55:14.666 --> 55:17.208
Look, I'm no Don Juan or nothing, okay?

55:17.291 --> 55:18.916
But if you're having fun

55:19.000 --> 55:21.583
and you're paying attention
to make sure she's having fun,

55:22.208 --> 55:23.333
you'll be golden.

55:23.416 --> 55:24.291
Okay.

55:24.375 --> 55:28.250
And, um, what about, uh… kissing?

55:28.833 --> 55:30.458
How do I know she wants to kiss me?

55:30.541 --> 55:33.416
All right, look, it's been
a minute for me too, okay?

55:33.500 --> 55:36.541
I mean, kissing the ladies.
But here's what happens, all right?

55:36.625 --> 55:39.125
She's gonna…
She's gonna lean in a bit, okay?

55:39.875 --> 55:42.000
All right? She's gonna make a face.

55:42.833 --> 55:44.583
-That's the face?
-That's the face.

55:44.666 --> 55:46.875
It's "I want to make out with you" face.
Okay?

55:46.958 --> 55:48.083
And then…

55:48.958 --> 55:52.958
And then you'll know it when you see it.
You'll know exactly when to make the move.

55:53.041 --> 55:55.666
Okay. Yeah. I just…
I just hope I'm good at it.

55:55.750 --> 55:58.208
You're going to be good at it, okay?
You're fine.

55:58.291 --> 56:01.875
Okay. Oh, there was one more thing
I was hoping you could show me.

56:01.958 --> 56:02.833
Anything.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.125
[sighs]

56:13.500 --> 56:15.458
What in the name of God?

56:17.333 --> 56:18.208
[Kathy] Jack?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.875
I have the funniest story to tell you.
Where are you?

56:21.958 --> 56:25.666
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey. How was work?
-You're not gonna believe what happened.

56:25.750 --> 56:27.875
So Mrs. Johnson orders
today's lunch special--

56:27.958 --> 56:30.625
Okay, sorry for interrupting,
but I have to ask you a question,

56:30.708 --> 56:32.708
and I thought I knew
how I was gonna ask it,

56:32.791 --> 56:34.708
but I'm just too nervous,
I'm just gonna say it.

56:34.791 --> 56:39.541
Kathy, will you please go
to the school's Christmas dance with me?

56:40.666 --> 56:44.916
[laughs] Wait, what?
You're-you're going to the dance?

56:45.000 --> 56:46.583
Yeah. I'm a chaperone.

56:46.666 --> 56:48.541
It's, like, my job.

56:48.625 --> 56:50.333
Oh, that's so sweet. I…

56:51.166 --> 56:53.291
-Jack, I…
-Oh.

56:53.916 --> 56:56.541
Of course. You're already
