02:20.006 --> 02:22.338
-Amsterdam, motherfucker.
-Okay.

02:22.508 --> 02:24.271
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

02:24.444 --> 02:26.435
Red-light district. Time for sneepur.

02:26.613 --> 02:29.207
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.646
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

02:34.787 --> 02:36.584
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

02:36.756 --> 02:38.280
I came all the way from Iceland.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.052
-Yeah, what if we did?
-We did that every day in college.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.388
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

02:43.563 --> 02:45.531
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

02:45.698 --> 02:46.960
How about the hemp museum?

02:51.404 --> 02:53.133
Oli proudly presents...

02:55.141 --> 02:56.802
...Isabella.

02:57.977 --> 02:59.239
She's cute.

02:59.412 --> 03:02.779
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.213
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.286
-Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
-Fucking Oli.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.581
The Icelandic--
Oh, God, how are you?

03:10.757 --> 03:14.557
You want to get stoned?

03:15.094 --> 03:17.585
-This will wake you up.
-What the fuck?

03:20.199 --> 03:24.329
This is good Amsterdam shit.

03:27.507 --> 03:29.907
That's the shit right there, dude.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.776
Trust me.

03:36.115 --> 03:37.878
Yeah.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.019
-It's all good, bro.
-Yeah, dude, smoke it!

03:42.155 --> 03:44.589
-Dude, what happened?
-Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

04:00.807 --> 04:02.399
AII right, this is my friend, Josh.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.839
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

04:07.613 --> 04:09.877
-Do you guys want another round?
-Yes, okay.

04:10.049 --> 04:11.516
Yeah?

04:15.388 --> 04:17.618
We will be right back.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.185
-What are you doing?
-What?

04:22.361 --> 04:26.525
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

04:26.699 --> 04:27.723
Wait. There's a guy.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.232
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

04:30.403 --> 04:32.963
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

04:33.139 --> 04:36.131
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.038
-AII right?
-Yeah.

04:38.211 --> 04:39.371
Where's Oli?

04:44.150 --> 04:45.481
He's fucking genius.

04:48.921 --> 04:52.084
Sneepur alert, 3 o’clock.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.489
-She smokes.
-Dude, it's Europe!

04:54.660 --> 04:58.027
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

04:58.197 --> 05:01.166
You are so easy sometimes.

05:01.534 --> 05:05.732
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

05:13.312 --> 05:14.802
I'm sorry.

05:14.981 --> 05:17.211
Yeah, I--
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.476
No, I'm sorry, I--

05:19.652 --> 05:22.382
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.147
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Hey. Hey.

05:24.323 --> 05:26.086
Come on, faggot.

05:28.995 --> 05:32.089
-Fucker!
-Get your fucking hands off me.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.790
-I'm an American, I got rights.
-Get the fuck out.

05:34.967 --> 05:38.266
-Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
-Kiss my American ass, fucker.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.268
-Fuck you.
-Let's get out of here, bro.

05:40.439 --> 05:42.407
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.738
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.312
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

05:48.481 --> 05:49.971
That shit was classic, dude.

05:50.149 --> 05:53.141
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

05:53.319 --> 05:55.685
I'm fucking awesome!

05:56.455 --> 05:57.683
I don't fucking know what--

05:57.857 --> 06:00.690
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

06:00.860 --> 06:02.418
You are fucking Israeli.

06:03.462 --> 06:06.329
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

06:06.499 --> 06:09.525
...because that girl’s a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

06:09.936 --> 06:12.029
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.504
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.475
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

06:19.645 --> 06:23.012
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

06:23.182 --> 06:25.446
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.643
I agree, but I shouldn’t
have to pay for it.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.879
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.306
Hey.

06:58.050 --> 06:59.779
Are you okay?

07:00.987 --> 07:03.751
Hello? Hello?

07:08.895 --> 07:11.921
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.793
Sorry. Jesus.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.130
You're up, slugger.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.599
Man, I'm fucking-- I'm tired, man.
I can, Like, barely stand up.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.764
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.706
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.846
-What do we have in here?
-Hey, you watch, you pay.

07:31.017 --> 07:33.451
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.050
Hey.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.357
Come, sit.

07:49.869 --> 07:52.599
Your friends are so funny.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.137
Yeah.

07:56.075 --> 07:59.670
You can wash over here, by sink.

08:14.593 --> 08:16.151
It was fine.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.557
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

08:19.732 --> 08:21.962
It was fine. It was whatever.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.401
What was that?

08:28.574 --> 08:31.543
-It's fucking after curfew, man.
-Curfew? What are we, 1 3?

08:31.711 --> 08:35.272
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.042
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, Like, lock us out.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.479
This is bullshit.

08:39.652 --> 08:40.880
Hello?

08:41.053 --> 08:42.645
Open the fucking door.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.652
-What did you tell him?
-He just told them to let us in.

08:53.499 --> 08:55.592
-Shut up!
-Jesus.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.532
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.535
Hey, I know what to do.

09:04.677 --> 09:06.110
Shut up.

09:07.446 --> 09:10.006
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

09:10.549 --> 09:12.278
Come on.

09:12.585 --> 09:13.609
Go. Go, go, go.

09:21.293 --> 09:22.783
Oh, don't mind them.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.820
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.695
-Thanks, bro.
-It's no problem.

09:31.871 --> 09:34.863
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.467
Paxton.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.843
Alexei. But call me Alex.

09:43.015 --> 09:47.611
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

09:48.054 --> 09:49.817
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.549
I'm the first in line for sneepur.

09:54.026 --> 09:56.620
Oh, that's Icelandic for ''clit.''

09:58.064 --> 10:00.931
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.158
Women have it.

10:02.334 --> 10:06.361
It's, Like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.736
Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.

10:09.909 --> 10:12.309
-Yeah.
-Come on, guys, have a seat.

10:20.152 --> 10:21.585
Where you travel to?

10:21.754 --> 10:24.917
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

10:25.091 --> 10:26.683
Anyway, we went all over France...

10:26.859 --> 10:29.794
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

10:29.962 --> 10:32.453
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

10:32.631 --> 10:35.657
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

10:35.835 --> 10:39.032
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass senoritas.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.165
Looking for girls?

10:43.275 --> 10:44.503
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:45.744 --> 10:48.110
So talk to Alex.

10:48.581 --> 10:52.176
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

10:52.351 --> 10:53.511
I can help you.

10:54.053 --> 10:57.420
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.715
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

11:00.893 --> 11:02.360
-Yeah.
-Good.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.129
You looking for girls Like this?

11:19.411 --> 11:22.380
These are fucking magnificent.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.417
-Who the hell are these girls?
-You have to go east, my friend.

11:26.585 --> 11:28.644
This is where the best girls are.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.152
The best.

11:30.322 --> 11:32.153
How far east?

11:32.324 --> 11:35.259
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

11:36.262 --> 11:39.390
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

11:39.565 --> 11:41.157
...just outside Bratislava.

11:41.734 --> 11:44.760
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

11:45.671 --> 11:48.572
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.340
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

11:51.510 --> 11:54.673
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

11:54.847 --> 11:55.939
Josh.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.913
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

11:59.652 --> 12:03.247
Barcelona, so many Americans.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.549
But Slovakia? No one there.

12:05.724 --> 12:09.626
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.088
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

12:13.265 --> 12:15.859
They go crazy for any foreigner.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.798
You just...

12:19.205 --> 12:20.934
...take them.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.731
Fuck, man.

12:53.572 --> 12:56.769
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, Like, two seconds?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.739
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

12:58.911 --> 13:00.970
-Okay, all right.
-My Viking balls too.

13:01.146 --> 13:02.579
Okay, stop.

13:14.526 --> 13:16.050
I'm sorry.

13:16.228 --> 13:17.752
My daughter.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.921
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.691
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.564
-Saskia.
-Cute.

13:28.073 --> 13:31.702
-She's adorable.
-She's a little cutie, yeah.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.947
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

13:36.115 --> 13:37.673
-Very pretty.
-She's 6.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.875
She's starting school this year.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.486
Wait, you have a daughter?

13:42.655 --> 13:45.488
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.257
Okay. AII right.

13:49.428 --> 13:52.192
-You are on vacation?
-Yeah, we're backpacking.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.831
Our next stop is Bratislava.

13:56.568 --> 13:59.469
-What?
-Slovakia.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.275
You will Like it.

14:03.542 --> 14:05.874
Casino, girls.

14:08.047 --> 14:11.073
You can pay to do anything.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.013
Anything.

14:14.053 --> 14:17.045
-How are the girls?
-Very beautiful.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.557
They will Love you.
Handsome American Like you.

14:22.728 --> 14:26.220
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

14:27.099 --> 14:30.262
That's-- That's awkward.
That's awkward.

14:38.677 --> 14:40.804
That's awkward too.

14:42.581 --> 14:45.641
-You need a fork there, chief?
-No, no, no.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.343
I prefer to use my hands.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.916
I believe...

14:51.223 --> 14:55.057
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.793
They do not think:

14:57.963 --> 15:01.626
''This is something who gave its Life
so I would not go hungry.''

15:02.368 --> 15:05.701
I Like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.270
I appreciate it more.

15:08.474 --> 15:09.907
Well, I'm vegetarian.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.543
And I am a meat-eater.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.645
It's human nature.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.776
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.481
Tell me, what is your nature?

15:22.321 --> 15:24.755
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

15:25.224 --> 15:26.816
I'm sorry.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.693
Excuse me.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.763
Fucking freak.

15:34.600 --> 15:35.658
Jesus.

15:39.471 --> 15:42.304
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

15:43.909 --> 15:46.207
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.810
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

16:53.979 --> 16:55.674
Or we could visit some factories.

16:57.082 --> 16:58.481
Should be cool.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.481
In this area...

17:00.652 --> 17:05.180
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.487
Is that so?

17:30.916 --> 17:32.645
Look at this.

18:16.328 --> 18:19.627
-Nice, eh?
-This is a fucking hostel?

18:20.766 --> 18:23.030
Holy shit.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.076
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

18:36.214 --> 18:38.079
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.978
-You are saved from boredom.
-Let me guess.

18:42.154 --> 18:45.590
You must be
the King of the Swing.

18:45.757 --> 18:47.987
You made a reservation under
''King of the Swing?''

18:48.160 --> 18:49.923
-Yeah, of course, my horse.
-I'm sorry.

18:50.095 --> 18:53.963
-He doesn't get out of his cage much.
-I can see that.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.432
Here are your keys.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.537
You leave your passports
at the desk.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.470
That was taken when I was Like 1 3.
I was kind of husky.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.012
Not anymore, though, you know?

19:10.182 --> 19:13.151
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

19:13.318 --> 19:17.482
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.557
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

19:28.533 --> 19:29.966
Sorry.

19:30.402 --> 19:33.530
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.640
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

19:39.144 --> 19:40.975
You should come.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.579
Spa.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.365
Jugs.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.405
-Hey.
-Hello.

20:09.574 --> 20:11.565
Oh, Jesus.

20:13.612 --> 20:15.671
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.684
How you doing?

20:23.722 --> 20:26.520
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

20:28.627 --> 20:31.790
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

20:31.963 --> 20:35.023
-You wanna see?
-No, no, no, you're not-- I'm good.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.464
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

20:38.970 --> 20:41.871
-You're not from Iceland, no?
-No. Fuck, no. American.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.736
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

20:45.310 --> 20:47.540
Hygiene and-- Am I talking?

20:47.946 --> 20:50.471
-I'm Josh.
-Natalya.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.909
-And this is Svetlana.
-Hi.

20:53.552 --> 20:55.247
Hi, I'm Paxton.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.416
-And this is Oli.
-The King of the Swing.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.188
Hello.

21:02.527 --> 21:04.688
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

21:04.863 --> 21:06.330
Jesus.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.432
So where are you girls from?

21:08.600 --> 21:10.864
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

21:11.369 --> 21:13.098
Prague.

21:14.072 --> 21:17.064
Prague's cool. Kafka.

21:17.576 --> 21:20.704
So, Natalya....

21:20.879 --> 21:23.507
-Yeah?
-You're Russian, eh?

21:45.036 --> 21:48.699
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.705
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.389
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

22:38.557 --> 22:40.957
...and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

22:41.126 --> 22:45.495
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's-- You know, it's cool.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.097
It's okay.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.789
Look, Vala is here.

22:48.967 --> 22:52.459
-Who?
-Vala, from front desk. Vala.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.536
-AII right, Oli.
-Hey, I told you, man.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.801
I'm the King of the Swing.

22:59.344 --> 23:02.313
Come, Let’s dance.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.055
-Does the cigarette bother you?
-No, it's--

23:13.225 --> 23:14.988
I put away.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.424
It's fine, I....

23:17.596 --> 23:20.497
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

23:20.765 --> 23:23.666
But I'II be back, okay?

23:45.957 --> 23:47.185
Cigarette.

23:48.293 --> 23:49.760
Cigarette.

23:50.295 --> 23:51.489
Aren't you a Little young?

23:51.663 --> 23:53.460
-Dollar.
-What?

23:54.099 --> 23:55.361
Dollar.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.967
-Dollar.
-Here you go.

24:10.782 --> 24:12.716
Here, children commit
the most crime.

24:13.151 --> 24:16.279
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

24:16.855 --> 24:19.483
-You're okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.952
Hey, Let me buy you a drink.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.662
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:27.265 --> 24:29.199
Hey, Josh.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.834
Faggot.

24:31.169 --> 24:33.637
Go with your friends. It's okay.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.636
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

24:35.807 --> 24:37.832
About the way I reacted.

24:38.343 --> 24:40.004
We cool?

24:44.816 --> 24:48.047
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

24:50.255 --> 24:52.314
It's not easy...

24:52.924 --> 24:55.154
...but from my experience...

24:55.327 --> 24:58.660
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

25:01.032 --> 25:02.363
Now I have my Little girl...

25:02.534 --> 25:06.300
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

25:07.138 --> 25:10.130
But you should do...

25:10.308 --> 25:12.674
...whatever's right for you.

25:14.846 --> 25:17.906
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

25:33.665 --> 25:35.496
Should we be doing this
with them there?

25:35.667 --> 25:37.464
Yeah, it's okay.

25:39.037 --> 25:43.201
-Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
-Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

25:43.375 --> 25:45.843
-AII right.
-Come on, big boy.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.411
-We go to spa.
-Spa.

25:48.580 --> 25:51.242
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

25:51.416 --> 25:52.974
Bye.

27:18.703 --> 27:20.466
Mission accomplished.

27:23.708 --> 27:27.576
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

27:27.745 --> 27:30.475
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

27:31.182 --> 27:32.774
Be quiet.

27:36.621 --> 27:38.885
They're showering together.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.158
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

27:46.064 --> 27:47.929
I guess Oli’s not back yet.

27:48.099 --> 27:50.863
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

27:51.035 --> 27:52.559
We’ll see him at breakfast.

28:06.384 --> 28:10.582
-What's the name?
-Oli Ericson, 23 7.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.119
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

28:16.294 --> 28:17.420
Fucking gay.

28:17.595 --> 28:19.620
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

28:20.298 --> 28:22.198
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

28:22.367 --> 28:24.733
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

28:25.670 --> 28:27.900
-When this morning?
-I don't know exact time.

28:28.072 --> 28:30.233
I could find out tomorrow.

28:36.548 --> 28:39.449
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

28:39.617 --> 28:41.551
Can I Leave a note
in case he comes back?

28:41.719 --> 28:43.744
Okay, cool. Yeah.

28:46.991 --> 28:48.549
AII right.

28:52.830 --> 28:56.095
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

28:56.267 --> 28:58.064
Okay.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.794
-We see you later, right?
-Yeah.

29:00.471 --> 29:02.063
Okay.

29:03.141 --> 29:04.369
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

29:04.542 --> 29:09.206
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

29:09.380 --> 29:11.041
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

29:11.216 --> 29:14.413
-Hi! Hi! Hi!
-Hi.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.281
Your friend.

29:17.555 --> 29:20.615
-What the hell?
-Your friend, my friend.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.657
What does that say?

29:23.695 --> 29:25.356
Sayonara. Your friend.

29:25.530 --> 29:27.157
What, they left? Like, together?

29:27.332 --> 29:30.233
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even Like Asian girls.

29:30.401 --> 29:31.993
I mean, no offense, but--

29:32.170 --> 29:33.694
When did she send this to you?

29:33.871 --> 29:35.998
This picture. Today?

29:36.541 --> 29:39.476
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

29:39.644 --> 29:40.633
This picture.

29:43.014 --> 29:44.379
That water looks fucking cold.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.074
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

29:47.252 --> 29:49.686
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

29:50.355 --> 29:52.653
-Where?
-Lake Michigan.

29:52.824 --> 29:57.761
It was fucked up, man.
This Little girl, probably 4 or 5.

29:58.129 --> 30:01.587
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

30:01.766 --> 30:04.360
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

30:04.535 --> 30:05.900
Yeah? What did you do?

30:06.070 --> 30:09.904
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

30:10.074 --> 30:12.634
...and I yelled, you know,
''There's this girl drowning.''

30:12.810 --> 30:15.677
And she couldn’t see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

30:15.847 --> 30:19.874
And then a second Later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

30:20.351 --> 30:22.649
It was that Little girl’s mother, dude.

30:23.354 --> 30:24.753
Her kid was dead.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.987
-Jesus.
-I had nightmares for years after that.

30:28.159 --> 30:31.890
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

30:32.063 --> 30:33.655
I just....

30:33.831 --> 30:35.628
I just felt Like I could have
done more.

30:35.800 --> 30:38.394
You did the right thing.
Could’ve been a double drowning.

30:38.569 --> 30:40.799
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

30:40.972 --> 30:44.601
AII I knew was this Little girl was dead
and her mother's Life was ruined.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.937
What makes you think of this now?

30:51.115 --> 30:52.173
Bubble gum.

30:53.384 --> 30:56.114
-Sorry, kid.
-No, no. Give him some.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.622
What are you doing?

31:02.727 --> 31:05.287
These fucking kids are dangerous.

31:06.064 --> 31:07.531
Hey, Oli.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.894
-Hey, Oli.
-Hey.

31:12.537 --> 31:14.437
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:14.605 --> 31:17.904
-Hey, Oli. Hey!
-Oli!

31:22.914 --> 31:24.711
It's your lucky day, Josh.

31:24.882 --> 31:26.509
A museum.

32:12.296 --> 32:13.627
How's it hanging?

32:15.767 --> 32:18.531
-What the fuck?
-Holy shit.

32:18.703 --> 32:20.671
-He got you.
-Yeah, that's hilarious.

32:20.838 --> 32:22.066
Okay.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.332
Hey, Oli.

32:26.043 --> 32:27.738
Hey, Oli.

32:27.912 --> 32:29.209
Hey, hey.

32:31.115 --> 32:32.412
Excuse me?

32:33.217 --> 32:36.345
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.149
Well, I'm not.

32:39.323 --> 32:40.915
Where did you get that jacket?

32:43.327 --> 32:46.854
-Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

32:48.099 --> 32:51.159
This is my jacket.

33:07.251 --> 33:08.912
It's from Oli.

33:10.388 --> 33:11.377
''I go home''?

34:10.114 --> 34:12.708
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

34:13.918 --> 34:16.351
Hey, Kana, when are you Leaving?

34:17.655 --> 34:20.954
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

34:21.559 --> 34:23.686
Tomorrow, I go.

34:23.860 --> 34:25.226
Okay, because we may go too.

34:25.396 --> 34:29.196
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

34:30.935 --> 34:32.902
Tomorrow, train?

34:33.070 --> 34:34.731
Yeah, yeah.

34:37.475 --> 34:39.375
-Hello, Josh.
-Hey.

34:39.543 --> 34:41.478
-Hey.
-Come, we go for disco?

34:41.646 --> 34:45.342
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

34:47.752 --> 34:50.482
Okay, we’ll see you.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.957
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We’ll be right out.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.758
Okay.

35:04.201 --> 35:06.726
-Josh, come here, dude.
-Yeah, what?

35:07.238 --> 35:10.469
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting Like it is.

35:10.641 --> 35:12.768
-I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
-I'm pissed too.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.434
But we're not in America.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.547
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.642
It's just how they do it over here.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.718
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

35:22.887 --> 35:24.787
He could’ve gone
somewhere with that girl.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.982
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

35:28.159 --> 35:29.490
So Let’s Look at our options.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.925
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

35:33.097 --> 35:36.430
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

35:36.601 --> 35:40.401
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

35:40.571 --> 35:42.664
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

35:42.840 --> 35:45.900
Okay. AII right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.409
-It's his problem.
-AII right.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.706
AII right.

35:50.881 --> 35:54.180
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

35:54.585 --> 35:56.109
You know, disco?
Dancing?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.621
No?

36:39.563 --> 36:41.656
Josh?

36:41.832 --> 36:44.596
-I'm gonna go back.
-Are you okay?

36:44.769 --> 36:46.100
I'm, Like-- I'm tired.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.830
Actually, I have, Like, a headache.

36:49.674 --> 36:51.767
If you want, I will go with you.

36:52.376 --> 36:56.437
No, no, no, I'II just see you
back at the room.

36:58.482 --> 37:00.609
Goodbye.

37:05.656 --> 37:06.748
Fucking pussy.

37:39.256 --> 37:40.780
-Josh.
-Vala.

37:40.958 --> 37:42.789
You don't Look well.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.190
-No, I--
-Here, Let me help you.

37:45.362 --> 37:48.422
I feel sick.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.810
Where is...?
Where is Oli?

38:01.979 --> 38:04.004
You need rest.

38:31.609 --> 38:33.702
Where's the restroom?

38:34.345 --> 38:36.779
Past the bar, in the back.

38:43.788 --> 38:44.846
You guys cool?

38:45.589 --> 38:47.955
-Vodka Red Bull.
-Vodka Red Bull, danke.

38:52.830 --> 38:54.297

Hey!

41:17.408 --> 41:19.603
Please, please--
Fuck. Please, please, please--

41:19.777 --> 41:22.007
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

41:24.114 --> 41:26.014
Please, please, what the--?

41:26.183 --> 41:29.619
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

41:29.787 --> 41:30.947
What the fuck?

41:31.555 --> 41:33.785
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

41:34.858 --> 41:36.450
What the fuck?

41:36.627 --> 41:40.654
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.321
What the fuck is this?

41:42.499 --> 41:44.330
What? No! No, please don't--!

41:44.501 --> 41:46.628
What the--?
No, no, fucking don't you-- No, no!

41:47.004 --> 41:49.472
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God!

41:49.640 --> 41:51.608
Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

41:51.775 --> 41:54.039
Oh, please. What the fuck?

41:54.211 --> 41:56.611
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

42:05.322 --> 42:08.553
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

42:41.125 --> 42:42.353
You.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.628
Why?

42:52.803 --> 42:56.671
I always wanted to be a surgeon...

42:57.274 --> 43:00.072
...but the boards wouldn’t pass me.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.542
Can you guess why?

43:13.290 --> 43:14.780
You see?

43:16.427 --> 43:18.657
So I went into business...

43:18.829 --> 43:21.491
...but business is so boring.

43:22.232 --> 43:26.259
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

43:26.437 --> 43:28.166
What kind of Life is that?

43:28.872 --> 43:31.136
A surgeon...

43:31.308 --> 43:35.039
...he holds the very essence
of Life in his hands.

43:35.379 --> 43:36.937
Your Life.

43:37.114 --> 43:39.582
He touches it.

43:41.085 --> 43:43.576
He has a relationship with it.

43:43.954 --> 43:46.445
He's part of it.

43:49.059 --> 43:51.857
Please, please.
Just Let me go, please.

43:52.029 --> 43:54.589
You want to go?

43:55.099 --> 43:57.590
Is that what you want?

44:16.653 --> 44:19.087
Oh, my God!

44:25.162 --> 44:27.596
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

44:38.342 --> 44:40.333
You are free to go.

45:05.102 --> 45:08.594
Oh, fuck. No!

45:08.772 --> 45:11.832
No. No, fuck. No, fuck--

45:12.876 --> 45:15.538
Please, I have money.
I'II fucking pay you.

45:15.712 --> 45:17.577
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want--

45:17.748 --> 45:19.147
-Pay me?
-Yes.

45:19.316 --> 45:20.806
No one is paying me.

45:20.984 --> 45:24.545
In fact, I am the one paying them.

45:35.132 --> 45:37.965
Relax. Relax, bro.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.869
Oh, shit.

45:55.919 --> 45:58.149
-Two thirty-seven, please.
-Two three seven.

45:58.755 --> 45:59.983
Didn't you check out?

46:01.291 --> 46:02.553
No, not yet.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.450
Not yet.

46:04.628 --> 46:08.325
-This your bag?
-Yeah.

46:08.498 --> 46:11.092
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

46:11.401 --> 46:12.993
-I didn't check out.
-It says.

46:13.170 --> 46:14.831
It happened this morning.

46:15.005 --> 46:17.132
This is bullshit.
Did somebody Leave a note?

46:17.307 --> 46:19.366
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

46:19.876 --> 46:23.107
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake--

46:23.280 --> 46:25.840
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

46:26.016 --> 46:29.383
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

46:30.954 --> 46:32.581
Two three seven.

46:35.892 --> 46:39.384
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

46:39.563 --> 46:42.657
No, think they Left this morning.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.323
Yeah.

46:47.137 --> 46:48.900
I'm sorry, dude.

46:56.647 --> 46:59.047
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

47:00.217 --> 47:03.118
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

47:03.287 --> 47:05.278
You will join us?

47:10.093 --> 47:12.061
You should come.

47:18.702 --> 47:20.727
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

47:20.904 --> 47:23.134
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

47:23.307 --> 47:24.934
I'm at the hostel.

47:27.978 --> 47:29.468
Svetlana!

47:31.348 --> 47:33.282
Svetlana!

48:03.980 --> 48:05.208
Hey!

48:11.355 --> 48:12.549
You Little fucker.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.105
Jesus.

48:31.274 --> 48:33.003
Wait at hostel for your friends.

48:33.176 --> 48:35.667
They will Look for you there
no matter what.

48:35.846 --> 48:40.112
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who--

48:40.283 --> 48:44.083
He just wouldn’t check out without
so much as Leaving a note, you know.

48:44.955 --> 48:46.855
He's the responsible one.

48:47.023 --> 48:50.015
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

48:50.193 --> 48:52.218
...so he take them when he go out.

48:52.396 --> 48:54.921
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

48:55.565 --> 48:56.998
It is not uncommon.

48:59.803 --> 49:02.328
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

49:03.673 --> 49:06.301
There's nothing right now.

49:06.710 --> 49:07.938
We have his picture...

49:08.111 --> 49:11.342
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

49:11.515 --> 49:14.279
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

49:14.451 --> 49:15.918
Okay.

49:17.921 --> 49:19.388
Where are you from?

49:20.290 --> 49:21.552
California.

49:23.493 --> 49:26.155
You are so far from home.

50:49.679 --> 50:52.671
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

50:55.819 --> 50:58.583
Hello, Mr. American.

51:00.824 --> 51:03.224
-Did you get my messages?
-Which one?

51:03.660 --> 51:04.922
There are so many.

51:05.095 --> 51:07.791
I call you back, but child answer.

51:08.298 --> 51:09.731
Yeah, I know.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.458
Have you seen Josh?

51:16.439 --> 51:18.134

51:19.276 --> 51:21.005
He is with your friend...

51:21.177 --> 51:23.042

51:23.647 --> 51:26.639
-He's with Oli.
-Why you Leave last night?

51:27.183 --> 51:31.085
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got Locked in a storage room.

51:31.254 --> 51:34.587
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

51:37.961 --> 51:40.896
-What?
-She said you met another girl.

51:41.064 --> 51:42.929
Where are my friends?

51:48.939 --> 51:50.964
The art show.

51:52.175 --> 51:54.735
-You mean Like a museum?
-No, no, no.

51:55.579 --> 52:01.211
Not museum.
They went-- How you say, for artist?

52:01.384 --> 52:04.410
-Exhibit.
-Exhibit for artist.

52:04.588 --> 52:06.078
No, that doesn't make any sense.

52:06.256 --> 52:07.917
Why? What is wrong?

52:08.091 --> 52:11.185
Well, they didn't Leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

52:11.461 --> 52:12.826
They tell us to tell you.

52:12.996 --> 52:14.964
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

52:15.131 --> 52:18.225
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have--

52:18.401 --> 52:20.426

52:20.604 --> 52:23.573

What the fuck?

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.435
What do you think?

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.897
How do I Look?

01:13:32.074 --> 01:13:35.134
I feel Like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:39.144
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

01:13:41.783 --> 01:13:44.775
Yeah. I'II tell you something....

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:48.912
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Wait a sec.

01:13:50.225 --> 01:13:52.022
How was it?

01:13:56.465 --> 01:13:57.864
Good.

01:13:58.033 --> 01:14:01.366
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:03.834
What did you go for, a local?

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.234
What, European?

01:14:07.075 --> 01:14:08.838
-American.
-An Amer--?

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:12.547
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.

I just fucking Love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.742
They told me they lined up
something special.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.013
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

01:14:20.188 --> 01:14:21.951
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:24.354
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

01:14:24.526 --> 01:14:29.190
It's Like-- They told me
it's Like a real fucking rush, right?

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:30.888
Come here.

pussy's pussy.

01:14:38.206 --> 01:14:41.972
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every....

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.805
It's all the same shit.

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:48.006
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the color of her tits.

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:53.913
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.680
Right?

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:00.324
-Never.
-Never, right.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:03.991

Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:20.642
How'd you do it?

01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:23.514
Did you do it real slow...

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:26.747
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:28.685
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.950
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

01:15:31.126 --> 01:15:32.718

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:30.342
Hey, buddy.

Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:37.415
What are you, fucking deaf?

01:17:46.294 --> 01:17:47.591
Kana.

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:58.263
-Oh, my God.
-What do you want me to do, Kana?

01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:05.472
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

01:18:11.653 --> 01:18:17.853
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:22.326
-Fuck. Oh, God. God.
-No. No!

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.498
-Shit.
-No!

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:28.033
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:46.784
Fuck!

01:18:46.955 --> 01:18:48.388
Fuck!

01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.889
Fuck!

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.536
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

01:20:36.598 --> 01:20:39.158
Move this fucking truck!

01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:43.451
Fuck.

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:57.694
We're almost there.

01:23:03.111 --> 01:23:04.339
Oh, my God.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.011
Oh, no.

01:23:13.555 --> 01:23:14.783
Fuck.

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:49.572
Kana.

01:24:51.085 --> 01:24:52.882
Kana.

01:25:02.463 --> 01:25:04.431
Come here.

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:16.341
No. No, Kana. Kana.

01:25:20.682 --> 01:25:22.206
No, Kana.

01:26:17.338 --> 01:26:21.468
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:25.301
I believe people have Lost
their relationship with food.

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:26.504
They do not think:

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:29.946
''This is something who gave its Life
so I would not go hungry.''

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:34.714
I Like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

01:28:20.027 --> 01:28:21.995
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:34.965
Goddamn!

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.077
Fucker.

01:29:07.809 --> 01:29:09.174
No, please!

01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.245
I get a Lot of money for you...

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:09.542
...and that make you my bitch.
