# I see trees of green #

00:44.077 --> 00:47.444
# Red roses too #

00:47.480 --> 00:50.779
# I see them bloom #

00:50.817 --> 00:53.183
# For me and you #

00:53.219 --> 00:58.452
# And I think to myself #

00:58.491 --> 01:02.257
# What a wonderful world #

01:06.432 --> 01:10.698
# I see skies of blue #

01:10.737 --> 01:13.399
# And clouds of white #

01:14.407 --> 01:17.672
# The bright blessed day #

01:17.710 --> 01:20.235
# The dark sacred night #

01:20.280 --> 01:25.343
# And I think to myself #

01:25.385 --> 01:29.822
# What a wonderful world #

01:31.958 --> 01:34.188
# Yes #

01:34.227 --> 01:38.095
# I think to myself #

01:39.599 --> 01:41.533
# What a wonderful #

01:45.238 --> 01:46.830
Yes, dude!

01:46.873 --> 01:49.569
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What are you doing?

01:49.609 --> 01:52.442
I'm taking the most incredible dump
of all time, man.

01:52.478 --> 01:54.105
You couldn't wait
till I got out of the shower?

01:54.147 --> 01:58.049
May I remind you that
we both just ate 30 burgers...

01:58.084 --> 02:00.279
and four large orders of fries?

02:02.188 --> 02:04.622
Don't worry, in a little bit,
I'm sure it'll hit you too.

02:04.657 --> 02:07.888
It may be. But I'm gonna wait
till you get out of the shower.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.987
Well, don't wait too long. We've got
to leave for the airport in an hour.

02:11.030 --> 02:12.019
Ooh, that burns.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.091
- An hour?
- Hey, and, Roldy?

02:15.835 --> 02:17.530
Yeah?

02:17.570 --> 02:19.299
Nice pubes.

02:19.839 --> 02:21.898
Asshole, get out of here right now.

02:21.941 --> 02:25.638
- Wipe and leave. Wipe and leave now!
- Dude, this thing is huge!

02:25.678 --> 02:27.737
I think it still has cheese on it.

02:34.754 --> 02:37.917

# I'm hangin' with the ballers,

02:45.898 --> 02:48.025
# I can tell you what they say, haters,

# They say ooh wee #

# I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm way too fuckin' cold #

03:08.421 --> 03:10.981
# Let me tell you what they say

# Aiyo, aiyo #

03:31.944 --> 03:33.912
# My game's here to party
just to cut up a rug #

03:33.946 --> 03:35.379
# Don't make me have to cut up a thug #

03:35.415 --> 03:38.384
# Now play something for me, DJ,
'cause there's nothin' but love #

03:38.418 --> 03:40.943
# Hosted by the ladies
who lookin' for somethin' to rub #

03:52.465 --> 03:55.229
# Ooh wee #

03:55.568 --> 03:57.763
Dude. Oh, my Go...
I just realized something.

03:57.804 --> 03:58.793
What?

03:58.838 --> 04:01.602
Maria's gonna think I'm a stalker, man.
I'm following her to Amsterdam.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.906
Dude, relax. I have a med school
interview in ten minutes.

04:04.944 --> 04:06.707
You don't see me freaking out.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.976
Don't worry, man,
she'll be psyched to see you.

04:09.015 --> 04:10.642
Oh, psyched? You think
she's gonna be psyched?

04:10.683 --> 04:12.810
Totes, dude. Why wouldn't she be?

04:12.885 --> 04:14.152
So how does this work?

04:14.187 --> 04:17.519
We just... we show up in Amsterdam
and we start calling hotels...

04:17.557 --> 04:19.457
and ask if they have
a Maria staying there?

04:19.492 --> 04:21.983
- I don't even know her last name.
- Dude, it's totally cool.

04:22.028 --> 04:23.859
We're definitely gonna find her.

04:23.896 --> 04:25.693
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be...

04:25.732 --> 04:28.496
Sir, I need you to step aside, please.
Let me search you.

04:28.534 --> 04:30.331
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.

04:30.370 --> 04:31.462
Just a random security check.

04:31.504 --> 04:33.972
If you could just step aside, please?
Just over here.

04:34.006 --> 04:36.497
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.170
So this has nothing to do
with my ethnicity?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.839
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.041
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

04:43.082 --> 04:45.983
to search for all possible weapons
or illegal drugs.

04:46.018 --> 04:48.919
So just because of the color of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.547
- No, he's...
- What are you, a racist?

04:50.590 --> 04:53.718
Racist? Dude, I'm black.

04:53.760 --> 04:56.228
He's black. He's not a racist.

04:56.763 --> 04:58.924
Please, dude, you're barely even brown.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.830
No, he didn't mean that.

05:00.867 --> 05:02.596
Compared to me,
you look like Matthew Perry.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.603
Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.606
I'm calling you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!

05:07.640 --> 05:09.631
No, there's nobody here
who is Matthew Perry. No one!

05:09.675 --> 05:11.199
What is going on here?

05:11.244 --> 05:14.736
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks
that I have illegal narcotics on me...

05:14.781 --> 05:16.180
because I'm a minority.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.115
This is textbook racial profiling...

05:18.151 --> 05:20.142
and I'd be more than happy
to call the ACLU or the government...

05:20.186 --> 05:22.654
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

05:22.688 --> 05:25.555
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.255
Hey, what are you doing?

05:28.294 --> 05:30.262
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He called me Matthew Perry.

05:30.296 --> 05:31.593
Well, you look like Matthew Perry.

05:31.631 --> 05:33.462
- He's white!
- So what?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.831
Why does everything have to become
a huge argument with you, man?

05:35.868 --> 05:37.301
'Cause this is America, dude...

05:37.336 --> 05:40.066
and as long as I have my freedom
of speech, no one's gonna shut me up.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.630
Kumar?

05:44.644 --> 05:45.804
Roldy?

05:45.845 --> 05:48.905
- Vanessa.
- Oh, my God!

05:48.948 --> 05:52.315
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. I...

05:52.351 --> 05:54.478
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

05:54.520 --> 05:55.612
Hey.

05:55.655 --> 05:59.091
God, it's been forever.
What are you guys doing?

05:59.125 --> 06:01.593
We're actually on our way
to Amsterdam.

06:01.627 --> 06:02.821
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.591
Well, you guys haven't changed.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.690
You have. You look amazing.
Your hair is diff...

06:07.733 --> 06:10.668
- Doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.796
Yeah, you look great.
You look awesome. Sorry.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.831
What am I even saying?
You look different and...

06:15.875 --> 06:19.470
- Kumar Patel, you're flustered.
- Little bit.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.808
So, what's up with you? You still dating
the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?

06:25.852 --> 06:27.979
Actually, it's Brooks Brothers.

06:28.020 --> 06:30.989
Colton! How are you, buddy?

06:31.023 --> 06:32.615
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.421
And we're not dating anymore.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.826
No. We... are getting married.

06:37.763 --> 06:39.697
Congratulations, you guys.

06:39.732 --> 06:42.257
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.236
- When?
- Next week.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.940
It's going to be a perfect day.

06:47.974 --> 06:50.408
I mean, that's assuming we get
those Stargazer lilies for the bouquets.

06:50.443 --> 06:52.434
This florist has been
a complete nightmare.

06:52.478 --> 06:54.378
Fucking assholes.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.177
Colton's practically planning
the whole wedding all by himself.

06:57.216 --> 07:00.481
So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you
off the leash for a little vay-cay?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.546
I own that place now, Colton.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.386
Thank you so much for the hook-up.

07:05.424 --> 07:08.791
Hey, I ran into Todd,
at Whitaker's, of course.

07:08.828 --> 07:11.296
He told me you got a job
working for the government.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.764
Yeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad
were in the same fraternity.

07:13.799 --> 07:15.130
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh, Jesus.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.158
Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that
appointment at the Defense Department...

07:17.203 --> 07:19.296
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.

07:19.338 --> 07:20.498
The President's supposed to be
at our wedding...

07:20.540 --> 07:22.633
- but you know how busy he is.
- Yeah.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.472
Sounds like an incredible job, man.

07:24.510 --> 07:26.978
Hey, you really got
some major connections to the top.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.481
If you ever need anything, I'm your man.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.745
- Thank you so much, buddy.
- Anytime.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.513
This guy's the best.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.113
- So, sweetheart, we should get going.
- Yes.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.817
- Good to see you guys again.
- Congratulations again.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.224
- Thank you. Take care, thank you.
- It's so nice.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.750
- Bye.
- Bye.

07:56.876 --> 07:58.343
Dude, I can't believe
they're getting married.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.368
We've only been broken up two years.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.912
Plus that dude has date-rape face.

08:02.949 --> 08:05.042
I don't even know what that is.

08:05.084 --> 08:07.575
One who possesses
the face of a date rapist.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.919
Right. Listen...

08:10.957 --> 08:13.425
I'm sorry, bro.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.087
But we are going to Amsterdam.
Come on.

08:16.128 --> 08:19.291
This is true. This is true, Roldy.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.459
# Ooh wee #

08:25.104 --> 08:28.437
- Man, this is so not like me.
- Yeah.

08:28.474 --> 08:31.966
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
Better, faster, stronger.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.672
Nice.

08:33.712 --> 08:34.770
Man, I've never used a sick day before.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.010
I'm taking a whole week off
from work here, man.

08:38.049 --> 08:41.816
And in less than eight hours,
we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.345
- This is nuts. This is nuts.
- I know, dude.

08:44.390 --> 08:46.381
<i>It's gonna be exactly like Euro Trip,
only it's not gonna suck.</i>

08:46.425 --> 08:49.986
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.

09:29.368 --> 09:32.735
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me
such a boner, it's awesome.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.706
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.243
She's all yours, buddy.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.177
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.907
No, that's...

09:41.947 --> 09:43.608
Enjoy.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.256
Just a minute.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.762
Fuc...

09:57.797 --> 09:59.389
Hey, hey.

10:00.232 --> 10:01.426
Let me in.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.731
What are you doing?
I'm taking a piss, asshole!

10:05.771 --> 10:06.897
- Yeah.
- Yo!

10:06.939 --> 10:09.407
I'm not joining
the mile-high club with you.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.433
What about the really high club?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.773
- Are you retarded?
- No.

10:14.814 --> 10:16.714
You brought weed
on the fucking airplane?

10:16.749 --> 10:18.979
- Yep.
- What the fuck?

10:19.018 --> 10:20.986
Wait a second. You were giving
that security guard shit.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.011
Yeah. How else was I
supposed to get past him?

10:23.055 --> 10:25.819
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?

10:26.826 --> 10:29.727
- Look... What are you doing? What is this?
- You'll see.

10:38.270 --> 10:43.469
Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you
to an invention of mine.

10:43.509 --> 10:45.636
Meet the smokeless bong.

10:45.678 --> 10:48.579
- You made this?
- You know, I did.

10:48.614 --> 10:49.740
When you were slaving away at work...

10:49.782 --> 10:52.410
I was actually being
a productive member of society.

10:52.451 --> 10:56.615
- Yeah, that's really productive.
- Let me show you how it works.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.215
So you take a little weed...

11:00.226 --> 11:03.161
put it in the bowl right here and
light it just like a normal bong, OK?

11:03.195 --> 11:05.026
Now here's the truly genius part.

11:05.064 --> 11:10.661
Inside this mechanism, I have
actually made a little tiny, tiny fan...

11:10.703 --> 11:13.433
and some disinfectant powder, OK,
it works sort of like a deodorizer...

11:13.472 --> 11:16.270
so that anything it expunges
smells like Lysol.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.935
- Put it away.
- No, dude.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.968
Can you not wait
till we get to Amsterdam?

11:20.012 --> 11:22.674
It's the weed capital of the world!

11:24.150 --> 11:25.742
- No.
- Put the bong away!

11:25.785 --> 11:27.616
- Take the inaugural hit, dude.
- No!

11:27.653 --> 11:28.745
Come on, man.

11:28.788 --> 11:31.985
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.830
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb...

11:45.738 --> 11:48.138
Terrorist!

11:49.909 --> 11:51.171
Roldy?

11:51.210 --> 11:53.542
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

11:53.579 --> 11:56.446
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.

11:56.482 --> 11:58.950
He said he got a bomb!

12:00.853 --> 12:03.879
No, people,
it's a water pipe for tobacco.

12:03.923 --> 12:06.289
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.325
Poison gas!

12:22.675 --> 12:25.735
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

12:25.778 --> 12:28.975
You picked the wrong plane,
you terrorist fuck!

12:29.014 --> 12:30.982
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

12:32.518 --> 12:35.419
There are three air marshals
on board. Three!

12:35.454 --> 12:39.049
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.888
Shut up!

12:41.894 --> 12:43.088
I got this one!

12:43.128 --> 12:44.459
- Roldy?
- Please don't!

12:44.496 --> 12:47.431
I am in a great amount of pain!

12:47.466 --> 12:51.664
Everybody relax. Just calm down.
Everything is under control.

12:51.704 --> 12:55.970
Tell 'em to turn the plane around. These
two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.

13:19.899 --> 13:23.494
Secretary Fox. Glad you could make it.

13:23.535 --> 13:26.527
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack
of this magnitude?

13:26.572 --> 13:28.802
Not a fuckin' chance.

13:32.912 --> 13:34.937
Who are these people?

13:34.980 --> 13:38.279
Representatives
of the different intelligence agencies.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.808
I assume
Secretary Whitmore's coming?

13:40.853 --> 13:45.552
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip
in Glacier Bay.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.183
I'm in charge while he's gone.

13:47.226 --> 13:49.660
Well, shouldn't he be alerted?

13:49.695 --> 13:54.997
Isn't this issue of more importance
than an ice fishing trip?

14:00.239 --> 14:02.264
Who are you again?

14:02.308 --> 14:04.503
Dr. John Beecher,
Vice Chairman of the NSA.

14:04.543 --> 14:07.910
Yeah, well, listen, Dr... Dipshit.

14:08.714 --> 14:11.274
You've obviously
never been ice fishing before.

14:12.718 --> 14:16.916
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating.

14:16.956 --> 14:20.653
The last thing anyone would want
while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.490
Now back off...

14:23.495 --> 14:25.861
and let me do my job.

14:38.277 --> 14:40.268
What's up with the guy
with the weird eyes?

14:40.312 --> 14:42.906
He handicapped or something?

14:42.948 --> 14:44.939
We believe he's of Korean descent.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.419
My God.

14:52.057 --> 14:55.549
North Korea and al-Qaeda
workin' together.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.357
This is bigger than I thought.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.898
You couldn't wait?

14:59.932 --> 15:02.628
You couldn't fucking wait?

15:02.668 --> 15:05.330
We were about to have
all the legal weed we wanted.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.636
You know, in Amsterdam,
where we were going!

15:26.759 --> 15:28.420
Thought you could
get away with this, huh?

15:32.431 --> 15:39.462
You thought that after 9/11
our national security was a joke, huh?

15:40.339 --> 15:41.931
Well...

15:44.877 --> 15:46.037
guess what?

15:47.012 --> 15:48.274
What?

15:50.115 --> 15:52.709
We knew you fuckers would be back.

15:52.751 --> 15:53.911
- Holy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.

15:53.952 --> 15:56.716
- We love America. We love America!
- Very much.

15:56.755 --> 15:58.484
That's a convenient thing to say...

15:58.524 --> 16:01.493
after you try and blow up a plane
filled with Americans!

16:01.527 --> 16:02.755
- No.
- No, we didn't do...

16:02.795 --> 16:05.320
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

16:05.364 --> 16:07.195
My idiot friend here
brought marijuana...

16:07.232 --> 16:08.722
- on the plane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

16:08.767 --> 16:12.828
Zip it, Hello Kitty. OK? I know
your operation's funded through drugs.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.736
No. This is typical
government bullshit, sir. I...

16:14.773 --> 16:16.536
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!
- I...

16:16.575 --> 16:20.443
- No, I'm trying to explain it! Harold!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

16:22.748 --> 16:24.909
Do we have the right
to make a phone call?

16:26.085 --> 16:27.712
Yeah. Yeah!

16:27.753 --> 16:31.120
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.818
You want freedoms right now.

16:33.859 --> 16:35.724
Is it time? Is it freedom o'clock?

16:39.164 --> 16:41.257
- Guess what.
- What?

16:42.134 --> 16:47.231
Where you guys are going,
they have never even heard of rights.

16:48.440 --> 16:50.408
Well, where are we going?

16:57.683 --> 17:01.517
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!

17:02.387 --> 17:04.355
I'm an innocent man.

17:04.923 --> 17:07.357
I donate blood.

17:07.392 --> 17:10.292
And toys for tots.

17:14.066 --> 17:16.694
And now I'm in Guantànamo Bay.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.828
See why I'm against paying taxes?

17:18.871 --> 17:20.634
Hey! Hey.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.804
Fuck you!

17:22.840 --> 17:24.809
Dude, calm down, OK?

17:24.843 --> 17:28.506
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toilet.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.515
The pillow actually
looks pretty comfortable.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.047
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.350
- Ever.
- OK.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.619
- No! Shut up!
- OK.

17:42.194 --> 17:43.525
So what are you guys in here for?

17:45.631 --> 17:50.864
For giving the United States
a taste of their own medicine.

17:51.837 --> 17:55.967
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.340
Others call us heroes.

17:58.377 --> 18:01.972
Screw that. You think you guys
are heroes for killing innocent people?

18:02.014 --> 18:04.141
It's 'cause of assholes like you
that we're even in this fucking place...

18:04.183 --> 18:05.582
you fucking cowards!

18:05.617 --> 18:08.450
Well, maybe if the people in your country
stopped eating donuts...

18:08.487 --> 18:11.285
and started realizing what your
government is doing to the world...

18:11.323 --> 18:13.689
assholes like us wouldn't exist.

18:13.725 --> 18:16.592
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.

18:16.628 --> 18:17.925
You like donuts?

18:17.963 --> 18:21.194
Well, wait till you see
what they make you eat in here.

18:21.233 --> 18:23.394
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?

18:23.435 --> 18:25.027
I...

18:25.070 --> 18:27.766
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.165
What's a cockmeat sandwich?

18:31.677 --> 18:32.871
You're about to find out.

18:35.514 --> 18:38.176
Right about now. Sucker.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.618
All right, cockmeat sandwich time.
You know the drill.

18:45.657 --> 18:48.353
What about them? They just got here!

18:51.263 --> 18:52.787
Big Bob's taking care of them.

18:52.831 --> 18:55.299
- Big Bob.
- Big Bob?

18:55.334 --> 18:57.700
I hope you like donuts.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.796
Let's go to work. Hey, listen, guys, enjoy.

19:03.175 --> 19:04.437
Holy shit.

19:04.476 --> 19:06.671
Oh, yeah, that's it.

19:07.646 --> 19:11.241
- This is not good.
- No, Kumar, it is not good.

19:11.283 --> 19:13.547
- I've never had to suck a dick before.
- Me neither.

19:13.585 --> 19:15.576
I bet it sucks dick.

19:17.522 --> 19:19.217
Shit, dude.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.226
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.388
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Come on.

19:24.429 --> 19:27.125
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.496
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.398
- Please don't let it be Big Bob.
- I'm Big Bob.

19:30.435 --> 19:33.404
- Fuck.
- Yes, you are.

19:34.873 --> 19:36.898
You boys ready
for your cockmeat sandwich?

19:39.077 --> 19:40.066
No?

19:40.112 --> 19:42.012
Well, you better get hungry real fast...

19:42.047 --> 19:45.847
'cause I got a whole lot of sandwich
waitin' for ya.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.446
Holy shit!

19:48.487 --> 19:51.684
- All right, let's get goin'.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob...

19:51.723 --> 19:55.250
I got to ask you a question
before this all goes down.

19:55.294 --> 19:58.195
- All the guards in Guantànamo are gay?
- Fuck, no!

19:58.230 --> 20:00.824
Ain't nothing gay
about getting your dick sucked!

20:00.866 --> 20:03.699
You're the ones that's gay
for suckin' my dick!

20:03.735 --> 20:05.396
- What?
- In fact...

20:05.437 --> 20:08.964
creeps me out
just bein' around you fags.

20:09.007 --> 20:10.440
- But...
- All right.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.670
- Wait...
- Get down on your knees...

20:12.711 --> 20:14.406
- and open your mouths.
- Please, Big Bob.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.640
Why don't you just
kick our ass instead?

20:15.681 --> 20:17.876
- Get on your fucking knees!
- All right. All right.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.682
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- You go first, dude.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.779
Hope you boys like extra mayo.

20:23.822 --> 20:26.552
- Jesus, Kumar.
- Oh, I hate you so much!

20:26.591 --> 20:28.024
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.494
God, his dick smells like shit, dude.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.030
Holy shit!

20:38.337 --> 20:42.637
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.509
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!

20:49.548 --> 20:51.914
Should we?
What if they kill us out there?

20:51.950 --> 20:53.611
They're gonna fucking make us
suck their dicks if we don't.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.051
We're gonna die in here. Come on.

20:58.290 --> 21:00.383
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:00.959 --> 21:05.020
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.031
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Fuck!

21:07.065 --> 21:09.329
Oh, shit. Shit.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.858
Door, door.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.200
Look, look, look.

21:17.242 --> 21:18.869
What the fuck is he doing?

21:30.989 --> 21:34.152
We've got to go
now, now, now, now, now!

21:36.628 --> 21:38.596
It smells like burnt asshole.

21:42.100 --> 21:44.068
I can't fucking believe this.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.127
Fuck!

21:50.842 --> 21:52.309
My wrist is swelling, man!

21:52.344 --> 21:54.312
- Shut up.
- We're gonna die in a jungle!

21:54.346 --> 21:55.904
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

21:55.947 --> 21:59.781
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

22:01.019 --> 22:03.385
- What?
- OK. Fuck.

22:03.422 --> 22:04.912
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?

22:06.224 --> 22:08.454
All right.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.983
Hey, look, look!

22:14.199 --> 22:15.461
Excuse me.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.429
You guys going to America?

22:18.470 --> 22:19.698
<i>Sì, vamos.</i>

22:19.738 --> 22:21.638
Yes, we're going.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.140
Thank you.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.233
<i>- Es mìo.
- Vamos, vamos.</i>

22:24.309 --> 22:25.333
I'm telling you, Jorge...

22:25.377 --> 22:27.470
the first thing you have to do
when you get to America...

22:27.512 --> 22:30.413
buy a device called TiVo, OK?

22:30.449 --> 22:32.815
Freedom means nothing if you're
a slave to regular programming...

22:32.851 --> 22:34.284
I promise you that.

22:34.319 --> 22:36.287
And now, how about you focus?

22:36.321 --> 22:38.585
We gotta figure out what to do
when we get to the States.

22:38.623 --> 22:41.456
We don't have wallets. We don't
have any ID. We've got nothing.

22:41.493 --> 22:45.190
Well, I figure we're gonna land
somewhere around Miami, right?

22:45.230 --> 22:47.391
There's only one guy we know
who lives down there.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.866
- Who do we know that... Raza.
- Yeah.

22:49.901 --> 22:51.994
We gotta go see Raza.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.801
<i>- Adiòs.
- Hasta /uego.</i>

22:54.840 --> 22:57.775
- Thanks again.
- What nice people.

22:57.809 --> 23:00.175
Man, South Florida here we are.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.680
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

23:02.714 --> 23:04.648
The professional way.
We walk. Let's go.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.150
- Walk?
- Yeah.

23:06.184 --> 23:08.175
So I guess Raza's...

23:08.220 --> 23:10.381
- We'll find it, we'll find it.
... thataway. Yeah.

23:10.422 --> 23:11.787
<i># Da/e asì, papi #</i>

- Kinda ghetto for Miami.

- Hi.
- Hey.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.774
Y'all aren't here to complain
about the noise, are you?

23:41.620 --> 23:44.919
No. We're not...
here to complain about the noise.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.481
We're...

23:50.095 --> 23:51.255
We are here to see...

23:51.296 --> 23:53.594
- What is his name? We're here...
- Vagina.

23:53.632 --> 23:56.999
No, we're here to see Raza.

23:57.035 --> 23:59.265
OK. Follow me.

23:59.304 --> 24:00.862
Thank you, ma'am.

24:01.506 --> 24:04.373
We'll follow... you, I guess.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.639
# She said, "Boy, go ahead" #

24:11.683 --> 24:13.674
# As long as I don't touch it #

24:13.718 --> 24:17.415
# I said, "Now, why the hell
would I wanna interrupt it?" #

24:17.455 --> 24:18.444
Hey.

24:19.224 --> 24:21.385
- Very patriotic of you.
- Thank you.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.529
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

24:26.731 --> 24:28.995
- Hey, Raza!
- What?

24:29.034 --> 24:30.262
What's up?

24:30.302 --> 24:31.633
- Kumar and Roldy?
- What's up, man?

24:31.670 --> 24:34.298
I haven't seen you guys
since graduation.

24:34.339 --> 24:35.897
What are you guys doing here?

24:35.941 --> 24:38.603
Wait, what's up
with the orange jumpsuits?

24:38.643 --> 24:40.110
- Hey, no, no, question number one...
- It's kind of a long story. I...

24:40.145 --> 24:41.806
...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?

24:41.846 --> 24:44.314
There's exposed vagina
all over your house.

24:44.349 --> 24:46.715
Yeah. That was my idea.

24:46.751 --> 24:50.414
I don't know about you guys,
I'm sick of all the hype over topless.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.855
Really? I always liked toplessness.
That's...

24:52.891 --> 24:53.880
- That's just me.
- Yeah? Well, I'm starting...

24:53.925 --> 24:57.520
the bottomless trend.
Hence, the bottomless party.

24:57.562 --> 24:58.551
So what are you guys doing
in South Beach?

24:58.597 --> 25:00.690
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.461
- Where are you going?
- Bang bang, buddy.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.832
Listen. I'm really sorry
to bother you with this.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.530
- You all right?
- Not really.

25:09.307 --> 25:12.640
They were locked up for less than
an hour, and they already escaped?

25:12.677 --> 25:15.510
Damn it. Make sure the press
doesn't get wind of this.

25:15.547 --> 25:17.515
Don't need the public thinking
we're some two-bit operation.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.538
Got it, sir.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.448
It must have been either al-Qaeda
or North Korea who broke 'em up.

25:20.485 --> 25:22.077
Find out if they have
any relatives in the country.

25:22.120 --> 25:25.146
You probably should have
done that in the first place.

25:30.128 --> 25:34.997
Do you have a problem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?

25:35.033 --> 25:37.365
I'm just saying that...

25:37.402 --> 25:41.236
I've looked through the files
on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.

25:41.272 --> 25:42.830
They were both born
and raised in New Jersey.

25:42.874 --> 25:44.705
Other than a couple of traffic tickets,
they're clean.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.075
Right. That's why
they just broke out of prison.

25:47.112 --> 25:49.979
But they... It's not even clear that they
should have been there in the first place.

25:50.015 --> 25:52.006
Shut your...

25:58.990 --> 26:00.855
You see this cute, little white girl,
Beecher?

26:00.892 --> 26:02.223
Yeah.

26:02.260 --> 26:06.196
Do you want her to get raped
and murdered?

26:07.599 --> 26:08.588
Of course not.

26:08.633 --> 26:11.363
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

26:11.936 --> 26:15.633
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.

26:15.674 --> 26:19.110
Then stop fucking with me.

26:23.014 --> 26:24.481
This is serious.

26:25.517 --> 26:27.417
She's adorable.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.316
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

26:31.356 --> 26:33.586
It's just it's Kumar's fault.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.525
If we get out of this...

26:35.560 --> 26:38.927
the chances of us remaining friends
is highly...

26:38.963 --> 26:40.157
highly... boobies. Yeah.

26:40.198 --> 26:42.223
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

26:42.267 --> 26:44.735
Put that back on. And keep it on.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.896
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.031
Yo. What are you guys talking about?

26:49.074 --> 26:51.099
Roldy was just letting me
in on your situation.

26:51.142 --> 26:53.076
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.

26:53.111 --> 26:55.045
What about that fuckin' time
we had to cover for you...

26:55.080 --> 26:56.843
lie to your ex-girlfriend
about how you got crabs?

26:56.881 --> 26:58.041
You owe us, man.

26:58.083 --> 26:59.380
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

26:59.417 --> 27:01.578
- OK, that was a long time ago.
- I love crabs.

27:01.619 --> 27:03.416
Speaking of ex-girlfriends...

27:03.455 --> 27:05.184
isn't yours getting married
or something?

27:05.223 --> 27:07.157
How does everybody know about this
except for me?

27:07.192 --> 27:08.625
Wait.

27:09.661 --> 27:11.788
Colton! Colton Graham can help us out.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.195
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!

27:13.231 --> 27:15.927
No doubt. If anyone could
clear your names, it's him.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.662
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not helping us.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.636
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?

27:19.671 --> 27:23.698
Not anymore. But the wedding is
at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

27:24.275 --> 27:26.266
But you don't want to bother them
when they're doing their whole...

27:26.311 --> 27:28.336
wedding thing, right?

27:30.248 --> 27:33.183
You know,
that actually might be our only hope.

27:33.218 --> 27:36.483
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't
go to the airport. They're looking for us.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.113
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?

27:38.156 --> 27:41.887
But first... y'all got to get
in the spirit of the party.

27:41.926 --> 27:45.123
- What do you mean, spirit of...
- What do you think I mean?

27:45.930 --> 27:49.024
- What about you?
- Me? I've been in the spirit.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.098
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, dude!

27:52.137 --> 27:53.365
Oh, my God!

27:53.404 --> 27:55.235
- Love your dickdo, Raza.
- Yeah. Drink it in.

27:55.273 --> 27:58.470
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.740
I know, right? All right, boys.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.542
Your turn. Let 'em dangle.

28:04.048 --> 28:06.016
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.177
Count of three?

28:08.219 --> 28:09.914
One.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.444
Two, three.

28:13.792 --> 28:16.056
Your cocks are awesome, man!

28:16.094 --> 28:18.426
That's not even necessary.

28:18.463 --> 28:20.590
- Would you please...
- Oh, my dick!

28:20.632 --> 28:22.827
# My dick cost a late-night fee #

28:22.867 --> 28:24.994
# Your dick got the HIV #

28:25.036 --> 28:27.596
# My dick plays on
the double feature screen #

28:27.639 --> 28:29.937
# Your dick went straight to DVD #

28:29.974 --> 28:32.534
# My dick bigger than a bridge #

28:32.577 --> 28:34.875
# Your dick look like a little kid's #

28:34.913 --> 28:37.814
# My dick large like the Chargers,
the whole team #

28:37.849 --> 28:39.612
# Your shit look like you 14 #

28:39.651 --> 28:42.085
# My dick locked in a cage, right #

28:42.120 --> 28:44.247
# Your dick suffer from stage fright #

28:44.289 --> 28:46.917
# My dick so hot it's stolen #

28:46.958 --> 28:49.449
# Your dick look like Gary Coleman #

28:49.494 --> 28:51.985
# My dick pink and big #

28:52.030 --> 28:56.228
- This car is frickin' sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

28:56.267 --> 28:57.791
'Cause we're fugitives.

28:57.836 --> 29:00.828
Driving a yellow convertible
with the top down, dressed like assholes!

29:00.872 --> 29:03.864
Yo. Yo. Yo, look, he has
one of these things.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.899
- Would you put that down?
- No, you can hook up to the Internet.

29:05.944 --> 29:08.606
<i>You can play Mike Tyson's Punch-Out/
on it. King Hippo's going down.</i>

29:08.646 --> 29:10.511
Put that away. Put that away.

29:10.548 --> 29:14.348
I can't believe you can even think about
playing games at a time like this, man.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.013
You realize what would happen
if our parents found out about this?

29:17.589 --> 29:20.422
You have sent our sons
to Guantànamo Bay?

29:20.458 --> 29:22.619
This is an outrage!

29:23.328 --> 29:26.627
You Arabs think you can just mix in
with our peaceful society...

29:26.664 --> 29:27.824
and we're not gonna find you, huh?

29:27.866 --> 29:30.300
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

29:30.335 --> 29:34.829
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue
seblantics with you, OK?

29:34.873 --> 29:36.932
I'm here to save lives.

29:36.975 --> 29:40.069
Ask the Lees what they know
about their son's terrorist activity.

29:49.821 --> 29:53.689
Look, we have been American citizens
for over 40 years.

29:53.725 --> 29:57.217
Now, frankly, I find this very offensive.

29:59.364 --> 30:03.767
They're using some sort of dialect
I've never heard before.

30:03.801 --> 30:06.964
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.105
Tell them we know
what their son is up to...

30:12.143 --> 30:15.010
and if they don't cooperate,
he could be sentenced to death.

30:16.614 --> 30:18.809
Hit 'em. Yeah.

30:22.787 --> 30:24.721
We know what he said!

30:24.756 --> 30:27.748
Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys.

30:31.429 --> 30:33.659
I'm a pretty good translator.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.461
It's total gibberish.

30:37.235 --> 30:38.725
They may be trying to stonewall us.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.936
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

30:41.973 --> 30:42.962
You speak Korean?

30:43.007 --> 30:44.804
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?

30:44.842 --> 30:48.903
Do you have a masters
in romantic Korean literature?

30:48.947 --> 30:50.972
Because I do...

30:51.015 --> 30:52.573
and I'm offended.

30:53.785 --> 30:54.774
Good enough for me.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.847
Look, excuse me...

30:57.889 --> 31:00.255
we're not looking to hurt your sons...

31:00.291 --> 31:02.691
we just wanna know where they are.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.922
Do you know if they know anybody
in Florida?

31:06.097 --> 31:09.430
Their friend Raza Syed lives in Miami.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.501
But why would they be there?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.299
He's supposed to be in medical school.

31:13.338 --> 31:18.503
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!

31:21.145 --> 31:23.705
These fuckers are goin' down.

31:23.748 --> 31:25.648
Dead. Or alive.

31:25.683 --> 31:28.982
Tell them that in your fake
ching-chong language.

31:31.122 --> 31:32.487
Shut up! You're an idiot.

31:34.058 --> 31:37.118
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

31:37.161 --> 31:38.150
but fuck you.

31:38.196 --> 31:39.288
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?

31:39.330 --> 31:41.525
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?

31:49.507 --> 31:51.702
Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.141
Wow, we actually get a first-hand look
at the South, huh?

31:55.179 --> 31:58.740
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip
through the South, OK?

31:58.783 --> 32:01.274
This was supposed to be
the most romantic week of my life.

32:01.319 --> 32:04.015
Remember that? Before you
fucked it up? You remember that?

32:04.055 --> 32:06.250
Just chill, OK?
We'll be out of this situation.

32:06.290 --> 32:09.487
You'll be up in Maria's guts
in no time, all right?

32:09.527 --> 32:13.486
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

32:13.531 --> 32:17.729
I've never felt this way
about anyone before, really.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.369
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?

32:21.406 --> 32:23.704
It's not like you would understand, so...

32:34.685 --> 32:36.846
# I want to be happy #

32:38.122 --> 32:40.682
# I want to be happy, just like... #

32:40.725 --> 32:44.786
Excuse me, please.
Will you turn that off? This is a library.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.196
What a fucking chode.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.224
Thank you, come again!

32:57.575 --> 32:59.702
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.336
You know, the whole reason
people come to the stacks...

33:01.379 --> 33:03.904
is for some peace and...

33:04.916 --> 33:06.474
quiet.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.350
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when people disturb me here too.

33:09.387 --> 33:12.515
It's just this fucking calculus final
is killing me.

33:14.058 --> 33:17.960
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.

33:17.995 --> 33:22.125
- You're actually very close. May I?
- Yeah.

33:22.166 --> 33:23.963
Excuse me.

33:28.539 --> 33:30.734
I touched your breast.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.243
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.848
You just go...

33:39.884 --> 33:42.785
Wow. You're good at this.

33:42.820 --> 33:44.082
Thanks.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.818
What did you, like, take calculus
in high school or something?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.850
Actually, my dad taught it to me
in sixth grade.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.419
What, are you like Doogie Howser?

33:52.463 --> 33:55.694
No. Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.224
I love that show.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.864
What are you working on there?

34:00.905 --> 34:03.806
This is just a poem
for my creative writing class.

34:03.841 --> 34:06.173
It's like...

34:06.210 --> 34:08.007
<i>- "The Square Root Of Three"?
- No, no, I'm sorry...</i>

34:08.045 --> 34:10.842
- "A poem of love by Kumar Patel. "
- I need this.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.940
- Hey, let me read it.
- No, no.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.214
- Why?
- Because it's lame.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.277
Then read it to me.

34:16.320 --> 34:20.313
There's no way I'm letting you see me
in that light. Good luck with your calculus.

34:21.359 --> 34:25.728
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You
know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy.

34:25.763 --> 34:28.755
Look, I'm not even gonna be
showing this to my professor, all right?

34:28.799 --> 34:30.994
That's why I'm so stressed out
right now.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.264
Stressed out, huh?

34:33.304 --> 34:35.204
Come with me.

34:36.407 --> 34:38.739
...going?
- Come on.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.504
What?

34:47.851 --> 34:51.844
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?

34:52.489 --> 34:55.118
Don't worry. It'll help you relax.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.627
Oh, boy.

34:57.662 --> 35:00.130
It's illegal.

35:00.164 --> 35:04.897
# I want your fish right by me #

35:05.503 --> 35:08.404
# That's how it has to be #

35:08.439 --> 35:09.633
Here.

35:09.674 --> 35:12.268
#... copacetic if you let it so set up #

35:12.310 --> 35:15.939
# And keep the downstream down
and the upstream up #

35:17.815 --> 35:19.544
This is poison.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.484
# My stoney, my baby #

35:21.519 --> 35:23.180
Let me help you.

35:23.221 --> 35:25.917
# Funk the groovin' thang whistlin' #

35:25.957 --> 35:27.584
# As I rip my rhymes #

35:27.625 --> 35:30.185
# Time and time again struttin'
and in the summertime #

35:30.228 --> 35:32.423
# So screw it,
strip down and be generic #

35:32.463 --> 35:34.897
# Strip down and be a passenger
Strip down and be a messenger #

35:34.932 --> 35:37.560
# In askin' why I'm born
I come up blank in the winter #

35:37.602 --> 35:40.230
# In askin' why I'm born
I come up on when I'm on her #

35:40.271 --> 35:42.466
# It's time to find the kind #
# My summer, his summer #

35:42.506 --> 35:44.098
I'm Kumar.

35:45.743 --> 35:47.040
Vanessa.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.444
You're still not reading that poem.

35:49.480 --> 35:53.439
# And then I kiss my stoney baby #

35:53.484 --> 35:55.782
# My stoney, my stoney #

35:55.820 --> 35:58.118
# My stoney baby #

35:58.155 --> 36:00.715
# My stoney #

36:00.758 --> 36:02.783
# My stoney baby #

36:03.461 --> 36:04.723
Kumar.

36:05.763 --> 36:08.891
# My stoney baby #

36:08.933 --> 36:09.922
Kumar.

36:09.967 --> 36:11.798
Kumar. Kumar.

36:11.969 --> 36:14.170
- Kumar.
- Yeah.

36:14.205 --> 36:17.470
What's going on? We're in Birmingham,
Alabama. Are we supposed to be here?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.669
What's going on?

36:19.710 --> 36:21.837
- Why did you bring us here, dude?
- What do you mean, why did I...

36:21.879 --> 36:25.144
You were supposed to be following the
directions, asshole. What do you mean?

36:25.182 --> 36:27.776
There's got to be like a highway
or something, right?

36:27.818 --> 36:30.116
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.920
What's going on up there?

36:32.957 --> 36:34.322
# Squad up #

36:34.358 --> 36:35.985
# My niggas #

36:36.027 --> 36:37.927
# I see some pussy-ass niggas,
so what the fuck... #

36:37.962 --> 36:40.430
What the hell is this?

36:40.464 --> 36:41.556
# We knock these niggas out #

36:41.599 --> 36:43.658
# I see some pussy-ass niggas,
so what the fuck you wanna do? #

36:43.701 --> 36:46.363
- I'm turning around.
- Nah, just go through, man.

36:47.171 --> 36:49.071
Dude, we're not driving
through this basketball game.

36:49.106 --> 36:51.734
You know, Roldy, I really thought
you were bigger than this.

36:51.776 --> 36:54.108
Dude, I'm not scared
'cause they're black.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.407
I'm scared because they're scary.

36:55.446 --> 36:57.812
And it's not like we got
Gregory Hines out there.

36:57.848 --> 36:58.837
They're not that scary.

37:00.584 --> 37:03.144
It's my ball!

37:03.187 --> 37:04.654
Turn around.

37:04.689 --> 37:07.658
# Rob this motherfucker,
drop his punk ass in a ditch #

37:07.692 --> 37:10.593
# Drag this pussy nigga,
slap his ass up like a bitch #

37:10.628 --> 37:12.186
# My niggas is my niggas
'cause my niggas... #

37:12.229 --> 37:14.561
- Fuck! It won't move!
- Shit, dude.

37:14.598 --> 37:16.065
# Shoot him dead between his lips #

37:16.100 --> 37:17.192
# I see some pussy... #

37:18.202 --> 37:19.726
- That's not good.
- Now there's no music, man.

37:19.770 --> 37:21.362
Shit, man.

37:21.405 --> 37:24.340
- Motherfucker!
- My Jordans, nigga!

37:24.375 --> 37:26.240
- Shit, this isn't good.
- This is not good. This is not good.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.808
No. No. No.

37:29.847 --> 37:31.371
They're coming over here.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.349
- Fucking shit. Why did you do that?
- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.755
They're getting weapons, man.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.223
All right, what do we do?
What do we do?

37:41.258 --> 37:43.556
Run, run, run. Run, run.

37:48.966 --> 37:51.730
Yo. Yo.

37:52.636 --> 37:55.537
- Where y'all going? Damn!
- We was just trying to help.

37:55.573 --> 37:59.737
Man, somebody call the police.
We need to report this.

38:13.958 --> 38:18.452
- Yeah, that's right. You like the ride?
- Fuck you, man.

38:18.496 --> 38:23.126
They abandoned it last night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.658
The witnesses' description
of the driver and passenger...

38:25.703 --> 38:28.536
match that of Lee and Patel.

38:29.840 --> 38:33.901
We tried bringing in Syed last night,
but he's already left the country.

38:35.079 --> 38:37.980
Well, they know we're closing in on 'em,
that's why.

38:38.015 --> 38:40.609
OK. No, I'll give you a call. All right.

38:42.353 --> 38:44.446
No, no, no, no!

38:44.488 --> 38:45.819
- Holy shit!
- Easy, easy!

38:45.856 --> 38:47.653
- Easy.
- Easy!

38:47.691 --> 38:49.420
This is our witness.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.325
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

38:51.362 --> 38:52.488
You all know I got one!

38:52.530 --> 38:54.191
I got one too!

38:56.534 --> 39:00.766
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

39:00.805 --> 39:03.365
Yeah. It was like
I was telling the Sheriff...

39:03.407 --> 39:07.343
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're telling the truth?

39:07.378 --> 39:09.243
I don't have a reason
to lie to you, man.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.645
Really?

39:10.681 --> 39:13.479
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'll see.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.348
That ain't right.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.320
Where's he going?

39:19.056 --> 39:20.751
What's going on?

39:24.495 --> 39:25.484
Hell no!

39:25.529 --> 39:27.861
Now why don't you tell me
what really happened?

39:27.898 --> 39:29.763
Is that grape soda?

39:29.800 --> 39:31.665
What the fuck, yo?

39:34.572 --> 39:36.767
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

39:36.807 --> 39:38.240
This is so ignorant.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.266
- Really?
- Yes.

39:40.311 --> 39:42.279
Is this ignorant?

39:42.313 --> 39:44.804
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

39:44.849 --> 39:46.976
Hey, Jon, are you gonna let him do that?

39:47.751 --> 39:50.049
See if he got Kool-Aid.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.987
Almost gone, witness.

39:52.022 --> 39:53.956
Sure there's not something
you wanna tell me?

39:53.991 --> 39:55.891
I'm not stoppin' until you crack!

39:55.926 --> 39:57.018
I already told you
that they took off runnin'!

39:57.061 --> 39:58.392
All right, all right, all right.

39:58.429 --> 40:01.125
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is telling you the truth!

40:01.165 --> 40:03.725
Yeah, and how can you be
so sure, Beecher?

40:03.767 --> 40:07.203
'Cause he doesn't have a police record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

40:09.273 --> 40:13.539
OK, then, Beech. How do you
propose we find the terrorists, huh?

40:14.378 --> 40:17.245
There was a Nokia 7710
taken from the console.

40:17.281 --> 40:18.543
We have its tracking numbers.

40:18.582 --> 40:21.710
Our satellites are running a trace on it,
as we speak.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.811
I'm serious about that Kool-Aid.

40:23.854 --> 40:25.082
What's going on? Where are you?

40:25.122 --> 40:26.521
Dude, that is a fucking long story.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.549
We're actually in Alabama right now,
heading to Texas.

40:31.095 --> 40:33.188
What is that sound? Are you jerking off
again? What are you doing?

40:33.230 --> 40:35.528
I'm taking a glorious pee-pee.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.625
Hey, listen, you're not gonna believe this...

40:37.668 --> 40:40.296
but the other night,
I ended up at that Asian party...

40:40.337 --> 40:42.897
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.908
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

40:44.942 --> 40:47.069
Yeah, man,
she even gave me a blumpkin.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.373
What is a blumpkin?

40:48.412 --> 40:51.506
It's when a girl gives you head while
you're sitting on the toilet takin' a shit.

40:51.549 --> 40:53.176
Really?

40:53.217 --> 40:55.777
- Hello?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

40:55.819 --> 40:58.344
Hello? Come, come?

41:00.124 --> 41:01.557
Did you go?

41:01.592 --> 41:03.059
Yeah, I'm done.

41:03.093 --> 41:06.028
You said to me we were gonna
cross swords. You promised.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.860
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

41:08.899 --> 41:12.528
Are you talking on a cellphone
when the government is looking for us?

41:12.570 --> 41:15.061
Dude, it was just Goldstein.
I had something important to tell him.

41:15.105 --> 41:16.868
It's 'cause you had something...
That's good, that's OK.

41:16.907 --> 41:22.470
Nothing is more important
than finding a way to get to Texas.

41:22.513 --> 41:23.502
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

41:23.547 --> 41:27.950
We've been walking an entire day
and we have not seen a street sign.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.111
Do you get it?

41:29.153 --> 41:32.418
- Can I say...
- Again. This is... I can't.

41:32.456 --> 41:33.650
Dude, honestly...

41:33.691 --> 41:37.058
you've got to be a little more positive
about these things, all right?

41:37.094 --> 41:40.359
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't...

41:40.397 --> 41:43.798
First of all, look at this beautiful
Alabama landscape, OK?

41:43.834 --> 41:46.928
You don't get shit like this in New Jersey.

41:47.771 --> 41:49.170
God, you...

41:49.239 --> 41:50.706
Hey, look, dude.

41:50.741 --> 41:52.641
It's a baby deer.

41:53.444 --> 41:57.005
- Wow. Man.
- Shit.

41:59.650 --> 42:02.483
Hey. Hey.

42:02.519 --> 42:05.977
Look how cute this deer is, dude. Not
like those asshole deer in New Jersey.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.513
I know, man.

42:07.558 --> 42:10.083
- Hey, buddy.
- Dude, Alabama's awesome.

42:10.127 --> 42:11.924
He likes you.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.424
- Oh, my God!
- No!

42:18.435 --> 42:21.370
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

42:24.541 --> 42:28.204
What the hell are y'all doing out here
in them fancy clothes?

42:28.245 --> 42:30.770
We were on our way to Texas
and we got lost.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.304
Texas?

42:33.417 --> 42:35.578
You're a long way from Texas.

42:35.919 --> 42:36.943
No!

42:40.624 --> 42:43.286
Born in '04.

42:43.327 --> 42:44.988
Get in here.

42:48.298 --> 42:51.392
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

42:51.435 --> 42:55.235
- Y'all need a place to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

42:55.272 --> 42:57.331
You want to follow me?

42:58.242 --> 42:59.834
Come on.

43:00.844 --> 43:02.835
Maybe we shouldn't.

43:03.514 --> 43:06.244
It's already dead.
You need a hand, dude?

43:06.884 --> 43:09.478
My grandpappy
bought this land in 1902.

43:09.520 --> 43:11.988
Very nice, sir.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.252
This place is gonna suck.

43:18.328 --> 43:20.956
Honey, I'm home.

43:20.998 --> 43:22.431
<i># E verào #</i>

43:24.201 --> 43:27.432
<i># Atencào #</i>

43:27.471 --> 43:28.836
I'm in here.

43:32.242 --> 43:35.143
I wish you'd-a told me
you was bringing guests home.

43:35.179 --> 43:37.044
I'da straightened up in here.

43:37.081 --> 43:39.174
Fellas, this is my wife Raylene.

43:39.216 --> 43:41.844
Raylene, meet Harold and Kumar.

43:41.885 --> 43:43.352
Hello.

43:43.387 --> 43:47.653
Can't shake.
I've just got... deer head all over me.

43:47.691 --> 43:49.989
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you boys.

43:50.027 --> 43:52.518
- You just make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

43:52.563 --> 43:54.121
Honey, something's wrong
with that DSL.

43:54.164 --> 43:57.224
Every time I go on the online,
it says, "Searching for server. "

43:57.267 --> 43:59.132
You try unplugging the AirPort base?

43:59.169 --> 44:01.296
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

44:01.338 --> 44:02.862
What you need to go online fors,
anyways?

44:02.906 --> 44:06.034
I was gonna get one of them
new portable satellite radios.

44:06.076 --> 44:08.704
What the fuck
you need a satellite radio for?

44:08.746 --> 44:11.044
Don't you be cussin'
when we got company over.

44:11.081 --> 44:12.207
- Guys.
- Please don't worry about us.

44:12.249 --> 44:13.546
We cuss all the time.

44:13.584 --> 44:14.915
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

44:14.952 --> 44:17.079
Who do you think bought you
that Prada bag?

44:17.121 --> 44:18.986
I told you I wanted a Gucci one.

44:19.022 --> 44:20.284
The Gucci bag cost more!

44:20.324 --> 44:22.622
Well, Jan Sapperstein's husband
sure could afford it.

44:22.659 --> 44:24.820
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

44:24.862 --> 44:27.126
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

44:27.164 --> 44:28.426
You be happy with what you have.

44:28.465 --> 44:31.127
What I have is a husband
who ain't worth a turd!

44:31.168 --> 44:32.533
You wanna give me shit now?

44:32.569 --> 44:34.628
- That's right!
- After everything I let you buy!

44:34.671 --> 44:36.070
Even look at the credit card bills?

44:36.106 --> 44:38.802
...you buy?! Do you think we need
another set of golf balls?

44:38.842 --> 44:41.777
- Even worse is the credit card miles.
- Stinky, smelly, motherf...

44:41.812 --> 44:43.609
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

44:43.647 --> 44:47.344
Nonsense. Don't be silly.
You're our guests.

44:47.384 --> 44:49.852
You guys have got to stay for supper.

44:49.887 --> 44:51.479
- No, we couldn't. That's...
- No, thank you. We really couldn't...

44:51.522 --> 44:55.925
Of course, we're gonna
have to get high first.

45:19.149 --> 45:21.140
We're close.

45:28.358 --> 45:30.986
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.

45:31.028 --> 45:34.486
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.

45:34.531 --> 45:36.522
You know, this is great, guys.

45:36.567 --> 45:38.660
I kind of always,
you know, sort of assumed...

45:38.702 --> 45:42.069
that people from the South
were kinda...

45:42.105 --> 45:44.005
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

45:44.041 --> 45:46.669
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...

45:46.710 --> 45:50.646
We do try to keep our inbred son in
the basement when we have company.

45:50.681 --> 45:53.013
Guys, I didn't mean it like that. I was just...

45:57.120 --> 45:58.985
Look at their faces!

46:04.328 --> 46:05.317
Fuck, fuck!

46:05.362 --> 46:07.023
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.

46:07.064 --> 46:08.656
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

46:08.699 --> 46:10.690
Are you boys in some kind of trouble?

46:10.734 --> 46:13.567
All right. This is gonna sound crazy,
but, basically...

46:13.604 --> 46:14.866
we were on a plane to Amsterdam...

46:14.905 --> 46:17.567
and we got mistaken for terrorists
and we got sent to Guantànamo Bay...

46:17.608 --> 46:19.735
and then we escaped and snuck
into America with a bunch of Cubans...

46:19.776 --> 46:20.800
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

46:20.844 --> 46:21.833
where there's a guy
who can help us out...

46:21.879 --> 46:23.779
and he's getting married
to Kumar's ex-girlfriend.

46:23.814 --> 46:25.543
Yes.

46:26.416 --> 46:29.112
OK. That's cool.

46:29.152 --> 46:31.586
- I understand that.
- You do?

46:31.622 --> 46:35.854
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?

46:35.893 --> 46:37.952
Y'all come down here and hide
in the basement. I will handle this.

46:37.995 --> 46:39.428
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.431
Thank you, thank you.

46:50.807 --> 46:53.742
OK. This isn't creepy.

46:57.281 --> 46:58.714
What the hell is that?

47:00.617 --> 47:03.313
You're walking
towards the creepy music?

47:03.887 --> 47:05.149
Ge...

47:05.188 --> 47:06.746
This song rocks, dude.

47:13.530 --> 47:14.519
Kumar.

47:21.071 --> 47:23.801
Hey, dude, there's a lighter here
with a clown on it.

47:25.275 --> 47:26.799
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

47:27.577 --> 47:28.635
God!

47:39.723 --> 47:42.886
Hey, you don't happen to have
a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

47:42.926 --> 47:45.486
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

47:45.529 --> 47:48.464
<i>That's how Chunk won over Sloth
in The Goonies.</i>

47:48.498 --> 47:50.432
This thing looks like Sloth?

47:50.467 --> 47:52.628
All I saw was the creature's hand.

47:52.669 --> 47:54.364
The hand looks like Sloth?

47:54.404 --> 47:58.534
The fucking hand of an evil monster,
dude. Like fucking claws and shit.

47:58.575 --> 48:00.372
Shit.

48:00.410 --> 48:04.779
Listen, no matter what, don't let
the creature know that it's ugly, OK?

48:04.815 --> 48:07.716
The last thing that we want to do
is criticize it or make it feel different...

48:07.751 --> 48:10.481
just because it was born
with horrible deformities.

48:21.031 --> 48:24.262
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.

48:24.301 --> 48:25.325
- There's a fricking Cyclops...
- No, you got...

48:25.369 --> 48:27.428
...in your basement, man!
... a fucking thing, dude!

48:27.471 --> 48:28.665
You met Cyrus.

48:28.705 --> 48:29.899
- Cyrus.
- You named it?

48:29.940 --> 48:31.168
Our son.

48:31.208 --> 48:34.143
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asleep. I'm sorry.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.769
I thought you were joking...

48:35.812 --> 48:38.337
when you said you had an inbred son
who lives in your basement.

48:38.382 --> 48:40.009
Well, it ain't a joke.

48:40.050 --> 48:43.349
Raylene and I here are siblings,
and we get it on.

48:43.387 --> 48:45.685
But that don't mean
we ought to be judged.

48:45.722 --> 48:48.486
You boys must be awful tired
after what you've been through.

48:48.525 --> 48:49.958
Come with me,
I'll show you to your bed.

48:49.993 --> 48:52.018
You better go back to sleep, boy!

48:52.062 --> 48:55.054
Don't make me come down there
and whip your Cyclops ass!

48:57.367 --> 48:59.028
It's tough love.

48:59.069 --> 49:01.060
It's the best way.

49:18.855 --> 49:21.915
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag Colton.

49:21.958 --> 49:25.257
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?

49:25.295 --> 49:28.992
But it was agony pretending
his puny, little penis satisfied me.

49:29.032 --> 49:33.594
I bet. I bet you've been missing
the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

49:33.637 --> 49:35.901
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

49:35.939 --> 49:37.566
Yeah, you've been missing it?

49:37.607 --> 49:38.733
How much?

49:38.775 --> 49:41.676
- A lot.
- I bet.

49:42.679 --> 49:44.476
Well...

49:44.514 --> 49:48.143
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?

49:48.185 --> 49:52.246
I thought it'd be kinda cool
to bring somebody else in bed with us.

49:53.457 --> 49:55.322
Who?

49:55.358 --> 49:57.087
Hey, baby.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.028
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

50:05.068 --> 50:07.866
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?

50:07.904 --> 50:08.928
Let's do it.

50:08.972 --> 50:11.463
# There's something #
# About that woman #

50:11.508 --> 50:14.909
# She's got something
you can't live without #

50:14.945 --> 50:17.709
# Makes your heart sing #

50:17.747 --> 50:19.339
Faster, Weedy.

50:19.382 --> 50:21.441
# Something about that woman #

50:21.485 --> 50:24.943
# If you're in doubt
then you are missing out #

50:24.988 --> 50:27.479
# On a good thing #

50:28.492 --> 50:30.756
# I got to give it up #

50:30.794 --> 50:33.524
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

50:35.966 --> 50:37.661
- Weedy!
- Yeah?

50:37.701 --> 50:40.568
- Yeah!
- You like that?

50:49.079 --> 50:50.910
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

50:53.917 --> 50:54.941
Yeah, how about that?

50:54.985 --> 50:57.044
# Something about that woman #

50:57.087 --> 51:00.523
# She's got something
you can't live without #

51:00.557 --> 51:02.525
# Makes your heart sing #

51:04.261 --> 51:06.991
# It's just something about that woman #

51:07.030 --> 51:10.693
# If you're in doubt
then you are missing out #

51:10.734 --> 51:13.294
# On a good thing #

51:14.070 --> 51:15.833
# I got to give it up #

51:21.811 --> 51:23.073
Wow.

51:28.084 --> 51:29.483
Dude.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.581
I just had the most
fucked-up nightmare.

51:32.622 --> 51:36.683
Come on, man.
I was having a really hot dream.

51:36.726 --> 51:39.388
Go back to bed, please, dude.

52:11.261 --> 52:13.964
<i>Why did we have to leave?
Their Goonies child was kind of cute.</i>

52:13.999 --> 52:16.489
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

52:16.533 --> 52:18.626
Jesus, every time the two of us
try to get anywhere...

52:18.668 --> 52:21.364
it's fucking disaster
after fucking disaster.

52:21.404 --> 52:23.167
Jesus, dude.
Here, you really need a hit of this.

52:23.206 --> 52:25.800
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

52:25.842 --> 52:28.140
It's your solution to everything,
you know that?

52:28.178 --> 52:31.147
Think about it.
We should be at Colton's already.

52:31.181 --> 52:34.446
Hey, chill, we still have two days
to fuck up the wedding.

52:34.484 --> 52:36.543
- What?
- What?

52:37.053 --> 52:38.645
- What?
- What?

52:39.089 --> 52:43.423
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.

52:43.460 --> 52:46.793
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!

52:47.230 --> 52:49.323
Colton is the only guy
that can help us out at this point.

52:49.366 --> 52:51.994
I can't believe... I cannot believe
you're willing to fuck that up!

52:52.035 --> 52:53.935
I just hate that fucking asshole, OK?

52:53.970 --> 52:56.734
Yeah? I like him better
than I like you right now.

52:56.773 --> 52:58.968
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.000
You know what he got me? A job.

53:01.044 --> 53:04.980
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantànamo Bay.

53:05.015 --> 53:06.710
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.

53:06.750 --> 53:09.583
You're jealous because Vanessa
found somebody better than you.

53:09.619 --> 53:11.177
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

53:11.221 --> 53:13.815
Better than you! Let me think.

53:13.857 --> 53:17.349
Potential future president,
or unemployed pothead?

53:17.394 --> 53:19.919
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

53:19.963 --> 53:22.261
Yeah, well at least
Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...

53:22.299 --> 53:24.130
getting plowed
by a bunch of European dudes.

53:25.302 --> 53:26.769
- What?
- Do you really think Maria's...

53:26.803 --> 53:28.270
saving herself for you, dude?

53:28.305 --> 53:30.239
Right now, she's probably got
two uncircumcised dicks...

53:30.273 --> 53:31.365
dangling in front of her throat.

53:31.408 --> 53:34.866
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsils?

53:39.249 --> 53:41.342
Fucking dick.

53:44.654 --> 53:47.020
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.

53:49.392 --> 53:51.053
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

53:51.461 --> 53:52.951
Asshole!

53:52.996 --> 53:55.829
Don't you dare say a fucking word
about my angel!

53:58.301 --> 54:00.132
What the fuck was that?

54:00.170 --> 54:02.229
Get up. Get up!

54:02.272 --> 54:04.240
Fuck you.

54:13.450 --> 54:15.042
Shit.

54:18.588 --> 54:21.523
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

54:21.558 --> 54:22.718
Yeah.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.994
Yeah, I think it is.

54:26.796 --> 54:28.991
Maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

54:29.032 --> 54:31.057
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.433
Let's do that.

54:36.406 --> 54:39.239
<i>The other day, caught a rerun
of that show Becker.</i>

54:39.275 --> 54:40.708
You know that show?

54:40.744 --> 54:44.180
Yeah, that's the one
with that Jew, Ted Danson.

54:44.214 --> 54:47.650
That blond negro they got on there,
he had me in stitches.

54:47.684 --> 54:49.242
He's actually pretty funny.

54:49.285 --> 54:51.515
Really? You think so?

54:51.554 --> 54:54.352
I'm not saying I wouldn't
lynch the guy, but...

54:54.391 --> 54:57.189
his timing, it's priceless.

54:57.927 --> 55:00.225
Hold up a second.

55:00.263 --> 55:02.925
I gotta go drain the main vein.

55:19.916 --> 55:22.111
I'll tell ya, Travis...

55:22.152 --> 55:24.518
when it comes to feeling good...

55:24.554 --> 55:27.580
I'd rate pissin' right up there
with comin' and shittin'.

55:29.626 --> 55:31.184
I like to do all three.

55:31.227 --> 55:32.455
Yeah, I hear ya.

55:34.664 --> 55:37.758
Kenny, come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up.

55:38.701 --> 55:42.102
You were the one who made me
drink that third beer.

55:42.138 --> 55:44.572
Hold your horses, peckerwood.

55:45.442 --> 55:47.842
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

55:47.877 --> 55:50.175
- You racist fuck!
- What the heck?

55:56.953 --> 55:58.978
What the nigger was that?

56:01.024 --> 56:03.618
This is fucked. We are fucked.

56:03.660 --> 56:05.560
Kenny. Travis.

56:07.096 --> 56:09.758
What in the tarnation you guys doin'?

56:09.799 --> 56:11.960
Good, you brought the keg.
Lug that thing over.

56:12.001 --> 56:13.366
- Let's go! Come on!
- Come on!

56:13.403 --> 56:15.667
Let's go, come on!

56:26.983 --> 56:29.713
Yeah, then you put little onions on 'em
and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

56:29.752 --> 56:33.347
Roldy, dude, I'd never thought
I'd say this in a million years...

56:33.389 --> 56:34.981
but the Klan really knows how to party.

56:35.024 --> 56:36.855
You gotta try these dogs.

56:36.893 --> 56:37.882
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

56:37.927 --> 56:40.623
Really know how to...
the Klan knows how to party?

56:40.663 --> 56:42.688
- Dude, we've got to get out of here!
- Jeez, all right, dude, relax.

56:42.732 --> 56:46.190
All right, y'all! Come on over here
and we'll sit around the campfire.

56:46.236 --> 56:48.704
- Shit, what do we do?
- Let's go sit down.

56:48.738 --> 56:49.966
Rufus. Next to them marshmallows...

56:50.006 --> 56:52.236
- and the graham crackers.
- Everybody sit down.

56:52.275 --> 56:54.800
Best s'mores we've had in a long time...

56:54.844 --> 56:57.039
that's what I'm talking about,
that's what I'm talking about.

56:57.080 --> 57:00.811
Now. Now I want
each one of y'all to tell me...

57:00.850 --> 57:03.478
somethin'... Porch monkey, kike!

57:03.520 --> 57:06.421
...that you did
to a minority this week. Yeah.

57:06.456 --> 57:08.549
I tripped a beaner while I was
walking down the stairs...

57:08.591 --> 57:10.821
at the Wal-Mart the other day.

57:11.928 --> 57:13.691
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottles.

57:14.430 --> 57:16.557
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

57:19.302 --> 57:21.099
All right, all right, let's all calm down.

57:21.137 --> 57:24.163
White power here, white power here,
white power here.

57:25.141 --> 57:27.006
Giving him what he deserves.

57:27.043 --> 57:28.340
Hebe!

57:30.346 --> 57:32.837
All right, I'm back. Next.

57:32.882 --> 57:35.009
It better be good. Here.

57:39.155 --> 57:41.419
Come on, dude, say something.

57:43.826 --> 57:45.623
You know what?

57:47.297 --> 57:49.288
I did knee an Indian guy in the balls.

57:49.332 --> 57:50.356
That's funny!

57:52.035 --> 57:54.367
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

57:54.437 --> 57:58.533
Well, you want to hear something real
fucked-up and awesome that I did?

57:58.575 --> 58:03.308
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush
and I rubbed it all over my dick.

58:03.346 --> 58:07.282
- You did that?
- Well, that's just downright disgustin'.

58:07.317 --> 58:09.080
- But I like it!
- Yeah!

58:10.253 --> 58:12.551
Yeah, I love bein' white.

58:13.790 --> 58:16.725
- What the...
- Look what we got us here, brothers.

58:20.096 --> 58:22.291
Mexicans!

58:22.332 --> 58:24.994
Lynch 'em!

58:25.034 --> 58:26.296
Come on, come on! Come on!

58:29.072 --> 58:32.235
Come on, boys, let's chase them
back to the border!

58:33.676 --> 58:34.665
Pussy fart!

58:37.480 --> 58:39.914
Holy shit!

58:39.949 --> 58:41.883
Should we put it out or what?

58:44.187 --> 58:46.052
Are they still behind us?

58:46.089 --> 58:49.081
I don't think so.
Dude, the Klan is fucking slow.

58:51.828 --> 58:54.228
Hey, flag down this car.

58:54.263 --> 58:56.959
Help! Help! Help!

58:58.468 --> 59:00.834
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:02.171 --> 59:03.399
# Yeah #

59:03.439 --> 59:04.906
Thanks for stopping.

59:04.941 --> 59:05.930
# You better check yo self #

59:05.975 --> 59:07.237
No problem.

59:07.276 --> 59:09.005
# 'Cause I'm bad for your health,
I come real stealth #

59:09.045 --> 59:10.535
Neil?

59:10.580 --> 59:13.105
Gary and Kumar!

59:13.149 --> 59:14.207
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

59:14.250 --> 59:15.239
Harold. Harold.

59:15.284 --> 59:16.774
Sorry, man. I forgot.

59:18.988 --> 59:21.115
What are you doing here, man?

59:21.157 --> 59:24.615
This is where God took me.
What are you guys doing out here?

59:24.661 --> 59:27.152
We're actually trying to get to Texas.

59:27.196 --> 59:28.561
That's where I'm headed!

59:30.099 --> 59:31.088
What are the odds?

59:32.001 --> 59:32.990
Let's get out of here.

59:33.036 --> 59:34.594
- All right.
- Thank you.

59:35.271 --> 59:36.260
Shrooms?

59:36.305 --> 59:38.603
- No. Thanks, though.
- No, thank you.

59:38.641 --> 59:40.472
Suit yourself.

59:45.148 --> 59:47.173
Gentlemen, start your engines.

59:47.984 --> 59:50.316
It's gonna be a bumpy fuckin' ride.

59:50.353 --> 59:52.253
# 'Cause shotgun bullets
are bad for your health #

59:57.160 --> 59:59.628
We found their phone.

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:03.124
Lee and Patel made a phone call to you.

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:07.196
Now tell us everything you know
about their terrorist plot.

01:00:07.236 --> 01:00:10.262
Terrorist plot? Rold and Kumar?

01:00:10.306 --> 01:00:12.536
This is ridiculous.

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.135
OK, fine. Fine.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:17.738
Mr. Rosenberg.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.613
Mr. Gold-stein.

01:00:21.551 --> 01:00:23.644
We'll do it your way.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:30.721
What's this? What do we have here?

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:59.315
It's about seven dollars?

01:00:59.355 --> 01:01:01.016
Look, don't insult us, all right?

01:01:01.057 --> 01:01:02.524
I don't know
what the hell is going on here...

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:05.288
but I'm pleading the Fifth
until I speak to my lawyer.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.592
You're pleading the Fifth, huh?

01:01:08.731 --> 01:01:10.699
Beecher, give me a copy
of the Bill of Rights.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:12.257
The Bill of Rights? Why?

01:01:12.301 --> 01:01:14.360
Just do it!

01:01:14.403 --> 01:01:16.337
Excuse me.

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:19.563
Five, right?

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:20.906
- Five alive.
- Sure.

01:01:20.943 --> 01:01:23.503
OK. OK. Good.

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:29.282
You wanna know what I think
about the Fifth Amendment?

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.226
There it is.

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:47.734
That's what I think
of the Fifth Amendment.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:53.369
Why the hell is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:56.970
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to, buddy.

01:01:57.013 --> 01:01:58.002
What do ya got?

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:01.107
Turns out the FBI was already
tapping Mr. Goldstein's phone.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:02.913
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.284
You were tapping my phone?

01:02:05.321 --> 01:02:06.310
You want to hear the tape?

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:10.587
No. I'm sick of listening
to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:13.094
Lee and Patel are on their way
to Texas as we speak.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.290
I knew they'd trip up.

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:19.131
Ready the plane.
These fuckers are goin' down.

01:02:26.175 --> 01:02:29.804
Neil, can you just focus on driving?
You've had... Focus on the road.

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:32.406
You've had dozens of shrooms,
my friend.

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:36.176
Dude, I was able to perform
an appendectomy at age 14.

01:02:36.219 --> 01:02:39.382
I think I can handle
a couple mushrooms.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.949
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:45.790
Did you see that unicorn?

01:02:45.828 --> 01:02:47.591
Its horn was so shiny.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:52.090
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

01:02:52.134 --> 01:02:55.035
Let's just say
my ex-girlfriend's getting married.

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:00.242
The one that got away, huh?

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:01.937
Yep.

01:03:01.978 --> 01:03:03.969
Sounds to me like you need a drink.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:07.112
Road. Neil, please,
can you pay attention...

01:03:07.149 --> 01:03:09.083
Dude, I've got it!

01:03:09.118 --> 01:03:12.019
- Yeah, but...
- He's a good driver. Stop.

01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:15.114
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

01:03:15.157 --> 01:03:16.283
Really? Drinking?

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.692
I have a lost-love story of my own.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:26.724
Yeah?

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:29.700
<i>Happened on the set of C/ara's Heart.</i>

01:03:29.739 --> 01:03:31.229
Sure, sure, yeah.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:34.766
I'll never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.

01:03:34.810 --> 01:03:36.641
She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:40.672
Her skin was so soft,
her lips were so sweet.

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:46.687
She had these tiny,
little Hershey Kiss nipples...

01:03:47.456 --> 01:03:50.584
that you just wanted
to suck on all night long.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:54.358
Anyway, last day of shooting, I told her.

01:03:54.397 --> 01:03:56.160
I said...

01:03:56.198 --> 01:03:59.929
"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up. "

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.561
Why did you do that?

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.473
I didn't think I could take on
that kind of responsibility.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:10.068
It was such a big mistake.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.444
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone...

01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:14.813
couldn't you have sex
with whoever you wanted?

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.044
Let me be clear.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:17.950
There is nothing on the planet...

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.285
that I love more than a hot, new pussy.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:21.847
- Sure.
- Nothing.

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.984
What does the P.H. Stands for in N.P.H.?

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:26.353
Patrick Harris.

01:04:26.395 --> 01:04:29.023
No, common mistake. Poon handler.

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:31.593
The point is, boys...

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:36.230
even though I love havin' sex
with some hot, random trim...

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:41.232
a day hasn't gone by
where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:47.413
Every time I see a bag of
Hershey's Kisses, my balls get so wet.

01:04:52.488 --> 01:04:54.513
Here's to you, Tashonda.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:58.853
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:27.914
# Free on my own #

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:31.017
# That's the way I used to be #

01:05:31.060 --> 01:05:32.618
# But since I met you, baby #

01:05:32.661 --> 01:05:34.822
Hey, honey.
What's up?

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:37.492
I found something in your purse.

01:05:38.367 --> 01:05:39.834
Why would you go through my purse?

01:05:39.869 --> 01:05:41.530
Why would you have a joint...

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:44.664
when you know
it could ruin my political career?

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.765
I'm sorry.

01:05:45.808 --> 01:05:50.074
What with all the wedding plans,
I've just been a little stressed.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:52.046
It helps me relax?

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.539
Marijuana is illegal, Vanessa.

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.415
Now, I thought that part of your life
was in the past.

01:05:57.453 --> 01:05:59.887
- It is.
- Good.

01:06:01.257 --> 01:06:02.349
That's all I need to hear.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:07.792
Hey, baby.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:11.163
Look, I know things can be hectic
with the wedding.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:15.569
But, you know, if you get stressed out,
just do what I do.

01:06:15.604 --> 01:06:17.629
Snort Zoloft, OK?

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:27.545
What the fuck?

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:28.572
Shit.

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:32.075
Dude, they set up a fucking roadblock!
They're gonna find us.

01:06:32.121 --> 01:06:33.918
- What are you talking about?
- Neil...

01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:36.151
I don't know how to say this
any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:37.784
Cool.

01:06:39.128 --> 01:06:41.426
OK, well, we've got to find a way
to get out of this.

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:43.091
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please.

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:47.034
You act like I've never smuggled
a fugitive across state lines before.

01:06:47.069 --> 01:06:49.367
Here. Hide in that.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.771
Sorry. It's a little sticky.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.973
Shit.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.340
Yeah.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:06.714
What the... When were you
gonna show me these?

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.898
Excuse me.

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:18.826
Wait, Officer!

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:22.202
- Shit.
- Hold that car!

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:40.088
Neil Patrick Harris.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:42.414
Yo.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.659
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

01:07:47.696 --> 01:07:50.187
Yeah. I would imagine so.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.168
I'm sure you get this all the time...

01:07:54.203 --> 01:08:01.075
<i>but your part in Starship Troopers
truly, truly changed my life.</i>

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:02.407
Really?

01:08:02.444 --> 01:08:04.241
How?

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:09.479
Well, no one thought the war against
the arachnids of Klendathu could be won.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:10.951
- But you showed the starship troopers...
- Neil!

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:12.920
...that those bugs could be destroyed.

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:19.423
A lot of people think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:23.288
That's why I joined
the Department of Homeland Security.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:27.962
<i>My friend, two words.
Starship fuckin' Troopers.</i>

01:08:28.002 --> 01:08:32.201
If you want to know the secret of being,
you will come with us.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.567
Please. I really need to go.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:39.479
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry
to bother you. You move along.

01:08:42.685 --> 01:08:44.653
Bye.

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.652
I love you.

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.723
I love you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.389
What the...

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.567
Holy fucking shit, that was awesome.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.666
Try having that conversation
on shrooms.

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:08.573
I deserve an Oscar
for that performance.

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:09.600
- You do!
- Dudes...

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.510
I'm gonna take a little detour
on the way, all right?

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:12.536
- No.
- Neil, no.

01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.569
But we're almost there, man.

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.743
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do...

01:09:15.783 --> 01:09:18.719
I'm going to a whorehouse
and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:23.282
If you two don't want to get
your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:26.120
I'll get my dick wet.

01:09:32.201 --> 01:09:36.501
# Don't need nothin' but a good time #

01:09:36.537 --> 01:09:39.166
# How can I resist? #

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:43.144
# Ain't lookin' for nothin'
but a good time #

01:09:43.178 --> 01:09:47.011
# And it don't get better than this #

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.883
Pussy, I'm home!

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:52.386
Hello?

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:58.353
Well, well, well. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:01.158
What's the matter, Sally? I thought
I was one of your top customers.

01:10:01.196 --> 01:10:04.290
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you were here?

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:07.568
Because of you, my best girl quit.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.400
Hey, I paid her good money.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:11.065
It's not my fault
she didn't lube up.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.803
Besides, I bring you new customers.

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:17.971
- New customers?
- No, Neil, that's all.

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:20.038
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

01:10:20.082 --> 01:10:22.312
Sally. Bring on the lineup.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.045
Line up in the chutes, girls.

01:10:27.089 --> 01:10:29.922
Longhorns coming through.

01:10:29.958 --> 01:10:31.050
Neil.

01:10:34.997 --> 01:10:37.830
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:39.731
Hello, ba...

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:43.633
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.

01:10:43.672 --> 01:10:45.230
How'd you come up with that?

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.208
Well, I have huge tits.

01:10:47.242 --> 01:10:49.642
<i>And my favorite book
is A Moveab/e Feast.</i>

01:10:49.678 --> 01:10:52.238
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:53.839
Well, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:56.180
'cause I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out...

01:10:56.218 --> 01:10:57.947
and you're gonna jam out
with your clam out.

01:10:57.986 --> 01:10:59.681
It's gonna be magical.

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:02.523
- The whores are on me, fellas.
- No, Neil...

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:04.355
- thank you, but we... that's...
- Thanks, dude.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.883
Screw that, Roldy.
I don't know about you...

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:09.295
but, no offense to the rest of you ladies,
I am gonna be taking you two.

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.966
No, Kumar. Kumar!

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.490
Roldy, you're missing out, brother.

01:11:14.403 --> 01:11:16.428
Yo, we need to get back on the road,
buddy.

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:17.905
We need...

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:24.345
Well, now, you know, we also supply...

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:28.009
in-room films or a magazine.

01:11:30.018 --> 01:11:32.646
Well, if you'd like
some self-satisfaction...

01:11:32.688 --> 01:11:34.781
we do have some...

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:38.891
electronic devices right over there.

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.925
Just have some coffee. Yeah?

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:47.800
Why don't you lie on the bed?

01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:50.327
And tell us what you want us to do.

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:52.738
OK. OK.

01:11:54.076 --> 01:11:55.703
Well...

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:59.077
how about...

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.550
How about you take off your clothes
and make out with each other?

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.984
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.

01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:06.112
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.918
# Pussy real good #

01:12:07.956 --> 01:12:09.617
# That pussy #
# Pussy real good #

01:12:09.658 --> 01:12:11.990
# That pussy #
# That pussy off the chain #

01:12:12.027 --> 01:12:14.188
# That pussy #
# Go on and do yo thang #

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:16.561
# That pussy #
# Pussy real good #

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:18.657
# That pussy #
# That pussy real good #

01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.634
# That pussy #

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:22.466
# Yo' mama don't like #

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.139
# She say I'm no good #

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:27.108
# What she don't know is #

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:29.474
# I got you pussy-whooped #

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:31.775
# He need this pussy #

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:34.078
# He smell this pussy #

01:12:34.116 --> 01:12:36.209
# He wanna taste this pussy #

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.651
# He gotta pay for pussy #

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:40.484
Can you use tongue?

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:42.752
# That pussy, pussy #

01:12:42.791 --> 01:12:44.452
# Pussy, pussy #

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:47.790
Bump your titty on her titty.

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.263
# Police pull me over #

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:51.289
# They don't write no tickets #

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:54.301
Boner achieved!

01:12:55.337 --> 01:12:58.864
Great. Now let's get those pants off.

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:00.238
OK.

01:13:00.776 --> 01:13:04.041
- You are benevolent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:04.079 --> 01:13:05.444
- Yeah?
- We get that a lot.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.310
Yeah. You know what that means,
benevolent?

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.941
Yeah, I do, actually.

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:10.246
What?

01:13:10.285 --> 01:13:12.446
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.854
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:18.018
That is exactly, exactly what it means.

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:21.995
You know what bothers me
the most, though?

01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:25.158
He never once apologized
for getting me into all this trouble.

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:30.194
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:33.675
But it's cool.
He doesn't know how to say "I'm sorry. "

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:35.906
Why do you think that is?

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:40.381
Sparkle, because it's all about
what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

01:13:40.415 --> 01:13:43.612
You know. I don't even care
because... You know...

01:13:43.652 --> 01:13:46.416
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

01:13:46.455 --> 01:13:48.616
- It's done.
- Don't say that.

01:13:49.057 --> 01:13:51.025
A good friend is hard to come by.

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.492
Venus, come on.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:55.759
Yeah, but if he was a real friend,
he would know how to say, "I'm sorry. "

01:13:55.831 --> 01:13:57.162
That's right.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.190
Thank you, Agnes.

01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:01.091
Nail on the head.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.062
It's like right now...

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:08.042
after all the shit that we have
been through in the last few days...

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:13.275
you know, he's in there having
the time of his life, having sex.

01:14:16.685 --> 01:14:19.176
I never should have left her.

01:14:19.755 --> 01:14:21.416
I don't even know...

01:14:21.456 --> 01:14:23.856
I don't even know what I was thinking.

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:26.725
I loved her so much.

01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:30.862
She was my little baby.

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.059
Why did I let my little baby go?

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:34.364
Why did I let her go?

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:36.303
You'll find someone else.

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.033
No, I won't. Not like Vanessa.

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:40.473
You'll find love again someday.

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.739
Yeah, you will.

01:14:43.345 --> 01:14:45.643
Did you guys?

01:14:47.215 --> 01:14:49.615
No, we're whores.

01:14:49.651 --> 01:14:51.949
- Remember?
- Yeah.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:14:59.791
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.625
What the hell is going on here?

01:15:01.663 --> 01:15:04.564
That prick fucking branded me!

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:06.991
- Stop it.
- I warned you, Neil.

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:09.469
Bring it.

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.836
- Neil! Neil!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.

01:15:11.873 --> 01:15:14.273
- What... Neil! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:15.298
- But...
- No, Neil.

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.811
Neil!

01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:20.147
- What about Neil, man?
- No, fuck Neil. He just fucked us.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:22.707
- Neil! Neil!
- Come on, come on, come on!

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:24.412
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Neil!

01:15:24.453 --> 01:15:25.920
Come on!

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:28.813
- N.P.H.!
- No!

01:15:30.626 --> 01:15:31.854
Stop! Stop!

01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.723
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get Neil.

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.424
- Why?
- Look, we're stealing his car!

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.332
- We can't leave him back there.
- He stole your fucking car last week!

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.996
What was that?

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:43.660
- Hurry up.
- Neil!

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.468
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.

01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:47.441
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Neil, Neil, come on! Come on, man!

01:15:47.476 --> 01:15:49.307
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

01:15:49.344 --> 01:15:50.811
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

01:15:50.846 --> 01:15:52.643
You can make it, dude.

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:56.139
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

01:15:57.052 --> 01:16:00.021
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:02.250
- Neil's dead! Neil's dead!
- No!

01:16:02.924 --> 01:16:06.860
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:15.626
# How do I say goodbye #

01:16:15.671 --> 01:16:17.400
It's the dawn of a new day.

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:22.335
And Neil Patrick Harris
isn't around to see it, man.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:23.366
Dude, I told you.

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.902
Will you please stop saying that?

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:27.471
God.

01:16:27.516 --> 01:16:29.984
He's gone.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.644
Maybe he's got
some family contact info in here.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.884
Dude, I know
I'm not calling Neil's parents.

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:38.750
What's in the bag?

01:16:38.794 --> 01:16:41.319
- Holy fuck.
- Creepy mask.

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.858
A jar with hair in it.

01:16:47.335 --> 01:16:50.395
And, like, 12 cans of Mace.

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.908
- Look, dude.
- Holy shit.

01:16:55.944 --> 01:16:58.310
Holy shit, we actually made it.

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.350
This is where Colton grew up, huh?

01:17:07.389 --> 01:17:09.687
Smell that? That smells like douche.

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:18.866
No, you will remain in this car.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:22.131
I will go inside alone and, if we're lucky,
Colton will help us out.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:26.072
- Why can't I just...
- No. Let me put it another way.

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:29.839
You leave this car,
and our friendship is over.

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:32.346
- But, Roldy, I just...
- Kumar.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:35.372
Open the door
and I will cut your fucking balls off.

01:17:35.417 --> 01:17:36.543
Jesus. OK.

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:42.279
- Balls.
- Go.

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:56.594
Hi, I'm a friend of Colton's.

01:17:56.638 --> 01:17:58.162
Thank you.

01:18:41.349 --> 01:18:42.646
God damn it.

01:18:42.684 --> 01:18:44.982
Vanessa? You OK?

01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:48.353
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, let me help you up.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:53.991
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

01:18:54.029 --> 01:18:56.691
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:58.961
You all right?

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.560
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.

01:19:01.603 --> 01:19:03.195
- It does?
- Yeah.

01:19:03.238 --> 01:19:07.140
This is just what I need.
A limp during the wedding.

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:09.370
Can you move it around in a circle?

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:13.575
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:17.176
So a little ice and massage
should do the trick. You'll be fine.

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:19.346
Are you gonna tell me why you're here?

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.378
Roldy and I ran into some trouble...

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:25.359
and we figured that maybe
your Colton could help us out.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:28.556
- Still getting into trouble, huh?
- A little bit.

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:31.589
You remember that time that
you broke into the animal lab...

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:34.659
and, like, stole that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:36.398
OK, first of all,
that was Goldstein's idea...

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.427
and second of all...

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:40.168
had I known that the monkey had AIDS,
I never would have done that.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:41.197
What about you?

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:44.679
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.271
- Remember that?
- Come on.

01:19:46.314 --> 01:19:47.713
She was a bitch and you know it.

01:19:51.553 --> 01:19:53.885
What's going on here?

01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:56.914
Hey, she actually fell
and broke her heel here.

01:19:56.958 --> 01:20:01.190
Yeah, I twisted my ankle.
Kumar was just looking at it.

01:20:01.229 --> 01:20:03.288
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yell.

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.923
I thought I told you
to stay in the car, man.

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.897
It's OK, man.

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:08.425
No worries.

01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:11.064
Listen, Roldy filled me in
on the situation.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.870
But don't worry. I'll make sure
my dad takes care of everything.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.032
Thanks, man.

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:19.069
In the meantime,
you are going to the doctor.

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:21.241
Ramòn!

01:20:21.283 --> 01:20:25.617
Ramòn. Please bring Vanessa
to Dr. Harris immediately.

01:20:27.022 --> 01:20:30.082
Bye, Vanessa. Hope you feel better.

01:20:31.259 --> 01:20:34.660
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:38.833
Guys.

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:40.300
All right.

01:20:42.103 --> 01:20:45.595
All right, guys. Jet's all fueled.
You should be home in no time.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.039
Sweet.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.611
Hey, Colton, I can't believe
you're doing this for us...

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.708
on the night before your wedding day.

01:20:56.751 --> 01:21:00.380
- I really appreciate it. Thank you.
- Please don't mention it.

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:03.289
Just want to make sure
everything works out smoothly.

01:21:03.325 --> 01:21:04.952
Are all these planes yours?

01:21:04.993 --> 01:21:07.291
No. OK.

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:08.921
Rold, come on, of course they are.

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.458
This guy's funny. You're funny.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.661
- Yeah?
- Hey, Colton, man.

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:18.965
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude.
You're not a douchebag.

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.167
Dude.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.835
You know what I mean.
I mean, you're a good dude.

01:21:21.876 --> 01:21:24.037
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.612
That's big of you, Kumar.

01:21:28.650 --> 01:21:30.515
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.713
I just can't wait to get back, man.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:37.388
You're going back all right.

01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.288
This time you're not escaping.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.989
Now!

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.497
Go! Move, move, move!

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.629
You are a douchebag...

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:53.038
- No.
... you fucking douchebag, fuck you!

01:21:53.074 --> 01:21:55.907
Yeah. The last thing I was letting
you guys do is ruin my wedding.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:58.674
- You did this?
- Of course he did this.

01:21:58.713 --> 01:22:01.147
I thought we were friends, man.
How could you betray me like this?

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:03.173
Come on, Rold. You and me?

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:05.243
You let me cheat off you
in Advanced Accounting.

01:22:05.286 --> 01:22:06.981
Other than that,
I could give a shit about you.

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.421
Take 'em away, guys.

01:22:08.923 --> 01:22:11.357
When we get out of this I'm gonna
fucking kick your fucking ass, man!

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.054
Boy, you're scaring me.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.289
Well, come on, you're not
one of those kung-fu Asians...

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:17.696
you're a fucking pussy banker,
for Christ's sakes.

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.825
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!

01:22:19.868 --> 01:22:22.496
- You'd best watch your back, bitch!
- Fuck you, dude!

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:24.732
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

01:22:25.673 --> 01:22:27.834
I'm awesome.

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:35.748
Looks like you boys picked
the wrong side, huh?

01:22:35.784 --> 01:22:38.218
Where's your Koran now?

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.818
We're not even Muslim, you moron...

01:22:40.855 --> 01:22:44.086
and even if we were,
that doesn't make us terrorists.

01:22:44.325 --> 01:22:46.725
Hey! I'm talking to you.
Get back here!

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:50.857
# Metal under tension
beggin' you to touch and go #

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.767
# Highway to #

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:58.697
Man. I can't believe we're going back.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:00.867
Now do you see
why I hate Colton Graham?

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:03.537
Now do you see why I hate you?

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:07.003
I asked you specifically
to stay in the car.

01:23:07.048 --> 01:23:09.710
I told you our friendship was at stake.

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:11.275
Vanessa fell down.
And I was helping her.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.344
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!

01:23:13.388 --> 01:23:14.616
I don't want to hear the excuses!

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:16.419
- I heard her yelling!
- I don't want to hear it.

01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:24.594
I'm sorry.

01:23:25.433 --> 01:23:26.730
'Kay?

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:29.235
Look at this. Look at this.

01:23:30.271 --> 01:23:32.398
I fucked up, OK?

01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:36.206
I fucked up and I always fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.

01:23:36.244 --> 01:23:37.609
You think?

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.103
Harold...

01:23:41.116 --> 01:23:42.413
you're my best friend, dude.

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:46.117
You mean the world to me, man.
I love you.

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.143
Queers.

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:48.212
And I promise you, if we figure out...

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.520
a way to get out of this,
I'm gonna change, OK?

01:23:50.558 --> 01:23:52.492
It's not just gonna be
about Kumar all the time.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:55.325
It'll be about Kumar and Harold.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:23:59.725
Harold and Kumar.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.800
I kind of like the first way better.

01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:05.203
OK, OK. Harold and Kumar.

01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:06.764
Harold and Kumar.

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:12.604
# The hotter the intensity #

01:24:13.915 --> 01:24:15.644
It's not all your fault.

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:19.643
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the plane.

01:24:19.687 --> 01:24:22.815
- You got weed?
- No. The other plane.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.858
No, I wish Neil Patrick Harris
were still alive, that guy fucking loves him.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.662
He totally would have
been able to bail us out.

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.401
You just gave me an idea, man.

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:38.037
- What?
- I got this.

01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:41.771
Hey, Burl...

01:24:41.809 --> 01:24:44.835
- I actually still have some weed.
- You do?

01:24:44.879 --> 01:24:47.507
- Seriously?
- Yeah. It's in my pants.

01:24:47.549 --> 01:24:49.574
- Hold up.
- You want to smoke now?

01:24:49.617 --> 01:24:50.777
Just let me...

01:24:50.818 --> 01:24:52.046
- Harold, this is definitely not...
... get it.

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:53.075
...the time to smoke.

01:24:56.291 --> 01:25:01.160
# Highway to the danger zone #

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:06.356
# Gonna take you
right into the danger zone #

01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:14.499
# Highway to the danger zone #

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:18.108
Dude, you took Neil's Mace?

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:20.512
Been through a lot of shit,
figured we might need it.

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:21.537
Well, good call.

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:28.021
Derek, can I get another water?

01:25:28.056 --> 01:25:30.183
What the fuck?

01:25:32.093 --> 01:25:33.993
- Keep your hands up.
- Please don't shoot us.

01:25:34.028 --> 01:25:36.258
- Jesus Christ. OK, OK.
- Please don't shoot.

01:25:36.297 --> 01:25:40.393
It will be a cold day in hell
before I let you hijack this plane.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.273
Beecher, what are you doing?

01:25:46.307 --> 01:25:48.901
Whose side are you on? I thought
I told you to stay in the cockpit!

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:51.741
Enough, Fox!
I've had enough of your crap!

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.303
You think that just because I'm smart...

01:25:53.348 --> 01:25:56.784
you can treat me
like some dork in gym class?

01:25:56.818 --> 01:26:00.618
It's obvious these kids are innocent.
But you're too dumb to realize that.

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:03.419
You know, it's people like you...

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.722
who make the world think
that Americans are stupid!

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.288
Well, we're not stupid! And we're not
gonna take this shit anymore!

01:26:12.433 --> 01:26:14.458
It's OK, guys.

01:26:14.502 --> 01:26:15.901
It's all over now.

01:26:16.704 --> 01:26:18.797
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:24.873
Jesus!

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.250
Fuck!

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.254
I don't wanna die!

01:26:34.289 --> 01:26:35.483
Kumar!

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:38.151
- What?
- I have the parachute!

01:26:38.192 --> 01:26:39.523
Come over here.

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.290
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:43.820
Swim!

01:26:51.239 --> 01:26:52.706
Holy shit.

01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:54.833
It's fucking working!

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.482
Yeah!

01:27:02.817 --> 01:27:04.682
I love you, dude.

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:10.519
Shit!

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:14.627
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:16.960
- What?
- Hang on.

01:27:22.503 --> 01:27:24.471
Fuck you!

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:31.207
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

01:27:32.613 --> 01:27:34.808
It was.

01:27:37.251 --> 01:27:38.946
- Kumar?
- Yeah.

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:43.153
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

01:27:44.659 --> 01:27:46.820
Yeah, I guess they are.

01:27:46.861 --> 01:27:49.159
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:54.234
Roldy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:58.066
I have no idea what I'm doing.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:06.540
Dude!

01:28:09.317 --> 01:28:13.151
The glass hurt my dick.
The glass hurt my dick.

01:28:15.223 --> 01:28:17.191
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

01:28:18.259 --> 01:28:20.591
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:28:20.628 --> 01:28:23.392
- No, shit, dude. You all right?
- Fuck! I think so!

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:25.695
We gotta get out of here before
the people who live here find us.

01:28:25.733 --> 01:28:27.360
I know. They're gonna be...

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.063
Dude? Dude?

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:32.436
What's up?

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:39.605
- No.
- Holy shit!

01:28:39.647 --> 01:28:42.582
What the hell are y'all
doing in my office?

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:46.343
You'd better start giving me
some answers!

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:48.514
George?
We're gonna be late for that wedding.

01:28:48.556 --> 01:28:51.923
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. Follow me.

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:55.292
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

01:28:55.329 --> 01:28:58.093
- Come the fuck on.
- I'm coming.

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.316
# Yeah #

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:21.546
- This is a cool room.
- Yeah.

01:29:21.589 --> 01:29:25.320
Yeah, this is where
I come to escape from work.

01:29:25.359 --> 01:29:28.021
- Here?
- Yes, sir.

01:29:29.497 --> 01:29:32.591
- So who the heck are you guys?
- All right.

01:29:32.633 --> 01:29:34.328
My name is Harold Lee, sir...

01:29:34.368 --> 01:29:35.960
and this is Kumar Patel.

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:41.970
Anyway, we were on a parachute
and we sort of landed on your ranch.

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:43.670
Dude, this is weed.

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:46.240
That's Alabama Kush.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:47.542
That's only the finest.

01:29:47.582 --> 01:29:50.278
So you get high and then you put
other people who smoke weed in jail?

01:29:51.519 --> 01:29:52.816
- That's so hypocritical.
- Dude, look...

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:55.721
Yeah? Well, let me ask you
something, Kumar.

01:29:55.756 --> 01:29:58.316
- You like giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.

01:29:58.359 --> 01:30:01.055
- You like getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.

01:30:01.095 --> 01:30:04.189
All right. Well, that makes you
a fucking hypocriticizer too.

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.565
So shut the fuck up
and smoke my weed.

01:30:24.619 --> 01:30:25.608
Hey, love.

01:30:25.653 --> 01:30:30.090
What are you doing here? It's bad luck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.

01:30:30.124 --> 01:30:31.921
I just want to let you know...

01:30:31.959 --> 01:30:34.052
I had catering get an extra case
of Coors Light...

01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:35.084
in case the President comes.

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:36.460
It's his favorite beer.

01:30:36.497 --> 01:30:39.432
- Do you think that'll be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?

01:30:39.467 --> 01:30:41.196
Who cares?

01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:46.230
Look, were you able to work
everything out with Kumar and Harold?

01:30:46.274 --> 01:30:49.607
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took complete care of 'em.

01:30:57.885 --> 01:31:00.547
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:04.819
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantànamo Bay.

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:07.589
Fuck! G. Bay?

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:10.355
Tell me you didn't eat
that cockmeat sandwich.

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:15.831
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:19.271
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.

01:31:19.307 --> 01:31:20.501
Oh, my God.

01:31:22.076 --> 01:31:24.738
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:26.747
- I laced it with blow.
- Fuck.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:29.579
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you
going at the same time.

01:31:31.118 --> 01:31:34.417
If you like weed so much,
why don't you just legalize it?

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:36.616
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:39.683
You know how pissed off
my dad would get if I did that?

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:41.991
Holy shit, dude.

01:31:42.029 --> 01:31:44.327
My dad's all up in my shit too,
about this whole...

01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:45.354
- med school thing, right?
- I know.

01:31:45.399 --> 01:31:47.663
And it's not that I don't
want to be a doctor, but like...

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:51.263
fucking... sometimes I wonder
if he's just encouraging me...

01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:52.795
because he knows it'll make me happy...

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.799
or because he wants me
to carry on his legacy, you know?

01:31:57.878 --> 01:31:59.937
You just blew my fuckin' mind.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:13.686
- Hi.
- Hi. You look good.

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.719
Daddy.

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.390
Yeah, it's W.

01:32:19.266 --> 01:32:21.700
I don't need your friends
to tell me what to do anymore.

01:32:23.371 --> 01:32:26.033
- No, I'm not being disrespectful.
- That's what I say.

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:29.008
I'm just saying that
I can handle my own shit, all right?

01:32:29.043 --> 01:32:31.978
I mean, I don't need them to tell me
how to do what I have to do.

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:33.878
Yeah, dude!

01:32:33.914 --> 01:32:36.712
Yeah, well you know what?
Yeah, well, fuck you, Dad.

01:32:36.751 --> 01:32:38.844
Fuck you!

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.887
- Dude, that was awesome.
- You guys are awesome.

01:32:43.924 --> 01:32:44.913
- No. No.
- You're awesome!

01:32:44.959 --> 01:32:47.587
- You are awesomer.
- Sir, you are awesome.

01:32:47.628 --> 01:32:49.095
Seriously.

01:32:49.130 --> 01:32:51.928
Listen, about our situation...

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:56.494
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, all right?

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:59.267
That means I get to pardon whoever
I want. You guys are in the fuckin' clear.

01:32:59.306 --> 01:33:00.364
Don't worry.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:04.538
- Holy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:05.602
Yeah.

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:08.911
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:13.714
But, listen, to be honest, after
all the shit that we've been through...

01:33:13.754 --> 01:33:17.747
I don't know if we can trust
our government anymore.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:19.851
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:22.795
Heck. I'm in the government
and I don't even trust it.

01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:27.233
You don't have to believe in your
government to be a good American.

01:33:31.338 --> 01:33:33.602
You just have to believe in your country.

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:35.865
Exactly.

01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:38.242
- Exactly.
- Right.

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:39.940
This is good shit, isn't it?

01:33:41.615 --> 01:33:43.310
Yeah, it is.

01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:46.877
If you guys need anything else,
just let me know, all right?

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:50.379
Actually, Mr. President,
there is one thing.

01:33:52.426 --> 01:33:54.951
- This really came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:56.724
I lit a lot of these candles.

01:34:10.177 --> 01:34:11.735
Great.

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:16.278
- All clear.
- Safe to proceed.

01:34:17.651 --> 01:34:19.516
He's here! I knew he'd come.

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:25.324
All right, let 'em in.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.358
- What is happen...
- Who is that?

01:34:31.398 --> 01:34:34.026
- Harold?
- Kumar?

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:38.300
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize
for interrupting this beautiful ceremony.

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:40.068
But there is no way in hell...

01:34:40.107 --> 01:34:43.008
that I'm letting the only woman
I've ever loved marry that piece of shit.

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:47.246
Security, get them out of here, please.

01:34:47.281 --> 01:34:50.808
These guys?
No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

01:34:50.851 --> 01:34:53.843
Looks like I got a little more pull
with the President than you, bitch.

01:34:56.924 --> 01:35:00.018
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

01:35:00.060 --> 01:35:02.654
Your fiancé promised
to get us out of trouble.

01:35:02.696 --> 01:35:06.496
But instead he arranged for us
to be sent back to Guantànamo Bay...

01:35:06.534 --> 01:35:09.970
where we'd be forced
to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

01:35:13.174 --> 01:35:15.301
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.

01:35:15.342 --> 01:35:17.071
I'll take care of this myself.

01:35:19.547 --> 01:35:20.639
- OK, wait.
- No...

01:35:23.050 --> 01:35:24.517
You son of a bitch.

01:35:26.353 --> 01:35:27.877
I loved you, man.

01:35:31.959 --> 01:35:34.519
- I can't believe this.
- Vanessa, let me explain...

01:35:34.562 --> 01:35:36.462
Explain?

01:35:36.497 --> 01:35:37.862
Explain why you're putting me through...

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:40.264
the most embarrassing moment
of my life?

01:35:41.769 --> 01:35:46.866
Well, what if I did
something embarrassing to myself?

01:35:46.907 --> 01:35:47.931
Would that make you feel better?

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:50.705
There's nothing you can do
that would be this embarrassing.

01:35:55.249 --> 01:35:59.652
I fear that I will always be
A lonely number like root three

01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:05.481
A three is all that's good and right

01:36:05.526 --> 01:36:09.895
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:11.625
I wish instead I were a nine

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:15.396
For nine could thwart this evil trick
With just some quick arithmetic

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.127
I know I'll never see the sun

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:20.072
As 1.7321

01:36:20.107 --> 01:36:22.302
You fucking tool.

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:24.573
Quiet, anus.

01:36:27.147 --> 01:36:31.140
Such is my reality
A sad irrationality

01:36:31.185 --> 01:36:33.745
When, hark, just what is this I see?

01:36:34.588 --> 01:36:36.579
Another square root of a three

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.218
Has quietly come waltzing by

01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:40.989
Together now we multiply

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:43.553
To form a number we prefer

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:45.588
Rejoicing as an integer

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.935
We break free from our mortal bonds

01:36:48.969 --> 01:36:50.834
And with a wave of magic wands

01:36:50.871 --> 01:36:53.271
Our square-root signs become unglued

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:55.571
And love for me has been renewed

01:37:04.685 --> 01:37:06.482
You were right.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:09.318
- That was pretty lame.
- Told you.

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:15.458
Look, I can't promise you
the kind of lifestyle that Colton could.

01:37:15.496 --> 01:37:18.294
And I can't promise you
that I'm gonna mature overnight.

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:20.766
But what I can promise you is that...

01:37:27.141 --> 01:37:28.870
Sorry, I smoked weed
with the President.

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.740
I totally forgot
what I was going to say.

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.875
I can promise you
that I will always love you.

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:38.851
And I'll never try and make you
into something that you're not.

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:44.453
So, what do you say
you take a brother back?

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:52.256
Only if you promise to get me
out of this awkward situation...

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:53.323
as soon as possible.

01:37:54.368 --> 01:37:55.460
Come here.

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:00.498
Yeah!

01:38:04.945 --> 01:38:07.038
That's my boy!

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:08.309
Ku!

01:38:14.621 --> 01:38:16.486
Come on.
Let's get the hell back to Jersey.

01:38:16.523 --> 01:38:19.959
All right, hold on. First we gotta
do something for my buddy here.

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.894
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:27.164
# Ooh, baby, do you know
what that's worth? #

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:30.864
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth #

01:38:30.904 --> 01:38:35.068
# They say in heaven love comes first #

01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:38.909
# We'll make heaven a place on earth #

01:38:38.946 --> 01:38:43.076
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth #

01:38:54.061 --> 01:38:55.688
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:38:57.331 --> 01:38:59.231
- No luck, huh?
- No.

01:39:01.101 --> 01:39:03.934
Called every hotel in the city.
I walked all around.

01:39:04.638 --> 01:39:06.037
I just can't find her anywhere.

01:39:06.073 --> 01:39:07.540
- We'll find her.
- We'll find her, dude.

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.374
What?

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.542
Oh, my God, there she is.

01:39:21.221 --> 01:39:23.587
- Roldy, she's hot.
- Dude, go get her!

01:39:29.296 --> 01:39:32.356
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

01:39:32.399 --> 01:39:33.764
- So fuck it. Forget about that.
- Yeah.

01:39:33.801 --> 01:39:35.325
It's probably
just some Amsterdam fling, all right?

01:39:35.369 --> 01:39:36.427
We'll go back to the Jerz...

01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:38.267
- in a couple of days, all right?
- No.

01:39:39.540 --> 01:39:42.008
No, fuck it.

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.339
I came way too far.

01:39:43.377 --> 01:39:44.969
We went through too much shit to...

01:39:45.012 --> 01:39:46.445
I'm gonna talk to her.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.572
No, no, no, dude, don't go in there.

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:48.740
- Come on.
- Just wait.

01:39:48.782 --> 01:39:50.579
Come on, man.
Wait till we get back to Jersey.

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:53.312
What the fuck are you doing?

01:39:53.353 --> 01:39:55.844
<i>- C'est quoi ton putain de prob/ème, toi?
- Harold!</i>

01:39:55.889 --> 01:39:57.754
I didn't understand what you said.

01:39:57.791 --> 01:40:00.487
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

01:40:00.527 --> 01:40:03.155
- You're ruining my shot.
- You what?

01:40:03.197 --> 01:40:05.256
Get off my set!

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.199
I'm so confused. What's...

01:40:07.234 --> 01:40:09.600
- What's going on?
- Harold, I'm doing a photo shoot.

01:40:10.537 --> 01:40:12.129
<i>For High Times magazine.</i>

01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:16.937
Of course, you're a model.
You're very hot. You're a model.

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:19.172
Right. I always wondered
what you did for a living.

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:22.114
I'm sorry. So, wait a second.
So you're not with this dude?

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:23.912
Are you kidding? Me?

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:26.283
- Yeah.
- No.

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:28.686
Anton is like totally gay.

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:36.688
Harold, what are you doing here?

01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:39.560
I didn't want to wait ten days
to see you...

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:42.125
so I thought
I would come and surprise you.

01:40:43.737 --> 01:40:45.864
That is so sweet.

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:47.840
OK. It's sweet.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.810
I've been thinking about you
this whole time.

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.334
- You have?
- I have.

01:40:52.379 --> 01:40:55.871
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you.

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.390
Fuck yeah, dude.

01:41:11.431 --> 01:41:13.729
Bang bang, Roldy.

01:41:15.102 --> 01:41:17.229
Hello, Maria. My name is Kumar.

01:41:17.271 --> 01:41:19.205
- I've heard so much about you.
- Hi.

01:41:19.239 --> 01:41:20.501
This is Vanessa. Vanessa, Maria.

01:41:20.541 --> 01:41:22.236
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

01:41:22.276 --> 01:41:25.973
Ladies and Roldy, how would you
like to get really fucking high...

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.810
since we're in Amsterdam?

01:41:27.848 --> 01:41:29.042
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:32.074
- Sounds like a plan.
- Let's do it.

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:35.282
# So in the beginning
there was hum from a poet #

01:41:35.322 --> 01:41:37.517
# Whose pulse felt drum, drum, drum #

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:38.991
# He would perform praise and all #

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:41.859
# Till one day he heard a voice call
come, come, come #

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:44.193
# Suspicious, he moved,
it was his cost #

01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:46.825
# His missus he thinks
is a little lost #

01:41:46.867 --> 01:41:50.530
# People get held back
by the voice inside 'em #

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:53.563
# Yeah, the voice said
the voices speak inside you #

01:41:53.607 --> 01:41:59.910
# Rejoice and please let me invite you
to evil, greed and lies too #

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.040
# Yeah, confusing days,
he moved aways #

01:42:02.082 --> 01:42:04.607
# He soon became #
# Boom boom boom #

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:07.176
# A knock on his door,
his heart is no more #

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:10.088
# A knock on his door,
his soul is no more #

01:42:12.359 --> 01:42:14.054
# Yeah #

01:42:16.663 --> 01:42:18.426
# That was in the beginning #

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:20.695
# The cops beat him
when all he wants is his freedom #

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:23.066
# So they defeat him,
whatever spirit he's got, beat him #

01:42:23.103 --> 01:42:25.128
# And they teach him the rest of the world
don't need him #

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:27.766
# And he believes the disease
that he's heathen #

01:42:27.808 --> 01:42:29.935
# Put up your fists
if all you want is freedom #

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:32.002
# Put up your fists if all you want is #

01:42:37.618 --> 01:42:39.415
# That was in the beginning #

01:42:42.623 --> 01:42:44.420
# And things change #

01:42:48.562 --> 01:42:50.223
# Yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:42:50.264 --> 01:42:54.257
# We keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:58.635
# And we keep going on,
and on and on and on #

01:42:58.672 --> 01:43:03.200
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:03.243 --> 01:43:07.873
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:07.914 --> 01:43:12.374
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:12.419 --> 01:43:16.981
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:21.393
# And we keep holding on
and we keep being strong #

01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:25.922
# And we keep going on
and on and on and on #

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:30.234
# Brothers and sisters #
# Yeah #

01:43:30.270 --> 01:43:33.433
# We're gonna have church tonight #
# Yeah, yeah! #

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:37.432
# And tonight this speaker
is Reverend Rufus Johnson #

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:41.174
# I wake up praising God every day #

01:43:41.214 --> 01:43:46.151
# I wanna smoke some weed
and roll me a J #

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:48.746
# Thank you, Jesus #
# Thank you, Jesus #

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:52.520
# Thank you, Lord #
# Thank you, Lord #

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:57.360
# For lettin' me live another day, hey, hey #

01:43:57.397 --> 01:43:59.661
# Nigger, I'm high, nigger, you high #
# Uh-huh #

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.464
# Let's get higher than
the motherfucking sky #

01:44:02.502 --> 01:44:04.766
# Watch the butterflies hit the wall #

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:07.467
# And if you're feeling down
give your boy a call #

01:44:07.507 --> 01:44:12.410
# Weed, it takes the stress away, that's
why Bizarre smokes ten blunts a day #

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:15.176
# It's nothing
but the sticky, icky, green stuff #

01:44:15.215 --> 01:44:17.581
# Light it, pass it and take a puff #

01:44:17.617 --> 01:44:20.051
# Having a bad day, stop by my house #

01:44:20.087 --> 01:44:22.612
# 'Cause most likely
I got a blunt in my mouth #

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:24.681
# So sit down, relax and chill #

01:44:24.725 --> 01:44:27.785
# And if you don't smoke weed
