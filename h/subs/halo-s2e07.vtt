WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.936
There is this woman,
she flipped a coin.

00:02.970 --> 00:04.405
She dared me to call it,
and I did.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.274
For luck.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.578
They're responsible, Kai.
For Reach.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.047
-For Vannak.
-The Covenant's responsible.

00:13.081 --> 00:14.615
The Covenant didn't take
our armor.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.484
Centuries of work can be undone

00:16.517 --> 00:19.053
by the smallest of oversights.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.822
[yells]

00:21.855 --> 00:23.457
How did you choose me?

00:23.491 --> 00:26.127
I didn't choose you.
I found you.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.229
When things fall apart,
you're never there.

00:28.262 --> 00:29.797
You ran from
the Spartan program.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.499
You ran from the Rubble.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.834
-Who took Kessler?
-[Laera] The UNSC.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.469
[John]
They're still making Spartans.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.505
-[Laera] What is this place?
-Thermopylae.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.273
[Kai] Infiltrate the ship,

00:39.307 --> 00:41.041
deliver the Spike.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.412
[Kwan gasps]
I know this.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.879
What is it doing here?

00:47.481 --> 00:48.849
What is this place?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.918
[Halsey]
It's where it all began.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.920
[Miranda] Without your research,
I never would have been able

00:52.953 --> 00:54.455
to discover your mistake.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.158
[Cortana] If you were to use
the Artifact

00:57.191 --> 00:59.327
to project yourself back
to the Halo,

00:59.360 --> 01:00.828
you could determine
its location in the stars.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.263
I can't go there without him.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.165
Perhaps I can help.

01:04.198 --> 01:06.200
[John] Cortana.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.136
[Cortana] The Covenant's going
to find the Halo, Chief.

01:08.169 --> 01:11.139
It is imperative
that you get there first.

01:11.172 --> 01:12.606
You need to touch the Artifact.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.942
He said that you let
the whole planet burn.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.311
Sometimes events
are beyond our control.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.180
-You can't trust him.
-[Kai] But I do.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.648
I always have.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.484
[Uto 'Mdama speaking Sangheili]

[yells]

01:32.860 --> 01:38.832
[dramatic music playing]

01:48.642 --> 01:51.110
[Makee] As a child, I came here
in my imagination.

01:52.979 --> 01:54.682
-I always thought it was...
-[John] A dream.

01:54.715 --> 01:55.816
[Makee] ...alive.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.287
I try to understand
what it wants from me.

02:01.555 --> 02:02.990
Why me?

02:04.658 --> 02:05.959
Why you?

02:08.896 --> 02:10.531
[John] Look at me.

02:19.039 --> 02:20.308
I saw you.

02:21.242 --> 02:23.311
On Reach.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.778
With the Sangheili.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.047
The Arbiter is a soldier.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.049
Like you.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.051
You brought the Covenant there.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.120
Millions of people.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.356
Gone.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.258
-Because of you.
-Because of war.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.862
If you could burn High Charity
to embers, would you hesitate?

02:41.895 --> 02:44.565
There's a difference.
You're human.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.667
Am I? Are you?

02:48.936 --> 02:50.871
What if there are no sides?

02:51.905 --> 02:53.541
Only life and death.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.975
Light and dark. Us and them.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.744
We are not the same.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.950
You don't believe that.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.389
I needed to see your eyes.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.793
To know that you understand
what needs to be done.

03:18.098 --> 03:19.633
You found it.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.504
You can't bring
the Covenant here.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.873
Do you understand?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.275
If they control the Halo...

03:27.308 --> 03:29.109
They will annihilate humankind.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.745
And if the humans control it,
they'll annihilate the Covenant.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.381
This is all they know.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.351
The Ring does more than destroy.

03:37.385 --> 03:39.520
It holds the seed
of life itself.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.889
We could build a world here.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.357
A place of peace.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.293
They're not gonna
let that happen.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.627
They don't decide.

03:48.396 --> 03:51.799
The Ring doesn't belong to them.
It belongs to us.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.338
Oh, I see it now.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.640
The difference between us.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.811
You doubt.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.614
[ticking music plays]

04:06.647 --> 04:08.616
[ominous sound]

04:09.517 --> 04:10.584
Move.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.286
You need to move.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.021
[comms crackling]

04:15.022 --> 04:16.324

05:47.448 --> 05:49.182
[breathing heavily]

05:51.952 --> 05:53.521
[Cortana] Did you find it?

05:54.722 --> 05:56.890
[Makee]
The map. Show me.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.261
[uplifting music playing]

06:14.542 --> 06:15.743
[Makee] There.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.115
[dramatic music playing]

07:17.705 --> 07:20.240
[indistinct chatter]

07:20.273 --> 07:21.909
I take it your strike team

07:21.942 --> 07:23.944
has failed to locate
Master Chief.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.146
Allow me to help you.
He's with the Artifact.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.414
[Ackerson] Captain Briggs's
team was moving in

07:27.447 --> 07:29.116
on the target when--

07:29.149 --> 07:31.485
If people learn that Master
Chief in fact is not dead,

07:31.519 --> 07:33.487
it'll lead
to inconvenient questions

07:33.521 --> 07:35.022
about Reach, don't you think?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.057
About who knew what, and when.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.927
Well, we won't have
to worry about that.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.629
Did you say "we"?

07:41.662 --> 07:44.131
You were in charge.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.866
Acting on your orders.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.771
But I'm not even in the ONI.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.706
What's taking so long?
Where's the feed?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.775
[Smith]
Coming back online now, ma'am.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.343
Signal reacquired, ma'am.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.811
We're tracking
the Covenant Cruiser.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.748
It just exited slipspace
in the Soell system.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.052
That's a Covenant battle group.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.723
That's the entire First Fleet
of Solemn Accord.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.894
-What's wrong with it?
-It's the signal, ma'am.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.295
There's significant energy

08:15.328 --> 08:17.197
coming from the center
of that system.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.767
Solar flare. Nova activity.
Black hole.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.470
Contact Admiral Stanforth

08:23.503 --> 08:26.006
to dispatch the UNSC fleet
from Sector 3.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.775
Ready the Spartan-IIIs.

08:29.943 --> 08:33.179
My Spartan-IIIs were trained
to execute specialized missions.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.982
I thought you said
they were ready?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.984
They're elite soldiers.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.419
They're not designed to assault
a Covenant fleet without--

08:39.452 --> 08:42.255
It's your job to prepare them.
I decide how they're used.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.393
Now, if there's nothing else,
I suggest you find him.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.737
It's not a black hole.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.040
[door chimes]

09:02.943 --> 09:05.779
[heavy footsteps]

09:05.813 --> 09:07.781
[door chimes and slides open]

09:09.449 --> 09:12.753
[heavy footsteps]

09:12.786 --> 09:17.424
[quietly suspenseful
music plays]

09:17.457 --> 09:18.759
[door slides open]

09:18.792 --> 09:21.094
[Briggs]
John-117, stop where you are.

09:23.631 --> 09:25.098
On your knees.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.700
We have orders to take you in.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.301
Those aren't your orders.

09:28.335 --> 09:30.170
He's resisting.
Take him down.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.173
I said take him down.

09:34.742 --> 09:36.009
Shoot him.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.114
I've been on that side
of the gun.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.951
I didn't ask questions.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.385
I didn't want to know.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.787
[Briggs] Pull the trigger!

09:46.820 --> 09:49.389
But we always know, don't we?

09:49.422 --> 09:50.891
I gave you an order, Lieutenant.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.392
She knows you can't take
a bullet back.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.628
That's why she wants it
to be yours.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.163
But if you're gonna kill me...

09:57.665 --> 09:59.667
at least look me in the eyes.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.309
What are you doing?
I said engage!

10:10.811 --> 10:11.879
Do it yourself.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.685
Stop right there!

10:20.988 --> 10:22.389
Didn't ask for your help.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.959
[Kai]
Were you gonna do it?

10:25.993 --> 10:29.296
[doors clack and whirr]

10:30.563 --> 10:32.933
[Miranda] This structure might
not be stable, we should go.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.601
[Halsey]
We're not going anywhere.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.771
Whoever designed this complex
built the Halo.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.372
What is this place?

10:39.406 --> 10:41.775
It's a repository for knowledge,
like a library.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.343
Or a religious site.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.946
[Halsey] As the original
lead scientist on this project,

10:45.979 --> 10:48.181
I can assure you
it is a library.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.983
As you can see
from the node walls...

10:50.017 --> 10:51.785
[Miranda] Like you'd find
in a church or a chapel.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.120
Got it.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.421
You have no idea.

10:55.422 --> 10:56.824
Thanks.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.728
You said something
about a mistake.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.295
[Miranda] Did I?

11:02.329 --> 11:04.231
[Halsey]
Yes, you said I made a mistake.

11:04.264 --> 11:06.900
[Miranda] When you solved the
first cipher back in the day,

11:06.934 --> 11:10.370
you did so according
to your own familiar principles.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.005
Data, mathematics.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.007
And you unlocked
the first alcove.

11:14.708 --> 11:17.544
-Simple.
-It wasn't that simple.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.547
-It took me weeks to solve it.
-It took you four months.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.015
I have your notes, remember?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.051
[loud rumbling]

11:24.084 --> 11:25.652
You opened this one.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.255
But what you overlooked
is that the cipher

11:28.288 --> 11:30.223
isn't just mathematical.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.193
It's also linguistic.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.997
In this case,
a complex ideographic system

11:37.030 --> 11:39.532
with a number of logographic
traits, some phonemes...

11:39.566 --> 11:41.568
Do you think this will take
a long time?

11:42.402 --> 11:44.104
It'll take less
than four months.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.040
[thud, loud rumble]

11:51.311 --> 11:52.579
[mysterious hiss]

11:52.612 --> 11:54.247
[Halsey exhales]

11:54.281 --> 11:55.715
What was inside?

11:55.749 --> 11:57.250
You first.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.288
Whatever you found
wasn't in your notes.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.456
Tell me.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.558
DNA.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.461
Theirs.

12:08.495 --> 12:10.163
And ours.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.732
[gasps softly]

12:12.766 --> 12:17.771
[dramatic music playing]

12:20.941 --> 12:22.475
[overlapping chatter]

12:22.509 --> 12:23.911
[Jones] I have the commander
of the lead Condor.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.712
-Name's Bookman.
-Put him through.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.315
[surrounding chatter continues]

12:28.348 --> 12:31.484
Commander Bookman,
this is Admiral Parangosky.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.820
Can your team hear me?

12:32.853 --> 12:34.087
[Bookman, over P.A.]
Yes, ma'am.

12:34.121 --> 12:35.655
Our enemy's about to learn

12:35.688 --> 12:38.158
that there's a cost
to tangling with humanity.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.293
I'm asking you
to deliver the bill.

12:41.294 --> 12:43.063
-Can you do that for me?
-Yes, ma'am.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.232
Arrow Team, make ready.
On my mark.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.766
Godspeed.

12:46.800 --> 12:47.868
Spartans on the beam.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.970
[combat sounds]

12:50.203 --> 12:51.972
-[loud crash]
-[static crackles, alarm beeps]

12:52.005 --> 12:54.507
[Jones] Condor-Hotel-Tango-3,
come in.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.443
[background chatter]

12:56.476 --> 12:59.947
Condor-Charlie-November-2
radio check.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.983
All assassin Condors,
this TAC-CON ONYX, over.

13:04.284 --> 13:07.020
Any Assassin Condors, respond.

13:07.054 --> 13:08.188
Deploy the second wave.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.990
-[officer] Yes, Admiral.
-What?

13:10.023 --> 13:11.491
No, the first wave
just got obliterated

13:11.524 --> 13:12.692
and now you're sending more?

13:12.725 --> 13:14.094
What do you expect will happen?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.963
I expect they'll follow
their orders.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.499
Admiral...

13:19.532 --> 13:21.001
don't do this.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.104
Tell me the moment
our Condors exit slipspace.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.772
[Ackerson]
This is unsound.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.475
How many Spartan-IIIs
are you willing to sacrifice?

13:28.508 --> 13:29.642
All of them.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.512
This isn't just another battle.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.982
What do you think
is at the center of that system?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.250
If the Covenant
takes the Halo...

13:38.418 --> 13:40.520
we won't live
to fight another day.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.822
There will be no more days.

13:42.856 --> 13:48.828
[ominous music plays]

13:49.596 --> 13:51.798
[Ackerson draws sharp breath]

13:53.833 --> 13:57.570
[footsteps]

13:57.604 --> 13:59.172
[dull clank]

13:59.206 --> 14:00.673
[Laera] Where are we going?

14:03.010 --> 14:05.946
They brought us to a place
just like this.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.214
We were kids.

14:08.081 --> 14:12.152
Our trainers told us
that the objective

14:12.185 --> 14:14.121
was to defend the pass.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.556
But that wasn't it.

14:18.325 --> 14:20.260
What was the objective?

14:20.293 --> 14:24.131
To learn... what it meant
to call yourself a Spartan.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.533
I fought with everything I had.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.503
But they were soldiers.
They were too big, too fast.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.172
They had batons.

14:32.973 --> 14:37.310
You had two options--
stand and bleed, or run.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.545
Most ran.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.881
Until you're in
that situation...

14:41.915 --> 14:43.616
[weapon clacking]

14:43.650 --> 14:46.686
...you don't know what kind
of person you are.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.488
I wasn't brave.

14:49.356 --> 14:52.492
I just kept moving forward

14:52.525 --> 14:55.963
when others went back.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.698
By the third night,
there were only five of us left:

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434
Me. Riz.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.804
Vannak. Kai.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.073
John.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.242
[wind howls]

15:09.276 --> 15:13.213
So we stood together.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.849
[muffled blows]

15:18.018 --> 15:20.020
And we fought together.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.688
[muffled blows]

15:23.923 --> 15:25.192
And we lost...

15:27.860 --> 15:29.096
together.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.939
What are we gonna do
about Kessler?

15:44.611 --> 15:46.113
Nothing.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.380
What?

15:47.414 --> 15:50.550
Tonight is his.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.618
What are you saying?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.620
If we take this away from him,

15:53.653 --> 15:55.422
he'll never know
which person he is.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.125
What the hell
did they do to you?

15:58.158 --> 15:59.592
If you mean by "they,"

15:59.626 --> 16:02.095
the people who stood by me
no matter what?

16:02.129 --> 16:04.097
I stand by you no matter what!

16:09.636 --> 16:12.272
All that time you were
obsessing about Halsey,

16:13.406 --> 16:15.475
you weren't trying
to bring her to justice.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.511
You were trying
to find your way back.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.050
It meant something,
being a Spartan.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.785
You are not a Spartan.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.157
You have a life.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.126
You have a marriage.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.428
You have a son.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.966
And I'll be damned
if anyone's going to hurt him.

16:41.034 --> 16:42.635
He doesn't belong here.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.004
I won't let them
turn him into a killer.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.639
And I won't let you.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.341
-Laera...
-[Laera] Don't!

16:48.375 --> 16:50.977
[footsteps recede]

16:51.010 --> 16:54.381
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

16:56.816 --> 17:01.020
[weapons clatter]

17:01.054 --> 17:02.489
Slow down.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.191
I can't feel my fingers.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.193
Take a breath.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.294
You're all right.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.762
I'm gonna mess this up.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.631
[nearby equipment whirrs]

17:11.664 --> 17:13.266
I screwed up
the last simulation.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.634
Take it easy.

17:14.666 --> 17:16.868
You're okay.

17:16.903 --> 17:18.871
[sniffles]

17:18.905 --> 17:20.540
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die.

17:22.842 --> 17:25.512
You're just scared
of being scared.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.881
When that plasma starts flying,

17:28.915 --> 17:31.218
you won't have time
to be scared for yourself.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.655
Because you'll be scared for me,
and I'll be scared for you.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.359
I'll be watching
your ass every minute.

17:40.026 --> 17:42.095
So you better be watching mine.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.566
Copy?

17:49.702 --> 17:50.837
Yeah.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.673
[dramatic music playing]

17:53.706 --> 17:56.876
[weapons clacking]

17:56.909 --> 17:58.711
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

17:58.745 --> 17:59.812
[Kai] John.

17:59.846 --> 18:03.483
[marching footsteps]

18:03.516 --> 18:05.685
Look, this isn't all on me.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.320
You lied to us.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.722
You put us in harm's way.
You got us grounded.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.027
I tried to help you,
but you wouldn't listen.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.430
What was I supposed to do?
I had to make a call.

18:17.464 --> 18:19.432
You made the wrong call.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.370
You trusted people
who wanted us dead.

18:27.407 --> 18:30.210
I made a mistake.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.778
Maybe you don't know
what that feels like,

18:31.811 --> 18:33.112
but that's what humans do.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.414
They make mistakes.

18:36.048 --> 18:37.750
But we shouldn't be here.

18:40.052 --> 18:41.754
Where are we going?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.856
-John?
-I need my suit.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.592
-You don't know where it is?
-No.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.026
But she does.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.396
[footsteps]

18:49.429 --> 18:51.698
[Halsey] Even then, I understood
what it meant.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.701
The DNA I found in that vault
was both human and not.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.204
-A mutation?
-[Halsey] A possibility.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.138
An invitation to unlock

18:59.172 --> 19:01.308
the full potential
of our species.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.243
So, I started looking.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.044
I assembled a team.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.381
We scoured the galaxy for those
people who exhibited traces

19:08.415 --> 19:10.149
of the genetic sequence
that I found here.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.651
You took children.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.322
I needed Spartans.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.789
We all did.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.425
Who else knows about this?

19:22.529 --> 19:24.096
[Halsey]
Show me what you found.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.365
[soft exhalation]

19:27.534 --> 19:29.135
[rummaging sound]

19:32.439 --> 19:34.474
[Miranda] Whatever it is,
it must be valuable.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.812
[sighs]

19:44.617 --> 19:47.053
[dramatic music playing]

20:05.538 --> 20:09.242

the same simulation parameters.

20:40.206 --> 20:41.541
Thank you, Cortana.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.242
Wait. John. No.

20:43.276 --> 20:44.344
John...

[grunts]

20:46.546 --> 20:47.980
[groaning]

20:48.014 --> 20:49.416
[John]
Give me one reason

20:49.449 --> 20:51.418
why I shouldn't kill this guy
right now.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.553
Honestly nothing comes to mind.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.221
[grunting]
John.

20:57.524 --> 21:01.394
Where is my armor?

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
[strained speech]
I know where it is!

21:03.530 --> 21:05.532
I can get it for you.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.899
Tell me.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.868
It's behind a biometric lock!

21:08.901 --> 21:10.503
We need his face.

21:10.537 --> 21:12.639
Hmm? Attached?

21:14.040 --> 21:16.208
[groaning]

21:16.242 --> 21:17.710
[grunts]

21:18.711 --> 21:21.414
[Ackerson] Parangosky lied
about the Spike.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.517
It doesn't do what we told them.

21:24.551 --> 21:25.952
[John] Let's go.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.254
It's not an override.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.391
The virus compresses
the ship's fusion drive,

21:31.424 --> 21:33.460
creating a reaction
powerful enough

21:33.493 --> 21:35.595
to incinerate everything
within a million miles.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.698
-Wait, what?
-Their fleet. Our fleet.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.933
Perhaps even the Halo itself.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.403
Parangosky's throwing
Spartan-IIIs

21:43.436 --> 21:44.937
at the Covenant fleet in swarms

21:44.971 --> 21:47.039
because she doesn't need
all of them to make it.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.809
She just needs one.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.813
One team. One Spike.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.948
One ship.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.151
The Spartans are Parangosky's
insurance policy.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.220
Her fail-safe.

22:01.253 --> 22:03.623
If we lose this battle
against the Covenant,

22:03.656 --> 22:05.157
we won't get the Halo.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.327
But with Parangosky's Spike,
neither will they.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.932
Since when do you care
about Spartans?

22:15.034 --> 22:17.637
These Spartans
are my life's work.

22:21.941 --> 22:23.175
I've heard that before.

22:23.209 --> 22:28.114
[dramatic music plays]

22:31.350 --> 22:32.985
[Miranda]
What happened?

22:34.220 --> 22:35.455
To my father?

22:41.794 --> 22:43.530
They say he stayed behind.

22:43.563 --> 22:44.897
On Reach.

22:47.133 --> 22:48.701
You know your father.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.671
He would never leave.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.443
Survivors are scattered
all over the galaxy.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.377
Can't be sure
he's not one of them.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.381
I saw it.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.385
Miranda, I-- I saw him.

23:07.987 --> 23:09.321
At the end.

23:12.191 --> 23:13.392
[sighs]

23:13.426 --> 23:14.594
Oh.

Now that's something.

Not just math.
Not just language.

These are stars.

25:00.867 --> 25:02.301
I couldn't save him.

25:07.707 --> 25:11.778
Vannak looked at me
and he didn't understand...

25:12.945 --> 25:15.414
how he got there.

25:15.447 --> 25:17.216
He wasn't scared.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.587
He just didn't understand.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.891
[Ackerson]
What are we going to do?

25:28.160 --> 25:31.497
Well, I came here
to punch a hole in your chest.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.801
Watch the life drain out of you,
like my friend.

25:39.672 --> 25:41.608
I didn't give the orders
on Reach.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.275
[Kai]
But you followed them.

25:44.310 --> 25:46.112
And I followed you.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.788
You are going to tell everybody

25:55.822 --> 25:59.792
what Parangosky did on Reach.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.429
And then you're gonna
tell the truth

26:03.462 --> 26:04.997
about what you did too.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.735
It'll be my word against hers.
I don't have proof.

26:08.768 --> 26:10.269
I'm the proof.

26:10.302 --> 26:13.072
The moment I walk out of here
in that suit,

26:13.105 --> 26:16.508
everything that Parangosky did,
everything she said,

26:16.542 --> 26:18.144
it all becomes a lie.

26:20.947 --> 26:23.482
I'll be destroyed too.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.285
It all costs something.

26:26.318 --> 26:28.320
Even when you can't see it.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.390
That's what you people
never understand.

26:32.458 --> 26:34.326
Somebody always pays.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.029
This time, it's you.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.166
[shaky breathing]

26:45.171 --> 26:46.472
[sighs]

27:01.320 --> 27:04.056
[faint ringing sound]

27:04.090 --> 27:06.826
[Halsey] That constellation
is Veles's Net.

27:07.894 --> 27:09.061
Yeah.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.665
And that's Loviatar's Wing.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.838
And the Grand Cross
is the final piece.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.714
Nothing's happening.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.817
We must have missed something.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.885
The cipher's a test.

27:33.720 --> 27:37.489
Do we share their understanding
of mathematics?

27:37.523 --> 27:38.758
Biology?

27:40.426 --> 27:42.128
Do we communicate
the way they did?

27:43.295 --> 27:46.632
Do we explore
the way they explored?

27:48.968 --> 27:50.703
Are we curious?

27:52.471 --> 27:53.940
It's not a map.

27:56.608 --> 27:57.810
It's a clock.

28:01.147 --> 28:02.882
What?

28:02.915 --> 28:06.052
[Kwan] It projects the stars as
they are, as we see them, but...

28:07.086 --> 28:09.055
this isn't their sky.

28:18.564 --> 28:20.132
[Halsey]
What are you doing?

28:21.834 --> 28:22.935
Stars...

28:26.238 --> 28:27.940
they move over time.

28:27.974 --> 28:31.243
Millions of years.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.587
How do you know where they go?

28:41.620 --> 28:44.056
I've seen it before.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.524
[Miranda]
Seen what?

28:47.459 --> 28:49.361
[Kwan] Their stars.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.235
It was like a dream.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.171
[mystical music playing]

29:35.207 --> 29:37.609
-Wait.
-[Halsey] You must be joking!

29:37.643 --> 29:39.078
[loud thud]

29:58.397 --> 29:59.765
[gasps softly]

30:01.834 --> 30:03.836
Wait, what if...

30:09.876 --> 30:12.178
[quiet music playing]

30:12.211 --> 30:13.880
Are you coming or not?

30:16.748 --> 30:18.985
[Kai]
You know what we have to do.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.588
-It's not that simple.
-You heard what Ackerson said.

30:22.621 --> 30:25.057
Parangosky's throwing
the Spartan-IIIs into the fire.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.559
-We gotta go with them.
-I can't come with you.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.528
Why not?

30:29.561 --> 30:31.430
Because Parangosky's right, Kai.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.764
What are you talking about?

30:32.798 --> 30:34.500
I'm not saying
it doesn't matter.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.868
I'm not saying it doesn't hurt.

30:35.902 --> 30:37.369
But if we lose the Halo...

30:37.403 --> 30:38.905
You heard what he said.

30:38.938 --> 30:40.706
We're talking
about an entire fleet.

30:40.739 --> 30:44.443
I'm talking about
the end of everything.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.178
The Halo has more
than one purpose,

30:46.212 --> 30:48.915
but in the wrong hands,
it is a weapon.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.817
I'm going with them.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.287
They're mine.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.089
I can't let them go alone.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.825
I need to be there.

31:00.659 --> 31:02.061
I know.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.500
If it comes down to it...

31:11.437 --> 31:13.305
and it's you

31:13.339 --> 31:15.241
with that Spike in your hand...

31:18.477 --> 31:20.412
Just get to the Halo.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.648
No matter what.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.153
[door slides open]

31:28.687 --> 31:29.755
[door slides closed]

31:30.422 --> 31:32.291
[dramatic music playing]

31:33.859 --> 31:35.261
[Kwan] Those symbols.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.029
What does it say?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.399
I haven't seen that one before.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.568
The central segment looks
like the ideograph

31:42.601 --> 31:45.171
for "growth" or "rebirth,"
but the symbol at the top

31:45.204 --> 31:47.439
usually has negative
connotations.

31:47.473 --> 31:48.807
Given the positioning,

31:48.840 --> 31:50.609
maybe it modifies
the other symbol.

31:50.642 --> 31:56.648
It could mean anything.
Change. Division. Decay.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.822
-[lock tumbles]
-[laughs]

32:03.855 --> 32:06.392
[loud clanking]

32:08.660 --> 32:11.964
[ringing sound]

32:18.404 --> 32:20.372
[faint ringing sound]

32:20.406 --> 32:21.540
[Halsey sighs]

32:25.144 --> 32:26.745
[Kwan]
It's a tomb.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.148
It's not a tomb.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.750
It's a laboratory.

32:46.398 --> 32:47.833
And that...

32:56.175 --> 32:57.909
It's a scientist.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.548
[Miranda] It's almost human.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.854
Don't touch it.

33:08.887 --> 33:10.356
There's something in its hand.

33:13.892 --> 33:15.161
[Kwan] Wait.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.662
[crackling]

33:16.695 --> 33:18.164
[panting]

33:18.197 --> 33:23.202
[glass crackling]

33:23.235 --> 33:25.537
-[rumbling]
-[Kwan] We need to move.

33:25.571 --> 33:27.339
Halsey, let's go.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.740
[gasps]

33:28.774 --> 33:30.509
-Get out!
-[Halsey] No, Miranda...

33:30.542 --> 33:34.180
[ominous music rises]

33:34.213 --> 33:35.547
Move!

33:36.582 --> 33:39.051
[ominous music playing]

33:44.623 --> 33:46.825
-[Halsey] Look.
-Halsey!

33:48.794 --> 33:50.296
Look at this...

33:50.329 --> 33:52.264
-Halsey!
-Can you see?

33:52.298 --> 33:54.966
[Miranda]
We have to go! Halsey!

33:55.000 --> 33:57.002
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

33:57.903 --> 33:59.605
Mom!

33:59.638 --> 34:00.906
Please.

34:02.408 --> 34:04.476
[suspenseful music playing]

34:08.179 --> 34:09.281
[grunts]

34:14.686 --> 34:16.788
We have to get back there.
That was a city.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.056
A city.

34:18.090 --> 34:19.757
Imagine the technology,

34:19.791 --> 34:21.659
the ingenuity required
to build that--

34:21.693 --> 34:23.929
-What's happening?
-[Halsey] It's beautiful.

34:24.830 --> 34:25.897
It's spreading.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.466
It's their history.

34:28.100 --> 34:30.902
The story of their empire
expanding.

34:30.936 --> 34:33.105
All these worlds they knew.

34:35.974 --> 34:37.275
Growth.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.110
-What's wrong?
-It's real.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.646
-What is?
-We can't be here.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.813
-[Miranda] Kwan--
-[Halsey] No. Let her go.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.851
Miranda, tell me.

34:46.985 --> 34:48.320
Tell me you got it.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.667
[chuckles]

35:01.700 --> 35:03.369
[distant rumble]

35:05.471 --> 35:06.838
[snarling softly]

35:12.511 --> 35:14.180
[speaks Sangheili]

35:18.850 --> 35:20.719
[speaks Sangheili]

35:28.594 --> 35:30.162
[thudding, loud crash]

35:58.690 --> 36:01.059
[dramatic music playing]

36:21.413 --> 36:23.815
[breathing heavily]

36:24.583 --> 36:26.117
[sizzling]

36:26.151 --> 36:28.287
[screams]

36:29.955 --> 36:31.790
[gasps and pants]

37:08.427 --> 37:10.629
[rhythmic thudding]

37:12.498 --> 37:13.599
[Laera] Kessler!

37:14.466 --> 37:16.101
Kessler!

37:16.134 --> 37:18.304
[footsteps thudding rapidly]

37:21.106 --> 37:22.308
[grunts]

37:37.556 --> 37:39.190
[yells]

37:41.493 --> 37:44.296
[grunts and screams]

37:49.501 --> 37:50.469
Hey.

37:50.502 --> 37:51.837
[metal bar clanking]

37:53.905 --> 37:55.407
[sighs] Kessler.

37:56.207 --> 37:57.676
It's me.

38:00.546 --> 38:01.580
Hey.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.486
[Laera] Soren!

38:07.519 --> 38:09.321
Mom!

38:09.355 --> 38:10.956
[Laera screaming]

38:10.989 --> 38:12.524
[grunting]

38:19.898 --> 38:21.266
[Soren] Kessler!

38:31.743 --> 38:33.812
[indistinct chatter over P.A.]

38:43.689 --> 38:44.990
[John] Nice suit.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.205
How are you alive?

39:00.772 --> 39:02.941
I could ask the same thing
about you.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.819
You're coming with us.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.558
I have a different mission.

39:22.394 --> 39:25.296
You know what it would mean
to them to see you're alive.

39:25.330 --> 39:27.633
To know you're fighting
beside them.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.869
You know what
it would mean to me.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.941
When the battle ends,

39:35.974 --> 39:38.444
they don't talk about the ones
who don't come home.

39:38.477 --> 39:41.580
They just call it a victory

39:42.881 --> 39:47.152
and say it was because of me.

39:47.185 --> 39:51.690
Because of something I did,
or something I had, or--

39:51.723 --> 39:53.058
Or something you are.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.927
Something you can't see.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.731
But you feel it.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.332
I know you feel it.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.704
Moving through you.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.008
That woman made you
flip that coin

40:10.041 --> 40:12.277
all those times
when you were a kid.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.348
Was it luck?

40:17.382 --> 40:18.917
Did you guess?

40:20.686 --> 40:21.920
I told you, I...

40:23.021 --> 40:24.055
I just knew.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.858
Did you know?

40:26.892 --> 40:28.960
Or did you make it
come up heads?

40:42.874 --> 40:44.209
Perez.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.083
I'll be all right.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.120
One way or the other.

41:05.797 --> 41:08.133
[Miranda]
What do you suppose it does?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.002
Well, she was a scientist
and she died clutching it, so...

41:11.837 --> 41:13.138
It's her work.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.146
I spent the last five months
down in that site.

41:21.179 --> 41:23.749
Staying late, working alone,

41:23.782 --> 41:25.150
just me and your notes.

41:26.351 --> 41:29.688
In a way, it felt like I was
talking to who you used to be.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.424
I want to meet the people
who built that city

41:33.458 --> 41:35.594
just as much as you do.

41:37.863 --> 41:39.665
And don't worry.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.968
If you never get there, I will.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.340
I believe you.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.982
[P.A.] Security team
to Section 70.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.484
Possible unauthorized
personnel.

42:03.488 --> 42:06.024
[dramatic music playing]

42:14.666 --> 42:17.435
[gasps]

42:17.468 --> 42:19.204
Halsey?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.141
[Miranda] Mom?

42:24.142 --> 42:26.377
[breathing heavily]

42:27.713 --> 42:29.347
[Miranda laughs]

42:30.849 --> 42:32.818
[sighs] Now that's something.

42:37.422 --> 42:39.524
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

42:42.728 --> 42:48.734
[dramatic music playing]

42:55.440 --> 42:57.575
[man] Let's go, Master Chief.

42:57.609 --> 43:01.479
[dramatic music rises,
then falls]

43:01.512 --> 43:03.749
You know, I've been doing this
a long time.

43:03.782 --> 43:05.450
I beg your pardon?

43:06.551 --> 43:07.585
Oh?

43:07.619 --> 43:09.087
Are we going to pretend

43:09.120 --> 43:11.556
you didn't do an analysis
of the Spike code?

43:11.589 --> 43:14.025
And unauthorized simulations?

43:14.926 --> 43:16.662
You know,
I've always found it helps

43:16.695 --> 43:18.429
to know what my people
are thinking.

43:18.463 --> 43:21.767
Especially when I'm not there.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.368
What about the Spartan-IIIs?

43:23.401 --> 43:25.336
-What about them?
-They trusted me.

43:25.370 --> 43:27.072
I told them they could win.

43:27.105 --> 43:30.108
You can't do this to them.

43:30.141 --> 43:32.010
You mean I can't do this to you.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.078
No.

43:33.879 --> 43:35.513
To them.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.582
[Jones] Flight Deck,
this is Launch Control.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.351
We're detecting a heat plume
on Condor UBX-19.

43:40.385 --> 43:43.588
Condor UBX-19, this is Control.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.523
You do not have an approved
flight plan.

43:45.556 --> 43:47.125
You're not cleared for launch.

43:48.293 --> 43:49.427
[radio static crackles]

43:49.460 --> 43:51.429
UBX-19, identify yourself.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.599
[John, over comms]
This is Master Chief John-117.

43:55.801 --> 43:57.235
You were saying?

43:57.268 --> 43:59.270
-Restrain this man.
-[man] Yes, Admiral.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.539
See, when the story of what
happened on Reach gets told,

44:01.572 --> 44:03.809
when the story of what happened
here gets told,

44:03.842 --> 44:05.877
I think they'll listen to him,
don't you?

44:05.911 --> 44:08.313
[dramatic music playing]

44:11.149 --> 44:13.518

44:16.955 --> 44:19.590
[indistinct radio chatter]

44:34.505 --> 44:36.341
[Kai]
Get it out of your head.

44:38.810 --> 44:40.511
He's not coming.

44:42.981 --> 44:44.482
[alarm sounds]

44:46.317 --> 44:49.888
[indistinct radio chatter]

45:08.073 --> 45:10.842
