This brought back a memory.

There was a storm.

01:03:01.402 --> 01:03:05.739
And thousands and thousands of
starfish were washed up on the shore.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:07.741
Only four days ago
you waved him over.

01:03:07.909 --> 01:03:09.326
Let's just hold on, hold on.

01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:11.286
And there was this beautiful little girl
running down the beach

01:03:11.454 --> 01:03:12.537
picking up the starfish.

01:03:12.705 --> 01:03:14.206
She was frantically throwing them
back into the ocean.

01:03:14.373 --> 01:03:16.958
When I saw her doing this, I said to her,
"why are you doing that?

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.837
You can only save a few before they die.
What difference does it make?"

01:03:21.005 --> 01:03:27.093
And she looked at me and she said,
"to that one, it makes a difference."

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:31.848
"To that one, it makes a difference,"
that little girl said.

01:03:32.016 --> 01:03:33.141
And she was right.

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.185
At that very moment, she was making
a difference for that starfish,

01:03:35.353 --> 01:03:37.646
and she was making a difference for herself,
too, because she was

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:40.398
connected to that starfish.

01:03:40.566 --> 01:03:42.692
And that's what life is all about--
connecting.

you're ever alive, really,

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.823

that's reassuring to him

01:21:45.775 --> 01:21:47.151
Okay, Sam, what's up?

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:49.069
Barry, he's on the floor
with one of his mats.

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:50.571
The grass mats.

01:21:50.739 --> 01:21:52.239
Get ready to go to a shot of him
or a close one on the mat.

01:21:52.407 --> 01:21:54.199
Right. One, on Barry.
Two, tight on mat.

01:21:54.367 --> 01:21:57.077
Here we go.
Ricky, I am not on-air talent!

01:21:57.245 --> 01:21:59.663
Also, get ready to go
to the graphics. Ready!

01:21:59.831 --> 01:22:05.502
- Okay, graphics prepped and ready.
- You have to let go of your worries.

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.088
- Go to graphics.
- Go to graphics.

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:10.049
- Go to g.
- G.

01:22:10.216 --> 01:22:12.718
- G up.
- Give in.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.262
To your desires.

01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:17.598
- Go to graphics.
- Graphics.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.600
Go to g.
On g.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:23.312
- And take the journey.
- To your telephone

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.105
and call the good buy channel

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:27.107
where the good buys are available
24-hours a day.

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.109
- Go to graphics.
- Graphics.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:31.195
- Go to Barry.
- And to Barry.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.948
Cue Barry.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:38.369
[Stammering]
Okay.

01:22:38.912 --> 01:22:40.496
Thanks, g.

01:22:40.664 --> 01:22:42.414
[Chuckles] Um--

01:22:42.582 --> 01:22:43.874
[ricky]
Good.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:45.876
You're watching the, uh,
the good buy shopping network,

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:51.048
where the grass is always
just a little bit greener.

01:22:52.008 --> 01:22:54.093
[Phone ringing]
Look at him go.

01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:57.805
This is Kate.
Hi, Mary.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.182
Great. I'll tell him.

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.644
Well, we don't have to worry about
what to do with the grass mats.

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:07.564
- They're selling out.
- Already?

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.151
Now, that's what I like to hear.
The grass mats are selling out.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.655
All right!

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:18.033
[Laughing]
Thank you so much.
Good job.

01:23:18.201 --> 01:23:22.663
[Barry]
If you're feeling bad, and you
want a little spring in your winter--

01:23:27.043 --> 01:23:32.381
[crowd shouting]

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:28.103
Well, that was just the best macaroni
and cheese dinner I think I ever had.

01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:30.064
Kraft in the box is, of course,
the classic,

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:33.150
- but you have a touch.
- My pleasure.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:38.947
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

01:24:39.574 --> 01:24:40.949
Wait a minute.

01:24:41.117 --> 01:24:43.535
The way you say "I'm fine--"

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:46.246
what's the matter?

01:24:47.123 --> 01:24:51.085
I'm worried about g.
Remember when we first met him?

01:24:51.252 --> 01:24:54.254
He was so happy.
And that smile.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:57.257
And now he just seems drained.

01:24:57.425 --> 01:24:59.593
Well, like us.
You know, it's all the work.

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.762
Right, it is all the work.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:04.723
And now that he's caught on,
it'll only get worse.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:09.061
It started so simply, and now it's
become this whole, big production.

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:12.397
It's the Hayman and Newell circus
with the g chants

01:25:12.565 --> 01:25:14.775
and the orchestras
and the announcers.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:16.110
Kinda fun, huh?

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.778
Kitsch. Oh. Yeah?

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.948
Today, at the station, they were
pitching me things that go

01:25:21.116 --> 01:25:23.117
way beyond the g t-shirts.

01:25:23.284 --> 01:25:24.701
What did they show you?

01:25:24.869 --> 01:25:29.331
They have got this cheese spread named
after him, called g whiz.

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:31.792
[Chuckling]
What? Is that terrible?
Oh.

01:25:31.960 --> 01:25:33.752
- You knew about this?
- I helped come up with it.

01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.295
- I thought it was funny.
- Oh, Ricky.

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:36.755
What?

01:25:36.923 --> 01:25:38.590
What about that wrapping
ribbon called the--

01:25:38.758 --> 01:25:40.342
the g string.

01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.344
[Snickering]

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.429
Look, I mean, who are
we hurting anyway?

01:25:44.597 --> 01:25:48.142
You know, the people who are
getting this amazing message?

01:25:48.309 --> 01:25:49.643
I don't think so.
You know.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:51.311
Certainly-- are we hurting g?

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:54.314
You know, instead of getting stuff
tossed at him on some lonely highway,

01:25:54.482 --> 01:25:57.568
he's reaching America,
he's reaching the country.

01:25:57.735 --> 01:25:59.444
Who's losing out?
It's all good.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:01.822
Yes, but we are making money
off of that image.

01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:04.616
But--no--but so does every religion
that sells a crucifix

01:26:04.784 --> 01:26:07.578
or a star of David or a stick
of incense is making money.

01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:09.538
And, you know, everything
that we sell,

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:13.083
people are buying, I think,
'cause they feel closer to g.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:16.503
And if they wear a g t-shirt,
people think, oh, you know,

01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:19.047
what he's all about, what he's talking
about, and they become better people.

01:26:19.215 --> 01:26:21.466
Don't you think so?
I think so.

01:26:21.634 --> 01:26:24.178
- The difference is?
- What?

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:27.306
G would do this for free.

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:33.645
I think we should let him go.

01:26:34.272 --> 01:26:35.564
What?

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:36.940
[Stammering]

01:26:37.108 --> 01:26:38.525
I mean, he's not chained
in my basement, you know.

01:26:38.693 --> 01:26:39.818
He's a free man.

01:26:39.986 --> 01:26:43.989
- But what are you talking about?
- It's the right thing to do.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.536
I've decided to take g prime time.

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:52.164
I'm gonna give him
his own half-hour show.

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:53.373
What's the matter?

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.167
Surely you don't think
this is a bad idea.

01:26:55.335 --> 01:26:56.585
No, no.

01:26:56.753 --> 01:26:58.545
He has the broadest appeal of any
on-air personality we've ever had.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.422
Yeah, that's right,
that's right, but, uh--

01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:03.592
and I love the idea of a new g show.
I was thinking the same thing.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.968
This is so funny.

01:27:05.136 --> 01:27:06.428
That's why I wanted to talk to you.
Listen to this.

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:10.265
I think it's a great idea. What if, uh,
we start a show--whatever time slot--

01:27:10.433 --> 01:27:14.603
with g and other hosts?

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:15.979
Wait a minute.

01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:19.316
An ensemble show, where g
doesn't have to, you know,

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:20.692
carry the whole thing.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:21.944
We could even phase him out
at some point--

01:27:22.111 --> 01:27:23.320
are you nuts?

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.740
He's the guy they're interested in.
I don't understand your hesitation.

01:27:26.908 --> 01:27:29.743
Oh, wait a second. Wait.
I know.

01:27:29.911 --> 01:27:31.745
Yeah. I know, and I understand.

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:33.330
Yeah!

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:38.418
You're upset because I promised I'd take
care of you if this took off and I haven't.

01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:40.254
- Yet.
- Oh.

01:27:40.421 --> 01:27:46.760
But if you launch this,
and if you make it work,

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:50.430
then everything you've wanted,

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:55.269
everything that you have ever dreamed
about will be yours--

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:58.730
an office next to mine,

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:05.862
a view of the studio, a car,
the perks, the bonuses--

01:28:06.114 --> 01:28:10.450
everything will be yours.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:15.664
- And Kate?
- To hell with Kate.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:19.376
Do you wanna produce the show
or don't you?

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:22.296
Look, as far as I'm concerned,
Kate is indispensable.

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:25.299
We couldn't have gotten here
without Kate, and my deal

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:27.968
would have to be in place,
'cause, that's right,

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:30.137
you said the last show,
if I made that work--

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:35.225
I also said to get g signed up, and have
you done that, Mr. on-the-ball?

01:28:35.393 --> 01:28:38.520
- Yeah, he's been here.
- I don't see any paper.

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.564
Oh, well, that's just
a matter of signing.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:44.192
Why? He doesn't have a pen?
You get him signed up.

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:49.489
And then we'll talk your deal.

01:28:54.954 --> 01:28:57.956
Whether you're a lover of jazz,
gospel, classic or rock,

01:28:58.124 --> 01:29:01.335
you'll be able to select the kind
of sound that is going to fit

01:29:01.502 --> 01:29:03.253
whatever kind of music you enjoy.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:07.257
This is the stereo that really does
give you all kinds of features,

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:09.301
but it does it in a compact size.

01:29:09.469 --> 01:29:12.512
So if it's gonna go on a bookshelf,
if it's gonna go--

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:41.583
[clears throat]
Am I bothering you?

01:29:41.751 --> 01:29:44.878
No. How could you ever bother me?
I love talking to you.

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:47.381
That's what I wanted to do--
talk with you.

01:29:47.548 --> 01:29:49.049
Ricky and I were thinking--

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:53.428
[phone ringing]
Excuse me one second.
Hello?

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:56.848
Yes, Dr. Simon.

01:29:57.517 --> 01:30:00.519
[Chuckles]
So tell me, how long before
i can continue my journey?

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.403
How could it be chronic?

01:30:09.570 --> 01:30:14.449
Uh, how can it be chronic?
Well, it's chronic because--

01:30:14.617 --> 01:30:18.036
[whispering]

01:30:18.204 --> 01:30:23.041
It's chronic because of the decrease
that we registered in your--

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.426
[coughing]
I'm sorry, I got--

01:30:32.593 --> 01:30:35.220
I got a little phlegm there.
And--

01:30:35.388 --> 01:30:41.518
[coughing]
Yeah, the, um, the decrease
we registered in your "n--"

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:43.854
dolphins.
Endorphins!

01:30:44.021 --> 01:30:45.897
I'm sorry, I couldn't read
my own writing.

01:30:46.065 --> 01:30:48.608
You know, doctor's handwriting. Yes.

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:55.740
Uh, that number was sufficiently low,
so ass two--

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:08.920
as to demonstrate that
you have a poor heart.

01:31:12.258 --> 01:31:19.222
At this time, I'm--I'm, uh--

01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:21.808
I'm afraid, uh, that you,

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.935
uh, need to--

01:31:32.987 --> 01:31:34.321
stay on the floor!

01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:35.989
Uh, no, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:31:36.157 --> 01:31:39.326
I was, uh, giving instructions
to my dog.

01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.829
Yeah, I'm-I'm afraid that
this time you need to,

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:49.961
uh, stick around for several months,
or perhaps until the end of time.

01:31:53.049 --> 01:31:54.299
[Toy squeaking]

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.176
Uh, just a little
doctor joke there, g.

01:31:56.344 --> 01:31:57.844
[Squeaks]

01:31:58.012 --> 01:31:59.429
[Chuckling]
Yeah.

01:31:59.597 --> 01:32:01.348
No, I'm just calling to make sure
that you're okay.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:05.227
Yeah, I know that
you're disappointed.

01:32:05.394 --> 01:32:10.273
No, as soon as the heat breaks, I'll--
I'll call to make another appointment.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:14.402
Yeah, I'm sorry. Thanks.
Bye-bye.

01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:16.571
[Sighing]

01:32:16.739 --> 01:32:18.406
[Sighing]
Did he buy that?

01:32:18.574 --> 01:32:20.492
I think so.

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.287
He sounded awfully sad, though.

01:32:24.455 --> 01:32:26.373
He did?

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:29.376
Okay, now I can get him
to sign the contract.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:32.671
Oh my God.
Kate! Kate!

01:32:32.838 --> 01:32:34.214
What, what, what, what?

01:32:34.382 --> 01:32:35.715
No, what?
Where are you going?

01:32:35.883 --> 01:32:38.301
Ricky, how? G trusted you.
I trusted you.

01:32:38.469 --> 01:32:39.844
You can trust me.
Oh, please!

01:32:40.012 --> 01:32:42.847
Okay, honey, that was wrong.
That was wrong.

01:32:43.015 --> 01:32:44.099
Listen, sweetie,
don't be upset with me.

01:32:44.267 --> 01:32:45.559
I need--need more time.

01:32:45.726 --> 01:32:48.103
But don't be upset, not when
everything's goin' good for us.

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.229
Going good?

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.689
I just watched you lie to our friend.

01:32:50.856 --> 01:32:51.815
No, but that was isolated.

01:32:51.983 --> 01:32:53.233
I didn't wanna do it.
I'll tell you all about it.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:54.568
I had a meeting with
Mcbainbridge this morning.

I had this idea, which I alluded to last
night, about phasing him out eventually,

getting him to sign this contract.

01:33:00.199 --> 01:33:02.993
Oh, so all's fair, never mind what's
good or right for anybody else.

No, no, I think you're being irrational.

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.246
Trying to persuade me I'm stupid is
not a good way to win the argument.

about Ricky's contract.

01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:36.644
Or, no, better yet, give him a kiss.

01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:38.771
Give him a big kiss on the cheek.

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:40.106
[Applauding, laughing]

01:44:40.274 --> 01:44:41.607
It'll help him.

01:44:41.775 --> 01:44:42.942
[Laughing]

01:44:43.110 --> 01:44:45.778
Don't fight him, Mr. Mcbainbridge.
Ah, they're fighting like two bears.

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:48.447
Mr. Mcbainbridge.
Mr. Mcbainbridge.

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.449
We love you, Mr. Mcbainbridge. Yes.

01:44:50.617 --> 01:44:53.119
Oh, I like you too.
You too.

01:44:53.287 --> 01:44:57.039
You too.
What?

01:44:57.207 --> 01:44:59.166
[Ricky]
Say it. You're on TV. Say.

01:44:59.334 --> 01:45:00.751
[Phone ringing]

01:45:00.919 --> 01:45:02.044
Barry, there's a call for Ricky.

01:45:02.212 --> 01:45:06.048
[Chuckling]
Put it through to the floor.
Ricky, you've got a phone call.

01:45:06.216 --> 01:45:08.426
I do?

01:45:08.593 --> 01:45:10.177
Should I take a call? I--

01:45:10.345 --> 01:45:12.305
[audience]
Yes!

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:13.848
Okay. Hello.

01:45:14.016 --> 01:45:15.308
[Kate]
This isn't fair.

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.059
I should have my own show
to answer you on.

01:45:17.227 --> 01:45:18.978
- Kate?
- It's Kate!

01:45:19.146 --> 01:45:20.479
[Cheering]
Yeah!

01:45:20.647 --> 01:45:24.483
It's Kate.
That's nice.

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:28.404
You've been so public about your feelings.
I wish I could do the same.

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:30.698
Well, maybe QVC'll give you a show.
Where are you?

01:45:30.866 --> 01:45:33.159
I'm in the car racing to get to you.
I would have called--

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:35.119
[static]

01:45:35.287 --> 01:45:36.787
We lost her. Hello?
Hello?

01:45:36.955 --> 01:45:38.289
Hi, hi, there you are.
Where are you now?

01:45:38.457 --> 01:45:40.166
I'm so close. I'm at the studio.
I'll see you at the front.

01:45:40.334 --> 01:45:42.460
I'll see you at the front door.

01:45:42.627 --> 01:45:43.836
[Applause]

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.129
What do I do?

01:45:45.297 --> 01:45:46.714
- What do we do? I don't know.
- Stay with him. Stay with him.

01:45:46.882 --> 01:45:49.091
I'm on it.

01:45:51.386 --> 01:45:53.679
Brutus, brutus, you're missing
all the good stuff, brutus.

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:56.557
Move it, move it!

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.394
Kate!

01:46:01.980 --> 01:46:04.065
[Cheering]

01:46:06.276 --> 01:46:08.402
[Crying]

01:46:08.570 --> 01:46:11.030
They're so sweet together.
Yeah.

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:13.991
Yeah, okay. Now move around.

01:46:14.701 --> 01:46:17.453
Move to the left. Move to the left.
Come around. Come around left.

01:46:17.621 --> 01:46:21.123
Yeah. Oh, that's beautiful. Oh, that's
great. That's great, guys.

01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:24.502
Oh, this is great stuff.
This is great stuff.

01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:26.879
[Chuckling]
Come here.

01:46:27.047 --> 01:46:28.255
[Barry]
Oh, they're taking off.

01:46:28.423 --> 01:46:30.049
Go with them again.
Follow them again.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:31.842
Keep goin', keep goin'.
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:46:32.010 --> 01:46:34.553
Stay with them.
Don't do that!

01:46:34.721 --> 01:46:37.515
Way to go, Ricky.
Way to go.

01:46:38.141 --> 01:46:39.475
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:41.268
I'm so sorry.
It doesn't matter.

01:46:41.436 --> 01:46:44.271
I love you.

01:46:44.439 --> 01:46:46.982
[Whispering]
I love you, Kate.

01:46:59.746 --> 01:47:02.498
[Kate]
Good-byes are so sad.

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:06.043
Yes, some good-byes are very sad.

01:47:06.211 --> 01:47:08.796
And other good-byes are like,
"hallelujah, that pajama-wearing,

01:47:08.964 --> 01:47:13.342
urine-sipping, floor-sleeping freak
has left my house forever."

01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:15.803
[Laughing]
That really was herbal tea,
right?

01:47:15.971 --> 01:47:17.304
I don't know, Robert.

01:47:17.472 --> 01:47:19.098
[Laughing]

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:20.766
Maybe you'll come back.

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:23.936
You know, winters are
really great down here.

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:28.983
We're gonna be together whenever
we think about each other.

01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:32.069
For me, I promise
that'll be every night.

01:47:32.904 --> 01:47:34.697
Good-byes are sad.
Especially this good-bye.

01:47:34.865 --> 01:47:37.658
I really don't wanna say good-bye.
Uh-uh.

01:47:40.454 --> 01:47:43.664
Kate.

01:47:54.092 --> 01:47:57.094
Robert Ricky.

01:48:01.641 --> 01:48:05.769
Your good is better.
Your better is blessed.
