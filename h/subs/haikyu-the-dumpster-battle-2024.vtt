WEBVTT

01:00.666 --> 01:01.500
No way.

01:09.875 --> 01:13.541
Whatever. I just need
to get to the camp on time.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.458
What are you doing?

01:50.583 --> 01:53.958
Well… I guess… I'm lost?

01:56.333 --> 01:57.583
Are you from out of town?

02:07.000 --> 02:08.500
Is that fun?

02:10.750 --> 02:14.416
I'm just playing to kill time.

02:18.041 --> 02:19.291
Do you play volleyball?

02:20.625 --> 02:23.541
Those are volleyball shoes.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.875
I'm in the volleyball club too.

02:27.375 --> 02:29.166
I'm Shoyo Hinata.

02:30.333 --> 02:32.958
Kenma Kozume.

02:36.708 --> 02:37.958
Do you like volleyball?

02:39.208 --> 02:40.166
Just okay.

02:40.666 --> 02:42.083
It just happens that I'm playing it.

02:42.791 --> 02:46.583
Although I don't hate it,
I don't like being tired.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.125
<i>But my friend plays.</i>

02:50.625 --> 02:52.833
<i>If I don't play,</i>
<i>I think it will trouble him.</i>

02:55.041 --> 02:58.166
If you like it,
it's even more fun to play.

02:58.250 --> 02:59.208
It doesn't matter.

02:59.291 --> 03:01.958
I won't play after I graduate.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.833
<i>Kenma, wake up!</i>

03:30.875 --> 03:32.916
Everyone's gone for breakfast.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.458
Come on. Wake up.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.583
Wake up!

03:45.916 --> 03:47.166
<i>Good morning!</i>

03:47.250 --> 03:48.333
<i>The day has finally come!</i>

03:48.416 --> 03:49.291
<i>I'm so excited!</i>

03:49.375 --> 03:50.208
FROM HINATA

03:50.291 --> 03:51.875
Is that from Chibi-chan?

03:54.166 --> 03:57.500
He could easily send a message
to an opponent he's about to face.

03:57.583 --> 03:58.750
What an interesting guy.

03:59.791 --> 04:03.083
I'm sure Chibi-chan
will go all out to beat you.

04:05.416 --> 04:08.958
It's only natural
that he wants to win the tournament.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.375
I'm not talking about the match.

04:11.458 --> 04:12.583
I'm talking about you.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.416
I don't get it.

04:17.583 --> 04:18.416
SENT

04:18.500 --> 04:22.875
KAKESU INN

04:23.458 --> 04:25.583
FROM KENMA KOZUME: THAT'S RIGHT

04:26.666 --> 04:30.791
Even if Kenma loses,
he probably wouldn't think much of it.

04:32.583 --> 04:35.208
But I have to beat him!

04:52.666 --> 04:59.666
MAIN TITLE

05:08.208 --> 05:09.041
COURT A: NEKOMA VS KARASUNO

05:09.125 --> 05:12.583
Mr. Nekomata,
the dumpster battle is about to begin.

05:14.625 --> 05:19.791
But we didn't come here
so that we could play Karasuno.

05:20.583 --> 05:27.125
It's just that more people
are looking forward to this game.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.416
That includes me.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.000
- Let's go!
- All right!

05:33.083 --> 05:34.000
JAPAN VOLLEYBALL

05:34.083 --> 05:38.541
These kids don't know
about our rivalry back then.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.708
Mr. Nekomata.

05:43.750 --> 05:45.666
Let's have a good game today.

05:46.875 --> 05:49.083
We're ready to win.

05:51.458 --> 05:52.791
I accept your challenge.

05:55.375 --> 06:00.000
Well, if it isn't the Karasuno team,
the diving experts.

06:03.666 --> 06:06.166
We've got you guys to thank.

06:07.375 --> 06:08.250
FLY

06:08.333 --> 06:10.291
You've come to watch the games
two days in a row.

06:10.875 --> 06:13.708
You said otherwise, but you came
to cheer for Nekoma, didn't you?

06:15.250 --> 06:16.208
No!

06:16.291 --> 06:19.541
I came to watch Nekoma lose!

06:20.291 --> 06:21.958
You're not being honest.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.000
TOKYO METROPOLITAN NEKOMA HIGH SCHOOL

06:23.083 --> 06:24.833
I'm serious.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.000
Let's have a good game!

06:29.625 --> 06:32.291
Let's get fired up!

06:32.875 --> 06:36.000
We can't let them beat us in cheering!

06:36.083 --> 06:39.541
Go, go, Nekoma!

06:39.625 --> 06:42.958
Push it, push it, Nekoma!

06:43.041 --> 06:44.291
FLY

06:44.375 --> 06:46.125
Go, go, Nekoma!

06:46.208 --> 06:47.291
Push it, push it, Nekoma!

06:47.875 --> 06:49.000
I'm so jealous.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.083
I want to play Karasuno and Nekoma too.

06:52.166 --> 06:53.000
Yes.

06:53.083 --> 06:56.458
Yamamoto, you can do it!

06:57.166 --> 06:59.333
All eyes on me!

06:59.416 --> 07:02.000
As expected of Tokyo's home team,
the cheerleaders are amazing.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.166
Who cares if they're the home team?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.125
Come on, Kenma.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.333
Let's stop that dynamic duo.

07:08.833 --> 07:12.333
After all, it's toughest
when our defense gets breached.

07:12.833 --> 07:17.083
<i>Kenma has almost no interest</i>
<i>in winning the game.</i>

07:17.166 --> 07:19.875
<i>Words like that don't motivate him.</i>

07:20.458 --> 07:24.083
<i>He only analyzes</i>
<i>whether it's possible or not.</i>

07:25.166 --> 07:26.833
<i>Will it be possible or not?</i>

07:28.625 --> 07:30.041
I have no idea.

07:34.250 --> 07:35.708
All right. Let's do our chant.

07:45.416 --> 07:47.291
We are plasma.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.500
Let's make our motions fluid.

07:49.583 --> 07:51.458
Keep the oxygen flowing,

07:52.041 --> 07:55.416
so the brain can work
to its full potential.

07:55.500 --> 07:58.458
Let's devour our opponents!

07:58.541 --> 08:00.833
Let's go!

08:02.166 --> 08:05.291
Let me introduce
the starting members of each team.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.625
First up is Karasuno High School,

08:07.708 --> 08:10.750
who defeated a front-runner,
Inarizaki High, yesterday.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.666
Number 1 is the captain,
the pillar of Karasuno,

08:13.750 --> 08:16.166
- the wing spiker, Daichi Sawamura.
- Make some noise!

08:16.750 --> 08:21.666
Number 3 is the wing spiker,
the ace of Karasuno, Asahi Azumane.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.250
Number 5 is Ryunosuke Tanaka,
a junior wing spiker

08:25.333 --> 08:28.625
who is rapidly improving
in this tournament.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.333
Number 9 is Tobio Kageyama,

08:31.416 --> 08:34.083
a freshman setter
who's gaining a lot of attention.

08:34.666 --> 08:36.625
Number 10 is also interesting.

08:36.708 --> 08:40.041
He is the shortest middle blocker
in the tournament, Shoyo Hinata.

08:40.708 --> 08:46.250
Number 11 is the team's tallest blocker,
the middle blocker, Kei Tsukishima.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.291
The libero is Number 4,

08:48.375 --> 08:51.208
the Guardian Deity
and the mood maker, Yu Nishinoya.

08:51.791 --> 08:54.250
Their team leader is Coach Ittetsu Takeda.

08:54.750 --> 08:58.375
Since Coach Takeda
has no volleyball experience,

08:58.458 --> 09:01.833
<i>the actual coach is Coach Keishin Ukai.</i>

09:01.916 --> 09:03.750
A FATEFUL SHOWDOWN
SPRING TOURNAMENT, ROUND 3

09:05.041 --> 09:06.125
That's my grandson.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.750
Amazing!

09:08.833 --> 09:10.333
He's so young.

09:11.166 --> 09:12.916
You two look alike.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.041
MR. IKKEI UKAI

09:14.125 --> 09:15.000
CONNECT

09:15.083 --> 09:16.541
Next up is Nekoma High School.

09:17.458 --> 09:19.916
Number 1 is the captain, Tetsuro Kuroo.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.208
He's an all-around middle blocker.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.041
Number 2 is stable
in both offense and defense,

09:25.125 --> 09:29.166
the calm senior wing spiker, Nobuyuki Kai.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.750
Number 4 is the junior ace,
Taketora Yamamoto.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.125
He's Nekoma's main powerhouse.

09:34.958 --> 09:36.958
- Shut up, Tora.
- Number 5 is the "brain" of Nekoma,

09:37.041 --> 09:39.000
the setter, Kenma Kozume.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.833
He's shown us a lot of amazing plays
in this tournament.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.833
Number 6's ever-changing tactic
is creating a buzz.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.833
A junior wing spiker, Shohei Fukunaga.

09:49.583 --> 09:53.625
Number 11's huge body and ball sense
are slowly making him Nekoma's ace.

09:53.708 --> 09:55.666
- A freshman middle blocker,
- Please toss the ball to me!

09:55.750 --> 09:56.750
Lev Haiba.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.833
- Are you stupid?
- The libero is Number 3,

09:58.916 --> 10:01.875
Nekoma's defensive ace, Morisuke Yaku.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.833
<i>Their team leader</i>
<i>is Coach Yasufumi Nekomata.</i>

10:05.750 --> 10:08.208
That's Master's rival, right?

10:08.291 --> 10:09.750
It's Coach Bakeneko.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.750
No, it's Coach Nekomata.

10:12.250 --> 10:15.166
Master, don't you want to join
this tournament too?

10:16.125 --> 10:18.208
It's not like that.

10:19.458 --> 10:23.041
Although my name isn't
in the Spring Tournament brochure,

10:23.125 --> 10:25.833
my disciple is there.

10:26.416 --> 10:28.833
<i>My kin is also there.</i>

10:30.041 --> 10:31.875
I have no regrets.

10:33.000 --> 10:37.250
<i>This match belongs to these kids now.</i>

10:37.750 --> 10:41.916
<i>But we didn't get this far on our own.</i>

10:42.000 --> 10:45.125
<i>All of them clearly know this.</i>

10:45.875 --> 10:49.041
<i>So, enjoy the game, Grandpa.</i>

10:54.041 --> 10:54.875
Got it!

10:59.041 --> 11:01.500
- It's up!
- Nice receive!

11:07.166 --> 11:08.375
Follow up, please!

11:13.791 --> 11:15.208
<i>That's way too strong!</i>

11:15.291 --> 11:16.958
Chance ball!

11:18.083 --> 11:19.458
Left!

11:21.583 --> 11:23.250
<i>I'll surprise you with my spike!</i>

11:25.333 --> 11:26.958
Taketora, nice receive!

11:27.041 --> 11:28.416
<i>It flew too far.</i>

11:31.750 --> 11:33.375
Nice receive!

11:44.416 --> 11:45.708
Lately, I've been thinking.

11:46.416 --> 11:47.541
About what?

11:47.625 --> 11:49.375
You're so fun to play against, Shoyo.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.875
So, I want to face you guys
in a real match.

11:56.916 --> 12:00.625
A match where losing means
an instant game over.

12:03.583 --> 12:04.875
<i>Let's do it.</i>

12:13.083 --> 12:14.833
- He's so strong!
- All right!

12:16.458 --> 12:17.791
He's so fast!

12:23.041 --> 12:26.250
Let's play a game
with no second chances, Kenma!

12:31.291 --> 12:34.666
Let's go wild!

12:38.125 --> 12:41.333
HOTEL MATATABI

12:42.458 --> 12:47.000
Ever since Shoyo entered
the nationals, he's changed.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.875
He might not use his skills
right from the start.

12:55.875 --> 12:58.125
But he's still super fast.

12:58.625 --> 12:59.916
I agree.

13:00.500 --> 13:05.958
Chibi-chan is gradually using
the minus tempo attack as a decoy.

13:07.291 --> 13:10.250
The last practice match we had with them
was last October, right?

13:10.750 --> 13:13.416
You mean he's evolved since then?

13:14.583 --> 13:15.541
You've got to be kidding me.

13:16.625 --> 13:20.208
He will try to bait us with it
as if it's a cat teaser.

13:23.458 --> 13:26.208
Looks like someone on our side
has evolved too.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.833
<i>Synchronized attack!</i>

13:36.083 --> 13:36.916
One-touch!

13:37.000 --> 13:38.375
Nice touch!

13:38.458 --> 13:39.416
Cover!

13:41.333 --> 13:42.833
<i>Synchronized attack…</i>

13:42.916 --> 13:44.375
<i>All!</i>

13:45.500 --> 13:47.125
<i>All five of them are attacking?</i>

13:53.791 --> 13:58.041
Kuroo! Kuroo! Great play!

13:59.166 --> 14:00.625
This guy…

14:01.875 --> 14:04.333
- Nekoma also did a synchronized attack.
- Shake it off!

14:04.416 --> 14:05.833
Cats versus crows.

14:05.916 --> 14:07.791
They're both omnivores.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.958
Actually, real cats are carnivores.

14:10.750 --> 14:11.666
I see.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.458
This is the first time we're doing
a five-man synchronized attack on Nekoma.

14:15.541 --> 14:17.958
I didn't expect Kuroo to keep up.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.625
After all, Kuroo

14:20.708 --> 14:23.958
is the master of Tsukishima,
the tenacious blocker.

14:24.041 --> 14:28.291
The reason we broke through was because
your hand went straight up again, right?

14:28.875 --> 14:32.833
I told you to put your hand forward,
Nobukatsu-kun.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.875
Are you handing out advice?

14:34.958 --> 14:36.750
You're as carefree as ever.

14:36.833 --> 14:40.000
No, I just want to pick a fight.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.708
Don't lose, Tsukki!

14:42.791 --> 14:44.083
- Counterattack!
- <i>Kuroo,</i>

14:44.166 --> 14:47.166
<i>you said something</i>
<i>to piss Tsukishima off again, didn't you?</i>

14:47.250 --> 14:49.125
NEKOMA: 7, KARASUNO: 7

14:49.708 --> 14:51.083
Nice serve!

14:52.750 --> 14:53.750
Front!

14:55.666 --> 14:56.625
Left!

15:02.833 --> 15:04.458
It's Small Fry's receive.

15:05.041 --> 15:07.083
- It's going over the net.
- Push it over, Hinata!

15:10.125 --> 15:11.250
Got it!

15:18.166 --> 15:20.083
That was loud.

15:21.541 --> 15:25.125
Yu, you get better every time we meet.

15:25.208 --> 15:27.166
Thank you, Morisuke!

15:27.750 --> 15:31.875
He used to crash down
with the ball until recently.

15:32.625 --> 15:33.958
I know it's natural,

15:34.041 --> 15:38.041
but they're a different team
from the first practice match.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.125
How scary.

15:40.708 --> 15:43.041
That's how omnivores are.

15:44.125 --> 15:48.041
<i>They grow by eating bigger opponents</i>
<i>than themselves.</i>

15:49.875 --> 15:53.416
Now, how do we win?

15:55.291 --> 15:57.416
NEKOMA: 8, KARASUNO: 9

15:57.500 --> 15:59.125
Go!

16:00.416 --> 16:01.833
Chance ball!

16:01.916 --> 16:03.208
It's coming back!

16:05.166 --> 16:08.041
- Amazing!
- Keep it up!

16:08.125 --> 16:09.375
Okay.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.750
<i>These guys are different from before.</i>

16:12.833 --> 16:14.708
<i>We have to do what we always do.</i>

16:14.791 --> 16:16.666
<i>Feel them out and adapt.</i>

16:16.750 --> 16:18.458
<i>Then, see through them.</i>

16:18.958 --> 16:20.583
Left!

16:23.625 --> 16:25.083
That was so cool!

16:25.166 --> 16:27.750
<i>I wonder how many spikes</i>
<i>we'll have to do today.</i>

16:28.708 --> 16:31.708
Go, Tsukishima! Don't lose to Kuroo!

16:31.791 --> 16:34.291
- Don't lose to him!
- Suga's all fired up again today.

16:34.375 --> 16:35.208
You hear me, Tsukishima?

16:35.291 --> 16:37.916
- He doesn't look it, but he's excited.
- Hey, Tsukishima! You hear me?

16:38.500 --> 16:39.833
I can't do it.

16:42.958 --> 16:44.500
<i>He's on the court now.</i>

16:45.708 --> 16:50.125
I never thought of beating
anyone stronger than me.

16:50.208 --> 16:54.375
There's no way I can beat you, Kuroo.

16:54.875 --> 16:58.041
I've never had any thoughts
that I could beat you on my own.

16:59.416 --> 17:02.750
But it looks like
he's trying to beat us on his own?

17:03.333 --> 17:04.708
You're right.

17:05.333 --> 17:08.333
He's the guy who surpassed me, after all.

17:11.875 --> 17:13.583
Yamaguchi, nice serve!

17:14.083 --> 17:15.958
- Bring it on.
- <i>Come at us!</i>

17:18.583 --> 17:19.541
Got it!

17:23.500 --> 17:25.333
Great shot!

17:25.416 --> 17:28.291
- All right!
- That was awesome!

17:28.375 --> 17:30.541
The ball just twisted, didn't it?

17:31.708 --> 17:33.250
That was a nice serve.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.291
It was right in front of you,
but it floated again, didn't it?

17:37.375 --> 17:38.208
Shake it off.

17:38.291 --> 17:40.875
Tadashi, you're all grown up.

17:40.958 --> 17:41.958
That's my boy.

17:42.041 --> 17:43.375
It's not like he's your son.

17:43.958 --> 17:45.750
Do it again!

17:51.166 --> 17:53.666
<i>The same trick won't work on Nekoma!</i>

17:56.458 --> 17:57.458
Nice receive!

18:01.000 --> 18:02.125
<i>That's more than enough.</i>

18:06.125 --> 18:10.291
<i>I told you to put your hand forward,</i>
<i>Justin Clubb.</i>

18:14.458 --> 18:17.083
All right!

18:20.833 --> 18:23.000
Did you see our Tsukki?

18:23.083 --> 18:25.500
Tsukishima isn't on our team, Bokuto.

18:32.791 --> 18:33.958
Nice block!

18:34.041 --> 18:35.541
Your serve was great too.

18:36.500 --> 18:38.958
- It's all your fault!
- Ouch!

18:39.041 --> 18:41.875
What are you talking about?
That was all Tsukki!

18:41.958 --> 18:44.583
That height was higher than expected.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.666
The guy that's full of surprises.

18:49.166 --> 18:52.291
Tsukki, how's volleyball
been for you lately?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.541
Thanks to you,

18:59.916 --> 19:02.791
it's rare, but I'm starting to enjoy it.

19:04.541 --> 19:07.416
I never thought I'd hear Tsukki say that.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.958
Kenma, you should learn from him.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.458
Yamaguchi, one more time!

19:17.791 --> 19:19.583
- Nice receive!
- Right!

19:20.958 --> 19:22.750
All right!

19:22.833 --> 19:23.833
NEKOMA: 9, KARASUNO: 12

19:26.000 --> 19:27.041
Dammit!

19:27.750 --> 19:29.708
You should feel great about just now.

19:30.375 --> 19:34.125
But I understand your feeling
of wanting to score more points.

19:34.791 --> 19:37.625
All right! It's my turn!

19:40.083 --> 19:42.166
Yamamoto, nice serve!

19:43.791 --> 19:45.208
I'm sorry!

19:45.291 --> 19:46.250
Chance ball!

19:49.625 --> 19:50.541
<i>It's too long!</i>

19:50.625 --> 19:51.666
Asahi!

19:54.125 --> 19:55.708
All right!

19:55.791 --> 19:58.500
We have a chance
as long as we touch the ball.

19:58.583 --> 20:01.333
Don't bother doing an A-pass
if it's going over the net.

20:01.416 --> 20:02.583
Sorry!

20:02.666 --> 20:05.041
You can't call it an A-pass
if it goes over the net.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.083
You're right.

20:06.166 --> 20:07.958
I get it, okay?

20:08.458 --> 20:10.291
Kageyama is amazing!

20:11.333 --> 20:13.000
Your pass doesn't have to be near the net.

20:13.083 --> 20:16.125
Just make sure it's over the attack line.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.083
<i>He's acting all cool.</i>

20:19.833 --> 20:21.333
Kenma, did you hear that?

20:21.416 --> 20:23.541
He said something really cool.

20:23.625 --> 20:24.916
I heard it.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.791
But that's their business.

20:26.875 --> 20:28.458
It has nothing to do with us.

20:28.541 --> 20:29.791
What are you, our mom?

20:29.875 --> 20:33.625
- We don't have to fight over everything.
- Hinata, nice serve!

20:34.333 --> 20:35.708
Fukunaga!

20:35.791 --> 20:36.958
Setter!

20:38.000 --> 20:39.125
- Got it!
- Please!

20:42.166 --> 20:43.541
<i>It's actually the other side?</i>

20:45.583 --> 20:47.291
Nice kill!

20:48.708 --> 20:50.333
Wait, are you kidding me?

20:52.125 --> 20:54.166
That was close. They almost got it.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.666
That was so close.

20:56.750 --> 21:00.541
Just when you think you're going to score,
they send it right back at us.

21:01.125 --> 21:03.583
Nekoma does that a lot, so be careful.

21:06.250 --> 21:10.083
<i>Kageyama jumped to the right just now,</i>

21:10.166 --> 21:12.541
but he tossed the ball
to the left so cleanly.

21:13.041 --> 21:13.958
Yes.

21:14.041 --> 21:17.958
And the spiker predicted
that he would do that.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.583
That was amazing.

21:21.083 --> 21:24.166
<i>Out of fear comes interest and respect.</i>

21:24.250 --> 21:28.500
<i>Excitement and respect</i>
<i>stem from strong opponents in a showdown.</i>

21:29.416 --> 21:31.041
That's great.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.666
<i>But he's the only one</i>
<i>who's slightly different.</i>

21:35.750 --> 21:39.791
- <i>It's a fateful showdown of skills.</i>
- Bring it on!

21:39.875 --> 21:42.875
<i>If we lose, the seniors will retire.</i>

21:43.666 --> 21:47.500
<i>I don't think</i>
<i>he's interested in any of that.</i>

21:47.583 --> 21:53.041
<i>All he's thinking about</i>
<i>is how to snap the crows' wings.</i>

21:57.500 --> 21:58.625
Asahi!

22:02.916 --> 22:06.041
How much more attacking power
can Karasuno unleash?

22:06.125 --> 22:09.333
But it's looking good.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.541
For which team? Nekoma?

22:12.583 --> 22:13.791
They're behind right now though.

22:13.875 --> 22:14.708
NEKOMA: 17, KARASUNO: 20

22:14.791 --> 22:18.708
<i>It's common for Nekoma</i>
<i>to be behind in the first set.</i>

22:18.791 --> 22:22.958
<i>But during that time, they prioritize</i>
<i>studying the opponent's attacks.</i>

22:23.041 --> 22:25.583
<i>Then they slowly catch up</i>
<i>in the second half.</i>

22:25.666 --> 22:27.291
<i>That's Nekoma's style.</i>

22:27.375 --> 22:30.458
<i>But this time,</i>
<i>against a powerful opponent,</i>

22:30.541 --> 22:34.125
<i>they have a tight grip on Karasuno</i>
<i>right from the start.</i>

22:34.208 --> 22:38.083
I think Nekoma has the advantage
in this situation.

22:38.166 --> 22:39.000
Daichi!

22:39.083 --> 22:41.458
- It's too long!
- Kageyama, go for it!

22:41.541 --> 22:43.541
Block him, Lev!

22:44.458 --> 22:46.166
<i>Go, Lev!</i>

22:46.250 --> 22:47.916
<i>Although you're no match for him</i>
<i>technique-wise,</i>

22:48.000 --> 22:51.416
<i>at least use your height</i>
<i>and momentum to stop him!</i>

22:56.000 --> 22:56.875
Kenma!

22:58.958 --> 23:00.583
<i>He moved so fast!</i>

23:03.958 --> 23:05.791
All right!

23:05.875 --> 23:08.083
Lev!

23:08.166 --> 23:09.000
Score!

23:09.083 --> 23:10.791
That was a bit low.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.125
I know.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.291
Kozume, you…

23:15.208 --> 23:16.500
You can move too.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.333
Well, I'm alive after all.

23:21.833 --> 23:25.041
Kenma, you're just as good as Kageyama.

23:25.125 --> 23:26.416
What did you say?

23:27.291 --> 23:28.583
Are you that pissed?

23:28.666 --> 23:32.291
Grouping me up with such a diligent guy
is rude to him.

23:33.208 --> 23:36.291
But when I see extraordinary techniques,

23:37.333 --> 23:42.083
I feel like the things I can do
get updated as well.

23:45.791 --> 23:50.916
But just like us, there's no way
they'll be the same as before.

23:54.208 --> 23:56.083
NEKOMA: 20, KARASUNO: 21

23:58.125 --> 23:59.125
Nice serve!

24:00.125 --> 24:01.041
Got it!

24:02.958 --> 24:04.166
Nice receive!

24:04.250 --> 24:06.625
<i>Of course, you'd get that, you dumbass!</i>

24:06.708 --> 24:07.541
Left!

24:07.625 --> 24:10.083
<i>Hinata's receiving isn't a hole</i>
<i>in our defense anymore!</i>

24:12.458 --> 24:14.750
<i>Three players came to block me!</i>

24:14.833 --> 24:18.708
Don't just stand there and be satisfied
just because you bumped the ball!

24:18.791 --> 24:21.291
I know that!

24:35.791 --> 24:36.625
NEKOMA: 25, KARASUNO: 25

24:36.708 --> 24:37.916
Center!

24:39.500 --> 24:40.375
One-touch!

24:41.416 --> 24:43.333
- Fukunaga!
- Left!

24:43.916 --> 24:45.583
- Kageyama!
- Sorry, please follow up!

24:45.666 --> 24:46.458
- Left!
- Asahi!

24:46.541 --> 24:47.333
Hey.

24:47.416 --> 24:49.541
It's only the first set.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.291
Everyone's hustling.

24:56.416 --> 24:57.875
- Sorry, that was too hard.
- I could feel it breaking.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.333
Kenma, it's all yours!

25:08.875 --> 25:11.625
- That was so cool!
- All right!

25:11.708 --> 25:12.583
No!

25:14.791 --> 25:16.125
A reach over foul.

25:17.333 --> 25:21.916
<i>He pretended to dump the ball</i>
<i>and baited the blockers to commit a foul.</i>

25:23.375 --> 25:25.458
<i>I think I'm pretty good at that.</i>

25:26.625 --> 25:28.375
Just one more point!

25:28.458 --> 25:29.791
NEKOMA: 26, KARASUNO: 25

25:32.791 --> 25:34.000
Nice receive!

25:34.083 --> 25:35.083
Go!

25:35.666 --> 25:37.291
<i>Synchronized attack!</i>

25:37.916 --> 25:39.375
This technique again?

25:43.583 --> 25:44.458
Got it!

25:46.291 --> 25:47.541
Chance ball!

25:51.083 --> 25:54.083
<i>Karasuno chooses</i>
<i>to go for a synchronized attack.</i>

25:54.166 --> 25:56.958
Don't let Nekoma's block fool you.

26:01.291 --> 26:02.541
Last ball!

26:04.500 --> 26:05.916
They have no choice but to toss it back!

26:06.000 --> 26:07.833
Chance ball!

26:12.125 --> 26:13.750
<i>It's coming back!</i>

26:13.833 --> 26:15.458
<i>One more time!</i>

26:16.208 --> 26:17.166
<i>Securing approach distance.</i>

26:17.750 --> 26:18.875
<i>We got this!</i>

26:35.250 --> 26:37.625
What the heck happened?

26:37.708 --> 26:40.208
Karasuno was staring at each other
on the court!

26:40.291 --> 26:42.875
Karasuno lost the first set.

26:42.958 --> 26:45.125
Nekoma takes the first set!

26:45.208 --> 26:46.041
NEKOMA: 27, KARASUNO: 25

26:46.125 --> 26:49.791
But even if that was a mistake,

26:51.333 --> 26:56.708
<i>Kozume's return was aimed</i>
<i>at a perfect seam between the spikers</i>

26:56.791 --> 26:59.125
<i>when they were about to go on an offense.</i>

26:59.875 --> 27:04.166
<i>It was in Kageyama's path</i>
<i>as he ran forward to set the ball.</i>

27:04.250 --> 27:05.958
<i>It was also a spot</i>
<i>where the other players crossed paths.</i>

27:06.041 --> 27:09.125
<i>What's more amazing is that he aimed</i>
<i>at the opposite side of the libero.</i>

27:10.125 --> 27:15.625
Karasuno is more aggressive at attacking
compared to other schools.

27:16.125 --> 27:21.583
They made that mistake just now
because they were too eager to attack.

27:22.083 --> 27:23.541
Their strength became their weakness.

27:23.625 --> 27:28.458
Or should I say,
Kozume took advantage of their strength?

27:31.750 --> 27:36.375
Everyone from Karasuno
has turned into Shoyo.

27:39.250 --> 27:41.833
I hope Chibi-chan stays
forever energetic like now.

27:42.625 --> 27:43.708
What the heck?

27:47.958 --> 27:50.375
People often question
why I was selected to play.

27:51.375 --> 27:54.625
I'm not particularly good at sports.

27:56.125 --> 27:58.750
Then, let me ask you.
Is your school strong?

28:00.041 --> 28:01.166
Strong?

28:02.125 --> 28:06.458
I heard it used to be strong,
but it declined.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.875
But lately,

28:11.791 --> 28:13.208
I think we're very strong.

28:14.958 --> 28:16.916
Which school are you from?

28:17.000 --> 28:17.958
Kenma!

28:19.291 --> 28:20.416
It's Kuroo.

28:21.041 --> 28:23.250
- Well, I'm off.
- Kenma!

28:25.625 --> 28:27.375
See you, Shoyo.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.333
"See you"?

28:34.583 --> 28:35.875
That's unusual.

28:37.666 --> 28:39.416
You don't know him, do you?

28:40.041 --> 28:44.916
I've never seen
you speak so kindly to a stranger.

28:45.416 --> 28:46.833
That's because…

28:50.500 --> 28:51.666
<i>I wonder why.</i>

28:52.500 --> 28:54.750
Go, go, Nekoma!

28:55.250 --> 28:57.416
Karasuno is under a lot of pressure.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.625
Yes.

28:59.583 --> 29:04.166
It would be great if we could score
with a powerful service ace.

29:04.666 --> 29:06.541
We haven't been able to do that yet.

29:07.250 --> 29:09.791
Whoever can do a service ace,
please go ahead.

29:09.875 --> 29:10.750
Yes.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.666
"Whoever wants extra side dishes,
please go ahead."

29:13.750 --> 29:15.416
That's saying the same thing.

29:15.500 --> 29:16.916
Remember what you said, Kuroo?

29:17.416 --> 29:20.291
There's no perfect strategy
for any kind of play.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.666
Let's say Shoyo can score ten points
on a regular basis.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.291
We just need to keep him
from scoring two or three points.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.583
Kenma is more proactive today.

29:30.375 --> 29:33.500
NEKOMA: 0, KARASUNO: 0

29:36.041 --> 29:40.125
Switch gears and begin the counterattack!

29:40.208 --> 29:42.166
Bring it on!

29:45.125 --> 29:46.750
<i>Is it aimed at Number 10 again?</i>

29:46.833 --> 29:48.083
Got it!

29:49.208 --> 29:50.458
<i>He can't attack like this.</i>

29:50.541 --> 29:54.250
<i>They're purposely letting Hinata receive</i>
<i>to shut down the quick attack.</i>

29:59.708 --> 30:02.583
Wow, he slid.

30:02.666 --> 30:04.000
A slide attack.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.666
Nice play, Hinata!

30:10.458 --> 30:14.708
<i>He didn't have to</i>
<i>let Shoyo attack just now.</i>

30:14.791 --> 30:15.625
<i>But…</i>

30:16.708 --> 30:20.416
<i>Don't dream of stopping</i>
<i>a quick attack with that.</i>

30:23.583 --> 30:26.208
- The shot was too easy to bump.
- It seems so.

30:26.291 --> 30:30.458
<i>But I think that was a good one.</i>

30:31.458 --> 30:32.500
Shoyo.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.458
Keep being interesting.

30:37.958 --> 30:39.250
Let's score again!

30:41.625 --> 30:43.875
What's wrong, Hinata?

30:44.750 --> 30:46.291
NEKOMA: 0, KARASUNO: 1

30:46.375 --> 30:49.541
<i>If they take another set, it's over.</i>

30:50.041 --> 30:51.875
- Nice receive!
- "What if we lose?"

30:52.708 --> 30:56.291
You can't think of such things
that would dampen your spirits.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.083
That's how you use
"dampen your spirits", right?

30:59.166 --> 31:00.041
That's right.

31:00.916 --> 31:02.375
<i>Don't think about the future.</i>

31:02.458 --> 31:04.166
<i>Look at the present.</i>

31:04.916 --> 31:09.041
<i>See how much stronger we've become.</i>

31:12.375 --> 31:14.333
All right!

31:14.416 --> 31:15.250
Nice judgment call.

31:15.833 --> 31:18.541
Bokuto, you're too intimidating.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.375
- Sorry for that.
- It's okay.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.583
<i>You reminded me of something</i>
<i>I'd never thought of before.</i>

31:26.791 --> 31:28.291
It was a revelation.

31:29.166 --> 31:31.041
NEKOMA: 6, KARASUNO: 7

31:31.833 --> 31:34.500
<i>The persistent Nekoma team</i>
<i>is behind by one point again.</i>

31:34.583 --> 31:36.250
NEKOMA: 1, KARASUNO: 0

31:36.833 --> 31:38.458
They were in the lead initially, right?

31:38.541 --> 31:41.916
How did they lose the first set
when I came back from the toilet?

31:42.000 --> 31:42.708
Yes.

31:42.791 --> 31:46.416
- That's hilarious.
- <i>Why don't you watch on your tablet?</i>

31:47.666 --> 31:48.875
<i>That serve was a little short.</i>

31:49.458 --> 31:50.916
<i>And it looked like</i>
<i>he was aiming for Hinata.</i>

31:51.000 --> 31:52.791
Nekoma as opponents?

31:52.875 --> 31:55.916
I'd never want to play against them.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.000
But it's a good game to watch.

31:58.500 --> 31:59.583
<i>It's up again!</i>

31:59.666 --> 32:00.875
<i>They just won't let their opponents score.</i>

32:00.958 --> 32:02.708
Karasuno's in dire straits.

32:02.791 --> 32:05.333
They must be frustrated
that they can't score.

32:05.416 --> 32:06.458
They must be really annoyed now.

32:06.541 --> 32:07.666
It must be tough, right?

32:07.750 --> 32:08.875
It must be tough.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.291
You guys can do it!

32:10.375 --> 32:11.875
Not that I care.

32:11.958 --> 32:15.000
<i>Karasuno launches</i>
<i>another synchronized attack.</i>

32:15.083 --> 32:16.458
<i>Hinata has sprinted up the middle!</i>

32:16.958 --> 32:19.791
<i>From behind, Azumane suddenly</i>
<i>launched a back-row attack!</i>

32:19.875 --> 32:22.291
<i>But the opponent is still fighting</i>
<i>and refuses to give up.</i>

32:22.375 --> 32:23.958
<i>Nekoma is really persistent.</i>

32:24.041 --> 32:27.291
He makes it sound like
only cats are persistent.

32:27.375 --> 32:29.708
Nekoma is persistent on defense.

32:29.791 --> 32:31.916
Karasuno is persistent on offense.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.458
It's annoying that they attack
synchronously every time.

32:37.041 --> 32:38.208
One is in the sky

32:38.291 --> 32:41.000
and another is on the ground.
Both are equally persistent.

32:41.083 --> 32:44.458
- Does he get it?
- <i>Tendo is so strict with the announcers.</i>

32:45.375 --> 32:50.833
<i>But in order to dominate the air,</i>
<i>the crows have to keep jumping.</i>

32:50.916 --> 32:53.416
<i>It's more tiring in comparison.</i>

32:53.500 --> 32:57.541
<i>I'm sure the cats know that too.</i>

32:59.500 --> 33:00.375
<i>This is it.</i>

33:01.041 --> 33:03.875
<i>It's time to drag the crows to the ground.</i>

33:04.666 --> 33:06.041
Chance ball!

33:08.375 --> 33:09.750
<i>Synchronized attack!</i>

33:10.791 --> 33:11.708
<i>Sometimes,</i>

33:12.291 --> 33:15.666
<i>the path that seems the most tiring</i>
<i>is actually the easiest choice.</i>

33:22.250 --> 33:25.625
- That was so cool!
- Did you see that?

33:27.791 --> 33:29.416
That's why I hate them.

33:29.916 --> 33:31.375
NEKOMA: 6, KARASUNO: 8

33:32.916 --> 33:35.041
What set is it now?

33:35.625 --> 33:38.000
I think it's already the fifth set.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.583
It's the fifth set, right?

33:40.166 --> 33:42.416
It's only the first half
of the second set!

33:42.500 --> 33:44.416
There's plenty of game time!

33:44.500 --> 33:46.291
We still have a long way to go.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.250
Get out of the way! It's so hot!

33:49.333 --> 33:52.375
Dammit, how many times
will they do synchronized attacks?

33:52.458 --> 33:54.208
Who do you think we're up against?

33:54.291 --> 33:55.458
It's Karasuno, after all.

33:55.541 --> 33:56.458
Don't worry.

33:57.125 --> 33:59.041
They're starting to get tired.

33:59.125 --> 34:01.250
Their stamina isn't unlimited.

34:02.041 --> 34:05.291
Well, neither are ours.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.250
Kenma.

34:08.083 --> 34:11.166
Stop. Please don't say that line.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.875
- Let's show them our mettle!
- Get lost!

34:13.958 --> 34:15.791
Looks like they're still energetic.

34:16.541 --> 34:17.833
Tsukishima, nice serve!

34:18.333 --> 34:19.708
Fukunaga, front!

34:22.083 --> 34:22.916
Chance ball!

34:26.666 --> 34:28.583
Go! A slide attack!

34:33.500 --> 34:35.375
All right!

34:35.458 --> 34:36.458
What?

34:37.625 --> 34:39.916
Hinata, you got scared of me, right?

34:40.000 --> 34:42.333
What? I didn't!

34:42.416 --> 34:43.666
Lev.

34:44.166 --> 34:47.458
You did. Just take it easy, you dumbass!

34:48.333 --> 34:49.833
I'll get the next one!

34:49.916 --> 34:51.875
Pass the ball to me, Kageyama!

34:52.375 --> 34:54.000
NEKOMA: 12, KARASUNO: 15

34:56.041 --> 34:57.708
- <i>They aimed for the front again!</i>
- Yes!

34:57.791 --> 34:59.541
<i>But the libero, Nishinoya, bumped it!</i>

34:59.625 --> 35:00.708
Go!

35:00.791 --> 35:02.416
<i>That's a strong straight ball!</i>

35:03.041 --> 35:05.708
- <i>It's up again!</i>
- Sho hasn't been able to score.

35:07.208 --> 35:08.333
<i>Cover!</i>

35:09.791 --> 35:10.708
Nice cover!

35:11.208 --> 35:13.625
<i>Karasuno bumped it,</i>
<i>but their formation is off!</i>

35:13.708 --> 35:17.041
A little off-positioning
won't affect them--

35:31.708 --> 35:34.500
All right!

35:35.083 --> 35:37.958
Nice play, nice play, Haiba!

35:38.041 --> 35:40.833
Do that again!

35:41.750 --> 35:43.416
They're so strong.

35:43.500 --> 35:44.958
They saw through it.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.625
They used a triple block on Hinata.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.583
They're catching up little by little.

35:49.666 --> 35:51.458
NEKOMA: 13, KARASUNO: 15

35:51.541 --> 35:52.375
Lev.

35:53.625 --> 35:59.083
When Karasuno attacks,
if Shoyo can get a good run-up,

35:59.166 --> 36:01.625
all three of us go to block him.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.416
I think it's about time.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.875
How did you know to mark Hinata just now?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.375
Kenma, you're scary.

36:10.458 --> 36:14.208
You can tell that Shoyo's spikes
are minimal today, right?

36:15.291 --> 36:16.125
Yes.

36:16.208 --> 36:19.083
Do you mean when our serves
were aimed at Hinata?

36:19.166 --> 36:21.166
That's not all.

36:22.916 --> 36:27.416
Not only did he let Shoyo receive,
but he also made use of me.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.666
<i>At the beginning of the set,</i>

36:30.750 --> 36:34.666
<i>Shoyo received the serve himself</i>
<i>and followed up with a slide attack.</i>

36:34.750 --> 36:38.458
<i>But when we were</i>
<i>in the same rotation just now,</i>

36:38.541 --> 36:40.583
<i>he forced me to dig the ball</i>
<i>in that position</i>

36:40.666 --> 36:43.458
<i>and blocked Shoyo's run-up to the right.</i>

36:44.250 --> 36:46.458
At first, I thought
it was just a coincidence.

36:47.041 --> 36:49.166
But now, I'm sure it was intentional.

36:50.583 --> 36:53.125
They're totally targeting Hinata.

36:54.958 --> 36:58.291
<i>Shoyo loves to jump, but he can't jump.</i>

36:58.375 --> 37:00.541
<i>I'm sure he's starting to get frustrated.</i>

37:01.750 --> 37:05.416
<i>The overly strong spike that went out</i>
<i>of bounds just now made me more certain.</i>

37:07.000 --> 37:11.416
<i>A setter doesn't want a spiker to dwell</i>
<i>on a mistake for too long.</i>

37:12.333 --> 37:17.458
<i>That's why I figured he'd toss it to Shoyo</i>
<i>if he had the chance.</i>

37:19.416 --> 37:21.083
Kenma is so scary.

37:21.166 --> 37:22.916
- Yes, he is.
- Scary.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.791
It's good to have some success.

37:26.291 --> 37:27.916
I've said this many times.

37:28.000 --> 37:31.000
No attack can be completely shut down.

37:31.500 --> 37:36.125
We just need to reduce the number of shots
that Karasuno can score.

37:36.625 --> 37:39.291
If we keep piling up
small stressors like this,

37:39.375 --> 37:42.041
they might make a mistake.

37:42.541 --> 37:45.708
It's good enough if it causes them
to lose two or three points.

37:47.291 --> 37:49.166
<i>First, his points, then, his path.</i>

37:50.041 --> 37:52.375
<i>I'm going to cut off Shoyo's path.</i>

37:54.666 --> 37:58.250
<i>His approach is his wings.</i>

38:14.625 --> 38:16.166
Kenma.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.708
What? Did you faint from hunger?

38:19.541 --> 38:22.083
The lady just gave me shrimp crackers.
Want some?

38:22.583 --> 38:26.833
Clearing the game
is sadder than game over.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.875
Let's go!

38:33.208 --> 38:35.541
- Let's go!
- Kageyama!

38:40.208 --> 38:42.500
Nice serve! Let's score again!

38:49.500 --> 38:50.375
Left!

38:52.833 --> 38:54.750
All right!

38:55.333 --> 38:56.666
Asahi, nice kill!

38:57.250 --> 38:58.541
Shake it off.

39:01.625 --> 39:04.125
<i>As long as we can get in the way</i>
<i>of the strongest decoy,</i>

39:04.625 --> 39:07.250
<i>our blocks will be a lot easier.</i>

39:08.375 --> 39:10.166
<i>Even if we can't get Shoyo</i>

39:10.250 --> 39:12.500
<i>to receive our serves</i>
<i>or block his space for an approach,</i>

39:13.000 --> 39:15.125
<i>making him hesitate will be enough.</i>

39:15.625 --> 39:16.541
<i>"Should I bump it?</i>

39:17.041 --> 39:19.375
<i>Or should I let someone behind</i>
<i>or beside me do it?"</i>

39:20.125 --> 39:24.500
<i>Shoyo is very conscious</i>
<i>of receiving serves right now.</i>

39:26.500 --> 39:27.333
One-touch!

39:28.166 --> 39:32.750
<i>I've never felt this small</i>
<i>of a presence from Chibi-chan.</i>

39:33.875 --> 39:36.750
<i>Shoyo tries his best at everything,</i>

39:36.833 --> 39:39.416
<i>be it receiving or securing</i>
<i>approach distance.</i>

39:39.500 --> 39:43.083
- Chance ball!
- <i>But hard work doesn't solve everything.</i>

39:43.166 --> 39:45.000
Don't forget about me!

39:50.541 --> 39:52.916
All right!

39:53.000 --> 39:55.625
Nice kill, Haiba!

39:55.708 --> 39:57.583
They used a back-row attack?

39:57.666 --> 39:58.833
It's Lev, after all.

39:59.333 --> 40:02.333
Keep it in mind and switch gears.

40:03.166 --> 40:05.791
<i>All right, one more time.</i>

40:05.875 --> 40:07.208
Out!

40:08.083 --> 40:09.375
Yes!

40:11.083 --> 40:12.166
NEKOMA: 16, KARASUNO: 18

40:12.250 --> 40:13.083
Dammit!

40:13.666 --> 40:16.166
Hinata went to the back row
without getting a single point.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.875
Hinata, nice serve!

40:17.958 --> 40:21.125
Amazing. That took me by surprise.

40:23.166 --> 40:24.583
All right!

40:25.333 --> 40:27.291
<i>You're so fun to play against, Shoyo.</i>

40:27.375 --> 40:29.291
Let's get this point!

40:31.458 --> 40:32.875
Nice receive!

40:33.750 --> 40:35.958
<i>Let's play a game with no second chances!</i>

40:36.041 --> 40:38.416
All right, let's go!

40:39.166 --> 40:41.416
I'm just playing to kill time.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.958
It was just okay, I guess.

40:49.500 --> 40:51.833
<i>Keep being interesting.</i>

41:00.208 --> 41:01.166
Shoyo!

41:01.666 --> 41:04.500
- You're up next.
- Okay!

41:05.333 --> 41:07.208
All right, cheer up!

41:08.458 --> 41:11.833
Wow, this is interesting.

41:12.583 --> 41:18.291
Wouldn't such a lively scene be a waste
if the game ended in the second set?

41:19.000 --> 41:21.125
NEKOMA: 21, KARASUNO: 21

41:22.916 --> 41:24.208
Fukunaga!

41:27.333 --> 41:28.333
- Nice receive!
- <i>All right!</i>

41:31.000 --> 41:32.583
<i>The setter retreated.</i>

41:33.166 --> 41:34.541
<i>All five are attacking?</i>

41:34.625 --> 41:36.250
<i>This way, I can secure</i>
<i>my approach distance.</i>

41:37.250 --> 41:38.500
<i>His high-speed mobility…</i>

41:45.875 --> 41:48.000
<i>Securing approach distance!</i>

41:50.166 --> 41:54.000
<i>…can go toe-to-toe with</i>
<i>a 190 cm blocker's jumping power.</i>

41:54.083 --> 41:55.250
Dammit!

41:59.791 --> 42:02.000
<i>Securing approach distance!</i>

42:02.625 --> 42:05.333
<i>He's useless if he's even one step behind.</i>

42:05.416 --> 42:07.458
<i>His presence will be overshadowed.</i>

42:08.458 --> 42:11.666
<i>It doesn't matter,</i>
<i>even if he uses 99% of his power.</i>

42:13.708 --> 42:14.375
It's over the net!

42:15.125 --> 42:16.833
- Chance ball!
- Got it!

42:16.916 --> 42:18.791
<i>Securing approach distance…</i>

42:22.083 --> 42:25.958
<i>Towards Shoyo</i>
<i>who can't jump to his fullest,</i>

42:26.750 --> 42:29.625
<i>Kageyama won't be interested, will he?</i>

42:36.875 --> 42:40.250
Nice play, nice play, Haiba!

42:40.333 --> 42:43.208
All right!

42:43.291 --> 42:47.375
Why did that happen?
Everyone clearly tried so hard!

42:47.458 --> 42:48.791
That was bad luck.

42:49.666 --> 42:53.083
<i>Why now, of all times?</i>

42:53.583 --> 42:54.916
Are you all right?

42:55.000 --> 42:55.958
I'm fine.

42:56.041 --> 42:57.166
I'm sorry.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.916
<i>It's all going</i>
<i>according to your plan, isn't it?</i>

43:01.708 --> 43:03.750
<i>What's with that face?</i>

43:04.250 --> 43:09.125
<i>You're the one who tore off his wings,</i>
<i>yet you look so sad.</i>

43:10.375 --> 43:13.166
<i>Man, you're a handful.</i>

43:18.500 --> 43:19.625
<i>Will it be risky?</i>

43:20.541 --> 43:22.250
<i>Is it worth trying?</i>

43:23.208 --> 43:25.500
<i>I mean, is Hinata usable right now?</i>

43:30.333 --> 43:33.166
<i>Breaking down the wall</i>
<i>in front of the spiker…</i>

43:34.333 --> 43:36.083
<i>That's what the setter is for.</i>

43:38.291 --> 43:43.875
I can't see your worth
without a setter like Kageyama.

43:43.958 --> 43:45.000
KARASUNO HIGH SCHOOL

43:48.083 --> 43:48.916
Hinata,

43:50.041 --> 43:51.166
nice receive!

43:51.666 --> 43:53.583
Keep it up. I'm leaving the rest to you.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.125
Yes!

43:59.291 --> 44:01.416
What's Number 10's role
on the black shirt team?

44:02.250 --> 44:04.708
He's short, and his attacks
aren't scoring much.

44:04.791 --> 44:06.708
Why did they put him in?

44:06.791 --> 44:09.375
He was pretty active in the first set.

44:11.458 --> 44:15.833
<i>We're doing everything we can to stop</i>
<i>Number 10 from getting his way, okay?</i>

44:16.708 --> 44:18.041
Nice serve!

44:24.500 --> 44:26.958
<i>It hurts, doesn't it, Shoyo?</i>

44:28.041 --> 44:32.416
<i>Kenma wants me to receive the ball,</i>
<i>so that I can't use my skills.</i>

44:33.333 --> 44:37.500
<i>The more you think about it,</i>
<i>the more conflicted you get.</i>

44:38.291 --> 44:42.791
<i>How can I receive the serves</i>
<i>and secure an approach distance?</i>

44:43.958 --> 44:47.791
<i>Finding a shortcut to get rid</i>
<i>of your anxiety and frustration…</i>

44:49.125 --> 44:52.125
<i>What should I do?</i>
<i>Is there a way to do that?</i>

44:54.750 --> 44:56.750
<i>Keep getting conflicted about it.</i>

44:58.416 --> 45:00.208
Nice serve!

45:01.125 --> 45:02.500
Front!

45:07.500 --> 45:10.666
<i>Receiving threw me into a cage.</i>

45:12.666 --> 45:14.208
<i>Game over.</i>

45:16.333 --> 45:17.750
<i>I guess this is it.</i>

45:23.375 --> 45:24.916
<i>But even so,</i>

45:25.500 --> 45:27.750
<i>I can't abandon either one of them.</i>

45:28.750 --> 45:31.458
<i>If nobody digs the ball, we can't spike.</i>

45:31.541 --> 45:34.166
<i>Once the ball hits the floor,</i>
<i>there'll be no more volleyball!</i>

45:34.833 --> 45:38.416
<i>There's no shortcut to scoring!</i>

45:43.541 --> 45:44.708
Kageyama.

45:46.208 --> 45:47.583
Be bold out there.

45:49.875 --> 45:52.500
Okay. Thank you, Coach.

45:53.500 --> 45:55.500
<i>I have to pave the way for my spiker!</i>

45:56.500 --> 45:57.416
Four set!

46:00.958 --> 46:01.791
<i>There!</i>

46:03.125 --> 46:03.958
<i>Fly!</i>

46:07.000 --> 46:08.875
<i>A four set over the center?</i>

46:19.291 --> 46:20.791
<i>The approach distance is good!</i>

46:21.500 --> 46:23.916
<i>He purposely set the ball</i>
<i>high in the center.</i>

46:24.916 --> 46:25.833
<i>We have three blockers.</i>

46:25.916 --> 46:29.291
<i>It's different from a quick attack</i>
<i>coordinated with the setter.</i>

46:29.375 --> 46:31.791
<i>A lot of people aren't good</i>
<i>at spiking high sets.</i>

46:31.875 --> 46:34.541
<i>Besides, Shoyo has always</i>
<i>been good at superfast attacks.</i>

46:34.625 --> 46:37.458
<i>I don't think he can get used to it.</i>

46:38.750 --> 46:41.166
I think you can jump higher.

46:41.250 --> 46:44.375
The kind of jump I'm talking about
makes a sound

46:44.458 --> 46:46.041
like you're kicking off the ground.

47:08.125 --> 47:09.583
All right!

47:09.666 --> 47:11.000
FLY

47:11.083 --> 47:15.000
Nice kill, Shoyo! Do that again!

47:15.916 --> 47:18.875
<i>That was an intentional four set.</i>

47:18.958 --> 47:21.041
<i>Shoyo's weapon is speed, though.</i>

47:21.125 --> 47:23.458
- <i>Even if it was a high set,</i>
- Your jump was higher than usual.

47:23.541 --> 47:26.666
- <i>he could still hit that?</i>
- I'm learning to jump with a bang!

47:27.875 --> 47:30.500
Did he just jump super high?

47:32.333 --> 47:33.500
He flew up.

47:36.125 --> 47:38.083
Your jump wasn't half bad.

47:39.625 --> 47:42.750
Your toss just now was awesome!

47:44.291 --> 47:45.458
I'm complimenting you!

47:47.500 --> 47:48.416
IT WENT OVER OUR BLOCK

47:48.500 --> 47:49.416
RIGHT, HIS HANG TIME IS DIFFERENT

47:49.500 --> 47:50.416
SHOYO COULD EVEN HIT A FOUR SET ACCURATELY

47:50.500 --> 47:51.541
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM OUR USUAL
"JUST CAUGHT UP TO HIM" BLOCKS

47:51.625 --> 47:52.875
<i>Right.</i>

47:53.583 --> 47:55.875
<i>Magic attacks and projectile attacks…</i>

47:55.958 --> 47:58.125
<i>If they get sealed off</i>
<i>and can't be effective,</i>

47:58.208 --> 48:01.833
<i>we can just use physical attacks.</i>

48:04.458 --> 48:06.916
<i>I guess I don't need to say anything.</i>

48:07.708 --> 48:09.250
Kageyama, nice serve!

48:12.291 --> 48:13.458
Out!

48:16.250 --> 48:17.416
That was close.

48:20.916 --> 48:22.333
It's Inuoka!

48:24.333 --> 48:26.333
It's that agile Number 7!

48:26.416 --> 48:28.708
They're strengthening
their defense right away.

48:30.250 --> 48:33.333
<i>Both shields are fully equipped.</i>

48:34.208 --> 48:36.166
I'll do my best!

48:38.958 --> 48:41.416
Their original defense
is already a headache.

48:41.500 --> 48:44.208
Now, they made their front row
even taller.

48:44.291 --> 48:46.583
How is that legal?

48:47.750 --> 48:52.166
If they give Shoyo another four set,
we need to delay the timing of our block.

48:52.250 --> 48:53.375
Yes!

48:53.458 --> 48:56.625
Because Shoyo's hang time
is longer than ours.

48:56.708 --> 48:57.625
Yes!

49:01.250 --> 49:01.791
- Daichi!
- Captain!

49:01.875 --> 49:02.916
Got it!

49:04.333 --> 49:05.583
- Nice receive!
- <i>They figured it out.</i>

49:12.250 --> 49:13.875
All right!

49:15.291 --> 49:17.250
Center again!

49:18.208 --> 49:19.416
<i>Again?</i>

49:21.666 --> 49:23.375
<i>We need to delay our timing.</i>

49:23.458 --> 49:24.916
<i>Ready, go!</i>

49:28.833 --> 49:30.250
Back!

49:31.041 --> 49:33.208
All right!

49:33.916 --> 49:36.416
Hinata was aiming
for the fingertips, right?

49:36.500 --> 49:37.500
Yes.

49:37.583 --> 49:40.166
He's the type you hate the most
as a blocker!

49:42.208 --> 49:44.625
<i>What's going to happen next?</i>

49:45.250 --> 49:47.208
All right, just one more point!

49:47.291 --> 49:48.583
NEKOMA: 24, KARASUNO: 25

49:48.666 --> 49:50.625
Hinata, nice serve!

49:50.708 --> 49:51.625
Front!

49:52.125 --> 49:53.750
<i>Is Kuroo going to move up?</i>

49:53.833 --> 49:54.958
<i>No!</i>

49:58.916 --> 49:59.791
One-touch!

49:59.875 --> 50:01.541
Chance ball!

50:02.125 --> 50:04.958
<i>Synchronized attack, all!</i>

50:07.750 --> 50:08.625
One-touch!

50:08.708 --> 50:10.333
Chance ball!

50:10.416 --> 50:12.041
<i>Synchronized attack!</i>

50:23.458 --> 50:24.291
<i>I knew it.</i>

50:25.166 --> 50:27.916
<i>Shoyo keeps getting new updates</i>
<i>as the battle goes on.</i>

50:28.000 --> 50:29.166
Back!

50:33.458 --> 50:35.583
Nice shot, Shoyo!

50:35.666 --> 50:38.041
NEKOMA: 24, KARASUNO: 26

50:38.625 --> 50:41.750
Dammit, my straight was perfect.

50:41.833 --> 50:43.750
That was a good one.

50:43.833 --> 50:46.333
What's with your Number 10?

50:46.416 --> 50:47.750
I don't know what you want.

50:49.500 --> 50:52.416
Akane, we still have a final set!

50:52.916 --> 50:55.416
I know, but it's frustrating.

50:55.500 --> 50:59.166
I know it doesn't make sense,
but it's so frustrating!

50:59.666 --> 51:02.375
I can't believe
they scored with a receive.

51:02.458 --> 51:04.791
It's one set to one set now.

51:05.291 --> 51:08.833
But actually, the team that won
the second set has the advantage.

51:09.333 --> 51:12.333
On top of that,
their Number 10 came back to life.

51:13.250 --> 51:15.750
<i>I didn't think Kageyama</i>
<i>would be interested in Shoyo</i>

51:15.833 --> 51:18.541
<i>without his fullest jump.</i>

51:19.125 --> 51:23.166
<i>But he managed to make</i>
<i>Shoyo jump to his fullest.</i>

51:26.458 --> 51:28.625
They're a pair of devils.

51:29.833 --> 51:32.791
Don't get cocky
just because it happened once.

51:32.875 --> 51:34.583
Why can't you praise me once in a while?

51:34.666 --> 51:37.375
You were self-conflicted just now,
weren't you?

51:37.458 --> 51:39.333
Let's crush them with sheer momentum!

51:39.916 --> 51:42.208
I'll make sure I score 20 points.

51:42.291 --> 51:44.708
I'll leave the remaining five points
to you guys.

51:44.791 --> 51:46.125
Did you know?

51:47.041 --> 51:51.208
When you're working out,
instead of doing 100 normal sit-ups,

51:51.791 --> 51:56.250
it's better to do ten sit-ups
with extra weight.

51:59.750 --> 52:01.166
What are you talking about?

52:02.375 --> 52:05.583
Isn't it better to do more?

52:05.666 --> 52:06.833
In other words…

52:06.916 --> 52:08.958
Instead of scoring 20 normal points,
it's better

52:09.041 --> 52:10.541
to score that weighted one point!

52:10.625 --> 52:11.708
Nod.

52:11.791 --> 52:13.166
Why are you nodding?

52:13.250 --> 52:16.291
What's a weighted one point?
You'd better get those 20 points!

52:19.208 --> 52:20.041
Did you hear?

52:20.125 --> 52:23.958
Keep your head up!

52:24.041 --> 52:27.416
That straight ball just now was amazing!

52:28.291 --> 52:30.791
- When did you practice that?
- Thank you!

52:31.291 --> 52:32.500
That's Kuroo for you.

52:33.750 --> 52:36.750
Be careful of Chibi-chan's
spike timing of high sets.

52:36.833 --> 52:38.416
What you did just now was good.

52:38.500 --> 52:40.958
- I already said that.
- I see!

52:42.833 --> 52:44.000
What's wrong?

52:44.083 --> 52:45.875
I was just thinking
that you sure talk a lot.

52:45.958 --> 52:47.583
What a sudden punch.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.625
<i>Kuroo is good at motivating people.</i>

52:53.791 --> 52:55.333
<i>He's always been like that.</i>

52:59.750 --> 53:02.375
That was unfortunate.
Extend your arms like this.

53:02.458 --> 53:05.416
If you hit it here, the ball will fly.

53:05.500 --> 53:07.833
Why don't you find someone
who can play volleyball?

53:07.916 --> 53:10.083
It's boring to play
with an amateur, right?

53:10.166 --> 53:14.250
It's not boring at all!
You're a fast learner. You're smart.

53:14.750 --> 53:15.791
Really?

53:16.833 --> 53:19.958
<i>Kuroo, who moved in next door, invited me.</i>

53:20.041 --> 53:21.833
<i>That's how I got into volleyball.</i>

53:23.083 --> 53:26.125
<i>Back then, I got carried away by</i>
<i>his compliments and got dragged into it.</i>

53:28.041 --> 53:29.708
Are you free this Saturday?

53:39.875 --> 53:42.750
Are you here to watch?
Do you want to join in?

53:44.666 --> 53:45.500
Here.

53:46.625 --> 53:47.875
Darn it.

53:48.375 --> 53:49.416
Here it comes.

53:50.875 --> 53:52.041
You're good.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.583
That one looks cooler.

53:57.666 --> 53:59.000
Can you do that?

54:00.625 --> 54:03.458
That's called a spike. Isn't it cool?

54:04.583 --> 54:08.083
But I can't go high enough for a spike.

54:08.166 --> 54:10.166
Then, just lower the net.

54:11.125 --> 54:14.625
When you're starting out, the important
thing is the joy of achieving something.

54:15.666 --> 54:18.791
What one likes, one will do well, right?

54:41.291 --> 54:43.333
I spiked it!

54:43.416 --> 54:45.250
<i>It's such a small matter.</i>

54:45.750 --> 54:51.333
<i>I can't help but think that Kuroo</i>
<i>will never forget this day.</i>

54:58.333 --> 55:00.833
Kenma, let's play volleyball!

55:01.416 --> 55:02.750
Kenma, let's play volleyball!

55:03.333 --> 55:04.958
Kenma! Kenma!

55:12.208 --> 55:13.833
BRAZIL VERSUS AMERICA

55:16.708 --> 55:17.791
Darn it!

55:20.375 --> 55:21.416
Yes!

55:26.583 --> 55:29.083
He shot a glance just now.
Did you see that?

55:29.166 --> 55:30.666
He glanced to the right.

55:30.750 --> 55:34.500
I thought he was going to toss it there,
but he tossed it to the left.

55:35.208 --> 55:37.625
It stopped raining,
and I've watched enough.

55:37.708 --> 55:39.333
Let's go play outside.

55:39.416 --> 55:41.333
You're the one who brought it here, Kuroo.

55:41.958 --> 55:44.250
The one we watched last week,
bring it here again.

55:46.708 --> 55:49.625
Kenma, you really should be a setter.

55:49.708 --> 55:52.208
Just like a strategist,
you're going to be so cool.

55:52.291 --> 55:53.375
STRATEGIST

55:53.458 --> 55:54.791
A strategist?

55:54.875 --> 55:57.625
Besides, the setter
doesn't have to move much.

55:57.708 --> 55:59.958
It's a popular position.

56:00.875 --> 56:02.458
Say yes, will you?

56:02.541 --> 56:03.708
<i>What a big liar.</i>

56:06.458 --> 56:09.041
Hurry up.
The park is going to get occupied!

56:09.541 --> 56:10.375
Tetsu.

56:12.333 --> 56:16.750
Could you take Kenma out for soccer
once in a while?

56:19.458 --> 56:21.916
But I don't think Kenma wants to go.

56:22.416 --> 56:25.208
I understand the feeling
of not wanting to go.

56:25.291 --> 56:28.666
Even if he's a little interested,
I would definitely take him there.

56:28.750 --> 56:30.166
But he's not.

56:30.250 --> 56:33.916
But if Kenma likes something,
he will give it his best shot.

56:34.000 --> 56:35.250
So, don't worry.

56:36.166 --> 56:37.125
I see.

56:42.416 --> 56:45.666
If Kuroo could only hype things up,
I wouldn't have hung out with you.

56:47.333 --> 56:49.791
Why do you keep criticizing me?

56:50.666 --> 56:54.250
<i>If I had a choice, I wouldn't sweat.</i>

56:54.750 --> 56:57.333
<i>Sometimes, I just want to play video games</i>
<i>instead of training.</i>

56:57.833 --> 57:01.083
<i>I'd rather watch games</i>
<i>than get on the court.</i>

57:01.583 --> 57:02.583
<i>But…</i>

57:07.250 --> 57:10.916
The thought of "it's time for me to play"

57:11.416 --> 57:12.416
is not something I hate.

57:16.416 --> 57:19.375
- Everyone does whatever they want.
- Call me Straight Ball Taketora!

57:19.458 --> 57:21.083
- Still good?
- One more time!

57:21.166 --> 57:22.916
Go, go, Nekoma!

57:23.000 --> 57:24.500
Push it, push it, Nekoma!

57:25.625 --> 57:27.708
We've made it through the tough times.

57:28.458 --> 57:30.166
Now, it's time for our reward.

57:36.125 --> 57:38.416
I don't know what's going on,
but let's do it too!

57:41.250 --> 57:43.166
<i>This reward…</i>

57:43.958 --> 57:45.666
<i>Which team does it belong to?</i>

57:46.833 --> 57:48.416
<i>This is the final showdown!</i>

57:57.833 --> 57:58.958
KARASUNO HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' VOLLEYBALL CLUB

58:03.958 --> 58:05.500
Left!

58:08.416 --> 58:09.833
That was so cool!

58:09.916 --> 58:11.416
You got a problem with that?

58:11.500 --> 58:14.541
Bring it on! You think
you're some kind of big shot?

58:17.166 --> 58:19.000
All right!

58:19.833 --> 58:21.833
That's because I'm Nekoma's ace.

58:21.916 --> 58:23.041
Front!

58:23.625 --> 58:25.000
Nice receive!

58:25.083 --> 58:26.208
Four set!

58:28.333 --> 58:29.541
Center!

58:31.833 --> 58:33.750
Ready, go!

58:36.500 --> 58:38.625
Then I'll jump to the top before you do.

58:45.666 --> 58:47.291
All right!

58:47.875 --> 58:49.625
They figured a counter way too fast.

58:49.708 --> 58:52.541
Dammit… He's so cool!

58:57.208 --> 58:59.375
Number 3, your receives are truly amazing!

59:01.125 --> 59:02.750
Nice receive!

59:06.250 --> 59:07.708
All right!

59:08.583 --> 59:11.708
<i>I've been scared of you ever since,</i>

59:12.291 --> 59:13.250
Yu!

59:20.666 --> 59:22.541
Will you come block for us?

59:23.458 --> 59:24.916
I'm about to take a break.

59:25.666 --> 59:28.083
Let's train some spikes again today.

59:28.166 --> 59:30.625
Sorry, but I'll pass.

59:33.041 --> 59:35.208
When you block,
avoid forcefully jumping on an angle.

59:35.291 --> 59:37.333
If you have time,
stop and plant your feet.

59:38.958 --> 59:39.875
Jump straight up.

59:42.458 --> 59:44.583
Nice block! Chance ball!

59:45.708 --> 59:46.541
One-touch!

59:46.625 --> 59:49.250
Nice block! Chance ball!

59:54.708 --> 59:55.666
Sorry!

01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:03.958
I just don't get it.

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:06.416
How can you guys practice so hard?

01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:11.083
Tsukki, quit trying so hard.

01:00:11.583 --> 01:00:13.041
You keep going on like this.

01:00:13.666 --> 01:00:15.208
Aren't you tired?

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:21.125
If you could stop trying,
it would be over in no time!

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:25.708
Tsukki is also the type to lose his mind
when he's exhausted.

01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:29.958
Half of that is your fault and Bokuto's.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:34.125
Thank you so much.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.208
Same to you.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.166
They say if you swallow a watermelon seed,

01:00:41.250 --> 01:00:43.500
it'll sprout in your stomach.

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:46.416
- If you ignore it, it'll expand…
- I see. I'll be careful.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.250
Did you know that Bokuto…

01:00:49.333 --> 01:00:51.416
No, but I don't want to know.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.958
- I'm Bokuto.
- I'm Kuroo.

01:00:54.833 --> 01:00:56.541
Hey, hey!

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:02.000
Focus all your strength
on your fingertips.

01:01:02.083 --> 01:01:04.416
- Don't let the ball get past you.
- In a one-on-one with a spiker,

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:07.250
you don't have to block directly
with your body.

01:01:07.333 --> 01:01:09.083
- Just use your dominant hand.
- <i>Listen up, kid.</i>

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:13.583
Read blocking requires
patience and tenacity.

01:01:13.666 --> 01:01:15.833
<i>It's a block</i>
<i>that gives you the last laugh.</i>

01:01:17.833 --> 01:01:19.041
All right!

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:21.000
NEKOMA: 6, KARASUNO: 6

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:22.166
Shake it off!

01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:27.833
Tsukki, your persistent blocking
is giving everyone a headache.

01:01:28.541 --> 01:01:34.625
But this makes me feel so good,
that I know I've made the right choice.

01:01:41.958 --> 01:01:42.833
Follow up!

01:01:42.916 --> 01:01:44.416
Left!

01:01:53.666 --> 01:01:55.500
<i>Dammit, I can't beat him.</i>

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.166
Center!

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:02.166
<i>I can only fight him in front of the net.</i>

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:04.375
Chance ball!

01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:07.333
<i>He's so scary.</i>

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:10.208
<i>Because it's scary…</i>

01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:12.958
<i>Leave no room for hesitation.</i>

01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:15.541
<i>Take the shortest distance,</i>
<i>right in the middle.</i>

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:16.958
<i>It's a battle of heights.</i>

01:02:18.416 --> 01:02:20.541
How's volleyball been for you lately?

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:32.625
NEKOMA: 6, KARASUNO: 7

01:02:37.166 --> 01:02:38.250
Kenma!

01:02:39.625 --> 01:02:40.958
Shoyo.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:43.083
When we met on the street back then,

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:46.125
you said you didn't really fancy
playing volleyball, right?

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:50.750
Kageyama, one more nice serve!

01:02:56.958 --> 01:02:58.791
Chance ball!

01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:07.416
Cover!

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.125
Nice cover!

01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:29.458
<i>I feel that you two have a weird vibe.</i>

01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:33.041
Are you two rivals?

01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:35.458
No, we're not.

01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:40.083
<i>We're just friends.</i>

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:48.750
When it's our turn to serve,
switch with Lev.

01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:50.333
Are you up for it, Tamahiko?

01:03:50.916 --> 01:03:53.541
No, I'm not ready yet.

01:03:54.458 --> 01:03:55.666
Maybe you're not.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.791
I like your honesty.

01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:04.166
The courage to say it out calmly
is your weapon.

01:04:07.375 --> 01:04:10.000
- Go!
- Tamahiko, nice serve!

01:04:10.083 --> 01:04:14.000
<i>Letting a setter like me</i>
<i>to pinch serve at this time</i>

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.541
<i>means letting Kozume play until the end.</i>

01:04:18.541 --> 01:04:21.541
<i>Normally, he'd be exhausted by now.</i>

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:25.958
NEKOMA: 17, KARASUNO: 18

01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:27.291
Nice serve!

01:04:34.125 --> 01:04:35.583
- Got it!
- Thanks!

01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:37.750
- Sorry!
- Azumane!

01:04:37.833 --> 01:04:39.541
Ready, jump!

01:04:44.291 --> 01:04:45.125
Oh, no.

01:04:47.416 --> 01:04:49.500
<i>It's going over the net.</i>
<i>They'll spike it. What do I do?</i>

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:52.416
<i>Bait a reach over foul?</i>
<i>Go for a rebound? Send it over?</i>

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:18.166
Bring it on!

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:29.541
<i>Feint?</i>

01:05:32.250 --> 01:05:33.375
<i>They read it!</i>

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:34.833
<i>I can get it!</i>

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:04.833
<i>How do you feel about winning today?</i>

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:09.291
I'm going to make you
use all your strength next time.

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:12.125
I'm going to make you say
"frustrated" or "interesting",

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:14.250
other than, "It was just okay."

01:06:15.916 --> 01:06:18.958
Kenma, are you okay? Are you hurt?

01:06:25.208 --> 01:06:28.125
I'm so happy.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.375
NEKOMA: 17, KARASUNO: 20

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:07.958
FLY

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:10.500
CONNECT

01:07:15.666 --> 01:07:19.416
Healing my low-HP characters
so that they can continue fighting.

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.375
Resurrecting dead characters
so that they can go back to battle.

01:07:24.875 --> 01:07:30.875
From now on, I'll have more sympathy
for my characters when they are in battle.

01:07:30.958 --> 01:07:33.500
<i>But he let his characters get to low HP.</i>

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:34.708
Don't worry.

01:07:36.291 --> 01:07:39.208
Volleyball rarely kills.

01:07:40.875 --> 01:07:44.750
FLY - CONNECT

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:47.666
Got it!

01:07:48.666 --> 01:07:50.791
<i>Synchronized attack, all!</i>

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:53.833
One-touch!

01:07:54.958 --> 01:07:59.458
<i>Right now, I think I roughly know</i>
<i>what Shoyo is thinking.</i>

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:04.541
<i>When I control my dying characters</i>
<i>while fighting the last boss,</i>

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:07.000
<i>I often have</i>
<i>the same contradictory thought,</i>

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.125
<i>"Please don't die yet."</i>

01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:11.583
Left!

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.750
Kenma!

01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:20.041
<i>Not yet.</i>

01:08:21.041 --> 01:08:22.041
<i>Not yet.</i>

01:08:26.833 --> 01:08:27.750
Nice receive!

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:31.250
All right!

01:08:57.208 --> 01:09:02.083
NEKOMA

01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.750
Kageyama, nice serve!

01:09:31.666 --> 01:09:33.375
Taketora!

01:09:37.166 --> 01:09:38.333
Kenma!

01:09:38.416 --> 01:09:41.708
Idiot! Focus on the ball!
It hasn't hit the floor yet!

01:09:54.041 --> 01:09:57.291
<i>It's so painful and tiring.</i>

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:03.000
Last ball!

01:10:06.625 --> 01:10:08.458
<i>But I don't want it to end.</i>

01:10:09.041 --> 01:10:10.000
Get it!

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:13.166
<i>Sweat…</i>

01:11:23.666 --> 01:11:28.208
The ball slipped away because of sweat.

01:11:28.291 --> 01:11:30.041
I can't believe it ended like this.

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:31.541
In that intense rally,

01:11:31.625 --> 01:11:35.958
the ball was covered in the sweat
of every player who touched it.

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:40.250
That was amazing.

01:11:43.291 --> 01:11:44.958
Tanaka, nice serve!

01:11:45.458 --> 01:11:46.666
What?

01:11:49.958 --> 01:11:53.125
NEKOMA: 21, KARASUNO: 25

01:11:53.208 --> 01:11:54.625
It's over, you moron.

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:26.375
<i>Whether we win</i>

01:12:26.875 --> 01:12:28.333
<i>or lose,</i>

01:12:29.333 --> 01:12:32.666
<i>no one will die or come back to life.</i>

01:12:33.250 --> 01:12:37.125
<i>Without the meddling of an evil force,</i>
<i>the world won't end.</i>

01:12:38.291 --> 01:12:41.208
<i>Instead of exploring a vast world,</i>

01:12:41.708 --> 01:12:45.833
<i>we stay in this 9 x 18 m area,</i>

01:12:46.333 --> 01:12:49.666
<i>just to desperately keep the ball</i>
<i>from hitting the floor.</i>

01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:55.708
I had so much fun.

01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:01.500
Kuroo.

01:13:02.291 --> 01:13:06.333
Thank you for teaching me
how to play volleyball.

01:13:23.250 --> 01:13:25.583
Hey, wait up, you idiot!

01:13:26.083 --> 01:13:27.500
Why are you mad?

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.083
Line up!

01:13:39.083 --> 01:13:41.666
I swear I'm getting a fever
when I get home today.

01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:44.833
I want to be on the court too.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:46.416
But you did.

01:13:46.916 --> 01:13:48.333
I mean, for real.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.625
I want to play volleyball like that too.

01:13:55.125 --> 01:13:57.250
Thank you for the game!

01:14:03.958 --> 01:14:06.708
How did you dodge the block
so beautifully?

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:08.500
Yes! Wait, did I?

01:14:08.583 --> 01:14:09.916
Make up your mind.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:25.500
SHIRATORIZAWA ACADEMY

01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:29.125
Tsutomu, if you were up against cats,
you'd probably be hitting home runs.

01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:30.583
That's not true.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:35.083
That Yo-kai Chibi knows
how to use four sets now.

01:14:35.166 --> 01:14:36.416
I won't lose to him!

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:51.541
- Thank you, Tsukki.
- You were so awesome!

01:15:23.333 --> 01:15:25.208
Thank you!

01:15:25.833 --> 01:15:28.166
Thank you!

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:34.458
TOKYO, NEKOMA

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:39.416
We'll save the self-reflection for later.

01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:43.625
It was a good game. Thank you.

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:52.291
Thank you very much!

01:15:52.375 --> 01:15:54.541
Thank you very much!

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:05.291
NEKOMA - 1
KARASUNO - 2

01:16:05.375 --> 01:16:09.083
It's over. I still can't believe it.

01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:10.291
It's over,

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:14.541
but for these past three years,
I'm glad I could play with Kuroo and Yaku.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.750
You've got to be kidding me, Kai!
Stop saying stuff like that!

01:16:20.833 --> 01:16:23.625
What's with everyone?

01:16:28.333 --> 01:16:31.500
Guys, lower me down a little.
I'm floating in the air.

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:34.833
You made it look like I hurt my leg again!

01:16:35.333 --> 01:16:36.250
Kenma!

01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.166
- Let's…
- Let's play again next time.

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:45.666
I was just about to say that!

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:47.125
What? Like I care!

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:51.125
Kenma, let's play again next year.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.916
Let's.

01:17:02.458 --> 01:17:04.208
Kenma, we're leaving.

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:05.958
Okay.

01:17:06.750 --> 01:17:09.083
See you, Shoyo.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.375
Yes, see you!

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:20.541

SHUEISHA WEEKLY JUMP COMICS

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:11.333
The game at Court A
looks like it'll be over soon.

01:21:11.416 --> 01:21:12.416
Yes.

01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:15.041
Itachiyama is a front-runner
in this tournament, after all.

VENUE GUIDE MAP

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:21.041
Wow, he's even taller up close.

01:21:21.125 --> 01:21:24.083
That guy used his rooster head
to lie about his height.

01:21:24.166 --> 01:21:25.458
I can hear you.

01:21:26.291 --> 01:21:28.416
Sorry, can you let us talk for a bit?

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.916
Sure, I'll go look at souvenirs.

01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:32.916
Thank you.

01:21:38.541 --> 01:21:39.375
LOSERS

01:21:39.458 --> 01:21:42.833
Welcome to this side!

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:49.000
Someone take a picture of his face!
I want to show it to Mika!

01:21:49.083 --> 01:21:51.500
There's no need to be discouraged.

01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:55.750
Except for one team,
everyone's bound to lose.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:58.958
The only difference is the timing.
It's not a big deal.

01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:03.166
You don't actually believe
you can win the tournament, do you?

01:22:06.166 --> 01:22:10.708
Indeed, only a handful of people
in this world believe

01:22:10.791 --> 01:22:12.666
they can win with absolute certainty.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:15.166
What the heck? Why aren't you angry?

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:16.625
I provoked you for nothing.

01:22:19.458 --> 01:22:23.833
Whether you believe you can win or not
doesn't matter at all.

01:22:24.375 --> 01:22:27.125
It's not like you'll quit playing
because of a loss.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.791
We don't play solely
because we want to win.

01:22:29.458 --> 01:22:31.000
Got that, you punks?

01:22:31.083 --> 01:22:33.750
Watch what you say, Daisho.
I'm recording you.

01:22:33.833 --> 01:22:36.708
Why did you come to pick a fight
and get angry yourself?

01:22:37.291 --> 01:22:40.541
- Shut up! You idiots!
- Are you done talking?

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:44.500
Yes. When did you get back?

01:22:44.583 --> 01:22:46.375
What do you want for lunch?

01:22:47.083 --> 01:22:48.291
I feel like having omelet rice.

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:50.708
- That sounds nice.
- What's wrong with him?

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:52.041
He's an interesting guy.

01:22:53.833 --> 01:22:57.500
There seems to be
a lot of good food around here.

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:08.791
"Indeed, only a handful of people
in this world believe

01:23:08.875 --> 01:23:10.333
they can win with absolute certainty."

01:23:11.416 --> 01:23:13.791
They might not believe per se,

01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:18.166
but some are completely
dead set on winning.

CONGRATS, KARASUNO HIGH SCHOOL

01:23:35.041 --> 01:23:37.416
KARASUNO HIGH SCHOOL

KAMOMEDAI: 25, TAKAGIYAMA: 22

01:23:41.458 --> 01:23:45.333
<i>Our opponent in the quarterfinals</i>
<i>is Kamomedai High School.</i>

01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:47.833
<i>The quarterfinals…</i>

01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:51.375
Did you notice me because I'm short?

01:23:52.375 --> 01:23:56.375
Being short
is disadvantageous for volleyball,

01:23:56.875 --> 01:23:59.375
but never the main reason
for playing badly!

01:24:01.875 --> 01:24:03.916
I watched your Round 2
and Round 3 matches.

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:05.833
You played well.

01:24:08.083 --> 01:24:11.041
Who will be the present-day Little Giant?

01:24:14.333 --> 01:24:15.708
Let's find out.
