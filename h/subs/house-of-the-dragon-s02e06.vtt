rise the hotter.

31:05.448 --> 31:07.826
He cannot destroy
his own city.

31:07.867 --> 31:08.952
Neither can they
overthrow him.

31:08.993 --> 31:12.330
Maybe not,
but it is harder
to wage war abroad

31:12.455 --> 31:15.500
when you must also
keep peace at home.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.337
Then let us see
to our plan.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.344
If I may,
Your Grace...

31:27.679 --> 31:30.348
this becomes you.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.855
(pensive music playing)

31:38.732 --> 31:40.692
(street chatter)

31:40.817 --> 31:42.819
(dog barking)

31:47.323 --> 31:49.576
-That's the last one.
-Thank you.

31:49.701 --> 31:53.371
-What? They haven't
run out, have they?
-Nothing.

31:53.413 --> 31:54.914
There ain't
nothing left.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.835
I've been waiting all day.
I'll take anything. Scraps?

31:59.753 --> 32:01.713
(horse neighs)

32:01.838 --> 32:03.548
(sheep bleating)

32:03.673 --> 32:08.094
(light, tense music playing)

32:08.219 --> 32:11.598
Got enough sheep
for your dragons then,
but none for us.

32:11.681 --> 32:14.851
Where's our meat?
We want meat!

32:14.893 --> 32:16.895
(smallfolk shouting)

32:19.022 --> 32:20.690
Jasper "Ironrod" Wylde:
It seems, Your Grace,

32:20.732 --> 32:23.568
that the smallfolk
have become restless.

32:23.610 --> 32:24.736
Aemond:
So?

32:24.861 --> 32:27.447
Ironrod: There is not
food enough in the city.

32:27.572 --> 32:30.200
Those with means
have bought more
than their share.

32:30.241 --> 32:33.203
All the more reason
Ser Tyland must break
the blockade.

32:33.244 --> 32:35.872
In the meantime,
the people are hungry,

32:35.914 --> 32:38.792
and their anger
is rising.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.710
The enemy without
may be fought with swords.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.213
The enemy within
is more insidious.

32:43.254 --> 32:45.215
Why is this anger
directed at us?

32:45.757 --> 32:46.966
It is Rhaenyra
the Pretender

32:47.092 --> 32:48.134
who ordered
the Gullet closed

32:48.259 --> 32:49.761
and left them
all to starve.

32:49.886 --> 32:52.097
They still look
to you to ensure
their well-being.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.308
That is the burden
of authority.

32:56.267 --> 32:59.562
But you should not
go it alone.

32:59.604 --> 33:03.066
It does occur to me
that Your Grace has yet
to name a Hand.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.568
Ser Criston, of course,
served your brother,

33:05.610 --> 33:08.613
but you need one
who may advance
your cause...

33:09.114 --> 33:10.615
with shrewdness
and subtlety.

33:12.450 --> 33:14.452
Do you take me
for a fool?

33:17.747 --> 33:19.624
-On the contrary, my prince.
-Aemond: I've little patience

33:19.666 --> 33:21.626
for the self-important,
Lord Larys,

33:21.751 --> 33:24.629
and even less
for flatterers
and lickspittles.

33:25.672 --> 33:28.258
But you are,
as it happens, correct.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.010
Every king
needs a Hand.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.471
I'll make it
your responsibility.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.101
(clears throat)
My prince, it is an honor
I'd never considered

33:38.143 --> 33:41.438
-for myself.
-No, not to serve
as Hand, you toad.

33:41.479 --> 33:44.524
To fetch him.
Send word
to Otto Hightower.

33:44.649 --> 33:46.109
My grandsire may
be overcautious,

33:46.151 --> 33:49.779
but his devotion
to his family has
never been in doubt.

33:50.989 --> 33:52.490
Mm, you'll
see it done.

33:52.615 --> 33:54.200
(whispers)
Your Grace.

33:54.325 --> 33:56.286
-(door closes)
-You're late.

33:56.327 --> 33:59.622
I am happy to report
that His Grace the king

33:59.664 --> 34:02.125
has regained
consciousness
this morning,

34:02.167 --> 34:03.626
if only
for a few moments.

34:03.668 --> 34:05.670
Ironrod:
You said there was
little hope.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.797
Grand Maester Orwyle:
He is stronger than I thought.

34:07.839 --> 34:10.300
This morning
his breath
comes easier.

34:10.342 --> 34:13.136
He may yet live,
thank the gods.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.513
What happy news.

34:19.309 --> 34:21.518

34:33.364 --> 34:34.699
Aemond:
I'll see my brother.

34:35.909 --> 34:37.077
Alone.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.163
(Aegon groaning)

34:59.432 --> 35:01.059
What do you
remember?

35:06.439 --> 35:07.941
(hoarsely)
Nothing.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.240
(grunting)

35:21.705 --> 35:23.915
You challenged
Meleys.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.585
It was foolish.

35:30.422 --> 35:33.717
I remember... nothing.

35:38.930 --> 35:40.598
(groaning)

35:42.434 --> 35:44.227
(door opens)

35:47.147 --> 35:51.609
-My prince?
-You're in the most
capable hands, Your Grace.

35:58.992 --> 36:02.954
It seems my brother has
a long recovery ahead of him,
Grand Maester.

36:05.123 --> 36:08.126
See that he is made
to rest comfortably.

36:13.131 --> 36:15.675
Rhaena Targaryen:
And I've decided
there is nothing

36:15.800 --> 36:17.510
to be gained
with fretfulness.

36:18.136 --> 36:22.807
Not all of us, I suppose,
are called to great deeds.

36:24.642 --> 36:27.020
Some of us must serve
in smaller ways...

36:27.937 --> 36:31.274
even if they are
not what we would
choose for ourselves.

36:32.317 --> 36:35.153
(sighs)
Meaning no
offense, hm?

36:35.195 --> 36:37.197
None of this
is your fault.

36:38.031 --> 36:39.491
(Rhaena sighs)

36:39.616 --> 36:41.326
I want Mother.

36:42.619 --> 36:45.830
Yes... well...

36:46.831 --> 36:49.542
I know
it's difficult, but--

Prince Reggio
has answered
your letter.

37:34.754 --> 37:37.173
He'll be most pleased
to shelter Rhaenyra's

37:37.215 --> 37:39.259
youngest sons
in Pentos.

37:40.343 --> 37:42.721

I did what?

There is a large
dragon in the Vale.

A merchant cog,
the Gay Abandon,

38:38.568 --> 38:40.445
will take you to Pentos.

38:42.822 --> 38:45.283
I'll send six good men

39:05.178 --> 39:06.638
to serve alongside him

39:07.180 --> 39:11.142
and yet,
you still continue
this subterfuge.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.603
Don't want my men
to get the wrong idea.

39:13.645 --> 39:15.021
About what?

39:19.109 --> 39:21.945
-You're just like him.
-(laughs)

39:21.986 --> 39:23.780
Oh, you make an art
of provoking me.

You saved his life,
brother.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.368
Do you never
think about what
could be ours?

Or yours, anyway.

39:32.038 --> 39:35.959
The riches...
servants...

39:36.835 --> 39:38.003
the Driftwood Throne.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.337
We spent the whole
of our lives

39:39.462 --> 39:42.716
in the shadow
of the Sea Snake's
great castle.

39:42.841 --> 39:44.884
I do not wish
to dwell in it
any longer.

39:45.010 --> 39:48.346
Hm, and so you belittle
your great opportunity.

39:49.014 --> 39:53.184
While me (sucks teeth)
he ignores...

39:53.852 --> 39:55.895
as he always has.

39:57.856 --> 40:00.150
The Sea Snake
would sooner have
High Tide

40:00.191 --> 40:05.196
claimed by the sea
than call us his sons.

40:05.321 --> 40:08.992

you for it.

40:42.192 --> 40:45.070
They say you struck
Lord Bartimos today

40:45.570 --> 40:47.739
in view
of the staff
and guard.

40:48.865 --> 40:51.076

is abuzz with it.

He's lucky I did not
have his tongue.

40:55.580 --> 40:58.708
And what did he say
that was so

40:58.750 --> 41:00.418
deserving?

41:03.129 --> 41:06.216
I have tired
of being protected...

41:06.257 --> 41:07.425
Jace.

41:10.637 --> 41:12.931
I bring to mind
too much their mothers

41:12.972 --> 41:15.558
or their daughters.

41:15.600 --> 41:17.811
They must see
in me a ruler.

41:17.936 --> 41:20.105
And the symbols
of authority are not
jewels and gowns,

41:20.230 --> 41:21.773
but the shield
and the sword.

41:21.815 --> 41:24.234
My ruler is
my mother.

41:24.776 --> 41:27.320
And I do not wish
it otherwise.

41:29.948 --> 41:31.741
Will you lead us
to war yourself?

41:31.783 --> 41:33.159
Well, for a certainty
I cannot remain here,

41:33.284 --> 41:35.829
pacing the floors,
waiting for defeat
and despair to visit me.

41:35.954 --> 41:38.331
-Oh, don't be ridiculous.
-I'm doing all I can.

41:38.456 --> 41:40.792
I have directed
Lord Mooton to march
on Rook's Rest,

41:40.834 --> 41:42.419
and sent another raven
to the Vale to persuade--

41:42.460 --> 41:44.754
We may marshal
the strength
of the Vale,

41:44.796 --> 41:47.465
Maidenpool, and all
our allies besides.

41:47.799 --> 41:51.428
We will still never
match the strength
of the Green armies.

41:52.804 --> 41:55.974
We need Daemon
and his dragon.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.350
May I be free
for even one hour

41:57.475 --> 41:59.769

refrain of Daemon,
Daemon, Daemon--

47:29.474 --> 47:31.643
You were always
his favorite.

47:32.018 --> 47:33.812
Strange there
has been no word.

47:34.354 --> 47:37.440
Otto Hightower is
ever-resourceful.

47:37.482 --> 47:40.318
He will send news
when there is news
to send.

47:43.321 --> 47:45.115
I often wonder what
life could've been

47:45.156 --> 47:47.492
if he had brought
you to court instead.

47:49.869 --> 47:51.329
I'm the eldest son.

47:51.454 --> 47:53.373
It was right
that I was raised
at Oldtown.

47:53.498 --> 47:55.000
But you were
eight years of age
and motherless.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.334
It must've
been difficult.

47:56.376 --> 47:59.337
(sighs)
You get on with it,
don't you?

48:00.547 --> 48:02.799
When there
isn't any choice.

48:06.136 --> 48:07.679
My son, Daeron...

48:10.849 --> 48:12.350
what's he like?

48:12.851 --> 48:16.521
-Does he not write to you?
-Less and less these days.

48:19.024 --> 48:20.692
Ten-and-six now.

48:22.193 --> 48:25.363
Letters, perhaps,
hold less of his interest.

48:29.743 --> 48:31.745
He's stalwart.

48:32.704 --> 48:33.496
Clever.

48:33.830 --> 48:37.208
As adept with his lute
as he is with his sword.

48:38.209 --> 48:40.003
And a feature
in the fancies
of many

48:40.045 --> 48:42.380
a young lady,
I'll wager.

48:46.384 --> 48:47.886
He's kind.

48:51.765 --> 48:53.516
That's good.

48:55.101 --> 48:59.731
-Kindness is a quality I've
found lacking in his brothers.
-Mm.

49:00.023 --> 49:02.233
You did well
to send him to ward.

49:02.734 --> 49:04.569
Yes, it seems
the Red Keep,

49:04.694 --> 49:06.279
for all its
privileges,

49:06.404 --> 49:10.075
may, in fact, be a less
than salubrious environment

49:10.116 --> 49:12.035
for the forming
of young men.

49:13.244 --> 49:16.373
Was it the court
or was it their mother?

49:18.291 --> 49:20.543
I'm sure you
did your best.

49:26.257 --> 49:29.386
I must join
Ser Criston.

had his pleasure
with me.

And when,
after many months
of this,

01:04:16.481 --> 01:04:21.361
it became evident
that his seed had
taken root.

here as well.

Aegon makes choices

the mystique of him.

01:10:47.706 --> 01:10:51.084
Aemond has spun Daemon up
into being this rival of his

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:53.044
and also somebody that he wants
to emulate,

01:10:53.378 --> 01:10:55.505

his mother and a woman.

01:11:05.515 --> 01:11:08.351
So, why would she be
on the small council?

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.562
Aemond sees the world
in a very black and white way.

01:11:10.687 --> 01:11:12.230
We've always talked about
Aemond as being

01:11:12.272 --> 01:11:13.398

it's that pragmatic.

of Targaryen superiority
as dragonriders,

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:42.153
and you give it to anyone
that has Targaryen blood.

Darklyn gets intoxicated
by that idea,

I think Larys is smart enough

01:13:19.816 --> 01:13:23.111

that people are hungry.

01:13:23.194 --> 01:13:25.071

with that,

what Aemond did,

that they gained

a lot of that has been spent.

01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:08.925
I think the aristocracy
undermine people

01:15:08.967 --> 01:15:09.968
as a collective.

01:15:10.427 --> 01:15:12.345
Whoever's gonna supply them
and save them from the famine

01:15:12.429 --> 01:15:14.514
is the person they're gonna
choose to be in charge.

01:15:17.642 --> 01:15:20.145
ANDRIJ: Aemond's downfall is
that he doesn't understand

01:15:20.186 --> 01:15:21.479
the power of the small folk.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:24.107
Rhaenyra, through Mysaria,
comes to understand this.

01:15:24.274 --> 01:15:25.775
SONOYA MIZUNO:
She knows what makes them tick.

01:15:25.817 --> 01:15:26.609
She's one of them.

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:28.194
And not just how to win
their hearts,

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:30.363
but actually
what they really need.

01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:33.408
Mysaria is giving Rhaenyra
that layer

01:15:33.491 --> 01:15:35.493
that she's not getting from
anybody else in their council,

01:15:35.535 --> 01:15:37.829
which is, how do I,
from so far away,

01:15:37.871 --> 01:15:39.581
on this literal island
of Dragonstone,

01:15:39.664 --> 01:15:41.499
touch and affect
King's Landing?

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.209
And in this war,

01:15:43.293 --> 01:15:45.670
that psychological battle
is very important.

01:15:47.714 --> 01:15:50.008
RICKARD THORNE: Your Graces,
we must leave.

01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:52.802
Alicent goes through this whole
experience in this episode

01:15:52.844 --> 01:15:55.513
of having all these layers
of her family

01:15:55.555 --> 01:15:57.057
slowly stripped away from her.

01:15:57.140 --> 01:15:58.183
Her father has gone missing,

01:15:58.350 --> 01:15:59.893
and her son might not
survive his wounds.

01:15:59.976 --> 01:16:02.145
Cole is off on the march,
Aemond is a monster,

01:16:02.562 --> 01:16:04.564
and she goes to the Sept
to find comfort.

01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:07.317
And even that is not
a sanctuary for her.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.152
There's the Queen of Fishes!

01:16:09.194 --> 01:16:10.403
(GASPS)

01:16:11.529 --> 01:16:12.906
OLIVIA: There's a blockade.

01:16:13.365 --> 01:16:14.532
There's no food.

01:16:14.657 --> 01:16:17.369
The small folk are starving,

01:16:17.410 --> 01:16:19.662
and so there's no wonder
that they see the royals

01:16:19.704 --> 01:16:21.831
come in their cart
and all their finery,

01:16:21.873 --> 01:16:23.667
and it's such a slap
in the face to them.

01:16:23.708 --> 01:16:26.211
It's very Marie Antoinette,
"Let them eat cake."

01:16:26.336 --> 01:16:27.212
It's cause for revolt.

01:16:27.712 --> 01:16:30.382
The effects of Aegon
and now Aemond's reign

01:16:30.507 --> 01:16:31.508
have bubbled over

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:33.551
and nearly taken her
and Helaena's life.

01:16:33.843 --> 01:16:39.432
(BELL TOLLS)

01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:41.726
It is, as we hoped,
a warning to the usurpers

01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:44.229
that you have strength
beyond what they accredited.

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:48.024
It's been such an interesting
part of this series for me,

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:49.442
understanding that relationship.

01:16:50.026 --> 01:16:53.154
You watch two people
who are deeply suspicious

01:16:53.238 --> 01:16:56.199
of one another
develop a form of trust.

01:16:56.574 --> 01:16:59.536
SONOYA: Their relationship
has found a dynamic

01:16:59.577 --> 01:17:01.788
which is not dissimilar
to how they first met,

01:17:01.913 --> 01:17:05.291
which was this kind of
open frankness and honesty,

01:17:05.375 --> 01:17:08.712
and really taking each other
at face value.

01:17:10.547 --> 01:17:14.467
In many ways, she is the
off-council Hand of Rhaenyra.

01:17:14.718 --> 01:17:17.512
I think Mysaria's power
increases in Rhaenys' absence

01:17:17.595 --> 01:17:19.014
because I think Rhaenyra
is desperate

01:17:19.097 --> 01:17:21.474
and looking for that sympathetic
female voice in her life.

01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:22.934
Within a patriarchal structure,

01:17:22.976 --> 01:17:25.437
they underestimate both of us,
really.

01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:28.064
I believe you are meant
to be Queen.

01:17:29.733 --> 01:17:32.068
And to what extent is there
a degree of threat

01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:37.449
in watching two women begin
to guide the path to war?

01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:40.577
LORENT MARBRAND: Your Grace.

01:17:40.785 --> 01:17:42.912
The dragon Seasmoke
has been sighted.

01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:44.080
He has a rider.

01:17:45.457 --> 01:17:46.875
ANDRIJ:
Seasmoke has been claimed,

01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:49.461
and she needs to go
find out who,

01:17:50.253 --> 01:17:52.964
leaving the audience wondering
what's going to happen next.
