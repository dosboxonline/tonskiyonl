15:03.528 --> 15:05.989
I'll have
an apology from you.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.324
Ah!
The young prince!

15:08.366 --> 15:10.493
And look
at that hair.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.872
As dark as they say.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.208
Let them tell us
we don't have
Targaryen blood, eh?

15:17.834 --> 15:21.546
-My mother is the queen and--
-Dragonriders both.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.883
You and I...
cut from the same cloth.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.887
It is a sacred
inheritance of which
you know nothing.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.555
Forgive him,
my prince.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.058
He is not much
used to the manners
of court.

15:33.558 --> 15:35.352
Or any manners
at all, I'd say.

15:35.393 --> 15:38.730
Do you know
what has happened
this last hour, hm?

15:39.689 --> 15:41.358
The so-called
prince regent

15:41.399 --> 15:43.234
has burned Sharp Point
down to its stones.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.362
Thousands of its folk
dead or lost.

15:45.403 --> 15:48.198
Its harbor in ashes.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.950
Will you prepare
to face such an enemy?

15:52.410 --> 15:55.246
Or will you stay here
and make yourself easy?

15:55.288 --> 15:57.457
If you hinder
our efforts

15:57.582 --> 15:59.959
through sloth
or unreadiness,

16:00.085 --> 16:01.252
I will see
you hanged,

16:01.294 --> 16:03.797
and your body
fed to the dogs
in the street.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.759
I-I meant
no disrespect,
my prince.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.900
(indistinct chatter)

16:23.942 --> 16:26.403
Rhaenyra Targaryen:
The new riders are a boon to us,

16:26.444 --> 16:28.947
but now
the deed is done,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.574
I cannot erase
my doubts.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.576
We know little
of who they are,

16:33.618 --> 16:36.454
and what is the strength
of their character.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.790
Addam of Hull, at least,
is known to you.

16:40.125 --> 16:42.085
He's a shipwright
in my employ,

16:42.127 --> 16:45.797
and it is reported
to me that he is
a man of integrity.

16:45.922 --> 16:50.468
I've had little
to do with him...
to my regret.

16:51.136 --> 16:53.430
But the beasts
have been claimed.

16:53.471 --> 16:55.974
You now have
a great advantage.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.934
You must strike,
quickly,

16:57.976 --> 17:00.478
while the prince regent
mulls his next action.

17:01.813 --> 17:05.858
I had hoped
my advantage may be
in deterrence.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.694
Vhagar has ever been
our foremost threat,

17:07.819 --> 17:09.695
and she is now
overmatched.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.489
Vhagar is not
his only dragon.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.324
W--
The third brother
is untested,

17:13.450 --> 17:14.659
has never
left Oldtown,

17:14.784 --> 17:16.953
and his dragon is
younger than Vermax.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.496
But a dragon
nonetheless.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.665
And you forget another.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.335
Helaena?

17:23.835 --> 17:26.296
She does not ride.
She has no taste for it.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.506
She may yet
be compelled.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.383
-And her dragon--
-Dreamfyre,

17:30.508 --> 17:32.844
hatched when
the Conqueror was king.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.638
She is formidable.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.058
Still, Helaena
is no warrior.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.521
Aemond thought
himself invincible.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.191
He has now discovered
he is not.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.485
He'll be angry,
desperate.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.321
He will not stop
at burning Sharp Point,

17:51.363 --> 17:53.698
and he will
not be denied.

17:54.366 --> 17:55.825
You speak truly...

17:56.743 --> 17:58.495
though I wish it
was not so.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.997
(soft chuckle)

18:01.039 --> 18:03.041
(indistinct chatter)

18:03.500 --> 18:05.001
How goes
the Sea Snake?

18:06.503 --> 18:08.213
Better than new.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.882
We'll rejoin
the blockade
on the morrow.

18:11.216 --> 18:14.886
Let our foes beware,
be they Lannister
or Greyjoy.

18:16.346 --> 18:20.058
But...
my ship is no longer
the Sea Snake.

18:20.392 --> 18:23.687
She was a testament
to my own glory.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.022
I've given her
a new name.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.610
The Queen Who Never Was.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.239
Rhaenyra:
Corlys...

18:35.365 --> 18:37.075
I thank you.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.204
(soft chuckle)

18:41.246 --> 18:44.916
What I do now...
I do for her.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.462
Your Grace,
you are ready.

18:49.587 --> 18:52.590
You have six dragons
under your banner.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.385
My ships sail
at your command,

18:55.427 --> 18:57.053
and my men serve you.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.556
But the Lannisters
are marching,

18:59.597 --> 19:02.267
and the Hightowers
from Oldtown.

19:02.392 --> 19:06.479
You must
crush this beast
at its head

19:06.604 --> 19:09.107
and before too many
days have flown.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.154
There is,
of course...

19:14.279 --> 19:17.949
another player
that has yet
to be revealed.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.786
Ah, Your Grace,
a word.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.123
It seems the sheep
on our land has been
sold upriver.

19:25.248 --> 19:28.168
My vassals
have sent a drove
of swine instead.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.794
Dragons do eat pigs,
I assume?

19:29.919 --> 19:32.130
Caraxes prefers them.
How goes your muster?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.757
We'll be ready to march
in two days' time.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.967
-See to those pigs.
-At once, Your Grace.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.971
Your Grace...
Ser Alfred Broome
has come to see you.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.432
(laughs) Interesting.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.434
I am sent as an emissary
from the queen,

19:44.476 --> 19:46.770
to ascertain
your movements
and your intentions.

19:46.853 --> 19:48.188
You've arrived
just in time

19:48.313 --> 19:50.690
to see my new
army, Broome.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.484
What do you
think of it?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.319
It's very large.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.488
(Daemon chuckles softly)

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
Lannister hesitates.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.659
I aim to march
on King's Landing
before he can catch me.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.662
May I have
a word in private,
Your Grace?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.002
I would speak
honestly with you.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.462
Daemon Targaryen:
I'd expect nothing less.

20:12.504 --> 20:15.507
Alfred Broome:
I was faithful to the king,
your brother.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.176
I pledged my banners
to Rhaenyra, his heir.

20:18.301 --> 20:19.886
I will never serve
the usurpers

20:20.011 --> 20:21.846
or the whelps
of Oldtown,

20:21.888 --> 20:23.848
but there are battles
to be fought...

20:23.973 --> 20:26.851
-voice (whispers): Traitor.
-...and in times like this--

20:29.688 --> 20:31.648
Did you hear
something?

20:33.191 --> 20:36.069
This place will
have you barking
at the moon.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.657
While you have
mustered an army,

20:40.699 --> 20:42.492
Rhaenyra
has faltered...

20:42.534 --> 20:44.160
turning aside
from our judgment,

20:44.202 --> 20:46.413
and taking a course,
I myself, deem reckless.

20:46.538 --> 20:50.667
Rhaenyra will chart
her own course,
for good or ill.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.877
But you are
a leader of men.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.506
If you declare
yourself,

20:56.548 --> 20:58.425
your lords
will follow you.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.928
I never took you
for a turncloak...

21:02.721 --> 21:04.597
Ser Alfred.

21:07.350 --> 21:09.728
Rhaenyra's
intentions are good.

21:11.104 --> 21:15.066
But what we need,
in this moment...

21:16.568 --> 21:18.069
is a king.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.117
(tense music playing)

21:24.242 --> 21:25.910
(chuckles)

21:36.546 --> 21:37.881
(sighs)

21:37.922 --> 21:39.924
♪♪

21:44.763 --> 21:46.556
Jasper "Ironrod" Wylde:
It appears
that the Pretender

21:46.598 --> 21:48.224
sent boats to collect
those among the smallfolk

21:48.266 --> 21:50.894
who believed
they had any drop
of Targaryen blood.

21:50.935 --> 21:52.937
Deception
and subterfuge.

21:53.063 --> 21:56.107
Cowards, all of them.
Put an end to this madness.

21:56.149 --> 21:59.319
Let no vessel come
or go from our harbor
without our inspection.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.780
This will hinder the work
of the fishing boats.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.907
The people
depend on them
for sustenance.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.617
They will need
no sustenance

22:05.742 --> 22:07.952
if they
are slaughtered
by the enemy.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.413
We must all make
our sacrifices.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.085
Helaena Targaryen:
Why does everybody hate us?

22:15.126 --> 22:17.087
Alicent Hightower:
They're unhappy...

22:17.128 --> 22:19.923
and unhappy people
look for someone
to hate.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.136
We didn't order
the blockade.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.682
No, but we are
the crown, so they
expect us to break it.

22:29.808 --> 22:31.142
Drink this.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.985
I was happier
before I was queen.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.994
What would you think
about leaving this place?

22:52.664 --> 22:54.833
(birds cawing)

22:58.670 --> 23:00.672
Where would I go?

23:00.714 --> 23:02.966
(knocks on door)

23:06.970 --> 23:08.513
The prince regent,
Your Grace.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.349
Helaena. Here you are.
Mother.

23:13.727 --> 23:17.230
-I was just, just going to bed.
-The crown has need
of your service.

23:17.355 --> 23:19.858
-Now?
-The Pretender has raised
new riders against us,

23:19.983 --> 23:23.737
and we must
answer in kind.

23:23.862 --> 23:25.655
I need you to fly
with Dreamfyre
to battle.

23:25.697 --> 23:27.574
-Aemond.
-I do not wish to fight.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.826
Our wishes must take
second place now

23:29.868 --> 23:32.746
to what is necessary
to preserve the throne.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.498
I won't burn anyone.

23:37.542 --> 23:38.835
It isn't a question.

23:38.877 --> 23:40.420
-Aemond.
-They have defiled
our birthright,

23:40.545 --> 23:42.213
-made commoners
into dragonlords!
-Ow, ow!

23:42.255 --> 23:43.590
-Aemond! Aemond!
-It is a sin
and must be punished!

23:43.715 --> 23:45.675
-May I remind you your
sister is still the queen?
-Ow!

23:45.717 --> 23:47.594
As you were once!
And you see now

23:47.719 --> 23:49.179
what is the consequence
of your weakness!

23:49.220 --> 23:51.222
We are in peril today
more than yesterday!

23:51.348 --> 23:53.933
Was it peril
that moved you to burn
the town of Sharp Point?

23:54.059 --> 23:56.686
Peril or basest fury
at your own humiliation?

23:56.728 --> 23:57.604
Ow!

23:58.396 --> 23:59.856
You wish to rule
the Seven Kingdoms,

23:59.898 --> 24:02.400
but you rain
ruin and death
upon its smallfolk

24:02.442 --> 24:04.527
when you've
been insulted

24:04.569 --> 24:06.279
because it makes
you feel strong

24:06.404 --> 24:08.198
and now you seek
to corrupt your sister,

24:08.239 --> 24:10.408
of all our line,
the gentlest
and most deserving

24:10.533 --> 24:12.035
-of your protection.
-And who will protect her

24:12.077 --> 24:13.244
if she cannot
protect herself?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.788
And who will she be
if her mind is broken?!

24:14.913 --> 24:16.915
'Tis no longer our rule
that is threatened,

24:16.956 --> 24:18.083
our very lives.

24:18.208 --> 24:20.251
-Would you not
have us prevail?
-Not like this.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.882
Not like this!

24:27.217 --> 24:30.595
(light, tense music playing)

24:42.607 --> 24:44.109
Grand Maester Orwyle:
Your Grace.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.111
Grand Maester.

24:47.278 --> 24:49.823
I must again request
your assistance.

24:50.448 --> 24:52.117
I need passage.

24:52.909 --> 24:54.953
And your discretion.

24:57.622 --> 25:00.917
(solemn music playing)

25:00.959 --> 25:04.170
-(quiet chatter)
-(ambient nature sounds)

25:06.506 --> 25:09.634
Gwayne Hightower:
Do you think nothing
of your oath...

25:11.636 --> 25:13.138
Lord Commander?

25:15.098 --> 25:17.350
I think of nothing
else, my lord.

25:18.643 --> 25:20.854
Steward's son
from Dorne

25:20.979 --> 25:23.815
fucking the queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.360
Former queen.

25:28.153 --> 25:30.113
She has broken no oath,
for all I may have done.

25:30.155 --> 25:32.991
-I could send you
to the Wall.
-You could.

25:33.033 --> 25:36.036
Stain the Hightower name
for a generation.

25:36.453 --> 25:39.497
-King's mother and his Hand.
-She is my sister.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.334
(inhales)

25:42.459 --> 25:44.336
She saved my life.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.463
Twice.

25:46.504 --> 25:49.507
Once from the headsman's axe
and once from myself.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.889
Since then, she has been
the beacon I follow.

26:05.190 --> 26:09.152
Do not think I have
no shame in me, ser.

26:09.194 --> 26:12.030
Desire for women
has brought me
grief after grief.

26:12.530 --> 26:16.034
-Gwayne: Then resist it.
-(Criston chuckles softly)

26:16.701 --> 26:18.244
Oh, would that
it were so simple.

26:18.370 --> 26:21.331
Your brothers
in the Kingsguard
find a way.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.044
Do they?

26:27.545 --> 26:29.339
Mm, perhaps
they do.

26:31.049 --> 26:33.593
Or perhaps all men
are corrupt...

26:35.220 --> 26:37.931
and true honor is a mist

26:38.723 --> 26:40.225
that melts in the morning.

26:42.727 --> 26:45.063
That is a bleak philosophy.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.357
I have no philosophy.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.944
Or rather,
my philosophy
was this.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.280
To protect
the righteous

26:54.364 --> 26:57.075
and dispense justice
on the rest.

26:59.035 --> 27:00.412
But now...

27:03.623 --> 27:05.542
You saw what I saw.

27:10.588 --> 27:14.926
The dragons dance,
and men are like dust
under their feet.

27:18.263 --> 27:21.808
And all our fine thoughts,
all our... endeavors

27:21.933 --> 27:23.601
are as nothing.

27:29.274 --> 27:32.402
We march now toward

29:29.894 --> 29:33.690
King's Landing
has sent a most
doughty ambassador.

29:33.732 --> 29:35.400

testify to the worth
of the ambassador...

(pants) humble request.

consider it.

and I would not.

call it, then?

Targaryens.

can ride a dragon,

if not for the dragon

31:42.318 --> 31:43.903

of the world, Jace,

all must be subdued.

with another.

58:44.524 --> 58:48.194
-I too have desires.
-Yes, but you alone
made virtue your banner.

58:48.319 --> 58:51.489

in defiance of you,

so disdained it.

down and rule alone?

59:23.021 --> 59:25.732
No, I do not
wish to rule,
I wish to live.

59:26.191 --> 59:29.652

this endless plotting
and striving.

59:29.694 --> 59:31.988

01:00:29.921 --> 01:00:31.423
(sighs)

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:45.895
He never stopped
loving your mother,
you know?

01:00:46.438 --> 01:00:48.398
He was
very fond of me,
and I of him,

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.607
but...

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:52.944
she was the vision
that sustained him

01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:54.821
even after
she herself

01:00:54.946 --> 01:00:57.157
had slipped
from his grasp,
it was

01:00:57.282 --> 01:00:58.992
his love for her
that kept him resolute

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:00.910
in his choice
of heir.

01:01:00.952 --> 01:01:03.455
And yet, you believe
he wavered at the end.

01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:12.005
Why have you come here?

01:01:12.505 --> 01:01:13.840

Helaena as queen will be
the crown's authority.

01:01:24.142 --> 01:01:26.269
If you come then
to King's Landing,
I will see to it

throw down their arms,

01:01:28.146 --> 01:01:31.316

as a conqueror.
-(laughs)

01:01:35.945 --> 01:01:38.156

the stronger hand.

01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:40.325

01:01:40.367 --> 01:01:44.162

01:01:46.664 --> 01:01:48.166

Right.

01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:53.505
What of Aegon?

01:02:00.845 --> 01:02:04.182
He's broken
beyond recognition.

01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:08.645
He lies in the dark,
in pain and terror.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.689
He has many faults,
but...

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:12.857
he still heeds his mother.

01:02:12.899 --> 01:02:14.192
I believe I can
prevail upon him

01:02:14.317 --> 01:02:17.654
-to bend the knee,
if indeed--
-No! Still...

01:02:17.696 --> 01:02:19.364
you defend him.

01:02:21.032 --> 01:02:24.202
Still you imagine you
can have all you want

01:02:24.327 --> 01:02:25.662
without paying
too high a price,

01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:28.039

no choice but to pay.
-What I want

01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:30.333

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:34.004
If I am to take
the throne,

01:02:34.045 --> 01:02:37.215
I must put an end
to the opposition.

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.842
I must take
Aegon's head.

01:02:38.883 --> 01:02:40.719
And I have to do it
for all to see.

01:02:40.844 --> 01:02:42.554
You know this.

01:02:44.097 --> 01:02:47.183
However you may
try to evade it,
you know this.

01:02:57.902 --> 01:02:59.237

SARA HESS: Rhaenyra has choked
King's Landing with a blockade,

01:12:12.791 --> 01:12:14.000
and people are starting
to get hungry,

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:16.252

against the King,

There is a Lannister navy,
there is a Hightower navy,

but they're on the other side
of the blockade.

to bargain with the Triarchy

not on board with,

RYAN: This is where
the seat of power sits.

01:12:41.945 --> 01:12:45.115
And this is a very rich cartel
of three different nations

Corlys always went out to sea,

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:14.913
so Rhaenys never felt like
his priority.

01:14:15.038 --> 01:14:19.250
And when she died,
it finally came to Corlys

01:14:19.292 --> 01:14:21.211
that he always thought
about himself.

01:14:21.294 --> 01:14:23.922

he could do.

and understanding
that his great exploits

01:14:37.102 --> 01:14:40.814
are less important than just
having his family around him.

like they're the right person.

01:15:05.088 --> 01:15:08.133
was that nobody speaks

I wasn't expecting it
coming out of me either.

Like, it was one
of those moments

01:15:25.025 --> 01:15:27.694
where I generally felt like
I could really let go.

01:15:27.986 --> 01:15:29.863

and walking into the castle.

And he,

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.833
had to grow up in poverty.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.668
For me then to come
into his life and sort of go,

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:44.794
"I'm trying to help you,"

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:46.171
well, of course,
he's gonna be resentful.

01:15:46.379 --> 01:15:48.548

You see the way it lands
on the Seasnake.

01:15:52.177 --> 01:15:53.970
And I think he knows
that he hasn't been

that he needed to be

01:15:55.847 --> 01:15:56.723
to these guys,

01:15:57.057 --> 01:15:58.725
but I don't think he realizes
until this moment

01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:01.519
the cost that it had
on this human being.

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:03.355

From the time in season one
when he got Vhagar as a boy,

01:16:37.847 --> 01:16:39.516
that's changed
his entire outlook.

01:16:39.557 --> 01:16:42.185
And now that he's been
challenged by these new dragons,

01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:43.395
it's the first time that, like,

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.605

the upper hand

he will have no chance
against the Blacks.

And they will lose the throne
is Aegon continues to be king.

they never see you coming.

01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:13.925
That's what he's trying
to say to Aegon is,

01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:16.469
as long as Aegon
is not a threat,

01:17:16.636 --> 01:17:18.138

think he knows

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.495
when Alicent and Helaena
are both like,

01:17:42.579 --> 01:17:44.289
"Bro, calm down.

01:17:44.414 --> 01:17:48.168
This is not how somebody
who feels really sure about

01:17:48.251 --> 01:17:49.794
what they're doing behaves."

01:17:50.295 --> 01:17:53.340
EWAN MITCHELL: Helaena admits
she saw how I burned Aegon

01:17:53.506 --> 01:17:57.177
and it's hard-hitting for Aemond
to hear he's gonna go down.

01:17:57.344 --> 01:18:00.096
He kind of envisioned
after the war had finished

01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.848
he'd be seen as this war hero.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:04.517
But Helaena's prophecy
puts a stop to that.

01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:07.812
Helaena's probably put herself
in more danger with Aemond

01:18:07.854 --> 01:18:09.189
than she ever has been before.

01:18:09.647 --> 01:18:11.441
-Would you not have us prevail?
-Not like this.

01:18:11.858 --> 01:18:14.319
SARA: Aemond is gonna be
an interesting loose cannon

01:18:14.361 --> 01:18:17.489
in season three
because when Aemond is scared,

01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:20.200
laughed at, or feels small,
he lashes out.

01:18:20.533 --> 01:18:22.869
You're either with him
or you're against him.

01:18:23.036 --> 01:18:24.788
You get in his way,
you're in for a show.

01:18:29.542 --> 01:18:32.796
ALYS RIVERS:
All your life, you've sought
to command your own fate.

01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:35.840
But today, you are ready.

01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:38.134
RYAN: There are
different magics

01:18:38.176 --> 01:18:41.012
and worlds in play here
in George's universe,

01:18:41.137 --> 01:18:43.390
and Alys has been
a bit of a guide for Daemon

01:18:43.515 --> 01:18:46.309
and has made him ready
for this thing

01:18:46.351 --> 01:18:48.395
that Alys is going to show him
that he was not ready for

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.647
in episode three
when he showed up at the castle.

01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:54.067
He's evolved in some way,
and he's ready

01:18:54.693 --> 01:18:57.737
to see the future.

01:18:58.405 --> 01:19:00.657
RYAN: We wanted Daemon to have
this final experience

01:19:00.699 --> 01:19:01.700
that was undeniable to him.

01:19:01.783 --> 01:19:03.660
He's somebody that has
rejected the supernatural

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:04.536
his entire life.

01:19:04.869 --> 01:19:07.706
SARA: We definitely wanted
to tie what Daemon sees

01:19:07.747 --> 01:19:10.250
to Game of Thrones
because where it picks up,

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:13.086
it's Daenerys Targaryen
finding those eggs.

01:19:13.211 --> 01:19:16.256
She is a descendent
of Daemon and Rhaenyra

01:19:16.381 --> 01:19:18.425
and so what he ends up seeing
is that

01:19:18.508 --> 01:19:21.177
he's just this tiny piece
of this massive story

01:19:21.219 --> 01:19:22.887
and once you start to see that,

01:19:23.221 --> 01:19:25.390
you gain an entirely different
perspective.

01:19:25.890 --> 01:19:30.770
This vision brings Daemon
into the story of Fire and Ice

01:19:30.895 --> 01:19:32.731
and takes him to his death.

01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:35.567
And after his death,
it shows him

01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:38.737
that if he continues
to only think of himself,

01:19:38.778 --> 01:19:40.530
great loss will be had.

01:19:40.905 --> 01:19:42.741
And then he sees a hope.

01:19:42.866 --> 01:19:45.702
We know it's Daenerys,
but he doesn't know who it is.

01:19:46.244 --> 01:19:48.121
And he sees a White Walker,
which is cool.

01:19:48.246 --> 01:19:49.456
I was like,
"Come on, that's cool."

01:19:49.622 --> 01:19:50.790
RYAN: Even though Rhaenyra
and Daemon

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:53.752
are not going to save the realm
from the White Walkers,

01:19:53.793 --> 01:19:55.962
their actions do have an impact

01:19:56.087 --> 01:19:58.256
on how that future
is going to play out.

01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:02.135
You know your path.
(ECHOING)

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:04.095
RYAN: To evolve
from the character

01:20:04.262 --> 01:20:05.972
that stormed out of Dragonstone
in episode two,

01:20:06.056 --> 01:20:08.475
we had to see Daemon go through
all of his... (CHUCKLES)

01:20:08.892 --> 01:20:09.934
...trials and tribulations.

01:20:10.101 --> 01:20:12.645
And Rhaenyra, not knowing
what Daemon is going to do.

01:20:12.771 --> 01:20:14.397
And then you believe
he is changed,

01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:16.316
and he sees
that he is not the player,

01:20:16.441 --> 01:20:18.443
but a piece on the board,
as Alys tells him.

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:20.779
MATT SMITH: He sees Rhaenyra
on the throne,

01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.324
and I think it gives him
the confidence in himself to go,

01:20:24.449 --> 01:20:25.909
"I serve you and I'm yours."

01:20:26.284 --> 01:20:28.328
SARA: And it's not that
everything's been resolved,

01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:31.831
but Daemon realizes that his job
is to facilitate

01:20:31.915 --> 01:20:34.334
Rhaenyra getting to the throne,
and that he...

01:20:34.918 --> 01:20:39.798
understands now that Viserys
wasn't trying to punish him.

01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:42.926
And so he's able to let go
of his anger at Rhaenyra.

01:20:43.009 --> 01:20:44.344
To sort of let everything go
and,

01:20:44.469 --> 01:20:46.638
"Let's go do this together.
I'm on your team."

01:20:46.763 --> 01:20:48.598
She wasn't sure
throughout the entire season

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:51.142
if he was going to try
to set himself up as king,

01:20:51.184 --> 01:20:52.352
and it's this moment
of validation

01:20:52.477 --> 01:20:53.353
that she gets from him

01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:55.146
that I think
is incredibly meaningful.

01:20:55.438 --> 01:20:57.649
We fight for our Queen!

01:20:57.691 --> 01:21:00.860
(SOLDIERS CHEER)

01:21:03.822 --> 01:21:07.367
RHAENYRA:
Will you see it through
and make your sacrifice?

01:21:08.034 --> 01:21:09.369
A son for a son?

01:21:11.287 --> 01:21:13.206
You've seen the massive ways
that things have changed

01:21:13.331 --> 01:21:15.041
between meeting number one
and meeting number two.

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.877
And I think both of them have
been through further trauma,

01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:20.463
and it's brought them back
around to a place

01:21:20.505 --> 01:21:22.007
where they're wondering
what the cost

01:21:22.132 --> 01:21:23.216
of all this is for.

01:21:23.675 --> 01:21:26.219
It's massive that Alicent
travels to Rhaenyra.

01:21:26.344 --> 01:21:27.512
It's treason.

01:21:27.637 --> 01:21:30.056
If Aemond found out,
head on a spike.

01:21:30.181 --> 01:21:32.017
But it's also to look Rhaenyra
in the eye

01:21:32.392 --> 01:21:34.352
as my, like, rawest self.

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:37.022
"This is me shedding
whatever power

01:21:37.063 --> 01:21:38.815
or Queenly status I had.

01:21:38.898 --> 01:21:39.983
I was wrong.
Take it.

01:21:40.025 --> 01:21:42.068
I don't want anything
to do with it. I'm done."

01:21:42.527 --> 01:21:45.196
She's had this journey
of self-actualization,

01:21:45.238 --> 01:21:46.740
and she's got a lot
of power within her.

01:21:46.865 --> 01:21:50.243
And I think she feels
much more capable.

01:21:50.702 --> 01:21:53.538
It's funny to be offered
a huge gift

01:21:53.747 --> 01:21:56.249
at the point where you think
you already have what you need.

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:59.377
SARA: The climax of that scene
is Rhaenyra,

01:21:59.419 --> 01:22:00.920
"I'm going to have to kill
your son,"

01:22:01.046 --> 01:22:02.714
and Alicent acceding to it.

01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:05.342
Which is huge for Rhaenyra
because that is not something

01:22:05.425 --> 01:22:07.552
that Alicent
would ever have done before.

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:10.055
So I think that causes her
to really believe

01:22:10.096 --> 01:22:11.389
what Alicent is saying.

01:22:11.598 --> 01:22:13.725
Rhaenyra has
these new dragon riders,

01:22:13.933 --> 01:22:17.020
she's just gotten Daemon back,
she has this big army.

01:22:17.103 --> 01:22:18.271
If she wanted to,

01:22:18.355 --> 01:22:20.940
she could probably win
this war herself.

01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:24.194
But at the cost of thousands
and thousands of lives.

01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:27.113
And then she's sort of given
this backdoor by Alicent.

01:22:27.238 --> 01:22:28.948
And so I think we leave
season two

01:22:29.032 --> 01:22:33.703
with Rhaenyra in this place of,
"What am I going to do?"

01:22:34.746 --> 01:22:36.122
RYAN: It's such
a beautiful scene,

01:22:36.247 --> 01:22:37.624

by Sara,

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.584
wonderfully performed by Emma

into the third season

of what's to come,

01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:46.716
