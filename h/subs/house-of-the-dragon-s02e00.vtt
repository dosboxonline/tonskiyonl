00:05.213 --> 00:07.173
It eclipses all things,

00:07.882 --> 00:09.092
even blood.

00:10.927 --> 00:12.012
In the making of season one,

00:12.095 --> 00:14.014
we knew half that season
is a prologue

00:14.139 --> 00:16.306
and half of it
is the first act of this war.

00:16.433 --> 00:18.685
To have season one land
the way it did,

00:18.768 --> 00:20.478
with a rabid audience,

00:20.520 --> 00:23.148
fans of George and his books
the way I am.

00:23.231 --> 00:24.399
We were excited to get into it

00:24.482 --> 00:27.360
because this is the juicy part
of the drama.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.529
♪ (SOMBER MUSIC PLAYS) ♪

00:32.365 --> 00:35.577
SPEAKER:
The North owes a great duty
to the Seven Kingdoms,

00:36.077 --> 00:38.079
one older than any oath.

00:38.621 --> 00:41.124
Winterfell is the one place,
the one corner of this world

00:41.166 --> 00:43.668
where news of Luke's death
has not yet reached,

00:43.710 --> 00:48.423
and it is this hearkening back
to a simpler time.

00:48.506 --> 00:51.634
I wanted to go to a place
where we could experience that,

00:51.676 --> 00:52.552
if only briefly,

00:52.844 --> 00:55.388
and the North just felt
completely the right way to go.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.224
Ryan, when we did speak,
it really, really helped me out

00:58.308 --> 01:00.518
because we would have
conversations

01:00.560 --> 01:03.396
about how important
these negotiations are

01:03.480 --> 01:04.272
for Team Black

01:04.438 --> 01:07.025
and the difference it makes
in the war.

01:07.108 --> 01:10.028
War is coming to the whole
of the realm, My Lord.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.739
We cannot wage it without
the support of the North.

01:12.822 --> 01:14.407
HARRY COLLETT: Well,
it was all about history.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.743
There were pledges
that were made back in the day,

01:16.868 --> 01:21.414
and Jace is sent to remind
Cregan Stark of those pledges.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.209
If your greybeards can fight,
the Queen will have them.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.712
They will fight hard,
like Northerners.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.801
ALAN TAYLOR: Rhaenyra heard
the news that Luke has died

01:32.967 --> 01:34.219
on a mission
that she sent him on,

01:34.301 --> 01:35.553
so there's guilt involved.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.765
And she's a mother
who's lost a son

01:38.848 --> 01:39.640
and has to go through

01:39.723 --> 01:41.726
the sort of necessary
grieving process

01:41.768 --> 01:43.520
that Daemon, her husband,

01:43.561 --> 01:45.979
can't really appreciate
or understand.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.067
She goes and tries to make peace
with Luke's demise,

01:49.109 --> 01:50.110
but she cannot settle in it

01:50.193 --> 01:51.444
because it is
unsettled business,

01:51.527 --> 01:53.905
until part of Arrax
washes ashore.

01:54.114 --> 01:57.575
Going in search of evidence is

01:57.616 --> 01:59.327
quite fundamentally important
to her.

01:59.411 --> 02:03.748
I guess one of the sort of
maddest things about death

02:03.790 --> 02:05.250
is that it seems
sort of impossible,

02:05.583 --> 02:08.836
especially because really
the overriding feeling often is

02:08.919 --> 02:10.213
you just sit with the absence.

02:10.295 --> 02:13.133
And so, anything that has, like,
a tangibility about it

02:13.216 --> 02:14.759
I think is vitally important.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.138
Her son's cloak,
the wing of his dragon,

02:18.221 --> 02:19.723
I think it's devastating,

02:19.764 --> 02:24.102
but I think it galvanizes
a vengeful feeling,

02:24.436 --> 02:27.272
one that maybe she hasn't
paid so much mind to previously.

02:27.939 --> 02:30.150
(SYRAX ROARS)

02:31.776 --> 02:34.154
EVE BEST:
I think that Rhaenys is probably
one of the few people

02:34.237 --> 02:35.947
that Daemon knows
he can't mess with,

02:36.031 --> 02:37.906
although I suspect
probably wants to.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.952
We're going to King's Landing.

02:41.036 --> 02:43.038
-To what end?
-Killing Vhagar.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.290
When those two meet,
it's kind of like

02:45.331 --> 02:50.003
a panther meets
a kind of electric eel.

02:50.086 --> 02:52.464
Really dangerous combination.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.134
He's essentially ready
to go to war and get payback.

02:56.551 --> 02:58.178
RYAN CONDAL: It was nice
to throw those characters

02:58.261 --> 02:59.888
into conflict with one another.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.891
I think you can tell
from even her demeanor

03:02.932 --> 03:04.684
the way Rhaenys
thinks of Daemon.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.644
Daemon believes that he's,
of course,

03:06.728 --> 03:07.520
completely in the right

03:07.771 --> 03:09.939
and has the power
to order Rhaenys around.

03:10.106 --> 03:11.316
Fly with me.

03:12.650 --> 03:13.735
It is a command.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.737
Would that you were the king.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.864
AEGON II TARGARYEN:
Where is Jaehaerys?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.324
What do you need of him?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.201
I'm taking him
to the Small Council.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.079
He'll be king one day.
He must begin his instruction.

03:24.329 --> 03:26.373
What if he does not want
to be king?

03:27.832 --> 03:28.667
(WHISPERS) Where is he?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.460
One of the things I loved
about Game of Thrones

03:30.502 --> 03:31.586
was the character humor.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.380
And, you know,
we can spend a lot of time

03:33.463 --> 03:34.506
being dour in this world,

03:34.589 --> 03:36.007
and it's so important
to have humor.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.091
And when I first saw

03:37.216 --> 03:38.677
what Tom Glynn-Carney was doing
with Aegon,

03:38.718 --> 03:40.929
I thought, "He's finding humor
where I didn't know it existed."

03:41.012 --> 03:42.138
And it's painful,

03:42.180 --> 03:43.765
a guy who's way in
over his head,

03:43.848 --> 03:45.183
who really wants to do well

03:45.266 --> 03:47.018
but just can't make
a right move...

03:47.102 --> 03:49.145
(LAUGHS)
...no matter what he does.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.690
SPEAKER 2:
Aegon the Magnanimous.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.441
Hail King Aegon!

03:54.359 --> 03:55.694
The Magnanimous?

03:57.529 --> 03:59.864
I think Aegon is
the kind of father

03:59.906 --> 04:02.742
that encourages bad behavior
because he finds it funny.

04:02.826 --> 04:03.868
He loves his kids.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.370
I have no doubt about that.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.663
He loves his kids dearly.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.290
But he's not one
to discipline them.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.251
If anything, he's, you know,

04:11.376 --> 04:12.669
having competitions
with his children

04:12.711 --> 04:14.879
to see who can be
the most rebellious.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.673
And Aegon often wins.

04:16.755 --> 04:17.632
He took my piece.

04:17.841 --> 04:19.926
Is the heir to the throne
bothering you, Tyland?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.595
We see him come into
a Small Council meeting

04:22.679 --> 04:23.596
with Jaehaerys,

04:23.722 --> 04:26.266
and, you know,
he's spurring him on.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.811
He's wanting him to be
more of a-- more of a rebel,

04:29.894 --> 04:32.564
more of a nuisance,
just like his old man.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.233
-I think he wants a ride.
-ALICENT HIGHTOWER: Your Grace.

04:35.316 --> 04:37.110
-TYLAND LANNISTER: A ride?
-A pony ride.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.195
Wouldn't that be fun,
Jaehaerys?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.614
Should the Master of Coin
be your royal steed?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.033
(ALL CHUCKLING)

04:43.116 --> 04:44.576
It's meant to be
a moment of fun, a bit.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.746
And yes, like Aegon brings
his four-year-old to work.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.873
But I think on a perhaps
nuanced character level,

04:49.956 --> 04:52.500
this is the thing that Viserys
never did for Aegon.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.377
And Aegon did not study
at the feet of his father.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.838
His father had his male heir
and then essentially said,

04:56.921 --> 04:59.132
"Well, that box is ticked."
He was ill.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.759
I think he enjoyed having a son,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.053
but didn't put in the work
the way he did with Rhaenyra

05:03.136 --> 05:04.179
when he was a younger man.

05:04.262 --> 05:05.930
And I think Aegon resents that

05:06.139 --> 05:07.557
and feels that
part of the reason

05:07.599 --> 05:09.225
that he's not seen
as being suited

05:09.267 --> 05:11.394
for the crown
or the throne

05:11.603 --> 05:14.439
is because he didn't get
that training from his father,

05:14.564 --> 05:17.150
so now he's going to
make up for that tenfold

05:17.233 --> 05:18.443
with Jaehaerys.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.114
ALAN: Alicent's been
in a marriage that was loving,

05:23.198 --> 05:27.118
but not exactly romantic
or physical for quite some time.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.912
Cole has got a lot of issues.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.372
One thing I love
about the character

05:30.455 --> 05:32.165
is that he is a knight
in shining armor

05:32.248 --> 05:33.291
and sort of classically handsome

05:33.582 --> 05:35.710
and probably the most
messed up person in the story

05:35.794 --> 05:36.586
in many ways.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.672
You know, clinging to notions
of purity and duty

05:38.755 --> 05:41.383
and just flagrantly
breaking them left and right.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.093
So, there's a lot
of complex things

05:43.176 --> 05:44.969
driving the moves
closer and closer

05:45.011 --> 05:46.137
between Alicent and Cole.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.639
And it takes a leap forward.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.848
But nothing is simple with them,

05:48.973 --> 05:50.850
so for every leap forward,
there's a push back.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.728
We cannot... again.

05:54.020 --> 05:55.730
ALAN: There's a lot
of wonderful tension there.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.900
I mean, I think there's love,
but there's a lot of mess too.

05:58.983 --> 05:59.984
(LAUGHS)

06:00.402 --> 06:01.903
-Your Grace.
-Good day.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.405
FABIEN FRANKEL:
I think, ultimately,

06:03.613 --> 06:08.827
they're two very lost people
in a pretty unforgiving world.

06:09.160 --> 06:11.454
And I think there's always been,

06:11.496 --> 06:13.498
you know,
since the very first episode,

06:13.623 --> 06:15.417
Alicent, you know,
had her eye on Criston Cole.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.419
And then she was a young lady,

06:17.502 --> 06:20.797
and now she's
the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.800
OLIVIA COOKE: It's paramount
that she keeps it a secret

06:23.883 --> 06:27.012
because not only
would her respect

06:27.095 --> 06:29.139
completely disintegrate,

06:29.180 --> 06:31.599
but her stay in the castle.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.352
And Aegon is so unpredictable.
Who knows what he would do

06:34.436 --> 06:38.189
if he found out
that his mother was having sex

06:38.273 --> 06:40.400
with his
Commander of the Kingsguard?

06:40.525 --> 06:42.277
I mean, not only is it
an embarrassment,

06:42.360 --> 06:45.947
it would bring deep, deep shame.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.162
I want Aemond Targaryen.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.249
Rhaenyra has literally one line
in the first episode,

06:56.374 --> 06:57.542
and the one line she says,

06:57.876 --> 07:00.003
Daemon takes
as pulling the trigger.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.881
In our first episode,
we see him unleash something

07:02.964 --> 07:05.383
that is sort of famous in
the lore of House of the Dragon,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.594
a nasty event that he triggers.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.765
When Rhaenyra declares
that she wants Aemond,

07:11.890 --> 07:16.728
I think it's an admission
of a possibly shameful desire,

07:16.853 --> 07:19.856
and I think that admission
is made directly to Daemon.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.026
I think it's also an admission
of their similarity.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.071
She sort of discloses
another way in which

07:26.154 --> 07:28.907
they actually share a darkness.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.409
"I want Aemond Targaryen"
becomes the battle cry

07:32.494 --> 07:34.704
that then resonates
across the entire season

07:34.788 --> 07:37.374
because that is
the next domino to fall

07:37.457 --> 07:40.001
in this back and forth
that sets in motion

07:40.085 --> 07:41.961
a horrible attack
and counterattack

07:42.045 --> 07:42.837
that continues,

07:43.171 --> 07:45.548
and the atrocities grow worse
and worse as they go.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.759
ALAN: In our story,
it's Mysaria,

07:47.801 --> 07:49.928
who has got her tentacles into
every part of King's Landing,

07:49.969 --> 07:52.055
who is able to provide
the connections

07:52.138 --> 07:54.432
for Daemon to exact revenge.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.101
I think it really is a big deal
for the fans

07:56.142 --> 07:57.435
because it keeps
getting referred to.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.521
And I don't know
the characters' actual names.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.773
They're forever in lore
as Blood and Cheese.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.192
-(LAUGHING)
-Who the fuck is she?

08:04.275 --> 08:05.735
She's the Queen, she is.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.696
"A son for a son," he said.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.239
The boldest thing that
I think we did there

08:09.322 --> 08:11.991
was decide to give the last
ten minutes of the episode

08:12.117 --> 08:14.619
over to these two characters
that we have never met before

08:14.703 --> 08:17.455
and rely on them to take us
through the end of the story

08:17.539 --> 08:19.124
and to see, hopefully,

08:19.165 --> 08:21.084
as they go deeper and deeper
into the Red Keep

08:21.167 --> 08:23.003
and as we're spending more
and more screen time on them

08:23.086 --> 08:25.505
that something horrible
is going to happen in there,

08:25.588 --> 08:27.966
and knowing that you're watching
Game of Thrones

08:28.008 --> 08:30.760
and you don't know what is going
to come for you from where.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.886
And seeing that play out
hopefully is the fun

08:32.971 --> 08:35.807
and the horror for the audience
that's yet to come.
