But I believe
it is a sin to deny
your appetites.

22:14.501 --> 22:17.962
They are what
make us fully alive

you would be the most
aggrieved, my lord.

22:34.312 --> 22:36.773

for our greater good.

your swords...
do you?

30:09.809 --> 30:11.019
Some 20 years ago,

30:11.019 --> 30:13.146
my lord bent the knee
to King Viserys

30:13.146 --> 30:16.441
and acknowledged
the Princess Rhaenyra
as his rightful heir.

30:16.566 --> 30:18.276
Daemon:
So you fight
for this old oath?

30:18.401 --> 30:21.571
Not, of course,
for your thousand-year-old
feud with the Brackens.

30:23.114 --> 30:25.617
I once vied
for Queen Rhaenyra's
hand...

30:26.242 --> 30:28.286
before she wed
Ser Laenor.

30:28.787 --> 30:30.914
I always liked
her spirit.

30:31.414 --> 30:33.291
She had
the true blood
of the dragon.

30:33.291 --> 30:37.587

to march without
the leave of your lord...

and your dragon

31:04.489 --> 31:07.826

to the Brackens...

31:08.159 --> 31:10.370

Larys:
Our lords in the Crownlands
are grousing.

31:22.132 --> 31:24.009

struggle to keep pace

31:24.009 --> 31:25.635

relentless appetites.

31:25.635 --> 31:28.179
- Vhagar's in particular.
- Ironrod:
They can either provide

31:28.179 --> 31:31.307

or we can claim their holdings.

31:31.307 --> 31:32.934

Oh, that would be a relief,

to lend to the effort.

The demand on the blacksmiths,
armorers and tanners

31:41.151 --> 31:42.527

only grown apace

31:42.527 --> 31:43.737
