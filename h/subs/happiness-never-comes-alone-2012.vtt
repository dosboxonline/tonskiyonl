01:49.125 --> 01:50.911
- For sacha!
- Thanks, Jules.

01:51.083 --> 01:54.405
Jules owns the jazz club
where I sometimes play.

01:54.583 --> 01:58.326
I play for free
but an open bar beats any salary.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.788
Laurent, my best friend since... 3rd grade.

02:01.958 --> 02:04.791
We're writing a show. Our show!

02:04.958 --> 02:07.415
Lionel, my other best friend.

02:07.583 --> 02:09.073
Met kris in med school.

02:09.542 --> 02:11.498
Took them 15 years to have a kid.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.157
Not my godson, thank god.

02:13.333 --> 02:16.496
I have to tell you. I hate kids!

02:16.833 --> 02:18.789
For some it's spiders or snakes.

02:18.958 --> 02:20.823
For me it's kids.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.412
She's car... Cal... cor...

02:23.542 --> 02:25.248
Let's say Valerie.

02:26.250 --> 02:28.832
Model, 24, bubble butt, bubblehead.

02:29.042 --> 02:32.534
Perfect formula for a
perfect one-night stand.

02:32.917 --> 02:33.952
Total bliss.

02:38.542 --> 02:40.032
I like my life as it is.

02:40.208 --> 02:43.405
No alarm clock, no wedding ring, no taxes.

03:15.875 --> 03:18.241
I was free, with my piano and my pals.

03:18.417 --> 03:20.157
My life was a metronome.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.996
Till that Tuesday in may,
a Tuesday like any other.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.989
"Happiness never comes alone"

03:38.000 --> 03:39.456
morning, precious.

03:42.167 --> 03:44.829
I brought schnitzel and strawberries.

03:45.958 --> 03:47.789
We finished at 6 A.M.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.414
And your real job?

03:49.750 --> 03:51.741
Real job in the real world?

03:51.917 --> 03:54.624
The one you live off, not drink off.

03:55.250 --> 03:56.831
Don't touch, mom!

03:57.042 --> 03:58.873
Why do you touch?

03:59.792 --> 04:01.373
Because I'm your mother.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.167
Yeah, xav?

04:04.167 --> 04:05.623
Give teacher your notes.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.581
I was just about to.

04:07.750 --> 04:10.947
I like to hear the jingle
before the client.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.366
You forget work, grandma's check up...

04:14.583 --> 04:16.995
I told you 8 A.M. is too early.

04:17.125 --> 04:18.285
You didn't start?

04:18.458 --> 04:21.074
It's in an hour. Chick poacher is coming!

04:21.417 --> 04:22.623
20 minutes, okay?

04:23.083 --> 04:25.790
Chick poacher is coming to the meeting.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Hello, ma'am.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.540
Goodbye, miss... good luck.

04:31.500 --> 04:33.331
- Rewind.
- Don't be a pain.

04:34.042 --> 04:37.955
I'll do that tomorrow.
He needs music. I'm in a rush.

04:38.125 --> 04:39.990
A real life, a real woman.

04:40.125 --> 04:41.125
Tomorrow...

04:41.250 --> 04:42.865
- Kids.
- Tomorrow, mom.

04:43.042 --> 04:44.373
Tomorrow, tomorrow...

04:45.083 --> 04:46.198
A bird.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.414
Just like your father.

04:49.250 --> 04:51.582
- Tomorrow never comes.
- He was right.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.498
Mom, I love you.

04:59.042 --> 05:01.283
Orange and lemon

05:01.542 --> 05:03.749
with chocolate filling...

05:22.833 --> 05:23.833
Thanks, lzsak!

05:24.083 --> 05:26.745
They're all here. Chick poacher on his way.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.789
Cadbury called. No budget.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.581
Enough to wax your legs.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.706
And get a foot in the door.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.499
2 jingles a month. No need to overdo it.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.953
They like your music. Hard to refuse.

05:38.125 --> 05:40.207
- When is it for?
- It's him!

05:46.917 --> 05:47.917
Hey, xav.

05:48.375 --> 05:50.366
Frank, our new marketing director.

05:50.792 --> 05:53.499
Xavier ferhat,
project director at the ad agency.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.327
I have 5 minutes.

05:58.625 --> 06:01.241
Mr. posche, our team at europub.

06:01.375 --> 06:04.617
Lea, assistant, Laurent
sabi, the director...

06:04.792 --> 06:06.282
- 3 minutes.
- Run it.

06:17.917 --> 06:21.580
Orange and lemon, with chocolate filling

06:28.417 --> 06:30.703
- Too red.
- We'll take it down.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.456
The palette we got...

06:32.583 --> 06:33.618
Minus 5, okay.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.825
The music starts and ends well
but bogs in the middle.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.786
- Play it back.
- No need.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.448
The music lasts 5 seconds.

06:56.542 --> 06:57.782
Give us more notes.

06:58.167 --> 06:59.202
More notes?

06:59.375 --> 07:01.787
Those little dots, black and white.

07:01.958 --> 07:03.664
More notes. Why not?

07:03.833 --> 07:06.324
I'll take note then send you the note.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.991
No problem. The changes for tomorrow.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.625
Come with me.

07:10.667 --> 07:13.283
Thanks, Alain. Xavier, the short version.

07:14.083 --> 07:16.324
Laurent, come to the agency.

07:16.458 --> 07:17.664
Music tomorrow!

07:31.958 --> 07:33.494
Izsak... thanks!

07:49.750 --> 07:52.366
Motherfucking goddamn asshole.

07:52.792 --> 07:54.623
Look at this idiot.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.207
His jalopy almost killed me.

07:57.625 --> 08:00.367
Idiotic car. Imbecile!

08:00.792 --> 08:02.703
Want a ride? I'm parked here.

08:04.042 --> 08:05.998
No thanks, I'll be fine.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.453
My car's a swimming pool.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.782
You got nothing to lose.

08:25.667 --> 08:26.667
Sach!

08:26.792 --> 08:27.792
Your keys!

08:30.125 --> 08:31.240
Unbelievable.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.083
Sacha.

09:01.417 --> 09:02.532
Charlotte.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.664
Sacharlotte.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.744
You have to disinfect your knee.

09:56.708 --> 09:58.073
You have to...

09:58.667 --> 10:00.123
Disinfect here.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.740
I need some tea.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.662
Sacha Keller, like the pianist?

10:17.792 --> 10:18.998
He was my father.

10:21.750 --> 10:25.322
I have his first name,
his car, and his piano.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.248
Do you play well?

10:30.167 --> 10:33.034
What could you have heard of mine?

10:33.292 --> 10:36.739
At airports,
when they announce something,

10:36.917 --> 10:38.032
there's music first.

10:38.792 --> 10:39.792
You?

10:40.625 --> 10:42.035
Is that you?

10:43.375 --> 10:45.957
But train stations are me.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.869
Does this ring a bell?

10:55.625 --> 10:56.740
Not bad.

10:59.375 --> 11:03.118
It's short but it mustn't be easy...

11:05.583 --> 11:08.199
Composing something that's catchy.

11:10.167 --> 11:13.659
Were you there just to fall on your face?

11:15.625 --> 11:17.832
Always fall in the same spot?

11:18.000 --> 11:19.285
I work there.

11:19.458 --> 11:20.948
At line?

11:21.167 --> 11:22.577
At the foundation.

11:23.292 --> 11:26.364
With the money from diapers and yogurt,

11:26.833 --> 11:29.119
we organize contemporary art shows.

11:29.208 --> 11:33.326
We give out grants.
We try to foster young talent.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.616
You work for chick poacher's wife.

11:42.583 --> 11:46.906
The day il... heard his
nickname, I left him.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.448
Two years ago.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.581
We had an open relationship.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.116
I was relationship. He was open.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.037
You're the wife of...

12:04.708 --> 12:07.040
Chi... of Alain posche?

12:15.708 --> 12:16.993
This is pointless.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.078
There's a point to it all.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.417
Just one.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.619
A kiss is just a kiss.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.369
"Casablanca". It's my movie.

12:53.958 --> 12:54.993
My movie.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.493
Here?

13:08.417 --> 13:10.999
That's Alain's place. I live there.

13:23.625 --> 13:24.865
Lively neighborhood.

13:26.958 --> 13:27.958
Atmosphere.

13:31.083 --> 13:32.539
Where do you live?

13:34.167 --> 13:35.907
Near montmartre.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.658
Less deserted than here.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.500
True.

13:49.667 --> 13:51.282
Okay... goodbye.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.573
In a sec, a bald guy

13:58.750 --> 14:01.366
will sue you for touching his dumb car.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.203
Mrs. posche's Porsche.

14:53.875 --> 14:54.990
Take me away.

16:10.458 --> 16:12.949
Is your show a musical?

16:14.750 --> 16:17.332
The show you're writing is a musical?

16:17.625 --> 16:21.038
No it's a... show show.

16:23.333 --> 16:24.493
I play piano.

16:24.667 --> 16:28.239
My friend Laurent
conceived visuals for the music.

16:31.417 --> 16:35.160
There's magic, shadow play, dance...

16:35.333 --> 16:37.039
Several levels of...

16:37.917 --> 16:38.997
What time is it?

16:39.167 --> 16:40.031
What?

16:40.167 --> 16:41.498
What time is it?

16:46.375 --> 16:47.375
7:30.

16:47.875 --> 16:48.875
Shit!

16:49.167 --> 16:50.167
What is it?

16:51.083 --> 16:52.323
I'm late.

16:53.250 --> 16:54.740
I'm extremely late.

16:59.333 --> 17:00.493
Extremely late.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.741
- Careful behind you.
- We'll talk...

17:08.208 --> 17:09.208
Are you okay?

17:11.750 --> 17:14.412
Check your body. Your bones.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.456
- I'm fine.
- I'll drive you.

17:17.792 --> 17:18.792
I'm late.

17:19.708 --> 17:22.370
0625752002.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.831
Or 0143...

17:27.750 --> 17:30.662
6655... sixty... sexty...

17:32.958 --> 17:33.958
Vincenzo!

17:34.833 --> 17:36.323
The pasta, pure Mozart.

17:36.583 --> 17:37.993
For you, Lionel.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.207
- Pure Mozart.
- Verdi's purer.

17:42.167 --> 17:44.874
Verdi, violetta, Alfredo!

17:50.833 --> 17:52.073
Sacha, here.

18:10.208 --> 18:11.208
I did it!

18:11.833 --> 18:13.539
- 1 did it!
- Getting married?

18:14.667 --> 18:15.907
We got the adami!

18:25.167 --> 18:26.828
We got the adami.

18:33.792 --> 18:35.032
What's the adami?

18:35.875 --> 18:37.581
No idea but he seems happy.

18:44.250 --> 18:47.447
You stole demos from my computer
to get a Grant?

18:48.875 --> 18:50.331
- Damn youl!
- For real.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.491
The show's less than an hour!

18:52.667 --> 18:55.329
The mogador wants to meet us!

18:55.458 --> 18:56.868
For real!

18:57.250 --> 18:58.930
The mogador theater! Mamma Mia, lion king!

18:59.458 --> 19:01.164
We have one month, tops!

19:01.583 --> 19:03.744
- The mogador.
- Yes! For real!

19:05.083 --> 19:06.323
- One month.
- Yes!

19:06.542 --> 19:08.203
We'll never be ready.

19:09.417 --> 19:13.205
For real, this is our big break.
We'll work nonstop.

19:13.500 --> 19:14.865
Even if... no.

19:15.042 --> 19:17.454
We'll do it. Come on, it's our show!

19:17.750 --> 19:18.865
Yeah, our show.

19:19.667 --> 19:22.079
- It's our show.
- Atta boy!

19:22.917 --> 19:24.157
- Our show!
- You bet!

19:25.042 --> 19:26.042
We rock!

19:26.125 --> 19:28.457
I'm happy as hell! Aren't you?

19:29.208 --> 19:31.369
You're right. I am happy.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.998
You must like flying rocks.

19:43.167 --> 19:44.532
Totally.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.124
I'm not in the top 1% so I'm going.

19:48.292 --> 19:50.248
You get to leave the suburbs,

19:50.417 --> 19:54.205
see your sister, meet people.
All you do is work, cecile.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.744
- That's life.
- So live!

19:56.917 --> 19:58.123
Meet someone...

19:58.292 --> 19:59.292
You too.

20:02.833 --> 20:03.833
Stop!

20:04.542 --> 20:06.157
- Who?
- It's nothing.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.618
He's your age?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.748
I didn't say anything!

20:10.917 --> 20:12.748
He's poor. And left-wing!

20:13.792 --> 20:15.783
I'm not gonna give up.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.582
I'll check the flowers and bye-bye.

20:18.708 --> 20:21.780
Your bouquets are perfect. Just tell me...

20:22.000 --> 20:24.787
- Come to lunch on Sunday.
- I'm working.

20:24.917 --> 20:26.248
You work 24/7.

20:26.542 --> 20:27.827
Price of freedom.

20:28.583 --> 20:29.789
I'm free!

20:30.167 --> 20:34.035
For someone separated for 2 years,
you act like a wife!

20:43.083 --> 20:45.290
- Thalia, my agent.
- Great show.

20:45.458 --> 20:47.824
A reference to nagi noda.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.625
The guy who vomited this needs a shrink.

20:51.792 --> 20:52.792
Here he is.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.199
Very talented, my man.

20:58.458 --> 21:00.414
You find such awful places!

21:01.292 --> 21:03.123
Monsieur le ministre, my wife.

21:03.292 --> 21:04.452
Good evening, sir.

21:05.250 --> 21:06.990
Finally real art.

21:07.167 --> 21:08.873
Come this way.

21:12.292 --> 21:14.749
Stunning... a marvelous place.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.164
He sleeps only here.

21:27.292 --> 21:30.159
Good idea, multi-colored smoke bubbles.

21:33.917 --> 21:35.032
Show me.

21:37.167 --> 21:39.533
"How's the show show?" Charlotte.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.164
What's Charlotte?

21:42.875 --> 21:45.412
It's code for "I'm naked naked."

21:45.917 --> 21:48.249
- You're such pains.
- Who's Charlotte?

21:48.542 --> 21:49.657
How old is she?

21:49.833 --> 21:51.289
- She's...
- For real!

21:52.000 --> 21:53.911
Twenty-three... four... thirty...

21:54.167 --> 21:55.167
Thirty-five.

21:55.750 --> 21:56.750
35 years old.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.581
For real, is she gray?

22:02.750 --> 22:04.911
For you 35 is like screwing jello.

22:06.042 --> 22:07.077
Not nice.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.831
Wait till you see her.

22:09.292 --> 22:13.205
I can't explain it. She has eyes...
Teeth...

22:13.333 --> 22:16.200
She has teeth? At 35? How did she do it?

22:16.375 --> 22:18.161
She's beautiful...

22:18.333 --> 22:20.870
"Show show, heating up, up."

22:23.000 --> 22:25.707
"Heating up... in my boxers!"

22:26.083 --> 22:28.039
- Stop!
- For real, introduce me.

22:28.208 --> 22:30.540
- For real!
- Stop saying "for real".

22:30.708 --> 22:32.573
For real, I don't say for real.

22:32.750 --> 22:33.910
Full of love.

22:34.083 --> 22:37.075
You sickos find it funny?

22:40.542 --> 22:42.157
"My bed is ice cold."

22:44.625 --> 22:46.240
For real, no work tonight?

22:46.583 --> 22:49.450
Jim... can you fill in for me?

22:49.750 --> 22:51.661
I'll take Thursday.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.866
I didn't think you'd come.

23:15.167 --> 23:16.452
You forgot one.

23:19.875 --> 23:20.875
Hold on...

23:22.875 --> 23:23.990
Don't move.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.117
You... forgot... just...

23:29.583 --> 23:30.583
One.

23:59.583 --> 24:00.993
My favorite movie.

24:21.500 --> 24:22.159
Again.

24:22.333 --> 24:23.333
Mommy...

24:27.958 --> 24:29.573
Come here, honey.

24:30.750 --> 24:31.750
Go to sleep.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.618
It's Leonard.

24:50.875 --> 24:51.875
Come with me.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.083
Where?

24:53.542 --> 24:54.542
Come.

24:59.167 --> 25:01.123
This is Suzy's room.

25:05.875 --> 25:07.456
Turn out the lights.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
That's Louis.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.866
Relax, they're just kids.

25:17.875 --> 25:18.875
Kids.

25:22.583 --> 25:23.583
There are more?

25:26.750 --> 25:27.785
It's the bathroom.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.667
You okay?

25:37.625 --> 25:38.705
You don't seem it.

25:39.625 --> 25:41.331
It's just that...

25:42.625 --> 25:43.625
It's nothing.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.374
I'm not used to little friends.

25:46.542 --> 25:48.578
Chill out. They're not contagious.

25:49.000 --> 25:50.911
- Bye.
- I didn't say that.

25:51.042 --> 25:53.499
You didn't say anything. Goodnight.

25:54.792 --> 25:55.792
Talk soon.

25:59.833 --> 26:01.039
Talk soon.

26:01.750 --> 26:02.910
I am so dumb.

26:12.667 --> 26:15.739
Little bit of lemon, some vanilla too

26:16.000 --> 26:18.286
and the fizz is, the fizz is

26:18.458 --> 26:20.870
enough to make you dizzy

26:37.125 --> 26:38.365
It's wonderful.

26:40.917 --> 26:42.703
I want two for December.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.865
Thank you, Charlotte!

26:49.417 --> 26:50.782
You're a lifesaver.

26:51.292 --> 26:53.658
A show that's only on today.

26:54.167 --> 26:55.577
That's impossible.

26:55.917 --> 26:56.917
He insisted.

26:57.042 --> 26:58.327
Mak lov tu-mi

26:58.500 --> 27:00.115
"make love to me".

27:15.250 --> 27:16.911
You almost met another guy.

27:23.792 --> 27:25.407
I thought that was it.

27:26.708 --> 27:30.747
I remembered the aristocats
was my favorite cartoon.

27:31.333 --> 27:32.869
Why the aristocats?

27:33.625 --> 27:36.037
Your kids. The three kittens.

27:36.542 --> 27:38.624
Duchess, O'Malley...

27:39.167 --> 27:41.453
They don't know, so no need to fret.

27:52.083 --> 27:53.323
It's a button fly.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.911
Charlotte, what's the...

28:05.208 --> 28:06.948
Are you married or separated?

28:07.750 --> 28:11.368
I just told him I was having a drink
with my sister.

28:12.167 --> 28:14.158
He's still my boss.

28:24.917 --> 28:26.657
Mommy! It's Leonard!

28:29.625 --> 28:31.957
Change your ringtone. That's scary.

28:32.125 --> 28:34.207
- I have to answer.
- Damn kids.

28:34.417 --> 28:35.497
Yes, honey?

28:37.292 --> 28:38.828
Nana took his temperature?

28:40.833 --> 28:41.993
I'm coming.

28:50.042 --> 28:51.157
Want a ride?

28:55.167 --> 28:57.078
Come when they're asleep.

28:57.250 --> 28:58.250
No.

29:01.583 --> 29:05.371
Sorry, I'm running late.
I didn't see the time.

29:06.417 --> 29:09.454
Leonard has a sore throat.
He wouldn't sleep.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.832
Can you put him in his bed?

31:10.583 --> 31:11.823
To bed...

31:16.250 --> 31:18.366
Sleep the slumber...

31:19.708 --> 31:21.323
Of the night

31:22.125 --> 31:24.787
close each eye

31:25.083 --> 31:26.869
till you die

31:27.333 --> 31:30.746
you're a midget version of...

31:30.917 --> 31:32.623
Philip Seymour Hoffman

31:33.167 --> 31:35.374
I went away...

31:50.208 --> 31:51.539
He almost woke up.

32:01.625 --> 32:02.785
Got a toolbox?

32:08.708 --> 32:10.118
All in a day's work.

32:24.292 --> 32:25.292
You okay?

32:35.667 --> 32:37.749
Forget it. I'll get a plumber.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.867
This is too humiliating. I'll do it.

32:45.958 --> 32:46.958
You okay?

33:02.375 --> 33:04.081
At least the leak stopped.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.994
There's water everywhere!

33:13.708 --> 33:15.244
It's daytime!

33:16.250 --> 33:18.366
I'm wet. Can I borrow a shirt?

33:18.958 --> 33:20.664
Wear your own clothes.

33:21.250 --> 33:22.410
The white one!

33:22.583 --> 33:25.495
White one? You can have it. Show me.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.407
- It's a gift?
- It's leaking!

33:27.583 --> 33:28.583
It's a gift?

33:29.250 --> 33:31.115
I'm late for school.

33:35.708 --> 33:37.369
Don't go in my room!

33:41.542 --> 33:43.407
Stay out of my room!

33:45.833 --> 33:47.539
No more captain crunch!

33:49.958 --> 33:52.995
No more captain crunch. It's not funny.

33:53.167 --> 33:56.614
Helen will get more.
Now you get toast and Nutella.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.365
Who are you?

34:12.583 --> 34:13.743
Why are you here?

34:19.292 --> 34:20.748
You're naked?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.250
Yes.

34:23.417 --> 34:24.907
Trust me, you're naked.

34:26.292 --> 34:27.828
Steer clear of my family.

34:28.708 --> 34:29.948
I can't hear.

34:30.667 --> 34:32.623
Steer clear of my family!

34:34.417 --> 34:35.577
Bye, mom!

34:36.750 --> 34:37.750
Hi, dad.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.665
You look pretty. We have time.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.665
Madame, there is naked man...

34:56.792 --> 34:59.204
The revolution ended the old...

34:59.375 --> 35:00.375
Socks!

35:00.750 --> 35:01.364
Boxers!

35:01.542 --> 35:03.874
- Testament?
- No, the old regime.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.078
56,7...

35:17.583 --> 35:21.405
And go to lost and found for your hood.

35:29.500 --> 35:32.333
Next time, an alarm.
This morning was hairy.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.540
Any more fathers?

35:36.292 --> 35:38.408
Two fathers. Two separations.

35:38.583 --> 35:41.905
- Time for coffee?
- No, my piano's waiting and...

35:42.083 --> 35:43.539
It's always a bad time.

35:43.667 --> 35:46.454
I can't wait until Friday. It's impossible.

35:46.875 --> 35:48.661
3 kids shower in there.

35:49.625 --> 35:52.082
I could play upside down in the show.

35:52.292 --> 35:53.292
Yeah, right.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.206
I hate plumbers!

35:55.417 --> 35:58.784
Your skin is softer than mine.
That's very rare.

35:59.083 --> 36:03.031
I'm a 3-time European softskin champ.
I'm blown away.

36:03.417 --> 36:05.499
There's a level of softness...

36:06.625 --> 36:08.832
I won't put that in the show.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.157
It's Tuesday!

36:12.750 --> 36:14.581
Take a cart. Got money?

36:14.750 --> 36:17.241
- My credit card...
- You need coins.

36:18.417 --> 36:22.660
You get water, eggs, milk, and paté.
Meet you at yogurt.

36:23.250 --> 36:26.447
Eggs, milk, yogurt... and pate.

36:35.792 --> 36:36.907
Not finished?

36:38.417 --> 36:40.123
I took organic eggs...

36:40.333 --> 36:42.949
Put that back, please.

36:45.375 --> 36:47.286
Hold on, don't move...

36:47.792 --> 36:48.792
The milk...

36:52.458 --> 36:54.665
The milk I took is organic too.

36:54.833 --> 36:55.833
Four.

36:57.417 --> 36:58.417
Six.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.995
Think you'll have enough milk?

37:01.208 --> 37:02.208
No.

37:06.250 --> 37:08.411
One, two...

37:09.583 --> 37:10.698
Three, four.

37:10.958 --> 37:13.449
- Get the paté?
- Yeah I got paté.

37:14.208 --> 37:15.323
I got paté.

37:16.667 --> 37:17.702
Paté!

37:19.000 --> 37:20.115
Follow me.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.660
Anything missing?

37:25.708 --> 37:27.323
4 nice steaks?

37:27.583 --> 37:29.744
Hello, Marcel - your paté.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.037
- I set it aside.
- You can take this back.

37:33.208 --> 37:33.993
I get it.

37:34.125 --> 37:36.241
See you next week, Mrs. posche.

37:36.500 --> 37:37.831
Next week?

37:38.208 --> 37:41.041
Put that cart with the others.

37:41.792 --> 37:43.623
- Danone.
- Vanilla.

37:48.458 --> 37:49.914
You must buy this.

37:50.083 --> 37:51.994
- What is it?
- Tergoule de janville.

37:52.167 --> 37:54.954
God knows. Someone created
tergoule de janville.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.125
Just buy it.

37:56.292 --> 37:58.499
You can't buy it for the name.

37:58.708 --> 37:59.948
Yes, you can.

38:00.083 --> 38:02.825
Women get no pleasure in shopping.

38:03.042 --> 38:04.782
Pleasure in shopping?

38:05.125 --> 38:06.740
Spoken like a man!

38:08.792 --> 38:09.827
Mom?

38:10.042 --> 38:11.373
Hello, precious.

38:11.958 --> 38:14.665
It's 2. Get up. Let's change your sheets.

38:15.750 --> 38:17.160
I'm not alone.

38:17.458 --> 38:18.458
Really?

38:18.833 --> 38:20.573
Do I know her? Hello, miss.

38:20.750 --> 38:22.206
You're in the way.

38:22.417 --> 38:23.748
Grandma sent blintzes.

38:24.458 --> 38:25.698
Eat fruit.

38:25.833 --> 38:28.199
Leave it all. I'll manage. Love you.

38:30.625 --> 38:31.705
Hello, ma'am.

38:35.583 --> 38:36.868
Hello, miss.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.285
Charlotte...

38:43.500 --> 38:45.161
Mom, my mother...

38:48.000 --> 38:50.082
You know, madam... miss...

38:51.375 --> 38:54.788
My son is talented. His
father saw so at once.

38:54.917 --> 38:56.453
That's not garbage, mom.

38:58.625 --> 39:00.081
- Stop.
- I'l come back.

39:00.292 --> 39:03.034
I know you will but vacate the premises.

39:04.292 --> 39:05.577
I'm going.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.285
Love you too, precious.

39:09.458 --> 39:10.538
Love you too, mom.

39:11.917 --> 39:14.579
Your mother does your shopping and laundry?

39:15.083 --> 39:16.573
At your age?

39:16.750 --> 39:20.618
She's my mother. She loves me.
She enjoys it. So what?

39:40.458 --> 39:41.743
Righteous, good job.

39:42.292 --> 39:44.704
A sax piece for three dancers.

39:47.458 --> 39:49.699
- You here with me?
- I'm here.

39:49.958 --> 39:51.698
- You're not.
- 1 am.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.373
Righteous, you're absent.

39:54.542 --> 39:55.998
I don't know, I...

39:57.667 --> 39:59.498
I don't believe this.

39:59.708 --> 40:00.708
What?

40:01.167 --> 40:03.032
Please, not now.

40:04.833 --> 40:07.540
Who is she? Where did you dig her up?

40:09.208 --> 40:10.948
The old one!

40:16.167 --> 40:18.909
Tell me. Righteous, I'm getting horny.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.368
What's she like?

40:21.458 --> 40:22.664
What's she like?

40:27.042 --> 40:27.827
She's...

40:28.042 --> 40:29.042
Hot.

40:29.208 --> 40:30.208
Righteous.

40:30.583 --> 40:31.743
Righteous, dude!

40:32.292 --> 40:33.873
Stop saying "righteous".

40:34.042 --> 40:37.205
Me? "Righteous"? I do not say "righteous".

40:37.458 --> 40:39.369
- You do.
- Okay. Drop it.

40:39.875 --> 40:41.536
Not her. This one's 157?

40:43.250 --> 40:44.330
Is she shaved?

40:45.208 --> 40:46.698
She is so shaved!

40:47.875 --> 40:49.285
Okay... is she fat?

40:49.500 --> 40:51.036
Semi. Above, not below.

40:51.208 --> 40:54.075
Fat on one side, not the other.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.623
Is she bearded?

40:57.875 --> 40:59.240
Smelly crack?

41:01.708 --> 41:03.323
Alain posche's ex-wife.

41:11.917 --> 41:18.322
Chick poacher? Posche the poacher?

41:19.958 --> 41:21.243
Listen to me.

41:21.417 --> 41:22.782
- Listen, pal.
- You...

41:23.917 --> 41:24.917
Slept...

41:25.958 --> 41:27.073
With...

41:27.583 --> 41:28.583
The wife...

41:28.958 --> 41:30.038
Of god.

41:30.542 --> 41:31.542
It's...

41:31.667 --> 41:33.623
- Good idea.
- Listen, lolo...

41:35.083 --> 41:38.371
I mean, the eye-opener of the century.

41:40.250 --> 41:42.787
Something totally wild.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.994
You can never see her again.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.831
Never again.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.491
- It's over and done with.
- I know.

41:51.833 --> 41:54.870
It's not meant to last. And we have work.

41:55.083 --> 41:57.495
Lolo, come on! The show!

41:58.083 --> 41:59.664
We'll Ace the mogador.

41:59.833 --> 42:01.664
You burnt my hard drive.

42:01.875 --> 42:02.990
I can't work now.

42:03.292 --> 42:04.532
Let's go to Jules'.

42:05.833 --> 42:07.494
- Dressed like that?
- Yeah.

42:08.667 --> 42:11.158
Sos repair, ma'am. Need a man?

42:11.542 --> 42:12.827
How long do we have?

42:12.958 --> 42:13.958
Two and a half hours.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.206
I'll be 45 minutes, tops.

42:17.417 --> 42:20.909
- You bought out the store.
- The rest is behind me.

42:23.917 --> 42:25.498
You bought another sink?

42:27.250 --> 42:28.911
You're obviously not handy.

42:30.625 --> 42:34.117
Not attach the bottom part?
It'll leak all over!

42:35.000 --> 42:38.618
Okay, you have customers,
but I bought out the store.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.449
I can't believe that asshole hung up.

42:41.625 --> 42:45.072
I'll shove his 70-mm tube up his butt!

42:45.208 --> 42:45.947
Sacha.

42:46.208 --> 42:48.290
Meet Suzy and Louis.

42:48.458 --> 42:52.155
This is sacha.
A friend who came to fix the sink.

42:52.375 --> 42:53.375
Hello, sir.

42:55.583 --> 42:58.165
How many chimneys did you sweep today?

43:02.417 --> 43:04.874
It's a reference to Mary poppins.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.116
Chimneysweeps in stockings.

43:07.292 --> 43:09.749
- We had pantomime.
- Teacher was sick.

43:09.958 --> 43:12.825
So Nana brought you home, right?

43:13.250 --> 43:14.706
You do mime?

43:16.375 --> 43:18.036
Stay for lunch now.

43:18.917 --> 43:19.952
Yeah, sure.

43:20.833 --> 43:22.243
Sacha, lunchtime.

43:22.458 --> 43:23.458
Louis, come on.

43:23.583 --> 43:25.323
The plumber's joining us?

43:25.542 --> 43:27.373
He's a friend, not a plumber.

43:27.542 --> 43:31.581
- Why does he do plumbing?
- Because anyone can, sort of.

43:31.792 --> 43:33.828
Why not call a real plumber?

43:34.583 --> 43:36.494
Not a plumber! Not a plumber!

43:37.583 --> 43:39.073
Louis... lunch.

44:01.458 --> 44:03.619
So where did you two meet?

44:07.333 --> 44:09.745
Excuse me... I'm sorry.

44:16.708 --> 44:18.073
How did you do that?

44:21.667 --> 44:24.409
That happens whenever I fix stuff.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.911
It enters here and travels up.

44:28.667 --> 44:29.952
And comes out.

44:31.125 --> 44:32.285
Look.

44:35.958 --> 44:36.958
You okay?

44:37.375 --> 44:38.375
I threw up.

44:41.167 --> 44:42.873
I'll take care of it.

44:43.458 --> 44:44.573
You sure?

44:48.375 --> 44:49.490
He's fun.

45:02.917 --> 45:05.499
Trim 5 images from the music.

45:05.667 --> 45:07.032
From everything.

45:07.208 --> 45:08.539
And raise the voices.

45:08.708 --> 45:10.323
You guys are the best.

45:12.042 --> 45:16.285
3 kids! Righteous,
you dating a babe with 3 kids?

45:16.458 --> 45:18.744
Righteous, I could die laughing!

45:18.917 --> 45:21.408
It's like they're part of her.

45:21.583 --> 45:24.541
It's like... a given.
It's given me a headache.

45:24.708 --> 45:28.200
Because there's her... and them...

45:28.708 --> 45:31.905
But it's like they're her and she's them...

45:32.083 --> 45:33.323
In fact it's...

45:33.500 --> 45:35.582
Like in "aliens"... gross!

45:35.750 --> 45:37.536
Stop it, I know...

45:37.875 --> 45:39.240
We've tried breaking up

45:39.458 --> 45:42.746
and we're better than ever. What can I say?

45:42.917 --> 45:45.989
I'll explain how to ditch her.
Two movements.

45:46.583 --> 45:49.780
Call her to say you need a break. For work.

45:50.000 --> 45:51.661
Until after the mogador.

45:51.833 --> 45:54.074
By then we'll have dumped her.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.990
I understand, but I can't.

45:56.208 --> 45:57.823
We're bowling on Saturday.

45:57.958 --> 45:59.073
Who cares?

45:59.292 --> 46:02.034
I promised the kids. Now I have to go.

46:02.208 --> 46:03.744
Dammit, sacha!

46:03.917 --> 46:05.873
We have a week to finish.

46:06.042 --> 46:08.499
We have work. Righteous, you're no help!

46:08.708 --> 46:11.245
Enough with "righteous". It's a pain.

46:11.417 --> 46:12.748
I say what I want.

46:12.917 --> 46:16.489
Righteous, this is our dream.
We need to work nonstop.

46:16.625 --> 46:19.697
Righteous, you have one dream too many!

46:27.792 --> 46:29.032
I'll cancel bowling.

46:30.458 --> 46:32.915
The holes are too big. My fingers hurt!

46:33.333 --> 46:37.497
It's nothing. It'll come.
You have to find the... get it?

46:37.708 --> 46:39.414
Like this. See?

46:40.042 --> 46:42.704
Before the next ball... diet coke.

46:42.917 --> 46:44.407
I don't like soda.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.365
Iced tea.

46:49.417 --> 46:51.157
Peach iced tea.

46:52.208 --> 46:53.493
Peach, okay.

46:54.875 --> 46:57.207
I could use these kids as pins!

47:04.250 --> 47:05.330
This is bullshit.

47:05.500 --> 47:06.956
Why are you here?

47:07.292 --> 47:09.328
She wanted to see her.

47:09.500 --> 47:10.910
Grandma?

47:11.125 --> 47:13.992
Seriously, this is bullshit. You're pains.

47:14.167 --> 47:15.167
Iced tea?

47:17.208 --> 47:19.073
I'll get your ball. Come on.

47:20.542 --> 47:22.453
- Who's that?
- Grandma, for you.

47:22.625 --> 47:23.910
Your grandma?

47:28.667 --> 47:31.158
Hello, ma'am. Charlotte. My pleasure.

47:31.542 --> 47:33.203
The pleasure's all mine.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.411
I'm matz.

47:36.583 --> 47:37.583
Lionel.

47:37.917 --> 47:38.917
Laurent.

47:39.125 --> 47:40.240
The doctor.

47:40.583 --> 47:42.289
Director of the show.

47:46.208 --> 47:47.744
Zorro! Zorro!

47:49.958 --> 47:50.958
You crazy?

47:51.833 --> 47:53.664
My son. Cute?

47:54.375 --> 47:55.615
Cute as a button.

47:55.792 --> 47:57.077
That hurt.

48:00.375 --> 48:01.660
You okay?

48:02.458 --> 48:03.948
Are you Jewish?

48:04.333 --> 48:05.539
Excuse me.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.740
She's not Jewish?

48:08.125 --> 48:09.331
A little.

48:09.792 --> 48:11.908
You'll blow up the bowling alley.

48:12.500 --> 48:14.491
- Where are you?
- Get my message?

48:14.667 --> 48:18.239
What about the auction
I organized for your protégés?

48:18.542 --> 48:20.578
Remember? So come give

48:20.708 --> 48:23.370
the sales pitch to our investors.

48:23.542 --> 48:25.453
Unless you're too busy.

48:25.667 --> 48:26.702
And the kids?

48:27.375 --> 48:28.990
What do I do with them?

48:29.167 --> 48:31.283
Figure something out.

48:31.542 --> 48:34.249
Give 50 Euros to what's-her-name. Suzy.

48:34.417 --> 48:36.032
She can watch the boys.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.870
We eat in 10 minutes. Where are you?

48:47.667 --> 48:51.706
I forgot I have a dinner.
What do I do with the kids?

48:51.875 --> 48:53.456
Sacha can babysit.

48:53.667 --> 48:56.079
Seriously, he has nothing planned.

48:56.458 --> 48:57.698
Really? You can?

48:58.250 --> 49:00.741
Thanks so much. I'll tell the kids.

49:02.125 --> 49:04.582
I'll take care of everything.

49:06.583 --> 49:07.698
Pipsily...

49:08.250 --> 49:10.912
Tonight, when the kids are asleep,

49:11.083 --> 49:12.914
check if they're circumcised.

49:13.083 --> 49:15.074
No, grandma. Not a good idea.

49:32.625 --> 49:33.865
What now?

49:44.542 --> 49:46.157
No smoking here.

49:47.208 --> 49:48.414
You smoke?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.035
I don't smoke.

50:00.250 --> 50:01.330
Where is it?

50:03.292 --> 50:04.702
Tell us!

50:33.958 --> 50:36.165
Not a plumber! Not a plumber!

50:36.333 --> 50:37.333
Like this...

50:37.542 --> 50:40.454
- There's no water.
- Sure there is.

50:40.667 --> 50:42.032
Lousy plumber.

50:42.208 --> 50:44.449
I did a great job. Don't lean.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.741
Don't push too hard.

50:50.708 --> 50:52.289
Spit it out.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.912
Get down. That's dangerous.

50:57.375 --> 50:59.036
We're done brushing.

50:59.208 --> 51:02.325
Teeth fall out anyway. So forget teeth.

51:05.250 --> 51:06.490
Did you do that?

51:06.708 --> 51:09.620
My dad says we'll all live together soon.

51:11.458 --> 51:12.868
That's good, loulou.

51:13.500 --> 51:14.500
Goodnight.

51:22.083 --> 51:23.823
- Close the door.
- You sure?

51:24.917 --> 51:26.032
Night, kiddo.

51:34.917 --> 51:35.952
See?

51:36.583 --> 51:37.948
You never get tired?

51:42.667 --> 51:45.283
When I grow up, you'll be dead.

51:48.750 --> 51:49.990
It's not so sure.

51:50.125 --> 51:51.125
Maybe.

51:51.833 --> 51:54.825
Or when you grow up a lot lot lot lot.

51:57.083 --> 51:58.243
I don't like you.

51:59.417 --> 52:00.657
Me neither.

52:27.250 --> 52:28.786
He's rarely in Paris.

52:30.083 --> 52:32.699
He has his gym in cannes, his girlfriend.

52:32.917 --> 52:35.124
So we don't see much of each other.

52:36.250 --> 52:39.663
Once he was in Paris and
he didn't come see me.

52:41.125 --> 52:43.366
Alain is nice.

52:43.625 --> 52:44.364
Oh yeah?

52:44.542 --> 52:46.999
But he only calls for the boys.

52:47.583 --> 52:49.244
He never asks how I am.

52:49.708 --> 52:50.708
You see...

52:51.375 --> 52:52.911
Men are strange.

52:53.417 --> 52:55.032
We're not strange.

52:58.667 --> 52:59.827
A little.

53:00.250 --> 53:01.365
A little strange.

53:04.667 --> 53:06.077
What's your dad like?

53:08.417 --> 53:09.497
Great.

53:11.125 --> 53:13.662
But not anymore. He died when I was 10.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.331
It was a long time ago.

53:18.667 --> 53:20.123
Get some sleep now.

53:21.583 --> 53:22.743
I need to sleep too.

53:23.125 --> 53:24.331
Night, Sushi.

53:27.917 --> 53:28.917
Sleep well.

53:54.500 --> 53:55.660
How was it?

53:57.500 --> 53:58.580
Long.

54:00.708 --> 54:02.869
And you? Did you survive?

54:06.500 --> 54:08.991
Kids are so loveable when they sleep.

54:10.667 --> 54:12.874
And when the kittens are away...

55:30.833 --> 55:31.913
Good evening, sir.

55:34.375 --> 55:36.866
Alain. Sacha. A friend.

55:38.167 --> 55:39.623
Haven't we met?

55:41.500 --> 55:43.161
I was babysitting.

55:48.292 --> 55:49.702
That's not your job.

55:52.917 --> 55:54.202
Your scarf.

55:59.500 --> 56:00.831
Enjoy your evening.

56:05.875 --> 56:07.285
Well, that's done.

56:16.875 --> 56:18.081
He has the keys?

56:19.583 --> 56:21.915
No guys here. That's our deal.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.869
What deal?

56:26.667 --> 56:27.667
Tell me.

56:30.250 --> 56:31.706
Stop bothering me.

56:32.375 --> 56:33.990
- Tell me.
- Stop.

56:46.917 --> 56:49.033
I thought about you all night.

57:04.542 --> 57:06.328
There's too much light.

57:30.917 --> 57:32.953
Not "lolé". He said lolé.

57:33.958 --> 57:35.698
That's ridiculous, lolé!

57:36.792 --> 57:38.123
He said lolé!

58:26.042 --> 58:29.159
The three sides of the
triangle are identical.

58:29.417 --> 58:31.078
That's for equilaterals.

58:31.250 --> 58:33.161
It's the hypothalmus.

58:33.333 --> 58:36.200
Hypotenuse, okay. That's right.

58:36.375 --> 58:40.243
Who cares as long as
the sum of the angles equals 100?

58:40.958 --> 58:44.075
Math classes?
You barely graduated. I'm waiting.

58:44.250 --> 58:46.536
Start working. I'll be there soon.

58:46.792 --> 58:49.124
100 degrees is easy to remember.

58:49.292 --> 58:51.749
Water boils at 100 degrees.

58:51.917 --> 58:53.657
It's not 100. It's 180.

58:55.208 --> 58:57.119
I studied this yesterday.

58:57.708 --> 58:59.790
I remember like it was yesterday.

58:59.958 --> 59:01.869
- Yeah, right.
- What? Hey, xav.

59:02.042 --> 59:04.784
The "safe sex" ad is cancelled.

59:04.958 --> 59:07.370
They're changing music and composers.

59:07.708 --> 59:10.666
And they put the yogurt ad on standby.

59:11.125 --> 59:13.787
Keep me posted when things pick up.

59:16.583 --> 59:17.948
I can do this alone.

59:19.750 --> 59:22.913
I am a mathematical madman.

59:23.167 --> 59:24.623
Wild about arithmetic.

59:25.125 --> 59:27.081
Loco for geometry.

59:27.250 --> 59:29.616
It has to thaw out, then it'll flow.

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:28.493
It's beautiful.

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.912
I came to finish what
we started last night.

1:00:48.417 --> 1:00:51.705
If you're busy,
I can go to the supermarket first.

1:00:52.583 --> 1:00:55.370
I finished all my work.

1:01:04.917 --> 1:01:06.282
There is a god.

1:01:30.958 --> 1:01:34.906
Where is it? You know, we're in a rush.
Know why?

1:01:35.083 --> 1:01:38.325
We didn't work enough. Now you know why.

1:01:38.500 --> 1:01:40.036
Where's the last scene?

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.865
I forgot to print it out.

1:01:44.125 --> 1:01:46.332
You know... we're screwed.

1:01:47.375 --> 1:01:51.288
We'll never finish, you know.
You'll never be done, you know.

1:01:51.458 --> 1:01:53.164
No more saying "you know"!

1:01:53.375 --> 1:01:54.660
- Lolo!
- What?

1:01:54.833 --> 1:01:57.370
Sleep. You're presenting it tomorrow.

1:01:57.542 --> 1:01:59.328
- We'll finish.
- I'll sleep.

1:01:59.542 --> 1:02:01.373
I'll take your computer.

1:02:01.542 --> 1:02:03.373
I'll be ready. I know it.

1:02:03.792 --> 1:02:06.158
I need to stop sleeping. No, talking.

1:02:06.333 --> 1:02:08.415
And go to talk. No, to sleep.

1:02:08.583 --> 1:02:11.290
I need to stop talking, stop talking...

1:02:14.208 --> 1:02:16.699
I just walked in front of a mirror.

1:02:17.208 --> 1:02:19.950
For the first time I wanted to look twice.

1:02:21.542 --> 1:02:24.079
- Must be the new suit, right?
- A suit!

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:25.250
Where are you?

1:02:25.375 --> 1:02:28.242
On my way home. I have
an appointment nearby.

1:02:28.417 --> 1:02:30.533
- I'll come by.
- No, you'll be late.

1:02:30.750 --> 1:02:33.082
I have a present for Leo.

1:02:33.250 --> 1:02:34.831
- Cool.
- See you.

1:02:36.333 --> 1:02:38.039
Press here for Zorro.

1:02:38.375 --> 1:02:39.956
Mr. plumber, lunch?

1:02:40.167 --> 1:02:42.078
I have to run. Hold on!

1:02:43.042 --> 1:02:45.408
Look. If I last 10 seconds...

1:02:45.875 --> 1:02:47.740
It'll be a big hit.

1:02:57.083 --> 1:02:58.163
I threw up.

1:03:03.917 --> 1:03:04.622
I'm sick.

1:03:04.792 --> 1:03:06.248
Why did you do that?

1:03:08.792 --> 1:03:10.032
Why did you do it?

1:03:11.792 --> 1:03:13.248
Is it okay?

1:03:20.042 --> 1:03:21.907
Finally! Off we go!

1:03:22.083 --> 1:03:23.163
My keys.

1:03:25.542 --> 1:03:27.373
Where did you put my car keys?

1:03:27.542 --> 1:03:29.078
I don't like you!

1:03:29.208 --> 1:03:30.243
You...

1:03:30.583 --> 1:03:31.583
Listen to me.

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:35.743
My goddamn car keys! It's important!

1:03:39.167 --> 1:03:41.704
Sorry, I'm in a rush.

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:44.198
- The Porsche?
- At the office.

1:03:44.417 --> 1:03:45.702
Leo, it's important.

1:03:45.875 --> 1:03:50.039
Where are the keys you took
instead of these? It's serious.

1:03:50.208 --> 1:03:51.448
Where are my keys?

1:03:51.667 --> 1:03:54.739
He has food aversions. He's little.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.285
Little, yeah.

1:03:57.708 --> 1:03:59.164
I'm little too.

1:04:04.583 --> 1:04:05.789
He took the scooter!

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.824
This is the end of scene 4.
There will be colored bubbles...

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:14.826
Then we move into his
turkish march... okay?

1:04:15.958 --> 1:04:18.074
Here I'll have a backdrop

1:04:18.208 --> 1:04:22.247
with dancers behind it who intermingle.

1:04:22.542 --> 1:04:23.998
They blend together.

1:04:27.292 --> 1:04:29.533
Once again, I have an animatic...

1:04:30.167 --> 1:04:33.159
I can show you once the computer gets here.

1:04:34.208 --> 1:04:35.288
Here he is.

1:04:37.667 --> 1:04:38.747
I'm sorry.

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:40.333
No taxis...

1:04:40.708 --> 1:04:42.619
Scooter, then a bus...

1:04:44.417 --> 1:04:46.203
And the subway strike...

1:04:46.917 --> 1:04:50.159
It's been in the news all week.
Let's start over.

1:04:50.333 --> 1:04:52.415
With... without the animatic.

1:04:52.542 --> 1:04:53.998
And the partitions?

1:04:55.667 --> 1:04:57.328
In my head.

1:05:00.250 --> 1:05:01.365
Scene 7.

1:05:02.750 --> 1:05:05.457
He'll start with his turkish march.

1:05:20.542 --> 1:05:21.542
It's hot.

1:05:33.708 --> 1:05:36.120
Does anyone have a kleenex?

1:05:36.583 --> 1:05:37.823
It's slippery.

1:05:46.167 --> 1:05:47.327
My car keys.

1:05:47.625 --> 1:05:48.625
What is it?

1:05:49.458 --> 1:05:51.198
My car keys.

1:05:51.375 --> 1:05:52.865
I had them.

1:05:53.583 --> 1:05:55.448
- In my pocket.
- Enough.

1:06:14.250 --> 1:06:16.582
I've done all I can, sacha Keller.

1:06:17.042 --> 1:06:19.408
Since your dad died, you're scared.

1:06:20.042 --> 1:06:21.782
Shitting bricks for 25 years!

1:06:21.958 --> 1:06:23.698
Can't work, can't commit.

1:06:23.958 --> 1:06:26.665
You're scared you don't
measure up, but I...

1:06:27.167 --> 1:06:28.373
I can't fight alone.

1:06:28.500 --> 1:06:30.912
- Only one sacha Keller.
- Stop with your dad.

1:06:31.083 --> 1:06:34.246
Jules' tonight.
You better come, because tonight...

1:06:34.458 --> 1:06:35.458
I need to fuck.

1:06:58.667 --> 1:07:00.328
"Righteous" didn't tell you.

1:07:00.542 --> 1:07:04.660
He gave your name to two ad agencies.
You're blacklisted.

1:07:06.375 --> 1:07:07.706
What'll you do?

1:07:08.958 --> 1:07:10.914
I have no idea.

1:07:11.375 --> 1:07:14.242
Come play or we'll lose them, honest.

1:07:17.208 --> 1:07:18.573
I'm talking to you.

1:07:19.125 --> 1:07:20.125
What is it?

1:07:20.375 --> 1:07:22.866
What two agencies won't work with me?

1:07:26.292 --> 1:07:28.328
Bdb... and publican.

1:07:30.083 --> 1:07:33.246
Honest, every agency in Paris
works with posche.

1:07:37.125 --> 1:07:38.240
Listen up.

1:07:38.792 --> 1:07:39.827
That girl...

1:07:43.167 --> 1:07:44.327
She's history.

1:08:01.583 --> 1:08:03.289
Alcohol... capital I!

1:08:03.458 --> 1:08:05.198
Sex! With a capital x!

1:08:13.125 --> 1:08:15.457
- It's my fault.
- Why are you here?

1:08:15.875 --> 1:08:18.582
If Leo hadn't puked, you'd have been fine.

1:08:18.750 --> 1:08:19.750
And the kids?

1:08:20.083 --> 1:08:21.118
They're asleep.

1:08:21.750 --> 1:08:22.865
I had to see you.

1:08:36.875 --> 1:08:38.911
It's unesco in here!

1:08:50.958 --> 1:08:52.323
Big deep shit.

1:08:56.125 --> 1:08:57.956
It's nothing.

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:00.664
Nothing at all.

1:09:03.625 --> 1:09:05.991
Your ex blacklisted me all over.

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.285
Morning, Mrs. posche.

1:09:35.875 --> 1:09:38.457
It's not my fault he's untalented.

1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:42.413
Seriously, how do you think
I could stoop so low?

1:09:42.750 --> 1:09:44.661
Leave him alone now.

1:09:45.250 --> 1:09:46.615
And you know what?

1:09:47.167 --> 1:09:50.455
We've been separated for 2 years.
Time to divorce.

1:10:02.375 --> 1:10:05.572
You know my lawyers. You
can't have the boys.

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:09.996
I don't want them to be raised by a loser.

1:10:10.167 --> 1:10:11.373
You can't do that.

1:10:11.542 --> 1:10:12.827
Think it over.

1:10:13.375 --> 1:10:14.831
We're not that bad off.

1:10:15.333 --> 1:10:16.743
The apartment, the boys...

1:10:17.625 --> 1:10:20.367
My money lets your pitiful artists survive.

1:10:20.958 --> 1:10:22.198
We love each other.

1:10:23.958 --> 1:10:25.289
What are you lacking?

1:10:26.667 --> 1:10:29.534
I helped you grow with my pitiful artists.

1:10:31.708 --> 1:10:34.120
You taught me about art and beauty.

1:10:34.500 --> 1:10:36.206
I made a modern woman of you.

1:10:36.708 --> 1:10:38.039
A trophy wife.

1:10:38.708 --> 1:10:41.996
Locked in a vault, taken out for shows.

1:10:45.542 --> 1:10:47.578
You can't take a step without me.

1:10:47.792 --> 1:10:49.453
Stop acting silly.

1:10:50.250 --> 1:10:51.365
Careful, Charlotte.

1:10:51.875 --> 1:10:53.365
If you leave here...

1:10:54.083 --> 1:10:55.368
It's over, Alain.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:10:58.240
You no longer scare me.

1:11:57.042 --> 1:12:00.580
It's Suzy. My leg is bleeding bad!
I can't find mom.

1:12:00.750 --> 1:12:02.661
Nana's out with the boys.

1:12:02.833 --> 1:12:04.949
I didn't do it on purpose.

1:12:05.125 --> 1:12:06.956
Calm down. Where are you?

1:12:07.083 --> 1:12:09.199
Home. My bedroom mirror broke.

1:12:09.375 --> 1:12:12.242
There's something white in my leg.
I'm scared.

1:12:14.333 --> 1:12:16.415
- 10 minutes.
- Thanks, Sushi.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:19.500
Yes?

1:12:19.667 --> 1:12:23.080
I'm meeting with Jean-Claude
for the soundtrack.

1:12:23.292 --> 1:12:25.408
I'm taking my daughter to hospital.

1:12:25.583 --> 1:12:26.868
I'll be 2 hours late.

1:12:27.042 --> 1:12:28.828
No, he's off to London.

1:12:31.833 --> 1:12:33.949
- She's not out?
- Not yet.

1:12:54.750 --> 1:12:55.750
Thanks.

1:12:57.375 --> 1:12:58.490
It's normal.

1:13:00.042 --> 1:13:01.828
What an asshole! A butcher!

1:13:02.875 --> 1:13:05.116
He amputated just for that?

1:13:05.917 --> 1:13:07.498
I want him out of here.

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:11.625
Lionel!

1:13:11.667 --> 1:13:15.330
It's nothing. She's fine. A minor accident!

1:13:15.750 --> 1:13:18.036
Artery and tendon both untouched.

1:13:24.958 --> 1:13:26.494
You can put me down.

1:13:29.833 --> 1:13:32.119
I can blow screws from my nose!

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:34.366
In the ear and out the nose.

1:13:34.500 --> 1:13:37.207
- That's how?
- Exactly. In and out.

1:13:37.375 --> 1:13:38.205
I get it!

1:13:38.375 --> 1:13:40.161
Zorro! Bob the builder!

1:13:40.667 --> 1:13:43.739
Leave him alone. Sacha has to go to work.

1:13:43.875 --> 1:13:45.411
He has to fix Suzy's bed.

1:13:45.583 --> 1:13:47.699
- Please...
- Let's do it.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:49.536
- Who's he?
- Bob.

1:13:49.917 --> 1:13:51.873
Bob the builder. It's you.

1:13:52.125 --> 1:13:54.081
You just have to wedge it in.

1:13:54.583 --> 1:13:56.244
That's how it works.

1:13:56.583 --> 1:13:58.448
Now it'll hold. Perfect.

1:13:58.667 --> 1:13:59.827
There's no need.

1:14:00.417 --> 1:14:02.624
It's nothing. It'll be a minute.

1:14:09.292 --> 1:14:11.533
Don't put too much weight on it.

1:14:13.417 --> 1:14:15.123
Fixing is a state of mind.

1:14:18.292 --> 1:14:19.828
Fucking goddamned...

1:14:21.542 --> 1:14:23.282
Bad quality.

1:14:25.042 --> 1:14:27.533
I'll remove it. It'll be easier.

1:14:27.958 --> 1:14:29.038
It'll be better.

1:14:32.708 --> 1:14:33.948
You okay, Sushi?

1:14:35.875 --> 1:14:36.875
Fine.

1:14:37.208 --> 1:14:39.449
Get a vacuum. And some posters.

1:14:39.833 --> 1:14:41.323
Lots of posters.

1:14:41.875 --> 1:14:42.990
You suck!

1:14:50.042 --> 1:14:51.042
So long.

1:14:58.958 --> 1:15:02.405
Without you, I can't play...

1:18:47.333 --> 1:18:48.618
You scared me.

1:18:49.250 --> 1:18:50.615
Been here long?

1:18:54.083 --> 1:18:55.083
You wrote that?

1:18:57.667 --> 1:18:59.749
I love it, I swear.

1:19:01.042 --> 1:19:03.454
I'm not done. It needs a refrain.

1:19:03.792 --> 1:19:04.998
You really like it?

1:19:05.167 --> 1:19:06.532
Goosebumps.

1:19:07.417 --> 1:19:10.784
I'll do it. I'm working on lyrics too.

1:19:11.083 --> 1:19:12.289
Something like this.

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:06.285
You found yourself.

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:08.035
I swear.

1:20:09.333 --> 1:20:12.496
It may fit in the final scene.
The levitation.

1:20:12.667 --> 1:20:13.782
At the end.

1:20:14.542 --> 1:20:17.500
- We'll test it in New York.
- Meaning?

1:20:18.667 --> 1:20:21.124
At the theater. On Broadway.

1:20:24.875 --> 1:20:26.331
Are you kidding?

1:20:26.500 --> 1:20:27.500
I swear.

1:20:28.083 --> 1:20:32.452
I swear. They loved the mock-ups,
the look, everything, I swear.

1:20:32.917 --> 1:20:34.453
They want it all, I swear!

1:20:34.625 --> 1:20:37.367
It's "I swear" now? You say "I swear".

1:20:37.542 --> 1:20:40.204
Please, I'm seeing a speech therapist.

1:20:40.417 --> 1:20:42.248
How did you pull this off?

1:20:43.750 --> 1:20:46.412
The theater belongs to some Canadians.

1:20:46.750 --> 1:20:48.490
Canadians from Canada.

1:20:49.417 --> 1:20:52.079
There's a show that got cancelled.

1:20:52.542 --> 1:20:55.329
We have 12 weeks just for us. 12 weeks.

1:20:57.708 --> 1:20:58.823
In New York?

1:21:00.750 --> 1:21:01.750
Broadway.

1:21:16.583 --> 1:21:18.073
We see them next week.

1:21:18.250 --> 1:21:22.072
If they like it, we cast, rehearse.
I swear, we take off.

1:21:26.958 --> 1:21:29.040
We have to spend 6 months there.

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:37.457
Nothing or no one is keeping you here.

1:21:38.458 --> 1:21:39.868
Don't you agree?

1:21:45.292 --> 1:21:47.749
This is the chance of a lifetime!

1:22:15.125 --> 1:22:18.367
I want to go tell her I
can't live without her.

1:22:19.042 --> 1:22:20.077
You know, pipsily,

1:22:20.250 --> 1:22:22.366
work is important.

1:22:22.542 --> 1:22:24.874
Remember what choki used to say.

1:22:25.083 --> 1:22:26.994
"Sugar serves no purpose

1:22:27.167 --> 1:22:29.374
when you're out of salt."

1:22:29.917 --> 1:22:33.705
Life without her
has no sugar, salt, pepper: Nothing.

1:22:34.042 --> 1:22:35.373
I want to live with her.

1:22:35.542 --> 1:22:37.999
Move to the south, rent a place...

1:22:38.250 --> 1:22:40.741
With the kids I can give piano lessons.

1:22:41.250 --> 1:22:43.081
If you leave, I'll die.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:44.869
No, or else the suburbs.

1:22:45.333 --> 1:22:47.415
The suburbs. It's not far.

1:22:47.792 --> 1:22:48.622
I'll be here.

1:22:48.792 --> 1:22:50.453
Don't talk nonsense.

1:22:50.708 --> 1:22:52.744
You're an artist.

1:22:53.292 --> 1:22:55.908
Start with a musical in America.

1:22:56.083 --> 1:22:58.449
Find a nice Jewish girl.

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:00.740
No kids, in New York.

1:23:00.875 --> 1:23:02.786
And bring her back!

1:23:03.708 --> 1:23:04.708
Gin!

1:23:06.583 --> 1:23:08.448
You know what she does at night?

1:23:09.417 --> 1:23:10.702
She plays piano.

1:23:11.042 --> 1:23:12.248
With the kids.

1:23:12.708 --> 1:23:14.164
And they sing together.

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:16.991
Like in a frank capra movie.

1:23:17.875 --> 1:23:19.035
Exactly.

1:23:21.042 --> 1:23:24.239
Like in the movies we
used to watch with choki.

1:23:32.042 --> 1:23:33.907
She's the one, isn't she?

1:23:34.625 --> 1:23:35.910
Pipsily...

1:23:36.500 --> 1:23:37.500
Yes.

1:23:38.500 --> 1:23:39.660
She's the one.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.116
42 bonus points.

1:23:47.792 --> 1:23:50.989
You owe me 8 packs of...

1:23:51.167 --> 1:23:52.167
Camels.

1:23:56.208 --> 1:23:58.244
Choose your suburb right.

1:23:58.583 --> 1:24:00.539
Don't make me take a train

1:24:00.708 --> 1:24:02.790
that heads to the east.

1:24:06.292 --> 1:24:07.407
Your own gallery?

1:24:07.542 --> 1:24:10.158
I'm in it 50/50 with a German art dealer.

1:24:10.333 --> 1:24:12.619
He brings the money, me the talent.

1:24:13.333 --> 1:24:14.333
Great news.

1:24:14.417 --> 1:24:16.999
I pay the rent. And no salary, yet.

1:24:17.417 --> 1:24:19.783
- When do you start?
- Right away.

1:24:19.958 --> 1:24:23.121
I'm training my successor
at the foundation.

1:24:23.292 --> 1:24:26.534
And then I'll move, change
the kids' schools...

1:24:28.083 --> 1:24:30.415
I have no choice, but I'm not scared.

1:24:32.583 --> 1:24:33.823
My chacha!

1:24:41.042 --> 1:24:42.703
I can't forget him.

1:24:43.333 --> 1:24:44.413
I miss him.

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:49.750
It's him.

1:24:51.833 --> 1:24:53.164
He wants to see me.

1:24:57.208 --> 1:24:58.208
I'm going.

1:24:59.333 --> 1:25:00.664
Go on, chacha!

1:25:01.042 --> 1:25:03.249
Go for it!

1:25:13.792 --> 1:25:14.998
Life is wonderful!

1:25:15.542 --> 1:25:17.248
You can sleep here tonight.

1:25:23.167 --> 1:25:25.579
Everybody in bed at 8:30.

1:25:25.750 --> 1:25:26.990
No problem, ma'am.

1:25:27.708 --> 1:25:28.868
Man behind you.

1:25:55.458 --> 1:25:56.743
I love you.

1:26:00.833 --> 1:26:02.994
I want to spend my life with you.

1:26:03.583 --> 1:26:04.868
With your children.

1:26:12.542 --> 1:26:14.078
I'm sorry, sacha.

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:16.535
I can't.

1:26:23.958 --> 1:26:25.243
Can't what?

1:26:25.708 --> 1:26:26.708
Everything.

1:26:27.167 --> 1:26:30.659
Clash with Alain, possibly lose custody.

1:26:30.875 --> 1:26:32.536
Change my lifestyle.

1:26:36.500 --> 1:26:38.411
Don't act so surprised.

1:26:38.542 --> 1:26:39.542
I'm not acting.

1:26:40.167 --> 1:26:41.828
You and I met too late.

1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:43.706
I want to live with you.

1:26:43.875 --> 1:26:46.082
You can't take on a woman like me.

1:26:55.708 --> 1:26:57.289
I'm back with Alain.

1:27:02.208 --> 1:27:03.448
Go away now.

1:27:07.542 --> 1:27:08.542
Go.

1:28:28.750 --> 1:28:30.331
Can I sleep with you?

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:31.865
Come on, honey.

1:28:38.875 --> 1:28:40.081
Men...

1:29:43.375 --> 1:29:45.616
After you... I insist.

1:29:45.792 --> 1:29:46.792
You first.

1:29:57.083 --> 1:29:58.448
Isn't this amazing?

1:30:00.208 --> 1:30:02.449
Hold on. Now it's my turn.

1:30:15.167 --> 1:30:16.202
I'm hot.

1:30:16.917 --> 1:30:18.373
You bet you are.

1:30:32.625 --> 1:30:36.994
Let's go.

1:30:37.417 --> 1:30:38.417
Can we start?

1:30:38.667 --> 1:30:39.827
Let's rehearse.

1:31:50.292 --> 1:31:51.532
Stop here.

1:31:52.042 --> 1:31:55.739
For the second scene,
we need 4 more dancers.

1:31:55.875 --> 1:31:57.240
I'd prefer that.

1:31:57.417 --> 1:32:00.909
Sacha, that was good, but...

1:32:07.833 --> 1:32:10.199
There are things you can't refuse.

1:32:10.417 --> 1:32:14.160
Broadway theater, Canadian production,
the whole shebang.

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.831
You should check, anyway.

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.412
Come on, Alain would never do that.

1:32:20.792 --> 1:32:22.874
Men are ruthless with rivals.

1:32:23.208 --> 1:32:24.208
Hold on...

1:32:24.333 --> 1:32:25.994
What are you not saying?

1:32:26.667 --> 1:32:28.749
Did you want me after I left?

1:32:29.417 --> 1:32:31.248
When I left, it was over.

1:32:31.417 --> 1:32:32.953
Over and done with.

1:32:35.583 --> 1:32:38.120
Alain still bought me the gym in cannes.

1:32:43.708 --> 1:32:45.198
You let him buy you?

1:32:47.542 --> 1:32:48.827
He smooth-talked me.

1:32:48.917 --> 1:32:52.330
But it was over.
I've been ashamed for 10 years.

1:32:52.458 --> 1:32:53.664
You let him buy you!

1:32:53.792 --> 1:32:57.455
And you never let him buy you?
Are you Lily white?

1:32:57.542 --> 1:32:59.328
Don't yell at women, jerk!

1:32:59.417 --> 1:33:00.417
Me?

1:33:01.083 --> 1:33:02.163
Hey you!

1:33:02.458 --> 1:33:03.493
Who's a jerk?

1:33:04.875 --> 1:33:06.706
Who's the jerk?

1:33:06.833 --> 1:33:08.619
The one who can't stand up

1:33:08.875 --> 1:33:10.615
because he has no balls!

1:33:10.792 --> 1:33:13.204
Want to stand up? Never!

1:33:13.292 --> 1:33:15.123
Because you're a jerk!

1:33:15.250 --> 1:33:16.250
What happened?

1:33:16.292 --> 1:33:17.452
He's your father.

1:34:16.417 --> 1:34:19.705
Alain asked me to follow up on the musical.

1:34:20.250 --> 1:34:22.707
Yes, art is my albatross.

1:34:24.042 --> 1:34:25.157
A downpayment?

1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.992
135,000? From his personal account...

1:34:30.167 --> 1:34:32.579
Of course, from the foundation.

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:37.707
But New York isn't French-speaking.

1:34:39.000 --> 1:34:40.410
Via Canada.

1:34:41.042 --> 1:34:44.284
That's right. We'd discussed that...

1:34:47.583 --> 1:34:50.120
Thank you. Goodbye, Mr. Saint-hilaire.

1:35:32.333 --> 1:35:33.493
It's Christmas!

1:35:42.083 --> 1:35:45.780
This will cost you a fortune.
Love you, grandma.

1:35:46.083 --> 1:35:48.074
She calls every Friday night

1:35:48.250 --> 1:35:50.662
and yells because I answer on shabbat.

1:35:56.167 --> 1:35:59.534
See this place? Isn't
this "American-style"?

1:35:59.708 --> 1:36:01.619
Not bad at all...

1:36:01.792 --> 1:36:03.157
Give me your phone.

1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:09.582
- What are you doing?
- Removing my contact.

1:36:11.917 --> 1:36:13.532
We saw Charlotte.

1:36:14.250 --> 1:36:17.413
Does sacha know that her
ex is financing this?

1:36:19.833 --> 1:36:21.323
What's the difference?

1:36:21.958 --> 1:36:24.700
Her first husband already sold out.

1:36:24.875 --> 1:36:28.117
She can't sleep and I
promised I'd find out.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000
So?

1:36:38.542 --> 1:36:39.542
He has no idea.

1:36:42.792 --> 1:36:43.792
Piece of shit.

1:36:46.375 --> 1:36:47.615
What's up?

1:36:51.458 --> 1:36:53.414
All sweaty and not dancing.

1:36:54.083 --> 1:36:55.744
I'm a total asshole.

1:36:58.250 --> 1:36:59.786
I'm a lousy friend.

1:37:00.792 --> 1:37:02.783
Jean-seb, take over directing.

1:37:03.583 --> 1:37:05.119
I'm sorry. I quit.

1:37:07.875 --> 1:37:08.705
Hold on.

1:37:08.833 --> 1:37:11.290
Let's go have a little talk.

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:15.536
- What is it?
- He'll explain.

1:37:18.625 --> 1:37:19.705
Hold on...

1:37:19.875 --> 1:37:21.365
He paid...

1:37:21.958 --> 1:37:23.664
So I'd leave the country?

1:37:24.125 --> 1:37:25.615
Just a down payment.

1:37:25.833 --> 1:37:29.030
The pouch likes to party, but he's stingy.

1:37:29.208 --> 1:37:30.288
The pouch?

1:37:33.958 --> 1:37:37.030
The pouch is the skin
that protects the balls.

1:37:37.792 --> 1:37:38.907
The pouch.

1:37:40.750 --> 1:37:43.662
He asked me to his office.
He wanted to help.

1:37:43.833 --> 1:37:46.745
He knew a Canadian with Broadway theater.

1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:49.831
Posche was willing to invest.

1:37:50.208 --> 1:37:52.244
Without anyone knowing.

1:37:52.500 --> 1:37:56.072
I'll call the pouch and I'll pay him back.

1:37:57.417 --> 1:37:58.623
Makes no difference.

1:37:58.792 --> 1:38:00.532
Yes it does.

1:38:02.250 --> 1:38:04.536
I saw Charlotte behind your back.

1:38:05.083 --> 1:38:07.119
To persuade her to let you leave.

1:38:13.417 --> 1:38:14.748
You did that?

1:38:17.542 --> 1:38:20.249
- I didn't know you loved her so.
- She loves me.

1:38:20.375 --> 1:38:21.660
I had no idea.

1:38:23.083 --> 1:38:24.118
She loves me.

1:38:28.958 --> 1:38:30.289
You love each other.

1:38:30.458 --> 1:38:31.458
How dumb of me.

1:38:31.583 --> 1:38:33.699
There's a flight at 10:45.

1:38:33.875 --> 1:38:36.867
It's always empty. You can still make it.

1:38:37.042 --> 1:38:38.703
Don't toss in the towel.

1:38:39.542 --> 1:38:41.828
You have 5 days. Come back smiling.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:43.160
I swear...

1:38:44.917 --> 1:38:49.616
Life is the only show
that merits a front-row seat.

1:38:49.833 --> 1:38:50.993
Move your ass!

1:38:52.625 --> 1:38:53.785
Hurry!

1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:55.115
I love you.

1:38:59.917 --> 1:39:01.282
Go on, rocky!

1:39:01.458 --> 1:39:03.323
Run, forest!

1:39:08.042 --> 1:39:09.998
Sir! Sir! He's in a meeting!

1:39:13.167 --> 1:39:14.282
Beautiful...

1:39:15.458 --> 1:39:17.665
Sorry to interrupt, gentlemen.

1:39:18.417 --> 1:39:19.417
Alain...

1:39:19.750 --> 1:39:23.493
I came to thank you.
I'm taking Charlotte to New York.

1:39:23.708 --> 1:39:26.199
To show her how the show is evolving.

1:39:27.083 --> 1:39:29.165
It's really going well. Thanks.

1:39:29.375 --> 1:39:32.742
Can you babysit? If not,
I'll take the kids.

1:39:32.875 --> 1:39:35.742
New York is great for kids. Keep me posted.

1:39:35.917 --> 1:39:37.873
Gentlemen, thank you...

1:39:41.708 --> 1:39:42.708
Xav?

1:39:43.167 --> 1:39:44.167
What's up?

1:39:44.417 --> 1:39:45.827
Nice-looking tie.

1:39:52.500 --> 1:39:53.500
Sir...

1:40:01.167 --> 1:40:03.078
Who do you think you are?

1:40:05.542 --> 1:40:08.079
A man who won't ever let her go.

1:40:08.292 --> 1:40:09.292
Never.

1:40:10.792 --> 1:40:12.703
You don't know what I can do.

1:40:12.833 --> 1:40:13.833
I do.

1:40:13.875 --> 1:40:15.786
I got a glimpse of it.

1:40:18.333 --> 1:40:19.413
But beware.

1:40:20.250 --> 1:40:23.913
Edgar in the aristocats ends up
getting sent to timbuktu.

1:40:26.042 --> 1:40:29.534
I didn't like the other one,
but with you it's hate.

1:40:37.208 --> 1:40:40.371
I can't really love your kids
if we're at war.

1:40:49.500 --> 1:40:50.785
Despite...

1:40:52.333 --> 1:40:53.823
Appearances...

1:40:57.958 --> 1:41:01.121
My sons and their mother are my life.

1:41:02.667 --> 1:41:03.702
So...

1:41:08.167 --> 1:41:10.158
I hope you'll measure up.

1:41:18.667 --> 1:41:20.453
So we won't hate each other.

1:41:23.625 --> 1:41:24.625
We will.

1:41:44.542 --> 1:41:46.533
- Hello, Mr. posche.
- Fired.

1:42:09.125 --> 1:42:10.956
- It's pretty far.
- Where?

1:42:11.125 --> 1:42:14.162
Middle of nowhere.
Romainville, the suburbs.

1:42:14.708 --> 1:42:15.708
Good luck.

1:42:57.292 --> 1:42:58.327
Sushi!

1:42:58.542 --> 1:43:00.533
Mom! Sushi's back!

1:43:20.750 --> 1:43:23.583
We're done today. See you tomorrow.

1:43:23.708 --> 1:43:24.708
No problem.

1:44:20.958 --> 1:44:22.698
Grandma's piano!

1:44:25.292 --> 1:44:28.580
Not enough room for two
pianos in this house.
