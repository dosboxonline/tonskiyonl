WEBVTT

00:19.600 --> 00:22.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
the couple will now exchange vows.

00:24.480 --> 00:30.840
Lucas Duvivier, do you take Élodie Fabergé
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

00:32.880 --> 00:35.400
-Don't worry, honey. He can still say no.
-Stop.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.320
I do!

00:41.800 --> 00:43.000
Perfect.

00:43.080 --> 00:44.120
They're so cute.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.160
Excellent.

00:45.800 --> 00:50.240
And do you, Élodie Fabergé,
take Lucas Duvivier

00:50.320 --> 00:52.800
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

00:54.240 --> 00:55.840
-Fuck's sake.
-Unbelievable.

00:56.440 --> 00:57.360
Sorry.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.320
I'd like to remind everyone

00:59.400 --> 01:03.320
that cell phones must be
switched to wedding mode.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.800
-Thank you…
-Wedding mode!

01:04.880 --> 01:05.840
As I was saying,

01:05.920 --> 01:10.080
Élodie Fabergé,
do you take Lucas Duvivier--

01:10.160 --> 01:12.280
Come on. That's enough!

01:13.120 --> 01:14.680
Oh, no! Come on!

01:15.400 --> 01:17.240
-It's Damien.
-What?

01:17.320 --> 01:20.720
I'll start again.
Do you, Élodie Fabergé, take--

01:20.800 --> 01:21.800
This is ridiculous.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.640
Who is it?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.120
One of her friends.

01:26.960 --> 01:29.560
Quit it! We're at a wedding.
We can't answer!

01:29.640 --> 01:31.040
That's enough now.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.920
All right. Calm down.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.840
Élodie, apparently, it can't wait.

01:36.920 --> 01:37.960
Huh?

01:40.480 --> 01:41.680
Pass it to her.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.440
Answer, quickly.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.880
Élodie, what are you doing?
You can't answer!

01:50.160 --> 01:52.720
I'm sorry. I won't be long, okay?

01:54.360 --> 01:55.400
Hello?

01:55.480 --> 01:57.120
-What's going on?
-Unbelievable.

01:57.800 --> 02:00.120
-An emergency, I think.
-What is so urgent?

02:00.200 --> 02:01.760
-An emergency?
-But…

02:02.960 --> 02:06.280
Yes, you're out of your mind.
I can't. I'm at my wedding.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.360
-Why tell me this today?
-Who is it?

02:11.440 --> 02:13.160
Of course I remember Capri.

02:13.240 --> 02:15.240
-What?
-How could I forget?

02:15.760 --> 02:18.200
I've never felt that way about anyone.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.640
-Who is it?
-Her ex.

02:20.720 --> 02:22.120
-What?
-Her ex?

02:22.200 --> 02:25.000
Darling, that's enough. Hang up now, okay?

02:25.080 --> 02:27.680
Miss, please.
Everyone is waiting for your answer.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.240
Do you take him or not?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.880
-Yes, of course.
-There, she said, "Yes."

02:31.960 --> 02:34.200
-So, you do?
-No! No…

02:34.880 --> 02:37.480
By saying "Yes" to you, I said "No." See?

02:37.560 --> 02:41.400
So, just to be clear.
When you say "Yes", you mean "No"?

02:41.480 --> 02:44.120
No way! I thought you were in Australia.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.040
Miss! Does yes mean no?

02:47.880 --> 02:48.960
Maybe, yes.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.320
I'm a bit lost.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.600
-She said what to whom?
-No idea.

02:52.680 --> 02:53.880
-So, no.
-Is it yes?

02:53.960 --> 02:55.560
I'm sorry, Lucas. I…

02:56.720 --> 02:57.560
I can't.

02:57.640 --> 02:58.600
No!

02:59.160 --> 03:00.080
Sorry.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.760
-Élodie!
-Élodie?

03:03.360 --> 03:04.240
Élodie…

03:05.080 --> 03:06.280
Oh, my poor boy.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.440
I'm afraid it's a no.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.240
I'm sorry, Lucas. I…

03:32.320 --> 03:33.160
I can't.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.320
I'm sorry, Lucas. I can't.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.680
I'm sorry, Lucas. I…

03:40.120 --> 03:41.160
Are you okay?

03:42.120 --> 03:43.880
Yeah, I know. I heard about…

03:44.400 --> 03:46.320
It must be hard for you.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.000
Yeah, it's not easy.

03:48.080 --> 03:50.520
You're a great guy. Good-looking too.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.560
-Really?
-You're the cutest teacher in school.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.280
Who knows? You might find someone
sooner than you think.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.760
I know it isn't a good time, but…

04:01.240 --> 04:02.440
But, Léa…

04:03.960 --> 04:05.880
I feel something between us too,

04:06.760 --> 04:08.400
but it's too soon for me.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.320
-Lucas?
-Yeah?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.080
It's not my phone number.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.240
It's my bank details.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.080
The others and I were wondering

04:18.160 --> 04:21.600
if you could pay back the money
we collected for your wedding gift

04:21.680 --> 04:23.720
since there wasn't any wedding.

04:23.800 --> 04:25.280
No rush though.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.440
But don't take too long.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.760
Hi, Corine. It's Lucas.

04:40.680 --> 04:42.400
Would you please tell Élodie…

04:43.920 --> 04:46.480
Tell your daughter it's okay.
I've moved on.

04:48.920 --> 04:50.320
I don't want…

04:50.400 --> 04:52.320
You're a bitch! And you're ugly!

04:52.400 --> 04:54.240
I want you back.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.280
Élodie?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.400
-Hi, sweetie!
-Hello!

05:03.920 --> 05:05.000
-Hi!
-It's us.

05:05.080 --> 05:07.800
We popped by the caterer's
to pick up the food.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.160
We've taken some for us already.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.200
Right, sweetie.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.880
I know it's hard
to believe me right now, but trust me.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.360
There's always light
at the end of the tunnel.

05:28.440 --> 05:29.520
Or a train.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.680
Where are the tools
I got you for Christmas?

05:32.760 --> 05:34.560
Your kitchen drawer won't shut.

05:34.640 --> 05:37.640
Dad, Mom, thanks for coming,
but I want to be alone.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.800
Oh, what's this?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.440
This is gorgeous!

05:43.760 --> 05:45.920
It's the brochure for our honeymoon.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.320
You wanted to take her there?

05:50.000 --> 05:52.360
It's the prettiest resort in Mauritius.

05:53.800 --> 05:54.840
Looks expensive!

05:54.920 --> 05:59.480
You've no idea. I had to take out a loan.
And the agency won't even refund me.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.880
Well, go then. It'll do you good.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.160
-Sure. All on my own?
-I could go with you if you want.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.280
Mom, can you hear yourself?

06:08.080 --> 06:12.400
-I'm not honeymooning with my mother.
-I know, Lucas. I was kidding.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.760
I'll call them and get your money back.
Don't be such a doormat.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.240
-Mom!
-Yes!

06:18.320 --> 06:20.320
Without me, everyone gets ripped off!

06:24.440 --> 06:27.240
You know, Lucas, after our wedding,

06:28.200 --> 06:30.040
we planned to go to Rio.

06:32.120 --> 06:33.520
See? It was her dream.

06:34.440 --> 06:36.760
But work,

06:37.280 --> 06:39.160
buying the house, your arrival…

06:39.240 --> 06:40.200
Just life.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.880
We never went.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.200
Shit, it's Élodie. Can you go?

06:48.280 --> 06:49.600
Say hi from me.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.480
Is that your only solution?

06:51.560 --> 06:53.840
-Élodie?
-With who? His mother?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.760
-I'm glad you called.
-Really?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.800
-Didn't you want me dead?
-I can't hear you. Where are you?

06:59.880 --> 07:02.080
Where Damien works. Cool, right?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.040
What? I thought he was a mechanic.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.640
No, I just said he worked with cars.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.680
-Are you okay? Who is it?
-Lucas.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.000
How awful. Poor guy.

07:12.760 --> 07:13.600
He's so nice.

07:14.640 --> 07:17.640
You mean a lot to me, Lucas,
but with Damien, it's stronger.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.720
Élodie, if you called to rub it in--

07:19.800 --> 07:21.400
No, don't hang up! Wait.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.920
On our wedding day,
I stupidly left my keys at home.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.840
We're at the Miami GP next week
and I don't have any clothes.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.960
Can I come by next week?

07:32.040 --> 07:33.880
-No.
-Why not?

07:33.960 --> 07:36.240
Well, next week won't be possible.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.560
But why?

07:37.640 --> 07:40.600
-I'll be in Mauritius. Remember?
-You're going?

07:40.680 --> 07:42.680
-Alone?
-Why would I be alone?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.560
You're not irreplaceable. Get real.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.440
Who are you going with, Lucas?

07:48.680 --> 07:50.000
None of your business.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.760
Lucas, sweetie. Where's your passport?

07:57.200 --> 07:58.040
Sweetie?

07:58.120 --> 08:02.600
I'd rather you gave it to me,
so you don't lose it. Right?

08:11.600 --> 08:14.400
Compliments of the airline
on your honeymoon.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.440
How lovely. Here you go, sweetie.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.120
-How kind.
-You're welcome.

08:18.200 --> 08:19.400
Would you like a photo?

08:20.480 --> 08:22.360
-No, thanks. It's fine.
-I'd like one.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.120
-Give me your phone.
-Yes.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.720
Right.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.600
It'd be better with a kiss,
don't you think?

08:31.240 --> 08:32.200
Go on.

08:33.440 --> 08:36.080
-There. Enjoy the flight, lovebirds.
-Thanks.

08:45.480 --> 08:49.480
HONEYMOON CRASHER

08:50.720 --> 08:52.920
Can you stop sulking for one second?

08:53.000 --> 08:56.000
I always gave you kisses as a boy.
You loved it.

08:58.000 --> 08:58.880
Mom, stop!

09:06.760 --> 09:08.160
-Hello.
-Hello.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.520
-Welcome to Mauritius.
-Thank you.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.760
There is a small snag.
Apparently, our room isn't ready.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.400
Oh, you speak French. Yes.

09:22.480 --> 09:27.000
We had an issue with the previous guests,
but don't worry, it'll soon be sorted.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.200
Yes, but my wife is tired.

09:29.280 --> 09:31.720
You'd never guess. You look ravishing!

09:31.800 --> 09:34.080
We'll give you two cocktails. Don't worry.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.120
Frankly, for the price we're paying,
it's unacceptable.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.240
Oh, these young people, they are so tired.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.360
-And you are Mrs…
-Duvivier.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.560
Duvivier, exactly. And Mr. Duvivier?

09:45.640 --> 09:48.000
-He's over there, taking photos.
-So I see.

09:48.080 --> 09:49.200
He's young.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.160
Yes, but he's not tired.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.320
-Are you coming, sweetie?
-Yeah.

09:55.840 --> 09:57.400
This way, please.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.640
You see, Ryan? People usually criticize
an age difference,

10:02.720 --> 10:05.280
but with those two, it's not a problem.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.720
I think they think we're a couple.

10:07.800 --> 10:08.880
It's funny, right?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.120
No, it's not. It's gross.

10:11.640 --> 10:15.000
When I picked you up from school,
people took me for your sister.

10:15.080 --> 10:17.440
Marrying my sister is gross too.

10:17.520 --> 10:21.920
Age is just a state of mind.
You could say he looks older than her.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.840
Only one bed!

10:22.920 --> 10:25.200
This is the island of love
with a capital L.

10:25.280 --> 10:27.200
The sea is a caress.

10:27.280 --> 10:29.120
The air is aphrodisiac.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.480
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.600
Sir.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.800
A night of romance here
washes all your problems away.

10:35.880 --> 10:38.280
If the gentleman performs, of course.

10:38.360 --> 10:39.680
Where will I sleep?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.400
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.720
If I may, this doesn't match
the brochure at all.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.200
Just look.

10:46.280 --> 10:49.440
Where's the terrace
with the pool and the lagoon view?

10:49.520 --> 10:51.880
-And the sauna?
-I see the misunderstanding.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.480
This is gorgeous, of course,
but that is the Villa Royale.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.560
It's much more expensive, of course.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.920
But I've already spent a fortune!

11:00.000 --> 11:01.840
There isn't even a couch!

11:01.920 --> 11:04.400
-Oh, my.
-You'll have to excuse him.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.120
He's still emotional.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.840
-The wedding was a huge shock.
-I'm sure!

11:09.920 --> 11:13.520
No, you have no idea.
Just talking about it gives me chills.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.480
Chills?

11:15.640 --> 11:17.520
It gives her chills, Ryan!

11:18.160 --> 11:19.640
I have chills too.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.840
I hate seeing him like this.

11:23.360 --> 11:26.920
But he did all he could
to make this honeymoon unforgettable.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.920
He's up to his neck in debt.

11:29.000 --> 11:32.120
You're a very lucky lady, Mrs. Duvivier.

11:32.200 --> 11:34.120
-You can call me Lily.
-Lily.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.720
Are you thinking what I'm thinking, Ryan?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.240
-Their happiness is our happiness.
-Yes.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.640
Exactly!

11:54.720 --> 11:56.640
Tachán!

11:56.720 --> 11:57.720
Come on in.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.640
And now,

11:59.720 --> 12:00.680
the view.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.360
Here we are. The Villa Royale.

12:14.080 --> 12:16.080
It's like winning the lottery!

12:16.720 --> 12:18.680
The Villa Royale is all-inclusive.

12:18.760 --> 12:22.760
Excursions, activities, spa, massages,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.720
full board with our chef, Vincent.

12:25.800 --> 12:30.040
He is at your beck and call 24/7
to titillate your taste buds.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.160
It's all included!

12:31.240 --> 12:33.520
-Amazing.
-Happy?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.760
Yes, he's very happy.

12:36.840 --> 12:40.200
You know, Lily.
For us, you're an exceptional couple.

12:40.280 --> 12:42.440
You have no idea how much I admire you.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.040
Usually, couples fit into the same mold.

12:45.120 --> 12:46.640
Old-old or young-young.

12:46.720 --> 12:47.560
Old-young,

12:47.640 --> 12:50.760
but it's always an older man
with a younger lady.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.560
But you are exceptional.

12:53.640 --> 12:59.000
That's why Ryan and I are making
this exceptional exception.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.520
Did you hear that, sweetie?

13:02.320 --> 13:03.560
Right, Mr. Duvivier?

13:03.640 --> 13:08.040
Let's continue the tour
because the bedroom awaits.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.040
Go ahead!

13:11.880 --> 13:13.600
Lucas, look at the bathroom.

13:13.680 --> 13:17.000
-And this is the bridal suite!
-Look how beautiful it is!

13:18.280 --> 13:21.480
Come here.
We still have to perform the petal ritual.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.480
It's very important.

13:27.160 --> 13:30.480
And I now declare your honeymoon open!

13:30.560 --> 13:32.080
Congratulations, Lily.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.760
Thank you, Gloria.

13:36.200 --> 13:39.520
I'm sure this beautiful couple
would like some privacy.

13:39.600 --> 13:42.200
Am I right, Mr. Duvivier?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.040
-Enjoy your stay.
-Thank you.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.200
Thanks again.

13:48.720 --> 13:49.960
What are you doing?

13:50.040 --> 13:51.400
What do you mean?

13:52.080 --> 13:54.520
She upgraded us
because she thinks we're married!

13:54.600 --> 13:55.440
Well, yes.

13:55.520 --> 13:58.160
What happens when she finds out
you're my mother?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.240
We don't have to tell her.

14:01.240 --> 14:02.200
This is insane.

14:02.280 --> 14:05.840
Come on! What does it cost us?
We just need to play along for her.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.600
Can't you see we're living the dream?
Come on, Lucas. Don't spoil it.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.200
Right?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.480
Come on, Lucas.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.680
Lucas, please.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.040
Okay.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.440
-Don't you want a cuddle from Mommy?
-Stop. Too much.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.520
I'm in heaven.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.280
This is hell.

15:01.080 --> 15:02.040
Hi, sweetie!

15:02.960 --> 15:04.600
Have you been waiting long?

15:07.040 --> 15:07.920
Isn't this nice?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.040
Why don't we visit that island?

15:16.120 --> 15:18.640
No, Mom, but if you want to,
don't mind me.

15:18.720 --> 15:20.840
No. I won't leave you on your own.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.840
Oh, Lucas. You're already red.
Put some cream on.

15:24.920 --> 15:25.960
Mom!

15:26.040 --> 15:28.120
Come on! Fine. Don't wear any.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.040
It accelerates skin aging.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.600
People will soon think we're the same age.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.200
-Put some cream on me.
-You can't go topless!

15:38.880 --> 15:42.880
I don't want tan lines. It's ugly.
Put some cream on my back, please.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.680
Come on. Do it for your mom.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.480
-Do the shoulders properly.
-Yes.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.640
-I told you to do my shoulders.
-Yes.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.240
That's it. Lower now.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.040
No! What about my lower back?

16:12.120 --> 16:15.360
Come on!
When you do something, do it right.

16:26.760 --> 16:27.720
Thank you.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.320
In 20 minutes!

16:34.400 --> 16:35.440
Hi, guys.

16:35.960 --> 16:37.760
This is in 20 minutes.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.680
Oh, if it isn't our lovebirds!

16:42.200 --> 16:44.560
Having fun? Did you enjoy the sunshine?

16:45.160 --> 16:46.120
It was divine.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.560
Look, in 20 minutes,
there's a fantastic quad bike excursion

16:50.640 --> 16:51.960
to La Vallée des Couleurs.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.560
I highly recommend it. It's gorgeous.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.440
-Fancy it, sweetie?
-No, I don't feel like it.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.640
Come on, Mr. Duvivier!

16:58.720 --> 17:00.120
Make your wife happy!

17:00.760 --> 17:02.720
-I'll handle it, Mrs. Duvivier.
-Thanks.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.080
-Go. I'll head back to the room.
-To do what?

17:05.160 --> 17:07.720
-Sit around and sulk?
-Maya! Another couple for you.

17:07.800 --> 17:10.280
-Don't forget that I'm grieving.
-Hi!

17:11.480 --> 17:12.360
Hello.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.600
Come over.

17:15.080 --> 17:19.000
Quads are fun, but I organize boat tours.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.520
It's quieter, more eco-friendly,
and just as exhilarating. If you fancy it?

17:23.600 --> 17:25.280
Would you prefer that, sweetie?

17:25.360 --> 17:27.840
-No, we're going quad biking.
-We are?

17:27.920 --> 17:29.800
-Yes.
-Maybe another time.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.680
-I hope so.
-Shall we?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.120
-See you soon.
-See you.

17:48.080 --> 17:48.920
Awesome!

17:59.320 --> 18:01.280
Come on. Put your foot down!

18:01.880 --> 18:02.720
All good?

18:09.920 --> 18:12.000
All right. We can get going.

18:12.080 --> 18:15.360
I'd like to show you a viewpoint,
so we'll continue on foot.

18:15.440 --> 18:17.840
-Park up there.
-Come on!

18:17.920 --> 18:20.400
-Remember to balance the weight.
-Yeah.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.880
-Okay? Any questions?
-There.

18:23.840 --> 18:26.560
-No questions? Because now is the time.
-It's fine.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.840
Let's go as a group.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.240
Hey, she's cute, isn't she?

18:30.320 --> 18:32.040
-Who is?
-Oh, please!

18:32.120 --> 18:33.800
-The way you look at her.
-Ready?

18:34.320 --> 18:36.320
What? I just said that she's cute.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.520
-It's fine.
-Mom!

18:37.600 --> 18:39.480
-I'm not Mom. I'm Lily.
-Coming?

18:40.160 --> 18:41.040
Yes.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.160
A bit further. Almost there.

18:46.600 --> 18:47.520
Here it is.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.640
-See for yourselves.
-Up there?

18:49.720 --> 18:51.720
The clouds will lift. Don't worry.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.280
It's slippery.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.480
Careful. It's slippery.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.800
You're lucky. She's a live wire.

19:08.880 --> 19:10.320
-Who?
-Your wife.

19:10.400 --> 19:11.960
She isn't my wife.

19:13.120 --> 19:15.800
Did I offend you?
You're allowed to like mature women.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.760
-I don't judge.
-She's my mother, not my wife.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.640
-Are you coming?
-Yes.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.560
-You married your mother?
-I'm not married.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.440
Okay. But you are
on honeymoon with your mom.

19:27.520 --> 19:31.000
Listen, it's complicated.
But don't tell my mom I told you.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.840
It's very important to her.

19:32.920 --> 19:33.960
Okay.

19:36.240 --> 19:37.360
Here we are.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.200
If you want photos, this is the best spot.

19:40.800 --> 19:43.480
Come on. Could you take one of us?

19:43.560 --> 19:46.000
-Of course.
-I'll post it on Instagram.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.480
Okay?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.320
Our friends will be jealous!

19:54.400 --> 19:55.960
Perfect. Here you go.

19:56.040 --> 19:58.960
Thank you. You're so sweet!

19:59.560 --> 20:02.000
Excuse me. Could we get a photo together?

20:02.080 --> 20:04.200
-I want to make my friends jealous too.
-Sure.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.400
Could you take our photo, M-- Lily?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.600
Of course!

20:08.800 --> 20:09.920
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

20:10.440 --> 20:11.760
-Right.
-Okay, one sec.

20:13.920 --> 20:14.760
There.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.120
You look great! So gorgeous.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.360
-Maybe closer. Like this.
-Yes!

20:19.880 --> 20:22.000
Yes, a bit… Like that.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.440
Yes, that's lovely.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.120
-Beautiful!
-Great.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.840
One last one. Okay?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.720
-I think--
-Last one.

20:30.800 --> 20:31.920
Great. Awesome.

20:32.000 --> 20:33.280
-Perfect.
-Great.

20:33.360 --> 20:34.760
We need to head back.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.200
-Here. Look!
-I love it!

20:36.280 --> 20:38.800
-Everyone got pictures?
-Awesome. Perfect.

20:40.640 --> 20:41.920
No, I'm driving.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.600
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.320
And we're off!

20:59.920 --> 21:00.840
Mom!

21:04.480 --> 21:05.400
Watch the bend!

21:05.480 --> 21:06.560
Turn, Mom!

21:08.040 --> 21:08.960
No!

21:12.120 --> 21:13.280
Hold on!

21:15.360 --> 21:16.560
Not the forest!

21:19.680 --> 21:20.560
No!

21:24.520 --> 21:25.920
Watch out!

21:31.240 --> 21:33.520
-That was awesome!
-Have you lost your mind?

21:33.600 --> 21:36.200
-It was fun, wasn't it?
-No, not at all.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.240
Oh, you're always
so afraid of everything, Lucas!

21:39.320 --> 21:40.520
Whose fault is that?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.240
So irresponsible!

21:43.840 --> 21:46.600
-You're no fun. Spoilsport.
-You almost killed us!

21:48.480 --> 21:49.440
Are you okay?

21:49.520 --> 21:51.040
That was great!

21:51.120 --> 21:52.560
Yeah, so great.

21:52.640 --> 21:53.480
So great!

21:55.480 --> 21:56.800
I want to try everything.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.360
The buffet is incredible.

22:07.080 --> 22:08.040
I'm not hungry.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.720
Come on.
You're not on hunger strike. Look.

22:13.480 --> 22:16.480
-Some muesli. Just how you like it.
-Give me a break, Mom.

22:16.560 --> 22:19.520
Stop calling me "Mom"
or we'll get found out.

22:23.000 --> 22:23.960
Hello.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.960
Hello. May we join you?

22:26.760 --> 22:28.520
-Of course.
-Really?

22:28.600 --> 22:31.800
Great! We've been wanting
to talk to you since we arrived.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.120
Yeah!

22:33.200 --> 22:36.560
We thought we could connect
by telling you how we met.

22:36.640 --> 22:37.520
So, yeah!

22:38.040 --> 22:39.600
You'll see, it's…

22:39.680 --> 22:42.640
So, at lunchtime,
I was at the company cafeteria

22:42.720 --> 22:45.000
and I plucked up the courage to say,

22:46.160 --> 22:47.880
"Hello, is this seat free?"

22:48.720 --> 22:51.240
-Wow, that's incredible.
-I swear.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.720
-Right, my pantheress?
-Yes, my koala bear.

22:53.800 --> 22:56.160
Oh, hear that, my little marmoset?

22:56.680 --> 22:59.960
I remember it
like it was yesterday because that day,

23:00.960 --> 23:02.160
I had chicken

23:02.840 --> 23:05.040
with… broccoli.

23:05.640 --> 23:08.080
Well, if that isn't a sign, what is?

23:10.720 --> 23:12.720
-Don't even think about it.
-Okay.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.280
-What about you?
-Us?

23:14.360 --> 23:16.840
-How did you two meet?
-We…

23:16.920 --> 23:18.280
We…

23:18.360 --> 23:21.960
It's a long story.
We won't bore you with that.

23:22.560 --> 23:23.440
Why not?

23:24.640 --> 23:25.760
Really?

23:26.360 --> 23:27.560
On the maternity ward.

23:29.640 --> 23:30.960
The maternity ward?

23:31.800 --> 23:34.120
You'll see. It's a really funny story.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.880
Go on! Tell us!

23:35.960 --> 23:37.640
I was there because of my mother.

23:37.720 --> 23:39.680
-Your mother?
-Yes.

23:39.760 --> 23:42.720
She'd just given birth
to a very beautiful baby.

23:42.800 --> 23:44.720
-That's what you say.
-It's true.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.960
Because you were his mom's friend?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.880
Yes, kind of.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.520
Kind of? Please. You were very close.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.480
She was there when I was born.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.400
Really?

23:55.400 --> 23:57.520
She was the first person to hold me.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.000
-It was love at first sight.
-Stop!

24:01.080 --> 24:04.080
-No, he's kidding.
-Not at all.

24:04.160 --> 24:05.920
We've been together ever since.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.040
It does bring you closer.
Changing diapers,

24:10.120 --> 24:13.520
putting talc on my little bottom,
walks in the stroller…

24:16.840 --> 24:18.720
Hello, lovebirds!

24:18.800 --> 24:20.320
-How are we doing?
-Great!

24:20.400 --> 24:22.160
I'd like to invite you

24:22.240 --> 24:24.640
to a fun couple's competition

24:24.720 --> 24:27.240
that is about to start by the pool.

24:28.080 --> 24:28.920
Coming?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.960
-Awesome. Fancy it, honey?
-Great.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.000
Come on!

24:32.720 --> 24:34.600
-See you later.
-See you. Thanks.

24:34.680 --> 24:35.640
See you.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.200
Finally, an activity.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.200
-No activity for you two?
-I'm not sure.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.720
Come on, Lily, do it for me.

24:44.800 --> 24:48.760
We must show these youngsters
that there's strength in difference.

24:48.840 --> 24:51.360
-How about it, sweetie?
-Come on, Mom…

24:53.440 --> 24:55.320
I mean, hon.

24:55.400 --> 24:56.680
-Of course.
-Hon.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.600
Come on. Come on, Lily.

24:59.680 --> 25:00.880
Yes, come on.

25:00.960 --> 25:02.640
I'm sure you'll beat them.

25:03.600 --> 25:05.480
Come on. Vamos, I'll wait for you.

25:05.560 --> 25:07.240
Well, vamos?

25:08.200 --> 25:09.960
So, the rules. Watch.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.120
You have to separate yourself
from your partner

25:13.200 --> 25:15.120
without letting go of the scarf.

25:15.200 --> 25:17.480
For example, I could go like this…

25:28.800 --> 25:30.040
Okay. Are you ready?

25:30.120 --> 25:30.960
Music!

25:33.520 --> 25:35.880
Cheer on the couples with music!

25:36.480 --> 25:37.920
-I can't, Mom.
-Focus.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.880
-Look!
-This is hard!

25:39.960 --> 25:41.480
-Not like that.
-Come on!

25:41.560 --> 25:43.080
Come on, baby. Kiss!

25:45.680 --> 25:47.120
-Yes. Oh, no.
-No.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.640
Good!

25:48.720 --> 25:52.000
Come on. You can figure it out!

25:52.520 --> 25:53.560
Careful.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.320
-Is that right?
-Wait…

25:59.000 --> 25:59.960
No, hold on…

26:00.560 --> 26:03.640
-You have to pass it over.
-What are you doing?

26:03.720 --> 26:05.880
No, go between my legs.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.160
Too close for comfort.

26:11.400 --> 26:14.840
This is hell on earth.
Too much touching. We look ridiculous.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.840
-Right, go back up.
-And under.

26:16.920 --> 26:18.520
Down here. Yes!

26:18.600 --> 26:21.080
-Bravo! We have our winning couple!
-What?

26:22.600 --> 26:23.560
Well done.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.000
Listen, baby. Shall we do the bomb?

26:31.400 --> 26:34.640
Frankly, you were useless.
I'm so annoyed. We were so close.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.040
You just needed to focus a little.

26:38.120 --> 26:40.120
To think I should be here with Élodie…

26:40.200 --> 26:42.960
Why? You think you had
more chance of winning with her?

26:43.040 --> 26:44.920
Mom, I don't care about winning.

26:45.880 --> 26:48.160
You don't care about winning? Clearly.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.880
You didn't exactly fight for Élodie.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.840
-Excuse me?
-No, wait.

26:52.920 --> 26:54.880
It's better this way. I wasn't a fan.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.280
That's news to me!
I thought you liked her.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.120
I never said that.

26:59.200 --> 27:02.400
You did. I quote,
"Of all your girlfriends, I prefer her."

27:02.480 --> 27:04.840
-Have you seen the others?
-What about them?

27:04.920 --> 27:08.960
Listen, sweetie. You've always preferred
bad company to no company.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.120
That's kind of your problem, isn't it?

27:11.640 --> 27:14.640
I shouldn't have brought you.
It was a huge mistake.

27:15.600 --> 27:19.080
Lucas, try looking
on the bright side for once.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.480
We've had a great day. Right?

27:21.560 --> 27:24.920
That's why I'm here, to cheer you up.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.520
But mostly to have a good time.

27:28.120 --> 27:30.160
All right, tell me. What can I do?

27:30.240 --> 27:31.480
Nothing.

27:31.560 --> 27:34.440
In fact, having you constantly
on my back is stifling.

27:34.520 --> 27:35.760
It's suffocating.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.080
Don't drink the tap water.
You'll get sick.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.720
That's exactly what I mean. Watch.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.720
Oh, that's good water.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.160
I'm drinking.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.720
And nothing's happening.

27:53.400 --> 27:54.600
Great. I warned you.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.720
Oh, you're such a giant pain in the ass!

27:58.800 --> 28:00.720
Take it easy, Lucas.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.360
Do you know why I was
in such a hurry to leave home?

28:03.880 --> 28:06.200
In a hurry? You were 26, sweetie.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.880
I was sick of you saying, "Don't do that."

28:10.400 --> 28:13.000
"Don't drink that.
Use sunscreen. Put on a scarf."

28:13.080 --> 28:14.720
"No school trips. You're too nice."

28:14.800 --> 28:17.520
-"You'll get abused by a teacher."
-It happens, sweetie.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.560
"You can't go to Hugo's. You'll get lice.
Not the pool. You'll get a verruca."

28:23.640 --> 28:26.640
You kept the stabilizers
on my bike until I was ten!

28:27.480 --> 28:29.200
Well, you are quite clumsy.

28:29.280 --> 28:32.040
You interfere with everything.
It's unbearable.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.640
But it's normal, Lucas.
I'm your mother. I'm protecting you.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.840
It isn't normal. It's insufferable.
You even came on my honeymoon!

28:38.920 --> 28:40.360
You asked me to come.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.040
Because I felt sorry for you.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.560
Okay, fine. I get it. Fine!

28:49.600 --> 28:51.280
I'm a pain. I hold you back.

28:51.360 --> 28:53.920
I'm an awful mother
who made your life hell.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.960
So if wallowing makes you
feel better, carry on.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.640
But you know what?
This is my first trip in years.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.400
So, you're right.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.160
I intend on enjoying myself.

29:21.640 --> 29:22.960
Hi, Michel. It's me.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.040
What's wrong? You sound strange.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.240
No, I'm fine.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.760
I just wanted to hear your voice.

29:28.840 --> 29:32.600
I'm at Lucas's place.
I'm fixing a few things while he's away.

29:33.320 --> 29:35.160
Actually, I'm glad you called.

29:35.240 --> 29:37.720
I want to repaint the kitchen.
Something cheerful.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.040
So when he gets home…

29:39.120 --> 29:40.280
How's Lucas doing?

29:40.360 --> 29:43.800
You should see this place.
It's stunning, and he can't even enjoy it.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.960
I wish you were here with me.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.440
Where?

29:49.200 --> 29:50.240
Well, here.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.200
Michel, are you even listening to me?

29:53.280 --> 29:54.640
Of course I am.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.960
If it was just you and me,
it would've been wonderful.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.120
Wonderful!

30:01.200 --> 30:03.280
-Closes perfectly.
-What?

30:03.360 --> 30:05.080
The drawer. I fixed it.

30:05.760 --> 30:06.920
Fantastic.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.520
The solution to all Lucas's problems.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.480
We still need to pick a color.

30:11.560 --> 30:12.600
A color?

30:13.760 --> 30:15.280
For the kitchen, Lily.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.960
Are you with me or not?

30:17.640 --> 30:18.600
No, I'm not.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.480
I'm here, and I'm hanging up.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.480
"Cheetah Yellow"? Maybe not.

30:42.280 --> 30:43.400
Mom, it's me again.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.840
I just wanted to say…

30:47.240 --> 30:48.680
I'm glad you're here.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.000
Thanks, Ryan.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.280
It's so peaceful.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.440
What a long day.

31:03.960 --> 31:06.240
We're almost done. Then, time for bed.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.440
Bed?

31:09.080 --> 31:10.560
Yes, bed.

31:11.880 --> 31:12.960
Bed?

31:14.080 --> 31:15.080
Bed, yes.

31:15.800 --> 31:18.040
-Bed.
-Bed?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.640
Yes, bed.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.560
Oh, there's Mr. Duvivier.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.440
I'll follow him.

31:34.640 --> 31:35.600
Bed…

31:41.240 --> 31:42.200
May I?

31:43.560 --> 31:44.400
Yes.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.800
Are you alone?
Isn't your husband with you?

31:47.880 --> 31:50.800
My husband is the last thing
I want to talk about.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.160
Seriously, is it so hard
for a man to listen?

31:55.840 --> 31:57.440
I've heard I'm very good at it.

32:03.880 --> 32:06.600
However, for me to listen,
you'd have to talk.

32:08.600 --> 32:09.560
Sorry.

32:10.680 --> 32:14.600
I was thinking about our fight.
Even then, for it to be a fight,

32:14.680 --> 32:17.240
you'd have to listen
and look at each other.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.360
Sometimes, I think

32:19.440 --> 32:21.920
he prefers his drill to me.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.000
Well, he is missing out.

32:26.680 --> 32:27.520
What?

32:28.760 --> 32:30.640
You're very easy on the eye.

32:44.800 --> 32:45.640
Okay.

32:46.560 --> 32:47.400
Okay.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.920
Oh, no. No!

33:00.000 --> 33:03.320
-Can I have another?
-Sorry, ma'am. I'm closing the bar.

33:05.640 --> 33:08.320
I know a nice place.
It's much more authentic.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.840
-If you fancy it?
-Really?

33:12.360 --> 33:15.280
No, I should probably be getting back.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.400
You can't go to bed now.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.080
Plus, it wouldn't hurt
your husband to worry a little.

33:22.000 --> 33:22.960
Right?

33:25.640 --> 33:26.480
Right…

33:28.400 --> 33:29.360
Hello!

33:30.400 --> 33:32.120
You like moonlit bathing too?

33:33.640 --> 33:34.960
Yeah, I love it. I…

33:35.480 --> 33:37.440
I was out jogging,

33:37.520 --> 33:40.040
and I suddenly felt like going for a dip.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.400
Good choice.
Heed your desires. Don't hold back.

33:43.480 --> 33:44.560
Oh, yeah?

33:44.640 --> 33:47.040
Yeah. I love coming here after work.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.680
I can let go and relax.
It's really important.

33:49.760 --> 33:50.720
Cool.

33:52.560 --> 33:53.520
Are you okay?

33:54.040 --> 33:56.080
-You seem tense.
-A bit.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.520
Give me your hands.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.240
Huh?

34:00.320 --> 34:02.160
I'll listen to your pulse.

34:02.240 --> 34:03.680
-Okay?
-Yes.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.440
You are tense.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.760
Okay. I have an idea.
I'll show you a yoga exercise.

34:10.840 --> 34:13.800
-It's great for evacuating stress.
-Sorry, but…

34:13.880 --> 34:15.720
It will do you good. Trust me.

34:15.800 --> 34:17.640
-Can I touch your body?
-Okay.

34:17.720 --> 34:18.680
Okay. Right.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.640
-I'll put my hands on your stomach.
-Okay.

34:21.720 --> 34:24.960
Now, breathe in for four
while inflating your stomach. Okay?

34:25.040 --> 34:27.200
And when I say so, let it all go.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.280
-What?
-All right. Here we go.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.360
One, two…

34:30.440 --> 34:32.360
-Follow my voice. Two…
-Okay.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.360
Three, inflate.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.480
Four and…

34:37.560 --> 34:40.240
No, sorry! I can't. Sorry!

34:40.800 --> 34:42.600
I'm sorry. So sorry.

34:54.960 --> 34:57.760
I was leading after overtaking
one of the Peyron brothers.

34:57.840 --> 34:58.800
Wow.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.080
One night, dolphins appeared
and swam alongside my boat.

35:03.160 --> 35:06.120
You should've seen it, Lily.
It was magical.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.280
Just incredible.

35:08.040 --> 35:10.560
I think they were trying
to send me a message.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.320
Really? What message?

35:12.400 --> 35:13.440
"Peter,

35:13.520 --> 35:14.800
forget about fame,

35:15.480 --> 35:16.720
money and trophies."

35:17.520 --> 35:19.800
"Choose freedom. Come live with us."

35:20.920 --> 35:22.680
-Well?
-Well, nothing.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.400
I crossed the finish line
and sailed the world seven times.

35:25.480 --> 35:29.080
Yes, well, you still ended up
in a five-star resort.

35:29.160 --> 35:30.760
First, I live on my boat.

35:31.480 --> 35:32.920
This is just a stopover.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.160
I can't resist
the call of the sea for long.

35:37.160 --> 35:40.040
Denis, do you think I can't see you? Huh?

35:40.800 --> 35:41.760
Come with me.

35:42.720 --> 35:43.680
Right now?

35:43.760 --> 35:46.880
Denis, what do you have? Let me see.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.320
You've got to be kidding me.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.360
Give me that!

36:05.680 --> 36:06.640
Give it back!

36:16.200 --> 36:17.160
What?

36:17.760 --> 36:20.000
-Cool, right?
-Yeah, very cool.

36:21.960 --> 36:24.280
It's been a long time since I smoked weed.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.080
Feels good, right?

36:27.600 --> 36:30.480
Weed is cool. I really needed to relax.

36:30.560 --> 36:33.000
-I love it.
-Yeah, it's so good.

36:33.800 --> 36:35.160
-I love it.
-You do?

36:35.240 --> 36:36.840
Yeah, I love it.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.120
Mr. Duvivier.

36:49.720 --> 36:51.440
Can I talk to you for a sec?

36:51.520 --> 36:52.480
Sure.

36:52.560 --> 36:55.040
-Do you think I'm an idiot?
-Why?

36:55.120 --> 36:58.040
You think I don't know
what you were doing in the water?

36:58.120 --> 37:00.520
While your lovely wife, Lily, sleeps.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.800
No, it's not what you think.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.240
Act with some decorum, Mr. Duvivier.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.600
Don't you realize?

37:06.680 --> 37:09.360
You just got married.
I've never seen the like before.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.560
Have you no shame?

37:11.080 --> 37:13.920
-I'm telling you--
-Listen closely, Mr. Duvivier.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.320
If I catch you near Maya again,

37:18.400 --> 37:21.720
I'll have to tell your wife.
I don't want to, but I will.

37:22.680 --> 37:25.720
And I'll make your stay here
a living nightmare.

37:25.800 --> 37:27.240
Do you understand?

37:27.320 --> 37:29.680
-Yes, but it's a misunderstanding--
-Is that clear?

37:30.200 --> 37:31.160
Crystal. Yes.

37:33.360 --> 37:34.360
-Gloria.
-Yes?

37:35.040 --> 37:36.840
There's an issue with the restrooms.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.120
Some idiot blocked the toilet
with a white sock.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.440
-It's overflowing.
-That's all we need.

37:42.240 --> 37:44.000
I can see you're busy…

37:44.720 --> 37:45.800
I'll leave you to it.

37:48.040 --> 37:49.080
This guy…

37:52.520 --> 37:53.560
Wait…

38:13.680 --> 38:16.000
NEW POST
DREAM DATE

39:30.960 --> 39:32.240
Thank you, Peter.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.920
-That was cool.
-So cool.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.640
-Really cool.
-Totally cool.

39:35.720 --> 39:36.760
Yeah, it was…

39:36.840 --> 39:39.960
Oh, it's so sad in here.
We need some music right now.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.160
I wanted to get her home safely.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.360
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

39:52.080 --> 39:55.640
Have you seen the time?
You could have called. I was worried.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.920
Oh, that's so sweet.

39:59.000 --> 40:01.800
The little boy is worried about his mommy.

40:01.880 --> 40:02.840
You're drunk.

40:03.840 --> 40:05.000
And then some.

40:05.080 --> 40:07.800
Wait. Don't tell me
you've been smoking weed.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.000
You're worse than a kid. Bed, now.

40:11.680 --> 40:13.960
-You're no fun.
-I said, go to bed!

40:14.680 --> 40:15.640
Fine.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.600
First, a midnight skinny-dip!

40:18.680 --> 40:21.040
What? No, Mom. What are you doing?

40:21.120 --> 40:23.440
No one can see me. We have no neighbors.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.760
But I can see you. Go to bed!

40:25.840 --> 40:28.520
Oh, did you hear?
When you shook it, it went…

40:28.600 --> 40:29.600
Hear it? Listen.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.440
-Mom, time for bed.
-Can you hear that?

40:34.040 --> 40:35.960
Come on, Mom.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.000
Here we are.

40:39.240 --> 40:41.200
I'm glad you had a fun night.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.560
Oh, yes.

40:43.240 --> 40:45.760
The second you're alone,
you're partying with some guy.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.720
Sorry, but he's not "some guy."

40:48.800 --> 40:50.120
He is a great captain.

40:50.200 --> 40:53.200
He's Peter, the greatest captain.

40:55.320 --> 40:58.240
I wanted to say
that I may be annoying, but you…

40:58.320 --> 41:00.600
How dull are you?

41:00.680 --> 41:02.320
So dull.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.960
The dullest of the dull.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.800
No wonder Élodie got back with her ex.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.880
He seemed much more fun with his…

41:20.160 --> 41:21.400
You're boring.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.240
So boring…

41:36.320 --> 41:37.160
Boring.

41:50.720 --> 41:51.680
Oh, fuck.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.600
-Lucas, who's that girl?
-Which girl?

41:58.680 --> 42:01.120
The girl you're posting on social media.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.320
This is one big joke.

42:03.400 --> 42:06.600
Here I am, feeling guilty as fuck,

42:06.680 --> 42:10.520
and you're on the other side of the world
with some girl on our honeymoon.

42:10.600 --> 42:11.640
Our honeymoon?

42:12.480 --> 42:15.320
Sorry, I checked,
but you're nowhere to be found.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.840
Not by the pool or the private beach.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.880
Or in the hot tub or the spa. Nowhere.

42:21.680 --> 42:23.040
Is that the suite?

42:23.120 --> 42:25.400
See that? I wasn't pissing you around.

42:26.400 --> 42:28.920
-Élodie, can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.480
-Why did you leave me?
-Lucas…

42:33.320 --> 42:35.240
-Tell me. I can take it.
-Sure?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.200
-Yes.
-Really sure?

42:37.280 --> 42:38.880
-Yes.
-Well…

42:39.600 --> 42:43.280
How should I put it?
You're a nice guy, but you're a bit…

42:43.360 --> 42:44.560
You're…

42:44.640 --> 42:45.920
You're a bit boring.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.440
What? Don't make that face. It's true.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.960
-You think I'm boring?
-Yeah, unbelievably boring.

42:54.800 --> 42:57.520
And you were still going to marry me?

42:57.600 --> 42:59.680
Yeah, but that's the thing…

42:59.760 --> 43:02.360
First, you insisted. Second,

43:02.960 --> 43:05.360
when Damien showed up at the town hall,

43:06.040 --> 43:09.680
I saw you and thought,
"Oh God, this is my humdrum life."

43:10.200 --> 43:13.120
"I'll die of boredom with this wussy guy

43:13.200 --> 43:15.720
who needs looking after all the time."

43:15.800 --> 43:18.120
I don't know. I want fast and exciting.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.800
I need action and spontaneity.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.280
With you, I thought
I'd be bored out of my mind.

43:24.360 --> 43:25.720
You know what you need?

43:25.800 --> 43:28.320
A mom. A mom to take care of you 24/7.

43:28.920 --> 43:31.360
Bullshit! You couldn't be more wrong.

43:41.040 --> 43:41.880
Mom?

43:44.320 --> 43:45.160
Mom!

43:45.240 --> 43:48.480
Let's go. One, two, three.

43:48.560 --> 43:50.880
Arms in the air. One, two…

43:52.080 --> 43:53.440
Hi, sweetie. Here I am!

43:54.440 --> 43:56.240
Would you like to join your wife?

43:56.320 --> 43:57.240
Yes, join in!

43:57.320 --> 43:59.000
-No, I'm fine.
-Come on!

43:59.080 --> 44:01.920
-No, it's okay.
-Right, let's keep those arms moving.

44:02.440 --> 44:06.280
Five, six, seven…

44:07.400 --> 44:08.360
All right.

44:08.880 --> 44:09.960
What's wrong?

44:10.480 --> 44:12.240
I just spoke to Élodie.

44:13.040 --> 44:15.400
-She said some horrible things.
-She did?

44:15.480 --> 44:17.240
-You did too.
-Me?

44:17.320 --> 44:19.640
You told me I was boring. Horribly boring.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.280
Shit, I told you.

44:22.200 --> 44:25.840
Élodie said the same thing.
But the worst thing is, you're both right…

44:25.920 --> 44:26.760
I feel awful.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.520
You just need to relax, sweetie.

44:29.600 --> 44:31.720
I know, but I can't.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.240
I'm sad. I'm so sad.

44:36.360 --> 44:37.400
Please help me.

44:38.560 --> 44:40.960
All right, come on. Come with me.

44:41.040 --> 44:42.960
-Where?
-Come on. Follow me.

44:45.600 --> 44:48.080
We'll do some shopping. It'll do you good.

44:50.960 --> 44:51.920
There!

44:52.000 --> 44:54.040
Look. Those shirts are fun.

44:54.720 --> 44:56.400
Look. They're nice.

44:58.800 --> 44:59.760
Looking good.

44:59.840 --> 45:00.680
Try this one.

45:02.280 --> 45:03.760
Not bad, right?

45:04.640 --> 45:05.600
No?

45:07.320 --> 45:08.640
I love it!

45:10.000 --> 45:11.240
Try smiling a bit.

45:16.600 --> 45:17.840
Wait, I have an idea.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.080
Stay here. I'll be back.

45:31.160 --> 45:32.400
With Peter.

45:33.080 --> 45:33.920
Yeah.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.240
You'll see.
It did me the world of good yesterday.

45:41.560 --> 45:42.960
-Hello.
-Hi.

45:43.040 --> 45:43.880
Hello.

45:52.040 --> 45:52.960
Take a seat.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.680
Sit!

46:02.960 --> 46:04.800
Wait here. Stay.

46:04.880 --> 46:06.280
-I'll be back.
-Stay.

46:06.360 --> 46:07.400
Stay.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.280
It's good to get away from
the tourist spots, isn't it?

46:11.840 --> 46:14.120
Look, it's an adventure, right?

46:19.160 --> 46:20.000
What?

46:21.600 --> 46:22.560
Hello.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.600
Say hello.

46:25.680 --> 46:26.640
Hello, sir.

46:27.160 --> 46:28.200
Come on.

46:35.520 --> 46:37.520
Thank you!

46:38.640 --> 46:41.800
-I rolled one. Wanna try?
-It's not for me. It's for my son.

46:55.200 --> 46:56.040
Here.

47:00.680 --> 47:01.640
Go on.

47:01.720 --> 47:02.720
Go on.

47:02.800 --> 47:05.360
-That's it. Inhale!
-Go on. It'll help.

47:05.880 --> 47:07.960
It's 100% natural, so…

47:14.320 --> 47:16.000
-It's strong.
-Yeah.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.000
Pure grass.

47:23.080 --> 47:24.800
-Relax.
-Pure grass.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.480
Good, you're relaxing.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.120
Police!

48:09.560 --> 48:11.040
Police. Identity check.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.040
Nobody moves.

48:15.920 --> 48:17.760
-This is illegal.
-Is it?

48:19.400 --> 48:20.360
It is illegal.

48:21.640 --> 48:22.800
Show me some ID!

48:22.880 --> 48:23.720
What?

48:27.200 --> 48:28.320
Stop!

48:31.120 --> 48:32.600
Denis!

48:35.720 --> 48:37.520
You're a good person, like me.

48:38.320 --> 48:40.360
Give me some love.

48:40.440 --> 48:42.520
Give me some love, Denis.

48:43.840 --> 48:45.000
Goodbye, brother!

48:45.760 --> 48:47.120
Come with us, sir.

48:48.400 --> 48:49.560
You want a hug too?

48:52.880 --> 48:53.880
Oh, that's nice.

48:55.880 --> 48:56.880
Let yourself go.

48:56.960 --> 48:59.880
Cry with me. Let's weep together.

48:59.960 --> 49:01.040
Move it!

49:03.320 --> 49:04.360
Let's go, ma'am.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.080
Mom?

49:29.920 --> 49:30.880
Yes?

49:32.160 --> 49:34.960
I… I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

49:36.080 --> 49:38.800
No, don't say that. I'm the sorry one.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.880
I never should've dragged you into this.

49:41.800 --> 49:45.560
Are you kidding?
We couldn't have done that with the hotel.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.920
Lucas?

49:49.680 --> 49:50.640
Yeah?

49:50.720 --> 49:52.800
-Can I ask you a question?
-Sure.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.560
Why rush into marriage?

49:56.080 --> 49:57.040
I don't get it.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.680
Well, marriage isn't
fashionable anymore, is it?

49:59.760 --> 50:01.080
You didn't have to.

50:03.000 --> 50:06.360
We wanted what you and Dad have.
It's so beautiful.

50:08.360 --> 50:10.880
Yes, well, that's how it may look.

50:10.960 --> 50:14.520
What are you saying?
You are the perfect couple. Zero issues.

50:15.760 --> 50:17.360
Lucas, your father cheated.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.720
-What? With whom?
-No.

50:20.960 --> 50:23.960
With nobody.
He cheated on our life together.

50:25.880 --> 50:28.200
When we met, it was wonderful.

50:28.280 --> 50:32.160
He'd take me out on his bike,
we'd go for rides, we'd party.

50:32.240 --> 50:34.880
We laughed, we danced.

50:34.960 --> 50:38.040
-We made love all the time.
-I don't wanna hear that.

50:38.640 --> 50:39.920
Then we got married.

50:41.160 --> 50:42.880
And, you know…

50:44.280 --> 50:46.720
It all started to disappear, bit by bit.

50:52.160 --> 50:53.120
You know?

50:53.200 --> 50:55.480
Soon, all we had was the house, work,

50:56.600 --> 50:59.200
eating, sleeping and looking after you.

51:03.680 --> 51:06.280
-But you still love Dad?
-Of course I do.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.960
It's just life with him
I don't love so much.

51:14.080 --> 51:17.240
Your wedding to Élodie
might have cost a fortune…

51:17.320 --> 51:18.240
Double that.

51:18.320 --> 51:20.800
It saved you from a lot of disappointment.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.560
So, listen carefully.

51:23.640 --> 51:25.920
If you meet the right person one day,

51:26.000 --> 51:27.440
the secret to it all is

51:27.520 --> 51:30.040
to keep surprising each other every day.

51:30.640 --> 51:31.960
Hear me, Lucas?

51:32.040 --> 51:33.320
Every day.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.920
Have you come down?

51:43.520 --> 51:45.280
Yes.

51:45.360 --> 51:46.840
I am very much down.

51:48.160 --> 51:49.840
-We'll let it slide.
-Really?

51:51.480 --> 51:53.240
-Don't do it again.
-I won't.

51:58.920 --> 52:00.400
Thanks for picking us up.

52:01.000 --> 52:01.920
You're welcome.

52:02.960 --> 52:05.160
My next activity starts in ten minutes.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.560
Can I take you back
to the hotel afterwards?

52:07.640 --> 52:08.480
Okay, sure.

52:09.080 --> 52:09.920
Great!

52:13.040 --> 52:13.880
Too fast?

52:14.480 --> 52:15.440
No, it's fine.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.400
I love going fast.

52:18.600 --> 52:19.440
Cool.

52:29.440 --> 52:32.880
Remember to get a good run-up
to avoid the rocks, okay?

52:32.960 --> 52:35.960
-Ready to jump?
-This is really dangerous.

52:36.040 --> 52:37.800
It isn't dangerous. It's precise.

52:37.880 --> 52:39.120
It's pretty high.

52:39.720 --> 52:42.640
That's why it's fun.
Don't overthink. Just jump.

52:42.720 --> 52:45.720
-This really isn't for you, sweetie.
-You got this.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.600
-Ready?
-Yeah. Wait, I'm not sure.

52:53.000 --> 52:55.040
Right, let's do this.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.600
Come on, jump!

53:14.560 --> 53:16.160
I did it!

53:16.800 --> 53:17.960
Did anyone film it?

53:22.560 --> 53:24.840
I did it! It was incredible!

53:24.920 --> 53:25.880
Incredible.

53:25.960 --> 53:28.160
-The feeling in the air is…
-Amazing!

53:29.440 --> 53:31.240
Who's a scaredy-cat now?

53:33.120 --> 53:35.080
-What's that?
-What? What's wrong?

53:35.600 --> 53:36.520
That thing there.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.920
-Oh, fuck!
-Could you turn around?

53:40.880 --> 53:44.120
Whoa, they're all over your back.
Oh, that's so gross.

53:44.200 --> 53:46.360
-Fuck!
-Keep still. Let me do it. Okay?

53:46.440 --> 53:50.440
-It stings! What are they? Help!
-Tropical leeches. Highly poisonous.

53:50.520 --> 53:51.760
Don't worry. Stay still.

53:51.840 --> 53:54.680
It's like a jellyfish sting.
Peeing on it stops the pain.

53:54.760 --> 53:55.920
-What? No!
-She's right.

53:56.000 --> 53:59.920
Listen, this is the quickest way
or it's straight to the hospital.

54:01.400 --> 54:02.920
Oh, no.

54:11.680 --> 54:12.640
Right…

54:12.720 --> 54:14.720
-No, wait. I'll do it.
-You will?

54:21.840 --> 54:23.360
Ew, gross.

54:31.120 --> 54:35.040
To think I've waited this long
to take such a wonderful trip.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.920
My dream was to travel the world.

54:38.000 --> 54:38.920
-Really?
-Yeah.

54:39.000 --> 54:42.080
Once, when I was 16, I ran away to Spain.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.120
On your own?

54:43.200 --> 54:46.920
No, with William, my boyfriend
at the time. No, it was François.

54:48.440 --> 54:52.480
Or maybe the twins. Daniel and Pascal
were around the same time.

54:53.160 --> 54:54.120
I can't remember.

54:54.200 --> 54:56.280
How many boys were you with before Dad?

54:57.560 --> 55:00.120
-I was quite the catch.
-So it seems.

55:00.200 --> 55:03.120
Yeah. There's plenty
you don't know about me.

55:03.200 --> 55:04.200
I doubt that.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.960
Whereas I know everything about you.

55:08.040 --> 55:09.240
I doubt that too.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.960
A son has no secrets from his mother.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.200
Wanna bet?

55:19.480 --> 55:21.280
-I'll ask a question about me.
-Okay.

55:21.360 --> 55:24.160
If you're wrong
or you don't know, you drink.

55:24.240 --> 55:26.080
Okay. And what if I'm right?

55:26.160 --> 55:28.080
I drink, and you ask a question.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.080
Oh, sweetie. Get ready
for the worst hangover of your life.

55:33.560 --> 55:34.520
Let's start easy.

55:35.560 --> 55:36.680
What was my first job?

55:36.760 --> 55:41.200
You worked all summer
at Bruno's warehouse, your dad's friend.

55:41.280 --> 55:42.240
Too easy.

55:47.440 --> 55:48.400
Your turn.

55:48.480 --> 55:50.960
Same question. What was my first job?

55:51.560 --> 55:52.840
You always taught French.

55:52.920 --> 55:56.200
Actually, when I was 17,
I worked at a pancake restaurant.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.960
-Drink.
-Not fair. I wasn't even born.

55:59.040 --> 56:02.280
You could've shown some interest.
You could've asked.

56:02.800 --> 56:04.120
Go on. Drink.

56:07.080 --> 56:09.080
I know! You'll never get this.

56:09.800 --> 56:11.560
My first time with a girl.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.720
Do you want the date or her name?

56:15.840 --> 56:16.880
You know neither.

56:17.960 --> 56:20.600
True, you're right. It's very personal.

56:20.680 --> 56:23.520
It was Agnès,
the girl who lived down the street,

56:24.040 --> 56:25.720
the day after your 17th birthday.

56:25.800 --> 56:28.440
Your dad and I went
to the movies to see Fear City.

56:28.520 --> 56:32.680
But you claimed to have a fever,
didn't you? To stay at home.

56:34.680 --> 56:37.720
-How did you know?
-Your face when we got home.

56:37.800 --> 56:41.920
Given the huge grin you were wearing,
I'd say you did it at least twice.

56:42.520 --> 56:44.000
-You're too good.
-I know.

56:52.520 --> 56:55.360
-Your turn.
-Should I ask the same question?

56:55.440 --> 56:58.400
Come on, I don't want to know
when you first slept with a boy.

56:58.480 --> 56:59.960
Maybe it wasn't a boy.

57:00.800 --> 57:01.960
No way!

57:03.720 --> 57:05.080
Well, tell me then.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.040
-With Dad?
-No!

57:09.560 --> 57:12.280
-No, not my own son.
-What?

57:12.360 --> 57:16.040
Do you realize what you're saying?
Try harder. That's ridiculous.

57:16.120 --> 57:18.640
You're so old-fashioned, Lucas.

57:18.720 --> 57:20.240
I know. It was François.

57:21.920 --> 57:23.160
No, William.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.720
Not the twins?

57:26.680 --> 57:28.040
You mean Daniel and Pascal?

57:28.120 --> 57:29.760
Both at once?

57:29.840 --> 57:30.720
It was…

57:32.520 --> 57:33.640
It was… Sorry.

57:35.880 --> 57:37.440
-Say it.
-I'm drinking!

57:38.280 --> 57:39.560
Wrong! Go on.

57:42.120 --> 57:43.200
Green.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.200
Not even close.

57:44.280 --> 57:45.600
As a consolation.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.040
It was blue.

58:04.760 --> 58:05.720
I don't know.

58:06.800 --> 58:07.760
When was it?

58:09.320 --> 58:10.400
Six months ago.

58:11.440 --> 58:13.960
They found a small lump in my breast.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.080
Why didn't you tell me?

58:17.600 --> 58:20.680
Because you were busy
planning the wedding.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.680
Did you get the results?

58:23.760 --> 58:26.840
Yes. I'm fine. It was a false alarm.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.160
-Are you sure?
-Certain.

58:29.240 --> 58:30.200
It was a cyst.

58:33.920 --> 58:34.920
What did Dad say?

58:36.360 --> 58:37.440
Dad…

58:37.960 --> 58:39.720
didn't really notice.

58:40.240 --> 58:41.880
He's always miles away.

58:43.080 --> 58:44.120
Lucas.

58:44.200 --> 58:46.440
Nobody noticed.

58:49.480 --> 58:51.240
No, let's stop now.

58:52.240 --> 58:54.800
I already got you high
and look how that turned out.

58:54.880 --> 58:57.960
I don't want to be responsible
for alcohol poisoning too.

58:59.760 --> 59:00.920
See? I was right.

59:02.480 --> 59:04.080
I know everything about you.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.560
And I don't know much about you.

59:11.080 --> 59:12.040
Exactly.

59:12.880 --> 59:14.120
Is that a criticism?

59:14.960 --> 59:15.920
No.

59:17.080 --> 59:18.280
Just an observation.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.120
It'll change, Mom. I promise.

59:32.640 --> 59:33.760
So, let's…

59:33.840 --> 59:36.120
-Careful! Oh, my.
-Yes. I'm good.

59:36.640 --> 59:37.600
I'm fine.

59:38.120 --> 59:40.320
-Are you?
-Who was your first guy?

59:41.680 --> 59:42.680
Or girl.

59:44.320 --> 59:46.800
-Are you sure about this?
-I'm fine. Watch.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.440
Can I help?

59:49.520 --> 59:50.520
-I'm good.
-Sure?

59:56.440 --> 59:57.400
I'm fine!

01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.840
Like this…

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:08.760
-Turn.
-Like this.

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:10.280
-Again.
-Okay.

01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.080
-Your turn.
-My turn.

01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:15.840
Done!

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.080
Tonight, don't forget
our dance contest on the beach.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:22.160
Good luck to our newlyweds
and may the best couple win!

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.680
I love you

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:39.880
I love you

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.000
So, are you two ready?

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:06.200
It'll be hard to beat them.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.080
I think they're going to win.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.160
No, Mrs. Lily.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.240
Come on, you can beat them.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.120
Just feel the music.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.920
We've won for sure.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.040
Wait, I have an idea.
I know how to beat them.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:32.280
Remember the dance contest
when we went camping in Arcachon?

01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:34.200
The year of the World Cup?

01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.360
I asked the German girl
in the next tent to be my partner.

01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.280
Andréa.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.600
You made me practice impressing her.
Remember the steps?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:45.280
Yeah, I should. We rehearsed so much.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.320
I know it by heart. Let's do it.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.640
-Fine, but you can lead. Remind me.
-Okay.

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:53.000
-So, toss your shoulder.
-Yeah.

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.000
-Wave. Twizzle.
-I remember that.

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:56.640
And then--

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.440
Shoulder!

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.960
Wave!

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:09.960
Shoulders.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.160
Wave.

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.320
It's electrifying!

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.120
I'm so happy. I think I'll take it to bed.
I've never won anything before.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.480
Tomorrow morning, remember?

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.840
-10 a.m. Snorkeling.
-Yes.

01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.520
Good night, Mom.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.360
Good night!

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.280
Good night, son!

01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:33.280
Oh, fuck! Hey!

01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.120
Not him again! Come back! No!

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:39.280
Come back here!

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:43.760
Come back!

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:02.400
Little monkey!

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.040
Come on.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.880
What will you do with it now,
you stupid ape?

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.560
No!

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.960
Are you okay?

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.200
Has it stopped stinging?

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.200
Yes. Thank you, ma'am.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.440
Stop with the formalities.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.800
We're closer than that, aren't we?

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:39.720
Expecting a call?

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:41.160
No, the…

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.960
The monkey…

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.720
-The monkeys are odd here.
-Not just the monkeys, apparently.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:54.120
Never a dull moment with you.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.760
I hear that all the time.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.760
What are you doing tomorrow?
It's my day off.

01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.040
I'm going to the most beautiful spot.

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.960
-Fancy joining me?
-I'd love to.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.840
Shit, I can't. I'm snorkeling with my mom.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.560
Too bad.

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:12.960
Wait, Maya!

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.000
I'll make it work.

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.720
Are you comfortable?

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:20.880
Yeah, totally.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.400
This is incredible.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:36.400
-Fancy a swim?
-Yes!

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.320
-Watch out for urchins.
-I will.

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:42.560
I'm not scared.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.760
-Oh, look. An eel.
-Oh, my!

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:56.560
Oh, bon appétit, Mrs. Duvivier!
How are you?

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:57.600
Very well.

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.120
You didn't go snorkeling?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:02.360
No, I didn't want to go alone.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.320
Alone? Where's your husband?

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.840
He's spending the day
with the girl who does the trips.

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:08.880
With Maya?

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.040
-And you let him go?
-Of course.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.000
You shouldn't have.

01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:15.120
Why not?

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.360
I'll tell you something I shouldn't.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.800
-But I'll tell you without telling you.
-Okay.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.680
The other night, your husband
and that Maya girl were in the sea,

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.840
almost naked, very close, in a pretty
compromising position. I didn't tell you.

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.280
That's great news!

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.760
Great news?

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:36.920
Yes, she's a really cute girl.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:41.120
-Aren't you jealous?
-Jealous?

01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:42.160
Oh, jealous!

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.560
-You know, it's not that bad.
-Not that bad?

01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.960
Let me explain.

01:07:50.040 --> 01:07:52.240
My husband and I,

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:54.840
we're inseparable.

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:58.400
So it's important
to give each other some space.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.480
Oh, I see. Yes.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.080
I understand. It's quite clever, actually.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.120
Faithful hearts,

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.360
but freedom of the senses!

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:11.800
Yes, I understand. Sí, sí.

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:14.120
It makes your passion stronger.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:15.680
Your desire grows.

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.560
And dazzling sparks fly!

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.400
Yes.

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:21.200
Something like that.

01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.000
It's very modern of you, Mrs. Lily.

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.320
I didn't expect that.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.800
You're very open, aren't you?

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.600
Open-minded, open-legged,

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:34.760
open to sharing…

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.080
I must tell Ryan. He'll love it.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.200
He'll freak out.

01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:44.880
Mr. and Mrs. Duvivier

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:47.400
are in an open marriage.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:50.240
Open.

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:51.600
"Open"!

01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:54.040
Free love, swinging…

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.600
-Orgies!
-No!

01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:57.680
No, Gloria. Not like that!

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.280
I never said that.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.280
No, she never said that!

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.320
Stop talking nonsense
and get back to work.

01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:06.800
-Go on. Back to it.
-Sorry.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:07.840
It's fine.

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:10.320
Please excuse him, Mrs. Duvivier.

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.400
He doesn't know
what he's saying and neither do I.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.200
Have a nice day!

01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.720
I hope you have a really nice day!

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.200
You too.

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:25.280
Ciao.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.880
Your boat is lovely, Peter.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:45.000
There's no "Peter" here.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:47.360
It's "Captain."

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.000
-Captain.
-You know…

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.360
After our night at the bar, I had a dream.

01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:56.000
I set sail for new adventures

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.880
with only the ocean
and the dolphins by my side…

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.120
and you, Lily.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.960
But I'm married, Peter.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.880
That's why it was just a dream.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.680
Are you okay?

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.040
Why lie about honeymooning with your mom?

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.120
Who was supposed to come?

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.320
My wife.

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:46.280
Well, the woman who should've been
my wife, but the wedding was called off.

01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:47.960
What happened?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.560
Did she leave you?

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.680
No, it was me.

01:10:54.640 --> 01:10:55.960
I left her because…

01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:59.880
in truth, she's a nice girl,
just really boring.

01:10:59.960 --> 01:11:02.920
-So boring!
-And you were still going to marry her?

01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:05.560
Yes, but I woke up in time.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:08.920
I saw our life in ten years
and realized it'd never work.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.440
Yes, because you need

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:13.760
the unexpected, adventure.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:17.280
-That's right. Life should be exciting.
-Like right now?

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.600
Like right now.

01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.600
Are you okay? What's wrong?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.280
-No, I'm fine.
-Should we stop?

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.400
Absolutely not.

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.560
-Can you see them?
-No.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.880
I can't see any dolphins.

01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.520
They're usually by those rocks over there.

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.120
Can you see them?

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.040
They usually play and frolic
around this time.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.080
-It's lovely to see.
-They're certainly frolicking.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:24.240
-Show me.
-Too late. They're gone.

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:27.440
-Didn't you mention champagne?
-Of course.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.040
Hey, that's Peter's boat.

01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:41.200
Peter?

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.520
I bet he's played
his boat trick on another tourist.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.880
Yep! Bingo!

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.000
Here, have a look.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.360
Oh, right. I see.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.280
That's good champagne.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.080
There's more in the cooler. Help yourself.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.080
He's up for it!

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.520
Holy shit!

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.480
Mom?

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.400
What?

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.040
That's my fucking mother!

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:20.520
Relax. She is allowed to have fun too.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:21.440
No!

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.760
Thanks.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:33.000
Lucas? What are you doing here?

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.840
Bastard! Asshole!

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:37.720
-Lucas! Are you insane?
-Fuck.

01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:40.040
-Have you lost it?
-What's with your husband?

01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:42.320
Don't mock me! And you should be ashamed!

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.640
What do you mean?

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:46.840
Maya and I saw you.
How could you have sex with him?

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:47.800
What?

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.120
Nothing happened--

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.520
-Shut it or you'll get another!
-Hey! Hold on.

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.480
I don't know what you're imagining,
but you're delusional.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:57.800
Delusional? It'll take years
to erase what I saw, Mom.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:59.160
-What?
-My mother su--

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:01.080
Your mother?

01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:04.480
Yes! Married to my father,
who's waiting for her in France.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.960
He's your son?

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.520
Yes. It's complicated.

01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:10.160
He was dumped on his wedding day.
He was so down.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:11.760
So I came.

01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.560
Nice alibi. You just wanted
to screw the first guy you saw!

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:17.560
Listen here, Lucas.

01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.000
If, for once, I actually meet a guy
who's interested in me

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.880
and makes me feel there's more to life

01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.320
than a negligent husband
and a son with no respect,

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.880
I won't automatically sleep with him.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:31.960
Although, right now,
I'm almost regretting that I didn't.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.640
Since you were born,
my life has revolved around you.

01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:38.600
You're 31 and I still wash
your socks and pants.

01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:40.400
I try to solve your problems.

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.160
When you're down,
I go out of my way to console you.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:45.200
What do I get in return? Nothing.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.000
Just criticism.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:48.280
And for once,

01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:50.320
when I can put myself first,

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.840
you show up

01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:54.560
and ruin everything.

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.600
Lily. You little prick.

01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:04.800
Lily.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.360
She's never hit me before.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.360
You asked for it though, didn't you?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:39.520
What if I didn't go back?

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:42.960
There's nothing for me there.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:45.880
We'd be happy here, together.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:50.040
Yeah. We could get a little beach hut,
pop out a couple of kids.

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.480
And get a dog.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.120
Yeah! And you could
keep being a tour guide

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.040
and I'd find a teaching job.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.440
Please say you aren't serious.

01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:06.520
I got carried away, didn't I?

01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.720
We had sex once.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.520
It was good, right?

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:15.480
Yeah, it was good. Great even.

01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.720
It doesn't mean we should be together.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.160
The solution to a breakup
might not be a new relationship.

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.320
It might be your chance to take some time
and take stock, don't you think?

01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.040
I'm afraid of being alone.

01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:45.160
It has its merits.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.400
You should try it.

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.240
I'll look for shells,
give you time to reflect.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:49.360
-Hello?
-Hello, Lucas. Where's your mother?

01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:52.680
-I don't know. Sleeping, I guess.
-Is she okay?

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.880
Because she called me at 3 a.m.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:57.600
I thought she'd decided on a color.

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:59.800
Color? What color?

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.960
She was very upset. She hung up on me.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.960
This morning,
she left me a garbled message,

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:08.720
babbling about the ocean,
boats and dolphins.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.320
-Hold on.
-And some Peter.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.520
Who's this Peter guy?

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:15.400
-Wait, I'll check her room.
-Okay.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.320
Peter…

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.520
Can you put her on?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.000
-Mom?
-Lucas?

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:27.120
Lucas!

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.360
She can't have. No.

01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:31.240
Can't have what?

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.560
She's fucking gone.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:35.600
Aren't you back in two days?

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:37.440
No, she's gone for good.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.120
It's all your fault.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:40.960
But I haven't done anything.

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:43.000
You have. You cheated.

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:45.040
If you knew how long it's been since I…

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.560
No, Dad. Not that!
She told me about when you first met.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:52.480
You'd surprise her, make her laugh,
and then you changed.

01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:56.240
But that's life, Lucas.

01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.360
She isn't always a laugh a minute either.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.880
Really? Because here,
my old man, she's living her best life.

01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.880
Just as well. I'm happy for her.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:07.320
Are you really that blind?
You're losing her.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:10.600
She's bored with you because you're dull.

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:13.000
You're so dull!

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.600
Unbelievably dull.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:18.040
I hope it isn't too late.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.840
If she comes back, make an effort.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.240
A big fucking effort. Okay?

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:38.400
So, you can put your things here.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.680
I'm so happy.

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.760
Right, a quick briefing before we set off.

01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:50.960
There are a few basic
but fundamental rules

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.200
that make boating life a good life.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.240
Okay, Peter.

01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.320
Sorry. Okay, Captain.

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.040
Rule 1: The toilet is only used
in extreme emergencies.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.160
If you need to pee,
do it over the railing.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.720
For a number two, dive into the sea.

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:13.000
Rule 2: Fresh water will not be wasted.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:17.600
Forget about shower gel, shampoo, etc.
We live in harmony with nature.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:22.480
Lastly, but most importantly,
only one person makes the rules. Who?

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:25.440
The captain.

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.000
So, you.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:30.160
Never question his orders.

01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.440
Right. Shall we cast off then?

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.000
-Where is she?
-What the hell? What is this?

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:33.000
-Where is she?
-Who?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.520
Tell me! Where's my mother?

01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:38.160
Mom? Come home.
Dad and I will change, I promise.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.560
-Is that your monkey?
-Yes. He's the only one that stays.

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:50.040
His name is Gizmo.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.720
Where's my mother?

01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:53.880
She had a change of heart.

01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.280
But I don't know why.

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.200
Your mom is an amazing woman.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.480
Before accusing her of being a bad mother,
ask yourself if you're a good son.

01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.560
Sit down.

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.360
I'll take you back.

01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:17.720
Mr. Lucas. Where were you?
We looked everywhere. We're very late.

01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:19.800
-Your wife is already there.
-Where?

01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:22.920
Change into your outfit first.
Follow me, please.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.000
What do you mean, "outfit"? What outfit?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.040
Come on.

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.840
Wait, Gloria. What is this?

01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:36.080
It's a surprise, Mr. Duvivier.

01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:39.760
You're going to remarry your wife,
but the Mauritian way.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.240
-Huh?
-Come on. Vamos.

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.400
Agathe, Raphaël, do you wish to unite
your souls for eternity?

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.720
-We do!
-Wonderful.

01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:50.040
Come on, Lily. Get up there.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:52.120
-Go ahead.
-Next couple, please.

01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:55.040
Congratulations.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.440
-Go on!
-Off you go.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.800
Lily and Lucas,

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.760
do you wish to renew your marriage vows

01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:04.040
and unite your souls for eternity?

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.440
Wait, you can't say yes!

01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:14.320
-Mom, this is ridiculous!
-Mom?

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.360
No, it's a little game we play.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:19.640
-It's…
-Because I'm her son.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:20.720
Her son?

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.680
-What do you mean?
-I'm her son.

01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.760
Her son who never thanked her
for all she does.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.240
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:38.880
For seeing you as a mother,
not as a woman.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.480
For never asking how you are.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:47.200
For never caring about what you wanted
or if you were happy.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:50.680
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.880
Until recently,
I didn't know her likes or desires.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.160
I never showed any interest in her.

01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.280
But she's always there for me.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:10.480
And always will be.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:11.400
Yes.

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:15.120
So, no, she isn't my wife.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:17.360
She's my mom.

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:24.760
I've never told you, Mom.

01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.400
But I love you so much.

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.520
Well said!

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:40.240
My darling boy.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.760
So emotional!

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.200
I can't believe we're leaving tomorrow.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:26.800
Me neither.

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.200
Were you really going to leave with him?

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:36.240
You know what? I'm burning.
I think I've caught the sun again.

01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:38.560
Do you want some cream?

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.520
Oh, what a good son!

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:48.560
May I, sir?

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.360
What beautiful skin.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:06.040
Michel?

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:09.440
-What are you doing here?
-You're so tanned.

01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:11.080
It'd be a pity to lose it.

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:14.000
-Mind if I take her off your hands?
-No.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:16.520
Wait, can you explain?

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:19.920
You can't stay here
because our pilot expects us in an hour.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.480
-Huh?
-I'm taking your mother to Rodrigues.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.880
I've heard it's beautiful.

01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:28.200
It's about time we had our honeymoon,
don't you think?

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.640
Two honeymoons in a row?
Not everyone gets to do that.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.520
Will you be okay on your own?

01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:41.320
Maybe it's time I learned.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:43.520
That's my boy.

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.160
You're amazing.

01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.800
So? Her real husband came back?

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.320
Yes.

01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.600
He's not bad.

01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:05.240
I mean… He's classy.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:06.240
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:07.360
Care to join me?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.720
I have a kayak trip
and my assistant canceled.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.280
-Could you cover for him?
-I'd love to.

01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:23.200
Kayak? A bit boring, isn't it?

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.760
I leave tomorrow.
How about BASE jumping or a bungee jump?

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:28.440
Or swimming with sharks?

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:30.440
You know me. I'm wild.

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:39.400
