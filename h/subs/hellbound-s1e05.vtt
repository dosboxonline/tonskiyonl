WEBVTT

00:12.846 --> 00:14.973
SODO QUICK LOAN

00:16.349 --> 00:18.768
Deacon Yuji, we located Kang Junwon's car.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.939
It was found near a port in Incheon.

00:23.440 --> 00:27.402
He bought cigarettes with his credit card
at a convenience store near the port.

00:27.485 --> 00:30.155
He must have stowed away on a ship.

00:30.238 --> 00:34.325
He borrowed money from loan sharks
and fell into debt because of gambling,

00:34.409 --> 00:37.245
and fled to another country
abandoning his wife and child.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.789
How can he be so irresponsible?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.000
He deserves to be damned.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.170
Deacon Yuji,

00:45.253 --> 00:47.213
we located the sinner, Kim Yeongseok,

00:47.297 --> 00:49.591
who recently received the decree
at a supermarket.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.551
He was hiding in a motel in Cheonan.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.929
Let's head there right now.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
Have a safe trip back.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.909
Does this mean I gave birth to a sinner?

01:16.993 --> 01:17.827
Is that it?

01:18.661 --> 01:20.371
Did I do something wrong?

01:24.209 --> 01:25.627
What should we do?

01:42.685 --> 01:43.645
Junwon.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.564
What's going to happen to you?

01:46.648 --> 01:48.358
What will happen?
What are you going to do?

01:48.441 --> 01:52.654
People from Sodo
will take care of things for me.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.990
They will make it look like
I vanished without a trace.

02:04.749 --> 02:06.042
SODO

02:08.211 --> 02:11.381
A PLACE WHERE RITUALS FOR HEAVENLY GODS
WERE PERFORMED IN THE SAMHAN PERIOD

02:12.257 --> 02:13.925
SODO

02:18.096 --> 02:21.349
RECORDS ON SODO CAN BE FOUND IN HISTORICAL
TEXTS SUCH AS THE BOOK OF THE LATER HAN…

02:25.019 --> 02:28.439
SODO WAS CONSIDERED A SACRED AREA
WHERE RELIGIOUS RITUALS WERE HELD

02:28.523 --> 02:31.609
AND FUGITIVES WHO FLED THERE
WERE IMMUNE TO ARREST

02:35.905 --> 02:36.990
What?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.199
Hey, Producer Bae…

02:39.200 --> 02:40.618
I thought you took a day off.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.036
I did.

02:44.205 --> 02:47.750
Hey, have you heard? About Junwon.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.753
What about him?

02:50.837 --> 02:55.425
It turns out… he was addicted
to gambling and fell into debt.

02:55.508 --> 02:59.220
Rumor has it that he stowed away
on a ship from Incheon to escape the debt.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.599
I never thought
he'd do something like that.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.436
So many people vanish
without a trace these days.

03:09.731 --> 03:12.817
Hey, you don't gamble, do you?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.571
Where are you going?

03:22.368 --> 03:24.746
-Sinner Kim Yeongseok.
-Yes?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.081
Pull yourself together.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.293
Tell us how you received
the decree in detail.

03:30.376 --> 03:33.171
Well, it was…

03:34.505 --> 03:36.716
My wife asked me
to get some groceries for dinner.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.384
I was at a supermarket--

03:38.468 --> 03:41.471
Everyone knows that you received
the decree at a supermarket.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.723
Just tell us when
your demonstration will be held.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.351
That… That is…

03:47.894 --> 03:49.312
I was in the liquor section,

03:51.064 --> 03:53.191
and the angel suddenly appeared before me.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.944
Kim Yeongseok, tell us the time
of your demonstration.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.489
"You will die six days from now…

04:01.866 --> 04:03.368
at 5:00 p.m."

04:03.451 --> 04:06.496
Six days? When would that be?
Isn't that today?

04:07.163 --> 04:08.248
It's happening soon.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.793
Deacons, there isn't much time.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.754
He already confessed his sins.
Please take him away.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.589
Are you going to let it happen here?

04:16.673 --> 04:20.260
The government can't spare more
in the budget for another sacred site.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.637
Okay, we understand. Don't worry.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.181
We'll take him to headquarters
and broadcast his demonstration.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.766
We don't have much time.

04:26.849 --> 04:29.185
Tell headquarters to get ready
for the live broadcast.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.020
Contact the sinner's family too.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.146
Noted, sir.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.274
Get moving.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.650
Sinner Kim Yeongseok.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.990
SODO LAUNDRY SERVICE

04:42.073 --> 04:43.408
Where did you get this?

04:45.076 --> 04:46.077
Hey, Misuk.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.163
Youngjae, have you heard
about Producer Kang?

04:50.081 --> 04:52.166
-The debate show you were working on…
-Sorry?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.960
Some guy was talking
about people vanishing.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.169
Yes, why?

04:55.253 --> 04:56.504
Let me watch the clip again.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.886
The government in our times must
fulfill its role, even as God's tool.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.930
-You have his number, right?
-Yes.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.390
Let me see.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.144
LIST OF CONTACTS
GUEST GONG HYEONGJUN

05:11.227 --> 05:12.145
Thanks, Misuk.

05:56.105 --> 06:02.236
THE NEW TRUTH

06:02.320 --> 06:06.032
DEMONSTRATION IN PROGRESS

06:11.037 --> 06:14.624
The chairman is on his way up.
Camera number two on standby.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.377
Cue.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.440
This sinner, Kim Yeongseok,

06:39.941 --> 06:42.568
has been operating
an illegal gambling house.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.947
He received the decree
in a supermarket in front of everyone.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.537
Even after receiving the decree,

06:53.079 --> 06:56.082
he decided to run away
instead of confessing his sins.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.379
Where did you try to flee to?

07:01.963 --> 07:02.964
To where?!

07:04.924 --> 07:09.345
Did you think you could
deceive God's eyes and run from Him?

07:09.929 --> 07:10.763
Did you?

07:27.738 --> 07:28.573
Look.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.576
Take a good look at your family.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.288
You will now face the demonstration

07:36.289 --> 07:38.541
in front of your family.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.212
And everyone who's watching.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.756
Accept your fate.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.758
All right?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.305
Chairman, we have 30 seconds.

07:58.728 --> 08:03.900
Go to Hell, you sinner!

08:11.407 --> 08:12.783
I can't accept it.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.120
I didn't commit a grave sin.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.830
Honey.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.166
Mom…

08:21.000 --> 08:22.543
I don't sin like that.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.922
Please spare me. Please.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.225
How are the ratings?

09:20.268 --> 09:21.102
One moment.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.021
Real-time viewer ratings
have reached 89.3 percent.

09:31.362 --> 09:32.196
Chairman…

09:32.697 --> 09:34.907
I'd like to call for a committee meeting.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.159
-Is it urgent?
-Yes.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.871
There's an important matter
the committee should address.

09:40.955 --> 09:42.206
All right, then.

09:44.875 --> 09:48.296
I'll call a meeting
as soon as the broadcast ends.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.449
You sinner.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.993
As one who has committed sins,

10:20.119 --> 10:23.456
you shall suffer eternal pain in Hell

10:24.040 --> 10:29.170
and reflect on your sins

10:29.253 --> 10:32.673
over and over again!

10:34.550 --> 10:36.260
May you suffer greatly

10:37.136 --> 10:40.389
in the pain of Hell's inferno.

10:51.067 --> 10:57.031
HANKUK UNIVERSITY
2027 ACADEMIC YEAR KICKOFF CEREMONY

11:11.128 --> 11:13.589
SOCIOLOGY, PROFESSOR GONG HYEONGJUN

11:28.729 --> 11:29.939
What is this?

11:30.022 --> 11:31.190
What a pain in the ass.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.359
-Let go of me!
-Producer Bae.

11:35.319 --> 11:39.156
Didn't I tell you to forget about
what you witnessed yesterday?

11:44.495 --> 11:45.996
If you tell us now,

11:47.123 --> 11:49.959
we won't make your daughter
witness your demonstration.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.296
Your daughter would love
to see you being torn to pieces.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.297
Sir…

11:56.257 --> 11:58.467
My daughter is still too young.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.844
Spit it out now.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.763
Well…

12:04.390 --> 12:06.517
The video of me receiving the decree

12:06.600 --> 12:08.894
went viral online so fast.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.813
So I decided to run away.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
I don't know how they found me,

12:13.315 --> 12:14.734
but I got a call from them.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.862
Who are you referring to?

12:17.945 --> 12:19.864
The rumored organization…

12:22.116 --> 12:26.328
that helps those who received the decree
vanish before the New Truth finds them.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
What did they say?

12:28.414 --> 12:34.128
They told me that they could help me
disappear without anyone knowing.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.671
So I told them

12:36.422 --> 12:37.923
I would think about it.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.009
Then a little later,

12:41.010 --> 12:44.972
I found that business card
in this motel room.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.640
SODO LAUNDRY SERVICE

12:46.724 --> 12:47.683
The New Truth claims

12:47.767 --> 12:49.977
that only sinners are subjected
to the demonstration,

12:50.060 --> 12:51.645
but that's a lie.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.399
It is more like a supernatural disaster
that cannot be explained.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.902
Jung Jinsu simply gave meaning
to this random event

12:57.985 --> 12:59.570
by calling it God's will.

13:00.154 --> 13:01.071
So…

13:02.615 --> 13:05.618
are you saying you're hiding
those who received the decree?

13:05.701 --> 13:06.577
Yes.

13:06.660 --> 13:09.288
It's to prevent the New Truth
from getting what they want

13:09.371 --> 13:11.791
and to protect the bereaved
from being stigmatized.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.835
That's the best we can do for them
at this point.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.254
How do you find people
who receive the decree?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.298
We can't find all of them.

13:19.381 --> 13:22.760
It's easy to identify those
who received the decree in public.

13:23.761 --> 13:26.639
In that case, we need to find them
before the New Truth does.

13:26.722 --> 13:29.350
On the other hand, those
who receive the decree in private

13:29.433 --> 13:31.018
show similar behavioral patterns.

13:31.101 --> 13:34.104
For example, the things they search for
after receiving the decree.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.151
They repeatedly search
for certain terms on the New Truth app

13:39.235 --> 13:42.446
and once we notice the pattern,
we try to get in contact with them.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.115
How is that even possible?

13:45.616 --> 13:48.744
We use the backdoor
the New Truth has planted.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.372
Our members are everywhere.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.124
The police, telecomm groups,
search engine companies…

13:55.584 --> 13:57.419
Even at your TV station.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.880
There are some
who engage in illegal activities.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.299
Most of them are family of the subjects

14:02.383 --> 14:04.343
or hold a grudge against the Arrowhead.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.889
Isn't it a bit too dangerous?

14:11.016 --> 14:13.394
Half the world
are followers of the New Truth.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.692
What do you think Chairman Kim Jeongchil
would do if he receives the decree?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.945
He would turn to us first.

14:23.612 --> 14:27.157
Once the tables are turned
and you become the one being judged,

14:28.242 --> 14:29.660
you realize that humans

14:31.120 --> 14:33.122
should have the right to die alone.

14:48.470 --> 14:53.142
Song Sohyun's baby.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.646
In three days,

14:58.856 --> 15:03.903
at 9:30 p.m.…

15:03.986 --> 15:06.864
-Please help me.
-…you are bound for Hell.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.702
I was going to call that woman
some time today.

15:12.328 --> 15:13.412
That woman?

15:14.413 --> 15:16.373
I'm sure you've heard of her.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.586
Her name is Min Hyejin.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.592
The Min Hyejin that he mentioned

15:27.635 --> 15:31.180
is the lawyer who was hostile
toward the New Truth.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.932
She went missing a few years ago.

15:33.807 --> 15:39.229
She was working
at Sodo Law Firm during that time.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.318
Okay.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.905
Yes, noted.

15:50.491 --> 15:52.660
There is someone who'd like to meet you.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.536
Please come with me.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.290
Sodo…

15:58.374 --> 15:59.959
We thought it was just a rumor,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.003
but it turns out Sodo is the organization

16:03.087 --> 16:06.006
that hides those who receive the decree.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.257
And…

16:09.301 --> 16:12.179
Producer Kang Junwon,
who's known to have fled the country.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.516
I believe he is a sinner
who received the decree.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.185
I'm sure Sodo covered it up.

16:19.061 --> 16:23.065
Have you tried calling the numbers here?

16:23.148 --> 16:24.566
Yes, we have.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.861
They're temporary numbers generated online
and none of them are active.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.451
This is blasphemy!

16:37.287 --> 16:41.166
This is an act of rebellion against God
with an intention to incapacitate Him.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.961
They are getting in the way
of the betterment of humanity.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.797
It's an act of betrayal against humanity.

16:47.965 --> 16:50.509
Apprehend every single
one of them right now.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.928
-Take strong and swift measures.
-Yes, sir.

16:53.762 --> 16:56.223
I'll request police cooperation
and call deacons--

16:56.306 --> 16:57.975
What are you talking about?

16:58.058 --> 17:01.437
We don't have time to make
formal requests from law enforcement.

17:02.521 --> 17:06.066
Why do you think
they are always a step ahead of us?

17:06.650 --> 17:09.111
It's because we always abide by the law

17:09.194 --> 17:11.697
while they don't give a damn about it!

17:11.780 --> 17:15.492
This is not the time to think about
what's legal and what's not.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.746
Do whatever it takes to round them up.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.083
Chairman.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.794
That is beyond my authority.

17:35.929 --> 17:38.140
Deacon Yuji, come here.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.312
Come closer.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.448
Deacon Yuji…

17:56.325 --> 17:58.994
with the power given to me
as chairman of the New Truth,

17:59.661 --> 18:04.792
as of this moment,
I empower you with the full authority

18:05.584 --> 18:09.338
to take all necessary measures

18:09.421 --> 18:11.381
to root out the unjust who deny God.

18:15.844 --> 18:18.180
I empower you!

18:23.477 --> 18:26.146
Devote your body and soul

18:27.439 --> 18:30.234
to following God's will.

18:55.092 --> 18:59.513
Hey, can we please come up
with something better for this ritual?

19:00.013 --> 19:03.308
Something that looks
more impressive and phenomenal.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.019
Well… I'll think of something.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.563
Sure, please do.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.690
My goodness.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.821
Are you all right?

19:17.364 --> 19:18.365
Deacon Sacheong.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.449
Yes.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.578
Contact the Arrowhead and find out
how many we can muster right now.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.079
Sorry? The Arrowhead?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.372
How would I…

19:27.791 --> 19:29.459
I know you are in contact with them.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.672
You do not need to be secretive this time.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.508
Yes, sir.

19:44.933 --> 19:45.893
Hey, it's me.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.228
How many can you gather right now?

19:50.647 --> 19:51.481
So…

19:54.610 --> 19:58.739
you're saying those monsters
have nothing to do with God's will, right?

20:02.618 --> 20:06.246
Do you really believe that nonsense?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.123
Then what about the decree?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.920
Those monsters call them by name,
claiming they're bound for Hell.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.715
Well, we don't know
whether or not it's God's work.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.177
The problem is that the New Truth
has the exclusive right

20:20.260 --> 20:22.721
to dictate how this phenomenon
should be interpreted.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.641
If all this is God's work,

20:26.141 --> 20:28.894
and His will really is
what the New Truth says it is,

20:28.977 --> 20:30.771
we have no choice but to deny God

20:30.854 --> 20:33.398
because that means
He doesn't care for us humans.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.949
This is just a disaster,
like an earthquake or an accident.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.327
It's a misfortune that can befall anyone.

20:45.410 --> 20:48.372
It's not about punishing
or being punished.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.959
Your baby has no sin.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.920
That's a fact nobody can deny.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.666
Thanks for coming, Mr. Bae.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.251
I'm Min Hyejin.

22:17.627 --> 22:18.754
Please come in.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.455
What kind of person leaves their engine
running in a parking lot?

23:02.047 --> 23:03.048
Sujeong.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.717
I'm home!

23:09.554 --> 23:10.555
Sujeong!

23:13.392 --> 23:15.227
What's all this, you fuckers?

23:32.452 --> 23:33.286
Shut up!

23:34.704 --> 23:36.081
He's not dead yet.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.461
Wake that asshole up!

23:42.045 --> 23:43.046
Bring a chair.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.631
Hey, wake up.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.217
Where did you get the information?

23:47.300 --> 23:50.387
There's a member of the Arrowhead
who's a detective at Mapo Police Station.

23:50.470 --> 23:53.723
He said some loan sharks
threatened Kang Junwon's wife

23:53.807 --> 23:55.475
a few days before he disappeared.

23:56.059 --> 23:59.104
What they did to collect the debt
was not necessarily illegal,

23:59.187 --> 24:01.106
so they were let go after questioning.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.360
It's obvious they did that to hide
Kang Junwon's demonstration.

24:06.736 --> 24:08.321
He must be a family member of a sinner.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.282
Yes, he's the son of sinner number 16.

24:10.365 --> 24:13.535
His mother loaned money
to market vendors at high interest.

24:13.618 --> 24:14.661
I mean…

24:14.744 --> 24:17.164
I can't believe he still
hasn't come to his senses,

24:17.247 --> 24:19.499
even after seeing his mother
damned to Hell.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.754
We need to come up with a better program
to reform the children of sinners.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.593
He's just a loan shark
and no one would care if he dies.

24:30.760 --> 24:31.845
How pathetic.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.557
We've confirmed the situation you are in.

24:36.266 --> 24:39.060
The surveillance footage from
the hospital has been deleted as well.

24:39.728 --> 24:40.687
Help yourself.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.234
Even if the New Truth finds out,

24:46.318 --> 24:48.528
they'll try to hide
your baby's demonstration

24:48.612 --> 24:50.822
because it would not benefit
them in any way.

24:51.656 --> 24:55.160
They could make it look like you
and your wife murdered the baby.

24:55.952 --> 24:59.372
Or they might even try to hide
the fact that your baby was ever born.

25:01.041 --> 25:04.753
There's no concept of original sin or
redemption in their doctrine. Therefore,

25:05.879 --> 25:09.299
they'll never admit that a newborn baby
can be subjected to the demonstration.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.010
You can never be sure, can you?

25:14.221 --> 25:16.806
They can simply modify
their doctrine to fit their needs.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.810
It may not seem like it,
but they have clear standards

25:20.894 --> 25:22.562
on what they declare to be sins.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.189
That's right.

25:25.607 --> 25:28.443
Only acts that can be prevented
by human effort are considered sins.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.238
As she said, there's no concept
of original sin and redemption.

25:31.321 --> 25:33.365
They don't consider
lust or greed to be sins either.

25:33.865 --> 25:37.410
If they cross that line, some find it hard
to understand and live by the doctrine.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.411
Goodness.

25:38.495 --> 25:41.998
A perfect world where no one commits
even the most trivial acts of evil.

25:42.082 --> 25:45.043
By making that unrealistic goal
look achievable,

25:45.126 --> 25:48.547
they're trying to make people keep an eye
on each other and condemn others.

25:48.630 --> 25:51.967
The fear and catharsis the demonstrations
provide are what drives their system.

25:52.551 --> 25:56.638
That's why they need sinners they can
make an example of on a regular basis.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.349
They'd manipulate a case
that doesn't align with their doctrine,

25:59.432 --> 26:01.977
and even come up with one
if there's no case that fits.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.772
Have they ever concealed a case?

26:07.482 --> 26:09.818
The one who started all this and vanished.

26:10.485 --> 26:13.071
Where do you think
Chairman Jung Jinsu is right now?

26:15.031 --> 26:16.908
I heard he's traveling the world.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.867
He's dead.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.831
He was subjected to the demonstration
somewhere four years ago.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.500
He was subjected to the demonstration?

26:29.087 --> 26:31.089
Are you saying he came up
with false doctrine

26:31.172 --> 26:32.882
after receiving the decree himself?

26:33.466 --> 26:35.135
-Why would he do that?
-Who knows?

26:36.344 --> 26:39.055
Living for 20 years
knowing that your days are numbered

26:39.139 --> 26:42.183
can make you do all sorts
of crazy things, don't you think?

26:44.019 --> 26:46.563
Since he had those 20 years to live,

26:47.147 --> 26:50.317
he was able to prepare
interpretations of this phenomenon.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.528
Then let the world know.
What are you doing now?

26:53.612 --> 26:57.657
Jung Jinsu warned people about this
for over ten years,

26:57.741 --> 27:01.786
but people didn't listen to him
until they witnessed the demonstration

27:01.870 --> 27:03.788
of Ms. Park Jungja with their own eyes.

27:07.375 --> 27:10.045
In order to get people to listen to us,

27:11.254 --> 27:13.340
we need a Ms. Park too.

27:15.467 --> 27:16.509
What are you saying?

27:20.180 --> 27:22.515
What are you trying to say right now?

27:23.725 --> 27:26.770
We want to broadcast
your baby's demonstration live.

27:35.528 --> 27:36.529
I should go.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.157
Wait, Mr. Bae.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.158
What?

27:42.118 --> 27:44.954
An innocent newborn received the decree.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.625
We have to show it to the people
so that we can take the world back.

27:48.708 --> 27:50.418
Do I look like I care?

27:50.919 --> 27:53.296
Do I? What does that have to do with me?

27:53.380 --> 27:56.216
Do you think I asked for your help
to save the fucking world?

27:57.425 --> 28:01.179
All I want is to protect my family,
all right?

28:02.180 --> 28:04.391
You should fucking know better
when to blabber bullshit.

28:04.474 --> 28:06.267
Why bring me here in this cold weather?

28:07.352 --> 28:09.354
My baby is going to die!

28:11.189 --> 28:13.566
My newborn baby received the decree!

28:14.901 --> 28:16.403
Damn it…

28:16.903 --> 28:20.281
How are you any different
from the New Truth?

28:21.032 --> 28:24.202
You think this is your chance
to back up your nonsense? Huh?

28:25.495 --> 28:28.498
You're only trying to use
my baby's death for your own benefit.

28:29.082 --> 28:32.252
You're no different than those bastards!

28:32.752 --> 28:33.920
Damn it.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.970
We'll disguise your poor baby's death,
who was born into this shitty world,

28:42.637 --> 28:44.264
as an accident, then.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.350
We'll make sure that your baby
dies a meaningless death,

28:47.851 --> 28:51.146
so you just carry on shooting
documentaries for the New Truth.

28:53.189 --> 28:55.525
We'll do whatever you ask us to do.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.861
Call us when you make up your mind.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.742
Come on, let's go.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.257
Listen.

29:20.091 --> 29:23.636
Whenever you are ready to talk,
open your hands. Got it?

29:36.024 --> 29:39.068
You really know
how to take blows, don't you?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.739
Hold this.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.993
Or should I play with your wife?

29:48.077 --> 29:49.621
Please don't kill me.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.583
Sujeong! No!

29:53.666 --> 29:55.126
She's not a sinner.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.254
She doesn't even know
what her husband does for a living.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.131
Ignorance is a sin.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.594
-Hey! Stop!
-Should I draw something on her face?

30:04.677 --> 30:05.804
Hey!

30:09.516 --> 30:10.892
It might hurt a lot.

30:11.893 --> 30:13.770
Hey, he opened his hands.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.523
You did the right thing. It's okay.

30:19.526 --> 30:20.443
He gave us a name.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.362
-A professor at Hankuk University.
-Yes.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.489
-Ask them to track his location.
-Okay.

30:32.205 --> 30:35.291
Ms. Min must be in a bad mood
because of today's live broadcast.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.795
It's the first time
that we failed to protect

30:39.462 --> 30:41.297
a person we got in touch with first.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.926
Did you see the scar on her forehead?

30:46.177 --> 30:49.138
She got that when she was attacked
by Kim Jeongchil and the Arrowhead.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.266
She almost died,

30:51.891 --> 30:54.143
but she was saved
by the sirens of a police car.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.772
The Arrowhead punks
weren't as reckless as they are now,

30:58.314 --> 31:01.109
so she managed to survive. But…

31:02.068 --> 31:04.529
she's angrier at herself than at them.

31:05.655 --> 31:08.700
She regrets that she couldn't stop
the live broadcast of Ms. Park.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.621
And that she failed to see
what Jung Jinsu was up to.

31:14.372 --> 31:15.415
She blames herself.

31:16.249 --> 31:19.335
She feels responsible
for how the world turned out.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.088
That's why she's so eager

31:22.672 --> 31:25.300
to hold on to the opportunity
to make up for her mistakes.

31:26.426 --> 31:29.721
She wants to atone for her mistakes.

31:32.932 --> 31:33.975
I'll give you a ride.

31:34.684 --> 31:35.768
No, thank you.

31:38.229 --> 31:39.355
My daughter

31:40.064 --> 31:41.274
received the decree too.

31:46.112 --> 31:48.865
Out of the blue,
she said she wanted to see the ocean.

31:58.499 --> 32:02.295
Wow. How did you find this place?

32:05.715 --> 32:07.675
Is this where you used to come with Mom?

32:08.176 --> 32:09.093
-Is it?
-What?

32:09.177 --> 32:12.805
-It's a secret.
-Gong Yeonjae.

32:12.889 --> 32:17.352
You are bound for Hell

32:17.435 --> 32:21.689
in 30 seconds.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.984
I'll never forget the look on her face

32:26.361 --> 32:28.279
during those 30 seconds.

32:29.822 --> 32:32.742
It seemed like she wanted me
to explain what was going on.

32:53.930 --> 32:54.889
Dad.

32:56.140 --> 32:57.433
Help me.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.770
Yeonjae!

33:20.081 --> 33:21.666
Do you know

33:22.834 --> 33:26.587
how I felt looking at her body
after it had been cruelly torn apart?

33:30.591 --> 33:31.634
I was relieved…

33:34.804 --> 33:36.514
that no one witnessed it.

33:40.935 --> 33:43.855
That's how I felt in that horrific moment.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.150
Mr. Bae…

33:48.526 --> 33:51.612
would you say my daughter's death
was an accident or an act of judgment?

33:55.408 --> 33:58.286
I consider my daughter's death
a terrible accident.

34:00.204 --> 34:01.789
I want to grieve this misfortune

34:03.082 --> 34:06.794
as simply that…
a misfortune, nothing else.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.715
I'm sorry

34:11.591 --> 34:14.093
that such misfortune
has befallen your family.

34:15.845 --> 34:19.348
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this first.

35:17.115 --> 35:19.492
Come here.

35:20.868 --> 35:22.328
What's wrong?

36:07.331 --> 36:08.791
JUDGMENT

36:10.751 --> 36:11.586
Hey.

36:12.086 --> 36:13.087
It's him, right?

36:14.088 --> 36:15.047
Is he dead?

36:15.965 --> 36:17.091
Break the window.

36:22.889 --> 36:25.558
Come out.

36:42.325 --> 36:43.409
Youngjae.

36:44.452 --> 36:48.164
You saw my mom at my dad's funeral, right?

36:50.875 --> 36:54.503
You know, she cheated on my dad
and left me when I was five.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.049
After he died,

36:59.592 --> 37:01.802
I called her and waited for her to come.

37:04.805 --> 37:06.349
You know what I imagined?

37:09.477 --> 37:11.395
I thought she would hold my hand…

37:13.856 --> 37:15.441
and tell me that she was sorry.

37:16.817 --> 37:18.361
And that she missed me.

37:19.528 --> 37:21.948
I thought she would cry
and beg for my forgiveness.

37:24.909 --> 37:27.203
Then I would pretend
to resent her for a bit…

37:29.705 --> 37:31.999
and cry my eyes out in her arms.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.088
That's what I thought it'd be like.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.132
But you know what she said?

37:42.426 --> 37:44.053
She said she was so out of it

37:45.805 --> 37:47.640
when she was divorcing my dad,

37:48.140 --> 37:50.518
and she didn't get enough alimony.

37:54.146 --> 37:56.440
She asked me how much Dad left for me.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.820
She insisted on receiving her share.

38:03.197 --> 38:05.366
She hadn't seen me for 30 years,

38:07.868 --> 38:11.414
but she didn't even ask me how I had been.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.835
Not all mothers are good mothers.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.714
What's the point of resenting her now?

38:21.424 --> 38:22.842
You're right.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.555
But why does it have to be my mom?

38:29.098 --> 38:31.309
Why does such a horrible person
have to be my mom?

38:33.519 --> 38:35.688
I told myself every day
after I got pregnant

38:36.731 --> 38:38.232
that I would be like

38:40.151 --> 38:42.862
those loving mothers in TV dramas

38:44.655 --> 38:46.365
because I'm different from my mom.

38:48.701 --> 38:52.872
I wanted our baby
to grow up feeling loved.

38:54.540 --> 38:57.043
I wanted our baby
to live an ordinary life.

39:02.757 --> 39:04.050
But now,

39:07.595 --> 39:09.138
I find that thing horrendous.

39:12.475 --> 39:14.852
What kind of evil
resides in that little thing?

39:17.063 --> 39:19.774
Why would it receive the decree
as soon as it is born?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.740
Youngjae, I must be losing my mind.

39:31.035 --> 39:34.580
I can't stop thinking about it.

39:35.915 --> 39:37.458
And every time I do,

39:39.377 --> 39:42.004
I can't help but resent myself.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.552
Sohyun.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.182
I met some people.

39:56.811 --> 39:57.812
They said…

39:59.814 --> 40:02.316
they'd like to broadcast
our baby's demonstration.

40:04.485 --> 40:05.403
What?

40:06.529 --> 40:08.614
Since our baby has no sin…

40:10.991 --> 40:12.410
they said they can prove…

40:16.038 --> 40:19.291
that the New Truth is lying
if they broadcast the demonstration.

40:23.546 --> 40:25.005
That's what they suggested.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.843
What if we don't agree to it?

40:29.718 --> 40:32.138
They'll disguise
our baby's death as an accident.

40:33.722 --> 40:35.224
It's our choice to make.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.489
It's okay. We have a lot of time.

40:53.033 --> 40:56.620
I'm sure you'll tell us
everything eventually.

40:59.832 --> 41:01.542
Hey, that bastard's awake.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.004
You, check up on him.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.507
Professor!

41:09.633 --> 41:10.968
You bastards.

41:11.051 --> 41:13.304
You're finally up, Professor Gong.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.264
You fanatical bastards.

41:16.515 --> 41:17.349
Fine.

41:18.184 --> 41:19.018
Go ahead.

41:19.518 --> 41:20.769
Go ahead!

41:22.605 --> 41:26.984
We're not going to ask you anything,
so don't get your hopes up.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.696
We're getting enough information from him.

41:35.910 --> 41:36.952
Hyeongjun.

41:37.036 --> 41:37.995
Geunbae.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.540
You fucking bastards.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.919
He knows nothing. Nothing!

41:45.002 --> 41:46.504
Just ask me the questions.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.631
Shut the hell up!

41:49.423 --> 41:52.551
You don't need to say a word.

41:53.219 --> 41:54.512
What we need…

41:58.098 --> 41:59.391
is this guy

42:00.392 --> 42:01.519
and your car.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.313
We just need the records
from your navigation system

42:04.396 --> 42:06.440
that show us where you've been.

42:07.441 --> 42:08.275
What?

42:09.860 --> 42:11.737
Hold on. Wait a second.

42:12.321 --> 42:13.489
Execute him.

42:14.490 --> 42:16.242
Wait. Hold on!

42:16.325 --> 42:18.118
-What are you doing?
-Untie me, bastards!

42:18.702 --> 42:19.954
Untie me! Now!

42:20.037 --> 42:21.247
Hey, listen to me.

42:21.830 --> 42:22.831
Come on!

42:23.332 --> 42:25.876
You can kill me,
so just hear me out for a second.

42:25.960 --> 42:26.794
No! Fuck!

42:26.877 --> 42:27.878
Hey, listen.

42:27.962 --> 42:29.880
-Hyeongjun!
-You're being deceived.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.173
You bastards!

42:31.257 --> 42:33.217
-You're being deceived.
-Stop, you bastards!

42:33.300 --> 42:36.512
By Kim Jeongchil and Jung Jinsu.

42:37.096 --> 42:38.097
You bastards.

42:38.180 --> 42:40.683
I don't care if I die,
but hear me out for a second!

42:40.766 --> 42:42.142
Hear me out.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.227
-Hey!
-Hyeongjun!

42:43.310 --> 42:46.355
-You idiots! Hear me out!
-Goodbye. Close it.

42:46.438 --> 42:47.898
Let Geunbae go!

42:47.982 --> 42:49.358
You bastards!

42:49.441 --> 42:51.527
Listen to me!

43:22.099 --> 43:25.811
Your call cannot be connected.
Please try again…

43:50.127 --> 43:52.296
Everyone out. Search thoroughly!

44:03.223 --> 44:04.725
Get moving!

44:06.352 --> 44:07.770
Deacon Sacheong.

44:08.354 --> 44:10.898
You can't be seen
with the Arrowhead in your uniform.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.400
Oh, right.

44:16.779 --> 44:17.905
Those bastards…

44:19.990 --> 44:21.075
Run!

44:27.748 --> 44:29.458
Search thoroughly from here.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.584
Yes, sir!

44:40.094 --> 44:40.928
Damn it!

44:44.348 --> 44:46.684
-Over here! She's going upstairs!
-Run!

44:48.060 --> 44:50.270
-The stairs are here.
-Hurry!

44:50.354 --> 44:51.230
Go up!

44:51.313 --> 44:52.398
Hey, over there!

44:52.481 --> 44:53.565
Get her!

44:53.649 --> 44:54.608
Where?

44:55.693 --> 44:57.236
This way, you idiot!

45:00.906 --> 45:02.950
What incompetent people.

45:05.953 --> 45:07.246
Those idiots.

45:07.746 --> 45:09.832
I told you she went this way!

45:09.915 --> 45:12.334
-Get moving!
-You idiots!

45:24.304 --> 45:25.264
Get her!

45:37.109 --> 45:38.026
Come on!

46:13.353 --> 46:14.813
Get her!

46:16.023 --> 46:17.024
Where is she?

46:29.912 --> 46:30.829
Damn.

46:31.371 --> 46:33.248
Get up. Get on your feet, now!

46:33.332 --> 46:35.501
Nice to meet you, Ms. Min Hyejin.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.345
-Hey!
-Over there!

46:49.890 --> 46:51.225
-What happened?
-Are you okay?

46:52.017 --> 46:53.060
-What?
-What happened?

46:53.143 --> 46:54.061
Go after her.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.313
-Are you all right?
-Where did she go?

46:56.396 --> 46:57.564
-Go find her!
-Sir!

47:18.669 --> 47:23.882
KIM GEUNBAE, A SINNER WHO DENIED GOD
GONG HYEONGJUN, A SINNER WHO DENIED GOD

48:37.205 --> 48:38.457
Breaking news.

48:38.540 --> 48:43.211
A police investigation is underway
after two burnt bodies were found

48:43.295 --> 48:45.255
at the main gate of Hankuk University.

48:45.339 --> 48:48.216
Our reporter at the scene
has more details.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.302
Over to our reporter.

48:50.385 --> 48:51.595
At around 6:00 a.m. today,

48:51.678 --> 48:55.933
two heavily burned bodies were found
at the front gate of Hankuk University,

48:56.016 --> 48:57.976
causing massive shock to the public.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.686
One of the bodies is presumed to be

48:59.770 --> 49:03.231
that of Professor Gong Hyeongjun
who was a professor at the university.

49:03.315 --> 49:05.525
The police have opened
an investigation into the matter.

49:06.193 --> 49:10.781
Professor Gong had recently appeared
on various current affairs programs

49:10.864 --> 49:16.578
and had been gaining prominence,
making his death more shocking.

49:17.496 --> 49:20.958
The bodies were too heavily damaged
to be identified.

49:21.041 --> 49:25.087
But because of the signs
hung around their necks,

49:25.170 --> 49:28.966
police presume them to be
Professor Gong and Mr. Kim.

49:29.049 --> 49:31.760
An extensive investigation
into the matter has begun.

49:32.594 --> 49:35.472
The sinner, Gong Hyeongjun,
had been leading a double life

49:35.555 --> 49:37.849
and operating a secret organization
called Sodo.

49:37.933 --> 49:41.311
He had been hiding those
who received the decree.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.523
He disguised God's demonstrations
as mere accidents

49:45.023 --> 49:48.652
and twisted God's message to humans.

49:49.820 --> 49:54.074
We, the Arrowhead, have brought
God's judgment upon him.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.619
The New Truth and everyone
watching this must take heed of us.

49:57.703 --> 50:00.872
Those who deny God and distort His message

50:00.956 --> 50:02.749
must be punished for their actions.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.253
We, the Arrowhead,
have confirmed that the head of Sodo,

50:06.336 --> 50:08.630
the secret organization that denies God,

50:08.714 --> 50:13.468
is Min Hyejin who used to be a lawyer
at Sodo Law Firm.

50:18.223 --> 50:21.309
SODO REAL ESTATE

50:29.151 --> 50:29.985
Hello?

50:30.068 --> 50:31.236
Have you seen the news?

50:31.737 --> 50:33.488
Yes. Are you all right?

50:33.989 --> 50:35.699
Have you talked to your wife?

50:36.867 --> 50:38.910
Yes, but we haven't made a decision yet.

50:39.411 --> 50:41.872
As you already know,
we don't have much time.

50:41.955 --> 50:45.250
We may not be able to help you
if you do not make a decision soon.

50:45.333 --> 50:46.585
Where are you right now?

50:46.668 --> 50:48.211
Well, I'm at work.

50:48.920 --> 50:50.505
What about your wife and baby?

50:51.757 --> 50:52.716
They're at home.

50:52.799 --> 50:56.178
You should've stayed with them,
considering how serious the situation is.

50:57.345 --> 50:59.014
Are you sure they're at home?

51:29.002 --> 51:32.506
THE NEW TRUTH
