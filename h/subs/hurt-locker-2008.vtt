It's going to do some fucking damage.
Okay.

SANBORN: Hey, Eldridge,
looks like we're going to need a charge.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.500
ELDRIDGE: Oh, I got that.

03:29.585 --> 03:33.129
I figured four blocks, that'll give us
about 20 pounds of bang, total.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.132
That blast is going to roll straight out there.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.134
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

03:38.218 --> 03:40.761
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

03:40.846 --> 03:41.929
Yeah.

03:42.598 --> 03:44.932
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,

03:45.017 --> 03:47.018
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee.

-No problem.

this beautiful neighborhood?

04:53.210 --> 04:54.710
Oh, I love it.

So, if everything looks okay
when I get down there,

Get out of the car!

20:25.975 --> 20:28.143
What the fuck are you doing?

20:31.272 --> 20:32.480
Back up.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.652
Hello?

20:38.613 --> 20:40.363
(MAN SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

20:52.793 --> 20:54.419
Want to get back?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.189
Shit.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.275
It's that way.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.031
Back.

21:24.158 --> 21:28.119
SOLDIER: Three, four rounds fired. The nine
is now pressing into the haji's forehead.

21:43.219 --> 21:45.804
-Taxi's moving.
-Eldridge, get him out of here. Come on.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.682
-Get him out of the car!
-Stop! Stop the car!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.643
Get out of the fucking car!

21:51.727 --> 21:54.354
Get on the ground! On the ground!

21:54.438 --> 21:56.564
-Get down there.
-Stay down.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.319
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.404
(LAUGHING)

22:02.488 --> 22:04.739
Roger that. That's real funny.

22:59.462 --> 23:01.087
Found something.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.516
Hello, baby.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.341
Got you.

24:01.023 --> 24:02.315
All right.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.491
All right. We're done. Good to go.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.537
-Good to go.
-Come down, Specialist.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.164
Roger.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.343
(GRUNTING)

24:32.054 --> 24:35.723
Uh, got a wire. Hang on.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.898
Where are you going?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.832
-Secondary.
-Shit.

25:00.916 --> 25:03.835
Take cover. Get in the wall. Get in the wall.

25:19.059 --> 25:20.310
Oh, boy.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.313
(EXHALING)

26:47.690 --> 26:49.482
That wasn't so bad.
First time working together.

26:49.566 --> 26:50.566
What do you think?

26:50.651 --> 26:56.364
Hmm, I think us working together
means I talk to you

26:56.448 --> 27:00.201
-and you talk to me.
-We going on a date, Sanborn?

27:00.536 --> 27:04.372
No. We're going on a mission,
and my job is to keep you safe,

27:04.456 --> 27:07.917
-so we can keep going on missions.
-It's combat, buddy.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.885
Hey. It's just 39 days.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.179
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.575
Hey, it's Mr. Be All You Can Be.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.786
-What's up, Doc?
-Not much. How are you?

27:44.705 --> 27:48.958
I'm good.
Got a question about that song, though,

27:49.752 --> 27:51.461
Be All You Can Be.

27:51.879 --> 27:55.006
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

27:55.090 --> 27:58.051
I mean, I think it's logical. This is a war.

27:59.136 --> 28:01.679
People die all the time. Why not me?

28:03.098 --> 28:04.349
You got to change the record in your head.

28:04.433 --> 28:06.184
You gotta start thinking about other things.

28:06.268 --> 28:10.355
Okay. Stop obsessing.
Right now, what are you thinking about?

28:10.439 --> 28:11.814
You want to know
what I'm thinking about, Doc?

28:11.899 --> 28:14.817
-Yeah.
-This is what I'm thinking about, Doc.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.780
Here's Thompson, okay. He's dead.

28:18.864 --> 28:19.864
(GUN CLICKS)

28:20.199 --> 28:21.199
He's alive.

28:21.784 --> 28:24.494
Here's Thompson. He's dead. He's alive.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.663
He's dead. He's alive.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.171
Yo, what's up, my nigger? What's up, man?
What's up?

28:35.255 --> 28:37.173
You cool? Come on.
You want the cool shit?

28:37.257 --> 28:39.217
Man, come on, come on.
It's the tight shit, man. Come on.

28:39.301 --> 28:43.721
Wanna buy DVDs? Wanna buy DVD?
Fuck you. Come, come, please, please.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.306
New releases. Look.

28:45.391 --> 28:48.267
Hey. Hello, hello. Want to buy DVDs?
Very good. Very good.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.269
-How much?
-One for 5 and two for 9.

28:50.354 --> 28:53.689
-Three for 12.
-Three for 13, and I don't give you tax.

28:53.774 --> 28:56.692
-Very good, man. Look.
-No tax?

28:56.777 --> 28:58.194
All right. What do you got?
What do you got?

28:58.278 --> 29:01.572
You know, you smart shit.
You not like those stupid fuck-face...

29:01.657 --> 29:03.574
Yeah, I'm a smart guy, huh?

29:04.118 --> 29:07.412
You're a smart kid.
Give me your best one, okay?

29:07.496 --> 29:09.914
-Here, this the best one.
-This is a good one?

29:09.998 --> 29:14.043
-Yes. The best shit, man.
-Okay. Here you go. I'll take one.

29:14.128 --> 29:15.628
-Keep the change.
-Thank you.

29:15.712 --> 29:19.173
Want a cigarette? Get out of here.
You shouldn't smoke.

29:21.260 --> 29:23.219
Thank you. Take it easy.

29:28.809 --> 29:32.728
I need to talk to you about something
before we go out again.

29:32.813 --> 29:34.188
What's that?

29:35.649 --> 29:37.400
-Yesterday.
-Mmm-hmm.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.361
Wasn't cool.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.866
Yeah, I know. You'll get it, though.
You'll get it.

29:47.578 --> 29:50.204
-So, you're a ranger, huh?
-Yeah.

29:50.998 --> 29:54.417
I was in Intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD.

29:55.627 --> 29:59.755
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

30:02.009 --> 30:06.762
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out
a redneck piece of trailer trash like you.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.516
Looks like you're on the right track.

30:11.768 --> 30:13.895
See you out there, man.

30:21.278 --> 30:23.070
(SHOUTING IN ARABIC)

30:23.989 --> 30:25.364
Come on, let's go. Move it. Move it.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.992
(SPEAKING ARABIC OVER LOUDSPEAKER)

30:31.955 --> 30:34.624
SANBORN: Shit. Get out of the way. Move.

30:39.004 --> 30:40.213
Hello.

30:41.298 --> 30:43.758
-Where is it?
-It's behind the wall.

30:43.842 --> 30:47.178
-All right. See any wires? Any smoke?
-No. I didn't look.

30:47.262 --> 30:50.556
-All right, so how do you know it's a bomb?
-The car has been parked illegally.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.891
The suspension is sagging.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.851
There's definitely something heavy
in the trunk.

30:53.936 --> 30:56.437
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peek inside

30:56.522 --> 30:58.648
and tell me what you see?

30:58.732 --> 31:00.942
You want me to go close to it?

31:01.360 --> 31:03.444
Yeah. No. I don't. No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.196
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

31:56.456 --> 31:59.041
ELDRIDGE: Shit. It's coming from over here!

32:05.757 --> 32:08.134
Blaster One, you there?

32:13.015 --> 32:15.224
Blaster One, you hear me?

32:16.143 --> 32:17.893
Here. Go!

32:24.693 --> 32:25.818
Shit.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.822
Let's go, guys.

32:30.824 --> 32:31.907
-Sarge.
-Yeah?

32:31.992 --> 32:34.493
-Let it go.
-ELDRIDGE: I got top cover.

32:34.578 --> 32:37.496
That's a negative, Specialist.
Eldridge, you stay with me.

32:37.581 --> 32:40.082
-Sanborn, you take top cover.
-Shit.

Blaster Mike in position.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.234
What do you got?

33:48.318 --> 33:51.696
I got a through and through to the chest,
but I got him stable.

33:51.780 --> 33:55.157
-He's not going to make it.
-If we leave here in 15 minutes,

33:55.242 --> 33:59.078
-he's got a survivable wound, sir.
-He's not going to make it.

(SHOT FIRING)

34:28.150 --> 34:29.400
Oh, God.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.580
-What's he doing?
-I don't know.

34:46.543 --> 34:47.543
What are you doing?

34:47.627 --> 34:50.296
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.590
If I'm going to die,

34:52.674 --> 34:56.260
I wanna die comfortable.
I need my kit and my cans, yeah.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.764
-What's going on down there, Eldridge?
-I'm getting his kit and his cans.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.515
Cover me, please.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.110

for the initiating system.

36:22.055 --> 36:24.390
Well, it's not in the back seat.

36:26.434 --> 36:27.977
I don't think.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.742
All right. It's not in the back seat.

36:52.377 --> 36:55.671
Got a young man on the roof,
your nine o'clock, keep an eye on him.

36:55.755 --> 36:57.131
Roger that.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.099
It's not in the front seat.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.440
It's not in the door.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.072
Not on the floors.

37:26.119 --> 37:27.661
Not in the glove box.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.247
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car.

37:30.332 --> 37:34.168
Yeah. No wire leads under the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.843
-Hey, Sanborn.
-Yeah.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.930
You got eyes on some guy
with a video camera?

37:46.014 --> 37:49.099
-No. Where?
-He's right at my 12 o'clock. You see him?

37:49.184 --> 37:52.186
He's pointing the fucking thing right at me.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.073
Shit. Negative. I don't see him.

38:04.366 --> 38:08.118
Hey, Sanborn. He's right at my 12 o'clock.
Look, 12 o'clock!

38:08.995 --> 38:10.871

to put me on YouTube.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.630
-Little shady.
-Yeah, he looks shady.

38:19.714 --> 38:22.883
-Keep an eye on him.
-Okay. So, what's the play?

38:24.052 --> 38:26.679
Be smart. Make a good decision, over.

38:26.888 --> 38:28.222

-SANBORN: Hey, James, how you doing?
-I'm wonderful. How are you?

38:50.912 --> 38:53.330
You know, we've been here a while.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.917
-We need to get out of here soon.
-Uh-huh.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.342
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.846
Roger that. I'm going to figure this out.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.808
SANBORN: James,
we need to get out of here.

39:13.810 --> 39:17.688
-James, do you copy?
-Fuck it. I get it.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.066
Fuck me.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.568

39:28.283 --> 39:29.450
(VOICES FROM GROUND)

39:29.534 --> 39:32.911
-Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?
-All clear.

39:33.455 --> 39:37.041
James, the evac is complete. We can leave.
Let the engineers handle this mess.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.460
-We moving?
-That's affirmative.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.967
(SQUEAKING)

39:53.641 --> 39:55.559
-Interesting.
-What's up with James?

39:55.643 --> 39:59.688
-He's not answering me.
-Yeah. I think he removed his headset.

40:01.316 --> 40:04.485
Will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

40:04.569 --> 40:09.990
Hey, James! Sergeant Sanborn is asking
if you'll please put your headset back on.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.749
Uh, that's a negative.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.417
That, yeah, that's not going to happen.

40:20.502 --> 40:21.585
Shit.

40:37.018 --> 40:40.104
I got eyes on three guys
at the minaret at six o'clock.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.834
-SANBORN: What the hell is he doing?
-I don't know what the fuck he's doing.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.378
Looks like he's checking the oil.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.959
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

41:44.043 --> 41:47.504
-This is real bad, man.
-Get behind the Jersey barrier.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.761
-I can't see James from here.
-Get down now!

42:00.268 --> 42:01.602
We can go!

43:08.836 --> 43:10.337
That was good.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.683
-Hey, James?
-Yeah, yeah.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.979
Never turn your headset off again.

-You the guy in the bomb suit?
-No, sir. Sir, that's Sergeant James.

-He's right here.
-Hey, James.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.929
-Yep.
-Someone's here to see you.

-He's a wild man. You know that?

-I want to shake your hand.

have you disarmed?

-Sergeant?

-Eight hundred and seventy-three, sir.
-Eight hundred and seventy-three.

Eight hundred and seventy-three!
That's just hot shit.

-Eight hundred and seventy-three.
-Counting today, sir, yes.

44:41.262 --> 44:43.263

disarming one of these things?

45:38.736 --> 45:41.154
-All right. What's your name?
-Beckham.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.907
-Beckham, like the soccer player?
-Yeah, man. It's like the soccer player.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.659
-Now give me my ball.
-Are you a soccer player?

45:45.743 --> 45:48.578
Yeah, man. I'm best of the best.
I'm better than Becks.

45:48.663 --> 45:50.747
-You play goalie?
-Yes. I play goalie.

45:50.832 --> 45:52.416
Good. I'll make you a deal.

45:52.500 --> 45:56.253
If you can stop the ball,
I'm going to give you 5 bucks.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.130
-But if you can't...
-$5, man? What about 10, 20?

45:58.214 --> 46:01.800
If I score... Listen to me.
If I score, I'm going to keep your ball.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.343
-Deal?
-Deal.

-Are you ready?

-Yeah.

46:22.363 --> 46:23.447
(LAUGHING)

46:23.531 --> 46:24.531
Shit.

46:24.615 --> 46:26.491
Come on. Where's the $5? Man, come on.

46:26.576 --> 46:29.202
All right. I got you. Good job, dude.

46:30.163 --> 46:32.414
-There's 10.
-You're an EOD?

46:32.665 --> 46:33.665
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

46:33.749 --> 46:37.335
-That's right.
-It's fun, no? It's cool? It's gangster.

46:38.212 --> 46:39.296
Yeah?

46:40.214 --> 46:43.341
Yeah, I think so. Tell you what.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.888
I'm going to buy... Let me see
if I have enough money, yeah, 5.

46:48.556 --> 46:51.141
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

46:51.434 --> 46:58.064
But if it's shaky, look at me,
or out of focus, or any way not 100%,

46:58.983 --> 47:01.693
I'm going to chop off your goddamn head
with a dull knife.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.613
How do you feel about...
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Here.

47:04.739 --> 47:05.822
(LAUGHING)

47:05.907 --> 47:08.408
You're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't you?

47:09.994 --> 47:13.330
CAMBRIDGE: Owen. Hi.

47:13.414 --> 47:14.873
-Hey, sir.
-How are you?

47:15.458 --> 47:17.083
-I'm good.
-Good.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.711
-What's wrong?
-Brakes are squeaking.

47:20.254 --> 47:23.423
Don't trust the mechanics around here,
you know?

47:23.508 --> 47:27.177
-So, how you doing?
-I'm good. I just want to check the oil.

47:28.304 --> 47:33.725
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well.
Feeling pretty squared away, actually, Doc.

47:34.268 --> 47:36.019
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.730
So, you getting along
with the other soldiers in your unit?

47:40.316 --> 47:45.237
Yeah. My team's great.
My team leader is inspiring.

47:45.863 --> 47:48.949
-You being sarcastic, soldier?
-No.

47:49.617 --> 47:52.911
He's going to get me killed,
almost died yesterday.

47:53.955 --> 47:57.749
At least I'll die in the line of duty,
proud and strong.

47:58.292 --> 48:00.961
You know, this doesn't have to be
a bad time in your life.

48:01.045 --> 48:04.130
Going to war is
a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

48:04.632 --> 48:06.007
It could be fun.

48:06.092 --> 48:08.760
And you know this
from your extensive work in the field, right?

48:08.844 --> 48:12.597
-I've done my field duty.
-Where was that? Yale?

48:14.475 --> 48:17.227
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

48:17.311 --> 48:19.229
These talks are voluntary.

48:19.313 --> 48:23.733
Look, I'm sorry.
I appreciate what you're saying. I do.

48:23.818 --> 48:25.235
I appreciate our sessions together,

48:25.319 --> 48:30.156
but you need to come out
from behind the wire and see what we do.

48:31.158 --> 48:35.954
Well, if the circumstance calls for it, I will.
Just like every other soldier.

48:41.127 --> 48:44.462
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

Hold on a second.

49:00.855 --> 49:02.105
God damn it.

49:02.189 --> 49:04.899
-I think I forgot my gloves down there.
-What?

49:04.984 --> 49:07.110
I forgot my gloves. Hang on.

misfire all the time.

49:45.900 --> 49:47.651
What are you doing?

49:48.027 --> 49:50.862
I'm just saying shit happens, they misfire.

49:53.532 --> 49:55.825
He'd be obliterated to nothing.

49:57.161 --> 49:59.579
SANBORN: His helmet would be left.
You could have that.

49:59.664 --> 50:02.624
Little specks of hair charred on the inside.

50:03.459 --> 50:07.253
ELDRIDGE: Yeah. There'd be
half a helmet somewhere, bits of hair.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.925
Have to ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

50:12.009 --> 50:15.136
and make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

50:18.182 --> 50:20.475
You'd have to write the report.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.938
-Are you serious?
-I can't write it.

50:26.232 --> 50:29.150
No. I mean,
are you serious about killing him?

51:08.482 --> 51:12.110
ELDRIDGE: Twelve o'clock, I see an SUV.
SANBORN: Roger that.

51:12.194 --> 51:15.488
ELDRIDGE: I got four armed men.
They're in haji gear.

51:17.366 --> 51:19.242
JAMES: All right. Go slow and easy, man.

51:26.959 --> 51:28.501
We're in it now.

51:32.047 --> 51:34.340
SANBORN: All right.
Careful now, guys. Careful.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.384

-I got you.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.399
Pistol off your hip, now.

52:33.901 --> 52:36.820
What you want me to do?
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?

52:38.989 --> 52:41.074
-Keep your hands up.
-Okay.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.539
Easy, easy.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.624
Got it!

52:51.627 --> 52:54.003
Can I touch my fucking head now?

52:55.089 --> 52:56.256
Slowly.

53:03.722 --> 53:06.307
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

Oh, Jesus.

TEAM LEADER: You guys are
wired fucking tight, you know that?

53:10.980 --> 53:12.939
JAMES: Right. Well, this is no place
for a picnic, right?

53:13.023 --> 53:15.942
-What are you guys doing here?
-We have a flat tire. Can you help us?

53:16.026 --> 53:17.569
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

53:17.653 --> 53:19.654
We have spares,
but we used up our wrench.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.281
How do you use up a wrench?

53:21.365 --> 53:24.993
Well, the guy over there with the red thing
on his head, he threw it at someone.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.202
(LAUGHING)

53:26.287 --> 53:27.620
-All right.
-Thank you.

-This is Chris. This is the wrench man.
-Hello, wrench man.

53:36.046 --> 53:38.339
-That's Jimmy.
-You know, you can shoot people here.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.592
-You don't have to throw a wrench.
-Fuck off.

53:50.436 --> 53:54.397
Take a look at this.
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

And the other, Al Rawi, jack of clubs.

-TEAM LEADER: Yeah. That's them.

54:12.124 --> 54:13.917
Does he need a little help there?

54:14.001 --> 54:15.668
What's the problem with the tire? Come on.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.757
No good, boss. This wrench is too small.

54:20.841 --> 54:22.091
All right, solutions? Anyone?

54:22.176 --> 54:24.802
I think there's another wrench in the back
of the Humvee, if you wanna check.

54:24.887 --> 54:27.180
-I'll give it a try.
-All right. Let's do it.

We have 22 days after today, sir.

-I got him.
-Fire when ready.

1:02:36.253 --> 1:02:39.880
He's moving. He's moving. He's moving.
To the building. Follow him. You got him?

1:02:40.382 --> 1:02:41.674
Got him.

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:47.054

-Hey, Will.
-Yeah?

1:07:36.636 --> 1:07:40.472
At your six o'clock,
I see movement on the bridge.

1:07:40.932 --> 1:07:45.185
-Right on the tracks.
-Well, handle it.

1:07:49.983 --> 1:07:53.861
-Should I fire?
-It's your call, buddy.

1:08:23.475 --> 1:08:24.767
Good job.

Well, yes, sir, Sergeant James, sir.

You're not very good with people,
are you, sir?

1:09:36.923 --> 1:09:38.674
But you're a good warrior.
Give me your mug.

Well, you know, I had a girlfriend,
and she got pregnant, so we got married.

1:10:44.490 --> 1:10:46.074
We got divorced.

1:10:48.494 --> 1:10:52.456
Or, you know, I thought we got divorced.
I mean, she's still living in the house,

1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:55.959
and she says we're still together,
so I don't know.

1:10:56.044 --> 1:10:57.669
What does that make her? I don't know.

-Make babies.

I ain't ready for that yet. I know that.

that could have killed any one of us.

-I think it's interesting, too.

than I hit you, motherfucker,

1:12:52.452 --> 1:12:54.578

(BABY SQUEALING)

2:01:31.409 --> 2:01:34.745
-Wow. You did some shopping.
-Yeah.

2:01:35.580 --> 2:01:37.581
I got some soda. We done?

2:01:39.125 --> 2:01:42.461
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

2:01:42.545 --> 2:01:44.546
Okay. Cereal.

2:01:48.885 --> 2:01:50.052
Where...

2:02:49.362 --> 2:02:52.990
Some guy drove his truck
to the middle of an Iraqi market,

2:02:53.616 --> 2:02:55.701
starts passing out free candies.

2:02:55.785 --> 2:02:59.121
All the kids come running up,
the families and stuff.

2:03:00.457 --> 2:03:01.957
He detonates.

2:03:04.294 --> 2:03:06.420
They're saying 59 are dead.

2:03:16.306 --> 2:03:18.807
You know they need more bomb techs.

2:03:21.978 --> 2:03:24.396
You want to chop those up for me?

2:03:25.315 --> 2:03:26.607
Boing! Boing!

2:03:26.691 --> 2:03:28.233
(BABY LAUGHING)

2:03:28.318 --> 2:03:30.027
(MUSIC BOX CHIMING)

2:03:30.987 --> 2:03:32.321
(LAUGHING)

2:03:33.656 --> 2:03:34.656
(BABY MURMURING)

2:03:34.741 --> 2:03:35.824
Yeah.

2:03:38.036 --> 2:03:40.454
You love playing with that.

2:03:40.538 --> 2:03:43.916
You love playing
with all your stuffed animals.

2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:49.338
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.

2:03:49.881 --> 2:03:51.757
You love everything, don't you?

2:03:51.841 --> 2:03:52.841
Yeah.

2:03:52.926 --> 2:03:54.009
(BABY MURMURING)

2:03:54.094 --> 2:03:57.846
But you know what, buddy?
As you get older,

2:03:58.848 --> 2:04:03.936
some of the things that you love might
not seem so special anymore, you know.

2:04:05.105 --> 2:04:07.147
Like your jack-in-the-box.

2:04:09.901 --> 2:04:14.363
Maybe you realize
it's just a piece of tin and a stuffed animal.

2:04:16.449 --> 2:04:20.953
As you get older,
there are fewer things you really love.

2:04:24.290 --> 2:04:28.460
And by the time you get to my age,
maybe it's only one or two things.

2:04:36.553 --> 2:04:38.595
With me, I think it's one.

2:05:15.216 --> 2:05:17.759
-Welcome to Delta Company.
-Sergeant.
