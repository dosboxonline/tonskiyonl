02:51.171 --> 02:53.297
Yeah, you can leave her in the hallway for now.

02:57.385 --> 03:01.263
Stabilizing here.
- Where's the portable x-ray?

03:38.301 --> 03:40.010
Check, charge or cash?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.887
Cash. And, uh...

03:43.473 --> 03:47.017
...make it out to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

03:47.435 --> 03:49.645
Seven eighty-eight thirty.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.155
Okay.

05:38.254 --> 05:39.421
Hey.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.298
Taking me to breakfast?

05:41.466 --> 05:43.050
I can't, I'm meeting Bosko.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.261
Hey, Vincent.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.513
- Mom, where are my barrettes?
- Hi, sweetie.

05:48.681 --> 05:52.100
- I saw them on the kitchen table.
- They're not there. I already checked.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.478
- Want me to make coffee?
- No school today?

05:54.645 --> 05:57.898
My dad's taking me to the new
building and then to lunch.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.275
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.072
He's already a half an hour late.

06:05.865 --> 06:09.451
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.245
- I'll make coffee.
- I'm out of time, babe.

06:25.009 --> 06:27.928
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not in the couch.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.555
Wear the blue ones.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.350
I don't wanna wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

06:33.518 --> 06:36.186
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.064
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- Find them.

06:39.232 --> 06:42.150
- Mom, pay attention.
- All right, sweetie, all right. What?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.277
- Daddy's gonna be here.
- Okay, he's gonna...

06:44.445 --> 06:46.363
I'm not gonna be ready.
I can't be late.

06:46.531 --> 06:48.698
- You won't be late.
- No, I will be late.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.827
Okay. Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.037
- It's all right, baby. It's all right.
- No.

06:54.205 --> 06:55.831
It's all right. It's all right.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.917
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together.

06:59.085 --> 07:03.839
Just relax. He won't come before
we find them. I promise you.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.851
Hey. Give me another refill.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.105
Now he wants a refill.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.116
- What's your name?
- Waingro.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.168
You're Michael, huh?

07:53.514 --> 07:56.224
You guys always work together?

07:56.392 --> 07:58.059
All the time.

07:58.227 --> 08:00.770
- Real tight crew, huh?
- Real tight.

08:01.856 --> 08:05.734
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.403
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

08:18.831 --> 08:22.292
- How's he doing?
- A hundred percent.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.377
Right on schedule.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.254
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.843
- We're a mile and a half from you.
- Okay.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.953
Just crossed over the number-one lane,
300 yards from you now.

08:58.120 --> 09:00.539
- Get set.
- I am.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.831
Put that on.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.799
Here we go.

10:11.193 --> 10:14.362
Two eleven! Two eleven! We're being held up!

10:20.161 --> 10:22.454
Two-eleven alarm. Armored car.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.539
There's the call. Three minutes.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.792
Clear!

11:31.315 --> 11:33.233
Eighty seconds left!

11:34.485 --> 11:37.278
Get back. Get back.

11:37.446 --> 11:38.863
Get back!

11:40.616 --> 11:43.243
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.954
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

11:58.300 --> 11:59.801
I got it.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.594
Got it.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.349
You had to fuck with me.

12:06.517 --> 12:08.268
You wanna fuck with me?

12:32.334 --> 12:34.169
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

12:34.336 --> 12:35.920
- What did you do?
- I had to, man.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.256
- Guy was making a move.
- Let's go.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.724
Dumb motherfucker.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.756
- Step back, please, sir.
- I heard them.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.365
A million six.

13:45.866 --> 13:48.409
Forty cents on the dollar, 640,000 to you.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.954
Here's a 150 front money.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.414
Get you the rest in two, three days.

13:54.750 --> 13:56.751
Know who owned these?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.257
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

14:03.008 --> 14:06.427
Roger Van Zant. Owns banks in the Caymans.

14:06.595 --> 14:10.098
Runs investment portfolios for
offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

14:10.641 --> 14:13.601
- So?
- So you ripped off his bearer bonds.

14:13.769 --> 14:15.937
He's got insurance.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.940
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

14:19.108 --> 14:22.944
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60 percent of their value.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.114
And make 40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.911
Sell it back to him instead of going to the
street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.788
Try it on him.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.332
- Kelso called.
- About what?

14:36.500 --> 14:39.085
A score he's putting out
and wants you to look at.

14:39.795 --> 14:41.838
What do I need his score for? I got my own.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.132
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.302
- Nine a.m. Tomorrow.
- What happened out there?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.680
Don't ask.

15:25.507 --> 15:26.549
Find the ambulance?

15:26.717 --> 15:30.261
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

15:30.721 --> 15:33.806
They torched it. Burned everything.
The guns, clothes, everything.

15:33.974 --> 15:36.184
Investigators are still
working the scene...

15:36.352 --> 15:38.603
They were airborne.
Taped the last few seconds...

15:38.771 --> 15:41.022
...of the black-and-whites
doing demolition derby.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.068
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.

15:45.235 --> 15:47.862
Yellow pickup truck out of
Whittier day before yesterday.

15:48.572 --> 15:52.992
You taking this one, lieutenant,
or does it stay in Division?

15:53.619 --> 15:57.038
This look like gangbangers working
the local 7-Eleven to you?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.624
- Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah.
- All yours.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.294
We got three motorists. All they saw
were men with masks. They were distant.

16:03.462 --> 16:07.382
Console TV man over there however,
he was closer.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.509
He ID anybody?

16:09.677 --> 16:12.720
Well, he was hiding.
He heard it mostly.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.557
Okay. What about them?

16:16.725 --> 16:20.395
Right. Now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

16:20.562 --> 16:22.939
- Smart.
- Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."

16:23.107 --> 16:24.565
- Slick?
- Yeah.

16:24.733 --> 16:30.238
Now, this guy... I figure this guy went for
that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?

16:30.406 --> 16:31.823
From here.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.659
Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.411
To his side.

16:36.578 --> 16:41.457
This guy here has got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.419
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.045
Probably executed.

16:47.881 --> 16:52.260
And it was a million six in bearer bonds,
and they ignored the loose cash.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.138
Because they had no time,
because they were on a clock.

16:55.305 --> 16:58.099
Which means they knew our
response time to a 211...

16:58.267 --> 17:01.477
...had our air,
immobilized it, entered...

17:01.937 --> 17:04.063
...escaped in under three minutes.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.858
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

17:07.026 --> 17:11.612
- Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.
- Traffic video camera?

17:11.780 --> 17:13.781
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

17:13.949 --> 17:15.450
You recognize the M.O.?

17:15.617 --> 17:18.368
M.O. Is that they're good.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.372
Once it escalated into a
murder-one beef for all of them...

17:21.540 --> 17:24.625
...after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate...

17:24.792 --> 17:28.671
...popped guard number three because
what difference does it make?

17:28.839 --> 17:30.590
Why leave a living witness?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.052
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock 'r roll.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.473
The shape charge.

17:38.640 --> 17:42.393
The shape charge indicates that
they are technically proficient.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.479
Proficient enough to
go in on the prowl.

17:44.646 --> 17:48.274
So let's start looking for recent high-line
burglaries that have mystified us.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.610
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.945
You're gonna get the phone book. Do it anyway.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.115
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

17:56.325 --> 17:59.827
Check the usual fences.
You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

17:59.995 --> 18:03.706
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.
Hang in with Forensics.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.667
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

18:06.835 --> 18:09.754
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.591
Get your hand out of that mars pocket, Rachel.

18:13.759 --> 18:14.842
Oh, Vince.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.143
Want some pie?

18:33.362 --> 18:35.446
Gotta go to the john.

19:05.811 --> 19:09.897
Look, I had to get it on, man.
He was making a move. I had to get it on.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.081
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

19:27.624 --> 19:30.084
...to make up for his full end.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.754
Because I wanna pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.922
Okay.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.213
Hold it!

21:50.392 --> 21:51.934
Hey.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.023
- Where's the rest?
- We're late.

21:57.190 --> 22:01.235
Ooh, you look too good to go out.
I could just jump you right here.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.907
- Where is it?
- Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.494
There's more in a couple days,
so don't sweat it. We really are late.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.789
Yeah, come on,
you gotta be kidding me.

22:15.292 --> 22:18.294
Honey, it ain't won'th the
risks you take for 8000.

22:18.462 --> 22:21.297
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.799
Let's go. Get your coat.

22:25.927 --> 22:29.221
There is no point talking to you.
All you are is a child growing older.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.723
What's that supposed to mean?

22:30.891 --> 22:35.061
It means we're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

22:35.228 --> 22:37.480
I'm married to a gambling
junkie who won't listen.

22:37.647 --> 22:39.315
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.402
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

22:43.570 --> 22:46.906
You're not! What do you want from me?
Leave the bankbook and car keys...

22:47.074 --> 22:50.284
...in the kitchen on your way out.
Are we going, or am I going alone?

22:50.452 --> 22:52.953
You could keep that other crap
but Dominick would go with me.

22:55.123 --> 22:56.665
Don't you even think about...

23:21.316 --> 23:23.776
Yeah. Tell me Albert
Torena called back.

23:25.153 --> 23:28.155
- Albert Torena call Vincent?
- No.

23:28.323 --> 23:30.658
No. Report came in.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.994
The explosive was Dynex,
linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

23:34.162 --> 23:38.165
You can pick it up with a driver's
license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.670
- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent.
- Oh, that's wonderful.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.816
Are you all right?

24:03.984 --> 24:06.527
What happened? Where you been?

24:06.695 --> 24:07.862
Work.

24:09.030 --> 24:11.323
Laurers dad show up?

24:12.534 --> 24:17.079
Didrt call, didn't show.
We waited for you till 10:30.

24:17.873 --> 24:22.418
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

24:24.337 --> 24:26.005
I don't know.

24:26.381 --> 24:28.048
Fucking jerk.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.051
Well, is she okay?

24:32.053 --> 24:34.054
She's been in her room all day.

24:34.222 --> 24:37.391
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

24:37.559 --> 24:42.813
Uh, I made dinner for us, four hours ago. Um...

24:42.981 --> 24:48.027
Every time I try to maintain a
consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

24:48.612 --> 24:54.742
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.577
I'm sorry...

24:56.745 --> 25:00.915
...if the goddamn chicken...

25:01.249 --> 25:03.709
...got overcooked.

25:20.852 --> 25:23.771
Seven men in Denmark, to a key defendant here.

25:26.816 --> 25:29.443
- Did you find it?
- Not yet.

25:30.278 --> 25:31.820
There it is.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.866
It's over here, somewhere.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.791
- Interior design?
- It's on the back wall.

25:59.641 --> 26:02.434
- Coffee, sir?
- Please.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.567
Will you pass the cream?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.988
- Thanks.
- What did you get?

26:15.657 --> 26:17.074
What?

26:17.617 --> 26:19.493
What are you reading?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.166
Book about metals.

26:30.130 --> 26:33.215
"Stress Fractures in Titanium."

26:34.175 --> 26:36.135
What kind of work you do?

26:39.139 --> 26:42.516
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

26:46.605 --> 26:48.689
I've seen you in the store from time to time.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.274
What store?

26:50.525 --> 26:52.318
Hennessey + Ingalls. I work there.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.153
Uh...

26:54.321 --> 26:59.033
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.921
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

27:13.089 --> 27:17.551
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.
My name's Neil.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.183
I'm Eady.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.354
You like working there?

27:29.689 --> 27:31.273
Sure.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.652
I get a discount and there's a
whole section of books in my area.

27:34.819 --> 27:36.862
What area's that?

27:37.030 --> 27:38.989
Graphic design.

27:39.407 --> 27:42.951
I do, um, letterheads and logotypes at night...

27:43.119 --> 27:45.954
...and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.165
Who do you do that for?

27:49.876 --> 27:52.586
Uh, a restaurant.

27:52.754 --> 27:55.631
I did their menus, and, um...

27:57.550 --> 28:00.052
...a small, uh, record label.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.807
CDs. I've done two so far.

28:06.434 --> 28:08.560
You go to school for that?

28:08.728 --> 28:10.145
Heh, yeah.

28:10.814 --> 28:13.607
- Yeah, I went to Parsons.
- Where's that?

28:13.775 --> 28:14.817
New York City.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.319
How long you been out here?

28:18.613 --> 28:20.447
About a year.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.950
- You like it?
- Ha, ha.

28:23.785 --> 28:27.162
Not really. I'm mostly
here for the work.

28:34.462 --> 28:36.547
- Live in this neighborhood?
- Ah, no...

28:36.715 --> 28:39.633
...I live, um,
kind of above Sunset Plaza.

28:40.135 --> 28:43.303
It's actually kind of...
It's a little house that I rent.

28:43.471 --> 28:47.975
And it's just kind of run-down,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

28:48.643 --> 28:49.727
What about you?

28:49.894 --> 28:53.480
- I live up here.
- That's very funny.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.862
So where's your family
from originally?

29:00.029 --> 29:01.321
Um...

29:01.865 --> 29:04.074
I'm Scotch-lrish.

29:04.534 --> 29:10.706
They, um, emigrated to
Appalachia in the late 1700s.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.333
Where are you from?

29:13.835 --> 29:15.669
The Bay Area.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.464
Are your folks there?

29:20.675 --> 29:25.179
Uh, my mother died a long time ago,
and my father, I don't know where he is.

29:25.346 --> 29:26.889
Got a brother somewhere.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.189
You have a tight family. I can tell.

29:35.356 --> 29:37.191
- Yep.
- Right?

29:37.358 --> 29:39.193
You're right.

29:46.242 --> 29:47.910
Yeah...

29:48.453 --> 29:50.662
City of lights.

29:53.583 --> 29:59.630
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae.
They come out once a year in the water.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.591
That's what it looks like out there.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.594
You been there?

30:06.221 --> 30:08.055
No, I'm going there someday.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.516
Oh, yeah?

30:17.232 --> 30:18.357
You travel a lot?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.488
- Yeah.
- Traveling makes you lonely?

30:29.911 --> 30:33.789
L... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.666
You?

30:36.501 --> 30:38.585
I get lonely.

32:42.877 --> 32:44.753
Albert!

32:46.881 --> 32:48.715
- Shit.
- Albert.

32:48.883 --> 32:50.842
Vincent, what you doing
coming here, man?

32:51.010 --> 32:52.386
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

32:52.553 --> 32:57.182
You were supposed to get back to me last night,
Albert. Where the fuck you been?

32:57.725 --> 33:01.436
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know.
- Let's violate his ass right now.

33:01.604 --> 33:05.732
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?

33:06.442 --> 33:08.735
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.

33:08.903 --> 33:11.238
I'm hitting like one of
them flamingo-matador guys.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.532
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.

33:13.700 --> 33:17.119
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

33:17.286 --> 33:19.663
- I'm a dancer, man. You know.
- Bullshit.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.249
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.002
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

33:25.169 --> 33:28.088
Where is your empathy,
brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.548
Empathy was yesterday.

33:29.716 --> 33:31.675
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.011
- Vincent, man, look...
- Did you fall in love?

33:34.178 --> 33:37.597
Come on. Did you fall in love last
night and you went off somewhere?

33:37.765 --> 33:40.100
- Vincent...
- Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

33:40.268 --> 33:42.936
- I'll buy that.
- Vincent.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.229
Give me all you got!

33:44.397 --> 33:46.398
- Vincent...
- Give me all you got!

33:46.566 --> 33:50.402
I swear, man, my brother, man...
My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.279
I heard "Richard"?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.573
- He's gonna talk to you.
- Richard?

33:54.741 --> 33:56.074
- Richard.
- Richard.

33:56.242 --> 33:59.286
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight.
- He's not here, is he?

33:59.787 --> 34:02.789
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight.
- Tonight? What happened to now?

34:03.249 --> 34:06.752
L... l... I implored him because
I knew you was coming this a.m.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.045
- This is a bunch of bullshit.
- No, no, I swear.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.466
- He said no because he in Phoenix.
- Ahh.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.552
But this, man,
I swear... I swear, man...

34:22.726 --> 34:24.936
Tonight's the best I
can do for you, man.

34:25.605 --> 34:31.234
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

34:31.527 --> 34:33.737
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.322
You be there too.

34:35.489 --> 34:38.366
Vincent, I can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vincent.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.995
- I got things to do, places to be. I got...
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:42.663 --> 34:44.331
Be there.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.047
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

34:56.344 --> 34:58.053
What is it?

34:59.305 --> 35:00.847
It's a bank.

35:01.015 --> 35:04.309
It depos cash on Thursday for
distribution to all the other branches...

35:04.477 --> 35:06.520
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

35:06.687 --> 35:09.856
So on Thursdays, the command
branch has got a full whack.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.692
- On the prowl or strong?
- Strong. Through the front door.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.694
- How many guys?
- Eh...

35:14.862 --> 35:17.864
Four, or three plus a driver.
Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

35:18.032 --> 35:19.407
And you want a 100,000 advance...

35:19.575 --> 35:21.868
- ...against a 10-percent cut for that?
- Uh-huh.

35:22.036 --> 35:25.330
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.
They hit the holdup alarms...

35:25.498 --> 35:28.208
...I gotta get out before
the cops show. What is that?

35:28.417 --> 35:30.752
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

35:30.920 --> 35:33.046
Two telco and a cellular.

35:34.882 --> 35:37.843
See, but the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

35:38.010 --> 35:43.849
See, the night before, you cut in and
trick out the alarm-system computer...

35:44.016 --> 35:49.604
...to turn itself and the video recorders
off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.315
Architectural, electrical-engineering plans?

35:52.483 --> 35:56.736
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards
already built. They go straight into the CPU.

35:58.072 --> 35:59.739
What's the estimate?

36:02.869 --> 36:05.704
Twelve-point-one-, 12.2 million.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.708
You're on.

36:10.626 --> 36:11.918
Congratulations.

36:12.086 --> 36:16.047
And to give you a little idea of where my
estimates come from, this is a printout...

36:16.215 --> 36:18.633
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

36:18.801 --> 36:22.304
Be that as it may, my way you get 100
percent from the insurance company...

36:22.471 --> 36:25.140
...and take the bonds from us
at 60 cents on the dollar...

36:25.308 --> 36:27.392
...and make yourself
another 40 percent.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.938
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.608
Sure, you got a deal.

36:34.775 --> 36:38.486
Good, because there's no percentage if
everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

36:38.654 --> 36:42.282
Yeah, so you have your man
call me and we'll set the meet.

36:42.450 --> 36:43.825
Yeah, okay.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.660
Nice talking to you.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.288
You gonna deal with these guys?

36:48.456 --> 36:51.458
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

36:51.626 --> 36:54.294
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.756
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.222
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.683
I have a printout of the, uh,
cash flow of the bank for the past two months.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.478
- How'd you get this information?
- Just comes to you.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.480
This stuffjust flies through the air.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.650
They send information out and it's
beamed out all over the place.

37:16.817 --> 37:20.153
All you have to do is know how to grab it.
See, I know how to grab it.

37:25.743 --> 37:30.121
Um... Okay, here we go.
Thirteen-point-nine million.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.751
- I bought it.
- Good.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.711
What did I tell you?

37:40.091 --> 37:41.591
Here.

37:42.468 --> 37:46.012
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

37:46.514 --> 37:50.100
- How is he?
- He's a businessman.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.061
Okay.

38:19.755 --> 38:22.424
- Avocado.
- "Avocado."

38:24.719 --> 38:26.594
- Hello?
- Yeah, hello.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.055
Chris is at my place.

38:32.310 --> 38:35.854
- What's wrong?
- Husband-and-wife stuff.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.898
I'll let him sleep it off here.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.456
What happened to you?

38:58.210 --> 39:02.255
- When you gonna get some furniture?
- When I get around to it.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.968
Charlene's gonna leave me.

39:08.971 --> 39:10.513
Why?

39:13.225 --> 39:15.268
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

39:16.228 --> 39:18.521
With everything we've been doing?

39:19.357 --> 39:22.525
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

39:22.902 --> 39:27.113
- When you gonna get an old lady?
- When I get around to it.

39:29.241 --> 39:31.159
You got something else on the side?

39:32.953 --> 39:34.120
Nothing regular.

39:35.081 --> 39:37.123
She got something else on the side?

39:37.291 --> 39:38.625
- No.
- You sure?

39:39.877 --> 39:41.795
Yeah, I'm sure.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.673
I don't know what you're doing.

39:46.842 --> 39:49.052
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say:

39:49.220 --> 39:51.137
"You wanna be making moves on the street?

39:51.305 --> 39:54.307
Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

39:54.475 --> 39:56.893
...that you cannot walk out
on in 30 seconds flat...

39:57.061 --> 39:59.521
...if you spot the heat
around the corner."

39:59.688 --> 40:01.231
Remember that?

40:07.863 --> 40:10.990
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.410
Yeah?

40:14.495 --> 40:16.121
Yeah.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.958
Okay.

40:24.964 --> 40:27.173
Today we take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

40:27.341 --> 40:30.385
...then I drop our deposit
on Kelso for this bank.

40:30.553 --> 40:31.845
Bank? What bank?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.014
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

40:35.182 --> 40:37.183
That goes too, then the bank.

40:41.230 --> 40:43.940
- You want some breakfast?
- Yeah.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.865
Are you okay?

40:52.032 --> 40:54.117
Yeah, sugar.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.540
Yeah.

41:00.875 --> 41:01.958
- For real.
- Okay.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.378
Gonna do good. I'll see you later.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.688
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.

41:23.856 --> 41:27.984
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to come
by here and see if you had a job for me.

41:28.152 --> 41:32.071
- You're familiar with this kind of operation?
- Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.

41:32.239 --> 41:35.575
Good. Good for you. Here, you'll mop
the toilets, hit the dishwasher...

41:35.743 --> 41:37.744
...bus tables and
empty the garbage too.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.830
Give me a hard time, I'll report
you loaded, drunk or stealing.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.583
And I will violate you back
so fast your head will spin.

41:43.751 --> 41:46.252
Twenty-five percent of your
take-home kicks back to me.

41:46.420 --> 41:49.923
Rules of the game. Call Grierson, check it out.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.008
Change in the back.

41:57.181 --> 41:59.432
Well, what are you waiting for?

42:18.244 --> 42:20.203
Malibu Equity and Investments.

42:20.371 --> 42:23.373
- Yeah, Roger Van Zant.
- Please hold.

42:26.961 --> 42:29.337
Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.

42:29.505 --> 42:30.964
I'm supposed to collect something.

42:31.632 --> 42:35.468
Give me your number, and somebody will
call you right back from a different line.

42:35.844 --> 42:39.639
818-133-6089.

43:03.205 --> 43:04.247
Yep.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.165
I got a package for you.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.376
There's a drive-in on Centinela.
Two-thirty tomorrow.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.087
Okay, just send one man, alone.

43:36.155 --> 43:37.947
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

43:38.115 --> 43:40.700
Who the...? Who...? Who was that guy?

43:40.868 --> 43:43.369
- He's nobody.
- I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

43:43.537 --> 43:45.038
- He's nobody, Neil.
- Listen, you...

43:45.205 --> 43:47.707
He's a legit liquor wholesaler from Las Vegas.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.543
- Alan Marciano.
- Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.

43:50.711 --> 43:53.504
- It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

43:54.840 --> 43:58.009
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

43:58.177 --> 44:02.388
After that, he fucks up, then I will
finance setting you up myself...

44:02.556 --> 44:04.641
...on my own, anywhere you want.

44:04.808 --> 44:07.810
Dominick will go with you. And my word counts.

44:07.978 --> 44:12.148
But right now, you will give him the chance.

44:15.903 --> 44:20.823
Clean up. Go home.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.453
Give me all your money.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.914
One day you gonna get smoked with that shit.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.249
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

45:14.628 --> 45:18.339
- He's coming in alone. Send him through.
- Yeah, got it.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.370
Vincent, hey, man.

45:50.873 --> 45:54.333
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard.
Richard, Vincent.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.919
- Richard.
- Yo, it's all right.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.297
What have you got for me?

45:59.465 --> 46:01.340
Before we even get into that...

46:01.508 --> 46:05.678
...there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas, all right?

46:05.846 --> 46:08.222
Now, the back of a
trim shop on Irvine...

46:08.390 --> 46:11.476
...if somebody was to pay a
little visit this weekend...

46:11.643 --> 46:15.521
...they might find two Turbos and a 911 Slope.

46:15.689 --> 46:18.357
You're looking to rid
yourself of your competition.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.277
- Hmm?
- Eh, I'm a good citizen.

46:21.445 --> 46:25.198
I'm Donald Duck. So you got
something to tell me or what?

46:26.825 --> 46:29.243
Check this out, coz.

46:29.411 --> 46:33.039
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

46:33.207 --> 46:35.708
...you're gonna do what the
fuck I need to get done?

46:35.876 --> 46:39.629
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man.
We do business all the time.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.089
I ain't your coz,
you rat motherfucker.

46:42.257 --> 46:47.887
And you know because I say so after I
hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.

46:48.055 --> 46:50.473
Look here, man. You understand what I'm saying?

46:50.641 --> 46:52.642
I can get killed for
telling you this shit.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.936
Or you're gonna get killed walking your doggie.

46:55.103 --> 46:56.938
All right.

46:57.105 --> 46:59.398
There's this cat I was locked up with in Folsom.

46:59.566 --> 47:03.820
Did a couple, two, three years.
He got out and I ran into him.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.282
And so?

47:08.450 --> 47:10.868
He's a big fiend for action.

47:11.036 --> 47:14.539
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing...

47:14.706 --> 47:18.417
...but he goes on and on, running down
to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

47:18.585 --> 47:21.254
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

47:21.421 --> 47:27.426
So right then and there I know this
cat's got something going down.

47:34.017 --> 47:35.893
Pretty fucking great.

47:37.563 --> 47:39.939
Albert, what's wrong with you?

47:40.482 --> 47:43.818
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

47:43.986 --> 47:47.154
You saw a guy on the street who's an ex-con?

47:47.322 --> 47:52.076
- That's right.
- Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

47:52.244 --> 47:54.620
What do you want for that, a Junior G-man badge?

47:54.788 --> 47:57.123
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

47:58.417 --> 47:59.458
Is he kidding me?

48:01.378 --> 48:04.088
- Vincent...
- I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

48:04.256 --> 48:05.756
You know what I'm saying?

48:05.924 --> 48:07.675
- Say what? Say what?
- What?

48:07.843 --> 48:12.763
- You said, "Slick." What does that mean?
- Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick."

48:13.891 --> 48:16.225
And tell me about him.

48:17.811 --> 48:21.856
About 6 feet tall,
lot ofjailhouse tats.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.317
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

48:26.653 --> 48:28.613
What's his name?

48:29.197 --> 48:30.990
Cheritto.

48:31.158 --> 48:34.160
Michael Cheritto.

48:37.164 --> 48:39.665
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.335
Eleven for armed robbery, three convictions.

48:42.502 --> 48:46.297
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef
in Attica. Three years in Marion.

48:46.465 --> 48:49.926
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

48:50.093 --> 48:51.928
- Jacket's 2 inches thick.
- Okay.

48:52.095 --> 48:55.014
- Who do I have there now?
- Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.

48:55.182 --> 48:57.016
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

48:57.184 --> 49:00.019
That's 24 hours. Round the clock, day and night.

49:00.187 --> 49:04.273
We never close. Open seven days a week.
Bug the car, the house, the work.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.525
When he moves or sits, like in a restaurant...

49:06.693 --> 49:08.986
...I want pictures of who
he moves and sits with.

49:09.154 --> 49:13.032
Then run makes on them. They got jackets,
I wanna see who they move and sit with.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.701
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.

50:11.216 --> 50:13.259
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- What?

50:13.427 --> 50:16.429
- Put your hands where I can see them.
- All right.

50:16.638 --> 50:20.224
I tell you what to do, I tell you how to do it.

50:20.600 --> 50:24.937
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

50:25.939 --> 50:28.607
...take the package
and throw it in here.

50:46.460 --> 50:48.127
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.792
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.920
- Yeah, who's this?
- You know who this is.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.464
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

52:15.632 --> 52:20.219
I sent a guy to deliver the package.
He didn't call. Is everything right?

52:20.762 --> 52:23.514
Tell you what, forget the money.

52:23.849 --> 52:27.560
- What?
- Forget the money.

52:28.395 --> 52:29.436
Wh...

52:29.604 --> 52:33.691
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

52:33.859 --> 52:36.735
What am I doing? I'm talking
to an empty telephone...

52:37.529 --> 52:38.571
I don't understand.

52:39.281 --> 52:42.408
Because there is a dead man on
the other end of this fucking line.

53:02.262 --> 53:03.929
Oh, my.

53:04.097 --> 53:06.432
- Do you like it?
- Look at my ring.

53:06.600 --> 53:09.018
- Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha.

53:12.105 --> 53:14.940
Did you know about this? It's so beautiful.

53:15.108 --> 53:16.775
You are insane.

53:21.865 --> 53:22.907
Do you like it?

53:23.074 --> 53:24.950
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

53:25.118 --> 53:28.454
- Just don't ask him where he got it.
- Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha-ha.

53:35.837 --> 53:38.172
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

53:38.340 --> 53:40.549
I don't know.

53:42.969 --> 53:45.721
She doesn't know. Just like me.
I don't know either.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.654
Hello?

54:02.155 --> 54:03.739
Hi, it's me.

54:03.907 --> 54:07.660
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

54:08.870 --> 54:11.747
I've been busy. Can I see you?

54:12.290 --> 54:16.919
I was afraid that was just
the one night, you know?

54:17.629 --> 54:20.005
No, not for me, it wasrt.

54:22.050 --> 54:24.093
Yeah, me neither.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.513
Can I fall by?

54:28.556 --> 54:31.850
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

54:42.237 --> 54:44.029
Thank you.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.532
- Good night.
- Ha-ha-ha.

54:47.033 --> 54:49.076
Goddamn convention.

54:49.995 --> 54:52.329
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

54:52.497 --> 54:53.706
Got two transmitters.

54:53.873 --> 54:56.917
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

54:57.335 --> 54:58.544
Okay, get ready.

54:58.712 --> 55:00.921
- Did you say good night to Neil?
- Good night.

55:01.089 --> 55:04.717
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis.
SIS has got a revolving tail...

55:04.884 --> 55:06.677
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

55:08.638 --> 55:12.224
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

55:12.392 --> 55:15.269
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

55:15.812 --> 55:18.397
Sammy and I think that's
gonna be their next score.

55:18.565 --> 55:20.566
Who's the loner?

55:22.944 --> 55:26.572
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

55:28.074 --> 55:30.242
Well, get on it.

55:38.918 --> 55:40.502
Okay.

55:47.635 --> 55:53.724
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

55:54.100 --> 55:57.770
...they're gonna have the
surprise of a lifetime.

56:13.036 --> 56:15.537
Hey, baby. Time to go.

56:16.164 --> 56:18.707
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

56:18.875 --> 56:20.918
Oh, yeah.

56:22.170 --> 56:25.381
You fly. You cool.

56:32.389 --> 56:36.725
You're lying to me. I can always
tell when people lie to me.

56:36.893 --> 56:40.896
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

56:41.064 --> 56:43.649
A regular rodeo rider.

56:43.817 --> 56:47.194
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

56:51.282 --> 56:53.909
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.

56:54.077 --> 56:56.370
You don't have a truth-telling style.

56:56.538 --> 57:01.083
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know what this is.

57:07.006 --> 57:10.050
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

57:28.486 --> 57:30.154
Where you been?

57:31.364 --> 57:33.365
SHU at Pelican Bay.

57:33.533 --> 57:35.909
New Folsom, B-wing.

57:36.202 --> 57:40.289
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.

57:40.457 --> 57:43.167
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

57:43.334 --> 57:45.711
That is why I am here.

57:52.218 --> 57:53.969
Why don't you...?

57:54.345 --> 57:57.681
Why don't you call this guy?

57:57.849 --> 58:00.517
This guy's always putting guys on.

58:04.355 --> 58:05.397
Thank you, brother.

58:06.858 --> 58:09.151
- I'll buy you a drink?
- Buy me a drink.

58:14.782 --> 58:16.408
- What's so funny?
- Nothing.

58:16.576 --> 58:19.786
- It's really dumb.
- Something smells negligent.

58:19.954 --> 58:22.873
You two are perfect for each other.
How did you meet?

58:27.462 --> 58:29.713
- I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.
- Uh-oh.

58:29.881 --> 58:32.049
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

58:32.217 --> 58:35.886
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers
and fold them over, one over the other.

58:36.054 --> 58:38.013
Then he'd turn his
eyelids inside out...

58:38.723 --> 58:42.184
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

58:42.727 --> 58:47.689
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

58:51.778 --> 58:53.403
Woman.

58:59.536 --> 59:01.787
This better be earth-shattering.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.836
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

59:10.004 --> 59:12.047
- Raoul.
- To Raoul.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.383
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

59:56.259 --> 59:58.552
Here's how we found her.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.850
- How old?
- Sixteen, seventeen.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.060
Been here about six hours.

01:00:07.228 --> 01:00:08.687
How'd she die, Rachel?

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:12.274
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:16.236
Who's that?

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.489
- Mother and siblings, I guess.
- What the hell they doing here?

01:00:19.657 --> 01:00:23.368
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:25.704
Okay, let's go.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:31.585
That's nice.

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:35.881
When I run a DNA check on the semen,
my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:39.259
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.554
- Sheriff"s Homicide getting anywhere?
- Not yet.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.557
- Get her.
- Get off me. Get off me.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.225
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:00:48.227 --> 01:00:49.895
- Oh, my God.
- Hold it, hold it.

01:00:53.941 --> 01:00:57.444
- Where is she?
- Easy, easy, easy.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.907
Please. Please, come on.

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.621
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Who did this?

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.832
Where's my baby? Where is she?

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.378
I need to know what happened.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:58.380
I guess the Earth shattered.

01:01:58.631 --> 01:02:02.384
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:07.347
I didn't wanna ruin their
night too. What was it?

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:10.809
You don't wanna know.

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:13.311
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:16.940
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:20.819
You never told me I'd be excluded.

01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:26.283
I told you when we hooked up, baby,
that you were gonna have to share me...

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:30.203
...with all the bad people and all
the ugly events on this planet.

01:02:30.371 --> 01:02:34.791
And I bought into that
sharing because I love you.

01:02:34.959 --> 01:02:40.881
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,
driving a bus. I don't care.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:44.259
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.970
That's sharing. This is not sharing,
this is leftovers.

01:02:47.138 --> 01:02:50.140
Oh, I see. What I should do is,
uh, come home and say:

01:02:50.683 --> 01:02:54.186
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

01:02:54.353 --> 01:02:58.106
...where this junkie asshole just
fried his baby in a microwave...

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:01.902
...because it was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

01:03:02.069 --> 01:03:04.905
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:11.077
...we'll somehow, uh, cathartically
dispel all that heinous shit." Right?

01:03:13.706 --> 01:03:16.082
Wrong. You know why?

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:20.796
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.507
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

01:03:23.716 --> 01:03:28.720
I preserve it, because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.056
Where I gotta be.

01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:39.898
You don't live with me.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:45.320
You live among the remains of dead people.

01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:49.950
You read the terrain.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:54.454
You search for signs of passing...

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:56.665
...for the scent of your prey...

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.625
...and then you hunt them down.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:03.839
That's the only thing you're committed to.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.928
The rest is the mess you
leave as you pass through.

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:18.520
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:36.288
Hey. Miss Lillian.

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.041
Let's go, baby.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:46.339
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:49.676
I did time for what that
motherfucker does every day.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:54.264
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.600
Can you do that?

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.646
Ain't a hard time been
invented that I cannot handle.

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:09.946
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.450
Because I'm proud of you.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.875
- You're proud of me?
- Mm-hm.

01:05:25.504 --> 01:05:28.089
What the hell you proud of me for?

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.051
Come on home.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.814
- What were you doing there?
- I was skiing.

01:05:44.982 --> 01:05:47.192
I was trying to ski.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:51.154
That's what people do there.
You go skiing and you, um...

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.239
...you meet people.

01:05:53.407 --> 01:05:54.908
You try to have a good time.

01:05:55.076 --> 01:05:56.743
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.036
Why not?

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:00.538
I'm not good at meeting people.

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.624
You met me.

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:05.710
Well, that happened without
my thinking about it.

01:06:05.878 --> 01:06:08.380
Which is why, probably.

01:06:08.547 --> 01:06:11.091
No, it's because you were fine.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.678
Eady.

01:06:15.846 --> 01:06:18.390
Take off with me for a while.

01:06:19.225 --> 01:06:21.393
- Where?
- New Zealand.

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.063
When?

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:28.608
I have to go separate,
but you could meet me there.

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:30.777
But my job, my...

01:06:30.945 --> 01:06:35.782
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio, do work there.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:38.785
- I don't know.
- What's there to know?

01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.912
Are you married?

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.581
- What?
- You come and go...

01:06:43.749 --> 01:06:45.375
The last thing I am is married.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:48.586
I'm a needle starting at zero going
the other way, a double blank.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.588
Then, all of a sudden...

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:53.800
...someone like you comes along.

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:59.973
- You don't know me, Neil.
- I know enough.

01:07:03.602 --> 01:07:05.520
Come with me.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.948
What's wrong, baby?

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:21.411
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:27.500
Yeah.

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:32.380
Good.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.948
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hi.

01:07:59.366 --> 01:08:02.327
What happened? You forget
your mom was picking you up?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:05.288
No.

01:08:06.582 --> 01:08:08.666
So, what's going on?

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.378
I felt like being alone.

01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.008
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

01:08:21.846 --> 01:08:25.517
- Hey, Mike.
- Hey, Lauren.

01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:14.732
What's happening?

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:17.734
Lieutenant. Sir.

01:09:17.903 --> 01:09:20.529
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.700
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.589
Technique.

01:10:38.525 --> 01:10:41.027
Open sesame. Right there.

01:11:38.294 --> 01:11:40.295
There he goes.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.108
- We walk.
- I'm right there.

01:12:44.276 --> 01:12:46.277
We walk! Now! Come on.

01:12:57.915 --> 01:13:02.126
He's heard it.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:12.220
Heads up.

01:13:13.305 --> 01:13:15.014
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, captain.

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:18.810
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything.
- Yeah, I see.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:24.190
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:26.859
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.

01:13:35.953 --> 01:13:38.579
- Okay, let them go.
- What?

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:41.165
What are you gonna take them on?
Breaking and entry?

01:13:41.333 --> 01:13:43.418
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.837
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...

01:13:46.004 --> 01:13:48.506
...they do six months and
they're out. No fucking way.

01:13:48.674 --> 01:13:51.801
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They're not walking.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:55.638
That's exactly what they're gonna do.
They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:58.182
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

01:13:58.350 --> 01:14:02.478
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.734
Back to work.

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:54.739
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the
fuck did this heat come from?

01:14:54.907 --> 01:14:56.574
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:15:00.203
The place, not us. Because it's been
hit a couple of times, you know.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.039
Assume they got our phones,
assume they got our houses...

01:15:03.207 --> 01:15:05.708
...assume they got us right here,
right now as we sit.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:07.835
Everything. Assume it all.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.087
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

01:15:10.255 --> 01:15:13.424
- I'll front that. That's not a problem.
- What happens to Van Zant?

01:15:13.592 --> 01:15:17.595
With the heat we got, do you wanna play
World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

01:15:17.763 --> 01:15:19.680
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

01:15:19.848 --> 01:15:24.185
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:26.771
Our problem is, take the
bank or split right now?

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:29.440
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:32.777
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.195
That's it.

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.947
Chris.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:41.285
The bank is won'th the risk.

01:15:41.453 --> 01:15:43.454
I need it, brother.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.292
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:01.889
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:05.518
No, not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.491
You figure this is
the best thing to do?

01:16:20.909 --> 01:16:22.493
This is the best thing to do?

01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:26.914
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for
me the reward is maybe won'th the stretch.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.001
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:31.669
You got T-bonds, real estate.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:35.214
If I were you, I would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

01:16:53.483 --> 01:16:57.361
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.

01:16:57.529 --> 01:16:58.571
I'm in.

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:05.411
- You too?
- Yeah, sure.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:07.830
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's go.

01:17:07.998 --> 01:17:09.874
Fuck them, let's do it.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.627
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:27.975
- You can't go in there.
- Watch this.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:30.311
- Excuse me...
- Tim, I gotta call you back.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:31.979
You have to have an appointment.

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.939
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

01:17:34.107 --> 01:17:35.983
- Yeah, and who the fuck are you?
- Who am I?

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:39.820
- Ow! Hey. Hey.
- Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:43.240
L.A.? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

01:17:43.408 --> 01:17:46.911
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you
guys think you're pushing around...

01:17:47.079 --> 01:17:52.416
- ...but I know people here, okay?
- Las Vegas P.D. Takes you into custody.

01:17:53.043 --> 01:17:56.045
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant...

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:59.465
...for smuggling cigarettes up from
North Carolina three years ago...

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:01.801
...or you go to work for us.

01:18:01.968 --> 01:18:03.761
Cut and dried.

01:18:03.929 --> 01:18:06.764
- That is it.
- Oh, shit.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:09.684
Charlene Shiherlis.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:11.602
- Who?
- Who?

01:18:12.145 --> 01:18:13.938
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

01:18:14.314 --> 01:18:17.942
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:20.361
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:24.448
Who needs to? Your ass is on a
plane back to New Jersey, jack off.

01:18:24.616 --> 01:18:28.494
Oh, man, I just... Why did I
get mixed up with that bitch?

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:31.372
Because she got a great ass!

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.043
And you got your head
all the way up it.

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:37.628
Jesus.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:43.801
When I think of asses, a womars ass...

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.303
...something comes out of me.

01:18:47.681 --> 01:18:49.807
- So?
- So no big thing.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:55.020
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

01:18:55.188 --> 01:18:57.481
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:04.739
- San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
- Uh-huh.

01:19:04.906 --> 01:19:07.575
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:08.868
Right.

01:19:09.035 --> 01:19:11.871
The security systems around here are a joke.

01:19:16.501 --> 01:19:19.170
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's Escape Route Number 1.

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:23.340
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.842
- Good.
- Okay?

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:27.720
- Yeah. That's fine.
- Got it? Good. Let's go.

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.703
They were looking back...

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:55.206
...in this direction.

01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.374
A container facility?

01:19:57.542 --> 01:20:02.087
- For a can'tage theft?
- Too visible. Too lowball for them.

01:20:05.217 --> 01:20:08.219
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:11.055
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around.

01:20:11.389 --> 01:20:12.890
Same for the scrap yard.

01:20:16.394 --> 01:20:18.604
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

01:20:21.858 --> 01:20:25.069
A refinery and a scrap yard.

01:20:25.403 --> 01:20:29.073
- What the hell is going on?
- That's what we're trying to figure out.

01:20:30.075 --> 01:20:32.076
We thought we had it.

01:20:32.869 --> 01:20:33.911
Thought we had it.

01:20:43.588 --> 01:20:48.133
I got an idea of what they were looking at.

01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:54.348
- You wanna know what they're looking at?
- What?

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:59.144
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

01:21:00.272 --> 01:21:03.190
This crew is good.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:06.527
You know what they were looking at?

01:21:06.945 --> 01:21:08.112
What?

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.031
Us.

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.951
The L.A.P.D.

01:21:14.119 --> 01:21:16.495
The police department.

01:21:17.163 --> 01:21:19.290
We just got made.

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:28.507
Yeah.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.475
Okay.

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:48.694
Okay, motherfucker!

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.008
Kelso come through?

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:14.345
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:23.187
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:27.733
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:30.861
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

01:22:31.029 --> 01:22:33.364
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.

01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:37.618
Hanna's a hot dog.
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.912
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crime Unit.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.374
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:45.793
And he was a fucking maniac.

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:50.214
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:53.384
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:57.554
The Vice sergeant...

01:22:58.598 --> 01:23:00.891
...says Hanna likes you.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:04.979
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:07.898
Look how sharp this
guy is to figure that.

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.069
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.

01:23:12.237 --> 01:23:15.531
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

01:23:15.907 --> 01:23:18.409
Means the man is one of those guys out there...

01:23:18.576 --> 01:23:21.495
...prowling around all night,
dedicated.

01:23:23.748 --> 01:23:26.000
With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass.

01:23:33.383 --> 01:23:34.758
It's won'th the stretch.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:40.597
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.766
You sure?

01:23:43.184 --> 01:23:45.102
I'm sure.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:51.775
Let's go to the garage.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.833
Justine.

01:24:12.630 --> 01:24:14.590
Justine?

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.264
Where we going?

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.355
- Okay, where are you going?
- Out.

01:25:28.706 --> 01:25:31.708
- What are you on?
- TAC 9.

01:25:55.733 --> 01:25:58.443
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?

01:25:58.778 --> 01:26:02.364
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40.
Richard Glover's with me.

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:06.702
It's on the 105 eastbound
approaching the 110 interchange.

01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:09.163
You running a revolving tail?

01:26:09.330 --> 01:26:11.748
Yeah, I got two units in front,
three behind.

01:26:11.916 --> 01:26:15.961
Okay, have one of them pick
me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.546
Let's go.

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:11.516
Am I 100, uh, yards,
or what? Am I close or far, or what?

01:27:11.684 --> 01:27:14.269
Three hundred yards, center lane.

01:28:20.878 --> 01:28:22.713
How you doing?

01:28:25.883 --> 01:28:28.927
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

01:28:35.059 --> 01:28:38.353
- Yeah, sure. Let's go.
- Follow me.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.580
Seven years in Folsom.

01:28:56.748 --> 01:28:58.582
In the hole for three.

01:28:58.750 --> 01:29:00.042
McNeil before that.

01:29:03.629 --> 01:29:05.964
McNeil as tough as they say?

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.717
You looking to become a penologist?

01:29:09.969 --> 01:29:13.096
You're looking to go back? You know,
I chase down some crews...

01:29:13.264 --> 01:29:17.684
...guys just looking to fuck up,
get busted back. That you?

01:29:18.394 --> 01:29:20.604
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

01:29:21.397 --> 01:29:23.607
I worked all kinds.

01:29:26.611 --> 01:29:29.154
You see me doing thrill-seeking
liquor-store holdups...

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:31.656
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

01:29:31.824 --> 01:29:34.659
- No, I do not.
- Right.

01:29:35.828 --> 01:29:37.662
I am never going back.

01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:41.541
Then don't take down scores.

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:45.337
I do what I do best, I take scores.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:49.132
You do what you do best,
trying to stop guys like me.

01:29:52.345 --> 01:29:55.180
So you never wanted
a regular-type life?

01:29:55.348 --> 01:29:58.350
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

01:30:00.103 --> 01:30:01.228
Yeah.

01:30:03.689 --> 01:30:08.902
- This regular-type life like your life?
- My life? No, my life...

01:30:09.862 --> 01:30:11.822
No, my life's a disaster zone.

01:30:13.574 --> 01:30:16.410
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.663
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

01:30:19.831 --> 01:30:23.708
I got a wife. We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage...

01:30:23.876 --> 01:30:25.752
...my third...

01:30:27.171 --> 01:30:30.841
...because I spend all my time chasing
guys like you around the block.

01:30:31.008 --> 01:30:33.051
That's my life.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:44.646
"Don't let yourself get attached to anything...

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:47.524
...you are not willing to walk
out on in 30 seconds flat...

01:30:47.692 --> 01:30:49.860
...if you feel the heat
around the corner."

01:30:50.903 --> 01:30:54.322
Now, if you're on me,
and you gotta move when I move...

01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:57.659
...how do you expect to keep a... A marriage?

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:01.705
Well, that's an interesting point.

01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:05.083
What are you, a monk?

01:31:05.334 --> 01:31:07.043
I have a woman.

01:31:07.211 --> 01:31:09.212
What do you tell her?

01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:13.175
I tell her I'm a salesman.

01:31:19.515 --> 01:31:23.059
So then, if you spot me
coming around that corner...

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:26.229
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

01:31:27.023 --> 01:31:29.191
Not say goodbye?

01:31:29.442 --> 01:31:31.693
That's the discipline.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.820
That's pretty vacant, no?

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:35.655
Yeah, it is what it is.

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:38.450
It's that, or we both better
go do something else, pal.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:42.370
I don't know how to do anything else.

01:31:42.955 --> 01:31:44.831
Neither do I.

01:31:47.293 --> 01:31:50.754
- I don't much want to either.
- Neither do I.

01:31:58.429 --> 01:32:02.015
You know, I have this, uh, recurring dream.

01:32:02.975 --> 01:32:05.644
I'm sitting at this
big banquet table...

01:32:05.811 --> 01:32:09.689
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table...

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:14.110
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

01:32:14.278 --> 01:32:19.282
...because they got eight-ball
hemorrhages from the head wounds.

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:23.119
And there they are, these big balloon people...

01:32:23.287 --> 01:32:26.373
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:30.043
The neighbors reported the smell...

01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:34.589
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.342
What do they say?

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:40.804
Nothing.

01:32:40.972 --> 01:32:42.639
- No talk?
- None.

01:32:42.807 --> 01:32:46.434
Just... They don't have anything to say.

01:32:47.061 --> 01:32:49.479
See, we just look at each other.

01:32:49.939 --> 01:32:54.776
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:59.531
I have one where I'm drowning.

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:03.368
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing,
or I'll die in my sleep.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.955
You know what that's about?

01:33:07.456 --> 01:33:10.166
Yeah. Having enough time.

01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:16.923
- Enough time to do what you wanna do?
- That's right.

01:33:18.884 --> 01:33:22.512
- You doing it now?
- No, not yet.

01:33:27.393 --> 01:33:29.686
You know, we're sitting here...

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.647
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.

01:33:32.815 --> 01:33:35.734
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

01:33:38.029 --> 01:33:41.031
And now that we've
been face to face...

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:48.330
...if I'm there and I gotta
put you away, I won't like it.

01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:49.831
But I'll tell you...

01:33:52.376 --> 01:33:55.879
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:58.548
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

01:33:59.383 --> 01:34:03.720
...brother, you are going down.

01:34:15.441 --> 01:34:18.276
There's a flip side to that coin.

01:34:20.071 --> 01:34:24.407
What if you do got me boxed
in and I gotta put you down?

01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:30.413
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

01:34:31.123 --> 01:34:34.042
We've been face to face, yeah...

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:40.757
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.

01:34:46.597 --> 01:34:48.932
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:53.895
Or who knows?

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:56.856
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.915
They dumped us.

01:35:15.251 --> 01:35:16.543
What?

01:35:16.711 --> 01:35:20.004
- They dumped us.
- What do you mean, they dumped us?

01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:21.256
Chris slipped his tail.

01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:23.883
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:26.761
...so there's nothing for me
to get from Marciano. I tried.

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:29.180
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

01:35:29.348 --> 01:35:32.100
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:38.982
- They dumped all our surveillance?
- Yeah, at the same time. Nine p.m.

01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:43.319
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:45.822
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:48.992
...where surveillance can't fly
over because of flight paths.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:52.495
His car's still there. He's gone.

01:35:56.917 --> 01:36:02.881
Does anybody have any idea where
the fuck these people are?

01:37:01.524 --> 01:37:03.233
You hear from him yet?

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.862
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:14.661
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

01:37:19.834 --> 01:37:20.875
Who are you?

01:37:22.127 --> 01:37:25.922
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.676
I've been living in this office day and night.
How well do you know him?

01:37:30.427 --> 01:37:33.930
Oh, we took some major
scores together.

01:37:36.892 --> 01:37:38.935
How come I haven't heard from him?

01:37:39.103 --> 01:37:42.939
Well, he's probably busy right now,
but he's real thorough.

01:37:44.358 --> 01:37:48.236
- He ain't gonna forget about you.
- Oh, that's reassuring.

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:53.157
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:56.619
Probably be a big help to you.

01:38:17.641 --> 01:38:18.975
You recognize the grill man?

01:38:27.151 --> 01:38:31.446
- No.
- Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

01:38:32.865 --> 01:38:36.659
- Ain't got my break yet, man.
- Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

01:38:36.827 --> 01:38:39.829
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:41.956
Take your break later.

01:38:42.124 --> 01:38:45.460
Piece of shit. Pick up.

01:38:48.213 --> 01:38:49.964
Where the hell is he?

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:53.468
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car.
- So did I.

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:00.058
Yeah?

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:02.769
Hang on.

01:39:03.145 --> 01:39:05.063
- Yeah.
- Hey.

01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:09.776
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:11.194
All right.

01:39:22.081 --> 01:39:24.207
- Where are you?
- There's cops all over me, man.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:28.378
They're on me like a cheap suit.
I can't dump them.

01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:34.842
- After the fact you spotted them?
- No, no. They're doing parallels.

01:39:37.721 --> 01:39:39.138
I can try to dump them again.

01:39:39.306 --> 01:39:43.685
How are we gonna know if you did?
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

01:39:44.061 --> 01:39:45.979
Head for Ventura.
Pull them out of here.

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:50.233
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.
Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:14.841
Come on, man.

01:40:16.385 --> 01:40:18.052
Pick up.

01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:21.848
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up?
- What's up, brother?

01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:24.392
Man, what you doing here?

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:28.312
What I am doing is I'm looking for a
driver who can handle scanners and a radio.

01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:31.107
Right now, today.
You remember the drill?

01:40:31.275 --> 01:40:34.152
- Yeah, man, sure.
- You cool?

01:40:34.570 --> 01:40:36.779
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

01:40:36.947 --> 01:40:40.283
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:56.507
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

01:40:57.843 --> 01:40:59.969
Out back in five.

01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:11.606
- What's burning? What's burning?
- Nothing I'm doing.

01:41:11.774 --> 01:41:13.483
What is this?

01:41:13.650 --> 01:41:15.818
Where do you think you're going?

01:41:19.406 --> 01:41:23.034
Just came across a first edition
of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

01:41:23.202 --> 01:41:25.453
Yeah. No, it's in good condition.

01:41:25.621 --> 01:41:28.956
And it wjll not stop or
answer radio communication.

01:41:29.124 --> 01:41:32.502
The 180-foot vessel is
called Jin Yin Number 1...

01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:35.671
...and is suspected of smuggling
Chinese illegal aliens.

01:41:35.839 --> 01:41:37.840
It was spotted Saturday
by patrol aircraft.

01:42:50.247 --> 01:42:52.707
- Stay down.
- Don't move! Don't fucking move!

01:42:52.875 --> 01:42:56.252
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air! Put them up!

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:59.422
Down, down! Get on your knees.

01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.424
- Give me the keys.
- Get on your knees.

01:43:01.592 --> 01:43:03.384
Get on your knees!

01:43:06.388 --> 01:43:10.099
Hey. Hey! Get over there.
Get the fuck... Get down.

01:43:10.267 --> 01:43:12.768
Turn around! Put your hands
behind you. Behind you!

01:43:12.936 --> 01:43:14.896
Get down! Stay down!

01:43:15.814 --> 01:43:18.816
Get down! Get down! Down, you stupid son of a...

01:43:19.818 --> 01:43:22.945
- Down! Down, now!
- Keys! Keys! Keys!

01:43:26.617 --> 01:43:27.950
All of you stay down.

01:43:29.119 --> 01:43:32.455
We want to hurt no one. We're here
for the bank's money, not your money.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:35.124
Your money's insured.
You're not gonna lose a dime.

01:43:35.292 --> 01:43:39.128
Think of your families. Don't risk your life.
Don't try and be a hero.

01:43:39.296 --> 01:43:42.798
Right now I want you to sit on the
floor and put your hands on your head.

01:43:42.966 --> 01:43:47.470
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart trouble,
go ahead and lean against the wall.

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:50.848
- Give me the key.
- What key?

01:43:52.476 --> 01:43:55.519
Get down and stay down!

01:43:55.687 --> 01:43:58.314
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:09.325
Get down!

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:35.810
Hey. Hey!

01:44:44.111 --> 01:44:46.404
Put your head down.

01:44:47.489 --> 01:44:49.824
- Look at me again, I'll kill you.
- Stay down. Down.

01:44:49.992 --> 01:44:54.328
- Put your head down!
- Get down. Get down.

01:45:14.933 --> 01:45:16.684
- Hey, Casals.
- Yeah.

01:45:16.852 --> 01:45:19.228
You guys working a case on a Neil McCauley?

01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:23.691
This CI, Hugh Benny, called in about a
bank they're looking at or something.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:25.067
Vincent.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:28.738
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

01:45:46.131 --> 01:45:48.341
I want a block at Figueroa and 5th...

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:52.386
...and I want a block northbound Flower at 6th.

01:46:29.925 --> 01:46:31.467
They're already coming out.

01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:36.222
Okay, we're gonna have to take them in the car.
Wait till they are all in.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.849
Get clean shots.
Watch your background.

01:46:47.943 --> 01:46:49.652
- Police! Move!
- What's going on?

01:46:51.154 --> 01:46:52.822
Move. Move. Get down.

01:46:57.119 --> 01:46:58.160
Look out.

01:47:11.049 --> 01:47:13.050
- Move it, come on.
- L.A.P.D. Get down.

01:47:14.678 --> 01:47:16.011
Move it. Down, down, down.

01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:21.350
We did it, right, Neil? Huh?

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.647
- Move!
- Aah!

01:47:32.404 --> 01:47:34.029
Get down.

01:47:41.705 --> 01:47:44.331
- Fuck. Fuck!
- Start the car!

01:48:01.349 --> 01:48:02.850
Go! Go! Go!

01:48:25.624 --> 01:48:28.042
- Son of a bitch!
- Go, go!

01:49:03.036 --> 01:49:30.479
Go!

01:50:16.484 --> 01:50:18.193
Go!

01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:13.290
Come on. Come on. Ugh!

01:51:19.297 --> 01:51:21.465
Get him out of here.

01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:47.324
Get down! Now!

01:51:49.911 --> 01:51:51.495
Shit.

01:51:56.626 --> 01:51:58.460
Shit.

01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:04.133
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way!
Get them down! Now, now!

01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:06.510
No, out of the way. Out of the way.

01:52:55.685 --> 01:52:58.312
Mommy? Mommy!

01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.611
Come here, honey.

01:53:47.195 --> 01:53:48.237
Come on, honey.

01:53:50.824 --> 01:53:54.952
I got you. It's okay now.

01:53:56.204 --> 01:54:00.999
Tragedy in a Southland neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

01:54:01.167 --> 01:54:04.336
Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?

01:54:04.504 --> 01:54:08.257
This afternoon, this neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

01:54:08.424 --> 01:54:12.261
With the streets full of mid-day shoppers
and kids, police and armed robbers...

01:54:12.428 --> 01:54:15.097
- Excuse me, bartender?
- One minute, lady.

01:54:15.265 --> 01:54:17.808
- -
- Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

01:54:17.976 --> 01:54:21.103
A Los Angeles neighborhood is
shaken by a bank robbery...

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:23.856
...that ended in homicide and terror.

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:27.818
One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one of
four men involved in the foiled robbery.

01:54:27.986 --> 01:54:30.279
- He died at the scene.
- What can I get you, miss?

01:54:30.446 --> 01:54:32.781
Also fatally wounded, suspect Donald Breedan...

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:34.449
Miss?

01:54:34.617 --> 01:54:38.453
During the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.

01:54:39.956 --> 01:54:41.999
- Ugh. Un!
- All right, hold him. Hold him.

01:54:42.166 --> 01:54:43.667
- All right. All right.
- It's all right.

01:54:51.843 --> 01:54:54.469
- So?
- Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

01:54:54.637 --> 01:54:59.182
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine
for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

01:54:59.350 --> 01:55:01.059
Bottom line.

01:55:01.227 --> 01:55:05.314
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good,
but his, uh, clavicle's fractured.

01:55:05.481 --> 01:55:08.400
- Can he rest for a while?
- Six, seven hours.

01:55:08.568 --> 01:55:10.360
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:55:10.528 --> 01:55:12.779
- Take off your shirt.
- What?

01:55:14.699 --> 01:55:16.658
Take off your shirt.

01:55:22.999 --> 01:55:26.084
My... Look, my daughter gave
it to me for Father's Day.

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:29.171
I don't give a shit who
gave it to you. Take it off.

01:55:34.636 --> 01:55:37.012
Chris. Hey.

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:41.808
- Chris, listen to me.
- Mm.

01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:46.188
Nate's gonna pick you up.
He's gonna take you to his place.

01:55:47.690 --> 01:55:50.192
- Where's Charlene?
- We gotta get out of here.

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.152
We're all over the 6:00 news.

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.656
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'm not going without her.

01:55:55.823 --> 01:55:59.201
Think about that. I will meet you at Nate's.

01:55:59.369 --> 01:56:00.494
Where are you going?

01:56:00.662 --> 01:56:04.957
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

01:56:05.208 --> 01:56:06.875
Who did it?

01:56:07.710 --> 01:56:09.252
Who wasrt there?

01:56:10.254 --> 01:56:12.089
Trejo.

01:56:15.551 --> 01:56:16.718
I'll see you at Nate's.

01:56:23.518 --> 01:56:24.559
Yeah.

01:56:25.895 --> 01:56:26.937
Yeah. You still want me?

01:56:27.105 --> 01:56:31.358
You come down here right now and you get me.
Dominick and me. Okay?

01:56:31.526 --> 01:56:35.404
Okay, baby, okay. I'll be
there in two hours, all right?

01:56:35.571 --> 01:56:37.823
- Okay?
- All right.

01:56:39.409 --> 01:56:42.953
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

01:56:43.454 --> 01:56:47.374
- You're on a plane for Los Angeles.
- Great.

01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:37.340
Why'd you do it? What happened?

01:57:38.843 --> 01:57:40.552
- They made me.
- Who?

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.471
Where's Anna?

01:57:42.972 --> 01:57:44.014
She's dead.

01:57:47.226 --> 01:57:50.312
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

01:57:50.813 --> 01:57:54.983
- Who did it? Who did it?
- They had Anna, man.

01:57:55.151 --> 01:57:56.902
Who had her?

01:57:57.653 --> 01:58:01.281
Waingro.

01:58:01.532 --> 01:58:02.657
On his own?

01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:06.870
- For someone.
- Who?

01:58:07.038 --> 01:58:09.372
The other he worked for.

01:58:11.292 --> 01:58:13.210
Zant.

01:58:15.379 --> 01:58:18.757
- Van Zant?
- Yeah.

01:58:18.925 --> 01:58:20.759
Van Zant.

01:58:20.927 --> 01:58:24.012
- Are you sure?
- Van Zant.

01:58:25.890 --> 01:58:28.683
Did you say anything about
how we're getting out?

01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:32.354
- I don't think so, Neil.
- Come on.

01:58:34.357 --> 01:58:35.982
I don't remember, Neil.

01:58:41.489 --> 01:58:45.200
- I'll call a medic.
- I'm not gonna make it.

01:58:46.702 --> 01:58:49.746
I can't feel nothing.

01:58:51.124 --> 01:58:54.042
My Anna's gone.

01:58:55.211 --> 01:58:57.462
She's gone.

01:58:58.881 --> 01:59:03.176
Don't leave me like this, Neil. Please, holmes.

01:59:04.512 --> 01:59:07.222
Don't leave me like this.

01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:32.789
- Yeah?
- Nate.

01:59:33.416 --> 01:59:36.084
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

01:59:36.711 --> 01:59:37.878
It's a new one.

01:59:39.422 --> 01:59:42.215
The guy lives on
Hillside Terrace, Encino.

01:59:42.383 --> 01:59:45.719
- 10725.
- 10725, okay.

01:59:45.887 --> 01:59:49.097
- Chris?
- He's with me, at my place.

01:59:49.265 --> 01:59:51.600
Next, Waingro, okay?

01:59:53.728 --> 01:59:54.811
You got the time?

01:59:55.855 --> 01:59:59.149
I'll make time, and I need a new out laid on.

02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:01.276
How do you know it's blown?

02:00:02.945 --> 02:00:05.071
How can I trust it?

02:00:07.742 --> 02:00:09.618
Okay, you got it.

02:00:09.785 --> 02:00:11.828
Stay healthy.

02:00:16.918 --> 02:00:18.793
Charlene Shiherlis.

02:00:19.545 --> 02:00:22.339
Drucker's got a safe house
in Venice to stash her in.

02:00:22.506 --> 02:00:25.717
Our Neil's transportation.
When we're done here, get on the phone.

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:28.428
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

02:00:28.596 --> 02:00:30.972
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway?

02:00:31.140 --> 02:00:35.518
Sure he did. Now he needs another one.
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:38.897
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

02:00:39.065 --> 02:00:42.609
He's a CI for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

02:00:42.777 --> 02:00:46.321
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

02:00:46.489 --> 02:00:49.866
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out.
After that, he's gone.

02:00:50.034 --> 02:00:51.993
Bye-bye. Bam.

02:01:44.839 --> 02:01:49.259
You ratted McCauley to us.
How'd you know? Who told you?

02:01:49.427 --> 02:01:52.053
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:53.847
Who?

02:02:21.751 --> 02:02:25.128
Connelly back in for Murphy.
Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

02:02:25.296 --> 02:02:27.088
Murphy tees it up behind the net...

02:02:31.260 --> 02:02:34.471
Miller out front. Now here's
Murphy with the referee...

02:02:38.059 --> 02:02:39.225
Waingro, where is he?

02:02:40.603 --> 02:02:42.854
- Where is he?
- How the hell would I know?

02:03:08.631 --> 02:03:12.550
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

02:03:13.010 --> 02:03:16.638
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty. Aah!

02:03:19.100 --> 02:03:22.143
- You slimy piece of shit.
- You told me you wanted out from under.

02:03:22.311 --> 02:03:25.480
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

02:03:25.648 --> 02:03:29.317
- Yeah, what's your end?
- L... You stupid broad.

02:03:29.485 --> 02:03:31.945
- How'd I get into this?
- Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

02:03:32.113 --> 02:03:33.321
- Huh?
- You heard me.

02:03:33.489 --> 02:03:36.533
She had a rough ride. Why don't
you fix her a drink or something?

02:03:36.700 --> 02:03:39.702
- Look in the cabinet above the sink.
- Fuck her.

02:03:42.123 --> 02:03:45.250
- You'd better get in there and stay in there.
- All right, all right.

02:03:48.003 --> 02:03:50.255
Well, lookie here.

02:03:51.424 --> 02:03:53.716
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.

02:03:53.884 --> 02:03:57.887
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom?
- He stays with me.

02:03:58.389 --> 02:04:00.306
There we go.

02:04:07.898 --> 02:04:09.858
So, what now?

02:04:12.111 --> 02:04:15.864
Well, he's right,
because you want out, this is out.

02:04:17.283 --> 02:04:21.161
- You believe you have to betray Chris.
- No shit.

02:04:21.328 --> 02:04:24.289
That's right. You would have to.

02:04:24.457 --> 02:04:28.710
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

02:04:29.211 --> 02:04:32.422
Because he becomes an orphan when
you go to prison as an accessory...

02:04:32.590 --> 02:04:35.049
...because you got no
living parents to take him.

02:04:35.217 --> 02:04:39.596
So he ends up state-raised in
foster homes, juvenile facilities.

02:04:39.763 --> 02:04:42.015
Then he steals a car.

02:04:42.266 --> 02:04:47.437
Then he winds up in gladiator
academies like Chino and Tracy.

02:04:47.605 --> 02:04:50.899
Fucked for life.

02:04:51.066 --> 02:04:54.402
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

02:04:55.571 --> 02:05:00.742
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

02:05:01.827 --> 02:05:05.413
If you give up Chris,
you get off clean.

02:05:05.581 --> 02:05:09.501
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

02:05:13.672 --> 02:05:17.050
- What else are you selling?
- All kinds of shit.

02:05:17.927 --> 02:05:23.139
But I don't have to sell this and you know it,
because this kind of shit here sells itself.

02:05:29.438 --> 02:05:31.439
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

02:05:31.607 --> 02:05:34.943
- Drucker's on Line 2.
- Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

02:05:37.112 --> 02:05:39.239
Lieutenant, I have Drucker on the other line.

02:05:39.406 --> 02:05:40.782
Oh, well, conference him in.

02:05:42.284 --> 02:05:45.995
- Go ahead.
- Vincent, it's me.

02:05:47.915 --> 02:05:50.542
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

02:05:57.132 --> 02:05:59.634
We're set here. She'll make the call.

02:05:59.802 --> 02:06:02.971
Okay, that's good.
Here's the deal here.

02:06:03.138 --> 02:06:08.977
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life
and become a born-again good citizen.

02:06:09.144 --> 02:06:13.690
Apparently, Neil got sold out to
us by this cowboy named Waingro.

02:06:13.857 --> 02:06:16.609
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...

02:06:16.777 --> 02:06:20.363
...then he went to work for a
money launderer named Van Zant.

02:06:20.531 --> 02:06:26.327
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

02:06:26.662 --> 02:06:29.998
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be Waingro.

02:06:30.165 --> 02:06:33.501
Waingro just got himself a
suite at the airport Marquis...

02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:37.046
...under the name "Jameson." He's there now.

02:06:37.214 --> 02:06:40.300
I want you to get that to
bail bondsmen, bookies...

02:06:40.467 --> 02:06:43.678
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

02:06:43.846 --> 02:06:46.222
Anyone you can think of
who'll put it on the street.

02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:50.560
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally
check their coms every 30 minutes.

02:06:50.728 --> 02:06:54.814
Because maybe Neil will go for him.
Okay? How you feeling?

02:06:55.524 --> 02:06:58.776
- Banged up, but I'll live.
- Okay.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:08.036
He's here.

02:07:08.329 --> 02:07:10.538
Neil is still here.

02:07:11.081 --> 02:07:13.041
I can feel it.

02:07:13.292 --> 02:07:15.835
- But for how long?
- Uh...

02:07:16.420 --> 02:07:19.339
Seven, eight hours, max.

02:07:27.723 --> 02:07:29.057
What did you do?

02:07:29.767 --> 02:07:33.478
- That was you?
- It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

02:07:33.646 --> 02:07:36.564
Would have been okay,
you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

02:07:36.732 --> 02:07:40.735
- Now we gotta go together.
- Those other people were with you?

02:07:42.863 --> 02:07:44.989
My friend, Michael...

02:07:46.075 --> 02:07:48.701
...he knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

02:07:52.706 --> 02:07:55.333
It rains, you get wet.

02:07:57.378 --> 02:07:58.586
Get packed and let's go.

02:08:05.761 --> 02:08:08.429
Eady.

02:08:18.190 --> 02:08:21.442
Why did you do this to me?

02:08:26.949 --> 02:08:28.991
Who are you?

02:08:31.829 --> 02:08:34.956
It's gonna be all right.
You understand? Lt'll be all right.

02:08:39.837 --> 02:08:41.963
It's gonna be all right.

02:08:42.965 --> 02:08:44.590
Right.

02:08:53.183 --> 02:08:56.811
There's this Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

02:09:01.525 --> 02:09:03.568
Here's some cash.

02:09:06.155 --> 02:09:07.321
Whers it over?

02:09:10.826 --> 02:09:12.368
Twenty-two hours from now.

02:09:12.828 --> 02:09:16.539
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

02:09:20.461 --> 02:09:23.337
Go now. You want out?
There's the door.

02:09:24.006 --> 02:09:26.174
Will you let me leave later?

02:09:31.263 --> 02:09:33.473
It will be different.

02:09:34.516 --> 02:09:36.684
Do you understand?

02:10:07.174 --> 02:10:08.716
It's ready.

02:10:08.884 --> 02:10:10.718
Vincent.

02:10:16.141 --> 02:10:18.309
This is my friend Ralph.

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.436
You didn't tell me you were...

02:10:21.522 --> 02:10:24.398
- Oh, my God.
- Where's Lauren?

02:10:24.566 --> 02:10:27.777
- She's at Lisa-Beth's.
- Look, this has nothing to do with me.

02:10:27.945 --> 02:10:31.864
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
- What are you sorry about? Sit down.

02:10:32.533 --> 02:10:34.575
Don't you even get angry?

02:10:34.743 --> 02:10:37.245
- I'm angry, yeah.
- Oh.

02:10:37.412 --> 02:10:39.831
I'm very angry, Ralph.

02:10:39.998 --> 02:10:43.084
You know, you can ball my
wife if she wants you to.

02:10:44.670 --> 02:10:47.755
You can lounge around
here on her sofa.

02:10:49.091 --> 02:10:51.384
In her ex-husband's...

02:10:51.552 --> 02:10:56.597
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house, if you want to...

02:10:58.433 --> 02:11:04.772
...but you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

02:11:04.940 --> 02:11:06.440
For God's sake.

02:11:12.990 --> 02:11:14.782
Put the television set down.

02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:17.493
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

02:11:17.661 --> 02:11:19.954
- I should have?
- In a way, you're a party to this.

02:11:20.122 --> 02:11:23.165
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

02:11:23.333 --> 02:11:24.500
Our situation is absurd.

02:11:26.211 --> 02:11:31.048
- Look, maybe I should...
- Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

02:11:33.135 --> 02:11:37.054
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

02:11:37.222 --> 02:11:41.058
- I say what I mean, and I do what I say.
- Mm, how admirable.

02:11:41.226 --> 02:11:43.311
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

02:11:44.146 --> 02:11:45.187
No.

02:11:46.648 --> 02:11:50.234
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:53.029
...but you've been walking
through our life dead.

02:11:53.196 --> 02:11:57.867
Now I have to demean myself with
Ralph just to get closure with you.

02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:12.715
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

02:12:13.342 --> 02:12:18.179
The plane, charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

02:12:18.347 --> 02:12:20.097
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

02:12:23.477 --> 02:12:27.188
Touches down, holds for you
five minutes, then splits.

02:12:27.356 --> 02:12:30.858
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

02:12:32.861 --> 02:12:35.196
- Hey, where's Chris?
- He's gone.

02:12:36.657 --> 02:12:37.698
What?

02:12:38.325 --> 02:12:40.868
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

02:12:41.036 --> 02:12:43.871
- Didrt you bring him here?
- Yeah, I brought him here.

02:12:44.331 --> 02:12:46.165
What happened?

02:12:46.333 --> 02:12:48.709
It's a free country, brother.

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:57.551
Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.

02:12:58.887 --> 02:13:00.554
All right.

02:13:23.120 --> 02:13:26.080
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

02:13:28.959 --> 02:13:31.168
I know life is short.

02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:34.046
Whatever time you get is luck.

02:13:36.258 --> 02:13:38.342
You wanna walk?

02:13:40.595 --> 02:13:42.888
You walk right now.

02:13:43.974 --> 02:13:46.100
Or on your own...

02:13:46.268 --> 02:13:49.311
On your own, you choose to come with me.

02:13:55.402 --> 02:13:57.445
All I know is...

02:13:59.239 --> 02:14:03.576
All I know is there's no point
in me going anywhere anymore...

02:14:04.119 --> 02:14:06.203
...if it's gonna be alone...

02:14:07.122 --> 02:14:08.914
...without you.

02:14:15.756 --> 02:14:17.339
Eady.

02:15:07.057 --> 02:15:09.517
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

02:15:10.227 --> 02:15:11.852
Okay, I'll hold.

02:15:14.523 --> 02:15:15.898
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

02:15:17.025 --> 02:15:18.859
- Yeah, do it.
- Shut up!

02:15:23.115 --> 02:15:25.825
Now, just one second at the window...

02:15:26.618 --> 02:15:28.369
...and it's all over.

02:17:18.355 --> 02:17:20.022
Hey, man.

02:17:20.272 --> 02:17:22.233
- Yeah?
- You know any, uh...

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:25.193
...place to rent around here?

02:17:26.279 --> 02:17:27.404
Yeah.

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:30.156
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell
Avenue got cards on the wall.

02:17:30.325 --> 02:17:31.367
Yeah, thanks.

02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:45.255
It's not him. It's not Chris.

02:17:52.931 --> 02:17:55.057
Unit 2, this is Command.

02:17:55.225 --> 02:17:57.893
Take him at the street
and check him out.

02:17:58.061 --> 02:17:59.561
10-4.

02:18:23.003 --> 02:18:24.962
- Sergeant?
- Yeah.

02:18:25.129 --> 02:18:27.715
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.

02:18:27.882 --> 02:18:31.635
Car's registered to the last
name Bukowski, first name Gene.

02:18:31.803 --> 02:18:34.680
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

02:18:37.392 --> 02:18:40.227
- Let him go.
- Roger.

02:18:40.395 --> 02:18:42.730
Thank you very much. Have a good evening.

02:18:44.482 --> 02:18:46.441
It's a no-go, Vince.

02:18:55.535 --> 02:18:58.329
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

02:18:58.495 --> 02:19:00.581
Yeah, that'd be nice.

02:19:30.570 --> 02:19:32.571
- Yeah?
- Yeah, what do you got?

02:19:32.739 --> 02:19:34.823
Nothing's happening.

02:19:46.127 --> 02:19:49.463
- Yeah?
- Hello, it's Vincent.

02:19:49.631 --> 02:19:50.631
What do you got?

02:19:50.799 --> 02:19:55.135
Nothing's going on.
Waingro went for ice. That's it.

02:20:03.478 --> 02:20:05.312
You know what?

02:20:07.315 --> 02:20:09.358
Neil is gone.

02:20:11.569 --> 02:20:13.195
Bam!

02:20:13.780 --> 02:20:17.199
- Flying like a bird.
- Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

02:20:19.494 --> 02:20:22.538
- We still got bait. Maybe some time!
- Got, got. What do we got?

02:20:22.705 --> 02:20:24.540
What do we got?

02:20:24.958 --> 02:20:27.626
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

02:20:28.336 --> 02:20:30.546
You were good.

02:20:31.631 --> 02:20:33.173
I'm going to the hotel.

02:20:34.592 --> 02:20:37.052
I'm gonna take a shower.

02:20:37.637 --> 02:20:41.140
Gonna sleep for a month.

02:22:51.062 --> 02:22:52.854
Over here.

02:22:59.529 --> 02:23:01.446
Come on, baby.

02:23:03.408 --> 02:23:05.701
Okay, okay.

02:23:09.163 --> 02:23:11.123
Shit.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.001
Let me tighten this.

02:23:19.507 --> 02:23:21.508
What a fucking waste.

02:23:21.676 --> 02:23:24.011
Okay, here.

02:23:24.846 --> 02:23:30.559
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.
Not you, baby. Not you.

02:23:35.398 --> 02:23:38.859
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren,
Lauren Gustafson.

02:23:39.027 --> 02:23:41.278
I'm supposed to be here with her.
But the police...

02:23:48.202 --> 02:23:51.371
- Help me. I need somebody to help...
- It's okay.

02:23:52.832 --> 02:23:54.416
I got you.

02:23:57.045 --> 02:23:58.211
I got you, baby.

02:23:59.547 --> 02:24:02.883
It'll be all right, honey.
I swear. It's okay, baby.

02:24:03.051 --> 02:24:07.095
Let's get a doctor! Let's go!
A doctor here! There's your mama.

02:24:07.263 --> 02:24:09.139
- Let's just calm down.
- Your mama's here.

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:11.141
- Is she on any drugs?
- No.

02:24:14.062 --> 02:24:16.855
I want you to get a trauma
surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

02:24:17.023 --> 02:24:20.275
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

02:24:20.443 --> 02:24:23.779
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

02:24:23.946 --> 02:24:25.656
- It's ready.
- Oh...

02:24:27.158 --> 02:24:30.327
- Whers the last time anybody saw her?
- I don't know.

02:24:30.495 --> 02:24:33.580
- Where did you find her?
- The bathtub.

02:24:33.748 --> 02:24:37.292
Call Respiratory stat. Give her
large-bore normal saline. Wide open.

02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:40.587
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units, O-negative.

02:24:40.755 --> 02:24:43.799
- Let's type and cross her for six.
- Looks like she's in sinus tach.

02:24:43.966 --> 02:24:45.842
Where is Respiratory?
We need more help.

02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:47.803
Can you have Respiratory come now?

02:24:47.970 --> 02:24:50.681
Let's have X-ray ready for
post-intubation chest x-ray.

02:24:55.687 --> 02:25:00.315
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and
she's in the recovery room now, okay?

02:25:00.483 --> 02:25:04.653
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will
be out to speak to you in a few moments.

02:25:04.821 --> 02:25:06.697
- She's okay?
- She's doing good.

02:25:06.864 --> 02:25:09.032
- She's gonna be okay.
- She's gonna be okay.

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:12.077
- Oh, my baby.
- She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

02:25:12.245 --> 02:25:15.372
- It's all right.
- Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:19.751
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

02:25:20.795 --> 02:25:22.629
There.

02:25:23.047 --> 02:25:25.966
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.

02:25:26.134 --> 02:25:28.176
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

02:25:28.344 --> 02:25:29.386
- You understand?
- Yeah.

02:25:29.554 --> 02:25:31.638
I ain't going anywhere.

02:25:44.485 --> 02:25:46.945
- Yeah?
- It's me.

02:25:47.530 --> 02:25:50.782
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.

02:25:50.992 --> 02:25:54.995
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody,
so that's in the trust.

02:25:55.163 --> 02:25:57.038
One other thing.

02:25:57.498 --> 02:25:59.082
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

02:25:59.917 --> 02:26:02.794
The guy you wanted checked into
the Marquis under "Jameson"...

02:26:02.962 --> 02:26:06.339
...if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

02:26:06.507 --> 02:26:10.260
- You figured right.
- So, so long, brother.

02:26:11.971 --> 02:26:13.930
You take it easy.

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:15.682
You're home free.

02:26:17.435 --> 02:26:19.394
Take it easy.

02:26:29.739 --> 02:26:32.491
- What is it?
- Nothing.

02:26:32.658 --> 02:26:34.201
Home free.

02:27:12.156 --> 02:27:15.075
- I gotta take care of something.
- Is there time?

02:27:16.077 --> 02:27:17.744
There's time.

02:27:46.148 --> 02:27:49.276
I'll be right back.
Just leave her running.

02:28:30.693 --> 02:28:33.153
- Regjstration.
- Yeah, this is Room Service.

02:28:33.321 --> 02:28:37.157
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up
his room number. Could you give it to me?

02:28:37.325 --> 02:28:39.200
- They're always doing that.
- Yeah, I know.

02:28:39.368 --> 02:28:42.454
- 1735.
- Thank you.

02:30:25.933 --> 02:30:27.642
Your attention, please.

02:30:27.810 --> 02:30:31.062
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:34.607
Please do not panic.
Please do not take the elevators.

02:30:38.612 --> 02:30:41.239
- Shit.
- Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

02:30:41.407 --> 02:30:44.993
I'm checking the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

02:30:49.290 --> 02:30:51.708
What about her dad? You want me to call him?

02:30:52.710 --> 02:30:55.545
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

02:30:57.006 --> 02:30:59.174
And she chose you.

02:31:01.177 --> 02:31:03.553
She picked your place.

02:31:05.097 --> 02:31:06.556
It's not right, what happened to her.

02:31:08.225 --> 02:31:09.559
No, it's not.

02:31:12.980 --> 02:31:15.023
Ugh, okay.

02:31:25.201 --> 02:31:27.327
Is there any way...

02:31:29.288 --> 02:31:31.790
...that it could work out between us?

02:31:34.168 --> 02:31:36.753
I wish I could say yes, you know.

02:31:36.921 --> 02:31:40.215
But in the end...

02:31:49.558 --> 02:31:54.229
All I am, is what I'm going after.

02:32:01.112 --> 02:32:04.030
I'm not what you want, Justine.

02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:17.127
Well, go on, if you have to.

02:32:17.294 --> 02:32:18.878
No.

02:32:19.171 --> 02:32:22.382
- I'll stay.
- No, I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

02:32:25.553 --> 02:32:27.554
Just be careful.

02:32:27.805 --> 02:32:30.557
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:33.017
Okay?

02:33:14.894 --> 02:33:15.935
Take the stairs.

02:33:29.909 --> 02:33:30.950
Yeah?

02:33:33.162 --> 02:33:37.332
Security. There's a fire on 3.
We have to evacuate all the floors.

02:33:37.499 --> 02:33:39.125
I can't leave here.

02:33:48.010 --> 02:33:51.429
Why don't we just talk about
this a bit, huh, brother?

02:34:05.444 --> 02:34:06.486
He's here on 17.

02:34:09.657 --> 02:34:11.991
Look at me. Look at me.

02:34:15.329 --> 02:34:16.496
Look at me.

02:34:48.404 --> 02:34:52.282
L.A.P.D. Don't move.
Put your hands on your head, now.

02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:29.736
Switch me to TAC 5.

02:35:29.903 --> 02:35:32.238
Casals? JJ?

02:35:33.157 --> 02:35:34.365
Drucker, JJ?

02:35:34.533 --> 02:35:37.076
I'm at the lobby level
by the stairwell.

02:35:37.244 --> 02:35:38.244
What have you got?

02:35:38.412 --> 02:35:41.581
Teams are moving up the other
elevators to the 17th floor elevators.

02:35:41.749 --> 02:35:43.916
All out of commission because of the fire alarm.

02:35:44.084 --> 02:35:47.211
- It's a mess. People everywhere.
- Fine. 10-4.

02:36:17.034 --> 02:36:18.618
Let's go, get out of the way.

02:36:18.786 --> 02:36:20.703
Stay out of the way.

02:36:28.629 --> 02:36:31.672
Let's go. Go that way.
We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

02:36:34.802 --> 02:36:36.719
I got it, sir.

02:36:38.847 --> 02:36:40.765
Come on, come on.

02:36:46.605 --> 02:36:48.231
Come on, sir.

02:36:52.486 --> 02:36:55.488
OFFICER 1: Watch your backs, ladies.
OFFICER 2: I got it, I got it.

02:36:58.158 --> 02:36:59.826
Keep moving, ma'am.

02:37:00.661 --> 02:37:01.744
Let's go.

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:05.498
Come on, let's go.

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.784
This way, ma'am.

02:37:43.745 --> 02:37:45.538
Get back, get back.

02:38:11.398 --> 02:38:13.816
- Let me have that shotgun.
- Yes, sir.

02:44:31.278 --> 02:44:34.029
Told you I'm never going back.

02:44:37.367 --> 02:44:38.993
Yeah.
