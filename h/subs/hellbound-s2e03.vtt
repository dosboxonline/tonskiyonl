WEBVTT

00:40.665 --> 00:42.333
Chairman Jung!

00:43.084 --> 00:44.044
Are you okay?

00:47.130 --> 00:48.256
Where am I?

00:50.091 --> 00:52.177
This is where I live.

00:53.762 --> 00:54.846
Don't you remember?

00:54.929 --> 00:56.723
I found you on the mountain trail…

00:57.223 --> 01:00.018
Am I really myself this time?

01:00.769 --> 01:01.644
Sir?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.828
If you need help, just tell me and I will…

01:29.881 --> 01:30.882
Sir?

01:32.675 --> 01:33.551
Chairman Jung!

01:45.438 --> 01:46.689
Sir, are you all right?

01:48.233 --> 01:50.235
Would you like some water?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.324
Please.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.744
Please stop.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.286
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

02:47.250 --> 02:48.293
Ms. Park Jungja.

02:50.211 --> 02:54.424
The world is in total chaos,
and this country is close to collapsing.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.594
Only you, Ms. Park Jungja,

02:58.553 --> 03:01.139
who came back to life
after the demonstration,

03:01.222 --> 03:03.183
can fix this chaos.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.814
Say something. Anything.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.819
All right, well…

03:15.862 --> 03:17.906
What was Hell like?

03:18.948 --> 03:22.785
It can't… be described with words.

03:24.454 --> 03:28.124
We'll be the ones to determine
if you're making sense or not,

03:28.833 --> 03:32.086
so just talk.
Aren't you tired of this? It's been years.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.927
Does it sound like
I'm asking you for a favor?

03:39.928 --> 03:41.471
I'm giving you a chance.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.933
This situation is already out of my hands.

03:45.725 --> 03:48.186
There are people out there
who will do anything

03:48.269 --> 03:52.190
to make you say what we want
if you don't talk now.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.191
Okay?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.408
- Never-ending…
- What?

04:03.952 --> 04:04.953
Despair!

04:07.288 --> 04:08.414
Despair

04:09.666 --> 04:11.459
that I may never be able

04:12.794 --> 04:14.128
to reach them.

04:16.506 --> 04:18.758
It makes me miss them even more.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.847
As if the feeling of longing and despair

04:25.723 --> 04:27.850
will go on forever.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.520
That feeling.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.605
That's what it feels like.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.234
And you live that feeling.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.489
How poetic of you.

04:54.460 --> 04:57.005
<i>All right. Let's continue.</i>

04:58.172 --> 05:00.174
You said you missed someone.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.135
Who exactly did you mean?

05:05.722 --> 05:07.015
My children.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.519
Eunyul.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.231
Hayul.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.443
Enough with Eunyul and Hayul!

05:19.360 --> 05:20.862
I would bring them here now

05:20.945 --> 05:24.032
and pull out their goddamn nails
to make you talk!

05:24.115 --> 05:26.909
Min Hyejin hid them so well
that they can't be found.

05:26.993 --> 05:29.662
I've told you a million times!

05:31.581 --> 05:32.707
Sinner Park Jungja.

05:33.291 --> 05:37.003
Your dear children are living in a world
that is about to be ruined.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.838
Have some sense of responsibility!

05:40.590 --> 05:42.550
Among the countless sinners,

05:42.633 --> 05:44.385
only you came back to life!

05:45.261 --> 05:48.890
It's your duty to deliver God's message!
Do you hear me?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.065
You know,

05:58.524 --> 06:00.735
your children must miss you

06:01.611 --> 06:04.197
as much as you miss them, right?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.285
And?

06:10.995 --> 06:13.664
It looks like
you're finally willing to talk.

06:20.671 --> 06:22.840
PARK JUNGJA, WHO FACED DEMONSTRATION
EIGHT YEARS AGO, HAS RESURRECTED!

06:22.924 --> 06:23.758
Look.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.176
FOOTAGE OF PARK'S RESURRECTION REVEALED

06:25.259 --> 06:27.762
The entire world knows
about your resurrection.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.642
Eunyul and Hayul must know
about it as well, right?

06:33.643 --> 06:35.770
So what do you think they'll do?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.566
Obviously, they'd want to see you.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.113
Min Hyejin might have hidden them well…

06:47.532 --> 06:49.700
but we don't really have to look for them

06:49.784 --> 06:52.120
because they will come to us eventually.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.330
Why?

06:57.041 --> 06:58.668
Because they miss their mom.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.546
Because she's here.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.136
I'll do it.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.762
What?

07:11.264 --> 07:12.557
I'll do anything.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.061
Please leave my children alone.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.896
Please make sure…

07:21.107 --> 07:22.066
my children…

07:24.152 --> 07:26.362
never try to come find me.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.255
From this moment on,

07:45.923 --> 07:47.425
you're not a sinner.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.635
You're the Resurrected One.

07:51.554 --> 07:55.641
The one who came back to this world
to declare the New Will of God.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.439
Okay.

08:09.155 --> 08:12.116
Kim Jeongchil, you crazy son of a bitch.

08:20.958 --> 08:23.377
EUNYUL:
WE'RE WELL. TAKE CARE, MS. MIN!

08:23.461 --> 08:25.338
THANKS, EUNYUL. KEEP ME UPDATED

08:32.970 --> 08:34.388
MS. MIN, PLEASE SAVE MY MOM

08:34.472 --> 08:35.431
I'LL THINK OF A WAY

08:37.600 --> 08:38.518
Ms. Min.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.019
Yes?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.729
The meeting is about to start.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.980
Okay.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.612
Chairman Jung, are you feeling better now?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.160
Yes, I'm okay.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.412
Would you like me to take you to a doctor?

09:01.582 --> 09:04.544
Can I get computer access?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.713
Yes, of course. One moment, please.

09:15.805 --> 09:19.267
Here. Please use it as needed.
I'm going out for a smoke.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.329
THE NEW TRUTH

09:46.502 --> 09:48.212
WHERE ARE SODO, MIN,
AND PARK'S CHILDREN?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.798
WHEREABOUTS OF MIN,
LAWYER WHO DEFENDED PARK JUNGJA, UNKNOWN

09:53.426 --> 09:55.845
KIM, THE NEW TRUTH'S 2ND CHAIRMAN!
"CHAIRMAN JUNG'S DECISION"

10:04.353 --> 10:08.149
NEWBORN CHILD RECEIVES DECREE
AND SURVIVES THE DEMONSTRATION!

10:08.816 --> 10:09.692
Yes, okay.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.616
Yes.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.328
So what do you need me to do now?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.790
He seems to be out of his mind.

10:24.874 --> 10:27.251
He screams for no reason.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.630
He's not completely himself.

10:37.803 --> 10:40.806
BREAKING NEWS
SINNER PARK JUNGJA RESURRECTED 4 YEARS AGO

10:54.445 --> 10:55.321
Yes.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.284
All right, I got it.
I'll bring him there, then.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.827
Yes.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.954
Just text me the address.

11:05.122 --> 11:05.956
Okay.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.144
SECURITY CAMERA

11:44.495 --> 11:45.371
What the hell?

12:42.011 --> 12:42.970
<i>All right.</i>

12:43.053 --> 12:45.306
<i>Everyone's here, so let's get started.</i>

12:46.432 --> 12:48.559
<i>We'll begin with the most pressing matter.</i>

12:49.685 --> 12:51.228
<i>Jung Jinsu has resurrected.</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:54.440
Is he really back?

12:55.357 --> 12:57.318
<i>We received this footage an hour ago.</i>

13:08.204 --> 13:09.622
He really is back.

13:10.706 --> 13:13.584
<i>A member living near the orphanage</i>
<i>captured him.</i>

13:14.084 --> 13:16.837
<i>He'll be moved</i>
<i>to our branch's safe house soon.</i>

13:16.921 --> 13:18.380
Safe house…

13:21.008 --> 13:23.010
What are we going to do with him?

13:23.093 --> 13:25.596
<i>Following the agreed</i>
<i>resurrection response plan,</i>

13:25.679 --> 13:27.515
<i>we should isolate him</i>

13:27.598 --> 13:30.893
<i>and investigate what happened</i>
<i>after his demonstration.</i>

13:32.186 --> 13:34.104
<i>To see if Hell actually exists.</i>

13:34.897 --> 13:35.856
For how long?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.068
The New Truth had Ms. Park Jungja
for four years,

13:39.151 --> 13:40.986
but they didn't find out anything.

13:41.070 --> 13:44.865
<i>Either way, we need to keep him</i>
<i>until we obtain some useful information.</i>

13:48.160 --> 13:51.664
Are you saying
you want to lock him up indefinitely?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.332
<i>Ms. Min.</i>

13:53.415 --> 13:56.627
<i>Legal thinking only matters</i>
<i>with a functioning legal system.</i>

13:56.710 --> 13:57.920
<i>Should we let him go?</i>

13:58.003 --> 14:00.714
<i>Or should we let everyone know</i>
<i>that Jung Jinsu is back?</i>

14:01.298 --> 14:03.592
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>what kind of chaos it may bring</i>

14:03.676 --> 14:06.428
<i>or how the Arrowhead</i>
<i>or the New Truth might abuse it.</i>

14:06.512 --> 14:09.723
<i>The resurrection response plan</i>
<i>was approved in the last meeting.</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:11.058
<i>Should we reevaluate?</i>

14:11.141 --> 14:13.686
No, I'll follow your decision.

14:13.769 --> 14:17.022
Instead, I'd like to discuss
the rescue plan for Ms. Park

14:17.106 --> 14:19.483
that I previously proposed.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.819
<i>With the upcoming announcement</i>
<i>of the New Will,</i>

14:21.902 --> 14:24.613
<i>the New Truth's security</i>
<i>is as tight as the Blue House.</i>

14:25.281 --> 14:27.575
<i>It's absolutely impossible</i>
<i>with our resources.</i>

14:27.658 --> 14:29.493
But if their announcement is successful,

14:29.577 --> 14:32.997
the New Truth's doctrine
will become the country's new system,

14:33.080 --> 14:34.957
turning Korea into a theocracy.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.711
<i>That may be better than the Arrowhead</i>
<i>taking over the country.</i>

14:39.211 --> 14:41.255
<i>They're having their own power struggle.</i>

14:41.338 --> 14:43.424
<i>Why meddle in that?</i>

14:45.050 --> 14:48.345
<i>What exactly are you planning to do</i>
<i>after rescuing Ms. Park Jungja?</i>

14:48.429 --> 14:49.638
What do you mean?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.474
Take her to her family, of course.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.269
<i>Don't you care</i>
<i>about the damage that might cause us?</i>

14:55.352 --> 14:59.189
<i>He's right. It's way too risky</i>
<i>when we're uncertain about the benefit.</i>

14:59.273 --> 15:00.774
Hard to understand?

15:00.858 --> 15:05.613
Does reuniting a mother with her children
really require any explanation?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.114
"Risky"?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.366
Name one thing we've done
that wasn't risky.

15:09.450 --> 15:13.329
We used to sacrifice several members
just to save one recipient of a decree.

15:13.412 --> 15:17.374
When did we become a political group
that acts solely based on gain or loss?

15:17.458 --> 15:22.880
<i>So you want to put us all in danger</i>
<i>for some kids we've never seen?</i>

15:23.380 --> 15:25.883
<i>Where the hell are Park's kids anyway?</i>

15:27.468 --> 15:30.179
I'm Ms. Park Jungja's attorney.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.015
Back then, I promised her

15:33.098 --> 15:36.018
I'd keep her children safe
somewhere no one knew them.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.563
Revealing their whereabouts
would be unethical.

15:41.190 --> 15:42.441
<i>So now you're a lawyer?</i>

15:43.400 --> 15:44.360
<i>Ms. Min,</i>

15:44.443 --> 15:48.739
<i>do you want to use us as pawns</i>
<i>while keeping crucial details to yourself?</i>

15:48.822 --> 15:51.659
<i>You took the baby</i>
<i>who survived the demonstration,</i>

15:51.742 --> 15:54.620
<i>and you refuse to share information</i>
<i>about Park's family!</i>

15:54.703 --> 15:56.830
<i>Do you think</i>
<i>Sodo is your private organization?</i>

15:56.914 --> 15:59.583
I'm not trying to keep anything to myself!

15:59.667 --> 16:03.045
Those people are not objects
you can own to gain power!

16:06.048 --> 16:09.176
If you refuse to do it,
I'm going to do it on my own.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.427
<i>Come on, everyone!</i>

16:12.346 --> 16:13.806
<i>Let's all calm down.</i>

16:15.015 --> 16:17.893
<i>Ms. Min is right</i>
<i>about things getting out of hand</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:19.687
<i>once the New Will is announced.</i>

16:19.770 --> 16:22.690
<i>Since you're so determined,</i>
<i>we'll discuss it further.</i>

16:23.273 --> 16:24.108
Fine.

16:24.733 --> 16:28.028
Whatever you decide,
please do it as soon as possible.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.363
We don't have much time.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.783
<i>All branch leaders except Ms. Min,</i>
<i>we'll resume after a ten-minute break.</i>

16:32.866 --> 16:34.743
<i>Please access the link I've sent.</i>

17:33.761 --> 17:35.846
Are you awake, Chairman Jung Jinsu?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.475
Who are you?

17:41.518 --> 17:42.770
Where are we going?

17:43.937 --> 17:46.106
You'll be under Sodo's watch from now on.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.902
- Sodo?
- Yes.

17:50.402 --> 17:52.988
I didn't cover your mouth

17:54.364 --> 17:57.659
because I won't get a chance
to talk to you once I hand you over.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.078
So how do you feel?

18:01.789 --> 18:02.831
About what?

18:05.000 --> 18:08.253
I'm sure you saw on the Internet
how crazy the world is now.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.755
I was curious

18:11.590 --> 18:13.342
how you would feel,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.095
seeing that the world you created
has become such a mess.

18:18.472 --> 18:19.306
So?

18:21.475 --> 18:23.477
Is this the kind of world you wanted?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.439
Did you get
the kind of justice you wanted?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.651
What do you want from me?

18:35.072 --> 18:37.032
Do you want to take revenge on me?

18:38.450 --> 18:39.368
Revenge?

18:42.079 --> 18:43.831
How should I take my revenge?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.291
Should I kill you?

18:50.212 --> 18:53.799
Death wouldn't mean much to you
since you've already experienced it.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.427
I just wanted to let you know
what you have done.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.389
I don't understand what you're saying.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.517
Why don't you break it down for me?

19:08.856 --> 19:09.773
My wife…

19:12.359 --> 19:15.404
was destroyed
by the idea you put inside her head.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
<i>We have breaking news.</i>

19:20.075 --> 19:22.411
<i>Reports have emerged this afternoon</i>
<i>of strange creatures</i>

19:22.494 --> 19:24.955
<i>seen near Hapseong Station</i>
<i>in the heart of Seoul.</i>

19:25.038 --> 19:30.377
<i>Shocking eyewitness footage</i>
<i>filmed at the scene has emerged.</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:35.382
<i>The videos are quickly spreading online</i>
<i>and across social media.</i>

19:35.465 --> 19:36.842
Jiwon.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.886
I'm home.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.263
<i>…brutally kill a fleeing man</i>

19:41.346 --> 19:43.473
<i>and disappear into thin air,</i>

19:43.557 --> 19:45.100
<i>leaving viewers in shock.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:47.060
Jiwon, what are you doing?

19:47.144 --> 19:47.978
Hey.

19:48.770 --> 19:49.730
You're back.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.815
- Have you eaten?
- I have.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.779
What's so interesting
that you can't take your eyes off the TV?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.616
Something strange must have happened.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.035
What is that?

20:04.077 --> 20:05.621
<i>Meanwhile, some speculate</i>

20:05.704 --> 20:09.833
<i>that this incident was related</i>
<i>to a religious group called the New Truth.</i>

20:09.917 --> 20:14.630
<i>Online, trending searches</i>
<i>are currently dominated by "The New Truth"</i>

20:14.713 --> 20:16.798
<i>and the name of its chairman,</i>
<i>"Jung Jinsu."</i>

20:47.037 --> 20:47.913
Jiwon.

21:08.392 --> 21:10.644
<i>Those saying humans</i>
<i>are above everything else…</i>

21:16.275 --> 21:17.109
Jiwon!

21:18.110 --> 21:20.445
Why are you still up?
You have work tomorrow.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.947
I'll sleep in a bit.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.412
<i>The concept of sin exists</i>
<i>because humans choose to sin.</i>

21:39.631 --> 21:41.550
I'm sorry.

21:41.633 --> 21:43.719
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

22:02.571 --> 22:03.613
Ten.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.157
Nine.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.034
Eight.

22:07.784 --> 22:08.618
Seven.

22:09.161 --> 22:09.995
Six.

22:10.746 --> 22:11.580
Five.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.248
Four.

22:14.041 --> 22:14.958
Three.

22:15.500 --> 22:16.418
Two.

22:17.210 --> 22:18.045
One.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.644
Jiwon, let's go now, okay?

22:36.938 --> 22:37.773
Jiwon.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.258
Jiwon, don't go any closer. Jiwon!

23:08.887 --> 23:10.013
Let's go, okay?

23:19.231 --> 23:21.108
Jiwon!

24:12.534 --> 24:13.994
Jiwon.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.136
Jiwon, this is dangerous.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.638
What's all this? You could hurt yourself.

24:34.973 --> 24:35.891
Dear me.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.273
What are you doing, darling?

24:46.776 --> 24:49.696
The New Truth's next chairman
has been chosen.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.241
Oh, really? Is it on the news?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.242
No.

24:55.243 --> 24:56.328
On the Internet.

24:59.039 --> 25:02.792
They say an official announcement
will be made in three days.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.511
Why don't we go for a drive?

25:13.094 --> 25:14.346
Where is

25:15.180 --> 25:16.598
Chairman Jung Jinsu?

25:18.391 --> 25:20.977
You said you wanted to go the other day.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.395
Let's go!

25:22.896 --> 25:23.897
Okay?

25:34.324 --> 25:38.203
Jiwon, remember the client
I told you about? The building owner.

25:38.787 --> 25:41.623
He already confirmed everything,
but now he wants to back out.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.458
What does he expect me to do?

25:44.167 --> 25:46.127
He deserves a demonstration, doesn't he?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.050
Sehyeong, don't say that.

25:52.133 --> 25:53.093
What?

25:56.012 --> 25:57.097
Oh, right.

25:57.681 --> 25:58.807
Yeah, I'm sorry.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.852
Winning the lottery is more likely
than facing a demonstration,

26:02.936 --> 26:04.229
so I was only joking.

26:04.312 --> 26:06.106
Don't talk about it like that!

26:06.856 --> 26:10.777
Even if it happens to just one person,
it's like it's happening to all of us.

26:10.860 --> 26:14.489
Mentioning demonstrations
with indifference is blasphemous.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.491
Sorry, Jiwon. Please just calm down.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.659
No!

26:18.159 --> 26:20.412
It's not me you should be apologizing to!

26:23.873 --> 26:25.250
Please.

26:26.793 --> 26:29.004
Please!

26:29.087 --> 26:30.297
All right. Sorry, Jiwon.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.965
Calm down. I'm sorry.

26:39.723 --> 26:42.017
I'm sorry, Jiwon. Honey.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.778
We've got to finish the tiling
by next week.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.904
I'll do my best.

26:54.988 --> 26:57.949
We have no choice.
We need to install the drywall this week.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.581
<i>They must have thought</i>
<i>they could break our faith with this,</i>

27:04.664 --> 27:05.665
<i>but not even close!</i>

27:06.249 --> 27:09.252
<i>This baby's demonstration</i>
<i>has further proven</i>

27:09.336 --> 27:13.256
<i>that our beliefs and the path</i>
<i>that we have pursued are correct.</i>

27:13.757 --> 27:15.842
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Let me, Pinwheel, tell you this.</i>

27:15.925 --> 27:18.470
<i>This was God's merciful intervention</i>

27:18.553 --> 27:21.389
<i>to punish the child's mother and father</i>
<i>for their sins.</i>

27:22.098 --> 27:23.892
<i>Through this couple,</i>

27:23.975 --> 27:29.939
<i>God clearly showed us how we should repent</i>
<i>and seek atonement for our sins!</i>

27:31.191 --> 27:33.234
<i>We must answer God's calling.</i>

27:33.943 --> 27:36.863
<i>We must devote ourselves</i>
<i>to the opportunities God gives us!</i>

27:37.530 --> 27:40.825
<i>The Arrowhead!</i>

27:44.287 --> 27:46.081
All right. Thank you.

27:47.832 --> 27:48.875
Hello?

27:48.958 --> 27:52.420
<i>Ms. Oh hasn't come to work today.</i>

27:52.504 --> 27:55.256
Really? But I saw her
leaving the house this morning.

27:55.757 --> 27:56.591
I see.

27:58.718 --> 28:02.639
Is everything okay with Ms. Oh?

28:03.640 --> 28:05.600
She's been looking a little down,

28:06.935 --> 28:10.563
and she's been taking
a lot of days off lately.

28:11.398 --> 28:14.484
I see. Let me talk to her
and get back to you.

28:14.567 --> 28:15.860
<i>All right, then.</i>

28:15.944 --> 28:16.820
Bye.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.122
Jiwon.

28:38.758 --> 28:39.592
Jiwon.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.512
Oh Jiwon--

28:57.986 --> 29:00.905
We, the Arrowhead,
must surrender to God's will

29:00.989 --> 29:04.743
and engage as actively as we can
in God's intervention!

29:05.285 --> 29:08.955
We're the only ones
who can spread the true will of God!

29:11.166 --> 29:15.754
The Arrowhead!

30:12.519 --> 30:13.645
Jiwon.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.605
Let's go home.

30:16.689 --> 30:18.107
Let's talk at home, okay?

30:19.192 --> 30:20.276
I can't.

30:20.360 --> 30:23.196
Our members will soon bring in a sinner.

30:23.279 --> 30:26.032
So what if they do?
What are you going to do?

30:27.867 --> 30:29.702
I'm going to join the demonstration.

30:31.454 --> 30:34.791
I'm going to confess all my sins to God.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.085
What are you saying?

30:38.753 --> 30:40.839
Are you planning to kill yourself
or something?

30:41.339 --> 30:42.382
Kill myself?

30:42.465 --> 30:43.967
How dare you!

30:44.551 --> 30:46.344
This isn't like that kind of sin!

30:46.970 --> 30:51.015
I'm revealing all my sins before God
and asking for His forgiveness!

30:52.976 --> 30:54.102
What sins?

30:56.271 --> 30:59.524
You wouldn't hurt a fly,
so what sins could you have committed?

31:00.149 --> 31:01.651
The sin of negligence!

31:01.734 --> 31:04.487
The sin of neglecting this world
that refused to change

31:04.571 --> 31:07.699
when God gave us an opportunity
by showing us the way!

31:09.993 --> 31:10.827
Jiwon.

31:12.495 --> 31:13.496
Please stop.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.333
Please, okay?

31:18.877 --> 31:19.919
Please!

31:21.296 --> 31:22.130
I am

31:23.214 --> 31:24.716
no longer Oh Jiwon.

31:26.009 --> 31:31.347
I'm Miss Sunshine of the Arrowhead,
devoted to following God's will.

31:33.766 --> 31:36.603
Chairman Jung Jinsu called this
a demonstration, no less.

31:37.103 --> 31:40.189
He said God was showing us
what will happen to us when we die.

31:41.065 --> 31:44.819
He also said
that we will all face it eventually

31:45.361 --> 31:47.739
if we're not forgiven while we're alive.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.657
Jiwon, please!

31:50.617 --> 31:53.077
Please come to your senses, okay?

31:53.953 --> 31:55.204
Come to your senses…

31:57.206 --> 32:00.126
so we can go back to our ordinary life.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.921
I beg you. Please.

32:03.004 --> 32:03.880
"Ordinary"?

32:04.589 --> 32:06.424
What I'm trying to do now…

32:08.426 --> 32:10.887
is put an end to that ordinary world.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.057
Don't you get it?

32:14.140 --> 32:16.935
Everything that we thought was ordinary

32:17.852 --> 32:19.520
was the evil of the world.

32:23.274 --> 32:24.400
You're the one

32:25.026 --> 32:26.694
who needs to come to your senses.

32:32.075 --> 32:32.951
What's that?

32:33.993 --> 32:36.037
- The sinner must be here.
- Jiwon!

32:42.835 --> 32:43.878
What's going on?

32:43.962 --> 32:46.547
The sinner is here.
His demonstration will begin soon.

32:47.090 --> 32:47.924
What?

32:57.058 --> 32:58.476
Here's the sinner!

32:59.310 --> 33:02.855
Three minutes!
Just hold out for three minutes!

33:44.897 --> 33:46.649
Get him! Come on!

33:50.570 --> 33:51.404
Stay still!

34:01.289 --> 34:02.206
Untie this now!

34:02.290 --> 34:04.542
Bring him over here! Over here!

34:05.793 --> 34:07.045
Over there!

34:07.128 --> 34:08.713
Go! Hurry!

34:17.722 --> 34:19.682
Hey! Give me a hand here!

34:20.516 --> 34:21.601
- Quickly!
- Come on!

34:21.684 --> 34:22.518
Hurry!

34:23.686 --> 34:24.562
Come on, push!

34:27.023 --> 34:28.191
Pull him! Quickly!

34:32.195 --> 34:34.030
Here! Put him on this!

34:34.614 --> 34:35.490
Hurry!

34:38.868 --> 34:39.702
Hurry!

34:42.205 --> 34:43.039
Go!

34:44.165 --> 34:45.333
Keep pushing!

34:45.416 --> 34:46.709
- Come on, push!
- Push!

34:46.793 --> 34:47.877
Now!

34:55.885 --> 34:57.595
Get down!

34:58.888 --> 35:00.932
Push!

35:11.234 --> 35:14.028
Everyone, pile on him!

35:14.112 --> 35:15.863
Join the demonstration!

35:15.947 --> 35:18.032
Let's save ourselves from our sins!

35:18.116 --> 35:20.868
- To the path to atonement!
- I ask for your forgiveness!

35:24.789 --> 35:26.541
I'm coming too!

35:28.709 --> 35:30.086
Jiwon, no! Don't!

35:31.003 --> 35:33.089
- Jiwon!
- No, let me go!

35:33.172 --> 35:34.465
I have to join them!

35:35.049 --> 35:36.467
I have to join them!

35:43.224 --> 35:44.851
I have to join them!

35:44.934 --> 35:46.894
Please stop, Jiwon. Let's go!

35:46.978 --> 35:47.812
Let go of me!

36:03.327 --> 36:04.579
Jiwon!

36:31.981 --> 36:33.774
I am forgiven.

36:41.407 --> 36:42.491
God

36:43.367 --> 36:46.621
has forgiven my sins!

36:57.215 --> 37:01.510
I have been forgiven!

37:02.136 --> 37:08.601
The Arrowhead!

37:19.862 --> 37:20.780
Jiwon.

37:29.038 --> 37:31.791
The purgation is not only for the sinners!

37:32.416 --> 37:35.086
The flames of purgation
burn off all of our sins!

37:35.169 --> 37:37.213
MY LOVE, HOPE WE CAN HAVE DINNER
TOGETHER TONIGHT

37:37.296 --> 37:41.133
We must all submit ourselves
to God's retribution!

37:42.426 --> 37:45.846
This first divine appearance in millennia
signifies God's intervention…

37:45.930 --> 37:47.765
I'LL BE A LITTLE LATE TONIGHT!
DON'T SKIP DINNER

37:47.848 --> 37:53.354
…urging us to admit our sins openly
and seek repentance.

37:53.437 --> 37:56.732
It is humanity's final opportunity!

37:57.525 --> 38:01.070
The Arrowhead!

38:07.410 --> 38:08.869
- We'll finish with paint.
- Yes.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.080
Should we use the color you suggested?

38:11.163 --> 38:12.540
Yes. Please be on time.

38:12.623 --> 38:13.874
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

38:26.470 --> 38:30.224
HONEY, I'M AFRAID I HAVE SINNED AGAIN
I MUST SEEK FORGIVENESS ONCE MORE

38:36.605 --> 38:39.984
The Arrowhead!

39:41.670 --> 39:43.798
Why?!

39:49.220 --> 39:50.179
Why?!

39:57.770 --> 39:58.604
Why?

40:00.815 --> 40:01.690
Why?!

40:04.110 --> 40:06.821
Why did you associate
those monsters with sin?

40:08.656 --> 40:10.116
You knew it wasn't true!

40:13.119 --> 40:14.328
You made it so that…

40:16.997 --> 40:18.999
even if someone joins the demonstration…

40:22.211 --> 40:23.337
and survives…

40:25.339 --> 40:28.342
they can never escape their sins
as long as they are alive.

40:30.886 --> 40:32.638
For your wife…

40:34.807 --> 40:36.308
that was a pleasure.

40:37.726 --> 40:38.561
What?

40:38.644 --> 40:41.397
That feeling
of following God's will together.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.024
That wholeness.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.610
That sense of solidarity.

40:48.195 --> 40:49.989
And the peace that brings.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.325
All of that

40:54.994 --> 40:58.497
gave her pleasure unlike any
she had ever known in her ordinary life.

41:00.875 --> 41:04.170
She would've felt immense pleasure
when she joined the demonstration.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.715
It's a pleasure…

41:14.638 --> 41:17.016
she never felt in her marriage with you.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.418
You goddamn bastard.

41:46.128 --> 41:49.256
Don't you feel any guilt
over what has become of the world?

42:05.356 --> 42:07.983
I've been through demonstrations
over and over again,

42:09.735 --> 42:11.862
and you're using
human violence against me.

42:12.905 --> 42:13.781
How touching.

42:16.242 --> 42:19.578
So did you decide
to seek revenge for your wife

42:20.621 --> 42:22.248
by handing me over to Sodo?

42:23.832 --> 42:25.334
It's not about revenge.

42:26.794 --> 42:27.670
We are…

42:29.838 --> 42:34.301
We are trying to create a world
without more victims like my wife!

42:47.690 --> 42:49.191
Is that what Sodo told you?

42:50.442 --> 42:51.277
What?

42:51.360 --> 42:53.904
Is that how they convinced you
to join them?

43:01.120 --> 43:02.121
Listen carefully.

43:04.915 --> 43:09.253
I know you miss the past,
but you can't go back now.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.672
The world has changed.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.384
The new world needs a new kind of justice.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.761
Those fools lack the desire
and ability to do it.

43:19.054 --> 43:20.431
Cut the crap, you bastard.

43:21.473 --> 43:24.727
You think you know the world
from a quick glance on the Internet?

43:24.810 --> 43:27.354
What has Sodo done
with the baby who survived?

43:27.438 --> 43:29.148
It's already been four years.

43:30.107 --> 43:33.068
If they wanted a change,
they wouldn't just sit back and watch.

43:33.652 --> 43:34.945
They said…

43:36.989 --> 43:38.532
they were studying the baby.

43:39.867 --> 43:41.201
To find out the truth.

43:41.910 --> 43:42.828
The truth?

43:45.164 --> 43:46.248
The truth?

43:48.250 --> 43:51.295
I'm the one
who saw the truth with my own eyes.

43:53.297 --> 43:54.590
But what if the truth

43:55.966 --> 43:57.509
isn't the one they wanted?

43:58.844 --> 44:00.679
Would they really accept it?

44:01.805 --> 44:06.393
They are merely drunk on the belief
that they're defending justice.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.481
What will they do once you hand me over?

44:13.025 --> 44:13.859
Investigate you.

44:13.942 --> 44:15.569
They'll kill me.

44:17.446 --> 44:21.575
Because the truth I know
is useless to them,

44:22.076 --> 44:26.038
and my existence
is the biggest threat to them.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.333
Cut the bullshit!

44:31.251 --> 44:34.213
I bet that baby is already dead too.

44:34.296 --> 44:35.130
No.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.383
The baby…

44:39.385 --> 44:40.886
is under Sodo's protection.

44:44.264 --> 44:45.224
Have you

44:46.308 --> 44:48.769
actually seen for yourself
how the baby is doing?

44:49.395 --> 44:50.479
Or heard anything?

44:50.562 --> 44:53.691
They'd probably only say
that they have the child.

44:54.983 --> 44:56.402
Sodo likely approached

44:57.111 --> 45:00.572
the families of the Arrowhead members
who had joined the demonstration

45:00.656 --> 45:03.117
to convince them
to side with them for justice.

45:06.161 --> 45:07.121
You

45:08.914 --> 45:11.625
have been used by Sodo,

45:11.709 --> 45:15.421
just like your wife was used
by the Arrowhead.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.925
No.

45:20.926 --> 45:24.388
You said you wanted to create a world
without more victims like your wife.

45:26.932 --> 45:28.559
The only person who can do that…

45:30.561 --> 45:31.562
is me.

45:33.355 --> 45:34.440
And you know that.

45:48.537 --> 45:49.663
Perhaps…

45:52.249 --> 45:54.042
this is the last chance

45:55.252 --> 45:56.712
to fix this world.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.457
When will they arrive?

46:34.166 --> 46:35.209
Any minute now.

46:42.007 --> 46:43.008
Hey.

47:12.704 --> 47:14.122
It really is Jung Jinsu.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.045
- Move him to our car.
- Okay.

47:20.838 --> 47:21.672
Come on out.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.257
Yes, we've got him.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.052
Yes. All right, got it.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.764
Yes, it's definitely him.

47:37.354 --> 47:38.856
Yes, understood. Okay.

47:43.777 --> 47:44.653
Good job.

47:44.736 --> 47:45.654
Sure.

47:46.613 --> 47:48.699
What are you planning to do now?

47:49.908 --> 47:50.951
With Jung Jinsu.

47:51.994 --> 47:55.330
We'll probably take him
to a safe place to study him.

47:55.998 --> 47:56.915
"Study him"?

47:56.999 --> 47:58.208
- Yes.
- Right.

47:58.750 --> 48:00.669
How long will you study him for?

48:01.920 --> 48:02.838
I'm not sure.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.841
Until we find out the truth?

48:06.842 --> 48:08.010
I'm not too sure.

48:08.093 --> 48:11.179
And what if the truth was something
that worked against Sodo?

48:12.264 --> 48:14.057
I don't think that's for me to answer.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.895
You should go home for now.
We'll be in touch.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.771
Thank you.

48:19.855 --> 48:20.689
- Let's go.
- Okay.

48:22.399 --> 48:23.317
Will you kill him?

48:28.989 --> 48:29.907
I'm sorry?

48:31.366 --> 48:32.326
Jung Jinsu.

48:33.619 --> 48:34.536
Will you kill him?

48:36.955 --> 48:37.998
Kill him?

48:38.624 --> 48:39.541
That's absurd.

48:40.876 --> 48:42.044
Anyway, thank you.

49:33.470 --> 49:36.306
You said you wanted to create a world
without more victims like your wife.

50:19.141 --> 50:20.225
<i>Perhaps</i>

50:21.309 --> 50:22.686
this is the last chance

50:23.520 --> 50:25.522
<i>to fix this world.</i>

50:45.250 --> 50:47.169
Don't they let people sleep in Hell?

50:49.379 --> 50:52.799
You're back after eight years,
and you're sleeping? Really?

52:32.023 --> 52:35.235
Jung Jinsu.
This is that last chance you talked about.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.445
What do we do now?

52:38.572 --> 52:40.490
Your wife was well-known in the Arrowhead.

52:41.825 --> 52:42.659
And?

52:43.743 --> 52:45.370
Take me to the Arrowhead's leader.

52:46.454 --> 52:47.706
Why the Arrowhead?

52:50.125 --> 52:52.294
The only group
that can change the world now

52:53.545 --> 52:54.504
is the Arrowhead.

52:57.340 --> 52:58.800
And get rid of your phone.

52:59.801 --> 53:01.344
Sodo will be tracking it.

55:36.708 --> 55:40.712
