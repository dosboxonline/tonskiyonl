00:23.356 --> 00:25.442
YULHYE ANGELS HAVEN

00:53.595 --> 00:54.846
Heejung.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.529
Jung Jinsu!

01:13.323 --> 01:14.741
Don't move, you bastard.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.162
Where is Heejung?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.457
I will tell you where she is

01:23.041 --> 01:25.335
after you listen to my story.

01:28.505 --> 01:29.881
Twenty years ago…

01:31.966 --> 01:33.218
I received a prophecy.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.554
<i>"Jung Jinsu."</i>

01:40.058 --> 01:42.560
"Twenty years from now, at 10:30 p.m…

01:46.189 --> 01:47.398
you are bound for Hell."

01:57.492 --> 01:58.952
The prophecy will be fulfilled…

02:01.246 --> 02:02.539
ten minutes from now.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.292
Why did you use my daughter?

02:06.793 --> 02:08.795
What do you think my sin is?

02:08.878 --> 02:12.423
Why did you get my daughter involved?

02:12.507 --> 02:14.467
Please, Detective.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.638
Please. Just listen to me.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.141
Your sin?

02:22.475 --> 02:23.393
Probably none.

02:23.476 --> 02:26.646
Or maybe something
as petty as stealing a pencil or two.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.564
Why?

02:29.232 --> 02:33.027
How can I not have sinned
when I am bound for Hell?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.572
You didn't grill Park Jungja
about her sins.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.784
You would have if you were sure
that only sinners were bound for Hell!

02:43.538 --> 02:45.206
No wonder you're a detective.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.338
But you know…

02:55.466 --> 02:56.634
I have never…

02:58.636 --> 03:01.806
stolen anything in my life.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.725
<i>I have never lied</i>

03:05.185 --> 03:06.936
<i>or hurt anyone's feelings.</i>

03:08.771 --> 03:10.356
<i>I've never done anything wrong.</i>

03:12.442 --> 03:13.610
<i>I believed</i>…

03:16.946 --> 03:18.865
that my mother would come back for me…

03:20.867 --> 03:22.785
if I behaved myself.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.627
I thought God had made a mistake.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.794
Think about it.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.797
God wouldn't punish humans at random.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.010
<i>But it turns out He does.</i>

03:40.720 --> 03:43.097
I have been living every moment in fear…

03:45.725 --> 03:48.311
ever since I received the decree.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.188
For 20 years.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.899
For 20 long years.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.653
<i>Isn't that too long?</i>

03:57.904 --> 03:59.155
"Would this be a sin?"

03:59.697 --> 04:00.823
"Would that be a sin?"

04:01.324 --> 04:04.035
You cannot afford to be complacent,
even a second.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.996
People don't understand
how privileged they are

04:07.080 --> 04:09.249
to be complacent and oblivious!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.503
I was saving people
while trembling in fear,

04:14.337 --> 04:16.047
but they didn't even realize

04:16.130 --> 04:19.175
how much of a privilege it was
to stand and do nothing,

04:19.676 --> 04:21.469
even though they were all sinners.

04:22.637 --> 04:24.389
People need to feel the fear.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.141
The fear of sin.

04:27.892 --> 04:30.228
The fear of possibly committing a sin.

04:30.311 --> 04:32.814
The fear of ignoring the sins of others.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.858
The fear that is relentless.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.654
The fear of eternal pain.

04:42.657 --> 04:43.741
That fear

04:45.368 --> 04:46.953
will save mankind.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.290
And it will…

04:52.292 --> 04:53.835
set us all free from sin.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.841
Your daughter

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
should be waiting for you at home.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.764
I will give you free will, Detective.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.934
You have two options.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.230
Those creatures will come…

05:16.649 --> 05:18.067
and kill me now.

05:19.652 --> 05:24.198
Filming it and showing it to the world
will spark chaos among people.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.287
Then you can go home…

05:33.416 --> 05:36.794
and arrest your own daughter
for murdering your enemy.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.713
If you do that…

05:41.090 --> 05:44.344
you might be able to keep
your ideal world for a little longer.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.097
If that's not what you want…

05:50.767 --> 05:52.685
just keep quiet about my death…

05:54.937 --> 05:56.898
and you can freely enjoy…

05:59.692 --> 06:01.069
this new world I created

06:02.570 --> 06:04.072
with Heejung.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.122
They are here.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.754
I'll leave the world in your hands.

06:22.131 --> 06:24.133
If you choose to keep quiet…

06:28.805 --> 06:30.640
please take care of my remains.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.507
Enough.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.868
You scared me.

07:34.912 --> 07:36.497
What's wrong?

07:37.957 --> 07:38.875
Who are you?

07:39.375 --> 07:40.334
What?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.630
Did you have a bad dream?

07:50.094 --> 07:51.304
It's okay.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.098
It's okay.

07:54.182 --> 07:56.309
You're awake now.

07:58.394 --> 07:59.937
Tomorrow is the day.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.440
Come pick me up at two o'clock.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.108
And then

08:05.359 --> 08:07.236
we'll start a new life.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.114
Just the two of us.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.201
Just you and me.

08:14.452 --> 08:16.287
No one else.

08:17.747 --> 08:18.748
A fresh start.

08:25.254 --> 08:26.255
Go back to sleep.

08:27.757 --> 08:28.591
Okay?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.695
- Ducks?
- Quack, quack.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.364
- Sparrows?
- Tweet, tweet.

08:51.447 --> 08:53.574
- Pigs?
- Oink, oink.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.660
- Honeybees?
- Buzz, buzz.

08:55.743 --> 08:57.495
- Ducks?
- Quack, quack.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.288
- Sparrows?
- Tweet, tweet.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.248
Pigs?

09:46.627 --> 09:49.964
I told you to wait in the car.
We have to leave before Jinsu sees us.

09:50.047 --> 09:50.881
That's me.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.593
And you

09:54.802 --> 09:55.803
are my mom.

09:57.221 --> 09:58.097
What do you mean?

09:58.180 --> 09:59.307
You're my mom!

09:59.390 --> 10:01.892
What are you saying?
We have to go before Jinsu sees us!

10:33.049 --> 10:33.883
What now?

10:42.850 --> 10:43.934
How could you?

10:46.812 --> 10:48.230
You said you'd be back soon.

10:48.898 --> 10:49.732
I see.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.610
It was because of a guy.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.614
What are you talking about?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.324
What's your damn problem?

10:58.407 --> 11:00.159
Why did you abandon me?

11:02.703 --> 11:03.829
Let go!

11:04.330 --> 11:06.207
Let go of me, you fucking asshole!

11:06.290 --> 11:09.168
Go ahead! Kill your wife and kid!

11:09.251 --> 11:10.503
Just kill everybody!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.101
Dad, please stop!

11:29.980 --> 11:32.024
Get back inside, Jinsu!

11:34.276 --> 11:35.361
Jung Jinsu!

11:39.448 --> 11:40.449
Jinsu!

11:41.075 --> 11:42.284
Go back to your room!

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
I told you to stay in your room!

13:00.112 --> 13:02.114
No.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.116
Stop.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.882
Please stop.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.968
Where am I?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.306
Who am I this time?

16:05.339 --> 16:06.256
Excuse me.

16:08.342 --> 16:09.426
Are you all right?

16:10.427 --> 16:11.428
Excuse me.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.482
Jung…

16:25.192 --> 16:26.068
Jung Jin…

16:26.652 --> 16:28.195
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

16:31.991 --> 16:32.908
Chairman Jung!

16:44.128 --> 16:44.962
Jung…

16:45.629 --> 16:46.672
Jung Jinsu.

17:11.280 --> 17:14.283
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

17:17.119 --> 17:18.996
Join the demonstration!

17:19.079 --> 17:21.123
Judgment day is here!

17:45.314 --> 17:46.482
THE ARROWHEAD SHOWS GOD'S MERCY

17:52.696 --> 17:56.658
Demonstration is the only redemption.
The Arrowhead is God's only apostle.

18:12.132 --> 18:13.967
Greetings, everyone.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.971
I'm Miss Sunshine.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.061
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok here

18:24.645 --> 18:26.980
received a decree one month ago.

18:27.564 --> 18:28.774
Isn't that right?

18:28.857 --> 18:30.067
Yes, that's right.

18:30.567 --> 18:34.071
And in 20 minutes,
he will receive his demonstration.

18:35.781 --> 18:36.990
Yes, you are correct.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.078
Why are you going to Hell?

18:41.161 --> 18:44.706
What could your sin be?

18:44.790 --> 18:45.999
- Spill it!
- Well…

18:47.126 --> 18:49.044
Back when I was a student…

18:51.630 --> 18:53.966
I was a bully at school!

18:55.676 --> 18:57.970
Did you know that the kid you bullied

18:58.053 --> 19:00.347
is still suffering from the trauma

19:01.098 --> 19:03.475
and living a tormented life?

19:03.559 --> 19:06.478
I had no idea. I really didn't know!

19:06.562 --> 19:08.564
You ruined someone else's life,

19:09.273 --> 19:11.900
and then went on
to live a happy and successful one

19:11.984 --> 19:13.735
supported by your parents.

19:14.403 --> 19:19.741
Have you ever considered
how that would make the victim feel?

19:19.825 --> 19:20.909
No, I haven't.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.123
You truly are a scumbag.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.458
Mr. Jung.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.629
You scumbag!

19:44.349 --> 19:45.684
Stand by.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.187
One, two, action.

19:49.229 --> 19:50.063
All right!

19:50.814 --> 19:52.774
Hello, fellow members of the Arrowhead!

19:53.483 --> 19:54.401
This is Pinwheel.

19:55.319 --> 19:58.238
Cultural critic Kim Seokcheong
is joining us today

19:58.739 --> 20:03.076
on our broadcast
of Sinner Jung Gyeongseok's demonstration.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
The Arrowhead!

20:06.205 --> 20:07.039
The Arrowhead.

20:08.498 --> 20:09.333
Now.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.001
What do you think?

20:11.668 --> 20:14.588
Do you believe Mr. Jung's sin

20:14.671 --> 20:19.801
is something that can be forgiven by God
through our efforts?

20:19.885 --> 20:20.719
You see,

20:20.802 --> 20:24.014
school violence is a serious issue.

20:24.806 --> 20:26.642
What makes it so serious

20:26.725 --> 20:30.145
is that it leaves victims
with severe childhood trauma.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.064
It can be quite serious.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.441
Do you mean he's unlikely to be forgiven?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.902
Exactly. It wouldn't be easy.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.612
<i>However,</i>

20:40.322 --> 20:45.953
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok came to us
to inform us of his decree.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.705
Not the New Truth,

20:48.789 --> 20:51.875
who exploit God's divine intervention
for their own gain.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.877
He came to us, the Arrowhead,

20:53.961 --> 20:57.047
who would do anything
to uphold God's will.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.090
That's right!

20:58.674 --> 20:59.800
- Yes!
- That's right!

21:00.384 --> 21:03.178
You did the right thing,
Sinner Jung Gyeongseok.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.099
Facing your demonstration
with the New Truth

21:07.182 --> 21:09.142
would be an insult to God's name.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.187
By choosing us, the Arrowhead,

21:12.688 --> 21:15.232
you have earned
a chance to redeem yourself.

21:16.817 --> 21:20.737
The Arrowhead!

21:26.368 --> 21:31.081
God sent a decree to an innocent baby

21:31.164 --> 21:34.584
to punish its mother and father
for their sins.

21:34.668 --> 21:40.173
Bae Youngjae and Song Sohyun
always mocked and distrusted God's will.

21:40.257 --> 21:43.343
They even dared to disrespect God

21:43.427 --> 21:45.554
by attempting to hide the decree.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.600
However, they had a change of heart
in their final moments.

21:51.601 --> 21:54.980
They submitted themselves
to God's retribution,

21:55.063 --> 21:57.649
accepted the flames of purgation,
and went to Hell.

21:58.650 --> 22:04.031
That is the reason we pay tribute
and commemorate their deeds.

22:04.865 --> 22:09.036
And all of this
was God's merciful intervention,

22:09.619 --> 22:16.293
guiding us in the ways of repentance
and the pursuit of atonement for our sins.

22:16.376 --> 22:19.171
The Arrowhead!

22:30.766 --> 22:32.726
She's bringing out the big guns already!

22:33.226 --> 22:34.728
It's lighting a fire in my heart.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.693
I lost this arm
during Sinner Kim Minjae's demonstration.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.238
I threw myself over him
to join his demonstration,

22:46.198 --> 22:49.993
and the executors from Hell
burned it off alongside him.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.540
God… took my flesh,

22:56.333 --> 23:00.420
but He did not forgive Kim Minjae
for his sins.

23:01.797 --> 23:02.923
However,

23:04.007 --> 23:07.552
seeing all of you filled with such faith,

23:08.178 --> 23:11.431
I am certain
that things will be different today.

23:20.065 --> 23:24.861
Today, I stand here before you
to atone for my sins once again.

23:25.612 --> 23:29.032
When Sinner Jung Gyeongseok
faces his demonstration,

23:29.116 --> 23:33.412
I will again throw myself over him
to protect him.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.665
Thank you, Miss Sunshine.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.458
Everyone,

23:39.376 --> 23:41.211
are you with me?

23:43.296 --> 23:47.509
The Arrowhead!

23:47.592 --> 23:51.471
The Arrowhead!

24:13.243 --> 24:14.953
They're here!

24:15.036 --> 24:16.413
Hang in there!

24:17.122 --> 24:19.416
Three minutes from now!

24:21.835 --> 24:23.753
Hold your ground, everyone!

24:23.837 --> 24:24.796
You must hold on!

24:24.880 --> 24:27.966
Right. Bae Youngjae and Song Sohyun
held out for three minutes

24:28.049 --> 24:29.801
before facing their demonstration.

24:29.885 --> 24:33.763
That's what we're trying to reenact here.

24:37.017 --> 24:37.976
Go!

24:47.068 --> 24:48.487
Move out of the way!

24:52.699 --> 24:54.117
Pull him!

25:11.134 --> 25:12.093
Untie him!

25:15.430 --> 25:18.225
Stop it, you crazy bastards!

25:18.725 --> 25:20.101
I'm not going to die!

25:31.154 --> 25:32.572
What did I do wrong?

25:32.656 --> 25:33.990
Why do I have to die?

25:43.083 --> 25:43.959
Grab him!

25:48.421 --> 25:50.006
Stay away from me!

25:50.549 --> 25:52.259
Get away from me, motherfuckers!

26:01.977 --> 26:03.103
You are all crazy.

26:04.604 --> 26:06.022
You crazy bastards.

26:06.731 --> 26:07.899
You're all crazy.

26:18.118 --> 26:20.412
No.

26:20.495 --> 26:21.413
No!

26:26.793 --> 26:28.503
No!

26:28.587 --> 26:30.338
Pile on him!

27:26.019 --> 27:28.938
They… were not forgiven.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.858
Our dear Miss Sunshine

27:32.942 --> 27:35.528
has passed on
along with Sinner Jung Gyeongseok.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.989
Such a noble sacrifice!

27:39.449 --> 27:42.452
We were with her every step of the way…

27:44.537 --> 27:46.414
and God will take care of our souls.

27:46.498 --> 27:47.749
Yes, that's right.

27:49.125 --> 27:50.001
I'm certain.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.380
By the way…

27:56.216 --> 27:58.259
what the hell is the New Truth doing?

27:59.260 --> 28:00.512
What's Kim Jeongchil doing?

28:01.012 --> 28:03.848
Eight years have passed
since Chairman Jung Jinsu vanished,

28:03.932 --> 28:06.476
leaving behind a clue about God's will,

28:06.559 --> 28:09.020
but they're only spreading lies
to make personal gains.

28:09.104 --> 28:14.109
No one believes you're the ones
carrying out God's will anymore.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.027
Who on earth would believe that now?

28:16.820 --> 28:20.323
Kim Jeongchil is the real cult leader!

28:20.407 --> 28:23.993
We, the Arrowhead,
will not just sit back and watch.

28:24.077 --> 28:29.124
The New Truth is not embodying
God's message for humanity

28:29.207 --> 28:30.458
genuinely nor truthfully!

28:31.167 --> 28:33.795
We swear on our name
that we will not forgive you.

28:36.047 --> 28:36.881
The Arrowhead.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.216
The Arrowhead.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.134
The Arrowhead.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.760
The Arrowhead.

28:41.761 --> 28:42.721
The Arrowhead!

28:54.232 --> 28:56.818
IS KIM JEONGCHIL FOLLOWING
JUNG JINSU'S INTENTIONS?

28:56.901 --> 28:57.777
BY KIM SEOKCHEONG

28:57.861 --> 29:00.071
This goddamn bastard.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.283
How many were at my lecture today?

29:03.366 --> 29:06.202
Around 200, I think.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.789
How many seats were there?
A lot of them were empty.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.792
There were 400 seats,
but today is a weekday.

29:13.626 --> 29:16.671
It seems the Arrowhead reserved
most of the seats and then canceled.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.966
I don't get it.
What the hell is their problem?

29:20.675 --> 29:24.179
They wouldn't even exist
if it weren't for us.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.180
You're right.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.266
What's going on?

29:30.393 --> 29:32.312
For God's sake, these bastards.

29:36.232 --> 29:37.066
Hey! Back up!

29:37.650 --> 29:38.860
- Yes, sir!
- Drive!

29:38.943 --> 29:39.778
I'm on it!

29:40.862 --> 29:41.780
Fuck!

29:42.363 --> 29:43.740
Hey! Back up!

29:43.823 --> 29:45.074
Go! Hurry!

29:50.079 --> 29:51.581
Sir!

29:55.376 --> 29:56.336
- Get him!
- Come here!

29:57.212 --> 29:58.046
Kim Jeongchil!

30:03.384 --> 30:04.219
No!

30:26.241 --> 30:27.075
Get going!

30:40.380 --> 30:41.256
Sir!

30:42.507 --> 30:43.925
Sir!

30:45.385 --> 30:46.302
Are you okay?

30:51.891 --> 30:52.851
For fuck's sake!

30:57.313 --> 30:58.773
Get off!

31:22.213 --> 31:24.048
Sir!

31:29.470 --> 31:31.431
- Get the symbol off the car now!
- Yes, sir.

31:31.514 --> 31:34.601
- Didn't you know about the rally?
- We'll tighten security for the--

31:34.684 --> 31:36.436
Security? Are you kidding me?

31:36.519 --> 31:38.438
- No public events from now on.
- Yes, sir.

31:38.521 --> 31:41.232
Sir.
Senior Secretary Lee Sugyeong is here.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.568
Senior secretary? What's she doing here?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.114
Sorry, sir.

31:48.197 --> 31:51.117
She just barged in this morning,
demanding to see you.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.285
Where is she now?

31:52.368 --> 31:54.078
She's waiting in your office.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.464
Chairman Kim.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.092
- You can go.
- Yes, sir.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.851
Did you get hurt?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.020
Well, yes. Just a little.

32:19.103 --> 32:19.938
Dear me.

32:20.021 --> 32:21.856
Those Arrowhead bastards.

32:23.024 --> 32:26.903
You even moved your main office
to the outskirts of Seoul to avoid them.

32:28.196 --> 32:30.031
But you're still having a tough time.

32:34.369 --> 32:35.787
It's a pleasure to meet you.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.123
I'm Lee Sugyeong,
senior secretary to the president.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.126
Right!

32:43.586 --> 32:46.381
I just love mountains.

32:46.464 --> 32:49.592
I try to go hiking whenever I can.
That's why I look like this.

32:51.844 --> 32:55.682
The new government just took office.
I'm not familiar with all the new faces.

32:55.765 --> 32:56.975
Right.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.434
Can I get you a drink?

33:04.857 --> 33:09.362
These days, nobody really cares
what the government does, do they?

33:10.154 --> 33:12.949
It's the age of religion now, you know.

33:13.950 --> 33:16.744
So what can I do for you,
Senior Secretary Lee?

33:20.581 --> 33:22.000
The president

33:23.251 --> 33:26.671
is deeply concerned about the way
things are in the world these days.

33:28.589 --> 33:31.259
The baby's demonstration
significantly weakened

33:31.342 --> 33:33.344
the New Truth's influence, didn't it?

33:34.804 --> 33:39.600
The Arrowhead interpreted the case first
and used it to expand its power,

33:40.101 --> 33:41.269
and now, well,

33:42.520 --> 33:45.732
they are flouting the entire legal system.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.694
Those crazy bastards
are inciting terror all over the place.

33:49.777 --> 33:53.489
What's the point of the police
catching them and taking them to court?

33:53.573 --> 33:55.158
If they don't like the verdict,

33:55.241 --> 33:59.203
they dox the judges
and terrorize them too.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.623
So who would give them
the punishment they deserve?

34:05.084 --> 34:06.002
At this rate,

34:06.753 --> 34:10.548
those maniacs will soon be controlling
the whole country.

34:15.303 --> 34:18.514
There are frauds everywhere.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.603
But still,
a fraud with dignity like the New Truth

34:24.437 --> 34:27.607
is a touch better, don't you think?

34:29.484 --> 34:31.444
What? Fraud?

34:34.530 --> 34:35.364
Why?

34:37.366 --> 34:38.409
Aren't you a fraud?

34:47.293 --> 34:48.252
Chairman Kim.

34:50.004 --> 34:51.422
We must bring it back.

34:52.340 --> 34:56.969
We must bring the world back
to the place where rules stand.

34:57.053 --> 34:59.931
The Arrowhead has already
spread like cancer,

35:00.014 --> 35:01.724
so how do we do that?

35:01.808 --> 35:06.604
The moment Park Jungja's demonstration
was broadcast to the entire nation,

35:06.687 --> 35:09.816
the world crossed the Rubicon.

35:09.899 --> 35:13.277
But we still need to maintain
some level of control.

35:14.028 --> 35:18.074
A society without rules cannot survive.

35:18.574 --> 35:19.408
So,

35:20.868 --> 35:26.958
let's find a way together
to make people listen to the New Truth.

35:28.543 --> 35:31.379
So, what? You want us
to come up with a new doctrine?

35:32.213 --> 35:36.717
We were the first to interpret
the newborn's demonstration.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.262
The Arrowhead just copied what we did.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.305
Sure, I'm well aware.

35:41.848 --> 35:44.225
I know that whatever
the Arrowhead and New Truth say,

35:44.308 --> 35:46.602
it's pretty much the same thing.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.981
But what do you think makes
the Arrowhead's voice louder?

35:51.149 --> 35:53.860
Frankly speaking,
has anyone from the New Truth

35:53.943 --> 35:56.821
thrown themselves
at these so-called "flames of purgation"?

35:56.904 --> 35:58.114
- No.
- That's…

35:59.740 --> 36:03.661
That is a blasphemous sin
that distorts God's will

36:03.744 --> 36:05.788
and obstructs His divine intervention!

36:06.581 --> 36:09.292
I'm not asking you
to throw yourself at them.

36:09.375 --> 36:10.960
Don't get worked up.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.713
What's important is
to have something symbolic.

36:14.213 --> 36:17.967
The New Truth also needs
a symbolic figure like that.

36:18.050 --> 36:21.053
The story doesn't matter,
but the character does.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.055
You need a compelling character.

36:24.098 --> 36:25.558
A character?

36:29.979 --> 36:32.023
Is that how you wanna play it?

36:42.575 --> 36:45.953
My staff had to work really hard
to find this.

37:01.552 --> 37:02.678
How did you…

37:15.191 --> 37:18.402
The New Truth has Park Jungja now, right?

37:25.785 --> 37:26.994
Where is she?

38:04.824 --> 38:06.492
How long have you kept her here?

38:07.952 --> 38:11.414
Four years ago, our security caught her
walking out of the sacred site

38:12.248 --> 38:14.583
when she came back to life.

38:15.418 --> 38:17.670
How is she? Is she able to talk?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.800
It's only been a year
since she started talking to us.

38:24.385 --> 38:27.596
Before then,
she just kept muttering gibberish

38:28.681 --> 38:31.475
and calling out her children's names,
Eunyul and Hayul.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.354
I think she might tell us something
if she sees her kids,

38:35.938 --> 38:38.274
but Sodo hid them so well.

38:39.275 --> 38:42.361
So you've found out nothing so far?

38:45.406 --> 38:48.909
Didn't she talk about Hell
or something like that?

38:50.619 --> 38:53.456
Indeed, she talks,
but no one can understand her.

38:53.539 --> 38:55.666
What she says doesn't make sense.

38:55.750 --> 38:59.962
She just talks to herself
rather than responding to our questions.

39:00.671 --> 39:04.175
It's impossible to find a truth
that the public would understand.

39:09.972 --> 39:12.391
There's no such thing as the truth!

39:13.142 --> 39:14.018
Man.

39:18.397 --> 39:22.985
It's funny how a cult leader
is seeking the truth.

39:24.695 --> 39:27.990
Have you lied so much
you've started to believe your own lies?

39:34.455 --> 39:35.623
Listen carefully.

39:36.540 --> 39:39.668
If the opposition
wins a majority in the assembly,

39:39.752 --> 39:42.671
it will be the Arrowhead's world.

39:43.422 --> 39:45.758
Anarchy without any rules whatsoever.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.427
Would they take it that far?

39:48.969 --> 39:50.846
Opposition or not, they're politicians.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.556
That's exactly why.

39:53.432 --> 39:56.644
All they ever care about
is the election ahead of them.

39:56.727 --> 39:57.728
Don't you know that?

39:58.979 --> 40:01.399
What the government badly wants

40:02.316 --> 40:04.360
is an ideology that can be controlled.

40:05.194 --> 40:07.238
What exactly are you suggesting?

40:09.532 --> 40:12.159
The government will provide all resources,

40:12.243 --> 40:14.370
whether they are financial or human.

40:14.870 --> 40:19.333
We should elevate Park Jungja
above the New Truth or the Arrowhead

40:19.417 --> 40:23.796
and use her to announce
the new doctrine for a new society.

40:24.672 --> 40:29.343
We will use this opportunity
to write a doctrine with principles

40:29.927 --> 40:34.306
that can define the Arrowhead as a cult
and restore some social order.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.310
Do you understand what I mean?

40:46.402 --> 40:51.073
In six months, we'll have a grand revival
with Park Jungja in the spotlight.

41:18.851 --> 41:23.522
We train her to announce the doctrine
even if it means hiring a circus trainer.

41:24.023 --> 41:26.609
She's not the only one
who received a demonstration.

41:27.109 --> 41:30.613
What if someone else comes back to life
and says something different?

41:31.113 --> 41:35.784
Like I told you earlier,
what's important is the character.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.579
Not everyone can become a symbol

41:38.662 --> 41:40.706
just because they rise from the dead.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.626
The only people who can be one

41:43.709 --> 41:46.629
are Park Jungja and the baby
whose demonstration failed.

41:47.213 --> 41:49.965
We're still looking for the baby.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.135
But for now, we have Park Jungja,

41:53.219 --> 41:56.764
so let's go ahead
and make a new doctrine through her.

42:00.976 --> 42:05.314
There's one more person
who can be this symbol you speak of.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.400
And who is that?

42:08.484 --> 42:10.110
Chairman Jung Jinsu.

42:11.278 --> 42:16.951
Didn't he disappear eight years ago?
I thought he was traveling or something.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.245
No one's heard from him since.

42:20.287 --> 42:21.956
He was subjected to a demonstration.

42:24.750 --> 42:25.709
I see.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.088
So that's what happened.

42:29.171 --> 42:31.382
He received a decree decades ago.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.842
That's how he found the New Truth.

42:34.718 --> 42:38.013
He recommended me as the next chairman
in exchange for my silence.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.433
If Jung Jinsu
comes back to life and returns,

42:41.517 --> 42:45.604
he could create
greater chaos than the Arrowhead.

42:46.188 --> 42:49.191
Even if we come up with a doctrine
that people could accept,

42:49.942 --> 42:52.778
they'd still believe Jung Jinsu instead.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.826
Where did his demonstration take place?

42:59.743 --> 43:00.744
I have no idea.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.541
There's someone who might know.

43:07.001 --> 43:07.918
Who's that?

43:10.588 --> 43:14.842
He said he was going to meet a detective
right before his demonstration.

43:16.176 --> 43:17.886
A detective named Jin Kyunghun.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.140
He said he would leave the world
to this person.

43:23.559 --> 43:24.768
"Leave the world"?

43:25.561 --> 43:27.771
And did the detective
do anything after that?

43:30.399 --> 43:31.358
He disappeared.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.402
Without doing anything.

43:35.738 --> 43:36.739
Jin Kyunghun.

43:37.990 --> 43:38.824
Okay.

43:39.825 --> 43:43.996
It seems like we need to find him first
by any means necessary.

44:16.487 --> 44:19.406
The New Truth are making
fools of themselves again.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.783
Fucking idiots.

44:22.451 --> 44:26.372
The whole world was spoon-fed to them,
but they ruined it. Crazy bastards.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.503
Don't stay up too late, Heejung.

44:34.046 --> 44:35.172
I'm off to work.

44:53.732 --> 44:54.733
Heejung.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.742
Get up. Take these.

45:04.243 --> 45:06.704
Take these pills.
They'll make you feel better.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.372
Take them.

45:17.881 --> 45:18.799
You'll be okay.

45:20.092 --> 45:22.094
You'll feel better soon.

45:24.346 --> 45:25.931
The pills will help.

45:26.014 --> 45:26.890
It's okay.
