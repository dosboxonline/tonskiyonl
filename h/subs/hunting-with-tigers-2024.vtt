Facing ruthless cruelty,
man does not give in to tigers

00:23.208 --> 00:24.833
or hyenas.
Arthur Schopenhauer

00:25.583 --> 00:26.791
Principles are principles,

00:26.916 --> 00:29.708
even if the streets run with blood.
Rudyard Kipling

02:25.125 --> 02:26.291
Police! Don't move.

02:26.375 --> 02:27.916
Show me your hands!

02:28.250 --> 02:29.833
Call in backup!

02:29.916 --> 02:31.208
On your knees!

02:33.333 --> 02:35.000
Hands behind your back!

02:35.125 --> 02:37.000
Hands behind your back!

02:39.375 --> 02:41.791
Don't move!

03:10.875 --> 03:13.791
I was still sleeping
when they broke down the door.

03:14.125 --> 03:15.666
At least 20 of them.

03:18.333 --> 03:20.708
-What did they find?
-Nothing.

03:21.416 --> 03:24.416
Just a gun.
It had been there for a long time.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.083
I'd already seen it
while putting groceries away.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.708
They were disappointed.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.500
Mom, what did they say to you?

03:30.583 --> 03:34.416
They said, "Ma'am, your husband
and other men have been arrested."

03:34.791 --> 03:36.250
Well, he's done for.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.500
I didn't know you were here.

03:47.416 --> 03:49.375
I got here two days ago.

03:50.916 --> 03:54.208
Does it take something like this
for you to come see me?

03:59.458 --> 04:02.375

04:50.125 --> 04:53.457
The Fontainebleau Gang trial
begins today in Paris.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.916
The trial will last three weeks.

04:56.332 --> 04:58.000
The four gang members,

04:58.082 --> 05:00.791
arrested a year ago
before a fresh robbery attempt,

05:00.916 --> 05:03.000
are accused of murdering two officers

05:03.125 --> 05:05.458
during the attack on a Shielder van.

05:05.541 --> 05:08.083
Among them, repeat offender Chérif Zaoui.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.957
Hello.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.500
Ladies and gentlemen,

05:55.707 --> 05:58.875
what you just saw
was footage from the robbery

05:58.957 --> 06:01.916
which cost the lives
of two brave police officers

06:03.000 --> 06:05.083
who were called to the scene.

06:07.166 --> 06:11.333
Their vehicle was riddled with bullets
from military-grade guns.

06:11.791 --> 06:14.208
The guns that were fired
were the same ones

06:14.291 --> 06:17.375
found one month later in the hotel room

06:17.457 --> 06:19.250
where this very same gang

06:19.332 --> 06:21.750
was preparing to carry out
their next attack.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.875
Excuse me, Your Honor,
but my client, Mr. Zaoui,

06:24.957 --> 06:27.875
was not present in this room
at the time of arrest.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.332
You've just seen the video.

06:30.416 --> 06:32.666
The gang is made up of five members.

06:32.750 --> 06:36.541
Four people stand before us in the dock.

06:36.875 --> 06:39.625
The firth alleged member
was shot dead by the police

06:39.707 --> 06:42.832
during an operation,
when he grabbed a firearm.

06:42.916 --> 06:46.041
I must not have been clear.
So let me ask again.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.500
Was my client, Mr. Chérif Zaoui,

06:48.582 --> 06:51.457
present in the hotel room
when they were arrested?

06:51.541 --> 06:54.875
Could he be seen on CCTV footage

06:54.957 --> 06:56.916
in the vicinity of the hotel?

06:57.000 --> 07:01.291
Your client was photographed
alongside two members of the group

07:01.375 --> 07:03.625
48 hours before his arrest,

07:03.708 --> 07:06.000
in a cafe near Paris.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.625
And this was while he was on the run

07:08.708 --> 07:12.083
following the attack
on an armored van in Switzerland.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.791
Let's stick to this case.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.583
The defendants may know each other

07:15.666 --> 07:18.666
but does that prove Mr. Zaoui
was at the scene of the video

07:18.750 --> 07:20.875
or with the people beside him today?

07:20.957 --> 07:24.332
The people, who, may I remind you,
were arrested together.

07:24.416 --> 07:25.916
All you have is a photo?

07:26.291 --> 07:30.457
Does that mean everybody
who has crossed paths with these people

07:30.541 --> 07:32.875
are potential accomplices?

07:33.625 --> 07:36.207
Let me remind this court

07:36.291 --> 07:39.166
that it was Ousmane Diop,
Karim Taïeb and Serge Lamy

07:39.250 --> 07:41.707
who were arrested together in a hotel room

07:41.791 --> 07:43.750
with weapons that had already been used.

07:44.332 --> 07:48.000
Any attempt to link my client to this case

07:48.082 --> 07:51.041
is therefore misleading.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.582
Thank you, Your Honor.

07:52.666 --> 07:56.291
We will resume proceedings
after a one-hour break.

08:05.166 --> 08:08.000
Want something to eat?
Cigarettes maybe?

08:08.083 --> 08:10.208
No, I already have cigarettes.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.041
Go get me a sandwich.

08:25.957 --> 08:28.166
-Your sandwich, sir.
-Thanks.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.915
How's he doing?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.207
Is he tired?

08:40.457 --> 08:45.000
No, he's fine.
He's determined to fight his case.

08:45.083 --> 08:46.915
He has the energy.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.333
He doesn't seem defeated.

08:48.415 --> 08:51.958
Maybe so, but he's not so young anymore.
I know what he's like.

08:54.083 --> 08:55.958
-One coffee.
-Thanks.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.750
You know, Malik,
I think I'll go home.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.916
I can't bear to see him like this.
Or him to see me like this.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.583
It'll destroy the both of us.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.708
-And you...
-What about me?

09:13.791 --> 09:15.583
Go back to Spain.

09:16.166 --> 09:19.958
There's no point in staying here.
The cards have been dealt.

09:20.041 --> 09:22.416
You have your own life to live.

09:23.875 --> 09:26.708
Serge made his choice.
You can't help him now.

09:30.291 --> 09:33.500
You don't owe him anything.
Even if you think you do.

09:36.415 --> 09:40.040
Get out of here.
Come see me when it's all over.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.125
Are you with us?

10:38.875 --> 10:40.375
Here.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.290
It's a white Ford Transit van.

10:43.375 --> 10:45.790
With graffiti,
a van with an 89 number plate.

10:46.833 --> 10:49.290
Parked at the supermarket in Livry-Gargan.

10:49.375 --> 10:51.458
On Friday, my guys smashed the CCTV cams.

10:51.540 --> 10:55.000
They won't fix them until Monday,
so you've got the whole weekend.

10:56.165 --> 10:58.833
Cool. Will do.

10:58.915 --> 11:00.916
Can we chill now? Drink or hookah?

11:01.000 --> 11:04.166
I'd have loved to,
but I'm up early tomorrow.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.791
-No way.
-Sorry.

11:05.875 --> 11:08.125
But it's my birthday. Come on.

11:08.208 --> 11:11.291
Come here. Check it out.
We're gonna have fun.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.500
Having balance troubles?

11:50.583 --> 11:54.165
I'm not drunk.
I just can't walk in these heels.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.165
Where you you going? Need a lift home?

11:56.250 --> 11:58.000
No, I'm fine, thanks.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.458
-I'll take you home.
-I want to go home.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.625
That's what I'm saying.
I'll drop you off.

12:04.541 --> 12:06.208
-You swear?
-Malik!

12:06.291 --> 12:07.791
-I swear.
-Malik!

12:08.208 --> 12:10.500
Wait for me here.
I'll say goodbye to him.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.583
Next time, we'll have some real fun.

12:16.666 --> 12:20.166
It's okay, bro, you had to leave early,
and you stayed until closing time.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.458
Not bad for a birthday, right?

12:23.458 --> 12:26.333
-What's the matter? Does it hurt?
-Yes.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.708
These heels are killing me.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.791
Want me to carry you?

12:31.458 --> 12:33.208
Really?

12:33.290 --> 12:34.458
If you want me to.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.583
-You sure? You okay?
-Yes.

12:38.665 --> 12:40.125
Go!

12:41.540 --> 12:43.583
-Oh, wow, damn it.
-Stop it.

12:43.665 --> 12:45.790
You sure are heavy.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.000
Shut up!

12:53.040 --> 12:54.750
Feeling better?

12:55.540 --> 12:57.165
Yeah. Thanks a lot.

12:59.083 --> 13:01.166
-Is this your car?
-Yeah.

13:06.666 --> 13:09.208
I don't get it.
What's with the license plate?

13:09.291 --> 13:12.833
I live in Spain.
What's your name?

13:12.916 --> 13:15.791
Estelle. And yours?

13:15.875 --> 13:17.583
Malik.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.708
Want me to give you a lift?

13:21.541 --> 13:24.250
-Yes, okay.
-Yes?

14:13.583 --> 14:14.666
Hello?

14:14.750 --> 14:16.083
Malik?

14:18.583 --> 14:22.458
This is Iris Valois.
I'm Chérif Zaoui's lawyer.

14:22.541 --> 14:24.500
Would it be possible to meet?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.166
Why?

14:28.250 --> 14:30.583
I'd rather speak to you about it
in person.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.875
-When?
-Right away.

14:38.208 --> 14:40.208
It's also about your stepfather.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.416
Malik?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.583
Would you like a coffee?

15:11.875 --> 15:13.541
Please, take a seat.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.458
How did you get my number?

15:20.625 --> 15:22.416
We all have our own phone book.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.291
Go ahead.

15:26.250 --> 15:28.458
I know it's very early.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.375
And you don't spend your nights alone.

15:32.750 --> 15:36.583
Someone must be disappointed. Sorry.
I'll get straight to the point.

15:37.833 --> 15:40.665
My client would like to make you an offer.

15:40.750 --> 15:44.208
-I don't know Chérif.
-He doesn't know you either.

15:45.250 --> 15:49.125
Why would I talk to a robber
accused of killing cops?

15:51.040 --> 15:53.333
You talk to Serge Lamy, don't you?

15:54.165 --> 15:57.500
My client has nothing to do
with this affair.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.000
If you say so.

16:00.083 --> 16:04.208
Serge, Chérif and the others are screwed,
everyone knows it.

16:04.291 --> 16:08.500
But my client has nothing to do with
the group in the dock.

16:08.583 --> 16:11.333
He always refused to work with them.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.458
Not professional enough, too violent.

16:13.541 --> 16:15.875
But the courts have decided otherwise.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.166
And?

16:19.250 --> 16:23.125
My client can help Serge Lamy.
He knows your connection.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.708
Serge is my stepfather. That's no secret.

16:25.791 --> 16:28.791
It's no secret
he was convicted for murder either.

16:29.791 --> 16:33.040
In the minds of jury,
seeing as he's already killed once...

16:34.165 --> 16:37.040
he's obviously the one
that shot the police officers.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.790
He'll spend his life in prison.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.040
So even if he could afford
the very best lawyers in the country

16:46.125 --> 16:48.665
or even the world,

16:48.750 --> 16:50.750
I don't see how
he could get out of this.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.540
So you think it's a losing battle.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.375
Why would I waste my time
listening to some offer?

17:01.833 --> 17:04.375
Serge isn't just your stepfather.

17:06.790 --> 17:09.790
He did something for you.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.290
In that cafe in Sartrouville.

17:16.790 --> 17:20.750
You were in deep shit
and he sacrificed himself for you.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.000
Who told you that?

17:23.083 --> 17:25.333
Paris is a very small city.

17:25.415 --> 17:28.625
I know a lot of thugs. More than you do.

17:29.791 --> 17:33.291
I know what you do.
You smuggle in from Spain.

17:33.375 --> 17:36.458
You've been supporting your mom
for the past year.

17:36.541 --> 17:39.041
You've been bringing food to your stepdad.

17:39.125 --> 17:42.250
If you really want to help them,
isn't now a good time

17:42.333 --> 17:44.583
to consider this kind of offer?

17:45.166 --> 17:47.333
I think we're done here.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.500
Call me back if you change your mind.

17:49.583 --> 17:51.416
No, I won't change my mind.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.750
It's funny. I told him you'd say no.

17:53.833 --> 17:56.166
You know why?

17:57.291 --> 18:00.583
Because he's your stepfather,
not your biological father.

18:00.666 --> 18:04.291
So there's no reason
for your to have inherited his bravery.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.958
I didn't know he was your wife's son.

18:22.041 --> 18:24.291
Or we'd have settled things differently.

18:24.875 --> 18:27.333
You'll need to keep an eye on him.

18:27.791 --> 18:31.041
This is my territory.
I can't let him get away with it.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.625
You'd do the same if you were me.

18:33.708 --> 18:35.833
I don't sell drugs.
I don't have these issues.

18:35.916 --> 18:37.583
You know what I mean.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.791
You have your own team problems.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.458
Except that we...

18:42.750 --> 18:44.791
don't take guys down into the cellar.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.583
Once again, I'm within my rights.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.500
We have friends in common.
You're respected.

18:50.791 --> 18:52.916
And I'm sitting on cash here.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.750
But you've got to keep your eye on him.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.583
If he ever does that again,

18:57.666 --> 18:59.250
he won't get off so lightly.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.750
Is that so?

19:02.708 --> 19:03.875
What's the matter?

19:04.875 --> 19:06.875
Did you think I was going to say sorry?

19:07.458 --> 19:09.583
There's something you don't understand.

19:09.666 --> 19:12.208
I make the decisions around here, not you.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.500
What do I have to do?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.958
You have to find someone.
And bring them back to France.

20:24.041 --> 20:26.125
I know this is Avi's place.

20:28.208 --> 20:30.166
I'll be outside.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.125
Who are you?

21:18.458 --> 21:20.541
-Are you Avi?
-Who are you?

21:21.833 --> 21:23.625
I'm here on behalf of Chérif.

21:23.708 --> 21:25.250
Do you think I'm an idiot?

21:26.000 --> 21:29.083
-His lawyer sent me.
-What for?

21:29.166 --> 21:32.291
She's got a message for you.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.375
I'm with him now. Shall I put him on?

21:47.833 --> 21:49.416
Yes?

21:55.625 --> 21:58.041
I need to discuss it with him?

22:09.375 --> 22:11.000
Who are you, really?

22:11.750 --> 22:13.500
I'm nobody.

22:15.916 --> 22:19.333
Then why show up dressed like a Colombian?

22:19.416 --> 22:22.083
I'm here because I'm busted in France.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.666
And you've come to talk business.
Who are you?

22:25.875 --> 22:27.875
A lost kid from the ghetto?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.833
-Is Chérif your mentor or something?
-I don't know him.

22:31.916 --> 22:33.833
Then what's the deal?

22:34.583 --> 22:36.958
So you rob trucks
without knowing their cargo

22:37.041 --> 22:39.208
and are sick of only finding boxes of gum.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.208
Then a thug sentenced to life in jail

22:42.291 --> 22:43.791
approaches you with a golden ticket.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.458
Only that no longer exists.

22:45.541 --> 22:47.000
But you bought it, right?

22:47.958 --> 22:50.083
My stepfather is in the dock with Chérif.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.500
-Who's your stepfather?
-Serge Lamy.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.583
-All right.
-I just want to help him.

22:59.666 --> 23:02.666
And how will taking on some job help him?

23:02.750 --> 23:05.208
All I know
is what the lawyer told us both.

23:05.291 --> 23:09.708
I know no more than you. So either
come listen to her or I'll go back alone.

23:09.791 --> 23:12.125
Just save me the lecture, I'm not a kid.

24:04.041 --> 24:06.083
My clients can be eccentric, but this...

24:06.166 --> 24:09.625
I'm not your client. Plus, I'm suspicious.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.250
If all your clients were like me,

24:11.333 --> 24:13.208
you'd only have domestic violence cases.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.500
I've traveled 2,000 miles
to listen to you.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.666
And I'm not the most patient of people.

24:20.666 --> 24:22.750
Chérif has a job to offer you.

24:23.041 --> 24:25.875
Fifteen million euros.
In cash. Untraceable.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.291
Chérif only wants two million.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.750
Those who come on board
will share the rest.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.333
What's the catch?

24:36.166 --> 24:39.708
Chérif wants you to help him escape,
along with one other inmate.

24:39.791 --> 24:41.708
His stepfather.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.291
And one more thing.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.416
You'll have to be part of it.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.625
Me? Why's that?

24:48.708 --> 24:52.291
If the job goes ahead,
Chérif wants you to be part of it.

24:52.375 --> 24:53.875
To ensure trust.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.791
But that's not what we'd agreed on.

24:55.875 --> 24:58.208
Why would I get into something like this?

24:58.291 --> 25:00.791
I'm just telling you
what he told me to say.

25:00.875 --> 25:03.416
You either in, or there's no job.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.041
That wasn't the deal.
I just had to get him here.

25:06.125 --> 25:08.041
You got screwed over, buddy.

25:08.916 --> 25:12.208
What's in it for you?
Are you in love with him or what?

25:12.791 --> 25:15.875
You think only men
are interested in money?

25:17.250 --> 25:19.125
I know he's no angel, but my client

25:19.208 --> 25:20.916
was not part of that armed robbery.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.541
We just want to bring him down
and I like to fight the system.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.333
If we add money, then I'm smiling.

25:26.416 --> 25:30.833
But we're not here to discuss my reasons.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.916
I can't leave this place
without an answer.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.166
My client made me promise.

25:36.250 --> 25:38.666
Your client is a childhood friend of mine.

25:38.750 --> 25:42.250
We've done dozens of jobs as a team.

25:43.416 --> 25:48.041
But I refuse to take the fall for him.
Nobody puts that kind of pressure on me.

25:48.875 --> 25:51.208
What's stopping you from deciding?

25:51.291 --> 25:54.291
He wants a yes or a no
before providing the details?

25:54.375 --> 25:57.125
-Yes.
-That doesn't work for me.

25:57.791 --> 26:00.541
I like to know
what I'm getting myself into.

26:00.625 --> 26:03.083
And to know the number of men I'll need.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.250
Chérif says you'll need four men.

26:05.541 --> 26:08.416
Not so easy to find nowadays.

26:08.916 --> 26:11.250
Four solid men
to get into serious trouble.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.250
A robbery and a break-out.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.458
I'm not sure I'll be able to.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.375
I'll let you check that out.

26:17.791 --> 26:20.041
But you'd better hurry.

26:20.458 --> 26:22.583
The job is next Saturday.

26:24.166 --> 26:27.583
Then, you'll have one week
to get them out.

26:43.666 --> 26:46.666
Angel, you've got a call from France.

26:48.291 --> 26:49.791
Hello?

26:49.875 --> 26:51.458
Who?

26:59.291 --> 27:01.875
I called a friend.
He'll be there tomorrow.

27:01.958 --> 27:03.500
What friend?

27:03.583 --> 27:05.291
A friend.

27:06.416 --> 27:08.250
Is he down?

27:08.416 --> 27:11.500
I don't know. We'll see.

27:12.875 --> 27:14.791
So what do we do?

27:15.333 --> 27:17.416
The whole thing stinks.

27:17.708 --> 27:19.041
What are you thinking?

27:19.708 --> 27:21.708
I'm ready to do it.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.250
Just like that?

27:24.333 --> 27:26.791
A leap in the dark.
Without knowing the details.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.916
I see you're pumped.

27:30.083 --> 27:31.875
What are you? A dealer?

27:31.958 --> 27:34.166
Moving drugs? A craftsman?

27:34.708 --> 27:36.708
What do you know about heists?

27:36.791 --> 27:38.500
Nothing.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.041
Where about is the Saint-Martin Canal?

27:43.125 --> 27:45.333
-That way?
-Over there.

27:45.416 --> 27:46.833
-Right?
-Why?

27:46.916 --> 27:49.166
I want to skip stones.

27:49.250 --> 27:52.083
Like in the movie Amélie.
It'll help me focus.

27:52.166 --> 27:53.791
Wait for me at your place.

27:53.875 --> 27:56.333
Don't move until you hear from me.

28:07.791 --> 28:10.791
Scandinavian, 1954, exactly.

28:12.041 --> 28:15.041
-It would work.
-Yes, I think so.

28:16.083 --> 28:18.708
-How much is it?
-3,200 euros.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.041
Is that your best price?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.250
-Sorry?
-Is that your best price?

28:27.375 --> 28:29.458
Yes, it is.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.500
Okay.

28:34.291 --> 28:37.750
Do your customers know that the nerdy boss

28:37.833 --> 28:40.416
hit the cash vault
in Arceuil in 2002?

28:40.500 --> 28:43.125
No, but if you speak any louder,
then they might.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.166
So that's what you did with the cash?

28:46.875 --> 28:48.958
I came across a Le Corbusier book in jail.

28:49.041 --> 28:51.000
I liked it and made it my career.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.041
Le Corbusier is great, you know?

28:57.750 --> 28:58.875
Why are you here?

28:58.958 --> 29:03.125
-Am I not allowed to buy a sofa?
-I know that's not why you're here.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.791
It's huge.

29:09.791 --> 29:12.166
-I sell sofas now, Avi.
-Really huge.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.541
How much?

29:15.708 --> 29:17.583
Around three million each.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.458
Francs?

29:20.541 --> 29:22.458
Euros.

29:23.625 --> 29:25.291
That's unheard of these days.

29:25.375 --> 29:27.625
You think I'd have come out
of hiding if not?

29:29.666 --> 29:31.041
Is this your plan?

29:31.125 --> 29:33.583
No. Chérif's.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.375
Chérif is not as his best.

29:38.875 --> 29:40.208
You're desperate.

29:40.291 --> 29:42.250
-No.
-Yes. You have nobody else.

29:42.333 --> 29:44.916
I'm not going to lie. It's been ten years.

29:45.791 --> 29:47.291
Why me?

29:47.375 --> 29:49.875
Competent guys
are hard to find these days.

29:50.750 --> 29:52.666
Nobody can play people like you do.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.416
Enough flattery.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.583
-Who else have you asked?
-No one, yet.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.458
How long do you need to decide?

30:07.250 --> 30:08.750
Is two days okay?

30:11.791 --> 30:14.166
I don't want to see you around here again.

31:11.291 --> 31:12.333
Hey, big shot!

31:12.416 --> 31:14.458
What are you doing here?

31:14.541 --> 31:15.791
Took you long enough.

31:15.875 --> 31:17.125
Huh?

31:17.208 --> 31:18.958
Nice place you've got.

31:21.125 --> 31:22.416
Hey, Avi?

31:23.666 --> 31:25.583
Nice neighborhood. Hop on.

31:25.791 --> 31:27.291
Come on.

31:35.500 --> 31:38.500
CAFÉ DES INDES
INDIAN RESTAURANT

31:51.708 --> 31:54.000
I gunned it. No one followed us.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.000
Angel, Malik. Malik, Angel.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.875
Take a seat.

32:02.625 --> 32:04.583
I don't drink, thanks.

32:04.666 --> 32:06.458
You don't drink alcohol?

32:14.666 --> 32:16.750
I'm not here for a drink.

32:16.833 --> 32:19.458
I want to know
if we're working together or not.

32:20.833 --> 32:23.833
I brought us together. Yes or no?
I'm not here to waste time.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.416
You're not here to what?

32:28.541 --> 32:30.166
Can we trust you?

32:30.916 --> 32:33.041
Or will you land us in the slammer?

32:33.125 --> 32:34.416
Believe what you want.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.666
Why do you want to work with us?

32:36.750 --> 32:38.625
I'm here for my stepfather.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.333
Why do you give a shit about him?

32:40.416 --> 32:42.458
He's just your mother's man, not your dad.

32:42.541 --> 32:44.541
You're gonna risk it all for him?

32:44.625 --> 32:46.750
-I owe him.
-You owe him what?

32:46.833 --> 32:48.166
Huh?

32:48.250 --> 32:50.416
He took out some guys for me.

32:56.416 --> 32:57.500
Okay, tell us.

33:08.708 --> 33:12.250
When I was a kid,
I was kidnapped and tortured for a week.

33:22.750 --> 33:26.166
When Serge found out,
he killed them and got 17 years for me.

33:26.250 --> 33:29.208
He destroyed his life for me.
That's why I owe him.

33:32.750 --> 33:35.208
Give this back to me unloaded.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.000
What?

33:45.958 --> 33:47.583
You see that?

33:48.958 --> 33:51.166
I wasn't raised by just anyone.

34:03.916 --> 34:05.916
So you're doing this out of honor?

34:06.000 --> 34:07.750
That's nice.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.500
That way we can keep his share.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.500
He's not in it for the money.

34:21.125 --> 34:23.291
Take your cape and mask
and wait outside, Zorro.

34:24.625 --> 34:26.083
Go on.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.791
-It's fine by me.
-Is it?

34:36.083 --> 34:39.250
I'm not vouching for anyone
but he's not in it for the cash.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.291
How many kids his age
step up for the right reasons?

34:42.375 --> 34:43.916
Who will our fourth man be?

34:44.958 --> 34:46.541
The fourth man...

34:50.916 --> 34:52.541
Azzedine.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.333
Call the shark and tell her it's on.

35:08.416 --> 35:10.083
How did you find me?

35:10.166 --> 35:12.500
-What?
-How did you find me here?

35:19.083 --> 35:21.166
You've got a lot to learn.

35:27.791 --> 35:30.708
A drug dealer
with no signal jammer on board?

36:12.916 --> 36:15.083
-So?
-I didn't read it.

36:15.166 --> 36:18.583
Of course you didn't.
Are you illiterate too?

36:19.958 --> 36:22.583
We're robbing the kickback
from Brice Traoré's family.

36:22.666 --> 36:23.916
Who's that?

36:24.000 --> 36:26.500
-The Arsenal striker.
-A machine.

36:26.583 --> 36:29.583
He's 19 and scored 29 goals in one season.

36:29.666 --> 36:31.583
Paris wants to sign him for 90 million.

36:31.666 --> 36:33.458
His family will get 15 million.

36:33.541 --> 36:36.208
His father is his agent.
It's part of the contact.

36:36.291 --> 36:38.750
The kickback will be paid in cash.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.958
Isn't that insane?

36:51.625 --> 36:52.958
Oh, Chérif.

36:55.375 --> 36:56.208
Good day.

36:56.291 --> 36:59.416
The cash will go from a downtown bank
to their suburb home.

37:00.458 --> 37:03.291
So we wait for the cash drop-off
and hold up the family?

37:03.375 --> 37:05.125
No, there's a huge team on-site.

37:05.208 --> 37:06.791
And with the connections he has

37:06.875 --> 37:08.708
the entire hood will be on our back.

37:08.791 --> 37:10.625
How are you?

37:10.708 --> 37:14.416
-We are looking for vehicles...
-How many cars?

37:14.500 --> 37:17.500
-I don't know.
-There'll be armed security, for sure.

37:17.583 --> 37:20.375
Knowing the Qataris, there'll be a van.

37:20.458 --> 37:22.375
We need to locate the rental company.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.666
There can't be that many around Paris.

37:24.750 --> 37:26.458
Ahmed Zermani?

37:26.541 --> 37:30.083
That's right. Pleased to meet you.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.958
Before we see the vans, please remind me

37:33.041 --> 37:36.208
-who you were working for.
-Hello, Bachir Zermani.

37:36.291 --> 37:40.625
We are looking for
ultra-secure vehicles...

37:40.708 --> 37:42.250
The Algerian government.

37:42.333 --> 37:45.375
And how did you find out about us?

37:45.458 --> 37:51.208
From a close friend who provides security
for the Emir of Qatar.

37:52.708 --> 37:54.833
We've never actually worked with him.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.750
Oh, my mistake.

38:01.750 --> 38:05.125
Commercial vehicles, naturally.
We're looking for...

38:05.708 --> 38:08.041
Victor Desmaret.

38:08.125 --> 38:10.541
While working for the Prime Minister,

38:10.625 --> 38:13.416
I made some contacts
with my counterparts in the Gulf,

38:13.500 --> 38:15.083
mainly Qataris.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.166
Do you know Hamad?

38:17.791 --> 38:20.125
He was the former head of security.

38:21.875 --> 38:25.166
Who was then replaced
by Bachir El-Alamani.

38:26.250 --> 38:29.375
Sorry, I just wanted check
we were talking about the same guy.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.625
Bachir is an outstanding client.

38:33.083 --> 38:35.916
I'm renting him a converted Vito
and some cars next week.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.750
Incredible vehicles.

38:38.916 --> 38:40.958
He told me about them.

38:41.625 --> 38:44.750
I'd love to take a look for myself.

38:44.833 --> 38:47.083
Of course. Here it is.

38:47.166 --> 38:50.041
Bulletproof windows
that can withstand a .44 caliber.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.708
VR10 certified.

38:52.041 --> 38:53.875
And with 200 horsepower.

39:01.250 --> 39:03.125
It certainly looks robust.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.125
When is it available?

39:13.125 --> 39:15.916
-How do we stop the van?
-With construction equipment?

39:16.333 --> 39:18.583
No, it's not strong enough.

39:18.666 --> 39:20.666
We'd kill people on impact.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.208
-We shoot the tires.
-No.

39:22.291 --> 39:25.083
-Is it an armored van or not?
-A reinforced Mercedes.

39:25.166 --> 39:28.791
We're talking a security convoy.
Probably highly trained guys.

39:28.875 --> 39:31.333
They wouldn't open fire in their country

39:31.416 --> 39:34.083
but France isn't going to stone them
if they do here.

39:34.166 --> 39:38.583
After leaving the bank downtown,
it's 10 minutes to reach the ring road.

39:38.666 --> 39:42.375
The place will be crawling with cops.
We won't stand a chance.

39:42.458 --> 39:44.875
Too much traffic. Too many tourists.

39:45.333 --> 39:48.166
They'll continue on
from Maillot to La Chapelle.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.833
That's where we make our move.

39:53.125 --> 39:55.958
We block them and have an exit route.
And they're stuck.

39:56.041 --> 39:59.458
How do you block a ring road?
At the right time and the right place?

39:59.541 --> 40:01.208
-Easy.
-What's easy?

40:01.291 --> 40:03.875
I'll give you a clue. Wedding.

40:05.208 --> 40:06.958
Shit!

40:10.625 --> 40:12.916
-Don't you get it?
-No, we're dumb.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.750
Every weekend there are Arab weddings
with huge convoys.

40:16.041 --> 40:18.875
-We slip into the convoy.
-And divert it.

40:18.958 --> 40:21.375
That way, we control the traffic.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.875
Do you have guys who can do that?

40:34.666 --> 40:35.708
Got a girlfriend?

40:39.791 --> 40:42.541
-You don't give a shit.
-Or friends, whatever.

40:42.625 --> 40:44.958
-I do.
-No, you don't give a shit.

40:45.041 --> 40:47.375
We don't have to see each other, you know?

40:47.458 --> 40:50.208
I tell you everything about my life
and you stay silent.

40:50.291 --> 40:52.958
Are you in trouble?
We don't see each other.

40:53.041 --> 40:54.791
If I'm asking too much, we'll end it.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.083
We had a good time together at least.

40:57.166 --> 40:59.416
My stepfather is in court right now.

40:59.500 --> 41:02.291
He'll likely get a huge sentence
and die in prison.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.166
Spend the night with someone you know.

41:04.250 --> 41:07.000
I don't feel like talking about it,
it's too upsetting.

41:08.250 --> 41:10.000
Leave your phone there so it pings.

41:10.083 --> 41:12.875
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

41:13.958 --> 41:16.250
If things go to shit,
that'll be your alibi.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.500
-All good?
-Not yet.

41:18.583 --> 41:19.500
What?

41:19.583 --> 41:22.250
-We didn't pray yet.
-Are you serious?

41:22.333 --> 41:24.916
-Are you still superstitious?
-Of course.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.916
People are struggling
while we're hitting several million.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.916
It'll ward off the evil eye.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.750
Come on.

41:38.666 --> 41:41.000
Thank you, Lord, for bringing us together.

41:42.041 --> 41:43.666
Let everything run smoothly.

41:43.750 --> 41:46.125
Let no one get hurt, on either side.

41:46.791 --> 41:49.083
I know you must hate us,

41:49.166 --> 41:52.375
but understand we need to let loose
and make some money.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.333
Deliver us from bad luck and bastards.

41:55.416 --> 41:58.333
-And we'll take care of the rest.
-Amen.

41:58.416 --> 42:00.333
Let's do this.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.916
Are you okay?

42:08.541 --> 42:11.166
Malik, what's going on?

42:27.583 --> 42:28.958
There's movement.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.625
-They're getting out.
-Okay. Copy.

42:42.125 --> 42:43.416
Getting in the cars.

42:45.958 --> 42:47.750
Yalla.

42:57.750 --> 42:58.750
Let's go.

43:27.708 --> 43:29.375
Check this out. What do you think?

43:31.041 --> 43:33.166
An Ettore Sottsass sofa.

43:33.541 --> 43:36.041
A guy in Milan
will sell it to me for 20,000.

43:36.125 --> 43:38.666
Should I take it or not?

43:40.875 --> 43:42.958
It's not a huge margin to make

43:43.041 --> 43:47.583
but it'll look nice in the store
for a few weeks

43:47.666 --> 43:49.833
until we can find a buyer...

43:51.416 --> 43:52.666
Hello?

43:53.541 --> 43:56.416
I can't even breathe
and you're talking about a sofa.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.916
Who buys a sofa for 20,000 euros?

44:01.083 --> 44:04.375
People like you do.
No need to be so stingy.

44:05.583 --> 44:08.416
In half an hour,
you'll be a multi-millionaire.

44:11.000 --> 44:12.666
It is nice, right?

44:16.583 --> 44:18.750
They're exiting the town hall.

44:18.833 --> 44:20.125
I'm at the interchange.

44:20.208 --> 44:22.791
We'll be at the Asnières interchange
in 10 minutes.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.791
Okay, call your buddy.

44:33.875 --> 44:35.375
Okay, you were going.

44:35.458 --> 44:36.625
Okay.

44:39.875 --> 44:41.291
Let's get going.

44:50.041 --> 44:51.958
Let's go!

44:56.541 --> 44:58.458
Remember to honk!

45:02.041 --> 45:03.750
Honk!

45:48.416 --> 45:49.416
Are we all there?

45:49.500 --> 45:51.041
It's okay, I'm coming.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.791
Arriving at Asnières.

45:52.875 --> 45:55.291
Great. All good.

46:08.583 --> 46:10.791
Let's go, we're on the belt.

46:10.875 --> 46:13.333
Copy that. We're at the Auber interchange.

46:15.291 --> 46:17.166
Get closer. At the back.

46:42.041 --> 46:43.916
Okay, guys, we're on our way.

47:22.833 --> 47:24.541
Malik, we have a visual.

47:25.333 --> 47:29.916
Azzedine, keep the convoy moving.
They're behind me, almost at my level.

47:47.208 --> 47:48.250
Tunnel ahead.

47:48.333 --> 47:50.500
I'll slow them down.

47:50.583 --> 47:52.500
Okay. I see the tunnel.

48:11.208 --> 48:13.333
-Entering the tunnel.
-Okay.

48:27.041 --> 48:28.041
Let's go.

48:46.041 --> 48:47.125
Let's go.

48:55.625 --> 48:57.333
Malik is entering the tunnel.

49:44.541 --> 49:46.875
Step out. Step out!

49:47.291 --> 49:49.541
Hands on your head!

49:49.625 --> 49:52.583
Hands on the car!
Drop your weapon!

49:54.291 --> 49:55.750
Turn around. On your knees.

49:55.833 --> 49:57.125
Drop the gun.

49:57.916 --> 49:59.708
Drop the gun. Hands behind your back.

50:00.333 --> 50:01.625
On your knees.

50:07.125 --> 50:08.750
Don't move!

50:09.666 --> 50:12.458
Get out!

50:12.541 --> 50:14.208
Get out or I'll kill you!

50:14.291 --> 50:15.500
Get out!

50:15.583 --> 50:17.083
Get out!

50:19.083 --> 50:20.625
Move it!

50:20.708 --> 50:22.625
Get out! Come on, move it!

50:22.708 --> 50:25.625
Now!

50:32.500 --> 50:33.666
On the ground!

50:39.000 --> 50:40.791
Hurry!

50:50.333 --> 50:51.541
Stay there!

50:52.375 --> 50:53.750
Freeze!

51:17.333 --> 51:19.541
Don't look at me. Eyes to the floor!

51:29.041 --> 51:30.208
Move!

53:30.750 --> 53:31.791
Angel!

53:37.541 --> 53:39.083
Avi, no!

54:04.375 --> 54:06.375
He was with us, back then,

54:06.458 --> 54:09.083
when we robbed
the Brinks high-security vault.

54:10.125 --> 54:11.750
Chérif et Angel went down for it.

54:12.750 --> 54:13.791
He betrayed us

54:13.875 --> 54:16.625
and used a legal loophole in court.

54:17.333 --> 54:19.500
He sold us out to the Anti-Gang Brigade.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.958
He was a fucking snitch.

55:24.250 --> 55:26.333
-Come on. Get out.
-No.

55:28.458 --> 55:30.250
Come on, get out.

55:30.333 --> 55:32.708
We're not going to hurt you. Come help us.

55:34.750 --> 55:36.208
Come on!

55:37.875 --> 55:39.541
That wasn't the deal!

55:39.625 --> 55:42.708
If you have scores to settle,
you don't involve me!

55:42.791 --> 55:45.625
We'll all go down for your bullshit!

55:45.958 --> 55:47.666
I had nothing to do with that.

55:47.750 --> 55:50.916
I don't want to kill anyone.
It wasn't the deal.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.958
You're right. It wasn't.

55:54.458 --> 55:55.750
What are you doing to do?

55:56.875 --> 55:58.750
Here, take this.

56:17.625 --> 56:18.916
Catch.

56:28.583 --> 56:30.583
You're not ready for next week.

56:30.666 --> 56:32.583
We need to train you up.

56:32.666 --> 56:34.333
You were not ready
in the tunnel.

56:34.416 --> 56:36.083
Another mistake and we're done.

56:36.166 --> 56:39.166
It's my fault.
I should've made you practice more.

56:41.416 --> 56:43.958
I don't want to carry guns anymore. Okay?

56:45.916 --> 56:48.375
How are you going to open
the courthouse doors?

56:50.625 --> 56:52.250
With a magic wand?

56:55.083 --> 56:56.416
I don't want to kill anyone.

56:56.500 --> 56:58.291
Me neither.

56:58.750 --> 57:01.250
Did I blow that bodyguard's head off?

57:01.333 --> 57:04.000
No. I'm not that insane, buddy.

57:05.458 --> 57:07.000
But I will tell you this.

57:07.083 --> 57:09.583
If you don't know
how to use a gun properly,

57:09.666 --> 57:12.000
you'll end up panicking
and killing someone.

57:12.083 --> 57:15.625
If you keep up your Dalai Lama act,
we won't get anywhere.

57:15.750 --> 57:17.583
Or trust me
and we'll get your stepdad out.

57:17.666 --> 57:19.541
I don't trust you anymore.

57:19.625 --> 57:21.791
He doesn't trust us anymore.

57:28.333 --> 57:30.791
We're all in this together now.

57:30.875 --> 57:33.333
People who don't do what we do
will never understand.

57:42.916 --> 57:46.291
Okay, we have eight days
to get some rest and get ready.

57:59.916 --> 58:03.000
7 DAYS TO GO

58:03.625 --> 58:07.208
He's not strong enough to make it.

58:07.291 --> 58:12.083
I disagree. He's resourceful.
His idea to block the cars worked.

58:12.166 --> 58:14.875
He's not strong enough,
I'm telling you.

58:14.958 --> 58:17.333
He'll be fine.

58:18.291 --> 58:22.291
We'll get him ready.
I'll make him strong, you'll see.

58:22.375 --> 58:23.625
I'll take care of it.

58:23.916 --> 58:25.125
Here.

58:49.541 --> 58:51.333
Take your hand off the magazine.

58:53.333 --> 58:56.333
Keep both eyes open.
Focus on the front sight.

58:59.875 --> 59:01.250
Firm.

59:10.416 --> 59:12.125
All right. Let's get to work.

59:19.333 --> 59:22.166
-We'll start over.
-Shit!

59:22.250 --> 59:23.416
We'll start over.

59:37.500 --> 59:39.458
Motherfucker!

59:39.541 --> 59:42.125
Straight ahead. There.

59:50.250 --> 59:51.458
Let's go.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.208
-Jump!
-What?

01:00:14.416 --> 01:00:16.208
Are you serious? Avi!

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:32.375
-Calm down.
-It's so cold.

01:00:32.458 --> 01:00:33.916
Keep calm.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.500
Breathe deeply.

01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:05.041
Here are the commandos.

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:09.166
You guys ready for Ukraine?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.375
Leave him alone. It was good for his head.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.458
Doesn't bother me.

01:01:16.041 --> 01:01:18.208
Come eat.

01:01:35.125 --> 01:01:36.416
It's good.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.875
Tired?

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.666
When you've finished,
you'll do the dishes.

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:45.291
What?

01:01:46.583 --> 01:01:49.875
When Avi was your age, he did the dishes.

01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51.625
Isn't that right?

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:54.833
And before you were born, so did I,

01:01:54.916 --> 01:01:56.458
for men who are long dead now.

01:01:56.541 --> 01:01:58.416
It's tradition.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.625
Maybe you think it's dumb,
but that's the way it is.

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:07.000
Rules from those who came before us.
And here, we obey the rules.

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:11.458
So you'll do the dishes.

01:02:15.708 --> 01:02:18.791
6 DAYS TO GO

01:02:21.333 --> 01:02:24.583
Thank you for your testimony.
You may sit back down.

01:02:45.708 --> 01:02:47.583
Mr. Lamy, please.

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.041
You asked if you could address the court.

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.875
You have the floor.

01:02:58.125 --> 01:03:01.166
After all that's been said and done,

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:05.333
I don't intend to shirk
my responsibilities.

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:07.916
I was hired for a job that went wrong,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.250
but I've always been a professional

01:03:10.333 --> 01:03:14.541
by avoiding violence
and relying solely on intimidation.

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:17.583
I did slip up once to defend my family.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:21.458
Anyway,
I know that won't change the outcome.

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:23.708
I feel sorry

01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:26.125
for that policeman's family.

01:03:26.208 --> 01:03:29.041
I'm not a murderer. I didn't kill anyone.

01:03:30.166 --> 01:03:33.708
I'm not going to lie
and say that I'm a victim.

01:03:35.041 --> 01:03:38.958
But I won't give anyone away.
I never have and I'm not going start now.

01:03:41.541 --> 01:03:44.000
Before I finish,

01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:46.750
I would like to say sorry to my wife.

01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:51.166
I had a quiet life,
everything was in order.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:56.875
She waited 17 years for me
and I promised I'd never mess up again.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.458
And I clearly didn't keep my word.

01:03:59.541 --> 01:04:02.000
So I want to say that I'm sorry.

01:04:03.291 --> 01:04:06.375
More sorry for her than for myself.

01:04:06.458 --> 01:04:08.833
Thank you for letting my speak.

01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:25.958
Hello.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:40.458
ECOCLEAN
LAUNDRY

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:44.958
Hello. Your IDs please.

01:04:45.041 --> 01:04:46.500
Thank you.

01:05:21.333 --> 01:05:23.166
Do you know this guy?

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:26.166
-What?
-Do you know that guy?

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.250
What are you playing at, coming here?

01:05:31.333 --> 01:05:32.708
Are you serious?

01:05:32.791 --> 01:05:35.875
I haven't heard from you.
You left your phone. I was worried.

01:05:37.916 --> 01:05:40.000
You need to leave. Don't come back here.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.250
Don't do this. Not to me.

01:05:42.333 --> 01:05:45.125
Either tell me what's going on
or I'll be back everyday.

01:05:50.541 --> 01:05:53.458
Tonight I'll explain.
But right now you have to leave.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.083
So?

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.291
That place is a nightmare.

01:06:33.875 --> 01:06:36.875
There ought to be
three times as many of us, or more still.

01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:42.375
I have an idea for getting in,
but getting out is the tricky part.

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:44.708
The courthouse is beside
the old 36 building.

01:06:45.250 --> 01:06:48.708
-Isn't it empty now?
-Except for the Anti-Gang Brigade HQ.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:51.875
By the time we get out,

01:06:51.958 --> 01:06:54.333
we'll have the best cops in France
on our tail.

01:06:54.416 --> 01:06:56.833
-Along with the rest.
-Did it slip your mind?

01:06:58.541 --> 01:07:00.541
Tell me something I don't know.

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:02.000
I'm telling you,

01:07:02.083 --> 01:07:04.166
even if we manage to exit the building,

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.916
we'll be stuck on an island
crawling with cops.

01:07:09.166 --> 01:07:11.375
We need to find a solution.

01:07:11.666 --> 01:07:13.791
You used to be quicker off the mark.

01:07:15.875 --> 01:07:18.208
No, we used to be quicker off the mark.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.875
We got rusty, goddammit.

01:07:22.166 --> 01:07:24.625
-Have you thought about the Seine?
-What Seine?

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:27.875
The river, you fool.
Can't we get away by boat?

01:07:27.958 --> 01:07:32.208
Same problem. The Anti-Gang Brigade HQ
is right opposite.

01:07:32.291 --> 01:07:34.500
And then adding to that,
the River Brigade...

01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:38.750
By the time we get everyone out,
all units will be alerted.

01:07:38.833 --> 01:07:40.750
We're screwed either way.

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.583
What if they're not alerted?

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.333
There are no phones in the courtroom.

01:07:51.416 --> 01:07:53.166
Except for the magistrates.

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:55.666
-We'll use a signal jammer.
-Exactly.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:58.208
We'll wear masks.

01:07:58.291 --> 01:08:00.458
A third person secures the area.

01:08:00.541 --> 01:08:02.875
We'll control everyone, just like...

01:08:02.958 --> 01:08:04.333
A bank robbery.

01:08:04.416 --> 01:08:06.583
-There you go.
-A bank robbery.

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:12.708
Again.

01:08:12.791 --> 01:08:14.250
4 DAYS TO GO

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.707
You've got to go faster.

01:08:16.957 --> 01:08:17.957
Boom!

01:08:19.625 --> 01:08:20.832
Boom! Go on, aim.

01:08:20.916 --> 01:08:23.291
Lift your finger off the trigger.

01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:24.791
How do you feel?

01:08:26.207 --> 01:08:27.750
It's normal to be scared.

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:31.416
Imagine the worst-case scenario.
The worst thing that could happen.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.791
Accept it. That's what I do.

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:36.582
You know where you're going,
and you know what to do.

01:08:36.666 --> 01:08:39.041
Your advantage is that you have a plan.

01:08:39.541 --> 01:08:40.957
The others don't.

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:43.082
What I'm about to say
may sound strange.

01:08:43.166 --> 01:08:44.957
But don't forget to have fun.

01:08:45.041 --> 01:08:47.291
Enjoy this rush of adrenaline.

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:50.125
That kind of rush,
it only happens once in a lifetime.

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:54.791
Angel and I never did this
just for the cash.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:56.916
It was never just about the money.

01:08:58.707 --> 01:09:02.000
We wanted to belong to
this world of legends.

01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.791
Like tigers and hyenas. Invincible.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:11.707
So no one could ever bring us down.

01:09:13.541 --> 01:09:15.541
Were we ever wrong? Sure.

01:09:18.250 --> 01:09:21.375
Were the people we idolized
really bastards?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.500
Yes, most of them.

01:09:23.582 --> 01:09:26.707
But no more than those
in your school history books.

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:36.207
If we succeed, we'll go down in history.

01:10:20.250 --> 01:10:21.875
Yeah?

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:25.166
-Who are you?
-It doesn't matter.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:27.291
I saw you in court yesterday.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.333
I'm here to talk about Malik.

01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:32.041
What do you want?

01:10:32.125 --> 01:10:34.541
He's in big trouble.

01:10:34.625 --> 01:10:37.375
He's gonna need you.

01:10:41.958 --> 01:10:47.833
3 DAYS TO GO

01:10:50.541 --> 01:10:53.708
Hello, we spoke on the phone earlier.

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:57.708
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

01:10:57.791 --> 01:10:59.666
-Thanks for waiting.
-No worries.

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:03.583
As I said on the phone earlier,
a colleague is getting married soon.

01:11:03.666 --> 01:11:06.875
We'd like to surprise him
with something that'll blow him away.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:08.833
How about our most powerful boat?

01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:12.041
This one.

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:14.583
A fine specimen. How powerful?

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:16.916
You won't find faster on the Seine.

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.333
It's as fast as the police boats.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:23.041
We'll even give you a pilot.

01:11:23.125 --> 01:11:25.166
That's great.

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.291
What do you want?

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:02.750
You think I can't see your little scheme?

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:04.583
What scheme?

01:12:04.666 --> 01:12:07.750
You're talking to the kid.
What are you planning?

01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:10.166
-Why? Are you jealous?
-Yes, I am.

01:12:11.583 --> 01:12:13.500
I was never involved in your hold-up.

01:12:14.375 --> 01:12:17.000
But the feds dragged me into it
to be their fall guy.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000
For that lousy job of yours
where I didn't even make a dime.

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:23.750
Maybe, but you're here now.

01:12:23.833 --> 01:12:26.166
If you're up to something, I want in.

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:28.250
If not, I'll tell them it was your idea.

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:30.458
Who will they be more interested in?

01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.416
The ghetto kid or the new Jacques Mesrine?

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.458
Hey, big shot. Didn't miss us too much?

01:13:02.541 --> 01:13:05.708
-Whose place is this?
-Too many questions.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.500
INCOMING CALL
LAWYER

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:12.833
Hello?

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:14.291
-Hello?
-Yes.

01:13:14.375 --> 01:13:16.083
We've got a problem.

01:13:16.166 --> 01:13:18.291
The girl? I thought that was settled.

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:20.916
Yes, I talked to him,
but we have another problem.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:28.500
2 DAYS TO GO

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.125
Yes?

01:13:37.875 --> 01:13:41.083
This is the last time
you pull this stunt on us.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:44.125
We're all going to end up in jail
meeting like this.

01:13:44.958 --> 01:13:47.000
This is a non-smoking office.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.916
Don't worry, there's no microphone.
We have a team who checks every...

01:13:59.833 --> 01:14:01.958
So, what's the problem?

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:04.333
Karim Taïeb is the problem.

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.750
Blackmailing Chérif.
He wants in on the plan.

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:11.333
How did he find out?

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.708
I don't know, but he wants to escape too.

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:15.833
And? Or else what?

01:14:15.916 --> 01:14:17.416
He's threatening Chérif.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:19.083
That's not our problem.

01:14:19.916 --> 01:14:21.541
Just think about it.

01:14:21.625 --> 01:14:24.875
Chérif thinks it could be
a great opportunity.

01:14:26.416 --> 01:14:30.666
Of course, it's a great opportunity.
That's his specialty.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.250
That's his thing.

01:14:32.333 --> 01:14:34.916
The thing he comes up with
when he's in trouble.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.291
If they think
that you want to pull him out too,

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:39.583
maybe they'll check out his connections

01:14:39.666 --> 01:14:42.041
which would buy you some time.

01:14:42.125 --> 01:14:43.833
It's not such a crazy idea.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:48.000
We already have the cash.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.791
It's in a safe place.

01:14:49.875 --> 01:14:52.875
If we wanted to,
we could split tomorrow and forget Chérif.

01:14:52.958 --> 01:14:54.250
Okay?

01:14:54.333 --> 01:14:55.750
All right.

01:14:55.833 --> 01:14:58.583
But we will
because we're happy to help a friend.

01:14:58.666 --> 01:15:01.208
But no one is going to tell us
how to go about it.

01:15:01.291 --> 01:15:04.250
Tell Chérif to say okay to him
so the guy keeps quiet.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.916
But between you and me,
we're not taking him.

01:15:07.791 --> 01:15:09.375
Very well.

01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:13.833
We've also got something to ask of you.

01:15:13.916 --> 01:15:15.583
Go ahead.

01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:18.166
You're going to have to break an ankle.

01:15:18.583 --> 01:15:20.458
Meaning?

01:15:20.541 --> 01:15:23.166
The place is full of metal detectors.

01:15:23.250 --> 01:15:24.916
It's the only way to get weapons

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.583
into the courthouse.

01:15:27.333 --> 01:15:29.333
Crutches will do the job.

01:15:29.416 --> 01:15:30.833
No, they won't.

01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:35.458
We'll need a medical certificate,
X-rays, MRIs...

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:38.166
Something to verify when they check.

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:41.291
Shouldn't be too much damage.
But we can do the leg instead.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:43.791
It's okay. I'll stick with the ankle.

01:15:43.875 --> 01:15:46.250
Do you want me to do it now?

01:15:46.333 --> 01:15:48.708
I'll take care of it.

01:15:50.791 --> 01:15:53.541
Now you get to struggle for a change.

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:57.291
Spare me your comments.
You know nothing about my life.

01:15:57.375 --> 01:15:59.208
That's for sure.

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.375
It looks really hard.

01:16:03.583 --> 01:16:06.625
You have no idea where I grew up
or what it took

01:16:06.708 --> 01:16:09.375
to afford this office
and become the lawyer I am today.

01:16:09.458 --> 01:16:11.833
It was harder than planning heists.

01:16:11.916 --> 01:16:13.666
Ma'am...

01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:15.791
This is the first time I've seen you mad.

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.250
-I'm actually very calm.
-Good for you.

01:16:21.041 --> 01:16:24.000
-Can I count on you?
-I won't let you down.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.666
Can you say the same?

01:16:28.666 --> 01:16:31.291
What we have to do is a lot harder.

01:16:31.375 --> 01:16:33.625
Much harder than breaking a bone.

01:16:33.708 --> 01:16:36.625
I'd rather be in your shoes than mine.

01:16:41.666 --> 01:16:43.375
Of course.

01:16:47.375 --> 01:16:50.000
Put your ankle on ice for three hours,
take a spoon,

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.541
and gently tap the bone.

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:55.166
It should break on its own
and you won't feel anything.

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:03.291
1 DAY TO GO

01:17:08.625 --> 01:17:10.583
Big shot, check this out.

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:16.125
-What is that?
-A pump-action shotgun.

01:17:16.583 --> 01:17:18.958
You have two types of rounds.

01:17:19.041 --> 01:17:20.875
You choose them with the selector.

01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:22.333
Okay?

01:17:22.416 --> 01:17:26.416
On the left,
I've put in three black rubber pellets.

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.541
Because we'd rather not kill.

01:17:29.583 --> 01:17:32.583
Then a round of orange lead pellets.

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:36.791
A bit stronger, more of a punch.
You can fold a box of ammo 30 meters away.

01:17:36.875 --> 01:17:41.875
You can take guys down,
break bones and be in control.

01:17:41.958 --> 01:17:46.000
On the right, if it's like the States,
I got you some brenneke.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:49.125
But that's only if things go to shit.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:52.458
Understood?

01:17:52.541 --> 01:17:56.125
I need you to practice.
You need to master the selector.

01:17:56.208 --> 01:17:58.041
You've got to memorize the sequence.

01:17:58.125 --> 01:18:00.625
Like counting cards at the casino.

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:03.875
Black, black, black.
Orange, orange, orange, orange.

01:18:03.958 --> 01:18:07.250
Black, black, black.
Orange, orange, orange, orange.

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:09.583
Charger, check.

01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:12.958
Battery for the angle grinder, check.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:18.041
Signal jammer's here too.

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.333
Okay.

01:18:35.375 --> 01:18:37.250
Do you remember this?

01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:39.541
Remember what?

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:42.958
You don't remember? Come on!

01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:47.583
It was the first time
you took Chérif and me to the club.

01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:51.750
You don't even remember?
It was great.

01:18:51.833 --> 01:18:54.750
You had your BMW M3
and your fingerless gloves.

01:18:54.833 --> 01:18:57.708
Don't you remember?
You thought you were Ayrton Senna.

01:18:57.791 --> 01:18:59.916
We thought he was nuts.

01:19:00.041 --> 01:19:03.625
You were with that pretty girl.
What was her name?

01:19:03.708 --> 01:19:05.750
-The Spaniard.
-Turn that shit off.

01:19:05.833 --> 01:19:10.708
Come on, Angelito.
Where are you going? What's the matter?

01:19:10.791 --> 01:19:13.083
You got nothing for me?

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:14.750
El patrón!

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:17.375
Angelito, what's wrong? You shy?

01:19:17.458 --> 01:19:19.458
Where are you going?

01:19:19.541 --> 01:19:22.791
Won't you dance with me? Come on, buddy.

01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:24.875
Get me a bottle of Dom Pé!

01:19:24.958 --> 01:19:27.458
-El patrón.
-I don't like dancing.

01:19:27.541 --> 01:19:30.208
You want a bottle of William Lawson?

01:19:31.541 --> 01:19:34.166
The Pharaoh boys, the Triangle boys.

01:19:35.916 --> 01:19:38.041
You've brainwashed him.

01:19:38.125 --> 01:19:40.833
Look at him, he dances like an Arab!

01:19:40.916 --> 01:19:44.000
Let yourself go, buddy!

01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:50.333
My amigo. Come on.

01:19:51.791 --> 01:19:53.500
Go on, beat it!

01:19:53.583 --> 01:19:55.583
Come on, my latin lover.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:59.416
Don't have it in you anymore?
Come on, man, you. know the chorus.

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:01.291
Got nothing for me?

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:05.125
Tonight might be our last.
Maybe our last one ever.

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:08.500
Three, four! Touch in the night!

01:20:14.208 --> 01:20:16.333
D-DAY

01:20:55.291 --> 01:20:57.708
HOSPITALITY - COMMUNITY
DRY CLEANING - HYGIENE

01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:59.291
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:20:59.375 --> 01:21:01.041
Thank you.

01:21:04.416 --> 01:21:06.458
Stop where my colleague is.

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:47.375
Switch off the ignition, please.

01:21:47.458 --> 01:21:50.083
Load inspection.

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:33.833
Go ahead.

01:22:43.583 --> 01:22:46.333
Do you mind if I use the restroom?
I won't be long.

01:22:46.416 --> 01:22:47.458
-Sure.
-Thank you.

01:23:23.083 --> 01:23:25.375
ECOCLEAN LAUNDRY

01:23:29.791 --> 01:23:31.625
-Hello.
-Hello.

01:26:18.833 --> 01:26:20.166
Sir!

01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:27.833
You shouldn't be in this area.

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.333
Put the gun away.

01:26:30.333 --> 01:26:32.541
Step back. Towards the door.

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:34.791
To the door. Move it!

01:26:34.875 --> 01:26:37.250
-Go on.
-Don't open yet.

01:26:46.083 --> 01:26:47.875
NO SIGNAL

01:26:51.333 --> 01:26:52.666
Nobody move!

01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:55.083
Everyone, hands up!

01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:57.625
Put your guns down!

01:26:57.708 --> 01:27:01.125
If you even touch the door,
your colleague is dead.

01:27:01.208 --> 01:27:03.625
Hurry up, come on!

01:27:03.708 --> 01:27:06.250
If I see a single phone,
blood will be everywhere.

01:27:06.333 --> 01:27:08.208
-Drop your weapons.
-Release me!

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.833
Let's go.

01:27:09.916 --> 01:27:12.416
-Hurry.
-Keep your hands up.

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.208
Keep your hands up.

01:27:15.666 --> 01:27:19.083
All those wearing gowns,
magistrates, lawyers, everybody up!

01:27:19.166 --> 01:27:21.125
Move towards the middle.

01:27:21.208 --> 01:27:22.541
Don't touch your gun!

01:27:22.625 --> 01:27:24.500
Everyone get to the back.

01:27:24.583 --> 01:27:26.958
-Everyone up nice and slowly.
-Let's go.

01:27:27.041 --> 01:27:29.416
Hurry up! Come on!

01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.041
-Free me.
-Shut up!

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:38.000
Get to the back, now.

01:27:38.083 --> 01:27:39.166
Move!

01:28:11.083 --> 01:28:12.666
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.125
Switch off the ignition!

01:30:06.041 --> 01:30:07.875
Drop your weapons!

01:30:08.458 --> 01:30:10.625
You can't get out!

01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:18.708
Bounce!

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.166
So?

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:46.708
Fuck!

01:32:09.708 --> 01:32:11.416
Get inside!

01:32:44.208 --> 01:32:45.458
Get back!

01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:04.666
Are you out?

01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:06.375
-No.
-What have you got left?

01:33:06.458 --> 01:33:08.708
-Just Brennekes.
-Give me some.

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:11.041
-No!
-Got a better idea?

01:33:13.833 --> 01:33:16.875
-When you hear it, you run.
-Hear what?

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.666
Jump!

01:34:54.416 --> 01:34:56.333
Don't shoot, they're unarmed!

01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:40.250
You did it!

01:35:40.333 --> 01:35:42.625
Hell, yeah!

01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:37.541
Angel, Avi, what's going on?

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:39.791
Chill. It's over.

01:36:40.125 --> 01:36:42.166
We'll get him out of the country,
don't worry.

01:36:42.375 --> 01:36:44.791
If he stays, he'll get exposed
to see his family.

01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:47.541
That's not good for us.

01:36:47.625 --> 01:36:50.125
You're a good kid.

01:36:50.208 --> 01:36:52.125
Mission accomplished.

01:37:17.125 --> 01:37:19.416
Police!

01:37:19.500 --> 01:37:22.166
Freeze! Hands up!

01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:24.208
On the ground!

01:37:24.666 --> 01:37:27.750
You too, turn around.
Show me your hands.

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:46.541
Where were you yesterday?

01:37:46.625 --> 01:37:48.708
At my place with my girlfriend.

01:37:49.875 --> 01:37:53.458
The girl from this morning or another one?

01:37:53.541 --> 01:37:55.625
Her name is Estelle.

01:37:55.708 --> 01:37:58.125
My bad. So you're monogamous.

01:37:58.208 --> 01:37:59.583
I didn't know.

01:38:01.833 --> 01:38:03.916
Forgive me for being in love.

01:38:04.583 --> 01:38:06.333
Okay, fine.

01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:09.416
I hope your lawyer
has a better sense of humor than me.

01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:10.916
What lawyer?

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.000
Thanks.

01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:24.000
You can thank her.

01:38:24.083 --> 01:38:26.250
You went to see her.

01:38:27.041 --> 01:38:29.125
She wasn't easy to convince.

01:38:30.458 --> 01:38:32.541
What did you promise her?

01:38:32.625 --> 01:38:34.416
Half.

01:38:34.500 --> 01:38:37.375
Count yourself lucky,
I'd have asked for more.

01:39:03.125 --> 01:39:05.375
You made a real fool out of me.

01:39:08.708 --> 01:39:10.583
I was scared.

01:39:12.916 --> 01:39:15.458
I'm sorry about your stepfather.

01:39:18.833 --> 01:39:20.500
It's over now.

01:39:27.333 --> 01:39:31.541
Well rest up, think about it,
and if it really is over, call me.

01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:11.250
So?

01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:18.125
So, it looks like we're poor.

01:41:28.083 --> 01:41:30.458
Do you want to go to the beach anyway?

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.500
I was going to ask.

01:42:07.291 --> 01:42:09.166
You dead or what?

01:42:11.666 --> 01:42:14.750
Well, buddy,
aren't you going to introduce us?

01:42:20.291 --> 01:42:23.375
Avi, Angel. Estelle.

01:42:23.458 --> 01:42:26.250
-Hello, miss.
-Hi.

01:42:26.458 --> 01:42:28.333
They're...

01:42:29.916 --> 01:42:31.958
They're friends of mine.

01:42:32.458 --> 01:42:34.291
Good friends.

01:42:35.291 --> 01:42:37.125
Very good friends.

01:42:49.458 --> 01:42:51.291
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

01:42:55.875 --> 01:42:58.625
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

01:42:58.708 --> 01:43:00.333
Well?

01:43:00.416 --> 01:43:01.875
Well?

01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:06.000
