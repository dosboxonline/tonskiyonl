"We don't want the war to stop.
We're winning."

12:32.252 --> 12:33.629
That's his son.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.632
Haqqani: "We've been telling
ourselves that for 18 years,

12:36.715 --> 12:38.967
that we're winning,
we're winning,

12:39.051 --> 12:41.720

12:47.976 --> 12:49.853

of the Taliban talking

12:49.937 --> 12:52.064
right there in black and white,

12:52.147 --> 12:53.649
saying, "Enough of war."

12:54.650 --> 12:58.779
We've been saying peace
is possible like a mantra,

12:58.862 --> 13:01.031
but now we have this,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.200
and we know...

13:03.283 --> 13:06.078
it may actually be possible.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.792
Haqqani's not an obstacle.
He's ready.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.878
We don't need to beg Pakistan
to bring him to the table.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.089
He'll come on his own if we
approach him the right way.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.972
The Guantanamo prisoners
we got released

13:25.055 --> 13:28.934
to keep the Taliban delegation
from leaving...

13:29.017 --> 13:30.853
one of them
was Haqqani's cousin, right?

13:30.936 --> 13:32.437
Second cousin.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.276
And they're arriving tonight.

13:39.736 --> 13:40.737
MIKE:
What's this?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.364
CARRIE:
Car bomb.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.324
Happened
a year and a half ago.

13:44.408 --> 13:46.785
Young man blown to bits.
His wife watches it happen.

13:46.869 --> 13:49.454
Newlyweds.
It was all over the local news.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.498
The wife's name
was Samira Noori.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.125
She was part
of a corruption probe

13:53.208 --> 13:55.002
launched by our government.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.503
The investigation
took this turn

13:56.587 --> 13:58.130
toward our good friend
Abdul G'ulom...

13:58.213 --> 13:59.506
-Right, I remember.
-At which point,

13:59.590 --> 14:01.133
everyone working on it
was fired.

14:01.216 --> 14:03.302
The auditors
literally disappeared.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.597
No one would say what happened
except Samira.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.390
She calls out G'ulom publicly,

14:08.473 --> 14:09.975
demands the probe
be reopened.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.560
A few days later...
(imitates explosion)

14:11.643 --> 14:12.644
-Her husband dies.
-Yeah.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.190
But the bomb was
almost certainly meant for her.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.442
Well, how'd you get
onto her, anyway?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.320
Anonymous tip,
waiting for me when I got back

14:21.403 --> 14:22.446
from my meeting with G'ulom.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.906
Well, that's convenient.

14:23.989 --> 14:24.990
G'ulom's got a million enemies.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.074
It could've been any one
of them,

14:26.158 --> 14:27.409
someone in his office, even.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.744
It could be a setup.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.537
Look, I need leverage
on G'ulom.

14:30.621 --> 14:32.497
That's what Saul
brought me here to find,

14:32.581 --> 14:33.916
and right now,
I've got nothing.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.835
G'ulom basically laughed me
out of his office this morning,

14:36.919 --> 14:39.505
which is why I want
to stand up an operation...

14:39.588 --> 14:41.256
-Shit.
-For your approval.

14:42.883 --> 14:44.510
Samira hasn't managed
to find a job

14:44.593 --> 14:45.844
since her husband died.

14:45.928 --> 14:46.929
She's looking, though.

14:47.012 --> 14:50.474
Her résumé's online at three
recruiting sites here in Kabul.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.643
The idea is to bring her in
for a job interview--

14:52.726 --> 14:54.478
not here, obviously.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.396
So you want to talk to her.

14:56.480 --> 14:59.024
No, I want someone else to,
and while they're doing that,

14:59.107 --> 15:00.651
I want to take a look
through her apartment.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.110
She's a fighter.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.529
She lost her husband
over this.

15:03.612 --> 15:05.447
My bet is,
there'll be something there.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.409
(breathes deeply)

15:09.493 --> 15:11.078
Let Jenna Bragg
run the interview.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.914
She set up a phony NGO

15:13.997 --> 15:15.958
that would work perfectly
for this--

15:16.041 --> 15:17.584
medical clinics or something.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.378
Didn't you say she was stuck
in the starting gate?

38:16.046 --> 38:18.215
but it's at least 100 million.

38:18.298 --> 38:20.300
So what?

38:20.384 --> 38:22.219
So what?

38:22.302 --> 38:25.681
Everyone in government
has their nose in the trough.

38:25.764 --> 38:28.100
You think they will put me
in prison?

38:28.183 --> 38:31.019
They are terrified
I expose their secrets.

38:31.103 --> 38:32.604
Not this time.

38:32.688 --> 38:34.690
Really?

38:34.773 --> 38:36.483
You went against
government policy

38:36.567 --> 38:38.402
when you capsized
the peace process.

38:38.485 --> 38:41.154
You humiliated the president
and the parliament.

38:41.238 --> 38:43.615
So when they hear you've also
been creating fake army units,

38:43.699 --> 38:45.158
you're right--
they won't put you in prison.

38:45.242 --> 38:46.994
They'll put you
up against a wall.

38:49.371 --> 38:51.290
So here's the deal.

38:51.373 --> 38:53.542
The United States
will give you two hours.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.002
To do what?

38:55.085 --> 38:58.005
Walk back your statement
about the prisoner exchange.

38:58.088 --> 38:59.506
You will say you misspoke,

38:59.590 --> 39:01.675
that you fully support
the peace process,

39:01.758 --> 39:03.886
and you will do it publicly.

39:03.969 --> 39:06.763
You do that, and these...

39:06.847 --> 39:09.349
will be kept between us.

39:16.398 --> 39:18.901
This peace of yours...

39:18.984 --> 39:22.529
do you really think the Taliban
will keep any agreement?

39:22.613 --> 39:27.117
They wait till you draw down
your forces

39:27.201 --> 39:29.745
while they gather theirs
in the villages

39:29.828 --> 39:31.455
and in the mountains,

39:31.538 --> 39:35.334
and then it will be Saigon
all over again--

39:35.417 --> 39:37.753
your embassy under siege,

39:37.836 --> 39:40.631
helicopters taking off
from the roof,

39:40.714 --> 39:44.927
every fool who ever worked
for you massacred in the street.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.762
Then...

39:46.845 --> 39:49.848
who will you
come running to?

39:51.099 --> 39:55.729
Me, just as you did in 2001,

39:55.812 --> 39:58.815
because no one else

39:58.899 --> 40:02.319
has the balls to fight.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.031
Two hours.

40:06.114 --> 40:08.116
A public statement.

40:20.212 --> 40:22.422
Max for you.

40:22.506 --> 40:23.924
Max.

40:24.007 --> 40:25.551
I know you said
not to contact you

40:25.634 --> 40:29.137
unless it was important,
but I think this is important.

40:29.221 --> 40:30.556

40:38.105 --> 40:39.106

40:39.189 --> 40:40.858
