<i>Academically excelled in theoretical

<i>Graduated with distinction into

01:39.258 --> 01:42.928
<i>Quickly established an effectiveness

Use your brain.

01:44.889 --> 01:47.933
<i>Proceeded to improve skill base
with courses in advanced driving</i>

01:49.685 --> 01:51.979
<i>and advanced cycling.</i>

<i>And sustained three injuries
in the line of duty.</i>

02:20.340 --> 02:25.178
<i>Most recently in December when wounded
by a man dressed as Father Christmas.</i>

02:27.347 --> 02:30.016
- Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, Sergeant.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.603
- How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

02:34.145 --> 02:35.145
It can get awfully hairy out there.

02:35.896 --> 02:39.525
I'm surprised you weren't snapped up
sooner for a nice desk job. That's what I did.

02:39.608 --> 02:41.902
I prefer to think my office is
out on the street.

02:41.985 --> 02:43.529
Indeed, you do.

02:43.821 --> 02:48.283
Your arrest record is 400% higher
than any other officer.

02:48.367 --> 02:52.996
Which is why it's high time
that such skills were put to better use.

02:54.915 --> 02:57.334
- We're making you Sergeant.
- I see.

02:58.127 --> 02:59.920
In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

03:00.003 --> 03:02.673
- In where, sorry?
- In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

03:02.756 --> 03:05.843
- That's in the country.
- Yes, lovely.

03:06.677 --> 03:08.512
Isn't there a Sergeant's position
here in London?

03:08.595 --> 03:09.805
No.

03:09.888 --> 03:12.181
- Can I remain here as a PC?
- No.

03:12.265 --> 03:14.684
- Do I have any choice in this?
- No.

03:15.768 --> 03:17.520
Sergeant, I kind of like it here.

03:17.603 --> 03:19.731
Well, you've always wanted
to transfer to the country.

03:19.814 --> 03:22.525
- In 20 years or so, yes.
- Well done, you.

03:23.025 --> 03:24.736
Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.

03:24.819 --> 03:26.904
Yes, you did. You said,

03:26.988 --> 03:29.991
"I'd love to settle down
in the country sometime, Janine."

03:31.367 --> 03:33.036
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

03:33.119 --> 03:35.079
You can speak to the Inspector,
but I can promise you

03:35.163 --> 03:38.124
he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.296
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- It's still a bit stiff.

03:43.379 --> 03:45.798
- And how are things at home?
- I'm sorry, sir?

03:45.882 --> 03:47.382
How's Janine?

03:49.051 --> 03:50.844
We're no longer together, sir.

03:50.927 --> 03:53.847
- Right. Then where are you living?
- He's staying at the Section House, sir.

03:53.930 --> 03:56.892
- With the recruits?
- Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

03:56.975 --> 03:58.852
Well, then, you're packed already.

03:58.935 --> 04:01.897
Nicholas, we're offering you a smashing
position with a delightful cottage,

04:01.980 --> 04:05.400
in a lovely little place
that I think has won Village of the Year

04:05.484 --> 04:08.862
I don't know how many times.
It'll be good for you.

04:09.071 --> 04:12.532
- I don't really know what to say.
- Yes?

04:12.824 --> 04:14.409
Yes, thank you.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.789
No, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...

04:18.872 --> 04:21.791
- You want to take this higher?
- Yes, yes, I do.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.793
You want me to bother
the Chief Inspector with this?

04:23.876 --> 04:24.960
Yes.

04:25.044 --> 04:28.089
You want me to get the Chief Inspector
to come all the way down here?

04:28.172 --> 04:30.758
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

04:31.675 --> 04:32.885
Kenneth!

04:33.386 --> 04:36.722
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

04:37.098 --> 04:38.766
- Chief Inspector...
- Keep your seat.

04:38.849 --> 04:41.060
Now, I know what you're going to say,

04:41.143 --> 04:44.438
but the fact is,
you've been making us all look bad.

04:44.522 --> 04:45.606
I'm sorry, sir?

04:45.689 --> 04:47.149
Of course we all appreciate your efforts,

04:47.233 --> 04:49.819
but you've been rather
letting the side down.

04:49.902 --> 04:51.862
It's all about being a team player, Nicholas.

04:51.946 --> 04:53.948
You can't be the Sheriff of London.

04:54.031 --> 04:55.825
If we let you carry on running round town,

04:55.908 --> 04:59.744
you'll continue to be exceptional
and we can't have that.

04:59.828 --> 05:02.205
You'll put us all out of a job.

05:02.580 --> 05:04.290
With respect, sir.

05:04.374 --> 05:09.713
- You can't just make people disappear.
- Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.

05:10.422 --> 05:15.009
Well, however you spin this, there's
one thing you haven't taken into account.

05:15.135 --> 05:17.637
And that's what the "team"
is gonna make of this.

05:33.153 --> 05:35.154
<i>- Hello?
- Janine, it's me.</i>

05:35.237 --> 05:37.281
I know. I'm at work.

05:37.364 --> 05:39.283
<i>I know, I'm outside.</i>

05:41.076 --> 05:42.828
What's the situation?

05:42.911 --> 05:45.998
You know the situation.
We've been over this.

05:46.081 --> 05:47.499
No, I... I meant here.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.210
Two people involved,
distinct signs of a struggle.

05:50.294 --> 05:51.503
Complete mess.

05:51.587 --> 05:54.673
- You are talking about here?
- Nicholas, what do you want?

05:54.757 --> 05:58.927
Well, I have something important to tell you
and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.

06:01.096 --> 06:03.932
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

06:04.099 --> 06:05.184
I'm not Janine.

06:06.602 --> 06:09.146
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

06:09.229 --> 06:10.980
I know. Bob told me.

06:11.064 --> 06:12.231
Hello, there.

06:12.315 --> 06:14.400
Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

06:14.484 --> 06:16.611
And there's no reason
we can't be civil with each other.

06:16.694 --> 06:18.529
It's not that long ago
we were talking about getting married.

06:18.613 --> 06:21.532
Yes, but you were already married
to the force, weren't you?

06:21.616 --> 06:23.409
We're actually supposed to call it
"the service" now.

06:23.493 --> 06:26.204
Official vocab guidelines state
that "force" is too aggressive.

06:26.287 --> 06:28.081
See. It's only ever about the job.

06:28.164 --> 06:30.375
- It's all you care about.
- That's not true.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.378
No, you're right,
you do have that rubber plant.

06:33.461 --> 06:37.215
- It's a Japanese Peace Lily.
- You just can't switch off, Nicholas.

06:37.965 --> 06:43.137
And until you find a person you care
about more than your job, you never will.

06:44.055 --> 06:47.182
Besides, you were the one
who suggested we take a break.

06:47.265 --> 06:51.269
Yes, well,
guilty people often make the first move.

06:52.437 --> 06:54.481
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

06:54.564 --> 06:57.025
- You're seeing someone else.
- Yes. How did you...

06:57.109 --> 06:59.111
- Is it Bob?
- No.

06:59.194 --> 07:02.698
Does Bob look like
the kind of person I'd go out with?

07:02.781 --> 07:04.282
It's Dave.

07:04.366 --> 07:05.826
Hello, there.

07:06.743 --> 07:08.203
I see.

07:09.246 --> 07:10.747
Oh, Nicholas.

07:10.997 --> 07:13.625
You do realise that window
was broken from the inside?

07:21.508 --> 07:22.967
<i>Hello there, Nicholas,
Frank Butterman here, your new Inspector.</i>

07:23.050 --> 07:26.262
<i>I'm just calling with details
of your accommodation.</i>

07:26.345 --> 07:29.432
<i>We've got you a lovely little cottage
on Spencer Hill.</i>

07:30.015 --> 07:32.435
<i>Look forward to meeting you anon. Cheerio.</i>

07:33.602 --> 07:36.731
<i>Nicholas, Frank again.
One other thing about your cottage.</i>

07:37.064 --> 07:38.190
<i>It's not ready.</i>

08:19.689 --> 08:23.360
It would appear the heavens have opened.

08:30.450 --> 08:34.453
- I was hoping to check in.
- Check in?

08:34.953 --> 08:37.289
But you've always been here.

08:37.664 --> 08:41.626
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:41.710 --> 08:43.462
I thought you were my husband.

08:43.544 --> 08:46.256
- You must be Sergeant Angel.
- Yes, I am.

08:46.340 --> 08:49.635
I'm Joyce Cooper.
I trust you had a pleasant trip. Fascist.

08:50.135 --> 08:51.470
I beg your pardon?

08:51.553 --> 08:56.809
"System of Government characterised
by extreme dictatorship." Seven across.

08:57.267 --> 09:01.814
- Oh, I see. It's "fascism."
- Fascism. Wonderful.

09:02.064 --> 09:06.485
Now, we've put you in the Castle Suite.
Bernard will escort you up there.

09:07.820 --> 09:11.864
Well, actually,
I could probably make my own way up. Hag.

09:12.323 --> 09:14.117
I beg your pardon?

09:14.200 --> 09:17.995
"Evil old woman considered
frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.

09:18.246 --> 09:20.748
Oh, bless you.

10:06.251 --> 10:09.880
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
Right you are, my love.

10:10.380 --> 10:12.132
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

10:12.215 --> 10:17.137
Could I have a glass
of the cranberry juice, please?

10:17.220 --> 10:18.513
Certainly.

10:18.597 --> 10:22.058
Now, you wouldn't, by any chance,
be the new policeman?

10:22.141 --> 10:24.185
Police officer, yes. I'm Nicholas Angel.

10:24.268 --> 10:27.146
- I'm Roy Porter. This is my wife Mary.
- Mary.

10:27.688 --> 10:28.939
Welcome to Sandford.

10:29.023 --> 10:30.524
If there's anything you need,
just let us know.

10:30.608 --> 10:33.903
Thank you. Could I borrow your newspaper?

10:33.986 --> 10:35.237
It's not ours, love.

10:35.321 --> 10:37.907
We're not big fans of the local fish wrapper,
are we, Mare?

10:37.990 --> 10:41.577
- They listed her age as 55.
- When I'm actually 53.

10:41.660 --> 10:42.912
Fifty-three.

10:44.372 --> 10:47.708
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
- Right you are, my love.

11:20.573 --> 11:22.617
- Excuse me.
- What?

11:22.701 --> 11:25.120
- When's your birthday?
- Twenty-second of February.

11:25.203 --> 11:27.205
- What year?
- Every year.

11:27.288 --> 11:28.415
Get out.

11:29.582 --> 11:34.795
- When's your birthday?
- Eighth of May, 1969.

11:34.878 --> 11:36.672
- You're 37?
- Yeah.

11:36.755 --> 11:37.881
Get out.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.091
When's your birthday?

11:40.342 --> 11:41.468
Out.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.139
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Yes, there is, Mr Porter.

11:45.222 --> 11:48.017
It would appear a number
of your patrons are under age.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.811
Well, a few of them may be
a month or two south of proper.

11:50.894 --> 11:53.647
But if they're in here,
it stops them getting into trouble out there.

11:53.731 --> 11:55.983
Yeah, the way we see it,
it's all for the greater good.

11:56.066 --> 11:57.192
The greater good.

11:57.276 --> 12:01.572
Well, that's as may be,
but the law's the law and they'll have to go.

12:06.702 --> 12:09.663
- Another cranberry juice?
- I'm fine, thank you.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.103
I hope you're not planning on driving that.

12:34.312 --> 12:35.438
No.

12:51.286 --> 12:54.289
Right. I'm taking you to the station.

12:55.832 --> 12:57.209
Where is it?

13:04.007 --> 13:05.133
What?

13:15.727 --> 13:16.895
Move.

13:21.483 --> 13:23.693
"Nicholas Angel."

13:24.318 --> 13:27.321
- Oh, when did you start?
- Tomorrow.

13:27.780 --> 13:30.199
Well, I see you've already arrested
the whole village.

13:30.282 --> 13:31.450
Not exactly.

13:32.284 --> 13:35.204
- You in for the night?
- Go on, four's free.

13:35.287 --> 13:38.666
- Hey, now, I need to speak to him.
- He'll be no use till the morning.

13:38.749 --> 13:39.917
I see.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.003
You really want to process all this lot?

13:43.879 --> 13:46.424
- My pen's running out.
- Not a problem.

14:25.420 --> 14:27.172
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning.

14:27.255 --> 14:28.423
Morning.

14:29.466 --> 14:30.633
Morning, Sergeant.

14:32.719 --> 14:34.595
Morning, Sergeant.

14:39.641 --> 14:41.852
- Lock me up.
- I'm sorry?

14:41.935 --> 14:44.063
I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.

14:44.938 --> 14:48.609
- You're a what?
- A slasher of prices.

14:50.110 --> 14:54.907
<i>Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.
I run the local supermarché.</i>

14:55.157 --> 14:58.619
Drop in and see me sometime.
My discounts are criminal.

14:58.994 --> 15:00.621
Catch me later!

15:02.623 --> 15:04.917
Morning, Sergeant.

15:10.421 --> 15:12.548
Morning, Sergeant.

15:16.177 --> 15:19.389
Could you tell the Inspector
I've arrived, please?

15:19.681 --> 15:21.015
No.

15:21.599 --> 15:22.850
Why?

15:23.267 --> 15:25.269
He's not in yet.

15:25.561 --> 15:28.022
- Well, how's our guest?
- Guest?

15:28.106 --> 15:32.735
- The inebriate in cell four.
- I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.

15:38.199 --> 15:40.034
Can I get cell four open, please?

15:40.118 --> 15:42.203
Danny, can you open four?

15:44.747 --> 15:49.209
- He's gone.
- Oh, my God. Who's gone?

15:52.212 --> 15:56.383
- Why are you dressed like a police officer?
- Because I am one.

15:57.259 --> 15:59.678
Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.

16:00.846 --> 16:03.932
- I see you've already met my boy.
- Yes.

16:05.892 --> 16:09.187
Do forgive me.
I'm something of a Wild West nut.

16:09.271 --> 16:13.608
Speaking of which, that was a fair
few outlaws you rounded up last night.

16:13.775 --> 16:15.360
Thank you, sir.

16:15.444 --> 16:20.365
I admire your enthusiasm
and far be it from me to stifle your flair,

16:20.449 --> 16:23.159
but this isn't London.
Oh, yes, please, Danny.

16:23.242 --> 16:24.368
With respect, sir,

16:24.452 --> 16:27.705
geographical location shouldn't factor
in the application of the law.

16:27.788 --> 16:29.081
No, thanks.

16:29.165 --> 16:33.085
Statistically, Sandford is
the safest village in the country.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.379
But that doesn't mean
it requires anything less

16:35.463 --> 16:37.923
than a careful and considered approach.

16:38.007 --> 16:40.926
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

16:41.010 --> 16:44.513
- The greater good?
- The greater good. Precisely.

16:44.597 --> 16:48.893
Your predecessor assumed
that rural policing was easy.

16:49.727 --> 16:51.729
Ended up having a nervous breakdown.

16:51.812 --> 16:55.941
And Sergeant Popwell was
an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.735
And he had one thing you haven't got.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.738
- What's that, sir?
- A great big bushy beard.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.907
Come on, let's have a mosey around.

17:06.201 --> 17:07.577
Locker room.

17:08.953 --> 17:10.454
Riot room.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.125
Evidence room.

17:17.045 --> 17:21.132
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?

17:21.215 --> 17:25.053
Detective Sergeant Wainwright
and Detective Constable Cartwright.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.056
Don't get up.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.935
I expect you're wondering
why we call them the Andes.

17:32.018 --> 17:35.688
- They're both called Andrew?
- They said you were good.

17:35.771 --> 17:38.440
Also, because talking to them is
an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?

17:38.857 --> 17:40.859
- Fuck off!
- Thank you, Danny.

17:46.949 --> 17:50.035
And this is where it all happens.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.706
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.

17:53.789 --> 17:55.082
PC Bob Walker.

17:56.542 --> 17:57.876
And that is Saxon.

17:58.419 --> 18:02.631
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.800
- She's our only policewoman.
- She's not a policewoman.

18:04.883 --> 18:07.094
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.
- She's a police officer.

18:07.177 --> 18:08.637
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.805
Oh, I don't know.
Comes in handy every so often.

18:11.139 --> 18:14.642
I could've given you the tour.
I've been round the station a few times.

18:14.934 --> 18:16.436
And what's upstairs?

18:18.187 --> 18:20.773
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

18:20.857 --> 18:23.151
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

18:23.526 --> 18:26.946
Civilian liaison
with the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

18:27.030 --> 18:30.158
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

18:31.617 --> 18:36.914
From this command centre
I can see what the whole village is up to.

18:38.082 --> 18:41.544
I must say I was rather admiring
your handiwork last night.

18:41.627 --> 18:44.213
It's a pity you didn't do the same
to those bloody hoodies.

18:44.297 --> 18:46.923
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.426
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti
on the fountain.

18:49.509 --> 18:51.845
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.

18:51.928 --> 18:54.181
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.

18:54.264 --> 18:55.515
Which reminds me,

18:55.599 --> 18:58.935
our friend, The Living Statue,
was here on Saturday.

18:59.019 --> 19:04.066
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

19:04.149 --> 19:06.985
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns,

19:07.069 --> 19:11.323
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.
- We'll get right onto it, Tom.

19:13.617 --> 19:15.994
We like to let them think they run the place.

19:16.078 --> 19:17.829
Well, that's that.

19:17.913 --> 19:20.332
Unless there's anything
you're unclear about?

19:20.415 --> 19:23.626
Yes, sir.
Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?

19:23.709 --> 19:27.963
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.
As punishment for his little indiscretion.

19:28.047 --> 19:29.131
His...

19:29.215 --> 19:32.551
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence
can be called a "little indiscretion."

19:32.635 --> 19:35.805
No, the gateau is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

19:35.888 --> 19:39.850
Last night's incident will require
something rather more serious.

19:39.934 --> 19:42.228
- Good.
- Do you like ice-cream?

19:42.311 --> 19:44.063
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

19:44.146 --> 19:47.900
Let's just say that we won't be short
of Chunky Monkey for the next month.

19:48.567 --> 19:49.735
Dad.

19:49.819 --> 19:53.614
Now, since it's your first day
and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.

19:59.911 --> 20:04.541
So, what made you choose Sandford then,
Sergeant Angel?

20:04.624 --> 20:06.251
It wasn't actually my choice.

20:06.334 --> 20:10.505
Oh, right, right, wasn't your choice to come
down here and tell me how to do my job.

20:10.588 --> 20:11.798
Our jobs.

20:13.842 --> 20:14.926
Yeah.

20:15.885 --> 20:18.805
Look, I can assure you it wasn't
my intention to upset the apple cart.

20:18.888 --> 20:22.142
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,
don't we?

20:22.225 --> 20:25.061
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

20:25.145 --> 20:27.731
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

20:27.814 --> 20:29.983
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

20:31.276 --> 20:34.611
- You got a moustache.
- I know.

20:35.279 --> 20:38.449
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

20:38.532 --> 20:42.828
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.122
Not a member of the public anyhow.

20:47.207 --> 20:49.960
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

20:50.044 --> 20:51.462
Well, I have.

20:51.545 --> 20:54.131
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

20:55.799 --> 20:58.344
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

20:58.427 --> 21:00.346
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

21:00.429 --> 21:02.931
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

21:03.015 --> 21:04.266
Did you shoot anybody?

21:04.350 --> 21:07.686
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

21:08.228 --> 21:11.981
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

21:12.065 --> 21:13.149
Where'd he get that?

21:13.232 --> 21:16.444
You do know there are more guns
in the country than there are in the city?

21:16.527 --> 21:19.572
Everybody and their mums
is packing round here.

21:20.323 --> 21:22.367
- Like who?
- Farmers.

21:22.450 --> 21:24.952
- Who else?
- Farmers's mums.

21:29.248 --> 21:32.043
What's it like being stabbed?

21:32.669 --> 21:36.005
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

21:36.089 --> 21:38.466
What was the second most painful?

21:44.930 --> 21:45.972
You ever fired two guns
whilst jumping through the air?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.015
No.

21:47.057 --> 21:48.058
You ever fired one gun
whilst jumping through the air?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.101
No.

21:49.142 --> 21:50.143
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit?
- Yes, I have.

21:50.185 --> 21:51.186
You ever fired a gun
whilst in a high speed pursuit?

21:51.228 --> 21:52.979
No.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.776
<i>Annette,
that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.</i>

21:57.859 --> 21:59.528
<i>Get a look at his arse.</i>

22:00.195 --> 22:02.406
<i>- What about Lethal Weapon?
- No.</i>

22:02.489 --> 22:04.491
<i>- You've seen Die Hard, though?
- No.</i>

22:04.574 --> 22:06.201
<i>- Bad Boys II?
- No.</i>

22:06.284 --> 22:07.995
<i>You ain't seen Bad Boys II?</i>

22:11.999 --> 22:13.875
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.544
- Same again tomorrow?
- Yeah.

22:21.340 --> 22:24.593
Amanda Paver,
headmistress of Sandford Primary.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.095
How do you do, Sergeant?

22:26.178 --> 22:31.017
- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.102
Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

22:33.185 --> 22:35.062
This is Leslie Tiller,

22:35.354 --> 22:39.483
whose horticultural expertise
has helped put Sandford on the map.

22:39.734 --> 22:42.069
- She's ever so good.
- Oh, go on.

22:42.153 --> 22:44.572
This is James Reaper,
who owns Brannigan Farm.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.365
I hear you're quite the marksman.

22:46.449 --> 22:48.909
Perhaps you might like to join us
for a shoot one day.

22:48.993 --> 22:51.537
Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr Reaper.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.247
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

22:53.331 --> 22:55.082
You will be popular with the local birds.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.875
Birds.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.170
Nicholas, hello. Reverend Shooter.

23:00.628 --> 23:03.923
I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

23:04.007 --> 23:06.092
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.428
Oh, you're an atheist?

23:08.511 --> 23:09.971
No, I'm... I'm...

23:10.055 --> 23:13.099
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.810
- You're an agnostic?
- I think I have a cream for that.

23:17.979 --> 23:21.107
Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.

23:21.191 --> 23:24.110
Hopefully we won't see too much
of each other over the coming months.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.946
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

23:27.030 --> 23:31.618
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

23:34.078 --> 23:37.039
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

23:37.414 --> 23:40.834
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

23:41.168 --> 23:43.212
So, congratulations to her.

23:43.295 --> 23:45.589
- Tom?
- Thanks, Joyce.

23:46.173 --> 23:47.257
Now.

23:48.008 --> 23:52.971
I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

23:53.055 --> 23:57.393
It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

23:58.143 --> 24:03.273
I refer, of course,
to the extremely irritating Living Statue.

24:08.612 --> 24:11.948
<i>Police work
is as much about preventing crime</i>

24:12.031 --> 24:13.866
<i>as it is about fighting crime.</i>

24:13.950 --> 24:17.453
Most importantly,
it is about procedural correctness

24:17.537 --> 24:20.957
in the execution
of unquestionable moral authority.

24:22.083 --> 24:23.459
Any questions?

24:25.795 --> 24:27.046
Yes.

24:27.130 --> 24:29.841
Is it true that there is a place
in a man's head

24:29.924 --> 24:32.051
that if you shoot it, it will blow up?

24:35.972 --> 24:37.432
Hi, hi, Tim Messenger.

24:37.515 --> 24:39.809
<i>Can I get a quick shot
for the Sandford Citizen?</i>

24:39.892 --> 24:41.060
Okay.

24:41.144 --> 24:43.271
How about you put the teacher
in handcuffs?

24:43.354 --> 24:44.855
I don't think that gives off the right signals.

24:44.938 --> 24:46.815
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.

24:47.232 --> 24:49.317
- Give the little blonde kid your hat.
- I'd rather not.

24:49.693 --> 24:51.695
- Wave your hitting stick about.
- No.

24:51.778 --> 24:53.030
Righty-ho-ho.

24:57.534 --> 25:00.537
Oh, can I have your autograph, please?

25:02.539 --> 25:05.584
- For the breakfast.
- Oh, sorry.

25:10.547 --> 25:12.716
Hey, that weren't me.

25:13.967 --> 25:16.553
- Morning, Angle.
- Good morning, Angle.

25:17.054 --> 25:18.889
- Morning, Angle.
- Morning, Angle.

25:18.972 --> 25:21.474
<i>- Sergeant Angel.
- Morning. The swan's escaped.</i>

25:21.557 --> 25:23.017
<i>- The swan's escaped?
- Yeah.</i>

25:23.100 --> 25:25.311
Right. And where has the swan
escaped from exactly?

25:25.394 --> 25:27.313
<i>- The castle.
- Oh, yeah? And who might you be?</i>

25:27.396 --> 25:30.733
<i>Mr Staker. Yeah, Mr Peter lan Staker.</i>

25:30.816 --> 25:33.903
P. I. Staker. Right. Piss taker. Come on!

25:34.070 --> 25:37.907
Yes, Mr Staker. We'll do everything we can.
Can you describe it to me?

25:37.990 --> 25:39.867
It's about two foot tall.

25:39.950 --> 25:42.411
- Long slender neck.
- Yeah.

25:42.495 --> 25:45.373
- Kind of orange and black bill.
- Anything else?

25:46.415 --> 25:47.875
Well, it's a swan.

25:55.841 --> 25:57.175
That's just gonna scare it.

26:02.555 --> 26:07.352
- No luck catching them swans then?
- It's just the one swan, actually.

26:10.105 --> 26:13.733
- Want anything from the shop?
- You've just been to the shop.

26:14.317 --> 26:15.860
I was thinking of a different shop.

26:15.944 --> 26:18.530
Constable Butterman,
this is not the time for personal errands.

26:18.613 --> 26:22.242
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?
- There is always something going on.

26:22.325 --> 26:26.246
You have to look closer, all right?
What about this guy?

26:26.997 --> 26:28.289
- Mr Treacher?
- Yeah.

26:28.373 --> 26:30.458
Why has he got that big coat on?

26:30.542 --> 26:34.378
He can't be cold. Why the extra layer?
Maybe he's trying to hide something.

26:34.962 --> 26:36.422
Mr Treacher?

26:37.381 --> 26:38.716
Okay. What about this guy?

26:38.799 --> 26:41.260
Ask yourself, why has he got his hat
pulled down like that?

26:41.343 --> 26:44.638
- He's fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want you to see his face.

26:44.722 --> 26:46.765
Because he's fuck ugly.

26:47.182 --> 26:48.934
Okay, what's his story?

26:49.018 --> 26:50.477
- Oh, that's Lurch.
- Go on.

26:50.561 --> 26:52.855
- He's a trolley boy at the local supermarket.
- Good.

26:52.938 --> 26:54.773
Real name, Michael Armstrong.

26:54.857 --> 26:57.067
- Dad says he's got a child's mind.
- Okay.

26:57.151 --> 26:59.278
And lives up Summer Street
with his mum and his sister.

26:59.361 --> 27:00.612
And are they as big as he is?

27:00.696 --> 27:03.324
- Who?
- The mum and the sister.

27:03.407 --> 27:04.908
Same person.

27:06.285 --> 27:07.661
What shop were you thinking of?

27:29.640 --> 27:33.144
<i>Sergeant Angel to the Manager's office.</i>

27:33.227 --> 27:36.314
<i>Manager's office. Sergeant Angel.</i>

27:39.025 --> 27:43.196
Sergeant Angel. Or is it Angle?

27:44.905 --> 27:47.949
Mr Skinner, a baby's sicked up in aisle six.

27:48.825 --> 27:51.411
Please excuse me. Michael!

27:51.495 --> 27:52.663
Yarp.

27:52.746 --> 27:56.208
- Child vomit. Aisle six. Mop it up.
- Yarp.

27:56.291 --> 27:59.503
- Mr Skinner, is there a problem?
- No, no, no, no.

27:59.586 --> 28:03.840
I simply wanted to say how lovely it is
to see you supporting your local store.

28:03.924 --> 28:05.175
Well, that's quite all right.

28:05.258 --> 28:09.513
All too many have defected
to the big Megamart in Buford Abbey.

28:09.596 --> 28:14.059
May their heads be struck
from their shoulders for such disloyalty.

28:14.142 --> 28:17.187
Yes, well, I am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

28:17.270 --> 28:20.773
Of course. I simply spied you loitering
in organic produce

28:20.856 --> 28:23.484
and assumed you had time on your hands.

28:26.946 --> 28:29.365
Well, maybe I'm not the one
you should be keeping an eye on.

28:29.824 --> 28:32.702
That's the Fridge Magnate.
His name's George Merchant.

28:32.785 --> 28:37.039
Made a fortune in kitchen goods.
Built that monstrosity on Norris Avenue.

28:37.832 --> 28:40.251
Actually, I wasn't talking about him.

28:40.960 --> 28:43.713
I was talking about him.

28:44.797 --> 28:46.257
Excuse me.

28:52.013 --> 28:53.055
Excuse me.

29:02.981 --> 29:06.067
"Meet the cop that can't be stopped."

29:23.084 --> 29:24.377
Tosser!

29:26.421 --> 29:27.964
Trouble in the high street.

29:28.048 --> 29:29.716
<i>Sergeant Angel's having a spot of bother.</i>

29:29.799 --> 29:31.009
Roger that.

29:41.393 --> 29:42.686
Morning, Sergeant.

29:50.027 --> 29:51.278
You mothers.

29:55.115 --> 29:59.787
- Let's cut through here. Head him off.
- Through the gardens?

29:59.870 --> 30:02.498
What's the matter, Danny?
You never taken a shortcut before.

30:46.748 --> 30:48.500
Hey, give me that!

30:55.007 --> 30:57.009
"You do not have to say anything,
however it may harm your defence

30:57.092 --> 30:59.803
"if you fail to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

30:59.886 --> 31:01.972
"Anything you do say
can be given in evidence."

31:02.055 --> 31:03.724
- Hi, Danny.
- All right, Pete?

31:03.807 --> 31:04.933
Do you know this man?

31:05.017 --> 31:06.727
Yeah, he's Auntie Jackie's
sister's brother's boy.

31:06.810 --> 31:08.687
And it didn't occur to you
to mention this before?

31:08.770 --> 31:11.606
Couldn't see his face, could I?
I'm not made of eyes.

31:22.199 --> 31:24.035
Impressive collar.

31:24.118 --> 31:26.662
Shame Mr Skinner
doesn't want to press charges.

31:26.746 --> 31:28.205
What do you mean,
he doesn't wanna press charges?

31:28.289 --> 31:32.126
I'm simply suggesting that, you know,
Peter be given a second chance

31:32.209 --> 31:35.171
before he becomes
just another crime statistic.

31:35.254 --> 31:38.090
I'm sure he's going to learn
a valuable lesson.

31:38.174 --> 31:41.886
- Stealing biscuits is wrong?
- Correct.

31:41.969 --> 31:43.054
Thanks.

31:43.137 --> 31:46.015
And yet we respond by not taking
a single punitive measure?

31:46.098 --> 31:49.060
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

31:49.143 --> 31:51.062
Like the biscuits, isn't it?

31:51.145 --> 31:54.023
- Mr Skinner...
- Is everything all right?

31:54.148 --> 31:59.152
Well, sir, Mr Skinner feels it would
be better not to prosecute an individual

31:59.235 --> 32:01.321
that has committed a blatant offence.

32:01.404 --> 32:02.864
Leave this with me.

32:02.947 --> 32:06.117
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

32:06.201 --> 32:08.078
<i>Oh, no!</i>

32:10.914 --> 32:12.415
Twenty-seven.

32:12.499 --> 32:16.044
<i>Have you ever seen Point Break?
- No.</i>

32:16.127 --> 32:18.463
<i>Amazing bit in Point Break
where they jump over fences.</i>

32:18.546 --> 32:20.465
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

32:20.548 --> 32:23.510
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank
and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

32:23.593 --> 32:26.513
through people's gardens,
and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

32:26.596 --> 32:27.764
'cause he loves him so much,

32:27.847 --> 32:30.016
and he's firing his gun up in the air,
he's like...

32:30.100 --> 32:31.518
Forty.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.394
Have you ever fired your gun up
in the air and gone...

32:33.477 --> 32:36.814
No, I have not ever fired my gun
up in the air and gone...

32:36.897 --> 32:38.357
Thirty.

32:38.440 --> 32:42.152
Sorry, I... I just...
I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.

32:42.236 --> 32:45.239
- I wanna do what you do.
- You do, do what I do.

32:45.322 --> 32:47.116
What on earth
do you think you're missing out on?

32:47.199 --> 32:50.661
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.

32:50.744 --> 32:54.164
Police work is not about
proper action or shit.

32:54.957 --> 32:56.375
Twenty-nine.

32:56.458 --> 32:57.793
If you had paid attention to me in school,

32:57.876 --> 33:01.046
you'd understand that it's not all about
gun fights and car chases.

33:02.506 --> 33:03.799
Fire up the roof.

33:08.428 --> 33:10.138
That was brilliant.

33:12.849 --> 33:15.351
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?

33:15.852 --> 33:17.937
Yes, you were, Mr Blower.

33:18.021 --> 33:21.274
Well, now, you see,
we are staging a homage

33:21.357 --> 33:25.445
<i>to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.</i>

33:25.528 --> 33:28.573
I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.

33:28.781 --> 33:30.450
Romeo not Juliet.

33:32.785 --> 33:35.538
- What are you writing?
- Everything you're saying.

33:35.621 --> 33:37.040
I might need to refer to it later.

33:37.123 --> 33:41.210
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor
so there's no need to...

33:41.419 --> 33:42.837
Just stop writing, will you?

33:42.920 --> 33:48.133
Look, I'm merely trying to explain
why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

33:48.216 --> 33:51.011
You're playing the male lead
in a homage to William Shakespeare's

33:51.094 --> 33:54.014
<i>Romeo and Juliet
and you're late for the dress rehearsal.</i>

33:54.097 --> 33:56.975
You think this is sufficient reason
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

33:57.059 --> 33:58.894
- Well, I...
- To flout speed limits

33:58.977 --> 34:03.023
- specifically put in place to save lives.
- Just, look, this is preposterous.

34:03.106 --> 34:06.902
- "Preposterous."
- Look, just stop writing!

34:06.985 --> 34:09.154
"Stop writing."

34:10.864 --> 34:14.909
Look, you're right, I apologise.

34:16.328 --> 34:18.664
- See what I did there?
- You hypnotised him.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.164
No, I used this.

34:20.246 --> 34:22.750
This is the most important piece
of equipment you will ever own.

34:22.833 --> 34:25.710
This notebook has saved my skin
more times than I care to mention.

34:25.795 --> 34:27.338
You should think
about using yours more often.

34:27.420 --> 34:29.422
- I do use mine.
- Show me.

34:34.844 --> 34:37.974
- That's just extraordinary.
- You should see the one on the other side.

34:44.021 --> 34:47.024
- What are you up to tonight?
- I have to water my Peace Lily.

34:47.108 --> 34:48.650
Thought you might wanna do something.

34:48.734 --> 34:51.862
- What exactly were you thinking?
- Don't know. Pub?

34:52.029 --> 34:55.199
I don't think that's a good idea. Do you?

34:58.201 --> 34:59.703
You two.

34:59.869 --> 35:04.249
<i>A Mr Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.</i>

35:04.332 --> 35:05.709
Said it was by way of an apology.

35:05.792 --> 35:07.335
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

35:07.752 --> 35:11.798
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody
we've officially rebuked. So...

35:12.257 --> 35:13.466
Yeah.

35:14.801 --> 35:16.386
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

35:16.469 --> 35:20.223
Wondered if you wouldn't mind
representing us at the am drams tonight.

35:20.307 --> 35:23.226
- Yes, sir, of course.
- And there's a spare for Danny, too.

35:23.310 --> 35:26.730
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.

35:33.319 --> 35:34.361
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

35:34.403 --> 35:37.114
Here's to my love.

35:43.996 --> 35:45.164
Now.

35:49.960 --> 35:53.505
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

35:54.423 --> 35:57.509
Happily some poison
doth yet hang on them.

36:05.184 --> 36:06.352
Bang!

36:25.203 --> 36:28.456
<i>Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.</i>

36:29.123 --> 36:30.416
It was very enjoyable.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.752
- "Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers"?
- I don't think so.

36:32.835 --> 36:34.462
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up
To Teen Suicide"?

36:34.545 --> 36:36.130
That's just grossly inappropriate.

36:36.798 --> 36:40.218
You will try and spell his name
correctly this time, won't you, Timothy?

36:40.301 --> 36:42.762
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?

36:43.054 --> 36:47.140
And annoyingly, the understudies
are actually professional actors.

36:47.307 --> 36:49.768
<i>Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs</i>

36:49.851 --> 36:51.728
<i>and Sheree portrayed a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.</i>

36:51.812 --> 36:53.981
Sergeant Angel, you came?

36:54.064 --> 36:57.442
So thrilled you accepted my invitation.

36:57.526 --> 37:00.487
Well, our Inspector
requested we attend. So...

37:00.570 --> 37:05.367
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from
someone we've officially rebuked so...

37:05.450 --> 37:06.785
Jog on.

37:07.452 --> 37:10.664
Congratulations to you and to Mrs Blower.

37:12.916 --> 37:17.713
Oh, this is not my wife.
This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.

37:18.005 --> 37:22.508
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.

37:22.591 --> 37:25.553
- I am not.
- Nonsense.

37:25.636 --> 37:31.350
I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts
of secrets would come tumbling out.

37:33.519 --> 37:37.815
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?

37:37.898 --> 37:39.775
Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

37:39.859 --> 37:41.986
A pleasure, my liege.

37:42.069 --> 37:45.489
- Eve's nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

37:45.573 --> 37:48.993
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.

37:49.785 --> 37:51.746
She clearly has a thing for older men.

37:52.872 --> 37:55.166
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

37:55.665 --> 37:58.335
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, Constable,

37:58.418 --> 38:01.171
their kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

38:01.254 --> 38:02.922
Hey, now you come to mention it,

38:03.006 --> 38:05.634
I too have reason to believe
she favours the older gent.

38:05.717 --> 38:06.843
Really? How so?

38:06.926 --> 38:10.013
Marcus Carter's big brother said
he'd fingered her up the duck pond.

38:13.516 --> 38:15.185
Oh, Officers.

38:15.268 --> 38:18.897
Again let me extend
my sincere apologies for earlier.

38:18.980 --> 38:22.359
That's quite all right, Mr Blower. Drive safe.

38:27.572 --> 38:30.742
"Drive safe." Oh, my God.

38:30.825 --> 38:33.202
You know that's the bloke
we done for speeding earlier.

38:33.285 --> 38:36.205
Yeah. Hopefully,
that's the last we'll see of him.

38:48.550 --> 38:49.885
Who is it?

38:54.473 --> 38:55.599
We haven't got long.

38:57.559 --> 38:58.769
To us.

39:00.980 --> 39:02.231
Who is it?

39:14.117 --> 39:15.451
Yeah?

39:18.329 --> 39:20.164
<i>...decaffeinated?
- Decaffeinated?</i>

39:24.752 --> 39:27.839
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

39:28.631 --> 39:31.467
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

39:31.926 --> 39:35.847
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.975
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

39:39.058 --> 39:45.605
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

39:47.274 --> 39:51.611
So, what do we reckon?

39:52.404 --> 39:53.864
Sergeant Angel?

39:54.448 --> 39:57.284
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

39:57.367 --> 39:59.077
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

39:59.161 --> 40:02.497
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

40:03.040 --> 40:04.374
Very good.

40:05.042 --> 40:06.126
What he said.

40:11.506 --> 40:13.634
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

40:13.717 --> 40:15.469
Nasty way to go.

40:16.303 --> 40:18.305
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

40:18.388 --> 40:21.474
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

40:21.557 --> 40:22.642
Right.

40:22.725 --> 40:28.856
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

40:29.148 --> 40:32.818
- Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

40:32.902 --> 40:34.487
Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

40:34.570 --> 40:36.781
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

40:36.864 --> 40:40.326
You know how it is. News travels fast.

40:40.534 --> 40:44.664
<i>A love struck Romeo
sings a streetsus serenade</i>

40:45.289 --> 40:47.667
- What happened, Danny?
- Traffic collision.

40:48.918 --> 40:50.836
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

40:50.920 --> 40:53.381
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

40:54.882 --> 40:56.299
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

40:56.383 --> 41:00.136
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in
a small town, fuck off up the model village.

41:00.220 --> 41:02.639
I'm just saying,
things aren't always as simple as they look.

41:02.722 --> 41:04.557
Most times they are.

41:04.641 --> 41:07.394
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher
comes back with something,

41:07.477 --> 41:10.063
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

41:10.146 --> 41:13.274
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

41:13.358 --> 41:16.236
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

41:16.319 --> 41:17.862
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

41:17.946 --> 41:20.740
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

41:20.824 --> 41:22.158
Please, don't be childish.

41:22.242 --> 41:23.535
At least consider interviewing the widow.

41:23.618 --> 41:25.704
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

41:25.787 --> 41:29.207
Oh, and how did you establish that?

41:29.291 --> 41:32.042
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

41:32.126 --> 41:34.545
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

41:34.628 --> 41:36.714
All right, pipe down, big one.

41:36.797 --> 41:39.341
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

41:39.425 --> 41:41.844
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

41:41.927 --> 41:43.762
There were no skid marks at the scene.

41:43.846 --> 41:46.807
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

41:46.890 --> 41:48.809
and not think to apply the brakes?

41:49.435 --> 41:50.728
If there were no skid marks it follows

41:50.811 --> 41:54.732
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

41:54.815 --> 41:56.817
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

41:56.900 --> 41:58.068
Yeah.

41:58.152 --> 42:01.238
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

42:01.322 --> 42:04.533
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

42:04.616 --> 42:08.119
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

42:08.202 --> 42:09.912
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

42:10.913 --> 42:12.040
Yes, sir.

42:18.004 --> 42:21.341
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

42:29.098 --> 42:30.183
Right.

42:30.266 --> 42:31.392
What did he say?

42:37.273 --> 42:38.941
- What did he say?
- He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

42:39.025 --> 42:40.610
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

42:40.693 --> 42:42.111
"What's Reaper moaning about?"

42:42.195 --> 42:43.278
Right.

42:43.362 --> 42:44.696
Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr Webley,

42:44.780 --> 42:47.950
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

42:49.993 --> 42:51.328
"Yes, I suppose."

42:51.411 --> 42:52.537
Thank you.

42:53.288 --> 42:54.790
All right.

42:56.458 --> 42:59.294
Mr Webley,
I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

43:01.672 --> 43:03.256
He does for this one.

43:05.008 --> 43:06.468
What do you mean by "this one"?

43:20.064 --> 43:22.733
By the power of Grey Skull.

43:22.817 --> 43:24.777
Where on earth did you get these?

43:24.860 --> 43:26.779
- Found them.
- He found them!

43:26.862 --> 43:30.449
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

43:30.533 --> 43:32.076
Sea mine.

43:32.326 --> 43:34.870
Well, Mr Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

43:34.954 --> 43:36.455
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

43:36.539 --> 43:38.541
No, it's just a lot of junk.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.805
Move, move, move!

44:13.783 --> 44:16.661
<i>- You what?
- No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.</i>

44:16.745 --> 44:18.830
That's right, deactivated!

44:18.913 --> 44:20.832
- It's not live.
- It looks live.

44:20.915 --> 44:22.000
<i>All right.</i>

44:45.022 --> 44:47.358
That was quite an impressive haul today,
Constable Butterman.

44:47.441 --> 44:50.861
Well, you know, I mean, maybe
we should do something to celebrate.

44:50.945 --> 44:52.363
Unless you gotta water your Peace Lily.

44:52.446 --> 44:55.866
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I don't know. Pub?

45:01.538 --> 45:03.165
Right you are, my love.

45:03.248 --> 45:05.334
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

45:05.417 --> 45:07.001
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

45:07.085 --> 45:08.711
And what can I get you
that isn't a cranberry juice?

45:08.795 --> 45:11.422
- I don't really wanna get drunk.
- You can get a little drunk.

45:11.506 --> 45:14.217
- Okay, I'll have one.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

45:14.550 --> 45:16.552
Mr Porter, what's your wine selection?

45:16.636 --> 45:21.265
Oh, we got red or white.

45:22.475 --> 45:25.645
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

45:30.692 --> 45:34.988
- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

45:35.071 --> 45:39.575
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

45:39.659 --> 45:45.622
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

45:46.415 --> 45:47.582
Is it?

45:47.666 --> 45:50.127
- No, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

45:52.671 --> 45:55.924
- You don't switch off, do you?
- You sound like my ex.

45:56.550 --> 46:00.095
- Well, you are always thinking away.
- It's what I do.

46:00.178 --> 46:03.598
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
- Really?

46:03.682 --> 46:06.310
I mean,
what made you wanna be a policeman?

46:06.393 --> 46:07.477
Officer.

46:07.561 --> 46:10.147
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

46:12.691 --> 46:16.111
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

46:16.194 --> 46:19.947
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

46:20.948 --> 46:24.952
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

46:25.036 --> 46:27.955
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

46:28.039 --> 46:30.166
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

46:30.249 --> 46:33.628
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

46:33.711 --> 46:36.797
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

46:36.881 --> 46:38.799
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

46:38.883 --> 46:39.967
He sounds like a good bloke.

46:40.051 --> 46:42.386
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

46:42.470 --> 46:43.596
What a cunt.

46:43.679 --> 46:46.098
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

46:46.182 --> 46:49.477
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.604
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

46:51.687 --> 46:53.689
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

46:53.773 --> 46:56.399
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

46:56.483 --> 46:58.860
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

46:58.944 --> 47:02.572
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

47:03.198 --> 47:05.200
- Shame.
- How so?

47:05.283 --> 47:07.827
I think you would've made a great muppet.

47:11.456 --> 47:14.334
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

47:14.709 --> 47:17.837
I don't know. Dad does it.

47:17.921 --> 47:22.092
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

47:22.175 --> 47:26.179
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

47:26.972 --> 47:28.348
I'm sorry.

47:29.516 --> 47:31.725
Never mind. Hey, watch this.

47:33.060 --> 47:35.479
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my eye!

47:37.147 --> 47:38.315
Ta-da!

47:38.399 --> 47:40.234
Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.

47:52.579 --> 47:55.374
- 777.
- Mr Skinner.

47:55.457 --> 47:58.043
- You know George Merchant, don't you?
- Evening, Officer.

47:58.127 --> 48:01.046
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

48:01.130 --> 48:04.550
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

48:04.633 --> 48:06.176
Such a loss.

48:06.260 --> 48:08.720
What say we drink to their demise?

48:08.803 --> 48:10.346
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?

48:10.430 --> 48:12.682
Of course. Cheers.

48:12.765 --> 48:14.600
I must go to the little boys' room.

48:15.977 --> 48:18.730
I'm all right!
- "Little" being the operative word.

48:19.314 --> 48:21.899
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

48:30.700 --> 48:33.369
I think somebody needs to go home.

48:33.453 --> 48:37.248
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
- Not you. Him.

48:39.334 --> 48:40.668
What?

48:41.919 --> 48:45.797
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

48:45.881 --> 48:48.592
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.346
Oh, good grief.

48:52.679 --> 48:55.641
It's hardly in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

48:57.517 --> 49:00.020
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

49:00.103 --> 49:02.105
There you go.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.816
- And there's your change.
- God bless you.

49:05.484 --> 49:06.735
Bye-bye.

49:09.780 --> 49:11.365
I'm all right.

49:14.618 --> 49:16.453
I would not wanna be him in the morning.

49:27.338 --> 49:30.424
Well, this is me.

49:31.008 --> 49:34.762
Well, I shall see you in the morning.

49:34.845 --> 49:37.723
Unless you wanna come in
for a cup of coffee?

49:37.807 --> 49:40.476
- I don't drink coffee.
- Tea?

49:40.559 --> 49:42.603
No caffeine after midday.

49:43.354 --> 49:45.231
How about another beer?

49:52.947 --> 49:54.115
Oh, dear.

50:00.453 --> 50:03.790
- When did you move in?
- About five years ago.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.711
- You should get some house plants.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

50:07.794 --> 50:10.630
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

50:12.215 --> 50:15.760
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

50:15.844 --> 50:17.679
Its needs are simple.

50:21.975 --> 50:25.145
Janine used to say I love my Lily
more than I loved her.

50:25.228 --> 50:27.480
- Is that why you split up?
- What?

50:28.398 --> 50:31.817
- 'Cause you did it with a plant?
- No, no, no.

50:31.900 --> 50:35.446
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

50:35.738 --> 50:38.073
That's good though, right?

50:38.574 --> 50:40.034
Is it though?

50:40.117 --> 50:45.414
I did miss a few dinners.
You know, parties, a birthday or two.

50:45.497 --> 50:48.542
- Listen, mate, I...
- Her dad's funeral.

50:49.668 --> 50:54.089
- I just wanna be good at what I do.
- You are good at what you do.

50:55.674 --> 51:00.012
You've just gotta learn to switch off
that big old melon of yours.

51:02.056 --> 51:04.141
That's the whole problem, Danny.

51:07.518 --> 51:09.520
I don't think I know how.

51:10.438 --> 51:12.440
I can show you how.

51:18.446 --> 51:21.115
By the power of Grey Skull.

51:21.866 --> 51:24.285
<i>Point Break or Bad Boys II?</i>

51:24.369 --> 51:25.703
Which one do you think I'll prefer?

51:25.787 --> 51:27.914
No, I mean which one
do you wanna watch first?

51:27.997 --> 51:29.207
You are pulling my leg?

52:10.247 --> 52:12.249
What did you think of that?

52:12.332 --> 52:15.127
Well, I won't argue
that it was a no holds barred,

52:15.210 --> 52:18.254
adrenalin fuelled thrill ride
but there's no way you could perpetrate

52:18.337 --> 52:22.591
that amount of carnage and mayhem and not
incur a considerable amount of paperwork.

52:22.675 --> 52:24.010
That is nothing, man.

52:24.093 --> 52:25.761
This is about to go off.

52:41.861 --> 52:43.446
<i>This shit just got real.</i>

52:47.325 --> 52:49.076
Nasty way to go.

52:49.160 --> 52:53.164
I think our Mr Merchant tried to have
a little fry up and left the gas on.

52:54.998 --> 52:58.168
Spends his whole life
devoted to the refrigerator

52:58.418 --> 53:00.795
then gets killed by an oven.

53:01.796 --> 53:05.091
I told him several times,
you shouldn't eat late at night.

53:05.175 --> 53:08.094
Oh, I don't know.
I quite like a little midnight gobble.

53:08.178 --> 53:09.387
Cocks.

53:09.471 --> 53:13.141
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

53:14.476 --> 53:15.602
Help me.

53:16.144 --> 53:19.689
Okay, we get a proper cordon up,
we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

53:19.773 --> 53:22.525
and then we get forensics in
to do a thorough sweep of the house.

53:22.609 --> 53:25.320
Very good. What he said.

53:25.403 --> 53:27.530
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?

53:27.614 --> 53:29.950
Mr Messenger,
a statement will be issued shortly.

53:30.033 --> 53:32.701
Actually, I just wanted to ask,
"What's your perfect Sunday?"

53:32.785 --> 53:35.162
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.

53:35.245 --> 53:40.209
Now, my perfect Sunday
is a lovely long lie in...

53:40.876 --> 53:45.506
<i>Fire to destroy all you've done</i>

53:49.760 --> 53:51.011
Like in the films.

53:51.470 --> 53:54.181
<i>Something like,
something out of Backdraft.</i>

53:56.016 --> 53:59.311
- What are you thinking? Foul play?
Maybe.

53:59.770 --> 54:03.357
We're just hoping to talk to the last people
to see Mr Merchant alive.

54:03.774 --> 54:08.861
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe
and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.

54:08.945 --> 54:11.864
- That's us.
- Why is this such a big joke to you?

54:11.948 --> 54:13.408
Three people have died in a week.

54:13.491 --> 54:16.119
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock,
they were accidents.

54:16.202 --> 54:17.704
People have accidents every day.

54:17.787 --> 54:20.707
- The victims knew each other.
- Everyone knows everyone round here.

54:20.790 --> 54:24.043
Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,
then who did?

54:29.382 --> 54:31.301
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.

54:31.384 --> 54:33.636
We just catch the very edge
of the explosion.

54:33.720 --> 54:35.555
Nasty way to go.

54:35.638 --> 54:38.224
- There was something took my eye.
- Really? What's that?

54:39.058 --> 54:41.269
Sandford's most wanted.

54:43.145 --> 54:45.522
There you go. It was the swan all along.

54:45.606 --> 54:48.900
- This is not funny, Detective!
- Oh, give over, Miss Marples.

54:48.984 --> 54:51.403
Yeah, you do your job
and we'll do ours, eh?

54:51.486 --> 54:53.739
Yeah. Haven't you got
a church fete to look after?

54:53.822 --> 54:55.782
No, I have not!

54:56.742 --> 54:57.909
Actually.

55:03.915 --> 55:04.916
<i>Testing. Testing.</i>

55:04.958 --> 55:06.001
<i>Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

55:06.043 --> 55:08.086
<i>It's the raffle with
a very special guest presenter.</i>

55:08.170 --> 55:10.756
<i>Out in the country</i>

55:11.006 --> 55:14.927
<i>Far from all the sorts of noise of the city</i>

55:15.093 --> 55:17.596
<i>There's a village green</i>

55:17.679 --> 55:21.557
<i>It's been a long time since I last set eyes</i>

55:21.641 --> 55:23.768
<i>On the church with a steeple</i>

55:23.851 --> 55:26.062
That's me after a couple of pints.

55:26.228 --> 55:27.605
Splat the rat.

55:30.232 --> 55:31.984
Splat the rat.

55:34.070 --> 55:36.113
Splat the rat.

55:38.240 --> 55:39.784
Shark!

55:41.619 --> 55:43.579
Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?

55:43.663 --> 55:46.290
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.

55:46.374 --> 55:49.835
Sorry, Chief,
won't waste any more police time.

55:49.919 --> 55:51.128
Have a nice time.

55:51.212 --> 55:53.631
Actually, Nicholas,
you might as well take a break.

55:53.714 --> 55:56.508
Hey, great. I've got something to show you.

56:02.472 --> 56:05.433
- This is a rifle range.
- You'll be really good at it.

56:05.517 --> 56:07.978
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?

56:08.812 --> 56:13.441
Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,
five cans gets you the floppy lion.

56:13.525 --> 56:18.613
Take out all the little people,
you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.

56:19.739 --> 56:23.159
I thought I made it clear to you
how I feel about firearms.

56:23.243 --> 56:25.578
It's only an air rifle.

56:25.870 --> 56:27.038
Sergeant.

56:45.681 --> 56:47.391
Dear Lord!

56:48.767 --> 56:50.853
That was amazing.

56:55.316 --> 56:58.235
- Thank you, Danny.
- I can't believe I shot someone.

56:58.319 --> 57:01.572
- He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
- I never shot anyone before.

57:01.655 --> 57:03.866
Danny, believe me,
it's not something you ever get used to.

57:03.949 --> 57:06.200
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

57:06.284 --> 57:07.368
Take our minds off of it.

57:07.452 --> 57:09.370
- Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
- Mr Messenger.

57:09.454 --> 57:12.081
I need to talk to you
about George Merchant. Alone.

57:12.540 --> 57:14.792
Churchyard. 3:00.

57:16.461 --> 57:17.587
What do you think he wants?

57:17.670 --> 57:20.715
<i>Would
Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?</i>

57:23.760 --> 57:27.722
<i>Here to announce the winners is the newest
addition to the Sandford Police Force.</i>

57:27.805 --> 57:28.932
Service.

57:29.015 --> 57:30.767
<i>Sergeant Nicholas Angel.</i>

57:33.311 --> 57:34.604
- Prick.
- Wanker.

57:35.897 --> 57:38.066
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

57:55.123 --> 57:59.753
<i>The first name is Simon Skinner.</i>

58:02.756 --> 58:04.299
He's in the loo.

58:05.050 --> 58:07.427
<i>Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.</i>

58:29.782 --> 58:32.201
<i>And the next name is...</i>

58:47.592 --> 58:49.927
<i>Tim, your number's up.</i>

58:58.977 --> 59:00.604
Excuse me. Excuse me.

59:03.106 --> 59:04.316
Hi-hi.

59:08.820 --> 59:10.113
Oh, no!

59:15.452 --> 59:18.371
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

59:18.455 --> 59:21.166
- Accident?
- Just an accident.

59:21.791 --> 59:24.544
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

59:24.628 --> 59:28.465
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

59:37.181 --> 59:38.807
<i>Nicholas, what is it?</i>

59:38.891 --> 59:42.937
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

59:43.354 --> 59:46.523
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

59:46.607 --> 59:49.693
- Apparently, they can break a man's arm.
- Or blow up a man's house.

59:49.777 --> 59:52.738
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

59:53.238 --> 59:55.574
Now, let me get this straight.

59:56.575 --> 01:00:00.579
- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:02.039
Very well.

01:00:02.581 --> 01:00:03.666
- Detectives.
- Sir.

01:00:03.749 --> 01:00:05.334
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

01:00:05.417 --> 01:00:06.501
Oh, he's got shorts on.

01:00:06.584 --> 01:00:07.710
- Sergeant Fisher?
- What?

01:00:07.794 --> 01:00:09.212
- Secure the area.
- What?

01:00:09.295 --> 01:00:10.505
- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

01:00:10.588 --> 01:00:12.215
Get the CSI down here.

01:00:12.298 --> 01:00:13.508
PC Walker?

01:00:13.591 --> 01:00:15.885
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

01:00:15.969 --> 01:00:19.180
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

01:00:25.478 --> 01:00:27.647
Do you really think this is murder?

01:00:27.814 --> 01:00:29.399
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

01:00:29.482 --> 01:00:30.984
Yeah. I think you're right.

01:00:31.067 --> 01:00:33.319
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

01:00:34.028 --> 01:00:37.282
He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

01:00:37.615 --> 01:00:38.866
Pain in the arse.

01:00:39.117 --> 01:00:41.160
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.244 --> 01:00:43.078
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

01:00:43.161 --> 01:00:44.580
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

01:00:44.663 --> 01:00:46.957
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:50.502
<i>If you wanna wade through every copy of
the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.</i>

01:00:50.586 --> 01:00:52.504
It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

01:00:52.588 --> 01:00:56.842
This ain't the city, Mr Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

01:00:57.009 --> 01:01:00.429
It's high time you realised that.
You and your monkey.

01:01:03.765 --> 01:01:05.726
Did he mean me or that?

01:01:07.394 --> 01:01:09.605
Oh, maybe we should go home.

01:01:09.813 --> 01:01:12.899
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

01:01:12.983 --> 01:01:14.610
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

01:01:14.693 --> 01:01:15.819
What do you mean?

01:01:15.902 --> 01:01:17.445
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:19.572
- sunk into that thick skull of yours?
- Yeah.

01:01:19.655 --> 01:01:21.365
Has it? Like what?

01:01:21.907 --> 01:01:23.826
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.329
There's always something going on, Danny.

01:01:26.412 --> 01:01:30.041
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

01:01:30.124 --> 01:01:32.501
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

01:01:32.585 --> 01:01:34.211
- Oh, did you now?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.295 --> 01:01:36.589
You don't know how to switch off!

01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:12.249
<i>Well, if you wanna wade through every copy</i>

01:02:12.332 --> 01:02:14.626
<i>of the Sandford bloody Citizen,
be our guest.</i>

01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:54.832
- Morning, Constable.
- All right?

01:02:56.166 --> 01:02:58.085
Thanks for the monkey.

01:02:58.919 --> 01:03:01.463
- Yours, isn't it?
- I won it for you.

01:03:05.092 --> 01:03:07.051
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

01:03:07.135 --> 01:03:08.303
- Are you?
- Yes.

01:03:08.386 --> 01:03:12.724
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

01:03:13.182 --> 01:03:16.603
- We?
- Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:19.647
Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

01:03:19.731 --> 01:03:24.360
- Someone from London called for you.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

01:03:25.194 --> 01:03:26.321
- Tim Messenger.
- Go.

01:03:26.404 --> 01:03:28.239
<i>Editor and journalist
at The Sandford Citizen.</i>

01:03:28.323 --> 01:03:29.616
- Fondness for puns.
- Go on.

01:03:29.699 --> 01:03:30.825
- Terrible speller.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:30.909 --> 01:03:32.869
Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

01:03:32.952 --> 01:03:34.704
- George Merchant.
- Self-made millionaire.

01:03:34.829 --> 01:03:37.040
Fancied himself as a property developer.

01:03:37.123 --> 01:03:39.876
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

01:03:39.959 --> 01:03:42.127
But more importantly,
was a good friend and client of...

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.962
- Martin Blower.
- Respected solicitor.

01:03:44.046 --> 01:03:46.298
- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

01:03:46.381 --> 01:03:47.799
- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

01:03:47.883 --> 01:03:49.426
- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

01:03:49.509 --> 01:03:51.178
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

01:03:51.261 --> 01:03:53.221
- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

01:03:53.305 --> 01:03:56.141
- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

01:03:56.224 --> 01:03:57.643
- Favoured older men.
- Fingered.

01:03:57.726 --> 01:03:58.977
- Worked at?
- Council.

01:03:59.061 --> 01:04:01.772
- More specifically?
- Department of Planning and Development.

01:04:01.855 --> 01:04:03.482
Where George Merchant secured permission

01:04:03.565 --> 01:04:05.943
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

01:04:06.026 --> 01:04:07.152
So...

01:04:07.235 --> 01:04:11.323
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

01:04:12.658 --> 01:04:15.160
- What are you two up to?
- Nothing.

01:04:15.244 --> 01:04:16.370
Well, look sharp.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:19.205
- There's been reports of a fire in the station.
- What?

01:04:19.288 --> 01:04:22.959
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:04:23.042 --> 01:04:27.255
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

01:04:27.338 --> 01:04:31.008
- Danny, why didn't you say something?
- We were working, weren't we?

01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:36.472
- Hey, where are you going?
- Personal errand.

01:04:43.271 --> 01:04:44.689
Hello, Miss Tiller.

01:04:44.772 --> 01:04:47.483
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

01:04:47.566 --> 01:04:48.985
Of course.

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:52.196
I was just about to pop off, actually.

01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:55.323
I can never find my scissors.

01:04:55.574 --> 01:04:59.536
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:05:01.955 --> 01:05:06.585
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:10.880
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

01:05:10.964 --> 01:05:15.802
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

01:05:16.011 --> 01:05:18.930
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

01:05:19.014 --> 01:05:22.183
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

01:05:22.267 --> 01:05:25.854
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

01:05:25.937 --> 01:05:28.064
and I thought I might take them up on it.

01:05:28.148 --> 01:05:31.859
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

01:05:31.942 --> 01:05:35.404
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

01:05:35.487 --> 01:05:37.489
Would you like a card with this?

01:05:37.656 --> 01:05:39.950
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

01:05:40.034 --> 01:05:43.245
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

01:05:43.329 --> 01:05:45.497
knew where the new bypass road is going

01:05:45.581 --> 01:05:48.667
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:52.463
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

01:05:52.546 --> 01:05:54.673
and tells me this land's very valuable.

01:05:54.757 --> 01:05:58.844
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

01:05:58.928 --> 01:06:01.931
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

01:06:02.014 --> 01:06:04.808
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

01:06:04.892 --> 01:06:06.935
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

01:06:07.018 --> 01:06:09.854
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping centre or something.

01:06:09.938 --> 01:06:12.732
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

01:06:12.815 --> 01:06:14.901
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

01:06:14.984 --> 01:06:17.612
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:34.045
Stop!

01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:36.547
In the name of the law!

01:07:34.729 --> 01:07:36.731
<i>Hang about, hang about.</i>

01:07:37.565 --> 01:07:39.859
You're saying this wasn't an accident?

01:07:41.193 --> 01:07:43.237
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

01:07:43.321 --> 01:07:44.780
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

01:07:44.864 --> 01:07:46.032
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

01:07:46.115 --> 01:07:47.366
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:49.076
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.037
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:53.038
Thank you, Danny.

01:07:53.121 --> 01:07:56.458
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

01:07:57.042 --> 01:07:58.209
Thank you, Andy.

01:07:58.293 --> 01:08:02.547
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

01:08:02.631 --> 01:08:03.715
What are you suggesting?

01:08:03.798 --> 01:08:06.301
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

01:08:06.384 --> 01:08:08.845
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

01:08:08.929 --> 01:08:12.390
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

01:08:12.474 --> 01:08:15.435
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

01:08:15.518 --> 01:08:16.895
Why were you there?

01:08:16.978 --> 01:08:21.233
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

01:08:21.316 --> 01:08:23.902
What absolute horseshit.

01:08:23.984 --> 01:08:27.948
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

01:08:28.031 --> 01:08:31.116
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.911
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

01:08:34.745 --> 01:08:37.456
Am I going completely mad?

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:41.252
Maybe you are.

01:08:43.170 --> 01:08:45.923
Maybe you did it.

01:08:46.006 --> 01:08:49.343
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:50.844
- What the...
- Sergeant Angel?

01:08:50.928 --> 01:08:53.430
Yes! Sir.

01:08:56.015 --> 01:08:58.894
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

01:08:58.978 --> 01:09:01.564
What am I going to do with you?

01:09:01.647 --> 01:09:06.192
- Sir, you have to understand...
- No, you have to understand.

01:09:07.193 --> 01:09:11.154
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.283
The "M" word, Nicholas.

01:09:14.367 --> 01:09:18.580
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

01:09:18.662 --> 01:09:20.497
But, sir, I'm certain.

01:09:20.999 --> 01:09:24.252
And what's more, I know who did it.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:32.218
Can I see the manager, please?

01:09:37.724 --> 01:09:43.687
<i>Mr Skinner to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Mr Skinner.</i>

01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:47.858
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:52.029
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

01:09:52.112 --> 01:09:55.574
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

01:09:55.699 --> 01:09:58.035
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:02.998
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

01:10:03.081 --> 01:10:04.708
of George Merchant on April 29th

01:10:04.791 --> 01:10:07.377
and of Eve Draper
and Martin Blower on April 28th.

01:10:07.461 --> 01:10:11.465
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
- I'm glad you asked.

01:10:13.216 --> 01:10:15.385
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

01:10:15.469 --> 01:10:18.262
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,
on the outskirts of Sandford,</i>

01:10:18.346 --> 01:10:22.183
<i>despite the fact you live and work
in the centre of the village.</i>

01:10:23.392 --> 01:10:27.730
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theatre on the previous evening.

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.942
<i>When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

01:10:31.025 --> 01:10:33.027
<i>but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council</i>

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:36.072
<i>might make her privy
to important information.</i>

01:10:36.155 --> 01:10:38.449
<i>You even spoke of "bashing her head in."</i>

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:42.161
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

01:10:42.245 --> 01:10:44.497
<i>You were already suspicious
that George Merchant was buying up</i>

01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:46.874
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.919
<i>after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.</i>

01:10:50.002 --> 01:10:53.672
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

01:10:53.755 --> 01:10:57.676
<i>if it became accessible by road,
it would be a prime location for say,</i>

01:10:58.051 --> 01:10:59.719
a retail park.

01:10:59.803 --> 01:11:01.805
Consumed with concern for your business

01:11:01.888 --> 01:11:03.932
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

01:11:04.015 --> 01:11:06.601
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

01:11:07.102 --> 01:11:09.771
<i>You killed the competition in cold blood.</i>

01:11:09.854 --> 01:11:11.773
<i>Staging the murders as accidents.</i>

01:11:11.856 --> 01:11:14.943
<i>You used a vehicle removal truck
to stage the Blower-Draper death</i>

01:11:15.026 --> 01:11:16.945
<i>and incinerated an old man
in his own house.</i>

01:11:17.028 --> 01:11:20.240
<i>Covering your tracks with the judicial
application of bacon and beans.</i>

01:11:20.323 --> 01:11:23.285
However, there was a loose end.

01:11:24.327 --> 01:11:25.787
Tim Messenger.

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:28.039
<i>Splattered before he could share with me</i>

01:11:28.123 --> 01:11:31.083
<i>what he told Leslie Tiller
that very afternoon.</i>

01:11:31.166 --> 01:11:34.003
<i>The true value of her land.</i>

01:11:34.378 --> 01:11:37.298
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

01:11:37.381 --> 01:11:40.217
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

01:11:40.301 --> 01:11:45.055
And made good your escape utilising
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.316
Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

01:11:56.901 --> 01:11:57.985
He hasn't.

01:11:58.068 --> 01:12:01.822
Why would I kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

01:12:01.906 --> 01:12:04.490
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

01:12:05.992 --> 01:12:10.330
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

01:12:10.622 --> 01:12:14.000
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

01:12:14.083 --> 01:12:17.253
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
- What a Gaylord.

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:18.880
Thank you, Andrews.

01:12:18.963 --> 01:12:22.342
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

01:12:22.425 --> 01:12:25.970
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

01:12:26.054 --> 01:12:29.682
Anything to energise my workforce.

01:12:31.184 --> 01:12:35.813
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

01:12:35.897 --> 01:12:38.358
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

01:12:38.441 --> 01:12:41.818
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

01:12:41.902 --> 01:12:44.071
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

01:12:44.154 --> 01:12:46.615
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

01:12:46.698 --> 01:12:49.076
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

01:12:49.159 --> 01:12:52.079
Many people hold down several jobs.

01:12:52.162 --> 01:12:55.874
I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

01:12:55.958 --> 01:12:59.002
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

01:12:59.336 --> 01:13:03.215
Nevertheless, you could have utilised
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

01:13:03.298 --> 01:13:05.342
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

01:13:05.425 --> 01:13:08.053
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

01:13:08.136 --> 01:13:10.722
Well, you've got me there.

01:13:10.806 --> 01:13:12.808
I'd need something conclusive.

01:13:12.891 --> 01:13:15.060
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:19.188
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.

01:13:20.815 --> 01:13:22.483
This very evening.

01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:27.029
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

01:13:27.113 --> 01:13:30.283
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:13:32.577 --> 01:13:37.248
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

01:13:37.957 --> 01:13:40.626
Do feel free to spool through.

01:13:58.101 --> 01:13:59.185
I can handle this, Danny.

01:13:59.269 --> 01:14:02.564
You might as well go back
and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:05.233
- Did you really get me that plant?
- Yes, I did.

01:14:05.317 --> 01:14:08.778
But it's been impounded as evidence.

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:13.491
Well, I mean,
maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?

01:14:13.575 --> 01:14:14.743
Yeah.

01:14:18.163 --> 01:14:19.581
Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:23.001
if I do indeed now
own the land belonging to...

01:14:24.753 --> 01:14:30.591
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it
into a memorial garden, in her honour.

01:14:30.674 --> 01:14:35.262
Mr Skinner, what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine,

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:39.266
So jog on.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:44.772
Michael, will you escort the Sergeant
off the premises when he's quite finished?

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.398
Yarp.

01:14:49.526 --> 01:14:53.864
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

01:14:53.948 --> 01:14:56.283
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

01:15:04.415 --> 01:15:06.626
Hey, that weren't me.

01:15:14.676 --> 01:15:15.843
Hey, look.

01:15:15.927 --> 01:15:18.638
Look, Mr Treacher's
got his big coat on again.

01:15:22.308 --> 01:15:26.729
- You want anything from the shop?
- Cornetto.

01:15:29.274 --> 01:15:33.486
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

01:15:36.864 --> 01:15:40.158
<i>- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.</i>

01:15:40.242 --> 01:15:43.579
<i>- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.</i>

01:15:43.662 --> 01:15:47.666
<i>- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.</i>

01:15:47.749 --> 01:15:51.003
- What's the matter? You got brain-freeze?
- No, I got brainwave.

01:15:51.086 --> 01:15:53.380
Get us back to the station, now!

01:16:00.345 --> 01:16:02.055
- It's more than one person.
- Come again?

01:16:02.139 --> 01:16:05.017
- It's more than one killer.
- It was Skinner a minute ago.

01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:06.184
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.

01:16:06.268 --> 01:16:08.645
You know, maybe he's... Maybe he's
not alone. Maybe there are others.

01:16:08.729 --> 01:16:13.901
Nicholas, you're an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before.

01:16:14.359 --> 01:16:16.944
- Sir?
- Sergeant Popwell.

01:16:17.028 --> 01:16:19.864
It was exactly the same thing.

01:16:19.947 --> 01:16:24.368
You've come from a city
where there's danger round every corner,

01:16:24.827 --> 01:16:27.371
and it's driven you round the bend.

01:16:27.872 --> 01:16:29.165
Yes, sir.

01:16:29.415 --> 01:16:32.877
Do yourself a favour. Sleep on it.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:38.716
And if you still feel the same in the morning,
I give you my word, I'll get right on to it.

01:16:43.054 --> 01:16:45.973
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

01:16:46.599 --> 01:16:50.561
Nothing, nothing.
I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.

01:16:50.645 --> 01:16:56.149
- I mean, do you want a lift?
- No, no, I could do with a walk.

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:02.506
Hey, big one, playtime's over.

01:18:06.885 --> 01:18:08.261
<i>Michael?</i>

01:18:09.137 --> 01:18:11.806
<i>Michael? Are you there?</i>

01:18:12.473 --> 01:18:16.519
<i>Michael? Is everything okay?</i>

01:18:19.188 --> 01:18:20.356
Yarp.

01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:23.192
<i>Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?</i>

01:18:23.276 --> 01:18:24.402
Yarp.

01:18:24.485 --> 01:18:26.946
<i>He's not gonna get back up again?</i>

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:30.867
Narp!

01:18:32.118 --> 01:18:34.704
<i>Good. Proceed to the castle.</i>

01:18:39.917 --> 01:18:41.668
Frank, this shit just got real.

01:18:41.752 --> 01:18:45.547
Skinner just sent someone to kill me,
and, now, now he's gone somewhere.

01:18:45.631 --> 01:18:48.217
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.636
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

01:18:52.721 --> 01:18:57.226
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

01:18:57.476 --> 01:19:01.396
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:03.565
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:08.278
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

01:19:08.362 --> 01:19:12.115
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:48.734
<i>How could I possibly be
in several places at once?</i>

01:19:48.818 --> 01:19:51.987
<i>How could I possibly be
in several places at once?</i>

01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:55.365
<i>How could I possibly be
in several places at once?</i>

01:19:56.491 --> 01:20:00.620
<i>I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?</i>

01:20:00.704 --> 01:20:03.790
<i>You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.</i>

01:20:03.874 --> 01:20:05.709
<i>Who could do something like this?</i>

01:20:05.792 --> 01:20:09.170
<i>Seems like Mr Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left the gas on.</i>

01:20:09.254 --> 01:20:10.589
<i>Nasty way to go.</i>

01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.798
<i>What happened, Danny?</i>

01:20:11.882 --> 01:20:13.717
<i>No luck catching them killers, then?</i>

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.677
<i>No luck catching them killers, then?</i>

01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.971
<i>No luck catching them...</i>

01:20:21.433 --> 01:20:23.852
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

01:20:23.935 --> 01:20:28.314
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

01:20:28.397 --> 01:20:33.694
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

01:20:33.944 --> 01:20:36.280
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

01:20:36.488 --> 01:20:39.617
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:44.371
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

01:20:44.455 --> 01:20:50.044
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

01:20:50.127 --> 01:20:54.381
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

01:20:54.465 --> 01:20:56.550
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

01:20:56.634 --> 01:21:00.721
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

01:21:00.804 --> 01:21:01.889
Quite right.

01:21:01.972 --> 01:21:05.433
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

01:21:05.516 --> 01:21:08.394
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.

01:21:08.478 --> 01:21:12.732
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

01:21:13.066 --> 01:21:16.236
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

01:21:16.319 --> 01:21:19.072
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

01:21:19.155 --> 01:21:22.033
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

01:21:22.116 --> 01:21:24.911
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

01:21:24.994 --> 01:21:26.579
You should be ashamed.

01:21:26.663 --> 01:21:30.250
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

01:21:30.333 --> 01:21:32.085
It's all about the greater good.

01:21:32.168 --> 01:21:33.670
The greater good.

01:21:33.753 --> 01:21:35.255
How can this be for the greater good?

01:21:35.338 --> 01:21:36.881
The greater good.

01:21:36.965 --> 01:21:39.092
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

01:21:39.175 --> 01:21:40.884
the truth is far less complex.

01:21:40.968 --> 01:21:46.181
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

01:21:47.683 --> 01:21:48.934
Quite appalling.

01:21:49.017 --> 01:21:50.769
You murdered him for that?

01:21:51.853 --> 01:21:54.273
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

01:21:54.356 --> 01:21:57.859
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

01:21:58.193 --> 01:21:59.653
<i>Couldn't let
Blower jeopardise that.</i>

01:21:59.736 --> 01:22:01.989
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

01:22:02.072 --> 01:22:04.658
<i>Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.</i>

01:22:04.741 --> 01:22:06.618
<i>And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.</i>

01:22:06.702 --> 01:22:08.120
Yes, I know!

01:22:08.203 --> 01:22:10.831
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

01:22:10.914 --> 01:22:14.126
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:15.793
And so Eve deserved to die too?

01:22:15.877 --> 01:22:18.296
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:19.630
Annoying.

01:22:19.714 --> 01:22:22.550
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

01:22:22.842 --> 01:22:23.926
Awful.

01:22:24.010 --> 01:22:25.678
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

01:22:25.761 --> 01:22:28.306
more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:31.976
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

01:22:32.059 --> 01:22:36.772
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.</i>

01:22:36.856 --> 01:22:40.693
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

01:22:40.776 --> 01:22:42.737
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:46.073
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

01:22:46.157 --> 01:22:47.658
Fifty-three.

01:22:47.742 --> 01:22:49.410
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

01:22:49.493 --> 01:22:51.995
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

01:22:52.078 --> 01:22:54.122
Oh, she was ever so good.

01:22:54.206 --> 01:22:56.374
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

01:22:56.666 --> 01:23:00.378
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

01:23:00.462 --> 01:23:03.840
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

01:23:03.924 --> 01:23:05.884
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

01:23:05.967 --> 01:23:08.637
If we can't have her, no one can.

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.305
How can this be for the greater good?

01:23:10.388 --> 01:23:12.432
The greater good.
- Shut it!

01:23:12.515 --> 01:23:15.685
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

01:23:15.769 --> 01:23:18.271
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:23:20.023 --> 01:23:21.399
Hello, Nicholas.

01:23:22.484 --> 01:23:24.402
I was like you once.

01:23:25.028 --> 01:23:28.447
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

01:23:28.739 --> 01:23:32.576
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

01:23:33.494 --> 01:23:36.163
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

01:23:36.247 --> 01:23:40.251
She was head of the Women's Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

01:23:40.334 --> 01:23:42.419
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

01:23:42.503 --> 01:23:46.215
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:52.888
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

01:23:53.681 --> 01:23:57.226
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

01:23:57.309 --> 01:23:59.645
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

01:23:59.728 --> 01:24:01.480
Crusty jugglers.

01:24:01.564 --> 01:24:04.649
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

01:24:05.608 --> 01:24:09.779
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

01:24:09.863 --> 01:24:14.993
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

01:24:15.326 --> 01:24:19.831
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

01:24:20.164 --> 01:24:22.041
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

01:24:22.125 --> 01:24:26.004
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

01:24:26.087 --> 01:24:28.798
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

01:24:28.882 --> 01:24:32.594
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

01:24:32.677 --> 01:24:37.140
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream worid.

01:24:37.223 --> 01:24:39.850
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

01:24:39.933 --> 01:24:41.977
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:44.479
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

01:24:44.563 --> 01:24:46.315
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

01:24:46.398 --> 01:24:48.483
You are all gonna have to come with me.

01:24:48.567 --> 01:24:52.654
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

01:24:52.738 --> 01:24:55.490
who is going to have to come with us.

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:05.125
Danny, no.

01:25:09.504 --> 01:25:11.006
Back off! Back off!

01:25:11.089 --> 01:25:13.342
Or I swear to God,
you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

01:25:13.425 --> 01:25:14.885
and accidentally cut off his own head.

01:25:14.968 --> 01:25:17.136
Come on, Nicholas.
You haven't got it in you.

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:18.554
I mean it!

01:25:22.225 --> 01:25:23.476
Shit!

01:25:38.241 --> 01:25:41.577
<i>Gypsy scum. Travellers.</i>

01:25:41.661 --> 01:25:44.747
<i>Thieving kids. Dog muck.</i>

01:25:46.999 --> 01:25:48.876
<i>Crusty jugglers.</i>

01:25:49.085 --> 01:25:52.671
<i>Crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.</i>

01:25:53.547 --> 01:25:54.881
<i>Crusty jugglers.</i>

01:25:54.965 --> 01:25:58.593
<i>There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.</i>

01:25:58.677 --> 01:26:01.638
<i>There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.</i>

01:26:01.721 --> 01:26:04.266
<i>Spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.</i>

01:26:04.349 --> 01:26:07.143
<i>I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.</i>

01:26:12.274 --> 01:26:15.151
<i>If we don't come down hard
on these clowns...</i>

01:26:15.235 --> 01:26:16.945
<i>We'll get round to it.</i>

01:26:29.206 --> 01:26:30.374
Danny!

01:27:05.325 --> 01:27:06.659
Ta-da.

01:27:06.868 --> 01:27:10.079
- What are you doing?
- Saving your skin.

01:27:12.332 --> 01:27:15.043
- This is murder!
- It's not, it's ketchup.

01:27:15.126 --> 01:27:17.879
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.

01:27:17.962 --> 01:27:20.924
- What others?
- The others the NWA have murdered.

01:27:21.007 --> 01:27:22.342
- That's not true.
- It is!

01:27:22.425 --> 01:27:24.594
Dad just said it was his special club, he...

01:27:24.677 --> 01:27:26.554
I thought it was about
rapping people on the knuckles

01:27:26.638 --> 01:27:29.849
- and sending them on their way.
- There are skeletons back there!

01:27:29.933 --> 01:27:31.517
I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.

01:27:31.601 --> 01:27:33.853
- What did you think was happening?
- Not this!

01:27:33.937 --> 01:27:35.063
It's Frank.

01:27:35.146 --> 01:27:37.357
He's appointed himself judge,
jury and executioner.

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.776
- He's not Judge Judy and executioner.
- He is!

01:27:40.859 --> 01:27:44.029
- You've gotta help me take him down.
- I can't.

01:27:45.072 --> 01:27:47.908
He's my dad. Take my car.

01:27:48.992 --> 01:27:51.954
Go back to London.
There's nothing you can do.

01:27:52.037 --> 01:27:53.539
I can come back.

01:27:53.622 --> 01:27:55.749
I can come back,
and I can bring the blue fury

01:27:55.832 --> 01:27:57.876
of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.

01:27:57.960 --> 01:28:00.963
They'll make it disappear.
Who are they gonna believe?

01:28:01.046 --> 01:28:03.799
My dad, or a loony London police officer.

01:28:03.882 --> 01:28:05.425
But it won't be just me, will it?

01:28:05.509 --> 01:28:08.720
We can do it together.
You and me. Partners.

01:28:08.971 --> 01:28:12.724
Forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.

01:29:04.816 --> 01:29:06.193
Is that everything? Sir?

01:29:12.699 --> 01:29:16.119
Sir? Sir?

01:29:17.621 --> 01:29:21.833
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.

01:29:25.045 --> 01:29:27.338
This is something I have to do myself.

01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:56.867
Another beautiful day in God's country.

01:30:04.541 --> 01:30:06.042
Danny?

01:30:15.093 --> 01:30:16.386
It's...

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:22.809
Mum!

01:30:34.195 --> 01:30:35.655
What you gonna do?

01:30:35.738 --> 01:30:38.824
Just walk in and arrest the whole village?

01:30:40.576 --> 01:30:41.785
Not exactly.

01:31:14.775 --> 01:31:18.029
Oh, Sergeant Angel?
Someone from London called for you.

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.414
I'll tell them you'll ring them back.

01:31:30.666 --> 01:31:32.835
- Well, that's funny.
- What's that?

01:31:33.294 --> 01:31:35.963
I didn't know we had a mounted division.

01:31:36.047 --> 01:31:37.798
Nobody tells me nothing.

01:31:54.189 --> 01:31:55.982
Wanna do something useful?

01:32:05.450 --> 01:32:10.372
<i>Annette, that Sergeant Angel's
back. Check out his horse.</i>

01:32:11.331 --> 01:32:13.291
<i>Roger that!</i>

01:32:15.001 --> 01:32:18.004
- It's...
- Angel.

01:33:29.282 --> 01:33:30.450
Morning.

01:34:53.989 --> 01:34:55.949
That's what I'm talking about.

01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.049
Still feel like you're missing out?

01:35:39.742 --> 01:35:41.118
Fascist!

01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.928
Hag!

01:36:17.403 --> 01:36:21.115
Stop! Stop this, please!

01:36:21.783 --> 01:36:25.161
Let us stop this mindless violence.

01:36:26.454 --> 01:36:28.456
Nicholas, my son.

01:36:29.582 --> 01:36:33.545
You may not be a man of God,
but surely you're a man of peace.

01:36:33.628 --> 01:36:39.383
I may not be a man of God, Reverend,
but I know right, and I know wrong,

01:36:40.092 --> 01:36:42.678
and I have the good grace
to know which is which.

01:36:42.761 --> 01:36:45.806
Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.

01:36:47.391 --> 01:36:48.851
No!

01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:51.812
Jesus Christ!

01:36:52.312 --> 01:36:54.314
Nicholas! Nicholas!

01:37:00.612 --> 01:37:02.406
I thought you was a goner.

01:37:02.489 --> 01:37:04.199
Drop your weapons!

01:37:04.825 --> 01:37:07.244
- Dr. Hatcher, no!
- Shut up, Danny.

01:37:08.203 --> 01:37:11.748
I brought you into this worid,
I think it's rather fitting

01:37:11.832 --> 01:37:14.667
I should be the one to take you out of it.

01:37:15.001 --> 01:37:18.838
You and your interfering little friend.

01:37:19.297 --> 01:37:20.464
Now...

01:37:24.844 --> 01:37:26.095
drop them.

01:37:42.612 --> 01:37:46.741
- You're a doctor, deal with it.
- Yeah, motherfucker.

01:37:47.366 --> 01:37:49.702
- Danny, let's roll.
- What you thinking?

01:37:51.703 --> 01:37:52.787
Pub?

01:38:52.930 --> 01:38:54.890
Roy!

01:38:55.599 --> 01:38:58.644
Somebody call the police!

01:38:58.727 --> 01:38:59.895
Freeze!

01:39:02.772 --> 01:39:05.608
Officers, arrest that man.

01:39:06.067 --> 01:39:09.279
- Danny, step away from the Sergeant.
- No, Dad.

01:39:09.654 --> 01:39:12.073
Danny, you'll do as you're told.

01:39:12.156 --> 01:39:14.659
I'm not taking orders from you anymore.

01:39:14.742 --> 01:39:18.246
- Officers, arrest these men!
- Wait, wait!

01:39:18.329 --> 01:39:19.455
You can arrest us if you like.

01:39:19.539 --> 01:39:22.167
You can throw us in prison and go back
to being blind, submissive slaves.

01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:24.085
Or you can be real police officers,

01:39:24.169 --> 01:39:26.379
and help us bring an end
to this absurd story.

01:39:26.462 --> 01:39:28.631
What the fuck is he on about?

01:39:28.715 --> 01:39:29.924
Fuck are you on about?

01:39:30.008 --> 01:39:32.635
Have you ever wondered
why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?

01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:36.514
- And yet the accident rate, it's so high?
- No. Yeah. What?

01:39:36.598 --> 01:39:38.473
You've been brainwashed, Tony.

01:39:38.557 --> 01:39:41.810
Brainwashed into naivety by an old man
with a murderous obsession.

01:39:41.894 --> 01:39:46.815
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.

01:39:46.899 --> 01:39:49.943
And it's only now that I'm starting to realise
how unridiculous it all is.

01:39:50.027 --> 01:39:51.528
Silence, Danny!

01:39:51.945 --> 01:39:54.781
- Think of your mother.
- Mum is dead, Dad.

01:39:55.991 --> 01:39:59.369
For the first time in my life,
you know, I'm glad.

01:39:59.453 --> 01:40:01.830
If she could see what you've become,

01:40:01.914 --> 01:40:06.043
I think she'd probably kill herself
all over again.

01:40:06.126 --> 01:40:07.711
Sorry, I am completely lost.

01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:09.463
Sandford is a lie, Doris.

01:40:09.546 --> 01:40:12.966
For the last 20 years, the village
has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.

01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.510
They've lulled everyone
into thinking this is a perfect village

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:18.387
and killed anyone
who's threatened to change that.

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:28.105
I reckon he's got something there.

01:40:29.565 --> 01:40:32.568
He says,
"He reckons you got something there."

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:33.903
I know.

01:40:33.986 --> 01:40:37.240
You're not seriously gonna
believe this man, are you?

01:40:37.323 --> 01:40:40.409
Are you? He isn't even from round here.

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:48.584
Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.

01:40:50.252 --> 01:40:52.838
You incompetent flatfoots!

01:41:01.972 --> 01:41:04.641
Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon
and hold everything down.

01:41:04.724 --> 01:41:05.851
Fair enough.

01:41:05.934 --> 01:41:07.978
Officers, let's go.

01:41:08.937 --> 01:41:11.314
- What about Dad?
- He'll come round again.

01:41:11.606 --> 01:41:13.441
Want anything from the shop?

01:41:31.208 --> 01:41:32.418
- What you thinking?
- Well...

01:41:32.501 --> 01:41:34.503
We should strike now,
while we've got the element of surprise.

01:41:34.587 --> 01:41:36.380
Longer we wait,
more time they've got to mobilise.

01:41:36.463 --> 01:41:39.258
I say we go in through the front entrance,
take the place aisle by aisle.

01:41:39.341 --> 01:41:41.218
They won't be expecting that.

01:41:41.802 --> 01:41:43.512
Very good. What he said.

01:41:45.723 --> 01:41:48.976
My, my. Here come the fuzz.

01:41:51.187 --> 01:41:53.981
- Maybe they're not here.
- Wait here.

01:41:54.064 --> 01:41:57.610
- Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.

01:42:00.529 --> 01:42:02.155
Okay. They're in.

01:42:02.238 --> 01:42:05.366
You deal with the store.
I'll deal with the trolley boy.

01:42:14.667 --> 01:42:19.172
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael,
wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.

01:42:19.339 --> 01:42:21.925
Is this what you really, really want?

01:42:22.217 --> 01:42:23.343
Yarp.

01:42:23.676 --> 01:42:24.928
Suit yourself.

01:42:33.603 --> 01:42:35.313
Go, go, go.

01:42:37.689 --> 01:42:39.816
Oh, come on.

01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:53.997
Andy!

01:42:56.708 --> 01:42:59.711
It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!

01:44:00.145 --> 01:44:02.105
- How's Lurch?
- He's in the freezer.

01:44:02.189 --> 01:44:04.608
- Did you say, "Cool off"?
- No, I didn't say anything, actually.

01:44:04.691 --> 01:44:06.401
Shame.

01:44:06.484 --> 01:44:07.903
There was a bit earlier on that you missed

01:44:07.986 --> 01:44:09.571
when I distracted him
with the cuddly monkey.

01:44:09.654 --> 01:44:12.449
And then I said, "Playtime's over,"
and I hit him with the Peace Lily.

01:44:12.532 --> 01:44:14.618
You're off the fucking chain!

01:44:14.701 --> 01:44:18.205
- What's the situation?
- Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.

01:44:18.288 --> 01:44:19.706
What do you reckon?

01:44:23.043 --> 01:44:24.252
Idea.

01:44:47.942 --> 01:44:49.443
Good work, everyone.

01:44:59.161 --> 01:45:02.163
- Nice one, Doris.
- Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

01:45:04.833 --> 01:45:06.918
Fruit attack!

01:45:07.710 --> 01:45:10.547
Can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go after the big boss.

01:45:10.630 --> 01:45:12.549
We're on it, Sergeant.

01:45:13.007 --> 01:45:14.843
- Danny, let's rock.
- Angel!

01:45:14.926 --> 01:45:16.678
Don't go being a twat now.

01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:19.222
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

01:45:26.437 --> 01:45:28.022
- We should get down there.
- How?

01:45:28.106 --> 01:45:30.525
Skip.

01:45:36.489 --> 01:45:39.533
- Head them off?
- Fuck, yeah.

01:45:50.794 --> 01:45:54.464
- I'll drive.
- Shotgun! Punch that shit!

01:46:38.299 --> 01:46:39.842
Bang! Bang!

01:46:45.806 --> 01:46:47.141
Swan!

01:47:06.535 --> 01:47:07.661
Swan!

01:47:35.187 --> 01:47:39.358
Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!

01:47:41.277 --> 01:47:43.863
You little fucker!

01:48:19.647 --> 01:48:23.943
Get out of my village!

01:48:29.908 --> 01:48:32.410
It's not your village anymore.

01:48:49.259 --> 01:48:51.094
- You did good, kid.
- Ta.

01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:53.430
- What's your name?
- Aaron A. Aaronson.

01:48:53.805 --> 01:48:55.307
Sorry?

01:48:57.267 --> 01:49:03.899
Angel!

01:49:21.791 --> 01:49:23.125
It's over, Danny.

01:49:24.544 --> 01:49:25.711
It's over.

01:49:29.507 --> 01:49:34.804
This really hurts.

01:49:34.887 --> 01:49:40.309
I'm going to need some ice-cream.

01:49:40.393 --> 01:49:43.563
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.

01:49:43.646 --> 01:49:44.814
Isn't that right, Danny?

01:49:46.065 --> 01:49:47.191
Stay back!

01:49:47.275 --> 01:49:50.735
- Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!
- Now, now.

01:49:51.069 --> 01:49:52.821
We don't want any more bloodshed.

01:49:52.904 --> 01:49:55.657
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:57.659
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

01:49:57.742 --> 01:50:00.287
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!

01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:45.039
I feel like I should say something smart.

01:50:45.122 --> 01:50:47.917
You don't have to say anything at all.

01:50:59.803 --> 01:51:03.223
Satisfactory conclusion
to the whole operation.

01:51:03.306 --> 01:51:07.310
Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...

01:51:12.607 --> 01:51:14.067
What do you say, Nicholas?

01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:16.361
We... We...
We have been trying to reach you for days.

01:51:16.444 --> 01:51:19.614
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
We need you back.

01:51:19.697 --> 01:51:23.535
The figures have gone a little squiffy
in your absence, it has to be said.

01:51:23.618 --> 01:51:24.744
Come back to London.

01:51:24.828 --> 01:51:28.081
Sandford's hardly a fitting place
for such an exceptional officer.

01:51:28.164 --> 01:51:30.875
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

01:51:31.793 --> 01:51:33.586
I kind of like it here.

01:51:33.670 --> 01:51:37.047
Besides, we have to do
a considerable amount of paperwork.

01:52:07.452 --> 01:52:08.495
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

01:52:08.537 --> 01:52:09.538
Well, good job
we've got the manpower, Andy?

01:52:09.872 --> 01:52:14.125
Well, official vocab guidelines state
that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"

01:52:14.208 --> 01:52:16.878
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.

01:52:19.255 --> 01:52:21.090
You don't mind a bit
of manpower do you, Doris?

01:52:21.174 --> 01:52:23.509
Oh, dirty bastard!

01:52:25.261 --> 01:52:26.429
Andy!

01:52:26.512 --> 01:52:28.556
You cheeky fucker!

01:52:37.315 --> 01:52:39.233
You know what you are?

01:52:40.067 --> 01:52:41.736
A bloody busybody!

01:52:47.533 --> 01:52:49.826
No!

01:53:04.299 --> 01:53:05.509
Oh, God, no!

01:53:28.781 --> 01:53:30.032
Danny!

01:53:32.535 --> 01:53:33.661
Danny!

01:53:34.703 --> 01:53:35.871
Oh, God.

01:53:35.955 --> 01:53:37.581
Hold on, Danny, just hold on.

01:53:37.665 --> 01:53:40.417
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

01:53:41.001 --> 01:53:43.796
Just hang on, hang on!

01:53:44.255 --> 01:53:46.090
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:47.341 --> 01:53:49.135
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:49.593 --> 01:53:51.428
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:52.179 --> 01:53:54.223
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:54:32.886 --> 01:54:33.970
Hope these are okay.

01:54:37.055 --> 01:54:40.476
Yeah. They're lovely.

01:54:50.027 --> 01:54:53.197
<i>- Any officers near the church?
- Go ahead, Doris.</i>

01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:54.990
<i>Chief, we've had a report
of some hippy types</i>

01:54:55.073 --> 01:54:57.534
<i>messing with the recycling bins
at the supermarket.</i>

01:54:57.618 --> 01:54:59.328
<i>- Leave it with us.
- Righto.</i>

01:54:59.411 --> 01:55:03.540
Sergeant Butterman,
little hand says it's time to rock and roll.

01:55:03.749 --> 01:55:05.334
Bring the noise.

02:00:54.006 --> 02:00:58.177
