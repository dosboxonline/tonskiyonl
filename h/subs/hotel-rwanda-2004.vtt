<i>The latest ceasefire came too late
to save these villages...</i>

00:23.495 --> 00:29.161
<i>Today President Clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...</i>

00:33.973 --> 00:38.171
<i>When people ask me, good listeners,
why do I hate all the Tutsi.</i>

00:38.243 --> 00:41.110
<i>I say. "Read our history."</i>

00:41.180 --> 00:44.115
<i>The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.</i>

00:44.183 --> 00:47.175
<i>They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.</i>

00:47.252 --> 00:50.346
<i>Now they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.</i>

00:50.422 --> 00:53.687
<i>They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.</i>

00:53.759 --> 00:58.355
<i>Rwanda is our Hutu land.
We are the majority.</i>

00:58.430 --> 01:01.957
<i>They are a minority of traitors
and invaders.</i>

01:02.034 --> 01:07.870
<i>We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.</i>

01:07.940 --> 01:11.432
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

01:11.510 --> 01:14.604
<i>Stay alert.
Watch your neighbors.</i>

01:34.033 --> 01:37.525
- Mr. Rusesabagina, thank you.
- Good to see you, sir.

01:49.782 --> 01:50.771
Thank you.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.249
These are for you, sir.
They're fresh from Havana.

01:53.318 --> 01:56.310
Wonderful. Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello.

01:57.189 --> 01:58.520
Good to see you gentlemen.

02:23.115 --> 02:25.675
That is a fine cigar, sir.

02:26.351 --> 02:28.080
This is a Cohiba cigar.

02:28.153 --> 02:32.089
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs.
- 10,000 francs?

02:32.157 --> 02:35.456
Yes, yes. But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs.

02:35.527 --> 02:37.154
What do you mean, sir?

02:39.865 --> 02:43.961
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

02:44.036 --> 02:47.972
He is rich.
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

02:48.040 --> 02:52.739
straight from Havana, Cuba...
Hey, that is style, Dube.

02:53.512 --> 02:54.604
Style.

03:04.556 --> 03:07.548
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar.

03:08.460 --> 03:09.757
The best, eh?

03:09.828 --> 03:12.490
So, you're going to join us
at the rally today?

03:15.067 --> 03:16.398
I will try my best, George,

03:16.468 --> 03:20.063
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics.

03:20.139 --> 03:23.540
Politics is power, Paul.
Hutu power.

03:23.609 --> 03:24.974
And money.

03:29.314 --> 03:31.475
It's time for you
to join your people.

03:33.018 --> 03:34.315
Thank you, George.

03:35.187 --> 03:37.178
But time is also money.

03:38.524 --> 03:41.357
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

03:41.426 --> 03:43.257
along with the regular order.

03:46.398 --> 03:49.060
- Business is good at the hotel.
- It is very good.

03:50.002 --> 03:52.266
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul.

03:59.011 --> 04:01.605
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

04:06.952 --> 04:09.443
- You, clean this up.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

04:09.521 --> 04:12.217
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg.

04:12.291 --> 04:15.055
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra.

04:15.127 --> 04:16.116
Thank you.

04:20.599 --> 04:24.194
A bargain buy from China--
ten cents each.

04:25.237 --> 04:27.637
You know, I'll get at least fifty.

04:28.307 --> 04:29.604
At least.

04:37.015 --> 04:39.575
George Rutaganda is a bad man.

04:39.651 --> 04:42.484
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis.

04:43.922 --> 04:46.982
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube.

04:47.059 --> 04:49.323
Their time is soon over.

04:49.394 --> 04:51.362
Anyway, this is business.

04:57.336 --> 05:00.965
- Oh, no. It's the hterhamwe.
- Do as they say. Pull over.

05:21.159 --> 05:23.218
No, no, sit up, Dube. Sit up.

05:23.295 --> 05:25.286
Smile, Dube. Don't attract
attention to yourself.

05:25.364 --> 05:29.266
Some of these men are my neighbors.
They know that I'm Tutsi.

05:29.334 --> 05:31.859
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube.

05:36.375 --> 05:39.173
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

05:39.244 --> 05:40.575
What are you doing here?

05:40.646 --> 05:44.343
No, no. Hutu power.
Hutu power, Hutu power!

05:45.784 --> 05:47.513
Okay. Yes!

05:51.823 --> 05:53.154
Get out of here.

06:01.466 --> 06:03.457
There's water coming from the box.

06:03.535 --> 06:05.696
Park here.
We'll go in the front.

06:09.141 --> 06:11.371
Gregoire, please help with this water.

06:12.577 --> 06:13.874
Gregoire!

06:13.946 --> 06:15.573
Deal with this right away.

06:15.647 --> 06:18.775
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla.
- You must contact our safari desk.

06:20.385 --> 06:22.717
Dube, this is the lobby.

06:22.788 --> 06:25.416
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir. It is an emergency.

06:29.227 --> 06:31.457
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir.

06:34.967 --> 06:37.060
Ten alive, twelve are dead.

06:39.604 --> 06:40.764
All right.

06:41.740 --> 06:43.571
But save the shells.

06:43.642 --> 06:45.132
Fill them with...

06:46.078 --> 06:49.241
...a stuffing.
The good meat and something local.

06:49.314 --> 06:53.080
- Cassava?
- And...the fish.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.346
- And tipali.
- Yes.

06:55.420 --> 06:59.186
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust."

06:59.257 --> 07:00.246
Dube.

07:00.325 --> 07:01.724
Style, sir.

07:01.793 --> 07:03.260
Yes, sir.

07:06.098 --> 07:10.194
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

07:10.268 --> 07:15.467
that the hterhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement.

07:15.540 --> 07:19.101
Colonel, the U.N. need not worry
about the hterhamwe.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.405
We will control them.

07:20.479 --> 07:22.640
- General.
- Paul.

07:22.714 --> 07:24.807
This scotch is exceptional.

07:24.883 --> 07:28.649
It is our most popular single malt.
I knew you'd like it.

07:28.720 --> 07:30.585
Colonel Oliver,
it is a pleasure to see you, sir.

07:30.655 --> 07:32.646
Good to see you, Paul.

07:33.258 --> 07:36.250
General, let me recommend
the lobster for lunch today.

07:36.328 --> 07:38.296
It is spectacular--
straight off the plane.

07:38.363 --> 07:41.264
Fresh lobster in Kigali.
You do us proud, Paul.

07:41.333 --> 07:42.322
Thank you.

07:42.401 --> 07:45.302
I left a little something for you
at the coat check.

07:46.405 --> 07:47.804
Excuse me, gentlemen.

07:49.975 --> 07:52.205
I need flour.
Give me two bags of flour.

07:53.745 --> 07:55.838
Okay, the plates are ready.
Here they come.

07:58.283 --> 07:59.944
Good afternoon, ladies.

08:00.018 --> 08:02.578
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase.

08:02.654 --> 08:03.951
Yes, sir.

08:05.757 --> 08:07.349
<i>This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.</i>

08:07.926 --> 08:10.724
<i>I have a message for our president.</i>

08:10.796 --> 08:14.698
<i>Beware. Do not trust
the Tutsi rebels.</i>

08:14.766 --> 08:17.291
<i>Do not shake the hand
that will stab you.</i>

08:17.369 --> 08:18.631
<i>They will treat you...</i>

08:19.538 --> 08:22.473
<i>...reporting from Kigali, Rwanda,

08:22.541 --> 08:25.704

Hello, Mr. Paul.

08:45.163 --> 08:46.721
Hello, Jeremiah.

08:47.232 --> 08:48.392
Hello, sir.

08:53.805 --> 08:55.864
- Good to see you, Paul.
- Odette.

08:57.609 --> 08:59.099
See you soon.

09:01.079 --> 09:03.138
So your brother
and the girls are here.

09:03.215 --> 09:04.409
Yes.

09:05.617 --> 09:06.641
One, two, three...

09:06.718 --> 09:08.583
Oh, Carine!

09:09.254 --> 09:11.222
Okay, Anais, let me see.
Your turn.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.722
One, two, three...

09:14.926 --> 09:17.690
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter.

09:17.762 --> 09:19.525
I have chocolates.
Who wants chocolates?

09:19.598 --> 09:20.724
Hey, Papa, watch this.

09:24.002 --> 09:27.199
Oh, my goodness. Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates. Who wants?

09:27.772 --> 09:29.967
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul.

09:30.041 --> 09:33.135
- Please, not before dinner.
- Not before dinner, Mama says.

09:33.211 --> 09:35.338
- Thank you.
- Okay, okay.

09:35.413 --> 09:36.675
Let's go in.

09:42.921 --> 09:46.084
Things are very slow at the shop.
How are things at the hotel?

09:46.158 --> 09:49.321
Very busy.
Many people visiting the gorillas.

09:49.394 --> 09:52.192
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

09:52.264 --> 09:54.789
- What?
- There are soldiers.

09:54.866 --> 09:57.426
- Where?
- On the street.

10:01.506 --> 10:04.339
I'll go see what's happening.
It's all right.

10:07.245 --> 10:11.238
- We know you are Tutsi.
- Please, sir, this is my husband.

10:11.316 --> 10:13.716
- He's just a gardener.
- He's been spying for the rebels.

10:13.785 --> 10:16.549
- No, we do not know any rebels.
- You will come with us!

10:16.621 --> 10:19.647
No, we are telling the truth.
We do not know any...

10:20.525 --> 10:21.958
- What is it?
- Shut up!

10:22.027 --> 10:24.689
Tatiana, go back in the house.
You must go back.

10:24.763 --> 10:26.731
- You mustn't be out here.
- It's Victor.

10:29.601 --> 10:31.660
No, Captain, you see--

10:31.736 --> 10:34.864
It's not me. It's not me.
Captain, Captain.

10:34.940 --> 10:37.500
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please.

10:37.576 --> 10:40.010
- I know, I know, but it's not me.
- You Tutsi fuckers.

10:41.179 --> 10:42.646
No! No!

10:42.714 --> 10:44.045
We must do something.

10:44.115 --> 10:45.810
- Do what?
- Call someone.

10:45.884 --> 10:48.785
I'm not going. I'm not going.

10:48.853 --> 10:49.877
No!

10:55.894 --> 10:58.089
Get him in the truck. Now!

10:59.197 --> 11:00.892
We must do something.

11:00.966 --> 11:03.025
Please help him!

11:03.101 --> 11:05.535
Oh, Victor!

11:06.104 --> 11:07.093
Victor!

11:07.172 --> 11:09.037
There is nothing we can do.

11:10.075 --> 11:12.908
- You must stay the night, Thomas.
- Yes.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.711
No!

11:19.551 --> 11:21.610
Why would they arrest Victor?

11:23.855 --> 11:25.720
He has no politics.

11:26.558 --> 11:29.322
- He's a gardener.
- Who knows, Tatsi?

11:30.495 --> 11:31.655
Who knows?

11:32.230 --> 11:35.631
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy.

11:36.968 --> 11:38.697
Happens all the time now.

11:40.639 --> 11:45.667
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army.

11:46.411 --> 11:47.935
It wouldn't help.

11:49.547 --> 11:51.344
You could ask as a favor.

11:51.416 --> 11:53.577
No, I could not.

11:54.919 --> 11:59.720
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

11:59.791 --> 12:03.659
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favors

12:03.728 --> 12:06.356
<i>so if there is a time
when we need help,</i>

12:06.431 --> 12:08.490
I have powerful people
I can call upon.

12:08.566 --> 12:10.898
But Victor was a good neighbor.

12:10.969 --> 12:15.269
He is not family.
Family is all that matters.

12:15.974 --> 12:21.139
Please, please,
leave these things to my good judgment.

12:36.928 --> 12:39.260
This assignment is bullshit.

12:39.331 --> 12:42.391
Come on. A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

12:44.669 --> 12:48.070
Gentlemen, welcome
to the Mille Collines.

12:48.139 --> 12:50.369
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

12:50.442 --> 12:52.273
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you.

12:52.344 --> 12:54.539
Anything that you need,
please find me.

12:54.612 --> 12:55.977
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

13:03.555 --> 13:07.616
So, what is the actual difference
between a Hutu and a Tutsi?

13:07.692 --> 13:12.095
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant.

13:12.163 --> 13:15.132
It was the Belgians
that created the division.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.690
How?

13:16.768 --> 13:20.101
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin.

13:20.171 --> 13:22.230
They used to measure
the width of people's noses.

13:22.307 --> 13:24.832
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country.

13:24.909 --> 13:27.241
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

13:27.312 --> 13:29.576
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

13:29.647 --> 13:31.911
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression.

13:31.983 --> 13:33.780
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

13:33.852 --> 13:37.185
Yes, unfortunately.
Please take this to the general.

13:38.356 --> 13:41.553
Benedict is our finest journalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subject.

13:43.261 --> 13:44.626
So what are you, Paul?

13:47.298 --> 13:48.526
I am Hutu.

13:49.434 --> 13:50.594
Gentlemen.

13:50.668 --> 13:55.230
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice.

13:55.306 --> 13:58.605
Excuse me, honey.
Can I ask you a personal question?

13:58.676 --> 14:03.113
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi.

14:03.181 --> 14:07.015
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu.

14:09.754 --> 14:11.085
They could be twins.

14:11.656 --> 14:14.819
Get the camera.
The general's going to give us an interview.

14:14.893 --> 14:15.882
Okay.

14:17.262 --> 14:21.164
I'm in room 22. I'd love
to finish up this conversation.

14:24.035 --> 14:28.131
<i>Senior U.N. officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training</i>

14:28.206 --> 14:31.471
<i>and arming the Hutu militia
called the hterhamwe.</i>

14:31.543 --> 14:35.980
<i>I put this claim to the head
of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.</i>

14:36.047 --> 14:39.744
<i>No. No, we have not been
training the militia.</i>

14:39.818 --> 14:41.809
<i>The U.N. are mistaken
in this accusation.</i>

14:41.886 --> 14:44.480
<i>Do you support your president's
agreement to make peace with the rebels?</i>

14:44.556 --> 14:48.014
<i>The president has
the full support of the army.</i>

14:48.092 --> 14:51.084
<i>That peace agreement will
be signed today in Tanzania</i>

14:51.162 --> 14:54.529
<i>between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyarimana.</i>

14:54.599 --> 14:57.397
This is a great day for Rwanda

14:57.469 --> 14:59.403
and for all of Africa.

14:59.471 --> 15:02.133
Negotiation has replaced confrontation...

15:02.207 --> 15:04.675
Paul, have a drink.

15:04.742 --> 15:06.573
Friendship has replaced fear.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.908
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

15:08.980 --> 15:10.845
to the signing
of the peace agreement.

15:10.915 --> 15:14.373
To our president.
May he find peace.

15:15.386 --> 15:17.115
May we all find peace.

15:17.188 --> 15:22.888
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord.

15:22.961 --> 15:24.223
To peace!

15:24.295 --> 15:25.421
Peace!

15:27.632 --> 15:31.033
- Look me up if you come over.
- Yes, it is a beautiful city.

15:31.102 --> 15:33.627
I am planning on returning there as--
Forgive me.

15:33.705 --> 15:35.798
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thomas.

15:38.042 --> 15:39.907
- Hello, Fedens.
- Paul.

15:40.478 --> 15:42.173
Well, this is a surprise.

15:42.247 --> 15:44.647
Forgive us, Paul.
We must talk.

15:45.517 --> 15:47.485
Yes, what's wrong?

15:47.552 --> 15:50.385
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul.

15:50.455 --> 15:51.581
Who?

15:53.024 --> 15:54.491
Thank you, Sullivan.

15:56.394 --> 16:00.160
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man.

16:00.231 --> 16:03.291
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad.

16:04.469 --> 16:05.902
Give me this man's name.

16:05.970 --> 16:09.565
Please, Paul, even though
he is hterhamwe, he's a friend.

16:09.641 --> 16:11.438
He wants your job, Thomas.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.711
He said that
there is a signal.

16:19.884 --> 16:22.409
It is "Cut the tall trees."

16:23.254 --> 16:26.246
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war.

16:26.324 --> 16:30.260
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.296
You are Hutu.
You will be safe.

16:33.498 --> 16:37.400
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things.

16:38.369 --> 16:40.360
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas.

16:40.438 --> 16:43.168
But please, the United Nations
are here now.

16:43.241 --> 16:45.801
The world press are watching.

16:45.877 --> 16:48.710
The peace has been signed.
Let this process work--

16:48.780 --> 16:50.338
What was that?

16:54.586 --> 16:55.917
Power cuts.

16:57.221 --> 16:59.416
We are running on generators.

17:00.425 --> 17:02.359
Fedens...

17:02.427 --> 17:04.054
Please, don't worry.

17:06.030 --> 17:09.965
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana.

17:10.034 --> 17:11.365
All right?

17:14.005 --> 17:17.065
- Good night, Paul.
- Yes. Kiss the girls for me.

17:45.570 --> 17:46.867
Shit!

18:01.019 --> 18:03.988
Stay in your houses.
Stay in your house.

18:04.055 --> 18:06.182
Everybody stay in your house!

18:37.855 --> 18:39.015
Tatiana?

19:08.920 --> 19:11.115
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

19:12.724 --> 19:15.386
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned.

19:15.927 --> 19:18.293
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

19:18.362 --> 19:21.661
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.530
Tutsi rebels have killed him.

19:23.601 --> 19:27.059
Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

19:30.341 --> 19:33.071
Everyone, please,
out of this room. Please.

19:33.144 --> 19:35.135
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room.

19:35.213 --> 19:37.010
Odette, please.

19:40.384 --> 19:44.514
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes. I told them to go home.

19:45.523 --> 19:49.084
- Go and call them, Tatsi.
- I've tried. Our phones, they do not work.

19:53.498 --> 19:57.457
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust.

19:57.535 --> 19:59.127
You are a Tutsi.

19:59.203 --> 20:02.502
They are scared, Paul.
I am scared.

20:08.813 --> 20:11.646
These are probably rumors
started by agitators.

20:11.716 --> 20:14.549
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi. We must.

20:15.052 --> 20:18.579
Forgive me, Paul.
Elys says that Roger has gone.

20:18.656 --> 20:20.920
Gone? Gone where?

20:20.992 --> 20:24.689
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama.
- Where has he gone, Elys?

20:24.762 --> 20:25.888
He went next door.

20:26.798 --> 20:28.629
Wait. Paul!

20:28.699 --> 20:31.725
Tatiana, no. You have to
stay here with the children.

20:31.803 --> 20:33.703
- Stay in the house. No!
- Please.

20:41.579 --> 20:45.071
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

20:45.149 --> 20:48.118
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

20:48.186 --> 20:50.313
Talk to me.
Where are you hurt?

20:50.388 --> 20:51.446
Paul?

20:54.091 --> 20:55.251
Oh, Tatsi.

20:57.628 --> 20:59.619
Odette, Odette!

20:59.697 --> 21:00.686
Oh, no.

21:00.765 --> 21:02.198
I'm okay.

21:02.266 --> 21:04.666
Get his clothes off.
Tatsi, please get some water.

21:04.735 --> 21:06.965
- He's hurt.
- Please, let's get his clothes off.

21:07.038 --> 21:09.438
- He's covered in blood.
- Lay back, son.

21:11.209 --> 21:13.200
He went next door
to the Chirangas.

21:14.111 --> 21:15.840
Where is he hurt?

21:16.447 --> 21:18.506
Look here, Odette, look here.

21:18.583 --> 21:21.211
Stay still, Roger.
Keep him still, Paul.

21:22.053 --> 21:24.613
- I can't find the wound.
- What happened to you?

21:24.689 --> 21:26.088
- Tell your mother.
- Talk to me.

21:26.157 --> 21:28.318
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger.

21:28.392 --> 21:29.825
Roger, you're okay.

21:29.894 --> 21:33.660
Do not worry, he is not cut.
He is not hurt.

21:33.731 --> 21:36.165
This is not his blood, Paul.

21:37.501 --> 21:38.832
You are not hurt.

21:38.903 --> 21:42.361
My darling, it's okay.
It's okay.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.305
You are safe.
Look at your mother.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.434
Come here, Elys.

21:46.510 --> 21:50.002
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

21:50.915 --> 21:52.849
- You are safe.
- You are out, Roger.

21:52.917 --> 21:55.647
You are safe, you are safe, Roger.
You are safe, Roger.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.415
It's okay.

21:57.488 --> 21:59.649
I love you so much.
I love you.

22:19.543 --> 22:20.805
Oh, son.

22:25.316 --> 22:26.715
Paul.

22:26.784 --> 22:32.313
<i>Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.
Terrible news...</i>

22:32.390 --> 22:35.382
<i>- It is true.
- Horrible news...</i>

22:35.459 --> 22:40.158
<i>Our great president
is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.</i>

22:40.231 --> 22:41.220
Oh, my God!

22:41.299 --> 22:45.133
<i>They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.</i>

22:45.202 --> 22:47.830
<i>Then they shot his plane
from the sky.</i>

22:48.806 --> 22:53.175
<i>It is time to clear the brush,
good Hutus of Rwanda.</i>

22:54.278 --> 22:57.111
<i>We must cut the tall trees.</i>

22:57.782 --> 23:00.615
<i>Cut the tall trees now!</i>

23:00.685 --> 23:02.175
The soldiers are here!

23:02.253 --> 23:05.222
<i>- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.
- No, no.</i>

23:05.289 --> 23:07.849
Everyone, stay calm.
Stay calm and be quiet.

23:07.925 --> 23:12.385
<i>Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.</i>

23:13.297 --> 23:16.027
Split up.
Everybody out.

23:18.135 --> 23:20.603
- You two, check the back.
- Go.

23:22.340 --> 23:24.706
- You, go and find him.
- Yes, sir.

23:30.982 --> 23:32.950
I better go have a word with them.

23:34.352 --> 23:37.014
Go around the back.
Make sure no one comes out.

23:37.088 --> 23:38.112
Yes, sir!

23:39.690 --> 23:41.885
Who's in charge here?

23:41.959 --> 23:43.119
You.

23:49.066 --> 23:51.967
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

23:52.036 --> 23:54.937
- Let me see your identity card.
- Grab your things. Go!

23:55.006 --> 23:57.065
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu.

23:57.141 --> 23:58.233
Get out!

24:01.846 --> 24:03.746
Get out of here!

24:03.814 --> 24:06.214
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

24:06.283 --> 24:07.807
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

24:09.420 --> 24:11.149
No, I work at the Mille Collines.

24:12.823 --> 24:14.654
I used to work at the Diplomat.

24:14.725 --> 24:17.455
We want to use that hotel.
All the room keys are in the safe.

24:17.528 --> 24:19.962
You must open it.
Let's go.

24:20.031 --> 24:23.592
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.363
I must take them with me.
It is not safe here.

24:26.437 --> 24:28.632
There are Tutsi spies everywhere.

24:28.706 --> 24:30.333
I cannot take all these people.

24:30.408 --> 24:32.399
No, no, sir,
you do not have to.

24:32.476 --> 24:35.274
We have our car
and our van.

24:35.346 --> 24:38.042
<i>- Captain Kaliso, come on.
- Roger.</i>

24:38.549 --> 24:42.576
- Let's go!
- Come on. Hurry! Go around, go around.

24:42.653 --> 24:44.951
We found him.
Let's go. Let's go!

24:46.390 --> 24:49.723
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah. Hurry.

25:00.037 --> 25:01.561
Oh, Jesus, no!

25:03.507 --> 25:04.997
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

25:06.110 --> 25:09.273
Don't look, don't look, don't look.
Don't look, Tatiana.

26:13.677 --> 26:16.578
- The safe is in the manager's office.
- You two, go with him.

26:24.922 --> 26:27.288
Look at this. Beer.

26:44.441 --> 26:45.703
I've got them.

26:57.388 --> 26:58.878
Get down, all of you!

27:04.795 --> 27:08.788
Sir, sir. Here, I have them.
I have them. I've got them.

27:13.470 --> 27:15.301
Traitor!

27:15.372 --> 27:17.340
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

27:18.008 --> 27:20.442
Let me explain, sir.
Please wait.

27:23.747 --> 27:24.907
Shoot them.

27:26.283 --> 27:27.511
Shoot them.

27:29.353 --> 27:32.948
Please, I don't use guns.
I don't.

27:33.023 --> 27:34.012
It's easy.

27:38.996 --> 27:42.329
Shoot them, or you die first.

27:43.200 --> 27:46.931
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

27:47.004 --> 27:48.835
You wanna pay me?

27:48.906 --> 27:51.306
Why not?
Look at them.

27:51.375 --> 27:53.172
These are not rebels.

27:54.178 --> 27:57.636
Soon they will be worthless to you.
Why not take some money for your work?

27:57.715 --> 28:00.343
- How much?
- You name a price.

28:08.158 --> 28:09.921
10,000 francs for each.

28:10.828 --> 28:13.490
- Sir, I don't have that much.
- Okay.

28:13.564 --> 28:15.532
Wait, wait! Here.

28:15.599 --> 28:19.035
It's 1,000 U.S.
And here.

28:19.737 --> 28:22.570
50,000 francs for my wife and children.

28:22.640 --> 28:24.870
- Take them.
- Go, go, go.

28:24.942 --> 28:27.342
Go, go, go.

28:27.411 --> 28:29.311
- Have you any money?
- Nothing.

28:29.380 --> 28:32.611
- Paul, don't let them die.
- Get in the van.

28:37.688 --> 28:40.521
Sir, I have more money actually.

28:42.459 --> 28:45.758
And let them give you something.
Some money, whatever they have.

28:45.829 --> 28:46.989
All right?

28:48.499 --> 28:50.694
Here you are.
Give me everything you have.

28:52.870 --> 28:54.701
Here, Paul, it's all I have.

28:57.675 --> 28:59.870
Here you are. See?

29:01.779 --> 29:04.771
This is enough for one cockroach.
Pick one.

29:06.417 --> 29:07.577
Sir...

29:09.753 --> 29:13.086
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them.

29:15.092 --> 29:17.026
- Give me it.
- I don't have it here.

29:17.094 --> 29:19.085
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you.

29:19.163 --> 29:21.631
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U.N.

29:21.699 --> 29:26.363
Sir, I swear.
100,000 francs.

29:26.437 --> 29:29.964
I will get you the money.
You keep them outside.

29:32.576 --> 29:34.737
Please, sir. Please.

29:36.146 --> 29:38.637
- Let's go.
- Okay. Everyone in the van.

29:38.716 --> 29:40.513
Come on now. Hurry.

29:52.229 --> 29:56.029
Go with my soldiers. And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches.

30:00.671 --> 30:03.435
The soldiers are here.
Where is the car?

30:03.507 --> 30:06.840
There is nothing I can do.
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you--

30:19.223 --> 30:20.554
Here's the money.

30:20.624 --> 30:23.115
100,000 francs as promised.

30:23.193 --> 30:25.161
Now please, let them go, sir.

30:25.229 --> 30:27.459
Take the money.
We will get them later.

30:30.334 --> 30:32.495
- You can go.
- Thank you.

30:34.538 --> 30:35.698
Traitor.

30:40.310 --> 30:41.572
Thank you, Paul.

30:47.050 --> 30:49.917
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul.

30:49.987 --> 30:52.353
- You must tell him when he comes--
- Here he is, sir.

30:53.857 --> 30:57.918
Paul, I have to go.
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled.

30:57.995 --> 31:00.964
I have to close up there.
You are in charge now.

31:01.031 --> 31:02.157
It's okay, it's okay.

31:02.232 --> 31:05.998
<i>There were no survivors in last night's
plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.</i>

31:06.069 --> 31:08.902
Everyone, please move to the side.
Clear the door.

31:08.972 --> 31:10.303
Come, Tatsi.

31:12.643 --> 31:14.873
Andre, I need two suites.

31:14.945 --> 31:17.243
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand.

31:17.314 --> 31:21.512
- I need to get hold of my embassy.
- If you give me one moment, please.

31:22.886 --> 31:26.549
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room.
- What about our neighbors?

31:27.791 --> 31:29.281
What will they do?

31:31.862 --> 31:34.194
- Dube.
- Yes, sir?

31:35.899 --> 31:40.233
Please...put these "guests"
in two staff rooms.

31:40.304 --> 31:41.771
Right away, sir.

31:50.514 --> 31:53.608
No, no, no. Please, it's old.
Have the fruit.

31:57.521 --> 32:00.183
It's all right, Roger.
It's all right. We're here.

32:01.458 --> 32:03.119
- Ah, Joseph.
- Your suit, sir.

32:03.193 --> 32:04.558
This mess is unacceptable.

32:04.628 --> 32:07.688
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away. Thank you.

32:09.733 --> 32:11.997
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens.
- All right.

32:14.705 --> 32:17.196
Operator, I need a line.

32:17.274 --> 32:20.141
I need a line now. Please. Hello?

32:24.948 --> 32:27.109
You did not reach them?

32:27.184 --> 32:29.379
No. No answer.

32:30.888 --> 32:34.551
<i>It is a very tense situation,
and I just want to assure the families</i>

32:34.625 --> 32:37.753
<i>of those who are there that we are
doing everything we possibly can</i>

32:37.828 --> 32:40.388
<i>to try to ensure
the safety of our citizens there.</i>

32:40.464 --> 32:42.694
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

32:42.766 --> 32:45.462
We are calling the airport.
We are calling the embassy.

32:45.536 --> 32:48.096
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can.

32:48.171 --> 32:50.071
- And yes, your passport, yes.
- And my passport.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.472
Antoinette will take care
of this for you.

32:54.344 --> 32:56.744
Dube, where is Gregoire?

32:59.216 --> 33:02.617
Sir, he has moved
into the Presidential Suite.

33:17.301 --> 33:18.461
Mr. Manager.

33:20.370 --> 33:22.429
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

33:22.506 --> 33:23.871
Who is it?

33:24.608 --> 33:26.075
It's okay, darling.

33:26.877 --> 33:28.208
What do you want?

33:28.278 --> 33:31.805
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away.

33:31.882 --> 33:35.147
- I don't have to listen to you anymore.
- Yes, you do.

33:35.218 --> 33:38.415
I am in charge. Now get out
of this room right now.

33:44.461 --> 33:49.057
Mr. Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

33:50.567 --> 33:53.627
If I were to leave this room,
I'm sure I could find it.

33:54.404 --> 33:56.895
And I know people
who can cleanse it.

33:58.141 --> 34:01.872
But maybe it doesn't bother you.
Why is that?

34:03.246 --> 34:05.077
Are you used to the smell?

34:06.650 --> 34:07.981
Well, not me.

34:08.985 --> 34:11.318
I need a clean room
to escape it.

34:17.594 --> 34:21.360
Please move into the hotel.
Everyone, keep moving.

34:21.431 --> 34:23.728
My house has been burned.
I have nowhere to go.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.391
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor.

34:25.469 --> 34:27.699
But we are operating
at capacity as it is.

34:27.771 --> 34:31.605
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it. I'm sorry.

34:31.675 --> 34:34.303
- There's no way we can share.
- I am sorry. Forgive me.

34:34.378 --> 34:35.844
There are eight of us.

34:35.911 --> 34:37.469
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.706
Yes, Madame Archer.

34:46.156 --> 34:49.023
They're Tutsi children
from the St. Francis orphanage.

34:49.592 --> 34:51.254
Okay, come on, let's go.

34:51.928 --> 34:54.795
- I have only one room.
- That'll do.

34:57.134 --> 34:58.567
Come.

34:58.635 --> 35:01.035
- Otto, please.
- Excuse me.

35:02.105 --> 35:05.074
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly.

35:07.778 --> 35:11.179
- Have to go get the rest of them.
- The rest of them?

35:11.248 --> 35:13.614
There are another ten.
I'll be back soon.

35:16.186 --> 35:18.120
Madame Archer.

35:18.188 --> 35:19.951
I have a favor to ask of you.

35:20.023 --> 35:23.550
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St. Francis.

35:23.627 --> 35:25.720
On O'Clare, 20.

35:25.796 --> 35:28.788
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

35:28.865 --> 35:30.890
- Sure.
- And I have a photo.

35:32.903 --> 35:34.598
Please, keep moving!

35:38.308 --> 35:39.969
- Thanks, Paul.
- Thank you.

35:40.043 --> 35:41.908
Please move into the hotel!

35:41.978 --> 35:43.605
Come on, kids, don't be afraid.

35:43.680 --> 35:46.376
- Take them around the back.
- Everyone, keep moving!

35:52.289 --> 35:54.689
Has he spoken to you yet?

35:54.758 --> 35:55.747
No.

36:09.506 --> 36:11.531
Is your face still hurting?

36:12.576 --> 36:13.736
It's all right.

36:20.283 --> 36:23.013
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness.

36:25.756 --> 36:27.815
I shouldn't have brought them here.

36:29.826 --> 36:33.159
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

36:33.230 --> 36:36.063
was to never, never lower
the tone of the hotel.

36:37.467 --> 36:40.368
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul."

36:45.175 --> 36:47.166
Soon all of this will be over.

36:49.679 --> 36:51.840
What if I lose my job, Tatsi?

36:54.818 --> 36:55.876
Oh, my God!

36:55.952 --> 36:58.147
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

37:18.241 --> 37:20.175
Take care of them.

37:20.243 --> 37:21.574
How, sir?

37:22.913 --> 37:25.404
Bathe them, feed them.

37:26.817 --> 37:28.148
Put them to bed.

37:31.254 --> 37:32.915
I will send you some help.

37:37.794 --> 37:39.523
Okay, babies.

37:39.863 --> 37:42.127
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres.

37:42.199 --> 37:44.690
Will the U.N. intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

37:44.768 --> 37:47.896
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers.

37:47.971 --> 37:50.599
My orders are
not to intervene.

37:51.575 --> 37:53.475
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, Colonel.

37:54.177 --> 37:55.269
Here. Over here.

37:55.345 --> 37:58.473
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now.

37:59.216 --> 38:00.808
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack.

38:00.884 --> 38:04.285
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls. We gotta cover it.

38:04.354 --> 38:07.482
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car.

38:07.557 --> 38:09.718
- That's the ground rules.
- The ground rules?

38:09.793 --> 38:11.624
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

38:11.695 --> 38:16.689
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack.

38:16.766 --> 38:19.200
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees.

38:24.908 --> 38:26.136
Let's go.

38:26.209 --> 38:28.837
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people.

38:28.912 --> 38:31.779
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is.

38:31.848 --> 38:35.284
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross.

38:35.352 --> 38:37.411
This is not a refugee camp.

38:37.487 --> 38:39.682
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

38:39.756 --> 38:43.021
No, I can't do that, Paul.
I'm sorry.

38:43.927 --> 38:46.657
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp.

38:46.730 --> 38:49.324
I'm under attack, constant attack.

38:49.399 --> 38:53.301
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em.

38:56.239 --> 39:00.938
<i>...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.</i>

39:01.011 --> 39:05.539
<i>The Tutsi cockroach judge
called Makesa is hiding at 4...</i>

39:08.184 --> 39:12.518
<i>- ...Kabulla and his cockroaches...
- Turn that radio off.</i>

39:13.323 --> 39:15.018
<i>Watch out for him. He--</i>

39:17.427 --> 39:21.193
And get back to work.
We have a hotel to run.

39:21.264 --> 39:24.461
There's no work here anyway.
The boss has left.

39:24.534 --> 39:26.229
I am your boss!

39:39.649 --> 39:43.642
<i>Sir, there's a call from the Mille Collines
in Rwanda on line one.</i>

39:43.720 --> 39:46.280
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

39:46.990 --> 39:50.551
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager.

39:50.627 --> 39:52.720
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr. Tillens.

39:52.796 --> 39:55.560
Ah, yes. Paul, I remember.

39:55.632 --> 39:57.395
How are things there?

39:57.467 --> 39:59.765
<i>The situation is difficult, sir.</i>

40:01.137 --> 40:05.301
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

40:05.375 --> 40:07.400
until this unrest is over.

40:07.477 --> 40:11.106
<i>I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?</i>

40:13.616 --> 40:17.848
Sir, that would be
very bad for our reputation.

40:17.921 --> 40:22.187
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers.

40:22.258 --> 40:25.489
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

40:25.562 --> 40:28.656
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir.

40:30.166 --> 40:32.066
Very well, Paul.
Very well.

40:32.135 --> 40:36.071
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close.

40:36.139 --> 40:39.438
If there is anything
I can do, please call.

40:40.076 --> 40:43.568
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away.

40:44.914 --> 40:48.509
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this.

40:49.319 --> 40:53.483
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years.

40:54.624 --> 40:58.617
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

40:58.695 --> 41:00.424
for you to perform your duties?

41:05.001 --> 41:07.993
In fact, forget this letter.

41:08.071 --> 41:12.132
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now.

41:17.380 --> 41:20.975
Please, everyone, back to work.

41:26.756 --> 41:28.815
Paul, thank you for coming.

41:28.892 --> 41:32.419
The air conditioner's on the blink. Is
there any way you can have a look at it?

41:32.495 --> 41:34.360
- I'm just on a deadline.
- Certainly.

41:34.431 --> 41:38.629
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed. Thanks.

41:39.235 --> 41:43.194
Mr. Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir.

41:43.273 --> 41:44.706
Thank you, Paul.

41:45.975 --> 41:48.273
You're an oasis in the desert.

41:49.679 --> 41:51.840
<i>...the elements of
the government and army</i>

41:51.915 --> 41:55.646
<i>are following the example of what
happened to the Americans in Somalia.</i>

41:55.718 --> 42:01.588
<i>I think they intend to intimidate us,
try to attack us, and...</i>

42:01.658 --> 42:05.287
<i>hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.</i>

42:05.361 --> 42:07.761
<i>- Do you think they'll succeed?
- No, they won't.</i>

42:07.831 --> 42:09.230
<i>The U.N.'s here to stay.</i>

42:09.299 --> 42:10.960
<i>What about
the outbreak of violence</i>

42:11.034 --> 42:13.002
<i>since the shooting down
of the president's plane?</i>

42:13.069 --> 42:15.867
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

42:15.939 --> 42:18.999
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew.

42:21.578 --> 42:22.875
What is this?

42:52.976 --> 42:55.809
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road.

42:56.412 --> 42:58.209
Fred, it's David.

42:58.281 --> 43:01.114
I've got incredible footage.
It's a massacre.

43:01.184 --> 43:03.880
Dead bodies, machetes.

43:03.953 --> 43:07.081
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

43:08.057 --> 43:09.149
Yeah.

43:14.430 --> 43:16.125
You have to lead with this.

43:17.367 --> 43:19.426
I point at you, you do a shot.

43:19.502 --> 43:23.495
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking--

43:23.573 --> 43:25.598
- Excuse me, Mr. Daglish.
- Hey, Paul.

43:26.376 --> 43:29.436
Listen, sorry about earlier.

43:29.512 --> 43:32.140
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have--

43:32.215 --> 43:37.016
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it.

43:37.086 --> 43:40.180
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene.

43:43.459 --> 43:47.793
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,
is it still a good thing to show?

43:49.566 --> 43:53.502
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

43:53.570 --> 43:57.939
I think if people see this footage...

43:59.042 --> 44:01.636
...they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

44:01.711 --> 44:03.542
and then go on
eating their dinners.

44:08.284 --> 44:11.447
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna just relax?

44:11.521 --> 44:14.183
I have more work to do.
I thank you for your offer.

44:14.257 --> 44:16.487
Please enjoy your evening,
Mr. Daglish.

44:20.530 --> 44:23.465
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

44:23.533 --> 44:25.558
We've got trouble at the gate.

44:28.304 --> 44:30.932
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

44:31.007 --> 44:34.204
That group, come with me.
Move out of the area.

44:34.277 --> 44:36.507
- Here, get up, get up.
- Right, fall back, everybody.

44:37.614 --> 44:39.605
Benedict, what is happening?

44:39.682 --> 44:42.617
They're killing everyone.
The lady...

44:42.685 --> 44:45.449
The hterhamwe have surrounded
the whole town.

44:45.521 --> 44:46.681
Come on!

44:47.223 --> 44:49.214
Cover the road. Now.

44:50.093 --> 44:51.651
Stand your ground.

44:53.563 --> 44:54.621
Hold the line.

44:54.697 --> 44:57.063
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

45:23.593 --> 45:26.255
- Lieutenant, guard this gate.
- Yes, sir.

45:26.763 --> 45:29.732
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags.

45:29.799 --> 45:34.964
They murdered my men.
I lost ten Belgian U.N. soldiers.

45:35.038 --> 45:37.472
They were protecting
the lady prime minister.

45:37.540 --> 45:39.667
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead.

45:41.077 --> 45:44.672
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force.

45:44.747 --> 45:46.237
They'll be here in a few days.

45:46.316 --> 45:50.013
I understand that, Colonel, but there is
simply no place for me to put all of them.

45:50.086 --> 45:51.451
What can I do?

45:51.521 --> 45:54.888
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants.

45:55.725 --> 45:57.124
- All right.
- All right.

45:57.193 --> 45:58.990
I understand. Thank you.

46:08.805 --> 46:10.067
Madame Archer.

46:11.341 --> 46:12.433
Hello.

46:13.576 --> 46:16.739
- We were expecting you five days ago.
- I'm sorry.

46:16.813 --> 46:19.304
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

46:19.382 --> 46:22.112
I made it to the house,
but it was empty.

46:22.185 --> 46:24.745
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked.

46:25.988 --> 46:29.151
As I left, an old woman,
she waved to me.

46:29.225 --> 46:33.252
I went to the house. She has
the two little girls. They're safe.

46:33.329 --> 46:34.887
Okay.

46:34.964 --> 46:36.727
But...

46:36.799 --> 46:41.202
My brother and his wife--
did the old lady know of them?

46:44.407 --> 46:48.343
My brother is dead.
They would never leave their children.

46:48.411 --> 46:51.938
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana. They are hiding.

46:53.483 --> 46:56.509
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

46:56.586 --> 47:00.317
I can't. There are
hterhamwe roadblocks everywhere.

47:04.060 --> 47:06.051
When I reached the orphanage...

47:07.330 --> 47:09.264
...the hterhamwe were there.

47:10.233 --> 47:13.066
They'd already started
killing children.

47:13.803 --> 47:15.464
They made me watch.

47:18.408 --> 47:20.399
There was one girl,

47:20.476 --> 47:23.104
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back.

47:26.983 --> 47:30.077
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me.

47:32.588 --> 47:34.579
"Please don't let them kill me.

47:35.858 --> 47:38.520
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore."

47:38.594 --> 47:41.358
Please, I can't.

47:48.738 --> 47:52.902
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation.

48:01.317 --> 48:04.480
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul.

48:04.554 --> 48:09.014
Don't worry. There will be
an intervention force coming soon.

48:10.059 --> 48:12.186
We will get the orphans out then.

48:25.174 --> 48:26.436
They're here!

48:32.315 --> 48:35.182
They're here! We are safe!

48:35.251 --> 48:36.582
Soldiers have arrived!

48:37.186 --> 48:39.848
- Wow, look, it's the French!
- Yes!

48:39.922 --> 48:41.753
Thank goodness!

48:43.259 --> 48:45.193
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

48:45.261 --> 48:46.421
Well done.

48:49.866 --> 48:51.333
About time, gentlemen.

48:52.635 --> 48:54.535
Thank you for saving our lives.

48:58.841 --> 49:00.103
It's okay, Roger.

49:02.378 --> 49:06.212
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered. Thank God.

49:06.282 --> 49:08.045
Yes, finally!

49:10.319 --> 49:11.718
See, it's okay.

49:14.056 --> 49:16.286
We can do nothing
from our side.

49:19.495 --> 49:22.157
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe.

49:22.231 --> 49:25.029
See? I told you. Yeah.

49:27.036 --> 49:30.301
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

49:32.508 --> 49:33.668
Something strong.

49:34.377 --> 49:35.742
- Scotch?
- Yeah.

49:39.015 --> 49:40.778
Congratulations, Colonel.

49:42.051 --> 49:44.110
You have performed a minor miracle.

49:46.322 --> 49:49.052
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir.

49:52.528 --> 49:54.462
You should spit in my face.

49:56.232 --> 49:57.859
Excuse me, Colonel?

49:57.934 --> 49:59.731
You're dirt.

50:02.471 --> 50:03.870
We think you're dirt, Paul.

50:05.474 --> 50:06.873
Who is "we"?

50:07.910 --> 50:11.243
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul.

50:11.314 --> 50:14.545
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung. You're worthless.

50:14.617 --> 50:17.142
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir.

50:17.219 --> 50:19.517
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul.

50:20.523 --> 50:22.354
You're the smartest man here.

50:23.326 --> 50:26.386
You got them all eating
out of your hands.

50:26.462 --> 50:30.364
You could own this freakin' hotel,
except for one thing--

50:30.433 --> 50:31.764
you're black.

50:33.336 --> 50:35.327
You're not even a nigger.

50:36.606 --> 50:38.198
You're an African.

50:43.779 --> 50:45.644
They're not gonna stay, Paul.

50:47.516 --> 50:49.677
They're not gonna stop this slaughter.

50:52.188 --> 50:53.314
Please.

50:53.990 --> 50:55.082
Got it.

50:57.193 --> 50:59.252
- Hello.
- Hello, Daddy.

51:00.763 --> 51:03.197
Elys, take Diane in the other room.

51:06.936 --> 51:08.665
What is it?

51:14.143 --> 51:15.804
All the whites are leaving.

51:16.879 --> 51:18.676
They are being evacuated.

51:19.782 --> 51:22.615
But...what about us?

51:23.319 --> 51:25.253
We have been abandoned.

51:25.321 --> 51:28.313
But the soldiers
will stop the killers.

51:28.391 --> 51:30.825
Listen. Listen to me, Tatsi. Listen.

51:30.893 --> 51:34.124
I said all the whites are leaving--
the French, the Italians,

51:34.196 --> 51:36.790
even the U.N. Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

51:39.535 --> 51:41.469
Who is left?

51:42.371 --> 51:43.736
I don't know.

51:44.940 --> 51:50.606
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U.N. peacekeepers for the whole country.

51:53.049 --> 51:55.711
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men.

51:56.952 --> 51:59.147
And they are not allowed to shoot.

52:04.994 --> 52:06.825
I am a fool.

52:06.896 --> 52:09.091
No. No, no.

52:09.899 --> 52:12.834
They told me
I was one of them, and I...

52:15.604 --> 52:20.098
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style--
I swallowed it.

52:20.176 --> 52:22.440
I swallowed it.
I swallowed all of it.

52:23.846 --> 52:25.814
And they handed me their shit.

52:30.786 --> 52:34.278
I have no history.
I have no memory.

52:35.925 --> 52:37.859
I'm a fool, Tatsi.

52:39.528 --> 52:41.587
You are no fool.

52:45.101 --> 52:47.228
I know who you are.

52:51.073 --> 52:52.665
<i>News Service Africa.</i>

52:52.742 --> 52:56.473
<i>A United Nations source reports
that the U.S. and British representatives</i>

52:56.545 --> 52:59.173
<i>on the Security Council
will lobby for the removal</i>

52:59.248 --> 53:01.842
<i>of all U.N. peacekeepers
from Rwanda.</i>

53:22.872 --> 53:24.339
Please, Jack.
Please don't go.

53:24.406 --> 53:26.340
Wait, he's British.
Take out your passport.

53:27.243 --> 53:29.074
Jack, please don't leave me.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.209
Can we talk?
Just one second.

53:34.617 --> 53:36.107
Please, Jack. Please.

53:36.185 --> 53:38.779
They'll put me on the street.
They'll chop me.

53:40.990 --> 53:43.390
Here. Now just take...

53:44.160 --> 53:45.627
- Take this.
- No, no...

53:45.694 --> 53:47.924
Just take the money.
Please, just take the money.

53:47.997 --> 53:50.591
You must go. You must.
Please, they are waiting.

53:50.666 --> 53:52.361
- Paul!
- They are waiting.

53:52.434 --> 53:53.423
Paul.

53:54.770 --> 53:57.933
He won't put you out.
Here, give her anything she wants.

53:58.007 --> 53:59.998
- Anything. Just charge it.
- This is not necessary.

54:00.075 --> 54:02.407
- They're gonna kill us here.
- Let him go.

54:02.478 --> 54:04.412
We have to let him go.

54:12.188 --> 54:14.588
Don't do that, please.

54:14.657 --> 54:16.648
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed.

54:28.838 --> 54:30.829
Wait! Wait!

54:35.544 --> 54:37.375
Hold the buses!

54:37.446 --> 54:38.640
Peter!

54:51.694 --> 54:55.027
Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

54:55.097 --> 54:57.156
- No Rwandans.
- What?

54:57.233 --> 55:00.066
Foreign nationals only.
Sorry, Father, those were the orders.

55:00.135 --> 55:03.730
- But you can't leave the children behind.
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders.

55:03.806 --> 55:05.296
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more.

55:05.374 --> 55:07.205
Father, it is of no use.

55:07.276 --> 55:10.609
These men are not here--
They are not here to help us.

55:10.679 --> 55:12.340
Please, there is nothing we can do.

55:12.414 --> 55:14.575
Get your people on the bus.
I will take care of the others.

55:14.650 --> 55:16.641
It is of no use, Father.
Please, hurry.

55:20.589 --> 55:23.114
No, no, no.
No, no, no. No.

55:23.192 --> 55:24.819
To the hotel.
To the hotel.

55:29.031 --> 55:32.023
Sir, please, don't touch the camera.
We have the right to film.

55:32.101 --> 55:34.729
- No filming.
- Go to the hotel.

55:34.803 --> 55:36.270
Go inside.

55:37.373 --> 55:40.365
Go inside the hotel,
all of you.

55:40.442 --> 55:42.774
Yes, you can stay, yes.
We will take care of you.

55:42.845 --> 55:44.676
Go into the hotel.

55:49.084 --> 55:50.142
No!

55:51.186 --> 55:55.020
Go to the hotel.
Go inside. Go inside the hotel.

56:44.006 --> 56:46.270
Excuse me. Excuse me.

56:50.546 --> 56:52.810
- Sir.
- Come, Dube.

56:53.882 --> 56:56.942
- Please, everyone inside.
- Please, people, let's go inside.

56:57.019 --> 56:59.988
Out of the rain, please.
Come, sister, come.

57:05.761 --> 57:06.750
Paul.

57:11.066 --> 57:12.499
I want you to go.

57:13.969 --> 57:15.300
Go where?

57:17.906 --> 57:22.104
You take the children.
You go get the girls.

57:22.177 --> 57:24.338
- Your card says Hutu--
- What are you saying?

57:24.413 --> 57:27.814
Please, please.
You pay money at the roadblocks.

57:27.883 --> 57:29.817
I want you to go.

57:29.885 --> 57:31.546
No, Tatiana, no.

57:32.855 --> 57:34.584
I will never leave you.

57:37.593 --> 57:39.254
I will never leave you.

57:45.067 --> 57:46.227
Oh, Tatsi.

57:50.572 --> 57:53.405
Let us sleep, my wife.
Let us sleep.

58:06.688 --> 58:08.519
Get up. Get up.

58:08.590 --> 58:10.353
Get up, get up, get up.

58:12.327 --> 58:15.990
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir. What's the matter?

58:17.900 --> 58:19.697
Everyone must leave the hotel now.

58:19.768 --> 58:21.963
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

58:22.037 --> 58:23.334
It's an order.

58:24.840 --> 58:28.833
I need some time--
20, 30 minutes--to take a shower.

58:30.245 --> 58:33.510
- Sir, people are still sleeping.
- I don't care.

58:35.451 --> 58:39.581
Please, let me get you some beers.
You and your boys.

58:39.655 --> 58:42.715
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can.

58:42.791 --> 58:45.783
- Ten minutes.
- Yes, sir, ten minutes.

58:47.930 --> 58:50.057
- Get out of the way.
- Quick, children, quickly.

58:50.132 --> 58:53.158
- Roger's not here.
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

58:53.235 --> 58:54.395
Under the bed.

58:55.904 --> 58:58.236
Roger. It's Papa.

58:58.307 --> 59:00.207
They've gone.
They've gone, they've gone.

59:00.275 --> 59:02.573
Come, come. Come on.

59:06.482 --> 59:09.144
Oh, my darling.
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

59:09.218 --> 59:11.482
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

59:11.553 --> 59:14.078
- Go to the roof, Tatiana.
- The roof?

59:14.156 --> 59:16.351
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now.

59:17.126 --> 59:19.720
Yes, good day.
General Bizimungu, please.

59:20.929 --> 59:22.692
He is where?

59:22.764 --> 59:24.823
No, that is unacceptable.

59:24.900 --> 59:26.561
Who would order such a thing?

59:28.637 --> 59:30.969
Yes, did you find the general?

59:34.543 --> 59:36.875
Gentlemen, please have some beer.

59:36.945 --> 59:38.537
Get me the guest list.

59:39.815 --> 59:40.975
Yes, sir.

59:43.752 --> 59:44.741
Yes?

59:44.820 --> 59:48.756
<i>Sorry, sir, but I have a call
from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.</i>

59:48.824 --> 59:50.758
Paul, are you all right?

59:50.826 --> 59:52.350
<i>We have a big problem, sir.</i>

59:52.427 --> 59:53.519
What?

59:53.595 --> 59:55.722
The Hutu army have come.

59:55.797 --> 59:58.357
They've ordered us--
all of us--out of the hotel.

59:58.433 --> 01:00:00.196
Why are they doing this?

01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:02.737
I think they will kill us all.

01:00:02.804 --> 01:00:03.793
Kill?

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:09.103
What do you mean...all?
How many?

01:00:09.178 --> 01:00:14.047
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests.

01:00:14.116 --> 01:00:16.107
<i>- 800?!
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:00:16.185 --> 01:00:19.382
<i>There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.</i>

01:00:19.454 --> 01:00:22.014
I do not have much time left, sir.

01:00:25.794 --> 01:00:27.659
I want to thank you

01:00:27.729 --> 01:00:30.027
<i>for everything that you
have done for me and my family,</i>

01:00:30.098 --> 01:00:33.226
<i>and please thank all
of my friends at Sabena.</i>

01:00:34.736 --> 01:00:36.294
Paul, wait.

01:00:36.872 --> 01:00:39.636
I'm gonna put you on hold.
Stay by the phone.

01:00:40.776 --> 01:00:43.574
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir.

01:00:43.645 --> 01:00:46.944
We don't have any papers.
They got burnt in the house.

01:00:47.849 --> 01:00:50.511
Louis, get on to the U.N.
Tell them what's happening.

01:00:50.586 --> 01:00:52.019
Did you need something, sir?

01:00:52.087 --> 01:00:56.490
Mary, call the prime minister's office.
Tell them I must speak with him now.

01:00:56.558 --> 01:00:57.684
Okay.

01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:02.788
Paul, are you there?

01:01:03.632 --> 01:01:04.621
Yes, sir.

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:06.429
Who can I call to stop this?

01:01:08.971 --> 01:01:12.031
The French.
They supply the Hutu army.

01:01:13.342 --> 01:01:17.176
Do everything you can to buy time.
I'll call you right back.

01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:23.674
What are you doing, Dube?

01:01:23.752 --> 01:01:26.687
The lieutenant, sir,
he wants to see the guest list.

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:32.954
- Go and get these boys some more beer.
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

01:01:33.028 --> 01:01:34.359
Thank you.

01:01:37.266 --> 01:01:38.597
Come with me, please.

01:01:43.238 --> 01:01:45.399
Sir, that was two weeks ago.

01:01:50.679 --> 01:01:52.169
Here you are, sir.

01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:57.449
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier...

01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.310
What is this?

01:02:03.258 --> 01:02:04.748
It is the guest list, sir.

01:02:05.761 --> 01:02:07.854
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

01:02:07.929 --> 01:02:13.026
No. We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered.

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:16.593
- This is the only guest list, sir.
- There are no Europeans left!

01:02:17.706 --> 01:02:22.040
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now.

01:02:22.944 --> 01:02:25.879
- That will take time.
- We don't have time.

01:02:25.947 --> 01:02:30.646
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:33.552
then I'll kill everyone in there.

01:02:35.057 --> 01:02:36.547
Starting with you.

01:02:37.326 --> 01:02:38.850
Leave.

01:02:41.263 --> 01:02:42.321
Yes, sir.

01:02:54.576 --> 01:02:55.975
Yes, sir.

01:02:56.645 --> 01:02:57.805
Who did you call?

01:02:58.980 --> 01:03:01.312
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

01:03:03.719 --> 01:03:05.710
What is your name?

01:03:05.787 --> 01:03:08.119
Rusesabagina.

01:03:09.224 --> 01:03:11.158
Paul Rusesabagina.

01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:13.525
I'll remember you.

01:03:14.796 --> 01:03:16.195
I'll remember you.

01:03:17.165 --> 01:03:20.896
- Let's go.
- Come on, we're leaving.

01:03:30.445 --> 01:03:31.434
They've gone.

01:03:34.783 --> 01:03:36.182
Paul. Paul.

01:03:38.854 --> 01:03:40.845
I was afraid for you.

01:03:42.190 --> 01:03:45.853
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you.

01:03:47.229 --> 01:03:49.163
I must talk with this man.

01:03:55.003 --> 01:03:57.733
<i>- Mr. Tillens.
- Paul, what's going on?</i>

01:03:57.806 --> 01:04:01.139
They left. Thank you, sir.
What did you do?

01:04:01.209 --> 01:04:04.303
I got through to the French
president's office.

01:04:06.548 --> 01:04:08.880
Well, thank you.
You have saved our lives.

01:04:09.718 --> 01:04:14.348
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all.

01:04:15.290 --> 01:04:17.918
<i>I am afraid this is not
going to happen.</i>

01:04:19.594 --> 01:04:22.085
They're cowards, Paul.

01:04:22.998 --> 01:04:26.729
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them.

01:04:28.136 --> 01:04:31.071
The French, the British,
the Americans.

01:04:32.174 --> 01:04:33.835
I am sorry, Paul.

01:04:36.111 --> 01:04:37.203
Thank you.

01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:42.476
There will be no rescue...

01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:45.910
...no intervention for us.

01:04:47.456 --> 01:04:49.788
We can only save ourselves.

01:04:50.992 --> 01:04:53.153
Many of you know
influential people abroad.

01:04:53.228 --> 01:04:54.718
You must call these people.

01:04:54.796 --> 01:04:57.822
Please, fax this
to this number. Thank you.

01:04:57.899 --> 01:05:00.629
You must tell them
what will happen to us.

01:05:02.304 --> 01:05:03.794
Say good-bye.

01:05:06.741 --> 01:05:08.504
But when you say good-bye,

01:05:08.577 --> 01:05:13.742
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand.

01:05:14.649 --> 01:05:17.345
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand...

01:05:19.454 --> 01:05:20.944
...you will die.

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:28.023
We must shame them
into sending help.

01:05:30.465 --> 01:05:35.425
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp.

01:05:35.504 --> 01:05:39.600
The hterhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel.

01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:43.371
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive.

01:05:43.445 --> 01:05:45.379
Have you printed the bills?

01:05:46.882 --> 01:05:49.373
Thank you.
Now please erase the register.

01:05:49.451 --> 01:05:52.477
- Erase it?
- Yes. I want no names to appear there.

01:05:53.188 --> 01:05:55.156
Boss, the carpenters are ready.

01:05:55.223 --> 01:05:57.953
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors.

01:05:58.026 --> 01:06:00.051
- And put what?
- And put nothing.

01:06:07.903 --> 01:06:10.565
Good day.
Here is your bill for the last week.

01:06:10.639 --> 01:06:13.301
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:16.776
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you. Thank you.

01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:23.384
<i>Does the State Department
have a view</i>

01:06:23.451 --> 01:06:27.649
<i>as to whether or not
what is happening could be genocide?</i>

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:31.123
<i>We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.</i>

01:06:31.192 --> 01:06:35.925
<i>How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?</i>

01:06:35.997 --> 01:06:39.023
<i>Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.</i>

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.661
<i>Is it true that you
have specific guidance</i>

01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:45.228
<i>not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation,</i>

01:06:45.307 --> 01:06:47.901
<i>but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?</i>

01:06:49.444 --> 01:06:54.507
<i>I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.</i>

01:06:54.583 --> 01:06:56.141
<i>I have--</i>

01:06:56.217 --> 01:06:58.651
<i>There are formulations
that we are using</i>

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.712
<i>that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of--</i>

01:07:04.326 --> 01:07:06.123
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.

01:07:07.228 --> 01:07:08.889
As long as it is scotch.

01:07:11.199 --> 01:07:14.930
Your white friends
have abandoned you.

01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:19.333
- So it would seem.
- Well, don't worry.

01:07:19.407 --> 01:07:22.706
- I will take care of you.
- I'm glad to hear that

01:07:22.777 --> 01:07:25.712
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:26.974
To protect us, sir.

01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:30.040
- The police are very busy, Paul.
- Yes, I'm aware of this.

01:07:30.118 --> 01:07:33.383
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

01:07:33.455 --> 01:07:36.856
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

01:07:36.925 --> 01:07:38.415
would be well rewarded.

01:07:39.427 --> 01:07:40.758
I will see what I can do.

01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:43.591
Excuse me momentarily, sir.

01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.096
Where has all our beer gone?

01:07:48.103 --> 01:07:50.833
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer.

01:07:51.539 --> 01:07:52.938
How much beer?

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:54.967
Many.

01:07:58.346 --> 01:08:01.281
...come down to the reception.
And then he says to me,

01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:02.976
"How do you want the girls?"

01:08:04.953 --> 01:08:07.888
There's our cockroach manager.
Always kissing ass.

01:08:13.595 --> 01:08:14.755
General...

01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:18.227
I'm glad you came by.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.468
I overheard something
that I think you should know about.

01:08:21.536 --> 01:08:22.764
What did you overhear?

01:08:22.837 --> 01:08:27.103
It was a discussion between a U.N. Colonel
and an American Embassy official.

01:08:27.175 --> 01:08:28.573
And what did they say?

01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:31.475
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything.

01:08:31.546 --> 01:08:33.104
How? They have gone, Paul.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.274
With their spies. Satellites.

01:08:38.787 --> 01:08:40.618
Americans.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:42.589
Oh, Gregoire!

01:08:46.394 --> 01:08:48.294
You know, I admire you, General.

01:08:48.997 --> 01:08:51.795
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:55.631
- I am a strong man, Paul.
- I wish I were more like you.

01:08:56.571 --> 01:08:58.937
- I mean, look at my staff.
- Cheers.

01:08:59.006 --> 01:09:01.669
He won't work,
listens to no one.

01:09:01.743 --> 01:09:04.337
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes.

01:09:04.412 --> 01:09:05.401
Yes.

01:09:16.157 --> 01:09:18.318
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

01:09:19.694 --> 01:09:21.127
Satellites?

01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:25.788
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:41.645
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food.

01:09:41.716 --> 01:09:45.652
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place.

01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:47.846
No. No, no.

01:09:47.921 --> 01:09:49.752
I have to, Tatiana.

01:09:49.823 --> 01:09:52.452
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him.

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:54.188
You cannot go alone.

01:09:55.063 --> 01:09:58.726
I'm not going alone.
I'll take Gregoire with me.

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.031
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.041
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire.

01:10:14.115 --> 01:10:17.175
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies.
- Please, please.

01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:19.883
We have a job this morning.

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:22.286
We are going
to see George Rutaganda.

01:10:23.358 --> 01:10:24.689
Please get the van.

01:10:44.445 --> 01:10:45.935
Show me your I.D.

01:10:46.014 --> 01:10:48.505
<i>Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down</i>

01:10:48.583 --> 01:10:51.609
<i>their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.</i>

01:10:51.686 --> 01:10:54.211
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda.

01:10:54.289 --> 01:10:58.658
<i>I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.</i>

01:10:58.726 --> 01:11:02.253
<i>Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.</i>

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:06.096
<i>Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.</i>

01:11:06.167 --> 01:11:08.635
<i>We need to exterminate these vermin.</i>

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:41.733
Hey, Paul, my old friend.

01:11:45.173 --> 01:11:49.132
Tutsi prostitutes and witches.
So, what can I do for you?

01:11:49.878 --> 01:11:52.472
- I need supplies, George.
- Anytime.

01:11:57.552 --> 01:12:01.147
Paul, everything is double the price now.
You understand that?

01:12:01.222 --> 01:12:04.385
Yes. I need rice, beans,

01:12:04.459 --> 01:12:07.860
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey.

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:12.522
Beer yes, but whiskey no.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.158
You have no whiskey?

01:12:14.235 --> 01:12:16.931
No whiskey, no spirits.

01:12:17.005 --> 01:12:21.738
Your...rich guests will have to do
without their scotch.

01:12:22.343 --> 01:12:25.835
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now.

01:12:26.948 --> 01:12:28.472
What are you saying, George?

01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:34.146
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,
their money is no good to them anymore.

01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:37.219
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead.

01:12:39.794 --> 01:12:43.059
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

01:12:44.432 --> 01:12:45.831
And why not?

01:12:47.468 --> 01:12:49.060
Why not?

01:12:49.137 --> 01:12:51.628
We are halfway there already.

01:12:54.442 --> 01:12:57.309
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

01:12:58.513 --> 01:13:01.107
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer.

01:13:01.182 --> 01:13:02.672
Yes, sir, right away.

01:13:04.218 --> 01:13:10.020
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge.

01:13:11.526 --> 01:13:12.618
Yes.

01:13:14.362 --> 01:13:17.092
Ten bags of beans.
Come, quick.

01:13:17.732 --> 01:13:20.257
And put those in the van. You.

01:13:21.869 --> 01:13:23.860
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend.

01:13:23.938 --> 01:13:26.668
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

01:13:26.741 --> 01:13:28.936
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here."

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:33.276
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge.

01:13:34.515 --> 01:13:38.747
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat.

01:13:49.664 --> 01:13:51.063
Let's go.

01:13:54.002 --> 01:13:55.993
Maybe you could help us, Paul.

01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:58.937
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel.

01:13:59.607 --> 01:14:01.438
Now, if we were to get them,

01:14:01.509 --> 01:14:05.309
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own.

01:14:07.248 --> 01:14:08.647
Do you understand?

01:14:10.685 --> 01:14:13.518
It is almost dawn, George.

01:14:13.588 --> 01:14:15.681
We really must be going.

01:14:17.458 --> 01:14:20.655
Take the river road back.
It's clear.

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:44.944
- Gregoire.
- What is going on now?

01:14:45.019 --> 01:14:47.249
- You've driven off the road.
- No, I'm on the road.

01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:50.154
You're going to put us in the river.
Stop the car, stop the car.

01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:16.404
Back up the car, Gregoire.

01:16:18.312 --> 01:16:19.472
Listen to me.

01:16:21.082 --> 01:16:24.245
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today.

01:16:24.318 --> 01:16:25.717
No one, Gregoire.

01:16:42.036 --> 01:16:46.029
Dube. Please help Gregoire
to unload the van. Thank you.

01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:21.773
Oh, dear.

01:17:53.908 --> 01:17:55.170
Oh, God!

01:17:58.379 --> 01:17:59.607
Oh, God!

01:18:00.815 --> 01:18:02.146
- Sir.
- Dube!

01:18:02.216 --> 01:18:06.084
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in. Don't come in.

01:18:06.153 --> 01:18:08.144
I'll be out in a minute.

01:18:09.423 --> 01:18:12.256
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.957
Don't come in. I'll be out.

01:18:49.263 --> 01:18:50.525
Hundreds.

01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:55.360
It was too many to count.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:01.374
Why are people so cruel?

01:19:05.346 --> 01:19:06.506
Hatred.

01:19:07.982 --> 01:19:09.813
Insanity. I don't know.

01:19:15.523 --> 01:19:16.547
There you go.

01:19:16.624 --> 01:19:18.922
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

01:19:18.993 --> 01:19:20.893
Oh, yes.

01:19:22.063 --> 01:19:24.554
...to do with you.
Nothing to do with me.

01:19:24.632 --> 01:19:26.031
I remember...

01:19:27.134 --> 01:19:28.863
No, no, no, you make a mistake.

01:19:28.936 --> 01:19:30.631
- Hello.
- Come with me.

01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:34.574
- Where are we going?
- Just come.

01:19:51.425 --> 01:19:52.756
It's beautiful.

01:19:54.762 --> 01:19:56.024
You like it?

01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:07.906
I hear we must pay for everything.

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.465
Yes, this is true.

01:20:10.778 --> 01:20:14.270
So...how much for this?

01:20:16.283 --> 01:20:17.773
A kiss.

01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:34.465
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina.

01:20:51.152 --> 01:20:52.744
I have a confession.

01:20:54.822 --> 01:20:56.813
When you worked as the nurse...

01:20:56.891 --> 01:20:59.052
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes.

01:20:59.126 --> 01:21:01.151
When we first met...

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:05.221
I had you transferred to Kigali.

01:21:07.568 --> 01:21:08.899
What?

01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:14.364
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali.

01:21:16.243 --> 01:21:18.837
- Why?
- To be closer.

01:21:20.314 --> 01:21:22.043
So that I could marry you.

01:21:28.722 --> 01:21:30.053
What was the bribe?

01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.023
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial.

01:21:36.096 --> 01:21:38.929
- Tell me what it was.
- A car.

01:21:41.035 --> 01:21:43.868
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

01:21:43.938 --> 01:21:45.803
I want to know.

01:21:47.374 --> 01:21:48.966
A Volkswagen.

01:21:53.981 --> 01:21:55.312
I hope it was a new one.

01:22:20.407 --> 01:22:23.570
We have had a good life,
you and I. Yes.

01:22:26.547 --> 01:22:31.143
I thank God every day
for the time we've had.

01:22:37.191 --> 01:22:41.093
- We have to have a plan.
- A plan?

01:22:42.963 --> 01:22:45.955
Our children cannot
see us die first.

01:22:46.033 --> 01:22:49.434
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can.

01:22:49.503 --> 01:22:52.165
- Please, I don't want to--
- You must come up here, Tatiana.

01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:55.174
- I don't want you to talk like this, please.
- We have to, Tatiana.

01:22:56.977 --> 01:22:59.377
If I do not make it,

01:22:59.446 --> 01:23:02.244
you must take all of our children
by the hand...

01:23:04.018 --> 01:23:05.349
...and you must jump.

01:23:07.421 --> 01:23:10.754
- What are you saying? I could never--
- You have to, Tatiana.

01:23:10.824 --> 01:23:13.588
- You have to promise me.
- What are you saying?

01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:16.960
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die.
You have to promise me you will do it.

01:23:17.031 --> 01:23:18.760
I cannot do--

01:23:18.832 --> 01:23:21.596
You have to
promise me, Tatiana. Please.

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:23.261
Promise me you will do it.

01:23:26.907 --> 01:23:28.738
Please, Tatiana.

01:23:31.879 --> 01:23:33.039
Yes.

01:23:35.883 --> 01:23:37.612
I'm sorry. I love you.

01:23:39.353 --> 01:23:40.684
I love you.

01:23:48.562 --> 01:23:50.052
I'm gonna get you!

01:23:51.498 --> 01:23:53.489
Diane, Elys, you know better.

01:23:53.567 --> 01:23:56.092
No one can be at the front
of the hotel. I have told you this.

01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:58.468
- Take these children in the back. Hurry.
- Sorry, Papa.

01:23:59.673 --> 01:24:01.504
- Come, children. Come.
- Thank you, Dube.

01:24:04.244 --> 01:24:07.475
Paul, I've got good news.

01:24:10.484 --> 01:24:14.215
Congratulations.
Your calls have worked.

01:24:14.288 --> 01:24:18.088
I have exit visas
for the following families.

01:24:18.158 --> 01:24:21.355
Abukesu, Tanzania.

01:24:21.428 --> 01:24:24.420
Bidori, Kenya.

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:28.426
Gituaranga, Zambia.

01:24:28.502 --> 01:24:30.265
Hallelujah!

01:24:30.337 --> 01:24:31.998
Khalesa, Belgium.

01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:33.232
Oh, thank you!

01:24:34.408 --> 01:24:35.807
Dakuzi...

01:24:37.378 --> 01:24:38.640
Kenya.

01:24:39.513 --> 01:24:42.277
Masambo, Zambia.

01:24:43.517 --> 01:24:45.849
Zinguru, Ghana.

01:24:45.919 --> 01:24:48.979
Rusesabagina, Belgium.

01:24:50.257 --> 01:24:51.724
All right, that's it.

01:24:53.193 --> 01:24:56.185
So remember,
families be ready at 7 a.m.

01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:57.525
Let's go.

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:58.656
- Colonel?
- Yeah.

01:24:59.733 --> 01:25:01.928
Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list.

01:25:02.002 --> 01:25:04.835
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette.

01:25:06.006 --> 01:25:09.567
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon.

01:25:09.643 --> 01:25:10.632
Excuse me.

01:25:13.147 --> 01:25:16.207
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list.

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:17.272
Yeah.

01:25:18.886 --> 01:25:21.821
The girls--
Paul, I will not leave without them.

01:25:31.832 --> 01:25:33.163
What have you brought us?

01:25:33.233 --> 01:25:36.566
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid.

01:25:36.637 --> 01:25:38.127
Thank you.

01:25:38.205 --> 01:25:40.696
- I hear there's to be a convoy.
- Yes.

01:25:40.774 --> 01:25:42.503
Are you on the list?

01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:50.712
Madame Archer, I have
an impossible request of you.

01:25:51.685 --> 01:25:54.950
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

01:25:55.022 --> 01:25:57.013
and bring the girls
back here to us?

01:25:57.091 --> 01:26:01.050
Paul, that side of town has been
destroyed in the fighting.

01:26:01.995 --> 01:26:03.326
They're probably dead.

01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:09.733
Madame Archer, I'm begging you.
Those girls have no one now.

01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:14.997
I'll try.

01:26:16.143 --> 01:26:18.236
We have to leave by 7 a.m.

01:26:18.746 --> 01:26:20.839
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

01:26:20.914 --> 01:26:24.577
Odette. Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here.

01:26:28.789 --> 01:26:32.782
Tell me, Paul, what country's
gonna take 20 Rwandan orphans?

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:36.591
I will find someone.
I promise you.

01:26:38.832 --> 01:26:40.959
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:26:48.475 --> 01:26:49.874
Come on, take my hand.

01:26:50.477 --> 01:26:53.810
<i>News Service Africa.
Today a Red Cross representative</i>

01:26:53.881 --> 01:26:56.441
<i>claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict</i>

01:26:56.517 --> 01:27:00.078
<i>may have climbed to as many
as 500.000 victims.</i>

01:27:00.154 --> 01:27:02.554
<i>One report stated
that 40.000 bodies</i>

01:27:02.623 --> 01:27:04.853
<i>had been removed
from Lake Victoria.</i>

01:27:06.727 --> 01:27:07.751
Where is she?

01:27:07.828 --> 01:27:11.594
I don't know.
We wait until seven.

01:27:11.665 --> 01:27:14.065
If she is not back
with the girls by then...

01:27:15.435 --> 01:27:16.925
...she may not be coming.

01:27:19.740 --> 01:27:20.729
Thank you.

01:27:20.808 --> 01:27:23.038
Please, take these letters.

01:27:23.110 --> 01:27:25.374
Yes, I will take your letters.

01:27:25.445 --> 01:27:27.913
Thank you so much, Paul,
taking the letter.

01:27:29.449 --> 01:27:32.282
- Thank you so much.
- Yes, I am sorry.

01:27:32.352 --> 01:27:33.512
Thank you very much.

01:27:33.587 --> 01:27:36.351
I am sorry. I wish I could
have done more. I am sorry.

01:27:38.659 --> 01:27:40.490
God be with you.

01:27:41.895 --> 01:27:45.058
- Yes, do you have any children?
- Yes, you're clear to go.

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.231
No, sorry, no good.

01:27:48.735 --> 01:27:51.101
Come. Come, children.

01:27:51.171 --> 01:27:52.900
Tatsi, come.

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.107
Please, Paul, the girls.
We wait a little longer.

01:27:57.177 --> 01:27:59.168
We cannot wait.
We cannot wait, Tatsi.

01:27:59.246 --> 01:28:00.235
There you go.

01:28:00.881 --> 01:28:02.212
Let's move out!

01:28:05.919 --> 01:28:07.250
Good luck, sir.

01:28:18.665 --> 01:28:23.261
I am not leaving. You hold Tatiana.
Take care of my family.

01:28:29.443 --> 01:28:30.933
Paul. Paul!

01:28:32.112 --> 01:28:35.604
I cannot leave these people to die.
I cannot leave these people.

01:28:35.682 --> 01:28:36.944
Papa!

01:28:37.017 --> 01:28:39.986
Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight.

01:28:40.053 --> 01:28:42.817
No, don't leave me! Paul!

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:46.348
Don't worry. Don't worry, children.
Your father's going to be okay.

01:28:46.426 --> 01:28:47.450
Papa!

01:28:47.527 --> 01:28:51.293
- Don't worry. He's okay.
- I want Papa!

01:28:51.365 --> 01:28:52.832
It's okay.

01:29:18.358 --> 01:29:21.691
<i>I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches</i>

01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:24.094
<i>are the same as cockroaches.</i>

01:29:26.233 --> 01:29:28.098
<i>- They are all the same.
- This is crazy.</i>

01:29:28.168 --> 01:29:32.229
<i>Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.</i>

01:29:43.283 --> 01:29:47.447
<i>The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.</i>

01:29:47.521 --> 01:29:51.116
<i>Come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.</i>

01:29:51.191 --> 01:29:54.058
<i>- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station.</i>

01:29:55.162 --> 01:29:58.427
Okay. Yeah, they are
going to the airport.

01:30:02.002 --> 01:30:06.029
<i>Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.</i>

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:10.334
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube.

01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:13.379
It is important! It is on the radio.
You have to hear it.

01:30:14.748 --> 01:30:18.013
<i>We have received reports
of very important cockroaches</i>

01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:21.919
<i>and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille Collines Hotel.</i>

01:30:21.989 --> 01:30:23.513
<i>Gather up your weapons.</i>

01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:26.753
<i>Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.</i>

01:30:26.827 --> 01:30:30.058
<i>- They are being smuggled away...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?</i>

01:30:30.130 --> 01:30:33.395
I saw Gregoire, sir. It is Gregoire.
I saw him leaving in our bus.

01:30:42.976 --> 01:30:45.467
Please, sir,
I will give you whatever I have.

01:30:45.545 --> 01:30:48.105
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else.

01:30:50.550 --> 01:30:53.451
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush.

01:31:13.874 --> 01:31:15.034
Slow down.

01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:18.502
Stay calm.

01:31:19.112 --> 01:31:21.012
- What is happening?
- We're stopping.

01:31:23.183 --> 01:31:25.413
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks.

01:31:25.485 --> 01:31:27.851
No, no. I've got
U.N. personnel in these trucks.

01:31:27.921 --> 01:31:30.151
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks.

01:31:30.223 --> 01:31:33.556
- I'm going to search these trucks.
- You are not going to search this convoy.

01:31:35.195 --> 01:31:37.322
- I am.
- Cover me.

01:31:44.371 --> 01:31:45.861
Go to the back.

01:31:51.878 --> 01:31:55.507
Get away from that truck.
Get away from that truck! Now!

01:32:05.092 --> 01:32:07.219
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people.

01:32:08.795 --> 01:32:10.285
Get back! Move back!

01:32:10.964 --> 01:32:13.364
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck.

01:32:13.433 --> 01:32:17.096
No, no, no. They're political refugees
under U.N. sanction.

01:32:20.707 --> 01:32:24.871
<i>News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army</i>

01:32:24.945 --> 01:32:27.106
<i>who will not let us punish them.</i>

01:32:30.283 --> 01:32:31.272
No!

01:32:33.386 --> 01:32:35.377
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

01:32:35.455 --> 01:32:37.923
No, sir. No, sir,
they're political refugees.

01:32:37.991 --> 01:32:41.051
- They cannot leave Mille Collines.
- They are not leaving.

01:32:41.928 --> 01:32:42.952
Stop him!

01:32:45.332 --> 01:32:46.697
You bastard!

01:32:52.472 --> 01:32:53.530
What's your name?

01:32:53.607 --> 01:32:55.973
- What's your name?
- I can't think...

01:32:56.776 --> 01:32:59.745
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

01:32:59.813 --> 01:33:02.646
What's your name?
What's your name?

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:04.581
Let's move! Drive!

01:33:04.651 --> 01:33:06.414
Move! Get out!

01:33:06.486 --> 01:33:07.976
Out, or I'll shoot!

01:33:11.224 --> 01:33:12.213
Get out!

01:33:15.996 --> 01:33:17.588
Drive, drive! Let's go!

01:33:18.532 --> 01:33:20.523
Help us get out of here.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.363
Clear the street!

01:33:32.012 --> 01:33:34.674
<i>I am receiving more news,
good Hutus.</i>

01:33:34.748 --> 01:33:38.582
<i>I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches</i>

01:33:38.652 --> 01:33:40.051
<i>are on a truck.</i>

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.350
<i>10.000 francs for their heads!</i>

01:33:44.624 --> 01:33:47.286
Stay still.
Give me your shirt, quickly.

01:33:56.870 --> 01:33:58.861
Come on, Paul.
Come on, come on!

01:33:58.939 --> 01:34:01.965
Come on, here, here.
Give me your hand. Come on.

01:34:04.511 --> 01:34:05.808
Please, please.

01:34:05.879 --> 01:34:08.712
- Hey, medic. Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please.

01:34:08.782 --> 01:34:10.511
Come, hurry, hurry.

01:34:13.386 --> 01:34:15.820
- Let me help you.
- Someone give this guard a hand, please.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:20.282
Oh, Tatiana, my darling.

01:34:23.363 --> 01:34:25.558
- I was so worried about you.
- Move that truck out of the way!

01:34:25.632 --> 01:34:26.621
Get him inside!

01:34:27.434 --> 01:34:29.595
Tatiana. Tatiana.

01:34:30.937 --> 01:34:33.428
You left me.
You left me.

01:34:33.506 --> 01:34:35.599
Take this. I don't want it.
I don't want it.

01:34:35.675 --> 01:34:38.473
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me. You are a liar!

01:34:40.714 --> 01:34:42.841
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:44.713
- I'm sorry.
- Papa, Papa.

01:34:44.784 --> 01:34:47.685
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you.

01:34:56.329 --> 01:34:59.093
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you.

01:34:59.966 --> 01:35:02.628
That was not
your decision to make.

01:35:02.702 --> 01:35:06.138
We make our decisions together.
That was our promise.

01:35:06.206 --> 01:35:07.901
You're right.

01:35:08.074 --> 01:35:10.008
You're right.

01:35:10.076 --> 01:35:12.977
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away.

01:35:13.046 --> 01:35:14.445
I'm sorry.

01:35:14.781 --> 01:35:15.975
Come on, put some more water.

01:35:16.049 --> 01:35:17.607
What are they doing?

01:35:18.718 --> 01:35:20.242
Dube.

01:35:21.021 --> 01:35:24.684
I'm sorry, sir. They shut down
the water. This is all we have.

01:35:31.231 --> 01:35:32.892
General.

01:35:32.966 --> 01:35:34.433
Where are my supplies?

01:35:35.268 --> 01:35:37.168
I'm sorry, sir.
The cellar is empty.

01:35:37.237 --> 01:35:42.300
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

01:35:42.375 --> 01:35:44.707
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

01:35:44.778 --> 01:35:47.076
Sir, I have money from the guests.

01:35:47.147 --> 01:35:49.081
Rwandan francs!

01:35:50.050 --> 01:35:52.211
Those are only good
for wiping your ass.

01:35:53.787 --> 01:35:55.914
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul.

01:35:55.989 --> 01:35:58.651
No more police,
no more protection.

01:36:00.026 --> 01:36:02.893
Let the U.N. take care of you.

01:36:05.832 --> 01:36:07.561
Drive. Go!

01:36:14.140 --> 01:36:16.267
What would Sabena make of this?

01:36:24.084 --> 01:36:25.176
Watch out!

01:36:31.157 --> 01:36:32.681
Get down, get down!

01:36:37.230 --> 01:36:39.494
Are you hurt?
Go outside.

01:36:39.566 --> 01:36:42.091
Please stay still.
There's glass here. I will get it out.

01:36:42.168 --> 01:36:43.897
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:46.097
Lots of cuts and bruises.

01:36:52.579 --> 01:36:54.444
Thank God it was a storeroom.

01:36:56.383 --> 01:36:59.318
<i>And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report</i>

01:36:59.386 --> 01:37:01.911
<i>that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army</i>

01:37:01.988 --> 01:37:05.856
<i>has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the Congo.</i>

01:37:05.925 --> 01:37:08.086
<i>One aid worker described it</i>

01:37:08.161 --> 01:37:11.187
<i>as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.</i>

01:37:11.264 --> 01:37:12.959
The rebels have taken half the city,

01:37:13.032 --> 01:37:17.230
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept.

01:37:18.138 --> 01:37:21.164
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

01:37:21.241 --> 01:37:23.072
and you people,
all of you,

01:37:23.143 --> 01:37:26.510
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe.

01:37:26.579 --> 01:37:28.638
The hterhamwe, what about them?

01:37:28.715 --> 01:37:32.048
- No one controls them.
- This time they will kill us all.

01:37:32.118 --> 01:37:34.518
They will kill us all if we stay here.

01:37:35.188 --> 01:37:36.917
We have to take the chance.

01:37:37.857 --> 01:37:39.848
What time should we
be ready to leave?

01:37:40.794 --> 01:37:42.887
I can put it together
in two days, Paul.

01:37:42.962 --> 01:37:44.224
Two days?

01:37:45.064 --> 01:37:47.794
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days.

01:37:47.867 --> 01:37:49.664
I have nothing left
to bribe them with.

01:37:51.204 --> 01:37:55.265
Colonel, we will
all be dead in two days.

01:38:18.898 --> 01:38:22.061
Diane...let your mother rest.

01:38:22.135 --> 01:38:24.467
You rest too, sweetheart.
Go to sleep.

01:38:33.313 --> 01:38:34.541
Diplomat.

01:38:36.549 --> 01:38:37.607
What?

01:38:38.518 --> 01:38:40.452
I have to go to the Diplomat.

01:38:50.763 --> 01:38:53.630
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat.

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.225
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there.

01:38:57.670 --> 01:39:00.161
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:03.141
No. Let us see
what you have to offer first.

01:39:14.587 --> 01:39:16.748
Oh, no. Madame Archer.

01:39:34.607 --> 01:39:35.596
Move, move!

01:39:41.047 --> 01:39:42.378
- Cover us.
- Yes, sir.

01:39:42.448 --> 01:39:43.437
Hurry!

01:39:47.787 --> 01:39:49.084
Come on, show me.

01:39:58.298 --> 01:40:01.131
Look at this.
Nice, yes?

01:40:01.901 --> 01:40:03.232
And here you are.

01:40:10.043 --> 01:40:12.603
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

01:40:13.479 --> 01:40:16.004
The rebels can have this graveyard.

01:40:16.082 --> 01:40:18.414
We have ordered everyone
out of the city.

01:40:21.154 --> 01:40:22.314
Here.

01:40:23.423 --> 01:40:24.651
Have a drink.

01:40:31.431 --> 01:40:33.422
You know what
the Scottish call it?

01:40:33.499 --> 01:40:34.989
No.

01:40:36.836 --> 01:40:40.237
<i>Uisge beatha--water of life.</i>

01:40:46.446 --> 01:40:52.385
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world.

01:40:53.252 --> 01:40:56.187
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir.

01:40:57.323 --> 01:40:58.813
Wonderful country.

01:40:59.559 --> 01:41:01.151
Wonderful golf.

01:41:02.395 --> 01:41:05.489
I wonder, will I ever go back?

01:41:07.133 --> 01:41:08.395
What do you think?

01:41:09.769 --> 01:41:10.929
No.

01:41:12.538 --> 01:41:15.530
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General.

01:41:17.043 --> 01:41:18.601
Can we go now,
please, sir?

01:41:20.346 --> 01:41:23.008
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul.

01:41:23.116 --> 01:41:25.050
- Private.
- Yes, sir!

01:41:25.118 --> 01:41:28.315
Pack those carefully,
put them in my jeep, and guard them.

01:41:29.088 --> 01:41:33.616
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama.

01:41:34.394 --> 01:41:36.487
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir.

01:41:36.562 --> 01:41:39.224
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel.

01:41:39.298 --> 01:41:41.129
The crazy men are
on their way there now.

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:46.604
Sir...General, we must go back
so that I can get my family.

01:41:46.673 --> 01:41:49.801
Trust me,
we are better off here.

01:41:49.876 --> 01:41:54.745
General, these are difficult times.

01:41:54.814 --> 01:41:56.611
We need to help one another.

01:41:56.683 --> 01:42:00.016
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

01:42:00.086 --> 01:42:03.522
- You are a marked man, sir.
- How so?

01:42:03.589 --> 01:42:07.389
You are on a list. The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal.

01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.452
Paul, I am sick and tired
of your lies.

01:42:10.530 --> 01:42:13.294
Are you stupid, General?

01:42:13.366 --> 01:42:15.561
How do you think
these people operate?

01:42:15.635 --> 01:42:20.095
You sit here with five stars on your chest.
Who do you think they are coming after?

01:42:24.711 --> 01:42:25.871
Fine.

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:31.216
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list.

01:42:31.284 --> 01:42:35.186
- I committed no war crimes.
- Who will tell them?

01:42:35.254 --> 01:42:38.189
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel.

01:42:38.257 --> 01:42:41.488
They blame you for all their misfortunes.
They say you led the massacres.

01:42:41.561 --> 01:42:43.051
I led no massacres!

01:42:43.129 --> 01:42:45.063
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:46.655
You will tell them the truth!

01:42:46.733 --> 01:42:48.928
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me.

01:42:50.770 --> 01:42:53.204
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

01:42:55.241 --> 01:42:56.572
Shoot me.

01:42:57.210 --> 01:42:59.337
Please shoot me.
It would be a blessing.

01:42:59.412 --> 01:43:02.745
I will pay you to shoot my family.

01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:05.081
You cannot hurt me.

01:43:05.151 --> 01:43:08.712
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

01:43:11.457 --> 01:43:14.324
We are leaving.
Right now.

01:43:23.169 --> 01:43:25.137
Get out!

01:43:27.440 --> 01:43:29.499
Get these people
away from the gate!

01:43:35.348 --> 01:43:37.407
Stop it! Stop it!

01:43:38.084 --> 01:43:39.415
Clear the hotel.

01:43:40.186 --> 01:43:42.347
- Tatiana!
- Get out of here!

01:43:42.421 --> 01:43:43.820
- Get out!
- Tatiana!

01:43:44.624 --> 01:43:45.886
Get out!

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:50.889
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

01:44:12.485 --> 01:44:13.645
Oh, no, no!

01:44:13.719 --> 01:44:15.209
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

01:44:17.723 --> 01:44:19.588
That's him. That's him!

01:44:20.726 --> 01:44:22.853
- Shit.
- That's the manager!

01:44:22.929 --> 01:44:26.194
- Stop him. Stop him!
- I got him! I got him!

01:44:37.476 --> 01:44:39.501
Stay where you are!

01:44:56.495 --> 01:44:58.122
Tatiana!

01:44:59.432 --> 01:45:01.161
Tatiana!

01:45:07.139 --> 01:45:09.403
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana.

01:45:09.475 --> 01:45:11.966
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:15.406
Tatiana!

01:45:19.418 --> 01:45:20.578
Tatiana!

01:45:47.346 --> 01:45:49.109
They've gone. They've gone.

01:45:51.450 --> 01:45:52.439
They've gone.

01:45:57.356 --> 01:45:59.347
What were you
going to do with this?

01:46:09.068 --> 01:46:11.002
I thought you had...

01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:12.867
I thought you had jumped.

01:46:25.051 --> 01:46:27.212
Everyone on the trucks, please.

01:46:27.286 --> 01:46:30.050
Take your luggage.
Families please stay together.

01:46:30.122 --> 01:46:32.989
- Oh, please.
- As fast as you can, everyone. Please.

01:46:33.059 --> 01:46:35.493
There's enough room for everyone.

01:46:38.798 --> 01:46:40.663
I hope someday we will come back.

01:46:41.901 --> 01:46:43.095
Let's move out.

01:46:53.145 --> 01:46:55.238
What is wrong with her?

01:46:55.915 --> 01:46:58.008
She has a very high fever.

01:47:05.825 --> 01:47:08.293
Where are we going, Daddy?

01:47:08.361 --> 01:47:09.988
Someplace safe.

01:48:07.787 --> 01:48:09.015
My God.

01:48:31.410 --> 01:48:33.002
What's happening?

01:48:57.803 --> 01:49:01.000
Come on, let's go. Children on the ground.
Bring the children this way.

01:49:01.073 --> 01:49:03.337
Pass them back, pass them back.

01:49:09.415 --> 01:49:12.578
Do not stop. Do not stop!
Go right on through.

01:49:24.964 --> 01:49:26.397
Get down!

01:49:29.101 --> 01:49:30.227
Stay down!

01:49:53.759 --> 01:49:55.249
What's happening there?

01:49:58.764 --> 01:50:02.256
It's the rebels.
We're crossing the front line.

01:50:03.235 --> 01:50:05.999
It's okay. We're safe.

01:50:06.071 --> 01:50:07.197
It's okay.

01:50:07.273 --> 01:50:09.264
It's okay, you are safe here.
You are safe.

01:50:09.341 --> 01:50:12.970
It's okay now.
Sit back down.

01:50:14.747 --> 01:50:15.907
Hello.

01:50:46.612 --> 01:50:48.443
Get some more water.

01:50:49.715 --> 01:50:52.707
The doctor says he is
very dehydrated.

01:50:52.785 --> 01:50:55.310
We made it.
Come on, let's get down.

01:50:56.655 --> 01:50:58.486
- Come on.
- It is okay.

01:50:58.557 --> 01:51:00.286
- She is sick.
- Okay.

01:51:01.260 --> 01:51:02.727
Yeah, she's very sick.
Take her.

01:51:05.164 --> 01:51:09.498
Paul, the buses are
on the other side of camp.

01:51:09.568 --> 01:51:11.934
They'll take you to Tanzania.

01:51:12.004 --> 01:51:15.804
Go now, Paul, 'cause I don't know
when there'd be another opportunity.

01:51:15.874 --> 01:51:17.205
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:51:17.276 --> 01:51:19.506
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:51:22.481 --> 01:51:24.472
- Thank God.
- We made it.

01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:27.110
Please, please.
We are here, yeah?

01:51:27.186 --> 01:51:28.813
- Thank you, Paul.
- We have made it.

01:51:28.887 --> 01:51:30.878
- Thank you.
- Yes, yes. Come.

01:51:31.357 --> 01:51:32.346
Mr. Manager.

01:51:32.424 --> 01:51:34.824
- I just want to thank you.
- Of course, Steven.

01:51:34.893 --> 01:51:35.985
Constance!

01:51:36.929 --> 01:51:39.693
Thank God you are alive!
It's so good to see you.

01:51:39.765 --> 01:51:42.256
Have you seen my brother
and his wife?

01:51:42.334 --> 01:51:43.494
None of them.

01:51:44.270 --> 01:51:46.761
Has anyone seen these people?
You don't recog--

01:51:46.839 --> 01:51:49.171
Mama, come see quick.

01:51:49.241 --> 01:51:51.709
- Excuse me, excuse me.
- Can you see them anywhere?

01:51:53.712 --> 01:51:55.304
Here, Mama, look.

01:51:55.381 --> 01:51:56.643
Please.

01:51:58.284 --> 01:52:01.549
Do you see them, Mama?
Is that them?

01:52:02.254 --> 01:52:04.051
Is that them, Mama?

01:52:05.391 --> 01:52:07.484
Do you recognize these people?

01:52:07.559 --> 01:52:10.687
This little girl, she's Anais,
and this is Carine.

01:52:10.763 --> 01:52:12.253
Do you recognize them?

01:52:13.999 --> 01:52:17.696
- Ma'am, have you seen these girls?
- No, no, I haven't.

01:52:17.770 --> 01:52:19.931
Have any of you seen these girls?

01:52:22.374 --> 01:52:25.070
Anais. And that's my brother.

01:52:25.144 --> 01:52:27.135
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

01:52:35.888 --> 01:52:37.913
Can you feel anything
when I touch here?

01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:40.015
<i>Everybody on the buses!</i>

01:52:40.092 --> 01:52:42.686
Can you move out of the way?
We need some room here!

01:52:42.761 --> 01:52:46.094
- We'll find the girls, Tatsi. We will.
- Okay.

01:52:50.035 --> 01:52:51.662
Boussey?

01:52:51.737 --> 01:52:53.068
It's you.

01:52:56.141 --> 01:52:57.631
Where'd you find this child?

01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:00.042
They just arrived
on trucks from the Mille Collines.

01:53:02.247 --> 01:53:06.183
<i>All Mille Collines evacuees
to the buses now, please.</i>

01:53:06.251 --> 01:53:08.242
- Oh, no.
- We need to hurry up, please.

01:53:14.626 --> 01:53:16.958
Come on, get some sleep.

01:53:18.163 --> 01:53:19.289
Wait!

01:53:28.941 --> 01:53:30.772
Hold it, please!

01:53:33.545 --> 01:53:35.240
- Tatiana!
- It's Pat!

01:53:35.314 --> 01:53:37.782
- Tatiana!
- Madame Archer!

01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:40.580
Stop the bus!
Stop the bus, stop the bus!

01:53:40.652 --> 01:53:41.812
Come. Come, come.

01:53:42.688 --> 01:53:44.383
Please, wait for us.

01:53:44.456 --> 01:53:47.289
Madame Archer.
I was so worried. I thought...

01:53:48.527 --> 01:53:50.461
It's wonderful to see you.

01:53:50.529 --> 01:53:51.962
Come quickly.

01:53:59.405 --> 01:54:01.771
- Carine?
- Anais?

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.068
Anais?

01:54:03.142 --> 01:54:05.838
Just wait. It's gonna be
just a minute now.

01:54:07.746 --> 01:54:10.180
Anais? Carine?

01:54:24.863 --> 01:54:26.854
Oh, my God!

01:54:28.167 --> 01:54:30.192
Oh, my God!

01:54:30.269 --> 01:54:32.203
Come, come, come!

01:54:35.741 --> 01:54:39.677
Hello, Carine. Anais, hello.
How are you, sweetheart?

01:54:42.014 --> 01:54:43.675
Do you see your cousins?

01:54:51.523 --> 01:54:53.889
They said there wasn't any room.

01:54:53.959 --> 01:54:55.620
There's always room.
