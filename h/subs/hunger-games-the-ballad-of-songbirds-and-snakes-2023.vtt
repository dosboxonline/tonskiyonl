WEBVTT

01:00.582 --> 01:02.485
There's some food
over here! Quick!

01:14.467 --> 01:15.498
Come on!

01:34.216 --> 01:35.914
Why is he doing that?

01:36.690 --> 01:37.817
He's starving.

01:59.241 --> 02:02.407
Your father is dead, Coriolanus.

02:02.407 --> 02:05.047
It was a rebel, they say.

02:05.047 --> 02:07.145
A trap out in the forest

02:07.145 --> 02:09.222
in 12.

02:13.357 --> 02:16.691
It's up to us now
to make him proud.

03:07.779 --> 03:08.606
Tigris?

03:10.215 --> 03:12.311
<i>♪ Gem of Panem</i>

03:12.311 --> 03:14.215
<i>♪ Mighty city</i>

03:14.215 --> 03:15.583
Tigris, where's the shirt?

03:15.583 --> 03:19.421
<i>♪ Through the ages
You shine anew</i>

03:19.421 --> 03:24.130
<i>♪ We humbly kneel
To your ideal</i>

03:24.130 --> 03:26.694
<i>♪ And pledge
Our love to you ♪</i>

03:26.694 --> 03:29.299
- That's beautiful,
Grandma'am.

03:29.299 --> 03:31.029
- Perhaps a little sharp today.
- Oh.

03:31.029 --> 03:33.773
Have you seen Tigris
with my father's dress shirt?

03:33.773 --> 03:34.838
- No.

03:34.838 --> 03:35.900
Coryo?

03:35.900 --> 03:37.842
- Tigris?
I'm sorry.
I know I'm late.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.141
But look, I did it.

03:40.141 --> 03:42.541
Or, I did something.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.383
I think it's really gorgeous.

03:47.018 --> 03:48.387
It's beautiful.

03:50.184 --> 03:51.482
Best cousin ever.

03:51.482 --> 03:52.686
Tell me everything.

03:52.686 --> 03:55.557
Where do I start?
I told Fabricia at work

03:55.557 --> 03:57.691
that she needed
to bleach her white curtains

03:57.691 --> 04:00.165
and I slipped the shirt in
when I did it.

04:00.165 --> 04:01.760
The tesserae buttons
I made from...

04:01.760 --> 04:03.327
- From the bathroom tiles.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.833
Brilliant.

04:04.833 --> 04:07.305
Oh. Did you find the potatoes?
I boiled them for the starch

04:07.305 --> 04:09.369
and you should really
eat something today.

04:09.369 --> 04:10.607
Save them for Grandma'am.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.045
You look so handsome.

04:15.045 --> 04:17.782
Grandma'am! Come see!

04:17.782 --> 04:20.886
Coriolanus Snow.

04:20.886 --> 04:24.250
Future president of Panem.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.683
We salute you.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.426
- Just a moment.

04:28.862 --> 04:29.722
Wait, Grandma'am.

04:29.722 --> 04:33.597
I can grow plenty more.
After today.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.866
Got the grades,
never missed class.

04:39.971 --> 04:41.306
Ten years.

04:41.306 --> 04:43.436
Even Dean Highbottom
can't deny us this now.

04:43.436 --> 04:45.008
Dean doesn't hate you.

04:45.008 --> 04:46.844
He hates everyone.

04:46.844 --> 04:48.844
He despises me.

04:48.844 --> 04:51.450
What's the first thing you'll
spend the prize money on?

04:52.118 --> 04:53.815
- New dress?

04:55.657 --> 04:56.749
Chocolate?

04:56.749 --> 04:58.721
- Chocolate!

04:59.554 --> 05:01.620
It's the Plinth Prize, Tigris.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.027
We'll be able
to pay the rent.

05:04.027 --> 05:05.590
Snow lands on top.

05:34.356 --> 05:35.989
Why, Coriolanus Snow.

05:38.259 --> 05:39.465
Clemmie.

05:42.331 --> 05:44.100
Are you sweating?

05:44.100 --> 05:45.235
It's Reaping Day.

05:45.235 --> 05:46.700
We gave driver
the morning off.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.503
Ugh! That ingrate
should be begging

05:48.503 --> 05:49.704
to chauffeur
you around today.

05:49.704 --> 05:51.442
Just don't forget.
I was your class partner

05:51.442 --> 05:53.306
while you're gloating
over the Plinth Prize.

05:53.306 --> 05:54.675
Prize? Please.

05:54.675 --> 05:56.845
- I just want to serve Panem.
- Mmm.

05:58.048 --> 05:59.646
Hungry?

05:59.646 --> 06:01.580
Cook served steak
for breakfast.

06:01.580 --> 06:03.086
We had to throw half out.

06:03.086 --> 06:04.557
Shame on you, Coryo.

06:04.557 --> 06:06.722
Don't you know that
they're starving
in the districts?

06:10.259 --> 06:11.524
Good luck.

06:11.524 --> 06:12.927
Not that you'll need it.

06:14.031 --> 06:15.028
Hi.

06:16.971 --> 06:18.564
Finally, the star pupil.

06:18.564 --> 06:20.139
That's a snazzy shirt.

06:20.139 --> 06:21.937
What are those
buttons, tesserae?

06:21.937 --> 06:23.068
Huh.

06:23.068 --> 06:25.311
That's why they remind me
of the maid's bathroom.

06:25.311 --> 06:26.908
Have you tried this lamb?
It's scandalous.

06:26.908 --> 06:29.908
Ugh. Only the vulgar
eat with their fingers, Felix.

06:29.908 --> 06:32.445
What, Daddy not
teach you table manners?

06:32.445 --> 06:33.649
Maybe he would have

06:33.649 --> 06:35.114
if he wasn't so
busy running the country.

06:35.114 --> 06:37.785
Hey, they called us here
for the Plinth Prize, right?

06:37.785 --> 06:40.625
Because I heard
Dr. Gaul's in the building.

06:41.158 --> 06:42.225
"Plinth."

06:42.225 --> 06:44.296
I mean, look at his spawn.

06:44.296 --> 06:45.461
Who would have
thought that you could

06:45.461 --> 06:47.296
buy your way
into the Capitol?

06:47.296 --> 06:49.564
Well, you can't buy class.

06:49.564 --> 06:51.403
Did you see
his mother's outfit?

06:51.403 --> 06:53.497
- Sorry, his "Ma's."
Oh.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.038
Dress a turnip in
a ball gown, and it'll
still beg to be mashed.

06:57.101 --> 06:58.505
Don't do that. We all
know that you like him.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.043
I don't like him, Arachne.

07:00.043 --> 07:01.374
I tolerate him.

07:01.374 --> 07:02.443
He's district.

07:02.443 --> 07:03.612
Tolerate him.

07:03.612 --> 07:04.950
- Just don't encourage him.
- Okay. Sure.

07:04.950 --> 07:06.252
I hear one more time

07:06.252 --> 07:08.253
how immoral these
Hunger Games are,

07:08.253 --> 07:09.885
I'll put him
in the arena mys--

07:10.956 --> 07:12.423
Sejanus.

07:12.423 --> 07:14.293
You made it to
the Reaping for once.

07:14.293 --> 07:15.624
And you made it
to graduation, Festus.

07:15.624 --> 07:17.492
- We're both shocked.

07:17.492 --> 07:19.126
Spill it.
Who won the prize?

07:19.126 --> 07:21.261
Oh, no,
I'm not gonna ruin
my father's big day.

07:21.261 --> 07:25.538
No one here actually
likes him, but they
do love his money.

07:26.606 --> 07:28.937
You know what that's like,
don't you, Arachne?

07:30.008 --> 07:31.036
Funny.

07:40.448 --> 07:41.618
Hey, listen.

07:41.618 --> 07:44.821
Um, I know you have
high hopes for this.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.627
But there is no prize today.

07:50.062 --> 07:51.091
Not anymore.

07:53.694 --> 07:55.793
- I'm so sorry.
- What?

08:00.135 --> 08:05.341
How tantalizing to see
all your shining young faces

08:05.341 --> 08:08.009
on this auspicious day.

08:08.009 --> 08:12.350
I am Dr. Volumnia Gaul,
your humble Head Gamemaker,

08:12.350 --> 08:14.450
in charge of
the War Department

08:14.450 --> 08:18.786
and all
its affiliated concerns.

08:18.786 --> 08:22.257
I've broken free
of my laboratory today,

08:22.257 --> 08:23.857
to examine you.

08:23.857 --> 08:27.432
The leaders
of the next generation.

08:27.432 --> 08:30.796
I won't be around
forever, after all.

08:30.796 --> 08:33.899
And now to that end,

08:33.899 --> 08:36.475
I am honored
to introduce to you

08:36.475 --> 08:39.271
the creator of
the Hunger Games themselves.

08:40.576 --> 08:43.379
Dean Casca Highbottom.

08:43.379 --> 08:45.717
Uh...

08:47.318 --> 08:48.885
Select students,

08:50.385 --> 08:51.855
faculty,

08:53.326 --> 08:55.254
and, of course, Dr. Gaul,

08:56.859 --> 08:59.695
I have summoned
you all here today

08:59.695 --> 09:02.301
for the 10th annual
Reaping Ceremony

09:02.301 --> 09:04.366
in which we
choose two children

09:04.366 --> 09:06.467
from each district

09:06.467 --> 09:10.137
to throw into the Capitol Arena
to fight to the death
in the Hunger Games.

09:10.137 --> 09:12.077
I can't believe
they still allow him

09:12.077 --> 09:13.209
to speak in public.

09:13.209 --> 09:15.043
And here sit...

09:15.875 --> 09:19.684
our own 24 top prospects

09:19.684 --> 09:22.815
all waiting to hear
the results of hard study

09:22.815 --> 09:24.690
in this
prestigious institution.

09:24.690 --> 09:27.957
Eager to learn
who's won that
Plinth Prize, no doubt.

09:29.427 --> 09:30.993
And a golden future.

09:31.624 --> 09:32.758
However,

09:32.758 --> 09:34.093
I am here to tell you

09:34.093 --> 09:37.536
that there has been
a change this year.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.038
One final assignment
to prove your worth.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.100
Because...

09:42.100 --> 09:45.574
the esteemed citizens
of the Capitol

09:45.574 --> 09:47.105
have grown bored
of the Games

09:47.105 --> 09:49.114
and simply aren't
watching anymore.

09:49.114 --> 09:52.717
And if the Games are to
continue at all, there must
be an audience.

09:52.717 --> 09:56.722
So, Head Gamemaker Dr. Gaul
has stepped in to...

09:57.588 --> 09:59.151
incentivize patriotic values

09:59.151 --> 10:02.891
with her own unique flair,
starting with you.

10:02.891 --> 10:05.495
The Plinth Prize will
no longer be determined

10:05.495 --> 10:07.361
by who has the best grades.

10:07.361 --> 10:08.734
Excuse me?

10:08.734 --> 10:11.434
But by who is the best mentor
in the Hunger Games.

10:12.633 --> 10:15.373
This is a brand new role.

10:15.373 --> 10:16.838
As the Reaping
progresses live,

10:16.838 --> 10:18.938
I will allocate
each district tribute

10:18.938 --> 10:20.907
a Capitol mentor
behind the scenes,

10:20.907 --> 10:24.448
one who must
just persuade them

10:24.448 --> 10:26.585
to perform for the cameras.

10:26.585 --> 10:28.650
Obviously, the best
mentor will be the one

10:28.650 --> 10:30.116
whose tribute
wins the Games.

10:30.116 --> 10:31.788
What if I get
a pathetic runt girl

10:31.788 --> 10:34.086
from one of the poor
districts, like 8 or 12?

10:34.086 --> 10:35.990
They're just gonna die
in two minutes

10:35.990 --> 10:37.760
like they did last year
and the year before.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.991
Your role
is to turn these children

10:39.991 --> 10:42.562
into spectacles, Ms. Crane.

10:42.562 --> 10:44.231
Not survivors.

10:44.231 --> 10:47.904
Victory in the Games is only
one of our considerations.

10:47.904 --> 10:51.436
Your entire future
rests on this last project.

10:51.436 --> 10:55.614
Oh, and I must tell you
that anyone caught cheating

10:55.614 --> 10:58.311
to give their tributes
an unfair advantage...

10:59.312 --> 11:02.348
will just
have no future at all.

11:02.348 --> 11:05.725
- Oh! Here we go.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.961
Let the Reaping
ceremony begin.

11:11.593 --> 11:13.095
District 1.

11:14.401 --> 11:18.537
Boy goes to Livia Cardew.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.807
Girl goes to Palmyra Monty.

11:24.807 --> 11:27.340
- District 2 boy...

11:28.444 --> 11:29.975
How apt.

11:29.975 --> 11:32.281
Boy goes to Sejanus Plinth.

11:33.143 --> 11:35.554
You got the pick
of the litter.

11:35.554 --> 11:38.420
You forget.
I'm part of that litter.

11:38.420 --> 11:39.887
4, boy,

11:39.887 --> 11:41.688
- Persephone Price.

11:41.688 --> 11:44.095
Girl, Festus Creed.

11:45.660 --> 11:49.199
7, boy, Vipsania Sickle.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.433
Girl, Pup Harrington.

11:54.272 --> 11:58.343
8, boy, Juno Phipps.

11:58.343 --> 12:01.407
Girl, Hilarius Heavensbee.

12:02.511 --> 12:04.876
10, boy,

12:04.876 --> 12:06.511
Domitia Whimsiwick.

12:07.113 --> 12:11.657
Mmm. Girl, Arachne Crane.

12:11.657 --> 12:14.954
- 11, boy, Clemensia Dovecote.

12:14.954 --> 12:18.525
11, girl, Felix Ravinstill.

12:20.098 --> 12:21.834
12, boy,

12:22.636 --> 12:24.395
- Lysistrata Vickers.

12:24.395 --> 12:27.737
Oh. You'll be happy
about this, Ms. Crane.

12:27.737 --> 12:30.806
The "runt girl",
from District 12,

12:30.806 --> 12:33.373
she belongs
to Coriolanus Snow.

12:39.781 --> 12:43.321
Lucy Gray Baird.

12:57.001 --> 13:00.065
Sing your way
out of this one, Lucy Gray.

13:03.476 --> 13:05.608
What is that dress?

13:05.608 --> 13:07.572
Is she some sort of clown?

13:09.109 --> 13:10.911
Lucy Gray.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.945
I didn't know.

13:12.945 --> 13:15.283
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

13:32.965 --> 13:35.774
My daughter! Help her!

13:35.774 --> 13:38.375
- Help her! Help her!
- Get it off! Get it off!

13:46.884 --> 13:48.913
That's enough. Leave her be.

13:58.631 --> 14:00.328
Just give me a minute, boys.

<i>♪ You can't take my talkin'</i>

15:29.923 --> 15:32.721
<i>♪ You can kiss my ass! ♪</i>

15:50.411 --> 15:51.439
Come on, boys.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.675
Well, she's mentally ill.

16:10.597 --> 16:12.596
Proud, I see.

16:12.596 --> 16:13.758
Like your father.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.729
Yes. He and I
were best friends.

16:18.701 --> 16:19.731
Once.

16:20.607 --> 16:22.071
Enlighten me, Mr. Snow.

16:22.071 --> 16:24.436
What are your plans
after these Games?

16:24.436 --> 16:26.971
I hope to go on
to the University, sir.

16:26.971 --> 16:28.344
Naturally.

16:28.344 --> 16:31.079
And if you fail to win
the Plinth Prize, what then?

16:31.079 --> 16:32.777
We'd pay the tuition,
of course.

16:33.453 --> 16:34.449
Look at you.

16:35.919 --> 16:37.386
Your makeshift shirt

16:37.386 --> 16:41.324
and your too tight shoes.
Trying desperately to fit in

16:41.324 --> 16:46.195
when I know the Snows
don't have a pot to piss in.

16:46.195 --> 16:48.793
Good luck with
that poor little songbird.

16:51.265 --> 16:52.871
He's sabotaging us.

16:52.871 --> 16:54.598
That girl's not gonna
win these Games.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.635
You saw her.
She's underfed, unstable.

16:57.635 --> 16:59.909
The Dean said
it's not just about winning.

16:59.909 --> 17:02.309
Everything is about winning.

17:02.309 --> 17:04.809
If not the Games now,
then the crowd.

17:04.809 --> 17:08.012
Lucy Gray won't survive
a minute inside that arena.

17:08.012 --> 17:11.123
So that means
we have to make every
second before then count.

17:12.088 --> 17:13.718
I'll get her to sing again.

17:13.718 --> 17:16.926
I wouldn't sing
a note for you
if I was her.

17:16.926 --> 17:18.696
I wouldn't do
anything at all.

17:18.696 --> 17:20.632
Unless I could trust you.

17:20.632 --> 17:22.066
She's district, Tigris.

17:22.066 --> 17:24.398
She knows we hate her,
and she wants us dead.

17:24.398 --> 17:26.971
How am I supposed
to get her to trust me?

17:26.971 --> 17:29.204
Imagine it was your name
that they pulled

17:29.204 --> 17:31.409
and you had been
ripped from your home.

17:31.409 --> 17:34.641
I'd just wanna know
that somebody still
cared about me out here.

17:34.641 --> 17:38.315
Don't discount her just
because she's district, Coryo.

17:38.315 --> 17:40.680
You might have more in common
with her than you think.

18:01.535 --> 18:03.571
Transfer team, up front!

18:10.312 --> 18:12.415
Get off the train!

18:14.116 --> 18:15.618
Move.

18:15.618 --> 18:16.819
Let's go.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.557
Get out!

18:22.092 --> 18:23.525
Come on out!

18:24.763 --> 18:25.997
I said let's go!

18:25.997 --> 18:28.533
No! No!

18:28.533 --> 18:29.999
I will not...

18:29.999 --> 18:31.797
Go! Keep moving!

18:33.567 --> 18:35.573
No!
Come on.

18:35.573 --> 18:36.973
No!

18:36.973 --> 18:39.206
I said let's go!

18:39.206 --> 18:41.310
I won't go. I won't. No.

18:41.310 --> 18:43.649
Come on, get her outta there.

18:43.649 --> 18:44.810
Welcome to the Capitol.

18:49.716 --> 18:51.955
When I was little,
my mama used to bathe me

18:51.955 --> 18:53.687
in buttermilk and rose petals.

19:02.263 --> 19:03.499
Tastes like bedtime.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.298
You look like
you shouldn't be here.

19:07.298 --> 19:09.234
Well, I shouldn't.

19:09.234 --> 19:10.572
But I'm your mentor.

19:11.038 --> 19:12.343
A rebel.

19:13.510 --> 19:17.245
What does my mentor do
besides bring me roses?

19:17.245 --> 19:19.145
I do my best
to take care of you.

19:19.145 --> 19:20.851
No!

19:20.851 --> 19:22.118
On your feet.

19:22.118 --> 19:23.915
Good luck
with that, gorgeous.

19:26.220 --> 19:27.853
Come on, let's go.

19:28.528 --> 19:29.694
Move it.

19:29.694 --> 19:32.229
Excuse me, can I...

19:32.229 --> 19:34.700
Excuse me, I'd like
to escort my tribute...

19:34.700 --> 19:35.960
Fall in.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.370
In the truck. Hurry up.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.406
Hey!

19:42.940 --> 19:44.102
You, come on!

19:44.102 --> 19:45.304
Come on.

19:49.945 --> 19:50.942
Get in!

20:01.957 --> 20:02.994
Hi.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.423
What's the matter,
pretty boy?

20:04.423 --> 20:07.194
- You in the wrong cage?
- No.

20:07.194 --> 20:08.564
This cage is delightful.

20:09.065 --> 20:10.200
Get him, Reaper.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.966
- I will kill you right now.

20:11.966 --> 20:13.171
He'll do it too.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.135
Reaper killed
a Peacekeeper back in 11.

20:15.135 --> 20:16.237
Quiet, Dill.

20:16.237 --> 20:18.471
- I say we all kill him.
- I'm in.

20:18.471 --> 20:19.571
Nothing left to lose now.

20:19.571 --> 20:21.672
Y'all got
family back home?

20:21.672 --> 20:23.746
They'll kill them
if you hurt him.

20:23.746 --> 20:24.811
Then you.

20:25.511 --> 20:27.015
Besides, he's my mentor.

20:27.015 --> 20:28.380
I might need him.

20:28.380 --> 20:29.917
How come you get a mender?

20:29.917 --> 20:31.382
Mentor.

20:31.382 --> 20:33.554
You each get one.

20:33.554 --> 20:35.926
Oh, and we'll just
trust you on that? Right?

20:35.926 --> 20:37.923
I'm just here to help you.

20:37.923 --> 20:41.025
Why does rainbow girl here
get special treatment, hmm?

20:42.562 --> 20:44.028
Why aren't our menders here?

20:46.005 --> 20:47.537
Just not inspired, I guess.

20:54.608 --> 20:56.843
All right, hold on!
Get off me!

21:01.988 --> 21:03.722
- Oh! Ah!

21:03.722 --> 21:06.650
Ouch. Well, we'll give them
a chance to stand up
and catch their breath.

21:06.650 --> 21:08.225
I'm jealous of that entrance.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.719
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman,

21:09.719 --> 21:11.394
a man who needs
no introduction.

21:11.394 --> 21:12.592
You all know me
as your favorite weatherman

21:12.592 --> 21:14.859
- and amateur magician.

21:14.859 --> 21:17.364
But guess where I am today.
Here's a hint.

21:17.364 --> 21:18.898
That's right. The Capitol Zoo,

21:18.898 --> 21:21.635
where this year's tributes
will be held here on display

21:21.635 --> 21:23.975
behind these bars
for your viewing pleasure.

21:23.975 --> 21:25.173
- That's right.

21:25.173 --> 21:27.604
All 24 of them 'cause...

21:27.604 --> 21:29.774
What in the gem of Panem?

21:29.774 --> 21:32.477
You see, that's
the Academy rouge, no?

21:32.477 --> 21:34.215
Excuse me. Hello, sir.

21:34.215 --> 21:35.683
Yes, you. In the red.

21:35.683 --> 21:38.217
Who are you and why are you
in there with them?

21:38.217 --> 21:39.791
We're live.

21:41.092 --> 21:42.823
The Capitol is watching.

21:45.995 --> 21:47.058
Own it.

21:47.693 --> 21:49.097
Are you all right?

21:51.066 --> 21:53.397
Sir? Who are you?

21:53.397 --> 21:55.338
Lucy Gray Baird,

21:55.338 --> 21:57.001
may I introduce you
to my neighbors?

21:57.001 --> 21:59.945
A response would be
greatly appreciated,

21:59.945 --> 22:01.809
but anything would be nice.

22:04.112 --> 22:05.384
Hello?

22:07.582 --> 22:09.487
Can they not
hear me in there?

22:10.918 --> 22:13.188
Well, that's something
you don't see every day.

22:13.188 --> 22:14.990
They're holding hands.

22:14.990 --> 22:16.253
Yes, yes, yes.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.957
Who are you, sir?
What are you doing
in the cage here?

22:19.525 --> 22:21.494
Hi. How do you do?

22:21.494 --> 22:23.594
My name is Coriolanus Snow.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.202
And this is my tribute.

22:25.202 --> 22:26.935
Lucy Gray Baird
from District 12.

22:26.935 --> 22:27.964
Hi there.

22:27.964 --> 22:30.539
- What's your name?
- My name is Pontius.

22:30.539 --> 22:32.769
It's nice to meet you.
Is this your sister?

22:32.769 --> 22:34.774
That's Venus.
She's only four.

22:34.774 --> 22:37.246
Well, I think four
is a very smart age to be.

22:37.246 --> 22:38.977
Where'd you find that snake?

22:38.977 --> 22:41.483
Well, he found me.
Must have been a music lover.

22:41.483 --> 22:43.218
My singing calmed him
right down.

22:43.218 --> 22:44.855
Can I touch your dress?

22:44.855 --> 22:45.924
Of course.

22:45.924 --> 22:47.789
I like your dress too.

22:47.789 --> 22:50.426
- Oh. And who might you be?
- You don't know who I am?

22:50.426 --> 22:51.793
- Don't laugh.

22:51.793 --> 22:54.496
Not everyone has televisions
out in the districts.

22:54.496 --> 22:56.299
I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.

22:56.299 --> 22:58.134
But more enticingly,
who are you,

22:58.134 --> 22:59.904
Lucy From District 12?

22:59.904 --> 23:01.138
Oh. It's Lucy Gray.

23:01.138 --> 23:03.469
And I'm not actually from 12.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.936
No, my people are Covey.

23:04.936 --> 23:07.172
We're like a family.
We're musicians by trade

23:07.172 --> 23:09.372
and we travel
from place to place
as the fancy takes us.

23:09.372 --> 23:12.646
At least we used to.
Before the Peacekeepers
rounded us up.

23:12.646 --> 23:15.184
I see. But now
you're District 12.

23:15.184 --> 23:16.582
- If you say so.
- Yes.

23:16.582 --> 23:18.522
Your dress is far from gray

23:18.522 --> 23:20.989
and it seems to be a big hit
with the children.

23:20.989 --> 23:23.925
Oh, it is? Well,
the Covey love color,
me more so than most.

23:23.925 --> 23:26.395
But this dress was my mama's
so it's extra special to me.

23:26.395 --> 23:28.028
Mmm-hmm.
And she's in District 12?

23:28.028 --> 23:30.702
Well, only her bones, darling.
Only her pearly white bones.

23:32.600 --> 23:33.897
Do you know my mentor?

23:33.897 --> 23:35.604
Says his name
is Coriolanus Snow

23:35.604 --> 23:37.035
and clearly, I got
the cake with the cream

23:37.035 --> 23:39.071
'cause nobody else
has even bothered to show up.

23:40.845 --> 23:44.445
The Gamemakers did tell you
to jump in the cage with them?

23:44.445 --> 23:46.648
They didn't tell me not to.

23:46.648 --> 23:48.212
They just said
that it was a mentor's job

23:48.212 --> 23:51.450
to introduce our tributes
to the citizens of Panem.

23:51.450 --> 23:52.654
And I thought, well,

23:52.654 --> 23:53.886
if Lucy Gray
is brave enough to be here,

23:53.886 --> 23:55.524
- then why shouldn't I be, too?
Hmm.

23:55.524 --> 23:57.157
For the record,
I didn't have a choice.

23:57.157 --> 24:00.523
For the record, I think
you're about to be
whisked away, young man.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.931
Let's go.

24:01.931 --> 24:03.067
Oh. Hey...

24:03.067 --> 24:04.666
Get us some food, please.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.264
Jessup and I haven't eaten
since the Reaping.

24:06.264 --> 24:08.736
The 10th annual
Hunger Games
are soon approaching.

24:08.736 --> 24:11.772
So come down to the zoo,
and see these tributes

24:11.772 --> 24:15.411
before it's too late.
And I mean, too late.

24:15.411 --> 24:18.550
For Capitol News,
I'm Lucretius...

24:21.252 --> 24:22.554
"Lucky" Flickerman.

24:27.426 --> 24:29.625
Your little excursion
was in violation

24:29.625 --> 24:33.796
of about five different
Academy rules, Mr. Snow.

24:33.796 --> 24:37.032
Chief amongst them,
endangering a Capitol student.

24:37.032 --> 24:38.362
What? Who?

24:38.362 --> 24:39.665
You.

24:39.665 --> 24:41.406
I'm moving
for the Gamemakers

24:41.406 --> 24:43.672
to disqualify you
as mentor immediately.

24:43.672 --> 24:45.506
You said we had to get
our tributes to perform,

24:45.506 --> 24:46.639
not that we had to stay away.

24:46.639 --> 24:48.744
I'll add insubordination
as well.

24:48.744 --> 24:51.412
Holding her hand, Coryo,
introducing her to people,

24:51.412 --> 24:52.615
you make it look as if

24:52.615 --> 24:54.011
we're one and the same
as those animals.

24:54.011 --> 24:55.518
Coriolanus didn't
show those people

24:55.518 --> 24:56.815
anything they
didn't already know.

24:56.815 --> 24:58.015
I don't need
your help, Sejanus.

24:58.015 --> 25:00.452
That the tributes
are human beings.

25:00.452 --> 25:01.690
Just like us.

25:01.690 --> 25:03.427
That's why nobody wants
to watch the Games.

25:03.427 --> 25:05.626
It's because people
know deep down

25:05.626 --> 25:07.498
that winning a war
10 years ago

25:07.498 --> 25:09.566
doesn't justify starving
people's children,

25:09.566 --> 25:11.367
taking away their freedoms,
their rights.

25:11.367 --> 25:15.106
Snow fell down in the cage.

25:15.106 --> 25:17.601
It fell down in the cage

25:17.601 --> 25:20.139
but it landed...

25:21.475 --> 25:22.575
On stage.

25:22.575 --> 25:24.207
You're good at Games.

25:24.207 --> 25:27.416
Maybe one day, you'll be
a Gamemaker like me.

25:27.416 --> 25:29.650
If the Games continue at all.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.953
Oh, they'll continue.

25:31.953 --> 25:36.287
With performances like
young Mr. Snow's in that zoo.

25:36.287 --> 25:40.626
And I came here to ask
your star mentor a question.

25:43.369 --> 25:46.634
What are
the Hunger Games for?

25:46.634 --> 25:48.336
They're to punish
the districts

25:48.336 --> 25:49.869
for their uprising,

25:49.869 --> 25:52.002
to commemorate
the end of the war...

25:52.002 --> 25:53.374
"Commemorate the..."

25:53.374 --> 25:55.313
Dull, dull, dull.

25:55.313 --> 25:58.043
Punishment can
take myriad forms.

25:58.043 --> 26:01.151
Why not drop bombs,
cancel food shipments,

26:01.151 --> 26:02.953
stage executions?

26:02.953 --> 26:04.255
Why Games?

26:04.255 --> 26:05.656
Shouldn't we be
asking ourselves

26:05.656 --> 26:07.325
whether or not they're right
in the first place?

26:07.325 --> 26:08.892
You have a problem
with my Games?

26:08.892 --> 26:11.857
Some of those kids
were two years old
when the war ended.

26:11.857 --> 26:14.733
The oldest of them
were only eight.

26:14.733 --> 26:17.567
The Capitol is supposed to be
everyone's government now.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.733
It is supposed to
protect all of us.

26:19.733 --> 26:21.965
I don't see
how making children

26:21.965 --> 26:23.570
fight each other
to the death

26:23.570 --> 26:24.871
is protecting anyone.

26:24.871 --> 26:27.103
That sort of sympathy
might interfere

26:27.103 --> 26:29.247
with your
mentoring assignment.

26:29.247 --> 26:30.977
Perhaps the Capitol students

26:30.977 --> 26:33.580
are ill-suited to be
mentoring tributes.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.783
Perhaps the Game's time

26:35.783 --> 26:37.887
- has passed.
- Dean Highbottom is wrong.

26:39.126 --> 26:40.758
My classmates, too.

26:41.857 --> 26:43.920
Maybe Sejanus
is onto something here.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.527
Maybe we should be viewing

26:45.527 --> 26:48.391
those tributes as human beings.

26:48.391 --> 26:51.602
I mean, you saw those kids
in the zoo, they just...

26:51.602 --> 26:53.865
they just wanted
to get to know Lucy Gray.

26:53.865 --> 26:55.539
If we need people to watch,

26:55.539 --> 26:56.803
we should be
letting them get closer

26:56.803 --> 26:58.540
to the tributes
before the Games.

26:58.540 --> 27:00.511
To make the stakes personal.

27:00.511 --> 27:02.445
Who will watch the Games
if they care

27:02.445 --> 27:04.047
what happens to the tributes?

27:04.047 --> 27:05.946
Everyone.

27:05.946 --> 27:07.713
If they thought
the tribute they cared about

27:07.713 --> 27:09.618
had a chance of winning.

27:09.618 --> 27:11.421
People need someone
to root for

27:11.421 --> 27:12.751
and someone
to root against.

27:12.751 --> 27:14.657
We need them to invest.

27:14.657 --> 27:16.923
And if we bend
a few Capitol laws,

27:16.923 --> 27:18.994
we could even
have them place bets.

27:20.128 --> 27:23.499
Look, I know Lucy Gray
may not win in the arena

27:23.499 --> 27:25.902
but if you
give her a chance,

27:26.801 --> 27:28.099
I would bet the Plinth Prize

27:28.099 --> 27:30.134
that she can win
people's attention.

27:30.134 --> 27:32.169
I'd like you to
write up a proposal

27:32.169 --> 27:34.507
of these thoughts
tonight, Mr. Snow.

27:34.507 --> 27:35.943
Wait.

27:35.943 --> 27:38.746
You mean you might
actually use his ideas?

27:38.746 --> 27:40.850
If it'll help the ratings,
why not.

27:40.850 --> 27:45.182
Coriolanus and I are
class partners, Dr. Gaul.

27:45.182 --> 27:47.321
We do all of
our assignments together.

27:51.694 --> 27:54.425
It'll be
an interesting test.

28:03.304 --> 28:04.773
You trying
to fatten that poor girl up

28:04.773 --> 28:06.743
so you can finally
start taking bets?

28:06.743 --> 28:08.976
You think they'll give
those kids a scrap

28:08.976 --> 28:11.114
if we don't give them
a reason to do it?

28:11.114 --> 28:14.082
How do you think
your tribute will have
a chance if he can't eat?

28:22.229 --> 28:24.193
He was my classmate.

28:24.193 --> 28:26.026
Back in 2.

28:26.026 --> 28:28.159
- It's not your fault it's him.
- See, I know.

28:28.159 --> 28:30.296
I'm so blameless,
I'm choking on it.

28:31.971 --> 28:34.432
My father bought him for me,
you know, at the Reaping,

28:35.506 --> 28:36.804
Just so he could show me

28:36.804 --> 28:39.272
that I could never
go back to 2.

28:43.044 --> 28:44.810
But being Capitol
is gonna kill me.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.785
So do something about it.

28:53.193 --> 28:54.289
Quite the rebel.

28:54.289 --> 28:55.354
Oh, yeah.

28:56.922 --> 28:58.126
I'm bad news.

29:11.540 --> 29:13.944
Marcus. Hey.

29:14.806 --> 29:15.872
It's me.

29:15.872 --> 29:17.207
Marcus, look.

29:17.207 --> 29:19.048
Here, I got
some food for you.

29:20.284 --> 29:21.281
Here.

29:23.386 --> 29:24.383
Come on.

29:25.454 --> 29:26.484
Marcus.

29:36.236 --> 29:37.429
Is that for us?

29:43.703 --> 29:44.868
Jessup.

29:44.868 --> 29:46.440
I'm not hungry.

29:46.440 --> 29:49.047
You think I can't hear
your stomach growling,
Jessup Diggs?

29:49.047 --> 29:50.079
Come on.

29:55.752 --> 29:57.449
What happened to his neck?

29:57.916 --> 29:59.253
A bat bite.

30:00.493 --> 30:02.223
The first night on the train,

30:03.796 --> 30:05.058
he didn't sleep a wink
the whole journey

30:05.058 --> 30:06.628
'cause he was keeping
the bats off me,

30:06.628 --> 30:07.694
so I would get some rest.

30:10.028 --> 30:11.568
Can you take it?

30:11.568 --> 30:13.564
Come on,
try harder than that.

30:13.564 --> 30:16.399
One thing I learned in 12
is that hunger is a weapon.

30:16.399 --> 30:18.035
Your friend over there
sure knows it.

30:18.035 --> 30:19.138
She is not my friend.

30:19.138 --> 30:21.506
She is poison
with perfect teeth.

30:23.611 --> 30:27.116
Are you gonna share
everything that I give
you with Jessup?

30:27.517 --> 30:29.112
Wh... Why?

30:29.112 --> 30:32.390
You think I ought to build
up my strength so I can
strangle him in the arena?

30:32.390 --> 30:33.625
Not exactly my forte.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.156
I might have
a chance to help you.

30:36.156 --> 30:39.055
To make some suggestions
to the Gamemakers.

30:39.055 --> 30:43.832
I might even be able
to get the audience to
send you gifts in the arena.

30:43.832 --> 30:47.165
Food and water
to keep you going.

30:47.165 --> 30:49.538
You just have to
try singing again

30:49.538 --> 30:50.607
to win people over.

30:50.607 --> 30:51.742
I don't sing when I'm told.

30:51.742 --> 30:53.175
I sing when I have
something to say.

30:53.175 --> 30:55.907
Besides,
I've seen your arena.
There's nowhere to hide.

30:55.907 --> 30:57.212
What's the point?

30:59.013 --> 31:00.111
The guards say you get money

31:00.111 --> 31:01.379
if you get more
people to watch

31:01.379 --> 31:04.219
and you say you wanna
help me. Which is it?

31:06.192 --> 31:07.288
Both.

31:10.056 --> 31:11.189
One more time.

31:11.189 --> 31:12.590
I'm not playing this game.

31:14.367 --> 31:15.362
Come on.

31:17.635 --> 31:18.836
You shut up.

31:18.836 --> 31:20.831
- Uh... No, thank you.
- I saw you staring.

31:20.831 --> 31:22.072
Please.

31:24.005 --> 31:25.270
Give me something.

31:25.270 --> 31:27.308
I've been sitting here
for 15 minutes!

31:27.308 --> 31:29.543
Always thought there was
plenty of food in the Capitol.

31:30.946 --> 31:32.579
You know, one time,
during the war,

31:32.579 --> 31:35.679
I ate a whole jar of paste
just to stop the pain
in my stomach.

31:36.389 --> 31:37.516
And how was it?

31:40.787 --> 31:41.820
Pasty.

31:47.026 --> 31:48.230
That little one.

31:49.061 --> 31:50.960
She's so sweet.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.499
So young.

31:52.499 --> 31:55.402
Something about her
reminds me of
my cousin Maude Ivory.

31:57.670 --> 32:00.440
I can't stand to think
of them without me like this.

32:01.776 --> 32:03.047
I'm sorry.

32:08.954 --> 32:11.253
You seem like a good man,
Coriolanus Snow.

32:14.519 --> 32:15.956
Sure would've
been nice to meet you

32:15.956 --> 32:17.292
under different circumstances.

32:19.095 --> 32:21.065
- One of your shows, maybe.
- Yeah.

32:21.865 --> 32:23.730
We could have had a drink.

32:23.730 --> 32:25.135
A dance or two.

32:26.532 --> 32:28.067
Like we had
all the time in the world.

32:28.067 --> 32:29.168
Come on, just take it.

32:32.941 --> 32:34.774
Help!

32:34.774 --> 32:35.908
No, no, no!

32:38.245 --> 32:40.178
It's okay. It's okay.
Hold on. Hold on.

32:40.178 --> 32:41.479
- Hey, look at me.

32:41.479 --> 32:43.785
Hey, hold on.
It's okay. I'll get help.

32:43.785 --> 32:45.254
Somebody help us, please!

32:51.728 --> 32:53.290
Wha...

32:56.668 --> 32:57.830
- Let's go.
- Oh, no.

33:06.406 --> 33:08.376
<i>It's starting again.</i>

33:09.307 --> 33:12.145
This is how it begins.

33:12.145 --> 33:14.281
- The war.
It was my fault.

33:14.281 --> 33:17.151
I suggested we get
closer to the tributes.

33:17.151 --> 33:19.855
You're just lucky
that your songbird

33:19.855 --> 33:21.551
didn't peck out
your eyes too.

33:21.551 --> 33:23.659
She's not
a rebel, Grandma'am.

33:23.659 --> 33:24.760
She's just a girl.

33:26.196 --> 33:29.661
Trust me, that one hasn't
been a girl in a long time.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.536
Outside this Capitol,

33:33.536 --> 33:35.373
they're savages,

33:35.373 --> 33:36.805
one and all.

33:36.805 --> 33:39.906
However, they may smile,

33:39.906 --> 33:41.874
she will use you.

33:41.874 --> 33:44.181
You must use her

33:44.181 --> 33:48.515
or you'll end up dead
in the trees like your father.

34:07.202 --> 34:09.071
This is for Dr. Gaul, please.

34:09.071 --> 34:14.508
In spite of
yesterday's tragic events,

34:14.508 --> 34:18.848
our president has decided
that the Games must go on

34:18.848 --> 34:20.346
to show everyone the Capitol

34:20.346 --> 34:22.418
is unafraid
of such acts of terror.

34:22.418 --> 34:25.153
To which end,
Dr. Gaul wishes you
to preview the arena

34:25.153 --> 34:27.591
this afternoon
with your tributes.

34:27.591 --> 34:28.652
Later this evening,

34:28.652 --> 34:31.094
there will be a special
televised presentation

34:31.094 --> 34:33.630
of each tribute
to our audience to, you know,

34:33.630 --> 34:34.658
get to know them.

34:34.658 --> 34:36.893
You will have an hour
to discuss strategy.

34:46.546 --> 34:47.772
You may begin.

34:52.783 --> 34:54.214
Marcus, come on.

34:54.214 --> 34:57.049
You and I aren't
gonna be friends,

34:57.049 --> 34:59.019
but I'm gonna win,

34:59.019 --> 35:00.419
and for that to happen,

35:00.419 --> 35:03.461
- we need to make you more...

35:03.461 --> 35:04.453
marketable.

35:04.453 --> 35:06.923
I'm a really good climber.

35:06.923 --> 35:10.027
I used to climb in my mama's
factory all the time.

35:17.402 --> 35:19.210
It's getting infected.

35:19.875 --> 35:20.937
I'm fine.

35:21.813 --> 35:23.981
Look at me, Lamina.

35:23.981 --> 35:26.180
- I want you to win.

35:26.180 --> 35:27.779
It's Reaper, right?

35:30.086 --> 35:31.655
Um, let me
read you what...

35:35.226 --> 35:37.360
I'm so sorry
about your classmate.

35:38.762 --> 35:39.824
Thank you.

35:40.226 --> 35:41.562
Are you okay?

35:43.230 --> 35:44.464
Wearing my mama's dress

35:44.464 --> 35:45.828
is the only thing
keeping me together here.

35:45.828 --> 35:48.932
It's like she's wrapping
her arms around me.

35:50.241 --> 35:52.870
My mother,
she used to smell like roses.

35:55.176 --> 35:56.775
She died in childbirth.

35:57.643 --> 35:59.712
I was going to
have a little sister.

36:00.379 --> 36:01.945
Both your parents gone?

36:06.022 --> 36:08.085
So, you're an orphan.

36:08.085 --> 36:09.524
Like me.

36:11.827 --> 36:12.824
Look...

36:14.332 --> 36:17.829
I need you to sing
in these interviews later.

36:18.663 --> 36:20.632
It's the night
before the Games

36:20.632 --> 36:22.933
and your last chance
to win people over.

36:24.175 --> 36:25.302
I can't send you gifts
in the arena

36:25.302 --> 36:27.144
without their money.

36:27.144 --> 36:31.679
Maybe a guitar
could persuade me. Maybe.

36:31.679 --> 36:35.448
You really wanna
take care of me in
that arena, Coriolanus?

36:35.448 --> 36:37.948
Start by thinking
I can actually win.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.456
Snow. Dovecote.

36:41.623 --> 36:43.522
She can't
expect us to have written

36:43.522 --> 36:45.796
that proposal
last night, can she?

36:45.796 --> 36:47.896
I was crying for hours.

36:47.896 --> 36:50.901
We did... write it.

36:50.901 --> 36:52.234
I turned it in this morning.

36:52.234 --> 36:53.931
All right, give me
the bullet points.

37:10.251 --> 37:11.787
Mr. Snow.

37:11.787 --> 37:13.423
Ms. Dovecote.

37:14.058 --> 37:15.920
Come and see my new babies.

37:37.249 --> 37:38.512
Is there
a point to the color?

37:38.512 --> 37:40.851
There's a point to
everything, Ms. Dovecote,

37:40.851 --> 37:42.383
or to nothing at all.

37:42.383 --> 37:45.686
Which brings me
neatly to your proposal.

37:46.785 --> 37:48.554
Which one of you
actually wrote it?

37:48.554 --> 37:51.259
- Well, there was...
- I was inspired

37:51.259 --> 37:53.457
by Coriolanus yesterday,
of course.

37:53.457 --> 37:56.465
His little betting idea.

37:56.465 --> 38:00.631
But the sponsorships
and the gifts in the arena,

38:00.631 --> 38:02.538
- those were all mine.
- Clemmie?

38:04.538 --> 38:06.336
So it's your
sweaty handwriting

38:06.336 --> 38:07.670
on that page.

38:07.670 --> 38:10.378
Very impressive,
Ms. Dovecote.

38:10.378 --> 38:13.081
Unfortunately,
my assistant mistook it

38:13.081 --> 38:14.913
for trash this morning

38:14.913 --> 38:18.819
and lined the shelf
of this very terrarium with it.

38:18.819 --> 38:23.227
So, please, Ms. Dovecote,
retrieve it for us, won't you?

38:23.227 --> 38:26.793
So we might all consider
your inspired ideas.

38:28.459 --> 38:29.629
Don't worry,

38:29.629 --> 38:33.035
my little predators
are perfectly docile

38:33.035 --> 38:35.502
with those they can trust.

38:35.502 --> 38:37.901
So if they're
used to your scent,

38:37.901 --> 38:41.311
if you've handled
their food, for example,

38:41.311 --> 38:44.109
or if they've inhaled
the sweat of your palm

38:44.109 --> 38:46.345
on a page,

38:46.345 --> 38:47.814
they'll leave you alone.

38:48.448 --> 38:50.784
A new scent, however...

38:54.160 --> 38:57.194
you'd be on your own,
little girl.

38:57.194 --> 38:59.023
- Retrieve it.

39:02.096 --> 39:03.093
Clemmie.

39:11.335 --> 39:12.740
Clemmie, no! No!

39:15.609 --> 39:18.546
You asked about
the colors, Ms. Dovecote?

39:18.546 --> 39:21.610
I want my enemies to see
a rainbow of destruction

39:21.610 --> 39:23.279
engulfing the world.

39:23.279 --> 39:27.553
I'm not above using spectacle
to create a little terror.

39:27.553 --> 39:29.721
A strategy
your classmate here

39:29.721 --> 39:33.123
articulated very well
in his proposal.

39:34.398 --> 39:37.200
They're good,
your suggestions.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.896
I'm going to
recommend my team

39:38.896 --> 39:42.671
implement as many
as possible tomorrow.

39:44.336 --> 39:45.674
What?

39:47.011 --> 39:48.541
Will she die?

39:48.541 --> 39:50.512
The pleasure
in breaking ground

39:50.512 --> 39:53.713
in one's research
is one gets to find out.

39:53.713 --> 39:56.551
You better keep
Ms. Dovecote's fate between us.

39:56.551 --> 39:58.847
I don't think her mother
would be happy to learn

39:58.847 --> 40:01.052
how she caught
this sudden...

40:03.157 --> 40:04.460
flu.

40:04.460 --> 40:06.759
Now run along,
you have an arena to promote

40:06.759 --> 40:09.665
and it's time for
my milk and crackers.

40:23.942 --> 40:25.813
All right, let's go.

40:34.888 --> 40:36.593
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

40:39.464 --> 40:41.598
<i>- </i>
<i>- Enjoy the show.</i>

40:42.935 --> 40:44.733
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

40:45.234 --> 40:46.966
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

40:48.072 --> 40:51.608
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

40:55.874 --> 40:58.412
Come with me. Hey, you.

40:58.412 --> 41:00.881
Get that camera
on her. Coral.

41:25.909 --> 41:27.069
<i>Welcome to the arena</i>

41:27.069 --> 41:29.012
<i>for the 10th annual
Hunger Games.</i>

41:29.012 --> 41:30.541
<i>Tributes, mentors,</i>

41:30.541 --> 41:33.845
<i>you have 15 minutes
to survey the space
and discuss strategy.</i>

41:33.845 --> 41:36.686
Dill, you stick by me, understand?

41:40.190 --> 41:41.251
Hey, lumberjack.

41:43.094 --> 41:44.122
Lamina.

41:44.723 --> 41:46.058
No, no, just you.

41:46.932 --> 41:47.928
Just you.

41:59.845 --> 42:00.875
Jessup?

42:01.572 --> 42:03.141
Jessup.

42:05.444 --> 42:07.343
Please.

42:07.343 --> 42:10.217
Coriolanus, please don't let me
die in here tomorrow.

42:14.057 --> 42:15.087
Oh, shit!

42:49.926 --> 42:51.325
Help me!

42:55.498 --> 42:56.964
The gate's out!

42:59.401 --> 43:00.671
The gate's out.

43:01.470 --> 43:04.702
The gate's blown open.

43:18.851 --> 43:21.221
Come on, the gate's open.

43:22.391 --> 43:24.354
Come on. He wouldn't save you.

43:25.628 --> 43:27.859
We've got runners!

43:52.685 --> 43:53.889
Coryo.

43:56.523 --> 43:57.827
Lucy Gray?

43:58.827 --> 44:00.896
- Is she...
She's alive.

44:04.565 --> 44:05.862
What happened?

44:05.862 --> 44:07.232
It was a rebel bombing.

44:08.332 --> 44:11.604
They must have been
planning it for months.

44:11.604 --> 44:12.969
Four tributes were killed.

44:12.969 --> 44:16.076
Everyone's terrified, Coryo.

44:16.076 --> 44:19.977
People are locking themselves
inside their houses.

44:19.977 --> 44:22.819
Felix Ravinstill's
on life support.

44:24.389 --> 44:26.223
The rebels released a message.

44:26.223 --> 44:29.860
They said they wanted
to tear down the symbol of
the Hunger Games on live TV.

44:29.860 --> 44:32.359
<i>...savagely
and cowardly attacked us...</i>

44:32.359 --> 44:33.697
Marcus got out.

44:33.697 --> 44:34.661
<i>...gravely injuring
the president's...</i>

44:34.661 --> 44:35.929
He's the only one.

44:35.929 --> 44:38.800
Peacekeepers are hunting
him in the streets but

44:38.800 --> 44:40.636
at least he has
a better chance out there

44:40.636 --> 44:42.639
- than he would tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

44:42.639 --> 44:45.303
They're not still going ahead
with the Games?

44:46.244 --> 44:48.608
Oh, no, Lucy Gray.

44:48.608 --> 44:50.307
Lucy Gray could've run.

44:50.307 --> 44:53.550
<i>The show will go on.</i>
- But she saved me.

44:53.550 --> 44:55.113
<i>And now our final tribute.</i>

44:55.113 --> 44:58.518
<i>I first met this
young lady in the zoo</i>

44:58.518 --> 45:00.390
<i>not too long ago.</i>

45:00.390 --> 45:02.424
<i>- From District 12...</i>
- Coryo.

45:02.424 --> 45:04.090
<i>...Lucy Gray Baird.</i>

45:04.090 --> 45:06.530
<i>Come out here with
that guitar, you songbird.</i>

45:11.330 --> 45:15.738
<i>Good evening,
Capitol. Districts.</i>

45:15.738 --> 45:17.769
<i>I wrote this song
about a boy back in 12,</i>

45:17.769 --> 45:19.570
<i>and I hope he hears it.</i>

45:19.570 --> 45:24.407
<i>♪ When I was a babe
I fell down in the holler</i>

45:24.407 --> 45:28.182
<i>♪ When I was a girl
I fell into your arms</i>

45:28.182 --> 45:33.252
<i>♪ We fell on hard times
and we lost our bright color</i>

45:33.252 --> 45:39.159
<i>♪ You went to the dogs
and I lived by my charms</i>

45:40.492 --> 45:45.263
<i>♪ It's sooner than later
that I'm six feet under</i>

45:45.263 --> 45:49.164
<i>♪ It's sooner than later
that you'll be alone</i>

45:49.164 --> 45:51.869
<i>♪ So who will you turn to</i>

45:51.869 --> 45:54.274
<i>♪ Tomorrow, I wonder</i>

45:54.274 --> 46:00.180
<i>♪ For when the bell rings
Lover, you're on your own</i>

46:02.349 --> 46:06.582
<i>♪ I am the one
who you let see you weeping</i>

46:06.582 --> 46:10.653
<i>♪ I know the soul
that you struggle to save</i>

46:10.653 --> 46:15.695
<i>♪ Too bad I'm the bet
that you lost in the Reaping</i>

46:15.695 --> 46:17.863
<i>♪ Now what will you do</i>

46:17.863 --> 46:23.440
<i>♪ When I go to my grave ♪</i>

46:24.807 --> 46:26.839
<i>Ding, ding, ding.
Look at that.</i>

46:26.839 --> 46:28.238
<i>Record high for the evening.</i>

46:28.238 --> 46:30.176
<i>The Capitol
is definitely watching.</i>

46:30.176 --> 46:32.374
<i>People sending in donations.
See what happens</i>

46:32.374 --> 46:34.546
<i>- when you do stuff?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

46:34.546 --> 46:37.849
<i>Now, I don't love your odds,
but may they be in your favor.</i>

46:37.849 --> 46:39.183
Thank you for being here.

46:39.183 --> 46:41.356
<i>Ms. Lucy Gray, District 12.</i>

46:41.356 --> 46:42.217
Both of you.

46:42.217 --> 46:43.385
It's what friends do.

46:43.385 --> 46:45.261
<i>How wonderful is this night</i>

46:45.261 --> 46:47.629
<i>that we all get to be
here for someone's
final performance.</i>

46:47.629 --> 46:49.262
<i>Ms. Lucy Gray, thank you.</i>

46:49.262 --> 46:51.162
<i>Go home, go to bed,
get a good night's sleep.</i>

46:51.162 --> 46:52.969
<i>You've got
a big day tomorrow.</i>

48:01.870 --> 48:03.204
<i>Lucy Gray.</i>

48:03.902 --> 48:05.140
Lucy Gray.

48:05.807 --> 48:08.273
- Hey.
- You're alive.

48:08.273 --> 48:11.481
Those bombs,
they have changed everything.

48:11.481 --> 48:13.147
They blew the walls out.

48:13.147 --> 48:15.784
So that means you can escape
up into the stands.

48:15.784 --> 48:17.480
There's a hole
down in the floor.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.217
Leads down to some tunnels.
I've tried it

48:19.217 --> 48:21.051
and you can
disappear down there.

48:21.051 --> 48:24.521
So the moment you hear
that bell ring, you ignore
the weapons in the middle

48:24.521 --> 48:28.162
and you run
as fast as you can
for that hole.

48:28.162 --> 48:31.331
And you find a place
to hide down below. Alone.

48:32.130 --> 48:33.196
- Alone? No.
- Yeah.

48:33.196 --> 48:34.565
- Jessup's my friend.
- No.

48:34.565 --> 48:36.603
The moment that bell rings,
you can't trust anyone.

48:36.603 --> 48:38.107
Not even Jessup.

48:39.506 --> 48:41.975
Just lay low down there
until it's safe to come out.

48:41.975 --> 48:45.147
Thank you for
taking care of me.

48:46.144 --> 48:47.677
I can't let you die.

48:48.618 --> 48:50.520
You saved me.

48:50.520 --> 48:53.056
You saved me, Lucy Gray.

48:55.857 --> 48:58.124
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

48:58.124 --> 48:59.993
I'm more hopeful
during the daytime,

48:59.993 --> 49:01.825
but when it gets dark,
I just...

49:01.825 --> 49:03.066
It's okay.

49:06.305 --> 49:07.301
It's okay.

49:09.774 --> 49:11.602
I am gonna get you
out of here.

49:12.773 --> 49:13.769
I promise.

49:16.548 --> 49:18.345
Back to the Covey, okay?

49:30.726 --> 49:31.721
Is this real?

49:33.762 --> 49:34.964
Just tell me.

49:34.964 --> 49:38.395
If I'm gonna risk everything.
That song...

49:38.395 --> 49:41.198
That song was payback,
that's all.

49:41.198 --> 49:42.533
My old boyfriend, Billy Taupe,

49:42.533 --> 49:44.471
he was cheating on me
with the mayor's daughter.

49:44.471 --> 49:46.668
- The girl from the Reaping.
- Yeah, she got crazy jealous.

49:46.668 --> 49:48.473
She had her pa read my name
up on that stage

49:48.473 --> 49:51.114
and now everyone will know
what they did to me.

49:54.847 --> 49:56.053
Here.

49:58.149 --> 49:59.483
You take this.

49:59.483 --> 50:02.117
- No, no, it's too fine.
- No, it is not a gift.

50:02.117 --> 50:03.825
It's a loan.

50:03.825 --> 50:05.859
What's in here, don't touch it.

50:05.859 --> 50:07.061
Don't even breathe it in

50:07.061 --> 50:08.461
because small amounts
can be deadly.

50:10.135 --> 50:13.403
Look, I have seen what war
does to people, okay?

50:13.403 --> 50:14.565
I've seen it.

50:14.565 --> 50:17.101
And there will come a time
when you need this.

50:17.101 --> 50:19.404
When you need to act.

50:19.404 --> 50:22.145
We all do things
we're not proud of to survive.

50:24.008 --> 50:25.847
Hey.

50:25.847 --> 50:28.811
We are gonna win
this, Lucy Gray.

50:30.953 --> 50:32.518
We're gonna win this together.

50:47.136 --> 50:48.864
Wake up! On your feet!

50:50.100 --> 50:51.339
Jessup.

51:05.990 --> 51:08.486
That friend of yours. Plinth.

51:08.486 --> 51:11.722
You might wanna find him
a seat near the door.

51:15.127 --> 51:16.661
Coryo.

51:17.662 --> 51:19.428
- Hey.
- How you doing?
You all right?

51:19.428 --> 51:20.731
- Better.
Over here, please.

51:24.134 --> 51:25.340
Better.

51:28.980 --> 51:30.840
Tell me this
will be over quickly.

51:33.783 --> 51:35.919
What is this? The mines?

51:35.919 --> 51:38.452
I... I gotta
get my tools. Pa said...

51:41.057 --> 51:42.253
<i>Here we go.
Here we go, everyone.</i>

51:42.253 --> 51:44.155
Come on. Come on, let's go.

51:44.155 --> 51:45.457
Sit down, Festus, come on.

51:45.457 --> 51:49.030
Everyone, as you know,
we're about to go live.

51:49.030 --> 51:50.396
Just because
you're not hosting,

51:50.396 --> 51:52.298
doesn't mean you're
off the hook. Help me.

51:52.298 --> 51:54.133
Don't get lost
behind your screens.

51:54.133 --> 51:56.172
No yawning, no gum chewing.

51:56.172 --> 51:59.442
Keep your chins down,
heads up, shoulders back.

51:59.442 --> 52:00.941
And smile.

52:00.941 --> 52:02.608
It's why we have teeth.

52:03.982 --> 52:05.977
Okay. Ready?
We're gonna start, guys.

52:05.977 --> 52:08.276
Five, four,

52:08.276 --> 52:10.085
three, two...

52:18.725 --> 52:23.900
Good morning, I'm Lucretius
"Lucky" Flickerman.

52:23.900 --> 52:26.330
A man who
needs no introduction.

52:26.330 --> 52:28.999
Weatherman, amateur magician,

52:28.999 --> 52:30.504
and today,

52:32.403 --> 52:34.373
I'm honored to say...

52:34.373 --> 52:37.814
first ever host
of the Hunger Games.

52:39.212 --> 52:41.678
In my hand,
an envelope, sealed.

52:41.678 --> 52:45.051
My prediction, the winner
to be opened by me

52:45.051 --> 52:46.581
upon the big show's end.

52:46.581 --> 52:48.420
- Well, well...

52:48.420 --> 52:49.485
They're here.
We're getting word...

52:49.485 --> 52:50.687
All right, we're about to start.

52:50.687 --> 52:51.995
We're starting, everyone,
we're starting.

52:51.995 --> 52:53.362
Happy Hunger Games.
Happy Hunger...

52:53.362 --> 52:55.727
Remember, when
your tribute dies,
get out of here.

53:02.470 --> 53:03.799
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

53:03.799 --> 53:06.408
<i>- </i>
<i>- Enjoy the show.</i>

53:09.813 --> 53:11.143
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

53:29.995 --> 53:33.369
<i>Stand on your mark
or you will be shot.</i>

53:38.004 --> 53:39.001
Move.

54:14.506 --> 54:17.206
- Ooh! Marcus.

54:17.206 --> 54:20.614
Guess we can
all sleep better now
knowing he's off the streets.

54:22.886 --> 54:24.115
You're monsters!

54:24.115 --> 54:25.784
All of you!

54:31.421 --> 54:34.395
Ten, nine...

54:34.395 --> 54:38.665
-  ... <i>eight, seven, six,</i>

54:39.496 --> 54:41.033
<i>- five...</i>
- Jessup.

54:41.033 --> 54:42.471
<i>...four,</i>

54:43.105 --> 54:45.005
<i>- three...</i>
- Jessup.

54:45.005 --> 54:46.475
<i>...two,</i>

54:47.139 --> 54:48.436
<i>one.</i>

54:50.812 --> 54:51.706
Run.

54:55.149 --> 54:56.353
Jessup!

54:56.984 --> 54:58.418
Jessup!

54:58.418 --> 55:00.151
What
are you doing? Run.

55:06.288 --> 55:07.529
Jess...

55:14.670 --> 55:15.737
Jessup!

55:40.225 --> 55:41.530
Jessup!

55:53.271 --> 55:54.510
Jessup!

55:55.378 --> 55:57.172
Jessup! Jessup,
we gotta go, come on.

55:57.172 --> 55:59.009
We should get out of here.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

56:03.619 --> 56:05.186
They've gone
underground very quickly,

56:05.186 --> 56:06.655
but we're prepared for this.

56:06.655 --> 56:07.784
-  Go, go, go.
What
you're seeing now

56:07.784 --> 56:09.487
is a live feed
of security cameras.

56:09.487 --> 56:11.659
- Come on!

56:14.259 --> 56:15.291
Come on!

56:16.899 --> 56:18.127
Go, go, go.

56:21.234 --> 56:22.436
This way.

56:22.436 --> 56:23.665
Hy and Sol
from the other side,

56:23.665 --> 56:25.101
pincering in on Lucy Gray.

56:27.109 --> 56:28.137
Come on.

56:33.683 --> 56:35.816
No! Please, no!

56:35.816 --> 56:36.981
No!

56:36.981 --> 56:39.547
Here comes the Pack,
surprising Hy and Sol.

56:41.123 --> 56:42.492
-  No!

56:43.255 --> 56:44.593
Come on.

56:51.294 --> 56:54.029
Hey, lumberjack,
get in there and get her out.

56:54.029 --> 56:55.634
I'm not
sticking my head in there.

56:55.634 --> 56:57.167
She could be
waiting with a brick.

56:57.167 --> 57:00.103
<i>I knew we should have
recruited that Reaper kid.</i>

57:06.944 --> 57:08.518
Do you think they're done?

57:10.185 --> 57:11.246
Looks like it.

57:12.853 --> 57:15.420
To the children watching,
that was violent,

57:15.420 --> 57:18.223
horrific, and disgusting.

57:18.223 --> 57:19.826
Ms. Phipps,

57:19.826 --> 57:23.197
please, if you're going
to vomit, do it off camera.

57:23.197 --> 57:24.896
Thirteen tributes remain.

57:24.896 --> 57:28.030
Reaper still looming large
on top of the charts

57:28.030 --> 57:30.700
while Coral and her Pack
try to make a play.

57:30.700 --> 57:33.637
Six tributes gone in minutes.

57:33.637 --> 57:35.608
If they keep it up at this pace,

57:35.608 --> 57:37.679
we're gonna be
outta here in no time.

57:39.009 --> 57:41.416
Now, these record
high temperatures

57:41.416 --> 57:43.078
aren't doing that
fire that continues

57:43.078 --> 57:46.121
to burn out here
in District 9 any favors.

57:46.121 --> 57:47.417
I'll keep an eye on it.

57:47.417 --> 57:48.888
In District 10,

57:48.888 --> 57:52.260
this warm front is gonna
come down and collide here,

57:52.260 --> 57:53.790
squeezing out some drizzle.

57:53.790 --> 57:57.298
And finally,
in District 12, a...

58:02.567 --> 58:04.068
Lamina.

58:42.176 --> 58:43.580
Please.

58:44.849 --> 58:46.176
Please.

59:04.464 --> 59:06.064
-  Yes!

59:16.204 --> 59:18.242
Cold pressure
system's gonna swoop on in,

59:18.242 --> 59:21.014
bringing cooler temperatures
and some much needed relief

59:21.014 --> 59:24.119
to our coal miners out there,
at least until early evening.

59:24.119 --> 59:25.815
That's the weather.

59:25.815 --> 59:28.383
Was it mercy?
Was it murder?

59:29.859 --> 59:32.761
Either way, that's what
happens when you do stuff.

59:33.493 --> 59:34.928
You get attention.

59:36.134 --> 59:37.398
Citizens send you money.

59:37.398 --> 59:39.128
Now, once they get your money,

59:39.128 --> 59:43.067
the mentor can choose
to send in food or water

59:43.067 --> 59:45.936
using our newly developed
drones from the war,

59:45.936 --> 59:48.009
reprogrammed
with facial recognition.

59:48.009 --> 59:52.007
This ensures
that your package goes
directly to your tribute.

59:52.007 --> 59:53.949
Isn't that right,
Pup Harrington?

59:53.949 --> 59:55.377
Yeah.

59:55.377 --> 59:58.748
I've got a hunch Pup is gonna
seize the opportunity.

01:00:16.737 --> 01:00:18.174
- What?

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:37.656
Uh, we have a reservation
tonight. Flickerman.

01:00:37.656 --> 01:00:39.090
Party of two and a high chair.

01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.498
We will not be there, um,
on time. I'm sorry.

01:00:42.498 --> 01:00:43.992
I'm... I'm hosting
the Hunger Games...

01:00:43.992 --> 01:00:45.361
- 10th annual,

01:00:45.361 --> 01:00:47.698
and it's going a little bit
longer than anticipated,

01:00:47.698 --> 01:00:48.867
so I'm curious to know

01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:51.098
if you have
anything later tonight.

01:00:51.098 --> 01:00:53.141
You do. Great.
I will be there.

01:00:53.141 --> 01:00:54.203
Because this...

01:00:54.203 --> 01:00:56.578
If not... If you don't see me,
I'm not there.

01:00:56.578 --> 01:00:59.045
You can't
save her by watching.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:01.913
What do you
want from that girl?

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:03.852
- Nothing. I want her to live.
- Mmm.

01:01:05.449 --> 01:01:08.155
And the Plinth Prize would be
a happy coincidence,

01:01:08.155 --> 01:01:09.187
I suppose.

01:01:11.529 --> 01:01:14.225
I believe
I'd be entitled to it.

01:01:15.258 --> 01:01:17.998
Of course you do.
Of course you do.

01:01:19.831 --> 01:01:21.938
The prize, the girl.

01:01:21.938 --> 01:01:24.871
Hmm, how convenient.
You don't have to
choose between them.

01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:27.103
Who do you think
makes that final decision

01:01:27.103 --> 01:01:30.243
for the prize
you so covet, Mr. Snow?

01:01:30.243 --> 01:01:31.779
Wake up.

01:01:31.779 --> 01:01:34.882
Even if Lucy Gray Baird
somehow wins it all,

01:01:34.882 --> 01:01:37.319
I will do everything
in my power to ensure that

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:40.020
you don't see a dime.

01:01:40.686 --> 01:01:42.723
So, ask yourself,

01:01:42.723 --> 01:01:45.190
how much do you care
if she lives now?

01:01:57.166 --> 01:01:59.402
We gotta be quiet
down here, Jessup.

01:02:00.278 --> 01:02:01.705
I just wanna sleep.

01:02:01.705 --> 01:02:03.142
You want some water?

01:02:12.357 --> 01:02:14.184
What have you done to it?

01:02:14.184 --> 01:02:16.793
I didn't do anything,
Jessup, I just...

01:02:17.657 --> 01:02:19.059
Are you okay?

01:02:20.494 --> 01:02:21.490
It's okay.

01:02:24.133 --> 01:02:26.402
Jessup, come on.

01:02:26.402 --> 01:02:28.934
Let's go back to sleep, okay?

01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:32.572
I know, I know.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:02:39.977 --> 01:02:41.543
Mr. Snow.

01:02:42.649 --> 01:02:43.853
What happened?

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:45.954
Is it Lucy Gray?

01:02:45.954 --> 01:02:49.287
Unless you can put a leash
on your deluded classmate,

01:02:49.287 --> 01:02:52.829
she might as well be dead
as far as you're concerned.

01:02:54.692 --> 01:02:55.991
Sejanus?

01:02:55.991 --> 01:02:58.533
Bread crumbs. I believe

01:02:58.533 --> 01:03:00.402
sustenance for
a fallen comrade

01:03:00.402 --> 01:03:01.799
on his final journey.

01:03:01.799 --> 01:03:03.773
A District 2 superstition.

01:03:03.773 --> 01:03:06.170
I'll work on finding
the Peacekeeper he bribed

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:08.738
to get him in,
and cut out their tongue.

01:03:08.738 --> 01:03:10.812
In the meantime,

01:03:10.812 --> 01:03:14.208
I need someone
to get him out right now.

01:03:14.208 --> 01:03:16.015
You should send
Peacekeepers in.

01:03:16.015 --> 01:03:19.655
Only to have him bolt
and hide like a rabbit?

01:03:19.655 --> 01:03:21.819
Felix Ravinstill
is fighting for his life

01:03:21.819 --> 01:03:23.860
in the hospital, Mr. Snow.

01:03:23.860 --> 01:03:26.492
I will not have these rebels
make a further mockery

01:03:26.492 --> 01:03:28.159
of my Games.

01:03:28.159 --> 01:03:31.197
Anyone sees us
lose control of this arena,

01:03:31.197 --> 01:03:34.235
it might as well be sounding
a horn to the districts

01:03:34.235 --> 01:03:35.432
to revolt.

01:03:36.334 --> 01:03:38.974
You choose to be friends
with this radical.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:42.043
You want him
to end the Games tonight?

01:03:42.043 --> 01:03:44.643
It'll look a lot worse
if the tributes kill two of us.

01:03:44.643 --> 01:03:46.880
So don't let them.

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:50.412
Who knows?
You get him out unscathed,

01:03:50.412 --> 01:03:53.582
I'll whisper your name
in his father's ear.

01:03:54.892 --> 01:03:57.190
You still want
that Plinth Prize, don't you?

01:03:58.289 --> 01:04:00.963
I'll freeze the feed
for an hour.

01:04:00.963 --> 01:04:04.665
I estimate that's all we have
until the people notice.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:31.921
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:22.539
I thought they'd send my ma.

01:05:23.778 --> 01:05:25.311
Yeah, I wish they had.

01:05:30.015 --> 01:05:31.147
You need to go, Coryo.

01:05:31.147 --> 01:05:33.622
I'd like to. I really would.

01:05:33.622 --> 01:05:35.288
But I promised
I'd get you out.

01:05:36.293 --> 01:05:37.356
Why?

01:05:38.156 --> 01:05:40.557
Because you're my friend.

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:43.226
I have to do this.
I had to go where
the cameras are.

01:05:43.226 --> 01:05:45.863
You think
anyone's watching this?

01:05:45.863 --> 01:05:47.731
Gaul cut the feed.

01:05:47.731 --> 01:05:51.165
Tributes kill you in here,
she's just gonna
say you died of the flu.

01:05:54.877 --> 01:05:58.143
You need to decide
right now.

01:05:58.143 --> 01:05:59.877
Do you wanna
fight these tributes,

01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:01.278
or fight for them?

01:06:01.278 --> 01:06:02.949
Because if you wanna
make real change,

01:06:02.949 --> 01:06:04.216
you need to
stay alive to do it.

01:06:04.216 --> 01:06:06.520
How can I make
any change from out there?

01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.950
You're rich.

01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:10.519
Smart. You care.

01:06:10.519 --> 01:06:12.055
You're the only one
who stood up to Gaul

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:13.422
in that class, right?

01:06:17.394 --> 01:06:20.361
We're dead
if we don't leave
right now.

01:06:20.361 --> 01:06:22.597
- Come with me.

01:06:22.597 --> 01:06:26.107
Spend your father's money,
do some real good.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:28.539
Or just be
another dead body
in Gaul's war.

01:06:29.907 --> 01:06:31.113
Please.

01:06:31.877 --> 01:06:33.082
Trust me.

01:06:34.813 --> 01:06:35.810
I...

01:06:37.484 --> 01:06:38.882
Go! Go!

01:06:42.425 --> 01:06:43.457
Run!

01:06:52.033 --> 01:06:54.098
- Come on, get up!
To the gate!

01:06:59.168 --> 01:07:00.302
I don't wanna hurt you!

01:07:03.538 --> 01:07:05.877
<i>Enjoy the show.</i>

01:07:18.991 --> 01:07:20.195
Come on, get up.

01:07:22.359 --> 01:07:23.591
Go!
Move it!

01:07:23.591 --> 01:07:26.564
Open the gate!
Open the gate!

01:07:34.504 --> 01:07:36.505
Watch those
screens, gorgeous.

01:07:36.505 --> 01:07:39.541
'Cause I may
have missed you tonight,

01:07:39.541 --> 01:07:41.711
but your songbird's
next on my list.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:44.351
Let's go.

01:07:49.658 --> 01:07:50.922
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:07:50.922 --> 01:07:52.692
Coryo, I'm so sorry.

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:53.756
I'm so sorry.

01:07:54.631 --> 01:07:55.659
For all of it.

01:08:02.539 --> 01:08:03.601
My father.

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:06.670
Let the buying begin.

01:08:15.683 --> 01:08:16.680
Ma!

01:08:19.054 --> 01:08:21.322
I had to do something.

01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:33.602
Snow stormed down,

01:08:33.602 --> 01:08:34.968
down on his head.

01:08:34.968 --> 01:08:37.170
It stormed down on his head,

01:08:37.170 --> 01:08:40.607
and now the boy is...

01:08:45.149 --> 01:08:47.942
You've had enough
of the Games tonight, I see.

01:08:49.652 --> 01:08:51.015
Come, sit.

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:52.320
I'll stitch you up.

01:08:53.321 --> 01:08:56.520
Who could imagine
Crassus Snow's baby boy

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.921
fighting for his life
in the arena one day?

01:09:02.398 --> 01:09:06.501
What happened in there,
that's humanity undressed.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:11.435
Fueled with the terror
of becoming prey,

01:09:11.435 --> 01:09:15.208
see how quickly
we become predator.

01:09:15.208 --> 01:09:19.146
See how quickly
civilization disappears.

01:09:19.146 --> 01:09:21.013
Those tributes
don't have a choice.

01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:22.713
I was talking about you.

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:27.649
All your fine manners,
education, background,

01:09:27.649 --> 01:09:30.755
stripped away
in the blink of an eye,

01:09:30.755 --> 01:09:34.123
leaving a boy with a club
who beats another boy to death

01:09:34.123 --> 01:09:35.726
to stay alive.

01:09:41.236 --> 01:09:44.940
You wanna protect
people, Mr. Snow?

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:46.902
To govern them
like your father?

01:09:48.807 --> 01:09:52.574
Then it's essential you accept
what human beings are

01:09:52.574 --> 01:09:54.877
and what it takes
to control them.

01:10:12.928 --> 01:10:15.766
They sent me into the arena
tonight, Tigris.

01:10:16.199 --> 01:10:17.871
What?

01:10:17.871 --> 01:10:19.506
To get Sejanus out.

01:10:20.603 --> 01:10:23.076
What happened? Are you okay?

01:10:23.076 --> 01:10:24.742
I killed
one of the tributes.

01:10:26.517 --> 01:10:27.547
A boy.

01:10:28.885 --> 01:10:31.045
It must have been awful.

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:32.849
It was.

01:10:35.187 --> 01:10:36.853
Then it felt...

01:10:39.025 --> 01:10:40.395
powerful.

01:10:43.798 --> 01:10:44.861
Coryo.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:48.829
I know you wanna
be like your father

01:10:48.829 --> 01:10:53.941
but what I remember
the most about him

01:10:53.941 --> 01:10:56.811
was that in his eyes,

01:10:56.811 --> 01:10:59.279
it was just hate.

01:10:59.279 --> 01:11:01.111
You don't have to
pay the same price

01:11:01.111 --> 01:11:03.051
just to survive.

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:04.881
- People can be good.

01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:09.688
You can be good. You are good.

01:11:10.454 --> 01:11:12.053
Just believe in that.

01:11:17.027 --> 01:11:19.929
<i>Wakey wakey,
my Capitol friends.</i>

01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:23.171
<i>I'm Lucky Flickerman
and welcome to day number two</i>

01:11:23.171 --> 01:11:25.134
<i>of the 10th annual
Hunger Games.</i>

01:11:25.134 --> 01:11:28.802
Now, while most of you
were getting your
beauty sleep last night,

01:11:28.802 --> 01:11:31.374
something
scintillating occurred.

01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:33.575
Bobbin from District 8,

01:11:33.575 --> 01:11:34.977
- slaughtered.

01:11:34.977 --> 01:11:37.512
- Which of these beasts slayed

01:11:37.512 --> 01:11:39.086
Bobbin from District 8?

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:40.316
Either way, it doesn't matter.

01:11:40.316 --> 01:11:41.486
10 tributes remain.

01:11:41.486 --> 01:11:44.156
Reaper still at the top
of the boards.

01:11:44.156 --> 01:11:45.292
They aren't showing us

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:46.655
what happened
to that little boy.

01:11:46.655 --> 01:11:48.023
He clearly
was killed right there.

01:11:48.023 --> 01:11:49.859
There's cameras everywhere.
It doesn't make sense.

01:11:49.859 --> 01:11:52.134
They said they were
old cameras, Lyssie.

01:11:52.134 --> 01:11:53.528
Probably just
another one of Coral's.

01:11:53.528 --> 01:11:55.437
Festus, sit down.

01:11:56.234 --> 01:11:57.439
Same seats.

01:12:10.043 --> 01:12:12.052
<i>What'd you do to me?</i>
<i>Nothing!</i>

01:12:12.052 --> 01:12:13.686
Lyssie, what is he doing?

01:12:13.686 --> 01:12:16.158
Something's wrong.
He wouldn't turn
on her like this.

01:12:16.158 --> 01:12:17.522
Jessup going after Lucy Gray.

01:12:17.522 --> 01:12:18.920
Go to the stands,
go to the stands.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.829
- Stop running!
What did you...

01:12:22.022 --> 01:12:24.799
- What did you do to me?
- I didn't do anything.

01:12:25.761 --> 01:12:28.237
Both tributes from District 12.

01:12:28.237 --> 01:12:31.036
The same district
folding in on itself.

01:12:31.036 --> 01:12:32.267
Wait, look.

01:12:32.267 --> 01:12:33.406
The foam.

01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:34.403
<i>I didn't do anything to you!</i>

01:12:34.403 --> 01:12:35.978
I think it's rabies.

01:12:35.978 --> 01:12:38.505
That bite. From that train.

01:12:38.505 --> 01:12:40.111
Send him water.

01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:41.282
Wait, what?

01:12:41.282 --> 01:12:43.849
You remember
the posters in the war?

01:12:43.849 --> 01:12:46.681
Rabies. It makes you afraid
of water. Send him a drone.

01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:48.889
- That'll scare him.
- Yes.

01:12:48.889 --> 01:12:50.792
Away from her.

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:52.088
Jessup is done.

01:12:52.088 --> 01:12:54.991
Lyssie, you're the only one
that can get it right to him.

01:12:56.599 --> 01:12:59.294
<i>Ms. Vickers going
for her communipad early.</i>

01:12:59.294 --> 01:13:00.595
Thank you.

01:13:00.595 --> 01:13:02.234
Sending a drone.

01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:03.403
Nothing to be proud of.

01:13:03.403 --> 01:13:05.900
- Please, please, please!

01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.174
- What's wrong with me?

01:13:08.174 --> 01:13:09.745
What did you do to me?

01:13:15.285 --> 01:13:17.948
Oh!

01:13:22.718 --> 01:13:24.086
- Jessup?

01:13:36.567 --> 01:13:38.507
I'm not going anywhere.

01:13:39.303 --> 01:13:40.509
Okay?

01:13:42.875 --> 01:13:45.445
You watched over me,
now I'm watching over you.

01:13:45.445 --> 01:13:48.847
- Sleep now, Jessup, sleep.

01:13:57.794 --> 01:13:59.121
Okay.

01:14:13.703 --> 01:14:15.803
Here we go.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.977
Oh, no!

01:14:21.616 --> 01:14:23.744
Lucy Gray.

01:14:23.744 --> 01:14:25.521
You stay right there.

01:14:29.057 --> 01:14:30.117
Oh, look at this.

01:14:30.117 --> 01:14:32.656
The Pack doing what they
do best. Packing it in.

01:14:32.656 --> 01:14:34.660
Lucy Gray is
swarmed, cornered.

01:14:34.660 --> 01:14:37.398
- Mizzen, propellering his net.

01:14:37.398 --> 01:14:39.964
Mr. Snow going
for his communipad.

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:48.569
Hey, Coral, do you mind
if I take this one?

01:14:48.569 --> 01:14:49.639
Not a chance.

01:15:08.494 --> 01:15:09.958
These drones
are not very good.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:12.298
Hey! You can't
attack the tributes.

01:15:12.298 --> 01:15:13.701
I'm just sending water.

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:28.676
You idiots.

01:15:28.676 --> 01:15:32.786
- How did you possibly
let her get away?
I couldn't see a thing.

01:15:34.587 --> 01:15:36.988
Get this water
into a pile, lumberjack.

01:15:36.988 --> 01:15:40.895
And then when you're done,
you two can watch that beam

01:15:40.895 --> 01:15:43.995
while we get your
little friend from back
home up there at least.

01:15:53.206 --> 01:15:54.203
Now.

01:16:13.392 --> 01:16:14.729
Do it now.

01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:35.576
Again, a fall...

01:17:35.576 --> 01:17:39.209
- ...ending a tribute's game.

01:17:40.610 --> 01:17:41.849
Wake up.

01:17:43.452 --> 01:17:45.719
Lucy Gray on the move.

01:17:45.719 --> 01:17:47.783
And so is Pup Harrington.
Thank you, Pup.

01:18:13.912 --> 01:18:15.509
- You're useless.

01:18:20.019 --> 01:18:22.849
Now, I wish we had
a camera inside of the duct,

01:18:22.849 --> 01:18:24.259
but we don't.

01:18:24.259 --> 01:18:26.520
But we will next year.

01:18:31.530 --> 01:18:32.526
Hey.

01:18:34.134 --> 01:18:36.497
You really think you deserve
that water now, Tanner?

01:18:41.710 --> 01:18:46.312
Look, you just
said watch the beam.

01:18:59.127 --> 01:19:00.260
Coral.

01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:01.291
It's Wovey.

01:19:02.497 --> 01:19:03.931
The little one from 8.

01:19:04.499 --> 01:19:05.834
This should be easy.

01:19:12.033 --> 01:19:13.936
Seven tributes remain.

01:19:13.936 --> 01:19:16.139
Merciless Mizzen, Cunning Coral,

01:19:16.139 --> 01:19:18.010
Treacherous Treech, Dill,
Reaper, of course,

01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:22.314
and the lone wolves,
little Wovey and Lucy Gray.

01:19:33.089 --> 01:19:34.456
And who do we have here?

01:19:35.364 --> 01:19:37.431
Ah! It's ill Dill.

01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:39.296
Tuberculosis on legs.

01:20:11.367 --> 01:20:12.362
Dill?

01:20:14.137 --> 01:20:15.134
Dill?

01:20:16.537 --> 01:20:17.598
Dill, wake up.

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:21.437
Dill.

01:20:21.837 --> 01:20:23.076
No.

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.144
What happened?

01:20:26.281 --> 01:20:27.311
Dill?

01:20:27.777 --> 01:20:28.983
Dill?

01:20:29.581 --> 01:20:30.578
Hey.

01:20:31.586 --> 01:20:33.451
Dill, hey, wake up.

01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:34.483
Dill.

01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:36.518
Dill!

01:20:42.961 --> 01:20:44.660
I'm so sorry.

01:21:48.827 --> 01:21:50.592
He just tore down the flag.

01:22:16.021 --> 01:22:17.652
<i>Are you gonna punish me now?</i>

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.958
<i>Are you going
to punish me n...</i>

01:22:25.964 --> 01:22:27.396
<i>Capitol citizens,</i>

01:22:27.396 --> 01:22:29.901
<i>I'm afraid I must
interrupt our Games</i>

01:22:29.901 --> 01:22:32.034
<i>to announce a tragic loss,</i>

01:22:32.034 --> 01:22:34.272
<i>one that affects us all.</i>

01:22:34.272 --> 01:22:38.540
<i>Felix Ravinstill, son of
our beloved president...</i>

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.241
<i>- </i>
<i>- ...has, this morning,</i>

01:22:40.241 --> 01:22:41.915
<i>succumbed to his injuries</i>

01:22:41.915 --> 01:22:44.883
<i>sustained in
the rebel bombing.</i>

01:22:44.883 --> 01:22:47.549
<i>Out there in the districts,</i>

01:22:47.549 --> 01:22:50.491
<i>they will be celebrating
this young boy's death</i>

01:22:50.491 --> 01:22:52.055
<i>as a triumph.</i>

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:54.961
<i>I will not allow my Games</i>

01:22:54.961 --> 01:22:58.193
<i>to give our enemy
such a victory.</i>

01:22:58.193 --> 01:23:00.934
<i>I swear to you, here and now,</i>

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:04.302
<i>before the sun
goes down tonight,</i>

01:23:04.302 --> 01:23:08.341
<i>a rainbow of destruction
will engulf our arena.</i>

01:23:08.341 --> 01:23:12.876
<i>Even if it means
there's to be no victor
in these Games.</i>

01:23:17.382 --> 01:23:20.253
Get me a drink.
Get me a drink right now.

01:23:41.106 --> 01:23:44.079
I need to see
Dr. Gaul immediately.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.251
Hey. Go get a spear.
Go up there.

01:23:53.251 --> 01:23:56.091
Push her back as much
as possible. Trust me.

01:24:00.158 --> 01:24:02.130
Come to beg for her life?

01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:04.561
No.

01:24:05.502 --> 01:24:07.667
No, my stitches,

01:24:07.667 --> 01:24:09.762
they broke loose.

01:24:09.762 --> 01:24:12.136
I didn't want the doctors
asking questions.

01:24:12.136 --> 01:24:14.268
- Come, sit.

01:24:14.268 --> 01:24:15.671
Pull down your shirt.

01:24:30.692 --> 01:24:32.792
Shh. Quiet.

01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:35.328
She's up here somewhere.

01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:38.027
This might hurt.

01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:52.110
Jabberjays we call them.

01:24:52.110 --> 01:24:54.079
We sent them
out during the war

01:24:54.079 --> 01:24:55.983
to pick up
rebel conversations,

01:24:55.983 --> 01:24:59.187
squawk it back to us
word for word.

01:24:59.587 --> 01:25:00.584
Watch.

01:25:06.689 --> 01:25:10.559
A failed experiment,
but an instructive one.

01:25:10.559 --> 01:25:12.826
I'm rounding them up
district by district now

01:25:12.826 --> 01:25:16.336
to see what better purposes
they might serve.

01:25:17.568 --> 01:25:19.234
A failed experiment,

01:25:19.234 --> 01:25:20.838
but an instructive one.

01:25:29.216 --> 01:25:30.911
Here, birdy, birdy, birdy.

01:25:38.319 --> 01:25:39.689
Don't be scared.

01:25:40.190 --> 01:25:41.592
Don't run away.

01:25:42.964 --> 01:25:44.794
Lucy.

01:25:44.794 --> 01:25:48.496
I'll see you in the auditorium
for the finale, Mr. Snow.

01:25:48.496 --> 01:25:50.864
You should be
proud of yourself.

01:25:50.864 --> 01:25:55.210
Your songbird, Lucy Gray,
put on a wonderful show.

01:26:40.953 --> 01:26:43.885
Shh. Quiet, quiet. Listen.

01:27:07.817 --> 01:27:08.811
Coral.

01:27:17.685 --> 01:27:18.925
Lucy Gray, is she okay?

01:27:18.925 --> 01:27:20.460
She won't be for long.

01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:24.761
I've got you now, songbird.

01:27:25.535 --> 01:27:26.361
Wait.

01:27:26.361 --> 01:27:27.896
What's wrong with Treech?

01:27:34.668 --> 01:27:37.274
Did Coral do
something to Treech?

01:27:44.984 --> 01:27:46.249
Run. Run.

01:27:46.249 --> 01:27:47.586
What did she do to him?

01:27:50.456 --> 01:27:52.960
Dissension in the ranks.
Treech is down.

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.661
Good afternoon, Ms. Sickle.

01:28:38.975 --> 01:28:41.409
That is not gonna be good.

01:28:43.271 --> 01:28:45.105
Work, please.

01:28:49.779 --> 01:28:52.013
Wouldn't it be fun
if it was candy?

01:28:56.552 --> 01:28:58.687
Is it over?

01:28:58.687 --> 01:29:01.722
- Can we go home now?
Wovey.

01:29:01.722 --> 01:29:03.596
- Wovey.
Please!

01:29:04.834 --> 01:29:06.527
Wovey.

01:29:06.527 --> 01:29:07.798
- Wovey.

01:29:11.767 --> 01:29:14.508
- Not candy!
Down goes Wovey.

01:29:26.214 --> 01:29:27.752
Help!

01:29:28.386 --> 01:29:29.418
- Mizzen,

01:29:29.418 --> 01:29:30.656
- say goodbye!
- Yes!

01:29:41.532 --> 01:29:44.167
Lucy Gray, wait!

01:29:48.377 --> 01:29:49.941
<i>Lucy, I'm begging you!</i>

01:29:52.043 --> 01:29:53.074
It's not fair.

01:29:53.915 --> 01:29:55.514
It's not.

01:29:55.514 --> 01:29:57.815
I can't have killed
them all for nothing.

01:30:06.493 --> 01:30:08.125
- And that is good-bye

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:09.259
to Festus Creed.

01:30:09.259 --> 01:30:10.823
Have a nice summer.

01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:15.228
Now, all colors lead to Gray.

01:30:20.537 --> 01:30:22.136
She's... She's won.

01:30:23.177 --> 01:30:25.078
It's over, she's won.

01:30:25.078 --> 01:30:26.172
She's won, let her out.

01:30:26.172 --> 01:30:28.948
Afraid that's not your call
to make, Mr. Snow.

01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.331
<i>♪ You're headed for heaven</i>

01:33:28.224 --> 01:33:32.561
Coriolanus Snow is the winner
of the 10th Annual Hunger Games.

01:33:33.932 --> 01:33:36.365
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:33:36.365 --> 01:33:37.672
Congrats!

01:33:38.073 --> 01:33:38.932
Congrats!

01:33:38.932 --> 01:33:41.074
- Whoo!

01:33:41.074 --> 01:33:42.438
The Games...

01:33:42.438 --> 01:33:44.671
that I had...

01:33:44.671 --> 01:33:46.744
predicted! Whoo!

01:33:46.744 --> 01:33:48.878
Yeah! Give it up!
- Tigris.

01:33:48.878 --> 01:33:51.085
Snow! Snow! Snow!

01:33:51.085 --> 01:33:54.552

01:34:04.265 --> 01:34:05.293
<i>Lucy Gray?</i>

01:34:11.502 --> 01:34:12.806
Lucy Gray?

01:34:26.983 --> 01:34:29.982
I warned you, Mr. Snow.

01:34:29.982 --> 01:34:32.122
Cheating will be punished.

01:34:33.157 --> 01:34:35.658
More poetically than even
I could have hoped.

01:34:35.658 --> 01:34:37.264
Lucy Gray, where is she?

01:34:37.264 --> 01:34:38.631
I would be more concerned

01:34:38.631 --> 01:34:41.700
with your own survival
if I were you.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:44.967
It's fitting that
both your parents

01:34:44.967 --> 01:34:47.434
could be here
for your big moment.

01:34:48.111 --> 01:34:49.342
That compact.

01:34:49.342 --> 01:34:50.840
How many times did I see

01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.380
your mother use it,
I wonder...

01:34:53.380 --> 01:34:56.113
to powder her beautiful face?

01:34:56.712 --> 01:34:57.847
Come now,

01:34:57.847 --> 01:34:59.748
we both know
that child from 11

01:34:59.748 --> 01:35:01.948
didn't die of disease.

01:35:01.948 --> 01:35:04.291
Or that lumberjack from 7.

01:35:04.291 --> 01:35:06.223
And that old handkerchief,

01:35:06.223 --> 01:35:10.060
we found it in the snake tank,
appropriately...

01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:13.229
condemning you with
your father's own initials.

01:35:14.568 --> 01:35:15.864
Your family won't ever see

01:35:15.864 --> 01:35:19.434
that prize money
now of course.

01:35:19.434 --> 01:35:22.368
President Ravinstill has left
your form of punishment to me,

01:35:22.368 --> 01:35:24.505
and I've decided banishment
to the districts

01:35:24.505 --> 01:35:29.209
where you'll serve your Capitol
in exile for the next 20 years

01:35:29.209 --> 01:35:31.984
as an anonymous,
peacekeeping grunt.

01:35:38.052 --> 01:35:39.860
Do you hear that, boy?

01:35:42.097 --> 01:35:43.226
Finally.

01:35:44.730 --> 01:35:49.034
The sound of snow falling.

01:36:10.654 --> 01:36:11.925
8.

01:36:12.525 --> 01:36:14.422
Send me to 12.

01:36:19.827 --> 01:36:21.264
Please.

01:36:35.885 --> 01:36:37.945
You know, I thought
I might find you here

01:36:37.945 --> 01:36:39.216
sitting all by yourself.

01:36:40.016 --> 01:36:41.255
Sejanus, what are you doing...

01:36:41.255 --> 01:36:42.148
What do you think?

01:36:42.148 --> 01:36:44.484
After what I did in the arena,

01:36:44.484 --> 01:36:46.955
my father had to buy
the Academy a brand-new gym

01:36:46.955 --> 01:36:48.824
just so I could get my diploma.

01:36:48.824 --> 01:36:50.160
He begged me to stay.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:53.700
But once I found out
where they were sending you,

01:36:53.700 --> 01:36:56.299
I couldn't
get out fast enough.

01:36:56.299 --> 01:36:58.832
Barely made the train
because of this stupid knee.

01:36:58.832 --> 01:37:00.972
But it's okay.

01:37:00.972 --> 01:37:03.003
They gave me
some morphling for the pain.

01:37:03.003 --> 01:37:04.907
You volunteered for this?

01:37:04.907 --> 01:37:07.207
I figure I get through basic

01:37:07.207 --> 01:37:09.616
and then maybe
I become a medic.

01:37:09.616 --> 01:37:11.351
Make a real
difference out here.

01:37:11.351 --> 01:37:13.019
Just like you said.

01:37:14.052 --> 01:37:16.618
They never told us
what you did.

01:37:16.618 --> 01:37:17.991
I cheated.

01:37:18.925 --> 01:37:20.928
To save Lucy Gray
from the snakes.

01:37:23.532 --> 01:37:24.893
Do you think they killed her?

01:37:24.893 --> 01:37:26.729
Why would they risk it?

01:37:26.729 --> 01:37:27.996
She was a big hit.

01:37:27.996 --> 01:37:29.429
If there is a Games next year,

01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:30.967
they're probably
gonna invite her

01:37:30.967 --> 01:37:32.467
to sing at
the opening ceremony.

01:37:33.873 --> 01:37:35.137
You know,
when you came in,

01:37:35.137 --> 01:37:37.137
I was weighing
the merits of suicide.

01:37:37.137 --> 01:37:40.077
When we're about to be free?

01:37:40.077 --> 01:37:42.476
When the girl
you risked everything for

01:37:42.476 --> 01:37:45.478
might be waiting for you
at the end of this track?

01:37:45.478 --> 01:37:48.587
My friend, don't give them
the satisfaction.

01:37:48.587 --> 01:37:49.984
Your life has just begun.

01:37:49.984 --> 01:37:51.552
You're gonna do great.

01:37:54.024 --> 01:37:55.424
We're both gonna do great.

01:37:56.057 --> 01:37:57.624
Just be careful.

01:37:58.200 --> 01:37:59.230
Okay?

01:38:02.670 --> 01:38:04.466
It's a different world out here.

01:38:25.493 --> 01:38:26.521
Move it out!

01:38:31.632 --> 01:38:33.030
<i>Welcome to 12.</i>

01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:35.195
<i>We're proud
to have every one of you</i>

01:38:35.195 --> 01:38:37.702
<i>serving your country out here.</i>

01:38:37.702 --> 01:38:39.170
<i>For the next 20 years,</i>

01:38:39.170 --> 01:38:41.508
<i>brothers and sisters
in your immediate squad</i>

01:38:41.508 --> 01:38:42.702
<i>will become your family.</i>

01:38:42.702 --> 01:38:45.672
You will train together,
sleep together, eat together.

01:38:45.672 --> 01:38:49.616
You will rise together
and you will fall together.

01:38:49.616 --> 01:38:51.180
You will be our eyes and ears

01:38:51.180 --> 01:38:53.817
out here on my base
as well as off it.

01:38:53.817 --> 01:38:55.283
And it will be your duty

01:38:55.283 --> 01:38:57.491
to report anything
suspicious you see,

01:38:57.491 --> 01:38:59.023
because if you do not,

01:38:59.023 --> 01:39:02.128
you are as good
as a rebel yourself.

01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:06.666
Last month, a Peacekeeper
and two mine bosses

01:39:06.666 --> 01:39:09.361
were shot dead in the pits.

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:11.571
We retrieved the murder weapon.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.139
We swabbed it for DNA.

01:39:13.139 --> 01:39:16.541
And the results proved
beyond doubt that this man,

01:39:16.541 --> 01:39:18.540
Arlo Chance...

01:39:19.315 --> 01:39:20.481
is guilty.

01:39:20.481 --> 01:39:22.515
So, watch, all of you.

01:39:22.515 --> 01:39:24.181
This is what happens

01:39:24.181 --> 01:39:26.546
when you challenge
the Capitol's rule of law.

01:39:26.546 --> 01:39:27.953
He's innocent!
No, no, no!

01:39:27.953 --> 01:39:29.788
No, no, no!

01:39:29.788 --> 01:39:31.285
- He's innocent!
- Lil, Lil, Lil!

01:39:31.285 --> 01:39:32.623
- No, Lil!
He's innocent!

01:39:32.623 --> 01:39:34.493
Run, Lil, run!

01:39:36.256 --> 01:39:38.730
Run, Lil! Run, Lil!

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:39.995
- No, no, no!
- Arlo!

01:39:39.995 --> 01:39:42.131
- No! No!
- No, no, no!

01:39:42.131 --> 01:39:44.064
No! Arlo!
No, no, no!

01:39:44.064 --> 01:39:45.131
Run, Lil!

01:39:45.131 --> 01:39:47.670
You're murderers!

01:39:47.670 --> 01:39:49.635
No! No!

01:39:49.635 --> 01:39:52.038
Run, Lil, run!
You're murderers!

01:39:52.038 --> 01:39:55.313
Run, Lil, run!

01:39:56.511 --> 01:39:59.083
He didn't do it!

01:39:59.083 --> 01:40:01.951
You're all murderers!
Let me out!

01:40:01.951 --> 01:40:03.651
Let me out!

01:40:04.723 --> 01:40:06.491
Let me out!

01:40:06.491 --> 01:40:07.520
Arlo!

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:09.129
What were you
thinking back there?

01:40:09.129 --> 01:40:11.293
She didn't do anything, Coryo.
What is she guilty of?

01:40:11.293 --> 01:40:14.161
Being directly
associated with rebels.

01:40:14.161 --> 01:40:15.330
What more do they need?

01:40:15.330 --> 01:40:17.333
If she had gotten
through the crowd...

01:40:17.333 --> 01:40:19.799
He didn't do it!
I swear he didn't do it!

01:40:19.799 --> 01:40:22.672
...I don't think I would have
been able to shoot her.

01:40:22.672 --> 01:40:23.743
Would you?

01:40:23.743 --> 01:40:25.278
He didn't do anything!

01:40:25.278 --> 01:40:27.545
You need to find a way to make
peace with our life here now.

01:40:27.545 --> 01:40:31.749
Or have your father
buy you a discharge
and do something else.

01:40:31.749 --> 01:40:33.120
Hey.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:35.114
Hoff's given us all
leave passes for the weekend.

01:40:35.114 --> 01:40:36.354
Boost morale.

01:40:37.823 --> 01:40:39.093
Boost morale.

01:40:40.090 --> 01:40:41.590
Please.

01:40:43.124 --> 01:40:45.597
Please help.

01:41:02.412 --> 01:41:04.877
Hey, uh,
I'm gonna go get a drink.

01:41:15.926 --> 01:41:17.893
Is it hot in here?

01:41:17.893 --> 01:41:19.265
Yeah!

01:41:19.265 --> 01:41:22.568
'Cause we're plannin'
on heating it up a set more.

01:41:24.365 --> 01:41:28.134
The one, the only,
Lucy Gray Baird!

01:41:37.516 --> 01:41:39.717
Well, hey there,
District 12, did you miss me?

01:41:39.717 --> 01:41:41.285
Yeah!

01:41:41.285 --> 01:41:43.353
I bet you never expected
to lay eyes on me again.

01:41:43.353 --> 01:41:44.887
And, let me tell you,
that goes both ways.

01:41:44.887 --> 01:41:46.057
But I am back.

01:41:46.057 --> 01:41:48.289
- I sure am back!

01:41:48.289 --> 01:41:49.860
Oh! Is that bottle there for me?

01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:51.130
Oh, come on, y'all.

01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:52.961
You know, I gave up drinking
when I was 12.

01:41:55.498 --> 01:41:58.002
It's to clear my pipes, y'all.
To clear my pipes.

01:41:58.002 --> 01:41:59.605
Now, how about a song, huh?

01:41:59.605 --> 01:42:01.071
Yeah!

01:42:04.571 --> 01:42:07.742

Lucy Gray!

01:43:27.995 --> 01:43:29.593
- Lucy Gray!
- Billy Taupe!

01:43:30.628 --> 01:43:32.357
You're sounding
kind of thin, Lucy Gray.

01:43:32.357 --> 01:43:33.495
Billy! Billy!

01:43:33.495 --> 01:43:36.264
You're all sounding thin
without me. No?

01:43:36.264 --> 01:43:37.535
- Billy!
- I've got it.

01:43:38.403 --> 01:43:39.801
Billy!

01:43:40.542 --> 01:43:42.541
Billy!

01:43:42.541 --> 01:43:45.439
You swore you wouldn't play
with them again, Billy Taupe.

01:43:47.239 --> 01:43:48.310
Come on.

01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:50.113
Settle down, settle down.

01:43:55.284 --> 01:43:56.550
I know you miss me, Lucy Gray.

01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:57.957
Get your hands
off me right now.

01:43:57.957 --> 01:43:59.191
Get your hands off me, Billy.

01:43:59.191 --> 01:44:00.321
Get your hands off me,
Billy Taupe.

01:44:00.321 --> 01:44:01.457
After what you did to me,

01:44:01.457 --> 01:44:02.723
you get your hands
off me right now.

01:44:02.723 --> 01:44:04.290
Or I swear I will take a snake
and I will...

01:44:04.290 --> 01:44:05.563
Don't touch her!

01:44:08.670 --> 01:44:09.697
Coryo, stop!

01:44:09.697 --> 01:44:11.664
- Get off me, get off me!
- What are you, crazy?

01:44:11.664 --> 01:44:13.134
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

01:44:24.646 --> 01:44:26.683
Who'd have thought
I'd have to save you?

01:44:32.056 --> 01:44:33.393
She's here.

01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:35.461
She's alive.

01:45:21.308 --> 01:45:23.102
They said
I might find you out here.

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:26.941
Sorry, I...

01:45:29.844 --> 01:45:32.419
I still got
one foot in the arena.

01:45:38.353 --> 01:45:39.888
Your hair,

01:45:40.323 --> 01:45:41.620
that uniform...

01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:43.391
I thought you were dead.

01:45:43.391 --> 01:45:45.124
Yeah, I thought I was too.

01:45:46.963 --> 01:45:51.130
But your dean, Highbottom,
he had them send me home.

01:45:51.873 --> 01:45:53.065
Highbottom did?

01:45:53.065 --> 01:45:55.503
Put me on a train himself,
gave me some money.

01:45:55.503 --> 01:45:57.405
He said they'd sent you to 8.

01:45:57.405 --> 01:45:58.973
For breaking their rules.

01:46:00.244 --> 01:46:01.448
Saving your life.

01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:03.445
But I gave them my last cent

01:46:03.445 --> 01:46:05.144
so that I could come here to 12.

01:46:06.781 --> 01:46:08.821
Because I had to
try to find you.

01:46:08.821 --> 01:46:10.754
Your dean, he...

01:46:11.721 --> 01:46:13.823
he told me
the strangest thing. He...

01:46:16.892 --> 01:46:19.928
He said he was glad
that I survived you.

01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:23.635
He told you what I did
to that boy in the arena?

01:46:28.009 --> 01:46:29.769
I didn't have a choice.

01:46:29.769 --> 01:46:31.739
- That little girl, Dill...
- I know.

01:46:31.739 --> 01:46:33.210
I thought it'd be
one of the others...

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:35.279
- maybe Coral...
- Hey.

01:46:35.279 --> 01:46:36.980
You are not a killer, Lucy Gray.

01:46:36.980 --> 01:46:38.144
Yes, I am.

01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:42.720
Both of us are now.

01:46:44.826 --> 01:46:45.822
You're safe.

01:47:06.609 --> 01:47:08.207
Your Peacekeeper friends.

01:47:08.983 --> 01:47:10.009
I'll handle this.

01:47:10.009 --> 01:47:11.980
They'll be here
about the fight last night.

01:47:14.122 --> 01:47:15.885
Hey, they can't see us together.

01:47:17.455 --> 01:47:19.218
There's a lake out in the woods.

01:47:21.429 --> 01:47:23.794
Nobody knows
much of it except us Covey.

01:47:25.399 --> 01:47:26.764
Meet me here tomorrow,
we'll go.

01:47:27.432 --> 01:47:29.795
We can be free out there.

01:47:29.795 --> 01:47:31.466
Maude Ivory, you got my guitar?

01:47:31.466 --> 01:47:33.067
- Yeah.
- Thanks, honey.

01:47:40.414 --> 01:47:41.544
I can put something together.

01:47:41.544 --> 01:47:43.609
All right.
Yeah.

01:47:43.609 --> 01:47:45.112
Your boy is coming.

01:47:45.514 --> 01:47:46.751
See you later.

01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:50.282
Hey, you're back.

01:47:51.223 --> 01:47:53.286
How's Lucy Gray?

01:47:53.286 --> 01:47:57.796
Figured you'd be a while,
so I decided to explore town.

01:47:57.796 --> 01:47:59.229
Oh.

01:47:59.229 --> 01:48:00.926
With Billy Taupe?

01:48:00.926 --> 01:48:02.994
And who's the other guy
with him?

01:48:02.994 --> 01:48:05.303
I remember that
from the Academy.

01:48:05.303 --> 01:48:07.002
Watching you watch everyone.

01:48:07.936 --> 01:48:10.035
Carefully choosing
when to weigh in.

01:48:10.035 --> 01:48:11.474
Are you trying
to help these people?

01:48:11.474 --> 01:48:13.509
Don't you think they need help?

01:48:13.509 --> 01:48:15.009
They lost the war, Sejanus.

01:48:15.009 --> 01:48:18.948
A war they started
that made your family rich.

01:48:19.847 --> 01:48:21.619
I am not about to throw away

01:48:21.619 --> 01:48:23.884
any chance I might have
of getting home someday

01:48:23.884 --> 01:48:25.856
just because
you feel a bit guilty.

01:48:27.556 --> 01:48:29.493

Mockingjays, we call 'em.

01:49:57.250 --> 01:49:58.850
Does she survive?

01:49:59.982 --> 01:50:03.320
Lucy Gray, in the song?
The footprints?

01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:05.050
Maybe she flew away.

01:50:05.050 --> 01:50:07.390
I'm sure
she's out there somewhere.

01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:09.020
She's a survivor.

01:50:09.020 --> 01:50:11.225
But it's a mystery, sweetheart.

01:50:12.133 --> 01:50:13.230
Just like me.

01:50:14.596 --> 01:50:16.065
I brought you something.

01:50:22.507 --> 01:50:24.007
It was my mother's.

01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:27.208
I'd like for you to have it.

01:50:29.249 --> 01:50:30.717
Mmm.

01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:33.786
It still smells like roses.

01:50:35.551 --> 01:50:36.756
Thank you.

01:50:37.624 --> 01:50:40.120
I'll take good care of it,
I promise.

01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:42.861
You must miss your family
so much out here.

01:50:43.657 --> 01:50:44.896
I do.

01:50:45.795 --> 01:50:46.927
I worry about them all the time.

01:50:46.927 --> 01:50:49.164
Would you
really go back, though?

01:50:50.237 --> 01:50:52.104
If you could?

01:50:52.104 --> 01:50:53.236
To the Capitol?

01:50:53.236 --> 01:50:54.503
I have to.

01:50:54.503 --> 01:50:55.940
It's where I belong.

01:50:57.171 --> 01:50:59.674
But I hope
you'll come back with me.

01:50:59.674 --> 01:51:01.645
Capitol's not for me.

01:51:01.645 --> 01:51:04.845
At least it's civilized.
Has order.

01:51:04.845 --> 01:51:06.918
The Hunger Games are order?

01:51:07.681 --> 01:51:09.122
No.

01:51:09.122 --> 01:51:10.383
No, of course not.

01:51:11.725 --> 01:51:14.587
What if this
was our life, Coriolanus?

01:51:14.587 --> 01:51:15.927
Out here.

01:51:17.463 --> 01:51:19.731
Waking up whenever.

01:51:19.731 --> 01:51:22.100
Catching our own food,
living out by a lake.

01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:25.400
I mean, would
you still feel a need
for the Capitol even then?

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:26.498
Uh...

01:51:28.136 --> 01:51:30.636
- Did you two just pick this?
- Yep.

01:51:30.636 --> 01:51:31.910
Thank you.

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.849
Well, it's a little early yet,
Maude Ivory.

01:51:37.616 --> 01:51:39.514
No.
-  No.

01:51:39.514 --> 01:51:40.853
Early for what?

01:51:41.651 --> 01:51:43.086
To eat the roots.

01:51:44.186 --> 01:51:47.120
Pretty little thing,
but it's determined.

01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:49.093
Some people call it
"swamp potato."

01:51:49.093 --> 01:51:52.898
But I think "katniss" has
a much nicer ring, don't you?

01:51:57.272 --> 01:51:59.132
Hey, grab the rods, CC?

01:51:59.132 --> 01:52:00.999
We could use
some more fish at home.

01:52:05.544 --> 01:52:07.143
He misses Billy Taupe.

01:52:09.083 --> 01:52:10.146
Do you?

01:52:12.552 --> 01:52:14.414
Not since the Reaping, no.

01:52:16.622 --> 01:52:18.484
I can't trust him anymore.

01:52:19.492 --> 01:52:21.091
Trust is everything.

01:52:22.396 --> 01:52:23.995
It's everything to me.

01:52:26.093 --> 01:52:27.900
More important even than love.

01:52:29.067 --> 01:52:31.431
Without trust, you might
as well be dead to me.

01:52:32.806 --> 01:52:34.805
You can trust me.
I promise you that.

01:52:34.805 --> 01:52:36.737
If you can trust
anyone in this world,

01:52:36.737 --> 01:52:38.042
you can trust me.

01:52:41.679 --> 01:52:43.212
You can trust me too.

01:52:48.553 --> 01:52:49.548
Private Snow?

01:52:50.489 --> 01:52:51.484
Come with us.

01:53:03.170 --> 01:53:04.634
Snow.

01:53:04.634 --> 01:53:05.968
I received the results

01:53:05.968 --> 01:53:08.366
from your aptitude tests
this morning.

01:53:08.366 --> 01:53:10.509
Looked over your
training records too.

01:53:10.509 --> 01:53:12.206
Your performance is exemplary.

01:53:12.206 --> 01:53:14.407
Well, half the other recruits
can't read, sir.

01:53:14.407 --> 01:53:18.852
You're General
Crassus Snow's boy.

01:53:20.213 --> 01:53:22.652
What did you do to end up here?

01:53:22.652 --> 01:53:24.652
I made an enemy, sir.

01:53:24.652 --> 01:53:26.057
In the Capitol.

01:53:26.057 --> 01:53:29.923
I've made a career out of
ruining my enemies' plans.

01:53:29.923 --> 01:53:31.631
I'm gonna reassign you

01:53:31.631 --> 01:53:33.498
to officer training
in District 2.

01:53:33.498 --> 01:53:35.429
You'll earn a real wage.

01:53:35.429 --> 01:53:38.371
Maybe even have another shot
at the Capitol one day.

01:53:38.371 --> 01:53:40.636
Train leaves in 10 days.

01:53:40.636 --> 01:53:42.533
Keep a clean record,

01:53:42.533 --> 01:53:46.110
you'll never see anyone
from District 12 again.

01:53:49.450 --> 01:53:51.443
Is there a problem?

01:53:51.443 --> 01:53:54.382
This is an honor, Private.
Not an option.

01:53:54.915 --> 01:53:56.120
Yes, sir.

01:53:57.258 --> 01:53:58.254
Thank you.

01:54:00.789 --> 01:54:02.929
<i>Coryo?</i>
- Tigris?

01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:05.693
<i>Coryo!</i>

01:54:05.693 --> 01:54:08.198
Tigris.

01:54:08.732 --> 01:54:09.930
<i>Your curls!</i>

01:54:09.930 --> 01:54:12.235
Yeah, I know.

01:54:13.737 --> 01:54:14.941
Where are you?

01:54:15.509 --> 01:54:16.541
<i>Coryo, we're fine.</i>

01:54:16.541 --> 01:54:18.340
Tigris, where are you?

01:54:21.878 --> 01:54:24.114
<i>We had to move out.</i>

01:54:24.114 --> 01:54:26.649
<i>We're renting this place
just for right now.</i>

01:54:26.649 --> 01:54:27.815
They evicted you?

01:54:27.815 --> 01:54:30.423
<i>Listen. I'm fine.</i>

01:54:30.423 --> 01:54:31.450
<i>Grandma'am is fine.</i>

01:54:31.450 --> 01:54:34.891
<i>I really don't
want you to worry, okay?</i>

01:54:34.891 --> 01:54:37.491
I think I found
a way out of here.

01:54:37.491 --> 01:54:40.163
I just have to make it
through Officer Training in 2.

01:54:40.163 --> 01:54:43.096
And then I can make my way
back to the Capitol.

01:54:43.096 --> 01:54:45.169
- I will fix this.
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:54:45.935 --> 01:54:47.239
I'm gonna be home soon.

01:54:47.239 --> 01:54:48.871
I promise.

01:54:48.871 --> 01:54:50.572
<i>Don't make me hope.</i>

01:55:14.667 --> 01:55:16.095
Secure! Good to go!

01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:37.853
Whatever it is you're doing,
you need to stop it.

01:55:37.853 --> 01:55:39.122
- What are you...
- Don't.

01:55:39.122 --> 01:55:41.990
I saw you talking
to that woman in the jail.

01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:43.323
If I don't report you now...

01:55:43.323 --> 01:55:45.027
You don't know
anything to report.

01:55:45.027 --> 01:55:47.425
They know
we're friends, Sejanus.

01:55:47.425 --> 01:55:49.131
You're gonna
get us both killed.

01:55:49.131 --> 01:55:51.001
You told me
I could do something.

01:55:51.001 --> 01:55:53.732
You told me
I could make a difference.

01:55:55.635 --> 01:55:57.703
There's a group of locals
that are getting

01:55:57.703 --> 01:55:59.438
- out of District 12 for good.
- Don't. Stop talking.

01:55:59.438 --> 01:56:01.410
- I can't hear this.
- Listen to me.

01:56:06.653 --> 01:56:08.316
They're going up north

01:56:08.316 --> 01:56:11.189
to start a new life
far away from Panem.

01:56:12.121 --> 01:56:13.354
They need money for supplies.

01:56:13.354 --> 01:56:15.627
They told me I could go
if I got it for them.

01:56:15.627 --> 01:56:16.796
You could come with us.

01:56:16.796 --> 01:56:18.723
You're giving money
to the locals.

01:56:18.723 --> 01:56:21.095
Are you out of your mind?
They're all rebels.

01:56:21.095 --> 01:56:22.762
I can't stay here. I won't.

01:56:22.762 --> 01:56:25.031
They're not planning on doing
anything dangerous, okay?

01:56:25.031 --> 01:56:26.666
It's all dangerous.

01:56:26.666 --> 01:56:29.636
They're just doing what
anybody else would do, Coryo.

01:56:29.636 --> 01:56:32.478
The leader, Spruce, he wants
to get his sister, Lil,

01:56:32.478 --> 01:56:33.613
out of jail on base.

01:56:33.613 --> 01:56:34.739
Hoff is going to execute her

01:56:34.739 --> 01:56:37.075
just because she knows the man
that they killed.

01:56:37.075 --> 01:56:38.310
It's wrong.

01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:39.744
I'm gonna help them get her out.

01:56:39.744 --> 01:56:42.088
- It's treason, Sejanus.
- Nobody's gonna get hurt.

01:56:42.088 --> 01:56:44.724
I'm just doing what you
told me to do at the arena.

01:56:44.724 --> 01:56:46.156
I was just trying
to save you

01:56:46.156 --> 01:56:48.559
the first time you did
something stupid enough

01:56:48.559 --> 01:56:50.063
to ruin my life.

01:56:51.330 --> 01:56:53.933
What if they catch you
bringing this woman off base?

01:56:53.933 --> 01:56:55.928
It's worth the risk
to do the right thing.

01:56:55.928 --> 01:56:57.200
For you.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.834
Your father will just
buy your way out of it

01:56:58.834 --> 01:57:00.236
like he always does,

01:57:00.236 --> 01:57:03.142
while I'll be hung
just for knowing you.

01:57:04.543 --> 01:57:05.540
Please.

01:57:06.373 --> 01:57:08.881
Don't make me rescue you again.

01:57:08.881 --> 01:57:11.216
I don't need you
to rescue me, Coryo.

01:57:31.497 --> 01:57:33.037
<i>They're just doing</i>

01:57:33.037 --> 01:57:34.838

You said that money
was for supplies to get north.

01:59:42.262 --> 01:59:43.365
These are supplies.

01:59:43.365 --> 01:59:44.698
What, did you think
this was a game?

01:59:44.698 --> 01:59:46.138
You said that
nobody was gonna get hurt.

01:59:46.138 --> 01:59:47.232
- That isn't part of the deal.
Hey.

01:59:48.299 --> 01:59:49.572
Hey, stop!

01:59:50.539 --> 01:59:52.303
What are you doing?
Guns, Sejanus?

01:59:52.303 --> 01:59:55.045
I didn't know there
was gonna be weapons,
Coryo. They lied to me.

01:59:55.045 --> 01:59:56.612
You thought they'd be honest?

01:59:56.612 --> 01:59:58.512
Are you crazy? There are
Peacekeepers right out there.

01:59:58.512 --> 02:00:00.619
There's another one
in here now, too.

02:00:00.619 --> 02:00:02.183
Okay, wait.

02:00:02.183 --> 02:00:03.319
And the mayor's daughter?

02:00:03.319 --> 02:00:05.190
Hey, it's okay, Spruce.
He's with me.

02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:07.124
I told him to come in here.
He's gonna help.

02:00:07.124 --> 02:00:08.554
- Hey, where'd...
- Wait, wait, wait.

02:00:08.554 --> 02:00:10.729
You invite
the whole town, Plinth?

02:00:10.729 --> 02:00:11.789
She's okay, Spruce.

02:00:11.789 --> 02:00:13.565
She's joining us too.
She's with me.

02:00:13.565 --> 02:00:14.628
She what?

02:00:14.628 --> 02:00:16.697
Quiet down, Mayfair.
I'll explain later.

02:00:16.697 --> 02:00:19.937
I think I'm done listening
to your explanations.

02:00:19.937 --> 02:00:22.004
She's not going anywhere.

02:00:22.004 --> 02:00:23.438
And neither are you.

02:00:23.438 --> 02:00:25.743
My pa's gonna string
y'all up for this.

02:00:25.743 --> 02:00:26.604
Stop!

02:00:26.604 --> 02:00:27.739
She'll tell everyone, you idiot.

02:00:27.739 --> 02:00:29.281
- She'll get us all hung.
- He's right.

02:00:29.281 --> 02:00:31.345
No, she won't, Spruce.
She's all talk, no action.

02:00:31.345 --> 02:00:33.385
What do you think, Lucy Gray?

02:00:34.086 --> 02:00:35.715
Am I all talk, no action?

02:00:35.715 --> 02:00:39.017
Hey, how'd you enjoy
the Capitol, by the way?

02:00:40.293 --> 02:00:41.959
See y'all
at the Hanging Tree.

02:00:41.959 --> 02:00:42.988
- No, no!

02:00:44.258 --> 02:00:45.696
Wait.

02:00:48.160 --> 02:00:49.799
Mayfair!

<i>♪ Keep on

02:00:55.072 --> 02:00:57.243
Coriolanus, what
did you just do?

02:00:57.243 --> 02:00:59.142
Well, you just shot
the mayor's daughter, son.

02:00:59.142 --> 02:01:00.377
What did you just do?

02:01:00.377 --> 02:01:02.345
If you weren't a rebel before,
you are now.

02:01:02.345 --> 02:01:04.244
- You killed her.
- Quiet, Billy Taupe.

02:01:04.244 --> 02:01:05.414
You're all right.

02:01:05.414 --> 02:01:06.645
You and me,
we're gonna be all right.

02:01:06.645 --> 02:01:08.013
No one is gonna
think this was us.

02:01:08.013 --> 02:01:10.015
You reckon you're just gonna
walk out of here free?

02:01:11.324 --> 02:01:13.488
- Dump this on me, maybe?
- I said, pipe down.

02:01:13.488 --> 02:01:16.460
You got a surprise
coming, Capitol boy.

02:01:16.460 --> 02:01:19.225
If I'm gonna swing for this,
you swing with me.

02:01:21.931 --> 02:01:23.929
Oh!

02:01:23.929 --> 02:01:26.403
- I didn't trust him anyway.
- Billy Taupe!

02:01:26.403 --> 02:01:28.871
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

02:01:28.871 --> 02:01:31.342
You're gonna go
back out on that stage
and you're gonna sing.

02:01:31.342 --> 02:01:32.937
You're gonna sing
like nothing is wrong.

02:01:32.937 --> 02:01:34.410
And I'm gonna find us
a way out of this, okay?

02:01:34.410 --> 02:01:36.912
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay? I swear. I swear.

02:01:36.912 --> 02:01:38.043
Go. Go.

02:01:39.118 --> 02:01:41.687
Get rid of these guns. Go.

02:01:41.687 --> 02:01:42.949
Go, Spruce, go.

02:01:42.949 --> 02:01:44.286
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

02:01:44.286 --> 02:01:45.554
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

02:01:45.554 --> 02:01:47.420
- For once, shut up.
- It's all my fault!

02:01:47.420 --> 02:01:49.023
All of this is your fault.

02:01:49.023 --> 02:01:51.727
It's only gonna get
worse if you don't
pull yourself together.

02:01:51.727 --> 02:01:54.196
If you breathe a word now,
both of us, we're finished.

02:01:54.196 --> 02:01:55.595
So we go back out there

02:01:55.595 --> 02:01:58.169
and we act like
nothing is wrong.

02:01:58.169 --> 02:01:59.702
-  I don't know...
- Hey.

02:02:01.039 --> 02:02:02.675
Hey, look at me.

02:02:02.675 --> 02:02:05.505
You have to
pull yourself together.
You have to pull it together.

02:02:05.505 --> 02:02:07.413
You came here for me, right?

02:02:08.343 --> 02:02:09.613
We're brothers?

02:02:10.212 --> 02:02:11.582
Brothers.

02:02:11.582 --> 02:02:16.247
So whatever you've done,
I swear I will keep you safe.

02:02:16.247 --> 02:02:19.386
Those guns were
the only loose end
besides the four of us.

02:02:19.386 --> 02:02:20.822
So we're gonna be okay.

02:02:21.521 --> 02:02:23.521
Okay? Not a word.

02:02:23.521 --> 02:02:24.624
- Okay.
- Okay?

02:02:30.831 --> 02:02:32.470
Hey, Beanie.
Yeah?

02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:34.635
Who's that girl
you were dancing with, man?

02:02:34.635 --> 02:02:36.439
I think her name was Josie.

02:02:36.439 --> 02:02:39.310
Come on, everybody, up!
Everybody up!

02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:41.942
- Let's go!
- Smiley, what's going on?

02:02:43.181 --> 02:02:44.714
Hoff is losing his mind.

02:02:44.714 --> 02:02:46.614
The mayor's daughter got shot,
and her boyfriend, too.

02:02:46.614 --> 02:02:48.581
He's sending out
every grunt we've got,

02:02:48.581 --> 02:02:50.148
to find the guns that did it.

02:02:55.088 --> 02:02:58.925
It is our duty to keep peace
in this district.

02:02:58.925 --> 02:03:01.827
So these murderers
shall be brought to justice.

02:03:01.827 --> 02:03:04.094
We shall find
their murder weapons.

02:03:04.094 --> 02:03:07.306
<i>If the killers are still
in Panem's grasp,</i>

02:03:07.306 --> 02:03:09.937
<i>they will hang
before the week is out.</i>

02:03:11.204 --> 02:03:13.145
Right there.
Don't move, all right?

02:03:13.145 --> 02:03:14.375
Check the other one.

02:03:14.375 --> 02:03:15.475
I didn't do anything!

02:03:15.475 --> 02:03:17.412
- Go!

02:03:17.412 --> 02:03:18.479
Backs to the wall!

02:03:18.479 --> 02:03:19.947
These are children, please!

02:03:21.748 --> 02:03:23.181
Clear!
- Clear!

02:03:32.966 --> 02:03:34.059
Are you okay?

02:03:34.059 --> 02:03:36.332
The mayor's going
to get me killed, Coriolanus.

02:03:36.332 --> 02:03:37.663
He already thinks it was me.

02:03:37.663 --> 02:03:39.471
Billy Taupe, Mayfair, both dead.

02:03:39.471 --> 02:03:41.637
If they catch Spruce now,
or Sejanus talks...

02:03:41.637 --> 02:03:44.738
- Sejanus won't talk.
- How do you know that?

02:03:44.738 --> 02:03:46.176
They torture
the people they catch

02:03:46.176 --> 02:03:47.242
for information here.

02:03:47.242 --> 02:03:48.813
Even Peacekeepers.

02:03:48.813 --> 02:03:49.944
I'm sorry.

02:03:50.511 --> 02:03:51.713
I'm so sorry.

02:03:51.713 --> 02:03:53.552
I should have dealt
with those guns myself.

02:03:54.086 --> 02:03:56.287
And Mayfair...

02:03:56.287 --> 02:03:57.385
I just wasn't
thinking straight.

02:03:57.385 --> 02:03:59.358
I have to run. North.

02:03:59.358 --> 02:04:01.323
Like Billy Taupe
and the others talked about.

02:04:01.323 --> 02:04:02.758
Away from the districts.

02:04:02.758 --> 02:04:04.359
If I stay here now,
I'm as good as dead, too.

02:04:04.359 --> 02:04:05.691
What about the Covey?

02:04:05.691 --> 02:04:07.599
They can look after each other.

02:04:08.729 --> 02:04:10.731
I just wanted to say goodbye.

02:04:15.339 --> 02:04:17.142
I'll come with you.

02:04:17.142 --> 02:04:19.140
- What about your family?
- Look.

02:04:19.140 --> 02:04:22.042
I just learned Hoff
is sending me to 2
for Officer Training

02:04:22.042 --> 02:04:24.179
- but none of that matters now.
- You were gonna leave.

02:04:24.179 --> 02:04:26.451
It's all Panem.

02:04:26.451 --> 02:04:29.385
As soon as they find that gun,
they'll hang me.

02:04:29.385 --> 02:04:31.084
No matter which district I'm in.

02:04:32.289 --> 02:04:33.559
When can you go?

02:04:36.589 --> 02:04:38.062
Tomorrow.

02:04:38.062 --> 02:04:39.257
- Dawn.
- Okay.

02:04:40.801 --> 02:04:41.798
Okay.

02:04:43.701 --> 02:04:46.968
Meet me at the Hanging Tree.
First light.

02:04:55.608 --> 02:04:56.677
Whoo-hoo!

02:04:56.677 --> 02:04:59.013
We got one.
I think we got one.

02:05:01.112 --> 02:05:03.248
- They say his name is Spruce.

02:05:08.093 --> 02:05:09.691
<i>Three years...</i>

02:05:09.691 --> 02:05:12.997
I fought for the Capitol
during the war.

02:05:12.997 --> 02:05:14.994
I've been angry.

02:05:14.994 --> 02:05:18.664
But this is the first time
I've felt ashamed.

02:05:18.664 --> 02:05:20.738
Get the other one up here.

02:05:35.055 --> 02:05:36.116
Coryo.

02:05:37.222 --> 02:05:38.349
Coryo. Coryo.

02:05:38.349 --> 02:05:40.792
The Capitol has
received word via jabberjay

02:05:40.792 --> 02:05:44.160
that these two men conspired
to break into our base's jail

02:05:44.160 --> 02:05:45.959
and flee north

02:05:45.959 --> 02:05:49.393
to release this terrorist
from captivity.

02:05:49.393 --> 02:05:53.635
I'd expect this of a rebel
but not from one of our own.

02:05:53.635 --> 02:05:56.536
This is treason,
plain and simple.

02:05:56.536 --> 02:05:58.169
Play the recording!

02:05:58.169 --> 02:05:59.575
<i>The leader, Spruce,</i>

02:05:59.575 --> 02:06:01.009

02:06:01.009 --> 02:06:02.609

02:06:02.609 --> 02:06:03.745

Are you

02:08:20.311 --> 02:08:22.755
I just wish there was more
I could've done.

02:08:26.286 --> 02:08:28.387
I'm sorry
you have to leave this place.

02:08:29.594 --> 02:08:31.728
Yeah, I'll miss the Covey.

02:08:31.728 --> 02:08:33.865
Hope they'll follow me
someday, though.

02:08:36.029 --> 02:08:37.803
You know what I won't miss?

02:08:38.665 --> 02:08:39.871
People.

02:08:40.472 --> 02:08:41.939
People aren't so bad.

02:08:42.703 --> 02:08:44.840
Not really.

02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:46.812
It's what the world
does to them.

02:08:47.645 --> 02:08:49.474
Like all of us in the arena.

02:08:51.849 --> 02:08:53.880
I think
there's a natural goodness

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:55.417
- born into us all.

02:08:55.417 --> 02:08:57.018
No, really.

02:08:57.018 --> 02:09:01.024
You can either cross that
line into evil...

02:09:01.688 --> 02:09:03.361
or not.

02:09:03.361 --> 02:09:04.355
And it's our life's work

02:09:04.355 --> 02:09:06.260
to stay on the right side
of that line.

02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:09.760
- It's not always that simple.
- Mmm.

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:11.001
I know.

02:09:11.733 --> 02:09:13.069
I'm a victor.

02:09:14.138 --> 02:09:15.835
Sure will be nice not to have
to kill anyone else

02:09:15.835 --> 02:09:17.507
up north, though, huh?

02:09:17.507 --> 02:09:18.976
Three's enough for me.

02:09:20.073 --> 02:09:21.445
I'm gonna make a walking stick.

02:09:21.445 --> 02:09:23.545
You want one?

02:09:23.545 --> 02:09:24.916
You killed three?

02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:28.546
Who's the third?

02:09:29.089 --> 02:09:29.916
What?

02:09:29.916 --> 02:09:31.249
Person you killed, Coriolanus.

02:09:31.249 --> 02:09:32.658
You said you killed
three people.

02:09:32.658 --> 02:09:34.387
I only know about two.
Do not lie to me.

02:09:36.294 --> 02:09:38.288
- Can you help me get this out?
- There was Bobbin in the arena

02:09:38.288 --> 02:09:40.998
and Mayfair.
And who's the third?

02:09:45.205 --> 02:09:46.300
My old self.

02:09:48.269 --> 02:09:51.074
I killed him
so I could come with you.

02:09:54.706 --> 02:09:55.947
Come on.

02:10:02.789 --> 02:10:04.286
Why don't we
stop here at the cabin?

02:10:04.286 --> 02:10:07.055
- Wait out the storm?
We should
really keep going.

02:10:07.055 --> 02:10:08.991
We're gonna
need food, Lucy Gray.

02:10:08.991 --> 02:10:10.489
Let's catch some fish
while we're here.

02:10:21.507 --> 02:10:22.366
If you want to fish,

02:10:22.366 --> 02:10:24.503
there's rods
under the floorboards.

02:10:33.746 --> 02:10:34.846
These ones?

02:10:34.846 --> 02:10:36.086
Uh-huh.

02:11:29.408 --> 02:11:30.404
What is it?

02:11:42.980 --> 02:11:44.554
It's the gun.

02:11:45.656 --> 02:11:48.020
The one you fired at Mayfair.

02:11:48.020 --> 02:11:52.360
Spruce must have known
about this place. If we
destroy that gun, you're free.

02:11:53.896 --> 02:11:55.264
You can go back home.

02:11:55.995 --> 02:11:57.332
Will you?

02:12:01.068 --> 02:12:02.337
No more loose ends.

02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:05.538
Besides me.

02:12:08.579 --> 02:12:09.674
Besides you?

02:12:13.213 --> 02:12:14.613
You wouldn't tell anyone.

02:12:16.851 --> 02:12:18.188
'Course not.

02:12:25.162 --> 02:12:27.128
I'm just gonna go
dig up some katniss.

02:12:27.128 --> 02:12:29.427
There's a good patch
down by the lake.

02:12:29.427 --> 02:12:31.033
I thought it was
too early for that.

02:12:31.033 --> 02:12:33.368
Well, the world
changes awful fast.

02:12:34.308 --> 02:12:35.337
Lucy Gray.

02:12:39.205 --> 02:12:41.277
It's still raining.

02:12:43.443 --> 02:12:45.479
Well, I'm not
made out of sugar.

02:13:18.748 --> 02:13:19.810
Lucy Gray?

02:13:22.356 --> 02:13:23.484
Lucy Gray?

02:13:29.696 --> 02:13:31.492
Lucy Gray, where are you?

02:13:33.531 --> 02:13:34.561
Hello?

02:13:38.969 --> 02:13:40.001
Hey, did something happen?

02:13:40.001 --> 02:13:41.133
Because if something's happened,

02:13:41.133 --> 02:13:42.437
we can talk about it.

02:13:45.304 --> 02:13:47.112
Are you hiding from me?

02:13:51.582 --> 02:13:52.744
Lucy...

02:14:07.565 --> 02:14:08.562
Ow!

02:14:18.039 --> 02:14:20.106

02:14:26.884 --> 02:14:29.682

02:19:46.732 --> 02:19:48.938
The medic said
you took quite a bite.

02:19:48.938 --> 02:19:53.872

You've passed all my tests.

02:20:12.657 --> 02:20:14.791
I've asked President Ravinstill

02:20:14.791 --> 02:20:17.001
to grant you a full pardon,

02:20:17.001 --> 02:20:18.798
effective immediately.

02:20:18.798 --> 02:20:22.105
I also told him
that you are too promising

02:20:22.105 --> 02:20:23.604
to waste in the military.

02:20:23.604 --> 02:20:25.768
So you'll be studying
under me now

02:20:25.768 --> 02:20:28.309
at the Capitol University.

02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:29.842
I can't afford University.

02:20:29.842 --> 02:20:32.644
A certain Mr. Strabo Plinth
has offered

02:20:32.644 --> 02:20:34.347
to pay for everything you need

02:20:34.347 --> 02:20:36.186
while you're there.

02:20:36.186 --> 02:20:38.856
All for being such a good friend

02:20:38.856 --> 02:20:40.185
to his Sejanus.

02:20:40.185 --> 02:20:44.329
He doesn't know quite how good
a friend you were, of course.

02:20:44.329 --> 02:20:47.730
I never mentioned
your little recording.

02:20:48.429 --> 02:20:49.928
Quite impressive,

02:20:49.928 --> 02:20:53.433
how you sent your
only friend to the noose

02:20:53.433 --> 02:20:55.273
just to get my attention.

02:20:55.273 --> 02:20:57.609
- That's not what I did.
- Are you sure?

02:20:57.609 --> 02:21:00.941
Because I think that won you
the Plinth Prize, after all.

02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:06.848
The President has agreed
to another year of the Games.

02:21:07.613 --> 02:21:09.385
People watched.

02:21:09.385 --> 02:21:11.523
And I have you
to thank for that.

02:21:13.788 --> 02:21:16.287
But before
I take you under my wing,

02:21:16.287 --> 02:21:20.593
after everything you've seen
out there in the real world,

02:21:20.593 --> 02:21:24.267
let me ask you one final time.

02:21:24.267 --> 02:21:26.769
What are the Hunger Games for?

02:21:31.102 --> 02:21:33.475
I used to think
that the Hunger Games

02:21:33.475 --> 02:21:35.778
were punishment
for the districts.

02:21:37.911 --> 02:21:39.842
Then I thought
they served as a warning

02:21:39.842 --> 02:21:42.320
to us here in the Capitol

02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:44.655
about the threat
the districts posed.

02:21:47.754 --> 02:21:50.694
Now I know
the whole world is an arena.

02:21:51.890 --> 02:21:53.994
And we need the Hunger Games.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:56.095
Every year.

02:21:57.832 --> 02:22:02.636
To remind us all
who we truly are.

02:22:02.636 --> 02:22:05.335
And who are you,
do you determine?

02:22:07.912 --> 02:22:09.740
The victor.

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:12.683
Welcome home, Mr. Snow.

02:22:41.344 --> 02:22:42.707
Oh!

02:22:42.707 --> 02:22:46.013
You look so handsome.

02:22:48.648 --> 02:22:49.918
What do you think?

02:22:51.757 --> 02:22:56.221
I think you look just like
your father, Coriolanus.

02:23:14.611 --> 02:23:16.344
Sejanus Plinth's
personal effects

02:23:16.344 --> 02:23:17.407
from District 12.

02:23:25.153 --> 02:23:27.650
I was going to return this
to his parents tonight.

02:23:27.650 --> 02:23:28.789
As a gift.

02:23:28.789 --> 02:23:31.259
It would have been
his 19th birthday.

02:23:31.259 --> 02:23:32.290
But I think...

02:23:34.762 --> 02:23:36.360
they would prefer just this.

02:23:39.237 --> 02:23:40.804
Best friends.

02:23:41.870 --> 02:23:43.636
You grew a heart
in the districts.

02:23:43.636 --> 02:23:45.105
No, not in the districts.

02:23:45.805 --> 02:23:47.437
In the Hunger Games.

02:23:48.644 --> 02:23:50.314
I should be thanking you.

02:23:50.314 --> 02:23:52.215
The credit for the Hunger Games

02:23:52.215 --> 02:23:54.383
goes to your father.

02:23:54.383 --> 02:23:56.015
Half of it, at least.

02:23:56.015 --> 02:23:59.253
I only dreamt them up
as an assignment.

02:23:59.253 --> 02:24:00.791
A joke.

02:24:01.291 --> 02:24:03.221
I was drunk.

02:24:03.221 --> 02:24:06.995
Devise a punishment
for our enemies so extreme,

02:24:06.995 --> 02:24:10.801
they will never forget
how badly they've wronged us.

02:24:14.167 --> 02:24:16.406
When I sobered up,
I wanted to destroy it.

02:24:16.406 --> 02:24:20.211
But your father, my best friend,

02:24:20.211 --> 02:24:21.977
he'd stolen it from me.

02:24:22.975 --> 02:24:24.174
Put both our names on it,

02:24:24.174 --> 02:24:27.180
taken it to Gaul
to rise up himself.

02:24:31.323 --> 02:24:33.054
I tried morphling...

02:24:34.723 --> 02:24:37.091
the night that first child fell.

02:24:39.563 --> 02:24:42.129
I hoped the Games might die out.

02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:46.298
I tried to stop them
however I could.

02:24:49.308 --> 02:24:51.169
But then you came along.

02:24:51.169 --> 02:24:53.804
Now the blood
of so many more generations

02:24:53.804 --> 02:24:55.809
will be on my hands.

02:24:55.809 --> 02:24:57.340
Because you've
shown us the price

02:24:57.340 --> 02:25:00.378
people are willing to pay
for a good show.

02:25:03.089 --> 02:25:04.151
Tell me...

02:25:05.721 --> 02:25:08.122
was she sad when you left 12?

02:25:09.328 --> 02:25:11.257
Your little songbird?

02:25:12.057 --> 02:25:14.357
I expect it made us both sad.

02:25:14.357 --> 02:25:18.065
My contacts inform me
that she's disappeared.

02:25:18.065 --> 02:25:20.502
That the mayor might have
killed her out there.

02:25:20.502 --> 02:25:22.669
But there's no proof.

02:25:22.669 --> 02:25:24.708
It's a mystery.

02:25:24.708 --> 02:25:28.538
And mysteries have a way
of driving people mad.

02:25:30.708 --> 02:25:32.915
Look at you.

02:25:32.915 --> 02:25:36.150
Heir to the Plinth fortune,
nothing in your way.

02:25:37.718 --> 02:25:39.516
Snow lands on top.

02:25:41.126 --> 02:25:42.123
Yeah.
