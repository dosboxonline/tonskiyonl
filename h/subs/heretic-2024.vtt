the Book of Mormon is fake,

was moaning loudly,

in that kind of video.

01:37.323 --> 01:38.256

01:39.965 --> 01:42.032
off camera, in the hallway,

01:42.134 --> 01:43.865
you hear this lady yell,
through the wall,

and horror on their faces

01:56.617 --> 01:58.579

And the porno-girl
who's, like,

02:02.081 --> 02:05.888
taking it from behind-ish,
says something defiant, like,

02:05.990 --> 02:07.959
"Good!" under her breath,

02:08.061 --> 02:09.689

see her soul

right then and there.

11:06.726 --> 11:07.930
I think...

11:08.665 --> 11:12.270
it is good to be religious.

11:12.372 --> 11:13.530
Well, our work here is done.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.771
(CHUCKLES) No. I just want you
to know that before we start.

11:16.873 --> 11:18.572
Yeah, I think
that we would consider

11:18.674 --> 11:20.839
that refreshing to hear.

11:20.941 --> 11:22.241
Well, sometimes, it feels like

11:22.343 --> 11:25.910
maybe religion isn't at
the center of culture anymore.

11:26.012 --> 11:27.185
Well, it's fading, isn't it?

My mother was a convert,
so, um,

11:54.006 --> 11:55.040
when my dad passed away,

11:55.142 --> 11:56.644
we auditioned
a few different churches,

11:56.746 --> 11:58.175
just to see what was out there

11:58.277 --> 11:59.416
and see if we still
believed in it.

12:00.651 --> 12:01.651
I know that feeling very well.

to find your faith

12:03.887 --> 12:05.788
in a doctrine
you actually believe,

very personal struggle.

- (BARNES LAUGHING)
- I'm just saying

12:31.780 --> 12:33.243
that I could tell that you

are a very spiritually
curious person,

12:37.049 --> 12:38.351
just like Joseph Smith.

many different denominations,

12:41.628 --> 12:44.692
Presbyterian, Methodist,
Catholicism.

12:44.794 --> 12:45.992
And none of them quite fit,

my question is,

16:47.202 --> 16:48.732
how do you feel
about polygamy?

16:52.376 --> 16:54.441
How do you... how do you feel
about the concept of

16:55.209 --> 16:57.213
a man having multiple wives?

16:59.479 --> 17:03.153
I mean, it's...
it's not for me, um...

17:03.255 --> 17:07.124
BARNES: Are you asking
from a biblical perspective?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.022
MR. REED: Uh, Mormonism
has a controversial history

17:09.124 --> 17:10.222
with the misogynist practice

17:10.324 --> 17:11.590
of men claiming
multiple wives.

17:11.692 --> 17:15.492
But I am fascinated by
the idea of Modern Revelation,

17:15.594 --> 17:17.766
which was used
to erase this behavior

17:17.868 --> 17:18.903
from the church in 1890.

17:19.005 --> 17:21.372
I just think
that's worthy of conversation.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.167
Yeah? Uh...

17:23.269 --> 17:24.237
And what I mean by that

17:24.339 --> 17:26.272
is that we're discussing
a church that

17:26.374 --> 17:28.145
decided that
a controversial practice

17:28.247 --> 17:30.675
was a stain on its reputation,
and an actual hindrance

17:30.777 --> 17:34.214
to recruiting new members,
and so it used revelation,

17:34.316 --> 17:36.117
word of God
told unto the prophet

17:36.219 --> 17:38.648
to banish a provocative
religious pillar

17:38.750 --> 17:41.225
that seemed unsavory
in contemporary times.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.421
Yeah, I know that, um,

17:43.523 --> 17:46.392
it may be difficult
to understand, um,

17:46.494 --> 17:49.733
but, uh, polygamy
was a spiritual mission

17:49.835 --> 17:51.494
needed at the time in order

17:51.596 --> 17:53.003
to grow the ranks
of our membership

17:53.105 --> 17:55.773
in the wake of much hardship
and bloodshed.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.406
Um...
a man having plural wives

17:58.508 --> 18:02.344
meant more... more babies
to help the community grow.

18:03.745 --> 18:05.182

- to our modern brains.
- BARNES: And it was...

18:11.619 --> 18:13.318
it was removed from the church
not just because

18:13.420 --> 18:14.959
it was grotesque
or controversial,

18:15.061 --> 18:17.854
but just because
it wasn't necessary anymore.

18:19.358 --> 18:22.629
You see, I worry, and...

18:23.131 --> 18:26.668
forgive my loud language,

18:26.770 --> 18:27.798
uh, (CHUCKLES)

18:27.900 --> 18:30.568
I worry that Joseph Smith
used the concept of polygamy

18:30.670 --> 18:34.176
to legitimize his affairs
with other women.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.343
I worry that Joseph's wife,
Emma Smith,

18:36.445 --> 18:38.683
was upset when he slept
with Fanny Alger,

18:38.785 --> 18:42.050
their sixteen-year-old maid.

18:42.152 --> 18:44.185
I worry that
he formulated a plan

18:44.287 --> 18:47.221
to use revelation
for consequence-free sex

18:47.323 --> 18:49.252
in the aftermath
of that indiscretion

18:49.354 --> 18:50.689

MR. REED: I guess what I would
pose to the room is my concern

19:03.001 --> 19:06.703
that polygamy has no
spiritual bearing whatsoever.

19:06.805 --> 19:10.244
That is somewhat
of a distortion, I think...

19:10.346 --> 19:12.675
The church's own history
corroborates

19:12.777 --> 19:15.116
and implies this...

19:18.922 --> 19:20.354
I... I... I'm sorry,

19:20.456 --> 19:22.488
I... I'm not sure
where you're getting this.

19:22.591 --> 19:26.162
If revelation by God
is filtered through man

19:26.264 --> 19:29.560
and man is flawed
and man sins and man lies,

19:29.662 --> 19:32.664
then how do we know
any of it's true?

19:32.766 --> 19:35.269
We know it's true because
of how it makes us feel.

19:35.371 --> 19:37.734
Bingo! (CHUCKLES)
That's exactly right!

What's Carl's Junior?

20:01.428 --> 20:03.000
Hardee's on the East Coast.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.627
Burger King is better
than Hardee's

20:04.729 --> 20:05.868
which is better
than Rally's...

20:05.970 --> 20:07.137
- Rally's?
- Checkers.

- Burger King is better

20:08.670 --> 20:10.033

which is better than Checkers,

20:10.135 --> 20:11.634
which is better than Wendy's,
which is better than In-N-Out,

20:11.736 --> 20:12.735

than McDonalds,

20:12.837 --> 20:14.042

than Jack in the Box,

20:14.144 --> 20:15.211

20:15.313 --> 20:16.475
Jack in the Box serves

studying theology,

20:47.279 --> 20:49.307
the last thing
I wanted to do was find...

20:49.409 --> 20:51.982
the Wendy's of religions.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.043
I was just writing
a research paper

20:54.145 --> 20:56.549
for a college class, and I was
content with dabbling.

20:56.652 --> 20:59.650
So, some McNuggets here,
BK Whopper over there,

20:59.752 --> 21:02.621
whatever fit the mood.

i.e., Mormonism, Scientology,
Islam, Buddhism,

21:11.299 --> 21:13.631
as I got closer to God

21:13.733 --> 21:17.669
through genre
and rigorous study,

21:17.771 --> 21:20.278
as I worked
on my personal relationship

21:20.380 --> 21:23.413
with Heavenly Father,
and I think strengthened it,

21:24.378 --> 21:25.976
do you know what I found?

I was malnourished

I'd been packing into my brain

21:47.936 --> 21:51.540

held under the microscope.

what else was out there.

43:49.588 --> 43:50.725

many, many times before,

43:52.792 --> 43:54.958

43:58.129 --> 44:00.399

44:00.501 --> 44:01.604
MR. REED: Okay.

44:01.706 --> 44:04.472
There are three major
monotheistic religions,

44:04.574 --> 44:08.541
Judaism, Christianity
and Islam.

44:08.643 --> 44:10.812
I call them, "The Big Three."

Judaism, i.e.

44:14.549 --> 44:16.179
"The Original Edition."

44:16.281 --> 44:19.551
Christianity, i.e.
"The Most Popular Edition,"

44:19.653 --> 44:23.056
and Islam, "The Newer,

44:23.592 --> 44:25.387
"Second Most Popular Edition."

44:26.762 --> 44:29.391

44:30.795 --> 44:31.998

spin-off edition."

many of the same characters

45:34.559 --> 45:35.898
Yes?

45:36.000 --> 45:38.665
The Hollies filed a plagiarism
lawsuit against Radiohead,

45:38.767 --> 45:40.033
which they later settled
by proving

45:40.135 --> 45:42.798
that the melody and rhythm
of <i>The Air That I Breathe</i>

45:42.900 --> 45:44.504
appear in <i>Creep.</i>

45:45.941 --> 45:47.443

Lana Del Rey,

45:49.042 --> 45:50.942

by Radiohead

45:51.044 --> 45:54.578

of the world's population.

46:21.839 --> 46:23.039
Why is that?

46:23.141 --> 46:25.445
Why is the original
less popular

46:25.547 --> 46:26.274
than the iteration?

46:26.376 --> 46:29.247
Is it any less true
than the others?

46:30.515 --> 46:34.816
Are we talking about religion
or board games or music?

46:34.918 --> 46:36.287
MR. REED: Yes.

46:36.389 --> 46:40.463
It has the fewest members
because it doesn't advertise.

46:40.565 --> 46:41.864
