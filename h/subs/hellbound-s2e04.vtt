WEBVTT

00:12.887 --> 00:16.391
Chairman Jung clearly emphasized
the importance of following God's will

00:16.474 --> 00:19.019
by actively pursuing justice and good.

00:19.728 --> 00:20.854
Next slide, please.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.272
A COMPARISON OF JUNG AND PARK

00:23.398 --> 00:27.068
When an unexpected question came up
in his last interview,

00:27.152 --> 00:31.614
he inadvertently said
God has given us the ability to do so.

00:32.115 --> 00:37.537
And now the Arrowhead is propagating it
as if it were his primary doctrine.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.708
However, the idea that each person
carries a code of conduct

00:41.791 --> 00:44.627
ultimately means
that there is no such code.

00:44.711 --> 00:49.424
Therefore, our main goal would be
to realign these conflicting codes,

00:49.507 --> 00:52.969
thought to reside
in the arbitrary realm of people's minds,

00:53.053 --> 00:55.346
back into the framework of God's New Will.

00:55.889 --> 00:59.684
Accomplishing this
should dispel the misconception

00:59.768 --> 01:02.687
that joining the demonstration
will lead to forgiveness,

01:02.771 --> 01:04.981
a belief stemming
from the baby's demonstration.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.358
With that in mind--

01:07.442 --> 01:08.902
Listen here!

01:09.402 --> 01:12.572
We've already debunked
and clarified that issue!

01:13.156 --> 01:15.283
Why reiterate that it's wrong?

01:15.366 --> 01:17.202
People refuse to believe us anyway!

01:17.285 --> 01:18.995
There's no need to get upset.

01:21.623 --> 01:25.794
Analyzing logic and dissecting it
is just what professors do.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.046
Why are you getting so worked up?

01:31.216 --> 01:36.971
I trust the professors
will come up with a solid new doctrine.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.140
You're the experts.

01:39.641 --> 01:42.435
There's one thing I'd like to request.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.481
It's about the script
that the Resurrected One will read out.

01:47.482 --> 01:48.900
That's what's important.

01:48.983 --> 01:52.946
It should be very concise and powerful.

01:53.029 --> 01:57.408
It should sound insightful initially,

01:57.492 --> 02:03.748
but the more you ponder it,
the more perplexing it becomes.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.583
Something like that.

02:07.418 --> 02:08.628
Don't you get it?

02:11.798 --> 02:13.133
The thing about words

02:13.216 --> 02:16.803
is that the ones
with confusing and ambiguous meanings

02:16.886 --> 02:22.142
that seem to make sense in any context

02:22.725 --> 02:25.770
tend to stick around for a long time.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.691
Never try to make people understand.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.069
What they understand, they analyze.

02:33.153 --> 02:38.032
And once they start analyzing,
you will never be feared or admired.

02:41.369 --> 02:42.245
Understand?

02:42.912 --> 02:45.623
Right, yes. We'll do as you said.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.709
All right. Let's continue.

02:47.792 --> 02:48.835
- Okay.
- All right.

02:48.918 --> 02:52.714
Up next, we have Ms. Park Yulgeum,

02:52.797 --> 02:55.675
a world-class designer
who oversees our visuals.

02:55.758 --> 02:57.969
She will update us on her progress.

03:09.981 --> 03:13.902
The theme of this design
is "transcendence."

03:14.652 --> 03:18.907
By portraying an image of a being
transcending human limitations,

03:18.990 --> 03:21.743
our goal is to ensure
that the Resurrected One's message

03:21.826 --> 03:24.913
resonates deeply
with the hearts of the audience

03:24.996 --> 03:27.081
rather than their minds.

03:27.957 --> 03:31.711
I've visualized her association
with the New Truth

03:31.794 --> 03:35.048
by incorporating
the color of the deacons' uniform

03:35.131 --> 03:36.841
and creating a design

03:36.925 --> 03:42.222
that combines divine grandeur
with aristocratic moderation.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.683
Regarding the makeup,

03:45.767 --> 03:50.396
I intend to emphasize her existence
as surpassing human boundaries

03:50.480 --> 03:55.068
while maintaining
her inherent facial characteristics.

03:55.151 --> 03:58.780
This way,
we'll be able to effectively convey

03:58.863 --> 04:03.826
that the Sinner Park Jungja
we used to know

04:03.910 --> 04:06.412
has risen from the dead and returned.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.065
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

04:35.441 --> 04:38.695
MOTEL SMILE

05:34.834 --> 05:36.169
Let's eat first.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.718
Do we just wait around like this?

05:44.510 --> 05:47.597
I messaged them from my wife's account.
I'm sure they'll see it.

05:48.097 --> 05:52.226
The Arrowhead got very cautious
once Park's resurrection was announced.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.484
You said Pinwheel had
the biggest influence on the Arrowhead.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.444
Are you certain?

06:01.527 --> 06:04.072
He goes around doing live broadcasts.

06:04.155 --> 06:07.283
The Arrowhead is pretty much
under his control now.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.204
About my demonstration--

06:11.287 --> 06:12.872
I didn't tell them you were back.

06:13.956 --> 06:16.793
People don't know
about your demonstration anyway.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.603
Your eyes seemed to be troubling you.
Maybe these will help.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.149
Thank you.

06:42.693 --> 06:43.861
These might help.

06:51.077 --> 06:51.911
They replied!

06:53.454 --> 06:55.206
They're an hour away. Let's go.

07:18.479 --> 07:19.689
Let me ask you something.

07:20.606 --> 07:22.400
Why the Arrowhead?

07:24.986 --> 07:26.821
Wouldn't the New Truth be better?

07:28.030 --> 07:31.576
The New Truth and Sodo
never had any faith.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.494
Their sole focus is on

07:34.162 --> 07:37.290
using these strange phenomena
for their own gain.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.793
The world is in this mess

07:41.627 --> 07:43.504
because of fanaticism.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.550
And to fix the mess caused by fanaticism,

07:48.634 --> 07:52.555
we must first fix the craziest fanatics,
like the Arrowhead.

07:57.143 --> 07:57.977
Let's go.

08:09.906 --> 08:11.199
Senior Secretary Lee?

08:12.116 --> 08:13.367
Hello there.

08:13.868 --> 08:14.702
Hi.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.413
What brings you here this time?

08:18.247 --> 08:20.416
I came to ask you something.

08:21.125 --> 08:22.043
Have a seat.

08:30.510 --> 08:35.097
My staff analyzed
Park Jungja's interview records

08:36.432 --> 08:37.767
and found something interesting.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.768
Interesting?

08:39.268 --> 08:42.980
Yes. During her interview
with Vice Chairman Oh two years ago,

08:43.064 --> 08:47.151
Park Jungja mentioned a Mercedes
out of the blue.

08:47.693 --> 08:51.072
In another interview
with Advisor Jung Yongcheol,

08:51.155 --> 08:53.533
she mentioned a silk pillow.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.035
She's always been like that.

08:56.118 --> 08:58.996
She speaks gibberish out of the blue.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.291
She couldn't communicate at all
until I stepped in.

09:03.793 --> 09:04.794
"Gibberish"?

09:06.128 --> 09:10.216
Right. However, in her interview
with Vice Chairman Lee Sanggil,

09:11.467 --> 09:13.386
she mentioned the name "Lee Yumi."

09:14.178 --> 09:15.012
Who?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.973
Vice Chairman Lee Sanggil?

09:17.056 --> 09:21.269
Yes, he died six months ago from a stroke.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.356
So what did you find out?

09:27.024 --> 09:29.318
We did some digging

09:29.402 --> 09:31.821
and found out that the name of the doctor

09:32.405 --> 09:36.117
who performed CPR on the vice chairman
until he was declared dead

09:36.951 --> 09:37.868
was Lee Yumi.

09:42.039 --> 09:42.915
So…

09:44.375 --> 09:48.713
so what are you trying to say?

09:50.006 --> 09:54.343
The things Park Jungja says
may not all be random gibberish.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.846
I thought

09:58.264 --> 10:01.892
she could perhaps see
the moment of people's deaths.

10:05.938 --> 10:09.233
Of course, this is all just speculation.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.319
It's just hypothetical.

10:11.402 --> 10:14.322
But to see if it's true,

10:14.405 --> 10:17.742
we need to check how the interviewers die.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.328
But since Park Jungja never mentions

10:20.411 --> 10:23.497
the time of their death
or anything like that,

10:23.581 --> 10:27.084
it's difficult to verify this hypothesis.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
Yes. I guess you're right.

10:32.381 --> 10:38.387
Is Park Jungja's current state
going to affect our future plans?

10:41.015 --> 10:43.768
Well, I don't think so.

10:45.102 --> 10:49.398
But I've gone through all these records…

10:51.400 --> 10:54.695
and I couldn't find any record
of your interview with her.

10:55.488 --> 10:59.033
Did she say anything strange to you?

11:04.455 --> 11:05.790
Chairman Kim.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.584
You know,

11:10.336 --> 11:12.755
she says all kinds of nonsense,
so I don't quite…

11:16.550 --> 11:17.760
Right. Well,

11:19.095 --> 11:23.182
I'm not saying
that they are particularly meaningful.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.185
I'm so tired.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.187
I'd better get going.

11:28.729 --> 11:32.274
- How is the grand revival progressing?
- It's coming along.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.069
Okay. Keep up the good work.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.904
I'll see you later.

11:41.951 --> 11:42.952
You know,

11:43.619 --> 11:46.872
I went to see Park Jungja
before I came here.

11:46.956 --> 11:47.790
I was curious.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.166
Sorry?

11:50.418 --> 11:54.255
I asked her if she could see anything
when she looks at me.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.176
She said she couldn't see anything.

12:04.348 --> 12:05.850
I'll get going, then.

12:05.933 --> 12:08.352
Don't mind me. I'll see myself out.

12:51.228 --> 12:52.563
SOLAR TRAIN

13:20.800 --> 13:21.675
Hello?

13:21.759 --> 13:24.220
<i>Ms. Min, we have an emergency meeting.</i>

13:24.303 --> 13:25.387
<i>Where are you?</i>

13:26.013 --> 13:27.890
I'm close by. I'll be there soon.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.874
Resurrected One, are you napping?

13:58.921 --> 14:00.798
Well, did you have a dream?

14:06.095 --> 14:07.137
Listen.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.641
I came to ask you something.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.311
When I came to talk to you before,

14:15.437 --> 14:17.314
you said something, didn't you?

14:19.525 --> 14:20.442
What was it?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.237
I see…

14:25.906 --> 14:27.867
a bird like a phoenix…

14:30.744 --> 14:33.372
and colorful, beautiful scenery.

14:35.249 --> 14:37.042
That's what I see from you.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.711
What exactly are those things?

14:40.296 --> 14:42.298
I don't know what they are exactly.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.718
They're just feelings.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.722
Why do you ask?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.310
I forgot what you said.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.104
Am I…

14:59.732 --> 15:02.151
seeing people's deaths?

15:03.027 --> 15:03.861
What?

15:04.361 --> 15:06.280
I was just wondering

15:06.989 --> 15:09.074
if I have that kind of ability now.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.537
Perhaps.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.967
Can you also see when it will happen?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.720
No, I don't know anything like that.

15:31.263 --> 15:32.097
It's all images.

15:40.564 --> 15:44.526
That scenery you see from me,
what impression does it give you?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.445
Is it a negative one?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.406
No, not at all.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.367
Actually…

15:53.619 --> 15:56.288
it looks gorgeous and magnificent.

16:01.877 --> 16:02.711
By the way,

16:03.545 --> 16:05.839
when will you start

16:06.882 --> 16:08.092
your so-called plan?

16:08.884 --> 16:11.887
Our committee members
will soon explain in detail

16:11.971 --> 16:13.931
what you should do.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.350
You just need to do what we ask.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.772
Get some rest now. You'll be busy soon.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.281
What's going on?

16:31.865 --> 16:34.660
They haven't said much yet.
Please have a seat.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.586
<i>We lost Jung Jinsu.</i>

16:45.838 --> 16:47.089
<i>Are you serious?</i>

16:48.007 --> 16:51.176
<i>Didn't you say Cheon Sehyeong</i>
<i>was Miss Sunshine's husband?</i>

16:51.260 --> 16:54.430
<i>How can you be sure</i>
<i>he's not one of the Arrowhead fanatics?</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:57.599
<i>Many of our dedicated members</i>
<i>have family in the Arrowhead.</i>

16:57.683 --> 16:59.059
<i>We thoroughly checked--</i>

16:59.143 --> 17:02.730
<i>If he had been thoroughly checked,</i>
<i>this wouldn't have happened!</i>

17:02.813 --> 17:05.149
<i>What if he hands Jung</i>
<i>to the Arrowhead or the New Truth?</i>

17:05.232 --> 17:08.777
<i>The New Truth has already dominated</i>
<i>the media with Park's resurrection.</i>

17:10.279 --> 17:12.114
<i>Now, a leader who returned from Hell?</i>

17:12.614 --> 17:14.491
<i>How on earth will we deal with that?</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:16.452
<i>That won't happen.</i>

17:17.244 --> 17:21.874
<i>It seems like he decided to punish</i>
<i>Jung Jinsu himself out of vengeance.</i>

17:22.624 --> 17:24.877
<i>We're tracking him. We'll find him soon.</i>

17:33.635 --> 17:34.845
Stop.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.403
Can I help you?

17:51.945 --> 17:53.989
I'm here to see Mr. Pinwheel.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.742
I'm Cheon Sehyeong,
Miss Sunshine's husband.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.124
See that bike?

18:05.000 --> 18:05.876
Follow it.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.798
- Hey, let them through.
- Open it.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.223
This way.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.432
Come on, move it.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.457
Cut it out!

19:27.541 --> 19:28.959
Come on.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.045
CHANCE NIGHTCLUB

19:32.671 --> 19:33.797
He's here.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.476
Are you him?

19:47.269 --> 19:48.896
Miss Sunshine's husband?

19:52.232 --> 19:55.235
Hello. I'm Cheon Sehyeong.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.154
Who did you bring?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.531
It's impressive.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.619
People following God's will
are gathered at a place

20:05.078 --> 20:07.915
where people used to come
for momentary pleasure.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.583
What the hell?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.103
So it's true.

20:33.148 --> 20:36.151
It really is you. For real!

20:40.614 --> 20:42.115
It's Chairman Jung Jinsu.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.536
Chairman Jung Jinsu. I…

20:48.038 --> 20:49.248
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.795
I've waited so long for you!

20:55.379 --> 20:58.006
I've waited so long for you!

20:59.424 --> 21:02.177
I knew you'd come back to save us

21:03.553 --> 21:05.681
from a world ruined by the fake chairman.

21:11.770 --> 21:12.813
I'm impressed.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.898
It must've been hard.

21:15.816 --> 21:20.487
Yet you fought against the world
with such strong faith all these years.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.405
No.

21:22.072 --> 21:22.906
Not at all.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.411
I have been living for this very moment.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.589
How is your health? Is it good?

21:40.966 --> 21:43.427
Please have a seat.
We have a lot to talk about.

21:43.510 --> 21:45.470
Mr. Cheon, you should wait over there.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.597
- Wait, but…
- Come on.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.227
We have a place for you to wait.

22:00.277 --> 22:01.611
You can wait here.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.529
Right.

22:04.156 --> 22:07.617
But there's something I need to tell him.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.501
I still-- When can I talk to--

22:18.670 --> 22:19.504
Hello?

22:20.297 --> 22:22.424
Hello? Open the door, please!

22:25.010 --> 22:25.844
Hey!

22:26.928 --> 22:28.221
Please open the door!

22:28.764 --> 22:31.558
Let me out! You bastards!

22:32.059 --> 22:32.893
Open the door!

22:34.102 --> 22:35.354
- Let me out!
- What a pain.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.439
- Open the door!
- You two guard the door.

22:37.522 --> 22:38.940
- All right.
- Let me out!

22:40.233 --> 22:42.819
Open this… Please let me out!

22:43.528 --> 22:46.198
<i>Let's discuss our rescue plan</i>
<i>for Park Jungja.</i>

22:46.990 --> 22:48.492
<i>We're out.</i>

22:48.575 --> 22:49.910
<i>We're out too.</i>

22:49.993 --> 22:52.329
<i>We already agreed in our last meeting.</i>

22:52.412 --> 22:54.998
<i>Things are different now, aren't they?</i>

22:55.082 --> 22:58.460
<i>We should blow up the entire place</i>
<i>to stop the New Will announcement.</i>

22:58.543 --> 23:00.003
<i>Why do we need to rescue her?</i>

23:00.087 --> 23:02.381
<i>I'm all for blowing the place up.</i>

23:02.464 --> 23:05.717
<i>Right now,</i>
<i>it would look like the Arrowhead's doing.</i>

23:06.218 --> 23:10.514
<i>It could stop the announcement</i>
<i>and undermine the Arrowhead's influence.</i>

23:11.014 --> 23:13.809
When did we become a terrorist group?

23:15.560 --> 23:19.022
<i>That's why we're pulling out.</i>
<i>Because we're not terrorists.</i>

23:19.106 --> 23:21.775
<i>Mr. Kim Sungjip and Ms. Min Hyejin.</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:26.071
<i>Good luck rescuing her peacefully.</i>

23:28.615 --> 23:30.951
I'll go alone. That was my plan anyway.

23:31.034 --> 23:35.288
<i>No, you're the symbol of Sodo.</i>
<i>I can't let you go alone.</i>

23:36.331 --> 23:39.876
I must be a burden, not a symbol.
Everyone seems reluctant to act.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.254
<i>I'll come up with a rescue plan.</i>

23:43.004 --> 23:44.881
<i>I'll call you when I'm done.</i>

24:10.240 --> 24:12.242
Do you know why I am called Pinwheel?

24:13.326 --> 24:16.163
A pinwheel doesn't have a will of its own.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.124
It just spins whenever the wind blows.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.962
I can't believe you came to me.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.339
I always knew this day would come.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.259
To fix this world,

24:30.093 --> 24:31.761
we need people like you.

24:33.013 --> 24:36.391
What do we do?
Should I go live and announce your return?

24:36.475 --> 24:40.353
No. I think we should delay
the announcement of my return.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.189
Why?

24:44.191 --> 24:45.150
Before anything…

24:47.152 --> 24:49.779
I want to meet Ms. Park,
known as the Resurrected One.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.573
Ms. Park Jungja?

24:52.657 --> 24:54.534
Right. Yes, of course.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.412
If anyone should meet her, it's you.

24:57.496 --> 24:58.538
Absolutely.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.166
If they find out I'm back,

25:02.626 --> 25:05.253
they'll never let me meet her.

25:06.254 --> 25:09.257
The government and the New Truth
will do everything they can.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.259
I must go there myself

25:12.093 --> 25:14.804
and meet Park Jungja in secret.

25:16.056 --> 25:18.266
We'll announce the real truth

25:18.350 --> 25:22.270
instead of the false doctrine
the New Truth is coercing her to tell.

25:23.772 --> 25:27.275
So then, you will be on the podium and…

25:27.359 --> 25:29.778
On the stage the New Truth has set up,

25:29.861 --> 25:32.280
you, together with the Resurrected One…

25:36.201 --> 25:38.954
And also with you, Mr. Pinwheel.

25:45.752 --> 25:47.587
I wouldn't dare…

25:48.463 --> 25:51.132
You've been protecting God's will
on my behalf.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.384
It'd only be right.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.562
I'm so glad to be alive!

26:06.898 --> 26:11.861
I've been holding back my urge
to plunge into the flames of purgation.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.699
It must've all been for this moment.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.995
I'll do anything to get you there.

26:20.078 --> 26:24.124
I'm going to make sure
Park Jungja stands next to you!

26:29.337 --> 26:30.463
By the way,

26:31.298 --> 26:35.010
what should we do
about Miss Sunshine's husband?

26:47.647 --> 26:48.481
Jiwon.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.901
GRAND ASSEMBLY
FOR THE DECLARATION OF THE NEW WILL

28:23.576 --> 28:25.412
- Are you going now?
- Yes.

28:25.495 --> 28:28.164
- Please look after Jaehyeon.
- Of course.

28:30.750 --> 28:31.793
Be careful.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.640
So what's our plan?

28:46.141 --> 28:47.225
Once we're there

28:48.226 --> 28:49.686
and everyone joins us,

28:50.228 --> 28:51.312
I'll tell you.

28:56.109 --> 28:57.277
Take this.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.329
I got one for you and one for myself.

29:21.301 --> 29:22.635
What are you doing?

29:23.261 --> 29:25.221
I just need one bullet.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.558
I only need them to believe
that the gun is loaded.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.565
It's going to be a long day.

30:18.566 --> 30:21.194
We're going to go get Park Jungja now.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.111
And then?

30:23.029 --> 30:25.031
Are you going to get Park Jungja

30:26.199 --> 30:29.035
and try to save the world?

30:31.120 --> 30:32.831
I hate to break it to you…

30:35.041 --> 30:37.836
but I don't care
what happens to this world anymore.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.506
What?

30:42.465 --> 30:45.510
During my time in Hell,
I was in countless different worlds.

30:48.471 --> 30:49.973
And I'm not even sure…

30:51.975 --> 30:53.101
if this is the real one.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.480
Then why do you want to meet Park Jungja?

31:11.661 --> 31:13.079
When I look in the mirror…

31:16.833 --> 31:18.626
I see the executors.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.756
The ones that ripped me apart
and burned me endlessly.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.847
I see them…

31:36.102 --> 31:37.604
chasing me in the mirror.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.731
They chase me…

31:42.442 --> 31:44.235
and suffocate me.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.492
How much longer will this go on?

31:55.455 --> 31:56.789
Will it ever end?

31:59.208 --> 32:00.209
Park Jungja.

32:02.545 --> 32:03.463
I thought…

32:07.091 --> 32:08.635
she might know the answer.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.268
Then what have I been doing all this time?

32:34.661 --> 32:36.454
Do you know why you ended up like this?

32:39.999 --> 32:42.377
Because you left everything
in the hands of others.

32:43.461 --> 32:47.423
Your wife's life,
her death, and her revenge.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.968
You left it all to others.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.349
You even left your last chance up to me.

33:02.313 --> 33:04.357
There is nothing you can find out

33:05.400 --> 33:07.110
on your own.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.868
- Get your hands off!
- He's deceiving you all!

33:16.494 --> 33:18.121
Jung Jinsu is crazy!

33:18.204 --> 33:21.958
He's a lunatic who came back from Hell!
Jung Jinsu is a sinner!

33:22.041 --> 33:22.959
Jung Jinsu is--

33:34.887 --> 33:35.847
I hope

33:36.889 --> 33:38.391
your wife is waiting for you.

33:58.161 --> 33:59.037
I get it now.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.207
I finally know what God's will is.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.670
He wants to give meaning
to something meaningless

34:08.755 --> 34:12.050
and fill the world
with people who kill each other.

34:13.926 --> 34:15.261
Do you know what that is?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.014
It's Hell.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.475
God is trying

34:22.143 --> 34:25.229
to turn this world into Hell!

34:27.690 --> 34:29.233
I finally get it!

35:04.227 --> 35:09.816
Park Jungja! The Resurrected One!

36:02.535 --> 36:06.873
A lot of our members
are also on standby outside.

36:07.707 --> 36:12.336
They'll pretend to support the New Truth
and spring into action upon our signal.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.594
<i>A huge crowd has gathered</i>
<i>at the New Truth Square.</i>

36:20.094 --> 36:23.890
<i>Even the Arrowhead, which has been</i>
<i>clashing with the New Truth,</i>

36:23.973 --> 36:27.768
<i>appears to welcome the announcement</i>
<i>of the New Will by the Resurrected One.</i>

36:28.269 --> 36:31.105
<i>The police have announced</i>
<i>traffic control in the area</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:33.816
<i>to prevent any casualties</i>
<i>due to the large crowd.</i>

36:33.900 --> 36:35.610
<i>In case of unforeseen circumstances,</i>

36:35.693 --> 36:38.988
<i>emergency personnel</i>
<i>are also on standby at the scene.</i>

36:53.419 --> 36:56.881
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One,
will appear soon!

36:56.964 --> 37:00.760
All members of the Arrowhead,
heed God's message!

37:00.843 --> 37:06.474
We, the Arrowhead, welcome the New Will
from Park Jungja, the Resurrected One!

37:07.808 --> 37:08.851
Where is everyone?

37:09.644 --> 37:15.066
The Resurrected One! The Arrowhead!

37:20.988 --> 37:22.573
Ma'am, over there.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.452
Are we supposed to do this with them?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.871
What exactly is the plan?

37:36.128 --> 37:38.422
Thank you for coming all this way.

37:44.637 --> 37:45.471
I'm sorry.

37:45.554 --> 37:46.889
Please don't be.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.436
I believe this is my mission.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.861
It's an honor to meet you.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.993
Could I please shake your hand?

38:07.743 --> 38:08.619
Sure.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.629
Please.

38:20.256 --> 38:23.843
Help Ms. Park Jungja meet her children.

38:54.248 --> 38:56.167
Camera A, check. Camera B, check.

38:56.917 --> 38:58.127
We're going live now.

38:59.086 --> 39:00.671
Five, four,

39:01.172 --> 39:03.883
three, two, one.

39:07.219 --> 39:10.556
All right! All members of the Arrowhead
in the country!

39:10.639 --> 39:12.600
As I previously mentioned,

39:12.683 --> 39:18.814
today's broadcast will expose
every single lie the New Truth has told!

39:18.898 --> 39:21.275
<i>This broadcast will change history!</i>

39:21.359 --> 39:23.694
<i>We've got an amazing surprise for you!</i>

39:23.778 --> 39:26.447
<i>Pay attention, everyone!</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:35.164
Just relax and do as we practiced, okay?

39:36.457 --> 39:39.418
You just need to read
the script displayed on the screen.

39:46.092 --> 39:47.718
The chairman is coming onstage.

40:32.054 --> 40:34.098
THE RESURRECTED ONE
PLEASE TEACH US GOD'S WILL

40:51.866 --> 40:53.659
What are you doing? Get started!

41:05.713 --> 41:07.214
Go!

41:07.298 --> 41:09.592
- It's the Arrowhead!
- Run!

41:13.679 --> 41:18.434
The New Truth is trying to impose
false doctrine using Park Jungja tonight!

41:18.517 --> 41:21.854
Today, we are going to expose their lies!

41:46.921 --> 41:47.755
I…

41:49.131 --> 41:51.217
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One…

42:03.062 --> 42:04.355
What's going on?

42:08.317 --> 42:09.401
That's right.

42:09.485 --> 42:11.111
Come at me.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.942
Your plan was to involve
someone who received a decree?

42:50.818 --> 42:52.152
All right, let's move!

43:03.330 --> 43:05.416
Hey! Take Park Jungja!

43:05.499 --> 43:06.834
- Yes, sir!
- Hurry!

43:08.669 --> 43:10.045
- Bring her inside.
- Hurry!

43:10.129 --> 43:11.171
This way, sir!

45:40.946 --> 45:45.033
