REPORTER:
For thirty-one years,

12:48.644 --> 12:51.563
the Queen Mary served
as a majestic city of the sea.

12:51.980 --> 12:54.775
Now she's dropped anchor
for the final time.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.193
Closing out a career

12:56.193 --> 12:59.488
unequalled in the history of
commercial sea voyaging.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.532
A career that took her
through a depression,

13:01.532 --> 13:05.035
a world war,
a period of unequalled glory,

13:05.035 --> 13:06.787
and a last great voyage.

13:06.787 --> 13:09.373
CAPTAIN:Well, I would describe
this Queen Mary's
the most elegant

13:09.373 --> 13:12.751
and the finest ship that has
ever sailed any of the oceans.

13:12.751 --> 13:15.128
CREW MEMBER:The saddest
thing is,
I think, to ever happen

13:15.128 --> 13:18.590
because this has got to
be one of the most
beautiful ships that was, er...

13:18.590 --> 13:19.967
anyone's ever built.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.635
(jazz music)

13:21.635 --> 13:24.304
MAN:We feel that The Queen Mary
will be sort of

13:24.304 --> 13:27.307
the crown jewel in what
we hope will be

13:27.307 --> 13:32.104
the foremost water recreation
development in the entire
United States.

13:32.104 --> 13:35.315
MAN:Their predictions
are as high as
two and a half million
people a year

13:35.315 --> 13:40.070
will be coming down
to visit and board
The Queen Mary for its
various activities.

13:42.614 --> 13:46.910
PATRICK: The quality of the work
and the story that you
tell, the pictures,

13:46.910 --> 13:49.997
that's all very...quality,
the quality...

13:50.706 --> 13:52.915
-Dad! Dad!
-Hey, son!

13:53.750 --> 13:55.043
I have missed you.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.170
(chuckles) Me too!

13:56.837 --> 13:59.965
-Hi, Patrick.
-Hey...Anne.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.550
Glad you made it,

14:01.758 --> 14:03.302
although you are a little late,
but that's fine.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.095
-Sorry.
-I rung ahead, let them know.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.722
You wanna go through it again,
or...?

14:07.222 --> 14:08.265
-The pitch?
-Yeah.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.475
Um, I'm good if you are?

14:10.475 --> 14:13.187
I'm, I'm good.
-Er, well, although, er...

14:13.478 --> 14:16.982
the publisher thinks a more
holistic approach is needed.

14:17.441 --> 14:22.779
Um, books, website, 3D tour?

14:23.614 --> 14:24.823
TOUR GUIDE: Guests have reported
(camera shutter clicks)

14:24.823 --> 14:26.575
seeing a woman in white,
playing piano.

14:26.575 --> 14:29.036
A war bride, who,
after learning her husband died

14:29.036 --> 14:31.455
serving in France,
took her own life.

14:32.206 --> 14:35.209
You can pick up a
limited-edition
doll
of the woman in white

14:35.209 --> 14:37.044
in the gift shop
on your way out.

14:37.336 --> 14:41.131
Next, we'll see where
Fred Astaire
once danced the cha cha.

14:41.131 --> 14:44.384
I'm half expecting Fred Astaire
to jump out and try
sell me a hoover.

14:44.384 --> 14:46.678
-So, what's this
about a 3D tour?
-Oh, sorry.

14:47.137 --> 14:49.056
Er, you know, I just thought
you could mention it to him.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.724
PATRICK: It, it's a
big thing to just
mention.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.725
There are no visuals,
no concept work.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.727
Besides we've been
through this...
-Hey, uh...

14:53.727 --> 14:55.312
-...the ship's almost
80 years old.
-Hey, Dad.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.772
-PATRICK: It deserves
something...
-I'm thirsty.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.273
...you can feel and touch.
Something that lasts.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.358
-Can I get a frappe?
-PATRICK: Er, sure.

14:59.358 --> 15:00.692
ANNE: No, honey.
Who lets a kid drink coffee?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.194
-Oh, come on!
-PATRICK: Fine.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.362
ANNE: Hang on,
I'll give you water.

15:03.362 --> 15:04.321
LUKAS: Oh, forget it.

15:04.446 --> 15:05.656
With or without all this.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.366
But, er, you don't agree?

15:07.366 --> 15:09.660
No, I do, I do.
I think you're incredibly noble.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.286
-Well, thank you.
-And righteous.

15:11.286 --> 15:12.913
-Yeah, keep going.
-And have amazing intentions.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.957
I feel like the idea
is a little dated.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.291
I don't know what a book
is gonna do

15:16.291 --> 15:17.584
to save The Queen Mary.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.461
HOMELESS MAN: Get your God damn
freaking hands off me!

15:20.128 --> 15:21.797
(homeless man groans)

15:23.090 --> 15:25.092
If I catch you sneaking
in here one more time,

15:25.092 --> 15:27.302
I swear to God,
I'll crack your head open.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.971
PATRICK: So, I've been published
three times.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.889
ANNE: Oh, we're counting
academic papers now?

15:30.889 --> 15:32.474
PATRICK: All warmly received.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.934
(Anne and Patrick chatter)

15:33.934 --> 15:35.352
(tense music)

15:37.729 --> 15:39.481
Welcome to L.A.

15:39.481 --> 15:40.774
These days.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.651
So, what do you think?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.820
ANNE: Look, isn't
the real reason
you wanted to work on this...

15:44.820 --> 15:46.405
so you can spend time with...

15:48.824 --> 15:49.992
-PATRICK: Hey, buddy.
-(gasps)

15:49.992 --> 15:51.493
Huh? Yeah?

15:52.286 --> 15:54.955
Er...you wanna go on the
haunted tour

15:55.581 --> 15:57.165
while your mom has her
boring meeting?

15:57.165 --> 15:58.375
(chuckling)

15:58.375 --> 15:59.459
Yeah!

15:59.459 --> 16:00.627
(Patrick clears his throat)

16:00.878 --> 16:02.421
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

16:03.547 --> 16:04.590
Yeah.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.592
-Come on.
-Bye, Mom!

16:07.009 --> 16:08.051
(blows kiss)

16:08.051 --> 16:09.011
(suspenseful music)

16:10.387 --> 16:11.346
I'll be fine.

-Oh, Gibson.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.547
I've looked at your proposal.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.590
-Oh, right.
-Let's be clear,

17:28.715 --> 17:31.051
we're on the world's
fastest ocean liner.

17:31.635 --> 17:35.013
And all you're thinking about
is how to make us go faster.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.432
I like it.
-Yes, Sir, about that...

17:37.432 --> 17:38.809
-Passengers travel
on The Queen Mary

17:39.268 --> 17:41.728
because of two words,
Blue Riband.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.148
Not just an award for fastest
transatlantic crossing,

17:45.148 --> 17:46.483
but a guarantee.

17:46.859 --> 17:48.277
-Evening, gentlemen.
-OFFICERS: Captain.

17:48.402 --> 17:51.446
CARRADINE: So, if our rivals
want the title of
world's fastest,

17:51.446 --> 17:54.783
well, fuel consumption
is the new battle ground.

17:55.242 --> 17:56.535
Not propulsion.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.581
Slow? Gibson, why haven't you
rung off full ahead?

18:00.789 --> 18:03.500
Yes, Sir, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.961
(elevator music)
TOUR GUIDE: Standing
still would mean

18:05.961 --> 18:08.839
almost certain death
for a project of this magnitude.

18:09.590 --> 18:13.677
So, when the Great
Depression halted
construction for over a year,

18:13.677 --> 18:14.761
a deal was struck

18:14.887 --> 18:17.973
for Cunard to merge
with White Star Line.

18:18.307 --> 18:20.934
Owners of the ill-fated Titanic.

18:21.351 --> 18:24.354
Creating Cunard White Star.

18:25.147 --> 18:29.067
Steam was generated
in massive furnaces,

18:29.318 --> 18:34.323
superheated and passed to engine
at seven-hundred degrees
Fahrenheit.

18:34.323 --> 18:37.868
About four-hundred
pound per square inch. Phew!

18:38.118 --> 18:40.329
Now, I don't mean
to scare y'all,

18:40.495 --> 18:45.042
but this was the scene of an
accident in 1938,

18:45.042 --> 18:47.794
when steam built up
behind an emergency door,

18:47.961 --> 18:50.214
escaped, killing an engineer...
(mobile phone camera clicks)

18:50.339 --> 18:52.090
...shutting down
the main engine.

18:52.090 --> 18:56.261
Guests have since reported
hearing his haunting scream...

18:56.512 --> 18:57.930
-Dad!
...throughout the ship.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.306

TOUR GUIDE: She survived
head on collisions,

19:47.229 --> 19:51.358
Hitler's relentless
wolf packs and even
a one-hundred-foot rogue wave,

19:51.358 --> 19:53.986
causing many to believe
her blessed.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.805
-Miss.
-Oh, Miss Calder.

20:21.805 --> 20:24.141
Yes, yes. Hello, hello.
(mobile phone drops to floor)

20:24.141 --> 20:25.559
Um, Mr Torres?

20:25.559 --> 20:27.644
Er, no, er, Charles Bittner.

20:30.522 --> 20:31.648
Are you the historian?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.234
I'm our, er, humble Captain.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.028
(chuckles)

20:36.278 --> 20:40.449
I work directly with Mr Torres,
our historian. You were delayed?

20:41.158 --> 20:42.951
(soft music)
He asked if I'd fill in.

20:42.951 --> 20:44.494
Oh, please.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.581
(door opens, closes)

(ominous music)

21:31.917 --> 21:33.210

21:36.380 --> 21:37.840
(ghostly sounds)

21:43.053 --> 21:47.891
(metal door clangs open)
(door closes)

21:48.600 --> 21:50.686
(door locks clang shut)
(siren blares)

21:50.686 --> 21:51.812
CHIEF ENGINEER:
Pipes started shaking,

21:51.812 --> 21:53.063
so I reduced the speed.

21:53.063 --> 21:54.857
-And?
-Problem's coming from in there.

21:54.857 --> 21:56.191
(sizzle)
(chief engineer gasps)

21:56.984 --> 21:58.110
It's hot to the touch.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.820
I wouldn't venture in there.

21:59.820 --> 22:02.698
My guess is cracked steam pipes
and a cocktail of
superheated oil.

22:02.698 --> 22:04.908
That room is probably
700 degrees.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.243
We need to shut her
down, Captain.

22:06.243 --> 22:07.494
Let the engineers do their work.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.704
No.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.330
Reduce speed to 15 knots.

22:10.455 --> 22:13.917
-Captain, it only takes
a spark from...
- All that clatter down here,

22:13.917 --> 22:15.669
you must've lost your hearing.

22:15.836 --> 22:18.255
I said do not stop.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.091
By all means, find
a way to reduce
the pressure and speed.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.134
Gradually.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.969
But do not stop.

22:24.511 --> 22:28.223
And the next time you decide
to slow my ship without
my consent,

22:28.724 --> 22:30.267
I'll leave you at
the nearest port.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.435
Yes, Captain.

22:31.435 --> 22:32.811
(tense music)

22:38.650 --> 22:39.610
(seagulls crying)

22:51.288 --> 22:52.664

22:57.461 --> 22:58.754

23:07.888 --> 23:08.847

23:12.309 --> 23:13.268
H-hello?

23:15.062 --> 23:16.021

23:24.196 --> 23:25.656

23:37.084 --> 23:39.503
Are you lost?

23:40.629 --> 23:41.755
JACKIE: How old are you?

23:42.506 --> 23:43.465
Eight.

23:44.383 --> 23:45.384

23:49.012 --> 23:49.972

23:53.225 --> 23:54.393

23:55.185 --> 23:56.144

23:57.980 --> 23:58.939
(footsteps running)

24:07.614 --> 24:08.991
(water splashing)

24:11.451 --> 24:12.411
Hello?

24:12.870 --> 24:13.954
JACKIE: Down here.

24:20.711 --> 24:21.712
(tense music)

24:24.339 --> 24:25.340
(camera shutter clicks)

24:27.759 --> 24:36.935
(pages flip)

24:36.935 --> 24:38.896
I didn't know there still was
a ship's Captain.

24:38.896 --> 24:41.481
There is not.
But don't tell anyone.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.442
(scoffs)

24:44.067 --> 24:45.944
I just like the suit.

24:45.944 --> 24:49.823
(Anne chuckles)
So, why a book about
us, exactly?

24:49.823 --> 24:51.575
I am a digital marketing
consultant...
(phone rings)

24:51.575 --> 24:52.993
and my...

24:52.993 --> 24:54.953
...my son is obsessed
with ghost stories.

24:54.953 --> 24:56.955
(phone rings repeatedly)
A little too obsessed
actually and...

24:57.080 --> 24:58.790
MAN:Bittner, are you there?
(slams phone into cradle)

24:59.082 --> 25:00.834
Well, er, one day
he has this dream
and he says to me,

25:00.834 --> 25:02.920
"Mom, I had a dream
that I was on The Queen Mary."

25:02.920 --> 25:04.880
And I was like,
"Oh, you know, we
should go visit."

25:05.255 --> 25:08.342
And he said,
"No, I had a dream
we lived there."

25:08.634 --> 25:09.843
(laughs)

25:11.178 --> 25:12.262
Not kidding.

25:12.638 --> 25:14.389
And so, you know, it
got me thinking,

25:14.556 --> 25:18.185
um, what about doing a book
from a child's perspective?

25:18.185 --> 25:22.105
-Hmm.
-Exploring the ship
and some of the...

25:23.315 --> 25:24.650
stranger stories.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.195
-Ghost stories?
-Yes, the ghost stories.

25:29.613 --> 25:32.658
And also explore the
ship's rich history

25:32.658 --> 25:35.619
and we could raise awareness
and we could help save it.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.998
I didn't know we needed saving.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.459
Just what I see in the media.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.629
Stories.

25:46.004 --> 25:47.422
Right. Stories.

25:50.968 --> 25:53.095
You know, we're pretty
used to stories
around here,

25:53.095 --> 25:57.391
I mean, people have said we're
a doorway for the dead. (laughs)

25:57.391 --> 26:00.227
And although we're famous
for our fiction,

26:00.227 --> 26:03.021
you know, sometimes facts
can be much stranger.

26:03.021 --> 26:05.148
(tense music)

26:05.148 --> 26:10.737
Did you know in 1942, while, er,
transporting German and
Italian prisoners,

26:11.113 --> 26:13.615
she collided with one of our own
escort ships?

26:13.782 --> 26:18.453
Sank it.
Killing all but 99 of
its 400 sailors.

26:19.079 --> 26:23.375
And she just continued on
with little more than a scratch.

26:23.375 --> 26:24.501
(laughs)

26:24.626 --> 26:26.128
Would you take me on a tour?

26:27.337 --> 26:28.297
(clock chimes)

26:30.549 --> 26:31.508
(slow footsteps)

26:36.180 --> 26:37.639
(exhales)
Beautiful.

26:37.639 --> 26:40.684
Oh, yes, we have exactly
five hundred and ninety-six
working clocks

26:40.684 --> 26:41.727
aboard The Queen Mary.

26:41.727 --> 26:44.479
Wow. Really is a time
machine in here.

26:45.564 --> 26:47.649
We should definitely get
all these details in the book.

26:47.649 --> 26:50.068
Well, the Queen's Salon
was a social hub at night.

26:50.068 --> 26:51.653
Winston Churchill used
to sit over there,

26:51.653 --> 26:53.655
Alfred Hitchcock drank
his martini there,

26:53.655 --> 26:55.699
and Bob Hope wrote his
column over there.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.492
Tourists, they love that.

26:57.492 --> 26:59.745
You know, knowing what
famous people did,

26:59.995 --> 27:00.954
where they went.

27:01.079 --> 27:02.789
Is there anything else
you can show me?

27:03.582 --> 27:05.292
(camera shutter clicking)

27:08.754 --> 27:09.880
(bulb flashes)

27:13.509 --> 27:14.885
(loud footsteps, spurs jangling)

27:15.219 --> 27:16.053
(tense music)

27:28.857 --> 27:29.691
(Lukas panicking)

27:33.987 --> 27:35.447
(camera shutter clicks)

27:37.241 --> 27:39.576
(loud banging, ripping sounds)

27:40.619 --> 27:42.287
(camera shutter clicking)

27:42.412 --> 27:43.956
(dramatic music)

27:44.998 --> 27:46.625
(camera shutter clicking)

27:47.709 --> 27:48.919
(banging)

27:48.919 --> 27:50.003
(camera shutter clicking)

27:52.005 --> 27:53.674
(banging)

27:55.259 --> 27:56.510
(rope pulls)

27:56.510 --> 27:57.344
(banging)

27:57.469 --> 28:00.055
(Lukas screams)
(splash)

28:00.055 --> 28:01.807
(water rippling gently)

28:04.935 --> 28:07.729
(Lukas gasping for air)
(splashing)

28:07.729 --> 28:08.814
(tense music)

28:09.857 --> 28:11.066
(water gurgling)

28:12.526 --> 28:14.278
(dramatic music)

28:16.864 --> 28:17.823
(water lapping gently)

28:21.118 --> 28:23.495
BITTNER: People came here
to enjoy glamour.

28:23.954 --> 28:24.955
They still do.

28:25.289 --> 28:27.207
We host brunch on Sundays.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.209
Wedding receptions.
Corporate parties.

28:29.418 --> 28:31.336
You know, Bar-mitzvahs
and what-not.

28:32.337 --> 28:33.630
Oh, throughout the voyage,

28:34.131 --> 28:37.885
er, those ships marked
The Queen's Mary's
location along the Atlantic.

28:38.135 --> 28:42.681
Unfortunately, they
stopped working
after we permanently
docked in '67.

28:42.681 --> 28:46.226
We could capture these
fascinating details
in a wholly original way.

28:46.977 --> 28:48.770
Well, other people have
taken pictures.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.898
How do you propose
your book will be any different?

28:51.565 --> 28:53.942
The quality of the work
and the story you tell
with the pictures,

28:53.942 --> 28:55.736
that's all very important.
But...

28:56.069 --> 28:57.863
...have you ever thought about
virtual reality?

28:58.113 --> 29:00.240
Imagine taking a tour
of The Queen Mary.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.159
Not as it is now, but...

29:03.202 --> 29:08.207
as it was in, I don't know,
1938 or even 1944.

29:08.332 --> 29:10.000
What would that entail?

29:10.000 --> 29:12.586
On site time. Just the scanning.

29:12.878 --> 29:14.838
The coding we could
do from anywhere.

29:15.047 --> 29:20.427
But we would need to cover...
every inch of the ship.

29:22.721 --> 29:23.555
(ominous music)

29:24.598 --> 29:27.267
You're fucking kidding me?

29:28.101 --> 29:29.269
I'm sorry?

29:30.604 --> 29:32.272
Thank you, Miss Calder.

29:32.272 --> 29:35.317
I'll, er, pass this
along to Mr Torres
and we'll get back to you.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.693
(footsteps receding)

29:36.818 --> 29:37.945
(sighs)

29:39.488 --> 29:40.906
(suspenseful music)

29:44.159 --> 29:46.537
TOUR GUIDE:
Over here is the grand salon

29:46.537 --> 29:49.915
and, er, if you'll
all come this way,
we'll go to our...

29:49.915 --> 29:52.292
(frappe preparation sounds)

29:52.292 --> 29:53.794
(sucking on straw)

29:57.256 --> 29:58.423
(dramatic music)

29:58.423 --> 30:00.092
He seems traumatised.

30:00.467 --> 30:03.679
I just...sorry, I turned around,
he was just gone and I ...

30:05.305 --> 30:06.640
How'd the meeting go?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.058
Fine.

30:08.058 --> 30:10.185
Um, I was thinking,
if this book thing goes well,

30:10.310 --> 30:11.562
maybe we could try again.

30:11.687 --> 30:13.522
Settle down, buy a house.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.941
I'm the only one still
renting at my firm, so...

30:16.400 --> 30:20.654
Does now feel like
the right time
to be talking about this?

30:21.572 --> 30:22.739
All I wanna do is know

30:22.739 --> 30:25.117
that we're thinking
the same thing
for our son.

30:25.117 --> 30:27.828
'Cause Lukas needs stability,
we, we both need stability,
right?

30:27.828 --> 30:29.288
There is no 'we'.

30:29.288 --> 30:31.874
-And he's not your son.
-Come on.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.417
We, we, we raised him together.

30:33.417 --> 30:35.752
You can't just move
to another town
and shut me out.

30:35.752 --> 30:37.838
ANNE: Stop it, it's way overdue
we all moved on.

30:37.838 --> 30:41.049
PATRICK: I, I hear what
you're saying,
but it's a house, not a prison.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.217
(deck creaking)
ANNE: You always made it feel

30:42.217 --> 30:44.052
so God damn permanent.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.722
GWEN: Jackie, darling.

30:47.181 --> 30:49.224
(distorted) If I'm doing that I,
I'm not aware...

30:49.349 --> 30:51.185
GWEN: You mustn't worry.

30:51.185 --> 30:52.644
(quick footsteps)

30:54.104 --> 30:55.731
-...move to another town and...
-We have to move forward.

30:55.856 --> 30:58.025
GWEN: You're going
to a new home.

30:58.358 --> 30:59.943
GHOST VOICE:
(distorted) This is your home.

31:00.068 --> 31:03.572
GHOST VOICE: (distorted)
You die here,
you stay here forever.

31:05.449 --> 31:07.659
(distorted) Honey, are you okay?

31:07.784 --> 31:09.661
GWEN: Wait for us there.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.496
(quickened footsteps)

31:11.496 --> 31:15.167
GWEN: And we'll be
a family again.

31:15.334 --> 31:17.294
We found him. No big deal.

31:17.294 --> 31:19.379
-He's wet.
-Yeah, I can see that.

31:19.588 --> 31:21.340
You know, but otherwise
unharmed.

31:21.340 --> 31:23.050
ANNE: (distorted) Come on,
let's get you home and dry.

31:23.175 --> 31:24.468
You poor thing.
(voices talking over)

31:24.676 --> 31:27.638
BITTNER: (distorted)
Miss Calder!
Wait, wait! Miss Calder!

31:30.265 --> 31:32.392
(elevator door closes)

31:34.728 --> 31:37.189
(scream)
(glass smashes)

31:41.443 --> 31:43.111
(phone ringing)

31:44.112 --> 31:46.114
(beep)
BITTNER:Miss Calder?
Charles Bittner.

31:46.114 --> 31:47.157
Good news.

31:47.157 --> 31:49.243
We'd like you and your
family to come back

31:49.243 --> 31:51.161
and work on that exciting
project.

31:51.745 --> 31:54.540
(light jazz music)
Mr Torres thinks
is a great idea.

31:54.748 --> 31:57.668
Luckily, we've renovation
scheduled
this weekend,

31:57.668 --> 32:01.004
so, you'll have the, er,
the entire ship to yourself.

32:01.713 --> 32:05.133
♪Good times are finally back♪

32:05.634 --> 32:09.179
♪ Here to stay and
that's a fact ♪
(happy chatter)

32:09.596 --> 32:12.307
♪Living free again...♪

32:13.100 --> 32:16.520
♪Good times are finally back♪

32:16.520 --> 32:17.938
(Gwen and David chattering)

32:25.946 --> 32:28.448
I'm on the lookout for
my next big star.

32:28.448 --> 32:31.076
She could be right here,
in this room,

32:31.076 --> 32:33.453
you just never know.

32:36.957 --> 32:39.001
(whispering) You
just never know.

32:41.295 --> 32:42.921
(chair scrapes)

32:43.297 --> 32:44.840
Where are you going?

32:44.840 --> 32:47.342
How's he supposed to notice me
if I'm planted to a chair?

32:47.467 --> 32:49.761
I told you, we don't beg, ever.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.181
Well, I say let the
cards decide.

32:52.181 --> 32:53.724
No, we shouldn't draw attention.

32:54.516 --> 32:56.268
What if somebody else questions
and we've to explains things?

32:56.268 --> 32:57.352
-Things?
-Things.

32:57.352 --> 32:59.188
We were offered tickets
to America
and we took 'em.

32:59.188 --> 33:00.606
What's wrong with that?

33:00.981 --> 33:02.941
They paid me to read
their fortune.

33:03.358 --> 33:05.360
I told them they'd die
if they left London.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.445
Who's to say they wouldn't?

33:06.570 --> 33:08.947
That was wrong.
It's not what the cards said.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.491
We were fine in third class.

33:12.409 --> 33:14.953
We don't belong there
and neither does she.

33:17.206 --> 33:18.165
(sighs)

33:22.085 --> 33:23.462
Hmm-mm.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.923
Now then, put that in your pipe.

33:26.465 --> 33:29.384
(band continues singing)

33:37.935 --> 33:39.144
(slow footsteps)

33:41.897 --> 33:43.273
(glasses clatter)
(room falls silent)

33:45.526 --> 33:46.652
(Jackie breathes heavily)

33:50.364 --> 33:53.075
(band and chatter continue)

33:55.452 --> 33:57.329
COWGIRL:
Have you seen George's new film?

33:57.621 --> 33:59.206
Oh, it's simply divine.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.500
Hepburn lights up every room.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.836
Including the box office.

34:04.002 --> 34:06.463
I don't know how to compare it
to some of his earlier pictures,

34:06.755 --> 34:10.092
probably not as entertaining as
Two Dinosaurs Meet
While Ice Skating.

34:10.717 --> 34:11.969
But it is just magical,
wouldn't you agree?

34:11.969 --> 34:13.512
Excuse me, Sir.

34:13.512 --> 34:14.888
COWGIRL: Now, you may ask,
what is the distinction between

34:14.888 --> 34:16.264
subject matter and style.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.016
-But this is a cinematic...
-I'm a dancer.

34:18.016 --> 34:20.143
-...experiment in style.
-I'd to audition for
your next movie.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.437
What now, my dear?

34:22.437 --> 34:23.522
I'm a dancer.

34:23.522 --> 34:25.607
I'd like to audition for
your next movie.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.693
I'm the star
you've been looking for.

34:30.696 --> 34:32.114
(Viktor clears his throat)

34:32.114 --> 34:35.324
Did your parents not teach you
that it is very rude

34:35.324 --> 34:39.246
to come to a table uninvited?
-Oh, Viktor. Come now.

34:48.213 --> 34:50.090
Good evening, your name please.

34:50.090 --> 34:51.550
Mr and Mrs Howe.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.219
Frightfully sorry I had
to cancel earlier.

34:54.511 --> 34:56.722
My wife is feeling
much better now.

34:57.472 --> 34:59.099
Is there a table still free?

35:02.144 --> 35:03.103
(jazz singing)

35:08.650 --> 35:09.693
What happened?

35:12.696 --> 35:13.655
Oh.

35:19.286 --> 35:20.579
(chair scrapes)

35:20.579 --> 35:23.081
David.

35:23.081 --> 35:24.875
GINGER: He once asked,
can I give him a scoop?

35:25.167 --> 35:27.586
A scoop, I said, of what
ice cream?!

35:27.794 --> 35:28.962
Well, I'm a sherbet...

35:28.962 --> 35:29.922
Excuse me.

35:30.797 --> 35:32.466
Sir, that's my girl
you just spoke to.

35:32.466 --> 35:34.927
She's, er, just a little upset.

35:40.974 --> 35:42.267
(chair scrapes loudly)

35:42.267 --> 35:43.227
Now...

35:44.728 --> 35:46.688
I apologise that she
interrupted you,

35:46.688 --> 35:49.983
but she wants to be in movies
more than anything and, er...

35:50.234 --> 35:51.902
and now she's just
a little upset.

35:51.902 --> 35:53.862
She's talking about
abandoning her dream,

35:53.862 --> 35:55.489
which upset my wife.

35:55.489 --> 35:57.115
Oh, we're also performers.

35:59.159 --> 36:01.036
Now, she's a dancer.
A very good one.

36:01.328 --> 36:02.412
Better than that Ginger Rogers.

36:02.412 --> 36:04.373
-Oh, she is?
-Oh!

36:04.373 --> 36:07.459
(laughs) You'll be doing
me a big favour
if you just reconsider.

36:07.459 --> 36:09.878
You, you see what see can do,
you won't be sorry.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.964
(jazz singing continues
in background)

36:19.555 --> 36:20.514
(Viktor slurps)

36:22.349 --> 36:25.561
(chuckles) Please.

36:26.395 --> 36:27.938
(laughs)

36:40.158 --> 36:41.285
Please.

36:42.703 --> 36:44.580
And who are you?

36:45.330 --> 36:46.957
My thought exactly.

36:47.916 --> 36:49.376

36:52.379 --> 36:54.464
BITTNER: Go home.
We'll reschedule.

36:54.464 --> 36:56.341
ANNE: Why would you
invite us here
and then tell us to go home?

36:56.341 --> 36:57.926
Isn't the book from
your son's perspective?

36:57.926 --> 36:59.178
Er, yeah, but...

36:59.303 --> 37:00.929
BITTNER: Well, so he
should be here.

37:01.096 --> 37:03.223
ANNE: It's empty now.
It's the perfect time to do it.

37:03.348 --> 37:07.352
BITTNER: Oh, we refurbish
all the time.
Yeah, tourism is eating
this ship alive.

37:07.352 --> 37:08.937
People come, they take things.

37:09.188 --> 37:11.440
Souvenirs that cost
us a fortune.

37:12.900 --> 37:14.276
You know the worst offender?

37:14.526 --> 37:16.862
I mean, you'll laugh.
(chuckles)

37:17.029 --> 37:18.071
Mould.

37:18.071 --> 37:19.406
-What, mould?
-Hmm.

37:19.406 --> 37:21.700
Such a tiny nuisance, you know.

37:22.367 --> 37:24.786
We got leaking roofs,
dripping air ducts,

37:24.786 --> 37:28.373
sweating plumbing pipes
and all this...damp.

37:29.249 --> 37:31.418
I mean, you wouldn't think it
when you're up there
in the fresh air.

37:31.418 --> 37:33.170
But below deck
is the perfect breeding ground

37:33.170 --> 37:36.340
for some really...
nasty organisms.

37:37.508 --> 37:41.053
Which might explain
why your son is sick.

37:41.053 --> 37:43.180
Tell me, did Lukas
mention the ship
when you got home?

37:43.180 --> 37:45.432
He said he left his camera
in the pool area.

37:45.432 --> 37:47.392
-Pool?
-His clothes were wet.

37:47.392 --> 37:49.102
No, pockets of stagnant water.

37:49.102 --> 37:50.312
Poor ventilation.

37:50.604 --> 37:51.647
He said the pool.

37:51.647 --> 37:53.982
When we docked in '67,
the boilers came out,

37:53.982 --> 37:55.567
so did the pool above it.

37:55.567 --> 37:58.403
It was a tragedy, really.
She was a real pearl. But...

37:59.446 --> 38:03.158
Look, er, I know this
isn't the same
without Lukas.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.285
So how about when you come back,

38:05.285 --> 38:08.372
I'll give you a deluxe,
all access, tour.

38:08.664 --> 38:10.082
With me as your guide, yeah?

38:10.374 --> 38:12.835
And, er, this is you.

38:14.711 --> 38:18.298
I had to leave my
very sick son...
at home

38:19.174 --> 38:22.928
in order to come here
because he knows this is, um...

38:24.346 --> 38:25.973
a last chance for us.

38:26.890 --> 38:29.685
I even had to call my very
unpleasant mother

38:29.977 --> 38:31.353
to ask her to watch him.

38:31.854 --> 38:35.315
And as you can imagine,
I don't like calling
her for anything.

38:36.650 --> 38:39.069
We are just not leaving here
empty handed...

38:40.445 --> 38:41.655
Captain.

38:43.699 --> 38:47.202
I am not asking you,
I am begging you.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.162
Okay.

38:50.706 --> 38:51.748
Okay!

38:52.958 --> 38:56.795
But, er, anything below M deck
is restricted.

38:57.796 --> 38:59.965
He's not exactly Captain
material,
is he?

39:07.973 --> 39:10.267
If you don't wanna do this,
I understand.

39:12.394 --> 39:15.022

39:41.632 --> 39:43.842

What does that have to
do with anything?

39:43.967 --> 39:45.511
There is a special place in hell

to your father or I, stay here.

Oh, a critic.

Still, it's one thing to have an
opportunity, it's another

And she will.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.288

51:29.548 --> 51:31.675

Where is she?!

(glass crunching)

51:41.226 --> 51:42.728
GWEN: Where is she?

51:45.230 --> 51:46.648
She must've slipped out.

51:46.940 --> 51:49.776
No. I told her to stay here.

51:52.070 --> 51:54.072
-You have to let me inside.
-Out of the question.

51:54.239 --> 51:55.240

(music and dancing continue)

54:43.700 --> 54:46.495
Captain, you're risking
the forward generators

54:46.495 --> 54:48.121
and the safety of
the passengers!

54:49.873 --> 54:50.916
And for what?

54:50.916 --> 54:53.043
For the sake of a title?
It's reckless.

54:53.418 --> 54:55.254
The first-class pool
is above us.

54:55.838 --> 54:57.840
Clear it out, as a precaution.

54:58.423 --> 54:59.675
If that'll make you feel better.

54:59.800 --> 55:00.968
But I'm telling you,

55:01.468 --> 55:05.013
there's nothing we can
throw at this ship
that she cannot survive.

55:08.851 --> 55:10.561
Natural law might disagree.

57:20.107 --> 57:24.027
Kid, you were wonderful.
Just wonderful!

57:25.571 --> 57:28.323
(clears throat)
I am sorry about before.

57:28.323 --> 57:29.283
(chuckles)

57:29.950 --> 57:30.909
You got real talent.

57:31.451 --> 57:32.661
I want to offer you a contract.

57:32.661 --> 57:34.538
I guarantee it'll open
every door in town,

57:34.538 --> 57:36.540
or I'm not Viktor Kershner!

57:38.584 --> 57:40.419
Now, if I could just
speak to your parents,

57:40.419 --> 57:43.213
straighten out that
misunderstanding
from before.

57:46.466 --> 57:49.136
You stay there.
I'll go talk to them.

57:51.471 --> 57:52.764
-(Fred chuckles)
-Thank you!

57:53.056 --> 57:54.433
FRED: Kid, you earned it.

57:54.641 --> 57:56.143
(junior engineer screaming)

57:59.313 --> 58:01.273
Just hold on a little longer.

58:01.273 --> 58:02.649
(junior engineer gasps)

58:03.150 --> 58:04.693
Not my swally!

58:04.693 --> 58:05.652
You'll be fine.

58:33.305 --> 58:34.348
(door closes)

(light switch clicks)

58:35.557 --> 58:36.600

58:38.560 --> 58:39.520
David?

58:44.024 --> 58:45.108
(sighs)

58:45.609 --> 58:48.362
(key slides into lock)
(hatch door creaks open)

58:49.947 --> 58:51.031
David?

58:51.406 --> 58:52.991
(door handle turns)

58:53.825 --> 58:54.785
Is that you?

58:54.993 --> 58:57.162
(door creaks open)

59:03.544 --> 59:04.920
Oh, thank goodness.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.463
Something is very wrong.

59:06.463 --> 59:08.048
I went back and she
wasn't there.

59:08.048 --> 59:09.967
David, I, I didn't
want to tell you

59:09.967 --> 59:11.927
in case you accuse me
of being overly dramatic,

59:11.927 --> 59:14.096
because I know this sounds
like it is...

59:14.096 --> 59:15.639
...but last night I had a dream

59:15.639 --> 59:17.724
there were police waiting for us
at the port

59:17.724 --> 59:20.936
and then a few moments
ago downstairs
I tried to give the
maitre d' a tip,

59:20.936 --> 59:23.105
but when I reached into my bag,
I pulled out this!

59:24.565 --> 59:25.732
(bang)

59:27.192 --> 59:28.902
(threatening music)

59:34.533 --> 59:36.702
-Why do you have that?
-Hmm.

59:36.702 --> 59:37.661
(keys jangle)

59:38.120 --> 59:39.538
(slow cello music)

59:42.165 --> 59:44.334
(David growls)

59:46.128 --> 59:47.087
I...

59:47.880 --> 59:50.549
I'm going to go upstairs
and try and find...

59:52.467 --> 59:53.594
...Cassandra.

59:55.137 --> 59:56.638
Perhaps she's waiting
in the playroom.

59:57.181 --> 59:58.140
DAVID: Stay.

01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:06.940
(creaking)

01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:12.863

01:00:30.047 --> 01:00:31.340
(rubbing sound)

01:00:42.601 --> 01:00:44.520
Somebody oughta tell them
to keep it down.

01:00:48.732 --> 01:00:50.025
(threatening music)

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.071
(door opens)
(chain jangles)

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:57.199
Can you please keep it down?

01:00:58.742 --> 01:01:01.078
Or I'll call security.

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:06.458

DAVID: He's with the ship now.

01:02:52.064 --> 01:02:53.232
What does that mean?

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.318
Show me my husband!

01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.948

01:03:15.546 --> 01:03:17.214
DAVID: Now take the card.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:22.094
(crying) Just tell me.

01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:24.680
DAVID: The answer
is on the card.

01:03:30.853 --> 01:03:31.895
Please.

01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:35.899
DAVID: Step in and take it.

01:03:38.527 --> 01:03:39.486
(sobbing)

01:03:43.991 --> 01:03:45.909
What did you do to my husband?

01:03:47.035 --> 01:03:50.122
DAVID: (scoffs) Your husband,
your husband?

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:32.487
Join our resident guides
as they lead you into the depths

01:08:32.487 --> 01:08:36.825
of the RMS Queen Mary
in an effort to connect
with spirits

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:39.286
who still call the ship home.

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:44.416
Stops include the
isolation ward,
door number 13,

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:46.042
the boiler room,

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:50.005
and the infamous B-474
state room.

01:08:50.421 --> 01:08:54.009
That's Ghosts and Legends
departing soon.

01:08:54.426 --> 01:08:56.595
(high tempo jazz music)

01:08:58.138 --> 01:08:59.765
(phone rings)

01:09:01.850 --> 01:09:04.228
TORRES:Bittner.
Yeah?

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.354
Will you turn it down?

01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:12.611
(music stops)

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:17.698
It's Torres.

01:09:18.033 --> 01:09:20.202
Yeah?
You're closed for business?

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:21.578
Yeah.

01:09:21.578 --> 01:09:23.330
Management is concerned.

01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:25.040
Yeah, we're, er...

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:27.709
we're renovating.

01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:29.795
(chuckles) Must be
a pretty big job?

01:09:30.087 --> 01:09:33.048
Well, it's an emergency.
It's just a couple of days.

01:09:34.841 --> 01:09:37.928
We've creditors crawling
up our ass
threatening to call in loans.

01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:40.013
I mean, do we look
like Disney Land?

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:45.519
Look, I've been
doing this a long
time, Mr Torres,

01:09:46.019 --> 01:09:49.314
and I'm telling you,
it's better to cut
a problem off at the root.

01:09:49.982 --> 01:09:51.358
What problem?

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:57.114
Bittner, are you there?

01:09:57.281 --> 01:09:58.448
(Bittner sighs)

01:09:59.658 --> 01:10:00.868
Bittner!

01:10:01.076 --> 01:10:04.705
One of our guests
stole a vessel.

01:10:05.163 --> 01:10:06.373
A lifeboat?

01:10:06.832 --> 01:10:08.208
Er, no.

01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:10.460
Oh?

01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:14.214
A little girl, er,
took one home.

01:10:14.923 --> 01:10:18.051
I called the parents,
requested they return it,

01:10:18.468 --> 01:10:20.387
but they fed me some bullshit.

01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:22.598
Said she wasn't coming back,

01:10:22.598 --> 01:10:25.893
so I need time to find out
what they know and fix it.

01:10:26.018 --> 01:10:29.229
Soon as I'm done,
doors will open.

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.523
Get rid of them.

01:10:32.274 --> 01:10:34.568
I don't think you understand.

01:10:34.568 --> 01:10:36.486
No, no. We agreed.

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:41.408
You sell The Queen
Mary experience,
tours, merchandise,
churro and whatnot,

01:10:41.533 --> 01:10:43.744
and we ignore whatever
goes on there.

01:10:43.744 --> 01:10:45.996
But if you go and make
an even bigger mess,

01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:47.456
that's a problem.

01:10:47.456 --> 01:10:49.625
Call me tomorrow
when doors are open.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:51.168
-And Bittner?
-Yeah?

01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:53.545
You're a security guard.
Don't fucking...

01:10:53.545 --> 01:10:55.672
(phone hangs up)
(upbeat jazz music continues)

01:11:02.513 --> 01:11:04.264
(thunder rumbles)

01:11:07.601 --> 01:11:09.061
(whiskey sloshes)

01:11:09.686 --> 01:11:11.438
Hey, Jesus!
(Anne spits)

01:11:11.438 --> 01:11:13.357
I'll make you a Manhattan later
if you want.

01:11:13.649 --> 01:11:15.526
I think it was the
girl's mother.

01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:17.486
-Ow!
-Yeah, I believe you.

01:11:19.738 --> 01:11:22.241
That wasn't your son
you left with...

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.701
Our son.

01:11:32.751 --> 01:11:37.965
I know you only stayed
for Lukas,
all these years.

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:39.007
I know that.
(Anne inhales)

01:11:39.007 --> 01:11:40.342
Wait, wait, please.

01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:42.636
But, um...

01:11:45.931 --> 01:11:47.307
what happens if he is here?

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.938
(whispers) Then I'll stay.

01:11:57.025 --> 01:11:58.110
(softly) Okay.

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:04.199
It's just that I don't know
where to find the pool.

01:12:06.994 --> 01:12:07.953
I do.

01:12:09.997 --> 01:12:11.373
I think we're done here.

01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:14.543
(light switch clicks)

01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:17.963
(telephone ringing)

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:28.599
Anne, Captain Bittner here.

01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:30.642
(exhales) Oh, hello.

01:12:31.018 --> 01:12:33.020
I'm sorry, the power is down.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.230
This whole place is a death trap
when it rains.

01:12:35.230 --> 01:12:36.273
Look, I called maintenance,

01:12:36.273 --> 01:12:38.150
but they said they won't be here
until tomorrow.

01:12:38.150 --> 01:12:39.484
I mean, "Tomorrow?" I said.

01:12:39.484 --> 01:12:41.570
"We've guests working on
a special project."

01:12:41.695 --> 01:12:45.616
They apologised and all,
but tomorrow's the
best they can do.

01:12:45.616 --> 01:12:46.700
We brought torches.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:47.826
Yeah, if it was up to me,

01:12:47.826 --> 01:12:49.453
I wouldn't care
if you looked around,

01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.205
but it's an insurance
risk, you know.

01:12:51.205 --> 01:12:53.457
Those guys, they're
a pain in the ass,
you understand?

01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:54.833
ANNE: We'll be careful.

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:56.543
Yeah, no doubt.
Still, we shouldn't
take any risks.

01:12:56.543 --> 01:12:58.128
Let's reschedule, I insist.

01:12:58.253 --> 01:13:00.506
Pour yourself a drink,
I'll come get you.

01:13:00.881 --> 01:13:02.883
We'll walk to your cabin,
collect your stuff.

01:13:03.342 --> 01:13:06.345
And, er, I can tell
you about the time
Walt Disney and I smoked cigars

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:08.931
in the bar until the
wee hours. Huh?

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:12.184
ANNE: Okay, Captain. (sighs)

01:13:12.726 --> 01:13:14.603
(phone rings off)
We gotta go.

01:13:14.603 --> 01:13:15.729
You know what?

01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:17.856
Think I will have that drink.

01:13:18.899 --> 01:13:21.068
(smashing, screaming)

01:13:21.068 --> 01:13:22.694
(high tempo music)

01:13:24.321 --> 01:13:25.572
Hell are you going?

01:13:25.572 --> 01:13:26.698
(drawer opens)

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:29.076
(gun cocks)

01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:30.369
(bullets clang)

01:13:30.786 --> 01:13:32.913
(barrel spins)
(junior engineer screaming)

01:13:34.456 --> 01:13:35.832
(crewmen chattering)

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:40.212
CREWMAN: Go! Clear!

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:41.672
-JUNIOR ENGINEER: My face!
-CREWMAN: Move!

01:13:41.672 --> 01:13:43.048
-JUNIOR ENGINEER: My face!
-Wait!

01:13:43.173 --> 01:13:44.758
CREWMAN: Make way
for the Captain!

01:13:46.093 --> 01:13:47.845
(junior engineer whimpers)
CARRADINE: Give it here.

01:13:50.722 --> 01:13:53.141
Not...my...swally!

01:13:53.141 --> 01:13:54.476
CARRADINE: Easy, easy!

01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:59.439
Go. Go!

01:14:12.077 --> 01:14:13.704
Oh God, oh God.

01:14:14.288 --> 01:14:15.664
(tense music)

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.751
(machine whirring)

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.927
(steam blows)

01:14:29.303 --> 01:14:30.387
Captain.
(Carradine gasps)

01:14:30.387 --> 01:14:31.847
(hip flask clangs)
Gibson! Bloody hell.

01:14:36.143 --> 01:14:38.937
Forward generator burned out.
All the flood doors are closing.

01:14:39.354 --> 01:14:40.814
Shall we contact New York?

01:14:40.814 --> 01:14:42.399
The navy? I mean,
maybe they have a craft
in the area.

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:44.151
No, no. Just,
just...(chuckles)...

01:14:44.151 --> 01:14:46.820
just tell them
it's part of tonight's
entertainment.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:48.322
Sir?

01:14:48.572 --> 01:14:50.032
-Why aren't you upstairs?
-Well, I was.

01:14:50.032 --> 01:14:51.992
But an incident occurred
with one of the passengers.

01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:54.620
-Well, take care of it.
-There's been a murder.

01:14:54.786 --> 01:14:56.496
(dramatic music)

01:15:03.128 --> 01:15:05.088
(quickened footsteps)

01:15:08.008 --> 01:15:09.176
David Ratch.

01:15:09.176 --> 01:15:11.553
Travelling third class
with his family.

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:14.890
Appears Mr Ratch lost his senses
some time after dinner.

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.434
Found him covered in
his wife's blood
trying to launch a life vessel.

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:19.394
Took three men to restrain him.

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:20.771
He's in the infirmary now.

01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:22.773
Bloody hell,
how did they get down here?

01:15:22.773 --> 01:15:24.483
DRUNK GUEST: Captain!
Why's she so slow this
evening, huh?!

01:15:24.483 --> 01:15:26.109
Party's upstairs, gentlemen.

01:15:26.109 --> 01:15:27.861
-DRUNK GUEST: Are we sinking?!
-Alright, alright. That'll do.

01:15:27.861 --> 01:15:30.781
The fastest ship, my
arse. (laughing)

01:15:32.115 --> 01:15:33.283
CARRADINE: Where is Mrs Ratch?

01:15:33.283 --> 01:15:34.952
Cabin B-474.

01:15:34.952 --> 01:15:37.079
Apparently, he did
it with an axe.
Made a frightful mess.

01:15:37.204 --> 01:15:39.540
They have a young daughter.
Our people are trying
to locate her.

01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:41.959
She was last seen leaving
the grand salon by herself,

01:15:41.959 --> 01:15:43.418
approximately eight thirty.

01:15:43.418 --> 01:15:45.212
(people chattering)

01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:51.426
GUEST: How dare you make a joke
about my wife?!

01:15:51.426 --> 01:15:52.469
CLOWN: I wasn't...
(glass smashes)

01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:53.679
(guests gasp)

01:15:54.805 --> 01:15:56.431
Sir, respectfully,
why are we here

01:15:56.431 --> 01:15:57.891
and not at the scene
or on the bridge?

01:15:58.183 --> 01:15:59.726
I needed to see for myself.

01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:02.354
Clock stopped at seven.

01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:05.065
Same time you reported
the accident downstairs.

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.192
The prisoner say anything?

01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:08.485
Well, like what?

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.612
Other than the obvious crazy?

01:16:11.113 --> 01:16:13.323
Was there anything
that stood out?

01:16:13.615 --> 01:16:15.450
Well apparently, his
friends call him
Clarky.

01:16:15.784 --> 01:16:17.953
Thought it was a bit odd
for someone with the
surname Ratch.

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.498
He then used some rather
choice words
to indicate how the
officer could

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:23.834
use a 'so-and-so' and insert it.

01:16:24.418 --> 01:16:25.961
-A cigarette?
-(chuckles) No.

01:16:27.045 --> 01:16:28.881
-Have you a cigarette, Gibson?
-Oh.

01:16:30.549 --> 01:16:32.134
(tinkling music)

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.261
It must be time to send an SOS.

01:16:36.930 --> 01:16:38.682
Have you witnessed
a ship go down?

01:16:40.601 --> 01:16:41.560
No.

01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.687
I have.

01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:46.982
My father did everything
he could.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.485
Gave the order within
plenty of time.

01:16:52.529 --> 01:16:53.906
People get scared.

01:16:55.365 --> 01:16:58.452
They panic...and
fight like rats.

01:16:59.661 --> 01:17:01.705
I won't let that happen
on this ship.

01:17:02.372 --> 01:17:04.082
Not while we can still save her.

01:17:04.708 --> 01:17:06.168
Well, shall I report
to the bridge and...

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.795
coordinate our resources
from there?

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:10.923
(scoffs)

01:17:11.757 --> 01:17:12.966
You don't understand.

01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.386
Our only concern now

01:17:17.554 --> 01:17:18.972
is Mr Ratch.

01:17:22.059 --> 01:17:23.685
(lilting piano music)

01:17:42.496 --> 01:17:43.789
(Anne breathes heavily)

01:17:51.588 --> 01:17:53.382
LADY IN WHITE:
Frightfully sorry to bother you.

01:17:54.508 --> 01:17:56.927
But I'm supposed to
meet my husband in New York.

01:17:57.177 --> 01:17:59.680
And the captain said
I can't disembark.

01:18:01.056 --> 01:18:04.977
If you see my husband,
can you send him a message?

01:18:05.853 --> 01:18:08.021
(cries) I need...
(head clangs on piano keys)

01:18:08.021 --> 01:18:09.356
Oh!

01:18:12.609 --> 01:18:14.319
(piano music continues)
...to leave...

01:18:14.319 --> 01:18:15.821
(head clangs on piano keys)

01:18:15.946 --> 01:18:17.573
...this...
(head clanging on piano keys)

01:18:17.698 --> 01:18:20.117
...ship...
(head bashing piano)

01:18:21.076 --> 01:18:23.704
I need to leave this ship,
I need to leave this ship!

01:18:23.704 --> 01:18:28.125
(shouts) I need to
leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:33.881
I need to leave this ship!
I need to leave this ship!

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:37.342
I need to leave this...!

01:18:37.342 --> 01:18:39.469
(door beeps, opens)

01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:44.725
(tense music)

01:18:45.225 --> 01:18:47.102
(shoes squeaking)

01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:08.832
(wind whistling)

01:19:09.082 --> 01:19:11.376
PATRICK: The pool.
It's below M deck.

01:19:13.003 --> 01:19:15.589
Bittner, you sneaky
little prick.

01:19:15.964 --> 01:19:17.591
(banging on wall)

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:22.930
(softly) Shit.

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:26.058
It's all wet. Even the scanner.

01:19:26.225 --> 01:19:28.143
This'll need time to dry.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.323
Friend of Bittner's, you think?

01:19:44.451 --> 01:19:45.661
(clears throat)

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:53.210
You know, I thought
if we did this project together,

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:56.129
you and Lukas would come home
and we'd be...

01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:59.258
a...a kind of family again.

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:02.177
But honestly, the last
thing I expected

01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:06.098
was to get your answer
before we even started.

01:20:06.640 --> 01:20:08.225
So, I, I guess...

01:20:10.018 --> 01:20:11.770
how come I wasn't enough?

01:20:12.896 --> 01:20:13.856
ANNE: Oh no.

01:20:14.565 --> 01:20:16.149
No, no, that's not what it is.

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:18.151
I just don't believe
in marriage.

01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:20.028
I failed once.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.492
(softly) I still want to escape.

01:20:26.410 --> 01:20:29.872
It's just that the urge
to be with Lukas is stronger.

01:20:36.712 --> 01:20:38.338
You know, if you stay here,

01:20:39.923 --> 01:20:42.593
you'll get trapped
like that shrieking woman.

01:20:42.718 --> 01:20:44.219
(ominous music)

01:20:45.554 --> 01:20:49.641
You'll end up as a footnote
in one of Bittner's
haunted tours.

01:20:49.641 --> 01:20:52.227
A historical curiosity,
nothing more.

01:20:57.357 --> 01:20:58.317
Patrick.

01:20:59.109 --> 01:21:00.068
Yeah?

01:21:00.736 --> 01:21:03.030
I can't leave my son alone here.

01:21:08.619 --> 01:21:09.745
Fine.

01:21:10.204 --> 01:21:12.998
We can be the dead family
still walking the deck.

01:21:16.919 --> 01:21:18.795
(smashing)
(high tempo music)

01:21:28.555 --> 01:21:30.849
(Bittner breathing heavily)

01:21:37.731 --> 01:21:39.107
(smashing continues)

01:21:47.574 --> 01:21:50.202
(vomits)
(smashing)

01:21:59.002 --> 01:22:02.214
(David breathes heavily)

01:22:07.636 --> 01:22:09.429
Ugh, that smell.

01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.394
(dramatic music crescendo)

01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:24.653
(flare sizzles)

01:22:28.699 --> 01:22:30.409
(dead bolt slides closed)

01:22:35.414 --> 01:22:39.126
(Jackie screaming, sobbing)

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.840
(kicks door open)

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:48.135
(siren blaring in
the background)

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:51.346
(heavy breathing)

01:22:58.979 --> 01:23:00.355
(distant banging)

01:23:02.691 --> 01:23:04.526
(tense music)

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:38.393
(high tempo music)

01:23:49.029 --> 01:23:51.114
Motherfuckers!

01:23:55.327 --> 01:23:57.412
(echoing footsteps)

01:23:59.915 --> 01:24:01.959
(ominous music)

01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:20.853
(water dripping)

01:24:24.481 --> 01:24:27.609
(flashback sounds)

01:24:30.779 --> 01:24:31.905
Look.

01:24:33.532 --> 01:24:35.450
He's still here, Patrick.

01:24:36.827 --> 01:24:38.704
(Anne sobs)

01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:54.970
(doors open)

01:25:01.768 --> 01:25:07.232
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.
(Jackie wheezing)

01:25:14.364 --> 01:25:16.408
(Jackie exhales her
final breath)

01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:18.243
(soft violin music)

01:25:21.788 --> 01:25:22.956
(door opens)

01:25:23.207 --> 01:25:24.666
(siren blares in background)

01:25:40.849 --> 01:25:42.267
Oh, Christ.

01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:45.103
(David yells)
(fighting, slashing, spurting)

01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.566
GIBSON: Send the distress code.

01:25:49.566 --> 01:25:52.444
CARRADINE: It won't
make a difference,
don't you see?

01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:56.281
The man roaming freely
is why the ship is faltering.

01:25:57.366 --> 01:25:58.534
(beeping)

01:25:58.867 --> 01:26:00.869
(door creaks open)

01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:07.835
Hello?

01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:10.963
Miss Calder?

01:26:15.425 --> 01:26:17.594
(water running)

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.640
Are you alright in there?

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.058
(door creaks open)

01:26:24.601 --> 01:26:27.145
(gunfire)

01:26:27.271 --> 01:26:28.355
(door kicks open)

01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:33.360
(dramatic music)

01:26:46.498 --> 01:26:48.333
(homeless man gasping)

01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:51.295
Oh, fuck!

01:26:51.295 --> 01:26:52.921
(curtain door swishes)
(gunfire)

01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:54.006
(curtain hooks snap)

01:26:54.006 --> 01:26:55.048
(camera snaps open)

01:26:58.302 --> 01:27:00.721
PATRICK: Wow, he used
the whole roll.

01:27:01.096 --> 01:27:02.222
Be careful.

01:27:12.733 --> 01:27:14.735
PATRICK: I need to know
what Bittner's hiding.

01:27:15.444 --> 01:27:18.405
(whirring, static)

01:27:20.866 --> 01:27:22.326
ANNE: Is that it?

01:27:23.535 --> 01:27:24.703
Damn.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.830
I've never seen a doorway to...

01:27:27.956 --> 01:27:29.041
...fuck knows.

01:27:33.795 --> 01:27:34.838
Anything?

01:27:39.301 --> 01:27:42.387
Is that a...child?

01:27:44.473 --> 01:27:45.557
No.

01:27:47.184 --> 01:27:49.520
No, judging by the size,
I'd say an adult.

01:27:50.646 --> 01:27:51.980
And it's in the structure,

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.774
so probably from the time
the ship was built.

01:27:54.191 --> 01:27:56.485
Also, there's no way
they could put the metal
poles in there

01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:58.362
after pouring the concrete.
Which...

01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:01.365
...which tells me the workers
knew about it.

01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:05.202
Or they did it.
(tense music)

01:28:05.327 --> 01:28:10.958
CARRADINE: After Wall
Street tumbled in
'29, Clydebank shipyard
closed its doors.

01:28:12.209 --> 01:28:15.420
While this vessel was
just bare bones.

01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:21.134
The ship spent three long years
overlooking that town.

01:28:21.134 --> 01:28:22.177
Like a coffin.

01:28:22.845 --> 01:28:24.388
As if they needed reminding

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:27.933
what would happen if her future
couldn't be secured.

01:28:29.643 --> 01:28:31.728
Then with the nation's
pride at stake,

01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:35.315
the British Government
stepped in
with a financial commitment,

01:28:35.315 --> 01:28:36.608
to guarantee completion.

01:28:38.193 --> 01:28:40.946
With Clydebank's
future at stake,

01:28:41.947 --> 01:28:43.365
the workers stepped in.

01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:46.159
To guarantee her success.

01:28:47.619 --> 01:28:49.580
And that of future generations.

01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:51.748
(crowds shouting)

01:28:52.165 --> 01:28:54.418
Crime locks many doors.

01:28:57.796 --> 01:28:59.173
But for one prisoner,

01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:02.050
it required...

01:29:03.927 --> 01:29:05.179
sacrifice.

01:29:05.179 --> 01:29:07.556
PATRICK: Foundation sacrifice,
to be exact.

01:29:08.849 --> 01:29:11.226
According to an old engineering
tradition,

01:29:11.393 --> 01:29:13.061
to guarantee structural
integrity,

01:29:13.061 --> 01:29:15.606
one ought to bury a human
inside of the walls.

01:29:15.856 --> 01:29:17.900
And the more pain he suffers,

01:29:20.110 --> 01:29:21.695
the greater the bind...

01:29:23.155 --> 01:29:24.740
...between his spirit...

01:29:25.616 --> 01:29:26.825
and the ship.

01:29:27.534 --> 01:29:30.120
Until both are inseparable.

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:39.129
The workers selected
their victim,
Edward Clark.

01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:41.590
Or Clarky as he was
known to them.

01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:46.720
A riveter and former inmate,
rumoured to have murdered.

01:29:47.638 --> 01:29:51.433
They inflicted on him
the most miserable of ends.

01:29:51.683 --> 01:29:53.602
(burning, screaming)

01:29:53.602 --> 01:29:55.604
His sacrifice protected them.

01:29:55.604 --> 01:29:57.314
(hammering, screaming)

01:29:57.314 --> 01:29:58.732
(choral music)

01:30:04.863 --> 01:30:07.741
Gave them the success
and peace of mind

01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:09.785
they so badly craved.

01:30:14.039 --> 01:30:15.499
ANNE: That's a real thing?

01:30:15.707 --> 01:30:17.251
What, foundation sacrifice?

01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:19.336
Yeah.

01:30:19.336 --> 01:30:21.588
Well, it's not exactly
on the curriculum at university,

01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:23.048
but yeah, sure.

01:30:23.632 --> 01:30:25.676
From time-to-time cases
have occurred.

01:30:25.968 --> 01:30:27.427
I mean, it's an open secret.

01:30:27.594 --> 01:30:29.972
Even kids' rhymes are about it.

01:30:30.138 --> 01:30:32.266
London Bridge keeps
falling down until...

01:30:32.266 --> 01:30:34.810
ANNE: Until they lock
a man inside.
(distant thunder)

01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:37.563
PATRICK: Yeah.
Folklore based on
a grain of truth.

01:30:38.605 --> 01:30:40.274
My God, that is barbaric.

01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:42.985
And you actually believe
we're unsinkable?!

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.115
PATRICK: Might explain
how the ship
survived a World War

01:30:48.907 --> 01:30:51.326
a dozen botched face lifts,

01:30:51.952 --> 01:30:53.120
a rogue wave.

01:30:55.330 --> 01:31:00.794
rTo reinstate the ship's power,
we must reinstate Mr Clark,

01:31:01.503 --> 01:31:04.882
and kill whatever
flesh he is in.

01:31:04.882 --> 01:31:06.258
(music crescendo)

01:31:09.595 --> 01:31:11.597
(siren continues
in the distance)

01:31:18.312 --> 01:31:19.605
Should we fail...

01:31:21.440 --> 01:31:24.026
...your question as to whether
this ship is unsinkable...

01:31:24.526 --> 01:31:25.527
(clanging)

01:31:26.904 --> 01:31:29.281
...will most certainly
be answered.

01:31:30.532 --> 01:31:31.867
(dramatic music)

01:31:33.243 --> 01:31:34.453
(gasps)

01:31:35.204 --> 01:31:36.163
Oh, my God!

01:31:37.331 --> 01:31:39.583
Oh, my fucking God.

01:31:41.877 --> 01:31:44.046
Shit!
(running footsteps)

01:31:45.088 --> 01:31:46.507
(ghostly sounds)

01:31:47.466 --> 01:31:48.592
Lukas?!

01:31:48.592 --> 01:31:49.635
Patrick!
(clicking)

01:31:49.635 --> 01:31:50.719
I see him.

01:31:50.719 --> 01:31:52.471
-Baby, come back!
-Wait!

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:54.765
(water dripping)
(horrifying music)

01:31:57.309 --> 01:31:58.977
(static interference)

01:32:02.606 --> 01:32:03.815
(banging)

01:32:08.445 --> 01:32:09.530
PATRICK: Anne!

01:32:12.866 --> 01:32:14.409
(breathing heavily)

01:32:19.289 --> 01:32:21.959
(radio bleeps)
Anne? Are you there?

01:32:22.167 --> 01:32:23.377
(Anne gasping)

01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:24.962
(high tempo music)

01:32:32.135 --> 01:32:35.472
ANNE: Patrick, come in! Patrick.

01:32:35.472 --> 01:32:36.431
Yeah, I'm here.

01:32:39.268 --> 01:32:41.854
I followed Lukas to an elevator,
but he's gone.

01:32:42.354 --> 01:32:43.397
Where are you?

01:32:44.398 --> 01:32:45.357
(sighs)

01:32:45.607 --> 01:32:48.944
I don't know, er,
cabin numbers are E-100s.

01:32:49.111 --> 01:32:50.362
PATRICK: (distorted)
Okay, stay where you are...

01:32:51.113 --> 01:32:52.239
(tense music)

01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:07.212
(clanging, ping)

01:33:18.098 --> 01:33:23.437
(eerie music)
(ghostly voices)

01:33:38.118 --> 01:33:40.037
(clanging, hammering)

01:33:49.129 --> 01:33:50.881
(fast footsteps)

01:33:51.298 --> 01:33:52.799
(high tempo music)

01:33:54.510 --> 01:33:56.261
(door opens)
(siren blares)

01:34:03.143 --> 01:34:04.937
CARRADINE: Clear the
way, coming through!

01:34:05.687 --> 01:34:06.897
Keep moving, upstairs.

01:34:06.897 --> 01:34:08.273
And follow the safety orders.

01:34:13.695 --> 01:34:14.863
Where is it?

01:34:15.739 --> 01:34:17.950
(door unlocks, opens)

01:34:28.836 --> 01:34:29.837
(rifle opens)

01:34:37.886 --> 01:34:39.054
Come on!

01:34:41.014 --> 01:34:42.224
(rifle cocks)

01:34:45.185 --> 01:34:46.270
Keep moving!

01:34:46.395 --> 01:34:48.063
Out of the way! Coming through!

01:34:52.067 --> 01:34:53.610
(ghostly shouting)

01:34:53.610 --> 01:34:54.778
(tense music)

01:34:57.865 --> 01:34:59.658
(creaking)

01:35:17.467 --> 01:35:19.887
WOMAN: You're not from
here, are you?
(doors opening)

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:26.560
I'm sorry, excuse
my impertinence.

01:35:27.895 --> 01:35:29.354
-LUKAS: Mum?
-WOMAN: Stay with us, please.

01:35:29.479 --> 01:35:30.522
ANNE: Lukas?
(ghostly chatter)

01:35:30.522 --> 01:35:31.899
WOMAN: If you wish to stay,

01:35:32.107 --> 01:35:34.109
y- y- you could take my place!

01:35:34.109 --> 01:35:36.403
(laughs) I really don't mind!

01:35:36.904 --> 01:35:39.823
MAN: It's wonderful,
wonderful fun!

01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.658
WOMAN: And I could leave...

01:35:42.618 --> 01:35:44.661
(distorted) just for
a little while.

01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:46.330
WOMAN: You don't understand!

01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:47.748
I've been here for so long!

01:35:47.748 --> 01:35:49.374
WOMAN: I promise,
I'll come back.

01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:50.876
None of this is real.

01:35:51.668 --> 01:35:53.879
-None of this is real.
-MAN: need your body!

01:35:53.879 --> 01:35:55.422
MAN: But I need you more!

01:35:55.839 --> 01:35:57.591
WOMAN: (angry)
Why should you go and not me?!

01:35:57.591 --> 01:35:59.718
MAN: Fuck me.
People are waiting for me!

01:35:59.968 --> 01:36:02.179
WOMAN: Please! I'm begging you!

01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:03.347
Lukas!

01:36:03.347 --> 01:36:04.473
WOMAN: Where are you?!

01:36:06.642 --> 01:36:08.268
MAN: Give me your body!

01:36:08.268 --> 01:36:10.020
(Anne breathes heavily)
(ghostly screaming continues)

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:12.314
MAN: I must get off
of this boat!

01:36:14.691 --> 01:36:15.984
Stop!

01:36:16.902 --> 01:36:18.403
Where are you?

01:36:22.908 --> 01:36:24.993
I thought you'd gone home.

01:36:28.455 --> 01:36:29.540
Er...

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.959
yeah, we got lost
on the way out.

01:36:36.630 --> 01:36:38.257
Have you seen Anne anywhere?

01:36:38.966 --> 01:36:40.092
No.

01:36:45.013 --> 01:36:46.056
Who's that?

01:36:46.348 --> 01:36:47.683
That's nobody.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:50.894
(Patrick breathes heavily)

01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:51.854
You sure?

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:53.438
Yeah.

01:36:56.775 --> 01:36:58.235
So, so that...

01:36:58.652 --> 01:37:00.362
that's not her on the trolley?

01:37:01.196 --> 01:37:02.281
Oh, him?

01:37:03.407 --> 01:37:05.200
No, it's just, er...

01:37:07.119 --> 01:37:11.790
just some vagrant I caught,
er, sneaking around.

01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:17.754
Okay.

01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:20.424
Okay.

01:37:20.424 --> 01:37:23.051
Er, we, we found the
swimming pool,
by the way.

01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:25.554
You're right, she's,
she's a, she's a pearl.

01:37:26.221 --> 01:37:29.558
And the, er, little brat
who absconded in your
son's place?

01:37:29.558 --> 01:37:31.018
She told us everything.

01:37:33.645 --> 01:37:35.814
Now, I was hoping you'd, er,
return with her,

01:37:35.814 --> 01:37:39.276
so I could give you back
your son.

01:37:39.693 --> 01:37:41.904
(Patrick coughs, sniffs)

01:37:42.404 --> 01:37:43.822
We left instructions.

01:37:43.864 --> 01:37:45.908
If we don't walk out
of here tomorrow,
call the cops.

01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:48.243
Tell them everything. Okay?

01:37:48.493 --> 01:37:53.707
So even if that was true,
who'd believe her stories?

01:37:53.832 --> 01:37:58.629
Well, actually,
a lot of people would.

01:37:59.755 --> 01:38:02.549
Whatever secrets you've kept
hidden down here,

01:38:02.549 --> 01:38:03.759
Lukas saw.

01:38:04.134 --> 01:38:05.427
Okay, he saw them.

01:38:07.763 --> 01:38:08.889
Give that to me.

01:38:09.014 --> 01:38:10.390
No. No, no, no.

01:38:10.682 --> 01:38:13.852
Not until we're safely
off the ship.

01:38:14.937 --> 01:38:16.230
(high tempo music)
(gun cocks)

01:38:16.230 --> 01:38:18.273
(gunshot)
(Patrick groans)

01:38:18.774 --> 01:38:20.984
(door opens, closes)

01:38:23.904 --> 01:38:25.239
(people screaming)

01:38:25.239 --> 01:38:27.866
Move, move, move!
Where's that boy?

01:38:31.662 --> 01:38:32.996
Clarky!

01:38:33.997 --> 01:38:35.165
(siren wails)

01:38:39.837 --> 01:38:41.129
(tannoy chimes)

01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:45.259
As we approach
the next stop of our tour,

01:38:45.384 --> 01:38:47.719
we are reminded in these
hallowed halls

01:38:47.719 --> 01:38:51.056
of how insignificant
we really are.
(breathes heavily)

01:38:51.056 --> 01:38:53.809
When even a ship as hardy
as the Queen Mary

01:38:53.809 --> 01:38:55.769
could be brought to her knees.

01:38:56.186 --> 01:39:00.148
The year 1942,
she was en route to Scotland

01:39:00.148 --> 01:39:03.610
with ten thousand, three hundred
and ninety-eight soldiers,

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:06.530
and nine hundred and fifty
crew on board.

01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:10.868
Duly recorded on the ship's log
is the date and time,

01:39:11.118 --> 01:39:14.413
the course, the destination,
weather conditions,

01:39:14.913 --> 01:39:16.331
temperature,
(door opens)

01:39:16.331 --> 01:39:18.542
longitude and latitude.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.130
But what is never recorded
is the fear that washes
over a deck

01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:25.424
like fog and ocean spray,

01:39:25.424 --> 01:39:28.468
as a ninety foot rogue
wave appears.

01:39:28.594 --> 01:39:32.347
Yes, the RMS Queen Mary
is a frightened ship,

01:39:32.347 --> 01:39:36.810
and she carries with her
a premonition...of death.

01:39:38.770 --> 01:39:40.105
(tense music)

01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:41.899
(siren blares)

01:39:42.107 --> 01:39:43.525
(people shouting, screaming)

01:39:54.077 --> 01:39:55.829
(crockery smashing)

01:40:00.584 --> 01:40:02.794
(people screaming)

01:40:06.089 --> 01:40:07.758
(creaking)

01:40:23.106 --> 01:40:25.067
(siren fades)
(Anne groaning)

01:40:29.655 --> 01:40:32.574
ANNE: Lukas. Oh, Lukas, baby.

01:40:33.825 --> 01:40:34.910
Is that you?

01:40:36.954 --> 01:40:37.996
Is that you?

01:40:37.996 --> 01:40:40.290
(Lukas breathes heavily)

01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:45.337
What happened to Jackie,
Mommy?

01:40:49.216 --> 01:40:50.926
(Anne groaning)

01:41:00.686 --> 01:41:01.687
Where are you?

01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:03.146
Anne, please come in.

01:41:03.146 --> 01:41:04.481
(clanging)
Fuck.

01:41:10.612 --> 01:41:11.822
Oh.

01:41:14.867 --> 01:41:15.826
(water dripping)

01:41:16.827 --> 01:41:18.537
(men talking)

01:41:19.246 --> 01:41:20.247
PATRICK: Lukas?

01:41:21.999 --> 01:41:23.041
Where are you?

01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:33.343
(soldier shouting)

01:41:34.636 --> 01:41:37.097
(hatch door closes)
(siren blares)

01:41:37.097 --> 01:41:38.932
(orchestral music)
(people screaming)

01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:47.065
Keep moving and stay calm.

01:41:47.399 --> 01:41:49.276
It's all part of the show!

01:41:49.276 --> 01:41:51.028
(gunfire, guests screaming)

01:41:51.778 --> 01:41:52.738
MAN: Move!

01:41:54.406 --> 01:41:56.158
Move, move, move!

01:41:56.158 --> 01:41:58.535
(clanging, creaking)

01:42:00.871 --> 01:42:02.206
(gunfire)

01:42:02.497 --> 01:42:03.916
CARRADINE: Don't let
him off the ship!

01:42:05.751 --> 01:42:07.002
(David yells)

01:42:08.003 --> 01:42:09.213
CARRADINE: Reverse the winch.

01:42:11.882 --> 01:42:15.010
No, lower it! Lower it!

01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:16.220
(tense music)

01:42:27.564 --> 01:42:30.692
LUKAS: Mom, why can't I move on?

01:42:31.860 --> 01:42:33.320
Oh, Lukas baby.

01:42:33.987 --> 01:42:36.073
Jackie told me what happened.

01:42:36.949 --> 01:42:39.326
LUKAS: We left him in the pool.

01:42:40.827 --> 01:42:42.454
To rot...
(distorted) with the others.

01:42:45.582 --> 01:42:46.917
Dad used to say...

01:42:49.294 --> 01:42:52.589
...opportunity is
slippery (sniffs)

01:42:53.632 --> 01:42:55.217
Like...(crying)

01:42:56.385 --> 01:42:58.178
Like trying to catch a fish...

01:42:59.304 --> 01:43:00.722
with your bare hands.

01:43:01.932 --> 01:43:05.978
(sniffs) No matter
how much it begs,

01:43:08.605 --> 01:43:10.107
tries to slip away,

01:43:12.776 --> 01:43:14.403
(thunder clap)
hold on tight.

01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:18.156
(sniffs)
(thunder crack)

01:43:20.826 --> 01:43:23.078
And don't be afraid

01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:27.040
to get your hands dirty.

01:43:27.416 --> 01:43:32.129
Where...is...she?

01:43:35.048 --> 01:43:37.634
ANNE: She's waiting for her mom.

01:43:37.634 --> 01:43:39.052
(dramatic music)

01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:44.641
Stay with me...forever.

01:43:45.642 --> 01:43:47.436
We'll be a family again.

01:43:48.937 --> 01:43:51.815
Yes, I'll stay.

01:43:53.108 --> 01:43:55.027
(waves crashing)

01:43:55.694 --> 01:43:57.070
(tense music)

01:44:03.243 --> 01:44:05.579
CARRADINE:
It's useless trying
to leave, Clarky.

01:44:05.579 --> 01:44:08.081
DAVID: Even if I have to swim,
I'm getting off this ship.

01:44:08.081 --> 01:44:09.124
(gunshot)
(groan)

01:44:09.124 --> 01:44:10.250
(body thumps)

01:44:10.250 --> 01:44:11.710
(people shouting)

01:44:15.672 --> 01:44:17.299
(dramatic music)

01:44:18.467 --> 01:44:23.847
Outside, there are laws
and obstacles to freedom.

01:44:24.223 --> 01:44:25.891
Inside, there's only her.

01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:27.267
(gunshot)
(groan)

01:44:32.981 --> 01:44:34.483
I served my time.

01:44:37.277 --> 01:44:38.946
I served my time!

01:44:41.448 --> 01:44:42.824
I served my time!

01:44:43.158 --> 01:44:45.202
You're the guardian, Clarky.

01:44:45.744 --> 01:44:48.497
It's what they call
'a job for life'!

01:44:50.165 --> 01:44:52.626
-Gibson!
-Captain, the man is unarmed!

01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:54.044
Let go, you fool.

01:44:54.044 --> 01:44:56.338
Or he'll take us all
to a watery grave.

01:44:58.298 --> 01:45:00.008
(orchestral music)

01:45:00.008 --> 01:45:01.718
Captain! Lower your rifle,

01:45:01.718 --> 01:45:04.388
or I will have you
forcibly removed
and relieved of your duties.

01:45:04.555 --> 01:45:06.598
If you are unwilling
to perform your duty,

01:45:06.849 --> 01:45:08.267
I won't hesitate.

01:45:08.517 --> 01:45:09.893
(gunshot)

01:45:11.228 --> 01:45:12.729

01:45:19.111 --> 01:45:20.070
(gun cocks)

01:45:20.195 --> 01:45:22.906
Get back in your box!

01:45:26.410 --> 01:45:28.537
(gunshot)

01:45:29.538 --> 01:45:31.248

01:51:26.562 --> 01:51:28.021
Perhaps you can tell us.

01:51:29.481 --> 01:51:30.440
Yeah?

01:51:30.899 --> 01:51:31.900
Your secret?

01:51:32.150 --> 01:51:33.485
(gun cocks)

01:51:33.986 --> 01:51:36.196
I'm afraid I, er, I
don't know what...

01:51:36.572 --> 01:51:38.824
I, I don't know what
you mean, I...

01:51:40.701 --> 01:51:43.161
As the ship's longest
serving employee,

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:45.539
how she survived for so long?

01:51:52.796 --> 01:51:55.215
BITTNER: Well, er, (laughs)

01:51:55.340 --> 01:52:00.053
young lady, I can, er,
I can recommend just the book.

01:52:00.929 --> 01:52:02.806
Available from our gift shop!

01:52:02.806 --> 01:52:04.057
(everyone laughing)

01:52:04.099 --> 01:52:06.101
Okay, who wants a picture?
Come on, bring it in.

01:52:06.226 --> 01:52:07.186
There you go.

01:52:07.436 --> 01:52:10.647
This your first time
with a captain?
(laughs)

01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:14.443
Ah.
(camera shutter clicks)

01:52:21.867 --> 01:52:23.035
Where is she?

01:52:23.243 --> 01:52:24.286
POLICE OFFICER: She?

01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:26.538
He. My son.

01:52:28.498 --> 01:52:30.834
POLICE OFFICER: We would like to
speak with you about
the statement

01:52:30.834 --> 01:52:33.462
you provided detectives
three days ago.

01:52:34.338 --> 01:52:35.422
(high tempo music)

01:52:37.216 --> 01:52:39.843
After Lukas climbed out
his bedroom window,

01:52:40.093 --> 01:52:42.513
you said he accidentally
slipped.

01:52:42.513 --> 01:52:43.639
(window opens)

01:52:44.306 --> 01:52:45.307
And fell.

01:52:46.016 --> 01:52:49.102
Well, a neighbour
has come forward
with an account

01:52:49.311 --> 01:52:51.730
which...contradicts yours.

01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:55.108
(screams)
Help me! Please!

01:52:56.026 --> 01:52:57.945
I'm sorry about your boy.

01:52:59.404 --> 01:53:00.739
(Lukas groans)

01:53:01.198 --> 01:53:02.616
I had to escape.

01:53:04.576 --> 01:53:06.370
(groans)

01:53:06.745 --> 01:53:08.038
(window slams shut)
(Lukas screams)

01:53:08.038 --> 01:53:08.997
No.

01:53:11.041 --> 01:53:12.000
No, no.

01:53:13.794 --> 01:53:14.753
No...er...

01:53:16.713 --> 01:53:19.883
We, er...we escaped.

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:24.221
POLICE OFFICER: Miss Calder.

01:53:24.221 --> 01:53:25.681
Sir, we, we escaped.

01:53:25.806 --> 01:53:27.140
POLICE OFFICER: Miss Calder,

01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.017
you're being charged with
second degree murder.

01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:30.978
(Anne breathes deeply)

01:53:37.359 --> 01:53:39.152
POLICE OFFICER:
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:53:39.570 --> 01:53:41.280
Anything you say can

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.991
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

01:53:45.033 --> 01:53:46.743
(fading)
You have the right
to an attorney...

01:53:46.743 --> 01:53:48.036
(Anne breathing heavily)

01:53:54.751 --> 01:53:55.711
Hmm.

01:53:59.506 --> 01:54:00.799
Hmm.

01:54:01.508 --> 01:54:02.801
Hmm.

01:54:04.887 --> 01:54:06.889
(laughing)

01:54:06.889 --> 01:54:08.307
POLICE OFFICER: Miss Calder?

01:54:11.727 --> 01:54:13.478
Miss Calder?

01:54:13.937 --> 01:54:15.063
(laughing)

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:25.324
Captain Bittner for Torres.

01:54:25.532 --> 01:54:26.491
WOMAN:Please hold.

01:54:26.617 --> 01:54:28.368
(pen tapping)
(humming)

01:54:44.009 --> 01:54:45.052
(buzz)

01:54:45.052 --> 01:54:46.803
WOMAN:Mr Torres on line two.

01:54:50.015 --> 01:54:51.642
TORRES:Bittner? You there?

01:54:51.642 --> 01:54:52.684
In the flesh.

01:54:52.684 --> 01:54:53.977
(door closes)
(bolt locks)

01:54:53.977 --> 01:54:55.646
(dramatic music)

01:55:15.082 --> 01:55:18.252
(banging, screaming)

01:55:23.465 --> 01:55:25.384
BITTNER:They lived their hopes
and dreams

01:55:25.384 --> 01:55:28.679
buried in her lavish woods
and polished decks.

01:55:28.679 --> 01:55:34.184
Now, resting and all
but forgotten,
they wait to return to life.

01:55:35.811 --> 01:55:39.064
In a few moments,
the new Ghosts and Legends tour,

01:55:39.064 --> 01:55:40.691
No Escape,

01:55:40.732 --> 01:55:44.069
will disembark from
the grand staircase
on the promenade level.

01:55:44.945 --> 01:55:46.864
Join our resident guides

01:55:46.864 --> 01:55:50.409
as they lead you into the depths
of the RMS Queen Mary

01:55:50.409 --> 01:55:55.247
in an effort to connect
with spirits
who still call this ship home.

01:55:55.998 --> 01:56:00.961
That's Ghosts and Legends,
No Escape, departing soon.

01:56:01.879 --> 01:56:03.839
(high tempo music)

01:56:16.935 --> 01:56:18.520
(theme song)
