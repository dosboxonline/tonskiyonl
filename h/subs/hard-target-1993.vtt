lf he makes it to the river, he's won.

We cannot allow that to happen, Mr. Lopaki.

05:16.812 --> 05:19.356
Brandy ?

05:24.946 --> 05:26.866
lt's like a drug, isn't it ?

05:28.910 --> 05:31.538
To bring a man down.

05:37.294 --> 05:39.214
Was it worth it ?

05:40.674 --> 05:42.760
- Every nickel.
- Good.

06:40.746 --> 06:42.915
Yes ?

06:42.999 --> 06:47.588
Hi, l'm-
- l'm looking for Douglas Binder ?

06:47.671 --> 06:51.134
- You a friend of Mr. Binder's ?
- No, l--

06:51.217 --> 06:54.221
l'm-- l'm his daughter.

06:54.263 --> 06:56.675
Doug was a nice man.

06:56.701 --> 06:58.726
He had manners.

06:58.767 --> 07:03.273
He didn't tell you where he was moving, did he ?

07:03.356 --> 07:06.777
He owed some rent, honey.

07:06.819 --> 07:09.948
l told him he could wait to pay me...

07:10.032 --> 07:11.592
'til he got back on his feet.

07:11.618 --> 07:13.744
He wasn't in an accident, was he ?

07:13.785 --> 07:17.582
Oh, no.
 He lost his job with the oil tool company.

07:17.624 --> 07:19.793
When Doug moved out,

07:19.835 --> 07:23.088
he left this box.

07:25.508 --> 07:28.595
He told me l could hold it...

07:28.637 --> 07:31.890
'til he could make up his back rent.

07:35.854 --> 07:39.107
Do you have any idea where he might be now ?

07:39.149 --> 07:42.612
You might try checking down at Our Lady of Charity.

07:42.654 --> 07:44.614
Marine, huh ?

07:44.656 --> 07:46.950
Ah, Recon.

07:46.991 --> 07:49.829
- l was in the service for a while myself.
- Really ?

07:49.913 --> 07:52.332
- Yeah.
- Do you know him ?

07:52.415 --> 07:54.835
Well, he comes here sometimes.

07:54.877 --> 07:57.838
Nice guy too.
Uh, if l see him,

07:57.922 --> 08:00.967
l'll-- l'll tell him you're looking.

08:01.008 --> 08:03.763
Do you happen to know where he lives ?

08:08.059 --> 08:11.522
l-l'm afraid your--
Your daddy, uh, well--

08:11.563 --> 08:14.525
Well, he was like the rest of us: out of doors.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.528
You know ?

08:46.981 --> 08:49.401
How is that gumbo, Chance ?

08:51.236 --> 08:53.155
A tragedy.

08:53.238 --> 08:55.199
The coffee was tolerable, though.

08:55.241 --> 08:57.166
lt ain't free neither.

08:57.192 --> 08:58.854
Yeah, l know.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.332
Leave your wallet in your tuxedo ?

09:03.251 --> 09:05.420
l play that one on you before ?

09:05.462 --> 09:07.815
Yeah. For the gumbo.

09:07.841 --> 09:10.075
That's right.

09:33.037 --> 09:34.377
- lf you don't want me, baby

09:34.403 --> 09:35.982
- Hi. Do you have any change ?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.626
Baby
please tell me so

09:41.506 --> 09:43.870
- lf you don't want me, honey

09:43.896 --> 09:45.093
- Thank you.

09:45.134 --> 09:47.428
Honey please let me know

09:50.224 --> 09:53.686
But if you don't want me that bad

09:53.769 --> 09:56.983
Darlin' please let me know

10:05.367 --> 10:07.661
Hi, Murray.

10:07.703 --> 10:10.874
Yes, l was wondering if my father came to pick up his mail yet.

10:12.167 --> 10:14.360
He hasn't ?
 No, that's fine.

10:14.386 --> 10:16.030
Thank you. Bye-bye.

10:30.564 --> 10:31.647
Hello, pretty lady.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.359
Leave me the hell alone.

10:33.401 --> 10:36.029
We'll take the wallet.

10:36.112 --> 10:38.866
How about a little extra, honey ?

10:43.038 --> 10:45.540
You having fun ?

10:51.213 --> 10:55.135
Why don't you do yourself a favor, boy ?

10:55.218 --> 10:59.515
l think the favor gonna be done for you.

10:59.557 --> 11:02.727
lt's okay.

11:02.810 --> 11:05.731
l said get lost.

11:08.276 --> 11:12.239
Now, take your big stick and your boyfriend...

11:12.323 --> 11:14.992
and find a bus to catch.

11:15.076 --> 11:17.703
Oh, this guy's funny.

11:52.788 --> 11:55.291
Come on, let's go !

12:22.365 --> 12:25.243
Let's go ! Come on !

12:40.178 --> 12:41.676
You know, it's a shame.

12:41.702 --> 12:44.500
This used to be such a nice part of town.

12:48.521 --> 12:51.275
Next time be more careful when you show your wallet.

13:18.766 --> 13:21.395
Without cops, the city stops !

13:21.436 --> 13:23.480
Without cops, the city stops !

13:23.563 --> 13:25.565
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:25.607 --> 13:27.568
Without cops, the city stops !

13:27.610 --> 13:29.697
Without cops,

13:29.738 --> 13:32.866
Without cops, the city stops !

13:32.908 --> 13:35.120
Without cops, the city stops !

13:35.203 --> 13:36.830
Come on, let's hurry now !

13:36.856 --> 13:39.107
Without cops, the city stops !

13:39.165 --> 13:41.084
- Will the strike end soon ?
- Here you go.

13:41.167 --> 13:44.214
Without cops, the city stops !

13:44.256 --> 13:46.425
Without cops,
the city stops !

13:46.466 --> 13:48.760
Without cops, the city stops !

13:48.802 --> 13:51.431
Without cops,

14:01.609 --> 14:04.070
Happy birthday to me.

14:05.197 --> 14:07.116
Excuse me.

14:17.587 --> 14:18.602
Can l help you ?

14:18.628 --> 14:22.092
Yeah. l need to fill out a missing person report.

14:22.134 --> 14:24.165
Look, l just pulled a double shift.

14:24.191 --> 14:26.164
Why don't you catch me tomorrow.

14:27.808 --> 14:28.701
Okay.

14:28.727 --> 14:32.271
Why don't you catch me now.

14:32.313 --> 14:34.164
What is the name of the missing individual ?

14:34.190 --> 14:35.342
Douglas Charles Binder.

14:37.402 --> 14:39.822
Relationship of reporting party ?

14:39.864 --> 14:43.494
Daughter.

14:43.535 --> 14:46.830
- Okay. You got a picture ?
- Mm-hmm.

14:52.504 --> 14:55.508
Got something a little more recent ?

14:55.534 --> 14:57.343
Oh, no, l don't.

14:57.385 --> 15:01.014
See, my parents were divorced 20 years ago.

15:01.056 --> 15:02.431
You got an address ?

15:02.457 --> 15:04.976
l think my father was homeless.

15:05.018 --> 15:06.938
l didn't even know myself...

15:07.021 --> 15:10.317
u-until l just came down here.

15:10.359 --> 15:14.781
Look, um, l'm not sure what you want me to do here.

15:14.864 --> 15:17.492
l want you to take my report.

15:17.534 --> 15:19.869
Well, generally, in order to be considered missing,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.874
you need somewhere to be missing from.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.585
Fine.

15:25.669 --> 15:27.964
lf you're too busy to do your job, Detective,

15:28.047 --> 15:30.675
then l'll find somebody who isn't so busy.

15:30.717 --> 15:32.719
Look.

15:34.554 --> 15:38.351
You wanna find your father, take my advice: canvas the missions,

15:38.393 --> 15:41.229
ask at the shelters, but, um,

15:41.312 --> 15:43.691
get somebody who knows the city to show you around...

15:43.733 --> 15:46.235
or l'll be filling out one of these on you.

15:48.571 --> 15:50.825
Hey, you're welcome.

16:37.381 --> 16:41.468
All right, pipe down and listen up.

16:41.551 --> 16:45.098
We got 12 positions this morning, Able Seaman or better.

16:45.139 --> 16:48.394
When l call your name, come into the office, show your papers,

16:48.477 --> 16:51.147
and you'll get your ship.

16:51.189 --> 16:51.987

17:05.644 --> 17:06.665
Seeler, D. Master.

17:06.708 --> 17:08.667
l need to talk to you about something.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.502

17:11.528 --> 17:13.364
Walters, Nichols D.

17:13.424 --> 17:14.842
- Yeah.
- Able Seaman.

17:14.925 --> 17:17.345

17:17.429 --> 17:19.261
l'll pay you $100 a day.

17:19.287 --> 17:21.959
Third Mate. Stevens, Frank G.

17:22.018 --> 17:23.183
For doing what ?

17:23.209 --> 17:26.047
For $100, does it really matter ?

17:27.565 --> 17:29.776
Actually, it does.

17:29.860 --> 17:32.697
Yeah. lt does.

17:32.739 --> 17:36.368
Look, l really need you to help me find someone.

17:36.452 --> 17:38.871
Jales, Bill. Cook.

17:38.912 --> 17:42.791
You know this city, you obviously can take care of yourself.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.213

17:45.239 --> 17:47.548
Able Seaman.

17:47.590 --> 17:50.468

17:50.551 --> 17:52.633

17:52.659 --> 17:53.847
Bakelman, Fats.

17:53.889 --> 17:56.433
- Way out of town.
- Able Seaman.

17:56.516 --> 17:58.436
Sorry.

18:04.485 --> 18:07.238
Chance.
Thought you got blackballed...

18:07.280 --> 18:09.324

18:09.407 --> 18:12.912
- That was a big misunderstanding.
- Right.

18:12.995 --> 18:16.416
Broke his damn jaw is what l heard.

18:16.458 --> 18:20.337
You make sure l said a big ''hello.''

18:20.420 --> 18:22.590
Whoa. Wait a minute.

18:22.673 --> 18:25.009
Johnson says l was reinstated.

18:25.093 --> 18:26.287
With the company.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.763
Not with the union.

18:27.805 --> 18:30.600
You owe some dues here, boy.

18:30.642 --> 18:34.270
- 217 bucks.
- l'll pay that off on this cruise.

18:34.312 --> 18:37.942
No. Nobody ships out if they're in arrears, you know that.

18:38.025 --> 18:40.950
How am l gonna pay my dues if l can't get the job ?

18:40.976 --> 18:42.889
l don't make the rules, mate.

18:44.617 --> 18:48.454
Look, your ride doesn't sail 'til the end of the week.

18:48.496 --> 18:51.124

18:51.207 --> 18:53.419
Then l'll let you ship out.

Okay, down.

19:37.096 --> 19:41.018
So, this guy you're looking for, he owes you money or something ?

19:41.060 --> 19:42.723
He's my father.

19:42.749 --> 19:45.965
Okay, l change my mind.

19:46.024 --> 19:50.820

20:15.810 --> 20:18.729
No, actually, it's short for Natasha.

20:18.771 --> 20:21.066
Natasha.

20:21.149 --> 20:23.861
What kind of a name is Chance ?

20:23.903 --> 20:27.240
Well, my mama took one.

20:29.910 --> 20:32.037
So how did you lose your papa ?

20:34.248 --> 20:38.754
My parents, um, they got divorced when l was seven and my father--

20:38.838 --> 20:41.257
Well, he moved away.

20:44.260 --> 20:48.181
We started to write and he even called me a couple of times.

20:48.265 --> 20:51.352
Three weeks ago the letters just stopped.

20:55.107 --> 20:58.110
l've got a friend here who can help us.

20:58.152 --> 21:01.740
You check the line, l'll look around inside.

21:10.292 --> 21:14.463
Hey, you don't have a bottle of hot sauce on ya, do ya ?

21:14.504 --> 21:16.758
- Elijah. What's happening ?
- Hi.

21:16.799 --> 21:18.761
Wednesday meat loaf.

21:18.802 --> 21:21.180
l mean, they said it was meat loaf.

21:21.263 --> 21:23.357
l thought you were gonna get a ship.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.126
l lost my boarding pass.

21:28.313 --> 21:30.483
l've got something to show you.

21:30.566 --> 21:32.486
You two know each other ?

21:32.569 --> 21:33.477
We met yesterday.

21:33.503 --> 21:34.918
Have you seen my father ?

21:34.944 --> 21:36.598
l saw the next best thing.

21:36.656 --> 21:38.618
l was over at Plaza D'ltalia yesterday...

21:38.659 --> 21:41.788
and l saw this sleeping bag in a cart.

21:41.829 --> 21:46.795
lt was a tiger stripe, like the kind they used to issue to Recon guys.

21:46.836 --> 21:49.172
Your daddy had one just like it.

21:50.840 --> 21:52.759
- Thanks, Charlie.
- You bet.

22:50.328 --> 22:51.278
Don't be offended.

22:51.304 --> 22:52.939
He passed them out for money.

22:52.998 --> 22:56.210
Uh, yeah, l've had to do it myself.

23:01.259 --> 23:03.219
Here. Barracks Street.

23:03.261 --> 23:06.446
Both sides this time, Grandpa.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.932
Next ! Get !

23:07.974 --> 23:10.019
Here. Decatur.

23:10.045 --> 23:11.797
Lower half.

23:13.231 --> 23:16.444
Well, if it ain't my good friend Boudreaux.

23:16.486 --> 23:18.780
l thought you was gonna catch a ship.

23:18.821 --> 23:21.574
Maybe l'll stick around to run for mayor.

23:21.616 --> 23:24.077
We're looking for someone who worked for you.

23:24.119 --> 23:27.082
The man's name is Douglas Binder.

23:27.123 --> 23:28.428
l never heard of him.

23:28.454 --> 23:30.068
l think he know you.

23:30.126 --> 23:31.386
Did he work for you, sir ?

23:31.412 --> 23:33.130
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

23:33.172 --> 23:35.758
l'm not too good with names.

23:43.768 --> 23:45.895
l have a photograph.

23:49.358 --> 23:51.318
What Mr. Poe trying to say,

23:51.360 --> 23:54.240
he's not too good with faces.

23:54.323 --> 23:57.034
Right ?

23:58.661 --> 23:59.981
Hello, Randal.

24:00.007 --> 24:03.024
l didn't know you had company.

24:16.307 --> 24:19.144
We were just leaving.

24:22.064 --> 24:24.843
You know, we should go back up there.

24:24.869 --> 24:26.970
Not now. Not together.

24:27.028 --> 24:29.990
Poe knows something about my father, obviously.

24:30.031 --> 24:32.869
lf you don't want to go back up there, l'll go myself.

24:32.910 --> 24:36.582
lf you want to find your daddy, you're gonna have to work smarter,

24:36.665 --> 24:39.210
not harder.

24:39.252 --> 24:41.212
Yeah.

24:46.092 --> 24:46.983
Natasha Binder ?

24:47.009 --> 24:48.454
What's the problem ?

24:48.512 --> 24:51.141
l'm afraid l have some bad news.

24:51.224 --> 24:53.226
They found your father's body.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.260
l'm sorry.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.221
They made a positive l.D.

25:23.247 --> 25:25.165
How did it happen ?

25:25.224 --> 25:30.062
There was a fire last night in an abandoned building in the Ninth Ward.

25:30.103 --> 25:33.359
The fire department discovered your father's body in one of the rooms.

25:33.442 --> 25:35.861
l need to see him.

25:35.945 --> 25:39.908
Your daddy was burned pretty badly.

25:41.451 --> 25:44.287
The identification had to be made from dental charts...

25:44.329 --> 25:47.083
in your father's service record.

25:56.136 --> 25:59.139
What's your involvement here ?

25:59.180 --> 26:01.559
l was helping her find her daddy.

26:31.011 --> 26:35.266
Wakey, wakey, you fat fuck !

26:45.069 --> 26:47.030
Oh, God !

26:47.071 --> 26:49.283
Mr. Fouchon, what are you doing here ?

26:49.366 --> 26:52.620
- Aah ! Oww !
- Don't talk, Randal. Listen.

26:52.703 --> 26:54.622
Oh, don't worry about Randal.

26:54.705 --> 26:57.167
- Aah !
- He's all ears.

26:57.209 --> 27:00.546
When Mr. Van Cleaf came upon your visitors yesterday,

27:00.630 --> 27:03.342
you neglected to tell him that they were inquiring...

27:03.383 --> 27:05.208
about one of our volunteers.

27:05.234 --> 27:07.579
That was nothin', Mr. Fouchon.

27:07.638 --> 27:09.723
Oh, it was something, Randal.

27:22.823 --> 27:25.910
This man we hunted last night.

27:25.993 --> 27:28.872
Why don't you tell us his real name ?

27:28.914 --> 27:31.416
- You fuck.
- Binder. Binder.

27:31.442 --> 27:32.777
Douglas Binder.

27:32.836 --> 27:35.588
That's not the one we selected, is it ?

27:35.672 --> 27:38.049
l-l couldn't get the guy you asked for.

27:38.091 --> 27:42.013
Look, y-you said you wanted a combat veteran, so l sent you Binder.

27:42.097 --> 27:44.457
- He has more medals.
- He had a family.

27:44.483 --> 27:46.209
Now they're asking questions.

27:46.268 --> 27:48.437
Please. Please.
l said l was sorry. l sai--

27:48.521 --> 27:49.987
Aah ! l said l was sorry.

27:50.013 --> 27:52.300
Careless is what you are, Randal.

27:52.358 --> 27:54.569
Careless and stupid...

27:54.610 --> 27:56.739
and now you're sorry, too.

27:56.781 --> 27:59.117
He said he--
He said he was alone.

27:59.200 --> 28:01.355
l didn't know he had any relatives.
Honest.

28:01.381 --> 28:02.579
You made a mistake ?

28:02.620 --> 28:04.456
- ls that what you're saying ?
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:04.540 --> 28:07.418
Uh-huh.
And l see you're anxious to make up for it, aren't you ?

28:07.459 --> 28:10.590
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Yes. Yes, sir.

28:10.631 --> 28:14.969
We've got another client and he's about to select a new playmate.

28:19.141 --> 28:22.269
Next time send us the one we ask for.

28:22.311 --> 28:26.484
l will, Mr. Fouchon, l swear. l--

28:27.902 --> 28:31.113
l think we understand each other.

28:31.155 --> 28:34.910
- Yes ? No ?
- Yes. Yeah.

28:34.993 --> 28:36.953
Randal.

28:36.995 --> 28:39.790
l come back here,

28:39.832 --> 28:41.793
l cut me a steak.

28:47.174 --> 28:49.135
You did your best.

28:49.177 --> 28:51.679
No, l--
l came too late.

28:51.763 --> 28:55.351
l mean, Jesus, he was living out of a shopping cart.

28:55.392 --> 28:58.313
Goddamn it.

28:58.355 --> 29:01.399
Why didn't he just...
tell me ?

29:01.483 --> 29:04.111
Why didn't he ask for my help ?

29:04.195 --> 29:08.033
l've been there myself on the street.

29:08.075 --> 29:10.577
lt's hard.

29:10.661 --> 29:12.580
lt's hard to...

29:12.664 --> 29:14.707
put your hand out.

29:14.749 --> 29:17.585
l just kept thinking if l could...

29:20.382 --> 29:23.343
just tell him that l loved him.

29:25.220 --> 29:28.808
And because he loved you so much,

29:28.891 --> 29:31.686
he didn't want to pull you into it.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.238
- Our friend, Mr. Boudreaux.
- Mm-hmm.

29:41.657 --> 29:43.534
Silver Star.

29:43.576 --> 29:45.536
Marine Force Recon.

29:45.578 --> 29:48.414
He joined the Merchant Service after he got out.

29:48.497 --> 29:50.710
His captain was smuggling opium.

29:50.751 --> 29:54.505
When Boudreaux found out, he threw the man overboard.

29:54.589 --> 29:57.092
He's been looking for work ever since.

29:57.134 --> 30:00.721
He's obviously not someone we should underestimate.

30:00.762 --> 30:04.059
He was raised in the bayous by his uncle.

30:04.101 --> 30:06.395
l think Mr. Boudreaux...

30:06.437 --> 30:09.106
would make a very interesting quarry.

30:10.649 --> 30:13.778
Maybe l should, uh, pay him a visit.

30:13.862 --> 30:15.780
No, no, no, no, no.

30:15.864 --> 30:19.578
Send a couple of lads down there to have a chat with him.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.580
Yeah.

Yeah.

31:59.406 --> 32:01.408
Bingo.

32:34.531 --> 32:37.910
Some friendly advice, Boudreaux: Get the fuck outta Dodge !

32:37.952 --> 32:38.678
Do it today !

32:38.704 --> 32:41.081
And tell that bitch girlfriend of yours...

32:41.122 --> 32:44.043
to point her titties north and step on the gas !

32:51.802 --> 32:54.138
lt's always nice to see you.

32:54.180 --> 32:56.599
You seem to have a real talent, Mr. Boudreaux,

32:56.641 --> 32:58.644
for attracting violence.

32:58.727 --> 33:01.146
Does that make me a bad person ?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.441
Why did you arrest me for,

33:04.483 --> 33:07.153
getting beat up without a license ?

33:07.237 --> 33:09.053
Thank you for calling me.

33:09.079 --> 33:11.158
Oh, my God, you look awful.

33:11.200 --> 33:13.620
Darling, you hurt my feelings.

33:13.662 --> 33:16.164
What we have here is a charge sheet.

33:16.206 --> 33:19.751
Willfully crossing a police barrier; that's considered Criminal Trespass.

33:19.835 --> 33:23.007
Yes, that officer was nice enough to mention that to me.

33:23.090 --> 33:25.593
- What were you doing at the house ?
- The dog tag...

33:25.676 --> 33:28.138
you find in that fire ?

33:28.179 --> 33:30.140
They always come in twos.

33:30.181 --> 33:33.351
So l went back to that place to look for the other one.

33:35.061 --> 33:38.358
Your daddy, he didn't die in the fire.

33:39.902 --> 33:40.850
He was murdered.

33:40.876 --> 33:42.889
There's no evidence of that.

33:42.947 --> 33:45.033
There is now.

33:47.076 --> 33:51.291
That hole in that tag was made by something sharp and hard.

33:51.374 --> 33:54.044
And l'll bet my rent money it was made...

33:54.085 --> 33:57.005
when Binder was still wearing it.

33:57.047 --> 34:00.635
Why would somebody go through all this trouble to kill a homeless man ?

34:00.718 --> 34:02.188
Do you believe us now ?

34:02.214 --> 34:04.681
The wheels turn slow around here.

34:04.723 --> 34:07.352
- Real slow.
- But they do turn.

34:10.563 --> 34:13.067
l'll order a new autopsy.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.069
This'll help.

34:23.286 --> 34:24.949
You should see a doctor.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.774
l hate them doctors.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.959
Yeah-- Aah ! Shit !

35:02.001 --> 35:03.961
Goddamn it.

35:05.087 --> 35:08.550
What ? Not now.

35:17.811 --> 35:20.439
So-- So, you in 'Nam ?

35:20.480 --> 35:23.067
Yeah, a long time ago.

35:23.151 --> 35:25.278
lt seems to me a man with your obvious experience...

35:25.320 --> 35:27.280
should be pullin' down a lot more money.

35:30.493 --> 35:33.830
You're gonna pay me 100 bucks to fill out a form ?

35:33.872 --> 35:36.792
l'll pay you a lot more than that if you got the experience.

35:41.172 --> 35:43.801
What kind of experience ?

35:43.843 --> 35:46.012
Well, maybe you ain't interested.

35:46.054 --> 35:48.681
Uh, no.

35:48.765 --> 35:51.185
l'll fill out the application.

35:51.227 --> 35:52.328
You got any family ?

35:52.354 --> 35:53.979
Anybody to worry about you ?

35:54.021 --> 35:56.023
Friends ?
Anything like that ?

35:56.106 --> 35:58.526
l got nobody.

36:16.215 --> 36:19.885
You'll deposit $500,000 in our account...

36:19.927 --> 36:21.888
in a bank in the Cayman lslands.

36:21.930 --> 36:25.058
Do not refer to our agreement by telex...

36:25.141 --> 36:27.061
or in conversations on the phone.

36:29.147 --> 36:32.067
You'll be provided with a guide, trackers...

36:32.150 --> 36:34.486
and the weapon of your choice.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.948
Naturally, we will dispose of the body...

36:37.031 --> 36:41.495
and provide you with an out-of-town, airtight alibi.

36:41.579 --> 36:45.458
Don't worry, Mr. Zenan, all you have to do is point and shoot.

36:53.759 --> 36:56.888
Mr. Zenan has made his selection.

36:56.930 --> 36:58.805
A black man named Roper.

36:58.831 --> 37:01.227
Used to be in Special Forces.

37:01.269 --> 37:03.354
Excellent.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.898
l don't see any problem with your choice.

37:05.940 --> 37:08.527
lt has always been the privilege of the few...

37:08.611 --> 37:10.530
to hunt the many.

37:10.614 --> 37:14.952
Soldiers, policemen, fighter pilots.

37:15.036 --> 37:17.914
Men who kill for the government do so with impunity.

37:17.955 --> 37:20.124
All we do is offer the same opportunity...

37:20.166 --> 37:22.461
for private citizens such as yourself.

37:22.544 --> 37:25.411
These opponents, they're volunteers ?

37:25.437 --> 37:26.908
More or less.

37:26.966 --> 37:29.762
The same government that has made murder their sole preserve,

37:29.803 --> 37:31.764
they train our targets.

37:31.805 --> 37:35.100
We pride ourselves on only hunting combat veterans,

37:35.142 --> 37:37.228
men who have the necessary skills...

37:37.312 --> 37:39.320
to make our hunts more interesting.

37:39.346 --> 37:40.983
What about the police ?

37:41.025 --> 37:43.903
l'm sure that they would be interested if they were to find out.

37:43.986 --> 37:46.448
Dr. Morton here assists us...

37:46.490 --> 37:49.409
with the formality of police autopsies.

37:49.493 --> 37:51.997
lt's no accident that we're in New Orleans.

37:52.081 --> 37:55.668
Last year we conducted hunts in Rio de Janeiro at Carnival,

37:55.751 --> 37:58.087
Yugoslavia during the late unpleasantness.

37:58.170 --> 38:00.257
Oh, yeah.

38:00.340 --> 38:04.511
You see, there's always some unhappy little corner of the planet...

38:04.594 --> 38:07.224
where we can ply our trade.

38:07.307 --> 38:09.226
All right, Mr. Fouchon.

38:11.019 --> 38:14.524
- You have a client.
- Well,

38:14.607 --> 38:17.360
thank you for visiting, Mr. Zenan.

38:17.443 --> 38:19.862
Dr. Morton will show you to the car.

38:19.946 --> 38:22.701
My bank will arrange the transfer of funds within the hour.

38:22.742 --> 38:25.036
- Excellent.
- When do we go out ?

38:25.078 --> 38:28.707
We'll contact you when the necessary arrangements have been made.

38:37.427 --> 38:40.680
Chance. What you doing here ?

38:40.722 --> 38:44.058
- Secret mission.
- Mmmm.

38:44.100 --> 38:48.063
Rub me, baby.

39:05.293 --> 39:07.588
Oh, yeah, baby.

39:07.630 --> 39:10.341
Hello, Poe.

39:10.424 --> 39:13.385
What the fuck ?

39:13.427 --> 39:14.353
You miss me ?

39:14.379 --> 39:16.373
Aw, Christ, not again.

39:16.431 --> 39:18.476
Looks like you're short an ear,

39:18.559 --> 39:21.270
so you better listen very carefully.

39:21.354 --> 39:26.026
- Now, are you paying attention ?
- Uh-huh.

39:26.109 --> 39:28.195
Who sent those apes after me ?

39:28.278 --> 39:30.365
l don't know what you're talking about.

39:32.534 --> 39:34.620
Two million people in this city.

39:34.662 --> 39:38.291
- Who's gonna miss a fat slob like you, Poe, huh ?
- Van Cleaf !

39:38.375 --> 39:40.293
H-His name was Van Cleaf.

39:40.377 --> 39:42.420
Good boy.
Where is he ?

39:42.462 --> 39:44.310
l don't know where he lives !

39:44.336 --> 39:45.993
He ain't even American !

39:46.051 --> 39:48.929
Look, he'll-- He'll kill me if l don't do what he says !

39:48.971 --> 39:51.348
You gotta believe that !
Aaah !

39:51.431 --> 39:53.893
Tell your boyfriend Van Cleaf...

39:53.977 --> 39:57.438
l'm gonna find out who killed Douglas Binder.

39:57.480 --> 40:00.777
lf you understand me, just grunt.

40:02.821 --> 40:05.824
Again.

40:18.047 --> 40:22.010
Did you get my memo ?

40:22.051 --> 40:24.930
Binder, Douglas C.

40:25.014 --> 40:27.934
l want you to take another look at the post-mortem.

40:29.436 --> 40:33.274
That memo contains evidence...

40:33.357 --> 40:37.028
that might make Binder's death a homicide.

40:37.111 --> 40:40.365
Now, you can act on it, Doctor, or you can file it,

40:40.407 --> 40:44.162
but if l have to get a court order for a formal inquest,

40:44.203 --> 40:46.707
l will.

41:00.974 --> 41:03.226
You should do something about that cough.

41:03.310 --> 41:07.356
Don't you ever knock ?

41:16.242 --> 41:18.450
We have a problem.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.438
A big problem.

41:20.497 --> 41:23.166
They want me to redo the autopsy on Binder.

41:26.755 --> 41:28.481
Who is it that's asking ?

41:28.507 --> 41:30.784
A detective named Mitchell.

41:30.843 --> 41:33.262
Binder's family's breathing down her neck.

41:34.597 --> 41:37.725
- Can we buy her ?
- No.

41:44.275 --> 41:47.113
l guess we've overstayed our welcome.

41:50.783 --> 41:53.453
Tonight is our last hunt in New Orleans.

42:00.461 --> 42:02.965
Open it.

42:34.627 --> 42:37.048
What a funny little man, eh ?

42:37.131 --> 42:38.783
A change of scenery's what we need.

42:38.809 --> 42:40.035
Something less tropical.

42:41.762 --> 42:43.764
Rolling hills, castles.

42:45.807 --> 42:46.601
Eastern Europe.

42:46.627 --> 42:48.211
We can work there for years.

43:25.940 --> 43:26.938
Where's Poe ?

43:26.964 --> 43:29.343
Mr. Poe couldn't make it.

43:29.402 --> 43:31.320
He's got an ear infection.

43:34.492 --> 43:37.370
Look, he, uh, he said he'd have some work for me.

43:37.412 --> 43:40.332
That may still be a possibility.

43:41.917 --> 43:45.170
We got a little game we'd like you to play with us.

43:47.925 --> 43:50.052
This money belt...

43:50.094 --> 43:52.930
has $10,000 in it.

43:53.014 --> 43:56.059
lt's all yours if you want it, every penny.

43:57.102 --> 43:59.521
What do l have to do ?

43:59.604 --> 44:02.568
The rules of the game are very simple.

44:02.609 --> 44:04.714
All you have to do is get to the river.

44:04.740 --> 44:06.305
Ten miles through the city.

44:06.363 --> 44:10.869
You and the money belt make it to the river, you're $10,000 richer.

44:10.952 --> 44:12.871
Bullshit.

44:14.039 --> 44:16.334
Maybe you like being the object of pity,

44:16.417 --> 44:19.546
begging for quarters, sleeping in the rain,

44:19.629 --> 44:22.049
listening to a half an hour of fire and brimstone...

44:22.132 --> 44:23.758
for a bowl of soup.

44:23.784 --> 44:25.470
Man, fuck you.

44:25.511 --> 44:27.722
You could change everything tonight.

44:27.805 --> 44:31.435
Think of what $10,000 could buy you.

44:31.477 --> 44:34.773
You could get new clothes, clean yourself up,

44:34.814 --> 44:38.318
look men in the eyes when you pass them on the street.

44:38.360 --> 44:41.405
This money could make you a man again,

44:41.489 --> 44:44.618
instead of the shadow of your former self.

44:50.333 --> 44:52.603
l get to the river, l get the cash.

44:52.629 --> 44:53.861
Every nickel.

44:56.340 --> 44:57.980
lf l don't make it ?

44:58.006 --> 45:01.037
Oh, you're a sports fan, Roper.

45:01.096 --> 45:03.599
Figure it out.

45:13.444 --> 45:15.767
You've got a five minute head start.

45:15.793 --> 45:16.889
Don't waste it.

45:41.061 --> 45:44.064
This is New Orleans, Mr. Zenan,

45:44.148 --> 45:46.066
not Beirut.

46:24.780 --> 46:26.741
After you, sir.

46:29.535 --> 46:32.205
- Mr. Zenan, take it off ''safe.''
- Oh.

47:33.529 --> 47:35.991
Finish him.

47:36.033 --> 47:38.052
l don't want him.

47:38.078 --> 47:39.978
H-He's wounded.

47:40.037 --> 47:42.498
- Finish him.
- l can't do that. l hit him.

47:42.540 --> 47:43.996
l shot him. Let's go, okay ?

47:44.022 --> 47:46.986
Listen, don't make me look bad in front of my dogs.

47:47.045 --> 47:48.965
You know why you're here ?

47:49.049 --> 47:51.217
You paid us a half a million dollars...

47:51.301 --> 47:53.928
to find out if you're alive or dead.

47:54.012 --> 47:56.807
Now finish him.

47:56.891 --> 47:59.268
Finish him !

47:59.351 --> 48:01.812
God, why didn't he go fishing ?

48:40.651 --> 48:43.446
Now you understand why we insist on payment up front.

48:47.034 --> 48:48.954
Here.

48:50.372 --> 48:52.958
Set the dogs on him, won't you, Pick ?

48:52.999 --> 48:54.793
l don't wanna be out here all night.

49:00.843 --> 49:04.264
Help me !
Please ! Please !

49:11.480 --> 49:14.359
Help me !

49:14.443 --> 49:16.820
H-- Please !
Help me ! Help me !

49:16.862 --> 49:18.822
- Go on, get a job !
- Please !

49:18.864 --> 49:20.885
- Please !
- Watch it ! Damn !

49:20.911 --> 49:21.993
Watch yourself !

49:22.034 --> 49:25.663
Help me. Help me !

49:25.705 --> 49:30.170
Help me ! Please !

49:36.051 --> 49:38.137
Hey, look !
Come on, man !

49:38.179 --> 49:39.196
Walk on by, now, man.

49:39.222 --> 49:41.207
Call the police here or somethin' !

49:41.265 --> 49:43.144
Help me !

49:45.104 --> 49:46.587
Hey ! Hey ! Let me in !
Come on, man !

49:46.613 --> 49:47.523
No, we're closed !

49:47.565 --> 49:49.610
Let me in !

49:49.693 --> 49:52.029
Hey, buddy !
Hey ! Hey ! Come on !

49:52.112 --> 49:53.147
Brother, get out of here, man.

49:53.173 --> 49:54.079
Come on, get out of here.

49:54.105 --> 49:54.932
Hey, come on, man !

49:54.990 --> 49:58.204
- Help me !
- Hey ! l ain't got no change, man !

51:39.992 --> 51:42.829
He was passin' out flyers for Randal Poe.

51:42.913 --> 51:45.582
Let's pay him a visit.

52:46.488 --> 52:49.409
Randal, Randal, Randal.

52:50.786 --> 52:54.248
You were gonna leave without saying good-bye ?

52:56.417 --> 52:59.045
My mama got sick in Biloxi.
l--

53:01.257 --> 53:03.468
l was gonna call you, Mr. Van Cleaf.

53:03.551 --> 53:06.013
Of course you were, Randal.

53:06.096 --> 53:08.515
Of course you were.

53:08.599 --> 53:13.020
l know you didn't mean to hurt my feelings.

53:13.104 --> 53:15.691
Hmm ?

54:01.621 --> 54:04.749
Looks like we missed
the party.

54:12.425 --> 54:14.637
- Get down !
- Ooh !

54:40.585 --> 54:42.170
Stay down !

55:03.737 --> 55:04.607
Go !

55:04.633 --> 55:06.807
Go ! Go !

56:20.454 --> 56:21.063
Let's go.

56:21.089 --> 56:23.525
We can't just leave her here !

56:25.169 --> 56:26.575
Keep him in the Quarter.

56:26.601 --> 56:27.629
Stay on his ass.

56:27.671 --> 56:29.530
She's dead.

56:29.556 --> 56:31.075
Come on.

57:07.052 --> 57:08.471
Grab the bar !

59:14.205 --> 59:15.832
Yeah !

59:58.925 --> 01:00:01.470
Ladies first.

01:00:01.554 --> 01:00:03.472

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:34.885
lt appears we'll have one last hunt after all, Pick.

01:01:07.967 --> 01:01:10.637
The train went by maybe two,

01:01:10.679 --> 01:01:13.348
two and a half hours ago.

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:14.996
This could be dangerous.

01:01:15.022 --> 01:01:16.627
We're on his turf now.

01:01:16.686 --> 01:01:20.315
Thank you, gentlemen, for making yourselves available on short notice.

01:01:20.357 --> 01:01:23.318
We are stalking an exceptional opponent.

01:01:24.863 --> 01:01:27.657
Truly a world-class trophy.

01:01:27.699 --> 01:01:30.743
The price for participating in this little excursion...

01:01:30.827 --> 01:01:33.123
is $750,000 each.

01:01:33.206 --> 01:01:35.709
Should one of you be lucky enough to bring him down,

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.794
l'll consider that hunter's account paid in full.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:46.095
Shouldn't we be worried about alligators or something ?

01:01:46.178 --> 01:01:48.224
lf it make you feel better,

01:01:48.308 --> 01:01:50.226
yeah.

01:01:56.233 --> 01:01:57.774
Come on, keep going.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:01:59.803
lt's still a long way...

01:01:59.862 --> 01:02:01.108
to Uncle Douvee's place.

01:02:01.134 --> 01:02:03.935
At least they won't be able to find us out here.

01:02:03.993 --> 01:02:08.164
Yes, they will, if they have a tracker as good as Uncle Douvee.

01:02:08.247 --> 01:02:11.501
All they have to do is to check along the railroad.

01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:14.797
l'm just guessing we have a couple of hours.

01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:17.783
- Okay.
- Maybe less. Come on.

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:18.744
Let's go.

01:02:28.104 --> 01:02:30.942
lsn't there
a trail or something ?

01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:34.071
This is the trail.

01:02:35.155 --> 01:02:37.783
You're really enjoying yourself, aren't you, Chance ?

01:02:37.866 --> 01:02:42.247
lf it's tough for us, it's tough for them.

01:02:47.212 --> 01:02:49.130
You trust me ?

01:02:50.715 --> 01:02:53.134
Of course l trust you.

01:02:53.218 --> 01:02:56.764
Close your eyes.

01:02:56.806 --> 01:03:00.811
Why do you want me to trust you with my eyes closed ?

01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.774
Close your eyes.

01:03:37.688 --> 01:03:40.818
- ls it dead ?
- Not hardly.

01:03:45.031 --> 01:03:47.784
What are you doing ?

01:03:47.868 --> 01:03:50.329
l'm leaving a surprise for my friends.

01:04:10.854 --> 01:04:13.482
Son of a bitch !

01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:47.815
lf you would die quieter and pick up the pace,

01:04:47.898 --> 01:04:50.859
Boudreaux would have less time for these little surprises.

01:04:50.943 --> 01:04:53.154
Jerome !

01:04:53.238 --> 01:04:55.825
Would you be so kind ?

01:04:55.908 --> 01:04:59.662
And do watch your step, won't you ? Let's go.

01:05:30.908 --> 01:05:34.163
Sometime l amaze myself, me !

01:05:34.246 --> 01:05:35.706
ls good whiskey !

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:38.651
Make jack rabbit slap the bear !

01:05:57.398 --> 01:06:00.401
- Chance ? Chance.
- Yeah !

01:06:08.370 --> 01:06:11.874
You come to see your Uncle Douvee.

01:06:14.752 --> 01:06:18.257
Natasha, my Uncle Douvee.

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:20.843
Enchanté, mademoiselle.

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.973
We'll fix him up good.

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:27.584
Put bandage on, it no hurt.

01:06:27.643 --> 01:06:28.987
Be strong, my boy.

01:06:29.013 --> 01:06:32.299
Douvee, l've got some people after me.

01:06:32.357 --> 01:06:36.487
l know.
l can smell them.

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:39.824
You've still got a .30-06, the one l gave you for your birthday ?

01:06:39.907 --> 01:06:42.661
No. A gator ate it.

01:06:44.121 --> 01:06:47.375
But, uh,

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:49.378
l've still got your shotgun.

01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:42.192
So tell me, this mans what chase after you,

01:07:42.275 --> 01:07:44.819
he mad at you for business or pleasure ?

01:07:44.861 --> 01:07:48.615
- Both.
- Uh-huh.

01:07:48.657 --> 01:07:52.203
l'm going to take Elvira south, then to Bayou La Fouche,

01:07:52.286 --> 01:07:54.205
Mardi Gras graveyard.

01:07:54.288 --> 01:07:58.878
lf you can talk her into it, go ahead.

01:07:58.962 --> 01:08:01.089
You be careful.

01:08:07.429 --> 01:08:09.933
Don't worry about me.

01:08:10.016 --> 01:08:11.936
l love the company.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:18.631
Be careful.

01:08:18.657 --> 01:08:21.388
Without you, l'm hunting them.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:52.191
He's gonna be all right.

01:08:52.233 --> 01:08:54.528
Oui. Come.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:56.529
We go.

01:09:39.666 --> 01:09:41.134
Here, drink.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:43.362
But do not spill.

01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:45.339
lt kill the grass.

01:09:47.466 --> 01:09:48.935
The place is clean.

01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:50.121
He just left.

01:10:34.898 --> 01:10:37.235
Get the fuck down !

01:11:11.567 --> 01:11:13.528
Hey !

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:15.365
Hold it !

01:11:17.408 --> 01:11:20.663
Boudreaux is the target we're after.

01:11:22.289 --> 01:11:25.584
You are a fucking buffalo !

01:11:25.626 --> 01:11:26.752
Move !

01:11:40.143 --> 01:11:43.909
Boudreaux went this way, maybe ten, 15 minutes ago.

01:11:43.935 --> 01:11:45.092
He's on a horse.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:49.488
He's trying to lead us away from his friends.

01:11:51.533 --> 01:11:54.244
Get in the fucking trucks.

01:11:54.285 --> 01:11:56.115
Move !
Fucking move !

01:11:56.141 --> 01:11:58.233
Will you move ?
Move !

01:11:59.918 --> 01:12:01.837
They're fucking brain-dead.

01:12:04.464 --> 01:12:05.741
Get the helicopter.

01:12:05.768 --> 01:12:06.909
Find Boudreaux.

01:12:06.968 --> 01:12:09.693
We'll set up an ambush this side of Bayou La Fouche.

01:12:09.719 --> 01:12:11.415
l can take him from the air.

01:12:11.473 --> 01:12:13.037
Any pinhead can take him from the air.

01:12:13.063 --> 01:12:14.602
l want to take him from the ground !

01:12:14.644 --> 01:12:15.729
l can take him

01:12:15.755 --> 01:12:16.813
from the air.

01:12:16.855 --> 01:12:18.216
Be a professional, Pick.

01:12:18.242 --> 01:12:20.508
Hey, you're making a mistake here.

01:12:21.736 --> 01:12:24.572
Make sure he gets there, Pick.

01:12:55.568 --> 01:12:57.528
That's him.

01:16:16.935 --> 01:16:19.313
Hey, pigeon.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:47.972
Avril Pybus has a store two miles this way.

01:16:48.014 --> 01:16:51.184
You go to a telephone, call the sheriff.

01:16:51.267 --> 01:16:53.813
You know,

01:16:53.896 --> 01:16:57.150
chére, l think you should call the sheriff.

01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:04.826
lt appears your trophy's ripping us a new orifice.

01:17:04.867 --> 01:17:08.330
Let me review the tactical situation for you, gentlemen.

01:17:08.414 --> 01:17:09.401
Boudreaux is wounded.

01:17:09.427 --> 01:17:11.025
He's been pursued and harried...

01:17:11.084 --> 01:17:13.420
across miles of open country.

01:17:13.503 --> 01:17:17.091
Now he's cornered and outnumbered 20 to 1.

01:17:17.174 --> 01:17:19.719
He's an annoying little fucking insect...

01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:22.346
and l want him stepped on, hard.

01:17:23.765 --> 01:17:27.353
You're not angry with me, are you, Pick ?

01:17:27.395 --> 01:17:30.524
l don't get angry.

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:32.526
l'm a professional.

01:18:01.227 --> 01:18:03.021
Let's move !

01:19:03.719 --> 01:19:05.638
This is not good.

01:19:07.515 --> 01:19:11.061
lf we walk away now, we can be in Mexico in five hours.

01:19:11.145 --> 01:19:13.605
What the fuck is the matter with you, Pick ?

01:19:13.647 --> 01:19:15.649
Hunting drunks in alleys made you soft ?

01:20:01.371 --> 01:20:05.835
God, that son-of-a-bitch is good !

01:20:05.877 --> 01:20:09.965
Goddamn it, l'm gonna blow his goddamn head off !

01:20:10.049 --> 01:20:13.052
What are you lookin' at, you sons-of-bitches ?

01:20:13.135 --> 01:20:15.241
This is what you paid for !

01:20:15.267 --> 01:20:16.123
Get him !

01:20:30.907 --> 01:20:32.993
Seal off this place.

01:20:35.162 --> 01:20:37.081
The son-of-a-bitch is mine.

01:21:30.312 --> 01:21:33.816
Sorry about the shirt.

01:21:36.444 --> 01:21:37.945
Give it a rest, pal.

01:21:46.206 --> 01:21:49.960
- Now what do you want to do ?
- Now--

01:21:50.002 --> 01:21:53.422
Now we put arrow into everyone what's not Chance, huh ?

01:21:53.506 --> 01:21:55.551
Come.

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:41.356
You fuckin' bitch !

01:22:47.738 --> 01:22:49.907
Now--
Now look what you do.

01:22:49.949 --> 01:22:51.088
Give me this gun.

01:22:51.114 --> 01:22:53.187
l take care all this bad guy.

01:22:53.245 --> 01:22:55.164
Give me this gun !

01:23:29.205 --> 01:23:31.916
Chance !

01:23:59.699 --> 01:24:01.449
l told you to go for help.

01:24:01.475 --> 01:24:02.687
But we help.

01:24:02.745 --> 01:24:04.562
All these men try to kill you.

01:24:04.588 --> 01:24:05.858
We're here to help.

01:25:05.446 --> 01:25:08.616
Boudreaux, Boudreaux, Boudreaux.

01:25:11.995 --> 01:25:15.124
l've been looking
all over for you.

01:25:15.208 --> 01:25:18.516
You've been looking in the wrong places.

01:25:18.542 --> 01:25:20.030
That's good,

01:25:20.088 --> 01:25:23.342
'cause l know you wouldn't want to... hurt my feelings.

01:27:18.438 --> 01:27:20.734
Can you get up ?

01:27:20.776 --> 01:27:23.445
l cannot dance, but l can get up.

01:28:05.538 --> 01:28:07.832
Hey !

01:28:52.510 --> 01:28:55.222
Hey !

01:28:58.351 --> 01:29:01.522
You lucky son-of-a-bitch !

01:29:01.605 --> 01:29:05.276
- You want some more of that ?
- Yeah !

01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:11.074
How does it feel to be hunted ?

01:29:11.824 --> 01:29:14.079
You tell me !

01:29:14.162 --> 01:29:16.706
You should know better.

01:29:16.748 --> 01:29:21.212
There isn't a country in the world l haven't fired a bullet in!

01:29:23.714 --> 01:29:26.050
You can't kill me!

01:29:26.092 --> 01:29:28.346
You can't kill me!

01:29:33.351 --> 01:29:34.727
l'm on every battlefield!

01:29:38.732 --> 01:29:40.901
There's no winner here!

01:29:40.943 --> 01:29:42.403
l don't see one.

01:29:42.444 --> 01:29:44.365
You're looking at him!

01:29:46.242 --> 01:29:47.824
Come on, you son-of-a-bitch !

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.103
Take your best shot !

01:30:05.765 --> 01:30:06.766
Chance !

01:30:08.768 --> 01:30:09.769
Chance !

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:17.613
My boy !

Just shoot him !

01:30:35.801 --> 01:30:38.346
You won't do that, will you, Mr. Boudreaux?

01:30:38.429 --> 01:30:39.616
Chance, please !

01:30:39.642 --> 01:30:42.434
lf he shoots me, he'll kill you.

01:30:42.476 --> 01:30:46.439
He's picked the wrong tool for the job.

01:30:50.652 --> 01:30:53.531
Put the weapon down...

01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:56.743
or l'll run her through !

01:30:59.038 --> 01:31:00.706
No !

01:31:26.529 --> 01:31:29.825
You see, Miss Binder,

01:31:29.866 --> 01:31:33.370
you l can understand; it was a matter of family.

01:31:33.453 --> 01:31:37.710
You had nothing in common with those people.

01:31:37.793 --> 01:31:41.505
What made you want to complicate my life like this ?

01:31:43.549 --> 01:31:45.510
Poor people get bored too.

01:31:47.929 --> 01:31:49.723
- Come here.
- Please.

01:31:56.273 --> 01:31:58.902
Load me.

01:33:52.914 --> 01:33:56.125
Hunting season... is over.

01:34:28.206 --> 01:34:29.959
Douvee !

01:34:30.042 --> 01:34:31.961
Douvee !

01:34:33.212 --> 01:34:35.965
What is this noise ?

01:34:36.048 --> 01:34:37.076
l was dreaming.

01:34:37.102 --> 01:34:38.952
Chére, l think about you.

01:34:39.010 --> 01:34:43.307
l tell this turkey, he no kill this eagle.

01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:46.561
Some headache l got here!

01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:53.820
Oh, my God.

01:34:55.948 --> 01:34:58.993
- What ?
- l think l hurt pretty bad.

01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:07.043
Now this, this real catastrophe !

01:35:07.127 --> 01:35:09.673
- This real bad.
- Yeah, real bad.

01:35:12.175 --> 01:35:16.472
<i>Ah, when l was just a little boy</i>

01:35:16.514 --> 01:35:20.602
<i>A-standin' to my daddy's knee</i>

01:35:20.643 --> 01:35:24.649
<i>My papa said, Son don't let the man get ya</i>

01:35:24.691 --> 01:35:27.277
<i>And do what he done to me</i>

01:35:29.904 --> 01:35:32.158
<i>Born on the bayou</i>

01:35:34.035 --> 01:35:37.121
<i>Born on the bayou</i>
