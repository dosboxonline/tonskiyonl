<i>his son, Jalal,</i>

16:22.858 --> 16:26.195
<i>for an attack on a government</i>

16:26.278 --> 16:29.031

16:34.828 --> 16:36.622

16:36.705 --> 16:37.956
<i>based on my meetings with him,</i>

16:38.040 --> 16:40.042

28:51.523 --> 28:53.025

28:53.108 --> 28:55.527
-We?
-SAUL: Yes.

28:55.611 --> 28:58.363
'Cause we know the truth,
the three of us.

28:58.447 --> 28:59.698
Haissam Haqqani
didn't shoot down

28:59.781 --> 29:02.743
the presidents' helicopter,
quite the opposite.

29:02.826 --> 29:05.287
He was looking forward
to meeting the men on board.

29:06.955 --> 29:10.209
He wanted to stop the fighting.

29:10.292 --> 29:12.794
I have signals intercepts
to prove it.

29:12.878 --> 29:14.379
So make them public.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.215
I've been told
in no uncertain terms I can't.

29:16.298 --> 29:18.217
Or maybe you don't
actually have them.

29:20.969 --> 29:23.889
Your father and I
have an agreement.

29:23.972 --> 29:26.350
Whatever we say out there,

29:26.433 --> 29:29.061
here in this room,
we tell the truth.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.647
You want to be here,
then you do that too.

29:31.730 --> 29:33.649
You know I have them.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.533
You worked with Haqqani
for decades.

29:42.616 --> 29:45.244
You knew his mind had changed.

29:45.327 --> 29:46.745
He wanted peace.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.705
What do you want?

29:49.748 --> 29:53.252
Anything that might
slow the trial.

29:53.335 --> 29:55.754
Anything that might prevent
the violence

29:55.838 --> 29:57.631
that would follow his execution.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.341
Oh.

29:59.424 --> 30:01.677
You want us to compromise
our sources.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.096
Yes.

30:04.179 --> 30:05.973
If that's what it takes.

30:08.267 --> 30:10.936
Haqqani's outlived
his usefulness to you.

30:11.019 --> 30:14.273
You think you don't care
if he dies.

30:14.356 --> 30:16.024
I'm telling you, you should.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.736
When those helicopters
went down,

30:19.820 --> 30:22.489
two things changed
in my country.

30:22.573 --> 30:25.492
An inexperienced president
came to power.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.619
The American people
were wounded,

30:27.703 --> 30:30.539
demanding action.

30:30.622 --> 30:34.459
We know what happens next.
We've been here before.

30:34.543 --> 30:37.045
How does a weak president
show he's strong?

30:38.881 --> 30:41.800
He goes to war.

30:41.884 --> 30:44.386
And that's what
will happen again,

30:44.469 --> 30:48.849
unless sensible people can
put aside their differences.

30:48.932 --> 30:50.893
You want us to work together?

30:50.976 --> 30:52.311
Yes.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.937

30:54.021 --> 30:56.857

invaded Afghanistan.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.984
BUNNY: We were friends then.

31:00.694 --> 31:03.906

when you needed us,

31:03.989 --> 31:06.158
friends again.

31:06.241 --> 31:09.411
In between,
not such good friends.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.662
You forget us.

31:10.746 --> 31:12.581
No, not forget.

31:12.664 --> 31:14.875
You'd lecture, belittle,

31:14.958 --> 31:18.128
withhold aid,
violate our borders,

31:18.212 --> 31:21.173
send your drones
to murder our citizens.

31:22.925 --> 31:24.927
BUNNY: Until you need our help,

31:25.010 --> 31:27.179
and then here you are,

31:27.262 --> 31:31.683
in my living room,
saying we're friends again.

31:31.767 --> 31:35.521
I thought you said,
in here, we tell the truth.

31:38.232 --> 31:40.234
If war starts in Afghanistan--

31:40.317 --> 31:43.779
You'll be burned, not us.

31:43.862 --> 31:47.199
We'll be hurt, yes.

31:47.282 --> 31:49.785
But we're 7,000 miles away.

31:51.286 --> 31:53.038
You live here.

31:54.957 --> 31:57.417

36:29.690 --> 36:31.733
bombed the Taliban to shit,
