WEBVTT

00:18.309 --> 00:20.562
THAT DAY…

00:27.819 --> 00:31.239
WAS JUST ANOTHER ORDINARY DAY

00:36.870 --> 00:39.497
-Can I have it as a set menu?
-It's not available…

00:39.581 --> 00:42.459
We have your drinks ready, ma'am.

00:44.335 --> 00:45.754
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.216
Hey, wait for me.
Don't watch it without me.

00:51.718 --> 00:52.886
Thank you.

00:52.969 --> 00:53.928
Firstly…

00:54.679 --> 00:57.182
an angel appears and prophecizes.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.935
The angel says
the name of the recipient first.

01:02.145 --> 01:05.774
They are then told when they will die
and that they are bound for Hell.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.485
When the time comes,

01:09.235 --> 01:13.865
the executors come from Hell
to fulfill the prophecy.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.161
If you're watching this
for the first time,

01:18.244 --> 01:19.621
you may find it shocking.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.414
He looks completely normal.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.917
But why is he talking nonsense?

01:24.584 --> 01:27.253
Does anyone even believe this bullshit?

01:27.337 --> 01:30.256
Lots of people believe this.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.051
Loads of videos
on his YouTube channel back it up.

01:33.551 --> 01:37.680
Come on. Con men like him can only exploit
people because idiots like you exist.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.850
Don't take this seriously, all right?

01:42.560 --> 01:45.522
Hey, don't tell me
you're already indoctrinated.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.523
What?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.733
Let's watch it again, then.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.193
This is all CGI.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.694
It's not.

01:56.866 --> 01:59.160
NOVEMBER 10, THURSDAY

02:13.800 --> 02:16.761
NOVEMBER 10, THURSDAY

02:38.283 --> 02:39.159
What's that?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.037
What's going on?

03:15.945 --> 03:17.155
Move!

03:18.364 --> 03:21.075
Damn it! Move out of my way!

03:21.159 --> 03:22.076
What the--

06:35.061 --> 06:36.562
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.199
-You punk!
-Stop, you bastard!

06:48.282 --> 06:49.867
-What the hell?
-Don't move!

06:49.951 --> 06:50.785
Damn.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.996
-You startled me. Take him away.
-It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

06:54.080 --> 06:55.289
Don't be too harsh.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.543
Damn, that startled me.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.090
We will now begin the case briefing

07:04.173 --> 07:07.343
on the Hapseong Station murder case.

07:08.219 --> 07:10.430
It occurred on November 10th, 2022.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.141
at a coffee shop near Hapseong Station.

07:13.224 --> 07:17.603
Some strange creatures appeared
out of nowhere and murdered the victim…

07:18.813 --> 07:20.064
The body ran…

07:20.148 --> 07:21.816
I mean, they burnt the body and ran.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.735
We are currently working on
tracking down the suspects.

07:25.736 --> 07:28.865
We have yet to find any evidence
at the scene.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.244
We still need to wait
for the full autopsy report,

07:33.744 --> 07:36.372
but it is clear that the body
was burnt to a crisp

07:36.456 --> 07:37.999
at a very high temperature.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.459
When did it start?

07:39.542 --> 07:43.379
-Just now.
-Here are the preliminary autopsy results.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.966
We do not have the full results yet,

07:48.050 --> 07:52.305
but the body seems to have been burnt at
a very high temperature in a short time.

07:52.388 --> 07:54.515
TRENDING: HELL, GOD, DEATH,
THE NEW TRUTH, ANGEL

07:54.599 --> 07:56.851
It's blowing up the Internet.

07:56.934 --> 07:59.645
The chief must be anxious as hell.

08:00.605 --> 08:01.814
…were able to identify him.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.692
Joo Myeonghun, age 36.

08:04.775 --> 08:08.237
He lived alone in an apartment
15 minutes away from the coffee shop.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.616
He divorced two years ago
and his ex-wife was his only family.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.035
He had no kids.

08:14.118 --> 08:16.078
It happened in broad daylight,

08:16.162 --> 08:19.081
so we've got tons of witnesses
and video evidence.

08:19.665 --> 08:20.875
Here's one of the clips.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.214
What is that?

08:28.716 --> 08:33.721
We can clearly see a strange creature
murdering the victim in this clip…

08:33.804 --> 08:34.639
What is that?

08:34.722 --> 08:37.934
…but we couldn't find
any physical evidence at the scene.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.523
"Jung Jinsu." "The New Truth"?
What are these?

08:43.606 --> 08:45.983
Kyunghun! Stop looking at your phone!

08:46.067 --> 08:47.401
He's going to cover it all!

08:47.902 --> 08:49.278
The New Truth.

08:49.362 --> 08:53.241
It was formed in 2012,
and it's recently become--

08:53.324 --> 08:54.283
That's enough.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.663
Everyone, listen.

08:58.746 --> 09:02.917
The media, the press, and the Internet…
They are all going wild over this case.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.919
You all need to do your job properly!

09:05.419 --> 09:08.422
Kids are already spreading
strange rumors about this case.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.883
But is it even human?

09:10.967 --> 09:11.884
Just bring it in!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.887
We'll find out what it is
once we have it in custody.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.640
Unit One, do some legwork
and find more about the victim.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.809
-Yes, sir.
-Unit Two, go check the scene.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.103
Question those who were
at the coffee shop.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.690
Make sure you don't give reporters
any info. They'll only spread rumors.

09:25.773 --> 09:28.317
-And Kyunghun.
-Yes, sir.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.737
Team up with Eunpyo
and find more about the New Truth.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.864
They are having a gathering
near the scene.

09:33.948 --> 09:37.118
It looks like those fanatics
are related to this case somehow.

09:37.201 --> 09:39.453
-You two, go check on them.
-Yes, sir.

09:39.537 --> 09:41.330
-Do not incite them.
-Okay.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.583
It's best not to mess
with religious groups.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.543
-Everyone, get to work!
-Yes, sir.

09:48.713 --> 09:49.714
Kyunghun.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.549
-Yes, sir.
-Come here.

09:57.555 --> 10:01.017
Feel free to let me know if you need
some time away from the field.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.771
I'm a detective. What else would I do?

10:05.855 --> 10:06.689
That's not…

10:08.357 --> 10:10.359
At least be on time, then.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.711
"The New Truth."

10:29.587 --> 10:33.090
"An organization for religious studies
formed by Chairman Jung Jinsu in 2012."

10:34.050 --> 10:36.177
The group hasn't been around long.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.554
Just a little over ten years.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.598
What are you reading?

10:41.265 --> 10:43.601
Oh, this? It's an online encyclopedia.

10:43.684 --> 10:44.810
You punk.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.481
"They have never disclosed
the exact number of members,

10:48.564 --> 10:52.401
but it is assumed that its radical members
formed the Arrowhead."

10:52.485 --> 10:54.278
What? The Arrowhead?

10:54.945 --> 10:57.698
You mean those psychos
who leak ex-cons' identities online?

10:57.782 --> 10:59.200
Are they part of the New Truth?

10:59.283 --> 11:03.829
From what I know,
the Arrowhead isn't just active online.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.416
I've heard of them
being involved in petty crimes.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.210
It says here

11:09.877 --> 11:14.757
that an angel-like figure appears
and tells you when you will go to Hell.

11:17.093 --> 11:21.597
"Hell" and "angel"? Are they saying
this is divine retribution?

11:21.681 --> 11:25.059
Yes. "An angel prophecizes
an individual's time of death,

11:25.142 --> 11:28.145
and when that time comes,
executors come up from Hell,

11:28.229 --> 11:31.190
demonstrate the pain of Hell
and disappear."

11:31.273 --> 11:34.610
They say it's some kind
of warning to the people.

11:34.694 --> 11:38.072
So are they saying
what we saw earlier is God's work?

11:38.155 --> 11:39.657
Their doctrine is full of holes,

11:39.740 --> 11:42.493
but people are attracted
by the video evidence they present.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.621
Kids learn everything
from videos these days.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.167
Whether it's God's work or not,
I hope it's true.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.086
Why do you say that?

11:52.169 --> 11:53.337
Think about it.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.925
Whenever we bring in all those
evil bastards who deserve death,

11:58.008 --> 12:01.429
the court lets them off
based on something trivial.

12:06.058 --> 12:06.934
Sorry.

12:07.768 --> 12:09.103
Our job is to catch them.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.814
Whether their victim is good or bad,

12:12.565 --> 12:15.109
whether they killed
to save the world or for fun…

12:15.693 --> 12:18.946
No matter what their reason is,
we're supposed to catch murderers.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.698
That's all we need to think about.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.037
Send backup to sector two and three.

12:32.084 --> 12:32.960
Open the gate.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.601
Patrol team moving to sector four.

12:55.274 --> 12:59.195
Code two-one moving to sector three.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.326
Patrol team report position. Patrol team…

13:05.409 --> 13:07.953
I didn't expect to see you at the scene.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.747
-Hey, Kyunghun.
-Hello.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.042
The damn team leader is on vacation.

13:14.001 --> 13:16.837
And since all eyes are on this case,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.714
I had to be here.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.593
Did you find anything?

13:22.676 --> 13:24.011
Nothing.

13:24.094 --> 13:27.723
The witness testified
that the creature excreted bodily fluids,

13:27.807 --> 13:29.266
but there's no trace.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.185
There aren't any footprints either.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.145
All we got were bloodstains.

13:33.938 --> 13:34.939
Look over there.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.691
They all belong to the victim.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.360
Oh dear.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.031
I heard the New Truth
is having a gathering here.

13:44.114 --> 13:44.990
Over there.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.743
Maybe that's them.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.247
They've been blabbering
into a microphone for a while.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.915
-See you, then.
-All right.

13:52.998 --> 13:53.958
See you later, sir.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.629
That sin signifies God's message.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.507
We need to listen
to God's voice, starting now.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.554
This person, who lived
in a village in South East Asia,

14:07.137 --> 14:09.932
had received a prophecy from an angel

14:10.432 --> 14:12.810
that he would go to Hell in five hours.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.727
Then…

14:13.811 --> 14:15.312
WHAT IS "GOD'S WILL"?

14:23.362 --> 14:26.198
This was filmed exactly five hours
after he received the prophecy.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.292
A few days later,

14:36.375 --> 14:39.336
three bodies were found buried
at the man's house.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.924
They were missing persons
from unsolved cases.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.388
This was taken seven years ago in Japan.

14:51.015 --> 14:54.018
This person had multiple counts
of fraud and assault.

14:55.603 --> 14:59.064
This was from Nicaragua six years ago.
Child exploitation and murder.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.942
At a glance, they look similar,

15:02.026 --> 15:04.904
and were all killed in the same way,
as you saw in the video.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.656
And they were all criminals.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.201
Manufacturing narcotics.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.454
Robbery and theft.

15:14.413 --> 15:15.289
Fraud.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.291
Rape, arson…

15:19.919 --> 15:21.503
Why do people sin?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.007
People who say they value humanity,

15:25.633 --> 15:27.843
above everything else,

15:28.510 --> 15:29.970
make excuses like this.

15:31.889 --> 15:33.557
Because they had a tough childhood,

15:34.058 --> 15:36.310
because of structural inequality,

15:36.393 --> 15:38.354
because they have a mental disorder,

15:38.854 --> 15:41.690
because they were under the influence
of drugs and alcohol.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.319
The concept of sin exists

15:46.487 --> 15:49.490
because humans choose to sin.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.159
As a result of denying that fact,

15:52.242 --> 15:54.745
we humans have forgotten
about shame, remorse,

15:54.828 --> 15:57.623
repentance, and redemption.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.753
God has found a way
to directly present to you

16:03.754 --> 16:06.966
what Hell is like.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.344
Why would God do this?

16:13.764 --> 16:17.518
He's telling us to be more righteous.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.568
Chairman Jung, you did great today.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.862
-Thank you. Safe trip back home.
-Thank you.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.614
Chairman Jung Jinsu?

16:33.659 --> 16:37.246
-Oh, I guess you are newcomers.
-We're from the police.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.000
Hello.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.043
Hello.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.338
What brings you here, Detectives?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.216
We're investigating the murder
that occurred over there today.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.760
-Murder case?
-Yes.

16:55.472 --> 16:57.808
I guess you're talking about
the demonstration.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.982
It's funny how you investigate
God's deeds.

17:06.483 --> 17:07.484
I understand.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.863
In your eyes, it's still a murder.

17:10.946 --> 17:13.657
Heejung, I got this. Give it to me.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.409
-Take a break.
-Thank you.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.120
Someone has died so we must investigate.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.455
So how may I help you?

17:20.247 --> 17:21.248
Well…

17:22.291 --> 17:23.917
-Heejung! Hey!
-Kyunghun.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.961
What are you doing here?

17:26.462 --> 17:28.756
Let go, Dad! Let go of me!

17:29.256 --> 17:32.342
Aren't you supposed to be at the academy?
What are you doing here?

17:32.426 --> 17:33.385
Hi, Heejung.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.387
It's been a while.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.264
You're so tall now.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.515
Hello.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.560
I'm on my way there now. Don't worry.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.812
Go straight home after class, all right?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.230
Okay, I got it.

17:46.940 --> 17:48.859
Chairman Jung, I'll get going.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.487
Okay. Bye, Heejung.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.239
Thank you for today.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.866
What do you think you're doing?

17:58.327 --> 18:00.996
Heejung once told me
that her father is in the police.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.290
What a coincidence.

18:03.373 --> 18:05.834
Does your organization
take advantage of minors?

18:05.918 --> 18:06.960
Of course not.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.880
I got to know her through volunteer work.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.342
Since you don't find it appropriate,

18:13.425 --> 18:16.470
I'll tell her to refrain
from volunteering from now on.

18:18.138 --> 18:20.140
Well, anyway,

18:20.224 --> 18:23.310
we'd like to ask you
a few questions regarding the case.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.188
I'm sorry,
but I have an interview scheduled.

18:26.271 --> 18:29.149
-Do you mind if I answer them on the way?
-Not at all.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.234
Shall we?

18:31.610 --> 18:33.153
Let's follow him for now.

18:39.743 --> 18:43.580
Thank you for waiting.
The train will be departing shortly.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.626
Is this how you usually commute,
Chairman Jung?

18:47.709 --> 18:49.837
You do not need to address me as Chairman.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.132
You can just call me by my name.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.885
The members helped me get a car,

18:56.969 --> 19:00.139
but I prefer to use public transit.

19:01.890 --> 19:02.933
I guess

19:04.226 --> 19:07.980
you expected me to be
some kind of cult leader.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.816
I'm not like that at all.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.070
I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.784
How can humans ever
fully understand God's work?

19:21.493 --> 19:23.787
Have you always been a believer?

19:24.413 --> 19:25.914
Not really.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.168
I grew up in a Catholic orphanage.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.253
Religion's always been part of my life.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.384
Chairman Jung!

19:38.051 --> 19:39.094
Please take my seat.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.555
No, it's okay. There's no need.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.266
Please, you should take this seat.

19:44.349 --> 19:45.350
No, thank you.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.936
Hey, that's Jung Jinsu.

19:48.020 --> 19:52.149
-Where? You're right, it is him.
-He's so cool.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.112
As I matured with age,

19:58.363 --> 20:00.240
I had always wanted to die.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.326
To tell you the truth,

20:03.619 --> 20:05.537
I had no interest in life.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.376
I was looking forward to turning 20,
wondering how to end my life.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.587
Why 20, specifically?

20:14.296 --> 20:17.174
Once you turn 20,
you get to leave the orphanage

20:17.257 --> 20:19.009
with some financial support.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.804
I was determined to end my life,

20:23.764 --> 20:26.975
but I didn't want people to see me dead.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.688
So I traveled to a plain in Tibet.

20:45.535 --> 20:49.873
There, vultures take care of dead bodies.

21:38.380 --> 21:42.884
That was the first time
I found meaning in life.

21:46.805 --> 21:50.183
Ever since, I traveled all over,
looking for traces of God.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.352
After traveling for ten years,

21:52.936 --> 21:55.355
I got to understand
God's will a little.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.616
And I realized what I was meant to do.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.619
Some people are saying that the New Truth

22:10.829 --> 22:13.415
is closely associated with the Arrowhead.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.878
I feel regretful about that claim.

22:19.546 --> 22:21.715
There are some people

22:21.798 --> 22:25.635
who misinterpret our doctrine
and have radical ideas.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.807
Letting the world know of God's wish
for us to live more righteously.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.685
That's our only goal.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.776
What's so funny?

22:41.318 --> 22:43.945
Living by performing good deeds
in fear of damnation…

22:45.614 --> 22:47.282
Can we call that just?

22:47.866 --> 22:50.577
Aside from fear,
what else makes people repent?

22:51.536 --> 22:53.455
Are you aware of anything else?

22:53.955 --> 22:55.749
According to you,

22:57.501 --> 23:00.796
this God must not believe
in humankind's free will.

23:03.131 --> 23:05.884
That's an interesting point,
Detective Jin.

23:07.886 --> 23:09.471
Free will…

23:09.554 --> 23:10.389
Right.

23:14.476 --> 23:15.769
I heard from Heejung

23:17.813 --> 23:21.400
that your wife was murdered.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.197
I can't begin to imagine
the pain you went through.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.118
What is the murderer doing now?

23:34.121 --> 23:37.874
Hasn't he been released back into society?

23:39.835 --> 23:44.631
Do you think that man-made laws
help justice be served?

23:47.717 --> 23:50.512
Do you think the murderer
feels any remorse?

23:51.763 --> 23:53.056
Chairman Jung?

23:55.142 --> 23:57.644
Hi, I'm here for your interview.

23:57.727 --> 23:58.603
Hello.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.486
That's my number.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.198
Please feel free to contact me
if you have any additional questions.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.366
Bye, then.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.622
-This way, please.
-Okay.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.417
Does he really live in there?

24:21.460 --> 24:23.086
He really is something.

24:26.715 --> 24:30.677
Did you expect a cult leader
to be ordinary?

25:05.462 --> 25:06.421
Heejung.

25:30.111 --> 25:32.489
Don't wash it.
I'm going to wear it tomorrow.

25:37.619 --> 25:38.912
We need to talk.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.332
I'm not a fanatic or anything.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.668
I attended a few of his lectures
out of curiosity.

25:44.751 --> 25:46.044
Don't worry.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.463
I haven't missed any school.

25:51.925 --> 25:52.926
Are we done?

26:10.151 --> 26:13.196
CHAIRMAN JUNG OF THE NEW TRUTH

26:40.557 --> 26:43.602
CHAIRMAN JUNG JINSU OF THE NEW TRUTH

26:43.685 --> 26:44.936
I heard from Heejung

26:47.188 --> 26:51.026
that your wife was murdered.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.573
I can't begin to imagine
the pain you went through.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.120
Do you think the murderer 
feels any remorse?

27:14.132 --> 27:17.302
REGENERATION AREA MURDER CASE

27:21.765 --> 27:24.893
Patrol cars, please set up a perimeter.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.402
Wait.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.862
-Let go of me!
-Wait.

27:39.741 --> 27:42.035
Let go of me, you bastards!

27:43.119 --> 27:44.245
-Get him.
-Get him!

27:44.329 --> 27:46.247
Let go, you jerk!

27:46.331 --> 27:47.374
Stop, Kyunghun.

27:47.457 --> 27:48.833
I told you not to come.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.918
Let go!

27:50.001 --> 27:52.003
Kyunghun, are you out of your mind?

27:52.087 --> 27:53.338
Let go!

27:54.047 --> 27:55.507
I'm her husband!

27:56.508 --> 27:57.967
Let me see her.

27:58.051 --> 27:59.928
Just let me see her!

28:00.011 --> 28:02.972
Let go! Let go of me!

28:12.941 --> 28:13.900
Honey.

28:19.155 --> 28:19.989
Kyunghun.

28:30.375 --> 28:32.752
CULPRIT OF THE REGENERATION AREA

28:34.587 --> 28:36.881
CULPRIT SUBJECTED TO DRUG TESTING

28:39.592 --> 28:41.344
LIGHT SENTENCE OF 10 YEARS SHOCKS PUBLIC

28:41.428 --> 28:44.639
-Why did you kill her?
-What was your motive?

28:46.224 --> 28:50.228
-When will he be imprisoned?
-Will the evidence be released?

28:50.311 --> 28:51.938
That's enough!

28:52.021 --> 28:54.941
-Please give us a comment.
-What was your motive?

29:00.989 --> 29:01.990
Go.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.700
Kyunghun, please.

29:04.868 --> 29:05.827
You should leave.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.997
You can't be here.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.206
Let go of me.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.417
Please, Kyunghun!

29:12.500 --> 29:13.460
Let go.

29:14.294 --> 29:15.545
Pull yourself together!

29:16.254 --> 29:17.756
Think about Heejung.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.550
You need to keep going.

29:21.718 --> 29:25.013
Think about your daughter! Kyunghun…

29:31.394 --> 29:32.729
How do you feel right now?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.983
-Do you feel any remorse?
-You have to get through this.

29:37.692 --> 29:38.651
Kyunghun…

29:42.322 --> 29:45.575
POSITIVE DRUG TEST RESULT LED TO
MITIGATED PUNISHMENT FOR THE MURDERER

29:49.162 --> 29:51.498
CULPRIT OF THE REGENERATION AREA
MURDER CASE

29:51.581 --> 29:53.458
RELEASED FROM PRISON AFTER 6 YEARS

30:22.695 --> 30:24.113
I'm going home.

30:24.197 --> 30:26.783
How come you're going home early?

30:26.866 --> 30:29.536
It's been a slow day.
I'll see you tomorrow.

30:31.287 --> 30:34.207
I should close early and go home too.

30:57.105 --> 30:57.981
Hurry up.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.024
Oh my, Eunyul.

31:00.775 --> 31:02.735
Why are you still up?

31:04.279 --> 31:05.280
Surprise!

31:05.363 --> 31:07.824
Happy birthday to you

31:07.907 --> 31:11.494
-Hayul, you're still up too?
-Happy birthday to you

31:11.578 --> 31:15.123
Happy birthday, dear Mom

31:15.206 --> 31:18.626
Happy birthday to you

31:19.544 --> 31:20.879
Blow them out.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.426
Thank you, Hayul.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.220
Thank you.

31:30.555 --> 31:31.848
Thank you, Eunyul.

31:35.894 --> 31:36.728
Mom.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.568
Park Jungja.

31:44.402 --> 31:49.324
You will die five days from now

31:49.407 --> 31:51.367
at 3:00 p.m.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.495
And…

31:55.079 --> 31:59.876
you are bound for Hell.

32:01.419 --> 32:03.212
Finally!

32:03.296 --> 32:09.761
God has demonstrated His damnation
here in Seoul, South Korea!

32:09.844 --> 32:12.430
Humans have refused
to understand God's will

32:12.513 --> 32:15.433
no matter how relentless He has been
in His pursuit of us.

32:15.516 --> 32:17.310
Like spoon-feeding.

32:17.393 --> 32:20.188
In Seoul, a city of ten million people.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.691
In broad daylight!

32:24.484 --> 32:26.444
But look how people are reacting.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.072
"Cult"? "Terrorism"? "Special effects"?

32:29.155 --> 32:31.574
You hopeless shits!

32:31.658 --> 32:34.994
What else do they need
to see to believe it?

32:35.078 --> 32:35.954
Huh?!

32:39.499 --> 32:41.960
They launched an investigation.

32:42.043 --> 32:42.919
Isn't that crazy?

32:43.002 --> 32:46.297
Do they investigate a judge
when they sentence someone to death?

32:46.381 --> 32:52.178
Are they going to go up to God and say,
"You are under arrest for murder"?

32:52.762 --> 32:53.763
Listen to me.

32:53.846 --> 32:57.016
What do you think the police
should be doing right now?

32:57.100 --> 32:58.184
Joo Myeonghun!

32:58.267 --> 33:01.145
They need to find out what his sins are!

33:01.229 --> 33:05.358
They need to show people
that not a single person in this world

33:05.441 --> 33:08.820
can ever avoid God's judgment!

33:09.821 --> 33:10.989
By the way,

33:11.072 --> 33:17.078
why do you think God demonstrated
damnation here in Seoul?

33:18.037 --> 33:19.539
It's because we are here.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.250
We,

33:22.750 --> 33:23.960
the Arrowhead!

33:24.043 --> 33:26.129
The Arrowhead!

33:26.212 --> 33:29.674
When God releases an arrow,
we, the Arrowhead, should fly

33:29.757 --> 33:31.384
and hit the target.

33:31.467 --> 33:32.635
And what's our target?

33:36.055 --> 33:38.182
I hate this shit! Disgusting!

33:38.266 --> 33:42.478
Let's listen to this novelist
named Kim Gwangjin talking bullshit.

33:42.562 --> 33:43.730
You bastard!

33:43.813 --> 33:47.025
As the public's trust
in the government declines,

33:47.108 --> 33:50.319
people are drawn to personal revenge.

33:50.903 --> 33:53.948
Some people are trying
to find meaning in these events

33:54.032 --> 33:55.950
and say justice is being served.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.119
And many people are buying into it.

33:58.202 --> 34:04.125
This reminds me of the terrible violence
that happened in medieval theocracy.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.170
Once you let others control your thoughts…

34:09.589 --> 34:11.549
"Thoughts"? Did I just hear him right?

34:11.632 --> 34:14.093
You shouldn't think
for yourself, you dipshit.

34:14.177 --> 34:16.137
What gives you the right
to have an opinion?

34:16.220 --> 34:18.890
God has kindly shown us His will!

34:18.973 --> 34:24.854
I assure you that you
are bound for Hell soon!

34:24.937 --> 34:26.105
Remember, everyone.

34:26.689 --> 34:31.110
What God truly wants from us
is not to wait until His punishment.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.488
Once God lets us know where we should go,

34:33.571 --> 34:35.156
we must head in that direction.

34:35.239 --> 34:39.160
That's the free will
that God has granted us.

34:39.243 --> 34:40.161
That's why

34:40.828 --> 34:42.830
the Arrowhead exists.

34:43.414 --> 34:48.002
Now, it's time for me to show you
our accomplishments.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.879
I'm so excited!

34:51.631 --> 34:52.757
Beat him up!

34:55.259 --> 34:56.511
Please don't kill me.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.430
Please don't kill me. I have a family.

34:59.514 --> 35:00.932
Shut the fuck up!

35:01.015 --> 35:04.477
Hey, why did you do that?

35:04.560 --> 35:08.272
Did you think blabbering like that
would make you look smart or something?

35:08.356 --> 35:09.857
-I'm sorry.
-You like that?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.275
You fucker!

35:11.359 --> 35:13.111
Ask for forgiveness!

35:13.194 --> 35:15.655
I'm sorry.

35:16.697 --> 35:21.869
I denied God… I mean, I denied God's will.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.289
-I thought of pursuing worldly values.
-Boring.

35:25.373 --> 35:27.625
-I valued them above all--
-I can't hear you.

35:29.627 --> 35:31.337
Come to your senses!

35:31.420 --> 35:33.631
Look at him trying to look cool.

35:33.714 --> 35:34.841
Beat him!

35:36.717 --> 35:38.261
I'm gonna beat him up.

35:39.178 --> 35:41.806
METHOD_44: THAT LOOKS LIKE KIM GWANGJIN
ARROWFIRE: ARROWHEAD SWAG

35:42.306 --> 35:44.058
Who cares about your opinion?

35:44.142 --> 35:48.062
Admit that you just wanted to look cool
and ask for God's forgiveness!

35:48.146 --> 35:50.356
-That's right.
-I'm so sorry.

35:51.023 --> 35:53.943
-I just wanted to sound smart.
-We can't hear you.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.069
I'm so sorry.

35:55.153 --> 35:58.739
I should've known my place
and kept my mouth shut.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.159
Please don't kill me.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.079
I'm so sorry.

36:06.956 --> 36:08.207
Great job!

36:08.791 --> 36:11.169
Well, he didn't even thank us

36:11.252 --> 36:13.296
for putting him back on the right path,

36:13.379 --> 36:16.007
but we have more important things to do.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.925
We'll let this one go.

36:18.009 --> 36:22.180
The more important matter
we should care about is

36:22.263 --> 36:23.598
Joo Myeonghun!

36:23.681 --> 36:26.976
We should find out all the evil deeds
this sinner has done,

36:27.059 --> 36:29.478
and let the world know what God's will is.

36:29.562 --> 36:33.608
That is it for today's broadcast!

36:33.691 --> 36:38.696
The Arrowhead!

36:46.829 --> 36:49.123
Hi, Detective Jin. Good morning.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.626
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

36:51.709 --> 36:55.087
About Joo Myeonghun, the victim
of the Hapseong Station murder case…

36:55.171 --> 36:56.923
I don't know anything.

36:57.006 --> 36:59.967
Don't be like that, Detective Jin.
Does he have any priors?

37:00.051 --> 37:02.136
I don't know. That's all I can tell you.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.931
Why do you want to know
about a dead man's criminal record?

37:05.014 --> 37:08.100
Everyone on the Internet is trying
to find out why he was damned.

37:08.684 --> 37:11.312
Shouldn't the press correct the fake news?

37:11.395 --> 37:13.564
This is why people
never respect reporters.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.359
As if they respect the police.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.528
Anyway, let me know
if you find anything, all right?

37:19.612 --> 37:20.696
Call me!

37:21.280 --> 37:22.323
Joo Myeonghun?

37:23.407 --> 37:24.492
Listen.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.787
How can we investigate
when there's nothing to convict?

37:27.870 --> 37:32.208
I get what you mean,
but that's not how filing a claim works.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.294
What do you mean
we should investigate the victim?

37:35.378 --> 37:38.673
If there's anything we should investigate,

37:38.756 --> 37:40.967
you should file a police report.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.134
Hello?

37:43.636 --> 37:46.305
What's going on?
What are these calls about?

37:46.389 --> 37:48.683
That skull mask guy
must have a lot of sources.

37:48.766 --> 37:50.851
He even exposed
the identity of the victim.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.103
What about those kids?

37:52.186 --> 37:55.022
We arrested some of them
but they're refusing to testify.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.524
Was that a live broadcast?

37:56.607 --> 37:58.985
Those reckless little punks.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.737
I don't know if those teenagers
are fearless or stupid.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.865
What about the novelist? How is he?

38:04.949 --> 38:08.035
Over there. He's here
with his lawyer for the statement.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.954
I guess he doesn't need hospitalization.

38:14.667 --> 38:17.628
All right. Talk to those kids with Wonpil.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.463
I'll talk to the victim.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.049
We should've brought in
the skull mask guy.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.968
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

38:27.096 --> 38:27.930
Hello.

38:29.515 --> 38:31.517
I'm Assistant Inspector Jin Kyunghun.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.936
I'm Min Hyejin of Sodo Law Firm.

38:36.522 --> 38:37.815
It's not that high.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.358
I'm so freaking hungry.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.986
Hey, I think we can just jump off.

38:42.069 --> 38:43.612
Get down, dumbass.

38:43.696 --> 38:44.905
Crazy bastard.

38:45.948 --> 38:47.825
Hey, it's the pigs.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.076
You punks,

38:49.160 --> 38:51.203
did you forget why you're here?

38:52.913 --> 38:53.998
These little shits…

38:54.081 --> 38:56.125
-Wonpil, they're just kids.
-So damn cool.

38:56.208 --> 38:59.962
Behave and don't get on our nerves.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.883
Are they playing
good cop, bad cop with us?

39:03.966 --> 39:05.676
Shut up, you shithead.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.803
-Don't fucking talk to me.
-Why so serious?

39:07.887 --> 39:08.971
Seriously.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.015
I had a lecture,

39:11.724 --> 39:15.061
so I was on my way
to the underground parking lot.

39:16.145 --> 39:17.813
They attacked me out of nowhere.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.859
I think I passed out
after being hit in the head.

39:22.401 --> 39:25.029
When I woke, I was tied up.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.323
Well, do you remember how many there were?

39:28.699 --> 39:29.575
I think

39:30.326 --> 39:32.244
there were more than ten of them.

39:33.162 --> 39:36.624
By the way, did you arrest them all?

39:37.124 --> 39:39.668
Well, almost.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.171
I'm afraid most of them

39:43.255 --> 39:44.507
are minors.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.011
Okay, listen.

39:50.012 --> 39:53.265
You may think you aren't subject
to prosecution because you're minors,

39:53.349 --> 39:56.310
but you're old enough to be penalized
under juvenile criminal law.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.521
What? What are we supposed to do?

40:00.689 --> 40:02.733
If you want to mitigate your punishment,

40:02.817 --> 40:06.112
you'd better give me the names
of all those who were involved.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.738
Hello, juvenile court!

40:08.948 --> 40:10.157
Hey,

40:10.241 --> 40:12.701
Mr. Po-po is being serious. Look at him.

40:13.285 --> 40:14.120
Mister,

40:14.703 --> 40:18.541
do you think the world will be the same
by the time we go to court?

40:18.624 --> 40:21.085
Can't you see that the world is changing?

40:21.168 --> 40:23.838
Don't you know you go to Hell
if you do something bad?

40:23.921 --> 40:26.298
You guys have done something really bad!

40:29.301 --> 40:30.344
Mister,

40:31.053 --> 40:34.140
do you think you know
more about sin than us?

40:35.182 --> 40:39.353
Have you ever read about God's will
stated in the New Truth doctrine?

40:42.356 --> 40:44.233
I hope you don't think

40:44.316 --> 40:47.820
this is just another crime
committed by reckless teenagers.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.364
This is just the beginning.

40:50.906 --> 40:56.495
As a person who has been following
the crimes committed by the Arrowhead,

40:56.579 --> 41:00.666
I assure you that those religious fanatics
can do much worse for their cause.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.711
We really don't have any idea

41:03.794 --> 41:05.754
how we should deal with what's to come.

41:06.380 --> 41:07.923
We also think

41:08.007 --> 41:11.719
this case is different from other crimes
committed by the Arrowhead.

41:15.514 --> 41:16.640
Please contact me

41:17.391 --> 41:19.393
if you find anything strange

41:20.060 --> 41:23.981
or if anything new surfaces
about the New Truth or the Arrowhead.

41:24.648 --> 41:25.483
Sure.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.943
Wait, Detective Jin.

41:28.903 --> 41:31.238
So, those strange creatures…

41:32.198 --> 41:34.450
Did you find out what they are?

41:35.326 --> 41:39.872
Are they really sent by God?

41:52.635 --> 41:54.553
Those punks aren't budging.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.224
They must believe
that the world has come to an end.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.976
Actually, what was the word they used?

42:01.727 --> 42:02.645
Was it "complete"?

42:03.145 --> 42:05.940
Oh, they said it’s becoming whole.

42:07.107 --> 42:09.401
How did it go with Heejung? Is it serious?

42:10.194 --> 42:11.987
Well, I wouldn't say that.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.662
She smiled.

42:19.745 --> 42:22.456
That's good. Doesn't that mean
things are getting better?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.333
Something doesn't feel right.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.586
I have no idea how she really feels.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.298
I can never figure her out.

42:31.382 --> 42:33.592
That's what it's like
being the parent of a teenager.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.220
Just think of it as a good sign
when she's smiling.

42:47.398 --> 42:50.776
SODO LAW FIRM

42:50.859 --> 42:51.944
Hello?

42:52.027 --> 42:52.987
GET LOST
WE MUST REPENT

42:53.070 --> 42:55.948
I'm almost there.
I'm walking up the stairs.

42:56.031 --> 42:57.408
What's the rush?

42:57.491 --> 42:59.535
WE MUST REPENT
JUST DIE

42:59.618 --> 43:01.704
I WILL GET YOU SOON

43:01.787 --> 43:02.621
What?

43:03.581 --> 43:04.456
Who?

43:05.374 --> 43:06.584
Who did you say is here?

43:06.667 --> 43:08.502
DEMONS
DEMON'S TONGUE BOUND FOR HELL

43:08.586 --> 43:09.837
What's wrong with him?

43:09.920 --> 43:12.715
KNOW YOUR PLACE

43:13.382 --> 43:17.261
Minyong, can we remove
the graffiti on the wall?

43:17.344 --> 43:18.596
-Okay.
-Hyejin.

43:18.679 --> 43:21.849
-That's not important. Get in there.
-What's wrong? Who is it?

43:30.149 --> 43:31.358
Hello, Ms. Min.

43:32.651 --> 43:33.485
Hello.

43:34.278 --> 43:37.031
I'm Min Hyejin. I heard you asked for me.

43:37.698 --> 43:38.532
I did.

43:39.575 --> 43:40.659
Hello.

43:41.410 --> 43:42.369
Well,

43:44.288 --> 43:45.789
I'm bound for Hell, so…

43:46.498 --> 43:47.333
Pardon?

43:49.501 --> 43:50.919
I'm bound for Hell.

43:51.503 --> 43:52.379
Hell?

43:52.463 --> 43:53.714
-Show her.
-Okay.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.050
Here.

43:57.843 --> 44:00.012
Mom, look.

44:04.308 --> 44:07.061
Park Jungja.

44:07.728 --> 44:11.106
-You will die five days from now.
-What is this?

44:11.190 --> 44:14.443
-At 3:00 p.m.
-It's a decree.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.946
-I'm sorry?
-They said that's what it's called.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.575
The New Truth told me
that I received a decree.

44:22.785 --> 44:23.744
I see.

44:24.870 --> 44:25.996
The New Truth?

44:26.580 --> 44:29.500
My son said they would know best
regarding this matter.

44:48.435 --> 44:49.812
So what did they say?

44:51.355 --> 44:53.023
They said they'd like to broadcast it.

44:53.565 --> 44:55.609
You know, the demonstration.

44:55.693 --> 44:56.527
Pardon?

44:57.653 --> 45:01.031
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.
What did they say again?

45:02.032 --> 45:03.992
They'd like to do a live broadcast

45:05.202 --> 45:06.745
of the moment I go to Hell.

45:07.496 --> 45:08.956
Those crazy freaks!
