- [soldier screams]

00:04.874 --> 00:06.963
[sword whooshes]

00:09.313 --> 00:11.794
I saw Makee on Sanctuary.

00:11.881 --> 00:13.361
- Makee's dead.
- I know.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.319
I shot her myself.

00:15.406 --> 00:17.452
[Ackerson] <i>Your account
of events on Sanctuary</i>

00:17.539 --> 00:19.280
<i>has proven dubious.</i>

00:19.367 --> 00:22.152
I know how you assholes think.
I was you once.

00:22.239 --> 00:25.112
There's other things to be,
other ways to live.

00:25.199 --> 00:27.201
- [Riz grunting]
- [John] Don't you quit.

00:27.288 --> 00:29.159
Get up.

00:29.246 --> 00:31.292
I know the location
of Catherine Halsey.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.989
It's not about the money
for you, is it?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.383
It's about what she did to ya.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.820
Soren never would've
left any of you behind.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.170
[Ackerson]
You're under arrest.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.867
[Woman] Ruby Ann
bought Soren's crew.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.652
[Kessler] When my dad comes
back, he'll protect us.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.698
He's not coming back!

00:46.785 --> 00:49.310
I want to introduce
you to someone.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.095
This is Julia.
She'll be your attendant.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.227
Where is she?

00:53.314 --> 00:55.490
Cortana, she's secure.

00:55.577 --> 00:58.754
<i>Have you made any progress
with the problem I gave you?</i>

00:58.841 --> 01:01.409
<i>All of my simulations
returned the same result,</i>

01:01.496 --> 01:03.976
<i>regardless of any action taken.</i>

01:04.064 --> 01:06.022
So there's nothing to be done.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.719
I was scanning the band,

01:07.806 --> 01:10.418
and I heard something
in the interference.

01:10.505 --> 01:11.506
[Elite roars]

01:11.593 --> 01:12.942
[John] You heard a message.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.639
This will happen again.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.119
I want you to post your evidence

01:16.206 --> 01:18.165
of the Covenant's
other activities.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.210
Press the button,
and I'll find you.

01:20.297 --> 01:22.256
This new guy, he's got
us escorting a tech team

01:22.343 --> 01:24.214
on some fix-it mission.

01:24.301 --> 01:25.694
<i>If you're sending Cobalt
to another comms array,</i>

01:25.781 --> 01:27.913
you better tell them
to expect the Covenant.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.959
I cannot authorize Silver Team

01:30.046 --> 01:31.569
to perform combat operations.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.094
[computer beeping]

01:34.181 --> 01:36.487
[rockets whooshing]

01:36.574 --> 01:39.142
- We're cleared for combat?
- Affirmative.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.928
[Kai] What exactly
is the mission?

01:44.626 --> 01:46.497
The Covenant's on Reach.

01:46.584 --> 01:48.108
[screaming]

01:48.195 --> 01:49.979
- [door crashes open]
- [sinister noises]

01:55.289 --> 01:58.205

02:05.951 --> 02:07.257
Seven clicks to target.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.175
[faint creaking sound]

02:13.916 --> 02:16.092
Riz?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.442
[Riz] <i>Cobalt Three, Romeo,
this is Silver Three, over.</i>

02:18.529 --> 02:20.357
[static crackling]

02:20.444 --> 02:22.490
<i>Any Cobalt element,
this is Silver Three.</i>

02:22.577 --> 02:24.796
<i>We are en route to your
position, how copy?</i>

02:24.883 --> 02:29.236
- [static crackles]
- [John] Try the relay.

02:29.323 --> 02:31.368
[Riz] <i>Visegrád Relay,
this is Silver Three.</i>

02:31.455 --> 02:34.284
<i>- Radio check, over.</i>
- [static crackling]

02:34.371 --> 02:35.938
[Kai] We getting
air support for this?

02:36.025 --> 02:37.461
[Riz] <i>Visegrád Relay,
this is Silver Three.</i>

02:37.548 --> 02:38.810
[Kai] Where is everybody?

02:38.897 --> 02:41.465
<i>- Over.</i>
- We're on our own.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.859
FLEETCOM doesn't believe
the Covenant's on Reach.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.209
They just think
Cobalt's missing.

02:46.296 --> 02:48.037
This is a search
and rescue mission,

02:48.124 --> 02:50.039
but we need to be prepared
for the possibility

02:50.126 --> 02:51.649
that Cobalt ran into something.

02:51.736 --> 02:54.086
[Vannak] Something Covenant?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.524
[John] Command thinks
this planet's untouchable.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.613
They haven't
seen what we've seen,

02:58.700 --> 03:00.745
and they don't
know what we know.

03:00.832 --> 03:03.183
I'll tell you this,
we will have contact.

03:03.270 --> 03:06.447
Until then, it's just us.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.234
[Kai] This seem right to you?

03:12.366 --> 03:13.454
[Vannak grunts softly]

03:28.556 --> 03:31.298

05:18.927 --> 05:21.495
[clanking footsteps]

05:25.412 --> 05:27.457
[John] See if you
can get the power up.

05:27.544 --> 05:28.632
[Riz] Copy, Chief.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.553
[Vannak] Left in a hurry.

05:36.640 --> 05:40.209
No sign of Cobalt,
no breach marks at the--

05:40.296 --> 05:42.907
[pulse blaring]

05:44.039 --> 05:46.607

[thunderous rumble]

05:58.488 --> 05:59.794
[sudden silence]

05:59.881 --> 06:01.796
[Kai] What the hell was that?

06:01.883 --> 06:03.624
[Riz] I don't know, I've
never heard anything like it.

06:03.711 --> 06:06.975
[John] I have, on Sanctuary.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.153
[heavy clank]

06:11.240 --> 06:15.592
[steady pounding on doors]

06:15.679 --> 06:17.942
[Vannak] You believe him now?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.988
[steady pounding continues]

06:27.778 --> 06:30.433
[finger tapping]

07:03.597 --> 07:04.946
[distorted audio]

07:13.389 --> 07:16.348
[Briggs]
Stand down!

07:16.436 --> 07:19.003
Tell your team to lower
their weapons, Master Chief.

07:19.090 --> 07:20.744
[Vannak] What is this?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.703
- Chief?
- Now.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.228
I can't even describe
the amount of shit you're in.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.490
[Kai] I can't even describe

07:27.577 --> 07:29.144
what's about to
happen to your face.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.450
[Vannak] Who the hell
are these people?

07:30.537 --> 07:32.190
I carry priority
orders from FLEETCOM.

07:32.277 --> 07:33.583
- What orders?
- To bring you in.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.456
[John] You are impeding
my mission, move.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.327
There is no mission.

07:38.414 --> 07:40.895
- You stole a Condor.
- What?

07:40.982 --> 07:43.245
- Falsified a flight plan.
- What is she talking about?

07:43.332 --> 07:45.421
You're not even authorized to
be in those suits right now,

07:45.508 --> 07:47.162
let alone pointing
a gun at my face.

07:47.249 --> 07:50.252
So stand down, or
we will engage you.

07:50.339 --> 07:51.296
[Riz] Good luck with that.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.733
[Vannak] Chief, what do we do?

07:54.822 --> 07:56.954
[John] Where is Cobalt Team?

07:57.041 --> 07:59.261
- Last chance.
- John.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.263
[John] Tell me where Cobalt is,
or I'm going through that door.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.134
[Briggs] I gave you an order.

08:03.221 --> 08:04.571
[Vannak] What's the call?

08:06.007 --> 08:07.269
Chief?

08:07.356 --> 08:09.532
[steady pounding on doors]

08:12.317 --> 08:15.669
[Briggs] Ah, stand
down, do not fire!

08:18.367 --> 08:20.543
- Chief.
- They were here.

08:21.849 --> 08:22.893
I can prove it.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.765
[Kai sighs]

08:26.854 --> 08:28.420
[Kai] Not like this.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.858
[somber music]

08:36.559 --> 08:38.648
We were a thousand feet up,

08:38.735 --> 08:42.260
wind whipping, cables groaning.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.349
Couldn't have been more
than two degrees up there.

08:44.436 --> 08:48.397
- January, you know?
- Yeah.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.965
And I can't hold it anymore.

08:51.052 --> 08:53.968
I'm strapped in the
harness, and I look down,

08:54.055 --> 08:56.536
I tell Arthur,
I say, "I gotta go."

08:56.623 --> 08:59.190
[laughs]
What's he gonna do?

08:59.277 --> 09:00.496
You peed on Uncle Arthur?

09:00.583 --> 09:03.978
I peed on him.
What could he do?

09:04.065 --> 09:06.720
Okay, lift your chin up, yeah.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.204
What the hell's wrong with you?

09:13.291 --> 09:15.032
This shit is funny.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.251
Well, I've heard it before.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.035
What difference does that make?

09:18.122 --> 09:22.431
You're supposed to damn well
laugh when I repeat myself.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.346
I'm the one that's senile.

09:24.433 --> 09:25.782
I don't know what you're
complaining about.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.044
I'm not complaining.

09:27.131 --> 09:30.134
Well, I mean, you want to.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.484
What is it?

09:32.572 --> 09:34.704
Your secret's safe with me.

09:36.097 --> 09:37.707
Is this about that thing

09:37.794 --> 09:40.231
that you weren't
supposed to tell me?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.016
You weren't supposed
to remember.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.888
I don't choose what I forget.

09:47.369 --> 09:49.110
I might have to go away.

09:50.981 --> 09:52.374
Where?

09:52.461 --> 09:55.899
And I can't take you with me.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.771
[somber music]

09:59.120 --> 10:03.907
- I know.
- I want to, but I can't.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.564
You see that bridge?

10:08.651 --> 10:09.957
[Ackerson] I can't stop it, Dad.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.480
You know who built that bridge?

10:11.567 --> 10:13.700
It's not up to me.

10:13.787 --> 10:15.440
- It's too late.
- I built that bridge.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.879
Me and your Uncle Arthur.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.794
The day it was finished,

10:20.881 --> 10:25.059
I walked across it with
your mum, and your sister.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.845
She couldn't have
been more than 3.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.414
Held her little hand.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.850
She wouldn't let me pick her up.

10:33.937 --> 10:37.811
She wanted to walk
the whole way.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.553
Yeah.
[chuckles]

10:41.641 --> 10:43.686
All right.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.209
So when's she coming?

10:47.081 --> 10:48.212
Your sister.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.827
She's gone, Dad.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.221
Julia's gone.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.919
Mum, too.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.229
Oh.

11:05.316 --> 11:08.885
- It's just you and me.
- I know that.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.234
I damn well know that.

11:10.321 --> 11:12.236
Don't think that
I don't know that.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.981
Oh, sorry.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.156
[Ackerson] It's okay.

11:21.202 --> 11:26.033
Sorry, I just, sorry,
I just get confused sometimes.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.861
It's okay.

11:30.254 --> 11:34.737
Doesn't mean that I
don't know what's real.

11:37.827 --> 11:41.004
See you tomorrow, okay?

11:41.091 --> 11:41.831
Okay.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.271
- Promise me...
- Yeah, I promise.

11:47.358 --> 11:51.275
No, promise me you won't
let them take me alive.

Sir.

12:10.904 --> 12:13.428
I'm looking at 15
infractions of the UCMJ,

one of which involves
pointing a loaded weapon

12:15.604 --> 12:16.561
in the face of an officer?

12:16.648 --> 12:17.649
I did that, sir.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.521
Sir, I had credible information.

12:19.608 --> 12:23.525
You had a feeling.
You had a delusion.

12:25.309 --> 12:26.746
You went outside the chain.

Didn't ya?

Yes, sir.

it's not your job to know.

Four days ago, Cobalt
was deployed to Aktis IV.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.964
No, this isn't right.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.619
I saw Cobalt's flight plan.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.665
- [Vannak] Chief.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.652
Rack your suits, dismissed.

13:52.179 --> 13:54.572
Did you even try to defend us?

13:54.659 --> 13:58.098
I'm the only reason you're
not facing a court-martial.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.540
You lied to us.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.324
I told you what you needed to
know to complete the mission.

14:07.411 --> 14:10.284
- There was no mission.
- Cobalt was at Visegrád.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.938
- Chief, can I talk to you?
- This is ONI, all of it.

14:12.025 --> 14:14.505
- This is Ackerson.
- Come on, Chief.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.203
- Why do you think he's here?
- I can't listen to this.

14:16.290 --> 14:17.987
Where do you think you're going?

14:18.770 --> 14:19.946
Vannak!

14:20.033 --> 14:21.948
- You are out of control.
- What?

14:22.035 --> 14:23.645
You're not thinking
straight, you're erratic.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.343
Since when do you
question my judgment?

14:26.430 --> 14:30.260
Since you started
seeing dead people.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.960
I didn't tell anyone you said
you saw Makee on Sanctuary.

14:34.047 --> 14:38.051
John, I'm trying to help you.

14:38.138 --> 14:40.401
I'm trying to talk to you,
as your friend.

14:40.488 --> 14:44.622
I don't need a friend,
Petty Officer, I need a Spartan.

14:44.709 --> 14:46.015
Why don't you try doing that?

14:49.192 --> 14:51.673
125, you are not dismissed!

14:51.760 --> 14:54.284
[somber music]

15:03.598 --> 15:05.948
[indistinct chatter]

15:08.342 --> 15:09.604
[man] Hey!

15:13.913 --> 15:17.525
[liquid burbling]

15:17.612 --> 15:20.876
[suspenseful music]

15:27.752 --> 15:30.407
[Person] Who is she?

15:30.494 --> 15:32.148
[Laera gasps]

15:32.235 --> 15:33.845
[both grunting]

15:33.933 --> 15:36.196
[knife zings]

15:36.283 --> 15:38.502
- [knife clatters]
- [Laera coughing]

15:38.589 --> 15:41.201
[Laera panting]

15:42.506 --> 15:43.855
- Kwan?
- Shh!

15:43.943 --> 15:46.554
[nearby voices]

15:48.382 --> 15:49.818
What're you doing?

15:49.905 --> 15:51.428
- You're in danger.
- I can see that.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.864
Not from Ruby Ann.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.866
I'm talking about your crew.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.564
[eerie music]

15:56.651 --> 15:58.958
Ruby Ann bought them off.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.003
- They got rid of Soren.
- What?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.787
- You're next.
- What?

16:04.224 --> 16:06.966
- Is Soren--
- I don't know.

16:07.053 --> 16:09.794
You have to get Kessler and go.

16:09.881 --> 16:13.885
[imitating gunfire]

16:19.543 --> 16:22.416
- Come on, man, I got you.
- Did not.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.374
Are you kidding me,
at this range?

16:24.461 --> 16:26.855
- Come on, man.
- It's Master Chief.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.248
[Antares] Yeah,
it's Master Chief,

16:28.335 --> 16:29.771
in eight different pieces.

16:29.858 --> 16:30.946
[Kessler] Nope, nope,
you missed.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.948
[Antares] Fine.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.819
[Laera]
What are you doing here?

16:35.777 --> 16:37.997
Playing.

16:38.084 --> 16:38.998
We have good news.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.739
Ship's fixed.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.220
We can leave.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.396
You said it would
take a couple of days.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.137
It's Soren.

16:48.224 --> 16:51.793
- We worked all night.
- Come here.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.925
- We're not finished.
- Kessler.

16:56.798 --> 16:59.105
[Kessler sighs]

17:00.802 --> 17:02.064
Time to go.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.545
Can I come?

17:04.632 --> 17:06.242
- Yeah.
- No.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.200
Everybody goes.

17:09.506 --> 17:11.421
We're all family.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.988
You go ahead, I'll
meet you at the ship.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.642
We can wait.

17:14.729 --> 17:18.211
Don't trouble
yourselves, I can manage.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.519
- Carina.
- It's no trouble.

17:24.391 --> 17:25.914
[Antares] Carina.

17:27.872 --> 17:28.960
Come on.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.746
[tense music]

17:41.582 --> 17:44.237
[ominous music]

17:52.636 --> 17:53.898
Get your things.

18:00.514 --> 18:03.343
[Kessler] Kwan,
you can come out.

18:04.866 --> 18:08.130
[emotional music]

18:17.879 --> 18:19.968
[John groans]

18:20.055 --> 18:22.710
So, when you guys joined ONI,
is this what you had in mind?

18:22.797 --> 18:25.147
We don't like this any
more than you do, Chief.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.420
[John] If you get any closer,

18:37.507 --> 18:38.987
we're gonna have to
talk about our feelings.

18:39.074 --> 18:39.944
[Guard] It's just a routine
psych eval, Chief.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.817
[doors swoosh]

18:46.777 --> 18:47.735
[doors close firmly]

18:47.822 --> 18:49.780
[elevator whirring]

18:49.867 --> 18:52.522
- Sorry.
- What?

18:52.609 --> 18:55.525
[guards grunting]

18:55.612 --> 18:59.312
[tense music]

19:01.923 --> 19:06.275
- [door clicks]
- [pleasant music]

19:06.362 --> 19:09.148
- Hi.
- Hey, Riz.

19:09.235 --> 19:10.888
They canceled our training.

19:10.975 --> 19:15.937
I was sitting in my bunk, so--

19:16.024 --> 19:18.113
[Louis] So you decided
to come by here?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.335
Yeah.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.598
[food sizzling]

19:25.990 --> 19:27.340
[Louis] Look who I found.

19:27.427 --> 19:29.516
Hey, join us for dinner.

19:29.603 --> 19:30.734
There goes date night.

19:30.821 --> 19:32.301
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:32.388 --> 19:34.260
No, no, no, no,
don't listen to him.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.262
His idea of date night ends
with him falling asleep

19:36.349 --> 19:38.481
listening to the sat-link,
and me doing the dishes.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.658
[Louis] Babe, you don't do
the dishes, the machine does.

19:41.745 --> 19:44.574
Someone has to press
the button, come here.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.882
You know, I hope you're hungry.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.406
I can give you some
treatment after we eat, yeah?

19:50.493 --> 19:51.712
Oh, I didn't really
come here for that.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.018
Everything okay?

19:54.105 --> 19:58.109
Um, I guess I just
started walking,

19:58.197 --> 20:03.332
but it turns out I don't
really have anywhere to go.

20:03.419 --> 20:06.074
Oh, for God's sake,
you're making me sad.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.381
Now we have to drink, sit.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.779
It looks beautiful.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.825
Thank you.

20:17.912 --> 20:20.219
Louis' health?

20:20.306 --> 20:21.611
What are we drinking?

20:21.698 --> 20:23.918
Your favorite.

20:37.888 --> 20:39.977
Talk to me.

20:40.064 --> 20:44.243
The other day, you said

20:44.330 --> 20:49.944
there were other ways to live,
other things to be.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.511
That's right.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.515
Like what?

20:55.602 --> 20:56.777
[soft chuckle]

20:59.997 --> 21:02.870
We didn't know the
mission wasn't authorized.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.307
Me, Riz, Vannak.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.483
We were in the dark.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.398
And for the record,

21:09.485 --> 21:10.878
Chief was just doing what
he thought was right.

21:10.965 --> 21:13.272
Well, that's what concerns me.

21:13.359 --> 21:14.534
Look, I appreciate
you coming down here

21:14.621 --> 21:15.970
to advocate for your CO.

21:16.057 --> 21:18.277
If the Chief went
outside the chain,

21:18.364 --> 21:21.584
there needs to be
discipline, I get that.

21:21.671 --> 21:23.847
But we're not built
to sit around and wait.

21:23.934 --> 21:26.241
It's not good for us.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.157
We need to be in the fight.

21:29.244 --> 21:30.941
I'm not gonna
change my decision.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.421
I'm not asking you to.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.511
We are at war, sir.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.426
We're still the best
weapons you have.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.341
Are you suggesting
I deploy Silver Team

21:39.428 --> 21:41.082
without its leader?

21:41.169 --> 21:42.692
No, sir.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.434
Just me.

21:45.521 --> 21:48.872
Temporarily,
'til John's cleared.

21:48.959 --> 21:50.004
And if he's not?

21:51.353 --> 21:52.615
He's the Chief.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.882
Twenty minutes ago,

21:58.969 --> 22:01.450
John incapacitated the soldiers
assigned to monitor him,

22:01.537 --> 22:03.278
and escaped this facility.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.889
What?

22:05.976 --> 22:07.543
[Ackerson] Did he share
his plans with you?

22:07.630 --> 22:09.763
Plans, what?

22:09.850 --> 22:11.330
- What plans?
- Where is he?

22:11.417 --> 22:12.679
Oh, I don't know.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.941
Last time we spoke,

22:14.028 --> 22:15.551
I asked you if you had concerns

22:15.638 --> 22:16.900
about John's mental
stability, and you said---

22:16.987 --> 22:18.815
- That was before.
- Before what?

22:20.251 --> 22:22.689
How long has this been going on?

22:22.776 --> 22:24.604
- I don't know.
- Since Cortana was removed,

22:24.691 --> 22:27.607
or since John interacted
with the Covenant agent?

22:28.869 --> 22:30.044
I reviewed the file.

22:30.131 --> 22:31.306
What are you implying?

22:32.612 --> 22:35.615
You and I both know
he's not himself.

22:38.269 --> 22:41.925
Look, Kai, I, I want to
share something with you,

22:42.012 --> 22:44.624
and this isn't me speaking
as your superior, this is...

22:48.932 --> 22:50.543
sometimes people
don't get better.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.242
He just needs time.

22:56.287 --> 22:58.420
Sometimes, we do more
damage by holding on.

23:01.205 --> 23:03.338
I can't stay and watch him.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.602
[Ackerson] I know.

23:08.517 --> 23:09.475
Tell me what to do.

23:16.482 --> 23:19.310
[Kwan] Sometimes it takes weeks
to get here, sometimes months.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.269
Some never get here at all.

23:21.356 --> 23:24.011
We left Madrigal
with four ships.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.447
We arrived with one.

23:27.928 --> 23:29.930
You see that?

23:30.017 --> 23:32.846
That's where they process
you before you're indentured.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.587
It's not free.

23:36.719 --> 23:38.286
Nothing is free.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.295
I'm sorry.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.385
For what
happened to you.

23:51.299 --> 23:52.561
Don't be.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.738
Most people have it worse,

23:55.825 --> 23:58.611
and sometimes I
think I deserve it.

23:59.699 --> 24:01.135
I'm being punished.

24:01.222 --> 24:04.617
- Don't talk like that.
- It's true.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.794
I'm not supposed to be
here, this isn't my life.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.536
I failed my responsibility
to my people and my planet.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.625
You can't blame
yourself for that.

24:12.712 --> 24:13.756
I'm Kwan Ha.

24:15.584 --> 24:19.283
My family protected Madrigal

24:19.370 --> 24:21.677
for more generations
than anyone can count.

24:24.375 --> 24:26.290
And when it was my turn...

24:26.377 --> 24:28.292
[alarm blaring]

24:28.379 --> 24:30.120
[Laera] Kwan?

24:30.207 --> 24:33.733
[voices shouting]

24:33.820 --> 24:35.474
It's time to go.
We can blend in.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.128
We have to move now.

24:43.307 --> 24:47.181
- [radios crackling]
- [voices shouting]

24:48.443 --> 24:51.664
[suspenseful music]

24:58.061 --> 24:59.585
Take it off, they'll notice you.

25:02.326 --> 25:05.242
[engine rumbling]

25:05.329 --> 25:07.680
- Are we hiding?
- No.

25:07.767 --> 25:11.335
- Where are we going?
- To get your dad back.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.033
Are we scared?

25:15.862 --> 25:17.994
No. Stay close.

25:20.040 --> 25:23.043
[suspenseful music]

25:34.576 --> 25:36.056
[Kwan] Keep your head down.

25:36.143 --> 25:37.623
Don't look.

25:37.710 --> 25:38.928
[suspenseful music continues]

25:39.015 --> 25:40.321
[man]
Rising forward.

25:40.408 --> 25:42.323
[man 2]
Keep moving!

26:03.257 --> 26:07.435
[suspenseful music continues]

26:07.522 --> 26:10.481
- Are we scared now?
- Strap in.

26:10.569 --> 26:15.225
[suspenseful music continues]

26:15.312 --> 26:20.491
- [ship engine blasting]
- [suspenseful music continues]

26:23.538 --> 26:26.410
[dismayed shouting]

26:26.497 --> 26:29.109
Everything's gonna be okay, Kes.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.591
We're gonna get your dad now.

26:34.201 --> 26:38.335
- Told you.
- [suspenseful music continues]

26:38.422 --> 26:42.557
- [Laera] Oh, no, no.
- [suspenseful music continues]

26:42.644 --> 26:44.646
[Kwan] No, we're
not gonna make it!

26:44.733 --> 26:46.692
[Laera] Hold on!

26:46.779 --> 26:51.740
- [ship engine blasting]
- [suspenseful music continues]

26:53.307 --> 26:56.266
- Mom!
- [suspenseful music continues]

26:56.353 --> 26:58.225
Mom!

26:58.312 --> 27:02.011
- [Laera] Damn it!
- [suspenseful music continues]

27:02.098 --> 27:07.103
- [ship engine powers down]
- [suspenseful music continues]

27:13.327 --> 27:15.111
What are you doing?

27:15.198 --> 27:16.678
Wait for my move,
then get Kessler out of here.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.638
- Use the hatch.
- What about you?

27:19.725 --> 27:21.248
It's worth enough
to get both of you

27:21.335 --> 27:23.511
- on that transport.
- No.

27:23.598 --> 27:25.121
Promise me you'll
get him on that ship.

27:25.208 --> 27:27.820
Promise me you'll protect him.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.561
- [banging on door]
- [Antares] Laera!

27:30.649 --> 27:32.476
- No, they'll kill you.
- Mom?

27:32.563 --> 27:34.957
[gentle music]

27:35.044 --> 27:36.742
- [Antares] Open up, Laera!
- [gentle music continues]

27:36.829 --> 27:40.920
- I'll see you soon.
- [gentle music continues]

27:41.007 --> 27:42.573
[banging on door]

27:42.661 --> 27:45.098
[Antares] Don't make
me torch this door.

27:46.186 --> 27:47.753
There she is.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.409
Smart girl, this
could have got messy.

27:52.496 --> 27:57.545
- Laera, I'm sorry, I never--
- Give it up, it's not personal.

27:57.632 --> 27:59.112
It is!

27:59.199 --> 28:03.464
- [blows landing]
- [fighters grunting]

28:07.076 --> 28:09.165
[Briggs] We found
Cobalt Team 80 meters

28:09.252 --> 28:10.645
from the relay.

28:10.732 --> 28:11.907
They were in the trees.

28:13.822 --> 28:16.695
We observed plasma
scarring in the area.

28:16.782 --> 28:19.523
I don't think they
saw it coming.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.004
[Keyes] Thank you, Captain.

28:22.091 --> 28:24.877
[Briggs] How would you
like to handle this?

28:24.964 --> 28:27.140
The bodies, sir?

28:27.227 --> 28:28.968
[Keyes] There are no bodies.

28:29.055 --> 28:32.623
- I would list it as MIA.
- Sir.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.452
- Let's go.
- [door closes]

28:43.504 --> 28:45.636
You all right, Admiral?

28:48.030 --> 28:48.857
No.

28:51.338 --> 28:53.079
I understand.

28:54.515 --> 28:55.995
It's a tragedy.

28:56.082 --> 28:59.172
- Did you know...
- Pardon me?

28:59.259 --> 29:03.480
Did you know that Master Chief's
suspicions were valid

29:03.567 --> 29:06.396
when you sent our soldiers
out into a hostile--

29:06.483 --> 29:08.442
I resent the implication.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.400
I want to know what you knew,

29:10.487 --> 29:12.054
and I want to know
when you knew it.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.840
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

29:17.364 --> 29:19.148
The Covenant is on this planet!

29:19.235 --> 29:21.063
It was a matter of time.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.630
This day was inevitable.

29:22.717 --> 29:24.066
It's mathematics, Admiral.

29:24.153 --> 29:26.590
In every analysis,
every simulation--

29:26.677 --> 29:28.549
This is not
a goddamn simulation!

29:28.636 --> 29:31.378
Right, it's not.

29:31.465 --> 29:34.598
But it's my job to
decide what to do next.

29:34.685 --> 29:36.252
We have to alert command.

29:36.339 --> 29:39.690
I assure you, your superiors
are already fully aware.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.041
[scoffs]

29:44.217 --> 29:46.697
We need to initiate
the Winter Contingency.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.439
Begin immediate
civilian evacuation!

29:49.526 --> 29:53.792
It's over, Admiral.
We don't get to win this one.

29:53.879 --> 29:56.838
If you send out
an evacuation alert,

29:56.925 --> 29:59.536
we'll have chaos, panic.

29:59.623 --> 30:02.409
The Covenant element hit
Cobalt Team days ago.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.672
We can only assume the Covenant
fleet isn't far behind.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.675
There is a plan in place,

30:07.762 --> 30:10.330
but it's going to require
some hard choices.

30:13.202 --> 30:14.813
I need to know that
you're with me.

30:16.118 --> 30:19.948
[tense music]

30:20.035 --> 30:23.256
- We're not gonna fight.
- I didn't say that.

30:23.343 --> 30:26.085
We're going to fight, we're
just not going to win.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.915
[tense music continues]

30:30.002 --> 30:31.699
- This is Reach.
- I know.

30:31.786 --> 30:33.657
Home to millions of people--

30:33.744 --> 30:35.007
And we will save what we can.

30:35.094 --> 30:39.315
- This is my home!
- It is my home too!

30:39.402 --> 30:42.928
Don't think for a second this
doesn't cost me everything.

30:44.538 --> 30:46.453
[tense music continues]

30:46.540 --> 30:51.675
- but this is reality, Admiral.
- [tense music continues]

30:51.762 --> 30:54.504
We can either face it or we die.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.680
[tense music continues]

30:56.767 --> 30:58.900
Essential assets are
being transported

30:58.987 --> 31:00.684
off the planet as we speak.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.861
Get your things together.

31:02.948 --> 31:05.864
- Tell no one.
- [tense music continues]

31:05.951 --> 31:07.909
I won't run.

31:07.996 --> 31:11.608
You'll fight another
day when we can win.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.784
[tense music continues]

31:13.872 --> 31:19.051
Admiral Keyes,
can I count on you?

31:19.138 --> 31:21.401
[tense music continues]

31:21.488 --> 31:25.927
- Go fuck yourself.
- [tense music continues]

31:34.718 --> 31:36.807
[Laera] Where's my husband?

31:36.895 --> 31:38.897
- Is he alive?
- Antares?

31:38.984 --> 31:42.596
- It's not too late, Antares.
- Yeah, it is.

31:42.683 --> 31:46.078
[ship engines power up]

31:49.081 --> 31:50.996
Go on, Kwan.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.172
[tense music]

31:53.259 --> 31:54.651
[voice clears throat]

31:59.700 --> 32:01.397
[guard]
Halt.

32:01.484 --> 32:02.355
[guard]
Wait.

32:02.442 --> 32:04.096
Where's my mom?

32:04.183 --> 32:08.970
- [tense music continues]
- [ship engine powers up]

32:09.057 --> 32:13.235
- Will I see her soon?
- [tense music continues]

32:13.322 --> 32:17.761
- Tell the truth.
- [tense music continues]

32:17.848 --> 32:20.939
- Yes.
- [tense music continues]

32:27.423 --> 32:33.212
- Best in the city. You want?
- No.

32:33.299 --> 32:36.345
- Try it.
- No, thank you.

32:36.432 --> 32:39.348
[diners chatter]

32:45.789 --> 32:47.922
You've always had this problem.

32:48.009 --> 32:50.533
You are not in control.

32:50.620 --> 32:52.231
You mean not controllable.

32:52.318 --> 32:54.450
We had an agreement.

32:54.537 --> 32:56.931
You were to bring me
information, not attention.

32:57.018 --> 32:58.933
I have information.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.630
But I wanna know what you're
gonna do with it first.

33:02.197 --> 33:05.331
We have a common
goal to win the war.

33:07.028 --> 33:09.335
Don't mistake me for a friend.

33:09.422 --> 33:14.427
- Okay.
- [diners chatter]

33:18.909 --> 33:21.042
I believe the Covenant is here.

33:21.129 --> 33:24.350
- In the ramen?
- On Reach.

33:30.704 --> 33:31.835
You're serious.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.750
A team of Spartans went missing.

33:33.837 --> 33:36.144
FLEETCOM is pretending they
don't know what happened.

33:36.231 --> 33:37.319
And do you think it's
the Covenant that--

33:37.406 --> 33:39.191
I know it's the Covenant.

33:42.281 --> 33:44.196
I suggest you consider
what you're saying.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.067
That's all I've been doing.

33:46.154 --> 33:47.938
I've been thinking it.
I've been saying it.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.071
And nobody seems
to be listening.

33:50.158 --> 33:53.814
- ONI knows!
- Keep your voice down.

33:53.901 --> 33:57.122
[low] ONI knows.
They're covering it up.

33:57.209 --> 33:59.820
Why would they do that?

33:59.907 --> 34:02.214
The ONI protects itself.

34:02.301 --> 34:03.780
Make them your enemy,

34:03.867 --> 34:06.740
and it won't matter that
you're Master Chief,

34:06.827 --> 34:09.090
you will cease to be useful.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.353
And when you cease
to be useful, that--

34:11.440 --> 34:15.227
- No, you're not listening,
- Why do you fight, John?

34:16.924 --> 34:20.971
- What?
- You fight, why?

34:21.059 --> 34:25.628
To win, to defend our home.

34:25.715 --> 34:27.456
To preserve humanity.

34:27.543 --> 34:32.548
No, you fight
because I tell you to.

34:32.635 --> 34:36.509
You are a soldier, be a soldier.

34:38.293 --> 34:40.426
This is what you will do.

34:40.513 --> 34:42.689
Go back there.

34:42.776 --> 34:44.647
Go back to FLEETCOM.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.432
Kiss whatever ass
you have to kiss.

34:46.519 --> 34:48.695
You go do your time in the brig.

34:48.782 --> 34:49.913
Smile.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.264
You'll never speak of it again.

34:52.351 --> 34:54.831
They will probably
give you another medal.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.444
[chair scrapes]

35:00.272 --> 35:04.928
[tense music]

35:05.015 --> 35:08.280
I need to know we
understand each other.

35:08.367 --> 35:12.719
When exactly did you
leave ONI, Admiral?

35:12.806 --> 35:16.026
If you walk out of here,
I won't be able to help you.

35:16.114 --> 35:19.900
- You never left.
- Stand down, John.

35:21.467 --> 35:22.642
I don't think so.

35:23.817 --> 35:26.080
[tense music continues]

35:41.182 --> 35:44.664
[Ackerson] I never understood
how fragile they really are.

35:46.970 --> 35:49.059
Fragile?

35:49.147 --> 35:51.236
Yes, because you
made them that way.

35:51.323 --> 35:52.846
No.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.195
You took them when
they were children.

35:54.282 --> 35:56.371
You conditioned them.

35:56.458 --> 35:58.025
And then when they were old
enough to think for themselves,

35:58.112 --> 36:00.549
you made sure they never would.

36:00.636 --> 36:03.987
You put in those pellets.

36:04.074 --> 36:06.033
So they never had to feel desire

36:06.120 --> 36:11.560
or ambition or preference.

36:11.647 --> 36:14.563
So they would never choose
anyone other than you.

36:16.870 --> 36:18.698
And that's it, isn't it?

36:18.785 --> 36:21.918
- Why are you here?
- I just came to say goodbye.

36:22.702 --> 36:24.878
I'm leaving.

36:24.965 --> 36:29.535
And I, I suppose
I wanted you to know

36:29.622 --> 36:31.885
that your efforts weren't
in vain, Catherine,

36:31.972 --> 36:33.582
you won't be here to see it.

36:33.669 --> 36:39.109
But these things that you
made, broken as they may be,

36:39.197 --> 36:40.763
they're going to
become the foundation

36:40.850 --> 36:43.418
for something extraordinary.

36:45.986 --> 36:49.555
And I hope that gives you
some comfort in the end.

36:49.642 --> 36:53.298
[gentle music]

36:53.385 --> 36:55.952
Don't you want to
know how she died?

36:56.039 --> 37:00.174
[gentle music continues]

37:01.349 --> 37:02.785
What?

37:04.526 --> 37:07.877
Julia. Did you think I didn't
know who she was?

37:08.965 --> 37:11.229
I remember all of them.

37:12.578 --> 37:14.319
Especially your sister.

37:15.842 --> 37:20.368
She was... she was so curious.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.762
She used to ask
so many questions.

37:25.286 --> 37:27.506
But you never know
who's going to make it through

37:27.593 --> 37:31.727
the augmentation and who isn't.

37:31.814 --> 37:34.643
- And she didn't.
- [gentle music continues]

37:34.730 --> 37:36.906
- No.
- [gentle music continues]

37:36.993 --> 37:39.474
She was dying.

37:42.651 --> 37:46.264
She didn't know why.
She couldn't understand.

37:48.701 --> 37:52.574
I told her more or less
what you just told me.

37:52.661 --> 37:57.884
That even though
she wouldn't see it,

37:57.971 --> 38:03.672
she would be this small part
of the next step forward.

38:05.326 --> 38:07.023
I don't know if she understood.

38:08.024 --> 38:09.461
She was so scared.

38:12.159 --> 38:17.295
But I do know that she
loved you very much.

38:19.079 --> 38:22.952
And I hope that gives
you some comfort.

38:23.039 --> 38:26.391
[gentle music continues]

38:30.133 --> 38:31.961
[soft chuckle]
Yeah.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.494
[dramatic exhalation]

38:48.238 --> 38:50.110
I thought you were leaving.

38:50.197 --> 38:52.591
I didn't want you to be alone.

38:52.678 --> 38:56.986
- I'm not a monster.
- [gentle music continues]

38:59.511 --> 39:01.687
[tense music]

39:09.738 --> 39:12.915
[Ackerson] I'll let
you two get reacquainted.

39:13.002 --> 39:15.178
[tense music continues]

39:15.265 --> 39:17.920
[steady, metallic pounding]

39:18.007 --> 39:19.661
You are making it very
difficult for me to help you.

39:19.748 --> 39:22.882
- Boss, we're exiting slip space.
- I heard you.

39:22.969 --> 39:24.927
I let them have their way...

39:25.014 --> 39:27.190
[dramatic chuckle]
...you'd already be dead.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.627
We were good to you, Antares.

39:28.714 --> 39:31.020
Oh. Well.

39:31.586 --> 39:34.763
Thank you for
allowing me to barely exist

39:34.850 --> 39:36.678
and to scrape out a meager
living split four ways

39:36.765 --> 39:39.855
with these bozos while you
and your husband spent

39:39.942 --> 39:41.770
- all that Madrigal money on--
- What are you talking about?

39:41.857 --> 39:43.206
Don't play stupid!

39:43.293 --> 39:44.730
I know you're not.

39:44.817 --> 39:46.209
I can usually reason
with my husband,

39:46.296 --> 39:48.124
but when he finds
out about this--

39:48.211 --> 39:51.563
I'm not really worried.
Last I see Soren,

39:51.650 --> 39:54.043
his was on a prison
ship headed for Reach.

39:54.130 --> 39:56.089
So settle in.

39:56.176 --> 39:59.397
It could be a while.

39:59.484 --> 40:04.358
- You're a son of a bitch.
- No, I'm an opportunist.

40:05.620 --> 40:09.929
[distant metallic clanking]

40:10.016 --> 40:13.106
Now, where is it?

40:13.193 --> 40:17.632
[distant clanking continues]

40:17.719 --> 40:19.025
Would somebody please
deal with that?

40:19.112 --> 40:21.114
I can't hear myself think.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.551
[distant clanking continues]

40:23.638 --> 40:24.813
Thank you.

40:24.900 --> 40:27.555
[distant clanking continues]

40:27.642 --> 40:29.905
I don't know what
Ruby Ann promised you,

40:29.992 --> 40:32.081
but you are getting played,
Antares, and it's not too late.

40:32.168 --> 40:37.391
Stop, please.

40:37.478 --> 40:40.176
Soren tells you everything.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.961
You know where he's stashed it.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.267
- Stashed what?
- The treasure.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.791
[Laera laughing]

40:45.878 --> 40:47.619
You think this is funny?

40:50.273 --> 40:52.711
Because I guarantee you...

40:52.798 --> 40:56.541
[tense music]

40:56.628 --> 40:57.629
...it's not.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.417
What you call a treasure
was a box full

41:03.504 --> 41:05.637
of deuterium tokens that wasn't
worth much to begin with.

41:05.724 --> 41:10.990
- Heard enough.
- [tense music continues]

41:11.077 --> 41:12.295
Ruby Ann doesn't want the money.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.340
She wants The Rubble.

41:13.427 --> 41:14.776
- [gun cocks]
- [Laera gasps]

41:14.863 --> 41:18.519
- Calm down.
- [tense music continues]

41:18.606 --> 41:20.739
Why are you making me do this?

41:20.826 --> 41:24.394
You think I want to
leave Kessler an orphan?

41:24.482 --> 41:26.309
I love that kid.

41:26.396 --> 41:28.268
She's laughing at you.

41:28.355 --> 41:30.444
[distant clanking continues]

41:30.531 --> 41:33.491
- You hear that sound?
- Yeah.

41:33.578 --> 41:37.233
Yeah, you think you should
do something about it?

41:37.320 --> 41:38.539
I'm watching.

41:38.626 --> 41:40.410
[distant clanking continues]

41:40.498 --> 41:43.239
Go see what's making that sound.

41:43.326 --> 41:48.027
[distant clanking continues]

41:56.078 --> 41:58.167
- Where's the stash?
- She's stalling.

41:58.254 --> 42:00.430
Would you shut up?

42:00.518 --> 42:02.084
I don't remember asking
anyone's opinion.

42:03.433 --> 42:04.870
I'm the captain.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.568
This is my ship,

42:07.655 --> 42:11.224
and this is your
last chance, Laera.

42:11.311 --> 42:13.443
[distant
clanking continues]

42:13.531 --> 42:17.143
- Where is it?
- [tense music continues]

42:17.230 --> 42:19.580
I can't tell you
because it doesn't exist.

42:19.667 --> 42:22.365
And if it did exist,
I wouldn't tell you.

42:22.452 --> 42:26.108
[tense music continues]

42:26.195 --> 42:30.286
You've just taken
it outta my hands.

42:30.373 --> 42:34.290
Just remember, I didn't
want what happens next.

42:34.377 --> 42:37.816
[tense music continues]

42:43.125 --> 42:47.956

- [hydraulics hissing]

42:58.967 --> 43:03.624
[tense music]

43:03.711 --> 43:08.107
You have one minute
to rethink your position.

43:08.194 --> 43:13.634
- [countdown beeping]
- [air hissing]

43:13.721 --> 43:15.854
It doesn't have to be this way.

43:15.941 --> 43:18.639
[Laera struggles to breathe]

43:18.726 --> 43:20.989
Think of Kessler!

43:21.076 --> 43:24.384
With Soren on Reach,
who's gonna look after him?

43:24.471 --> 43:26.299
- [Laera struggles to breathe]
- [tense music building]

43:26.386 --> 43:27.953
- Just tell me what I wanna kn--
- [blood splattering]

43:32.871 --> 43:36.004
[alarm blaring]

43:36.091 --> 43:38.833

44:00.246 --> 44:04.380
- [knife clinking on metal]
- [gentle music continues]

44:09.472 --> 44:11.736
Where's Kessler?

44:13.389 --> 44:17.393
- Kwan?
- [gentle music continues]

44:17.480 --> 44:20.527
Kwan, I asked you a question--

44:20.614 --> 44:23.617
- [Carina grunting]
- [Kwan yelling]

44:23.704 --> 44:28.535
- [knife squelching]
- [tense music continues]

44:28.622 --> 44:33.148
- [Kwan grunting]
- [body thudding]

44:33.235 --> 44:35.107
[gentle music]

44:35.194 --> 44:38.371
- I put him on the transport.
- I told you to stay with him.

44:38.458 --> 44:41.548
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

44:41.635 --> 44:42.897
'Cause then you'd be dead.

44:44.551 --> 44:47.510
[gentle music continues]

44:47.597 --> 44:51.863
[banging on door]

44:51.950 --> 44:54.648
I need to speak
with Corporal Perez.

44:54.735 --> 44:57.695
- She's not here.
- Where is she?

45:00.567 --> 45:03.222
She's a good girl.

45:04.963 --> 45:06.051
Yes, ma'am.

45:07.443 --> 45:11.143
But I think
the devil follows you.

45:11.230 --> 45:13.275
[gentle music]

45:22.632 --> 45:24.286
What time is it?

45:25.418 --> 45:27.550
- Late.
- Uh-huh.

45:27.637 --> 45:32.338
[gentle music continues]

45:32.425 --> 45:33.861
What am I doing here?

45:37.560 --> 45:39.954
Do you remember
what we talked about?

45:41.434 --> 45:43.305
You asked me to...

45:45.830 --> 45:49.268
To don't let them
take me alive?

45:49.355 --> 45:52.271
Yeah, that's right.

45:54.490 --> 45:55.970
Today's the day?

45:59.365 --> 46:00.888
Today's the day.

46:03.586 --> 46:05.240
Thank God.

46:24.912 --> 46:26.218
Ohh.

46:33.921 --> 46:37.577
[gentle music continues]

46:40.145 --> 46:42.060
There's someone here
to see you, Dad.

46:50.155 --> 46:53.898
[gasping]

46:53.985 --> 46:56.248
[gentle music continues]

46:56.335 --> 46:59.555
Oh, Julia.

47:03.298 --> 47:05.344
Julia.

47:13.526 --> 47:14.962
[door opens loudly]

47:17.051 --> 47:21.969
- [heavy footfalls]
- [Perez praying quietly]

47:31.152 --> 47:32.414

47:44.818 --> 47:48.822
- [door closes]
- [Perez continues praying]

48:09.016 --> 48:12.280
Never been in a church before,
have you?

48:12.367 --> 48:13.629
Mnh-mnh.

48:17.024 --> 48:19.157
People come here for comfort.

48:20.549 --> 48:22.116
For protection.

48:24.989 --> 48:26.033
For answers.

48:28.514 --> 48:29.907
Do they find them?

48:31.386 --> 48:32.431
Sometimes.

48:34.302 --> 48:35.913
Do you?

48:42.528 --> 48:44.965
On Sanctuary,

48:45.052 --> 48:48.403
before the Covenant came, I...

48:48.490 --> 48:52.451
I saw something... in the fog.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.154
You mean the woman?

49:00.241 --> 49:02.330
[labored breathing]

49:02.417 --> 49:06.117
She's real, isn't she?

49:06.204 --> 49:08.032
Yes.

49:11.644 --> 49:13.124
I don't sleep.

49:15.300 --> 49:18.433
I can't get that
sound outta my head.

49:30.358 --> 49:32.708
This is a recording
from Sanctuary.

49:33.927 --> 49:36.451
It's not just interference.

49:36.538 --> 49:37.757
Not just a sound.

49:39.541 --> 49:41.195
There's something underneath.

49:42.327 --> 49:45.286
[recording playing Sangheili]

49:45.373 --> 49:47.593
What is it?

49:47.680 --> 49:52.250
[recording playing
Sangheili continues]

49:52.337 --> 49:53.860
A prayer.

come without mercy.</i>

Journey of my people.

Death.</i>
