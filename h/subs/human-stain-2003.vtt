01:28.900 --> 01:30.230
This is the story...

01:30.430 --> 01:34.600
and the tricky life and bitter downfall of Coleman Silk.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.760
You mean to tell me you're
President of the United States

03:52.840 --> 03:55.590
and you're banging some
22 year-old intern in the White House

03:55.680 --> 03:56.970
and you ask her to keep her mouth shut,

03:57.050 --> 04:00.510
and you really think she's gonna do it?
I mean, come on, give me a break!

04:00.640 --> 04:03.640
Clinton. He should count himself lucky
she didn't go straight to Oprah.

04:03.850 --> 04:07.520
Come on, she was overwhelmed by
Starr's team in that hotel room.

04:07.690 --> 04:09.980
No, poor thing.
Eleven guys hitting on her?

04:10.110 --> 04:11.440
- That's a gang-bang.
- Oh, right.

04:11.530 --> 04:13.030
That's why she's talking to Linda Tripp.

04:13.070 --> 04:13.900
She's talking to everybody.

04:13.990 --> 04:16.110
She's part of that whole dopey culture.
Yak yak yak.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.620
Oh, look, if Clinton couldn't
figure Monica Lewinsky,

04:18.740 --> 04:19.779
then he shouldn't
have been president.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.329
That's grounds for
impeachment right there.

04:21.410 --> 04:22.500
- That's true.
- You're right.

04:22.580 --> 04:23.830
I'm telling you,
if he'd just fucked her.

04:23.910 --> 04:25.210
That's the way you
create loyalty.

04:25.290 --> 04:26.420
- Yeah.
- That's the way.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.250
But you know what Kennedy would
have done to her? Or Nixon?

04:29.380 --> 04:33.300
They would have told her,
Not only are you not gonna work,

04:33.380 --> 04:36.180
you're not gonna work ever again.
And your father's gonna be out of work.

04:36.260 --> 04:38.340
And your mother. And your brother

04:38.470 --> 04:41.720
Everybody in your family is
not gonna make one more thin dime

04:41.810 --> 04:43.520
unless you keep your mouth shut.

04:43.560 --> 04:46.520
Well, but Clinton plays it like a lawyer.
That's why he didn't want to come.

04:46.560 --> 04:48.400
Hey, when he came,
he was finished.

04:48.480 --> 04:51.230
Evidence.
Smoking come.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.690
Nineteen ninety-eight was
the summer of sanctimony.

04:55.780 --> 05:00.740
After the fall of Communism and
before the horrors of terrorism,

05:00.870 --> 05:06.210
there was a brief interlude when
the nation was preoccupied by cocksucking.

05:07.990 --> 05:09.380
This is Coleman Silk

05:09.490 --> 05:12.750
once the powerful Dean
of Faculty and professor of Classics

05:12.820 --> 05:15.490
at Athena College in western Massachusetts.

05:15.990 --> 05:20.120
One of the first Jews to teach in a Classics department anywhere in America.

05:20.900 --> 05:25.300
When Coleman had been appointed Dean, he had ruthlessly

05:25.400 --> 05:29.700
hacked away the debt woods, streamlined the curriculum and dragged Athena

05:29.810 --> 05:34.440
kicking and screaming,
from mediocrity to excellence.

05:35.450 --> 05:39.610
Of course, in the process, he made a good many enemies.

05:40.020 --> 05:43.820
Sing, O Gods,
of the wrath of Achilles

05:43.920 --> 05:48.360
And finally, "the persecuting spirit"
caught up with Coleman.

05:48.430 --> 05:52.330
All of European literature springs from a fight,

05:52.560 --> 05:54.790
a barroom brawl, really.

05:55.830 --> 05:59.230
And what was Achilles so angry about?

06:00.770 --> 06:04.370
Well, he and King Agamemnon
were quarrelling over a woman,

06:05.780 --> 06:08.070
a young girl and her body

06:08.580 --> 06:12.040
and the delights of sexual rapacity.

06:12.350 --> 06:15.340
Achilles, the most hypersensitive

06:15.450 --> 06:18.510
fighting machine in the history of warfare.

06:19.360 --> 06:23.880
Achilles, who, because of his rage
at having to give up the girl,

06:24.060 --> 06:29.020
isolates himself defiantly
outside the very society

06:29.470 --> 06:32.700
whose protector he is and
whose need of him is enormous.

06:32.710 --> 06:40.050
Achilles, has to give up the girl.
He has to give her back.

06:40.510 --> 06:44.350
And that is how the great imaginative
literature of Europe begins,

06:44.430 --> 06:47.520
and that is why
three thousand years later,

06:47.680 --> 06:52.520
we are going to
begin there today.

06:54.190 --> 06:59.360
Miss Cummings, Tracy Cummings,
can you tell us

06:59.990 --> 07:04.870
Still not here. Okay.
Mr. Thomas, William Thomas.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.410
Is he here?

07:08.080 --> 07:10.620
We're five weeks into the semester

07:10.700 --> 07:13.040
and I haven't even laid eyes on these folks.

07:13.080 --> 07:16.920
Can anyone tell me, do these people exist?

07:17.040 --> 07:18.840
Or are they spooks?

07:18.960 --> 07:20.510
Were you aware, Professor Silk,

07:20.550 --> 07:24.720
that Tracy Cummings and William Thomas
are African-Americans?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.100
How could I be?
I've never seen them.

07:27.180 --> 07:32.350
But you are aware of
the connotation of the word "spook."

07:32.480 --> 07:35.810
Ghost Professor Roux. Ghost.

07:35.900 --> 07:39.820
I was referring to
their ectoplasmic character.

07:40.730 --> 07:47.370
Here is the, uh, first definition
of the word. I quote

07:47.490 --> 07:53.870
Spook, Informal
Ghost, Spectre

07:54.080 --> 07:58.340
But, Dean Silk, let me remind you
of the second definition

07:58.460 --> 07:59.630
Negro.

07:59.750 --> 08:04.840
I'd never laid eyes on them.
How could I know they were black? Hmm?

08:05.090 --> 08:06.800
All I did know was
that they were invisible.

08:06.930 --> 08:09.260
Nevertheless,
they have lodged a complaint.

08:09.350 --> 08:11.890
Miss Cummings was devastated.
Now the issue here

08:11.930 --> 08:14.390
These students have
never attended a single class.

08:14.440 --> 08:18.480
Do they exist or are they spooks?
Consider the context.

08:18.560 --> 08:22.110
- But, Dean Silk
- I've not finished!

08:23.400 --> 08:26.110
The only issue is the nonattendance
of these students,

08:26.200 --> 08:30.740
their inexcusable neglect of work
and their sheer chutzpah.

08:32.159 --> 08:35.620
Oh, Miss Cummings is devastated.
Give me a break, will you?

08:35.659 --> 08:38.250
To charge me with racism
is not only false,

08:38.289 --> 08:42.960
it is spectacularly false!
And you know it!

08:43.919 --> 08:46.930
Thanks a lot, Herb.

08:49.510 --> 08:51.350
- Well, I've quit.
- What?

08:51.430 --> 08:53.600
I've resigned from
that half-assed college.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.850
Where's that last year's phone book?

08:56.230 --> 08:58.940
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. What happened?

08:59.020 --> 09:02.360
- I've been accused of a racist epithet.
- What racist epithet?

09:02.440 --> 09:05.490
I used the word "spooks," which
fifty years ago was just a slang

09:05.610 --> 09:06.950
I know what it was slang for.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.990
Where's that phone book?
We'll sue these wimpy bastards.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.120
- I want that lawyer, Alfred or whatever
- Wait, did you remind them

09:11.200 --> 09:12.950
- that when you were dean you...
- Yeah, I reminded them.

09:12.990 --> 09:17.040
No, you hired Herb Keble,
the first black...

09:17.120 --> 09:18.500
- Please, "African-American," please.
- Okay

09:18.540 --> 09:21.130
- African-American, ever on the faculty.
- Where's that book?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.170
Isn't Herb on the same committee?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.300
- But wait, wait, just tell me
- Yes, he is.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.300
And they're our friends,
for God's sake!

09:26.470 --> 09:29.130
- Did Herb even open his mouth?
- Yes, yes.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.800
I'm sorry, Coleman, I can't be
with you on this. Bullshit.

09:31.850 --> 09:32.970
Fine, fine. They want to fight?

09:33.060 --> 09:34.470
I'll give them a fight
that they'll never forget!

09:34.520 --> 09:39.560
This is absolute lunacy!
After 35 years of your devotion

09:39.650 --> 09:41.440
Now you know what we're going to do?
We're going to organize.

09:41.520 --> 09:44.320
We're going to get them to sign
a petition. That's what we'll do.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.860
No. You know what we're going to do?
We're going to do a two-pronged attack.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.530
We're going to attack
We're going to get lawyers,

09:49.610 --> 09:53.080
because I know some...
Okay. I know. Which is why

09:53.160 --> 09:56.250
- Coly?
- What?

09:56.410 --> 10:00.580
- Something's wrong.
- I know there is. What do you mean?

10:00.750 --> 10:02.590
- Coly
- What's the matter?

10:02.670 --> 10:06.340
- Coly
- Hey, come on, sit down.

10:07.010 --> 10:10.090
What's the matter?
Come on.

10:10.300 --> 10:13.050
- Come on.
- I'm sorry.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.100
It's all right.

10:17.390 --> 10:20.190
I'm sorry

10:43.380 --> 10:48.590
Iris Silk died several hours later
in her husband's arms.

10:48.840 --> 10:52.300
Six months after that,
Coleman came into my life.

10:52.510 --> 10:57.430
I had been living alone in a small cabin
by a lake not far from Athena.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.640
Including questions
about my private life...

11:00.810 --> 11:05.480
questions no American citizen
would ever want to answer.

11:05.730 --> 11:07.820
Still, I must take
complete responsibility

11:07.900 --> 11:11.070
for all my actions
both public and private.

11:11.150 --> 11:12.990
And that is why I am
speaking to you tonight.

11:14.110 --> 11:16.280
- As you know, in a deposition in January
- Hello?

11:16.410 --> 11:20.910
I was asked questions
about my relationship

11:21.910 --> 11:25.040
- Are you Mr. Zuckerman?
- Yeah.

11:25.130 --> 11:29.420
- Are you Nathan Zuckerman?
- Yeah.

11:29.630 --> 11:32.630
You're the Zuckerman
that's the writer, correct?

11:32.680 --> 11:36.390
- Yeah, but
- We've got to talk. May I come in?

11:37.260 --> 11:41.770
Thanks. Your last book won
some sort of prize, right?

11:41.850 --> 11:45.810
- It was short-listed for the
- That was 5 years ago. What happened?

11:45.940 --> 11:47.610
You're blocked, right?
You're blocked!

11:47.730 --> 11:49.820
You're worried you don't
have another story in you.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.280
Well, I can fix that.
I'm the answer to your prayers.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.240
- You know who I am?
- Dean Silk?

11:54.320 --> 11:56.280
Dean Coleman Silk.
That's right.

11:56.320 --> 12:00.370
The late, retired and now resigned
and unlamented Dean Silk,

12:00.490 --> 12:03.120
following the murder
you clock that?

12:03.250 --> 12:06.540
Following the murder of my wife.

12:06.670 --> 12:08.130
How's that grab you, Zuckerman?

12:08.170 --> 12:09.920
That good enough to
get your juices flowing?

12:10.000 --> 12:11.210
I'm not sure I understand.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.920
Those sons of bitches
killed my wife, Nathan.

12:14.010 --> 12:17.600
They killed my wife as if they'd taken
a gun and fired it into her heart.

12:17.680 --> 12:22.890
Yeah. Who would've thought
Iris couldn't take it

12:23.020 --> 12:27.690
as strong as she was,
brave as she was? But, uh

12:28.150 --> 12:33.320
yeah, their kind of stupidity was too
much even for a juggernaut like my Iris.

12:33.490 --> 12:34.820
Massive embolism.

12:34.860 --> 12:38.530
Pow! I got her to the hospital,
but it was too late.

12:38.660 --> 12:42.910
The point is they meant to kill me
but they got her instead.

12:43.040 --> 12:46.620
All in the name of
political correctness.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.750
There's an oxymoron
if ever I heard one.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.340
So, there's your book, Nathan.

12:51.420 --> 12:53.010
You mind if I call you Nathan?

12:53.090 --> 12:54.420
- Look, Dean...
- Just Coleman.

12:54.510 --> 12:56.220
All my other titles
I have given away.

12:56.300 --> 13:02.260
Coleman. Look, I'm sorry but I write
fiction, and at the moment I'm...

13:02.350 --> 13:05.350
Believe me this thing will read
like The Manchurian Candidate.

13:05.480 --> 13:08.190
They murdered the wrong person,
for Christ's sakes!

13:08.310 --> 13:12.070
For one word! Spooks!

13:12.440 --> 13:17.030
Spooks! It's unbelievable.

13:17.240 --> 13:20.700
Let me tell you something, Nathan.

13:21.080 --> 13:26.460
My father was a
saloonkeeper in New Jersey.

13:26.620 --> 13:30.080
Yeah, he was the only Jewish
saloonkeeper in East Orange.

13:30.130 --> 13:32.250
He only got as far as
the seventh grade.

13:32.460 --> 13:36.010
But he insisted on
the precision of words.

13:36.220 --> 13:41.220
And I have kept faith with him.
I have kept faith with him.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.390
If you don't mind a suggestion

13:43.510 --> 13:46.560
maybe you ought to write
this book yourself.

13:46.850 --> 13:48.730
Yeah.

13:49.650 --> 13:52.110
Maybe I ought to.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.610
Yeah.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.740
I guess I ought to go.
Let me ask you something

14:02.950 --> 14:07.250
Why are you hiding out here,
in the middle of the woods?

14:07.540 --> 14:11.750
- Hiding out?
- Yeah. Isn't that what you're doing?

14:16.920 --> 14:19.840
What's the moment
called in Greek tragedy,

14:19.930 --> 14:24.260
you know, the one where the hero
learns that everything he knows is wrong?

14:24.310 --> 14:28.980
It's called peripeteio or peripetia.
Take your choice.

14:29.190 --> 14:32.690
Yeah. That's me.

14:34.770 --> 14:39.150
Hey. You by any chance
play gin rummy?

14:40.780 --> 14:45.160
And this was how my friendship
with Coleman Silk began.

14:45.330 --> 14:48.040
And how I came out from
my reclusive life,

14:48.120 --> 14:52.040
living alone in
a cabin by a lake.

14:52.210 --> 14:54.960
You're divorced, huh?

14:55.340 --> 14:56.840
Does it show?

14:56.960 --> 15:00.380
Yeah, you have the look about
you of a man at loose ends.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.970
Takes one to know one.

15:03.140 --> 15:05.140
Why did your wife leave you?

15:05.350 --> 15:05.850
Which one?

15:05.930 --> 15:07.970
The first or the second?

15:08.060 --> 15:09.310
Several years ago,

15:09.390 --> 15:12.100
I had been diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

15:12.190 --> 15:14.310
Although the treatment
was successful,

15:14.400 --> 15:18.280
I had nevertheless withdrawn
to my cabin in the woods,

15:18.360 --> 15:22.990
away from the expectations and
entanglements of modern life.

15:23.200 --> 15:25.950
In the year that
followed my meeting Coleman,

15:26.080 --> 15:28.580
the time it took him
to write his book,

15:28.700 --> 15:31.580
we had dinner together
several times a week.

15:31.750 --> 15:34.880
Sometimes playing penny
a point gin rummy,

15:35.040 --> 15:40.010
sometimes listening to music that came
from a small FM station in Springfield

15:40.090 --> 15:43.680
that played big band hits from
the forties and fifties.

15:43.880 --> 15:45.640
It was during that time

15:45.720 --> 15:52.020
that Coleman dragged me back to life,
much as he had Athena College.

15:53.890 --> 15:56.610
- What's with the book?
- The book has come and gone.

15:56.690 --> 16:01.280
- Meaning?
- Meaning it's worthless.

16:02.070 --> 16:03.820
Yeah.

16:05.780 --> 16:09.620
You can't make a college
without breaking eggheads,

16:10.240 --> 16:13.330
and, I couldn't write
a book called Spooks

16:13.500 --> 16:17.250
that didn't sound like
the ravings of a lunatic.

16:17.380 --> 16:22.880
So... all this is useless.

16:23.010 --> 16:29.430
Unless you count the dubious thrill
of re-reading old love letters.

16:34.270 --> 16:36.690
Who's the girl?

16:37.150 --> 16:39.900
- That's Steena Paulsson.
- Very pretty.

16:39.980 --> 16:42.230
- Yeah.
- This you?

16:42.400 --> 16:44.400
Yeah, that's me.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.110
I met her
when I was at N.Y.U.

16:46.200 --> 16:52.370
And, it was in 1948 and I was on
the GI Bill with the Navy behind me.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.160
At that time I used to live
in the Village in those days,

16:55.250 --> 16:58.250
and I used to go into the library.

16:58.580 --> 17:03.670
It was just like fishing. I'd go into
the stacks and come out with a girl.

17:03.960 --> 17:08.970
Steena Paulsson.
Yeah, I almost married her.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.940
Hi.

17:21.819 --> 17:22.940
Hi.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.990
This book will
change your life, I promise.

17:25.069 --> 17:27.569
I can't stay long.

17:27.819 --> 17:30.910
Come on in. Just take me
a minute to find it.

17:30.990 --> 17:34.410
Oh, this is beautiful.
I have two roommates

17:34.500 --> 17:39.290
and we live in this dungeon at the bottom
of an air shaft on West 26th Street.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.630
- Would you like some coffee?
- No. Thank you. I should get back.

17:42.710 --> 17:45.130
It's just one cup.
That's all, I promise.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.800
And the, uh, the library
stays open until ten.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.180
- Sure. Why not?
- Good.

17:51.300 --> 17:55.310
- How do you take it?
- Black is fine, thanks.

17:56.560 --> 18:01.650
- So "Steena Paulsson." That's,
- what is that Swedish?

18:01.860 --> 18:04.980
Close.
It's Danish and Icelandic.

18:05.190 --> 18:09.200
- So you're not from New York?
- How could you tell?

18:09.360 --> 18:11.160
Fergus Falls, Minnesota.

18:11.280 --> 18:16.870
Well Miss Steena Paulsson
from Fergus Falls, Minnesota

18:17.000 --> 18:19.170
this is my gift for you.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.880
Tender is the Night.
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.040
He's from the Midwest, too.

18:24.210 --> 18:25.920
Thank you.

18:26.050 --> 18:28.340
You're welcome.

18:30.260 --> 18:32.680
The coffee?

18:33.140 --> 18:36.020
Coffee.

18:40.140 --> 18:41.270
What happened?

18:41.400 --> 18:43.520
- To what?
- The cut over your eye.

18:43.610 --> 18:47.280
Oh uh, boxing.
It's just a hobby.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.740
You like that sort of thing?

18:48.860 --> 18:51.160
Yes, I do.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.570
I mean, don't get the wrong idea.
It's not about strength.

18:53.660 --> 18:56.660
It's really all about
how smart you are.

18:57.410 --> 19:00.620
Are you smart. Miss Paulsson?

19:00.920 --> 19:03.420
What do you think, Mr. Silk?

19:04.080 --> 19:07.300
I think you'd make a great boxer.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.300
Good answer.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.890
Well, come on.
Let's see.

19:14.300 --> 19:16.430
- See what?
- Show me.

19:16.560 --> 19:19.230
- Show you what?
- Show me how good you are.

19:19.350 --> 19:21.060
Okay.

19:21.140 --> 19:22.850
- Okay. You're right-handed?
- Yes.

19:22.940 --> 19:25.400
All right. Put your left leg forward,
your right leg back.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.070
Bend at the knees.

19:27.150 --> 19:29.740
Okay?
Two fists.

19:29.820 --> 19:32.570
Bring your right one back by
your chin. Keep it cocked here.

19:32.660 --> 19:35.490
Left one comes out in front of you.
That's what you jab with.

19:35.620 --> 19:38.740
All right. And your thumbs
are on the outside,

19:38.870 --> 19:42.250
yeah? Okay. It's like this

19:42.410 --> 19:50.210
- Jab. Jab. Jab.
- Jab. Jab. Jab.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.090
That's pretty good for starters.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.800
Um, your right hand,
throw that in once in a while.

19:54.890 --> 19:57.050
Just to mix the other guy up.

19:57.140 --> 19:59.180
It's a right cross. Like this

19:59.310 --> 20:04.100
- Jab. Jab right.
- Jab. Jab right.

20:04.310 --> 20:07.020
- That's good.
- Jab. Jab right.

20:07.190 --> 20:10.440
- All right. The hands.
- Okay. I'm getting hot.

20:10.650 --> 20:13.450
Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.450
Nice. Keep the right
back by your chin.

20:15.530 --> 20:18.990
Okay. Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right.

20:19.030 --> 20:21.620
- Watch the hands.
- Stop moving! Jab. Jab right.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.370
- Jab. Jab right.
- That's good.

20:23.460 --> 20:26.500
Jab. Jab right.
Jab. Jab right!

20:28.380 --> 20:30.550
Did I hurt you?

20:30.750 --> 20:32.130
No.

20:37.300 --> 20:40.140
Your heart's beating fast.

21:19.090 --> 21:22.100
I can't believe this.

21:22.310 --> 21:24.600
Me neither.

21:25.020 --> 21:28.810
I guess we do things
a little differently back home.

21:29.610 --> 21:32.320
Yes, I can imagine.

21:33.360 --> 21:41.120
First, first we'd be eyeing each
other in church, on Sundays, right?

21:42.450 --> 21:46.750
And then as fall slipped into winter
and the air turned cold,

21:46.830 --> 21:54.050
there'd be sleigh rides
skating on frozen lakes

21:54.340 --> 21:57.880
singing carols around
the yuletide.

21:59.260 --> 22:04.680
You forgot logrolling
and dunking for apples.

22:10.310 --> 22:13.770
Go on, then.
Give me the straight dope.

22:13.900 --> 22:21.740
- Tell me about real American courtship.
- You're American. Jews are American.

22:35.090 --> 22:37.210
Now listen.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.220
That's Irving Berlin.

22:41.390 --> 22:46.810
I hear that and everything in me
just sort of unclenches, and the

22:47.270 --> 22:49.940
the wish not to die

22:50.940 --> 22:56.360
never to die
becomes almost too great to bear.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.520
Come on, dance with me.

23:30.600 --> 23:31.810
Come on, dance with me!

23:31.890 --> 23:33.850
- I'm not making a pass at you. Come on.
- No-No-No.

23:33.940 --> 23:36.770
Loosen up. Live a little!

23:37.360 --> 23:39.650
Take it easy. Come on,
loosen up, relax!

23:39.780 --> 23:42.110
Just don't sing in my ear,
all right?

23:43.700 --> 23:45.320
- All right, all right.
- Come on.

23:46.370 --> 23:48.580
This is good.
It's good for you.

23:50.330 --> 23:52.750
Turn around. Beautiful.

24:06.550 --> 24:09.430
Good. A little spin.

24:15.730 --> 24:17.440
Away!

24:39.090 --> 24:40.590
Get away!

24:42.550 --> 24:45.720
Really good. You're really good!

24:49.720 --> 24:51.970
I'm having an affair, Nathan.

24:52.600 --> 24:54.730
I'm having an affair with
a thirty-four year-old woman

24:54.850 --> 24:56.730
and I can't tell you
what it's done to me.

24:59.270 --> 25:02.030
I think I have
a pretty good idea.

25:02.440 --> 25:06.070
When this stuff comes back
so late in life

25:06.530 --> 25:10.910
completely unexpected
completely unwanted

25:10.990 --> 25:13.830
it comes back
with such force

25:15.210 --> 25:17.290
there's nothing
you can do about it.

25:17.420 --> 25:19.290
There's nothing
to dilute it.

25:19.420 --> 25:22.300
And when
she's thirty-four?

25:22.510 --> 25:25.220
And ignitable, Nathan.

25:25.670 --> 25:28.010
Ignitable.

25:28.140 --> 25:30.850
Ever hear of something
called Viagra?

25:30.970 --> 25:33.470
Well, without Viagra

25:33.520 --> 25:36.940
I could continue into
my declining years

25:37.140 --> 25:40.810
and still draw profound
philosophical conclusions

25:40.940 --> 25:43.570
and still have a steadying
moral influence on the young.

25:43.690 --> 25:45.650
Without Viagra

25:45.780 --> 25:49.740
I would not be doing something
that makes no sense at all

25:50.030 --> 25:53.040
something that
is ill-considered

25:54.750 --> 25:58.790
and potentially disastrous
for all concerned.

25:59.000 --> 26:04.130
Just where exactly did you
find this astounding woman?

26:04.300 --> 26:07.010
- We're closing.
- Two minutes, that's all I need.

26:07.170 --> 26:10.850
- I said we're closing.
- Two minutes, I promise.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.930
It's okay. Thank you.

26:16.140 --> 26:17.890
Couldn't wait until tomorrow, huh?

26:18.020 --> 26:21.110
No, it's my sister's birthday.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.610
Good. Thank you.

26:32.370 --> 26:34.490
Hi, Phil.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.090
Are you telling me, Mr. Starr,

26:47.210 --> 26:49.800
you believe the President of
the United States was lying?

26:49.880 --> 26:51.890
You know as a witness
when you take an oath,

26:52.010 --> 26:55.470
it's a sacred obligation
if you are a believer,

26:55.560 --> 26:59.560
that you're going to tell the truth,
and you say, "So help me, God."

26:59.690 --> 27:03.650
I mean, this is
very serious business.

27:05.900 --> 27:09.530
- You got car trouble?
- Every other day.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.070
Can I give you a lift?

27:13.410 --> 27:16.290
- Where can I drop you?
- Uh, Nickerson's.

27:16.410 --> 27:20.210
- That's the dairy farm.
- Yeah.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.830
- You mind if I smoke?
- No. Go ahead.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.420
Yeah, two dykes run it.

27:26.630 --> 27:30.550
They give me a room in exchange
for doing the milking.

27:32.050 --> 27:34.800
So you work at the post office
and the dairy farm?

27:34.930 --> 27:37.010
And the college.

27:37.260 --> 27:40.480
Faunia Farley
custodial staff.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.850
It says so on my name tag.

27:44.190 --> 27:46.150
Like to keep busy, huh?

27:46.270 --> 27:48.940
Action is the enemy of thought.

27:49.610 --> 27:51.900
Who said that?

28:04.460 --> 28:08.250
- Thanks for the lift.
- Okay.

28:30.400 --> 28:32.570
Want to come in?

28:40.370 --> 28:43.370
- You mean now?
- Mm-hm.

28:43.660 --> 28:45.500
I haven't been
this close to a woman for

28:45.620 --> 28:49.460
Since your wife died.
I know.

28:55.010 --> 29:01.180
Listen, um, we should
get something straight.

29:04.270 --> 29:11.480
If you're looking for sympathy,
you've come to the wrong place.

29:13.400 --> 29:13.860
I'm...

29:13.940 --> 29:16.820
I don't do sympathy.

29:17.570 --> 29:20.030
Uh-huh.

29:21.160 --> 29:26.920
Hey...
Whatever.

29:35.590 --> 29:40.050
- Thanks for the ride.
- Okay. Take care.

29:55.400 --> 29:58.110
Oh, God.

31:08.270 --> 31:12.100
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:13.980 --> 31:20.910
It's nothing personal, but,
uh, you got to go.

31:21.490 --> 31:23.490
I just...

31:25.370 --> 31:28.040
I don't want to wake up
in the morning and have you here, so

31:31.120 --> 31:35.380
- Like I said, it's nothing personal.
- Okay.

31:48.220 --> 31:51.190
Will I see you again?

31:55.940 --> 31:59.320
You can't much miss me.

32:10.750 --> 32:12.330
What's that?

32:12.500 --> 32:18.340
The question is
will I see you again?

33:11.030 --> 33:13.070
What are you thinking?

33:17.450 --> 33:20.250
- I'm thinking you're going to ruin it.
- No, I'm not.

33:20.330 --> 33:23.500
Yes, you are.
Just leave it alone.

33:23.620 --> 33:26.340
Don't try and get inside my head.

33:27.420 --> 33:30.010
Why do we have to talk?

33:32.630 --> 33:37.390
All right. All right,
have it your way.

33:41.100 --> 33:45.440
- I was thinking I'm a crow.
- A crow, why a crow?

33:46.400 --> 33:51.030
- Mm-mm.
- Your turn.

33:51.650 --> 33:54.660
- I was wondering what it's like making love
- Fucking.

33:54.820 --> 33:58.120
All right. What's it like
fucking an old man?

34:02.620 --> 34:07.710
It's perfect.
No surprises.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.630
What's it like
being out of a job?

34:15.219 --> 34:17.969
It's lonely.
Like you, I guess.

34:19.060 --> 34:21.469
My turn, huh?

34:21.770 --> 34:25.730
Aside from that wreck of a car,
you don't seem to have any possessions.

34:25.810 --> 34:29.320
No books, no pictures

34:29.520 --> 34:32.780
Action is the enemy of thought.

34:43.590 --> 34:44.650
All right.

34:46.830 --> 34:49.159
My life story.
Is that what you want?

34:50.900 --> 34:51.630
Fine.

34:56.310 --> 34:58.600
I grew up with a lot of possessions.

35:00.610 --> 35:05.100
My father was rich.
Real rich. Lots of servants.

35:06.480 --> 35:07.850
The whole nine yards.

35:12.590 --> 35:13.890
Don't you believe me?

35:14.390 --> 35:15.950
Mm-hm, yeah, I believe you.

35:16.390 --> 35:20.450
Then my parents got divorced and my mother remarried.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.170
The thing is, this one
couldn't keep his hands off me.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.570
Bedtime stories were his specialty.
Hey, sweetheart, let me read you a story.

35:31.410 --> 35:32.640
Next thing you know,

35:33.910 --> 35:34.930
fingers in me.

35:35.110 --> 35:36.540
You don't have to tell me this.

35:36.650 --> 35:37.770
Hey, you asked.

35:41.120 --> 35:45.680
Told my mother. She didn't believe me.
Nobody believed me.

35:46.420 --> 35:50.220
When I was fourteen, he tried to fuck me.
That's when I split. I went to Florida.

35:52.460 --> 35:54.020
Did a little of this and that.

35:59.470 --> 36:00.660
I don't know.

36:01.040 --> 36:05.170
You know,
girl like me always get by.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.280
No possessions. Travel light.

36:28.300 --> 36:29.490
Real nice.

36:46.150 --> 36:47.270
Did you hear something?

36:47.650 --> 36:50.550
Hear what? I don't hear anything.

36:53.320 --> 36:54.190
What is it?

37:02.400 --> 37:03.460
It's Les.

37:03.730 --> 37:04.760
Who's Les?

37:10.210 --> 37:11.640
He's my ex-husband.

37:14.910 --> 37:15.880
He...

37:16.450 --> 37:19.180
He follows me around. I can feel him.
He's out there somewhere.

37:20.720 --> 37:21.880
I can handle him.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.780
I used to be a pretty good boxer.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.180
Listen to me. I'm not kidding.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.550
He's out of his fucking mind.
He was in Nam. He did two tours of duty.

37:39.070 --> 37:40.660
He used to beat me up.

37:44.840 --> 37:48.330
One time it was so bad
he put me in a coma for two days.

37:50.350 --> 37:53.010
Hey. There's nobody there.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.310
I can feel him. I think he...

38:01.860 --> 38:02.880
There's nobody there.

38:03.360 --> 38:05.760
Did you ever kill anyone
in Vietnam, Mr. Farley?

38:05.860 --> 38:07.290
Did I kill anyone?

38:09.160 --> 38:13.390
Isn't that what I was supposed to do when I was sent to fucking Vietnam? Fucking kill gooks?

38:14.870 --> 38:17.030
They said, "Everything goes,"

38:18.370 --> 38:19.930
so everything went.

38:21.380 --> 38:23.870
Look, let's get something
straight right from the start.

38:24.680 --> 38:26.840
I never hurt her. Okay?

38:30.290 --> 38:31.340
Never.

38:32.490 --> 38:34.460
And I never hurt the kids.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.950
That was all lies.

38:38.990 --> 38:41.720
She never cared about anybody but herself.

38:43.500 --> 38:45.900
I should have never let her go off with the kids.

38:46.640 --> 38:47.600
She...

38:52.010 --> 38:53.570
You sure it's all right if I smoke?

38:57.610 --> 38:59.770
She waited until I was in rehab.

38:59.850 --> 39:03.720
That's why she wanted me in re-hab to start with, so she could take the kids

39:05.050 --> 39:08.280
She used the whole thing against me
to get the kids away.

39:09.930 --> 39:12.190
She had no right to steal my kids.

39:13.560 --> 39:15.830
Now she's fucking this old Jew.

39:21.940 --> 39:23.730
I should have killed her back then.

39:24.340 --> 39:25.830
This is nice.

39:26.640 --> 39:29.540
I'm sorry, madam. Smoking is prohibited in the restaurant. Thank you.

39:33.780 --> 39:37.650
I'm sorry about that.
Most restaurants seem to ban smoking.

39:38.350 --> 39:39.150
You okay?

39:40.490 --> 39:41.580
Is this okay for you?

39:43.890 --> 39:44.760
Sure.

39:46.190 --> 39:47.590
It's good food. They say.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.920
I don't know if this is such a good idea, you know.

39:53.170 --> 39:56.370
It's fine. It's a fine restaurant.
They specialize in fish and all that stuff.

39:58.170 --> 39:59.330
Sorry I'm late.

39:59.410 --> 40:01.500
Oh, hi. Hi, Nathan. This is, uh, this is Faunia.

40:01.980 --> 40:05.810
Uh, this is my friend Nathan Zuckerman and I asked him to join us.

40:06.350 --> 40:10.110
Nathan is a writer, a good writer,

40:10.190 --> 40:11.240
and uh What was that
prize you almost won?

40:11.320 --> 40:14.980
Oh, never mind, never mind.
I've been, uh, I've been teaching Coleman how to play gin rummy.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.450
Teach me? You owe me ten bucks.

40:16.490 --> 40:18.620
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

40:20.500 --> 40:22.960
What do you mean? What's the matter?

40:24.730 --> 40:27.220
Okay? I just wanted
you to meet a friend of mine,

40:28.770 --> 40:31.070
So, Coleman's told me
so much about you.

40:31.110 --> 40:35.010
Really? He hasn't
told me shit about you.

40:35.510 --> 40:38.070
What did he tell you?
That he's fucking a cleaning lady?

40:40.620 --> 40:43.740
Why are you doing this to me?

40:44.320 --> 40:47.550
You want somebody to talk to?
You have a good time. I'm out of here.

40:51.030 --> 40:51.860
I'm sorry about that.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.020
Well, you've really come down
in the world, haven't you? Huh?

41:17.290 --> 41:20.050
Dean of the college,
professor of Classics

41:22.560 --> 41:24.150
Look what you ended up with.

41:30.070 --> 41:35.370
The thing is, you can't handle fucking someone that you can't take to a fancy restaurant.

41:39.370 --> 41:40.770
Let's just end it, you know?

41:42.340 --> 41:43.830
Just end it, end it right now.

41:53.020 --> 41:54.490
You don't get it, do you?

41:55.320 --> 41:56.420
I can't.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.660
I simply can't.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.600
Turn off the fucking light!

42:51.650 --> 42:52.480
It's Les.

42:52.750 --> 42:56.680
Don't worry, I already called the cops.
They'll be here any minute.

42:58.150 --> 43:01.250
They know how to deal with him, all right?
We just have to wait.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.990
What the fuck are you doing?

43:08.660 --> 43:10.460
You can't go out there.
He's fucking crazy.

43:10.570 --> 43:11.730
Yeah, so am I.

43:12.900 --> 43:13.960
Hey, Farley!

43:14.570 --> 43:15.730
What do you want Farley?

43:16.240 --> 43:18.540
Come on out of there, you murdering bitch!

43:19.240 --> 43:21.230
- Did she tell you? Did she?
- What?

43:21.280 --> 43:26.740
Did she tell you she was giving some guy a blowjob while her kids were catching on fire, did she?
Did she tell you that?

43:26.980 --> 43:28.310
Get away from here
or I'll brain you!

43:29.120 --> 43:31.890
- Get away!
- Put that fucking thing down before I ram it through
your fucking skull!

43:31.890 --> 43:33.380
That's my wife you're fucking in there!

43:33.720 --> 43:35.090
I want to talk to her.

43:38.890 --> 43:39.950
Hi, baby.

43:42.600 --> 43:43.690
Hi, sweetheart.

43:43.930 --> 43:45.920
Go home. Come on.

43:49.800 --> 43:50.900
It's all right. I can...

43:51.110 --> 43:54.200
Come on, go home.
You hear that?

43:55.710 --> 43:56.510
- I had to call the cops.
- Ah, what'd you do that for?

43:56.610 --> 43:59.550
You're always fucking doing that.
I just want to talk to you

44:01.450 --> 44:03.180
you murdering fucking cunt.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.350
Come on, darling,
there's enough time

44:06.430 --> 44:08.190
What are you fucking
this old guy for anyhow?

44:08.310 --> 44:09.770
Get away from her.

44:09.940 --> 44:11.560
Come on.
We'll go for a ride.

44:11.730 --> 44:14.320
I'll bring you right back,
I promise.

44:15.150 --> 44:16.190
Fuck 'em.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.570
- Come on.
- No.

44:17.610 --> 44:19.990
They know me.
They're not going to do anything.

44:20.110 --> 44:22.120
I'll bring you right back,
I swear to God.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.490
I don't want to talk to you.

44:23.580 --> 44:26.450
Come on
Get your fucking hands off of me!

44:28.160 --> 44:29.420
Fuck!

44:29.500 --> 44:31.330
This is payback
for what I did in Nam.

44:31.460 --> 44:34.750
This is what I fucking get
for saving my fucking country!

44:34.840 --> 44:36.460
All the shit
I went through.

44:36.550 --> 44:38.760
I come home to
some murdering bitch

44:38.840 --> 44:41.260
treats me like garbage!

44:41.300 --> 44:44.430
Please no more of this!

44:44.720 --> 44:47.180
No more!

44:48.900 --> 44:51.200
You wanted to know why
I didn't have any possessions.

44:54.100 --> 44:55.540
I guess you found out.

45:37.910 --> 45:39.970
This is what's left of my kids.

45:42.820 --> 45:43.750
This.

45:54.730 --> 45:56.030
It was an accident,

45:56.970 --> 46:00.700
and he knows. He knows the truth.

46:02.840 --> 46:05.740
There was a... There was a heater

46:09.180 --> 46:10.110
and it...

46:12.610 --> 46:15.110
it tipped over, and the place...

46:17.620 --> 46:19.180
the place caught fire.

46:24.430 --> 46:28.690
I don't know, do I keep them? Do I bury them?

46:32.770 --> 46:35.600
I don't know. What?

46:40.080 --> 46:42.170
Got any bright ideas? Huh?

46:43.580 --> 46:45.840
Is this all
too trailer trash for you?

46:50.320 --> 46:51.110
Is that it?

46:52.420 --> 46:55.390
Get the fuck out of here. You hear me?

47:25.120 --> 47:26.780
What do I do?

47:33.630 --> 47:35.100
Please go.

47:39.030 --> 47:42.430
Please go.

48:12.070 --> 48:16.090
Everyone knows you're exploiting
an abused woman half your age.

48:17.110 --> 48:18.730
Well, if this doesn't take the cake.

48:18.840 --> 48:20.540
What's more, I know damn well who wrote this.

48:20.710 --> 48:21.400
Who?

48:21.480 --> 48:22.670
Delphine Roux.

48:23.850 --> 48:27.910
Professor of Languages and Literature. I hired her, for Christ's sakes. I hired all of them.

48:28.020 --> 48:29.350
Why would she send you something like this?

48:29.420 --> 48:33.880
I've no idea. How the hell should I know?
You're my lawyer. Send her a letter. Warn her off.

48:34.820 --> 48:35.880
She'll just deny that she ever

48:35.920 --> 48:38.760
That's her writing. Any handwriting expert will confirm that.

48:39.090 --> 48:42.930
Coleman, Listen, forget about the letter.
What are you going to do about Lester Farley?

48:43.600 --> 48:47.690
I'll get an injunction. A restraining order. I don't know.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.960
Have you any idea what you're getting into here, Coleman?

48:50.310 --> 48:52.710
You want me to fight a legal war for you on two fronts.

48:52.810 --> 48:56.400
One of them with a phantom correspondent, and the other with a lunatic.

48:56.510 --> 49:00.070
I can get you a handwriting expert. I can get you a bulletproof vest.

49:00.220 --> 49:04.550
But what I can't provide is what you're never going to know as long as you're involved with this woman

49:04.820 --> 49:08.350
A scandal-free life. Is she HIV-negative, by the way?

49:08.920 --> 49:10.720
Did you have her tested, Coleman?

49:11.660 --> 49:15.430
Did you use a condom, Coleman?
And if you don't use protection, does she?

49:15.660 --> 49:18.890
How do you know she doesn't want to use you to make up for all that she's lost?

49:19.600 --> 49:22.090
Do I represent you in a paternity suit, Coleman?

49:23.340 --> 49:25.240
Give up the girl, Achilles.

49:26.610 --> 49:29.940
I took your Intro to European Lit
umpteen years ago as an undergrad.

49:30.410 --> 49:32.940
Give her up, and your troubles go away.

49:33.920 --> 49:38.280
Faunia Farley is not in your league
and she's not from your world.

49:38.750 --> 49:41.280
Last night, you got
a good look at her world.

49:41.560 --> 49:42.520
The fact is...

49:44.090 --> 49:45.080
she ain't worth it.

49:46.830 --> 49:51.290
Achilles on Viagra. How much sense
does that make anyway?

49:53.900 --> 49:55.230
Ah, Nelson.

49:57.510 --> 49:58.850
I'm sorry, have you quite finished?

49:58.850 --> 50:00.410
Yes.

50:01.180 --> 50:04.440
Nelson, you're a genuine vocal master.

50:05.350 --> 50:09.580
And so rich with contempt
for every last human problem you've never had to face.

50:09.620 --> 50:10.610
Listen, I was only

50:10.620 --> 50:11.610
No, you listen.

50:12.090 --> 50:16.720
I never again want to hear
that self-admiring voice of yours,

50:17.290 --> 50:19.780
or see your smug, lily-white face.

50:20.090 --> 50:22.060
Coleman, use the left!

50:28.480 --> 50:30.940
Good! Good-Good-Good! Yeah.

50:32.570 --> 50:35.700
- Get out of the corner
- Finish it off, finish it off

50:36.280 --> 50:38.950
That's enough. That's enough.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.580
Next week, West Point.

50:40.660 --> 50:43.000
Oh, come on, Doc.
That guy's got five pounds on me.

50:43.160 --> 50:46.250
But he's slow.
You can take him easy.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.710
Besides, the coach of Pitt is
gonna be there. He's a buddy of mine.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.760
I want him to see you fight.

50:51.880 --> 50:53.920
- So?
- So?

50:54.340 --> 50:57.640
Once he sees your stuff, and once
I tell him about your grades,

50:57.760 --> 51:00.390
I'm pretty sure
he'll offer you a scholarship.

51:00.720 --> 51:04.190
I can't go to Pitt!
My father wants me to go to Howard.

51:04.810 --> 51:07.980
- He's an optician, your dad?
- Used to be.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.440
He lost his business in the Depression.

51:11.230 --> 51:15.110
Well, look, Coleman.
Just box for the guy, that's all.

51:15.200 --> 51:18.660
- Then we'll see what happens.
- Okay

51:19.700 --> 51:21.660
One thing.

51:22.500 --> 51:26.830
When you meet the guy from Pitt,
don't tell him you're colored, okay?

51:27.630 --> 51:30.630
- Don't tell him?
- Don't bring it up.

51:30.710 --> 51:34.550
You're neither one thing nor the other.
You're Silky Silk, that's all.

51:34.670 --> 51:37.590
- He won't know?
- How's he going to know?

51:37.720 --> 51:41.430
Here's the top kid from East Orange
High and he's with Doc Chizner.

51:41.560 --> 51:43.680
He's going to think you're Jewish.

51:55.740 --> 51:57.860
- You're late!
- I know.

51:58.030 --> 52:01.160
- Walter's home on leave.
- Hide this for me, will you?

52:01.410 --> 52:02.700
Sorry I'm late.

52:02.870 --> 52:05.160
Hey, Mom.

52:05.620 --> 52:07.540
- Walt.
- Cole.

52:08.080 --> 52:10.540
- How are you?
- Fine.

52:11.250 --> 52:14.050
So what's this I hear about
you being class valedictorian?

52:14.130 --> 52:14.960
It's all true.

52:15.090 --> 52:18.300
Hey, with the only 4.0 grade average,
who else were they going to choose?

52:18.380 --> 52:21.720
Yes, we're very proud of Coleman.

52:21.930 --> 52:25.310
- May I inquire how you did, Cole?
- How I did?

52:25.430 --> 52:27.890
Today in the boxing ring.

52:28.350 --> 52:31.770
I'm asking whether
you won or lost your bout.

52:32.020 --> 52:36.030
- Did you tell him?
- Kindly answer my question.

52:37.070 --> 52:38.950
I won.

52:39.280 --> 52:41.870
How many fights have you won?

52:44.120 --> 52:45.620
Eleven.

52:45.870 --> 52:48.410
And how many have you lost?

52:50.040 --> 52:53.420
- None.
- So far.

52:58.050 --> 53:00.050
Just when were you planning on
turning professional?

53:00.180 --> 53:03.600
- Dad, I don't think
- This does not concern you, Walter.

53:09.140 --> 53:11.440
I asked you a question, young man.

53:11.650 --> 53:15.070
Doc says I could get
an athletic scholarship.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.610
Maybe to Pitt.

53:18.990 --> 53:20.660
Like Walter,
you will go to Howard.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.990
And after Howard, should you
choose to become a doctor,

53:23.120 --> 53:24.580
you will not be doing
your hands any good

53:24.660 --> 53:28.000
pummeling them in
a boxing ring, will you?

53:32.000 --> 53:35.840
You know, Coleman, if I were your father,
do you know what I would tell you now?

53:36.000 --> 53:38.880
- You are my father.
- I'm not at all sure.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.300
I was thinking Doc Chizner
was your father.

53:42.510 --> 53:45.050
He's my coach. That's all.

53:47.970 --> 53:50.480
He teaches me how to fight.
You're my father.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.770
Well, if I were your father, do you
know what I would tell you now?

53:54.190 --> 53:56.900
I would say, "You won today. Good.

53:58.480 --> 54:01.360
Now you can retire undefeated."

54:03.660 --> 54:05.780
You're retired.

54:10.790 --> 54:14.750
If you'll excuse me,
I don't wish to be late for my train.

54:38.820 --> 54:40.320
Boy!

54:40.530 --> 54:41.530
Yes, sir?

54:41.570 --> 54:44.360
This fish is overcooked.

54:44.610 --> 54:48.950
Very sorry.
I will attend to it right away, sir.

54:55.370 --> 54:58.880
Cowards die many times
before their death.

54:59.210 --> 55:01.710
The valiant only taste
death but once.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.590
Of all the rumors that
I yet have heard,

55:04.680 --> 55:07.600
it seems to me most strange
that men should fear

55:07.720 --> 55:11.430
seeing that death,
a necessary end,

55:11.680 --> 55:14.060
will come when it will come.

55:14.310 --> 55:18.770
Clarence Silk knew well
these words from Julius Caesar.

55:18.940 --> 55:21.480
He was a man of great intellect,

55:21.610 --> 55:25.780
unflinching courage,
and an uncompromising honor.

55:25.950 --> 55:30.200
But above all else,
he was devoted to his family.

55:30.450 --> 55:35.620
His wife, Dorothy,
his sons, Walter and Coleman,

55:35.920 --> 55:38.670
and his pride and joy,
young Ernestine.

55:38.880 --> 55:43.590
Clarence Silk was
the finest man I've ever met.

55:43.670 --> 55:45.630
Coleman?

56:05.150 --> 56:09.120
You're on duty?
Tonight?

56:11.780 --> 56:15.040
It's better this way.
For me, anyway.

56:19.330 --> 56:21.790
I never knew him, Mom.

56:23.340 --> 56:25.050
Not really.

56:25.510 --> 56:28.510
I didn't have any idea
what he went through

56:29.010 --> 56:31.850
day after day after day.

56:31.970 --> 56:34.970
I don't believe
he wanted you to know, dear.

56:35.350 --> 56:36.850
He couldn't see the point.

56:37.020 --> 56:38.520
The point is

56:38.690 --> 56:40.650
if you're colored

56:41.310 --> 56:47.070
it doesn't matter how much you know.
You work in the dining car.

56:47.530 --> 56:50.660
He did that
so you wouldn't have to.

56:50.780 --> 56:54.490
Coleman, you don't have to worry.

56:54.580 --> 56:58.040
Your father's insurance
and your academic record

56:58.290 --> 57:00.830
will see to it that
you get into Howard.

57:00.960 --> 57:03.590
I heard all about
Howard from Walt.

57:03.710 --> 57:07.760
He said they're always talking
about the Negro people

57:07.970 --> 57:11.430
about "we, the Negro people."

57:12.140 --> 57:16.560
I'm not a political person, Mom.
I don't understand who this "we" is.

57:16.770 --> 57:19.100
Who do you think you are?

57:19.480 --> 57:24.520
- I know who I am.
- You need to be proud of your race.

57:24.650 --> 57:26.730
What about me?

57:27.070 --> 57:30.490
What about just being
proud of being me?

57:30.570 --> 57:34.910
It's my life. Or don't I get
any say in the matter?

57:35.160 --> 57:38.080
Coleman, I'm not clever
enough to argue with you.

57:38.330 --> 57:41.710
Then don't.
Don't let's argue.

57:44.590 --> 57:49.670
I love you, Mom.
But don't ask me to go there.

57:51.680 --> 57:56.260
Coleman, you're barely
eighteen years old.

57:56.390 --> 57:58.350
What are you going to do?

57:58.680 --> 58:00.730
Have a seat.

58:03.810 --> 58:06.270
You have a registration card?

58:06.610 --> 58:08.190
Yes.

58:37.640 --> 58:40.350
Welcome to the Navy, young man.

58:41.850 --> 58:43.810
So what did the lawyer say?

58:43.940 --> 58:45.690
He was more worried
about Lester Farley?

58:45.810 --> 58:49.150
Yeah. I don't want to
talk about Lester Farley.

58:49.280 --> 58:50.280
Anyway, I can handle him.

58:50.400 --> 58:53.570
Coleman, you yourself told me
that Lester Farley is a psychotic

58:53.650 --> 58:56.870
who's been locked up in the mental
ward at the VA hospital. Twice!

58:56.950 --> 58:58.410
Let me ask you something.

58:58.490 --> 58:59.790
What do you think would
have happened last night

58:59.830 --> 59:01.330
if the police hadn't
shown up when they had?

59:01.410 --> 59:04.830
Lester Farley is not going to just
disappear off the face of the earth.

59:04.920 --> 59:06.540
This kind of thing
is going to happen again,

59:06.630 --> 59:10.630
and when it does, next time
uh, you might not be so lucky.

59:10.760 --> 59:14.220
So... I just throw her to the wolves.
It's just like that, huh?

59:14.340 --> 59:16.470
I'm not thinking about her.
I'm thinking about you.

59:16.510 --> 59:21.020
Nathan. She's waiting for that.
To her, sex and betrayal are synonymous.

59:21.140 --> 59:25.310
Coleman, every mistake a man can
make usually has a sexual accelerator.

59:25.350 --> 59:28.980
The things that restore you
can also destroy you.

59:29.110 --> 59:30.860
Yeah, I know that.

59:31.230 --> 59:33.030
And I'll tell you something.
I don't give a damn.

59:33.110 --> 59:34.650
These things don't come without a cost.

59:34.740 --> 59:36.110
Look-Look what's happening here.

59:36.200 --> 59:38.410
People are saying that
you got her pregnant

59:38.530 --> 59:40.620
and she had an abortion
and tried to kill herself.

59:40.700 --> 59:43.870
Uh-huh. And what else
are they saying, Nathan?

59:44.040 --> 59:48.880
Hm? What else
are they saying, Nathan?

59:49.130 --> 59:50.670
Don't you look at me like that.

59:50.750 --> 59:53.420
I know this is bullshit.
I'm your friend, remember?

59:53.550 --> 59:55.090
Then act like a friend!

59:55.220 --> 59:57.680
Stop judging me,
and stop judging her!

59:57.890 --> 01:00:00.510
Jesus Christ!

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.400
So what do you want me to say?

01:00:17.610 --> 01:00:19.030
I just want you to acknowledge that

01:00:19.070 --> 01:00:22.280
something important is taking place
between me and this woman.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.740
Something that's worthy of respect.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:29.250
I guess you were right.
This really is about great sex.

01:00:29.290 --> 01:00:31.080
Oh, fuck you, too.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.920
Coleman! Coleman.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.970
Okay.

01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:48.390
Granted, she's not my first love.
Granted, she's not my great love.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:52.560
But she sure as hell
is my last love.

01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:55.230
Doesn't that count for something?

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.190
Enough to risk
getting killed for?

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.990
I'm not afraid of dying, Nathan.

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:06.740
I'm not the one who ran off to
a cabin in the woods to hide.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.480
Dance for me.

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:34.560
One dance, for me.

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.690
Sure. Why not?

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.570
Why not?

01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:54.270
This is more than sex.

01:01:55.310 --> 01:02:01.280
No, it's not.
You just forgot what sex is.

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:03.250
Did I?

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:05.000
Don't fall in love
with me, Coleman.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.960
We're just a man and a woman, in a room,
alone, right here, right now.

01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:20.220
Nothing else matters.
Don't fuck it up.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:31.660
Dance for me. Come on.

01:02:48.970 --> 01:02:51.890
You're way too young for me.

01:02:53.060 --> 01:03:00.270
I need a man much older than you.
Someone at least a hundred.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.940
You know anyone
in a wheelchair?

01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.230
I see you, Coleman.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.230
You want to know what I see?

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.250
- I see everything.
- Is that a fact?

01:03:25.290 --> 01:03:29.460
- You imagine you kept secrets from me?
- You never know.

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.380
Thank you.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:41.100
- Mr. Wilson, can you watch the register?
- Yeah.

01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:49.650
Can I help you?

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:53.860
Yes. Um...

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.400
I was looking for Rachmaninoff's
Third Piano Concerto, the, uh...

01:03:57.530 --> 01:04:00.490
- The Horowitz recording?
- Yes, that's right.

01:04:01.030 --> 01:04:02.780
Right this way.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.710
Did you go to
East Orange High School?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.790
Yes. Yes, I did.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:13.670
I thought you looked familiar.
Charley Hamilton's my cousin.

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:16.590
I haven't seen him in a while.
How's he been?

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:19.680
He's good. He's good. Actually,
I think he's getting married.

01:04:20.010 --> 01:04:24.350
Good for him.
Now the Rachmaninoff please.

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:26.680
Is that your girlfriend?

01:04:29.730 --> 01:04:33.150
Yes. Yes it is.
Look,

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:36.360
maybe I should
come back some other time

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:40.910
- and then we can talk, okay?
- Fine. Here.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.120
That'll do the trick
a lot better than Rachmaninoff.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.630
Dance for me.

01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:13.660
That has got to be
the single most sexy dance

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.870
ever danced by a girl
from Fergus Falls

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.750
in the history of the world.

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.330
I love you.

01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:25.090
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

01:07:25.170 --> 01:07:28.300
I love you. I love you.

01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:33.510
I want to spend my life with you.

01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:42.480
What are you doing Sunday?

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.020
Nothing. Why?

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.030
On Sunday

01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:50.900
we're taking the train
to New Jersey

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.530
to have dinner with
my mother.

01:07:57.830 --> 01:07:58.830
Okay.

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:00.830
Okay?

01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:03.040
I'd like that.

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:11.800
Oh, I hope she likes me.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.470
I hope the chocolates are okay.

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.180
Chocolates'll be fine.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.720
Maybe I should have gotten flowers.

01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:20.020
There was a place back
at the station I could get

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:22.689
Chocolates will be fine.
And you'll be fine.

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:23.729
Okay.

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.729
You know, this is
my old paper route.

01:08:26.270 --> 01:08:28.899
That's where I crashed my bike
into Mr. Harris' front porch.

01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:30.319
Which one?

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:34.529
Right over there.
My father made me pay for the damage.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.279
To the bike and the porch.

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:44.210
Uh... I'm scared.

01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:46.580
I love you.

01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:49.000
You know that, don't you?

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.750
I love you, too.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:55.630
Hi.

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.390
Sorry we're late.

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.890
Mother, this is
Steena Paulsson.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:04.100
Steena, this is my mother.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:07.560
How lovely. Please come in.

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.689
It's quite a beautiful city,
Fergus Falls.

01:09:10.859 --> 01:09:13.569
It's quite unusual,
because we have the Otter Tail Lake

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:16.609
and the Otter Tail River
very close to each other.

01:09:18.450 --> 01:09:23.000
My father owns a small hardware
supply store, a lumberyard there.

01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:24.910
He's the disorganized one.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.580
He cuts himself and
doesn't even bother to wash it.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:30.500
They're tough,
those Icelanders.

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:35.380
I actually didn't even know they
were called Icelanders, growing up.

01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:40.260
My mother, she's a Rasmussen.
She's the opposite.

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.970
Sets the table for Saturday dinner
at five the night before.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:49.020
I guess I was sort of caught
between the two extremes and so

01:09:49.310 --> 01:09:53.979
I decided to get away for
college out of their reach, so to speak.

01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.320
And that's how I came to New York.

01:09:56.490 --> 01:09:59.820
I've never been to the Midwest,
but I'm sure I'd like it.

01:10:00.570 --> 01:10:02.830
Coleman, wouldn't you
like to see the Midwest?

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:08.670
New York City. Final destination
Penn Station, Neew York City.

01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.960
Steena?

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.140
Honey, we're almost there.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:31.110
Honey.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:50.830
I can't do this, Coleman.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.670
I love you.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:02.640
I love you, but I can't.

01:11:21.490 --> 01:11:26.450
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
and welcome to the Saint Nicholas Arena.

01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:31.290
Tonight, in our opening battle,
from East Orange, New Jersey

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.250
weighing a hundred and sixty-two pounds,
Coleman "Silky" Silk!

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.470
A record five wins and no losses!

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:43.430
From Rochester, New York,
weighing a hundred and seventy pounds,

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:45.720
Sugar "Pete" Cunningham!

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:48.100
A record six wins, one loss.

01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:49.640
Take it easy with the guy, okay?

01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.440
Let's give the people
their money's worth.

01:11:51.730 --> 01:11:54.480
Dance him around for
three, four rounds, then go to work.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.570
Hey, kid.
Hey!

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:44.240
I asked you nicely to give
folks their money's worth.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.160
You could have stopped
the forth round instead of the first.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.950
I'm a hundred and sixty-two pounds.
He's a hundred and seventy.

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.290
I'm supposed to let him
hit me in the head

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:52.830
five, ten, extra times
to put on a show?

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:55.330
I ain't holding up no nigger.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:07.360
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:11.360
It's beautiful,
isn't it?

01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:25.250
I have to go.

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.040
Stay tonight.

01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:34.550
Mm-mm.

01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:39.550
No. I never stay.

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:45.220
Just this once.

01:15:07.110 --> 01:15:08.140
Hi. Good morning.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:15.580
Would you like some breakfast?
Uh... Eggs Benedict and ham?

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:16.880
Sit down. Please.

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:22.090
Like some coffee?

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:27.920
No milk, huh?

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.200
Okay. There you go.

01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:37.880
Looks like Monica Lewinsky isn't going to get a job in New York for the time being.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:40.370
Can't you avoid the fucking seminar?

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.250
Does fucking Monica care if my back
hurts from milking those fucking cows?

01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.320
Does she fucking care that I have to clean up other people's shit in the fucking post office?

01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:01.570
You think losing your job when you're about to retire anyway is a big fucking deal?

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:03.600
I hate to tell you.

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:07.570
It ain't.

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:12.830
Having your stepfather put his fingers
in your cunt, that's a big deal.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:21.050
Having your husband come up behind you with an iron pipe and hit you in the fucking head.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:24.080
That's a big deal.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.660
Having your two kids suffocating and fucking dying!

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.060
That is a big fucking deal!

01:16:38.610 --> 01:16:40.510
Don't you have anymore to say?

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:46.200
I knew I shouldn't have stayed.

01:16:48.180 --> 01:16:51.840
I knew I shouldn't have stayed.
It was a mistake.

01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:55.150
Even whores know better.
They know.

01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:59.120
Men don't pay you to sleep with them.
They pay you to fucking go home.

01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:26.740
Hey, Prince.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:34.590
Hey, how you doing?

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:39.800
How you doing there, my Prince?

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.020
Come here.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:46.040
Honey, it's Faunia.

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:48.670
How you doing?

01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:54.140
Did you forget me? I wanted to come and see you, but I couldn't.

01:17:56.350 --> 01:18:00.120
I haven't seen you in...
it must be three, four, months.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.710
Prince missed you.

01:18:02.890 --> 01:18:06.990
He got out the other day.
I thought he was gonna go looking for you.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:10.490
The other birds attacked him.
They would've killed him.

01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:12.560
He doesn't have the right voice.

01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:14.670
It's because he's hand-raised.

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:23.500
He's been hanging around
people like us all his life.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.810
A crow that doesn't know
how to be a crow.

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:42.920
The first time I tried,

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.400
it was a month after they died.

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:56.840
I got all dressed up.
Even my mother would have been proud.

01:18:57.510 --> 01:18:59.000
You know I called her?

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:01.140
I did.

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.820
Called her to tell her
my kids were dead.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:09.220
Mom, it's Faunia.

01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:13.760
Twenty years.
No call for twenty years.

01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:15.920
She said

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:20.460
"Oh, I don't know anybody
by that name" and hung up.

01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:24.640
Bitch.

01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:32.310
I remember the Gin, the Valium.

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:36.140
And then that rat poison was bitter.

01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:40.590
So I fold it into the pudding.

01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.660
Felt good.

01:19:53.170 --> 01:19:55.330
Why did they have to break the door down?

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.100
I mean. Come on.

01:19:59.170 --> 01:20:03.270
Even...even the nurse said-she said later,

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.940
There wasn't a heartbeat.
Not when they first showed up.

01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:11.540
Couldn't even get that right, could I?

01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:16.750
You and I...

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:20.790
were made for each other.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.300
Marry me.

01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:40.670
I think I made a mistake this morning.

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.850
Faunia Farley,
custodial staff, you know?

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:20.680
Just, uh... just doing my thing.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.860
So where were you?

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:36.330
I was starting to get worried.

01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.530
I walked around. Went to a movie.

01:21:40.410 --> 01:21:41.400
Listen, I'm...

01:21:47.810 --> 01:21:48.970
I'm sorry.

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:52.080
Everything that I said,
and everything that I did, I...

01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:53.450
You were right.

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.280
What happened to me is nothing.

01:21:57.690 --> 01:22:01.180
No. You lost everything.
You lost your wife, you lost your job.

01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:06.200
They took your life away from you
over a stupid, pissy little word. That's not nothing.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:07.320
Maybe.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:10.030
I don't think you can measure sorrow.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:18.040
I brought you these.
They're doughnuts.

01:22:19.610 --> 01:22:24.140
They're from the...
from the doughnut store. Jelly.

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:31.520
Listen, if you don't want me...

01:22:33.130 --> 01:22:38.150
If you want me to go, you know, then I understand that because...

01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:43.890
I understand and I won't blame you.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.040
What are you smiling at?

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.900
Just so happy to see you.

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:55.940
Same here.

01:22:57.150 --> 01:22:58.380
I'm happy, too.

01:23:28.210 --> 01:23:30.510
Listen, there's something I need to tell you.

01:25:54.860 --> 01:25:57.420
It seemed impossible to me

01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.160
that someone as vital as Coleman could have been killed in
what the police called,

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:04.230
a freak accident.

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:08.930
The more I thought I about it,
the more I began to feel that Coleman and Faunia

01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:12.440
could not have died without the presence, somewhere nearby,

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.550
of Lester Farley and his pickup truck.

01:26:15.750 --> 01:26:18.880
At what point did you get in
your truck that morning?

01:26:19.190 --> 01:26:20.450
Before sunup.

01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:23.180
Why did you get in your truck?

01:26:23.190 --> 01:26:23.920
To get him.

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:25.450
To get who?

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.750
The Jew professor.

01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:28.760
Why were you going to get him?

01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:29.890
Because I had to.

01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.260
You were going to kill him?

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:36.730
Oh, yes. All of us. That was the plan.

01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:38.300
There was planning, then.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:39.460
There was no planning.

01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:43.210
- Uh, but you knew what you were doing.
- Yes.

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.240
But you didn't plan it?

01:26:46.310 --> 01:26:47.110
No.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.140
Did you think you were back in Vietnam?

01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.280
No Vietnam.

01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:55.680
Were you thinking about the kids?
Was this payback?

01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.090
No payback.

01:26:57.790 --> 01:27:00.330
Weren't you trying to get revenge
to take revenge for that?

01:27:00.330 --> 01:27:01.950
No.
No revenge.

01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.730
Were you depressed?

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.700
No. No depression.

01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:09.730
Angry?

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:11.200
No more anger.

01:27:13.410 --> 01:27:15.970
But you drove your truck into their car.

01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:17.370
I didn't kill them.

01:27:20.410 --> 01:27:21.710
I didn't kill them.

01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:23.980
They killed themselves.

01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.450
What do you think?

01:27:32.730 --> 01:27:34.720
I checked with the police and

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:39.390
there are no skid marks at
the site of the accident, no sign of a collision.

01:27:43.340 --> 01:27:48.330
I think Lester Farley is delusional.

01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.430
Completely delusional.

01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.540
My name is Herbert Keble.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.980
And I am among those who...

01:27:58.350 --> 01:28:01.620
failed to rise to Coleman's defense

01:28:02.190 --> 01:28:04.660
when he was accused of racism.

01:28:06.190 --> 01:28:10.090
Coleman, I can't be
with you on this.

01:28:11.630 --> 01:28:15.960
That is what I said
to my everlasting shame.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.600
I should have spoken up...

01:28:20.370 --> 01:28:24.210
to say then what I want to say now

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:28.210
in the presence of
his former colleagues

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:34.380
that the alleged misconduct
never took place.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:38.950
Coleman Silk and his wife, Iris,

01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.320
were betrayed by
the moral stupidity

01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.790
of a censorious
and coercive community.

01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.230
And I was a part
of that community.

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:54.840
We all were.

01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:30.000
Mrs. Keble.

01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.840
My name is Nathan Zuckerman.
I was a friend of Coleman's.

01:29:35.950 --> 01:29:37.210
I thought your husband's speech was...

01:29:37.280 --> 01:29:38.650
I'm not Mrs. Keble.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:51.350
Are you?

01:29:52.460 --> 01:29:54.060
I'm Coleman Silk's sister.

01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:58.330
Iris. Nice name.

01:29:59.770 --> 01:30:01.210
And when is the happy day?

01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:03.170
June 14th.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:06.110
Have you told her?

01:30:12.580 --> 01:30:13.610
When will you?

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:22.390
You plan on bringing her home for dinner?

01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.120
I told her
my parents are dead.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.030
Dead?

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:38.270
You have no brother?
You have no sister?

01:30:39.210 --> 01:30:41.580
There's no Ernestine?
There's no Walter?

01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:46.570
I don't want to be Coleman Silk,
the Negro Classics professor.

01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:50.760
And that's how it would
always come out, Mom.

01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:54.420
You know it, and I know it.

01:30:56.130 --> 01:30:58.600
Funny, I never thought of you
as black or white.

01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:04.960
Gold.
You were my golden child.

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:09.240
Look, Mom...

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:12.540
I haven't...

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:17.550
I haven't figured
the whole thing out yet.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:19.640
Will you have children?

01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:23.240
Yes, I suppose so.

01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:29.590
You aren't going to
let them see me, are you?

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.630
My grandchildren.

01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:40.330
Mom, you'll tell me

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:44.780
sit in the waiting room
in Penn Station at 11:15 a.m.

01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:49.580
I'll walk by with my kids
in their Sunday best.

01:31:53.020 --> 01:31:55.710
That'll be my birthday present
five years from now.

01:32:01.090 --> 01:32:02.990
And you know I'll be there.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.320
But aren't you...

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:11.030
taking a risk having children?

01:32:12.170 --> 01:32:14.260
The suspense will be unbearable.

01:32:15.810 --> 01:32:18.800
Suppose they don't pop out
of her womb as white as you?

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:21.800
Won't you have some
explaining to do?

01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:28.020
Will you accuse her
of adultery with a Negro?

01:32:34.190 --> 01:32:35.680
I have to go now, Mom.

01:32:36.730 --> 01:32:37.700
Coleman...

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.190
you think like a prisoner.

01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:49.770
You're white as snow
and you think like a slave.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:30.210
Murderer.

01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:49.730
Is that the doorbell?

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:51.270
I'll get it.

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:16.620
Don't you ever come near Mom again.

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:20.860
You don't call, you don't write, you don't nothing.

01:34:22.330 --> 01:34:24.560
I never want to see your lily-white face again.

01:34:32.340 --> 01:34:34.440
And your mother obeyed Walter.

01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:37.010
All the Silk men...

01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.080
from my father on down, are very decisive.

01:34:41.650 --> 01:34:44.680
Yes, she did it.
But I didn't.

01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:49.890
I was trying to reach him two days ago.
It was his birthday.

01:34:51.160 --> 01:34:52.790
The day after he was killed.

01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:58.170
I don't blame Walter.
He was only trying to protect Mother.

01:35:00.210 --> 01:35:01.800
And was he successful?

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.670
Just before she died,
she was delirious.

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:10.080
She kept saying...

01:35:11.180 --> 01:35:12.280
Oh, nurse...

01:35:13.290 --> 01:35:17.690
get me to the train. I've got a sick baby at home.

01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:23.330
Is Walter still alive?

01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:24.690
Yes.

01:35:25.530 --> 01:35:28.800
We are all a family of teachers.

01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:32.200
Mr. Zuckerman, I wish my parents could have known that...

01:35:32.370 --> 01:35:36.470
Walter was the first colored superintendent of a school in the state of New Jersey.

01:35:37.410 --> 01:35:41.510
I guess you can tell what generation I am.
I still say "colored" and "Negro".

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:46.370
Did you know why your brother resigned from the college?

01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:49.040
I gather he was accused of racism.

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:53.520
That beats it all, doesn't it?

01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:56.590
For using the word "spooks."

01:35:58.430 --> 01:36:03.490
Sounds like from what I heard today,
almost anything goes nowadays.

01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:09.330
People are just getting dumber but more opinionated.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:12.140
You know what's sad, Mr. Zuckerman?

01:36:12.240 --> 01:36:15.040
Nowadays, it's hard to imagine

01:36:15.680 --> 01:36:19.310
that anyone would do
what Coleman felt he had to do.

01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:24.390
Constructing his whole life around a lie.

01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:29.620
Coleman could have stopped that
racism charge in its tracks,

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:32.530
if he'd only told the truth.

01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:35.460
But that's the one thing
he couldn't do.

01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:38.800
Do you think
he ever told anyone?

01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:45.840
Maybe.

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.880
Maybe someone.

01:36:52.780 --> 01:36:57.850
It was during my conversation with Ernestine that I decided to write this book.

01:36:58.990 --> 01:37:03.950
Not the book that Coleman had asked me to write, but one that he could not write himself.

01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:09.320
The story of his mother and father, of Walter and Ernestine,

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.900
of Steena Paulsson and of Faunia.

01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:22.040
Finally, there was one thing I needed to do.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.780
To face the person I was certain was responsible for my friend's death.

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:26.270
I was just driving around and saw your truck.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.410
Beautiful spot.

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.220
Peaceful.

01:38:38.690 --> 01:38:40.420
Long as I can keep it secret.

01:38:42.260 --> 01:38:43.520
Only now I know.

01:38:47.830 --> 01:38:49.230
You're the writer, aren't you?

01:38:49.330 --> 01:38:50.320
That I am.

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.170
Any luck?

01:38:53.210 --> 01:38:54.070
Not much.

01:38:59.950 --> 01:39:02.280
What do you think about out here
when the fish aren't biting?

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:06.680
I was thinking if I had a son,
he'd be out here with me now, fishing.

01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:12.020
That's what I was thinking about
when you walked out here.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.990
Don't you have a son?

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.500
No.

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:18.920
Never married?

01:39:21.270 --> 01:39:24.570
Doomed. My marriage was doomed.

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:30.730
When back from Vietnam, I had posttraumatic stress disorder.

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:35.840
I used to get in my truck and drive around for hours.

01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:39.580
My buddies were afraid that I was gonna die in a car accident.

01:39:39.650 --> 01:39:41.380
Were you ever in a car accident?

01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:43.980
I would have known if I were.

01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:47.180
Still have PTSD?

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:52.220
I still tend to isolate, don't I?
What do you think I'm doing out here?

01:39:56.270 --> 01:39:57.740
No more car accidents?

01:39:57.800 --> 01:40:00.600
Never were any car accidents. Don't you listen?

01:40:03.170 --> 01:40:04.470
What kind of books you write?

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.910
I write about people like you.

01:40:08.380 --> 01:40:09.640
Their problems.

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:15.940
You live at Mike Dumouchel's place, right?
The cabin on the lake.

01:40:19.090 --> 01:40:20.720
What's the name of one of your books?

01:40:23.230 --> 01:40:24.700
The Human Stain.

01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:27.360
Can I get it?

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:29.230
It's not finished.

01:40:34.170 --> 01:40:36.970
You know, I started ice fishing after my wife left me.

01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:44.050
All you need is warm clothes and the right equipment.

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.380
Like this auger.

01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:51.820
You drill a hole through the ice.
This'll cut through just about anything.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:55.220
Then you drop your line with your favorite lure right through.

01:40:55.730 --> 01:40:59.060
Any flash down there, fish are attracted, even in the dark.

01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:02.370
And it's way dark down there.

01:41:05.770 --> 01:41:07.260
And if I had a son...

01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:12.740
little Les, a son of my own,

01:41:14.150 --> 01:41:17.080
I reckon I'd be telling him
all this stuff instead of you.

01:41:22.750 --> 01:41:23.720
It's cold out here.

01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.310
You better believe it.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.150
I should be going.

01:41:27.330 --> 01:41:31.790
Yeah, well, you know your ice fishing now, don't you?
You can put it in your book.

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.430
I will.

01:41:34.270 --> 01:41:35.930
And you know my secret place.

01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.730
You know everything now, don't you, Mr. Zuckerman?

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.200
But you won't tell, will you?

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:52.780
And, hey!

01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:57.760
The book. Send me one.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:04.450
It's in the mail.
