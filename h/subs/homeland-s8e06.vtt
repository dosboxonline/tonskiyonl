10:13.447 --> 10:15.991
Somebody told the Taliban
where to stand with an RPG.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.076
You've got the highest
concentration in the country

10:18.160 --> 10:20.579

the President was in the air.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.122

15:22.214 --> 15:24.007
No.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.510

15:30.514 --> 15:32.140

15:32.224 --> 15:33.767

15:33.851 --> 15:37.104
It's not a hot zone anymore.

15:37.187 --> 15:40.649

is two minutes.

15:40.732 --> 15:43.694
I trust you
to protect my sources.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.946
You have to trust me
not to take advantage.

15:46.029 --> 15:48.240
Let's not push it
on the trust front, okay?

15:48.323 --> 15:50.701
You're an enemy officer,
and you're asking me

15:50.784 --> 15:53.495
to sabotage an American
intelligence capability.

15:53.579 --> 15:55.956
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

15:56.039 --> 15:57.457

16:28.655 --> 16:30.407
Three o'clock this afternoon.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.452
Two minutes.
Does that work?

16:35.621 --> 16:38.665
This is not the time
to lie to me.

16:38.749 --> 16:41.210
Honestly, I have no idea
where he is.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.212
He is in your embassy,

16:43.295 --> 16:46.590
and you will turn him over
immediately.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.884
Yesterday he was
in a CIA safe house.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.886
He left.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.180
We haven't
heard from him since.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.473
No one followed him?

16:54.556 --> 16:57.226
-No tracking device?
-No.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.102
The man who assassinated
your president,

16:59.186 --> 17:00.771
you let him go.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.982
Haissam Haqqani came to Kabul
at great personal risk

17:04.066 --> 17:05.359
in the name of peace

17:05.442 --> 17:07.486
to meet with the President
of the United States.

17:07.569 --> 17:11.240
Haissam Haqqani
came to Kabul

17:11.323 --> 17:14.701
to deceive one man, you.

17:14.785 --> 17:16.119
You believed him

17:16.203 --> 17:18.247
and brought your president
across the seas.

17:18.330 --> 17:19.790
It was not Haqqani.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.792
-And you know?
-SAUL: Yes.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.503
Hmm.
How?

17:24.586 --> 17:27.673
Because he looked you
in the eyes?

17:27.756 --> 17:30.843
People change, they evolve.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.053
Do they?

17:33.136 --> 17:35.889
I wonder what
General Ryan thinks.

17:35.973 --> 17:39.810
Do people like
Haissam Haqqani change?

17:39.893 --> 17:42.646
Yes, sir, I believe they do.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.148
Do you know the sound
a woman makes

17:45.232 --> 17:48.902
when her hand is removed
from her arm with a hacksaw?

17:50.028 --> 17:52.739
It can be heard
even over the cheers

17:52.823 --> 17:56.159
of 5,000 Taliban.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.370
Mr. President,
no one wants to see

17:58.453 --> 18:00.664
the Taliban return to power.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.833
But no one wants to see
the kind of lawlessness

18:02.916 --> 18:05.252
you presided over
in the '90s either.

18:05.335 --> 18:08.839
I reject the comparison.

18:10.257 --> 18:12.092
You just declared martial law

18:12.176 --> 18:15.220
and rounded up 300 insurgents
in a soccer stadium.

18:15.304 --> 18:19.641
To prevent them
from attacking my country.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.226
SAUL: Please.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.061
You've wanted absolute power
for 40 years.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.688
Now you have it.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.649
-Frankly, it makes me wonder.
-What?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.569
Maybe you had
the presidents killed.

18:35.741 --> 18:39.286
You'll see yourselves out.

18:47.503 --> 18:49.880

19:36.134 --> 19:37.219

19:37.302 --> 19:39.137
Mathison, yeah.
Have a seat.

19:40.889 --> 19:44.476
Mathison, special envoy.
What's that mean?

19:44.560 --> 19:46.395
Saul Berenson
brought me in a few days ago

19:46.478 --> 19:49.439
as a-a sort of advisor
in the peace talks.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.650
I worked with a lot of
the parties a few years back.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.193
You arrived in Kabul on...

19:53.277 --> 19:55.863
Uh, the third.

19:55.946 --> 19:59.783
When did you find out
the President was arriving?

19:59.867 --> 20:01.285
Yesterday...
(sighs)

20:01.368 --> 20:02.953
A couple hours
before he landed.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.372
The National Security Advisor
had a detail

20:05.455 --> 20:06.874
bring me over to Bagram.

20:06.957 --> 20:08.500
President Warner
wanted to speak with me,

20:08.584 --> 20:09.960
but I didn't know
what was going on

20:10.043 --> 20:11.253
until I was in the hangar.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.338
Why'd the President
want to speak with you?

20:13.422 --> 20:14.923
CARRIE: Um...
(sighs)

20:15.007 --> 20:16.633
Well, I was involved
in sketching out

20:16.717 --> 20:19.428
some of the administration's
Afghanistan policy.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.804
Mm...

20:20.888 --> 20:22.681
he was thanking me,

20:22.764 --> 20:25.225
which was premature.

20:25.309 --> 20:26.852
Which part of the policy?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.604
CARRIE: Um, getting out,

20:28.687 --> 20:30.564
ending the war.

20:30.647 --> 20:33.400
You know anyone around here
who didn't support it?

20:33.483 --> 20:35.485
The peace deal?
Well, a lot of people.

20:35.569 --> 20:39.531
But in this station,
n-not really.

20:39.615 --> 20:41.325
(inhales deeply)

20:41.408 --> 20:43.493
KROLL: Hmm.

20:43.577 --> 20:45.162

20:46.788 --> 20:48.498

-(softly) Yeah.

22:07.452 --> 22:09.371
It's, uh, not quite the same.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.456
It's a total fabrication.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.628
Timing's not great.

22:16.712 --> 22:19.423
I didn't want to mention it
with all this going on, but...

22:19.506 --> 22:21.592
I just knew
you needed to see it.

22:21.675 --> 22:23.177
Yeah.
(sighs)

22:23.260 --> 22:25.846
I mean, I understand
why she lied about it.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.181
She wants back in the agency.

22:27.264 --> 22:28.432
She can't get
security clearance

22:28.515 --> 22:29.766
if that's on the record.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.852
That's for damn sure.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.687
Maybe he's lying.

22:35.564 --> 22:39.193
Jenna, it was Carrie's idea
for the President to come here.

22:39.276 --> 22:41.278
-She pitched the visit.
-When?

22:41.361 --> 22:43.572
Ninety minutes
after this conversation.

22:46.617 --> 22:49.661
She was in the SCIF when
Saul laid out the peace plan.

22:49.745 --> 22:52.539
She told Warner the best way to
sell it to the American people

22:52.623 --> 22:56.210
would be here, in Afghanistan,
in front of combat troops.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.086
(sighs)

22:58.170 --> 22:59.880
Okay.

22:59.963 --> 23:03.008
But t-that doesn't mean...

23:03.091 --> 23:05.511
I have an FBI team
working out of my office.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.680
I can't neglect to mention it.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.647
I got to give it some thought.

23:19.399 --> 23:22.694

28:54.193 --> 28:55.986
All right,

29:52.918 --> 29:54.920
That's correct.

Now, I want Haissam Haqqani
in custody as much as you do,

30:03.637 --> 30:05.597

a judicial system

30:05.681 --> 30:07.641
that you've just
put on its feet.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.018
Even Taliban prisoners
need to go through something

30:10.102 --> 30:12.437

40:44.486 --> 40:47.197
your current relationship
with Yevgeny Gromov.

40:47.281 --> 40:49.324
(sighs)
Is this coming from Mike?

40:49.408 --> 40:51.451
Answer the question.

40:51.535 --> 40:52.911
(sighs)

40:52.995 --> 40:54.329
He reached out.

40:54.413 --> 40:55.873
It seemed irresponsible

40:55.956 --> 40:58.792
not to find out
what was on his mind.

40:58.876 --> 41:01.378
Even though I ordered you
to stay away?

41:01.461 --> 41:04.339
(sighs)
Even though.

41:05.632 --> 41:07.009
I didn't strap
the guy to a chair.

41:07.092 --> 41:09.303
We had--we had a conversation.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.180
SAUL: About?

41:11.263 --> 41:13.515
(exhales deeply)
Well, he has some issues

41:13.599 --> 41:15.475
with his current employer.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.020
So you're what,
bringing him in from the cold?

41:18.103 --> 41:21.023
I'm laying
the groundwork, yeah.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.609
Mike recorded the meeting.

41:23.692 --> 41:25.694
So he knows
you're lying to him.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.908
And now you're lying to me.

41:37.956 --> 41:39.958
You heard it?

41:40.042 --> 41:42.044
SAUL: Yes.

41:43.420 --> 41:45.047
All of it?

42:02.397 --> 42:04.858
SAUL: It's my fault.

42:04.942 --> 42:08.195
I put you in a terrible position
bringing you here.

42:10.364 --> 42:12.783
And I'm sorry about that.

42:14.910 --> 42:17.579
But I need to send you
back to Germany tonight.

42:17.663 --> 42:18.914
Come on.
(scoffs)

42:18.997 --> 42:20.082
SAUL: The doctors said
you weren't ready,

42:20.165 --> 42:22.251
and they were right.

42:22.334 --> 42:24.253
Can we ju--for a second

42:24.336 --> 42:26.880
not talk about me
like I'm a child?

42:29.925 --> 42:32.177
(sighs)

42:32.261 --> 42:34.263
Fine.

42:35.848 --> 42:38.517
You lied about your interaction
with Yevgeny Gromov.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.227
Let's start there.

42:40.310 --> 42:42.688
You had a relationship
complicated enough

42:42.771 --> 42:44.898
to lie about.

42:44.982 --> 42:48.485
Also, he saved your life.

42:50.028 --> 42:54.074
You don't think you carry
some sense of obligation?

42:55.242 --> 42:57.077
I get that there are risks.

42:57.160 --> 43:00.581
You couldn't possibly.

43:00.664 --> 43:03.500
You told him things
you never told me.

43:03.584 --> 43:07.421
You told him you think
you've been a danger to Franny.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.757
Is that true?

43:13.302 --> 43:16.513
Because, my God,
if it is...

43:16.597 --> 43:18.807
you are vulnerable
to him in ways

43:18.891 --> 43:21.059
neither of us can imagine.

43:32.112 --> 43:35.574
I'm still putting
the pieces together, you know?

43:35.657 --> 43:37.576
I'm not trying
to be evasive.

43:37.659 --> 43:40.120
I don't remember everything.

43:40.204 --> 43:44.875
Which is why you've been
in a recovery facility

43:44.958 --> 43:47.503
and why you are going back.

43:47.586 --> 43:50.047
CARRIE: No.

43:50.130 --> 43:52.508
Max is still out there.

43:52.591 --> 43:54.426
You understand what'll happen
if you stay here?

43:54.510 --> 43:55.928
I just talked Mike Dunne

43:56.011 --> 43:57.804
out of sharing all of this
with the FBI.

43:57.888 --> 43:59.681
Jesus Christ,
there's nothing to tell.

43:59.765 --> 44:02.059
Let him talk.

44:02.142 --> 44:05.521
You told President Warner
he should come to Afghanistan.

44:05.604 --> 44:07.981
I didn't know Warner
was gonna take me up on it.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.816
I had no idea until
I showed up at Bagram

44:09.900 --> 44:11.401
and Air Force One
was on the fucking tarmac.

44:11.485 --> 44:12.569
There was a full hour

44:12.653 --> 44:14.029
between then and the
helicopters going down--

44:14.112 --> 44:16.657
enough time
to make a phone call.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.408
To my Russian handler?

44:18.492 --> 44:19.743
SAUL: Who informs the Taliban.

44:19.826 --> 44:23.121
Then an RPG hits the President
of the United States.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.502
Do you believe that?

44:28.585 --> 44:30.212
No.

44:30.295 --> 44:32.756
But the FBI
most certainly will.

44:34.091 --> 44:37.594
And you will become
the focus of an investigation

44:37.678 --> 44:42.182
that will define
the rest of your life.

44:46.144 --> 44:47.771
I don't care.

44:47.855 --> 44:50.691
I'm not leaving Max.

44:50.774 --> 44:52.025
I won't.

44:52.109 --> 44:54.278
SAUL: You think you're the only
one who gives a shit?

44:54.361 --> 44:56.446
Max is on everyone's mind.

44:56.530 --> 44:58.782
We will do everything
we can to find him.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.576
Okay, well, that means
keeping me here,

45:00.659 --> 45:02.077
because Yevgeny
has a lead on him.

45:02.160 --> 45:03.871
He just sent word.

45:03.954 --> 45:06.331
I reached out
to him this morning.

45:10.210 --> 45:11.587
Everyone in the station

45:11.670 --> 45:13.422
was told to shake
their contacts for intel.

45:13.505 --> 45:15.007
That is what I did.

45:15.090 --> 45:16.425
The Russians have relationships

45:16.508 --> 45:17.968
with Taliban commanders
on the border.

45:18.051 --> 45:19.386
Tell me you didn't.

45:21.054 --> 45:23.265
He says he has a lead.

45:23.348 --> 45:25.684
Can I call him back, please?

45:25.767 --> 45:26.894
Carrie, think for a minute--
what would you do

45:26.977 --> 45:28.145
if you were
trying to recruit him

45:28.228 --> 45:29.938
-and he came to you desperate?
-No. That--

45:30.022 --> 45:31.398
You would do exactly this.

45:31.481 --> 45:35.068
You would tell him exactly
what he wanted to hear.

45:37.821 --> 45:40.157
So you are gonna
blow off this lead?

45:40.240 --> 45:43.452
I will have the CIA
pursue it.

45:52.252 --> 45:55.923
In 30 minutes, you will be
escorted to a plane.

45:57.508 --> 46:00.928
You will go willingly
or in handcuffs.
