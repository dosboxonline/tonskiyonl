WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:04.308
[voices speaking Sangheili]

00:06.397 --> 00:10.227
[Sangheili speech continues]

00:13.187 --> 00:15.450
[heavy, metallic thud]

00:15.537 --> 00:17.539
This is the recording
from Sanctuary.

00:19.149 --> 00:22.065
- [John] What is it?
- [Perez] A prayer.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.807
- [woman] Stand down!
- [John] Where is COBALT Team?

00:24.894 --> 00:27.375
[Perez] "I bring you blessings,
people of Reach."

00:27.462 --> 00:30.465
John-117 is relieved
from active duty,

00:30.552 --> 00:32.684
and will be confined to barracks
till such time

00:32.771 --> 00:34.904
as he clears
a psychiatric evaluation.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.732
They changed it!

00:36.819 --> 00:38.864
[Perez] "Know that
I have come without mercy."

00:38.951 --> 00:41.911
Do you have concerns
about John's mental state?

00:41.998 --> 00:44.348
All of my simulations
return the same result,

00:44.435 --> 00:46.524
regardless of any action taken.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.265
So there's nothing to be done.

00:49.962 --> 00:53.357
[Perez] "Without pity."

00:53.444 --> 00:55.751
[Ackerson] The Covenant element
hit COBALT Team days ago.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.275
We can assume the
Covenant Fleet isn't far behind.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.408
- We're not gonna fight.
- We're going to fight.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.844
We're just not going to win.

01:01.931 --> 01:03.454
Essential assets are being

01:03.541 --> 01:05.935
transported off the planet
as we speak.

01:06.022 --> 01:08.155
Can I count on you?

01:08.242 --> 01:10.940
[Perez] "Know that I am the
instrument of your extinction."

01:11.549 --> 01:12.985
I need to speak
with Corporal Perez.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.683
[Perez]
"I bring this planet forth

01:14.770 --> 01:16.685
as a burnt offering.

01:16.772 --> 01:17.729
[whoosh]

01:21.472 --> 01:22.952
Upon this altar,

01:23.039 --> 01:25.476
I place the head of the Demon."

01:27.783 --> 01:30.525
[Riz] You said there
were other ways to live.

01:30.612 --> 01:31.613
[Louis-036] That's right.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.093
Like what?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.445
[Perez] "And consecrate
the Great Journey of my people.

01:41.840 --> 01:45.888
Know that I am Var 'Gatanai.

01:45.975 --> 01:48.804
Know that I am Death."

01:48.891 --> 01:50.458
They're already here.

01:52.590 --> 01:53.852
Aren't they?

01:55.027 --> 01:57.204
[rumbling, explosion]

02:11.479 --> 02:13.002
Ooh.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.657
Got a little
late-night supper here.

02:15.744 --> 02:18.877
Hello, Benny. Uh, Jenny.

02:18.964 --> 02:21.402
Hello, Lenny.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.012
[cooing]

02:23.099 --> 02:24.361
Keith.

02:25.884 --> 02:29.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Settle down.
What's up with you guys?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.411
- There's enough for everyone.
- [explosion]

02:38.201 --> 02:39.507
[indistinct shouting]

02:39.594 --> 02:41.987
[Perez]
Go inside! Go inside!

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
- This way.
- I need to get home!

02:50.126 --> 02:51.910
- [explosion]
- [screaming]

03:02.443 --> 03:04.227
[indistinct shouting]

03:09.537 --> 03:10.755
[John] Perez!

03:14.411 --> 03:15.412
I need to see my family.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.674
No, come on.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.154
[Perez grunting]

03:18.241 --> 03:19.808
- I need to get to my family!
- Hey!

03:19.895 --> 03:23.115
Corporal! They're gone.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.987
Let me go!
I need to see my family!

03:25.074 --> 03:26.380
- [artillery fire]
- [screams]

03:26.467 --> 03:29.078
Come on! Come on!
This way! Come on!

03:33.082 --> 03:37.739
[screams and explosions]

03:46.138 --> 03:48.402
[explosions and gunfire]

03:51.883 --> 03:56.105
[opening theme plays]

04:52.901 --> 04:55.382
[low rumble; cup rattling]

04:56.731 --> 04:59.081
Don't try to tell me
you didn't feel that one.

05:01.649 --> 05:05.087
[indefinite rumble above]

05:05.174 --> 05:07.176
Something's going on out there.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.354
You're aware there's a war?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.357
In the outer colonies.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.185
Well, that's the thing
about war.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.535
It never stays
where you put it.

05:18.622 --> 05:20.581
[distant rumbling]

05:23.235 --> 05:25.063
It is good to see you, Soren.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.065
To know you're still alive.

05:29.503 --> 05:32.070
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, that's unlike you.

05:32.157 --> 05:35.030
How would you know?

05:35.117 --> 05:39.730
I've played this over in my head
a thousand times.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.430
What to say.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.217
How to say it.

05:52.526 --> 05:56.356
What I would do if I were ever
in the same room with you again.

05:59.881 --> 06:01.143
And?

06:05.147 --> 06:06.931
You're smaller than I remember.

06:08.716 --> 06:10.587
- [artillery explosions rumble]
- [gasps]

06:24.558 --> 06:27.212
[Soren] There's your upside.

06:27.299 --> 06:29.258
The field perimeter
may still be charged.

06:29.345 --> 06:30.694
It's more than enough
to kill you, Soren!

06:35.438 --> 06:36.831
See you around.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.706
[Perez]
What about these people?

06:42.793 --> 06:44.665
- We have to tell them.
- [John] No time.

06:47.711 --> 06:48.886
[soft sobs]

06:51.715 --> 06:53.369
Focus on the mission.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.719
Stay alert. Do your job.

06:55.806 --> 06:57.721
Those weren't Marines, okay?

06:58.592 --> 07:01.072
This was my family! My friends!

07:02.422 --> 07:04.641
There's no training for this.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.166
Do you get it?

07:09.951 --> 07:11.126
Do you?

07:16.174 --> 07:18.394
I need to get back to FLEETCOM.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.961
Find my gear.

07:20.048 --> 07:21.832
Link up with
the defensive force.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.618
You don't have to come.

07:26.315 --> 07:31.059
[indistinct PA announcement]

07:31.146 --> 07:32.974
[breathing heavily]

07:34.149 --> 07:35.672
[indistinct chatter]

07:40.372 --> 07:41.548
Keep moving.

07:45.552 --> 07:47.510
- We need to get out of here.
- What?

07:47.597 --> 07:49.556
They're coming.
You need to get out of here.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.732
You need to get out of here!
It's not safe!

07:51.819 --> 07:53.995
You gotta leave, come on!
You need to get out of here!

07:54.082 --> 07:55.736
- You need to get out of here.
- Perez!

07:55.823 --> 07:57.302
FLEETCOM. Now.

07:57.912 --> 08:00.044
- They need to know. They need--
- No.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.655
[indistinct shouting]

08:04.658 --> 08:06.834
- Hey!
- [screams]

08:10.620 --> 08:11.969
[window smashes]

08:12.056 --> 08:13.754
[grunts]

08:19.324 --> 08:20.717
[growls]

08:31.815 --> 08:33.251
[metal clatters]

08:35.602 --> 08:37.342
[both grunt]

08:37.429 --> 08:38.779
[Perez yells]

08:44.785 --> 08:46.264
[yells]

08:48.310 --> 08:49.659
[Perez] Chief!

08:52.923 --> 08:57.449
[civilians screaming
and shouting]

08:57.537 --> 08:59.234
[John] This way! Come on!

09:05.414 --> 09:07.547
[alarm beeping]

09:10.680 --> 09:12.726
If you want to get out,
it's this way.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.556
I know this place. Trust me.

09:17.078 --> 09:19.036
That's not gonna happen.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.778
Suit yourself.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.826
Shit.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.744
- [artillery fire]
- [distant screaming]

09:32.267 --> 09:33.964
[explosions]

09:37.881 --> 09:39.709
- [panting]
- Come on!

09:39.796 --> 09:41.015
In here.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.062
[door closes]

09:48.936 --> 09:52.156
- [whispers] Are they coming?
- [shushes]

09:52.243 --> 09:54.376
[deep voices speaking
indistinctly]

09:59.903 --> 10:01.862
Relax.

10:04.386 --> 10:05.866
You relax.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.702
I watch you.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.923
All that plasma flying.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.623
Death all around you and...

10:24.711 --> 10:26.103
you never...

10:28.976 --> 10:30.804
When I was a kid,

10:30.891 --> 10:33.284
there was this woman.

10:33.371 --> 10:34.938
She flipped a coin.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.855
She dared me to call it,
and I did.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.510
Heads.

10:41.597 --> 10:43.381
Eleven times in a row.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.863
- Lucky.
- Maybe.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.866
But I wasn't guessing.

10:50.780 --> 10:52.042
I knew.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.219
It's always been like that.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.920
Every time I go into battle,
I know I can lose somebody.

11:00.007 --> 11:01.748
I know it's not gonna be me.

11:05.534 --> 11:06.927
Must be nice.

11:07.797 --> 11:08.798
Not really.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.801
[glass shatters]

11:11.888 --> 11:13.150
Shh.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.467
- [gunshot]
- [Perez gasps]

11:25.554 --> 11:27.034
[Perez] Shit.

11:27.121 --> 11:29.950
Oh. Please be careful with that.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.169
[John] Ma'am?

11:32.256 --> 11:36.217
That axe is over 600 years old.

11:37.131 --> 11:39.220
Someone on Earth
cut trees with it.

11:40.438 --> 11:42.049
Used the wood for fuel.

11:48.446 --> 11:49.839
You. Big man.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.667
That typewriter.

11:51.754 --> 11:54.409
It's too heavy for me.

11:54.496 --> 11:56.106
Ma'am, the city's under attack.

11:56.193 --> 11:57.673
You don't say.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.371
Well, be useful.
The typewriter, up there.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.156
You need to get out of here.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.811
[Jade] This is my shop.

12:04.898 --> 12:08.162
Same place for 40 years,
give or take.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.033
Look, top shelf, please.

12:12.209 --> 12:14.603
[John]
The corporal's right, ma'am.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.779
This location is not secure.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.216
We're on our way to FLEETCOM.
We can take you with us.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.133
And who'll look after
all my stuff?

12:23.220 --> 12:27.747
Ma'am, all of this
doesn't matter.

12:29.966 --> 12:33.274
That's an Underwood
standard portable.

12:33.361 --> 12:34.928
Twentieth century.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.234
Hartford, Connecticut.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.759
That's Earth, dear.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.239
It's seen six wars.

12:42.326 --> 12:46.330
Fought communism, fascism,
all the isms in between.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.550
And it survived.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.944
Now, if that doesn't matter...

12:51.031 --> 12:54.599
The Covenant is
on the way, ma'am.

12:54.686 --> 12:57.167
People nowadays
talk like nothing matters.

12:58.386 --> 13:00.954
Who are we?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.217
If nothing matters,
then we don't matter.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.872
Ma'am, they're gonna
glass the planet.

13:05.959 --> 13:08.483
Nothing will survive.
You will not survive.

13:08.570 --> 13:09.789
Do you understand?

13:11.312 --> 13:12.922
Do you understand?

13:15.142 --> 13:17.535
- Ma'am, do you understand?
- She understands.

13:19.407 --> 13:20.582
Come.

13:23.977 --> 13:27.067
- [artillery explosions]
- [dirt sifts]

13:31.636 --> 13:32.986
[door closes]

13:35.379 --> 13:37.729
What is this?
Your secret dungeon?

13:38.513 --> 13:40.036
Incarceration is
a secondary purpose.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.082
It's principally
an experimentation

13:42.169 --> 13:43.605
and interrogation site.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.389
ONI access only.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.478
[sighs] So, like a dungeon.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.091
[muffled explosion]

13:51.178 --> 13:52.875
They're getting closer.

13:52.962 --> 13:56.313
Tell me, what's Kessler like?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.794
How old is he?
He must be 9 or 10?

13:58.881 --> 14:01.101
- I bet he worships you.
- Stop.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.580
When you were that age,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.452
you were always
trying to slip away.

14:04.539 --> 14:06.062
Climbing, tunneling.

14:06.149 --> 14:07.716
I don't want to talk to you
about my son.

14:07.803 --> 14:09.936
[Halsey] Well, that's what
parents talk about,

14:10.023 --> 14:11.676
or so I'm told.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.330
You had a child.

14:13.417 --> 14:16.203
So, naturally, I'm curious
to know how much of you

14:16.290 --> 14:18.248
has found its way into him.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.555
My interest
is purely scientific.

14:20.642 --> 14:21.904
Bullshit.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.298
Do you even know
where we're headed?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.213
Yes, of course I do.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.563
I remember...

14:30.434 --> 14:32.349
you were the most driven.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.482
The others had to be recruited.

14:34.569 --> 14:36.397
- Kidnapped.
- But you wanted it.

14:36.484 --> 14:38.747
Right from the very
first time I saw you.

14:38.834 --> 14:41.141
You wanted to be a Spartan.

14:42.403 --> 14:44.666
- I was 6.
- Yes, you were 6.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.886
And you already knew
your purpose.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.236
So did I.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.108
You were a born warrior.

14:52.804 --> 14:55.851
- Even after your accident, you--
- My what?

14:55.938 --> 14:57.244
Your arm.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.161
It was very difficult
to let you go.

15:01.248 --> 15:02.902
Let me go?

15:02.989 --> 15:04.468
I escaped you.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.079
I survived you.

15:07.428 --> 15:08.908
I made a life...

15:11.432 --> 15:12.912
in spite of you.

15:14.043 --> 15:15.001
Hmm.

15:16.741 --> 15:19.135
I suppose that's
as good a story as any.

15:31.539 --> 15:32.801
[softly]
Oh, shit.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.150
Plasma.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.369
Plasma?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.633
- They're here.
- Take this.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.983
And try not
to shoot me in the back.

15:41.070 --> 15:42.506
No promises.

15:46.336 --> 15:48.121
[machine-gun fire]

15:51.037 --> 15:52.516
Stay low!

15:52.603 --> 15:54.127
[man] Go, go, go!

15:54.214 --> 15:55.955
[man screams]

15:57.043 --> 15:58.609
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.351
Oh, my God.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.181
[John] They're evacuating
people from FLEETCOM.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.489
We're no good here.

16:08.576 --> 16:11.274
- Go, go, go, go!
- [man] Hey!

16:11.361 --> 16:13.059
- [explosion]
- [man screams]

16:14.712 --> 16:16.366
Riz!

16:16.453 --> 16:18.847
I hope you don't mind,
we got started without you!

16:18.934 --> 16:21.067
- I need a weapon!
- Help yourself.

16:24.548 --> 16:27.377
- You good?
- I am now.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.118
Trying to get to FLEETCOM.

16:29.205 --> 16:31.816
Ran into about 20 Elites.
They just keep coming.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.383
Any contact
with the other units?

16:33.470 --> 16:35.211
No, they took out
the comms first.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.431
[Louis-036] I hear you.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.173
Keep making that noise.
I'll find your ass.

16:40.260 --> 16:42.262
We gotta move!

16:42.349 --> 16:44.960
Any idea how we're gonna get
around this Covenant position?

16:45.047 --> 16:46.657
We're not going around.

16:46.744 --> 16:49.530
All right. Give me five Marines.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.749
The rest of you are gonna
lay down cover fire

16:51.836 --> 16:53.534
while we traverse to
the defilade by the bridgehead.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.144
[Marines]
Yes, ma'am!

16:55.231 --> 16:57.625
Once we get inside,
everybody else fall back!

16:57.712 --> 16:59.192
[man] To where, sir?

16:59.279 --> 17:00.889
Wherever you're needed.
Just not here.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.499
[man]
Yes, sir!

17:02.586 --> 17:04.632
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm going with you.

17:04.719 --> 17:06.851
- No, Louis, you're not.
- I don't need your permission.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.810
I'm coming too.
I can help with the wounded.

17:08.897 --> 17:10.072
Okay, let's go.

17:10.638 --> 17:12.466
- Hey, you ready?
- On your go.

17:12.553 --> 17:15.338
Cover fire! Ready? Go!

17:15.425 --> 17:16.644
[Marine 1]
You and you with me!

17:16.731 --> 17:18.080
[Marine 2] We got him!

17:18.167 --> 17:19.647
Go! Go! Go!

17:19.734 --> 17:21.388
[Riz] Come on! Keep moving!

17:22.476 --> 17:23.738
Three o'clock!

17:25.740 --> 17:28.090
[indistinct shouting]

17:28.177 --> 17:29.439
[Danilo] Louis!

17:33.835 --> 17:35.054
[Riz] Louis!

17:35.141 --> 17:36.490
[Louis-036] Stay low! Move!

17:36.577 --> 17:39.754
[John]
Move! Go! Go, go, go!

17:39.841 --> 17:41.451
[gunfire]

17:47.153 --> 17:48.763
[artillery explosions]

17:48.850 --> 17:50.330
Moving! Let's go!

17:54.725 --> 17:56.814
[all yell]

17:56.901 --> 17:58.947
[roaring and snarling]

17:59.034 --> 18:00.514
[Riz] Contact rear!

18:07.651 --> 18:09.218
- [John] Reloading!
- [Riz] Covering.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.529
- [snarling]
- Frag out!

18:18.880 --> 18:20.229
[man screams]

18:23.798 --> 18:24.799
[John] This way!

18:24.886 --> 18:26.540
On me!

18:26.627 --> 18:28.063
Go! Go! Go!

18:28.150 --> 18:29.760
Go! Go! Go! Go!

18:33.982 --> 18:36.202
[distant shouting and gunfire]

18:40.162 --> 18:42.425
[pin clicks]

18:42.512 --> 18:43.992
[grenade clatters]

18:44.079 --> 18:45.385
[snarling]

18:48.083 --> 18:49.519
[grunts]

18:52.087 --> 18:53.610
[groans]

18:56.178 --> 18:58.311
We gotta move. Let's go!

18:59.877 --> 19:01.270
We're good.

19:02.967 --> 19:04.186
Where's Danilo?

19:05.274 --> 19:07.581
Where's Danilo?

19:07.668 --> 19:09.670
Riz! Where's Danilo?

19:09.757 --> 19:11.541
[panting]

19:11.628 --> 19:13.195
He's not coming.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.895
- [John] Wraith!
- [Perez] Wraith!

19:19.201 --> 19:20.811
[John] Get some cover fire!

19:24.250 --> 19:25.555
- [Louis-036] Come on!
- [Riz] Louis!

19:25.642 --> 19:26.600
[Louis-036]
You want this?

19:29.168 --> 19:30.212
[John] Gotta move!

19:32.867 --> 19:33.781
You'd better go.

19:37.872 --> 19:39.613
Come with me.

19:39.700 --> 19:40.483
No.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.356
I'm right where I need to be.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.576
[John] Go! Go! Go!

19:46.663 --> 19:47.969
I'm right here!

19:48.056 --> 19:49.318
[Riz] Louis!

19:50.014 --> 19:52.191
[Louis-036]
Come on!

19:52.278 --> 19:53.627
I got something for you!

19:53.714 --> 19:55.672
No! Louis!

19:57.196 --> 19:58.240
[impact grunt]

20:08.816 --> 20:09.817
Riz.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.345
We gotta go.

20:30.359 --> 20:31.839
[Soren]
What the hell is this place?

20:31.926 --> 20:34.145
[Halsey] We're not the only
prisoners here.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.713
[Soren] I thought you said
you knew a way out of here.

20:39.368 --> 20:40.761
[Halsey] Cortana?

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
- Dr. Halsey.
- Yes.

20:48.464 --> 20:49.422
Run.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.643
[ominous music]

21:04.654 --> 21:06.003
[Soren] Get back!

21:09.485 --> 21:11.008
[Halsey screams]

21:11.792 --> 21:13.054
Move!

21:14.316 --> 21:15.752
[grenade clatters]

21:16.840 --> 21:18.451
[explosion]

21:20.757 --> 21:22.498
[indistinct chatter]

21:36.947 --> 21:39.385
[muffled screams]

21:40.299 --> 21:42.431
Riz, get suited up.

21:46.696 --> 21:47.697
Riz!

21:49.482 --> 21:50.831
Let's go.

21:52.746 --> 21:54.225
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.444
Is that it?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.622
Are you just gonna go off
to fight

21:59.709 --> 22:01.363
without saying anything?

22:04.105 --> 22:07.326
Okay, well... thanks.

22:13.506 --> 22:15.769
Corporal.

22:15.856 --> 22:16.683
For luck.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.078
Heads.

22:21.165 --> 22:23.516
Sorry to ruin
your day off, Chief.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.953
[chuckles]
Well, I'm happy to see you.

22:26.040 --> 22:27.694
I've been clearing out
the lower levels.

22:27.781 --> 22:29.478
Few of those cloaked Elites
snuck in

22:29.565 --> 22:31.132
before the barricades went up.

22:31.219 --> 22:33.003
I'm almost sick
of killing aliens.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.614
Almost.

22:34.701 --> 22:36.833
- Hey, Riz, you all right?
- Where's Kai?

22:36.920 --> 22:39.575
I was gonna ask the same thing.
She must still be out there.

22:39.662 --> 22:41.708
Well, if I know Kai,
she went hunting.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.274
We should do the same.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
We're just going
to get suited up.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.583
The armor's gone, chief.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.718
What did you say?

22:51.805 --> 22:54.285
[Vannak]
Our suits. The armor.

22:54.938 --> 22:56.723
- It's not there.
- Son of a bitch.

22:57.898 --> 23:00.161
- Where's Ackerson?
- [Vannak] I don't know.

23:00.248 --> 23:01.336
Command bugged out.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.859
They took
high-ranking personnel.

23:02.946 --> 23:05.427
- Valuable assets.
- They took our suits.

23:05.514 --> 23:07.255
Chief, what the hell's going on?

23:07.342 --> 23:08.648
Who's in command?

23:12.521 --> 23:14.828
- Get us more kit.
- [Vannak] Roger that.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.831
[indistinct chatter]

23:21.400 --> 23:23.750
Reduce rate of the salvos,
buy us a little more time.

23:23.837 --> 23:25.708
Copy that, sir.

23:25.795 --> 23:27.580
[John] Admiral.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.756
I want as many of those bastards
on the bridge as possible

23:29.843 --> 23:30.844
before you blow it.

23:30.931 --> 23:31.932
I'm on it, sir.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.370
They took our suits.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.547
You know, part of me was hoping
that you were dead,

23:38.634 --> 23:40.462
so I wouldn't have to listen
to this "I told you so."

23:41.115 --> 23:42.856
No such luck, sir.

23:44.379 --> 23:45.598
Sorry, John.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.775
You were right.

23:48.862 --> 23:51.081
Cobalt was KIA at Visegrad.

23:51.168 --> 23:52.648
I saw the bodies myself.

23:53.997 --> 23:55.390
They never knew what hit them.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.872
Two of their weapons
had full mags.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.526
Didn't get a shot off.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.921
When Visegrad went down,
it left a blind spot.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.837
There's no way of knowing
how many Covenant landed.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.752
It's a ground game for now.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.102
They're hitting
the power stations.

24:12.189 --> 24:14.583
We're defending the ones
that we can, but without them--

24:14.670 --> 24:16.890
- MAC-array goes down.
- That's right.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.369
No more orbital defense.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.197
The Covenant fleet
can move into range.

24:20.284 --> 24:22.330
- Then the glassing begins.
- That's about the size of it.

24:22.417 --> 24:24.419
Tyrell, Scorpion
in the east hangar.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.552
- Let's get it on the bridge.
- [Tyrell] Yes, sir.

24:27.553 --> 24:29.424
What about our fleet?
Where are they?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.600
I believe the determination
was made to preserve

24:31.687 --> 24:33.210
our most essential
military assets.

24:33.297 --> 24:35.212
What?

24:35.299 --> 24:36.692
Just let Reach fall?

24:36.779 --> 24:38.259
They knew this was gonna happen.

24:38.346 --> 24:39.913
They saw it coming,
they did the math.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.349
Who?

24:41.436 --> 24:43.133
I don't know.
The powers that be.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.005
The Admiralty. The ONI.
Take your pick.

24:45.092 --> 24:46.833
- Ackerson?
- Yeah.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.924
Doesn't change
the situation here.

24:51.011 --> 24:52.491
Let me be clear John.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.362
I don't give a shit about
their calculations.

24:54.449 --> 24:57.539
I'm gonna make the Covenant pay
for every inch of this planet.

24:57.626 --> 25:01.630
Our mission now is to evacuate
as many people as we can.

25:01.717 --> 25:03.545
Where do you want me, sir?

25:08.898 --> 25:10.465
We're creating a choke point.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.947
We're outnumbered, but if we
can concentrate our forces--

25:14.034 --> 25:15.470
I get it, sir.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.732
Thermopylae.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.128
[soft groan]

25:23.043 --> 25:24.523
My ears.

25:25.219 --> 25:26.916
[Soren] Grenades will do that.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.664
Can I have my hand back?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.667
What do you mean, you let me go?

25:38.754 --> 25:41.104
Do you have any idea
what just happened in there?

25:41.191 --> 25:43.150
Our enemy is in possession
of Cortana.

25:43.237 --> 25:46.283
What did you mean?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.200
I saw your potential.

25:50.287 --> 25:52.855
Your strength, your focus.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.465
They all looked to you.

25:54.553 --> 25:55.902
John looked to you.

25:56.990 --> 26:00.602
After your augmentation failed,
I needed him to look to himself.

26:03.213 --> 26:04.388
No.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.826
No, that's not what happened.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.871
Why do you think there was
no one guarding the ships

26:08.958 --> 26:10.612
the night you ran away?

26:12.745 --> 26:14.311
[explosion and gunshots]

26:14.398 --> 26:16.226
We need to get up there now!

26:18.751 --> 26:20.970
[grim music plays]

26:23.799 --> 26:25.627
[indistinct shouting]

26:36.986 --> 26:38.205
Hey!

26:39.336 --> 26:40.381
[medic] Hey!

26:40.468 --> 26:41.817
Help me with that one!

26:43.471 --> 26:44.994
[Perez] What do I do?

26:45.081 --> 26:47.083
We've got to get these people
out of here.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.477
Transports are leaving
from the upper hangar.

26:49.564 --> 26:50.652
[woman] Right this way.

26:50.739 --> 26:51.914
This way.

26:53.394 --> 26:54.743
It's okay.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.572
I got you.

26:57.659 --> 26:59.574
[man] Clear the way!
Coming through! Coming through!

26:59.661 --> 27:00.662
Clear the way!

27:00.749 --> 27:04.666
[indistinct PA announcement]

27:04.753 --> 27:06.015
John.

27:07.364 --> 27:09.105
What are your orders, sir?

27:10.890 --> 27:12.718
Hold my hat.

27:17.070 --> 27:18.245
Gunny.

27:18.332 --> 27:20.247
Attention all on deck!

27:23.163 --> 27:24.730
Bring it in.

27:24.817 --> 27:26.906
[Marine]
Front and center! Double time!

27:29.822 --> 27:31.084
Move it!

27:35.523 --> 27:36.829
You know what I see?

27:39.266 --> 27:41.050
I see some hard-ass Marines.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.402
What I do not see is doubt.

27:45.489 --> 27:48.362
I do not see defeat
in this room.

27:48.449 --> 27:50.886
And I do not see surrender.

27:50.973 --> 27:52.845
[all] No, sir!

27:54.673 --> 27:56.413
[Keyes]
When I look at your faces,

27:56.500 --> 27:58.894
I see the very best
of who we are as a people.

28:01.462 --> 28:05.422
You fought with courage.
You fought with heart.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.859
You fought with love

28:06.946 --> 28:08.687
for your brothers and sisters
in arms.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.734
There's nothing left
for any one of you to prove.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.738
You're the finest Marines
I've ever seen.

28:18.087 --> 28:19.088
And you deserve the truth.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.267
The enemy is at our gates.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.443
Their numbers are overwhelming.

28:28.141 --> 28:30.883
We will not be able
to hold them back forever.

28:34.190 --> 28:36.715
Any Marine who makes
this stand with us...

28:38.978 --> 28:40.980
will not survive the day.

28:47.377 --> 28:50.163
But you will not
make that stand alone.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.251
John?

28:52.556 --> 28:53.993
John?

29:00.434 --> 29:04.525
It is my honor to introduce
to you John-117.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.874
You know him as Master Chief.

29:06.396 --> 29:08.355
[whispering]

29:09.704 --> 29:12.533
Today, he needs no armor.

29:12.620 --> 29:17.668
Today, all he needs
is the warrior inside of him.

29:17.756 --> 29:20.236
And it's the same warrior
that's in each of you.

29:20.933 --> 29:24.327
The one that is willing to lay
down your life for your home.

29:25.502 --> 29:28.679
For every moment
that we hold the enemy at bay,

29:28.767 --> 29:32.640
more innocent people
can escape on the transports.

29:32.727 --> 29:36.078
And when they do,
they will go forth

29:36.731 --> 29:38.864
and tell the story
that you write today.

29:39.821 --> 29:44.260
You will be remembered
as the brave women and men

29:44.826 --> 29:48.830
who laid down their lives
so that one day our children

29:48.917 --> 29:52.834
may live without fear
of this monster we call war.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.798
Now, show those scaly bastards

29:59.885 --> 30:02.191
they fucked
with the wrong planet!

30:02.278 --> 30:04.193
[cheers]

30:08.894 --> 30:10.243
[sergeant] Fall out!

30:10.330 --> 30:11.592
Take your positions!

30:11.679 --> 30:14.073
[officer] Fall out! Formation!

30:14.160 --> 30:15.422
[Marine] Semper fi!

30:21.907 --> 30:24.213
[Keyes] I am glad you're here.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.128
- Yes, sir.
- No, John.

30:27.173 --> 30:28.217
It matters.

30:29.131 --> 30:31.003
[sergeant]
Your comms, sir.

30:31.090 --> 30:32.221
Comms, Admiral.

30:35.311 --> 30:36.660
What are you doing?

30:36.747 --> 30:38.271
What does it look
like I'm doing?

30:38.358 --> 30:40.186
Stripes don't mean shit today.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.841
- Get me my gun.
- [John] No, sir.

30:42.928 --> 30:46.018
We can't afford to lose you.
This won't be the end.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.889
There's more fight
to come after this.

30:47.976 --> 30:49.804
We're gonna need good people
like you to lead us.

30:49.891 --> 30:52.024
John, I'm still giving
the orders here.

30:52.111 --> 30:54.069
[John] And we need you
to keep giving the orders,

30:54.156 --> 30:56.028
or else it's gonna be people
like Ackerson.

30:56.115 --> 30:59.379
Now please, get those civilians
out of here.

31:02.382 --> 31:04.123
What about you?

31:05.559 --> 31:07.343
I'm where I'm supposed to be.

31:08.779 --> 31:10.129
[soft chuckle]

31:17.266 --> 31:18.572
Make it count.

31:20.052 --> 31:21.618
You bet your ass, sir.

31:29.757 --> 31:31.628
Get this ammo
evenly distributed.

31:31.715 --> 31:34.153
[shouting and gunfire]

31:37.199 --> 31:39.332
- Right here, guys.
- [Marine 1] Yes, sir.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.899
[Marine 2] Lock and load!

31:40.986 --> 31:42.726
[John] Tyrell.

31:42.813 --> 31:43.945
Got your fire team set?

31:44.032 --> 31:46.295
Roger that, Master Chief.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.471
- Fire team!
- All right, then.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.170
[Tyrell]
Maintain your sectional fire!

31:52.345 --> 31:54.129
[gunfire]

31:58.177 --> 32:00.092
[indistinct radio chatter]

32:01.658 --> 32:03.182
[John] Guns are out.

32:07.490 --> 32:10.015
[Marine] Somebody get me
vis on that bridgehead!

32:11.581 --> 32:12.626
[Vannak]
Here they come.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.162
Hello, Jacob.

32:27.902 --> 32:29.034
Catherine.

32:30.339 --> 32:32.733
And...

32:32.820 --> 32:34.343
Soren.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.828
I hate to interrupt
whatever the hell this is,

32:40.915 --> 32:42.047
but could either of you point me

32:42.134 --> 32:44.092
in the quickest way
off this hellhole?

32:44.179 --> 32:47.791
There's a civilian transport
leaving from the upper hangar.

32:47.878 --> 32:48.967
[Soren] I'm a civilian.

32:49.054 --> 32:50.403
You're a pirate.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.451
Small business owner.

33:02.806 --> 33:04.286
[distant gunfire]

33:06.332 --> 33:08.029
[Vannak]
Where the hell are they?

33:13.774 --> 33:16.124
Scorpion-Three X-Ray,
this is Silver-One.

33:16.211 --> 33:17.952
[man, over radio]
Go ahead, Silver. Over.

33:18.039 --> 33:20.302
Give me one round of white phos
on that bridgehead, over.

33:20.389 --> 33:21.956
Copy. One round, Willy Pete.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.914
Sending it. Over.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.091
That'll wake 'em up.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.311
[explosion]

33:29.398 --> 33:30.791
[roaring]

33:30.878 --> 33:33.054
Oh, shit. Light 'em up!

33:38.973 --> 33:40.409
Is Miranda here?

33:42.498 --> 33:44.500
No. Thank God.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.679
Where is she?

33:49.766 --> 33:51.594
Sorry, I can't say.

33:51.681 --> 33:54.249
Get a room.

33:54.336 --> 33:57.296
What exactly are you doing
with this...

33:58.688 --> 33:59.950
person?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.344
Three minutes ago,
I was a pirate.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.261
I'm making progress.

34:07.828 --> 34:08.698
They have Cortana.

34:11.005 --> 34:13.355
- The Covenant?
- [Halsey] I saw them take her.

34:13.442 --> 34:15.879
A Sangheili and Makee.

34:15.966 --> 34:18.230
[Marines shouting indistinctly]

34:19.753 --> 34:21.146
Makee's dead.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.495
Apparently not.

34:25.672 --> 34:28.153
Corporal, get these people
on this ship.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.024
Trying, sir.
Come on, come on, come on.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.591
Come on!
Every second counts!

34:31.678 --> 34:34.115
Come on, come on.
Faster! Come on, come on, guys!

34:35.290 --> 34:36.291
Come on, come on, come on.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.163
Is this the last shuttle?

34:38.250 --> 34:39.512
Hear that?

34:39.599 --> 34:40.687
Hear what?

34:45.170 --> 34:46.475
What is that?

34:48.042 --> 34:49.435
What are you doing?

34:56.703 --> 35:00.446
[dramatic music rises, subsides]

35:07.670 --> 35:09.411
[all yelling]

35:09.498 --> 35:10.760
Go!

35:14.416 --> 35:16.375
[Perez] Move out!

35:18.942 --> 35:20.335
[gunfire]

35:22.511 --> 35:24.383
[Marines shouting]

35:36.308 --> 35:38.092
[Keyes, over radio]
This is Admiral Keyes.

35:38.179 --> 35:39.398
Upper hangar is under attack

35:39.485 --> 35:41.661
from multiple
Covenant units, over.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.231
That transport's
full of civilians.

35:48.450 --> 35:50.365
We'll buy you some time.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.151
Cover on the way.

35:53.238 --> 35:54.239
Move it!

35:54.326 --> 35:55.631
- Move it!
- Move it!

35:56.937 --> 35:58.678
Fire team in the middle!

35:59.592 --> 36:01.420
[Marine] Come on, Marines!
You got this!

36:01.507 --> 36:03.378
[shouting voice cries out]

36:07.817 --> 36:09.167
[groans]

36:10.385 --> 36:11.908
I'll take that.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.562
[indistinct shouting]

36:22.919 --> 36:24.399
Civilians are all
on board, sir.

36:24.486 --> 36:25.487
Great.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.667
[beeping]

36:35.018 --> 36:36.716
Where are you going?

36:36.803 --> 36:38.065
I'll be back.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.415
Can you fly this thing?

36:40.502 --> 36:42.461
Not without you on it, sir.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.158
[Keyes] I'll be back!

36:49.946 --> 36:52.166

37:24.372 --> 37:26.940
[snarling]

37:27.027 --> 37:28.158
We have to help him.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.204
No. We can't.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.249
[Halsey] Wait!

37:35.775 --> 37:36.906
[Keyes, over comm]
Corporal Perez?

37:36.993 --> 37:38.299
Yes, sir?

37:39.866 --> 37:41.259
Punch it.

37:42.085 --> 37:43.522
I can't do that, sir.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.480
Yes.

37:47.569 --> 37:49.789
You can.

37:49.876 --> 37:50.920
[snarling]

37:51.007 --> 37:53.227
[Halsey]
No! Let me go!
