I was looking for the black box
just like I said,

11:35.654 --> 11:38.156
and the thing is,
I found it, okay?

11:38.240 --> 11:40.242
I found it.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.621
You wanna hear what was on it?
Is that of any interest to you?

11:45.747 --> 11:47.416
Jalal Haqqani did not
shoot down

11:47.499 --> 11:48.500
the president's helicopter.

11:48.584 --> 11:49.751
It was a mechanical failure.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.128
So if you care about lies,

11:51.211 --> 11:53.547
the U.S. is rushing to war
right now based on one.

11:54.882 --> 11:55.883
Where is it?

11:55.966 --> 11:57.134
What?

11:57.217 --> 11:59.344
What do you think?
The flight recorder.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.017
Yevgeny Gromov
stole it from me.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.101
(scoffs)

12:06.185 --> 12:08.187
I just need a few days
to get it back.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.148
I know you're testifying
against me at the tribunal,

12:11.231 --> 12:13.233
and if you need to tell them how
the safe house got discovered,

12:13.317 --> 12:14.359
that I lied to you, fine.

12:14.443 --> 12:15.485
I will even back you up.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.363
But please, just not yet.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.615
How you gonna find it?

12:21.575 --> 12:23.452
You say you need a few days.
You must have a plan.

12:23.535 --> 12:24.536
What is it?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.207
-(car horn beeps)
-That's my car.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.374
I can't tell you everything.

12:29.458 --> 12:30.876
That right there is how

12:30.959 --> 12:32.461
we got in trouble
the last time.

12:32.544 --> 12:34.546
(sighs) Okay.
O-okay.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.548
Yevgeny has the recorder,
like I said,

12:36.632 --> 12:38.467
but he is willing to trade.

12:40.761 --> 12:42.804
For what?

12:42.888 --> 12:44.890
For what?
What did we just say?

12:44.973 --> 12:46.808
You tell me everything
or I'm out of here.

12:49.353 --> 12:51.605
He is willing to trade
for the identity of an agent

12:51.688 --> 12:54.566
in the Russian government,
an asset of Saul's.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.527
So why didn't they ask Saul?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.362
Because he'd never agree.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.156
But you would.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.116
I already have.

13:08.664 --> 13:11.375
Saul was based in Berlin
from 1982 to 1987,

13:11.458 --> 13:12.751
before the wall came down.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.170
He must have recruited
the asset during that time.

13:17.172 --> 13:18.465
That's all you've got?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.009
Not quite.

13:21.093 --> 13:22.427
He told me once
about an exfiltration

13:22.511 --> 13:24.471
that went bad towards the end
of his stay there.

13:24.555 --> 13:26.849
Someone he'd recruited,
that's where I'd start.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.183
(scoffs)

13:28.267 --> 13:29.560
Where you'd start?

13:30.602 --> 13:32.396
No one's gonna let you anywhere
near a Langley computer.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.731
You know that, right?
No one will even talk to you.

13:34.815 --> 13:35.816
You are.

13:39.570 --> 13:41.530
Yeah, you're right.
I am.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.950
And I know how you might think
I'd help you

13:45.033 --> 13:46.243
given how you managed
to rope me

13:46.326 --> 13:48.078
into your bullshit
twice before,

13:48.161 --> 13:51.957
but no,
I can't help you at all.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.128
What I can do is let everyone
know what you're up to,

13:56.211 --> 13:57.254
beginning with Saul.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.247
Yeah, and you.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.957
Me?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.585
She ambushed me
at Walter Reed this morning,

15:59.668 --> 16:01.003
Carrie did.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.547
She was waiting
as I was being discharged,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.716
and she said a lot
of crazy stuff.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.259
Like?

16:07.342 --> 16:10.470
Like there's this black box
she found that proves

16:10.554 --> 16:12.389
Jalal didn't shoot down
the helicopter--

16:12.472 --> 16:15.517
it was a mechanical failure--
but Yevgeny stole it from her.

16:15.601 --> 16:16.894
And if she could
just get it back,

16:16.977 --> 16:18.395
she could save the world.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.022
That's true, all of it.

16:21.356 --> 16:25.694
Look, I know you're going
in front of the tribunal today.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.572
I agreed to talk you
because I thought

16:28.655 --> 16:31.116
maybe you were looking for
a way to be on Carrie's side.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.453
(scoffs)
Not really.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.872
SAUL: I'm not exactly sure
what she did do or didn't do

16:36.955 --> 16:38.790
or what mistakes she made.

16:38.874 --> 16:41.084
There's always some.

16:41.168 --> 16:44.463
But everything she does,
everything...

16:44.546 --> 16:47.299
is because she never loses
sight of what's important.

16:48.759 --> 16:51.970
And honestly, she's the only
person I've ever known

16:52.054 --> 16:54.389
I can say that of.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.393
So we're all here fiddling
while Rome burns.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.939

to help them

17:02.022 --> 17:04.191

you have to do what she does.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.325
You have to decide for yourself
what matters.

23:21.568 --> 23:24.071
A guy named Andrei Kuznetsov.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.325
Saul recruited him
at a KGB language school

23:28.408 --> 23:29.993
in East Berlin.

23:30.077 --> 23:31.954
For some reason,
the guy panicked,

23:32.037 --> 23:34.039
and Saul had to get him out
in a hurry.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.125
The extraction got messy.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.586
He actually lost a leg.

23:40.879 --> 23:42.381
But he's still alive.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.550
He is?

23:44.633 --> 23:46.802
And living
under witness protection

23:46.885 --> 23:50.305
in Pennsylvania as Alex Surnow.

23:51.765 --> 23:54.101
So he's-he's not the asset.

23:54.184 --> 23:56.061
No, he can't be.

23:56.144 --> 23:58.021
He's been stateside
for 30 years.

23:59.857 --> 24:01.567
But I think
he might know something.

24:03.277 --> 24:04.278
Why?

24:05.821 --> 24:09.449
Saul never declared an asset
out of the East again, ever.

24:09.533 --> 24:10.784
But right around this time

24:10.868 --> 24:13.787
is when all his
intelligence coups begin,

24:13.871 --> 24:17.207
like that Gorbachev was willing
to do business with the West,

24:17.291 --> 24:19.418
like the cover-up at Chernobyl,

24:19.501 --> 24:21.170
like Aldrich Ames.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.965
(exhales deeply)

24:26.884 --> 24:28.135
Thank you.

24:43.942 --> 24:45.319
You sure you wanna do this?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.113
Betray Saul.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.116
I'm sure I don't want to.

24:52.326 --> 24:54.203
Tell me there's another way.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.621
Hm.

24:56.997 --> 24:59.416
You're right,
there's probably not.

25:03.003 --> 25:04.546
Anyway, I'm done.

25:06.381 --> 25:07.591
What do you mean you're done?

25:07.674 --> 25:10.010
I mean, I'm done,
not just with this,

25:10.093 --> 25:12.012
with everything,
the whole CIA.

25:12.095 --> 25:15.307
Wh-that-that's what
this means to you?

25:15.390 --> 25:16.808
After what you found here,

25:16.892 --> 25:18.602
after you thought your way
through it,

25:18.685 --> 25:20.229
you think that's a reason
to quit?

25:20.312 --> 25:22.814
No, but the Special Ops
team dying,

25:22.898 --> 25:24.107
that's a reason.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.861
And this asset will be tortured
to death if you find him.

25:27.945 --> 25:28.946
That's a reason.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.365
It'll get us
the flight recorder.

25:33.075 --> 25:34.701
That's how you see it.
I know.

25:34.785 --> 25:38.956
And I've tried to see it
like you, but I just can't.

25:44.461 --> 25:48.382
I got into this thinking
I would make things better.

25:50.175 --> 25:52.427
But I don't actually
believe that anymore.
