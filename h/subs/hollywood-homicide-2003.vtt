14:15.229 --> 14:16.688
We've been partners for what,
four months?

14:16.856 --> 14:19.899

That's all I'm saying.

All right.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.581
Let me paint you
a picture.

14:34.748 --> 14:39.419
Portrait of Joe Gavilan.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.963
Seven, eight years ago,
I sold off the results

14:42.131 --> 14:46.009
of my entrepreneurial efforts
up to that point.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.011
Three tanning salons

14:48.178 --> 14:50.889
and two original
silk-tip nail parlors

14:51.056 --> 14:55.268
in the Antelope Valley,
and I started attending

14:55.436 --> 14:57.562
weekend real estate
seminars

14:57.730 --> 14:59.397
at the Airport Hyatt.

14:59.565 --> 15:02.817
You know, "How to Make
$1 Million in Real Estate

15:02.985 --> 15:04.694
with Very Little Money Down."

15:04.862 --> 15:06.321
Sounds good.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.031
Started out with
a condo in Sherman Oaks.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.490
Slapped some paint
on the walls.

15:09.658 --> 15:10.992
Refaced
the kitchen cabinets.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.119
Traded up to
a smoke-damaged ranch

15:13.287 --> 15:17.707
in Tarzana,
then a Spanish on Outpost

15:17.875 --> 15:21.920
and a fake Mediterranean
in Los Feliz.

15:22.087 --> 15:26.341
Pretty soon, I had everything
I've got tied up in this...

15:26.508 --> 15:30.261
this monstrosity...
on Mt. Olympus,

15:30.429 --> 15:34.641
at the corner of Hercules and,
I shit you not, Achilles.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.184
So what's the problem?

15:36.352 --> 15:38.603
The problem is if I don't
score a big commission

15:38.771 --> 15:44.609
or get rid of this...
piece of shit on Mt. Olympics...

15:44.777 --> 15:47.820
Well, the word Titanic
comes to mind.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.156

who works

15:50.324 --> 15:51.824

15:51.992 --> 15:54.160
Says that he might be
selling his place.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.954
Maybe you can
get the listing.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.413
Got a name?

15:57.581 --> 15:58.873
Well, her name's, like,
Mimi or Moma

15:59.041 --> 16:01.501

I don't remember.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.672
Not the girl, hot rocks.
The producer.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.717

Way before my time. I...
