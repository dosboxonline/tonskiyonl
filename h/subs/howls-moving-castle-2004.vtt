HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE

01:40.713 --> 01:41.505
Miss Sophie,

01:42.423 --> 01:44.050
I've closed up the shop.

01:44.258 --> 01:46.677
You should come too, Sophie.

01:46.886 --> 01:49.847
I'll just finish this.
Go have some fun.

01:50.139 --> 01:51.932
All right, then, I'm off.

01:52.892 --> 01:54.226
I'm going.

01:55.269 --> 01:57.313
Look, it's Howl's castle.

01:57.521 --> 01:58.898
What? Howl? Where, where?

01:59.106 --> 02:00.941
Look how close it is.

02:01.609 --> 02:03.027
Oh, no!

02:03.235 --> 02:05.154
I wonder if Howl's in town.

02:13.537 --> 02:14.246
It took off.

02:14.455 --> 02:17.166
No, just hiding
from all the soldiers.

02:17.375 --> 02:20.002
Say, did you hear?
Remember Martha, from South Haven?

02:20.211 --> 02:22.296
They say Howl tore her heart out.

02:22.505 --> 02:23.214
How scary...

02:23.422 --> 02:26.217
Don't worry, he's not going
to want yours.

02:27.802 --> 02:28.886
Hurry up.

02:30.429 --> 02:32.264
Really?

02:32.765 --> 02:34.934
Oh, cut it out...

04:35.387 --> 04:37.932
Hey there little mouse,
lost your way?

04:38.432 --> 04:40.100
Oh, no... I'm fine.

04:40.768 --> 04:43.979
Then how about a cup of tea?
Care to join me?

04:44.563 --> 04:48.567
- No thank you, I'm busy
- She sure is a cute little mouse.

04:48.776 --> 04:50.861
Say, how old are you?
You live around here?

04:51.654 --> 04:52.738
Let me pass!

04:53.364 --> 04:56.241
See, it's those whiskers of yours.

04:56.450 --> 04:58.702
She's even cuter when she's mad.

04:58.911 --> 05:00.245
Hey, there, I'm sorry.

05:01.538 --> 05:02.623
Where've you been?

05:03.290 --> 05:05.668
- Who are you?
- I'm with her.

05:05.876 --> 05:08.629
Why don't you two take
a little walk?

05:16.136 --> 05:17.471
Don't hold it against them.

05:18.263 --> 05:19.890
They're harmless.

05:20.099 --> 05:23.185
Where to? I'll be your escort.

05:23.602 --> 05:25.813
No, really,
I'm only going to Cesari's.

05:26.438 --> 05:28.524
Act normal.
I'm being followed.

05:28.732 --> 05:29.900
Just walk.

05:50.838 --> 05:53.048
Sorry, I got you involved.

05:57.302 --> 05:57.886
This way.

06:05.936 --> 06:06.478
Hold on.

06:12.693 --> 06:14.987
Drop your legs, keep walking.

06:20.159 --> 06:22.786
That's right, don't be frightened.

06:38.510 --> 06:39.761
Very nice.

06:54.693 --> 06:56.486
I'll draw them off.

06:56.695 --> 06:58.322
Wait here until the coast is clear.

06:59.031 --> 06:59.990
Yes.

07:00.866 --> 07:02.159
That's my girl.

07:15.005 --> 07:17.716
- Any chocolate Letties?
- Look this way, Lettie.

07:17.925 --> 07:19.927
- Hey, make room.
- Let's go for a walk, Lettie.

07:20.135 --> 07:20.969
My sister?

07:22.554 --> 07:24.431
Come back soon, Lettie.

07:28.393 --> 07:29.311
Sophie?

07:30.896 --> 07:34.358
How did you land
on the veranda like that?

07:35.108 --> 07:37.569
Have you become an angel?
It feels like I'm in a dream...

07:37.778 --> 07:39.905
Lettie, why not use the office?

07:40.113 --> 07:43.450
Thanks, but I should really
be working.

07:44.785 --> 07:48.205
What?
You sure he wasn't a wizard?

07:48.580 --> 07:50.207
He was so kind...

07:51.249 --> 07:53.293
He rescued me...

07:53.502 --> 07:56.088
Don't tell me he's stolen your heart.

07:56.922 --> 08:00.801
If that was the wizard Howl,
he'd have eaten it right up.

08:01.593 --> 08:04.805
Don't worry,
Howl's only after beauties.

08:05.305 --> 08:06.682
There you go again.

08:06.890 --> 08:10.060
Listen to me,
we live in dangerous times.

08:10.268 --> 08:13.063
They say even the Witch of the Waste.
Is back on the prowl.

08:14.606 --> 08:16.191
Sophie?

08:17.609 --> 08:18.860
Oh, you...

08:21.571 --> 08:23.532
Lettie, the Madeleines are done.

08:24.282 --> 08:25.867
Okay, be right there.

08:26.076 --> 08:27.285
All right.

08:29.162 --> 08:30.706
I'm going home.

08:30.914 --> 08:32.957
It's a relief to know
you're doing well.

08:35.168 --> 08:36.044
Hello, Lettie.

08:36.253 --> 08:37.294
Nice to see you.

08:37.796 --> 08:41.258
Listen, are you going to spend
your whole life in that shop?

08:42.801 --> 08:44.970
It meant so much to Papa.

08:45.178 --> 08:46.388
Besides, I'm the eldest.

08:46.596 --> 08:48.974
That's not what I meant.

08:49.182 --> 08:50.600
Are you sure
you want to be a hatter?

08:51.143 --> 08:52.060
Well, I...

08:52.269 --> 08:54.938
- Bye, Lettie!
- Come by the shop next time.

08:55.147 --> 08:55.939
Sure.

08:56.148 --> 08:57.107
I'll be on my way.

08:57.315 --> 09:00.986
Sophie, you've got to
look out for yourself.

10:09.179 --> 10:11.306
Sorry, the shop's closed.

10:11.514 --> 10:13.892
I thought I'd locked the door.

10:16.228 --> 10:18.605
What a cheap shop,

10:18.813 --> 10:20.899
full of cheap little hats.

10:22.150 --> 10:25.028
And you're
quite cheap-looking yourself.

10:26.571 --> 10:29.032
This is just a simple hat shop.

10:35.413 --> 10:37.249
I think you had better leave.

10:38.416 --> 10:41.753
You're very brave, taking on
the Witch of the Waste.

10:42.420 --> 10:43.964
The Witch of the Waste?

10:51.680 --> 10:54.933
You won't be able to tell anyone
about that spell.

10:55.141 --> 10:57.394
My regards to Howl.

11:43.940 --> 11:45.817
Is this really me!

11:46.025 --> 11:48.194
I've got to stay calm.

12:04.878 --> 12:06.379
I've got to calm down.

12:06.588 --> 12:09.466
It's no use panicking, Sophie.

12:11.259 --> 12:13.636
I'll be fine, I'll be fine.

12:15.388 --> 12:19.517
I've got to calm down.

12:31.196 --> 12:32.322
I'm back!

12:32.530 --> 12:34.324
Welcome home, Ma'am!

12:34.532 --> 12:37.535
How do you like it?
It's all the rage in Kingsbury.

12:37.744 --> 12:39.829
- Amazing!
- It suits you.

12:40.205 --> 12:43.208
Don't you think it's wonderful?
Sophie!

12:44.959 --> 12:46.920
Mrs. Hatter, Sophie hasn't come down
to work yet

12:48.254 --> 12:50.006
I wonder what's the matter?

12:52.509 --> 12:54.093
Sophie!

13:01.059 --> 13:02.685
Don't come in!

13:02.894 --> 13:05.104
I've got an awful cold!

13:05.313 --> 13:06.856
I don't want you to catch it.

13:07.815 --> 13:09.651
You sound just awful...

13:09.859 --> 13:11.736
Like some 90 year-old woman.

13:11.945 --> 13:14.614
I'll stay in bed today.

13:14.822 --> 13:17.367
You sure? All right, then.

13:19.327 --> 13:21.704
Here we go...

13:32.924 --> 13:34.676
You'll be fine, old lady.

13:34.884 --> 13:38.972
You're still healthy,
and these clothes finally suit you.

13:41.516 --> 13:43.726
But I can't stay here.

13:54.445 --> 13:55.905
Ouch, ouch!

13:56.406 --> 13:58.658
It's not easy being old.

14:08.293 --> 14:11.421
They're saying this war
is going to be terrible...

14:23.349 --> 14:25.393
Like a hand, granny?

14:25.810 --> 14:29.355
Such a gentleman,
but I'll manage.

14:30.481 --> 14:33.151
Sure, old lady,
but where are you off to?

14:33.359 --> 14:35.778
Just a bit farther
than where you're going.

14:40.658 --> 14:42.577
I don't recommend it, granny.

14:42.785 --> 14:45.329
Nothing but witches and wizards ahead.

14:45.538 --> 14:47.290
Thank you.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.293
Going to the Folding Valley,
at this hour?

14:50.501 --> 14:52.795
Says her youngest sister's there.

15:07.310 --> 15:09.937
I've hardly made any progress at all.

15:11.898 --> 15:15.109
Thank goodness
I've still got my teeth.

15:22.533 --> 15:24.494
That'll make a good cane.

15:24.744 --> 15:26.621
Up we go.

15:32.919 --> 15:35.171
Might be a bit too thick.

15:43.888 --> 15:45.348
Ouch, ouch!

15:46.390 --> 15:47.642
What a stubborn branch.

15:50.311 --> 15:52.563
Never underestimate
Grandma Sophie.

15:53.147 --> 15:54.398
Heave!

16:05.326 --> 16:06.577
A scarecrow, eh?

16:06.786 --> 16:09.455
I thought you were
working for the Witch.

16:09.872 --> 16:12.667
But how do you stand by yourself?

16:15.419 --> 16:17.380
Your head's a turnip.

16:17.838 --> 16:21.133
I've always hated turnips.

16:21.425 --> 16:23.844
At least you're not
upside down anymore.

16:24.095 --> 16:25.680
So long.

16:32.937 --> 16:34.647
It's so cold.

16:35.356 --> 16:37.358
The town's still so close.

16:43.072 --> 16:44.323
Don't follow me!

16:44.532 --> 16:47.493
You don't owe me a thing.

16:47.952 --> 16:49.912
You must be
a magical whatever-you-are.

16:50.121 --> 16:52.915
I've had enough of witches and spells!

16:53.499 --> 16:56.294
Just go stand wherever you like!

17:17.481 --> 17:20.776
This is a perfect cane
Thank you kindly

17:20.984 --> 17:25.114
While you're at it, could you bring me
a house to sleep in?

17:36.334 --> 17:38.961
Seems you get more cunning with age.

17:50.014 --> 17:51.807
What a huge battleship.

17:54.602 --> 17:58.564
I never realized how weak you feel
when you get old.

18:15.122 --> 18:16.499
I smell smoke.

18:16.874 --> 18:19.335
Maybe there's a cabin.

18:39.063 --> 18:41.649
Turnip-head, isn't that Howl's Castle?

18:42.233 --> 18:45.820
This is hardly what I meant
when I asked for shelter!

18:56.872 --> 18:58.332
What is this?

18:58.541 --> 18:59.834
You call this a castle?

19:20.187 --> 19:22.147
Is that the way in?

19:24.191 --> 19:26.068
Just wait up there!

19:28.654 --> 19:29.905
Hey, there!

19:31.198 --> 19:33.909
Are you going to let me on, or not!

19:38.539 --> 19:40.374
My shawl!

19:53.387 --> 19:57.016
It seems warm enough inside, Turnip.
I'm going in.

19:57.224 --> 19:58.309
Thank you.

19:58.517 --> 20:02.313
Even Howl wouldn't want
an ancient heart like mine.

20:05.232 --> 20:06.859
This time, it's really goodbye.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.903
You may be a turnip,
but you're a good turnip

20:10.112 --> 20:11.989
May you find happiness.

20:59.078 --> 21:00.662
What is this place?

21:00.871 --> 21:03.373
Just looks like a dilapidated heap.

21:12.174 --> 21:16.637
Well, one nice thing about getting old
is that nothing surprises you anymore

21:26.355 --> 21:28.565
That's some spell you're under.

21:29.608 --> 21:32.569
It won't be easy to break.

21:34.238 --> 21:35.572
The fire talked!

21:35.781 --> 21:38.075
And you can't even
tell anyone about it.

21:38.575 --> 21:40.119
You're Howl?

21:40.327 --> 21:44.748
Wrong. I'm the fire demon, Calcifer!

21:45.332 --> 21:49.461
Well, then, Calcifer, can you break
the spell I'm under?

21:50.295 --> 21:51.255
Easy

21:51.463 --> 21:53.882
If you break the spell that chains me
to this place,

21:54.091 --> 21:56.510
I'll break your spell in a flash.

21:57.469 --> 22:00.097
In other words, bargain with a demon.

22:00.389 --> 22:02.683
You sure you can keep that promise?

22:03.100 --> 22:05.352
Demons don't make promises.

22:06.895 --> 22:08.355
I suggest you look elsewhere.

22:08.730 --> 22:10.816
But I'm an exploited demon!

22:11.024 --> 22:14.361
I'm chained here by a contract
with Howl, who works me to death.

22:14.653 --> 22:17.614
I'm the one who keeps
this castle moving.

22:17.823 --> 22:21.285
My, you've got it rough.

22:21.827 --> 22:25.831
If you figure out the secret contract,
the spell will break.

22:26.039 --> 22:28.834
If you do that,
I'll break your spell, too.

22:29.585 --> 22:33.380
All right.
A bargain, eh?

22:38.760 --> 22:39.970
Granny!

22:40.178 --> 22:41.555
Granny!

22:46.268 --> 22:48.228
Boy...
I've got my doubts about her.

23:42.616 --> 23:44.159
Hey, who's this?

23:44.368 --> 23:45.952
Porthaven!

23:46.161 --> 23:48.163
When did she get in?

23:55.087 --> 23:56.713
Stand by!

24:01.093 --> 24:02.677
Why, Mayor, sir!

24:02.886 --> 24:06.681
The sun is already high.
Is Master Jenkins at home?

24:07.182 --> 24:08.975
The Master is out.

24:09.184 --> 24:11.686
I answer in his stead.

24:12.479 --> 24:15.148
An invitation from His Majesty.

24:15.357 --> 24:16.525
It has come to war.

24:16.983 --> 24:19.444
His Majesty desires every wizard

24:19.653 --> 24:22.489
and magician, even the witches,
to aid our homeland.

24:22.697 --> 24:25.951
His presence is imperative.
That is all.

24:28.578 --> 24:30.163
War, how awful.

24:31.164 --> 24:33.041
And who might you be?

24:33.792 --> 24:35.418
Calcifer let me in.

24:35.627 --> 24:38.755
Don't look at me.
She wandered in from the Wastes.

24:39.297 --> 24:40.382
The Wastes?

24:40.590 --> 24:43.677
That's strange.
You're not a witch, are you?

24:44.594 --> 24:46.680
A witch could never get in.

24:47.305 --> 24:48.974
Porthaven, again!

24:50.058 --> 24:51.393
A customer?

24:53.353 --> 24:54.938
Stand by.

24:57.816 --> 24:59.317
State your purpose.

24:59.526 --> 25:01.069
Mama sent me.

25:01.653 --> 25:04.197
The usual spell?

25:05.657 --> 25:07.784
Behave yourself, now.

25:24.801 --> 25:26.136
It's not the Wastes.

25:26.344 --> 25:29.139
Granny, are you a witch, too?

25:29.764 --> 25:33.894
That's right,
I'm the scariest witch in the land.

25:34.144 --> 25:36.980
Sprinkle this powder on your ship
and the winds will favor it.

25:37.188 --> 25:38.273
Sure.

25:40.650 --> 25:42.193
Many thanks.

25:44.237 --> 25:46.489
I can't have you making up things.

25:46.698 --> 25:48.366
You should give up that disguise.

25:48.575 --> 25:51.536
It's not a disguise, it's magic.

25:53.371 --> 25:55.040
The Kingsbury door.

25:56.875 --> 25:57.667
Stand by.

26:03.381 --> 26:06.051
Is this the residence of
Wizard Pendragon?

26:06.259 --> 26:07.260
It is, indeed.

26:07.469 --> 26:10.597
I bear an invitation
from His Majesty.

26:10.889 --> 26:15.018
Please inform Master Pendragon
that he is required at the Palace.

26:15.977 --> 26:18.063
Our thanks to you.

26:32.744 --> 26:35.288
A city fit for a king

26:35.497 --> 26:38.166
Get back in or you'll lose your nose.

26:43.296 --> 26:45.548
Stop wandering around!

27:21.626 --> 27:24.712
That's enough!
I'm going to get really mad.

27:25.713 --> 27:27.757
This is a magic house, isn't it?

27:27.966 --> 27:28.758
Oh, boy!

27:28.967 --> 27:32.387
- Where does the black one lead?
- Only Master Howl knows.

27:33.179 --> 27:35.473
I'm having my breakfast.

27:44.816 --> 27:47.026
But you've got bacon and eggs.

27:48.027 --> 27:51.197
We can't use the fire
when Master Howl's away.

27:54.784 --> 27:56.619
I'll cook for you.

27:57.162 --> 27:58.163
But you can't.

27:58.371 --> 28:01.583
Calcifer only obeys Master Howl.

28:01.833 --> 28:04.377
That's right, I won't cook for you.

28:04.586 --> 28:07.463
Oh, here's my hat.

28:10.675 --> 28:13.428
All right, Calcifer.
Be a good fire, now.

28:13.845 --> 28:16.097
Forget it, I'm a demon!

28:16.306 --> 28:18.766
I answer to no one.

28:19.350 --> 28:22.395
You'll do as I say,
or I'll pour water on you.

28:22.604 --> 28:25.398
Or would you rather I told Howl
about our bargain?

28:26.858 --> 28:30.737
Hey! Hey! I never should've let
this old lady in.

28:30.945 --> 28:32.822
So, what'll it be?

28:36.242 --> 28:39.329
That's right, there's a good fire.

28:41.623 --> 28:44.125
Hey! Hey!
I'll burn the bacon.

28:44.667 --> 28:46.711
Calcifer's doing what she says.

28:46.920 --> 28:49.589
I'd like some tea, too.
Have you got a kettle?

28:49.797 --> 28:50.882
Sure!

29:00.183 --> 29:02.185
Welcome home, Master Howl.

29:02.393 --> 29:04.395
You have letters from the king.

29:04.604 --> 29:07.190
To Jenkins and to Pendragon.

29:17.909 --> 29:20.787
Calcifer, you're so obedient.

29:21.287 --> 29:22.789
She bullied me.

29:23.748 --> 29:26.167
Not an easy thing to do.

29:26.709 --> 29:28.044
Who exactly are you?

29:28.586 --> 29:31.214
I'm Grandma Sophie.

29:31.422 --> 29:34.050
You see, I'm your
new cleaning lady.

29:34.676 --> 29:35.718
Give me that.

29:39.806 --> 29:42.850
Pass me two more bacon slices
and six more eggs.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.758
And who hired you to clean?

30:16.592 --> 30:18.219
Why, I hired myself.

30:18.428 --> 30:20.680
I've never seen such a filthy house.

30:22.765 --> 30:24.559
Markl, plates.

30:28.146 --> 30:30.523
You're all ganging up on me!

30:30.815 --> 30:32.400
Please join us, Sophie.

30:37.947 --> 30:39.532
Sit over here.

30:54.380 --> 30:55.256
Pick one.

30:55.882 --> 30:57.758
Everything else is dirty.

31:00.845 --> 31:02.763
I've got my work cut out for me.

31:05.266 --> 31:06.100
Markl.

31:06.309 --> 31:07.268
Yes.

31:08.895 --> 31:09.979
Sophie.

31:10.188 --> 31:11.397
Thank you.

31:13.024 --> 31:15.484
Brethren, let us partake
of our daily bread.

31:15.693 --> 31:19.155
Our daily bread. Haven't had
a real breakfast in a long while.

31:26.037 --> 31:28.915
So many manners to teach...

31:30.041 --> 31:32.752
So, what's that in your pocket?

31:44.513 --> 31:45.514
I wonder what it is.

31:45.723 --> 31:46.974
Let me.

31:53.064 --> 31:55.816
It's scorched into the table!
Master Howl, this is...

31:56.901 --> 31:58.402
Ancient sorcery.

31:58.611 --> 31:59.820
And powerful, too.

32:00.363 --> 32:01.656
The Witch of the Waste?

32:02.823 --> 32:06.494
"He who catches a falling star,
oh heartless man.

32:06.702 --> 32:08.913
Your heart shall be mine."

32:09.121 --> 32:10.414
Well, so much for the tab. Le

32:24.470 --> 32:26.138
Wow, it's gone!

32:26.347 --> 32:28.683
The scorch mark has vanished,
but not the spell.

32:29.392 --> 32:31.978
Brethren, continue your meal.

32:33.270 --> 32:36.273
Calcifer, move the castle
100 kilometers.

32:41.821 --> 32:44.907
- And send hot water to the bath.
- Not that, too!

32:47.493 --> 32:49.870
Do you work
for the Witch of the Waste?

32:51.205 --> 32:55.251
Don't be stupid! The witch...

32:58.713 --> 33:01.590
Actually...
the witch... I...

33:06.762 --> 33:09.765
Damn that Witch of the Waste!
Wait 'til I get my hands on her!

33:09.974 --> 33:11.976
Let me finish eating this.

33:16.147 --> 33:19.567
Bugs, you'd better scurry away
or I'll sweep you out!

33:22.069 --> 33:24.113
Every last one of you,
mocking me!

33:31.245 --> 33:33.122
There's a spell I need.

33:33.330 --> 33:34.290
Later.

33:34.498 --> 33:36.542
A witch rages within.

33:43.299 --> 33:44.633
Sophie!

33:46.677 --> 33:49.680
Sophie! I'm going out.

33:50.681 --> 33:52.933
I'll die without some fresh wood!

33:53.517 --> 33:55.394
What, what are you doing?

33:55.769 --> 33:58.981
I'll fall, I'll fall!
I'm in peril!

33:59.690 --> 34:01.317
I'm sweeping the ashes.

34:01.525 --> 34:02.401
Won't be a minute.

34:02.610 --> 34:04.487
I'm in danger!

34:04.695 --> 34:06.238
I'm in danger...

34:07.656 --> 34:08.824
I'll go out!

34:09.158 --> 34:10.409
Oh, no!

34:13.496 --> 34:16.331
I'm slipping...

34:22.670 --> 34:24.632
Hurry, Sophie!

34:46.987 --> 34:49.907
Try not to torment my friend.

34:55.161 --> 34:57.456
Master Howl, are you going out?

34:59.917 --> 35:02.628
Markl, tell our cleaning lady
not to get

35:02.836 --> 35:04.338
too carried away.

35:09.301 --> 35:11.011
What'd you do, Sophie?

35:12.054 --> 35:13.514
She abused me!

35:14.139 --> 35:16.892
If I die, Howl goes with me.

35:17.101 --> 35:18.519
I'm the cleaning lady.

35:18.727 --> 35:20.896
It's my job to clean.

35:22.356 --> 35:24.817
No, not the 2nd floor!

35:25.442 --> 35:28.320
If I were you, I'd put your
precious things away in a hurry.

35:29.613 --> 35:31.407
Save my room for later.

35:34.618 --> 35:37.705
My little outburst
gave me back my strength.

35:41.417 --> 35:43.669
What a strange house!

36:20.330 --> 36:21.790
Amazing!

36:21.999 --> 36:24.084
Calcifer, Calcifer!

36:24.293 --> 36:26.378
Are you moving the castle?

36:26.587 --> 36:29.089
What a lot of fuss! Of course I am.

36:29.298 --> 36:30.591
You're incredible, Calcifer!

36:31.175 --> 36:34.219
Your magic's first class.
I misjudged you completely!

36:36.889 --> 36:38.348
You think so?

36:38.557 --> 36:40.476
You really think so!

36:46.982 --> 36:49.151
Oh, no, not yet!

37:21.391 --> 37:22.684
How beautiful.

37:22.893 --> 37:24.978
It's called Star Lake.

37:30.067 --> 37:31.860
Something's stuck in there.

37:32.069 --> 37:34.404
Oh, dear.
Lend me a hand, Markl.

37:34.613 --> 37:35.656
Sure.

37:41.828 --> 37:42.955
And up!

37:43.163 --> 37:44.623
A scarecrow!

37:44.831 --> 37:46.667
He's called Turnip, the Turnip-head.

37:46.875 --> 37:49.670
You sure like being upside down.

37:58.762 --> 38:01.056
The odd creature seems to have
taken a liking to me.

38:01.265 --> 38:03.058
He followed me here.

38:03.267 --> 38:05.477
Are you sure
you're not a witch, Sophie?

38:05.686 --> 38:09.147
That's right, I'm the cleanest witch
in the land.

38:38.510 --> 38:41.263
Turnip, don't pull it so tight.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.983
Seems like he likes doing the wash.

38:53.191 --> 38:55.444
They'll dry in no time.

38:57.946 --> 39:00.240
Turnip must belong to the demons.

39:00.449 --> 39:01.992
Calcifer doesn't seem to mind him.

39:02.200 --> 39:05.120
You're right,
maybe he's a demon of the dead.

39:06.371 --> 39:09.916
But he led me
to this wonderful place.

39:52.292 --> 39:55.045
I've put away all the laundry, Sophie.

39:55.295 --> 39:58.673
Why, thank you.
We'd better be getting back.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.801
How mysterious,

40:01.009 --> 40:04.179
I've never felt such peace.

41:23.008 --> 41:24.134
Stinks!

41:24.384 --> 41:26.970
You reek of burnt flesh and steel.

41:46.781 --> 41:49.743
Keep flying and one day you
won't be able to change yourself back.

41:54.372 --> 41:56.833
Isn't it great!
Sophie did this for me.

42:00.170 --> 42:01.880
The fighting is fierce.

42:02.088 --> 42:05.633
The country's ablaze, from the
southern coast to the northern border.

42:06.259 --> 42:08.386
I hate the fire in gunpowder.

42:08.595 --> 42:11.222
They have no manners

42:12.515 --> 42:15.435
- My own kind attacked me.
- The Witch of the Waste?

42:15.643 --> 42:18.980
Hack wizards masquerading
as monsters.

42:19.689 --> 42:22.567
They'll cry plenty later on,

42:22.776 --> 42:24.819
when they can't regain human form.

42:25.445 --> 42:28.448
No, they'll just forget
they ever knew how to cry.

42:28.656 --> 42:31.242
Aren't you supposed to report
to the king yourself?

42:31.451 --> 42:32.702
Yes, well...

42:32.911 --> 42:34.329
Hot water for my bath

42:34.537 --> 42:36.331
Oh, no, not again.

43:09.405 --> 43:10.615
Is that Howl?

43:10.824 --> 43:12.951
Yeah, wasting my hot water again.

43:18.665 --> 43:21.209
I'm sure Howl won't eat any breakfast.

43:21.417 --> 43:22.293
No matter.

43:22.502 --> 43:24.045
Morning.

43:27.173 --> 43:29.133
It's lovely shopping in the morning.

43:29.342 --> 43:31.094
I've never seen the ocean!

43:32.011 --> 43:33.805
Such beautiful, sparkling water!

43:34.013 --> 43:35.932
Same as it always is.

43:45.358 --> 43:47.110
I myself hate potatoes.

43:47.318 --> 43:48.486
Pay up.

43:48.695 --> 43:49.988
Thank you.

43:50.321 --> 43:51.114
Thanks.

43:53.074 --> 43:55.493
Fish, all fresh off the boat.

43:55.910 --> 43:59.414
- That one's tasty.
- I myself hate fish.

43:59.706 --> 44:01.791
The fleet's come home!

44:02.000 --> 44:04.794
- Is that the smoke?
- There's been another battle.

44:05.044 --> 44:06.921
Really? Sorry, lady, later.

44:07.130 --> 44:08.673
That ship's on fire!

44:32.071 --> 44:33.948
Sophie, let's go get a closer look.

44:34.157 --> 44:37.243
No, I've no stomach for such things.
Let's go home.

44:38.077 --> 44:40.538
Our most advanced battleship,
reduced to this.

44:45.376 --> 44:47.462
Markl, there are Blob Men nearby.

44:47.754 --> 44:49.213
Don't move.

44:49.464 --> 44:51.549
They work for the Witch of the Waste.

44:57.555 --> 44:58.598
They're gone.

44:58.806 --> 45:01.017
Don't people notice
those terrible monsters?

45:06.939 --> 45:08.649
Look! Up there!

45:08.983 --> 45:10.735
That's what dropped those bombs!

45:10.943 --> 45:12.695
An enemy airship, Sophie!

45:18.659 --> 45:20.495
Sophie, flyers!

45:20.953 --> 45:23.831
Ignore the flyers!
They're enemy propaganda!

45:28.795 --> 45:30.046
Are you OK, Sophie?

45:36.677 --> 45:38.346
A glass of water, please

45:38.554 --> 45:39.555
Sure.

45:55.530 --> 45:58.199
Sophie, what did you do
to the bathroom shelves? Look!

45:59.450 --> 46:01.285
My hair's turned this weird color!

46:01.494 --> 46:03.204
What... what beautiful hair.

46:03.412 --> 46:04.413
Take a good look!

46:04.997 --> 46:08.042
You mixed up everything on
the shelves and ruined the spells!

46:09.418 --> 46:11.796
I didn't mix up anything,
I simply cleaned up.

46:12.296 --> 46:13.798
Cleaning, always cleaning.

46:14.006 --> 46:17.510
I told you not to get
too carried away!

46:17.760 --> 46:19.011
It's hopeless!

46:20.138 --> 46:22.682
How humiliating.

46:24.517 --> 46:25.935
It's not so very bad.

46:34.193 --> 46:36.737
This new shade's quite lovely
in its way.

46:37.446 --> 46:38.364
I'm done for.

46:38.573 --> 46:41.742
What's the point in living,
if you aren't beautiful?

46:53.588 --> 46:56.132
Stop, Howl! Cut it out!

46:56.716 --> 46:58.551
He's calling on
the spirits of Darkness.

46:58.759 --> 47:01.679
He did this last time
a girl ditched him.

47:05.057 --> 47:07.101
Please, Howl, that's enough.

47:07.894 --> 47:11.022
You can just dye your hair again.

47:21.449 --> 47:23.993
I've had enough of you, Howl!

47:24.201 --> 47:27.038
I've never once been beautiful!

47:28.914 --> 47:30.625
I've had enough of this place!

48:10.331 --> 48:13.834
Thank you, Turnip
You're a kind scarecrow

48:14.043 --> 48:16.754
Please come back, Sophie.
Howl's in trouble!

48:17.338 --> 48:20.341
Cut it out, Howl!
I'm going out!

48:21.300 --> 48:22.760
Sophie!

48:23.969 --> 48:25.221
Get over here!

48:27.598 --> 48:28.724
My, he's dramatic.

48:28.933 --> 48:30.017
Is he dead?

48:30.226 --> 48:33.229
Don't worry.
A tantrum never killed anyone.

48:33.437 --> 48:35.064
Help me, Markl.

48:39.443 --> 48:41.570
Get that hot water running, Markl!

48:42.029 --> 48:44.698
C'mon, you can still walk.

48:56.168 --> 48:58.045
You look after him now, Markl.

48:58.254 --> 48:59.296
Sure.

49:00.881 --> 49:02.800
I'll have to clean all over again.

49:26.115 --> 49:27.658
I'm coming in.

49:35.833 --> 49:38.627
Here's some hot milk.
Drink up.

49:41.881 --> 49:45.593
I'll leave it here.
Drink it while it's hot.

49:49.346 --> 49:51.098
Don't leave me, Sophie.

49:59.231 --> 50:00.774
Try a little milk?

50:11.160 --> 50:13.954
The Witch of the Waste
is searching for my house.

50:16.707 --> 50:18.709
You're right, I saw her cronies
down at the port.

50:19.501 --> 50:21.962
The truth is, I'm a coward.

50:22.171 --> 50:25.674
All this junk is just sorcery
to keep her away.

50:25.883 --> 50:27.468
I'm scared to death.

50:29.261 --> 50:32.473
Tell me, why is
the Witch of the Waste after you?

50:33.390 --> 50:37.353
She seemed quite interesting,
so I approached her.

50:37.561 --> 50:40.981
But she terrified me
and I ran away.

50:44.109 --> 50:47.196
Now the king's ordered me
to report to him.

50:47.404 --> 50:49.782
As Jenkins and as Pendragon...

50:49.990 --> 50:52.409
How many names do you use, Howl?

50:52.618 --> 50:54.912
Enough to guarantee my freedom.

50:56.288 --> 50:58.499
Can't you refuse the king?

50:58.707 --> 50:59.833
See that...

51:00.584 --> 51:04.546
The oath I took at
the Sorcery Academy.

51:06.965 --> 51:09.426
Say, Howl.
Why not visit the king?

51:09.927 --> 51:11.136
What!

51:11.970 --> 51:13.430
Just say it to his face.

51:13.639 --> 51:17.267
"Stop this foolish war
I refuse to help you."

51:19.812 --> 51:22.189
Sophie, you don't know
what they're like.

51:22.981 --> 51:23.941
But he's the king, right?

51:24.149 --> 51:27.361
A king thinks only
of what's best for his people.

51:28.570 --> 51:29.696
I know!

51:29.988 --> 51:32.116
You'll go in my place, Sophie!

51:34.201 --> 51:36.703
Pretend you're Pendragon's mother.

51:36.954 --> 51:40.124
Just tell him your son is
an idle good-for-nothing.

51:40.833 --> 51:43.127
Maybe Madam Suliman
will even give up on me.

51:43.710 --> 51:45.504
Madam Suliman?

51:48.924 --> 51:50.634
You're wearing that hat?

51:50.926 --> 51:53.137
After all the magic I spent
making your dress pretty...

51:53.345 --> 51:54.304
Off I go.

51:54.513 --> 51:55.556
Sure!

51:55.889 --> 51:57.724
See you later!

52:05.941 --> 52:08.318
This charm
assures your safe return.

52:10.404 --> 52:13.240
Don't worry,
I'll follow you in disguise.

52:13.657 --> 52:14.992
There.
Off you go!

52:23.208 --> 52:25.836
I'm sure this will never work.

52:34.720 --> 52:38.015
I don't suppose he's following me,
disguised as a crow.

52:45.063 --> 52:47.191
I'm sure Howl would pick
a more dramatic disguise

52:53.739 --> 52:54.865
Not that...

53:06.668 --> 53:09.254
The Palace is so far away.

53:51.129 --> 53:54.091
Howl?
Don't tell me you're Howl.

54:00.138 --> 54:02.933
Disguising yourself as an old dog,
of all things.

54:03.141 --> 54:05.268
Do you know how exhausting
it is to be old?

54:08.647 --> 54:11.692
How nice to see you.
The little hatter, right?

54:12.150 --> 54:13.652
The Witch of the Waste!

54:13.860 --> 54:16.780
Thank you so much for
delivering my note to Howl.

54:19.449 --> 54:21.284
How's Howl doing?

54:21.743 --> 54:23.453
Quite terrified.

54:23.662 --> 54:26.748
Thanks to him,
I've become a cleaning lady.

54:27.874 --> 54:29.626
My, how delightful.

54:30.669 --> 54:33.880
By the way, what brings you
to see the king?

54:34.089 --> 54:37.467
Job hunting.
I'm sick of working for Howl.

54:37.676 --> 54:38.635
And yourself?

54:39.344 --> 54:41.930
The king invited me.

54:42.180 --> 54:44.725
It seems that idiot, Suliman,

54:44.933 --> 54:46.643
finally needs my power.

54:47.060 --> 54:50.272
Why don't you break the spell
you put on me?

54:50.730 --> 54:52.232
That's impossible.

54:52.441 --> 54:56.486
My gifts lie in casting spells,
not breaking them.

54:56.695 --> 54:58.947
See you later, then.

54:59.448 --> 55:02.826
Hey, wait a minute!
Just wait!

55:04.161 --> 55:06.663
If you weren't here,
I'd have hit her with my cane.

55:24.723 --> 55:26.016
What's wrong with you?

55:26.349 --> 55:29.728
Madam, vehicles are prohibited
beyond this point.

55:29.936 --> 55:31.354
Please continue on foot.

55:31.938 --> 55:33.356
That Suliman!

55:33.565 --> 55:37.402
Using magic to force me
to climb these stairs.

55:48.413 --> 55:50.790
We'll catch up.
Pay her no mind.

56:16.024 --> 56:18.944
Heavy, why are you so heavy?

56:28.954 --> 56:32.749
You... Hey... Wait.

56:33.166 --> 56:34.501
What is it?

56:34.709 --> 56:38.797
Suddenly remembered...
how to break my spell?

56:39.005 --> 56:42.592
I told you...

56:42.926 --> 56:43.760
I don't know how.

56:44.135 --> 56:45.929
Then, start studying up.

56:50.725 --> 56:52.769
I don't get it.

56:52.978 --> 56:56.106
Where does she get all that energy?

57:04.406 --> 57:06.199
I have to put you down.

57:12.664 --> 57:16.292
Why don't you call it a day?
You can't make it.

57:17.043 --> 57:19.170
It's been 50 years now,

57:19.379 --> 57:21.840
since they drove me out of here...

57:22.215 --> 57:24.050
I've been longing

57:24.259 --> 57:26.970
for this day, ever since...

57:27.220 --> 57:28.888
Good luck to you, then.

57:29.097 --> 57:32.225
Still, I'm not nice enough
to help you out.

57:32.892 --> 57:34.394
Come, Howl.

57:35.687 --> 57:37.605
You heartless wench!

57:37.814 --> 57:40.316
Next time I'll turn you feeble, too!

58:01.379 --> 58:03.381
Hurry up!

58:04.299 --> 58:06.426
Madam, follow me.

58:06.760 --> 58:09.763
First, you should help her.

58:09.971 --> 58:12.849
We are forbidden to assist anyone.

58:13.099 --> 58:16.186
But the king himself invited her.

58:16.394 --> 58:18.646
Hang in there!

58:19.564 --> 58:21.232
Just a little farther!

58:22.192 --> 58:24.486
And you call yourself a witch?

58:25.820 --> 58:27.530
Who asked you?

58:30.241 --> 58:32.076
You suddenly look older.

58:33.203 --> 58:36.372
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

58:37.957 --> 58:39.459
Pull yourself together.

58:39.667 --> 58:41.961
Isn't this
what you've been waiting for?

58:45.215 --> 58:48.468
Madam Pendragon and
the Witch of the Waste!

58:48.676 --> 58:52.722
Pendragon...
That name sounds familiar.

58:52.931 --> 58:56.392
Of course it does.
That was the name of my hat shop.

58:56.601 --> 58:57.602
It was?

58:58.228 --> 58:59.979
Please wait here.

59:06.486 --> 59:07.570
A chair!

59:07.946 --> 59:09.739
It's mine!

59:21.417 --> 59:23.419
Howl, get back here!

59:31.636 --> 59:33.179
Madam, this way please.

01:00:33.614 --> 01:00:35.616
I understand you're Howl's mother.

01:00:36.701 --> 01:00:38.619
Yes.
My name is Pendragon.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.622
I'm sure you're weary.
Please have a seat.

01:00:42.290 --> 01:00:43.332
Yes.

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:56.637
I am Madam Suliman,
His Majesty's witch.

01:01:02.894 --> 01:01:04.145
Um, that dog is...

01:01:04.937 --> 01:01:06.397
Ah, you mean Heen?

01:01:06.606 --> 01:01:09.984
He does my errands.
I asked him to escort you.

01:01:14.363 --> 01:01:16.491
Howl won't join us, then?

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:21.120
You see, he sends his mother
to make excuses.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.998
I'm sure he'd be utterly useless
to His Majesty.

01:01:25.374 --> 01:01:27.835
What a shame.

01:01:28.044 --> 01:01:31.172
He was my last apprentice...

01:01:32.215 --> 01:01:35.343
A student of such marvelous gifts.

01:01:35.593 --> 01:01:39.472
I rejoiced in finally finding
a worthy heir.

01:01:41.807 --> 01:01:45.019
But then, a demon stole his heart,

01:01:45.228 --> 01:01:47.355
and he abandoned me.

01:01:47.563 --> 01:01:51.692
He turned his magic
to purely selfish uses.

01:01:53.945 --> 01:01:55.279
Mrs. Pendragon.

01:01:55.738 --> 01:01:57.532
That boy is dangerous.

01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.869
His power is too great
for one with no heart.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.041
If he follows that path he'll wind up
like the Witch of the Waste.

01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:08.042
Bring her!

01:02:14.757 --> 01:02:16.259
What happened?

01:02:18.511 --> 01:02:21.430
I just restored her to her real age.

01:02:21.639 --> 01:02:23.182
All her powers are gone.

01:02:23.849 --> 01:02:27.728
Once upon a time,
she was a magnificent witch.

01:02:28.354 --> 01:02:31.023
She made a bargain with a demon.

01:02:31.232 --> 01:02:34.318
Who consumed her, body and soul,
long, long ago.

01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:38.322
Our kingdom can no longer afford
to turn a blind eye

01:02:38.531 --> 01:02:40.449
to disreputable wizards and witches.

01:02:40.658 --> 01:02:44.036
If Howl comes here
to serve the kingdom,

01:02:44.245 --> 01:02:46.956
I will teach him how to break
with the demon.

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:51.252
If not, I'll strip him of his powers
as I have taken hers.

01:02:52.545 --> 01:02:53.421
Now just a minute.

01:02:55.214 --> 01:02:58.092
Now I understand why Howl
refused to come here.

01:02:58.759 --> 01:03:00.136
Something's not right.

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:03.014
Forcing your aged guests
to climb stairs, dragging them

01:03:03.222 --> 01:03:05.933
into strange rooms...
It's like a trap.

01:03:06.475 --> 01:03:08.311
You call Howl heartless!

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:12.273
Yes, he's selfish and cowardly
and unpredictable.

01:03:12.481 --> 01:03:15.985
But he's straight as an arrow.
He only wants to be free.

01:03:16.610 --> 01:03:19.280
Howl won't turn into an evil monster.

01:03:19.488 --> 01:03:22.116
He'll battle the demon on his own.

01:03:22.324 --> 01:03:23.993
I believe in him.

01:03:24.744 --> 01:03:27.288
Mrs. Pendragon...
You're in love with Howl.

01:03:28.289 --> 01:03:31.167
Howl...
Howl's coming?

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:34.628
I want Howl's heart, I want it!

01:03:34.837 --> 01:03:38.299
That's enough from you.
Howl's not coming.

01:03:40.051 --> 01:03:42.011
Howl will most certainly come.

01:03:43.054 --> 01:03:45.556
Now, I've found his weakness.

01:03:52.354 --> 01:03:53.314
Your Majesty.

01:03:53.522 --> 01:03:55.066
As you are.

01:03:55.274 --> 01:03:56.650
How are you feeling?

01:03:56.859 --> 01:03:58.110
Thank you for asking

01:03:58.319 --> 01:04:01.530
Meetings bore me.
I flew out for a breather.

01:04:02.281 --> 01:04:03.491
How lovely.

01:04:03.699 --> 01:04:05.201
These are...?

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:07.828
This is Wizard Howl's mother.

01:04:08.037 --> 01:04:09.330
I see.

01:04:13.334 --> 01:04:17.671
I appreciate it, but I don't intend
to win any war with magic.

01:04:18.547 --> 01:04:21.300
It's true that Suliman's powers
shield our palace from bombs.

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:22.927
But they just fall on
neighboring towns.

01:04:23.135 --> 01:04:25.638
That's how magic works.
Right, Suliman?

01:04:25.846 --> 01:04:28.307
Such eloquence today, Your Majesty.

01:04:28.516 --> 01:04:30.518
Suliman!

01:04:30.893 --> 01:04:32.228
This is the final battle.
This time, we'll beat them to a pulp.

01:04:35.397 --> 01:04:39.235
Suliman, you've outdone yourself
with that double. Await good news.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:46.367
Thank you kindly.

01:04:46.575 --> 01:04:47.701
Have my generals assembled?

01:04:48.577 --> 01:04:50.329
It's been awhile, Howl.

01:04:54.416 --> 01:04:57.169
Delighted to see you doing so well.

01:04:57.378 --> 01:04:59.380
I saw right through you.

01:04:59.588 --> 01:05:01.674
Not a very clever disguise.

01:05:01.882 --> 01:05:03.634
I've kept my oath.

01:05:04.134 --> 01:05:06.303
I've no wish to fight you.

01:05:06.762 --> 01:05:08.097
I'll take my mother.

01:05:08.389 --> 01:05:10.057
I won't let you go.

01:05:31.704 --> 01:05:33.664
Don't look down,
you'll be dragged down.

01:05:34.415 --> 01:05:38.210
It's time I showed your mother
what you really are.

01:06:32.598 --> 01:06:34.183
Howl, don't! It's a trap!

01:06:47.529 --> 01:06:48.614
Hold tight!

01:06:56.497 --> 01:06:58.123
Sophie, sit up front.

01:06:59.917 --> 01:07:03.796
Oh, no, Sophie,
you brought the whole gang along.

01:07:05.130 --> 01:07:06.381
Nice doggie.

01:07:07.049 --> 01:07:10.094
You're just Suliman's spy.

01:07:10.302 --> 01:07:12.930
Oh, well, too late to toss you now.

01:07:13.138 --> 01:07:14.515
Sophie, you steer.

01:07:14.723 --> 01:07:17.101
What! I can't possibly!

01:07:17.309 --> 01:07:18.685
They're after us.

01:07:23.816 --> 01:07:27.027
I'll tackle them. Fly straight
to the castle in the Wastes.

01:07:27.236 --> 01:07:28.987
What! That's impossible!

01:07:29.196 --> 01:07:32.157
Don't worry,
the ring will guide you.

01:07:32.366 --> 01:07:34.535
Summon Calcifer with your heart.

01:07:34.743 --> 01:07:36.203
Summon Calcifer?

01:07:39.623 --> 01:07:40.666
It's glowing!

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:45.045
Follow the light.
You'll be there by nightfall.

01:07:45.254 --> 01:07:48.674
Why send me to Suliman
if you were coming yourself?

01:07:48.882 --> 01:07:51.343
Your presence gave me
the courage for it.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:53.720
She's too terrible to
face on my own.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:58.392
You've saved me.
I was in grave danger back there.

01:08:00.435 --> 01:08:01.895
Don't let go!

01:08:08.610 --> 01:08:10.153
- You're good
- Stop joking!

01:08:12.781 --> 01:08:14.408
We've got a lead now.

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:17.493
I can give you 5 minutes of
invisibility, now's your chance.

01:08:21.206 --> 01:08:22.499
Howl!

01:08:34.803 --> 01:08:36.638
No, thank you.

01:08:37.139 --> 01:08:40.517
Thank you. That's the most fun
I've had in ages.

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.020
I supposed Howl thinks
he's escaped...

01:08:44.438 --> 01:08:47.064
His mother's awfully young.

01:09:38.033 --> 01:09:40.160
We're not far.
That's my hometown.

01:09:43.997 --> 01:09:47.000
Don't look so friendly.
I don't trust you.

01:10:11.191 --> 01:10:13.026
The castle.
They've come to meet us!

01:10:17.906 --> 01:10:20.033
Sophie!

01:10:20.492 --> 01:10:22.035
Markl, help!

01:10:22.244 --> 01:10:24.037
I don't know how to stop this thing!

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:37.926
Sophie!

01:10:38.927 --> 01:10:40.387
Doggie.

01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:43.348
Markl!

01:10:44.432 --> 01:10:45.600
I'm home.

01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:47.936
Sophie, are you hurt?

01:10:49.104 --> 01:10:50.147
You're home!

01:10:50.355 --> 01:10:53.066
Thank you for coming to meet us.

01:11:24.014 --> 01:11:26.141
Oh, no, you've gone too far.

01:11:44.951 --> 01:11:46.911
I wonder if Howl's back.

01:12:41.466 --> 01:12:42.592
Howl?

01:13:45.196 --> 01:13:46.739
Howl? Is it you?

01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:52.120
Are you hurt? In pain?

01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:55.123
Stay away.

01:13:55.456 --> 01:13:57.417
I want to help you.

01:13:57.625 --> 01:13:59.460
I want to break
the spell you're under.

01:14:00.753 --> 01:14:03.965
You can't even break
your own spell!

01:14:04.424 --> 01:14:06.467
But I love you!

01:14:06.926 --> 01:14:08.720
Too late.

01:14:12.932 --> 01:14:14.183
Howl!

01:14:27.405 --> 01:14:28.948
Howl must be back.

01:14:29.157 --> 01:14:33.494
Sophie, you'd better figure out
how to break my spell quick.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.080
We're both running out of time.

01:14:36.456 --> 01:14:39.083
Meaning Howl will turn into
a monster? Is it true?

01:14:39.292 --> 01:14:41.377
I can't tell you that.

01:14:41.586 --> 01:14:42.712
I'm a demon.

01:14:44.672 --> 01:14:46.925
Calcifer, Suliman told me,

01:14:47.133 --> 01:14:49.969
Howl has given you
something very precious.

01:14:50.178 --> 01:14:52.096
What is it?
Where is it?

01:14:52.305 --> 01:14:54.933
That's confidential information.

01:14:55.141 --> 01:14:57.602
And if I threaten
to dump water over you?

01:14:57.810 --> 01:15:00.355
How dare you!
Howl will die with me!

01:15:20.375 --> 01:15:21.834
Good morning, Turnip.

01:15:22.043 --> 01:15:23.961
We've got to be brave.

01:15:27.298 --> 01:15:29.300
Ready, Sophie!

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:32.762
Ok! Open wider, Calcifer!

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.974
Here goes! Push!

01:15:37.183 --> 01:15:38.726
Heave!

01:15:46.734 --> 01:15:51.406
I... said... move!

01:15:51.656 --> 01:15:52.990
Come on!

01:16:14.846 --> 01:16:18.683
They call it a castle, but once
you get inside, it's a junk heap.

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:23.229
It's time to eat!

01:16:29.735 --> 01:16:31.279
Here, old girl.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:35.241
But, Sophie
she's the Witch of the Waste.

01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:36.993
No need to worry.

01:16:37.201 --> 01:16:39.203
Why's she staring at me?

01:16:39.495 --> 01:16:41.747
Such a pretty fire.

01:16:44.667 --> 01:16:45.543
Howl!

01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:46.878
Hello, everyone.

01:16:47.086 --> 01:16:50.173
- Welcome home.
- Master Howl, can we keep this puppy?

01:16:50.923 --> 01:16:53.801
An old Witch and
Madam Suliman's dog.

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.179
Why'd you let them in, Calcifer?

01:16:56.929 --> 01:16:57.805
Don't look at me!

01:16:58.014 --> 01:17:00.433
They blew in with Sophie.

01:17:03.436 --> 01:17:05.188
Sophie, always dramatic...

01:17:05.688 --> 01:17:08.107
So you're Turnip.

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:12.612
You're under quite a spell, too.

01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:15.865
Seems everyone in our little family
is complicated...

01:17:16.073 --> 01:17:18.075
He's so handsome.

01:17:18.784 --> 01:17:21.704
This is a busy day.
We're moving.

01:17:22.121 --> 01:17:22.997
Moving?

01:17:23.206 --> 01:17:26.209
Oh, good. There aren't any shops,
here in the middle of nowhere.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:30.129
Madam Suliman can track us down
in no time, here.

01:17:30.504 --> 01:17:34.467
But you'll have to stay behind.
The magic in your spell's too risky.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:42.141
All right, that's done.

01:17:42.850 --> 01:17:45.019
Take it away, Calcifer.

01:18:00.076 --> 01:18:01.619
Excellent.

01:18:01.827 --> 01:18:03.287
Stay right where you are.

01:18:06.832 --> 01:18:08.709
Be gentle...

01:18:12.213 --> 01:18:13.297
Here goes.

01:18:57.883 --> 01:19:00.594
We've moved.
You can get up now.

01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:05.015
Amazing, Master!
It's so grand!

01:19:05.766 --> 01:19:08.394
What a pretty fire.

01:19:22.450 --> 01:19:23.868
This is...

01:19:24.076 --> 01:19:27.496
I added a bathroom.
For our growing family.

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:31.292
Sophie, come here!
Sophie!

01:19:34.211 --> 01:19:37.089
I added a bedroom, too.
Go in.

01:19:47.725 --> 01:19:49.310
This is... why?

01:19:49.727 --> 01:19:52.730
I thought it would suit you.
Do you like it?

01:19:54.315 --> 01:19:57.568
Yes, it's perfect
for a housekeeper.

01:19:57.776 --> 01:20:00.613
I got you new clothes, too.
Open them later. Next.

01:20:01.614 --> 01:20:04.200
Sophie! Come here!
Quick!

01:20:05.201 --> 01:20:06.577
A courtyard!

01:20:06.785 --> 01:20:08.204
There's a shop, too.

01:20:08.954 --> 01:20:10.539
Let's go, Heen!

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:14.418
See that new color on the dial?
There's a new exit.

01:20:17.796 --> 01:20:20.466
My gift to you, Sophie.
Step outside.

01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:47.785
It's my secret garden.

01:20:48.494 --> 01:20:49.995
Beautiful.

01:20:52.373 --> 01:20:54.625
Did you make it with your magic?

01:20:55.042 --> 01:20:57.795
Only a little, to help the flowers.

01:21:07.012 --> 01:21:09.473
Thank you, Howl!

01:21:09.682 --> 01:21:11.016
It's like I'm dreaming.

01:21:34.123 --> 01:21:35.290
Sophie.

01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:41.213
How mysterious.
I feel I've been here before.

01:21:41.422 --> 01:21:43.298
I could cry with happiness.

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:44.717
Come.

01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:54.184
Look.

01:21:59.732 --> 01:22:01.108
A sweet little house!

01:22:01.316 --> 01:22:03.110
My favorite hideaway.

01:22:03.902 --> 01:22:07.489
When I was little I spent
my summers there alone.

01:22:09.032 --> 01:22:10.367
Alone?

01:22:11.076 --> 01:22:12.453
My Uncle, the Wizard,

01:22:12.661 --> 01:22:14.705
left it to me in secret.

01:22:15.122 --> 01:22:17.583
Make yourself at home there, Sophie.

01:22:21.545 --> 01:22:22.379
What's wrong?

01:22:23.213 --> 01:22:24.214
I'm scared.

01:22:24.423 --> 01:22:27.259
I'm afraid you'll go off and disappear
somewhere, once I'm inside.

01:22:30.095 --> 01:22:32.306
Howl, tell me the truth.

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:35.267
I don't mind if you're a monster.

01:22:41.064 --> 01:22:44.526
I want to make sure that
you'll all live comfortably.

01:22:44.943 --> 01:22:49.031
Why not a flower shop,
with all these flowers?

01:22:49.448 --> 01:22:51.742
You'd be good at it, Sophie.

01:22:52.034 --> 01:22:54.077
And then, you'd go away?

01:22:55.996 --> 01:22:58.916
I want to help you, Howl.

01:22:59.333 --> 01:23:03.045
I'm not beautiful
and I'm only good at cleaning...

01:23:03.587 --> 01:23:06.131
Sophie, you are beautiful.

01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.847
The good thing about being old
is that you've so little to lose...

01:23:27.653 --> 01:23:29.488
Why's that flying here?

01:23:29.696 --> 01:23:30.405
A battleship?

01:23:30.614 --> 01:23:31.949
On its way to burn cities and people.

01:23:32.532 --> 01:23:35.369
- The enemy's? Ours?
- What difference does it make?

01:23:48.382 --> 01:23:49.466
Murderers.

01:23:57.182 --> 01:23:59.893
Look at all those bombs.

01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:17.119
It stopped.

01:24:17.327 --> 01:24:18.829
Did you do that?

01:24:19.037 --> 01:24:21.456
I'm just tinkering.
It won't crash.

01:24:25.043 --> 01:24:25.836
Howl!

01:24:26.211 --> 01:24:28.630
Oops, looks like they're onto us.

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:41.435
Madam Suliman's deputies.
Let's go back.

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:43.770
Run! Move those legs!

01:24:58.035 --> 01:24:59.161
Hurry on in!

01:24:59.369 --> 01:25:01.204
No! Don't let go!

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.174
What happened, Sophie?

01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:15.093
I've had it with this place!

01:25:25.103 --> 01:25:26.897
Good night, Sophie.

01:25:27.105 --> 01:25:28.315
Good night.

01:25:30.317 --> 01:25:32.569
Don't worry about Master Howl, Sophie.

01:25:32.778 --> 01:25:34.738
Sometimes, he's gone for days on end.

01:25:35.781 --> 01:25:37.240
Thank you, Markl.

01:25:37.699 --> 01:25:40.076
- Need the toilet?
- I'm fine.

01:25:40.285 --> 01:25:42.204
Good night.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:43.371
You're in love.

01:25:46.458 --> 01:25:49.628
Sighing away like that.

01:26:01.473 --> 01:26:03.141
I thought so.

01:26:03.475 --> 01:26:05.769
Were you ever in love?

01:26:05.977 --> 01:26:08.730
Of course I was.
I'm still in love.

01:26:08.939 --> 01:26:09.856
What?

01:26:10.357 --> 01:26:13.568
Men, why ever should we want them...

01:26:13.777 --> 01:26:15.862
But a young man's heart
is so delicious!

01:26:16.488 --> 01:26:17.864
Unbelievable.

01:26:18.448 --> 01:26:20.951
And so adorable, too.

01:26:24.371 --> 01:26:27.165
- What is that?
- Air raid siren.

01:26:28.291 --> 01:26:29.084
Air raid?

01:26:30.627 --> 01:26:31.753
It's not for here.

01:26:31.962 --> 01:26:34.631
But best not go out tonight.

01:26:36.299 --> 01:26:39.386
Suliman's creatures
are searching high and low

01:26:39.594 --> 01:26:40.679
for our house.

01:26:43.807 --> 01:26:47.686
What a good fire,
hiding us so well

01:27:23.138 --> 01:27:25.432
Sophie, a stranger got in!

01:27:33.148 --> 01:27:33.982
Mother?

01:27:34.441 --> 01:27:36.443
Sophie!

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.698
Where have you been?
I searched for you everywhere!

01:27:42.198 --> 01:27:44.701
But, oh, look how you've aged!

01:27:45.368 --> 01:27:47.412
It's all my fault!

01:27:49.289 --> 01:27:51.791
I'm so sorry, Sophie!

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.835
Mother...

01:27:56.379 --> 01:27:58.673
I barely recognize the house.

01:27:58.882 --> 01:28:00.633
Who is that?

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.677
Oh, your landlady.

01:28:02.886 --> 01:28:05.972
Sophie, I've got a new husband!

01:28:06.473 --> 01:28:07.849
He's such a wonderful man.

01:28:08.058 --> 01:28:10.810
And he's rich, too!
We can all live together again.

01:28:11.227 --> 01:28:13.563
You'll never have to clean again.

01:28:14.314 --> 01:28:17.358
But I'm happy here...

01:28:17.567 --> 01:28:18.985
Really?

01:28:19.194 --> 01:28:20.070
Oops, I forgot!

01:28:20.403 --> 01:28:23.031
My car's waiting.
I've got to run.

01:28:27.368 --> 01:28:30.789
I'm so glad I found you again.

01:28:30.997 --> 01:28:32.999
We'll really catch up next time.

01:28:33.208 --> 01:28:35.335
In the meantime, you take care.

01:28:41.049 --> 01:28:42.050
A peeping-bug, eh?

01:28:42.258 --> 01:28:45.011
The oldest trick in the book, Suliman.

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:46.679
All yours, Cal.

01:28:56.356 --> 01:28:58.650
May you find happiness, Mother.

01:28:58.858 --> 01:29:01.361
Thank you.
You too, Sophie.

01:29:05.448 --> 01:29:08.576
I've done what I was told.
Take me back to my husband.

01:29:08.785 --> 01:29:11.579
Yes, I'm sure Madam Suliman
will be pleased.

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.583
Forgive me, Sophie...

01:29:19.754 --> 01:29:21.047
Look at all these people.

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:25.051
They're all running away.
The town will be empty.

01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.428
Do you wish to run, too?

01:29:28.555 --> 01:29:30.557
That's what that lady spoke of...

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:34.310
So, she did.
I'm glad we made up.

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:36.646
Don't go, Sophie!

01:29:37.689 --> 01:29:40.900
I love you, Sophie.
Please stay.

01:29:42.443 --> 01:29:45.238
I love you, too, Markl.
Don't worry, I won't go.

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:46.656
Really!

01:29:47.615 --> 01:29:49.075
Are we a family?

01:29:49.325 --> 01:29:51.077
Yes, we're family

01:29:51.744 --> 01:29:53.121
Oh, good!

01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:03.923
I'll never let Suliman
get hold of Howl.

01:30:20.982 --> 01:30:23.109
But the paper says we won.

01:30:23.318 --> 01:30:26.070
Only fools swallow such lies.

01:30:27.196 --> 01:30:30.658
How strange.
I can't get Calcifer going.

01:30:31.409 --> 01:30:33.119
Grandma, will you stop that?

01:30:33.411 --> 01:30:34.912
Such an awful stink.

01:30:35.121 --> 01:30:38.041
Why deny an old lady her pleasures.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:40.543
Open the window, Markl

01:30:44.464 --> 01:30:46.632
I wouldn't open that now...

01:30:48.426 --> 01:30:51.054
In Calcifer's present state,
he can't possibly

01:30:51.262 --> 01:30:52.972
keep them out.

01:30:55.016 --> 01:30:56.100
Markl!

01:31:06.944 --> 01:31:08.237
Close it quick!

01:31:14.827 --> 01:31:17.371
Look after Grandma, Markl.
I'll check on the shop.

01:31:36.307 --> 01:31:37.892
How dare you, now?

01:31:38.101 --> 01:31:40.353
If you've energy to spare,
put out the fires.

01:32:04.794 --> 01:32:05.545
Howl!

01:32:19.308 --> 01:32:20.726
Dramatic as usual...

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:34.907
Howl!

01:32:37.243 --> 01:32:38.202
I'm sorry.
I had too many enemies, tonight.

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:43.124
Howl, oh, Howl!

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:02.226
Master Howl!
Sophie!

01:33:04.979 --> 01:33:07.940
Calcifer, be strong.

01:33:12.778 --> 01:33:16.907
Madam, was that a gift
from Suliman?

01:33:17.366 --> 01:33:20.244
That granny fed me something nasty!

01:33:21.037 --> 01:33:23.247
Why, if it isn't Howl!

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:27.585
I feel we need a nice long chat.

01:33:28.252 --> 01:33:29.670
Likewise, Madam.

01:33:29.879 --> 01:33:31.964
But we've no time, now.

01:33:32.548 --> 01:33:36.677
How unlike you.
You're not running away.

01:33:36.927 --> 01:33:38.512
Until later, then.

01:33:39.513 --> 01:33:42.516
Stay here, Sophie.
Calcifer will protect you.

01:33:42.725 --> 01:33:44.518
I'll see to things outside.

01:33:46.187 --> 01:33:47.480
Wait, Howl!

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:50.149
Don't go! Please stay.

01:33:50.775 --> 01:33:54.028
Another round of bombs is coming.
Even Calcifer can't stop those.

01:33:54.612 --> 01:33:56.364
Let's run away!
Don't fight.

01:33:56.906 --> 01:33:59.367
I'm through running away.

01:34:00.159 --> 01:34:03.162
I've finally found someone
I want to protect...

01:34:03.371 --> 01:34:04.497
You.

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:10.211
Howl!

01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:36.255
That's our town.

01:35:41.010 --> 01:35:42.011
There's Howl.

01:35:51.729 --> 01:35:52.479
Howl!

01:36:02.573 --> 01:36:04.325
Sophie!
Turnip...

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:09.955
Markl, come inside!

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:13.125
Move? You're nuts.
There's nothing there.

01:36:13.459 --> 01:36:16.587
No, as long as we stay here,
Howl will keep fighting.

01:36:17.171 --> 01:36:20.382
He's better off a coward.
Grandma, get up.

01:36:20.591 --> 01:36:21.967
Going for a stroll?

01:36:22.509 --> 01:36:24.345
Suliman will find us, right away!

01:36:24.762 --> 01:36:28.057
She already has. At this rate,
Howl will never make it back alive.

01:36:28.265 --> 01:36:29.475
Sophie!

01:36:29.683 --> 01:36:30.851
The castle's falling apart.

01:36:31.143 --> 01:36:33.187
That's all right.
Markl, take Grandma.

01:36:33.395 --> 01:36:34.313
Sure.

01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:37.983
You, too, hop up now.

01:36:38.525 --> 01:36:41.987
I can't! My contract says
I can't leave the fireplace.

01:36:42.571 --> 01:36:44.990
If you two can't solve this,
I'll do it for you.

01:36:45.366 --> 01:36:46.909
Watch it!

01:36:47.368 --> 01:36:49.328
Cut it out! Cut it out!

01:36:50.496 --> 01:36:52.539
If I leave,
the house will collapse.

01:36:52.748 --> 01:36:53.540
Fine!

01:36:57.544 --> 01:36:58.837
We're out.

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:01.006
I'd better go last.

01:37:02.257 --> 01:37:05.427
Even I don't know what'll happen...

01:37:34.289 --> 01:37:36.500
I told you, it would collapse.

01:37:36.708 --> 01:37:37.876
Rain!

01:37:40.587 --> 01:37:42.047
Is that heading for town?

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.799
Look after Grandma, Markl.

01:37:44.007 --> 01:37:45.759
Turnip, find us a way in.

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:49.221
Don't worry, Grandma.
I'll take care of you.

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:54.393
Markl, we can get in here.

01:38:04.153 --> 01:38:06.738
The roof's leaking.
I'll go out.

01:38:07.322 --> 01:38:08.574
Wait here.

01:38:08.782 --> 01:38:10.951
It's wet here...

01:38:16.832 --> 01:38:18.083
Hurry!

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:21.795
Too damp!

01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:27.217
Bring Grandma here, Markl.

01:38:27.676 --> 01:38:29.344
The castle's empty.

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:33.348
I told you, if we'd stayed put,
Howl and I could've handled it.

01:38:35.475 --> 01:38:38.103
Calcifer, please.
You're my last hope.

01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:41.481
I want to go to Howl.
Move the castle.

01:38:42.774 --> 01:38:46.194
I know you can do it.
You're so strong.

01:38:46.778 --> 01:38:49.990
But there's no chimney here...

01:38:50.282 --> 01:38:51.533
And the wood's damp...

01:38:52.326 --> 01:38:54.745
As the saying goes,
"The best blaze brightest

01:38:54.953 --> 01:38:56.622
in adversity".

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:59.458
I've heard that, but...

01:38:59.666 --> 01:39:00.709
You really think so?

01:39:00.959 --> 01:39:02.836
You're so pretty, Cal.

01:39:03.045 --> 01:39:04.129
Sit here, Grandma.

01:39:04.755 --> 01:39:07.215
Then, give me something
of yours, Sophie.

01:39:07.549 --> 01:39:08.467
Of mine?

01:39:08.675 --> 01:39:11.094
I can't do it alone.
How about your eyes?

01:39:11.303 --> 01:39:12.387
My eyes?

01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:13.972
This?

01:40:19.579 --> 01:40:22.082
Amazing, Calcifer!
You are the best!

01:40:22.874 --> 01:40:25.419
Imagine what I could do with
your eyes and your heart.

01:40:25.752 --> 01:40:28.547
Heart! You have a heart?

01:40:31.591 --> 01:40:33.051
Oh, my!

01:40:45.605 --> 01:40:47.941
There's Howl.
He's trapped!

01:40:53.447 --> 01:40:55.115
Hurry, Calcifer!

01:40:55.824 --> 01:40:57.242
Don't!

01:40:58.034 --> 01:40:58.952
Grandma!

01:40:59.703 --> 01:41:00.912
Stop it!

01:41:01.872 --> 01:41:03.748
Howl's heart!

01:41:05.083 --> 01:41:06.001
Cut it out!

01:41:15.886 --> 01:41:16.761
Grandma!

01:41:19.139 --> 01:41:20.891
It's hot, hot!

01:41:21.433 --> 01:41:22.684
Let go!

01:41:23.226 --> 01:41:24.728
You'll die, Grandma!

01:41:24.936 --> 01:41:26.938
No, it's mine!

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:46.791
Sophie!

01:41:50.545 --> 01:41:51.671
Sophie!

01:41:52.505 --> 01:41:55.800
She's so mean.
That's mine.

01:42:39.135 --> 01:42:42.597
Oh, no, Heen, look what I've done.
I poured water on Calcifer.

01:42:45.767 --> 01:42:48.520
What if I've killed Howl, too?

01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:17.757
It's moving...
Is Howl alive?

01:43:17.966 --> 01:43:19.759
Show me where he is.

01:43:41.531 --> 01:43:43.074
The castle door...

01:45:01.402 --> 01:45:02.362
Heen...

01:45:37.939 --> 01:45:38.773
Howl...

01:45:57.583 --> 01:46:00.003
This must be Howl's childhood...

01:47:19.248 --> 01:47:20.917
Howl!
Calcifer!

01:47:23.169 --> 01:47:26.506
It's Sophie! Wait for me!
I promise I'll come back for you!

01:47:28.216 --> 01:47:30.092
Wait for me in the future!

01:48:03.292 --> 01:48:06.087
I'll walk there.
Heen, I'll walk.

01:48:06.587 --> 01:48:08.089
I can't stop crying.

01:48:32.655 --> 01:48:33.948
Howl.

01:48:40.496 --> 01:48:43.374
I'm sorry I took so long.

01:48:43.666 --> 01:48:46.294
You've been waiting all this time.

01:48:50.965 --> 01:48:53.467
Take me to Calcifer.

01:49:56.572 --> 01:49:57.490
Is he dead?

01:49:57.698 --> 01:49:59.366
No, he's fine.

01:50:03.913 --> 01:50:05.206
Grandma...

01:50:05.414 --> 01:50:08.918
Don't look at me.
I don't have anything.

01:50:09.418 --> 01:50:10.252
Please.

01:50:12.838 --> 01:50:14.215
Grandma.

01:50:17.051 --> 01:50:19.553
You want it that badly?

01:50:19.762 --> 01:50:20.805
Yes.

01:50:21.764 --> 01:50:25.726
Oh, well, in that case...
You'd better take good care of it.

01:50:26.352 --> 01:50:27.645
There.

01:50:28.938 --> 01:50:31.190
Thank you, Grandma.

01:50:47.331 --> 01:50:48.582
Calcifer.

01:50:49.959 --> 01:50:52.586
Sophie...
I'm all worn out.

01:50:52.795 --> 01:50:56.090
If I give Howl's heart back,
will it kill you?

01:50:56.298 --> 01:50:58.676
Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:03.639
After all, we both survived
the water you dumped on me.

01:51:03.847 --> 01:51:05.266
I'd better try, then.

01:51:08.727 --> 01:51:11.939
It's all warm and fluttery
like a little bird.

01:51:12.147 --> 01:51:14.191
It's still only a child's heart.

01:51:15.317 --> 01:51:18.279
May Calcifer live a thousand years,

01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:21.448
and may Howl recover his heart...

01:51:33.335 --> 01:51:34.211
I'm alive!

01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:35.879
I'm free!

01:51:42.553 --> 01:51:44.430
He moved, he's alive!

01:51:48.934 --> 01:51:50.644
You broke Calcifer's spell!

01:52:05.701 --> 01:52:06.493
Turnip!

01:52:19.757 --> 01:52:21.091
Turnip, are you Ok?

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:23.052
I'll get you a new stick, right away.

01:52:25.846 --> 01:52:27.765
Thank you, Turnip.

01:52:35.814 --> 01:52:37.232
Thank you, Sophie.

01:52:38.484 --> 01:52:40.652
I'm a prince from the next kingdom.

01:52:40.861 --> 01:52:42.863
A cruel spell turned me
into a scarecrow.

01:52:43.238 --> 01:52:46.408
A spell that only your beloved's
kiss could break.

01:52:46.617 --> 01:52:48.994
Exactly.
And if Sophie hadn't saved me,

01:52:49.203 --> 01:52:51.121
I would have died.

01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:53.832
My, you're good-looking.

01:52:54.041 --> 01:52:56.668
What a racket!
What's the fuss?

01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:59.880
I feel terrible.
Like I'm trapped under a stone.

01:53:00.422 --> 01:53:02.633
Oh, yes, a heart's a heavy burden.

01:53:03.175 --> 01:53:06.553
Oh, Sophie, your hair is
just like starlight.

01:53:07.095 --> 01:53:08.096
It's so beautiful.

01:53:08.305 --> 01:53:10.557
I love you, Howl!
How wonderful!

01:53:12.976 --> 01:53:15.312
So, now you see how Sophie feels.

01:53:15.521 --> 01:53:19.483
You'd best go home and
make them stop this war.

01:53:19.691 --> 01:53:20.901
That's exactly what I shall do.

01:53:21.610 --> 01:53:24.571
When the war is over, I shall return.

01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:27.157
"A fickle heart is the only constant
in this world."

01:53:27.991 --> 01:53:30.077
My, you have a way with words

01:53:30.285 --> 01:53:32.579
I'll wait for your return, then

01:53:39.628 --> 01:53:43.090
Why should you
contact me now?

01:53:43.298 --> 01:53:45.092
What on earth have you been up to?

01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:50.639
A happy ending, I see.

01:53:50.889 --> 01:53:52.516
You two-timer.

01:53:59.398 --> 01:54:01.233
Well, there it is.

01:54:01.650 --> 01:54:05.112
Bring the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Defense.

01:54:05.862 --> 01:54:09.366
Let's put an end to this foolish war.

01:54:10.325 --> 01:54:11.785
It's Calcifer!

01:54:12.661 --> 01:54:14.830
You didn't have to come back.

01:54:17.666 --> 01:54:21.003
I really missed you all.
Besides, it looks like rain...

01:54:21.211 --> 01:54:23.213
Thank you, Calcifer.

01:54:39.062 --> 01:54:44.484
<i>Though we slipped apart</i>

01:54:46.069 --> 01:54:51.325
<i>Like sunlight through the leaves</i>

01:54:52.743 --> 01:54:58.165
<i>The promise of love</i>

01:54:59.458 --> 01:55:04.171
<i>Will live on eternally</i>

01:55:06.089 --> 01:55:12.346
<i>Even though I'm alone now</i>

01:55:12.721 --> 01:55:18.268
<i>My tomorrows are boundless</i>

01:55:19.311 --> 01:55:25.525
<i>Like the kindness you showed me</i>

01:55:26.026 --> 01:55:34.534
<i>Hidden in the night</i>

01:55:35.368 --> 01:55:41.208
<i>Somehow I lost you</i>

01:55:42.167 --> 01:55:47.506
<i>Among all my memories</i>

01:55:48.757 --> 01:55:54.554
<i>In a brook's gentle laughter</i>

01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:59.684
<i>In the scent of a flower</i>

01:55:59.893 --> 01:56:04.106
<i>In the depth of the sky</i>

01:56:04.898 --> 01:56:12.656
<i>You will live on eternally</i>
