Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!

04:22.335 --> 04:24.335
Kill him! Stomp on the son-of-a...

04:41.425 --> 04:44.835
Don't give them a chance!

04:46.385 --> 04:48.715
Hey! Where are you going?

05:54.635 --> 05:55.795
MacLeod!

06:01.005 --> 06:02.005
Fasil.

06:03.005 --> 06:03.875
Wait.

06:24.465 --> 06:25.795
All right.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.045
MacLeod!

11:47.885 --> 11:51.295
May this year of our Lord 1536

11:51.715 --> 11:54.625
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

11:55.045 --> 11:58.465
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

12:13.135 --> 12:17.795
- Are you scared, Connor?
- No, cousin Dougal, I'm not!

12:18.215 --> 12:20.045
Don't talk nonsense, man!

12:20.465 --> 12:23.875
I peed my kilt the first
time I went into battle!

12:24.295 --> 12:28.125
Oh, aye.
Angus pees his kilt all the time.

12:48.505 --> 12:51.755
Connor! Connor!

12:53.255 --> 12:55.715
Connow, wait! Wait!

12:56.545 --> 12:59.045
Take these flowers and think of me.

13:02.235 --> 13:05.085
Remember, you fight
with God on your side, Connor.

13:05.505 --> 13:09.465
A girl like that can wound a soldier
more than a Fraser's sword, my friend.

13:09.515 --> 13:12.125
Wait! Angus, you and Dugal keep him
in one piece, do you hear?

13:12.545 --> 13:15.295
Aye, we all know which piece that is!

13:59.675 --> 14:02.417
There is one called
Connor among them.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.875
Aye.

14:09.045 --> 14:12.505
Remember our agreement, Murdoch.

14:12.925 --> 14:15.175
The boy is mine.

14:15.585 --> 14:17.925
It's begun.

14:18.335 --> 14:20.465
Death to the MacLeods!

14:20.505 --> 14:23.380
<i>Death to the Macleods!</i>

14:32.122 --> 14:33.995
<i>Death to the Frazers!</i>

14:55.925 --> 14:57.375
MacLeod!

15:13.465 --> 15:14.425
Come on!

15:14.795 --> 15:16.295
Macleod!

15:20.715 --> 15:22.335
Stay under!

15:23.835 --> 15:25.335
Forgive me,

15:25.755 --> 15:27.425
my son.

15:29.005 --> 15:30.545
Fight me, damn you!

15:30.965 --> 15:32.215
No, that's Connor MacLeod!

15:32.265 --> 15:33.185
Fight me, you cowards!

15:33.235 --> 15:34.247
No, not him!

15:42.295 --> 15:43.875
Castrate the heathens!

15:44.335 --> 15:46.125
Nobody will fight me!

15:47.755 --> 15:48.715
They all run away.

15:49.795 --> 15:51.215
Here, laddie, stay by me.

15:59.045 --> 16:00.375
Mother of God!

16:05.385 --> 16:06.875
Fight me!

16:20.295 --> 16:21.755
No!

16:23.425 --> 16:24.465
Come on, quick!

16:24.885 --> 16:26.755
There can be only one!

16:30.545 --> 16:31.875
Another time, MacLeod!

17:06.835 --> 17:09.835
- Get out of the car!
- Put your hands on the hood!

17:12.714 --> 17:14.704
- Move!
- Okay!

17:17.675 --> 17:19.675
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it! Watch him!

17:19.776 --> 17:21.135
Watch him, watch him!

17:21.435 --> 17:22.685
Move!

17:22.731 --> 17:24.469
Come on, come on, come on!
Move!

17:24.652 --> 17:27.135
Come on, come on!

17:29.175 --> 17:31.335
Spread them! Spread them! Come on!

17:32.425 --> 17:34.005
See some ID, pal!

17:37.465 --> 17:42.875
Well, Mr. Nash! Where were
you going in such a hurry?

17:44.755 --> 17:46.875
Give me it! Give me it! Give me it!

17:53.215 --> 17:55.505
Don't move, pal.

17:55.925 --> 17:58.175
Don't even breathe.

18:46.005 --> 18:49.125
- It is over.
- No!

18:49.675 --> 18:53.875
Other men are dying this day.
I must attend them.

18:55.385 --> 18:56.505
Quiet!

19:03.465 --> 19:04.965
He's a Highlander, by God!

19:05.385 --> 19:09.295
The last thing to hear should not be
that of a wailing woman!

19:34.425 --> 19:36.255
Hey, come on. Let me through.

19:36.715 --> 19:41.845
Damn it, Frank. Forensics are supposed
to be notified the same time as homicide!

19:42.465 --> 19:43.505
Holy shit!

19:44.005 --> 19:46.965
- Yeah, this one came unassembled.
- Did you made an arrest?

19:47.335 --> 19:52.505
No. We're questioning some guy named Nash.
Antique dealer down on Hudson Street.

19:52.965 --> 19:55.005
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi, Walt.

19:55.965 --> 19:57.505
You look pretty, Brenda.

19:57.885 --> 20:00.875
What do you think of the
cause of death, Lieutenant, huh?

20:01.965 --> 20:04.295
Oh, Christ!
You're a barrel of laughs, Garfield.

20:04.675 --> 20:06.235
Get your hands off!

20:06.675 --> 20:09.335
Hey, cop! When are you going to explain?
This was my wife's, man!

20:09.755 --> 20:12.635
Hey, Walker, get me a
cherry-cheese Danish toast, please!

20:12.755 --> 20:15.335
What did they say?
What time did he buy it?

20:15.435 --> 20:17.125
Oh! About 10:00, 10:30.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.215
Whatever made the cut was razor sharp.

20:19.435 --> 20:23.335
Get out! I told you, you get
out of here with these cameras!

20:23.485 --> 20:25.435
Frank! Frank!

20:25.505 --> 20:27.295
- Oh, my God!
- About two days ago, the telefax

20:27.415 --> 20:30.435
told that a guy was killed
just like this over in Jersey.

20:30.535 --> 20:33.085
Yeah, but I figured
what the hell, that's Jersey!

20:33.235 --> 20:35.635
<i>Hey, coppers, I want to get out of here!</i>

20:35.755 --> 20:38.175
Hey Frank, come here!

20:40.005 --> 20:41.545
Oh, shit!

20:43.715 --> 20:46.175
Oh, baby, look at you!

20:47.215 --> 20:49.545
Garfield, cover that head.

20:55.255 --> 20:59.005
- What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

20:59.425 --> 21:03.625
- A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

21:04.675 --> 21:07.925
- Well, is it worth much?
- Only about a million bucks.

21:10.295 --> 21:14.625
Any antique dealer on
Hudson Street could tell you that.

21:16.579 --> 21:21.534
<i>You can't keep me here,
asshole! I know my rights!</i>

21:50.755 --> 21:53.755
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

21:54.835 --> 21:57.135
The name's Vazilek. Polish national.

21:57.175 --> 22:00.375
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

22:00.795 --> 22:02.903
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

22:03.125 --> 22:04.395
Not if I can help it.

22:04.515 --> 22:06.345
You talk funny, Nash.
Where're you from?

22:06.663 --> 22:08.275
Lots of different places.

22:08.715 --> 22:11.295
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hm.

22:11.715 --> 22:13.925
Okay. What's that?

22:19.335 --> 22:22.125
- A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

22:24.335 --> 22:28.285
That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million dollars.

22:28.335 --> 22:29.255
So?

22:29.675 --> 22:32.135
- So, you want to hear a theory?
- Mm-hm.

22:32.185 --> 22:34.965
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.545
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.435
Okay. His name is Iman Fasil.

22:40.475 --> 22:42.585
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

22:44.385 --> 22:46.585
Want to hear another theory?

22:47.005 --> 22:50.875
This Fasil was so upset
about the lousy wrestling tonight,

22:51.295 --> 22:55.375
he went down to the garage and in
a fit of depression cut off his own head.

22:56.865 --> 22:58.495
That's not funny, Walt.

22:59.135 --> 23:00.455
You a faggot, Nash?

23:00.535 --> 23:03.255
Why Garfield?
You're cruising for a piece of ass?

23:05.505 --> 23:07.545
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.

23:07.965 --> 23:10.635
You went down to
the garage for a blow job.

23:10.835 --> 23:12.295
You just didn't want to pay for it.

23:13.045 --> 23:15.255
Huh. You are sick.

23:16.592 --> 23:17.924
Hey! Hey!

23:18.007 --> 23:19.305
Hey, what are you doing?

23:20.288 --> 23:21.554
Stop! Stop it!

23:21.637 --> 23:24.293
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

23:24.377 --> 23:27.690
That's enough!
That's it! Now, cut it out!

23:27.773 --> 23:30.496
Goddamn it, I said cut it out!

23:32.085 --> 23:34.335
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

23:34.755 --> 23:38.585
- Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

23:41.835 --> 23:43.875
<i>...garage and water from the sprinkler.</i>

23:44.295 --> 23:47.835
<i>It also left a man's decapitated body</i>

23:47.935 --> 23:51.335
<i>lying on the floor next
to his own severed head.</i>

23:51.535 --> 23:54.435
<i>A head which at this time has no name.</i>

- Got a present for you from the coroner.
- Yeah, what's that?

26:26.135 --> 26:29.045
Pieces of metal. Found them
on the dead guy under the Garden.

26:29.835 --> 26:31.875

What did you say?

29:03.505 --> 29:05.795
Madison Square Garden.

29:08.175 --> 29:09.755
Do you go there often?

29:10.175 --> 29:11.255
Why?

29:12.835 --> 29:14.335
Basketball,

29:14.755 --> 29:16.505

29:17.215 --> 29:19.835

32:22.735 --> 32:24.635
He called you Highlander.
What did he mean?

32:24.735 --> 32:25.935
"There can only be one." Only one what?

32:25.985 --> 32:27.035
Listen, lady, you almost...

32:27.085 --> 32:29.635
- I want to know...
- Shut up!

32:30.835 --> 32:32.875
Don't you ever follow me again.

You only have one life.
If you value it...

32:36.925 --> 32:38.675
go home.

32:51.545 --> 32:53.625
You saw the wound, Angus.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.625
- He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

33:19.465 --> 33:21.085
Drinking with us, are you?

33:21.505 --> 33:25.125

- You, talking and breathing.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.255

How did you manage that, Connor Mcloed?

33:41.835 --> 33:45.965
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

33:47.135 --> 33:49.125
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

33:49.885 --> 33:54.965
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman.
I don't know who you are.

34:01.465 --> 34:03.835
- Angus.
- You'd better go, Connor.

34:06.635 --> 34:08.715
I'm not going anywhere.

34:09.225 --> 34:10.965
He's the devil! Kill him!

34:34.085 --> 34:36.135
- Dougal!
- Leave him be!

34:36.708 --> 34:37.657
Dougal...

34:37.795 --> 34:39.295
Go on, kill him!

34:40.965 --> 34:42.795
He's your cousin, man!

34:51.635 --> 34:52.925
No, Angus!

34:54.175 --> 34:56.005
Quiet! Quiet!

34:57.545 --> 34:59.835
There'll be no burning here today.

35:00.385 --> 35:02.045
We'll banish him.

35:02.465 --> 35:05.045
No! Burn him!

35:09.385 --> 35:10.795
Burn him!

35:11.215 --> 35:14.085
- Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

35:14.465 --> 35:16.795
Then go, while you still can!

35:18.385 --> 35:20.965
I'll not forget you, Angus.

37:29.835 --> 37:31.465
That's a good dog.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.755
- Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Aye.

37:42.875 --> 37:44.545
Right now!

37:46.635 --> 37:49.085
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

37:49.505 --> 37:52.965
Aye, blossom. The way you like it.

38:14.505 --> 38:18.295
You can do that to me
forever, if you like, my Lord.

38:21.175 --> 38:24.795
- Will you, Connor?
- Aye, blossom. I will.

38:31.545 --> 38:32.585
Hello!

38:38.795 --> 38:40.005
Greetings.

38:41.355 --> 38:44.625
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

38:45.045 --> 38:47.925
chief metallurgist to
King Charles V of Spain,

38:48.335 --> 38:50.335
and I'm at your service.

38:51.215 --> 38:52.255
Who?

38:57.255 --> 38:59.965
- What do you want?
- You.

39:03.335 --> 39:05.135
You're Connor MacLeod.

39:05.335 --> 39:07.005
- Maybe I am...
- You're Connor MacLeod,

39:07.425 --> 39:09.135
wounded in battle

39:09.635 --> 39:11.485
and driven from
your village of Glenfinnan

39:11.785 --> 39:13.295
five years ago.

39:14.135 --> 39:14.965
Connor!

39:16.635 --> 39:19.135
Heather, go in the house.

39:19.235 --> 39:20.305
I'll stay right here.

39:20.425 --> 39:22.375
Do as I say, woman!

39:36.585 --> 39:38.545
The sensation you're feeling

39:39.505 --> 39:41.425
is the Quickening.

39:43.715 --> 39:47.295
- Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

39:48.465 --> 39:50.795
We are brothers!

39:57.715 --> 40:00.505
I knew you guys were bottle-fed.

40:02.545 --> 40:05.755
Yeah, well, there's not a hell of a lot
I can do about it, pal.

40:06.295 --> 40:07.875
You see what I'm up against!

40:08.295 --> 40:11.255
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

40:12.795 --> 40:14.435
That's confidential.

40:14.835 --> 40:17.755
- How are things over at forensics?
- Dull.

40:18.175 --> 40:22.035
- How about some lunch?
- Lunch? It's a good idea. Who pays?

40:22.135 --> 40:24.125
- Me.
- You're on.

40:24.545 --> 40:26.135
- Oh, by the way, Frank.
- Yeah.

40:26.185 --> 40:27.935
- The hairs in the Moretti case?
- Uh-huh.

40:27.985 --> 40:30.135
- They matched up.
- What did I tell you?

40:30.635 --> 40:32.125
Oh! I forgot my purse.

40:32.675 --> 40:34.215
I'll meet you outside.

40:35.175 --> 40:37.965
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

41:23.085 --> 41:26.965

41:49.335 --> 41:51.665
Haggis? What is haggis?

41:51.885 --> 41:54.085
A sheep's stomach
stuffed with meat and barley.

41:55.675 --> 41:58.505
- And what do you do with it?
- You eat it!

41:59.135 --> 42:00.715

42:08.505 --> 42:10.335

42:10.385 --> 42:11.935
You said you were from Spain.

42:11.985 --> 42:13.085
You are a liar!

42:14.545 --> 42:18.675
You have the manners of a goat,
and you smell like a dungheap,

42:19.085 --> 42:23.425
and you've no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential. Now!

42:24.335 --> 42:26.295
- Get out!
- No!

42:27.755 --> 42:31.735
Help! Help! Help!

42:33.935 --> 42:35.135

42:35.635 --> 42:38.625

- You can't drown, you fool!

42:39.045 --> 42:40.675

I'm going to slice you in half.

43:51.635 --> 43:56.295
Crude and slow, clansman. Your attack
was no better than that of a clumsy child.

44:04.635 --> 44:06.255
This cannot be.

44:07.085 --> 44:08.585
It's the devil's work.

44:11.925 --> 44:15.715
You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept it.

44:20.755 --> 44:22.755
- I hate you.
- Good.

44:23.175 --> 44:25.375
That is a perfect way to start.

44:27.425 --> 44:30.465
Tell me, how did it
happen for God's sake?

44:33.835 --> 44:36.425
Why does the sun come up? Hmm?

44:37.465 --> 44:42.505
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night? Who knows?

44:43.545 --> 44:47.465
What I do know is that
because you were born different,

44:47.885 --> 44:51.255
men will fear you, try to drive you away,

44:51.675 --> 44:53.545
like the people of your village.

45:04.675 --> 45:07.965
You must learn
to conceal your special gift

45:08.385 --> 45:10.505
and harness your power

45:10.925 --> 45:13.505
until the time of the Gathering.

45:16.465 --> 45:18.005
What Gathering?

45:18.675 --> 45:20.375
When only a few of us are left,

45:20.795 --> 45:25.875
we will feel an irresistible
pull towards a faraway land

45:26.295 --> 45:28.835
to fight for the prize.

45:31.635 --> 45:32.795
Come on!

45:34.085 --> 45:35.295
Faster!

45:44.835 --> 45:46.925
Never lose your temper.

45:48.755 --> 45:51.925
If your head comes
away from your neck, it's over.

46:18.005 --> 46:19.835
Never overextend your thrust.

46:20.465 --> 46:24.255
You're vulnerable and off balance.

46:24.715 --> 46:26.335
Connor!

46:28.135 --> 46:29.875
Heather, please!

46:42.635 --> 46:47.215
If it came down to just us two,
would you take my head?

46:53.005 --> 46:56.255
We must fight until only one remains.

46:56.675 --> 47:01.085
You're safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.

47:01.505 --> 47:03.215
It's tradition.

47:16.255 --> 47:18.425
Now for the last.

47:19.465 --> 47:21.005
Trust me.

47:24.175 --> 47:26.675
Let yourself feel the stag.

47:29.965 --> 47:33.255
His heart... beating,

47:40.585 --> 47:42.125
his blood...

47:42.545 --> 47:43.585
coursing.

47:43.965 --> 47:45.625
Feel?

47:47.005 --> 47:49.255
- Come on!
- I feel him.

47:51.335 --> 47:54.135
MacLeod, come on!

47:54.715 --> 47:57.255
- I feel him!
- Come on!

48:00.385 --> 48:02.545
I feel him!

48:06.835 --> 48:09.085
Come on, Haggis!

48:17.635 --> 48:20.135
- Yeah!
- Yes!

48:53.425 --> 48:58.755
Now, Pendejo, shall we see
what sort of swordsman you've become?

48:59.175 --> 49:00.585
En garde!

49:09.175 --> 49:10.085
Very good.

49:29.135 --> 49:31.215
Give me your hand, brother.

49:48.135 --> 49:51.125
That one there. How much is it?

50:08.925 --> 50:10.215
Put him in.

50:10.835 --> 50:12.465
But what I want is a family.

50:12.885 --> 50:16.675
You cannot have a family.
We cannot have children.

50:19.005 --> 50:22.375
That won't please Heather.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

50:24.425 --> 50:26.545
He's full of life.

50:28.585 --> 50:29.625
Connor!

50:32.635 --> 50:34.545
Here's dinner.

50:36.545 --> 50:39.755
I'll be off now.
I fancy buying myself a new dress.

50:43.585 --> 50:46.425
Oh, you little devils. Go on!

50:48.925 --> 50:50.675
She is beautiful.

50:52.465 --> 50:54.755
You must leave her, brother.

51:06.385 --> 51:07.505
MacLeod,

51:08.715 --> 51:11.835
I was born 2,437 years ago.

51:12.885 --> 51:15.215
In that time I've had 3 wives.

51:15.635 --> 51:18.545
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

51:18.965 --> 51:23.585
Her father, Masamune,
a genius, made this for me.

51:24.635 --> 51:26.965
In 593 B.C.

51:28.635 --> 51:30.425
It is the only one of its kind,

51:32.295 --> 51:34.125
like his daughter.

51:35.635 --> 51:38.215
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

51:38.635 --> 51:40.795
I would save you that pain.

51:41.585 --> 51:43.925
Please, let Heather go.

52:02.545 --> 52:07.335
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

52:08.715 --> 52:11.975
That wasn't the first time
you felt that sensation, was it?

52:12.015 --> 52:13.035
No.

52:13.335 --> 52:17.215
When the MacLeods fought
the Frasers, and a black knight...

52:18.925 --> 52:20.185
I felt it then.

52:20.635 --> 52:22.545
Only it was different, more painful.

52:22.965 --> 52:28.125
That black knight was the Kurgan.
It's because of him that I sought you out.

52:30.675 --> 52:33.425
Who is the Kurgan?
And where does he come from?

52:33.835 --> 52:37.255
The Kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of Russia.

52:37.675 --> 52:43.045
For amusement they tossed children
into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

52:43.465 --> 52:47.585
The Kurgan.
He is the strongest of all the Immortals.

52:48.005 --> 52:50.715
He is the perfect warrior.

52:51.465 --> 52:56.255
If he wins the prize, mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness.

52:57.885 --> 52:59.835
How do you fight such a savage?

53:01.335 --> 53:04.795
With heart, faith and steel.

53:05.215 --> 53:08.125
In the end, there can be only one.

53:13.255 --> 53:15.435
It must have been very dangerous for you.

53:15.535 --> 53:18.295
Well, I was very much
in love with her, my dear Heather.

53:18.715 --> 53:21.925
She was the only
thing on my mind, not danger.

53:22.335 --> 53:26.215
So, holding the rose in my teeth,
I climbed up on the rooftop,

53:26.635 --> 53:30.835
lowered a rope and swung
in through the open window.

53:33.385 --> 53:36.980
Unfortunately,
the lady was no longer there.

53:37.065 --> 53:38.175
What did you do?

53:38.295 --> 53:41.505
I introduced myself
to the lady that was there.

53:41.925 --> 53:44.175
She was most helpful.

53:46.385 --> 53:48.425
Would you like some more wine?

53:48.835 --> 53:50.255
Yes, please.

54:02.675 --> 54:05.715
- Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

54:11.795 --> 54:12.545
Get out!

54:16.255 --> 54:17.505
Kurgan!

54:19.255 --> 54:20.715
Ramírez!

54:30.175 --> 54:33.715
The Highlander, where is he?

54:34.215 --> 54:36.654
You're too late.
I've prepared him for you.

54:36.695 --> 54:38.675
You waste your time!

55:05.835 --> 55:06.715
It hurts?

55:20.675 --> 55:22.505
Now you die!

55:28.005 --> 55:30.835
You cannot win,
Ramírez. I'm the strongest!

55:31.215 --> 55:33.175
My cut has improved your voice.

57:15.385 --> 57:16.585
Yes!

57:49.335 --> 57:50.755
Hurts?

57:54.835 --> 57:56.715
Who is the woman?

57:59.385 --> 58:00.925
She's mine.

58:01.925 --> 58:04.215
Not for much longer.

58:14.085 --> 58:16.675
Tonight you sleep in hell.

58:17.465 --> 58:19.425
There can be only one!

59:06.675 --> 59:08.835
Hello, pretty!

59:19.885 --> 59:21.435
I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.

59:21.885 --> 59:24.295
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Nash
isn't here at the moment.

59:24.715 --> 59:26.835
May I call him at home?
I have to talk to him today.

59:27.135 --> 59:29.335
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

59:30.215 --> 59:34.425
- Good morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

59:35.755 --> 59:39.505
We've already met, Rachel.
What can I do for you?

59:39.925 --> 59:41.425
I'd like some advice.

59:41.925 --> 59:44.435
Are you the kind of woman
who takes advice?

59:44.835 --> 59:47.545
- That depends.
- Advice about what?

59:48.425 --> 59:51.335
What can you tell me about a 7" lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword

59:51.375 --> 59:54.525
at 1 o'clock in the morning
in New York city, 1985?

59:57.465 --> 59:58.335
Not much.

59:58.755 --> 01:00:01.535
What about a Japanese
sword dated 600 B.C.? 375

01:00:01.735 --> 01:00:04.235
The metal in the blade folded 200 times.

01:00:04.925 --> 01:00:07.005
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

01:00:07.635 --> 01:00:10.715
Can I show you something
in 18th century silver?

01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:14.465
That's not why I came here,
and you know it.

01:00:15.635 --> 01:00:18.335
- Do you cook?
- Why?

01:00:18.835 --> 01:00:21.005
I thought we might have dinner.

01:00:21.545 --> 01:00:23.055
- Did you?
- Yes.

01:00:26.215 --> 01:00:29.166
So, I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda!

01:00:29.215 --> 01:00:31.715
Our little Brenda.

01:00:32.135 --> 01:00:34.005
You're sure it was Brenda?

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.965
She was in Nash's shop.
She was talking to him.

01:00:46.505 --> 01:00:51.125
- What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

01:00:53.135 --> 01:00:57.715
People are asking about you.
What am I supposed to say?

01:01:00.255 --> 01:01:02.585
Tell them I'm Immortal.

01:01:02.885 --> 01:01:05.795
Attention! Four men over here!

01:01:38.385 --> 01:01:40.175
Quiet.

01:01:46.005 --> 01:01:47.375
Don't be afraid.

01:01:47.925 --> 01:01:50.005
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

01:01:50.425 --> 01:01:53.715
- What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.335
I'm like you. I'm alone.

01:01:59.755 --> 01:02:01.715
Come with me, Rachel.

01:02:16.175 --> 01:02:21.925
- You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- Hey, it's a kind of magic.

01:02:26.255 --> 01:02:28.335
- You should be dead!
- Move!

01:02:28.885 --> 01:02:31.505
No! You'll have to shoot me first.

01:02:32.385 --> 01:02:35.885
Whatever you say, Jack.
You're the master race.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:41.675
Let's go.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.505
That was a long time ago.

01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:49.255
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

01:02:50.465 --> 01:02:54.335
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.

01:02:54.755 --> 01:02:58.045
- What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

01:02:58.635 --> 01:03:00.715
I'm not lonely.

01:03:01.335 --> 01:03:05.295
- I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:10.215
You refuse to let anyone love you.

01:03:11.255 --> 01:03:12.875
Love is for poets.

01:03:17.505 --> 01:03:20.125
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

01:03:21.255 --> 01:03:23.175
You always were.

01:03:45.635 --> 01:03:47.255
Just a minute!

01:04:06.465 --> 01:04:07.625
Good evening.

01:04:12.835 --> 01:04:16.175
Do you want to dine in the hall,
or shall we step inside?

01:04:18.635 --> 01:04:20.425
Come in.

01:04:22.045 --> 01:04:23.335
May I take your coat?

01:04:23.385 --> 01:04:24.665
- No thanks.
- What?

01:04:24.885 --> 01:04:27.755
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

01:04:32.215 --> 01:04:34.835
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:38.795
Make yourself a drink.
There are glasses in the bar.

01:04:51.215 --> 01:04:52.925
Do you know what you're doing?

01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:16.375
I like your place, Brenda.

01:05:16.795 --> 01:05:20.625
I've only been here 3 months.
I'm still cleaning it up.

01:05:25.085 --> 01:05:28.255
- Interesting view.
- What did you say?

01:05:33.925 --> 01:05:36.375
I said, "interesting view".

01:05:36.965 --> 01:05:38.125
Isn't it great?

01:05:45.505 --> 01:05:48.675
You never told me
what you do for a living.

01:05:49.635 --> 01:05:53.215
I work for the Metropolitan Museum.

01:05:55.045 --> 01:05:56.505
In Aquisitions.

01:05:59.465 --> 01:06:02.125
That explains your
interest in ancient weapons.

01:06:04.085 --> 01:06:05.215
Right.

01:06:07.175 --> 01:06:09.255
Especially the Samurai.

01:06:10.545 --> 01:06:11.875
Very nice.

01:06:12.795 --> 01:06:15.755
- Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

01:06:21.045 --> 01:06:22.295
Brandy.

01:06:23.335 --> 01:06:25.715
Bottled in 1783.

01:06:26.135 --> 01:06:27.835
Wow! That's old.

01:06:30.755 --> 01:06:33.295
1783 was a very good year.

01:06:35.635 --> 01:06:38.215
Mozart wrote his Great Mass.

01:06:39.925 --> 01:06:44.255
The Montgolfier Brothers
went up in their first balloon.

01:06:48.215 --> 01:06:52.335
And England recognized
the independence of the United States.

01:06:52.755 --> 01:06:54.125
Is that right?

01:06:55.175 --> 01:06:56.085
Yes.

01:07:03.755 --> 01:07:05.375
What's that?

01:07:06.545 --> 01:07:09.235
- It's for you.
- Can I open it?

01:07:09.335 --> 01:07:10.585
If you like.

01:07:25.295 --> 01:07:27.585
You bastard! Where did you find this?

01:07:28.005 --> 01:07:30.625
I have an extensive library.

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:35.545
Odd thing,
your bio doesn't mention the Met.

01:07:35.965 --> 01:07:39.835
It says you work
for the police. In forensics.

01:07:40.255 --> 01:07:44.045
- Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

01:07:44.465 --> 01:07:48.965
Then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment?

01:07:50.585 --> 01:07:52.875
You remember him.
Moran's had him tailing me.

01:07:53.295 --> 01:07:54.925
What're you gonna do?

01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:57.935
The question is what are you gonna do?

01:07:58.135 --> 01:08:01.005
You're going to turn off the tape
or you're going to shoot me with the .45?

01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:08.199
I am not looking for a killer.
I am looking for a sword,

01:08:08.210 --> 01:08:10.835
the one used on Fasil.
I found pieces of it under the Garden.

01:08:10.935 --> 01:08:12.675
- I only want to see the Samurai.
- Why?

01:08:13.085 --> 01:08:15.435
I told you!
Because it's not supposed to exist!

01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:20.135
I dated pieces of the blade at 600 B.C.
The metal had been folded 200 times.

01:08:20.185 --> 01:08:22.375
The Japanese didn't start making
swords like that till the Middle Ages.

01:08:22.795 --> 01:08:25.085
So where the hell did it come from?

01:08:25.505 --> 01:08:28.535
If I could verify the existence
of such a weapon, it would be like...

01:08:28.935 --> 01:08:33.005
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

01:08:34.085 --> 01:08:35.425
This is crazy.

01:08:35.835 --> 01:08:39.295
Wait a minute, Nash,
I want some answers.

01:08:40.335 --> 01:08:41.925
You want?

01:08:42.925 --> 01:08:45.925
Don't you ever think about
anything except what you want?

01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:03.255

My husband.

01:11:14.385 --> 01:11:16.505
I am that, my love.

01:11:20.585 --> 01:11:23.005
I've never really known...

01:11:24.175 --> 01:11:25.295
What?

01:11:26.965 --> 01:11:29.005
Why you stayed.

01:11:31.255 --> 01:11:34.875
Because I love you as much now
as the first day we met.

01:11:37.925 --> 01:11:39.675
And I love you.

01:11:44.425 --> 01:11:46.125
I don't want to die.

01:11:47.295 --> 01:11:49.215
I want to stay with you.

01:11:49.635 --> 01:11:51.045
Forever.

01:11:51.465 --> 01:11:53.125
I want that, too.

01:11:54.635 --> 01:11:57.215
Will you do something for me, Connor?

01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:01.375
What, blossom?

01:12:02.505 --> 01:12:04.377
In the years to come,

01:12:04.425 --> 01:12:08.245
will you light a candle
and remember me on my birthday?

01:12:09.385 --> 01:12:10.835
Aye, love.

01:12:11.255 --> 01:12:12.755
I will.

01:12:13.675 --> 01:12:16.125
I wanted to have your children.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:20.625
They would have been strong and fine.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:27.715
Don't see me, Connor.

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.375
Let me die in peace.

01:12:33.005 --> 01:12:34.465
Where are we?

01:12:41.795 --> 01:12:43.835
We're in the Highlands.

01:12:46.715 --> 01:12:47.965
Where else?

01:12:51.675 --> 01:12:54.175
Running down a mountain side.

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:09.875
The sun is shining.

01:13:11.675 --> 01:13:13.255
It's not cold.

01:13:15.255 --> 01:13:17.835
You've got your sheepskins on.

01:13:21.675 --> 01:13:24.795
And the boots I made for you.

01:13:27.885 --> 01:13:30.125
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

01:13:45.465 --> 01:13:47.425
Hey, Kastagir!

01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:53.175
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

01:13:53.585 --> 01:13:55.755
It seems like a hundred years.

01:13:56.175 --> 01:13:57.835
It's been a hundred years.

01:14:06.215 --> 01:14:07.795
How've you been?

01:14:09.135 --> 01:14:10.135
Hey!

01:14:10.585 --> 01:14:11.535
This...

01:14:13.045 --> 01:14:15.215
...puts hairs on your chest.

01:14:18.255 --> 01:14:20.715
- What is it?
- Boom-boom!

01:14:21.795 --> 01:14:25.085
A big strong man like you shouldn't
be afraid of a little boom-boom!

01:14:25.465 --> 01:14:27.853
Or maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you?

01:14:27.865 --> 01:14:30.847
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:34.925
So, the Gathering is here.

01:14:37.965 --> 01:14:40.280
Time has almost
caught us, my friend.

01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:42.755
Has it?
You think we should go on?

01:14:45.215 --> 01:14:47.175
I think we should have a party.

01:14:47.585 --> 01:14:50.835
Oh no! I remember
the last time we had a party.

01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:52.835
Really, when exactly was that?

01:14:53.255 --> 01:14:54.965
It was 1783.

01:14:55.385 --> 01:14:57.705
1783...

01:14:58.295 --> 01:15:02.085
Oh yes! Your famous
duel on Boston Common.

01:15:03.295 --> 01:15:04.425
You were drunk.

01:15:04.495 --> 01:15:07.495
- What was that guy's name again?
- His name was Bassett.

01:15:07.545 --> 01:15:10.085
The heavier blade,
Mr. Bassett! I implore you!

01:15:10.135 --> 01:15:12.085
I am fighting the duel,
Hotchkiss, not you!

01:15:14.085 --> 01:15:15.875
See if the imbecile is ready.

01:15:16.675 --> 01:15:20.375
- Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

01:15:20.835 --> 01:15:22.835
Christ, I've gone blind!

01:15:23.635 --> 01:15:25.295
En garde, Sir!

01:15:29.675 --> 01:15:33.085
- Wonderful, Sir.
- Thank you, Hotchkiss.

01:15:34.005 --> 01:15:37.125
Bassett, is that you?

01:15:37.585 --> 01:15:39.335
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

01:16:00.675 --> 01:16:01.585
Stop, Sir!

01:16:02.005 --> 01:16:03.505
I beseech...

01:16:03.925 --> 01:16:08.145
I apologize for calling
your wife a bloated warthog.

01:16:09.675 --> 01:16:11.965
And I bid you a good day.

01:16:14.635 --> 01:16:16.235
- Shoot him, Sir?
- What?

01:16:16.285 --> 01:16:18.375
Shoot him. Now, Sir. Now, Sir.
In the back of the head. Now, Sir!

01:16:18.795 --> 01:16:21.795
Hotchkiss! Hotchkiss, stop it!

01:16:23.505 --> 01:16:25.925
- Hotchkiss...
- Sir?

01:16:26.335 --> 01:16:27.875
No, Sir.

01:16:36.425 --> 01:16:38.335
<i>That's the mood
of New York at this moment.</i>

01:16:38.755 --> 01:16:42.175
<i>- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- An angry city in the grip of fear.</i>

01:16:49.051 --> 01:16:51.565
<i>Earlier today,
in response to growing pressure,</i>

01:16:51.606 --> 01:16:54.062
<i>the mayor's office
issued the following statement.</i>

01:16:54.135 --> 01:16:57.175
- Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

01:16:57.215 --> 01:16:59.357
<i>Police departments are
continuing the vigorous investigation</i>

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:02.295
<i>following up on a
number of promising leads.</i>

01:17:02.335 --> 01:17:03.425
Hey, Rockefeller.

01:17:03.835 --> 01:17:08.175
How'd you like Candy?
She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

01:17:10.135 --> 01:17:12.335
Don't ever speak to me.

01:17:18.335 --> 01:17:19.715
Look, I didn't mean...

01:17:21.835 --> 01:17:26.335
Don't ever speak to me again!

01:17:26.755 --> 01:17:28.505
Do you understand?

01:17:30.585 --> 01:17:32.215
Good.

01:17:37.005 --> 01:17:40.505
I hope you get your
head chopped off, asshole!

01:17:42.545 --> 01:17:45.425
And you! Shut it!

01:18:07.768 --> 01:18:10.307
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

01:18:18.925 --> 01:18:19.875
What the hell?

01:18:34.005 --> 01:18:36.465
Okay, Marine, this is for real.

01:18:42.285 --> 01:18:43.435
Let's go!

01:18:47.215 --> 01:18:49.335
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, come on!

01:19:01.925 --> 01:19:03.965
What the hell's going on?!

01:20:58.335 --> 01:20:59.375
For God's sake.

01:21:12.045 --> 01:21:13.425
Look at that!

01:21:51.675 --> 01:21:53.125
Mother of God...

01:21:57.585 --> 01:21:58.835
Mom!

01:22:04.005 --> 01:22:06.375
Hey, where're you going with my car?

01:22:06.795 --> 01:22:10.085
Daddy, help me! Daddy! Daddy, help me!

01:22:19.425 --> 01:22:21.135
Frank!
Will you take it easy?

01:22:21.185 --> 01:22:23.180
I'm telling you, I checked
everywhere with everybody.

01:22:23.275 --> 01:22:25.075
There just aren't any witnesses!

01:22:25.635 --> 01:22:27.055
That's New York for you!

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:29.625
Twenty people standing around,
nobody saw a goddamn thing.

01:22:30.045 --> 01:22:32.635
Tell me about this Matunas.
What is he, on drugs?

01:22:32.685 --> 01:22:33.505
He's a survival man.

01:22:33.545 --> 01:22:34.775
What do you
mean "survival man"?

01:22:34.790 --> 01:22:36.935
He's into guns.
He was a Marine in Vietnam.

01:22:36.985 --> 01:22:39.490
I talked to his ex-CO.
He said that the guy was a...

01:22:39.516 --> 01:22:41.625
...little paranoid,
but he was good a man.

01:22:43.795 --> 01:22:46.135
- How're you doing, kid?
- Okay, I guess.

01:22:46.185 --> 01:22:48.650
For a guy who had 3 feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:49.995
How're you doing old man?

01:22:50.635 --> 01:22:53.335
I understand you saw the
guy that stuck you, is that right?

01:22:53.755 --> 01:22:55.255
You're kidding me, man.

01:22:55.675 --> 01:22:57.415
Is that him?

01:22:57.715 --> 01:22:58.565
Nope.

01:22:59.885 --> 01:23:02.235
Come on, quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley!

01:23:02.285 --> 01:23:03.875
The freak was trying to kill me!

01:23:04.295 --> 01:23:08.428
I'll never forget his face.
He had a scar across his neck.

01:23:08.533 --> 01:23:09.525
That ain't him.

01:23:09.835 --> 01:23:10.965
Shit!

01:23:13.925 --> 01:23:15.965
- Depressed?
- Yeah.

01:23:17.385 --> 01:23:19.795
You don't know grunt about depressed.

01:23:20.115 --> 01:23:24.515
I got me a .357,
I got me a trunk load of shotguns,

01:23:24.535 --> 01:23:27.995
I got three big-bore rifles,
and ammo up the ass.

01:23:28.385 --> 01:23:31.335
And I ain't safe.
I can't protect myself!

01:23:31.425 --> 01:23:33.675
Okay, Take it easy, pal. Take it easy!

01:23:33.885 --> 01:23:36.675
That weirdo, man. He got up,

01:23:37.085 --> 01:23:41.255
after I'd put enough
lead in him to drop a rhino.

01:23:41.675 --> 01:23:44.915
Hey, listen, listen. You think you could
work with one of our artists,

01:23:44.965 --> 01:23:47.235
maybe come up
with a picture of this guy?

01:23:47.335 --> 01:23:49.675
Sure. Sure. Yes.

01:23:50.425 --> 01:23:52.295
Take it easy, pal.

01:23:53.425 --> 01:23:55.295
- Hey, cop!
- Yeah?

01:23:55.715 --> 01:23:57.755
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

01:23:59.175 --> 01:24:00.795
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

01:24:01.675 --> 01:24:04.255
After he threw me against the wall...

01:24:23.755 --> 01:24:25.835
- This is getting like "One Step Beyond".
- Yeah.

01:24:25.935 --> 01:24:28.205
Listen, when we get out there,
remember. All we've got is an eye-witness.

01:24:28.255 --> 01:24:30.635
Now, don't say anything
about swordfights in New York city,

01:24:30.685 --> 01:24:32.735
or guys glowing
in the dark, for Christ's sake.

01:24:34.135 --> 01:24:36.135
Hey, Moran!

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:38.505
Have you read what it says in here?

01:24:38.925 --> 01:24:42.005
Are you kidding,
Tony? You know cops can't read.

01:24:42.425 --> 01:24:44.875
What does "incompetent" mean?

01:24:46.335 --> 01:24:50.335
That mayor,
he calls me at 2 o'clock in the morning!

01:24:50.755 --> 01:24:53.005
I mean, I don't even
answer the phone anymore.

01:24:53.425 --> 01:24:56.175
What does "baffled" mean?

01:25:27.795 --> 01:25:30.795
Karen Joan Nash.

01:25:32.795 --> 01:25:34.675
Yeah, I remember this one.

01:25:35.085 --> 01:25:38.735
I was practicing in Syracuse.
Didn't get many of these.

01:25:38.885 --> 01:25:39.925
What?

01:25:40.335 --> 01:25:44.375
Unwed mothers.
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

01:25:45.675 --> 01:25:49.625
Back then in Syracuse,
that was a stoning offense.

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:52.045
What happened?

01:25:53.335 --> 01:25:56.755
- She had the baby and she died.
- So, Nash was illegitimate?

01:25:57.175 --> 01:26:00.335
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was illegitimate.

01:26:00.755 --> 01:26:04.295
For about a minute and a half.
He died right after she did.

01:26:08.755 --> 01:26:10.085
He died?

01:26:21.135 --> 01:26:22.545
Hello, Brenda.

01:26:23.175 --> 01:26:24.475
I did what you asked.

01:26:24.515 --> 01:26:27.745
I spent all night going through the old
deeds to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

01:26:27.795 --> 01:26:29.999
all the way back back
through the five previous owners

01:26:30.085 --> 01:26:32.875
to the original guy, Montague in 1796.

01:26:33.295 --> 01:26:36.465
In all five instances,
Montague through Nash,

01:26:36.885 --> 01:26:40.505
I found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth,

01:26:40.925 --> 01:26:44.585
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance.

01:26:45.635 --> 01:26:47.505
Jesus, Rick.
Isn't there any heat in here?

01:26:47.925 --> 01:26:49.925
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

01:26:50.335 --> 01:26:53.215
Now, just in case there's any doubt...

01:27:15.295 --> 01:27:16.985
So what you've got here, Brenda,

01:27:17.035 --> 01:27:20.125
is a guy who's been
creeping around since at least 1700,

01:27:20.545 --> 01:27:22.715
pretending to croak
every once in a while,

01:27:23.135 --> 01:27:26.925
leaving all these goods to kids
who've been corpses for years

01:27:27.295 --> 01:27:29.465
and assuming their identities.

01:27:35.045 --> 01:27:37.045
It's not possible.

01:27:39.295 --> 01:27:43.175
"Post" final!
Cops release Headhunter picture!

01:27:43.585 --> 01:27:45.135
- Reward offered!
- I'll take a "Post".

01:27:45.185 --> 01:27:47.005
- Me too.
- Headhunter revealed!

01:28:20.755 --> 01:28:23.005
For you, my bonny Heather.

01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:26.125
Happy birthday.

01:28:28.175 --> 01:28:30.295
And you, Juan Ramírez.

01:28:32.335 --> 01:28:34.875
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

01:29:12.175 --> 01:29:14.375
Kastagir is gone.

01:29:14.795 --> 01:29:17.125
Only you and I remain.

01:29:24.755 --> 01:29:27.665
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

01:29:28.175 --> 01:29:29.715
Who cuts your hair?

01:29:30.135 --> 01:29:32.835
I am in disguise.

01:29:34.255 --> 01:29:36.925
This way no one will recognize me.

01:29:39.635 --> 01:29:40.675
I do.

01:29:42.795 --> 01:29:45.215
- What do you want?
- Your head.

01:29:46.925 --> 01:29:48.545
And the prize.

01:29:50.835 --> 01:29:52.175
Watch.

01:29:52.885 --> 01:29:55.175
Happy Halloween, ladies!

01:30:04.675 --> 01:30:07.545
Nuns! No sense of humor.

01:30:08.585 --> 01:30:13.045
Ramírez's blade
did not cut deeply enough.

01:30:13.465 --> 01:30:15.635
He was right about you. You're slime.

01:30:15.755 --> 01:30:18.255
Ramírez was an effete snob!

01:30:18.675 --> 01:30:20.795
He died on his knees.

01:30:21.215 --> 01:30:26.755
I took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold.

01:30:35.755 --> 01:30:37.965
I see!

01:30:38.795 --> 01:30:40.675
Ramírez lied.

01:30:43.585 --> 01:30:45.755
She was not his woman.

01:30:46.795 --> 01:30:48.625
She was your woman.

01:30:49.335 --> 01:30:51.675
And she never told you.

01:30:52.795 --> 01:30:55.085
I wonder why.

01:30:55.505 --> 01:30:59.925
Perhaps I gave her
something you never could...

01:31:02.045 --> 01:31:06.375
and secretly she yearned for my return.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.795
Holy ground, Highlander!

01:31:09.215 --> 01:31:12.255
Remember what Ramírez taught you.

01:31:16.965 --> 01:31:19.545
You can't stay in here forever.

01:31:22.465 --> 01:31:24.465
You are weak, Highlander.

01:31:24.965 --> 01:31:30.375
You will always be weaker than I.

01:31:34.505 --> 01:31:36.215
I'll be out front.

01:31:40.795 --> 01:31:42.335
Goodbye, MacLeod.

01:31:42.755 --> 01:31:45.295
We will meet soon enough.

01:31:57.505 --> 01:31:59.585
This is the house of God.

01:32:00.005 --> 01:32:02.715
People are trying to pray.
You're disturbing them.

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:07.925
He cares about these helpless mortals?

01:32:09.135 --> 01:32:11.045
Of course he cares.

01:32:11.465 --> 01:32:13.465
He died for our sins.

01:32:13.885 --> 01:32:15.835
That shall be his undoing.

01:32:18.085 --> 01:32:19.085
Father,

01:32:20.295 --> 01:32:22.005
forgive me.

01:32:22.425 --> 01:32:24.925
I am a worm.

01:32:38.335 --> 01:32:40.715
I have something to say.

01:32:41.135 --> 01:32:44.545
It's better to burn out
than to fade away.

01:32:53.885 --> 01:32:55.635
I need to see him, goddamn it!

01:32:55.715 --> 01:32:58.715
I'm afraid that's
impossible. Mr. Nash is...

01:32:59.635 --> 01:33:02.255
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

01:33:04.835 --> 01:33:08.375
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a dead guy named Nash.

01:33:08.795 --> 01:33:11.035
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

01:33:17.135 --> 01:33:18.295
All right.

01:33:19.465 --> 01:33:20.835
Come on.

01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.375
Are the claymores real?

01:33:50.965 --> 01:33:55.215
What is this, a museum?
This stuff must be worth a fortune.

01:34:04.085 --> 01:34:07.455
I've been alive
for four and a half centuries.

01:34:07.675 --> 01:34:09.175
I cannot die.

01:34:11.925 --> 01:34:14.335
Well, everybody's got their problems.

01:34:21.045 --> 01:34:22.505
What are you going to do with that?

01:34:22.925 --> 01:34:24.465
Take it.

01:34:39.255 --> 01:34:42.175
I am Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.

01:34:42.925 --> 01:34:47.715
I was born in 1518 in the village of
Glennfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel.

01:34:49.965 --> 01:34:51.675
And I am immortal.

01:36:30.735 --> 01:36:32.135
You're not listening.

01:36:32.635 --> 01:36:36.295
Brenda, it isn't going to work.
I can't get involved, not again.

01:36:49.635 --> 01:36:51.875
You know what's weird?

01:36:52.295 --> 01:36:54.545
Most people are afraid to die.

01:36:54.965 --> 01:36:57.125
That's not your problem.

01:36:57.545 --> 01:36:59.835
You're afraid to live.

01:37:04.505 --> 01:37:06.425
Take care of yourself.

01:37:06.835 --> 01:37:08.755
Don't lose your head.

01:37:24.425 --> 01:37:26.295
Hello, pretty.

01:37:31.215 --> 01:37:32.125
Come on, open up!

01:37:41.255 --> 01:37:42.715
Mamma mia.

01:38:04.755 --> 01:38:06.255
You ever played chicken?

01:38:10.935 --> 01:38:12.935
Here we go!

01:38:15.335 --> 01:38:16.635
Watch out!

01:38:52.635 --> 01:38:53.935
Excuse me!

01:40:57.795 --> 01:40:59.875
The endless killing's driven him mad.

01:41:00.295 --> 01:41:03.135
Rachel, there are some
instructions in the desk drawer.

01:41:03.435 --> 01:41:04.675
I want you to follow them.

01:41:05.085 --> 01:41:09.465
There is a power of attorney for you.
You'll have everything you need.

01:41:10.505 --> 01:41:12.255
You're not coming back!

01:41:13.715 --> 01:41:17.755
Even if you kill him,
you're not coming back, are you?

01:41:27.295 --> 01:41:32.295
Sweet Rachel,
you always knew this would happen.

01:41:33.335 --> 01:41:35.545
Russell Nash dies tonight.

01:41:50.885 --> 01:41:53.755
Hey, it's a kind of magic.

01:42:03.175 --> 01:42:04.835
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

01:47:22.585 --> 01:47:24.545
So now it ends.

01:47:43.135 --> 01:47:44.715
What kept you?

01:50:00.585 --> 01:50:02.545
There can be only one.

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:38.295
The Quickening overcomes me!

01:50:39.175 --> 01:50:41.375
I know everything!

01:50:42.175 --> 01:50:45.295
I know! I know everything!

01:50:45.415 --> 01:50:47.635
I am everything!

01:51:46.715 --> 01:51:49.505
So, this is where it all began.

01:51:50.835 --> 01:51:53.215
Can you tell me about the prize?

01:51:53.635 --> 01:51:55.835
It's like a whirlwind in my head.

01:51:56.255 --> 01:52:01.175
But if I concentrate, I know what
people are thinking all over the world.

01:52:01.585 --> 01:52:05.465
Presidents, diplomats, scientists.

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:08.755
I can help them understand each other.

01:52:09.675 --> 01:52:11.505
What am I thinking?

01:52:11.925 --> 01:52:15.625
You're thinking whether or not
you can love me. You can!

01:52:16.045 --> 01:52:21.295
