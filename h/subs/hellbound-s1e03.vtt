WEBVTT

00:11.011 --> 00:12.512
The VIPs are here.

00:12.595 --> 00:13.596
Don't push.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.015
Back off.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.364
Are you all right?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.324
Yes.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.953
All right, it is time.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.040
Everyone except the subject, please leave.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.585
Officers, you should wait outside too.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.097
Hey. Make the warning announcement.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.144
Please start the announcement.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.230
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

01:04.314 --> 01:07.567
The demonstration of damnation
will start soon.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.404
Park Jungja,
the subject of the demonstration,

01:11.488 --> 01:15.200
received a decree of damnation
around 10:00 p.m. four days ago.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.705
The demonstration
is a form of divine intervention

01:20.789 --> 01:24.250
that publicly shows the eternal pain
the subject is to suffer in Hell.

01:26.127 --> 01:31.341
This is God's will to teach humanity
the weight of sin.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.010
All of you who are watching this

01:34.761 --> 01:38.473
must shed your arrogance and stubbornness

01:39.224 --> 01:42.435
and witness the divine intervention
with penitence.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.697
COUNTDOWN FOR DEMONSTRATION
OF PARK JUNGJA TO BEGIN SHORTLY

02:00.787 --> 02:04.040
Ten, nine, eight,

02:05.416 --> 02:09.045
seven, six, five,

02:09.879 --> 02:12.382
four, three,

02:13.299 --> 02:15.593
two, one.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.516
DAMNATION IS THE ONLY SOLUTION

02:40.910 --> 02:43.830
DO NOT HAVE MERCY ON THE DEVIL
GOD'S JUDGMENT DAY HAS ARRIVED

03:38.384 --> 03:39.636
How is this possible?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.888
Open fire! Everyone, fire!

03:41.971 --> 03:44.224
Fire, you dipshits! Open fire!

03:47.644 --> 03:48.978
YOU SHALL HAVE NO REST IN HELL

03:49.062 --> 03:50.063
Open fire!

03:52.774 --> 03:54.275
Come on! Open fire!

04:11.668 --> 04:13.169
Please help me.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.896
Oh, fuck!

05:50.224 --> 05:53.978
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

07:20.523 --> 07:21.524
Excuse me!

07:27.029 --> 07:28.197
Eunpyo!

08:15.077 --> 08:16.829
Your call cannot be connected…

09:05.753 --> 09:10.383
SEOBUK POLICE STATION

09:41.414 --> 09:44.542
A horrifying incident
took place yesterday.

09:44.625 --> 09:48.796
Many of you witnessed
the unbelievable moment live.

09:49.338 --> 09:53.634
I'm sure everyone is waiting
to hear from one man.

09:53.718 --> 09:57.430
He has become the most important person
in Korea overnight.

09:57.513 --> 09:59.223
It turns out,

09:59.307 --> 10:03.060
we had previously reported on him
multiple times.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.272
I'm sure many of you
remember this incident.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.942
A man passing by the scene of a fire

10:10.526 --> 10:12.111
ran into the burning building

10:12.194 --> 10:14.739
and saved a four-year-old child
and her mother.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.490
I'm sure all of you remember this.

10:16.574 --> 10:17.992
This is that man.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.580
An unarmed man approached someone
threatening people with a weapon

10:22.663 --> 10:25.416
and convinced him to put the weapon down.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.418
This incident surprised many people.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.131
Would you believe me if I told you
that the hero of all these stories

10:32.214 --> 10:33.507
is the same person?

10:34.175 --> 10:39.639
Moreover, he's been warning us
about the recent incidents

10:39.722 --> 10:41.474
for over ten years.

10:41.557 --> 10:45.061
Shame on us
for not taking heed of his warning.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.521
In today's special,

10:47.605 --> 10:51.776
we bring you an exclusive interview with
Chairman Jung Jinsu of the New Truth.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.820
Hello, Chairman Jung.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.365
Hello, nice to meet you.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.658
Nice to meet you.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.869
Many people are lost and confused
and dropping their daily lives

11:01.952 --> 11:03.829
after witnessing yesterday's incident.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.915
We are in desperate need of your advice.

11:07.625 --> 11:11.253
I am sure everyone needs some time
to ponder on God's message.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.382
I think it's only natural for people
to react this way.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.424
However…

11:17.510 --> 11:19.387
doing nothing out of fear of sinning

11:19.470 --> 11:22.306
cannot be the solution.

11:23.683 --> 11:28.479
Everyone must return to their lives
and try their best to perform good deeds.

11:29.105 --> 11:31.315
Recently, three people
were subjected to the demonstration,

11:31.399 --> 11:34.151
but we are only clear on the sins of Kim,
an ex-con convicted of murder.

11:34.235 --> 11:38.072
The sins of the other two subjects,
Joo and Park, are not yet known.

11:38.155 --> 11:40.908
What could their sins be?

11:41.575 --> 11:45.371
The New Truth
is doing its best to find out,

11:46.747 --> 11:48.791
but there is a limit to the information

11:48.874 --> 11:51.085
a non-governmental organization
can access.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.586
As for Park Jungja's case,

11:53.087 --> 11:55.423
key witnesses
have already fled the country,

11:56.090 --> 11:58.843
and the identities of the police officer
and lawyers who helped them

11:58.926 --> 12:00.177
have been confirmed.

12:02.596 --> 12:05.891
I urge everyone who is watching this

12:05.975 --> 12:09.353
and all government authorities,
including the police and prosecution,

12:09.437 --> 12:11.647
to take immediate action,

12:12.231 --> 12:15.568
considering the circumstances.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.405
I think it's safe to assume
that we are all curious

12:19.488 --> 12:20.906
about the same things.

12:20.990 --> 12:24.952
Why do you think this kind of incident
is suddenly occurring so frequently?

12:25.786 --> 12:30.166
God has been sending His message
in supernatural ways

12:30.249 --> 12:32.835
throughout all of human history.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.423
Therefore, the question
shouldn't be "Why now?"

12:38.090 --> 12:41.093
"Why have we not taken heed of it?"

12:43.387 --> 12:45.765
That is what we should be asking.

12:46.807 --> 12:52.062
I've been telling you this repeatedly
for over ten years.

12:52.146 --> 12:54.690
The fact that we are having
this interview only now

12:54.774 --> 12:59.612
clearly shows how ignorant
we have been towards God's will.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.031
I think that is why

13:02.114 --> 13:04.366
God has come up with a way

13:05.201 --> 13:10.289
to convey His message
in a clearer and more direct manner.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.168
CHAIRMAN JUNG OF THE NEW TRUTH
REGARDING GOD'S MESSAGE

13:20.132 --> 13:20.966
So that…

13:24.094 --> 13:25.679
you can clearly see it.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.349
That son of a bitch.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.728
According to the New Truth,

13:32.812 --> 13:37.066
God is telling us to live by performing
justice through His message.

13:37.149 --> 13:39.860
That message may seem
a bit too obvious and conceptual--

13:39.944 --> 13:41.403
That obvious truth

13:42.905 --> 13:47.034
has never been upheld
since the beginning of humanity.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.371
And that's what makes God discontented.

13:54.041 --> 13:54.917
I'm sorry.

13:58.212 --> 14:02.675
The New Truth has studied 132 cases
of decrees and demonstrations,

14:02.758 --> 14:06.011
and compiled a record of analyses
on the subjects' sins.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.932
You can find it on our website.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.685
Once you take a look at it,

14:13.519 --> 14:17.565
you will be able to clearly understand
what God wants from us

14:17.648 --> 14:20.192
and what God forbids us from doing.

14:21.193 --> 14:24.822
I spent all night
reading that document thoroughly.

14:24.905 --> 14:29.326
I think it could be considered
the Bible of the new era.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.120
But it's not easy for ordinary people

14:31.203 --> 14:35.583
to discern justice from injustice
in their daily lives.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.585
-If everyone can be like you--
-No!

14:37.668 --> 14:38.669
We humans

14:39.628 --> 14:42.131
are always capable
of discerning right from wrong.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.466
God has given us that ability.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.889
We just have a hard time
resisting temptation

14:50.639 --> 14:53.559
when we have to choose
between good and evil.

14:53.642 --> 14:55.019
Having the right to choose…

14:55.853 --> 14:58.647
It may sound great,
but it is a punishment in disguise.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.275
Now…

15:02.443 --> 15:04.987
we no longer have the right
to neglect evil.

15:05.696 --> 15:09.825
We are now obligated
to live by performing good deeds.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.620
That's what we humans must do
in the new era.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.290
I see. I'd love to hear more,

15:16.373 --> 15:19.793
but that's all the time we have for today.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.922
I hope we can have this kind of discussion
more often in the future.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.966
I'm sorry,

15:26.550 --> 15:31.847
but I fulfilled my duty as His servant
by letting the world know of His will.

15:32.514 --> 15:36.936
I plan to look for God's traces
until He calls me again.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.816
I would like to welcome you all…

15:45.945 --> 15:47.279
to the new world.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.409
Have you all seen it?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.161
We don't deserve His love.

15:54.703 --> 15:56.455
How can He love us so unconditionally?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.671
Chairman Jung Jinsu,

16:03.754 --> 16:07.549
now is not the time to act cool
as if everything is over!

16:07.633 --> 16:09.718
God has given us a chance,

16:09.802 --> 16:12.179
and it is our duty to respond to it!

16:12.721 --> 16:13.555
All of you,

16:14.306 --> 16:15.891
don't get too excited.

16:15.975 --> 16:19.228
It will lead us nowhere!
Rage is what drives us!

16:20.229 --> 16:22.982
People act like they surrender to God

16:23.065 --> 16:25.317
after witnessing
yesterday's demonstration.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.986
But it'll soon be forgotten

16:27.069 --> 16:31.448
and those bastard scholars, writers,
and lawyers will start to blabber again.

16:31.532 --> 16:35.035
And the world will return to how it was
in the past. Do you understand?

16:35.119 --> 16:38.914
You should never underestimate
the resiliency of human stupidity!

16:39.832 --> 16:41.375
Look at them!

16:41.458 --> 16:42.376
Look!

16:42.459 --> 16:44.545
Everyone's bowing before God,

16:44.628 --> 16:48.674
but look how these bastards are
standing there with their heads held high!

16:49.425 --> 16:50.676
Don't they look familiar?

16:50.759 --> 16:55.973
They are the assholes who have been
interfering with our work all along!

16:56.056 --> 16:57.224
Those shitheads.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.188
Jin Kyunghun, you crazy bastard!

17:03.272 --> 17:05.566
Who do you think
you're firing your gun at?

17:05.649 --> 17:09.319
As long as people like them exist,
we can never rest.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.196
We've got no choice, right?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.116
We should keep working hard as usual,
don't you think?

17:15.909 --> 17:17.369
INCHEON-VANCOUVER

17:18.245 --> 17:19.496
COMPLETE RESERVATION

17:22.499 --> 17:24.585
Mom, just pack anything.
We don't have time.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.962
Hyejin, what's going on?

17:28.005 --> 17:29.798
Come on. Put your jacket on. Hurry!

17:29.882 --> 17:30.716
Hurry.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.217
My gosh.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.763
I just wanted to die in peace
in my own home.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.097
Mom, please!

17:40.267 --> 17:41.643
I'm sorry,

17:41.727 --> 17:44.146
but can you just listen to me
and hurry up?

17:54.948 --> 17:57.159
FROM KIM JEONGCHIL TO MS. MIN HYEJIN

18:23.102 --> 18:25.604
CHAIRMAN, PLEASE DELIVER
GOD'S WILL TO THE WORLD!

18:25.687 --> 18:27.940
WE WANT TO BE SERVANTS OF GOD!

18:34.196 --> 18:36.323
Isn't he that detective from yesterday?

18:36.406 --> 18:37.449
Honey, look!

18:37.950 --> 18:38.951
Who's that?

18:39.034 --> 18:40.452
What's he doing here?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.964
I RECEIVED A PROPHECY FROM AN ANGEL!
AN INTERVIEW WITH JUNG

18:52.047 --> 18:53.882
JUNG GIVING A TESTIMONY ON HIS EXPERIENCE

18:58.637 --> 19:00.722
October, 2004…

19:04.351 --> 19:07.521
WORD FROM THE PUBLISHER
PUBLISHED BY PASTOR KIM JEONGCHIL

19:13.235 --> 19:14.695
EUNHYE STUDENT RESIDENCE

19:14.778 --> 19:16.572
How dare you! Why are you here?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.073
Let go.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.074
Let go of me!

19:19.950 --> 19:21.118
Get lost, you bastard.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.911
Let go of me!

19:22.995 --> 19:25.205
-You've lost your mind.
-Where are you going?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.834
-Who are you?
-Hey.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.085
I'm a detective.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.170
You can't go up there.

19:31.253 --> 19:32.504
I'm from the police.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.673
I said I'm a police officer!

19:34.756 --> 19:37.217
Who are you? Where are you going?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.803
How dare you go in there?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.680
Why are you here?

19:41.763 --> 19:42.806
Hey!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.725
-I'm from the police.
-Hey.

19:44.808 --> 19:45.767
-Leave!
-Grab him.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.019
I'm a detective.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.187
-Move.
-Are you crazy?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.563
I'm from the police.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.648
What are you doing?

19:51.732 --> 19:52.649
Who are you?

19:53.150 --> 19:54.568
What do you think you're doing?

19:55.444 --> 19:56.403
Stop it!

19:56.904 --> 19:59.156
- Jung Jinsu. Let go of me!
- Leave, you bastard!

20:00.490 --> 20:01.408
Jung Jinsu.

20:01.491 --> 20:02.409
Stop!

20:02.492 --> 20:04.203
-Come out now, you bastard!
-Stop it!

20:04.286 --> 20:06.246
Come out, you son of a bitch!

20:06.747 --> 20:09.082
CALLING
PARK YEONGHO

20:10.125 --> 20:11.877
Your call cannot be connected.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.963
-Why isn't he picking up?
-Please try again.

20:22.888 --> 20:26.016
I'll be right back.
Lock the doors and stay inside.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.476
-Okay?
-Okay.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.985
-Hello?
-Yeongho.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.530
What have you been doing?
Why didn't you answer my calls?

20:41.406 --> 20:43.408
Someone gave me information on Jung Jinsu.

20:43.492 --> 20:47.371
Jung Jinsu received
a prophecy 20 years ago.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.084
And…

20:53.585 --> 20:56.380
JUSTICE

20:56.463 --> 20:59.216
GATEWAY TO HELL
DEATH TO THOSE WHO GO AGAINST GOD

21:02.469 --> 21:03.512
Hyejin…

21:04.638 --> 21:06.139
stop now.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.558
Yeongho, where are you?

21:09.601 --> 21:10.644
Hyejin…

21:13.188 --> 21:15.440
I'm so scared.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.570
I'm so scared.

21:23.949 --> 21:24.908
Let's…

21:27.077 --> 21:28.745
Let's stop here.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.582
You should run away.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.670
Run away.

21:36.753 --> 21:38.797
Hello? Yeongho?

21:47.180 --> 21:48.890
Run.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.536
MOM

22:15.834 --> 22:16.710
Mom…

22:18.920 --> 22:20.339
-Grandma. Look here.
-Hey!

22:23.800 --> 22:25.844
-Get the fuck out of my way.
-Damn it.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.851
Here comes the old hag!

22:34.019 --> 22:35.062
Beat her up!

22:38.315 --> 22:39.691
Move out of the way.

22:44.529 --> 22:45.947
No!

22:46.990 --> 22:49.201
Mom! Get out of my way!

22:49.284 --> 22:50.494
Mom!

22:59.669 --> 23:01.671
-Hey, are you filming this?
-Get off me.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.216
Hyejin…

23:04.966 --> 23:05.926
Hyejin!

23:14.768 --> 23:16.061
That's enough. Let's go.

23:16.144 --> 23:17.145
Damn it. Let's go.

23:19.981 --> 23:22.651
-Bye, Grandma!
-Bye, Grandma!

23:25.904 --> 23:26.988
Mom.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.913
Mom, open your eyes.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.499
Mom.

23:38.625 --> 23:40.335
Mom!

23:40.419 --> 23:42.087
Mom.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.299
Mom!

23:55.308 --> 23:56.184
Mom!

23:56.935 --> 23:57.894
Hello?

23:58.770 --> 24:00.105
I need help.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.691
Please help me.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.900
Open the door!

24:04.943 --> 24:06.486
Open the door!

24:11.450 --> 24:12.617
Heejung.

24:15.036 --> 24:16.246
-Hey!
-How dare you!

24:16.329 --> 24:17.914
Get out of there!

24:17.998 --> 24:20.000
-Get out of there now!
-Get out of there!

24:20.083 --> 24:20.959
Get out!

24:23.044 --> 24:25.422
What are you doing in someone else's room?

24:25.505 --> 24:27.132
Mom.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.843
Mom, I'm right here. Mom…

24:30.469 --> 24:32.888
-Wait outside. You can't come in.
-She's on chemo. She's 67.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.223
-She was beaten up.
-You should fill out the form.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.434
I got it. Go fill out the form first.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.608
Excuse me.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.443
Are you family?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.695
Please fill out the form.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.061
Look. Over there.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.814
Do you think that's really her?

25:30.028 --> 25:31.905
-Isn't that her?
-I think it is.

Ma'am, you can't be here.

-Is it the chairman?
-Where?

28:27.747 --> 28:29.124
-It's Chairman Jung!
-Chairman!

28:29.207 --> 28:30.125
I want to meet him.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.585
-I am here, Chairman Jung!
-When will you be back?

28:32.669 --> 28:33.962
It's Chairman Jung!

28:39.259 --> 28:40.635
Hello, Detective Jin.

28:40.719 --> 28:42.637
Jung Jinsu, you son of a bitch!

28:43.388 --> 28:45.265
Where is Heejung?

28:45.348 --> 28:48.101
Sorry you had to go through
something like this because of me.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.563
I'm sure you are worried about Heejung.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.899
Could you please hold your phone
facing the people?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.155
-Chairman Jung!
-Chairman!

29:00.739 --> 29:02.073
Hello, everyone.

let Detective Jin come to me?

29:11.040 --> 29:12.751
I need to talk to him privately.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.377
I appreciate your cooperation.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.880
Chairman Jung!

29:16.963 --> 29:18.715

Are you Pastor Kim Jeongchil?

31:52.869 --> 31:54.245
Hi, Ms. Min.

31:54.329 --> 31:56.539
Thank you for coming all this way.

31:57.457 --> 31:58.458
Please come in.

32:13.806 --> 32:14.891
Pastor Kim,

32:15.767 --> 32:18.436
you said you have something
on Chairman Jung Jinsu.

32:18.519 --> 32:19.562
That's right.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.358
I had no idea he would become so famous.

32:23.441 --> 32:27.320
Do you happen to remember this interview?

32:28.029 --> 32:30.114
Oh… Hold on.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.824
I think I still have the recording.

32:33.242 --> 32:37.121

-Here it is. Shall I play it?
-Yes, please.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.044
Okay.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.756
Hello.

32:46.839 --> 32:50.009
Hello, my name is Jung Jinsu.

32:50.093 --> 32:50.927
I see.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.514
Did you say you received
a prophecy from God?

32:55.390 --> 32:58.559
Well, I don't know if it was God,

32:59.143 --> 33:00.770
but it was something fearsome.

33:16.953 --> 33:17.870
Heejung.

33:20.915 --> 33:21.833
Heejung!

33:51.029 --> 33:52.071
Jung Jinsu!

33:53.448 --> 33:54.657
Don't move, you bastard.

33:58.745 --> 33:59.954
Hello.

34:01.039 --> 34:01.873
Please calm down.

34:02.457 --> 34:03.583
Where is Heejung?

34:05.918 --> 34:07.545
I will tell you where she is

34:08.379 --> 34:11.591
after I finish telling my story.

34:14.302 --> 34:17.221
I received a prophecy 20 years ago.

34:20.850 --> 34:21.726
What?

34:31.360 --> 34:33.029
-Wait for me.
-Hurry up.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.656
Guys, it's almost time to eat.
Where are you going?

34:35.740 --> 34:36.991
We'll be back soon.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.202
-Wait for us!
-Come back soon.

34:39.285 --> 34:40.536
It's my turn to go first.

34:48.252 --> 34:51.798
It was right over there.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.635
That's where I saw an angel
for the first time.

34:58.513 --> 35:03.810
An angel appeared to me and said this.

35:07.355 --> 35:11.984
"You will die 20 years from now
at 10:30 p.m."

35:13.486 --> 35:16.364
"You are bound for Hell."

35:18.616 --> 35:23.704
At first, I was startled
and thought I was dreaming.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.790
I was confused.

35:28.543 --> 35:29.418
It was…

35:30.670 --> 35:33.172
You wouldn't know because
you've never experienced it,

35:33.256 --> 35:36.926
but the memory of it
became more vivid as time went by.

35:41.722 --> 35:45.184
So I eagerly hunted for similar cases.

35:52.441 --> 35:53.526
At first,

35:55.444 --> 35:57.363
I hoped that it wasn't real.

35:59.532 --> 36:00.408
Then…

36:01.242 --> 36:02.994
I hoped to find just one exception.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.416
Pastor, can I get a copy
of this recording?

36:13.296 --> 36:14.797
RECYCLE BIN

36:16.007 --> 36:17.717
DO YOU WANT TO
PERMANENTLY DELETE THIS FILE?

36:20.344 --> 36:22.013
I'm afraid you can't.

36:22.513 --> 36:23.973
I just deleted the file.

36:24.932 --> 36:25.766
What?

36:28.102 --> 36:30.479
Chairman Jung came to see me
a few days ago.

36:33.107 --> 36:38.404
Do you know when he is bound for Hell
according to the prophecy?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.700
The prophecy will be fulfilled

36:45.369 --> 36:46.454
ten minutes from now.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.749
Why did you use my daughter?

36:52.460 --> 36:54.212
What do you think my sin is?

36:54.295 --> 36:57.173
Why did you get my daughter involved?!

36:58.758 --> 37:02.053
Please listen to me
until I finish my story, Detective.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.139
We don't have time for this.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.557
Your sin?

37:07.975 --> 37:09.101
I bet there isn't one.

37:09.602 --> 37:12.813
Or maybe something as petty
as stealing a pencil or two.

37:12.897 --> 37:13.731
Why?

37:14.732 --> 37:17.276
How can I not have sinned
when I am bound for Hell?

37:17.777 --> 37:20.154
You didn't grill Park Jungja
about her sins.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.407
You would've if you were sure
only sinners are bound for Hell.

37:27.119 --> 37:28.621
No wonder you're a detective.

37:31.415 --> 37:32.541
But you know,

37:34.460 --> 37:37.505
I've never stolen anything in my life.

37:39.799 --> 37:41.092
I've never lied

37:42.134 --> 37:44.220
or hurt anyone's feelings.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.890
I've done nothing wrong.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.689
I believed…

37:58.192 --> 38:00.278
that my mother would come back for me

38:02.947 --> 38:06.200
if I behaved myself and never cried.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.794
Why would God do such a strange thing?

38:19.672 --> 38:23.551
I've spent over ten years of my life
trying to find an answer.

38:24.176 --> 38:26.262
But I couldn't find it.

38:29.807 --> 38:33.144
If there is no legitimate reason
behind this strange phenomenon,

38:35.354 --> 38:37.315
would people be able to accept it?

38:41.235 --> 38:46.073
I think they will start
rioting and panicking.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.161
There has to be a reason.

38:51.037 --> 38:52.538
They need to believe

38:53.039 --> 38:56.042
that this phenomenon occurs
to make the world a better place.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.503
They need to believe that it occurs

38:59.587 --> 39:01.380
so that justice can be served.

39:04.967 --> 39:06.010
That is why…

39:08.179 --> 39:09.805
I had to make it look like

39:10.514 --> 39:12.975
only the undeniably evil
are bound for Hell.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.814
I didn't need to get your daughter
involved though.

39:20.858 --> 39:22.276
I could have done it myself.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.694
Then why?!

39:25.654 --> 39:26.864
Why did you use her?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.994
Because I was impressed by what you said.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.956
You said yourself

39:37.291 --> 39:39.627
that humans should have free will.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.797
What?

39:43.297 --> 39:44.715
According to you,

39:45.299 --> 39:48.177
this God must not believe
in humankind's free will.

39:52.973 --> 39:53.808
So?

39:56.310 --> 39:58.396
So you exploited Heejung's free will?

39:59.605 --> 40:00.648
No.

40:04.735 --> 40:09.198
I'm going to leave the world
to your free will.

40:10.574 --> 40:11.951
What are you talking about?

40:12.576 --> 40:13.828
Listen.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.040
I have been…

40:21.043 --> 40:23.504
living in constant fear…

40:25.506 --> 40:27.716
since the day I received the prophecy.

40:31.011 --> 40:34.432
Do you have any idea what it feels like
to live in fear for 20 years?

40:36.851 --> 40:39.019
The fear is relentless.

40:43.107 --> 40:45.609
The fear of committing a sin,

40:46.360 --> 40:49.738
the fear of the possibility
that I keep quiet about others' sins,

40:49.822 --> 40:51.657
the fear of eternal pain…

40:51.740 --> 40:53.659
Those fears have haunted me

40:55.244 --> 40:57.079
for 20 years.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.799
But thanks to that,

41:12.970 --> 41:15.514
I was able to live by behaving properly.

41:17.016 --> 41:20.978
I don't know why God is doing this,

41:21.520 --> 41:26.150
but I want every person in this world
to feel the same fear as mine.

41:27.651 --> 41:28.944
Eventually…

41:32.239 --> 41:35.951
that fear will make the world
more righteous.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.078
It's the fear

41:39.622 --> 41:41.165
that will

41:42.541 --> 41:44.418
set people free from sin.

41:49.715 --> 41:53.594
Chairman Jung came to me
with an intriguing offer.

41:55.513 --> 41:58.599
In return for me keeping quiet
about the prophecy he received,

41:59.433 --> 42:03.938
he promised that he would make me
the chairman of the New Truth,

42:05.606 --> 42:08.692
which will be the most influential
religious organization in the world.

42:09.985 --> 42:11.529
But what's interesting is…

42:12.613 --> 42:14.240
he asked me to earn his trust

42:16.784 --> 42:18.536
by killing you.

42:24.124 --> 42:25.501
Unfortunately,

42:25.584 --> 42:27.878
I'm the type who couldn't even harm a fly.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.398
Where are you going?

43:03.581 --> 43:07.501
I'll be a completely different chairman
from Chairman Jung.

43:08.711 --> 43:10.671
I will be a more powerful one.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.717
Anyway, it was nice meeting you, Ms. Min.

43:15.968 --> 43:16.969
Goodbye.

43:34.194 --> 43:35.738
We don't have much time.

43:47.082 --> 43:48.500
Your daughter is…

43:51.170 --> 43:54.131
waiting for you at your house.

43:55.007 --> 43:57.217
I'll give you two options.

43:59.386 --> 44:02.389
Those creatures will come and kill me now.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.143
If you film that and show it to the world,

44:07.811 --> 44:10.606
people will panic.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.026
Then you can go straight home…

44:23.619 --> 44:28.666
and arrest your own daughter
for murdering your enemy.

44:30.918 --> 44:32.002
If you do that,

44:33.295 --> 44:36.965
the world will remain orderly and just,
the way you believe it should be.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.514
If that's not what you want,

44:46.100 --> 44:49.728
just keep your damn mouth shut
about my death until the day you die.

44:51.730 --> 44:55.317
And enjoy the world I created
for you with Heejung.

44:55.401 --> 44:56.610
Be free in it.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.715
They're here.

45:22.386 --> 45:25.222
I'll leave the world in your hands.

45:29.101 --> 45:32.354
If you choose to keep quiet,

45:34.273 --> 45:36.191
please get rid of my corpse.

46:24.072 --> 46:25.240
Stop.

46:26.116 --> 46:27.159
Stop!

49:38.725 --> 49:40.394
Those New Truth freaks.
