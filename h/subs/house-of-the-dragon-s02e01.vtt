02:23.916 --> 02:26.919
<i>Duty is sacrifice.</i>

02:28.045 --> 02:32.133
<i>It eclipses all things, even blood.</i>

02:33.801 --> 02:37.013
<i>All men of honor must pay its price.</i>

02:41.601 --> 02:45.229
<i>The North owes a great duty
to the Seven Kingdoms.</i>

02:45.229 --> 02:48.482
<i>One older than any oath.</i>

02:48.482 --> 02:52.320
<i>Since the days of the First Men,
we have stood as guardians</i>

02:52.320 --> 02:54.196
<i>against the cold and the dark.</i>

02:55.740 --> 02:57.450
<i>Through its long tradition,</i>

02:57.450 --> 03:01.287
<i>the Night's Watch cultivated
its strength from doomed men</i>

03:01.287 --> 03:03.956
<i>who had their life
as their only possession.</i>

03:03.956 --> 03:06.751
<i>But my ancestor, Torrhen Stark,</i>

03:06.751 --> 03:11.297
<i>began a tradition by making
an offering at the onset of winter:</i>

03:11.297 --> 03:16.636
<i>one in 10 men from our household
was to be chosen to fortify the Watch.</i>

03:19.513 --> 03:23.684
<i>This is not a sentence but an honor.</i>

03:24.894 --> 03:28.940
<i>A duty embraced by all
who serve the North.</i>

03:28.940 --> 03:31.233
<i>Even by mine own kin.</i>

03:36.405 --> 03:38.824
<i>The North must stand ready.</i>

03:40.201 --> 03:41.786
<i>Winter is coming.</i>

03:41.786 --> 03:44.038
Coming? What is this, then,

03:44.038 --> 03:46.040
that falls from the skies
and shivers my bones?

03:46.040 --> 03:49.794
This is only a late summer snow,
my prince.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.296
In winter, it will cover all you see,

03:52.296 --> 03:54.757
and all memories of warmth
will be forgotten.

03:55.883 --> 03:58.052
It pleases me to think
that over a century ago

03:58.052 --> 04:00.763
our ancestors treated in this very place.

04:02.139 --> 04:04.100
The Conqueror and the King in the North.

04:05.851 --> 04:09.981
You, at least, had the mercy
not to threaten me with your dragon.

04:18.197 --> 04:19.323
My prince.

04:20.116 --> 04:22.076
- My lord.
- My lord.

04:22.952 --> 04:24.203
M'lord.

04:24.203 --> 04:29.500
Surely the great Torrhen Stark
would've sooner died than bent the knee.

04:29.500 --> 04:33.129
Unless he believed the Conqueror
could bring unity to the Seven Kingdoms.

04:34.422 --> 04:36.132
You are right in that.

04:36.132 --> 04:38.426
That unity is now threatened.

04:39.343 --> 04:41.929
The realm will soon tear itself apart

04:41.929 --> 04:44.682
if men do not remember
the oath sworn to King Viserys

04:45.141 --> 04:47.310
and to his rightful heir.

04:47.310 --> 04:50.855
Starks do not forget their oaths,
my prince.

04:51.397 --> 04:56.152
But you must know that my gaze is
forever torn between north and south.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.615
In winter, my duty to the Wall
is even more dire

05:00.615 --> 05:02.366
than the one I owe to King's Landing.

05:02.491 --> 05:04.660
I need my men here.

05:04.660 --> 05:07.663
Whilst your men guard against
wildlings and weather,

05:07.663 --> 05:10.333
the Hightowers plan to usurp the throne.

05:11.250 --> 05:14.712
If my mother is to defend her claim
to hold the realm united,

05:14.712 --> 05:16.088
she needs an army.

05:16.088 --> 05:17.131
War is coming

05:17.131 --> 05:19.216
to the whole of the realm, my lord.

05:19.216 --> 05:22.136
We cannot wage it without the support
of the North.

05:30.186 --> 05:34.440
My father brought King Jaehaerys
and Queen Alysanne to see the Wall.

05:35.149 --> 05:39.862
His Grace stood at this very outlook
and watched as their dragons,

05:39.862 --> 05:43.950
the greatest power in the world,
refused to cross it.

05:46.118 --> 05:49.956
Do you think my ancestors built
a 700-foot wall of ice

05:49.956 --> 05:52.458
to keep out snow and savages?

05:53.125 --> 05:54.877
What does it keep out?

05:57.004 --> 05:58.339
Death.

06:06.347 --> 06:10.977
I have thousands of graybeards
who've already seen too many winters.

06:10.977 --> 06:14.355
They are well-honed.

06:14.355 --> 06:16.065
So they're old?

06:16.941 --> 06:19.735
I can ready them to march at once.

06:19.735 --> 06:23.406
If your graybeards can fight,
the queen will have them.

06:23.406 --> 06:25.283
They will fight hard.

06:25.283 --> 06:27.076
Like Northerners.

06:27.076 --> 06:28.244
My lord?

06:29.954 --> 06:31.455
A raven's arrived.

06:31.455 --> 06:33.374
Urgent news from Dragonstone.

07:15.958 --> 07:19.337
Take your mount again.
We're flying out.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.551
I alone patrol over
a hundred miles of open sea,

07:25.551 --> 07:28.471
endlessly, to hold the blockade.

07:29.388 --> 07:32.892
Meleys must gorge and rest, as must I.

07:34.393 --> 07:36.854
- We're going to King's Landing.
- To what end?

07:36.854 --> 07:41.484
Killing Vhagar.
I cannot face that hoary old bitch alone.

07:41.484 --> 07:45.655
With my dragon and yours together,
we can kill Vhagar and her rider.

07:45.655 --> 07:47.031
Make it a son for a son.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.994
- Was this the queen's command?
- The queen remains absent.

07:51.994 --> 07:54.038
I should be at Harrenhal bending knees,

07:54.038 --> 07:56.749
but I must instead remain here
to wage her war.

07:56.749 --> 07:59.418
Or perhaps, more simply,
to await her return.

07:59.418 --> 08:02.797
She has been gone for days.
Too long. She is exposed.

08:02.797 --> 08:05.091
- She is grieving.
- The mother grieves

08:05.091 --> 08:07.551
as the queen shirks her duties.

08:09.470 --> 08:12.765
It was a raven that brought me news
of Laena's death.

08:13.766 --> 08:15.935
I existed for weeks in torment

08:17.019 --> 08:19.939
refusing to believe what I'd been told.

08:21.941 --> 08:24.652
It was only when I saw my daughter's
mortal remains

08:24.652 --> 08:27.154
that I could begin to mourn her.

08:29.490 --> 08:33.119
A raven has told Rhaenyra
that her son is dead.

08:34.287 --> 08:35.746
She needs to know it for certain.

08:35.746 --> 08:37.832
She was a fool to go alone.

08:38.624 --> 08:40.209
What if Aemond were to happen upon her?

08:40.209 --> 08:42.086
Then I would pity Aemond.

08:44.714 --> 08:46.882
The queen was wise to recuse herself.

08:48.009 --> 08:52.054
She has not acted on the vengeful impulse
that others might have.

08:53.431 --> 08:56.559
If you'd have acted when you
had the chance,

08:56.559 --> 08:58.686
Aegon's line would be extinguished.

09:00.605 --> 09:02.440
And Luke would be alive.

09:10.031 --> 09:11.657
Fly with me.

09:12.450 --> 09:15.995
- It is a command.
- Would that you were the king.

10:25.856 --> 10:26.983
M'lord.

10:29.777 --> 10:33.030
It's a marvel she was able to return
from the Stepstones at all.

10:35.408 --> 10:37.201
Barely done, but done.

10:37.660 --> 10:41.372
Seven more ships put out to sea this morn'
to fortify the blockade.

10:41.372 --> 10:43.791
The Gullet is vast,
and we're not like to have the numbers

10:43.791 --> 10:46.085
to cover all that open water.

10:48.796 --> 10:51.966
I must have my ship back at sea
to lead the effort.

10:51.966 --> 10:54.594
It'll be many weeks yet, I'd wager.

10:56.512 --> 10:57.972
But I'll have a word with my brother

10:59.015 --> 11:02.226
to see what reinforcements
the shipwrights can muster.

11:12.153 --> 11:14.739
The smithy delivered this earlier.

11:16.991 --> 11:18.200
M'lord?

11:26.876 --> 11:29.879
I had this commissioned
for Prince Lucerys.

11:32.173 --> 11:35.134
I was very sorry to hear
about your heir's death.

11:35.676 --> 11:37.678
'Twas the blackest of treacheries.

11:40.973 --> 11:45.019
Pardon, m'lord,
if it'll please you, much to do.

11:45.853 --> 11:49.190
They tell me that you are the one
that dragged my body out of the sea.

11:54.570 --> 11:56.197
It was only my duty.

12:00.743 --> 12:03.871
I am indebted to you, Alyn.

12:43.452 --> 12:45.079
Mind your posts!

12:47.999 --> 12:50.001
Keep your focus, men!

12:53.588 --> 12:56.048
- Dragon!
- Dragon!

12:56.048 --> 12:57.466
Arm the scorpion!

12:57.758 --> 12:59.969
Arm the scorpion!

13:01.846 --> 13:04.181
Approaching from the southeast!

13:04.181 --> 13:05.474
Get around!

13:09.979 --> 13:11.564
Scorpion ready!

13:11.564 --> 13:13.941
- Halt!
- Halt!

13:16.736 --> 13:18.112
Stand down, it's Vhagar!

13:18.821 --> 13:20.031
Stand down!

13:20.031 --> 13:21.949
Standing down!

13:48.851 --> 13:50.603
Where is Jaehaerys?

13:52.021 --> 13:54.023
Attending his lessons.

13:54.815 --> 13:56.525
And those are where?

13:56.525 --> 13:58.027
What do you need of him?

13:58.027 --> 14:00.196
Taking him to the small council.

14:00.196 --> 14:03.199
He'll be king one day.
He must begin his instruction.

14:03.616 --> 14:05.826
What if he does not want to be king?

14:06.994 --> 14:08.287
Where is he?

14:08.287 --> 14:09.455
The library.

14:09.830 --> 14:12.291
You must not interrupt his custom.

14:19.048 --> 14:20.716
I'm afraid.

14:23.177 --> 14:24.387
Don't be.

14:25.096 --> 14:27.431
They'd be fools to come with Vhagar
protecting the city.

14:27.890 --> 14:29.892
Not the dragons.

14:30.768 --> 14:31.978
The rats.

14:40.987 --> 14:43.406
The queen is an enduring mystery,

14:44.156 --> 14:45.574
is she not?

15:19.442 --> 15:21.110
There's a chill in the air.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.700
Summer is well and truly through.

15:29.201 --> 15:32.038
We are expected at the small council,
Your Grace.

15:47.720 --> 15:49.138
We cannot.

15:49.847 --> 15:51.057
Again.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.686
Yes, Your Grace.

16:00.399 --> 16:02.401
If you wouldn't mind?

16:35.434 --> 16:37.228
- Your Grace.
- Good day.

16:42.233 --> 16:44.527
Hello! Jaehaerys must learn
the ways of the court

16:44.527 --> 16:46.570
if he is to rule one day.

16:46.570 --> 16:47.863
Up we go.

16:49.824 --> 16:52.201
Good morrow, my lords.

16:52.201 --> 16:53.286
Mother.

16:55.454 --> 16:57.248
What news?

16:57.248 --> 17:01.961
Our letters to the Vale and to the North
continue to go unanswered.

17:02.628 --> 17:03.629
Cunts.

17:05.298 --> 17:09.302
The Stormlands should be ours
after Prince Aemond's marriage pact

17:09.427 --> 17:11.596
to the Lady Floris Baratheon.

17:11.596 --> 17:13.806
I anticipate their sworn declaration.

17:14.765 --> 17:17.893
My brother is raising
the strength of the West

17:17.893 --> 17:21.022
to mass at the Golden Tooth, but we--

17:21.022 --> 17:25.109
Yeah, thank you, my prince.
That's very helpful.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.652
My nephew, Lord Ormund,

17:26.652 --> 17:29.905
musters his forces
to sally forth from Oldtown.

17:29.905 --> 17:31.449
They expect to march quickly,

17:31.449 --> 17:34.952
meeting little resistance,
until they reach the Riverlands.

17:34.952 --> 17:36.871
My letters to Rhaenyra.
Has there been any answer?

17:36.996 --> 17:39.624
An apology for her dead son?

17:39.624 --> 17:41.167
None, Your Grace.

17:41.167 --> 17:43.419
Between that and their blockade
of the Gullet,

17:43.419 --> 17:45.463
we must presume
that the princess has refused

17:45.463 --> 17:46.964
the offered terms

17:47.089 --> 17:49.592
and that war is now inevitable.

17:49.592 --> 17:51.594
Perhaps Your Grace might lend

17:51.594 --> 17:53.930
- his voice to our outreach...
- Stop! Enough!

17:54.680 --> 17:57.016
...in hopes that new terms
might be negotiated.

17:57.141 --> 17:59.936
Release it at once!
Would someone please?

17:59.936 --> 18:02.855
Is the heir to the throne
bothering you, Tyland?

18:04.440 --> 18:08.027
No. No, no, not in the least, Your Grace.

18:08.027 --> 18:10.488
Because I think he wants a ride.

18:10.488 --> 18:11.739
- Your Grace.
- A ride?

18:11.739 --> 18:13.240
A pony ride.

18:13.366 --> 18:14.909
Wouldn't that be fun, Jaehaerys?

18:14.909 --> 18:17.411
Should the Master of Coin
be your royal steed?

18:26.587 --> 18:28.005
Your Grace!

18:28.923 --> 18:31.050
There are important matters to discuss

18:32.551 --> 18:34.303
despite Sir Tyland's interruptions.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.265
Very well.

18:38.099 --> 18:40.518
No time for amusements, Tyland.

18:41.936 --> 18:43.145
Your Grace.

18:44.230 --> 18:46.649
Off you go, Jaehaerys. Good boy.

18:49.151 --> 18:50.695
Where were we?

18:52.280 --> 18:56.450
Rhaenyra's blockade has placed
King's Landing under strain.

18:56.450 --> 18:58.828
And those pressures will multiply quickly.

18:58.828 --> 19:00.871
Well, we should've just killed her
when we had the chance.

19:00.871 --> 19:04.583
Regrettably, the opportunity
for surprise has been lost

19:04.583 --> 19:08.337
and, with it, the chance to end
this conflict quickly.

19:09.714 --> 19:11.757
We must play the board before us.

19:11.757 --> 19:14.427
If we are to break
the Sea Snake's blockade,

19:14.427 --> 19:17.096
we will need to bolster both the Lannister
and Hightower navies.

19:17.221 --> 19:19.849
We do have need for a new Master of Ships.

19:20.558 --> 19:23.185
We could offer the title
to the young Lord Dalton Greyjoy.

19:23.185 --> 19:25.396
Aemond. What is your business here?

19:25.396 --> 19:26.647
The king summoned me.

19:26.647 --> 19:28.441
You do not have a seat at this council.

19:28.441 --> 19:31.736
Aemond is my closest blood
and our best sword.

19:31.736 --> 19:33.237
I welcome him.

19:33.946 --> 19:36.907
Path to King's Landing
is through the Riverlands.

19:36.907 --> 19:40.578
We must establish a toehold there,
at Harrenhal.

19:40.578 --> 19:42.580
The Riverlords will either declare for me

19:42.580 --> 19:45.625
or they will meet Vhagar
and Sunfyre together.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.960
And we can burn the blockade
while we're at it.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.921
- Rhaenyra has dragons as well.
- Mine are bigger.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.381
If we lose the dragons to war,
there'll be no calling them back.

19:52.381 --> 19:54.008
- We must proceed cautiously.
- No.

19:54.008 --> 19:58.095
Fat, old Lord Tully will either
raise my banner or see his burn.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.181
We should fly to Riverrun.

20:00.723 --> 20:03.809
You are the king, Your Grace.
You must not put yourself at risk.

20:03.809 --> 20:06.562
And Vhagar is needed here
to deter Rhaenyra from attacking

20:06.562 --> 20:09.190
in retribution for the death of her son.

20:10.316 --> 20:14.612
Errors were made in the hours
following King Viserys's death.

20:14.612 --> 20:16.238
We mustn't compound them.

20:18.491 --> 20:21.077
You've already demonstrated
your might, Your Grace.

20:21.077 --> 20:25.373
We must now favor patience and restraint.

20:25.373 --> 20:27.208
I send ravens by the hour.

20:27.208 --> 20:31.587
Many and more houses
will declare for you in time.

20:31.587 --> 20:34.799
History and precedent
will come to your side.

20:42.598 --> 20:43.766
Good morrow, Your Grace.

20:43.766 --> 20:45.434
Good morrow, Lord Larys.

20:46.060 --> 20:49.188
I had come earlier to have a word
before the small council convened,

20:49.188 --> 20:53.776
but your handmaiden said
that you were indisposed.

20:57.029 --> 20:59.073
What is it you wish to discuss?

21:01.117 --> 21:04.537
I have completed questioning
the whole of the castle staff.

21:05.705 --> 21:07.498
They produced rather interesting details

21:07.498 --> 21:10.960
but I am satisfied I have exposed
all who betrayed our trust.

21:14.046 --> 21:15.172
And what of them?

21:16.716 --> 21:18.926
They no longer breathe our air.

21:21.095 --> 21:23.931
I have chosen your new staff personally.

21:43.117 --> 21:45.411
Give me that.

21:45.411 --> 21:46.746
Your Grace?

21:47.413 --> 21:49.415
Just leave me.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.127
Just leave me.

22:35.962 --> 22:38.130
- It's a dragon wing!
- Let's have a look!

22:39.757 --> 22:41.759
- It's a wing.
- Who cares what it is.

22:42.677 --> 22:44.303
Dragon!

24:11.015 --> 24:14.185
All hail King Aegon!

24:14.185 --> 24:16.646
"Aegon the Magnanimous,"

24:16.646 --> 24:21.734
Second of His Name, King of the Andals,
and the Rhoynar, and the First Men,

24:21.734 --> 24:24.987
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

24:24.987 --> 24:27.073
Hail King Aegon!

24:27.782 --> 24:29.408
"The Magnanimous"?

24:33.120 --> 24:34.330
Your Grace.

24:34.956 --> 24:38.000
Let's have the first petition,
my good Lord Hand.

24:42.421 --> 24:44.215
Good morrow, my-- Your Grace.

24:44.215 --> 24:47.677
It's alright.
There's no reason to be nervous.

24:47.677 --> 24:48.844
What's your name?

24:48.844 --> 24:51.097
Gr-- Jerard, Your Grace.

24:51.097 --> 24:55.393
Good morrow, Jerard.
And how might your king be of service?

24:55.893 --> 24:57.561
'Tis my flock.

24:58.562 --> 25:02.191
A tenth of them taken by

25:04.193 --> 25:09.323
the Crown on, on the cusp of winter.

25:09.323 --> 25:12.368
- If I'd had the time to plan--
- We should return them.

25:15.454 --> 25:16.914
Your Grace?

25:16.914 --> 25:18.541
Well, you need your goats
for the winter, don't you?

25:18.541 --> 25:21.377
- Sheep, Your Grace.
- Sheep, even better.

25:21.377 --> 25:23.796
I shall make your flock of sheep whole.

25:25.631 --> 25:28.050
We already made a promise
to all the Crownlands

25:28.050 --> 25:32.722
that a tithing of livestock
would be necessary to sustain the dragons

25:32.722 --> 25:37.268
for their increased activity
and, pray not, eventual fighting.

25:37.935 --> 25:39.979
Right. Right.

25:39.979 --> 25:43.024
Perhaps we could just return his sheep.
He came all this way.

25:43.024 --> 25:45.693
If you return one herder's sheep,
Your Grace,

25:45.693 --> 25:48.112
you will soon find them all
at the foot of your throne

25:48.112 --> 25:50.031
expecting the same.

25:50.573 --> 25:52.033
They won't know.

25:52.033 --> 25:58.331
When the king speaks,
Your Grace, all hear it.

26:06.923 --> 26:12.303
After further thought, I have decided that
I cannot restore your sheep.

26:12.303 --> 26:15.514
If war were to break out,
my dragons will require feed.

26:15.514 --> 26:17.016
Bring the next.

26:18.434 --> 26:22.021
Salts always run scarce
on the road to winter,

26:22.021 --> 26:23.064
Your Grace.

26:23.064 --> 26:26.484
We rely on ships from Essos
for our supply.

26:26.484 --> 26:29.737
But now, with a blockade in place
and war threatening--

26:29.737 --> 26:31.781
Yeah, that treasonous
blockade won't last long.

26:31.781 --> 26:34.325
I plan to send Vhagar to burn it to ash.

26:34.325 --> 26:35.660
Bring the next.

26:39.705 --> 26:41.332
Hugh, Your Grace.

26:44.794 --> 26:48.547
The smiths are all proud
to support Your Grace against Rhaenyra.

26:52.301 --> 26:53.261
But?

26:53.261 --> 26:54.553
But...

26:56.264 --> 26:58.266
iron costs have grown.

26:59.183 --> 27:02.603
A lone scorpion takes weeks to build.

27:03.396 --> 27:05.064
To put it simply, we are struggling.

27:06.440 --> 27:10.861
If we could but have
the Crown's coin before we started work,

27:10.861 --> 27:12.863
it would bring great relief.

27:12.863 --> 27:16.242
Not just to me, but to all the smiths
serving your cause.

27:20.830 --> 27:23.374
You shall be paid and paid well.

27:24.292 --> 27:26.502
My army cannot win a war
without your weapons.

27:26.502 --> 27:28.546
You should continue their making.

27:28.963 --> 27:32.758
Our victory depends on the efforts
of the smallfolk.

27:35.177 --> 27:37.430
You have my most sincere gratitude,
Your Grace.

27:38.347 --> 27:40.349
I'll hear the next petition.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.776
Your Grace, it filled my heart
to see you on the Iron Throne.

27:51.485 --> 27:53.988
I was only a boy when Jaehaerys
last graced the seat,

27:53.988 --> 27:55.448
but you brought forth memories of him,

27:55.448 --> 27:57.575
and you have such a deft touch
with the smallfolk,

27:57.575 --> 27:59.410
just as your father did.

27:59.410 --> 28:00.911
Thank you, my lord.

28:01.412 --> 28:03.623
I wonder, do you have a moment
for a quiet word?

28:09.712 --> 28:13.049
It is the Hand's wont to keep
a firm grip on things.

28:15.343 --> 28:17.261
He controlled your father the same way.

28:19.013 --> 28:21.599
Viserys had a certain reputation
as being pliable.

28:21.599 --> 28:23.100
I am aware.

28:24.769 --> 28:27.063
I would think, as we find ourselves

28:27.063 --> 28:29.315
standing within a hair's breadth of war,

28:29.315 --> 28:32.193
that you would wish
to be viewed differently.

28:35.529 --> 28:36.864
How?

28:36.864 --> 28:38.616
Otto Hightower

28:40.034 --> 28:42.954
was your father's Hand, Your Grace.

28:59.595 --> 29:00.805
Daughter.

29:02.014 --> 29:04.642
I requested an audience hours ago.

29:05.935 --> 29:09.772
There were many petitions.

29:12.441 --> 29:14.277
I find myself wondering,

29:15.444 --> 29:17.238
do we pursue the same end?

29:19.323 --> 29:22.743
I must admit, there are days where
I myself can't be sure.

29:24.495 --> 29:26.497
I shall tell you mine.

29:28.124 --> 29:29.583
It's victory.

29:29.583 --> 29:32.420
And how would you define "victory"?

29:32.420 --> 29:34.380
Rhaenyra bending the knee

29:34.380 --> 29:37.049
and Aegon sitting
the Iron Throne, in peace.

29:37.842 --> 29:39.302
As Viserys wished.

29:39.302 --> 29:42.972
Well, if that's how you describe it,
then we are aligned.

29:42.972 --> 29:45.099
- Then be my ally.
- I am.

29:45.099 --> 29:48.936
An ally would not repeatedly cut my legs
from beneath me at that table of men!

29:48.936 --> 29:52.607
- I sit there and I feel your anger.
- Frustration.

29:52.607 --> 29:55.067
These critical days
since Viserys's passing

29:55.067 --> 29:57.987
- haven't gone to plan.
- That's not my fault.

29:59.530 --> 30:02.033
My sons both see you as the great example.

30:02.575 --> 30:03.743
The Hand to three kings.

30:05.494 --> 30:08.789
Aegon is ever-eager to prove himself
and Aemond...

30:10.416 --> 30:12.043
Aemond is angry.

30:13.586 --> 30:16.172
Rhaenyra's son took his eye
and was never punished for it.

30:16.172 --> 30:20.301
- What he did, however vicious--
- The caprice of youth.

30:24.931 --> 30:26.724
I could only hope.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.893
Aemond erred.

30:29.977 --> 30:33.397
But he is fiercely loyal.
He wishes to please.

30:33.397 --> 30:36.734
And Aegon still heeds me.
In private, at least.

30:38.277 --> 30:41.530
But if you undermine my voice,
both those boys will grow deaf to it.

30:49.956 --> 30:51.832
I hadn't seen it that way.

30:52.416 --> 30:56.671
We only need to mind Aegon
until the novelty of rule is spent.

30:57.588 --> 31:00.675
Once he tires of it, you and I can steer
our cause to victory.

31:00.675 --> 31:03.386
A fine strategy, daughter.

31:04.053 --> 31:09.684
But you must accept that the path
to victory now is one of violence.

31:10.685 --> 31:12.311
I know it.

31:16.065 --> 31:18.276
But that does not mean it must be wanton.

31:20.611 --> 31:21.612
No.

31:38.421 --> 31:40.673
Prepare to be boarded!

31:43.301 --> 31:46.429
By the order of Lord Corlys Velaryon!

31:46.429 --> 31:49.140
Search the hold for stowaways!

32:16.709 --> 32:17.710
You.

32:20.254 --> 32:23.466
When last we met, there were two of you.

32:25.718 --> 32:27.178
"The White Worm."

32:27.178 --> 32:29.764
Did you think I would
wither in your absence?

32:29.764 --> 32:31.807
I did not think you
would flower a traitor.

32:31.807 --> 32:35.144
You speak of highborn games.
I am common-born.

32:35.144 --> 32:37.647
How long have you been selling secrets
to Otto Hightower?

32:37.647 --> 32:39.482
As long as he had gold to pay for them.

32:42.109 --> 32:46.322
Who sent you fleeing from King's Landing
in such disrepair, hm?

32:47.865 --> 32:49.825
You put Aegon on the throne.

32:49.825 --> 32:51.953
That was the Hightowers' conspiracy.

32:51.953 --> 32:54.497
I merely profited from knowing
Aegon's movements.

32:54.497 --> 32:56.082
But you delivered him.

32:56.082 --> 32:59.001
He would've returned home eventually
for gold and for respite,

32:59.001 --> 33:00.169
as he always does.

33:00.169 --> 33:03.297
I simply, simply sped the business along.

33:03.297 --> 33:05.341
"Business" that ended with the theft
of the queen's throne

33:05.341 --> 33:06.592
and the murder of her son.

33:06.592 --> 33:08.552
You only blame me
because your true enemies

33:08.552 --> 33:10.263
are out of reach.

33:11.806 --> 33:14.767
My arrangement with the Hand
was purely transactional.

33:14.767 --> 33:16.769
I held no loyalty to him.

33:17.478 --> 33:19.397
Certainly do not now.

33:19.981 --> 33:23.109
Otto Hightower was to me
as I am to your noble ilk,

33:23.109 --> 33:24.694
fodder to be cast off.

33:24.694 --> 33:26.362
What else do you know of him? His plans?

33:26.362 --> 33:28.072
Little and less.

33:31.284 --> 33:34.495
I possess nothing of value to you, Daemon.

33:57.518 --> 33:58.978
Have her moved to the cells.

33:58.978 --> 34:01.689
She is to be treated
as a traitor to the crown.

34:04.442 --> 34:08.029
Forgive me, my prince,
but the lady speaks the truth.

34:08.029 --> 34:10.823
- She was no agent of the Hightowers.
- What is it to you?

34:11.907 --> 34:14.368
- A matter of honor.
- Was it honor that made you stand by

34:14.368 --> 34:17.330
and watch as the Hightowers
usurped the throne?

34:17.330 --> 34:19.248
You and your traitorous twin.

34:19.957 --> 34:21.959
No, my prince.

34:23.336 --> 34:24.754
I'm shamed by it.

34:25.379 --> 34:29.508
That's why I abandoned the Kingsguard,
and my brother, and came here.

34:29.508 --> 34:31.218
I don't care.

34:32.094 --> 34:34.972
Aegon was in your grasp.
You should've killed him yourself.

34:34.972 --> 34:37.642
Arryk and I were named
to the Kingsguard at just 8 and 10.

34:38.601 --> 34:42.605
And we swore the same oath:
to defend the whole of the royal family.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.318
So what were we to do
when they turned against one another?

35:16.222 --> 35:20.518
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen,
the First of Her Name,

35:20.518 --> 35:24.897
Queen of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,
and the First Men,

35:24.897 --> 35:28.985
Lady of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm.

35:35.032 --> 35:37.243
Did you find what you needed?

35:45.835 --> 35:48.462
Your council stands
at the ready, Your Grace.

35:52.633 --> 35:57.096
I will fly to Harrenhal at your command
and set our toehold in the Riverlands.

35:58.097 --> 36:00.266
Your Grace, my lord husband's
blockade of the Gullet

36:00.266 --> 36:01.309
moves into place.

36:01.309 --> 36:04.854
All seaborne travel and trade
to King's Landing will soon be cut off.

36:10.901 --> 36:14.113
I want Aemond Targaryen.

37:02.536 --> 37:05.247
In your years as a merchant of gossip,

37:05.247 --> 37:07.833
you surely accumulated spies
within the Red Keep.

37:07.833 --> 37:10.086
Servants who knew the comings and goings.

37:10.086 --> 37:12.255
Scheme with someone else, Daemon.

37:12.255 --> 37:15.549
I was once in your thrall, but no longer.

37:16.592 --> 37:18.427
A transaction, then.

37:19.178 --> 37:22.390
Your knowledge in exchange
for your freedom.

37:49.709 --> 37:50.918
Your Grace.

37:54.672 --> 37:58.259
Lady Jeyne Arryn has pledged her support

37:58.259 --> 38:01.262
in exchange for a dragon
to guard the Vale.

38:04.015 --> 38:07.018
And Lord Cregan Stark

38:09.895 --> 38:12.732
has promised 2,000 men--

38:58.110 --> 38:59.737
Alyrie Florent.

39:29.809 --> 39:31.811
Viserys Targaryen.

40:29.952 --> 40:31.454
Lucerys Velaryon.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.426
A tribute.

41:36.227 --> 41:37.812
Commander?

41:37.812 --> 41:39.897
Never gone for long.

41:41.691 --> 41:44.777
I'm told you bear a mislike
for the Hightowers.

41:46.195 --> 41:48.072
Fuck the Hightowers.

41:53.744 --> 41:55.371
Keep walking.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.168
Don't make trouble.

42:09.051 --> 42:12.513
The White Worm said
you're one of Aegon's ratcatchers.

42:12.513 --> 42:14.015
You must be busy.

42:14.015 --> 42:16.267
That castle positively
crawls with them now.

42:17.643 --> 42:19.604
I heard the White Worm were dead.

42:19.604 --> 42:21.772
Her ghost told me you were a betting man.

42:21.772 --> 42:22.940
Fighting pits?

42:22.940 --> 42:26.485
Dogs, and bones.

42:27.236 --> 42:28.988
How deep are your debts?

42:36.454 --> 42:38.247
I was also given to understand
that you possess

42:38.247 --> 42:40.333
a unique knowledge of the Red Keep.

42:40.333 --> 42:42.460
Maegor's tunnels.

42:42.460 --> 42:44.462
Great big rat's nest, it is.

42:45.588 --> 42:48.716
I know them better than the shape
of my own cock.

42:51.260 --> 42:52.470
This is my friend.

42:53.804 --> 42:56.223
Tonight, he's going to be your friend.

42:57.016 --> 43:00.019
You're to find and slay
the Prince Aemond Targaryen.

43:01.312 --> 43:03.814
He has silver hair and one eye.

43:03.814 --> 43:05.650
Should be easy enough to find.

43:07.985 --> 43:09.570
But I understand
he's quite good in a fight.

43:09.570 --> 43:11.489
You'll want to take caution.

43:13.115 --> 43:16.243
That's one half.
You'll get the other when it's done.

43:28.631 --> 43:29.840
Alright.

43:32.009 --> 43:33.761
What if we can't find him?

43:38.266 --> 43:41.811
We've wasted precious days in this war
of quills and ravens.

43:41.811 --> 43:43.896
Words are wind.

43:44.772 --> 43:47.066
You should be leading the van

43:47.066 --> 43:49.652
and I should be flying cover on Vhagar.

43:49.652 --> 43:53.114
No castle would dare to raise
Rhaenyra's banner against us.

43:53.114 --> 43:56.158
We would bring the whole of the Crownlands
to heel in weeks.

43:56.158 --> 43:59.036
Well, mayhaps we could petition the king,

43:59.036 --> 44:02.123
privately, to send us out.

44:03.916 --> 44:05.835
Rosby and Stokeworth,

44:05.835 --> 44:09.213
small castles right in the shadow
of King's Landing.

44:09.213 --> 44:10.798
They would not want us for enemies.

44:10.798 --> 44:13.009
We could add their levies to our own.

44:14.343 --> 44:16.804
Our host growing as we advance.

44:19.348 --> 44:21.350
It is a canny scheme.

44:21.976 --> 44:23.561
But moot.

44:23.561 --> 44:26.606
My brother is hostage
to my grandsire and mother

44:26.606 --> 44:30.151
and they tell him that a war of dragons
can yet be avoided.

44:30.151 --> 44:33.362
'Tis inevitable. They must see that.

44:33.362 --> 44:35.615
Otto fears to upset the order of things.

44:36.907 --> 44:38.909
And Alicent is simply...

44:40.119 --> 44:41.370
angry.

44:42.413 --> 44:45.875
- Angry?
- She blames me for starting this war

44:45.875 --> 44:49.962
after she plotted with my father's council
to usurp his throne.

44:51.756 --> 44:54.967
"Her Grace" speaks with two tongues.

44:58.804 --> 45:01.057
She has a gentle heart.

45:01.682 --> 45:04.310
And Rhaenyra is a cunning spider.

45:04.769 --> 45:08.731
Long ago, she drew Alicent into her web,

45:08.731 --> 45:10.650
intoxicated her.

45:12.193 --> 45:13.486
It is not your mother's fault.

45:15.613 --> 45:17.823
She holds love for our enemy.

45:19.700 --> 45:21.702
That makes her a fool.

45:38.302 --> 45:39.512
Lord Hand.

45:49.355 --> 45:51.524
Return to your post, Lord Commander.

45:51.524 --> 45:53.609
I must have a word with the prince.

46:07.540 --> 46:09.250
It would concern me, grandson,

46:09.250 --> 46:14.463
if plans were being considered
beyond the ears of your king and his Hand.

46:15.131 --> 46:17.216
You have a zeal to act. I understand.

46:17.216 --> 46:18.676
I was young once myself--

46:18.676 --> 46:21.762
I only wish to serve my king and my house.

46:27.935 --> 46:29.520
You and Vhagar

46:29.520 --> 46:32.607
are the greatest single
power in the realm.

46:34.817 --> 46:38.321
If it wasn't obvious before,
it certainly is now.

46:43.284 --> 46:46.287
But there are many pieces at play here

46:47.413 --> 46:50.249
some of which you can't yet see.

46:51.125 --> 46:54.837
I promise you, Aemond, you will have
all the vengeance that you seek

46:54.837 --> 46:58.341
but you must keep a grip on your impulses.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.679
We both know that your brother cannot.

47:21.572 --> 47:22.531
Alright.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.149
Take that.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.407
Bring the dog.

48:31.267 --> 48:33.561
I need to be a symbol for the smallfolk,

48:33.561 --> 48:36.022
- as well as the nobility.
- Wait.

48:36.022 --> 48:38.774
You could always be "Aegon the Strong."

48:38.774 --> 48:40.568
My nephew's already taken that one.

48:40.568 --> 48:42.361
Well, which would Your Grace prefer?

48:42.361 --> 48:44.238
- It's the king.
- To be loved or feared?

48:44.238 --> 48:45.698
I need to be both.

48:45.698 --> 48:50.661
My mother and grandsire
mind me like some helpless duckling.

48:50.661 --> 48:53.831
Oh, well, you're the king.
Who gives a shit what they say?

48:53.831 --> 48:56.584
My brother, at least, knows his place.

48:56.584 --> 48:58.711
He's as loyal as a hound.

48:58.711 --> 49:02.173
I can set him and his dragon
on my foes at will.

49:04.008 --> 49:06.052
- Keep your eyes down.
- I need a style that

49:06.052 --> 49:09.430
demonstrates power and commands respect.

49:09.430 --> 49:12.683
No one knows what "magnanimous" means.

49:12.683 --> 49:15.186
You could be "Aegon the Generous" then.

49:15.186 --> 49:17.438
- That would charm the smallfolk.
- I like that.

49:17.438 --> 49:18.898
Is there more strong wine?

49:18.898 --> 49:21.275
-"Aegon the Dragonheart."
- Better.

49:22.068 --> 49:23.444
"Aegon the Dragoncock!"

49:23.444 --> 49:27.615
Yes, yes! Yeah, the untamable beast!

49:50.846 --> 49:52.640
How do we get upstairs?

49:53.641 --> 49:55.059
The royals live up there.

49:56.644 --> 49:57.812
Right.

49:57.812 --> 49:59.230
Well, it's off limits, it is.

49:59.814 --> 50:02.108
Different group of ratcatchers
work the upstairs.

50:02.108 --> 50:06.112
If we're to kill a royal fucking prince,
where do you think we're gonna find him?

50:07.238 --> 50:09.115
I got you in the castle.

50:09.115 --> 50:10.908
I thought the rest was your bit.

50:13.619 --> 50:17.415
I could end you right here,
take the rest of the gold meself.

50:20.334 --> 50:24.755
I know a way upstairs.
I just don't know my way 'round.

50:27.592 --> 50:29.218
Show me.

50:31.012 --> 50:32.430
Fuck off.

50:39.687 --> 50:40.896
This way.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.794
The royals live on this level.

51:22.605 --> 51:24.231
No one's here.

51:24.857 --> 51:26.567
We need to keep looking.

51:26.567 --> 51:29.111
I've told ya,
I'm not supposed to be up here.

51:29.111 --> 51:31.197
Did you not hear the prince?

51:32.156 --> 51:35.159
No head, no gold.

51:41.707 --> 51:43.292
Set a trap.

51:44.710 --> 51:45.878
For appearances.

51:47.088 --> 51:48.923
I'll search the next room.

52:22.164 --> 52:23.457
For the rats.

52:55.531 --> 52:56.616
Quiet.

52:58.743 --> 53:00.369
Quiet.

53:03.539 --> 53:05.541
Stay still.

53:09.921 --> 53:11.631
Who the fuck is she?

53:12.965 --> 53:14.967
She's the queen, she is.

53:15.426 --> 53:18.220
"A son for a son," he said.

53:18.220 --> 53:20.681
Well, does she look like
a fucking son to you?

53:22.516 --> 53:23.976
Over there.

53:33.444 --> 53:35.404
We need to get our head and get out.

53:43.162 --> 53:46.248
They both look the same.
Which one's the boy?

53:46.248 --> 53:49.752
- Maybe that one.
- Well, look for a cock.

53:54.048 --> 53:55.383
The mother knows.

53:57.635 --> 54:02.890
Do anything but what I ask,
and I'll bleed the whole lot of ya.

54:09.522 --> 54:10.731
Which?

54:13.734 --> 54:15.444
I have a necklace.

54:17.571 --> 54:19.282
It's of great value.

54:22.952 --> 54:24.704
That's not a son.

54:48.227 --> 54:49.520
Wait.

54:50.563 --> 54:51.564
It's the other one.

54:51.564 --> 54:54.025
She's not gonna
give up the king's heir that easy.

55:04.160 --> 55:05.161
No.

55:06.829 --> 55:08.456
She's telling true.

55:12.168 --> 55:13.169
Hold him down.

55:17.214 --> 55:18.215
No.

56:21.821 --> 56:23.447
Helaena!

56:28.202 --> 56:29.829
What's happened?

56:34.083 --> 56:36.085
They killed the boy.
