BARNEY: Sometimes

00:40.331 --> 00:43.792
Dr. Lecter and I would talk,
when things got quiet enough,

00:43.835 --> 00:46.003
about the science courses
I was taking, and...

00:46.087 --> 00:49.840
CORDELL: Some kind of mail-order courses
in psychology, Nurse Barney?

00:49.966 --> 00:51.300
No, sir.

00:51.426 --> 00:55.888
See, I don't consider psychology a science,
and neither did Dr. Lecter.

01:00.060 --> 01:04.021
Now, Barney,
while you were working at the asylum,

01:04.105 --> 01:09.151
you observed Clarice Starling
and Hannibal Lecter interacting.

01:10.361 --> 01:11.945
Interacting?

01:12.030 --> 01:14.782
CORDELL: Talking to one another.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.743
Yes. Yes, it seemed to me that they...

01:17.827 --> 01:21.288
I can see you're eager to justify
your consulting fee,

01:21.331 --> 01:24.124
but why don't we start
with what you saw,

01:24.667 --> 01:26.668

about what you saw?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.545
VERGER: Cordell, don't be like that.

01:28.630 --> 01:30.923
Barney can give us his opinion.

01:31.299 --> 01:34.843
Barney, give us your opinion
of what you saw.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.679
What was it between them?

01:39.224 --> 01:40.599
Well, most of the time,

01:40.683 --> 01:43.685
Dr. Lecter didn't respond at all to visitors.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.312
He'd just, for instance,

01:45.355 --> 01:48.148
open his eyes long enough
to insult some academic

01:48.191 --> 01:50.526
who was there to look over him.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.904
With Starling, he answered her questions.

01:53.988 --> 01:57.366
She interested him. She intrigued him.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.828
He thought she was charming
and amusing.

02:02.038 --> 02:07.042
So, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter
became friendly?

02:08.502 --> 02:11.922
Well, inside a kind of formal structure, yes.

02:12.382 --> 02:15.134
And he was fond of her?

02:18.012 --> 02:19.388
Yes.

And just so we don't get off on the wrong

I'm here because I know Evelda Drumgo.

He was 40 years old.

This ill-fated drug raid,
that claimed his life and five others,

is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents,

11:15.216 --> 11:19.177
beginning with Waco, Texas, in which
the Justice Department and the FBI

11:19.261 --> 11:21.888
have been questioned
about their use of firepower

11:21.931 --> 11:23.223

it was FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling

11:25.976 --> 11:27.894
heading up the calamitous strike force.

11:27.937 --> 11:31.564
Agent Starling attained some measure
of celebrity 10 years ago,

11:31.607 --> 11:32.941
when she was given information

11:32.983 --> 11:35.694
by Dr. Hannibal "the Cannibal" Lecter,
which led to the rescue

11:35.778 --> 11:39.572
of Catherine Martin, daughter of
the former U.S. senator from Tennessee.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.355
This raid was an ugly mess.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.525
I ended up in a position
where I had a choice of dying,

13:38.567 --> 13:40.568
or shooting a woman carrying a child.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.487
I chose.

on Lecter. He'll only share it with you.

with me? You want it, seize it.

you'll know it, because I'll look at you.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.127
Why would we rather not?

14:39.211 --> 14:40.461
The last time he called

14:40.504 --> 14:43.882
was when we took Lecter off
the Ten Most Wanted list.

14:43.966 --> 14:46.801
He was upset about that.
We said, "Hey, that's life."

14:46.844 --> 14:49.971
He said, "Hey, this is
a Senate oversight committee,

14:50.014 --> 14:52.056
"to make your life miserable."

14:52.141 --> 14:56.311
His family's political contributions
may not be enough to buy a senator,

14:56.395 --> 14:59.147
but they are enough to rent them
from time to time.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.110

if he really does have something new.

of being happy.

Mr. Krendler,
when you're out on the street,

you know you might take
a bullet in the line of duty.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.954
Good morning, Mr. Verger.

17:21.957 --> 17:24.375
VERGER: Was that a Mustang
I heard out there?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.752
Yes, it was.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.795
-A five liter?
-CLARICE: Yes.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.423
Fast.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.801
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.

17:34.178 --> 17:38.806
I thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.226
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

17:47.566 --> 17:48.983
I'd like to attach this microphone

17:49.026 --> 17:51.319
to your clothing or your pillow,
if you're comfortable with that.

17:51.403 --> 17:53.237
Oh, by all means.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.995
Here, this should make it easier.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.881
You know, I thank God for what happened.

18:12.424 --> 18:14.425
It was my salvation.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.888
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent Starling?

18:19.515 --> 18:22.183
-Do you have faith?
-I was raised Lutheran.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.268
That's not what I asked.

18:24.853 --> 18:28.481
This is Special Agent Clarice Starling,
5-1 -4-3-6-9-0,

18:28.524 --> 18:31.192
deposing Mason R. Verger
on March 20, sworn and attested...

18:31.235 --> 18:32.860
-I wanna tell you about summer camp.
-Mr. Verger...

18:32.903 --> 18:35.321
-It was a wonderful childhood experience.
-We can get to that later.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.198
No, we can get to it now.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.618
You see, it all comes to bear.

18:40.702 --> 18:44.497
It was a Christian camp my father founded

18:45.499 --> 18:49.544
for poor, unfortunate,
castoff little boys and girls

18:49.628 --> 18:52.296
who would do anything for a candy bar.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.715
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.175
-I just have to...
-No, it's all right.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.469
I have immunity from the U.S. Attorneys,

18:58.595 --> 19:02.223
and I have an immunity
from the Risen Jesus.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.227
And nobody beats the Riz.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.563
Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter

19:08.605 --> 19:10.565
before the court assigned you
to him for therapy?

19:10.607 --> 19:12.233
What do you mean?

19:12.276 --> 19:13.734
Socially?

19:14.111 --> 19:15.153
(CHUCKLES)

19:15.237 --> 19:16.612
That is what I mean.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.739
Yes, if you don't mind talking about it.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.242
-Oh, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
-I didn't say you should be.

19:21.326 --> 19:25.496
No. We met conventionally,
as doctor and patient.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.832
How did he end up at your house?

19:28.458 --> 19:30.501
I invited him, of course.

19:32.045 --> 19:34.422
To my pied-à-terre.

19:34.506 --> 19:39.260
I came to the door
in my nicest "come hither" outfit.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.306
I was concerned he'd be afraid of me,

19:43.974 --> 19:47.310
but he didn't seem to be afraid of me.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.063
That's almost funny now.

19:52.441 --> 19:57.695
I showed him my toys,
my noose setup, among other things.

19:57.779 --> 20:02.074
It's a way you sort of hang yourself,
but not really.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.410
It feels good while you...

20:04.953 --> 20:06.662
Well, you know.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.750
Anyway, he said, "Mason..."

20:11.001 --> 20:13.294
Mason, would you like a popper?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.963
And I said, "Would l?

20:16.006 --> 20:20.134
"Oh, wow."
Once that kicked in, I was flying.

20:20.302 --> 20:24.180
He said, "Mason, show me how you smile

20:24.264 --> 20:26.807
"to gain the confidence of a child."

20:28.477 --> 20:30.853
Then I smiled.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.148
He said, "Oh, I see how you do it."

20:34.524 --> 20:38.319
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.238
"Try this."

20:41.114 --> 20:42.990
Try peeling off your face.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.410
"And feeding it to the dogs."

20:55.295 --> 20:57.338
LECTER: No. I can still see it.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.007
Try again.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.218
No, I'm afraid not.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.305
That's entertainment!

21:06.348 --> 21:07.807
(LAUGHING)

21:08.517 --> 21:11.269
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

21:12.145 --> 21:17.066
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that you'd
received some kind of new information.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.028
Cordell.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.837
Where did this come from?

21:37.879 --> 21:40.923
Buenos Aires. I received it two weeks ago.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.719
Where is the package it came in?

21:45.429 --> 21:47.138
Good question.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.473
There was nothing written
on it of interest.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.726
Cordell, did we throw it out?

21:52.102 --> 21:54.061
Yes, I'm afraid we did.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.480
Oh, dear. You think it'll help?

21:57.232 --> 21:58.566
I hope so.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.610
I hope it'll help you catch him,

22:01.903 --> 22:05.406
to help cleanse the stigma
of your recent dishonor.

22:06.199 --> 22:07.867
Thank you. I think that's all I need.

22:07.909 --> 22:10.911
Did you find some rapport with Dr. Lecter,

22:10.996 --> 22:13.164
in your talks at the asylum?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.251
I know I did, while I was peeling.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.463
We exchanged information in a civil way.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.008
-But always through the glass?
-Yes.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.937
Isn't it funny?

22:37.522 --> 22:38.939
What's that?

22:39.316 --> 22:41.275
You can look at my face,

22:42.694 --> 22:45.738
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

23:12.432 --> 23:13.933
Finding what you want?

23:13.975 --> 23:15.684
Are you sure this is all of it?

23:15.769 --> 23:18.312
That's all there is now. There was more,

23:18.397 --> 23:21.774
but it's been picked over
little by little over the years.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.737
You know, this stuff's worth
a lot of money in certain circles.

23:28.156 --> 23:30.491
It's kind of like the cocaine
that disappears around here,

23:30.534 --> 23:32.201
little by little.

23:53.932 --> 23:54.932
(SCREAMING)

23:58.228 --> 24:00.229

(CHATTERING)

24:41.980 --> 24:43.856
(KEYS JANGLING)

24:56.411 --> 24:58.204
Hey, Barney.

24:58.246 --> 24:59.663
Remember me?

25:00.582 --> 25:03.083
Would you agree for the record,
Agent Starling,

25:03.126 --> 25:05.544
that I've not been read my rights?

25:09.132 --> 25:11.050
I have not Mirandized Barney.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.260
He is unaware of his rights.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.932
So, when you turned Dr. Lecter over
to the Tennessee police...

25:18.016 --> 25:21.268
They weren't civil to him.
They're all dead now.

25:21.853 --> 25:24.438
Yeah, they only survived his company
three days.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.316
You survived him six years at the asylum.

25:27.651 --> 25:30.611
How'd you do that?
It wasn't just being civil.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.613
Yes, it was.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.991
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

25:36.076 --> 25:39.787
No. He once told me
that whenever feasible,

25:39.871 --> 25:42.456
he preferred to eat the rude.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.251
"Free-range rude," he called them.

25:45.752 --> 25:48.629
What about you?
You ever think he might come after you?

25:48.713 --> 25:50.464
You ever think about him at all?

25:50.507 --> 25:53.842
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it.

25:53.927 --> 25:56.595
He's always with me, like a bad habit.

25:58.473 --> 26:02.309
Do you know what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings...

26:02.352 --> 26:06.105
Everything got thrown away
when the place closed. Cutbacks.

26:07.148 --> 26:08.482
Barney, I just found out

26:08.525 --> 26:10.401
that Dr. Lecter's signed copy
of The Joy of Cooking

26:10.485 --> 26:13.487
sold to a private collector for $16,000.

26:13.989 --> 26:14.989
(EXCLAIMS)

26:15.073 --> 26:17.157
It was probably a fake.

26:17.200 --> 26:20.911
The seller's affidavit of ownership
was signed Karen Phlox.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.998
Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.458
She filled out your
employment application,

26:26.501 --> 26:29.420
only at the bottom, she signed it "Barney."

26:29.504 --> 26:31.839
Same thing on your tax returns.

26:34.884 --> 26:38.220
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

26:38.388 --> 26:40.931
I want the X-ray they shot
after you broke Lecter's arm

26:41.016 --> 26:43.350
during the attack on that nurse.

26:43.393 --> 26:45.185
And everything else you got.

26:49.482 --> 26:52.526
We used to talk about
a lot of things at night,

26:53.236 --> 26:55.988
after the screaming finally died down.

26:59.826 --> 27:02.036
We talked about you sometimes.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.288
You wanna know what he said?

27:04.372 --> 27:06.040
Go get the X-ray.

27:12.547 --> 27:15.883
-I'm not a bad guy.
-I didn't say you were.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.093
Dr. Chilton was a bad guy.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.137
After your first visit,

27:20.221 --> 27:23.599
he started taping
your conversations with Dr. Lecter.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.020
These are valuable.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.402
Go on, now.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.863
You've grieved long enough.

27:42.077 --> 27:43.786
And what'd he say?

27:44.829 --> 27:47.456
What'd he say about me, late at night?

27:47.749 --> 27:51.085
Well, he was talking about inherited,
hard-wired behavior.

27:51.127 --> 27:54.254
He was using genetics
in the roller pigeons as an example.

27:54.339 --> 27:55.714
They fly way up in the air,

27:55.757 --> 27:58.759
roll over backwards in a display,
falling toward the ground.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.137
LECTER ON TAPE: There are shallow
rollers, and there are deep rollers.

28:02.263 --> 28:04.181
You can't breed two deep rollers,

28:04.265 --> 28:07.768
or their young, their offspring,
will roll all the way down,

28:07.852 --> 28:09.603
hit, and die.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.606
Agent Starling is a deep roller, Barney.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.776
Let us hope one of her parents was not.

28:16.778 --> 28:21.532
Surely, the odd confluence of events
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

28:21.616 --> 28:24.660
Jack Crawford dangles you in front of me,

28:24.786 --> 28:27.454
then I give you a bit of help.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.665
Do you think
it's because I like to look at you

28:29.749 --> 28:33.293
and imagine how good you would taste,

28:34.129 --> 28:35.379
Clarice?

28:36.214 --> 28:38.257
CLARICE: I don't know. Is it?

28:40.635 --> 28:43.971
LECTER: I've been in this room
for eight years now, Clarice.

28:44.305 --> 28:47.808
I know they will never, ever
let me out while I'm alive.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.436
What I want is a view.

28:50.979 --> 28:54.815
I want a window where I can see a tree,
or even water.

28:54.941 --> 28:58.444
I want to be in a federal institution,
far away from Dr. Chilton.

The Capponi correspondence

Dr. Fell might hold in his hand,
his non-Italian hand,

29:19.966 --> 29:22.342
a note from Dante Alighieri himself,

29:22.385 --> 29:25.345
but would he recognize it? I think not.

Gentlemen, you have examined him
in medieval Italian,

29:30.018 --> 29:32.978
and I will not deny
that his language is admirable

29:33.021 --> 29:35.481
for a straniero, but

29:36.107 --> 29:38.358
is he acquainted with the personalities

29:38.443 --> 29:40.903
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

29:40.987 --> 29:42.696
I think not.

29:43.031 --> 29:46.116
What if he came upon a note
in the Capponi Library,

29:46.201 --> 29:48.368
say, from Guido de Cavalcanti?

29:48.411 --> 29:50.204
Would he recognize that?

30:52.559 --> 30:54.560
"Predecessor" implies I have the job.

Unfortunately, I don't, not yet,

in the Capponi Library,

-Now you're on this.

This is much less grand a case,
I would think.

Well, if I thought of my work
in those terms,

33:52.196 --> 33:54.948

and public shaming.

33:54.991 --> 33:56.616
My own never bothered me,

33:56.659 --> 33:59.953
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated,

34:00.038 --> 34:02.247
but you may lack perspective.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.625
In our discussions down in the dungeon,

34:05.710 --> 34:08.085
it was apparent to me that your father,

34:08.170 --> 34:09.629
the dead night watchman,

34:09.672 --> 34:12.299
figures largely in your value system.

34:13.467 --> 34:18.054
I think your success in putting an end
to Jame Gumb's career as a couturier,

34:18.264 --> 34:22.516
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

34:22.851 --> 34:25.978
But now, alas,
you're in bad odor with the FBI.

34:26.688 --> 34:29.900

by your disgrace?

34:30.234 --> 34:34.237

crushed by your failure?

petty end of a promising career?

34:38.659 --> 34:41.620
What is worst
about this humiliation, Clarice?

34:41.661 --> 34:45.456
Is it how your failure
will reflect on your mommy and daddy?

34:46.958 --> 34:49.460
Is your worst fear
that people will now and forever

34:49.504 --> 34:51.129
believe they were, indeed,

34:51.172 --> 34:54.757
just good old trailer-camp,
tornado-bait, white trash,

34:55.092 --> 34:57.344
and that perhaps you are, too?

35:00.681 --> 35:04.309
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the FBI's rather dull public website,

35:04.352 --> 35:06.019
that I have been hoisted

35:06.104 --> 35:08.939
from the Bureau's archives
of the common criminal,

35:09.023 --> 35:12.651
and elevated to the more prestigious
Ten Most Wanted list.

35:13.653 --> 35:17.155

or are you back on the case?

to capture Dr. Lecter

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:22.426
I think
Mr. Krendler is in collusion with him,

01:26:22.468 --> 01:26:25.470

Dr. Lecter to work for Mr. Verger.

is being paid to do this.

here today, Starling.

The FBI and the Justice Department
are looking very carefully into the charges,

and, yes, they're extremely serious.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:12.267
KRENDLER: I'd like to add
a personal note, though.

01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:14.978
Starling is one of the best agents
that we have.

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:16.230

02:00:46.405 --> 02:00:49.199
Would they give you a medal, Clarice,
do you think?

02:00:49.533 --> 02:00:53.161
Would you have it professionally framed,
and hang it on your wall to look at,

02:00:53.287 --> 02:00:56.706
and remind you of your courage
and incorruptibility?

02:00:59.919 --> 02:01:03.171
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:06.591
KRENDLER: I had plans
for that smart mouth,

02:01:06.676 --> 02:01:09.344
but I'm never gonna hire her... You now.

02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.471
LECTER: Paul?

02:01:13.015 --> 02:01:14.432
(EXCLAIMS)

02:01:14.517 --> 02:01:16.017
Remember what I said?

02:01:16.102 --> 02:01:18.311
If you can't be polite to our guests,

02:01:19.188 --> 02:01:21.856
you have to sit at the kiddies' table.

02:01:22.858 --> 02:01:24.776
Don't get up, Clarice.

02:01:25.528 --> 02:01:29.030
Paul will help me clear,
and make the coffee.

02:01:31.325 --> 02:01:33.868
LECTER: Just think about
what I said, Clarice.

02:01:35.371 --> 02:01:36.705
Coffee.

(YELLS)

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:19.247
I came halfway around the world
to watch you run, Clarice.

02:02:22.626 --> 02:02:24.252
Let me run, huh?

02:02:43.939 --> 02:02:45.940
Tell me, Clarice,

02:02:46.442 --> 02:02:48.109
would you ever say to me,

02:02:48.277 --> 02:02:51.654
"Stop. If you loved me, you'd stop"?

02:02:53.532 --> 02:02:55.533
Not in a thousand years.

02:02:57.244 --> 02:02:59.120
"Not in a thousand years."

02:03:05.086 --> 02:03:06.628
That's my girl.

(METAL CLANKING)

02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:23.561
Now, that's really interesting, Clarice.

02:03:24.438 --> 02:03:28.233
I'm really pressed for time,
so where's the key?

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:32.028
Where's the key?

(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:39.160
Okay.

02:03:44.708 --> 02:03:49.003
Above or below the wrist, Clarice?

02:03:57.012 --> 02:03:58.930
This is really gonna hurt.

Identify yourself!

I'm Clarice Starling!

02:04:56.739 --> 02:04:58.656
FBI!

02:05:58.133 --> 02:06:01.219
-Hi.
-Hi. What's that?

02:06:03.305 --> 02:06:04.806
That's caviar.

02:06:05.641 --> 02:06:07.642
What are those?

02:06:07.685 --> 02:06:08.893
These are figs.

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.020
And that?

02:06:12.815 --> 02:06:14.148
And this?

02:06:15.859 --> 02:06:18.319
That I don't think you would like.

02:06:18.737 --> 02:06:20.154
It looks good.

02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.740
-Oh, it is good.
-Can I have some?

02:06:24.159 --> 02:06:26.411
You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?

02:06:26.495 --> 02:06:29.372
-I couldn't eat what they gave me.
-Nor should you.

02:06:29.456 --> 02:06:31.958
It isn't even food,
as I understand the definition.

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:34.043
Which is why I always bring my own.

02:06:34.128 --> 02:06:35.503
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:38.756
So, which would you like to try?

02:06:41.010 --> 02:06:42.343
(EXCLAIMS)

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:45.221
Well, I suppose it's all right.

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:51.561
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me,

02:06:51.645 --> 02:06:54.522
"It is important," she always used to say,

02:06:54.982 --> 02:06:57.150
"always to try new things."

02:06:57.693 --> 02:06:59.319
