your experience, Saul,

-With respect, sir.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.131
the President of the United
States was assassinated.

The American people

No question.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.347
In fact, they're demanding it.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.265
I understand, sir,

16:55.349 --> 16:58.852
but that doesn't justify
misrepresenting intelligence

The Jalal video,
Mr. President.

He's about to tell you
not to believe

17:12.115 --> 17:15.160

with your own eyes.

17:15.244 --> 17:17.120
Why shouldn't I believe it?

17:17.204 --> 17:18.914
Because it's
raw intelligence, sir.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.666
It hasn't been
professionally vetted

17:20.749 --> 17:22.000

in the process, Saul.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.422
The video is one point
of information.

17:27.506 --> 17:29.925
There are any number of reasons
Jalal Haqqani might want

17:30.008 --> 17:32.803
to claim responsibility for
shooting down that helicopter.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.513
Like what?

17:34.596 --> 17:36.390
SAUL:
Consolidating his power,

17:36.473 --> 17:39.101
to fill the vacuum created
by his father's death.

17:39.184 --> 17:40.519
ZABEL:
What do you think,

17:40.602 --> 17:43.188
that the president didn't
cycle through all of this?

17:43.272 --> 17:45.524
Didn't consider that
Jalal's performance

17:45.607 --> 17:47.985
at the shura might have been
just that, a performance.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.653
Of course he did.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.115

at a different conclusion.

Jalal Haqqani.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.729

18:23.812 --> 18:28.066
Either they stop providing
a safe haven for the enemy

18:28.150 --> 18:30.068
or face the consequences.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.862

Mr. President.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.991
