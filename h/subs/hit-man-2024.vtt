01:01.500 --> 01:04.083
So, what does Nietzsche mean when he says,

01:04.083 --> 01:06.542
"The secret for harvesting from existence

01:06.542 --> 01:09.167
the greatest fruitfulness,
the greatest enjoyment

01:09.167 --> 01:11.250
is to live dangerously!

01:11.250 --> 01:13.708
Build your cities
on the slopes of Vesuvius!

01:13.708 --> 01:15.750
Send your ships into uncharted seas!

01:15.750 --> 01:18.875
Live at war with
your peers and yourselves!"

01:18.875 --> 01:21.792
What is he getting at here?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.375
Anybody?

01:26.625 --> 01:27.833
Sylvia.

01:28.458 --> 01:31.458
It sounds like he's saying you have to
put yourself out there.

01:32.292 --> 01:35.542
You have to take risks
and get out of your comfort zone

01:35.542 --> 01:37.708
because life is short.

01:37.708 --> 01:41.083
You have to live passionately
and on your own terms.

01:41.083 --> 01:44.333
Well, I have
a three-word response to that.

01:44.333 --> 01:46.458
Ab-so-lutely.

01:46.458 --> 01:49.542
- Says the guy driving a Civic.

02:39.042 --> 02:43.333
<i>I know on the surface
my life looks simple, a little plain.</i>

02:43.333 --> 02:46.417
<i>A guy feeding birds
and living alone with his cats</i>

02:46.417 --> 02:50.417
<i>in the suburbs, but I liked my inner life.</i>

02:50.958 --> 02:52.167
<i>I was pretty happy.</i>

02:52.917 --> 02:54.958
<i>...At least, content.</i>

02:56.167 --> 03:00.125
<i>Oh, by the way, my name is Gary Johnson,
and for a few years,</i>

03:00.125 --> 03:02.542
<i>I'd been teaching psychology
and philosophy classes</i>

03:02.542 --> 03:04.208
<i>at the University of New Orleans.</i>

03:05.292 --> 03:09.458
<i>While I'd always enjoyed
living in a world of questions and ideas,</i>

03:09.458 --> 03:12.875
<i>I also had a flair for all
things electronic and digital</i>

03:12.875 --> 03:15.500
<i>and found myself supplementing my income</i>

03:15.500 --> 03:17.208
<i>- by working part-time undercover...</i>
Hey, Gary!

03:17.208 --> 03:19.208
<i>...with the New Orleans Police Department.</i>

03:21.583 --> 03:23.333
<i>After some obligatory training,</i>

03:23.333 --> 03:26.750
<i>I was soon hiding cameras, mics,
and getting good recordings,</i>

03:26.750 --> 03:29.250
<i>mostly in murder-for-hire cases.</i>

03:30.250 --> 03:31.542
<i>What can I say?</i>

03:31.542 --> 03:36.083
<i>I was minding my own business
when my life took the oddest of turns.</i>

03:46.792 --> 03:49.208
Jasper better watch
his ass with this Craig guy.

03:49.208 --> 03:51.792
Several assault charges, possession...

03:54.333 --> 03:55.583
Hey, Gary.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.958
Look, we just heard. Jasper can't go in.

03:58.458 --> 04:01.333
Chief officially suspended him
for those teenagers he jacked up.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.375
Finally.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.042
Anyway, we're thinking you're up.

04:05.792 --> 04:08.083
I'm up? What is "up"?

04:08.083 --> 04:11.583
Congrats, Gary, you just got
promoted to contract killer.

04:15.583 --> 04:17.167
Oh, well, you reschedule.

04:18.208 --> 04:19.375
He's not even here yet.

04:19.375 --> 04:21.292
Hitmen don't cancel the first meeting.

04:21.292 --> 04:22.542
Hitmen?

04:24.042 --> 04:25.042
Hitmen don't exist.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.750
What, are we following
made-up rules now?

04:26.750 --> 04:29.417
You've seen this a million times.
You can do it.

04:29.417 --> 04:30.625
Why don't you do it?

04:30.625 --> 04:33.125
No way. Tried years ago,
almost got killed.

04:34.208 --> 04:37.083
I don't want to almost
get killed either. Okay?

04:37.083 --> 04:38.333
I'm a civilian.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.708
We got your back.

04:39.708 --> 04:42.000
We'll move in if it starts
getting pear-shaped.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.708
Clock's ticking,
I need you to grab Jasper's wire.

04:46.708 --> 04:48.750
And you might want to
check this out real quick.

04:48.750 --> 04:51.042
That is everything we know so far, Billy.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.458
- What?
- Your alias.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.125
"Billy." Let's go.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.667
<i>Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.</i>

05:11.708 --> 05:15.042
What a bunch of cancel culture bullshit...

05:15.042 --> 05:18.500
I'm sorry about this, Jasper.
So, Claude sent me to...

05:18.500 --> 05:22.417
You know, a lot of people were fine
with what I did, given the circumstances.

05:22.417 --> 05:25.583
They actually had no problem with it.

05:25.583 --> 05:30.042
If you read the comment section,
it's like two-to-one my side.

05:30.625 --> 05:31.958
That sucks.

05:32.917 --> 05:35.292
Fuck 'em.

05:35.292 --> 05:40.125
A 120-day suspension with pay. Fuck.

05:40.125 --> 05:44.542
Fuckin' fine with me.
I'm going fishin', motherfuckers.

05:44.542 --> 05:47.625
I'll spend the whole summer in Pensacola.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.500
See how everyone around here
does without me.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.583
Why are you in my car?

05:53.875 --> 05:56.583
Well, Claude said to get
your mic and transmitter.

05:57.917 --> 06:00.083
So, who's going in my place?

06:03.208 --> 06:04.208
You?

06:07.792 --> 06:08.792
Right?

06:08.792 --> 06:09.875
Wow.

06:10.417 --> 06:12.625
I just feel like
there's better candidates.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.917
Yeah, yeah.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.792
Eh... makes sense.

06:18.792 --> 06:23.750
You have this unreadable face,
perfectly forgettable.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.042
I know.

06:26.292 --> 06:28.292
So, I've been listening
on these for a while.

06:28.292 --> 06:30.583
You know, I kinda know what to say, but...

06:31.292 --> 06:33.208
any wisdom? Or tricks?

06:33.208 --> 06:37.333
Bottom line, they gotta believe it. Okay?

06:37.333 --> 06:40.458
They want you to be this killer,
so you gotta be that.

06:40.458 --> 06:44.000
You can't show any weakness.
It's-- it's constant aggression

06:44.000 --> 06:46.042
until you hear the words
out of their mouth.

06:46.042 --> 06:47.708
Got it.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.542
But you gotta be relaxed.

06:50.542 --> 06:53.667
Easy breezy.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.375
All right, so, I'm looking for...

06:55.375 --> 06:56.917
- ...like, I'm trying to...

06:59.667 --> 07:02.583
Your job is to put
these assholes in prison.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.125
- What's up, Claude?
<i>- New Billy's got to make moves.</i>

07:05.125 --> 07:06.917
<i>- Craig's here.</i>
- All right.

07:06.917 --> 07:09.167
Oh, man...

07:09.167 --> 07:12.167
You only get one first impression.
Don't fuck it up.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.875
You're not wearing those
in there, are you?

07:21.708 --> 07:23.958
Honestly, these are pretty good, man.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.583
They breathe really well.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.750
Yeah. Oh.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.375
Hah!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.917
You're Billy.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.792
You're a killer!

07:42.292 --> 07:44.042
You kill...

07:45.500 --> 07:47.042
for a living!

08:15.375 --> 08:17.833
<i>Picked a bad table.
Grab your shit. Sit down.</i>

08:27.042 --> 08:31.042
Listen, this whole thing's
gotta be based on trust.

08:32.708 --> 08:33.750
Yeah, man.

08:34.667 --> 08:35.708
No shit.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.583
So, uh...

08:40.917 --> 08:42.417
...how long you been doin' this?

08:43.500 --> 08:46.167
That's none of your fuckin' business.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.042
Oh, shit. Look at Gary.

08:49.042 --> 08:50.292
<i>You called me to do a job.</i>

08:50.292 --> 08:51.917
The man is a natural.

08:51.917 --> 08:54.000
Playing some offense here.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.125
You don't know me, I don't know you,
and at some point in the future,

08:57.125 --> 08:59.042
that's gonna be a good thing.

08:59.042 --> 09:01.875
We're not going to be friends. You got it?

09:05.083 --> 09:06.083
Got it.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.792
<i>Breathe... Think hitman thoughts.</i>

09:11.792 --> 09:14.167
- So...
- So...

09:14.167 --> 09:16.083
...you're assessing me.

09:16.083 --> 09:19.292
Am I the right guy
to eliminate your problem?

09:19.292 --> 09:23.250
And, just so you know,
I'm assessing you, too.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.667
Are you full of shit?

09:26.417 --> 09:28.125
Some big talker who's not serious?

09:28.125 --> 09:31.208
And if you are serious now,
are you one day gonna find Jesus

09:31.208 --> 09:34.250
and be so overburdened
by guilt and remorse

09:34.250 --> 09:35.500
and confess your sins?

09:35.500 --> 09:38.292
Are you gonna crack under pressure, Craig,

09:38.292 --> 09:40.625
and are you gonna point
a fucking finger at me?

09:40.625 --> 09:41.958
Never!

09:41.958 --> 09:44.000
Fuck, man, never.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.542
In fact, I got it all worked out already.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.125
Okay.

09:51.625 --> 09:52.958
Let's hear it.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.500
I work a seven and seven,

09:57.500 --> 10:01.292
so starting this coming Tuesday,
which is crew-change day outta Houma,

10:01.292 --> 10:06.167
every second of my whereabouts
is documented and accounted for.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.500
Huh?

10:07.500 --> 10:12.792
That way, uh, anything, uh...
bad were to happen,

10:13.500 --> 10:16.542
no one could think I did it, right?

10:17.500 --> 10:19.583
Not Craig, uh-uh,

10:19.583 --> 10:22.583
cause Craig is out
on an oil rig, isn't he?

10:23.167 --> 10:26.625
A hundred and twenty miles out
in the Gulf the whole damn time.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.625
What do you think about that?

10:29.625 --> 10:30.958
That's a good plan.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.250
Yeah.

10:32.250 --> 10:36.125
All right, I'd say Thursday or Friday
is probably the best time.

10:37.292 --> 10:38.792
Sounds good.

10:38.792 --> 10:40.750
So, what are you thinking exactly?

10:41.333 --> 10:45.500
You know, just take care of 'em?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.250
What does that mean, exactly?

10:48.375 --> 10:50.292
C'mon, man.

10:50.292 --> 10:52.125
You know what it means.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.875
No, he just needs to go away for good.

10:58.167 --> 11:00.375
So, what's your proximity afterwards?

11:01.500 --> 11:02.583
What do you mean?

11:04.333 --> 11:05.542
Going to the funeral?

11:05.542 --> 11:06.667
Funeral?

11:08.083 --> 11:09.500
In my ideal world,

11:10.292 --> 11:12.875
there wouldn't have to be
a funeral, would there?

11:12.875 --> 11:14.375
So, no funeral?

11:15.458 --> 11:17.292
Dude, I'm sorry, but...

11:17.875 --> 11:18.792
Oh, boy.

11:18.792 --> 11:21.125
<i>Are we actually talking about
the same thing here?</i>

11:21.875 --> 11:25.042
Going off the rails here.
C'mon, let's get back on track, Gary.

11:25.042 --> 11:28.083
<i>The reason I'm asking
is because it sounds to me</i>

11:28.083 --> 11:31.125
<i>like you're talking about
the disposal of a body,</i>

11:31.125 --> 11:33.042
which is more risky for me.

11:33.042 --> 11:34.875
Gotcha... Yeah.

11:34.875 --> 11:38.083
A faked suicide, botched robbery,
I'm in and out.

11:38.083 --> 11:41.125
What you're talking about requires me
to spend a lot of time with the body

11:41.125 --> 11:42.583
to make sure it's never discovered.

11:43.583 --> 11:46.625
Right. I'm just curious...

11:49.583 --> 11:50.875
How you do that?

11:50.875 --> 11:53.375
Look, I'll let you in
on a few of my secrets.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.417
- Yeah.
- I got different ways, but...

11:56.583 --> 11:58.208
in this case,

11:58.208 --> 12:00.417
I'll probably go full on,

12:00.417 --> 12:04.958
separate the head from the body,
do what I like to call a "bayou burial."

12:04.958 --> 12:06.917
You know Bayou Gauche?

12:06.917 --> 12:08.000
Sure do.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.667
My family's got land out there,
so, late at night,

12:11.667 --> 12:16.417
I'll drift in undetected,
drift out in a little boat,

12:17.333 --> 12:18.958
let the alligators take it from there.

12:20.667 --> 12:23.583
I mean, are we talking about the body...

12:24.958 --> 12:26.000
or the head?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.542
Body.

12:28.625 --> 12:29.708
Head...

12:31.625 --> 12:33.167
Head is a different story.

12:33.750 --> 12:34.833
Head means teeth.

12:36.083 --> 12:38.333
Teeth are a fuckin' problem.

12:38.333 --> 12:40.167
Dental records, right?

12:40.958 --> 12:41.917
Okay.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.292
So, what do you do about that?

12:46.500 --> 12:50.208
Well, I find a spot
in the middle of nowhere,

12:50.208 --> 12:52.583
stick of dynamite in the mouth...

12:53.542 --> 12:57.125
No more teeth, no more problem.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.667
- You just blow that fucker up, huh?
- Mm.

12:59.667 --> 13:00.750
Goddamn.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.750
Wow.

13:05.083 --> 13:08.583
Hey, what about fingerprints, huh?

13:08.583 --> 13:13.667
I mean, those are kinda like teeth, right?
I mean, they can identify from that?

13:13.667 --> 13:16.167
What do you do about that?

13:16.167 --> 13:18.208
I can tell you're very thorough
in your thinking,

13:18.208 --> 13:19.250
- which is good.
- Hmm.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.958
Now, in case the headless,
uneaten body is discovered,

13:23.958 --> 13:26.292
which has never happened
with me, but, yeah...

13:26.958 --> 13:28.333
no more fingertips.

13:28.333 --> 13:31.417
I would have already removed those
and dispersed them separately.

13:33.875 --> 13:37.625
Sounds kind of weird, but... I got a ritual.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.125
So, I divide the number of miles
by the number of fingers,

13:42.125 --> 13:46.792
so when I'm driving out to a location,
in this case 50 miles...

13:46.792 --> 13:50.750
I roll down the window,
toss one out every five miles or so.

13:52.167 --> 13:55.208
Just toss them fingers out the window...

13:56.458 --> 13:58.000
Shit, man, you're the--

13:58.000 --> 14:00.042
<i>you're the real deal, aren't ya?</i>

14:00.042 --> 14:01.583
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:01.583 --> 14:03.250
And by the way,

14:03.250 --> 14:05.417
I'm not running a fuckin' charity here.

14:07.375 --> 14:08.667
Did you bring the cash?

14:08.667 --> 14:11.708
Oh, shit, yeah. No, of course.

14:20.583 --> 14:24.208
I've got, uh, 2,500, uh, cash now,

14:24.208 --> 14:28.708
and, uh, I give you
the other 2,500 after, right?

14:31.042 --> 14:32.500
Great.

14:33.125 --> 14:35.833
Now, I just need
your absolute final sign-off.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.458
We're entering a contract here

14:37.458 --> 14:39.792
you won't be able to walk away from
in about a week.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.250
So, I need you to look me in the eyes,

14:41.250 --> 14:43.375
and I need to hear the words
out of your mouth right now.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.583
Chill. I just...

14:45.583 --> 14:48.958
I just thought that we, you know,
agreed to it already, but, yeah.

14:48.958 --> 14:51.750
Look man, I-I want you to off this guy

14:52.250 --> 14:55.125
in... whatever way suits you best.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.208
Got him.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.667
I knew it.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.125
We'll be in touch.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.583
I gotta say, man,

15:02.583 --> 15:04.583
hell of a profession you're in.

15:04.583 --> 15:05.708
Yep.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.667
The next time you see me,
you'll have a brand-new life.

15:09.792 --> 15:10.917
I guess so.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.958
Freeze! Put your hands up!

15:18.958 --> 15:20.042
Go, go, go, go.

15:20.042 --> 15:21.792
- What the fuck?
- Let me see your hands.

15:21.792 --> 15:23.667
- Turn, let me see your hands.
- The fuck did I do?

15:23.667 --> 15:26.083
Huh? Fuck! Fuckin' hands off--

15:26.083 --> 15:28.583
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can and will

15:28.583 --> 15:31.167
be used against you in a court of law.
You have the right to an attorney.

15:31.167 --> 15:33.708
If you so desire, and cannot afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the court.

15:33.708 --> 15:36.333
- Do you understand these rights?
Motherfucker.

15:36.333 --> 15:39.583
I understand you should
go fuck yourself. How about that?

15:40.167 --> 15:41.917
You got him. Good job.

15:43.417 --> 15:44.875
Hey!

15:44.875 --> 15:47.458
Okay, Daniel Day!

15:47.458 --> 15:49.167
Nailed that fucker.

15:49.167 --> 15:52.208
You got the cash, got the right
words out of him, sheesh!

15:52.208 --> 15:53.750
- So that was good?
- Yeah!

15:53.750 --> 15:56.417
You got him, man! Great job, Gary.

15:56.417 --> 15:59.333
That was so smooth.
Who was that guy in there?

15:59.333 --> 16:01.250
I don't know.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.667
Open and fuckin' shut.
You might have just saved a life.

16:03.667 --> 16:04.792
How's that feel?

16:04.792 --> 16:07.583
Feels good. Feels really good.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.875
Hey, can I have my pants back now?

16:09.875 --> 16:11.125
Yeah.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.125
God, you guys are weird.

16:20.208 --> 16:21.333
Hey, Gary.

16:21.333 --> 16:24.375
Does your family
really have land out on the bayou?

16:24.375 --> 16:27.667
- Oh, no, I made that part up.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.333
I have been out there a few times birding.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.333
- Birding?
- Yeah.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.125
You don't say?

16:34.125 --> 16:38.042
You know, I once saw, uh, three
pileated woodpeckers at the same time.

16:38.042 --> 16:39.792
Wh-- Uh, pileated?

16:39.792 --> 16:41.208
Yeah.

16:41.208 --> 16:46.250
Just these big beautiful
kinda pterodactyl-looking guys.

16:46.250 --> 16:49.917
Technically, it's the first cousin
to the elusive ivory-bill.

16:51.167 --> 16:54.542
Which there was a rumored
sighting of back in 2005,

16:54.542 --> 16:56.250
first in over a hundred years.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.792
Caused a big stir,
'cause most people think they're extinct,

16:58.792 --> 17:01.625
but others think
they might have just developed

17:01.625 --> 17:03.708
a successful strategy to avoid people.

17:03.708 --> 17:06.250
Can we turn up the air, Phil?

17:19.083 --> 17:21.583
Well, great work, Gary.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.708
Yeah, man.

17:22.708 --> 17:23.667
All right, bye.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.167
Oh, jeez.

17:25.167 --> 17:26.750
Bye.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.375
Do you think he knows he was being funny?

17:28.375 --> 17:31.292
I don't think so,
but it's hard to tell with Gary.

17:31.292 --> 17:34.500
You know, that throwing fingertips
out the window every five miles...

17:34.500 --> 17:38.208
- Who even thinks something like that up?
- That's some specifically twisted shit.

17:38.208 --> 17:41.208
I mean, it's safe to say
we got our new hitman,

17:41.208 --> 17:42.833
at least until Jasper gets back.

17:42.833 --> 17:46.375
120 days, that's too soon, if you ask me.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.625
Yeah, 'cause Jasper's a dick.

17:49.500 --> 17:53.417
<i>You know, people feel
almost disappointed to learn</i>

17:53.417 --> 17:55.333
<i>that hitmen don't really exist.</i>

17:55.333 --> 17:58.750
<i>This idea that there are
people out there at a retail level</i>

17:58.750 --> 18:02.042
<i>you can just hire to eliminate
your worst relationship issues</i>

18:02.042 --> 18:07.542
<i>or facilitate some money scheme,
or the usual combination of both.</i>

18:07.542 --> 18:10.708
<i>It's a total pop culture fantasy.
But because hitmen</i>

18:10.708 --> 18:15.333
<i>have been a staple of books,
movies, and TV for the last 50 years,</i>

18:15.333 --> 18:19.250
<i>good luck getting anyone to believe
their existence is all a myth.</i>

18:19.250 --> 18:22.375
<i>But of course, my job was
not to debunk the fantasy,</i>

18:22.375 --> 18:24.333
<i>but rather become the fantasy.</i>

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
<i>And I took that part of the job
very seriously.</i>

18:29.000 --> 18:32.333
<i>While I wasn't the kind of person
that could ever get worked up enough</i>

18:32.333 --> 18:36.875
<i>to want to kill or die for anything,
maybe they had cast me correctly</i>

18:36.875 --> 18:40.125
<i>because the one thing
that had prepared me for my new job</i>

18:40.125 --> 18:41.792
<i>was my primary interest:</i>

18:41.792 --> 18:45.583
<i>the eternal mystery of human
consciousness and behavior.</i>

18:46.542 --> 18:49.750
<i>So, I, uh...
got your number...</i>

18:50.708 --> 18:52.167
<i>from a friend.</i>

18:52.875 --> 18:54.292
<i>Heard we should meet.</i>

18:55.208 --> 18:59.083
<i>Sounds like you got a particular
set of skills and what not.</i>

18:59.958 --> 19:02.625
<i>Uh... shit.</i>

19:02.625 --> 19:04.792
<i>There was something else
I was supposed to say.</i>

19:07.125 --> 19:08.750
<i>Well...</i>

19:08.750 --> 19:13.125
<i>I'm sure you're picking up
my drift here of the nature of...</i>

19:13.667 --> 19:16.333
<i>Anyway, just call me back.</i>

19:16.333 --> 19:18.583
<i>My name's Walt.</i>

19:25.042 --> 19:26.083
Uh...

19:27.708 --> 19:29.000
How's the pie?

19:29.583 --> 19:31.042
All pie is good pie.

19:32.250 --> 19:34.083
All right.

19:37.708 --> 19:39.042
So...

19:40.375 --> 19:41.625
what's next?

19:45.500 --> 19:48.042
<i>You know, I'm forever fascinated
and amazed by the folks</i>

19:48.042 --> 19:50.750
<i>who actually think that some guy
they just met ten minutes ago,</i>

19:50.750 --> 19:53.542
<i>for not that much money,
would risk the death penalty</i>

19:53.542 --> 19:56.542
<i>to help them with some
crazy murderous scheme.</i>

19:58.042 --> 20:00.417
<i>I almost envy their naïveté and passion.</i>

20:01.375 --> 20:04.792
<i>You know, it doesn't matter
who you asked about finding a hitman...</i>

20:04.792 --> 20:07.917
So, you know I've, uh...
been looking for somebody

20:07.917 --> 20:12.458
to help me out with a, uh...
little problem that I'm having lately.

20:12.458 --> 20:15.917
I figured you knew somebody
in that line of work.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.750
I can ask around.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.333
All right.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.792
I don't know how serious he was,

20:21.792 --> 20:25.167
but dude was hella sketchy.
And I was scared.

20:25.167 --> 20:28.250
<i>The referral usually
finds its way to the police.</i>

20:28.250 --> 20:30.292
<i>Who make sure they get my number.</i>

20:35.292 --> 20:39.208
<i>You need to roll your tongue hard. Rrrrr...</i>

20:39.208 --> 20:42.750
<i>I realized not everyone fantasized
about the same fixer.</i>

20:43.417 --> 20:47.333
<i>So, I found tailoring the hitman
to the individual client</i>

20:47.333 --> 20:49.417
<i>was much more effective.</i>

20:49.417 --> 20:53.875
<i>And I had a knack for being
the person they needed me to be.</i>

20:53.875 --> 20:57.125
<i>♪ I'm so fucked up
I see murders selling in the park ♪</i>

20:57.125 --> 21:01.042
<i>We got our album coming up soon,
all the drama and everything from that</i>

21:01.042 --> 21:03.042
<i>is only gonna be good for us.</i>

21:03.042 --> 21:06.792
He beefin' with this cat
named Rob49, like this--

21:06.792 --> 21:08.958
He this real gangster motherfucker.

21:08.958 --> 21:11.167
So, I feel like everybody
gonna figure, you know,

21:11.167 --> 21:14.250
"that's his shit," you know, I'm thinking.
I'm gonna make sure I'm out of town,

21:14.250 --> 21:16.375
so all you gotta do is come through...

21:16.375 --> 21:18.542
Guy, I don't need your reasons

21:18.542 --> 21:20.667
or your fuckin' business plan.

21:21.625 --> 21:23.833
Give me the name and the money.

21:23.833 --> 21:26.875
All right. Straight to business.
I like that.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.792
<i>By the time
they were sitting down with me,</i>

21:33.792 --> 21:35.667
<i>they'd mostly made up their minds.</i>

21:35.667 --> 21:38.917
<i>They'd crossed that psychotic Rubicon
and just needed me to confirm</i>

21:38.917 --> 21:42.208
<i>that their darkest desires
were the right desires.</i>

21:42.208 --> 21:45.708
If you come in the side entrance,
near the poolhouse,

21:45.708 --> 21:47.208
there are no cameras.

21:47.792 --> 21:51.667
Lady, this is quite the house.

21:51.667 --> 21:54.583
And I'm not gonna let
that sumbitch take it from me.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.417
You do your part...

21:57.417 --> 21:59.375
And I'll do mine.

21:59.958 --> 22:01.333
Yes, ma'am.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.667
And after he's gone,

22:03.667 --> 22:07.833
I'll be in that big house all alone.

22:09.458 --> 22:10.583
Big house?

22:10.583 --> 22:12.292
Big house...

22:15.375 --> 22:18.417
<i>Of course, I'd charge
a high society person more</i>

22:18.417 --> 22:21.500
<i>just to seem more realistic,
but to me any payment was evidence,</i>

22:21.500 --> 22:24.375
<i>so I'd take whatever
they were able to give.</i>

22:27.458 --> 22:30.458
It's not that much,
but you can have these, too.

22:31.583 --> 22:34.042
Do you really wanna kill
your mom, Monte?

22:38.042 --> 22:39.750
You're young.

22:39.750 --> 22:41.917
You'll be making yourself an orphan.

22:41.917 --> 22:43.750
That's the point.

22:43.750 --> 22:46.250
Did I ask your opinion?

22:46.250 --> 22:47.750
Kill the bitch.

22:47.750 --> 22:51.208
<i>And they ended up giving
this little future school-shooter</i>

22:51.208 --> 22:53.208
<i>adjudicated probation.</i>

22:53.208 --> 22:54.500
Okay, Boss.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.750
<i>My would-be employers
ran the gamut.</i>

22:59.750 --> 23:02.417
<i>Evenly divided between men and women,</i>

23:02.417 --> 23:04.583
<i>young and old, rich and poor.</i>

23:10.417 --> 23:13.625
I like suicide. That seems clean.

23:14.375 --> 23:15.625
Doesn't it?

23:16.833 --> 23:18.125
That's the dream.

23:18.125 --> 23:20.958
But a left-handed person
doesn't shoot themselves

23:20.958 --> 23:22.958
with their right hand.

23:22.958 --> 23:26.375
A person with a phobia
for heights doesn't jump.

23:26.375 --> 23:29.875
A well-tied noose requires studying.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.292
Suicidal people
wanna leave this world quickly.

23:32.292 --> 23:34.417
They don't want to explain themselves.

23:35.875 --> 23:37.000
Neither do I.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.542
Maybe... surprise me?

23:39.542 --> 23:41.333
Sounds lovely.

23:43.583 --> 23:46.708
See, I filed a mental health
warning against him a while back,

23:46.708 --> 23:50.625
describing him as suicidal,
so it'll make sense to everyone.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.875
Then I can sue his doctors
for malpractice.

23:54.875 --> 23:56.625
You are smart lady.

23:58.125 --> 24:02.250
I'm thinking, cut the wrists,
then hold him 'til he bleeds to death?

24:03.292 --> 24:04.958
I am in service business.

24:04.958 --> 24:08.833
I heard that was a fairly painless
way to go, bleeding to death.

24:10.458 --> 24:13.042
Now, I don't have the kind of money

24:13.042 --> 24:15.250
you were talking about
on the phone in cash,

24:15.250 --> 24:19.292
but I have a deal
that'll be worth even more to you.

24:22.250 --> 24:23.375
See.

24:25.542 --> 24:29.667
You can have this boat,
but you can't sell it in Louisiana

24:29.667 --> 24:32.375
'cause there's an insurance claim
against it.

24:32.375 --> 24:36.292
But you take it over to East Texas,
Beaumont or Port Arthur...

24:36.292 --> 24:38.875
I guarantee you'll get
at least 6,000 for it.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.292
Speed boat.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.542
Like <i>Miami Vice.</i>

24:45.875 --> 24:48.917
Yeah! Like <i>Miami Vice.</i>

24:59.875 --> 25:04.208
Believe me, we will get to
all of this eventually,

25:04.208 --> 25:10.042
but let me jump in and pose a question
'cause I think it's going to be a lot of

25:10.042 --> 25:13.083
what we're going to be
exploring this semester,

25:13.083 --> 25:16.500
these concepts of personality,
self, and consciousness.

25:16.500 --> 25:20.167
So, my simple question is...

25:21.333 --> 25:23.708
How many of you think you know yourselves?

25:25.458 --> 25:27.708
Have a strong sense of who you are?

25:31.583 --> 25:33.792
Oh, come on, you don't know yourselves?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.000
Of course you do.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.792
Your entire being is invested
with this notion of self.

25:38.792 --> 25:41.083
It has to be for its own survival,

25:41.083 --> 25:43.708
but what we'll be doing this semester

25:43.708 --> 25:46.167
is challenging this notion.

25:47.250 --> 25:52.125
What if your "self" is a construction?

25:53.250 --> 25:56.667
An illusion, an act,
a role you've been playing

25:56.667 --> 25:59.167
every day since you can remember?

25:59.167 --> 26:00.833
<i>It's always a poignant moment</i>

26:00.833 --> 26:03.667
<i>when your ex is having a kid
with someone else.</i>

26:03.667 --> 26:04.917
We'll see.

26:06.417 --> 26:07.750
Seems like a pretty good class.

26:07.750 --> 26:09.792
<i>I know many people
despise their exes,</i>

26:09.792 --> 26:12.917
<i>but Alicia might have been my best friend.</i>

26:12.917 --> 26:14.958
<i>Or at least the person that knew me best.</i>

26:14.958 --> 26:16.708
If the "self" is a construct,

26:16.708 --> 26:21.958
and it's all just role play,
do you think people can change?

26:22.542 --> 26:27.292
Yeah, within our set-points,
which really isn't that much.

26:27.292 --> 26:29.583
Yeah, I don't know.
I was never really sure about that.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.417
You know, there's actually been
a lot of recent research and data

26:32.417 --> 26:33.500
that says we can.

26:35.583 --> 26:37.000
Enlighten me.

26:37.667 --> 26:39.833
I've been reading a lot recently
about how researchers are finding

26:39.833 --> 26:43.125
that people can change their personalities
well into their adulthood.

26:43.125 --> 26:45.833
And, I mean, I'm working
with numerous clients on it.

26:46.417 --> 26:48.250
All right. Define "change."

26:49.333 --> 26:52.792
Okay. The five traits
that make up personality.

26:52.792 --> 26:55.583
Right? Extroversion,
openness to experience,

26:55.583 --> 26:58.417
emotional stability, agreeableness
and conscientiousness.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.083
They can, they can all be altered
within just a few months.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.250
In what sense?

27:03.250 --> 27:08.125
Well, I mean, you have to embody the trait
rather than just think about it.

27:08.125 --> 27:09.958
You know, it's like the "as if" principle,

27:09.958 --> 27:12.708
where you behave "as if" you are
the person you want to be,

27:12.708 --> 27:16.125
and then pretty soon
you might realize... that is you.

27:16.125 --> 27:20.042
The old you goes... where exactly?

27:20.042 --> 27:23.875
Still there, just,
just dialed down significantly,

27:23.875 --> 27:26.417
and the... the new you is dialed up.

27:27.583 --> 27:31.583
So, you just didn't have a couple decades
to wait for me to change?

27:34.583 --> 27:35.625
Well...

27:35.625 --> 27:37.042
Uh...

27:37.042 --> 27:39.417
if there was one thing
you seemed least interested in,

27:39.417 --> 27:40.958
it was probably change.

27:40.958 --> 27:45.250
I've accepted the idea
a normal relationship isn't in my cards.

27:45.250 --> 27:47.375
No. What is normal?

27:47.375 --> 27:51.042
I mean, look at it this way,
everyone is at least a little fucked up.

27:51.042 --> 27:54.208
You just need to find someone who is
a little fucked up in a way that you like.

27:54.208 --> 27:56.958
Or at least, I don't know, in a way
that complements your own fucked-upness.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.667
And that is a different
kind of survival technique

27:58.667 --> 28:01.042
that would involve another person.

28:02.542 --> 28:04.833
- Okay.

28:04.833 --> 28:06.000
Okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.708
Speaking of, um, fucked up,

28:08.708 --> 28:14.833
I don't know, I thought you were just
doing tech support stuff for the police.

28:14.833 --> 28:17.750
Now, you're like a full-blown
undercover murder-stopper?

28:17.750 --> 28:19.167
Yeah.

28:19.167 --> 28:21.167
That's me.

28:21.167 --> 28:23.167
I'm sorry, that must be so weird.

28:23.167 --> 28:24.750
You know, I'm never
gonna give up teaching,

28:24.750 --> 28:27.625
but this undercover thing
is like field research.

28:27.625 --> 28:28.750
How so?

28:28.750 --> 28:33.542
Oh, man, you would not believe
the side of humanity I'm hanging out with.

28:33.542 --> 28:39.458
And a lot of it is seeing
how love has just curdled into hate,

28:39.458 --> 28:42.333
and... murder is just the best way out.

28:44.708 --> 28:45.875
Wow.

28:45.875 --> 28:52.208
I have a feeling you never
wanted to murder me when we were married.

28:54.042 --> 28:58.292
- You're saying it like it's a bad thing.
- Well, no, no. It's just an observation.

28:58.292 --> 29:01.042
I mean, to kill someone, I just imagine

29:01.042 --> 29:03.792
you'd have to be capable of
some serious passion.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.375
I'm not incapable of passion.

29:08.375 --> 29:10.833
For certain things, yes, definitely, but...

29:12.333 --> 29:14.542
I think you should see someone.

29:14.542 --> 29:15.958
Like a therapist?

29:15.958 --> 29:18.292
No, no. Like a, like a woman.

29:18.292 --> 29:19.958
Or whatever.

29:20.833 --> 29:23.250
I have the loyal company of Id and Ego.

29:23.250 --> 29:26.250
Okay. You need to see
a woman and a therapist.

29:33.042 --> 29:36.417
I'm tellin' ya, I just don't think
it's the best use of my skills.

29:37.417 --> 29:40.125
Just remember, Jasper,
if it weren't for the police union,

29:40.125 --> 29:42.500
you wouldn't even have a job right now.

29:42.500 --> 29:43.917
Understood.

29:43.917 --> 29:47.542
Uh, but now that I am back,
I should have my job back.

29:47.542 --> 29:50.458
- You know, at least I'm trained for it.
Um...

29:50.458 --> 29:52.375
Maybe you hadn't heard
since you were on suspension,

29:52.375 --> 29:54.542
but Gary's done a great job.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.792
His conviction rate is high,
and quite frankly,

29:57.792 --> 29:59.417
he's got a better range than you do.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.917
Do you believe that, Gary?

30:09.375 --> 30:11.250
Do you guys think that's true?

30:13.583 --> 30:14.958
Stats don't lie.

30:14.958 --> 30:17.000
You don't like your position, Jasper?

30:17.000 --> 30:19.792
Maybe I can find something
for you over in traffic patrol.

30:19.792 --> 30:23.000
Well, shit. Why don't you just have me
clean the toilets around here, Sarge?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.375
I-I could do that!

30:25.375 --> 30:27.542
Since you're being the asshole,

30:27.542 --> 30:29.625
I'll just come right out and say it.

30:29.625 --> 30:32.042
We're trying to hide your face, okay?

30:33.042 --> 30:34.833
"Who's that beating up those teenagers?"

30:34.833 --> 30:36.208
Not for no reason.

30:36.958 --> 30:38.375
Maybe you've forgotten, Jasper,

30:38.375 --> 30:41.167
unlike the nine million other
people who watched your video,

30:41.167 --> 30:44.917
but we got an angry public out there,
and we don't want them in our business.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.458
So, take my advice.

30:48.458 --> 30:52.042
Do yourself and all of us a favor.

30:52.042 --> 30:54.458
Lay low and keep your goddamn mouth shut.

30:54.458 --> 30:56.208
Can you do that?

30:57.208 --> 30:58.542
Anything else?

31:06.958 --> 31:09.708
<i>Mother was Miss Del Rio.</i>

31:09.708 --> 31:12.500
<i>They all moved to New Orleans
after Katrina.</i>

31:12.500 --> 31:15.875
<i>Parents divorced,
no father in the picture.</i>

31:17.125 --> 31:20.042
<i>Short stints hairdressing,
flight attendant.</i>

31:21.333 --> 31:23.500
<i>Married to husband, Ray Masters,</i>

31:23.500 --> 31:26.083
<i>works in his family's
oil and gas business.</i>

31:27.250 --> 31:28.625
<i>Then...</i>

31:28.625 --> 31:30.417
<i>- ...nothing.</i>

31:31.333 --> 31:33.458
<i>No criminal record.</i>

31:33.458 --> 31:36.375
<i>A couple of domestic complaints,
no arrests...</i>

31:37.958 --> 31:39.083
<i>Huh.</i>

31:43.917 --> 31:46.542
So, Madison...

31:49.167 --> 31:52.500
...who is your hitman?

32:24.875 --> 32:26.333
Are you enjoying your pie?

32:28.042 --> 32:29.708
All pie is good pie.

32:33.708 --> 32:35.083
Ron.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.375
Madison.

32:49.042 --> 32:52.083
So, tell me, Madison,
what do you do for a living?

32:52.792 --> 32:54.083
Devoted wife.

32:54.083 --> 32:55.917
Obviously.

32:55.917 --> 32:58.208
I assume that's what
we're here to talk about.

32:58.208 --> 32:59.167
Mm-hmm.

32:59.958 --> 33:01.708
And to answer your question, um...

33:03.333 --> 33:05.458
he doesn't let me work.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.625
He doesn't really let me do anything.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.708
Can I have a bite of that pie?

33:15.583 --> 33:16.583
Sure.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.292
He has me on this stupid diet.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.500
- Mm.

33:23.500 --> 33:24.667
Oh, this is good.

33:28.958 --> 33:30.500
Oh, he's cute.

33:32.917 --> 33:34.333
You a dog person?

33:36.250 --> 33:38.583
Do I look like a cat person?

33:38.583 --> 33:40.500
Yeah. I don't really get cats.

33:40.500 --> 33:41.917
Kinda creepy, you know?

33:42.792 --> 33:43.625
Really?

33:44.208 --> 33:46.000
Yeah, all those stories...

33:47.250 --> 33:48.333
What stories?

33:48.833 --> 33:52.208
The ones about, like, jealous cats
smothering babies, that kind of stuff.

33:52.875 --> 33:53.875
Whoa.

33:53.875 --> 33:56.250
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm sor-- Um--

33:56.250 --> 33:59.167
Do you know someone who's lost a child

33:59.167 --> 34:02.000
to a murderous, jealous cat?

34:02.000 --> 34:03.833
I'm just trying to do
my fact-checking here.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.667
- Not, like, personally.
- Okay.

34:05.667 --> 34:08.458
But I've heard it from,
like, a lot of people.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.000
Well, then there you go.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.167
We got to get to the bottom of this.

34:11.167 --> 34:12.167
I agree.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.333
Detective...

34:14.583 --> 34:17.167
did we pull any paw prints off the victim?

34:17.750 --> 34:20.833
No, sir, but we're herding suspects now.

34:20.833 --> 34:24.125
No small challenge as we know.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.875
Utter cat-astrophe.

34:28.875 --> 34:30.708
- What?

34:33.333 --> 34:34.583
Oh, you're good.

34:35.542 --> 34:36.708
You, too.

34:42.625 --> 34:43.917
So, what do you do?

34:47.250 --> 34:48.292
Oh.

34:49.375 --> 34:50.292
I'm sorry. I forgot.

34:50.292 --> 34:51.583
No, it's okay.

34:52.333 --> 34:53.500
This is...

34:55.542 --> 34:56.375
It's a lot.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.458
Yeah.

34:58.458 --> 34:59.500
Um...

35:01.083 --> 35:02.917
I can't believe I'm doing this.

35:06.125 --> 35:07.625
You're in good hands with me.

35:09.417 --> 35:11.458
So, h-how does this usually work?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.583
How do you want it to work?

35:14.583 --> 35:16.000
I don't know.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.292
I'm just really scared.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.625
Why are you scared?

35:25.500 --> 35:27.708
Because he's a bad person.

35:29.250 --> 35:34.292
You don't know what I married into,
and it just keeps getting worse and worse.

35:37.458 --> 35:38.917
I hear you.

35:44.875 --> 35:47.167
Did you always know you wanted to be a...

35:50.417 --> 35:52.250
Not exactly a childhood dream.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.750
Do you ever think about it?

35:54.750 --> 35:57.792
Like, if you did something else?

35:57.792 --> 36:00.958
Or... or if you chose a different path?

36:03.042 --> 36:05.917
I don't overthink things.
I'm not very sentimental.

36:06.917 --> 36:09.208
Yeah. Well, we all have regrets.

36:11.583 --> 36:14.583
Well, in my line of work,
I can't afford to think that way.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.417
I wish I could do that.

36:16.417 --> 36:18.583
But I just feel like I'm in prison,

36:18.583 --> 36:21.083
and I'm gonna die in prison.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.708
But I'm not gonna die in prison.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.750
Because what if me coming here,

36:25.750 --> 36:29.500
and meeting with you is the best decision
that I've ever made

36:29.500 --> 36:31.583
because it's for, it's for me?

36:36.042 --> 36:38.000
- Oh.

36:38.917 --> 36:40.042
Sorry.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.208
Shit.

36:45.792 --> 36:46.875
Um, it's-it's him.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.500
- I-I have to go, but I brought the...

36:49.500 --> 36:51.500
Can I throw something out there?

36:52.875 --> 36:55.208
Listen, there's nothing in this for me.

36:55.208 --> 37:00.583
Technically I'm un-employing myself here,
but do your future self,

37:01.292 --> 37:04.042
the one that deserves
a happy, fulfilling life,

37:04.042 --> 37:06.708
that can still have that, a big favor.

37:07.583 --> 37:10.708
Take what's in there and get a new life.

37:11.750 --> 37:12.625
Right now.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.042
Don't go home.

37:16.208 --> 37:17.708
And, if you need anything...

37:19.458 --> 37:21.000
or if you change your mind...

37:22.625 --> 37:23.833
you have my number.

37:42.542 --> 37:43.375
Hello?

37:43.375 --> 37:45.792
So, you're a fuckin' life coach now?

37:45.792 --> 37:48.583
Is what I just saw and listened to
what I saw and listened to?

37:48.583 --> 37:49.708
<i>I'm not believing it.</i>

37:49.708 --> 37:50.750
What?

37:50.750 --> 37:53.458
"What?" Never mind our sting operation...

37:53.458 --> 37:55.417
"Let me be your therapist?"

37:55.417 --> 37:57.333
<i>She's not a killer.</i>

37:57.333 --> 37:58.792
She just needs to get it together.

37:58.792 --> 38:02.042
I'm just out here serving
the overall public good.

38:03.667 --> 38:04.708
Public good?

38:04.708 --> 38:09.375
What you just did was
one of the most unprofessional things

38:09.375 --> 38:11.292
<i>I've ever witnessed.</i>

38:11.292 --> 38:12.583
See? See?

38:12.583 --> 38:14.750
This is what happens
when you hire an amateur.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.792
Come on!

38:15.792 --> 38:17.417
I steered clear of entrapment...

38:17.417 --> 38:19.375
<i>No, you let the jury decide that.</i>

38:19.375 --> 38:20.792
At least you got 'em in custody.

38:20.792 --> 38:22.833
Okay. We can agree
to disagree on technique.

38:22.833 --> 38:23.792
It's over.

38:23.792 --> 38:26.083
And did you notice how cute she was?

38:26.083 --> 38:28.417
I wonder if that had
anything to do with it?

38:28.417 --> 38:30.708
Well, we'll never know, will we?

38:30.708 --> 38:32.583
Since this weirdo let her off

38:32.583 --> 38:35.000
before she could start
incriminating herself.

38:36.125 --> 38:40.125
It was, um, let's say, an unusual outcome,

38:40.125 --> 38:42.750
<i>and it'll be written up as such.</i>

38:42.750 --> 38:44.292
Okay, fine...

38:46.083 --> 38:47.750
All right. Talk soon, Gary.

38:47.750 --> 38:49.625
<i>- All right.</i>
- Bye, Gary.

38:49.625 --> 38:50.708
<i>Bye.</i>

38:53.750 --> 38:57.125
Jeez Louise, he's sweatin' Gary hard.

38:57.125 --> 38:58.917
<i>I've seen this before.</i>

38:58.917 --> 39:01.375
<i>Star goes down, back-up comes in</i>

39:01.375 --> 39:04.125
<i>and just kicks ass forever more.</i>

39:04.125 --> 39:06.625
I mean, I know
he dropped the ball on this one, but...

39:06.625 --> 39:08.000
What's the name he used?

39:08.000 --> 39:10.333
- Ron.
- Yo, Ron is fuckin' dope.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.917
He's like a Caucasian Idris.

39:12.917 --> 39:17.042
I would love to grab a beer with that guy,
and I'm not talking about Gary.

39:17.042 --> 39:19.208
I would get black-out drunk with Ron.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.833
I'd let him talk me into ripping lines
on the way to Vegas.

39:21.833 --> 39:24.375
I would rip my I.U.D. out for Ron.

39:24.375 --> 39:26.583
<i>I wouldn't share a straw with Gary.</i>

39:26.583 --> 39:29.375
<i>Gary is hung like a straw, but Ron?</i>

39:29.375 --> 39:31.292
Strictly nightstick.

39:32.417 --> 39:36.250
I mean, it's kind of sounding
like you would fuck Ron, too.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.292
I would take your sloppy seconds...

39:39.875 --> 39:41.042
<i>if it were Ron.</i>

39:42.167 --> 39:47.500
This whole prosecution
has been nothing more

39:47.500 --> 39:51.542
than an entrapping, sting operation!

39:53.833 --> 39:54.958
And this guy...

39:56.000 --> 39:59.083
is the most dishonest, manipulative,

39:59.083 --> 40:02.208
fraudulent kind of person there is!

40:03.000 --> 40:06.500
This Gary Johnson isn't a human-being.

40:06.500 --> 40:10.042
For a human being has humanity.

40:10.042 --> 40:11.417
Empathy!

40:11.417 --> 40:16.875
A human being aids in moments of weakness.

40:17.500 --> 40:20.375
Gary Johnson preys on the weak.

40:21.458 --> 40:24.667
And as far as legal procedures go,

40:24.667 --> 40:27.833
it's like this undercover ghoul

40:27.833 --> 40:34.458
is using an AR-15 to kill a mosquito.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.667
<i>I am so used to this.</i>

40:36.667 --> 40:39.542
<i>While I've put forth a ton
of irrefutable evidence,</i>

40:39.542 --> 40:42.625
<i>all they've got is to somehow
make me the villain.</i>

40:42.625 --> 40:44.500
<i>And I know they're just doing their jobs,</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:47.458
<i>but a personal attack
is still a personal attack</i>

40:47.458 --> 40:51.292
<i>and kind of sucks to have to listen to.</i>

40:51.292 --> 40:55.000
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty as charged.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.375
<i>But in the "people are
forever mysteries" category,</i>

40:58.375 --> 41:00.333
<i>this would often happen:</i>

41:00.333 --> 41:03.208
I mean, I've forgiven her.
She's forgiven me,

41:03.208 --> 41:05.500
and, hell, I've done much worse.

41:06.458 --> 41:08.458
I think she deserves a second chance...

41:08.458 --> 41:10.458
<i>Which was usually followed by this:</i>

41:10.458 --> 41:13.417
In light of all the evidence
and testimony we've heard,

41:13.417 --> 41:15.458
we find the defendant not guilty.

41:17.542 --> 41:20.208
Congratulations, Tammy!

41:23.750 --> 41:26.208
<i>Maybe their love wasn't perfect,</i>

41:26.208 --> 41:28.417
<i>but it was something.</i>

41:28.417 --> 41:30.000
I hear ya.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.375
I swear, our country's legal system...

41:32.958 --> 41:33.958
Pull!

41:36.042 --> 41:37.875
...is fuckin' fucked.

41:37.875 --> 41:39.333
- Here you go.
Ah, no.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.458
You need the practice
a lot more than I do!

41:41.458 --> 41:42.875
All right, then.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.708
You can't blame someone
for taking the law

41:45.708 --> 41:47.208
- in their own hands.
- Hmm.

41:47.208 --> 41:49.167
You know, there's a thing
I really believe in.

41:49.167 --> 41:51.458
- What's that?
- That is personal justice

41:51.458 --> 41:54.250
for when our pussified
justice system fails.

41:54.250 --> 41:57.292
- When we do this, and we do it right...
- Right.

41:57.917 --> 42:00.125
...personal justice, that's gonna be yours.

42:00.125 --> 42:02.417
You didn't take all that
unfairness laying down.

42:02.417 --> 42:04.250
Hell, no I didn't.

42:06.000 --> 42:06.917
Pull!

42:10.000 --> 42:12.750
Now, that's the America
I miss right there.

42:12.750 --> 42:14.625
- Amen, amen.
- Uh-huh.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.083
Look...

42:16.083 --> 42:17.833
...there are three things
you need to kill a man.

42:17.833 --> 42:18.833
Yes.

42:18.833 --> 42:19.917
- The gun.
- Right.

42:19.917 --> 42:21.042
- The bullets.
- Mm-hmm.

42:21.042 --> 42:22.292
And the balls.

42:22.292 --> 42:24.542
And, boy, I am stockpiled
on three of those things.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.167
Son of a bitch, Tanner.

42:29.792 --> 42:30.875
Pull!

42:34.042 --> 42:35.958
That's what I'm talkin' about right there.

43:01.792 --> 43:06.250
<i>I would, of course,
never cross this line. I'm a professional.</i>

43:06.250 --> 43:08.667
<i>But technically, she didn't text me.</i>

43:08.667 --> 43:10.375
<i>She texted Ron.</i>

43:11.375 --> 43:14.583
<i>But I don't think I'm a dog person.
In fact, I may be allergic to them.</i>

43:14.583 --> 43:16.083
<i>Physically and emotionally.</i>

43:16.083 --> 43:17.625
<i>I find them to be too needy,</i>

43:17.625 --> 43:20.208
<i>just pandering to whoever holds the meat.</i>

43:21.958 --> 43:23.167
<i>But...</i>

43:23.167 --> 43:26.292
<i>at the end of the day,
we're all spineless...</i>

43:26.292 --> 43:30.500
<i>we beg for more, embarrass ourselves
for the scraps of others...</i>

43:30.500 --> 43:34.083
<i>- Dogs just don't apologize for it.</i>

43:36.042 --> 43:37.417
Buddy.

43:42.917 --> 43:44.458
You made it!

43:44.458 --> 43:47.167
Wow, I... I thought I loved puppies.

43:47.167 --> 43:51.542
Well, I gargle barbecue sauce
like Listerine before these things.

43:51.542 --> 43:53.375
Keeps the bitches bitchin'.

43:56.000 --> 43:57.250
I'm glad you came.

43:57.250 --> 43:58.958
I'm glad you invited me.

43:58.958 --> 44:01.708
So, how are you?

44:02.667 --> 44:05.375
I'm fine. I'm fine.

44:05.375 --> 44:06.708
The real question is, how are you?

44:06.708 --> 44:08.125
Oh, I'm, I'm great.

44:08.125 --> 44:10.292
Yeah. I'm... I'm great.

44:10.292 --> 44:12.208
I-I got out of there almost immediately.

44:12.208 --> 44:14.583
I have my own place now in St. Roch.

44:14.583 --> 44:18.417
I mean, it's a mess, but it's mine.
So, I love it.

44:18.417 --> 44:21.250
Um, I'm getting a divorce.

44:21.250 --> 44:22.583
- Wow.
- Yeah.

44:23.333 --> 44:25.875
Sometimes you just gotta make a move.

44:27.208 --> 44:28.750
I'm so happy for you.

44:30.458 --> 44:32.708
You know, when I saw your text, I thought,

44:32.708 --> 44:35.542
is she picking a dog charity
as the place to re-engage me?

44:35.542 --> 44:37.792
No! Oh, God, no. No.

44:37.792 --> 44:41.375
That crazy moment has passed.

44:41.375 --> 44:44.125
New me, new life, he's...

44:45.708 --> 44:46.875
And look at you now.

44:46.875 --> 44:49.333
- You like the hair?
- Oh, I love the hair.

44:50.917 --> 44:52.542
He hated it.

44:52.542 --> 44:54.958
Hated dogs, hated miniskirts.
So, you know what?

44:54.958 --> 44:57.458
I'm just making up for lost time.

44:57.458 --> 45:01.750
Well, I'm... just so happy
this is how it's all going for you.

45:01.750 --> 45:03.083
Thank you.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.458
No, but really thank you.

45:05.458 --> 45:07.417
Like, I don't want to be weird
or anything,

45:07.417 --> 45:09.042
but I kinda couldn't
have done it without you.

45:09.042 --> 45:10.292
There! I said it.

45:12.042 --> 45:15.708
I don't get a lot of
thank yous in my line of work.

45:15.708 --> 45:18.667
Yeah, I guess not.

45:18.667 --> 45:19.958
Madison.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.750
We have a situation in the husky cage.

45:22.750 --> 45:24.083
Code brown.

45:24.083 --> 45:25.292
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:25.292 --> 45:27.458
Oh, um, Ron, Jill.

45:27.458 --> 45:28.667
Jill, Ron.

45:28.667 --> 45:30.417
Nice to meet you. You need any help?

45:30.417 --> 45:32.708
No, we're good. You okay?

45:32.708 --> 45:34.125
I'm good.

45:34.708 --> 45:35.833
I got things to do!

45:35.833 --> 45:36.792
Okay.

45:38.042 --> 45:39.125
Wow.

45:39.125 --> 45:40.750
Oh, it's long, it's long!

45:41.375 --> 45:42.417
Go, go, go!

45:46.042 --> 45:47.042
There it is!

45:47.625 --> 45:49.625
Oh!

45:49.625 --> 45:51.292
Oh, no, no!

45:53.958 --> 45:55.375
No.

45:55.375 --> 45:57.083
No. No, I don't buy it.

45:57.083 --> 45:58.167
What?

45:58.167 --> 45:59.292
You're not a hitman.

45:59.958 --> 46:02.542
You can't be. You cuddled puppies.

46:02.542 --> 46:04.250
You played with kids.

46:04.250 --> 46:06.917
You've opened every door for me tonight.

46:06.917 --> 46:09.750
And yet, you kill people for money?

46:11.958 --> 46:14.125
Chivalry may be dead,
but I didn't kill it.

46:14.125 --> 46:18.375
And I tried looking you up and nothing.
It's like you don't even exist.

46:20.667 --> 46:22.292
I guess I'm just your fantasy.

46:23.417 --> 46:25.417
- Okay.

46:25.417 --> 46:27.042
We'll see about that.

46:29.750 --> 46:30.708
How many?

46:31.958 --> 46:33.792
Wait, I don't wanna-- No, I do wanna know.

46:37.750 --> 46:40.083
What? Does a gentleman not kill and tell?

46:40.083 --> 46:42.625
Okay. For the record, I love people.

46:42.625 --> 46:43.917
And yet, you kill them.

46:44.667 --> 46:46.125
Not just randomly.

46:47.542 --> 46:49.292
It's always with a purpose.

46:49.292 --> 46:51.000
- To protect.
- Hmm.

46:51.625 --> 46:53.000
And make no mistake,

46:53.000 --> 46:55.375
there are some people who need killing.

46:56.208 --> 46:57.292
Right?

47:00.250 --> 47:01.417
Right.

47:03.750 --> 47:06.750
So, what's the biggest
difference between...

47:06.750 --> 47:09.333
between the real you and your occupation?

47:09.333 --> 47:11.750
Mm.

47:11.750 --> 47:17.625
I'd say the real me... is a people person.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.333
I like to have a good time.

47:19.333 --> 47:20.458
But...

47:22.833 --> 47:27.083
To be most effective in this job,
I have to be a bit of a lone wolf.

47:27.083 --> 47:30.042
I have to never draw
any attention to myself.

47:31.000 --> 47:34.250
I don't want anyone to remember my face.
I don't want to over or under tip.

47:34.250 --> 47:37.833
I don't want to be pulled into
memorable conversations.

47:40.917 --> 47:43.333
That's why I drive a Honda Civic.

47:43.333 --> 47:45.792
I want it to seem like I don't exist.

47:46.875 --> 47:49.792
I don't know.
That's the professional side of me.

47:52.083 --> 47:54.750
Tell me a little more about
the unprofessional side.

47:57.875 --> 47:58.875
I'd say...

47:59.750 --> 48:05.292
being here with you right now is...
pretty damn unprofessional, but, hey.

48:05.292 --> 48:07.792
Good. I don't want you too professional.

48:11.042 --> 48:12.458
How do you want me?

48:17.375 --> 48:18.750
W-What?

48:19.875 --> 48:21.208
Do I scare you?

48:21.792 --> 48:22.833
No.

48:24.250 --> 48:25.208
Do I scare you?

48:25.208 --> 48:26.875
Should I be scared?

48:29.750 --> 48:31.750
That depends on what your intentions are.

48:34.542 --> 48:35.875
Okay.

48:37.875 --> 48:40.333
You want to know all about me.
But what about you?

48:40.333 --> 48:42.208
You know all you need to know.

48:43.458 --> 48:44.458
Is that right?

48:50.542 --> 48:53.542
<i>I was once told I think too much
to be a good lover.</i>

48:53.542 --> 48:56.833
<i>She said exceptional sex
requires a lack of thought,</i>

48:56.833 --> 48:59.250
<i>a certain amount of
animal abandon...</i>

49:02.250 --> 49:03.625
<i>I liked Ron.</i>

49:04.417 --> 49:06.958
<i>He wasn't a thinker. He was a doer.</i>

49:14.958 --> 49:17.417
<i>So, I don't know
if I was just better as Ron,</i>

49:17.417 --> 49:21.250
<i>or if it was that electric charge
going through both of us...</i>

49:21.250 --> 49:23.958
<i>I mean, after all,
in her mind, she was having sex</i>

49:23.958 --> 49:26.083
<i>with someone who had murdered
a bunch of people,</i>

49:26.083 --> 49:27.917
<i>and I was having sex with someone</i>

49:27.917 --> 49:30.750
<i>who was clearly capable of
having a lover killed.</i>

49:32.708 --> 49:36.500
<i>I'm not proud to say this,
but it upped my game.</i>

49:43.667 --> 49:46.625
You know, I haven't been
with anyone else in so long...

49:48.292 --> 49:49.875
Can I tell you something?

49:49.875 --> 49:51.000
What?

49:52.083 --> 49:53.417
This is fun.

49:54.625 --> 49:55.917
I agree.

49:58.667 --> 50:00.083
I like this.

50:01.167 --> 50:02.250
Us.

50:03.708 --> 50:05.167
Yeah.

50:10.167 --> 50:14.542
Look, on a full-disclosure,
cautionary note,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.958
I've had a few girlfriends,
that early marriage,

50:18.958 --> 50:23.042
but because of my line of work,
I generally have trouble

50:23.042 --> 50:28.083
maintaining what most would consider
a normal relationship.

50:28.083 --> 50:30.042
Fuck normal.

50:30.042 --> 50:31.167
Amen.

50:31.167 --> 50:32.708
Do you wanna see me again?

50:34.500 --> 50:35.750
Yeah.

50:37.542 --> 50:38.500
But...

50:40.333 --> 50:42.208
it's a little complicated. Isn't it?

50:42.208 --> 50:43.792
It doesn't have to be.

50:50.417 --> 50:52.042
This is a bad idea.

50:52.042 --> 50:53.958
I suppose it is.

51:03.125 --> 51:05.500
For instance, we can never go to my place.

51:05.500 --> 51:07.500
Good. I don't want to.

51:07.500 --> 51:11.250
I can never give you any info
about my whereabouts, at any time.

51:11.250 --> 51:13.833
If I'm tracked or traced,
you'd be pulled right in the middle of it.

51:13.833 --> 51:15.958
I will see you when I see you.

51:19.750 --> 51:21.667
And we can only get so personal.

51:22.583 --> 51:25.333
And the less you know about me,
the less I know about you...

51:25.333 --> 51:27.458
Okay, what's your next line?

51:27.458 --> 51:29.208
"Don't fall in love with me?"

51:31.250 --> 51:32.750
I know what this is.

51:34.375 --> 51:36.708
I don't want to know where you live,

51:36.708 --> 51:39.750
or what you're doing at any given moment.

51:40.375 --> 51:43.250
We're just going to meet here
whenever we want,

51:43.250 --> 51:45.375
and nothing outside of here matters.

51:49.042 --> 51:50.125
Well, okay then.

51:50.125 --> 51:51.667
Well, okay.

51:51.667 --> 51:53.000
So we agree to the terms?

51:53.000 --> 51:54.458
Where do I sign?

52:01.125 --> 52:02.917
Anywhere else I need to sign?

52:06.167 --> 52:07.792
Initial here.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.542
Anywhere else I need to initial?

52:12.958 --> 52:16.583
We gotta make sure
this document is air tight.

52:26.417 --> 52:30.292
The Freudian concepts
of the Id and the Superego are,

52:30.292 --> 52:34.083
in Jung's point of view,
in constant struggle with each other.

52:35.292 --> 52:36.917
The Superego

52:36.917 --> 52:38.500
<i>is our conscience.</i>

52:38.500 --> 52:40.583
<i>It rewards us for behaving properly,</i>

52:40.583 --> 52:44.083
<i>adhering to societal norms,
moralistic standards.</i>

52:47.292 --> 52:48.833
So, the Id...

52:49.542 --> 52:51.167
<i>as humans, we have desires,</i>

52:51.167 --> 52:53.208
<i>instincts that are primitive.</i>

52:55.292 --> 52:58.250
<i>Urges that are solely based
in the pursuit of pleasure,</i>

52:58.250 --> 53:01.042
ignoring the consequences.

53:01.042 --> 53:02.125
Now, the Ego

53:02.125 --> 53:04.333
<i>is the middle-man.</i>

53:04.333 --> 53:07.583
<i>The bridge between instinct and logic,</i>

53:07.583 --> 53:09.417
<i>the law and the lawless.</i>

53:09.417 --> 53:11.917
<i>Forever attempting to maximize pleasure</i>

53:11.917 --> 53:14.500
<i>while minimizing the cost.</i>

53:25.125 --> 53:27.250
Welcome to Madison Airlines.

53:30.375 --> 53:31.833
Where we flying?

53:31.833 --> 53:34.708
Somewhere hot and tropical.

53:38.042 --> 53:39.917
Please follow me to the upper deck.

53:41.083 --> 53:42.583
First class all the way.

53:42.583 --> 53:43.875
Shh.

53:44.708 --> 53:48.292
Sir, please unbuckle your seatbelt.

53:48.292 --> 53:49.917
It's for your own safety.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.458
We're expecting heavy turbulence...

54:01.083 --> 54:03.083
So prepare to brace for impact.

54:31.292 --> 54:34.792
I know we agreed not to
talk about stuff like this,

54:34.792 --> 54:36.917
and you don't have to answer
if you don't want to,

54:36.917 --> 54:42.375
but how do you do it and not get caught?

54:45.125 --> 54:49.208
Well, you gotta be smart, thorough,

54:49.208 --> 54:52.208
a few steps ahead of what you know
they're going to be looking for.

54:53.250 --> 54:56.167
You know, the dirty secret is,
most murders go unsolved,

54:56.167 --> 54:57.667
especially around here.

54:57.667 --> 55:02.583
So, my M.O., engage
in a more controlled area,

55:02.583 --> 55:07.083
and then move the body
somewhere that says, "chaos."

55:07.083 --> 55:08.375
Isn't that messy?

55:08.375 --> 55:11.458
Well, it can be if you're not smart.

55:11.458 --> 55:14.208
Quick, you're going to shoot me. Where?

55:16.417 --> 55:18.083
No! Lower.

55:18.083 --> 55:19.250
Lower.

55:19.250 --> 55:21.458
Lo-- okay.

55:23.958 --> 55:25.208
The heart.

55:27.542 --> 55:31.583
I mean, certain areas
like the head or the neck,

55:31.583 --> 55:34.542
I mean, the blood
has nowhere to go but out.

55:34.542 --> 55:36.625
Talk about a bloody mess.

55:36.625 --> 55:39.917
And people, I mean, we're just
these big skin-bags of blood,

55:39.917 --> 55:42.542
and you have this big
beautiful thoracic cavity

55:42.542 --> 55:44.125
to hold it all in.

55:47.417 --> 55:49.417
Until you can move the body,

55:49.417 --> 55:50.792
set the scene,

55:52.125 --> 55:54.042
tell the story you want them to find.

55:58.042 --> 56:00.542
<i>You know, I was always too shy
to go out for the high school play,</i>

56:00.542 --> 56:03.458
<i>but I had somehow found my stage,</i>

56:03.458 --> 56:06.333
<i>and each arrest was like
a standing ovation.</i>

56:06.333 --> 56:09.292
We're about to go
into the deep end of the pool here.

56:10.875 --> 56:12.375
This is serious.

56:13.625 --> 56:16.542
If I take this envelope and leave,

56:16.542 --> 56:21.542
this time tomorrow, her head
is in a Winn-Dixie bag.

56:21.542 --> 56:24.458
The rest of her is pig slop in Opelousas.

56:25.667 --> 56:28.250
Now be absolutely clear with me.

56:29.375 --> 56:31.333
Is that what you want?

56:32.000 --> 56:35.250
Alright. I got this woman.
She's into this iPhone swiping.

56:35.250 --> 56:36.750
This boyfriend findin', right?

56:36.750 --> 56:38.583
And she's slingin' the kitty
across the causeway

56:38.583 --> 56:41.500
with this manager from the Piccadilly,
and then wanna take everything, too.

56:41.500 --> 56:45.458
Now, I don't know how things work
where you from, but from around here,

56:45.458 --> 56:49.083
you don't take a man TV,
his dog, and his boat.

56:49.083 --> 56:50.583
There's no way, T.

56:53.083 --> 56:54.083
Kill the slut.

56:55.042 --> 56:56.542
With pleasure.

57:03.542 --> 57:05.458
Your Honor,

57:05.458 --> 57:09.750
a psychopathic predator
will always be a threat to society.

57:09.750 --> 57:14.125
On the other hand, someone
who once commits a crime of passion,

57:14.125 --> 57:16.500
or sudden passion, as it is known legally,

57:16.500 --> 57:20.833
is no more likely to commit that crime
than any other member of society.

57:21.625 --> 57:24.000
In this case, I would characterize

57:24.000 --> 57:27.792
just the intent to entertain
solicitation of murder,

57:27.792 --> 57:31.958
although no one was ultimately harmed,
as kind of a "sudden passion"

57:31.958 --> 57:34.583
as opposed to attempted
pre-meditated murder.

57:34.583 --> 57:35.875
Objection!

57:35.875 --> 57:37.208
Overruled.

57:37.208 --> 57:39.167
A question would be welcome.

57:39.167 --> 57:43.125
Mr. Johnson, you testified previously

57:43.125 --> 57:46.208
that you felt this was
a pre-meditated act.

57:46.208 --> 57:49.042
By that, did you mean
you conjuring this whole thing

57:49.042 --> 57:51.958
and coercing them into a murder scheme
was premeditated?

57:52.833 --> 57:56.417
There was nothing sudden
or impulsive about our meeting.

57:56.417 --> 58:01.125
The intent was clear.
The follow-through was detailed.

58:01.125 --> 58:05.333
Well, if you were not
attempting coercion, why the research?

58:05.333 --> 58:09.375
Why the costumes? Why the disguises?

58:09.375 --> 58:13.125
Sure, my client has found himself
in compromising circumstances,

58:13.125 --> 58:17.208
but my question to you, Mr. Johnson,
what are your circumstances?

58:17.208 --> 58:18.542
Objection, your honor!

58:18.542 --> 58:19.958
Sustained.

58:19.958 --> 58:22.333
What are you hiding with these costumes?

58:22.333 --> 58:23.708
Who are you trying to fool?

58:23.708 --> 58:24.792
<i>What would Ron do?</i>

58:24.792 --> 58:27.083
Objection, the defense
is badgering the witness.

58:27.083 --> 58:29.875
My job is not to analyze
the events around my meeting.

58:29.875 --> 58:33.000
My job is to meet the client
at those circumstances.

58:33.000 --> 58:36.458
Complete the picture
they've already drawn for themselves.

58:37.167 --> 58:40.000
I'm not in the business of second chances.

58:45.292 --> 58:47.625
I got something we can play with.

58:47.625 --> 58:49.417
I like the sound of that.

58:49.417 --> 58:50.542
What do you got back there?

58:50.542 --> 58:51.625
Pick a hand.

58:52.958 --> 58:53.833
Left.

58:53.833 --> 58:55.458
- You lose.
- Whoa.

58:55.458 --> 58:56.667
Shit.

58:57.542 --> 58:58.625
What is that for?

59:00.208 --> 59:02.833
Well, what do you think?
I'm a woman living by myself.

59:02.833 --> 59:04.250
I gotta protect myself.

59:04.250 --> 59:07.208
Plus, all that talk about murder
freaked me out.

59:07.917 --> 59:08.833
Okay.

59:08.833 --> 59:11.917
Trust me, that is not gonna be
making you any safer.

59:12.500 --> 59:13.417
You have a gun.

59:14.833 --> 59:17.000
It's a little different.
I'm a professional.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.417
Mm.

59:18.917 --> 59:21.958
Well, are you going to show me
how to use it or what?

59:21.958 --> 59:24.333
- Now?
- Mm-hmm.

59:25.167 --> 59:26.917
Didn't we have a contract?

59:26.917 --> 59:29.208
Nothing outside of here matters?

59:31.458 --> 59:34.042
We have to leave
our love nest at some point.

59:34.542 --> 59:35.375
Don't we?

59:36.333 --> 59:37.375
Do we?

59:46.917 --> 59:48.167
Okay. I suck.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.167
Self-healing targets.

59:50.167 --> 59:52.042
Why is this so hard?

59:52.042 --> 59:53.167
Ah, it just takes practice.

59:53.167 --> 59:55.250
Why don't you show me, hot shot?

59:58.125 --> 59:59.792
Well, this distance

59:59.792 --> 01:00:02.792
is for weekenders, tourists...

01:00:10.625 --> 01:00:12.250
That's my usual distance.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:20.042
Okay, wait. Just hear me out.

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:23.375
So, if the moon controls the tides, right?

01:00:23.375 --> 01:00:25.375
- Yeah.
- And we're mostly water,

01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:27.583
how could a full moon not affect you?

01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.583
Think about it.

01:00:29.583 --> 01:00:31.833
Well, technically, that makes no sense.

01:00:31.833 --> 01:00:34.083
- No, it makes sense.
- No.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:37.458
A phase of the moon
has nothing to do with gravity.

01:00:37.458 --> 01:00:39.042
It has to do with shadows.

01:00:39.042 --> 01:00:40.750
A phase is just
how much of the sun's light

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:42.417
we're blocking on the way to the moon.

01:00:42.417 --> 01:00:45.792
You know, the gravitational relationship
between the moon and Earth,

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:47.583
these two planetary bodies, is fixed

01:00:47.583 --> 01:00:50.042
so the moon may look different
throughout the month,

01:00:50.042 --> 01:00:53.292
but nothing is actually
changing on Earth, you know?

01:00:53.292 --> 01:00:57.917
Okay, I didn't know I was out
with Neil fuckin' DeGrasse Tyson.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.125
Gotta keep you guessin'.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:03.042
- Let's go dance, white boy.
- Yeah.

01:01:38.292 --> 01:01:40.333
Let's go, get the fuck out of here.

01:01:46.667 --> 01:01:48.917
Ray. Come on, man.

01:01:48.917 --> 01:01:50.708
Madison?

01:01:50.708 --> 01:01:52.000
Fuck...

01:01:53.792 --> 01:01:55.875
- I've been calling you.
- Ray, please.

01:01:55.875 --> 01:01:57.833
Guess your hands have been
too busy to pick up, huh?

01:01:59.667 --> 01:02:00.875
Who the fuck is this?

01:02:02.042 --> 01:02:03.125
I'm her boyfriend.

01:02:03.708 --> 01:02:06.125
Oh, really? Well, I'm her husband.

01:02:06.125 --> 01:02:08.375
- Ray, can we just please keep it--
- What? Keep it what, Maddy?

01:02:08.375 --> 01:02:10.167
No, you tell me. You tell me, Maddy.

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:11.708
- You want me to keep it cordial?
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:11.708 --> 01:02:13.000
Yeah, you, too, boyfriend!

01:02:13.875 --> 01:02:15.417
Madison, you're pathetic!

01:02:16.125 --> 01:02:17.833
- Hey, you know what? No.
- Ray. Ray!

01:02:17.833 --> 01:02:21.083
No, I'm not done, okay?
Just get the fuck off me.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:23.000
I'm just fuckin' around, guys.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.292
Come on!

01:02:24.292 --> 01:02:27.542
Is it a crime now to have a little fun
with your new friend here?

01:02:27.542 --> 01:02:29.333
Ray, can you just leave us alone?

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:31.250
Goddamn it, Madison.
Don't walk away from me.

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:33.292
- Ray.
- Don't you fucking walk away from me,

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:35.500
you ungrateful bitch! Come here!

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.792
- Shit!
- Apologize, motherfucker.

01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:40.208
Yeah. He said apologize, motherfucker.

01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:43.375
He's a professional. He'll do it.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:44.750
Show him.

01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:49.125
Fuck.

01:02:52.958 --> 01:02:54.083
Come on.

01:02:54.625 --> 01:02:55.708
Professional what?

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:59.167
Yeah. Professional asshole.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Really moving up in the world,
aren't you, Madison, huh?

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.458
- See you again, professional.
- Come on, Ray, get outta here.

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:08.458
You know what? Fuck y'all.
You fuckin' deserve each other.

01:03:08.458 --> 01:03:10.875
- Ray, c'mon, dude! Get the fuck out of--
- Shut the fuck up!

01:03:10.875 --> 01:03:12.250
Not fucking cool man!

01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:16.625
I can't get over how amazing that was!

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:20.417
You... you were incredible.

01:03:20.417 --> 01:03:23.750
That entitled fuck doesn't
back down for anybody.

01:03:24.792 --> 01:03:26.792
Did you see his face?

01:03:26.792 --> 01:03:29.667
- Yeah...
- He just walked.

01:03:33.458 --> 01:03:35.250
That was wild.

01:03:37.917 --> 01:03:39.292
All right, cool guy.

01:03:39.292 --> 01:03:44.708
Nobody, nobody has ever
stood up for me like that.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.208
Well.

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:54.750
Here.

01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.000
Best date ever.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.500
Oh.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.875
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:04.042
That's good.

01:04:04.042 --> 01:04:05.750
Oh, that is so good.

01:04:06.542 --> 01:04:11.667
So, it seems like you and Ray
have different takes on your divorce.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:13.958
I'm clear.

01:04:13.958 --> 01:04:16.167
I mean, I can't help it
if he's being all crazy.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.667
I mean, you saw how crazy he is.

01:04:17.667 --> 01:04:18.792
Yeah.

01:04:20.583 --> 01:04:22.667
You are divorced, though, right?

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:26.208
Do you see a ring on my finger?

01:04:27.292 --> 01:04:29.125
Do you see a ring on my finger?

01:04:29.708 --> 01:04:30.792
No.

01:04:30.792 --> 01:04:32.125
Exactly.

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:37.125
I mean, it's just like,
what are the chances

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.833
that the same club we're at
is the same club he's at?

01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:41.917
Okay, what's up with all these questions?

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:45.000
Fine!

01:04:46.458 --> 01:04:47.667
I fucked up.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:50.125
I broke our contract.

01:04:53.917 --> 01:04:59.708
But I will happily, happily sign
a new one when we get home...

01:05:09.792 --> 01:05:11.250
All right. Well, you seem upset.

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:16.042
I'm not upset
with me pulling a gun on some dickhead.

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:17.833
It's not a big deal.

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:20.542
I'm just saying,
you don't see me bringing you

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.667
to where all my friends and
former lovers are hanging out.

01:05:22.667 --> 01:05:24.500
We just gotta keep this clean.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.625
It was a coincidence!

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:29.625
Whoa. What the fuck?

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.792
Looky who's here.

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:33.583
I thought that was you.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:38.292
What's up?

01:05:38.292 --> 01:05:40.333
Oh, I'm just grabbing some takeout.

01:05:40.333 --> 01:05:43.167
Saw you across the way. I mean, what, huh?

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:45.542
What are the odds of this? This is crazy.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:48.583
Are you gonna introduce me to your friend?

01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:54.667
- Jasper.
- Madison.

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:56.250
Madison.

01:05:56.250 --> 01:05:57.667
Madison?

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.208
Madison...

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:04.292
Have we met before?
You just look so familiar.

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:06.083
No.

01:06:06.083 --> 01:06:08.167
No, I don't think so.

01:06:11.292 --> 01:06:13.917
Ugh. Whatever. Maybe it'll come to me...

01:06:13.917 --> 01:06:15.833
Maybe it will.

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:19.417
Okay. Well, I'll let you guys
get back to your dessert.

01:06:19.417 --> 01:06:20.917
Just wanted to say hi.

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:23.167
Have a good night.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:24.917
Enjoy the weekend.

01:06:26.042 --> 01:06:27.500
Good to see ya.

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.625
All right.

01:06:28.625 --> 01:06:30.375
- Bye!
- Bye.

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:33.792
Oh.

01:06:33.792 --> 01:06:36.417
Now, that was a coincidence.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.042
Who's he?

01:06:42.792 --> 01:06:45.917
Just some guy I used to work with.

01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:54.042
So, ex-husband, ex-coworker...

01:06:55.625 --> 01:06:56.833
are we even?

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:58.625
No.

01:06:58.625 --> 01:07:00.042
Yes.

01:07:01.083 --> 01:07:02.792
I'll sign the contract again.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:19.375
What are we doing?
I got no notice. I got no research.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:20.750
Feel like I'm going in naked.

01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:23.292
Well, this is when you actually
have to be good at your job.

01:07:23.292 --> 01:07:26.125
Halloween's over.
No more costumes, man.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.458
All right. We did not get much on him.

01:07:28.458 --> 01:07:30.875
We didn't even have time
to get a Title III warrant,

01:07:30.875 --> 01:07:32.333
so it's audio only.

01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:33.708
His name is Mike.

01:07:33.708 --> 01:07:35.875
He's already in there waiting,
and he seems a little volatile.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:38.000
Woo-hoo! This is gettin' scary.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.125
Wait, do we even know
what this guy looks like?

01:07:40.125 --> 01:07:42.167
No, but he said
he'd be the guy sitting alone

01:07:42.167 --> 01:07:43.708
reading "Catcher in the Rye."

01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:46.042
Which, historically speaking,
is never a good sign.

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:47.792
It's gonna be fine, Gary.

01:07:47.792 --> 01:07:49.167
You could do this in your sleep.

01:07:49.167 --> 01:07:51.292
Just another pussy
too scared to do it himself.

01:07:51.292 --> 01:07:52.583
You got this, G.

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:55.958
Okay.

01:07:55.958 --> 01:07:57.250
Enjoy your breakfast.

01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:26.250
Mike?

01:08:26.250 --> 01:08:27.417
Yeah. Judd?

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:30.250
Eyes forward!
It's for your own protection.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:35.375
So, tell me, Mike, how can I help you?

01:08:35.958 --> 01:08:37.500
- So you're...?
- I am.

01:08:40.917 --> 01:08:41.958
And you...?

01:08:41.958 --> 01:08:43.417
I do.

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.583
So, tell me what you're thinking.

01:08:47.583 --> 01:08:49.833
Unless you came here for the pancakes.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.458
My wife.

01:08:56.125 --> 01:08:57.875
What'd you have in mind?

01:08:57.875 --> 01:09:01.667
What do you think? Slut's killing me.

01:09:02.958 --> 01:09:05.292
I can't live just knowing she's out there...

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.875
with someone else.

01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:13.167
So, now I'm here... with you.

01:09:14.958 --> 01:09:17.500
So why do you need me?

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:20.000
Why aren't you taking care
of this shit yourself?

01:09:20.625 --> 01:09:22.417
Oh, believe me, I want to,

01:09:23.708 --> 01:09:27.125
but we're going through
a divorce right now.

01:09:27.958 --> 01:09:30.042
And I'd be the number one suspect.

01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:35.000
So, I need the perfect front,
you know, the perfect alibi.

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.292
So, you're not technically divorced yet?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:43.667
What's it to you?

01:09:45.250 --> 01:09:47.167
Oh, I forgot to mention, too. It's...

01:09:47.167 --> 01:09:49.792
Well, it might be a twofer.

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:51.750
She's got this new boyfriend.

01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:54.250
He's a real douche.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:57.917
And?

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:02.083
And, if he's there,
you can take him out, too.

01:10:05.125 --> 01:10:07.083
I've got no problem with that.

01:10:07.083 --> 01:10:08.708
It's gonna cost you more.

01:10:08.708 --> 01:10:10.167
You good with it?

01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:12.750
Yeah, fuck em' both.

01:10:13.875 --> 01:10:15.000
Done.

01:10:15.792 --> 01:10:16.958
You bring the money?

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:20.875
Yeah, it's right here.
Should be enough for both of them.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:28.000
I have a special request, though.

01:10:30.458 --> 01:10:32.167
I'm in the service business.

01:10:36.625 --> 01:10:40.583
When you do it, I want her to know why.

01:10:41.958 --> 01:10:46.792
Right before you do it,
look her in the eye and say,

01:10:46.792 --> 01:10:48.875
"This is from your loving husband."

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:54.792
I want that to be the last thing
she fuckin' hears.

01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.583
You know what?

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:05.917
Maybe I'll throw in
the boyfriend for free.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.375
What the fuck?

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:10.750
What? It's very simple.

01:11:10.750 --> 01:11:13.417
You give me the money.
I'll take care of it.

01:11:14.625 --> 01:11:16.417
I'll take care of this shit myself.

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:21.417
What the hell was that about?

01:11:21.417 --> 01:11:24.375
I don't know. He just freaked out.

01:11:24.375 --> 01:11:25.917
Happens...

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:27.417
Does it?

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:33.667
<i>...right now. But leave a message.</i>

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:37.542
All right. Madison,
if you get this, stay out of the house.

01:11:37.542 --> 01:11:39.667
All right? I'm hearing some stuff
about Ray. Just call--

01:11:42.667 --> 01:11:43.750
What the fuck was that?

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.208
- What?
- What?

01:11:45.208 --> 01:11:48.292
What do you mean what?
The guy just bolts out?

01:11:48.292 --> 01:11:50.667
I don't know. He panicked.

01:11:50.667 --> 01:11:52.042
Well, you can't win 'em all.

01:11:52.042 --> 01:11:55.458
No, you sure can't with that attitude.
If they're uneasy, you put 'em at ease.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:58.292
From my perspective,
you're getting a little sloppy.

01:12:00.708 --> 01:12:02.083
Maybe so.

01:12:04.292 --> 01:12:08.250
Look, I wanted to talk with you
about the other night...

01:12:09.083 --> 01:12:11.667
Oh? What about it?

01:12:14.292 --> 01:12:15.250
Oh, her?

01:12:15.250 --> 01:12:18.458
Hey, I get it, man.
It all makes sense to me now.

01:12:18.458 --> 01:12:20.542
It's cool.

01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:22.417
I've fucked my share of suspects.

01:12:22.417 --> 01:12:25.792
It's no big deal. It's good for ya.

01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:28.833
I just ran into her. All right?

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:31.042
She was just thanking me
for steering her in the right direction.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:33.833
Uh huh, I bet she was.

01:12:35.833 --> 01:12:38.750
I just don't want things
to get misconstrued.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:39.792
Gary...

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:42.667
you can trust me.

01:12:45.250 --> 01:12:46.708
Wait, wait...

01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:50.583
Just tell me this one more time.
He's trying to put out a hit on me?

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:53.083
Yes! He's trying to hire me to kill you!

01:12:53.083 --> 01:12:55.083
What do you not get
about that? We gotta go.

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.958
- And he saw you in person?
- Yeah.

01:12:58.833 --> 01:13:01.458
- And he knows what you do?
- Yeah.

01:13:03.458 --> 01:13:04.792
So, are you gonna kill me?

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:08.208
What are you talking about?

01:13:08.792 --> 01:13:10.667
Are you gonna kill me?

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.125
No.

01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:16.750
Then I have nothing to worry about.

01:13:21.667 --> 01:13:23.458
I think he might do it himself.

01:13:23.458 --> 01:13:25.167
No, he won't.

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:27.708
He won't. He won't.

01:13:28.958 --> 01:13:33.417
Okay. So, I ask the modern-day jury,
what is your verdict?

01:13:35.708 --> 01:13:38.542
We've decided on life without parole.

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.583
How very modern of you.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:43.583
How did you arrive at this conclusion?

01:13:43.583 --> 01:13:47.667
Well, even though we felt this person
is guilty of a heinous act,

01:13:47.667 --> 01:13:50.708
we don't think a state-sanctioned killing
accomplishes anything,

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:53.292
and only causes more pain and suffering.

01:13:53.292 --> 01:13:54.250
Okay.

01:13:54.917 --> 01:13:57.000
It's a nice example of a legal system

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.458
set up to respond
to the will of its citizens.

01:14:00.042 --> 01:14:04.542
Now, let's jump back in time
to our Paleolithic friends,

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:08.042
25,000 years ago,
where things are very different.

01:14:08.042 --> 01:14:09.458
You have no jury.

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:11.417
You have no official legal system.

01:14:11.417 --> 01:14:13.750
You're just a nomadic community.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.625
So, what are you gonna do
about your problem,

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:20.542
this existential threat
in the form of your unhinged leader

01:14:20.542 --> 01:14:21.917
who's invading other tribes?

01:14:21.917 --> 01:14:24.792
He's killing. He's raping. He's pillaging.

01:14:24.792 --> 01:14:27.708
Seems like he's gonna get you all killed.

01:14:27.708 --> 01:14:29.708
What are your options?

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:31.708
We're kinda mixed.

01:14:31.708 --> 01:14:33.458
Some of us think we should exile him--

01:14:33.458 --> 01:14:36.333
We don't have the means to exile him.
We gonna put him on a boat?

01:14:36.333 --> 01:14:37.667
The majority of us...

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:40.417
want to eliminate him.

01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:43.375
Whatever we have to do
for our own survival.

01:14:44.083 --> 01:14:46.958
- Whoo. Don't mess with Jerren.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.625
So, how do you solve this problem?

01:14:48.625 --> 01:14:50.000
Execution.

01:14:50.792 --> 01:14:52.250
That's ruthless,

01:14:53.292 --> 01:14:56.458
but historically,
potentially the right choice.

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:59.500
There's been a lot of scholarship
on this very subject recently.

01:14:59.500 --> 01:15:02.917
And the new thinking is
that these kind of targeted killings

01:15:02.917 --> 01:15:06.625
actually play a larger part in our
social evolution than previously thought.

01:15:06.625 --> 01:15:11.208
This impulse to weed out
these destabilizing forces

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:15.917
is likely a dark thread
in our historical DNA.

01:15:15.917 --> 01:15:18.333
These killings were thought
to have served a twofold purpose.

01:15:18.333 --> 01:15:21.417
They not only protected
social coherence and norms,

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:25.250
but also eliminated
a certain kind of abusive

01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:27.542
and uncooperative person
from the gene pool.

01:15:27.542 --> 01:15:29.958
Excuse me. When did our professor get hot?

01:15:29.958 --> 01:15:31.250
I know.

01:15:31.958 --> 01:15:34.583
And you'll get those comp stats
over to Headquarters this afternoon?

01:15:34.583 --> 01:15:36.000
Mm-hmm.

01:15:38.458 --> 01:15:39.875
They know about the body?

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:41.875
No. I haven't had a chance
to tell them yet.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.292
What body?

01:15:43.292 --> 01:15:44.375
You remember the lady came in,

01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:46.417
trying to have her husband
killed, that we let go?

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.083
No, that he let go.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:50.500
Madison Figueroa Masters.

01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.000
Ah, the one you were Ron.

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.125
Yeah, her husband was just found dead.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.625
I'm sorry. What happened? Where?

01:15:58.625 --> 01:16:01.708
The body was found
in Cabbage Alley off Chef Menteur.

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:03.250
Possible drug deal gone bad.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.250
Single bullet to the aorta. A .38.

01:16:14.458 --> 01:16:15.292
Gary?

01:16:18.292 --> 01:16:20.583
Yeah. When I was researching our guy,

01:16:20.583 --> 01:16:23.750
seemed like he had
a lot of drug problems, so...

01:16:26.125 --> 01:16:27.542
Any suspects?

01:16:27.542 --> 01:16:29.833
Not really. Sounds like
she and the husband got into it

01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:31.625
outside of a bar called Virgo's,

01:16:31.625 --> 01:16:33.708
and then the guy she was with
pulled a gun on him.

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:36.958
Did we ID that guy?

01:16:37.542 --> 01:16:38.500
Not yet.

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:45.167
Maybe it's a new boyfriend or something?

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:49.125
Should we go
try to find this guy, talk to him?

01:16:49.125 --> 01:16:50.792
I'm liking that.

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:52.250
Let us know what you find out.

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:56.083
I think Johnson and I
should tag-team this.

01:16:56.083 --> 01:16:58.375
Is that all right if I bring him?

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.083
Sure.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.708
Are you cool with it, Gary?

01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:05.708
Yeah.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:35.375
What are you doing?

01:17:35.375 --> 01:17:37.292
Looking for the boyfriend.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.167
Oh, shit! I found him!

01:17:45.167 --> 01:17:46.833
Fuck! I'm good.

01:17:46.833 --> 01:17:49.292
Come on! What are we doing here?

01:17:49.292 --> 01:17:52.583
Hey. Look, I'm not going to tell anybody.

01:17:52.583 --> 01:17:53.708
Tell 'em what?

01:17:53.708 --> 01:17:56.000
So, I ran into her again.
Doesn't mean I'm the boyfriend.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:57.750
Doesn't mean I have
anything to do with anything.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.083
Whoa, whoa.

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:01.250
Whoa. So defensive.

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:04.167
Look, nobody's accusing you of anything.

01:18:04.167 --> 01:18:08.500
I was just wondering if you knew this guy?

01:18:09.417 --> 01:18:10.875
If he looked familiar?

01:18:13.042 --> 01:18:16.167
Yeah, that was the guy
that ran out of the restaurant.

01:18:16.167 --> 01:18:18.333
What was his name? Mike?

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:21.542
Ray. He's Madison's husband.

01:18:21.542 --> 01:18:22.667
Right?

01:18:25.125 --> 01:18:26.292
Right.

01:18:27.708 --> 01:18:30.542
You see, I went back and listened
to that conversation that you guys had,

01:18:30.542 --> 01:18:36.083
and it just took on a whole different
layer of meaning for me.

01:18:36.083 --> 01:18:40.417
You really knew what button to push
with that whole boyfriend line, huh?

01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:41.333
Huh?

01:18:41.333 --> 01:18:43.167
What are you getting at?

01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:47.958
Nothing. It's just...

01:18:47.958 --> 01:18:50.542
Hey, look, we're friends, right, Gary?

01:18:50.542 --> 01:18:52.333
Let you in on something.

01:18:52.333 --> 01:18:57.125
Over the years,
I've sort of learned to follow my nose

01:18:57.125 --> 01:19:01.708
on these hunches that I have, and usually
something turns up pretty interesting.

01:19:03.292 --> 01:19:04.542
Valuable.

01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:06.500
Let me know what you find.

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:09.875
Maybe.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.958
All right. Well...

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:15.958
I don't know. Nothing here.

01:19:22.417 --> 01:19:23.833
You scared me.

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.292
Hi.

01:19:29.292 --> 01:19:31.000
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.625
Like what?

01:19:33.625 --> 01:19:36.125
You're looking at me
like something's wrong.

01:19:36.125 --> 01:19:38.000
Is something wrong?

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:42.083
Anything out of the ordinary?

01:19:42.875 --> 01:19:44.542
Okay, what are you doing?

01:19:44.542 --> 01:19:46.583
Look, Ron, it's too early for this shit.

01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:48.208
Did you hear about Ray?

01:19:50.792 --> 01:19:52.625
That he's dead?

01:19:52.625 --> 01:19:53.750
Yeah.

01:19:54.958 --> 01:19:56.417
How do you know about that?

01:19:56.417 --> 01:19:57.875
I just know.

01:19:58.958 --> 01:20:03.542
Were you ever going to tell me?
You just didn't think it would come up?

01:20:03.542 --> 01:20:05.250
Yeah, but who told you?

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.958
This is sort of my area.

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.333
You know, I listen to police scanners.

01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.625
I tend to know
who's being killed in this town.

01:20:15.458 --> 01:20:18.333
I'm wondering if you're okay
'cause you seem weirdly okay.

01:20:18.333 --> 01:20:20.292
I was obviously going to tell you.

01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:25.875
It's just that I'm still
just processing it all.

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.333
I don't really know what to do with it.

01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:33.458
You know, it's a weird position to be in.

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:36.375
Am I supposed to be playing
the role of a grieving widow?

01:20:36.375 --> 01:20:39.625
Well, I don't know how to pretend.

01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:43.000
Was he a good guy? No.

01:20:43.792 --> 01:20:47.083
Did I love him?
I mean, I loved him.

01:20:48.625 --> 01:20:51.000
Just-- people grieve in different ways.

01:20:53.208 --> 01:20:57.042
I just have to know.
Did you have anything to do with this?

01:20:57.042 --> 01:21:00.458
Why the fuck would I have
anything to do with this?

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:02.375
What motive? You think--

01:21:02.375 --> 01:21:05.708
I'm the one who talked you out of
killing him in the first place, remember?

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.542
What, you think
I'm just out there on my own

01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:09.042
killing people for no money?

01:21:09.042 --> 01:21:10.542
Okay.

01:21:12.167 --> 01:21:13.708
I just had to ask.

01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:19.125
I'm sorry.

01:21:22.708 --> 01:21:24.292
It's okay. I'm--

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:27.375
I understand.

01:21:34.083 --> 01:21:35.417
Come here.

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:40.542
I'm really happy you're here.

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:41.833
Me, too.

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:46.292
So, what happened?

01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:48.083
Police call you to let you know?

01:21:48.083 --> 01:21:50.125
Yeah.

01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:53.333
And what are they saying?
Any suspects? Arrests?

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:58.667
They think there was a drug deal going on.
They just found him shot.

01:22:02.208 --> 01:22:03.708
I'm so scared.

01:22:03.708 --> 01:22:05.708
I know.

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.208
It's so weird,

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.833
so out of the blue.

01:22:14.542 --> 01:22:17.375
But you don't have to be scared.
Why would you be scared?

01:22:20.667 --> 01:22:22.083
Because I killed him.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:30.375
You killed him?

01:22:30.958 --> 01:22:31.875
Yeah.

01:22:34.167 --> 01:22:36.125
- Why would you do that?

01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:39.708
You told me yourself.
He was gonna come and kill me!

01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:43.708
So, he was attacking you.
It was like self-defense.

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:47.250
- Technically...
- Technically, what? What was he doing?

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.958
He was either passed out or asleep.

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.417
And you killed him?

01:22:53.417 --> 01:22:54.667
Yeah.

01:22:54.667 --> 01:22:57.167
I made a story, and they're believing it.

01:22:57.167 --> 01:22:59.167
Oh, my God...

01:22:59.167 --> 01:23:02.917
Oh, my God!

01:23:03.875 --> 01:23:05.667
Why are you getting
so worked up about this?

01:23:05.667 --> 01:23:07.708
- You do this shit all the time.
- I don't do this all the time.

01:23:07.708 --> 01:23:10.333
I've never done this.
I've never killed anyone.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.708
What are you talking about?

01:23:12.708 --> 01:23:14.167
I'm a fake hitman.

01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:20.958
That's why I didn't put you away.
I didn't have you arrested.

01:23:20.958 --> 01:23:24.583
Because I was working undercover.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.125
You're a cop?

01:23:26.125 --> 01:23:27.833
No. I--

01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:33.792
I teach at a college.
This hitman thing's just a part-time gig

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:35.542
that's gotten out of hand.

01:23:35.542 --> 01:23:38.167
So, you've been lying to me
this whole time?

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:43.417
I was stuck.

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:48.375
I didn't want to lose you,
and you met Ron first.

01:23:48.375 --> 01:23:50.167
And you liked Ron...

01:23:50.917 --> 01:23:54.250
I liked Ron.
So, I didn't want to show you Gary.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.958
Who the fuck is Gary?

01:23:56.958 --> 01:23:57.875
I'm Gary.

01:23:58.708 --> 01:24:00.208
I don't even know your name?

01:24:00.208 --> 01:24:02.042
My real name is Gary Johnson.

01:24:03.792 --> 01:24:05.833
- Gary?
- I know!

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.042
- Oh.
- Sorry.

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:11.250
- They've called three times.
- Oh.

01:24:12.042 --> 01:24:15.875
Something must be going on.
A situation probably...

01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:17.458
Hey, how's it going, Claude?

01:24:17.458 --> 01:24:20.625
<i>Gary, where are you?
We need you back at the station now.</i>

01:24:20.625 --> 01:24:22.792
- Now?
<i>- Yes, now.</i>

01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:25.292
<i>We got a new development
on this Madison Masters.</i>

01:24:27.917 --> 01:24:29.833
Okay. I'll be right there.

01:24:30.792 --> 01:24:32.292
I'm sorry.

01:24:32.292 --> 01:24:35.625
I gotta handle something really quickly,
and then I'm gonna be right back...

01:24:35.625 --> 01:24:36.708
Don't.

01:24:38.083 --> 01:24:41.458
Just leave, whatever your name is.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:47.958
<i>I might have walked in as Ron,
but I left as Gary.</i>

01:24:52.917 --> 01:24:55.042
Johnson's here! Phil, briefing room.

01:24:57.875 --> 01:24:59.667
Wait 'til you hear this.

01:24:59.667 --> 01:25:02.000
Hey! Lookin' good, Gary.

01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:10.458
Glad you could make it.

01:25:12.833 --> 01:25:15.833
This is looking more and more
like we messed this up.

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:19.083
Madison Figueroa
is now the number one suspect.

01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:21.958
- Really?
- Really.

01:25:22.542 --> 01:25:23.500
Have a seat.

01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:27.417
Tell him what we just found out.

01:25:27.417 --> 01:25:28.458
About six months ago,

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:31.125
Ray Masters increased
his life insurance policy

01:25:31.125 --> 01:25:32.792
by one million dollars.

01:25:33.833 --> 01:25:38.125
A policy in which, of course,
the wife was named the sole beneficiary.

01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:39.083
Hm.

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:41.792
Now, the policy pre-dates
the initial solicitation attempt,

01:25:41.792 --> 01:25:44.875
but Homicide now believes there might be
some connective tissue here.

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:47.958
Maybe after your meeting,
she coerced someone else to do it,

01:25:47.958 --> 01:25:49.292
or she did it herself.

01:25:49.292 --> 01:25:50.708
That's what happens
when you let someone off the hook.

01:25:50.708 --> 01:25:51.833
Not helpful.

01:25:51.833 --> 01:25:53.708
And that was a long time ago.

01:25:55.958 --> 01:26:00.000
Gary, did you ever talk to her again
after that time at the Please U?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.458
Yeah. Actually, I did.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.750
You did? When?

01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:07.875
Yeah, I ran into her at Ted's Frostop.

01:26:07.875 --> 01:26:11.083
She just thanked me for helping her out,
giving her good advice.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.708
Actually, that was the night
I ran into you.

01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:16.167
You talked to her.

01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:19.500
You talked to her, too?

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:24.500
I didn't realize that was her.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:26.583
Yeah, that was Madison.

01:26:27.167 --> 01:26:28.000
Huh.

01:26:29.375 --> 01:26:30.417
Huh.

01:26:30.417 --> 01:26:33.750
So, do you think she could be
involved in his murder?

01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:38.500
I mean, there's always a chance,
but I would be very surprised.

01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:42.458
She just seemed so happy.
She left her husband.

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:43.917
She got her own place.

01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:47.667
And just seemed like
she was doing really well.

01:26:50.208 --> 01:26:52.125
So, what are we doin' next here, guys?

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:57.583
Well, we could pull her in
for questioning at any time.

01:26:57.583 --> 01:26:59.958
She'll probably
just get a lawyer, clam up...

01:26:59.958 --> 01:27:01.458
and if she's really behind this,

01:27:01.458 --> 01:27:04.375
she's probably got her lies
and alibis in order. You know.

01:27:04.375 --> 01:27:08.375
I'm thinking we got a one-time opportunity
to get the unvarnished story from her.

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:12.375
This guy.

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:14.750
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:27:16.208 --> 01:27:20.917
Question, when you ran into her,

01:27:20.917 --> 01:27:23.417
were you Gary, or were you the hitman?

01:27:23.417 --> 01:27:25.750
Which one were you
going under on that one?

01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:27.208
Ron.

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:30.458
Okay, so you're still
Ron, the hitman, to her?

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.875
Who else would I be?

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.667
This is great.
I mean, look, she forever knows

01:27:38.667 --> 01:27:41.833
that he knows
that she wanted to kill the guy,

01:27:41.833 --> 01:27:45.708
and she must like him or trust him enough

01:27:45.708 --> 01:27:48.708
to be sharing a sundae at Ted's Frostop.

01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:52.458
I mean, let's face it, huh?
They got the goods on each other.

01:27:52.458 --> 01:27:55.333
I mean, she would never
in a million years suspect

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:56.917
he's recording their conversation.

01:27:56.917 --> 01:27:58.958
I think we got an opportunity here.

01:28:00.917 --> 01:28:06.500
So, we manufacture a random encounter
where he gets her talking.

01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:07.708
Not random.

01:28:08.458 --> 01:28:11.208
Surprise encounter.

01:28:11.208 --> 01:28:13.708
I say we put a wire on Gary,

01:28:14.292 --> 01:28:16.167
and we go in now.

01:28:17.375 --> 01:28:22.458
Look, I'm thinking you can just
play this as a concerned check-in.

01:28:22.458 --> 01:28:25.250
You read about the husband's death,

01:28:25.250 --> 01:28:28.792
and you're up front
about why you want to talk with her.

01:28:32.333 --> 01:28:33.875
I'm liking this.

01:28:33.875 --> 01:28:37.667
There's no tellin' what she'll say,
but once you get her talking,

01:28:37.667 --> 01:28:39.708
you'll be able to tell
if she's lying to you.

01:28:39.708 --> 01:28:40.833
Exactly.

01:28:40.833 --> 01:28:42.750
You good with that, Gary?

01:28:43.333 --> 01:28:44.833
I think it's a good plan.

01:28:45.667 --> 01:28:46.792
Very good.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:49.125
So, you send me the address.

01:28:49.708 --> 01:28:51.000
I'll meet you over there.

01:28:51.667 --> 01:28:53.500
- Let's nail her.
- No, I'll ride with you.

01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:55.458
I'll get you prepped.

01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:56.917
See you guys in the van.

01:29:04.083 --> 01:29:05.250
You good?

01:29:06.625 --> 01:29:08.250
Yeah.

01:29:09.167 --> 01:29:11.083
Okay.

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:16.375
You're making me nervous.

01:29:25.667 --> 01:29:27.500
Really? Does he need that?

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.125
Yeah. I wanna be in his ear on this one.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:32.375
Go get her, Ron!

01:29:38.625 --> 01:29:39.458
Hey.

01:29:41.292 --> 01:29:42.250
I got you.

01:29:48.458 --> 01:29:49.833
You guys there?

01:29:49.833 --> 01:29:50.958
<i>Can you guys hear me?</i>

01:29:50.958 --> 01:29:52.000
Loud and clear.

01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:53.875
<i>Your ears working?</i>

01:29:53.875 --> 01:29:56.125
- Yep.
<i>- Great.</i>

01:29:56.125 --> 01:29:59.167
Remember, audio only,
gotta get a good recording.

01:29:59.167 --> 01:30:00.250
Got it.

01:30:09.042 --> 01:30:10.167
We gotta talk.

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:12.292
There's a bunch of shit coming down

01:30:12.292 --> 01:30:15.083
that we gotta figure out quick,
or we are both fucked.

01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:16.167
Wait, what?

01:30:16.167 --> 01:30:18.750
Look, people know
I handle shit around here,

01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:20.542
so because of that meeting
we had that one time,

01:30:20.542 --> 01:30:22.708
I'm catching heat
for the death of your husband.

01:30:22.708 --> 01:30:25.375
- They're thinking one of us did it.
- Well, it wasn't me!

01:30:25.375 --> 01:30:28.458
Look, I know you did it.
It's fuckin' obvious...

01:30:28.458 --> 01:30:30.167
- ...and I don't blame you.
- I didn't kill him!

01:30:30.167 --> 01:30:33.167
Wait, who's accusing me of this?

01:30:33.167 --> 01:30:34.875
This is bullshit! And you,
out of all people, should know

01:30:34.875 --> 01:30:35.958
that I wasn't capable of this!

01:30:35.958 --> 01:30:38.667
Okay, then who did?
What the hell happened?

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.208
I just know what they've told me...

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:42.875
<i>Which is what?</i>

01:30:42.875 --> 01:30:44.792
<i>He got shot buying drugs.</i>

01:30:44.792 --> 01:30:46.125
<i>Guy was an addict.</i>

01:30:46.917 --> 01:30:49.375
Okay, so you say you didn't kill him.

01:30:51.458 --> 01:30:53.125
When was the last time you saw him?

01:30:53.125 --> 01:30:55.417
Not that long ago, at Virgo's.

01:30:55.417 --> 01:30:56.417
The club?

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:59.750
Yes, the club.
I was walking out of Virgo's with this guy

01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:03.250
that I met on the dance floor,
and boom, I run into Ray.

01:31:03.250 --> 01:31:05.833
Ray loses his shit
when he sees me with this other guy,

01:31:05.833 --> 01:31:07.875
starts running his mouth,
gets all threatening,

01:31:07.875 --> 01:31:09.000
and fucking grabs me.

01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.875
And then this other guy,
trying to protect me,

01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:13.875
he pulls out a gun out of nowhere
and sticks it in Ray's face.

01:31:13.875 --> 01:31:15.958
Find out more about the guy with the gun.

01:31:15.958 --> 01:31:17.167
<i>Ray freaks out.</i>

01:31:17.167 --> 01:31:21.458
He leaves. I run away,
and that was the last time I saw him.

01:31:21.458 --> 01:31:22.958
So, who's this guy?

01:31:22.958 --> 01:31:25.500
The one who pulled the gun.
What's his name?

01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:28.667
I don't know.

01:31:28.667 --> 01:31:31.250
- You don't know his name?
- I don't know his name.

01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:33.333
We were having fun on the dance floor,

01:31:33.333 --> 01:31:36.667
and I asked him
if he wanted to go somewhere else.

01:31:36.667 --> 01:31:37.750
He said yes.

01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:40.208
We walk out,
all that stuff with Ray happened.

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:43.583
So, you know what, if he said his name,
I didn't hear it.

01:31:44.583 --> 01:31:46.250
So, you don't know his name.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:49.833
You're just leaving the club
with some random stranger you just met?

01:31:49.833 --> 01:31:51.417
Hey, fuck off!

01:31:51.417 --> 01:31:55.250
I'm a grown woman.
I'm single, and he wasn't random.

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:57.208
He was a damn good dancer.

01:31:58.333 --> 01:32:00.208
Well, I'm happy for you.

01:32:00.208 --> 01:32:02.583
'Cause your mystery man, he's a suspect.

01:32:02.583 --> 01:32:04.792
<i>I'm hearing they're looking for him.</i>

01:32:04.792 --> 01:32:06.833
Nail her on the insurance policy.

01:32:06.833 --> 01:32:09.125
Shit, well, so am I.

01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:13.042
Good men are rare these days.
He stood up for me. He protected me.

01:32:13.042 --> 01:32:16.208
So, you know what?
If they find him, you let me know.

01:32:17.083 --> 01:32:19.125
You know, that first time
we met at the Please U,

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:22.458
your motive didn't seem financial,

01:32:22.458 --> 01:32:25.250
like a lot of these other
pieces of shit I work for.

01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:26.708
Yeah, because it wasn't.

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:29.208
Then what is this
million-dollar insurance policy

01:32:29.208 --> 01:32:30.958
everybody seems to know about?

01:32:30.958 --> 01:32:33.500
Don't act like
a million dollars is nothing.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.708
Don't you fucking lie to me.
You know what I'm capable of.

01:32:40.792 --> 01:32:43.583
Ray's family has money.
They do shit like this.

01:32:43.583 --> 01:32:45.375
They take out insurance.

01:32:45.375 --> 01:32:47.625
Look, I don't even know
if I get any of that money.

01:32:47.625 --> 01:32:50.875
For all I know, he changed
the beneficiary when we broke up.

01:32:50.875 --> 01:32:53.875
Listen, I have no mind
for financial stuff.

01:32:53.875 --> 01:32:55.500
Ray would talk about money

01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:59.583
and investments and shit like that,
and it would just go over my head.

01:32:59.583 --> 01:33:02.125
Oh, you're giving me all the answers,

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:05.375
but you are not giving me
the right answers.

01:33:05.375 --> 01:33:06.750
I'm giving you the truth!

01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:08.625
I still know you did it.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:10.542
Fuck you! I didn't do it.

01:33:10.542 --> 01:33:13.583
You know what? How dare you
come into my own house and accuse me.

01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:14.958
You know what?
Get the fuck outta my house!

01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:18.250
Hey, I'm on your side.
That is why I'm here.

01:33:18.250 --> 01:33:20.583
I'm trying to help you get away with this.

01:33:20.583 --> 01:33:23.042
Not because I'm some
great guy or anything,

01:33:23.042 --> 01:33:25.417
but as soon as the heat's off you,
it's off of me, too.

01:33:25.417 --> 01:33:28.000
We can dig our way
out of this mess together.

01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:29.167
There is no together!

01:33:29.167 --> 01:33:31.542
I can push this whole thing
off on someone else,

01:33:31.542 --> 01:33:33.667
but before I do that,
you have to tell me the truth

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:35.792
- so I can get this right.
- You know what? I'm done.

01:33:35.792 --> 01:33:38.583
I'm done answering questions
from a fucking hitman.

01:33:38.583 --> 01:33:41.417
You're not a cop!
Let them find out who really did it.

01:33:41.417 --> 01:33:43.333
I've already told you
everything that I know!

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:45.292
I had nothing to do with this!

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:48.167
Ray was a druggie loser asshole.

01:33:48.167 --> 01:33:50.333
Now get the fuck out of my house!

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:52.708
Hey! Last time.

01:33:52.708 --> 01:33:55.000
I am offering you a way out.

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.292
After I walk out of this door,
you're on your own. I could've helped.

01:33:58.292 --> 01:33:59.792
Good. I don't need it.

01:34:01.292 --> 01:34:03.833
And as far as we know,
they could be watching us right now,

01:34:03.833 --> 01:34:05.875
so we should probably
never see each other again.

01:34:05.875 --> 01:34:06.875
Great.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.958
You know, if you see me
publicly, don't say, "Hi."

01:34:08.958 --> 01:34:10.500
Nothing personal.

01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:12.083
We just gotta keep this clean.

01:34:12.083 --> 01:34:13.708
Fine by me.

01:34:21.542 --> 01:34:22.542
Fuck.

01:34:28.792 --> 01:34:30.208
What'd you think?

01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:33.125
What did you think?

01:34:35.042 --> 01:34:37.375
You gave her
plenty of rope to hang herself.

01:34:37.375 --> 01:34:42.167
Mm-hm. She's either the best liar that
we've ever encountered, or she's innocent.

01:34:42.167 --> 01:34:43.917
Yeah.

01:34:43.917 --> 01:34:46.958
- Damn it! I thought it was her.
Yeah, me, too.

01:34:47.792 --> 01:34:49.583
Yeah, she seemed pretty honest in there.

01:34:53.792 --> 01:34:55.292
What about you, Jasper?

01:34:58.250 --> 01:35:01.333
Yeah. I tend to agree.
I don't think she did it.

01:35:03.292 --> 01:35:05.500
Great work in there, Gary. Really.

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.792
So this mystery guy,
the one who pulled the gun,

01:35:12.792 --> 01:35:15.292
- should we try to hunt that guy down?
No.

01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:19.083
No, he just seems like some guy who
pulled a gun on an asshole in an alleyway.

01:35:19.083 --> 01:35:20.458
Nothing much happened.

01:35:21.542 --> 01:35:23.125
Yeah, we're done here.

01:35:50.500 --> 01:35:52.958
Oh, my God!

01:35:53.542 --> 01:35:55.125
Yeah! There he is.

01:35:55.917 --> 01:35:58.208
The man himself.

01:36:05.125 --> 01:36:08.375
I figured you'd be coming by here, man.

01:36:09.042 --> 01:36:11.792
Come on, celebration beer?
I'm gonna get you a beer.

01:36:11.792 --> 01:36:14.375
- You got it the first time. I got it.
- I'll get it.

01:36:15.458 --> 01:36:16.750
She's awesome.

01:36:17.625 --> 01:36:19.167
What's going on, Jasper?

01:36:19.167 --> 01:36:24.208
I was literally just telling Madison here
what phenomenal actors you guys are.

01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:27.125
So, I had to get backstage,

01:36:27.125 --> 01:36:29.833
poke my head inside the green room.

01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:33.625
I mean, your performance was flawless,

01:36:33.625 --> 01:36:35.042
but you...

01:36:35.958 --> 01:36:37.375
you, my friend,

01:36:37.375 --> 01:36:39.583
knocked my fucking socks off.

01:36:40.917 --> 01:36:43.125
Maybe I never gave you
enough credit, Gary.

01:36:43.125 --> 01:36:45.750
Or... Ron. Sorry.

01:36:45.750 --> 01:36:47.417
Gary... Ron...

01:36:49.542 --> 01:36:51.833
I get them mixed up sometimes. Do you?

01:36:51.833 --> 01:36:53.083
Sometimes.

01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:57.167
- Yeah.
- What the fuck is going on?

01:36:58.250 --> 01:37:03.625
Well, I was literally just
telling the lovely Madison

01:37:03.625 --> 01:37:07.167
that I was gonna be fine
with whatever way it went this afternoon.

01:37:07.167 --> 01:37:11.000
That if it just blew up in your face,

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.375
well, at least I'd get my job back.

01:37:13.375 --> 01:37:16.000
But, if you got away with it,

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:20.333
which, hey, congratulations,
it seems like you did,

01:37:21.333 --> 01:37:25.292
I would just have to settle
for a fuck-ton of money.

01:37:26.958 --> 01:37:30.833
Oh, this is where you would go,
"What money, Jasper?"

01:37:30.833 --> 01:37:32.583
Or, "Money from where?"

01:37:32.583 --> 01:37:34.125
And then I would say,

01:37:36.458 --> 01:37:38.750
"the dead husband's insurance policy."

01:37:40.417 --> 01:37:42.875
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:37:42.875 --> 01:37:45.667
This will be our little
understanding, okay?

01:37:45.667 --> 01:37:47.542
The one that keeps me silent

01:37:48.458 --> 01:37:51.250
and you guys out of prison.

01:37:51.958 --> 01:37:54.208
- You got nothing, Jasper.
- Well, I...

01:37:54.208 --> 01:37:56.333
Nah. It's 'cause there isn't
anything. That we're dating?

01:37:56.333 --> 01:37:58.333
- You think anybody gives a shit?
- Oh, shit! I didn't know that.

01:37:58.333 --> 01:37:59.708
Hey! You've already
played your hand here.

01:37:59.708 --> 01:38:01.542
- Congratulations.
- Fuck you! Get lost!

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:02.792
Hey! Stop.

01:38:04.458 --> 01:38:06.083
Stay.

01:38:06.083 --> 01:38:08.542
Babe, sit down.
We're gonna hear him out.

01:38:08.542 --> 01:38:10.958
Yeah, babe, you're being a dick.

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:19.417
I'm just trying to help you guys out.

01:38:19.417 --> 01:38:22.708
- Help us out?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, Gary!

01:38:22.708 --> 01:38:25.875
Enough. Okay? Enough!

01:38:27.042 --> 01:38:29.125
Okay. Cut the bullshit.

01:38:29.125 --> 01:38:32.000
Here, I'll go first, all right?

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.917
I've been following both of you.

01:38:34.917 --> 01:38:37.083
And here, I'll be even more honest.

01:38:37.083 --> 01:38:38.917
I wanted my job back.

01:38:38.917 --> 01:38:44.500
Nothing against you personally,
okay, but holy shit!

01:38:46.583 --> 01:38:51.625
I have enough evidence
to put you away for life.

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:52.875
And you...

01:38:53.583 --> 01:38:55.833
an accomplice to murder?

01:38:56.417 --> 01:38:59.833
Whoa, doggy.

01:39:01.167 --> 01:39:03.542
You're gonna be there for a while.

01:39:03.542 --> 01:39:08.250
And the only reason
that I'm 100 percent sure

01:39:08.250 --> 01:39:13.625
that you did it, is because
I am 100 percent sure

01:39:13.625 --> 01:39:16.625
that your Mr. Tough Guy here...

01:39:18.208 --> 01:39:20.417
couldn't fucking kill a thing.

01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:32.875
The house is hot.

01:39:37.875 --> 01:39:39.417
And ironically,

01:39:41.167 --> 01:39:44.375
life insurance might have
actually saved you guys here.

01:39:44.375 --> 01:39:51.042
I mean, that money
got me thinking, that this...

01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:56.292
...dark...

01:39:58.167 --> 01:40:02.042
fucking adventure, okay,
that we've all been on,

01:40:02.042 --> 01:40:05.667
can actually have a happy ending.

01:40:06.708 --> 01:40:09.958
Okay. So, the day
that you hand over the cash...

01:40:11.708 --> 01:40:14.417
is the...

01:40:15.958 --> 01:40:16.917
Fuck!

01:40:20.667 --> 01:40:21.917
Fuck!

01:40:43.125 --> 01:40:45.500
I'm fucked.

01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:47.208
What just happened?

01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:52.625
I put drugs in his beer.
I hope I didn't overdo it.

01:40:55.625 --> 01:40:58.917
But if he wakes up, I'm going to jail...

01:41:02.875 --> 01:41:04.500
I drugged a cop.

01:41:06.667 --> 01:41:08.375
I am so fucked.

01:41:24.250 --> 01:41:25.458
What are you doing?

01:41:48.292 --> 01:41:49.667
What's that for?

01:41:51.333 --> 01:41:52.542
Commitment.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:01.458
Can't get away with killing a cop.

01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:09.708
Not usually, but for Jasper these days,

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:12.833
I'm thinking we can.

01:42:14.958 --> 01:42:17.917
I mean, the police
are probably thinking about him

01:42:17.917 --> 01:42:19.875
the way we are right now,

01:42:19.875 --> 01:42:24.375
they'd just be better off
if he wasn't around anymore.

01:42:32.042 --> 01:42:33.250
Oh, God.

01:42:38.250 --> 01:42:40.208
So, what's our story?

01:42:42.042 --> 01:42:45.167
He gets found in his car
in a remote area.

01:42:45.167 --> 01:42:47.875
Drugs in his system, bag over his head,

01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:50.333
no contusions or sign of struggle,

01:42:50.333 --> 01:42:51.833
clearly a suicide.

01:42:54.125 --> 01:42:57.042
I mean, his wife left him years ago, so...

01:42:58.542 --> 01:43:00.583
no one to question the story.

01:43:01.667 --> 01:43:07.417
He's racist, misogynistic, abusive.

01:43:08.667 --> 01:43:11.292
A dirty, dirty cop.

01:43:14.833 --> 01:43:16.167
Fuck him.

01:43:22.167 --> 01:43:23.875
Are we really doing this?

01:43:23.875 --> 01:43:25.458
We don't have a choice.

01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:31.167
Look, I know you're taking
a big leap with me,

01:43:31.167 --> 01:43:35.708
and there are some factual loose threads
we'll be dealing with, but...

01:43:37.625 --> 01:43:39.000
I think I'm in love with you.

01:43:43.667 --> 01:43:45.208
Well, it's always a leap.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:51.042
And for the record,
I think I'm in love with you, too.

01:43:55.375 --> 01:43:56.708
For better or worse?

01:43:59.125 --> 01:44:03.208
We can agree
this is kind of the worst, right?

01:44:07.958 --> 01:44:09.083
Right.

01:44:11.875 --> 01:44:14.333
So, we're in this 'til the end?

01:44:14.333 --> 01:44:16.167
'Til death do us part?

01:44:17.042 --> 01:44:20.083
Yes, because I don't believe in divorce.

01:44:21.125 --> 01:44:23.708
I'm kidding.

01:44:23.708 --> 01:44:26.833
So, do we agree on the terms?

01:44:26.833 --> 01:44:29.458
I do.

01:44:29.458 --> 01:44:31.083
Where do I sign?

01:44:33.792 --> 01:44:36.500
- Anywhere else I need to sign?
- Initial here.

01:44:37.875 --> 01:44:42.042
We gotta make sure
this document is airtight.

01:44:42.042 --> 01:44:44.875
I think there's a little place
down here I need to initial.

01:45:02.125 --> 01:45:05.000
I know I've thrown
a lot at you this semester,

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.583
but that's the point, isn't it?

01:45:08.583 --> 01:45:13.250
To be inundated, overwhelmed
by perspectives and possibilities,

01:45:13.250 --> 01:45:17.458
because that is what life is offering you
if you choose to look at it that way.

01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:20.125
And I didn't always.

01:45:20.125 --> 01:45:25.875
I used to believe that reality
was objective, immutable.

01:45:25.875 --> 01:45:31.417
And we're all just sort of stuck
in a Plato-Descartes-Kant sort of way.

01:45:32.583 --> 01:45:34.500
But over the years, I've come to believe

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:37.000
that the truth is created
through the integration

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:40.542
of different points of view,
and there are no absolutes,

01:45:40.542 --> 01:45:43.042
whether moral or epistemological.

01:45:43.042 --> 01:45:46.333
Now, I find this to be a much more
empowering way to go through life,

01:45:46.333 --> 01:45:50.167
this notion that
if the universe is not fixed,

01:45:51.083 --> 01:45:52.708
then neither are you,

01:45:52.708 --> 01:45:56.542
and you really can become a different
and hopefully, better person.

01:45:57.458 --> 01:46:02.083
Now, the one thing I know for certain,
is your reality will change over time

01:46:02.083 --> 01:46:04.542
in ways you cannot even imagine,

01:46:04.542 --> 01:46:09.167
and I urge you to be open
for this transformation.

01:46:09.167 --> 01:46:11.208
So, as we close out this semester,

01:46:11.208 --> 01:46:14.417
if I have one piece of advice
for you moving forward

01:46:14.417 --> 01:46:18.958
in this complicated world, it is this:

01:46:20.417 --> 01:46:25.333
seize the identity you want for yourself.

01:46:27.417 --> 01:46:30.083
And whoever you wanna be after this class,

01:46:30.083 --> 01:46:33.375
be them with passion and abandon.

01:46:33.375 --> 01:46:35.750
Whoo!

01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:38.333
Best of luck to you all
on your final exam.

01:46:39.375 --> 01:46:41.000
You may begin.

01:46:43.667 --> 01:46:46.375
All right. You see all those
white birds out there?

01:46:46.375 --> 01:46:50.833
Notice the long orange bill, right?
That's the white ibis.

01:46:51.833 --> 01:46:55.125
Look at those eyes. They're crazy.

01:46:55.125 --> 01:46:57.167
All right, so,
I know we have the croissants,

01:46:57.167 --> 01:47:00.208
and I know we have the cupcakes.
Are you bringing the apple pie?

01:47:00.208 --> 01:47:02.333
Yeah, I'm bringing
Gary's famous apple pie.

01:47:02.333 --> 01:47:04.875
That's wonderful. Okay. I have that.

01:47:04.875 --> 01:47:08.333
Oh. And don't worry
about the costumes, I got it.

01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:11.917
Thank God. You're the best,
Madison. Thank you.

01:47:11.917 --> 01:47:14.125
We were hoping someone
would step in and help.

01:47:14.125 --> 01:47:16.125
You know, Gabby just bailed for Aspen.

01:47:16.125 --> 01:47:18.250
I could've literally
strangled her to death.

01:47:21.583 --> 01:47:22.542
Yeah. I know.

01:47:22.542 --> 01:47:24.167
Anyway, I'll see you next meeting.

01:47:25.625 --> 01:47:28.917
<i>As love can do, somewhere
along the way, it changed me.</i>

01:47:29.625 --> 01:47:32.875
<i>I eventually found the proper
cocktail of Gary and Ron.</i>

01:47:32.875 --> 01:47:35.458
<i>After all, life is short.</i>

01:47:35.458 --> 01:47:37.500
<i>You gotta live on your own terms.</i>

01:47:39.708 --> 01:47:42.375
Mommy, where did you meet Daddy?

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:59.667
Well, Daddy was
the nicest guy I'd ever met.

01:47:59.667 --> 01:48:02.500
Even though he was being all tough,

01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:04.625
I could tell it was an act.

01:48:04.625 --> 01:48:08.583
And your mother, well, what can I say?

01:48:08.583 --> 01:48:11.083
- It was love at first sight.

01:48:11.083 --> 01:48:13.417
She ended up making a new man out of me.

01:48:16.833 --> 01:48:20.500
But to answer your question,
we met at a magical little place

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:22.458
called the Please U Cafe.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.833
You enjoying your pie?

01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:29.917
All pie is good pie.

01:48:30.667 --> 01:48:32.375
It sure is.
