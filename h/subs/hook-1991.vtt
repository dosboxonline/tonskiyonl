00:51.500 --> 00:53.706
Boy, why are you crying?

00:53.919 --> 00:56.457
Because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.

00:56.671 --> 00:58.960
Besides, I wasn't crying.

00:59.215 --> 01:01.967
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.

01:02.176 --> 01:04.724
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.

01:04.751 --> 01:06.117
It may hurt a little.

01:06.348 --> 01:07.759
What's your name?

01:07.974 --> 01:09.932
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

01:10.185 --> 01:12.094
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.

01:12.687 --> 01:14.596
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.

01:14.814 --> 01:16.688
She's stealing the show.

01:17.525 --> 01:19.980
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

01:20.194 --> 01:21.024
Louder!

01:21.237 --> 01:24.652
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

01:24.907 --> 01:28.573
I shall give you a kiss if you like.

01:29.704 --> 01:31.696
Don't you know what a kiss is?

01:31.914 --> 01:34.405
I shall, once you give one to me.

01:40.631 --> 01:42.338
Now I shall give you a kiss.

01:50.849 --> 01:53.969
I don't ever wanna become a man.

01:55.687 --> 01:58.392
I always wanna be a little boy and have fun.

02:01.192 --> 02:03.905
<i>We wanna be like Peter Pan.</i>

02:03.931 --> 02:06.342
<i>We don't wanna grow up</i>

02:09.658 --> 02:10.904
Brad.

02:12.787 --> 02:14.661
Yeah, I'm at my daughter's play.

02:19.752 --> 02:20.725
It's impossible.

02:20.751 --> 02:24.154
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.

02:24.339 --> 02:28.040
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.

02:28.428 --> 02:29.257
Brad...

02:29.470 --> 02:31.379
Peter, you're missing it.

02:31.597 --> 02:34.882
All right. I want a meeting, tomorrow a.m.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.505
Dad, my game!

02:36.531 --> 02:38.043
You promised.

02:38.270 --> 02:40.144
Listen, it's my son's big game.

02:40.397 --> 02:42.527
Last game of the season. Santa Series.

02:42.553 --> 02:44.289
I gotta be there.
I promised.

02:45.318 --> 02:46.516
We'll make it short.

02:47.028 --> 02:49.318
I'll be there. My word is my bond.

02:49.573 --> 02:50.784
<i>We never, never, never</i>

02:50.810 --> 02:52.350
<i>Never, never, never, never</i>

02:52.576 --> 02:55.991
<i>Never, never, ever wanna grow up</i>

02:56.871 --> 02:58.663
Strike three! You're out.

03:03.544 --> 03:05.702
Bluejays, come on!

03:05.921 --> 03:09.088
Jack! Come on, Bluejays!

03:09.300 --> 03:10.296
Bluejays!

03:12.387 --> 03:13.667
Fire it up!

03:17.516 --> 03:18.965
Where is your father?

03:18.991 --> 03:20.163
He's missing it.

03:20.394 --> 03:23.679
Daddy'll be here. He promised.

03:24.064 --> 03:25.013
Jerry? Jack?

03:25.232 --> 03:26.228
- Jim.
- I said that.

03:26.483 --> 03:28.217
Go to the game ahead of me.

03:28.243 --> 03:29.462
Film what I miss.

03:29.653 --> 03:32.227
This is the speech for your grandmother's tribute.

03:32.448 --> 03:33.313
- On cards?
- Yes.

03:33.532 --> 03:35.525
- Number those. Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.

03:35.743 --> 03:37.450
I loved his annual report.
Read it.

03:37.661 --> 03:42.323
"For the past 70 years, the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...

03:42.540 --> 03:45.790
...has given hope and care and life to hundreds of orphans."

03:46.002 --> 03:47.033
Great.

03:47.378 --> 03:49.252
Mommy, where's Daddy?

03:51.000 --> 03:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:00.141 --> 04:01.849
My briefcase.

04:14.572 --> 04:15.521
Gotta fly.

04:15.781 --> 04:16.454
Don't worry.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.048
More people crash in cars.

04:18.284 --> 04:21.817
It's a lot safer to fly than crossing the street.

04:22.036 --> 04:24.326
If it's your time to go, it's your time to go.

04:24.748 --> 04:28.282
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!

04:28.793 --> 04:31.035
What if it's the pilot's time to go?

04:32.005 --> 04:33.476
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!

04:33.502 --> 04:34.237
Keep us alive!

04:34.425 --> 04:35.290
Okay, come on!

04:35.509 --> 04:36.600
Hi, Mrs. Banning.

04:36.626 --> 04:37.947
I'm from the office.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.448
Which one's your son?

04:39.679 --> 04:42.087
- He's up to bat!
- Thank you!

04:43.224 --> 04:44.600
Come on, Jack!

04:46.978 --> 04:48.887
Come on, pal!

04:49.105 --> 04:49.935
Come on, Jack!

04:50.523 --> 04:51.981
Don't look at me! Focus!

04:52.566 --> 04:54.227
Stay focused! Come on, Jack.

04:54.253 --> 04:55.261
One time, Jack.

04:56.779 --> 04:59.187
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

05:00.741 --> 05:02.734
Please, not a curve ball.

05:03.119 --> 05:05.381
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.

05:05.407 --> 05:07.011
Drive me home, Jack!

05:12.627 --> 05:13.623
That's the game!

06:03.094 --> 06:04.753
Yeah, Brad, that's real good.

06:12.727 --> 06:15.598
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, your captain again.</i>

06:15.814 --> 06:19.479
<i>Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.</i>

06:29.494 --> 06:31.453
<i>For now, please sit back, relax.</i>

06:31.479 --> 06:33.682
<i>Enjoy the remainder of the flight.</i>

06:33.873 --> 06:35.118
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:36.000 --> 06:37.826
Look what Jack drew!

06:38.043 --> 06:39.621
That's very nice, dear.

06:39.837 --> 06:40.952
What's that?

06:41.506 --> 06:42.336
Fire.

06:42.548 --> 06:44.422
Fire! Really?

06:44.675 --> 06:46.170
Is that our plane?

06:47.720 --> 06:48.834
Who are these people?

06:49.054 --> 06:52.637
That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom...

06:52.891 --> 06:54.516
...and that's you.

06:55.477 --> 06:56.675
Where's my parachute?

06:59.231 --> 07:00.944
I won't make it to my birthday.

07:00.970 --> 07:02.957
You won't die without a phone.

07:03.152 --> 07:04.978
I got the phone in the briefcase.

07:05.237 --> 07:06.517
Talk to him.

07:13.703 --> 07:15.577
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?

07:15.997 --> 07:17.277
Take a wild guess.

07:17.540 --> 07:19.947
- Jackie!
- Jack.

07:20.293 --> 07:22.203
Will you stop?
You can break a window.

07:22.421 --> 07:23.272
They're layered.

07:23.298 --> 07:24.521
You can't break them.

07:24.839 --> 07:26.417
Give me that.

07:29.677 --> 07:31.551
You're afraid you'll get sucked out.

07:31.762 --> 07:33.043
I'm not afraid.

07:33.264 --> 07:33.902
Yes, you are.

07:33.928 --> 07:35.744
You're afraid you'll be sucked out.

07:35.975 --> 07:37.469
Just stop.

07:41.313 --> 07:44.184
Jack, next season, I'm coming to six games. I promise.

07:44.817 --> 07:47.687
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.

07:52.741 --> 07:54.366
My word is my bond.

07:54.743 --> 07:56.403
Yeah, junk bond!

07:59.205 --> 08:02.289
When are you gonna stop acting like a child?

08:03.584 --> 08:04.617
I am a child.

08:04.837 --> 08:06.035
Grow up.

08:08.381 --> 08:09.840
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

08:10.091 --> 08:11.716
<i>Let's have fun, Peter.</i>

08:12.010 --> 08:13.967
London's a magical place for children.

08:14.179 --> 08:15.922
- It was for us.
- And expensive.

08:16.139 --> 08:17.189
Jack, don't do that.

08:17.215 --> 08:18.999
You could put someone's eye out.

08:19.267 --> 08:21.010
Maggie. Maggie.

08:21.227 --> 08:23.100
Peter, it's number 14.

08:23.312 --> 08:24.225
Sorry.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.272
What do you say to Granny Wendy?

08:26.524 --> 08:27.557
- "How do you do?"

08:27.583 --> 08:28.672
- Jack, get down!

08:28.860 --> 08:29.891
Be careful.

08:30.444 --> 08:33.563
Is Granny Wendy the real, real Wendy from my play?

08:33.823 --> 08:34.818
No, not really.

08:35.032 --> 08:36.491
Sort of.

08:36.866 --> 08:38.101
Don't be a sloucher.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.225
Take that gum out of your mouth.

08:40.453 --> 08:41.888
It's time to look our best.

08:41.914 --> 08:44.144
First impressions are the most important.

08:44.374 --> 08:46.284
Shoes tied. Shirt tucked.

08:46.502 --> 08:47.747
You know this.

08:49.254 --> 08:51.710
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.795
Uncle Tootles.

08:53.008 --> 08:54.835
It's snowing!

09:05.895 --> 09:08.565
Look at these adorable children!

09:08.773 --> 09:11.145
It's good to see you, Libby... Linda... Lisa...

09:11.401 --> 09:13.393
- Liza.
- I said that.

09:14.195 --> 09:15.739
Oh, Moira, how are you?

09:15.765 --> 09:17.174
You look wonderful!

09:17.406 --> 09:18.865
Oh, my God!

09:19.075 --> 09:19.940
Look at the size...

09:20.159 --> 09:22.317
Look at you! Such a sweet thing!

09:22.536 --> 09:24.229
Granny Wendy will be right down.

09:24.255 --> 09:25.894
She's upstairs? Oh, good.

09:26.748 --> 09:30.200
- Big boy! You could play rugby.
- No, baseball.

09:30.544 --> 09:31.374
Oh, look.

09:31.587 --> 09:32.697
Did you do this for us?

09:32.723 --> 09:34.364
We've been cooking all week.

09:34.548 --> 09:35.718
You've been cooking?

09:35.744 --> 09:38.024
What've you been cooking?
Mince pies?

09:38.302 --> 09:40.377
Peter, look at this.
Look at this.

09:40.595 --> 09:42.422
- Who's that?
- It's you.

09:42.639 --> 09:44.631
Was I ever that young?

09:44.849 --> 09:46.295
What's gotten into you?

09:46.321 --> 09:48.457
This house has gotten to me.

09:48.686 --> 09:52.020
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.

09:52.274 --> 09:53.052
Oh, thank God!

09:53.078 --> 09:54.968
We were children in these rooms.

09:55.193 --> 09:57.980
Lost, lost, lost.

09:58.196 --> 09:59.476
Lost what?

10:00.323 --> 10:02.399
I've lost my marbles.

10:04.577 --> 10:05.822
Lisa?

10:06.662 --> 10:07.611
Liza.

10:07.830 --> 10:09.360
He was supposed to be in a home.

10:09.386 --> 10:10.773
It broke Wendy's heart.

10:10.959 --> 10:12.400
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.

10:12.426 --> 10:13.190
Which is which?

10:13.378 --> 10:16.414
Large bag's mine, and the smaller ones are the children's.

10:16.672 --> 10:18.332
Hello, boy.

10:27.516 --> 10:29.259
Hello, Wendy.

10:38.151 --> 10:41.602
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.

10:46.617 --> 10:48.693
I'm sorry it's been so long between visits.

10:48.953 --> 10:51.365
It's been 10 years between visits.

10:51.391 --> 10:52.597
But never mind.

10:52.833 --> 10:55.205
Come and give me a skwoodge.

11:02.550 --> 11:04.957
Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!

11:07.137 --> 11:08.631
Who is this lovely lady?

11:08.889 --> 11:10.217
It can't be Maggie.

11:10.474 --> 11:12.306
Yes, it can.
And know what?

11:12.332 --> 11:14.367
I just played you at school.

11:14.562 --> 11:16.471
And don't you just look the part.

11:16.731 --> 11:18.324
Can this giant be Jack?

11:18.350 --> 11:20.705
How much you've grown in a year!

11:20.901 --> 11:22.728
I'm supposed to tell you about...

11:22.945 --> 11:27.072
...congratulations for opening the orphan hospital...

11:27.282 --> 11:30.615
...and how great the dedication is.

11:31.661 --> 11:34.497
- Thank you so very much.
- Welcome.

11:34.748 --> 11:39.374
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house:

11:40.045 --> 11:42.500
No growing up.

11:43.339 --> 11:46.091
Stop this very instant.

11:46.342 --> 11:49.426
And that includes you, Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board Banning.

11:49.679 --> 11:50.841
Sorry, too late, Gran.

11:51.055 --> 11:55.349
And what's so terribly important about your terribly important business?

11:55.602 --> 11:58.175
You see, when a big company's in trouble...

11:58.438 --> 12:01.273
...Dad sails in, and if there's any resistance...

12:01.524 --> 12:02.414
He's exaggerating.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.466
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions.

12:04.693 --> 12:07.184
And I'm dabbling in some land development.

12:07.404 --> 12:10.488
Any resistance and he blows them out of the water.

12:14.035 --> 12:15.578
So!

12:16.330 --> 12:19.414
Peter, you've become a pirate!

13:25.146 --> 13:26.476
Brad's on the line.

13:26.502 --> 13:28.042
He says it's urgent!

13:34.613 --> 13:35.811
Do you like my dress?

13:36.031 --> 13:37.656
Great, Gran.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.364
Thanks.

13:41.746 --> 13:44.284
Hey, Brad. Good news?

13:45.291 --> 13:46.536
What?

13:47.335 --> 13:48.668
What Sierra Club report?

13:48.694 --> 13:50.360
I thought we had these guys.

13:51.880 --> 13:53.713
He's trying to suck my blood!

13:53.739 --> 13:55.570
He drools all over my neck.

13:55.759 --> 13:56.790
What did they find?

13:57.010 --> 13:58.700
That's a portable phone...

13:58.726 --> 14:00.155
A Cozy Blue Owl?

14:01.640 --> 14:04.807
Well, listen.

14:05.018 --> 14:08.601
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

14:08.855 --> 14:11.466
Oh, well, I do! Boy, do I ever!

14:11.492 --> 14:13.091
Wow, you kidding?

14:13.359 --> 14:14.273
Wait a minute.

14:14.486 --> 14:18.483
You telling me a 10-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?

14:18.698 --> 14:21.569
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?

14:21.785 --> 14:26.612
You're telling me a 5-billion-dollar deal is falling apart because of this?

14:27.498 --> 14:29.206
Somebody shoot me in the head!

14:30.042 --> 14:31.240
Bang! Bang!

14:31.502 --> 14:32.913
Will everybody just shut up!

14:33.379 --> 14:34.209
I'm sorry.

14:34.630 --> 14:36.208
Leave me alone for one moment!

14:36.423 --> 14:37.517
Get them out of here!

14:37.543 --> 14:39.366
I'm on the phone call of my life!

14:40.719 --> 14:41.664
Come on, Jack.

14:41.690 --> 14:42.702
Out, out, out.

14:44.098 --> 14:45.592
Come with me.

14:45.891 --> 14:50.802
I'll show you the window where your dad and I used to blow out the stars.

14:53.357 --> 14:55.645
I should've stayed till the deal was done.

14:55.901 --> 14:58.356
Granny asked you to visit every year.

14:58.611 --> 14:59.560
I've been busy.

14:59.821 --> 15:02.539
You promised the children some real time here.

15:02.565 --> 15:04.473
You haven't looked at them once.

15:04.660 --> 15:05.594
That's not true.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.721
How many more broken promises?

15:13.918 --> 15:14.945
It's Brad, Moira.

15:14.971 --> 15:16.481
I gotta take this call.

15:17.380 --> 15:18.660
I gotta fix this.

15:19.215 --> 15:21.753
No, you gotta fix your family first.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.637
<i>Peter, hello?
Are you there?</i>

15:37.357 --> 15:38.602
What?

15:40.610 --> 15:42.013
I'm sorry about your deal.

15:42.039 --> 15:43.387
You hated the deal.

15:43.572 --> 15:44.710
I hated the deal.

15:44.736 --> 15:47.547
But I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.

15:48.452 --> 15:50.444
Your children love you.

15:50.913 --> 15:52.739
They want to play with you.

15:53.415 --> 15:55.657
How long do you think that lasts?

15:56.543 --> 15:59.828
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.

16:01.172 --> 16:04.422
We have a few special years with our children...

16:04.634 --> 16:07.339
...when they're the ones that want us around.

16:07.846 --> 16:11.096
Then you'll be running after them for a bit of attention.

16:12.225 --> 16:14.217
It's so fast, Peter.

16:15.103 --> 16:18.388
It's a few years, then it's over.

16:21.609 --> 16:24.230
And you are not being careful.

16:26.196 --> 16:28.605
And you are missing it.

16:35.539 --> 16:37.163
<i>Peter, where are you?</i>

16:41.545 --> 16:44.462
<i>Peter! Peter! Peter!</i>

16:45.173 --> 16:49.670
"All children, except one, grow up."

16:50.470 --> 16:53.839
Now, you know where faeries come from, don't you, Maggie?

16:54.558 --> 16:58.472
"When the first baby laughed for the first time...

16:58.728 --> 17:01.598
...the laugh broke into a thousand pieces...

17:01.856 --> 17:03.979
...and they all went skipping about.

17:04.233 --> 17:06.605
That was the beginning of faeries."

17:06.861 --> 17:07.809
And look.

17:10.406 --> 17:12.198
I'm Wendy.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.942
Or was, a long time ago.

17:16.871 --> 17:20.570
But Jack says you're not the really "real" Wendy.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.829
Do you see where Jack is?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.037
Well, that's the same window.

17:26.063 --> 17:27.606
And this is the same room...

17:27.797 --> 17:32.460
...where we made up stories about Peter, Never Land and scary old Captain Hook.

17:32.720 --> 17:36.634
And do you know, Mr. Barrie, well, Sir James, our neighbor...

17:36.890 --> 17:40.970
...loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.181
Oh, dear me, 80 years ago.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.729
You're really old!

17:46.983 --> 17:48.892
That's very true.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.338
I'm sorry to break this up.

17:51.364 --> 17:52.840
I have to steal Granny...

17:53.031 --> 17:56.400
...or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.574
Oh, dear.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.707
Daddy, I made something for you.

18:03.733 --> 18:05.230
You're gonna love this.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.159
It's a hug.

18:06.185 --> 18:08.983
Next time you fly, you won't have to be scared.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.419
She's made you a parachute.

18:11.798 --> 18:13.922
That's very clever, dear.

18:15.386 --> 18:16.382
Get away from there!

18:16.595 --> 18:20.098
What have I told you about playing near open windows?

18:20.124 --> 18:21.745
Keep this window closed.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.517
Do we have open windows at home?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.010
No. They've all got bars on them.

18:26.479 --> 18:27.890
Come on. Into bed.

18:31.859 --> 18:33.189
Who took my baseball?

18:33.570 --> 18:36.904
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.320
There's no scary man.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.576
But he says he's a window washer.

18:43.371 --> 18:44.201
What's this?

18:44.455 --> 18:45.403
A baseball glove.

18:45.429 --> 18:47.267
You can catch things with it...

18:47.458 --> 18:50.791
...take hot things out of the oven, hit your sister with it.

18:52.463 --> 18:54.524
Tootles made it for me.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.071
It smells nice.

18:56.259 --> 18:57.718
It's paper, honey.

19:03.849 --> 19:05.427
Hey, Jack.

19:06.352 --> 19:07.727
Faker.

19:09.354 --> 19:11.394
You're in charge now.

19:11.606 --> 19:15.439
This is my very special watch, so you can keep track of the time.

19:15.736 --> 19:18.571
Don't go out, Mom. Please.

19:23.243 --> 19:24.618
Good night.

19:32.794 --> 19:36.662
Dear night-lights, protect my sleeping babes.

19:36.882 --> 19:40.665
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.

19:44.097 --> 19:49.221
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats for experiments.

19:50.144 --> 19:51.555
They do this for two reasons:

19:51.812 --> 19:56.106
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.

19:57.026 --> 20:00.893
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.

20:06.743 --> 20:10.278
I thank the Board of Trustees of the Ormond Street Hospital...

20:10.539 --> 20:12.578
...for having me here this evening...

20:13.166 --> 20:17.578
...and beg your forgiveness because normally I address shareholders.

20:19.506 --> 20:24.251
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common...

20:24.719 --> 20:28.633
...except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.

20:31.434 --> 20:33.510
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.

20:33.728 --> 20:35.934
She taught me to read and write.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.232
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.

20:41.152 --> 20:43.026
She's loved so many children...

20:43.237 --> 20:47.698
...just so efforlete...
efforse... effortlessly.

20:48.284 --> 20:49.908
That's her achievement.

20:50.411 --> 20:53.198
Many of you here tonight were once lost children...

20:53.413 --> 20:57.031
...but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you...

20:57.292 --> 20:58.572
...and saved you.

20:58.835 --> 20:59.832
That's her miracle.

21:01.046 --> 21:05.589
I know that if you could stand now, you would express much better than I have...

21:05.843 --> 21:09.710
...your feelings of gratitude...

21:12.515 --> 21:14.093
...appreciation...

21:16.185 --> 21:18.059
...and warm feelings...

21:18.896 --> 21:20.771
...for this wonderful woman.

21:36.497 --> 21:39.118
I guess we do have something in common.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.085
We're orphans.

22:02.773 --> 22:04.765
Hook!

22:06.651 --> 22:08.110
Hook.

22:43.103 --> 22:44.383
Jack...

23:25.352 --> 23:26.728
You all right?

23:27.021 --> 23:28.266
Wendy?

23:45.079 --> 23:46.538
Thank you, Nigel. Norman?

23:46.789 --> 23:47.905
Neville, sir.

23:48.167 --> 23:49.661
Is that English?

23:49.960 --> 23:51.751
Merry Christmas.

23:54.047 --> 23:55.506
I was proud of you.

23:55.715 --> 23:57.921
It was a beautiful speech.

23:58.176 --> 23:59.884
Yes, it was.

24:19.572 --> 24:20.947
Liza?

24:21.323 --> 24:22.817
Tootles?

24:27.495 --> 24:30.118
My God!
The children!

24:37.047 --> 24:38.874
Jack! Answer me!

24:39.132 --> 24:40.377
Maggie!

24:41.801 --> 24:43.218
The wind came up.

24:43.244 --> 24:45.409
The door closed on me...

24:45.638 --> 24:47.880
...and the children were screaming!

24:48.140 --> 24:51.427
The children were screaming!

25:01.696 --> 25:02.941
The window.

25:16.293 --> 25:17.242
"Dear Peter:

25:17.461 --> 25:20.794
Your presence is required at the request of your children.

25:23.050 --> 25:25.375
Kindest personal regards...

25:25.594 --> 25:27.253
...J.A.S. Hook...

25:27.846 --> 25:29.126
...Captain."

25:34.228 --> 25:37.477
Have to fly. Have to fight.

25:37.856 --> 25:40.373
Have to crow. Have to save Maggie.

25:40.399 --> 25:41.878
Have to save Jack.

25:43.194 --> 25:45.068
Hook is back.

25:46.322 --> 25:47.353
Who?

25:48.741 --> 25:49.986
Gran!

25:55.623 --> 25:58.328
Well, the lab boys can analyze this little lot.

25:59.001 --> 26:03.959
We've wired the phones, and two of my lads will be outside at all times.

26:04.423 --> 26:08.123
It's possible that this is some kind of ridiculous prank.

26:08.385 --> 26:10.212
My children are missing.

26:10.721 --> 26:14.589
Yes, but the literary history of the family suggests...

26:14.892 --> 26:15.841
Let's hope...

26:16.060 --> 26:18.136
I've forgotten how to fly.

26:18.979 --> 26:21.268
Yeah, well, one does.

26:21.857 --> 26:22.812
Good night, ma'am.

26:22.838 --> 26:23.791
Good night, sir.

26:26.778 --> 26:29.613
No more happy thoughts.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.068
Lost!

26:33.367 --> 26:34.696
Lost!

26:46.881 --> 26:49.304
The police will do everything they can.

26:49.330 --> 26:51.318
The police can do nothing.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.880
Really? Maybe we should call the American police.

26:55.097 --> 26:57.719
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.

26:57.934 --> 26:59.048
Moira, would you?

26:59.310 --> 27:00.259
Yes, of course.

27:00.478 --> 27:02.766
Don't forget to warm the pot.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.481
I'll go.

27:06.525 --> 27:07.984
You stay.

27:08.694 --> 27:11.694
Don't worry, Gran Wendy, I wasn't gonna leave.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.485
Hand me my book, please.

27:21.415 --> 27:23.621
It's time to tell you, at last.

27:25.335 --> 27:26.746
Tell me what?

27:27.879 --> 27:31.746
How far back can you remember, Peter?

27:32.967 --> 27:35.921
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.

27:36.637 --> 27:38.262
You worked with orphans.

27:38.515 --> 27:41.966
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.802
You were 12, nearly 13.

27:45.062 --> 27:46.971
I mean, before that.

27:47.440 --> 27:49.099
There's nothing before that.

27:50.734 --> 27:53.023
Try, Peter. Do try.

27:54.988 --> 27:56.363
Nothing.

28:00.619 --> 28:03.655
You know, when I was young...

28:05.999 --> 28:09.285
...no other girl held your favor the way I did.

28:11.546 --> 28:16.671
I expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows on my wedding day.

28:17.844 --> 28:20.762
I wore a pink satin sash.

28:23.516 --> 28:25.343
But you didn't come.

28:26.895 --> 28:28.270
Grandma?

28:29.355 --> 28:33.399
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets.

28:33.651 --> 28:35.394
A grandmother.

28:35.653 --> 28:38.404
With my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed.

28:38.655 --> 28:39.900
Moira.

28:40.741 --> 28:42.651
And when you saw her...

28:43.744 --> 28:47.327
...that was when you decided not to go back to Never Land.

28:49.833 --> 28:50.996
Where?

28:51.585 --> 28:53.708
To Never Never Land.

28:56.089 --> 28:56.820
I'll get Moira.

28:56.846 --> 28:58.356
I've tried to tell you...

28:58.550 --> 28:59.716
Maybe the tea's ready.

28:59.742 --> 29:01.279
I knew you'd forgotten!

29:01.469 --> 29:03.427
I'm not ready to deal with this now.

29:03.639 --> 29:05.880
The stories are true.

29:05.906 --> 29:07.613
I swear to you.

29:08.351 --> 29:10.558
I swear on everything I adore.

29:10.770 --> 29:13.771
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.

29:14.023 --> 29:16.561
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.

29:16.776 --> 29:17.725
He wants you back.

29:17.944 --> 29:21.526
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack to the ends of the earth.

29:21.739 --> 29:24.990
And, by heaven, you must find a way.

29:26.119 --> 29:29.570
Only you can save your children.

29:30.915 --> 29:33.750
Somehow, you must go back.

29:34.877 --> 29:38.127
You must make yourself remember.

29:39.881 --> 29:41.673
Remember what?

29:43.968 --> 29:47.504
Peter, don't you know who you are?

30:08.827 --> 30:10.237

30:28.179 --> 30:29.424
Sorry.

30:38.855 --> 30:40.100
Parachute...

31:27.611 --> 31:30.019
Firefly from hell!

31:32.199 --> 31:33.741
Big damn bug!

31:46.712 --> 31:48.253
It is you! It is!

31:48.279 --> 31:49.275
A big you!

31:49.465 --> 31:50.766
It's not bad you're big.

31:50.792 --> 31:51.982
You were always big.

31:52.177 --> 31:55.261
Maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.

31:56.556 --> 31:58.152
What fun we'll have again!

31:58.178 --> 32:00.080
What times!
What great games!

32:03.687 --> 32:05.265
You're a little...

32:07.232 --> 32:08.608
Faerie.

32:13.030 --> 32:13.860
Pixie.

32:14.073 --> 32:16.742
If less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.

32:16.992 --> 32:17.822
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.

32:18.035 --> 32:19.066
- Banning.
- Pan.

32:19.286 --> 32:21.325
Whoever you are, it's still you.

32:21.580 --> 32:24.118
Because only one person has that smell.

32:24.458 --> 32:25.620
Smell?

32:25.834 --> 32:28.241
The smell of someone who's ridden the wind.

32:28.461 --> 32:30.518
The smell of sleeping in trees.

32:30.544 --> 32:33.065
Adventures with Indians and pirates.

32:33.258 --> 32:34.835
Remember?
 The world was ours!

32:34.861 --> 32:36.818
We could do everything or nothing.

32:37.012 --> 32:39.847
I had to be anything because it was always us.

32:43.101 --> 32:45.971
It's happened.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

32:46.187 --> 32:48.475
Follow me and all will be well.

32:48.689 --> 32:51.082
I'm dying. Heading towards the white light.

32:51.108 --> 32:52.165
I've left my body.

32:52.359 --> 32:53.813
There's my house down there.

32:53.839 --> 32:54.876
There are my feet.

32:55.196 --> 32:56.256
Where are we going?

32:56.282 --> 32:57.842
To save your children!

32:58.116 --> 32:59.409
How do you know about my kids?

32:59.435 --> 33:00.382
Everybody knows!

33:00.576 --> 33:03.861
Hook's got them and you've gotta fight him! Let's fly!

33:10.502 --> 33:11.937
It is true, then.

33:11.963 --> 33:13.481
You did grow up.

33:16.008 --> 33:17.388
I drank poison for you.

33:17.414 --> 33:19.153
You used to call me "Tink."

33:19.344 --> 33:20.896
Have you forgotten everything?

33:20.922 --> 33:22.370
Are you in there, bug?

33:22.639 --> 33:24.928
I'm not a bug. I'm a faerie.

33:29.812 --> 33:31.721
I do not believe in faeries.

33:32.106 --> 33:37.101
Anytime someone says, "I do not believe in faeries," a faerie falls down dead.

33:37.320 --> 33:39.064
I do not believe in faeries!!

33:51.000 --> 33:52.873
My God, I think I killed it.

33:54.294 --> 33:56.964
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!

33:57.548 --> 34:00.335
Clap your hands, Peter.

34:00.551 --> 34:02.045
It's the only way to save me.

34:02.553 --> 34:03.928
Clap...

34:05.347 --> 34:06.627
Louder.

34:07.724 --> 34:09.135
Louder, Peter!

34:12.228 --> 34:13.722
I'm clapping!

34:14.647 --> 34:16.306
Oh, God, you're alive!

34:16.734 --> 34:18.809
All right.
Now, who am I?

34:26.743 --> 34:30.112
You're a Freudian hallucination of my mother.

34:30.329 --> 34:33.579
I don't know why you have wings, but you have lovely legs.

34:33.791 --> 34:35.618
What am I saying?
I'm an orphan.

34:35.876 --> 34:38.344
I've never taken drugs. I missed the '60s.

34:38.370 --> 34:39.601
I was an accountant.

34:40.215 --> 34:41.080
Guess again!

34:43.801 --> 34:45.460
Look, stars!

34:45.678 --> 34:46.958
That's right, Peter.

34:47.179 --> 34:50.215
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.

34:51.350 --> 34:52.927
Never Land!

35:54.411 --> 35:56.534
What a nightmare!

36:13.513 --> 36:16.182
Roll out! Roll out!

36:27.568 --> 36:30.984
Lovely fish! Fresh fish!

36:31.197 --> 36:35.111
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week!

36:39.871 --> 36:42.825
Excuse me.
Is there a pay phone around here?

36:43.416 --> 36:44.331
That is so real.

36:44.543 --> 36:45.622
Peter, get back here!

36:45.836 --> 36:47.295
Get down!
Get low!

36:47.629 --> 36:48.661
Hide!

36:51.883 --> 36:53.792
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.802
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.

36:56.179 --> 36:59.299
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booties.

36:59.515 --> 37:01.591
I think you can get them at Armani.

37:02.727 --> 37:05.349
Tink! Tink! Help!

37:08.358 --> 37:10.066
Don't get no blood on them boots!

37:10.401 --> 37:11.860
They's mine!

37:12.070 --> 37:13.729
Help me! Tinkerbell!

37:15.198 --> 37:16.395
You pixie devil!

37:20.452 --> 37:22.860
Please don't! I have a bad back!

37:24.790 --> 37:26.830
You pixie devil!

37:34.716 --> 37:36.259
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?

37:41.723 --> 37:44.178
If you insist on seeing Hook...

37:44.392 --> 37:45.767
...do exactly what I say.

37:45.977 --> 37:49.228
Your left arm is dead and hangs lifeless at your side.

37:49.815 --> 37:52.899
Lean on the crutch! Left foot turned in.

37:53.151 --> 37:56.021
Tilt your head and glare with your good eye!

37:56.321 --> 37:59.772
Now crack your mouth and drool. Now growl!

38:00.032 --> 38:00.862
Growl!

38:01.075 --> 38:01.701
How are you?

38:01.727 --> 38:02.927
Not bad, and you?

38:03.160 --> 38:04.571
Not bad!

38:25.432 --> 38:27.487
Put your faces on, girls.

38:27.513 --> 38:28.992
Here comes Smee!

38:33.190 --> 38:34.649
Follow that Hook!

38:34.983 --> 38:37.308
Make way for the Hook!

38:39.070 --> 38:41.359
Me mother loves that Hook!

38:49.831 --> 38:51.491
Give us the Hook!

38:53.793 --> 38:55.252
Give us the Hook!

39:24.322 --> 39:27.406
Good morning, Never Land!

39:27.617 --> 39:30.701
Good morning, Mr. Smee!

39:31.204 --> 39:33.826
Tie down the main mast, mateys.

39:34.499 --> 39:36.788
Because here he is! The cunning kingfish!

39:37.460 --> 39:38.705
The brave barracuda!

39:39.921 --> 39:43.621
A man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.

39:45.384 --> 39:50.295
A man so quick, he's even fast asleep!

39:50.764 --> 39:51.796
Thank you!

39:52.016 --> 39:53.890
Let's give him a very big hand...

39:54.102 --> 39:56.343
...because he's only got one.

39:58.064 --> 40:01.598
I give you the steel-handed stingray...

40:01.817 --> 40:04.652
...Captain James Hook!

40:04.903 --> 40:06.777
Hook! Hook! Hook! Hook!

40:15.956 --> 40:17.865
See how greatly the men favor you, sir?

40:18.083 --> 40:19.791
The pealing spawn.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.808
How I despise them!

40:22.003 --> 40:23.877
Go get 'em, captain!

40:27.800 --> 40:29.081
Thank you!

40:31.179 --> 40:36.304
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails...

40:39.062 --> 40:40.889
Revenge is mine.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.017
Long live the Hook!

40:44.233 --> 40:47.269
I baited that Hook and now I'm proud to announce...

40:47.486 --> 40:49.360
...we have his children.

40:49.905 --> 40:53.025
My God! Jack and Maggie.

40:55.118 --> 40:57.491
Finally I'm going to kill Peter Pan...

40:57.705 --> 41:02.248
...that cocky boy who cut off my hand and fed it to the crocodile!

41:02.835 --> 41:06.453
And who killed that cunning crocodile? Who stuffed him?

41:06.672 --> 41:08.331
Who made him into a quiet clock?

41:08.548 --> 41:11.584
Who went to the other world and stole Pan's children?

41:12.260 --> 41:14.549
And who didn't believe I could do it?

41:15.263 --> 41:16.841
Who doubted me?

41:17.933 --> 41:20.175
Who amongst us does not belong?

41:20.894 --> 41:22.721
Someone here does not belong.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.607
Stranger amongst the loyal, I'll weed you out.

41:28.818 --> 41:29.933
You!

41:34.156 --> 41:35.615
You!

41:39.829 --> 41:41.620
Where's the carpet, Smee?

41:41.831 --> 41:43.325
Sorry, sir.

41:46.085 --> 41:47.283
You!

41:47.753 --> 41:49.461
You! That's right, you!

41:49.672 --> 41:51.960
No, not you! Not you.

41:53.091 --> 41:54.372
You.

41:55.260 --> 41:56.256
You!

41:59.181 --> 42:02.716
You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?

42:04.895 --> 42:07.101
Tell your captain the truth.

42:11.151 --> 42:13.108
Say it. Say it.

42:14.070 --> 42:15.232
I did.

42:15.488 --> 42:17.445
- You made a boo-boo.
- I did.

42:18.574 --> 42:19.751
The Boo Box.

42:19.777 --> 42:21.933
Not the Boo Box!

42:39.303 --> 42:40.466
Boo!

42:44.809 --> 42:46.137
Put me down!

42:46.352 --> 42:48.294
I want my mommy!

42:48.320 --> 42:50.504
I want my daddy!

42:50.981 --> 42:52.808
Hello, children.

42:53.024 --> 42:55.432
Comfy? Cozy?

42:55.694 --> 42:58.363
Those are my kids!

42:58.571 --> 43:00.480
Those are my kids!

43:04.369 --> 43:06.942
Everything's gonna be all right.

43:08.540 --> 43:09.338
It's all right.

43:09.364 --> 43:10.107
Daddy's here.

43:10.583 --> 43:14.581
I want those kids out of that net or you better get an attorney.

43:14.796 --> 43:15.875
Who are you?

43:16.088 --> 43:17.183
I'm Peter Banning.

43:17.209 --> 43:18.485
I want my children.

43:18.674 --> 43:19.872
Those are your?

43:20.134 --> 43:21.592
These are your children?

43:21.927 --> 43:22.959
And you're?

43:23.179 --> 43:24.093
You're Peter?

43:24.305 --> 43:26.345
You're Peter?
 No!

43:27.100 --> 43:27.883
You're Peter?

43:27.909 --> 43:30.078
Is there an echo in here?
 Yes!

43:30.269 --> 43:32.807
My great and worthy opponent?

43:34.982 --> 43:36.180
Who is this impostor?

43:36.400 --> 43:39.187
Peter flogging flying Pan!

43:40.570 --> 43:41.832
I'm not Peter Pan.

43:41.858 --> 43:43.680
I am just an ordinary...

43:43.908 --> 43:46.114
I've got a sworn affidavit by a T. Bell.

43:46.410 --> 43:48.073
I've got his medical history.

43:48.099 --> 43:49.934
I even got his dental records.

43:50.831 --> 43:53.286
Are you trying to do me out of my job?

43:53.500 --> 43:54.830
May I show you something?

43:54.856 --> 43:55.813
Will you let go?

43:56.002 --> 43:57.165
Release him.

43:57.378 --> 43:58.458
May I show you this?

43:58.484 --> 43:59.941
Will you shut him up.

44:03.843 --> 44:05.226
Captain, put these on.

44:05.252 --> 44:07.072
I want to see the scar.

44:07.263 --> 44:08.592
The hypertrophy.

44:09.390 --> 44:12.806
Here's where you sliced him during the Tiger Lily incident.

44:13.019 --> 44:14.133
That's my appendix!

44:14.353 --> 44:15.385
What's this?

44:15.605 --> 44:17.002
Faerie footprints.

44:17.028 --> 44:20.754
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.

44:23.946 --> 44:25.773
Is it you?

44:26.365 --> 44:29.532
My great and worthy opponent?

44:30.327 --> 44:32.450
But it can't be.

44:33.330 --> 44:36.035
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated...

44:36.291 --> 44:39.327
...codfish I see before me.

44:39.836 --> 44:42.872
You're not even a shadow of Peter Pan.

44:46.218 --> 44:49.384
You have an obligation to clarify this Pan problem.

44:49.596 --> 44:50.426
This disaster.

44:50.639 --> 44:52.512
- Which must be remedied.
- Expediently.

44:52.724 --> 44:53.612
I want my children.

44:53.638 --> 44:55.038
The stakes can be no higher.

44:55.226 --> 44:58.181
For me, sir, they could have sunk no lower.

44:58.207 --> 44:59.580
And I want my war!

44:59.772 --> 45:01.432
Blow him out of the water!

45:01.941 --> 45:04.064
Daddy's handling this. It's okay.

45:05.569 --> 45:06.851
Pick up your weapon.

45:11.909 --> 45:13.238
How much?

45:22.252 --> 45:24.577
Hoist and raise the kiddies!

45:32.179 --> 45:34.694
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Chairman.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.869
Fly up there...

45:36.058 --> 45:40.102
...and touch the fingers of your children, and I'll set them free.

45:40.437 --> 45:41.516
I can't fly.

45:41.729 --> 45:42.954
Explode out of there!

45:42.980 --> 45:44.062
Stop this charade!

45:44.088 --> 45:45.254
Free your children!

45:49.654 --> 45:51.279
I beg your pardon?

45:53.450 --> 45:54.825
You must be joking.

45:56.619 --> 46:00.451
Peter Pan has a real problem with heights.

46:01.165 --> 46:03.371
I'm not Peter Pan.

46:03.709 --> 46:05.504
It's okay. Hang on, son.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.399
I'm coming, sweetheart.

46:07.588 --> 46:09.233
Somebody give me a hand.

46:09.259 --> 46:10.698
I already have.

46:20.434 --> 46:21.809
Save us, Daddy!

46:22.019 --> 46:24.426
"Save me, Daddy!"

46:25.480 --> 46:26.831
We know who you are!

46:26.857 --> 46:29.289
What new game is this, Peter? Fly!

46:29.484 --> 46:31.477
Stop pretending!

46:34.614 --> 46:36.524
Fly! I know it's you!

46:42.163 --> 46:45.080
Be the Pan you are. Fly!

46:45.374 --> 46:47.201
Fly! Think a happy thought.

46:47.668 --> 46:51.582
Just touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.

46:52.048 --> 46:55.748
Touch them, Peter, and it's all been just a bad dream!

46:55.968 --> 46:58.424
Just reach out and touch them!

47:01.015 --> 47:03.054
Flap your arm and fly!

47:05.602 --> 47:07.013
Reach!

47:07.271 --> 47:08.231
Come on, Daddy.

47:08.257 --> 47:09.537
Mommy could do it.

47:14.445 --> 47:15.579
I don't understand.

47:15.605 --> 47:16.772
Why doesn't he fly?

47:16.798 --> 47:18.170
He's a fop Peter Pan!

47:18.365 --> 47:21.117
He's Peter Pan, all right, captain.

47:21.326 --> 47:25.703
He's been away from Never Land so long, his mind's been gentrified.

47:25.914 --> 47:27.990
He's forgotten everything.

47:33.839 --> 47:36.164
Please don't give up.

47:49.144 --> 47:50.769
I want to go home.

47:54.399 --> 47:58.896
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have decided to cancel the war.

48:00.030 --> 48:03.067
He can't fly, but he can swim!

48:03.575 --> 48:04.951
Kill them.

48:05.661 --> 48:06.823
Kill them all.

48:08.246 --> 48:09.740
Bring on the plank!

48:12.959 --> 48:17.040
And I never want to hear the name Peter Pan again!

48:19.508 --> 48:20.847
What about the name Hook?

48:20.873 --> 48:23.067
Do you want to be remembered as a bully?

48:23.261 --> 48:26.096
Or as the great warrior who defeated a heroic Pan?

48:28.307 --> 48:32.969
One week and I'll get him in shape, and you can have your dirty old war.

48:33.771 --> 48:35.219
It's a trick, captain!

48:35.245 --> 48:38.340
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell!

48:41.737 --> 48:43.979
You promised people the war of the century.

48:44.198 --> 48:47.733
Your whole life has been building to this. Mortal combat, glory!

48:47.993 --> 48:49.191
Hook versus Pan!

48:49.411 --> 48:51.867
That is not Pan.

49:05.594 --> 49:06.543
Two days.

49:07.095 --> 49:09.551
Four. Bare minimum for a decent Pan.

49:10.306 --> 49:11.421
Three. Final offer.

49:12.600 --> 49:13.763
Done.

49:15.394 --> 49:17.351
And you'd better deliver, Miss Bell...

49:17.563 --> 49:22.226
...or no amount of clapping will bring you back from where I will send you.

49:24.654 --> 49:25.603
Hear me, men.

49:25.822 --> 49:28.776
I've decided that the so-called Pan...

49:29.033 --> 49:32.484
...will return in three days to commence the arbitrament of the sword.

49:32.703 --> 49:33.818
Smee, translate.

49:34.038 --> 49:35.911
In three days we'll have a war.

49:36.123 --> 49:39.408
A battle between good and evil, to the death.

49:46.050 --> 49:47.758
Help me!

51:30.317 --> 51:31.515
Snow!

51:35.489 --> 51:36.734
What?

51:37.616 --> 51:38.861
What?

51:51.546 --> 51:52.791
Help!

51:58.011 --> 51:59.042
Get me down!

52:03.849 --> 52:05.427
Oh, you're alive!

52:05.893 --> 52:07.174
Oh, get me down!

52:07.520 --> 52:08.551
I believe!

52:08.771 --> 52:09.491
Lost Boys!

52:09.517 --> 52:10.955
Lost Boys!
Wake up!

52:18.197 --> 52:19.442
Pan's back!

52:19.698 --> 52:22.154
Lost Boys! Lost Boys! Wake up!

52:23.410 --> 52:25.283
That was my pillow!

52:26.579 --> 52:28.075
I'm up.

52:30.376 --> 52:32.582
Wake up, you sleepyheads!

52:33.086 --> 52:36.289
Pan's back!
Pan's back! Pan!

52:46.224 --> 52:47.468
Pan!

52:52.480 --> 52:54.888
Who's the shrub?

52:56.526 --> 52:57.771
Bangerang!

53:06.452 --> 53:08.076
That ain't Peter Pan.

53:08.328 --> 53:09.194
He's old.

53:09.455 --> 53:10.534
He's fat!

53:10.790 --> 53:12.498
Not so fat to me.

53:13.042 --> 53:15.959
He's an old, fat grandpa man.

53:21.675 --> 53:22.873
Rufio!

53:31.393 --> 53:33.267
That is so dangerous.

53:37.524 --> 53:39.931
That's enough!

53:40.944 --> 53:42.319
Okay, mister. All right.

53:42.528 --> 53:43.577
The show's over.

53:43.603 --> 53:45.044
Put that thing away!

53:45.239 --> 53:47.777
Put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.

53:47.992 --> 53:49.549
You're not old enough to shave.

53:49.575 --> 53:51.433
What are you doing with that sword?

53:51.621 --> 53:54.146
This is an insurance nightmare!
What's this?

53:54.172 --> 53:55.893
<i>Lord of the Flies</i> preschool?

53:56.501 --> 53:58.244
Where are your parents?

53:58.461 --> 54:00.287
Who's in charge here?

54:03.132 --> 54:07.081
No, Mr. Skunkhead-with-too-much-mousse, you're just a punk kid.

54:07.344 --> 54:09.383
I want to speak to a grownup!

54:09.638 --> 54:11.511
All grownups are pirates!

54:11.723 --> 54:12.554
Excuse me?

54:13.184 --> 54:14.975
We kill pirates.

54:16.270 --> 54:17.894
I'm not a pirate.

54:18.272 --> 54:20.845
It so happens I am a lawyer.

54:21.900 --> 54:23.939
Kill the lawyer!

54:24.861 --> 54:26.853
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

54:50.010 --> 54:51.884
I've been shot!

54:56.475 --> 54:57.507
Help!

54:57.727 --> 54:59.802
Help me, somebody!

55:04.816 --> 55:07.272
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!

55:07.486 --> 55:08.695
Hook's kidnapped his kids.

55:08.721 --> 55:09.883
He's just out of shape.

55:10.113 --> 55:12.438
We have to make him bangerang!

55:12.991 --> 55:14.983
No, no! Please stop!

55:16.370 --> 55:17.912
Why are you doing this to me?

55:18.372 --> 55:20.554
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.

55:20.580 --> 55:21.730
Please teach him.

55:21.917 --> 55:24.205
We gotta make him remember.

55:37.515 --> 55:38.345
Excuse me.

55:52.779 --> 55:54.060
Help me!

55:54.322 --> 55:56.114
Not you!

56:21.725 --> 56:23.053
Oh, my! A wall.

56:34.570 --> 56:36.858
Lost Boys, stop! Stop it!

56:43.829 --> 56:44.659
Play!

56:46.457 --> 56:47.571
Play.

57:11.564 --> 57:14.731
You're dead, jolly man.

57:15.359 --> 57:16.948
He can't do those things.

57:16.974 --> 57:19.133
He can't even play simple games.

57:19.363 --> 57:22.234
Hook has got his kids, and I've got three days...

57:22.450 --> 57:24.088
...to get him ready to fight.

57:24.114 --> 57:25.808
And I need everybody's help.

57:26.037 --> 57:29.370
Peter Pan's got kids?

57:36.922 --> 57:41.050
He can't fly, fight or crow.

57:43.053 --> 57:47.051
If any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan...

57:47.266 --> 57:48.511
...cross the line.

57:55.899 --> 57:58.187
What? I'll be right back.

57:59.444 --> 58:00.642
What?

58:00.862 --> 58:03.104
You are embarrassing me!

59:16.810 --> 59:19.266
Oh, there you are, Peter!

But, Peter...

59:39.958 --> 59:41.371
...you've grown up.

59:41.397 --> 59:43.850
You promised never to grow old.

59:48.592 --> 59:50.549
His nose got real big.

59:50.802 --> 59:54.467
Well, welcome back to Never Land, Pan the Man.

59:54.889 --> 59:58.009
Don't listen to that faerie and that brainless fungus!

59:58.267 --> 59:59.640
I got Pan's sword!

59:59.666 --> 01:00:00.961
I'm the Pan now!

01:00:01.187 --> 01:00:05.184
You think this guy's gonna take it from me? Rufio?

01:00:06.859 --> 01:00:10.524
Wait! If Tink believes, maybe he is.

01:00:16.118 --> 01:00:20.945
Are you gonna follow this drooler against <i>Capitan</i> Hook?

01:00:21.623 --> 01:00:24.796
What's he doing here if he's not Peter Pan, huh?

01:00:24.822 --> 01:00:26.440
He don't look happy here.

01:00:26.669 --> 01:00:28.560
And who are them kids Hook's got?

01:00:28.586 --> 01:00:29.732
Give him a chance!

01:00:29.965 --> 01:00:34.294
Those are my kids, and Hook's gonna kill them unless we do something.

01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:38.803
Help me. Please.

01:00:39.474 --> 01:00:40.551
Yeah, come on!

01:00:40.577 --> 01:00:42.037
Give him a chance!

01:00:48.149 --> 01:00:50.556
Well, I should claw myself with my own hook.

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:54.311
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance!

01:00:54.864 --> 01:00:56.160
What have I done?

01:00:56.186 --> 01:00:58.092
What have I done, Smee?

01:00:58.576 --> 01:01:02.075
Agreed to a preposterous plan, an absurd war.

01:01:02.329 --> 01:01:05.828
Now I'm bound by my indefatigable good form to wait.

01:01:06.083 --> 01:01:07.685
I'll fix you a nice plate.

01:01:07.711 --> 01:01:08.943
Wait for what?

01:01:09.169 --> 01:01:14.294
Whether it be three days or three decades, he'll always be a fat, old Pan.

01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.997
I hate being disappointed, Smee.

01:01:17.023 --> 01:01:19.612
And I hate living in this flawed body!

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:22.212
And I hate living in Never Land!

01:01:22.432 --> 01:01:24.555
And I hate, I hate...

01:01:24.809 --> 01:01:29.138
...I hate Peter Pan!

01:01:31.482 --> 01:01:34.899
Smee? Smee?

01:01:37.072 --> 01:01:39.741
I've just had a sublime vision.

01:01:44.328 --> 01:01:46.570
All the jagged parts of my life...

01:01:46.831 --> 01:01:51.457
...have come together to form a complete and mystical whole.

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:55.249
An epiphany.

01:01:56.132 --> 01:01:57.377
A "piphy" what?

01:01:58.509 --> 01:02:00.466
My life is over.

01:02:00.678 --> 01:02:01.958
You've lost your appetite?

01:02:02.388 --> 01:02:03.798
Yes.

01:02:04.056 --> 01:02:05.301
Goodbye.

01:02:06.683 --> 01:02:07.697
Where're you going?

01:02:07.723 --> 01:02:09.164
Are you getting dramatic?

01:02:09.352 --> 01:02:10.431
Goodbye, Smee.

01:02:10.687 --> 01:02:13.604
Captain, why don't we play with your island?

01:02:14.148 --> 01:02:17.981
All the little Indians and the soldiers and all the Lost Boys?

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:20.443
Here we go.

01:02:22.198 --> 01:02:25.283
No stopping me this time, Smee.

01:02:25.535 --> 01:02:26.649
This is it.

01:02:26.869 --> 01:02:30.119
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.

01:02:30.539 --> 01:02:32.363
My finger's on the trigger.

01:02:32.389 --> 01:02:34.348
Don't try to stop me, Smee.

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.784
Oh, not again.

01:02:36.004 --> 01:02:36.834
This is it.

01:02:37.172 --> 01:02:39.626
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.

01:02:39.652 --> 01:02:42.238
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.646
Don't you dare try to stop me this time, Smee.

01:02:45.672 --> 01:02:46.698
Try to stop me.

01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.954
You better get up off your ass.

01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.916
Get over here!

01:02:51.143 --> 01:02:52.601
- I'm coming!
- Stop me!

01:02:52.811 --> 01:02:54.286
This is not a joke!

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:56.252
I'm committing suicide!

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:02.602
Don't ever frighten me like that again.

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:04.648
- Sorry.
- What are you, a sadist?

01:03:04.865 --> 01:03:06.738
I'm sorry. How do you feel now?

01:03:07.367 --> 01:03:09.822
- I want to die.
- Oh, now, now.

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:11.224
There's no adventure here.

01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:12.848
You call this "no adventure"?

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.281
Death is the only great adventure I have left.

01:03:15.541 --> 01:03:17.119
Let's get you into bed.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.415
It's all over.

01:03:18.628 --> 01:03:19.490
I'm so tired.

01:03:19.516 --> 01:03:21.903
Don't upset yourself, captain.

01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:24.705
My career is over.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:27.838
This was supposed to be the war to end all wars.

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:29.603
And it will be, captain.

01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:31.074
The ultimate war.

01:03:33.475 --> 01:03:37.224
There must be a way to get at him, to get even with him...

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:40.185
...to get him where it really would hurt.

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:44.479
There must be something I haven't thought of. Where is he vulnerable?

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:48.487
No more talk about doing away with yourself.

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:52.192
I mean, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?

01:03:52.786 --> 01:03:54.909
Indeed. Good form, Smee.

01:03:55.372 --> 01:03:58.339
What would the world be like without me?

01:03:58.365 --> 01:03:59.774
There you go.

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.828
I'm ready for my nightcap.

01:04:02.087 --> 01:04:04.792
Abso-flogging-lutely.

01:04:05.006 --> 01:04:07.580
I think a bit of skulduggery would do you good.

01:04:07.801 --> 01:04:10.588
Take your mind off this Pan business.

01:04:10.803 --> 01:04:14.801
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll shoot some Indians out at Long Tom.

01:04:15.016 --> 01:04:17.541
I'm tired of killing Indians and Lost Boys.

01:04:17.567 --> 01:04:18.741
I always kill them.

01:04:18.978 --> 01:04:20.542
I want to kill Peter Pan.

01:04:20.568 --> 01:04:21.755
I wanna kill him!

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:24.513
Hear me? 
I want to kill him.

01:04:24.734 --> 01:04:26.394
Oh, dear.

01:04:35.536 --> 01:04:37.160
I've just had an apostrophe.

01:04:37.371 --> 01:04:39.410
I think you mean an "epiphany."

01:04:39.831 --> 01:04:42.786
Lightning has just struck my brain.

01:04:43.043 --> 01:04:44.751
Well, that must hurt.

01:04:44.962 --> 01:04:47.879
- Pan's kids...
- What about them?

01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:54.094
You could make them like you.

01:04:55.013 --> 01:04:56.044
Say, what?

01:04:56.264 --> 01:04:58.303
No, no, no.

01:05:03.063 --> 01:05:06.681
We could make the little buggers love you.

01:05:07.567 --> 01:05:10.484
No little children love me.

01:05:10.695 --> 01:05:12.450
Captain, that is the point.

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:13.970
What do you mean?

01:05:14.156 --> 01:05:17.240
That is the ultimate revenge.

01:05:17.451 --> 01:05:20.238
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.

01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:21.865
What're you getting on about?

01:05:22.122 --> 01:05:24.199
- It's the ultimate payback.
- What is?

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:25.615
Imagine Pan...

01:05:25.877 --> 01:05:29.210
...when he faces you, and his kids...

01:05:29.421 --> 01:05:30.832
...standing beside you...

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.965
...ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the seven seas, Captain Hook.

01:05:36.219 --> 01:05:39.802
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.

01:05:40.473 --> 01:05:41.671
You know, Smee...

01:05:41.933 --> 01:05:45.718
...I like it, I like it, I like it!

01:05:45.938 --> 01:05:48.808
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea I've just had!

01:05:49.066 --> 01:05:52.565
Tomorrow, I'll make Pan's brats love me.

01:05:52.819 --> 01:05:54.495
Peter Pan will fly again.

01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:55.928
He'll remember how.

01:05:56.155 --> 01:05:59.820
And if he doesn't, those dirty Lost Boys will jog his memory.

01:06:00.034 --> 01:06:01.518
Oh, yes, you'll see.

01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:04.436
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly...

01:06:04.622 --> 01:06:07.540
...and then, he'll die.

01:06:17.134 --> 01:06:18.379
<i>Pick 'em up</i>

01:06:18.635 --> 01:06:20.046
<i>Move 'em down</i>

01:06:20.345 --> 01:06:21.804
<i>Pick 'em on up</i>

01:06:22.014 --> 01:06:23.721
<i>Move 'em on down</i>

01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:27.017
<i>Ain't no time to celebrate</i>

01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:30.305
<i>You are old and overweight</i>

01:06:30.606 --> 01:06:33.642
<i>Gotta lose a million pounds</i>

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:36.046
<i>Get your fat butt off the ground</i>

01:06:36.072 --> 01:06:38.462
<i>Reach on down and touch your toes</i>

01:06:38.697 --> 01:06:42.030
<i>How long since you looked at those?</i>

01:06:42.283 --> 01:06:43.564
<i>Shape up</i>

01:06:43.785 --> 01:06:45.279
<i>Lose weight</i>

01:06:45.494 --> 01:06:46.823
<i>Get thin</i>

01:06:47.038 --> 01:06:47.868
<i>Gotta win</i>

01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:50.397
<i>Jumping jacks are good for you</i>

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.815
<i>Now your face is turning blue</i>

01:06:53.044 --> 01:06:56.080
<i>Swing your arms around your back</i>

01:06:56.297 --> 01:06:59.298
<i>Give yourself a heart attack</i>
<i>Gotta train</i>

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:01.092
<i>In the rain</i>

01:07:01.343 --> 01:07:02.588
<i>In the sun</i>

01:07:02.845 --> 01:07:04.422
<i>In the snow</i>

01:07:04.638 --> 01:07:06.844
<i>Ten below</i>
<i>Gotta move</i>

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:08.766
<i>Gotta do</i>
<i>Gotta grow</i>

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:12.809
Go easy on me. I'm a beginner.

01:07:13.022 --> 01:07:14.220
Low! High! High!

01:07:18.068 --> 01:07:19.269
All right, gramps.

01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:20.963
Give it your best shot.

01:07:21.196 --> 01:07:23.568
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen. Learn.

01:07:23.949 --> 01:07:24.810
Okay, you ready?

01:07:24.836 --> 01:07:26.180
I don't wanna hurt you.

01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:31.872
Watch your skin!

01:07:32.207 --> 01:07:33.370
Be bangerang, old man.

01:07:46.637 --> 01:07:47.666
What are you doing?

01:07:47.692 --> 01:07:49.912
How does this help me get my kids back?

01:07:50.100 --> 01:07:51.510
What do I have to do next?

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:56.264
Next, time to fly.

01:08:02.403 --> 01:08:06.021
Just think happy thoughts.

01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:10.189
All you need is one happy thought, Peter, and it'll make you fly.

01:08:11.203 --> 01:08:12.662
I got it!

01:08:13.372 --> 01:08:16.953
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!

01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:20.287
He's going up!

01:08:20.545 --> 01:08:22.870
He's coming down!

01:08:26.175 --> 01:08:28.031
Now, pay attention, class.

01:08:28.057 --> 01:08:29.984
We have a lot to go over.

01:08:30.179 --> 01:08:35.008
"Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children."

01:08:37.562 --> 01:08:38.760
Anyone?

01:08:39.606 --> 01:08:41.977
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?

01:08:42.233 --> 01:08:46.444
You, the cute little urchin in the front row...

01:08:47.112 --> 01:08:50.777
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?

01:08:50.991 --> 01:08:51.821
Yes.

01:08:52.033 --> 01:08:54.786
I said Mommy reads to us every night...

01:08:54.996 --> 01:08:57.487
...because she loves us very much.

01:08:57.707 --> 01:08:59.366
Loves you?
Isn't that...

01:09:00.584 --> 01:09:02.707
The "L" word, captain.

01:09:03.545 --> 01:09:04.411
No, child.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:09.375
Your mother reads to you every night in order to stupefy you to sleep...

01:09:09.676 --> 01:09:13.673
...so that she and Daddy can sit down for three minutes without you...

01:09:13.930 --> 01:09:19.006
...and your mindless, inexhaustible, unstoppable, repetitive demands:

01:09:19.269 --> 01:09:20.846
"He took my toy."

01:09:21.104 --> 01:09:22.349
"She hid my bear."

01:09:22.604 --> 01:09:24.996
"I want to potty. I want a cookie.

01:09:25.022 --> 01:09:26.497
I want to stay up."

01:09:26.734 --> 01:09:27.787
"I want, I want, I

01:09:27.813 --> 01:09:29.332
want!" "Me, me, me, me!"

01:09:29.528 --> 01:09:31.484
"Mine, mine, mine, mine!"

01:09:31.697 --> 01:09:34.698
"Now, now, now!"

01:09:34.908 --> 01:09:37.743
Can't you understand, child?

01:09:38.203 --> 01:09:40.750
They tell you stories to shut you up.

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:42.357
And conk you out.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:46.201
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!

01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.792
Lie? Me?

01:09:50.756 --> 01:09:52.335
Never!

01:09:53.260 --> 01:09:56.345
The truth is far too much fun.

01:09:59.058 --> 01:10:04.182
Before you were born, your parents would stay up all night together...

01:10:04.521 --> 01:10:06.099
...just to see the sunrise.

01:10:06.356 --> 01:10:07.435
Don't be frightened.

01:10:07.649 --> 01:10:12.773
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.

01:10:13.446 --> 01:10:15.189
They were free.

01:10:16.198 --> 01:10:18.904
You are a bad man.

01:10:19.119 --> 01:10:20.910
Smee, flunk the maggot.

01:10:21.204 --> 01:10:22.698
Abso-flogging-lutely.

01:10:22.956 --> 01:10:24.663
An "F"?

01:10:27.376 --> 01:10:29.452
He gave me an "F"!

01:10:31.964 --> 01:10:35.167
Your father went to your sister's school play, did he not?

01:10:35.926 --> 01:10:39.260
But did he go to your baseball game?

01:10:41.932 --> 01:10:43.427
How'd you know about that?

01:10:43.684 --> 01:10:48.227
He missed the most important game on the most important day...

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.722
...of your young life.

01:10:52.526 --> 01:10:54.648
- I wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.

01:10:54.861 --> 01:10:57.316
I hate, I hate you, Mr. Hook!

01:10:58.114 --> 01:10:59.573
What did I tell you, Smee?

01:10:59.599 --> 01:11:01.224
No little children love me.

01:11:01.451 --> 01:11:02.649
Of course they do.

01:11:02.911 --> 01:11:05.236
Come on.
You're depressing the captain.

01:11:05.455 --> 01:11:06.701
Jack, listen to me!

01:11:06.727 --> 01:11:09.809
Never let him make you forget!
Never forget...

01:11:10.001 --> 01:11:11.376
...Mommy and Daddy!

01:11:11.586 --> 01:11:15.001
Think of a way to run home, Jack!
Run home!

01:11:15.214 --> 01:11:16.412
Run home?

01:11:20.637 --> 01:11:22.428
You are home.

01:11:25.308 --> 01:11:26.470
Right?

01:11:41.699 --> 01:11:43.490
Oh, yeah.

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:12.681
No, no, no.
We don't use them.

01:12:12.895 --> 01:12:14.221
Why do you have them?

01:12:14.247 --> 01:12:16.455
So we don't have to use them.

01:12:17.233 --> 01:12:19.355
Don't crowd me!

01:12:19.735 --> 01:12:21.145
Come on, Thud Butt!

01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:34.405
Everybody say grace.

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:35.454
Bless this, Lord...

01:12:35.667 --> 01:12:37.292
Grace!

01:12:46.553 --> 01:12:48.593
All of my favorite Never Foods!

01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:52.844
Yams, mamey apples and banana squash!

01:12:53.184 --> 01:12:57.312
Wash it down, calabash and papaw!

01:13:01.484 --> 01:13:03.143
Can you blow on this?

01:13:04.028 --> 01:13:04.894
Thank you.

01:13:29.803 --> 01:13:31.677
This is good!

01:13:44.525 --> 01:13:46.067
Are you eating that?

01:13:48.363 --> 01:13:50.071
No, please.

01:13:51.074 --> 01:13:52.070
Eat!

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:53.280
What's the deal?

01:13:53.306 --> 01:13:54.551
Where's the real food?

01:13:54.744 --> 01:13:58.991
If you can't imagine yourself being Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!

01:13:59.206 --> 01:14:00.739
Eat what? There's nothing here.

01:14:00.765 --> 01:14:02.149
Gandhi ate more than this.

01:14:02.334 --> 01:14:04.492
This used to be your favorite game.

01:14:04.711 --> 01:14:05.684
Forget the games.

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:06.714
I want real food!

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.655
Steak, eggs...

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.585
You can't.
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat bag!

01:14:12.845 --> 01:14:14.120
You're very ill-mannered...

01:14:14.146 --> 01:14:15.657
You're a slug-eating worm.

01:14:15.848 --> 01:14:17.223
You can do better than that!

01:14:17.599 --> 01:14:18.714
You're encouraging them?

01:14:18.934 --> 01:14:21.206
Show me your fastball, dust brain!

01:14:21.232 --> 01:14:23.704
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!

01:14:23.938 --> 01:14:25.978
Bangerang, Rufio!

01:14:26.191 --> 01:14:29.109
You're a very poor role model for these kids, you know?

01:14:32.406 --> 01:14:34.445
You don't have a fourth-grade reading level.

01:14:34.658 --> 01:14:35.753
Hemorrhoidal sucknavel.

01:14:35.779 --> 01:14:37.683
Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:44.281
Oil-dripping, beef-fart sniffing bubble butt.

01:14:46.419 --> 01:14:47.969
Someone has a severe caca mouth.

01:14:47.995 --> 01:14:48.769
You know that?

01:14:48.963 --> 01:14:50.588
You are a fart factory!

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.339
Slug-slime sack of rat guts and cat vomit...

01:14:54.594 --> 01:14:55.792
...cheesy scab...

01:14:56.012 --> 01:14:58.337
...picked pimple-squeezing finger bandage!

01:14:58.556 --> 01:15:03.680
A week-old maggot burger with everything on it and flies on the side!

01:15:05.937 --> 01:15:07.515
Substitute chemistry teacher.

01:15:07.731 --> 01:15:09.937
Come on, Rufio, hit him back.

01:15:10.693 --> 01:15:11.523
Mung tongue!

01:15:12.862 --> 01:15:14.937
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.

01:15:15.823 --> 01:15:17.198
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.

01:15:17.407 --> 01:15:18.522
Nearsighted gynecologist.

01:15:18.742 --> 01:15:19.825
In your face, camelcake!

01:15:19.851 --> 01:15:21.340
In your rear, cow derrière!

01:15:21.536 --> 01:15:23.576
Lying, crying, spying, prying ultra-pig!

01:15:23.788 --> 01:15:25.745
Lewd, crude bag of pre-chewed food dude.

01:15:25.957 --> 01:15:27.617
Bangerang, Peter!

01:15:30.628 --> 01:15:33.202
You man! Stupid, stupid man!

01:15:33.423 --> 01:15:36.293
If I'm a maggot burger, why don't you just eat me?

01:15:36.885 --> 01:15:40.716
You zebra-headed, slime-coated, pimple-farming, paramecium brain...

01:15:40.972 --> 01:15:44.720
...munching on your own mucus, suffering from Peter Pan envy!

01:15:44.934 --> 01:15:46.344
What's a "paramecium brain"?

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:48.374
I'll tell you what a paramecium is!

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.539
That's a paramecium!

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:53.016
It's a one-celled critter with no brain that can't fly!

01:15:53.276 --> 01:15:54.969
Don't mess with me, man!

01:15:54.995 --> 01:15:56.052
I'm a lawyer!

01:15:56.237 --> 01:15:58.028
Banning, Banning!

01:16:02.951 --> 01:16:05.524
Rufio! Rufio!

01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:15.874
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?

01:16:24.055 --> 01:16:25.633
You're doing it.

01:16:26.057 --> 01:16:30.006
- Doing what?
- Using your imagination, Peter.

01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:58.965
You're playing with us, Peter.

01:16:58.991 --> 01:17:01.319
You're doing it, Peter.

01:17:22.445 --> 01:17:24.651
Drink your papaw, Peter.

01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:27.568
How is it?

01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:30.076
Bangerang.

01:17:32.246 --> 01:17:33.823
Catch!

01:17:41.589 --> 01:17:42.999
Hey, Pockets...

01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:44.455
...catch!

01:17:45.175 --> 01:17:47.382
Oh, Don't Ask!

01:18:01.316 --> 01:18:03.225
Bangerang!

01:18:11.075 --> 01:18:13.281
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!

01:18:13.494 --> 01:18:14.609
Peter, look out!

01:18:14.829 --> 01:18:15.694
Peter, watch out!

01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:50.069
Bangerang.

01:19:06.004 --> 01:19:07.462
Peter...

01:19:07.922 --> 01:19:09.796
...can I talk to you?

01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:11.627
Sure, Thud.

01:19:13.135 --> 01:19:15.377
- I remember Tootles.
- You do?

01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:17.138
He was lost too.

01:19:17.973 --> 01:19:19.515
How could you know Tootles?

01:19:19.933 --> 01:19:22.009
He was a Lost Boy.

01:19:22.353 --> 01:19:24.559
These are his marbles.

01:19:26.315 --> 01:19:28.936
These are his happy thoughts.

01:19:36.283 --> 01:19:38.380
He really did lose his marbles.

01:19:38.406 --> 01:19:40.435
Yeah, he lost them good.

01:19:42.789 --> 01:19:44.581
Peter, you know what?

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.710
My happy thought will help you.

01:19:48.712 --> 01:19:50.289
What's your happy thought?

01:19:51.297 --> 01:19:53.539
Mine's my mother.

01:19:54.259 --> 01:19:57.045
Do you remember your mother, Peter?

01:19:57.512 --> 01:19:58.970
Wish I could.

01:20:01.223 --> 01:20:02.967
Listen.

01:20:19.366 --> 01:20:20.694
My mom sang that song.

01:20:20.951 --> 01:20:24.236
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball.

01:20:24.496 --> 01:20:25.731
I can't remember.

01:20:25.757 --> 01:20:29.314
Are the mates standing or are they on horseback?

01:20:31.336 --> 01:20:36.212
<i>The stars are all my friends</i>

01:20:36.466 --> 01:20:40.333
<i>Till the nighttime ends</i>

01:20:40.553 --> 01:20:44.420
<i>So I know I'm not alone</i>

01:20:45.016 --> 01:20:48.884
<i>When I'm here on my own</i>

01:20:49.896 --> 01:20:53.763
<i>Isn't that a wonder</i>

01:20:54.525 --> 01:20:57.811
<i>When you're alone</i>

01:20:58.779 --> 01:21:02.397
<i>You're not alone</i>

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:07.783
<i>Not really alone</i>

01:21:52.165 --> 01:21:55.119
Good night, Never Land!

01:22:33.371 --> 01:22:34.839
What is it? I hear it.

01:22:34.865 --> 01:22:36.065
I hear it again.

01:22:37.625 --> 01:22:40.294
Smee, it's that crocodile, back from the dead!

01:22:41.462 --> 01:22:45.756
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!

01:22:45.966 --> 01:22:47.840
Is that the clock?

01:22:50.345 --> 01:22:51.989
You killed that croc years ago.

01:22:52.015 --> 01:22:53.657
We smash every clock we find.

01:22:53.850 --> 01:22:56.056
Little elf didn't know any better.

01:22:58.771 --> 01:23:00.479
To the museum, at once.

01:23:14.411 --> 01:23:19.156
Shine 'em up! Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg, right here!

01:23:32.553 --> 01:23:34.463
Broken clocks...

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:39.431
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.

01:23:40.353 --> 01:23:41.728
Just listen.

01:23:41.937 --> 01:23:43.597
I don't hear anything.

01:23:44.023 --> 01:23:47.226
I know! Good form! Exactly!

01:23:47.443 --> 01:23:50.360
Jack, you see this? Come over here.

01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:51.733
You can take it.

01:23:51.947 --> 01:23:54.412
This is Barbecue's very own bedside clock.

01:23:54.438 --> 01:23:56.433
He was quite an infamous pirate.

01:23:56.619 --> 01:24:00.367
I smashed this clock immediately after I gutted him.

01:24:00.581 --> 01:24:02.538
His ship made a pretty bonfire!

01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:05.708
Such a pretty, pretty...

01:24:11.716 --> 01:24:14.919
What is that I hear?

01:24:16.513 --> 01:24:18.007
A ticking?

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.557
Smee, stop the ticking!

01:24:23.311 --> 01:24:26.146
Stop that! Stop that "tick-tick"!

01:24:26.731 --> 01:24:28.020
There's no ticking here.

01:24:28.046 --> 01:24:29.709
There's nothing left to tick.

01:24:31.443 --> 01:24:33.650
Oh, my God!

01:24:34.029 --> 01:24:38.608
This is for the ticking that might have been.

01:24:39.785 --> 01:24:41.577
Get his father's watch!

01:24:44.540 --> 01:24:45.950
Go on.

01:24:46.208 --> 01:24:47.951
You know you want to.

01:24:48.210 --> 01:24:49.918
Give it a try.

01:24:51.004 --> 01:24:52.202
Go on.

01:24:52.464 --> 01:24:54.088
This is for...

01:24:54.758 --> 01:24:57.509
...never letting me blow bubbles in my chocolate milk!

01:24:59.471 --> 01:25:00.901
Good form! Bravo!

01:25:00.927 --> 01:25:03.196
Isn't that wonderful?

01:25:03.391 --> 01:25:06.725
This is for never letting me jump on my own bed!

01:25:07.729 --> 01:25:10.683
Make time stand still, laddie.

01:25:10.898 --> 01:25:14.563
For always making promises and breaking them!

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.019
For never doing anything with me.

01:25:18.615 --> 01:25:21.402
For a father who's never there, Jack?

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.283
Jack, for a father who didn't save you on the ship.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:31.034
Who wouldn't save us...

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:33.410
Who couldn't save you, Jack.

01:25:33.879 --> 01:25:36.833
He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.

01:25:37.090 --> 01:25:41.005
He was there, we were there, and he wouldn't try.

01:25:43.597 --> 01:25:45.424
Jack...

01:25:45.641 --> 01:25:46.886
...he will try.

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:50.843
And the question will be:

01:25:51.104 --> 01:25:54.639
When the time comes, do you want to be saved?

01:25:56.067 --> 01:25:58.143
Now, don't you answer now.
No, no, no, no.

01:25:58.736 --> 01:26:02.485
Now it's time to be whatever you want to be.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:06.072
Put behind you any thoughts of home...

01:26:06.327 --> 01:26:09.114
...that place of broken promises.

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:11.195
That what?

01:26:12.583 --> 01:26:15.667
Have I ever made a promise, Jack...

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:19.169
...I have not kept?

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.550
Have I, son?

01:26:51.788 --> 01:26:53.615
Come on. Let's go!

01:27:02.965 --> 01:27:04.128
I don't like this game.

01:27:04.342 --> 01:27:07.343
"Steal Hook's hook As fast as you can."

01:27:07.595 --> 01:27:09.386
"It'll make you proud."

01:27:09.889 --> 01:27:12.676
"Then you crow like Pan."

01:27:12.892 --> 01:27:15.152
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.

01:27:15.178 --> 01:27:17.163
The game is about to start.

01:27:23.985 --> 01:27:27.153
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.

01:27:32.035 --> 01:27:34.608
Steal Hook's hook, then crow!

01:27:54.807 --> 01:27:56.385
Jackie, boy! Jack!

01:27:57.268 --> 01:28:00.518
This is for all the games your daddy missed.

01:28:00.729 --> 01:28:03.516
Hook would never miss your game, son.

01:28:03.732 --> 01:28:05.226
You're almost there. Take it.

01:28:05.484 --> 01:28:06.813
What's he looking at?

01:28:06.839 --> 01:28:08.925
Come on, you're this close!

01:28:09.155 --> 01:28:10.565
What's wrong?

01:28:10.781 --> 01:28:13.023
- Grab it, come on.
- Grab it, Peter!

01:28:14.368 --> 01:28:15.743
Come on, Jack.

01:28:16.829 --> 01:28:18.239
And one!

01:28:30.676 --> 01:28:32.585
Wait for the good pitches.

01:28:32.803 --> 01:28:34.629
Wait for the good pitches!

01:28:41.269 --> 01:28:43.022
Jack! Jack!
He's our man.

01:28:43.048 --> 01:28:45.291
If he can't do it, no one can!

01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:48.269
He's stealing second!

01:28:53.072 --> 01:28:54.732
No, now stop it!

01:28:54.991 --> 01:28:58.822
We're playing this game according to Master Jack's rules! Bad form!

01:28:59.078 --> 01:28:59.978
Sit down now!

01:29:00.004 --> 01:29:01.594
Let's resume the game!

01:29:01.789 --> 01:29:03.864
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?

01:29:08.962 --> 01:29:10.374
Come on, Jack!

01:29:11.006 --> 01:29:12.338
Run home, Jack!

01:29:12.364 --> 01:29:13.783
Run home, Jack!

01:29:21.266 --> 01:29:22.926
"Run home, Jack."

01:29:23.143 --> 01:29:24.669
Smee, no, no, no!

01:29:24.695 --> 01:29:27.117
They've got it backwards!

01:29:27.313 --> 01:29:28.973
Tell them to turn it around!

01:29:29.232 --> 01:29:30.477
Maggie?

01:29:31.234 --> 01:29:32.693
Switch!

01:29:37.657 --> 01:29:40.047
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack!

01:29:40.073 --> 01:29:41.382
Home run, Jack!

01:29:42.078 --> 01:29:44.615
Home run, Jack. Home run, Jack.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:54.789
He can't hit the curve.

01:30:20.323 --> 01:30:22.280
My Jack!

01:30:24.494 --> 01:30:25.608
My Jack.

01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:36.257
You did it!

01:30:36.283 --> 01:30:37.982
Hoist him up!

01:30:42.219 --> 01:30:43.778
That's my boy!

01:30:43.804 --> 01:30:45.695
You did it, son!

01:31:23.468 --> 01:31:24.499
Gotta fly!

01:31:25.386 --> 01:31:26.666
Happy thought.

01:31:26.929 --> 01:31:31.140
Happy thought, happy thought, happy thought, happy...

01:31:31.433 --> 01:31:33.841
One great, big happy thought!

01:31:34.269 --> 01:31:35.728
Less is more.

01:31:38.191 --> 01:31:39.471
I can!

01:33:10.905 --> 01:33:14.772
"Tootles. Wendy. John.

01:33:15.034 --> 01:33:17.607
Michael. Peter."

01:33:40.183 --> 01:33:41.402
Be careful, Peter.

01:33:41.428 --> 01:33:44.206
You're a lot taller than you used to be.

01:33:45.397 --> 01:33:47.105
Well, say something.

01:33:49.484 --> 01:33:51.275
Do you like my dress?

01:33:56.115 --> 01:33:57.858
You look beautiful.

01:34:03.331 --> 01:34:05.240
What's the occasion?

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:06.913
You are.

01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.834
It's a welcome-home party.

01:34:15.759 --> 01:34:17.134
What happened here?

01:34:17.344 --> 01:34:18.624
Hook.

01:34:18.845 --> 01:34:20.719
Burnt it when you didn't come back.

01:34:41.617 --> 01:34:42.993
Kiss.

01:34:48.500 --> 01:34:49.875
Wendy.

01:34:53.212 --> 01:34:54.872
This is Wendy's house.

01:34:55.131 --> 01:34:57.170
Tootles and Nibs built it for her.

01:35:00.177 --> 01:35:01.802
I remember.

01:35:03.889 --> 01:35:05.597
Wendy would sit in that chair.

01:35:07.059 --> 01:35:08.518
But it wasn't there.

01:35:08.544 --> 01:35:09.492
It was here.

01:35:10.604 --> 01:35:14.222
We used to sit here while she'd darn socks and tell us stories.

01:35:15.484 --> 01:35:17.192
She slept here.

01:35:17.903 --> 01:35:19.860
Tink, your apartment was right here.

01:35:20.071 --> 01:35:21.316
Yes.

01:35:21.948 --> 01:35:25.946
Little Michael in his basket bed, right here.

01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:28.115
John.

01:35:36.254 --> 01:35:39.420
Teddy. My Teddy.

01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:47.636
Mother used to put him in the pram to keep me company.

01:35:53.271 --> 01:35:55.263
I remember my mother.

01:35:56.482 --> 01:35:58.273
I remember her.

01:36:00.569 --> 01:36:03.854
You can be sure, very fine schools indeed.

01:36:04.489 --> 01:36:08.273
First, he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford.

01:36:08.535 --> 01:36:09.449
And of course...

01:36:09.662 --> 01:36:14.656
...after graduation, he will prepare for a judgeship in the highest court...

01:36:14.917 --> 01:36:19.459
...making time for marriage and family and all of that.

01:36:19.671 --> 01:36:20.999
Just like his father.

01:36:21.256 --> 01:36:23.794
<i>Isn't that what grownups want for their children?</i>

01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.748
<i>I was afraid.</i>

01:36:24.774 --> 01:36:26.114
<i>I didn't wanna grow up.</i>

01:36:26.302 --> 01:36:29.338
<i>Everybody who grows up has to die someday.</i>

01:36:29.639 --> 01:36:31.431
<i>So I ran away.</i>

01:36:42.109 --> 01:36:43.354
<i>Tink...</i>

01:36:44.653 --> 01:36:46.860
<i>... you came and you saved me.</i>

01:36:47.531 --> 01:36:49.714
<i>You brought me to Never Land.</i>

01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.471
<i>You taught me to fly.</i>

01:36:54.246 --> 01:36:58.540
<i>But I was still a little boy, and I missed my mother.</i>

01:36:58.959 --> 01:37:02.292
<i>So I decided to fly home to my very own window.</i>

01:37:03.255 --> 01:37:04.120
<i>But it was shut.</i>

01:37:05.590 --> 01:37:06.965
<i>They'd forgotten about me.</i>

01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:16.466
<i>I found other windows to visit, ones that weren't shut closed on me.</i>

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.438
<i>That's how I met Wendy.</i>

01:37:18.464 --> 01:37:20.620
<i>I chased my shadow in her nursery.</i>

01:37:20.814 --> 01:37:25.226
<i>I expected my shadow and I would join together like drops of water.</i>

01:37:35.745 --> 01:37:37.323
Boy!

01:37:40.041 --> 01:37:41.832
Why are you crying?

01:37:44.169 --> 01:37:45.794
What's your name?

01:37:46.964 --> 01:37:50.664
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?

01:37:51.051 --> 01:37:53.532
<i>I came back many times for Wendy.</i>

01:37:53.558 --> 01:37:55.288
<i>Always in the spring.</i>

01:37:58.058 --> 01:38:00.264
<i>And Wendy kept getting older...</i>

01:38:00.936 --> 01:38:01.967
<i>... and older.</i>

01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:06.096
<i>And then I came back the last time.</i>

01:38:06.399 --> 01:38:09.006
Peter, I can't come with you.

01:38:09.032 --> 01:38:11.549
I've forgotten how to fly.

01:38:12.655 --> 01:38:14.862
I'm old, Peter.

01:38:15.784 --> 01:38:18.191
Ever so much more than 20.

01:38:19.079 --> 01:38:21.652
- I grew up a long time ago.
- No, no, no!

01:38:21.873 --> 01:38:24.079
- You promised!
- I have children of my own now.

01:38:24.333 --> 01:38:26.824
They have children of their own.

01:38:27.044 --> 01:38:31.587
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.916
<i>When I saw her lying there sleeping...</i>

01:38:34.134 --> 01:38:37.171
<i>... at that moment, something changed in me forever.</i>

01:38:37.388 --> 01:38:39.464
I shall give her a kiss.

01:38:40.808 --> 01:38:44.058
No! No, Peter!
No buttons, no thimbles.

01:38:44.311 --> 01:38:48.640
I couldn't bear her heart to be broken when she finds she can't keep you.

01:38:51.151 --> 01:38:52.182
No.

01:38:53.903 --> 01:38:56.858
I mean a real kiss.

01:39:20.805 --> 01:39:23.889
I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.

01:39:25.351 --> 01:39:28.055
So many sad memories, Peter.

01:39:29.688 --> 01:39:31.396
Bye, Teddy.

01:39:33.442 --> 01:39:36.727
Not Teddy. Daddy!

01:39:37.529 --> 01:39:38.692
Daddy!

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.533
Peter, you're a daddy.

01:39:48.498 --> 01:39:49.328
Hi, Jack.

01:39:49.541 --> 01:39:51.208
<i>I know why I came back.</i>

01:39:51.234 --> 01:39:52.899
<i>I know why I grew up.</i>

01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:56.623
<i>I wanted to be a father.</i>

01:39:57.089 --> 01:39:58.714
I'm a daddy.

01:40:01.094 --> 01:40:02.802
My happy thought.

01:40:03.722 --> 01:40:04.966
I got it!

01:40:05.181 --> 01:40:07.672
I got it! I found it!

01:40:10.102 --> 01:40:10.932
I lost it!

01:40:12.688 --> 01:40:15.393
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!

01:40:42.676 --> 01:40:44.336
Peter Pan!

01:41:11.579 --> 01:41:13.488
He's back! He's back!

01:41:13.706 --> 01:41:15.248
He's back!

01:42:09.677 --> 01:42:10.756
Play!

01:42:11.011 --> 01:42:12.589
Play!

01:42:40.581 --> 01:42:42.206
You are the Pan.

01:43:02.936 --> 01:43:07.016
You can fly, you can fight, and you can...

01:43:54.362 --> 01:43:55.772
Tink, you in there?

01:43:59.533 --> 01:44:00.696
Are you sad?

01:44:00.951 --> 01:44:02.990
No, I'm neither. Please go away.

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.531
Oh, you're sick.

01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:06.016
You need a Band-Aid.

01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:06.931
Or a thermometer!

01:44:07.123 --> 01:44:09.697
That's how Nibs made the Wendy lady better.

01:44:09.918 --> 01:44:12.456
Oh, no, Peter! It's not about that!

01:44:12.671 --> 01:44:13.536
Yes, it is!

01:44:13.755 --> 01:44:16.425
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.

01:44:17.509 --> 01:44:18.920
Felt all better.

01:44:21.429 --> 01:44:23.256
Don't we have the greatest adventures?

01:44:25.141 --> 01:44:28.510
Do you remember your next great adventure to save your kids?

01:44:29.311 --> 01:44:30.805
Kids?

01:44:32.315 --> 01:44:34.058
Peter Pan's got kids?

01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:36.735
Why are you in Never Land?

01:44:36.944 --> 01:44:39.020
To always be a little boy and have fun.

01:44:39.238 --> 01:44:40.541
I like this game.

01:44:40.567 --> 01:44:42.098
Ask me another one.

01:44:56.547 --> 01:44:58.255
Oh, dear me! I did it.

01:44:58.507 --> 01:45:00.478
Tink, look what happened!

01:45:00.504 --> 01:45:02.316
You broke your house.

01:45:05.221 --> 01:45:06.799
You're humongous.

01:45:09.017 --> 01:45:11.887
This is the only wish I ever wished for myself.

01:45:13.354 --> 01:45:16.106
This is the biggest feeling I've ever, ever felt.

01:45:16.358 --> 01:45:21.268
And this is the first time I've been big enough to have it.

01:45:22.155 --> 01:45:25.654
Peter, I wanna give you a kiss.

01:45:29.286 --> 01:45:31.492
No, I mean a real kiss.

01:45:37.211 --> 01:45:39.204
I love you, Peter Pan.

01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.789
I love...

01:45:42.007 --> 01:45:42.837
...her.

01:45:43.050 --> 01:45:44.627
"Her," who?

01:45:45.552 --> 01:45:47.130
Mo...

01:45:47.387 --> 01:45:48.336
Moira!

01:45:48.764 --> 01:45:50.673
I love Moira...

01:45:51.683 --> 01:45:54.138
...and Jack and Maggie.

01:45:57.815 --> 01:45:59.225
Jack and Maggie...

01:46:04.946 --> 01:46:06.985
I have a plan. Tink?

01:46:08.283 --> 01:46:09.445
Come on. You gotta come.

01:46:11.118 --> 01:46:14.238
When it's all over, you'll leave and never come back again.

01:46:19.878 --> 01:46:21.787
What are you staring at, Peter?

01:46:23.047 --> 01:46:24.458
Save them.

01:46:25.091 --> 01:46:26.549
Go save them.

01:46:29.762 --> 01:46:31.007
You silly ass, go!

01:47:12.303 --> 01:47:16.596
Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate receives his first earring.

01:47:16.807 --> 01:47:21.932
It's like the first time you run someone through with your blade.

01:47:24.607 --> 01:47:25.437
Now, Jack...

01:47:25.649 --> 01:47:29.232
...I'm gonna ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.

01:47:29.486 --> 01:47:31.811
A little more. That's it.

01:47:32.072 --> 01:47:35.904
And brace yourself, lad.
Because this...

01:47:36.159 --> 01:47:38.566
...is really going to hurt.

01:47:47.546 --> 01:47:49.752
Smee, what is that?

01:48:00.766 --> 01:48:02.676
Who is that, captain?

01:48:06.647 --> 01:48:08.474
It's Peter Pan.

01:48:08.816 --> 01:48:11.272
Has it been three days?

01:48:11.861 --> 01:48:13.319
'Tis true, Peter...

01:48:13.571 --> 01:48:16.026
...time does fly.

01:48:17.783 --> 01:48:20.356
And so do you, I see.

01:48:20.785 --> 01:48:25.614
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?

01:48:29.336 --> 01:48:32.123
Hand over my son now and you and your men may go free.

01:48:32.464 --> 01:48:35.141
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?

01:48:35.167 --> 01:48:37.613
Jack, someone to see you, son.

01:48:41.347 --> 01:48:42.929
Jack, give me your hand.

01:48:42.955 --> 01:48:44.208
We're going home.

01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:46.018
I am home.

01:48:47.187 --> 01:48:48.515
Good form!

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:51.312
You see, Peter, he is my son.

01:48:51.338 --> 01:48:52.996
He loves me dearly.

01:48:53.234 --> 01:48:56.354
And I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.

01:48:56.570 --> 01:49:00.022
I've waited long to shake your hand with this.

01:49:00.282 --> 01:49:02.951
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom!

01:49:03.952 --> 01:49:06.076
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.

01:49:37.443 --> 01:49:39.187
Don't you love it, laddie?

01:49:39.213 --> 01:49:42.095
Once you've shed blood, it's hard to stop!

01:49:42.323 --> 01:49:44.648
It's a pirate's life, my lad!

01:49:44.909 --> 01:49:46.736
Jack, Jack!

01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:48.132
Don't I know him?

01:49:48.158 --> 01:49:50.478
No, you've never seen him before!

01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:55.250
You won't believe this, but I found my happy thought.

01:49:55.461 --> 01:49:58.545
It took me three days, then guess what happened?

01:49:58.756 --> 01:50:00.380
Up I went!

01:50:00.591 --> 01:50:02.797
You know what my happy thought was?

01:50:07.222 --> 01:50:08.847
It was you.

01:50:18.733 --> 01:50:22.316
That's my dad... but he hates to fly!

01:50:22.529 --> 01:50:24.604
Bangerang!

01:51:04.319 --> 01:51:05.513
Call out the militia!

01:51:05.539 --> 01:51:07.131
We'll need every last man!

01:51:15.789 --> 01:51:20.700
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!

01:51:29.635 --> 01:51:31.628
Form ranks!

01:51:31.930 --> 01:51:34.966
Form ranks!

01:51:35.850 --> 01:51:38.471
Show them the white light we're made of!

01:51:38.686 --> 01:51:41.806
Remember the fires from hell that forged you!

01:51:42.022 --> 01:51:44.015
Charge!

01:51:45.901 --> 01:51:47.478
Now!

01:51:51.906 --> 01:51:55.193
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!

01:52:18.433 --> 01:52:21.054
Smee! Do something intelligent!

01:52:23.438 --> 01:52:26.272
"Smee, Smee"!
 What about Smee?

01:52:28.859 --> 01:52:30.437
What about Smee?

01:52:31.445 --> 01:52:32.524
What about me?

01:52:40.538 --> 01:52:41.996
Thud ball!

01:52:54.092 --> 01:52:55.337
Fire!

01:53:06.521 --> 01:53:09.012
Hey, wait!

01:53:09.899 --> 01:53:11.014
Look out below!

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:21.194
Somebody help!

01:53:31.587 --> 01:53:32.236
Here we go.

01:53:32.262 --> 01:53:33.853
Take it, take it, take it!

01:53:34.548 --> 01:53:36.754
Lost Boys, down!

01:53:43.265 --> 01:53:44.973
My eyes!

01:53:45.309 --> 01:53:48.642
It's time for Smee.

01:53:58.363 --> 01:54:00.027
Where do you think you're going?

01:54:00.053 --> 01:54:01.508
Get away from that window!

01:54:12.209 --> 01:54:13.372
Hook!

01:54:17.214 --> 01:54:19.753
Rufio.

01:54:23.346 --> 01:54:25.137
The old man is mine.

01:54:25.556 --> 01:54:29.090
Jack! Save me!

01:54:29.309 --> 01:54:30.851
Maggie!

01:54:41.530 --> 01:54:43.273
Get down here!

01:54:44.157 --> 01:54:45.568
Maggie!

01:54:45.784 --> 01:54:47.361
Daddy!

01:54:49.412 --> 01:54:50.823
Wait, ain't you...

01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:52.456
Peter Pan.

01:55:02.926 --> 01:55:04.254
Daddy!

01:55:04.510 --> 01:55:06.218
Daddy?

01:55:08.806 --> 01:55:12.886
Peter Pan's my dad?

01:55:32.287 --> 01:55:34.363
I'll never lose you again.

01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:40.204
Lost Boys, we got them on the run!

01:56:15.704 --> 01:56:17.495
Here comes Pan!

01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.584
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.

01:56:26.381 --> 01:56:28.125
Hook! No!

01:56:36.057 --> 01:56:37.765
Do you know what I wish?

01:56:38.017 --> 01:56:39.048
What?

01:56:41.395 --> 01:56:43.637
I wish I had a dad...

01:56:44.356 --> 01:56:45.898
...like you.

01:56:50.363 --> 01:56:52.569
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:06.330
Are you ready for me, Peter?

01:57:07.046 --> 01:57:10.082
Come on. Humor the Hook.

01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:11.587
Dad.

01:57:18.807 --> 01:57:19.969
I wanna go home.

01:57:20.183 --> 01:57:21.837
What are you talking about?

01:57:21.863 --> 01:57:22.781
You are home.

01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:37.319
Where are you going?

01:57:51.672 --> 01:57:52.870
Lost Boys!

01:57:55.843 --> 01:57:56.673
Peter!

01:57:57.386 --> 01:57:58.634
Where are you going?

01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:00.530
Come back here and fight me!

01:58:00.722 --> 01:58:02.762
I'll find you wherever you are!

01:58:03.016 --> 01:58:05.092
Bad form, Peter! Come back.

01:58:05.310 --> 01:58:08.892
You need a mother very, very badly!

01:58:11.817 --> 01:58:13.893
Smee! Follow me!

01:58:14.194 --> 01:58:17.314
- Stairs!
- Just moving your personal...

01:58:19.407 --> 01:58:21.863
Wherever you go, wherever you are...

01:58:22.118 --> 01:58:26.447
...I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."

01:58:26.706 --> 01:58:31.249
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.

01:58:31.503 --> 01:58:33.294
Do you hear me?

01:58:43.389 --> 01:58:44.966
What do you want, old man?

01:58:49.436 --> 01:58:50.550
Just you.

01:58:50.770 --> 01:58:52.894
You've got me, James Hook.

01:58:56.735 --> 01:58:59.143
Pan "The Avenger" is back.

01:58:59.363 --> 01:59:03.277
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.

01:59:13.627 --> 01:59:15.085
It's Hook and me this time.

01:59:15.337 --> 01:59:16.087
Prepare to die.

01:59:16.113 --> 01:59:18.113
To die would be a great adventure.

01:59:18.298 --> 01:59:21.049
Death is the only adventure you have left.

01:59:32.311 --> 01:59:34.185
I remember you being a lot bigger.

01:59:34.397 --> 01:59:36.140
To a 10-year-old, I'm huge.

01:59:51.371 --> 01:59:53.079
No pain, no gain, James!

Good form, old man.

02:00:13.893 --> 02:00:16.176
You know you're not really Peter Pan.

02:00:16.202 --> 02:00:17.619
This is only a dream.

02:00:17.856 --> 02:00:22.185
You'll wake up, you'll be Peter Banning, a selfish man who drinks too much...

02:00:22.443 --> 02:00:27.152
...who's obsessed with success and runs and hides from his wife and children.

02:00:29.116 --> 02:00:30.943
I believe in you.

02:00:31.159 --> 02:00:32.154
I believe in you.

02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:33.936
I believe in you, Peter.

02:00:35.372 --> 02:00:37.412
I believe in you.

02:00:39.335 --> 02:00:40.829
You are the Pan.

02:00:41.086 --> 02:00:42.913
You're Peter Pan.

02:00:45.215 --> 02:00:46.211
I believe in you...

02:00:47.384 --> 02:00:48.842
...Peter Pan.

02:01:08.863 --> 02:01:10.321
- Bad form!
- Jack, stop!

02:01:11.615 --> 02:01:13.655
Now we end this.

02:01:22.793 --> 02:01:25.498
You blackguard!

02:01:35.639 --> 02:01:37.346
Hello! Tick-tock, tick-tock...

02:01:37.557 --> 02:01:40.131
...Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock!

02:01:40.352 --> 02:01:44.729
I think not! I think James Hook's afraid of time, ticking away!

02:01:53.573 --> 02:01:54.604
Tick...

02:02:05.668 --> 02:02:07.859
Good form, Peter.

02:02:07.885 --> 02:02:09.560
I am fallen.

02:02:12.841 --> 02:02:14.370
Give me my dignity.

02:02:14.396 --> 02:02:15.818
You took my hand.

02:02:15.844 --> 02:02:17.694
You owe me something.

02:02:30.275 --> 02:02:31.491
You killed Rufio.

02:02:31.517 --> 02:02:33.422
You kidnapped my children.

02:02:33.448 --> 02:02:34.878
You deserve to die.

02:02:35.071 --> 02:02:39.365
Strike, Peter Pan.
Strike true.

02:02:39.992 --> 02:02:44.655
Daddy, let's go home.
Please?

02:02:44.873 --> 02:02:47.790
He's just a mean old man without a mommy.

02:02:48.626 --> 02:02:50.272
Yeah, Dad, let's go.

02:02:50.298 --> 02:02:52.518
He can't hurt us anymore.

02:02:53.297 --> 02:02:54.774
Bless you, child.

02:02:54.800 --> 02:02:56.276
Good form, Jack.

02:02:56.467 --> 02:03:00.630
After all, what would the world be like...

02:03:01.847 --> 02:03:03.556
...without Captain Hook?

02:03:04.892 --> 02:03:08.343
I want you to take your ship and go.

02:03:08.687 --> 02:03:11.605
I never want to see your face in Never Land again.

02:03:19.197 --> 02:03:20.160
Peter, look out!

02:03:20.186 --> 02:03:22.472
Fools, James Hook is Never Land!

02:03:24.285 --> 02:03:27.121
Whenever children read, it will say:

02:03:27.331 --> 02:03:30.664
"Thus perished Peter Pan."

02:03:41.594 --> 02:03:43.633
What's happening?

02:04:08.078 --> 02:04:11.447
I want my Mommy!

02:04:32.268 --> 02:04:34.261
Hook's gone.

02:04:34.687 --> 02:04:37.392
Hook's gone! Hook's gone!

02:04:40.693 --> 02:04:42.769
Bangerang!

02:04:46.156 --> 02:04:46.986
No more Hook!

02:04:47.241 --> 02:04:50.444
No more Hook! No more Hook!

02:04:53.914 --> 02:04:56.156
Hurray for Pan the Man!

02:05:03.882 --> 02:05:05.958
What's wrong, Peter?

02:05:06.342 --> 02:05:07.341
I can't stay.

02:05:07.367 --> 02:05:11.363
I've done what I came to do, and now I have to go back.

02:05:15.143 --> 02:05:18.263
Tink, make my kids glow.

02:05:27.446 --> 02:05:32.156
Jack, Maggie, all you have to do is think one happy thought...

02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:34.118
...and you'll fly like me.

02:05:38.249 --> 02:05:39.447
Mommy!

02:05:40.793 --> 02:05:42.251
My dad...

02:05:43.379 --> 02:05:44.956
...Peter Pan.

02:05:49.134 --> 02:05:51.210
Tink, you know the way.

02:05:51.512 --> 02:05:53.303
I'll be just behind you.

02:06:15.493 --> 02:06:19.158
Don't leave us, Peter, and don't say goodbye.

02:06:19.455 --> 02:06:20.866
What's "goodbye"?

02:06:21.124 --> 02:06:22.322
It's going away.

02:06:22.348 --> 02:06:23.770
That's what it is.

02:06:24.001 --> 02:06:25.910
Forgetting about us all over again.

02:06:26.128 --> 02:06:27.546
You're all my Lost Boys.

02:06:27.572 --> 02:06:28.988
I'll never forget you.

02:06:29.673 --> 02:06:30.918
Never.

02:06:34.262 --> 02:06:36.254
So who do I leave in charge?

02:07:12.214 --> 02:07:15.666
I want you to take care of everyone who's smaller than you.

02:07:16.803 --> 02:07:18.961
Then who do I look after?

02:07:19.931 --> 02:07:21.508
Never Bugs.

02:07:22.808 --> 02:07:24.433
Little ones.

02:07:46.832 --> 02:07:50.117
That was a great game.

02:07:50.794 --> 02:07:52.786
<i>Thank you for believing.</i>

02:08:28.413 --> 02:08:29.872
I know her.

02:08:30.916 --> 02:08:33.537
She looks like an angel.

02:08:33.752 --> 02:08:36.159
Let's not wake her yet.

02:09:24.802 --> 02:09:28.502
My dear child, have you been up all night?

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:33.091
I see them in their beds so often in my dreams.

02:09:33.685 --> 02:09:35.891
When I wake up, they're still there.

02:10:19.062 --> 02:10:20.077
Tink?

02:10:20.103 --> 02:10:22.538
Tink? Tink?

02:10:31.741 --> 02:10:32.571
Hello.

02:10:35.745 --> 02:10:37.498
Having trouble with the misses?

02:10:37.524 --> 02:10:39.898
You will have, by the time you get home.

02:10:46.172 --> 02:10:47.002
Tink!

02:10:49.008 --> 02:10:50.464
Say it, Peter.

02:10:50.490 --> 02:10:52.568
Say it and mean it.

02:10:54.096 --> 02:10:55.887
I believe in faeries.

02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:59.225
Do you know that place between sleep and awake...

02:10:59.726 --> 02:11:01.683
...where you still remember dreaming?

02:11:04.105 --> 02:11:06.313
That's where I'll always love you...

02:11:07.318 --> 02:11:08.978
...Peter Pan.

02:11:11.822 --> 02:11:13.613
That's where I'll be waiting.

02:11:33.676 --> 02:11:35.170
Nana!

02:11:35.386 --> 02:11:36.621
Oh, give us a kiss!

02:11:36.647 --> 02:11:38.661
Come here, you drool machine!

02:11:46.396 --> 02:11:47.807
Tink?

02:12:05.623 --> 02:12:08.993
Brad! Hi! Have you been holding this long?

02:12:10.003 --> 02:12:12.094
I'm incredible! Yeah.

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:13.314
Never Land!

02:12:14.591 --> 02:12:15.970
Lost Boys.
Jim Hook.

02:12:15.996 --> 02:12:17.295
Duel to the death.

02:12:17.321 --> 02:12:19.053
I'll fill you in later.

02:12:19.262 --> 02:12:21.005
Listen, I'd love to chat...

02:12:21.264 --> 02:12:23.470
...but I gotta climb a drainpipe now.

02:12:24.100 --> 02:12:26.664
Why? Because I ran out of faerie dust.

02:12:26.690 --> 02:12:29.119
If not, I would've flown up. Why!!

02:12:35.445 --> 02:12:36.853
There were pirates..!

02:12:36.879 --> 02:12:38.554
And monsters there!

02:12:39.281 --> 02:12:40.657
Just like you said!

02:12:40.866 --> 02:12:42.241
Granny Wendy!

02:12:43.369 --> 02:12:44.317
Let me in!

02:12:45.037 --> 02:12:46.412
Please.

02:12:48.999 --> 02:12:51.372
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?

02:12:54.004 --> 02:12:57.040
What did I tell you about this window?

02:12:57.341 --> 02:12:58.716
Always keep it open!

02:13:00.552 --> 02:13:03.506
Never, ever, ever close...

02:13:23.074 --> 02:13:24.568
I have to take this.

02:13:24.784 --> 02:13:29.077
Have you ever known what it's like to feel the exhilaration of really flying?

02:13:29.329 --> 02:13:31.037
Feel this.

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:33.535
Where have you been?

02:13:33.751 --> 02:13:34.996
Fly me, Daddy, fly me!

02:13:35.211 --> 02:13:36.468
Anytime, Maggie.

02:13:36.494 --> 02:13:38.770
To infinity and back again.

02:13:39.340 --> 02:13:41.048
Hello, Peter.

02:13:41.717 --> 02:13:45.002
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?

02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:48.756
I think these belong to you.

02:14:01.236 --> 02:14:02.066
Look!

02:14:02.487 --> 02:14:03.168
See, look!

02:14:03.194 --> 02:14:05.715
I didn't lose my marbles after all!

02:14:05.949 --> 02:14:07.407
Wendy, look!
 See?

02:14:07.617 --> 02:14:10.238
I didn't lose my marbles after all!

02:14:12.079 --> 02:14:13.870
Hello, boy.

02:14:14.916 --> 02:14:16.707
Hello, Wendy lady.

02:14:17.418 --> 02:14:18.581
Give us a skwoodge.

02:14:29.721 --> 02:14:31.548
Boy, why are you crying?

02:14:32.099 --> 02:14:32.994
I don't know.

02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:35.290
A tear for every happy thought.

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:36.391
One for me?

02:14:37.313 --> 02:14:39.021
- One for me?
- One for me?

02:14:39.273 --> 02:14:41.431
And one for me!

02:14:56.163 --> 02:14:58.121
Seize the day!

02:15:01.586 --> 02:15:04.706
So your adventures are over.

02:15:04.964 --> 02:15:06.375
Oh, no.

02:15:06.632 --> 02:15:08.126
To live...

02:15:08.384 --> 02:15:11.135
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
