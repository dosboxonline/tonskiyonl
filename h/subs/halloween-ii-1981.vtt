WEBVTT

00:51.300 --> 00:52.760
I want you to listen to me.

00:52.760 --> 00:54.554
I want you to
go out of the house

00:54.554 --> 00:57.056
and down the street to
the MacKenzies' house?

00:57.265 --> 00:58.891
I want you to
knock on their door,

00:58.891 --> 01:00.601
I want you to tell them
to call the police

01:00.601 --> 01:03.437
and send them over here.
All right?

01:03.437 --> 01:05.147
- What
- Now do as I say!

01:05.147 --> 01:06.649
Yeah.

01:07.316 --> 01:08.442
Go!

01:30.464 --> 01:31.757
Come on! Get help!

01:31.966 --> 01:32.925
Come on!

01:33.134 --> 01:35.970
Come on! Come on!

02:48.918 --> 02:50.795
Was that the boogie man?

02:56.258 --> 02:58.427
As a matter of fact, it was.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.652
What's going on out here?

03:56.652 --> 03:57.862
Call the police.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.156
- Tell the sheriff I shot him.
- Who?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.283
Tell him he's still
on the loose!

04:02.283 --> 04:05.911
Is this some kind of joke? I've been
trick or treated to death tonight.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.330
You don't know what death is.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.501
Trick or treat!

08:04.441 --> 08:07.152
- I shot him six times!
- What?

08:07.152 --> 08:11.615
I said I shot him six times!
I shot him in the heart and...

08:11.615 --> 08:13.075
He can't have gotten
very far. Come on.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.119
- I shot him six times.
- Yeah, I know.

08:15.285 --> 08:19.540
This guy, this man...
He's not human!

08:42.770 --> 08:44.857
Harold, you want mayonnaise
on your sandwich?

08:51.155 --> 08:52.281
How about mustard?

08:54.283 --> 08:55.284
- Oh, Harold...
- Up next...

08:55.451 --> 08:58.120
<i>a morsel of mind-melting
madness, Night of the Living Dead.</i>

08:58.287 --> 09:00.205
Are you asleep again?

09:10.758 --> 09:13.260
<i>This is a WWAR special bulletin.</i>

09:13.802 --> 09:16.472
<i>Police in Haddonfield have
just made the grisly discovery</i>

09:16.472 --> 09:19.058
<i>of three bodies in the upstairs
bedrooms of this house.</i>

09:19.641 --> 09:22.811
<i>It appears that the murders took
place sometime early this evening.</i>

09:23.145 --> 09:26.690
<i>Authorities have confirmed that all
three of the victims are teenagers,</i>

09:26.690 --> 09:30.778
<i>two girls and a boy. Police
are searching the entire area</i>

09:30.778 --> 09:32.946
for a mental patient
who escaped last night

09:32.946 --> 09:35.157
from the Smith's Grove-Warren
County Sanitarium.

09:35.657 --> 09:38.077
He is now believed to be
at large in Haddonfield.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.037
<i>This is Robert Mundy live.</i>

09:45.417 --> 09:48.003
They're coming
to get you, Barbara!

09:49.171 --> 09:51.131
<i>Stop it!
You're ignorant!</i>

09:51.423 --> 09:53.717
<i>They're coming for you, Barbara!</i>

09:54.218 --> 09:56.804
<i>Stop It!
You're acting like a child!</i>

09:57.096 --> 09:58.972
<i>They're coming for you!</i>

09:59.223 --> 10:01.767
<i>Look, there comes
one of them now!</i>

10:01.767 --> 10:02.810
<i>He'll hear you!</i>

10:03.018 --> 10:04.186
<i>Here he comes now!</i>

10:04.186 --> 10:05.813
<i>I'm getting out of here!</i>

10:27.251 --> 10:28.669
Mrs. EIrod?

10:29.753 --> 10:30.963
Mr. Elrod?

10:33.632 --> 10:35.092
Are you okay?

10:48.564 --> 10:52.025
Hi. There was someone
screaming next door.

10:52.568 --> 10:54.194
Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. EIrod.

10:55.195 --> 10:57.447
His wife's always
picking on him.

10:57.447 --> 11:00.200
He probably got angry and
decided to start beating her.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.830
Oh, big deal.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.874
<i>Are your folks home?</i>

11:06.874 --> 11:08.709
They are gone.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.295
My dad had to take my Aunt
Ruby to Hardin County

11:11.295 --> 11:13.755
and my mother
decided to go along.

11:13.755 --> 11:15.424
<i>Didn't you hear?</i>

11:15.424 --> 11:16.758
Hear about what?

11:16.758 --> 11:20.095
Some <i>girl got killed in Haddonfield.
It's on the radio.</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:22.222
Hold on.

11:24.057 --> 11:26.602
...so the police
have cordoned off the entire area.

11:26.894 --> 11:30.147
To repeat: Three teenagers have
been found murdered in a house

11:30.147 --> 11:31.940
in the northwest section
of Haddonfield.

11:32.232 --> 11:34.276
The names of the teenagers
have not been released.

11:34.276 --> 11:35.444
I can't believe it.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.738
<i>I know. You know,
we probably knew her.</i>

11:37.738 --> 11:38.739
Where did it happen?

11:38.947 --> 11:39.948
<i>Down on Orange Grove.</i>

11:41.158 --> 11:42.618
That's right down the street.

11:42.618 --> 11:43.994
<i>I know.</i>

11:44.286 --> 11:45.913
<i>Police confirmed the girl was
rescued as she fought...</i>

11:45.913 --> 11:48.415
Sally, I can hear
the sirens coming.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.125
<i>They said the guy got away.</i>

11:50.542 --> 11:52.461
- Do they know who It was?
<i>- No.</i>

11:53.712 --> 11:54.630
Oh, God.

11:55.839 --> 11:57.299
<i>Allco?</i>

11:57.841 --> 12:00.302
<i>Alice? What's wrong?</i>

12:01.678 --> 12:02.804
<i>Alice?</i>

12:03.972 --> 12:05.349
Who is it?

12:05.349 --> 12:07.100
<i>Alice? Where are you?</i>

12:08.477 --> 12:09.770
Who is it?

12:09.770 --> 12:12.272
<i>Gary Hunt of the Haddonfield
Police Department says he believes</i>

12:12.272 --> 12:15.359
<i>the suspect will be apprehended
within a matter of hours.</i>

12:15.943 --> 12:18.487
<i>Neighbors said they heard screams
during the early evening</i>

12:18.487 --> 12:20.530
<i>but attributed the noise
to the usual Halloween...</i>

12:44.846 --> 12:46.682
I'm asking, what's going on?
He said he shot somebody.

12:46.974 --> 12:48.642
Inside, guys, will you?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.894
<i>So he shot somebody.</i>

13:20.841 --> 13:22.801
<i>All right, folks, give them
room, will you, please?</i>

13:48.702 --> 13:50.203
Laurie, can you hear me?

13:50.412 --> 13:51.538
Don't let them put me to sleep.

13:51.705 --> 13:52.873
It's all right, take it easy.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.082
We're gonna go to
the clinic, all right?

13:54.082 --> 13:55.208
Don't let them put me to sleep.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.543
It's okay.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.471
Hey, you know this chick?

14:09.056 --> 14:10.182
Yeah, her name's Laurie Strode.

14:12.517 --> 14:14.519
Her old man Strode Realty?

14:14.686 --> 14:16.563
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.833
Okay, just get out easy.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.045
It's gonna be okay.
Walk real slow, okay?

14:40.796 --> 14:43.423
Are you all right?
You all right, hon?

14:45.634 --> 14:47.302
Oh, God! Oh!

14:47.552 --> 14:51.056
Here, just put it up there real gently.
You okay? Let's go.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.474
Just walk real slow. Come on.

15:52.033 --> 15:54.035
Fill out this form. Someone
will be with you in a moment.

15:54.035 --> 15:55.787
Well, we should see
a doctor right away.

15:55.787 --> 15:58.373
He's with a patient. Would
you please wait in Room A?

15:58.373 --> 16:00.584
Oh, come on, honey. Thank you.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.337
<i>Where's Dr. Miner?</i>

16:04.337 --> 16:05.589
He's been at the Country Club.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.382
I think he's drunk. Oh, great.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.092
What have you got?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.510
Stab wound left anterior chest.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.346
Possibly penetrating. Multiple contusions.
It's Laurie Strode.

16:13.346 --> 16:14.389
Yeah, yeah, come on, let's go.

16:14.556 --> 16:15.599
Possibly fractured right ankle.

16:16.391 --> 16:17.684
Janet, get me some more coffee.

16:17.851 --> 16:19.102
Get that out of here.

16:22.647 --> 16:25.025
Oh, Laurie, hi, there!

16:26.026 --> 16:28.445
Well, let's see
what we have here.

16:28.945 --> 16:32.032
Ah, yes. You've lost
a lot of blood.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.201
We'll need to type it.

16:35.410 --> 16:36.536
Yeah.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.041
<i>When was the last time
you had a tetanus shot?</i>

16:42.250 --> 16:43.543
I don't know.

16:49.758 --> 16:52.761
Get me some 3-0 nylon on a...

16:52.761 --> 16:54.054
Cutting needle? Yes.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.096
Right away.

16:55.096 --> 16:56.223
We're going to
have to put her out.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.642
No! No, don't put me to sleep!

16:58.975 --> 17:01.228
Okay, relax. Relax,
we're not gonna hurt you.

17:01.228 --> 17:02.979
No! No!

17:04.731 --> 17:06.273
Please, don't put me to sleep.

17:08.777 --> 17:09.819
Take it easy.

17:14.532 --> 17:16.326
<i>Try to relax, Laurie.</i>

17:18.787 --> 17:21.748
<i>Dr. Mixter will have you
stitched up in no time.</i>

17:21.957 --> 17:23.750
<i>Take it easy, Laurie.</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:27.837
Circle the block again.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.715
How long now?

17:30.715 --> 17:32.634
It's about 30 minutes.
Put the light down there.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.760
There, by those trees.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.471
Well, there's nothing.

17:36.471 --> 17:38.056
Well, keep going!

17:38.723 --> 17:40.976
You know, Doctor,
I'm just about there.

17:40.976 --> 17:42.060
What?

17:42.269 --> 17:44.938
The point where I stop
taking orders from you.

17:45.522 --> 17:48.108
All right, Sheriff,
whatever you want.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.944
The primary concern
is that we stop him!

17:51.278 --> 17:52.696
You let him out.

17:52.696 --> 17:55.365
I didn't.
His own goddamn doctor!

17:55.365 --> 17:57.117
I didn't let him out.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.160
<i>Chief Brackett, come in, please.</i>

17:59.160 --> 18:00.787
<i>Chief Brackett, come in, please.</i>

18:01.538 --> 18:02.622
Who is it?

18:02.831 --> 18:03.915
<i>Chief, this is...</i>

18:04.249 --> 18:05.625
Say again, what is it?

18:05.625 --> 18:06.751
<i>This is Ramsey.</i>

18:06.918 --> 18:08.128
Where are you?

18:08.128 --> 18:11.047
<i>I'm out by the bakery moving
north on the Scottsville Road.</i>

18:11.298 --> 18:12.966
Get the hell back into town.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.302
Go up 17th Street
and meet me by the Bypass.

18:15.844 --> 18:17.679
<i>10-4, Ramsey clear.</i>

18:18.138 --> 18:20.307
Will you put that thing away?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.436
You couldn't have
shot him six times.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.146
You think I'm lying, Sheriff?

18:26.146 --> 18:29.149
I think you missed him.
No man could take six slugs.

18:29.357 --> 18:31.151
I'm telling you,
this isn't a man!

18:32.444 --> 18:33.653
Look out, slow down!

18:33.820 --> 18:35.822
Over there! Look, look, look!
Why?

18:39.284 --> 18:41.202
Is that him? I don't know.

18:43.705 --> 18:47.000
Get back! Run! Go on, run!
Dr. Loomis!

18:47.375 --> 18:49.753
Get back! Get back, you kids!

18:50.128 --> 18:52.172
- Run! Stop! Get out...
- Dr. Loomis!

18:52.380 --> 18:53.923
- Loomis!

18:54.132 --> 18:55.216
Loomis!

18:55.216 --> 18:56.134
Stop!

18:57.886 --> 18:59.179
Stop!

18:59.471 --> 19:00.847
Don't shoot!

19:01.806 --> 19:03.433
Stop! Don't...

19:15.153 --> 19:16.655
Get him. Sheriff Brackett.

19:18.782 --> 19:21.368
He came out of nowhere.
I couldn't stop.

19:21.826 --> 19:22.827
Is it him?

19:23.662 --> 19:25.080
I don't know.

19:27.832 --> 19:28.958
Is it him or not?

19:36.925 --> 19:39.177
Leigh,

19:39.386 --> 19:41.012
- Leigh, they found three bodies.
- Where?

19:41.596 --> 19:43.890
Across the street
from the Doyle house.

19:43.890 --> 19:45.225
Three kids.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.686
Leigh, one of them was Annie!

19:47.977 --> 19:49.062
What?

19:59.823 --> 20:01.032
Does it hurt a lot?

20:02.450 --> 20:03.618
What?

20:04.786 --> 20:07.122
Oh, sweetie, I can't understand you!
Look, it'll be okay.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.374
We'll play some
games tonight, and...

20:09.374 --> 20:11.543
Repeating for those of you
who just tuned in,

20:11.543 --> 20:13.169
three people are dead tonight

20:13.712 --> 20:16.381
<i>as the result of an attack
by an escaped mental patient.</i>

20:17.132 --> 20:19.426
<i>I understand we're going to
stay on the air now.</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:21.886
<i>Repeating for those of you
who just tuned in.</i>

20:22.595 --> 20:24.973
<i>Three people are dead
tonight as the result</i>

20:24.973 --> 20:27.142
<i>of an attack by
an escaped mental patient.</i>

20:28.143 --> 20:31.104
<i>Any further details will be
forthcoming as soon as we get them.</i>

20:32.313 --> 20:35.191
<i>This is Robert Mundy
reporting to you live.</i>

21:07.182 --> 21:08.183
Hi.

21:09.517 --> 21:10.477
Hi.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.355
Jimmy, leave her alone.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.150
Well, how are you feeling?

21:18.067 --> 21:19.152
Sore.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.655
What happened?

21:22.906 --> 21:24.407
Cracked a bone.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.075
You're lucky it wasn't a break.

21:26.326 --> 21:29.829
<i>Dr. Mixter felt that he should wait
until tomorrow before he put a cast on.</i>

21:30.747 --> 21:32.457
You have to get some rest.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.709
Come on, Jimmy.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.637
Can I get you something
to drink or anything?

21:47.305 --> 21:48.348
How about a Coke?

21:49.349 --> 21:51.392
Okay. Thanks.

21:52.227 --> 21:53.311
Okay.

21:53.311 --> 21:55.522
Come on, Jimmy, we gotta roll.
Another call come in.

21:55.522 --> 21:56.856
Okay. Okay. Come on.

21:56.856 --> 21:58.107
Get you that Coke later.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.026
Out!

22:03.071 --> 22:04.781
Moments ago,
police reported that

22:04.781 --> 22:06.908
Michael Myers,
formerly of Haddonfield,

22:07.116 --> 22:09.953
who fled the Smith's Grove-Warren
County Sanitarium last night,

22:09.953 --> 22:11.538
was believed to
have burned to death.

22:12.121 --> 22:13.748
Meanwhile,
three bodies were discovered

22:13.748 --> 22:16.543
in the upstairs bedroom of the
house directly behind me.

22:16.543 --> 22:19.546
Identification of the victims is being
withheld pending notification...

22:19.754 --> 22:22.173
Forget that. Forget that. I
wanna concentrate on the house.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.802
Talk to some kids.
See if anybody saw anything.

22:26.094 --> 22:28.388
All right, you need their parents'
permission to use a statement.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.890
If you can't find the parents,
get a statement anyway.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.435
Not now.

22:40.191 --> 22:41.484
Just a minute, fellas.

23:13.016 --> 23:15.727
I have to

23:16.394 --> 23:19.439
go and tell my wife
before somebody else does.

23:22.817 --> 23:24.527
Go on home, Leigh.

23:24.527 --> 23:26.321
Go on home. I'll take
care of everything.

23:27.322 --> 23:28.656
Damn you!

23:28.656 --> 23:30.033
- I'm sorry.
- What have you done?

23:30.033 --> 23:31.326
I haven't done anything.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.911
You let him out!

23:32.911 --> 23:36.497
I didn't let him out, I gave
orders for him to be restrained.

23:37.332 --> 23:39.792
Now is there anything else
that we can do for you'?

23:40.335 --> 23:44.130
If that wasn't Michael Myers
burning up in that car,

23:44.339 --> 23:46.758
then a lot of other kids are
gonna be slaughtered tonight.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.843
He's dead! I saw him!

23:48.843 --> 23:49.886
You saw a man in a mask.

23:50.053 --> 23:51.179
It was him.

23:51.179 --> 23:53.181
I wanna believe you,
but I got to be sure.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.350
I can't stop until
I'm certain that he's dead.

23:55.850 --> 23:58.186
You're talking about him like
he's some kind of animal.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.771
He was my...
Would you keep it back?

23:59.771 --> 24:02.023
He was my patient for 15 years.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.858
He became
an obsession with me until

24:03.858 --> 24:05.944
I realized that there
was nothing within him,

24:05.944 --> 24:10.615
neither conscience nor reason,
that was even remotely human.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.202
An hour ago I stood up
and fired six shots into him.

24:14.202 --> 24:16.037
He just got up and walked away.

24:16.037 --> 24:20.249
I am talking about the real possibility
that he is still out there!

24:21.876 --> 24:23.670
Where'd they take the body?

24:23.670 --> 24:24.963
Coroner's office.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.340
Get a dentist to meet me
there in half an hour.

24:38.226 --> 24:40.937
<i>In spite of the fact
that the man who rescued Laurie Strode</i>

24:40.937 --> 24:44.107
<i>claims to have shot him
six times at close range,</i>

24:44.273 --> 24:46.067
<i>Haddonfield police
have no explanation</i>

24:46.234 --> 24:48.152
<i>for the suspect's disappearance,</i>

24:48.152 --> 24:49.529
<i>but say they're
confident he will</i>

24:49.737 --> 24:51.614
<i>be captured soon.
Paramedics are now</i>

24:51.823 --> 24:52.865
<i>removing the last of the three bodies
- I cannot believe it.</i>

24:53.074 --> 24:54.867
Pin the Tail on the Donkey
and bobbing for apples.

24:54.867 --> 24:57.078
Actually bobbing
in water, no less.

24:57.078 --> 24:58.997
Well, you gotta use water.
See, if you don't use water...

24:58.997 --> 25:01.124
I'm never going to another
Halloween party as long as I live,

25:01.124 --> 25:03.376
especially not at
Stevie Mathis' house.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.086
And, of course,
now I'm gonna be late.

25:05.086 --> 25:07.088
Well, you gotta
drive me home first.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.339
Oh, Darcy, I don't have time.

25:08.548 --> 25:09.841
Well, you've got to.

25:10.049 --> 25:12.885
Oh, can't you ask Eddie Lee?

25:13.094 --> 25:14.679
He's in Russellville.

25:14.887 --> 25:15.680
Oh.

25:15.888 --> 25:17.140
It's five minutes to your house,

25:17.140 --> 25:18.766
another five minutes
back to the hospital.

25:18.766 --> 25:20.727
Mrs. Alves is gonna kill me.

25:21.686 --> 25:23.229
You promised me.

25:25.565 --> 25:26.983
I know I did.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.550
There is one survivor.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.010
Seventeen-year-old Laurie Strode

25:54.177 --> 25:55.762
was found directly
across the street

25:55.762 --> 25:57.764
from the home where
the murders took place.

25:57.930 --> 25:59.640
The teenager was
taken across town

25:59.640 --> 26:01.267
to Haddonfield Memorial Clinic.

27:23.307 --> 27:25.017
In the aftermath
of the killings,

27:25.017 --> 27:27.395
the streets
between Chestnut and 10th

27:27.395 --> 27:29.689
are jammed with people and cars.

27:30.898 --> 27:34.902
Repeating that these streets
are Chestnut and 10th.

27:34.902 --> 27:37.071
They're just jammed
with both people and cars.

27:37.071 --> 27:39.657
Boy, I sure could
go for a pizza now.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.536
A nice big one with sausage,
onions, peppers.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.038
But no mushrooms.
I hate mushrooms.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.792
<i>The names of the young
victims have not yet been released,</i>

27:49.792 --> 27:52.503
<i>but the people in the crowd have
recognized them as neighborhood teenagers.</i>

27:52.503 --> 27:54.547
Looks like a goddamn homecoming.

27:59.302 --> 28:02.889
<i>Now back to Dementia!</i>

28:32.293 --> 28:33.544
Thanks, Mr. Garrett.

28:40.301 --> 28:41.761
Julie saw him, you know.

28:43.387 --> 28:44.430
Who?

28:44.639 --> 28:46.098
Michael Myers.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.475
Come on.

28:47.475 --> 28:49.769
I swear! Yesterday, when
she was coming to work!

28:50.102 --> 28:51.604
Where did she see him?

28:52.605 --> 28:54.607
You know the Shop n Bag
out by the mall?

28:55.358 --> 28:57.026
Well, she stopped at a light

28:57.026 --> 28:58.486
and saw him
walking in that field

28:58.486 --> 28:59.946
behind the Lost River drive-in.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.324
Julie said he was so creepy.

29:03.324 --> 29:05.117
Julie's full of shit!

29:05.451 --> 29:07.078
He didn't escape
until last night.

29:09.830 --> 29:11.791
Well, you don't
have to swear, Budd.

29:11.791 --> 29:14.001
Wall, she's
a goddamn moron, anyway.

29:14.001 --> 29:16.504
Every other word you say is either
"hell" or "shit" or "damn"!

29:18.381 --> 29:19.966
I'm sorry.

29:19.966 --> 29:21.467
I guess I just
fuck up all the time.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.861
Hi. You're late.

29:40.861 --> 29:43.656
Yeah, I know.
I've gotta get on the ward.

29:44.365 --> 29:45.658
Hi, Jimmy.

29:45.866 --> 29:47.326
Oh, hi, Karen.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.626
See you later.

29:55.626 --> 29:56.752
Right.

30:01.048 --> 30:02.466
Amazing grace

30:03.217 --> 30:05.136
Come sit on my face

30:06.554 --> 30:08.139
Don't make me cry

30:08.597 --> 30:10.182
I need your pie...

30:10.683 --> 30:12.685
Look, why don't you
just shut up, all right?

30:13.394 --> 30:14.729
What are you
all revved up about?

30:15.021 --> 30:16.230
Look, it could have
been Ziggy, you know.

30:16.230 --> 30:18.441
And it could have been your brother
Mark we pulled out of there.

30:18.733 --> 30:20.401
All right, so what
do you want me to do?

30:21.485 --> 30:24.530
Look, Jimmy, rule number one, never
get involved with a patient.

30:25.698 --> 30:27.867
Nurses, that's another story,

30:28.576 --> 30:30.578
but patients, it's no good.
It never works out.

30:32.496 --> 30:34.749
Where you going, college boy?

30:34.749 --> 30:36.625
I'm telling you,
listen to old Budd.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.073
You were late again tonight.

31:50.991 --> 31:52.576
Just 15 minutes.

31:52.743 --> 31:54.120
That could be
the difference between

31:54.120 --> 31:55.663
life and death for
one of those kids.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.417
You're right, I'm sorry, Mrs.
Alves. It's just that I...

31:59.417 --> 32:01.001
I don't wanna hear any excuses.

32:01.001 --> 32:03.462
You're a good nurse, Karen,
I'd hate to lose you,

32:03.712 --> 32:05.673
but you've got to
learn to be on time.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.883
Now let's go over this list.

32:07.883 --> 32:09.677
It'll be fine, really,
I promise. I'm very sorry.

32:12.471 --> 32:15.433
Carr, Mrs. Carr,
9:30 tomorrow morning.

32:15.433 --> 32:18.477
God, they should have... They should
have handled him more carefully.

32:19.603 --> 32:20.646
Who?

32:22.148 --> 32:23.607
Michael Myers.

32:25.818 --> 32:27.278
Michael Myers?

32:28.446 --> 32:30.739
Yeah, he was the guy
that was after you.

32:34.535 --> 32:36.495
You mean, the Myers house?

32:39.457 --> 32:41.292
That little kid who
killed his sister?

32:41.292 --> 32:42.334
Yeah.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.048
But he's in
a hospital somewhere.

32:48.048 --> 32:49.884
He escaped last night.

32:50.050 --> 32:51.719
How do you know?

32:51.719 --> 32:55.848
It's all over the radio. Television, too.
It's on right now.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.564
Why me?

33:05.024 --> 33:06.650
I mean, why me?

33:09.570 --> 33:12.239
Time's up, Jimmy. Let's go.

33:13.157 --> 33:14.450
Okay, okay.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.748
- I'll be back
- No, you won't!

33:20.748 --> 33:22.833
Visiting hours
are definitely over!

33:26.629 --> 33:29.131
Men, you can't live with them,
you can't live without them.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.301
How's that shoulder feel?

33:33.177 --> 33:34.178
Better.

33:34.345 --> 33:35.387
Good.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.265
We've been trying to get
a hold of your parents.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.101
Dr. Mixter told me they were
at the same party he was,

33:41.268 --> 33:43.229
but they're not there now
and they're not at home.

33:43.687 --> 33:45.356
Do you have any idea
where else they might be?

33:47.191 --> 33:48.192
No.

33:49.151 --> 33:51.237
I'll just keep trying then.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.498
Oh, this is just...

34:04.333 --> 34:05.376
Janet?

34:08.963 --> 34:10.089
Yes, Mrs. Alves?

34:10.089 --> 34:12.382
Go tell Mr. Garrett we're
having trouble with the phones.

34:12.382 --> 34:13.717
Right now.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.428
But he's at the other
end of the hall. Janet.

34:17.596 --> 34:19.139
Yes, Mrs. Alves.

34:21.850 --> 34:23.101
What's wrong with the phones?

34:25.437 --> 34:27.481
Nothing for you to worry about.

34:27.982 --> 34:29.692
Just get some rest right now.

34:30.067 --> 34:32.695
I'll let you know as soon as
we get ahold of your parents.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.225
I'm gonna go check the pole.

35:03.225 --> 35:04.435
You wait here and I'll call you.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.853
I have to get back on the floor.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.563
It'll take me five minutes.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.481
But I don't even know
how to use this thing.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.872
I think somebody
broke into the storeroom.

38:12.206 --> 38:13.499
The lock was off.

38:18.295 --> 38:21.131
Mr. Garrett? I can't hear you.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.260
One of you had better drive down

38:25.260 --> 38:26.678
to the sheriff's
station right away.

38:32.935 --> 38:35.062
Mr. Garrett,
how do you work this thing?

38:35.562 --> 38:36.688
Janet?

39:04.716 --> 39:05.759
Mr. Garrett?

40:05.527 --> 40:06.945
Mr. Garrett?

40:10.198 --> 40:12.618
Mr. Garrett, I gotta
get back on the floor!

40:16.330 --> 40:17.706
Hello?

40:33.805 --> 40:34.806
It's difficult,

40:35.349 --> 40:38.518
even the gums are charred,
but look here.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.148
See here? No fillings.

40:43.774 --> 40:46.610
He's young, maybe 17, maybe 18.

40:47.361 --> 40:48.779
Michael Myers is 21.

40:49.780 --> 40:52.699
Positive I.D. means we check
X-rays and dental records.

40:53.116 --> 40:54.159
That'll take hours.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.161
No other way to
know for sure. I'm sorry.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.663
We haven't got hours.

40:57.663 --> 40:59.206
Listen to me.
We've got to assume

40:59.206 --> 41:00.999
that Michael Myers
is still alive.

41:06.171 --> 41:07.547
Everybody goes back out.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.216
But we just closed it up.

41:09.216 --> 41:12.010
I want a sweep from Chestnut
South to the Bypass.

41:12.344 --> 41:16.598
I want every street,
every house, every backyard...

41:17.933 --> 41:19.726
Okay. You got it.

41:25.148 --> 41:26.441
Thank you.

41:35.617 --> 41:38.245
All right, that's enough!
That's enough!

41:38.245 --> 41:40.247
Come on, get out of here,
you guys. Go home.

41:40.539 --> 41:42.874
You guys get out of here. Go on.

41:51.550 --> 41:53.427
This is Hunt.
Send another vehicle.

41:53.427 --> 41:55.429
The old Myers house,
45 Lampkin Lane.

41:55.595 --> 41:59.975
The tribe. One of their number
was butchered. This is the wake.

42:06.732 --> 42:08.400
Heightens my sense of security.

42:22.539 --> 42:24.458
All right, knock it off!

42:25.375 --> 42:27.461
Come on, folks, go home!

42:27.461 --> 42:28.712
Somebody get rid of it!

42:28.712 --> 42:29.796
Knock it off!

42:33.425 --> 42:37.179
Empty. Plus we covered the whole
east end of town. Nothing.

42:37.512 --> 42:38.680
Check it again.

42:38.680 --> 42:40.265
He just isn't there!

42:40.265 --> 42:41.767
Check it again!

42:43.685 --> 42:44.770
You know,

42:45.312 --> 42:47.606
Haddonfield was a pretty
quiet town before tonight.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.734
The only gunshots you ever heard

42:51.193 --> 42:53.445
were to start the track meet
at the local high school.

42:54.237 --> 42:59.159
Yet one night in 1963, Michael
Myers did murder his sister

42:59.159 --> 43:02.037
in that upstairs bedroom
with a large butcher knife.

43:03.288 --> 43:04.456
I remember.

43:04.623 --> 43:05.874
On Halloween.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.250
I was 16 years old.

43:08.001 --> 43:09.961
It's his anniversary, Mr. Hunt.

43:11.421 --> 43:12.839
He came back.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.966
After 15 years?

43:15.342 --> 43:17.969
He waited with
extraordinary patience.

43:19.346 --> 43:23.058
There was a force
inside him biding its time.

43:24.351 --> 43:28.105
The staff grew accustomed
to his immobility and silence.

43:29.231 --> 43:31.525
In many ways,
he was the ideal patient.

43:31.525 --> 43:35.570
He didn't talk, he didn't
cry, he didn't even move.

43:36.238 --> 43:37.489
He just waited.

43:38.615 --> 43:43.078
The staff was unprepared.
They didn't know what he was.

43:44.037 --> 43:45.497
Did you know?

43:46.331 --> 43:47.707
Yeah, I knew.

43:47.707 --> 43:50.168
Excuse me. Mr. Hunt?

43:51.086 --> 43:52.212
Yeah, what is it, Craig?

43:52.212 --> 43:53.380
Yeah, I'm worried
about Bennett Tramer.

43:53.380 --> 43:54.506
He isn't home yet.

43:54.506 --> 43:55.882
Yeah, and he left
the party at 10:00.

43:55.882 --> 43:58.468
It's only a little
after 11:00, boys.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.387
He was real drunk.

44:00.387 --> 44:01.596
How old is he?

44:01.596 --> 44:02.931
Seventeen.

44:02.931 --> 44:05.016
He had this stupid mask on.

44:05.433 --> 44:07.018
All right, boys.

44:07.519 --> 44:09.688
Seventeen? And wearing a mask.

44:11.565 --> 44:14.234
Oh, God! Maybe we should
check his dental records.

44:16.153 --> 44:18.864
Old Reservoir Road. They had a
break-in at the elementary school.

44:18.864 --> 44:20.365
They're pretty sure it's him.
Come on.

45:19.007 --> 45:20.175
Stop!

45:20.175 --> 45:21.426
OW! Shit!

45:22.510 --> 45:24.429
Shit! Oh, you idiot!

45:25.388 --> 45:26.556
You could've broken it.

45:27.599 --> 45:29.017
I wish I had!

45:31.311 --> 45:33.813
I also could have
used these on you!

45:35.565 --> 45:36.983
What an asshole!

45:36.983 --> 45:38.151
Happy Halloween!

45:40.028 --> 45:44.616
Budd, you are the biggest
jerk I've ever met!

45:48.578 --> 45:50.247
But you love me.

45:51.039 --> 45:52.290
Yeah,

45:53.291 --> 45:54.626
and I'm an idiot.

46:03.677 --> 46:06.096
Let's go down to
the therapy room.

46:07.389 --> 46:09.849
Budd's finger needs
a little bit of therapy.

46:11.059 --> 46:12.477
I can't leave the kids right now.

46:13.186 --> 46:16.731
But every/body's all weirded out tonight.
All this Michael Myers crap.

46:18.108 --> 46:19.609
I just...

46:22.195 --> 46:23.655
I just want...

46:42.257 --> 46:44.592
The therapy room
is three doors down.

46:49.139 --> 46:50.682
I suppose if we
left the door open,

46:50.849 --> 46:52.350
we could hear if
somebody was coming,

46:52.517 --> 46:54.602
or if one of
the kids started to cry.

46:55.687 --> 46:58.231
No, I've gotta
check it out first.

46:59.065 --> 47:00.608
Fifteen minutes.

47:02.652 --> 47:04.404
If everything's okay.

47:05.655 --> 47:07.365
You're wasting time.

47:18.752 --> 47:21.004
<i>Why won't you tell me?</i>

47:21.212 --> 47:23.089
<i>Why won't you ever
tell me anything?</i>

47:24.299 --> 47:27.552
I told you, I'm not your mother.

49:02.689 --> 49:03.606
Ow!

49:03.815 --> 49:04.983
It's hot.

49:30.341 --> 49:31.259
Whew!

49:32.635 --> 49:34.888
It's hot in here.

49:36.181 --> 49:37.390
It's just me.

49:51.905 --> 49:53.490
I'm not kidding.

49:54.908 --> 49:57.035
It's too hot in here now, Budd.

49:57.035 --> 49:59.037
Why don't you go check it?

50:00.538 --> 50:02.040
It's cold out there.

50:03.416 --> 50:05.335
It can get cold in here.

50:08.588 --> 50:09.756
Gotcha.

51:25.206 --> 51:28.293
Forget it, Budd.
I have to go back to work.

51:35.633 --> 51:38.136
Do you wanna go
for breakfast later?

51:47.520 --> 51:48.730
I'm sorry.

51:51.733 --> 51:54.277
I just have to get back,
that's all.

51:55.987 --> 51:57.322
Now, Budd, don't be that way.

51:58.406 --> 51:59.699
No!

52:03.328 --> 52:04.412
Oh, God!

52:36.903 --> 52:38.404
He got in here.

52:39.781 --> 52:41.741
And look over here.

52:50.208 --> 52:51.376
And here.

53:00.093 --> 53:01.844
Sister.

53:03.221 --> 53:04.472
Is that it?

53:04.639 --> 53:05.640
No.

53:06.349 --> 53:07.392
Here.

53:14.315 --> 53:15.566
What's this?

53:15.775 --> 53:17.068
It's gibberish.

53:17.485 --> 53:20.196
No. It's a Celtic word.

53:23.616 --> 53:25.910
It means,
"The Lord of the Dead.â€œ

53:26.411 --> 53:27.870
"The end of summer."

53:29.247 --> 53:31.999
The festival of Samhain,

53:32.959 --> 53:34.419
October 31st.

53:36.504 --> 53:37.588
Dr. Loomis?

53:37.797 --> 53:38.923
Yes?

53:39.966 --> 53:41.509
I have to talk to you.

53:43.803 --> 53:45.847
Oh, I didn't recognize you.

53:46.556 --> 53:47.640
What are you doing here?

53:48.725 --> 53:50.017
Privately.

54:00.653 --> 54:01.821
Thanks.

54:03.072 --> 54:06.492
Dr. Loomis, you've been
ordered back to Smiths-Grove.

54:07.326 --> 54:09.829
Ordered? They can't order me.

54:09.829 --> 54:12.915
No, no, but the Governor can.

54:13.249 --> 54:15.501
He spoke to Dr. Rogers
personally a few hours ago.

54:15.501 --> 54:18.337
The Governor? Well, well.

54:18.671 --> 54:21.632
Dr. Loomis, this thing
is all over the state.

54:22.175 --> 54:25.428
Your patient escapes once,
murders three teenagers,

54:25.428 --> 54:27.805
you shoot him with a gun,
he escapes again!

54:27.805 --> 54:30.433
Someone should have
listened to me earlier.

54:30.433 --> 54:32.059
I know, I'm sorry.

54:33.311 --> 54:35.521
Dr. Rogers is just afraid
this could jeopardize

54:35.521 --> 54:37.482
our whole
rehabilitation program.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.692
He doesn't want anyone from
the Mental Health Department

54:39.692 --> 54:41.027
anywhere near Haddonfield.

54:41.027 --> 54:43.488
Why did he send you
down here then?

54:44.822 --> 54:47.533
In case you'd already
found him alive.

54:47.533 --> 54:49.160
Tell Dr. Rogers...

54:49.160 --> 54:51.204
Tell him you couldn't find me.
Tell him anything.

54:51.204 --> 54:53.498
I can't leave Haddonfield now.

54:53.498 --> 54:56.042
I'm afraid you don't
have a choice.

54:57.001 --> 54:59.337
There's a marshal
waiting for you outside.

55:16.562 --> 55:17.688
<i>Laurie?</i>

55:22.443 --> 55:23.653
Listen,

55:25.363 --> 55:28.032
I know that you
don't know me very well,

55:29.575 --> 55:31.869
but I just wanna
let you know that

55:32.912 --> 55:34.914
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

55:35.915 --> 55:36.958
Okay?

55:37.917 --> 55:39.085
Promise.

55:44.549 --> 55:45.716
<i>Laurie?</i>

55:53.766 --> 55:54.934
Shit!

56:11.868 --> 56:12.952
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

56:15.997 --> 56:17.665
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

56:22.378 --> 56:23.588
Dr. Mixter!

56:40.980 --> 56:42.356
<i>Dr. Miner?</i>

56:47.153 --> 56:49.614
Dr. Mixter? It's an emergency.

56:58.456 --> 57:00.750
Dr. Mixter, it's Laurie Strode.

57:01.334 --> 57:03.753
She's had a reaction
to the medication.

57:03.753 --> 57:05.588
You better come quick!

57:10.760 --> 57:12.094
Dr. Mixter.

57:53.970 --> 57:55.972
This is ridiculous!
I'm gonna go find Mrs. Alves.

58:05.773 --> 58:07.108
Mrs. Alves?

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:13.901
Laurie? You okay?

01:02:40.798 --> 01:02:42.299
We'll find him.

01:02:42.716 --> 01:02:44.468
Where you gonna look?

01:02:44.718 --> 01:02:46.136
I don't know.

01:02:47.471 --> 01:02:48.889
Neither do I.

01:03:18.335 --> 01:03:19.670
Mr. Garrett?

01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:46.905
<i>Mr. Garrett?</i>

01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:14.558
Mr. Garrett?

01:04:17.436 --> 01:04:18.812
Mr. Garrett?

01:04:20.647 --> 01:04:21.690
Sorry.

01:04:22.858 --> 01:04:26.070
Listen, I can't find anybody.

01:04:27.321 --> 01:04:29.615
Budd's gone, Mrs. Alves is gone.

01:04:31.367 --> 01:04:32.451
We gotta find Laurie.

01:04:33.243 --> 01:04:35.204
All right, listen...

01:04:35.871 --> 01:04:38.707
I want you to check the
East Wing again, all right?

01:04:39.416 --> 01:04:41.752
And if you don't find anybody, I
want you to get into your oar

01:04:41.752 --> 01:04:44.213
and drive out to the sheriff's
station and get someone out here,

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:47.216
all right?

01:04:49.176 --> 01:04:50.386
Okay.

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:51.762
Okay. I'll keep looking.

01:05:12.616 --> 01:05:13.826
Hello?

01:05:47.192 --> 01:05:48.360
Jesus!

01:08:33.524 --> 01:08:34.693
Laurie!

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:41.366
Laurie! Laurie, wait!

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:45.703
Wait, Laurie!

01:11:42.255 --> 01:11:43.215
Come on!

01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.905
You didn't believe me.
Nobody did.

01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:32.282
I'm sorry.

01:13:32.699 --> 01:13:36.119
Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry
for that little town back there.

01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:39.122
It'll be years
before they forget this.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.960
Dr. Loomis, I think there's
something else you should know.

01:13:44.628 --> 01:13:47.213
Did you see the blackboard back
there at the elementary school?

01:13:47.797 --> 01:13:48.882
Yeah.

01:13:49.466 --> 01:13:54.763
In order to appease the gods, the
Druid priests held fire rituals.

01:13:55.513 --> 01:14:01.144
Prisoners of war, criminals,
the insane, animals were

01:14:02.187 --> 01:14:04.648
burned alive in baskets.

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:07.108
By observing the way they died,

01:14:07.108 --> 01:14:10.153
the Druids believed they could
see omens of the future.

01:14:11.988 --> 01:14:14.950
Two thousand years later
we've come no further.

01:14:16.493 --> 01:14:19.537
Samhain isn't the evil spirit.

01:14:20.163 --> 01:14:23.333
It isn't goblins
and ghosts or witches,

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.504
it's the unconscious mind.

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:32.175
We're all afraid of
the dark inside ourselves.

01:14:34.761 --> 01:14:36.721
Dr. Loomis,
please, listen to me.

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:39.808
There's a file on Michael
Myers that nobody knew about.

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:40.934
I've seen everything.

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.394
No! No, it was hidden,

01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:45.188
sealed by the court
after his parents were killed.

01:14:46.231 --> 01:14:48.775
Now, after the Governor heard
what happened tonight,

01:14:48.775 --> 01:14:51.277
he authorized Dr. Rogers
to open it.

01:14:51.528 --> 01:14:52.862
What file?

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.740
It isn't fair.

01:14:55.740 --> 01:14:57.826
They should have allowed you
to examine everything.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:02.122
That girl, that Strode girl,

01:15:02.122 --> 01:15:04.332
that's Michael Myers' sister!

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.753
She was born two years
before he was committed.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:11.172
Two years after,
his parents died,

01:15:11.172 --> 01:15:13.008
and she was adopted
by the Strodes.

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:15.593
They requested that
the records be sealed

01:15:15.593 --> 01:15:17.178
in order to protect the family.

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:19.431
Jesus, don't you see what he's
doing here in Haddonfield?

01:15:19.431 --> 01:15:20.890
He killed one sister
15 years ago,

01:15:20.890 --> 01:15:22.225
now he's trying
to kill the other!

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:26.146
Tonight, after I shot him,
where did they take her?

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.148
The clinic.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:30.233
The clinic? Where...
Do you know this area well?

01:15:30.942 --> 01:15:32.110
A little bit.

01:15:32.110 --> 01:15:33.278
Where is the hospital located?

01:15:33.278 --> 01:15:35.447
Dr. Loomis, we're under
orders from the Governor.

01:15:35.447 --> 01:15:37.657
It's back on Route 17,
about three miles.

01:15:37.657 --> 01:15:39.617
Turn this car around, now!

01:15:39.617 --> 01:15:41.411
I can't do that.
I've got orders!

01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:43.038
Those orders just changed!

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:44.414
Dr. Loomis!

01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:46.458
Doctor, you're getting yourself
into a lot of trouble.

01:15:46.916 --> 01:15:49.586
What is it you fellows usually do?
Fire a warning shot, right?

01:16:24.496 --> 01:16:25.497
Jimmy?

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:38.051
It's all right. We're...

01:16:38.843 --> 01:16:40.887
We're gonna get out of here.

01:16:52.190 --> 01:16:53.233
I think...

01:17:49.455 --> 01:17:50.999
I ought to handcuff
you to the wheel,

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:52.876
but I have a feeling I'm
going to need you in there.

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:54.419
Can I trust you?

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:57.922
What have I got to lose
except my job?

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.843
Help me.

01:18:03.928 --> 01:18:05.221
Help!

01:18:06.222 --> 01:18:07.307
Help!

01:18:09.726 --> 01:18:11.436
Help me!

01:18:20.361 --> 01:18:22.947
Go and check all the
rooms down there. Go on!

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.241
Dr. Loomis! You stay
with me and shut up!

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.068
Help!

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:04.113
Help!

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:07.075
Help!

01:19:08.618 --> 01:19:09.661
Help!

01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:14.958
Help! Help!

01:19:16.334 --> 01:19:17.418
Help!

01:19:17.794 --> 01:19:19.045
Help!

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:21.297
Please!

01:19:22.006 --> 01:19:23.132
Please!

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:26.928
Please! Help!

01:19:28.513 --> 01:19:29.681
Help me!

01:19:29.681 --> 01:19:31.349
Come on, get in!

01:20:05.717 --> 01:20:07.510
Stop! He's dead.

01:20:07.719 --> 01:20:09.679
No, he's not! Look at him!
He's still breathing!

01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:13.474
Okay.

01:20:15.518 --> 01:20:17.186
There's a two-way radio
in the marshal's car.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:20.023
I want you to go outside, get
on that radio and get Hunt!

01:20:21.065 --> 01:20:22.692
Now, wait a minute!

01:20:22.692 --> 01:20:24.527
I'm the only one
authorized to use that.

01:20:24.861 --> 01:20:25.903
Move!

01:20:30.283 --> 01:20:32.994
I'm sorry I left you.
Are you all right?

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.249
Why won't he die?

01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:42.378
Get away from him!

01:20:42.754 --> 01:20:44.255
But he stopped breathing!

01:20:44.255 --> 01:20:45.465
No!

01:21:51.906 --> 01:21:53.491
Unit calling, identify.

01:21:53.741 --> 01:21:56.285
Marion Chambers with
Dr. Loomis at the clinic.

01:21:56.285 --> 01:21:57.370
He's here.

01:21:57.370 --> 01:22:00.081
10-4. Unit calling,
identify suspect.

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:01.541
Michael Myers!

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:03.126
Just get your ass over here!

01:22:33.698 --> 01:22:35.616
Come on, come on, come on. No!

01:22:35.783 --> 01:22:36.909
Take it. No!

01:22:37.785 --> 01:22:38.870
Take it!

01:23:30.963 --> 01:23:31.881
Michael?

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:50.107
Michael, stop!

01:25:20.948 --> 01:25:23.451
He's an animal! He's an animal!

01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:25.411
Go on, get out.

01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:28.831
Get out, now!

01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:38.341
It's time, Michael.

01:26:57.461 --> 01:26:58.921
What's the count?

01:26:58.921 --> 01:27:01.298
Ten, so far.

01:27:09.265 --> 01:27:11.308
If I could just
get a word or two.

01:27:11.308 --> 01:27:13.686
- Do you have any first-hand information...
- Just leave her alone.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:15.271
About what
happened inside the hospital?

01:27:18.065 --> 01:27:19.150
Can't I ride in front?

01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:21.360
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I have to put you in back.

01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:23.779
You ready?
Watch out for your feet.

01:27:24.071 --> 01:27:25.823
She's now being assisted
out of the wheelchair...

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:26.991
Up we go. Careful. And foot.

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:28.325
And into the ambulance.

01:27:29.618 --> 01:27:32.788
Big step. Big step.

01:27:33.122 --> 01:27:34.415
Okay.

01:27:35.458 --> 01:27:37.585
Keep the leg up, we'll have
you out of here in a second.

01:27:41.172 --> 01:27:42.131
Okay.
