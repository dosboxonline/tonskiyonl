WEBVTT

01:56.411 --> 01:59.456
Aeron Bracken, worst horseman among us.

02:01.958 --> 02:03.752
Must be my swordsmanship.

02:04.961 --> 02:06.171
Can you even get that thing up?

02:06.880 --> 02:08.673
Well enough for killing Blackwoods.

02:09.049 --> 02:10.175
Bracken!

02:16.056 --> 02:19.017
Put the boundary stones back.

02:20.185 --> 02:21.645
We didn't move them.

02:21.645 --> 02:23.647
Did they move themselves, then?

02:23.647 --> 02:26.483
Just rolled their way over
so Bracken cows can fill their bellies

02:26.483 --> 02:28.360
- on Blackwood grass?
- The assize at Riverrun--

02:28.360 --> 02:29.903
Fuck the assize

02:30.946 --> 02:32.280
and fuck you.

02:33.031 --> 02:34.282
This is our land.

02:40.747 --> 02:42.582
It's Bracken land.

02:46.461 --> 02:49.089
- Babe-killer.
- What did you say?

02:53.969 --> 02:57.514
Your false queen,
Rhaenyra, is a kinslayer.

02:58.598 --> 03:02.018
Your uncle declared for Aegon, did he?

03:04.896 --> 03:08.817
Well then, let me tell you

03:08.817 --> 03:13.321
Aegon Targaryen is no true king

03:14.281 --> 03:18.201
just as you are no true knight.

03:18.869 --> 03:22.914
You're both craven, little cunts!

03:32.716 --> 03:34.259
You wouldn't dare.

04:16.927 --> 04:19.346
He is the basest of villains.

04:19.888 --> 04:22.099
He sullies the grave of his brother.

04:23.975 --> 04:26.937
I cannot fault him for keeping his oath.

04:29.564 --> 04:32.275
And what of those who sent him?

04:53.588 --> 04:56.591
Otto Hightower
would never have allowed this.

04:58.760 --> 05:01.388
Hotter blood has prevailed, I think.

05:02.431 --> 05:04.266
The young men have taken the bit
in their teeth.

05:04.266 --> 05:06.351
They wish to punish, to avenge.

05:08.562 --> 05:10.480
Soon they will not even remember
what it was

05:10.480 --> 05:12.732
that began the war in the first place.

05:12.732 --> 05:15.152
That is easy enough.
They usurped my throne.

05:15.152 --> 05:17.154
That is one answer.

05:21.283 --> 05:23.910
Or was it when the child was beheaded?

05:26.121 --> 05:28.749
Or when Aemond killed Luke

05:32.002 --> 05:35.005
or when Luke took Aemond's eye?

05:35.964 --> 05:38.759
We teeter now at the point
where none of it will matter.

05:40.218 --> 05:42.596
And the desire to kill and burn takes hold

05:42.596 --> 05:44.681
and reason is forgotten.

05:46.683 --> 05:48.852
There may be another way.

05:52.397 --> 05:54.316
Alicent Hightower.

05:58.653 --> 06:02.282
When last we met,
Alicent said I would make a fine queen.

06:02.908 --> 06:04.451
You've seen what has happened since then.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.870
She came to me in the hours
after your lord father's death.

06:06.870 --> 06:08.038
She knows war is coming

06:08.038 --> 06:11.124
and that it'll be savage
beyond all compare.

06:12.334 --> 06:17.297
There is no war so hateful to the gods
as a war between kin.

06:21.343 --> 06:24.054
And no war so bloody
as a war between dragons.

06:25.388 --> 06:29.017
- I do not believe she wants it.
- She sent a raven.

06:30.602 --> 06:32.145
I do not care to read her message.

06:33.063 --> 06:33.980
What she did--

06:33.980 --> 06:36.024
It is not her but the men around her
who seek bloodshed.

06:36.024 --> 06:37.943
She permitted it.

06:39.611 --> 06:42.447
As you permitted the murder
of a little boy in his bed.

06:50.872 --> 06:55.710
Alicent is in King's Landing.
Her son sits my throne.

06:57.712 --> 07:00.132
There is nothing more to be said.

07:15.063 --> 07:16.565
Is all well, lord Hand?

07:20.110 --> 07:22.529
Only they'll be waiting.

08:03.612 --> 08:04.780
...there have been tidings in--

08:13.914 --> 08:16.917
Good morrow, Your Grace. My lords.

08:24.925 --> 08:28.470
- Forgive my lateness.
- Important business, no doubt.

08:28.470 --> 08:30.972
You've appointed new knights
to the Kingsguard, Your Grace.

08:30.972 --> 08:33.183
To replace those we lost.

08:33.183 --> 08:35.519
The last one needlessly, some might say.

08:37.938 --> 08:41.066
Ser Arryk was awarded the great duty
of ending Rhaenyra's challenge.

08:41.066 --> 08:42.651
He failed to discharge it.

08:42.651 --> 08:44.277
He failed because the scheme was rash.

08:44.277 --> 08:46.613
Perhaps, Your Grace,
but we cannot all hide in our castles

08:46.613 --> 08:47.781
waiting for war to come to us.

08:47.781 --> 08:49.449
As now it surely will.

08:49.449 --> 08:51.701
As, now, it already has.

08:52.702 --> 08:55.789
House Bracken took it upon themselves
to attack the Blackwoods,

08:55.789 --> 08:58.041
who declared for the pretender.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.127
Lord Samwell Blackwood himself is slain.

09:00.127 --> 09:02.796
Good. First blood in our name.

09:03.380 --> 09:05.966
Both sides took heavy losses, Your Grace.

09:05.966 --> 09:09.678
I'm not entirely certain
we can declare this a victory.

09:09.678 --> 09:12.055
The Blackwoods and the Brackens
have feuded for centuries.

09:12.055 --> 09:14.599
This is nothing more
than an excuse for them to indulge

09:14.599 --> 09:16.518
their ancient grudge. It's no true war.

09:18.270 --> 09:20.063
Call it what you will.

09:20.063 --> 09:22.107
I call it war.

09:23.150 --> 09:24.276
And so will Dragonstone.

09:25.277 --> 09:29.114
The question is,
what are we going to do about it?

09:34.745 --> 09:37.664
We send a raven to Lord Tully.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.916
These houses are his vassals,
are they not?

09:39.916 --> 09:41.793
He must control them.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.754
Lord Grover Tully is a flaccid, old fool

09:43.754 --> 09:45.964
who couldn't control his cock in a cunny.

09:47.048 --> 09:48.049
Begging your pardon, Your Grace.

09:48.049 --> 09:50.051
Do you have any better
suggestions, Lord Jasper?

09:50.051 --> 09:51.887
Your lord uncle Ormund
marches from Oldtown

09:51.887 --> 09:54.264
at the head of a great host, Your Grace.

09:54.264 --> 09:56.808
And your brother Daeron's dragon
nears fighting age.

09:56.808 --> 09:58.185
Call on them to suppress the Riverlands.

09:58.185 --> 09:59.728
Alas, they are months away.

09:59.728 --> 10:03.106
My lord brother Jason
is raising a great army at Casterly Rock.

10:03.106 --> 10:06.777
In a matter of weeks, he will be able
to harass the Blackwoods from the west.

10:06.777 --> 10:10.280
Should we not aim to unite these armies
and then strike as one?

10:10.280 --> 10:12.949
The great military mind of the Citadel.

10:12.949 --> 10:14.743
- I served the realm--
- Do remind me,

10:14.743 --> 10:16.620
which link in your chain
denotes the art of war?

10:16.620 --> 10:18.747
This council must rediscover
the discipline it lately had

10:18.747 --> 10:20.290
if it's to be of any use.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.167
The Riverlands are the key to the war.

10:23.251 --> 10:25.796
Harrenhal is the key to the Riverlands.

10:25.796 --> 10:27.422
I will ride out with those
I can muster here.

10:27.547 --> 10:29.508
Men I know, men I've trained.

10:29.508 --> 10:32.427
You need time to raise
the numbers to challenge the Rivermen.

10:32.427 --> 10:33.845
Speed is my ally.

10:33.845 --> 10:37.057
I will turn the Crownland houses
who declared for Rhaenyra to our cause.

10:37.057 --> 10:40.310
We will add their numbers to our own
and then turn west.

10:40.310 --> 10:45.649
Where I will enlist the Brackens,
subdue the Riverlands, and take Harrenhal.

10:46.483 --> 10:48.652
So impatient to ride with so few men.

10:49.194 --> 10:52.072
So like to be destroyed
by the first stronghold you meet.

10:52.072 --> 10:54.574
- A bold scheme indeed.
- Well, the gods favor the bold.

10:54.574 --> 10:56.034
They did not favor Ser Arryk.

10:58.286 --> 11:00.080
What say you, my king?

11:02.124 --> 11:04.459
And you'll take Aemond and Vhagar?

11:04.459 --> 11:07.087
Vhagar will remain here

11:08.171 --> 11:09.172
to defend the city.

11:10.465 --> 11:13.009
Good. To war, then.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.763
- I'll come, too, with Sunfyre.
- Aegon.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.973
- Your Grace.
- You'll need a dragon.

11:17.973 --> 11:19.516
My plan is not to draw attention.

11:19.641 --> 11:22.561
And what will you do
if you encounter one or more

11:22.561 --> 11:23.812
of Rhaenyra's dragons?

11:23.812 --> 11:25.230
She'll want to answer for Ser Arryk.

11:25.230 --> 11:28.024
We will be more like to encounter one
if we field one of our own.

11:28.024 --> 11:31.194
That is precisely why
you must remain, brother.

11:31.194 --> 11:34.906
It's a brave thought,
but we cannot risk your loss.

11:39.119 --> 11:41.747
I'm as fearsome as any of them.

12:07.856 --> 12:10.859
I was told you turned back
from your ship to bring warning.

12:10.859 --> 12:13.737
I was not believed at first.

12:13.737 --> 12:15.447
You saved my life.

12:15.822 --> 12:18.325
What is the life of a queen worth
these days?

12:19.701 --> 12:21.578
You wish to be rewarded.

12:21.578 --> 12:24.247
As, I would think,
you would wish to reward me.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.044
What price would you set?

12:29.044 --> 12:31.379
A place at your court.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.844
You said your earnest desire
was to flee Westeros.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.679
And you let me go.

12:39.679 --> 12:43.517
You showed me grace
when you could have withheld it.

12:44.768 --> 12:46.770
I'm not often surprised.

12:50.649 --> 12:52.818
One turn for another, then.

12:53.485 --> 12:55.779
I know the workings of the Red Keep

12:55.779 --> 12:58.949
and the movements
of those who serve there.

12:58.949 --> 13:01.868
That is worth more than gold to you now.

13:02.452 --> 13:03.995
And what is my worth to you?

13:08.125 --> 13:11.461
I would punish the Hightowers
for what they have done.

13:11.461 --> 13:14.881
To me, to those who served me.

13:15.799 --> 13:20.470
But more than that, I know the struggles
of the smallfolk of King's Landing.

13:20.470 --> 13:24.433
They will be ruled either by you
or by the usurper.

13:25.392 --> 13:28.311
And only one of you has shown yourself
to be merciful.

13:29.479 --> 13:31.982
Well, I hope you do not confuse
mercy with pliancy.

13:35.986 --> 13:37.946
Are they always like this?

13:38.864 --> 13:41.408
Seasmoke, my late lord husband's dragon.

13:42.617 --> 13:44.578
He's grown restless of late.

13:44.578 --> 13:47.664
- We cannot know why.
- Maybe he's lonely.

13:56.673 --> 13:58.300
Rhaena.

13:59.468 --> 14:00.886
Your Grace.

14:03.388 --> 14:08.602
I've decided to send Joffrey to ward
with my cousin, Lady Jeyne Arryn.

14:08.602 --> 14:11.146
She has pledged an army
in return for a dragon

14:11.146 --> 14:12.147
so she will have one.

14:12.272 --> 14:16.568
Aegon and Viserys will accompany him until
a place of greater safety can be found.

14:16.568 --> 14:18.278
Tyraxes is but a hatchling.

14:18.820 --> 14:21.114
- And Stormcloud--
- I want you to go with them.

14:23.575 --> 14:25.577
The Red Keep is in disarray.

14:25.577 --> 14:27.079
They have sent one assassin in the night

14:27.079 --> 14:29.331
and their dragons
are ever a short flight away.

14:29.831 --> 14:33.001
You must take the little ones further.
To Pentos, I think.

14:33.001 --> 14:34.252
Where my mother died.

14:34.252 --> 14:36.880
It is safer than anywhere in Westeros.

14:37.964 --> 14:41.384
Write to Prince Reggio.
If he will have you, then go to him.

14:42.469 --> 14:44.513
I am sorry to put this upon you.

14:44.513 --> 14:48.600
It breaks my heart to send my boys away,
not knowing when I will see them again.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.937
But you have seen
what may befall them here.

14:51.937 --> 14:53.230
Rhaena,

14:55.148 --> 14:58.151
I need you to be the mother
to them that I cannot.

14:59.486 --> 15:03.365
Teach them, train them,
guard them as a dragon guards her eggs.

15:03.365 --> 15:04.574
And my sister?

15:06.451 --> 15:08.412
- I need Baela here.
- Because she has a dragon.

15:08.412 --> 15:10.163
I cannot promise to make you happy.

15:10.288 --> 15:16.044
But I ask you: make this sacrifice
willingly, for all of us.

15:18.046 --> 15:19.256
Your Grace.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.503
Dragon!

18:32.699 --> 18:33.909
Halt!

18:47.881 --> 18:49.549
I'm claiming Harrenhal.

18:52.385 --> 18:54.012
Apparently so.

19:15.409 --> 19:18.620
I, Ser Simon Strong,
Castellan of Harrenhal,

19:18.620 --> 19:21.498
pledge fealty to Rhaenyra
of House Targaryen,

19:21.498 --> 19:23.458
First of Her Name.

19:23.458 --> 19:26.169
I swear this by the old gods and the new.

19:28.004 --> 19:31.007
Supper is venison
with black cabbage and peas.

19:31.925 --> 19:35.554
No redcurrant. Sorry about that.

19:43.979 --> 19:45.647
That venison is well aged.

19:47.441 --> 19:48.817
Shame to let it waste.

19:52.821 --> 19:54.156
I've survived many a battle.

19:54.156 --> 19:56.908
I do not mean to be felled
by poisoned peas.

19:58.285 --> 20:03.206
I'll admit that my cook's peas aren't
exactly the stuff of legend, but poison?

20:03.206 --> 20:05.500
Well, it's an easy way
to kill a dragonrider.

20:07.961 --> 20:11.173
If you've not yet surmised,
you are welcome here.

20:11.631 --> 20:14.384
And what of your lord, Larys Strong.

20:16.636 --> 20:18.805
He who sits at the false court of Aegon?

20:18.805 --> 20:22.100
Larys Clubfoot is no lord of mine.

20:23.226 --> 20:25.687
He is a scourge upon this castle
and this family.

20:27.689 --> 20:30.692
Do you not think it's strange
that his father,

20:32.819 --> 20:36.573
my nephew, Lord Lyonel, perished by fire?

20:36.573 --> 20:40.452
And his son, too, here in this damp place?

20:42.746 --> 20:45.999
It was the first fire here since Balerion
ended the line of Harren the Black.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.919
Even in the summer,
we struggle to light the hearths.

20:48.919 --> 20:52.380
So, no, you will find no loyalty
to Larys Strong here, my prince.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.507
"Your Grace."

20:59.012 --> 21:00.847
Forgive me. I--

21:02.724 --> 21:05.685
I'd only assumed that as consort--

21:05.685 --> 21:08.188
Then we are reminded of the perilousness
of assumption.

21:09.898 --> 21:11.108
Indeed.

21:13.985 --> 21:15.404
Your Grace.

21:20.450 --> 21:23.745
What then brings you to our corner
of the Riverlands?

21:23.745 --> 21:26.832
Harrenhal is the largest castle
in the Seven Kingdoms.

21:27.874 --> 21:29.835
Or perhaps that has
escaped your attention.

21:29.835 --> 21:33.839
But it is also, not to be argumentative,
in something of a state of disrepair

21:33.839 --> 21:37.384
since your forbear incinerated much of it
with his dragon.

21:37.384 --> 21:40.595
Well, that is precisely why we must
bring it into a state of repair.

21:41.721 --> 21:44.724
Even if we possessed the coin, my prin--

21:46.268 --> 21:48.478
Your Grace, to what possible end?

21:48.478 --> 21:52.566
There are 40,000 swords in the Riverlands,
the largest undeclared host in the realm.

21:52.566 --> 21:55.277
Only Harrenhal is of a size enough
to garrison them.

21:55.277 --> 21:58.572
You should know that a substantial number
of those swords have now declared

21:58.572 --> 22:00.365
and are presently at war.

22:00.365 --> 22:03.660
Houses Bracken and Blackwood
have long detested one another.

22:03.660 --> 22:05.662
- Why?
- Oh, well...

22:07.622 --> 22:12.043
the answer to that is lost in time.

22:13.086 --> 22:16.715
Sin begets sin begets sin.

22:19.593 --> 22:22.387
Summon your lord paramount
so that I may treat with him myself

22:22.387 --> 22:24.055
and turn them to our cause.

22:24.055 --> 22:27.517
That would be Lord Grover Tully,
but he grows frail.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.519
It's said that he can no longer speak

22:31.188 --> 22:32.647
nor seal his bowels.

22:33.607 --> 22:35.317
Begging your pardon for the impression.

22:35.317 --> 22:38.236
His grip on his bannermen is weak.
They feel they can do as they please.

22:38.236 --> 22:40.030
I will speak with him nonetheless.

22:40.030 --> 22:42.282
People should obey their liege lord

22:43.241 --> 22:45.077
whatever his condition.

22:46.036 --> 22:48.038
Perhaps the presence of the crown

22:49.164 --> 22:50.791
and a dragon

22:51.333 --> 22:53.960
will sharpen minds around these parts.

22:55.378 --> 22:57.589
Might I ask, Your Grace,

22:58.632 --> 23:02.177
if you are successful,
well, when you are successful,

23:02.177 --> 23:03.470
what then?

23:04.763 --> 23:07.390
We march on King's Landing
and take the throne.

23:09.476 --> 23:11.019
The throne.

23:14.272 --> 23:18.110
It's a big chair made of swords.

23:19.653 --> 23:22.781
Standard-bearers to the front!

23:22.781 --> 23:25.283
Packhorses to the rear!

23:25.909 --> 23:28.495
Clear way for the mounted knights...

23:39.673 --> 23:43.468
Lord Commander.
Your host is mustered and ready to march.

23:43.468 --> 23:44.970
He enjoys battle.

23:50.225 --> 23:52.185
I'm glad we're together, even briefly.

23:52.185 --> 23:53.562
Ser Criston.

23:55.063 --> 23:57.941
May I present my brother,
Ser Gwayne Hightower,

23:57.941 --> 23:59.943
arrived last night from Oldtown.

23:59.943 --> 24:01.236
Ser Criston.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.866
Or mayhaps I should say, my lord Hand?

24:06.491 --> 24:08.410
Ser Gwayne, welcome to King's Landing.

24:09.161 --> 24:14.040
How exhilarating to arrive at court
after three long months on the road

24:14.040 --> 24:18.670
to find my lord father,
who served three kings faithfully,

24:18.670 --> 24:20.172
unseated as Hand of the King.

24:22.507 --> 24:25.844
And by a man from such modest beginnings.

24:27.512 --> 24:30.515
What a giddying ascent
the gods have bestowed on you.

24:32.100 --> 24:34.978
Ser Gwayne has volunteered
to accompany you into battle.

24:39.149 --> 24:41.026
We have a full complement, Your Grace.

24:41.026 --> 24:43.070
Then you shall have a fuller one.

24:44.988 --> 24:46.531
The march will be hard, Ser.

24:47.240 --> 24:51.078
No one is more delighted than I
to march out to war with a Dornishman.

24:52.829 --> 24:53.830
Sister.

25:01.963 --> 25:07.594
May the Seven guide you, good knight,
and lead you not into shadow and death.

25:09.721 --> 25:11.389
I thank Your Grace for her prayers.

25:15.352 --> 25:17.771
And request that she grant her favor

25:19.106 --> 25:21.650
that her Lord Commander may go into battle
with her blessings

25:23.235 --> 25:24.778
in his heart.

25:36.748 --> 25:37.958
Your Grace.

26:28.175 --> 26:30.177
Still no sightings.

26:31.136 --> 26:35.766
No men, no horses, no ships.

26:37.851 --> 26:39.811
- No dragons.
- Good.

26:39.811 --> 26:44.357
Then we must seize the hour and act
before our enemy does.

26:44.357 --> 26:47.152
They have penetrated our castle walls
and now the Riverlands are aflame

26:47.152 --> 26:49.362
after the Battle at the Burning Mill.

26:49.946 --> 26:52.532
How fares Prince Daemon with our army?

26:53.784 --> 26:56.953
There has been no word from Prince Daemon,
Your Grace.

26:56.953 --> 26:59.748
Then we must press what advantage
we do have.

26:59.748 --> 27:03.085
- And what is that?
- Dragons. Send them all out.

27:03.085 --> 27:06.963
Start turning Green strongholds
to our cause

27:06.963 --> 27:09.382
- and burn those who resist.
- No.

27:10.175 --> 27:13.762
If dragons begin fighting dragons,
we invite our own destruction.

27:14.888 --> 27:17.099
Fear of it is in itself a weapon.

27:17.808 --> 27:19.267
The Greens will make the same calculation.

27:22.437 --> 27:26.066
The value of a sword
is not within its scabbard.

27:26.650 --> 27:31.321
We will secure victory with armies,
not with dragons alone.

27:32.614 --> 27:33.990
The Greens understand that.

27:34.574 --> 27:36.743
The Vale and the North will send men.

27:38.203 --> 27:40.372
We must give Daemon time.

27:41.456 --> 27:44.543
Your Grace, you have witnessed
firsthand just how

27:44.543 --> 27:46.336
vulnerable you are.

27:46.336 --> 27:48.422
Prince Daemon is abroad

27:48.422 --> 27:51.466
and Aegon's factions
are enraged at the death of his son.

27:51.466 --> 27:53.635
You have never been so exposed.

27:53.635 --> 27:57.848
Perhaps it is time for you to think about
secreting yourself somewhere safe

27:58.348 --> 28:03.645
while we remain here
as a source of distraction for the enemy.

28:03.645 --> 28:05.605
You propose to conduct
the war in my absence.

28:05.605 --> 28:08.942
- It would merely be a precaution--
- It would be treason.

28:12.404 --> 28:14.573
You are fortunate you took it no further.

28:22.539 --> 28:24.166
This council would do well to remember

28:24.166 --> 28:26.793
that their queen wears
the crown of my grandsire,

28:26.793 --> 28:29.212
Jaehaerys the Conciliator.

28:29.713 --> 28:32.841
A prudent ruler,
the wisest of Targaryen kings,

28:32.841 --> 28:35.343
whose reign outlasted every other

28:37.596 --> 28:39.806
even Aegon the Conqueror's.

28:45.604 --> 28:47.481
<i>So, how do they fare?</i>

28:47.481 --> 28:49.566
<i>The ditherers of Dragonstone?</i>

28:49.566 --> 28:53.612
Rhaenyra's council is wayward.
She has a hard task.

28:53.612 --> 28:55.989
I must hope she will rise to it

28:55.989 --> 28:59.409
but I fear she'll need you by her side
sooner than late.

28:59.409 --> 29:01.495
This bread, still warm.

29:02.287 --> 29:04.289
There's broth too. I made sure of it.

29:05.749 --> 29:07.751
I am no longer an invalid.

29:14.633 --> 29:17.636
I bade farewell to Rhaena
before I returned.

29:21.098 --> 29:22.724
I wish her well.

29:24.601 --> 29:26.937
I would fight a hundred battles
before I went into exile

29:26.937 --> 29:28.980
with none but prattling babes.

29:30.482 --> 29:32.776
One of those babes is your heir.

29:33.360 --> 29:34.694
Joffrey.

29:35.362 --> 29:40.450
A boy of six who knows nothing of the sea
and yet somehow...

29:41.034 --> 29:44.955
It would displease neither Rhaenyra
nor the gods

29:44.955 --> 29:47.707
if Rhaena were named heir to Driftmark.

29:50.085 --> 29:53.088
Rhaena? Lord of the Tides?

29:53.713 --> 29:56.508
The girl knows nothing of ships,
nor even of dragons.

29:56.508 --> 29:59.010
There is Rhaena or there is Joffrey.

29:59.719 --> 30:03.723
Both soon to be far from
the creak of ships and the ocean's roar.

30:05.225 --> 30:08.395
Then we must hope to

30:09.855 --> 30:12.149
see our way forward, in time.

30:12.149 --> 30:14.443
And if there is no time?

30:16.987 --> 30:19.197
We are at war, Corlys.

30:21.074 --> 30:25.912
- If something were to befall you--
- Then it is well

30:25.912 --> 30:27.748
that I am a good sailor.

30:41.636 --> 30:43.430
I have much to attend to.

30:43.430 --> 30:45.098
Corlys, Corl--

31:08.663 --> 31:12.250
I cannot spare a fighting dragon,
but I send what I can.

31:12.250 --> 31:15.128
Stormcloud and Tyraxes are small,
but they will grow.

31:17.380 --> 31:20.217
It is for you to remind Lady Jeyne
of her pledge

31:20.217 --> 31:23.929
and persuade her of the urgency
of our need.

31:30.435 --> 31:32.646
Go safely, sister.

31:34.106 --> 31:35.732
I will be safe enough.

31:36.441 --> 31:39.945
Far away from any danger,
with only babes to nursemaid.

31:39.945 --> 31:42.239
You do a great service

31:42.239 --> 31:44.574
and may yet find yourself glad to be
out of harm's way.

31:44.574 --> 31:46.368
Do not coddle me, Baela.

31:46.368 --> 31:48.995
- Grant me at least that dignity.
- I meant no insult.

31:48.995 --> 31:50.580
We each do what we can.

31:51.331 --> 31:54.084
And here, I think, is some consolation.

31:56.837 --> 31:59.756
Tyraxes and Stormcloud
are young and vulnerable.

32:00.966 --> 32:03.969
These eggs are even more fragile.

32:05.345 --> 32:08.348
But should all come to ruin here

32:09.599 --> 32:11.518
you will bear our hope for the future.

32:14.146 --> 32:15.147
Your Grace.

32:16.565 --> 32:17.858
Mommy.

33:53.495 --> 33:54.913
My Queen.

33:57.290 --> 33:59.209
I feel sad about Jaehaerys.

34:00.544 --> 34:03.171
But I ought not to, I think.

34:04.131 --> 34:07.759
People die all the time, especially babes.

34:09.010 --> 34:12.764
They're so little,
so they're taken so easily.

34:16.309 --> 34:18.562
Sadness is a condition of motherhood.

34:19.271 --> 34:21.481
There's naught to be gained from it.

34:26.236 --> 34:29.698
That horrid procession where the smallfolk
all stared at me.

34:29.698 --> 34:33.785
I warrant they thought I had no more right
to grief than they do.

34:36.329 --> 34:39.291
Surely they lose their babes
more than highborn ladies.

34:43.962 --> 34:45.964
The Stranger comes for us all,

34:47.132 --> 34:48.759
queen and commoner.

34:50.802 --> 34:53.221
You have as much claim to grief as anyone.

34:55.515 --> 34:56.725
And you?

35:01.354 --> 35:03.148
I loved Jaehaerys, but my concern has been

35:03.148 --> 35:05.650
more for you and what you have endured.

35:08.361 --> 35:10.906
- Helaena, I--
- I forgive you.

35:12.741 --> 35:13.909
What?

35:19.039 --> 35:21.041
I said that I forgive you.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.091
Suits you, Your Grace.

35:29.633 --> 35:32.844
Valyrian steel.
Worth more than a castle.

35:32.844 --> 35:35.097
A sight to stir the passions.

35:35.764 --> 35:37.766
Aegon the Conqueror reborn.

35:37.766 --> 35:39.142
Just get on with it.

35:39.142 --> 35:40.602
At once, Your Grace.

35:40.602 --> 35:42.395
What is your business?

35:42.395 --> 35:45.440
There are rumors that the King
readies himself to fly to war.

35:46.108 --> 35:47.776
And what is it to you?

35:48.485 --> 35:50.070
Only that I think
it would benefit all of us

35:50.070 --> 35:53.448
to prevent our king from being
brutally slain by our enemies

35:53.448 --> 35:57.035
and his body parts scattered to beasts
and his court come to ruin.

35:57.035 --> 35:58.537
Would you not agree?

36:01.498 --> 36:03.250
What exquisite armor.

36:06.378 --> 36:09.339
I was given the Conqueror's name
and his crown

36:09.339 --> 36:11.633
so I shall wear his armor to war.

36:11.633 --> 36:13.718
I fly to meet Ser Criston.

36:15.178 --> 36:18.014
Small imposition before you depart then,
Your Grace.

36:29.025 --> 36:32.612
There are diverse rumors
whispered on the streets of your city.

36:32.612 --> 36:35.991
One such is that Your Grace sends
his forces to battle

36:35.991 --> 36:39.161
and, in his courage and wisdom,
flies with them.

36:41.538 --> 36:45.041
Another is that His Grace
was outwitted by his counselors

36:45.041 --> 36:48.003
and persuaded to fly to war
with Ser Criston

36:48.003 --> 36:52.340
so that Queen Alicent
may reign in his absence

36:53.133 --> 36:55.594
with Prince Aemond at her side.

36:57.179 --> 36:58.805
Absurd, of course.

37:01.892 --> 37:03.560
Who spreads these lies?

37:04.478 --> 37:06.104
It matters little.

37:06.646 --> 37:08.857
Tales take on a life of their own

37:09.691 --> 37:10.817
like weeds.

37:11.443 --> 37:13.445
Unless they are tended.

37:14.571 --> 37:16.239
Well, tend to them then.

37:24.790 --> 37:25.957
Lord Larys.

37:28.168 --> 37:32.422
My father always said he had no use
for a master of whisperers.

37:34.007 --> 37:38.220
And yet I find myself wanting for one.

37:39.888 --> 37:42.265
I should be glad of your talents.

37:46.561 --> 37:48.563
You honor me, Your Grace.

37:54.986 --> 37:57.989
Shall we escort you to the Dragonpit,
Your Grace?

38:04.788 --> 38:07.207
I think, mayhaps, I shall fly another day.

38:07.791 --> 38:10.585
Yeah, it does seem wise on reflection.

38:10.585 --> 38:12.796
You could come out with us, my king.

38:12.796 --> 38:15.132
Ser Martyn has a new squire
that wants bedding in.

38:15.757 --> 38:18.176
He's never fucked a woman.

38:18.677 --> 38:20.262
But you are sworn to chastity now.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.434
Of course, Your Grace.

38:31.606 --> 38:32.941
Yes, Your Grace.

39:10.228 --> 39:12.397
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell me you're going.

39:12.397 --> 39:14.649
- I'm not going yet.
- I've only just got here.

39:18.528 --> 39:19.654
There he is!

39:21.573 --> 39:24.201
Ulf, Ulf, come on, son!

39:26.036 --> 39:30.248
It turns out, it was her sister.
Probably should've told me.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.126
I know, I know, I know!

39:33.126 --> 39:35.253
Take that one. You'll get your pound
of flesh, don't worry.

39:35.253 --> 39:37.047
Sit yourself down, mate.

39:37.047 --> 39:38.006
Hello.

39:38.006 --> 39:39.091
I've been tellin' this fella
all about you.

39:39.091 --> 39:41.051
Oh, lads.

39:41.051 --> 39:43.220
- I've had quite a day of it.
- Yeah?

39:43.220 --> 39:45.180
Not sure I'm much for talkin'.

39:46.181 --> 39:49.601
Although, you know,
a wet whistle works wonders.

39:54.606 --> 39:57.401
Come on, Ulf, give us a flagon over there, yeah?

39:57.401 --> 40:00.570
Here, my darling, one for the flagon,
one for yourself.

40:00.570 --> 40:02.489
There's a good girl, eh?

40:06.827 --> 40:08.537
No sense of fun, some of 'em.

40:08.537 --> 40:12.124
- For you, man of Dorne.
- Dornish, are ya?

40:13.208 --> 40:14.376
Yes, I am.

40:14.376 --> 40:16.962
The part of Westeros
my house never settled.

40:16.962 --> 40:18.380
Although, it's said even Dorne

40:18.380 --> 40:20.966
mourned the passing of my grandsire.
Is that so?

40:21.550 --> 40:23.176
Who was your grandsire?

40:26.847 --> 40:29.599
They call him the Conciliator.

40:30.350 --> 40:31.435
King Jaehaerys?

40:34.146 --> 40:37.482
Thousand apologies. Please, continue.

40:37.482 --> 40:40.193
Look, I really shouldn't be
telling you this.

40:41.111 --> 40:42.571
You'll cost me my head.

40:42.571 --> 40:44.239
You are saying you're a Targaryen?

40:50.203 --> 40:53.415
I'm the son of Baelon the Brave.

40:54.207 --> 40:59.087
Bastard brother to Prince Daemon
and the late King Viserys.

40:59.087 --> 41:04.384
Uncle to the one true queen,
Rhaenyra Targaryen.

41:05.385 --> 41:08.096
The blood of the dragon
runs through these veins.

41:08.096 --> 41:11.558
And, yes, men would take my head for it.

41:14.352 --> 41:16.521
A Dragonseed must watch his own neck

41:16.521 --> 41:20.233
when he has no white-cloaked guardsmen
to do it for him.

41:22.152 --> 41:24.446
You do not look very
much like King Viserys

41:25.489 --> 41:26.990
or Prince Daemon.

41:29.910 --> 41:31.078
How do you know what they look like?

41:31.078 --> 41:36.625
He speaks truth, right enough.
Look, you can tell by his hair.

41:36.625 --> 41:39.961
Yeah, 'cause I'm their
half-brother, you fuckwit.

41:39.961 --> 41:42.464
Yeah, I'll tell you who else
doesn't have silver hair.

41:42.464 --> 41:47.052
The rightful heir to the Iron Throne,
my nephew, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon.

41:51.181 --> 41:52.808
Here's your other nephew.

42:00.065 --> 42:03.193
- All hail the King!
- All hail the King!

42:04.986 --> 42:08.573
Drinks for all!
At the pleasure of the crown!

42:13.412 --> 42:15.539
At the pleasure of the crown!

42:16.873 --> 42:18.875
Sit down. Sit yourself down.

42:18.875 --> 42:21.086
- Sit!
- Drink the wine, boy.

42:21.086 --> 42:23.255
- Come on, then!
- Drink up, little piggy!

42:24.589 --> 42:26.383
This night is for you.

42:27.175 --> 42:28.176
You!

42:36.852 --> 42:39.771
Did I tell you I came here as a lad?

42:39.771 --> 42:45.318
It's a little tame,
but a good a place as any to get it wet.

42:46.862 --> 42:48.989
I know just the tutor for you, my boy.

42:52.492 --> 42:53.577
No.

42:53.577 --> 42:55.537
She's worth three times the price.

42:58.331 --> 43:00.041
Oh, gods be good.

43:01.501 --> 43:02.502
That's you!

43:02.502 --> 43:08.258
Her name is Sylvi, or Selyse or,
I don't know, something like that.

43:17.350 --> 43:18.935
Aemond, the fierce!

43:20.145 --> 43:22.272
You have come so far

43:22.272 --> 43:25.525
and yet you still
lie with your very first.

43:26.777 --> 43:29.738
What a fine, sweet thing.

43:31.448 --> 43:33.492
Did you fuck her like a hound?

43:37.579 --> 43:39.706
You see, I do not exaggerate.

43:39.706 --> 43:41.875
Such is the madam's prowess,

43:41.875 --> 43:45.545
that even now my brother
will not sample another.

43:48.340 --> 43:50.050
Hard luck for your squire, though.

43:50.050 --> 43:54.012
As you can see, she--
she's now very much occupied.

44:03.188 --> 44:05.148
Your squire is welcome to her.

44:06.858 --> 44:08.652
One whore is as good as another.

45:25.979 --> 45:28.482
Ser Gwayne! Halt!

45:34.362 --> 45:37.491
Ser Gwayne,
our company is camped back yonder.

45:38.075 --> 45:40.327
On the cold, hard ground.

45:40.327 --> 45:44.414
Which is why we make for the Bull,
a tavern with an excellent reputation

45:44.414 --> 45:46.124
on the Rosby Road, not two miles away

45:46.124 --> 45:48.251
- if memory serves.
- We march to make the first strike

45:48.251 --> 45:49.419
in the name of His Grace.

45:50.420 --> 45:54.424
I assure you, my nephew
will not begrudge me a night of comfort.

46:00.055 --> 46:05.268
If it soothes your brow, Cole, we will
rendezvous with your army at first light.

46:05.769 --> 46:08.939
Or, if their wine is good,
perhaps a little after first light.

46:11.525 --> 46:13.527
- We're exposed.
- What?

46:15.487 --> 46:18.198
- Cole?
- Get to the trees!

48:16.775 --> 48:18.777
A good showing, Ser Criston.

48:22.030 --> 48:23.323
I am in your debt.

48:23.323 --> 48:25.742
They know we're abroad.
They'll be hunting.

48:25.742 --> 48:29.287
And we must move under the trees
and by cover of dark, starting tonight.

48:30.372 --> 48:32.582
And no fucking inns.

48:35.794 --> 48:37.295
<i>Ser Criston Cole</i>

48:38.380 --> 48:41.174
with some half-dozen other knights,
I'm sure of it.

48:41.174 --> 48:43.301
Perhaps a scout party for a greater army.

48:43.301 --> 48:45.429
The ravens confirm it, Your Grace.

48:45.429 --> 48:51.810
Lord Farring has reported a larger force
moving northeast towards Rosby.

48:51.810 --> 48:54.563
Could you be certain it was Cole
from such a great height?

48:54.563 --> 48:57.065
It was not such a great height,
Your Grace.

48:59.443 --> 49:02.821
You said not to engage,
so I didn't, exactly.

49:02.821 --> 49:06.950
Your Grace, we commend the Lady Baela
for her sharp eyes

49:06.950 --> 49:08.493
but we can tarry no longer.

49:08.493 --> 49:10.746
The time for action is surely now.

49:10.746 --> 49:13.582
Your Grace, I must agree
and request your permission

49:13.582 --> 49:16.251
to return to Rook's Rest
and fortify my lands.

49:16.251 --> 49:19.629
I shouldn't fret, Lord Simon.
They'll be making for Harrenhal.

49:19.629 --> 49:21.590
'Tis Prince Daemon who ought to worry.

49:21.590 --> 49:23.175
Prince Daemon has Caraxes.

49:23.175 --> 49:27.304
Cole will look to increase his numbers
and he may call upon a dragon of his own.

49:27.304 --> 49:31.141
This is why you must act now, Your Grace.

49:31.141 --> 49:33.810
Loose the dragons.
Root Cole out and burn him.

49:49.868 --> 49:51.870
I have heard your arguments.

49:53.497 --> 49:55.499
And will consider them.

51:54.409 --> 51:57.120
Always coming and going, aren't you?

52:03.585 --> 52:05.921
And I have to clean up afterwards.

52:47.337 --> 52:49.256
You will die in this place.

53:08.525 --> 53:11.403
...my youngest brother,
Emmon, would stand at guard

53:11.403 --> 53:13.405
with the soldiers when
he was three years old.

53:13.405 --> 53:14.823
Father has sent him to the Citadel.

53:14.823 --> 53:17.325
- Now, if you ask me--
- Thank you, Elinda.

53:17.951 --> 53:19.161
Your Grace.

53:26.585 --> 53:29.588
What do you know of the movements
of Alicent Hightower?

53:33.049 --> 53:35.886
Would you take her hostage?

53:36.386 --> 53:38.472
Or kill her outright?

53:38.472 --> 53:41.558
I would speak with her, myself.

53:42.392 --> 53:44.728
Killing her would be easier.

53:46.146 --> 53:49.357
If war can be averted,
it is my duty to avert it.

53:50.108 --> 53:52.736
I have reason to believe she may be
of the same opinion.

53:53.612 --> 53:56.782
She sent a raven.
She has expressed her remorse.

53:56.782 --> 53:59.367
I can have a message brought to her,
in secret.

53:59.367 --> 54:01.161
She would not agree to it.

54:01.161 --> 54:07.042
She would suspect some subterfuge,
as would I, if I received such a message.

54:07.042 --> 54:10.378
I must see her face to face.

54:13.757 --> 54:15.634
She is the queen dowager.

54:15.634 --> 54:18.720
She goes nowhere without many eyes
watching her.

54:22.891 --> 54:23.934
Unless...

54:27.938 --> 54:30.148
- 'Tis fraught.
- Speak it.

54:31.316 --> 54:34.945
There are fishing boats
aplenty in the bay.

54:35.779 --> 54:37.364
The city depends on them.

54:37.364 --> 54:39.908
Daemon made the journey unhindered.

54:39.908 --> 54:43.078
- But if I'm recognized--
- You may be surprised to learn it,

54:43.078 --> 54:46.957
but most folk pay no mind
to a woman who has not dressed as a queen

54:46.957 --> 54:50.043
or allured herself for the eyes of men.

54:53.296 --> 54:56.800
So, I make my way to the Red Keep,
I presume,

54:56.800 --> 54:58.844
and ring the bell.

54:59.177 --> 55:01.721
Or do I scale the wall
and enter at her window?

55:01.721 --> 55:06.560
There is one place Alicent goes
outside the castle walls

55:08.437 --> 55:10.522
where you may yet find her alone.

55:31.668 --> 55:33.962
Stop. Search the carts.

55:38.467 --> 55:40.177
What's your business here?

55:40.177 --> 55:43.472
Move 'em on through, move 'em on through.

58:06.031 --> 58:07.616
No, no.

58:07.616 --> 58:08.950
What--

58:10.952 --> 58:13.580
- What--
- I must speak with you.

58:18.126 --> 58:19.586
If I cry out?

58:20.587 --> 58:21.546
Your knights would find me.

58:21.546 --> 58:25.467
I would be taken or slain,
though not before I killed you.

58:27.385 --> 58:28.386
And then what?

58:32.599 --> 58:33.975
I have begun badly.

58:47.739 --> 58:50.534
We watched the tourney
together, you and I,

58:50.534 --> 58:53.245
the day my brother was born.

58:54.913 --> 58:57.624
We knew, even then,
that men trained up for battle

58:57.624 --> 59:01.711
are eager to fight,
to seek blood and glory.

59:02.170 --> 59:04.005
But you are--

59:05.882 --> 59:09.094
I know you do not have
that desire within you.

59:15.350 --> 59:17.769
Rhaenys has counseled me.

59:17.769 --> 59:22.149
She said she saw in you a wish to avert
the worst of what may now come.

59:25.152 --> 59:27.112
So you've come to surrender then?

59:28.822 --> 59:33.452
I have come to see if we may uncover
some path towards peace.

59:34.828 --> 59:37.622
My dragons are restless.
They smell battle.

59:37.622 --> 59:39.916
But if you and I may come to terms--

59:40.041 --> 59:42.043
There are no terms now.

59:43.587 --> 59:45.172
You have no army,

59:45.172 --> 59:47.215
your allies turn from you
when they hear of your depravity,

59:47.215 --> 59:49.009
your hands are bloodied in a crime
I could never have

59:49.009 --> 59:51.720
- imagined you--
- The trespass was not mine.

59:52.637 --> 59:54.264
Think what you will.

59:54.973 --> 59:57.392
I am a mother too and you have yet
to answer for the murder of my son.

59:57.517 --> 01:00:00.854
- I repudiate that act with all my heart.
- Of course, you do.

01:00:01.563 --> 01:00:03.774
And the usurping of
my rightful inheritance?

01:00:21.708 --> 01:00:23.043
Have you now stooped so low

01:00:23.043 --> 01:00:26.296
that you will countenance the suffering
and death of thousands

01:00:26.296 --> 01:00:27.839
in order that your feckless son--

01:00:27.839 --> 01:00:29.549
Your father changed his mind.

01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.510
Oh, so you say.

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:34.304
And so your father
has proclaimed to the realm.

01:00:34.304 --> 01:00:37.015
I saw the king that night.

01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:41.228
Mere hours before I left him,
he had affirmed my right to the throne,

01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:44.147
a right he upheld steadfastly,

01:00:44.147 --> 01:00:46.858
every day of his life
after my mother died.

01:00:48.443 --> 01:00:50.445
And yet, you will maintain that
his mind was changed

01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:52.406
- in an instant?
- I will.

01:00:53.907 --> 01:00:55.492
You lie.

01:00:56.451 --> 01:00:58.078
No, Rhaenyra.

01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:03.041
My father loved me, Alicent.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.836
And I believe he loved you, too.

01:01:07.546 --> 01:01:09.548
Did you betray him at the very last?

01:01:11.133 --> 01:01:13.218
When was your plan first laid?

01:01:13.218 --> 01:01:17.013
- Was your ambition so keen--
- He changed his mind, Rhaenyra.

01:01:17.013 --> 01:01:18.723
He changed his mind.

01:01:23.061 --> 01:01:26.356
I swear this to you
on the memory of my mother.

01:01:30.485 --> 01:01:33.405
I have been at times unkind
but never untrue.

01:01:33.864 --> 01:01:35.449
I pronounced before all
gathered in that room

01:01:35.449 --> 01:01:37.951
that you would make a fine queen.

01:01:38.910 --> 01:01:40.787
Do you think me capable
of such naked deceit?

01:02:01.683 --> 01:02:03.894
What did he say, at the end?

01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:09.316
Did he speak my name?

01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:31.088
He was weary.

01:02:33.548 --> 01:02:36.176
It was hard, at times, to understand.

01:02:38.303 --> 01:02:39.846
But he spoke Aegon's name.

01:02:48.313 --> 01:02:51.400
He said he was the prince
that was promised to unite the realm.

01:02:52.526 --> 01:02:55.070
- What?
- I desire peace as you do but if--

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:57.406
Did my father use those words?

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:58.657
The Prince That Was Promised?

01:03:01.118 --> 01:03:02.494
Did he?

01:03:02.494 --> 01:03:04.246
Yes, he did.

01:03:07.499 --> 01:03:11.253
He spoke to you
of the Song of Ice and Fire?

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.929
It's a story he once told

01:03:22.264 --> 01:03:24.683
about Aegon the Conqueror.

01:03:30.188 --> 01:03:32.190
The Conqueror.

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:51.626
You must go before you are discovered.

01:03:51.626 --> 01:03:53.587
- There's been a mistake.
- There's been no mistake.

01:03:53.587 --> 01:03:54.671
Please.

01:03:56.548 --> 01:03:58.550
You can prevent this, Alicent.

01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:02.179
A terrible war is looming

01:04:02.179 --> 01:04:05.182
and even victory may be so bloody
as to be counted a loss.

01:04:05.182 --> 01:04:08.852
- Do not let your pride blind--
- There's been no mistake.

01:04:12.939 --> 01:04:15.067
My father is gone from court.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.487
Cole is on the march, Aemond--

01:04:20.947 --> 01:04:22.783
you know what Aemond is.

01:04:29.372 --> 01:04:31.792
- It's too late, Rhaenyra.
- Alicent.
