00:27.603 --> 00:30.770
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Heraklion.</i>

00:30.937 --> 00:35.020
<i>The local time is 3 am, and
the temperature is 28 degrees Celsius.</i>

00:35.228 --> 00:37.353
<i>Please remain in your seats</i>

00:37.353 --> 00:39.603
<i>until the aircraft
has come to a complete standstill</i>

00:39.812 --> 00:42.437
<i>and the captain has switched off
the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

00:42.603 --> 00:44.645
<i>Please take care
when opening the overhead bins</i>

00:44.853 --> 00:47.478
<i>as items may have been
dislodged during the flight.</i>

00:47.478 --> 00:49.770
<i>We thank you for flying with us today</i>

00:49.895 --> 00:52.687
<i>and look forward to
seeing you again soon.</i>

00:52.895 --> 00:55.270
<i>Please check with ground staff
for connecting flights</i>

00:55.270 --> 00:57.562
<i>or further travel
to your final destination.</i>

00:57.728 --> 01:00.353
<i>Say uh, ah, Malia!</i>

01:00.478 --> 01:03.437
<i>Say uh, ah, Malia!</i>

01:06.187 --> 01:08.103
I'll tell you why I'm so tired.

01:08.562 --> 01:11.353
- That would be you, Em.
- Why?

01:11.353 --> 01:13.937
What do you mean, "why"? What about
when she was booking the holiday?

01:13.937 --> 01:16.228
You did no work.
All this "I'm exhausted."

01:16.228 --> 01:18.853
I woke up to 20 messages from you.

01:18.978 --> 01:21.437
"We have to be there four hours before!"

01:21.562 --> 01:23.103
If it wasn't for me,
would you be here?

01:23.103 --> 01:24.437
Would you be here?

01:25.478 --> 01:28.978
Ah! We're in Malia, babe! Baby!

01:45.353 --> 01:47.062
It's kinda cold.

01:48.103 --> 01:51.353
I'm going in! Come on!

01:51.353 --> 01:53.895
Oh, she's in! She's in! She's in!

01:54.020 --> 01:55.645
Oh!

01:55.645 --> 01:57.228
I don't think we should do this.

01:57.228 --> 01:59.062
I don't think it's supposed
to be this cold.

01:59.062 --> 02:00.853
You'll get used to it.

02:04.562 --> 02:08.312
<i>♪ Oh my God, oh my God
When I see you I should run</i>

02:08.312 --> 02:12.312
<i>♪ I'm saying things I've never said
Doing things I've never done</i>

02:16.562 --> 02:18.853
I fucking love you guys.

02:18.853 --> 02:22.562
- I fucking love you guys!
- Best holiday ever!

02:38.645 --> 02:40.228
Oh, no, look at my fags!

02:40.520 --> 02:42.062
Where?

02:42.770 --> 02:44.353
I'll get them, I'll get them!

02:44.520 --> 02:47.187
No! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

02:47.853 --> 02:49.478
I'm so sorry.

02:49.978 --> 02:51.437
It's so cold.

02:52.145 --> 02:53.395
What the fuck?

03:00.978 --> 03:04.062
MUM: GET THERE OK? XX

03:05.395 --> 03:06.478
TARA: X

03:06.478 --> 03:08.145
Ah, fuck's sake!

03:08.353 --> 03:10.312
Set me a fag. Mine are fucked.

03:10.728 --> 03:13.228
I swear my mum would've called
on the plane if she could have.

03:13.228 --> 03:15.728
I'm not sure
Mum's even clocked we've left.

03:17.687 --> 03:19.478
This is all we have
between all of us?

03:19.645 --> 03:22.103
- Yeah, just one.
- This is it to get dry?

03:23.353 --> 03:26.228
- Guys, I'm fucking starving.
- I swear you're always hungry.

03:26.853 --> 03:29.062
Why is the sea so cold?

03:29.770 --> 03:32.103
You know we still got
loads of time to kill?

03:32.520 --> 03:34.228
Do you wanna get chips?

03:34.728 --> 03:36.645
- Yes, 100%.
- Chips! Chips! Chips!

03:36.770 --> 03:40.020
- I want a big fucking big portion.
- Large! Large, large, extra-large.

03:41.312 --> 03:43.353
Oh, excuse me.

03:43.687 --> 03:45.228
Sorry, um...

03:45.353 --> 03:47.937
I was just wondering if maybe
we could have a room with, like, a...

03:47.937 --> 03:49.145
like, a pool view?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.770
Pool view?
No, no, no.

03:52.312 --> 03:54.770
All gone. I'm sorry.

03:55.103 --> 03:56.645
OK. Um...

03:58.020 --> 04:00.103
I tried.
Apparently, they're all gone.

04:01.395 --> 04:02.853
Hi!

04:03.812 --> 04:05.812
- Hi.
- Um, my name's Tara.

04:05.937 --> 04:07.478
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:07.478 --> 04:10.145
Um, so, the thing is...
I just spat, sorry.

04:10.270 --> 04:13.270
Um, the thing is,
we're going to need pool view,

04:13.520 --> 04:16.228
because... see our friend Skye there?

04:16.437 --> 04:18.145
She can't swim very well,

04:18.145 --> 04:20.728
so we need to, like,
keep eyes on her at all times.

04:20.728 --> 04:23.270
- Like, we have to see her.
- We can be lifeguards.

04:23.270 --> 04:25.228
We can just dive in
if anything happens.

04:25.228 --> 04:27.353
We're excellent swimmers,
like, really good.

04:27.353 --> 04:29.853
- Save you guys the trouble.
- I actually swim for the county.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.937
We were hoping
we could use this holiday

04:31.937 --> 04:33.395
to help teach her...

04:33.395 --> 04:34.770
to doggy-paddle.

04:34.770 --> 04:36.937
- All right, all right.
- Thanks.

04:45.437 --> 04:49.562
Oh, my God! This is insane!

04:49.687 --> 04:51.062
Oh, my God!

04:51.187 --> 04:52.478
Look at this swan!

04:52.603 --> 04:54.937
- I fucking love the curtains.
- He left us swans.

04:55.145 --> 04:57.603
- Taz...
- Oh, babe, stunning!

04:58.062 --> 05:00.520
Outfit number one sorted!
Outfit number...

05:00.645 --> 05:04.937
Oh, there's butterflies
everywhere as well!

05:04.937 --> 05:07.478
Um... Skye! What are you doing?

05:07.728 --> 05:09.228
What are you doing?

05:09.353 --> 05:12.770
- Deep-fried fags.
- You're a nutter!

05:12.895 --> 05:15.353
- But I will have one, thank you. OK.
- They are already dry.

05:15.478 --> 05:17.895
- We got our own fridge!
- Fucking luxury.

05:18.228 --> 05:21.270
This room is huge!
Like, a whole room.

05:21.687 --> 05:22.978
Where? Let's see.

05:23.645 --> 05:26.020
Ey! Pool view!

05:27.020 --> 05:28.728
Let me see!

05:29.812 --> 05:33.312
Best view I've ever seen in my life!
Whoo!

05:41.728 --> 05:43.478
Ooh! Whoo!

05:44.062 --> 05:46.145
Sorry about that,
but I needed my doughnut.

05:46.353 --> 05:47.645
Breakfast!

05:48.187 --> 05:49.603
Breakfast!

05:50.020 --> 05:51.395
And... breakfast!

05:51.603 --> 05:52.853
Dinner one!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.728
- Shit! Sorry.
- Can you not?

05:56.395 --> 05:59.228
Oi, whoever gets laid the most wins this.

05:59.687 --> 06:01.062
Apple punch for sex?

06:01.187 --> 06:02.853
- No. No, no, no.
- Actually...

06:04.270 --> 06:05.353
This.

06:06.603 --> 06:08.187
Titty glasses.

06:08.853 --> 06:11.228
What do we get if we're sick the most?

06:11.228 --> 06:12.645
Um, nothing,

06:12.978 --> 06:15.353
because we're not
going to plan for that, you nutter.

06:15.353 --> 06:16.978
All right. All right.

06:16.978 --> 06:18.853
Bonus prize.

06:18.853 --> 06:20.437
Party girl!

06:21.853 --> 06:24.562
Guys, I've been thinking,

06:25.062 --> 06:27.853
whoever's getting laid the most,
they should kinda get the main room.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.228
Yeah.

06:29.228 --> 06:30.770
And everyone else

06:31.562 --> 06:33.645
just kinda sleep where they land.

06:34.520 --> 06:37.645
Me, I'm going to be refraining
from sleep this holiday.

06:37.770 --> 06:40.145
Don't lie! You're going to be, like,
asleep in the club.

06:41.437 --> 06:43.145
Oi, you look beaut!

06:44.520 --> 06:45.853
Come here, try this.

06:51.103 --> 06:53.437
You should just go out like that.

06:53.895 --> 06:55.687
Like this?

07:00.520 --> 07:03.312
You look banging
no matter what you wear.

07:03.312 --> 07:04.978
Can I borrow some of that lip gloss?

07:05.103 --> 07:06.770
Yeah, let me do it for you.

07:13.853 --> 07:15.312
Look at you.

07:15.437 --> 07:17.978
If you don't get laid on this holiday
then you never will.

07:18.103 --> 07:20.770
No, I can't die a virgin!

07:21.228 --> 07:23.437
HOW TO HAVE SEX

07:34.812 --> 07:36.395
69!

07:37.228 --> 07:38.228
Fuck!

07:42.645 --> 07:44.353
Wait, wait, wait, we're not ready.

07:45.728 --> 07:47.020
Oi! Oi!

07:48.937 --> 07:50.520
Whereabouts you all from?

07:50.645 --> 07:52.312
We don't have any change.

07:53.853 --> 07:55.812
What, am I homeless or something?

07:58.228 --> 08:00.020
<i>♪ Call me</i>

08:00.687 --> 08:03.353
<i>♪ Call me by my name</i>

08:03.687 --> 08:07.978

08:08.187 --> 08:10.395

Oh, my God!

08:35.603 --> 08:38.312
Not like that! Give it here!

08:38.645 --> 08:40.228
Oh, oh.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.853
- I'm too thirsty. Hmm.
- Tara.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.020
I'm going to be sick.

08:46.020 --> 08:49.520
Night one in the Big Brother house,
Em is sick.

08:50.270 --> 08:53.353
Fuck! She's actually going to be sick.

08:53.478 --> 08:55.353
Hold the microphone.

08:59.937 --> 09:03.520
<i>♪ I am the one and only ♪</i>

09:03.853 --> 09:05.437
Can we have three more shots, please?

09:08.228 --> 09:09.437
I love you, Taz.

09:09.437 --> 09:11.103
I love you, too.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.312
Besties for life, yeah?

09:16.437 --> 09:18.937
I've just been to the bar and got shots.

09:18.937 --> 09:20.687
Check it out.

09:20.895 --> 09:22.437
No, no, no.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.687
Yes!

09:46.687 --> 09:49.853
Oi, what happens
if I fail every exam?

09:50.020 --> 09:52.187
Fuck school!
Let's all just find jobs together.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.770
Oi.

09:54.187 --> 09:56.228
You're fucking smart.

09:57.312 --> 09:58.937
I'm actually going to fail.

09:58.937 --> 10:01.478
Taz, even if you failed everything,

10:01.853 --> 10:03.603
you could talk your way in.

10:04.603 --> 10:06.312
- Tara!
- I need a wee.

10:06.437 --> 10:09.437
Chips are technically vegetables,
aren't they?

10:10.645 --> 10:12.603
Skye, is it my night to throw up yet?

10:12.728 --> 10:15.228
You already threw up.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.937
Don't laugh at me!

10:26.020 --> 10:27.062
Tara!

10:27.062 --> 10:29.145
What happens if I go to this good school

10:29.145 --> 10:31.770
and then no one even likes me
when I get there?

10:31.770 --> 10:34.853
Oh, Em, that's silly.
Don't think like that.

10:34.978 --> 10:36.228
No one likes you anyway.

10:36.353 --> 10:38.478
Why do you think
we ended up with you?

10:40.395 --> 10:44.270
- I'm joking.
- Here come on babe! Babe, babe! Babe!

10:44.395 --> 10:46.312
It's, like, a win-win situation.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.228
Either you fail
and you stay with us wasters,

10:49.812 --> 10:51.187
- or...
- I don't wanna fail!

10:51.187 --> 10:52.937
Or you get in and then you're really rich

10:52.937 --> 10:54.812
and you can bring us
on holiday every year.

10:54.937 --> 10:56.103
Vets aren't rich.

10:56.103 --> 10:58.103
They don't have loads
and loads of money.

10:58.353 --> 11:02.062
Yeah, but you're just, like,
really smart. You always have been.

11:02.853 --> 11:05.062
I can't even do a backflip.

11:05.853 --> 11:09.228
Thing is, I don't know what I wanna do.

11:09.645 --> 11:11.562
- I think...
- I wanna do a backflip.

11:11.687 --> 11:14.978
I think maybe I'll just do business,
'cause everything is business now.

11:15.103 --> 11:17.103
Every day, like, just all the time.

11:17.228 --> 11:18.978
We got to go
into business together.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.437
I heard that as well.

11:20.562 --> 11:23.395
Oh, my God!
These cheesy chips, man!

11:23.603 --> 11:25.937
- What?
- Ow!

11:27.103 --> 11:29.062
Oi, I am actually going to
open my own restaurant

11:29.062 --> 11:30.895
and just serve cheesy chips.

11:31.520 --> 11:35.395
Oi, you can come and work for me
while Em fucks off to finish school.

11:37.687 --> 11:39.687
I'll come.
I'll go every single day.

11:39.687 --> 11:41.437
- I think...
- I'll come three times.

11:41.437 --> 11:43.312
- I think we should...
- Breakfast and dinner.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.312
I think we should go to bed now.

11:45.437 --> 11:48.145
All I need to do to go to good school

11:48.145 --> 11:51.145
is if I get lots of As. Say As in...

11:51.312 --> 11:52.937
Em!

11:53.520 --> 11:56.853
- Shut up! You're stressing me out.
- Oi! The thing is, though...

11:58.270 --> 12:00.812
- ...is that...
- I'll hold it in that hand.

12:01.062 --> 12:03.520
...is that you two are actually
my best mates.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.603
- Gang, gang, gang.
- Gang, gang, gang.

13:46.895 --> 13:49.020
All right? I'm Paige.
Nice to meet you, ladies.

13:49.145 --> 13:51.312
- My name's Paddy.
- Nice to meet you.

14:03.187 --> 14:04.187
Whoo!

14:06.895 --> 14:08.895
Oi, I thought you left me for dead
with this clown.

14:08.895 --> 14:09.770
Oi!

14:09.770 --> 14:11.145
You know, I love youse a lot,

14:11.270 --> 14:14.270
but none of us are going to get laid
if we just hang out with each other.

14:14.478 --> 14:15.937
Last night was a disaster.

14:16.062 --> 14:17.103
Come on, then.

14:21.020 --> 14:24.187
Everyone in the entire hotel
must be having a shower right now.

14:24.562 --> 14:27.478
Oi, Taz, you should wear this.
You'd look so sexy in it.

14:27.728 --> 14:29.312
Don't you think, Em?

14:30.020 --> 14:32.812
I don't know,
looks mad uncomfortable to me.

14:34.812 --> 14:36.520
Skye, is this yours?

14:37.062 --> 14:39.395
- Yeah, why?
- Can I borrow it?

14:39.395 --> 14:40.895
Do you know
what you're doing with it?

14:40.895 --> 14:43.187
- Yeah, it's just...
- Come on, I'll show you.

14:56.687 --> 15:00.062
No my, my robot
is actually sick, though.

15:00.187 --> 15:02.020
Oh, my God!

15:02.687 --> 15:04.978
You look insane! What the fuck?

15:05.103 --> 15:08.520
Yeah, OK, I kinda get,
you look incredible.

15:09.020 --> 15:12.520
- Ah, she's ready to go out!
- Whoo!

15:42.478 --> 15:43.562
Yo!

15:44.478 --> 15:45.853
Sexy!

15:48.937 --> 15:50.645
Oi, smoke show!

15:54.353 --> 15:56.478
I know you can hear me.
I can see you smiling.

16:07.395 --> 16:09.228
You lot going out later?

16:10.770 --> 16:12.812
You should come round here for pres.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.353
Yeah, I can ask the girls.

16:17.520 --> 16:20.645
Fucking hell!
Talk about selective hearing.

16:22.728 --> 16:24.145
What's your name?

16:24.687 --> 16:25.812
Tara.

16:26.020 --> 16:27.687
That's a nice name, innit?

16:28.770 --> 16:29.895
I'm Badger.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.895
That's a bit of a weird name, innit?

16:34.520 --> 16:35.937
It's my nickname.

16:37.937 --> 16:39.020
Who's this?

16:40.353 --> 16:43.145
Romeo, Romeo, where is you? Yeah.

16:43.728 --> 16:45.478
Room 341, yeah?

16:45.812 --> 16:47.603
All right, easy, Tiger.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.312
We only just met.

16:53.187 --> 16:55.812
- Oi, no, what the fuck is that?
- What?

16:56.437 --> 16:57.437
Ohh...!

16:57.437 --> 16:58.853
- Who's done that?
- I did it.

16:58.978 --> 17:01.895
They're fucking ridiculous,
like two massive slugs on your face.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.687
Wait, how old
do you think they are, though?

17:04.812 --> 17:08.145
Oi, guys, remember your phone
and keys and money.

17:08.270 --> 17:11.270
I think, maybe, like, 19, 21.

17:11.478 --> 17:13.895
Yeah, so, what are we going to say?
We're, like, 18?

17:14.062 --> 17:16.478
You guys just going to fall in love
and leave me to it again?

17:16.478 --> 17:18.978
I think, like, 18,
just finished college, yeah?

17:19.312 --> 17:21.978
- Yeah, obviously I drive a BMW.
- Ha! You wish!

17:22.103 --> 17:24.853
- All right, come on, Taz!
- I think I'm doing a degree

17:24.853 --> 17:26.645
to be the next Prime Minister.

17:27.145 --> 17:29.645
Bro, if you can tell me
who the current Prime Minister is,

17:29.770 --> 17:31.978
then I'll consider
you taking his job, yeah?

17:31.978 --> 17:33.270
Go on.

17:33.270 --> 17:35.853
All right, for fuck's sake,
just come on! Shut up!

17:35.978 --> 17:37.603
Does this actually look all right?

17:39.020 --> 17:41.062
- Mad uncomfortable, innit?
- Yeah.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.187
You look fit as fuck, though!

17:43.520 --> 17:45.520
- So do you, mate.
- Quick.

17:46.645 --> 17:49.312
- Taz, your phone, I said!
- Yeah, give it, then.

17:49.312 --> 17:50.812
- I need my bag.
- Keys!

17:50.812 --> 17:53.228
Taz, you have got
to sort those eyebrows out.

17:53.853 --> 17:55.270
Paddy, your go.

17:55.395 --> 17:57.395
Nah, it's Paige's go.

17:57.603 --> 18:01.437
Never have I ever crashed a quad
into a parked car.

18:01.562 --> 18:04.062
Badger this morning
still pissed out his head.

18:04.437 --> 18:06.020
I'm usually a sick driver.

18:06.228 --> 18:08.312
I fucking drive vans for a living.
It's me job.

18:08.312 --> 18:10.478
You don't crash them into parked cars
at work, though, do you?

18:11.645 --> 18:15.603
Never have I ever had a threesome.

18:24.062 --> 18:26.520
- Get shots out.
- Yeah, let's get some shots.

18:26.728 --> 18:28.187
There's one.

18:31.687 --> 18:33.062
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:01.687 --> 19:03.895
Spin, spin.
Faster, faster, faster, go on.

19:04.228 --> 19:06.437
Three, two, one...

19:06.603 --> 19:07.978
Stop! Stop!

19:08.978 --> 19:11.562
Oi, no, spillage is lickage, it's fine.

19:11.562 --> 19:14.020
- Go on, Em!
- That is disgusting.

19:14.145 --> 19:15.937
What you doing?

19:16.062 --> 19:17.312
- No, no, no, no...
- Yeah!

19:17.312 --> 19:18.770
I saw that. That was cheating.

19:20.187 --> 19:23.228
Do you know where the vet's are?
'Cause I got two swans that are sick.

19:31.645 --> 19:34.062
Never have I ever had sex.

19:34.562 --> 19:36.687
Fucking hell!
Come off it, we're not 12.

19:39.895 --> 19:42.728
Never have I ever slept
with two birds in one night.

19:43.062 --> 19:45.437
I'm not drinking that
'cause I'm a fucking saint.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.187
- Oi.
- Chill out.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.270
What happens on holiday
stays on holiday!

19:54.270 --> 19:56.353
- What are you doing?
- I was only joking, babe.

19:56.478 --> 19:58.228
I wasn't going to call you out, obviously.

19:58.228 --> 19:59.395
Yeah, sure!

19:59.395 --> 20:01.895
No one cares if you're a virgin,
it's very chill.

20:01.895 --> 20:04.437
So, why are you bringing it up, then?

20:05.978 --> 20:07.312
'Cause it's funny.

20:08.395 --> 20:09.937
It's not funny.

20:09.937 --> 20:12.228
Skye, it's not funny.

20:12.520 --> 20:13.853
Got a drink?

20:14.645 --> 20:16.770
Paddy is fit, though!

20:17.187 --> 20:18.853
You should try it with him.

20:19.562 --> 20:20.895
Or I might.

20:20.895 --> 20:22.062
Oh!

20:25.603 --> 20:26.603
Oi!

20:38.520 --> 20:40.020
Whoo!

20:45.770 --> 20:48.187
Oi, matchy-matchy, night bossman.

20:49.728 --> 20:52.437
Top graft on these lot,
they're about as cool as your sister.

20:52.437 --> 20:54.270
Chill out, mush,
we're on holiday!

20:54.270 --> 20:55.312
What's the matter?

20:55.312 --> 20:57.187
Did you hear?
They're talking about us.

20:57.187 --> 20:59.145
We need to, like,
not let on our age at all.

20:59.270 --> 21:00.687
- To them.
- Yeah.

21:00.687 --> 21:03.353
Ooh, I miss my BMW so much!

21:03.853 --> 21:05.270
Subtle!

21:06.520 --> 21:07.770
Listen. Listen.

21:07.895 --> 21:09.687
Do you think Paige is gay?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.603
Are you joking?

21:12.728 --> 21:14.728
- J... I don't know.
- Are you joking?

21:14.728 --> 21:16.728
- Are you telling a joke?
- Let's hope she's gay.

21:16.728 --> 21:18.145
Of course she's gay.

21:19.353 --> 21:20.562
Oooh!

21:23.062 --> 21:24.228
I saved that!

21:24.853 --> 21:27.228
- Tipped it straight over.
- Don't lie. That went right in.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.812
- Fuck off!
- That's cheating.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.228
- Right, come on.
- Look at you sat down.

21:32.478 --> 21:33.728
- Come on.
- No!

21:33.728 --> 21:34.895
What the fuck!

21:35.020 --> 21:36.228
Let's go.

21:45.728 --> 21:47.187
Come on, get it down you.

21:47.187 --> 21:48.603
Come on Badger.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.978
Uh, ah, Malia!

22:19.812 --> 22:21.770
Oi! Paddy! Move.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.520
I'm in a bad way!

22:39.437 --> 22:40.895
...two, three!

22:43.312 --> 22:44.937
Feeling any better?

22:45.687 --> 22:47.187
No.

22:48.228 --> 22:49.520
I think I can help.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.103
Um...

22:51.270 --> 22:54.020
So, I sold my hoover
the other day, yeah?

22:54.312 --> 22:55.312
Yeah.

22:55.437 --> 22:58.062
'Cause all it was doing
was collecting dust.

23:02.103 --> 23:05.437
Think! I got more, I got more.

23:05.562 --> 23:10.770
What is the difference
between a plum and a rabbit?

23:12.353 --> 23:13.812
I don't know.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.645
One is purple, and one isn't...

23:17.645 --> 23:19.978
- Oh, wait! No, I got it wrong.
- Oh!

23:20.145 --> 23:22.062
I got it wrong.

23:22.937 --> 23:24.603
No, no, no...

23:24.770 --> 23:26.437
You're good.

23:26.562 --> 23:28.978
I don't think you've got
anything else left, to be honest.

23:34.353 --> 23:38.353
Why... Why do you never see
pigs hiding in trees?

23:40.895 --> 23:42.978
'Cause they're pretty good at it.

24:27.853 --> 24:29.478
Oi, what's that?

24:30.645 --> 24:33.687
Nah! Nah...!
You little cheating bastard.

24:33.853 --> 24:37.395
No, that's a classic one.
I'm going, I'm going.

24:41.478 --> 24:42.770
Shh...

24:55.562 --> 24:56.812
Nah.

24:57.645 --> 24:58.978
Bedtime.

25:27.437 --> 25:30.228
Come on, girls.
Up you get, you beautiful lot.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.687
Buses for Crush in five. Let's go.

25:32.687 --> 25:34.603
Oi! Hurry up! Crush is happening!

25:34.812 --> 25:35.895
Let's go!

25:35.895 --> 25:38.103
See you at gate in five!

25:38.395 --> 25:39.687
No.

25:39.812 --> 25:41.645
Surely, we have more
than five minutes, no?

25:41.978 --> 25:43.687
Why are we doing this to ourselves?

25:43.687 --> 25:46.353
No, if it's started,
we got to get a move on.

25:46.478 --> 25:48.645
We can be a bit late.

25:51.770 --> 25:53.062
Oh, my God.

25:53.062 --> 25:55.062
- Come on.
- Look at the state of him.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.937
See you in a bit, yeah?
Come Badger.

26:06.645 --> 26:08.145
I didn't bring any.

26:08.145 --> 26:10.062
Oi! Put this on.

26:11.562 --> 26:13.187
What did he just say?

26:13.187 --> 26:15.103
He's so fit.

26:18.187 --> 26:19.770
Everything hurts.

26:19.895 --> 26:23.603
I think that with this...

26:23.728 --> 26:26.312
- Skye, how does this work?
- Underneath.

26:26.437 --> 26:28.228
You need to cover your bits.

26:30.478 --> 26:33.770
I swear to God,
you guys need to get some life!

26:35.520 --> 26:38.353
The only way through this for me
is with another drink.

26:38.478 --> 26:41.228
- No!
- What's that called? Dog of hair?

26:41.353 --> 26:43.228
- Dog of hair!
- Hair of dog.

26:43.353 --> 26:46.228
- That's a thing.
- Yeah, my mum does it all the time.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.062
See? It's proper.

26:48.187 --> 26:50.437
I'm not fucking dressing you.
I'm not your mum.

26:50.437 --> 26:52.437
- Thanks, mum.
- Where's the hair straighteners?

26:52.437 --> 26:55.103
No, wait, Skye,
I need something else on with it.

26:55.228 --> 26:56.853
- What? What?
- It's see-through.

26:56.978 --> 26:58.228
It's not that see-through!

26:58.353 --> 27:00.937
In the water it will be.
I thought this is a pool party.

27:01.187 --> 27:04.020
Right come on orange!
Come on, that's it.

27:04.020 --> 27:07.395
Come on, girls!
Let's get it down you!

27:07.728 --> 27:09.645
Use those double-Ds!

27:09.770 --> 27:12.353
How are they not choking on that?

27:14.270 --> 27:16.520
That's it, girls!
Double-Ds, babes!

27:17.312 --> 27:18.937
We have a winner!
Well done, babes.

27:19.103 --> 27:20.687
Well done Sir, that's fantastic.

27:20.978 --> 27:22.270
One more girl! Anyone!

27:23.187 --> 27:25.770
- Taz! Taz!
- No, Skye.

27:25.895 --> 27:27.270
We've got one here! Taz!

27:29.062 --> 27:30.603
In the green, yeah? Come on!

27:30.728 --> 27:33.395
Come on, baby girl,
you got this one, you got this!

27:33.395 --> 27:36.645
One brave boy to play the game.

27:36.853 --> 27:39.312
Hey, here we go.
Look at him, he's eager.

27:39.437 --> 27:41.228
- You all right, bruv? Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:41.353 --> 27:43.228
Right, up there you pop.
Go on, son.

27:43.437 --> 27:45.895
Go on, Taz. Whoo!

27:46.687 --> 27:48.187
- Oh!
- Hello, little flower.

27:48.312 --> 27:49.395
How are you?

27:49.395 --> 27:50.603
- You okay?
- Yeah.

27:50.770 --> 27:52.895
- Who've we got?
- I'm Tara.

27:53.020 --> 27:54.270
Hello, Tara!

27:54.437 --> 27:55.978
You know what this kind of game is?

27:55.978 --> 27:58.645
- I guess so.
- It's a bit naughty. Are you sure?

27:58.645 --> 28:01.228
All right, he's got a big fake willy,
that looks like a beer,

28:01.228 --> 28:02.895
and you're going to drink it.

28:03.062 --> 28:04.187
Right, ready?

28:04.187 --> 28:07.395
Beer in the mouth, blowjob-style.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

28:08.312 --> 28:11.728
That's it, that's it!
Go on, get back in there!

28:12.187 --> 28:13.603
That's it! Not in her eyes.

28:14.645 --> 28:17.437
That's it. More, more, more, more.
Go on, keep going. Push it. Push it!

28:17.687 --> 28:20.603
Put your back into it, mate.
That's it, that's it, that's it!

28:20.812 --> 28:22.270
Keep going, keep going!

28:22.395 --> 28:24.937
Get in there!
That's it, that's it, that's it!

28:25.103 --> 28:28.103
Come on, open your mouth more,
Jesus Christ!

28:28.270 --> 28:30.270
No boy's going to be happy with you!

28:30.395 --> 28:31.853
Christ!

28:32.103 --> 28:33.395
Tragic. I love you though.

28:33.728 --> 28:35.687
Yeah, I'm not good at that game.

28:35.812 --> 28:37.437
I dunno, you look pretty good to me.

28:37.562 --> 28:39.937
- Come on, guys! All right!
- Another one?

28:40.062 --> 28:41.645
- That's enough.
- That's enough.

28:41.645 --> 28:43.103
Off, off! You lost.

28:43.895 --> 28:45.437
You lost, girl!

28:45.437 --> 28:47.353
You can cuddle
in your own time.

28:47.353 --> 28:50.020
- Right, we need another boy!
- One more boy, please.

28:52.353 --> 28:54.020
Come on!

28:55.728 --> 28:57.520
You had a good time, yeah?

28:57.645 --> 29:00.562
Let me see those hands up! Yeah?

29:00.687 --> 29:03.228
If you've got a drink in your hands,
down it!

29:03.353 --> 29:06.062
Go! Now! Go, go, go! Down it!

29:06.062 --> 29:07.312
Beautiful, I like that.

29:09.395 --> 29:11.270
Who else is fucked?

29:11.478 --> 29:12.978
Where are you?

29:22.353 --> 29:24.020
Wait, it's fine.

29:25.853 --> 29:27.728
It's still fine. It still works.

29:32.062 --> 29:33.770
No, no! Stop it!

29:35.478 --> 29:36.812
Aah, get off me.

29:37.937 --> 29:40.353
Don't you think he's kinda fit, yeah?

29:43.270 --> 29:45.812
I mean, he's a complete clown, no?

29:47.812 --> 29:50.145
No, but a sexy clown.

29:50.437 --> 29:52.812
Come on, I think he's proper jokes.

29:53.853 --> 29:55.437
Nah, he's butters.

29:57.562 --> 29:59.062
You can do much better.

30:01.895 --> 30:03.062
Come on.

30:36.978 --> 30:38.103

31:01.978 --> 31:04.103

31:05.520 --> 31:08.187

So fucking ready!

31:14.645 --> 31:16.603
Let's fucking have it Malia!
Come one guys.

31:16.603 --> 31:18.270
Sorry, I just stepped on you.

31:18.270 --> 31:19.770
We're drunk.
We're fucking drunk.

31:19.770 --> 31:22.312
OK, we're going to play a game.
We're going to play a last game.

31:22.312 --> 31:23.603
Final game of the night, yeah?

31:23.603 --> 31:25.145
- It's a mad one.
- It's a big one.

31:25.145 --> 31:26.853
You got to give it your all, okay?
What do we need?

31:26.853 --> 31:28.770

- If you do it with me.

31:28.770 --> 31:29.895
Yeah, OK.

31:31.312 --> 31:32.853
OK, let's do this...

31:34.062 --> 31:35.270
Come on.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.728
One more, right?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.103
Final!
It's the fucking final, guys.

31:39.103 --> 31:42.270
Get your game faces on.
Stretch it out! Ready?

31:42.478 --> 31:44.562
We need two boys
up on this stage now.

31:44.562 --> 31:45.687
Get me two boys!

31:45.687 --> 31:48.228
- Who've we got? Hands up!
- So many hands!

31:48.228 --> 31:50.520
I can't hear you.

31:50.645 --> 31:51.687
Who's wants it?

31:51.812 --> 31:53.228
Oi, oi, look who it is.

31:53.353 --> 31:56.312
Yes, let's have our loser from
earlier back, come on, in the blue.

31:56.437 --> 31:58.562
Let's get you up.
Prove yourself this time.

31:59.937 --> 32:01.687
Let's go!

32:04.395 --> 32:05.978
Yeah!

32:06.312 --> 32:08.478

32:08.478 --> 32:09.603

32:10.103 --> 32:11.478
Badger!

32:12.478 --> 32:14.437
Over here we got Badger!

32:15.353 --> 32:18.187
Badger! Badger! Badger!

32:18.312 --> 32:19.937
What's your name, boy?

32:20.062 --> 32:21.937
My name's Tom

32:21.937 --> 32:23.770
Tom from fucking London, yeah!

32:23.770 --> 32:25.145
We love a Londoner!

32:27.645 --> 32:30.228
Oi! Now, listen up,
the game we are playing

32:30.228 --> 32:35.187

32:36.270 --> 32:38.770
- We need some girls!
- We need some fucking girls.

32:45.145 --> 32:47.478
- Come on...
- Oh, no.

32:47.603 --> 32:50.353
Oh, this one's a lucky boy, eh?

32:50.937 --> 32:53.853
Three girls over here.
That's it, over here! That's it.

32:53.978 --> 32:56.520
That is amazing technique.
How are you not hard?

32:57.770 --> 32:59.853
Ooh, Jesus Christ, she's gagging.

33:00.395 --> 33:02.437
Come on, Badger,
go to your happy place, mate.

33:02.562 --> 33:04.603
Go on, girls! That's it!

33:05.020 --> 33:06.937
That's it! Oh, my God!

33:07.062 --> 33:10.270
Yeah! My fucking boy!

33:13.228 --> 33:15.020
Let's go, darling.
Go on, deep-throat him.

33:15.145 --> 33:17.353
Yes! Yes!

33:17.687 --> 33:19.770
What are we saying?
What are we fucking saying?

33:21.687 --> 33:23.395
Yes, yes, yes! He's hard!
Badger is hard!

33:38.895 --> 33:39.895
Oh.

34:02.187 --> 34:03.270
Skye?

34:04.895 --> 34:06.145
Yeah.

34:06.853 --> 34:08.687
Is that bed free yet?

34:15.228 --> 34:16.645
Yeah, mate.

34:17.062 --> 34:18.520
Go on.

34:18.645 --> 34:20.562
And take the pan with you, innit?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.520
Oh fuck!

34:26.145 --> 34:27.187
Thanks.

34:37.270 --> 34:38.437
Yo!

34:38.562 --> 34:41.770
You've got a big smirk on your face.
Have you got something to tell us?

34:41.978 --> 34:42.978
Go on!

34:42.978 --> 34:45.353
Go on, get in there!
He just got a second.

34:45.478 --> 34:46.812
Shh!

34:47.145 --> 34:48.395
Please, Badger.

34:48.562 --> 34:51.103
I wondered when youse lot would surface.

34:51.228 --> 34:52.603
Morning.

34:55.937 --> 34:57.645
Not feeling too good, lass?

34:58.520 --> 35:00.895
Get some brekkie down ya,
round two starting soon.

35:02.145 --> 35:04.395
Fucking hell, you're really in
for the worst, aren't you?

35:04.520 --> 35:07.728
I thought you southern fairies knew
how to party, you fucking jokers.

35:08.103 --> 35:10.478
Don't feel very jokes right now.

35:21.103 --> 35:22.645
Gorgeous, pet!

35:27.270 --> 35:28.395
Fuck!

35:29.687 --> 35:31.728
Why so early?

35:32.728 --> 35:34.645
I don't remember anything at all.

35:36.395 --> 35:37.937
Is Taz at theirs?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.478
Must be.

35:44.145 --> 35:45.270
Hm.

35:53.895 --> 35:56.270
Eating's cheating, babe.

35:58.145 --> 35:59.770
Oh, my God, please stop.

35:59.895 --> 36:01.812
You're going to make me sick again.

36:02.770 --> 36:04.478
What, you want some?

36:07.478 --> 36:09.520
Oi, do us a favour
and wake Tara up.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.562
Me and her have got
some unfinished business.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.853
We all know how you finish
your business now, Badger.

36:15.895 --> 36:17.353
You lot up for pool?

36:18.270 --> 36:19.937
- Yeah.
- Em?

36:20.437 --> 36:22.228
- Yeah.
- Worst bit is, yeah,

36:22.353 --> 36:23.603
I've got no memory of it.

36:24.437 --> 36:27.353
Probably the greatest thing to ever
happen to me in my whole entire life.

36:27.353 --> 36:28.812
No memory.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.270
That was the best thing?

36:31.645 --> 36:33.395
Hopefully,
them girls feel the same.

36:33.395 --> 36:35.145
Yeah, I hope
they don't remember it either.

36:36.145 --> 36:38.395
Your life sounds proper shit.

36:39.187 --> 36:40.395
Rinsed.

36:40.520 --> 36:42.353
Oi! Last night
were crazy, you know?

36:42.478 --> 36:44.437
Taz, come out here! Mush!

36:44.437 --> 36:46.937
Stop screaming, you lunatic.

36:47.562 --> 36:49.312
Well, if you won't get her
out here...

36:50.645 --> 36:52.228
She's with you, no?

36:52.228 --> 36:53.853
Yeah! Ain't she at yours?

36:53.853 --> 36:55.687
No, why would she be here?

36:56.478 --> 36:58.062
Well, she came back with you.

36:58.853 --> 37:00.645
She not at yours?

37:01.228 --> 37:03.978
He's joking about.
Just bring her out.

37:04.270 --> 37:06.353
On my Mum's life, I'm not joking.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.687
Check your phone.

37:13.520 --> 37:15.145
She would've said something.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.520
This is typical Tara behaviour.

37:20.145 --> 37:21.770
She's always on one.

37:25.520 --> 37:27.770
See, last seen in the apartment, now.

37:33.770 --> 37:35.228
Damn!

37:35.562 --> 37:37.228
I guess girl got laid.

37:41.437 --> 37:43.978
What she doing
leaving her phone here?

37:45.728 --> 37:47.770
- Why are you being weird?
- I'm not.

37:50.645 --> 37:53.728
- Oi, just look proper, yeah?
- Yeah, check.

37:53.728 --> 37:55.562
Mate, I'd know if she came here.

37:55.812 --> 37:57.603
She's definitely still on it.

38:07.145 --> 38:08.770
I don't like it.

38:09.395 --> 38:10.812
Just chill out.

38:12.437 --> 38:15.812
It's nothing major, is it?
Just fucking stop panicking.

38:16.020 --> 38:18.062
Should have moved quicker, bro.

38:18.853 --> 38:21.228
Don't you get jealous, you.
It doesn't suit you.

38:24.895 --> 38:26.978
What are you trying to get at?

38:30.562 --> 38:31.978
Where is she, then?

38:32.228 --> 38:34.228
- You chat shit.
- I don't know.

38:35.395 --> 38:38.020
I can't just sit here.
I'm going to talk to reception, okay?

38:45.687 --> 38:47.437
See you down the pool, yeah?

38:47.437 --> 38:49.228
Come on, boys, let's go.

38:49.812 --> 38:51.187
Badger, you coming?

38:58.353 --> 38:59.687
Oi!

39:08.603 --> 39:10.437
Do you want to come and chill here?

39:38.187 --> 39:40.312
I'm so proud of Tara, man.

39:43.645 --> 39:44.978
Proud?

39:48.937 --> 39:50.895
I bet she's finally...

39:55.228 --> 39:57.145
She's wanted to for so long.

40:00.395 --> 40:02.103
What are you on about?

40:07.145 --> 40:09.187
She's a massive virgin, mate.

40:23.895 --> 40:25.603
Do you think she's all right?

40:27.187 --> 40:29.437
Mate, she's having
the time of her life.

40:37.062 --> 40:38.645
Are you jealous?

40:40.603 --> 40:43.062
No, it's...
it's not that, it's just...

40:47.770 --> 40:49.937
Well, we could go looking for her.

40:51.145 --> 40:53.020
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.

41:13.937 --> 41:15.687
Ho, ho, this one's a lucky boy, eh?

41:18.103 --> 41:19.312
Let's go darling!

41:19.312 --> 41:20.770
Go on, deep throat him.

41:21.687 --> 41:23.062
Jesus Christ, she's gagging.

41:25.937 --> 41:26.978
Hi darling.

41:48.562 --> 41:49.978
All right, you?

41:49.978 --> 41:51.645
- Paddy!
- What are you doing?

41:51.645 --> 41:53.937
Um... not going home.

41:54.437 --> 41:56.562
Is it past your bedtime already?

41:57.562 --> 41:59.103
Where's everyone else?

41:59.853 --> 42:01.395
Still going, I think.

42:01.395 --> 42:03.937
Yeah? Oh, come on,
you can't go to bed.

42:03.937 --> 42:06.437
Me and you are always
last ones standing.

42:06.812 --> 42:09.062
You're not going leave me
on my own, are you?

42:11.478 --> 42:12.895
We go to beach?

42:14.895 --> 42:17.103
Come on! I know you want to.

42:18.228 --> 42:19.895
Come on!

42:26.270 --> 42:28.270
- Sit there.
- Here?

42:33.895 --> 42:35.937
You don't fancy the strip, then, no?

42:35.937 --> 42:37.937
- No.
- Why?

42:38.895 --> 42:40.437
I don't know.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.687
Don't you think it's mad how, like,

42:46.437 --> 42:48.353
sand just gets everywhere?

42:48.895 --> 42:50.395
No, we're on a beach.

42:51.853 --> 42:53.312
What are you on about?

42:53.312 --> 42:56.520
Yeah but, it just gets everywhere.

43:05.895 --> 43:08.770
I've not noticed it before,
but you're proper beautiful, you know?

43:15.978 --> 43:19.645
Some kind of compliment
in there somewhere.

43:21.853 --> 43:23.853
You're into our lad, though,
aren't you?

43:29.645 --> 43:31.645
So, what are you into, then?

43:35.062 --> 43:36.145
Hmm...

43:37.603 --> 43:40.603
Pasta and cheesy chips.

43:42.103 --> 43:44.187
You're fucking jokes, you!

43:53.645 --> 43:55.770
Oi, let's go skinny dipping.

43:55.937 --> 43:57.103
- No.
- Why?

43:57.270 --> 43:59.062
- 'Cause it's so cold.
- Come on! Come on!

43:59.062 --> 44:00.895
Paddy, no! No!

44:01.103 --> 44:03.853
Paddy, no! I don't want to!
Put me down!

44:03.853 --> 44:05.853
Paddy! No!

44:06.062 --> 44:08.645
No! Put me down!

44:10.270 --> 44:13.020
- It's all right once you're in it!
- It's not, alright at all Paddy.

44:13.020 --> 44:14.228
It's fucking freezing!

44:14.645 --> 44:16.270
Come here.

44:17.270 --> 44:18.353
Come here.

44:22.187 --> 44:24.145
You're going to lose all your teeth.

44:26.228 --> 44:27.645
Come here.

44:31.020 --> 44:33.103
What you laughing at?

44:35.478 --> 44:37.187
Paddy, stop!

44:37.312 --> 44:39.395
- What?
- Stop.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.187
All right, I won't touch you.

44:51.895 --> 44:53.770
No!

44:54.103 --> 44:55.478
- Come here.
- What?

44:55.687 --> 44:56.978
I'm cold!

44:59.478 --> 45:02.437
I think it's a bit unfair how it don't
work both ways, though, really.

45:02.562 --> 45:04.270
I'm cold.

45:07.437 --> 45:08.895
Come on, then.

45:22.103 --> 45:23.895
Weren't me, boss!

45:24.520 --> 45:25.895
What?

45:26.187 --> 45:28.853
I can't help it when it's wiggling
in front of me like that, can I?

45:30.353 --> 45:31.978
What are you so uptight for?

45:32.145 --> 45:33.437
I'm not.

45:34.270 --> 45:36.145
I thought you were the fun one.

45:36.895 --> 45:38.770
- Are you cold?
- Yes.

45:39.728 --> 45:41.020
Come on.

45:42.187 --> 45:43.812
Wet clothes make you colder.

45:57.603 --> 46:00.312
Chill out, it's not like
I'm asking you to marry me, is it?

46:01.770 --> 46:04.645
What do you mean,
this isn't the wedding?

46:16.853 --> 46:18.145
Yeah?

46:26.853 --> 46:28.270
Yeah?

46:31.228 --> 46:32.728
Yeah.

48:34.062 --> 48:36.103
What's your name?

48:36.103 --> 48:37.562
Tara.

48:38.478 --> 48:39.687
What's yours?

48:40.062 --> 48:41.353
I'm Fi.

48:42.520 --> 48:45.687
- Oi, you lot, this is Tara.
- Tara!

49:03.728 --> 49:05.603
Are you okay?

49:06.353 --> 49:07.937
Yeah, sorry.

49:08.520 --> 49:10.312
Where's your mates at?

49:11.728 --> 49:12.978
Um.

49:12.978 --> 49:14.687

50:49.020 --> 50:50.978
You can sleep on the sofa,
I can go in with Josh.

50:51.103 --> 50:52.937
No, no, no.

50:53.062 --> 50:55.187
I'm just going to have a quick nap,

50:55.312 --> 50:57.103
and then, then I'll be fine.

50:57.603 --> 50:59.312
- That's not happening.
- It's fine.

50:59.478 --> 51:00.812
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:00.937 --> 51:04.312
So, like, are you and Josh

51:04.812 --> 51:08.437
No, no, no, no, we're, like,

51:12.187 --> 51:13.312

51:13.437 --> 51:16.062
Well, at least just stay inside.
Everyone's, like, proper sound.

51:16.062 --> 51:20.562
No, I know, everyone is so nice,
but I'm... this is good for me.

51:21.062 --> 51:24.228
All right, fine. Okay, but you know
where we are if you need us.

51:24.770 --> 51:25.895
Thank you.

51:25.895 --> 51:28.187
- Night!
- Good night.

53:13.895 --> 53:15.187
Guess who's back!

53:15.187 --> 53:16.395
Hey!

53:16.520 --> 53:19.978

53:20.895 --> 53:22.062
Snap!

53:22.062 --> 53:24.020
Right, right, right.
That's one that you've won.

53:24.020 --> 53:25.187
Yeah, alright...

53:25.187 --> 53:26.687
You must have...

53:28.145 --> 53:29.145
Snap!

53:31.520 --> 53:33.187
Come on, details!

53:33.187 --> 53:34.687
You were going to say?

53:34.812 --> 53:37.478
It was a sick night.

53:58.937 --> 54:00.853
So, did you and Paige...?

54:01.312 --> 54:04.062
No, we were going to
this afternoon, but...

54:04.312 --> 54:05.770
I don't know, I think...

54:05.895 --> 54:08.145
I think she's kind of nervous,
you know?

54:09.270 --> 54:11.228
Don't change the subject.

54:11.645 --> 54:13.312
Where've you been?

54:13.895 --> 54:15.937
You know, I was really freaking out.

54:16.312 --> 54:18.562
And, what,
you left your phone here, too.

54:21.645 --> 54:23.103
Taz.

54:25.520 --> 54:29.228
I, I slept with Paddy.

54:32.103 --> 54:34.062
No fucking way!

54:37.895 --> 54:40.145
When? How did that happen?

54:41.020 --> 54:42.603
On the beach.

54:43.187 --> 54:44.978
Oh, on the beach!

54:47.395 --> 54:49.187
Sounds really romantic.

54:50.062 --> 54:51.520
No.

54:51.812 --> 54:53.312
Was it good?

54:53.520 --> 54:54.812
Um...

54:58.437 --> 55:02.145
And then I met
these absolute legends in a club,

55:02.270 --> 55:06.353
danced for hours,
and then went back to their villa.

55:06.478 --> 55:09.145
And it was really mental,
but they were really cool, so...

55:10.103 --> 55:11.312
I was there all night.

55:11.520 --> 55:13.520
So, what did I miss?

55:13.728 --> 55:15.020
Who was it?

55:17.603 --> 55:19.812
Oh, you're proper sneaky,
you know?

55:21.062 --> 55:22.562
All of this,
we got to stick together,

55:22.687 --> 55:24.437
have each other's back,
blah-blah-blah.

55:24.562 --> 55:27.020
Runs off, has sex and gets new mates.

55:27.312 --> 55:28.687
Who was it?

55:30.520 --> 55:31.853
Paddy.

55:32.937 --> 55:34.395
Oh my God!

55:36.937 --> 55:39.103
Holiday romance brewing!

55:39.437 --> 55:40.437
No.

55:40.562 --> 55:43.437
Don't you think it's weird that
he hasn't said anything to youse?

55:43.603 --> 55:45.645
No.

55:46.478 --> 55:48.520

55:49.645 --> 55:52.437

55:52.728 --> 55:54.728
There's much to be celebrating,

55:57.520 --> 56:00.395

56:00.395 --> 56:02.728

57:01.603 --> 57:02.978
Mm, no.

57:15.395 --> 57:17.312
Guys, Mum's just text.

57:17.728 --> 57:19.812

57:21.478 --> 57:22.895
Oh my God.

57:26.353 --> 57:29.145

57:29.312 --> 57:31.103

Yeah, come on,

59:48.353 --> 59:49.937

- So well!
- Wait, you looked?

01:00:14.187 --> 01:00:16.353
Yeah. Taz, I persuaded her, innit?

01:00:16.978 --> 01:00:19.812
I thought you said
you weren't going to check results.

01:00:19.937 --> 01:00:23.062
She might even be able
to come with me next year.

01:00:26.562 --> 01:00:28.103
Don't be sad, Taz.

01:00:28.103 --> 01:00:29.937
Whatever you do,
you're going to be great.

01:00:30.062 --> 01:00:32.645
When are we going?

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.020

01:00:52.603 --> 01:00:55.353
We got to keep an eye on Em tonight.
She's already looking fucked.

01:00:55.478 --> 01:00:58.103
We're not going to babysit her, though.

01:00:58.228 --> 01:01:01.103
Like, it's results night,
she's worked for it.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.937
Pretty sure you don't need ten As
to open a restaurant anyway.

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.437
I'll get you on front desk.

01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:10.103
What restaurant have you been to
what has a front desk?

01:01:10.228 --> 01:01:12.812
Two coats? Any bags?
Yeah, that's four pounds!

01:01:12.937 --> 01:01:15.812
That's not front desk,
that's a cloakroom!

01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:18.353
I'm not going to be working
on a cloakroom.

01:01:18.603 --> 01:01:21.187
Yeah, I'm not sure you've got
much choice at this point.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:27.937
Nah, come on.

01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:30.145
I'm joking.

01:01:32.603 --> 01:01:35.062
I would be kinda jokes
in a cloakroom, though.

01:01:40.145 --> 01:01:42.187
So what, is Paddy good, then?

01:01:46.353 --> 01:01:47.770
Yeah, I guess.

01:01:48.770 --> 01:01:51.145
Like, he knew
what he was doing, innit?

01:01:53.562 --> 01:01:55.270
Yeah, he looks like it.

01:01:57.812 --> 01:01:59.270
Did he, like...

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.353
pick you up and throw you
about and that?

01:02:03.978 --> 01:02:05.395
Kind of.

01:02:06.728 --> 01:02:08.603
Like, he's strong.

01:02:11.478 --> 01:02:14.187
Then you should deffo go
for round two with him.

01:02:25.312 --> 01:02:26.978
- That's yours.
- Thanks.

01:02:27.728 --> 01:02:31.103
All right, you two,
save it for the bedroom.

01:02:32.562 --> 01:02:34.062
You all right?

01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:35.603
Yeah, you all right?

01:02:39.812 --> 01:02:42.687
Sorry about last night.
I was trashed.

01:02:43.645 --> 01:02:45.270
What do you mean?

01:02:49.228 --> 01:02:50.728
It's fine.

01:03:16.437 --> 01:03:18.020
Fuck...

01:03:20.645 --> 01:03:21.895
Fucking, yeah...

01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:33.978
<i>It's giving me a migraine.</i>

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:36.478
<i>Come on then, let's have a shot.</i>

01:03:36.478 --> 01:03:38.853
<i>No, I don't want vodka,
I just want a shot. Go on.</i>

01:05:42.895 --> 01:05:44.103
Oi oi!

01:05:44.812 --> 01:05:47.353
Where the fuck
have you been all night?

01:05:51.562 --> 01:05:53.353
We're going skinny dipping.

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:57.645
At the hotel?

01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:59.478
No, at the beach.

01:06:00.562 --> 01:06:01.978
I'm good.

01:06:02.812 --> 01:06:05.978
Come on! It's your last night here.
Stop being a little weirdo.

01:06:06.895 --> 01:06:09.103
I don't wanna get sand everywhere.

01:06:09.645 --> 01:06:11.645
It's just fucking sand!

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:14.978
I'm all right.

01:06:16.145 --> 01:06:17.812
Stop being a freak, Taz.

01:06:20.145 --> 01:06:21.187
Okay.

01:06:22.645 --> 01:06:25.062
Tara come on, I'm only joking.

01:06:29.562 --> 01:06:31.145
Oi, come Badger.

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.562
No. I'd better walk her back.

01:06:35.603 --> 01:06:37.020
Fuck!

01:06:45.145 --> 01:06:46.270
Oh ho!

01:06:48.353 --> 01:06:50.103
What you doing, bro?

01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:51.978
Going down t' beach?
Everyone's there.

01:06:51.978 --> 01:06:53.520
Yeah, of course.

01:06:55.228 --> 01:06:57.187
Come on. Paddy's coming.

01:06:59.895 --> 01:07:01.437
She loves it on t' beach, her.

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:05.603
Come.

01:07:10.187 --> 01:07:11.770
I'll come and find you later on.

01:07:45.395 --> 01:07:47.062

01:07:56.353 --> 01:07:57.353
Cuppa?

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:02.812
Yeah, sure.

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:09.103
What would you rather be,
a baby goat or a mata baby?

01:08:10.978 --> 01:08:12.853
What's a mata baby?

01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:15.562
I don't know baby,
what's the matter with you?

01:08:24.937 --> 01:08:26.770
Do you want any sugar?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:28.895
Uh-huh.

01:11:12.187 --> 01:11:14.937

01:11:23.062 --> 01:11:25.937
- What time is it?
- We didn't come here to sleep.

01:11:26.062 --> 01:11:27.562
We bought you a present.

01:11:28.478 --> 01:11:30.353
- Got a dead weight!
- Sort her out.

01:11:30.728 --> 01:11:32.853
Wake up, you lazybones.

01:11:33.437 --> 01:11:35.812
- You're not even asleep.
- Come on!

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.853

- Party! Party! Party!

01:11:38.978 --> 01:11:42.312

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.645
Hi.

01:11:58.395 --> 01:12:00.020

I just came to say hi.

01:12:19.228 --> 01:12:20.520

01:12:28.020 --> 01:12:29.312
What are you doing?

01:12:29.603 --> 01:12:31.187
Sleeping here.

01:12:44.145 --> 01:12:45.770
Did you not like it?

01:12:52.728 --> 01:12:54.937
Yo, I've got a drink
for you here, bro.

01:12:55.103 --> 01:12:56.812
I'm all right, me, bro.

01:12:57.437 --> 01:13:00.562
I'm good. I'm going to go to bed, me,
I'm pretty tired.

01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.312
I'm a taken man now, aren't I?

01:13:22.895 --> 01:13:24.728
What are you wearing?

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.895
Get these off you, you'll be red hot.

01:13:46.812 --> 01:13:48.520
Everyone's here, Paddy,
and I'm asleep.

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.228
All right, all right.

01:13:52.312 --> 01:13:53.937
<i>Taz?</i>

01:13:56.937 --> 01:13:58.187
<i>Tara?</i>

01:13:58.395 --> 01:13:59.853
Yeah, Em?

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.520
<i>Love you.</i>

01:14:04.728 --> 01:14:06.270
I love you, too, mate.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.478
You all right?

01:14:10.853 --> 01:14:12.020
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:13.687
<i>I am,</i>

01:14:14.312 --> 01:14:16.353
<i>but I'm a bit pissed, though, mate.</i>

01:14:17.562 --> 01:14:20.312
<i>I think I'm really going to
miss you next year.</i>

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:22.978
<i>Are we still going to hang out?</i>

01:14:23.478 --> 01:14:25.145
Yeah, mate, we will.

01:14:25.812 --> 01:14:27.895
<i>We'll be best friends for life.</i>

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.353
Hm.

01:14:53.562 --> 01:14:55.687
Don't move. Let me do it.

01:15:00.395 --> 01:15:02.187
Am I too fast?

01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:04.353
You like it fast, don't you?

01:15:04.853 --> 01:15:06.520
<i>My neck is killing me...</i>

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.562
<i>Let us in the bed, for fuck's sake.</i>

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:16.020
That floor is fucking rough,
mate, my neck's fucked.

01:15:24.812 --> 01:15:26.645
Told you you would.

01:15:28.978 --> 01:15:30.728
I love you, mate.

01:15:33.228 --> 01:15:35.437
Best holiday ever.

01:16:34.603 --> 01:16:36.562
Probably won't go out tonight.

01:16:40.645 --> 01:16:42.645
Went a bit hard, innit?

01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:58.687
You can't pretend you can't hear me.

01:16:59.187 --> 01:17:01.020
I made it onto your balcony now.

01:17:02.312 --> 01:17:04.228
Yeah, sorry, I'm just tired.

01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.228
Wake up legends!

01:17:10.228 --> 01:17:12.937
Mission complete! On t' next one!

01:17:13.187 --> 01:17:14.603
Round...

01:17:15.145 --> 01:17:17.062
Fucking what round is it?

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.603
Morning, gorgeous. All right?

01:17:25.562 --> 01:17:27.145
What you saying?

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.270
Nothing, I'm chilling, bro.

01:17:34.145 --> 01:17:36.020
Fucking hell! Good chat lads!

01:17:51.353 --> 01:17:53.395
He's a nightmare of a guy.

01:17:55.312 --> 01:17:56.687
Mm...

01:18:06.145 --> 01:18:07.853
I've known him since I were little.

01:18:09.812 --> 01:18:13.062
His mum and my mum,
they're best mates.

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:22.145
And we live on the same street.

01:18:24.187 --> 01:18:25.812
That's nice.

01:18:50.312 --> 01:18:51.687
See you back home.

01:18:51.812 --> 01:18:53.978
Yeah, we'll come down.
It'll be well jokes.

01:18:54.103 --> 01:18:55.603
Yeah, or we'll come up.

01:18:55.728 --> 01:18:57.228
See how you northern lot do it.

01:18:57.228 --> 01:18:59.270
Anyway, we're all
coming back next year.

01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:01.353
Same time, same place, no excuses.

01:19:01.353 --> 01:19:03.062
Yeah, no excuses.

01:19:03.270 --> 01:19:04.812
No early bedtimes either, Taz.

01:19:04.937 --> 01:19:06.187
Call her, then, innit.

01:19:06.187 --> 01:19:07.937
Make sure you text me
when you get home.

01:19:07.937 --> 01:19:09.562
You gave Paddy your number, yeah?

01:19:09.562 --> 01:19:10.937
See you later.

01:19:14.978 --> 01:19:16.187
- Bye.
- See ya.

01:19:16.187 --> 01:19:17.853
See you gorgeous!

01:21:22.395 --> 01:21:24.478
Uh, I'm going to get
some munch from here.

01:21:25.728 --> 01:21:27.062
What do youse want?

01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:29.437
- Chips if they have them.
- Yeah, chips also.

01:21:30.562 --> 01:21:31.853
Banging.

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:37.145
Give us all the details then.

01:21:37.562 --> 01:21:39.687
There's not really anything to add to it.

01:21:44.062 --> 01:21:46.228
I reckon we'll come back next year.

01:21:52.312 --> 01:21:54.312
Oi, you did it again last night, innit?

01:22:00.062 --> 01:22:01.562
I swear!

01:22:03.145 --> 01:22:05.937
Oh, was it better
the second time, yeah?

01:22:12.478 --> 01:22:14.603
Why are you being sheepish?

01:22:14.728 --> 01:22:16.478
Come on, give us the details.

01:22:16.687 --> 01:22:18.062
No.

01:22:18.228 --> 01:22:20.437
It didn't count.
It weren't really proper.

01:22:20.437 --> 01:22:23.103
- How can it not be proper?
- Here.

01:22:25.645 --> 01:22:26.853
What are you pair saying?

01:22:26.978 --> 01:22:28.853
Just saying about last night.

01:22:28.853 --> 01:22:30.853
Taz is saying it didn't count.

01:22:32.395 --> 01:22:33.687
He's fit.

01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:35.187
In my opinion, anyway.

01:22:36.062 --> 01:22:37.353
I would have.

01:22:39.728 --> 01:22:41.145
Yeah, he is fit.

01:22:41.645 --> 01:22:43.978
Who'd have thought
you two would get laid the most?

01:22:47.978 --> 01:22:49.728
Yeah, I don't know, he's just...

01:22:50.228 --> 01:22:51.687
a weird guy, innit?

01:22:52.062 --> 01:22:53.728
What do you mean,
he's a weird guy?

01:22:53.728 --> 01:22:55.062
Forget him!

01:22:56.395 --> 01:22:58.687
We're going out
as soon as we get home, yeah?

01:22:59.062 --> 01:23:01.312
We got local man to get on, now!

01:23:01.687 --> 01:23:03.812
Huh! Fuck Paddy, man!

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.895
You can do so much better.

01:23:14.937 --> 01:23:16.353
Taz?

01:23:21.145 --> 01:23:22.520
I like, I was...

01:23:25.145 --> 01:23:26.687
asleep, so...

01:23:33.103 --> 01:23:34.520
Are you saying...?

01:23:38.312 --> 01:23:40.687
What, Taz, was he like that
with you both nights?

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:53.562
It's fine.

01:23:58.562 --> 01:24:00.270
You should've said something, like.

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:02.312
I didn't clock, I...

01:24:05.062 --> 01:24:06.395
Taz...

01:24:07.395 --> 01:24:09.937
No, you're right, I should've,
I should've said something.

01:24:12.103 --> 01:24:13.353
It's fine.

01:24:18.812 --> 01:24:20.020
No, it's not.

01:24:20.645 --> 01:24:23.062
We should buy stuff here.
It's much cheaper.

01:24:23.437 --> 01:24:26.020
I didn't even get a tattoo
or anything on this holiday.

01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:28.645
You were busy.

01:24:32.562 --> 01:24:34.145
Oi, smell that.

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:37.562
- It's banging, that.
- Mm.

01:24:37.562 --> 01:24:39.645
- <i>...to London, Luton.</i>
- Yeah.

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:41.978
Fuck! You guys know
this is our plane boarding, innit?

01:24:42.687 --> 01:24:43.728
Come on!

01:24:43.728 --> 01:24:46.395
<i>...the gate will be closing
in five minutes. Final call...</i>

01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:48.687
Go! Go! Go! Go...

01:25:03.937 --> 01:25:05.270
We got this.

01:25:11.937 --> 01:25:13.937
We're coming home!
