WEBVTT

00:14.347 --> 00:17.934
They said they'd like to broadcast it.
You know, the demonstration.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.394
Pardon?

00:20.854 --> 00:22.939
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.149
What did they say again?

00:24.232 --> 00:25.775
They said they'd pay me.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.902
They'd like to do a live broadcast

00:29.779 --> 00:31.114
of the moment I go to Hell.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.034
Those crazy freaks!

00:39.998 --> 00:41.541
So what did you say to them?

00:42.751 --> 00:43.877
Well…

00:44.711 --> 00:47.047
that young chairman said

00:48.089 --> 00:50.258
he'd pay me three billion won
if I agreed to it.

00:50.341 --> 00:51.342
The thing is,

00:51.426 --> 00:55.638
I don't know how I can safely receive
such a huge amount of money.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.266
Ms. Min,

00:59.601 --> 01:03.104
I don't know if that decree thing
is real or not,

01:03.188 --> 01:04.856
but I really need your help

01:04.939 --> 01:06.357
so that I can receive…

01:08.026 --> 01:11.571
I mean, so that my kids
can receive that money.

01:15.992 --> 01:20.121
I understand, ma'am, but you
shouldn't rush into accepting the offer.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.125
Agreeing to the broadcast
can expose the identities

01:24.209 --> 01:27.170
of not only yourself,
but also of your whole family, and--

01:27.253 --> 01:28.797
What if it's real?

01:30.131 --> 01:33.718
How are my children going to live
if I really die a few days later?

01:35.386 --> 01:37.430
My son did a lot of research

01:37.514 --> 01:40.100
and suggested I come see you
because you'd handle it best,

01:40.183 --> 01:42.352
but I'll find someone else
if you can't help me.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.856
No, you've come to the right person.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.818
Whatever the New Truth
bastards are scheming,

01:49.901 --> 01:52.654
it's better to let them do it
in plain sight.

01:52.737 --> 01:53.738
Don't worry.

01:54.364 --> 01:58.368
Mr. Park,
can I see you outside for a minute?

02:01.287 --> 02:03.206
Excuse us, ma'am.

02:07.836 --> 02:08.878
What's wrong?

02:08.962 --> 02:13.049
Are you really going to let her
go on the live broadcast?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.971
Do you seriously think those monsters
will come and get her five days from now?

02:18.054 --> 02:20.390
I don't think it will ever happen.

02:21.307 --> 02:25.603
This is a great opportunity to show
that the New Truth is a total fraud.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.857
Moreover, Ms. Park has nothing to lose.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.944
They'll only embarrass themselves
and hand over three billion won.

02:34.571 --> 02:37.574
What if they really do show up?

02:40.660 --> 02:41.995
No matter what…

02:44.164 --> 02:46.124
it's better for her to receive that money.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.419
It sounds like the kids
will be on their own.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.466
Let's report it to the police.

02:56.718 --> 03:01.764
I'll try and come up with a way
to keep her children out of this.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.600
I'll tell her we'll take the case.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.442
We've come to an agreement.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.569
I can't even imagine
how you feel right now.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.739
We'll help you. Don't worry.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.908
Thank you.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.535
She never listens to me.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.506
My goodness! I can't believe you!

04:16.589 --> 04:18.633
Mom, are you out of your mind?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.177
Did you forget that you have cancer?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.262
You said you quit!

04:22.345 --> 04:25.348
That was when I was healthy.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.352
If anyone complains, tell them you're
burning incense sticks for my altar.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.647
What kind of sick joke is that?

04:33.314 --> 04:36.109
Why are you so cranky today?

04:37.360 --> 04:40.822
Is that novelist in serious condition?

04:40.905 --> 04:42.156
Not really.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.662
I feel like the world
I used to know is falling apart.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.915
What do you mean?

04:51.499 --> 04:54.085
It's just that a lot of strange things
have been happening lately.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.170
Like what?

04:59.382 --> 05:00.425
Well…

05:02.427 --> 05:04.554
they say something strange appears

05:05.930 --> 05:08.850
and prophesizes your death.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.229
Then it takes you to Hell
on the prophesized date.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.029
I've seen that "something strange"
you're talking about.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.698
What?

05:24.532 --> 05:27.952
I saw it on the day
I was diagnosed with cancer.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.954
It was my doctor.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.084
Mom.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.046
Aren't you scared?

05:41.215 --> 05:45.136
Everyone dies at some point.

05:46.846 --> 05:51.309
I'm just glad that I can die
without losing myself.

05:51.934 --> 05:53.728
It's a relief.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.149
The fact that I am looking
at my daughter's face right now…

05:59.776 --> 06:00.777
is also a relief.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.346
Happy birthday to you

06:28.429 --> 06:32.225
Happy birthday, dear Mom

06:32.308 --> 06:35.395
Happy birthday to you

06:38.606 --> 06:40.358
Mom, look.

06:41.567 --> 06:47.615
Park Jungja.
You will die five days from now,

06:47.698 --> 06:50.493
at 3:00 p.m.

06:53.329 --> 06:54.705
-Hello?
-Hello?

06:54.789 --> 06:57.834
-You have the wrong number.
-Then, file a petition first.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.002
-Is that the forensic report?
-Yes.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.588
That's not our jurisdiction.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.674
-We don't know either.
-Hey, just hang up.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.175
What?

07:06.843 --> 07:07.844
The Arrowhead?

07:09.345 --> 07:10.179
I mean…

07:11.180 --> 07:13.766
Even if they are minors,
they were caught in the act,

07:13.850 --> 07:15.476
and their addresses are unknown.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.438
By the way, how did you get this number?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.899
This is considered obstruction of justice!

07:23.109 --> 07:25.069
When did I ever threaten you?

07:25.153 --> 07:26.237
Hello?

07:28.239 --> 07:30.324
How did they even get my personal number?

07:30.408 --> 07:32.493
Everyone turn off your phones.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.578
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.330
-Is that the report? Give it to me.
-Yes, sir.

07:41.085 --> 07:41.961
What is this?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.713
It's not organic matter?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.716
Apparently, the burnt body
we thought was the victim

07:47.550 --> 07:48.926
is not of a living organism.

07:49.719 --> 07:51.888
It's something
that doesn't exist in this world.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.306
What nonsense is that?

07:53.806 --> 07:55.892
Then what the hell is it supposed to be?

07:55.975 --> 07:58.311
A man died in broad daylight,

07:58.394 --> 08:01.898
and there were dozens of witnesses.
How can it not be a living organism?

08:01.981 --> 08:02.815
Then what is it?

08:02.899 --> 08:05.735
You all saw it yourselves.
You saw the victim running for his life.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.988
How am I supposed to report this
to my superior?

08:13.201 --> 08:14.827
LAWYER MIN HYEJIN

08:14.911 --> 08:17.038
-Hello?
-Hey, Kyunghun!

08:18.915 --> 08:19.749
Yes.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.459
What?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.045
Chairman Jung.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.672
This neighborhood isn't that expensive.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.342
It won't be difficult
to get the landlords to agree to it.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.887
Since we're here,
why don't we get consent from them today?

08:32.970 --> 08:36.098
-How does that sound?
-Sounds good. No one will refuse it.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.893
Chairman Jung, nice to see you again.

08:41.062 --> 08:41.979
Hello.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.941
I guess you got a call from the lawyers.

08:45.024 --> 08:48.110
A death threat has been made,
so the police should be on it.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.405
Is there any reason
we should stay out of it?

08:52.448 --> 08:53.616
Of course not.

08:54.116 --> 08:56.661
It's better to get more people involved.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.454
But…

08:59.038 --> 09:01.874
I didn't know the New Truth
had so much money.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.129
We have very diverse members.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.466
And some of them
have amassed great wealth.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.678
But did you say "death threat"?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.641
We see these cases
as one of those pre-announced murders.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.897
Detectives who are after God's decree…

09:26.732 --> 09:28.526
Sounds mythological.

09:29.694 --> 09:30.778
Detective.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.574
In the ancient world,

09:35.199 --> 09:38.411
people believed that solar eclipses
were a sign of God's wrath.

09:40.079 --> 09:44.333
They thought a heavenly dog
took a bite of the sun.

09:45.876 --> 09:51.716
That's why they sent hunters
on a mission to catch that dog.

09:53.467 --> 09:54.594
That's interesting.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.014
Detectives.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.434
Don't you think

10:02.268 --> 10:03.811
you are like those hunters?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.523
Isn't it better to be a hunter

10:08.649 --> 10:13.571
rather than a priest who persecutes
the innocent using God as an excuse?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.574
You must be Ms. Min Hyejin.

10:18.075 --> 10:19.994
Let's go in. We have a lot to go over.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.246
Please arrange a meeting
with the landlords.

10:22.330 --> 10:23.289
Yes, sir.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.125
Do you have all the documents ready?

10:26.208 --> 10:27.084
Yes.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.253
Let's hurry back to the office and call…

10:29.337 --> 10:30.546
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.926
After you.

10:36.594 --> 10:37.595
Thank you.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.821
I'm sorry. This is all I have to offer.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.240
-Don't be. This is more than enough.
-Here you go.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.493
Are the kids at school?

11:00.576 --> 11:03.829
I told them to stay in their room.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.832
I was wondering if we could meet them.

11:06.916 --> 11:07.750
Why?

11:07.833 --> 11:10.252
Never mind.
It's better that they stay home.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.004
-Thank you for this.
-Enjoy.

11:15.883 --> 11:18.219
We should talk to the kids
since they are witnesses.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.970
We have the footage on the phone.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.515
-Leave the kids out of it.
-Please have some.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.060
Thank you.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.233
What are you doing, Eunyul?

11:32.316 --> 11:35.319
Mom told you to help me color this.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.779
Be quiet.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.489
Is all the information correct?

11:38.572 --> 11:40.282
Let me remind you

11:40.366 --> 11:42.910
that the identities of the children
must not be exposed.

11:42.993 --> 11:45.746
Same goes for Ms. Park
until the day of the live broadcast.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.581
We wouldn't stoop that low.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.876
You don't need to worry about that.

11:52.378 --> 11:56.549
Even if the broadcast gets canceled,
you still need to pay her the rest.

11:56.632 --> 11:59.885
Can we get a discount
if the broadcast gets canceled?

12:03.264 --> 12:06.225
It's already been settled in writing.

12:07.810 --> 12:08.894
I'm sorry.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.440
I'm not used to this kind of meeting,

12:13.357 --> 12:15.359
so I made a joke to break the ice.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.945
We'll agree to any conditions

12:18.028 --> 12:22.032
as long as Ms. Park
will be here on the day.

12:22.533 --> 12:24.744
-Okay.
-I'm not well versed in law.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.705
Our head of legal will take care of it.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.706
Will do, sir.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.751
-We've looked over everything.
-Okay.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.969
How old are your children?

12:43.637 --> 12:46.223
They are 13 and 6.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.018
I see. The age gap is quite big.

12:49.727 --> 12:55.149
-I guess he must be the one who filmed it.
-Yes.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.317
Is he not home?

12:57.026 --> 12:59.111
I told him to stay in his room
with his sister.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.781
Chairman Jung, the money has been wired.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.115
Please check the account.

13:05.785 --> 13:09.497
Here. Please check the account number
and the amount.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.167
They are correct.

13:17.379 --> 13:20.424
It would be nice if I could meet the kids.

13:21.509 --> 13:25.262
But I don't see the father
in any of the pictures.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.517
They don't have a father.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.354
How can they not have a father?
How is that possible?

13:35.356 --> 13:36.816
I'm a single mother.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.818
The kids don't have the same father, so…

13:38.901 --> 13:42.154
Ma'am, you don't need to answer
all his questions.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.781
-Especially something like that.
-Okay.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.366
I'm curious to know

13:46.909 --> 13:48.994
how you ended up giving birth…

13:51.580 --> 13:54.375
to not just one,
but two kids without fathers.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.382
I wonder what their fathers were like.

14:05.553 --> 14:07.972
Could they have been married men?

14:08.514 --> 14:10.057
Excuse me.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.185
Why are you curious about that?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.980
Because I have to know the reason.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.607
What reason are you talking about?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.609
Isn't it obvious?

14:24.113 --> 14:27.658
The reason Ms. Park
is bound for Hell.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.451
What?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.037
Is this how you work?

14:34.331 --> 14:36.000
What did my mom do wrong?

14:36.083 --> 14:37.334
Eunyul, go back to your room.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.003
What did she do to deserve to go to Hell?

14:39.086 --> 14:40.671
-You don't even know my mom.
-Calm down.

14:40.754 --> 14:44.216
If you do, then figure out and tell us
what she did to deserve to go to Hell.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.593
Go inside with your sister.

14:45.676 --> 14:48.304
No! You did nothing wrong!

14:48.387 --> 14:50.681
Go back to your room!

14:52.850 --> 14:54.560
Can't you see the adults are talking?

14:55.227 --> 14:56.228
Behave yourself!

14:57.229 --> 14:58.480
Stay here with your sister.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.784
Chairman Jung,

15:12.536 --> 15:14.622
you can say whatever my sin is.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.124
All I want

15:17.625 --> 15:21.211
is to secure a better future
for my children.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.258
Ms. Min, we are all good
with the contract, right?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.929
It's the best thing
that has ever happened to me.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.100
I've never been able
to provide much for my kids.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.395
This is a great opportunity for me.

15:40.064 --> 15:45.027
Please help my kids settle down
somewhere where no one will find them.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.490
I beg you.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.052
Chairman Jung.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.680
The meeting with the landlords
has been arranged.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.473
-Okay.
-Let's head there now.

16:15.599 --> 16:16.642
Ms. Min.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.020
About the priest you mentioned earlier…

16:20.104 --> 16:23.857
Don't you think a priest is supposed
to endow people's lives with meaning?

16:24.817 --> 16:28.821
Humans are doomed to destroy themselves
when they can't find meaning.

16:31.949 --> 16:33.701
A new world is coming soon.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.911
I'll see you there.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.130
That crazy bastard.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.800
Does he seriously believe
something's going to happen?

16:50.718 --> 16:54.304
Not a single channel
will agree to broadcast this nonsense.

16:54.388 --> 16:57.141
Only those Arrowhead freaks
will watch it online,

16:57.224 --> 16:58.934
praying for something to happen.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.896
Well, what do you plan
to do with the kids?

17:02.980 --> 17:06.483
I'm going to send them
to my cousin in Canada in two days.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.236
-Okay.
-They can come back if nothing happens.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.989
Or Ms. Park can follow them there.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.158
Why would they move to Canada?

17:14.241 --> 17:15.951
The broadcast will get canceled,

17:16.035 --> 17:18.454
and all the hype the Arrowhead
built up will be gone.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.291
Ms. Park is right. Of course, she's
fortunate to receive that much money.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.292
Don't you think?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.596
It's a huge surprise!

17:35.679 --> 17:38.432
A special announcement from the New Truth!

17:38.515 --> 17:41.226
The New Truth is finally doing their job.

17:41.310 --> 17:47.191
There is someone who received
a decree to go to Hell here in Korea.

17:47.274 --> 17:50.235
What's more surprising

17:51.111 --> 17:55.449
is that they will broadcast
the demonstration live!

17:57.493 --> 17:59.661
Remember what we had to go through?

18:00.245 --> 18:02.331
Just because we were enlightened,

18:02.414 --> 18:05.751
we have been misunderstood,
despised, and insulted.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.336
But now…

18:08.420 --> 18:09.755
in two days,

18:10.422 --> 18:14.843
the whole world
will start listening to us.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.181
We've endured pain and hardship,
and now it's paying off!

18:19.264 --> 18:21.350
-Rejoice, everyone!
-He looks like you.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.020
I'm so happy! I can't wait!

18:25.104 --> 18:28.690
But why isn't the New Truth
disclosing who the sinner is

18:28.774 --> 18:33.862
and what the sinner did
to deserve to go to Hell?

18:44.998 --> 18:48.418
CONFORMIST38 HAS ENTERED THE CHAT

18:53.048 --> 18:55.884
CONFORMIST38: RECIPIENT PARK JUNGJA,
SON PARK EUNYUL, DAUGHTER PARK HAYUL

18:55.968 --> 18:57.886
SINGLE MOTHER,
DIFFERENT BIOLOGICAL FATHERS

19:00.889 --> 19:02.099
Conformist38!

19:02.683 --> 19:03.642
Who the fuck are you?

19:03.725 --> 19:05.269
You blessed bastard!

19:05.352 --> 19:07.312
This information is sick!

19:07.396 --> 19:11.233
The Arrowhead!

19:11.316 --> 19:14.611
-The Arrowhead! The Arrowhead!
-It's a woman called Park Jungja!

19:14.695 --> 19:16.572
The Arrowhead!

19:16.655 --> 19:19.992
The Arrowhead!

19:36.383 --> 19:37.217
Heejung.

19:40.637 --> 19:41.763
Heejung.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.852
Damn. Where is she?

19:53.192 --> 19:54.026
Hello?

19:54.818 --> 19:55.861
Hey.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.696
Where are you at this hour?

19:57.779 --> 19:58.739
Well…

19:59.448 --> 20:00.616
I'm at my friend's.

20:00.699 --> 20:04.036
We're pulling an all-nighter for a test.
I'll go to school from here.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.871
Is that okay?

20:06.538 --> 20:07.748
What friend?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.625
A friend you don't know.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.044
Why? Should I come home?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.546
No, it's fine.

20:15.255 --> 20:17.883
Don't stay up all night.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.760
Make sure you get some sleep.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.222
Dad.

20:23.722 --> 20:24.681
Yes?

20:26.266 --> 20:27.559
Thank you.

20:28.810 --> 20:31.271
Oh, okay.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.190
All right, then.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.001
Was that your father?

20:53.085 --> 20:53.919
Yes.

20:54.878 --> 20:57.798
I saw your father earlier today.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.800
Thank you.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.723
Thank you, Heejung,

21:08.225 --> 21:09.685
for making up your mind.

21:12.604 --> 21:14.398
I made up my mind six years ago.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.110
My mom…

21:20.696 --> 21:22.990
She died because of me.

21:23.615 --> 21:24.533
Sorry?

21:26.493 --> 21:27.619
That day…

21:28.954 --> 21:33.250
she asked me to stop by my dad's work
to bring him a change of clothes.

21:44.177 --> 21:45.262
So cute.

21:56.773 --> 21:58.108
I'm home.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.109
You're back.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.863
What's that in your hand?

22:06.908 --> 22:08.118
I forgot.

22:08.910 --> 22:10.370
I'll go there now.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.414
It's okay. Wash up and do your homework.

22:12.497 --> 22:14.041
I'll bring it to him.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.917
I'll go. I can do it.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.128
No, thank you. Give it to me.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.173
I made some juice for you.
It's in the fridge.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.257
But…

22:29.639 --> 22:30.474
If I…

22:32.267 --> 22:34.394
If I had just remembered…

22:37.230 --> 22:38.732
If I had gone straight to my dad

22:39.691 --> 22:41.902
without getting distracted, my mom…

22:44.780 --> 22:46.365
that bastard wouldn't have…

22:52.662 --> 22:54.623
It was all my fault.

23:03.423 --> 23:05.217
You did nothing wrong, Heejung.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.346
The real sinner is out there.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.975
I'm sure that you and your father
know more than anyone

23:16.395 --> 23:19.314
how powerless man-made laws are.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.653
What we are going to do today…

23:27.072 --> 23:29.282
will create a world

23:30.826 --> 23:32.494
where nobody sins.

23:40.293 --> 23:42.295
LAWYER MIN HYEJIN:
DID YOU SEE THE INTERNET?

23:44.297 --> 23:46.466
TRENDING: PARK JUNGJA'S
DECREE CLIP, PARK JUNGJA'S SON,

23:46.550 --> 23:48.385
THE NEW TRUTH LIVESTREAM,
PARK JUNGJA LIVESTREAM

23:48.969 --> 23:50.470
Damn it.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.979
We shouldn't have trusted them.

23:59.813 --> 24:03.400
I'm on my way to Ms. Park's
to get the kids out of there first.

24:03.984 --> 24:07.154
I booked a flight for them.
I'm sending them to Canada right away.

24:07.237 --> 24:09.823
I'll meet you at the airport then. Okay.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.799
CALLING
HONG EUNPYO

24:28.425 --> 24:29.926
-Hi, Kyunghun.
-Hey, Eunpyo.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.720
Park Jungja's identity got leaked.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.138
Bring others with you

24:33.221 --> 24:35.891
and apprehend anyone
who's lingering around her place.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.808
What about you?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.644
The kids are leaving now.
I'm on my way to the airport.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.104
Okay.

24:44.357 --> 24:48.069
Damn, they're so diligent.
Running away already?

24:49.821 --> 24:53.158
Run away all you want.
Let's see how far you can go.

24:53.992 --> 24:57.787
The subject of the upcoming demonstration
is Park Jungja.

24:57.871 --> 25:00.248
Look at her. She looks so scary.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.667
"Is it written all over my face
that I'm bound for Hell?"

25:03.752 --> 25:07.214
I wonder what sin this woman committed
to deserve to go to Hell.

25:07.297 --> 25:08.465
Let us speculate.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.051
She has two kids from different fathers.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.970
But neither of them are around.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.055
What could this mean?

25:16.848 --> 25:18.099
Could she have killed them?

25:18.183 --> 25:21.019
She could have killed them
for insurance money.

25:21.102 --> 25:22.187
I'm just speculating.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.816
Someone just sent me a photo!

25:26.900 --> 25:28.735
Where did you get this?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.111
From her social media?

25:30.195 --> 25:32.989
My dear members are
so good at getting information!

25:33.073 --> 25:34.533
They must be the kids.

25:34.616 --> 25:35.659
You poor things…

25:35.742 --> 25:36.826
Wait, what is that?

25:37.369 --> 25:38.912
Isn't that a bruise?

25:39.454 --> 25:42.707
Did she abuse them?
How could she abuse these beautiful kids?

25:42.791 --> 25:45.835
Bitch, you need to rot in Hell!

25:45.919 --> 25:49.381
Listen, the New Truth and the police.
Are you protecting these kids?

25:49.464 --> 25:53.468
You need to hurry! We don't know
what this crazy woman will do to the kids!

25:53.552 --> 25:57.764
If the police aren't already on it,
we should go and get the kids out of there

25:57.847 --> 26:02.769
because they might be the only witnesses
who can testify against this woman!

26:02.852 --> 26:04.145
-Hurry!
-Hurry.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.063
Be careful.

26:12.445 --> 26:13.905
-Let's go.
-Okay.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.163
Listen, Park Jungja's acquaintances.

26:22.247 --> 26:26.251
You should let the world know
what her sins are,

26:26.334 --> 26:27.544
all right?

26:27.627 --> 26:30.213
You can't keep quiet about it.
That is not the solution!

26:30.797 --> 26:31.798
You guys,

26:31.881 --> 26:34.426
do we still not know
the kids' whereabouts?

26:34.509 --> 26:36.219
Hurry up!

26:36.303 --> 26:40.307
We can't let her commit any more sins!

26:40.390 --> 26:42.934
We need to move!

27:47.999 --> 27:49.501
That's him, right?

27:50.794 --> 27:54.005
The one who brutally murdered your mother.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.184
So that's what he looks like.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.688
I guess this is your first time
seeing him.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.732
They never showed his face.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.319
Not on TV or in the papers.

28:19.614 --> 28:21.074
He looks like

28:21.157 --> 28:25.537
he's doing just fine
after receiving a man-made punishment…

28:28.415 --> 28:30.667
when you and your father

28:32.419 --> 28:35.505
have been living in turmoil
ever since it happened.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.304
Are you sure you won't regret this?

29:19.883 --> 29:22.218
We should hurry. Eunyul, get your sister.

29:22.302 --> 29:23.636
Mom, are we going on a trip?

29:24.137 --> 29:25.263
Eunyul,

29:25.346 --> 29:28.808
you are Hayul's mother from now on.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.560
So…

29:32.562 --> 29:33.855
You can't park here.

29:35.356 --> 29:36.566
Go to the parking lot.

29:36.649 --> 29:38.610
I'll be right back.
It'll just be a minute.

29:44.824 --> 29:47.243
You can't take too long, all right?

29:47.327 --> 29:48.244
Okay.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.330
Let's go.

29:50.413 --> 29:51.748
-Get out.
-Hurry.

29:51.831 --> 29:54.209
Wait for Detective Jin here.
The parking lot is dangerous.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.293
Okay.

30:27.617 --> 30:29.160
Everything's been confirmed.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.163
Let me know when they arrive.
Please take good care of them.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.373
Will do, ma'am.

30:34.457 --> 30:37.252
Eunyul, she will take care of you
until you board the flight.

30:37.335 --> 30:40.171
Someone from our side
will be at the airport there.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.383
Don't get distracted
and take good care of your sister.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.467
You should go now.

30:46.636 --> 30:47.595
Let's go.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.013
Okay.

31:31.973 --> 31:32.807
Let's see.

31:34.684 --> 31:37.061
Eunyul, I need to pee.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.188
Let me take you to the restroom.
Come with me.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.315
Here's your ticket.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.072
Look.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.742
It looks like you.

31:51.659 --> 31:52.744
Try it again.

32:01.711 --> 32:03.963
Hayul, are you in there?

32:21.940 --> 32:23.775
Where is your mother?

32:24.859 --> 32:26.861
Hayul, what are you doing here? Come here.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.495
Stay put until we get off.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.668
Eunyul, when is Mom coming?

33:13.282 --> 33:15.243
-You're here.
-Have the kids left?

33:15.743 --> 33:17.078
I don't know yet.

33:17.578 --> 33:18.830
What about the kids?

33:20.498 --> 33:21.874
That's great.

33:21.958 --> 33:22.875
Thank you so much.

33:23.418 --> 33:25.044
Did they board the flight?

33:25.712 --> 33:28.297
Yes, they did. I just checked.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.925
-Somebody will pick them up, right?
-Thank you so much.

33:31.009 --> 33:34.512
Someone from our side
will be at the airport, so don't worry.

33:34.595 --> 33:35.888
Okay.

33:35.972 --> 33:37.056
Thank you.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.562
I didn't get to say goodbye to them.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.817
I scolded them until the very last moment.

33:54.949 --> 33:57.076
I should've hugged them one last time.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.503
Thank you.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.011
No matter

34:16.679 --> 34:19.515
how many times

34:20.433 --> 34:22.393
they are presented with evidence,

34:23.269 --> 34:27.190
people won't believe it
until they receive a decree themselves.

34:28.483 --> 34:32.528
They complain that God punishes them

34:34.238 --> 34:36.365
even though He created them to be sinful.

34:38.493 --> 34:41.496
Like those kids who blame
their parents for giving them life,

34:42.538 --> 34:44.373
all they do is whine.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.419
Heejung.

37:39.799 --> 37:40.883
Get out of there!

37:40.967 --> 37:42.385
Move!

37:42.468 --> 37:43.678
Step aside.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.595
Get out!

37:45.221 --> 37:46.806
-Stop taking photos.
-Stop!

37:49.058 --> 37:52.103
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message after…

37:57.984 --> 38:00.695
WHY CAN'T I REACH YOU?
DID YOU FORGET YOUR CHARGER?

38:00.778 --> 38:01.696
DID YOU EAT?

38:01.779 --> 38:04.115
-I haven't told him yet.
-You should get ready.

38:04.198 --> 38:05.449
He's here.

38:05.533 --> 38:06.993
Hello, Detective Jin.

38:07.076 --> 38:07.910
-Hey.
-Hello.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.495
The Squad Chief asked for you.

38:09.578 --> 38:10.496
Why?

38:11.539 --> 38:12.873
You should go see him.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.383
An anonymous source provided
information to the press.

38:22.466 --> 38:24.302
Given the information on the ID card…

38:24.385 --> 38:25.386
Come in.

38:27.388 --> 38:29.557
-Hi.
-Just in time.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.768
Come here and watch this.

38:33.769 --> 38:36.314
Let's hear more
from our reporter at the scene.

38:36.397 --> 38:37.481
Reporter Kim?

38:37.565 --> 38:39.859
The police launched an investigation

38:39.942 --> 38:43.612
after a burnt body was found
in an abandoned greenhouse in Jinyang.

38:43.696 --> 38:48.617
They found an ID card in a pile
of ripped clothing near the body,

38:48.701 --> 38:51.537
and they assume that
the body belongs to Kim Changsik,

38:51.620 --> 38:55.708
the culprit of the regeneration area
murder case from six years ago.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.502
Kim was sentenced to six years in custody

38:58.586 --> 39:02.131
and medical treatment as the crime
was committed under the influence.

39:02.214 --> 39:04.633
and had been living in Jinyang
since his release.

39:05.217 --> 39:07.803
After the news broke,
many people on the Internet

39:07.887 --> 39:11.432
pointed out similarities between this case
and the Hapseong Station murder case

39:11.515 --> 39:13.684
and are making religious interpretations.

39:13.768 --> 39:14.602
Meanwhile…

39:14.685 --> 39:18.314
If they had found a body,
they should've called the police.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.985
The reporters got to the scene first,
so the victim's identity leaked.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.487
The police will conduct DNA testing

39:24.570 --> 39:27.031
and analyze surrounding
surveillance footage…

39:27.114 --> 39:29.241
That body belongs to that bastard?

39:29.742 --> 39:33.662
Based on the circumstantial evidence, yes.
But we won't get any DNA evidence.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.457
They'll say that it's not organic matter.

39:36.540 --> 39:37.750
Damn it.

39:45.257 --> 39:47.885
You don't have anything
to do with it, do you?

39:48.469 --> 39:49.887
Of course not.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.433
Ms. Park's lawyers sent the kids
out of the country last night

39:54.517 --> 39:56.602
because her identity was leaked.

39:56.685 --> 39:58.646
They thought the kids
wouldn't be safe here.

40:00.147 --> 40:02.233
This is driving me crazy.

40:03.234 --> 40:05.945
Jinyang police are struggling
with the investigation.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.073
Don't you dare meddle in this case.

40:10.491 --> 40:12.243
The media and press are all over

40:12.326 --> 40:14.995
Park Jungja's pre-announced
murder broadcast tomorrow.

40:17.998 --> 40:19.792
We have to catch the culprits tomorrow.

40:20.835 --> 40:23.129
This will all go away once we catch them.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.385
Six years ago,

40:30.010 --> 40:32.346
there was a woman
who was brutally murdered

40:32.430 --> 40:35.266
while taking her detective husband
a change of clothes.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.559
You remember the case, right?

40:37.143 --> 40:40.479
The murderer was never punished
for what he did.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.275
Instead of punishing him,
they let him get treated in a hospital.

40:44.358 --> 40:45.651
Why?!

40:45.734 --> 40:47.695
Because he was a drug addict.

40:48.279 --> 40:51.574
They claimed that
he had no intention of sinning.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.411
We humans could not punish him.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.370
However!

40:56.454 --> 40:59.290
God has punished him.

40:59.957 --> 41:02.168
"If you sin, you get punished."

41:02.251 --> 41:05.546
We humans have been having a hard time
accepting this simple rule,

41:05.629 --> 41:07.548
and for thousands of years,

41:07.631 --> 41:11.302
God has been patient, patient,
patient, patient, patient with us.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.513
After years of waiting,

41:14.597 --> 41:17.099
God has finally decided to intervene.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.643
God is sending us a message

41:20.478 --> 41:22.813
before the demonstration tomorrow.

41:23.772 --> 41:24.857
Park Jungja.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.360
Park Jungja.

41:29.153 --> 41:32.698
Please, I beg you.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.034
Please confess your sins.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.370
You only have one day to live,

41:38.454 --> 41:43.334
so please do the most meaningful thing
you can do in your life.

41:43.417 --> 41:45.169
I beg you!

41:46.128 --> 41:47.129
I beg you!

41:49.715 --> 41:51.592
-Park Jungja!
-Park Jungja!

41:51.675 --> 41:53.219
-Shall repent!
-Shall repent!

41:53.302 --> 41:55.346
-Her sins!
-Her sins!

41:55.429 --> 41:57.264
Repent!

41:57.348 --> 41:59.683
-Park Jungja, a sinner!
-Park Jungja, a sinner!

41:59.767 --> 42:01.977
-Shall uphold God's will!
-Shall uphold God's will!

42:02.061 --> 42:03.479
-And confess her sins!
-Confess!

42:03.562 --> 42:06.023
-I'll go check on Ms. Park.
-Okay.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.070
-We'll put cameras here. Clear the area.
-Yes, sir.

42:15.115 --> 42:16.033
Come in.

42:28.879 --> 42:30.089
Who drew this?

42:32.091 --> 42:33.050
Hayul did.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.472
Should I find you a place to stay?

42:39.056 --> 42:41.850
It would be difficult for you
to spend a night here.

42:41.934 --> 42:43.060
Excuse me.

42:43.143 --> 42:46.814
Don't you see the crowd outside?
Do you think you can come back here?

42:47.439 --> 42:49.483
-If you can't, the contract is nullified.
-No.

42:50.985 --> 42:52.319
I'm staying here.

42:55.698 --> 42:56.865
I'm comfortable here.

42:58.826 --> 42:59.827
Okay.

43:00.828 --> 43:04.415
EUNYUL, HAYUL, MOM

43:11.463 --> 43:13.299
Yeongho, what's going on?

43:13.382 --> 43:15.426
This is crazy.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.969
What is it this time?

43:17.052 --> 43:19.972
The TV stations
are airing it live tomorrow.

43:20.055 --> 43:21.599
All the major networks.

43:22.099 --> 43:22.975
What?

43:24.685 --> 43:25.853
DIE, PARK JUNGJA
REPENT

43:25.936 --> 43:28.063
Everyone's going crazy.

43:35.654 --> 43:36.905
Hello.

43:37.740 --> 43:41.076
This is Assistant Inspector Jin Kyunghun
at Seobuk Police Station.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.121
I called to ask if you found any evidence.

43:44.204 --> 43:47.499
We can't even begin the investigation
because of the crowd.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.086
They're following us around
and interfering with the investigation.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.256
There is surveillance footage
recorded near his house,

43:54.340 --> 43:56.050
but it's too dark to recognize faces.

43:56.133 --> 43:59.303
Well, if it's not too much trouble,

43:59.386 --> 44:01.930
can I take a look at the footage?

44:02.014 --> 44:04.767
Okay. I will send it to you
when I get back to the station.

44:05.267 --> 44:08.187
All right. Sorry for the trouble
and thank you so much.

44:08.270 --> 44:09.188
Sure.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.164
CALLS
HEEJUNG

44:32.503 --> 44:35.464
Your call cannot be connected.
Please leave a message after…

44:44.848 --> 44:49.436
HEEJUNG'S HOMEROOM TEACHER

44:56.777 --> 44:57.736
Hey! What is it?

44:59.655 --> 45:02.825
-Release our members!
-You cannot investigate God!

45:02.908 --> 45:03.992
Fuck! Beat them up!

45:09.790 --> 45:10.624
You fuckers!

45:27.182 --> 45:29.184
You cannot investigate God!

45:29.268 --> 45:31.937
Release our members!

45:32.521 --> 45:34.106
Let go! Let go of me!

45:35.190 --> 45:37.067
Let go!

45:37.151 --> 45:39.236
You cannot investigate God!

45:51.749 --> 45:53.584
Please check the camera placement.

45:53.667 --> 45:54.960
-Ma'am?
-Yes?

45:55.043 --> 45:59.047
-The cables should go like this.
-We're on it already.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.515
REPENT
CONFESS YOUR SINS

46:18.650 --> 46:22.279
GOD HAS ABANDONED YOU

46:22.362 --> 46:24.156
GO TO HELL

46:25.115 --> 46:26.533
The VIPs are here.

46:41.215 --> 46:44.843
I wonder how much they paid to watch this.

46:47.554 --> 46:49.890
Now I see where
the three billion won came from.

46:49.973 --> 46:54.311
The New Truth may be bigger than we think.

46:56.021 --> 46:58.232
How could all this happen
in just three days?

47:03.695 --> 47:04.571
Oh, right.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.907
Who's Kim Jeongchil?

47:07.825 --> 47:10.410
I got it from the office,
and it was addressed to you.

47:11.078 --> 47:12.788
241-5 GOYANG-SI, GYEONGGI-DO
KIM JEONGCHIL

47:28.512 --> 47:29.638
Are you all right?

47:30.889 --> 47:31.932
Yes.

47:35.352 --> 47:37.187
I don't see Chairman Jung.

47:37.771 --> 47:40.065
He's probably planning on
a grand entrance.

47:40.774 --> 47:42.818
I'm sure he's watching from somewhere.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.404
Is the SWAT team in position?

47:46.071 --> 47:47.865
Team Leader, everything all right?

47:47.948 --> 47:49.658
Yes, no issue.

47:49.741 --> 47:50.951
Roger that.

47:52.119 --> 47:54.788
What's all this fuss about?

48:00.419 --> 48:01.336
Come here.

48:02.379 --> 48:05.007
If anything feels wrong

48:05.507 --> 48:08.093
or Ms. Park Jungja is in danger,

48:08.176 --> 48:11.138
we will do whatever it takes
to protect Ms. Park.

48:11.221 --> 48:12.681
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

48:12.764 --> 48:13.807
Be careful.

48:14.391 --> 48:15.601
Back to your positions.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.855
All right, it is time.

48:20.689 --> 48:23.108
Everyone except the subject, please leave.

48:23.191 --> 48:26.445
Officers, you should wait outside too.

48:28.864 --> 48:31.033
Would you like to talk to your kids?

48:31.116 --> 48:32.826
We don't have time for that.

48:34.411 --> 48:35.454
Not now.

48:37.122 --> 48:38.999
I'll talk to them after this.

48:39.583 --> 48:40.792
Once everything is over.

48:48.967 --> 48:50.177
Please get out.

49:02.731 --> 49:04.566
Hey, make the warning announcement.

49:10.322 --> 49:13.867
PARK JUNGJA REPENT
THE GATES OF HELL ARE OPEN

49:18.038 --> 49:19.998
Be alert. Safeties off.

49:40.811 --> 49:43.021
Ten, nine,

49:43.814 --> 49:49.319
eight, seven, six, five,

49:50.112 --> 49:55.742
four, three, two, one.
