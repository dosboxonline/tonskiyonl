00:22.646 --> 00:25.342
-  Wait, one 

00:26.950 --> 00:29.646
 Wait, two 

00:31.621 --> 00:33.555
 Three 

00:35.625 --> 00:38.150
Hey. What's up, everybody ?

00:38.228 --> 00:40.458
l'm Thurgood Jenkins.
You know, it's funny,

00:40.530 --> 00:45.934
but l can trace the entire path
of my life to one childhood memory.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.902
My last clear memory, really.

00:47.971 --> 00:50.633
You see, it was the summer
before ninth grade.

00:50.707 --> 00:53.369
lt was me, Brian, Kenny,
Scarface...

00:53.443 --> 00:56.207
and of course
the loveable Old James.

00:56.279 --> 01:00.477
Oh, hold on. Wait a minute.
Old James-- Old James wasn't there.

01:00.550 --> 01:05.613
l don't even know nobody named
Old James. Shoot. Go on !

01:07.691 --> 01:11.923
- Why don't you
light it up there, brother ?
- All right. Here goes nothin'.

01:17.634 --> 01:22.833
l don't remember graduatin'.
And my first sexual experience--
l don't remember that either.

01:22.906 --> 01:27.741
- But, man, l will never forget
the first time l smoked...

01:27.811 --> 01:29.904
that sweet, sweet chiva.

01:29.980 --> 01:34.383
- Feel anything ?
- Yeah, l feel my chest cavin' in.

01:34.451 --> 01:37.909
-  This stuff
didn't even work.
- Man !

01:37.988 --> 01:41.219
Come on. Let's get some candy
and get out of here, B.

01:56.273 --> 02:01.108
 l've heard people say
they don't get high
the first time they smoke.

02:01.177 --> 02:03.975
Not me. Oh, not us.

02:04.047 --> 02:07.244
We were really, really high.

02:07.317 --> 02:09.911
We was toe up !

02:18.495 --> 02:21.623
- Do you guys feel different ?
- A little.

02:21.698 --> 02:23.723
How 'bout you, Scarface ?

02:26.336 --> 02:29.533
How you doin', Kenny ? Kenny ?

02:31.074 --> 02:35.010
l haven't been so thirsty
in my entire life.

02:35.078 --> 02:36.807
Do you guys hear that ?

02:36.846 --> 02:42.216
Feels like Jerry Garcia's in my head.
Am l goin' crazy ?

02:42.285 --> 02:47.655
We look at that
day as the day we met the fifth
member of our crew-- marijuana !

02:48.792 --> 02:53.126
- Oh, Lord, we was hooked !

02:53.196 --> 02:55.721
So, now we all live together
in New York.

02:55.799 --> 02:59.428
l myself am a master
of the custodial arts,

02:59.502 --> 03:02.528
or a janitor if you want
to be a dick about it.

03:02.605 --> 03:06.803
Anyway, l work at this lab,
Frankensense and Burr Pharmaceutical.

03:06.876 --> 03:09.538
- They do pharmaceutical testing
for the government...

03:09.612 --> 03:11.671
and big corporations and--

03:11.748 --> 03:15.240
And l am
the happiest custodian alive.

03:17.921 --> 03:20.515
This job... sucks.

03:23.827 --> 03:25.818
Abba-Zabba,

03:25.895 --> 03:27.829
you my only friend.

03:27.897 --> 03:31.025
Ah, it could be worse.
l could have Scarface's job.

03:31.101 --> 03:35.367
- Heifer with cheese.
- You son of a bitch,
l'm right behind you !

03:35.438 --> 03:38.236
Turn around and ask me
for Heifer with cheese, yo !

03:38.308 --> 03:42.074
Why you gotta make me feel inferior
'cause l'm on the grill, B ? Damn !

03:42.145 --> 03:46.104
-  Scarface is kind
of a hyper guy for a pothead.
- Sorry.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.946
Kenny is probably doin'
the best out of all of us.

03:49.018 --> 03:52.010
He's a kindergarten teacher
at some school downtown,

03:52.088 --> 03:56.115
which l know might scare a lot
of parents, seeing as how he's
a weedhead and all.

03:56.192 --> 04:01.152
But let me tell you, man,
that guy does wonders for those
children's self-esteem.

04:01.231 --> 04:04.462
- Thank you.
- Oh, l love you so much, little one.

04:04.534 --> 04:08.698
- 
- All of you. All of you. lt's so good.

04:08.772 --> 04:11.707
-  Brian works
at a new and used record store.
- Hi.

04:11.775 --> 04:15.176
- He gets to talk about music all day.
- l got a used Kenny Loggins album.

04:15.245 --> 04:17.769
Perfect job for a stoner.

04:17.846 --> 04:22.011
Lady, you want seven bucks
for a used Kenny Loggins record ?

04:22.084 --> 04:25.919
- l'll give you five.
- Uh-uh. He autographed it himself.

04:27.891 --> 04:31.657
All right,
l'll give you four.

04:31.728 --> 04:34.128
Jan, stop it, man.

04:34.431 --> 04:37.992
- 
- As far as herb goes, you can
get it all over this town.

04:38.067 --> 04:41.730
l mean, they might call it the city that
never sleeps, but l'll tell you this:

04:41.805 --> 04:46.606
- lt takes a lot of fuckin' weed naps.
- Free !

04:46.676 --> 04:50.077
You can get the stuff at little
corner stores called bodegas.

04:50.146 --> 04:53.274
Say it with me:

04:53.349 --> 04:55.283
Yes, very good.

04:55.351 --> 04:59.310
- These places always have
incredibly old products.
- Como esta, fellas ?

04:59.389 --> 05:01.482
- Hey-Hey.
- But the weed ain't bad.

05:01.558 --> 05:07.190
- Let me get four dime bags.
- Uh, l don't have no idea
what you're talking about.

05:10.500 --> 05:14.960
Jose, you crazy, man. He's crazy.
Come on, man. Let me get them dimes.

05:15.038 --> 05:17.768
See, the problem with bodegas
is they never remember you.

05:17.841 --> 05:21.470
- 
- You always have to do something
extreme to let 'em know you're cool.

05:21.544 --> 05:24.604
Hey, fellas. Y'all know me.
Come on, now. Look at this.

05:24.681 --> 05:29.482
Hey, black ass. Why you
didn't moon us earlier, eh ?

05:29.552 --> 05:31.179
lt was a little degrading.

05:31.254 --> 05:35.213
lf you desperate, you can get it from
the Rastas at Washington Square Park,

05:35.291 --> 05:38.124
but their stuff ain't even weed
most the time.

05:38.194 --> 05:40.128
l don't fall
for that shit anymore.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.194
Then there's a delivery service run
by a guy named Samson Simpson.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.670
Now, when you can afford it,
this is the best way.

05:49.739 --> 05:52.867
l mean, you can get anything
you want, from weed to heroin.

05:52.942 --> 05:55.502
Now, l don't do drugs, though.
Just weed.

05:55.578 --> 05:57.512
- 
- Coming.

05:57.580 --> 06:00.310
See, all you have to do is call
them up, and a half hour later,

06:00.383 --> 06:03.546
you got a delivery guy
at your house.

06:03.620 --> 06:06.646
- 
- What a country !

06:08.324 --> 06:11.191
Hi, you called about your plumbing ?
Empty pipes ?

06:11.261 --> 06:16.358
-  Secret code.
- Come on in.

06:16.432 --> 06:20.232
- You want highs, mediums or lows ?
- How are the highs, man ?

06:20.303 --> 06:24.933
l say they got a piney taste, almost
minty. Notice the little red hairs.

06:25.008 --> 06:26.339
- Yeah.
- And the rich greenery ?

06:26.376 --> 06:30.836
- l see those.
- And it's definitely the highest
grade hydroponics in the city.

06:30.914 --> 06:33.576
What, did you go
to weed college ? Damn, nigger.

06:33.650 --> 06:36.448
All right.
Give me a 50 bag of that.

06:38.187 --> 06:40.712
- Been a pleasure.
- Pleasure's all mine.

06:40.790 --> 06:43.782
- Tell Samson l said hello, would ya ?
- Sure thing.

06:43.860 --> 06:47.489
 Now, everybody has
their own little ritual
when it comes to smokin'.

06:47.564 --> 06:49.964
- Dope has arrived, fellas.
- And we were no different.

06:50.033 --> 06:53.400
- Break out Billy Bong Thornton.
-  Yeah.

06:53.469 --> 06:55.733
Whoo !

06:57.874 --> 07:03.073
Billy, good to see you, man.

07:06.716 --> 07:08.946
All right.
Light it up.

07:09.018 --> 07:10.952
Shoes off.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.880
Oh, Brian,
put yours back on, man.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.257
For real, amigo.
Do your sock laundry, yo.

07:18.328 --> 07:20.455
- 
- 

07:21.531 --> 07:26.798
Gentlemen,
assume your positions.

07:26.869 --> 07:29.838
-  
- Yeah.

07:32.241 --> 07:34.175
Fire in the hole.

07:34.243 --> 07:37.906
 We found it on the corner
So when we say 

07:37.981 --> 07:41.747
-  Bip 
-  Oxygen 

07:41.818 --> 07:45.914
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm--
-  Oh, bip 

07:48.191 --> 07:50.455
 Th-That's good 

07:50.526 --> 07:53.689
- Yo, who's on munchies tonight, yo ?
- Not me.

07:53.763 --> 07:56.163
l guess that'd be me.

07:58.568 --> 08:00.502
What do you guys want ?

08:01.571 --> 08:03.835
Get some...

08:03.906 --> 08:07.467
sour cream and onion chips...

08:07.543 --> 08:09.477

08:09.545 --> 08:11.672
Some beef jerky.

08:57.226 --> 08:59.717
We used to eat it all the time
back in the day.

08:59.796 --> 09:02.788

- You got it.

09:02.865 --> 09:06.392

09:46.609 --> 09:49.077
See the trouble

09:51.047 --> 09:54.141
You're hungry,
aren't ya ? Here.

09:56.753 --> 09:59.119
You like popcorn.

09:59.188 --> 10:03.625
lt makes your teeth go
pop, pop, pop.

10:03.693 --> 10:07.493
This is Buster Phillips, and coming

main man-- Who ? Sir Smoka Lot.

10:12.001 --> 10:13.935
Ha !

10:17.373 --> 10:21.867
This guy is weed crazy.
Look at that.

10:21.944 --> 10:26.608

- Bitch, you know what l want.

10:28.084 --> 10:30.075

10:33.222 --> 10:35.417
 'Cause it's hard bein'
black and gifted 

10:35.491 --> 10:38.619
 Sometimes l wanna throw it

10:38.694 --> 10:41.060

- That is so cool, man.

10:41.130 --> 10:44.429

- What you mean ?

10:44.500 --> 10:49.802

10:49.872 --> 10:53.501
 Everybody knows in my neighborhood

10:53.576 --> 10:56.773
 Samson's shit is blessed
Got the whole town on lockdown 

10:56.846 --> 11:00.145
 That's where

You ate it all.

11:08.357 --> 11:12.384
Gee, you must've been

11:25.575 --> 11:28.237

Officer down !

11:28.311 --> 11:30.677
What the hell

11:33.249 --> 11:35.945

and some Funyuns--

11:36.018 --> 11:39.681
This horse is a diabetic !

11:39.755 --> 11:44.089
Buttercup. Buttercup.

11:44.160 --> 11:47.926
Don't you leave me.
Breathe, Buttercup.

11:47.997 --> 11:51.398
- Breathe.
- Breathe. Breathe.

11:53.302 --> 11:57.033
Why ?

11:57.106 --> 12:01.202

12:03.613 --> 12:05.547

12:12.355 --> 12:15.984

- Shut up ! You're a cop killer.

12:16.058 --> 12:18.856
Cop killer ?

12:18.928 --> 12:21.396
- l love horses.

12:23.799 --> 12:25.733
- Say it.

12:25.801 --> 12:28.861
- Cup. Cup.
- Cup. Cup.

12:37.280 --> 12:40.374
Why must you rage ?
Stop the hate, child.

12:40.449 --> 12:46.319
Bail is set at one million
dollars for the crime of killing
an officer of the law.

12:46.389 --> 12:49.483
And may God have mercy
on your soul, young man.

12:49.558 --> 12:54.291
- Court is adjourned.
- 
Back to your cells. Lockdown.

13:00.303 --> 13:02.362
Good night, Fish.

13:02.438 --> 13:06.704
Fish ! Fish ! Fish ! Fish ! Fish !

13:06.776 --> 13:09.711
- My weed's wearing off.
- 

13:15.885 --> 13:18.911
-  Guess who ?
- Yo. Psst. Thurgood.

13:18.988 --> 13:21.286
- 
- 

13:21.357 --> 13:23.791
- Hey, nigger, what time is it ?
- lt's 8:30.

13:23.859 --> 13:27.124
Kenny didn't come home last night.
We are worried, man.

13:27.196 --> 13:29.130
- Word, yo.
- Where the hell is he ?

13:31.267 --> 13:33.201
Did he just move ?

13:36.372 --> 13:40.001
Kenny called. He's in jail.

13:40.076 --> 13:42.169
He didn't leave
a number.

13:42.244 --> 13:45.008
Sincerely,
The Guy on the couch.

13:48.284 --> 13:52.482
Come on, guys. We gotta get Kenny
out of jail, man.

13:55.591 --> 13:57.991
Hey, Kenny. How they
treatin' you in there ?

13:58.060 --> 14:02.121
Let's just say l'm not gettin'
the respect a cop killer deserves.

14:02.198 --> 14:04.189
All right, time's up.

14:04.266 --> 14:08.635
l was up all night
getting harassed.

14:08.704 --> 14:12.470
- Hi, there, Fish.
- See what l mean ?

14:12.541 --> 14:17.205
l think they're mistakin'
my kindness for weakness. l'm scared.

14:17.279 --> 14:21.943
Hey, Kenny, we're gonna get you
out of there, man.

14:22.018 --> 14:25.215
All we gotta do is raise ten percent
of one million, yo.

14:25.287 --> 14:29.553
- Which, by our calculations--
- ls fucking impossible, man !

14:29.625 --> 14:31.616
Hey !

14:31.694 --> 14:34.026
Sorry, man. l'm sorry.

14:34.096 --> 14:36.496
All my life,

14:36.565 --> 14:40.558
l never screwed up.
l fed the horse.

14:40.636 --> 14:44.766
l didn't know it was a diabetic.
l'm scared.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.105
Kenny, stop crying.
Stop crying, Kenny. Look at me.

14:48.177 --> 14:50.805
Come on. Don't let them
see you cry in there.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.007
- Come on, man. Show me your mean face.
- No.

14:53.082 --> 14:55.209
Yes, show me
your mean face, Kenny.

14:57.653 --> 15:00.713
- 
- That's good.

15:00.790 --> 15:03.816
l mean, work on it a little bit,
but it's good.

15:03.893 --> 15:08.193
- 
- Kenny, how long
can you make it in there ?

15:08.264 --> 15:13.361
l don't know.
Maybe 5:00... 6:30.

15:16.038 --> 15:19.030
Come on, man. lt's gotta be
a little longer than that.

15:19.108 --> 15:22.475
But-But-- But we'll get you out,

15:22.545 --> 15:26.743

15:26.816 --> 15:29.011
Number nine, time's up !

15:29.085 --> 15:32.054
- Time's up, number nine.

15:43.732 --> 15:46.166
He looked all right, man.

15:46.469 --> 15:48.903
They gonna kill

15:48.971 --> 15:53.305
Hey, lady.
Miss, is this your purse ?

15:53.375 --> 15:55.775
- Yes.

15:55.845 --> 15:58.405
l'm a scholar.

15:58.481 --> 16:02.645
- People like me.
- Give it to me.

16:02.718 --> 16:05.414

And your name is ?

16:15.664 --> 16:18.690

- Really ?

16:18.767 --> 16:21.759
Yes. So what's up

16:21.837 --> 16:24.931
- ls that your work uniform ?
- Nah, this is my costume.

16:25.007 --> 16:28.602
Tomorrow l'll be a cowboy,
the day after that an lndian.

16:28.677 --> 16:31.111
Every day of the week, l dress up
like a different Village Person.

16:31.180 --> 16:34.172
lt's a thing l'm into.

16:34.250 --> 16:38.380
Nah, l'm a custodian.
So, what are you here for ?

16:38.454 --> 16:41.685
- Possession of narcotics.
- Wow.

16:41.757 --> 16:45.124
- My father's a drug dealer.
- Wow, that must've been the shit.

16:45.194 --> 16:49.426
- lt ruined his life.
- That must've been shitty.

16:49.498 --> 16:51.989
l don't do drugs.
Drugs make me sick.

16:52.067 --> 16:55.468
They're bad for your body.
Up with hope, down with dope.

16:55.538 --> 16:58.302
Thurgood. Come on, man.
We gotta go.

16:58.374 --> 17:01.400
Get on the train.
Toke up before we go to work.

17:01.477 --> 17:03.968
- 
-  Yo, let's go, B.

17:04.046 --> 17:07.948
-  What are you doing, man ?
- Bouncy. Body.

17:08.017 --> 17:10.076

Do you use Prell ?

17:10.152 --> 17:13.315
Yeah. That's what
l'm talkin' about.

17:14.957 --> 17:18.449
Hey, guys. Meet Mary Jane.

17:18.527 --> 17:20.619
That's what he's sayin'.
We wanna burn one.

17:20.695 --> 17:24.757
No, no.
This is Mary Jane.

17:24.833 --> 17:27.926
Meet her. Say hello to her.
Shake her hand even.

17:28.002 --> 17:30.471
- Oh, my fault. What's up ?
- Hi.

17:30.539 --> 17:33.838
- All right.
- Hey.

17:33.909 --> 17:37.242
Listen, do you guys need a ride ?
l have a car.

17:37.313 --> 17:41.181
- You don't have to take the subway.
- Wow, you smoke ?

17:41.250 --> 17:46.119
- No, my grandmother died
of lung cancer.
- l'm sorry to hear that.

17:46.188 --> 17:49.521
Well, that's all the more
reason to toke up, man. Ease the pain.

17:49.592 --> 17:52.459
Ah ! What l'm talkin' about.

17:54.530 --> 17:59.467
You know, l think what they're tryin'
to say is we'd love a ride home.

17:59.535 --> 18:01.730
Great.

18:01.804 --> 18:04.295
- What the hell's wrong with y'all ?
- She looked good.

18:04.373 --> 18:08.639
- Mary Jane ! What is that about, man ?
- l hate y'all.

18:08.711 --> 18:10.872
Shotgun !

18:13.082 --> 18:17.109
- Hey, thanks for this ride.
We really appreciate it.
- Sure.

18:17.186 --> 18:22.317
Guys, shut up about the weed
for two seconds. l don't want
this girl to know l smoke.

18:22.391 --> 18:24.655
Yeah, it's bad enough
you're a janitor, yo.

18:24.727 --> 18:27.127
Custodian, dick.

18:29.498 --> 18:31.432
- Hey !
- Hey.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.031
 lt's really real 

18:37.139 --> 18:39.073
 lt's really real 

18:39.141 --> 18:41.939
 Said they're lookin'
for brains, guts, looks and skills 

18:42.011 --> 18:44.377
-  Step on up if you think
you fit the bill 
-  Yeah 

18:44.446 --> 18:47.313
 l know what you look like
but looks can be deceivin' 

18:47.383 --> 18:50.181
 Let me check the brain
so l can justify the reason 

18:50.252 --> 18:52.186
-  Yeah 
-  Mister 

18:52.254 --> 18:54.188
-  
-  This good for ya ?

18:54.256 --> 18:57.817
Could you drop me
in the lobby ? lt's perfect.

18:57.893 --> 19:00.191
 l could feel
she wanted me to say something.

19:00.262 --> 19:02.753
l had to make my move
while the guys were asleep.

19:02.831 --> 19:07.200
l'm real bad at this, but you think
sometime we could get together,

19:07.269 --> 19:10.102
maybe go out for some ice cream
or something ?

19:12.408 --> 19:15.844
- Motherfucker said, ''ice cream'' !
- 

19:15.911 --> 19:18.175
- Damn.
- Okay !

19:18.247 --> 19:22.650
- All the boys in the car
need to get out.
- Such a dork, man.

19:22.718 --> 19:24.845
- l'm talkin' to you.
- Thanks a lot, fellas.

19:24.920 --> 19:28.117
-  Thanks for the ride.
- Thurgood !

19:28.190 --> 19:30.624
- l knew it !
- You forgot your hat.

19:30.693 --> 19:33.287
l knew it.

19:33.362 --> 19:37.423
You know, l might've came on too strong
with the whole ice cream thing.

19:37.499 --> 19:39.967
Let me just give you my number.
ls that cool ?

19:40.035 --> 19:41.969
- Okay.
- All right.

19:42.037 --> 19:45.131
Now, don't call too late, 'cause you
know l be strippin' in the evenings.

19:45.207 --> 19:47.141
Joking !

19:48.410 --> 19:51.140
Here you go.
You can call me anytime you want.

19:51.213 --> 19:55.445
- Maybe.
- ''Maybe'' is an acceptable answer.

19:55.517 --> 19:58.884
lt's that ''no'' thing that gets me.
Maybe l'll hear from you.

19:58.954 --> 20:01.013
- Bye.
- Be thinkin' about you.

20:05.427 --> 20:08.658
 Dr. Kablecki,
please report to Clinical Studies.

20:08.731 --> 20:10.665
Dr. Kablecki.

20:10.733 --> 20:13.167
Janitor ? Janitor ?

20:13.235 --> 20:15.169
Aaah !

20:15.237 --> 20:17.637
Sorry about that.
What is it, scientist ?

20:17.706 --> 20:20.504
Could you, uh-- l know this
isn't your responsibility,

20:20.576 --> 20:25.013
but would you be a dear and run
this down to the supply department ?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.446
- lt's on the second floor.
- Just run this down ?

20:27.516 --> 20:31.077
Yes. But make sure you bring
the order right back to me.

20:31.153 --> 20:33.121
l need it A.S.A.P.

20:33.188 --> 20:38.057
Got ya. l know this
isn't your responsibility,
but mop the rest of this shit up.

20:38.127 --> 20:40.186
l'll be right back.

20:41.497 --> 20:45.490
What it smell like ? Smell like--

20:45.567 --> 20:47.558
No.

20:47.636 --> 20:51.299
No. l smell weed, man.

20:51.373 --> 20:54.706
Hey. Here you go.

20:56.011 --> 20:59.174
- This all you need ?
- l guess. l don't know.

21:00.315 --> 21:02.374
- Just a sec.
- Okay. 

21:02.451 --> 21:05.079
Damn.

21:05.154 --> 21:09.420
Either someone's having a party, or
somebody gotta do their shirt laundry.

21:09.491 --> 21:12.585
- 
- Here you go.

21:12.661 --> 21:17.394
One pound of marijuana,
and you can sign for it right here.

21:20.068 --> 21:23.060
l-- l sign for this,
and it's mine ?

21:23.138 --> 21:25.470
And l take it ?

21:28.477 --> 21:31.640
Oh, yeah.

21:36.084 --> 21:38.609
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

21:38.687 --> 21:41.850
Some good shit.

21:41.924 --> 21:47.624
Oh, thank you, thank you,
thank... you.

21:50.165 --> 21:55.899
Look, here's-- here's a little
something for your troubles.

21:56.972 --> 21:59.941
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Shh !

22:00.008 --> 22:03.068
Let's not tell anyone
about it, okay ?

22:03.145 --> 22:05.079
Sure. Shh.

22:07.549 --> 22:10.109
Hey, why didn't you tell me
you were into this shit ?

22:10.185 --> 22:13.313
- We could've been hangin' out
months ago.
-  No, no, no.

22:13.388 --> 22:18.451
The Food and Drug Administration are
having us do a study to determine what,

22:18.527 --> 22:22.759
if any, are the medicinal purposes
of marijuana.

22:22.831 --> 22:25.732
Mmm. Wow.

22:25.801 --> 22:27.769
lf you ever need
a guinea pig, let me know.

22:27.836 --> 22:30.498
My grandfather was
in the Tuskegee experiments.

22:30.572 --> 22:32.506
Oh, really ?

22:32.574 --> 22:35.975
Anyway, thank you,
janitor. Enjoy.

22:36.044 --> 22:39.013
Thank you, scientist.
Got any papers ?

22:42.885 --> 22:46.480
No cocktail party would be
complete without the ice plant.

22:46.555 --> 22:49.649
Hey, fellas.
What's goin' on ?

22:49.725 --> 22:51.659
- What's up ?
- Nothin', man.

22:51.727 --> 22:53.718
Bummin', thinkin' about Kenny.

22:53.795 --> 22:56.889
Yeah.

22:56.965 --> 23:00.025
l got some weed at work today,
if y'all wanna try it out.

23:00.102 --> 23:02.662
Nah, yo. We don't feel like
smokin' right now.

23:02.738 --> 23:06.868
Me neither. Me neither.

23:16.051 --> 23:18.679
- So, y'all want to smoke ?
- l'll get Billy Bong Thornton.

23:18.754 --> 23:21.018
- That's what l'm talkin' about.
- No, Scarface.

23:21.089 --> 23:23.387
No Billy Bong Thornton
without Kenny.

23:23.458 --> 23:28.760
That would not be right, man.
Use Wesley Pipes. Yeah.

23:33.402 --> 23:36.269
Man, they got whole bunch
of this stuff at work.

23:36.338 --> 23:38.966
One of those scientists
gave it to me.

23:39.041 --> 23:43.137
Ain't tried the shit out yet,
but it smells like the bomb.

23:43.211 --> 23:46.840
- All right.
- Yeah, man. Yeah.

23:46.915 --> 23:48.906
l'll do the honors.

23:48.984 --> 23:51.782
-  Excuse me.
- Please do.

24:05.067 --> 24:07.729
Yo, this shit
must be good, B.

24:07.803 --> 24:10.237
My man ain't coughed like
that since back in the day.

24:16.011 --> 24:19.310
You sure l should
do this, man ?

24:22.351 --> 24:25.479
Oh, yeah. That shit made
my head hot.

24:25.554 --> 24:27.488
Oh, man.

24:29.324 --> 24:33.158
Pass it this way.
Don't break the cipher.

24:33.228 --> 24:35.753
Oh-- hold it.
l gotta give The Guy some of this.

24:35.831 --> 24:38.129
The Guy gotta taste this.

24:38.200 --> 24:40.634
- Yeah.
- Hey, Guy.

24:40.702 --> 24:45.765
Hey, man. Sorry to wake you,
but you gotta try this.

24:56.351 --> 24:58.546
l'm takin' it slow, man.

25:00.188 --> 25:02.452
Hey, who's
on munchies tonight ?

25:02.524 --> 25:05.925
We should make
that lazy bitch, The Guy, go.

25:05.994 --> 25:10.055
For real. l don't know about y'all,
but l can't even move.

25:10.132 --> 25:12.293
Real, B, right ?

25:12.367 --> 25:15.131
lt's like
l feel stuck here, yo.

25:15.203 --> 25:18.070
l'm glued to the floor.

25:36.758 --> 25:39.249
You guys feel
like you're floating ?

25:39.327 --> 25:41.921
Yeah. Yeah.

25:43.999 --> 25:47.093
- Wanna go outside ?
- Yeah.

25:59.581 --> 26:02.072
 l don't need to
tell you this, but this weed was...

26:02.150 --> 26:04.914
the shiz-nittle-bam
snip-snap-sack !

26:07.589 --> 26:10.581
-  Look !
-  Wow, look at that !

26:10.659 --> 26:12.923
Hey, you guys.

26:12.994 --> 26:15.929
Let's go check in
on Kenny, huh ?

26:19.634 --> 26:22.797
You're not a fish. You're a man.

26:22.871 --> 26:27.240
You're not a fish.
You're a man.

26:30.946 --> 26:33.210
Where did that come from ?

26:33.281 --> 26:36.580
We've really gotta get
this guy out of jail.

26:36.651 --> 26:42.021
You walk around
on both legs, homo erectus !

26:42.090 --> 26:46.823
 Did l say ''homo'' ?
l didn't mean that !

26:46.895 --> 26:50.661
Thurgood ! 
Thurgood !

26:53.802 --> 26:56.862
l got it ! l know how
we could get Kenny out.

26:56.938 --> 26:59.065
- How ?
- Weed, man.

26:59.141 --> 27:01.735
We'll sell weed.

27:01.810 --> 27:03.937
Man, you can't up
and decide to sell weed.

27:04.012 --> 27:06.879
You gotta know people to plug you
into that kind of thing.

27:06.948 --> 27:08.916
- l do !
- Who you know ?

27:08.984 --> 27:11.680
- You, yo.
- Me ?

27:11.753 --> 27:14.221
What, you think l can just walk in
and take this shit ?

27:14.289 --> 27:16.849
l gotta-- l gotta get
a form from a scientist.

27:16.925 --> 27:21.692
Well, how hard can it be, man ?
There's gotta be forms laying around.

27:21.763 --> 27:24.960
l mean,
they are scientists.

27:25.033 --> 27:27.797
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man ?

27:27.869 --> 27:32.806
Look, l'm not stealin' weed.
We are not sellin' weed.

27:32.874 --> 27:36.207
We are three
reasonably bright young men.

27:36.278 --> 27:38.212
- Bully, man.
- Word, yo.

27:38.280 --> 27:42.580
There has got to be a legitimate way
to come up with this money.

27:42.651 --> 27:45.245
We just gotta think.
That's all that is.

27:52.961 --> 27:54.895
Hmm.

27:54.963 --> 27:57.022
Mm-hmm.

28:01.403 --> 28:04.372
Wait. Wait.
l think l got an idea.

28:04.439 --> 28:08.375
Why don't we sell that shit
we smoked the other night, yo ?

28:08.443 --> 28:10.968
- Yeah.
- You suggested that already.

28:11.046 --> 28:14.106
- For real, B ?
- 

28:14.182 --> 28:16.650
Marijuana affects the memory.

28:16.718 --> 28:18.982
lt won't take us
hardly any time, B.

28:20.222 --> 28:23.089
- Too risky, man.
- Stop bein' such a wussy, yo.

28:23.158 --> 28:25.991
- What other choice do we have, right ?
- Yeah.

28:26.061 --> 28:28.689
Okay, fine. Fine.
We'll do it.

28:28.763 --> 28:33.063
- Yeah.
- Gonna do it till Kenny's out,
and we're done.

28:33.134 --> 28:36.592
We're not drug dealers.
We're fund-raisers.

28:36.671 --> 28:39.697
- Of course, B.
- Bully, man.

28:39.774 --> 28:41.935
Okay.

28:42.010 --> 28:45.605
Scarface, lay it
on me, brother.

28:45.680 --> 28:48.444
Check it out, yo.
lt's like this.

28:48.516 --> 28:51.610
Scarface's plan wasn't that bad.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.450
- Hey, good night, Mike.
- See you tomorrow.

28:54.522 --> 28:57.320
Good night.

28:57.392 --> 29:02.227
All l had to do was get forms from that
scientist that kept calling me janitor,

29:02.297 --> 29:06.097
forge one of the forms and put
the order in like l did before.

29:06.167 --> 29:09.364
- Thank you.
- Then we scraped together
what little money we had...

29:09.437 --> 29:12.736
and bought bikes
to help us move the product,

29:12.807 --> 29:17.369
then stapled samples of our weed
on the back of our business cards.

29:17.445 --> 29:22.212
Then we called the company Mr. Nice Guy
in honor of our friend Kenny.

29:22.284 --> 29:25.913
Hey, uh, you guys believe
in angels or--

29:25.987 --> 29:28.581
Man, give me
your fruit cocktail.

29:31.693 --> 29:33.627
Well, l can't.

29:33.695 --> 29:36.061
lf l did that, then l'd have
to give it to you every day,

29:36.131 --> 29:38.827
and l won't get
all my vitamins.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.597
- Do you know who you're dealing with ?
- Chill, Nasty Nate.

29:42.671 --> 29:46.732
He's my bitch. Anybody gonna
stab him, it's gonna be me.

29:46.808 --> 29:49.572
You got a problem with that ?

29:52.747 --> 29:57.150
Watch your back, Fish, 'cause
Squirrel Master ain't gonna be
there for you all the time.

29:57.218 --> 30:01.416
'Cause next time l come for you,
l'm gonna want some cocktail-- fruit.

30:03.158 --> 30:05.092
Take it.

30:08.330 --> 30:10.264
l'm somebody's bitch.

30:15.203 --> 30:19.367
You guys gotta do something.
There's this guy Nasty Nate
who's after my cocktail fruit,

30:19.441 --> 30:21.375
and everyone here
likes fresh fish.

30:21.443 --> 30:25.174
And then the Squirrel Master came out
of left field and told me l'm his bitch.

30:25.246 --> 30:29.114
- Help !
- Ken, listen. We got a plan.

30:29.184 --> 30:34.053
- What is it ?
- lt's not the most honest plan.
You might not like it.

30:34.122 --> 30:37.888
- We gonna sell weed, yo.
- Yeah, great. Weed. Good. Go.

30:37.959 --> 30:41.554
- All right, man.
- Go !

30:41.629 --> 30:44.189
No more window love.
Go and sell it.

30:44.265 --> 30:47.564
 We figured the best way to
spread the word was to hit the streets.

30:47.635 --> 30:50.570
And hit the streets we did.

30:50.638 --> 30:53.801
-  Mary Jane 
-  How y'all feel about Mary Jane 

30:53.875 --> 30:58.403
-  Y'all don't know about Mary Jane 
-  Mary Jane 

30:58.480 --> 31:02.007
 So listen to what they say
'cause Mary never could trip 

31:02.083 --> 31:05.678
 Mary very, very necessary
Extraordinary bein' Mary 

31:05.754 --> 31:09.417
 To the mortuary, One kiss from
her sweet lips and out come a-vision 

31:09.491 --> 31:12.016
-  
- Three for dinner.

31:13.228 --> 31:15.355
Smoke that
and get back to us.

31:15.430 --> 31:19.833
Mr. Nice Guy has arrived, baby.
He's on.

31:19.901 --> 31:23.837
- All right.
-  l'm in love with Mary Jane
l'm not the only one 

31:23.905 --> 31:27.170
- Oh, yes.
-  Mary likes to play around 

31:27.242 --> 31:29.506
Look at all these people !

31:29.577 --> 31:33.035
 All right, guys. Be quick.
Let's just do this and get out of here.

31:33.114 --> 31:36.515
- Let's go, man.
- Let's go.
- lt's money.

31:36.584 --> 31:38.518
 Mary likes to spread her love 

31:38.586 --> 31:41.282
 And turn my head around 

31:41.356 --> 31:43.483
 l'm in love with Mary Jane 

31:43.558 --> 31:49.087
 She is my main thing
She make me feel all right 

31:49.164 --> 31:52.133
-  She make my heart sing 
- All right, how'd you guys make out ?

31:52.200 --> 31:55.567
- Good. l'm all out of cards, B.
- Me too.

31:55.637 --> 31:58.435
That would make three of us.

31:58.506 --> 32:01.168
All right.
We did our part, right ?

32:01.242 --> 32:03.301
l just hope they smoke it.

32:06.347 --> 32:09.544
-  lf you love me, Mary Jane 
-  Mary Jane 

32:09.617 --> 32:11.551
 We're talkin' about Mary Jane 

32:11.619 --> 32:13.587

32:13.655 --> 32:17.352

32:17.425 --> 32:21.020

32:22.630 --> 32:25.428

-  Mary Jane 

32:25.733 --> 32:28.201
 She make my heart sing 

32:34.809 --> 32:37.903
- This is so--
- We are in business, man.

32:37.979 --> 32:40.504
- Hold on. Hold on.
- 

32:42.984 --> 32:46.920
- Mr. Nice Guy.
- Oh, l may have the wrong number.

32:46.988 --> 32:49.456
Um, is Thurgood around ?

32:49.524 --> 32:53.460
- Speaking.
- Oh, hey, hey. lt's Mary Jane.

32:53.528 --> 32:56.088
Do you remember ? l gave you
a ride home from prison ?

32:56.164 --> 32:58.098
Well, could you be
a little more specific ?

32:58.166 --> 33:00.532
l get so many rides home
from prison.

33:00.602 --> 33:02.797
That was a joke.

33:02.871 --> 33:04.839
Oh.

33:04.906 --> 33:07.101
What happened ? l didn't think
you were gonna call me.

33:07.175 --> 33:11.236
Well, l wasn't, but then l decided
l don't care what my friends think.

33:12.447 --> 33:14.540
See, that was a joke.
Get it ?

33:14.616 --> 33:16.777
- A little joke.
-  Not funny.

33:16.851 --> 33:19.479
So, you wanna
get together ?

33:19.554 --> 33:23.149
Okay. Sure. When ?

33:23.224 --> 33:27.126
How 'bout right now ? Just meet me
at the place you dropped us off at.

33:27.195 --> 33:30.995
Okay. Can you give me
half an hour ?

33:31.065 --> 33:33.056
- Yeah, half an hour's cool.
- Great.

33:33.134 --> 33:35.625
- All right. Okay.
- l'll see you there.

33:36.971 --> 33:39.235
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

33:47.415 --> 33:50.248
l've got a date with Mary Jane !

33:50.318 --> 33:52.252
- Word, yo ?
- Yes !

33:52.320 --> 33:56.654
- All right, man.
- Y'all got money ?

33:56.724 --> 33:59.284
 The date couldn't
have come at a worse time.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.658
l was flat broke.

34:01.729 --> 34:04.664
All my money was tied up
in our drug-dealing venture.

34:04.732 --> 34:09.192
l only had eight bucks.
This was gonna take some careful
budgeting and maneuvering.

34:09.270 --> 34:12.398
- Hey.
- Watch the master at work.

34:12.473 --> 34:15.203
- You look great. You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

34:15.275 --> 34:18.210
You know what ? l was thinkin'
it's so nice out,

34:18.279 --> 34:20.713
wanna go for a walk ?

34:20.782 --> 34:24.013
Yeah, sure.
We can go for a walk.

34:24.085 --> 34:26.018
Good. Good. Let's.

34:26.087 --> 34:28.248
So far, so good.

34:28.322 --> 34:33.761
Three hours and 14 miles later,
l hadn't spent one penny.

34:33.828 --> 34:35.887
Damn, l was good !

34:35.964 --> 34:39.127
- And then it happened.
- l'm hungry too.

34:39.199 --> 34:43.795
- Hey, you wanna
eat at the Happy Palace ?
- Uh, how 'bout a hot dog, huh ?

34:43.871 --> 34:46.567
- Hey, what luck.
- Hot dog.

34:46.641 --> 34:51.772
- Hey, what can l get you ?
- Could l have a hot dog
with ketchup and sauerkraut ?

34:51.846 --> 34:54.679
- Sauerkraut's 50 cents extra.
-  Damn !

34:54.748 --> 34:57.741
l've not had a hot dog
in so long.

34:57.819 --> 35:00.788
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
-  Anything to drink ?

35:00.855 --> 35:03.915
- You son of a bitch !
- Yes. Could l have a Pepsi, please ?

35:03.992 --> 35:08.019
- Anything for you, sir ?
- No. l'm fine. Thank you.

35:08.096 --> 35:11.657
- Greedy bastard !
- Didn't you promise me
ice cream the other day ?

35:11.733 --> 35:14.600
l know a really
good place uptown.

35:14.669 --> 35:16.796
Great. Let's hoof it.

35:16.871 --> 35:20.807
Um, do you mind if we take
a cab this time ?

35:21.876 --> 35:23.810
Sure.

35:29.017 --> 35:30.985
Thanks a lot, buddy.

35:31.052 --> 35:33.145
You should be happy
with the tip l gave you. Damn.

35:33.221 --> 35:36.156
- You should be kissing my ass.
- You guys are greedy.

35:36.224 --> 35:38.192
Best ice cream in town.

35:38.259 --> 35:41.490
- Spare change for some food ?
- Oh.

35:41.562 --> 35:45.999
- Don't mind if l do.
- Thanks, young brother.

35:46.067 --> 35:48.763
No, thank you.

35:50.204 --> 35:55.836
- Mmm. Mmm-mmm.
- Yeah, l mean, l do miss my dad.

35:55.910 --> 35:59.710
But... he deserves
to be where he is.

35:59.781 --> 36:02.579
Drug dealers belong
in jail.

36:02.650 --> 36:05.084
Yeah. Yeah, wow.

36:05.153 --> 36:08.680
Yeah. Um, how long
he been in there ?

36:08.756 --> 36:11.748
- Four years next month.
- Four years.

36:11.826 --> 36:15.193
- And what exactly was he sellin' ?
- Marijuana.

36:15.263 --> 36:18.323
Four years
just for weed ? Damn !

36:18.399 --> 36:20.959
Just ? No, no, no, no.
Not just.

36:21.035 --> 36:24.266
Marijuana is terrible.
lt's a gateway drug.

36:24.339 --> 36:26.398
l mean, everybody knows
that it leads to other stuff.

36:26.474 --> 36:29.034
Yeah, mostly junk food.

36:30.978 --> 36:33.208
You don't smoke weed, do you ?

36:34.916 --> 36:36.850
Come on, Mary Jane.

36:36.918 --> 36:41.082
l mean, do l look like somebody
that would smoke... marijuana ?

36:41.155 --> 36:43.350
So you swear you don't ?

36:43.424 --> 36:45.722
Yeah, sure.

36:45.793 --> 36:50.730
Okay, well, swear on this banana split
that you don't do marijuana.

36:50.798 --> 36:53.665
What ? Oh, my God.

36:53.735 --> 36:56.101
Do you swear ?

36:57.772 --> 37:00.673
Yes, Mary Jane. l swear.

37:00.742 --> 37:03.836
That you got pretty eyes.

37:03.911 --> 37:05.845
That's good.

37:07.281 --> 37:09.215
That's real good.

37:09.283 --> 37:13.583
l got some booty. l got some booty.
l got some booty.

37:13.654 --> 37:15.645
lt was really good too.

37:15.723 --> 37:18.851
Ooh, she was a giver,
a caring nurturer.

37:18.926 --> 37:23.761
She held me in her arms, and it was
like l was 15 years old all over again.

37:23.831 --> 37:26.732
- l was hooked on Mary Jane.
- 

37:27.034 --> 37:31.403
The next mornin' the phones blew up like
we were havin' a fuckin' telethon, man.

37:31.472 --> 37:35.272
Everybody in New York was callin'
to get down with Mr. Nice Guy.

37:35.343 --> 37:38.642
We met all kinds of customers,
like this guy here.

37:38.713 --> 37:40.704
He's what we call
an enhancement smoker,

37:40.782 --> 37:44.878
'cause he thinks marijuana
makes every activity that much better.

37:44.952 --> 37:47.113
- Mi casa es su casa.
- Observe.

37:47.188 --> 37:49.122
- You're Scarface, right ?
- Yeah.

37:49.190 --> 37:51.283
l love Al Pacino, man.

37:51.359 --> 37:54.294
- Did you ever see Scent of a Woman ?
- Yep.

37:56.097 --> 38:01.125
Did you ever see
Scent of a Woman... on weed ?

38:01.202 --> 38:06.230
That's the way to see it, man !
lt's just whacked ! Pow !

38:07.708 --> 38:11.144
- Sixty bucks, yo.
- That's cool, man.

38:11.212 --> 38:13.146
l got it. l got it.

38:15.783 --> 38:20.345
- Did you ever see
the back of a $20 bill, man ?
- Man, l don't know, yo.

38:20.421 --> 38:24.585
Did you ever see the back
of a $20 bill... on weed ?

38:24.659 --> 38:26.991
Oh, there's some weird shit
in there, man !

38:27.061 --> 38:29.120
There's a dude sittin' in the bushes.
Does he have a gun ?

38:29.197 --> 38:31.427
l don't know, man.
What ? What ?

38:31.499 --> 38:33.967
Red team go. Red team go.

38:34.035 --> 38:37.698
- Just some weird shit, man.
- Man, you're fuckin' crazy, yo.

38:37.772 --> 38:40.206
- Take your shit.
- No, that's cool. Thanks, man.

38:40.274 --> 38:43.607
Hey, yo, wait ! Dude, l'm gonna
check out the stars later.

38:43.678 --> 38:48.138
lt's really trippy.
Especially on weed, man.

38:48.216 --> 38:51.879
 A scavenger smoker is
someone who never has weed of their own.

38:51.953 --> 38:54.547
But as soon as you smoke it,
here they come.

38:54.622 --> 38:57.022
- Damn !
- What up ?
- Man !

38:57.091 --> 38:59.286
What's up, dogs ? Scoot over.
Let me get in here, man.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.294
- What y'all doin'?
- Nothin'.

39:01.362 --> 39:03.227
- Nothin'?
- Yeah, just chillin'.

39:03.297 --> 39:06.061
What's the matter ?
Let me inhale it. Let me have some.

39:06.133 --> 39:10.399
All right, man.
Just one hit, you scavenger.

39:10.471 --> 39:12.462
Always come around.

39:18.312 --> 39:20.371
Can't even smoke weed
in peace.

39:22.450 --> 39:25.146
l ain't even into the
motherfucker yet. Back up, brother.

39:25.219 --> 39:28.711
You know we sell this ?
l don't know if you knew that.

39:28.789 --> 39:32.247
lt's too bad, man.
l just stopped smokin' yesterday.

39:37.665 --> 39:41.328
l'm gonna get up out of here.
Y'all stay up, now. Nice seeing y'all.

39:41.402 --> 39:44.496
- Yeah. Look at that shit.
- Man.

39:44.572 --> 39:46.506
Then there's the ''You
Should've Been There'' smoker.

39:46.574 --> 39:50.101
They love talkin' about the old days,
back when weed was grass.

39:50.177 --> 39:53.169
Hell, back in the '60s, we used to
smoke that shit on the street.

39:53.247 --> 39:57.047
Cops didn't say nothin'.
Hell, they was gettin' high too.
Everybody was doin' it.

39:57.118 --> 39:59.643
- Mm.
- lt wasn't the thing to do because
it was the thing to do, you know ?

39:59.720 --> 40:01.915
lt was the thing to do
because it got you high.

40:01.989 --> 40:04.924
- Can you dig ?
- l feel ya. That's why l'm doin' it.

40:04.992 --> 40:09.554
l feel it. Man, you're cool
as shit, mister.

40:09.630 --> 40:13.088
l hate to do it, but l gotta
charge you. That's 60 bucks.

40:13.167 --> 40:15.829
- Sixty bucks ?
- Yeah.

40:15.903 --> 40:19.999
Man, l remember when a dime bag
cost a dime, you know what l mean ?

40:21.709 --> 40:25.475
- You know how much condoms
used to cost in them days ?
- How much ?

40:25.546 --> 40:28.208
l don't know.
l-- We never used 'em.

40:28.282 --> 40:31.115
We call this kid
the ''After School Special'' smoker.

40:31.185 --> 40:33.745
He spends all
of his allowance on reefer.

40:33.821 --> 40:36.381
Thanks, little buddy.

40:36.457 --> 40:39.984
Now, in the next room, his father,
an ''l'm 40, But l'm Still Cool'' smoker,

40:40.061 --> 40:44.157
is tokin' up, trying to figure
out a way to bond with his son.

40:44.231 --> 40:47.997
lsn't that ironic ?
Don't you think ?

40:48.069 --> 40:51.903
'Course across town, the kid's Nana's
smokin' up, tryin' to ease her glaucoma.

40:51.973 --> 40:55.272
And it's good
for arthritis too.

40:55.343 --> 40:58.540
- We made over 20 grand
that first week, man.
- 

40:58.613 --> 41:02.709
And because we were stealin' the weed,
not buyin' it, it was all profit.

41:02.783 --> 41:06.310
But if we were gonna save Kenny,
we had to deliver full-time.

41:06.387 --> 41:09.220
Scarface quit his job.

41:09.290 --> 41:12.020
Still waiting
on that Heifer, Julio.

41:14.762 --> 41:16.889
Fuck you. Fuck you.

41:16.964 --> 41:19.956
Fuck you. You're cool.

41:20.034 --> 41:22.832
And fuck you. l'm out !

41:24.939 --> 41:29.342
Brian was gonna quit,
but they fired him before he could.

41:37.685 --> 41:42.349
Don't worry. Don't worry.

41:42.423 --> 41:46.018
l'm not gonna do what
everyone thinks l'm gonna do:

41:46.093 --> 41:49.358
Flip out, man !

41:49.430 --> 41:54.231
All l wanna know is:
who's comin' with me ?

41:57.171 --> 42:00.163
Who's comin', man ?
Who's comin' with me ?

42:01.342 --> 42:05.472
Huh ? Who's comin' with me, man ?

42:06.647 --> 42:10.515
- l will.
- Jan.

42:10.584 --> 42:14.577
Thank you, Jan. Yeah.

42:16.891 --> 42:19.257
That's what
l'm talkin' about.

42:19.326 --> 42:22.227
Bully, man. Yeah.

42:28.302 --> 42:32.830
Jan, will you be
my girlfriend ?

42:32.907 --> 42:36.843
l would... but l'm gay,
you know ?

42:36.911 --> 42:38.902
- Ohh.
- l'm a big dyke.

42:38.979 --> 42:40.913
What's that like ?

42:40.981 --> 42:43.609
- 
- Thank you for calling.
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

42:43.684 --> 42:46.812
We had to hire that girl Jan
'cause she followed Brian.

42:46.887 --> 42:48.855
- But it actually worked out.
- Mr. Nice Guy.

42:48.923 --> 42:52.188
She was more organized than we were,
and she was willing to work for weed.

42:52.259 --> 42:54.193
All right, then.

42:54.261 --> 42:57.788
Mr. Nice Guy
was blowin' up, man.

42:57.865 --> 43:01.062
We got customers
from all over New York.

43:01.135 --> 43:03.899
- We even stole a few from Samson.
- 
Oh, what's up, nigger ?

43:03.971 --> 43:06.940
Come on in, man.
Come on, weed man.

43:07.007 --> 43:08.941
Thanks, baby.

43:09.009 --> 43:11.978
Get on. Beat it.
You're scarin' him.

43:12.046 --> 43:15.880
Ha ! Sir Smoka Lot.

43:15.950 --> 43:18.180
- What can l get you today, Smoka Lot ?
- Love weed.

43:18.252 --> 43:21.221
Um, let me get a pound
of your sweetest chiva.

43:21.288 --> 43:24.655
Damn. Yes ! Somethin' told me
to bring a lot of weed, man.

43:24.725 --> 43:29.389
Aw, shit. Pound
of my sweetest chiva.

43:29.463 --> 43:32.432
- Don't get no better than that.
- Can smell it through the bag.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.060
That's gonna be
9,600 bucks, bro.

43:35.136 --> 43:37.263
Let's see what l got here.

43:40.474 --> 43:43.272
Come on, man. Hang out
for a minute. Smoke with me.

43:43.344 --> 43:45.835
l got weed. l got my bong out.
Come on, son.

43:45.913 --> 43:49.371
For you, man,
l'll stay for a minute.

43:49.450 --> 43:52.146
But then l gotta be--
gotta be goin'.

43:52.219 --> 43:55.120
l understand.

43:55.189 --> 44:00.354
And Smoka Lot opened up to me like l
was Barbara Walters. lt was ridiculous.

44:00.427 --> 44:05.455
- He told me about his lawyer.
- He had sex with my mama ! Why ?

44:05.533 --> 44:09.333
- His spirituality.
- God, if you listenin'... help !

44:09.403 --> 44:11.997
- His bad back.
- Doctor said l need a backeotomy.

44:12.072 --> 44:15.940
- His love life.
- l'm impotent, man.
Get away from me, bitch !

44:16.010 --> 44:19.173
-l mean, talk about a guy with problems.
-Tough break.

44:19.246 --> 44:23.273
- l can't take it no more.
- No wonder he smokes a pound a week.

44:23.350 --> 44:27.081
- Somebody ?
- So now we had a famous clientele and--

44:27.154 --> 44:29.088
Greeneyes gonna miss ya.

44:29.156 --> 44:33.286
- And guess what else ?
- Call me next week...
about weed, about weed.

44:33.360 --> 44:36.796
l got more booty !
l got more booty !

44:36.864 --> 44:39.731
l don't mean
to rub it in, folks.

44:39.800 --> 44:41.768
lt's just that, you know,
l liked this so much, man.

44:41.836 --> 44:44.737
When l was with her,
l didn't even think about weed.

44:44.805 --> 44:47.035
- Didn't have to.
- Bye.

44:47.107 --> 44:50.702
- She was all the Mary Jane l needed.
- 

44:50.778 --> 44:53.144
 When l was young 

44:53.214 --> 44:57.310
 l never needed anyone 

44:57.384 --> 45:01.514
 Makin' love
was just for fun 

45:01.589 --> 45:03.921
 Those days are gone 

45:06.994 --> 45:11.897
 All by myself 

45:26.680 --> 45:31.515
What did l tell you, Nate ?
Come on. Come on.

45:31.585 --> 45:34.281
Come on. Come on, Nate.

45:34.355 --> 45:37.119
- 
-  He had to stay vigilant.

45:37.191 --> 45:41.389
- Wash off your han--
- Kenny's butthole
was in constant jeopardy.

45:41.462 --> 45:44.192
- But we were makin' money.
- Hey, what's up, mates ?

45:44.265 --> 45:46.961
-  What's up, man ?
- What's up, boy ?

45:47.034 --> 45:49.901
- What's up, yo ?
- Nada. l'm just chillin'.

45:49.970 --> 45:53.428
Hey, guys. Why is there a dog
biting The Guy ?

45:53.507 --> 45:57.466
-  'Cause l bought a dog, B.
- Bought a dog ?

45:57.544 --> 46:00.604
- For how much ?
- Oh, it's cool. Yo, he's used.

46:00.681 --> 46:03.275
lncluding the house,
it was only 250, yo.

46:03.350 --> 46:06.717
You spent $250
on a used dog ?

46:06.787 --> 46:09.551
And a dog house, yo.
Brian bought something too.

46:09.623 --> 46:14.822
For $400, l got Jerry Garcia
in a pouch, man.

46:14.895 --> 46:18.956
- Who the hell told you that ?
- The guy who sold it to me.
Barry Garcia.

46:19.033 --> 46:21.263
And what he's supposed to be ?
Jerry Garcia's brother ?

46:21.335 --> 46:25.795
No. Actually,
it's Andy Garcia's brother.

46:25.873 --> 46:29.969
Why the hell
are you guys spendin' money ?
We're not drug dealers, remember ?

46:30.044 --> 46:35.175
- We're fund-raisers.
- Well, you said you gave
Mary Jane a pearl necklace.

46:35.249 --> 46:37.843
- How much did that cost, man ?
- Ah.

46:37.918 --> 46:41.615
You know, obviously you missed
the point of that story, Brian.

46:41.689 --> 46:44.249
- Come on, guys. Return this shit.
- We can't, yo.

46:44.325 --> 46:48.386
- Why am l tellin' Mary Jane
l don't have any money ?
- 'Cause you're a fibber.

46:48.462 --> 46:51.898
No, because we don't
have any money.

46:51.966 --> 46:54.093
The money we do have
is not for spending.

46:54.168 --> 46:58.662
lt's for saving Kenny's
sweet virgin ass, man !

46:58.739 --> 47:03.267
lf you guys spend one more dime,
l swear l will bitch-slap you.

47:04.511 --> 47:06.445
Gimme that.

47:08.115 --> 47:12.074
Sorry for yelling.
But l'm serious.

47:12.152 --> 47:16.418
 We gotta start
bein' more responsible and focused.

47:16.490 --> 47:18.822
All right ? Let's be sharp.

47:18.892 --> 47:22.453
Scarface, your dog is mean, man.

47:22.529 --> 47:24.520
l know, all right.

47:24.598 --> 47:27.726
Somebody gotta do somethin'
about this shit right now.

47:27.801 --> 47:29.735
Mmm. Come here, doggie.

47:29.803 --> 47:32.397
- Hey, little fella. Smell it ?
- 

47:32.473 --> 47:37.501
Hey ! Smell it.
Okay. All right. Mm.

47:37.578 --> 47:39.842
- Good boy.
- 

47:39.913 --> 47:42.848
- He likes it.
- He loves it, man.

47:42.916 --> 47:46.477
- Of course he loves it.
- Yeah, your paws are tingling,
aren't they ?

47:46.553 --> 47:49.681
- Now you're one of us.
- 

47:51.325 --> 47:54.488
-  Get it, Killer.
- 

47:54.561 --> 48:00.227
-  He likes it, yo.
-  Yeah, man,
he really likes it.

48:00.300 --> 48:03.997
- Good for you, man.
- Man, what did you guys do to him, yo ?

48:04.071 --> 48:07.507
-  Nothin', man.
- Yo, Killer. Kill ! Killer, kill !

48:16.016 --> 48:18.780
This weed is fantastic !

48:23.257 --> 48:25.452
 We kept pluggin' away
with the weed deliveries,

48:25.526 --> 48:29.292
and we kept meetin' different kinds
of smokers, like this lady.

48:29.363 --> 48:31.763
- She's an ''l'm Only Creative
lf l Smoke'' smoker.
- Hi.

48:31.832 --> 48:35.825
She believes weed, and only weed,
brings out the artist in her.

48:37.304 --> 48:40.034
- Would you like to hear
some of my poetry ?
- Not really.

48:40.107 --> 48:42.098
You really should.

48:44.044 --> 48:47.980
l have killed.
l have helped kill.

48:48.048 --> 48:53.543
l have killed part of myself.
l cannot change this, l.

48:53.620 --> 48:57.283
l must seek Buddha.
l must seek Christ.

48:58.959 --> 49:03.760
You must seek therapy. That's what
l would go with, but that's my own--

49:03.831 --> 49:07.733
 The MacGyver smoker
is a very handy guy to have around,

49:07.801 --> 49:09.735
especially when it comes
to reefer.

49:10.871 --> 49:13.169
Hey, man,
we're out of papers.

49:13.240 --> 49:17.301
All right. Then get me a toilet paper
roll, a corkscrew and some tin foil.

49:17.377 --> 49:20.346
We don't have a corkscrew.

49:20.414 --> 49:24.009
All right. Then get me an avocado,
an ice pick and my snorkel.

49:24.084 --> 49:27.781
Trust me, bro.
l've made bongs with less. Hurry up !

49:27.855 --> 49:30.346
-  And then you got
your straight-up potheads.
- Ooh !

49:30.424 --> 49:33.484
You can spot these people
by their lack of motivation,

49:33.560 --> 49:38.463
mood swings, forgetfulness and,
of course, the dreaded low sperm count.

49:38.532 --> 49:43.060
l don't know
which one of these categories
we fall into, but l'll tell you this:

49:43.137 --> 49:45.332
We ain't no goddamn potheads.

49:45.405 --> 49:47.168
Hmm.

49:47.241 --> 49:49.368
Shit.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.907
Then you have
the avid nonsmoker.

49:51.979 --> 49:55.608
A lot of times they'll get
your number accidentally
from one of their girlfriends,

49:55.682 --> 49:58.617
call up and place an order
knowing they don't smoke weed...

49:58.685 --> 50:01.313
and request
that you personally deliver it.

50:01.388 --> 50:05.848
Then when you get there, they're
all mad that it's you sellin' weed.

50:05.926 --> 50:10.863
You smoke weed ? At last
we can share everything.

50:10.931 --> 50:14.833
Get off me, you lying
son of a bitch ! What is this ?

50:14.902 --> 50:17.302
Looks like some sort
of a business card.

50:17.371 --> 50:21.171
Yeah, with your number on it.
You know, l can't believe this !

50:21.241 --> 50:25.075
l can't believe that l fell for another
one of you lowlife assholes again.

50:25.145 --> 50:28.273
- God, what is wrong with me ?
- Hey--

50:28.348 --> 50:30.873
Hey, Mary Jane, l can explain
everything, all right ?

50:30.951 --> 50:33.146
- Good-bye, Thurgood.
- Wait ! Hold up !

50:33.220 --> 50:35.245
Hey, Mary Jane !

50:35.322 --> 50:39.656
Mary Jane, look, the only reason
l lied to you was because l like you...

50:39.726 --> 50:41.660
and l wanted
to be with you.

50:42.729 --> 50:44.663
Mary Jane.

50:55.809 --> 50:57.743
Knight Rider.

50:57.811 --> 51:00.405
A shadowy flight
into the dangerous world...

51:00.480 --> 51:03.608
of a man who does not exist.

51:06.787 --> 51:10.120
Thurgood, why the long face, man?

51:10.190 --> 51:12.784
- Mary Jane dumped me.
- Shh. Quiet down, yo.

51:12.859 --> 51:15.885
- Sir Smoka Lot's on TV.
- Cecil ?

51:15.963 --> 51:19.922
 When life is hard, l pick up
that card with the smiley face 

51:20.000 --> 51:23.731
-  Call him over to my place 
- 

51:26.306 --> 51:29.139
 Box it
Man, it gets you high 

51:29.209 --> 51:31.939
-  
-  And that's
when things started going wrong.

51:32.012 --> 51:37.075
 Samson, it looks like somebody
is cuttin' into your business, baby.

51:37.150 --> 51:41.382
- Shit.
- Do you like what you see, Samson ?

51:41.455 --> 51:43.389
Do l look like
l like what l see ?

51:44.458 --> 51:47.325
Who is this
Mr. Nice Guy ?

51:47.394 --> 51:50.420
l would imagine he's
some sort of drug dealer.

51:50.497 --> 51:52.556
Go get me this Mr. Nice Guy.

51:52.633 --> 51:55.966
- l wanna sit him down
and ask him some questions.
- 

52:00.007 --> 52:02.498
- Hey, Squirrel Master.
- Kenny.

52:03.910 --> 52:07.744
Listen, uh, l, uh,
just wanted to say thank you...

52:07.814 --> 52:10.248
for protecting me back there.

52:10.317 --> 52:14.219
- We didn't mind.
Huh ? Did we, Fuzzy Nuts ?
- 

52:14.288 --> 52:17.815
l hope there's some way l can pay
you back when we get on the outside.

52:17.891 --> 52:21.088
You better hurry up.
l get out in 11 days.

52:21.161 --> 52:23.288
ls that right ?

52:28.702 --> 52:32.604
Kenny, 11 days ?
That seems a little stiff, man.

52:32.673 --> 52:36.131
Eleven days, Thurgood,
l'm as good as skewered.

52:36.209 --> 52:39.701
Ever take your clothes off
and run backwards through a cornfield ?

52:39.780 --> 52:42.340
- Ooh.
- Hurry, Thurgood.

52:42.416 --> 52:45.852
l'm countin' on you, man !
Please ! Please !

52:45.919 --> 52:48.979
 Eleven days wasn't
gonna give us much time.

52:49.056 --> 52:52.651
We really had to hustle, and
that meant takin' on new customers.

53:06.640 --> 53:10.667
Damn, B ! l been set up.

53:13.814 --> 53:16.180
We'll get back to that in a second.

53:16.249 --> 53:19.685
But meanwhile l hadn't seen
Mary Jane in, like, a week.

53:19.753 --> 53:23.120
l couldn't stop thinkin'
about her, man. l missed her.

53:23.190 --> 53:28.059
Then l started thinkin' about
the fact that she was the only
girl l slept with in five years.

53:28.128 --> 53:31.256
Then l started thinkin' about the girl
l slept with before Mary Jane.

53:33.233 --> 53:35.827
l had to get Mary Jane back.

53:35.902 --> 53:39.804
- 
- What do you want ?

53:40.941 --> 53:43.603
l want you back, Mary Jane.

53:43.677 --> 53:48.637
l miss you. l'll do whatever
it takes to get you back.

53:48.715 --> 53:51.650
l can't quit sellin' it yet,
but l'll quit smokin' it.

53:51.718 --> 53:55.051
lf that's what you want, then--
then l'll change for you.

53:55.122 --> 53:58.421
- Heard that before.
- Said that before.

53:58.492 --> 54:02.690
But this time l mean it. l'm gonna
come back here. l'm gonna be clean.

54:02.763 --> 54:06.164
l'm gonna be sober.
There's no more weed, no more nothin'.

54:06.233 --> 54:10.897
Mary Jane, you'll see.
l'll be back. l'll be a changed man.

54:10.971 --> 54:13.371
There's a new
Thurgood Jenkins today.

54:14.975 --> 54:17.671
l love you.

54:17.744 --> 54:20.372
 Man, that first day
of sobriety sucked.

54:20.447 --> 54:25.407
And l realized something:
l was a real irritable guy
when l wasn't smokin' marijuana.

54:25.485 --> 54:28.386
l couldn't stop thinkin'
about gettin' high.

54:28.455 --> 54:30.923
lt was time to get help.

54:30.991 --> 54:34.358
Hi, everyone.
My name is Thurgood.

54:34.428 --> 54:38.797
-  Hi, Thurgood.
- Hi.

54:38.865 --> 54:43.529
l'm here today because
l'm addicted... to marijuana.

54:43.603 --> 54:47.266
- 
- You in here because of marijuana ?

54:47.340 --> 54:49.399
Marijuana ?

54:49.476 --> 54:52.240
Man, this is some bullshit !

54:52.312 --> 54:54.280
Marijuana is not a drug.

54:54.347 --> 54:58.078
- l used to suck dick for coke.
- l seen him !

54:58.151 --> 55:00.085
And that's an addiction, man.

55:00.153 --> 55:02.314
- You ever suck dick for marijuana ?
- Huh ?

55:04.691 --> 55:08.457
- No. No, l can't say l have.
- l didn't think so.

55:08.528 --> 55:11.429
- Boo this man !
-  Boo !

55:21.107 --> 55:23.268
No.

55:23.343 --> 55:26.005
No !

55:26.079 --> 55:28.604
No !

55:28.682 --> 55:30.741
Devil man.

55:30.817 --> 55:34.617
Devil-- 666--
The mark of the beast !

55:34.688 --> 55:37.885
No ! Naughty !

55:37.958 --> 55:40.586
Naughty jungle of love !

55:43.430 --> 55:46.365
- The man is serious.
- Calm down. How serious can it be ?

55:46.433 --> 55:49.368
He wants to see Mr. Nice Guy.
He told me.

55:53.573 --> 55:55.507
Oh, man.

55:57.777 --> 56:00.143
No, yo !

56:00.213 --> 56:02.306
They killed Killer, B !

56:03.583 --> 56:06.279
Yo, Samson did this, man.

56:07.354 --> 56:10.221
Yo, he killed Killer, man.

56:10.290 --> 56:13.191
- Hey.
- He killed--

56:13.260 --> 56:15.820
l'm gonna call Brian.

56:15.896 --> 56:18.763
- Let's just give him
a proper burial, all right ?
- 

56:18.832 --> 56:21.300
l'm sorry, man.

56:21.368 --> 56:23.302
Jesus Christ.

56:23.370 --> 56:27.170
- Oh ! l'm sorry.
- Watch it, man !
You stepped on his head !

56:27.240 --> 56:30.175
l'm sorry.
l didn't even see him.

57:03.310 --> 57:06.370
l gotta smoke.
l have got to smoke.

57:07.447 --> 57:09.847
- 
- What happened, man ?

57:09.916 --> 57:13.283
You wanna know what happened ?
l'll tell you what happened.

57:13.353 --> 57:16.720
Samson and his girls
came rollin' up in here lookin' for me.

57:16.790 --> 57:20.089
They was gonna mess me up
if l didn't bring them Mr. Nice Guy.

57:20.160 --> 57:22.685
So they probably
roughed the Guy up,

57:22.762 --> 57:25.356
then they started
goin' to war with the apartment.

57:25.432 --> 57:28.765
They had num-chuks, bolos.
They be doin' lndian burns.

57:28.835 --> 57:31.360
Killer paid the price, yo.

57:31.438 --> 57:35.704
He got the wrath. He got
the wrath of the num-chuks, yo.

57:36.743 --> 57:40.611
l think it's more complex
than that.

57:40.680 --> 57:45.140
- More complex than that ?
- You know what l think happened ?

57:45.218 --> 57:48.449
You want to hear
what l think, man ?

57:50.457 --> 57:54.484
First of all, to understand
what happened to Killer,

57:54.561 --> 57:58.725
you gotta understand
who Killer the dog was.

57:58.798 --> 58:02.256
Now, Killer was born
to a three-legged bitch mother.

58:02.335 --> 58:05.304
He was always
ashamed of this, man.

58:05.372 --> 58:10.105
And right after that, he's adopted
by this man, Tito Liebowitz.

58:10.176 --> 58:12.872
He's a small-time gunrunner...

58:12.946 --> 58:15.210
and, uh,
rottweiler fight promoter.

58:15.281 --> 58:19.047
So he puts Killer into training.
They see Killer's good.

58:19.119 --> 58:21.246
He is damn good.

58:21.321 --> 58:25.257
But then he had
the fight of his life.

58:25.325 --> 58:28.692
They pit him against
his brother Nibbles.

58:28.762 --> 58:32.596
And Killer said, ''No, man, that's
my brother. l can't fight Nibbles !''

58:32.666 --> 58:35.464
And he made 'em fight anyway.

58:35.535 --> 58:38.333
And then Killer,
he killed Nibbles.

58:39.406 --> 58:42.170
And Killer said, ''That's it.''

58:42.242 --> 58:47.839
He called off all his fights, and he
started doing crack, and he freaked out.

58:47.914 --> 58:52.146
And then in a rage,
he collapsed,

58:52.218 --> 58:54.413
and his heart...

58:54.487 --> 58:56.717
no longer beat.

58:58.792 --> 59:01.022
Wow.

59:01.094 --> 59:03.494
You know, uh,

59:03.563 --> 59:06.498
l never thought l'd say
this to anybody,

59:06.566 --> 59:10.058
but you two smoke
entirely too much reefer.

59:10.136 --> 59:13.299
What if The Guy did it ?

59:13.373 --> 59:16.001
No way. You think ?

59:16.076 --> 59:18.010
Yo ?

59:22.015 --> 59:25.109
Yo, The Guy,
did you kill my dog ?

59:30.190 --> 59:33.626
l believe him, yo.
l don't know why, but l do.

59:38.465 --> 59:40.399
Samson did this shit, yo.

59:44.170 --> 59:46.434
Mr. Nice Guy,
Party Accessories.

59:46.506 --> 59:48.997
Well, did you get
my message ?

59:49.075 --> 59:53.171
- Who is this ?
- This is Samson, smarty-pants.

59:53.246 --> 59:55.976
 Operator with an
emergency breakthrough from your sister.

59:56.049 --> 59:58.745
Samson, this is Sheila. Mama fell--

59:58.818 --> 01:00:00.752
Shut up, bitch !

01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:04.483
You tell Mr. Nice Guy
to get his Jamaican ass...

01:00:04.557 --> 01:00:07.549
over to my place
at 3:00 tomorrow !

01:00:07.627 --> 01:00:11.893
- Now, you don't want me to get ugly.
- No, sir.

01:00:11.965 --> 01:00:14.627
- Shit.
- All right. l'll tell 'em.

01:00:15.969 --> 01:00:18.267
Oh, my God.

01:00:18.338 --> 01:00:21.136
We're in a lot of trouble.

01:00:21.207 --> 01:00:25.268
Scarface, perhaps
you could help me.

01:00:25.345 --> 01:00:29.839
Why do you think Samson thinks
that Mr. Nice Guy's a Jamaican ?

01:00:29.916 --> 01:00:33.408
Oh, 'cause l told him
Mr. Nice Guy was Jamaican, yo.

01:00:33.486 --> 01:00:38.822
- Why ?
- l just thought he sounded
Jamaican inside my head.

01:00:38.892 --> 01:00:41.656
We're in a lot
of trouble, guys.

01:00:41.728 --> 01:00:46.222
We have a meeting
with Samson tomorrow at 3:00.
Where are we gonna get a Jamaican ?

01:00:46.299 --> 01:00:49.860
l'll pretend
l'm Jamaican, man.

01:00:49.936 --> 01:00:51.870
Yeah.

01:00:53.673 --> 01:00:56.107
You have smoked yourself
retarded.

01:01:00.647 --> 01:01:06.244
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Mr. Nice Guy.

01:01:07.587 --> 01:01:10.385
Welcome to my lair.

01:01:10.456 --> 01:01:14.483
Well, now. Tell me
a little bit about yourself.

01:01:17.230 --> 01:01:21.997
Well, you know, l be from
Jamaica, man. Lord have mercy.

01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:24.298
What part of Jamaica ?

01:01:24.370 --> 01:01:27.703
Right near the beach--
 Boy 

01:01:27.774 --> 01:01:31.039
l think
you're bullshitting me.

01:01:31.110 --> 01:01:34.546
Samson Simpson,
l stick by my story !

01:01:34.614 --> 01:01:36.548
l'm from Jamaica.

01:01:36.616 --> 01:01:42.179
lf l wasn't Jamaican, then why
would l wear this hat ? Hmm ?

01:01:42.255 --> 01:01:44.382
Delilah,

01:01:45.458 --> 01:01:48.757
get me 814.

01:01:48.828 --> 01:01:51.524
814.

01:01:51.598 --> 01:01:54.533
What the fuck is 814 ?

01:01:59.472 --> 01:02:05.377
Oh ! l'm sorry, y'all.
l don't want to be the first nigger
to die from a crossbow.

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:08.903
You know, l have been
lying to you.

01:02:08.982 --> 01:02:12.941
l'm sorry.
Samson, l'm sorry. Okay ?

01:02:13.019 --> 01:02:16.011
We-- We just started this
because our friend got locked up.

01:02:16.089 --> 01:02:19.525
Brother, you know how that is.
We had to get him outta jail.

01:02:19.592 --> 01:02:22.026
Now this
is what's gonna happen.

01:02:22.095 --> 01:02:25.360
You make about 40,000,
50,000 a week.

01:02:25.431 --> 01:02:27.922
Shit. l wish.

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:30.663
Well, l want half,

01:02:30.737 --> 01:02:34.503
$20,000 a week,
or you're dead !

01:02:34.574 --> 01:02:36.735
You understand ?

01:02:36.809 --> 01:02:41.178
Twenty thousand seems fair.
That seems fair, right guys ? lt's fair.

01:02:41.247 --> 01:02:43.841
Class dismissed.

01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:48.682
Man, we are
in trouble, man.

01:02:52.558 --> 01:02:58.394
Jerry, l really need
your help, man. Feel us--

01:02:58.464 --> 01:03:02.833
Brian, will you stop praying to
a bag of sand, man ? Come on.

01:03:04.504 --> 01:03:09.032
You heard the man. lf we don't
get this money, we're dead. All of us !

01:03:12.211 --> 01:03:16.204
Yo, Thurgood, why don't you get your
boy, The Guy, to lend you some money ?

01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:19.843
- You certainly let him
stay here long enough.
- Man, that's Brian's boy.

01:03:19.919 --> 01:03:23.878
- l didn't let him stay here.
- l don't know him, man.

01:03:29.729 --> 01:03:32.596
- Hey, what day is it ?
- Saturday.

01:03:32.665 --> 01:03:34.599
- 
- ls it January ?

01:03:34.667 --> 01:03:37.431
No, man, it's August.

01:03:37.503 --> 01:03:40.438
Oh, wow. August.

01:03:40.506 --> 01:03:43.270
- 
- Hey, l couldn't help
overhearing you guys.

01:03:43.343 --> 01:03:48.110
You know, if you want to double
your profits, you should rob that lab.

01:03:48.181 --> 01:03:50.479
Tomorrow's Sunday.
There'll be no one in there.

01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:53.519
Just go in and rob
the place blind.

01:03:53.586 --> 01:03:55.520
lt'll work, l promise you.

01:03:58.358 --> 01:04:01.759
Hey, uh, seein' as how
we don't know who you are,

01:04:01.828 --> 01:04:04.922
are you plannin'
on movin' out anytime soon ?

01:04:04.998 --> 01:04:09.025
Thurgood, why don't you just
focus on one thing at a time ?

01:04:09.102 --> 01:04:13.368
l'll be fine. The robbery
is what's important now.

01:04:51.677 --> 01:04:53.611
Phase One is complete, yo.

01:04:53.679 --> 01:04:55.977
- 
-  All right.

01:04:56.049 --> 01:04:59.644
Now all we gotta do is go down this
hatch to the second-floor supply room.

01:04:59.719 --> 01:05:02.552
Grab all the weed you can grab,
and we are outta here !

01:05:02.622 --> 01:05:04.556
Sick, man !
This is it ?

01:05:04.624 --> 01:05:06.558
Let's do it.

01:05:06.626 --> 01:05:08.560
Watch your step.

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:21.067
- You didn't say nothin'
about no door, yo.
- Chill out, man.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.906
l smoke weed here all the time.
This door's never locked.

01:05:24.977 --> 01:05:27.502
- 
- l didn't say the alarm would be off.

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:30.674
- l said it never locked.
- Well, hurry, yo !

01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:33.014
You guys, wait up !

01:05:35.288 --> 01:05:37.222
Oh.

01:05:37.290 --> 01:05:39.588
- 
- Hold up !

01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:43.959
- lsn't that Thurgood, the custodian ?
- Yeah.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:48.364
- Want me to call the cops ?
- No. This is too much fun.

01:05:48.434 --> 01:05:50.629
Right over here !
Come on !

01:05:56.642 --> 01:05:58.576
l hope there's some left.

01:06:12.892 --> 01:06:16.726
Maui Wowie !

01:06:31.110 --> 01:06:34.511
l never seen this much weed
in my life ! Let's go !

01:06:38.751 --> 01:06:40.981
- Come on, man !
- 

01:06:55.234 --> 01:06:59.034
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head.

01:06:59.105 --> 01:07:02.563
Yo, l'm gonna make
a run for it, B.

01:07:02.642 --> 01:07:04.610
Just get down, man.

01:07:08.147 --> 01:07:10.445
At least Brian
got away, yo.

01:07:10.516 --> 01:07:15.510
Whoa ! My nads ! Oh !

01:07:16.923 --> 01:07:19.619
Hey, thank God, man !

01:07:19.692 --> 01:07:22.786
Get down on your knees with
your hands behind your head !

01:07:24.363 --> 01:07:26.297
Move in.

01:07:29.635 --> 01:07:32.069
Breaking and entering.

01:07:32.138 --> 01:07:34.106
You got me ?
Open and shut.

01:07:34.173 --> 01:07:36.801
l say we book 'em.
You got me ? We book 'em.

01:07:36.876 --> 01:07:40.812
Hey, wait a minute, guys.

01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:44.714
lt's not open and shut.
What do you guys do for a living ?

01:07:44.784 --> 01:07:47.275
- l'm a detective.
- Yeah, we're detectives.

01:07:47.353 --> 01:07:50.811
Oh. Okay then, detect.
Ask us somethin'.

01:07:50.890 --> 01:07:55.224
- What do you know about this
new Jamaican, this Mr. Nice Guy ?
- Yeah.

01:07:55.294 --> 01:07:58.457
Aw, shit, yo.

01:07:58.531 --> 01:08:03.025
Well, l heard he's got great weed,
but that's neither here nor there.

01:08:03.102 --> 01:08:06.128
- l mean, we can't bring him down.
- Crazy.

01:08:06.205 --> 01:08:08.673
But we can
bring you Samson.

01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:12.336
Just ask me how. Ask me !

01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:15.278
How are you gonna
bring Samson down ?

01:08:15.348 --> 01:08:18.374
We got a meeting with him
in a couple days.

01:08:18.451 --> 01:08:20.612
l'll wear a wire. Hmm ?

01:08:20.685 --> 01:08:24.850
All right, listen to me.
There's $30,000 in this knapsack.

01:08:24.924 --> 01:08:27.358
When you get in there,
give him the 20 grand you owe him,

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:30.486
and with the remaining ten,
buy whatever narcotics he's got around.

01:08:30.563 --> 01:08:33.794
You got me ?
You paying attention ?

01:08:33.866 --> 01:08:36.663
No. Sorry, man.

01:08:36.736 --> 01:08:39.899
Unless you say out loud what it
is you're buying, we got nothin'.

01:08:39.971 --> 01:08:43.738
So make sure that you say it, and make
sure that you get Samson to say it.

01:08:43.809 --> 01:08:45.743
- No codes. No slang.
- Yeah.

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:50.145
As soon as you got the stuff,
or if anything goes wrong,
say the phrase, ''Abracadabra.''

01:08:50.216 --> 01:08:53.310
- Abracadabra.
- Abracadabra ?

01:08:54.886 --> 01:08:58.152
- Okay. Okay.
- Make sure that you are relaxed.

01:08:58.224 --> 01:09:00.158
And just act
completely normal.

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:02.990
- That's gonna be a problem.
- What do you mean ?

01:09:03.062 --> 01:09:06.520
l mean we haven't smoked
any weed today, man.

01:09:06.599 --> 01:09:11.969
lf the three of us go in there
all clear-eyed, Samson
is gonna know somethin's up.

01:09:14.473 --> 01:09:16.907
Well, if you think
it's gonna help.

01:09:16.975 --> 01:09:20.002
Yeah. Yeah, l think that's
gonna help. You got a light ?

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.716
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:09:27.787 --> 01:09:30.620
- 
- Thanks, Officer.

01:09:35.461 --> 01:09:37.486
l just wanna say,

01:09:37.563 --> 01:09:41.522
that was a great idea,
Thurgood.

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:46.401
- Wow. l mean, where do you even--
- Just smoke it, yo !

01:09:48.006 --> 01:09:50.270
lf somethin' happens to us,
could you--

01:09:50.343 --> 01:09:53.710
could you give this letter
to Mary Jane Potman ?

01:09:53.779 --> 01:09:55.747
Sure thing, kid.

01:09:55.815 --> 01:10:01.515
And-- And tell our friend Kenny Davis
we love him. He's in prison.

01:10:01.587 --> 01:10:04.579
- Let's go. Come on.
- All right. Let's move.

01:10:05.958 --> 01:10:08.017
Just remember to speak clearly.

01:10:08.094 --> 01:10:10.756
- Get him to say what he's sellin' you.
- Yeah.

01:10:10.830 --> 01:10:12.764
lt ain't always good...

01:10:12.832 --> 01:10:15.960
to get high before you have
important things to do.

01:10:16.035 --> 01:10:20.802
Lucky for us,
the cops had our backs.

01:10:20.873 --> 01:10:24.832
- Hello, boys.
- Hi, Samson.

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:28.812
So... where's the money ?

01:10:28.881 --> 01:10:30.815
Right here in my bag.

01:10:30.883 --> 01:10:34.011
Um, Samson, can l
ask you a question ?

01:10:34.086 --> 01:10:36.384
Go ahead.

01:10:36.455 --> 01:10:40.323
Do you know where we can score
some cocaine ?

01:10:40.393 --> 01:10:44.056
- You want some candy ?
- Uh, no, thanks.

01:10:44.130 --> 01:10:48.726
But it'd be great
if we can get some cocaine.

01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:52.237
- 
- What's so funny ?

01:10:52.304 --> 01:10:54.772
Those guys--
Those guys are doomed !

01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:57.331
l can't feel my hands !

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:59.344
l-- l can feel them.

01:11:03.349 --> 01:11:05.840
What we have here...

01:11:05.918 --> 01:11:08.011
is some Columbian heaven.

01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:10.214
Pure cocaine.

01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:13.725
- Candy makes you dandy.
- Hmm.

01:11:13.793 --> 01:11:17.627
This is all the cocaine
we get for ten G's, B ?

01:11:17.696 --> 01:11:20.358
- We have other product.
- Oh, like more cocaine ?

01:11:22.501 --> 01:11:24.628
And that is ?

01:11:24.703 --> 01:11:28.969
Fine China. Babaloo.

01:11:29.041 --> 01:11:32.841
- Looks like heroin to me, yo.
- Yeah. ls that heroin ?

01:11:32.912 --> 01:11:36.473
You've got to be the dumbest dealers
in the history of the dope game.

01:11:36.549 --> 01:11:39.985
You mean the game
that you run, yo ?

01:11:40.052 --> 01:11:42.714
- Good.
- Just call me Jesse Owens.

01:11:42.788 --> 01:11:45.757
Jesse, can we get some cocaine
and get the hell outta here ?

01:11:45.825 --> 01:11:49.852
- Okay.
- Can l buy some of your heroin too ?

01:11:49.929 --> 01:11:52.955
- Okay.
- 

01:11:53.032 --> 01:11:55.125
All right. All right.

01:11:55.201 --> 01:11:57.601
lt's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.639
Thank you very much for the heroin
and the cocaine. Here's your money.

01:12:00.706 --> 01:12:02.367
All right.

01:12:04.643 --> 01:12:06.577
Abracadabra.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.814
Yeah, man !

01:12:11.984 --> 01:12:14.817
Abracadabra.

01:12:18.357 --> 01:12:21.190
''You're all the Mary Jane
l'll ever need.''

01:12:24.597 --> 01:12:28.465
- Abracadabra, yo !
- Oh, abracadabra, man.

01:12:28.534 --> 01:12:33.028
- Abracadabra.
- Boy, why do you keep saying that ?

01:12:33.105 --> 01:12:35.630
What ? Abracadabra ?

01:12:35.708 --> 01:12:37.972
Yes. Abracadabra.

01:12:38.043 --> 01:12:41.012
lt's the latest thing.
All the kids are saying it, all right ?

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.640
- Abracadabra, my brother.
- What's up ? Abracadabra.

01:12:43.716 --> 01:12:47.277
- Abracadabra.
- Slim, take off your shirt.

01:12:48.354 --> 01:12:51.619
Samson, Samson,
l hardly know you.

01:12:51.690 --> 01:12:53.988
- Ladies.
-  Abracadabra.

01:12:54.059 --> 01:12:56.220
- Abracadabra, man !
- Abracadabra, yo !

01:12:56.295 --> 01:12:59.059
Abracadabra ! Abra--

01:12:59.131 --> 01:13:03.534
You're dead ! All of you !

01:13:03.602 --> 01:13:06.696
Hey, fellas,
let's beat these bitches !

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:36.267
Let's work it out.

01:13:42.508 --> 01:13:45.272
Oh, yo, your titty.

01:13:47.479 --> 01:13:50.937
- Now, that's a titty.
- Fully, man.

01:13:51.016 --> 01:13:54.179
That is an official fully.

01:13:54.253 --> 01:13:56.084
Aah !

01:14:00.893 --> 01:14:06.024
-These are mean people. Mean, mean, man.
-Look out !

01:14:11.837 --> 01:14:14.670
This is for Killer, B.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:19.177
- 
- Surprise, surprise, surprise.

01:14:19.244 --> 01:14:21.212
Look who's walkin'.

01:14:22.581 --> 01:14:24.708
Nigger, l thought
you said you was crippled.

01:14:24.783 --> 01:14:28.947
Well, sweet pea,
we're all crippled in some way.

01:14:29.021 --> 01:14:31.990
- Put it down !
- You win.

01:14:32.057 --> 01:14:33.991
Now...

01:14:34.059 --> 01:14:37.392
this is the way
it's gonna work.

01:14:37.463 --> 01:14:40.398
l'm gonna take your little
Mexican friend with me,

01:14:40.466 --> 01:14:42.400
and l'm gonna kill him.

01:14:42.468 --> 01:14:45.494
- l'm Cuban, B.
- Yes, Cuban B.

01:14:45.571 --> 01:14:50.736
- Now is there anything you want
to say to your friends ?
- Jerry, we need you.

01:14:50.809 --> 01:14:53.403
Abracadabra, B !

01:14:58.217 --> 01:15:01.653
Oh, man !

01:15:03.989 --> 01:15:06.753
Oh, wow.

01:15:08.427 --> 01:15:11.828
Sucks to be you, man !

01:15:13.599 --> 01:15:16.227
Oh, man ! Oh, man !

01:15:16.301 --> 01:15:20.601
What did l--
l told you he was real, man.

01:15:20.673 --> 01:15:24.734
Jerry... thank you, man.

01:15:24.810 --> 01:15:26.778
You're welcome, Brian.

01:15:26.845 --> 01:15:29.370
Peace.

01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:39.389
- Well, abracadabra.
- Whoa !

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:42.586
- All right.
- What the hell's goin' on here ?

01:15:42.661 --> 01:15:47.098
- Our job is done.
These guys can go home.
- You guys are wasted, man.

01:15:47.166 --> 01:15:50.533
Thurgood, Thurgood.
Nice letter.

01:15:50.602 --> 01:15:53.503
- Gimme that back.
- Queer.

01:15:59.344 --> 01:16:01.312
- Everybody, freeze !
- Oh, shit !

01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.314
Nobody move !

01:16:06.118 --> 01:16:10.282
 The cops took all
the credit for bustin' Samson,
but that's not important.

01:16:10.355 --> 01:16:14.382
What was important is that we cut
a deal, and Kenny was finally free.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.395
- Hallelujah !
-  

01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:21.690
Which brings me
to the Brooklyn Bridge,

01:16:21.767 --> 01:16:24.497
where l had to make things right
with Mary Jane.

01:16:27.606 --> 01:16:31.440
- Hi.
- Are you ?

01:16:31.510 --> 01:16:33.671
A little bit from yesterday,
you know, when Kenny got--

01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:38.615
But-But-But, Mary Jane, listen.
l'm done. l'm done sellin' it.

01:16:38.684 --> 01:16:41.847
l'm done smokin' it.
This is the last of it, right here.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.583
l just wanted you to see me
get rid of it.

01:16:47.426 --> 01:16:49.860
Could we just have a--
a moment alone ?

01:16:52.164 --> 01:16:55.292
Do what you gotta do.
Be strong.

01:16:55.367 --> 01:16:57.301
Thanks, baby.

01:17:00.439 --> 01:17:02.430
Mary Jane,

01:17:02.508 --> 01:17:06.706
bein' with you these past
11 years has been wonderful.

01:17:06.779 --> 01:17:08.713
But l gotta move on.

01:17:08.781 --> 01:17:13.047
Come on. Smoke me.
Have a quickie for old time's sake.

01:17:13.118 --> 01:17:16.281
No. She's looking.

01:17:16.355 --> 01:17:19.051
She's looking.
All right. Real quick.

01:17:22.194 --> 01:17:25.391
No. No ! lt wouldn't be right.

01:17:25.464 --> 01:17:27.830
Goddamn you !

01:17:30.569 --> 01:17:33.299
You'll be back !

01:17:34.373 --> 01:17:36.307
Everything work out okay ?

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:39.606
Yeah. Mary Jane, l love you.

01:17:39.678 --> 01:17:41.612
l love you too.

01:17:45.984 --> 01:17:49.476
 l know.
l know what you're thinkin'.

01:17:49.555 --> 01:17:53.616
- That old Thurgood sold out, right ?
- l'm your girl now.

01:17:53.692 --> 01:17:58.095
But let me tell you something.
l love weed, okay ? l love it.

01:17:59.498 --> 01:18:03.457
But not as much
as l love pussy.

01:18:03.535 --> 01:18:05.469
The End.

 We're alone 

01:18:32.698 --> 01:18:36.657
 Now l can tell ya, girl 

01:18:36.735 --> 01:18:38.669
