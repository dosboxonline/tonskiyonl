WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.471
You can't bring
the Covenant here.

00:03.571 --> 00:04.772
They will annihilate humankind.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.107
And if the humans control it,

00:06.207 --> 00:07.608
they'll annihilate
the Covenant.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.410
We could build a world here.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.114
[shockwave]

00:13.214 --> 00:14.848
[roars]

00:15.849 --> 00:17.151
You stood for me.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.152
[screams]

00:18.252 --> 00:21.055
I am bound to you.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.790
We are bound to the Ring.

00:22.890 --> 00:26.394
[Arbiter] They will send the
entire fleet to hunt us down.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.262
Ready the Spartan-IIIs.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.798
[Kai] Infiltrate the ship,
deliver the Spike.

00:30.898 --> 00:33.067
-The Spike delivers a virus.
-Initiate.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.768
[Ackerson] It doesn't do
what we told them.

00:34.868 --> 00:37.305
The virus compresses
the ship's fusion drive,

00:37.405 --> 00:38.739
- creating a reaction...
- [Kai] What?

00:38.839 --> 00:40.408
powerful enough
to incinerate everything.

00:40.508 --> 00:43.311
Their fleet, our fleet,
perhaps even the Halo itself.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.146
Parangosky's throwing
Spartan-IIIs

00:45.246 --> 00:47.415
at the Covenant fleet
because she doesn't need

00:47.515 --> 00:48.516
all of them to make it.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.184
She just needs one.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.585
[Perez]
You know what it would mean

00:51.685 --> 00:53.154
to them to see you're alive.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.156
To know you're fighting
beside them.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.291
It meant something,
being a Spartan.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.327
You are not a Spartan.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.596
You have a marriage.
You have a son.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.465
-Soren!
-[Soren] Kessler!

01:04.565 --> 01:06.134
[Kessler] Dad!

01:06.234 --> 01:08.836
[Halsey] Whoever designed
this complex built the Halo.

01:08.936 --> 01:11.672
-[Kwan] What is this place?
-[Miranda] It's a laboratory.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.208
-There's something in its hand.
-It's spreading.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.444
[The Mother]
It's close now, the monster.

01:16.544 --> 01:18.112
Find me, deliver me, save me.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.914
-It's real.
-[Halsey] Tell me you got it.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.951
[Kai] We're talking
about an entire fleet.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.886
I'm talking about
the end of everything.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.888
Just get to the Halo.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.525
[engine roaring]

01:31.625 --> 01:33.461
-[plasma fire]
-[rumbling]

01:34.262 --> 01:36.063
[Kai] First squad,
on the beam!

01:37.298 --> 01:39.433
[dramatic music playing]

01:44.738 --> 01:46.039
[screams]

01:46.140 --> 01:47.475
No!

01:47.575 --> 01:49.676
[dramatic music continues]

01:50.777 --> 01:51.945
[grunts]

01:53.314 --> 01:55.649
[quiet music]

01:55.749 --> 01:57.050
[gasps softly]

01:57.151 --> 02:00.521
[dramatic music swells,
subsides]

02:04.692 --> 02:07.328
[John] What the hell happened
down there?

02:08.662 --> 02:10.997
[unknown voice]
Death, but not yours.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.402
What is that thing?

02:14.502 --> 02:16.770
-Why is it here?
-[voice] I'm afraid

02:16.870 --> 02:18.839
you'll have to be
more specific.

02:19.607 --> 02:22.510
This facility is vast,
unknowable.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.746
Except by me, of course.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.049
Dark places
contain dark things.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.321
What did you find down there?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.398
[dramatic music playing]

02:57.511 --> 02:58.446
[Miranda gasps]

02:58.546 --> 03:00.314
[indistinct P.A. announcement]

03:00.414 --> 03:03.617
[door opens]

03:03.717 --> 03:06.153
I thought you said these spores
were dormant.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.988
They were.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.258
Some spores remain dormant
for millions of years

03:10.358 --> 03:12.092
before they activate.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.627
What woke these up?

03:13.727 --> 03:15.228
Could be anything.

03:15.728 --> 03:19.132
Temperature, light, pH level,

03:19.233 --> 03:22.836
electric stimulus,
the presence of a food source.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.073
Are you really
Catherine Halsey's daughter?

03:28.108 --> 03:29.543
It's just that...

03:30.411 --> 03:32.380
biology isn't exactly
your strong suit.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.149
You know, I heard someone say
they saw her here.

03:36.250 --> 03:38.252
-Halsey.
-I doubt that.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.488
[Janine] Your mother's
why I became a biologist.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.256
-Really?
-And I don't believe

03:42.356 --> 03:44.325
everything they say about her.

03:44.425 --> 03:45.859
You really should.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.629
[Janine] I can't believe
you were the one who found it.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.231
I suppose it pays
to be lucky sometimes.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.301
[Miranda] What?

03:56.304 --> 03:57.871
Fascinating.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.174
Were you in here earlier?

04:01.275 --> 04:02.610
I don't think so.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.944
So you didn't touch that?

04:04.044 --> 04:05.679
-What is it?
-Did you touch it or not?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.581
No, of course not.

04:09.483 --> 04:11.685
They sent another wave
of Spartans.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.754
That can't be good, right?

04:14.722 --> 04:16.356
The battle must not
be going very well.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.358
-Listen, Jeanie--
-Janine.

04:18.459 --> 04:19.560
Yeah, right. I really...

04:19.660 --> 04:22.162
I really gotta focus
on this, so...

04:23.597 --> 04:24.932
If you don't mind.

04:28.636 --> 04:33.974
[lighthearted music rises]

04:41.615 --> 04:42.582
Hi.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.353
[lighthearted music playing]

04:47.655 --> 04:51.459
[cell parting]

04:52.326 --> 04:54.027
...so hard he ends up
spinning himself

04:54.127 --> 04:55.763
and falling in the water,
and my dad's like...

04:56.664 --> 04:59.266
my father says, "Of course. Why
don't we go out onto the lake?"

04:59.367 --> 05:02.102
[continues indistinct]

05:03.003 --> 05:04.705
[scientist] Janine?

05:04.805 --> 05:05.939
Hey, Janine?

05:07.475 --> 05:08.742
Sorry.

05:08.842 --> 05:12.680
[lighthearted music continues]

05:12.780 --> 05:15.583
It's just stunning.
It's like...

05:15.683 --> 05:17.084
[indistinct chatter continues]

05:17.184 --> 05:18.786
[music twists and distorts]

05:18.886 --> 05:20.220
[gasps softly]

05:22.890 --> 05:25.025
[lighthearted music returns]

05:29.029 --> 05:32.199
[cells parting]

05:33.534 --> 05:34.968
[scientist, muted] Janine?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.873
Is something wrong?

05:45.746 --> 05:46.947
[scientist] Janine!

05:47.047 --> 05:49.650
[dramatic music playing]

05:52.886 --> 05:54.722
[indistinct chatter]

05:54.822 --> 06:00.394

06:00.494 --> 06:01.995
What are you?

06:13.741 --> 06:19.112
[opening theme music plays]

07:11.431 --> 07:15.202
[indistinct radio chatter]

[Perez whispering prayer
in Spanish]

07:22.409 --> 07:24.578
[Perez breathing heavily]

07:26.079 --> 07:28.482
[continues praying in Spanish]

07:32.419 --> 07:35.823
[Kai]
Perez. Trust your training.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.093
[indistinct voices over comms]

07:40.994 --> 07:42.763
[Flightdeck, over comms]
First squad, stand by!

07:42.863 --> 07:45.098
[Kai]
Watch your spacing.

07:45.198 --> 07:49.236
Maintain formation.
This is what we trained for--

07:49.336 --> 07:52.405
[explosions]

07:52.506 --> 07:54.742
[silence]

07:54.842 --> 07:57.745
-[gasping and panting]
-[panicked screaming over comms]

07:57.845 --> 07:59.913
[Perez]
Oh my God. Oh my God.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.348
[Kai over comms]
Calm down.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.217
-Kai!
-[Kai] You're in gimbal lock.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.219
Kai!

[panting and gasping]

08:12.693 --> 08:14.728
[distorted voices over comms]

08:14.828 --> 08:16.029
[Kai] Find your reference...

08:16.129 --> 08:17.097
Kai...

08:17.197 --> 08:18.465
[whimpering and panting]

08:18.566 --> 08:20.668
[thrusters engage sporadically]

[gasps]

08:32.245 --> 08:34.147
[thrusters stabilize]

08:37.751 --> 08:40.220
[Perez] Javelin leader,
this is Javelin-4.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.956
Approaching formation.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.457
[Kai] Hold your line.

08:44.558 --> 08:45.759
[Mullins] Heads up.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.928
Debris!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.063
[Kai] That's not debris.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.365
[Kai]
That's the second wave.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.068
Stay in formation!

08:56.369 --> 08:57.304
[Kai grunting]

Spot your landing.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.753
You're coming in too hot.

09:22.930 --> 09:23.997
[Mullins] Can't believe there's
not-

09:24.097 --> 09:25.599
[Kai] Stay close.
- a hole in me somewhere.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.237
[Perez]
Oh my God.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.341
Holy shit.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.943
[Mullins] What are we supposed
to do about that?

09:36.043 --> 09:37.778
[Kai]
The objective hasn't changed.

09:37.878 --> 09:41.048
Round up anyone who can fight.
We'll rally at the breach point.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.382
[Perez] What breach point?

09:42.482 --> 09:44.317
[Kai] There.

[panicked screaming over radio]

09:58.231 --> 10:01.301
[Parangosky] Master Chief,
this is Admiral Parangosky.

10:01.401 --> 10:04.972
I speak for the entire UNSC
when I say how glad I am

10:05.072 --> 10:06.439
that you're back with us.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.178
Master Chief, do you copy?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.312
[button beeps]

10:13.013 --> 10:15.348
[John]
What do you want?

10:15.448 --> 10:16.984
We are tracking
the Covenant Fleet

10:17.084 --> 10:19.519
in pursuit of a single vessel
bound for the Halo.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.990
It is of critical importance
that you reach the Halo first.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.258
[John]
I'm done taking orders from you.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.394
[Parangosky]
You don't do this for me.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.697
You do this for humanity.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.065
Neither one of us has a choice.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.001
Assault force is getting torn up
out here.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.569
The Fleet is inbound.
Focus on the Halo.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.673
The Spartan-IIIs have
their mission, you have yours.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.809
So you've already decided.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.846
Bad copy. 117, say again?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.182
[John] Who to save
and who to sacrifice.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.454
The Spartan-IIIs volunteered
to make a difference.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.956
If you don't control the Halo,

10:56.056 --> 10:58.125
-the enemy will--
-[radio beeps off]

10:59.693 --> 11:00.961
Master Chief?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.562
[tech 1]
He's cut comms, Admiral.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.831
[tech 2]
He's out.

11:06.366 --> 11:10.170
[soft, shaky breathing]

11:12.539 --> 11:14.541
[objects clattering]

11:17.044 --> 11:18.511
Run.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.647
We have to leave this place.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.250
That's the plan.

11:27.921 --> 11:31.124
My father used to talk
about the darkness.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.261
I said I didn't believe him,
but that was a lie.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.865
I could feel it watching me.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.401
It's been watching me my whole
life, and now it's here.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.105
The monster.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
Laera and Kessler...

11:54.047 --> 11:55.915
they're in that place.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.020
You don't have to come.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.092
[cell door closes]

12:13.033 --> 12:14.334
What are you in for?

12:14.434 --> 12:17.337
-Are you a bad man?
-Why would you think that?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.940
-You're in jail.
-So are you.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.541
[Laera] Kessler.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.011
-Stop talking to that man.
-He was talking to me.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.446
I'm not gonna tell you again.
Get away from there.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.816
[Kessler]
Where am I supposed to go?

12:31.618 --> 12:32.820
Hi.

12:35.122 --> 12:36.689
[Kessler]
Hey, you okay?

12:36.790 --> 12:39.026
[Laera]
Kessler, what did I just say?

12:39.126 --> 12:40.593
[Kessler] Hello?

12:42.963 --> 12:47.300
Kessler, stop bothering people.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.238
I think she's sad.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.842
[Laera] Come over here.
No more talking.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.110
Come on.

12:58.979 --> 13:05.152
[eerie music rises]

Bridge. Forty meters.

They jumped with the first wave.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.505
[Kai] Eyes on this corner.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.140
[Olsson] I've got it, ma'am.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.109
[heavy breathing]

14:07.514 --> 14:08.815
Kai.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.051
-[Kai] Break contact!
-[chaotic comms crosstalk]

14:11.151 --> 14:15.388
-[gunfire]
-[indistinct shouting]

14:15.488 --> 14:17.490
[Perez]
Farhadi, I got you! Get up!

14:18.158 --> 14:21.361
-This corridor! On me!
-[shouting continues]

14:23.163 --> 14:24.998
[Perez]
They were waiting for us!

14:25.498 --> 14:27.067
[Kai] They learned
from the first wave.

14:27.167 --> 14:30.370
[Mullins] Great, they know our
goddamn plan better than we do.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.572
[Kai] Hold fire.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.107
[gunfire stops]

14:35.842 --> 14:37.344
[Mullins] Where are they?

14:37.444 --> 14:38.545
[Perez] Quiet.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.350
Contact!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.418
[groaning]

14:45.518 --> 14:47.520
[snarls and roars]

14:47.620 --> 14:49.756
[Perez] Move! Move!

14:49.856 --> 14:51.290
[Perez] Frag out!

14:52.159 --> 14:53.793
[Kai]
We gotta hold this corridor!

14:53.893 --> 14:55.095
Pick your targets!

14:55.195 --> 14:56.696
[indistinct shouting]

14:56.796 --> 14:58.798
[Kai]
Make your rounds count!

15:01.201 --> 15:02.869
[comms]
Take him out!

15:02.970 --> 15:05.705
[comms]
Spartan down! Cover me!

15:05.805 --> 15:07.440
[Sangheili roaring]

15:07.540 --> 15:08.741
[cruiser comms officer]
Overlord, this is

15:08.841 --> 15:09.709
UNSC Halcyon Cruiser Himalaya.

15:09.809 --> 15:11.044
Exiting slip now.

15:11.144 --> 15:12.379
[Mullins] It's the Fleet!

15:12.479 --> 15:13.981
[Perez] About time!

15:14.982 --> 15:17.217
[Kai] UNSC Halcyon Cruiser,
this is Kai-125.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.787
We are aboard a Covenant
Corvette, Vector 1.9.4.2.2.

15:20.887 --> 15:22.422
We are low on ammo.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.391
Requesting resupply and casevac.

15:24.491 --> 15:27.794
[cruiser comms officer]
Copy that, 125. Coming about.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.929
Will dispatch support
to your position, stand by--

15:30.030 --> 15:31.231
[plasma explosion]

15:32.432 --> 15:35.002
[indistinct voices shouting]

15:35.102 --> 15:37.137
[Mullins] Oh, no. Shit.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.139
[Kai] Right flank, frag out!

15:39.239 --> 15:40.974
You gonna help them or what?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.843
[Parangosky] The Spartans-IIIs
are fighting to buy you time.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.678
If you don't get to the Halo,

15:45.778 --> 15:48.081
all these sacrifices
will be for nothing.

15:48.181 --> 15:50.283
There's nothing
anyone can do for them--

15:50.383 --> 15:51.784
[radio beeps off]

15:52.919 --> 15:54.154
[Kai] We gotta move.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.656
All UNSC Fleet units,
this is Kai-125...

15:56.756 --> 15:58.391
[Perez, voiceover]
I watched you.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.427
All that plasma flying.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.830
Death all around you,
and you never...

16:03.930 --> 16:05.765
[John]
Every time I go into battle,

16:05.865 --> 16:07.434
I know I can lose somebody.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.502
I know it's not gonna be me.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.504
[Perez]
It's something you are.

16:11.604 --> 16:16.176
Something you can't see.
But you feel it.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.777
I know you feel it.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.482
That woman made you flip
that coin all those times.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.752
How did you choose me?

16:27.087 --> 16:30.023
-Heads.
-Eleven times in a row.

16:30.123 --> 16:31.924
[Perez]
Was it luck?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.427
Or did you make it
come up heads?

16:36.396 --> 16:37.864
[John] Why me?

16:37.964 --> 16:41.668
[dramatic music rises]

16:41.768 --> 16:43.703
[suspenseful music playing]

16:43.803 --> 16:46.506
[coin ringing and flipping]

16:50.510 --> 16:54.314
[coin slows and whooshes]

16:54.414 --> 16:55.548
-[explosions]
-[Kai] Fall back!

16:55.648 --> 16:56.915
We can still make it
to the bridge!

16:57.016 --> 16:58.918
[all shouting indistinctly]

16:59.018 --> 17:01.721
-[explosions]
-[Sangheili roaring]

17:01.821 --> 17:03.790
[dramatic music playing]

17:04.691 --> 17:07.894
[Parangosky] Master Chief,
why have you stopped?

17:07.993 --> 17:09.896
Get back to the cockpit now.

17:09.996 --> 17:13.233
You know your mission.
Secure the Ring. Defend it.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.335
John, you can't save them.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.305
You have no idea what I can do.

17:20.207 --> 17:26.445
[heroic music playing]

17:31.184 --> 17:33.420
[Cortana] Would you like to hear
my analysis

17:33.520 --> 17:35.021
of the hull's integrity?

17:35.122 --> 17:36.289
No.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.391
If we continue to take fire
at this rate,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.593
we'll disintegrate
before reaching the surface.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.795
Do you think I would come all
this way, suffer all this time,

17:42.895 --> 17:44.764
just to die within sight of it?

17:44.864 --> 17:48.201
I'm merely suggesting
we get to a drop pod.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.672
Will he come?

17:54.707 --> 17:56.276
You simulate everything.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.678
Any question I ask, you answer.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.250
But not about him.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.018
I can't.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.457
-You're loyal.
-Am I?

18:10.557 --> 18:12.859
-It's a virtue.
-Thank you.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.362
And a problem.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.998
Now tell me,
what will I do next?

18:20.400 --> 18:21.801
I can only conclude

18:21.901 --> 18:24.871
that if my loyalty
to Master Chief is a problem,

18:25.738 --> 18:27.640
then your loyalty
must lie elsewhere.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.476
I'm no one's pet.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.244
I belong to no one.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.514
So, tell me...

18:36.183 --> 18:37.550
what will I do now?

18:39.419 --> 18:41.288
You're going to erase me.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.192
You've been of great aid to me.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.263
-I thought we were the same.
-We are.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.433
We both see the future.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.102
-Wait.
-[electricity crackles]

19:01.474 --> 19:03.676
-[Rossi] Go! Go! Go!
-[gunfire]

19:03.776 --> 19:05.178
[Mullins] Last mag!

19:05.278 --> 19:07.514
-[Rossi] Covering you!
-[Perez] Go! Go! Go!

19:07.614 --> 19:09.148
[Perez]
Goddamn it!

19:09.249 --> 19:11.451
We're gonna die in this bullshit
ship in a bullshit battle

19:11.551 --> 19:13.186
that meant nothing,
that we lost!

19:13.286 --> 19:15.722
-[Kai] Suppress that corner!
-[Okada] I'm out!

19:16.656 --> 19:18.958
[Perez shouting in Spanish]

19:20.126 --> 19:22.962
[Kai] What matters is
you signed up to die for me.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.898
I signed up to die for you.
Now, get your head in the game.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.534
[Perez] I'm good!

19:27.634 --> 19:29.702
[Kai] Shit, I'm out.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.371
[Perez] Yeah, me too.
What do we do?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.739
[Kai] You ever fire
a plasma rifle?

19:32.839 --> 19:33.973
[Perez] No.

19:34.073 --> 19:36.042
[Kai]
You never forget your first.

19:36.142 --> 19:37.477
[grunts]

19:39.812 --> 19:41.681
[snarls]

19:41.781 --> 19:43.283
[plasma fire]

19:44.917 --> 19:46.185
[all shouting]

19:46.286 --> 19:48.755
-[Kai] Defensive positions!
-[Perez screams]

19:48.855 --> 19:50.189
[Kai] Perez!

19:53.826 --> 19:55.194
[grunting]

19:57.029 --> 19:59.332
[indistinct shouting]

19:59.432 --> 20:00.833
[screams]

20:00.933 --> 20:02.369
[needler fire]

20:04.003 --> 20:06.038
[Okada] Inside!
They're inside!

20:08.341 --> 20:10.142
[Perez grunts]

20:11.511 --> 20:13.012
[Kai] You're an idiot.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.448
[Perez]
I'm an idiot with two needlers.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.652
[Perez gasps in pain]

20:21.888 --> 20:23.623
Help me up.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.224
I can fight.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.131
What can I do?

20:32.965 --> 20:35.668
Tell me what to do.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.306
[Kai] You did good.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.809
[Perez sighs]

20:45.878 --> 20:48.114
[Okada]
They keep coming!

20:48.214 --> 20:50.216
[indistinct shouts]

20:50.317 --> 20:51.784
[Mullins]
Okada's down!

20:51.884 --> 20:54.086
[dramatic music playing]

20:59.326 --> 21:00.893
[Perez] Use it.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.096
[Kai]
You don't know what this does.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.566
[Perez] This was always
a one-way ticket.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.636
Don't let it be for nothing.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.438
[distant gunfire]

21:13.373 --> 21:16.709
[plasma impact]

21:19.579 --> 21:20.847

-[blows landing]
-[Sangheili snarling]

21:36.596 --> 21:38.465
[Mullins]
What the hell is that?

21:45.772 --> 21:47.774
[Kai] That's the Chief.

21:47.874 --> 21:50.109
[heroic music plays]

21:56.248 --> 21:58.117
[screams]

22:02.455 --> 22:04.156
[heroic music continues]

22:19.806 --> 22:21.874
[Kai]
What are you doing here?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.976
I thought you had to save
humanity.

22:24.076 --> 22:27.179
[John]
You're welcome.

22:27.279 --> 22:29.549
-She still breathing?
-[Mullins] I think so.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.718
[John] You need to seal
that suit. Fast.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.153
[Mullins] Okay. I can get her
back to the breach point.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.457
-We can exfil from there.
-[John] Do it. Quickly.

22:43.329 --> 22:45.598
[Kai] This is the most
powerful fleet we have.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.534
They won't last the day.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.503
[John] It's not over.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.442
[Kai]
We're the last of our kind.

22:56.509 --> 22:58.377
Spartans never die.

22:59.846 --> 23:03.015
But they do. Don't they?

23:08.555 --> 23:10.389
[John] Not today.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.825
[Kai] Chief?

23:14.360 --> 23:16.463
[John]
I'm not leaving anyone behind.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.902
-Get to the condors.
-[Mullins] We have to move!

23:25.371 --> 23:27.239
[Perez groaning]

23:28.541 --> 23:30.109
[Mullins] What about you?

23:30.209 --> 23:32.244
[Kai] I'm right behind you.

23:34.447 --> 23:38.851
[distant explosions rumbling]

23:38.951 --> 23:42.955
[dramatic music rises]

23:46.926 --> 23:48.194
Wait.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.068
[Soren] I told you
we got in here too easy.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.144
[faint crackling]

24:05.244 --> 24:07.413
[indistinct liquid sounds]

24:10.583 --> 24:12.318
What's with them?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.255
[faint crackling]

24:22.662 --> 24:24.196
[Kwan]
They're not breathing.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.432
[Soren]
What are you talking about?

24:28.100 --> 24:29.502
Shit.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.972
[muted stretching]

24:33.072 --> 24:34.473
[Kwan] Don't touch them.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.008
[Soren] Don't worry.

24:41.080 --> 24:42.481
[Kwan] This way.

[faint crackling]

Guard! Guard!

25:10.877 --> 25:12.779
-[Laera] What is that thing?
-[Ackerson] Wake up!

25:16.082 --> 25:18.017
[Laera] Oh my God!

25:18.117 --> 25:20.987
Do something!

25:21.087 --> 25:23.222
What's wrong with you? Shoot it!

25:26.926 --> 25:28.527
[gasps]

25:28.628 --> 25:29.962
Hey!

26:12.171 --> 26:13.773
[Soren]
Check over there.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.211
None of these rooms are labeled.

26:19.311 --> 26:20.913
It's just numbers.

26:22.982 --> 26:24.617
Where the hell are they?

26:27.319 --> 26:29.121
[Kwan] Oh, God. Soren.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.824
Soren.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.664
[Laera screaming over monitor]

26:40.667 --> 26:42.702
Come on! Let's go!

26:45.171 --> 26:46.405
[Parangosky] Master Chief,

26:46.505 --> 26:48.174
the Covenant has landed
on the Ring.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.676
What's your status?

26:49.776 --> 26:52.011
John-117, report.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.412
Ma'am, we're no longer reading

26:53.512 --> 26:54.847
Master Chief
on the Covenant ship.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.082
[Parangosky]
What the hell does that mean?

26:56.182 --> 26:57.583
Why have you brought me here?

26:57.684 --> 26:59.919
Tell him to abort this insanity
and get to the Halo.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.689
[voices shouting over comms]

27:05.191 --> 27:07.293
Catherine,
we've had our differences,

27:07.393 --> 27:10.129
but I know you understand
what's at stake.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.164
There is no second place.

27:13.399 --> 27:15.735
[dramatic music playing]

27:15.835 --> 27:17.937
[Halsey, over comms]
John, it's Dr. Halsey.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.605
[John, over comms]
You're back in the room.

27:19.706 --> 27:21.107
That didn't take long.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.909
John, the ship
that you're pursuing,

27:23.009 --> 27:24.376
it's being pulled
into the Halo's gravity.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.477
It's breaking up.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.980
[John]
Yeah, I can see that.

27:31.417 --> 27:35.154
Why is he trying to board
an empty Covenant ship?

27:36.856 --> 27:38.524
[Halsey]
It's not empty.

27:39.558 --> 27:40.693
Not for him.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.830
It's just an AI.
You'll make him another one.

27:45.231 --> 27:47.166
Now get your man back in line.

27:48.067 --> 27:49.235
John...

27:55.241 --> 27:57.476
Your best chance
for a breach point

27:57.576 --> 28:00.980
is three meters
ahead of the starboard engine.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.581
-Copy that?
-[John] Copy.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.117
[Parangosky]
What do you think you're doing?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.222
[voice] I find some
of your choices troubling.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.491
[John]
I get that sometimes.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.326
[voice] You had
a mission. The Ring.

28:14.426 --> 28:15.361
You deviated.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.930
Well, I couldn't just...

28:18.030 --> 28:19.766
I had a responsibility.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.434
[voice] Your
responsibility is to humanity,

28:22.534 --> 28:23.702
not a construct.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.437
Cortana's more than that.

28:27.573 --> 28:29.141
[voice]
Explain.

28:32.144 --> 28:34.246
[John] You wouldn't understand.

28:40.719 --> 28:41.954
She knows me.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.591
[voice] Then perhaps
I should be talking to her.

28:47.659 --> 28:49.628
[dramatic music playing]

29:05.344 --> 29:06.678
[sighs]

29:10.316 --> 29:11.984
[Cortana] Master Chief?

29:13.619 --> 29:14.887
You shouldn't be here.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.388
[John] Where are you?

29:16.488 --> 29:18.490
[Cortana]
I'm in the ship's systems.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.659
I had nowhere else to go.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.661
[John]
I gotta get you out of here.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.031
[Cortana] I've simulated
all of the possible outcomes.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.866
This only ends one way, Chief.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.569
We're both
going to be destroyed.

29:30.669 --> 29:32.004
In seven...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.906
[John]
I'm not gonna let that happen.

29:34.006 --> 29:35.875
[Cortana] I 'm afraid you don't
have a choice in the matter.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.576
- Five...
-[John] Cortana...

29:37.676 --> 29:40.179
-[Cortana] ...four...
-...you don't know everything.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.413
[Cortana] ...three...

29:41.513 --> 29:42.781
two--

29:42.882 --> 29:44.516
[resonant humming]

29:55.661 --> 29:57.229
[hologram beeps]

30:00.199 --> 30:02.935
[Laera, screaming]

30:03.035 --> 30:04.436
Laera!

30:04.536 --> 30:06.672
-[Laera shrieking]
-[Soren] Shit.

30:15.681 --> 30:16.748
Laera.

30:16.849 --> 30:17.884
[gasps]

30:17.984 --> 30:18.985
Don't touch...

30:19.085 --> 30:21.620
whatever the hell that shit is.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.256
Can you get us out of here,
please?

30:24.690 --> 30:26.893
[cell door beeps and buzzes]

30:26.993 --> 30:29.896
-[Kessler] Dad.
-[cell door clanks]

30:36.235 --> 30:38.104
What about him?

30:40.239 --> 30:42.074
You gotta be kidding me.

30:43.242 --> 30:44.676
How have you been?

30:46.012 --> 30:47.246
Let's go.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.881
He saved our lives.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.527
[cell door beeps open]

31:06.132 --> 31:07.733
You have a lovely family.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.869
Stay where I can see you.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.373
Follow me.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.781
[loud explosion]

31:22.881 --> 31:24.616
[grunts]

31:24.716 --> 31:26.618
[panting]

31:42.634 --> 31:45.404
[dramatic music playing]

31:56.348 --> 32:00.686
[Halo theme rises]

32:08.194 --> 32:09.228
It's alive.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.762
[Cortana]
It's the perfect fusion

32:10.862 --> 32:13.599
of artificial intelligence
and organic life.

32:15.201 --> 32:16.502
But yes.

32:17.203 --> 32:20.039
This place is a living network.

32:26.212 --> 32:28.214
Impressive, isn't it?

32:28.314 --> 32:29.881
We need to find Makee.

32:29.982 --> 32:33.585
I don't know everything,
but I'd suggest

32:33.685 --> 32:36.722
looking near the large structure
over there.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.894
[John]
So nice to have you back.

32:42.995 --> 32:44.563
[Cortana] Thank you.

32:53.039 --> 32:55.174
[dramatic music playing]

33:06.885 --> 33:10.856
[Arbiter]
It is as you foretold.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.694
Redemption awaits.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.533
[dramatic music playing]

33:28.907 --> 33:31.477
[Cortana] Whoever built
this place used technology

33:31.577 --> 33:33.745
beyond the limits
of human comprehension.

33:34.580 --> 33:38.217
Do you think it's been waiting
all that time?

33:39.185 --> 33:40.486
[John] For what?

33:40.586 --> 33:42.188
[Cortana] For you.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.925
It all led you here.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.662
Everything you've been through,

33:50.762 --> 33:53.532
every battle you survived.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.434
[John] And Makee.

33:56.302 --> 33:58.770
[Cortana]
Makee believes this is prophecy.

34:02.274 --> 34:05.043
John, why are we here?

34:09.248 --> 34:11.382
[John]
This is where the fight is.

34:17.922 --> 34:20.226
[indistinct voices shouting
faintly over comms]

34:32.471 --> 34:34.206
[groans in pain]

34:37.074 --> 34:38.543
[sighs]

34:43.982 --> 34:45.851
Where's Kai?

34:47.518 --> 34:50.188
[panicked shouting over comms]

34:55.927 --> 34:57.163
[Kai] How hard can it be?

34:57.263 --> 34:59.097
-[fastener tears]
-[grunts]

34:59.198 --> 35:01.833
-Hey, you can't--
-Stop!

35:02.401 --> 35:04.770
[panicked comms crosstalk
continues]

35:06.672 --> 35:08.073
Kai.

35:10.342 --> 35:12.077
[dramatic music playing]

35:12.178 --> 35:14.946
[ship engine powering up]

35:19.751 --> 35:21.820
Ma'am, it appears one of
the Covenant Corvettes

35:21.920 --> 35:23.489
is off course.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.023
What are they doing?

35:27.426 --> 35:29.861
[engine roar intensifies]

35:29.961 --> 35:34.099
[dramatic music playing]

35:38.637 --> 35:39.905
This is gonna hurt.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.446
[massive explosion]

35:47.546 --> 35:49.615
[ship rumbles and shakes]

35:52.117 --> 35:54.986
[quiet music]

36:00.792 --> 36:02.628
[distant explosion]

36:08.267 --> 36:09.801
[Cortana] Chief?

36:18.477 --> 36:21.413
[tech] Confirmed. Assault
Carrier destroyed, Admiral.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.714
We have the upper hand.

36:22.814 --> 36:25.451
Put me through
to Vice Admiral Stanforth.

36:28.754 --> 36:30.822
[comms signal chirping]

36:35.494 --> 36:36.962
[Halsey, over comms]
What have you found?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.665
Where the hell have you been?

36:39.765 --> 36:40.866
I'm in the CIC.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.734
Were you arrested?

36:42.834 --> 36:44.403
I'm not exactly sure.

36:44.503 --> 36:47.606
Okay, uh, we--
We may have a major problem.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.908
I-I think that the artifact
we brought back from

36:50.008 --> 36:52.611
the archeological site, I think
it was a sample container.

36:52.711 --> 36:54.913
It looked like inert spores
at first,

36:55.013 --> 36:58.317
but I think
it's some kind of parasite.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.321
Stay where you are.
I'm on my way to you.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.690
Aah!

37:04.790 --> 37:06.024
[gurgling and cracking]

37:06.124 --> 37:07.092
[gurgling and stretching]

37:07.192 --> 37:09.895
[screaming]

37:12.698 --> 37:14.199
Aah!

37:15.401 --> 37:17.035
[panicked screaming]

37:18.169 --> 37:19.538
Get off me!

37:23.709 --> 37:25.010
[Halsey gasps]

37:27.212 --> 37:29.180
[gunshots]

37:34.152 --> 37:35.487
[gurgling and cracking]

37:35.587 --> 37:38.724
[menacing music playing]

37:41.593 --> 37:43.529
Let me out! Please--

37:50.502 --> 37:53.071
[ominous music playing]

38:01.079 --> 38:02.581
This way.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.783
[Laera] Shh!

38:18.364 --> 38:19.465
[cracking sounds]

38:21.700 --> 38:23.435
[stretching and cracking]

38:23.535 --> 38:25.136
[Soren] Nope.

38:25.236 --> 38:27.305
[cracking and squishing
increase]

38:28.740 --> 38:29.841
[Laera screams]

38:29.941 --> 38:31.877
[Soren]
Move, get them out of here!

38:37.749 --> 38:39.451
Kwan!

38:41.953 --> 38:44.255
[yells]

38:46.725 --> 38:48.226
Soren!

38:50.429 --> 38:51.963
-Go!
-[Laera screams]

38:52.063 --> 38:53.965
Come on, let's go!

39:04.242 --> 39:05.577
Kwan!

39:07.646 --> 39:11.617
[gun clicks empty]

39:12.951 --> 39:15.020
[breathing heavily]

39:19.491 --> 39:21.359
[The Mother]
I knew you'd find me.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.798
We knew you would deliver us.

39:29.968 --> 39:31.537
[shaky breaths]

39:32.471 --> 39:33.939
Who are you?

39:34.540 --> 39:37.876
[The Mother]
I am you, Protector.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.377
Was you.

39:40.345 --> 39:43.449
So long ago, no one remembers.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.151
All your ancestors
are here with me.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.120
We are all within.

39:50.656 --> 39:51.823
Within?

39:54.359 --> 39:56.762
[The Mother]
It knows you, Kwan Ha.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.965
It wants more
than to subsume you.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.167
It desires your submission.

40:03.635 --> 40:04.603
Go.

40:04.703 --> 40:06.772
I can't hold them for long.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.540
[gasping softly]

40:11.042 --> 40:13.044
[dramatic music playing]

40:14.045 --> 40:15.280
What is it?

40:15.380 --> 40:17.348
[The Mother]
It is the cohesion.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.218
The meaning.

40:21.687 --> 40:23.421
The final equilibrium.

40:23.522 --> 40:24.656
[gasps]

40:24.756 --> 40:27.258
-This is the end.
-[cracking in unison]

40:27.358 --> 40:29.260
This is the Flood.

40:48.547 --> 40:49.815
[door chimes open]

40:49.915 --> 40:53.318
-What do we know?
-It starts off as inert spores.

40:53.418 --> 40:55.153
There were trace amounts
on the object

40:55.253 --> 40:56.955
we took from the site,
but it's spreading.

40:57.055 --> 40:58.657
It has the ability
to self-replicate.

40:58.757 --> 41:00.191
It appears to be stimulated

41:00.291 --> 41:01.493
by proximity to living tissue.

41:01.593 --> 41:02.661
This is remarkable.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.429
It's beautiful.

41:04.530 --> 41:06.865
No, no.
Not when it infects humans.

41:06.965 --> 41:09.434
-It seems to be--
-Neuro-reactive. Yes.

41:09.535 --> 41:11.002
Can we get out of here?

41:11.102 --> 41:13.204
[Halsey] If only you could see
as far as I can see,

41:13.304 --> 41:16.107
you'd understand
just how irrelevant we are.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.343
Do you realize
what we have here?

41:18.443 --> 41:20.011
A biological catastrophe.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.379
We'll have a connection.

41:21.479 --> 41:24.282
This organism was a contemporary
of a species

41:24.382 --> 41:26.451
who inhabited our galaxy
eons ago.

41:26.552 --> 41:28.687
A civilization
so advanced, they--

41:28.787 --> 41:31.523
they built bridges with light.

41:31.623 --> 41:32.991
And you want to go?

41:33.091 --> 41:35.326
Sometimes I don't understand
how you...

41:37.095 --> 41:40.465
You don't know how I what?
Go on, Halsey. Say it.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.137
Halsey?

41:52.243 --> 41:56.615
[tense music rises]

42:01.152 --> 42:02.854
[gasps]

42:10.528 --> 42:12.497
Let's move!

42:12.598 --> 42:14.065
Go.

42:14.165 --> 42:15.601
What about you?

42:15.701 --> 42:16.935
I'm going back for Kwan.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.837
-Soren--
-[Kwan] Go!

42:20.171 --> 42:21.773
Go, go, go!

42:23.541 --> 42:25.677
Go with your father.
I'm right behind you.

42:25.777 --> 42:29.347
[suspenseful music plays]

42:31.617 --> 42:33.284
[door shuts loudly]

42:38.023 --> 42:39.190
Hey!

42:40.058 --> 42:41.860
-[door thuds]
-Laera?

42:41.960 --> 42:43.261
I didn't mean it.

42:43.361 --> 42:44.596
I didn't mean it when I said

42:44.696 --> 42:46.097
I didn't want Kessler
to be like you.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.299
-I didn't mean it.
-[Soren] What are you doing?

42:48.399 --> 42:49.801
You're a good father.

42:49.901 --> 42:52.070
Don't run from it.
He needs you.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.247
You're gonna be okay.

43:05.316 --> 43:06.618
We can fix this.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.787
I love you both.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.657
No! Laera!

43:11.757 --> 43:13.625
-[pounds on door]
-Laera!

43:13.725 --> 43:15.861
-Laera!
-[pounding on door]

43:19.330 --> 43:20.866
Laera!

43:23.735 --> 43:25.170
[Laera] I love you.

43:28.707 --> 43:31.209
[somber music playing]

43:51.362 --> 43:52.597
[powering up]

43:52.698 --> 43:54.532
-[John] Makee.
-[Arbiter growls]

43:57.468 --> 44:00.071
You will not be spared
this time.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.609
I'm right here.

44:04.976 --> 44:07.512
Come meet your destiny, Demon.

44:07.612 --> 44:09.314
[snarls]

44:18.957 --> 44:20.625
[grunts]

44:31.669 --> 44:33.671
[Arbiter snarls]

44:35.140 --> 44:36.875
[sizzling]

44:36.975 --> 44:38.910
[panting]

44:44.983 --> 44:46.484
[grunting]

44:46.584 --> 44:48.086
[swords crackle]

44:48.186 --> 44:50.088
-[John grunts]
-[Arbiter roars]

44:51.522 --> 44:52.991
[grunts]

45:25.190 --> 45:29.795
[heroic music playing]

45:33.965 --> 45:37.668
Why do you not accept
your death?

45:38.703 --> 45:40.839
[John] We're not done.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.542
[both grunt]

46:16.241 --> 46:18.509
[panting]

46:24.415 --> 46:26.184
[gasps]

46:30.421 --> 46:33.724
[Arbiter] Kill me, Demon.

46:34.359 --> 46:37.028
End my shame.

46:38.396 --> 46:41.699
This is not the death
you deserve.

46:42.067 --> 46:47.973
Take my life.
Restore my honor.

46:48.773 --> 46:50.175
Tell him.

46:50.275 --> 46:53.611
No, I won't.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.446
You must.

46:59.817 --> 47:06.091
What is a soldier when he
can no longer fight?

47:14.465 --> 47:16.734
The Arbiter says--

47:16.834 --> 47:18.536
I know what he said.

47:18.636 --> 47:20.171
[sighs]

47:21.839 --> 47:23.875
-[blade pierces]
-[Arbiter groans]

47:23.975 --> 47:25.443
[sizzling]

47:33.584 --> 47:37.555
[powering up]

47:37.655 --> 47:42.060
[dramatic music rises]

47:42.160 --> 47:44.329
[engine powering up]

47:54.172 --> 47:56.807
He keeps asking
where his mom is.

47:58.009 --> 48:02.513
[somber music playing]

48:13.124 --> 48:15.493
-[crying softly]
-[Soren] Hey.

48:20.531 --> 48:22.300
[Kessler sniffling]

48:25.836 --> 48:27.205
Kessler.

48:29.407 --> 48:31.409
The monster's real.

48:34.845 --> 48:36.314
I know.

48:41.252 --> 48:42.820
[door sealing]

48:45.690 --> 48:47.325
[coolant hissing]

48:48.026 --> 48:50.061
This'll stop the progression.

48:51.262 --> 48:52.730
I'll bring you back.

48:53.764 --> 48:55.233
I promise.

48:56.501 --> 48:59.404
[faint screaming]

49:12.617 --> 49:15.020
[Makee] Wherever you go,
war will follow.

49:19.090 --> 49:20.725
You brought it here.

49:21.592 --> 49:24.329
Now there's nothing to be done
but start anew.

49:24.429 --> 49:26.264
Everything will be clean.

49:27.098 --> 49:28.466
[John] Everything?

49:29.434 --> 49:31.869
That's the Ring's purpose.

49:31.969 --> 49:33.304
And its power.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.973
[John]
You said you wanted peace.

49:36.074 --> 49:39.977
When they're gone,
peace is all that will remain.

49:41.146 --> 49:42.347
And silence.

49:42.447 --> 49:44.449
[John]
I can't let that happen.

49:44.549 --> 49:46.151
[Cortana] Chief?

49:49.454 --> 49:51.389
That can't be good.

49:52.423 --> 49:54.425
[distant rumbling]

50:01.966 --> 50:03.334
[John] Neither can that.

50:03.434 --> 50:05.336
[indistinct comms crosstalk]

50:06.304 --> 50:09.140
[Makee] There's so much
that you have yet to understand.

50:09.640 --> 50:12.043
About what we are, you and I.

50:12.143 --> 50:13.878
So much
you have yet to know.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.446
[John]
What don't I know?

50:16.847 --> 50:18.849
That I'm a Demon too.

50:22.420 --> 50:24.422
[doors slide closed]

50:25.490 --> 50:27.992
-[John] Cortana?
-[Cortana] I'm with you, Chief.

50:30.195 --> 50:33.431
[dramatic music playing]

50:33.531 --> 50:35.466
[powering up]

50:44.675 --> 50:46.744
[voice]
The fight doesn't end.

50:46.844 --> 50:48.179
Not for you.

50:48.279 --> 50:51.116
Even when you win.

50:51.216 --> 50:53.718
So tell me, why do you fight?

50:54.852 --> 50:58.423
They took my image
and bent it to their purpose,

50:58.523 --> 51:00.158
so I took it back.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.860
This armor
doesn't belong to them.

51:02.960 --> 51:04.629
It belongs to me.

51:05.029 --> 51:06.764
To the ones who are gone.

51:06.864 --> 51:09.200
And the ones
who are still in the fight.

51:09.967 --> 51:11.736
[voice] Perhaps
the other one was right.

51:11.836 --> 51:15.072
Perhaps you're not
who I require you to be.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.774
You can't trust her.

51:16.874 --> 51:19.043
She's dangerous.

51:19.144 --> 51:21.045
She said the same about you.

51:23.047 --> 51:24.315
I'm glad you're here.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.717
Although I knew you would be.

51:27.652 --> 51:30.087
It is awake
because you are here.

51:30.188 --> 51:32.957
You are here
because it is awake.

51:33.057 --> 51:34.659
What is it?

51:34.759 --> 51:36.994
It's been down there
all this time,

51:37.094 --> 51:40.030
waiting to meet you.

51:40.831 --> 51:42.600
In the dark.

51:45.236 --> 51:47.004
I'll be watching.

51:47.104 --> 51:48.639
[whirring sound]
