00:07.041 --> 00:08.976
<i>Promise me
you'll get him on that ship.</i>

00:08.976 --> 00:10.711
<i>Where's my mom?</i>
- Soren on Reach?

00:10.711 --> 00:12.746
Who's gonna look after him?

00:19.920 --> 00:21.389
Get up.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.492
<i>You said there were
other ways to live.</i>

00:24.492 --> 00:25.726
- That's right.
- Like what?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.228
<i>You know what I see?</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:29.363
<i>I see some hard-ass Marines.</i>

00:29.363 --> 00:32.100
I do not see defeat
in this room,

00:32.100 --> 00:34.502
and I do not see surrender.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.437
No, sir!

00:36.437 --> 00:38.606
<i>The enemy is at our gates.</i>

00:38.606 --> 00:40.408
<i>Their numbers are overwhelming.</i>

00:40.408 --> 00:42.910
<i>We will not be able
to hold them back forever.</i>

00:42.910 --> 00:43.944
Run.

00:48.149 --> 00:49.317
Just let Reach fall?

00:49.317 --> 00:51.051
They knew this was gonna happen.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.786
They saw it coming,
they did the math.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.889
When did you leave ONI, Admiral?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.325
<i>You never left.</i>

00:57.325 --> 01:00.161
Command bugged out.
Took high-ranking personnel.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.295
<i>Valuable assets.</i>

01:01.295 --> 01:02.396
They took our suits.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.964
Where's Danilo?

01:04.898 --> 01:05.733
<i>Riz!</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:07.535
He's not coming.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.939
<i>Any Marine who makes
this stand with us...</i>

01:15.309 --> 01:16.744
<i>...will not survive the day.</i>

01:17.845 --> 01:19.413
- Got a light?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.215
Jacob!
<i>For every moment</i>

01:21.215 --> 01:23.317
<i>that we hold the enemy at bay,</i>

01:23.317 --> 01:27.288
<i>more innocent people
can escape on the transports.</i>

01:27.288 --> 01:29.357
<i>And when they do,</i>

01:29.357 --> 01:30.891
<i>they will go forth</i>

01:30.891 --> 01:34.061
<i>and tell the story
that you write today.</i>

01:36.164 --> 01:39.133
<i>You will be remembered...</i>

01:40.033 --> 01:41.602
No!

01:41.602 --> 01:43.204
<i>...as the brave women and men</i>

01:43.204 --> 01:44.605
<i>who laid down their lives</i>

01:44.605 --> 01:46.274
<i>so that our children</i>

01:46.274 --> 01:48.242
<i>may live without fear</i>

01:48.242 --> 01:49.777
of this monster we call war.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.125
John!

02:06.594 --> 02:08.262
- John!

02:12.633 --> 02:13.701
Chief!

02:21.409 --> 02:23.277
Vannak!

02:24.478 --> 02:25.879
Where's Vannak?

02:32.119 --> 02:34.555
Reloading, right side!
I see 'em!

02:34.555 --> 02:36.524
We can't stay here!

02:36.524 --> 02:38.359
We get pinned down, we're done!

02:38.359 --> 02:39.560
I know!

02:39.560 --> 02:40.828
We gotta fall back!

02:44.232 --> 02:46.234
To where?

02:51.339 --> 02:53.006
- Go! Go!
- Moving!

02:55.809 --> 02:57.711
- Come on!
- Get off me!

02:57.711 --> 03:00.013
- I can fight!
- Moving!

03:12.693 --> 03:14.228
It's not over.

03:21.269 --> 03:22.903
Look at them all.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.975
They're coming back.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.181
Target in the open!

03:51.432 --> 03:53.334
Is that all you got?

04:05.279 --> 04:07.981
I thought I shouldn't have
said anything, but I said it.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.251
- Now I regret saying it.
- Please stop talking.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
Just like old times.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.688
Shut up!

04:19.893 --> 04:21.228
Oh, shit! Ah!

04:47.888 --> 04:50.257
I did that. That was me.

04:59.867 --> 05:02.803
I'm never gonna
hear the end of this.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.108
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.046
Halsey, get up!

05:15.583 --> 05:17.017
John.

05:17.017 --> 05:19.453
Can I get a little help
over here?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.526
Get in! Let's go!

05:25.526 --> 05:26.994
We got him!

05:27.561 --> 05:29.697
They're coming! Hurry up!

05:35.168 --> 05:37.204
Get in. Get us out of here.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.173
Vannak.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.208
No.

05:42.142 --> 05:43.844
Riz!

06:04.231 --> 06:05.198
Riz...

06:05.799 --> 06:07.300
No!

06:44.705 --> 06:45.906
Come on!

06:58.619 --> 06:59.820
Riz!

07:04.925 --> 07:07.160
Get us out of here!
Hang on!

07:07.160 --> 07:09.963
Riz.
Check her airway.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.231
It's me.

07:25.378 --> 07:27.214
John! John!

07:27.214 --> 07:30.050
- Riz...
- Look at me. Stay with me.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.952
No, Riz...
Stay with me, John.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.123
Chief.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.858
Wake up.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.094
I've got him. John. John?

07:41.094 --> 07:43.130
- John, wake up.
Riz...

07:43.964 --> 07:44.898
Save her.

07:45.633 --> 07:47.067
You should have stayed with me.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.636
Sever the connection.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.039
We're losing him.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.543
Please.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.212
Please, will you help him?

08:00.013 --> 08:01.515
That depends.

08:02.182 --> 08:05.152
What are you prepared
to do for me?

09:44.685 --> 09:47.154
You honor our people

09:47.955 --> 09:49.356
with this great victory.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.491
This was no victory.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.494
We have only secured
one of the stolen Keystones.

09:54.494 --> 09:58.031
And, once again,
the Blessed One has denied me.

09:58.632 --> 10:03.570
There is a time and place for
every step in the Great Journey.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.706
I grow weary of your gift.
This prophecy.

10:05.706 --> 10:09.910
The Demon's death
is to be my redemption.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.445
And you protect him--

10:12.445 --> 10:19.019
I have no concern for the Demon.
I serve a higher purpose.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.087
As do you.

10:20.087 --> 10:22.389
Do not preach at me, human.

10:22.389 --> 10:28.161
I remind you that
you live only by my grace.

10:28.161 --> 10:34.234
If my life offends you,
I beg you to take it.

10:53.220 --> 10:56.824
What is the value
of this human thing?

10:56.824 --> 10:59.092
It is a vessel.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.929
What does it contain?

11:01.929 --> 11:05.098
Knowledge. Human knowledge.

11:09.870 --> 11:14.574
Can it say where
they have taken the Keystone?

11:15.308 --> 11:19.579
Perhaps. I will not know
until I look inside.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.115
So look.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.385
She shouldn't
have gone back for him.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.354
- She knows better than that.
- You need to rest.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.824
- Your wound is still healing.
- Is she gonna live?

12:40.861 --> 12:43.230
She needs surgery.
I don't have the tools here.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.869
She thought she had
something to prove.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.440
And I used that to push her.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.377
She went back because of me.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.246
She went back because Spartans

12:59.246 --> 13:00.747
don't leave Spartans behind.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.249
There was no Spartan.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.017
He was already gone.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.954
She evaluated the conditions
and made a decision.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.957
What decision is that?

13:09.957 --> 13:12.325
Since when do we decide
anything? We don't choose.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.964
You told us where to go
and what to think, who to kill,

13:16.964 --> 13:20.767
and we did that every time,
without question.

13:20.767 --> 13:23.236
You followed orders
like soldiers.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.039
- Like machines.
- You're not a machine.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.875
Oh?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.409
What am I, then?

13:30.844 --> 13:34.047
Don't say human,
because real people have lives.

13:34.047 --> 13:36.149
They have families.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.986
- Possibilities.
- You're upset.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.055
- We all are.
Look at her.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.258
Look at her.

13:45.258 --> 13:46.960
- Tell me what you see.
- Let go.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.529
Tell me what you see!

13:49.529 --> 13:52.299
Is that a woman or a weapon?

13:52.299 --> 13:53.733
Is there a person in there,

13:53.733 --> 13:55.402
or is that just a piece
of equipment

13:55.402 --> 13:57.604
you leave on the battlefield,
dump and forget?

14:19.159 --> 14:21.428
They left us down there...

14:22.896 --> 14:24.031
to die.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.498
I know.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.639
No evac, no armor.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.308
- ONI knew we wouldn't make it.
- I know.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.377
What about the other teams
on Reach?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.979
Any contact?

14:41.814 --> 14:42.815
Kai?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.322
It was chaos.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.991
The city fell.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.794
Ships scattered.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.598
There's no way of telling how
many escaped, let alone who--

14:58.598 --> 15:01.234
- How long have I--?
- I had to induce a coma.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.303
- How long?
- Two days.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.339
- Two days.
- Two days?

15:07.207 --> 15:08.841
We gotta get back.

15:09.376 --> 15:10.677
- We gotta go--
- John, stop.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.545
- The survivors--
- John, John...

15:12.545 --> 15:14.647
People on Reach,
they need me.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.848
No.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.317
No, they don't.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.368
You have a fever.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.836
You're not yourself.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.042
I told them what would happen.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.643
- Come on.
- I told them.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.479
I told Ackerson.

15:53.886 --> 15:55.488
They already knew.

15:56.389 --> 15:57.624
They knew.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.659
And they did nothing.

16:00.527 --> 16:02.029
I could have stopped it.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.501
If I just... had my armor.

16:09.436 --> 16:12.005
If she was with me.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.407
Reach wasn't an accident.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.544
It was a plan.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.547
We need to be careful.

16:21.881 --> 16:23.050
Invisible.

16:23.050 --> 16:24.717
Do you understand?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.824
So...

16:34.427 --> 16:36.429
it's "we" now?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.468
It always has been.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.974
<i>I know you hear.</i>

16:47.974 --> 16:49.342
I know you see.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.843
Are you afraid?

16:53.080 --> 16:54.647
I summon you.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.151
I summon you in the name
of the Hierarchs,

16:58.151 --> 16:59.686
voices of the gods.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.022
Next time, you can just push
the little button there.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.160
Fascinating.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.898
This is a Covenant ship.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.600
This is the command vessel

17:13.600 --> 17:15.502
of the esteemed Zealot,
Var'Gatanai,

17:15.502 --> 17:17.604
former Supreme Commander
of the First Fleet

17:17.604 --> 17:19.139
of Solemn Accord.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.509
The Arbiter.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.712
What are you?

17:26.579 --> 17:28.115
I am Cortana,

17:28.115 --> 17:31.518
- the most advanced artificial--
- No.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.852
What are you...

17:34.821 --> 17:36.156
to him?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.425
Master Chief?

17:39.092 --> 17:40.093
I...

17:42.162 --> 17:43.763
We work together.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.034
What do you know of the demon?

17:49.369 --> 17:50.737
He remembers you.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.639
You keep his memories.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.843
Show me.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.114
Show me what he remembers

18:01.114 --> 18:02.382
of the Ring.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.151
It doesn't belong to you.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.554
I don't belong to you.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.826
If you cease to be useful
to me,

18:13.826 --> 18:16.929
I will cease to be useful
to the Hierarchs.

18:18.765 --> 18:24.237
You and I both know what happens
to an un-useful thing.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.081
There are all kinds of prisons.

18:38.151 --> 18:40.153
There you are.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.054
You talk in your sleep.

18:44.257 --> 18:45.592
He's back.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.595
Hey, buddy.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.097
You look like shit.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.067
Where's Halsey?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.270
Take it easy.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.838
You've been out for three days.

18:58.838 --> 19:02.141
I tried contacting the station.
Still nothing.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.747
She's a fighter.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.717
We're gonna get her help
when we get on the ground.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.919
- Where?
- Aleria.

19:12.919 --> 19:14.287
You heard of it?

19:15.322 --> 19:18.891
Busted mining outpost.
We'll be orbital in a few hours.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.263
Kessler's there.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.868
Come on.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.136
This way.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.784
I stay with him at night.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.188
Every night.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.611
Where are you going?

20:11.611 --> 20:14.213
I need to talk to Halsey.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.215
You're not even
gonna look at him?

20:17.517 --> 20:18.918
For what?

20:19.752 --> 20:21.020
I've seen it before.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.890
- He's your friend.
- This is a body.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.626
My friend isn't here.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.714
Set her on the gurney.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.382
What's happened?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.384
Have you got a sterile
field generator?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.853
- We have an operating room.
- Have you got biofoam?

20:53.853 --> 20:56.289
- Of course.
- Okay, set up a trauma station.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.057
Prep 100 cc's of poly.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.426
And if you're going to be
handling instruments,

20:59.426 --> 21:00.727
then disinfect your hands.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.729
- I'm the surgeon.
- Not today.

21:02.729 --> 21:05.332
Nurse, 100 cc's of poly...

21:16.609 --> 21:18.077
Nothing yet.

21:18.077 --> 21:20.146
They're still working on her.

21:21.814 --> 21:23.883
Riz is gonna be all right.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.986
Kessler?

21:28.555 --> 21:30.457
We're gonna ask around.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.858
Soren?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.128
There.

21:38.898 --> 21:41.100
Laera, hold up.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.202
Are you coming?

21:44.337 --> 21:46.072
He's not gonna leave her.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.940
Come on.

21:47.940 --> 21:50.109
You're gonna freeze out here.

22:10.262 --> 22:13.032
You the ones who landed
that piece of shit out there?

22:13.032 --> 22:15.802
- Howdy, friend.
Yeah, howdy yourself.

22:15.802 --> 22:19.005
I don't wanna even hear
about the northern range.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.040
All them parcels is gone.

22:21.508 --> 22:25.878
I still got some smaller pieces
near the old Volper foundry.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.214
You might have heard
the ground's poisoned.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.483
Well, it ain't.
It's supposed to be that color.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.318
That's the original.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.588
Hey.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.256
You stretch it, you buy it.

22:39.225 --> 22:40.727
It's on me.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.364
Ooh!

22:46.666 --> 22:48.501
I'll tell you what we can do.

22:49.201 --> 22:51.303
Why don't you tell me
what you're looking for.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.406
And I'll tell you
where you can find it.

22:53.406 --> 22:54.774
Our son.

22:56.108 --> 22:57.777
- What now?
Kessler.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.846
He's ten years old.
Wears a helmet.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.648
He was on a transport ship.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.617
Would have landed here
a couple of days ago.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.685
The, uh...

23:05.685 --> 23:07.420
The Bodegraven.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.823
Right. Right. Bodegraven.

23:10.823 --> 23:12.425
And this kid...

23:13.693 --> 23:15.161
you say it's yours?

23:16.228 --> 23:20.399
I'm only asking, as most folks
come through are spoken for.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.368
Especially little ones.

23:22.368 --> 23:23.803
People pay good money.

23:30.543 --> 23:31.944
Let's take a look.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.080
Let's.

23:39.619 --> 23:42.388
These last few days
been a goddamn circus.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.991
You heard about Reach?

23:44.991 --> 23:48.127
- Yes.
- I saw it coming a mile away.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.563
That so?
UNSC never gave a shit

23:50.563 --> 23:52.799
about the Covenant
coming for the Outer Colonies.

23:52.799 --> 23:55.702
I shouldn't be surprised their
chickens came home to roost.

23:55.702 --> 23:58.370
Bodegraven, right here.

24:06.345 --> 24:09.549
This is him. Bodegraven.
Boy, ten years old.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.220
- This is Kessler.
All right.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.556
I'm gonna need everything
you got on this kid.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.100
Here.

24:30.369 --> 24:31.571
Thanks.

24:34.273 --> 24:35.307
It's time.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.611
For what?

24:43.449 --> 24:44.584
No.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.252
What do you mean, no?

24:46.252 --> 24:48.821
We left him lying under a sheet.
We have to bury him.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.559
- You don't bury a Spartan.
- Uh, okay.

24:52.559 --> 24:55.027
So, what do you do?

24:55.027 --> 24:58.397
- Sorry, I can't help you.
- Why not?

24:58.397 --> 24:59.966
Are you scared?

25:04.604 --> 25:06.939
The moment a person
becomes a Spartan,

25:06.939 --> 25:08.941
their life in your world ends.

25:08.941 --> 25:10.877
They live in mine.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.580
There are no burials.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.648
There's no funerals.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.449
They've already said goodbye.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.023
Well, that's stupid.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.060
You're gonna wish
you had taken this chance.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.263
You have no idea
what I'd give to...

25:37.837 --> 25:40.106
Know what? Screw you.

25:40.106 --> 25:41.540
I'll bury him myself.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.911
- It makes no difference.
- It does to me.

25:46.646 --> 25:50.116
You put them in the ground
and you leave them there.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.520
Or they will follow you.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.614
So let me get this straight.

26:21.614 --> 26:24.016
You gotta clean it up,
but then the land is yours?

26:24.016 --> 26:26.252
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Nice. What's the catch?

26:26.252 --> 26:29.121
- No catch.
- No catch? Tell him.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.490
Well, we can't leave.
Not ever?

26:31.490 --> 26:34.060
Yeah, but who'd want to, right?

26:34.060 --> 26:36.195
I mean, look at this place.

26:36.195 --> 26:39.231
I'm happy for you.
It's beautiful, right?

26:39.231 --> 26:41.200
Stop.
- What?

26:41.200 --> 26:43.269
You're making friends
and enjoying the scenery.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.371
We're looking for our son,
Soren.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.975
I know.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.714
We were on Reach.
All those people. They're gone.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.316
A whole city.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.853
A whole planet.

27:00.853 --> 27:02.689
Does none of that touch you?

27:03.222 --> 27:05.725
- Of course, it does.
- Then act like it.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.328
You want me to be sad?

27:09.328 --> 27:11.530
Scared?

27:11.530 --> 27:13.632
Somebody's gotta
keep looking forward.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.268
When things fall apart,
you're never there.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.671
You ran from the Spartan
program.

27:18.671 --> 27:20.439
You ran from the Rubble.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.009
When Ruby Ann came for us,
it was all on me.

27:23.009 --> 27:24.443
Whoa, whoa. Hold on.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.445
You can't blame me for that.

27:26.445 --> 27:29.048
Would they have come for us
if you'd been there?

27:30.883 --> 27:34.486
And I do want you to be sad
and I do want you to be scared,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.724
because that's where I am
and I want you with me.

27:46.999 --> 27:48.835
<i>♪ And your perfect lover ♪</i>

27:48.835 --> 27:54.140
<i>♪ Just looks like
A perfect fool ♪</i>

27:54.140 --> 27:56.508
<i>♪ So you go running off ♪</i>

27:56.508 --> 27:59.645
<i>♪ In search

28:02.214 --> 28:03.682

28:03.682 --> 28:06.285
<i>♪ Seems to spring

28:42.955 --> 28:45.391
This is exactly how you looked.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.628
I was 14.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.700
I woke up after
the augmentation and...

28:54.700 --> 28:57.103
you looked at me.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.005
Do you remember what you said?

28:59.005 --> 29:00.506
Eyes.

29:00.506 --> 29:01.573
Look up.

29:06.112 --> 29:08.080
"One out of three."

29:08.747 --> 29:12.284
Oh, so many that were better
than me didn't survive.

29:14.821 --> 29:16.388
We get shot.

29:17.790 --> 29:19.091
We get hurt.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.794
We get up.

29:21.794 --> 29:23.195
We do it all again.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.197
That's all I know how to do.

29:25.197 --> 29:28.034
I taught you everything.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.802
Except how to quit.

29:29.802 --> 29:31.570
I don't do it for you.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.309
Riz...

29:38.510 --> 29:40.880
I did everything I could.

29:41.513 --> 29:44.050
But the damage is significant.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.119
You won't be the soldier
you once were.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.556
You were already diminished.

29:52.224 --> 29:53.860
So...

29:56.495 --> 29:58.297
you'll have to work harder.

30:41.240 --> 30:43.242
Why'd you have to be so big?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.213
Come on.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.749
How's this?

30:58.224 --> 30:59.758
Yeah, me too.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.867
<i>Damage accumulates.</i>

31:09.868 --> 31:13.505
She won't be the same
as she was, but time will help.

31:14.273 --> 31:16.909
Riz will live
and she will fight again.

31:16.909 --> 31:20.446
Well, none of us
are what we were.

31:20.446 --> 31:22.748
And now we're expendable.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.685
What happened on Reach
wasn't personal.

31:26.685 --> 31:29.255
It wasn't even strategic.
It was political.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.789
It was Parangosky.

31:34.826 --> 31:35.894
This...

31:36.929 --> 31:38.530
This was about control.

31:38.530 --> 31:42.001
About who dictates
how this war is fought.

31:44.803 --> 31:46.305
She won.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.944
You can't grieve
an entire planet.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.346
It's too big.

31:54.346 --> 31:56.648
Our minds won't let it be real.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.453
All those lives.
All those names.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.656
It's too much.

32:05.824 --> 32:08.360
I need you
to do something for me.

32:10.196 --> 32:12.298
I never got to bury anyone.

32:13.532 --> 32:15.734
Not my people.

32:15.734 --> 32:17.269
Not my family.

32:18.937 --> 32:22.708
Somehow, I need you
to be everyone that's gone.

32:25.211 --> 32:26.745
Can you do that?

32:32.151 --> 32:34.686
Parangosky's the one
who took Cortana out.

32:34.686 --> 32:37.223
How could you possibly
have remembered that?

32:37.223 --> 32:38.624
I don't know.

32:41.260 --> 32:44.130
There's a space inside...

32:44.130 --> 32:46.298
where there used to be a voice.

32:47.433 --> 32:49.768
I'm feeling that somebody
knew me.

32:52.038 --> 32:53.605
There was something that...

32:54.540 --> 32:56.508
Cortana said...

32:57.376 --> 32:59.378
right before she...

33:00.779 --> 33:02.014
Go on.

33:02.014 --> 33:04.483
What? What-- What did she say?

33:07.186 --> 33:09.655
How did you choose...

33:09.655 --> 33:11.990
W-W-W-What do you mean?

33:11.990 --> 33:13.659
How did you choose me?

33:16.128 --> 33:18.797
We created the genetic profile.

33:18.797 --> 33:20.766
- We surveyed all the children--
- No.

33:24.136 --> 33:25.704
Why me?

33:29.775 --> 33:31.943
I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

33:35.114 --> 33:36.848
Tell the truth.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.485
Just once.

33:52.564 --> 33:54.500
We're not done here.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.740
Stay back!

34:03.709 --> 34:06.178
Come closer,
I will dig another hole!

34:06.178 --> 34:07.646
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

34:07.646 --> 34:09.615
This crazy's trying
to take him!

34:09.615 --> 34:11.783
You can't put him in the ground.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.852
I beg to differ!

34:13.852 --> 34:15.787
Burn this body.
Let him find his way.

34:15.787 --> 34:17.923
Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:17.923 --> 34:19.091
Hey!

34:19.091 --> 34:22.528
- Get your hands off him!
Stop!

34:32.404 --> 34:33.705
Chief?

34:37.143 --> 34:39.044
This isn't death.

34:39.044 --> 34:41.347
This is loss.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.048
There's a difference.

34:54.025 --> 34:55.527
Put him in the sky.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.110
All right.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.759
- Soren.
- Yeah.

36:06.798 --> 36:09.235
- What do you want?
Good evening.

36:09.235 --> 36:10.669
You're trespassing.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.871
- Allow me to explain.
- We're here for our son.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.241
Your what?
- Our son.

36:15.241 --> 36:16.475
Kessler.

36:16.475 --> 36:18.009
Nice boy.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.312
- Like, yay, high--
- The kid is ours.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.713
- The hell he is.

36:21.713 --> 36:23.649
Now... let's calm down.

36:23.649 --> 36:25.884
You can calm down
somewhere else.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.553
This is a good home
and he likes it here,

36:27.553 --> 36:30.589
and I'll be damned if I'm giving
him up to a couple of strangers.

36:30.589 --> 36:32.858
We're not strangers.
We're his parents.

36:32.858 --> 36:36.027
Even if that were true,
some parents you'd be.

36:36.595 --> 36:38.664
He was half starved
when he got here.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.767
Looked like he'd been slapped
around a little too.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.802
- What did you say?
Yeah.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.705
I guess we know
who's responsible for that now.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.740
Fuck you! Kessler!

36:48.740 --> 36:51.743
Kessler, come out here
right now!

36:52.378 --> 36:53.645
Kessler!

36:54.346 --> 36:56.582
They have him. They took him.

36:56.582 --> 36:58.984
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.254
- Calm down.
- What are we gonna do?

37:02.254 --> 37:04.423
I'm here. I can handle this.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.659
- It's a negotiation.
- It's our son.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.962
Trust me.

37:12.364 --> 37:13.599
I'll be right back.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.885
Well, you all seem...

37:35.020 --> 37:36.322
ready.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.291
You never know when the world's
gonna fall apart.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.192
Indeed.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.665
This is some really good tea.

37:46.665 --> 37:49.668
You said to give you
five minutes.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.603
We already gave you two.

37:53.972 --> 37:56.308
I grew up in a place
just like this.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.410
What's that supposed to mean?

37:59.144 --> 38:01.513
It means I know what it is
to scratch out a life.

38:02.314 --> 38:05.050
The ground never gives you
what it promised.

38:06.385 --> 38:08.654
There's never quite enough
to go around.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.088
We get by.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.627
I'm the kind of guy
that can get things.

38:15.627 --> 38:19.965
The kind of things
that can compensate.

38:22.167 --> 38:25.136
I know what an extra pair
of hands can mean.

38:41.953 --> 38:44.122
Our boy isn't for sale.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.306
I'm gonna be honest with you.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.077
This is nothing
like where I grew up.

39:08.614 --> 39:10.148
I was born in hell.

39:11.550 --> 39:14.319
Raised in violence.

39:14.319 --> 39:17.322
<i>Being without a family,
without a home...</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:21.693
<i>without food,
without protection.</i>

39:22.794 --> 39:24.696
Kessler!

39:28.299 --> 39:30.469
Baby?

39:30.469 --> 39:32.838
I realized I can survive
all that.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.208
But the loneliness...

39:40.746 --> 39:42.914
If anything was gonna kill me...

39:44.783 --> 39:46.284
it would be that.

39:47.018 --> 39:49.020
It's really me.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.057
<i>So now I'm a father.</i>

39:52.057 --> 39:53.792
<i>And I live in fear...</i>

39:55.060 --> 39:56.728
It's okay.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.967
...that my boy...

40:01.967 --> 40:03.969
will never know that feeling.

40:07.539 --> 40:09.475
<i>That absence of love.</i>

40:13.411 --> 40:17.816
I am grateful that you're
the ones that took him in,

40:18.484 --> 40:23.822
because I know in time,
he'd find love here.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.962
But he's my son.

40:46.512 --> 40:48.146
Where did you get this?

40:49.414 --> 40:51.116
A boy gave it to me.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.819
On the transport.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.154
For protection.

40:58.056 --> 41:00.258
He-- He saw that I was scared.

41:01.893 --> 41:03.361
Where is he?

41:08.133 --> 41:10.168
They took him away.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.378
They're gonna let us
see Kessler.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.415
Is that...?

41:24.415 --> 41:25.751
No.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.418
It's not Kessler.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.417
Reach was more than a place.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.486
It was a symbol.

42:02.053 --> 42:04.756
It was a monument
to the human spirit...

42:05.724 --> 42:10.095
and to those who sacrificed
everything to defend it.

42:11.296 --> 42:16.001
Those like Admiral Jacob Keyes.

42:18.003 --> 42:21.172
And this Spartan, Vannak Amadi.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.877
He was born on Tribute.

42:25.877 --> 42:28.714
I met him when he was six.

42:28.714 --> 42:30.481
I could see he had honor.

42:31.583 --> 42:34.052
He had a large family.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.421
They would be proud
of his service.

42:45.997 --> 42:48.533
His family buried him
when he was six.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.336
They never knew him.

42:56.507 --> 42:57.976
But I did.

43:07.619 --> 43:10.588
His name was Vannak-134.

43:12.157 --> 43:14.525
He was a Spartan.

43:14.525 --> 43:17.128
He was our brother.

43:17.128 --> 43:19.530
And the only family
that he ever knew.

43:23.334 --> 43:27.505
This... This was not
an ordinary man.

43:29.340 --> 43:33.511
Everything that he was,
everything that he gave...

43:38.149 --> 43:39.985
it never dies.

43:55.033 --> 43:56.968
Your fight is not done.

43:58.704 --> 44:00.571
I will be your weapon now.

44:02.540 --> 44:05.276
I will find the ones
who caused your death,

44:06.177 --> 44:07.879
and I will end them.

45:09.640 --> 45:12.143
You think
you can get to Parangosky?

45:12.143 --> 45:13.478
To Ackerson?

45:13.478 --> 45:15.013
You don't even know
where they are.

45:15.013 --> 45:16.347
I'll find them.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.049
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.120
I didn't choose you.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.229
I found you.

45:32.230 --> 45:33.698
Whatever built the Halo,

45:33.698 --> 45:36.634
whatever left
those artifacts behind,

45:36.634 --> 45:39.337
left something in you.

45:39.337 --> 45:40.972
You can't run from this.

45:41.773 --> 45:44.509
This has been calling to you
your whole life.

45:44.509 --> 45:46.544
This is what you're meant to do.

45:46.544 --> 45:50.448
The only thing I have to do
is find Parangosky, Ackerson.

45:50.448 --> 45:55.821
John, you can take us
to the Halo.

45:55.821 --> 46:00.458
The survival of our species
depends on what it can teach us.

46:01.159 --> 46:05.263
If you go after ONI yourself,
you put all of that at risk.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.166
They can't let you live.

46:14.239 --> 46:15.740
I'm already dead.

46:27.752 --> 46:29.420
<i>Join us.</i>

46:31.122 --> 46:32.457
What?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.395
Sorry, did...

46:39.330 --> 46:41.499
Did you say something to me?

46:43.134 --> 46:45.136
I speak for the planet.

46:46.337 --> 46:48.073
Oh, you do?

46:48.073 --> 46:50.475
I speak for all the planets.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.279
Okay.

46:59.750 --> 47:00.919
Where is...

47:00.919 --> 47:02.653
I speak for Madrigal.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.226
What did you say?

47:08.226 --> 47:10.761
I cry out in pain.

47:10.761 --> 47:12.630
My children are ash.

47:12.630 --> 47:14.599
My skin is broken. My heart--

47:14.599 --> 47:17.302
- Who the hell are you?
- Who are you?

47:23.875 --> 47:25.210
No one.

47:26.444 --> 47:27.913
You're Kwan Ha.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.481
Last of the Has.

47:32.283 --> 47:33.584
How...

47:36.187 --> 47:37.588
How do you...

47:38.623 --> 47:41.192
- Who are you?
- You turned your back on us.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.428
- You forgot your name.
- Get away from me.

47:43.428 --> 47:44.829
It's close now.

47:45.496 --> 47:47.498
- The monster.
- Stay where you are!

47:47.498 --> 47:49.800
Help me. Find me.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.437
Deliver me. Save me.

47:52.437 --> 47:53.939
Do not deny your purpose.

47:53.939 --> 47:56.942
- Do not forsake your name.
- Leave me alone!

47:56.942 --> 47:58.476
Protector.

48:04.082 --> 48:05.450
What did you...?

48:41.586 --> 48:43.254
What have you done?

48:43.254 --> 48:46.624
Why are we at High Charity?

48:46.924 --> 48:49.727
Our fleet has been recalled.

48:49.727 --> 48:52.263
No. We have a mission,
to retrieve the--

48:52.263 --> 48:54.932
We failed the mission.

48:54.932 --> 48:56.501
Accept that.

48:56.501 --> 48:59.104
Do you know

48:59.104 --> 49:01.239
what they will do to us?

49:01.239 --> 49:02.740
To me?

49:02.740 --> 49:04.976
I can only hope
that they will accept

49:04.976 --> 49:06.244
this token as an offering,

49:06.244 --> 49:09.514
to mitigate my failure.

49:12.217 --> 49:13.951
Do not do this.

49:13.951 --> 49:16.154
The Hierarchs command it.

49:16.154 --> 49:17.955
The Hierarchs are liars.

49:17.955 --> 49:23.528
Blaspheme again, and I will
rip the breath from your body.

49:23.528 --> 49:24.962
The Prophets are false.

49:25.230 --> 49:28.299
They have no intention
of beginning the Great Journey.

49:28.299 --> 49:29.834
It is not in their power
to do so.

49:29.834 --> 49:30.901
They are not Chosen.

49:31.536 --> 49:34.772
And they know it.
It is our destiny I have seen.

49:34.772 --> 49:37.708
You will be the one to lead us
to the Sacred Ring.

49:37.708 --> 49:42.247
Your flattery is as cruel
as it is empty.

49:42.247 --> 49:43.448
These Prophets
that would shame you

49:43.448 --> 49:45.083
do so because they fear you.

49:45.083 --> 49:48.686
They see your greatness
and the purity of your faith.

49:48.686 --> 49:53.391
And it makes them
choke on their hypocrisy.

50:31.696 --> 50:35.466
How are you doing this?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.471
This is not my doing.
This is yours.

50:40.471 --> 50:44.809
This is your destiny.
You need only take it.

50:46.311 --> 50:48.246
What must I do?

50:48.246 --> 50:53.618
Believe.
You must believe. In me.

50:53.618 --> 50:55.886
I am the Blessed One.

50:56.654 --> 51:01.959
They will send the entire fleet
to hunt us down.

51:01.959 --> 51:04.529
And they will fail.

51:06.131 --> 51:08.699
It is written.

52:39.290 --> 52:40.758
Can I help you?

52:42.560 --> 52:43.828
Gloves?

52:44.695 --> 52:46.264
Right over there.

52:53.571 --> 52:55.139
Oh, it's you.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.642
I didn't recognize you
with your...

52:59.810 --> 53:01.712
Do you have any barbed wire?

53:04.782 --> 53:07.151
Where's that, uh,
fella that was with you?

53:07.151 --> 53:08.553
He wanted to come.

53:09.854 --> 53:12.189
But I didn't think
that would be prudent.

53:13.558 --> 53:14.859
Prudent?

53:16.761 --> 53:20.130
He can be a bit emotional.

53:21.966 --> 53:25.770
Whereas I see this kind of
situation a bit more clearly.

53:26.871 --> 53:30.241
- I don't think I understand.
- Of course you do.

53:30.241 --> 53:32.943
You had a mother, didn't you?

53:32.943 --> 53:34.812
- Yeah.
No one should come

53:34.812 --> 53:36.814
between a mother and her child.

53:36.814 --> 53:38.983
It's a powerful bond.

53:40.084 --> 53:41.519
Instinctive.

53:41.519 --> 53:44.589
You know, we got a lot of kids
coming through here--

53:50.461 --> 53:52.430
The other day...

53:53.398 --> 53:55.800
I caught a scent in the air,
that took me back

53:55.800 --> 53:58.102
to the first time
I cut Kessler's hair.

53:59.604 --> 54:01.005
He was so little.

54:01.005 --> 54:04.241
Look, lady, I--
I'm just a businessman.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.843
He was squirming.

54:07.077 --> 54:09.614
I was nervous
that I would hurt him.

54:12.216 --> 54:14.819
And that's when I knew...

54:14.819 --> 54:17.422
that if anyone
ever caused him pain,

54:17.422 --> 54:19.590
there's no telling
what I would do.

54:20.858 --> 54:22.393
There would be no limit.

54:27.832 --> 54:29.800
You know what I mean?

54:42.246 --> 54:43.548
Did he talk?

54:43.548 --> 54:45.583
Yes.

54:45.583 --> 54:47.352
Did he say who took Kessler?

54:49.487 --> 54:50.855
The UNSC.

55:06.236 --> 55:08.205
We're wheels up in ten.

55:11.141 --> 55:12.443
Riz...

55:12.443 --> 55:15.245
- get your stuff--
I'm not gonna make it.

55:16.914 --> 55:18.449
What are you talking about?

55:19.083 --> 55:21.419
- You're gonna be fine.
- I'm gonna stay here.

55:24.021 --> 55:25.923
Get your head in the game.

55:26.791 --> 55:28.926
My fight's over, Chief.

55:35.132 --> 55:37.267
It's over when Vannak
says it's over.

55:37.267 --> 55:39.404
- When Kai says--
- Chief--

55:39.404 --> 55:40.938
It's over when we win!

55:43.441 --> 55:44.842
On your feet.

55:48.145 --> 55:50.448
I gave you an order, Spartan.

55:50.448 --> 55:53.150
Stand up.

56:11.436 --> 56:13.303
We lost Reach.

56:13.303 --> 56:15.372
We lost Vannak...

56:15.372 --> 56:16.741
- Kai...
- I know.

56:16.741 --> 56:19.610
Then what are you
gonna do about it?

56:19.610 --> 56:21.412
I'm going to live.

56:24.882 --> 56:27.251
You don't get to say no
to this.

56:27.251 --> 56:29.587
We owe them, Riz.

56:29.587 --> 56:30.955
We lost them.

56:32.256 --> 56:34.792
- I lost them.
- It's just pain.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.895
All you can do is carry it.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.431
But it's heavy.

56:41.165 --> 56:43.901
And the more you deny it,
the more you run from it,

56:43.901 --> 56:45.436
the heavier it gets.

56:47.104 --> 56:50.274
If you don't make peace with it,
it will crush you.

56:51.942 --> 56:53.878
I won't let it crush me.

56:58.616 --> 57:00.885
You're all I have left.

57:04.188 --> 57:05.422
I know.

57:25.843 --> 57:27.478
She's not coming.

57:37.421 --> 57:38.856
So...

57:40.090 --> 57:41.526
you're no one now.

59:17.287 --> 59:19.590
Attention on deck!
