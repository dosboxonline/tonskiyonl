WEBVTT

00:16.141 --> 00:17.392
Is she in a lot of pain?

00:19.853 --> 00:20.895
Yes.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.606
It didn't seem as bad before…

00:25.650 --> 00:27.652
but it was unbearable this time.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.488
She was screaming in pain.

00:30.572 --> 00:32.741
I'll prescribe some stronger painkillers.

00:33.992 --> 00:36.745
We've drained the fluid
three times in the last month.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.914
It may be difficult
to take care of her at home now.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.376
I can write you a referral
if you plan to put her in a nursing home.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.840
Right. I see.

00:49.758 --> 00:50.592
Thank you.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.096
- Your prescription is ready.
- Thanks.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.351
Eight. Here you go.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.269
Thank you.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.783
Weep for our sins!

01:14.866 --> 01:16.618
Confess!

01:16.701 --> 01:19.120
Confess your sins!

01:20.455 --> 01:21.664
Atone for your sins!

01:22.248 --> 01:25.043
We speak to all sinners hiding their sins!

01:25.543 --> 01:27.003
Repent your sins!

01:28.046 --> 01:30.673
God is giving you a chance!

01:30.757 --> 01:32.258
Atone for your sins!

01:39.390 --> 01:40.475
Hello, chief.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.230
Yeah, I don't think
I can come to work for a while.

01:46.064 --> 01:46.981
I'm sorry.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.610
Well, it's just some family matters.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.031
Okay. Sure.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.284
Yes, of course. Thank you, sir.

01:59.077 --> 01:59.911
Bye.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.407
Excuse me.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.325
I'm sorry.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.290
- I'll go this way.
- All right.

03:28.625 --> 03:29.876
I think he went this way.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.001
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

04:24.055 --> 04:24.889
Yes.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.641
We'll take his daughter first.

04:29.769 --> 04:31.354
He's here! You bastard!

04:31.437 --> 04:32.772
Hey! It's Jin Kyunghun!

04:32.855 --> 04:33.982
What are you doing?

04:34.065 --> 04:34.899
Heejung!

04:37.527 --> 04:39.070
- Get her in the car!
- Heejung!

04:39.153 --> 04:40.196
Let me go!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.365
Don't let him go! Stop him!

04:42.865 --> 04:44.075
Let go, you bastard!

04:44.158 --> 04:45.243
Stop him!

04:46.244 --> 04:47.370
- Heejung!
- Dad!

04:47.453 --> 04:48.454
Heejung!

04:48.538 --> 04:49.872
Stop fighting! Cut it out!

04:49.956 --> 04:51.249
- Dad!
- Let go of me!

04:51.332 --> 04:52.500
Mr. Jin Kyunghun.

04:53.251 --> 04:55.336
You did so well
hiding behind a new identity.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.838
You weren't easy to find.

04:57.672 --> 04:58.673
Let me go!

04:58.756 --> 05:01.759
The committee just wants to ask you
a few things, so calm down.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.012
- Why are you so worked up?
- Dad!

05:04.095 --> 05:06.264
- Hurry! Get her in the car!
- Yes, sir!

05:11.769 --> 05:12.937
Stop him, for God's sake!

05:13.604 --> 05:15.690
Get him! All of you!

05:17.734 --> 05:19.027
Dad!

05:19.110 --> 05:20.361
- Let me go!
- Hey, stop!

05:22.030 --> 05:23.156
Grab a hold of him!

05:26.492 --> 05:29.454
- Hey, get him in the car. Let's clear out.
- Stay still!

05:29.537 --> 05:30.913
- Let's clear out.
- Yes, sir.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.791
- Hold him tight, or he'll escape.
- Back up!

05:35.918 --> 05:37.337
You can't come through here!

05:40.506 --> 05:41.341
What the hell?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.603
- That's Min Hyejin!
- It's Min Hyejin!

05:54.979 --> 05:56.230
- Hey!
- Stop her!

06:09.827 --> 06:11.454
Go! Just go!

06:11.537 --> 06:13.122
- Let's go!
- Go!

06:13.206 --> 06:14.665
Hurry! Go!

06:16.459 --> 06:17.293
Hey!

06:18.336 --> 06:19.921
- Hey! Shut the door!
- Dad!

06:20.004 --> 06:21.255
- Shut the door!
- No!

06:23.633 --> 06:25.009
You're not going anywhere!

06:25.760 --> 06:26.803
No!

06:28.262 --> 06:29.597
Get in that car. Hurry!

06:30.431 --> 06:31.474
This way, sir.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.309
Get in the car! Come on!

06:34.727 --> 06:35.561
Hey!

06:38.481 --> 06:40.233
After them! Run!

07:25.611 --> 07:27.238
- Let go of me!
- Stay still!

08:26.005 --> 08:28.966
Heejung, are you all right?
Are you hurt?

08:29.467 --> 08:30.468
- Over here.
- Heejung!

08:33.638 --> 08:34.472
Come on.

08:57.995 --> 08:58.871
It's okay now.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.414
Don't worry. I got you.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.103
What?

09:22.770 --> 09:23.604
Are you sure?

09:24.188 --> 09:27.858
Yes, she even had a scar on her face.
It was definitely Min Hyejin.

09:30.319 --> 09:32.488
But how did they know about our plan?

09:33.447 --> 09:36.951
We've weeded out all the fucking moles
over the years, so how?

09:37.034 --> 09:40.705
We're working with the government on this.
Maybe there was a leak on their end.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.915
Fuck those goddamn vermin.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.919
Don't tell anyone about this for now.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.754
- Not even our own, okay?
- Yes, sir.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.757
And make a list of people
who know about this. Understood?

09:52.258 --> 09:53.259
Yes, sir.

09:54.051 --> 09:54.927
Get out now.

09:55.011 --> 09:55.886
Yes, sir.

09:56.512 --> 09:57.346
I'm sorry.

10:08.065 --> 10:14.363
You can consider it a preparatory phase
to boost our approval ratings.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.698
- Understood.
- All right.

10:19.910 --> 10:21.370
This is Lee Sugyeong.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.206
<i>Hello, Senior Secretary Lee.</i>
<i>This is Kim Jeongchil.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:26.542
<i>I have an urgent matter to discuss.</i>

10:29.420 --> 10:31.464
The detective got away.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.009
How did that happen?

10:35.092 --> 10:38.429
<i>We literally put everything together</i>
<i>and handed it to you.</i>

10:38.512 --> 10:43.851
It looks like that skank Min Hyejin
and the Sodo people got to him first.

10:43.934 --> 10:44.769
I'm sorry.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.772
Sodo? I see.

10:48.939 --> 10:51.901
I didn't expect
your security to be that lax.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.321
We can't be sure it was leaked from our--

10:55.404 --> 10:57.740
Still, I'm glad it was Sodo that took him.

10:57.823 --> 10:58.991
Sorry?

10:59.075 --> 11:01.202
It's better than if it were the Arrowhead.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.329
If it's Sodo, well…

11:04.288 --> 11:07.583
They haven't done anything
with the baby all these years.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.170
Even if they found Jung Jinsu,
they'd simply hide him.

11:11.754 --> 11:15.257
<i>If Jung Jinsu decides to show himself,</i>
<i>I'm sure he'll come to you.</i>

11:15.341 --> 11:16.467
You think so?

11:17.093 --> 11:18.469
<i>More importantly,</i>

11:18.552 --> 11:24.016
this means that they already know
about Park Jungja as well.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.896
We should speed things up.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.357
<i>"Speed things up"? What do you mean?</i>

11:32.233 --> 11:35.820
Let's announce
Park Jungja's resurrection tonight.

11:35.903 --> 11:36.862
<i>Can you do it?</i>

11:37.697 --> 11:40.324
But we don't even have
the first draft of the New Will yet.

11:40.825 --> 11:43.661
We can take our time
with things like that.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.831
What's important right now
is that we make the headlines first

11:47.415 --> 11:48.749
<i>before they spoil it.</i>

11:49.583 --> 11:51.419
<i>Make Park Jungja's resurrection public.</i>

11:51.502 --> 11:52.753
As for the New Will,

11:52.837 --> 11:55.715
let's announce it
in three months or so.

11:56.590 --> 11:57.508
<i>Good with that?</i>

11:58.008 --> 12:00.803
Yes, I'll make sure
everything goes smoothly.

12:01.762 --> 12:06.225
Oh, and we'll put together our own team
to handle the New Will.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.477
<i>Please hurry the announcement.</i>

12:09.353 --> 12:11.397
- Right, okay.
- <i>All right.</i>

12:26.746 --> 12:28.205
What's taking them so long?

12:33.335 --> 12:34.170
They're here.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.509
How long has she been sick?

13:25.429 --> 13:26.847
About five years.

13:28.307 --> 13:32.394
After surgery and chemotherapy,
she seemed to be getting better,

13:33.521 --> 13:34.980
but her cancer came back.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.776
They say they can't do
anything else for her.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.363
I've heard a lot of stories…

13:45.658 --> 13:47.827
about you.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.790
So why are both you and the New Truth

13:54.208 --> 13:56.252
chasing after us?

13:57.211 --> 14:00.464
According to our informant
planted inside the New Truth…

14:03.008 --> 14:05.344
Ms. Park Jungja has come back to life.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.349
Man, at this point,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.310
nothing surprises me anymore.

14:15.187 --> 14:18.482
Well, Eunyul and Hayul
would be happy to hear that.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.278
It looks like the government
and the New Truth

14:23.028 --> 14:25.698
are going to announce a new doctrine
using Ms. Park.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.409
But there's a risk to their plan.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.912
A risk…

14:33.747 --> 14:36.500
Is it the possibility
of Jung Jinsu coming back to life?

14:37.751 --> 14:38.586
Yes.

14:39.295 --> 14:44.508
They fear he may come back to life,
and things will get out of control.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.055
Then I guess you all want to know
where his demonstration took place.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.392
Yeah.

14:54.059 --> 14:54.894
Of course.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.771
You know, don't you?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.735
Could you please tell us?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.999
You must have resented me deeply.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.004
Why did you

15:23.380 --> 15:27.593
keep it a secret that Jung Jinsu
had received a decree 20 years ago?

15:28.677 --> 15:32.598
Well, if I didn't…
would things be different?

15:36.310 --> 15:38.687
Heejung has less than three months.

15:40.439 --> 15:41.815
I won't waste that time

15:42.691 --> 15:44.944
destroying everything she believes in.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.197
Please leave us now.

15:49.239 --> 15:51.617
Thank you for saving us though.

15:54.078 --> 15:55.996
You have a sick daughter.
What will you do?

15:59.124 --> 16:02.461
We've prepared a place for you.
Stay there with your daughter.

16:03.545 --> 16:06.256
I won't force you to answer us, so--

16:06.340 --> 16:07.591
You know, that baby

16:08.842 --> 16:10.427
who survived the demonstration…

16:11.553 --> 16:16.517
From time to time,
I wonder if that baby's… doing well.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.353
We have the child safe in our custody.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.565
Yes, I'm sure,
but I'm not talking about their safety.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.320
Is the child…

16:30.322 --> 16:31.907
getting the love they deserve?

16:35.828 --> 16:37.955
Have you told them about their parents?

16:39.623 --> 16:41.500
Have you ever told them

16:42.209 --> 16:47.047
that their mom and dad loved them…
more than anything in the world?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.347
It was the orphanage.

16:57.516 --> 17:01.437
In the room at the end of the second floor
of the orphanage where he grew up.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.274
Just promise me one thing.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.695
Please make sure Heejung never finds out

17:11.196 --> 17:12.948
about Jung Jinsu's demonstration.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.953
While your job is to tell the truth…

17:20.164 --> 17:22.249
mine is to hide it.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.218
All right, easy. There.

17:35.804 --> 17:37.222
Please get in.

17:41.101 --> 17:42.061
Shall we go now?

17:42.561 --> 17:43.395
Let's go.

17:43.479 --> 17:44.396
Please.

18:06.251 --> 18:08.378
Good work today. I'll be in touch.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.073
THE ARROWHEAD SHALL MAKE NEW HISTORY

18:36.156 --> 18:39.201
KARAOKE BAR
DO NOT SEEK PLEASURE

19:52.399 --> 19:53.775
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.033
Rough day, huh?
I heard you found the location.

20:01.116 --> 20:03.410
Yes, the northern branch will handle it.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.786
How's Jaehyeon today?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.039
Nothing special about her today.

20:07.122 --> 20:10.000
She walked to the edge
of the restricted area.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.127
Did she get all the way there?

20:13.128 --> 20:17.174
Ever since the Arrowhead wrecked the area
to dismantle the pleasure industry,

20:17.257 --> 20:18.800
no one really comes here anymore.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.803
<i>"Old man,</i>
<i>where does your singing voice come from?"</i>

20:21.887 --> 20:23.889
<i>"It comes from my mouth."</i>

20:23.972 --> 20:27.017
<i>"Liar. That kind of voice</i>
<i>never comes out of our mouths."</i>

20:27.726 --> 20:29.811
"Oh boy, what I mean is…"

20:30.687 --> 20:33.357
"Just then, one of the goblins yelled,

20:33.440 --> 20:34.524
'That's it, old man!'

20:34.608 --> 20:37.569
'We'll give you treasure,
so sell your singing sack to us.'"

20:38.528 --> 20:39.947
Aunt Hyejin…

20:40.822 --> 20:41.657
What?

20:42.157 --> 20:44.117
When will Aunt Hyejin be back?

20:45.494 --> 20:49.414
Ms. Min is going to be back late,
so let me read to you tonight.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.415
Are you sleepy?

20:50.499 --> 20:53.502
It's more fun when Aunt Hyejin reads it.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.962
Why?

20:55.045 --> 20:56.755
It's the same story, Jaehyeon.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.717
She does the voices when she reads.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.221
She does? How should I do it?

21:08.267 --> 21:09.643
"That's it, old man!"

21:11.144 --> 21:14.690
He'd be too scared to sell it
if the goblin sounded like that.

21:15.816 --> 21:16.650
<i>Sorry.</i>

21:17.526 --> 21:18.819
<i>Let me try again. Sorry.</i>

21:19.486 --> 21:21.071
She's making Sora sweat.

21:21.655 --> 21:22.990
She's just a normal child.

21:24.658 --> 21:25.492
What?

21:28.537 --> 21:32.958
There's nothing special about her
that explains how she survived.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.584
Don't jump to any conclusions.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.671
She is the sole survivor
of the demonstration.

21:37.754 --> 21:40.632
Assumptions like that
might make you overlook the truth.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.427
Come on, I'm just saying.

21:46.179 --> 21:48.765
Wait, I'll just quickly wash up
and take over for you.

21:48.849 --> 21:49.933
You don't have to.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.310
You must be tired.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.575
Only our people know about this place,
so you can stay without any worries.

22:13.915 --> 22:17.294
And here's some medicine
our doctors prepared.

22:17.377 --> 22:18.211
Thanks.

22:18.712 --> 22:22.257
We'll be in the basement.
Let us know if you need anything.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.967
Good night, then.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.094
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

22:43.653 --> 22:44.529
My…

22:45.781 --> 22:47.032
my phone.

22:48.950 --> 22:49.785
Well…

22:50.952 --> 22:55.791
I'll get you a new one tomorrow.
In the meantime, rest.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.250
No.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.711
I need it now!

23:01.380 --> 23:04.216
We don't know what kind of crap
the New Truth might be up to.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.134
I need to keep an eye on them.

23:07.594 --> 23:11.264
Do you have any idea how many people
are waiting for my commentary?

23:13.141 --> 23:14.267
I'm the only one

23:14.351 --> 23:18.563
who really understands
what's going on right now!

23:22.234 --> 23:26.321
So get me a phone, a laptop, or whatever.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.574
Bring it to me right now!

23:29.658 --> 23:31.159
There's something I don't understand.

23:32.369 --> 23:36.581
Why is the New Truth after us?

23:38.125 --> 23:39.876
Do you know what it might be?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.294
You're the expert.

23:43.213 --> 23:44.589
Well, isn't it obvious?

23:45.340 --> 23:47.843
Now that Kim Jeongchil is losing ground,

23:48.343 --> 23:51.096
they're trying to erase
everything about Chairman Jung Jinsu.

23:53.348 --> 23:56.143
They want to destroy
Chairman Jung's reputation

23:56.226 --> 23:59.396
by revealing what he and I said.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.859
So they probably needed our testimony.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.365
But I'd never have said a word anyway,
even if they had taken me.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.828
You can never say anything either.

24:15.620 --> 24:16.455
Okay?

24:17.247 --> 24:19.499
Of course. I won't say a word.

24:20.542 --> 24:23.628
You and Chairman Jung worked so hard
to create this world.

24:25.213 --> 24:27.591
We must protect it until he comes back.

24:28.091 --> 24:28.925
That's right.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.428
Tell me…

24:32.429 --> 24:35.474
tell me again
about the last time you met him.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.975
My goodness.

24:39.060 --> 24:40.645
Aren't you tired of hearing it?

24:41.813 --> 24:42.731
Come on.

24:43.815 --> 24:44.900
Tell me.

24:47.152 --> 24:47.986
Let's see.

24:49.821 --> 24:54.493
Back then, I almost… got beaten to death,

24:55.827 --> 25:00.957
but Chairman Jung made a video call
and saved my life.

25:02.167 --> 25:06.004
But at the time,
I thought he had kidnapped you.

25:06.880 --> 25:09.799
I cursed him out and went after him.

25:13.845 --> 25:14.763
And…

25:16.765 --> 25:18.141
<i>there he was.</i>

25:20.519 --> 25:21.770
He said, "Detective Jin,

25:23.230 --> 25:27.025
Heejung is the only person I've met

25:28.109 --> 25:31.112
who truly understands God's will
as well as I do."

25:32.531 --> 25:34.324
<i>"That's why I chose her."</i>

25:37.452 --> 25:42.749
"Heejung and I have gifted
a new world to humanity."

25:43.542 --> 25:45.001
<i>"But I am leaving now."</i>

25:47.671 --> 25:49.422
"But when the new world

25:51.132 --> 25:54.261
is in need of new enlightenment,

25:54.761 --> 25:56.179
<i>I will come back."</i>

25:58.557 --> 25:59.391
"By that time…

26:03.019 --> 26:04.229
I'm sure…

26:06.273 --> 26:08.984
Heejung will have grown
even more faithful."

26:12.028 --> 26:14.197
"Please freely enjoy the world…

26:18.118 --> 26:19.786
that Heejung and I have created."

26:40.557 --> 26:42.559
We go live in one minute. Please stand by.

26:42.642 --> 26:44.978
I think he needs a bit more here and here.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.698
You just need to look at the camera
and read the script.

26:56.781 --> 26:58.617
Don't do anything we didn't discuss.

26:59.326 --> 27:00.619
Let's stand up straight.

27:01.119 --> 27:02.245
All right, good.

27:03.413 --> 27:04.914
The chairman is ready.

27:04.998 --> 27:06.249
We're going live

27:06.833 --> 27:09.127
in five, four, three,

27:09.628 --> 27:10.879
two, one.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.466
Hello, everyone.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.011
I'm Chairman Kim Jeongchil
of the New Truth.

27:19.387 --> 27:23.391
I stand before you today
with a special announcement.

27:23.933 --> 27:27.729
This is the security camera footage
from the sacred demonstration site

27:27.812 --> 27:30.482
where Sinner Park Jungja's remains
were kept

27:30.565 --> 27:33.234
after her demonstration eight years ago.

27:33.985 --> 27:35.904
Four years after the demonstration,

27:36.696 --> 27:40.283
Sinner Park Jungja rose from the dead
in the exact same place.

27:41.201 --> 27:42.744
<i>Over the last four years,</i>

27:43.453 --> 27:46.289
<i>through intensive interviews</i>
<i>with Park Jungja</i>

27:46.373 --> 27:48.041
<i>and various studies about the case,</i>

27:49.000 --> 27:53.755
<i>we have discovered the message</i>
<i>that God wishes to send us through her.</i>

27:55.507 --> 27:58.718
Therefore, we, the New Truth,
hereby declare Park Jungja

27:58.802 --> 28:01.513
no longer a sinner
but the Resurrected One.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.767
In three months, we will announce
the new revelations of God's will,

28:05.850 --> 28:08.436
bestowed upon us through Park Jungja,

28:08.978 --> 28:13.358
and thereby restore His sacred will,
which was tainted by a faithless mob.

28:13.441 --> 28:17.445
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One,
will announce God's will herself

28:17.529 --> 28:21.241
at our upcoming grand revival meeting
in three months.

28:22.534 --> 28:26.538
The New Truth will call it "the New Will."

28:27.038 --> 28:30.458
<i>We hope proclaiming the New Will</i>
<i>enlightens not only our fellow citizens</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:34.045
<i>but also people worldwide, fostering</i>
<i>a better understanding of God's will.</i>

28:34.546 --> 28:36.840
<i>May it inspire all</i>
<i>to further virtuous acts</i>

28:36.923 --> 28:38.967
<i>and embody righteousness in their lives.</i>

28:39.843 --> 28:43.596
<i>Lastly, details regarding</i>
<i>the grand revival meeting…</i>

28:46.015 --> 28:48.977
That's a bold move by Kim Jeongchil.

28:49.477 --> 28:52.731
This means we have to find others
who were resurrected.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.608
The demonstration subjects
are scattered all over the place.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.152
Makes them hard to track.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.279
We can't just do nothing.

29:06.953 --> 29:09.497
Excuse me. Something is up with Jaehyeon.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.300
What's she doing?

29:22.010 --> 29:23.553
Damn, what's she got there?

29:42.155 --> 29:44.657
Bae Jaehyeon, what's that in your hand?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.003
Where did you get that?

29:58.755 --> 29:59.672
I found it

30:00.757 --> 30:03.968
when I went out for a walk earlier.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.063
You should all go.

30:25.907 --> 30:27.075
Can I take a look?

30:29.285 --> 30:30.453
Wow, what is it?

30:31.996 --> 30:34.040
Solar Train.

30:34.749 --> 30:35.875
"Solar Train"?

30:35.959 --> 30:36.793
Yes.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.885
SOLAR TRAIN
GOING ON A BRAVE ADVENTURE!

30:47.178 --> 30:50.557
You read this to me before. <i>Solar Train</i>.

30:51.391 --> 30:54.435
The five of them are a team.

30:55.186 --> 30:57.021
This is Happy Train.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.692
Don't you remember?

31:01.818 --> 31:03.319
You're right. I remember.

31:03.403 --> 31:04.612
Yes, <i>Solar Train</i>.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.198
Didn't these guys get energy
from sunlight?

31:08.241 --> 31:12.328
Not sunlight but the solar energy
of love from the sunlight.

31:12.412 --> 31:15.039
These train heroes
recharge their energy with it.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.209
This one is Power.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.629
These are Smart, Thunder, and Funny.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.008
You said Funny was your favorite.

31:25.508 --> 31:28.720
Later on, they combine into one.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.139
And when they do, they get really tall!

31:31.222 --> 31:33.600
Probably as tall as you, Aunt Hyejin.

31:55.288 --> 31:57.498
How long do we have to keep
Jaehyeon like this?

31:57.999 --> 31:58.833
What do you mean?

31:59.876 --> 32:02.003
She's completely cut off from the world,

32:02.086 --> 32:05.256
getting DNA tests, blood tests,
and psychological tests every month.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.550
It's not normal.

32:10.887 --> 32:14.515
We need to find something
which explains the current situation.

32:15.016 --> 32:19.020
Jaehyeon is just an ordinary child
who needs to be loved.

32:19.687 --> 32:22.106
We can't make her live like this forever.

32:22.815 --> 32:26.486
She's only five,
so let's not jump to conclusions.

32:27.403 --> 32:30.156
"We must pursue the truth persistently
without rushing."

32:31.366 --> 32:33.326
Isn't that what you always say?

32:33.952 --> 32:37.622
That only applies
when there's actually a truth to pursue.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.792
Even if she's just an ordinary child,

32:40.875 --> 32:43.461
she must grow up
to be the symbol of our organization.

32:44.420 --> 32:47.382
She will be
our most powerful ideological weapon.

32:48.257 --> 32:52.178
And we lost six of our members
just to save that one child.

32:58.434 --> 33:00.395
It's all set. Could you please check?

33:00.478 --> 33:02.146
All right. Give me a minute.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.942
This is equipment
used for nature documentaries.

33:06.025 --> 33:09.404
It works by detecting
specific sounds, lights, or motion.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.532
We don't know
when Jung Jinsu will be resurrected,

33:12.615 --> 33:15.243
but if something happens here,
we'll know right away.

33:15.743 --> 33:19.872
But we'll need someone here at all times
if we are to secure him.

33:20.665 --> 33:22.917
We don't know when it's going to happen,

33:23.418 --> 33:26.045
and, for security reasons,
we can't have many people on shift.

33:27.380 --> 33:28.715
One person will do the job.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.633
He'll be living nearby.

33:31.134 --> 33:31.968
One person?

33:32.677 --> 33:35.638
He would wait a hundred years
by himself if he had to.

33:37.223 --> 33:38.391
Who is he?

33:39.225 --> 33:42.437
Let's just say he wants to meet
Jung Jinsu more than anyone.

33:43.938 --> 33:46.232
Actually, there he is.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.744
Hello, Ms. Min Hyejin.

33:57.827 --> 33:58.661
Well,

33:59.495 --> 34:00.830
I'm Cheon Sehyeong.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.427
3 MONTHS LATER

34:43.706 --> 34:44.791
MOTION DETECTED

34:53.674 --> 34:54.509
SECURITY CAMERA

34:59.388 --> 35:00.389
He's here.

36:04.537 --> 36:09.250
JUNG JINSU HAS RESURRECTED

36:21.554 --> 36:22.388
Excuse me.

36:23.806 --> 36:24.807
Are you all right?

36:26.726 --> 36:27.560
Excuse me.

36:35.318 --> 36:36.152
Jung…

36:39.280 --> 36:40.448
Jung Jin…

36:42.074 --> 36:43.618
Chairman Jung Jinsu!

36:47.455 --> 36:48.372
Chairman Jung!

36:53.794 --> 36:54.962
Chairman Jung!

39:31.952 --> 39:35.956
