WEBVTT

01:16.201 --> 01:18.533
This is berk,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.703
the best kept secret
this side of, well...

01:21.790 --> 01:23.576
Anywhere.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.248
Granted, it may not look like much,

01:25.335 --> 01:26.575
but this wet heap of rock

01:26.670 --> 01:28.877
packs more than a few surprises.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.543
Life here is amazing,

01:36.638 --> 01:39.345
just not for the faint of heart.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.391
You see, where most folks
enjoy hobbies like whittling

01:42.477 --> 01:45.594
or needlepoint,
we berkians prefer...

01:47.232 --> 01:50.349
A little something we like to call...

01:52.362 --> 01:55.149
Dragon racing!

02:06.585 --> 02:08.576
Whoa-ho-ho! Ho-ho!

02:08.670 --> 02:11.958
I'm sorry, fishlegs,
did you want that?

02:12.049 --> 02:15.633
Oh, snotlout, that was mine!

02:15.719 --> 02:17.129
Here you go, babe.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.006
Did I tell you that
you look amazing today?

02:19.097 --> 02:20.177
- 'Cause you do.
- Ugh!

02:20.265 --> 02:21.505
Come on, barf.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.181
It's starting
to stink around here.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.508
Nope, still hates you.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.184
Let's blow this place, belch!

02:26.271 --> 02:27.511
Aah!

02:27.606 --> 02:29.437
All right!

02:29.524 --> 02:31.264
Come on!

02:34.946 --> 02:36.311
Oh, yeah!

02:36.406 --> 02:37.771
Ah, ha-ha!

02:37.866 --> 02:39.857
That's nine for the twins!

02:39.951 --> 02:42.033
Astrid lags with three!

02:42.120 --> 02:45.863
Fishlegs and snotlout
trail with none!

02:45.957 --> 02:47.743
And hiccup is...

02:49.127 --> 02:51.459
Nowhere to be found. Hmm.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.084
Scared him off with the big
talk, didn't you, stoick?

02:56.259 --> 02:57.999
What are you doing, snotlout?

02:58.095 --> 02:59.631
They're gonna win now.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.178
She's my Princess... whatever
she wants, she gets.

03:02.265 --> 03:05.098
Ruffnut? Didn't she try
to bury you alive?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.551
Only for a few hours.

03:07.646 --> 03:09.011
Look at 'em go!

03:09.106 --> 03:10.516
Now, dragons used to be

03:10.607 --> 03:12.063
a bit of a problem here,

03:12.150 --> 03:14.061
but that was five years ago.

03:14.152 --> 03:16.234
Now they've all moved in.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.687
And, really, why wouldn't they?

03:18.782 --> 03:20.773
We have custom stables,

03:20.867 --> 03:22.823
all-you-can-eat
feeding stations,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.994
a full-service dragon wash...

03:26.081 --> 03:27.992
Even top-of-the-line
fire prevention,

03:28.083 --> 03:30.324
if I do say so myself.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.376
Ah, it's time, gobber.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.169
Righty-ho. Last lap!

03:39.511 --> 03:41.923
The black sheep!
Come on, stormfly!

03:42.013 --> 03:44.846
We can still win this thing!

03:46.101 --> 03:47.511
- Come on, barf!
- Let's go!

03:48.562 --> 03:50.473
Go, meatlug!

03:50.564 --> 03:52.395
Let's go, let's go!

03:52.482 --> 03:53.312
Ha-ha!

03:53.400 --> 03:55.732
This is your big moment.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.980
Have a nice flight.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.027
Up! Up, up, up, up, up!

04:07.205 --> 04:09.537
Good job, meatlug!

04:09.624 --> 04:11.990
Here you go, darling.
Mine's worth ten.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.996
Yeah! The black sheep!

04:15.338 --> 04:17.829
You guys are fighting
for ruffnut?

04:17.924 --> 04:20.131
- I'm totally winning!
- We're winning together.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.256
Oh, no!

04:25.056 --> 04:27.798
- Whoo! No one can stop me now!
- Except for me.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.383
We're attached, genius.

04:29.478 --> 04:31.093
Quit trying to steal - hey!

04:31.188 --> 04:33.554
All my glory!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.434
- Get them, Astrid!
- It's my glory!

04:35.525 --> 04:38.062
- Always ruining everything!
- No, sheep, no glory!

04:38.153 --> 04:40.610
Gotcha! Ha-ha!

04:40.697 --> 04:42.107
- Whoal!
- Astrid!

04:42.199 --> 04:43.439
Well played!

04:44.785 --> 04:47.401
That's my future
daughter-in-law!

04:48.914 --> 04:49.914
Whoo-hoo!

04:51.041 --> 04:52.406
Uh, excuse me.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.707
Stormfly!

04:57.380 --> 04:59.245
Whoal

05:01.468 --> 05:02.468
aah!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.091
That's 13!

05:07.182 --> 05:09.173
Astrid takes the game!

05:11.353 --> 05:13.639
Yep,
berk is pretty much perfect.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.933
All of my hard work
has paid off.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.730
And it's a good thing, too,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.658
because with vikings
on the backs of dragons...

05:21.029 --> 05:23.486
The world just got
a whole lot bigger.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.788
Yeah!

06:23.675 --> 06:25.586
So, what do you think, bud?

06:25.677 --> 06:27.713
You want to give this
another shot?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.883
Toothless! It'll be fine.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.102
Ready?

06:37.188 --> 06:40.305
Aah...l

06:42.277 --> 06:44.393
yeah...

06:44.487 --> 06:46.694
Whoo-hoo!

06:48.325 --> 06:49.861
Yeah!

06:57.918 --> 06:58.953
Whoal

07:13.433 --> 07:15.219
Oh...

07:17.562 --> 07:19.894
Whoo-hoo!

07:20.732 --> 07:22.438
Whoal

07:23.610 --> 07:25.726
yeah!

07:25.820 --> 07:27.651
Whoo!

07:28.865 --> 07:31.072
This is amazing!

07:31.159 --> 07:33.024
No longer amazing.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.154
Toothless!

07:36.873 --> 07:38.113
Oh, no!

07:38.208 --> 07:40.699
Oh! Aah!

07:44.798 --> 07:46.038
Aah! Whoal

07:55.934 --> 07:57.174
Whoo!

07:57.268 --> 07:59.509
That really came out of nowhere.

08:06.111 --> 08:09.399
We-we got to work on
your solo gliding there, bud.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.445
That, uh, locked-up tail

08:11.533 --> 08:14.696
makes for some pretty sloppy
rescue maneuvers, hey?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.797
Ah!

08:32.887 --> 08:35.219
Looks like we found
another one, bud.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.511
Oh...

08:39.436 --> 08:41.222
Oh, what, do you
want an apology?

08:42.564 --> 08:43.849
Is that why you're pouting,

08:43.940 --> 08:45.100
big baby boo?

08:46.568 --> 08:47.899
Well, try this on!

08:49.404 --> 08:51.520
Oh, you feeling it yet? Huh?

08:51.614 --> 08:54.071
Picking up on all
my heartfelt remorse?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.493
Ah. Yeah. Oh, come on, come on,

08:58.580 --> 09:00.946
you-you wouldn't hurt
a one-legged...

09:01.041 --> 09:02.372
Uh...

09:02.459 --> 09:03.824
Y-you're right, you're right.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.374
You win. You win.

09:05.462 --> 09:07.273
Whoa-whoa-whoa...

09:07.297 --> 09:08.207
He's down!

09:08.298 --> 09:10.163
And it's ugly!

09:10.258 --> 09:11.668
Dragons and vikings...

09:11.760 --> 09:13.170
Enemies again...

09:13.261 --> 09:15.468
Locked in combat
to the bitter...

09:15.555 --> 09:17.420
Oh...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.011
You know that doesn't wash out.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.209
So, what should we name it?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.754
"Itchy armpit” it is.

09:56.471 --> 09:57.711
What do you reckon, bud?

09:58.098 --> 10:00.885
Think we might find a few
timberjacks in those woods?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.512
The odd whispering death
or two in the rocks?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.891
Who knows, maybe
we'll finally track down

10:07.982 --> 10:09.597
another night fury.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.816
Wouldn't that be something.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.895
So, what do you say?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.399
Just keep going?

10:26.501 --> 10:28.082
Afternoon, milady.

10:28.169 --> 10:32.082
- Where have you been?
- Hi.

10:32.173 --> 10:35.415
Oh, winning races. What else?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.717
The real question is,

10:37.804 --> 10:38.964
where have you been?

10:39.055 --> 10:42.013
- Avoiding my dad.
- Oh, no. What happened now?

10:42.100 --> 10:44.466
Oh, you're gonna...
You're gonna love this.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.472
I wake up, the sun's shining,

10:46.563 --> 10:48.053
terrible terrors are

10:48.148 --> 10:49.228
singing on the rooftop,

10:49.315 --> 10:50.805
I saunter down to breakfast

10:50.900 --> 10:54.017
thinking all is right
with the world, and I get:

10:54.112 --> 10:56.103
"Son, we need to talk."

10:56.197 --> 10:59.815
"Not, now, dad. I got a
whole day of goofing off to get started.”

10:59.909 --> 11:01.865
Okay, first of alll,

11:01.953 --> 11:04.285
I-I don't sound like that.
What is this character?

11:04.372 --> 11:06.283
And-and second...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.581
What is that thing you're
doing with my shoulders?

11:08.668 --> 11:12.001
Yeah, that's-that's a really
flattering impersonation.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.953
Anyway, he goes...

11:14.048 --> 11:16.164
"You're the pride of berk, son,

11:16.259 --> 11:19.501
- and I couldn't be prouder.”
- Aw, thanks, dad.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.338
I'm pretty impressed
with myself, too.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.219
When have I ever
done that with my hands?

11:25.310 --> 11:26.800
You just did!

11:26.895 --> 11:28.726
Okay, just...

11:28.813 --> 11:30.223
Hold... still.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.769
- Very serious.
- Mm-hmm.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.484
"You're all grown up,

11:37.572 --> 11:40.279
"and since no chief could ask
for a better successor,

11:40.366 --> 11:43.779
- I've decided..."
- To make you chief! Oh, my gods!

11:43.870 --> 11:45.076
Hiccup, that's amazing!

11:45.163 --> 11:46.573
Oh...!

11:46.664 --> 11:48.950
Y-you're gonna wear
out the spring coil.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.328
The calibration
is very sensitive.

11:55.924 --> 11:58.836
Yeah, so... this is

11:58.927 --> 12:00.212
what I'm dealing with.

12:01.387 --> 12:02.387
What did you tell him?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.928
I-I didn't.

12:04.015 --> 12:06.176
By the time he turned
around, I was gone.

12:06.267 --> 12:09.930
Huh. Well...
It's a lot of responsibility.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.307
The map will have
to wait, for sure,

12:12.398 --> 12:13.888
and... and I'll need

12:13.983 --> 12:16.725
to fly toothless,
since you'll be too busy, but...

12:20.490 --> 12:22.651
I-it's not me, Astrid.

12:22.742 --> 12:27.111
All those speeches and planning
and running the village, that's his thing.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.366
I think you're
missing the point.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.867
I mean... chief.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.415
What an honor!

12:32.502 --> 12:33.867
I'd be pretty excited.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.749
L-I... I'm not like you.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.046
You... know exactly who you are,

12:39.133 --> 12:41.499
you always have, but...

12:41.594 --> 12:43.550
I'm still looking.

12:43.638 --> 12:46.254
I know that I'm not my father,

12:46.349 --> 12:49.307
and I never met my mother, so...

12:49.394 --> 12:51.476
What does that make me?

12:57.318 --> 13:01.402
What you're searching for
isn't out there, hiccup...

13:01.489 --> 13:03.025
It's in here.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.149
Maybe you just don't see it yet.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.076
- Ugh. Ugh!
- Maybe.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.824
But, you know...

13:10.915 --> 13:13.657
There is something out there.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.537
Hiccup...

13:44.615 --> 13:46.480
Wow...

13:49.954 --> 13:51.444
Stay close.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.629
What happened here?

14:11.476 --> 14:14.013
All right, e-easy, bud.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.468
Hiccup!

14:15.563 --> 14:18.054
- Fire!
- Astrid, look out!

14:21.361 --> 14:23.022
Aah! Hiccup!

14:27.950 --> 14:29.406
W atch the tail!

14:31.079 --> 14:32.944
Tie those legs up!

14:34.707 --> 14:36.368
Huh?

14:36.459 --> 14:39.451
- Is that what I think it is?
- Stop!

14:39.545 --> 14:41.126
Stormfly!

14:41.214 --> 14:42.670
What are you doing?

14:42.757 --> 14:44.247
Ooh!

14:44.342 --> 14:46.549
Back again!

14:48.388 --> 14:50.379
Soil my britches.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.089
That is a night fury.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.220
Thought they were
all gone for good.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.394
Looks like our luck's had
a turn for the better, lads!

14:58.481 --> 15:00.346
Don't think drago
has one of those...

15:00.441 --> 15:02.181
In his dragon army.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.436
Dragon army?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.522
Look, we don't want any trouble.

15:05.613 --> 15:08.104
Hah! You should
have thought of that

15:08.199 --> 15:10.440
before you stole
all of our dragons

15:10.535 --> 15:12.241
and blasted our fort to bits!

15:12.328 --> 15:13.806
- That's right!
- Yeah, look it at!

15:13.830 --> 15:15.036
Wait.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.329
What are you talking about?

15:16.416 --> 15:17.826
You think we did this?

15:17.917 --> 15:21.626
Hah! Dragon trapping is
hard enough work as it is

15:21.712 --> 15:23.919
without do-gooder dragon riders

15:24.006 --> 15:27.874
- sneaking in to rescue them.
- What do-gooder...?

15:27.969 --> 15:30.756
There are other dragon riders?
You mean

15:30.847 --> 15:33.634
other than your thieving friend
from last night? You tell me.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.716
You may have
an ice-spitting dragon on your side,

15:36.811 --> 15:39.177
but we still have
a quota to fill.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.479
How do you suppose
we explain this mess

15:41.566 --> 15:42.897
to drago bludvist?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.520
Drago what-fist?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.521
Does anything you say
make sense?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.318
He's expecting
a new shipment of dragons

15:48.406 --> 15:50.567
for his army by tomorrow.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.196
And drago don't
take well to excuses!

15:54.287 --> 15:56.027
This is what he gave me

15:56.122 --> 15:58.454
last time I showed up
empty-handed.

15:58.541 --> 16:02.580
He promised to be far less
understanding in the future.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.412
All right, look, we don't know
anything about a dragon thief

16:05.506 --> 16:08.748
or an ice-spitting dragon
or your lunatic boss

16:08.843 --> 16:11.050
and his dragon army, okay?

16:11.137 --> 16:14.129
Just give us back our dragon,
and we'll go...

16:14.223 --> 16:16.930
Strange, hostile person
whom we've never met.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.929
Oh, where are my manners?

16:19.020 --> 16:20.385
I'm eret...

16:20.480 --> 16:23.142
Son of eret.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.769
Finest dragon trapper alive.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.816
- Yeah.
- After all...

16:27.904 --> 16:31.192
It's not just anyone
who can capture a night fury.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.273
And this is toothless.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.608
He says we're going. Now.

16:35.703 --> 16:36.783
Hah!

16:36.871 --> 16:38.281
They all say that.

16:38.372 --> 16:39.657
Rush 'em, lads!

16:47.298 --> 16:49.289
Stormfly, come on! Go! Go!

16:53.554 --> 16:56.091
You will never hold on
to those dragons!

16:56.182 --> 16:57.513
You hear me?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.216
Drago is coming for them all!

17:02.980 --> 17:06.598
Come on, meatlug! Whoo-hoo!
Yahoo!

17:15.201 --> 17:16.303
- Hey there, stoick!
- Hey, how are you?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.817
Beautiful day.

17:17.912 --> 17:19.952
- Hello, spitelout. Great race.
- Yeah...

17:20.039 --> 17:21.654
Oh! Sorry, Mrs. ack.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.286
- Any sign of him?
- Eh! He's probably flown

17:24.377 --> 17:26.663
off the edge
of the world by now.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.995
You sure you want that kid
running the village?

17:29.090 --> 17:31.126
You can still delay
your retirement.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.799
Oh, he's ready. You'll see.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.343
There he is!

17:36.430 --> 17:39.593
Huh? The pride of berk!

17:40.560 --> 17:43.677
Who finally decided
to show up for work. Yay.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.432
Sorry, got held up.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.933
Hey, uh, dad,
could I have a word?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.764
Something you're
itching to tell me?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.441
Uh, not quite the itch
you're thinking of, but, yes.

17:51.529 --> 17:52.689
Oh, good man!

17:52.780 --> 17:55.362
Now, lesson one:
A chief's first duty

17:55.449 --> 17:57.360
is to his people, so... 41!

17:57.451 --> 17:59.191
Well, can we just
talk in private for...

17:59.287 --> 18:00.347
- Forty...
- That's me!

18:00.371 --> 18:01.531
That's me! I'm next!

18:01.622 --> 18:02.724
Hey, I was ahead of you!

18:02.748 --> 18:04.113
If we could just talk...

18:04.208 --> 18:06.119
Excuse me.
I've been here all day.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.542
Okay, okay, I want one
of those high seaters

18:08.629 --> 18:11.871
with lots of spikes and
a big storage compartment!

18:11.966 --> 18:15.254
- Absolutely! You got it, sir.
- Dad, this is actually

18:15.344 --> 18:17.072
a little more important
than building saddles.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.508
Ah, lesson two:
No task is too small

18:19.599 --> 18:21.385
when it comes
to serving your people.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.215
- But, dad...
- Oh, excuse us, grump.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.643
- Can we just talk...
- Yah! Grump!

18:25.730 --> 18:27.891
You let the forge
die down again!

18:30.985 --> 18:33.692
Ah...

18:33.779 --> 18:35.799
That's it, grump!
You're going up for adoption.

18:35.823 --> 18:37.233
- Okay, uh...
- There you go.

18:37.325 --> 18:39.566
- Dad... yeah, but seriously,
- Go on. Have away.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.994
I really need to tell you about
this new land we came across.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.821
- Another one?
- Any new dragons?

18:45.916 --> 18:47.656
We didn't stick
around to find out.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.368
These folks weren't
particularly friendly.

18:50.463 --> 18:51.669
Oh, really?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.872
Your night fury
and deadly nadder

18:53.966 --> 18:55.877
didn't bring them
cheering to the rooftops?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.299
No, this was different.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.719
Not the standard run-for-the-hills
hoo-ha I've come to enjoy.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.513
These guys were trappers.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.387
Dragon trappers.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.843
You should have seen their fort.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.849
All blown apart and stuck
in giant spikes of ice.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.225
It was weird.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.932
I've never seen
anything like it.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.518
A-and worst of all,
they thought we did it!

19:15.613 --> 19:18.320
You know, you two are gonna get
yourselves in serious trouble

19:18.407 --> 19:19.738
one of these days.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.033
Not everyone appreciates
this way of life.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.405
Aye, gobber's right, son.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.907
Best we keep to our own.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.990
Besides, you'll have more
important uses for your time.

19:29.085 --> 19:30.791
Huh-huh?

19:30.878 --> 19:33.665
Once we make
the big announcement!

19:34.507 --> 19:37.089
They are building a dragon army.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.715
Or-or at least the guy
they work for is. Uh...

19:41.806 --> 19:44.548
"Dargo... bloody fist"
or something.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.097
I'll bloody his fist
with my face

19:49.188 --> 19:50.644
if he tries to take my dragon!

19:50.731 --> 19:51.731
Or mine!

19:51.774 --> 19:53.355
Ugh! You're such a moron.

19:53.442 --> 19:54.648
A beautiful moron.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.100
Yeah.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.312
Bludvist? Drago bludvist?

19:59.407 --> 20:01.068
Uh, yeah. Wait...

20:01.742 --> 20:02.822
You know him?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.828
- Ground all dragons!
- What? Why?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.701
Seal the gates!

20:09.792 --> 20:11.895
Lower the storm doors!
'Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.397
- What is happening?
- Come on!

20:13.421 --> 20:14.786
You heard the man! Lock it down!

20:14.880 --> 20:18.372
No dragon or viking

20:18.467 --> 20:21.675
sets foot off this island
until I give the word!

20:21.762 --> 20:24.344
Wait, because some guy you knew
is stirring up trouble

20:24.432 --> 20:25.842
in some faraway land?

20:25.933 --> 20:28.015
Because drago bludvist
is a madman

20:28.102 --> 20:30.343
without conscience or mercy.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.645
And if he's built a dragon army,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.643
gods help us all.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.770
- Get them into their pens! Quickly!
- Aye, stoick.

20:36.861 --> 20:38.647
Then let's ride back out there.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.649
We'll follow those
trappers to drago

20:40.740 --> 20:42.401
and talk some sense into him.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.402
No. We fortify the island.

20:44.493 --> 20:46.029
It's our duty to keep the peace.

20:46.120 --> 20:47.701
Peace is over, hiccup.

20:47.788 --> 20:50.700
I must prepare you for war. War?

20:50.791 --> 20:53.578
Dad, if drago's
coming for our dragons,

20:53.669 --> 20:55.876
we can't wait around
for him to get here.

20:55.963 --> 20:59.251
Let's go find him
and change his mind.

20:59.341 --> 21:01.206
No, some minds
won't be changed, hiccup.

21:01.302 --> 21:03.634
Berk is what you need
to worry about.

21:03.721 --> 21:06.178
A chief protects his own.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.140
Secure the stables!
Latch every stall!

21:10.227 --> 21:12.138
- Hiccup, don't.
- I have to.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.560
This way!

21:13.647 --> 21:14.967
Quickly!

21:16.150 --> 21:18.061
Hiccup!

21:19.737 --> 21:20.852
Come on!

21:22.281 --> 21:24.192
- Hiccup!
- Aah!

21:34.794 --> 21:37.001
Keep your eyes peeled, lads!

21:37.087 --> 21:39.999
With this wind,
we'll reach drago by daybreak.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.752
So best we fill this ship up
with dragons, and quick!

21:42.843 --> 21:44.208
It's no time to be picky!

21:44.303 --> 21:45.588
Uh, eret?

21:45.679 --> 21:47.920
Not if we want to keep our...

21:49.350 --> 21:50.590
Heads!

21:50.684 --> 21:52.470
Off the port quarter!

21:52.561 --> 21:54.722
Net them, lads! Take them down!

21:54.814 --> 21:57.146
There's two of them!
Up on the left!

21:58.859 --> 22:00.315
You're not
getting away this time.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.517
Fire!

22:01.612 --> 22:03.443
Reload! Reload!

22:03.531 --> 22:06.739
Come on, reload! Incoming!

22:06.826 --> 22:08.066
Steady yourselves, mates.

22:08.118 --> 22:10.234
And here I was,

22:10.329 --> 22:12.570
worried we might turn up
empty-handed.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.656
Nope. It's your lucky day.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.160
We give up.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.159
That's one night fury,

22:19.255 --> 22:21.792
uh, one deadly nadder, and...

22:21.882 --> 22:24.840
Two of the finest dragon
riders west of luk tuk.

22:24.927 --> 22:26.588
That ought to make the boss
happy, right?

22:27.888 --> 22:29.298
Excuse us.

22:29.390 --> 22:30.596
What are you doing?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.344
Toothless, stay.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.634
Uh, the dragons
don't really care

22:35.729 --> 22:38.141
for cramped spaces,
so they'll just hang out with you.

22:38.232 --> 22:39.642
They won't be any trouble.

22:40.901 --> 22:43.062
Unless you do that.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.394
You know, wooden boats,
big ocean...

22:45.489 --> 22:47.229
H-how is your swimming?

22:47.324 --> 22:48.780
Not good.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.775
Oops. Almost forget.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.157
- Can't have armed prisoners.
- Give me that.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.829
How is this a plan?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.749
Just what every
dragon trapper needs.

22:58.836 --> 23:02.124
One end coats the blade
in monstrous nightmare saliva.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.001
The other sprays
hideous zippleback gas.

23:05.092 --> 23:07.708
All it takes is a spark, and...

23:08.888 --> 23:10.298
Oh, yeah, there you go.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.843
Once they see you
as one of their own,

23:13.934 --> 23:15.203
even the testiest dragons
can be trained.

23:15.227 --> 23:16.307
Right, bud?

23:16.395 --> 23:19.353
Give me that!

23:19.440 --> 23:21.351
What game are you playing?

23:21.442 --> 23:23.683
Uh, no game.
We just want to meet drago.

23:23.777 --> 23:25.392
Why?

23:25.487 --> 23:27.944
Because I'm going to change
his mind about dragons.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.779
He can be really persuasive.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.361
Once you've earned his loyalty,

23:35.456 --> 23:38.038
there is nothing a dragon
won't do for you.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.333
You won't be changing
any minds around here.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.833
I can change yours,
right here, right now.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.666
Uh, may I?

23:48.761 --> 23:49.876
Waah!

23:52.431 --> 23:54.672
- Watch it!
- Dragon riders!

24:02.232 --> 24:03.392
Put me down!

24:03.484 --> 24:05.520
Snotlout,
what-what are you doing?

24:05.611 --> 24:07.397
See how well I protect
and provide?

24:08.781 --> 24:09.925
What is with all the nets?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.655
Hey, watch it! That was...

24:11.742 --> 24:14.108
Close.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.162
Oh, my.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.167
Me likey.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.920
Take me.

24:33.055 --> 24:34.295
Hold your fire!

24:39.186 --> 24:40.972
Um, what are you guys
doing here?

24:41.063 --> 24:43.179
We're here to rescue you!

24:43.273 --> 24:44.888
I don't need to be rescued.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.724
Enough!

24:47.820 --> 24:50.186
Well, didn't you just pick

24:50.280 --> 24:51.986
the wrong ship, eh?

24:52.074 --> 24:53.780
I am eret, son of...

24:53.867 --> 24:54.867
Eret...

24:59.039 --> 25:01.200
Get this thing off me.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.781
Anyone else?

25:02.876 --> 25:04.707
Hmm, that's what I figured.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.751
You, saddle up.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.954
We're going home.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.004
No.

25:10.092 --> 25:11.878
Of all the irresponsible...

25:11.969 --> 25:14.881
I'm trying to protect
our dragons and stop a war.

25:14.972 --> 25:16.178
How is that irresponsible?

25:16.265 --> 25:18.722
Because war
is what he wants, son!

25:24.773 --> 25:27.640
Years ago, there was
a great gathering of chieftains

25:27.735 --> 25:30.272
to discuss the dragon scourge
we all faced.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.731
Into our midst came a stranger
from a strange land,

25:34.825 --> 25:38.443
covered in scars and draped
in a cloak of dragon skin.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.282
He carried no weapon

25:41.373 --> 25:42.909
and spoke softly,

25:43.000 --> 25:44.331
saying that he,

25:44.418 --> 25:46.534
drago bluavist,

25:46.628 --> 25:48.664
was a man of the people,

25:48.756 --> 25:53.341
devoted to freeing mankind
from the tyranny of dragons.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.668
He claimed that he alone
could control the dragons,

25:55.763 --> 25:58.129
and that he alone
could keep us safe,

25:58.223 --> 26:01.306
if we chose to bow down

26:01.393 --> 26:04.806
and follow him.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.480
- Stupid.
- Ah, good one.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.728
Aye, we laughed, too...

26:10.819 --> 26:12.275
Until he wrapped himself
in his cloak

26:12.362 --> 26:13.647
and cried out,

26:13.739 --> 26:15.525
“then see how well you do
without me!”

26:15.616 --> 26:17.218
See how well you do without me!

26:17.242 --> 26:20.234
The rooftop suddenly burst
into flames,

26:20.329 --> 26:23.992
and from it,
armored dragons descended,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.199
burning the hall to the ground.

26:30.047 --> 26:32.584
Was the only one to escape.

26:37.387 --> 26:41.221
Men who kill without reason
cannot be reasoned with.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.048
- Maybe.
- Hiccup!

26:43.143 --> 26:45.179
I'm still going to try.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.728
This is what I'm good at,

26:48.816 --> 26:50.727
and-and if I could change your mind,

26:51.568 --> 26:53.308
I can change his, too.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.353
Come on.

26:57.533 --> 26:58.613
- Let's go.
- No!

26:58.700 --> 27:00.486
Lead the others back to berk.

27:00.577 --> 27:03.068
I've had enough mutiny
for one day.

27:05.499 --> 27:07.114
Ooh, I like that.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.824
Ruffnut!

27:08.919 --> 27:11.001
Okay!

27:11.755 --> 27:13.620
Ah.

27:31.441 --> 27:32.931
Don't worry, bud.

27:33.694 --> 27:36.060
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.486
I promise.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.871
Aw, come on, dad.

27:47.958 --> 27:49.573
Really?

27:57.634 --> 27:59.465
Okay.

27:59.553 --> 28:01.464
No sudden moves.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.114
Hold on, hold on.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.466
Toothless...!

29:29.643 --> 29:31.053
Hey!

29:31.144 --> 29:32.759
You left my dragon back there!

29:32.854 --> 29:35.311
He can't fly on his own!
He'll drown!

29:57.587 --> 29:59.669
Hey! Uh...

29:59.756 --> 30:01.712
We have to head back
for my dragon!

30:47.929 --> 30:49.260
Who are you?

30:50.349 --> 30:51.805
The dragon thief?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.341
Uh...

30:54.436 --> 30:55.846
Drago bludvist?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.519
Do you even understand

30:58.607 --> 30:59.938
what I'm saying?

31:05.614 --> 31:07.195
Toothless!

31:07.282 --> 31:09.944
Oh, it's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.071
I'm glad to see you, too, bud.

31:12.162 --> 31:13.442
You really had me worried there.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.116
Uh, uh...

31:58.792 --> 32:00.123
Oh...

32:00.210 --> 32:01.541
Hiccup?

32:01.628 --> 32:03.368
Uh...

32:06.466 --> 32:07.706
C-could it be?

32:09.010 --> 32:10.875
After all these years?

32:11.847 --> 32:13.553
How is this possible?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.301
Uh, should I...

32:16.143 --> 32:17.508
Should I know you?

32:18.770 --> 32:19.680
No.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.477
You were only a babe.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.770
But a mother never forgets.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.071
Shh, shh.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.412
Come.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.114
Boar-headed!

32:41.209 --> 32:42.619
Just like his mother!

32:42.711 --> 32:44.542
Aye, she could never
stay put, either.

32:44.629 --> 32:47.086
Eh, he's just 20, and a viking.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.415
I mean, could there be
a worse combination?

32:49.509 --> 32:52.125
Heh! When I think
of how stubborn and senseless

32:52.220 --> 32:54.586
you were back in the day.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.217
On.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.845
Well, not much
has changed, actually.

33:00.729 --> 33:03.971
Ah, you know what he's like.
He won't give up, gobber.

33:05.025 --> 33:08.893
And if hiccup finds drago
before we find him...

33:08.987 --> 33:10.602
Ah! Nothing can hurt hiccup,

33:10.697 --> 33:12.779
so long as that
night fury's around.

33:12.866 --> 33:14.151
It's a night fury!

33:17.662 --> 33:18.742
Huh?

33:34.471 --> 33:35.881
Find them, skullcrusher.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.471
Find them.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.722
Uh, h-hold on.
Wait just a minute.

33:47.817 --> 33:48.977
- This way.
- Come back here.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.775
- Come.
- You can't just say

33:50.862 --> 33:52.898
something like that and run off.

33:52.989 --> 33:54.479
You're my mother?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.984
I mean, what the...?

33:56.076 --> 33:58.067
Do you... do you grasp
how insane it sounds?

33:58.161 --> 33:59.367
Come quickly.

33:59.454 --> 34:00.534
I have questions!

34:00.622 --> 34:02.408
Where have you...

34:02.499 --> 34:04.410
Been all this time?

34:05.752 --> 34:07.367
What-what have you been doing?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.291
But they-they said
you were dead!

34:10.382 --> 34:12.714
Everyone thinks
you were eaten by...

34:53.967 --> 34:56.879
This is where you've been
for 20 years?

35:00.056 --> 35:01.842
You-you've been rescuing them.

35:05.437 --> 35:06.643
Unbelievable.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.311
You're not upset? What?

35:08.398 --> 35:10.059
No. I-l don't know. I...

35:10.150 --> 35:12.892
It's a bit much to get
my head around, to be frank.

35:12.986 --> 35:15.728
It's not every day you find out
your mother

35:15.822 --> 35:19.906
is some kind of crazy, feral,
vigilante dragon lady.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.200
On...

35:22.287 --> 35:23.948
Well...

35:24.039 --> 35:27.406
At least I'm not boring, right?

35:27.500 --> 35:29.456
Well, I suppose there is that...

35:30.295 --> 35:32.251
One specific thing.

35:32.339 --> 35:34.045
Do-do you like it?

35:36.551 --> 35:38.416
I-I don't have the words.

35:46.436 --> 35:48.597
C-canll...

35:48.688 --> 35:50.929
Oh, he's beautiful.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.434
On.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.225
Oh, incredible.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.942
He might very well be
the last of his kind.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.274
Oh... and look,

36:02.369 --> 36:03.950
he's your age.

36:04.037 --> 36:05.277
Wow.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.078
No wonder you get along so well.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.450
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

36:10.377 --> 36:12.959
And retractable teeth.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.454
How did you manage...

36:15.548 --> 36:17.288
I found him in the woods.

36:17.384 --> 36:20.217
He was shot down and wounded.

36:24.724 --> 36:26.680
This snafflefang lost his leg

36:26.768 --> 36:29.305
to one of drago bludvist's
iron traps.

36:29.396 --> 36:30.932
This raincutter

36:31.022 --> 36:33.138
had her wing sliced
by razor netting.

36:33.233 --> 36:36.350
And this, oh, poor hobblegrunt

36:36.444 --> 36:38.856
was blinded by a tree snare

36:38.947 --> 36:41.780
and then left to die
alone and scared.

36:42.784 --> 36:43.899
And what of this?

36:43.993 --> 36:46.826
Did drago or his trappers
do this, too?

36:46.913 --> 36:48.323
Oh.

36:48.415 --> 36:49.871
Yeah.

36:49.958 --> 36:53.542
Well, crazy thing is...

36:53.628 --> 36:57.496
I'm actually the one
who shot him down.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.172
Hey, it's-it's okay, though.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.260
He got me back.

37:01.344 --> 37:02.754
Right, bud?

37:02.846 --> 37:04.632
You couldn't save
all of me, could you?

37:04.723 --> 37:06.429
You just had to make it even.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.303
So peg leg.

37:13.022 --> 37:14.978
Uh...

37:15.066 --> 37:17.899
What did your father think
of your night fury friend?

37:17.986 --> 37:20.068
Oh, he-he didn't take
it all that well.

37:21.281 --> 37:23.943
But then, he changed.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.068
They all did.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.570
Pretty soon,

37:26.661 --> 37:29.403
everyone back home
had dragons of their own.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.613
If only it were possible.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.743
No, really.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.825
Believe me, I tried, as well,

37:34.919 --> 37:37.831
but people are not capable
of change, hiccup.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.287
Some of us...

37:39.382 --> 37:41.623
Were just born different.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.976
Berk was a land
of kill or be killed,

37:53.062 --> 37:55.303
but I believed peace
was possible.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.600
Stop! You'll only make it worse!

38:00.904 --> 38:03.236
It was a very unpopular opinion.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.360
Hiccup!

38:06.451 --> 38:08.191
Then one night,

38:08.286 --> 38:11.278
a dragon broke into our house,
finding you

38:11.372 --> 38:12.953
in the cradle.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.203
I rushed to protect you.

38:20.965 --> 38:25.208
But what I saw was proof
of everything I believed.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.686
This wasn't a vicious beast,

38:40.777 --> 38:43.644
but an intelligent, gentle creature,

38:43.738 --> 38:47.230
whose soul reflected my own.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.277
- Valka, run!
- No, don't.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.907
Oh...

38:57.001 --> 38:58.116
Hold on!

38:59.838 --> 39:02.170
No! Aah! Stoick!

39:02.257 --> 39:04.464
Valkal

39:05.468 --> 39:06.958
stoick!

39:09.264 --> 39:10.800
Valka.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.140
You and your father nearly died

39:14.227 --> 39:15.637
that night.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.595
All because I couldn't kill a dragon.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.932
Eh, runs in the family.

39:22.026 --> 39:24.483
It broke my heart to stay away,

39:24.571 --> 39:27.313
but I believed you'd be safer if I did.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.485
How did you survive?

39:30.577 --> 39:33.114
Oh, cloudjumper never meant
to harm me.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.989
He must have thought
I belonged here

39:37.083 --> 39:41.247
in the home of the
great bewilderbeast.

39:42.171 --> 39:44.162
The Alpha species.

39:44.257 --> 39:46.043
One of the very few

39:46.134 --> 39:47.965
that still exist.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.635
Every nest has its queen,

39:51.723 --> 39:55.181
but this is the king
of all dragons.

39:56.019 --> 39:57.429
With his icy breath,

39:57.520 --> 40:00.683
this graceful giant
built our nest,

40:00.773 --> 40:03.515
a safe haven for
dragons everywhere.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.066
Wait, that's the ice-spitter?

40:06.654 --> 40:08.895
He's responsible
for all that destruction?

40:08.990 --> 40:10.855
He protects us.

40:10.950 --> 40:13.157
We all live under his care

40:13.244 --> 40:15.030
and his command.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.039
All but the babies, of course...

40:23.004 --> 40:24.619
Who listen to no one.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.457
Aw...

40:38.519 --> 40:41.852
I've lived among them
for 20 years, hiccup,

40:41.940 --> 40:44.431
discovering their secrets.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.605
He likes you.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.232
Wow.

40:50.323 --> 40:51.654
You must be hungry.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.356
Uh, yeah, I could eat.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.451
Good.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.443
It's feeding time.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.536
I don't like it.

41:06.631 --> 41:08.713
They should've been back
with hiccup by now.

41:08.800 --> 41:09.915
I don't like it, either.

41:10.009 --> 41:11.070
Eret, son of eret,

41:11.094 --> 41:12.755
was the man of my dreams.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.210
My everything!

41:14.305 --> 41:16.591
But, baby,
I grew facial hair for you.

41:16.683 --> 41:18.469
Me, too.

41:18.559 --> 41:20.140
What if drago shot them down?

41:20.228 --> 41:22.765
What if they need our help?

41:22.855 --> 41:24.470
We have to find them.

41:24.565 --> 41:25.565
Wait, wait, what?

41:25.608 --> 41:26.723
No, but stoick said...

41:26.818 --> 41:28.024
It doesn't matter what he said

41:28.111 --> 41:29.271
if they've all been captured.

41:29.362 --> 41:30.522
Come on!

41:34.409 --> 41:35.615
Do we go back?

41:35.702 --> 41:37.238
We've nowhere to go,

41:37.328 --> 41:40.286
nothing to sell, and no heads
to call our own.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.829
- Uh, eret...?
- If we don't turn up

41:41.916 --> 41:44.328
with dragons and fast...

41:45.837 --> 41:47.702
Careful what you wish for!

41:47.797 --> 41:49.253
- Do something!
- Eret, son of eret!

41:49.340 --> 41:50.580
We'll miss you, eret!

41:50.675 --> 41:51.585
What is this?

41:51.676 --> 41:52.676
A kidnapping.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.300
Yay, can he ride with me?
Can he?

41:54.387 --> 41:55.422
Can he...?

41:56.973 --> 41:58.884
You're gonna show us
the way to drago.

41:58.975 --> 42:02.092
And help dragon riders
sneak into drago's camp?

42:02.186 --> 42:03.221
Just kill me now.

42:03.312 --> 42:04.312
That could be arranged.

42:04.397 --> 42:05.807
Stormfly, drop it.

42:05.898 --> 42:07.513
Huh?

42:08.484 --> 42:09.815
Good girl!

42:09.902 --> 42:12.894
Stormfly, fetch.

42:13.948 --> 42:14.948
All right!

42:15.033 --> 42:17.866
Okay! I'll take you to drago!

42:19.871 --> 42:21.486
Works every time.

42:29.756 --> 42:32.247
Hey, I-l thought
we were going to eat.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.047
Oh, we are.

43:04.749 --> 43:08.116
And then, from dragon island,
I found this archipelago...

43:15.134 --> 43:16.874
There.

43:16.969 --> 43:19.551
Whoa.

44:09.272 --> 44:11.183
Oh, when I'm up here,

44:11.274 --> 44:12.935
I don't even feel the cold.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.390
I just feel...

44:14.485 --> 44:15.850
Free.

44:19.574 --> 44:24.489
This is what it is
to be a dragon, hiccup.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.535
It's all well and good

44:26.622 --> 44:27.862
to call yourself a dragon,

44:27.957 --> 44:29.197
but can you fly?

44:50.771 --> 44:52.307
Oh, no! Aah!

45:03.075 --> 45:04.485
Man, almost!

45:04.577 --> 45:06.722
We just about had it that time.

45:12.084 --> 45:13.324
Incredible.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.001
Well, not bad yourself.

45:26.349 --> 45:29.716
All this time,
you took after me.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.596
And...

45:31.687 --> 45:33.018
Where was I?

45:35.399 --> 45:37.640
I'm so sorry, hiccup.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.147
Can we start over?

45:44.158 --> 45:45.898
Will you give me another chance?

45:48.496 --> 45:50.862
I-1 can teach you
all that I've learned

45:50.957 --> 45:53.824
these past 20 years.

45:53.918 --> 45:55.579
Like...

45:59.924 --> 46:01.004
Wow.

46:01.092 --> 46:03.333
Now you can make
those tight turns.

46:06.430 --> 46:07.545
Did you know about this?

46:07.640 --> 46:10.052
Every dragon

46:10.142 --> 46:12.383
has its secrets. And...

46:12.478 --> 46:14.389
I'll show them all to you.

46:15.022 --> 46:16.853
We'll unlock every mystery,

46:16.941 --> 46:19.933
find every last species...
Together, as mother and son.

46:26.701 --> 46:30.990
This gift we share, hiccup,
it bonds us.

46:31.831 --> 46:35.073
This is who you are, son.

46:35.167 --> 46:36.748
Who we are.

46:36.836 --> 46:40.624
We will change the world
for all dragons.

46:40.715 --> 46:43.297
We will make it a better,
safer place.

46:43.384 --> 46:44.794
Yeah, I mean,

46:44.885 --> 46:47.342
that sounds amazing.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.398
On, this is so great!

47:01.485 --> 47:04.602
Now you and I can go talk
to drago together.

47:04.697 --> 47:06.062
What?

47:06.157 --> 47:08.318
There's no talking to drago.

47:08.409 --> 47:09.694
- But we have to...
- No.

47:09.785 --> 47:12.071
We must protect our own.

47:12.163 --> 47:13.243
Come on.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.662
We should be getting back.

47:15.583 --> 47:16.618
Hmm?

47:29.638 --> 47:31.754
Okay, I got you here!

47:31.849 --> 47:33.089
Now get this thing off me.

47:33.184 --> 47:34.924
Never take a toy from a dragon.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.555
Don't you know anything?

47:37.980 --> 47:40.471
Why does this
keep happening to me?

47:54.830 --> 47:56.411
What's down there?

47:58.292 --> 47:59.532
Large-diameter bubbles,

47:59.627 --> 48:01.242
massive lungs,

48:01.337 --> 48:03.544
cold water deep dweller,
I'm thinking

48:03.631 --> 48:05.542
class five leviathan,

48:05.633 --> 48:07.089
maybe six.

48:10.763 --> 48:12.594
Yah!

48:21.982 --> 48:23.622
- Meatlug, what's wrong, girl?
- Hookfang!

48:23.651 --> 48:26.609
- Don't move!
- Uh...

48:41.585 --> 48:42.700
Drago!

48:47.091 --> 48:48.171
Get off me!

48:50.344 --> 48:52.505
Always great
to see you, my friend.

48:52.596 --> 48:54.712
Keeping warm up here?

48:58.185 --> 49:00.767
Well, as you can see,
I am right on time

49:00.855 --> 49:02.766
with a new batch of dragons,

49:02.857 --> 49:03.937
just like I promised.

49:04.024 --> 49:05.810
- He's waking up!
- Drop the ropes!

49:05.901 --> 49:07.186
Give me some backup here!

49:07.278 --> 49:08.734
Watch out!

49:08.821 --> 49:10.231
Drop the ropes.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.041
- Hookfang!
- Hey!

49:45.065 --> 49:46.350
What are you doing?

49:46.859 --> 49:49.976
You belong to me now.

49:51.363 --> 49:53.524
And as an added bonus,

49:53.616 --> 49:56.028
I also caught you their riders.

49:56.118 --> 49:58.029
No extra charge. What?

49:58.120 --> 49:59.576
Are you kidding me? Aw!

49:59.663 --> 50:01.654
But you were so perfect!

50:01.749 --> 50:04.081
Turns out there's a whole bunch
of them out there.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.928
They attacked...

50:06.670 --> 50:07.750
How many?

50:07.838 --> 50:10.375
Drago doesn't have them
after all.

50:10.466 --> 50:11.797
- How many?
- Hundreds.

50:11.884 --> 50:13.294
A whole island full.

50:13.385 --> 50:15.341
I wouldn't worry about it.

50:15.429 --> 50:18.671
My men are
hunting them down as we speak.

50:18.766 --> 50:20.302
They won't know
where you're hiding.

50:20.392 --> 50:21.848
I promise you that.

50:21.936 --> 50:23.927
Oh, yes, they will!
They know we're missing,

50:24.021 --> 50:26.057
and they have tracking dragons.

50:26.148 --> 50:28.639
If you so much as touch us,
hiccup is gonna kick...

50:28.734 --> 50:30.599
- Hiccup?
- He's not a problem.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.685
Really, trust me.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.941
He's only the son
of stoick the vast,

50:35.032 --> 50:36.943
his heir to the throne of berk,

50:37.034 --> 50:40.618
and the greatest dragon master
this world has ever seen.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.660
"Dragon master"?

50:42.748 --> 50:46.206
I alone control the dragons.

50:46.293 --> 50:48.079
- Nope, mm-mm.
- Sorry!

50:48.796 --> 50:52.129
And unless you let us go
right now,

50:52.216 --> 50:54.628
he will blast through here
on his night fury

50:54.718 --> 50:58.131
and blow your entire
fleet of ships to splinters.

50:58.222 --> 50:59.712
Then they'll be crying
like babies.

50:59.807 --> 51:01.172
Funny and beautiful.

51:01.267 --> 51:02.598
Good one, babe.

51:02.685 --> 51:05.267
Like babies, they always cry.

51:05.354 --> 51:06.560
Real tiny ones.

51:06.647 --> 51:08.888
First there was one rider,

51:08.983 --> 51:11.520
and now all of berk?

51:12.403 --> 51:14.394
And you led them to me!

51:14.488 --> 51:16.979
Drago...!

51:17.074 --> 51:20.066
Stop all preparations!

51:20.160 --> 51:24.073
We must attack
the dragon riders' nest at once!

51:24.164 --> 51:27.577
We will take down their Alpha.

51:27.668 --> 51:31.377
Then we will take berk!

51:32.756 --> 51:34.166
Drago!

51:34.258 --> 51:35.498
And get rid of him.

51:35.593 --> 51:38.505
Drago, please, I...

51:44.101 --> 51:45.966
Stormfly!

51:49.440 --> 51:51.226
No!

52:02.119 --> 52:04.235
Well, bud...

52:04.330 --> 52:07.367
We can't wait around for drago
to attack this place.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.289
We've got to find him first.

52:16.592 --> 52:17.592
Let's go.

52:19.928 --> 52:21.464
Easy now.

52:21.555 --> 52:23.591
Are you kidding me?
How did you get in here?

52:23.682 --> 52:25.042
The same way we're
getting you out.

52:25.100 --> 52:26.886
"We"? “All clear.

52:26.977 --> 52:28.246
- Toothless, come.
- Uh, wait, uh, wait...

52:28.270 --> 52:30.431
Okay, uh, dad,
there-there's something

52:30.522 --> 52:32.584
- you need to know.
- Yeah, yeah, tell me on the way.

52:32.608 --> 52:35.566
Well, this isn't an "on the way"
kind of update, actually.

52:35.653 --> 52:36.768
I've heard enough, hiccup.

52:36.862 --> 52:39.569
More-more of the earth-shattering
development variety.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.113
Yeah, just add it to pile.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.861
Yeah, I, uh, uh,

52:42.951 --> 52:46.068
dad, unlike most surprises
I spring on you,

52:46.163 --> 52:48.449
this is one you'll like,
I promise.

52:48.540 --> 52:50.496
You just have to
handle it delicately.

52:50.584 --> 52:52.449
So...

52:52.544 --> 52:54.284
Uh...

52:54.380 --> 52:57.543
You might want to take this one.

52:57.633 --> 52:59.248
Huh?

52:59.343 --> 53:01.004
Oh, boy.

53:01.095 --> 53:03.757
Oh, uh, dad,

53:03.847 --> 53:06.338
could you put
the sword away, please?

53:08.352 --> 53:10.468
On.

53:18.404 --> 53:21.646
I know what
you're gonna say, stoick.

53:22.366 --> 53:23.981
How could I have done this?

53:25.411 --> 53:27.322
Stayed away all of these years,

53:27.413 --> 53:29.404
and why didn't
I come back to you?

53:29.498 --> 53:31.409
To our son?

53:31.500 --> 53:32.706
Well...

53:32.793 --> 53:36.285
What sign did I have
that you could change, stoick?

53:36.380 --> 53:38.462
That anyone on berk could?

53:39.425 --> 53:41.711
I pleaded so many times

53:41.802 --> 53:43.713
to stop the fighting,
to find another answer,

53:43.804 --> 53:45.419
but did any of you listen?

53:45.514 --> 53:47.050
This is why I never married.

53:47.141 --> 53:50.099
This, and one other reason.

53:50.978 --> 53:54.562
I know that I left you
to raise hiccup alone,

53:54.648 --> 53:56.764
but I thought he'd be
better off without me,

53:57.735 --> 53:59.100
and I was wrong.

53:59.194 --> 54:00.809
I see that now, but...

54:00.904 --> 54:02.314
Onl

54:02.406 --> 54:05.148
stop being so stoic, stoick.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.608
Go on, shout, scream,

54:07.703 --> 54:09.568
say something!

54:13.834 --> 54:17.622
You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you.

54:50.329 --> 54:51.660
Move it.

54:51.747 --> 54:53.057
Could this day get any worse?

54:53.081 --> 54:54.081
Uh, let me see.

54:54.166 --> 54:55.477
We're gonna jump
into freezing cold water

54:55.501 --> 54:57.116
and then die from drowning.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.792
Looks refreshing.

54:58.879 --> 55:01.040
Please, ladies first.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.418
You are a steaming heap

55:04.510 --> 55:05.750
- of dragon...
- Duck.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.760
- Warn the others!
- Get them, you son of an eret.

55:14.353 --> 55:15.934
Take that!

55:23.028 --> 55:24.268
Okay, I love you again.

55:24.363 --> 55:26.319
Oh, pathetic.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.691
You can still jump.

55:27.783 --> 55:29.319
So, are we going to save
your dragons

55:29.409 --> 55:31.491
- and get out of here or not?
- Mm.

55:31.578 --> 55:32.988
Check every trap.

55:33.080 --> 55:34.945
They're here somewhere.

55:43.966 --> 55:45.251
Meatlug?

55:47.511 --> 55:48.511
Anyone coming?

55:48.595 --> 55:50.406
I don't know, you just keep
doing what you're doing.

55:50.430 --> 55:53.263
Keep cranking.

56:09.783 --> 56:12.946
Thank you for saving my life.

56:17.291 --> 56:19.031
Now let me return the favor.

56:19.918 --> 56:21.829
Mom, you'd never
even recognize it.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.785
Where we used to make weapons,

56:23.881 --> 56:26.623
we now build saddles,
wing slings...

56:26.717 --> 56:28.582
We-we even fix dragon teeth.

56:28.677 --> 56:31.089
You-you wouldn't believe
how much everything's changed.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.261
Aye, your son's changed berk
for the better.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.339
I think we did well
with this one, val.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.514
Thanks, dad.

56:37.769 --> 56:39.350
I got it.

56:39.438 --> 56:40.553
I got it.

56:51.867 --> 56:53.323
I'm, uh...

56:53.410 --> 56:54.775
A little out of practice.

56:54.870 --> 56:56.610
Well, you know,

56:56.705 --> 56:58.286
I didn't marry you
for your cooking.

56:58.373 --> 56:59.613
I hope not.

56:59.708 --> 57:01.915
Her meatballs
could kill more beasts

57:02.002 --> 57:03.617
than a battle ax.

57:03.712 --> 57:06.328
I've still got a few knocking
around in here.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.039
And once you move back in
with all your dragons,

57:09.134 --> 57:11.341
old drago won't even
stand a chance.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.884
Everything will be okay.

57:12.971 --> 57:14.507
Slow down, son.

57:15.265 --> 57:17.005
It's a lot to take in.

57:17.100 --> 57:19.216
Oh, gotcha.

57:26.902 --> 57:29.268
Oh, I love this one.

57:44.878 --> 57:46.743
Remember our song, val?

57:48.340 --> 57:51.628
J I'll swim and sail &

57:51.718 --> 57:54.960
j on savage seas j

57:56.473 --> 58:00.842

58:59.745 --> 59:03.863
j your mighty words astound me j

59:04.458 --> 59:07.291
j but I've no need

59:07.377 --> 59:09.288
j when I feel
your arms around me &

59:10.881 --> 59:13.213
j but I would bring

59:13.300 --> 59:15.632

“whoo!

59:15.719 --> 59:17.405

59:17.429 --> 59:21.342
j from all harm

59:21.433 --> 59:24.140

j I care not for your poetry &

- J' through all my sorrows j&

59:36.114 --> 59:38.230
j and your lights, I'll keep
your laugh inside me &

59:38.325 --> 59:40.065
j I'll swim and sail
the savage seas j

59:40.160 --> 59:42.242
j with ne'er a fear
of drowning &

59:42.329 --> 59:44.035
j and gladly ride
the waves of life j

59:44.122 --> 59:45.862
j if you will marry me! &

59:47.667 --> 59:49.353
> I'm still going... &

59:49.377 --> 59:50.457
gobber...

59:50.545 --> 59:51.955
I'm done.

59:54.424 --> 59:57.336
I thought I'd have to die before
we'd have that dance again.

59:57.427 --> 59:59.088
No need for drastic measures.

1:00:00.722 --> 1:00:01.962
For you, my dear...

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:04.844
Anything.

1:00:06.186 --> 1:00:07.847
Will you come home, val?

1:00:09.356 --> 1:00:11.642
Will you be my wife once again?

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:19.612
We can be a family!

1:00:19.699 --> 1:00:21.030
What do you say?

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:22.574
Well...

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:26.577
Yes...

1:00:28.333 --> 1:00:30.449
Great! I'll do the cooking.

1:00:32.379 --> 1:00:34.620
Thank Odin you didn't
listen to me, son.

1:00:34.714 --> 1:00:37.000
We never
would've found each other.

1:00:38.969 --> 1:00:40.675
Toothless?

1:00:44.141 --> 1:00:45.847
What's happening?

1:01:02.033 --> 1:01:03.523
Oh...

1:01:04.911 --> 1:01:08.028
Oh, no...

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:09.533
Val...

1:01:09.624 --> 1:01:11.535
Val, it's all right,
it's all right.

1:01:11.626 --> 1:01:13.036
We're a team now.

1:01:13.128 --> 1:01:14.368
Now, what do you want to do?

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:16.919
We have to save the dragons.

1:01:17.007 --> 1:01:19.293
Aye, you got it. Come on, son!

1:01:26.683 --> 1:01:28.389
Reload!

1:01:28.476 --> 1:01:29.841
Fire!

1:01:34.774 --> 1:01:36.856
Fire! Fire!

1:01:42.324 --> 1:01:45.191
Whatever comes,
keep hitting the mountain.

1:01:45.285 --> 1:01:48.197
We need to draw the Alpha out.

1:01:57.547 --> 1:01:59.629
Ready the traps!

1:02:14.648 --> 1:02:16.604
Surprise!

1:02:16.691 --> 1:02:18.227
Yeah!

1:02:18.318 --> 1:02:19.228
What?

1:02:19.319 --> 1:02:21.560
Waah! Waah! Ohl!

1:02:24.074 --> 1:02:26.315
You really are
full of surprises.

1:02:26.409 --> 1:02:27.774
Let's go.

1:02:27.869 --> 1:02:30.827
Dragon riders coming through!

1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:33.155
Fire!

1:02:37.921 --> 1:02:39.707
Oh, yeah!

1:02:39.798 --> 1:02:42.210
Look out!

1:02:45.553 --> 1:02:47.259
Cut them down!

1:02:50.350 --> 1:02:51.840
Eret, son of eret!

1:02:51.935 --> 1:02:53.675
Aah...!

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:04.645
Up, girl!

1:03:04.739 --> 1:03:05.899
Lean left, eret!

1:03:05.991 --> 1:03:07.197
That's it!

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:08.865
Look out!

1:03:17.335 --> 1:03:19.166
Yeah, baby!

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.547
Take them down!

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:26.340
Heads up!

1:03:33.435 --> 1:03:35.471
Dragon master.

1:03:36.396 --> 1:03:38.136
Welcome aboard, dragon rider.

1:03:38.231 --> 1:03:39.721
Thanks. I think.

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:41.431
Where have you been?

1:03:41.526 --> 1:03:44.438
Oh, you know,
catching up with mom.

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:57.822
That's your mother?

1:03:57.917 --> 1:04:00.533
Well, now you know
where I get my dramatic flair.

1:04:05.300 --> 1:04:06.836
The Alpha!

1:04:06.926 --> 1:04:09.212
Now we have a fight!

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:24.561
Come on, toothless.

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:26.734
Show them what you got, bud.

1:04:31.284 --> 1:04:32.615
Attaboy!

1:04:45.673 --> 1:04:48.039
I've waited
a long time for this.

1:04:48.134 --> 1:04:50.466
You cannot take our dragons!

1:04:50.553 --> 1:04:52.214
They are controlled
by the Alpha!

1:04:52.305 --> 1:04:55.138
Then it's a good thing
I brought a challenger.

1:05:18.289 --> 1:05:19.495
Another one?

1:05:19.582 --> 1:05:22.870
That is a class ten! Class ten!

1:05:22.961 --> 1:05:24.167
Look out!

1:05:26.798 --> 1:05:29.710
- No... no...
- Come on! Take down the Alpha!

1:05:49.070 --> 1:05:50.310
Thank you.

1:05:50.405 --> 1:05:51.736
For you, my dear...

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:53.688
Anything.

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:03.122
Val, do you think
you can stop them?

1:06:03.209 --> 1:06:05.700
I'll do my best.
Come on, cloudjumper!

1:06:05.795 --> 1:06:07.660
You!

1:06:07.755 --> 1:06:09.871
I watched you burn!

1:06:09.966 --> 1:06:12.298
It takes more than
a little fire to kill me!

1:06:35.033 --> 1:06:36.273
Stoick!

1:06:56.846 --> 1:06:58.006
No!

1:07:00.141 --> 1:07:01.972
No!

1:07:22.997 --> 1:07:24.453
We've won.

1:07:25.959 --> 1:07:27.540
Finish her!

1:07:27.627 --> 1:07:28.867
No!

1:07:37.011 --> 1:07:38.217
Hold on!

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:39.544
Skullcrusher, go!

1:07:40.598 --> 1:07:41.758
Come on, gobber!

1:07:41.849 --> 1:07:44.056
Right behind you, stoick!

1:08:03.288 --> 1:08:04.494
Stop!

1:08:06.666 --> 1:08:07.906
Stop!

1:08:13.798 --> 1:08:17.757
This...
Is the great dragon master?

1:08:17.844 --> 1:08:20.176
The son of stoick the vast?

1:08:22.849 --> 1:08:25.556
What shame he must feel.

1:08:26.519 --> 1:08:28.225
All of this loss...

1:08:28.313 --> 1:08:29.894
And for what?

1:08:29.981 --> 1:08:31.892
To become unstoppable?

1:08:31.983 --> 1:08:34.144
To rule the world?

1:08:34.235 --> 1:08:38.194
Dragons, they-they are kind,
amazing creatures

1:08:38.281 --> 1:08:39.896
that can bring people together.

1:08:41.868 --> 1:08:43.779
Or tear them apart.

1:08:46.664 --> 1:08:49.155
You see, I know what it is

1:08:49.250 --> 1:08:51.832
to live in fear,

1:08:51.919 --> 1:08:54.581
to see my village burned,

1:08:54.672 --> 1:08:57.630
my family taken.

1:08:57.717 --> 1:08:59.799
But even as a boy...

1:09:00.428 --> 1:09:02.544
Left with nothing,

1:09:03.348 --> 1:09:07.307
I vowed to rise above
the fear of dragons...

1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:12.011
And liberate the people
of this world.

1:09:12.106 --> 1:09:14.438
Then why a dragon army?

1:09:14.525 --> 1:09:18.985
Well, you need dragons
to conquer other dragons.

1:09:19.072 --> 1:09:22.155
Or maybe you need dragons
to conquer people...

1:09:22.825 --> 1:09:25.032
To control those
who follow you...

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:28.281
And to get rid
of those who won't.

1:09:30.958 --> 1:09:32.539
Clever boy.

1:09:32.627 --> 1:09:34.993
The world wants peace,

1:09:35.088 --> 1:09:38.171
and we have the answer
back on berk.

1:09:38.257 --> 1:09:40.293
Just... let me show you...

1:09:40.385 --> 1:09:41.670
No!

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.127
Let me...

1:09:44.222 --> 1:09:46.178
Show you!

1:09:53.981 --> 1:09:54.981
What in...

1:10:00.488 --> 1:10:01.898
Hiccup!

1:10:01.989 --> 1:10:04.275
Come on, gobber!

1:10:04.367 --> 1:10:06.904
Okay, change of plan.

1:10:09.038 --> 1:10:12.576
No dragon can resist
the Alpha's command.

1:10:12.667 --> 1:10:16.660
So he who controls the Alpha...

1:10:16.754 --> 1:10:19.996
Controls them all.

1:10:22.468 --> 1:10:24.880
Toothless?

1:10:30.184 --> 1:10:32.550
T-toothless, you okay, bud?
What's going on?

1:10:32.645 --> 1:10:34.385
Witness true strength.

1:10:36.607 --> 1:10:39.690
The strength
of will over others.

1:10:44.532 --> 1:10:46.773
In the face of it,

1:10:46.868 --> 1:10:49.575
you are nothing.

1:10:53.791 --> 1:10:56.373
Uh... what did he just tell you?

1:11:00.214 --> 1:11:01.795
Toothless, come on.

1:11:01.883 --> 1:11:03.498
What's the matter with you?

1:11:03.593 --> 1:11:05.313
No, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing?

1:11:05.344 --> 1:11:06.709
Knock it off.

1:11:06.804 --> 1:11:09.170
Stop! Snap out of it!

1:11:15.730 --> 1:11:17.436
Toothless, no!

1:11:17.523 --> 1:11:19.434
Toothless!

1:11:23.362 --> 1:11:24.852
- Don't!
- Hiccup!

1:11:26.324 --> 1:11:28.360
- Stop...!
- Son!

1:11:28.451 --> 1:11:29.451
Dad!

1:11:29.535 --> 1:11:30.775
No!

1:11:37.460 --> 1:11:38.540
Hmm.

1:11:49.847 --> 1:11:50.962
No...

1:11:59.106 --> 1:12:00.562
Dad!

1:12:00.650 --> 1:12:02.561
Stoick...

1:12:05.905 --> 1:12:07.361
Dad?

1:12:07.448 --> 1:12:09.234
No. You...

1:12:22.129 --> 1:12:23.369
No.

1:12:32.807 --> 1:12:34.843
No, no, no. No.

1:12:56.539 --> 1:12:58.245
No! Get away from him!

1:13:00.167 --> 1:13:01.623
Go on! Get out of here!

1:13:01.711 --> 1:13:04.373
Get away!

1:13:04.463 --> 1:13:07.421
It's not his fault.

1:13:07.508 --> 1:13:09.089
You know that.

1:13:15.850 --> 1:13:17.135
Good dragons

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:19.592
under the control
of bad people...

1:13:19.687 --> 1:13:22.053
- No, wait. Don't go.
- Do bad things.

1:13:42.001 --> 1:13:43.241
Come on!

1:13:44.670 --> 1:13:47.002
Gather the men
and meet me at berk!

1:13:47.089 --> 1:13:49.751
- Toothless!
- No, don't.

1:14:15.868 --> 1:14:18.450
May the valkyries welcome you

1:14:18.537 --> 1:14:21.495
and lead you through
Odin's great battlefield.

1:14:22.541 --> 1:14:25.374
May they sing your name
with love and fury,

1:14:25.461 --> 1:14:28.794
so that we might hear it rise
from the depths of Valhalla,

1:14:29.340 --> 1:14:31.626
and know that you've taken
your rightful place

1:14:31.717 --> 1:14:34.049
at the table of kings.

1:14:35.596 --> 1:14:38.008
For a great man has fallen.

1:14:38.849 --> 1:14:40.134
A warrior.

1:14:41.102 --> 1:14:42.592
A chieftain.

1:14:42.687 --> 1:14:44.518
A father.

1:14:45.606 --> 1:14:46.812
A friend.

1:15:21.392 --> 1:15:23.132
I'm sorry, dad.

1:15:36.407 --> 1:15:38.068
I'm not the chief that...

1:15:38.159 --> 1:15:39.615
You wanted me to be.

1:15:40.327 --> 1:15:43.740
And I'm not the peacekeeper
I thought I was.

1:15:45.958 --> 1:15:48.324
L... don't know...

1:16:01.307 --> 1:16:04.219
You came early into this world.

1:16:04.310 --> 1:16:06.676
You were such a wee thing.

1:16:06.771 --> 1:16:10.389
On, so frail, so fragile.

1:16:10.483 --> 1:16:12.565
I feared you wouldn't make it.

1:16:14.695 --> 1:16:16.560
But your father...

1:16:17.656 --> 1:16:19.237
He never doubted.

1:16:20.159 --> 1:16:24.402
He always said you'd become
the strongest of them all.

1:16:24.497 --> 1:16:26.533
And he was right.

1:16:28.584 --> 1:16:30.996
You have the heart of a chief,

1:16:31.087 --> 1:16:33.328
and the soul of a dragon.

1:16:33.422 --> 1:16:36.914
Only you can bring
our worlds together.

1:16:38.052 --> 1:16:42.045
That... is who you are, son.

1:16:55.569 --> 1:16:56.934
I, uh...

1:16:58.030 --> 1:17:01.113
I was so afraid
of becoming my dad.

1:17:03.285 --> 1:17:06.027
Mostly because
I thought I never could.

1:17:06.122 --> 1:17:09.114
How-how do you become someone...

1:17:09.208 --> 1:17:11.620
That great, that... brave,

1:17:11.710 --> 1:17:14.247
that... selfless?

1:17:17.466 --> 1:17:20.333
I guess you can only try.

1:17:27.685 --> 1:17:30.722
A chief protects his own.

1:17:34.066 --> 1:17:35.806
We're going back.

1:17:37.027 --> 1:17:40.895
- Uh... with what?
- Uh, he took all the dragons.

1:17:40.990 --> 1:17:43.402
Not all of them.

1:17:47.163 --> 1:17:48.494
Whoal

1:17:48.581 --> 1:17:50.287
whoal! “Whoa!

1:17:50.374 --> 1:17:51.705
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:17:54.170 --> 1:17:55.455
I don't want to die!

1:17:55.546 --> 1:17:57.537
We can't fly these things!

1:17:57.631 --> 1:17:58.751
Yeah, no kidding!

1:17:58.841 --> 1:18:00.752
Whoa...!

1:18:02.428 --> 1:18:04.009
But won't that bewilderbeast

1:18:04.096 --> 1:18:06.712
just take control
of these guys, too?

1:18:06.807 --> 1:18:09.640
They're babies!
They don't listen to anyone.

1:18:09.727 --> 1:18:11.809
Yeah. Just like us.

1:18:11.896 --> 1:18:14.478
This is... whoal...
Very dangerous!

1:18:18.986 --> 1:18:22.979
Some might suggest
this is poorly conceived!

1:18:23.073 --> 1:18:25.029
Well, it's a good thing
that I never listen.

1:18:25.117 --> 1:18:26.527
Whoal

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:27.825
so...

1:18:27.912 --> 1:18:30.324
What is your... plan?

1:18:30.414 --> 1:18:33.247
Get toothless back
and kick drago's...

1:18:33.334 --> 1:18:34.824
Heads up!

1:18:34.919 --> 1:18:36.910
And that thing.

1:18:37.004 --> 1:18:38.835
Whoa... owl!

1:18:59.526 --> 1:19:00.526
Oh! On...

1:19:00.611 --> 1:19:02.476
Ah, that's a good boy.

1:19:06.784 --> 1:19:08.240
Uh...

1:19:08.327 --> 1:19:10.158
W-w-watch the furniture!

1:19:10.246 --> 1:19:12.237
Where are you going?

1:19:29.682 --> 1:19:32.640
Your chief... is dead!

1:19:32.726 --> 1:19:35.263
- Stoick?
- Not possible!

1:19:35.354 --> 1:19:37.811
No one can protect you now!

1:19:52.079 --> 1:19:53.910
No.

1:19:54.623 --> 1:19:56.534
He took all the dragons.

1:19:58.294 --> 1:19:59.830
Distract the Alpha.

1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:02.502
Try to keep his focus
off of toothless.

1:20:02.589 --> 1:20:03.795
Uh, how?

1:20:03.882 --> 1:20:05.918
Have you forgotten
who you're riding with?

1:20:06.010 --> 1:20:09.468
There isn't a dragon alive
that I can't wrangle! Aah!

1:20:09.555 --> 1:20:11.755
- Except for this one...!
- Amateur.

1:20:13.434 --> 1:20:14.844
Hey, look! It's hiccup!

1:20:20.691 --> 1:20:22.477
What?

1:20:36.957 --> 1:20:38.618
Keep 'em coming!

1:20:38.709 --> 1:20:40.245
Black sheep, baby!

1:20:50.763 --> 1:20:52.503
Ten points!

1:20:54.266 --> 1:20:55.881
Uh-oh.

1:21:06.695 --> 1:21:08.651
I'm okay!

1:21:16.163 --> 1:21:19.530
You certainly are hard
to get rid of, I'll say that.

1:21:19.625 --> 1:21:21.536
Toothless...

1:21:21.627 --> 1:21:23.538
Hey.

1:21:23.629 --> 1:21:25.711
It's me, bud.

1:21:25.798 --> 1:21:27.038
It's me.

1:21:27.132 --> 1:21:29.168
It's me. I'm right here, bud.

1:21:29.259 --> 1:21:30.965
Come back to me.

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:35.720
He's not yours anymore.

1:21:35.808 --> 1:21:37.969
He belongs to the Alpha.

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:41.552
But, please,
o great dragon master,

1:21:41.647 --> 1:21:44.184
try... to take him.

1:21:44.274 --> 1:21:47.687
He will not miss a second time.

1:21:47.778 --> 1:21:49.860
It wasn't your fault, bud.

1:21:51.448 --> 1:21:53.780
They... made you do it.

1:22:03.210 --> 1:22:05.041
You'd never hurt him.

1:22:09.216 --> 1:22:12.458
You'd never hurt me.

1:22:15.764 --> 1:22:17.675
How are you doing that?

1:22:17.766 --> 1:22:21.054
Please.
You are my best friend, bud.

1:22:25.315 --> 1:22:27.101
My best friend.

1:22:32.781 --> 1:22:34.396
Attaboy! That's it!

1:22:34.491 --> 1:22:35.491
I'm here.

1:22:35.576 --> 1:22:37.066
Enough!

1:22:41.874 --> 1:22:42.874
Yeah!

1:22:42.958 --> 1:22:45.040
Hang on!

1:22:49.756 --> 1:22:51.417
Almost there, buddy,
almost there.

1:23:01.477 --> 1:23:02.967
Do something!

1:23:03.061 --> 1:23:05.017
We need to get those two apart.

1:23:15.324 --> 1:23:17.815
We gotta block him out,
toothless.

1:23:17.910 --> 1:23:19.616
Do you trust me, bud?

1:23:21.830 --> 1:23:23.491
We can do this.

1:23:23.582 --> 1:23:26.198
You... and me...

1:23:26.293 --> 1:23:27.874
As one.

1:23:30.506 --> 1:23:31.746
That's it.

1:23:31.840 --> 1:23:34.206
Now let's try this
one more time!

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:38.047
Take him down, babe!

1:23:41.767 --> 1:23:42.847
Go get him.

1:23:45.145 --> 1:23:46.555
Take control of it!

1:23:49.233 --> 1:23:50.473
Shut it out, toothless.

1:23:50.567 --> 1:23:52.103
- Stop them!
- Now!

1:23:57.824 --> 1:23:58.824
Huh...?

1:24:15.509 --> 1:24:16.544
Not again.

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:21.845
Toothless, it's now or never!

1:24:23.767 --> 1:24:25.052
Come on, bud!

1:24:27.396 --> 1:24:28.396
Hold on!

1:24:31.608 --> 1:24:33.894
Ya-ha! We did it!

1:24:42.077 --> 1:24:44.614
Hold him there, toothless.

1:24:44.705 --> 1:24:46.787
It's all over now.

1:24:48.500 --> 1:24:49.990
Oris it?

1:24:51.003 --> 1:24:52.743
Uh...

1:24:52.838 --> 1:24:53.838
Oh, no!

1:25:03.056 --> 1:25:04.592
No!

1:25:04.683 --> 1:25:07.595
No!

1:25:15.485 --> 1:25:16.520
Hiccup...

1:25:47.726 --> 1:25:49.136
He's challenging the Alpha!

1:25:49.227 --> 1:25:50.842
To protect you!

1:26:16.672 --> 1:26:19.664
No, no, no, no, no! No!

1:26:19.758 --> 1:26:21.669
Fight back! Fight!

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:22.920
Fight!

1:26:25.514 --> 1:26:27.800
What's the matter with you!

1:26:31.144 --> 1:26:34.352
Hold your ground!
Hold the line now!

1:26:38.026 --> 1:26:39.186
Now do you get it?

1:26:39.277 --> 1:26:42.769
This is what it is
to earn a dragon's loyalty.

1:26:44.866 --> 1:26:46.572
Let this end now.

1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:47.900
Never!

1:26:47.994 --> 1:26:49.074
Come on!

1:26:57.796 --> 1:26:58.831
Huh?

1:27:12.310 --> 1:27:13.800
Fight!

1:27:47.387 --> 1:27:49.844
The Alpha... protects them all.

1:28:49.825 --> 1:28:51.861
You never cease
to amaze me, bud.

1:28:52.494 --> 1:28:54.109
Thank you.

1:28:57.290 --> 1:28:59.997
Toothless, you know
that doesn't wash out!

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.662
- I knew you'd come back!
- You're back, my beauty!

1:29:04.756 --> 1:29:05.996
Oh! Onl

1:29:07.259 --> 1:29:08.374
stormfly!

1:29:11.429 --> 1:29:14.091
Oh, give me a cuddle, grumpy!

1:29:14.182 --> 1:29:15.592
Oh!

1:29:17.602 --> 1:29:19.138
Who's my little Princess!

1:29:19.229 --> 1:29:20.810
Don't you ever leave
again, hookfang.

1:29:20.897 --> 1:29:23.730
Oh, you are. Yes, you are.
I missed you...

1:29:23.817 --> 1:29:25.023
Oh, barf...

1:29:25.110 --> 1:29:26.771
Not you!

1:29:29.281 --> 1:29:30.396
That was some

1:29:30.490 --> 1:29:32.572
pretty fine dragon-wrangling
back there.

1:29:32.659 --> 1:29:34.274
You'd make a good trapper.

1:29:34.369 --> 1:29:35.825
Whoa.

1:29:35.912 --> 1:29:38.870
You know... skullcrusher
is gonna need somebody

1:29:38.957 --> 1:29:40.197
to look after him now.

1:29:40.834 --> 1:29:41.949
Me?

1:29:46.214 --> 1:29:47.420
I'd be honored.

1:29:48.508 --> 1:29:50.544
Oh, your father,

1:29:50.635 --> 1:29:53.001
he'd be every bit
as proud as I am.

1:29:53.096 --> 1:29:54.836
Thank you.

1:29:54.931 --> 1:29:56.967
I'm really glad
you're here, mom.

1:29:57.058 --> 1:29:59.049
And here ['ll stay.

1:30:00.562 --> 1:30:02.473
See?

1:30:02.564 --> 1:30:04.054
I told you it was in here.

1:30:04.149 --> 1:30:06.060
Ah, ha, ha.

1:30:06.151 --> 1:30:07.732
You're still doing that one.

1:30:07.819 --> 1:30:09.434
That's hilarious.

1:30:09.529 --> 1:30:12.066
- Come here, you.
- Mm!

1:30:12.157 --> 1:30:13.442
Ooh!

1:30:43.688 --> 1:30:45.849
The chief has come home!

1:30:49.611 --> 1:30:50.942
Yeah!

1:30:52.530 --> 1:30:54.646
Long live the chief!

1:30:54.741 --> 1:30:59.030
Long live the chief!
Long live the chief!

1:30:59.120 --> 1:31:01.202
Long live the chief!

1:31:11.800 --> 1:31:13.336
Yeah! Ha-hal

1:31:15.303 --> 1:31:16.509
ah...

1:31:17.889 --> 1:31:19.845
Yah-ha-ha-hal

1:31:23.812 --> 1:31:25.894
this... is berk.

1:31:26.856 --> 1:31:28.392
A bit trampled and busted

1:31:28.483 --> 1:31:31.145
and covered in ice,
but it's home.

1:31:31.236 --> 1:31:32.646
It's our home.

1:31:36.992 --> 1:31:40.405
Those who attacked us
are relentless and crazy.

1:31:40.495 --> 1:31:42.611
But those who stopped them?

1:31:42.706 --> 1:31:45.322
Oh... even more so!

1:31:47.585 --> 1:31:51.169
We may be small in numbers,
but we stand for something

1:31:51.256 --> 1:31:54.293
bigger than anything
the world can pit against us.

1:31:55.510 --> 1:31:57.967
We are the voice of peace.

1:31:58.054 --> 1:32:01.137
And bit by bit,
we will change this world.

1:32:06.396 --> 1:32:07.556
Wow!

1:32:10.316 --> 1:32:12.773
You see,
we have something they don't.

1:32:12.861 --> 1:32:14.397
Oh, sure, they have armies,

1:32:15.071 --> 1:32:17.938
and they have armadas, but we...

1:32:18.033 --> 1:32:19.398
We have...

1:32:21.619 --> 1:32:22.984
Our dragons!
