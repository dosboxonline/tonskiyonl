WEBVTT

03:08.980 --> 03:11.691
- Only one.
- That's enough, stand back.

03:18.657 --> 03:20.158
knight:
Behold!

03:20.784 --> 03:23.828
The traitor
dragon Meleys!

03:23.954 --> 03:28.124
- Slain at Rook's Rest

03:28.124 --> 03:29.834
by your king!

03:32.003 --> 03:33.463
To Aegon!

03:41.972 --> 03:45.183
- It can't be...
- They killed a dragon!

03:45.308 --> 03:48.311
townsperson 1:
Mark my words,
this is a black omen.

04:06.037 --> 04:08.707
townsperson 2:
Rhaenyra will answer this.

04:09.541 --> 04:11.209
'Tis an abomination.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.754
Don't they realize
we won the battle?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.841
Strange victory...

04:18.550 --> 04:20.218
if it was one.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.863
- knight: Behold!

04:40.906 --> 04:43.700
The traitor dragon Meleys!

04:43.700 --> 04:45.535
I thought
the dragons was gods.

04:45.535 --> 04:49.080
knight:
Slain at Rook's Rest
by your king!

04:57.422 --> 04:59.090
It's just meat.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.773
Is he alive?

07:19.898 --> 07:21.900
His Grace...

07:22.025 --> 07:24.945
remains with us,
for the moment.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.919
Is my son
going to die?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.754
I'm afraid
I cannot say.

08:25.005 --> 08:28.425
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Your Grace, these next hours
are most critical.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.634
Of course.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.316
Grand Maester Orwyle:
Easy as you can.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.297
Someone will have
to rule in his stead.

09:30.487 --> 09:33.156
- What happened?
- We took the castle.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.909
At the cost
of some 900 men.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.329
So I've heard.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.583
I left a meager garrison
behind to protect it

09:43.708 --> 09:46.211
and the king's dragon.

09:46.336 --> 09:48.380
Sunfyrewas long
in the dying.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.216
The king, Ser Criston,
what befell him?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.430
His Grace
fought valiantly.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.771
And Aemond?

10:11.903 --> 10:14.072
What was
his part in this?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.911
I could not say.

10:23.373 --> 10:27.085
Alfred Broome:
Our largest dragon
has been killed.

10:27.210 --> 10:31.590
Criston Cole marches
about the Crownlands
unchallenged.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.218
Duskendale
and Rook's Rest
are gone.

10:36.261 --> 10:37.888
We still have
no ground army

10:37.888 --> 10:40.891
but the one we hope
that Daemon will raise.

10:40.891 --> 10:45.061
He who has left us...
after some marital spat.

10:46.938 --> 10:49.274
Do you take issue
with me, Ser Alfred?

10:51.818 --> 10:53.987
My loyalty to you
is proven, my queen.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.239
Your loyalty, perhaps,

10:56.239 --> 10:59.075
but your willingness
to give me deference
in a time of war.

10:59.075 --> 11:02.245
I could never doubt
your capability,

11:02.245 --> 11:05.165
or your quickness
of mind.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.251
It is merely that
the gentler sex,

11:08.251 --> 11:10.670
heretofore,
has not been much privy

11:10.795 --> 11:13.632
to the strategies
of battle,

11:13.632 --> 11:15.592
or their execution.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.929
There has been peace
in our lifetime.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.473
You've seen no more
battles than I have.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.828
Send to Maidenpool
and to Crackclaw Point.

11:43.828 --> 11:44.996
Let them man
their garrisons

11:44.996 --> 11:46.623
and give them
stores or weapons

11:46.623 --> 11:48.166
if they find
them wanting.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.669
If Cole pursues
his campaign,

11:50.669 --> 11:53.964
- our allies must be ready.
- We must answer Rook's Rest,

11:53.964 --> 11:56.299
- and Duskendale.
- Bartimos Celtigar:
They are lost already.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.843
But Vhagar
is depleted after such

11:58.843 --> 12:00.011
a hard-fought battle.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.304
Lorent Marbrand:
If Aegon is dead--

12:01.304 --> 12:02.681
Steffon Darklyn:
We will soon know it.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.641
Gormon Massey:
'Twould be a victory
in name only.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.810
They will soon
prop up another
in his stead.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.019
The time is ripe.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.354
If we can strike
King's Landing

12:09.479 --> 12:10.981
before their dragon
is recovered--

12:10.981 --> 12:12.524
Then I myself must do it.

12:12.649 --> 12:16.194
My queen, you are the crown.
It is out of the question.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.822
What would you
have me do?

12:39.342 --> 12:41.428
Baela Targaryen:
Jace?

12:43.722 --> 12:45.348
Where are
you going?

12:46.558 --> 12:50.854
To Harrenhal.
To treat with Daemon.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.230
Rhaenys is fallen.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.107
He must affirm
his loyalty to my mother

12:54.232 --> 12:56.234
and report his standing.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.239
And you think you
will tame him...

13:01.364 --> 13:02.949
when the queen
herself could not?

13:03.074 --> 13:05.869
My mother gladly
sends you away

13:05.869 --> 13:07.704
to scout, to fight,

13:07.704 --> 13:10.790
whilst I'm here
being forced to play
the coddled princeling.

13:10.916 --> 13:15.128
- It's humiliating, Baela.
- She only protects you.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.588
You are the succession.

13:16.713 --> 13:20.759
Then I must be seen
to act for her claim
and mine.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.140
I can sit still
no longer.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.269
I must act.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.278
The Freys.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.616
They control
the crossing
at the Twins.

13:44.616 --> 13:47.452
Cregan Stark's
graybeards are
marching south.

13:47.452 --> 13:50.789
If his men
had a direct route
into the Riverlands,

13:50.789 --> 13:52.916
we would not have to wait
for Daemon to act.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.294
I will treat
with The Freys
to secure it.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.129
She will not like it.

13:58.630 --> 14:02.509
Then don't tell her.
Not until I'm away.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.817
Daemon Targaryen:
The hour is late
and my dragon is hungry.

14:18.942 --> 14:22.279
- You have no choice
but to submit.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.155
Our terms are simple,
Lord Bracken.

14:24.155 --> 14:27.867
Renounce the false king
Aegon as a usurper

14:27.993 --> 14:30.662
and bend the knee to me

14:30.787 --> 14:32.455
or your house burns.

14:32.455 --> 14:35.500
I would sooner be
the Lord of Bones
and Cinders

14:35.625 --> 14:39.963
than bend my knee
before some heathen
Blackwood cunt...

14:39.963 --> 14:41.548
and his hired dragon.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.174
The Brackens were
a people hatched out

14:43.300 --> 14:45.635
of the deepest
of the Seven Hells,
Your Grace.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.178
It would be a kindness
to oblige them

14:47.178 --> 14:49.180
and send them back
whence they came.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.473
Did your brother's head

14:50.473 --> 14:53.018
keep on its way
back to you, Willem?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.228
I heard the maggots
got to it.

14:55.353 --> 14:58.356
That is quite
the impression,
Lord Bracken.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.401
But alas,
not an answer.

15:11.077 --> 15:13.413
We choose fire.

15:23.256 --> 15:26.676
I did not think
they would be
so eager to die.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.262
They made
their choice.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.557
- You should've indulged them.
- I need them alive.

15:32.557 --> 15:35.518
I came here
to raise swords,
not corpses.

15:36.061 --> 15:39.231
But now you see what
my house has known
for generations.

15:39.231 --> 15:41.233
They are pigheaded,
intransigent--

15:41.358 --> 15:43.902
They would rather
burn than succumb.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.741
Exactly the kind
of men I need.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.245
It may yet
be possible, I think,

15:53.245 --> 15:55.288
for both of us
to achieve our ends.

15:55.413 --> 15:58.083
We have fought them
for an age and more.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.542
Then perhaps
you could try

15:59.542 --> 16:01.920
less fighting
and more...

16:05.715 --> 16:07.467
persuading.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.971
They are
unyielding in battle.

16:17.727 --> 16:20.564
But every man
has a weakness.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.066
You take
my meaning, then.

16:26.611 --> 16:30.782
There are things
the crown itself must
not been seen to do.

16:32.117 --> 16:33.618
Show them
your worst.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.079
I am your servant,
Your Grace.

16:57.142 --> 17:00.812
Jeyne Arryn:
<i>Over the centuries,
many and more armies</i>

17:00.812 --> 17:04.107
have broken themselves
against my bloody gate.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.488
Are you listening?

17:11.281 --> 17:12.657
My lady.

17:13.158 --> 17:15.827
The Eyrie itself
is impregnable.

17:17.996 --> 17:21.333
Unless, of course,
we're descended upon
from the sky.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.127
You promised
the Queen Rhaenyra
15,000 swords--

17:24.127 --> 17:27.380
In return for protection.
A dragon.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.718
Then she
has exceeded
your terms.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.011
She sent two.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.056
Both still wet
from the egg.

17:37.682 --> 17:40.227
I have hunting hounds
that are more fearsome.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.687
They are dragons
nonetheless.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.481
I do not recall
you specifying

17:44.481 --> 17:46.191
the size of the beast
in your request.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.193
Will you goad me, child?

17:48.693 --> 17:51.696
When your bread and shelter
now depend on my pleasure?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.408
The dragons will grow...

17:56.368 --> 17:58.578
- in time.
- I don't have time.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.707
I mislike
feeling powerless.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.543
So do I.

18:12.050 --> 18:13.843
This will be
your chamber.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.054
I'll expect you
at supper this evening?

18:19.015 --> 18:23.228
My sympathies for the death
of your grandmother.

18:31.403 --> 18:34.197
The way they spoke
at my small council today.

18:34.197 --> 18:37.701
Do they hold you responsible
for Rhaenys and her dragon?

18:37.701 --> 18:39.411
I would rather
they had.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.622
They speak around me,
not to me.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.416
They would make
me queen,

18:44.541 --> 18:46.710
but they wish
to keep me here, confined.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.254
They betray their
own smallness.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.089
In truth,
I cannot fault them.

18:51.214 --> 18:55.385
I am now the sovereign.
I cannot do as I please.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.096
And war has ever been
for men to make.

18:58.096 --> 19:01.600
You are your father's
chosen successor.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.060
He did not prepare
me to fight.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.937
If I had been a son,

19:06.062 --> 19:09.608
a sword thrust into my hand
the moment I could walk.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.402
Instead, I was given
my father's cup...

19:12.944 --> 19:15.488
taught the name
of every lord and castle

19:15.614 --> 19:17.073
between Storm's End
and the Twins,

19:17.073 --> 19:20.285
but not the difference
between hilt and foible.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.954
And they know it.

19:24.289 --> 19:27.918
- And Daemon as well--
- Shall your evening meal
be served here, Your Grace?

19:27.918 --> 19:29.628
Not now.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.177
Will you send to him?

19:38.595 --> 19:41.431
For too long,
I have looked to him
for strength.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.516
If I must be supplicant
to my own husband,

19:43.642 --> 19:45.477
what does
that make me?

19:48.813 --> 19:52.025
I do not know
my part, Mysaria.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.822
The path I walk
has never been trod.

19:58.823 --> 20:02.619
Criston Cole
made a mistake.

20:03.995 --> 20:08.291
Parading a dragon's head
through the streets
like a prize of war,

20:08.291 --> 20:10.335
but the people
see an ill omen.

20:10.335 --> 20:11.836
Yes, as do I.

20:11.836 --> 20:15.173
They are afraid,
bread is scarce,

20:15.173 --> 20:16.633
the king has fallen,

20:16.633 --> 20:19.219
they whisper to each other
that when Viserys lived,

20:19.344 --> 20:21.471
- there was peace.

20:21.471 --> 20:24.224
But will whispers
tear down stone...

20:24.349 --> 20:25.725
or break shields?

20:25.850 --> 20:29.229
Do not underestimate
your subjects.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.855
They are
a thousand-thousand

20:30.981 --> 20:32.649
living in the shadow
of the Red Keep

20:32.649 --> 20:35.193
and forgotten
for too long.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.071
And you think they
will turn to me.

20:38.196 --> 20:42.701
To the discontented,
rumors are feed.

20:47.205 --> 20:48.999
Your Grace.

20:51.084 --> 20:55.714
What you cannot do,
let others do for you.

20:56.840 --> 21:00.176
There is more
than one way
to fight a war.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.868
The thought of her
lying in a field,

21:24.868 --> 21:27.746
broken amongst
her enemies.

21:38.089 --> 21:42.302
Did your grandmother
ever tell you of the night
she claimed Meleys?

21:43.303 --> 21:45.305
She snuck into
the Dragonpit.

21:45.931 --> 21:48.433
She knew that place
better than any Elder.

21:48.934 --> 21:51.102
They say she could
see in the dark.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.439
My father was furious.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.566
His own mother's dragon,

21:56.566 --> 21:57.943
the fastest beast
ever known,

21:58.068 --> 21:59.903
- and she'd have none of him.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.405
But bent her neck
to Rhaenys.

22:03.448 --> 22:05.617
She was fierce...

22:06.743 --> 22:08.954
in love and in anger.

22:11.456 --> 22:15.168
She did not always
care for me, but...

22:16.795 --> 22:21.007
for what she gave
me in the end,
I'm grateful.

22:26.805 --> 22:29.933
I wished I had known her
when she was young.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.818
-  You are
very like her in some ways.

22:42.320 --> 22:47.284
And with her gone...
I must rely on you,
I think.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.953
Your Grace?

22:49.953 --> 22:52.706
Would you give this
to your grandsire?

23:04.134 --> 23:06.845
I do not wish to stand alone.

23:10.515 --> 23:12.309
female voice:
Daemon.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.398
<i>Daemon.</i>

23:19.149 --> 23:22.027
<i>You were always
the strong one.</i>

23:23.862 --> 23:26.698
The finest swordsman...

23:29.367 --> 23:32.037
the fearless dragonrider.

23:33.830 --> 23:37.584
<i>Your brother had great
love in his heart...</i>

23:41.755 --> 23:44.216
<i>...but he lacked
your constitution.</i>

23:45.050 --> 23:47.844
<i>Viserys was unsuited
for the crown...</i>

23:50.889 --> 23:54.935
<i>but you... Daemon,
you were made to wear it.</i>

24:15.080 --> 24:18.250
<i>If only you'd
been born first.</i>

24:19.459 --> 24:21.920
My favorite son.

24:28.093 --> 24:31.471
Is the duck
not to your liking,
Your Grace?

24:36.434 --> 24:40.063
There's also goose,
if you'd prefer it.

24:41.731 --> 24:43.608
I like the goose, myself.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.285
Uh, I'm not hungry.

24:53.410 --> 24:55.620
Simon Strong:
I was saying, given
the rather dire news

24:55.745 --> 24:57.581
from Rook's Rest...

24:58.415 --> 25:02.419
it appears the winds
have shifted and each side
has suffered great loss,

25:02.419 --> 25:06.006
and will be unsure
of what is to follow.

25:07.132 --> 25:10.093
A good time, then,
for a show of strength.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.261
I believe
Willem Blackwood

25:11.261 --> 25:13.930
is bringing
House Bracken to heel.

25:15.140 --> 25:18.518
We must ready the castle
to receive a great host.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.647
You seem sure of this.

25:22.647 --> 25:25.442
All men may be led,
Ser Simon.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.193
Even Rivermen.

25:28.153 --> 25:32.157
'Tis a matter of showing them
whom it behooves them to follow.

25:33.325 --> 25:35.660
How does the work
here progress?

25:35.994 --> 25:39.789
Oh, um...
we're drawing water
for the kitchens

25:39.789 --> 25:42.167
- and lighting the forges.
- Very well.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.794
That is merely
the beginning,
of course.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.546
The roof alone
has needed tending

25:46.671 --> 25:47.631
since the reign
of Aenys.

25:47.631 --> 25:48.840
And the storerooms.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.884
And...

25:51.009 --> 25:53.511
and the Wailing Tower.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.514
The bats have
made the corridors
almost impassable

25:56.640 --> 25:58.642
with the quantity
of their...

25:59.684 --> 26:01.228
Their shit.

26:03.355 --> 26:05.232
I venture there are
smiths and armorers

26:05.357 --> 26:07.817
to be found
near Nutton
and Riverbend.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.861
Well, send for them,
and levy the farmers

26:09.986 --> 26:11.988
from Antlers
to High Heart.

26:12.197 --> 26:16.034
Task their huntsmen
to bring us meat and wood.

26:16.159 --> 26:18.828
Um, there is, of course,
the matter of payment.

26:20.497 --> 26:25.043
After the,
the tragedy that
befell his father...

26:25.377 --> 26:31.174
Larys transferred
his family's wealth
to King's Landing.

26:31.174 --> 26:33.593
Is there any gold
left in your coffers?

26:33.718 --> 26:38.390
Enough to keep this
small establishment
you see fed and warm.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.892
Relatively.

26:43.270 --> 26:46.731
I... I rather thought,
Your Grace, as

26:46.731 --> 26:50.068
emissary to the Queen

26:50.193 --> 26:54.030
that p-perhaps
she could provide
the necessary coin

26:54.030 --> 26:57.617
- if you could
only write to her.
- No.

26:57.742 --> 26:59.744
Harrenhal is
my command.

27:00.203 --> 27:03.081
I shall guarantee
the payment myself.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.709
Up, up.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.755
Very well,
Your Grace.

27:11.089 --> 27:14.259
You should
address me as "my king."

27:14.593 --> 27:16.261
But you're the prince.

27:16.595 --> 27:18.930
What would you call
the husband of the queen?

27:19.055 --> 27:20.724
- Well, the king...
-There it is, then.

27:20.724 --> 27:22.267
...consort.

27:23.268 --> 27:26.229
That last bit
seems unnecessary,
don't you think?

27:31.943 --> 27:33.904
The armor was Valyrian steel,

27:33.904 --> 27:38.283
but His Grace suffered
grievous burns over
much of his body.

27:39.242 --> 27:41.119
He has many
broken bones.

27:41.244 --> 27:44.623
I fear there are
more injuries within,

27:44.623 --> 27:46.625
injuries we cannot see.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.462
We are grateful
for your works,

27:50.587 --> 27:51.588
Grand Maester.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.258
- Has he woken?
- No.

27:56.509 --> 28:01.181
I must admit,
I'm not sure he
will ever wake.

28:01.306 --> 28:04.517
I have plied my crafts
to their fullest extents.

28:04.643 --> 28:08.813
Our king's fate
lies with the gods now.

28:19.324 --> 28:22.327
A king cannot rule
in his sleep.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.829
The realm will have
noticed his absence.

28:25.330 --> 28:29.042
Let them hear
of his great deeds
at Rook's Rest.

28:29.167 --> 28:31.878
But now we must
name a regent
to take his place

28:32.003 --> 28:33.672
until he recovers...

28:36.007 --> 28:37.342
or does not.

28:38.843 --> 28:41.137
A wise strategy,
Your Grace.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.847
A regency will
assure the people

28:42.973 --> 28:45.517
of the stability
of the crown.

28:48.061 --> 28:51.189
Did you have
a candidate in mind,
Your Grace?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.358
I myself served
in this role
for my husband.

28:53.483 --> 28:55.026
I am well-prepared
to do it again.

28:55.026 --> 28:56.486
You played
your part admirably

28:56.486 --> 28:58.154
in a time of peace,
Your Grace,

28:58.154 --> 29:00.657
but circumstances
have changed.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.367
And here I had
forgotten.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.661
The king does not
lack for heirs.

29:04.661 --> 29:09.708
The obvious choice is
his immediate successor,
Prince Aemond.

29:09.708 --> 29:11.042
Tyland Lannister:
Agreed.

29:11.042 --> 29:13.878
Aemond is young.

29:13.878 --> 29:16.840
And his lack of restraint
has already cost us dearly.

29:26.057 --> 29:30.228
It is experience that offers
the surest path to security.

29:30.353 --> 29:33.356
Queen Alicent ably
shouldered the duties
of the realm

29:33.356 --> 29:35.066
when her husband's
health failed him.

29:35.066 --> 29:36.401
Experience is
valuable, yes,

29:36.401 --> 29:37.861
but the dowager queen
is a woman.

29:37.861 --> 29:41.114
I am no stranger
to rule or to sitting
at this council.

29:41.239 --> 29:42.407
Aemond is
a fearsome dragonrider.

29:42.532 --> 29:43.867
His skill is best
employed in the field,

29:43.867 --> 29:46.870
but my experience
is needed here,
at this table.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.247
No offense was meant,
Your Grace, but...

29:49.247 --> 29:54.419
- at a time when we
must show strength.
- Lord Larys?

29:54.544 --> 29:57.213
I agree, Your Grace.
It must be Prince Aemond.

29:58.924 --> 30:01.384
What would it say if,
in response to Rhaenyra's
crowning,

30:01.384 --> 30:03.803
we raised up
a woman of our own?

30:06.598 --> 30:08.099
But, um...

30:09.476 --> 30:11.394
but the Hand speaks
for the king's voice.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.647
Ser Criston,
what say you?

30:20.445 --> 30:22.822
Aemond is
the next in line.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.493
It must be him.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.250
Aemond Targaryen:
It's agreed then.

30:54.479 --> 30:56.815
What is our standing
in the Riverlands?

30:58.316 --> 31:00.944
Uh, the banners of House Tully

31:00.944 --> 31:03.154
are in disarray,
Your Grace.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.364
Prince Daemon
has little hope

31:04.489 --> 31:06.992
of fielding an army
of any size, for now.

31:08.618 --> 31:10.620
Larys Strong:
We would do well to send
word to young Oscar Tully.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.497
- It's only a matter of time

31:12.622 --> 31:15.000
before he inherits
his grandsire's mantle.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.002
Tell me, Lord Strong,

31:17.127 --> 31:18.545
how I can trust
the counsel of a man

31:18.670 --> 31:20.213
who leaves the jewel
of the Riverlands

31:20.338 --> 31:22.841
to be plucked
by our enemy?

31:26.344 --> 31:27.846
Your brother's host
can meet Daemon.

31:27.971 --> 31:29.180
He should
quicken its pace

31:29.306 --> 31:30.307
and check
the Rivermen

31:30.307 --> 31:31.808
while their banners
are in disarray.

31:31.808 --> 31:34.060
I shall send
Lord Jason encouragement.

31:34.185 --> 31:37.022
-What else?
-We might
turn our attention

31:37.147 --> 31:39.482
to the smallfolk here
in King's Landing.

31:39.482 --> 31:42.027
They have grown weary
of the Sea Snake's blockade.

31:42.152 --> 31:44.195
So have we all.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.405
Many are fleeing the city,

31:45.530 --> 31:48.867
spreading word
of their fear
and unrest.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.162
Mm, then let
the gates be closed.

31:54.331 --> 31:57.000
No one is to leave
or enter, save with
our consent.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.878
Merchants,
so forth.

32:04.049 --> 32:06.009
Go to your tasks.

32:06.718 --> 32:09.221
We shall meet again
at first light.

32:09.221 --> 32:13.350
Oh, and someone
cut down the fucking
ratcatchers.

32:20.232 --> 32:22.567
The city's safe no longer.

32:24.236 --> 32:25.737
There is no food.

32:26.613 --> 32:28.698
Our neighbors
are stealing
from each other.

32:28.698 --> 32:29.950
We must get out.

32:30.075 --> 32:31.868
And where would
you have us go?

32:31.868 --> 32:34.079
North, maybe? South?

32:34.746 --> 32:36.748
For all we know,
every road leads
into the dragons' teeth.

32:36.748 --> 32:39.251
Like the one they carted
through the streets?

32:39.918 --> 32:44.297
You think Rhaenyra
will let such an affront
go unchallenged?

32:47.217 --> 32:49.928
We should make
for Tumbleton.

32:50.053 --> 32:51.972
My brother
will have room.

32:52.097 --> 32:53.932
You would have me
turn beggar?

32:59.938 --> 33:02.732
Are we not
beggars already?

33:02.732 --> 33:04.442
Have you been paid
for those machines

33:04.568 --> 33:05.443
you were forced
to build?

33:05.443 --> 33:07.153
The king has
promised payment.

33:07.279 --> 33:10.282
The king has lied!

33:21.793 --> 33:23.628
By all means...

33:24.296 --> 33:27.841
stay and wait for his
empty promises, husband.

33:29.759 --> 33:32.804
With them, you can feed
the mouths of ghosts.

34:12.135 --> 34:14.137
Presumed you'd be here.

34:14.512 --> 34:17.182
Seeing faithfully
to the Prince Regent's
commands.

34:17.724 --> 34:19.809
Aemond is
the next in line.

34:19.809 --> 34:22.979
- It is the order of things.
- You know what he is...

34:22.979 --> 34:25.023
what he has
somehow become.

34:27.692 --> 34:29.152
Has your loyalty faded?

34:29.152 --> 34:31.154
Or does it flourish
only at night

34:31.154 --> 34:34.032
and flee the sunrise
like a moth?

34:37.661 --> 34:39.204
What I saw
at Rook's Rest--

34:39.204 --> 34:42.666
What?
What did you see?

34:46.544 --> 34:48.713
Their armor melted.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.051
There were men walking.
They were on fire.

34:56.388 --> 34:58.723
We have given the war
to the dragons.

35:00.225 --> 35:01.893
A dragonrider
should lead us.

35:06.231 --> 35:08.441
And what of justice,
of temperance?

35:08.567 --> 35:11.736
Or is strength now
to be our only god?

35:17.075 --> 35:19.077
So you cast me aside.

35:20.245 --> 35:22.247
Have I not spared you?

35:23.915 --> 35:27.877
What we must do
now is... terrible.

35:29.588 --> 35:31.590
Will you preside
over it?

35:32.090 --> 35:36.052
- Is this who you are, Alicent?
- I did not ask to be spared.

35:39.431 --> 35:41.641
And I did not give you
leave to speak my name.

35:54.487 --> 35:56.406
gold cloak:
Halt!

36:01.953 --> 36:03.121
Stay back!

36:04.789 --> 36:06.750
townsperson:
We've got to get out!

36:07.417 --> 36:08.960
gold cloak:
Somebody get him!

36:09.628 --> 36:11.630
Stay back! No!

36:11.755 --> 36:13.965
Holdfast, holdfast!

36:14.090 --> 36:16.635
- Stay back! Hold!

36:21.306 --> 36:22.641
Back!

36:23.475 --> 36:26.603
Disperse, disperse!

36:27.520 --> 36:29.814
By order
of Aemond Targaryen,

36:29.940 --> 36:32.692
Prince Regent
and Protector
of the Realm...

36:32.817 --> 36:35.111
- Aemond?
- Does he mean the king?

36:35.111 --> 36:37.656
- I don't know.
- You cannot keep us here!

36:37.656 --> 36:40.617
- You are ordered
to return to your homes!
- We want meat!

36:40.617 --> 36:42.285
- Meat!
- Meat!

36:52.462 --> 36:54.005
gold cloak: Stay back!

37:01.680 --> 37:06.142
Forrest Frey:
Our Lord Grover Tully
has not declared for Rhaenyra.

37:06.142 --> 37:08.478
It means death to bare steel
against your liege,

37:08.478 --> 37:10.855
as I'm sure
my prince is aware.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.693
And against
your queen?

37:16.861 --> 37:17.862
Hm?

37:21.366 --> 37:25.328
Jason Lannister is
marshaling to the west.

37:26.162 --> 37:28.582
We need to check him
before he reaches Riverrun.

37:29.374 --> 37:31.334
That requires passage.

37:31.334 --> 37:33.670
And if Stark's
army is too slow?

37:33.670 --> 37:35.505
The wind's rising.

37:35.505 --> 37:37.215
Winter is
nigh upon us.

37:37.215 --> 37:38.717
Our hesitance
does not lie

37:38.842 --> 37:40.844
in Rhaenyra
as Queen,

37:40.844 --> 37:45.223
nor in the ruminations
of Lord Tully, the oaf.

37:45.223 --> 37:48.018
Our fear lies
in Vhagar.

37:48.018 --> 37:51.021
You fear a dragon
leagues away

37:51.021 --> 37:53.940
when mine own sits
outside your walls?

37:58.028 --> 38:01.698
- Do you offer us
your protection?
- I do.

38:07.954 --> 38:11.082
And the protection
of my uncle.

38:11.082 --> 38:15.462
And Daemon, I'm sure,
has consented to this?

38:15.587 --> 38:17.547
He will do as
his queen commands.

38:17.547 --> 38:19.549
That does lend us
some comfort.

38:19.549 --> 38:20.884
Though it
occurs to me
that dragons

38:20.884 --> 38:24.387
- cannot be
in two places at once.
- Or three.

38:27.307 --> 38:29.226
What do you want?

38:31.228 --> 38:35.148
Larys Strong has been
relieved of his castle.

38:35.148 --> 38:38.652
Does the queen intend
to raise up a new lord?

38:42.822 --> 38:44.407
You want Harrenhal.

39:03.134 --> 39:08.306
For that...
my mother will want
more than your crossing.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.143
What does
Her Grace desire?

39:14.646 --> 39:16.982
Bent knees.

40:10.702 --> 40:11.870
Up.

40:12.370 --> 40:14.164
Alys Rivers:
You were born to wield a sword,

40:14.164 --> 40:18.335
but not so much
an axe, perhaps.

40:18.335 --> 40:20.045
There are others
who would sit idle

40:20.045 --> 40:22.213
and wait for their claims
to be brought to them.

40:22.213 --> 40:25.675
- That is not my way.
- Does splitting firewood justify
what's followed you here?

40:25.675 --> 40:27.719
Let it not be said
that Daemon Targaryen

40:27.719 --> 40:30.013
failed to dirty
his hands in this war.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.182
Oh, let me
see them.

40:33.058 --> 40:35.101
- Sit.
-Ah.

40:35.227 --> 40:36.394
Sit!

40:39.898 --> 40:43.193
I hear strange things
from Bracken land,

40:43.193 --> 40:46.571
from Stone Hedge
and Lambswold and Mory.

40:47.572 --> 40:49.574
There's news, then?

40:49.574 --> 40:50.951
News?

40:52.118 --> 40:53.119
No.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.874
What I hear,
I hear in the wind.

40:57.874 --> 41:01.086
- Cries of anguish.

41:02.921 --> 41:04.923
Children being taken
from their mothers,

41:04.923 --> 41:08.885
men coming home
to find their doors
unlatched...

41:08.885 --> 41:11.263
their wives
carried away.

41:13.390 --> 41:16.142
War is a terrible thing.

41:16.268 --> 41:18.103
This is not war.

41:18.770 --> 41:21.231
These are crimes
against the innocent,

41:21.231 --> 41:23.400
that any upright man
would repudiate.

41:23.400 --> 41:26.236
Surely you haven't
mistaken me
for an upright man.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.616
The Brackens had
their chance to do
as I required.

41:31.616 --> 41:33.910
They will perhaps
think better
of their decision

41:33.910 --> 41:37.289
if their
children's lives
are staked on it.

41:38.331 --> 41:41.126
Is that
the kind of army
you would raise?

41:41.918 --> 41:44.129
Men who hate you...

41:44.629 --> 41:46.256
who serve you
under duress?

41:46.256 --> 41:49.467
Well, once they
agree to serve me,
I'll treat them fairly.

41:49.593 --> 41:50.760
Set an example
for the rest

41:50.760 --> 41:52.804
of the Riverlands
to follow.

41:52.929 --> 41:55.181
And once again,
in the name of power,

41:55.307 --> 41:58.310
it's the weak
and the women
who must endure.

42:00.979 --> 42:04.024
That fool, Aegon,
is unlike to survive.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.361
The realm will suffer
if Aemond One-Eye rules.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.489
You should pray
you never meet him.

42:11.990 --> 42:14.159
He will cut you down
soon as wish you good-day.

42:14.284 --> 42:15.827
I'd heard the same
thing about you.

42:15.952 --> 42:16.953
But I'll cross you
no further.

42:16.953 --> 42:18.496
I'm sure your tactics
are, after all,

42:18.622 --> 42:20.457
approved by
the queen.

42:25.879 --> 42:28.298
She cannot succeed,
Alys.

42:28.840 --> 42:30.967
Even if I willed it
to be so.

42:30.967 --> 42:33.011
The people who support her
will not be led by her.

42:33.136 --> 42:35.138
They look to a man
for strength.

42:35.138 --> 42:36.223
Who's better
suited to it?

42:36.348 --> 42:38.808
The Hightowers
with their scheming?

42:38.808 --> 42:41.228
Or Viserys's
first true heir?

42:42.187 --> 42:44.689
When I take
King's Landing...

42:44.689 --> 42:46.149
Rhaenyra is welcome
to join me there

42:46.149 --> 42:48.693
and take her place
by my side.

42:48.818 --> 42:52.822
King and queen...
ruling together.

42:53.323 --> 42:56.034
- And if you lose?
- Then I'll be dead,

42:56.034 --> 42:58.328
and none of this
will be my problem.

42:58.328 --> 43:01.706
It's a pity, don't you think,
that you never knew your mother?

43:05.210 --> 43:07.545
A message, Your Grace.

43:09.339 --> 43:10.340
Uh...

43:12.425 --> 43:15.262
uh, fresh news
from Stone Hedge.

43:15.387 --> 43:17.514
The Blackwoods
have overwhelmed
the Brackens,

43:17.514 --> 43:21.226
and, uh, Lord Amos
has pledged his banner
to you.

43:21.560 --> 43:23.728
House Bracken
is yours.

43:24.896 --> 43:27.857
Call Ser Willem here
so that I might
congratulate him.

43:28.191 --> 43:31.069
The Blackwoods will be
feted in these halls.

43:42.247 --> 43:44.416
I sought you
at High Tide.

43:45.041 --> 43:47.419
I was surprised
when they said
you were here.

43:48.587 --> 43:50.589
My castle is a tomb.

43:51.798 --> 43:53.967
Empty.
Haunted.

43:54.634 --> 43:57.971
I am sad
to have missed
its highest days.

43:58.763 --> 44:00.056
I imagine your
Hall of Nine

44:00.056 --> 44:02.392
filled with lords
and kings,

44:02.392 --> 44:05.645
all eager to treat
with the legendary
Lord of the Tides.

44:07.397 --> 44:08.565
The wealth you
brought back

44:08.565 --> 44:09.900
from Yi Ti
and Asshai,

44:09.900 --> 44:13.278
inspiring awe
and envy.

44:15.447 --> 44:17.657
I wonder if
any of them knew
it was all for her.

44:26.625 --> 44:29.002
Queen Rhaenyra wishes
to name you Hand.

44:32.339 --> 44:36.468
Even the death
of my wife does
not content her.

44:38.470 --> 44:40.847
Has she not asked
enough of my house?

44:41.306 --> 44:44.142
It is a sign
of her great esteem.

44:45.101 --> 44:47.020
Or does she think
the position will
compensate me

44:47.145 --> 44:49.439
for my loss?

44:49.439 --> 44:51.942
Pledge your peace
to King's Landing, then.

44:51.942 --> 44:54.361
They will accept it
most gleefully.

44:56.655 --> 44:59.616
Rather I would sail
into the West and be lost.

45:00.700 --> 45:02.494
You have done so before,

45:02.619 --> 45:05.538
at great cost to yourself
and those who loved you.

45:07.999 --> 45:11.211
Rhaenys was not
only your wife...

45:11.336 --> 45:13.797
not a thing to be
taken from you.

45:14.464 --> 45:17.842
She was
a Targaryen princess.

45:17.968 --> 45:19.177
The Queen Who Never Was.

45:19.177 --> 45:21.972
And she flew
to Rook's Rest
of her own will.

45:21.972 --> 45:24.307
- In defense of her kin.
- And she died.

45:24.307 --> 45:26.643
She died
as she would have
wished to die...

45:27.185 --> 45:30.355
with honor, in dragonfire.

45:30.855 --> 45:32.315
The way my mother chose...

45:34.359 --> 45:37.362
and the way I myself
wish to meet my end.

45:44.369 --> 45:47.664
I grieve my grandmother
who loved me

45:47.664 --> 45:49.874
but I carry her on with me.

45:50.917 --> 45:55.547
I will see Rhaenyra
ascend the Iron Throne,
as Rhaenys wished.

45:56.047 --> 45:58.216
As Rhaenys herself
should have.

46:00.677 --> 46:03.555
You yourself may do
as you see fit.

46:07.058 --> 46:08.685
Granddaughter.

46:16.067 --> 46:19.404
I would make you my heir.

46:20.864 --> 46:22.866
I am blood and fire.

46:23.283 --> 46:26.536
Driftmark must pass
to salt and sea.

46:45.096 --> 46:46.473
Your Grace.

46:50.060 --> 46:51.478
You were correct...

46:52.771 --> 46:55.732
in saying our best
hope of an army
is with Daemon.

46:58.068 --> 47:03.782
And I have, perhaps,
erred in waiting for him
to prove himself.

47:05.784 --> 47:07.786
I wish you
to go to Harrenhal.

47:09.454 --> 47:12.123
Are you removing me
from your council?

47:13.625 --> 47:14.960
Ser Alfred...

47:15.669 --> 47:19.297
I-I-I will not deny
you have tried
my patience of late,

47:19.297 --> 47:21.466
or that I would
prefer a council

47:21.591 --> 47:23.134
more inclined
to champion
their queen,

47:23.260 --> 47:25.929
but...

47:25.929 --> 47:29.266
you and your house
served my father well,

47:29.266 --> 47:32.519
and I know you will never
accept the Hightower claim.

47:34.020 --> 47:36.773
Not while I live,
Your Grace.

47:39.442 --> 47:43.113
We cannot challenge
King's Landing without
the Riverlands

47:43.113 --> 47:47.284
but I will not send
a message by raven
for Daemon to disregard.

47:49.327 --> 47:55.375
I ask you to...
reason with him.

47:55.500 --> 48:00.338
Find out
his state of mind
and his intentions.

48:02.048 --> 48:03.633
Intentions?

48:04.509 --> 48:08.305
Whether he means
to raise a host for me
or for himself.

48:11.141 --> 48:12.350
He would not dare.

48:12.475 --> 48:15.353
Have you known
Daemon to lack in daring?

48:16.855 --> 48:18.398
Go now
with haste.

48:18.523 --> 48:21.359
I'll send
good men to see
to your safety.

48:28.867 --> 48:31.536
Have you any
message for him?

48:35.165 --> 48:38.710
Tell him I would
much like to finish
our last conversation.

48:41.087 --> 48:42.505
Your Grace.

49:18.583 --> 49:20.293
Your Grace.

49:23.755 --> 49:28.093
What is it, Ser Simon?
Is the pudding now served?

49:28.635 --> 49:31.137
The Riverlords
have come, Your Grace.

49:31.263 --> 49:34.099
- They wish an audience.
- Now?

49:34.599 --> 49:37.102
- What godless hour is it?
- The wolf.

49:37.727 --> 49:39.771
They are demanding
to speak presently.

50:10.635 --> 50:14.014
I see I must begin here
with a lesson in etiquette.

50:14.139 --> 50:15.265
Or failing that,
in proper fear

50:15.265 --> 50:17.475
of your
Targaryen master.

50:18.977 --> 50:23.481
Is there some reason
you feel free to wake
a king in his bed?

50:24.190 --> 50:26.776
Or shall I now begin
your education?

50:26.776 --> 50:28.111
House Bracken

50:28.111 --> 50:31.865
have been brought
to heel at the hands
of Willem Blackwood.

50:31.990 --> 50:35.327
- That news is stale.
-  Yes.

50:35.327 --> 50:37.287
There have been,
um, complications.

50:37.287 --> 50:39.789
The sacred septs
on Bracken lands

50:39.789 --> 50:43.209
- were looted and burned.
- As were the fields and farms.

50:43.335 --> 50:44.669
The livestock
was stolen

50:44.794 --> 50:46.338
and our peasants
put to the sword.

50:46.338 --> 50:49.007
They pursued
the women
and the children.

50:49.132 --> 50:50.467
There were works
of barbarity.

50:50.467 --> 50:54.221
Punishing Bracken
for his own treasons
is one thing, aye.

50:54.346 --> 50:57.015
- But these other acts.
- The Brackens were
given their chance.

50:57.140 --> 50:59.643
- They would not see reason.
- The Blackwoods have exploited

50:59.643 --> 51:01.478
the war for the crown
to visit atrocities

51:01.478 --> 51:04.022
- upon their old rivals.
-I have seen my fair
share of their quarrels,

51:04.022 --> 51:05.565
and I tell you,
there is no honor
in a fight

51:05.690 --> 51:07.651
- such as this.
- Honor? What of common decency?

51:07.651 --> 51:10.028
These beasts
proudly carried

51:10.153 --> 51:11.905
the banner
of House Targaryen.

51:12.030 --> 51:13.865
Red dragon
on black.

51:20.205 --> 51:23.708
female voice:
A terrible war is being
fought in these lands.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.172
Have you looked
after our girls?

51:36.555 --> 51:38.557
We should've expected
nothing more from a man

51:38.682 --> 51:40.600
who ordered
the slaughter
of a child

51:40.725 --> 51:42.435
in his mother's arms.

51:44.229 --> 51:47.607
That is a lie.
And I will have the man who
told it brought before me.

51:47.732 --> 51:52.571
Well, your man is half
the kingdom, my prince.

51:55.407 --> 51:57.409
Know this, interloper:

51:57.909 --> 52:00.745
the Riverlands are
an ancient place,

52:00.870 --> 52:04.583
watched closely by
the eyes of old gods
and new.

52:04.958 --> 52:06.626
And dragon or no,

52:06.751 --> 52:10.088
we shall not raise
our banners for a tyrant.

53:17.948 --> 53:21.993
- Move along, lass.
- I have an errand...
for the lady Mysaria.

53:23.161 --> 53:24.329
I thought she was dead.

53:25.121 --> 53:27.666
Would she die without
collecting her due?

53:29.167 --> 53:31.044
I must see
an old friend.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.839
Most people want
out these days.

54:20.093 --> 54:21.052
Elinda.

55:12.771 --> 55:14.981
Was it worth
the price?

56:05.824 --> 56:07.784
Mummy.

56:24.676 --> 56:26.219
Prince Jacaerys,
Your Grace.

56:51.036 --> 56:52.370
Visenya.

56:53.204 --> 56:58.919
Vhagar's first rider,
and the first wielder
of Dark Sister.

57:00.378 --> 57:02.839
I hope you do not
mean to use her
as an example.

57:02.839 --> 57:04.549
Why shouldn't I?

57:04.549 --> 57:06.927
W-- It was
a long time ago.

57:17.020 --> 57:19.397
What is the mood
at the Twins?

57:20.899 --> 57:23.235
Did his lordship
quibble?

57:25.403 --> 57:29.366
He wishes for the Freys
to be granted Harrenhal.

57:30.742 --> 57:33.078
At war's end.
Assuming.

57:35.747 --> 57:37.290
I'm proud of you, Jace.

57:37.415 --> 57:39.918
You have
done our cause
a great service.

57:42.128 --> 57:45.131
Then, why do
you look angry?

57:53.223 --> 57:56.226
You chafed at being
prevented from action.

57:56.226 --> 57:59.062
Imagine my lot.
I'm a dragonrider as well,

57:59.062 --> 58:02.107
with a war being fought
over my ascension.

58:03.108 --> 58:05.277
And yet,
I must wait here...

58:06.278 --> 58:08.572
always prudent...

58:08.572 --> 58:09.948
sending others to fight

58:09.948 --> 58:12.409
and be felled
in my name.

58:12.784 --> 58:15.161
Even you have managed
to do your part.

58:15.745 --> 58:17.455
Jacaerys Velaryon:
You are the queen...

58:17.831 --> 58:19.082
the tie that binds us.

58:19.082 --> 58:20.792
- No harm can come to you.
- And you are my son,

58:20.917 --> 58:23.128
and I did not give
you leave to go.

58:24.963 --> 58:27.674
You do not give me
leave to go to anything.

58:28.008 --> 58:29.259
But who else is there?
Rhaenys is dead,

58:29.259 --> 58:31.136
and Baela cannot bear
the burden alone.

58:31.136 --> 58:33.805
And when Aemond
comes hunting for you?

58:33.805 --> 58:36.141
Your dragon is young.

58:36.141 --> 58:38.435
Will you fly before
Vhagar as Luke did?

58:45.150 --> 58:47.277
Perhaps
Daemon could--

58:50.655 --> 58:52.490
Daemon is not here.

58:53.199 --> 58:56.786
And Aemond now rules
in King's Landing.

58:56.786 --> 59:01.124
- Is Aegon dead?
- Dead or alive, we have
no answer for Vhagar.

59:01.124 --> 59:04.502
Aemond will not wait long
to press his advantage.
And then what?

59:06.963 --> 59:08.673
I have done all
I can from here,

59:08.798 --> 59:11.509
sent my messages,
invoked my alliances.

59:11.509 --> 59:14.137
But if all else fails,
it is I who must fight.

59:15.847 --> 59:18.642
Vhagar is big,
but Syrax is quicker.

59:18.642 --> 59:23.396
- So was Meleys.
- Meleys fought two dragons
and one of them is slain.

59:24.981 --> 59:26.191
Shall I fight
for my birthright?

59:26.316 --> 59:29.194
Or shall I wait here
until we are
all destroyed?

59:34.866 --> 59:37.035
I need dragons.

59:40.205 --> 59:43.375
We have no dearth
of dragons.

59:44.042 --> 59:47.045
We have two large
enough to stand
against Vhagar.

59:47.045 --> 59:50.340
They are
called Vermithor
and Silverwing

59:50.340 --> 59:51.883
and they sleep just
beneath our feet.

59:52.008 --> 59:53.093
Yes, and if only
they had riders,

59:53.093 --> 59:55.387
none could stand against me.

59:56.012 --> 59:59.391
I would go forth in strength
and not from necessity.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:01.935
There is Rhaena.

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:05.230
Who nearly lost
her life in her last attempt.

01:00:06.606 --> 01:00:08.608
I would not risk it again.

01:00:14.406 --> 01:00:17.576
There are those
of our line
who never ruled.

01:00:18.243 --> 01:00:21.788
Those who married
into other noble
houses,

01:00:21.913 --> 01:00:24.541
their children born
with other names.

01:00:24.541 --> 01:00:28.378
A generation ago, or more.
Their blood would be thin.

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:29.754
And yet...

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:35.218
A dragon will only
accept a dragonlord
to ride it.

01:00:35.218 --> 01:00:39.222
- Or so say the histories.
-  Valyrian histories.

01:00:39.222 --> 01:00:41.391
Written to gild us
in glory.

01:00:44.102 --> 01:00:46.897
Are you suggesting we put
a Mallister on a dragon?

01:00:47.314 --> 01:00:51.109
- A Tarly?
- It's better than
death and defeat.

01:00:56.907 --> 01:01:00.243
There are records here,
surely, of our line

01:01:00.243 --> 01:01:02.621
and of those who
fell out of it.

01:01:10.086 --> 01:01:11.755
There could be
scores of them.

01:01:19.471 --> 01:01:21.348
It's a mad thought.
