00:45.314 --> 00:47.111
<i>Basic principles:</i>

00:47.216 --> 00:49.275
<i>No woman wakes up saying:</i>

00:49.552 --> 00:52.544
<i>"God, I hope I don't get
swept off my feet today."</i>

00:55.524 --> 01:00.018
<i>Now, she might say...
"This is a really bad time for me."</i>

01:02.298 --> 01:06.496
<i>Or... something like...
"I just need some space."</i>

01:08.003 --> 01:10.254
<i>Or, my personal favorite:</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:13.468
<i>"I'm really into my career right now."</i>

01:16.514 --> 01:19.103
You believe that?
Neither does she.

01:19.103 --> 01:23.305
You know why?
Because she's lyin' to you. That's why.

01:23.826 --> 01:26.270
You understand me? Lyin'.

01:26.981 --> 01:30.859
It's not a bad time for 'er.
She doesn't need any space.

01:31.204 --> 01:32.944
And she may be into her career,

01:32.944 --> 01:36.781
but what she's really saying is, uh,
"Get away from me now."

01:36.781 --> 01:39.870
Or, possibly, "Try harder, stupid."

01:42.715 --> 01:44.002
Well, which one is it?

01:44.835 --> 01:48.957
<i>60% of all human communication
is nonverbal.</i>

01:49.345 --> 01:50.585
<i>Body language.</i>

01:50.795 --> 01:52.971
<i>30% is your tone.</i>

01:53.549 --> 01:57.060
<i>So that means that
90% of what you're sayin'...</i>

01:57.453 --> 01:58.883
ain't comin' outta your mouth.

02:02.736 --> 02:03.883
Toby! Toby!

02:05.461 --> 02:06.016
Shit!

02:06.279 --> 02:07.641
Of course she's gonna lie to you.

02:07.641 --> 02:10.348
She's a nice person,
she doesn't wanna hurt your feelings...

02:10.741 --> 02:13.230
What else she gonna say?
She doesn't even know you.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.451
Yet.

02:17.606 --> 02:20.084
<i>Luckily, the fact is that,
just like the rest of us,</i>

02:20.084 --> 02:24.457
<i>even a beautiful woman doesn't know
what she wants until she sees it.</i>

02:25.214 --> 02:26.875
<i>And that's where I come in.</i>

02:26.911 --> 02:29.046
<i>My job... is to open her eyes.</i>

02:29.046 --> 02:30.184
Toby!

02:31.620 --> 02:32.884
Oh, my God!

02:37.292 --> 02:38.968
Is this what you're looking for?

02:39.254 --> 02:42.932
Basic principles: No matter what,
no matter when, no matter who...

02:43.222 --> 02:46.924
any man has a chance
to sweep any woman off her feet.

02:47.336 --> 02:49.099
Just needs the right broom.

02:58.614 --> 03:00.454
You cannot use
what you do not have.

03:00.454 --> 03:03.466
So, if you're shy, be shy.
If you're outgoing, be outgoing.

03:03.843 --> 03:06.074
- I'm not outgoing.
- That's okay.

03:06.449 --> 03:09.871
Now, she may not want the whole truth,
but she does want the real you.

03:09.871 --> 03:13.261
She may not wanna see it all at once,
but she does want to see it.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.877
So, tonight, when you're wondering
what to say,

03:15.877 --> 03:18.091
or... how you look,
or whether or not she likes you,

03:18.091 --> 03:21.358
just remember,
she is already out with you.

03:21.970 --> 03:25.555
That means... she said yes
when she could've said no.

03:25.849 --> 03:29.767
That means she made a plan,
when she could've just blown you off.

03:30.228 --> 03:33.937
So, that means it is no longer your job
to try to make her like you.

03:34.402 --> 03:37.622
It is your job
not to mess it up.

03:38.651 --> 03:38.912
Huh?!

03:39.151 --> 03:39.913
Huh?

03:40.278 --> 03:40.736
Huh?

03:40.736 --> 03:42.910
Shoes are hot.
You went to the place I told you, right?

03:42.910 --> 03:47.742
Yeah, but... I don't...
I don't think they're really me.

03:48.367 --> 03:51.635
"You"... is a very fluid concept
right now.

03:51.635 --> 03:55.509
You bought the shoes.
You look great in the shoes.

03:55.671 --> 03:57.468
That's the you that
I'm talking about.

04:00.208 --> 04:02.557
<i>Now, the key tonight
is hang back.</i>

04:03.717 --> 04:05.385
<i>Give 'er plenty o' space.</i>

04:06.815 --> 04:09.723
<i>If she lingers at a photograph,
move on.</i>

04:11.596 --> 04:13.352
<i>But maintain the visual.</i>

04:17.499 --> 04:19.827
<i>All right, now. It's supposed
to be 64 and clear tonight.</i>

04:19.827 --> 04:22.157
<i>So when you leave the club,
walk a little.</i>

04:22.157 --> 04:24.608
<i>Ask her what she thought
about the show,</i>

04:24.822 --> 04:27.538
<i>what was her favorite photograph,
why that one.</i>

04:27.538 --> 04:30.918
<i>And when she answers,
don't be looking at her mouth.</i>

04:30.918 --> 04:33.794
<i>Don't be wondering
what she looks like naked.</i>

04:33.794 --> 04:37.751
Listen to what she is saying
and respond.

04:37.965 --> 04:40.212
Listen and respond...
Listen and respond...

04:41.012 --> 04:42.760
<i>That way,
when it's your turn to talk,</i>

04:42.760 --> 04:45.895
<i>you'll have something better
to say than "I like your mouth."</i>

04:45.895 --> 04:47.260
What was your favorite one?

04:49.178 --> 04:51.221
The, uh, elephant, definitely, yeah.

04:51.221 --> 04:54.019
<i>And all of a sudden,
we're on date number two.</i>

04:57.823 --> 04:58.664
Ready.

05:05.374 --> 05:06.292
No way.

05:08.076 --> 05:10.949
We're going back in there.
You have to smile.

05:11.329 --> 05:14.579
In case you didn't go to high school,
hitting is a good thing.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.453
<i>So, how does it happen...
great love?</i>

05:17.707 --> 05:18.545
Are you okay?

05:18.748 --> 05:20.260
<i>- Nobody knows.
- I'm good.</i>

05:20.260 --> 05:23.588
Uh, let me get a Bomb Pop
and a Screwball for the lady.

05:24.007 --> 05:28.182
<i>But what I can tell you is that
it happens in the blink of an eye.</i>

05:30.724 --> 05:32.776
<i>One moment,
you're enjoying your life.</i>

05:33.535 --> 05:36.686
<i>And the next, you wondering
how you ever lived without them.</i>

05:38.735 --> 05:40.282
<i>Three dates is all I need.</i>

05:41.400 --> 05:45.040
<i>Three dates and I'll get you here,
to the high-stakes medal round...</i>

05:45.714 --> 05:48.427
<i>where eight out of 10 women
believe that the first kiss</i>

05:48.427 --> 05:51.996
<i>will tell them everything
they need to know about the relationship.</i>

06:22.189 --> 06:24.618
<i>After that...
you're on your own.</i>

06:25.254 --> 06:26.623
<i>But always remember...</i>

06:27.456 --> 06:30.492
<i>life is not
the amount of breaths you take.</i>

06:32.127 --> 06:35.153
<i>It's the moments
that take your breath away.</i>

06:39.501 --> 06:41.464
Did I call it or did I call it?

06:41.876 --> 06:43.757
I mean,
what did I say, six months?

06:44.273 --> 06:45.814
And when was her first date?

06:46.141 --> 06:48.647
So, five and a half?
God, I hate it when I'm right.

06:49.050 --> 06:52.729
I mean, what is it about guys that makes 'em
wanna screw anything that walks,

06:52.729 --> 06:56.021
even when they're going out
with someone as awesome as Allegra Cole?

06:56.278 --> 06:58.867
I mean, she's only the single
most fabulous thing walking around New York.

06:59.100 --> 06:59.905
Thanks, Young.

06:59.905 --> 07:02.617
Are you kidding?
Of course I'm gonna run it.

07:02.617 --> 07:05.821
Why should she waste her heart
on some Swedish aristo-brat?

07:06.232 --> 07:08.111
Even if he is... gorgeous.

07:08.830 --> 07:10.041
Hey, if he's stupid enough to cheat,

07:10.041 --> 07:12.527
then the world should know
he's dumb enough to get caught.

07:12.968 --> 07:15.032
Exactly. I'm in the elevator.
I'll see you in a minute.

07:15.210 --> 07:16.498
Good morning. How are you?

07:17.827 --> 07:19.161
Bitter, party of one.

07:21.085 --> 07:22.170
Hey, you should try it sometime.

07:22.170 --> 07:25.667
Barbados by myself?
I wouldn't last five minutes.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.171
It was just
what the doctor ordered.

07:27.171 --> 07:31.092
I slept in, I did my yoga,
I read a couple of books,

07:31.092 --> 07:32.974
I flirted with my scuba instructor....

07:32.974 --> 07:36.058
- And apparently never left the office.
- I know, isn't that great?

07:36.058 --> 07:37.891
You should've taken someone with you.

07:38.308 --> 07:40.613
Who?
Who am I gonna take with me?

07:40.613 --> 07:42.912
This is where a boyfriend comes in handy.

07:42.912 --> 07:46.780
- I don't have time for a boyfriend.
- You said that two years ago.

07:47.624 --> 07:50.734
Yes, and it's as true today as it was then.

07:50.735 --> 07:51.545
- Hey!
- Hey.

07:51.545 --> 07:52.371
I thought you were on vacation.

07:52.658 --> 07:55.323
See if these are in focus, will you,
and have them in my desk in an hour?

07:55.323 --> 07:56.246
Cool.

07:56.511 --> 07:58.325
Besides,
relationships are for people...

07:58.620 --> 08:00.747
that are just waiting for
something better to come along.

08:00.747 --> 08:03.328
Ah, spoken like a true cynic.

08:03.328 --> 08:05.393
I'm not a cynic. I'm a realist.

08:05.393 --> 08:09.899
You are a realist masquerading as a cynic
who is secretly an optimist.

08:09.899 --> 08:12.353
What are you doing here?
What is she doing here?

08:12.771 --> 08:14.054
She works here, remember?

08:14.054 --> 08:17.010
No, she doesn't.
Not for another four days.

08:17.010 --> 08:19.229
- Well, this couldn't wait.
- Oh, course it could.

08:19.368 --> 08:20.643
What are you doing?
Go back to the beach.

08:20.643 --> 08:23.983
- I don't want you here.
- Oh, no, really, you do.

08:23.983 --> 08:27.317
You are becoming
a-a sick, workaholic lunatic

08:27.317 --> 08:28.741
and this is exactly...

08:28.982 --> 08:32.784
the kind of nervous,
overwrought behavior that leads to...

08:32.784 --> 08:35.919
Pictures of Sebby
with a busty brunette.

08:36.591 --> 08:39.207
A very, very big raise.

08:39.207 --> 08:42.744
Jesus!
You could find dirt in a snowstorm.

08:43.409 --> 08:44.623
Comes with the job.

08:44.997 --> 08:49.461
You know, kiddo, there is more to life
than watching other people live it.

08:50.176 --> 08:52.547
Can I help
he was cheating on my beach?

08:52.547 --> 08:55.175
Hey, I think that it's great
that you're so good at your job.

08:55.175 --> 08:57.641
I'm just a little worried as to why.

08:59.511 --> 09:00.930
Let me worry about that.

09:01.686 --> 09:04.610
Okay. I want that column
on my desk by lunch.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.195
Does that mean
you're gonna pay for my hotel?

09:06.195 --> 09:09.731
For you to sip mai tais?
I don't think so. Get out.

09:22.455 --> 09:23.792
- Oh, come on!
- What?

09:23.792 --> 09:25.123
- That's good, right?
- No.

09:25.372 --> 09:26.911
No, it was in
and it freaked out.

09:26.911 --> 09:31.169
You know what your problem is, Hitch?
You're all about the short game.

09:32.974 --> 09:35.722
You pick your shots
based on what you see first...

09:36.678 --> 09:39.553
not what's, uh,
necessarily best for you...

09:41.116 --> 09:42.239
in the long run.

09:42.563 --> 09:47.434
Well... All of us are not married to the woman
of our dreams and about to have a baby.

09:47.434 --> 09:51.148
You know, I'm very happy for you.
Just not meant for everybody.

09:51.435 --> 09:54.358
So, please, just leave me
to my hot, sweaty,

09:54.358 --> 09:57.946
totally varied, wildly experimental
short game.

09:58.654 --> 10:00.743
I was just talking about pool,
but, you know, whatever.

10:00.743 --> 10:02.097
Yeah, okay.

10:02.270 --> 10:04.669
Honestly, I just hope one day
you're able to experience

10:04.669 --> 10:08.632
the unconditional love, and the trust,
and the openness that...

10:08.839 --> 10:10.585
you know, I share with Grace
every single day.

10:10.585 --> 10:14.345
- Is-is this really barroom talk?
- No, you need to listen to me, man. I'm serious.

10:14.345 --> 10:16.632
Because when you... get to a place
with a woman like that,

10:16.632 --> 10:18.429
it's so beyond anything physical...

10:19.049 --> 10:21.057
that when I think back to
when I used to run around with you

10:21.057 --> 10:24.780
and chase all these really gorgeous
but, you know, shallow women and...

10:25.183 --> 10:30.265
I don't know, it's... it's
kind of ridiculous and vaguely... pathetic.

10:37.472 --> 10:40.576
Yeah, I see what you mean.
That's pathetic.

10:41.379 --> 10:43.545
- That... that's pathetic.
- Uh-huh.

10:44.980 --> 10:45.953
So, how'd you meet 'im?

10:46.204 --> 10:49.122
I was in La Perla, you know,
just buying some weekend thongs.

10:49.328 --> 10:51.873
- And he was doing likewise?
- No.

10:52.555 --> 10:55.176
Well, yeah. Actually, he said
he was buying somethin' for his mom.

10:55.336 --> 10:56.501
- His mom?
- Mm-hm.

10:56.972 --> 10:59.387
Casey, who buys high-priced lingerie
for their mother?

10:59.387 --> 11:01.259
Oh, well, maybe
he was looking for a robe.

11:01.470 --> 11:06.013
Casey... Casey, he was hitting on you while
he was buying lingerie for another woman.

11:06.348 --> 11:11.434
- Well... I prefer the mother story.
- I know you prefer, but that's not the point.

11:11.434 --> 11:14.484
No, the point is I'm not gonna start out
assuming the guy's a liar.

11:14.856 --> 11:16.997
- Why not?
- Because that's how you wind up...

11:18.657 --> 11:20.444
Like me?
Is that what you were gonna say?

11:20.741 --> 11:23.571
No. I was gonna say "Like you."

11:23.870 --> 11:26.000
- What's his name?
- Why?

11:26.421 --> 11:28.668
- I'm gonna Google 'im.
- No. Google your own guy.

11:28.668 --> 11:30.508
Let's just see
if his mother's still alive.

11:30.508 --> 11:33.752
- So when is Grace due again?
- Soon.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.512
- You excited?
- What'd you say?

11:37.299 --> 11:38.975
Do you want me to go get them
and bring them over here?

11:38.975 --> 11:40.962
No. No, no, no, no,
don't-don't-don't do that.

11:40.962 --> 11:43.252
Whoa! Are you saying
you don't wanna talk to them

11:43.252 --> 11:44.899
because you can't go home
with 'em?

11:44.899 --> 11:47.438
Hey, what do you want from me?
I'm just trying to keep my head above water.

11:47.438 --> 11:49.654
Hey, did you ever hear of this guy
they call the Date Doctor?

11:49.654 --> 11:50.226
Urban myth.

11:50.226 --> 11:51.603
- Really?
- Absolutely.

11:51.683 --> 11:53.407
I was kinda hoping
he also helped women.

11:53.407 --> 11:56.523
Casey, you're not sick.
You're single.

11:56.523 --> 11:59.109
You just have to relax
and enjoy the ride.

11:59.109 --> 12:01.166
I haven't been ridden in months.

12:04.793 --> 12:09.580
On that happy note, I'm gonna go see
if anybody interesting came in tonight.

12:09.580 --> 12:12.002
- Oh, you mean, besides me.
- Right.

12:12.734 --> 12:13.128
Bye.

12:13.411 --> 12:15.212
I'm gonna go get those girls,
I'm gonna bring them over here

12:15.212 --> 12:18.266
and we're gonna have a conversation
like human beings.

12:18.394 --> 12:21.770
Then you're gonna home,
and I'm gonna take 'em back to my apartment.

12:26.689 --> 12:26.717
Well, that sounds like fun for me.
But, you know, you might wanna get in line, pal.

12:27.063 --> 12:30.021
- Hey, girl. Hey.
- Hey, how are you?

12:31.645 --> 12:35.484
Hey, uh, baby, can I get a couple Coronas
over at the pool table, please? Thanks.

12:36.091 --> 12:37.576
Excuse me.

12:38.942 --> 12:41.605
- Excuse me.
- Lime wedges in the bottle's fine.

12:41.836 --> 12:43.916
Hey, asshole, I don't work here.

12:46.405 --> 12:51.416
Wow. Oh... I'm sorry. You, um...
The paramedics are gonna have

12:51.416 --> 12:53.345
to come to get my foot
outta my mouth, sweetheart.

12:53.345 --> 12:55.291
Just don't let it happen again.

12:55.878 --> 12:58.502
- I knew you didn't work here.
- You did?

12:58.934 --> 13:01.630
Well, how else was I supposed
to get you away from all those guys?

13:03.084 --> 13:04.883
Why would you wanna do that?

13:05.854 --> 13:09.148
<i>Some guys naturally develop a comfort
with the opposite sex.</i>

13:09.148 --> 13:12.765
<i>They like women, women like them.
Everything flows naturally.</i>

13:14.022 --> 13:17.898
<i>Back in college,
I was just not one of 'em.</i>

13:22.170 --> 13:24.541
<i>I seemed to lack
the basic understanding</i>

13:24.541 --> 13:27.580
<i>that my peers
just intuitively grasped.</i>

13:27.580 --> 13:32.261
<i>But like any late bloomer,
I was eager to make up for lost time.</i>

13:35.255 --> 13:38.214
<i>Her name... was Cressida Baylor.</i>

13:39.214 --> 13:41.192
Can you tell me
where the registration building is?

13:42.675 --> 13:43.338
Yeah.

13:46.027 --> 13:48.277
<i>And my life would never be the same.</i>

13:48.277 --> 13:51.062
- I'm Alex.
- Cressida.

13:54.306 --> 13:56.768
<i>What we had was beautiful.</i>

14:02.577 --> 14:03.693
I love you.

14:06.748 --> 14:08.715
I love... I love so much.

14:09.551 --> 14:11.285
I-I love you, too, Alex.

14:17.759 --> 14:20.318
I know you don't love me
as much as I love you.

14:20.318 --> 14:24.418
I mean, but that's okay. I...
I'm just glad you love me at all.

14:24.418 --> 14:28.188
<i>In retrospect, I guess
I may have come on a little strong.</i>

14:32.399 --> 14:34.636
<i>But the experience taught me a lot.</i>

14:34.943 --> 14:36.032
Cressida!

14:40.115 --> 14:40.931
What are you doin'?

14:41.916 --> 14:42.899
I'm-I'm sorry, Alex.

14:42.899 --> 14:47.135
But I love you. I love you. What just...
What did I do wrong? Just tell me what I did wrong.

14:47.135 --> 14:49.315
Dude, you're doin' it right now.

14:49.316 --> 14:50.377
Cressida!

14:51.092 --> 14:52.363
Alex, I'm sorry.

14:56.297 --> 15:00.332
<i>And it's an education
I feel obliged to pass on to my fellow men.</i>

15:04.301 --> 15:08.536
<i>Because with no guile and no game,
there's no girl.</i>

15:09.718 --> 15:12.023
<i>And if ever there was
a man born without game,</i>

15:12.936 --> 15:15.098
<i>it was Albert Brennaman.</i>

15:40.742 --> 15:45.507
<i>My business is 100% referral
and, thus far, untraceable.</i>

15:45.647 --> 15:47.102
<i>And if there's one thing
I've learned</i>

15:47.102 --> 15:50.549
<i>when you orchestrate, coordinate,
and otherwise mess with fate...</i>

15:51.260 --> 15:53.308
<i>it's best to fly under the radar.</i>

16:31.993 --> 16:34.303
I hope she's single
cause I don't do break-ups.

16:34.303 --> 16:34.982
- Hi.
- Hey.

16:34.982 --> 16:36.219
Thank you for seeing me.

16:36.427 --> 16:39.765
Uh, yeah, no. I mean, uh,
she just got out of a relationship.

16:40.502 --> 16:43.268
Is that a problem?
Because... if it is, that's fine. I'm...

16:43.671 --> 16:45.642
I'm a little uncomfortable with this anyway,
you know what I mean.

16:45.938 --> 16:50.108
Definitely... been hurt a lot. You know,
I had a lot o' bad experiences.

16:50.108 --> 16:52.782
Some good ones. You know?
But definitely a lot of bad ones and, uh...

16:54.582 --> 16:58.575
I'm desperate. Basically.
I mean, not in general, you understand?

16:58.575 --> 17:02.660
You know, not just for anybody.
But, man, for her... Yeah. I.. I... yeah. Yeah.

17:02.991 --> 17:04.289
Why don't you tell me about 'er?

17:06.377 --> 17:07.917
Oh, well, let's see, what can I say?

17:08.930 --> 17:11.915
My company handles her finances.
I'm her tax consultant.

17:11.915 --> 17:15.634
Well, I'm one of 'em.
I'm the junior man on the account.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.986
- So, does she know you're interested?
- Oh, no, no, no.

17:21.314 --> 17:21.895
No.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.190
Alive?

17:25.413 --> 17:26.972
I lent her my pen once.

17:26.972 --> 17:28.854
Shoot. Does anyone have a pen?

17:28.854 --> 17:33.083
- Here, take mine.
- Albert, you're crushing my arm.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.654
Sorry about that.
Here you go, Allegra.

17:38.953 --> 17:41.700
Allegra? As in Allegra Cole?

17:41.700 --> 17:44.534
Yeah, you know, I realize
that I'm not her usual type.

17:44.534 --> 17:48.379
Well, her last boyfriend like
owned Sweden or something.

17:48.379 --> 17:49.794
And that guy was a bum. I-I...

17:50.605 --> 17:53.002
He just... he didn't seem like
a very nice person to me.

17:54.709 --> 17:56.425
You swing for the fence.

17:56.911 --> 17:59.844
Hey, look, look, look, look, look. You don't think
I tried talking myself out of this?

17:59.844 --> 18:03.932
I mean, you don't think I know
how ridiculous this is? I-I know, okay?

18:03.932 --> 18:06.637
I just thought that
maybe, uh, with your... help I just...

18:09.891 --> 18:13.813
You know what?
I'm really sorry I... wasted your time.

18:25.306 --> 18:26.844
Hold on a second, Albert.

18:29.804 --> 18:33.764
You know what it's like...
getting up every morning, feeling hopeless?

18:34.215 --> 18:37.389
Feeling like the love o' your life
is waking up with the wrong man?

18:37.819 --> 18:41.931
But at the same time,
hoping that... she still finds happiness...

18:43.224 --> 18:44.857
even if it's never gonna be with you?

18:47.428 --> 18:50.030
You... are flat-out...

18:51.099 --> 18:54.185
out o' your mind. You know that?

18:54.531 --> 18:55.566
Yeah.

18:57.959 --> 19:01.255
- That's good.
- It is?

19:02.844 --> 19:04.409
You ever heard of Michelangelo?

19:04.625 --> 19:06.496
- Yeah.
- Heard of the Sistine Chapel?

19:06.496 --> 19:07.287
Yeah...

19:08.964 --> 19:10.051
Michelangelo.

19:11.486 --> 19:12.793
Sistine Chapel.

19:13.287 --> 19:14.718
You saying you can do this?

19:14.718 --> 19:18.174
My name is Alex Hitchens.
Let's go paint that ceiling.

19:48.222 --> 19:49.246
Take it easy.

19:51.059 --> 19:52.043
Oh, my God!

19:52.748 --> 19:53.290
Oh, God!

20:38.372 --> 20:40.631
Well, it looks like I'm still rich.

20:44.545 --> 20:48.559
But what I would really like,
and what I was wondering... is...

20:50.184 --> 20:54.202
if I could have 500,000 dollars...
to invest on my own.

20:55.110 --> 21:00.353
Oh... And what were you thinking
of investing in, Allegra?

21:01.863 --> 21:06.825
Well, it's... something
that I really have a passion for.

21:12.534 --> 21:14.914
<i>Daydreams are for private time.</i>

21:15.243 --> 21:17.081
<i>When you're in the room,
be in the room.</i>

21:17.081 --> 21:20.919
<i>Concentrate. Focus.
Women respond when you respond to them.</i>

21:20.919 --> 21:23.967
My friend Maggie is
a really talented designer.

21:24.719 --> 21:29.019
I've seen the business plan
and the samples look fantastic.

21:29.928 --> 21:34.265
And I would really... really like
to get involved.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.940
I'll tell you what.

21:40.402 --> 21:45.076
Let us come up with a range of investments
that we think you might be interested in...

21:45.406 --> 21:49.577
and next month, we'll run
the whole lot of them by you. Hm?

21:51.988 --> 21:55.548
- Okay.
- Fine. Thank you. All right, gentlemen.

21:56.284 --> 21:58.639
Let's go over this one more time.
What is the objective?

21:58.986 --> 22:00.137
Shock and awe.

22:00.137 --> 22:03.292
That was shockingly awful.
What is the objective?

22:03.292 --> 22:04.467
Shock and awe.

22:04.467 --> 22:07.174
What is the objective?!

22:07.995 --> 22:10.803
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Albert?

22:14.772 --> 22:16.678
Yes... Albert?

22:18.272 --> 22:21.814
I don't, uh-uh,
really agree... with that. Um...

22:21.814 --> 22:24.031
You don't really agree with what?

22:30.985 --> 22:33.622
I think if you wanna invest
half a million dollars in your friend's business...

22:34.409 --> 22:36.294
- that's exactly what you should do.
- Albert!

22:36.294 --> 22:38.621
No... You-you don't need us
to tell you what to do.

22:39.026 --> 22:41.849
We're a board of advisors,
we're not your kindergarten teachers.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.164
If you wanna be taken seriously
as an adult...

22:44.532 --> 22:46.629
I suggest you start
taking yourself seriously as an adult

22:46.629 --> 22:49.593
instead... of asking for permission
to invest your own money

22:49.593 --> 22:52.386
from a boardroom
full of your... daddy's golf buddies.

22:52.386 --> 22:54.435
- That's quite enough!
- You know, I'm not finished.

22:54.441 --> 22:58.651
I mean, I'd like to see anybody in this room
handle the attention and publicity...

22:59.146 --> 23:02.107
that she's had to deal with her whole life,
with half her class.

23:04.954 --> 23:09.029
We should be taking advice from you,
Miss Cole. Not the other way around.

23:09.029 --> 23:11.321
- Sit down, mister...
- No! You know what? I quit!

23:22.497 --> 23:23.580
Oh, my God!

23:34.015 --> 23:36.390
Just breathe. Just breathe.
How'd it go?

23:36.390 --> 23:39.698
I yelled at her. I screamed at my boss!
I quit my job!

23:40.922 --> 23:42.156
- What?!
- You said...

23:43.057 --> 23:44.834
- I gotta go back.
- No, I didn't tell you to quit.

23:44.980 --> 23:47.481
Relax. Okay, listen,
we're fine, we're fine. Okay?

23:47.595 --> 23:49.517
- Would you let me go?
- Albert, no, no!

23:51.432 --> 23:54.324
Just relax! Okay?

23:54.581 --> 23:57.842
- Just let it marinate for a second. Trust me.
- No!

24:08.516 --> 24:10.210
Relax. Relax.

24:10.685 --> 24:12.634
- It's Allegra Cole.
- Answer it.

24:12.920 --> 24:15.433
- Could I speak to you a second?
- Answer the door, Albert.

24:20.691 --> 24:21.767
Yes. Hi.

24:22.964 --> 24:24.018
What's up?

24:24.573 --> 24:25.938
Listen... Albert, right?

24:27.311 --> 24:32.372
- People... don't usually talk to me like that. Okay?
- Close your mouth, man.

24:32.473 --> 24:38.160
Let me... rephrase that.
People never talk to me like that.

24:39.647 --> 24:40.622
- Stand up.
- Mm-hm.

24:40.622 --> 24:43.331
I guess it's kind of scary for them.

24:44.334 --> 24:48.225
But that's why I really appreciate
what you did in there.

24:49.634 --> 24:51.378
But I was wondering, um...

24:51.630 --> 24:55.467
do you think that you and I could...
get together sometime this week?

24:58.132 --> 25:00.689
You know, to go over things...

25:01.769 --> 25:02.978
Financial things.

25:03.409 --> 25:07.397
You see, I'd-I'd like to see the areas
where I can afford to take some risks.

25:07.397 --> 25:08.940
- Check your schedule.
- Let me check my schedule.

25:10.344 --> 25:13.032
Great. Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

25:13.917 --> 25:15.663
I don't... think I have one.

25:21.022 --> 25:22.745
- Yes, I do.
- Great.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.799
And... call me Allegra.

25:39.306 --> 25:42.145
- You're done.
- Goodbye.

25:45.846 --> 25:46.738
Good job.

25:48.021 --> 25:51.065
Albert... Oh, damn.

26:12.463 --> 26:16.591
She's some kinda newspaper columnist.
Comes in here once in a while. Great tipper.

26:16.591 --> 26:17.642
What's 'er drink?

26:17.889 --> 26:21.478
Usually beer.
Tonight, Grey Goose martini, dirty.

26:31.821 --> 26:32.397
Hi.

26:34.795 --> 26:36.205
I noticed your glass was getting
a little low,

26:36.205 --> 26:39.068
so I took the liberty
of bringing you another apple martini.

26:39.068 --> 26:39.783
Thank you.

26:40.113 --> 26:44.291
And I couldn't help but notice
you look a lot like my next girlfriend.

26:45.339 --> 26:47.497
- What's your name?
- They call me Chip.

26:47.975 --> 26:49.790
Ah, you can't get 'em to stop?

26:51.312 --> 26:52.007
That was funny.

26:52.338 --> 26:55.667
Listen, Chip, I-I understand the courage
it takes to walk across a room

26:55.667 --> 26:58.008
and try to generate a relationship
outta thin air.

26:58.133 --> 27:02.593
- So, don't take the following personally.
- You have fantastic eyes.

27:03.943 --> 27:05.724
Thanks. Try to listen.

27:05.724 --> 27:10.018
A'ight.... This is no reflection on you.
I'm just not interested.

27:10.431 --> 27:12.566
But thank you for the compliment
of coming over.

27:12.566 --> 27:15.534
You welcome.
So, do you like Cuban food?

27:16.443 --> 27:20.198
Chip, seriously, that was not code for...
"I wish you'd try harder".

27:20.503 --> 27:24.257
Are you always so shut-down.. and
afraid that the right man might make you...

27:24.257 --> 27:26.447
Feel like a natural woman?

27:27.848 --> 27:30.377
Sorry I'm late, honey.
I couldn't get a cab. Uh, how was the meeting?

27:30.874 --> 27:34.584
Ooh, well, there was a-a beginning,
a middle, and an end.

27:35.289 --> 27:36.561
Nice to meet you, Chip.

27:42.563 --> 27:43.636
You, too.

27:47.094 --> 27:49.199
Now, on the one hand,
it is very difficult for a man

27:49.199 --> 27:52.067
to even speak to someone
who looks like you.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.954
But, on the other hand,
should that be your problem?

27:55.690 --> 27:57.574
So, life's kinda hard all around.

27:59.046 --> 28:00.821
No, not if you pay attention.

28:03.131 --> 28:04.620
I mean, you're sendin'
all the right signals:

28:04.620 --> 28:08.413
no earrings, heels under two inches,
your hair is pulled back,

28:08.413 --> 28:12.331
you're wearing reading glasses with no book,
drinking a Grey Goose martini,

28:12.331 --> 28:15.547
which means you had a hell of a week
and a beer just wouldn't do it.

28:15.547 --> 28:16.710
And if that wasn't clear enough,

28:16.710 --> 28:20.050
there's always the "fuck off"
that you have stamped on your forehead.

28:21.731 --> 28:23.392
Because who's gonna believe
that there's a man out there

28:23.392 --> 28:25.567
that can sit beside a woman
he doesn't know

28:25.567 --> 28:29.867
and genuinely be interested in who she is,
what she does, without his own agenda?

28:30.139 --> 28:32.733
Yeah. I wouldn't even know
what that would look like.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.111
So, what would a guy like that say?

28:35.111 --> 28:38.900
Well, he'd say "My name is Alex Hitchens
and I'm a consultant."

28:39.151 --> 28:40.401
But she wouldn't be interested in that

28:40.401 --> 28:43.241
cause she'd probably be just counting
the seconds until he left.

28:43.241 --> 28:45.950
Thinking he was like every other guy.

28:45.950 --> 28:48.996
Which, life experience has taught 'er,
is a virtual certainty.

28:49.630 --> 28:52.078
But then he'd ask her name
and what she did for a living

28:52.248 --> 28:53.873
and she might blow 'im off.

28:54.789 --> 28:56.006
Or she might say...

29:01.131 --> 29:04.931
"I'm Sara Melas.
I run the gossip column at the Standard."

29:05.312 --> 29:07.886
And then he'd ask
all these penetrating questions about her,

29:07.886 --> 29:11.476
because he was sincerely,
if atypically, interested.

29:11.719 --> 29:12.349
No.

29:13.153 --> 29:15.412
- No?
- He'd be interested.

29:16.991 --> 29:19.041
But... he'd see that
there was no way

29:19.041 --> 29:22.581
he could possibly make her realize
that he was for real.

29:23.197 --> 29:28.174
Well, he could be funny and charming
and refreshingly original.

29:29.169 --> 29:29.744
Wouldn't help.

29:30.620 --> 29:33.199
- Don't you hate it when that happens?
- Not really.

29:34.008 --> 29:37.291
They'd both probably go on
to lead the lives they were headed toward and...

29:37.511 --> 29:40.717
My guess is... they'd do just fine.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.482
It's a pleasure
to have met you, Sara Melas.

29:50.858 --> 29:53.804
Grey Goose martini
from the gentleman who just left.

29:59.700 --> 30:00.289
Is that for me?

30:04.104 --> 30:04.952
What?

30:20.521 --> 30:22.512
Vance Munson. Sorry I'm late.

30:23.547 --> 30:26.508
Oh, no. Uh, not a problem.

30:27.895 --> 30:29.341
Wow, you're-you're the...

30:30.631 --> 30:33.723
- Can I get you something to drink, Mr...
- Uh, no, no, I'm-I'm fine, thank you.

30:34.468 --> 30:35.633
So, tell me about 'er.

30:38.806 --> 30:40.197
Have you ever met someone...

30:40.607 --> 30:42.980
and you knew right away
she was gonna be important to you?

30:43.318 --> 30:46.493
Not just because of her looks,
but, you know, that X factor...

30:47.981 --> 30:48.951
How'd you meet 'er?

30:49.501 --> 30:52.577
Uh, actually, I was in a shop
buying pyjamas for my mom.

30:52.779 --> 30:54.619
And by that, of course, you mean...

30:55.122 --> 30:57.543
you were buying lingerie
for another woman.

30:59.247 --> 31:02.960
Yes. You can't help
where you meet somebody.

31:03.764 --> 31:06.417
And the... the lingerie is
for a woman I'm no longer seeing, so...

31:06.433 --> 31:08.925
But anyway, the girl I met,
the one I was talking about...

31:09.218 --> 31:11.777
she's so sweet, funny, southern...

31:12.272 --> 31:14.972
She gives me her number.
Now... she won't return my phone calls.

31:14.972 --> 31:18.860
I don't know what it is about her.
I just can't get her outta my mind.

31:19.246 --> 31:22.938
You know, food has lost its taste.
Colors, you know, they seem dull and...

31:23.149 --> 31:26.531
Things that used to matter...
I don't know, they just no longer do.

31:27.287 --> 31:29.574
I think things aren't gonna
snap back unless I...

31:32.159 --> 31:33.531
Unless I bang 'er.

31:36.096 --> 31:37.215
Excuse me?

31:39.199 --> 31:42.093
You know, bang 'er. Clear my head.
Get in, get off, get out.

31:45.439 --> 31:48.423
I think you may have misunderstood
what I do exactly.

31:48.423 --> 31:51.128
No, I was told you help guys
get in there.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.320
Right. But, see, here's the thing.

31:53.320 --> 31:57.051
My clients actually like women.

31:59.699 --> 32:01.990
Uh, yeah, hit-hit it and quit it
is-is not my thing.

32:01.990 --> 32:06.106
Let me make one thing clear to you, rabbi.
I need professional help.

32:06.106 --> 32:09.160
Well, that is for damn certain.

32:09.696 --> 32:13.238
And I'm glad you can admit it
because generally that's the hardest part.

32:17.204 --> 32:19.701
You see what I'm doin'?
This is what I'm about.

32:21.241 --> 32:23.091
Power suit, power tie,
power steering.

32:23.091 --> 32:26.752
People can wince, cry, beg,
but eventually they do what I want.

32:28.046 --> 32:31.049
Oh... So, that's, like, a metaphor.

32:32.841 --> 32:33.634
Oh, yeah.

32:34.052 --> 32:36.612
Right. Well, see,
I'm more of a literal kinda guy.

32:37.224 --> 32:38.179
So, when I do this...

32:41.061 --> 32:45.019
this is more like me sayin'
that I will literally break your shit off

32:45.019 --> 32:48.066
if you ever touch me again.
Okay, pumpkin?

32:48.402 --> 32:49.186
Got it.

32:57.678 --> 32:59.176
No. No!

32:59.746 --> 33:03.097
Pablo, I can't just mention your restaurant.
Somebody has to eat there.

33:04.117 --> 33:06.810
No, somebody famous.
You know that.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.450
- Sara Melas?
- No, no, no, no, no.

33:09.890 --> 33:11.514
Okay. Bye.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.643
I need your signature.

33:29.539 --> 33:34.076
<i>I... hate it when a guy calls a girl
who did not give him her number.</i>

33:34.239 --> 33:36.238
<i>So, this is me not calling. Over.</i>

33:36.577 --> 33:39.491
Yes, you're right.
This is much less invasive.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.291
Listen, I've been thinkin' about
that sign on your forehead.

33:42.496 --> 33:46.294
And I was wondering if you'd mind
taking it down for dinner Friday night. Over.

33:47.419 --> 33:50.795
Ooh, I can't. I have a couple parties
I have to hit.

33:51.381 --> 33:52.923
<i>Uh, gossip never sleeps.</i>

33:53.634 --> 33:55.382
Not till about 4:00 a.m.

33:56.136 --> 33:56.927
Saturday.

34:00.180 --> 34:01.801
I, um, I have a date.

34:03.219 --> 34:05.862
Do you know the definition
of "perseverance", Miss Melas?

34:06.480 --> 34:08.308
An excuse to be obnoxious?

34:08.748 --> 34:10.356
<i>Continuing in a course of action</i>

34:10.356 --> 34:14.481
without regard to discouragement,
opposition or previous failure. Over.

34:15.489 --> 34:17.187
Okay, Webster,
how do I get rid o' you?

34:17.649 --> 34:20.458
Breakfast, Sunday.
And you can barely even call that a date.

34:20.458 --> 34:24.210
You do that with out-of-town relatives
that you don't even like. Over.

34:28.668 --> 34:29.828
Come on.

34:32.438 --> 34:34.382
Okay, I guess I could do Sunday.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.440
You forgot to say "over". Over.

34:38.210 --> 34:41.137
This conversation's over
as soon as you tell me when and where.

34:41.380 --> 34:44.217
7:00 a.m., North Cove Marina.
Over and out.

34:44.480 --> 34:48.599
7:00 a.m.? Are you crazy?
I-I-I don't do 7:00 a.m.

34:50.657 --> 34:51.898
- Hello?
- Sign here.

34:52.315 --> 34:53.777
- What?
- You said Sunday, right?

34:53.777 --> 34:54.570
Yeah.

34:58.298 --> 34:59.530
What if I would have said Friday?

35:00.867 --> 35:01.839
Sunday?

35:06.306 --> 35:08.334
So, I guess
you're not going to church.

35:21.855 --> 35:24.030
Do you really expect me
to wear this?

35:26.093 --> 35:27.977
It'll be awful cold out there
without it.

35:28.729 --> 35:31.310
- Good morning.
- "Good" would have been at 10:00.

35:36.269 --> 35:38.200
You're a lot taller than I remember.

35:38.705 --> 35:39.910
You ever ride one o' these?

35:40.569 --> 35:41.704
Not on the Hudson.

35:42.542 --> 35:45.079
So, what do you wanna do?
Race me around the Statue of Liberty?

35:45.079 --> 35:46.398
If there's time.

35:47.748 --> 35:49.873
- But you might need these.
- All right.

35:50.201 --> 35:51.666
- Bam.
- Wow.

35:53.086 --> 35:54.258
How do I look?

35:55.856 --> 35:56.832
Fabulous.

35:58.959 --> 36:00.433
All right, I give.

36:01.300 --> 36:02.551
Where do I change?

36:04.131 --> 36:08.481
So, we'll go out past the wall, take a left...
It is pretty much a straight shot from there.

36:08.644 --> 36:11.985
- Straight shot to where?
- That's for me to know and you to find out.

36:12.239 --> 36:13.520
So, look, what you do
with these babies is...

36:13.520 --> 36:16.607
Yeah, what I do with this baby
is kick your ass.

37:28.415 --> 37:31.019
- What happened? You change your mind?
- It just died.

37:32.986 --> 37:34.480
Did you put gas in it?

37:35.061 --> 37:38.815
Yeah, no. Um, you know, I think it must
have sucked up a diaper or somethin'.

37:39.029 --> 37:41.727
Gross. Try it again.

37:45.532 --> 37:46.835
You want me to call AAA?

37:46.835 --> 37:49.323
Come on around
and let me hop over too.

37:49.870 --> 37:53.199
I don't know. What if you break mine, too?
Then we'll both be sitting ducks.

37:53.199 --> 37:57.370
- I didn't break it. It just died.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:57.511 --> 37:58.668
All right, hop on.

38:00.967 --> 38:03.588
- Uh, scoot back.
- Hitch, I'm already here.

38:04.381 --> 38:05.837
Oh, yeah, but you don't know
where we're goin'.

38:06.131 --> 38:08.773
Well, why don't you tell me?
And then we'll both know.

38:08.773 --> 38:10.138
Sara...

38:11.724 --> 38:13.485
Man, male egos.

38:13.593 --> 38:15.848
I don't know how you guys
make it through the day with them.

38:15.848 --> 38:18.227
What? It is not my ego.

38:18.436 --> 38:20.605
I just... I don't wanna
ruin the surprise.

38:24.778 --> 38:26.862
Sara! Sara!

38:31.611 --> 38:33.286
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

38:36.483 --> 38:39.331
There. I always keep
a few of those around.

38:39.331 --> 38:40.166
Thank you.

38:40.166 --> 38:44.297
I have lower back trouble.
I just shove the ice packs right down there.

38:44.939 --> 38:47.058
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's a fresh one.

38:48.995 --> 38:50.690
So, Ellis Island.

38:50.964 --> 38:54.387
I have to admit, I have lived in New York
my whole life and I've never been here.

38:54.387 --> 38:56.396
Yeah, I figured that.
Most people haven't.

38:56.396 --> 38:59.116
So I got my man Larry here
to set us up a private tour.

38:59.281 --> 39:01.564
- Oh, great!
- Anything for Hitch.

39:03.157 --> 39:06.152
It was originally known
as Oyster Island.

39:06.152 --> 39:08.857
The island was expanded
to its present size

39:08.857 --> 39:13.319
with dirt removed during the construction
of the New York subway system.

39:14.030 --> 39:15.580
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

39:15.580 --> 39:16.622
Did you know this?

39:16.995 --> 39:19.041
Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's-that's
why I brought you here.

39:19.041 --> 39:23.661
In fact, over 100 million Americans
can trace their ancestry

39:23.966 --> 39:27.970
back to a single man, woman,
or child on the ship's manifest...

39:28.141 --> 39:30.009
to an inspector's ledger.

39:30.761 --> 39:35.598
By 1910,
75% of the residents of New York,

39:35.860 --> 39:39.441
Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, and Boston

39:39.546 --> 39:41.644
were immigrants,
or the children of immigrants.

39:42.187 --> 39:45.397
They generally lived
in the poorest sections of the cities,

39:46.190 --> 39:49.410
in Little Italys, Chinatowns
and other ethnic enclaves.

39:50.530 --> 39:52.238
It's called "The Kissing Post".

39:53.115 --> 39:57.288
The plaque explains how different cultures
kiss after long absences.

39:58.453 --> 40:02.040
Now, what exactly would qualify
as a long absence?

40:02.455 --> 40:03.301
I mean...

40:04.586 --> 40:07.137
- That count?
- No.

40:10.744 --> 40:14.894
I, uh... I actually had... a relative
come through here.

40:15.558 --> 40:16.762
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:19.196 --> 40:19.985
What?

40:21.354 --> 40:24.536
- What?
- What... was that thing?

40:25.566 --> 40:28.732
No, uh... You know,
I was just thinkin' that, uh...

40:29.596 --> 40:33.238
you can't really know where
you're goin' until you know where you been.

40:33.491 --> 40:35.912
- Ain't that right, Larry?
- Amen, brother.

40:36.499 --> 40:38.911
Kinda deep for a first date,
don't you think?

40:43.677 --> 40:45.041
What is that?

41:03.645 --> 41:05.394
Oh, my God!

41:12.038 --> 41:16.466
That's my great-great-grandfather.
That... that's his signature. I... I mean...

41:16.876 --> 41:18.841
Jesus, it's right here!

41:21.881 --> 41:23.668
How did you... how did you know?

41:24.884 --> 41:27.426
Hitch did the search.
I just found the page.

41:51.444 --> 41:52.809
I'm sorry.

42:02.124 --> 42:05.092
I saw that... goin' differently
in my mind.

42:07.706 --> 42:11.966
So, my family never saw 'im again.
Well, except for on the Wanted posters.

42:12.469 --> 42:14.713
Look, I'm... I'm really sorry.

42:15.635 --> 42:20.180
When I saw it on the computer, it said
"the Butcher of Cadiz". You know, what, uh...

42:21.021 --> 42:25.932
I tho-I thought it was a profession...
not a... headline.

42:27.230 --> 42:30.934
It's just one o' those horrible family legacies
we've all tried to forget.

42:32.952 --> 42:35.275
But thank you.
No, it was...

42:35.889 --> 42:37.982
- A train wreck. Yeah.
- No.

42:38.124 --> 42:39.532
Let me get you a cab.

42:44.397 --> 42:45.513
Thanks.

42:47.967 --> 42:49.867
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

42:59.679 --> 43:00.845
Taxi!

43:04.517 --> 43:06.569
Poor guy. Sounds like
he went through a lot o' trouble.

43:06.936 --> 43:11.439
It was fun. In a disastrous kinda way.
I mean, this isn't exactly a hickey.

43:12.986 --> 43:14.732
At least you got a good story
out of it, right?

43:18.731 --> 43:19.366
Right?

43:19.530 --> 43:23.240
- You should try mine, it's great.
- Wait, wait. You're seeing him again?

43:25.038 --> 43:27.577
Well, look. You said that
I'm always expecting men

43:27.577 --> 43:29.832
- to... let me down, right?
- Yeah.

43:29.832 --> 43:32.838
- Assuming that they're gonna fail?
- Which he did.

43:34.169 --> 43:37.047
Yeah, but he did it with flair.

43:39.342 --> 43:44.395
- I mean, Case, he really tanked.
- And that's a desirable trait?

43:45.437 --> 43:48.149
Yeah. Weird, huh?

43:50.864 --> 43:53.160
Now, just... keep it simple.
Just like we practiced.

43:53.160 --> 43:54.785
We're just leavin' a message, okay?

43:54.785 --> 43:57.958
Women like Allegra Cole
don't pick up numbers they don't recognize.

44:01.653 --> 44:02.659
<i>Hello?</i>

44:03.781 --> 44:05.505
She's on the phone!

44:07.872 --> 44:09.757
- Uh, yes. Hello. Miss Cole?
- Yeah.

44:09.757 --> 44:11.664
Hi, I have Albert Brennaman for you.

44:12.385 --> 44:14.516
- One moment, please.
- No. Te-tell her I'm at lunch.

44:14.516 --> 44:17.476
We called her to tell her
you're at lunch?

44:22.509 --> 44:26.611
Allegra.
Hi, it's, uh, Al-bert Brennaman.

44:27.734 --> 44:28.973
Hi, how are you?

44:29.272 --> 44:31.611
Good. Good. I'm doing good.

44:31.978 --> 44:35.328
The reason I'm calling is, uh, about
our appointment this Wednesday.

44:35.942 --> 44:37.699
Not gonna be able to make it.

44:37.699 --> 44:40.739
Oh! Uh... well, when can you make it?

44:41.581 --> 44:42.657
Uh, when can I do it?

44:42.865 --> 44:49.286
Uhh... I don't even know,
cause my whole next week is slammed.

44:50.523 --> 44:52.915
Right. But it's all good. Yeah.
It's all good.

44:54.007 --> 44:57.372
Uh-huh... No, we're gonna
make it happen though, that's for sure.

44:58.549 --> 45:00.835
We're gonna make it happen. Yes.

45:08.237 --> 45:10.881
Are y... What's goin' on over there?

45:10.881 --> 45:13.100
Just moving some things around.

45:15.288 --> 45:16.563
Sky Studios.

45:16.563 --> 45:19.985
Look, tonight I'm actually going
to this fashion thing at Sky Studios.

45:20.453 --> 45:21.408
- Designer friend....
- Yeah.

45:21.408 --> 45:25.738
I just thought it might be something your...
designer friend Maggie would be interested in.

45:25.738 --> 45:27.119
Yeah, definitely.

45:27.290 --> 45:31.462
Well, great. Great. Well, then
I will put you back on with my assist...

45:49.882 --> 45:52.109
- Allegra, over here, please.
- Miss Cole, this way.

45:52.285 --> 45:53.070
Great. One more.

45:53.438 --> 45:56.852
- Hi, there.
- This was a fantastic idea.

45:57.156 --> 45:59.568
I suppose.
Hey, where's Maggie?

46:00.059 --> 46:01.399
Late as usual.

46:03.763 --> 46:07.411
Tonight, I want you to meditate
on the image of an iceberg.

46:07.785 --> 46:09.531
Do you know
why I want you to do that?

46:10.003 --> 46:10.544
Because I'm cool?

46:11.804 --> 46:13.247
- No.
- I know, I'm not. I...

46:13.247 --> 46:15.840
Uh... I'm sayin'
that you are an iceberg

46:15.840 --> 46:20.458
in that over 90% of your mass
is below the surface.

46:21.114 --> 46:22.184
I know I'm heavy. I am.

46:22.516 --> 46:26.262
No, uh-uh... I'm talkin' about
who you are. It-it's a metaphor.

46:26.853 --> 46:27.885
Accounting, business,

46:27.885 --> 46:32.888
all of that is just... a small part
of a much deeper, richer Albert.

46:34.142 --> 46:34.826
One more.

46:36.068 --> 46:36.570
Okay.

46:36.829 --> 46:37.939
I know,
it's gonna be loud in there,

46:37.939 --> 46:40.443
so this is our opportunity
to break the touch barrier

46:40.614 --> 46:41.864
in a non-sleazy way.

46:41.864 --> 46:45.000
So, get to where it's loudest.
Ask her if she'd like a drink.

46:45.191 --> 46:47.655
Lean in, place your hand
on the small of her back

46:47.789 --> 46:49.781
and say it in her ear
like a secret.

46:49.781 --> 46:52.992
Watch your hand placement.
Too high says "I just wanna be friends."

46:53.201 --> 46:55.871
Too low says
"I just wanna grab some ass."

46:56.581 --> 46:59.597
Friends. Ass. Me.

47:04.841 --> 47:07.142
Special issues:
Allegra Cole is a celebrity,

47:07.142 --> 47:10.179
which means that when people talk to her,
they'll ignore you completely.

47:10.179 --> 47:12.445
You know? She's classy,
so she'll introduce you.

47:12.636 --> 47:16.185
When she does, shake hands hard and
speak up. Let them know that you're there.

47:16.185 --> 47:18.024
Show her you can handle
being her escort.

47:18.024 --> 47:21.105
- Egon, this is Albert.
- How you doin'?

47:21.661 --> 47:23.978
- Albert, this is Zak.
- Nice to see you.

47:24.396 --> 47:26.156
- These guys are friends with Maggie.
- Oh!...

47:26.156 --> 47:29.277
- Have you been to that new Brazilian restaurant?
- No, but I am looking...

47:29.277 --> 47:32.010
It's disgusting.
I'm writing an article about it.

47:32.990 --> 47:35.452
And... did you see
the new installation at MOMA?

47:35.910 --> 47:38.497
- Yes. Did you think...
- Disgusting. Disgusting.

47:40.377 --> 47:43.179
Uh, women can always tell
when you're not being real with them.

47:43.930 --> 47:47.226
Worst thing you can do is try to fake it,
because you are a great guy.

47:47.516 --> 47:50.878
And you do have something
to offer Allegra that no other man does.

47:52.038 --> 47:53.329
What was your name?
Eggnog?

47:55.227 --> 47:56.054
Egon.

47:56.825 --> 48:00.060
What do you think of the design of the Jets'
new football stadium on the West Side?

48:00.645 --> 48:03.696
- Uhh..
- Lemme guess. Disgusting?

48:04.650 --> 48:06.854
Think it over. We'll be back.

48:08.955 --> 48:11.749
Thank you.
I can't stand those guys.

48:11.999 --> 48:14.169
Really? I kinda liked them.

48:14.560 --> 48:15.997
But, when all is said and done...

48:16.367 --> 48:19.122
tonight... is not about Allegra.

48:19.966 --> 48:22.415
- It's not?
- No. Tonight is about Maggie.

48:22.667 --> 48:26.797
A woman's best friend has to sign off
on all big relationship decisions.

48:27.173 --> 48:28.589
So you can't afford to mess this up.

48:28.589 --> 48:31.221
Albert, I want you to meet
my friend, Maggie.

48:31.800 --> 48:32.759
Hi, Maggie.

48:32.759 --> 48:35.849
- It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
- I'm... Maggie.

48:37.250 --> 48:40.242
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, actually... I am.

48:40.853 --> 48:43.935
Magnus Forester.
Thank you so much for inviting us.

48:46.559 --> 48:48.576
- You have very soft hands.
- Thank you.

48:50.775 --> 48:52.914
- Wow. So do you.
- Thank you.

48:53.067 --> 48:57.452
So, tonight, you focus on one thing
and one thing only.

48:57.804 --> 48:58.375
Maggie.

48:58.529 --> 49:01.870
- Where does your... inspiration come from?
- Oh, my God.

49:03.276 --> 49:04.541
Anything I see.

49:05.278 --> 49:08.719
Something in a magazine...
out on the street...

49:09.615 --> 49:10.338
in an old movie...

49:11.468 --> 49:15.308
The receptive nature of the creative facility
just astounds me.

49:15.509 --> 49:17.318
Ooh. Anybody want any spring rolls?

49:17.318 --> 49:20.980
That's a beautiful tie, by the way.
I mean, this whole thing, it just works.

49:21.188 --> 49:22.310
Thank you.

49:24.228 --> 49:26.854
- Is he gay?
- I don't think so.

49:28.935 --> 49:29.561
I like 'im.

49:29.561 --> 49:34.445
Now, 'bout the DJ. Um, generally,
I have a firm no-dancing policy.

49:34.445 --> 49:37.406
But... if she asks, you cannot say no.

49:37.406 --> 49:40.291
That's the one thing I'm not worried about.
But if there are people there and...

49:40.291 --> 49:45.748
I'm sorry... I hate to be a stickler, but,
you kn... I... need to be thorough. Mm, um...

49:46.552 --> 49:48.758
Show me what you mean
by you're not worried about it.

49:49.097 --> 49:52.045
Trust me. You know...

49:54.527 --> 49:56.346
That's what it's all about,
right there.

49:57.050 --> 49:58.349
See how it gets bigger?

50:01.934 --> 50:03.521
Now I'm gonna start the fire.

50:03.803 --> 50:07.436
But the feet are goin'.
I start the fire, I make the pizza.

50:07.436 --> 50:09.097
Hips are always goin'.

50:10.877 --> 50:14.862
Can't get enough hip.
From there... the Q-Tip.

50:15.915 --> 50:18.987
Q-Tip. Q-Tip. Throw it away.

50:19.986 --> 50:21.418
That's not workin', hit 'em with this.

50:30.763 --> 50:35.128
Don't... ever...
do that again.

50:37.270 --> 50:38.385
Do you hear me?

50:39.135 --> 50:40.942
- Just expressing myself.
- No.

50:41.432 --> 50:45.716
No. Mm-mm. Not like that,
you're not. All right?

50:48.814 --> 50:50.272
This is where you live.

50:51.150 --> 50:51.690
Right here.

50:52.652 --> 50:55.356
You live right here. Okay?
This is home.

50:56.109 --> 50:57.118
None o' this.

50:57.957 --> 50:59.237
I don't wanna see none o' that.

50:59.725 --> 51:01.783
Don't need no pizza.
They got food there.

51:09.790 --> 51:13.045
Elbows, 6 inches from the waist,
90-degree angles.

51:13.265 --> 51:16.007
Don't-don't you bite your lip.
Stop it.

51:35.030 --> 51:38.378
Okay? Women relate dancing to sex.
All right?

51:38.378 --> 51:41.489
Even a great dancer can lose it
with one o' these.

51:42.864 --> 51:45.242
Okay, see, now that's what
I need to be learnin'.

51:56.596 --> 51:57.721
Can't stop it.

51:58.517 --> 52:00.426
You cannot stop it.

52:02.822 --> 52:04.054
Next subject.

52:06.092 --> 52:06.599
Get out.

52:12.231 --> 52:12.938
Thanks.

52:13.689 --> 52:16.038
So... you're a Knicks fan?

52:17.901 --> 52:19.068
When they're good.

52:24.285 --> 52:25.654
- Hey.
- Hey.

52:26.278 --> 52:28.293
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, God. Why?

52:29.749 --> 52:31.916
- She was there?
- I left you a bunch o' messages.

52:32.618 --> 52:35.515
- My phone fell in the Hudson.
- Yeah, well, it gets worse.

52:39.462 --> 52:40.274
I don't believe this.

52:40.274 --> 52:41.472
I thought he was a bodyguard.

52:41.472 --> 52:44.228
Yeah, well, the only one who's gonna
need protection around here is me.

52:45.197 --> 52:47.469
- Max is gonna...
- Gonna be really irritated.

52:48.057 --> 52:51.648
You know, when I got the train this morning,
I thought it was gonna be a good day.

52:52.354 --> 52:54.979
Who the hell is Albert Brennaman?

52:55.282 --> 52:58.480
- I need you to tell me how this happened.
- What? There were some photographers.

52:58.574 --> 53:00.735
Look. Does this even
look like dancin' to you?

53:01.153 --> 53:03.071
That's just a little bit o' me...
being me.

53:03.071 --> 53:05.951
No, Albert. That's, uh, you bein'
a lot o' bit o' somethin'

53:05.951 --> 53:07.699
you don't need to ever be again.

53:08.454 --> 53:09.910
- It's just one dance.
- No.

53:10.656 --> 53:14.998
One dance, one look, one kiss.
That's all we get, Albert.

53:14.998 --> 53:17.627
Just one shot to make the difference

53:17.627 --> 53:20.374
between... happily ever after and...

53:20.374 --> 53:24.144
"Oh, he's just some guy
I went to some thing with once."

53:25.441 --> 53:26.267
All right?

53:31.849 --> 53:34.719
- What?
- You-you said "kiss".

53:37.397 --> 53:38.653
Is... that a problem?

53:38.653 --> 53:40.314
It's... it's not a problem,

53:40.314 --> 53:42.122
- but, I don't know, this is Allegra Cole.
- Albert...

53:42.722 --> 53:44.535
Eight outta 10 women believe
that the first kiss

53:44.535 --> 53:47.827
will tell them everything that
they need to know about a relationship.

53:47.948 --> 53:51.579
And believe me,
she has definitely thought about it.

53:52.198 --> 53:54.096
- She has?
- Ow, of course.

53:54.096 --> 53:58.045
I mean, not that she's gonna
act on it. So, it's no real big deal.

53:58.504 --> 54:01.303
- All right, it's no big deal then.
- It's a very big deal, Albert!

54:01.303 --> 54:02.756
- Huge.
- Monumental!

54:02.756 --> 54:05.048
You are not listen...

54:06.399 --> 54:08.134
I need you
to wrap your head around this.

54:08.573 --> 54:11.137
Tomorrow night, Allegra Cole...

54:11.767 --> 54:15.536
could have her last... first... kiss.

54:26.322 --> 54:28.822
All right, come on,
uh, just show me what you got.

54:29.507 --> 54:32.369
- What do you... what do you mean?
- Just, uh, show me how you would kiss me.

54:33.205 --> 54:33.901
I wouldn't kiss you.

54:34.512 --> 54:35.873
I'm not me, I'm Allegra.

54:39.145 --> 54:40.772
But you're really not, so...

54:40.880 --> 54:44.600
Okay, Albert, end o' the night,
you're droppin' me off at home...

54:44.984 --> 54:45.634
Show me the magic.

54:45.634 --> 54:47.252
Yeah, you know, I'm really
not comfortable with this.

54:47.252 --> 54:50.885
God, Albert,
I had such a wonderful time with you.

54:51.052 --> 54:52.723
Yeah, how 'bout those Knicks, huh?

54:52.887 --> 54:58.352
Hey... You see what I'm doin'? All right?
This is a signal. Okay? I'm fiddlin' with my keys.

54:58.731 --> 54:59.937
All right?
A woman that doesn't want a kiss...

55:00.398 --> 55:02.435
takes her keys out, puts them in the door,
goes in the house.

55:02.435 --> 55:05.024
A woman that wants to kiss, she fiddles.

55:06.500 --> 55:07.570
I'm fiddling.

55:08.071 --> 55:09.461
Okay, you have a good night now...

55:11.206 --> 55:13.419
- You see what I'm doin'?
- Robbing me?

55:13.419 --> 55:14.477
No.

55:14.916 --> 55:17.621
See, this is what most guys do.
They rush in to take the kiss.

55:18.056 --> 55:20.166
But you're not most guys.

55:20.349 --> 55:24.543
See, the secret to a kiss...
is to go 90% o' the way...

55:25.958 --> 55:27.226
and then hold.

55:32.164 --> 55:34.054
- For how long?
- As long as it takes...

55:34.551 --> 55:36.025
for her to come the other 10.

55:36.483 --> 55:38.391
Okay, 90-10. Got it.

55:38.391 --> 55:42.027
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Shake it off. It's your turn.

55:45.698 --> 55:48.280
I had a really nice time tonight, Albert.

55:50.883 --> 55:54.032
I had a... great time tonight,
too, Allegra...

55:56.088 --> 55:57.243
with a beard.

56:31.056 --> 56:31.527
What's up?

56:32.925 --> 56:34.953
- I'm not feelin' it.
- What do you mean? I came 90.

56:35.866 --> 56:37.408
It's just... I'm not feelin'
like you want it.

56:37.622 --> 56:42.432
Look, I'm Allegra Cole,
the woman of your dreams.

56:42.432 --> 56:46.041
The woman whose green eyes
are limpid pools of desire.

56:46.041 --> 56:48.460
Now, show me the magic, Albert.
Show me the magic...

56:49.275 --> 56:51.101
- What the hell was that?!
- I'm showin' you the magic! I...

56:51.101 --> 56:53.544
No, I said come 90
and then I come 10!

56:53.674 --> 56:55.216
You don't go the whole hundred!

56:55.216 --> 56:58.933
My mouth was open, Albert.
You overeager son of a...

57:02.644 --> 57:03.853
Other than that, how was it?

57:05.068 --> 57:07.689
They came together, they danced together,
and they left together.

57:08.894 --> 57:10.998
He's cute,
in a sheepdog kind of way.

57:11.323 --> 57:13.406
Hey, for all I know,
he's adorable.

57:13.866 --> 57:15.750
But him dating her is...

57:16.268 --> 57:17.574
You seem stressed.

57:17.574 --> 57:19.200
You and I had an understanding.

57:19.200 --> 57:21.371
If you invite Allegra,
you're supposed to call me.

57:21.371 --> 57:23.539
Sara, I didn't invite her.

57:24.143 --> 57:26.043
Honestly, sweetie,
I thought she was still in Europe.

57:26.597 --> 57:28.841
- So, you invited Albert?
- No.

57:29.509 --> 57:33.551
Look, it says here the tickets went
to some guy named... Alex Hitchens.

57:33.919 --> 57:34.594
What?

57:46.118 --> 57:47.150
Machine.

57:51.025 --> 57:52.288
Hi, it's Sara.

57:52.288 --> 57:58.577
Um... I just wanted
to, uh, to say thank you...

57:58.874 --> 58:03.664
for a... an unforgettable experience...

58:04.083 --> 58:04.919
the other day.

58:06.639 --> 58:08.792
And, uh, if you ever wanna see
your shirt again,

58:08.792 --> 58:13.180
you can... you can come by
the Fulton Fish Market tonight, around 8 o'clock .

58:13.559 --> 58:15.185
Okay. Bye.

58:18.853 --> 58:21.012
- You think he'll show?
- Yeah.

58:21.767 --> 58:24.238
He's too much of a player
to have a bad date on his record.

58:24.643 --> 58:27.890
Is this a, uh, source or... a date?

58:28.974 --> 58:30.021
A source.

58:31.032 --> 58:32.937
Well, it sounded like... a date.

58:33.979 --> 58:35.446
Well, it was supposed to.

58:37.030 --> 58:41.084
So, it-it... it looks like a date
and it sounds like a date,

58:41.084 --> 58:45.119
- but... it's not a date.
- Yeah. Right.

58:46.525 --> 58:47.170
Just checkin'.

59:07.643 --> 59:10.239
Hi. I wasn't sure
you got my message.

59:10.353 --> 59:15.025
Well, I wasn't sure you called the right guy.
Uh... You must be a glutton for punishment.

59:15.571 --> 59:17.914
Either that or I really
wanna pay you back.

59:18.824 --> 59:20.689
I think this is yours.

59:21.627 --> 59:24.956
Thank you. I... I'm gonna frame this
for my wall of shame.

59:25.241 --> 59:27.328
Really? There's a whole wall?

59:27.512 --> 59:28.705
So, what are we gettin' into?

59:31.765 --> 59:33.464
Ever been to a food rave before?

59:33.464 --> 59:37.588
Happens once a month, all around the city.
Different chefs, different venues...

59:38.198 --> 59:38.857
You any good in the kitchen?

59:38.857 --> 59:41.353
Well, I can stand the heat,
if that's what you mean.

59:41.353 --> 59:44.775
Good. Cause that's my boss
and his wife right over there.

59:45.741 --> 59:46.894
- Interesting.
- Mm-hm.

59:47.323 --> 59:51.318
Well, here's a concept:
we're paying to cook our own food.

59:51.318 --> 59:54.374
Here's another concept:
Shut up. It's an evening out.

59:54.374 --> 59:56.459
I tell you, the longer you're married,
the less you go out.

59:56.459 --> 01:00:00.698
In a couple of years, we're gonna end up
bricked into our apartment like a Poe story.

01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.872
So, Louise, are you...
in the newspaper business, also?

01:00:04.872 --> 01:00:06.455
Oh, no, I'm a psychiatrist.

01:00:07.618 --> 01:00:11.260
Well... Uhh, that's the last thing
I'm gonna say tonight.

01:00:12.206 --> 01:00:15.502
So, uh, Sara, you never told me.

01:00:15.863 --> 01:00:19.638
How was the Sky Studio fashion thing
you went to the other night?

01:00:19.638 --> 01:00:24.679
- Did you... meet anyone worth mentioning?
- Uh... no. Mm-mm.

01:00:26.323 --> 01:00:29.990
Really? I find that... very odd.

01:00:30.442 --> 01:00:32.565
- Max.
- I think you're being odd.

01:00:32.827 --> 01:00:36.412
Well, I'm... always odd.
It's... why you married me.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.655
And it's why I married you.

01:00:40.193 --> 01:00:41.717
Speaking of which, Hitch, uh,

01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:45.284
what exactly are your intentions
for the lovely Sara here?

01:00:45.284 --> 01:00:48.995
Wait, you know what?
Um, actually, there... there was someone.

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.334
Um, I think I met your friends
Albert and Allegra.

01:00:54.797 --> 01:00:57.020
- My friends who and who?
- Allegra Cole?

01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.814
Really?
How do you know her?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.012
- Um, I don't.
- Oh, so you know Albert?

01:01:04.593 --> 01:01:06.970
- Well, uh... knew.
- Well, he had your tickets.

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:10.935
I mean... How well do you really
know your accountant?

01:01:11.903 --> 01:01:15.353
April 15, and then
you don't see 'im again... till April 15.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.186
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:01:18.649 --> 01:01:21.608
a coquille St. Jacques
with a lemon butter reduction...

01:01:22.029 --> 01:01:23.921
- Compliments of our chef.
- Thank you.

01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:25.618
I'm sure you're really
gonna enjoy this.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.674
That's really good.

01:01:36.949 --> 01:01:38.848
I'm very impressed.

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:40.633
Why is that?

01:01:40.884 --> 01:01:46.633
Well, you know. Around these two, people usually
can't wait to, uh, name-drop and dish their friends

01:01:46.633 --> 01:01:50.404
- and you, you are being all discreet.
- Yes. It's... it's quite endearing.

01:01:50.847 --> 01:01:53.525
Actually, it is.
So, why don't we change the subject?

01:01:56.302 --> 01:01:58.829
- Whoa! Whoa. You all right?
- Oh, no, yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:04.069
So, uh, Sara tells me that, uh,
you're a consultant, Hitch.

01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:08.577
Yeah, uh, mostly marketing,
little advertising, brand management...

01:02:10.075 --> 01:02:12.383
I have... no idea what that means.

01:02:12.919 --> 01:02:15.507
No one does.
That is why I get to charge so much.

01:02:19.457 --> 01:02:21.186
Are you-are you sure
you're all right?

01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:26.558
Uh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...
Hey, is it itchy in here or is it just me?

01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:29.587
- Oh, I know what's happening.
- No, no.

01:02:30.473 --> 01:02:32.748
You think
that I-I'm in a stressful state

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.349
because I'm tryin' to make
a good impression

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:37.736
while also... dealing
with my commitment issues...

01:02:39.038 --> 01:02:41.899
tryin' to avoid
all these awkward conversations...

01:02:43.116 --> 01:02:45.980
No, I-I-I think you have food allergies.

01:02:47.658 --> 01:02:48.503
- Oh...
- Oh!

01:02:48.907 --> 01:02:50.463
- Wow.
- What?

01:02:52.613 --> 01:02:55.120
- Uh, Benadryl? Where's the Benadryl?
- Aisle 2.

01:02:55.428 --> 01:02:57.750
- Which one's Aisle 2?
- The one with the big 2 over it.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.081
Sara, I'm fine.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.768
- You sure it's in Aisle 2?
- No.

01:03:02.002 --> 01:03:03.919
Really, it is not that serious.

01:03:08.047 --> 01:03:08.652
Benadryl.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:13.344
- A lot of Benadryl. A lot. A lot of Benadryl.
- What? What? Will you...

01:03:28.394 --> 01:03:30.749
Coquille St. Jacques.
Death on a leaf!

01:03:35.568 --> 01:03:36.175
Come on!

01:03:47.594 --> 01:03:49.055
Okay, we're doing fine.

01:03:49.382 --> 01:03:52.006
Just a couple more blocks
and you get to lie down.

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.692
Wait, wait,
who-who sings that song, again?

01:04:02.692 --> 01:04:04.522
Oh, girl. Earth, Wind & Fire.

01:04:04.899 --> 01:04:06.747
Ahh, you should let them sing it.

01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:14.077
I bet this would be great on the rocks.
It's good, right?

01:04:16.501 --> 01:04:19.704
I bet I can ask you
just about anything right now.

01:04:19.704 --> 01:04:20.834
No.

01:04:21.407 --> 01:04:23.540
I'm a vault, baby.
Locked down.

01:04:25.347 --> 01:04:31.031
- What is an heiress doing with a CPA?
- Oh, they're going to the Knicks game.

01:04:31.991 --> 01:04:34.091
Yep, Fort Knox.

01:04:34.236 --> 01:04:35.208
Oh, whoa, whoa.

01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:40.433
- He loves her so much!
- I'm sure he does.

01:04:40.893 --> 01:04:44.850
I'm tellin'g you, people search
their whole lives trying to find the

01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.084
<i>reasons that we're here.</i>

01:04:49.642 --> 01:04:50.668
I wouldn't know.

01:04:51.911 --> 01:04:52.921
You would if you saw it.

01:04:52.921 --> 01:04:57.117
Well, sometimes it's really hard
to see the forest through the sleaze.

01:04:58.335 --> 01:05:00.802
What about you?
You ever been in love?

01:05:06.043 --> 01:05:07.001
Yep.

01:05:11.211 --> 01:05:13.412
But you're never gonna know that.

01:05:16.274 --> 01:05:19.973
Okay, okay, I think you've had enough
of the juice box.

01:05:22.773 --> 01:05:23.735
Let's go.

01:05:31.117 --> 01:05:32.846
This is some place.

01:05:33.945 --> 01:05:35.414
You live here alone?

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:41.919
Yeah. I actually prefer it that way.
What about you?

01:05:42.456 --> 01:05:46.388
I haven't had a roommate since college,
and he upped and married my sister.

01:05:46.388 --> 01:05:49.081
- Really?
- Yeah, they're gonna have a baby soon.

01:05:49.081 --> 01:05:51.471
Oh... Uncle Hitch.

01:05:53.146 --> 01:05:54.191
Thank you.

01:06:00.713 --> 01:06:03.648
- So, how do you feel?
- Good.

01:06:04.864 --> 01:06:06.060
Relaxed.

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.408
So, what about you?
Any siblings?

01:06:11.479 --> 01:06:15.577
Sister. Maria. Lives in D.C.

01:06:17.782 --> 01:06:18.991
Younger, right?

01:06:22.046 --> 01:06:23.660
I could hear it in your voice.

01:06:25.079 --> 01:06:28.919
Sort of an... innate protective thing.

01:06:31.044 --> 01:06:32.425
Yeah, I guess.

01:06:38.427 --> 01:06:39.469
What?

01:06:42.718 --> 01:06:44.229
She almost died once.

01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:50.398
I was 10.

01:06:57.657 --> 01:07:02.069
We, um... were skating on the pond
behind our house...

01:07:02.808 --> 01:07:04.400
and she fell through the ice.

01:07:06.711 --> 01:07:08.167
My dad pulled 'er out.

01:07:12.618 --> 01:07:14.142
Gave 'er mouth-to-mouth.

01:07:17.554 --> 01:07:20.223
Longest three minutes of my life.

01:07:21.972 --> 01:07:23.384
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:07:29.657 --> 01:07:32.315
I don't think
I've ever really gotten over it.

01:07:35.986 --> 01:07:39.503
Kind of... defines you, doesn't it?

01:07:44.412 --> 01:07:48.830
You know, like,
one moment you're gliding along...

01:07:50.296 --> 01:07:54.459
next moment you're standin' in the rain
watchin' your life fall apart.

01:07:56.529 --> 01:07:57.860
Except it was snow.

01:07:59.797 --> 01:08:02.598
Yeah. That's what I said, "snow".

01:08:04.937 --> 01:08:05.972
You said "rain".

01:08:08.065 --> 01:08:10.893
Some kind of precipitation.

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:16.819
Is that what happened to you?

01:08:21.121 --> 01:08:24.787
Nothin' as dramatic
as fallin' through the ice.

01:08:28.828 --> 01:08:29.538
You know, it, uh...

01:08:31.714 --> 01:08:33.209
definitely...

01:08:37.203 --> 01:08:38.594
Left a scar?

01:08:40.673 --> 01:08:41.798
Yeah.

01:08:54.451 --> 01:08:58.194
I guess it's best
just not to love at all, right?

01:09:02.488 --> 01:09:03.863
Or skate.

01:09:24.557 --> 01:09:25.510
Hitch?

01:09:31.725 --> 01:09:33.015
Are you here?

01:09:42.468 --> 01:09:47.506
Sara, you're such an idiot! You moron!
What the hell did you think?

01:09:47.673 --> 01:09:50.345
You're so stupid! You're so stupid!
You gotta learn, Sara.

01:09:50.345 --> 01:09:52.665
- When are you gonna learn...
- Should I come back later?

01:09:55.748 --> 01:09:58.929
Hi. I thought, uh,
I thought you left.

01:09:59.172 --> 01:10:03.883
Well, yeah, I did, you know, but, uh,
but then I came back... with breakfast.

01:10:04.928 --> 01:10:07.644
Uh, yeah, I figured
it-it was the least that I could do.

01:10:09.722 --> 01:10:11.098
Hey, I didn't know
what you were drinkin'

01:10:11.098 --> 01:10:16.356
so... I got a grande cap, a latte,
an Earl Grey tea

01:10:16.356 --> 01:10:19.733
and... somethin' with "chai" in the title.

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.702
Uh-uh... tea for me.

01:10:22.702 --> 01:10:25.736
Tea. Yes!
I was hoping you'd say that.

01:10:28.954 --> 01:10:32.088
Oh, God.
You're a morning person, aren't you?

01:10:33.161 --> 01:10:36.082
Well, you know,
like I, uh, always tell my clients:

01:10:36.417 --> 01:10:39.414
Begin each day...
as if it were on purpose.

01:10:47.259 --> 01:10:49.138
- Wow. Beautiful day.
- Yeah.

01:10:51.136 --> 01:10:53.437
- Beautiful girl...
- Thank you.

01:10:55.180 --> 01:10:59.700
- Well, I'm... this way.
- Oh, I'm... that way.

01:11:01.314 --> 01:11:03.601
Gimme a ring... sometime.

01:11:05.313 --> 01:11:06.903
I mean, on the phone.

01:11:08.991 --> 01:11:12.816
Yeah... No, uh, I definitely will.

01:11:15.209 --> 01:11:15.921
Good.

01:11:45.023 --> 01:11:47.588
Oh, I gotta go to work.

01:11:51.836 --> 01:11:52.742
Okay.

01:11:57.369 --> 01:11:58.414
Bye.

01:12:00.623 --> 01:12:01.996
Goodbye.

01:12:26.123 --> 01:12:30.163
Hey. Can you believe
what a beautiful day it is...

01:12:30.936 --> 01:12:31.823
not?

01:12:32.035 --> 01:12:35.198
- What's wrong, pumpkin?
- Oh, I'm so stupid.

01:12:35.868 --> 01:12:37.969
I ignored your advice.
I went on that date.

01:12:38.329 --> 01:12:39.872
With who?

01:12:40.479 --> 01:12:42.891
- Not the lingerie guy...
- Vance Munson.

01:12:43.182 --> 01:12:45.253
You're right, there's no way
he ever had a mother.

01:12:45.253 --> 01:12:46.881
Oh, that bad?

01:12:46.881 --> 01:12:51.141
He took me to Scalinatella,
and he was affectionate and sweet...

01:12:51.991 --> 01:12:55.225
He told me all these intimate things,
like... how he can't taste food...

01:12:55.225 --> 01:12:56.590
and he wants three kids...

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:58.231
So, you slept with 'im.

01:12:59.698 --> 01:13:01.390
I never seen anybody
get dressed that fast.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:03.349
Oh, Case, I'm so sorry.

01:13:04.479 --> 01:13:08.239
- Well, maybe I'll just die alone after all.
- No, you won't.

01:13:08.941 --> 01:13:12.824
You're gonna meet a great guy with a great smile
and you're gonna travel the world together.

01:13:12.824 --> 01:13:15.000
Okay, who are you?
What have you done with my best friend?

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.453
It is true. He just hasn't found you yet.
But he will.

01:13:18.453 --> 01:13:22.291
Just as he's leaving, guess what he says:
"Date doctor, my ass."

01:13:22.623 --> 01:13:25.429
- Well, what-what does that mean?
- It means he's really out there.

01:13:25.678 --> 01:13:29.508
And if I ever meet 'im, the only date
he's gonna need is with a real doctor.

01:13:42.193 --> 01:13:43.156
That's him.

01:13:43.909 --> 01:13:46.038
Vance? Is that you?

01:13:46.355 --> 01:13:49.318
Yeah, hey there... beautiful.

01:13:49.748 --> 01:13:51.107
Sara Melas, from the "Standard".

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.151
I'd like to talk to you about
the dating consultant you hired

01:13:53.151 --> 01:13:55.028
before you went out
with Casey Sedgewick?

01:13:59.214 --> 01:14:02.840
Hey, you don't wanna talk, that's fine.
I'm gonna write this anyway.

01:14:03.128 --> 01:14:05.502
You just earned yourself
a photo with a boldface caption.

01:14:05.502 --> 01:14:07.255
What? Nice.

01:14:07.255 --> 01:14:09.460
Now, I can only imagine how
the guys on the trading floor

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.919
are gonna react when they see this.

01:14:10.919 --> 01:14:12.816
Look, you have no proof,
you have no facts.

01:14:12.816 --> 01:14:15.596
Vance, I'm a gossip columnist,
not the D.A.

01:14:15.596 --> 01:14:18.684
Okay, okay. How much will it cost me
to stay out of this?

01:14:18.684 --> 01:14:20.571
I don't want money. I want a name.

01:14:20.946 --> 01:14:23.062
- I don't know his name.
- Well, what do you know?

01:14:26.218 --> 01:14:26.740
I know this.

01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:35.572
All this for a lousy lay.

01:14:36.562 --> 01:14:37.859
Are we satisfied?

01:14:39.287 --> 01:14:40.408
Almost.

01:14:44.636 --> 01:14:47.417
No, you... Oh... You gotta be...

01:14:53.045 --> 01:14:54.589
Is this really necessary?

01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.424
Have you seen your back?

01:14:56.424 --> 01:15:00.637
No, but I see my front and... maybe
we should be starting with some sit-ups.

01:15:01.304 --> 01:15:03.138
God! Mother of Troy!

01:15:06.683 --> 01:15:07.311
Hello?

01:15:07.811 --> 01:15:12.732
Wow. That's crazy.
Just hearin' your voice makes me smile.

01:15:13.238 --> 01:15:14.151
How are you?

01:15:14.697 --> 01:15:16.573
Uh, I'm-I'm-I'm good, I think. Um...

01:15:17.202 --> 01:15:20.571
No, actually, you know what?
Uh, it's, uh... I feel a little strange.

01:15:22.995 --> 01:15:23.914
I'm good.

01:15:25.644 --> 01:15:26.926
Sweet Georgia Brown!

01:15:26.926 --> 01:15:27.830
What was that?

01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:31.251
No, that's just, uh...
some guy screamin'.

01:15:32.618 --> 01:15:33.884
<i>Listen, is there any context</i>

01:15:33.884 --> 01:15:39.467
under which you'd consider facial edema
and pharmaceutical intervention a date?

01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:42.257
Mm... Probably not.

01:15:42.528 --> 01:15:43.356
How 'bout a do-over?

01:15:43.356 --> 01:15:46.439
- What do you have in mind?
- Dinner, my place...

01:15:46.439 --> 01:15:49.970
I mean, because obviously goin'
anywhere public with you is outta the question.

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.116
God! That's it.
I don't like you very much.

01:15:54.318 --> 01:15:55.400
What is that?

01:15:55.974 --> 01:15:56.742
Wait... I'm getting up.

01:15:56.742 --> 01:15:59.568
Kind of, uh-uh, like,
one of those makeover shows.

01:15:59.568 --> 01:16:01.943
- That's a makeover show?
- It's Danish.

01:16:02.247 --> 01:16:02.782
Almost done!

01:16:04.983 --> 01:16:05.825
Friday?

01:16:05.825 --> 01:16:11.006
Oh, can't. I told a friend I'd go speed dating.
Well, you know, for moral support.

01:16:11.006 --> 01:16:13.098
Uh, but... tomorrow I'm free.

01:16:13.996 --> 01:16:15.828
Great. All right. Uh, 8 o'clock?

01:16:16.562 --> 01:16:17.171
Great.

01:16:17.696 --> 01:16:20.383
- All right. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

01:16:25.531 --> 01:16:28.755
- See, it wa-it wasn't so bad, was it?
- Oh, God!

01:16:33.229 --> 01:16:35.904
<i>Ball is back in play
after a 20-second timeout.</i>

01:16:35.904 --> 01:16:39.777
<i>Knicks lead the Grizzlies, 12-6,
here early in the first quarter.</i>

01:16:49.787 --> 01:16:52.337
- So, this is what this feels like?
- "This" being...?

01:16:53.265 --> 01:16:55.131
Great seats... great game...

01:16:56.717 --> 01:16:58.834
Great... date.

01:17:00.843 --> 01:17:02.423
I mean... sort of.

01:17:02.889 --> 01:17:05.339
To me, it-it feels... like a...

01:17:06.048 --> 01:17:08.025
- Date?
- Yeah.

01:17:08.932 --> 01:17:09.850
Yeah.

01:17:14.064 --> 01:17:15.770
Look at 'er.
She looks so happy.

01:17:16.822 --> 01:17:18.856
How does a guy like that
end up with a girl like her?

01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:28.533
I am so jealous.
I've always wanted to be able to do that.

01:17:28.533 --> 01:17:31.546
Really? Tonight is your lucky night.
Let's see what you got.

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:33.331
Okay. You ready?

01:17:36.775 --> 01:17:39.714
- Oh, God. I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

01:17:39.714 --> 01:17:42.019
<i>Knicks off to a great start...</i>

01:17:41.879 --> 01:17:43.501
All right,
here's how it works.

01:17:43.775 --> 01:17:48.071
Central Park Zoo, tomorrow, noon,
by the sea lions.

01:17:49.488 --> 01:17:51.115
No, don't worry. I'll find you.

01:17:51.351 --> 01:17:53.687
All right. Thank you.

01:18:12.044 --> 01:18:13.698
No, it's all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:14.746 --> 01:18:15.590
Damn me. Damn me.

01:18:19.269 --> 01:18:22.059
Hey! That was it!
You got it. Do it again, do it again!

01:18:24.342 --> 01:18:25.757
Look how cute they are.

01:18:57.356 --> 01:18:58.416
Thanks.

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.228
I had a great time tonight, Albert.

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:20.939
I... had a great... time, too, Allegra.

01:19:38.623 --> 01:19:39.676
Well, uh...

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:42.768
Good night.

01:19:43.602 --> 01:19:44.933
Good night, Albert.

01:19:58.447 --> 01:20:00.727
- Allegra.
- Yes?

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.566
Hold on.

01:20:28.447 --> 01:20:30.091
I like your lips.

01:20:34.219 --> 01:20:35.849
They seem to like you, too.

01:20:42.186 --> 01:20:45.320
Okay... Good night.

01:20:46.465 --> 01:20:47.399
Good night.

01:21:23.908 --> 01:21:26.241
- Anything?
- Not yet.

01:21:26.901 --> 01:21:28.520
But I got some great shots
of you bitin' your nails.

01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:31.358
Well, it's a big story.

01:21:32.364 --> 01:21:34.496
- Aw... incoming.
- Really?

01:21:34.496 --> 01:21:35.702
Yep. They're shakin' hands.

01:21:35.702 --> 01:21:38.200
Oh, my God, this is so great.
I can't wait to nail this guy.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:40.034
Hey, make sure
you get a good shot of his face.

01:21:40.034 --> 01:21:40.469
Uh-huh.

01:21:40.469 --> 01:21:42.663
- What's he look like?
- Tall, dark, and handsome.

01:21:43.522 --> 01:21:44.472
Basic principles:

01:21:45.041 --> 01:21:47.299
No matter what, no matter who,
no matter when.

01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.876
This is killing me.

01:21:49.302 --> 01:21:51.423
Geoff's actually managing
to play it straight.

01:21:51.458 --> 01:21:52.806
How long you been
in love with 'er?

01:21:52.806 --> 01:21:56.629
Oh, her? Chap...
About two and a... two and a half years.

01:21:59.638 --> 01:22:00.098
- Take a look.
- Okay.

01:22:08.563 --> 01:22:11.667
- How'd you get my card?
- Albert... Albert Brennaman.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:13.918
- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.

01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:17.614
What...? Sara...

01:22:18.535 --> 01:22:19.199
Sara!

01:22:23.969 --> 01:22:27.415
- Pleasure to meet you, Geoff.
- Uh, hey, what...

01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:35.548
<i>- How'd you get my card?
- Albert... Albert Brennaman.</i>

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:37.799
<i>- Great guy, isn't he?
- Excellent guy.</i>

01:22:40.512 --> 01:22:42.070
You sure you wanna do this?

01:22:42.482 --> 01:22:43.354
Why wouldn't I?

01:22:47.101 --> 01:22:51.732
You know, Louise made an interesting observation
on the way home the other night.

01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:55.627
She said people who are guarded
are afraid

01:22:55.627 --> 01:22:59.030
that... you can see right through them.

01:22:59.212 --> 01:23:03.369
That's why they hide behind
layers of, uh, secrecy or humor.

01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:06.828
Well, he's gonna have to hide behind
a lot more than that once this hits the fan.

01:23:08.139 --> 01:23:09.391
She meant you.

01:23:14.401 --> 01:23:15.760
What do you want me to say?

01:23:17.313 --> 01:23:21.762
That I like the guy?
Yeah, sure, I liked the guy.

01:23:23.555 --> 01:23:26.140
Well... here's his shirt.

01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:32.065
- Why don't you think about it? Call me.
- Thanks.

01:23:42.377 --> 01:23:42.945
Yeah.

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:45.792
<i>Papi, Sara Melas is here to see you.</i>

01:23:47.328 --> 01:23:50.459
Thanks a lot, Raoul. Send her up.
And, uh, stop callin' me papi.

01:24:02.192 --> 01:24:05.472
Well... Aren't you
a sight for sore eyes.

01:24:06.822 --> 01:24:08.934
I believe this belongs to you.

01:24:13.147 --> 01:24:16.033
Yeah, this thing is like a...
a bad penny.

01:24:16.141 --> 01:24:17.288
Wow!

01:24:18.193 --> 01:24:19.899
So, this is it.

01:24:20.335 --> 01:24:21.862
Uh, yeah, this is it.

01:24:24.115 --> 01:24:28.837
- Business must be good.
- Well, you know, it-it has its rewards.

01:24:28.837 --> 01:24:32.165
Yeah.... I'll bet.

01:24:33.892 --> 01:24:34.458
Tough day?

01:24:35.212 --> 01:24:37.221
Mm, you could say that.

01:24:39.064 --> 01:24:41.418
Well, you know what?
You can just sit back and relax.

01:24:41.418 --> 01:24:43.592
- Mmm...
- I got this all covered.

01:24:47.305 --> 01:24:49.616
Spanish wine?!

01:24:51.609 --> 01:24:54.064
How thoughtful are we?

01:24:54.064 --> 01:24:56.646
- Here, let me pour that for you.
- No, that's okay.

01:24:57.849 --> 01:25:00.319
- You want some?
- Sure.

01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:08.384
So... Hitch.
Is that, like, a... noun or a verb?

01:25:09.468 --> 01:25:12.672
- Uhh... I guess it depends.
- Mmm.

01:25:14.956 --> 01:25:18.710
Let's see.
What should we toast to?

01:25:21.842 --> 01:25:25.051
Never lie, steal, cheat, or drink.

01:25:25.638 --> 01:25:29.100
But if you must lie,
lie in the arms of the one you love.

01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:32.647
If you must steal,
steal away from bad company.

01:25:33.144 --> 01:25:35.933
If you must cheat, cheat death.

01:25:36.481 --> 01:25:38.033
And if you must drink...

01:25:38.448 --> 01:25:42.079
drink in the moments...
that take your breath away.

01:25:43.959 --> 01:25:45.835
Did you just make that up?

01:25:58.276 --> 01:26:02.172
Make yourself at home.
Um... I'm gonna... check on the risotto.

01:26:02.586 --> 01:26:07.421
Waw! Look at this!
Which one's the music?

01:26:09.767 --> 01:26:12.151
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:26:13.185 --> 01:26:16.561
And it does... does lights, too?

01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:21.025
Uh, hey. Let me, uh,
let me help you out with that.

01:26:21.275 --> 01:26:24.359
Now, this... this is nifty.

01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:26.619
What are you doing?

01:26:27.285 --> 01:26:29.697
How does it work, exactly?

01:26:31.159 --> 01:26:36.158
Well, usually... you have dinner,
then you have dessert.

01:26:36.962 --> 01:26:40.588
No, no. No, I mean
your thriving business.

01:26:44.714 --> 01:26:46.007
I don't do interviews.

01:26:48.293 --> 01:26:51.595
But if you'd like to get back to the evening,
I'd be more than happy to sit and talk.

01:26:51.595 --> 01:26:53.847
Great idea. You start.

01:26:55.183 --> 01:26:59.894
Well... maybe I would
if you weren't snarling.

01:27:06.477 --> 01:27:08.028
What if I told you...

01:27:08.546 --> 01:27:13.007
that I know exactly what you do
and how you do it?

01:27:13.007 --> 01:27:15.293
And I think it's despicable!

01:27:15.293 --> 01:27:18.252
You know what?
We might need to go out to dinner.

01:27:18.252 --> 01:27:21.712
Yeah, there's a great seafood restaurant
I'd love to take you to.

01:27:24.195 --> 01:27:25.845
How 'bout
you just get a cleaver, butcher?

01:27:26.865 --> 01:27:29.342
- Maybe I will!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:27:29.678 --> 01:27:31.517
Nothing a front-page story can't cure.

01:27:31.517 --> 01:27:33.142
- Oh, so that's what this is all about?
- Uh-huh.

01:27:33.142 --> 01:27:35.682
Albert and Allegra
on the front of your crap-ass newspaper?

01:27:35.682 --> 01:27:37.727
- You put them there!
- No, you did!

01:27:37.727 --> 01:27:40.812
No, he did!
The minute he called you!

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:10.066
Dr. Hitch. Listen to me, papi.

01:28:10.465 --> 01:28:14.487
I need to bring my partner, Amir,
somewhere amazing for our anniversary.

01:28:15.013 --> 01:28:18.099
Maybe it's not your thing,
but... maybe it is.

01:28:18.383 --> 01:28:19.809
What the hell
are you talking about, Raoul?

01:28:20.059 --> 01:28:21.746
It's you, no?

01:28:42.507 --> 01:28:46.543
So, my friend? How was she?
Pretty good, eh?

01:28:50.386 --> 01:28:53.157
How was she?
I'll tell you! She was great!

01:29:07.106 --> 01:29:08.524
- Isn't that the Date Doctor?
- No, it's not him.

01:29:08.524 --> 01:29:10.955
- I'm telling you, that's him.
- He doesn't look anything like 'im.

01:29:10.955 --> 01:29:14.252
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know him?
- No.

01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:18.534
I want you to look me in the eye
and you tell me he did not hire you.

01:29:18.534 --> 01:29:22.459
Ma'am, I have never seen this man
before in my life.

01:29:22.947 --> 01:29:23.765
See you later, Tony.

01:29:23.765 --> 01:29:26.249
Uh, Tony? You have got
some serious explaining to do.

01:29:26.549 --> 01:29:28.216
Albert. Hitch. You all right?

01:29:28.216 --> 01:29:31.063
You know what? I can't really, uh,
talk right now. I'm kinda... tied up.

01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:33.459
One, two, three.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:43.227
Women will remain seated.

01:29:43.449 --> 01:29:46.899
Men will rotate
to the left at the buzzer.

01:29:46.899 --> 01:29:48.914
You get two minutes each,
four minutes total.

01:29:48.914 --> 01:29:53.336
So... trade your talk time
when you hear...

01:29:55.279 --> 01:29:55.740
the gong.

01:29:56.363 --> 01:29:58.110
If it's mutual, you get numbers.

01:29:58.325 --> 01:30:01.984
If not, better luck next time. Okay?

01:30:02.756 --> 01:30:05.453
Ladies... take your seats.

01:30:06.858 --> 01:30:10.936
Case, you are a living testimonial
to the triumph of hope over experience.

01:30:10.936 --> 01:30:12.341
Oh, thanks for comin'.

01:30:12.964 --> 01:30:15.723
I know it's lame. I'm sure
it's the last thing you feel like doin'.

01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:20.028
I really prefer Rachmaninoff
to the heavier romantic composers,

01:30:20.028 --> 01:30:23.358
but... you know, despite
the pan-Germanic anti-Semitism...

01:30:23.741 --> 01:30:26.017
I'd still have to say
my favorite is Wagner.

01:30:27.313 --> 01:30:28.231
Oh, yeah.

01:30:29.180 --> 01:30:31.240
- Nice talking to you.
- Thank you. Okay, bye.

01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:32.275
Bye.

01:30:33.035 --> 01:30:34.116
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:34.116 --> 01:30:35.288
Excuse me.

01:30:36.587 --> 01:30:37.483
That's my seat, man.

01:30:38.001 --> 01:30:39.322
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:39.532 --> 01:30:41.992
- Hi.
- My name is Ron. Uh, 28.

01:30:41.992 --> 01:30:44.003
Albert Brennaman is a good man.

01:30:44.881 --> 01:30:47.541
In fact, Albert Brennaman is a great man.

01:30:47.749 --> 01:30:50.695
I just got out of
a five-year relationship.

01:30:50.835 --> 01:30:53.003
I'm a lot of fun at parties.
I like dogs...

01:30:53.003 --> 01:30:56.340
And then... you're-you're mad at me
for what I do for a living?

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:57.674
Look, I've already got your number

01:30:57.674 --> 01:31:00.215
so why don't you go
consult your conscience?

01:31:00.778 --> 01:31:03.110
- Albert is in love with her.
- Oh yeah, just like Sebastian?

01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:05.351
- Is there a problem?
- Oh, no, just one sec.

01:31:05.351 --> 01:31:07.769
- What do you have against Allegra anyway?
- Nothing.

01:31:08.268 --> 01:31:11.235
My interest is protecting women
from assholes like you.

01:31:11.235 --> 01:31:12.980
Oh, I did ice climbing. Once.

01:31:12.980 --> 01:31:15.657
- You don't even know me.
- And whose fault is that?

01:31:15.657 --> 01:31:18.484
... the sun comes up,
the-the ice really starts to fall apart.

01:31:18.484 --> 01:31:19.864
I bet. I-I-I'm sorry.

01:31:19.864 --> 01:31:21.998
- Do you know this guy?
- Apparently not.

01:31:21.998 --> 01:31:22.877
You're in my seat.

01:31:22.877 --> 01:31:26.789
Look... You really...
I'm doin' you a favor, believe me.

01:31:27.591 --> 01:31:31.628
Basically, I like outdoor sports.
But indoor, uh, sports have their place, too.

01:31:31.628 --> 01:31:34.626
There are certain aspects of my job
that are secretive, all right?

01:31:34.626 --> 01:31:36.840
And my job is
to try to find the truth.

01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:40.592
The truth? Ha! You wouldn't know the truth
if it kicked you in the head.

01:31:40.592 --> 01:31:43.013
And if Albert Brennaman has
to take a fall for it, so be it.

01:31:43.013 --> 01:31:44.890
Why don't you say
what's really pissin' you off?

01:31:45.519 --> 01:31:46.641
Okay, buddy,
I've been waiting to talk to her...

01:31:46.641 --> 01:31:49.065
You wanna sit down?
Here you go, here you go. Gong!

01:31:49.065 --> 01:31:49.735
Thank you.

01:31:49.735 --> 01:31:50.622
- Excuse me.
- Whoa!

01:31:50.894 --> 01:31:53.855
Hi. A-actually, you're not supposed
to move. He's... b... um...

01:31:54.066 --> 01:31:54.981
I'm Alex Hitchens.

01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:57.037
- Okay, hi.
- No, no, it's okay, really. Go.

01:31:57.037 --> 01:31:58.947
- I'm Casey.
- Hi, Casey.

01:31:58.947 --> 01:32:01.574
And I work for a small publishing house
in the press department...

01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:04.706
which isn't actually where I wanna be.
But, you know, it's a good house, so...

01:32:04.706 --> 01:32:07.552
You handled me.
You manipulated me.

01:32:08.012 --> 01:32:11.204
You researched me and you showed me
my great-grandfather's signature.

01:32:11.372 --> 01:32:13.392
Wait. You're Ellis Island?

01:32:14.018 --> 01:32:15.562
- I thought that was real sweet.
- Thank you.

01:32:15.562 --> 01:32:19.084
- Case, you're not helping.
- Uh, excuse me! I'm on a date.

01:32:20.359 --> 01:32:23.020
Does it ever occur to women
that maybe a guy might

01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.639
like to have a plan, you know,
because he's nervous?

01:32:25.639 --> 01:32:29.692
He's not sure that he could just...
walk up to you and you'd respond if he said:

01:32:29.976 --> 01:32:33.230
"I like you." "I... like you."

01:32:34.032 --> 01:32:35.566
I... like you!

01:32:35.566 --> 01:32:38.656
- Oh, no, that sounds good to me.
- It's true, you can't tell 'em you that you like 'em.

01:32:38.656 --> 01:32:41.788
- I tried that one time. It didn't go well.
- It's stupid, I've been crashed and burned on that.

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.199
That is what you did,
and I did like you!

01:32:45.449 --> 01:32:48.126
I just didn't know I was being worked over
by some professional.

01:32:48.292 --> 01:32:49.343
He doesn't have a badge.

01:32:50.455 --> 01:32:52.705
And, you know, the only time
he was sincere or spontaneous

01:32:52.705 --> 01:32:56.055
was when everything was going horribly wrong...
or when you were stoned outta your head.

01:32:56.055 --> 01:32:59.671
- Now, I'm sorry to interrupt. Do I know you?
- No, I-I don't think so.

01:32:59.671 --> 01:33:02.399
- You wanna see me be spontaneous?
- Sure, you want a Benadryl?

01:33:02.399 --> 01:33:07.137
Hey, you know what? This is really kinda
distracting. And I haven't gotten laid in a year!

01:33:13.816 --> 01:33:16.479
We're sorry. Why-why don't you guys
get back to your date?

01:33:16.978 --> 01:33:19.820
Um... Or... go somewhere.

01:33:20.943 --> 01:33:22.418
Maybe from the bank? Huh?

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.738
Hey, you know what?
If this doesn't work out, you can give 'im a call.

01:33:24.738 --> 01:33:26.282
He might hook you up
with Paris Hilton.

01:33:26.282 --> 01:33:30.116
Wait, that's it. That's... You're the, uh,
you're the Date Doctor, right?

01:33:30.537 --> 01:33:32.254
Oh, you're the Date Doctor?

01:33:34.587 --> 01:33:37.556
- You're the Date Doctor?
- Do we have a problem here?

01:33:37.794 --> 01:33:42.172
Oh, yeah. A big one!
What the hell did I ever do to you, huh?

01:33:43.056 --> 01:33:45.425
I'm s... Am I missing something?

01:33:46.185 --> 01:33:47.303
Sir, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

01:33:47.469 --> 01:33:48.262
All right.

01:33:48.442 --> 01:33:51.182
Why don't you go hit a titty bar
with your buddy Vance?

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:57.934
Wow.

01:34:00.258 --> 01:34:00.899
I don't believe this.

01:34:05.096 --> 01:34:05.697
That's your source?

01:34:07.128 --> 01:34:10.742
- You buried yourself, Alex.
- Then you weren't listening.

01:34:11.037 --> 01:34:15.374
I heard every word.
You're a scam artist.

01:34:15.450 --> 01:34:18.967
- You trick women into getting...
- Into getting outta their own way

01:34:18.967 --> 01:34:22.913
so great guys like Albert Brennaman
have a fighting chance.

01:34:23.047 --> 01:34:26.148
Okay, no, no, no. I want-I want everybody
to take a good look at this... right now.

01:34:26.148 --> 01:34:27.760
Because this... this right here...

01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.337
this is exactly why fallin' in love
is so goddamn hard.

01:34:33.445 --> 01:34:35.602
Sir, let's go. Now!

01:34:38.362 --> 01:34:43.435
And Vance Munson... is a pig!
And I refused to work with him.

01:34:43.989 --> 01:34:45.834
You need to get your facts right.

01:34:48.339 --> 01:34:51.242
It's because o' jerks like him
that I even have a job.

01:34:54.288 --> 01:34:55.498
Had a job.

01:35:08.429 --> 01:35:10.092
Can you believe that guy?

01:35:11.094 --> 01:35:14.055
Actually... I do.

01:35:35.139 --> 01:35:35.961
<i>You...</i>

01:35:38.289 --> 01:35:40.000
<i>complete me.</i>

01:35:41.625 --> 01:35:43.685
<i>- I might just have...
- Shut up.</i>

01:35:44.729 --> 01:35:46.135
<i>Just shut up.</i>

01:35:47.164 --> 01:35:49.260
<i>You had me at "hello".</i>

01:36:17.328 --> 01:36:18.220
No comment.

01:36:19.332 --> 01:36:27.130
Oh, yeah... You know, uh...
This is... off the... record.

01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:34.223
I came to apologize.

01:36:34.545 --> 01:36:39.768
I made some assumptions about you
based on... nothing, it turns out.

01:36:40.353 --> 01:36:45.736
- And I, uh... I guess Casey's right. My best friend...
- Don't worry about it. We're straight.

01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:51.739
Wait... I just I... I should've asked you.
You know? But sometimes you're so guarded.

01:36:51.739 --> 01:36:54.465
And I just don't wanna
be another reason for you to...

01:36:56.366 --> 01:37:00.419
I'm not someone... who likes
to get involved past a certain point.

01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:04.546
And that point...
was about a week ago.

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:15.140
Well... I just wanna say
I'm really sorry...

01:37:16.598 --> 01:37:18.545
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:37:21.125 --> 01:37:21.649
You didn't.

01:37:26.457 --> 01:37:27.690
That's a relief.

01:37:56.799 --> 01:37:59.345
- Hey, fella.
- Yeah, good. You?

01:38:02.302 --> 01:38:04.055
- What you got there?
- This?

01:38:04.055 --> 01:38:08.124
I... figured maybe if my heart
stops beatin', it wouldn't hurt so much.

01:38:09.772 --> 01:38:11.277
She hasn't called back?

01:38:15.529 --> 01:38:17.073
Hey, you want some coffee?

01:38:22.322 --> 01:38:23.706
I want you to fix it.

01:38:28.209 --> 01:38:29.595
I got nothin', Albert.

01:38:31.547 --> 01:38:33.881
Hey, you-you wanna do somethin'?
We should get out tonight.

01:38:33.921 --> 01:38:37.142
You know, honestly? Never knew
I could feel like this, um?

01:38:37.142 --> 01:38:40.095
I swear I'm...
goin' out of my mind.

01:38:41.282 --> 01:38:43.264
I wanna throw myself off
of every building in New York.

01:38:43.264 --> 01:38:48.321
I-I see a cab and I just wanna dive in front of it,
because... then I'll stop thinkin' about 'er.

01:38:48.321 --> 01:38:51.144
Look, you will.
Just... give it time.

01:38:51.144 --> 01:38:53.814
That's just it. I don't want to.

01:38:54.072 --> 01:38:56.949
I mean, I've... waited my whole life
to feel this miserable.

01:38:57.169 --> 01:38:59.325
And if this is the only way
I can stay connected with her,

01:38:59.325 --> 01:39:01.593
then... then this is
who I have to be.

01:39:01.825 --> 01:39:06.121
No, you don't.
You can change, you can adapt.

01:39:06.548 --> 01:39:09.166
You can make it,
so you don't ever have to feel like this.

01:39:09.166 --> 01:39:10.580
Ever again.

01:39:20.564 --> 01:39:23.501
Oh, my God.
You just don't get it, do you?

01:39:24.101 --> 01:39:25.153
Oh, I get it.

01:39:26.271 --> 01:39:27.734
All right, it's-it's...
Let me get this straight.

01:39:28.397 --> 01:39:31.357
You're sellin' this stuff,
but you just don't believe in your own product.

01:39:32.027 --> 01:39:35.076
- Love is my life.
- No. Love is your job.

01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:46.886
Hey!

01:39:48.623 --> 01:39:51.128
You wanna jump out a plane
without a chute, be my guest.

01:39:51.128 --> 01:39:53.603
But forgive me if I don't join you.

01:39:54.506 --> 01:39:56.720
This isn't about love
for you at all, is it?

01:39:58.644 --> 01:40:02.487
Yeah... This whole time,
I thought I was the coward.

01:40:07.642 --> 01:40:09.830
- Where you going?
- Skydiving.

01:40:35.671 --> 01:40:37.296
Allegra! Allegra!

01:40:37.933 --> 01:40:39.686
Allegra!! Allegra!

01:40:40.719 --> 01:40:42.088
Taxi! Taxi!

01:40:43.021 --> 01:40:45.978
Allegra! Allegra!!

01:40:47.274 --> 01:40:49.517
Taxi! Taxi!!

01:41:15.716 --> 01:41:17.010
Mr. Hitchens.

01:41:18.129 --> 01:41:19.996
Miss Cole,
thank you very, very much for seeing me.

01:41:20.468 --> 01:41:22.465
You said
it was a matter of life and death.

01:41:24.045 --> 01:41:27.476
That man would've sold his soul
to make you happy.

01:41:28.105 --> 01:41:30.516
So, what does that make you,
the devil?

01:41:32.853 --> 01:41:37.606
My job is not to deceive, Miss Cole.
It's to create... opportunities.

01:41:39.147 --> 01:41:40.358
Like the boardroom.

01:41:41.039 --> 01:41:42.667
- Would you have noticed him otherwise?
- Yes.

01:41:42.989 --> 01:41:45.325
- Really?
- Eventually.

01:41:50.001 --> 01:41:50.947
Maybe.

01:41:54.838 --> 01:41:57.173
How did you know
all that stuff about me?

01:41:59.712 --> 01:42:01.471
Well, you really did your homework.

01:42:03.424 --> 01:42:07.266
Like at boarding school, when everyone
used to tease me cause I couldn't whistle?

01:42:07.769 --> 01:42:11.191
And having him dance like a buffoon
knowing that I can't dance, either?

01:42:11.739 --> 01:42:15.856
Then telling him to drop mustard
on his shirt, so I'd feel less like a dork?

01:42:19.279 --> 01:42:24.661
- That was all you, right?
- No. Hell, no.

01:42:24.696 --> 01:42:28.714
- That was him?
- That's got Albert written all over it.

01:42:30.238 --> 01:42:32.254
Did you put 'im up
to the inhaler?

01:42:32.540 --> 01:42:35.174
Stop it.
He did not show you that.

01:42:36.289 --> 01:42:38.054
He chucked it
right before he kissed me.

01:42:39.042 --> 01:42:43.466
So-so, wait... that...
that... stuff worked for you?

01:42:45.185 --> 01:42:46.717
It was adorable.

01:42:54.479 --> 01:42:56.056
What did you do?

01:42:58.063 --> 01:42:58.979
Nothin'.

01:43:04.485 --> 01:43:06.827
Absolutely nothin'.

01:43:08.939 --> 01:43:09.881
That's good.

01:43:11.743 --> 01:43:14.209
- So, this was your plan the whole time, huh?
- Hey, Albert.

01:43:14.209 --> 01:43:16.331
You sail off into the sunset
with my girl?

01:43:16.332 --> 01:43:17.285
Albert!

01:43:17.584 --> 01:43:18.469
Albert!

01:43:20.414 --> 01:43:20.920
Albert!

01:43:21.503 --> 01:43:23.670
- You were like a brother to me!
- Albert!

01:43:26.295 --> 01:43:29.129
- He came here for you.
- Who?

01:43:29.129 --> 01:43:30.595
The guy you're chokin'.

01:43:41.036 --> 01:43:43.941
- My God... I love-I love you.
- I love you.

01:43:43.941 --> 01:43:47.035
No, I-I.. I really love you.
I... love you.

01:43:50.242 --> 01:43:52.619
- I love you more.
- Oh, no, I love you more. I really do.

01:43:52.868 --> 01:43:57.873
Hey, uh... I got somewhere I gotta go.
So, um...

01:44:28.486 --> 01:44:30.905
- Yeah, who is it?
- Hitch.

01:44:31.251 --> 01:44:33.374
Uh... Can I talk to you?

01:44:41.803 --> 01:44:42.589
What?

01:44:42.835 --> 01:44:46.504
Uh... Hey, you almost hit me.

01:44:51.096 --> 01:44:55.888
Look, I just, uh...
I wanted to stop by... basically. Um...

01:44:56.982 --> 01:44:58.229
See, this is the thing.

01:44:58.823 --> 01:45:07.442
I, um... This is... weird.
I don't have me behind the door, you know.

01:45:08.785 --> 01:45:09.450
Close your mouth.

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.976
Yeah, because I.... I knew
at some point I-I'd be...

01:45:18.202 --> 01:45:23.252
you know... right-right here. You know...
But I-I thought that... you know...

01:45:27.077 --> 01:45:29.265
everything would come out, you know,
but it's... you know, it's like...

01:45:31.348 --> 01:45:32.800
That's throwin' me off.

01:45:38.199 --> 01:45:40.480
- Can we close the door?
- What?

01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:44.015
I'm sorry. Just... ju... can we...
I just need, I need...

01:45:44.356 --> 01:45:46.986
- Are you serious?
- No, just... like this-this.

01:45:51.244 --> 01:45:53.115
What do you want, Hitch?

01:45:55.207 --> 01:45:56.047
You.

01:45:59.255 --> 01:46:03.256
For-for... a whole lotta reasons
that don't make any sense to me.

01:46:04.681 --> 01:46:07.625
I mean... What,
we've been on... three dates?

01:46:07.789 --> 01:46:10.552
But, that's... See, that's what's crazy.

01:46:10.552 --> 01:46:13.591
That's what's crazy,
because I know.

01:46:13.591 --> 01:46:15.008
I know deep...

01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:20.155
like just... down, just... in this area...

01:46:20.848 --> 01:46:23.058
that... I just know...

01:46:24.393 --> 01:46:25.394
that I want...

01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:33.455
I wanna be... miserable.
Like... really miserable.

01:46:34.528 --> 01:46:35.361
Cause, hey...

01:46:35.533 --> 01:46:40.116
if that's what it takes...
for me to be happy... then...

01:46:42.458 --> 01:46:44.023
Wait, that didn't come out right.
That...

01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:46.337
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:46:46.552 --> 01:46:49.924
- Nothing!
- No. No, no, not, no, not you.

01:46:51.218 --> 01:46:53.171
I'm-I'm talkin' to me.

01:47:14.406 --> 01:47:16.200
Alex Hitchens, Tom Reda.

01:47:16.484 --> 01:47:17.295
Hey.

01:47:20.841 --> 01:47:22.331
I'll just put this in the car.

01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:38.301
Maybe it's like what you said.

01:47:38.469 --> 01:47:42.596
We should just both go our separate ways
and then we'll do just fine.

01:47:54.316 --> 01:47:56.371
What if fine isn't good enough?

01:48:01.325 --> 01:48:03.247
What if I want extraordinary?

01:48:04.247 --> 01:48:05.537
No such thing.

01:48:17.967 --> 01:48:20.267
I'm just as scared as you are, Sara.

01:48:20.765 --> 01:48:24.224
But I'm right here,
and our time is right now.

01:48:24.274 --> 01:48:25.942
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about before?

01:48:25.942 --> 01:48:29.143
Sara, I am a guy. Since when
do we get anything right the first time?

01:48:29.143 --> 01:48:32.064
Well, I'm a realist,
and I know what love does to people.

01:48:32.361 --> 01:48:34.022
- No, you don't.
- Keys.

01:48:34.732 --> 01:48:35.274
Keys.

01:48:36.193 --> 01:48:38.656
There you go. Right here.

01:48:41.863 --> 01:48:44.707
I don't know who this is...
and I don't care.

01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:49.913
What I do know... is he'll never...
feel about you the way that I do.

01:48:52.097 --> 01:48:54.792
- You know how to drive a stick?
- Both o' you, shut up!

01:49:02.086 --> 01:49:04.395
- You okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:49:05.298 --> 01:49:07.944
You'll never be fine,
and neither will I!

01:49:10.935 --> 01:49:12.281
Maybe I should drive.

01:49:13.353 --> 01:49:15.373
Are you trying
to get yourself killed?

01:49:16.006 --> 01:49:16.777
If that's what it takes.

01:49:17.026 --> 01:49:18.166
Sara, what happened?

01:49:18.166 --> 01:49:21.030
- He jumped on the car.
- Why?

01:49:22.029 --> 01:49:23.538
Because that's what people do.

01:49:24.528 --> 01:49:28.161
They leap... and hope to God
they can fly.

01:49:33.792 --> 01:49:35.007
Cause otherwise...

01:49:36.089 --> 01:49:38.603
we just... drop like a rock...

01:49:39.219 --> 01:49:41.298
wondering the whole way down:

01:49:42.051 --> 01:49:45.850
"Why in the hell did I jump?"

01:49:47.428 --> 01:49:51.062
But here I am, Sara. Fallin'.

01:49:52.102 --> 01:49:56.285
And there's only one person...
that makes me feel like I can fly.

01:49:58.650 --> 01:49:59.612
That's you.

01:50:04.988 --> 01:50:07.726
So... you kinda like me, huh?

01:50:08.914 --> 01:50:09.659
Nah.

01:50:11.091 --> 01:50:12.179
I love you.

01:50:13.584 --> 01:50:16.127
I love you,
and I knew it from the first...

01:50:26.876 --> 01:50:29.346
If I say it back now,
it'll sound so stupid.

01:50:30.099 --> 01:50:30.863
Sara!

01:50:32.196 --> 01:50:36.492
Maria, this is the guy I was telling you about.
Hitch... Hitch, that's my sister... Maria.

01:50:36.645 --> 01:50:38.521
And that's her husband, Tom.

01:50:39.981 --> 01:50:40.610
Hey.

01:50:43.393 --> 01:50:44.118
Her husband.

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:29.610
- Where's your date?
- Oh, don't have one.

01:51:35.879 --> 01:51:37.248
I know. Shocking, huh?

01:51:40.749 --> 01:51:43.599
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:51:50.637 --> 01:51:51.595
Are you all right?

01:51:53.347 --> 01:51:54.657
Grandma, what happened?

01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:59.035
This young lady just saved my life.

01:52:03.498 --> 01:52:05.448
Ask her to dance.

01:52:05.696 --> 01:52:09.157
Oh... Well... if you insist.

01:52:10.125 --> 01:52:13.332
- I'm Casey.
- Charles Wellington.

01:52:14.494 --> 01:52:17.575
- Oh, and this...
- Oh, forget it. Just go.

01:52:30.925 --> 01:52:32.469
Basic principles:

01:52:34.114 --> 01:52:35.430
There are none.
