WEBVTT

00:13.221 --> 00:16.224
<i>With a sudden demonstration</i>
<i>and the appearance of Jung Jinsu,</i>

00:16.307 --> 00:19.394
<i>the revival has descended</i>
<i>into total chaos.</i>

00:19.477 --> 00:23.356
<i>The authorities are fully committed</i>
<i>to addressing the current situation,</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:26.776
<i>but signs indicate that the disruption</i>
<i>is spreading nationwide.</i>

00:26.860 --> 00:31.031
<i>Meanwhile, Chairman Jung Jinsu appeared</i>
<i>on the Arrowhead's online broadcast,</i>

00:31.114 --> 00:33.408
<i>criticizing the current practices</i>
<i>of the New Truth</i>

00:33.491 --> 00:36.453
<i>and demanding to meet</i>
<i>with Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.</i>

00:36.953 --> 00:40.040
<i>The Arrowhead livestreamed</i>
<i>a group assault on Chairman Kim,</i>

00:40.123 --> 00:43.668
<i>whose status remains unknown.</i>

00:43.752 --> 00:46.337
<i>We have just received breaking news.</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:50.008
<i>The Arrowhead has resumed</i>
<i>their live broadcast.</i>

00:50.091 --> 00:53.970
<i>They're displaying a restrained man,</i>
<i>seemingly in his fifties,</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.347
<i>and urging viewers</i>
<i>to report information about him.</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.433
<i>Here is the footage.</i>

00:59.184 --> 01:01.561
<i>Take a good look at this man!</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.981
<i>We need your help with information.</i>

01:05.607 --> 01:08.234
This man is a member of the infidel Sodo.

01:08.735 --> 01:12.113
He snuck in here
to kidnap the Resurrected One.

01:12.197 --> 01:16.743
He's also a sinner who will be subjected
to a demonstration soon.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.705
This is his cell phone.
Do you see the timer?

01:21.289 --> 01:24.084
The Sodo people
have kidnapped the Resurrected One.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.003
They're hiding
somewhere in this building right now.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.800
This man planned to use his demonstration,
scheduled in 25 minutes, as a distraction

01:31.883 --> 01:34.135
to help them escape the building.

01:34.886 --> 01:37.013
It has become evident

01:37.097 --> 01:39.682
that Sodo was also behind
the earlier demonstration!

01:41.267 --> 01:44.395
The decrees and demonstrations
are God's divine intervention,

01:44.479 --> 01:49.067
yet these devils have the audacity
to use them for their own gain!

01:49.943 --> 01:54.197
We will broadcast
this sinner's demonstration shortly.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.865
SENIOR SECRETARY LEE SUGYEONG

01:55.949 --> 01:58.910
This man will not get a single chance

01:58.993 --> 02:01.788
to repent and atone for his sins.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.708
And we will not join his demonstration!

02:06.459 --> 02:10.338
The Arrowhead!

02:34.237 --> 02:37.073
HELLBOUND SEASON 2

02:38.449 --> 02:40.618
<i>At the New Truth's announcement</i>
<i>of the New Will,</i>

02:40.702 --> 02:43.538
<i>executors suddenly appeared</i>
<i>and performed a demonstration.</i>

02:43.621 --> 02:46.916
<i>Meanwhile, a large group of people,</i>
<i>seemingly from the Arrowhead,</i>

02:47.000 --> 02:49.836
<i>is trying to break into</i>
<i>the New Truth's main building.</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:55.717
How are you feeling?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.053
I'm all right.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.142
Are my children

03:05.518 --> 03:06.853
doing well?

03:07.854 --> 03:09.981
Yes, they're doing well.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.318
I'll take you to them
once we're out of here.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.403
Don't worry.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.865
Mr. Jeong was taken by the Arrowhead.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.160
What's happening outside?

03:23.953 --> 03:26.080
A complete mess. It's turning into a riot.

03:29.542 --> 03:31.961
Then we should get to the van quickly.

03:32.045 --> 03:32.962
Let's go.

03:33.046 --> 03:33.880
Hang on.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.508
Let me talk
to our intelligence team first.

03:55.026 --> 03:58.571
WE'RE TAKING PARK JUNGJA
AND PROCEEDING WITH OUR INITIAL PLAN

04:07.455 --> 04:09.249
CULT LEADER
HELLO, MS. LEE SUGYEONG…

04:12.669 --> 04:15.088
HELLO, MS. LEE SUGYEONG
THIS IS JUNG JINSU

04:23.930 --> 04:25.765
TODAY'S EVENT MUST BE YOUR WORK

04:29.394 --> 04:32.105
THAT MEANS YOU WERE ALSO BEHIND
SODO KIDNAPPING PARK JUNGJA

04:57.839 --> 04:59.257
<i>Hello, Senior Secretary Lee.</i>

05:02.218 --> 05:03.219
Mr. Jung Jinsu?

05:08.057 --> 05:09.684
What do your messages mean?

05:10.184 --> 05:12.312
<i>Maybe it was the best option</i>
<i>for the government.</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:17.108
After all, you must have total control
over two conflicting ideas

05:17.692 --> 05:19.319
to control this society.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.160
And you chose the New Truth and Sodo.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.999
<i>Your goal with this revival</i>
<i>wasn't to unite everyone</i>

05:33.541 --> 05:36.836
but to split everyone
into just two groups, wasn't it?

05:38.504 --> 05:40.548
No need to play innocent.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.009
I understand your intentions
better than anyone.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.346
You're a clever man.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.767
So…

05:53.394 --> 05:54.604
what do you want?

05:54.687 --> 05:56.314
<i>I'd like you to tell me.</i>

05:57.482 --> 05:58.483
I want

05:59.609 --> 06:01.361
to meet Park Jungja.

06:04.947 --> 06:05.865
Park Jungja.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.202
What are you going to do with her?

06:09.285 --> 06:10.370
<i>Nothing, really.</i>

06:12.246 --> 06:13.998
I just need to speak to her privately.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.711
As you know, she's the only one
who's experienced what I have.

06:19.337 --> 06:21.589
<i>But Sodo has taken Park Jungja,</i>

06:22.507 --> 06:24.801
and these fanatics are not very reliable.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.178
So…

06:29.597 --> 06:32.600
I'd like you to bring Park Jungja to me.

06:32.683 --> 06:33.518
I'm…

06:36.229 --> 06:38.272
in a bit of a hurry.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.569
I see. You're in a hurry. Right.

06:44.529 --> 06:45.363
All right.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.658
So you meet her, and then what?

06:48.741 --> 06:51.702
<i>After I meet her,</i>
<i>I'll do whatever you want.</i>

06:52.495 --> 06:54.414
If you want her back, I'll give her back.

06:54.497 --> 06:57.041
If you want my help in fooling the world,
you've got it.

06:57.542 --> 06:58.918
<i>I'm not sure if you know,</i>

06:59.794 --> 07:02.588
but one word from me right now

07:03.756 --> 07:05.550
could have Park Jungja killed.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.306
Is that right?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.687
Then let me put it this way.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.023
Just a single word from me

07:22.066 --> 07:26.904
could turn these crazy Arrowhead fanatics
into obedient sheep for you

07:28.030 --> 07:29.740
<i>or do the exact opposite.</i>

07:33.077 --> 07:37.415
I'm sure all of you listening to this
are smart people.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.961
Why don't you all discuss this?
I'll give you five minutes.

07:43.004 --> 07:43.963
Bye for now.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.862
Prof. Hong.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.282
Could I have a cigarette?

08:40.978 --> 08:43.648
GET MOVING ONCE HIS DEMONSTRATION BEGINS

08:46.067 --> 08:48.402
The Arrowhead will broadcast
the demonstration soon,

08:48.986 --> 08:52.782
so everyone will likely be too busy
watching the broadcast.

08:52.865 --> 08:56.285
That's when we should head
to the parking lot and make our escape.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.634
We've received a tip about the sinner!

09:12.134 --> 09:14.011
His name is Jeong Hyeoksang,

09:14.512 --> 09:15.680
<i>52 years old.</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:20.226
<i>He teaches ethics</i>
<i>at Seongun Middle School.</i>

09:20.309 --> 09:22.186
<i>He teaches ethics!</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:26.065
<i>His wife is Bae Myeongsuk, 38 years old.</i>

09:27.316 --> 09:30.736
<i>His daughter, Jeong Minhui, is 18</i>
<i>and attends Seongun Girls' High School.</i>

09:31.237 --> 09:33.531
<i>His son, Jeong Minu, is 15…</i>

09:33.614 --> 09:35.658
We've already hidden his family.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.746
<i>He is an ethics teacher,</i>
<i>yet he failed to lead students</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:42.748
onto the right path
according to God's will.

09:42.832 --> 09:47.920
Instead, he imposed outdated human ethics
tainted by unrighteous customs.

09:48.004 --> 09:48.838
No.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.172
However,

09:51.465 --> 09:52.883
regardless of his past sins,

09:53.384 --> 09:56.304
nothing compares to the sins
he committed after the decree.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.974
The sin of rejecting
God's offer of repentance

10:00.057 --> 10:04.812
and reducing His divine intervention
to a tool for an infidel terrorist group.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.606
No.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.774
For a human who can make such choices,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.235
Hell is an inevitable consequence.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.571
Go to Hell!

10:13.654 --> 10:17.158
It is the path
you have chosen for yourself!

10:22.705 --> 10:24.457
Ten! Nine!

10:25.249 --> 10:26.459
- Eight!
- I'm not a sinner.

10:26.542 --> 10:27.418
Seven!

10:27.501 --> 10:30.004
- Six! Five!
- This isn't how it's supposed to be.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.382
Four! Three! Two!

10:33.466 --> 10:34.467
One!

10:41.265 --> 10:42.099
Let's move.

10:43.517 --> 10:44.352
Come on.

11:21.013 --> 11:21.847
Let's go.

12:00.094 --> 12:00.928
This way!

12:37.757 --> 12:39.425
Let go of me, you bastards!

12:41.552 --> 12:42.803
- No!
- It's a gun!

12:42.887 --> 12:43.721
Hey!

12:44.388 --> 12:45.598
Stay still, asshole!

12:54.523 --> 12:57.943
<i>We've captured the remnants of Sodo!</i>

13:01.989 --> 13:05.284
<i>Man, we finally caught</i>
<i>these goddamn pests.</i>

13:05.951 --> 13:06.827
Let's see.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.080
Well, I don't know who this bastard is.

13:12.041 --> 13:12.958
Min Hyejin!

13:14.168 --> 13:16.879
The leader of the infidels!
The devil's pawn!

13:18.255 --> 13:20.925
Damn, look at this bitch
shooting daggers at me.

13:21.675 --> 13:22.718
Unfortunately,

13:24.136 --> 13:27.765
you're not the one in the spotlight,
so we'll come back to you later.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.770
Park Jungja, the Resurrected One.

13:33.771 --> 13:36.774
She was about to be used
by Kim Jeongchil and Min Hyejin,

13:36.857 --> 13:40.444
but we have successfully rescued her!

13:42.279 --> 13:44.114
And now here he comes!

13:44.198 --> 13:48.786
The man who ventured to the ends
of the earth in search of God's message!

13:48.869 --> 13:54.500
He now stands before the Resurrected One,
who is herself God's final message!

13:59.129 --> 14:02.132
Jung Jinsu! Let Park Jungja go!

14:09.306 --> 14:10.266
Let her go.

14:11.433 --> 14:12.268
Sorry?

14:13.394 --> 14:14.395
Why?

14:17.898 --> 14:19.817
I said let her go!

14:31.745 --> 14:33.163
Ms. Park Jungja!

14:33.747 --> 14:36.500
Please, I have something to ask you.
Ms. Park Jungja!

14:36.584 --> 14:38.460
Please look at me. Look at me!

14:41.630 --> 14:42.715
I'm just like you.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.593
I've also been resurrected.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.304
I need to ask you something.

14:49.972 --> 14:50.806
Do you

14:52.516 --> 14:53.809
also see the executors?

14:55.811 --> 14:57.146
When you look in the mirror,

14:58.731 --> 15:00.316
you see them coming at you, right?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.234
What are you talking about?

15:02.318 --> 15:03.152
Why…

15:04.695 --> 15:05.571
why are you…

15:06.530 --> 15:08.324
why are you acting like you don't know?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.285
I told you. I'm just like you.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.788
I've been resurrected too.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.000
I also went through
all those different worlds.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.296
They ripped us apart again and again.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.298
Look at me.

15:24.381 --> 15:27.885
Do you… do you know who you are?
You don't, do you?

15:27.968 --> 15:30.262
You are confused, too, aren't you?

15:30.346 --> 15:31.430
I do know!

15:34.433 --> 15:35.601
I know who I am.

15:38.896 --> 15:39.980
I am…

15:41.941 --> 15:43.108
Eunyul…

15:44.985 --> 15:46.236
and Hayul's…

15:48.405 --> 15:49.698
mother.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.744
Even in all those different worlds,

15:54.662 --> 15:55.955
I was always

15:57.373 --> 15:58.958
their mother.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.838
What are you talking about?

16:06.882 --> 16:08.592
How can you be sure?

16:10.260 --> 16:12.388
How can you be so certain?

16:16.558 --> 16:18.143
Perhaps your Hell

16:19.728 --> 16:20.813
and mine…

16:23.691 --> 16:24.525
were different.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.569
What?

16:31.073 --> 16:33.409
You must be the only one
who sees those executors.

16:37.496 --> 16:38.831
When I look in the mirror,

16:39.790 --> 16:42.126
I don't see anything behind me.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.714
And those executors are not behind you.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.883
They're within you.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.594
I don't believe it.

16:53.804 --> 16:56.306
Now I can clearly see…

16:59.685 --> 17:01.603
why you were chosen for that.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.525
It's because…

17:12.906 --> 17:15.117
you were a coward.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.834
You're lying.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.340
You're lying to me.

17:32.426 --> 17:33.677
Stop lying.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.557
Stop lying.

17:40.517 --> 17:41.560
Look.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.520
Look closely in the mirror.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.022
Don't you see the executor?

17:46.982 --> 17:48.692
It's walking toward me.

18:24.061 --> 18:25.187
It's gone.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.113
It's gone.

19:05.978 --> 19:06.812
What's going on?

19:50.480 --> 19:51.899
Chairman Jung!

19:59.364 --> 20:00.199
Are you okay, sir?

20:10.083 --> 20:10.918
<i>Sir!</i>

20:11.627 --> 20:12.628
What the hell?

21:17.609 --> 21:18.443
Are you okay?

21:23.615 --> 21:24.449
Let's go!

21:47.889 --> 21:48.724
Please.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.560
Please help me.

23:42.295 --> 23:45.340
LIVE BROADCAST HAS ENDED

23:52.389 --> 23:54.141
How are people responding?

23:57.060 --> 23:58.437
How are they reacting?

23:58.520 --> 23:59.521
Well,

24:00.897 --> 24:02.899
they're not showing any reaction.

24:03.733 --> 24:07.487
It's just like the first broadcast
of the demonstration eight years ago.

24:11.616 --> 24:16.830
The riot's died down,
most people seem demotivated.

24:16.913 --> 24:20.333
They're either crying… or stunned.

24:21.710 --> 24:26.381
How do you think
the public will view Jung Jinsu now?

24:28.258 --> 24:30.010
His authority and symbolism…

24:33.054 --> 24:35.682
I'd say it's all destroyed.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.020
Perhaps

24:41.396 --> 24:43.440
this could be our chance to eliminate

24:43.523 --> 24:46.151
the New Truth and the Arrowhead
at the same time.

24:56.661 --> 25:00.790
Once the chaos is over,
people will want an explanation.

25:01.833 --> 25:02.709
Let's prepare one.

25:03.627 --> 25:08.507
Summon the New Truth committee
and appoint a new chairman immediately.

25:09.132 --> 25:14.596
Get them ready for the announcement
of God's New Will and Jung Jinsu's sins.

25:15.096 --> 25:17.057
Monitor their statement closely.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.685
This doesn't change anything.

25:22.062 --> 25:23.897
We will eradicate the Arrowhead

25:23.980 --> 25:27.609
and establish the New Truth and Sodo
as the two opposing powers.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.236
Is that clear?

25:29.319 --> 25:30.612
- Yes.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:33.573 --> 25:34.699
Move quickly.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.577
We may never get another chance like this.

26:22.622 --> 26:23.456
Where are we?

26:24.082 --> 26:28.169
Someone will come
to take Ms. Park Jungja to her family.

26:29.921 --> 26:30.755
Let's go.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.806
They'll be here soon.
They might already be here.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.767
Who are they? Aren't you going to tell us?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.938
Sodo's mission will be fulfilled
once Ms. Park reunites with her children.

27:13.882 --> 27:18.261
A place with toys
and something that looks like an elephant…

27:20.305 --> 27:21.431
<i>That's</i>

27:22.682 --> 27:24.059
<i>where you'll die.</i>

27:41.743 --> 27:42.744
Min Hyejin!

27:45.372 --> 27:47.040
It's no use hiding!

27:47.666 --> 27:48.625
Are you okay?

27:51.169 --> 27:53.421
We must split up. Quickly!

28:00.970 --> 28:02.263
Kim Sungjip!

28:03.348 --> 28:06.101
What are you?
Are you also with the Arrowhead?

28:14.442 --> 28:18.238
This is Sodo's decision,
not the Arrowhead's!

28:21.241 --> 28:27.747
Now that everyone knows
we have Park Jungja…

28:29.874 --> 28:34.713
we will be as powerful… as the New Truth.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.469
Are you going
to lock Park Jungja up as well?

28:54.482 --> 28:55.734
We won't lock her up.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.028
We're going to kill her.

29:01.072 --> 29:04.200
If we keep her alive
and someone else takes her,

29:06.035 --> 29:07.996
the world will fall back into chaos.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.585
But if we kill her now,
no one can take her away.

29:17.213 --> 29:19.966
You're just as crazy as them!

29:35.648 --> 29:39.152
The world needs a good lie right now.

29:41.488 --> 29:43.907
Everyone is exhausted
from the unrelenting chaos.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.703
We don't need a truth
that may not even exist.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.830
A solid lie…

29:52.999 --> 29:55.835
is the foundation we need
for a stable world.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.841
But you want to take Park Jungja
to her family?

30:04.511 --> 30:07.472
You want to plant
another seed of chaos in the world?

30:08.848 --> 30:12.143
The Arrowhead,
the New Truth, and Jung Jinsu.

30:13.603 --> 30:15.688
Do you think they ruined this world?

30:17.899 --> 30:20.693
You're the one who ruined it, Min Hyejin!

30:22.320 --> 30:23.488
It's you.

30:24.781 --> 30:28.576
It's your principles…

30:30.703 --> 30:33.039
that are throwing the world into chaos!

34:55.468 --> 34:56.302
Come on.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.184
Are you all right?

35:14.695 --> 35:15.571
You think…

35:18.366 --> 35:20.493
you're serving justice, don't you?

35:22.870 --> 35:24.122
But you

35:25.623 --> 35:30.336
just gave up the chance
for this world to return to normal.

35:35.800 --> 35:36.968
Uncuff me.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.764
This is our last chance.

35:44.308 --> 35:47.186
Our last chance to save this world.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.402
You'll have to save yourself
before you can save the world.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.615
This place is out of business,
so hardly anyone comes by.

36:22.763 --> 36:23.723
Min Hyejin!

36:25.391 --> 36:26.809
Min Hyejin!

36:31.689 --> 36:33.024
Min Hyejin!

36:33.858 --> 36:35.401
You can't take Park Jungja!

37:13.147 --> 37:13.981
Go with him.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.485
He will take you to your children.

37:21.364 --> 37:22.323
Can I

37:23.991 --> 37:26.035
trust him?

37:29.914 --> 37:34.502
He may be the only person you can trust
from now on.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.137
Thank you, Ms. Min.

37:55.189 --> 37:56.983
There's something I wanna tell you.

37:58.109 --> 37:58.985
Okay.

38:09.870 --> 38:10.705
Soon…

38:13.165 --> 38:15.334
the world will come to an end.

38:17.837 --> 38:18.838
So…

38:23.718 --> 38:24.552
you should…

38:27.805 --> 38:29.640
do what you want to do…

38:33.644 --> 38:34.603
while you can.

40:00.189 --> 40:01.315
What's…

40:04.318 --> 40:05.277
Look over there!

40:12.868 --> 40:16.789
Lee Sugyeong.

40:17.665 --> 40:23.712
You will die two years from now
at 7:00 p.m.

40:24.380 --> 40:28.676
And you are bound for Hell.

40:34.557 --> 40:38.060
Make sure to notify them of the reason
for the arrest and their rights!

40:38.811 --> 40:42.189
Follow protocol and make sure
everything's done by the book!

40:47.570 --> 40:51.532
Kim Jongmin.

40:51.615 --> 40:57.538
You will die three days from now
at 3:00 p.m.

40:58.372 --> 41:04.044
And you are bound for Hell.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.630
…you are bound for Hell.

41:40.915 --> 41:41.999
What is that?

42:15.115 --> 42:21.121
SIMULTANEOUS DECREES ACROSS THE NATION
CAUSE TERROR AND PANIC

42:21.830 --> 42:26.252
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DECREES
HAVE BEEN REPORTED

42:45.145 --> 42:45.980
Yeah?

42:47.481 --> 42:48.315
What is it?

42:50.859 --> 42:51.735
Sure.

43:00.619 --> 43:01.620
This is your mom.

43:02.329 --> 43:06.417
It's from… our picnic together, remember?

43:35.863 --> 43:36.697
Heejung.

44:03.098 --> 44:04.266
You've been strong.

44:06.935 --> 44:08.312
Rest easy now, Heejung.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.277
Hayul…

45:08.789 --> 45:10.290
is waiting for you too.

45:18.465 --> 45:19.883
You've grown so much.

45:24.722 --> 45:25.556
My dear

45:27.182 --> 45:28.392
Eunyul.

45:42.322 --> 45:44.575
Thank you.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.494
Auntie!

47:21.338 --> 47:24.800
Aunt Hyejin, are you hurt badly?

47:34.977 --> 47:35.811
Jaehyeon.

47:37.396 --> 47:38.856
Do you want to come with me?

47:43.819 --> 47:44.695
All right.

47:45.445 --> 47:49.199
Let's get out of here, okay?

48:10.971 --> 48:12.264
Is this the end for us?

48:24.151 --> 48:26.778
A new world will begin soon.

48:29.072 --> 48:30.991
Go find the world you each desire.

49:02.731 --> 49:04.274
Jaehyeon, are you ready?

49:40.268 --> 49:41.853
What's that drawing?

49:50.654 --> 49:51.488
Jaehyeon.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.450
I want to tell you a story

49:56.910 --> 49:59.579
about your parents now.

50:02.124 --> 50:06.753
About how much your mom and dad loved you.

50:10.465 --> 50:12.509
And when I'm done…

50:14.761 --> 50:16.930
I want to be your mom.

50:19.016 --> 50:20.058
What do you think?

55:14.352 --> 55:18.315
