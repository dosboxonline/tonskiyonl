00:18.810 --> 00:20.437
SINNER #3, PARK JUNGJA
ACTUAL FOOTAGE OF DECREE

00:20.520 --> 00:23.440
Park Jungja.

00:23.523 --> 00:28.361
You will die five days
from now at 3:00 p.m…

00:28.445 --> 00:31.740
After the sinner Park Jungja
informed the New Truth

00:31.823 --> 00:34.034
of the decree she received four years ago,

00:34.117 --> 00:36.578
we have entered a new era.

00:41.291 --> 00:46.629
ALTHOUGH HER HOLY DEMONSTRATION
ALLOWED FOR US TO ENTER A NEW ERA

00:47.130 --> 00:48.715
Unfortunately,

00:48.798 --> 00:51.926
the sinner did not confess her sins
until the final moment.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.636
THE NEW TRUTH

00:55.972 --> 01:02.353
AFTER THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST SINNER'S
DEMONSTRATION WAS OPENED TO THE PUBLIC

01:04.564 --> 01:07.817
IT CONTINUES TO BE AN EXAMPLE FOR MANY WHO
VISIT THE SACRED SITE AT HAPSEONG STATION

01:07.901 --> 01:10.737
God has clearly shown His will

01:10.820 --> 01:13.323
through different forms
of divine intervention.

01:14.783 --> 01:19.079
However, we are too afraid and ashamed
to have our sins revealed

01:19.162 --> 01:22.457
and try hard to conceal
the message from God.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.670
Sinners try to face the demonstration
where nobody can witness it.

01:28.338 --> 01:31.674
Among the sinners who received the decree,

01:31.758 --> 01:33.676
some foolish ones take their own lives

01:33.760 --> 01:36.137
without waiting for the day of judgment.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.642
This man was known to have committed
suicide because his business failed.

01:42.352 --> 01:45.980
He was brought back to life
at the time of his demonstration

01:46.064 --> 01:50.151
and faced damnation
in front of his friends and family.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.072
His arrogance led him to believe
that he could avoid the wrath of God,

01:54.948 --> 01:57.659
but God didn't allow it.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.330
So what does God want from us?

02:04.332 --> 02:08.253
He's telling us to be more righteous.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.963
That's right.

02:10.046 --> 02:13.800
That is God's will.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.929
My father is a sinner.

02:18.012 --> 02:19.931
SINNER #27, SONG HYEONSEOP
INTERVIEW WITH FAMILY

02:20.014 --> 02:23.893
He used his corporate credit card
for his personal expenses.

02:26.187 --> 02:30.150
He also has sinful videos on his computer.

02:33.194 --> 02:34.404
My father is a sinner

02:35.613 --> 02:38.324
who deserves to go to Hell.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.707
GOD'S WILL II

02:46.875 --> 02:50.211
SINNER #3, PARK JUNGJA - SACRED LOCATION
OF DEMONSTRATION IN BUKHYEON-DONG

02:50.295 --> 02:52.380
A society that
does not shy away from sins.

02:53.464 --> 02:57.886
We must not hide our sins nor those
of our family members or friends.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.721
2ND CHAIRMAN OF THE NEW TRUTH
KIM JEONGCHIL

02:59.804 --> 03:01.139
SINNER PARK JUNGJA'S REMAINS

03:01.222 --> 03:03.474
Don't end up like the sinner Park Jungja.

03:07.145 --> 03:09.898
No. Do not try to hide your sins.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.609
Confess your sins.
Do not try to silence God.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.820
Do not get in the way

03:16.821 --> 03:17.947
of God's will.

03:20.825 --> 03:21.784
THE NEW TRUTH

03:21.868 --> 03:23.786
The New Truth will be with you

03:25.455 --> 03:30.460
as you strive to be more righteous.

03:32.003 --> 03:38.968
YOU CAN FIND GOD'S WILL
ON THE NEW TRUTH APP

03:51.522 --> 03:55.401
Well, this is just a first cut.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.529
We managed to secure a slot

03:58.613 --> 04:01.741
right after the most popular TV drama,
But First, Love.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.078
So, what do you think?

04:06.829 --> 04:08.957
Well, thanks for sharing
the first cut with us,

04:10.833 --> 04:13.711
but I'm concerned about
the close-up shot of Park Jungja's face.

04:15.588 --> 04:19.008
The shot shows too much emotion
on the sinner's face.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.428
And the background music
is a bit too sentimental.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.307
I'm afraid it could
make some viewers pity the sinner.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.519
We have emphasized multiple times

04:30.186 --> 04:32.230
that the sinners
should still look like sinners.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.567
What's so funny?

04:38.111 --> 04:40.488
Why don't you just
run your own TV station?

04:49.622 --> 04:52.875
Producer Bae Youngjae?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.796
You're the producer in charge
of this campaign documentary,

04:57.505 --> 04:59.590
but you seem to have something
against the New Truth.

04:59.674 --> 05:02.927
Actually, I'm the lead producer.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.680
Producer Bae is an assistant producer.

05:05.763 --> 05:08.016
Who says I'm an assistant?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.935
I'm a co-producer.

05:12.979 --> 05:15.898
It's not that I have anything
against your organization…

05:19.610 --> 05:20.778
Actually, you're right.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.281
I do.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.702
Do I need to ask your permission
for what background music to use?

05:27.785 --> 05:31.247
That's enough, Producer Bae.
Don't be rude to the deacons.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.460
If not the deacons, who else is
going to sign-off on the documentary?

05:35.543 --> 05:36.586
Sir.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.132
Enough is enough. What are we doing here?

05:41.215 --> 05:45.094
We shouldn't be asking for them
to approve every little detail.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.804
Can we really call ourselves the press?

05:46.888 --> 05:50.933
Are we some kind of production company
under the New Truth?

05:51.017 --> 05:52.101
Damn it.

05:53.102 --> 05:55.772
I thought we were working together
to do what's right.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.901
but I guess you consider us
merely one of your clients.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.821
Do you not approve of the changes
we are making for the world?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.784
If you look at the crime rate,
it has dropped significantly since--

06:07.867 --> 06:09.327
Who believes those numbers?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.205
Tell me.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.958
People are too afraid
to report the Arrowhead's crimes.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.961
If you count them,
I bet the crime rate would skyrocket.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.381
They recently went
to one of the subject's houses

06:21.464 --> 06:23.925
and wrote something in spray paint.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.676
What was it again?

06:26.427 --> 06:27.595
"The home of a sinner"?

06:29.555 --> 06:31.516
They turned the house upside down

06:32.392 --> 06:35.019
and beat up the family, didn't they?

06:36.187 --> 06:38.064
Do you really not see a problem

06:38.147 --> 06:41.984
in a world where a ten-year-old kid
calls her father a sinner?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.236
Enough.

06:43.319 --> 06:47.532
Making the world a better place
through intimidation and condemnation?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.702
That reminds me of somewhere.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.498
-Hell.
-Stop it already, you bastard!!

06:56.082 --> 06:57.041
What the heck?

06:57.125 --> 06:58.000
What…

07:00.962 --> 07:02.713
Oh… Please excuse them.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.216
You've done a great job so far.
Stop that now.

07:07.009 --> 07:11.264
Anyway, we will make sure to apply
your feedback to the final cut.

07:11.347 --> 07:13.307
In terms of the broadcast slot,

07:13.391 --> 07:17.520
we are thinking of rerunning it five times
a week, so no need to worry.

07:18.146 --> 07:22.233
Producer Bae is feeling
the pressure to meet the deadline.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.193
He became a father a few days ago.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.571
Why would you bring that up?

07:26.654 --> 07:27.822
For God's sake.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.949
I guess we were a bit overzealous.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.870
I'm not saying the quality is bad.
It's good overall.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.416
We'll trust you with it, then.

07:39.375 --> 07:43.171
I'll let the chairman know
that everything's going smoothly.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.797
Thank you so much.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.048
Please don't worry.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.303
Sorry, I should have gotten that for you.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.639
Well, then. Take care.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.557
Take care.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.270
-They're such stuck-up jerks.
-Have a safe return trip.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.273
Hey.

08:03.232 --> 08:05.276
Are you two out of your minds?

08:06.110 --> 08:07.820
Youngjae, you asshole.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.157
You'd better apply their feedback today.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.366
Sir, that's too…

08:14.202 --> 08:17.580
I need to go see my baby at the hospital.
I thought we were done here.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.249
Why did you rub them the wrong way, then?

08:20.333 --> 08:21.459
Do you think I want to…

08:22.043 --> 08:23.836
-Forget it.
-Damn it.

08:23.920 --> 08:28.424
Anyway, make the segment with the kid's
interview longer, just like they said.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.092
I liked that segment.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.179
It made me want
to forgive my sins and repent.

08:33.262 --> 08:34.722
Fix it like they wanted.

08:34.805 --> 08:36.599
-Sir!
-Just do it!

08:37.308 --> 08:38.309
Damn.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.770
What's gotten into you?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.356
Why are you bowing down to those assholes?

08:43.856 --> 08:44.815
Junwon!

08:47.443 --> 08:50.363
Damn, what's up with them?

09:00.915 --> 09:02.083
Hey, Sohyun. One moment.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.794
Hi, Toughie's father.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.337
You must be really busy.

09:06.420 --> 09:08.923
You've left for the hospital, right?

09:09.006 --> 09:11.300
I'm sorry, but I need
to re-edit the documentary.

09:12.301 --> 09:14.178
I won't be finished until later tonight.

09:15.012 --> 09:15.846
How are you feeling?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.932
What do you think?
It's hurting like crazy.

09:18.015 --> 09:18.849
What's wrong?

09:19.475 --> 09:22.061
The doctor said you were okay
when I talked to him on the phone.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.813
I just feel helpless.

09:25.064 --> 09:28.067
Our baby is in the intensive care unit,

09:28.150 --> 09:29.902
so I can't even visit when I want.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.699
The baby should be okay, right?

09:34.782 --> 09:36.450
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

09:36.534 --> 09:39.203
Don't worry too much.
The doctor said the baby is okay.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.206
You can't come during visiting hours
if you have to work overtime, can you?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.374
Hello.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.211
Well, I guess not.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.756
I think I should just take the day off
tomorrow and visit in the morning.

09:51.632 --> 09:52.800
How about…

09:54.552 --> 09:57.805
I send you a video
of our little fighter later today?

09:57.888 --> 10:00.808
A video? Are you allowed
to take your phone in?

10:00.891 --> 10:03.477
It should be okay.
I'll only use it briefly.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.605
Okay. Send me a video if you can.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.232
I'll get it done as fast as I can.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.402
I'm sorry, and I love you.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.446
All right.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.786
Misuk.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.456
Hear me out, Misuk.

10:23.539 --> 10:26.542
We need to re-edit, don't we?
It's written on your face.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.669
Fuck, those damn New Truth freaks.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.213
Don't say anything bad about them.
It scares me.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.882
Because I'll go to Hell for it?

10:32.965 --> 10:35.801
No. What if you turn out to be
a member of the Arrowhead?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.553
Well, that's reasonable.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.430
What are you working on?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.266
It's a new current affairs show.

10:42.350 --> 10:46.646
An individual would get overwhelmed
in the face of divine intervention.

10:46.729 --> 10:47.563
Who is this guy?

10:47.647 --> 10:50.316
A desire to disappear from society
leads them to vanish.

10:50.399 --> 10:51.484
It's basically suicide.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.653
Where do we find these new panelists?

10:56.238 --> 10:57.865
What do they want us to revise?

10:57.948 --> 10:59.575
We need to change the music

11:00.576 --> 11:04.372
and re-edit the interviews
of the sinners' families.

11:04.455 --> 11:06.540
Come back later with the interview script.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.917
I'd say in two hours.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.001
Two hours?

11:11.796 --> 11:12.797
How about in an hour?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.175
It won't take long.
It's just a simple fix.

11:16.258 --> 11:17.635
Where's the script?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.553
I think Producer Kang has it.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.972
-Producer Kang? You mean Junwon?
-Yes.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.978
Come on. You shouldn't eat this junk.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.526
Why isn't he picking up?
What's wrong with this guy?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.236
Hey, Misuk.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.198
-I'll be back in an hour, okay?
-Okay.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.283
Oh!

11:42.159 --> 11:43.911
Congratulations on becoming a father.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.041
-Oh, hello.
-Hi.

11:50.626 --> 11:55.214
Our society is to blame
for failing to keep up with the times.

11:55.297 --> 11:58.759
We shouldn't see this phenomenon
as an individual violating the norms.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.553
Damn, where did he go?

12:00.636 --> 12:01.971
Has anyone seen Junwon?

12:02.722 --> 12:03.723
Jun…

12:04.223 --> 12:05.975
-Anyone? No one's seen him?
-No.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.282
SODO QUICK LOAN
CALL FOR LOAN INQUIRIES

12:21.907 --> 12:23.200
"Yangpyeong fishing spot"?

12:26.245 --> 12:27.204
What is this?

12:30.332 --> 12:34.086
What the hell?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

12:35.379 --> 12:38.632
-Are you into fishing these days?
-No… Well, yes. What's up?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.678
I was at the editing room
and came here to get the interview script.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.389
Did you forget the bald man
told us to revise our cut?

12:46.682 --> 12:48.934
Let's start working on it
together in an hour.

12:49.018 --> 12:50.019
You know…

12:51.729 --> 12:54.190
I'm sorry, Youngjae,

12:55.691 --> 12:57.777
but I have to go somewhere with my wife.

12:57.860 --> 12:58.736
What?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.530
Please take care of it, all right?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.365
Junwon. Hey, stop.

13:04.241 --> 13:08.204
I only got to see my baby for ten minutes.
Can you believe that?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.374
At this rate, my wife will divorce me.
Help me out here.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.585
Youngjae.

13:16.670 --> 13:19.256
Well… Sorry about earlier.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.093
Please take care of it.

13:24.762 --> 13:26.555
Are you seriously leaving?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.015
Oh, you are.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.362
Check where your baby's bed is here.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.572

It's still early, though.

16:08.759 --> 16:09.593
Hello?

16:10.094 --> 16:14.056
Hello? This is Junwon's wife.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.725
Oh, hello. Why are you calling?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.937
I can't seem to reach Junwon.

16:20.688 --> 16:22.272
Did you see him at work today?

16:23.107 --> 16:26.402
Of course. He left early saying
he was going somewhere with you.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.444
Oh, really?

16:28.320 --> 16:32.157
Did he seem okay? Did you notice
anything strange about him?

16:33.200 --> 16:34.785
Nothing in particular.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.332
I think something's wrong.

16:41.291 --> 16:42.584
Like what?

16:43.627 --> 16:48.007
Well, a few days ago,
some loan sharks contacted me

16:48.090 --> 16:50.384
and told me to pay back the money he owed.

16:50.467 --> 16:54.513
They said he was a gambling addict.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.475
He's okay, though, right?

17:00.602 --> 17:02.187
They said he gambles?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.565
No way.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.525
I don't think he does.
Let me look into it.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.485
-Okay.
-Don't worry too much.

17:08.569 --> 17:10.946
He must be sleeping
at a sauna or something.

17:12.656 --> 17:16.326
If you happen to reach him,
please tell him to call me right away.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.953
Okay, will do.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.496
Don't worry too much.

17:19.580 --> 17:21.040
Okay, thank you.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.088
Has he finally lost his mind
in this crazy world?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.632
Why would he borrow money
from loan sharks?

17:32.134 --> 17:33.552
Is he having an affair?

Why can't he deal

I can't see a damn thing.

What?

Damn it.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.022
What do you want?

21:14.106 --> 21:15.983
Where are you traveling from?

21:16.692 --> 21:17.818
Seoul. Is there a problem?

21:18.402 --> 21:19.278
Seoul?

21:20.612 --> 21:24.074
There's nothing ahead.
What are you here for?

21:24.157 --> 21:28.203
Why do I need to tell you that?

21:28.287 --> 21:31.498
Dude, I told you this car is from Seoul.

21:32.207 --> 21:36.628
I'm just wondering why you would drive
all the way here from Seoul.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.797
As someone who protects this neighborhood.

I need to shoot some scenery,

21:54.813 --> 21:55.647
okay?

21:56.231 --> 21:58.483
I have no time to go location scouting,

21:58.567 --> 22:01.236
so I came here to work
and get some fresh air as well.

22:01.987 --> 22:02.863
Bullshit.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.574
Did you really drive all the way
here at night to get some fresh air?

22:06.366 --> 22:08.952
You're here to meet
your mistress, aren't you?

22:09.036 --> 22:10.037
Hey, keep quiet.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.997
This is driving me crazy. Fuck.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.081
-Sir…
-What?

22:13.165 --> 22:17.252
I noticed that one

22:32.392 --> 22:34.644
You've got to be considerate of others.

-All right.
-You got it?

Yes.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.198
What crazy jerks.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.033
I'm sure he's having an affair.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.880
I can't believe him.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.881
Hey, Junwon.

23:49.803 --> 23:50.762
Where did he go?

23:58.311 --> 24:01.273
Where did he go? Damn it.

Please leave a message after the beep.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.455
Are you crazy?

24:58.538 --> 24:59.539

25:00.582 --> 25:01.708
Seriously?

25:04.711 --> 25:06.254
-Junwon!
-Go away!

25:06.338 --> 25:07.631
-Come out!
-Go away!

25:07.714 --> 25:10.592
Come out now! What are you doing? Whoa!

25:10.675 --> 25:11.968
Let go! Let go of me!

25:12.052 --> 25:13.637
-What's wrong with you?
-Let go!

25:13.720 --> 25:14.596
Come here.

25:15.096 --> 25:16.848
Are you drunk?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.893
-Let go of me, please!
-Come here. Let's talk.

25:19.976 --> 25:22.020
What the hell is wrong with you?

25:23.021 --> 25:24.272
How did you come here?

25:26.149 --> 25:27.526
I drove. What's wrong?

25:27.609 --> 25:29.152
Your wife called me.

25:29.236 --> 25:30.362
Come out and talk.

25:31.071 --> 25:31.947
Please…

25:33.782 --> 25:36.076
Please just pretend you didn't see me.

25:36.159 --> 25:39.329
Come out already!
I need to go see my baby.

25:39.412 --> 25:41.957
My wife is waiting for me.
Come out now. Seriously.

25:42.666 --> 25:43.625
I…

25:47.879 --> 25:49.005
I…

25:49.673 --> 25:50.840
I received a prophecy.

25:52.759 --> 25:53.593
What?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.388
I'm going to Hell soon.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.683
What did you just say?

26:00.475 --> 26:02.519
Youngjae, I'm begging you.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.981
I'm begging you. Please.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.316
Just… Just pretend you didn't find me.

26:08.817 --> 26:12.988
No one will find out that
I'm bound for Hell if you keep quiet.

26:13.071 --> 26:13.905
So, please…

26:16.449 --> 26:17.409
Junwon.

26:21.162 --> 26:24.666
Please pretend you didn't find me.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.836
Junwon. Look at me. Come on.

26:28.837 --> 26:29.713
Are you okay?

26:32.132 --> 26:33.967
I'm bound for Hell.

26:34.843 --> 26:35.760
My family…

26:37.637 --> 26:38.805
They will…

26:40.056 --> 26:43.184
They will live with the shame
of being the family of a sinner.

26:44.311 --> 26:45.478
Please, Youngjae.

26:45.562 --> 26:51.151
The New Truth and the Arrowhead

26:55.447 --> 26:57.907
Please, Youngjae.
Pretend you didn't see me.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.075
What about you?

27:00.160 --> 27:01.911
What's going to happen to you?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.289
What will happen?
What are you going to do?

27:04.372 --> 27:08.585
People from Sodo
will take care of things for me.

27:09.169 --> 27:12.088
They will make it look like
I vanished without a trace.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.590
Who are these Sodo people?

27:13.673 --> 27:15.425
Listen, Youngjae.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.304
Pull yourself together.
You have to pretend you know nothing.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.056
Otherwise,

27:21.556 --> 27:24.059
the Sodo people won't leave you alone.

27:24.142 --> 27:25.352
What on earth…

27:25.435 --> 27:26.269
Youngjae.

27:27.145 --> 27:28.146
You should go now.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.689
Junwon.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.524
You should go!

27:32.108 --> 27:33.443
Don't come any closer.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.653
Go away! Now!

27:54.798 --> 27:55.882
Youngjae.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.802
My wife…

28:00.762 --> 28:02.722
Don't tell my wife about this.

28:02.806 --> 28:03.682
Junwon.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.560
This…

28:08.436 --> 28:09.562
This is for the best.

28:28.957 --> 28:29.874

28:29.958 --> 28:31.876

28:33.670 --> 28:35.380
Junwon!

28:52.564 --> 28:53.481
Junwon!

29:11.750 --> 29:13.418
Where did he go?

30:21.110 --> 30:21.945
Junwon.

30:27.992 --> 30:30.161
All right, let's get this over with.

30:30.245 --> 30:31.579
Let's hurry.

30:32.455 --> 30:36.167
Shit, water, of course.
And I didn't bring my boots.

30:41.464 --> 30:43.341

30:43.424 --> 30:45.593
Hold it. Let's put it back there.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.513

-Three.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.223
Junwon.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.517
Who are you people?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.434
Come on.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.145
Junwon!

30:56.229 --> 30:57.438
Let go of me!

30:58.022 --> 31:00.441
Let go and talk to me!

31:00.525 --> 31:02.068
Who the hell are you?

31:02.151 --> 31:03.736
What are you going to do to me?

31:03.820 --> 31:06.364
-Producer Bae.
-Let go of me! Who are you?

31:06.447 --> 31:07.740
Producer Bae!

31:10.451 --> 31:11.286
What?

31:11.369 --> 31:13.079
It's basically suicide.

31:13.955 --> 31:16.499
You'd better forget about
what you witnessed today.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.669
Don't try looking into this.

31:20.503 --> 31:22.255
Otherwise, you'll be put in danger.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.135
What about Junwon? He…

31:53.286 --> 31:54.329
Hyeongjun,

31:54.412 --> 31:56.414
you shouldn't have revealed your face.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.207
He can be trusted.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.375
Bullshit.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.045
People would sell their own parents
if the New Truth told them to.

32:02.128 --> 32:03.171
No one can be trusted.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.965
Are we really going to
let him go like this?

32:07.091 --> 32:09.177
If anything happens,
you'll be held responsible.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.637
Let's keep a watch on him

32:11.638 --> 32:12.972
and see how he reacts.

33:36.681 --> 33:37.640
Sorry.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.435
How pretty.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.687
My baby.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.401
Hello.

34:38.367 --> 34:39.327
You're up.

34:43.664 --> 34:46.626
The editing took longer than I expected.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.295
And my phone ran out of battery.

35:37.176 --> 35:40.763
Don't stray too far.
Search along the path!

35:40.847 --> 35:42.265
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

35:43.724 --> 35:47.353
This is where the missing person
made their last call. Search thoroughly.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.988
Come on, get in there!

35:57.071 --> 35:58.489
Damn, really…

36:00.992 --> 36:04.287
Are there other areas
you can access by car?

36:04.370 --> 36:06.664
There are no residential areas
around here,

36:06.747 --> 36:10.334
and I already checked
the two farm roads over there.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.795
Thank you for your cooperation.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.213
You're very welcome.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.132
We're glad we could be of help.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.093
But…

36:20.178 --> 36:23.848
are there really a lot of people
who hide that they received the decree?

36:25.224 --> 36:26.726
Yes, because…

36:28.769 --> 36:31.105
it's hard to overcome the shame.

36:34.192 --> 36:38.613
Withdraw! Everyone,
get ready to head back to the station.

36:38.696 --> 36:41.157
What do you mean?
Who ordered you to stop searching?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.368
Mr. Kang Junwon's car was caught
by a surveillance camera at a tollgate.

36:44.452 --> 36:45.745
He's not here.

36:45.828 --> 36:47.496
Have you found the car?

36:47.580 --> 36:50.583
You can't go anywhere without
getting caught on a surveillance camera.

36:50.666 --> 36:51.792
We're sure we'll find…

36:55.463 --> 36:56.923
Let's head back.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.883
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.177
Come out.

37:01.260 --> 37:02.220
Tell him to come out.

37:02.303 --> 37:03.137
Get your stuff.

37:03.221 --> 37:04.472
Don't forget that.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.158
No matter how much I search…

37:27.453 --> 37:28.537
I can't find a case…

37:31.374 --> 37:33.334
where a newborn baby

37:35.002 --> 37:37.296
was sent to Hell.

37:39.632 --> 37:42.802
Something must have gone wrong, right?

37:46.764 --> 37:48.599
What could a newborn baby have done…

37:52.937 --> 37:54.855
Does this mean I gave birth to a sinner?

37:55.856 --> 37:56.774
Is that it?

37:59.777 --> 38:01.445
Did I do something wrong?

38:05.199 --> 38:06.575
What should we do?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.453
You did nothing wrong.

38:09.537 --> 38:10.955
What should we do?

38:17.128 --> 38:19.755
Let's go home with our baby.
I'll look into it.
