00:01.584 --> 00:03.586
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:30.572 --> 00:31.573
JASON: Peter.

00:32.615 --> 00:34.075
Your momma wants to speak with you.

00:34.826 --> 00:35.994
MEREDITH: Peter?

00:38.413 --> 00:39.414
Take my hand.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.959
PETER: I've been lost before.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.796
But then I found meaning.

00:49.466 --> 00:50.467
Found love.

00:52.552 --> 00:53.970
And yeah, it got taken from me,

00:56.139 --> 00:57.348
and God, that hurts.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.645
You ever feel lost, look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

01:04.439 --> 01:06.316
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.445
All right. Bye.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.572
KORATH: What is your name?

01:12.655 --> 01:14.866
My name is Peter Quill, okay?
Dude, chill out.

01:14.949 --> 01:15.950
Move!

01:16.034 --> 01:18.620
Hey, you know what?
There's another name might know me by.

01:18.995 --> 01:19.996
Star-Lord.

01:28.797 --> 01:29.798
Who?

01:29.881 --> 01:31.966
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.553
-Star-Lord.
-Oh. Sorry. "Lord."

01:35.970 --> 01:38.389
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.

01:38.598 --> 01:43.019
Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries
called the Ravagers, led by Yondu Udonta.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.562
What a bunch of a-holes.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.190
PETER: Hey. Put that away.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.777
That's mine. Those belong to impound.
That tape and that player is mine!

01:50.860 --> 01:52.112
-(GRUNTING)
-(STATIC CRACKLING)

01:55.740 --> 01:57.492
GAMORA: Why would you
risk your life for this?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.285
My mother gave it to me.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.541
I look around at us.

02:05.708 --> 02:06.709
You know what I see?

02:07.001 --> 02:08.002
Losers.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.089
Folks who have lost stuff.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.424
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.636
Usually, life takes more
than it gives. But not today.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.098
Today, it's given us something.
It has given us a chance.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.182
To do what?

02:21.474 --> 02:22.475
Not run away.

02:23.184 --> 02:25.562
I, for one, am not gonna
stand by and watch

02:25.854 --> 02:28.481
as Ronan wipes out
billions of innocent lives.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.234
But, Quill, you're asking us to die.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.153
Yeah, I guess I am.

02:33.903 --> 02:38.158
Xandar! You stand accused.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.786
All Ronan's gotta do is touch the Stone
to the planet's surface and zap.

02:41.870 --> 02:43.037
GAMORA: Everything will die.

02:44.205 --> 02:45.373
Quill, you gotta hurry.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.597
No!

03:03.892 --> 03:05.018
Take my hand, Peter.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.353
-Mom.
-GAMORA: Peter!

03:10.857 --> 03:11.900
RONAN: You're mortal!

03:12.984 --> 03:13.985
How?

03:14.944 --> 03:16.654
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.661
EGO: When I heard of a man from Earth

03:23.745 --> 03:26.748
who held an Infinity Stone
in his hand without dying...

03:27.373 --> 03:30.460
I knew you must be the son
of the woman I loved.

03:31.753 --> 03:32.837
And who the hell are you?

03:34.797 --> 03:36.132
My name is Ego...

03:38.176 --> 03:39.385
and I'm your dad, Peter.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.638
DRAX: I thought Yondu was your father.

03:41.804 --> 03:45.266
This whole time you thought Yondu
was my actual blood relative?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.268
You look exactly alike.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.686
One's blue!

03:50.772 --> 03:52.023
PETER: You have your own planet?

03:52.273 --> 03:54.192
I'm what's called a Celestial.

03:54.943 --> 03:56.110
PETER: Like a god?

03:57.195 --> 03:58.279
Small "g," son.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.118
It was with Meredith
that I first experienced love.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.204
And from that love, Peter...

04:07.705 --> 04:08.706
you.

04:10.792 --> 04:11.793
PETER: I'm immortal?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.628
Mmm-hmm.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.547
EGO: As long as the light burns
within the planet.

04:19.217 --> 04:20.218
MANTIS: The bodies...

04:21.511 --> 04:22.595
are his children.

04:22.804 --> 04:25.974
EGO: Only we can remake the universe.

04:26.891 --> 04:27.934
PETER: But my mother...

04:28.559 --> 04:30.311
You said you loved my mother.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.063
EGO: And that I did.

04:33.731 --> 04:36.234
It broke my heart
to put that tumor in her head.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.653
Mom? No! No!

04:39.862 --> 04:40.863
What?

04:40.947 --> 04:43.700
Now, all right, I know that sounds...

04:47.537 --> 04:49.998
EGO: You really need to grow up.

04:50.623 --> 04:51.791
-No.
-(CRACKS)

04:57.463 --> 05:00.425
You shouldn't have killed my mom,
and squished my Walkman.

05:02.427 --> 05:05.138
(BOTH GRUNTING)

05:05.555 --> 05:06.597
EGO: If you kill me...

05:07.307 --> 05:09.434
you'll be just like everybody else.

05:09.517 --> 05:10.977
What's so wrong with that?

05:11.394 --> 05:12.395
No!

05:19.610 --> 05:23.072
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.325
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.122
PETER: No! No!

05:32.457 --> 05:33.458
No!

05:36.002 --> 05:39.380
When I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.592
Yondu didn't have a talking car,

05:42.675 --> 05:46.387
but both Yondu and David Hasselhoff
went on kick-ass adventures

05:46.471 --> 05:48.097
and hooked up with hot women...

05:49.223 --> 05:50.308
and fought robots.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.981
Sometimes that thing you're searching
for your whole life...

05:58.107 --> 05:59.901
it's right there by your side all along.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.361
You don't even know it.

06:01.986 --> 06:02.987
It's just...

06:03.821 --> 06:04.822
What?

06:06.866 --> 06:08.117
GAMORA: Some unspoken thing.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.580
PETER: Let her go, Grimace.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.709
(SOBBING) I love you more than anything.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.337
(SOFTLY) I love you, too.

06:22.465 --> 06:23.800
STARK: All right, I have a plan.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.009
I like your plan.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.637
Except it sucks,
so let me do the plan...

06:27.762 --> 06:29.472
and that way it might be really good.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.061
PETER: Where is she?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.396
He took her to Vormir.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.689
He came back with the Soul Stone.
But she didn't.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.358
(GRUNTING)

06:42.360 --> 06:44.153
(ALL SHOUTING)

06:50.076 --> 06:51.911
(YELLING)

07:08.886 --> 07:10.805
Wait. So does that make you my sister?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.852
That's the greatest
Christmas gift I could ever get.
