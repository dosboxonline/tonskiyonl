WEBVTT

01:20.765 --> 01:22.725
<i>Yes.</i>

01:58.133 --> 02:00.051
<i>Yes.</i>

02:22.697 --> 02:24.657
<i>Yes.</i>

02:45.760 --> 02:47.720
<i>Please. Please.
Don't worry. Don't worry.</i>

02:47.803 --> 02:50.598
It's utter chaos around here.

02:50.681 --> 02:53.308
And I'm terrified that
we're running out of time.

02:53.392 --> 02:55.310
Am I trying to be
too perfect?

02:55.394 --> 02:57.646
- Oh, but I want it to be so exquisite.
- So do we.

02:57.729 --> 03:02.233
- But we're trying to be too exquisite.
- Why not aim for the stars?

03:02.275 --> 03:04.235
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

03:04.277 --> 03:07.655
- We do need some answers on the flowers.
- Ah, yes, freesia, freesia.

03:07.738 --> 03:10.741
Everywhere freesia.
Daddy loves freesia.

03:10.825 --> 03:13.911
Good morning. Good morning.
Oh. Hello. Hi.

03:13.994 --> 03:15.954
<i>- Lights?
- "Lights. "</i>

03:15.996 --> 03:20.041
Not too bright
and not too dark.

03:20.125 --> 03:23.002
I'm looking for
a saffron glow,

03:23.086 --> 03:25.338
sort of tea-dance '20s.

03:25.421 --> 03:27.590
If food is the prose
of a party,

03:27.632 --> 03:30.885
then lights
are its poetry.

03:34.430 --> 03:37.474
It works. If food is the prose of
a party, lights are its poetry.

03:37.557 --> 03:41.936
I like that. If music were the food of
love, play on. I'm going out of my mind.

03:41.978 --> 03:43.938
Good morning,
Mr. Parrish.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.691
- What do you think of all this, Helen?
- It's gonna be beautiful.

03:46.774 --> 03:49.193
And Allison says
the president may come.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.446
<i>The president's got better things to do
than come to my birthday party.</i>

03:51.447 --> 03:52.747
Like what?

03:53.030 --> 03:55.199
- Daddy? Do you have a minute?
- Good morning, Allison.

03:55.282 --> 03:57.451
Not much more.
Big day in the big city.

03:57.534 --> 03:59.995
- What's on your mind?
- Fireworks. Update:

04:00.036 --> 04:02.872
We are constructing
the number 65 on the barge.

04:02.956 --> 04:06.834
Archers from the State College of New
Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it.

04:06.876 --> 04:11.338
When it catches fire, it will give
us the effect of a Viking funeral,

04:11.380 --> 04:13.340
but with none
of the morbidity.

04:13.382 --> 04:16.468
The Hudson River Authority says that for
you, they'll make a special dispensation.

04:16.551 --> 04:19.387
But, of course, there will be
an overtime bill...

04:19.471 --> 04:21.389
for the Poughkeepsie
Fire Department.

04:21.473 --> 04:24.851
So, what do you think?

04:24.892 --> 04:27.311
Good?
No good?

04:27.395 --> 04:30.564
Allison, I trust you.
This is your thing.

04:30.648 --> 04:34.610
But it's your birthday. I hate
arrows. They make me nervous.

04:35.736 --> 04:38.113
- Good morning, Dad.
- Good morning, honey.

04:38.196 --> 04:40.532
- Morning.
- Morning. You're "Honey. " I'm "Allison. "

04:40.615 --> 04:42.826
Oh.

04:42.909 --> 04:47.205
Oh, Dad, Drew called from the helicopter,
and they're still two minutes away.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.415
- Drew's aboard?
- Mm-hmm.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.500
He wanted to ride
back down with you.

04:51.584 --> 04:55.712
So why don't you sit down, relax, and get
some food in that flat tummy of yours.

04:55.754 --> 04:57.714
- Are you coming?
- No.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.009
You've got patients to attend to.
I've got three hysterical chefs,

05:01.092 --> 05:03.136
one of whom loves truffles,
the other one hates truffles,

05:03.219 --> 05:05.596
and the third one doesn't
even know what truffles are.

05:05.680 --> 05:08.391
- I hate parties.
- But, Daddy, calm down.

05:08.432 --> 05:10.684
You're gonna love it.
I swear.

05:10.768 --> 05:14.021
Isn't it enough to be on the Earth for 65
years without having to be reminded of it?

05:14.104 --> 05:17.357
No.

05:19.442 --> 05:22.695
Will you relax?
I know it's a big deal day.

05:22.779 --> 05:26.115
- How'd you know that?
- Drew told me.

05:26.157 --> 05:28.117
Does he tell you everything?

05:28.159 --> 05:30.744
I hope so.

05:30.786 --> 05:33.122
You like him, don't you?

05:33.205 --> 05:35.958
Yep, I guess so.

05:36.041 --> 05:38.585
- I don't want to interfere, but, uh...
- Then don't.

05:41.046 --> 05:43.590
<i>Well, here comes our boy now.</i>

05:43.631 --> 05:45.591
Shall we?

05:46.884 --> 05:49.303
- Okay.
- Hello, beautiful.

05:50.471 --> 05:52.431
Hi.

05:56.810 --> 05:59.521
Good morning, Drew.
Thanks for coming up.

05:59.604 --> 06:03.316
Well, big day. Wanted to line up
a few ducks before kickoff.

06:03.399 --> 06:06.235
Any thoughts, last minute
refinements, variations, anything?

06:06.319 --> 06:10.531
Thoughts, no.
I did hear a voice last night.

06:10.614 --> 06:12.700
- A voice?
- In my sleep.

06:12.783 --> 06:15.244
- What'd it say?
- "Yes. "

06:15.327 --> 06:19.080
- Yes to the deal?
- Maybe. Who knows?

06:19.164 --> 06:21.082
You know how voices are.

06:21.166 --> 06:24.419
Hmm?
I thank you, Delia.

06:24.460 --> 06:26.712
Okay, let's go.
Delia, your pen.

06:27.922 --> 06:30.091
<i>- Hi, Bill. How you doin'?
- Morning, Quince.</i>

06:30.174 --> 06:32.760
- I'm doin' great, and you?
- Oh, I'm great.

06:32.843 --> 06:35.387
- This is it, "B-day. "
- Huh? Sorry.

06:35.429 --> 06:39.266
Bontecou day.
We're gonna close... with Big John.

06:39.349 --> 06:41.309
Look at you, Bill.
You're all cool as a cat.

06:41.393 --> 06:44.687
Over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's
just shittin' in his pants.

06:44.771 --> 06:48.524
Remember, everybody,
big meeting tonight at Daddy's.

06:48.608 --> 06:52.278
Dinner. You, too, Drew.
We have lots of loose ends.

06:52.361 --> 06:55.906
- Not my birthday again?
- You're only 65 once, Dad.

06:55.989 --> 06:57.949
Thank God.
Now let's get the day started.

06:57.991 --> 07:00.577
<i>Remember, dinner in the city
at Daddy's!</i>

07:12.963 --> 07:16.174
Mm-hmm.
It's so ridiculous.

07:16.258 --> 07:18.260
<i>Do you love Drew?</i>

07:18.343 --> 07:21.638
<i>No, don't do anything.
Just stay exactly where...</i>

07:22.781 --> 07:24.518
Do you love Drew?

07:24.519 --> 07:27.319
<i>He's not gonna get a better offer than that.</i>

07:27.602 --> 07:32.606
- You mean, like you loved Mom?
- Forget about me and Mom.

07:34.525 --> 07:39.237
<i>- Are you gonna marry him?
- Oh, come on.</i>

07:40.322 --> 07:42.240
I'm probably.

07:42.323 --> 07:45.159
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy.
He's smart. He's aggressive.

07:45.243 --> 07:50.247
<i>He could carry Parrish Communications
into the 21st century and me along with it.</i>

07:50.331 --> 07:53.250
Mm-hmm.
So, what's wrong with that?

07:53.334 --> 07:55.711
That's for me.
I'm talking about you.

07:57.254 --> 08:00.215
<i>It's not what you say about
Drew. It's what you don't say.</i>

08:01.341 --> 08:03.176
Maybe you're not listening.

08:03.259 --> 08:05.219
Oh, yes, I am.

08:05.261 --> 08:07.263
<i>Give him whatever he wants.</i>

08:07.346 --> 08:12.184
There's not an ounce of excitement,
not a... whisper of a thrill.

08:12.226 --> 08:16.104
And this relationship has all the
passion of a pair of titmice.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.565
<i>I want you to get
swept away out there.</i>

08:18.607 --> 08:21.484
I want you to levitate.
I want you to...

08:21.568 --> 08:23.945
sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish.

08:24.028 --> 08:26.781
- Oh, that's all.
- Yeah. Be deliriously happy,

08:26.864 --> 08:29.241
or at least
leave yourself open to be.

08:30.409 --> 08:32.995
Okay.

08:33.078 --> 08:35.581
"Be deliriously happy. "
I shall, uh...

08:35.664 --> 08:37.874
I shall do my utmost.

08:41.586 --> 08:44.087
I know it's a cornball thing.

08:45.173 --> 08:47.800
But love is passion,

08:47.884 --> 08:49.802
obsession,

08:49.885 --> 08:52.596
someone
you can't live without.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.474
<i>I say, fall head over heels.</i>

08:55.557 --> 09:00.270
Find someone you can love like crazy and
who will love you the same way back.

09:00.353 --> 09:05.274
How do you find him? Well, you forget
your head, and you listen to your heart.

09:05.358 --> 09:07.276
And I'm not hearing any heart.

09:07.360 --> 09:12.239
<i>'Cause the truth is, honey, there's no
sense living your life without this.</i>

09:12.281 --> 09:16.576
To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love,

09:16.618 --> 09:19.746
well, you haven't lived
a life at all.

09:21.456 --> 09:26.085
<i>But you have to try, 'cause if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived.</i>

09:27.170 --> 09:29.797
Bravo!

09:29.839 --> 09:31.799
Oh, you're tough.

09:34.676 --> 09:37.387
I'm sorry. Okay.

09:37.471 --> 09:40.640
Give it to me again,
but the short version this time.

09:40.682 --> 09:43.476
Okay. Stay open.

09:43.560 --> 09:46.813
Who knows?
Lightning could strike.

09:48.689 --> 09:52.484
Yeah?

09:52.526 --> 09:54.486
Yeah.

10:03.578 --> 10:06.831
<i>What do you think?
Is it just the executive committee,</i>

10:06.914 --> 10:08.916
or are you guys gonna use me?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.044
Quince, man, thanks for the offer,
but it's all set for just me and Bill.

10:12.127 --> 10:16.923
More people might...
I know. I know, gum up the works.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.593
"I want you to get swept away. "

10:19.676 --> 10:20.545
Huh?

10:20.546 --> 10:22.428
I was just sayin' to Quince
that we won't need him until...

10:22.429 --> 10:24.389
- Did you hear something?
- Yeah, but I was just sayin' to Quince...

10:24.472 --> 10:26.891
- No, no, no. Not you.
- What's the matter, Daddy?

10:30.603 --> 10:33.188
Nothing. I'm sorry.
"I want you to levitate.

10:33.272 --> 10:36.733
I want you to sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish. "

10:37.984 --> 10:41.154
- "Dance like a dervish"?
- Daddy, what is it?

10:42.655 --> 10:45.700
Nothing, I'm just talking
to myself. You know me.

10:45.783 --> 10:48.244
No, I've never known you
to talk to yourself.

10:48.286 --> 10:51.455
Oh, well, can I give you a lift?

10:51.539 --> 10:54.525
No, I'm gonna catch a cab.
Listen, are you okay?

10:54.526 --> 10:55.226
Yeah.

10:55.230 --> 10:58.253
Got my garters on, my ears
pricked... ready for action.

10:58.295 --> 11:00.297
Okay. Well...
Go get 'em, Pops.

11:00.380 --> 11:02.799
You're damn right.
Okay.

11:06.094 --> 11:09.597
<i>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>

11:09.680 --> 11:11.640
<i>Oh, haven't heard
that one before.</i>

11:11.682 --> 11:14.476
<i>I'm sorry. I had to say it.</i>

11:14.560 --> 11:17.521
<i>- Honey? Honey?
- Hi, George.</i>

11:17.604 --> 11:21.358
Honey, you have to go on.

11:21.441 --> 11:23.651
Okay? There's a time to sow
and a time to reap.

11:23.735 --> 11:25.987
You have to sow.

11:26.028 --> 11:28.447
<i>Sorry. Excuse me.</i>

11:28.531 --> 11:30.449
No, I liked him.
I don't like him anymore.

11:30.533 --> 11:32.785
<i>'Cause you're my honey.</i>

11:32.868 --> 11:34.828
Someone messes with you,
they mess with me.

11:34.912 --> 11:38.373
That's it. I'm on a plane in a
heartbeat. You let me know.

11:38.415 --> 11:42.502
Yep, when I get my phone in,
you're my first call. I promise.

11:42.544 --> 11:45.630
Hit the books, get the degree. One day
we'll be hanging out a shingle together.

11:45.713 --> 11:47.840
How's that?
Mmm? Okay.

11:47.882 --> 11:51.093
You all right?
Yes.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.762
<i>You bet. Be strong.</i>

11:53.846 --> 11:56.014
<i>I love you. Bye-bye.</i>

12:12.154 --> 12:14.656
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12:19.077 --> 12:21.037
I was talkin' kind of loud there.
I'm sorry.

12:21.079 --> 12:24.040
Oh, not at all.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.335
It was fascinating.

12:28.753 --> 12:30.713
Yeah, what was fascinating
about it?

12:30.754 --> 12:33.632
Um...
You and, uh, "honey"?

12:37.469 --> 12:39.554
- It's my kid sister.
- Oh.

12:41.056 --> 12:42.974
And she just broke up with her
boyfriend and was thinking...

12:43.057 --> 12:45.309
about dropping out
of law school.

12:45.393 --> 12:48.980
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, nothing to be sorry about.

12:49.063 --> 12:51.300
That's the way it is with
men and women, isn't it?

12:52.201 --> 12:53.201
What's the way?

12:53.233 --> 12:55.235
Nothing lasts.

12:55.319 --> 12:57.446
Oh. Yeah, I agree.

12:57.487 --> 12:59.656
Really? Why?

13:01.825 --> 13:04.410
No, I'm interested.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.205
I was just trying
to be agreeable.

13:10.291 --> 13:13.877
Okay. All right.
I was sharpshooting.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.422
<i>- Oh.
- No, just that "nothing lasts" stuff.</i>

13:17.506 --> 13:19.841
<i>That was the problem with Honey's guy.
He didn't know what he wanted.</i>

13:19.925 --> 13:23.052
So, he's fooling around,
and she catches him at it.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.179
You know, like one girlfriend
isn't enough for him.

13:27.473 --> 13:30.768
- So, you're a one-girl guy.
- Yes, I am.

13:32.436 --> 13:34.354
<i>- That's right.
- Right.</i>

13:35.772 --> 13:37.691
Looking for her
right now, actually.

13:37.774 --> 13:40.777
<i>Mmm. Who knows?
You might be her.</i>

13:40.860 --> 13:43.112
<i>No, don't laugh.
I just got into town.</i>

13:43.196 --> 13:45.323
I got the new job.

13:45.406 --> 13:47.658
I'm trying to get
into this apartment.

13:51.495 --> 13:53.831
Anyway,
so you're a doctor.

13:53.872 --> 13:55.832
Mmm.
How'd you know?

13:55.874 --> 13:58.418
'Cause everyone's
a doctor around here.

13:58.502 --> 14:03.590
This apartment building... Everyone's
in green slippers, the green pajamas.

14:03.673 --> 14:05.591
The guy I'm waiting for
to vacate...

14:05.675 --> 14:07.927
- ... doctor.
- He's a doctor.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.846
What kind of doctor?

14:10.888 --> 14:13.015
I'm a resident...
internal medicine.

14:14.475 --> 14:16.393
So, if I needed a doctor,
you could be it.

14:16.476 --> 14:18.728
I could be her. Yeah.

14:18.812 --> 14:20.814
You could be... her.

14:20.897 --> 14:22.816
Uh-huh.

14:24.192 --> 14:26.360
Yeah, I could.

14:29.321 --> 14:32.908
<i>- I'm-I'm working at the hospital, so...
- I see.</i>

14:32.992 --> 14:35.911
<i>This is my lucky day.
I just get in the big, bad city,</i>

14:35.994 --> 14:38.371
not only do I find a doctor,
but a beautiful woman, as well.

14:43.626 --> 14:45.545
Do you mind me saying that?

14:45.628 --> 14:48.005
Oh... No, of course.
No, it's fine.

14:48.089 --> 14:50.049
It's fine.
It's just...

14:50.091 --> 14:52.718
Listen, could I
buy you a cup of coffee?

14:54.970 --> 14:58.349
<i>I have some patients coming in,
so I should probably...</i>

14:58.350 --> 14:59.450
<i>- ... get goin'.
- Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:59.451 --> 15:01.259
I gotta get to the apartment
and get off to work.

15:01.260 --> 15:01.960
<i>Yeah.</i>

15:01.961 --> 15:03.778
But I'd still like to have
another cup of coffee.

15:05.396 --> 15:07.732
- Um...
- Would you let me do that?

15:07.815 --> 15:12.403
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Deal.

15:13.862 --> 15:15.781
Mmm.

15:39.177 --> 15:41.513
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.
- Morning, Jennifer.

15:41.554 --> 15:43.514
So, board convenes tomorrow.

15:43.556 --> 15:45.725
You'll recommend we close,
and it's a deal, right?

15:47.351 --> 15:49.937
As close as a deal could be.

15:50.020 --> 15:51.939
Olympic.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.985
Yes.

16:28.272 --> 16:30.233
Yes.

16:32.935 --> 16:36.271
- "Yes" what?
- Yes is the answer to your question.

16:36.313 --> 16:38.273
Ah.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.319
I didn't ask any question.

16:43.403 --> 16:45.321
I believe you did.

16:46.405 --> 16:49.658
Who are you?

16:51.035 --> 16:55.122
- Goddamn it. What's going on here?
- I think you know.

16:55.205 --> 16:57.958
- I don't.
- Try.

16:59.501 --> 17:03.213
"'Cause if you haven't tried,
you haven't lived. "

17:06.715 --> 17:09.175
What are you talking about?

17:09.218 --> 17:11.178
What you were talking about.

17:13.972 --> 17:15.891
Who is this guy?

17:18.351 --> 17:21.311
- Tell me who you are.
- Are you giving me orders?

17:21.354 --> 17:25.023
- No. I'm sorry, I...
- No, you're not.

17:25.108 --> 17:27.652
<i>You're trying
to handle the situation.</i>

17:27.693 --> 17:33.157
But this is the one situation
you knew you never could handle.

17:39.663 --> 17:41.581
It's enough...

17:43.458 --> 17:45.376
now.

17:58.638 --> 18:00.598
Huh?

18:04.852 --> 18:06.813
Talk to me, please.

18:07.939 --> 18:10.608
There's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.111
What do you mean?

18:16.613 --> 18:19.824
I think you know, Bill.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.376
It's kind of a pro bono job.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.419
- "Pro bono"?
- Yeah.

18:32.503 --> 18:34.755
- Meaning, doing good?
- That's me.

18:34.838 --> 18:36.798
Gonna be doing good
all your life?

18:38.717 --> 18:42.721
I know what you're saying.
It doesn't pay so well, but, I like it.

18:42.722 --> 18:43.422
Mm-hmm.

18:43.430 --> 18:47.558
<i>Eventually it'll depend
on the woman I marry, I think.</i>

18:47.642 --> 18:51.687
Maybe she'll want lots of kids,
a bigger house, better car, uh...

18:51.770 --> 18:54.314
College doesn't come cheap.
You know? I don't know.

18:55.899 --> 18:59.611
Wow. Give up what you want
for the woman you marry.

18:59.653 --> 19:01.613
<i>Hmm.</i>

19:01.654 --> 19:03.990
Yeah, you know what?
I would.

19:04.032 --> 19:05.992
<i>- Yeah?
- Gladly.</i>

19:07.368 --> 19:10.329
'Cause you make your choices,
you know?

19:10.371 --> 19:13.999
Say, you and I, if we were married,
I would... No, for an example, okay?

19:14.041 --> 19:16.543
If you and I were married, I would
want to give you what you need.

19:16.627 --> 19:19.838
That's all. I'm talking about taking
care of each other the best you can.

19:19.879 --> 19:22.715
What's wrong with taking care of a
woman? She takes care of you.

19:22.799 --> 19:25.843
You'll have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

19:25.927 --> 19:28.888
- Shoot, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.

19:29.930 --> 19:33.225
I don't know.
Lightning could strike.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.111
I've gotta go.

19:45.194 --> 19:48.606
- Yeah. Listen, did I say something wrong?
- No.

19:48.607 --> 19:51.825
- No? Sure?
- No. No. It was...

19:51.909 --> 19:54.745
It was so right, it scares me.
That's all.

19:54.828 --> 19:56.788
Just...

19:59.708 --> 20:02.085
You know, I was thinking,
I don't want you to be my doctor.

20:02.168 --> 20:06.005
I don't want you to...
examine me and...

20:06.089 --> 20:08.382
Why?

20:10.009 --> 20:11.969
Because I like you
so much.

20:21.603 --> 20:25.231
And I... I don't want
to examine you.

20:25.314 --> 20:28.859
You don't? Why not?

20:28.943 --> 20:32.529
Because I like you so much.

20:35.282 --> 20:37.993
Oh, boy. Okay.

20:38.076 --> 20:41.079
Now I gotta go, so...

20:41.162 --> 20:43.998
- Yep, understood.
- All right. All right.

20:44.040 --> 20:46.417
Fair enough. See ya.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.961
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

22:29.136 --> 22:31.430
<i>Music.</i>

22:31.472 --> 22:35.058
<i>I know how you love music, Daddy.
And I want to have music that pleases you,</i>

22:35.142 --> 22:38.728
but doesn't put a thousand
other people to sleep.

22:38.812 --> 22:42.774
I've agonized over it and finally
settled on Sidney Brown.

22:42.775 --> 22:43.475
Good.

22:43.476 --> 22:47.111
- Twenty-four men... very eclectic.
- Mm-hmm.

22:47.153 --> 22:51.282
Plus, I'm feathering in
a Latin sextet on their breaks.

22:54.493 --> 22:57.371
You haven't heard
a word I've said, have you?

22:59.789 --> 23:02.333
- What, honey? Sorry.
- Daddy.

23:02.417 --> 23:04.335
Yes.

23:05.628 --> 23:07.547
<i>Daddy?</i>

23:07.630 --> 23:10.424
<i>Mr. Parrish?</i>

23:10.508 --> 23:13.510
- Yes?
- Dinner's served.

23:15.262 --> 23:19.182
- Yeah.
- Never mind.

23:19.266 --> 23:21.184
Leave it to me.

23:27.023 --> 23:29.942
Did you miss me, Bill?

23:31.944 --> 23:33.904
Chow time, you guys.

23:35.948 --> 23:38.408
What are you looking
so provoked about?

23:39.492 --> 23:41.786
Did you miss me?

23:41.870 --> 23:44.205
It's a normal question.

23:44.289 --> 23:47.917
I missed you.
But what do I get back?

23:48.000 --> 23:50.169
"Not an ounce of excitement.

23:50.252 --> 23:52.171
"Not a whisper of a thrill.

23:53.714 --> 23:57.342
This relationship has all the
passion of a pair of titmice. "

24:00.387 --> 24:02.722
I'm waiting outside
the front door.

24:02.805 --> 24:04.724
<i>Did you speak to the governor?</i>

24:04.807 --> 24:07.518
- He's coming.
- And his wife?

24:07.602 --> 24:09.979
Yeah, unfortunately.

24:10.020 --> 24:13.148
I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo
benefit. It was better than Seconal.

24:13.232 --> 24:16.985
I'm waiting outside
the front door, Bill.

24:18.612 --> 24:21.072
Won't someone let me in?

24:22.574 --> 24:24.492
Lillian?

24:29.288 --> 24:31.790
- Is there somebody at the front door?
- I didn't hear a ring, sir.

24:31.874 --> 24:33.834
Have a look, would you, please?

24:34.877 --> 24:36.837
<i>What about the mayor?</i>

24:36.878 --> 24:38.806
<i>He said he's going
to be there with bells on.</i>

24:38.807 --> 24:39.507
<i>Good.</i>

24:39.589 --> 24:42.050
<i>- Maybe they'll drown him out.
- Please don't be negative, Drew.</i>

24:42.133 --> 24:42.834
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

24:42.835 --> 24:46.510
We have an acceptance list
that would do the White House proud:

24:46.512 --> 24:49.932
The chairman of the F.C.C.,
the Secretary General of the U.N.,

24:50.015 --> 24:52.142
<i>- Wow.
- Nine senators,</i>

24:52.226 --> 24:57.356
<i>I don't know how many congressmen
and at least 12 of the Fortune 500.</i>

24:57.397 --> 25:00.817
- Any jocks? Hmm?
- No.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.320
No 20-game-winner, Masters champion,
someone I can talk to?

25:07.240 --> 25:10.242
You were right, Mr. Parrish.
There was a gentleman at the door.

25:10.326 --> 25:12.828
<i>He's waiting for you
in the foyer.</i>

25:15.747 --> 25:18.609
Show him into the library.
Tell him I'll be right there.

25:18.610 --> 25:19.610
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

25:19.751 --> 25:23.254
<i>I've arranged favors, silver
charm bracelets for the women,</i>

25:23.338 --> 25:25.548
<i>- Mmm.
- And platinum key chains for the men,</i>

25:25.590 --> 25:28.217
all engraved "W.P."

25:28.259 --> 25:32.137
But now I'm thinking of scrubbing them.
They seem so ordinary.

25:32.221 --> 25:34.598
<i>Are they ordinary?</i>

25:34.681 --> 25:36.600
<i>Do they seem that way
to you, Daddy?</i>

25:37.684 --> 25:39.603
I don't know.

25:39.686 --> 25:42.438
I don't know.
I, uh...

25:49.945 --> 25:52.072
Let me see.

25:52.114 --> 25:54.074
I don't think they're ordinary.

25:54.116 --> 25:56.243
I think they're great.

25:56.326 --> 25:58.286
I love key chains.

26:15.093 --> 26:17.012
Hello?

26:21.099 --> 26:23.017
Anyone here?

26:26.562 --> 26:29.815
- I said, is anyone here?
- Quiet down.

26:36.780 --> 26:39.658
- Where are you?
- I'm here.

26:44.203 --> 26:46.706
What is this, a joke, right?

26:46.747 --> 26:49.583
Some kind of elaborate
practical joke?

26:52.586 --> 26:56.715
At my 40th reunion,
we delivered a casket...

26:56.798 --> 27:00.010
to the class president's
hotel room and, uh...

27:00.093 --> 27:02.053
Quiet.

27:08.726 --> 27:11.979
Where are you going, Bill?

27:12.062 --> 27:14.314
I, uh...

27:14.398 --> 27:17.234
The great Bill Parrish
at a loss for words?

27:17.317 --> 27:22.238
The man from whose lips fall "rapture"
and "passion" and "obsession"?

27:22.280 --> 27:26.242
All those admonitions about
being " deliriously happy,

27:26.284 --> 27:29.036
that there is no sense
living your life without. "

27:29.078 --> 27:31.038
All the sparks and energy
you give off,

27:31.080 --> 27:35.292
the rosy advice you dispense
in round, pear-shaped tones.

27:41.006 --> 27:43.132
What the hell is this?

27:52.391 --> 27:54.309
Who are you?

27:56.270 --> 27:59.064
Just think of millenniums
multiplied by eons...

27:59.147 --> 28:01.733
compounded by time without end.

28:01.816 --> 28:03.943
I've been around that long.

28:04.027 --> 28:08.823
But it's only recently that your
affairs here have piqued my interest.

28:08.864 --> 28:11.200
<i>Call it boredom.</i>

28:11.283 --> 28:13.994
<i>The natural curiosity of me,
the most lasting...</i>

28:14.036 --> 28:18.582
<i>and significant element in
existence, has come to see you.</i>

28:20.375 --> 28:22.293
About what?

28:23.545 --> 28:27.131
I want to have a look around
before I take you.

28:29.050 --> 28:31.010
Take me where?

28:32.261 --> 28:36.223
It requires competence,
wisdom and experience.

28:36.264 --> 28:39.935
All those things they say
about you in testimonials.

28:40.018 --> 28:41.978
And you're the one.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.857
<i>- The one to do what?
- Show me around,</i>

28:46.899 --> 28:49.568
be my guide.

28:49.652 --> 28:52.863
And in return, you get...

28:55.240 --> 28:57.200
I get what?

28:58.910 --> 29:01.037
Time:

29:01.121 --> 29:04.290
Minutes, days, weeks.

29:04.374 --> 29:06.292
Let's not get encumbered
by detail.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.336
<i>What matters is
that I stay interested.</i>

29:15.592 --> 29:17.594
Yes.

29:19.930 --> 29:21.890
"Yes" what?

29:21.931 --> 29:25.059
<i>Yes is the answer
to your question.</i>

29:28.396 --> 29:30.314
<i>- What question?
- Oh, Bill.</i>

29:30.397 --> 29:33.150
Come on. The question.

29:33.233 --> 29:37.112
The question you've been asking
yourself with increased regularity,

29:37.195 --> 29:40.323
at odd moments, panting through
the extra game of handball,

29:40.407 --> 29:42.534
<i>when you ran for the plane
in Delhi,</i>

29:42.617 --> 29:46.162
<i>when you sat up in bed last night and
hit the floor in the office this morning.</i>

29:46.245 --> 29:49.832
The question that is in
the back of your throat,

29:49.915 --> 29:52.334
choking the blood
to your brain,

29:52.418 --> 29:58.215
ringing in your ears over and
over as you put it to yourself.

30:00.467 --> 30:02.552
<i>- "The question. "
- Yes, Bill.</i>

30:02.635 --> 30:04.554
"The question. "

30:10.017 --> 30:11.977
The question.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.359
Am I going to die?

30:29.368 --> 30:31.328
Yes.

30:37.709 --> 30:39.794
Am I dreaming this?

30:39.878 --> 30:41.796
Are you a dream?

30:43.047 --> 30:44.966
I'm not a dream.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.052
<i>You're coming to take me?</i>

30:49.553 --> 30:51.472
What is that?

30:51.555 --> 30:53.474
And who the hell are you?

31:24.877 --> 31:26.796
You are...

31:28.005 --> 31:30.174
Yes?

31:34.636 --> 31:36.763
Who am I?

31:46.481 --> 31:48.399
Death.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.197
You're Death?

31:56.823 --> 31:59.451
Yes.

32:05.081 --> 32:08.542
- Death.
- That's me.

32:10.794 --> 32:12.713
You're not Death.
You're just a kid in a suit.

32:12.796 --> 32:15.716
The suit came with
the body I took.

32:15.799 --> 32:18.593
Let me ask your opinion.

32:18.677 --> 32:20.595
Do I blend in?

32:25.516 --> 32:27.893
You want me
to be your guide?

32:27.977 --> 32:30.020
You fill the bill, Bill.

32:30.104 --> 32:32.064
- I do?
- Mmm.

32:33.857 --> 32:35.776
Will you be staying long?

32:35.859 --> 32:37.861
We should hope quite a while.

32:39.738 --> 32:41.656
And then?

32:48.245 --> 32:50.206
It's over.

32:51.582 --> 32:54.126
It's over.

32:54.209 --> 32:56.795
<i>Mr. Parrish?</i>

32:56.878 --> 32:58.839
Will the gentleman be staying
for dinner, sir?

33:00.757 --> 33:02.634
Yes.

33:06.762 --> 33:08.681
Thank you.

33:12.601 --> 33:14.520
This is crazy.

33:16.897 --> 33:18.815
You're not gonna
eat dinner with us.

33:18.899 --> 33:22.360
No, I am eating dinner with you...
and your family.

33:22.443 --> 33:24.362
And that is what we're doing.

33:24.445 --> 33:28.616
It's not open
for discussion, nothing is.

33:28.699 --> 33:31.285
Don't you understand?

33:34.204 --> 33:36.540
Yeah.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.792
Good.

33:38.834 --> 33:40.794
Now lead the way.

33:42.086 --> 33:44.797
Bill,

33:44.881 --> 33:46.841
lead the way.

33:54.306 --> 33:59.144
- Excuse me, may I say something?
- Yes, of course.

33:59.185 --> 34:01.438
Well, it just occurred
to me, if, uh...

34:01.521 --> 34:03.356
Speak up, please.

34:03.439 --> 34:08.319
When I introduce you,
if I say who you are,

34:08.360 --> 34:11.322
I don't think anyone
will stay for dinner.

34:12.364 --> 34:14.366
Then don't.

34:14.408 --> 34:16.576
Here's another possibility.

34:16.659 --> 34:20.621
It's a little last minute,
but tell me what you think.

34:20.705 --> 34:22.623
Kaleidoscopes.

34:23.833 --> 34:25.835
Little gold kaleidoscopes.

34:25.918 --> 34:28.754
Some German company went kerplunk,
and Tiffany's picked all these things up,

34:28.838 --> 34:31.715
and they're perfect
party favors.

34:31.757 --> 34:34.927
Okay, they're not personalized or
anything. They're just winter scenes...

34:35.010 --> 34:36.928
dachshunds, snowflakes.

34:40.681 --> 34:42.600
Hi there.

34:44.936 --> 34:46.896
Hello.

34:48.022 --> 34:51.275
Sorry to have...
stepped away for so long.

34:51.358 --> 34:54.527
This is a friend of mine
I asked to drop by.

34:54.610 --> 34:58.031
We got to talking
and stuff, and, uh...

34:59.783 --> 35:01.701
He's gonna join us for dinner.

35:04.370 --> 35:07.164
- Great.
- How nice to meet you.

35:07.248 --> 35:10.376
And wouldn't it be nicer if my
father would introduce you?

35:11.669 --> 35:13.629
How nice to meet you.

35:15.464 --> 35:19.134
Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my daughter,
Allison, and her husband, Quince,

35:19.217 --> 35:22.011
<i>and Drew, my number one,
works with me.</i>

35:23.638 --> 35:25.932
Daddy, does your friend
have a name?

35:25.973 --> 35:30.603
- A name?
- Something he goes by?

35:32.980 --> 35:35.649
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
This is, uh...

35:35.732 --> 35:37.651
This is, um...

35:37.734 --> 35:40.779
- Daddy, come on. A name.
- Bill, the suspense is killing me.

35:40.862 --> 35:43.823
I'm sorry. It's, uh...
It's gone right out of my head. Um...

35:45.992 --> 35:49.412
I'm sorry. This is... Joe.

35:49.495 --> 35:52.831
<i>- Joe. I love that name.
- Just plain Joe.</i>

35:52.873 --> 35:55.542
Me too. Hey, buddy.

35:56.960 --> 36:00.797
- Is there any more to it?
- What do you mean?

36:00.880 --> 36:03.883
Like "Smith" or "Jones" or...

36:08.804 --> 36:11.974
<i>- Black.
- Oh, at last.</i>

36:12.057 --> 36:15.269
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
- Hey, hey, Joe Black.

36:15.352 --> 36:18.313
Won 15, lost 2 for the
Brooklyn Dodgers, 1952.

36:18.396 --> 36:20.315
<i>I'm king of my rotisserie league.</i>

36:20.398 --> 36:23.193
- Are you?
- Yeah, he is.

36:24.736 --> 36:27.154
Shall we sit down?

36:27.238 --> 36:29.156
Right there.

37:18.116 --> 37:19.594
Have we met?

37:20.704 --> 37:24.290
- He's from out of town.
- How long you here for, Joe?

37:25.333 --> 37:28.085
As long as it takes.

37:30.212 --> 37:34.133
<i>- You and Bill, you old friends?
- No.</i>

37:37.969 --> 37:40.472
No, thank you.

37:40.513 --> 37:43.057
I have one, thank you.

37:43.141 --> 37:45.727
<i>I get the feeling you've
done some business before.</i>

37:45.728 --> 37:46.828
I got it.

37:48.354 --> 37:50.397
Have you done
some business before?

37:52.024 --> 37:54.234
We have an arrangement now.

37:58.071 --> 38:01.074
What side of the industry
did you say you were on?

38:01.157 --> 38:03.743
I didn't say.

38:05.203 --> 38:07.163
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill.

38:07.205 --> 38:10.166
<i>I have a feeling you guys got
the broad strokes already.</i>

38:10.249 --> 38:12.209
You need any help
with the details?

38:14.753 --> 38:17.089
I'm sorry, business at dinner.

38:18.924 --> 38:22.969
- Forgive me for being so rude.
- Certainly.

38:23.052 --> 38:25.012
<i>Hi, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

38:25.096 --> 38:27.316
I had to have dinner
with my department chief.

38:27.317 --> 38:28.317
You ate?

38:28.500 --> 38:31.185
I'm here, aren't I? I wouldn't
miss a loose ends meeting.

38:31.268 --> 38:34.855
What's on the table for discussion?
Party favors, flowers...

38:34.938 --> 38:36.857
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

38:36.940 --> 38:38.859
- Hello.
- Hi, Drew.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.240
What are you doing here?

38:46.282 --> 38:49.035
You know each other?

38:52.538 --> 38:54.998
We've met.

38:56.541 --> 38:59.211
<i>This morning,
the Corinth Coffee Shop.</i>

38:59.294 --> 39:01.963
He was, uh...
He was looking for a doctor.

39:02.046 --> 39:05.800
<i>Well, I guess he's found one.</i>

39:05.883 --> 39:07.843
Joe, you do get around.

39:07.927 --> 39:10.679
<i>- That's your name?
- And isn't it a lovely one?</i>

39:10.763 --> 39:14.641
So sturdy, so straight.
Stop it.

39:14.725 --> 39:19.104
<i>Incidentally, Joe,
where are you staying?</i>

39:20.355 --> 39:23.483
- Here.
- You're staying here?

39:23.566 --> 39:29.113
- In this house?
- Yes, in this house.

39:29.155 --> 39:33.200
<i>Great. Great. Great.</i>

39:33.283 --> 39:35.994
Will that hold you, Joe?

39:36.078 --> 39:38.246
Incidentally, Joe what?

39:38.330 --> 39:40.457
Black.

39:40.540 --> 39:42.500
This is fun.

39:42.584 --> 39:45.336
Yes. Yes, Quince, it is.

39:45.420 --> 39:47.630
So, what are you doing here, Joe?

39:55.679 --> 39:58.306
Cat got your tongue?

39:58.390 --> 40:01.101
You weren't so silent this morning.

40:02.810 --> 40:05.521
This morning, yes.

40:07.356 --> 40:09.233
I wasn't quite myself.

40:10.776 --> 40:15.280
Well, it's a shame whoever you were
couldn't be here tonight.

40:15.364 --> 40:17.407
<i>Cut it out, Susan.
We've gotta talk.</i>

40:17.491 --> 40:20.118
<i>Busy day tomorrow, everybody.</i>

40:21.745 --> 40:24.414
Joe, let's go.

40:24.497 --> 40:26.457
Yes.

40:35.299 --> 40:38.635
That stuff between
you and Susan threw me.

40:38.677 --> 40:40.637
Threw you? Where?

40:40.679 --> 40:42.639
Shook me up.

40:44.057 --> 40:46.726
I mean, how is it that you happened
to meet my daughter?

40:46.809 --> 40:48.936
I didn't meet her.

40:49.020 --> 40:50.980
The young man I took met her.

40:51.021 --> 40:54.483
That is, the fellow she encountered in
the coffee shop this morning.

40:55.901 --> 40:57.819
What happened to him?

40:57.903 --> 41:00.864
I needed a body, Bill.

41:04.742 --> 41:06.661
So,

41:09.997 --> 41:11.915
come in.

41:14.418 --> 41:20.173
Uh, bathroom,
tub, towels, sauna,

41:20.215 --> 41:23.301
chairs, lamps, bed.

41:39.274 --> 41:41.901
Well, if there is anything else,

41:43.987 --> 41:46.405
- don't hesitate.
- I won't.

43:01.307 --> 43:03.810
- I can try.
- Will she be available next week?

43:03.851 --> 43:05.812
I don't know.

43:07.521 --> 43:09.482
Yes, sir?

43:09.523 --> 43:12.359
Hello. I'm Joe Black.

43:12.443 --> 43:14.361
It's nice meeting you.

43:14.444 --> 43:16.697
Yes, of course, Mr. Black, sir.

43:16.780 --> 43:19.199
A pleasure.

43:19.282 --> 43:21.201
Eh...

43:22.285 --> 43:24.579
What is that?

43:24.662 --> 43:26.956
- You mean this, sir?
- Yes.

43:27.039 --> 43:30.501
It's, uh, Laura Scudder's
peanut butter, sir.

43:32.544 --> 43:34.505
You like it?

43:34.546 --> 43:37.174
Well, I would say,
in my opinion,

43:37.257 --> 43:41.302
it's right up there
with Jif and Skippy.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.304
Could I offer you
a taste, sir?

43:45.056 --> 43:46.974
- Yes.
- All right.

44:21.172 --> 44:23.132
Do you fancy it, sir?

44:25.510 --> 44:28.220
More?

44:28.304 --> 44:30.222
Right.

44:38.939 --> 44:40.857
Mmm.

44:43.526 --> 44:46.320
Mmm.

44:46.404 --> 44:49.240
You're a peanut butter man
now, eh, sir?

44:51.325 --> 44:53.994
Yes, I believe I am.

44:55.245 --> 44:57.747
I thoroughly enjoy
this peanut butter.

44:59.165 --> 45:01.334
And I thoroughly enjoyed
meeting you all.

45:02.710 --> 45:05.671
- I'll be moseying on.
- Right, sir.

45:37.534 --> 45:39.452
What are you doing here?

45:41.913 --> 45:44.332
I'm lost.

45:46.667 --> 45:48.794
I can't seem
to escape you today.

45:48.878 --> 45:52.548
<i>- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.</i>

46:12.316 --> 46:14.276
Would you hand me
one of those?

46:30.332 --> 46:34.920
You must have something very...
big going on with my father.

46:35.003 --> 46:36.963
- Big?
- Yeah.

46:38.131 --> 46:40.508
You appear at his side
out of the blue,

46:40.592 --> 46:42.594
stay at his house,
have dinner with his family.

46:42.677 --> 46:46.681
That's, uh,
practically a first.

46:46.764 --> 46:50.142
You're in the red-hot center
of big business,

46:50.184 --> 46:52.144
and I thought you were
just a regular Joe.

46:53.687 --> 46:57.691
- I am Joe.
- Not the one that I met this morning.

46:57.774 --> 47:02.070
Hitting on me in as nice a way as
I've been hit on in a long time.

47:02.153 --> 47:06.115
The second that you found out
I was my father's daughter, you, uh...

47:06.199 --> 47:10.953
Well, you acted like a stranger.

47:11.036 --> 47:13.455
That is not my intention.

47:15.207 --> 47:17.626
What are your intentions?

47:17.709 --> 47:21.421
Huh?
I mean, just to, uh,

47:21.504 --> 47:24.882
make little dramas in coffee shops,
turn a woman's head?

47:24.924 --> 47:27.760
I don't mind admitting
that my-my head was turned.

47:27.843 --> 47:30.221
I- I liked it.

47:30.304 --> 47:35.225
But, well, ten hours later,
I feel like a fool.

47:36.310 --> 47:38.728
I just don't get it. I don't.

47:38.812 --> 47:41.106
You, my father, here in this house.
It's, uh...

47:41.189 --> 47:45.151
It's upsetting me, and I...

47:45.234 --> 47:49.196
What happened to that sweet guy
from the coffee shop?

47:50.447 --> 47:52.408
Who are you, anyway?

47:53.826 --> 47:57.829
And... what are you eating?

47:59.247 --> 48:01.207
Peanut butter.

48:04.002 --> 48:05.920
Hmm.

48:06.003 --> 48:07.922
But it's gone now.

48:13.719 --> 48:15.637
Wh... No. Please.

48:17.764 --> 48:19.734
You act like you've never
had peanut butter before.

48:19.735 --> 48:20.735
I haven't.

48:22.393 --> 48:25.146
- What kind of childhood did you have?
- Do you love Drew?

48:25.229 --> 48:27.356
Excuse me?

48:27.440 --> 48:30.401
When you put your mouth
to his, it seemed a frequent thing.

48:33.153 --> 48:35.280
Drew is none of your business,

48:35.364 --> 48:38.033
and neither is where
I put my mouth.

48:38.116 --> 48:40.410
I'm sorry.
Do you live here?

48:40.493 --> 48:43.496
No, Joe, I'm swimming here
and now I'm going home.

48:43.580 --> 48:46.791
Yes, I think what
I'm trying to say is,

48:46.874 --> 48:49.502
I would like it
if we were friends.

48:49.585 --> 48:52.212
I've got plenty of friends.

48:52.296 --> 48:54.965
I don't have any.

48:57.175 --> 48:59.552
Well, I can see why.

49:06.559 --> 49:08.936
I didn't mean
to offend you at dinner.

49:09.019 --> 49:11.355
I'm sometimes...

49:11.397 --> 49:15.234
not quite at home
around people.

49:17.152 --> 49:20.613
I get busy doing, uh,
what it is I do.

49:20.697 --> 49:24.701
And I don't seem
to have developed...

49:27.745 --> 49:29.914
Yes?

49:34.001 --> 49:39.798
I have a certain function to perform,
and it seems to take up most of my time.

49:41.132 --> 49:45.094
But sometimes I...
speculate...

49:47.597 --> 49:49.932
that I haven't
left room for...

49:52.893 --> 49:55.270
anything else.

49:58.773 --> 50:00.692
Hmm.

50:02.193 --> 50:04.529
I'm sorry to say
I know what you mean.

50:17.541 --> 50:19.501
Well, um...

50:22.462 --> 50:24.380
Good night, Joe.

50:24.464 --> 50:26.883
Yes.

50:26.966 --> 50:29.760
Good night to you, Susan.

50:32.137 --> 50:34.681
- Morning, Madeline.
- Oh, good morning, Mr. Parrish.

50:34.765 --> 50:37.309
- Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

50:37.392 --> 50:39.352
Good.

50:56.702 --> 50:59.037
Morning.

50:59.079 --> 51:01.414
Good morning, Bill.

51:07.003 --> 51:09.672
What's on the docket for today?

51:09.755 --> 51:14.384
- Docket?
- Hmm, yes. What shall we do?

51:14.468 --> 51:18.346
- Well, I have to go to work, and...
- Splendid. I'll join you.

51:18.388 --> 51:20.390
Oh.

51:20.432 --> 51:23.017
Would you like to ride or walk?

51:23.059 --> 51:26.646
Walk. I wish to see the world.

51:26.729 --> 51:31.358
This is crazy.
This is the left field thing of all time.

51:31.400 --> 51:34.945
I, uh... I don't know
if I can get through this.

51:35.028 --> 51:38.240
- What do I do? What do I tell my family?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

51:38.323 --> 51:41.868
As far as your family's concerned,
uh, I wouldn't say anything.

51:41.951 --> 51:44.912
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

51:44.954 --> 51:49.542
Hmm. It felt as if I was
being treated like a person.

51:49.625 --> 51:51.585
Yes, Joe this, Joe that.

51:51.627 --> 51:55.797
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

51:55.881 --> 52:00.927
No passion or rapture or any of these mighty
things you're so intent on imparting.

52:00.969 --> 52:03.096
But I am certain,

52:03.137 --> 52:06.265
should you say who I am,
our adventure would end abruptly.

52:06.349 --> 52:08.809
Mm-hmm.

52:12.187 --> 52:15.232
And I did so enjoy your family.

52:17.692 --> 52:21.488
What about my family? This
adventure involves only me, right?

52:21.571 --> 52:24.490
What do you mean?

52:27.827 --> 52:31.038
I'll tell you what. You promise
this undertaking of yours...

52:31.121 --> 52:33.082
involves only me and, uh...

52:33.165 --> 52:35.584
And what?

52:35.667 --> 52:38.336
- I won't tell anyone who you are.
- Sounds fair enough.

52:38.420 --> 52:41.673
- Good.
- Is it a deal?

52:41.756 --> 52:44.425
- A deal?
- Yeah.

52:44.509 --> 52:47.511
You give your word;
I give mine that we'll do what we say.

52:47.595 --> 52:48.300
Mm-hmm.

52:48.301 --> 52:51.472
It is a truth exchanged
between two people.

52:51.473 --> 52:53.559
- Bill?
- What?

52:53.642 --> 52:56.770
You have a deal. Ow!

53:03.359 --> 53:05.945
That's great.

53:08.739 --> 53:10.908
Great.

53:10.950 --> 53:14.661
You know, I got to thinking.

53:14.745 --> 53:18.915
With you here
and seemingly occupied,

53:18.957 --> 53:22.001
how's your work going,
I mean, elsewhere?

53:22.085 --> 53:25.922
While you were shaving this morning,
you weren't just shaving.

53:26.005 --> 53:29.341
- What do you mean?
- You were hatching ideas,

53:29.425 --> 53:32.386
making plans,
arriving at decisions, right?

53:32.469 --> 53:34.429
Yeah, I guess so.

53:34.471 --> 53:38.225
So you understand the concept.
While part of you is busy doing one thing,

53:38.308 --> 53:40.137
another part of you is doing another,

53:40.138 --> 53:42.838
perhaps even attending
to the problems of your work.

53:42.979 --> 53:45.857
- Correct?
- Of course.

53:45.940 --> 53:49.610
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

53:49.693 --> 53:52.905
Now multiply that by infinity,
take that to the depths of forever,

53:52.988 --> 53:55.657
and you still will barely have a
glimpse of what I'm talking about.

54:02.580 --> 54:05.124
- Joe?
- Yes, Bill?

54:07.835 --> 54:10.254
How about giving a guy a break?

54:10.337 --> 54:12.297
Make an exception?

54:12.381 --> 54:15.801
- Well, there's one to every rule.
- Not this.

54:15.842 --> 54:18.845
And call my family. I'd like them
to have dinner with me tonight.

54:18.929 --> 54:22.182
Didn't the family
get together last night?

54:22.265 --> 54:26.644
- Jennifer.
- Of course, Mr. Parrish, right away.

54:26.686 --> 54:28.405
Uh, perhaps you'd like
to wait in my office.

54:28.406 --> 54:29.406
No.

54:29.688 --> 54:33.567
What I'm trying to say is this is a board
meeting and you're not a member.

54:33.650 --> 54:37.320
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.

54:37.404 --> 54:40.490
Nice to meet you.

54:40.573 --> 54:42.534
Morning.

54:42.617 --> 54:44.577
Good morning.

54:47.038 --> 54:49.039
Thank you. Eddie.

54:49.123 --> 54:51.458
Uh, this is Joe Black.

54:51.542 --> 54:52.846
He's a...

54:53.947 --> 54:56.447
- ... personal associate of mine, and, uh...
- Hello, Quince.

54:56.630 --> 54:59.090
<i>- Hey.
- He'll be joining us this morning.</i>

54:59.174 --> 55:03.428
<i>I know this is unusual,
and my apologies, and, uh...</i>

55:03.511 --> 55:06.389
<i>Drew, carry on.
It's nice to see you.</i>

55:06.472 --> 55:09.642
Didn't expect you, but, uh...

55:09.725 --> 55:11.769
certainly you can't get
enough of a good thing.

55:11.852 --> 55:15.397
- Thank you.
- Joe, would you like to sit there?

55:27.074 --> 55:29.034
Okay.

55:29.118 --> 55:33.580
<i>Uh, the Board of Parrish Communications
is hereby called to order.</i>

55:33.664 --> 55:35.624
Our sole order of...

55:41.379 --> 55:44.132
Our s...

55:51.347 --> 55:54.016
Our sole order
of business today is a, uh...

55:54.099 --> 55:57.269
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

55:57.352 --> 55:58.771
<i>And I think Bill...</i>

55:58.772 --> 56:00.912
Do you have any more
of these delicious cookies?

56:00.913 --> 56:02.607
<i>The jelly ones?</i>

56:02.649 --> 56:04.901
<i>Mmm, and a cup of tea.</i>

56:04.984 --> 56:09.905
With milk, I think.
I'd like to try it English style. Yes.

56:09.989 --> 56:11.949
<i>A cup of tea with milk, please.</i>

56:11.991 --> 56:14.159
Is there anything else, Mr. Black?

56:14.243 --> 56:16.620
- How about some water?
- Why, yes, thank you.

56:16.661 --> 56:18.622
<i>- Hot or cold?
- Cold.</i>

56:18.663 --> 56:22.625
- And a glass?
- Mmm.

56:26.671 --> 56:31.342
Uh, to review. We're really crossing
the T's and dotting the I's here.

56:31.383 --> 56:35.262
Uh, Bill had a great and conclusive meeting
yesterday with John Bontecou,

56:35.345 --> 56:38.306
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

56:41.017 --> 56:45.605
Um, thank you.
Drew, um...

56:46.898 --> 56:49.191
Yeah.

56:49.275 --> 56:52.194
I did enjoy, or rather
I was interested...

56:52.236 --> 56:56.656
in meeting
John Bontecou yesterday,

56:56.782 --> 56:58.909
and, um...

57:00.493 --> 57:05.331
Impressive, I suppose.

57:05.415 --> 57:07.333
But, uh...

57:11.253 --> 57:13.755
But...

57:13.797 --> 57:17.259
It did get me to thinking.

57:18.969 --> 57:23.181
<i>See, I started in this business
because this is what I wanted to do.</i>

57:23.264 --> 57:27.810
I knew I wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

57:27.893 --> 57:31.188
But I also knew there was more to life
than buying something for a dollar...

57:31.272 --> 57:34.149
and selling it for two.

57:34.233 --> 57:37.736
<i>I'd hoped to create something,
something which could be...</i>

57:37.819 --> 57:40.780
held to the highest standards.

57:40.822 --> 57:44.742
And what I realized was I...

57:44.826 --> 57:48.162
I wanted to give
the news to the world.

57:48.204 --> 57:52.541
And I wanted
to give it unvarnished.

57:52.624 --> 57:57.087
Uh, the more we all know about each other,
the greater the chance we will survive.

57:57.170 --> 58:00.840
Sure, I want to make a profit.
You can't exist without one, but, uh...

58:00.924 --> 58:05.219
John Bontecou is all profit.

58:05.303 --> 58:10.182
<i>If we give him license to absorb
Parrish Communications...</i>

58:10.266 --> 58:12.309
<i>and he has his eye
on a few others after us...</i>

58:12.393 --> 58:14.686
in order to reach the world,

58:14.770 --> 58:18.690
you will have to go
through John Bontecou.

58:18.773 --> 58:20.859
And not only will you
have to pay him to do this,

58:20.942 --> 58:24.237
far more important,
you'll have to agree with him.

<i>Reporting the news is a privilege
and a responsibility.</i>

58:29.909 --> 58:33.454
And it is not exploitable.

58:33.537 --> 58:36.748
Parrish Communications
has earned this privilege.

58:36.832 --> 58:40.293
John Bontecou wants to buy it.

58:41.753 --> 58:44.505
<i>As your chairman,</i>

58:44.589 --> 58:47.091
I urge you to agree.

58:47.174 --> 58:50.302
This company is not for sale.

58:56.266 --> 58:58.768
It sounds like you're not leaving
much room for discussion.

58:58.852 --> 59:00.770
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

59:00.854 --> 59:03.273
I know. I'm sorry, I...
Looks like I'm reversing my field.

59:03.356 --> 59:05.983
That's your privilege, Bill.
But given our needs,

59:06.067 --> 59:08.819
given the absolute necessity
for growth, given the future,

59:08.903 --> 59:12.614
the truth is, joining John Bontecou is
every bit as certain as death and taxes.

59:12.698 --> 59:15.501
<i>- Death and taxes?
- Yes.</i>

59:16.284 --> 59:18.995
<i>- Death and taxes?
- Yes.</i>

59:19.079 --> 59:22.248
<i>- What an odd pairing.
- It's just a saying, Mr. Black.</i>

59:22.332 --> 59:24.917
<i>- Mmm. By whom?
- Doesn't matter.</i>

59:25.001 --> 59:28.379
Then why'd you bring it up?

59:28.462 --> 59:30.464
You're not familiar
with the phrase, "In this world,

59:30.548 --> 59:32.674
nothing is certain
but death and taxes?"

59:32.758 --> 59:35.302
<i>- Well, I am now.
- Glad I could be of some help.</i>

59:35.385 --> 59:38.597
<i>I keep regular office hours if there's any
further information you might need...</i>

59:38.638 --> 59:41.641
on sayings, common phrases,
manners of speaking.

59:41.724 --> 59:46.020
My door's wide open. The tea
I can provide, perhaps even the milk.

59:46.103 --> 59:48.189
Low fat.

59:48.272 --> 59:50.316
<i>Yeah, okay, well, uh...</i>

59:50.399 --> 59:54.153
I think we've accomplished everything we're
going to this morning. Shall we adjourn?

59:54.194 --> 59:56.456
But the matter is still on the table, Bill.

59:56.657 --> 59:57.957
Joe?

59:58.240 --> 01:00:00.825
Yes.

01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:10.251
Thank you for
the delicious cookies.

01:00:12.628 --> 01:00:15.380
Mmm.

01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:20.343
Who is that guy?

01:00:22.303 --> 01:00:24.222
So...

01:00:25.598 --> 01:00:27.975
what's the deal here?

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:31.145
You gonna be breathing down
my neck right till the very end?

01:00:31.228 --> 01:00:34.648
- I don't understand.
- I'd like to be alone for a while.

01:00:37.484 --> 01:00:41.988
- Are you sad, Bill?
- Yes, I am.

01:00:42.071 --> 01:00:44.032
Why don't you take a walk
or something, get some air?

01:00:44.115 --> 01:00:46.701
I know I'll be seeing you.

01:00:46.784 --> 01:00:50.371
Of course.

01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:53.707
Good. Now I'd like to be alone.

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:55.792
This will hold you for a while.

01:00:55.876 --> 01:00:58.545
- You know about money, don't you?
- It can't buy happiness?

01:00:58.628 --> 01:01:01.464
Yeah. Uh, Jennifer?

01:01:01.548 --> 01:01:04.401
Give Mr. Black a map
of the city, would you?

01:01:04.402 --> 01:01:07.095
It's okay, Bill. I can manage.

01:01:13.225 --> 01:01:15.143
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:15.227 --> 01:01:18.230
- I need a medical record number for labs.
- Uh-huh.

01:01:18.313 --> 01:01:22.859
And, uh, will you try calling her
husband? The number's on top.

01:01:28.572 --> 01:01:31.116
Also, can you page me
when C.T.'s ready?

01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:33.827
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks, sweetie.

01:01:36.496 --> 01:01:39.582
How nice you look.
Is that your uniform?

01:01:39.666 --> 01:01:42.168
What are you doing here?

01:01:44.837 --> 01:01:48.049
- Are you ill?
- Oh, goodness, no.

01:01:48.132 --> 01:01:51.844
- Then why are you here, Joe?
- I'm here to see you.

01:01:54.221 --> 01:01:57.849
Joe, I don't... I don't have
time to see you right now.

01:01:57.933 --> 01:02:00.393
I'm, um, about to start
making rounds,

01:02:00.477 --> 01:02:03.396
and I'm examining back-to-back
patients until dinner, and, uh...

01:02:03.438 --> 01:02:05.731
Very well. I'll watch.

01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:06.826
Watch me do what?

01:02:06.827 --> 01:02:09.027
Make rounds and examine
back-to-back patients.

01:02:09.068 --> 01:02:12.363
Joe, that's impossible.

01:02:12.404 --> 01:02:15.907
- I'm a doctor.
- And I'll be a visitor.

01:02:15.991 --> 01:02:19.869
- Patients have visitors, not doctors.
- I don't mind.

01:02:21.011 --> 01:02:24.681
<i>Miss? Miss?
Doctor.</i>

01:02:24.765 --> 01:02:27.543
Oh, um, just one second.
I'll be right there.

01:02:27.585 --> 01:02:29.879
Please.
My mama is sicker than him.

01:02:31.714 --> 01:02:33.632
Okay.

01:02:37.427 --> 01:02:41.056
<i>- Obeah.
- No, Mama.</i>

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:43.599
<i>Obeah, man.</i>

01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:46.602
- I goin' die.
- Mama, stop it. It's just a man.

01:02:46.686 --> 01:02:49.605
<i>- What's Obeah?
- Bad spirit. She just all fever.</i>

01:02:49.688 --> 01:02:52.608
- She don't mean nothing. Please help us.
- Of course.

01:02:52.691 --> 01:02:54.943
<i>No Obeah, sister.</i>

01:02:55.027 --> 01:02:57.487
Everything gonna be all right.

01:03:03.493 --> 01:03:06.078
- Have you registered?
- No.

01:03:06.162 --> 01:03:08.622
Okay.

01:03:16.288 --> 01:03:17.600
You gonna be all right mama?

01:03:17.601 --> 01:03:20.301
Go with the doctor lady.
Mama gonna be fine now.

01:03:20.383 --> 01:03:22.927
Don't leave.
Don't leave me.

01:03:23.011 --> 01:03:26.472
- She'll be right back, okay?
- Mama.

01:03:35.188 --> 01:03:38.858
- Obeah.
- Rahtid.

01:03:38.942 --> 01:03:41.486
Obeah evil.
I not evil, woman.

01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:44.030
And what you is then?

01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:49.285
I from that next place.

01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:52.496
You waitin' here to take us?

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.040
Like you is
the bus driver to there?

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:58.043
No, man, I on 'oliday.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.006
Some spot you pick.

01:04:05.967 --> 01:04:08.886
Oh. Mmm.

01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:12.473
The pain.
Pain is bad, bad.

01:04:12.556 --> 01:04:16.476
I don't have nothin' to do
with these things, you know.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.188
- Make it go away.
- Doctor lady make it all right.

01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:24.067
Uh-uh. Not this pain.

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:27.862
This pain go
through and through me.

01:04:27.903 --> 01:04:30.239
- Make it go away.
- I can't, sister.

01:04:30.322 --> 01:04:33.867
You can, mister.

01:04:33.909 --> 01:04:35.869
Take me to that next place.

01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:39.080
- It's not your time now.
- Make it time.

01:04:39.164 --> 01:04:41.541
You can't fool with
the way things got to be.

01:04:41.583 --> 01:04:45.378
Please?

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.843
Where she was born.

01:04:55.595 --> 01:04:58.765
Close your eyes.

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.767
Go on, sister.

01:05:33.088 --> 01:05:35.340
Soon.

01:05:39.344 --> 01:05:41.679
You... You can go with her.
I'll be right there.

01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:43.848
Come now, Mama.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:53.273
- She's in a great deal of pain.
- Yes.

01:05:56.318 --> 01:06:01.114
- Have you spent much time in the islands?
- Some.

01:06:04.158 --> 01:06:07.578
I realize now my being here,

01:06:07.620 --> 01:06:10.080
uh, is not quite appropriate.

01:06:10.122 --> 01:06:13.959
Oh, no, please...
Please don't apologize.

01:06:15.085 --> 01:06:18.255
- Yes?
- Yeah.

01:06:22.091 --> 01:06:24.469
I'm glad that you came.

01:06:24.552 --> 01:06:29.140
Thank you, Susan.
I'm very happy to be here.

01:06:31.517 --> 01:06:35.187
Joe, I'm with Drew.

01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:38.982
Not now.

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:46.405
I have to go.

01:06:46.489 --> 01:06:50.659
- I'm sorry to say.
- Be sorry for nothing.

01:06:52.828 --> 01:06:56.206
Right.

01:06:56.289 --> 01:07:00.460
- Thanks, Joe.
- Good-bye, Susan.

01:07:12.346 --> 01:07:16.600
- Good?
- Mmm.

01:07:16.683 --> 01:07:21.479
- Yes, what is it?
- Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.

01:07:21.521 --> 01:07:24.273
A little Coleman's mustard.

01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:28.444
It's, uh, splendid.

01:07:28.527 --> 01:07:31.155
Glad you like it.

01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:38.119
My wife turned me on
to cold lamb sandwiches.

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:44.375
- Joan... was my wife.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:56.845 --> 01:08:00.807
Yeah.
Cold lamb sandwiches.

01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:05.561
Not as chewy as roast beef,
not as boring as chicken.

01:08:05.645 --> 01:08:09.857
<i>She knew stuff like that.</i>

01:08:12.735 --> 01:08:15.362
Everything reminds me of her.

01:08:15.445 --> 01:08:20.116
There isn't a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:25.078
One day she didn't feel well.
The next day she was gone.

01:08:29.416 --> 01:08:31.794
So what are you gonna do?

01:08:31.877 --> 01:08:35.464
Yeah.

01:08:35.546 --> 01:08:39.091
I guess you've heard all this
a trillion times before, huh?

01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:44.055
- More.
- Why didn't you stop me?

01:08:44.138 --> 01:08:46.599
I don't know.

01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:52.729
What was it like
when you first met?

01:08:53.981 --> 01:08:56.608
I thought you'd heard it
a trillion times before.

01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:59.944
This part I'm interested in.

01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:09.620
Well, she had on
this little blue suit...

01:09:13.624 --> 01:09:18.044
With a little white collar
that had a little...

01:09:18.127 --> 01:09:21.256
red piping on it.

01:09:24.675 --> 01:09:26.886
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:31.515
Hi.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.644
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

01:09:36.978 --> 01:09:39.648
- No.
- Just kidding?

01:09:39.773 --> 01:09:43.151
<i>Sit down, Drew.</i>

01:09:43.234 --> 01:09:47.738
Uh, before I do, I was
hoping we might be alone, Bill.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:50.991
Well, Joe and I have
no secrets from each other.

01:09:51.075 --> 01:09:52.993
<i>How nice for you both.</i>

01:09:56.621 --> 01:10:01.167
Pardon my candor, but I was confounded
by your decision this morning.

01:10:01.251 --> 01:10:03.253
- Why?
- I was hired.

01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:07.256
You told me to help bring Parrish
Communications into the 21st century.

01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.652
This merger is the vehicle.

01:10:08.653 --> 01:10:10.175
<i>- In my estimation...
- Perhaps a merger is a way...</i>

01:10:10.176 --> 01:10:13.470
to bring Bill's company into the
21st century, and perhaps it isn't.

01:10:13.554 --> 01:10:16.640
And perhaps cheating on your French
philosophers exam at the Groton School...

01:10:16.723 --> 01:10:20.352
was an expedient way to get
your diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.

01:10:20.435 --> 01:10:25.898
<i>Be that as it may, Drew, a question
can often be argued both ways.</i>

01:10:25.982 --> 01:10:28.609
Joe, cut it out.
You too, Drew.

01:10:31.487 --> 01:10:33.274
I thought this was practically a done deal.

01:10:33.275 --> 01:10:35.575
Well, now it's undone, okay?

01:10:35.657 --> 01:10:38.785
Forget Bontecou.
Scrub him.

01:10:38.827 --> 01:10:42.330
I'm tired of his fancy name
and his fancy offer.

01:10:42.413 --> 01:10:45.666
I'm not going for it.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:48.461
Okay.

01:10:57.302 --> 01:11:00.305
<i>Bill,
why at this juncture...</i>

01:11:00.388 --> 01:11:04.767
are you letting yourself be so
concerned by business matters?

01:11:04.851 --> 01:11:08.687
'Cause I don't want anybody
buying up my life's work!

01:11:08.771 --> 01:11:11.607
Turning it into something
it wasn't meant to be.

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:16.153
A man wants to leave something behind.
He wants it left behind the way he made it.

01:11:16.194 --> 01:11:18.238
He wants it to be run
the way he ran it,

01:11:18.321 --> 01:11:20.824
with a sense of honor,
of dedication, of truth.

01:11:20.907 --> 01:11:23.534
Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself
a heart attack...

01:11:23.618 --> 01:11:26.704
and ruin my vacation.

01:11:44.303 --> 01:11:46.347
Now listen.

01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:48.891
I read you all the way
on the Bontecou thing,

01:11:48.974 --> 01:11:52.895
and I know where you're coming from,
and I am with you 101 percent.

01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:55.856
Well, thank you, Quince.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.568
But I just gotta tell you,

01:12:00.610 --> 01:12:03.112
if mergers are in the wind,

01:12:03.196 --> 01:12:06.866
I've developed
some great prospects.

01:12:06.949 --> 01:12:09.743
And I want to come and talk to
you about... about 'em next week.

01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:12.079
- Next week?
- Yeah.

01:12:13.288 --> 01:12:16.416
Or the week after.

01:12:18.043 --> 01:12:21.254
- No good?
- No. Why, anything's possible.

01:12:21.337 --> 01:12:24.799
- It's up to Joe.
- Joe.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.718
You just don't know
how glad I am you're aboard,

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.387
because anybody who can take
some of the weight off the old man,

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.807
I am...
I'm in his corner.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:38.228
- That's very gracious of you, Quince.
- Ah, it's no problem.

01:12:38.311 --> 01:12:42.232
Well, I'll leave you two alone,
because I can, uh...

01:12:42.315 --> 01:12:44.776
I can tell, you know...

01:12:44.817 --> 01:12:46.944
you got something in the fire.

01:12:52.574 --> 01:12:54.826
Now, look,
I know you're down.

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:59.331
But you know, when you're down,
there's no place to go but up.

01:12:59.372 --> 01:13:01.666
Up. Thanks, Quince.

01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:03.710
Forget about Bontecou.

01:13:03.793 --> 01:13:06.212
I got a couple other merger
possibilities up my sleeve,

01:13:06.295 --> 01:13:08.464
and I'm pitching 'em
to the old man.

01:13:08.547 --> 01:13:10.507
- Were you?
- Yeah.

01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:13.802
- Hey, listen.
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:13.844 --> 01:13:17.264
We're gonna go in together.
I'll clue you in.

01:13:17.347 --> 01:13:20.767
The timing has gotta be right,

01:13:20.850 --> 01:13:23.603
because the old man
says it's up to Joe.

01:13:27.106 --> 01:13:29.024
- He said it's up to Joe?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:29.108 --> 01:13:31.860
- Those were his words?
- Yeah.

01:13:31.944 --> 01:13:33.904
- It's up to Joe, huh?
- Yeah.

01:13:33.987 --> 01:13:37.616
- That's what he said?
- That's what he... That's what he said.

01:13:37.699 --> 01:13:40.660
That's very interesting.

01:13:40.744 --> 01:13:43.830
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought so too.

01:13:51.587 --> 01:13:55.257
I want to thank you all
for coming.

01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:58.510
Uh, my family, um,
Allison and Quince,

01:13:58.593 --> 01:14:00.887
Susan and
the other members.

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.267
And, uh...

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:09.895
So glad when we
can get together.

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:13.607
I mean, I know
you all have busy lives.

01:14:13.690 --> 01:14:16.276
- Look who's talking.
- Yeah. Speak for yourself.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:18.820
Yeah.

01:14:18.904 --> 01:14:23.616
I remember when you
were little girls, and, uh...

01:14:23.658 --> 01:14:26.410
I love little girls.

01:14:28.496 --> 01:14:33.333
And uh, now you're
all grown up, and I, um...

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:36.586
I had some words prepared,
but, uh,

01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.588
I've forgotten them.

01:14:38.672 --> 01:14:42.091
Um...
Wait a minute, uh...

01:14:45.845 --> 01:14:48.472
<i>- There's so much I wanted to say, uh...
- Daddy?</i>

01:14:48.514 --> 01:14:53.102
- You could sit down if you want to.
- Yeah.

01:14:53.185 --> 01:14:56.063
So many words I wanted to...

01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:58.607
So much I wanted to say,
but, uh...

01:15:01.025 --> 01:15:03.695
I can't, and so, uh...

01:15:03.778 --> 01:15:06.697
Yeah, I better sit down.

01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:11.869
Carry on, everybody, please.
Oh, one other thing.

01:15:13.454 --> 01:15:16.706
Um, why don't we all...

01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:19.751
have dinner again
tomorrow night, okay?

01:15:19.834 --> 01:15:21.794
- Dinner again?
- Yeah.

01:15:21.878 --> 01:15:24.714
You haven't had
enough of us yet, Dad?

01:15:26.424 --> 01:15:29.009
Mmm...

01:15:29.093 --> 01:15:32.179
<i>mmm...</i>

01:15:32.262 --> 01:15:34.181
no.

01:15:37.434 --> 01:15:40.186
<i>Come here.</i>

01:15:41.896 --> 01:15:44.482
- We'll be here.
- You bet we'll be here.

01:15:44.565 --> 01:15:46.651
Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

01:15:49.945 --> 01:15:51.905
Joe.

01:16:00.288 --> 01:16:02.582
Oh, no.

01:16:02.665 --> 01:16:06.127
I would prefer
some peanut butter.

01:16:06.168 --> 01:16:10.023
How would you like that, sir?
On some kind of toast?

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:11.324
Toast.

01:16:12.007 --> 01:16:15.927
- No, just the butter.
- Right away, sir.

01:16:17.304 --> 01:16:20.098
Why do you like
peanut butter so much?

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.141
I don't know.

01:16:22.183 --> 01:16:24.977
Hmm. I adore things like that.

01:16:25.019 --> 01:16:28.189
Food I can't do without.
Don't you?

01:16:28.272 --> 01:16:30.191
Yes.

01:16:30.274 --> 01:16:33.110
- It comforts you, doesn't it?
- Yes, I find that it does.

01:16:34.152 --> 01:16:36.696
<i>- Mind if I throw up?
- Drew.</i>

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:38.990
Please.

01:16:43.703 --> 01:16:47.248
I'm very concerned about the woman
you attended to today.

01:16:47.331 --> 01:16:50.751
<i>- I am too.
- Has her pain abated?</i>

01:16:50.834 --> 01:16:54.254
<i>We're doing what we can
for her, but, uh,</i>

01:16:54.338 --> 01:16:56.757
it's not looking very good.

01:16:56.840 --> 01:16:59.342
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

01:16:59.426 --> 01:17:01.553
Who are we talking about?

01:17:01.636 --> 01:17:04.847
But I know she's grateful
for the care you're giving her.

01:17:04.931 --> 01:17:07.308
Is this a state secret?

01:17:07.391 --> 01:17:09.911
No, we're talking about
a patient of mine, 'cause...

01:17:09.912 --> 01:17:10.812
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:17:10.894 --> 01:17:13.272
Joe stopped by
the hospital today.

01:17:13.355 --> 01:17:17.234
<i>He did?
That's more than we get to do.</i>

01:17:17.317 --> 01:17:20.278
Maybe next time you go to the
hospital, you'll take us along with you.

01:17:20.362 --> 01:17:22.739
- Perhaps you could remind me.
- Well, I'll make a note of it.

01:17:22.822 --> 01:17:25.616
<i>- Anything else I can do for you?
- I wanna come along too.</i>

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.952
<i>- See Susie strut her stuff.
- You're on, Quincie.</i>

01:17:28.035 --> 01:17:32.915
Destination, hospital. Joe, you
can be the tour guide, okay?

01:17:35.959 --> 01:17:38.795
Susan's a wonderful doctor.

01:17:38.878 --> 01:17:41.422
I'm sure she is.

01:17:45.593 --> 01:17:47.553
- Bill?
- Yeah?

01:17:47.595 --> 01:17:49.555
I have to go.
It's been a hell of a day.

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:50.925
I need a few minutes
to sort everything out.

01:17:50.926 --> 01:17:52.226
See you tomorrow.

01:17:58.605 --> 01:18:00.523
Joe?

01:18:04.235 --> 01:18:06.529
Yes, Bill?

01:18:06.612 --> 01:18:08.989
Um...

01:18:15.412 --> 01:18:18.915
- Why'd you go to the hospital?
- I don't know.

01:18:18.999 --> 01:18:22.544
<i>- You just curious?
- I guess.</i>

01:18:22.627 --> 01:18:25.463
<i>About Susan?</i>

01:18:25.505 --> 01:18:28.841
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it?

01:18:31.218 --> 01:18:35.055
- You tell me, Bill.
- No, how about you telling me?

01:18:35.138 --> 01:18:37.641
I ask a simple question;
I expect a straight answer.

01:18:37.724 --> 01:18:40.727
That's what I'm used to.
Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.

01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.605
Are you going to fire me, Bill?

01:18:48.317 --> 01:18:50.277
Drew?

01:18:51.362 --> 01:18:54.072
So, uh, I'll see you
tomorrow night?

01:18:54.156 --> 01:18:58.285
You include me out. I've had
enough of the convocations.

01:18:58.368 --> 01:19:02.747
You don't mean that.
You don't want to disappoint Dad.

01:19:02.789 --> 01:19:07.251
Daddy will do fine. Besides, he's
got Joe. And it seems you do too.

01:19:07.335 --> 01:19:08.754
You're out of line.

01:19:08.755 --> 01:19:10.755
Well, that may be,
but I don't like the ubiquitous creep.

01:19:10.838 --> 01:19:14.341
I don't like the way he looks at you.
I don't like the way he talks to you.

01:19:15.425 --> 01:19:17.761
And vice versa.

01:19:21.514 --> 01:19:23.933
I'm sorry.

01:19:26.269 --> 01:19:30.147
'Cause I like the way
he looks and talks to me.

01:19:30.231 --> 01:19:32.649
And vice versa.

01:19:35.152 --> 01:19:37.237
Okay?

01:19:38.655 --> 01:19:40.615
Not okay.

01:19:42.116 --> 01:19:44.702
Thought we had
a good thing going here.

01:19:44.786 --> 01:19:47.663
I thought
it was a good thing.

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:51.750
Well, that just goes to show
you never know.

01:19:54.962 --> 01:19:57.089
Night.

01:19:57.130 --> 01:20:00.133
<i>Good night.</i>

01:20:20.193 --> 01:20:23.112
How long have you
been standing there?

01:20:25.364 --> 01:20:28.492
I don't like the way
he spoke to you.

01:20:28.534 --> 01:20:31.662
But I feel better now because
of the way you spoke back.

01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:39.002
Tell me about yourself, Joe.

01:20:39.044 --> 01:20:41.004
I mean, who are you?

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:45.174
What are you doing here
with my father?

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.722
You're not going to tell me?

01:21:02.398 --> 01:21:04.984
You're married, aren't you?

01:21:05.067 --> 01:21:08.237
Why?

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:13.117
Because men who never say anything
about themselves, they're...

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.827
they're always married.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:26.212
- So you're married?
- No, I'm not.

01:21:28.089 --> 01:21:31.467
But you...
you have a girlfriend.

01:21:31.550 --> 01:21:34.761
No.

01:21:36.471 --> 01:21:40.183
- Gay?
- No.

01:21:47.732 --> 01:21:50.568
So, tell me, Joe...

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:57.115
How come a man
as attractive, intelligent,

01:21:57.157 --> 01:22:01.119
well-spoken...

01:22:04.205 --> 01:22:09.126
diffident in the most
seductive way, and yet...

01:22:12.046 --> 01:22:14.798
powerful...

01:22:18.051 --> 01:22:20.929
is all alone in this world?

01:22:34.566 --> 01:22:37.068
I'm sorry.

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:41.072
I'm s... I didn't...

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:45.368
mean to pry, and, uh,

01:22:45.451 --> 01:22:48.829
you obviously don't
want to tell me,

01:22:48.913 --> 01:22:51.623
so we'll just...

01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:56.503
We'll just leave it a mystery.

01:23:01.382 --> 01:23:05.303
- That is the way you want it, isn't it?
- Yes, thank you.

01:23:18.106 --> 01:23:20.984
Where are you going?

01:23:21.067 --> 01:23:23.278
To bed.

01:23:23.361 --> 01:23:26.447
- To bed?
- Yes.

01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:29.033
I'm tired.

01:23:34.746 --> 01:23:37.207
<i>- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Sleep well.</i>

01:23:37.290 --> 01:23:40.627
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Good night. See you.

01:23:40.710 --> 01:23:42.629
- Good night, Susie. Get some sleep.
- Good night.

01:23:42.712 --> 01:23:44.630
- Yeah.
- See you tomorrow.

01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:46.799
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:23:50.511 --> 01:23:53.472
- That was wonderful.
- Mmm.

01:23:53.514 --> 01:23:56.516
- It's good to get together.
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:05.441
Do you mind if I raise
a little caution flag?

01:24:05.525 --> 01:24:08.694
Raise away.

01:24:08.778 --> 01:24:12.573
What is the nature
of your interest in Joe?

01:24:14.116 --> 01:24:16.993
Well...

01:24:17.035 --> 01:24:20.497
Remember how you told me
about lightning striking?

01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:22.707
Mm-hmm.

01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.836
The nature of it's
in there somewhere.

01:24:26.919 --> 01:24:30.839
Yeah. Well, I won't say you're
on the wrong track, but, uh...

01:24:30.881 --> 01:24:33.342
Then what will you say?

01:24:37.596 --> 01:24:41.599
I don't think this is the
lightning you're looking for.

01:24:41.683 --> 01:24:46.562
I mean, Drew is a good man. I know I didn't
seem to be completely in his corner before,

01:24:46.604 --> 01:24:49.190
but, uh, I've come
to appreciate that, um...

01:24:49.273 --> 01:24:52.943
Now we love Drew?
And Joe doesn't measure up?

01:24:53.026 --> 01:24:57.739
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:24:57.781 --> 01:25:00.784
When you say "nothing"
that way, it is not nothing.

01:25:00.867 --> 01:25:03.202
- Then what is it?
- It's something.

01:25:07.998 --> 01:25:11.377
- Okay.
- Good night.

01:25:11.418 --> 01:25:15.297
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah. Good night.

01:25:21.636 --> 01:25:25.056
I know you're all as uncomfortable
as I am to be meeting like this.

01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:28.934
But I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.

01:25:28.976 --> 01:25:33.689
Not only is he still interested,
he's sweetening his offer.

01:25:35.774 --> 01:25:38.318
Although it pains me
to say it, in my opinion,

01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:42.238
Bill Parrish dealt with us
pre-emptively...

01:25:42.322 --> 01:25:44.907
in dismissing any deal
with Bontecou.

01:25:44.991 --> 01:25:49.578
Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we're
to examine this new offer responsibly,

01:25:49.662 --> 01:25:52.748
as the Board of Directors
of Parrish Communications,

01:25:52.831 --> 01:25:57.294
we must do so
without its chairman.

01:25:57.377 --> 01:25:59.838
There's one additional element.

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:02.340
Bontecou is so anxious
to get us,

01:26:02.382 --> 01:26:07.762
he said he'd take Parrish Communications
with Bill Parrish or without.

01:26:15.811 --> 01:26:17.854
<i>In this crisis, and be assured...</i>

01:26:17.938 --> 01:26:21.608
this is a crisis,

01:26:21.691 --> 01:26:23.776
it's not pleasant
to say the following.

01:26:23.860 --> 01:26:27.196
But I would be remiss if I did not.

01:26:27.238 --> 01:26:30.324
When we present Bill with the
improved Bontecou offer,

01:26:30.407 --> 01:26:32.826
and if he still refuses
to let us consider it,

01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:38.290
once more makes an adamant or emotional
rejection, we will have no choice but to...

01:26:38.373 --> 01:26:41.251
You're taking this too far, Drew.

01:26:42.794 --> 01:26:44.962
Am I not obligated to?

01:26:50.884 --> 01:26:53.637
See if Quince is here.

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:57.015
How did all this come about?

01:26:57.099 --> 01:27:00.894
Crisis, Bill Parrish. Crisis,
his company. Crisis for us.

01:27:00.977 --> 01:27:04.647
It came about with the arrival
on the scene of Mr. Joe Black.

01:27:04.730 --> 01:27:08.859
Mr. Joe who?
Joe Black.

01:27:08.943 --> 01:27:11.820
He attends our board meetings.

01:27:11.904 --> 01:27:15.115
He sleeps at Bill's house.
He resides in his office.

01:27:15.157 --> 01:27:17.242
He never leaves his side,
and, in my opinion,

01:27:17.325 --> 01:27:19.744
is always in his ear,
telling Bill what to do.

01:27:19.828 --> 01:27:21.996
And Bill is listening.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:24.874
Who is Joe Black?

01:27:24.957 --> 01:27:27.418
What... What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish,

01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:31.338
and most important, what is behind
his influence on our chairman?

01:27:31.422 --> 01:27:36.885
<i>He's had advisors before.
Nobody tells Bill what to do.</i>

01:27:40.430 --> 01:27:45.351
- Thanks for coming, Quince.
- Sure. Hi, Ed.

01:27:45.393 --> 01:27:49.146
<i>Hi, folks.</i>

01:27:49.230 --> 01:27:52.316
I didn't know everybody
was going to be here.

01:27:52.357 --> 01:27:55.610
Nice surprise.

01:27:55.694 --> 01:27:57.612
What's with the new digs?

01:27:57.696 --> 01:28:02.200
<i>Drew's idea of cloak and dagger.
This is a secret meeting, Quince.</i>

01:28:02.283 --> 01:28:05.411
I hope you'll
respect its nature.

01:28:14.628 --> 01:28:16.546
Have a seat, Quince.

01:28:31.435 --> 01:28:34.771
Now, what we're trying
to do here is to, uh...

01:28:34.855 --> 01:28:39.776
to gather our thoughts in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer...

01:28:39.859 --> 01:28:42.237
and to make an appropriate
presentation to him...

01:28:42.278 --> 01:28:45.698
as to how we think
the company might proceed.

01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:49.577
Won't you share with our board the
information you gave me last night?

01:28:52.538 --> 01:28:57.626
Well, uh, I'm hap... I'm happy
to tell you I got good news.

01:28:57.709 --> 01:29:00.795
As I was, uh,
as I was telling Drew,

01:29:00.879 --> 01:29:05.591
uh, I've been making a little hay while
the Bontecou sun was shining.

01:29:05.675 --> 01:29:09.637
Two, possibly three, new and
boiling hot prospects for merger.

01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.890
Mm-hmm. And how did Bill react
to the leads you've developed?

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:13.920
He was interested.

01:29:13.921 --> 01:29:17.521
Yeah, but he was
concerned about the timing?

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:22.774
- Timing?
- Yeah, he was concerned about the timing?

01:29:22.815 --> 01:29:26.611
Yes. He says it's up to Joe.

01:29:29.738 --> 01:29:32.157
It's up to Joe.

01:29:47.713 --> 01:29:50.341
- ~ Dum-da-dum ~
- What's this?

01:29:50.424 --> 01:29:55.095
- Um, Annie made them.
- Who's Annie?

01:29:55.178 --> 01:29:58.014
Thank you, Lillian.
From La Rosette?

01:29:58.056 --> 01:30:01.392
She's only the most famous
pastry chef in America.

01:30:01.476 --> 01:30:05.146
<i>Um, this is orange,
made with real Seville oranges.</i>

01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:08.816
<i>And, uh, that's lemon
on a mille-feuille crust.</i>

01:30:08.858 --> 01:30:12.194
I don't like cake.

01:30:12.236 --> 01:30:14.988
It's for the party, Dad.

01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:18.491
Ah. The goddamn party.

01:30:18.575 --> 01:30:21.661
The goddamn party.
Mm-hmm.

01:30:21.744 --> 01:30:24.288
<i>- Did you hear that?
- I'm sorry.</i>

01:30:25.581 --> 01:30:28.667
<i>The goddamn party. Oh.</i>

01:30:28.751 --> 01:30:31.462
<i>- Come on, I...
- Here, let's try this one...</i>

01:30:31.545 --> 01:30:34.381
<i>right over here.</i>

01:30:37.008 --> 01:30:39.886
Mmm.

01:30:39.928 --> 01:30:44.474
This, this is terrific.
It has, um,

01:30:44.557 --> 01:30:46.934
has vodka in it, Bill.

01:30:46.976 --> 01:30:49.019
A little vodka, right?

01:30:49.103 --> 01:30:51.063
Has, um, that fruity vodka,
that flavored stuff, right?

01:30:51.146 --> 01:30:54.942
Bill, put your lips around this.
It's just out of this world.

01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:59.070
<i>I'm sorry, honey.
You know, I'm no good at this.</i>

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:01.072
Why don't you choose
whichever cake you'd like?

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:04.200
<i>- Hmm?
- I knew you were gonna say that.</i>

01:31:04.283 --> 01:31:06.786
<i>- What?
- I mean you just don't care.</i>

01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:10.539
Oh, why am I doing this?
I should have my head examined again.

01:31:10.623 --> 01:31:15.752
<i>Oh, my God. I am trying to
throw the party of the century...</i>

01:31:15.836 --> 01:31:18.546
For my father in two days.

01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:20.590
- And you just don't give a shit.
- He gives a shit.

01:31:20.673 --> 01:31:23.551
<i>- He doesn't give a shit!
- He does.</i>

01:31:23.634 --> 01:31:26.304
<i>- Allison.
- He does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?</i>

01:31:27.930 --> 01:31:30.975
Come on. Come on.

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.313
<i>- Come on. Smile.
- I'm sorry.</i>

01:31:41.025 --> 01:31:43.653
But what should we tell Annie?

01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:47.448
~ Bum-bum-bum ~

01:31:49.533 --> 01:31:53.495
This one. Mmm.

01:31:53.579 --> 01:31:55.100
<i>He gives a shit!</i>

01:31:59.751 --> 01:32:02.337
Fantastic.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.798
Thank you.

01:32:13.055 --> 01:32:15.891
<i>Um, Mr. Black, would you
care for a piece?</i>

01:32:15.974 --> 01:32:18.435
Yes, I'd love one.

01:32:24.774 --> 01:32:26.817
Have you had a chance
to, uh,

01:32:26.901 --> 01:32:30.738
look at my father's rare books?

01:32:30.821 --> 01:32:35.867
He has Jefferson's
parliamentary manual, and, uh,

01:32:35.951 --> 01:32:38.411
<i>this first edition of Bleak House.</i>

01:32:38.453 --> 01:32:41.247
I love your smell.

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:49.839
Well, I like
the way you smell too.

01:32:58.013 --> 01:33:02.183
My mom always used to say that
you could set your heart by that clock.

01:33:08.439 --> 01:33:11.525
Could you?

01:33:11.608 --> 01:33:14.027
I never tried.

01:33:16.822 --> 01:33:19.866
Till now.

01:33:24.537 --> 01:33:27.123
- Joe?
- Hmm?

01:33:30.501 --> 01:33:33.295
May I kiss you?

01:33:33.337 --> 01:33:36.339
Why, yes, you can.

01:34:01.237 --> 01:34:03.656
Mmm.

01:34:43.276 --> 01:34:45.653
Thank you.

01:34:47.530 --> 01:34:50.324
You're welcome.

01:34:54.786 --> 01:34:59.290
- Joe?
- Mmm.

01:34:59.374 --> 01:35:02.877
I don't know who you are.

01:35:06.631 --> 01:35:09.633
- I'm Joe.
- Mm-hmm.

01:35:09.717 --> 01:35:13.554
And, uh, you're Susan.

01:35:13.637 --> 01:35:16.390
Mmm.

01:35:16.473 --> 01:35:19.851
And... I have this...

01:35:19.893 --> 01:35:22.353
weak feeling in my knees.

01:35:22.437 --> 01:35:25.857
- And is your heart beating strangely?
- Yes.

01:35:25.898 --> 01:35:27.900
- Mm-hmm.
- Faster.

01:35:29.276 --> 01:35:32.196
The taste of your lips
and the touch of your tongue...

01:35:32.237 --> 01:35:34.364
that was wonderful.

01:35:35.449 --> 01:35:37.409
Mmm.

01:35:42.247 --> 01:35:44.165
I should, um...

01:35:45.249 --> 01:35:47.168
I should go home.

01:35:47.251 --> 01:35:50.212
Mmm.

01:35:50.254 --> 01:35:52.756
Shouldn't I?

01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:57.552
Yeah.

01:36:22.492 --> 01:36:26.287
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:34.002
Hello, Bill.

01:36:36.463 --> 01:36:39.758
Hello.

01:36:43.052 --> 01:36:46.722
Would you like to join me and
Allison and Quince for a nightcap?

01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:52.227
No. Not right now.

01:36:56.314 --> 01:36:58.650
Okay.

01:37:01.319 --> 01:37:03.279
Then I'll say good night.

01:37:03.321 --> 01:37:05.281
Good night, Bill.

01:37:15.332 --> 01:37:17.751
<i>Morning, Quince.
Top of the morning, B.P.</i>

01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:20.378
- Hello, Quince.
- Hey!

01:37:23.089 --> 01:37:26.092
- Hello, Jennifer.
- Good morning, Mr. Parrish.

01:37:26.175 --> 01:37:28.427
- The board is waiting.
- What?

01:37:28.511 --> 01:37:31.305
- The board?
- Didn't you call a board meeting?

01:37:31.388 --> 01:37:33.015
No.

01:37:44.859 --> 01:37:47.653
- Good morning.
- Morning, Bill.

01:37:47.737 --> 01:37:50.990
Did you want to have a
cup of coffee or something, Bill?

01:37:53.575 --> 01:37:57.579
I don't think so.
Do you?

01:37:57.662 --> 01:38:02.750
To get to the point, we've received
new information from John Bontecou...

01:38:02.834 --> 01:38:05.586
concerning his desires for this
company to merge with his.

01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:08.339
<i>And we wanted
to set the details before you.</i>

01:38:08.422 --> 01:38:11.342
<i>Is that it? Bontecou wants
a quick response, and...</i>

01:38:11.425 --> 01:38:14.303
The answer is no.
Quick enough for you?

01:38:14.386 --> 01:38:16.763
<i>- Don't you want to hear the details?
- I'm not interested.</i>

01:38:16.847 --> 01:38:20.100
<i>I'm not interested in the big picture
either. What I am interested in...</i>

01:38:20.183 --> 01:38:22.727
is how my board got convened
behind my back...

01:38:22.810 --> 01:38:24.865
<i>and is entertaining a further proposal</i>

01:38:24.866 --> 01:38:27.766
<i>from a man with whom it
offends me to do business.</i>

01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:31.735
I made a decision.
Case closed.

01:38:31.777 --> 01:38:34.696
So am I to understand
from your response...

01:38:34.780 --> 01:38:37.574
that you do not want to hear
the details of Bontecou's offer?

01:38:37.616 --> 01:38:39.576
Yes, you are
to understand that.

01:38:39.617 --> 01:38:41.911
And now, may I ask
you a question?

01:38:41.953 --> 01:38:45.665
<i>- Certainly, Bill.
- Are you running this board, or am I?</i>

01:38:50.336 --> 01:38:52.254
That's it?

01:38:54.214 --> 01:38:57.259
We've got a busy day ahead.
This meeting's already set me behind.

01:38:57.342 --> 01:38:58.687
Shall we adjourn?

01:38:58.688 --> 01:39:00.888
Uh, before we do, Bill,
while we're here...

01:39:01.471 --> 01:39:03.973
There's a second question the
board would like a response to.

01:39:04.057 --> 01:39:07.893
Far simpler one.

01:39:07.935 --> 01:39:10.813
Who is the man
standing to your left?

01:39:13.899 --> 01:39:16.693
I've already introduced
Mr. Black to you all.

01:39:16.735 --> 01:39:19.654
<i>But who is he?
What are his credentials?</i>

01:39:19.738 --> 01:39:22.323
What is his relationship to you?

01:39:28.913 --> 01:39:31.874
The board is deeply concerned.

01:39:31.915 --> 01:39:35.377
We have reason to believe Mr. Black is
not only influencing your decisions...

01:39:35.460 --> 01:39:37.546
in regard to this company,

01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:41.216
but that you are relying
on him to make them for you.

01:39:45.469 --> 01:39:48.305
The lack of response, Bill,
is not appropriate.

01:39:48.389 --> 01:39:50.891
We are your board.

01:39:50.933 --> 01:39:54.311
We have a right to know how you are
managing the operations of this company.

01:39:54.394 --> 01:39:59.065
<i>And, most importantly, that you have
not delegated someone to do it for you.</i>

01:39:59.107 --> 01:40:01.109
<i>Okay?</i>

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.530
One more time.
Who is Joe Black?

01:40:16.748 --> 01:40:19.626
A motion has been brought
before the board...

01:40:19.668 --> 01:40:22.629
to invoke Article 19
of the corporate charter.

01:40:22.670 --> 01:40:24.964
In English, please.

01:40:29.301 --> 01:40:34.014
Mandatory retirement
on our chairman's 65th birthday,

01:40:34.097 --> 01:40:36.892
<i>at which time the chairman
will be named emeritus.</i>

01:40:36.975 --> 01:40:39.936
<i>You're welcome to attend
all meetings...</i>

01:40:40.019 --> 01:40:43.022
<i>and will serve as international
spokesman for the corporation.</i>

01:40:43.106 --> 01:40:45.441
Plus, of course,
a settlement,

01:40:45.525 --> 01:40:49.278
a golden parachute of such magnitude
that his feet will never touch the ground.

01:40:51.363 --> 01:40:54.825
Please indicate your vote
by a yes or no.

01:40:54.908 --> 01:40:58.119
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:40:58.203 --> 01:41:01.289
Yes.

01:41:04.625 --> 01:41:08.671
- No.
- No.

01:41:10.297 --> 01:41:12.758
Motion's passed.

01:41:16.636 --> 01:41:20.056
We will, of course, delay the announcement
out of respect for our former chairman...

01:41:20.140 --> 01:41:24.852
<i>until after the celebration
of his birthday this weekend.</i>

01:41:24.894 --> 01:41:28.522
Well, thanks for allowing me
to save face, Drew.

01:41:28.606 --> 01:41:31.525
<i>The other motion before us is the
acceptance of John Bontecou's offer...</i>

01:41:31.567 --> 01:41:35.696
to merge this corporation
with Bontecou International.

01:41:51.794 --> 01:41:55.005
Okay. Joe?

01:42:05.765 --> 01:42:07.933
Who I am...

01:42:07.975 --> 01:42:11.937
and what my relationship is
to William Parrish...

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:15.273
will be divulged
in our own good time.

01:42:16.483 --> 01:42:20.904
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Black.

01:42:25.575 --> 01:42:27.618
It's not over till it's over.

01:42:27.702 --> 01:42:29.995
Please, Eddie,
no "fat lady sings" stuff.

01:42:30.079 --> 01:42:34.458
I still sense some doubt in this group.
We could turn it around.

01:42:34.499 --> 01:42:36.543
- You'll be up in the country?
- Yeah.

01:42:36.626 --> 01:42:39.713
The big celebration of my mandatory
retirement birthday.

01:42:39.796 --> 01:42:41.714
<i>You're an honored guest, Eddie.</i>

01:42:41.798 --> 01:42:44.967
I'm gonna stick it out here.
We still have a shot.

01:42:45.051 --> 01:42:48.637
Get John's office on the phone.
Tell them I'll be there in 20 minutes.

01:42:50.598 --> 01:42:52.933
What did you do?

01:42:53.016 --> 01:42:56.269
- You've gotten the old man fired.
- That we did.

01:42:56.353 --> 01:42:58.772
Thanks to you.

01:42:58.855 --> 01:43:02.066
<i>He was wobbling, mind you,
but you supplied the coup de grÃ¢ce.</i>

01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:04.610
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

01:43:04.694 --> 01:43:07.863
Quince, you can't unscramble
scrambled eggs.

01:43:07.947 --> 01:43:10.908
I- I didn't mean to do this.

01:43:10.991 --> 01:43:13.702
Train's left the station, pal,
and you're aboard.

01:43:15.037 --> 01:43:17.998
Now, would you like to hear
the silver lining?

01:43:18.081 --> 01:43:20.750
Check that. Gold.

01:43:23.461 --> 01:43:26.631
Once John Bontecou acquires
Parrish Communications,

01:43:26.714 --> 01:43:31.593
he's gonna break it apart, peddle it
piece by piece to the highest bidder.

01:43:32.761 --> 01:43:35.305
That was the game plan
right from the start.

01:43:35.389 --> 01:43:37.766
I set it up for him, and he
smacks it out of the park.

01:43:37.849 --> 01:43:41.186
Ramifications for you?

01:43:41.269 --> 01:43:44.272
You'll be farting through silk.

01:43:44.355 --> 01:43:49.443
You'll sell your stock.
You'll be positively, truly rich.

01:43:49.527 --> 01:43:52.780
You can stop kissing ass.

01:43:52.821 --> 01:43:55.615
What'll it feel like to be a man?

01:43:57.659 --> 01:44:02.372
I'm going to expose you.

01:44:02.455 --> 01:44:04.916
Okay. Go right ahead.

01:44:04.999 --> 01:44:08.711
You tell William Parrish how you
betrayed him in a secret board meeting.

01:44:08.794 --> 01:44:13.006
Tell Allison how you helped
her father lose his company.

01:44:16.009 --> 01:44:19.137
It's just life, Quincie.

01:44:19.179 --> 01:44:22.307
Wake up and smell the thorns.

01:44:57.088 --> 01:44:59.549
You're here.

01:44:59.632 --> 01:45:02.385
I am.

01:45:03.553 --> 01:45:06.389
I, uh... just dropped by.

01:45:06.472 --> 01:45:11.935
I thought I'd scrounge some lunch.
I was in the neighborhood.

01:45:12.019 --> 01:45:14.062
I'm so glad.

01:45:14.146 --> 01:45:19.192
<i>When I called, they said that you
and Dad had already left the office.</i>

01:45:19.234 --> 01:45:22.445
<i>Mm-hmm.
He's taking a nap.</i>

01:45:22.528 --> 01:45:26.407
Oh. Yeah.

01:45:28.659 --> 01:45:33.413
Well, uh, he must be tired.

01:45:33.497 --> 01:45:36.541
You know,
this whole Bontecou thing...

01:45:36.625 --> 01:45:38.918
It, um, seems...

01:45:38.960 --> 01:45:43.589
<i>Yes, he's tired.
I believe so.</i>

01:45:43.673 --> 01:45:45.591
Yeah.

01:45:52.681 --> 01:45:55.392
You must be hungry then.

01:45:57.602 --> 01:45:59.521
No.

01:45:59.604 --> 01:46:02.023
Not anymore.

01:46:03.858 --> 01:46:06.152
Are you?

01:51:25.486 --> 01:51:28.447
<i>I loved making love to you.</i>

01:51:29.949 --> 01:51:35.078
It was like
making love with someone...

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.415
making love
for the first time.

01:51:41.459 --> 01:51:43.419
Thank you.

01:51:47.631 --> 01:51:51.176
Do you like
making love with me?

01:51:54.304 --> 01:51:56.681
Yes.

01:51:57.724 --> 01:52:00.685
More than
you love peanut butter?

01:52:00.768 --> 01:52:02.812
Yes.

01:52:02.895 --> 01:52:05.398
Much more.

01:52:17.284 --> 01:52:21.538
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere. I'm here.

01:52:22.705 --> 01:52:25.041
For how long?

01:52:25.082 --> 01:52:28.085
I hope a long, long time.

01:52:30.045 --> 01:52:32.381
Me too.

01:52:39.512 --> 01:52:42.307
What do we do now?

01:52:45.810 --> 01:52:47.895
Um...

01:52:50.356 --> 01:52:53.901
it'll come to us.

01:53:24.137 --> 01:53:29.099
Hello, Bill.
Did you have a nice nap?

01:53:30.768 --> 01:53:35.355
- I couldn't sleep.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:39.150
I'll come down.

01:53:42.111 --> 01:53:45.740
<i>What's going on?
Hmm?</i>

01:53:46.824 --> 01:53:48.993
I saw you kiss Susan.

01:53:49.076 --> 01:53:51.620
Yes, I saw you see me.

01:53:51.662 --> 01:53:54.039
You're at the wrong place at the
wrong time with the wrong woman.

01:53:54.122 --> 01:53:56.750
- I'll be the judge of that.
- I'm her father.

01:53:56.833 --> 01:53:59.502
With all due respect,
Bill, I'm not asking your permission.

01:53:59.586 --> 01:54:03.673
You goddamn well should!

01:54:12.681 --> 01:54:17.227
You walk into my life.
You give me the worst news a guy can get.

01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:20.021
You have me dancing on heads of
pins with my business, my family.

01:54:20.105 --> 01:54:22.649
<i>- Now you're spooning with my daughter?
- "Spooning"?</i>

01:54:22.732 --> 01:54:26.110
<i>Yes! And stop repeating everything
I say and turning it into a question.</i>

01:54:26.193 --> 01:54:30.155
<i>Spooning, fooling around
and God knows what.</i>

01:54:30.239 --> 01:54:32.783
Oh, you arrive on the scene...

01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:36.286
Why you picked me
I still don't understand.

01:54:36.369 --> 01:54:39.247
I chose you for your verve,
your excellence...

01:54:39.289 --> 01:54:43.626
and your ability to...
instruct.

01:54:43.710 --> 01:54:47.338
You've lived a first-rate life,
and I find it eminently usable.

01:54:50.883 --> 01:54:53.135
What do you want?

01:54:54.303 --> 01:54:56.263
Huh?

01:54:57.889 --> 01:55:01.059
Everybody wants something, Joe.

01:55:01.100 --> 01:55:04.103
You've been taking me
from pillar to post here.

01:55:04.145 --> 01:55:06.606
And, uh,

01:55:06.689 --> 01:55:10.943
I thought I knew who you were,
and it wasn't a lot of fun.

01:55:11.026 --> 01:55:14.071
But it was almost bearable.

01:55:14.154 --> 01:55:17.866
But now I'm getting something
else from you, something very...

01:55:17.949 --> 01:55:20.368
very strange.

01:55:20.452 --> 01:55:23.496
What is it that you want?

01:55:23.579 --> 01:55:26.415
I'm only living
the Parrish bywords...

01:55:26.457 --> 01:55:29.251
looking for that
"ounce of excitement,"

01:55:29.293 --> 01:55:33.338
that " whisper of a thrill there is
no sense living your life without. "

01:55:34.506 --> 01:55:37.551
You know what I mean, Bill?

01:55:39.135 --> 01:55:42.805
You're violating
the laws of the universe.

01:55:42.889 --> 01:55:47.435
- This universe?
- Any universe that exists or ever existed.

01:55:47.518 --> 01:55:52.523
You may be the pro, Joe,
but I know who you are,

01:55:52.606 --> 01:55:55.067
and you're all fucked up.

01:55:57.944 --> 01:56:01.447
I don't like your tone,
and I don't like your references.

01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:04.075
And I don't give a shit.

01:56:04.158 --> 01:56:09.663
Perhaps it's time to remind you this is not
simply a dispute with a putative suitor.

01:56:09.747 --> 01:56:13.667
This is me.
So be careful, Bill.

01:56:13.750 --> 01:56:17.254
Cut all that "Bill" crap out,
you son of a bitch.

01:56:17.337 --> 01:56:21.549
I'll say it again.
Be careful, Bill.

01:56:29.765 --> 01:56:33.393
Can I help you?
Excuse me, can I help you?

01:56:33.477 --> 01:56:37.772
Yes. Dr. Parrish, please.

01:56:37.856 --> 01:56:41.151
<i>She comes on at 6:00.</i>

01:56:41.234 --> 01:56:43.152
Oh.

01:56:52.494 --> 01:56:54.496
Hi.

01:56:57.082 --> 01:57:00.585
<i>- Where's Joe?
- Joe?</i>

01:57:02.503 --> 01:57:05.256
Joe's not around.

01:57:06.465 --> 01:57:10.052
<i>- Do you know where he is?
- I don't know.</i>

01:57:10.135 --> 01:57:12.096
Oh.

01:57:13.472 --> 01:57:16.308
Why are you looking for Joe?

01:57:16.349 --> 01:57:20.353
<i>Love. Passion. Obsession.</i>

01:57:20.437 --> 01:57:23.648
All those things
you told me to wait for.

01:57:23.689 --> 01:57:26.150
- They've arrived.
- This is crazy.

01:57:28.986 --> 01:57:30.821
Why?

01:57:30.904 --> 01:57:34.032
A man shows up,
almost never leaves your side.

01:57:34.116 --> 01:57:38.703
Well, you clearly trust him,
depend on him.

01:57:38.787 --> 01:57:42.540
So why aren't those things
good enough for me?

01:57:42.624 --> 01:57:45.501
<i>- You don't know anything about Joe.
- What are you afraid of?</i>

01:57:45.543 --> 01:57:49.129
That I'll fall
head over heels for Joe?

01:57:50.381 --> 01:57:53.425
Well, I have.
Just like you did with Mom.

01:57:53.508 --> 01:57:56.636
Isn't that what you've
always wanted for me?

01:57:56.720 --> 01:57:58.638
Susan...

01:58:01.015 --> 01:58:05.019
I don't think Joe is
gonna be with us long.

01:58:05.061 --> 01:58:07.855
Where is he going?

01:58:07.938 --> 01:58:10.357
I don't know.

01:58:10.399 --> 01:58:13.360
<i>- I can't say.
- Oh, come on.</i>

01:58:13.402 --> 01:58:18.156
The guy's working with you. You know chapter
and verse about everyone working with you.

01:58:18.239 --> 01:58:21.201
<i>In this case I can't. I...</i>

01:58:21.284 --> 01:58:26.831
I only will tell you that with Joe,
you're on... very, very dangerous ground.

01:58:34.755 --> 01:58:36.715
I love him.

01:58:36.756 --> 01:58:41.094
I don't care if you love him!
I'm telling you!

01:58:51.895 --> 01:58:54.648
Joe's no good for you.

01:58:56.775 --> 01:58:59.903
Of course not, Daddy.

01:58:59.944 --> 01:59:01.905
I'm sorry.

01:59:06.659 --> 01:59:09.411
I love you too.

01:59:39.564 --> 01:59:44.235
Mr. Bad News.
'Bout time you show up.

01:59:48.322 --> 01:59:51.200
Don't be feisty, sister.

01:59:51.283 --> 01:59:53.702
I'm not feisty, mister.

01:59:53.744 --> 01:59:57.289
You come for me?
That's good news.

01:59:59.165 --> 02:00:01.918
No, I come to see the doctor.

02:00:02.001 --> 02:00:04.837
- Doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

02:00:04.879 --> 02:00:08.007
- What could be wrong with you?
- Nothin'.

02:00:10.009 --> 02:00:13.971
Ohh. You come
to see doctor lady?

02:00:14.054 --> 02:00:16.515
- Yeah, man.
- My doctor lady?

02:00:18.558 --> 02:00:21.060
Mine too, you know.

02:00:23.104 --> 02:00:26.190
You're in love?

02:00:32.696 --> 02:00:35.657
You're loved back?

02:00:42.538 --> 02:00:46.334
She know your real self?

02:00:46.417 --> 02:00:49.753
- She know how she feel.
- Backside!

02:00:49.837 --> 02:00:52.506
What the hell kind
of business this is.

02:00:52.589 --> 02:00:55.008
Don't need you okayin'.

02:00:55.092 --> 02:00:59.512
<i>Schoolboy things in your head.
Badness for you.</i>

02:00:59.596 --> 02:01:01.973
Badness for her.

02:01:02.015 --> 02:01:05.309
Badness for me, lyin' here,

02:01:05.393 --> 02:01:07.520
tumor big as a breadfruit,

02:01:07.603 --> 02:01:12.232
poisonin' me inside,
and waitin'.

02:01:12.316 --> 02:01:15.944
Bring you flowers,
and all I's gettin' is aggravation.

02:01:16.027 --> 02:01:19.197
The only flowers
I want to see...

02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.993
is the ones over my peaceful
self resting in the dirt.

02:01:24.077 --> 02:01:27.329
Can't do no right by people.
Come to take you, you want to stay.

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:30.749
Leave you stay, you want to go.
Rahtid.

02:01:33.502 --> 02:01:38.131
You're not in
your right place, mister.

02:01:38.214 --> 02:01:40.592
Me neither.

02:01:40.675 --> 02:01:42.677
No more.

02:01:42.719 --> 02:01:45.555
Take me, and you come
with me now.

02:01:56.523 --> 02:01:59.651
But I not lonely here.

02:02:01.819 --> 02:02:04.614
Somebody want me here.

02:02:06.449 --> 02:02:08.576
Hmm.

02:02:08.659 --> 02:02:12.412
It nice it happen to you.

02:02:12.496 --> 02:02:16.249
Like you come to the island
and had a holiday.

02:02:18.209 --> 02:02:22.797
Sun didn't burn you red-red,
just brown.

02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.885
<i>You sleep,
and no mosquito eat you.</i>

02:02:27.968 --> 02:02:32.264
But the truth is,
it bound to happen...

02:02:32.306 --> 02:02:35.142
if you stay long enough.

02:02:36.893 --> 02:02:41.522
So take that nice picture
you got in your head home with you,

02:02:42.982 --> 02:02:46.110
but don't be fooled.

02:02:50.281 --> 02:02:53.575
We lonely here mostly too.

02:02:55.452 --> 02:02:58.371
<i>If we lucky, maybe...</i>

02:02:59.998 --> 02:03:04.085
we got some nice pictures
to take with us.

02:03:28.190 --> 02:03:31.110
You got enough nice pictures?

02:03:35.364 --> 02:03:37.282
Yes.

02:04:31.832 --> 02:04:34.459
Good-bye, sister.

02:04:58.023 --> 02:05:00.483
Yes?

02:05:00.567 --> 02:05:04.445
I have the feeling, all in all,

02:05:04.529 --> 02:05:09.200
what I made this voyage for
has served its purpose.

02:05:11.744 --> 02:05:15.914
What are you saying?
It's time to go?

02:05:22.795 --> 02:05:25.131
I'm ready.

02:05:25.214 --> 02:05:27.550
You are?

02:05:29.009 --> 02:05:31.095
Yeah.

02:05:33.639 --> 02:05:38.768
Good. Tomorrow.
After the party.

02:06:09.672 --> 02:06:11.757
- Yes, Helen?
- Telephone call, sir.

02:06:11.840 --> 02:06:14.509
- Mr. Sloane from New York.
- Thank you.

02:06:14.593 --> 02:06:16.511
Excuse me.

02:06:27.396 --> 02:06:29.440
Thank you.

02:06:33.610 --> 02:06:35.529
Hey!

02:06:36.613 --> 02:06:38.531
Hey.

02:06:40.700 --> 02:06:43.161
Red or white?

02:06:43.244 --> 02:06:45.663
- No. No, thank you.
- Have a drink.

02:06:45.746 --> 02:06:49.166
- You look like you need one as bad as me.
- I do?

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:56.298
- Quince?
- Mm-hmm.

02:06:56.339 --> 02:06:58.967
I find myself a little confused.

02:07:02.762 --> 02:07:05.181
- Confused, huh?
- Yes.

02:07:05.264 --> 02:07:07.266
- About what?
- Love.

02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:09.977
Love.

02:07:10.019 --> 02:07:13.689
Oh, man.
I got problems of my own.

02:07:16.942 --> 02:07:20.987
- You love Allison, don't you?
- Yes, I do.

02:07:21.070 --> 02:07:23.031
How did you meet?

02:07:24.532 --> 02:07:26.867
Well, um,

02:07:26.951 --> 02:07:31.038
I was this world-class loser,
and she was this happy little rich girl,

02:07:31.121 --> 02:07:34.333
and for some reason
she took me in.

02:07:36.251 --> 02:07:38.962
But Allison loves you.

02:07:49.638 --> 02:07:51.974
How do you know?

02:07:57.062 --> 02:08:00.815
Because she knows the
worst thing about me, and it's okay.

02:08:00.899 --> 02:08:02.894
What is it?

02:08:02.895 --> 02:08:05.277
No, it's not one thing.
It's just an idea, Joe.

02:08:05.278 --> 02:08:08.155
It's just, um, um...

02:08:09.657 --> 02:08:13.911
It's like you know
each other's secrets,

02:08:14.995 --> 02:08:18.999
your deepest,
darkest secrets.

02:08:19.082 --> 02:08:23.961
- Deepest, darkest secrets?
- Yeah, and then you... you're free.

02:08:24.003 --> 02:08:26.005
Free?

02:08:27.173 --> 02:08:30.134
You're free!
You're free to I...

02:08:30.217 --> 02:08:32.845
love each other
completely, totally.

02:08:32.928 --> 02:08:36.473
Just no fear.

02:08:36.598 --> 02:08:40.351
So there's nothing you don't know
about each other, and it's okay.

02:08:43.062 --> 02:08:45.022
Hmm.

02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:55.502
Do you like me, Joe?

02:08:55.803 --> 02:08:59.903
Oh, yes, Quince.
You're one of my favorites.

02:09:04.707 --> 02:09:10.045
What would you say if you knew it was
me who brought down Bill Parrish?

02:09:13.298 --> 02:09:17.302
Oh, I told Drew and the board
that Bill depended on you.

02:09:17.385 --> 02:09:20.180
Drew and Bontecou are gonna chop up
the company, sell it off for parts.

02:09:20.263 --> 02:09:22.181
Bontecou was outside.
Drew was Mr. Inside.

02:09:22.265 --> 02:09:27.311
And I was the fool
who made it all happen.

02:09:30.439 --> 02:09:32.399
Ohh...

02:09:33.442 --> 02:09:35.402
God.

02:09:42.950 --> 02:09:45.494
What do I do?

02:09:45.578 --> 02:09:48.706
Go to Bill Parrish
and tell him the truth.

02:09:48.789 --> 02:09:51.208
He'll forgive you.

02:09:53.418 --> 02:09:56.463
- You think so?
- Yes.

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:02.468
You think I should wait
till after the party?

02:10:02.552 --> 02:10:04.470
No.

02:10:07.473 --> 02:10:09.892
No.

02:10:09.975 --> 02:10:13.562
Four down here
and a sturgeon up there.

02:10:13.645 --> 02:10:16.439
<i>This one is perfect.
Absolutely.</i>

02:10:16.481 --> 02:10:20.110
<i>Okay, I think
I want four here like that...</i>

02:10:20.193 --> 02:10:22.654
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

02:10:22.737 --> 02:10:25.364
What do you think?

02:10:25.448 --> 02:10:29.076
Well, it's, uh...
it's starting to grow on me.

02:10:29.159 --> 02:10:32.412
Oh, I've got a baritone
with a balalaika...

02:10:32.496 --> 02:10:35.082
coming from
the Russian Tea Room.

02:10:35.165 --> 02:10:39.252
I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt,
and he'll be singing Nelson Eddy songs.

02:10:39.335 --> 02:10:41.254
Wow.

02:10:43.172 --> 02:10:45.508
You really are amazing.

02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:49.887
But why, oh, why, Allison,
are you doing all this?

02:10:53.473 --> 02:10:58.144
I do it because I love you.
Everybody loves you:

02:10:58.228 --> 02:11:02.440
Mommy, wherever she is,
Susan, Quince...

02:11:03.816 --> 02:11:08.279
<i>all the people you work with,
anyone who's ever met you.</i>

02:11:09.488 --> 02:11:11.740
Ohh, Daddy.

02:11:11.824 --> 02:11:15.952
After all, you've been
a wonderful father.

02:11:18.246 --> 02:11:20.623
Yeah, well,

02:11:20.707 --> 02:11:22.875
I haven't been the father
to you that, uh...

02:11:22.917 --> 02:11:25.628
- That you've been to Susan?
- I wasn't going to say that.

02:11:25.711 --> 02:11:29.506
But that's what you were thinking.
And that's okay.

02:11:29.590 --> 02:11:31.759
Because I know
that you love me.

02:11:31.842 --> 02:11:35.095
I mean, it's not
like it is with her.

02:11:35.178 --> 02:11:38.890
Whenever she walks into the room,
your eyes light up.

02:11:38.973 --> 02:11:42.226
She always gets a smile
from you, as opposed to me.

02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:45.146
When I walk in,

02:11:45.229 --> 02:11:49.233
this look comes over your face, like,
"What does she want now?"

02:11:49.316 --> 02:11:53.028
<i>But you've never let
either of us want for anything.</i>

02:11:53.111 --> 02:11:56.948
Oh, God. More than that,
Daddy, more than that.

02:12:01.869 --> 02:12:06.040
I've felt loved,
and that's all that matters.

02:12:06.123 --> 02:12:09.627
So, never mind favorites.

02:12:09.710 --> 02:12:11.628
You're allowed to have one.

02:12:11.712 --> 02:12:15.007
The point is, you've been mine.

02:12:17.759 --> 02:12:19.677
Oh, Allison.

02:12:21.429 --> 02:12:23.347
Oh.

02:12:26.851 --> 02:12:28.853
I really feel...

02:12:30.562 --> 02:12:33.523
I've everything I could've ever
wanted for my birthday.

02:12:33.607 --> 02:12:36.568
Oh, wait a minute!

02:12:36.651 --> 02:12:40.989
There's more to come.
Lots of excess, like you love.

02:12:43.366 --> 02:12:47.995
You know, this is gonna be
a wonderful party.

02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:51.707
Yes, it is.

02:12:55.419 --> 02:12:58.380
Thank you. Thank you.

02:13:00.882 --> 02:13:04.343
- Happy birthday!
- Thanks.

02:13:29.575 --> 02:13:31.452
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

02:13:31.493 --> 02:13:34.246
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

02:13:39.250 --> 02:13:41.252
- Hello.
- Welcome.

02:13:41.336 --> 02:13:44.130
<i>- Hi, Susan.
- Hi, Simone. How are you?</i>

02:13:49.218 --> 02:13:52.679
- Hi, darling.
- Oh, hi, Gene. Hi.

02:14:19.788 --> 02:14:22.999
My father told me
you might be leaving.

02:14:24.083 --> 02:14:26.711
Your father and I...

02:14:26.794 --> 02:14:31.173
Our time together
has come to an end.

02:14:40.890 --> 02:14:44.727
I'm in love...
with a man,

02:14:46.145 --> 02:14:48.898
but I don't know
who he is,

02:14:48.981 --> 02:14:51.442
where he's going
or when.

02:14:54.403 --> 02:14:56.613
I can tell you
the when part.

02:14:58.073 --> 02:15:00.241
Tonight.

02:15:02.952 --> 02:15:05.538
So it does get worse.

02:15:05.621 --> 02:15:08.457
No worse
than it gets for me.

02:15:13.545 --> 02:15:16.631
I'm in love
with a woman who...

02:15:19.426 --> 02:15:21.753
I don't wanna leave.

02:15:22.595 --> 02:15:24.555
I don't wanna leave.

02:15:26.307 --> 02:15:28.476
Ohh.

02:15:28.559 --> 02:15:30.561
Then don't.

02:15:34.314 --> 02:15:37.901
There's so little
we know about each other.

02:15:37.943 --> 02:15:40.195
There's so much
I should tell you.

02:15:40.278 --> 02:15:43.906
That'll come.
That'll come.

02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:51.622
- Will it?
- Mm-hmm.

02:15:54.916 --> 02:15:57.544
I wanna be with you, Joe.

02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:09.221
I opened my big mouth
one too many times.

02:16:09.305 --> 02:16:12.474
Everything just got
all, uh, twisted.

02:16:12.516 --> 02:16:15.018
It's okay, Quince.
I understand.

02:16:15.102 --> 02:16:18.229
You've always meant well,
and I appreciate that.

02:16:18.313 --> 02:16:21.816
<i>Sometimes things
just turn out wrong.</i>

02:16:21.899 --> 02:16:23.860
<i>Yeah?</i>

02:16:25.695 --> 02:16:28.072
- Excuse me.
- No, no... Uh, Joe, come in.

02:16:28.155 --> 02:16:30.658
Um, I wanna thank you.
Is it okay, Bill?

02:16:30.741 --> 02:16:34.286
- Sure.
- Joe knows the whole story. I told him.

02:16:34.369 --> 02:16:38.039
And it was his idea that I come clean.
I mean...

02:16:38.123 --> 02:16:40.541
I wanted to come clean,
but, uh,

02:16:40.583 --> 02:16:43.920
he gave me a pair of balls,
you know what I mean?

02:16:44.003 --> 02:16:46.672
Yeah, I believe I do.

02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:54.554
Anyway, uh,

02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:57.307
I can see you guys
got business.

02:16:57.389 --> 02:17:01.977
<i>No. However, I do have
some unfinished business with Drew.</i>

02:17:02.102 --> 02:17:04.647
Get him on the helicopter.
Get him out here tonight.

02:17:04.689 --> 02:17:07.608
<i>I wanna tell this guy how I feel
about him face-to-face.</i>

02:17:07.691 --> 02:17:12.946
That could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt if
Drew is anxious to see you face-to-face.

02:17:18.951 --> 02:17:21.955
- I'll deliver the package.
- Okay.

02:17:34.132 --> 02:17:37.552
- How are you doing?
- What the hell do you care?

02:17:37.636 --> 02:17:40.388
Just asking, Bill.

02:17:42.849 --> 02:17:45.601
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.

02:17:45.684 --> 02:17:49.103
You're looking at a man who is not walking
through the valley of the shadow of death.

02:17:49.188 --> 02:17:51.773
He's galloping into it.
At the same time, the business he built...

02:17:51.857 --> 02:17:55.402
with his own hands and head has been
commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.

02:17:55.485 --> 02:17:59.322
Oh, yes! I almost forgot.
My daughter's fallen in love with Death.

02:17:59.364 --> 02:18:02.325
And I'm in love
with your daughter.

02:18:04.368 --> 02:18:06.329
Say again?

02:18:10.457 --> 02:18:14.419
I'm in love with your daughter,
and I'm taking her with me tonight.

02:18:15.587 --> 02:18:19.090
- You what?
- I think you heard me, Bill.

02:18:19.174 --> 02:18:22.635
You're not taking Susan anywhere.
What does that mean, anyway? We had a deal.

02:18:22.718 --> 02:18:25.471
And I'm sorry.

02:18:27.848 --> 02:18:31.101
Susan's my daughter.
She has a wonderful life ahead of her.

02:18:31.184 --> 02:18:34.313
You're gonna deprive her of it,
and you're telling me you're sorry?

02:18:34.396 --> 02:18:36.647
I'm sorry.
Apology not accepted.

02:18:36.731 --> 02:18:40.442
I don't care, Bill.
I love her.

02:18:41.903 --> 02:18:44.405
How perfect for you...

02:18:44.447 --> 02:18:48.075
to take whatever you want
because it pleases you.

02:18:48.159 --> 02:18:50.451
That's not love.

02:18:50.536 --> 02:18:52.663
Then what is it?

02:18:52.745 --> 02:18:57.291
Some aimless infatuation which,
for the moment, you feel like indulging.

02:18:57.375 --> 02:18:59.919
It's missing everything
that matters.

02:19:00.003 --> 02:19:01.838
Which is what?

02:19:01.921 --> 02:19:04.549
Trust, responsibility,

02:19:04.632 --> 02:19:06.592
taking the weight for
your choices and feelings...

02:19:06.634 --> 02:19:09.219
and spending the rest
of your life living up to them,

02:19:09.303 --> 02:19:13.056
and above all,
not hurting the object of your love.

02:19:13.139 --> 02:19:15.350
So that's love according
to William Parrish?

02:19:15.433 --> 02:19:18.477
Multiply it by infinity
and take it to the depth of forever,

02:19:18.561 --> 02:19:22.231
and you will still have barely a glimpse
of what I'm talking about.

02:19:22.315 --> 02:19:26.027
Those were my words.
They're mine now.

02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:31.406
Bill, Susan wants to come with me.
She loves me.

02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:33.492
- She loves you?
- Mm-hmm.

02:19:33.575 --> 02:19:35.994
<i>Who is you?
Did you tell her who you are?</i>

02:19:36.076 --> 02:19:40.415
- No.
- Does she know where she's going? Huh?

02:19:42.165 --> 02:19:45.169
You see, Susan went for
that poor son of a bitch...

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:48.339
whose body you took, and everything
since has been aftermath.

02:19:48.422 --> 02:19:50.382
You don't know what love is.

02:19:50.466 --> 02:19:52.384
She doesn't know who you are.

02:19:52.468 --> 02:19:56.721
You make a deal; you're breaking it.
Bottom line is, Joe,

02:19:56.805 --> 02:19:59.474
you're swindling her soul, and you're
doing it with your eyes wide open.

02:19:59.557 --> 02:20:03.019
- I don't like what you're saying.
- I'm past caring what you like and don't.

02:20:03.102 --> 02:20:05.613
You're stealing my daughter,
and I'm not gonna let you.

02:20:05.614 --> 02:20:06.314
You're not?

02:20:06.315 --> 02:20:08.023
- No.
- Are you threatening me?

02:20:08.107 --> 02:20:10.901
Yeah, I certainly hope so.

02:20:10.984 --> 02:20:12.903
Yeah.

02:20:15.197 --> 02:20:18.159
I loved Susan from
the moment she was born,

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:20.160
and I love her now and
every minute in between.

02:20:20.170 --> 02:20:22.546
And what I dream of
is a man who will

02:20:22.547 --> 02:20:24.225
discover her, and that
she will discover a man...

02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:27.792
who will love her, who is worthy of her,
who is of this world, this time...

02:20:27.875 --> 02:20:30.127
and has the grace, compassion
and fortitude to walk beside her...

02:20:30.210 --> 02:20:32.129
as she makes her way
through life.

02:20:32.212 --> 02:20:34.131
Enough!

02:20:36.424 --> 02:20:39.803
What I know is what I want,
and what I want is Susan.

02:20:39.886 --> 02:20:42.013
And I will have her,
and she will have me.

02:20:42.096 --> 02:20:46.892
And that's the way it's going to be.
And there's nothing you can do.

02:20:49.311 --> 02:20:51.855
Why did you
tell me all this, Joe?

02:20:51.897 --> 02:20:53.982
You're the big shot,
the biggest shot of all.

02:20:54.066 --> 02:20:58.028
You don't have to ask permission, but that's
what you're doing. Do you know why?

02:20:58.111 --> 02:21:02.156
<i>Because you've somehow developed into
a good guy, and you know this is all wrong.</i>

02:21:03.408 --> 02:21:06.285
I don't know what
you're gonna do, but, uh,

02:21:06.369 --> 02:21:08.412
how can this be love?

02:21:08.496 --> 02:21:11.248
She doesn't know who you are.

02:21:11.331 --> 02:21:15.627
<i>Why don't you tell her,
try it out, see what happens?</i>

02:21:15.628 --> 02:21:17.865
Reveal everything there
is to know about yourself

02:21:17.866 --> 02:21:20.200
and let the chips fall where they may.

02:21:24.135 --> 02:21:26.470
<i>Okay?</i>

02:21:29.723 --> 02:21:33.435
I've given it my best shot.
I, uh...

02:21:33.518 --> 02:21:37.480
I wish I could tell you
to sleep on it.

02:21:58.041 --> 02:22:00.960
Oh, um...

02:22:01.044 --> 02:22:03.504
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

02:22:03.588 --> 02:22:05.715
- Sure.
- Okay, nice to see you.

02:22:05.798 --> 02:22:08.175
Nice to see you.

02:22:23.940 --> 02:22:26.233
There's something
so indescribably sexy...

02:22:26.317 --> 02:22:28.736
about you standing
in the middle of a crowd.

02:22:28.819 --> 02:22:32.739
I could make love to you
right here.

02:22:44.333 --> 02:22:49.630
You're trying to tell me my future,
you're looking on the wrong side.

02:22:53.634 --> 02:22:57.095
There is something
I do want to tell you.

02:23:04.310 --> 02:23:06.270
But you can't?

02:23:13.569 --> 02:23:17.113
Just now when you hesitated,
I got a chill.

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:22.076
Remember that morning
in the coffee shop?

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:27.456
When you said, "What's wrong
with taking care of a woman?

02:23:27.498 --> 02:23:29.625
She takes care of you. "

02:23:32.336 --> 02:23:34.838
- Did I say that?
- Mm-hmm.

02:23:34.921 --> 02:23:40.176
And I said you'd have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

02:23:43.805 --> 02:23:45.973
Well, you found one, Joe.

02:23:47.850 --> 02:23:49.935
The coffee shop.

02:23:51.395 --> 02:23:56.483
That was the place,
and you were the guy.

02:23:59.027 --> 02:24:01.988
And you said that, uh,

02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:04.949
that you didn't want me
to be your doctor because...

02:24:05.032 --> 02:24:09.912
you didn't want me
to examine you.

02:24:09.995 --> 02:24:13.373
Why, I got to examine you,
after all.

02:24:22.882 --> 02:24:25.301
I could come with you.

02:24:29.138 --> 02:24:31.223
You want me to wait?

02:24:31.306 --> 02:24:34.059
You'll come back?

02:24:41.649 --> 02:24:44.318
May I kiss you?

02:25:10.801 --> 02:25:13.720
That felt like good-bye.

02:25:19.142 --> 02:25:22.353
What's going on, Joe?

02:25:22.437 --> 02:25:25.439
I feel like we're lifting off.

02:25:29.318 --> 02:25:31.320
I'm still here.

02:25:36.658 --> 02:25:39.160
But you're not.

02:25:41.204 --> 02:25:43.414
You're somewhere else.

02:26:20.448 --> 02:26:22.533
You're someone else.

02:26:27.121 --> 02:26:30.165
Don't you want to ask who?

02:26:31.458 --> 02:26:34.252
- Yes, but...
- "But"?

02:26:42.135 --> 02:26:44.428
Joe, I'm afraid.

02:26:45.471 --> 02:26:47.556
Afraid to find out?

02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.601
Don't be.

02:26:51.643 --> 02:26:55.856
It doesn't matter what I am.

02:26:55.939 --> 02:26:58.942
You know who I am.

02:27:07.908 --> 02:27:09.827
You're...

02:27:19.878 --> 02:27:22.547
You're...

02:27:42.357 --> 02:27:44.609
You're Joe.

02:27:51.281 --> 02:27:55.035
Yes, I'm Joe.

02:28:00.206 --> 02:28:03.000
Oh.

02:28:03.084 --> 02:28:05.461
And I promise you...

02:28:08.464 --> 02:28:13.719
you will always have what you
found in the coffee shop.

02:28:21.017 --> 02:28:25.062
Tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me now.

02:28:26.147 --> 02:28:29.108
I love you now.

02:28:29.149 --> 02:28:31.652
I'll love you always.

02:28:36.698 --> 02:28:38.992
Susan.

02:28:40.577 --> 02:28:42.662
Yes?

02:28:44.622 --> 02:28:47.166
Thank you for loving me.

02:29:16.776 --> 02:29:20.405
We should think about
getting started, Bill.

02:29:23.032 --> 02:29:24.992
Mm-hmm.

02:29:31.373 --> 02:29:34.042
It'll just be us.

02:29:37.879 --> 02:29:39.839
Thank you.

02:29:46.262 --> 02:29:48.389
Bill?

02:29:50.265 --> 02:29:52.893
Come in.

02:29:54.478 --> 02:29:57.981
I got him. The helicopter
will be here in two minutes.

02:29:58.064 --> 02:30:00.942
How are we on time?

02:30:01.025 --> 02:30:03.569
Okay.

02:30:03.653 --> 02:30:05.404
Get him in here.

02:30:05.446 --> 02:30:08.908
May?

02:30:08.949 --> 02:30:11.076
- Yes, sir?
- I know you're busy,

02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:13.453
but I want you to put in a call
to Eddie Sloane for me.

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:16.164
- At home, sir?
- No, he's at the office.

02:30:16.456 --> 02:30:19.584
This is damn big of Bill.

02:30:19.626 --> 02:30:21.669
- Ooh. You all right?
- Yeah.

02:30:21.753 --> 02:30:23.838
Also smart, you know?

02:30:23.921 --> 02:30:27.591
Well, he had no choice.
He knows you're a formidable adversary.

02:30:27.633 --> 02:30:28.831
He said that?

02:30:28.832 --> 02:30:31.032
Yeah, I mean,
you got him by the short hairs.

02:30:31.095 --> 02:30:33.096
Yeah, the short and gray hairs.

02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:36.016
<i>- We're all here, Bill.
- I appreciate this, Eddie.</i>

02:30:36.099 --> 02:30:41.104
Members of the board, this will
just take a minute of your time.

02:30:41.187 --> 02:30:45.858
As custodians of the company, you may
receive information from what follows...

02:30:45.942 --> 02:30:50.529
that will be valuable
to you or not.

02:30:50.612 --> 02:30:53.115
- Either way, thanks.
- We're all ears.

02:30:53.156 --> 02:30:54.616
<i>Thanks.</i>

02:30:57.327 --> 02:30:59.287
Good evening, Bill.

02:30:59.329 --> 02:31:01.664
Thank you, Quince.

02:31:01.706 --> 02:31:07.211
I just wanted to say how appreciative
I am of this, um, grand gesture.

02:31:07.294 --> 02:31:09.046
Shut up and sit down.

02:31:15.135 --> 02:31:17.554
<i>You're a useless sack
of shit, Drew.</i>

02:31:17.637 --> 02:31:19.639
You played footsie
with John Bontecou...

02:31:19.722 --> 02:31:22.183
so you could dismember my company
to line your own pockets.

02:31:22.225 --> 02:31:25.311
I don't know where you get
that idea. The board agreed...

02:31:25.394 --> 02:31:29.481
The board didn't know you were a mole who
burrowed inside so you could bury us all.

02:31:29.565 --> 02:31:32.860
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?
Another one of his whoppers?

02:31:32.901 --> 02:31:36.112
Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking
around? Nobody knows who he is.

02:31:36.196 --> 02:31:38.156
But one thing
everybody does know,

02:31:38.239 --> 02:31:41.868
he somehow got your ear and has
been pouring poison into it ever since.

02:31:41.909 --> 02:31:45.121
You're the poison, Drew.

02:31:45.204 --> 02:31:48.082
You've operated behind the scenes
to suborn the trust of a man...

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:51.919
who has stamped you with his imprimatur
of class, elegance and stature.

02:31:52.002 --> 02:31:56.673
<i>I've had the opportunity to be witness
to every kind and degree of deception.</i>

02:31:56.756 --> 02:32:00.385
But Bill Parrish has been on the receiving
end of machinations so Machiavellian...

02:32:00.426 --> 02:32:02.720
that it has rarely been
my experience to encounter.

02:32:02.762 --> 02:32:08.392
And yet, he has combatted them stoically and
selflessly, without revealing my identity.

02:32:08.434 --> 02:32:11.562
Had he violated
the vow of secrecy he took,

02:32:11.603 --> 02:32:14.189
<i>his task would
have been far easier.</i>

02:32:14.272 --> 02:32:17.192
<i>He could have turned
defeat into victory.</i>

02:32:17.275 --> 02:32:20.195
But he is too honorable a man
to have done that.

02:32:20.278 --> 02:32:25.616
Because of me, he has lost his work,
his company, his reputation.

02:32:25.658 --> 02:32:29.662
So now,
given these losses,

02:32:29.745 --> 02:32:34.207
I'm compelled to end
the need for secrecy.

02:32:35.792 --> 02:32:38.378
The time has come
to tell you who I am.

02:32:44.008 --> 02:32:46.969
So tell me. Tell me.
I'm peeing in my pants.

02:32:47.053 --> 02:32:49.930
- And you're going to pee some more.
- Joe, don't do this.

02:32:50.014 --> 02:32:52.641
It's okay, Bill. It's time
we put this person in his place.

02:32:52.724 --> 02:32:55.477
<i>It's not necessary, Joe.
Drew's gonna step aside.</i>

02:32:55.519 --> 02:32:58.605
- I'm not stepping anywhere.
- I appreciate your gentlemanliness.

02:32:58.688 --> 02:33:00.815
But what we need to do here
is drive the dagger home.

02:33:00.899 --> 02:33:03.276
- "The dagger"?
- I told you to shut up!

02:33:03.359 --> 02:33:05.820
Prepare yourself, Drew.

02:33:05.903 --> 02:33:08.447
<i>- I...
- Joe, please.</i>

02:33:08.531 --> 02:33:10.324
Kindly let me
take it from here.

02:33:10.407 --> 02:33:12.159
<i>- Am...
- Don't.</i>

02:33:16.997 --> 02:33:20.166
An agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

02:33:27.923 --> 02:33:28.924
- Bill?
- Huh?

02:33:29.008 --> 02:33:30.676
Bill.

02:33:34.429 --> 02:33:35.889
- Bill.
- Yeah.

02:33:35.931 --> 02:33:39.601
Yes, he's, um...

02:33:39.684 --> 02:33:42.895
He's an agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

02:33:42.979 --> 02:33:45.856
Mmm, yes, we were convinced
that Bontecou, on past deals,

02:33:45.898 --> 02:33:47.900
has structured his mergers
and acquisitions...

02:33:47.983 --> 02:33:52.237
in suspicious and complicated ways so as
to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.

02:33:52.238 --> 02:33:57.242
<i>The agency asked Bill for his cooperation in
an undercover investigation of Bontecou.</i>

02:33:57.325 --> 02:34:03.247
We wanted to go after him, and this deal
gave us that perfect opportunity.

02:34:03.289 --> 02:34:07.751
- And I offered to cooperate.
- And we're very grateful.

02:34:07.793 --> 02:34:12.422
Uh, Agent Joe Black here...
Of course, that's not his real name...

02:34:12.506 --> 02:34:14.508
smelled out
your involvement, Drew.

02:34:14.591 --> 02:34:18.720
<i>He developed evidence you were
working both sides of the fence.</i>

02:34:18.803 --> 02:34:23.141
Unfortunately, that is what is
known as a conflict of interest.

02:34:23.182 --> 02:34:25.184
Undisclosed conflict of interest.

02:34:25.268 --> 02:34:27.478
- An offense.
- An indictable offense.

02:34:27.520 --> 02:34:30.856
- And a likely conviction.
- Very likely.

02:34:30.939 --> 02:34:33.859
I think I'd like
to talk to my lawyer.

02:34:33.942 --> 02:34:38.446
No lawyers, Drew.
Uh, we're gonna offer you a deal.

02:34:38.530 --> 02:34:42.158
Confess to the board every detail of your
participation, then submit your resignation.

02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:43.868
What do I get?

02:34:43.951 --> 02:34:45.620
You get not to go to jail.

02:34:45.703 --> 02:34:47.788
You're talking
through your hat.

02:34:47.872 --> 02:34:50.374
You're offering me a deal
because you've got no proof.

02:34:50.457 --> 02:34:54.544
Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
He's talking through his lips.

02:34:54.628 --> 02:34:58.673
Drew, make no mistake. Should you
choose to test my resolve in this matter,

02:34:58.715 --> 02:35:01.509
you will be looking at an outcome
that will have a finality...

02:35:01.551 --> 02:35:03.845
that is beyond
your comprehension.

02:35:03.928 --> 02:35:07.890
And you will not be counting
the days or the months or the years,

02:35:07.973 --> 02:35:11.268
but millenniums
in a place with no doors.

02:35:14.229 --> 02:35:16.648
All right, you win.

02:35:16.731 --> 02:35:19.067
Soon as I get back to the city,
I'll meet with the board.

02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:22.278
<i>You're meeting with the board
right now, Drew. Resignation accepted.</i>

02:35:22.362 --> 02:35:26.657
Moreover, I propose a motion
to reconfirm William Parrish...

02:35:26.741 --> 02:35:29.827
as chairman of the board
of Parrish Communications,

02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:33.622
<i>as well as a rejection of the merger
with Bontecou International.</i>

02:35:33.705 --> 02:35:37.042
<i>- How say you, board?
- Yes.</i>

02:35:37.083 --> 02:35:39.419
<i>- Yes.
- The motion is passed.</i>

02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.588
<i>Thank you. That's great.</i>

02:35:41.671 --> 02:35:45.466
But it's more than I bargained for.
I just wanted to set the record straight.

02:35:45.549 --> 02:35:49.762
<i>You have. Sounds like these guys want you
back, Bill. We'll get their apologies later.</i>

02:35:49.845 --> 02:35:53.724
<i>Meanwhile, enjoy your party. Celebrate.
I'll attend to the nasty details.</i>

02:35:53.765 --> 02:35:56.268
And, Mr. Black,
may we say thank you?

02:35:56.351 --> 02:35:59.437
My pleasure.
This is an I.R.S. Agent's dream.

02:35:59.521 --> 02:36:01.689
I'll be promoted
chief of section off this.

02:36:08.404 --> 02:36:11.448
Who would have believed it?

02:36:11.532 --> 02:36:13.700
You an I.R.S. Agent?

02:36:16.328 --> 02:36:19.414
Death and taxes.

02:36:27.588 --> 02:36:31.133
<i>~ Happy birthday to you ~</i>

02:36:31.216 --> 02:36:34.553
~ Happy birthday to you ~

02:36:34.636 --> 02:36:40.141
~ Happy birthday
dear William ~

02:36:40.225 --> 02:36:45.896
~ Happy birthday to you ~

02:37:28.144 --> 02:37:31.146
Speech! Speech!
Speech!

02:37:31.230 --> 02:37:36.067
Speech! Speech! Speech!

02:37:36.151 --> 02:37:38.570
Thank you.

02:37:40.905 --> 02:37:45.910
- I thought I was gonna sneak away tonight.
- No!

02:37:47.995 --> 02:37:51.039
What a glorious night.

02:37:51.123 --> 02:37:53.583
Every face I see is a memory.

02:37:53.625 --> 02:37:58.588
It may not be a perfectly
perfect memory.

02:37:58.671 --> 02:38:04.177
Uh, sometimes we had
our ups and downs.

02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:06.595
But we're all together,

02:38:06.721 --> 02:38:10.057
and you're mine for a night.

02:38:13.018 --> 02:38:18.815
And I'm gonna break precedent
and tell you my one candle wish.

02:38:18.898 --> 02:38:22.068
That you would have a life
as lucky as mine,

02:38:22.151 --> 02:38:27.156
<i>where you can wake up
one morning and say,</i>

02:38:27.239 --> 02:38:30.284
"I don't want anything more. "

02:38:39.417 --> 02:38:43.337
Sixty-five years.

02:38:43.379 --> 02:38:46.924
Don't they go by in a blink?

02:39:29.922 --> 02:39:31.882
Hi.

02:39:31.965 --> 02:39:35.552
Oh. What a night.

02:39:35.635 --> 02:39:39.264
I'm having a hell of a time.

02:39:42.016 --> 02:39:45.770
You were right... about Joe.

02:39:45.853 --> 02:39:48.647
He, uh...

02:39:48.731 --> 02:39:50.649
He is going somewhere.

02:39:52.484 --> 02:39:54.486
I'm sorry.

02:39:56.821 --> 02:39:59.074
You relieved?

02:40:00.158 --> 02:40:03.286
Yes, but...

02:40:03.327 --> 02:40:05.830
But what?

02:40:12.085 --> 02:40:14.796
I want you to know
how much I love you,

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:18.174
that you've given a meaning to my life
that I had no right to expect,

02:40:18.258 --> 02:40:20.760
that no one can
ever take from me.

02:40:20.843 --> 02:40:22.970
- Dad...
- No!

02:40:23.012 --> 02:40:27.099
I love you so much.

02:40:27.183 --> 02:40:30.102
And I want you
to promise me something.

02:40:30.185 --> 02:40:34.690
I don't want you
to ever worry about me.

02:40:34.773 --> 02:40:38.276
And if anything should happen,
I'm gonna be okay.

02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:41.279
And everything's
gonna be all right.

02:40:41.362 --> 02:40:43.281
And I have no regrets.

02:40:43.364 --> 02:40:46.701
And I want you
to feel the same way.

02:40:52.456 --> 02:40:54.374
I love you, Daddy.

02:40:54.458 --> 02:40:57.210
That's why it's okay.

02:41:02.548 --> 02:41:04.509
No regrets?

02:41:06.302 --> 02:41:08.345
No regrets.

02:41:08.429 --> 02:41:10.681
That's a good feeling, isn't it?

02:41:10.764 --> 02:41:13.433
Yeah.

02:41:17.479 --> 02:41:19.731
Everybody's saying good-bye.

02:41:22.650 --> 02:41:25.069
I'm still here.

02:41:26.946 --> 02:41:29.448
Would you like to dance
with me, Susan?

02:41:32.409 --> 02:41:34.619
Yeah.

02:41:39.874 --> 02:41:42.543
If you don't mind dancing
with an old fogey like me.

02:41:42.627 --> 02:41:47.798
Oh, Dad, you're not old.

02:41:52.135 --> 02:41:54.763
You'll never be old.

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:01.436
Can I get you anything, sir?

02:42:01.477 --> 02:42:04.605
No.

02:42:04.689 --> 02:42:07.191
Do you have any peanut butter?

02:42:08.567 --> 02:42:10.778
Uh, I don't think so, sir.

02:42:10.819 --> 02:42:15.574
Mmm. Thank you anyway.

02:42:15.657 --> 02:42:18.159
You're welcome.

02:43:57.125 --> 02:43:59.461
What's that?

02:43:59.502 --> 02:44:02.046
The fireworks are starting.

02:44:02.130 --> 02:44:05.299
Let's go down and watch.

02:44:09.178 --> 02:44:13.140
- Shall we?
- You go on ahead, honey.

02:44:13.181 --> 02:44:15.767
I'm just gonna catch my breath.

02:44:23.941 --> 02:44:25.860
Okay.

02:44:44.252 --> 02:44:46.212
Okay.

02:45:59.863 --> 02:46:02.365
Happy birthday, Bill.

02:46:02.448 --> 02:46:04.367
Thank you.

02:46:07.161 --> 02:46:09.580
Did you say good-bye?

02:46:09.663 --> 02:46:12.583
Not exactly.

02:46:12.666 --> 02:46:16.211
I guess you have your reasons.

02:46:16.294 --> 02:46:18.213
Yes.

02:46:24.427 --> 02:46:26.971
Now that we have a moment,

02:46:27.054 --> 02:46:31.100
would you mind if I expressed my
gratitude for what you did for Susan?

02:46:33.894 --> 02:46:38.565
I've never heard her speak of
any man as she spoke of you.

02:46:38.648 --> 02:46:41.693
That's what I always
wanted for her.

02:46:44.028 --> 02:46:46.947
But what happens
to her now?

02:46:48.199 --> 02:46:50.909
I wouldn't worry about it, Bill.

02:46:50.993 --> 02:46:53.954
These things have a way
of working out.

02:46:57.332 --> 02:47:01.252
Would you mind if
I expressed my gratitude?

02:47:02.628 --> 02:47:05.339
For you,

02:47:05.423 --> 02:47:08.050
for the time
you've given me,

02:47:08.133 --> 02:47:10.302
for the person you are.

02:47:12.930 --> 02:47:17.600
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
You'll ruin my autopsy.

02:47:28.652 --> 02:47:31.280
It's hard to let go, isn't it?

02:47:35.158 --> 02:47:37.160
Yes, it is, Bill.

02:47:39.287 --> 02:47:42.373
Well, that's life.

02:47:42.457 --> 02:47:44.959
What can I tell you?

02:48:19.365 --> 02:48:21.326
Should I be afraid?

02:48:23.327 --> 02:48:25.496
Not a man like you.

02:49:57.163 --> 02:49:59.082
You're here.

02:50:03.711 --> 02:50:05.671
You bet.

02:50:08.883 --> 02:50:11.385
Well, where did you go?

02:50:12.803 --> 02:50:16.223
I don't know.

02:50:16.264 --> 02:50:18.224
I don't...

02:50:23.104 --> 02:50:27.233
I... I don't know,
you know. I...

02:50:29.068 --> 02:50:33.864
It's all kind of blurred up
and hazy, but...

02:50:33.905 --> 02:50:38.910
Would you know what I mean if I said
I don't think I'll ever figure it out?

02:50:42.872 --> 02:50:45.041
But now I'm back.

02:50:50.212 --> 02:50:52.130
That's it?

02:50:56.426 --> 02:51:00.180
Well, I don't know what else to say.
Looks like a hell of a party.

02:51:03.141 --> 02:51:05.601
You think so?

02:51:08.062 --> 02:51:10.981
You look beautiful.

02:51:12.316 --> 02:51:14.776
When you disappeared
around the corner,

02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:19.781
I wasn't sure if I was
ever gonna see you again.

02:51:30.708 --> 02:51:32.709
Hey, are you all right?

02:51:41.551 --> 02:51:45.346
- The coffee shop.
- Yep.

02:51:45.388 --> 02:51:50.184
I asked you if I said something wrong and
you said no, it was so right it scared you.

02:51:50.267 --> 02:51:53.020
And then you said...

02:51:53.103 --> 02:51:58.400
Forgive me for saying this,
but it's been with me ever since.

02:52:01.569 --> 02:52:03.488
What has?

02:52:04.947 --> 02:52:07.074
You said you liked me.

02:52:10.911 --> 02:52:14.081
- No.
- You didn't?

02:52:15.624 --> 02:52:20.712
I said...
I liked you so much.

02:52:30.429 --> 02:52:33.056
Yeah.

02:52:33.098 --> 02:52:35.767
We know so little
about each other.

02:52:38.728 --> 02:52:41.064
But we've got time.

02:52:43.691 --> 02:52:45.609
Yeah.

02:52:54.826 --> 02:52:57.829
I wish you...

02:53:01.165 --> 02:53:03.960
could've known my father.

02:53:06.128 --> 02:53:08.505
Me too.

02:53:12.259 --> 02:53:14.177
Me too.

02:53:20.934 --> 02:53:22.852
What do we do now?

02:53:26.564 --> 02:53:29.024
It'll come to us.

02:53:30.359 --> 02:53:32.277
Yeah.

02:55:03.528 --> 02:55:06.614
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:55:06.697 --> 02:55:09.700
<i>~ Over the rainbow ~</i>

02:55:10.784 --> 02:55:13.870
<i>~ Way up high ~</i>

02:55:15.163 --> 02:55:20.543
<i>~ And the dreams
that you dream of ~</i>

02:55:20.627 --> 02:55:26.627
<i>~ Once in a lullaby ~</i>

02:55:26.716 --> 02:55:29.134
<i>~ By, oh ~</i>

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:31.970
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:55:32.054 --> 02:55:35.223
<i>~ Over the rainbow ~</i>

02:55:36.308 --> 02:55:39.394
<i>~ Bluebirds fly ~</i>

02:55:40.562 --> 02:55:46.150
<i>~ And the dreams
that you dream of ~</i>

02:55:46.233 --> 02:55:52.030
<i>~ Dreams really do come true ~</i>

02:55:52.072 --> 02:55:54.241
<i>~ Ooo-ooo ~</i>

02:55:54.324 --> 02:55:57.369
<i>~ Some day you wish
upon a star ~</i>

02:55:57.452 --> 02:56:01.998
<i>~ Wake up where the clouds
are far behind ~</i>

02:56:03.291 --> 02:56:08.587
<i>~ Be where trouble melts
like lemon drops ~</i>

02:56:08.671 --> 02:56:11.256
<i>~ High above the chimney top ~</i>

02:56:11.340 --> 02:56:14.051
<i>~ It's where ~</i>

02:56:14.092 --> 02:56:17.137
<i>~ You find me, oh ~</i>

02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:19.931
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:56:20.014 --> 02:56:23.184
<i>~ Over the rainbow ~</i>

02:56:24.310 --> 02:56:27.438
<i>~ Bluebirds fly ~</i>

02:56:28.647 --> 02:56:33.777
<i>~ And the dreams
that you dare to ~</i>

02:56:33.819 --> 02:56:36.446
<i>~ Oh, why, oh, why ~</i>

02:56:36.530 --> 02:56:41.326
<i>~ Can't I, I ~</i>

02:56:41.409 --> 02:56:44.412
<i>~ Well, I see trees of green ~</i>

02:56:44.495 --> 02:56:47.998
<i>~ And red roses too ~</i>

02:56:48.082 --> 02:56:51.627
<i>~ I'll watch them bloom for ~</i>

02:56:51.668 --> 02:56:57.132
<i>~ Me and you
and I think to myself ~</i>

02:56:57.215 --> 02:57:01.844
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:07.224
<i>~ Well, I see skies of blue ~</i>

02:57:07.308 --> 02:57:10.060
<i>~ And I see clouds of white ~</i>

02:57:10.144 --> 02:57:13.939
<i>~ And the brightness of day ~</i>

02:57:14.022 --> 02:57:15.941
<i>~ I like the dark ~</i>

02:57:16.024 --> 02:57:19.861
<i>~ And I think to myself ~</i>

02:57:19.903 --> 02:57:24.282
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:57:27.451 --> 02:57:30.204
<i>~ The colors of the rainbow ~</i>

02:57:30.287 --> 02:57:33.040
<i>~ So pretty in the sky ~</i>

02:57:33.123 --> 02:57:35.792
<i>~ Are also on the faces ~</i>

02:57:35.876 --> 02:57:38.420
<i>~ Of people passing by ~</i>

02:57:38.503 --> 02:57:41.005
<i>~ I see friends shaking hands ~</i>

02:57:41.047 --> 02:57:44.800
<i>~ Saying, how do you do ~</i>

02:57:44.884 --> 02:57:47.303
<i>~ They're really saying ~</i>

02:57:47.386 --> 02:57:51.390
<i>~ I, I love you ~</i>

02:57:52.474 --> 02:57:55.227
<i>~ I hear babies cry ~</i>

02:57:55.268 --> 02:57:58.396
<i>~ And I watch them grow ~</i>

02:57:58.480 --> 02:58:01.733
<i>~ They'll learn much more ~</i>

02:58:01.816 --> 02:58:03.860
<i>~ Than we'll know ~</i>

02:58:03.943 --> 02:58:07.404
<i>~ And I think to myself ~</i>

02:58:07.488 --> 02:58:12.951
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:58:12.993 --> 02:58:14.911
<i>~ World ~</i>

02:58:14.995 --> 02:58:18.081
<i>~ Some day I wish upon a star ~</i>

02:58:18.164 --> 02:58:22.126
<i>~ Wake up where the clouds
are far behind ~</i>

02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:29.258
<i>~ Be where trouble melts
like lemon drops ~</i>

02:58:29.341 --> 02:58:31.927
<i>~ High above the chimney top ~</i>

02:58:31.969 --> 02:58:34.513
<i>~ That's where ~</i>

02:58:34.596 --> 02:58:37.766
<i>~ You'll find me, oh ~</i>

02:58:37.849 --> 02:58:40.685
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:58:40.768 --> 02:58:43.771
<i>~ Over the rainbow ~</i>

02:58:44.981 --> 02:58:48.067
<i>~ Way up high ~</i>

02:58:49.276 --> 02:58:54.740
<i>~ And the dreams
that you dare to ~</i>

02:58:54.823 --> 02:59:00.787
<i>~ Why, oh, why, can't I ~</i>

02:59:00.828 --> 02:59:03.331
<i>~ I ~</i>
