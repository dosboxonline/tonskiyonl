WEBVTT

00:02.919 --> 00:06.840
Doctor Stephen Strange, a neurosurgeon,

00:07.257 --> 00:10.677
who, after a terrible accident,
lost the use of his hands.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.389
<i>You might even say,</i>
<i>his hands betrayed him.</i>

00:14.806 --> 00:17.267
And I can relate. If you catch my drift.

00:18.727 --> 00:22.313
<i>Anyway, this Strange guy couldn't</i>
<i>cut it in the operating room anymore,</i>

00:23.064 --> 00:24.149
so what did he do?

00:24.607 --> 00:27.527
Run home and cry to mama? No-siree-bob.

00:27.610 --> 00:32.240
He picked himself up and trained
to be some kind of fancy-pants wizard,

00:32.657 --> 00:35.785
<i>complete with a kooky cape,</i>
<i>and a groovy goatee.</i>

00:37.120 --> 00:41.041
And yet, they still call him a doctor.
Know why?

00:41.124 --> 00:44.627
Because now, he's a doctor of kicking butt
and taking names.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.467
<i>Strange has mopped the floor</i>
<i>with cosmic conquerors, mad Titans,</i>

00:50.759 --> 00:52.802
<i>and guys with really bad complexions.</i>

00:53.511 --> 00:56.014
But enough with
the CliffsNotes recap already.

00:56.097 --> 00:59.267
These days, Strange is up to
his medallion-wearing neck

00:59.350 --> 01:01.227
in psychedelic scary sauce,

01:01.770 --> 01:03.438
and that is what we're here to talk about.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.732
<i>I'm Bruce Campbell, and I'll be your host</i>

01:05.815 --> 01:09.110
as we journey beyond the confines
of our own humdrum reality,

01:09.444 --> 01:13.156
and see what's really cookin'
in the <i>Multiverse of Madness.</i>

01:22.999 --> 01:24.959
KEVIN FEIGE: <i>After we finished</i>
<i>the Infinity Saga,</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:28.505
we were looking at how to evolve
post <i>Endgame</i>

01:28.838 --> 01:30.423
<i>and into phase four.</i>

01:30.965 --> 01:33.718
<i>We wanted to explore</i>
<i>entirely new characters</i>

01:33.802 --> 01:36.596
<i>and entirely new sides</i>
<i>of the Marvel comics.</i>

01:37.806 --> 01:41.351
<i>One of the things we're exploring</i>
<i>in phase four is the Multiverse.</i>

01:41.893 --> 01:46.731
<i>And in the Multiverse, we get to see</i>
<i>different realities and different outcomes</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:50.777
<i>of characters that we all know and love</i>
<i>in an infinite number of ways.</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:54.447
<i>Some of them are tragic,</i>
<i>some of them are horrific,</i>

01:54.906 --> 01:56.783
<i>all of them are unexpected.</i>

01:57.158 --> 02:01.621
<i>And that was always where we were headed</i>
<i>with this sequel to</i> Doctor Strange,

02:01.704 --> 02:04.874
<i>knowing that we wanted to explore</i>
<i>the mind-bending,</i>

02:04.958 --> 02:07.001
<i>frightening side of the Multiverse.</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:11.589
<i>And this could only have been done</i>
<i>under the direction of Sam Raimi.</i>

02:12.590 --> 02:16.010
RAIMI: <i>I got a call from my agent saying</i>
<i>that Kevin Feige and the Marvel team</i>

02:16.094 --> 02:19.305
<i>were looking for a new director</i>
<i>for the new</i> Doctor Strange <i>movie.</i>

02:19.389 --> 02:21.057
I was a big fan of the first one.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.394
I thought that the director,
Scott Derrickson, did a great job

02:24.477 --> 02:27.188
<i>and Benedict Cumberbatch delivered</i>
<i>an incredible performance.</i>

02:27.480 --> 02:31.609
So when that offer came and I thought,
"Okay, it's been a long time since I had

02:31.693 --> 02:33.903
<i>"made a superhero movie,</i>
<i>I wonder if I can still do it?"</i>

02:33.987 --> 02:36.447
And that alone was reason enough.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.993
RICHIE PALMER: <i>Sam Raimi is one of</i>
<i>the godfathers of the MCU,</i>

02:40.076 --> 02:42.537
if you think about it,
with the <i>Spider-Man</i> trilogy.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.664
<i>To get to work with Sam</i>
<i>is a dream come true,</i>

02:44.747 --> 02:47.709
not just for me, but for most
of the people on this set.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.712
That guy's movies are part of the reason
I became a writer,

02:50.795 --> 02:54.591
so, to have Sam Raimi come in a room
and sit across from you and be like,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.050
"All right, kid, what's the movie?"

02:56.134 --> 02:59.596
<i>Man, it's really a case of</i>
<i>meet your heroes.</i>

02:59.762 --> 03:03.057
So, I was a very junior part
of the creative team

03:03.141 --> 03:07.520
on his original <i>Spider-Man</i> films,
and now working so closely with him,

03:07.604 --> 03:09.147
<i>who would have guessed, certainly not me,</i>

03:09.230 --> 03:11.816
that nearly 20 years later,
Sam Raimi would be working

03:11.900 --> 03:13.193
on a <i>Doctor Strange</i> movie for us.

03:14.611 --> 03:19.449
We are in the Sanctum Sanctorum,
Doctor Strange's home,

03:19.532 --> 03:24.120
his weird, haunted house that he lives in,
and today's day one.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.165
RAIMI: <i>I think it was</i>
<i>always in Marvel's mind</i>

03:27.248 --> 03:30.501
that this film would really open the door
wide to the Multiverse.

03:31.836 --> 03:35.215
The scale is epic.
It's almost unfathomable.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.050
FEIGE: <i>That's part of the madness.</i>

03:37.133 --> 03:40.595
Madness of handling this many characters
and this many storylines.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.352
CAMPBELL: <i>So, this Multiverse</i>
<i>that everybody and their uncle</i>

03:47.435 --> 03:48.895
<i>keeps yackin' about,</i>

03:48.978 --> 03:50.563
<i>what is it anyway?</i>

03:50.647 --> 03:53.858
Well, I looked up Multiverse
in the dictionary.

03:53.942 --> 03:57.028
Yes, I cracked open an actual book,
and this is what it said.

03:57.987 --> 04:01.282
"An infinite realm of being
or potential being

04:01.783 --> 04:05.787
"of which the universe is regarded as
a part or instance."

04:06.037 --> 04:09.749
(LAUGHS) I don't know what
any of that means, but I'll wager,

04:09.832 --> 04:12.335
it has something to do
with endless possibilities.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.004
So, if you're aiming to tell a story

04:15.088 --> 04:17.924
set in a world
where literally anything goes,

04:18.633 --> 04:21.511
how do you even begin to begin?

04:22.887 --> 04:28.977
Yes, it's a maddening job,
that can make you go insane

04:29.060 --> 04:32.105
trying to figure all the stuff out,
but it's a lot of fun.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.109
RAIMI: <i>Telling the story of the Multiverse</i>
<i>was such a gigantic endeavor.</i>

04:36.192 --> 04:38.945
<i>To not only paint an accurate picture</i>
<i>of our universe,</i>

04:39.028 --> 04:41.990
but of another, and another, and another.

04:43.074 --> 04:46.744
<i>It took teams of really great artists</i>
<i>and Michael Waldron's great script,</i>

04:46.828 --> 04:48.246
which I just thought was brilliant.

04:49.539 --> 04:53.001
WALDRON: <i>It was February 2020,</i>

04:53.584 --> 04:56.504
<i>and Kevin Feige called me</i>

04:56.587 --> 04:58.172
and said
"We'll go in a different direction

04:58.256 --> 05:00.717
"on <i>Doctor Strange Two,</i>

05:00.800 --> 05:04.262
"and we want you to come over
and write it."

05:04.345 --> 05:06.973
<i>There were already sets being built</i>
<i>and everything</i>

05:07.056 --> 05:09.309
<i>so we really had to</i>
<i>hit the ground running.</i>

05:09.392 --> 05:13.354
But I think I had, like, three weeks
to try and write that first draft,

05:13.813 --> 05:19.652
and that last week is
when the NBA shut down, COVID hit,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.112
<i>and the world stopped spinning.</i>

05:21.195 --> 05:25.533
And so, it was an interesting month,
to say the least.

05:26.117 --> 05:32.248
The silver lining was production pushed
from May of 2020 to November of 2020,

05:32.332 --> 05:33.875
so it allowed us the time.

05:33.958 --> 05:36.669
<i>We said, "All right,</i>
<i>let's blow this thing up entirely,</i>

05:36.753 --> 05:38.421
"let's start from scratch."

05:38.504 --> 05:40.506
And that's exactly what we did.

05:40.590 --> 05:44.302
<i>And we threw that draft of mine</i>
<i>out entirely</i>

05:44.385 --> 05:48.556
<i>and said, "If we were in on day one</i>
<i>of this movie with Sam Raimi,</i>

05:48.639 --> 05:50.350
"what is the movie we would make?"

05:50.433 --> 05:54.020
And we came up with something better
and much more exciting.

05:54.729 --> 05:58.900
DOUG LEFLER: <i>Michael did a Herculean job</i>
<i>with this project, in my humble opinion.</i>

05:58.983 --> 06:02.362
He had all the history of Marvel
that he had to work into this.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.446
Ready.

06:03.529 --> 06:08.409
How he managed to balance all of that,
I think, was extraordinary.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.078
RAIMI: And, action!

06:15.500 --> 06:17.335
Nailed that, that was sharp.

06:18.920 --> 06:22.048
WALDRON: <i>What's interesting in a story</i>
<i>about the Multiverse</i>

06:22.131 --> 06:26.010
is exploring the other ways
that things could have played out.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.263
It's especially interesting with
a character that we saw at one point

06:29.347 --> 06:31.808
sit with his head going
in a million different directions,

06:32.350 --> 06:36.312
<i>watching 14 million different outcomes</i>
<i>in his particular universe.</i>

06:37.355 --> 06:39.649
Getting to work on a <i>Doctor Strange</i> sequel
is really exciting

06:39.732 --> 06:42.902
because the first movie really blew open
the doors of the MCU

06:42.985 --> 06:46.697
<i>in ways that we couldn't even imagine,</i>
<i>because you can't tell the same stories</i>

06:46.781 --> 06:48.866
<i>with Captain America that you could</i>
<i>with Doctor Strange.</i>

06:49.659 --> 06:53.955
RAIMI: <i>Marvel comic books have always been</i>
<i>excellent at painting complex characters.</i>

06:54.455 --> 06:57.458
It's how in the '60s and '70s
they blew DC out of the water.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.962
<i>They're able to build upon</i>
<i>these relationships with great depth,</i>

07:01.254 --> 07:03.297
<i>and we're able to build upon them</i>
<i>movie after movie.</i>

07:03.798 --> 07:07.468
He's been through a lot,
he's lost the use of his hands,

07:07.552 --> 07:12.348
<i>become a sorcerer, assumed this mantle</i>
<i>as master of the New York Sanctum,</i>

07:12.682 --> 07:15.101
<i>fought in a war against Thanos,</i>

07:15.184 --> 07:18.896
<i>gave up the Time Stone</i>
<i>in this incredible gambit</i>

07:18.980 --> 07:21.941
<i>that resulted in saving the universe,</i>

07:22.650 --> 07:26.279
<i>and he's kind of been dropped back</i>
<i>into normal life.</i>

07:27.947 --> 07:32.034
RAIMI: <i>The first film did a great job of</i>
<i>describing the journey of Doctor Strange.</i>

07:33.369 --> 07:37.331
<i>This film, it's about what he's become,</i>
<i>the price he's had to pay</i>

07:37.415 --> 07:40.585
<i>to become this great sorcerer</i>
<i>and savior of the universe.</i>

07:41.252 --> 07:44.881
I felt, I guess as much as the audience
and the fans did, that, you know,

07:44.964 --> 07:48.259
<i>this extraordinary character</i>
<i>seemed to be sort of</i>

07:48.676 --> 07:52.180
<i>all-powerful and perfect,</i>
<i>I wanted to know what it was about him,</i>

07:52.263 --> 07:54.390
how he'd got there
as much as anything else.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.894
<i>I wondered what it was costing him</i>
<i>or what it would cost him</i>

07:57.977 --> 08:02.982
<i>to continue developing in that way,</i>
<i>accruing power and ability.</i>

08:03.524 --> 08:05.234
Really, the film's
an examination of that,

08:05.318 --> 08:09.989
<i>how far as a maverick and an outsider,</i>
<i>and a chancer, and an ego</i>

08:10.364 --> 08:14.160
can he go
before stuff really becomes undone?

08:14.869 --> 08:17.914
It's always great in these solo flights,
to kind of shake the snow globe up

08:17.997 --> 08:19.790
and disturb the character

08:20.583 --> 08:23.544
and throw stuff at him
that really makes him question his purpose

08:23.628 --> 08:26.589
and who he is and how to best be.

08:26.797 --> 08:29.258
I never stopped caring about us.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.052
But I had to make sacrifices.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.012
I'm sorry.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.265
It's quite an emotional place
that he's in at the beginning.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.186
Then he's sort of slungshot
into this adventure.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.314
WALDRON: <i>We're in New York City.</i>

08:43.397 --> 08:48.736
A giant monstrous octopus
has attacked New York, it's bad news.

08:48.819 --> 08:51.948
RAIMI: Three, two, one, action.

08:54.492 --> 08:58.287
This is where Doctor Strange
meets America Chavez.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.789
Look out!

09:04.043 --> 09:05.795
Do I know you?

09:06.879 --> 09:10.508
WALDRON: <i>Through this adventure,</i>
<i>he forms the unlikely partnership</i>

09:10.591 --> 09:12.343
<i>with the young America Chavez,</i>

09:12.426 --> 09:16.097
the last person you'd expect
Doctor Strange to work with.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.976
America Chavez has been on a list
for a long time of characters

09:20.059 --> 09:22.186
<i>that we wanted to bring into the MCU.</i>

09:22.270 --> 09:26.649
America Chavez was created in 2011,
so she is a relatively new character.

09:27.358 --> 09:28.943
<i>Casting America Chavez was great,</i>

09:29.026 --> 09:31.153
it was such a highlight
of this experience,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.114
<i>we did such a wide search.</i>

09:33.197 --> 09:35.658
We found Xochitl Gomez
and thought unanimously

09:35.741 --> 09:37.660
<i>she was the best person for this role.</i>

09:37.743 --> 09:41.163
I did my first audition in March, 2020,

09:41.247 --> 09:42.790
<i>and I didn't hear anything</i>
<i>for six months.</i>

09:42.873 --> 09:45.209
<i>And then I got a call to do a screen test</i>
<i>in London.</i>

09:45.293 --> 09:49.005
That's when I got told what character
it was for and I was like, "Oh, my gosh."

09:49.797 --> 09:51.716
GRAHAM CHURCHYARD:
<i>We started with the comics,</i>

09:51.799 --> 09:54.260
<i>the denim jackets in many of the comics,</i>

09:54.343 --> 09:57.888
<i>and I designed these combat jackets</i>
<i>which had red, white, and blue,</i>

09:57.972 --> 10:01.350
<i>like, stars and stripes flag</i>
<i>that was all kind of blended together</i>

10:01.434 --> 10:03.894
in this camouflage,
so it was a camouflage jacket.

10:03.978 --> 10:07.356
America dresses a lot like I do.
I do wear black ripped jeans

10:07.440 --> 10:11.652
and a T-shirt and a nice jacket over it,
and a pony, I wear that all the time.

10:11.736 --> 10:16.449
And so, when I first went in,
I was just amazed with all these jackets.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.867
<i>There's so much detail.</i>

10:17.950 --> 10:20.328
<i>I don't think you'll ever see it,</i>
<i>but there's a bunch of poetry</i>

10:20.411 --> 10:24.373
<i>and just the way the star is designed</i>
<i>on the back of the jacket.</i>

10:24.457 --> 10:29.253
I had, like, 100 other versions
of Mexican sort of folkloric art

10:29.337 --> 10:32.923
and Day of the Dead references
that could be part of the kind of emblem

10:33.007 --> 10:34.342
on the back of the jacket.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.636
<i>But I'm really happy</i>
<i>that we went with the star.</i>

10:36.719 --> 10:38.679
In the street scenes
that we've shot with her running,

10:38.763 --> 10:40.848
<i>you see this white star</i>
<i>going down the street,</i>

10:40.931 --> 10:43.476
and it's a really good focus point.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.771
It was fantastic working with Xochitl.

10:46.854 --> 10:51.400
<i>I think she's probably gotta be</i>
<i>one of the youngest actors in the MCU</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:56.614
and it can be quite scary, you know.
I mean, it was scary for me to enter into,

10:56.697 --> 11:00.076
and then someone so young
with so much on her shoulders.

11:01.285 --> 11:06.499
One of our moves is collecting the power
and knowing that I have it.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.798
It's a huge responsibility to originate
a character, a superhero.

11:13.881 --> 11:17.885
It's crazy, it's really like,
"Oh, my goodness."

11:18.511 --> 11:21.806
It's good to kind of lift off the pressure
with that.

11:22.181 --> 11:27.436
We always have a bit of music on set,
and she's big into, what is it, TikTok?

11:28.020 --> 11:31.774
She tried to teach me some moves,
but I think I pulled a muscle.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.152
(LAUGHS)

11:36.112 --> 11:39.490
Benedict Wong, I mean, he is amazing.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.910
He carries this mega-huge, like,
boom speaker

11:42.993 --> 11:45.830
<i>and he just carries it around</i>
<i>and just, like, bumps up and down.</i>

11:45.913 --> 11:48.666
He's like a walking rave party,
it's amazing.

11:48.749 --> 11:53.379
He's got some snazzy moves,
but I think my moves are a bit snazzier.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.463
He's catching on.

11:56.132 --> 12:01.178
America Chavez, it was such a pleasure
for me to get to work on this character.

12:01.262 --> 12:04.390
She's just a badass. It's something
that we've established is that

12:05.141 --> 12:10.229
it's impossible, near impossible to travel
from one universe to another.

12:10.479 --> 12:15.192
In <i>Loki,</i> you can kind of hop
from one timeline branch to another,

12:15.276 --> 12:18.279
<i>but you've gotta be anchored</i>
<i>to some original timeline.</i>

12:18.612 --> 12:21.741
What America can do is, she can jump

12:22.199 --> 12:26.704
<i>from one universe to another one.</i>
<i>She can literally do the impossible.</i>

12:26.787 --> 12:32.835
She doesn't know how to control her power,
but every time she's triggered by fear,

12:32.918 --> 12:34.962
<i>a portal opens into another universe.</i>

12:35.546 --> 12:37.173
LEFLER: <i>Working with America Chavez,</i>

12:37.256 --> 12:39.925
we had many different introductions
to her as a character,

12:40.009 --> 12:46.182
but I think I storyboarded all of them
so I got to work with her character a lot.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.227
<i>What was so fascinating</i>
<i>about America Chavez to me</i>

12:50.311 --> 12:56.025
was just her sense of loneliness
that she didn't have a family,

12:56.650 --> 13:01.030
she didn't have friends,
she didn't even have a reality.

13:02.156 --> 13:04.408
So, she finds herself bouncing
between worlds,

13:04.867 --> 13:09.914
really being lost amongst the Multiverse,
and learning how to survive herself

13:09.997 --> 13:12.082
<i>until an entity starts hunting her.</i>

13:12.875 --> 13:16.337
<i>And that's when Doctor Strange and Wong</i>
<i>realize the stakes of this movie.</i>

13:16.712 --> 13:22.551
It's an incredible power but represents
a grave danger for the world of the MCU.

13:22.635 --> 13:25.596
DOCTOR STRANGE: The power is
dangerous enough in the hands of a kid...

13:25.679 --> 13:27.598
imagine if a real threat acquired it?

13:30.309 --> 13:31.393
RAIMI: Ready,

13:31.811 --> 13:33.437
and action.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.607
ELIZABETH OLSEN: <i>When we were about</i>
<i>to go back to finishing</i> WandaVision,

13:36.690 --> 13:40.027
I was pitched the actual story
of <i>Doctor Strange,</i>

13:40.110 --> 13:43.781
and I was shocked.

13:43.948 --> 13:48.577
No one told me that their plan for me
was to be the villain. (LAUGHS)

13:49.745 --> 13:53.082
We knew that we wanted Wanda to be in it.

13:53.207 --> 13:57.920
<i>I think, originally, there's a version</i>
<i>where Wanda was maybe gonna turn bad</i>

13:58.003 --> 13:59.088
<i>at the end.</i>

13:59.171 --> 14:01.423
<i>That was a big change that I made</i>

14:01.507 --> 14:05.803
<i>and I had a strong perspective on</i>
<i>making her a villain from the get-go.</i>

14:05.886 --> 14:09.139
<i>It was always like, "Well, that'll happen</i>
<i>in an</i> Avengers <i>movie or something."</i>

14:09.557 --> 14:11.058
My perspective was,

14:11.141 --> 14:15.688
"Why are we letting some other movie
get the best villain ever?"

14:17.314 --> 14:20.276
It was an exciting opportunity
because it's really fun

14:20.359 --> 14:23.904
playing people with moral ambiguity.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.197
WANDA: Her sacrifice...

14:26.198 --> 14:27.449
would be for the greater good.

14:27.533 --> 14:32.538
OLSEN: <i>She is one of the most powerful</i>
<i>beings that's ever existed.</i>

14:32.621 --> 14:34.874
I was meant to rule everything.

14:34.957 --> 14:39.920
Why does that mean that she now
has to settle for just being good,

14:40.004 --> 14:43.424
when all she wants is something that seems
so simple and small

14:43.507 --> 14:44.717
<i>which is to be with her kids?</i>

14:46.302 --> 14:48.679
We've seen the tragedy of her life.

14:48.762 --> 14:54.935
<i>She killed Vision, only to have Thanos</i>
<i>rewind those events with the Time Stone,</i>

14:55.019 --> 14:59.398
<i>the Time Stone he got from Doctor Strange,</i>
<i>so that Wanda's sacrifice was for nothing.</i>

14:59.481 --> 15:02.568
<i>She's given up a lot</i>
<i>and from her perspective,</i>

15:02.651 --> 15:05.696
<i>all she wants is one life,</i>
<i>she wants America Chavez,</i>

15:05.779 --> 15:10.200
she wants to take her power, which, yes,
will kill America,

15:10.284 --> 15:12.912
but to Wanda, she's earned that sacrifice.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.918
Alex Byrne's costume in <i>Ultron</i>
was Wanda's first outing.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.587
<i>So, she started out</i>
<i>in store-bought street clothes</i>

15:21.670 --> 15:24.048
<i>with the torn jeans,</i>
<i>with the cropped jacket.</i>

15:24.131 --> 15:26.050
<i>And then, by the time she gets</i>
<i>to</i> Infinity War,

15:26.133 --> 15:30.220
<i>she's wearing that red body coat,</i>
<i>so leaning more towards the comics.</i>

15:30.512 --> 15:34.516
<i>The whole</i> WandaVision <i>look,</i>
<i>when she transforms into Scarlet Witch,</i>

15:34.600 --> 15:37.978
<i>she's been, for some time,</i>
<i>in possession of the</i> Darkhold.

15:38.062 --> 15:43.067
And such a powerful tome can have
a sort of devastating effect on a person,

15:43.150 --> 15:47.029
if they try and use its powers,
so it has its downside.

15:47.112 --> 15:52.117
<i>You get this sort of Multiversal mold</i>
<i>and contamination growing over your body,</i>

15:52.201 --> 15:56.288
<i>your costume, as you're overtaken</i>
<i>by the sort of evil powers within it.</i>

15:56.372 --> 15:59.667
<i>I wanted, if this evil kind of thing</i>
<i>was growing over your body...</i>

15:59.750 --> 16:03.003
<i>Her shoulders were covered,</i>
<i>and the armor is now...</i>

16:03.087 --> 16:08.133
The detail on the corset, on the bodice,
is now really kind of deteriorated,

16:08.217 --> 16:10.427
<i>and the skirt is really fluid now.</i>

16:10.511 --> 16:13.597
<i>The crown too has a...</i>
<i>It's like it was a sort of jewel,</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:17.977
but now, it's sort of pitted and has
patina and devastation to it as well,

16:18.060 --> 16:20.938
so it's a lot more eroded and worn
than in <i>WandaVision.</i>

16:21.021 --> 16:22.898
And so, those were the changes I made

16:22.982 --> 16:27.152
because it fitted within the idea
that something had happened to her

16:27.236 --> 16:31.365
<i>in possession of the</i> Darkhold
<i>that created this sort of distortion</i>

16:31.448 --> 16:33.867
<i>and deterioration of her costume.</i>

16:33.951 --> 16:36.495
WANDA: <i>Every night, the same dream.</i>

16:37.579 --> 16:39.748
<i>And every morning...</i>

16:41.375 --> 16:44.128
the same nightmare.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.382
We really wanted to have the audience
identify with the villain of the piece,

16:48.465 --> 16:52.177
really understand her, not make them
a brouhahaha villain,

16:52.261 --> 16:56.098
but somebody who you really loved
and could relate to.

16:56.181 --> 16:58.142
WANDA: You break the rules
and become a hero.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.519
I do it, and I become the enemy.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.105
That doesn't seem fair.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.566
RAIMI: That was so beautiful.
Cut, that was great.

17:06.775 --> 17:09.236
That was a constant thing
for Sam Raimi and I.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.781
<i>I've had so much fun</i>
<i>playing off of his ideas,</i>

17:12.865 --> 17:17.786
and I think he and I really relish
in this character

17:18.120 --> 17:21.790
and we've been enjoying
how delicious it is

17:21.874 --> 17:24.543
to justify some of the things
she does in the movie.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.420
RAIMI: I loved it.
There's a little bit of dread

17:26.503 --> 17:27.963
of what would happen if she were called.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.674

RACHEL MCADAMS: <i>That's just</i>
<i>one of the things Marvel does so well</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:42.436
<i>and better than anyone,</i>

17:42.519 --> 17:44.938
<i>is that their villains, you know,</i>
<i>you find yourself</i>

17:45.022 --> 17:48.692
siding with them at times, you're like,
"Wait, I feel bad for you,"

17:48.776 --> 17:52.654
or, "Well, they have a really good point,
you know, Thanos has a...

17:52.738 --> 17:53.989
"He has a really good point."

17:54.073 --> 17:58.285
So I feel like they've built that
with Wanda so well,

17:58.368 --> 18:01.872
where you just feel for her
and her struggle.

18:02.831 --> 18:06.627
It's just a very filled-out character
that, I think, makes you feel

18:06.710 --> 18:09.755
a lot of complicated things.
Those are always the best villains.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.176
RAIMI: <i>She's a villain</i>
<i>because she believes</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:15.260
<i>the end justifies the means.</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:18.097
She'll simply do anything
to be with the ones she loves.

18:18.180 --> 18:21.058
<i>She just loved too much, was her problem.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:24.061
<i>But once you start</i>
<i>taking the bad path in life,</i>

18:24.144 --> 18:26.855
<i>you make one bad choice and another,</i>
<i>it seems like,</i>

18:26.939 --> 18:28.190
sometimes, there's no way back.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.321
-That's great, I think we got it.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.247
Yeah.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.332
It doesn't quite work out
how they hoped it would.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.585
And arm the students.
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.883
I'm Sam, the Director, and all of you
are students at Kamar-Taj.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.469

19:21.368 --> 19:23.036
-(GRUNTS)
-Defensive positions!

19:23.287 --> 19:25.080
We have a particularly big sequence

19:25.164 --> 19:27.833
where Wanda,
she's coming to attack Kamar-Taj.

19:27.916 --> 19:28.917
(GRUNTS)

19:30.377 --> 19:33.589
The Kamar-Taj battle,
in terms of shot count, it's huge.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.757
<i>That scene was shot</i>
<i>on three different stages.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:38.051
<i>We're here on the Sirius stage,</i>
<i>as I understand it,</i>

19:38.135 --> 19:40.345
they lift these stages up
for big concerts.

19:40.429 --> 19:42.723
<i>So, we lifted the stage up,</i>
<i>it's quite a massive stage,</i>

19:42.806 --> 19:44.975
<i>but not big enough for our Kamar-Taj.</i>

19:47.144 --> 19:50.772
Even though we only have one rooftop,
it has to play as three different rooftops

19:50.856 --> 19:53.483
on Kamar-Taj
that are all oriented differently.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.445
<i>And so, one of the tricks is</i>
<i>not only figuring out, on any given day,</i>

19:56.528 --> 19:59.031
<i>who's supposed to be on that rooftop</i>
<i>and how it's dressed</i>

19:59.114 --> 20:02.284
<i>and what sort of damage is there,</i>
<i>but also where the lighting comes from.</i>

20:02.367 --> 20:04.995
Wanda is flying around so she starts off
on the approach

20:05.078 --> 20:08.707
<i>and there's a little bit of a stand-off.</i>
<i>After that, Wanda starts doing attacks</i>

20:08.790 --> 20:11.585
<i>and she starts to fly all the way around</i>
<i>looking for weak points</i>

20:11.668 --> 20:14.004
<i>inside this collective force field.</i>

20:14.087 --> 20:17.174
We call this the strafing run,
it's kinda like what you'd picture

20:17.257 --> 20:19.801
if you were in a jet fighter
that's coming around banking

20:19.885 --> 20:23.305
and just boom, boom, boom.
Stuff flying and in your face.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.853
TUCKER: <i>Charlie did all of the design</i>
<i>for Kamar-Taj.</i>

20:29.937 --> 20:33.565
<i>That 3D model was then handed off</i>
<i>to proof the previz company</i>

20:33.649 --> 20:35.734
<i>that prevized the Kamar Taj sequence.</i>

20:35.817 --> 20:38.862
Then, to help us visualize that,
that previz model gets put into

20:38.946 --> 20:42.991
<i>an iPad and that allows us to sort of</i>
<i>temporarily position ourselves on set.</i>

20:43.075 --> 20:45.160
LEWIS: <i>I've seen it</i>
<i>in the past five years develop</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:49.331
from this big virtual camera, whole crew,
whole expensive setup that takes days

20:49.414 --> 20:51.124
and weeks to do,
whereas now it's on an iPad

20:51.208 --> 20:52.793
<i>and it's in your back pocket, essentially.</i>

20:52.876 --> 20:55.337
<i>Any characters or props,</i>
<i>we can bring in with animation</i>

20:55.420 --> 20:58.298
<i>and virtually see where it is</i>
<i>so it's a great tool on set</i>

20:58.382 --> 21:01.426
<i>when we need to look up and see a monster</i>
<i>or an explosion.</i>

21:01.510 --> 21:04.429
One of the other things we have to really
plan for is, is special effects.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.556
<i>A lot of planning</i>
<i>going into, from the previz,</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:10.394
<i>where certain explosions will happen</i>
<i>inside the floors of Kamar-Taj.</i>

21:10.477 --> 21:12.562
MAN: Three, two, one, action!

21:13.897 --> 21:17.901
So, we're setting up
25 different explosions, some fireballs,

21:17.985 --> 21:21.321
<i>some ground hits, where the ground</i>
<i>is erupting, total mayhem.</i>

21:24.908 --> 21:27.995
<i>This particular sequence</i>
<i>was a great collaboration</i>

21:28.078 --> 21:30.914
<i>between special effects, stunts,</i>
<i>camera crews.</i>

21:30.998 --> 21:34.668
<i>The whole second unit has worked</i>
<i>miraculously to all mesh together</i>

21:34.751 --> 21:36.586
and create a wonderful little sequence.

21:36.670 --> 21:40.090
I think that was our biggest
action sequence of the film.

21:41.174 --> 21:43.969
<i>There were some shots that were</i>
<i>extremely choreographed,</i>

21:44.052 --> 21:47.264
I mean, we had camera winches,
and we had R ratchets

21:47.347 --> 21:48.640
<i>that blow people back.</i>

21:48.724 --> 21:52.477
We did somewhere between
40 and 50 different ratchets.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.563
Those are the explosions
when cannons blow up,

21:54.646 --> 21:57.024
<i>we ratcheted six people back there,</i>
<i>when she lands,</i>

21:57.107 --> 22:00.319
that had six or seven people on it,
but it was a lot of fun to develop.

22:00.402 --> 22:03.822
We actually, kind of, started the idea
by putting one of our stunt guys

22:03.905 --> 22:07.492
<i>in the winch holding a DSLR camera.</i>
<i>And then we did all the action,</i>

22:07.576 --> 22:09.786
<i>kind of buzzed him through</i>
<i>as if he were the camera.</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:13.707
That's sort of our poor man's version
of the motion-based winch camera.

22:14.249 --> 22:17.210
JEFF: <i>So, we've got a camera</i>
<i>on a wire, a 3D winch system</i>

22:17.294 --> 22:19.546
that basically is the Scarlet Witch's
point of view

22:19.629 --> 22:21.631
<i>and it comes around behind the building.</i>

22:21.715 --> 22:24.301
You see the first explosion
go up right in front of it.

22:24.384 --> 22:27.721
<i>It comes through it, it comes around</i>
<i>and it just sees all of this,</i>

22:27.804 --> 22:31.725
<i>chasing it all and then we got four more</i>
<i>cameras in various positions to catch</i>

22:31.808 --> 22:35.979
<i>Rintrah's run, catch the bell falling,</i>
<i>catch individual people flying</i>

22:36.063 --> 22:37.981
<i>and hitting the ground</i>
<i>and coming right at ya.</i>

22:38.065 --> 22:39.608
CORBOULD: <i>The explosions, we really wanted</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:41.651
<i>to get the stunt people</i>
<i>right on top of them.</i>

22:41.735 --> 22:45.155
<i>Rather than use traditional black powder,</i>
<i>we've gone for a high pressure nitrogen</i>

22:45.238 --> 22:48.033
which is really, really safe,
you can almost stand right next to it,

22:48.116 --> 22:49.326
but gives a wonderful effect.

22:49.409 --> 22:50.577
MAN: Action!

22:52.913 --> 22:55.040
SAVANI: <i>So we've just done</i>
<i>the first explosion</i>

22:55.123 --> 22:56.833
<i>and I'm the first one that sort of goes up</i>

22:56.917 --> 22:59.086
into the air.
Obviously, it's a bit nerve-wracking

22:59.169 --> 23:00.796
'cause you don't know exactly
what'll happen.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.799
<i>We've rehearsed a lot of it before</i>
<i>but with the SFX and stuff,</i>

23:03.882 --> 23:06.051
<i>it's the first time, with full costume,</i>
<i>it's the first time.</i>

23:06.134 --> 23:09.388
JEFF: <i>I think everyone was</i>
<i>a bit surprised how big it was on the day,</i>

23:09.471 --> 23:13.100
<i>which kinda helps their acting</i>
<i>'cause it turns from acting to, like,</i>

23:13.183 --> 23:14.559
"This is really happening."

23:14.643 --> 23:19.022
<i>We actually had a little too much dust</i>
<i>so you lost 'em and you couldn't see 'em,</i>

23:19.106 --> 23:22.484
but it looked really cool in that dust
so we're gonna lower the dust a little bit

23:22.567 --> 23:24.319
<i>and hopefully we'll see</i>
<i>a bit more of that.</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:26.405
I saw some of the playback.
Really pleased with it.

23:26.488 --> 23:29.866
So, yeah, we just take our time,
don't rush and pick every camera position

23:29.950 --> 23:32.786
to get the most out of
what all the stunt players are doing

23:32.869 --> 23:35.163
<i>and the special effects explosions</i>
<i>are doing.</i>

23:35.705 --> 23:38.583
CORBOULD: <i>We've been testing this</i>
<i>for probably four months now,</i>

23:38.667 --> 23:41.211
<i>to reach this point.</i>
<i>But it's great when it all comes together.</i>

23:41.294 --> 23:43.422
<i>Unfortunately, it's all over</i>
<i>in about 20 seconds,</i>

23:43.505 --> 23:45.465
<i>but it'll be great on the screen.</i>

23:50.178 --> 23:53.390
That sequence was what
every stunt coordinator looks forward to,

23:53.473 --> 23:56.017
to be honest with you. You get to hire
a lot of stunt performers

23:56.101 --> 23:58.395
<i>that are really talented</i>
<i>and you get to show off their talents</i>

23:58.478 --> 24:00.105
<i>and you get to blow stuff up.</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.817
<i>This is an extremely wire-intense film.</i>

24:03.900 --> 24:07.446
<i>So, we've got two separate rigging teams</i>
<i>that are working on different sequences,</i>

24:07.529 --> 24:11.450
<i>pretty much full-time. I've been a part of</i>
<i>five other Marvel films before this</i>

24:11.533 --> 24:13.952
<i>and this is the most wire-intensive one</i>
<i>I've been a part of.</i>

24:14.035 --> 24:17.038
MAN: Three, two, one, action!

24:17.122 --> 24:22.210
COUNTS: <i>The audience and the actors and</i>
<i>the studio really like to see the actors</i>

24:22.294 --> 24:24.963
doing their own stunts,
so, we facilitate that.

24:25.046 --> 24:28.508
<i>We had Strange fly in, around this corner,</i>
<i>starting at about 30 feet</i>

24:28.592 --> 24:32.345
and he probably flew about 80 feet
down around the street and we land him

24:32.429 --> 24:34.055
in the middle of the street
and then action.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.892
<i>The whole point was to show him,</i>
<i>a really small figure,</i>

24:36.975 --> 24:40.937
<i>and to land right in front of camera,</i>
<i>a foot-and-a-half away from it, on a cue.</i>

24:41.021 --> 24:43.273
<i>So, they're computerized</i>
<i>and they're all rehearsed</i>

24:43.356 --> 24:44.441
<i>and that allows us</i>

24:44.524 --> 24:47.861
<i>to get selfish and use Benedict's face</i>
<i>as much as we can.</i>

24:47.944 --> 24:49.154
MAN: And rolling!

24:49.446 --> 24:51.031
So much happens so quickly.

24:54.576 --> 24:58.330
So, I just got off the wires and I'm not
gonna lie, they're really scary.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.707
COUNTS: <i>Xochitl's been great.</i>
<i>She's got a great work ethic.</i>

25:00.790 --> 25:04.085
<i>She really wants to rehearse</i>
<i>and do lots of her own stunts.</i>

25:04.169 --> 25:07.797
Unfortunately, she is a minor.
So, we can only allow her to go so far.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.466
<i>I think she's had a blast on this.</i>

25:09.549 --> 25:11.718
We've actually had her in the winches
and stuff like that.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.929
We've moved her around,
we've dropped her on things.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.515
I don't know how to describe it.
It's like, the second you go down,

25:16.598 --> 25:19.893
<i>it's like every gut feeling</i>
<i>just disappears and it's like,</i>

25:19.976 --> 25:21.019
"Where'd everything go?"

25:21.102 --> 25:22.187
MAN: Go!

25:23.230 --> 25:25.607
It's been a lot of fun.
And I've got two daughters at home,

25:25.690 --> 25:28.485
they're not quite as old as she is,
but it is a lot of fun

25:28.568 --> 25:30.529
<i>to sit and watch someone</i>
<i>who's in their mid-teens</i>

25:30.612 --> 25:33.615
<i>develop a character and get to be</i>
<i>a part of the Marvel universe</i>

25:33.698 --> 25:34.783
<i>at such a young age.</i>

25:37.619 --> 25:40.539
OLSEN: <i>For some reason,</i>
<i>I'm okay being in a harness.</i>

25:40.622 --> 25:42.207
<i>It's fine to fly around</i>

25:42.290 --> 25:45.669
and be in it for a certain period of time
and I really do enjoy it a lot

25:45.752 --> 25:49.923
<i>and with these things called tuning forks.</i>
<i>So, I'm not just being held up on wires,</i>

25:50.006 --> 25:53.760
<i>but I actually have a harness on with</i>
<i>a big piece of metal that hugs my waist.</i>

25:53.843 --> 25:55.554
<i>I have found that to be really helpful</i>

25:55.637 --> 25:58.056
<i>because you have more control</i>
<i>over your body</i>

25:58.139 --> 26:02.227
<i>and so we've done a variation</i>
<i>of these tuning forks and wire work.</i>

26:02.477 --> 26:04.437
COUNTS: <i>The great thing</i>
<i>about Lizzie is that</i>

26:04.521 --> 26:06.106
<i>she's played this character for a while.</i>

26:06.189 --> 26:07.399
MAN: Action!

26:08.024 --> 26:10.402
COUNTS: <i>She really knows the character</i>
<i>inside and out.</i>

26:12.404 --> 26:13.446
<i>Scarlet Witch is supposedly</i>

26:13.530 --> 26:15.907
<i>one of the most powerful</i>
<i>Marvel characters out there.</i>

26:15.991 --> 26:19.077
The difference is, she uses her magic.
So, when we do these fights,

26:19.160 --> 26:22.455
you'll notice that she very rarely gets
touched or touches anybody else.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.749
<i>Everything is done with magic,</i>
<i>so, it is a fight,</i>

26:24.833 --> 26:27.335
<i>but we don't actually physically hit her</i>
<i>with stuff.</i>

26:28.169 --> 26:31.089
YANG: <i>This is the first time I'm working</i>
<i>with the Wanda character.</i>

26:31.840 --> 26:35.010
I did study a lot, online,
with her movements.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.679
<i>But first time I met her,</i>
<i>was see her do her movement.</i>

26:37.762 --> 26:40.056
I went like, "Wow! She's Wanda."

26:40.140 --> 26:42.976
COUNTS: <i>She's done an amazing job</i>
<i>with helping us build the action.</i>

26:43.059 --> 26:45.520
<i>So, it'll kinda culminate</i>
<i>in this Illuminati fight</i>

26:45.604 --> 26:46.813
<i>you'll see with the superheroes.</i>

26:46.896 --> 26:48.481
RAIMI: Cut!
MAN: Yeah, can we cut?

26:48.565 --> 26:51.484
RAIMI: That was good.
I think we got the master we need.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.572
Secret societies.

26:56.656 --> 26:57.991
Don't think they're real?

26:58.575 --> 26:59.743
Well, think again, pal.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.288
Ever heard of the Freemasons,
or the Knights Templar?

27:03.747 --> 27:05.582
<i>How about the Ten Rings, or HYDRA?</i>

27:05.999 --> 27:09.127
Maybe those last two things aren't real,
but I know you've heard of 'em,

27:09.210 --> 27:11.296
<i>'cause you're wearing</i>
<i>Captain America underpants.</i>

27:12.005 --> 27:14.132
The point is, I'm willing to roll
with the idea

27:14.215 --> 27:17.218
of some clandestine organization
running the whole show

27:17.302 --> 27:19.471
from behind the proverbial curtain.

27:19.554 --> 27:24.100
Just don't tell me that those folks are
ridin' around in yellow hoverchairs

27:24.184 --> 27:29.064
and throwing Vibranium frisbees painted
like Union Jacks. (LAUGHS)

27:29.147 --> 27:30.482
Don't tell me that.

27:40.742 --> 27:43.912
The Illuminati's been a group we've wanted
to introduce in our movies for years.

27:44.537 --> 27:45.580
BARON: Stephen Strange,

27:46.456 --> 27:48.708
you are now called
before the Illuminati.

27:49.250 --> 27:50.293
The Illumi-what-y?

27:51.252 --> 27:54.798
Doctor Strange and America Chavez
find themself in another version

27:54.881 --> 27:57.133
<i>of our reality</i>
<i>where there is an Illuminati.</i>

27:57.217 --> 27:59.803
PALMER: <i>They're a secret organization</i>
<i>that works off-the-grid.</i>

27:59.886 --> 28:02.514
They do the things that the other groups
like the Avengers

28:02.597 --> 28:03.890
<i>wouldn't be too happy about.</i>

28:03.973 --> 28:06.726
Your alternate self
created the Illuminati

28:06.810 --> 28:09.104
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

28:09.187 --> 28:12.315
PALMER: <i>To do it in an alternate universe</i>
<i>in the Multiverse,</i>

28:12.399 --> 28:13.692
<i>was a really exciting thing</i>

28:13.775 --> 28:17.904
<i>because we get to meet a version</i>
<i>of this group in this other universe,</i>

28:18.029 --> 28:22.075
and then we still might get to see
an Illuminati of our main MCU one day,

28:22.158 --> 28:23.410
which is also very exciting.

28:23.493 --> 28:26.246
Yeah, that's definitely a case of me
just not knowing

28:26.329 --> 28:28.415
what to do with the script and thinking...

28:28.498 --> 28:29.582
Crap.

28:29.666 --> 28:32.585
"We're in the second act.
Something's gotta happen.

28:32.669 --> 28:34.295
"What should it be?"

28:34.379 --> 28:37.882
<i>It comes at a point where it's like,</i>
<i>"We're a little past halfway.</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:41.386
<i>"Let's break the movie</i>
<i>and do something really nuts."</i>

28:42.887 --> 28:44.848
RAIMI: <i>When Marvel first wrote</i>
<i>about the Illuminati,</i>

28:44.931 --> 28:46.307
they had their characters.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.559
Doctor Doom was among them,

28:47.642 --> 28:49.644
<i>Doctor Strange,</i>
<i>plenty of different characters.</i>

28:49.728 --> 28:51.438
But we had to make a selection.

28:51.521 --> 28:54.649
WALDRON: <i>Who's the most exciting</i>
<i>cast of characters?</i>

28:54.733 --> 28:56.985
<i>Do we just pick who we want</i>
<i>from the comics?</i>

28:57.068 --> 28:58.903
<i>Obviously,</i>
<i>there's different rights' issues,</i>

28:58.987 --> 29:00.572
<i>folks showin' up in other movies.</i>

29:00.655 --> 29:03.825
RAIMI: <i>So, we did take into account</i>
<i>what the fans wanted to see.</i>

29:03.908 --> 29:07.328
We wanted the fans to go, "Oh, how cool!"
I mean, that really was our goal.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.122
<i>We wanted to give the fans</i>
<i>what they wanted.</i>

29:09.205 --> 29:11.124
<i>Just not exactly what they expected.</i>

29:11.207 --> 29:14.335
The Illuminati you meet in this movie
is made up of Mordo...

29:14.419 --> 29:18.256
It is very much a different character,
but with the same, or a similar essence.

29:18.673 --> 29:20.008
I'm sorry, Stephen.

29:20.467 --> 29:22.343
EJIOFOR: <i>From the beginning</i>
<i>of the first film,</i>

29:22.427 --> 29:23.928
this was what the build was.

29:24.012 --> 29:26.890
<i>Strange and Mordo are, at some point,</i>
<i>really gonna get into it.</i>

29:26.973 --> 29:29.726
The bill comes due.

29:30.518 --> 29:31.519
Always.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.898
EJIOFOR: <i>Mordo is somebody</i>
<i>who took Strange under his wing.</i>

29:34.981 --> 29:37.692
<i>And somehow, part of that</i>
<i>is also echoed in the fight,</i>

29:37.776 --> 29:39.444
<i>even though it's in a different universe.</i>

29:39.527 --> 29:42.280
<i>It's still the teacher</i>
<i>and student dynamic.</i>

29:42.614 --> 29:45.074
<i>They're not able to use their magic.</i>

29:45.158 --> 29:48.077
<i>So, now we're seeing</i>
<i>the Mordo-Strange fight,</i>

29:48.161 --> 29:49.954
but as a street brawl.

29:50.038 --> 29:53.291
<i>It's a great way of expressing character</i>
<i>through physicality.</i>

29:53.374 --> 29:56.920
<i>So, I'm always keen to do it,</i>
<i>as much as I can, to do it myself.</i>

29:57.003 --> 30:00.381
And that is also fun, you know?
I mean, lest we forget.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.008
It's also enjoyable to do.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.970
WALDRON: <i>Alternate Peggy Carter...</i>

30:06.054 --> 30:07.096
Captain Carter.

30:07.180 --> 30:09.182
...that got the serum, that's awesome.

30:09.265 --> 30:12.519
<i>Hayley Atwell is obviously somebody</i>
<i>that the fans love.</i>

30:12.602 --> 30:15.188
Great. I loved every bit of that. Badass.

30:15.438 --> 30:17.315
That's what the kids want to see. Cut.

30:17.398 --> 30:20.318
As I understand it, the whole thing
came out of the <i>What If...?</i> animation.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.279
<i>So, she became the super-soldier.</i>

30:23.571 --> 30:27.492
<i>We took references,</i>
<i>so</i> First Avenger <i>and then</i> Ultron,

30:27.575 --> 30:29.077
<i>along with Ryan's illustration,</i>

30:29.160 --> 30:32.247
<i>which captures</i>
<i>the</i> What if...? <i>vintage feel.</i>

30:32.330 --> 30:36.584
<i>And we've used the same fabric</i>
<i>as we used on the</i> Age of Ultron

30:36.668 --> 30:40.630
<i>Captain America costume.</i>
<i>So, it's not like a skin-fitting suit.</i>

30:40.713 --> 30:44.509
<i>It's very much like Captain America,</i>
<i>a combat suit.</i>

30:44.592 --> 30:46.803
<i>Hayley's really happy</i>
<i>with the whole structure</i>

30:46.886 --> 30:48.471
<i>and fit and silhouette of it.</i>

30:48.555 --> 30:51.975
We kept Peggy in the Captain America
sense-of-fighting-style.

30:52.058 --> 30:53.393
(GRUNTING)

30:54.269 --> 30:57.230
That was a fun sequence to do
because we got to use the shield

30:57.313 --> 30:59.691
and it is a little more practical
hand-to-hand fighting.

31:01.943 --> 31:02.944
Haven't you had enough?

31:03.027 --> 31:04.153
(SPITS)

31:04.237 --> 31:05.572
Oh, I could do this all day.

31:05.655 --> 31:07.907
Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

31:07.991 --> 31:12.120
Maria Rambeau, who really stole the show
in <i>Captain Marvel...</i>

31:12.203 --> 31:13.496
Call me "young lady" again,

31:13.580 --> 31:15.790
I'm gonna put my foot
in a place it's not supposed to be.

31:15.874 --> 31:19.460
WALDRON: <i>To see her put on</i>
<i>the suit and kick ass is so cool.</i>

31:19.544 --> 31:21.546
Get the hell out
of my universe!

31:21.629 --> 31:24.215
WALDRON: <i>And Lashana brings</i>
<i>so much to that character.</i>

31:24.299 --> 31:28.511
CHURCHYARD: <i>Maria Rambeau switching</i>
<i>into the Carol Danvers costume,</i>

31:28.595 --> 31:29.888
<i>it's black and silver.</i>

31:29.971 --> 31:34.309
<i>It holds onto all the same design elements</i>
<i>of Brie Larson's costume.</i>

31:34.392 --> 31:37.270
<i>But we've transposed it</i>
<i>into metallic-silver,</i>

31:37.353 --> 31:40.773
kind of gun-metal color and black.
It looks really amazing.

31:41.357 --> 31:43.860
That was great. That's awesome.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.070
WALDRON: <i>And then the big surprise...</i>

31:46.154 --> 31:49.532
BARON: Our final member,
Professor Charles Xavier.

31:50.408 --> 31:54.454
It was just an honor for me to get to sit
and type dialogue for him

31:54.537 --> 31:57.290
<i>and to introduce him</i>
<i>into the world of the MCU.</i>

31:58.291 --> 32:01.169
<i>Everybody making comic-book movies</i>
<i>owes him a great debt.</i>

32:02.962 --> 32:04.589
Movin' on, beautifully done.

32:04.839 --> 32:07.258
Thank you, Sir Patrick,
for that great concentration.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.052
OCHS: <i>On this film,</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:12.263
<i>I think our biggest challenge</i>
<i>was working in a global pandemic.</i>

32:13.848 --> 32:16.100
<i>Really, it's a scheduling issue.</i>

32:16.267 --> 32:18.102
<i>For instance, Wanda's orchard...</i>

32:18.186 --> 32:20.271
RAIMI: Here we go. Roll camera.

32:20.355 --> 32:24.025
It was a really important scene
for Sam from the very beginning.

32:24.525 --> 32:27.487
<i>He wanted her to be</i>
<i>in this beautiful apple orchard</i>

32:27.570 --> 32:30.114
<i>and we were gonna</i>
<i>shoot the movie pre-COVID.</i>

32:30.198 --> 32:31.491
<i>It was gonna work out perfect</i>

32:31.574 --> 32:33.576
<i>because we were gonna be</i>
<i>here for the apple blossoms.</i>

32:33.660 --> 32:35.244
<i>Then our schedule shifted.</i>

32:35.328 --> 32:39.123
<i>And because there's been a cold spell</i>
<i>in England, the blossoms haven't come yet.</i>

32:39.207 --> 32:40.375
We were like, "What do we do?

32:40.458 --> 32:44.295
"Do we film them on a green screen?
Do we do an entirely CG orchard later?

32:44.379 --> 32:47.757
<i>"Or do we go out to the orchard</i>
<i>and do we put CG blossoms on it?"</i>

32:47.840 --> 32:51.594
Charlie Wood, our production designer
sent an army of people out there

32:51.678 --> 32:57.308
<i>and tied little wire blossoms</i>
<i>onto about six trees and then</i>

32:57.392 --> 33:00.645
<i>they added another so many thousand pounds</i>
<i>and then they got eight trees</i>

33:00.728 --> 33:05.191
and then ten trees and we went out there
and they've shot this beautiful scene now

33:05.274 --> 33:10.863
<i>and no visual effects and you can't tell</i>
<i>that these are fabricated blossoms</i>

33:10.947 --> 33:13.658
<i>that have been tied on</i>
<i>to these trees by hand.</i>

33:14.909 --> 33:17.704
Sometimes, people may get the impression
that these films are

33:17.787 --> 33:19.455
almost entirely virtual, they're not.

33:19.956 --> 33:24.002
<i>We have hundreds of people</i>
<i>working on these sets and it takes us</i>

33:24.085 --> 33:25.086
<i>many, many months to build them.</i>

33:25.169 --> 33:26.879
<i>There's nothing better</i>
<i>than the real thing</i>

33:26.963 --> 33:29.799
<i>for an actor to be able to understand</i>
<i>the environment they're in,</i>

33:29.882 --> 33:32.468
for a director to be able to direct
a scene and to understand

33:32.552 --> 33:34.846
where everything is, and how it is.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.683
<i>That's incredibly important</i>
<i>as it is for the camera man.</i>

33:38.766 --> 33:40.184
Am I going on action?

33:40.268 --> 33:41.894
WOOD: <i>We try and build</i>
<i>as much as we can,</i>

33:42.311 --> 33:46.357
to a point at where it becomes impractical
or impossible.

33:46.441 --> 33:49.736
<i>So, if we're building this temple</i>
<i>in Kathmandu,</i>

33:49.819 --> 33:52.697
<i>we physically built all the interiors</i>
<i>they're walking around,</i>

33:52.780 --> 33:56.993
<i>whether it's corridors, or the interiors</i>
<i>of these temple rooms.</i>

33:57.076 --> 34:00.955
We would build those in their entirety,
360 degrees.

34:04.000 --> 34:09.881
You know the set where I am in the bio lab
and Doctor Strange and America

34:09.964 --> 34:12.967
are in these glass boxes,
and they're trapped in there.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.761
<i>And we couldn't even hear each other.</i>

34:14.844 --> 34:19.599
So, they gave me this weird earpiece
because I'm in this glass box.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.852
Here. And I can't hear anything at all.

34:22.935 --> 34:25.229
The sets are so elaborate and built out.

34:25.313 --> 34:28.483
Charlie's vision is to create
these wonderful sets,

34:28.566 --> 34:30.860
which have got incredible detail in them.

34:30.943 --> 34:34.614
WOOD: <i>We've got this great team</i>
<i>of plasterers and painters</i>

34:34.697 --> 34:38.159
<i>and mold-building</i>
<i>and there's all sorts of things we can do.</i>

34:38.242 --> 34:40.661
GIBBS: <i>You've got these stone structures,</i>
<i>you've got bronzes,</i>

34:40.745 --> 34:44.540
<i>you've got incredible carved timber.</i>
<i>So you go from the Kamar-Taj,</i>

34:44.624 --> 34:48.669
which is Nepalese
and then you've got the Sinister Sanctum,

34:48.753 --> 34:50.588
<i>it's this stunning mansion</i>
<i>on Bleecker Street.</i>

34:50.671 --> 34:51.756
<i>Then when we get to Wundagore,</i>

34:51.839 --> 34:56.010
<i>you've got an incredible stone temple</i>
<i>that's been produced.</i>

34:56.094 --> 34:57.887
This isn't a tomb.

34:57.970 --> 34:59.514
It's a throne.

34:59.597 --> 35:02.850
It was a tremendous challenge.
It took teams of really great artists.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.104
<i>That was a really exciting challenge</i>
<i>to take on.</i>

35:06.604 --> 35:09.982
Can I and these teams of artists
make the audience believe

35:10.066 --> 35:13.194
that they're taking a journey
through multiple universes?

35:14.487 --> 35:18.616
Right now, we're in New York City,
but we're not actually in New York.

35:18.699 --> 35:24.080
We're at Longcross Studios in England
in the UK and Marvel actually built this.

35:24.205 --> 35:27.125
The streets of New York,
I mean, look at how amazing it is.

35:27.208 --> 35:29.752
Everything lights up,
everything actually works.

35:29.836 --> 35:32.004
It was originally
gonna be shot in Cleveland.

35:32.088 --> 35:36.551
Cleveland has stood in for New York
for the Avengers movies once before.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.427
<i>And we were all set to go there.</i>

35:38.511 --> 35:41.472
PALMER: <i>And then, of course,</i>
<i>due to the COVID pandemic,</i>

35:41.556 --> 35:45.268
travelling to Cleveland seemed like
something we weren't gonna be able to do.

35:45.351 --> 35:49.689
<i>Our executive producer, Jamie Christopher,</i>
<i>who is a genius in movie-making</i>

35:49.772 --> 35:53.192
<i>and has been around for decades</i>
<i>in this business said,</i>

35:53.276 --> 35:57.655
"I think we need a New York backlot set."
And I think, at first, people were like,

35:57.738 --> 36:00.575
<i>"I don't know, Jamie." He said,</i>
<i>"Guys, just let me prove it to you."</i>

36:00.658 --> 36:03.244
<i>And sure enough,</i>
<i>we have a whole small section</i>

36:03.327 --> 36:06.122
<i>that passes for Greenwich Village,</i>
<i>it passes for Midtown.</i>

36:06.205 --> 36:09.417
And we got about four blocks
of New York streets

36:09.500 --> 36:13.588
<i>with all the set dressing, you know,</i>
<i>a lot of it brought from New York.</i>

36:13.671 --> 36:16.799
A car is gonna flip over
and I have to try and not react to it.

36:18.801 --> 36:21.804
Kinda nervous. If I do end up reacting,
they might have to redo the whole thing.

36:21.888 --> 36:22.972
(SHUDDERS)

36:28.186 --> 36:29.228
RAIMI: And cut!

36:29.312 --> 36:32.106
And I did it. I'm proud of myself.
Pat on the back.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.986
A lot of the set has been built to be
ratcheted backwards, pushed over,

36:37.069 --> 36:40.948
hydraulically dropped, we got
big debris drops coming into the street.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.285
Anything that can be practical,
Sam wants practical.

36:44.368 --> 36:47.496
<i>Sam's got Chris Corbould on speed dial,</i>
<i>our special effects supervisor.</i>

36:47.580 --> 36:49.165
<i>He can call him in every day.</i>
<i>He's saying,</i>

36:49.248 --> 36:51.542
<i>"Chris, can we do this for real?</i>
<i>Can we do this for real?"</i>

36:51.626 --> 36:53.461
And, you know, we usually can.

36:53.544 --> 36:57.089
GOMEZ: <i>There was this one specific thing</i>
<i>we did in the New York streets.</i>

36:57.173 --> 37:01.135
<i>I'm running</i>
<i>and they had all these special effects.</i>

37:01.219 --> 37:04.013
<i>Like, lights were going off,</i>
<i>a tree was falling,</i>

37:04.096 --> 37:07.308
<i>cars were crashing into each other,</i>
<i>a fire hydrant goes off,</i>

37:07.391 --> 37:09.685
<i>a building completely collapses behind me.</i>

37:09.769 --> 37:13.314
There's more than probably
30-40 different gags in there,

37:13.397 --> 37:17.193
all with a different mechanical mechanism.
It's a great moment.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.278
This is probably one of the larger sets.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.448
Probably the largest set on the movie.

37:22.740 --> 37:25.409
And it's probably one of the largest sets
I've ever built, I'd say.

37:25.493 --> 37:27.745
But all of these images on the wall
shows you

37:28.246 --> 37:30.081
what, in fact, we ended up building.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.542
I saw it when it was just wood
and now I'm seeing it all done

37:33.626 --> 37:36.462
and I'm like, "Oh, my gosh."
The detail they have put in.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.381
<i>Looks exactly like New York.</i>

37:38.464 --> 37:41.592
It makes you hungry. Because all these
restaurants look pretty awesome.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.804
PALMER: <i>It's a testament to Charlie Wood's</i>
<i>production design team</i>

37:44.887 --> 37:48.224
and to our executive producer,
Jamie Christopher, who came up

37:48.307 --> 37:50.977
with the crazy idea to go build it.
It's amazing.

37:51.060 --> 37:53.187
<i>Not only does it pass for New York</i>
<i>in our universe,</i>

37:53.271 --> 37:55.523
<i>it passes for New York</i>
<i>in multiple universes.</i>

37:56.190 --> 37:58.901
WOOD: <i>This set serves three purposes.</i>

37:59.443 --> 38:02.113
Because we have three different realities
in the film.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.865
Sam, you know, I remember being
in a meeting with him one day

38:04.949 --> 38:07.702
and he was like, "Gosh, how are we gonna
sell to everyone

38:07.785 --> 38:11.205
"that this is the exact same place
they were in that universe before?"

38:11.289 --> 38:14.083
<i>And he had an idea of, every scene</i>
<i>where they land in New York,</i>

38:14.166 --> 38:17.503
<i>they kind of land in the same alley.</i>
<i>So, it was very important for him,</i>

38:17.586 --> 38:20.047
for all of the storyboard artists,
and all the previz artists,

38:20.131 --> 38:24.218
across all of the scenes,
to really make this exit from the alley

38:24.302 --> 38:29.223
and this turn down the avenue recognizable
every time you came to that universe.

38:29.307 --> 38:33.602
The different dimensions are on the same
street where originally one was a normal,

38:33.686 --> 38:37.732
busy New York street.
The second one was snowbound.

38:37.815 --> 38:42.153
So, it was totally snowed up
with weird cars floating in the air

38:42.236 --> 38:44.989
<i>which we hung up on cranes</i>
<i>and were rotating.</i>

38:45.364 --> 38:49.035
So, you've got this weird, surreal,
deserted New York.

38:49.493 --> 38:51.829
Because we're chopping and changing
as we shoot

38:51.912 --> 38:53.873
between these three different periods,

38:53.956 --> 38:56.917
<i>we wouldn't have time</i>
<i>to physically change the street.</i>

38:57.001 --> 39:00.129
And one of the easiest ways of doing it
is with snow.

39:00.629 --> 39:04.175
<i>Because this is something we can literally</i>
<i>do in a day and it's effective, yeah?</i>

39:04.258 --> 39:07.928
And this wanted to be
a much more abstract, haunting place.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.932
A look like this
is the right way to go, I think.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.434
I mean, it's rather Dickensian.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.729
Eventually they get to the end
and the snow turns into black sand

39:16.812 --> 39:20.691
<i>with a wave, from an Atlantic wave</i>
<i>coming across the road.</i>

39:23.444 --> 39:27.031
WOOD: <i>With Sanctum Sanctorum.</i>
<i>I think we rebuilt the foyer for...</i>

39:27.114 --> 39:28.616
<i>I know I've built it three times.</i>

39:28.699 --> 39:32.036
And I think it's been built by a couple
of other films a couple of times.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.163
I think that's
number four or number five.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.833
<i>We changed it a bit in this reiteration.</i>
<i>We always do.</i>

39:37.917 --> 39:40.628
<i>And then we had to come up</i>
<i>with another room, a big room,</i>

39:40.711 --> 39:44.090
<i>based on a kind of Victorian salon</i>
<i>with a glass roof</i>

39:44.173 --> 39:47.009
<i>that has become</i>
<i>one of the main spaces in the house.</i>

39:48.969 --> 39:52.723
<i>We ended up recreating again the foyer,</i>
<i>which is the entrance hall</i>

39:52.807 --> 39:54.475
<i>that leads into the house.</i>

39:54.892 --> 39:58.270
With the Sinister Sanctum, Charlie wanted
to do something completely different.

39:58.354 --> 40:02.525
<i>So, he wanted to make it bigger,</i>
<i>more unusual, more "out-there."</i>

40:02.608 --> 40:06.612
<i>So, as you open the front door,</i>
<i>you come into this black beach.</i>

40:06.695 --> 40:10.741
<i>Architecturally, it could be elongated,</i>
<i>it could be expanded, it could be open.</i>

40:10.825 --> 40:12.159
<i>You could be open to the elements.</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:15.538
WOOD: <i>So, it's really kind of</i>
<i>our most abstract world.</i>

40:15.621 --> 40:18.290
We tried very hard to
make each experience,

40:18.374 --> 40:20.584
each place you go something different.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.921
<i>By the time we'd got to Mount Wundagore,</i>

40:24.004 --> 40:28.134
we felt that this world should be
much more primeval than anything else

40:28.217 --> 40:29.260
<i>we were doing on the film.</i>

40:29.343 --> 40:32.304
<i>In the comics, Mount Wundagore</i>
<i>is a castle-like structure</i>

40:32.388 --> 40:34.932
<i>in this snowy mountain range</i>

40:35.015 --> 40:37.184
<i>and we looked at</i>
<i>a lot of stuff from Petra.</i>

40:37.268 --> 40:41.105
We'd wanted to come up with something
which was carved from the mountain.

40:41.188 --> 40:44.400
<i>We ended up finding this beautiful</i>
<i>mountain range in the Dolomites, in Italy.</i>

40:44.483 --> 40:47.153
<i>So that was our setting.</i>
<i>Then we had this big conversation</i>

40:47.236 --> 40:49.447
with the studio about
how it should be adorned,

40:49.530 --> 40:53.868
<i>and all of the inscriptions and all of</i>
<i>this language we see in the</i> Darkhold.

40:53.951 --> 40:58.080
<i>So, that was all built into the design</i>
<i>of the walls of this temple.</i>

40:58.164 --> 41:01.292
To me, the sets are one of the most
magical things that you get to see

41:01.375 --> 41:05.129
on these films,
because it's so world-building.

41:05.212 --> 41:09.216
<i>Mount Wundagore, I just thought they did</i>
<i>such a beautiful job.</i>

41:09.300 --> 41:15.181
I'm having them ship it overseas,
so that I can have it in my backyard.

41:16.223 --> 41:19.602
Another area where we're really
referencing the comics on this movie

41:19.685 --> 41:20.728
is for the spells.

41:21.187 --> 41:24.148
<i>So, there's all of these spells</i>
<i>that Doctor Strange has</i>

41:24.231 --> 41:27.026
and we need to come up with new spells
that haven't been seen somewhere else.

41:27.109 --> 41:29.153
<i>Keeping it fresh is really important.</i>

41:30.654 --> 41:32.656
<i>The characters to be in the situation</i>
<i>that they're in</i>

41:32.740 --> 41:36.202
<i>and have a spell</i>
<i>from the Marvel history books.</i>

41:39.497 --> 41:41.499
I'm mostly doing the spell

41:41.582 --> 41:45.211
and hand gesture movements
for Doctor Strange, Wong.

41:45.294 --> 41:47.630
<i>I've also worked on</i> Infinity War, Endgame.

41:47.713 --> 41:50.424
They saw the work that I did
on a previous commercial.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.843
<i>I was doing tutting,</i>
<i>which is a very niche dance style</i>

41:52.927 --> 41:55.095
<i>that uses shapes with hands and arms.</i>

41:55.471 --> 41:57.431
<i>They were like,</i>
<i>"Well, what could we do with that?"</i>

41:57.515 --> 42:00.226
So, in one of these moves,
he is ripping open a bus,

42:00.309 --> 42:03.270
kind of like dissecting it,
and anytime something involves

42:03.354 --> 42:07.358
levitation or a movement of matter,
this is involved.

42:07.441 --> 42:09.652
So, if you see, like, he's flying, right?

42:09.735 --> 42:11.862
If he's flying with his cloak,
he's also using these.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.698
But that's him, he's the matter.
So, in this, the bus is the matter

42:14.782 --> 42:18.035
and he's connecting to it.
And then he's just splitting it.

42:18.118 --> 42:20.371
<i>In my head, as soon as he's dissected</i>
<i>this thing,</i>

42:20.454 --> 42:22.873
his energy is already connected
to each and every piece.

42:22.957 --> 42:27.127
<i>So, you'll see, like, he chops one</i>
<i>of the legs off 'cause he's dissected it</i>

42:27.211 --> 42:29.880
and he's still connected to it.
You can just pick one out and chop it.

42:29.964 --> 42:32.550
He doesn't have to do another spell.
He's already connected to it.

42:35.678 --> 42:36.720
(GROANS)

42:39.098 --> 42:40.182
(GRUNTS)

42:40.891 --> 42:42.893
(SCREAMS)

42:46.146 --> 42:48.482
OCHS: <i>That shot had</i>
<i>a pretty amazing history.</i>

42:49.191 --> 42:51.485
<i>We started with many, many ideas.</i>

42:51.569 --> 42:54.780
<i>Probably 30 ideas</i>
<i>of different environments that could be</i>

42:54.863 --> 42:57.992
<i>something that you've never seen before.</i>
<i>Just this ride through the universes.</i>

42:58.284 --> 43:01.120
Our visual effects supervisor,
Janek Sirrs.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.581
<i>I mean, he was kind of really</i>
<i>the mastermind behind that shot</i>

43:03.664 --> 43:05.374
<i>and a lot of the shots in our movie.</i>

43:05.457 --> 43:07.418
He really came up with the worlds
that we wanted to explore

43:07.501 --> 43:09.587
so there was a lot of talk
about which world do we wanna do.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.380
<i>Well, here's some cool ideas.</i>
<i>Here's an all-bone world</i>

43:11.463 --> 43:15.009
<i>and here's a world that's futuristic.</i>
<i>Here's a world where everybody's paint.</i>

43:15.092 --> 43:19.138
OCHS: <i>And I think we ended up with</i>
<i>about 15 universes that are in there now.</i>

43:19.221 --> 43:22.725
<i>Lots of little Easter eggs in there.</i>
<i>I think the whole thing was challenging</i>

43:22.808 --> 43:25.436
<i>because there's so many elements</i>
<i>that go from shot-to-shot</i>

43:25.519 --> 43:29.815
<i>and you couldn't really work it</i>
<i>as a punch-in. It had to be one long shot.</i>

43:30.941 --> 43:34.153
MURAWSKI: <i>And then the next part of that</i>
<i>was creating the soundtrack for it.</i>

43:34.236 --> 43:37.489
<i>And our sound designer, Jussi Tegelman,</i>
<i>really spent a lot of work.</i>

43:37.573 --> 43:40.409
Because, you know, every one
should have a different soundscape.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.536
<i>Every one should feel like</i>
<i>a different universe.</i>

43:43.537 --> 43:46.749
In the Multiverse,
there are alternate versions

43:46.832 --> 43:48.417
of everyone and everything.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.543
<i>So, it gives the characters</i>

43:49.627 --> 43:51.795
<i>the dramatic opportunity</i>
<i>to meet themselves.</i>

43:51.920 --> 43:53.797
I'm just one of us.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.258
PALMER: <i>Out of the infinite</i>
<i>Doctor Stranges in the Multiverse,</i>

43:56.342 --> 43:59.303
we do get to meet a few in this movie.
We've given them different nicknames.

43:59.386 --> 44:00.721
One is Defender Strange.

44:00.804 --> 44:03.265
The first Strange that we meet,
Defender Strange,

44:03.349 --> 44:05.476
<i>we wanted him to be</i>
<i>a little bit of a swashbuckler.</i>

44:05.559 --> 44:07.102
<i>Little bit of an adventurer.</i>

44:07.186 --> 44:08.479
(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

44:08.937 --> 44:14.943
Lot of the fabrics in the costume are like
vintage fabrics from regions of Pakistan.

44:15.027 --> 44:17.196
I think he was
a little more of a fun-loving,

44:17.279 --> 44:20.366
Patrick Swayze in <i>Point Break</i>
kind of Strange.

44:20.783 --> 44:22.993
Somewhere out there
I had a ponytail.

44:23.911 --> 44:28.707
WALDRON: <i>You've got then the Strange</i>
<i>in the universe with the Illuminati.</i>

44:28.791 --> 44:32.836
He was Sorcerer Supreme in this universe.
Which was probably even less fun.

44:32.920 --> 44:37.257
The look goes back to earlier
comic versions

44:37.341 --> 44:39.176
where Strange had a blue cloak.

44:39.259 --> 44:42.429
We're doing the biggest collar ever seen
so far.

44:42.513 --> 44:46.642
WALDRON: <i>He was a little more emotionally</i>
<i>buttoned-up, maladjusted.</i>

44:46.725 --> 44:49.937
Probably spent more time
negging Christine.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.648
I guess it worked because she didn't
get married in that universe.

44:53.315 --> 44:55.275
<i>And then you have Sinister Strange.</i>

44:55.359 --> 44:57.569
-Are you happy, Stephen?
-What?

44:57.653 --> 45:01.323
CHURCHYARD: <i>So, it is essentially</i>
<i>the same costume that he wore in</i> Endgame,

45:01.407 --> 45:05.994
<i>and so, we've repurposed the disciple</i>
<i>costume and aged it down much more,</i>

45:06.078 --> 45:08.956
<i>and created a texture treatment to it.</i>

45:09.039 --> 45:11.125
WALDRON: <i>With Benedict,</i>
<i>because he is Doctor Strange,</i>

45:11.208 --> 45:14.002
it's been such a collaboration
from start to finish.

45:14.086 --> 45:16.672
I just really wanted to push
on the darker edge

45:16.755 --> 45:19.299
of what was a potential face-off
in this film.

45:19.383 --> 45:23.095
<i>The gist was more thrilling,</i>
<i>was more sinister, more adventurous.</i>

45:23.178 --> 45:27.057
<i>The artwork that was already in place,</i>
<i>very early on for this, is amazing.</i>

45:27.141 --> 45:29.768
<i>This picture of the Sanctum</i>
<i>kind of bleeding off into infinity.</i>

45:29.852 --> 45:30.978
It's really good fun.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.149
RAIMI: <i>And then we have Dead Strange.</i>

45:35.399 --> 45:37.901
Our Strange was trapped
in an alternate universe.

45:38.235 --> 45:40.988
<i>And he had to get back to our universe</i>
<i>to help save America.</i>

45:41.071 --> 45:44.199
But he couldn't get there,
except by Dreamwalking.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.994
<i>This ugly spell</i>
<i>where you can take your spirit</i>

45:47.077 --> 45:48.412
and send it across the universe

45:48.495 --> 45:50.831
and inhabit your alt self
in that universe.

45:52.207 --> 45:56.795
Unfortunately, the only version of himself
in that reality he needs to get to

45:56.879 --> 45:58.464
is a corpse,

45:58.547 --> 46:04.219
which does lead to very <i>Evil Dead-ish,</i>
very Sam Raimi hero, Dead Strange.

46:04.303 --> 46:08.098
When we pitched Dead Strange to Kevin,
we made sure that we partnered it

46:08.182 --> 46:09.892
<i>with an even stupider pitch.</i>

46:09.975 --> 46:12.144
What if there was a blob version
of Strange?

46:12.227 --> 46:15.647
Because we knew that that's how
we're gonna get a Zombie Strange.

46:15.731 --> 46:19.109
It was a little bit of a learning curve.
How do you pilot a dead body?

46:19.193 --> 46:25.073
I wanted that character to have conflict.
What problems could a Zombie Strange have?

46:25.365 --> 46:29.578
<i>Well, in my mind, he was doing something</i>
<i>that was against the laws of the universe.</i>

46:29.661 --> 46:32.790
<i>That there could be demons</i>
<i>that would try and stop him.</i>

46:32.873 --> 46:35.584
<i>But he is Doctor Strange.</i>
<i>He's Master of the Mystic Arts.</i>

46:35.667 --> 46:39.671
<i>Nobody, certainly not a bunch of sprits</i>
<i>or demons, can stop him.</i>

46:39.755 --> 46:43.091
So, he takes these spirits and demons
and weaves them together

46:43.175 --> 46:47.721
<i>into a Cloak of Souls that he uses</i>
<i>to propel him forward into his battle.</i>

46:47.805 --> 46:49.223
<i>Now, he is their master.</i>

46:55.145 --> 46:57.940
An evil book, full of evil magic.

46:58.690 --> 47:02.611
A vintage Oldsmobile
that couldn't possibly pass a smog test.

47:02.694 --> 47:05.697
A handsome dark-haired devil
with a chin that could kill.

47:05.781 --> 47:07.699
If all of this sounds very familiar,

47:07.783 --> 47:10.661
then I'd say you have extremely good taste
in movies.

47:11.161 --> 47:14.665
<i>But listen, my friend Sam Raimi</i>
<i>was dropping so-called Easter eggs</i>

47:14.748 --> 47:18.043
into his films when cellphones
were the size of house cats,

47:18.418 --> 47:22.339
<i>and Sam has carried on that tradition</i>
<i>with his latest cinematic opus.</i>

47:22.673 --> 47:25.509
So, keep your peepers properly peeled
during the movie,

47:25.592 --> 47:26.760
and you're bound to come across

47:26.844 --> 47:29.721
what we in the biz
like to call Raimi-isms.

47:31.390 --> 47:35.227
You know, I think the genius of Sam
is he's able to balance all those genres.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.355
This time, it's gonna take more
than killing me to kill me.

47:39.189 --> 47:41.316
MURAWSKI: <i>And for years, it was</i>
<i>a huge problem with the studios.</i>

47:41.400 --> 47:42.734
They said, "You have to pick a lane."

47:42.818 --> 47:44.987
<i>And they didn't understand</i>
<i>Sam's genre-bending</i>

47:45.070 --> 47:47.531
<i>and they didn't understand</i>
<i>the tone shifts and everything else.</i>

47:47.614 --> 47:50.117
<i>And that's something I really give</i>
<i>Marvel credit for, you know.</i>

47:50.200 --> 47:52.744
<i>They got behind it.</i>
<i>Played more to Sam's strengths.</i>

47:52.828 --> 47:56.331
So, over the course of the shooting,
they kept adding more horror elements.

47:56.540 --> 48:00.752
When Kevin Feige announced that he wanted
to bring a little bit of a horror element

48:00.836 --> 48:03.046
to <i>Doctor Strange,</i>
that was interesting to me.

48:03.130 --> 48:04.381
<i>I love to dabble in horror.</i>

48:04.464 --> 48:08.010
<i>It's always been a fun aspect</i>
<i>of movie-making for me.</i>

48:08.093 --> 48:11.638
I saw <i>Evil Dead 1</i> when it came out.
I just thought the movie was incredible.

48:11.930 --> 48:15.309
And Sam always has a lot of cool motifs
that he puts in his movies time and again.

48:15.642 --> 48:17.603
<i>I mean, you can</i>
<i>trace all these things back.</i>

48:20.314 --> 48:23.108
<i>Sam used a lot of the same people</i>
<i>from</i> Evil Dead 1.

48:23.191 --> 48:26.612
I'm Bruce Campbell and I'm playing
the role of the pizza guy.

48:26.695 --> 48:28.030
(EXCLAIMS ANGRILY)

48:28.113 --> 48:30.574
I'm glad that's over. (GROANS)

48:30.657 --> 48:34.244
<i>You know, we spoke with</i>
<i>the head of Marvel and threatened him</i>

48:34.328 --> 48:39.082
and said that he couldn't do any Marvel
without me, especially if Sam's directing.

48:39.166 --> 48:41.209
MURAWSKI: <i>It's good to see</i>
<i>those guys work together.</i>

48:41.293 --> 48:43.754
They have the kind of shorthand
that only comes from

48:43.837 --> 48:45.672
<i>working together</i>
<i>since you're ten years old.</i>

48:45.756 --> 48:48.634
CAMPBELL: <i>It's important for the editors</i>
<i>to always have stuff to cut out.</i>

48:49.134 --> 48:51.553
That's what I'm providing.
Especially Academy Award...

48:51.637 --> 48:53.096
-Yes, it is.
-Yeah. See?

48:53.180 --> 48:57.684
Especially Academy Award winning editors.
They love to play cutty-cut-cut.

48:57.768 --> 49:01.480
"Oh, look at me cut, look at me cut."
Yeah, see, he's already doing it.

49:01.563 --> 49:03.023
-I'm already cut.
-Trying to keep 'em honest.

49:03.106 --> 49:05.567
He was on the cutting room floor
but we ended up

49:05.651 --> 49:06.944
putting him back in at the last minute.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.070
CAMPBELL: <i>Thanks for nothin'.</i>

49:08.946 --> 49:10.113
Unbelievable.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.240
MURAWSKI: <i>Bruce was almost like</i>
<i>a prop for Sam.</i>

49:12.324 --> 49:13.951
<i>He could tell Bruce to do anything.</i>

49:14.034 --> 49:16.995
<i>"Bruce, throw yourself on the ground.</i>
<i>Hit yourself over the head with a pan."</i>

49:17.079 --> 49:18.997
Yeah, I gotta go beat myself up some more.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.082
(GRUNTS)

49:20.165 --> 49:21.166
Yeah, cheers.

49:21.416 --> 49:24.586
And then, I think, once Sam started
to work with, like, professional actors,

49:24.670 --> 49:26.171
<i>they weren't so malleable.</i>

49:26.505 --> 49:29.216
When I heard Sam
was directing this movie, I said,

49:29.299 --> 49:33.011
"You know, Sam, you realize
that you're working with an actual actor?

49:33.095 --> 49:35.055
"You might actually have to
kinda get ready?

49:36.181 --> 49:39.559
"He's not just gonna make silly faces
for you, like I did for years.

49:40.102 --> 49:44.690
"He might ask questions about motivation,
so you better step up your game.

49:44.773 --> 49:47.359
"I saw <i>Sherlock Holmes.</i> That boy can act."

49:47.442 --> 49:49.569
(GRUNTS)

49:53.240 --> 49:56.201
If he looks at me,
I always never make eye contact.

49:56.451 --> 49:58.704
<i>I always pretend</i>
<i>like I'm looking at my script.</i>

49:59.204 --> 50:00.330
I know all the tricks.

50:00.414 --> 50:04.793
<i>"Can I get you anything, Mr. Cumberbatch?"</i>
<i>And if he screws up a line, I own it.</i>

50:05.627 --> 50:07.254
"Benedict, that was me.

50:07.337 --> 50:09.715
"That was my mistake. Sorry."

50:09.798 --> 50:11.133
I got this all figured out.

50:11.800 --> 50:15.012
MURAWSKI: <i>Of all the directors I've</i>
<i>worked with, Sam is one of the best</i>

50:15.095 --> 50:16.138
<i>working with the actors.</i>

50:16.221 --> 50:17.723
He understands the power of a good shot.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.475
<i>And the choreography</i>
<i>between the camera and the actor.</i>

50:20.559 --> 50:25.647
He just has a really good sense and his
eye on every single detail of the film.

50:25.731 --> 50:29.317
For me, the fun has been
just how he moves the camera.

50:29.401 --> 50:31.945
<i>Stuff that's really inventive</i>
<i>and really fun.</i>

50:33.196 --> 50:36.074
MURAWSKI: <i>Sam always has</i>
<i>a lot of cool mirror gags in his movies,</i>

50:36.158 --> 50:37.159
from <i>Evil Dead 1.</i>

50:37.617 --> 50:40.203
<i>The whole scene where the Scarlet Witch</i>
<i>is caught in the mirror trap</i>

50:40.287 --> 50:44.291
<i>and she was using the puddles,</i>
<i>and the gong as a mirror to get out of.</i>

50:46.084 --> 50:48.086
<i>The mirror thing is something</i>
<i>he's always been interested in,</i>

50:48.170 --> 50:51.381
and the duality of the characters.
Of course, the Delta 88.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.842
WOOD: <i>We got Sam Raimi's car, yeah?</i>
<i>The Delta 88.</i>

50:54.176 --> 50:55.719
Sam's fans are gonna love this bit.

50:55.802 --> 50:57.971
The Delta 88 is the ultimate Easter egg.

50:58.055 --> 51:01.516
When I was a film student,
we'd always love to see the Delta 88

51:01.600 --> 51:03.060
in the Sam Raimi movies.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.520
<i>In</i> Spider-Man <i>and</i> Spider-Man 2,

51:05.604 --> 51:08.648
I remember walking into the stage one day
and going, "There's the car!"

51:08.732 --> 51:10.859
Yeah, the '73 Delta 88.

51:10.942 --> 51:15.280
It's been in every one of Sam's movies,
including his western.

51:15.363 --> 51:19.201
Yeah, he had the body taken off
and put a wagon over the chassis

51:19.284 --> 51:21.953
so he could say (IMITATING RAIMI)
"It's been in all my movies."

51:22.037 --> 51:26.333
WOOD: <i>We actually got a bloody great big</i>
<i>crane and puppeteered it down the street</i>

51:26.416 --> 51:28.043
<i>in this kind of snowstorm.</i>

51:28.126 --> 51:30.045
And you get to see a few versions
of the car.

51:33.006 --> 51:35.342
I've done everything I can
to destroy that car,

51:35.425 --> 51:38.011
<i>because I don't appreciate</i>
<i>Sam's infatuation with it.</i>

51:38.095 --> 51:40.555
<i>He won't really let me near it</i>
<i>'cause he knows</i>

51:40.639 --> 51:42.516
<i>I will silently slit the seats.</i>

51:42.599 --> 51:45.268
And one day, he might just wake up
and it's gone.

51:45.352 --> 51:46.478
(LAUGHS)

51:46.561 --> 51:50.941
<i>The amazing thing is, it's not even</i>
<i>a fake version of the car. That's the car.</i>

51:51.024 --> 51:53.652
<i>It was actually the car that we drove</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

51:53.735 --> 51:57.072
And I know when you open the door
and the key is in it, it goes...

51:57.280 --> 51:59.699
(MAKES WHINY NOISE)

51:59.783 --> 52:02.327
But I have to say, I hate it,
but I love it.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.412
<i>When I sit back in that car,</i>

52:04.496 --> 52:07.082
<i>you really do, honestly,</i>
<i>not even exaggerating,</i>

52:07.165 --> 52:11.253
you get a flood of memories that come back
from that piece of crap.

52:11.795 --> 52:15.090
It's always fun to work with Sam.
He's really funny and entertaining

52:15.382 --> 52:18.677
<i>and he's very serious</i>
<i>about things, but at the same time,</i>

52:18.760 --> 52:20.428
<i>-doesn't take things seriously.</i>
-(LAUGHS)

52:20.512 --> 52:22.597
That is fine.
Let us go. Let's go, you animals.

52:22.681 --> 52:26.685
I think one of the things that's most fun
for me about watching one of Sam's films

52:26.768 --> 52:31.606
<i>and working on Sam's films is just the joy</i>
<i>that he has in the process,</i>

52:32.315 --> 52:33.775
<i>in the art form.</i>

52:34.151 --> 52:38.697
I don't know anybody that quite loves
cinema the way that Sam does.

52:38.780 --> 52:40.824
Can I have even more of,
"It feels good to be back."

52:40.907 --> 52:42.200
-Okay.
-"This is who I am."

52:42.284 --> 52:43.493
-Okay.
-You ready?

52:43.577 --> 52:45.120
WALDRON: <i>I've learned so much from him.</i>

52:45.203 --> 52:49.332
Just the way he conducts the orchestra
of the movie,

52:49.416 --> 52:52.794
<i>working with me on script pages,</i>
<i>directing the cameras,</i>

52:52.878 --> 52:55.463
swinging across a set, you know,
working with the actors.

52:55.547 --> 52:59.384
I love that elegance. That was beautiful.
Perfectly timed with the move too.

52:59.467 --> 53:00.510
That's great, man.

53:00.594 --> 53:02.679
I want you to play this more vulnerable
than I've ever seen.

53:02.762 --> 53:04.890
I love all that emotion. Give me a double.

53:04.973 --> 53:06.725
All right, let's take it back to one.

53:06.808 --> 53:09.394
WALDRON: <i>Every day, when we're</i>
<i>starting in on a new scene,</i>

53:09.477 --> 53:11.021
it's like, let's look at this

53:11.104 --> 53:13.523
<i>as if this is the most important scene</i>
<i>in the movie.</i>

53:13.607 --> 53:16.985
NOLAN: <i>He is just so aware of</i>
<i>every aspect of filmmaking.</i>

53:17.068 --> 53:21.114
I think a few weeks ago, Bob Murawski,
the other editor who's been with Sam

53:21.198 --> 53:26.328
for 25-30 years said something like,
"If Sam sat in every single chair,

53:26.411 --> 53:28.413
<i>"he would be able to pick it up</i>
<i>and do it right away,"</i>

53:28.496 --> 53:31.625
'cause he's just so aware
of what every person on a film is doing.

53:31.708 --> 53:34.794
Sam has fostered such
a collaborative environment,

53:34.878 --> 53:38.006
<i>Sam really wanted to make sure</i>
<i>that we had the best ideas on the table.</i>

53:40.050 --> 53:41.927
-RAIMI: I think it's gonna work.
-I think so.

53:42.010 --> 53:43.720
Yeah, I can't ask for better.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.475
Guys, thank you very much.
This was a great place to live and work.

53:48.558 --> 53:50.894
You guys were wonderful.

53:51.728 --> 53:53.146
So, so professional.

53:53.563 --> 53:57.192
I really appreciate that, and I've learned
a lot from so many of you,

53:57.275 --> 53:59.861
made some good friends,
and the movie will be a lot of fun

53:59.945 --> 54:03.281
thanks to all your hard work,
and inventiveness, and craftsmanship.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.950
Thank you very much. I salute all of you.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.034
MAN: Thank you.

54:06.117 --> 54:07.661
(ALL APPLAUDING)

54:08.995 --> 54:11.456
MCADAMS: <i>It's a real honor</i>
<i>to be in the family.</i>

54:11.539 --> 54:14.084
So many talented people
all working together

54:14.167 --> 54:17.087
<i>to take people on this incredible journey.</i>

54:17.170 --> 54:20.006
It does feel like one of
the biggest things Marvel's ever done.

54:20.382 --> 54:26.137
It's pretty unfathomably exciting to be
the test pilot for all things Multiversal.

54:26.513 --> 54:30.267
<i>We've got this amazing canvas</i>
<i>of imagination to sort of bounce off ideas</i>

54:30.350 --> 54:33.645
of what the human condition is and
what the challenges that we all face are

54:33.728 --> 54:37.023
and what the best version of ourselves
could possibly be.

54:37.524 --> 54:42.529
Protecting America Chavez becomes not just
about protecting his universe

54:42.612 --> 54:44.197
but protecting his friend.

54:44.489 --> 54:50.245
<i>He's capable of emotional growth in a way</i>
<i>he was never able to demonstrate before.</i>

54:52.122 --> 54:54.207
CUMBERBATCH: <i>What he comes to realize</i>
<i>in that relationship</i>

54:54.291 --> 54:55.750
<i>is he has to empower her,</i>

54:55.834 --> 54:58.962
he has to give up control himself.
It's not about him.

54:59.045 --> 55:01.131
It's actually about somebody else.

55:01.214 --> 55:05.302
Of course, being an egotistical hero,
he's scrambling around in every universe

55:05.385 --> 55:08.430
<i>for the answer for the weapon,</i>
<i>for the surgeon's knife</i>

55:08.513 --> 55:11.349
in order to save the day and not realizing
all the time

55:11.433 --> 55:13.143
that the weapon is right in front of him.

55:13.226 --> 55:15.937
<i>It's someone who needs love, trust</i>
<i>and encouragement.</i>

55:17.063 --> 55:21.484
I think the lesson for Strange is really
how to be the best version of yourself,

55:22.152 --> 55:25.363
<i>and it's not necessarily</i>
<i>about self-perfection.</i>

55:25.447 --> 55:27.574
It can be about helping someone else

55:27.657 --> 55:30.368
rather than thinking that
you can do it all yourself.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.413
A real hero has to believe in others.

55:33.913 --> 55:35.123
This is the only way.

55:36.499 --> 55:41.254
RAIMI: <i>He allows himself to believe</i>
<i>in America Chavez and she saves the day.</i>

55:41.338 --> 55:42.464
(GRUNTS)

55:43.757 --> 55:46.718
<i>And that's the beauty of</i>
<i>these comic books, these heroes,</i>

55:46.801 --> 55:50.555
<i>is that they show us the people</i>
<i>that we can be, what we're capable of.</i>

55:53.892 --> 55:57.812
Wanda doesn't actually do the work
that maybe someone like Strange

55:57.896 --> 56:01.691
is gonna eventually have to do, which is,
take a look at our surroundings

56:01.775 --> 56:04.861
and how we treat one another
and find something that is in front of us

56:04.944 --> 56:08.865
as opposed to what we are leaping
different universes for.

56:09.741 --> 56:13.703
Where does it leave the MCU?
We've blown the lid on the Multiverse now.

56:14.120 --> 56:17.123
PALMER: <i>The Multiverse is going to be</i>
<i>so big in the future of the MCU,</i>

56:17.207 --> 56:19.542
<i>primarily because of the events</i>
<i>of this movie.</i>

56:19.626 --> 56:20.960
After <i>Infinity War</i> and <i>Endgame,</i>

56:21.044 --> 56:24.005
<i>Doctor Strange was poised to be</i>
<i>the chief protector of the MCU,</i>

56:24.089 --> 56:25.131
but now, in this movie,

56:25.215 --> 56:28.385
<i>we see Doctor Strange become not just</i>
<i>the protector of the MCU,</i>

56:28.468 --> 56:31.763
<i>but the protector of the Multiverse</i>
<i>within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</i>

56:32.555 --> 56:36.643
What's compelling about where he's left
is that third eye opens,

56:37.143 --> 56:40.438
and now there's this evil awakened
within him.

56:40.730 --> 56:42.357
I think it begs the question,

56:42.607 --> 56:48.947
<i>is what makes Doctor Strange happy?</i>
<i>Could it possibly be not being a hero?</i>

56:50.490 --> 56:54.786
Marvel is always about finding
the humanity within the icon, right?

56:54.869 --> 56:58.123
<i>Finding the flaws beneath the cape</i>
<i>or the mask or the armor,</i>

56:58.206 --> 57:00.917
<i>and learning about who the human</i>
<i>is inside it.</i>

57:02.919 --> 57:04.587
PALMER: <i>Based on this ending,</i>

57:05.046 --> 57:06.840
<i>who knows where that could take us?</i>

57:06.923 --> 57:09.467
Into the Dark Dimension and beyond,
I don't know.

57:11.344 --> 57:14.931
RAIMI: <i>We're trying to give the audience</i>
<i>a mind-expanding experience,</i>

57:15.014 --> 57:19.144
<i>something that makes them talk</i>
<i>about the nature of reality in a fun way</i>

57:19.227 --> 57:23.356
<i>and ask questions like great comic books</i>
<i>or science fiction can do.</i>

57:28.361 --> 57:30.613
I don't know about you,
but being here today,

57:30.697 --> 57:32.574
I had an epiphany of sorts.

57:32.866 --> 57:36.244
I realized that making a film is not
unlike conjuring another facet

57:36.327 --> 57:37.579
of the Multiverse.

57:37.662 --> 57:40.915
It's about creating an alternate reality
from the ground up,

57:40.999 --> 57:43.835
where time and space can bend
any which way

57:43.918 --> 57:47.589
according to the whims of those pulling
the strings behind the scenes.

57:48.339 --> 57:52.469
I know that might sound a little lofty,
but well, I'm a lofty kinda guy.

57:52.844 --> 57:57.724
This is Bruce Campbell saying farewell,
until we meet again in the next dimension.
