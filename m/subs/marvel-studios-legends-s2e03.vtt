00:01.042 --> 00:03.044
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

00:28.945 --> 00:31.614
HANK: Your mother convinced me...

00:31.698 --> 00:34.534
to let her join me on my missions.

00:34.617 --> 00:36.953
Daddy and I have
a last-minute business trip.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.580
I don't want you to go.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.498
HANK: <i>They called her the Wasp.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:41.791
Oh, my God.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.543
They've already launched.

00:43.626 --> 00:44.753
JANET: <i>We have to stop it.</i>

00:44.836 --> 00:46.755
HANK: <i>She was born to it.</i>

00:48.214 --> 00:50.884
(INHALES) And there's not a day
that goes by...

00:50.967 --> 00:53.553
<i>that I don't regret having said yes.</i>

00:55.138 --> 00:57.640
-JANET: Tell Hope I love her.
<i>-</i>HANK:<i> Janet. No!</i>

00:57.724 --> 01:00.769
HANK: <i>She went subatomic</i>
<i>to deactivate the bomb.</i>

01:00.852 --> 01:04.522
<i>Your mother saved thousands of lives</i>
<i>that day</i>

01:04.606 --> 01:09.069
<i>knowing she'd be lost</i>
<i>in the quantum realm... forever.</i>

01:11.029 --> 01:15.158
Forty years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.452
-What does that mean?
-(WHIRRING)

01:17.535 --> 01:20.413
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.917
The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary
science ever developed.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.126
<i>Help us put it to good use.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:27.837
But it was too dangerous.
So I hid it from the world.

01:27.921 --> 01:31.591
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.553
As long as I am alive...

01:36.262 --> 01:39.099
nobody will ever get that formula.

01:39.516 --> 01:40.934
AUTOMATED VOICE: The Yellowjacket.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.393
Oh, no.

01:42.477 --> 01:45.897
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

01:45.980 --> 01:49.359
<i>He became obsessed</i>
<i>with recreating my formula.</i>

01:49.442 --> 01:50.902
<i>But I wouldn't help him.</i>

01:50.985 --> 01:53.196
DARREN: You tried to hide
your technology from me.

01:53.279 --> 01:55.240
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.284
Darren, don't do this.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.915
Hank, I'm a thief.
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.793
(HANK GRUNTING)

02:14.008 --> 02:16.219
HANK: <i>When Scott went</i>
<i>to the quantum realm...</i>

02:17.762 --> 02:18.805
<i>and came back...</i>

02:21.182 --> 02:22.892
I started to wonder...

02:23.518 --> 02:25.937
could your mother still be alive?

02:26.020 --> 02:28.189
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.151
You built all this
and you don't even know if she's alive?

02:31.234 --> 02:33.987
HANK: <i>Last night, we powered up</i>
<i>the tunnel for the first time.</i>

02:34.070 --> 02:35.697
HOPE:<i> And five minutes later, you called.</i>

02:35.780 --> 02:36.781
(GASPS)

02:36.865 --> 02:39.534
We think she might have put
some kind of a message in your head.

02:39.617 --> 02:42.370
<i>Hopefully, a location.</i>
<i>And opening the tunnel triggered it.</i>

02:42.453 --> 02:45.999
Your mom put a message in my head?
Come on. That's insane.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.921
-What are you doing?
-Get away from that!

02:52.005 --> 02:53.339
-Scott, you can't...
-I'm sorry,

02:53.423 --> 02:55.884
I don't have much time.
I need to fix the algorithm.

02:57.969 --> 02:58.970
Janet?

03:00.555 --> 03:03.016
SCOTT: <i>You have to meet me</i>
<i>at these exact coordinates.</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:06.144
You have two hours. After that,
the probability fields will shift

03:06.227 --> 03:08.938
<i>and it'll be another century</i>
<i>before they align like this again.</i>

03:09.022 --> 03:10.523
I'm coming to you, honey.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.823
Time and space
work very differently down here.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.534
AUTOMATED VOICE: Warning,
approaching quantum void.

03:23.786 --> 03:26.789
It's very dangerous,
especially on the human mind.

03:26.873 --> 03:27.999
(SCREAMING)

03:31.753 --> 03:34.422
You look lost, Hank. Are you all right?

03:37.759 --> 03:39.761
(HANK GASPING)

03:51.773 --> 03:52.774
It's me.
