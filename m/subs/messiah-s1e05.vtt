[Samer] "'Were they not satisfied
where they were?'"

37:21.155 --> 37:24.367
"asked the Little Prince..."

37:28.621 --> 37:32.959
"'No one is ever satisfied
where he is,'

37:34.001 --> 37:36.504
said the switchman."

37:42.093 --> 37:43.261
[footsteps approaching]

37:58.067 --> 37:59.402
What are you doin' here?

38:02.905 --> 38:04.115
I came for you.

[Samer, in Arabic]
"'All men have the stars..."

38:31.058 --> 38:34.770
"...but they are not the same things
for different people."

38:40.568 --> 38:45.323
<i>"For some, who are travelers,</i>
<i>the stars are guides..."</i>

38:47.491 --> 38:51.871
<i>"For others, they are no more</i>
<i>than little lights in the sky..."</i>

38:53.497 --> 39:00.463
<i>"But you...</i>
<i>you alone will have the stars</i>

39:00.546 --> 39:03.215
<i>as no one else has them."</i>
