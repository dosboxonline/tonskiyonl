00:32.240 --> 00:35.452
CAROL: You don't know me.
LAWSON: Go, Carol. Fly!

00:37.620 --> 00:39.873
CAROL: You have no idea who I am.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.876
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.881
My name is Carol.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.092
MARIA: You ready?

00:52.969 --> 00:54.971
-Higher, further, faster, baby.
-That's right.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.605
Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

01:08.068 --> 01:11.196
LAWSON: I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.741
YON-ROGG: The energy core. Where is it?

01:18.161 --> 01:21.331
She absorbed its power.
She's coming with us.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.295
CAROL: I can't tell what's real.
MARIA: You don't remember anything?

01:29.297 --> 01:31.925
CAROL: I see flashes.

01:33.885 --> 01:34.886
Little moments.

01:34.969 --> 01:35.970
Dreams again?

01:37.555 --> 01:40.141
-You have to let go of the past.
-I don't remember my past.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.688
Control your impulses.
Stop using this, start using this.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.732
LAWSON: You have a mission.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.068
The Skrulls have invaded
yet another border planet.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.402
This is a dangerous mission.

01:51.861 --> 01:54.322
-For the good of all Kree.
-ALL: For the good of all Kree!

01:58.034 --> 01:59.035
Skrulls!

01:59.410 --> 02:00.495
(GROANS)

02:10.213 --> 02:11.381
FURY: Excuse me, miss.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.259
You know anything
about a lady blowing a hole

02:14.342 --> 02:16.678
through the roof of that Blockbuster
over there?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.639
Witness says she was dressed
for laser tag.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.433
(GROANS)

02:23.935 --> 02:25.395
FURY: War is a universal language.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.565
I know a rogue soldier when I see one.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.317
You got a personal stake in this.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.069
I thought we'd lost you.

02:33.194 --> 02:35.738
I found evidence that I had a life here.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.324
-KORATH: She's compromised.
-She's stronger than you think.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.077
CAROL: I don't know who I am!

02:41.744 --> 02:43.663
You are Carol Danvers.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.540
My best friend,

02:45.999 --> 02:49.210
who supported me as a mother and a pilot
when no one else did.

02:50.920 --> 02:55.175
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass,

02:56.092 --> 02:58.970
and you were the most powerful person
I knew,

02:59.512 --> 03:01.973
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.602
You hear me? Come here.

03:07.937 --> 03:08.938
CAROL: He lied to me.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.983
Everything that I knew was a lie.

03:12.066 --> 03:17.530
You and I lost everything at the hands
of the Kree.

03:19.073 --> 03:21.409
CAROL: I can't wear
these Kree colors anymore.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.329
-How do I look?
-Fresh.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.666
Help us find the core.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.084
Buckle up, folks.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.631
Is that it? The core?

03:35.131 --> 03:36.341
TALOS: You found my family.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.469
Fraternizing with the enemy?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.681
What's given can be taken away.

03:43.765 --> 03:46.893
CAROL: I've been fighting
with one arm tied behind my back.

03:46.976 --> 03:50.480
But what happens
when I'm finally set free?

03:50.647 --> 03:51.773
Ronan, come at once.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.651
(GRUNTS)

04:05.161 --> 04:06.788
We'll be back for the weapon.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.166
The core?

04:11.876 --> 04:13.044
The woman.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.970
I'm so proud of you.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.475
You've come a long way since I found you
that day by the lake.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.771
But can you keep your emotions in check
long enough to take me on?

04:34.649 --> 04:37.068
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.445
The war. The lies.

04:40.738 --> 04:41.948
All of it.

04:44.033 --> 04:46.786
For emergencies only, okay?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.167
Nick.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.628
FURY: Hill.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.964
ROMANOFF: He did exactly what
he said he was gonna do.

04:58.047 --> 05:02.135
Thanos wiped out
50% of all living creatures.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.304
Oh, no.

05:09.767 --> 05:10.768
Where's Fury?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.979
-ROGERS: Where are you going?
-To kill Thanos.

05:13.062 --> 05:14.397
We usually work as a team here.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.608
We realize up there is more your
territory, but this is our fight, too.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.863
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

05:22.071 --> 05:23.781
Because before you didn't have me.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.368
I am inevitable.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.121
FRIDAY: Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.375
Oh, yeah!

05:38.129 --> 05:39.797
CAROL: I'm not gonna fight your war.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.886
I'm gonna end it.
