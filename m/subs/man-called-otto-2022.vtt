01:27.087 --> 01:28.589
Welcome to the store.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.424
Are you a Busy Beaver?

01:30.507 --> 01:33.510
No, I am not a Busy Beaver.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.597


01:39.766 --> 01:41.810
Are you a Frequent Beaver?

01:41.894 --> 01:43.729

01:43.812 --> 01:46.648
You can get your teeth
into our dam good deals.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.406
Don't forget:

01:54.489 --> 01:57.117
If you need help, ask a Beaver.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.745
Oh. Oh.

02:00.746 --> 02:03.123
Hey. Oh.
Can I, uh, help you with that, sir?

02:03.207 --> 02:05.417
Do you think
I don't know how to cut rope?

02:06.210 --> 02:08.628
No, it's just we usually do that for ya.

02:08.711 --> 02:12.841
Do you think I'm gonna cut myself
and bleed all over your floor and sue you?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
No.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.554
Then I don't need your help.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.641
Have an excellent day.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.936
I'm a Busy Beaver.

02:24.686 --> 02:25.687
Idiot.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.026
Did you, um, find everything
you were lookin' for today?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.402
Yes.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.487
Good.

02:34.947 --> 02:36.114
Let's see here.

02:40.202 --> 02:43.288
Uh, your total is 3.47.

02:43.372 --> 02:45.791
You charged me for 6 feet of rope.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.460
Oh, yes, it's 99¢ a yard.

02:48.544 --> 02:51.338
I didn't get 2 yards. I got 5 feet.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.467
Yeah, we don't charge by the foot.
We charge by the yard.

02:55.551 --> 02:59.388
99¢ a yard is 33¢ a foot,
times 5, that's 1.65.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.473
You charged me $1.98.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.851
You're good at math. Um...

03:03.934 --> 03:07.855
No, I know, but I can't put it into
the computer the way that you just said.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.066
What the hell kind of computer
can't do simple math?

03:11.817 --> 03:14.236
-Can I speak to your manager?
-He's at lunch.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.115
Lunch. All anyone cares about
these days is lunch.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.784
-Is there anyone else in charge?
-You want the assistant manager?

03:20.868 --> 03:22.911
-Yes, I'd like the assistant manager.
-'Kay.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.915
Hey, Taylor?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.835
Taylor? To the front register.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.003
What's up?

03:31.086 --> 03:32.087
Hey, Taylor.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.632
This is the assistant manager?
How old is she?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.342
Shouldn't you be in gym class?

03:37.426 --> 03:38.468
Sorry, what?

03:38.552 --> 03:39.803
Here. I got some change.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.514
Let me cover that extra 33¢ for you.

03:42.598 --> 03:46.476
Sir, I do not want your 33¢.
And this is not about 33¢.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.397
This is about the fact that I got 5 feet
of rope because I want 5 feet of rope.

03:50.480 --> 03:54.109
And I shouldn't have to pay
for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.445
Did you want another foot of rope?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.392


04:27.476 --> 04:30.395


05:05.764 --> 05:07.641
Not again.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.067
Hm.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.788
How hard can this be?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.148


05:56.231 --> 05:58.358
That bike goes over here.

05:58.442 --> 05:59.985
Hey! What the hell?

06:00.652 --> 06:01.945
That's mine.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.781
-It belongs in the bike rack.
-I was only gone half a minute.

06:05.991 --> 06:09.244
Next time, I'll lock it up
in the lost and found.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.289
Grumpy old bastard.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.041
Jeez.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.389
Not on the mirror.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.727
-Hey, Otto!

06:34.686 --> 06:36.688


06:39.900 --> 06:41.276
Okay.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.261
Hey!

07:34.121 --> 07:37.249
Don't you dare let that little rat dog
piss on my walkway again.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.876
-I know it was you.
-Ignore him, Prince.

07:38.959 --> 07:41.712
He's a nasty, bitter old man.
And he has no idea who's doing that.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.797
Well, it was one of you.

07:43.881 --> 07:48.719
And tell that useless boyfriend of yours
to stop stretching his groin in public.

07:50.637 --> 07:54.433
Looks like a 14-year-old Romanian gymnast,
for God's sakes.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
Go on. Get outta here.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.074
Go.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.949
There he is, the big man himself.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.204
What's all this?

08:57.287 --> 08:59.790
It's, well, retirement cake, I guess.
Call it what you like.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.625
"Have fun."

09:02.334 --> 09:03.669
"Have fun."

09:03.752 --> 09:04.962
Doing what?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.382
Have fun with the rest of your life.
We wanted to, you know...

09:09.091 --> 09:10.259
Celebrate?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.718
Yes! Well, no.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.303
Give you a nice send-off.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.806
"Nice."

09:15.889 --> 09:16.974
Come on, Otto.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
You're the one who decided to leave.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.353
And you did get a nice severance package.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.356
You took me off Operations.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.233
You cut back on my hours.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.736
You made Terry,
who I trained, my supervisor.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.282
Terry, who can barely figure out
what year it is without his phone.

09:33.365 --> 09:36.618
So, yes, I took the severance package.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.203
I'm sorry you see it that way.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.956
We all had to adjust after the merger.

09:41.039 --> 09:44.877
But you've been quite an asset
to this company over the years, so--

09:44.960 --> 09:47.129
You have. Reliable as hell.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.006
We're gonna miss
those schedules of yours.

09:50.966 --> 09:51.800
To Otto!

09:51.884 --> 09:54.469
-To Otto!
-To Otto.

09:57.723 --> 10:00.893
Okay, Otto. Want a piece of your face?

10:08.108 --> 10:09.776
-Who's hungry?

10:12.654 --> 10:14.448
Look at this.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.574
No, no.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.659
Hey, hey, wait!

10:17.743 --> 10:21.288
No, no, no. Hey, you cannot use
this road without a permit.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.999
I'm not parking.
I just dropped off a package.

10:24.082 --> 10:26.877
The sign doesn't say
anything about packages, does it?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.837
It says "permits" and you don't have one.

10:28.921 --> 10:30.881
This is not a through street.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.800
Have a nice day, sir.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.260
Every time you come in here

10:35.344 --> 10:38.347
that means one of the residents
can't park in front of their homes!

10:39.473 --> 10:42.434
The other guys don't do this.
The guys with the white trucks.

10:42.518 --> 10:44.561
How come it's always you brown guys?

10:44.645 --> 10:46.605
And I don't mean that racially!

10:54.530 --> 10:55.572
Hello.

10:55.656 --> 10:58.158
Oh, hi. Sorry, can you hear me?

10:58.242 --> 10:59.117
Yes.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.202
It's Susan.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.286
Susan who?

11:01.370 --> 11:03.664
I have great news
about your health insurance.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.083
Oh, no, no, no. Robot, robot, robot!

11:09.711 --> 11:13.632
Well, who do I have to talk to
to get this phone number disconnected?

11:13.715 --> 11:14.967
That's Account Services.

11:15.050 --> 11:17.469
Can you transfer me
or should I press a number?

11:20.389 --> 11:23.642
Well, I have been listening
to that music for seven minutes.

11:23.725 --> 11:25.102
I do apologise, Mr Anderson.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.396
I would like the electricity shut off
at this residence.

11:27.479 --> 11:30.274
-Are you moving home?
-No, I am cancelling the account.

11:30.941 --> 11:33.861
A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N.

11:33.944 --> 11:36.363
And why can't you refund me
for the six days?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.240
O-T-T-O.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.324
Oh, it's policy.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.786
Well, my policy is that
if I'm going to pay for six days of gas,

11:42.870 --> 11:45.247
then I will use six days of gas.

11:45.914 --> 11:46.999
Then we are done here.

11:49.835 --> 11:50.836
Idiots.

13:06.787 --> 13:07.788
Okay.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.791
Go, go, go. Stop. Go.

13:11.625 --> 13:12.960
Okay. Yeah. Stop.

13:15.254 --> 13:18.173
Back. You're in the blind spot,
be careful. Use the Force.

13:18.257 --> 13:20.425
Good, good.
No, you're going on the sidewalk.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.219
Okay.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.596
Back, back, back.

13:24.680 --> 13:25.681
Go away.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.893
-Stop. Stop.

13:36.525 --> 13:37.484
Ah, shit.

13:37.568 --> 13:39.444
What the hell is he doing?

13:39.528 --> 13:42.281
Yes! Exactly!
That's exactly what I was saying.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.909
-Hey, you can't just drive here.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.911
I'm not driving.
Am I driving the car? No.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.247
You can't just bring a car
on this street without a permit.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.542
No, we have a parking permit.
Right here. See?

13:53.625 --> 13:55.669
What the hell's it doing in your pocket?!

13:55.752 --> 13:57.462
Well, I'm the driver.

13:58.714 --> 14:00.841
We're renting here. Yeah.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.009
In 206.

14:05.971 --> 14:09.183
That doesn't mean you can back
the trailer up to your front door.

14:09.266 --> 14:12.853
No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

14:12.936 --> 14:14.021
Parallel to what?

14:16.190 --> 14:19.359
Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

14:19.443 --> 14:21.153
I'll just give it another try.

14:21.236 --> 14:22.863
-Oh, my God.

14:25.073 --> 14:25.991
Okay.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.117
Mm...

14:30.537 --> 14:31.663
Good. Good!

14:31.747 --> 14:34.041
Keep backing away. Keep backing away.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.501
Now go away more.

14:35.584 --> 14:36.793
Okay, I got this.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.380
The other way, but first the other way.

14:40.464 --> 14:41.673
-Easy.
-Exactamente.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.717
-Easy, easy.
-Uh-huh. Good.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.719
No. No, no. What? No!

14:46.762 --> 14:49.515
-No, no, no! Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

14:49.598 --> 14:52.100
-Stop! Stop. Get outta the car.

14:52.184 --> 14:53.560
-Get outta the car.
-I'm sorry.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.270
How you could make it
this far through life

14:55.354 --> 14:57.397
without knowing how to back up a trailer.

14:57.481 --> 15:01.401
My God, a dog with one front paw and
cataracts coulda done better than that.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.820
And an automatic, of course.
Give me the keys.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.532
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.242
It's a push-button start.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.493
No, I knew that.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.331
What the hell is that?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.624
Uh, that's the radar.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.960
The trailer's too close
to the side of the car.

15:18.043 --> 15:19.837
That's why it's still beeping, but--

15:19.920 --> 15:20.963
Okay.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.424
Hello.

15:27.219 --> 15:28.053
Hello.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.596
What's your name?

15:29.680 --> 15:31.890
-Otto.
-Otto?

15:33.225 --> 15:35.769
Otto. O-T-T-O.

15:36.645 --> 15:39.106
I'm Abbie, O-T-T-O.

15:39.189 --> 15:41.817
And I'm Luna.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.444
Nice to meet you.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.006
Oh, that was good, huh?

16:04.089 --> 16:05.966
He just did it in one shot, huh?

16:08.886 --> 16:10.470
-Perfecto!
-Thank you, sir.

16:10.554 --> 16:13.724
Anyone who thinks
they need to use radar to back up a car

16:13.807 --> 16:15.309
shouldn't be allowed to drive one.

16:15.392 --> 16:17.227
They shouldn't be allowed
to use the radio.

16:17.311 --> 16:18.770
That's what I said.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.857
And the permit goes on
the rear-view mirror. Not in your pocket!

16:21.940 --> 16:23.442
-Okay, okay.
-Got it.

16:23.525 --> 16:26.862
-Bye! Thank you!
-Thank you, sir. That was very nice.

16:31.325 --> 16:32.326
Idiot.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.011
You guys all ready?

16:52.346 --> 16:53.347
Okay.

16:57.142 --> 16:58.227
All right.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.187
Bring your stuff, okay?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.105
Come on, sweeties.

17:07.778 --> 17:09.695
Chiquitita, take your stuff.

17:45.649 --> 17:47.651
How much more shelf space is left?

17:48.694 --> 17:50.153
Three shelves.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.698
-How many more boxes of books do you have?
-Seven or eight.

17:52.781 --> 17:54.700
"Then I'll build you another bookcase."

17:54.783 --> 17:57.119
Then I'll build you another bookcase.

18:13.594 --> 18:14.636
-Hi.
-Hey.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.722
Hi. Otto.

18:16.805 --> 18:18.307
Right? Yes?

18:18.390 --> 18:19.558
Otto.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.519
Yeah, that's what I said.
No? What did I say--?

18:22.603 --> 18:25.397
It doesn't matter what you said.
Otto. O-T-T-O.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.733
-Ah! Otto.
-Otto.

18:27.816 --> 18:31.278
Otto. Okay, so it's the same forward
that is backwards.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.654
-Otto.
-It's Otto, Mari.

18:32.738 --> 18:34.990
It's just you don't hear
that name very often.

18:35.073 --> 18:35.908
I do.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.203
Okay. If we're interrupting,
we can always come back.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.495
What is it you want?

18:41.413 --> 18:43.665
I brought you some food.

18:43.749 --> 18:44.750
Why?

18:46.335 --> 18:47.711
Because you looked hungry.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.588
That's why we go so well together.

18:49.671 --> 18:53.842
She loves to cook,
and I like to eat everything.

18:55.427 --> 18:57.721
Anyway, we just, uh...

18:57.804 --> 19:00.516
We wanted
to properly introduce ourselves

19:00.599 --> 19:03.060
because we're gonna be neighbours
and everything, so...

19:06.730 --> 19:07.814
-So...
-Okay.

19:07.898 --> 19:08.941
-Okay.
-Bye.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.244
My name is Marisol.

19:21.870 --> 19:22.996
And I'm Tommy.

19:25.916 --> 19:26.917
Otto.

19:29.253 --> 19:31.421
Are you always this unfriendly?

19:32.172 --> 19:33.340
I'm not unfriendly.

19:33.966 --> 19:36.218
-I'd say you're a little unfriendly.
-I'm not unfriendly.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.678
-Un poquito.
-I am not.

19:37.761 --> 19:39.221
No? Okay, you're not.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.890
No, no, no, no. You're not unfriendly.

19:42.641 --> 19:45.102
Every word you say is like a warm cuddle.

19:45.686 --> 19:46.687
It really is.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.023
Enjoy it.

19:50.899 --> 19:51.942
What is it?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.944
Be careful with the salsa, please.

19:54.027 --> 19:55.904
It's, um, pollo con mole.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.114
It's really good.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.658
It's a Mexican dish.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.618
I'm Mexican.

20:02.160 --> 20:06.081
I was born in El Salvador
because my father is from there.

20:06.164 --> 20:09.543
But my mom is Mexican,
so we went to first Mexico and then--

20:09.626 --> 20:12.796
-And you?
-I'm an IT consultant.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.676
Oh, I'm from Anaheim.

20:17.759 --> 20:18.969
Oh, from Anaheim.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.095
Anaheim, yeah.

20:20.179 --> 20:21.638
Yeah. El Paso.

20:23.182 --> 20:25.100
Okay, well, I have some things
I need to do.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.102
Excuse me, Mr Otto.

20:27.186 --> 20:30.147
You wouldn't have an Alvin wrench
I could borrow, would you?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.732
You mean an Allen wrench.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.692
No, an Alvin wrench.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.485
-It's Allen wrench.
-Allen wrench.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.654
It's "Allen" wrench, right?
It's Allen wrench.

20:37.738 --> 20:38.739
It's Alvin.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.699
All morning, "Alvin wrench, Alvin wrench."

20:40.782 --> 20:41.867
Honey, it's Alvin, trust me.

20:41.950 --> 20:43.785
Everybody else I know
calls it an Alvin wrench.

20:43.869 --> 20:46.622
-Everybody else you know is wrong.
-Oh, yeah? You wanna Google it?

20:46.705 --> 20:47.706
My God.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.333
Google it! Google it!

20:49.416 --> 20:51.627
Google it. Wikipediale. Wikipediale.

20:51.710 --> 20:52.794
Give me your phone.

20:52.878 --> 20:54.796
No, my phone. You use your phone.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.139
Do you know what size you need?

21:04.223 --> 21:06.016
Ah, just the usual size.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.603
Take the set.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.104
-Thank you.

21:11.188 --> 21:13.315
We go because you have things to do, so...

21:22.533 --> 21:24.076
What do you want, huh?

21:41.176 --> 21:42.010
Mmm.

21:42.511 --> 21:43.345
Mmm!

21:44.388 --> 21:45.264
Hm.

22:01.154 --> 22:01.989
Mmm.

22:47.492 --> 22:49.119
Isn't she beautiful, son?

22:49.703 --> 22:51.330
That's a Chevy engine for you.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.123
Dependable.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.209
Not enough you can depend on
in this world.

22:55.292 --> 22:56.543
Dad, this is Otto.

22:59.838 --> 23:01.632
That's enough now, darling.

23:21.151 --> 23:21.985
Huh.

23:22.069 --> 23:23.737
Two for $8?

23:37.376 --> 23:40.963
Maybe I should just run myself
over with a car. That'll work.

23:42.005 --> 23:44.091
Found some of the flowers you like.

23:44.675 --> 23:45.676
Pink.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.178
There was a deal on 'em.

23:49.304 --> 23:52.015
On sale. Two for 8 bucks.

23:54.268 --> 23:56.728
I'm sorry I didn't get 'em here earlier.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.356
Got distracted.

24:00.566 --> 24:02.526
By some new neighbours.

24:04.987 --> 24:06.280
Nitwit husband.

24:07.990 --> 24:10.701
Didn't even know an Allen wrench
from one of the Chipmunks.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.329
Renters, of course.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.625
No commitment to anything.

24:20.836 --> 24:25.007
I know, I know.
Maybe they can't afford to buy yet.

24:25.090 --> 24:27.926
But what will they do
when those real estate bastards

24:28.010 --> 24:30.345
decide to tear down their house

24:30.429 --> 24:33.223
and put up more
of those ricky-ticky condos, huh?

24:33.307 --> 24:35.434
It's gonna happen. I promise you.

24:35.517 --> 24:38.770
They're already driving around the gates,

24:38.854 --> 24:40.772
driving right across the grass.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.736
Dye & Merika.

24:45.819 --> 24:49.781
What idiot thought that was a good name
for a real estate company?

24:50.490 --> 24:52.242
Sounds like "dying America."

24:55.120 --> 24:57.456
It is, of course.

24:57.539 --> 25:00.334
Can't even buy
a decent screw hook anymore.

25:01.793 --> 25:03.212
Or rope by the foot.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.758
Nothing works when you're not home.

26:16.618 --> 26:17.452
Next.

26:21.748 --> 26:25.169
I suspect you have
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,

26:25.252 --> 26:27.212
which is a genetic enlargement of the--

26:27.296 --> 26:28.297
I know.

26:28.839 --> 26:30.215
My father had it.

26:32.759 --> 26:35.596
Well, you'll likely be around
a good long time,

26:35.679 --> 26:38.473
but I'm afraid
your military prospects end here.

26:40.058 --> 26:41.059
Next.

26:48.317 --> 26:50.194
One return ticket to Pittsburgh, please.

26:50.277 --> 26:51.737
That'll be 1.10.

26:54.031 --> 26:54.865
Thank you.

27:01.872 --> 27:02.873
Coming through.

27:25.562 --> 27:27.189
Hey, you dropped your book!

27:27.773 --> 27:29.733
Miss, you dropped your book! Hey!

28:17.072 --> 28:18.073
Is that mine?

28:19.074 --> 28:20.075
What?

28:21.118 --> 28:25.414
-Yes. I saw you dropped it, so I...

28:26.290 --> 28:27.833
Thank you so much.

28:27.916 --> 28:30.836
I'm halfway through reading it.
I would hate not knowing how it ends.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.133
Oh, here. Why don't you join me?

28:41.346 --> 28:42.347
I'm Sonya.

28:43.473 --> 28:44.766
I'm Otto.

28:44.850 --> 28:46.059
It was my father's name.

28:47.394 --> 28:49.688
I'm on my way
to visit my father right now.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.023
I go every Thursday.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.699
Do you take this train a lot?

29:01.450 --> 29:04.536
Oh, no, I had to come into town
for my Army physical.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.163
Oh, God.

29:07.039 --> 29:10.125
Oh, that must be so hard, not knowing
what you're gonna face over there.

29:10.834 --> 29:13.337
-When are you leaving?
-I'm not--

29:15.255 --> 29:16.256
Not for a while.

29:18.634 --> 29:19.801
Tickets, please.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.933
Thank you.

29:26.808 --> 29:27.935
All right, thank you.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.941
I'm afraid you're on the wrong train.
This is an eastbound ticket.

29:36.068 --> 29:37.569
I must have, um...

29:38.862 --> 29:40.781
I'll get off at the next station.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.074
Uh, how much is it?

29:42.950 --> 29:44.243
Uh, $1.75.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.209
One.

30:03.804 --> 30:05.848
Here. I have some change.

30:11.770 --> 30:12.938
Thank you.

30:17.109 --> 30:19.319
There you go. Thank you. Have a good day.

30:24.908 --> 30:26.159
A quarter to spare.

30:27.661 --> 30:29.162
It's 1964.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.164
-It's pure silver.
-Oh?

30:31.248 --> 30:33.292
Keep it, then. It's lucky.

30:38.130 --> 30:39.339
Yes, it is.

31:26.845 --> 31:30.224
Hey, Otto! A little late
for your morning rounds, isn't it?

31:30.307 --> 31:31.183
No.

31:31.266 --> 31:33.018
No? Aren't you supposed to be at work?

31:35.229 --> 31:36.104
No.

31:36.188 --> 31:38.440
Oh. Cool.
You wanna come over for lunch, then?

31:38.524 --> 31:41.276
-Lunch.

31:42.110 --> 31:42.945
Yeah.

31:43.028 --> 31:44.613
No, no.

31:44.696 --> 31:47.574
Well, it's pork tenderloin,
in case you change your mind!

31:47.658 --> 31:49.159
No, no, no, no.

31:50.160 --> 31:51.370
Hey, excuse me.

31:53.956 --> 31:55.123
It was you.

31:55.624 --> 31:59.920
This is a private road, and these gates
are to keep down the flow of traffic.

32:00.003 --> 32:03.549
Not so idiot drivers can go around them
and tear up the grass.

32:03.632 --> 32:06.844
-Okay. You got me. I'm with Dye & Merika.

32:06.927 --> 32:10.597
I'm gonna have the groundskeeper
come down and fix that up for ya, okay?

32:10.681 --> 32:13.725
Good as new. Even better.
You have a good one now, okay?

32:13.809 --> 32:15.602
The rules are here for a reason.

32:20.649 --> 32:22.150
I know what you guys are up to.

32:22.234 --> 32:24.444
Okay, Mr Anderson. Whatever you say.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.822
Keep up the neighbourhood watch.

32:29.324 --> 32:33.078
-Get out here, you little bugger!

32:34.121 --> 32:35.539
Come on. Yeah.

32:35.622 --> 32:36.623
Get out here!

32:37.291 --> 32:38.750
You throw one more rock,

32:38.834 --> 32:41.628
and I swear I'll dropkick that little
rat dog of yours right over the roof.

32:41.712 --> 32:45.382
No, I'm not throwing it at your house.
That nasty cat scratched Prince.

32:45.465 --> 32:46.633
I'm gonna kill that piece of shit.

32:46.717 --> 32:47.843
No, you're not.

32:47.926 --> 32:49.678
What do you care? It's feral.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.222
It's probably full of all sorts
of disgusting diseases.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.683
So are you, most likely.
I don't throw rocks at you.

32:55.767 --> 32:56.602
Andy.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.521
-What's up?
-Did you hear what he just said this time?

32:59.605 --> 33:01.440
I told you before about
how he talks to me.

33:01.523 --> 33:03.525
Get outta here while you can.

33:03.609 --> 33:04.818
I'm not your friend.

33:04.902 --> 33:07.571
Dye & Merika said they'll get all
the old people on this street into a home.

33:07.654 --> 33:08.989
The sooner the better!

33:26.965 --> 33:29.468
-Hello.
-What now?

33:29.551 --> 33:31.595
I just wanted to bring the wrenches back.

33:31.678 --> 33:34.640
-I found one that came with the furniture.
-Congratulations.

33:35.224 --> 33:37.476
And I made you some salpores de arroz.

33:37.559 --> 33:39.394
Is that chicken and mole?

33:39.478 --> 33:43.941
No. These are Salvadoran cookies.
They were my father's favourite, so...

33:44.024 --> 33:45.817
They're delicious.
You're gonna love 'em.

33:45.901 --> 33:47.277
Yes, because I made them.

33:47.361 --> 33:50.531
Also, Otto, I was wondering
if you have a ladder I can borrow.

33:50.614 --> 33:51.949
Our window is jammed.

33:52.032 --> 33:53.575
Why do you need a ladder?

33:53.659 --> 33:55.827
Well, it's the one up there.

33:57.079 --> 33:58.372
It won't open.

33:58.455 --> 34:00.958
And you're gonna try to open it
from the outside?

34:01.041 --> 34:02.292
Yeah. Right.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.045
I'll get my coat.

34:05.128 --> 34:06.547
Okay. Thank you.

34:08.841 --> 34:10.342
I like how his hands are waving.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.135
Let's put the arm in.

34:14.679 --> 34:15.556
-Good.
-Anita.

34:15.639 --> 34:20.185
Uh, Otto, hate to bother you,
but, um, we don't have any heat.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.728
Could you come take a look?

34:22.813 --> 34:24.231
Try bleeding your radiators.

34:25.232 --> 34:27.650
How would I go about that?

34:27.734 --> 34:30.027
By bleeding the radiators.

34:30.112 --> 34:32.030
Otto. Don't be rude.

34:32.114 --> 34:33.739
I wasn't being rude.

34:34.449 --> 34:38.328
Well, it's hard to tell the difference
sometimes with Otto.

34:38.411 --> 34:39.413
Yeah.

34:40.371 --> 34:43.667
By the way, we, uh, just moved to 206.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.960
-I'm Marisol.
-I'm Tommy.

34:46.043 --> 34:48.130
-Welcome, honey.
-Nice meeting you.

34:48.213 --> 34:49.297
I'm Anita.

34:49.380 --> 34:52.342
My husband, Reuben,
is the one who used to handle the heat.

34:52.426 --> 34:54.678
-Okay.
-But we always knew a day would come

34:54.761 --> 34:58.557
when he wouldn't be able to handle things
around the house any longer.

34:59.808 --> 35:03.312
Maybe Reuben should have thought of that
when he organised his coup.

35:03.395 --> 35:04.354
Oh...

35:04.438 --> 35:07.024
That was a long time ago.

35:07.107 --> 35:08.275
A coup?

35:08.358 --> 35:10.360
It was a misunderstanding.

35:10.444 --> 35:11.528
It was a coup.

35:14.156 --> 35:18.660
Otto, can't you just go
breathe Anita's radiators for her?

35:18.744 --> 35:21.538
No. Because you don't breathe radiators.

35:21.622 --> 35:22.664
You bleed them.

35:22.748 --> 35:24.750
-Honey, look at this ramp.
-That's Sonya's.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.960
-This is what we needed for the trailer.
-Put that down.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.838
Put that down!
Who said you could touch that?!

35:29.922 --> 35:32.174
-Sorry.
-All of you get outta here. Go, go.

35:32.257 --> 35:35.093
Take your ladder and go.
Get outta here. All of you.

35:35.177 --> 35:36.553
-Okay.
-Thank you.

35:37.888 --> 35:38.931
Watch out.

35:39.014 --> 35:41.683
-Right. Right.

35:45.437 --> 35:46.813
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

35:52.486 --> 35:55.155
No. What are you doing in here?

35:55.239 --> 35:57.115
How did you get in here? Come on.

35:57.199 --> 35:59.618
Come on. Go! Get outta there.

36:01.203 --> 36:03.747
No, get out. Get out of there.

36:03.830 --> 36:04.831
Come on, go.

36:07.793 --> 36:08.627
-Hey.

36:12.130 --> 36:13.507
Let go!

36:14.258 --> 36:15.384
-Let go.

36:18.762 --> 36:21.557
You scratch me, I'll bite you.

36:24.852 --> 36:26.937
-That'll teach you.

36:30.399 --> 36:31.608
Stupid cat.

36:36.613 --> 36:38.699
-Hi, Otto!

36:38.782 --> 36:40.450
-O-T-T-O.

36:41.326 --> 36:42.286
Hm.

36:58.302 --> 37:00.220
Otto. Um...

37:00.304 --> 37:01.889
I loaned you my garden hose last August.

37:01.972 --> 37:05.058
If you give it back to me,
I'll bleed your radiators for you.

37:06.810 --> 37:07.853
Come in.

37:15.319 --> 37:19.990
So those new neighbours of yours,
they seem quite lovely, don't you think?

37:20.866 --> 37:21.867
Lovely.

37:22.576 --> 37:26.622
Yeah, well, you may have
some more new neighbours soon enough.

37:27.831 --> 37:30.125
The realty people,
they've been telling us...

37:30.959 --> 37:33.462
Reuben and I have to move out.

37:34.254 --> 37:35.506
No, that's a load of crap.

37:36.632 --> 37:38.300
They don't own this house. You do.

37:38.383 --> 37:40.052
Yeah, well, that's what I said.

37:40.761 --> 37:43.597
They, uh, have been
talking to our boy, Chris.

37:43.680 --> 37:44.515
Oh.

37:44.598 --> 37:47.809
Now he's saying that I can
no longer take care of Reuben,

37:47.893 --> 37:51.021
that he needs to be
in a special care place.

37:51.104 --> 37:54.858
And I should move into a retirement home.

37:54.942 --> 37:57.986
What does Chris know about it?
He's an idiot. He always has been.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.988
They can't make you do anything.

38:03.367 --> 38:05.077
Does he even know we're here?

38:05.827 --> 38:07.079
Of course he does.

38:07.162 --> 38:08.956
Don't let him fool you.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.083
He's still in there.

38:13.377 --> 38:14.419
Um...

38:15.003 --> 38:17.005
Let me go find your hose.

38:35.816 --> 38:38.402
The whole neighbourhood
is falling apart these days.

38:39.903 --> 38:42.656
They don't even have
a homeowners' association anymore.

38:44.032 --> 38:47.160
No one left to keep things running.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.372
Not like we did.

38:57.421 --> 38:58.881
Now, just to be clear...

39:00.132 --> 39:01.675
I still haven't forgiven you.

39:03.177 --> 39:06.430
I just didn't realise
you would fall to shit so quickly.

39:07.681 --> 39:08.724
Now...

39:10.559 --> 39:13.520
they're tearing apart
everything we worked so hard to build.

39:15.147 --> 39:17.900
I haven't even left yet,
and they're trying to erase us.

39:20.110 --> 39:24.364
Well, I am not staying around
to see that happen.

39:25.282 --> 39:26.533
I'm leaving.

39:27.993 --> 39:30.287
-For good.
-You ready for lunch?

39:30.370 --> 39:32.122
I'm making that creamed corn you like.

39:32.206 --> 39:33.207
Oh, thank you.

39:33.999 --> 39:36.960
Thank you, Otto.
I'm sorry it took so long to give it back.

39:37.044 --> 39:38.420
Um, you wanna stay for lunch?

39:38.504 --> 39:40.297
Yeah, Anita made a pork tenderloin.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.549
No, I have a lot of things I have to do.

39:45.886 --> 39:47.179
Reuben, what are you doing, hon?

39:49.097 --> 39:50.349
-Let go.
-What are you doing?

39:51.183 --> 39:54.353
-Let go.
-Reuben. Reuben.

39:54.436 --> 39:56.438
-Let...
-What are you doing?

39:56.522 --> 39:57.356
...go.

40:09.159 --> 40:10.160
Oh, man.

40:31.849 --> 40:33.767
Try opening it from the inside a little.

40:36.061 --> 40:37.563
It's higher than I thought.

40:38.605 --> 40:40.232
I'm a little bit dizzy, honey.

41:20.606 --> 41:21.440

42:56.577 --> 42:58.912
Did you have to go back
to the military centre?

42:58.996 --> 43:01.790
No, I wanted to pay you back

43:41.580 --> 43:42.956
What are you passionate about?

43:43.916 --> 43:46.001
Machines. Engines.

43:46.084 --> 43:47.503
I like knowing how things work.

43:47.586 --> 43:48.837
I like knowing how things work.

43:48.921 --> 43:51.673
What each part does
to make a car run smoothly.

43:51.757 --> 43:53.592
It's more complicated than people realise.

43:53.675 --> 43:56.678
A carburettor has to mix gas and air
in just the right combination,

43:56.762 --> 43:58.931
and then the spark plug
has to ignite that mixture,

43:59.014 --> 44:00.390
which drives the piston

44:00.474 --> 44:01.850
and the connecting rods
and the drive shaft--

44:01.934 --> 44:04.520
Where did you learn so much about cars?

44:04.603 --> 44:06.021
From my father.

44:06.688 --> 44:09.358
It's all we really talked about.
He was a good dad.

44:10.734 --> 44:11.735
Dependable.

44:13.111 --> 44:14.571
He passed away.

44:15.781 --> 44:16.782
Two months ago.

44:19.117 --> 44:20.369
It was sudden.

44:20.953 --> 44:21.954
I'm sorry.

44:24.915 --> 44:25.749
And your mom?

44:26.458 --> 44:28.293
Don't remember her much.

44:28.377 --> 44:31.463
Just how it felt when she was gone.

44:39.888 --> 44:41.431
Why didn't you get an entrée?

44:46.687 --> 44:47.896
I ate at home.

44:49.982 --> 44:50.816
Why?

44:52.860 --> 44:54.403
So you could order whatever you wanted.

45:01.159 --> 45:02.995
Look, I lied to you.

45:03.662 --> 45:04.913
I'm sorry.

45:06.456 --> 45:08.792
I'm not in the Army.
I couldn't pass my physical.

45:08.876 --> 45:12.296
If I had, at least I'd have a job now,
which is what I was counting on.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.131
But I don't.

45:16.842 --> 45:18.927
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

45:20.888 --> 45:21.889
I should go.

45:39.948 --> 45:41.283
Otto!

45:48.373 --> 45:49.458
Otto!

45:52.503 --> 45:53.504
I'm coming.

45:54.087 --> 45:55.088
I'm coming!

45:55.881 --> 45:57.841
What? What do you want?

45:57.925 --> 46:00.052
-What are you doing here?
-What are you doing?

46:00.135 --> 46:02.054
-I'm looking for you.
-Well, you found me.

46:02.679 --> 46:04.681
Can you please take me
to the hospital? Please?

46:04.765 --> 46:07.434
Tommy fell off the ladder,
and the ambulance just took him away.

46:07.518 --> 46:11.480
Well, you can drive yourself
in that imported toaster you call a car.

46:11.563 --> 46:13.232
I don't have a licence.

46:13.315 --> 46:15.943
-How old are you?
-Huh? Thirty.

46:16.026 --> 46:17.945
And you don't have a driver's licence?

46:18.028 --> 46:20.155
I have a driving's permit.

46:20.239 --> 46:22.574
I just never got to the other parts.

46:22.658 --> 46:24.576
How many other parts are there?

46:27.746 --> 46:28.747
Please!

46:30.707 --> 46:33.585
Focus! Please, listen!

46:34.878 --> 46:39.091
Tommy is in the hospital,
and he may be dying as we speak.

46:39.174 --> 46:42.678
So are you gonna drive me to the hospital,
or are you gonna make me take a bus?

46:42.761 --> 46:44.805
-I will drive you to the hospital.
-Thank you.

46:45.556 --> 46:46.807
Was it so hard?

46:48.517 --> 46:49.518
Where are you going?

46:50.227 --> 46:52.312
I'm going to get the children!

46:53.772 --> 46:55.148
The children?

47:00.779 --> 47:02.155
Pick me up, pick me up!

47:13.166 --> 47:15.335
Bam everywhere. No! No!

47:20.215 --> 47:21.508
Smack, smack, smack!

47:21.592 --> 47:22.593
These dolls.

47:23.594 --> 47:26.221
Are they some kind of superheroes?

47:26.305 --> 47:28.307
Um, Luchador are wrestlers. Yeah.

47:29.349 --> 47:30.434
Wrestlers.

47:30.517 --> 47:32.811
-I found a Mr Bear book!
-So I see.

47:34.396 --> 47:36.440
She wants you to read to her.

47:37.733 --> 47:38.734
Exactly.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.030
"Are You There, Baby Bear?

47:45.532 --> 47:49.161
'Are you there, Baby Bear?'
Mr Bear says.

47:49.244 --> 47:51.747
'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear.'"

47:51.830 --> 47:53.749
No, talk like a bear.

47:55.626 --> 47:57.419
Bears don't talk.

47:57.503 --> 47:58.879
Um, this one does.

48:04.301 --> 48:07.429
"'Where, oh where, is my Baby Bear?'

48:08.805 --> 48:13.352
'Are you there, Baby Bear,
up in that tree?'"

48:13.435 --> 48:15.354
-No, it's an owl!

48:18.023 --> 48:23.278
"'There's nobody here but baby and me.'

48:28.158 --> 48:31.203
'Are you there, Baby Bear,
deep underground?'"

48:31.286 --> 48:33.080
I'm no Baby Bear.

48:33.163 --> 48:34.665
I'm Beppo!

48:34.748 --> 48:36.208
-Hi, Beppo!

48:36.291 --> 48:38.126
-Do you want to see a trick?
-Yes!

48:38.210 --> 48:40.754
Actually, I was reading to them.

48:40.838 --> 48:46.134
"Actually, I was reading to them,"
Mr Bear grumbled.

48:46.218 --> 48:48.262
Say, could I borrow a coin, Mr Bear?

48:48.345 --> 48:50.180
Yes, yes, yes, please?

48:50.264 --> 48:52.182
Please, please, please?

48:53.433 --> 48:55.060
-Yes, yes, yes!

48:56.895 --> 48:57.938
I need this back.

48:58.021 --> 48:59.523
Absolutely.

49:17.207 --> 49:19.835
He doesn't even own the costume.
That's owned by the hospital.

49:19.918 --> 49:21.420
He's gonna have to pay for that.

49:21.503 --> 49:25.382
Beppo means happiness.
He volunteers his time to be here.

49:25.465 --> 49:28.218
Otto. What the hell did you do?

49:28.302 --> 49:29.303
Nothing.

49:29.386 --> 49:31.889
Abuelo Otto hit the clown.

49:31.972 --> 49:33.849
-I did not.
-Yeah, you did.

49:33.932 --> 49:35.642
Abuelo Luchadoro!

49:36.226 --> 49:38.061
Luchadoro!

49:38.145 --> 49:39.897
It was all the clown's fault.

49:40.606 --> 49:41.732
Ooh!

49:41.815 --> 49:44.526
Where is it going?

49:45.903 --> 49:48.322
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

49:48.989 --> 49:50.282
Here you go.

49:50.365 --> 49:51.491
Blow.

49:56.997 --> 49:59.291
Wow! Here it is!

49:59.374 --> 50:01.376
-How'd you do that?
-Oh, it's magic.

50:01.460 --> 50:03.128
-Thank you.

50:03.212 --> 50:05.255
I hope you have a magical day!

50:05.339 --> 50:06.757
-Bye!
-Bye, Beppo!

50:06.840 --> 50:08.717
-Thank you.
-Hang on.

50:11.386 --> 50:12.930
This isn't my quarter.

50:13.514 --> 50:16.391
Well, it came from your ear, sir,
so that's a you problem.

50:17.559 --> 50:19.061
No, this isn't my quarter.

50:19.144 --> 50:21.605
"No, no, no. This is not your quarter."

50:23.315 --> 50:26.777
Look. I gave you a quarter
that I said I needed back.

50:26.860 --> 50:29.071
-You want a dollar?
-And you switched them on me.

50:29.154 --> 50:30.822
-The ol' switcheroo.
-You gave me this quarter.

50:30.906 --> 50:32.491
Is Otto going to get in trouble?

50:32.574 --> 50:34.284
-It's just a quarter.
-No, it's not.

50:34.368 --> 50:36.703
-Do you see the copper?
-He's not calling the coppers.

50:36.787 --> 50:38.705
-I gave you a 1964 quarter.
-Please calm down.

50:38.789 --> 50:40.207
I want it back! Where is it?

50:40.290 --> 50:42.167
-You have it on you.
-Officer, help me.

50:42.251 --> 50:44.127
129. We have a clown situation.

50:44.211 --> 50:45.212
Where is it?

50:45.295 --> 50:46.713
Let go of the clown! Sir! Sir!

50:46.797 --> 50:48.799
A-ha! 1964.

50:56.682 --> 50:58.183
Where's my toy?

50:58.267 --> 50:59.726
It's in your backpack.

50:59.810 --> 51:02.312
What pocket? There's a million pockets.

51:03.605 --> 51:04.606
What?

51:07.025 --> 51:08.819
My father used to smile like that.

51:10.445 --> 51:11.697
I'm not smiling.

51:12.364 --> 51:13.198
Exactly.

51:13.824 --> 51:15.993
You should never be mean to a clown.

51:16.076 --> 51:18.203
-What about Alvin Wrench, is he coming?
-Look!

51:18.287 --> 51:19.788
-Hey, guys!
-Mom, there he is!

51:20.956 --> 51:23.083
Pull the car up please, so we pick him up.

51:23.166 --> 51:24.168
Otto!

51:28.088 --> 51:30.174
-Yay! Yay!
-Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

51:30.257 --> 51:32.718
-Thanks for driving us.
-Bye, Abuelo Luchadoro.

51:32.801 --> 51:34.553
-Thank you, Otto.
-Okay, good night.

51:34.636 --> 51:36.305
-Bye!
-Thanks again, Otto.

51:37.222 --> 51:38.223
Bye, then.

51:38.307 --> 51:39.766
All right, ladies.

51:39.850 --> 51:40.851
Let's go.

51:42.144 --> 51:45.772
Look at your new leg!
They look like a robot leg.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.087
Otto!

52:12.049 --> 52:13.675
Oh, my God, is he dead?

52:13.759 --> 52:15.802
No, he's probably sleeping.

52:15.886 --> 52:19.181
Otto. No, no, no, please.
Please. Please. Take him out. Please.

52:19.264 --> 52:21.141
No, why can't you?

52:21.225 --> 52:25.270
Because I'm pregnant. I cannot handle
the cats because I can get the toxo thing.

52:25.354 --> 52:28.732
Well, he got himself in there.
He can get himself out of there.

52:28.815 --> 52:30.817
Ay.

52:30.901 --> 52:32.277
Why are you like that?

52:32.361 --> 52:33.695
I'm not good with cats.

52:33.779 --> 52:35.405
Hey, man. What's going on?

52:35.489 --> 52:37.741
Jimmy. Jimmy. We have a...

52:37.824 --> 52:40.160
Oh, no!

52:40.244 --> 52:41.912
We gotta warm you up, buddy!

52:41.995 --> 52:43.497
Oh, yeah. Oh, be careful.

52:43.580 --> 52:44.915
Oh, no.

52:44.998 --> 52:46.416
-Oh, I've got you.

52:46.500 --> 52:48.085
He's so cold.

52:48.168 --> 52:49.503
Where do we go?

52:49.586 --> 52:52.339
-No. But no. Toxo. Otto.
-Oh.

52:52.422 --> 52:55.133
Okay, let's go. I've got you now.

52:55.217 --> 52:56.677
Otto. Open the door.

52:56.760 --> 52:58.303
Oh, it's all right, buddy.

52:58.387 --> 53:00.472
-It's gonna be okay, chiquitito.
-Poor guy.

53:02.850 --> 53:04.309
Okay. You're okay.

53:04.393 --> 53:06.478
-Snow all over my floor.
-Oh, sorry.

53:06.562 --> 53:09.815
Oh, my God, it's so freezing here.

53:09.898 --> 53:12.109
Okay, how about this one? Please?

53:12.192 --> 53:14.695
No, no. Don't touch that coat.
It'll stay here.

53:14.778 --> 53:18.073
-Okay. Can you please bring a blanket?
-For the cat?

53:18.156 --> 53:20.993
-It's okay. I got this.
-What are you doing?

53:21.743 --> 53:25.497
Oh, body heat works wonders.
I've got plenty of body and heat.

53:25.581 --> 53:27.249
I'm gonna turn on the oven.

53:27.332 --> 53:29.751
You are not putting that cat in my oven.

53:29.835 --> 53:32.796
No, I'm just trying to get
some heat in the house.

53:38.010 --> 53:41.054
Your counters are so low.
Where did you get them?

53:41.847 --> 53:43.307
I built them.

53:43.390 --> 53:45.309
For Sonya. For my wife.

53:46.226 --> 53:48.103
Ah. Is she short too?

53:49.062 --> 53:50.314
Sonya passed away.

53:52.441 --> 53:54.526
She was a great cook though,
wasn't she?

53:55.694 --> 53:57.321
I used to eat here all the time.

53:58.739 --> 53:59.573
Oh.

54:00.824 --> 54:01.950
I'm sorry.

54:03.660 --> 54:05.370
Well, can you go now?

54:05.454 --> 54:07.080
I have things to do.

54:08.498 --> 54:11.335
Well, it was great seeing ya, as usual.

54:12.085 --> 54:14.630
Oh, hey, who's gonna look after this guy?

54:14.713 --> 54:15.964
You are.

54:16.048 --> 54:17.591
-Aw.

54:18.675 --> 54:19.676
Okay.

54:27.726 --> 54:29.520
Now ask me the right way.

54:35.734 --> 54:37.486
It was so beautiful too.

54:38.320 --> 54:40.531
Okay, now I'm hungry. Now I'm hungry.

54:47.079 --> 54:48.080
Let's see.

54:51.458 --> 54:54.419
"The Board of Regents hereby certifies
that Otto Anderson,

54:54.503 --> 54:58.298
having completed all the requirements
for a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering--"

54:58.382 --> 54:59.842
Would you ever wanna...

55:01.051 --> 55:02.094
get married?

55:04.012 --> 55:05.722
-'Cause if you did...
-Look at me.

55:09.059 --> 55:10.394
Now ask me the right way.

55:13.689 --> 55:14.731
Will you...?

55:19.611 --> 55:20.696
Will you marry me?

55:20.779 --> 55:21.905
Yes.

55:21.989 --> 55:23.323
Yes!

55:23.407 --> 55:25.742
-Yes.

55:27.286 --> 55:28.120
Yes.

55:33.625 --> 55:36.003
-Yes! Yes!

56:30.349 --> 56:32.267
-Oh, my God!
-Someone call 911.

56:35.145 --> 56:36.230
He fell down!

56:36.313 --> 56:38.982
-Somebody help him!
-Get the camera on him. No, take video.

56:39.066 --> 56:40.192
Oh, for God's sake.

56:40.275 --> 56:42.986
-Who's gonna do something?
-Oh, my God, he fell.

56:43.070 --> 56:46.073
-Get him off the tracks. Somebody help.
-Hey! Can you move?

56:47.741 --> 56:49.826
You gotta move! Come on! You gotta get up!

56:50.744 --> 56:52.788
Will somebody help me?

56:54.706 --> 56:57.584
-Come on.
-Film it, film it, film it.

56:58.544 --> 57:00.879
-Get the shot.
-I have him. I see him.

57:03.006 --> 57:04.007
Zoom in on his face.

57:04.091 --> 57:06.426
-Tell me what happened.
-We were going to the museum...

57:18.438 --> 57:19.898
Look at me.

57:19.982 --> 57:20.983
Say hello.

57:21.066 --> 57:22.568
Take a breath, Otto.

57:25.237 --> 57:26.822
Take my hand.

57:26.905 --> 57:27.781
Take my hand.

57:28.991 --> 57:30.659
Take my hand now!

57:40.252 --> 57:43.338
Hey, are you out of your mind?
You could have been killed.

57:43.422 --> 57:44.882
Sir, you saved his life.

57:44.965 --> 57:46.341
He saved that guy's life.

57:46.425 --> 57:48.719
You're amazing. Oh, my God.

57:48.802 --> 57:50.053
That was amazing.

57:57.186 --> 57:59.563
-Whatever. Follow us.
-Anyway, follow us.

58:18.165 --> 58:18.999
Hey.

58:23.587 --> 58:25.214
Are you trying to scare me to death?

58:25.964 --> 58:26.965
Look at this.

58:27.799 --> 58:28.675
Um...

58:28.759 --> 58:32.054
Abbie wanted to make a picture
of her new neighbour.

58:32.137 --> 58:33.555
She wants you to have that.

58:33.639 --> 58:35.933
That's you.

58:36.433 --> 58:37.935
She always draws you in colour.

58:39.228 --> 58:40.354
What do you mean, "always"?

58:40.979 --> 58:41.813
Hm!

58:42.397 --> 58:43.607
I have a very good idea.

58:44.274 --> 58:46.109
You can be my driver's instructor.

58:47.528 --> 58:48.362
No.

58:49.112 --> 58:50.280
No, no, no.

58:50.364 --> 58:52.449
I don't have time for that.

58:53.408 --> 58:56.036
But don't worry,
I'll pay for the gas and everything.

58:56.995 --> 59:00.749
Hey, there you guys are.
I've been looking for ya everywhere.

59:00.832 --> 59:02.543
-Hi, Jimmy. What are you doing?

59:02.626 --> 59:04.044
-Cat in there?
-Yeah.

59:04.127 --> 59:06.255
-Oh, jeez! Calm down, dude.

59:06.338 --> 59:08.423
-He really doesn't like this.

59:08.507 --> 59:10.175
Let him out of the box.

59:10.801 --> 59:13.053
Okay. Sorry, buddy.

59:15.889 --> 59:19.184
What do you think you were doing?
Taking him for a walk?

59:19.268 --> 59:22.396
Well, I had to bring him back.
I forgot that I'm allergic.

59:22.479 --> 59:23.480
-So...

59:23.564 --> 59:25.357
-Oh, Jimmy.
-Yeah. Yeah.

59:25.941 --> 59:28.527
I put oatmeal on it,
and it didn't help at all.

59:28.610 --> 59:32.906
You know what, you come with me.
Tommy has a prescription from last year.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.117
-He found a wasp's nest.
-Are you sure?

59:35.200 --> 59:36.702
-I don't want to be a bother.
-It's okay.

59:36.785 --> 59:38.787
-Don't scratch.
-I feel like I should scratch a little.

59:38.871 --> 59:40.330
Hey, hey, what about the cat?

59:41.164 --> 59:43.208
Uh, looks like he's yours now, Otto.

59:43.876 --> 59:44.877
Love him.

1:00:00.350 --> 1:00:01.768
-Get in the box.

1:00:04.396 --> 1:00:05.480
Get in the box.

1:00:10.736 --> 1:00:11.737
Get in the box.

1:00:22.164 --> 1:00:24.166
Sorry I haven't come yet.

1:00:28.045 --> 1:00:30.255
It's been harder than I thought to...

1:00:36.595 --> 1:00:38.180
And now he's moved in.

1:00:43.769 --> 1:00:44.978
I have a cat.

1:00:47.940 --> 1:00:50.359
I have to figure out what to do with him.

1:00:52.402 --> 1:00:54.821
Then I'll come to you, Sonya. I promise.

1:00:57.366 --> 1:00:58.367
I miss you.

1:01:02.371 --> 1:01:06.333
♪ And I finally see ♪

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:09.962
♪ How your love is the best of me ♪

1:01:11.129 --> 1:01:14.883
♪ Yeah, there's so much
I want you to know ♪

1:01:17.261 --> 1:01:21.431
♪ Yeah, there's so much
I want you to know ♪

1:01:24.810 --> 1:01:27.271
♪ Guess I'll wait till you're home ♪

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:29.898
Oh, no, no, no.

1:01:29.982 --> 1:01:32.234
You are not taking over my bed.

1:01:32.818 --> 1:01:35.112
This is your bed.

1:01:36.196 --> 1:01:38.365
Would you rather sleep outside,

1:01:39.032 --> 1:01:40.367
back in the snow?

1:01:40.450 --> 1:01:41.702
That can be arranged.

1:01:52.171 --> 1:01:55.424
You'll be the best dad
our children could ever hope for.

1:02:30.292 --> 1:02:31.585
Hey! Hey!

1:02:31.668 --> 1:02:32.753
What?

1:02:32.836 --> 1:02:35.005
Is this what you use that bike for?

1:02:35.088 --> 1:02:36.632
Yeah. It's my job.

1:02:36.715 --> 1:02:39.092
Waiting tables and pumping gas,
that's a job.

1:02:39.176 --> 1:02:43.013
I also work nights at a pizza shop
and weekends at a thrift store, so...

1:02:43.597 --> 1:02:44.431
Oh.

1:02:45.098 --> 1:02:48.060
-Huh.
-You're Mr Anderson, aren't you?

1:02:48.644 --> 1:02:49.478
Mm-hm.

1:02:49.561 --> 1:02:51.438
You used to come
to presentations at school.

1:02:52.731 --> 1:02:53.899
When was that?

1:02:54.483 --> 1:02:55.943
Mrs Anderson was my teacher.

1:02:58.278 --> 1:03:01.114
She was the first person
that didn't treat me like a freak

1:03:01.198 --> 1:03:02.574
'cause I'm transgender.

1:03:05.118 --> 1:03:07.162
She was the first
to call me by my new name.

1:03:08.247 --> 1:03:10.499
She got the other teachers to do it too.

1:03:12.751 --> 1:03:14.002
It really helped me at school.

1:03:15.963 --> 1:03:17.422
I won't leave these here anymore.

1:03:20.008 --> 1:03:20.843
Hey.

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:24.221
What's your name?

1:03:25.097 --> 1:03:26.640
-Malcolm.

1:03:27.224 --> 1:03:28.392
Otto.

1:03:28.475 --> 1:03:29.852
Nice to meet you, Otto.

1:03:36.525 --> 1:03:37.442
Hey!

1:03:39.361 --> 1:03:41.321
Otto! Good news.

1:03:41.405 --> 1:03:43.365
Andy's teaching me how to drive.

1:03:43.448 --> 1:03:44.533
The wrong way.

1:03:45.909 --> 1:03:47.369
-Thank you.
-Of course.

1:03:48.370 --> 1:03:49.872
-All right.
-Okay.

1:03:49.955 --> 1:03:51.248
-Bye.

1:03:51.331 --> 1:03:52.624
Park!

1:03:52.708 --> 1:03:55.377
You're still in drive! It's an automatic.

1:03:55.460 --> 1:03:58.380
You were still in drive.
You gotta put it into park.

1:03:58.463 --> 1:03:59.298
In what?

1:04:02.217 --> 1:04:03.218
Bye!

1:04:04.261 --> 1:04:05.137
Mm.

1:04:07.848 --> 1:04:09.183
-Help!
-I'm coming!

1:04:11.810 --> 1:04:13.854
Saving the princess!

1:04:13.937 --> 1:04:16.106
-All right. Coming!
-Otto!

1:04:16.732 --> 1:04:19.484
Otto's here!
My mom made her salpores.

1:04:19.568 --> 1:04:21.195
Hey, Otto. Come in.

1:04:21.278 --> 1:04:24.072
I can't stand watching
one idiot teach another how to drive.

1:04:24.156 --> 1:04:27.159
You. Put on your coat. It's lesson time.

1:04:27.242 --> 1:04:28.243
What?

1:04:29.536 --> 1:04:31.830
You're gonna teach me? Really?

1:04:31.914 --> 1:04:34.082
Otto, thank you!

1:04:34.708 --> 1:04:36.752
-Mm.
-Thank you.

1:04:38.795 --> 1:04:40.088
I'll be right out!

1:04:40.172 --> 1:04:42.925
That's really, really nice of you, Otto.
Thank you.

1:04:43.008 --> 1:04:44.134
Mm.

1:04:44.635 --> 1:04:45.802
I tried once.

1:04:45.886 --> 1:04:47.054
Mm.

1:04:47.137 --> 1:04:48.472
You guys, okay.

1:04:48.555 --> 1:04:49.556
Bye, Otto!

1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:53.143
-Mama's going on a ride.
-Be careful, honey.

1:04:53.227 --> 1:04:54.728
-Bye, Mama!
-Bye, mi vida.

1:04:54.811 --> 1:04:56.980
-Have fun, guys!

1:04:57.064 --> 1:04:57.940
Bye, Mama!

1:04:58.023 --> 1:04:59.024
All right.

1:05:00.442 --> 1:05:02.569
-No more grown-ups. Come on!
-Yay!

1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:07.032
Ah. Otto, pero can we go in our car?

1:05:07.115 --> 1:05:09.535
Because I've only ever driven automatic.

1:05:09.618 --> 1:05:10.577
No.

1:05:10.661 --> 1:05:13.664
I'm teaching you how to drive. Get in.

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:21.463
Now, coming up on the red light.
You're going to have to stop.

1:05:21.547 --> 1:05:23.382
Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

1:05:23.465 --> 1:05:26.301
You get the clutch
and then press in on the brake.

1:05:26.385 --> 1:05:29.471
-Do I hit the brake or the clutch?
-No, keep the clutch in.

1:05:29.555 --> 1:05:31.473
Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

1:05:31.557 --> 1:05:33.475
Clutch and brake. And now brake.

1:05:33.559 --> 1:05:35.394
-Brake. Brake.
-No. No.

1:05:36.520 --> 1:05:38.981
-Don't shout at me.
-I am not shouting at you.

1:05:39.064 --> 1:05:40.274
Clutch in. It's in, it's in!

1:05:40.357 --> 1:05:42.234
We're going to stop, and...

1:05:42.317 --> 1:05:45.654
Clutch in, and brake.
Brake. Brake. Brake.

1:05:45.737 --> 1:05:48.615
The car is stopped.
Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

1:05:49.199 --> 1:05:50.784
Yes. All right, let go.

1:05:51.660 --> 1:05:53.370
Oh, my God.

1:05:53.453 --> 1:05:54.454
Brake.

1:05:55.122 --> 1:05:56.415
It's clutch and brake.

1:05:56.999 --> 1:05:58.584
I suck at this.

1:05:58.667 --> 1:06:00.544
-I suck.
-You're learning.

1:06:02.171 --> 1:06:04.965
Oh, my God, I almost hit the car.
It's like this.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:07.092
It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

1:06:07.176 --> 1:06:08.385
It's a hybrid, okay.

1:06:09.011 --> 1:06:11.430
-Okay, I should move back.
-No, no, no. No.

1:06:11.513 --> 1:06:13.765
-You're fine right where you are.
-But I'm very close.

1:06:13.849 --> 1:06:15.934
-Doesn't matter.
-I don't need to go back?

1:06:16.018 --> 1:06:18.896
-Just wait for the green light.

1:06:18.979 --> 1:06:21.607
And here we go. So press in on the clutch.

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:23.734
And give it a little gas.

1:06:23.817 --> 1:06:25.152
Slowly let out on the clu--

1:06:25.235 --> 1:06:26.445
Oh, you're not in gear.

1:06:27.613 --> 1:06:29.031
Green!

1:06:29.114 --> 1:06:32.910
Press in on the clutch, shift into fi--
You don't have to turn the key.

1:06:32.993 --> 1:06:34.411
-Go!
-Just press in--

1:06:34.953 --> 1:06:37.456
-Oh, my God.
-Press in on the--

1:06:37.539 --> 1:06:39.249
-Slowly let out the clutch,

1:06:39.333 --> 1:06:40.709
-then press the gas.
-I can't do this.

1:06:40.792 --> 1:06:42.961
-That is all you have to do.
-I can't do this.

1:06:43.962 --> 1:06:45.881
No, Otto. Otto, no.

1:06:47.007 --> 1:06:47.841
What?

1:06:47.925 --> 1:06:49.635
Oh, shit.

1:06:49.718 --> 1:06:50.928
What is wrong with you?

1:06:51.512 --> 1:06:53.305
She's learning how to drive.

1:06:53.388 --> 1:06:55.432
Did you not have to learn how to drive?

1:06:55.516 --> 1:06:58.685
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

1:06:58.769 --> 1:07:02.147
I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

1:07:03.023 --> 1:07:05.526
If you honk that horn one more time,

1:07:05.609 --> 1:07:08.153
it'll be the last thing you do.
You hear me? Huh?

1:07:08.779 --> 1:07:09.821
¿Comprende?

1:07:12.324 --> 1:07:13.325
Oh, shit.

1:07:17.162 --> 1:07:18.413
Now you listen to me.

1:07:19.248 --> 1:07:22.709
You have given birth to two children.
Soon it'll be three.

1:07:22.793 --> 1:07:26.630
You have come here
from a country very far away.

1:07:26.713 --> 1:07:28.298
You learned a new language,

1:07:28.382 --> 1:07:30.884
you got yourself an education
and a nitwit husband

1:07:30.968 --> 1:07:33.053
and you are holding that family together.

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:35.639
You will have no problem
learning how to drive.

1:07:35.722 --> 1:07:37.891
My God,
the world is full of complete idiots

1:07:37.975 --> 1:07:40.811
who have managed to figure it out,
and you are not a complete idiot.

1:07:45.148 --> 1:07:46.149
So...

1:07:47.317 --> 1:07:48.318
Clutch.

1:07:49.236 --> 1:07:50.362
Shift.

1:07:51.029 --> 1:07:52.239
Gas.

1:07:53.448 --> 1:07:54.533
Drive.

1:08:01.665 --> 1:08:03.542
Ah...

1:08:04.168 --> 1:08:05.169
Yeah.

1:08:10.465 --> 1:08:11.717
Que bueno.

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:12.843
Que bueno.

1:08:15.262 --> 1:08:17.555
Okay, there's a spot right there.

1:08:17.639 --> 1:08:19.892
Just pull up, parallel,

1:08:19.975 --> 1:08:24.854
and back the car up until that bumper
is in line with your side-view mirror.

1:08:26.023 --> 1:08:27.274
Now straighten out.

1:08:28.108 --> 1:08:29.902
Back up all the way up to the curb.

1:08:32.946 --> 1:08:34.656
-A little bit.
-Well, a little bit.

1:08:34.740 --> 1:08:35.782
And stop.

1:08:36.825 --> 1:08:37.868
Neutral.

1:08:39.286 --> 1:08:40.287
-Brake.

1:08:40.370 --> 1:08:41.371
Key.

1:08:44.457 --> 1:08:45.626
Is that it?

1:08:45.709 --> 1:08:46.752
That's it.

1:08:47.669 --> 1:08:49.587
-And we're right on time.

1:08:50.839 --> 1:08:51.840
I have it.

1:08:51.924 --> 1:08:54.968
-Uh-huh.

1:08:55.051 --> 1:08:56.678
-These are semlors.

1:08:58.930 --> 1:09:01.600
-Swedish éclairs.
-Oh!

1:09:01.683 --> 1:09:02.893
They're a little messy.

1:09:03.769 --> 1:09:05.187
-But let's try.
-Yes.

1:09:05.270 --> 1:09:06.313
With your finger.

1:09:10.734 --> 1:09:12.361
Mmm!

1:09:14.613 --> 1:09:16.323
How did you find this place?

1:09:17.198 --> 1:09:18.658
This was Sonya's place.

1:09:21.036 --> 1:09:23.580
We used to come here
every Saturday at- 00.

1:09:25.874 --> 1:09:27.417
And then? What?

1:09:28.001 --> 1:09:29.252
Go home at- 00.

1:09:30.546 --> 1:09:32.548
I'd wash and wax the car,

1:09:32.631 --> 1:09:37.176
and she would grade her papers and cook
and spend the rest of the day reading.

1:09:37.803 --> 1:09:39.095
What kind of books?

1:09:40.346 --> 1:09:41.974
-Her books.

1:09:43.267 --> 1:09:45.519
I tried to read some of them, but...

1:09:45.602 --> 1:09:46.603
I'm just...

1:09:47.395 --> 1:09:48.522
I'm not into books.

1:09:49.982 --> 1:09:52.109
Her friends said
that we were like night and day.

1:09:55.279 --> 1:09:57.698
My life was black-and-white
before I met Sonya.

1:09:58.824 --> 1:09:59.908
She was the colour.

1:10:03.579 --> 1:10:04.997
I would have liked her.

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:06.415
She was a force of nature.

1:10:07.541 --> 1:10:10.627
She convinced the school
to start up a programme

1:10:10.711 --> 1:10:12.254
for the kids that needed extra help.

1:10:12.337 --> 1:10:14.548
A lot of kids had problems at home

1:10:14.631 --> 1:10:17.718
or, uh, social anxieties.

1:10:18.343 --> 1:10:21.096
But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

1:10:21.180 --> 1:10:22.764
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1:10:26.643 --> 1:10:29.104
I ran into one of her students,

1:10:30.147 --> 1:10:31.356
just the other day.

1:10:33.775 --> 1:10:35.235
A kid named Malcolm.

1:10:41.491 --> 1:10:42.910
You need more cream.

1:10:42.993 --> 1:10:44.203
Okay.

1:10:48.624 --> 1:10:52.920
We all got along fine, of course,
when we first moved in.

1:10:53.003 --> 1:10:54.296
It was like a gift.

1:10:54.379 --> 1:10:56.256
Welcome to the neighbourhood.

1:10:56.340 --> 1:10:58.342
-Hi, I'm Sonya.
-I'm Anita.

1:10:58.425 --> 1:11:01.011
Sonya and Anita were best friends.

1:11:01.094 --> 1:11:03.013
So I got my Allen keys...

1:11:03.096 --> 1:11:05.516
And Reuben and I were a lot alike.

1:11:05.599 --> 1:11:06.934
Hey! Slow down!

1:11:07.684 --> 1:11:08.894
About most things.

1:11:09.645 --> 1:11:10.646
Idiot.

1:11:10.729 --> 1:11:12.481
But people change.

1:11:12.564 --> 1:11:14.274
Or they don't change.

1:11:15.192 --> 1:11:18.237
Things happen. People drift apart.

1:11:19.196 --> 1:11:21.949
They build walls. They take offence.

1:11:23.450 --> 1:11:24.743
Who knows why.

1:11:27.412 --> 1:11:30.249
Maybe it was all the construction
that drove everybody crazy.

1:11:30.332 --> 1:11:33.210
You know, there used to be
a forest up on that hill.

1:11:33.293 --> 1:11:35.337
That's why they call it Birchwood.

1:11:35.420 --> 1:11:37.339
Then they started building
all those condos

1:11:37.422 --> 1:11:38.674
and cut down all the birches.

1:11:38.757 --> 1:11:41.677
They didn't even realise
what they were doing until we told them,

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:42.761
Reuben and I.

1:11:43.470 --> 1:11:45.013
But this was before the coup?

1:11:45.097 --> 1:11:47.850
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Reuben and I were friends then.

1:11:47.933 --> 1:11:51.478
After that,
all we saw were the differences.

1:12:22.301 --> 1:12:26.722
A few years later, their son, Chris,
he, uh, took a job in Japan,

1:12:26.805 --> 1:12:29.349
and I don't think
he's been back to visit them since.

1:12:30.517 --> 1:12:32.519
-Oh.
-Reuben and he never did get along.

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:36.190
Anyway, that's when I decided
to bury the hatchet.

1:12:36.273 --> 1:12:37.274
Reuben.

1:12:39.109 --> 1:12:40.319
Hey.

1:12:41.653 --> 1:12:44.156
Sonya gave me this a while back.

1:12:44.239 --> 1:12:45.866
Never found the occasion.

1:12:47.284 --> 1:12:49.870
I thought maybe we could start fresh.

1:12:53.999 --> 1:12:56.210
Hey, would you like to see my new car?

1:12:57.836 --> 1:12:58.962
Sure.

1:12:59.046 --> 1:13:00.214
It's a new model.

1:13:00.881 --> 1:13:02.341
Just came out.

1:13:07.971 --> 1:13:09.014
Voilà.

1:13:11.558 --> 1:13:12.476
A Toyota?

1:13:14.102 --> 1:13:15.979
You bought a Toyota.

1:13:16.063 --> 1:13:18.023
Celica GT convertible.

1:13:18.106 --> 1:13:20.526
Five-speed automatic.

1:13:21.193 --> 1:13:23.153
You gotta change with the times.

1:13:24.071 --> 1:13:25.197
Otto!

1:13:27.032 --> 1:13:31.036
I don't know what went wrong with Reuben,
but that's when I knew I'd lost him.

1:13:31.119 --> 1:13:33.288
I mean, a man has to stand up
for what he believes in.

1:13:33.372 --> 1:13:36.041
Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

1:13:39.253 --> 1:13:43.632
And you and Sonya,
did you ever think about having children?

1:13:47.678 --> 1:13:49.596
Well,- 00.

1:13:51.974 --> 1:13:52.975
Okay.

1:13:54.810 --> 1:13:55.811
Yes.

1:14:01.024 --> 1:14:03.819
I was wondering
if you could help us out tonight.

1:14:03.902 --> 1:14:06.613
Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time
to go out for dinner

1:14:06.697 --> 1:14:07.990
before the baby comes.

1:14:08.073 --> 1:14:10.409
I'm not gonna drive you two
around on a date.

1:14:10.993 --> 1:14:13.871
No. We're gonna take a cab.

1:14:14.955 --> 1:14:16.707
What do you need me for, then?

1:14:16.790 --> 1:14:19.960
-Mama, I did not! Why would I?
-Yes, you did!

1:14:20.043 --> 1:14:21.795
-Give it back!
-You gotta catch me!

1:14:21.879 --> 1:14:23.714
You guys, por favor.

1:14:28.468 --> 1:14:30.762
And learn to share your everything.

1:14:32.097 --> 1:14:33.640
I'm not sure about this.

1:14:33.724 --> 1:14:36.727
No. Don't be silly.
It's gonna be very fun.

1:14:36.810 --> 1:14:40.606
If you remember,
Abbie has to be in bed by- 00, okay?

1:14:40.689 --> 1:14:42.024
-You're good?

1:14:43.525 --> 1:14:46.862
So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

1:14:46.945 --> 1:14:50.115
I'm setting it to "Armed Stay."
Are you paying attention?

1:14:50.199 --> 1:14:51.825
So if you wanna go out,

1:14:51.909 --> 1:14:55.162
you just have to press this button here,
and it's disalarmed.

1:14:55.245 --> 1:14:56.997
I'll be right here.

1:14:58.081 --> 1:14:59.333
Right. Yeah.

1:15:00.292 --> 1:15:01.668
Well, you never know.

1:15:01.752 --> 1:15:03.504
Be good to Abuelo Otto please, okay?

1:15:03.587 --> 1:15:04.713
We will!

1:15:08.926 --> 1:15:10.636
I don't see chocolate milk in here.

1:15:10.719 --> 1:15:14.473
You make it with the syrup.
But not too much. It'll keep her awake.

1:15:16.642 --> 1:15:17.935
Give me milk.

1:15:18.018 --> 1:15:19.269
What is that?

1:15:19.353 --> 1:15:22.231
That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

1:15:23.941 --> 1:15:26.485
Dad said he wanted
to throw it out the window,

1:15:26.568 --> 1:15:28.987
but Mom said Dad isn't allowed
to open windows anymore.

1:15:34.785 --> 1:15:35.786
Head.

1:15:36.870 --> 1:15:37.871
Cabeza.

1:15:38.664 --> 1:15:40.499
-Cabeza.

1:15:40.582 --> 1:15:41.458
Good.

1:15:42.334 --> 1:15:43.210
Eyes.

1:15:43.794 --> 1:15:44.795
Ojos.

1:15:44.878 --> 1:15:47.381
-Ojos.

1:15:49.049 --> 1:15:49.883
Good.

1:15:49.967 --> 1:15:52.010
Arm. Brazo.

1:15:52.094 --> 1:15:54.346
Arm. Brazo.

1:15:54.429 --> 1:15:55.305
Good.

1:16:01.186 --> 1:16:03.230
I don't think this is a good idea.

1:16:03.313 --> 1:16:04.523
Why?

1:16:05.649 --> 1:16:08.485
Because no one stands a chance
against a luchadoro.

1:16:08.569 --> 1:16:10.988
Abuelo Luchadoro!

1:16:11.613 --> 1:16:13.156
Abuelo Luchadoro!

1:16:14.449 --> 1:16:16.076
Help me, help me.

1:16:16.159 --> 1:16:17.703
Wait, no, he started it.

1:16:18.662 --> 1:16:20.998
-Ready?
-Rub it and smack!

1:16:21.707 --> 1:16:24.710
Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop!

1:16:35.929 --> 1:16:36.930
Huh.

1:17:01.747 --> 1:17:03.373
Wow, it's awfully quiet, huh?

1:17:08.629 --> 1:17:10.631
-Hey, guys.

1:17:10.714 --> 1:17:12.049
Hi.

1:17:12.674 --> 1:17:13.509
Hi.

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:15.969
She was already asleep.

1:17:18.222 --> 1:17:19.515
How was it?

1:17:20.682 --> 1:17:23.310
-Fine.
-You did a good job tonight, Otto.

1:17:23.393 --> 1:17:24.937
You should pat yourself on the back.

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:36.365
-Thank you, Otto.
-Yeah.

1:17:36.448 --> 1:17:37.699
Exit now.

1:17:37.783 --> 1:17:38.951
Have a good night.

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:41.161
Okay.

1:17:57.261 --> 1:17:58.428
How did he do that?

1:18:05.227 --> 1:18:07.187
-Hi, Otto.
-Malcolm.

1:18:07.271 --> 1:18:11.024
You can't hear your chain rattle
when you switch gears like that?

1:18:11.108 --> 1:18:13.652
-My bike's getting old.
-Don't blame the bike.

1:18:13.735 --> 1:18:15.654
You just have to adjust your derailleur.

1:18:16.905 --> 1:18:19.533
-My what?
-Your derailleur needs adjusting.

1:18:23.203 --> 1:18:24.997
Uh, excuse me.

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.832
-Hi, I'm Shari Kenzie.
-Hi.

1:18:26.915 --> 1:18:29.084
I'm a social media journalist.

1:18:29.168 --> 1:18:32.337
I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson.

1:18:32.421 --> 1:18:34.423
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1:18:40.888 --> 1:18:44.099
Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

1:18:44.183 --> 1:18:46.351
You treat it right, it'll treat you right.

1:18:46.435 --> 1:18:48.270
Here. Keep the set.

1:18:48.353 --> 1:18:49.479
Thanks, Otto.

1:18:50.272 --> 1:18:54.776
I can't believe I'm helping you
throw crap onto people's lawns.

1:18:54.860 --> 1:18:56.195
Isn't two jobs enough?

1:18:57.279 --> 1:18:58.864
I'm saving up for a car.

1:18:58.947 --> 1:19:00.282
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:19:00.365 --> 1:19:01.909
What kind?

1:19:01.992 --> 1:19:03.118
Volkswagen.

1:19:11.752 --> 1:19:13.712
Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

1:19:13.795 --> 1:19:16.965
Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie.

1:19:17.049 --> 1:19:19.551
I'm a social media journalist, and I--

1:19:19.635 --> 1:19:20.969
What is that?

1:19:21.053 --> 1:19:24.640
I have an online series
called Everyday Heroes.

1:19:24.723 --> 1:19:27.726
What you did the other day
at the train station was amazing.

1:19:27.809 --> 1:19:29.144
You saved that man's life.

1:19:29.228 --> 1:19:30.646
You have the wrong guy.

1:19:31.772 --> 1:19:35.400
No, I don't. I've watched the video
at least a dozen times.

1:19:35.484 --> 1:19:36.944
-It's you.
-Video?

1:19:37.027 --> 1:19:38.362
You haven't seen it?

1:19:38.445 --> 1:19:42.157
Oh. A commuter recorded what happened
on their phone and posted it online.

1:19:42.241 --> 1:19:45.953
Someone in the comments recognised you.
That's how I tracked you down.

1:19:46.036 --> 1:19:47.955
It's gotten over a million views.

1:19:48.038 --> 1:19:49.790
A million? A million.

1:19:49.873 --> 1:19:52.167
Why can't people mind their own business?

1:19:52.251 --> 1:19:55.629
Because stories like yours are inspiring.

1:19:55.712 --> 1:19:57.840
If I could just talk to you
for a few minutes--

1:19:57.923 --> 1:20:00.342
No, now I've got too many things
I have to do.

1:20:00.425 --> 1:20:02.719
I recorded a video message
from the man you saved.

1:20:02.803 --> 1:20:03.929
You should see this.

1:20:04.012 --> 1:20:06.056
-Um... just pull it up.
-Otto! Hi!

1:20:06.932 --> 1:20:08.058
Good morning.

1:20:09.101 --> 1:20:09.977
Good morning.

1:20:11.603 --> 1:20:12.604
Uh...

1:20:12.688 --> 1:20:15.315
-So you ready for another driving lesson?

1:20:15.399 --> 1:20:17.317
-Now's not a good time.
-No?

1:20:17.401 --> 1:20:19.611
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

1:20:19.695 --> 1:20:21.405
-I didn't lock you in.
-Hello?

1:20:21.488 --> 1:20:23.699
Turn the knob, open the door.

1:20:23.782 --> 1:20:26.076
-Opened a door before, haven't you?

1:20:26.159 --> 1:20:27.160
Idiot.

1:20:29.788 --> 1:20:31.957
Otto! It's me.

1:20:32.040 --> 1:20:33.125
She's gone.

1:20:34.543 --> 1:20:36.503
Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

1:20:38.088 --> 1:20:39.965
"Social media journalist"?

1:20:40.048 --> 1:20:41.508
What the hell does that even mean?

1:20:42.301 --> 1:20:45.429
Buncha knotheads pointin'
a camera at themselves.

1:20:45.512 --> 1:20:47.181
I thought you handled it really well.

1:20:47.264 --> 1:20:49.308
I mean, closing her in your garage.

1:20:49.391 --> 1:20:53.020
That was, like, excellent strategy.

1:20:53.103 --> 1:20:55.898
-Good job.

1:20:58.567 --> 1:21:02.112
Otto, also, I was thinking
you've done so much for us.

1:21:02.196 --> 1:21:05.115
-I wanna do something for you too.
-I don't need anything.

1:21:05.199 --> 1:21:08.952
Well, I think you could do
with some decent food. Sometimes. No?

1:21:09.036 --> 1:21:10.120
Those cookies...

1:21:10.204 --> 1:21:11.747
The what? The "salporanz"?

1:21:11.830 --> 1:21:14.208
Those are not bad. They're not bad.

1:21:14.917 --> 1:21:16.418
And, also, I was thinking

1:21:16.502 --> 1:21:20.923
that I can help you clean out your house
and clean out the front hall in your home,

1:21:21.006 --> 1:21:24.384
and help you pack the coats and shoes
you have there of Sonya's.

1:21:24.468 --> 1:21:25.677
That's not needed.

1:21:26.386 --> 1:21:29.515
No, but it can help you move on.

1:21:29.598 --> 1:21:31.225
I don't wanna move on.

1:21:31.308 --> 1:21:33.143
She's always gonna be with you.

1:21:33.227 --> 1:21:35.270
-But you're still here.
-Ah...

1:21:35.354 --> 1:21:36.480
That's enough.

1:21:37.981 --> 1:21:41.610
When my father died,
my mother, she stopped living.

1:21:41.693 --> 1:21:43.862
-She just stopped like she used--
-Stop talking!

1:21:44.821 --> 1:21:47.282
-Stop it.
-Okay! Don't yell at me.

1:21:48.909 --> 1:21:52.663
Why can't people mind
their own business? Idiots.

1:21:53.664 --> 1:21:55.123
Interrupting me at every turn.

1:21:55.207 --> 1:21:58.502
The more they babble, the more
they drown out the memory of her voice.

1:21:59.169 --> 1:22:02.047
I don't want to clear Sonya from my life.

1:22:02.130 --> 1:22:03.507
She was everything.

1:22:03.590 --> 1:22:06.343
There was nothing before her,
and there's nothing after!

1:22:07.386 --> 1:22:08.387
I'm something.

1:22:12.432 --> 1:22:14.059
That son of a bitch!

1:22:14.852 --> 1:22:17.020
Uh-uh. No, no, no.

1:22:17.104 --> 1:22:18.689
Uh-uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh.

1:22:18.772 --> 1:22:21.441
Stop right there. You stop that car!

1:22:21.525 --> 1:22:25.028
Did you leave that gate open?
You left that gate open, didn't you?

1:22:25.112 --> 1:22:26.738
You're the only one who gives a damn.

1:22:26.822 --> 1:22:28.699
I give a damn
about people following the rules.

1:22:28.782 --> 1:22:31.159
Yes, I know. I know all about you.

1:22:31.243 --> 1:22:33.996
There's a file on you at the office.
It's this thick.

1:22:34.079 --> 1:22:35.539
I know about your wife.

1:22:35.622 --> 1:22:37.624
How you blame whatever happened to her
on everybody else.

1:22:37.708 --> 1:22:38.709
You shut up.

1:22:38.792 --> 1:22:41.420
Don't you say one more word.

1:22:41.503 --> 1:22:44.590
Take it easy, Otto.
Look, I'm not trying to upset you,

1:22:44.673 --> 1:22:47.968
but you really shouldn't be living alone.

1:22:48.051 --> 1:22:52.723
I mean, we know more about you
than you probably realise, so...

1:22:52.806 --> 1:22:55.559
Just look after that heart of yours, okay?

1:22:55.642 --> 1:22:56.935
What do you know about my heart?

1:22:57.644 --> 1:22:59.855
Hey, what do you know about my heart?!

1:22:59.938 --> 1:23:01.899
You prying bastard!

1:23:01.982 --> 1:23:03.192
Otto, Otto.

1:23:03.984 --> 1:23:07.070
Otto, what's going on?
Are you okay? Do you feel okay?

1:23:07.154 --> 1:23:09.239
You wanna help me, close the gate.

1:23:22.794 --> 1:23:24.588
Otto. Otto.

1:23:25.756 --> 1:23:27.716
-Otto.

1:23:30.385 --> 1:23:31.386
Otto.

1:23:32.095 --> 1:23:34.640
Talk to me, Otto. Please?

1:23:38.227 --> 1:23:39.061
Otto.

1:23:45.692 --> 1:23:47.277
Talk to me, Otto.

1:24:01.750 --> 1:24:02.751
Otto.

1:24:06.255 --> 1:24:07.589
Otto.

1:24:25.566 --> 1:24:26.733
Thank you.

1:24:56.555 --> 1:24:58.265
It'll be cute on you.

1:24:58.348 --> 1:24:59.933
-No.
-Aw, c'mon.

1:25:00.017 --> 1:25:03.145
Honey, you look really cute.

1:27:47.726 --> 1:27:49.144
Give me your hand.

1:27:49.228 --> 1:27:50.812
The baby's really kicking.

1:28:03.867 --> 1:28:05.077

You're angry. I know.

1:30:57.124 --> 1:30:58.208
And sad.

1:31:00.127 --> 1:31:01.128
So am I.

1:31:03.630 --> 1:31:05.257
But now we have to live.

1:31:20.397 --> 1:31:21.481
What now?

1:31:27.362 --> 1:31:28.197
Malcolm.

1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:29.907
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

1:31:29.990 --> 1:31:31.742
I'm not gonna shoot you.

1:31:31.825 --> 1:31:32.868
What was that noise?

1:31:32.951 --> 1:31:36.079
The generator blew and the power is out.

1:31:36.163 --> 1:31:38.123
What d'ya want? It's freezing.

1:31:39.374 --> 1:31:41.835
I was hoping you might let me crash
on your couch for the night.

1:31:42.419 --> 1:31:43.795
This is not a hotel.

1:31:45.923 --> 1:31:47.633
No. I'm sorry.

1:31:47.716 --> 1:31:49.384
Why can't you go home?

1:31:52.262 --> 1:31:53.680
My dad kicked me out.

1:31:59.186 --> 1:32:00.896
There's a sofa you can use.

1:32:01.647 --> 1:32:05.025
Don't go into the dining room.
The ceiling needs repair.

1:32:05.108 --> 1:32:07.194
It's upstairs in Sonya's old study.

1:32:07.986 --> 1:32:10.072
So why did he kick you out?

1:32:10.155 --> 1:32:12.241
Because you're Malcolm now?

1:32:12.324 --> 1:32:14.326
Yeah, because I'm Malcolm.

1:32:14.409 --> 1:32:16.495
Because I dress like this.

1:32:17.246 --> 1:32:20.791
I read too much.
I don't like sports. Take your pick.

1:32:20.874 --> 1:32:23.043
He's embarrassed 'cause I'm trans.

1:32:23.126 --> 1:32:24.545
Then he's an idiot.

1:32:26.964 --> 1:32:28.257
This is you.

1:32:28.340 --> 1:32:30.008
Try not to touch anything.

1:32:30.092 --> 1:32:31.134
Okay.

1:33:30.903 --> 1:33:32.154
Well...

1:33:32.237 --> 1:33:33.780
Good morning. The power's still out

1:33:33.864 --> 1:33:36.408
so I cooked up the last of the eggs
while they're still good.

1:33:38.243 --> 1:33:39.203
Hope you don't mind.

1:33:40.329 --> 1:33:41.997
I have to do my rounds.

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:43.832
Don't you at least want some coffee first?

1:33:46.585 --> 1:33:47.586
Yes.

1:33:54.176 --> 1:33:55.177
There you go.

1:33:56.678 --> 1:33:57.721
Uh, some eggs?

1:33:58.889 --> 1:33:59.973
I wouldn't say no.

1:34:00.682 --> 1:34:01.683
All right.

1:34:19.785 --> 1:34:20.869
That can...

1:34:22.287 --> 1:34:23.288
goes in here.

1:34:26.708 --> 1:34:27.709
Hang that up.

1:34:33.674 --> 1:34:36.051
Hey, Otto! Making your rounds.

1:34:36.134 --> 1:34:38.637
You mind if I join you?
I need to get my steps in.

1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:39.721
-Okay.

1:34:40.472 --> 1:34:41.682
-I'm Jimmy.
-Malcolm.

1:34:41.765 --> 1:34:43.183
-Nice to meet you.
-Aw, thanks.

1:34:46.103 --> 1:34:46.937
Yes.

1:34:47.688 --> 1:34:48.689
Yes.

1:34:49.898 --> 1:34:53.485
Hey, Otto, if you want to slow down,
we can 'cause my beats are up.

1:34:53.569 --> 1:34:54.570
Yes.

1:35:08.584 --> 1:35:12.629
Otto, did you hear they're moving Reuben
into assisted living this afternoon?

1:35:12.713 --> 1:35:13.881
Who is?

1:35:13.964 --> 1:35:15.924
The Dye & Merika guys.

1:35:16.008 --> 1:35:17.134
-My God.

1:35:17.217 --> 1:35:19.678
They convinced Anita to sell the house.

1:35:19.761 --> 1:35:21.680
No, they made the deal with Chris.

1:35:21.763 --> 1:35:24.433
-Chris? He can't do that.
-Yeah, he can.

1:35:24.516 --> 1:35:27.686
After Dye & Merika found out
Anita had Parkinson's,

1:35:27.769 --> 1:35:29.730
they tracked Chris down and--

1:35:29.813 --> 1:35:30.939
-Parkinson's?
-Yeah.

1:35:31.023 --> 1:35:33.984
So last year Chris convinced Anita
to give him power of attorney

1:35:34.067 --> 1:35:35.360
in case she got worse.

1:35:35.444 --> 1:35:38.447
So Dye & Merika made the deal
with Chris to buy the house.

1:35:38.530 --> 1:35:39.615
Those pricks.

1:35:41.074 --> 1:35:44.244
Wait, Anita found out
she had Parkinson's last year?

1:35:44.953 --> 1:35:46.038
No, that's not right.

1:35:46.121 --> 1:35:48.916
She would've told Sonya.
Sonya would've told me.

1:35:50.125 --> 1:35:53.879
Well, Anita and Reuben
didn't want you and Sonya to know.

1:35:53.962 --> 1:35:56.757
They said you had enough
on your plate as it is.

1:35:58.425 --> 1:35:59.510
They said that?

1:36:10.812 --> 1:36:14.066
I need to see everything
you ever got from Dye & Merika.

1:36:14.149 --> 1:36:17.236
Notices, letters. Do you have
a copy of the power of attorney?

1:36:17.319 --> 1:36:18.946
How do you know about that?

1:36:19.029 --> 1:36:20.614
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

1:36:20.697 --> 1:36:21.698
-Get it.
-Yes.

1:36:23.617 --> 1:36:28.580
And any records
of Reuben's condition and yours.

1:36:28.664 --> 1:36:30.457
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1:36:30.541 --> 1:36:31.959
Can you get it now?

1:36:32.042 --> 1:36:33.043
Yes.

1:36:39.216 --> 1:36:40.342
I've been an idiot.

1:36:42.344 --> 1:36:45.722
I got so wrapped up in my own troubles,
I stopped thinking of anyone else.

1:36:45.806 --> 1:36:48.141
And I figured
they weren't thinking about me.

1:36:49.935 --> 1:36:51.520
Friends shouldn't do that.

1:36:51.603 --> 1:36:52.604
So...

1:36:54.398 --> 1:36:56.942
This isn't easy to say
after all this time.

1:36:57.985 --> 1:36:59.111
But I'm sorry.

1:37:01.989 --> 1:37:04.157
And I will sort all this out.

1:37:17.129 --> 1:37:18.297
I need to use your phone.

1:37:20.549 --> 1:37:22.217
Why can't you use your own?

1:37:23.218 --> 1:37:25.053
Mine is disconnected at the moment.

1:37:27.306 --> 1:37:29.725
-Why?
-That doesn't matter.

1:37:29.808 --> 1:37:31.852
I just need to use your phone, okay?

1:37:33.896 --> 1:37:35.063
You know what?

1:37:35.147 --> 1:37:36.148
No.

1:37:36.231 --> 1:37:37.691
-No?
-No.

1:37:38.817 --> 1:37:41.528
You won't tell me
why your phone is disconnected?

1:37:41.612 --> 1:37:44.948
You won't tell me
why you need to use my phone?

1:37:45.032 --> 1:37:48.160
You won't tell me what happened
to you in the street yesterday?

1:37:48.827 --> 1:37:51.955
And then you went inside
and you wouldn't even open the door?

1:37:53.874 --> 1:37:55.459
You scared me, Otto.

1:37:57.211 --> 1:37:59.254
Do you know how long I was out there?

1:37:59.338 --> 1:38:02.299
And I didn't know
if something had happened to you.

1:38:03.717 --> 1:38:05.802
Or if something was gonna happen to you.

1:38:07.095 --> 1:38:10.557
And I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

1:38:10.641 --> 1:38:12.059
But I was just trying to help.

1:38:13.477 --> 1:38:16.396
And you left me out there.

1:38:18.398 --> 1:38:21.193
So, no. You can't use my phone.

1:38:27.241 --> 1:38:30.577
You think your life is so hard
because everybody's an idiot

1:38:30.661 --> 1:38:32.579
and you have to do everything
on your own, right?

1:38:34.164 --> 1:38:34.998
Right?

1:38:36.333 --> 1:38:37.334
But guess what.

1:38:38.460 --> 1:38:39.670
You can't.

1:38:40.921 --> 1:38:41.922
No one can.

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:44.967
And I think you should just be happy

1:38:45.050 --> 1:38:47.386
that someone was trying
to help you get through a crappy day.

1:38:49.054 --> 1:38:50.556
Even if they're an idiot.

1:38:51.723 --> 1:38:54.059
-So...
-The real estate bastards

1:38:54.142 --> 1:38:57.104
are trying to force
Anita and Reuben out of their home.

1:38:57.855 --> 1:38:59.398
That's why I need to use your phone.

1:39:03.193 --> 1:39:04.945
Okay, fine. Come on.

1:39:21.461 --> 1:39:23.338
We had never had a vacation.

1:39:27.718 --> 1:39:29.261
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1:39:30.554 --> 1:39:34.224
And she wanted to do something special
before the baby came.

1:39:35.017 --> 1:39:37.519
So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

1:39:39.563 --> 1:39:41.440
On the way back, the bus crashed.

1:39:43.233 --> 1:39:45.694
There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

1:39:45.777 --> 1:39:47.821
but the company never had them fixed.

1:39:49.489 --> 1:39:50.866
Sonya was paralyzed...

1:39:52.451 --> 1:39:54.453
and we lost our son.

1:39:58.373 --> 1:40:00.792
After three months,
she was finally able to come home.

1:40:01.877 --> 1:40:04.796
But they had started building
the new condos

1:40:04.880 --> 1:40:08.091
and the community centre
and the walkways,

1:40:08.175 --> 1:40:11.303
none of which were designed
for people in wheelchairs.

1:40:12.179 --> 1:40:14.806
The builders could have
changed their plans.

1:40:15.682 --> 1:40:20.062
But the laws weren't in place back then,
and they didn't care.

1:40:20.687 --> 1:40:21.772
I did.

1:40:21.855 --> 1:40:25.234
-We're putting in a new playground...
-I cared.

1:40:25.317 --> 1:40:28.070
-There's places for people like your wife.
-And I was so angry.

1:40:28.153 --> 1:40:31.240
What does that mean?
People like her? What does that mean?

1:40:31.323 --> 1:40:33.784
-What're you tryin' to say?!
-Get off of me!

1:40:34.493 --> 1:40:38.830
That's when they voted me out
as head of the homeowners' association.

1:40:41.041 --> 1:40:43.085
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1:40:43.168 --> 1:40:46.922
The builders, and the realtors,
and the bus company, the bus driver.

1:40:47.005 --> 1:40:48.632
I never would have let it go...

1:40:50.342 --> 1:40:51.343
but for Sonya.

1:40:52.886 --> 1:40:54.555
Sonya said we had to keep living.

1:40:57.808 --> 1:40:58.892
That's what I did.

1:41:00.519 --> 1:41:01.770
I lived for Sonya.

1:41:06.358 --> 1:41:08.026
Six months ago she passed away.

1:41:08.902 --> 1:41:09.903
Cancer.

1:41:14.157 --> 1:41:15.450
I was going to join her.

1:41:17.286 --> 1:41:19.663
That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

1:41:22.708 --> 1:41:25.794
But now I think
she wants me to keep living.

1:41:28.422 --> 1:41:31.175
And I have things to do.

1:41:35.345 --> 1:41:38.140


1:42:03.165 --> 1:42:04.875
You're wasting your time, Otto.

1:42:04.958 --> 1:42:07.419
It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

1:42:07.503 --> 1:42:09.546
And if you get in our way,

1:42:09.630 --> 1:42:10.881
I'll have you arrested.

1:42:11.507 --> 1:42:14.384
-I'm not doing a thing.
-Don't you take another step.

1:42:15.302 --> 1:42:17.054
You are not taking my husband
away from me.

1:42:17.804 --> 1:42:21.308
Anita, please.
We're doing this for your own good.

1:42:21.391 --> 1:42:24.478
What you're doing
is trying to take my property.

1:42:25.354 --> 1:42:29.608
I want Reuben to stay right here
for the rest of his life,

1:42:29.691 --> 1:42:31.610
with me in our home.

1:42:31.693 --> 1:42:35.864
Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben
when you're no longer able to?

1:42:35.948 --> 1:42:38.367
Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

1:42:38.450 --> 1:42:41.453
Otto's not in the best health either.
Are you, Otto?

1:42:42.579 --> 1:42:43.789
I'll take care of 'em.

1:42:45.082 --> 1:42:48.585
-What are you doing? Put that down.
-Anita and Reuben are like family to me.

1:42:48.669 --> 1:42:50.420
I'll take care of them
as long as they need.

1:42:50.963 --> 1:42:52.589
They're not your family.

1:42:52.673 --> 1:42:56.218
Uh, their son, Chris, has decided
they're not fit enough to be on their own,

1:42:56.301 --> 1:42:58.220
and so what we're doing is--

1:42:58.303 --> 1:43:01.640
Excuse me. When was the last time
Chris saw his parents?

1:43:01.723 --> 1:43:05.394
He lives in Japan.
They've been estranged for 10 years.

1:43:05.477 --> 1:43:07.771
Chris would have no idea
how his parents are doing,

1:43:07.855 --> 1:43:09.523
except for what you told him.

1:43:09.606 --> 1:43:11.441
Okay. And who are you?

1:43:11.525 --> 1:43:13.402
My name is Shari Kenzie.

1:43:13.485 --> 1:43:15.404
Social media journalist.

1:43:15.487 --> 1:43:18.282
-We're streaming live right now.
-Uh...

1:43:18.365 --> 1:43:21.785
All right, all right,
shut that camera off. You can't film this.

1:43:21.869 --> 1:43:23.662
It's a public sidewalk.

1:43:24.329 --> 1:43:26.999
You told Anita's son, Chris,
that she had Parkinson's,

1:43:27.082 --> 1:43:30.878
but Anita never told anyone
about her diagnosis.

1:43:30.961 --> 1:43:33.046
So how did you know?

1:43:33.130 --> 1:43:35.257
I'd have to check the records.

1:43:36.133 --> 1:43:38.969
Mr Anderson over there
is something of a local hero.

1:43:39.052 --> 1:43:44.266
He tells me you know details
about his private health records as well.

1:43:44.349 --> 1:43:46.143
So how are you and your company

1:43:46.226 --> 1:43:49.396
getting illegal access
to the medical records of seniors?

1:43:51.857 --> 1:43:54.067
Okay, let's go. We're done. We're done.

1:43:54.151 --> 1:43:55.903
Very nice to meet you.

1:43:55.986 --> 1:43:57.696
No, you're done. You're done!

1:43:57.779 --> 1:44:00.115
-Get that goddamn camera out of my face.
-Goodbye.

1:44:00.199 --> 1:44:02.075
-We did it!
-Oh, we did!

1:44:04.203 --> 1:44:05.454
Bye, thank you!

1:44:05.537 --> 1:44:08.457
I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story
an hour ago.

1:44:09.374 --> 1:44:11.168
Already dozens of people are saying

1:44:11.251 --> 1:44:13.962
Dye & Merika forced them
out of their homes.

1:44:14.046 --> 1:44:15.797
-That was easy.
-Yeah, goodbye.

1:44:15.881 --> 1:44:19.218
If you have a story,
share it with me at Shari_Kenzie.

1:44:19.301 --> 1:44:21.512
-I got it. I got it.

1:44:22.888 --> 1:44:25.307
Hey, you forgot to shut the gate!

1:44:25.390 --> 1:44:28.310
You see that?
He just rolled right over. Gave up.

1:44:28.393 --> 1:44:30.604
In our day, the bastards would
at least put up a fight.

1:44:32.064 --> 1:44:33.607
They haven't gotten rid of us yet.

1:44:42.950 --> 1:44:44.159
Yeah.

1:44:44.243 --> 1:44:46.453
It does feel pretty good. Doesn't it?

1:44:53.794 --> 1:44:56.547
Neighbourly neighbours,
a thing of the past?

1:44:56.630 --> 1:45:00.717
Well, I'm here with eyewitnesses
Anita and Jimmy to find out more.

1:45:00.801 --> 1:45:03.929
Jimmy, you mentioned that Anita
and Reuben are like family to you.

1:45:04.012 --> 1:45:05.681
What does that mean, exactly?

1:45:05.764 --> 1:45:08.517
Well, I have dinner at their house
nearly every single night.

1:45:12.980 --> 1:45:16.316
I know what you're waiting for.
You're ready for lunch, aren't you?

1:45:17.067 --> 1:45:18.819
I know what you want.

1:45:21.613 --> 1:45:23.156
Whoa. Here we go.

1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:25.033
You moved into this community recently.

1:45:25.117 --> 1:45:27.244
-How has that been for you?
-It's been beautiful.

1:45:27.327 --> 1:45:30.163
And your family,
to have people there that are--

1:45:30.247 --> 1:45:31.206
Yeah.

1:45:31.290 --> 1:45:33.083
-Otto?
-Will you air this in Mexico?

1:45:33.166 --> 1:45:34.168
Otto!

1:45:35.043 --> 1:45:37.171
Call an ambulance!

1:45:51.852 --> 1:45:53.854
-Ms Mendes? You can see him now.
-Yes?

1:45:53.937 --> 1:45:55.647
Yes. Yeah.

1:46:00.819 --> 1:46:03.113
Hola, Abuelo Otto.

1:46:18.045 --> 1:46:19.046
Ms Mendes?

1:46:19.630 --> 1:46:21.048
I'm Dr Ellis.

1:46:21.131 --> 1:46:23.217
Mr Anderson listed you as next of kin.

1:46:24.092 --> 1:46:26.845
Yes. Yes, that's correct.

1:46:26.929 --> 1:46:30.015
Your uncle had a close call.
Has he spoken to you about his condition?

1:46:30.849 --> 1:46:32.142
Mm...

1:46:32.226 --> 1:46:33.977
No, not really. No.

1:46:34.061 --> 1:46:36.563
It's called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

1:46:37.147 --> 1:46:39.775
Basically, his heart is too big.

1:46:42.402 --> 1:46:43.403
Too big?

1:46:43.487 --> 1:46:44.488
Mm-hm.

1:46:45.697 --> 1:46:46.698
Oh, okay.

1:46:47.866 --> 1:46:48.700
Oh.

1:46:55.415 --> 1:46:56.875
No, sorry. It's okay.

1:47:08.303 --> 1:47:10.973
You're really bad at dying, you know that?

1:47:16.854 --> 1:47:18.605
Ay.

1:47:22.734 --> 1:47:24.570
Otto, I think it's time.

1:47:25.904 --> 1:47:26.989
I think it's time.

1:47:28.407 --> 1:47:29.449
It's time.

1:47:29.533 --> 1:47:32.578
Oh, uh, I'm a cardiologist.
I'll page OB for you.

1:47:35.998 --> 1:47:39.168
Do something. It's time!

1:47:47.092 --> 1:47:48.677
All right, ready?

1:47:48.760 --> 1:47:50.596
All right, picture, everybody!

1:47:54.683 --> 1:47:56.226
Picture, picture, picture.

1:47:58.437 --> 1:48:00.981
All right. Ready? Everybody say, "Marco."

1:48:01.064 --> 1:48:03.609
One, two, three.

1:48:03.692 --> 1:48:06.653
Marco!

1:48:09.698 --> 1:48:10.866
Otto!

1:48:10.949 --> 1:48:13.285
-Hola. Hi!
-Hey, Otto. Come in.

1:48:13.368 --> 1:48:15.495
Everyone, this is our friend Otto.

1:48:15.579 --> 1:48:16.705
Hi, Otto!

1:48:19.249 --> 1:48:20.751
Hey, Otto.

1:48:20.834 --> 1:48:24.338
Sorry, is this about the cars
that are in front?

1:48:24.421 --> 1:48:26.507
No, I brought you something.

1:48:29.092 --> 1:48:30.511
Otto.

1:48:30.594 --> 1:48:32.179
Otto.

1:48:33.263 --> 1:48:34.890
I gave it a fresh coat of paint.

1:48:34.973 --> 1:48:36.600
I love it.

1:48:36.683 --> 1:48:38.227
-It's for the baby.
-Yes.

1:48:39.561 --> 1:48:42.523
Thank you.
Okay, hold him one second, please.

1:48:42.606 --> 1:48:44.316
-Why?
-To show Tommy.

1:48:44.399 --> 1:48:46.151
Hold him. Oh, he's gonna cry.

1:48:46.235 --> 1:48:48.529
-Whoa...

1:48:50.405 --> 1:48:52.324
I'll be right back, bebé. Okay.

1:48:52.407 --> 1:48:53.492
Tomaso?

1:48:53.575 --> 1:48:54.785
Hello. There we are.

1:48:54.868 --> 1:48:57.871
-Uh, should I put this thing back in him?

1:49:01.959 --> 1:49:02.960
There.

1:49:03.544 --> 1:49:05.128
Oh. Yeah.

1:49:05.212 --> 1:49:06.505
Okay.

1:49:06.588 --> 1:49:08.507
Yo soy Abuelo Otto.

1:49:09.633 --> 1:49:10.634
Okay?

1:49:13.262 --> 1:49:18.100
Uh, well, let me show you how this works.

1:49:20.435 --> 1:49:22.396
You don't have to do anything.

1:49:22.479 --> 1:49:23.564
Easy.

1:49:24.565 --> 1:49:25.858
Your little head...

1:49:27.150 --> 1:49:28.986
Now, you just go...

1:49:29.862 --> 1:49:30.863
like so.

1:49:32.239 --> 1:49:33.073
Huh?

1:49:58.098 --> 1:49:59.808
Sonya, this is Abbie and Luna.

1:49:59.892 --> 1:50:01.768
They have something for you.

1:50:03.353 --> 1:50:05.314
-Hi, Sonya.

1:50:06.523 --> 1:50:10.360
-That's, uh, brand-new little Marco there.

1:50:10.944 --> 1:50:13.906
And Marisol, Tommy. I told you about them.

1:50:15.199 --> 1:50:17.117
Say, "Hola. Hola, Sonya."

1:50:17.201 --> 1:50:19.036
She loved pink flowers, girls.

1:50:19.119 --> 1:50:20.120
You chose well.

1:50:21.622 --> 1:50:22.915
I like pink too.

1:50:30.506 --> 1:50:31.673
You see that?

1:50:55.614 --> 1:50:57.115
-Ready?
-Yes.

1:51:02.079 --> 1:51:03.121
Okay.

1:51:42.369 --> 1:51:43.370
No.

1:51:44.663 --> 1:51:45.914
No, no, no.

1:51:46.623 --> 1:51:47.916
Come on, Otto.

1:51:56.508 --> 1:51:58.969
All right, Malcolm,
check that oil. Check it.

1:51:59.052 --> 1:52:01.763
And let's see, what does it say?

1:52:02.347 --> 1:52:03.807
Looks good, right?

1:52:03.891 --> 1:52:05.809
-If you say so.
-Okay.

1:52:05.893 --> 1:52:08.437
That's it. Okay, now...

1:52:09.438 --> 1:52:10.439
Here's your manual.

1:52:11.148 --> 1:52:12.274
Here's your papers.

1:52:13.442 --> 1:52:14.568
And the key.

1:52:14.651 --> 1:52:15.694
It's your car.

1:52:16.862 --> 1:52:18.071
Are you kidding me?

1:52:18.155 --> 1:52:19.198
Nope.

1:52:19.281 --> 1:52:20.115
What?

1:52:20.199 --> 1:52:22.075
Otto!

1:52:22.159 --> 1:52:24.369
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

1:52:25.621 --> 1:52:28.624
-Oh, my gosh.
-Saved you from a Volkswagen.

1:52:28.707 --> 1:52:30.876
I have a car! I have a car!

1:52:30.959 --> 1:52:33.128
-This is your car!
-Are you kidding me?

1:52:42.179 --> 1:52:44.181
Otto? You got your truck!

1:52:44.264 --> 1:52:46.266
Oh, my God!

1:52:46.350 --> 1:52:47.935
Wanna go for a ride?

1:52:48.977 --> 1:52:50.938
-Let's go for a ride?
-That's a nice truck, Otto.

1:52:51.021 --> 1:52:52.564
Be careful.

1:52:52.648 --> 1:52:54.233
I like your car, Otto.

1:52:54.316 --> 1:52:56.652
Yeah? Wait till you see how it rides.

1:52:59.947 --> 1:53:01.907
It's enormous.

1:53:01.990 --> 1:53:04.826
This is like Otto's luchador
monster truck.

1:53:04.910 --> 1:53:07.246
Yeah. Do you have any comics?

1:53:07.329 --> 1:53:08.789
Can we get Swedish éclairs?

1:53:08.872 --> 1:53:10.082

Okay. Here we go.

1:53:40.988 --> 1:53:42.990
Okay?

1:53:48.537 --> 1:53:50.789
-I can't believe Marco's 3 already.
-You're such a big boy.

1:53:50.873 --> 1:53:52.165
-I'll get it, honey.

1:54:06.722 --> 1:54:07.723
Hey, honey?

1:54:07.806 --> 1:54:08.891
Eh?

1:54:10.142 --> 1:54:11.810
Otto hasn't shovelled his walk.

1:54:15.689 --> 1:54:16.940
Watch your brother.

1:54:29.912 --> 1:54:31.079
Get the keys.

1:54:43.550 --> 1:54:44.551
Otto?

1:54:46.887 --> 1:54:47.888
Otto.

1:54:48.555 --> 1:54:49.556
Otto.

1:54:58.815 --> 1:54:59.816
Otto.

1:55:07.616 --> 1:55:08.617
Yeah.

1:55:27.344 --> 1:55:28.345
Marisol.

1:55:40.774 --> 1:55:41.775
Marisol,

1:55:42.526 --> 1:55:44.695
if you're reading this, don't worry.

1:55:45.362 --> 1:55:47.447
I haven't done anything stupid.

1:55:49.616 --> 1:55:51.535
It turns out having a big heart

1:55:51.618 --> 1:55:53.662
isn't as nice as it sounds.

1:55:54.538 --> 1:55:57.457
The doctors warned me
it would get me in the end,

1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:01.753
so I planned ahead, that's all.

1:56:02.462 --> 1:56:05.090
The cat eats tuna twice a day

1:56:05.174 --> 1:56:07.885
and likes to do his business in private.

1:56:08.510 --> 1:56:09.595
Please respect that.

1:56:11.555 --> 1:56:13.098
I would like a funeral.

1:56:14.266 --> 1:56:15.726
We remember before you this day...

1:56:15.809 --> 1:56:17.060
But nothing overblown.

1:56:17.144 --> 1:56:18.187
...our brother Otto.

1:56:19.313 --> 1:56:21.356
Just a remembrance of some sort...

1:56:23.775 --> 1:56:27.070
for those people
who thought I pulled my weight.

1:56:29.865 --> 1:56:33.744
A local hero and good friend of the show
is being remembered today.

1:56:33.827 --> 1:56:34.828
Otto Anderson.

1:56:34.912 --> 1:56:37.289
Jimmy, would you like to say
a few words about Otto?

1:56:37.372 --> 1:56:39.541
Yeah. Otto, we love you.

1:56:39.625 --> 1:56:42.836
In your honour, Malcolm and I are doing

1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:47.299
all of your rounds without fail
around lunch and on weekdays.

1:56:48.634 --> 1:56:49.676
You loom large.

1:56:50.844 --> 1:56:54.056
My lawyer will give you access
to my bank accounts.

1:56:55.641 --> 1:56:57.684
I never wasted money on crap,

1:56:58.310 --> 1:57:00.854
so you'll have enough
to get the children through school.

1:57:00.938 --> 1:57:02.439
How'd you do that?

1:57:02.523 --> 1:57:05.192
And do what you like with the rest.

1:57:05.275 --> 1:57:06.610
Oh, good boy.

1:57:06.693 --> 1:57:07.945
Is that a doggie cake?

1:57:08.028 --> 1:57:09.279
My little monkey-poo.

1:57:12.449 --> 1:57:13.700
To Otto.

1:57:14.409 --> 1:57:17.871
The house, and everything in it, is yours,

1:57:18.789 --> 1:57:23.085
so long as you promise never to sell it
to those real estate bastards.

1:57:23.168 --> 1:57:24.962
And for God's sakes, Marisol...

1:57:25.045 --> 1:57:26.129
Tommy.

1:57:26.213 --> 1:57:28.298
...don't let Tommy drive the Chevy.

1:57:31.593 --> 1:57:32.594
Come on.

1:57:32.678 --> 1:57:34.972
Or anyone else, for that matter.

1:57:36.306 --> 1:57:38.517
I'm trusting it with you alone.

1:57:40.519 --> 1:57:44.273
Because you are not an idiot.

1:57:47.359 --> 1:57:49.820
