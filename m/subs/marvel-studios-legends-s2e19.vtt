00:39.330 --> 00:42.208
Auntie Carol? Mom, it's Auntie Carol!

00:43.334 --> 00:44.753
MARIA: You don't remember anything?

00:44.836 --> 00:47.213
I kept all your stuff.
This is you when you were little.

00:47.547 --> 00:51.176
You didn't get along with your parents,
so Mom said we became your real family.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.470
CAROL: Prepare for takeoff,
Lieutenant Trouble.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.056
-I could use a copilot.
-No. I can't leave Monica.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.766
-You have to go!
-Monica!

00:57.849 --> 01:00.185
You have a chance to fly
the coolest mission,

01:00.268 --> 01:03.313
and you're gonna give it up
to watch Fresh Prince with me?

01:03.897 --> 01:04.939
What?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.566
I just think you should consider

01:06.649 --> 01:09.027
what kind of example you're setting
for your daughter.

01:09.694 --> 01:10.904
CAROL: Your mom's lucky.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.990
When they were handing out kids,
they gave her the toughest one.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.327
-Lieutenant Trouble.
-You remembered.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.037
CAROL: I'll be back before you know it.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.623
Maybe I could fly up and meet you halfway?

01:22.040 --> 01:24.959
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.836
(CAROL ECHOING)

01:29.172 --> 01:30.882
CAROL: I'll be back before you know it.

01:33.676 --> 01:34.677
(GASPS)

01:34.761 --> 01:36.596
-MONICA: Excuse me.
-They're all coming back.

01:36.679 --> 01:37.889
We don't have the capacity.

01:39.599 --> 01:41.392
-(GASPS)
-(PEOPLE CLAMORING)

01:44.687 --> 01:46.314
-Monica?
-Dr. Highland, thank God!

01:46.397 --> 01:48.900
-I can't believe it.
-Dr. Highland, where's my mom?

01:49.901 --> 01:52.278
Your mom, she died, honey.

01:52.779 --> 01:56.866
Maria died three years ago.
Two years after you disappeared.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.498
Captain Monica Rambeau,
Let's get you back out there.

02:03.581 --> 02:08.002
The FBI is in a tizzy over
a missing persons case up in Jersey.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.505
-"Missing persons"?
-I know. But they have requested use

02:10.588 --> 02:13.758
of one of our imaging drones,
and I need a chaperone.

02:14.342 --> 02:16.761
Tyler, drones usually chaperone me.

02:17.220 --> 02:20.557
This isn't a missing person's case,
Captain Rambeau, it's a missing town.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.852
-Some sort of energy field. (GASPS)
-Careful, Rambeau.

02:25.103 --> 02:27.355
Captain Rambeau! Captain Rambeau!

02:27.647 --> 02:29.858
My equipment registered
a broadcast frequency.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.818
VoilÃ , sound and picture.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.904
-Is that...
-Yeah, it looks like her.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.948
I actually don't know what I'm doing here.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.117
-I'm Wanda.
-What am I looking at?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.912
DARCY: It's a sitcom.
1950s, 1960s, and now the '70s.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.248
Look at me.
(BREATHING RHYTHMICALLY)

02:45.331 --> 02:47.625
I can't believe
Wanda and Vision are having a baby.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.711
Twins! What a twist.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.087
I'm a twin.

02:52.547 --> 02:57.177
-I had a brother.
-He was killed by Ultron, wasn't he?

02:57.468 --> 02:58.720
What did you say?

02:58.803 --> 03:00.513
Did she just say the name Ultron?

03:00.889 --> 03:02.807
Has that happened?
A reference to our reality.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.892
DARCY: No. Never.

03:03.975 --> 03:08.062
WANDA: How did you know about Ultron?
You are a stranger.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.232
And I want you to leave.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.650
(GRUNTS)

03:20.533 --> 03:22.243
HAYWARD: What's the first thing
you do remember?

03:23.244 --> 03:28.625
MONICA: Pain. And then,
Wanda's voice in my head.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.376
HAYWARD: Did you try to resist?

03:31.002 --> 03:35.590
MONICA: There was this hopeless feeling
keeping me down. Like drowning.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.217
It was grief.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.927
(EERIE WAILING)

03:39.010 --> 03:41.638
It's all Wanda.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.807
DARCY: That would mean
she's wielding an insane amount of power.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.185
WOO: Far exceeding anything
she's displayed in the past.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.980
She could have taken out Thanos
on her own. Nobody else came close.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.149
I'd argue that Captain Marvel came close.

03:54.150 --> 03:58.446
We are not talking about her.
We are talking about Wanda.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.073
-We feel your pain.
-No.

04:00.156 --> 04:01.282
Your grief is poisoning us.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.368
We take her out,
this whole nightmare ends.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.494
MONICA: We don't know that.

04:04.577 --> 04:08.164
If Wanda is the problem,
she has to be our solution.

04:08.873 --> 04:10.166
And I'm gonna go get her out.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.418
DARCY: Whoa.
You can't go back into the Hex.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.711
Worst case scenario,

04:13.795 --> 04:16.923
Wanda removes my free will
and puts me in ultra-low-rise jeans.

04:17.006 --> 04:18.925
DARCY: You've gone through
the boundary twice already.

04:19.008 --> 04:23.388
The energy inside has re-written
your cells. It's changing you.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.431
Seen enough lab results
to last me a lifetime.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.601
Cells metastasizing, cells in remission.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.021
I know what Wanda's feeling
and I won't stop until I help her.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.861
(SCREAMS)

04:40.113 --> 04:41.656
(GROANING)

04:48.663 --> 04:50.164
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

05:04.929 --> 05:06.264
No, no, no! Stand down!

05:14.939 --> 05:16.274
I'm not afraid of you.

05:16.357 --> 05:19.736
The worst thing I can think of
has already happened to me.

05:20.111 --> 05:22.280
I lost the person closest to me, too.

05:23.114 --> 05:27.869
And I can't change it. I can't undo it.
I can't control this pain anymore.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.706
And I don't think I want to,
because it's my truth.

05:31.789 --> 05:32.790
(SCREAMS)

05:36.502 --> 05:38.129
So long, darling.

05:44.552 --> 05:48.473
I'm sorry. For all the pain I caused.

05:48.556 --> 05:51.642
Given the chance and given your power,

05:53.353 --> 05:54.896
I'd bring my mom back.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.734
-(SIRENS WAILING)
-Goodbye, Monica.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.153
Bye, Wanda.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.699
Captain Rambeau.
They're asking for you in the theater.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.707
I was sent by an old friend
of your mother's.

06:17.627 --> 06:19.379
-He'd like to meet with you.
-Where?

06:35.853 --> 06:38.564
-Monica, you've gotta fly.
-I haven't done that yet.

06:38.648 --> 06:39.941
Hey. Black girl magic.

06:41.818 --> 06:42.819
Whoo!
