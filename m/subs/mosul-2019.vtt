02:08.416 --> 02:09.791
I told you to aim higher!

02:12.208 --> 02:15.041
Stop talking to your friends
or I'll blow your head off!

02:15.958 --> 02:16.958
Go fight!

02:17.541 --> 02:18.541
Go fight!

02:26.916 --> 02:28.750
Don't throw another fucking grenade!

02:28.750 --> 02:29.791
We're back here too!

02:29.791 --> 02:31.208
Don't throw another one!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Shut up!

02:37.625 --> 02:40.041
Don't be afraid. All is good.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.083
The Boy! Worry about the Boy!

03:27.458 --> 03:29.208
Ammo? Ammo?

03:29.541 --> 03:31.416
No! Look for something sharp that could kill!

03:31.500 --> 03:34.625
They're out of ammo! They're out of ammo!

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Uncle?

04:07.250 --> 04:08.250
Uncle?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.125
Uncle?

04:19.958 --> 04:20.958
Clear?

04:23.041 --> 04:24.083
Clear?

04:27.541 --> 04:28.541
Clear!

04:30.625 --> 04:32.166
Secure the area.

04:32.166 --> 04:33.208
Be careful.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.750
SWAT.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.375
Two Policemen inside.

04:54.916 --> 04:56.500
God I hate guns.

05:04.625 --> 05:06.375
You two okay?

05:09.333 --> 05:12.541
What are uniformed Policemen
doing on this side of the City?

05:12.916 --> 05:14.750
Arresting these two, Sir.

05:16.708 --> 05:19.000
We're arresting people again?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.083
Yes, Sir.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.416
Progress.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.458
Daesh is starting to break. Run.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.500
Did they know that?

05:30.625 --> 05:32.291
Arresting them for what?

05:32.291 --> 05:33.333
Drugs, Sir.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.416
Crossing over to our side, trading
drugs for weapons, ammo.

05:36.416 --> 05:39.583
With friends like ours who needs enemies?

05:40.041 --> 05:41.541
How long have you been a Policeman?

05:41.958 --> 05:43.291
Two months, Sir.

05:44.875 --> 05:45.916
You can fight.

05:47.250 --> 05:48.541
You're the SWAT Team?

05:49.000 --> 05:50.291
SWAT?

05:50.708 --> 05:51.458
Yeah.

05:51.458 --> 05:52.833
We thought you were all dead.

05:53.041 --> 05:54.458
They're dead...

05:55.791 --> 05:58.166
I think they did too.

06:25.541 --> 06:26.541
Still good?

06:26.541 --> 06:27.791
All good.

06:28.833 --> 06:29.833
The List.

06:31.833 --> 06:32.916
Hurry.

06:36.458 --> 06:38.125
We thought you were all dead, Sir.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.666
Didn't you already say that?

06:44.125 --> 06:46.750
Only half the Unit died.

06:48.625 --> 06:53.500
The half who remembered you should
question suspects before stabbing them?

06:53.500 --> 06:56.291
We've heard all their answers.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.708
Then at least put bullets in their heads.

06:58.708 --> 07:00.375
Bomb! Bomb!

07:00.375 --> 07:02.166
White KIA turning left.
Move! Move!

07:20.041 --> 07:21.041
Clear?

07:25.666 --> 07:26.666
Clear?

07:26.666 --> 07:28.208
Clear!

07:28.208 --> 07:30.375
Get up...

07:30.375 --> 07:31.833
Move. Move.

07:44.458 --> 07:45.458
What's your full name?

07:48.625 --> 07:49.666
Why, Sir?

07:49.666 --> 07:52.333
If you're on the list, you're the enemy.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.708
Sir, he has a common name.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.291
There are ages next to the names.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.333
How old is the list, Sir?

07:57.333 --> 07:58.291
I don't know.

07:58.291 --> 07:59.291
Where did you get it?

07:59.291 --> 08:00.291
We've always had it.

08:00.375 --> 08:02.208
We're Policemen. Like all of you.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.541
Police?

08:03.541 --> 08:08.500
He was police. And him. And him. And him.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.708
And him. And-

08:11.833 --> 08:13.125
I am Jameel Al Qurtubi.

08:14.958 --> 08:16.041
Qurtubi.

08:17.500 --> 08:20.416
Jameel Ziad Al Qurtubi.

08:22.875 --> 08:26.000
Don't be afraid, you're not the enemy.

08:26.541 --> 08:27.541
Sir-

08:27.541 --> 08:29.250
Kawa Salah al-Faily.

08:30.916 --> 08:31.916
Your ID?

08:32.416 --> 08:36.833
I haven't been a Policeman
long enough to receive an ID.

08:42.875 --> 08:43.875
How old are you?

08:43.875 --> 08:45.375
21, Sir.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.750
Have either of you been wounded?

09:04.458 --> 09:05.458
No.

09:06.833 --> 09:10.291
I mean not just today, but ever?
Wounded by Daesh?

09:10.750 --> 09:12.708
You're the last two then.

09:13.500 --> 09:16.208
Have either of you lost family to Daesh?

09:16.208 --> 09:19.500
No, some were killed by the
Americans, some left with them.

09:20.708 --> 09:22.125
He was my Uncle.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.875
Did you love him?

09:24.875 --> 09:26.875
Of course I did.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.083
Why aren't you crying?

09:33.458 --> 09:34.833
I don't know.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.875
Are you married?

09:38.875 --> 09:41.750
Sir, I wouldn't be here if I was.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.916
What?

09:46.208 --> 09:47.416
What do you mean?

09:47.416 --> 09:49.750
Calm down, calm down.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.583
He's still a kid.

09:53.583 --> 09:54.875
Let him be.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.291
What did I say?

09:59.375 --> 10:00.375
Kamal.

10:13.541 --> 10:14.541
Him too?

10:15.291 --> 10:16.000
No.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
Why?

10:17.750 --> 10:20.958
He hasn't been wounded by Daesh or lost family to them.

10:20.958 --> 10:22.791
And all of you have?

10:23.458 --> 10:24.541
Most both.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.500
I don't really know who you are.

10:29.000 --> 10:32.583
We're the Men who killed the
Men who killed your Uncle.

10:32.583 --> 10:35.958
If you need to know more than that,
you shouldn't take the hat.

10:37.458 --> 10:38.958
I don't want to leave his body here.

10:38.958 --> 10:41.041
We won't leave him here.

10:47.375 --> 10:48.375
Let's go.

10:48.750 --> 10:51.291
We're taking Kurdish kids now?

10:51.541 --> 10:53.166
What's wrong with Kurds?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.166
I'll get your Uncle.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.208
Let's go guys. Fast.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.250
Take this off?

11:19.083 --> 11:20.208
You a medium?

11:21.875 --> 11:22.875
Medium.

11:22.875 --> 11:25.458
What do you think? We got a store?

11:48.916 --> 11:50.583
Here's a belt.

11:50.583 --> 11:52.625
Are you left or right handed?

11:53.041 --> 11:54.041
Left.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.333
Get back to the other side.

11:58.333 --> 12:01.083
Those weren't the only guys we
were trying to catch over here.

12:01.083 --> 12:02.625
Get back to the other side.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.958
Arresting people here and now is useless.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.583
Every jail in Iraq is a broken urn.

12:08.583 --> 12:10.666
Tell your superiors he's with us.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.500
My superiors think you're dead.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.750
Then they'll be anxious to hear
what you have to say. Go.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.750
Move.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.708
Here's your weapon.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.083
Kawa...

12:34.291 --> 12:35.833
Are you sure?

12:50.625 --> 12:52.291
Don't waste it.

12:52.291 --> 12:54.875
I'm going to wash his Uncle's blood off his hands.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.041
Waleed, Kamal...keep him between you.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.583
Watch us and you'll learn quick.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.041
Sorry about what I said.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.750
Where did you guys just come from?

13:30.750 --> 13:32.916
Did you go to the Gifted Students School?

13:32.916 --> 13:33.916
Yeah.

13:35.291 --> 13:37.791
I was a few years ahead of you. You look familiar.

13:39.583 --> 13:43.833
We were on mission, heard your service
pistols, assumed it was police in trouble.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.083
Thank you.

13:45.208 --> 13:50.083
Thank Major Jasem. If it had been up to
me we would have stayed on mission.

13:50.083 --> 13:52.166
What is your mission?

14:01.416 --> 14:03.208
It's OUR mission now.

14:03.208 --> 14:05.791
And if you fuck it up I'll kill you.

14:48.375 --> 14:52.125
Wait here and provide cover first.

14:55.916 --> 14:56.916
Thank you.

14:57.208 --> 14:58.083
What?

14:58.083 --> 15:00.208
Thank you. You saved my life.

15:05.541 --> 15:07.083
How long since your Dad died?

15:07.666 --> 15:09.708
How do you know my Dad is dead?

15:11.083 --> 15:12.833
I can tell you were raised well.

15:12.833 --> 15:14.541
Raised by a mother.

15:14.541 --> 15:16.458
Lift your weapon up and keep your eyes open.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.208
And don't thank me.

15:19.708 --> 15:21.333
We need the numbers.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.541
I smell a body...

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
It's right here.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.708
Clear!

15:38.833 --> 15:40.416
Let's take 10 minutes here to rest.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.708
Check if there is electricity...

16:08.833 --> 16:09.875
Shut up, Dick.

16:10.375 --> 16:11.416
You wanna go?

16:13.291 --> 16:17.916
Let's secure the 2nd floor.
The smell down here is killing me.

16:17.916 --> 16:19.041
Let's go guys.

16:21.916 --> 16:23.750
Just 10 minutes. I promise.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.291
You should eat something.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.000
Okay?

16:27.208 --> 16:29.541
And the 3rd Humvee won't be back for a bit anyway.

16:30.791 --> 16:31.958
As ordered, Sir.

16:44.791 --> 16:45.791
Kawa?

16:53.375 --> 16:54.375
Clear!

16:55.041 --> 16:58.125
We call this a "Stack". Two clear
the room, two provide cover.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.541
When ready, we touch the shoulder.

16:59.541 --> 17:02.041
Never stand in front of a door. You'll get killed.

17:05.083 --> 17:06.083
Clear!

17:09.708 --> 17:10.625
Clear!

17:11.833 --> 17:12.958
Found one!

17:23.041 --> 17:24.333
The Kuwaiti soap opera?

18:16.041 --> 18:17.541
Why's she starting a fight?

18:18.166 --> 18:20.208
Because she's pregnant and the other one isn't.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.291
Who's the woman in between them?

18:22.666 --> 18:26.750
I think the third wife - no, no, no - I mean the first wife.

18:27.041 --> 18:28.125
First or third?

18:28.416 --> 18:30.375
The first, the first, the one with the Mercedes.

18:30.375 --> 18:31.416
Let us watch!

18:31.416 --> 18:33.250
Let me answer his question!

18:34.375 --> 18:35.666
How many does he need?

18:36.208 --> 18:38.416
Kuwaitis, Bro.

18:41.833 --> 18:44.000
Kawa, sit.

18:44.541 --> 18:48.833
Whenever we have a chance to relax, take advantage.

19:11.375 --> 19:12.458
Give it a second.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.875
The third wife is really beautiful.

19:20.625 --> 19:23.666
One is enough trouble, let alone three.

19:39.208 --> 19:41.250
Hand me any trash...

19:54.958 --> 19:56.125
Kamal, hand me the money.

20:06.125 --> 20:07.875
What's the mission?

20:07.875 --> 20:09.666
You don't need to know.

20:10.875 --> 20:12.250
You don't trust me?

20:12.750 --> 20:13.541
Hell no.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.791
Get some rest. And you have to eat.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.166
What's this?

20:37.250 --> 20:38.125
Money.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.333
Why?

21:04.166 --> 21:05.291
Which would you go for?

21:05.291 --> 21:06.291
Any is good.

21:49.458 --> 21:50.666
Move.

21:53.416 --> 21:54.791
That's my partner!

21:54.791 --> 21:56.375
I told you to move away from here.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.166
Your partner is a son of a bitch traitor.

22:05.750 --> 22:06.791
How do you know?

22:26.291 --> 22:27.958
Let them all get out first?

22:30.166 --> 22:31.083
Get down!

22:51.750 --> 22:52.750
Everyone okay?

22:54.333 --> 22:55.333
Everyone okay?

23:09.833 --> 23:11.875
I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!

23:12.833 --> 23:14.750
What did I do? What did I do?

23:16.166 --> 23:17.333
Get the fuck off me!

23:20.583 --> 23:21.958
Get off me!

23:21.958 --> 23:23.041
The kid didn't do anything.

23:23.041 --> 23:24.125
I said get off me!

23:52.166 --> 23:53.500
Take these.

23:54.291 --> 23:57.166
These should go to one of his friends.

24:05.500 --> 24:07.083
I'm not a traitor.

24:09.125 --> 24:10.875
I'm not a traitor.

24:23.625 --> 24:25.250
Pick up your brother.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.250
Move.

24:32.833 --> 24:34.000
Careful of his head.

24:45.458 --> 24:46.500
Careful with his leg.

24:58.791 --> 25:00.125
Amen.

25:00.458 --> 25:01.458
God rest his soul.

25:15.916 --> 25:16.916
Where's-

25:16.916 --> 25:18.291
-he's dead.

25:18.291 --> 25:19.750
He's new.

25:21.750 --> 25:22.750
Huddle around.

25:29.166 --> 25:33.291
Sir, the shortest route is to stay
here on the shit side of the City...

25:33.291 --> 25:37.250
...head north, get attacked 50
times before we make it a mile.

25:37.250 --> 25:42.125
Or we can try to bribe our way to the safe
side of the City through this checkpoint here.

25:42.333 --> 25:44.083
Both sound lovely.

25:45.291 --> 25:46.750
But let's do the checkpoint.

25:46.750 --> 25:48.250
It's safer.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.583
But not for you.

25:49.875 --> 25:53.416
Yes for me too: court martial is still preferable to death.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.250
I think.

25:55.375 --> 25:57.875
Move. I'm the lead vehicle.

25:58.875 --> 26:01.208
Kawa, you're with us.

26:01.208 --> 26:02.208
Bribe who?

26:26.208 --> 26:28.041
Razak, quicker.

26:28.041 --> 26:30.000
A bit quicker.

26:33.916 --> 26:39.833
Hey infidels, the soldiers of the
Islamic State are still everywhere.

26:39.833 --> 26:43.333
We will remain and expand.

26:43.333 --> 26:46.875
We will cut your heads off.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.458
Your supporters are the Agents of the Cross.

26:49.458 --> 26:52.375
Your women will be ours.

26:52.375 --> 26:55.875
And your children, cubs of the caliphate. God willing.

26:56.458 --> 27:00.500
Fuck you and your so called "state." Son of a bitch.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.541
We're the ones coming for you.

27:18.458 --> 27:20.416
Let's pick up these children.

27:20.416 --> 27:22.375
Stop the car. Stop the car.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.583
Come with us.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.250
We're crossing over.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.583
Come on dears, come with us.

27:36.583 --> 27:37.708
Come with us.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.875
We're not strangers. Come with us.

27:41.208 --> 27:44.125
We can't leave. I promised my Dad.

27:44.125 --> 27:45.166
Where is he?

27:51.916 --> 27:55.333
Don't worry. We can rebuild everything.

27:55.333 --> 27:58.541
We just have to kill them all first.

27:58.541 --> 28:00.750
No. I promised.

28:01.125 --> 28:01.958
Should we?

28:01.958 --> 28:03.666
You promised Dad too!

28:03.666 --> 28:05.333
Mom was bleeding.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.708
So you just lie to them?
They didn't teach you better?

28:07.708 --> 28:10.708
They taught me to look out for my brother!
What'd they teach you?

28:10.708 --> 28:11.916
They taught me to keep my word.

28:11.916 --> 28:14.666
Who will bury them if we don't?

28:14.666 --> 28:16.916
We can help you dig. Just come with us.

28:16.916 --> 28:18.916
Sir please, we don't have time.

28:18.916 --> 28:20.375
They're children. Wait!

28:20.375 --> 28:23.500
Sir, can't we just grab these little guys?

28:23.500 --> 28:25.208
This is not a place to stop and talk.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.041
I'm going with them!

28:28.000 --> 28:29.500
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

28:30.333 --> 28:33.583
If you go, we'll each be alone.

28:34.250 --> 28:37.333
Come with me. Come with me. Come with me.

28:37.583 --> 28:38.916
Calm down Waleed.

28:38.916 --> 28:41.250
Sir, please, we don't have time.

28:41.250 --> 28:42.541
Give me a second!

28:42.541 --> 28:43.583
Come on dear.

28:54.416 --> 28:55.416
You coming or not?

29:01.833 --> 29:03.166
I promised my Dad.

30:43.958 --> 30:45.833
We are the Federal Police.

30:45.833 --> 30:47.083
I know.

30:47.083 --> 30:51.125
You never saw us, or the two
vehicles right behind. Got it?

31:19.750 --> 31:22.166
Guys, take care of his body.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.833
Why are we bribing Federal Police to
cross back to our side of the City?

31:54.833 --> 31:59.375
None of us knows anything about you pretty boy.
Except that your partner was a fucking traitor.

31:59.375 --> 32:00.791
You keep asking questions-

32:01.375 --> 32:03.250
-like why are we bribing our own?

32:03.250 --> 32:04.500
Yeah, and it won't end well.

32:04.500 --> 32:06.708
Shut up. Pray.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.791
Peace be upon you.

32:19.791 --> 32:20.833
And upon you.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.750
I see you are a family man.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.458
I have a small request.

32:26.458 --> 32:28.666
I found this kid on the other side.

32:28.666 --> 32:30.791
I'd like for you to take care of him.

32:30.791 --> 32:32.416
He lost his mom...

32:42.208 --> 32:43.208
I can't.

32:44.000 --> 32:44.833
Sorry.

32:44.833 --> 32:47.583
He needs a family, you have a family. Please keep him.

32:48.250 --> 32:50.458
Of course we will keep him with us.

32:50.458 --> 32:52.250
God bless you sister.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.291
Grow up to be good.

32:57.291 --> 33:03.833
If you leave him with the Red Crescent, I'll know.

33:11.458 --> 33:12.791
My love, are you hurt?

33:13.708 --> 33:14.708
Does it hurt you?

33:16.041 --> 33:17.416
Come here, come.

33:33.958 --> 33:34.958
SWAT?

33:35.208 --> 33:37.000
You're still alive?!

33:37.625 --> 33:39.750
Command has been looking all over for you!

33:40.500 --> 33:41.625
Are you okay?

33:41.625 --> 33:42.666
Don't worry about him.

33:43.083 --> 33:43.708
Keep moving.

33:43.708 --> 33:44.541
Don't touch me!

33:44.541 --> 33:45.333
Keep moving!

33:45.333 --> 33:46.041
Don't touch me!

33:46.875 --> 33:48.375
Do you guys hear me?

33:50.541 --> 33:52.541
Hey! What's wrong with you?

33:55.500 --> 33:57.458
You've heard the stories about us?

33:58.583 --> 33:59.416
Yes.

33:59.416 --> 34:00.750
They're all true.

34:02.291 --> 34:04.541
If you tell anybody you saw us...

34:05.833 --> 34:07.416
...I'll know it was you.

34:08.916 --> 34:09.916
Got it?

34:15.458 --> 34:16.583
Let's move, boys.

34:36.416 --> 34:37.833
Hey SWAT?

34:37.833 --> 34:42.250
We see you driving round the City.
What are you looking for?

34:45.000 --> 34:49.958
You used to have 6 Humvees, now it's 3.

34:49.958 --> 34:53.250
Couple months ago you had 9.

34:53.250 --> 34:56.541
You are the infidels and the apostates.

34:56.541 --> 35:00.750
You have lovely homes with comfortable beds.
Thanks for leaving them to us.

35:05.083 --> 35:07.541
We are not picking up ammo?

35:07.541 --> 35:08.541
Or food?

35:10.291 --> 35:11.291
Why not?

35:12.458 --> 35:14.958
Why when I ask a question no one answers?

35:17.250 --> 35:19.625
What are you running from?
Really. What are you running from?

35:19.625 --> 35:20.791
WE.

35:20.791 --> 35:23.000
What are WE running from.

35:26.083 --> 35:27.083
Where's the borek?

35:27.541 --> 35:28.541
I ate it.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.041
You finished it?

35:31.041 --> 35:31.958
Yeah.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.458
You should have shared with Razak or Waleed.

35:34.583 --> 35:35.583
I got hungry.

35:35.750 --> 35:36.958
You'll eat me next.

36:00.291 --> 36:03.208
I used to be a Homicide Detective.

36:04.541 --> 36:05.833
I know.

36:06.958 --> 36:09.458
I was studying to be a detective.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.458
You taught my evidence class.

36:13.625 --> 36:16.583
You were in one of my evidence classes?

36:16.583 --> 36:19.250
I knew I made a big impression.

36:20.833 --> 36:22.041
Sorry.

36:25.875 --> 36:28.041
Feels like many lifetimes ago.

36:29.541 --> 36:31.208
I used to love my work.

36:31.208 --> 36:34.166
Teaching?

36:34.666 --> 36:36.541
Being a Detective.

36:38.666 --> 36:43.666
I was really good at it.
Probably why I loved it so much.

36:45.208 --> 36:48.000
I liked who I was.

36:51.708 --> 36:53.375
You can go back to it, Sir.

36:56.541 --> 36:58.916
I can never go back to it.

37:16.958 --> 37:19.166
We're the good guys.

37:19.666 --> 37:20.875
What?

37:21.916 --> 37:23.250
We're the good guys.

37:23.875 --> 37:29.416
Listen carefully, the checkpoint was the
last time you put a hand on me.

37:31.958 --> 37:35.375
If you stopped asking questions,
I wouldn't have shoved you.

37:35.375 --> 37:39.750
I'm not a donkey to be pushed around or yelled at.

37:40.375 --> 37:41.583
Explain things to me.

37:41.583 --> 37:43.958
I don't know where we're going.
I don't know what our mission is.

37:43.958 --> 37:45.666
I don't know you. I don't know any of you.

37:45.666 --> 37:47.250
Why would I listen to you?

37:49.750 --> 37:50.750
Understand?

37:51.458 --> 37:52.458
Give me that.

37:55.666 --> 37:57.125
His brother.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.416
He'd force himself to watch this video.

38:01.416 --> 38:04.958
Whenever he had second thoughts
about what we were doing.

38:04.958 --> 38:08.125
Who we were fighting, and why.

38:10.625 --> 38:14.916
All the pictures he took were
proof that he did his part.

38:14.916 --> 38:16.750
Pictures he could show his family.

38:17.333 --> 38:20.125
Most of them are cops or soldiers.

38:31.333 --> 38:34.291
So that's what you're doing? You're taking vengeance?

38:41.500 --> 38:45.041
100 to 150 civilians headed this way...

38:45.041 --> 38:46.791
Windows up.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.625
We're about to cross back into the shit.

39:06.625 --> 39:07.666
Keep your eyes open guys.

39:35.625 --> 39:36.625
Watch it.

39:55.750 --> 39:56.791
Stop! Stop!

39:56.791 --> 39:58.166
They're shooting civilians!

40:00.333 --> 40:01.666
Why are they shooting them?

40:01.666 --> 40:03.958
Punishing them for leaving.

40:03.958 --> 40:06.291
They want to keep them as human shields.

40:07.458 --> 40:08.750
Where are they shooting from?

40:09.583 --> 40:11.708
People are falling before we hear the shots!

40:14.625 --> 40:15.708
I can't see Sir.

40:15.708 --> 40:16.875
To the left! To the left!

40:22.791 --> 40:25.541
Take cover behind the vehicles!

40:33.916 --> 40:35.791
One o'clock! One o'clock!

40:38.083 --> 40:40.041
Go back! Go back! You're in a minefield!

40:46.166 --> 40:47.208
Akram, Youness.

40:47.375 --> 40:51.166
Stay here and protect the people.
Shoot at the rooftop to the right!

40:51.166 --> 40:53.083
Don't stop until I tell you to.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.458
Razak move!

41:03.833 --> 41:05.083
Fuck this!

41:05.083 --> 41:06.291
Thaer my Son!

41:06.875 --> 41:07.875
Fuck our luck!

41:08.875 --> 41:09.875
Fuck our luck!

41:17.333 --> 41:19.000
Wait until they reload.

41:20.375 --> 41:22.208
Stop! Stop!

41:22.625 --> 41:24.291
Razak, stay here and wait for the others.

41:24.291 --> 41:25.875
Waleed, Kawa let's go.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.416
Now?

41:52.291 --> 41:53.291
Clear.

41:54.333 --> 41:55.833
Clear.

41:59.625 --> 42:00.666
All clear guys.

42:01.000 --> 42:02.000
Move down the street.

42:02.000 --> 42:04.041
Stay on the side road, not the main one.

42:04.041 --> 42:05.625
Razak is waiting. Move.

42:06.125 --> 42:07.333
Son of a bitch.

42:07.333 --> 42:09.500
Fuck you and everything you stood for.

42:23.958 --> 42:27.083
Be careful Waleed.

42:30.208 --> 42:32.083
Stay away from the wall.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.541
This one's better.

42:49.791 --> 42:51.333
Do you see it from here?

42:52.458 --> 42:53.791
Not yet, Sir.

43:15.791 --> 43:17.250
To the left. To the left.

43:17.250 --> 43:18.083
Where?

43:18.083 --> 43:20.583
Blue satellite. About 2 kilometers...

43:26.375 --> 43:27.500
We're really close.

43:36.791 --> 43:41.500
Drive the Humvees to the closest
point, then continue on foot.

43:48.708 --> 43:52.708
We need to cross through here,
but this route is dangerous.

43:52.708 --> 43:55.750
It's easy for them to ambush us
because of the narrow alleys.

43:55.750 --> 44:01.000
When we were kids we'd throw rocks at the
Americans, then use the alleys to escape.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.416
They're narrower than Humvees,
so they couldn't chase us.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.416
Let him suffer.

45:50.416 --> 45:51.416
What?

45:51.416 --> 45:52.791
Leave him.

46:25.625 --> 46:26.625
Amir.

46:27.625 --> 46:29.083
Take up a sniper position.

46:29.083 --> 46:30.791
On this side, got it?

46:31.750 --> 46:34.041
Razak, Akram and Youness...

46:34.416 --> 46:35.458
Yes, Sir?

46:35.458 --> 46:38.000
Go to Waleed. He's going to walk
you through how we get there.

46:54.208 --> 46:56.750
...there are tight alleys the Humvees can't pass through.

46:56.750 --> 47:01.958
We'll have to be on foot. It's going to be rough.

47:02.791 --> 47:04.791
Get me the hammer from my bag.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.083
What's your name?

47:25.083 --> 47:27.041
Amir. And you're Kawa?

47:27.291 --> 47:28.291
Yeah.

47:28.625 --> 47:29.625
Good to meet you.

47:30.791 --> 47:31.916
Good to meet you too.

47:34.666 --> 47:35.833
Fuck!

47:36.625 --> 47:37.625
Sir?

47:38.416 --> 47:39.541
Please come look.

47:41.250 --> 47:42.458
Sorry Sir, but please look.

47:43.833 --> 47:44.458
What's wrong?

47:53.041 --> 47:57.375
Between the pink building and
the parking lot on the left...

48:00.166 --> 48:01.375
See it?

48:08.291 --> 48:11.958
Do you think that's one of their bases?

48:19.375 --> 48:20.375
Yes.

48:23.250 --> 48:25.250
We could try to call in artillery.

48:25.250 --> 48:26.125
No I can't.

48:27.000 --> 48:29.208
Our people would deny the request...

48:29.208 --> 48:32.458
...scrap our mission, and throw me
in jail. You should know this.

48:33.666 --> 48:36.166
I could call my buddy at the Joint Operations Center...

48:36.166 --> 48:38.958
...give him this grid, see if the Americans could airstrike?

48:38.958 --> 48:39.833
No.

48:39.833 --> 48:40.875
I grew up with him.

48:40.875 --> 48:41.916
I said no.

48:42.333 --> 48:46.125
They flatten everything because they
don't have to rebuild anything.

48:46.125 --> 48:49.833
Don't talk about the Americans
anymore. We're past that.

48:52.041 --> 48:56.500
If we attack what looks like an enemy base...

48:57.916 --> 48:59.541
...we'll have to assault it ourselves.

49:00.541 --> 49:01.250
10 Men.

49:04.416 --> 49:05.625
It's your decision.

49:10.916 --> 49:12.875
Sir, you're our Commander, not me.

49:12.875 --> 49:14.708
Why are you putting this on me?

49:14.708 --> 49:15.708
Because I'm tired.

49:15.708 --> 49:17.791
These are 10 Men. And I'm tired too.

49:18.583 --> 49:20.041
I'm tired too, Sir.

49:20.041 --> 49:22.000
In two hours I've lost two of my sons.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.791
In two hours I've lost two of my brothers.

49:24.166 --> 49:25.250
We all lost them, Sir.

49:25.250 --> 49:25.875
Waleed!

49:25.875 --> 49:26.625
Sir!

49:26.625 --> 49:27.083
Waleed!

49:27.083 --> 49:28.166
Don't shout Sir!

49:30.083 --> 49:32.375
Do we wipe that base out?

49:32.541 --> 49:35.791
So we can stop worrying
about what's right behind us?

49:35.791 --> 49:39.041
Or do we bypass it and try
to stay unseen and unheard?

49:39.041 --> 49:40.541
Sir, I beg you.

49:41.166 --> 49:43.041
Waleed! You pick!

49:43.541 --> 49:45.041
These are 10 Men.

49:45.375 --> 49:46.625
Making them my...

49:56.541 --> 49:57.791
I say we can go around it...

49:58.875 --> 50:00.375
...we can stay unnoticed.

50:04.125 --> 50:05.291
Anyone see it?

50:06.416 --> 50:07.458
Spot it?

50:09.416 --> 50:10.750
Call it if you see it.

50:11.041 --> 50:12.250
No one fires.

50:13.458 --> 50:14.541
We need every bullet.

50:15.916 --> 50:16.916
Take cover!

50:23.625 --> 50:25.083
That was C4 or PETN.

50:28.333 --> 50:29.500
You okay?

50:38.541 --> 50:41.208
Sir, one of our Humvees is gone!

51:11.333 --> 51:13.833
DHL will deliver anywhere.

51:14.458 --> 51:15.833
Barter?

51:16.541 --> 51:18.000
For what?

51:18.583 --> 51:20.083
7.62

51:20.541 --> 51:21.750
Sorry. Shooting 5-5-6.

51:23.125 --> 51:28.375
An Iranian Special Forces Colonel, in Iraq,
using an American rifle, firing NATO ammo?

51:28.791 --> 51:30.583
Crazy world.

51:30.791 --> 51:32.166
Someone should sell tickets.

51:35.250 --> 51:38.833
We still have some boxes
of 7.62, just in case.

51:39.916 --> 51:41.833
I believe in contingencies.

51:41.833 --> 51:43.250
What do you need?

51:44.208 --> 51:45.208
Cigarettes.

51:45.791 --> 51:46.791
Those we have.

51:47.958 --> 51:51.833
Nicotine and bullets bring the world together.

51:51.833 --> 51:54.041
Meet me right in front of our building.

51:54.041 --> 51:55.458
Okay.

51:56.625 --> 51:59.666
Stay low and get down to the street. Fast.

51:59.666 --> 52:01.625
Amir, Kawa, let's go.

52:10.083 --> 52:12.041
Leave him. Let him suffer.

52:43.500 --> 52:44.500
Get your hands off me!

52:44.500 --> 52:45.583
Calm down, calm down...

52:46.333 --> 52:48.708
Just the one the Colonel was talking to.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.208
Are you stupid?

52:51.625 --> 52:53.291
Sir, Kamal and I can't let you go alone.

52:55.083 --> 52:57.250
Waleed, we have no choice.

53:00.250 --> 53:03.083
Take care, I won't be long.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.875
Peace be upon you.

53:14.875 --> 53:16.833
And upon you. Welcome.

53:29.333 --> 53:30.875
What?

53:31.041 --> 53:34.375
Have you never been this close to
a Popular Mobilization Force?

53:36.416 --> 53:38.166
I've been this close to many.

53:38.166 --> 53:40.291
I've even fought alongside a few.

53:41.208 --> 53:46.875
But I've always kept my distance
from your particular group.

53:47.125 --> 53:49.458
It's a pleasure to meet you too.

53:49.458 --> 53:50.833
I'm Colonel Isfahani.

53:50.833 --> 53:53.208
What brings you to our part of the City?

53:53.208 --> 53:55.500
I was born in this part of the City.

53:55.500 --> 53:58.208
I'll guess most of your Men were too.

53:58.208 --> 54:02.833
The better question is why are you here?
Such a long way from your family?

54:02.833 --> 54:04.166
Logistical support.

54:04.166 --> 54:05.125
Logistics.

54:05.125 --> 54:06.250
Indeed.

54:06.708 --> 54:07.958
How many cartons is that?

54:07.958 --> 54:09.583
13 Cartons.

54:10.041 --> 54:12.291
Did you guys hijack a truck?

54:13.666 --> 54:16.916
Looks like maybe one carton
for each of your men.

54:17.541 --> 54:19.750
We're not all equal.

54:20.208 --> 54:21.166
Tea?

54:21.166 --> 54:22.416
No thanks.

54:22.416 --> 54:24.458
Please have some tea.

54:24.458 --> 54:26.541
Let's make it quick.

54:29.583 --> 54:32.000
What are you doing?
Keep your eyes on the street.

54:32.333 --> 54:35.166
You let him go down there without his weapon?

54:35.541 --> 54:37.000
Jasem's a wolf.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.208
Don't worry about him.

54:39.083 --> 54:40.500
Waleed was worried.

54:40.583 --> 54:42.291
Waleed has his reasons.

54:42.291 --> 54:43.791
Focus on your role.

54:44.750 --> 54:47.166
3 cartons for each box-

54:47.166 --> 54:48.583
-1 carton for 1 box.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.750
Make it quick.

54:55.375 --> 54:57.250
You're SWAT...

54:57.250 --> 55:00.208
...so I assume you were all police once?

55:00.208 --> 55:01.750
We still are Police.

55:01.750 --> 55:02.916
And you are from this City?

55:02.916 --> 55:05.250
I told you: born and raised.

55:06.291 --> 55:09.666
Okay. One box for one carton...

55:09.666 --> 55:13.875
...you take a look at our prisoners
to see if you can identify any?

55:14.083 --> 55:15.041
Deal?

55:15.041 --> 55:16.708
Deal. Let's go.

55:21.916 --> 55:24.375
Finally some cigs.

55:24.375 --> 55:25.541
I don't know him.

55:27.541 --> 55:28.666
I don't know him.

55:31.208 --> 55:33.000
Kawa get down here right now!

55:46.625 --> 55:48.625
Kawa! Get in here right now!

55:49.083 --> 55:50.458
This is your partner, isn't it?

55:58.500 --> 55:59.625
That's him.

56:03.333 --> 56:07.166
I knew you wouldn't still be in the cafe...

56:07.708 --> 56:08.708
...I knew you wouldn't.

56:09.208 --> 56:14.708
Colonel, let me take him.
He gave us away to Daesh.

56:15.583 --> 56:16.750
So we don't have a problem.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.250
No.

56:21.166 --> 56:22.791
I screamed...

56:23.625 --> 56:25.000
They beat me!

56:27.041 --> 56:34.500
Told me if I didn't show them your position,
they would find my family in America.

56:37.916 --> 56:38.833
He's ours.

56:40.625 --> 56:41.666
Don't hit him.

56:41.958 --> 56:44.041
Don't hit him like that again.

56:44.333 --> 56:45.541
He's ours.

56:45.541 --> 56:46.250
No.

56:46.250 --> 56:47.708
They took my phone.

56:49.291 --> 56:52.708
They found my grandson in Michigan, on Facebook.

56:52.708 --> 56:55.333
...there was no additional quid pro quo
if you did actually identify a face.

56:55.333 --> 56:57.416
I looked around for you, to try to see you-

56:57.416 --> 57:01.375
-you didn't. I saw you throw the flare and run.

57:01.500 --> 57:02.916
If it were me I'd give him to you.

57:02.916 --> 57:04.666
You're not me.

57:04.666 --> 57:07.000
That's right: I'm an Iraqi in Iraq.

57:08.083 --> 57:10.541
You're Iraqis too - or have you forgotten?

57:10.541 --> 57:13.125
And what a wonderful job of
stewardship you've done here.

57:13.208 --> 57:14.583
I'm not the enemy!

57:14.583 --> 57:15.375
It's always darkest before the dawn.

57:15.375 --> 57:16.791
It's always darkest before the dawn.
I'm not the enemy!

57:16.791 --> 57:17.333
The dawn of what?

57:17.333 --> 57:18.750
The dawn of what?
Check your list again!

57:19.000 --> 57:20.416
I'm not the enemy! Check your list!

57:20.500 --> 57:24.875
An Iraq without Sadaam, the West,
Terrorists, or an Iranian Colonel.

57:24.958 --> 57:29.000
Without us, you'll curse yourselves
with something or someone else.

57:31.250 --> 57:32.166
You know why?

57:32.166 --> 57:34.458
I'm sure you'll tell me.

57:34.458 --> 57:39.125
Because you're not a real country.
You haven't been since Babylon.

57:39.125 --> 57:43.916
You were created by a drunk British dilettante
and a French bureaucrat with inaccurate maps.

57:43.916 --> 57:48.250
And you by angry children who took hostages.

57:48.250 --> 57:49.500
Fuck you all!

57:49.500 --> 57:53.375
You'll break into at least three
pieces once we finish off Daesh.

57:53.375 --> 57:54.583
That shouldn't be hard now!

57:54.583 --> 57:58.541
After the 3 years we've spent killing
their toughest and best Fighters!

57:58.541 --> 58:01.416
What part of those 3 years were
spent running from them?

58:01.416 --> 58:05.125
Iraqi Army rifle for sale, never
been fired, only dropped once.

58:05.125 --> 58:07.416
You got the wrong Unit, Colonel!

58:07.416 --> 58:12.375
Fuck you all! I have killed more
enemies than all of you!

58:12.375 --> 58:15.291
All I've ever known is war!

58:15.291 --> 58:17.541
So both of you can go fuck yourselves!

58:17.541 --> 58:20.458
Iranian, Kuwaiti, American, Al Qaeda-

58:20.458 --> 58:21.291
-shut up!

58:21.291 --> 58:22.291
Shut up!

58:22.750 --> 58:23.750
Shut up!

58:24.875 --> 58:25.916
Is that a challenge?

58:26.041 --> 58:28.083
I'm not the enemy! I'm not the en-

59:16.250 --> 59:18.041
Okay...

59:18.041 --> 59:20.625
...one box for one carton.

59:39.416 --> 59:40.416
Chill...

59:41.041 --> 59:42.083
Calm down.

59:43.166 --> 59:45.166
Sinan, take two boxes.

59:46.791 --> 59:49.458
This used to belong to our friend...

59:51.250 --> 59:53.291
Trade this for your RPG?

59:55.083 --> 59:56.291
What's happening here?

59:56.458 --> 59:58.208
A hookah for the RPG.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:03.041
Fine. Just the one rocket though.

1:00:05.125 --> 1:00:06.541
Why'd you do that?

1:00:07.291 --> 1:00:10.791
We need more than bullets to wipe out that base.

1:00:10.791 --> 1:00:13.791
I was wrong before. We can't leave it behind us.

1:00:15.625 --> 1:00:18.416
I told you, it's your call. Move.

1:00:49.708 --> 1:00:56.041
The reason we can't go back for ammo,
or call in artillery strikes...

1:00:57.625 --> 1:01:00.791
...or sleep on mattresses on the safe side of the City...

1:01:00.791 --> 1:01:03.000
...is because we're disobeying orders.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.333
Disobeying 'new' orders I should say.

1:01:06.833 --> 1:01:10.625
A month ago, we were given a mission.

1:01:10.625 --> 1:01:14.625
A mission we all wanted.
A mission I planned.

1:01:16.291 --> 1:01:20.500
Two weeks later, we were put under
a new Army Command.

1:01:20.500 --> 1:01:22.541
And that Command scrapped our mission...

1:01:22.541 --> 1:01:26.833
...and tried to send us to a village miles
from here. Miles from our fight.

1:01:26.833 --> 1:01:29.750
So we stopped taking their calls.

1:01:30.875 --> 1:01:33.000
And kept on with our old mission, which is to-

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.000
-I don't need to know anymore.

1:01:36.208 --> 1:01:38.208
Don't want to know.

1:01:38.458 --> 1:01:44.291
Tell me what I need to know when
I need to know it and I'll do it.

1:01:46.083 --> 1:01:48.666
Whatever it is.

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:51.833
Razak, end of the line.

1:03:00.333 --> 1:03:01.500
I don't like this.

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:35.208
No!

1:03:45.541 --> 1:03:47.541
RPG! RPG!

1:03:47.541 --> 1:03:49.416
No! It's not for this!

1:04:03.625 --> 1:04:04.666
Get down!

1:04:14.375 --> 1:04:16.375
We got them! Blew their heads off!

1:04:16.375 --> 1:04:17.458
Kawa's injured!

1:04:17.458 --> 1:04:18.458
Youness!

1:04:18.750 --> 1:04:19.375
Youness!

1:04:22.208 --> 1:04:23.333
Be careful.

1:04:25.666 --> 1:04:26.416
Clear!

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:35.750
Waleed, hold him.

1:04:35.750 --> 1:04:37.000
Kawa.

1:04:37.958 --> 1:04:39.083
Can you hear me?

1:04:57.333 --> 1:04:58.666
I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

1:04:59.041 --> 1:05:01.541
They were firing at us.
I had to throw the grenade.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:04.875
I swear to God I didn't see him. He ran in front.

1:05:06.250 --> 1:05:09.083
I got something.

1:05:12.041 --> 1:05:13.375
God rest your soul, Youness.

1:05:18.875 --> 1:05:20.750
Enough. Enough.

1:05:28.458 --> 1:05:29.875
Is his injury bad?

1:05:31.208 --> 1:05:33.125
Ugly gash.

1:05:33.125 --> 1:05:35.291
How many fingers?

1:05:35.291 --> 1:05:36.291
Three.

1:05:36.291 --> 1:05:38.166
Let's go champ. Let's go.

1:05:38.416 --> 1:05:40.208
Let's go guys. Get your weapons.

1:07:04.041 --> 1:07:07.375
May God bless you, keep you safe.

1:07:08.916 --> 1:07:10.125
Cigarettes? Cigarettes?

1:07:11.666 --> 1:07:13.750
I just want a cigarette.

1:08:24.291 --> 1:08:25.125
You okay?

1:08:25.125 --> 1:08:26.583
It's a small injury.

1:08:26.583 --> 1:08:27.625
Everyone okay?

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.083
Razak?

1:08:30.083 --> 1:08:31.083
Clear!

1:08:39.791 --> 1:08:40.833
Razak is dead.

1:08:50.250 --> 1:08:51.791
Pick up his ammo and let's move.

1:09:01.333 --> 1:09:03.291
Fuck you, you son of a bitch.

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:24.375
Guys, Sinan is bleeding.

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:28.041
We need to get going.

1:09:30.333 --> 1:09:31.416
Kamal?

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.083
How's Sinan?

1:09:33.583 --> 1:09:34.666
He's okay Jasem.

1:09:36.625 --> 1:09:37.666
Make it quick.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.041
It's dangerous here.

1:09:39.291 --> 1:09:40.583
We need to get going.

1:09:42.708 --> 1:09:44.083
Sinan are you okay?

1:09:44.083 --> 1:09:45.083
I'm okay.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:47.541
Kamal, make it quick.

1:09:49.333 --> 1:09:51.833
We're close to their base. Work quickly.

1:09:55.750 --> 1:09:57.041
We're in the open Kamal.

1:09:58.083 --> 1:09:59.416
Guys, he's injured!

1:10:13.625 --> 1:10:15.125
Let's get moving guys.

1:10:39.666 --> 1:10:40.958
Stop right here, Sir.

1:10:44.208 --> 1:10:47.833
Their base is on the other side of these buildings.

1:10:48.750 --> 1:10:50.250
We're real close.

1:11:00.250 --> 1:11:01.291
Waleed, come with me.

1:11:02.208 --> 1:11:04.458
Everyone else hold here.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:40.958
Look at these fools.

1:11:42.458 --> 1:11:45.833
Loading up ammo and money out in the open.

1:11:48.333 --> 1:11:50.125
Seems like they are running away.

1:11:50.125 --> 1:11:52.250
Who cares if they're running, Sir?

1:11:52.666 --> 1:11:53.875
So we attack?

1:11:53.875 --> 1:11:55.083
Yes, we attack.

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:22.000
Alright, this is how we're going to do this...

1:12:43.875 --> 1:12:44.958
It's a dud! It's a dud!

1:12:45.041 --> 1:12:48.583
Dud! Dud! Move and I will cover you!

1:13:21.416 --> 1:13:23.208
Waleed go down!

1:13:45.958 --> 1:13:49.166
Breathe. Breathe.

1:13:49.166 --> 1:13:51.958
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

1:14:03.833 --> 1:14:06.125
Kamal, move next to Sinan.

1:14:06.916 --> 1:14:07.458
Akram?

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:09.458
He's dead, Sir.

1:14:09.458 --> 1:14:11.125
May he rest in peace. Get moving.

1:14:11.541 --> 1:14:13.583
Listen, listen.

1:14:13.583 --> 1:14:15.541
Kamal, go through the opening on the right.

1:14:15.541 --> 1:14:17.041
Secure the area.

1:14:17.041 --> 1:14:19.583
Kawa, Waleed you're with me.

1:15:35.750 --> 1:15:36.750
Clear?

1:15:47.375 --> 1:15:48.375
Clear?

1:15:48.875 --> 1:15:50.125
Clear!

1:16:05.375 --> 1:16:06.750
Guys, everyone okay?

1:16:08.958 --> 1:16:10.625
We got 90 seconds.

1:16:10.625 --> 1:16:14.583
Stay alert. There might be more.

1:16:14.583 --> 1:16:18.250
Reload, hydrate, then we finish.

1:16:26.041 --> 1:16:27.416
Take some water for the team.

1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:29.291
Is everyone okay, Sir?

1:16:29.375 --> 1:16:31.875
Amir, you stay there and cover that side.

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.916
We got 90 seconds.

1:16:49.708 --> 1:16:50.750
Kamal?

1:16:51.666 --> 1:16:52.583
What?

1:16:52.583 --> 1:16:53.916
Tramadol, can he use it?

1:16:54.375 --> 1:16:55.375
Yes he can.

1:16:55.375 --> 1:16:56.791
Sinan...

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.875
Everything about them is empty.

1:17:32.500 --> 1:17:33.666
Sinan can you move?

1:18:02.541 --> 1:18:03.541
Sir!

1:19:06.500 --> 1:19:08.500
90 seconds is up.

1:19:08.500 --> 1:19:11.375
We can come back for all our dead,
but 90 seconds is up.

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:13.250
Do you even know where we're going?

1:19:13.625 --> 1:19:15.458
What we've been doing?

1:19:16.583 --> 1:19:18.125
Who are you?

1:19:18.416 --> 1:19:20.333
I'm one of you.

1:19:21.083 --> 1:19:22.291
I know.

1:19:22.958 --> 1:19:25.500
I know it has to add up to
something more than all this.

1:19:26.166 --> 1:19:30.166
Or none of you would still be
doing this, fighting like this.

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:34.916
Suffering like this on the shit side of the
City if it wasn't for something bigger.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:37.208
We must move.

1:19:40.750 --> 1:19:42.750
He's right.

1:19:46.208 --> 1:19:50.083
There are six of us. We can finish the mission.

1:19:51.750 --> 1:19:53.250
Or all die.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:56.958
What are you saying?

1:19:57.875 --> 1:19:59.791
Our plan is fucked!

1:20:00.250 --> 1:20:01.708
Major Jasem was everything to us.

1:20:01.708 --> 1:20:03.041
Our plan is fucked!

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:06.041
Let's think of another way...

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:10.875
This is Major Jasem.

1:20:12.666 --> 1:20:14.291
Our Father.

1:20:19.875 --> 1:20:21.958
Without him this will turn to shit.

1:20:21.958 --> 1:20:23.750
Waleed.

1:20:24.125 --> 1:20:27.500
It has already turned to shit hundreds of times.

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.666
And yet we're still here.

1:20:31.291 --> 1:20:33.250
Three blocks away, Brother.

1:20:34.041 --> 1:20:36.000
Three blocks.

1:20:57.291 --> 1:20:59.041
Two blocks, Kamal.

1:21:27.916 --> 1:21:29.291
The blue satellite...

1:22:03.125 --> 1:22:05.750
Stay on me. We're going up four flights.
Don't separate.

1:22:05.750 --> 1:22:08.250
Any man you see in this building should die.

1:22:08.833 --> 1:22:12.625
Only those with suppressors should shoot.
Everybody else try to use blades.

1:22:12.625 --> 1:22:14.083
Only fire if you need to.

1:22:23.583 --> 1:22:25.833
Radios off.

1:22:33.958 --> 1:22:35.291
Ready?

1:24:00.041 --> 1:24:01.041
Waleed.

1:24:01.541 --> 1:24:03.250
We're being seen. How do you want to do this?

1:24:30.208 --> 1:24:31.583
Waleed.

1:24:31.791 --> 1:24:34.083
Take a breath and calm down.

1:24:41.625 --> 1:24:42.833
Ready?

1:24:43.291 --> 1:24:44.333
One.

1:24:45.291 --> 1:24:46.250
Two.

1:24:46.250 --> 1:24:47.041
Waleed.

1:24:47.666 --> 1:24:48.750
Let Amir do it.

1:24:48.750 --> 1:24:51.375
No Kamal. I'll do it.

1:24:51.375 --> 1:24:52.625
Ready?

1:25:11.708 --> 1:25:13.333
Hayat it's me!

1:25:15.166 --> 1:25:17.250
Dunia, it's your Dad.

1:25:23.166 --> 1:25:24.125
Hayat...

1:25:24.125 --> 1:25:25.291
Waleed?

1:25:26.708 --> 1:25:28.000
Waleed!

1:25:32.291 --> 1:25:34.166
Where have you been?

1:25:36.208 --> 1:25:37.250
Daddy?

1:25:47.041 --> 1:25:49.500
I thought you were dead.

1:25:57.458 --> 1:25:59.458
I'm here with you.

1:26:15.625 --> 1:26:17.541
Where were you?

1:26:23.041 --> 1:26:25.333
Do you know how long you've been away?

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:47.791
Let me check your injury.

1:26:53.833 --> 1:26:55.583
I missed you so much.

1:27:03.500 --> 1:27:05.125
Does it add up to more?

1:27:10.666 --> 1:27:13.000
Are we doing this for everybody on the team?

1:27:14.125 --> 1:27:17.083
For those whose families weren't
murdered when the City fell.

1:27:24.375 --> 1:27:26.250
I'm pregnant.

1:27:45.083 --> 1:27:46.333
It's my fault.

1:27:48.708 --> 1:27:51.333
I couldn't come back for you.

1:27:52.125 --> 1:27:54.416
God knows I tried.

1:27:55.208 --> 1:27:56.375
I tried.

1:27:56.875 --> 1:27:59.500
I swear to God I couldn't get back to you.

1:28:02.750 --> 1:28:04.000
Why?

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.333
Jasem.

1:28:06.333 --> 1:28:08.708
This was all Major Jasem.

1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:12.458
Because the youngest have more
time to have more children.

1:28:12.458 --> 1:28:14.708
More children brings back our City faster.

1:28:35.625 --> 1:28:37.916
Amir's wife died.

1:28:38.791 --> 1:28:41.416
But his little boy is still alive.

1:28:42.375 --> 1:28:45.666
As of last week. We got information on him.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:51.791
Did Major Jasem have a family?

1:28:53.125 --> 1:28:55.000
Yes he did.

1:28:56.291 --> 1:29:02.291
Daesh knew who we were because we
had arrested so many of them before.

1:29:03.041 --> 1:29:07.708
They were all common criminals before
there ever was a Daesh to join.

1:29:07.708 --> 1:29:13.166
A man Jasem put in prison became
one of their Commanders.

1:29:13.166 --> 1:29:16.416
He found the Major's family...

1:29:25.750 --> 1:29:27.083
Pack your things.

1:29:35.916 --> 1:29:37.333
Why are you putting that on?

1:29:38.375 --> 1:29:40.458
You're not going to come with us?

1:29:47.583 --> 1:29:49.708
Don't be afraid.

1:29:51.625 --> 1:29:53.125
I'm with you.

1:29:53.791 --> 1:29:55.458
We don't have much time.

1:29:59.125 --> 1:30:01.416
We don't have much time my love.

1:30:56.208 --> 1:30:59.666
Do you know how much I love you?

1:31:51.041 --> 1:31:54.041
How far from here is your Son?
