WEBVTT

00:34.686 --> 00:35.818
Bring him here!

01:00.060 --> 01:02.018
Anyone hiding a member
of the resistance

01:02.105 --> 01:03.150
will pay the price.

01:07.763 --> 01:08.807
That's enough.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.123
Enough.
Get the men to the truck.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.385
What happened, General?

01:23.387 --> 01:25.085
- Do you hear that, Colonel?
-Yes.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.653
The fighting is getting closer.
We need to regroup.

01:29.263 --> 01:30.568
Unless you could
expedite things.

01:30.960 --> 01:33.876
I find that a good threat
motivates people.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.106
The family, monsieur.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.415
Mother, father and the child.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.203
Take them. Bring them down.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.335
Move! On your knees!

01:59.684 --> 02:00.598
Please, General!

02:00.859 --> 02:01.991
I promise you
that there are no resistance

02:02.426 --> 02:03.601
among any of us here!

02:09.825 --> 02:11.131
They think you're a fool.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.570
We grow tired
of your obstinance!

02:17.485 --> 02:19.182
Reveal the location
of the resistance

02:19.313 --> 02:21.402
or we will butcher this family
in the street!

02:23.143 --> 02:25.188
There is no one
hiding in this town.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.148
These are just simple,
good people.

02:35.067 --> 02:35.938
I know.

02:48.603 --> 02:49.604
Over there!

02:49.821 --> 02:51.432
Quickly now, quickly!

03:24.552 --> 03:25.640
Colonel, hold on.

03:26.771 --> 03:28.512
Goodbye, Ryder!

06:01.448 --> 06:02.362
Yeah?

06:08.759 --> 06:10.021
Can I help you?

06:10.195 --> 06:11.327
When did I check in?

06:11.675 --> 06:13.329
I don't know.
I just got on at 12:00.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.245
What's your room number?

06:28.039 --> 06:30.041
Yeah. I don't know, Mr. Ryder.

06:30.564 --> 06:31.478
It doesn't say.

06:36.613 --> 06:38.572
Goodbye, Ryder!

06:40.617 --> 06:41.488
Ryder?

06:45.230 --> 06:46.231
Are you okay?

06:47.668 --> 06:48.538
Hmm.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.848
<i>You know,
I look out over this city...</i>

07:39.328 --> 07:41.591
...and I realize I still feel
the same way I did

07:41.809 --> 07:43.027
when I was a child.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.289
How's that, boss?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.944
I always wanted
to tear things down.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.337
But, of course,

07:48.772 --> 07:50.731
there's no point
tearing anything down

07:51.645 --> 07:54.778
unless you can build
something better in its place.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.171
And so,

07:57.172 --> 07:58.260
I worked hard...

08:00.044 --> 08:03.352
made quite a nice living,
doing just that, didn't I, Jack?

08:03.787 --> 08:05.963
Yes, you made
a shitload of money.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.357
I have.
But something's wrong, Jack.

08:10.533 --> 08:12.579
I'm questioning myself.
Do I really need to spend

08:12.666 --> 08:16.496
the last years of my life
turning this into this?

08:17.366 --> 08:19.150
A lot of people
are going to get hurt, Jack,

08:19.237 --> 08:20.891
especially in the poor section.

08:21.022 --> 08:22.545
How often do I have to do
the same thing

08:22.632 --> 08:23.807
over and over again?

08:23.981 --> 08:25.069
It's like reincarnation.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.115
- Huh?
- You know, coming back

08:27.202 --> 08:28.682
and doing the same thing
over and over again.

08:28.856 --> 08:29.813
May I say,

08:30.248 --> 08:32.512
you're doing them all
a magnificent favor.

08:33.817 --> 08:34.905
It's progress.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.341
It can hurt.

08:36.951 --> 08:40.171
Sometimes a few have to suffer
to benefit the many.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.174
When all is said and done...

08:44.611 --> 08:46.700
your soul will be judged

08:46.830 --> 08:48.615
by the things
that you have accomplished.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.268
My soul?

08:51.008 --> 08:52.923
What are you talking about?
There is no soul.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.491
Well, then,
if there's no soul,

08:55.752 --> 08:57.058
you're doing exactly

08:57.145 --> 08:58.886
what you're supposed
to be doing, Paul.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.975
That's Mr. Sanborn to you.

09:01.279 --> 09:02.237
Relax, Jack.

09:03.194 --> 09:04.761
Mr. Soach is an artist.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.808
We make exceptions for artists.

09:07.895 --> 09:09.897
Nevertheless,

09:10.158 --> 09:13.335
something is bothering me
about this now.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.998
I could've chosen
a dozen other projects.

09:24.651 --> 09:25.826
I chose yours

09:26.522 --> 09:29.220
because it matters
for the people.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.355
You've been building
towards this your whole life.

09:33.616 --> 09:35.183
- Oh, well, I have.
-Yes.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.533
You've done other things before,
but this is...

09:38.316 --> 09:39.274
Wow.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.015
This is something else.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.974
- Well, this was the big one.
-This is huge.

09:44.148 --> 09:45.846
This is your Mount Everest.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.674
It is, isn't it?

09:48.022 --> 09:48.892
Yes!

09:49.763 --> 09:50.851
You said you had a vision.

09:55.595 --> 10:00.121
I came here to do one thing,
make that vision a reality.

10:00.251 --> 10:01.339
But let me ask you...

10:02.471 --> 10:05.126
do you still have the energy
to get this done?

10:07.128 --> 10:07.998
I do.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.087
Of course, I do.

10:10.479 --> 10:11.741
There will always be doubt.

10:12.046 --> 10:13.047
I know that.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.006
Of course,
and of course you're right.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.357
This is my work.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.623
Be assured that what we're doing
is a great thing.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.407
It is, isn't it?

10:26.582 --> 10:29.019
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:30.238 --> 10:32.370
I have a few little things
I need to accomplish.

10:43.599 --> 10:44.731
That is one weird dude.

10:44.905 --> 10:46.950
Well, he's a character.
I'll grant you that.

10:47.516 --> 10:49.910
But, Jack, that man is a genius.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.608
Yeah, he's still weird.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.219
Look, if you want
to get this thing built,

10:55.611 --> 10:56.873
you're still gonna have
to get it approved

10:56.960 --> 10:57.831
by city council.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.137
Roger Hammond's
the only one that matters.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.486
The rest are in my pocket.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.532
Maybe it's time
I gave Mr. Hammond a visit,

11:03.837 --> 11:05.099
showed him the error
of his ways.

11:05.186 --> 11:08.189
Jack, that's a little
heavy-handed.

11:09.103 --> 11:10.452
Just call his office.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.672
Set a meeting.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.123
I'm scared!

12:14.429 --> 12:15.517
What can I get you?

12:15.778 --> 12:16.648
Coffee.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.302
Kitchen open?

12:18.650 --> 12:19.913
You can have whatever you want

12:20.043 --> 12:21.871
as long as it's
a well-done cheeseburger.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.917
It's all we got
right now, sorry.

12:24.918 --> 12:25.788
Sounds good.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.834
Leo, get me a cheeseburger.

12:27.964 --> 12:28.791
Mm-hmm.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.235
-Thanks.
- Cream and sugar?

12:42.979 --> 12:43.980
Are you okay, hon?

12:47.288 --> 12:49.072
You're the second person today
who's asked me that.

12:49.594 --> 12:50.900
Well, what's the answer?

12:54.556 --> 12:55.557
I'm not sure.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
Empty this time of day, huh?

13:03.870 --> 13:05.610
Oh, it's just about happy hour.

13:06.176 --> 13:07.525
It'll get busy pretty soon.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.572
A little early.

13:12.530 --> 13:13.662
Not in this town.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.469
You need to be
more careful

13:38.556 --> 13:39.775
with your receipts, Shelly.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.780
I do my grandmother's books.

13:45.085 --> 13:47.478
Morgan is afraid
I'll screw up my taxes

13:47.565 --> 13:49.698
and the IRS will take
all this away.

13:55.138 --> 13:55.965
Hello, Shelly.

13:56.574 --> 13:57.445
Jack.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.316
Whiskey.

14:25.212 --> 14:26.082
It look good.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.302
Bud...

14:29.477 --> 14:31.087
don't be rude, pay the lady.

14:38.616 --> 14:39.879
Get yourself something nice.

14:53.762 --> 14:54.676
Who's this?

15:00.247 --> 15:01.117
My name is Ryder.

15:15.262 --> 15:16.132
Mother...

15:17.699 --> 15:18.569
Ah!

15:24.227 --> 15:25.315
Let's go, Boss.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.403
Let's go.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.365
I'll see you next time, Shelly.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.062
Come on, Tink.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.462
Who's your friends?

15:41.897 --> 15:44.856
The big one is called Tink,
short for Tinkerbell.

15:45.901 --> 15:48.208
The skinny one's Bud,
short for...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.514
Nobody cares
what his real name is.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.388
They both work
for the other guy, Jack.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.172
You pay them protection?

15:57.478 --> 15:58.435
Not exactly.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.046
Ready.

16:03.832 --> 16:04.789
Hope you're hungry.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.357
Starving.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.316
You better be
if you're going to eat that.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.929
-Good burger.
- No, it's not.

16:14.147 --> 16:15.975
I must be hungry.
It tastes okay to me.

16:16.410 --> 16:17.933
When was the last time you ate?

16:19.413 --> 16:20.240
I don't know.

16:22.459 --> 16:23.504
Can I ask you a question?

16:25.071 --> 16:27.899
Do you know anything
about a little girl...

16:32.904 --> 16:34.254
hurt or killed around here?

16:36.778 --> 16:38.475
Well, that's a strange question.

16:40.477 --> 16:41.348
What's the answer?

16:42.653 --> 16:43.959
The answer would be no.

16:45.526 --> 16:46.614
Why do you ask?

16:54.535 --> 16:55.623
Happy hour, huh?

16:56.754 --> 16:57.625
Happy hour.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.305
<i>Citizens...</i>

17:25.957 --> 17:27.263
lend me your attention here.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.048
Lend me your attention.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.312
This woman and this child
stand accused.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.530
Senator, these are lies.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.184
We're wrongfully accused.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.144
We have
evidence enough, Senator.

17:39.406 --> 17:42.148
Is there anyone willing
to fight for these two?

17:43.149 --> 17:46.500
If not, they will be dealt
with according to the law.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.156
Don't be frightened.

17:51.070 --> 17:51.983
It's gonna be all right.

17:52.767 --> 17:53.898
Someone will fight for us.

17:58.729 --> 17:59.948
Must you do this?

18:01.210 --> 18:02.429
I thought better of you.

18:04.387 --> 18:05.562
I will not watch.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.220
We must maintain
the law, Senator.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.189
The people will love you.

18:34.374 --> 18:37.507
Will anyone fight
for this woman and this child?

18:45.428 --> 18:46.255
Anyone?

18:46.908 --> 18:47.865
I will!

18:50.172 --> 18:51.913
Well, well, step forward.

18:52.261 --> 18:53.828
Show yourself to the people.

19:19.288 --> 19:20.855
Citizens, we have a game.

19:22.422 --> 19:23.553
We have a game.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.485
Hey. Hey!

19:47.142 --> 19:48.143
How do I know you?

19:52.756 --> 19:53.757
Now, that's funny.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.106
What is?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.244
I was going to ask you
the same thing.

20:12.123 --> 20:13.299
Detective Timmons.

20:14.822 --> 20:15.910
Good to see you.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.216
What seems to be the problem?

20:17.303 --> 20:18.173
Problem?

20:18.434 --> 20:19.914
Oh, there's no problem.

20:20.175 --> 20:21.089
There's no problem.

20:21.829 --> 20:22.786
We were just leaving.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.668
Let me see some I.D.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.541
You didn't ask those guys
for their I.D.

20:39.455 --> 20:40.630
I know who they are.

20:40.804 --> 20:41.979
And they know you too.

20:44.373 --> 20:45.287
What are you?

20:46.462 --> 20:47.333
On the take?

20:48.159 --> 20:50.771
Ben Timmons is the one
honest cop in this town, Ryder.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.557
Ryder's okay, Ben.

20:58.257 --> 20:59.127
Okay, then.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.358
You got a place to stay?

21:12.967 --> 21:15.883
Seems as though last night
I stayed at the Paradise Hotel.

21:17.145 --> 21:18.625
We can do better than that.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.280
Show him the room.

21:31.028 --> 21:31.942
Follow me.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.136
I was a bartender here
till I finished law school,

21:52.223 --> 21:54.617
so I used this room
when I worked nights.

21:57.011 --> 21:57.925
Sheets are clean.

21:58.839 --> 21:59.709
How much?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.364
Fifty bucks a night.

22:02.582 --> 22:04.497
And maybe
if it gets busy at the bar,

22:04.584 --> 22:05.802
you could help out a bit?

22:07.804 --> 22:08.675
Okay.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.242
So, those guys,

22:12.069 --> 22:13.593
Jack, Bud, and Tink...

22:14.768 --> 22:17.379
what's their deal?
Was she paying them off?

22:18.206 --> 22:20.469
Those clowns work
for a guy named Paul Sanborn.

22:21.514 --> 22:22.515
You know that name?

22:22.732 --> 22:23.646
Should I?

22:37.704 --> 22:39.445
Citizens, we have a game.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.404
"Paul Sanborn has a vision."

22:44.798 --> 22:46.016
Does he really have a vision?

22:46.495 --> 22:48.715
Yeah, making shit tons of money.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.282
So, what were those guys
doing collecting that envelope?

22:52.936 --> 22:55.286
Every year,
there's this charity thing

22:55.374 --> 22:58.594
Sanborn runs, and his minions
collect "donations."

22:58.725 --> 22:59.726
Donations?

22:59.856 --> 23:00.901
If you don't contribute,

23:01.292 --> 23:03.730
the health inspector starts
to show up on a daily basis,

23:03.817 --> 23:05.471
and your garbage
doesn't get picked up.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.777
It's easier this way.

23:08.778 --> 23:11.259
Plus, I write it off
on Shelly's taxes.

23:13.914 --> 23:15.394
Okay, sounds kind of shady.

23:16.569 --> 23:19.223
Truly, it's small potatoes
to Sanborn.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.835
But it's his charity,

23:21.922 --> 23:24.925
and I think he likes
to control people.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.450
He asks and everyone gives.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.410
I have to get back to work.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.261
Who are you?

24:18.152 --> 24:19.806
You don't have to do this!

24:20.720 --> 24:22.678
Who is this boy to question you?

24:24.158 --> 24:27.378
Maintain the law.
An example has to be made.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.688
Do you hold
with your decision, stranger?

24:33.646 --> 24:35.386
I've made my choice!

24:35.909 --> 24:37.432
Then may the gods be with you.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.012
Who the fuck are you?

25:55.641 --> 25:56.511
Paul.

25:57.773 --> 25:58.600
Roger.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.260
You're gonna make me start,
aren't you?

26:07.217 --> 26:08.392
You know why I'm here.

26:09.263 --> 26:10.743
I do. I do.

26:11.657 --> 26:12.527
And?

26:13.006 --> 26:15.922
And you're not going to like
what I have to say.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.490
Oh.

26:21.492 --> 26:22.406
Try me.

26:23.407 --> 26:25.758
I can't let you do this
to the people of this city.

26:29.152 --> 26:31.285
"The people of this city."
Can you believe it?

26:31.851 --> 26:34.723
Cocksucker's born
with a silver spoon up his ass

26:34.810 --> 26:36.812
and he thinks he understands
the people of this city!

26:36.899 --> 26:38.901
This is from a man
who won't eat in any restaurant

26:38.988 --> 26:40.337
that doesn't have
a Michelin star!

26:40.729 --> 26:42.513
Roger Hammond wouldn't know
the people of this city

26:42.601 --> 26:43.950
if they kicked him in the balls.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.266
So,
how do you want to play it?

26:56.440 --> 26:57.441
I don't know, Jack,

26:57.616 --> 26:58.834
but we'll have
to think of something

26:58.921 --> 26:59.922
really good, won't we?

27:05.101 --> 27:08.365
You know, I took good time
out of my day to see this SOB.

27:09.149 --> 27:10.150
What a waste.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.681
Bring forth the accused.

28:14.736 --> 28:17.434
Live! Live! Live! Live...

28:42.111 --> 28:43.330
How do I know you?

28:47.160 --> 28:48.683
Mr. Hammond
wasn't very receptive,

28:48.770 --> 28:50.206
- I take it.
- No.

28:50.990 --> 28:53.209
There's always confusion
around a good idea.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.734
You surely
won't let this deter you.

28:56.604 --> 28:57.910
No, I will not.

28:59.302 --> 29:01.740
Perhaps there's something
that this Hammond man wants,

29:01.827 --> 29:03.480
something that only you
could give him.

29:03.829 --> 29:07.571
That son a bitch can pretty much
have anything he wants.

29:07.702 --> 29:09.878
Jack, bring what we have
on Hammond.

29:11.662 --> 29:15.579
Roger Hammond is rich.
He's filthy rich.

29:17.059 --> 29:17.973
Born into money.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.628
He's faithful to his wife.
He pays his taxes.

29:21.150 --> 29:22.543
He volunteers at a soup kitchen.

29:22.673 --> 29:23.979
Nobody is that clean.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.764
There must be some dirt on him.

29:26.852 --> 29:27.896
His daughter does ballet.

29:28.157 --> 29:30.290
Last month, he took
a 24hour flight from Seoul

29:30.986 --> 29:33.032
and went directly
from the airport to her recital.

29:33.597 --> 29:34.685
He owns his own plane.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.209
I'm sure
he was quite comfortable.

29:36.905 --> 29:39.081
But that leads us
to the question, gentlemen.

29:40.213 --> 29:43.433
With what do you bribe a man
who already has everything?

29:43.825 --> 29:45.348
If there's nothing
you can give him,

29:45.609 --> 29:48.003
how about something
you can threaten to take away?

29:50.353 --> 29:53.226
Every man needs to worry
about the safety of his family.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.469
The people want more.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.950
Give them what they want!

30:23.778 --> 30:24.910
I will fight him.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.783
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight...

31:38.984 --> 31:41.856
You certainly
get around, Mr. Ryder.

32:18.980 --> 32:19.850
Hey.

32:20.808 --> 32:21.722
Hey, yourself.

32:24.246 --> 32:25.639
You know,
I was just wondering...

32:30.992 --> 32:32.428
are you cool with me being here?

32:33.038 --> 32:33.908
Dude,

32:34.561 --> 32:37.956
do you think my grandmother asks
my permission for anything?

32:40.436 --> 32:41.568
So, you said you're a lawyer?

32:42.482 --> 32:44.353
I'm a legal aid attorney.

32:46.094 --> 32:49.054
This place is sort of
my unofficial office.

32:50.185 --> 32:51.317
I kind of grew up here.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.536
You guys are tight, aren't you?

32:53.972 --> 32:56.409
My folks were killed
by a drunk driver when I was 18.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.280
Shelly made sure
I got through college

32:58.367 --> 33:00.500
on what they left me,
then she paid for law school.

33:02.719 --> 33:04.852
Kept me from losing my mind
during all of it.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.551
And she left me alone
to make all my own decisions.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.771
Never tried to tell me
what to do.

33:13.426 --> 33:14.993
"Morgan V. Stram."

33:15.819 --> 33:17.082
What's the V stand for?

33:18.692 --> 33:20.911
Um, Virgil.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.870
Virgil?

33:24.393 --> 33:26.134
It's Shelly's last name,

33:26.221 --> 33:29.224
and it's like this
family tradition or something.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.792
Don't blame me!
That was your mom's idea.

33:31.879 --> 33:34.012
- Let me get that.
-I got it. I got it.

33:34.273 --> 33:36.405
Hey, now that's cool.

33:37.189 --> 33:38.668
Like Virgil the Roman poet.

33:38.886 --> 33:41.149
The Roman poet?
Never heard of him.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.238
He, uh, he wrote <i>The Aeneid.</i>

33:43.847 --> 33:45.284
And in Dante's <i>Inferno,</i>

33:45.371 --> 33:47.155
he serves
as the guide into hell.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.418
I know who he is.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.204
The guide into hell,
though, that sounds cool.

33:53.553 --> 33:55.642
Oh. That's Roger Hammond.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.252
He needs to talk.

33:58.819 --> 34:00.168
- See you later, sweetie.
-See you.

34:05.826 --> 34:06.870
See you around.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.321
- Who's Roger Hammond?
- He's a councilman.

34:22.756 --> 34:25.585
He's opposing
Paul Sanborn's big development,

34:25.672 --> 34:27.804
and Morgan
is one of the attorneys

34:27.891 --> 34:30.372
leading a coalition
of townspeople.

34:32.592 --> 34:35.116
-Here we go.
- Lunchtime rush?

34:35.682 --> 34:37.031
Leo's gonna be thrilled.

34:38.511 --> 34:39.512
Hey!

34:39.729 --> 34:41.557
How you doing today?
What can I get you?

34:42.776 --> 34:44.821
Yeah, all right.
That everything?

34:57.399 --> 34:58.574
Terrible story, huh?

35:01.925 --> 35:02.796
What's up?

35:04.406 --> 35:05.320
Nothing.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.236
Didn't you ask me
about a little girl?

35:09.759 --> 35:11.761
Yeah. Yeah.

35:13.502 --> 35:14.373
Terrible.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.336
Hold your horses,
Leo, I'm coming!

35:41.051 --> 35:42.749
At the risk of repeating myself,

35:43.489 --> 35:46.274
it's pointless to leave
any of the old city intact.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.755
If you're going to do something,

35:48.842 --> 35:50.148
why aren't you going
to do it properly?

35:51.018 --> 35:53.063
Do you know how many people live
in this part of the city?

35:53.151 --> 35:55.065
Of course, you do. I used to...

35:55.414 --> 35:57.459
I used to walk these streets
to get to my school.

35:58.678 --> 36:01.855
So, how can I kick these people
out of their homes?

36:02.986 --> 36:05.206
Maybe we can keep the housing,

36:06.120 --> 36:07.817
and the culture,
and the community,

36:08.253 --> 36:10.646
and, uh, put some money
into infrastructure.

36:10.907 --> 36:13.475
They'll have all of that,
and they'll have new housing.

36:13.693 --> 36:16.174
It's simply a matter
of efficiency, that's all.

36:16.304 --> 36:17.958
They'll be outpriced,
and you know it.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.265
- This is their home.
- Whatever it is you decide,

36:20.917 --> 36:22.789
you'll still have
your nasty little friend,

36:22.876 --> 36:25.052
Councilman Hammond,
standing in your way.

36:25.487 --> 36:27.272
Sometimes you have to push
a person

36:27.359 --> 36:29.230
- to make the right decision.
-Yeah.

36:29.839 --> 36:32.581
Your young associate has a plan
that he wants to share with you.

36:32.799 --> 36:34.279
- Oh.
- Isn't that so, Jack?

36:34.714 --> 36:35.802
If you don't mind.

36:38.718 --> 36:39.588
Of course.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.895
Of course, Jack.
We'd love to hear it.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.202
I've given it some thought.

36:44.724 --> 36:47.292
What can we hold against Hammond
that he really cares about?

36:48.684 --> 36:49.555
His daughter.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.733
I have a plan
to retain her and hold her

36:53.820 --> 36:55.648
until he signs what we need.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.519
It's difficult but doable.

36:59.608 --> 37:01.262
We're kidnapping a child?

37:01.349 --> 37:03.264
But you'll see to it
that no one gets hurt,

37:03.351 --> 37:05.745
won't you, Jack?
Especially the child.

37:06.659 --> 37:07.877
You know
what you're doing, Jack?

37:08.791 --> 37:11.229
He's right.
No one will get hurt.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.667
And Hammond will do
whatever we ask of him.

37:15.494 --> 37:17.974
Sometimes you have to have
the stomach to persuade people

37:18.584 --> 37:20.107
not to make the wrong choice.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.674
Of course.

37:24.285 --> 37:26.679
Wonderful.
That's wonderful, Paul.

37:43.783 --> 37:44.958
We're closed!

37:45.654 --> 37:46.742
Even for me?

37:48.178 --> 37:51.051
Never for you, Ben.
What are you having?

37:51.530 --> 37:54.054
Beer. Whatever you got
that's cold, Shelly.

37:56.317 --> 37:57.927
Evening, Mr. Ryder.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.234
Evening, Detective.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.589
I'm gonna go
take the garbage out.

38:19.732 --> 38:20.907
Where are you going?

38:21.124 --> 38:22.387
You didn't even touch your beer.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.520
I guess I'm not
so thirsty after all.

38:26.042 --> 38:27.130
See you later, Shelly.

39:10.957 --> 39:11.827
So...

39:12.872 --> 39:14.090
tell me, Ryder...

39:14.961 --> 39:15.831
Who is this?

39:16.571 --> 39:19.661
No, not yet.
Soon, but not yet.

39:21.533 --> 39:22.751
How did you get this number?

39:25.450 --> 39:27.365
<i>You've been having bad dreams.</i>

39:29.584 --> 39:33.719
<i>You could try pharmaceuticals,
religion, therapy, but...</i>

39:34.328 --> 39:36.156
I can tell you now,
they won't work.

39:41.988 --> 39:42.902
Who are you?

39:45.165 --> 39:47.080
We have a game to play, Ryder.

39:48.734 --> 39:49.735
What game?

39:52.346 --> 39:53.695
<i>I'll be in touch.</i>

41:22.218 --> 41:24.786
They haven't paid
the taxes on the property.

41:26.527 --> 41:27.876
And you don't wish to sell?

41:28.268 --> 41:30.400
My lord, the property has been

41:30.488 --> 41:32.185
in my family
for two generations.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.580
Please give me the time
to pay the taxes.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.321
My offer was fair.

41:38.408 --> 41:39.453
Please, my lord.

41:41.803 --> 41:44.719
My lord,
this is no place for a lady.

41:45.285 --> 41:48.027
My dear,
what are you doing here?

41:48.723 --> 41:50.595
This is wrong,
what you're doing.

41:51.596 --> 41:52.466
Really?

41:52.814 --> 41:55.513
With respect, my lord,
a precedent must be set.

41:56.165 --> 41:59.212
Otherwise, they'll all be trying
to take advantage of you.

41:59.342 --> 42:02.520
You mustn't do this!
I fear for your soul.

42:03.042 --> 42:05.392
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

42:18.448 --> 42:20.102
-Good morning.
- Hey.

42:21.930 --> 42:23.497
Why don't you
pour us both coffee?

42:27.414 --> 42:28.937
You know,
when I was a little girl,

42:30.069 --> 42:31.505
I looked out our kitchen window

42:31.592 --> 42:34.116
and I saw
a man standing outside.

42:35.509 --> 42:38.468
My mom was next to me,
only she couldn't see him,

42:38.599 --> 42:39.513
but I could.

42:40.253 --> 42:43.169
He had a kind of outline,
an aura.

42:43.386 --> 42:45.214
And I just knew he was a ghost.

42:47.216 --> 42:49.001
All my life, I've seen things,

42:49.349 --> 42:51.612
things that other people
don't see.

42:53.309 --> 42:54.615
So, I'm a ghost?

42:55.660 --> 42:56.661
Not quite.

42:57.531 --> 43:00.447
Your aura is different.

43:01.840 --> 43:03.755
What am I?I have no idea.

43:04.364 --> 43:07.106
But I can tell you one thing,
you ain't from around here.

43:24.384 --> 43:25.298
Yeah?

43:26.299 --> 43:28.040
You run those fingerprints
on the bottle for me?

43:29.737 --> 43:30.608
That was quick.

43:31.652 --> 43:32.653
Two sets?

43:33.915 --> 43:36.091
Yeah, she's the bar owner.
What about the other set?

43:37.832 --> 43:39.617
And you ran them
through all the databases,

43:39.704 --> 43:40.661
state and federal?

43:42.445 --> 43:43.446
Do me a favor.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.929
Yeah. Get back to me
once you do. Thanks.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.240
What?

43:56.546 --> 43:57.504
Mr. Ryder.

43:58.853 --> 43:59.811
What can I do for you?

44:03.118 --> 44:04.076
What of it?

44:05.425 --> 44:07.209
You've come to confess
to kidnapping now?

44:09.255 --> 44:11.779
Relax, Mr. Ryder. She was found.

44:12.171 --> 44:14.042
Turns out she was sleeping over
at a friend's house

44:14.129 --> 44:15.348
and forgot to call her mom.

44:16.436 --> 44:17.437
What's it to you?

44:20.614 --> 44:22.050
Tell me about Paul Sanborn.

44:25.358 --> 44:27.055
A cop can get
into a lot of trouble

44:27.142 --> 44:29.014
talking about Paul Sanborn
in this city.

44:29.579 --> 44:31.277
Why you got
his picture on your wall?

44:31.886 --> 44:33.888
I've been a cop
for almost 20 years.

44:34.236 --> 44:37.152
Paul Sanborn has owned this city
that entire time.

44:37.544 --> 44:39.067
- And?
- And...

44:40.939 --> 44:41.940
And that's all.

44:44.029 --> 44:46.771
He's rich,
and he's powerful,

44:47.162 --> 44:48.555
and he doesn't
always have the city's

44:48.642 --> 44:49.861
best interests in mind.

44:50.165 --> 44:52.690
But a cop can get in trouble
for talking about him.

44:52.951 --> 44:53.908
Exactly.

44:55.431 --> 44:57.042
Have a nice day, Mr. Ryder.

44:59.740 --> 45:00.698
It's just Ryder.

45:40.955 --> 45:41.826
Here you go.

45:44.611 --> 45:46.482
Allow me to introduce myself.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.098
Mr. Soach.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.406
Interesting name.

45:57.755 --> 46:00.845
Once upon a time, I believe
it was pronounced Soach.

46:04.631 --> 46:07.068
Could you get me
your oldest Scotch?

46:07.155 --> 46:09.201
Or at least the most expensive.

46:09.288 --> 46:10.942
I'm sure it will be dreadful.

46:11.856 --> 46:12.770
I'll manage.

46:30.309 --> 46:31.310
Keep the change.

46:33.442 --> 46:35.009
I'm sure Shelly
will appreciate it.

46:39.013 --> 46:39.884
Delicious.

46:43.496 --> 46:45.411
- I'm an architect.
- I know.

46:46.499 --> 46:49.371
You're designing Paul Sanborn's
city of the future.

46:50.198 --> 46:52.766
I read a great magazine piece,
and you were mentioned,

46:53.158 --> 46:54.289
in passing, but...

46:56.117 --> 46:57.249
there weren't
any pictures of you.

46:57.336 --> 46:59.425
I like to think of myself
as underground.

47:00.469 --> 47:01.731
Underground famous.

47:03.429 --> 47:06.040
People like Paul Sanborn
have their picture

47:06.171 --> 47:09.000
in the papers and magazines.
They talk on TV.

47:11.263 --> 47:12.960
I prefer to stay
in the background.

47:29.368 --> 47:30.717
You're the one
who called me last night?

47:30.848 --> 47:31.718
Yes, I did.

47:32.153 --> 47:33.851
-How'd you find me?
- A little bird told me.

47:35.417 --> 47:37.942
Paul Sanborn's name
opens doors in this city.

47:41.336 --> 47:42.381
Who are you?

47:42.990 --> 47:44.470
Have you not been listening?

47:46.428 --> 47:47.908
Aside from being an architect...

47:49.867 --> 47:52.695
I suppose I'm a...
I'm a sort of...

47:54.872 --> 47:56.569
motivational speaker.

47:59.528 --> 48:01.095
A precedent must be set.

48:01.748 --> 48:04.316
Otherwise, they'll all try
to take advantage of you.

48:04.533 --> 48:07.275
I find that a good threat
motivates people.

48:07.406 --> 48:10.713
Maintain the law.
An example has to be made.

48:12.193 --> 48:13.281
It's not possible.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.806
I think
there are infinite possibilities

48:16.894 --> 48:18.460
beyond what we know.

48:22.247 --> 48:23.683
If only you could see.

48:31.778 --> 48:33.345
- Good evening.
- Thanks.

48:35.521 --> 48:36.435
Where's Shelly?

48:37.958 --> 48:39.394
Storage room.

48:41.962 --> 48:43.137
Who was that guy?

48:44.791 --> 48:47.315
He's the architect working
with Paul Sanborn

48:47.402 --> 48:48.316
on his big development.

48:50.753 --> 48:52.407
You don't like Sanborn, do you?

48:53.191 --> 48:54.192
What's not to like?

48:56.020 --> 48:56.977
He owns this city.

48:57.064 --> 48:58.283
I keep hearing that.

48:59.588 --> 49:00.938
Tell me about Roger Hammond.

49:01.764 --> 49:02.852
Roger Hammond?

49:03.331 --> 49:05.507
He's opposing Sanborn's bid
to make the city over,

49:05.594 --> 49:06.987
and I'm helping out.

49:07.770 --> 49:09.250
Son of a bitch!

49:10.077 --> 49:10.948
I got it.

49:32.360 --> 49:33.187
Wait a minute!

49:33.927 --> 49:35.102
Since you won't have a home,

49:36.016 --> 49:38.758
you're gonna need
a place to stay, a warm bed.

49:39.411 --> 49:41.239
Unhand the lady.

49:44.372 --> 49:46.418
Do you take orders from him?

49:46.722 --> 49:48.159
This is none of your concern.

50:05.567 --> 50:06.525
Just leave.

51:08.761 --> 51:09.631
Hey!

51:11.590 --> 51:12.547
Hey.

51:22.818 --> 51:23.906
Are you okay, hon?

51:24.385 --> 51:25.386
It's closing time.

51:25.952 --> 51:26.953
We're closed.

51:31.218 --> 51:32.219
Where were you?

51:35.396 --> 51:36.267
I'm not sure.

51:50.063 --> 51:51.978
- Where are you going?
- Come on.

51:53.806 --> 51:55.112
Okay, where are we going?

52:04.643 --> 52:05.513
Here.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.692
You want me to go to church?

52:10.997 --> 52:13.130
There's someone inside
you should talk to.

52:13.608 --> 52:14.827
Mrs. Mokosh.

52:17.482 --> 52:18.396
Go on.

52:19.353 --> 52:20.224
Just you.

52:50.471 --> 52:51.472
Mrs. Mokosh?

52:55.084 --> 52:57.391
I like to sit. My knees.

52:58.479 --> 53:00.786
So, what are you looking for?

53:01.874 --> 53:03.397
Oh, I think I'm looking for you.

53:03.484 --> 53:06.966
Nobody who comes here
is looking for me.

53:08.446 --> 53:11.623
Have you ever heard
of Chernobog and Belobog?

53:11.884 --> 53:12.972
You know these names?

53:14.234 --> 53:15.322
Well, they seem...

53:17.324 --> 53:18.325
familiar.

53:18.978 --> 53:22.938
Chernobog and Belobog
are Slavic deities.

53:23.635 --> 53:25.854
The Black god and the White one.

53:26.855 --> 53:30.859
The people who built this church
wouldn't have admitted it,

53:31.251 --> 53:33.819
but in private,
they still say their prayers

53:33.906 --> 53:34.950
to both of them.

53:36.125 --> 53:38.519
Many cultures
have these figures,

53:38.606 --> 53:43.045
opposing forces doomed forever
to confront one another.

53:44.133 --> 53:45.178
Good and evil?

53:45.744 --> 53:46.875
Some call it that.

53:47.485 --> 53:51.576
Others see it as a dance
between order and chaos.

53:52.054 --> 53:55.623
Whatever it is,
you are here for a reason.

53:56.102 --> 53:57.016
And that is?

53:57.190 --> 53:59.801
That's for you to figure out.

53:59.975 --> 54:01.499
Fine.

54:02.064 --> 54:03.588
I'll tell you this much.

54:04.023 --> 54:07.548
Sometimes,
you can't fight the current.

54:08.462 --> 54:11.117
Sometimes,
you have to go with it.

54:16.296 --> 54:17.602
So what you're saying is--

54:46.674 --> 54:48.154
How do you know her?

54:48.328 --> 54:52.071
Dude, I see dead people.
And so do you, apparently.

55:08.043 --> 55:10.263
What the hell was that?

55:12.004 --> 55:14.006
Never mind. I don't wanna know.

55:15.050 --> 55:16.748
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

55:17.270 --> 55:18.445
There's a diner
around the corner.

55:18.706 --> 55:19.620
I'm not hungry.

55:19.838 --> 55:21.535
I am, and you're buying!

55:24.886 --> 55:26.801
I think
my granddaughter likes you.

55:43.514 --> 55:44.384
Yeah?

55:44.515 --> 55:45.429
It's Jack.

55:46.386 --> 55:48.345
<i>We met
the other night at Shelly's.</i>

55:48.736 --> 55:50.042
Yeah, I know who you are.

55:51.522 --> 55:53.001
I was wondering
if you might be interested

55:53.088 --> 55:54.307
in some work.

55:55.395 --> 55:56.875
Why would you offer me work?

56:02.315 --> 56:04.578
Well...
...I have my reasons.

56:05.405 --> 56:06.754
<i>I'll make it worth your while.</i>

56:07.886 --> 56:09.061
I'll think about it.

56:16.111 --> 56:18.549
- You sure about this?
- I'm absolutely sure.

56:18.897 --> 56:19.898
Sure about what?

56:21.073 --> 56:24.206
Mr. Soach has recommended
someone for the upcoming job.

56:24.816 --> 56:26.034
Oh, really?

56:26.426 --> 56:28.472
You know how it is, Paul.
You meet people over the years.

56:29.255 --> 56:30.909
Gentlemen,
we should be very careful

56:30.996 --> 56:33.172
about inviting
new people in on this one.

56:34.042 --> 56:35.827
I leave these decisions to you.

56:36.654 --> 56:39.004
It's outside
my field of expertise.

56:40.919 --> 56:42.181
You met this guy?

56:42.311 --> 56:43.443
I did.

56:43.661 --> 56:46.228
I think you'll like him.
There's something about him.

56:47.752 --> 56:49.797
All right. You can hire him...

56:50.668 --> 56:52.409
if we go forward on this thing.

56:52.887 --> 56:53.845
What do you mean?

56:54.236 --> 56:57.326
I mean, I'm having reservations,
that's what I mean.

56:58.023 --> 56:59.416
About what, exactly?

57:02.419 --> 57:03.289
Everything.

57:05.683 --> 57:07.336
We've been over it all before.

57:09.164 --> 57:11.123
You're doing this
for the benefit of the people,

57:11.340 --> 57:14.256
and you can't let one man stand
in the way of that.

57:15.910 --> 57:19.914
A certain action has to be taken
to ensure the greater good.

57:20.001 --> 57:22.090
Stop trying
to manipulate me, Soach.

57:22.177 --> 57:23.222
Stop it!

57:24.005 --> 57:26.791
I make my own decisions.
I make my own choices.

57:27.226 --> 57:30.098
Anything I do,
I do, because I see fit.

57:30.229 --> 57:33.798
Yes.
I'm not suggesting otherwise.

57:39.804 --> 57:40.805
Here we are.

57:41.893 --> 57:43.982
Roger Hammond
talking to the press.

57:44.112 --> 57:45.679
<i>What are you gonna do</i>

57:45.766 --> 57:47.028
<i>about Paul Sanborn's
development?</i>

57:47.159 --> 57:48.552
<i>Paul Sanborn</i>

57:48.639 --> 57:50.771
<i>will be treated like
any other resident in this city.</i>

57:51.119 --> 57:54.775
<i>The days of ward politics
and backroom deals are over.</i>

57:55.384 --> 57:58.213
<i>Paul Sanborn
owns a great deal of things...</i>

57:58.997 --> 58:02.566
<i>but he does not own me,
and he does not own this city.</i>

58:02.740 --> 58:04.350
<i>We will not be
intimidated by him,</i>

58:04.437 --> 58:06.265
<i>or anyone else
intending to bully us.</i>

58:07.396 --> 58:08.310
<i>Thank you.</i>

58:15.187 --> 58:16.231
All right!

58:17.885 --> 58:19.321
Do what has to be done!

59:23.734 --> 59:24.996
I see that you're in.

59:27.564 --> 59:31.655
Five K up front.
The rest, when the job is over.

01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:04.035
I've put a little extra for you,
all right?

01:00:04.122 --> 01:00:05.384
For what you did last time.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:16.700
Industrial park.
Used to be factories.

01:00:17.222 --> 01:00:18.789
Now, it's a warehouse district.

01:00:19.572 --> 01:00:24.185
Mr. Sanborn owns everything,
five blocks in all directions,

01:00:24.272 --> 01:00:25.926
so the streets will be empty.

01:00:26.666 --> 01:00:29.538
This is the perfect place
for the ambush we are setting.

01:00:30.714 --> 01:00:32.585
We will block off
one side of the street.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:33.934
<i>We'll then cut them off,</i>

01:00:34.021 --> 01:00:35.849
<i>forcing them
onto the side streets.</i>

01:00:37.372 --> 01:00:40.549
<i>Once they are off the main road,</i>

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.987
<i>we will continue
to cut off the access streets,</i>

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:44.162
<i>driving them...</i>

01:00:45.424 --> 01:00:46.294
here...

01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:47.731
where we will be waiting.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.172
The target's name
is Annie Hammond.

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.183
Annie is ten.

01:01:05.749 --> 01:01:08.316
Does anyone have a problem
kidnapping a ten-year-old child?

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.368
Annie has a bodyguard
and a driver.

01:01:16.585 --> 01:01:18.413
<i>They are professionals.
They will be armed.</i>

01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:21.634
Hopefully, they'll see
they're outgunned

01:01:21.721 --> 01:01:22.679
and pinned down.

01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:25.246
What if they don't see it?

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.814
Then we will neutralize
them quickly and efficiently.

01:01:29.729 --> 01:01:32.210
We will reconvene here
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:34.168
Annie has ballet
in the early evening.

01:01:34.995 --> 01:01:36.954
We will pick her up
on the way home.

01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:42.394
Gentlemen.

01:02:47.938 --> 01:02:48.982
Move!

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:50.418
On your knees!

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.638
There's no need for this.

01:02:52.725 --> 01:02:55.684
There's been a verified sighting
of the resistance.

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:57.730
They lie.

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.428
They need to be executed.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:09.481
General?

01:03:13.964 --> 01:03:16.270
General,
they await your command.

01:03:23.321 --> 01:03:24.888
Get the men in the transports.

01:03:25.497 --> 01:03:27.542
- This is over.
- I implore you, General,

01:03:27.629 --> 01:03:28.543
if you retreat,

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:30.502
they will say
you lost your nerve!

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:33.984
This is over!

01:03:35.724 --> 01:03:38.684
The Fuührer will receive word
that you're weak.

01:03:39.467 --> 01:03:41.556
Are you... weak?

01:03:45.952 --> 01:03:47.911
Is this what you want?
Is this what you want?

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:50.435
Good. All right, fine!
Here it is!

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:08.496
What have I done?

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:15.460
What have I done?
What have you made me do?

01:04:15.547 --> 01:04:17.027
I didn't make you
do anything, General.

01:04:17.114 --> 01:04:19.159
I simply pointed out
what you had to do.

01:04:19.725 --> 01:04:22.597
And you,
honorably, did the rest.

01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:48.928
Good afternoon, Ryder.

01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:51.888
What's going on?

01:04:53.019 --> 01:04:56.588
Do you sometimes feel
that life is just...

01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:58.242
inevitable?

01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:01.985
No matter
how many times you show up...

01:05:02.942 --> 01:05:05.205
no matter how many times
you try to do something,

01:05:05.292 --> 01:05:07.904
it just turns out, well...

01:05:10.341 --> 01:05:11.385
wrong.

01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:16.782
Perhaps bad... needs to win...

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.438
so that good
has a reason to continue.

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:21.961
I don't believe that.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:23.006
No?

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:30.491
History proves you wrong.

01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:34.669
Mankind manages
to skew towards the bad,

01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:38.499
and history repeats itself
over and over again.

01:05:43.809 --> 01:05:45.942
And still manage
to get it wrong...

01:05:47.813 --> 01:05:52.383
uh, time and time again...
no matter what you do.

01:05:58.084 --> 01:05:59.303
You feel helpless...

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:02.132
just swimming
against the current...

01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:05.918
under your nose.

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:11.880
Sometimes,
you can't fight the current.

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:14.361
Sometimes,
you have to go with it.

01:06:15.928 --> 01:06:17.669
Sometimes,
you have to go with the current.

01:06:17.799 --> 01:06:18.800
Yes.

01:06:19.236 --> 01:06:23.196
You need to look...
into the darkness of yourself,

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:26.721
into the person
you don't want to be...

01:06:27.722 --> 01:06:29.855
to know who you really are.

01:06:33.032 --> 01:06:35.600
Things will change.

01:06:35.687 --> 01:06:36.993
Will you join me?

01:06:37.863 --> 01:06:40.039
You might even like
what happens next.

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:44.217
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:44.913 --> 01:06:46.872
All this trying
to save the world.

01:06:47.742 --> 01:06:50.093
Come on, man. What about you?

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.010
You've never
really known pleasure.

01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:58.188
The joy
of what it is to be alive.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:04.368
You've never known love.

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.029
Come on, man!

01:07:58.683 --> 01:07:59.814
You covering for Shelly?

01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:02.948
- It's her poker night.
- Why didn't she ask me?

01:08:03.818 --> 01:08:06.734
'Cause I'm a legal aid attorney,
and I can use the tips.

01:08:08.301 --> 01:08:09.607
Shelly plays poker?

01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:11.348
Well, I bet she's good.

01:08:11.565 --> 01:08:12.566
She is.

01:08:13.350 --> 01:08:15.961
Says she can see the auras
of the other players.

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:18.224
She knows when they're bluffing.

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:21.401
But you don't believe her.

01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:22.924
She's a bartender who knows...

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:24.622
... a bullshit artist
when she sees one.

01:08:33.021 --> 01:08:34.066
Good night.

01:08:40.072 --> 01:08:42.161
- Does he ever pay?
-When he can.

01:08:43.031 --> 01:08:44.598
Shelly lets him slide
when he can't.

01:08:44.946 --> 01:08:47.558
She puts up a tough front,

01:08:47.645 --> 01:08:49.951
but she's a softy
when it counts.

01:08:50.909 --> 01:08:52.345
Don't tell her I said that.

01:08:52.476 --> 01:08:56.044
My lips... are sealed.

01:09:02.877 --> 01:09:04.009
I guess...

01:09:06.316 --> 01:09:07.752
I will go upstairs.

01:09:34.213 --> 01:09:35.171
Shelly's.

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:36.650
<i>Hey, Morgan. How are you doing?</i>

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:38.348
<i>It's Detective Timmons.</i>

01:09:38.957 --> 01:09:41.438
<i>Is he there? Put him on, please.</i>

01:09:43.527 --> 01:09:44.484
It's for you.

01:09:51.665 --> 01:09:54.451
We need to talk. I'm out front.

01:10:35.056 --> 01:10:36.841
I had your fingerprints checked.

01:10:38.059 --> 01:10:40.932
I had to run them through
every possible database...

01:10:41.715 --> 01:10:42.760
and nothing.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.110
Can't find a thing on you.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:46.894
You're a ghost.

01:10:48.374 --> 01:10:51.072
I don't like ghosts.

01:10:51.377 --> 01:10:53.118
Hell, I don't believe in ghosts.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:55.251
Who are you, Mr. Ryder?

01:10:55.599 --> 01:10:57.253
What are you doing in my town?

01:11:03.694 --> 01:11:04.738
Listen...

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:09.526
I... dislike Sanborn
as much as the next guy,

01:11:10.048 --> 01:11:12.093
but I can't just stand by
and let you do

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:13.878
what I think
you're plannin' to do.

01:11:16.707 --> 01:11:18.143
Stay out of my way.

01:11:58.183 --> 01:11:59.140
How'd you get that?

01:12:03.797 --> 01:12:04.668
I don't know.

01:12:06.887 --> 01:12:08.106
There must be a story.

01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:11.762
I'm sure there is.

01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:13.894
So, tell it.

01:12:18.899 --> 01:12:20.248
But some other time.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.794
What are you looking at?

01:15:00.626 --> 01:15:01.584
You.

01:15:04.978 --> 01:15:07.198
You don't like talking
about yourself, do you?

01:15:10.549 --> 01:15:12.595
- Not much to tell.
-Please.

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:14.466
Everybody's got a story to tell.

01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:15.859
What, even Leo?

01:15:17.251 --> 01:15:18.905
Even Leo!

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:20.820
But we're not talking about him.

01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:24.432
- We're talking about you.
-What about me?

01:15:28.436 --> 01:15:29.612
I don't know.

01:15:31.265 --> 01:15:32.789
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

01:16:38.855 --> 01:16:41.118
Something came up.
Morgan had to go.

01:16:41.553 --> 01:16:42.423
You saw Morgan?

01:16:42.554 --> 01:16:43.424
Yeah.

01:16:44.077 --> 01:16:45.339
She was glowing.

01:16:47.733 --> 01:16:49.387
What, you think
I don't notice stuff?

01:16:50.431 --> 01:16:52.129
Poker night last night, huh?

01:16:52.216 --> 01:16:53.173
Yeah!

01:16:53.783 --> 01:16:55.393
- Did you win?
- I broke even.

01:16:56.089 --> 01:16:58.962
I can't win all the time,
they'd notice.

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:02.661
Morgan doesn't believe

01:17:03.009 --> 01:17:04.968
that you can see the auras
of the other players.

01:17:05.403 --> 01:17:07.013
She's too practical
for all that.

01:17:07.753 --> 01:17:09.712
I stopped telling her
about it years ago.

01:17:09.799 --> 01:17:11.496
She's more like her mom
that way.

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:13.106
You're not practical?

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:14.238
It's different.

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:17.458
Morgan sees the world that is...

01:17:18.285 --> 01:17:21.245
and she tries to save
her little part of it.

01:17:21.506 --> 01:17:23.116
I gave that up a long time ago.

01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:27.773
Somehow, I get the feeling
that's what you're up to.

01:17:29.383 --> 01:17:31.908
Saving the world,
one, little piece at a time.

01:17:37.174 --> 01:17:38.523
"Mister Soach."

01:17:39.045 --> 01:17:40.264
Interesting name.

01:17:41.004 --> 01:17:42.614
There's an anagram
you can make out of it.

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:46.749
Turn it over.

01:18:12.992 --> 01:18:15.299
-Roger, did you see this?
-Morgan.

01:18:15.865 --> 01:18:17.780
Sanborn's attorneys
submitted it yesterday

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:19.172
at the close of business.

01:18:19.259 --> 01:18:20.478
Tried to sneak it past us.

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:22.567
Sanborn promised
to leave the old city intact,

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.221
but now he intends
to tear everything down.

01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:27.137
Well, he can try, Morgan,
but without my vote,

01:18:27.267 --> 01:18:28.791
he can't get away
with any of this.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.097
I hope so.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:33.360
There is nothing he can do

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:34.927
that will make me
change my mind.

01:18:40.237 --> 01:18:42.021
- Hi, Daddy!
-Sweetheart!

01:18:44.023 --> 01:18:45.721
- Hi, Morgan!
- Hey, sweetie.

01:19:19.972 --> 01:19:21.365
Where did this come from?

01:19:38.643 --> 01:19:39.949
Must you do this?

01:19:40.906 --> 01:19:42.429
I thought better of you.

01:19:44.692 --> 01:19:45.998
I will not watch.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:55.878
There is no one
hiding in this town.

01:19:56.922 --> 01:19:59.359
These are just
good, simple people.

01:20:03.363 --> 01:20:05.061
<i>You mustn't do this.</i>

01:20:05.409 --> 01:20:07.019
<i>I fear for your soul.</i>

01:20:10.762 --> 01:20:13.547
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:16.550
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:19.727
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:22.774
<i>It's never too late
to do the right thing.</i>

01:20:24.471 --> 01:20:25.777
What am I doing?

01:20:27.779 --> 01:20:28.954
What am I doing?

01:20:29.955 --> 01:20:31.348
What have I done?

01:20:39.704 --> 01:20:41.314
<i>Bye!</i>

01:20:41.401 --> 01:20:42.794
Bye, sweetie. See you, Roger.

01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:50.236
What's up, Shelly?

01:20:50.323 --> 01:20:51.716
<i>Have you heard from Ryder?</i>

01:20:51.803 --> 01:20:53.283
No! Why do you ask?

01:20:53.457 --> 01:20:55.633
Because he's gone.

01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:04.729
He said to give you this.

01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:08.820
You know...

01:21:10.343 --> 01:21:11.388
But I'm...

01:21:12.215 --> 01:21:15.044
Ooh, I'm gonna give you this.

01:21:24.444 --> 01:21:26.446
I'm so glad you could join us.

01:21:28.753 --> 01:21:30.711
What makes you so sure
that I am?

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:32.800
I'm not.

01:21:33.453 --> 01:21:37.283
The only certainty with chaos
is that there is no certainty.

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:40.286
But you're willing
to play the game.

01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.468
I'm calling it off, gentlemen.

01:21:48.642 --> 01:21:50.122
Why, pray tell?

01:21:50.688 --> 01:21:52.516
I'm not kidnapping a child.

01:21:52.777 --> 01:21:54.561
God knows you've done worse.

01:21:54.648 --> 01:21:58.043
Maybe I have...
but not this time.

01:21:58.478 --> 01:22:00.698
What exactly are you saying?

01:22:00.785 --> 01:22:03.309
It's never too late
to do the right thing.

01:22:04.571 --> 01:22:08.619
Ho!

01:22:10.621 --> 01:22:13.145
Let's go.

01:22:13.798 --> 01:22:16.235
Jack, I've called it off.

01:22:16.583 --> 01:22:20.065
It's over, gentlemen.
Go home. Go home.

01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:27.768
Jack.

01:22:28.508 --> 01:22:30.075
Jack, Jack!

01:22:44.568 --> 01:22:45.830
At least, you tried.

01:22:56.275 --> 01:22:57.842
Jack works for me now.

01:22:58.625 --> 01:23:00.932
You pay him well,
I pay him better.

01:23:02.847 --> 01:23:05.328
His talents were wasted
in your service.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:09.201
He could never reach
his full potential with you.

01:23:17.601 --> 01:23:18.776
Ciao, ciao, Paul.

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:38.361
See you later!

01:23:39.927 --> 01:23:40.972
Bye-bye!

01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.272
What if I just sit back
and watch...

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:22.361
and don't take part?

01:24:23.188 --> 01:24:24.320
That works.

01:24:26.322 --> 01:24:28.802
But if you pull the trigger,
it's even better.

01:24:29.455 --> 01:24:30.891
That which you most need,

01:24:30.978 --> 01:24:34.112
you'll find in the things
you don't want to do.

01:24:35.635 --> 01:24:39.596
Pull the trigger,
you will be loved.

01:24:41.424 --> 01:24:44.296
Love? How?

01:24:44.383 --> 01:24:46.124
Oh, my dear boy,
I thought you knew.

01:24:46.211 --> 01:24:48.126
Love is chaos.

01:25:18.156 --> 01:25:19.288
Go, go, go, go! Go!

01:26:04.681 --> 01:26:06.291
Nobody needs to get hurt.

01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:16.997
It's over!

01:26:17.476 --> 01:26:19.174
It's over! Put the guns down!

01:26:20.914 --> 01:26:23.613
Get out of here. Go, go!

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:25.310
Get out of here!

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:28.487
Let them go! Let them go!

01:26:30.968 --> 01:26:32.361
Fuck it!

01:27:24.151 --> 01:27:25.631
Where do I know you from?

01:27:30.114 --> 01:27:32.247
We've done this before.

01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:48.888
There are many times.

01:29:14.392 --> 01:29:16.612
Yes. Go on.

01:29:18.178 --> 01:29:20.529
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:28.406
Yes!

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.244
Maybe I will.

01:30:02.875 --> 01:30:06.444
Such a surprise.

01:31:11.335 --> 01:31:12.641
Stay in the car!

01:31:17.341 --> 01:31:18.821
I'm okay. Check on him.

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:22.738
Are you hit?

01:31:23.608 --> 01:31:25.392
You hang in there.
Medics are on the way.

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.525
You hear me? You hang in there.

01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:29.571
And thanks for the call.

01:31:29.875 --> 01:31:31.660
The little girl is safe.

01:31:37.883 --> 01:31:39.581
Ryder!

01:31:39.711 --> 01:31:42.148
Oh, my God!

01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:49.329
I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:32:09.698 --> 01:32:10.916
Thank you!

01:32:17.401 --> 01:32:18.489
What's your name?

01:32:58.921 --> 01:33:00.792
Why did you risk your life
for us?

01:33:03.490 --> 01:33:05.623
It was the right thing to do.

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:40.892
Hey...

01:34:46.637 --> 01:34:48.770
See you next time, Ryder.

01:35:31.290 --> 01:35:33.336
Bye!

01:36:06.499 --> 01:36:08.066
How did things resolve?

01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:11.243
They resolved.

01:36:12.331 --> 01:36:14.377
People can surprise you,

01:36:14.464 --> 01:36:15.813
like Paul Sanborn.

01:36:16.248 --> 01:36:18.729
- You know about that?
- No, I don't miss much!

01:36:18.903 --> 01:36:21.384
And the other man,
did you learn anything?

01:36:23.429 --> 01:36:24.517
Yeah.

01:36:26.432 --> 01:36:28.217
Yeah, he told me
that I'd never get to know love,

01:36:28.304 --> 01:36:29.261
but...

01:36:30.654 --> 01:36:31.655
that's not true.

01:36:33.526 --> 01:36:35.267
I do know love, I just...

01:36:36.138 --> 01:36:37.443
don't get to keep it
for very long,

01:36:37.530 --> 01:36:38.575
but nobody ever does.

01:36:38.662 --> 01:36:39.924
I like that!

01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:43.885
I think I'll steal it
when anyone asks me about love.

01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:46.975
- If that's okay?
- By all means.

01:36:47.236 --> 01:36:49.847
How are things
with you and Morgan?

01:36:52.067 --> 01:36:53.111
They're good.

01:36:54.286 --> 01:36:55.505
Are you sure?

01:37:39.331 --> 01:37:40.419
I get it.

01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:42.465
Good.

01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:45.511
I hate trying
to explain to people

01:37:45.598 --> 01:37:46.773
that they are dead.

01:37:46.904 --> 01:37:48.863
They never want to believe me.

01:37:59.786 --> 01:38:00.831
Thank you.

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:07.969
Ah... young love!

01:38:16.281 --> 01:38:17.369
I have to go.

01:38:17.935 --> 01:38:18.980
For now.
