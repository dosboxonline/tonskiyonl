00:27.527 --> 00:31.072
MISS MINUTES: Long ago,
there was a vast multiversal war,

00:31.156 --> 00:34.743
nearly resulting in the total
destruction of everything.

00:34.826 --> 00:38.747
But then, the all-knowing Time-Keepers
created the TVA

00:38.830 --> 00:40.957
and all its incredible workers.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.042
There's our variant.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.918
The TVA has stepped in

00:44.002 --> 00:46.796
to set time back
on its predetermined path.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.339
Reset it.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.424
SYLVIE: Wait!

00:53.261 --> 00:55.764
MISS MINUTES: Welcome to
the Time Variance Authority.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.892
MAN: ...reporting a code 000.

00:58.975 --> 01:01.019
Branches rapidly forming at a slope...

01:01.102 --> 01:02.729
Somebody just bombed the Sacred Timeline.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.314
RENSLAYER: Do you have any idea

01:04.397 --> 01:06.858
how impossible it is
to keep the timeline stable?

01:06.941 --> 01:10.236
The Time-Keepers are all that stand
between us and full-scale calamity.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.822
MOBIUS: How are the old Time-Keepers?

01:13.490 --> 01:14.908
RENSLAYER: How do you think?

01:14.991 --> 01:16.493
They want that Variant caught.

01:16.576 --> 01:17.660
So do I.

01:19.996 --> 01:22.082
-Yeah.
-Is that my jet ski magazine? Put it down.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.208
Come on. Gear up.

01:24.042 --> 01:26.294
LOKI: I was told that
everyone who works for the TVA

01:26.377 --> 01:27.879
was created by the Time-Keepers.

01:27.962 --> 01:29.214
That's ridiculous.

01:29.297 --> 01:30.507
You're all Variants!

01:30.590 --> 01:32.550
Everyone who works at the TVA.

01:33.051 --> 01:36.471
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline,

01:36.554 --> 01:38.181
and erased your memories.

01:38.515 --> 01:40.725
Did Loki say anything
while you were in there?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.143
He said the TVA is lying to me.

01:43.561 --> 01:46.231
I'm a Variant. So are you.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.942
So is every single person in this place.

01:49.484 --> 01:50.527
You were right.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.654
You were right from the beginning
about the TVA.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.074
RENSLAYER: Gracious Time-Keepers,

01:56.157 --> 01:59.369
as promised, the Variants.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.955
After all your struggle,

02:02.705 --> 02:05.291
at last, you've arrived before us.

02:05.959 --> 02:07.836
-Delete them.
-No, I'm not done with you yet.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.130
(STATIC)

02:14.634 --> 02:15.760
(BEEPS)

02:18.513 --> 02:19.889
Protect the Time-Keepers!

02:30.275 --> 02:31.734
(LAUGHING)

02:37.115 --> 02:38.741
SYLVIE: Poor Judge Renslayer.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.577
Your whole reality's been destroyed.

02:42.495 --> 02:43.788
RENSLAYER: You freed the Variant.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.875
-You were disloyal to the TVA.
-HUNTER B-15: Disloyal?

02:46.958 --> 02:49.919
-Did you think you'd escape punishment?
-Disloyal to who?

02:50.003 --> 02:53.047
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers.
They weren't real.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.966
And why do you think
that changes anything?

02:55.049 --> 02:56.050
That changes everything!

02:56.634 --> 02:59.220
MOBIUS: I think people are ready
to hear a little truth now.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.805
You know, like the TVA is a lie.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.390
But what if it's a necessary one?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.851
Someone created the Time-Keepers.

03:04.934 --> 03:05.935
Hey, y'all.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.272
RENSLAYER: They created this whole place.
They gave us all purpose.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.566
I have to believe they had a reason.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.944
I ended the Multiversal War.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.447
Once I isolated our timeline...

03:17.530 --> 03:19.908
MISS MINUTES: The Sacred Timeline.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.202
...all I had to do
was manage the flow of time

03:22.285 --> 03:24.287
and prevent any further branches.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.876
The universe wants to break free,
so it manifests chaos.

03:31.878 --> 03:32.962
What're you doing?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.881
I know the TVA has hurt us both.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.507
But what if by taking him out,

03:36.799 --> 03:39.177
we risk unleashing something even worse?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.054
What was I thinking trusting you?

03:42.555 --> 03:43.723
(GRUNTS)

03:44.766 --> 03:45.767
I'll see you soon.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.728
MOBIUS: No turning back now.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.730
Who said anything about turning back?
