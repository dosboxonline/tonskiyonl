Morning!

08:16.791 --> 08:19.332
Mm-hmm.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.208
99% of your devotion is about food.

08:22.875 --> 08:24.540
1% is about love.

08:26.291 --> 08:28.166
How is your spine, Ferruccio?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.374
As fragile as a twig, the doctor said.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.791
Hmm. So you should be careful.

08:34.458 --> 08:37.790
When I ask you to do something,
you should occasionally tell me no.

08:37.791 --> 08:39.250
I am careful, madam.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.208
That is why I don't dare to tell you no.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.166
Bonjour.

08:44.833 --> 08:45.791
Buongiorno<i>.</i>

08:46.291 --> 08:48.207
I slept until two,

08:48.208 --> 08:49.958
and then he came into my room.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.166
And I said in a very clear voice,

08:52.750 --> 08:54.250
"I know you are dead."

08:55.250 --> 08:56.333
And he went away?

08:56.875 --> 08:59.749
And he went away,
which is very unlike him.

09:02.708 --> 09:06.832
Perhaps when... when men are dead,
they become more manageable.

09:06.833 --> 09:08.540
Perhaps.

09:10.208 --> 09:11.582
Anyway, madam,

09:11.583 --> 09:14.291
a doctor is coming today at 11:00.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.958
Ferruccio made the appointment for you.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.541
I cannot see a doctor today. I am busy.

09:22.625 --> 09:25.165
You can tell him
about the visions you are having,

09:25.166 --> 09:27.416
and no doubt
he will change your medication.

09:27.916 --> 09:32.000
I'm perfectly happy
with my medication and its effects.

09:33.708 --> 09:36.541
I am happy with the theater
behind my eyes.

09:37.125 --> 09:40.125
Doctors often label revelation as illness,

09:40.625 --> 09:44.500
when in fact it is a form of sanity
they don't understand.

09:46.166 --> 09:47.000
Right?

09:49.833 --> 09:51.875
Madam, if I may ask,

09:52.708 --> 09:54.458
you will be busy doing what?

09:55.750 --> 09:58.291
Bruna, I want you to listen.

09:59.375 --> 10:01.041
And I want you to be honest.

12:08.166 --> 12:09.000
magnificent.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.250
Thank you.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.165
How is that for a position
for the piano, madam?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.166
Hmm.

12:24.750 --> 12:25.833
It's not right.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.041
But I'm nice, so leave it.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.165
Oh, there is a television camera crew
coming to interview me in about an hour.

12:34.166 --> 12:36.249
Perhaps hide the ashtrays.

13:41.250 --> 13:44.124
-  May I come in, madam?
- Only if you must.

13:51.333 --> 13:52.500
What did you take?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.125
I took liberties all my life.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.291
And the world took liberties with me.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.916
You know what I mean, madam.

14:01.416 --> 14:03.250
This morning, I took only Mandrax.

14:05.208 --> 14:06.333
How many?

14:07.625 --> 14:08.458
Two.

14:13.708 --> 14:16.833
I need to go somewhere
and I want Mandrax to accompany me.

14:17.500 --> 14:21.166
Mandrax is not a reliable
companion if you are going out.

14:21.708 --> 14:23.124
I will drive you.

14:23.125 --> 14:25.791
- Where are you going?
- I will walk.

14:27.083 --> 14:28.291
'Cause you would laugh.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.583
What did Bruna say
about your singing?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.790
She said it was magnificent.

14:36.791 --> 14:38.125
She's a housemaid.

14:38.666 --> 14:41.458
And housemaids, of course,
cannot know opera?

14:42.041 --> 14:44.375
They are not qualified
to judge it.

14:46.625 --> 14:47.791
I know where you are going.

14:50.416 --> 14:52.457
She said it was "magnificent,"

14:52.458 --> 14:55.290
and before, she said it was "excellent."

14:55.291 --> 14:56.208
So...

14:56.708 --> 14:58.750
And so "magnificent" means

14:59.708 --> 15:01.291
you have decided to try?

15:02.291 --> 15:05.083
Yes. On the word of a housemaid.

15:06.375 --> 15:08.875
- Madam, this television crew...
-  Hmm?

15:09.375 --> 15:10.750
Is it real?

15:12.166 --> 15:14.958
I'd like you to move the piano
to the other window.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.750
And as of this morning,

15:19.291 --> 15:21.875
what is real and what is not real

15:22.458 --> 15:23.708
is my business.

15:24.750 --> 15:26.125
Yes, madam.

15:26.750 --> 15:30.082
Oh! And I won't be here
for the doctor's appointment

15:30.083 --> 15:32.083
you made without my permission.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.000
Madam, you must...

15:34.750 --> 15:37.333
Don't cancel. Have them look at your back.

15:38.125 --> 15:39.875
You're becoming a little crooked.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.875
In case the television crew <i>are</i> real.

16:11.208 --> 16:12.791
- Madam Callas.
-  Mm.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.958
My name is Mandrax.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.665
I'd like to walk with you
through your life.

16:19.666 --> 16:20.707
Mm.

16:20.708 --> 16:24.916
A handsome interrogator
always gets the most honest answers.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.708
Should I call you Maria or La Callas?

16:28.208 --> 16:29.916
Either is perfectly fine.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.291
I prefer La Callas.

16:32.791 --> 16:34.416
Then that is perfectly fine.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.125
Unless, of course, you feel
you're a victim of that identity?

16:38.708 --> 16:39.541
Oh.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.332
So much has been written about me,

16:42.333 --> 16:44.833
and many unfair things.

16:45.791 --> 16:49.166
Stories that are... pure fabrication.

16:55.208 --> 16:56.040
Shall we sit?

16:56.041 --> 16:56.958
<i>Okay, roll.</i>

16:59.041 --> 17:00.208
Rolling.

17:03.958 --> 17:06.166
I am quite rebellious by nature.

17:07.916 --> 17:10.875
I heard a story once
that you burned all your dresses.

17:11.625 --> 17:12.625
What dresses?

17:13.416 --> 17:14.833
Your old theater costumes.

17:15.750 --> 17:17.124
That is true.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.208
Bravo.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.708
This will be worthwhile.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.833
I burnt my dresses before I left Milan.

17:25.875 --> 17:27.249
May I ask why?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.791
No, you may not.

17:31.166 --> 17:33.624
Uh, then, when did you
last perform on stage?

17:33.625 --> 17:36.375
You really should be more
persistent with your questions.

17:36.875 --> 17:40.125
I burnt my theater dresses,
because they were a part of the past.

17:40.666 --> 17:44.125
And to answer your...
less interesting question,

17:45.083 --> 17:47.458
I last performed
four-and-a-half years ago.

17:47.958 --> 17:52.750
Because performing on stage
is also a part of the past.

17:53.583 --> 17:55.291
You'll never perform again?

17:56.166 --> 17:57.083
No.

18:00.541 --> 18:02.583
Then tell me how it felt to be on stage?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.541
An exaltation.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.125
An intoxication.

18:09.375 --> 18:13.291
Sometimes I thought
the stage itself would burn.

18:15.791 --> 18:17.125
And on the bad days?

18:18.166 --> 18:20.374
Well, there are two sides.

18:20.375 --> 18:23.083
One side says to fight.

18:24.250 --> 18:29.166
And the other says, "You are awful,
and you should be ashamed."

18:31.958 --> 18:34.833
I'm afraid audiences expect miracles.

18:36.208 --> 18:38.208
I can no longer perform miracles.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.750
Perhaps we could speak a little
of your life away from the stage.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.625
There is no life away from the stage.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.000
The stage is in my mind.

18:52.958 --> 18:54.040
I have to go.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.750
- Go?
-  Yes.

18:56.458 --> 18:58.124
No, we were promised three hours.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.332
Then come with me.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.583
Come with you where?

19:01.541 --> 19:04.083
"Come with me," said the Diva,

19:04.625 --> 19:07.041
and there was really no need to ask where.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.333
Then I will come with you,
wherever you're going.

19:13.666 --> 19:15.208
Walk with me across Paris.

19:15.916 --> 19:19.833
My butler says that Mandrax
is a very unreliable companion, but

19:20.750 --> 19:22.583
I think we're a perfect combination.

22:12.708 --> 22:13.666
Hmm.

22:15.583 --> 22:18.832
You're casting breadcrumbs
as if I were a blackbird...

22:19.791 --> 22:21.707
...and the stage a bird table.

22:21.708 --> 22:22.708
Hmm?

22:23.416 --> 22:24.666
It won't work, of course.

22:27.083 --> 22:29.790
Although I sang
for Bruna this morning,

22:29.791 --> 22:33.166
and she said
she thought I was magnificent.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.250
Who's Bruna?

22:37.791 --> 22:39.125
Bruna is my housekeeper.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.666
She was making an omelet.

22:42.375 --> 22:45.291
She makes magnificent... omelets.

22:46.916 --> 22:48.416
She knows little about opera.

22:48.916 --> 22:51.000
And what she knows, she learned from me.

22:51.500 --> 22:55.750
And what she has learned from me
is to always be complimentary.

22:56.458 --> 23:01.750
So I am here on the word
of an obedient housemaid.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.457
You know, blackbirds have a song.

23:11.458 --> 23:15.208
If you buy a recording,
on the label it just says,

23:16.250 --> 23:17.750
"Blackbird Song."

23:20.291 --> 23:24.375
There must be a song
just called "Human Song."

23:26.291 --> 23:28.166
I'd like to sing it before I stop.

23:28.958 --> 23:29.875
Stop?

23:31.833 --> 23:32.750
Maria...

23:34.375 --> 23:38.208
You said you'd come here and at least
find out if you still have a voice.

23:41.791 --> 23:44.457
I'm not a répétiteur.
I'm not here to teach you.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.750
I couldn't teach you anyway.

23:48.208 --> 23:51.000
But if I hear, I will know.

23:52.750 --> 23:53.875
Puccini will know.

23:54.375 --> 23:57.540
Puccini is dead,
and he may be glad that he is.

24:01.500 --> 24:05.666
Why don't we just stand here and look out
as if it was the edge of the future?

24:09.916 --> 24:11.250
What do you want to sing?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.125
A love song.

24:14.875 --> 24:17.625
-  And who are you in love with?
- Guess.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.208
Ugly and dead.

24:20.291 --> 24:22.333
- Mr. Onassis still?
-  Mm.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.083
He comes to my bed every night.

24:29.250 --> 24:32.625
He won't leave me alone.
I... I love sending him away though.

24:34.416 --> 24:35.790
When did you last perform?

24:37.458 --> 24:38.625
A long time ago.

24:39.916 --> 24:40.958
It made me sick.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.625
I got a hernia and purple legs.

24:44.958 --> 24:47.666
Everything swelled, except my ego.

24:50.125 --> 24:51.082
I was in Japan,

24:51.083 --> 24:54.124
and all the Japanese doctors said,
"What is this thing?"

24:54.125 --> 24:57.624
And my people said,
"Well, this is La Divina, La Prima Donna."

24:57.625 --> 25:00.915
And they said, "But then
why does she look like a purple frog?"

25:05.916 --> 25:07.666
So I came back to Paris.

25:09.125 --> 25:13.290
And I sit in my apartment,
look out the window, and I say,

25:13.291 --> 25:15.624
"Ticktock, ticktock. The brute is dead."

25:15.625 --> 25:18.416
"My voice has gone. What do I do now?"

25:21.750 --> 25:24.124
I have my car.

25:24.125 --> 25:26.207
I can drive you back to your prison cell

25:26.208 --> 25:28.583
on Avenue Georges-Mandel
if that's what you want.

25:29.083 --> 25:30.041
Mm.

25:30.583 --> 25:33.832
Bruna is my mother, my sister,

25:33.833 --> 25:36.416
my daughter, my housemaid.

25:37.333 --> 25:40.707
Ferruccio is my father, my son,
my brother, my butler.

25:40.708 --> 25:43.833
It is a terribly crowded apartment.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.083
I don't want to go just yet.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.790
Okay, so I have an idea.

25:51.791 --> 25:54.957
You're evidently mad
about something, or scared,

25:54.958 --> 25:57.125
or bitter, or whatever it is,

25:58.041 --> 25:59.166
so don't sing.

26:01.291 --> 26:02.291
Shout.

26:04.000 --> 26:06.832
Shout so loud even Puccini can hear.

26:09.000 --> 26:13.541
So loud, ugly, dead Onassis can hear.

26:34.291 --> 26:39.832
<i>♪ O mio babbino caro ♪</i>

26:39.833 --> 26:46.207
<i>♪ Mi piace è bello, bello ♪</i>

26:46.208 --> 26:52.207
<i>♪ Vo'andare in Porta Rossa ♪</i>

26:52.208 --> 26:57.624
<i>♪ A comperar l'anello! ♪</i>

26:57.625 --> 27:02.625
<i>♪ Sì, sì, ci voglio andare! ♪</i>

27:03.375 --> 27:09.707

27:16.166 --> 27:19.040
<i>♪ Ma per buttar--♪</i>

27:28.000 --> 27:29.166
Ugh.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.541
That was Maria singing.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.125
I want to hear La Callas.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.875
It will not happen in one day.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.958
Puccini and I will be here tomorrow,
same time!

28:52.416 --> 28:54.000
-  Madam?
-  Mm?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.166
I asked the doctor
to wait for you.

28:58.416 --> 28:59.750
Dr. Fontainebleau,

29:00.583 --> 29:01.666
Maria Callas.

29:02.666 --> 29:05.125
I'm a huge admirer of your work.

29:05.958 --> 29:06.958
Hmm.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.458
And how is my butler's back?

29:11.291 --> 29:14.124
Oh, there is no cure for it

29:14.125 --> 29:16.541
other than stop moving pianos.

29:17.375 --> 29:18.500
Hmm.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.082
I showed him the diary,

29:21.083 --> 29:23.583
the medicines
that you are taking every day.

29:26.250 --> 29:27.125
Hmm.

29:27.833 --> 29:31.874
I have a strange feeling
sharing someone's medical information

29:31.875 --> 29:33.333
is against the law.

29:34.916 --> 29:37.165
- No?
-  Madame? Uh...

29:37.166 --> 29:38.082
Mm?

29:38.083 --> 29:40.541
I need to have a conversation with you

29:41.250 --> 29:42.583
about life and death.

29:43.666 --> 29:45.832
About sanity and insanity.

29:57.291 --> 29:59.083
The piano is in a good place.

30:01.041 --> 30:02.041
Thank you.

30:13.291 --> 30:14.750
Madame, please.

30:27.750 --> 30:30.208
<i>I'm going to cook,
and she will be better.</i>

30:32.708 --> 30:33.875
She's too skinny.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.458
She hasn't eaten for three days.

30:40.375 --> 30:43.041
Last time, she didn't eat
for four days, so...

30:46.041 --> 30:47.208
...we're still okay.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.208
Hmm?

30:58.041 --> 31:02.208
Yeah, but then you're going to prepare it,
and she'll give it to the dogs, as usual.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.000
Madam?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.500
Leave me alone.

32:01.916 --> 32:03.375
Madam, I have made coffee.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.415
Mm-hmm.

32:07.416 --> 32:08.791
Madam, also,

32:10.000 --> 32:11.875
there is a message for you.

32:12.875 --> 32:14.374
-  Mm?
- From the pianist.

32:14.375 --> 32:17.332
He said,
uh, no matter what happens,

32:17.333 --> 32:19.790
you must go to see him again tomorrow.

32:19.791 --> 32:22.541
He said he heard hope in your voice.

32:25.333 --> 32:27.207
I thought that might be a good thing.

32:27.208 --> 32:29.582
- I thought that, uh...
- Mm?

32:29.583 --> 32:30.958
It might make you happy.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.250
The medicine cabinet is unlocked.

32:38.458 --> 32:39.791
You can throw it all away.

32:41.291 --> 32:44.415
Ah, um, that is not
what the doctor told us we should do.

32:44.416 --> 32:46.000
Was he even a doctor?

32:46.958 --> 32:49.041
He's a specialist, madam.

32:49.666 --> 32:51.500
And what does he specialize in?

32:52.208 --> 32:53.041
Blood.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.082
That is why he took
a sample of your blood.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.875
But he said, even before
the result of the test,

32:59.666 --> 33:01.832
we should get your medication
under control.

33:01.833 --> 33:03.374
It is under control.

33:03.375 --> 33:04.999
It's under <i>my</i> control.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.875
And doctors hate that.

33:09.000 --> 33:13.041
I need you to make me an appointment
with a hairdresser that doesn't speak.

33:14.583 --> 33:17.207
And when I write my autobiography,

33:17.208 --> 33:20.832
I will title it
<i>The Day Ferruccio Saved My Life.</i>

33:20.833 --> 33:23.290
And what day was that, madam?

33:23.291 --> 33:25.541
Every day. Every single day.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.458
That's why I hate you.

33:28.041 --> 33:31.791
I fall into a river,
and you always fish me out.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.583
Yes, madam.

33:36.958 --> 33:40.125
Book me a table at the café
where the waiters know who I am.

33:40.958 --> 33:42.541
I'm in the mood for adulation.

34:12.875 --> 34:14.957
-  Madame Callas.
-  Hmm.

34:14.958 --> 34:19.208
I just wanted to say that once,
in New York, you broke my heart.

34:19.833 --> 34:20.915
What aria?

34:20.916 --> 34:23.457
No, no, you broke my heart
because I bought two tickets

34:23.458 --> 34:25.333
and you failed to appear.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.332
They said you were unwell, so...

34:27.333 --> 34:29.166
- C'est la vie.
- Then I was unwell.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.165
It's okay. No hard feelings.

34:31.166 --> 34:34.040
-  I was unwell.
- Madame, it's okay.

34:34.041 --> 34:36.582
I forgot about it
until I saw you just now.

34:36.583 --> 34:40.750
People always said I was faking it.
I was never faking it.

34:41.666 --> 34:44.375
You have no idea, no idea of the pain

34:44.875 --> 34:49.375
to pull music through your belly,
out your poor mouth.

34:50.458 --> 34:51.750
No idea!

35:00.416 --> 35:01.375
Madame.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.458
Perhaps we can find you a seat inside.

35:04.958 --> 35:06.125
I'm not hungry.

35:07.750 --> 35:10.041
I come to restaurants to be adored.

35:13.625 --> 35:14.500
Please.

35:33.625 --> 35:34.500
Thank you.

36:02.708 --> 36:06.375
May I say that tonight
you defined Violetta forever.

36:07.291 --> 36:08.958
You <i>are</i> Violetta.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.249
- Maria.
-  Hmm.

36:17.250 --> 36:20.083
-  Where have you been?
-  I think you know.

36:20.583 --> 36:22.165
-  Excuse me.
-  Mm?

36:22.166 --> 36:25.041
My English no good, but flower says it.

36:25.791 --> 36:27.458
Magnificent <i>Traviata</i>.

36:28.166 --> 36:29.040
Mm.

36:29.041 --> 36:32.208
- Tonight, everyone wants to worship you.
- Mm.

36:32.750 --> 36:35.291
Excuse me, Madame Callas.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.290
There is someone
who's just dying to meet you.

36:39.291 --> 36:41.874
I wondered if you would
make his day, his week,

36:41.875 --> 36:44.000
his month, his life.

36:45.708 --> 36:49.040
Excuse me, sir, may I borrow
your wife just for a few moments?

36:49.041 --> 36:52.333
-  I think there is a queue.
- No, I don't queue.

36:58.916 --> 36:59.916
<i>Who are you?</i>

37:00.666 --> 37:02.083
Aristotle Onassis.

37:02.833 --> 37:05.041
This is my party, thrown in your honor.

37:06.291 --> 37:10.250
And if you want to count them,
I got a thousand pink roses just for you.

37:12.750 --> 37:15.207
I was told it was a smart thing to do

37:15.208 --> 37:18.625
to associate myself
with the Prima Donna Assoluta.

37:19.833 --> 37:23.124
So this party was a business strategy.

37:23.125 --> 37:24.040
Hmm.

37:24.041 --> 37:25.500
But then I fell in love.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.666
- You fell in love with opera.
- No.

37:29.375 --> 37:30.833
I fell in love with you.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.041
Hmm.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.375
I'm ugly, but I'm rich.

37:41.708 --> 37:44.500
I'm Greek, but I'm from Argentina.

37:45.625 --> 37:46.708
I'm married,

37:47.625 --> 37:49.333
but it's 1959.

37:50.041 --> 37:50.875
So...

37:51.916 --> 37:54.625
To falling in love through binoculars.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.250
I watched you through these.

37:59.333 --> 38:00.332
You love me,

38:00.333 --> 38:03.249
and yet you've never
set eyes on me before tonight.

38:03.250 --> 38:04.957
Oh!

38:04.958 --> 38:06.333
Now I'm offended.

38:07.125 --> 38:08.999
- We met.
- Hmm?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.416
In Venice. At the film festival.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.832
But I guess there were
a lot of movie stars,

38:14.833 --> 38:17.375
so you forgot the little ugly guy.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.875
Well, I didn't forget you.

38:22.500 --> 38:23.750
Do you want to dance?

38:25.541 --> 38:27.583
I should get back to my husband.

38:28.875 --> 38:31.124
You will never go back to your husband.

38:31.125 --> 38:32.041
Hmm.

38:33.791 --> 38:36.082
Sometimes this thing happens,

38:36.083 --> 38:38.874
the thing... that's happening right now.

38:38.875 --> 38:42.083
And what is the thing
that is happening right now? Hmm?

38:42.666 --> 38:44.082
A decision is made.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.708
Not by anyone, but

38:46.208 --> 38:47.791
it's how it's going to be.

38:50.166 --> 38:52.041
I'm sorry, Mr. Onassis.

38:52.958 --> 38:55.290
Am I supposed to be feeling something?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.416
Yes.

38:57.375 --> 38:59.000
For the first time in your life.

39:02.750 --> 39:03.666
Well.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.707
There's a point where self-confidence
becomes a kind of insanity.

39:09.750 --> 39:13.000
I crossed that border long, long ago.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.499
I don't mean to be abrupt.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.499
Oh, I think I can confidently say

39:17.500 --> 39:18.707
you are being abrupt.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.374
"Abrupt" might not even be
a strong enough word for what you are.

39:24.375 --> 39:27.625
- But there is a ship, my ship.
- Mm-hmm?

39:28.166 --> 39:29.665
- Called the <i>Christina</i>.
- Yes.

39:29.666 --> 39:33.124
Sailing from Monte Carlo to Greece
on the 21st of July.

39:33.125 --> 39:34.041
Mm-hmm?

39:34.875 --> 39:36.332
I'd love you to be on board.

39:40.083 --> 39:41.208
I get it.

39:41.708 --> 39:44.082
There's a lot of people
who want a piece of her,

39:44.083 --> 39:45.957
and my time is up, I get it.

39:45.958 --> 39:48.707
But I was just telling your wife

39:48.708 --> 39:52.000
that I've arranged a cruise
from Monte Carlo

39:52.583 --> 39:55.332
and invited the most illustrious people.

39:55.333 --> 39:57.124
And I was just telling her

39:57.125 --> 39:59.832
that it would be an absolute honor

39:59.833 --> 40:03.833
if you and your wife
would join me on board.

40:04.875 --> 40:06.208
And guess what she said.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.208
And I said, "Yes."

40:10.750 --> 40:11.958
"Why not?"

40:13.750 --> 40:16.000
And my husband agreed.

40:17.208 --> 40:18.041
Hmm.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.707
There is a very common theory...

40:22.708 --> 40:26.000
...that if you ask for something,
it means that you want it.

40:26.750 --> 40:27.916
It is not true.

40:30.250 --> 40:32.791
I didn't want to go on his yacht,

40:33.291 --> 40:35.500
because I knew where it would take me.

40:36.166 --> 40:37.625
And it took me there,

40:38.125 --> 40:40.791
to the place I did not want to go.

40:42.125 --> 40:43.583
But when I got there,

40:44.875 --> 40:45.958
I stayed.

40:47.833 --> 40:48.875
Madame.

40:49.833 --> 40:51.625
Madame Callas,

40:52.458 --> 40:54.624
my son has called your apartment,

40:54.625 --> 40:56.833
and someone is on their way to fetch you.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.083
Hmm.

41:02.958 --> 41:03.875
Uh...

41:04.375 --> 41:05.500
Another, please.

41:06.416 --> 41:07.291
Mm.

41:10.541 --> 41:11.583
I know you...

41:12.916 --> 41:15.375
I know you think my behavior is unusual.

41:16.541 --> 41:18.250
I'm actually working.

41:19.291 --> 41:20.458
Uh, writing something.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.375
What are you writing?

41:24.416 --> 41:25.750
An autobiography.

41:26.625 --> 41:27.666
An aria.

41:28.708 --> 41:29.875
A third act.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.000
"The Human Song."

41:33.958 --> 41:35.500
Something along those lines.

41:38.750 --> 41:40.207
I didn't know you wrote.

41:40.208 --> 41:42.166
Mm. Neither did I.

41:47.625 --> 41:49.583
I don't, uh... I don't use a pen.

41:50.833 --> 41:52.083
I use myself.

41:52.708 --> 41:57.875
It seems the part of me
that, uh, that dreams is

41:59.291 --> 42:00.790
taking the wheel of the ship

42:00.791 --> 42:04.041
and taking the ship into... safe harbor.

42:15.541 --> 42:16.916
Why are you kind to me?

42:22.916 --> 42:25.041
Because you're kind to us with this.

42:58.375 --> 42:59.750
Because it is perfect.

43:02.083 --> 43:04.541
And a song should never be perfect.

43:05.166 --> 43:08.500
It should be performed in that moment

44:38.666 --> 44:39.958
I think, yes.

44:41.666 --> 44:43.750
He might have said you "should" call him.

I "can" call him if I wish.

I don't know.

51:53.541 --> 51:57.000
I was with my sister,
which was part of the plan.

51:57.666 --> 52:00.208
-  What plan?
- Until you woke me up.

52:05.083 --> 52:08.749
How am I to sleep
when Ferruccio has taken all my pills?

52:08.750 --> 52:11.125
Ferruccio has gone
for coffee and croissants.

52:13.208 --> 52:14.708
Where is my medication?

52:15.833 --> 52:19.500
Dr. Fontainebleau said
we should keep them in the kitchen.

52:21.208 --> 52:22.666
Even the ones I hid?

52:26.375 --> 52:28.208
You went through my pockets.

52:32.833 --> 52:35.500
Also, you are going
to call the doctor today.

52:36.000 --> 52:40.333
No. No, today I have
an appointment with Bellini.

52:44.125 --> 52:45.082
- Madam.
- Mm?

52:45.083 --> 52:46.958
You can still call the doctor.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.541
Has a package arrived for me?

52:52.333 --> 52:56.916
Yes. A parcel from Athens,
from your sister, Yakinthi.

52:57.750 --> 52:59.083
Good.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.374
-  Okay.
-  Mm-hmm.

53:38.375 --> 53:39.500
Here is great.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.333
It looks great. It looks La Callas.

53:42.833 --> 53:46.833
Greek, grand, sad, framed by the past...

53:47.541 --> 53:51.041
Now, am I calling you Maria
or La Callas today?

53:51.750 --> 53:52.875
Today, Maria.

53:53.750 --> 53:55.540
- Here?
- Please, okay.

53:55.541 --> 53:57.290
- Okay, roll.
-  Rolling.

53:59.166 --> 54:00.041
Maria.

54:02.416 --> 54:05.208
I understand you're looking to make
something of a comeback.

54:06.250 --> 54:09.083
Not really. I have no intention
of performing on stage.

54:10.250 --> 54:13.208
I understood that you were seeking
to find your voice again.

54:14.291 --> 54:17.666
I am seeking something I lost.

54:19.333 --> 54:21.249
And why
do you want to sing again?

54:21.250 --> 54:25.832
Oh, because music is so enormous.

54:25.833 --> 54:28.833
It envelops you in a state of torture.

54:30.166 --> 54:32.000
- That is a reason?
-  Mm-mm.

54:32.625 --> 54:34.708
Music is born of misery.

54:35.291 --> 54:36.375
Of suffering.

54:37.083 --> 54:41.000
Happiness never produced
a beautiful melody.

54:43.000 --> 54:46.208
It seems, music is born of distress.

54:47.916 --> 54:49.000
And poverty.

54:52.041 --> 54:53.999
And you were born very poor.

54:54.000 --> 54:55.083
Mm, yes.

54:56.083 --> 54:57.833
I used to sing for money.

55:01.875 --> 55:03.832
I just realized last night,

55:03.833 --> 55:05.791
that is where it all began.

55:08.125 --> 55:09.125
Do you want coffee?

55:09.625 --> 55:11.915
No, I want courage.

55:11.916 --> 55:15.041
I want courage to be able to go
into this Mexican restaurant,

55:15.750 --> 55:18.791
and order a plate of fajitas
and cream and salsa.

55:20.166 --> 55:21.291
Why courage?

55:22.666 --> 55:27.208
Because the smell when I walk by here
each morning with my dogs reminds me

55:27.791 --> 55:31.250
of the day I finally
told my mother to fuck off.

55:33.083 --> 55:36.208
You should write a whole chapter
about it in the autobiography.

55:36.833 --> 55:42.124
You must call it <i>The Day
I Finally Told My Mother to Fuck Off</i>

55:42.125 --> 55:44.416
<i>in a Restaurant in Mexico.</i>

55:45.125 --> 55:46.790
It wasn't in a restaurant in Mexico.

55:48.625 --> 55:50.624
I asked Bruna to cook for her,

55:50.625 --> 55:53.041
because Bruna can cook anything.

55:54.125 --> 55:57.083
And my mother can ruin anything.

56:31.666 --> 56:34.749
This is the part of the film
where you're expected to sing, Maria.

56:34.750 --> 56:36.290
So fucking sing.

56:36.291 --> 56:38.415
La Callas is expected to sing.

56:38.416 --> 56:41.374
No excuses. No diva-imagined sickness.

56:41.375 --> 56:44.625
Not like Rome,
not like Covent Garden, not like New York.

56:45.208 --> 56:46.458
Fucking sing!

56:47.791 --> 56:50.708
I will sing when I am ready to sing.

58:04.208 --> 58:07.208
- Okay, so I had some thoughts overnight.
-  So did I.

58:08.208 --> 58:11.165
La Callas needs a spotlight.

58:11.166 --> 58:13.250
I asked one of the lighting guys. He's...

58:14.166 --> 58:15.083
He's up there.

58:16.666 --> 58:17.666
Pierre?

58:19.166 --> 58:20.166
Bonjour, madame.

58:21.750 --> 58:22.625
Bonjour.

58:23.958 --> 58:27.666
Only La Callas could make
a French theater technician miss lunch.

58:29.500 --> 58:33.750
But it's just you and me and the piano.

58:35.125 --> 58:37.208
-  And sweet Pierre.
- No, no.

58:37.708 --> 58:40.041
I asked him to give us the light,
then go away.

58:40.625 --> 58:41.708
This is private.

58:44.125 --> 58:46.916
But also, this is wherever the hell
you want it to be.

58:48.250 --> 58:52.166
New York, Covent Garden, La Scala...

58:55.041 --> 58:55.958
Venice.

58:57.833 --> 59:00.500
Venice, 1949.

59:01.458 --> 59:02.458
I was fat.

59:03.250 --> 59:04.832
Beautiful fat.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.875
- No, you were never fat.
- I was.

59:07.541 --> 59:09.957
I arrived by gondola
and thought I would sink it.

59:09.958 --> 59:12.250
Venice, '49...

59:13.500 --> 59:14.790
You were Elvira.

59:14.791 --> 59:15.916
Mm.

59:16.416 --> 59:18.625
Someone got sick
and you learned it in one week.

59:19.916 --> 59:21.166
And so it began.

59:23.708 --> 59:25.250
Do you know <i>I Puritani</i>?

59:26.250 --> 59:27.625

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:22.958
Not today.

01:02:46.416 --> 01:02:47.333
Great.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.749
You haven't really explained.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.083
What is this film you're making?

01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:58.500
It's called <i>La Callas: The Last Days</i>.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:02.166
Well, in that case,

01:03:03.541 --> 01:03:04.500
roll camera.

01:03:05.291 --> 01:03:06.791
Rolling.

Your baby.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.207
The one <i>he</i> wouldn't allow you to have.

01:03:17.208 --> 01:03:18.999
Well, that is true, isn't it?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.166
He got you pregnant and then
wouldn't allow you to have the baby.

01:03:26.958 --> 01:03:28.458
Just now,

01:03:29.291 --> 01:03:30.500
I was in Venice.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:32.582
Before him.

01:03:32.583 --> 01:03:33.750
Before love.

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:37.625
Slowly, slowly,
I am looking back at my life.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.499
<i>Seeing the truth.</i>

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.583
<i>I won at roulette.</i>

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.708
Perhaps he let you win.

01:04:20.416 --> 01:04:22.374
You cannot cheat at roulette.

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:25.082
Everyone can cheat at everything.

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:26.624
Especially these people.

01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:28.540
Hmm. What people?

01:04:32.375 --> 01:04:35.541
He doesn't even try to hide
his desire for you.

01:04:39.833 --> 01:04:42.290
I spoke to Winston Churchill.

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.041
The girl from Athens.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.833
For a Prima Donna,
pleasure is unavoidable.

01:04:49.333 --> 01:04:51.333
Are you quoting the bastard?

01:04:51.833 --> 01:04:55.125
No. I am saying my own thoughts out loud.

01:04:56.125 --> 01:04:57.250
It's a new thing.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:04:59.708
My thoughts. Out loud.

01:05:45.166 --> 01:05:48.291
The herald of the gods, Hermes.

01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:52.540
Hermes is my god.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.166
Hermes is myself.

01:05:55.583 --> 01:05:58.000
It dates from the second century BC.

01:05:59.666 --> 01:06:00.916
A rare beauty.

01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:04.415
I have no consideration for beauty.

01:06:04.416 --> 01:06:06.208
I myself am ugly,

01:06:07.166 --> 01:06:09.582
and I'm loyal to my tribe.

01:06:09.583 --> 01:06:12.207
You represent the opposite tribe.

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:14.625
I'm not a long a member of the tribe.

01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:17.332
I used to be part of your tribe.

01:06:17.333 --> 01:06:19.875
- I would have loved you then.
- Oh, no.

01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:23.040
I was unlovable. You can ask my mother.

01:06:24.958 --> 01:06:27.207
- Hermes is a busy god.
- Hmm.

01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:30.374
He is the protector
of travelers, merchants,

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.457
orators, and thieves.

01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:34.791
And you are all those things?

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.249
-  I'm a merchant.
- Mm.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.291
My ships travel the world.

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:42.416
I use oratory to get what I want.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:45.208
And if it doesn't work, I steal it.

01:06:47.416 --> 01:06:49.875
This statue, matchless,

01:06:50.708 --> 01:06:51.708
priceless...

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:57.333
I had it stolen to order
from a museum in Athens.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:07:00.333
No one knows it exists.

01:07:01.416 --> 01:07:04.166
Only those who come into this room
know I have it.

01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:05.708
Hmm.

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:07.750
So your wife.

01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.000
If I want something,

01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:12.500
I steal it.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.250
And you think <i>this</i> would be theft?

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.499
You think I <i>belong</i> to my husband,

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.666
and after we sleep together,
I will <i>belong</i> to you, hmm?

01:07:26.791 --> 01:07:29.582
To be a possession in a cabinet

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:31.332
is not my ambition.

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:43.166
And why do you think
Aristotle Onassis didn't marry you?

01:07:43.916 --> 01:07:47.499
Because he knew he could not control me.

01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:50.582
And it wasn't
that he didn't allow me to have a baby.

01:07:50.583 --> 01:07:53.333
Wait. Important truth. Mark it.

01:07:57.291 --> 01:07:58.166
Go on.

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:05.832
I didn't marry Aristotle Onassis,

01:08:05.833 --> 01:08:09.708
because he wanted
someone he could control.

01:08:10.208 --> 01:08:12.041
And I didn't have a baby because

01:08:12.666 --> 01:08:16.500
my body declined the invitation
to make another self.

01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:20.708
Because my body knew I was a tiger.

What are you doing?

01:09:37.833 --> 01:09:40.457
Preventing a visit
from the gendarmerie.

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:42.874
Opera at this volume is bad luck.

01:09:42.875 --> 01:09:45.499
Opera at this volume is American radio.

01:09:47.541 --> 01:09:50.291
Madam, you never listen
to recordings of yourself.

01:09:51.125 --> 01:09:53.208
While on a bridge, I made a decision.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.916
The dogs were afraid of the loud noise.

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:01.333
Did you buy what I asked you for?

01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.290
Yes.

01:10:03.291 --> 01:10:04.583
Unwrap it, please.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:09.958
What decision, madam?

01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.082
If I am to become La Callas,
I need to listen to La Callas.

01:10:15.083 --> 01:10:16.499
I have to record myself

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:19.958
and then compare myself to my past voice.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:26.374
Does it have a...?

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.999
Yeah, there...
there should be a cassette inside.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.083
Mm.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:32.665
Madam, today you said
you would call the doctor.

01:10:32.666 --> 01:10:33.958
Did you call the doctor?

01:10:35.125 --> 01:10:38.041
Bruna? I don't, ah, machines...

01:10:38.875 --> 01:10:41.125
Did you call Dr. Fontainebleau, madam?

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:50.249
Now it's recording, madam. You just--

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:54.458
Bruna, I would like you to bring
this machine with you tomorrow and record.

01:10:55.541 --> 01:10:57.999
Ferruccio, because of
your obsession with doctors,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.583
I would like you to stay back
and clean the car.

01:11:01.083 --> 01:11:03.540
And the piano is better
near the other window.

01:11:03.541 --> 01:11:05.375
Better for what, madam?

01:11:07.791 --> 01:11:09.458
Better for my purposes.

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:15.165
<i>Now it's recording, madam. You just--</i>

01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:19.416
<i>Bruna, I would like you to bring
this machine with you tomorrow and record.</i>

01:11:20.375 --> 01:11:22.874
<i>Ferruccio, because of
your obsession with doctors,</i>

01:11:22.875 --> 01:11:25.333
<i>I would like you to stay back
and clean the car.</i>

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.208
<i>Mm, don't spill.</i>

01:11:51.083 --> 01:11:52.582
-  <i>Oh.</i>
-  <i>No?</i>

01:11:52.583 --> 01:11:53.666
<i>Oh yes.</i>

01:11:55.666 --> 01:11:57.750
-  <i>Here, I'll give you some.
- Okay.</i>

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.916
Ask your questions.

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:06.166
Why... Why be
with such a brute like Onassis?

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:11.041
Because with him, I could...

01:12:12.750 --> 01:12:14.208
I could be a girl again.

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:56.291
<i>Piano, piano.</i>

01:13:03.041 --> 01:13:05.000
Did you give her her pills today?

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:07.083
No.

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:08.833
So who did, then?

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.666
There was a package from Yakinthi.

01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:30.500
I find carrying out simple instructions
a great comfort.

01:13:31.833 --> 01:13:33.458
As if things were normal again.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.041
When were they ever normal?

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:38.958
I think it was...

01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:43.083
one day, once, in 1964.

01:13:44.875 --> 01:13:47.040
It was a dull day, I imagine.

01:13:57.041 --> 01:13:57.875
Good.

01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:00.041
The piano is much better there.

01:14:01.458 --> 01:14:03.375
Both of you, put on nicer clothes.

01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:06.500
We're going out to celebrate my life.

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:21.041
I believe I'm expected.

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:25.332
I don't believe
you are, madam.

01:14:25.333 --> 01:14:28.333
Well, I believe I am,
and that's all that matters.

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:34.125
Wait here.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.833
Look, there. The king.

01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:46.750
That's me, right?

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:49.708
Will President Kennedy be coming?

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:53.916
He's probably up in the Gossamer Suite
fucking Marilyn Monroe.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.916
His wife will be here, sure enough.

01:14:57.583 --> 01:14:59.208
Why would you know that?

01:15:00.625 --> 01:15:03.791
How do you like the places
I take you to, hmm?

01:15:06.083 --> 01:15:10.041
- I like the painting.
- How do you like it, little Athens girl?

01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:16.375
- Please don't drink too much.
- Oh, baby, that bird has flown.

01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:19.415
You might even say thank you sometimes.

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:23.165
I just took you to the birthday party
for the President of the fucking--

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.291
Maria Callas?

01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:26.458
Oh my.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.207
I saw you at the Met, and oh my God.

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:31.874
Yeah, she is a goddess.

01:15:31.875 --> 01:15:33.874
She had me in tears,

01:15:33.875 --> 01:15:36.957
and my husband saying, "Okay, I get it."

01:15:36.958 --> 01:15:38.916
Hmm, yeah. She's a bird.

01:15:39.458 --> 01:15:40.916
She's a songbird.

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.666
I leave the cage door open,
but she doesn't want to fly.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:47.166
Excuse me, who are you?

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:52.249
Could you explain to this sweet lady

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:55.958
that I am the richest man
in this fucking room.

01:15:56.625 --> 01:16:00.041
Oh, here's the luckiest man alive.

01:16:01.041 --> 01:16:04.291
Have you seen his wife? Man! Phwoar!

01:16:06.416 --> 01:16:07.291
Mm.

01:16:07.916 --> 01:16:11.000
My dream is to see you perform
at the amphitheater in Athens.

01:16:12.250 --> 01:16:16.125
I'm told the acoustics are better
than anything in any modern theater.

01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:17.583
Yes.

01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.707
Do you have any plans to tour the States?

01:16:20.708 --> 01:16:22.665
Hi, Mr. President. Onassis.

01:16:22.666 --> 01:16:25.624
Um... uh, no. Not at this time.

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.750
I'm having some struggle with my voice.

01:16:28.291 --> 01:16:29.375
Oh.

01:16:30.041 --> 01:16:34.333
Well, maybe the songbird
should leave the cage occasionally.

even if you don't have a real voice?

01:17:06.083 --> 01:17:07.833
No one cares about her voice.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:11.041
Just as no one cares about your body.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:21.624
All clear.

I hear you were born in the United States.

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.125
I was. New York.

01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:50.915
Welcome home. May I?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.083
Would you sing for us in the White House?

01:17:59.583 --> 01:18:03.458
I don't think the White House
would much like my voice right now.

01:18:04.625 --> 01:18:06.458
So, Onassis...

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:09.791
He's your... whatever?

01:18:11.458 --> 01:18:13.290
Yes, he is my whatever.

01:18:13.291 --> 01:18:14.750
The father you never had.

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.708
And how do you know I never had a father?

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.291
The CIA has 17,000 college graduates
with listening devices finding things out.

01:18:30.333 --> 01:18:31.750
You look great, by the way.

01:18:32.250 --> 01:18:33.125
Thank you.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:34.708
You look tired.

01:18:36.625 --> 01:18:38.291
Never too tired for beauty.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:43.541
Your husband invited Jackie and me
to take a cruise on his yacht.

01:18:44.625 --> 01:18:47.249
I think you know he is not my husband.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.832
He is my whatever.

01:18:48.833 --> 01:18:51.500
Last night, he called you his wife.

01:18:52.458 --> 01:18:54.000
Maybe he plans to propose.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.750
Ari would look very funny on one knee.

01:18:58.375 --> 01:19:00.708
It would be great fun
to sail away with you.

01:19:02.125 --> 01:19:06.249
Mr. Onassis told me
he has an El Greco painting on his yacht

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:08.125
that he would like to show my wife.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:09.875
Hmm.

01:19:11.083 --> 01:19:11.958
Yes.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:14.083
In his bedroom.

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.250
You seem quite sad.

01:19:19.583 --> 01:19:21.625
Last night, before he fell to sleep,

01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:23.958
Ari told me he loved me.

01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:27.666
Considering where he'd been
until 4:00 a.m.,

01:19:28.541 --> 01:19:30.208
don't you find that sad?

01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.708
Well, where was he last night?

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:34.958
Where's Jackie?

01:19:37.666 --> 01:19:39.125
Inside her own circle.

01:19:40.291 --> 01:19:45.416
Well, I don't have many people
with devices finding things out,

01:19:45.916 --> 01:19:48.499
but I do know that you and I

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.124
belong to a very, very small
group of lucky angels

01:19:51.125 --> 01:19:53.666
who can go anywhere we want in this world.

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.583
But we can never, ever get away.

01:20:01.041 --> 01:20:02.708
Doesn't make us friends though.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.541
Where to now?

01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:22.250
We are tired, madam.

01:20:22.791 --> 01:20:24.000
I'm not tired.

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:26.833
We are tired.

01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:30.666
And we are worried.

01:20:50.416 --> 01:20:51.625
What is he doing here?

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.625
I invited him.

01:20:54.166 --> 01:20:55.124
I left a key.

01:20:55.125 --> 01:20:57.165
I have news that can't wait.

01:20:57.166 --> 01:20:58.083
No.

01:21:00.125 --> 01:21:02.708
Bruna and I will... we'll take the dogs out.

01:21:03.666 --> 01:21:05.582
Yes. Yes, we will.

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:06.958
And then we will return.

01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:11.207
Apparently, tonight we had
a little bit of a party, Doctor.

01:21:11.208 --> 01:21:13.708
Oh. The gravity of it all.

01:21:14.375 --> 01:21:15.208
Hm?

01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:18.458
People always disappoint me.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:20.250
Always.

01:21:23.208 --> 01:21:25.083
I had a wonderful evening.

01:21:25.625 --> 01:21:26.708
Madame Callas.

01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:33.207
Do you know opera?

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:34.375
Of course.

01:21:36.708 --> 01:21:37.875
In <i>La Traviata,</i>

01:21:39.708 --> 01:21:42.250
Violetta is diagnosed with tuberculosis.

01:21:43.125 --> 01:21:45.291
It is not tuberculosis.

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:48.666
It is not anything with one name.

01:21:49.583 --> 01:21:51.708
Your blood tells a story.

01:21:52.291 --> 01:21:54.041
An autobiography written in blood.

01:21:55.583 --> 01:21:58.625
As well as,
uh, the Mandrax,

01:21:59.291 --> 01:22:01.666
the various sedatives and stimulants,

01:22:02.416 --> 01:22:05.582
you are taking the steroid Prednisone?

01:22:05.583 --> 01:22:08.916
To combat my body's attempt
to turn me into a frog.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:14.833
And now your liver is beginning to fail.

01:22:16.166 --> 01:22:19.375
It is no longer taking out all the trash.

01:22:21.458 --> 01:22:25.208
- Your heart is failing too.
-  My poor heart.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:29.000
Your system is very frail.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:46.207
Your wonderful Ferruccio tells me

01:22:46.208 --> 01:22:49.208
you are planning to try again to sing.

01:22:49.791 --> 01:22:53.500
My wonderful Ferruccio
is very free with all my secrets.

01:22:55.625 --> 01:22:56.916
In my opinion,

01:22:58.333 --> 01:23:00.916
the extra stress
it will cause to your body,

01:23:01.416 --> 01:23:06.125
the medications you will probably need
to get through each day,

01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:08.208
they will kill you...

01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:13.874
if you keep pushing yourself to sing.

01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:18.374
And I say that as someone

01:23:18.375 --> 01:23:21.166
who would dearly love
to see you perform again.

01:23:21.750 --> 01:23:24.458
Well, you see,
I have no intention of performing again.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:27.208
Not for you or anyone else.

01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:30.041
So...

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:33.166
Then why are you rehearsing?

01:23:35.541 --> 01:23:37.833
My mother made me sing.

01:23:38.583 --> 01:23:41.000
Onassis forbade me to sing.

01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:45.416
And now, I will sing for myself.

01:23:47.666 --> 01:23:49.665
Well, your...

01:23:49.666 --> 01:23:50.915
...your beautiful life--

01:23:50.916 --> 01:23:52.625
Played before my eyes.

01:23:53.958 --> 01:23:55.291
Meaning what?

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.416
Meaning now, finally,

01:23:58.916 --> 01:24:01.916
I am in control of the end.

01:24:03.708 --> 01:24:04.958
I'm begging you

01:24:05.833 --> 01:24:06.958
to see reason.

01:24:08.708 --> 01:24:11.000
My life is opera.

01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:15.000
There is no reason in opera.

01:24:16.208 --> 01:24:18.625
Your voice will not return.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:22.041
Your voice is in heaven,

01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:24.875
and on a million records.

01:24:30.208 --> 01:24:31.166
Get out.

01:25:27.875 --> 01:25:31.583
It took a great deal of effort
for me to come into this restaurant.

01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:33.875
I had to say a magic spell.

01:25:35.541 --> 01:25:37.625
Since I sent you the medication,

01:25:39.291 --> 01:25:40.749
I keep regretting it.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:42.000
I have no regrets.

01:25:42.666 --> 01:25:43.666
How do I look?

01:25:44.333 --> 01:25:45.958
- Too thin.
- Mm.

01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:49.458
Well, a lot of me has been taken away.

01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:52.166
- Maria?
- Hmm?

01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:56.291
I've come to Paris.
I love Paris. I am happy.

01:25:58.125 --> 01:25:59.791
My life is

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:02.750
floating on like a tight ship.

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.958
I don't want to be sunk.

01:26:07.083 --> 01:26:09.665
In your message, you said you "needed" me.

01:26:09.666 --> 01:26:11.166
You needed to see me.

01:26:12.375 --> 01:26:15.125
I'm not gonna give you
any more medication. I'm not.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.750
I don't need any more medication.
It served its purpose.

01:26:20.666 --> 01:26:21.583
Thank you.

01:26:22.458 --> 01:26:24.583
I suggested this restaurant

01:26:25.291 --> 01:26:27.125
because it reminds me of her.

01:26:27.833 --> 01:26:28.833
Of who?

01:26:29.416 --> 01:26:31.125
The last time I saw Mama,

01:26:31.625 --> 01:26:32.791
she asked me for money.

01:26:33.875 --> 01:26:36.999
And she said,
"I brought you into this world

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:38.833
so you could take care of me."

01:26:39.750 --> 01:26:42.540
Then she said I was fat and unlovable.

01:26:42.541 --> 01:26:43.957
Wonderful memories.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:45.833
The time has passed, Maria.

01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:48.125
You close the door.

01:26:49.541 --> 01:26:50.375
Hmm.

01:26:51.916 --> 01:26:53.750
I will end this with the beginning.

01:26:57.666 --> 01:26:58.625
A toast.

01:26:59.208 --> 01:27:02.165
To memories shared only by you and I.

01:27:04.458 --> 01:27:05.458
Close the door.

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:10.166
German soldiers won't leave me alone.

01:27:16.791 --> 01:27:17.958
Sometimes,

01:27:19.291 --> 01:27:20.583
when you were crying,

01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.666
I took your place so you could rest.

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:28.291
Remember?

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:36.750
I live my life looking like this.

01:27:38.541 --> 01:27:40.708
And I live my life looking back,

01:27:41.541 --> 01:27:43.083
writing an autobiography.

01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:48.082
Look, if you're going to write
your autobiography,

01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:50.416
you will have to do it without my help.

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:54.000
It's already writing itself
before my eyes.

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:58.083
I don't even know if you're real.

01:28:01.708 --> 01:28:02.624
Okay.

01:28:06.708 --> 01:28:08.083
Ay! Stop.

01:28:08.916 --> 01:28:10.374
Maria, stop.

01:28:10.375 --> 01:28:11.958
That hurts, Maria.

01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:13.750
Stop.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:18.791
- I'm hallucinating.
- You're hallucinating?

01:28:19.666 --> 01:28:21.083
Then see a doctor.

01:28:23.791 --> 01:28:24.915
You are a doll.

01:28:24.916 --> 01:28:27.958
I have seen a doctor.

01:28:28.625 --> 01:28:29.541
Enough.

01:28:30.333 --> 01:28:32.290
You have your driver waiting for you.

01:28:32.291 --> 01:28:34.291
I don't have no debt to pay to you.

01:28:37.083 --> 01:28:38.124
My advice?

01:28:38.125 --> 01:28:40.500
Do not write anything about your life.

01:28:42.541 --> 01:28:43.708
But if you do,

01:28:44.666 --> 01:28:45.875
be kind to yourself.

01:28:47.666 --> 01:28:48.583
Because

01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.208
I was there in Athens with you,

01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:53.208
and I know that

01:28:54.916 --> 01:28:58.082
whatever your faults, whatever...

01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.500
...wrong you did, whatever...

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:04.208
...it's...

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:10.041
...you're not to blame, baby.

01:29:11.166 --> 01:29:12.916
You're really not to blame.

01:29:19.708 --> 01:29:20.708
Thank you.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:33.166
Sometimes I think it was all in my head.

01:29:34.708 --> 01:29:36.875
Close the door, little sister.

01:29:37.958 --> 01:29:39.041
I can't.

01:29:39.583 --> 01:29:42.082
It's the only way the music gets in.

01:29:42.083 --> 01:29:43.666
Fuck the music!

01:29:45.208 --> 01:29:47.458
Baby, you... you're 53 years old.

01:29:48.250 --> 01:29:51.541
You've never been free.
Forget the music and live.

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:17.875
My God.

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:19.708
You're on time.

01:30:20.666 --> 01:30:23.625
My audience awaits, full of hate.

01:30:24.208 --> 01:30:25.291
What hate?

01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:29.958
I'm going to sing the mad scene
from <i>Anna Bolena.</i>

01:30:32.208 --> 01:30:34.000
I performed it at La Scala.

01:30:34.583 --> 01:30:37.750
- 1957.
- Yes, the people of Milan hated me.

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:42.125
I had canceled. I was sick.
They never forgave me.

01:30:42.708 --> 01:30:46.332
And I spilt my venom
across the poor innocents.

01:30:46.333 --> 01:30:48.458
- But then you sang.
-  Then I sang.

01:30:49.083 --> 01:30:50.208
Full of fury.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:52.082
At the press.

01:30:52.083 --> 01:30:53.540
Fury at the judgment,

01:30:53.541 --> 01:30:56.041
my mother, the world...

01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:00.166
Bruna, now.

01:31:00.833 --> 01:31:01.666
Begin.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.833
Light, please.

Brava! Brava!

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:55.791
Madam?

01:33:57.291 --> 01:33:58.666
You were magnificent.

01:34:05.791 --> 01:34:07.333
Oh God.

01:34:15.125 --> 01:34:16.166
Let's go home.

01:34:17.166 --> 01:34:18.375
Love is at home.

01:34:26.416 --> 01:34:30.915
Madame Callas, I write a music column
for <i>Le Figaro</i> newspaper,

01:34:30.916 --> 01:34:33.957
and, for reasons connected
to the duty of journalists,

01:34:33.958 --> 01:34:35.624
I was in the theater just now.

01:34:35.625 --> 01:34:38.374
I heard you perform
the mad scene from <i>Anna Bolena,</i>

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:40.666
and it was pretty not great.

01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:44.290
It was pretty terrible, in fact.

01:34:44.291 --> 01:34:46.790
There are rumors
you plan to make a comeback.

01:34:46.791 --> 01:34:49.707
Would you care to give me
a comment on your progress,

01:34:49.708 --> 01:34:52.124
bearing in mind
what I just heard and recorded?

01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:54.832
- Why the fuck would you print this?
-  She's Maria Callas.

01:34:54.833 --> 01:34:56.040
She is--

01:34:56.041 --> 01:34:57.540
Hey, people want to know.

01:34:57.541 --> 01:35:00.332
- Please, please.
-  Go ahead, Madame Callas!

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:03.249
You al-- You always had a reputation
for having a terrible temper.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:05.708
These photos will sell
the story all over the world.

01:35:06.458 --> 01:35:10.124
Madame Callas, why don't you calm down
and give me your side of the story?

01:35:10.125 --> 01:35:12.624
Our readers are very interested--

01:35:13.541 --> 01:35:15.790
You have to leave us alone.

01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:17.290
No!

01:35:17.291 --> 01:35:19.625
- You have to leave us alone.
-  No!

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:30.375
Our readers want to know
what the hell happened to you.

01:35:31.458 --> 01:35:33.291
What a tragedy, eh?

01:35:39.458 --> 01:35:41.625
I cleaned the car
as you instructed, madam.

01:35:43.125 --> 01:35:44.875
And I am ready to take you home.

01:36:03.625 --> 01:36:04.625
Play it.

01:36:07.583 --> 01:36:08.583
Madam, please.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:10.916

I'm guessing
this film of yours is almost over.

01:37:22.708 --> 01:37:24.958
Have I told you
I've fallen in love with you?

01:37:29.083 --> 01:37:30.625
That happens a lot.

01:37:35.916 --> 01:37:37.333
Before the final scene,

01:37:38.250 --> 01:37:40.250
there is something I want you to know.

01:37:42.791 --> 01:37:43.916
Record, please.

01:37:45.041 --> 01:37:46.500
I have no equipment.

01:37:48.333 --> 01:37:49.833
Then remember this.

01:37:52.125 --> 01:37:53.750
Because no one else will know.

01:37:55.708 --> 01:37:57.000
When he was dying,

01:37:57.916 --> 01:37:59.333
<i>here, in Paris,</i>

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:01.166
<i>I went to him.</i>

01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:36.041
I love you.

01:38:38.541 --> 01:38:39.625
Is that it?

01:38:40.125 --> 01:38:41.250
Should I go now?

01:38:48.625 --> 01:38:50.790
I have some things to say.

01:38:50.791 --> 01:38:51.749
Hmm.

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:53.207
Number one...

01:38:53.208 --> 01:38:54.125
Hmm?

01:38:54.916 --> 01:38:56.415
...I still hate opera.

01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:01.875
You don't have to say so much.

01:39:02.625 --> 01:39:04.124
I know most things.

01:39:04.125 --> 01:39:07.332
- Oh? You know most things?
- Mm-hmm.

01:39:07.333 --> 01:39:08.333
Okay.

01:39:09.125 --> 01:39:11.583
- You never lacked confidence.
- Mm.

01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.625
Are you happy?

01:39:17.708 --> 01:39:18.708
Well,

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:20.999
I found out in the newspaper

01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.374
that Frank Sinatra
makes ten times more than I earn.

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:25.541
Oh.

01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:28.665
- You are poor.
- Always.

01:39:33.541 --> 01:39:36.333
I wish you could sing
right here, right now.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.082
I'd wake the whole of Paris.

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:43.708
Oh, they'd forgive you.

01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:49.750
You know,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.166
I think I'll go to Athens.

01:39:54.833 --> 01:39:58.832
My spirit will find a chair on the harbor

01:39:58.833 --> 01:40:00.666
and watch the ships.

01:40:04.250 --> 01:40:06.083
And who will you be waiting for?

01:40:09.208 --> 01:40:11.250
I thought you knew most things.

01:40:16.875 --> 01:40:18.083
You know, I...

01:40:18.625 --> 01:40:20.958
I found out you married her
in the newspaper.

01:40:24.791 --> 01:40:28.541
Sometimes you get married
because you have a free day.

01:40:29.666 --> 01:40:31.458
Well...

01:40:32.833 --> 01:40:36.458
The morning I found out, I checked,
and my heart was not broken.

01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:40.666
You hurt my pride though.

01:40:42.166 --> 01:40:45.208
Well, I guess that's something, right?

01:40:48.541 --> 01:40:49.875
When it's your turn,

01:40:51.791 --> 01:40:53.583
will you come to Athens to see me?

01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:57.333
Well, I'm sure I have business there.

01:40:59.416 --> 01:41:00.291
Yes.

01:41:02.625 --> 01:41:04.166
So I'll make sure

01:41:04.916 --> 01:41:06.791
I have two canvas chairs.

01:41:13.666 --> 01:41:14.500
Yes.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:18.374
I should never have tried
to stop you singing.

01:41:18.375 --> 01:41:19.541
That is correct.

01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.666
I always loved you.

01:41:23.791 --> 01:41:25.666
That is also correct.

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:31.332
Mr. Onassis, your wife is here.

01:41:39.666 --> 01:41:41.416
Athens, Maria.

01:41:42.458 --> 01:41:45.500
You and me... only.

01:41:50.541 --> 01:41:51.875
<i>And how was he?</i>

01:41:53.250 --> 01:41:54.250
We are Greek.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.665
Death is our familiar companion.

01:41:57.666 --> 01:41:59.166
Why did you visit him?

01:41:59.916 --> 01:42:01.541
Because he asked me to.

01:42:03.583 --> 01:42:05.125
Did you see Jackie?

01:42:07.458 --> 01:42:09.333
I went out the back door.

01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:13.375
Even in death, I was the secret.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.000
Yes, but he wanted <i>you</i>.

01:42:17.916 --> 01:42:19.250
Jackie was his wife.

01:42:20.541 --> 01:42:21.541
But you...

01:42:22.625 --> 01:42:23.958
you were his life.

01:43:58.958 --> 01:44:00.957
- Eight.
- Nine.

01:44:05.375 --> 01:44:07.040
You always win.

01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:08.624
- She cheats.
- No!

01:44:08.625 --> 01:44:10.124
- Yes, you do.
- No, no, no.

01:44:10.125 --> 01:44:12.374
- Yes, you do.
- Oh, Bruna, we know. We know.

01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:16.249
She is the sphinx, that one.

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:18.040
- Yes.
-  No.

01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:19.999
- Yeah, you pretend to be...
- "I'm so..."

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:21.874
- What's the score? You're winning.
- Dangerous.

01:44:21.875 --> 01:44:23.333
No, no. Maria is winning.

01:44:24.041 --> 01:44:26.082
- Yeah, one.
- Yeah, one more than...

01:44:26.083 --> 01:44:28.624
- I'm losing.
- I hope you always stay together.

01:44:28.625 --> 01:44:30.833
- What?
- I hope you always stay together.

01:44:31.500 --> 01:44:34.500
When I'm gone.
I hope you always stay together.

01:44:38.125 --> 01:44:40.458
You're very good together.
Good people.

01:44:44.458 --> 01:44:46.832
If she keeps winning,
it's gonna be difficult.

01:44:46.833 --> 01:44:50.500
I don't know if I'm gonna be... staying.

01:45:04.041 --> 01:45:06.499
<i>Wait, wait.</i>

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.583
Wait, wait, wait.

01:45:29.625 --> 01:45:32.582
Madam?
We have moved the piano again.

01:45:32.583 --> 01:45:33.666
Come and see.

01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:43.208
Madam, it is gone midday.

01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:44.916
Are you okay?

01:45:52.583 --> 01:45:54.291
Madam, please.

01:45:58.916 --> 01:46:02.208
Er, we will buy all of your favorite food...

01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:05.040
Oysters and salt beef

01:46:05.041 --> 01:46:07.083
and... and those silly chocolates.

01:46:07.875 --> 01:46:11.915
Tonight, we will sit down together,
and, uh... and we will eat.

01:46:11.916 --> 01:46:13.666
-  Leave me alone.
- Madam?

01:46:20.375 --> 01:46:23.082
So, we are
going to the grocery, madam,

01:46:23.083 --> 01:46:26.749
to take what we need
and, uh, we will be back soon.
