02:27.540 --> 02:30.340
Bueno.
Family is everything.

02:30.440 --> 02:32.240
No?

02:32.340 --> 02:35.740
Now, do you love your son?

02:36.710 --> 02:40.480
S?

02:47.360 --> 02:51.950
Now... do you understand?

02:52.060 --> 02:56.430
You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.060
Georgina!

05:08.160 --> 05:11.430
Obey me, I will love you.
Come on.

05:11.530 --> 05:13.300
That's how it works, huh?

05:13.400 --> 05:16.570
- Simple
- That's right.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.570
Mwah.

05:22.710 --> 05:26.010
She got a sister?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.310
How's business?

05:29.420 --> 05:32.320
The Japanese are here in a big way.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.250
Cheap labor, factory space.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.320
But they feel a lot safer living
over the border in El Paso.

05:40.430 --> 05:43.490
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.500
- Ah.
- Come on.

05:49.970 --> 05:53.200
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

05:56.950 --> 06:00.110
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.280
Nah. Been movin' around,
you know.

06:02.390 --> 06:06.450
Colombia, couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.290
Oh.

06:11.390 --> 06:13.950
You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?

06:14.060 --> 06:16.620
- No.
- You don't?

06:16.730 --> 06:20.900
Me either.

06:21.000 --> 06:25.810
- How long you staying?
- I don't know. I just... you know.

06:25.910 --> 06:29.870
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

06:29.980 --> 06:32.500
You know, I came by on impulse.

06:32.620 --> 06:36.180
Well, I could do with some impulse.

06:46.300 --> 06:49.320
What happened?

06:49.430 --> 06:51.630
Family paid the ransom...

06:51.730 --> 06:55.730
then they sent the kid home
after a couple of days...

06:55.840 --> 06:58.000
minus an ear, of course.

06:58.110 --> 07:01.740
Now every mother in Mexico City
with a little bit of money wants
bigger and better bodyguards...

07:01.840 --> 07:03.810
my own wife included.

07:03.910 --> 07:07.210
I hate to break it to you,
but she's right. She's right.

07:08.920 --> 07:13.180
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh,
kidnap and ransom insurance.

07:13.290 --> 07:16.520
I have a policy. A.I.G.
My dad gave it to me.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.890
Yeah, I know.
I got it for your dad.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.930
<i>But what are you gonna do in 60 days</i>
<i>when you can't renew it?</i>

07:23.030 --> 07:27.300
- You can't because
you don't have a bodyguard.
- I had to let Emilio go.

07:27.400 --> 07:31.030
You gotta please Lisa.
I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.740
Look, a bodyguard's
like anything else.

07:37.850 --> 07:41.110
You get what you pay for, okay?

07:41.220 --> 07:44.210
You could do this.
You get one that's got a decent r閟um?

07:44.320 --> 07:46.650
We're not looking for
goddamn Superman here, right?

07:46.760 --> 07:49.490
Get someone cheap
till you renew the policy...

07:49.590 --> 07:52.960
and then, uh...
then fire the prick for whatever.

07:53.060 --> 07:55.120
Incompetence.

07:55.230 --> 07:59.630
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school...

07:59.740 --> 08:02.710
and that your wife gets to save face.

08:02.810 --> 08:07.610
This way, you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighborhood.

08:20.220 --> 08:23.420
That's right. A bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.

08:23.530 --> 08:26.930
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

08:27.030 --> 08:29.500
In my state,
I couldn't guard a corpse.

08:29.600 --> 08:32.400
It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show

08:32.500 --> 08:37.630
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Yeah? You think they'd hire
a drunk, a has-been?

08:39.310 --> 08:42.610
You have to keep it under control.

08:42.710 --> 08:47.480
What if there was, you know, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

08:47.580 --> 08:51.610
You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.

08:51.720 --> 08:54.320
- I don't know.
- It's not exactly a scam, Crease.

08:54.420 --> 08:58.660
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
- Yeah.

08:58.760 --> 09:00.960
Bodyguard's gotta be close
to people though.

09:01.060 --> 09:03.900
He gotta talk all the time,
and I'm no good at that.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.530
You'll be the silent type.
People are gonna appreciate that.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.340
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

09:17.450 --> 09:20.350
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

09:20.450 --> 09:23.250
He owns one of the plants in Ju醨ez.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.290
Yeah?

09:25.390 --> 09:28.190
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

09:28.290 --> 09:31.230
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

09:31.330 --> 09:35.200
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

09:35.300 --> 09:37.820
He asked me if I knew
anybody he could trust.

09:39.400 --> 09:42.390
- And you thought of me.
- Yeah.

09:42.510 --> 09:45.910
Take a job, Crease.
Breathe some air.

09:46.010 --> 09:48.370
Then decide if you want
to stick around or not.

09:48.480 --> 09:52.570
Besides, I'm glad to see you.
I got nobody to talk to down here.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.960
Listen, my wife wants someone
presentable and polite.

10:05.330 --> 10:08.860
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.690
Your r閟um?s quite impressive.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.260
Sixteen years of military experience
extensive counterterrorism work.

10:15.370 --> 10:18.930
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

10:19.040 --> 10:21.310
I drink.

10:21.410 --> 10:23.400
How does that affect you?

10:23.510 --> 10:25.980
Well...

10:26.080 --> 10:28.210
coordination, reaction time.

10:28.320 --> 10:32.080
If top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can...

10:32.190 --> 10:35.210
but the service will be
on par with the pay.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.380
What if amateurs tried?

10:38.490 --> 10:41.620
I'd probably kill 'em.
Is that likely?

10:41.730 --> 10:43.700
No.

10:43.800 --> 10:46.560
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

11:13.460 --> 11:16.230
Lisa!

11:18.430 --> 11:20.330
Lisa!

11:31.550 --> 11:34.450
My wife, Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

11:41.490 --> 11:43.720
- You're an American.
- So are you.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.560
It's all in there.

11:50.600 --> 11:52.530
Would you like a drink?

11:52.640 --> 11:55.370
Yes, uh, Jack and water'd be good.

11:56.940 --> 12:00.470
- Have you done much
of this kind of work before?
- No, ma'am.

12:00.580 --> 12:04.340
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

12:06.850 --> 12:09.550
- You have a family, Mr. Creasy?
- No.

12:09.650 --> 12:11.850
Pita.

12:11.950 --> 12:13.920
Pita.

12:15.260 --> 12:17.350
- Thank you.
- Yes, Mom?

12:17.460 --> 12:19.360
Honey, this is, uh, Mr. Creasy.

12:24.530 --> 12:27.000
In English, honey.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.730
Um, do you wanna show
Mr. Creasy to his room?

12:29.840 --> 12:33.540
- This way, Mr. Creasy.
- Okay.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.950
Thank you.

12:50.890 --> 12:53.690
Just like that?

12:53.800 --> 12:56.200
I think it's nice...

12:56.300 --> 12:58.770
that he's an American.

12:58.870 --> 13:03.070
I think it's terrific. You sure?

13:05.740 --> 13:08.040
Thank you.

13:08.140 --> 13:10.770
Thank you.

13:10.880 --> 13:13.350
I feel better now.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.150
ola, Bruno!
uenas tardes!

13:18.250 --> 13:20.550
That's Bruno, the gardener.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.720
And, um, that's Maria, the cook.

13:22.830 --> 13:25.620
ola, Maria!
Hola, Pita.

13:27.900 --> 13:31.920
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

13:35.100 --> 13:38.940
You've got a TV and C.D. Player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?

13:39.040 --> 13:41.410
I don't know.

13:41.510 --> 13:44.000
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

13:44.110 --> 13:47.280
That's Bird.

13:47.380 --> 13:50.250
Emilio forgot to take him
when he left.

13:51.420 --> 13:53.750
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

13:55.760 --> 13:59.990
Have you protected a lot of children
before, Mr. Creasy?

14:00.100 --> 14:02.860
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

14:02.970 --> 14:04.870
Creasy.

14:04.970 --> 14:06.900
Bye, Creasy.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.660
So long.

14:10.770 --> 14:12.500
Bye, Bird.

14:17.180 --> 14:19.510
Ow.

14:22.490 --> 14:25.980
- School tomorrow, peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

14:27.390 --> 14:29.860
Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.650
Yeah, we'll see.

14:31.760 --> 14:35.560
If you get a dog,
will you give up your bear?

14:35.660 --> 14:39.000
You're getting too old for him.

14:39.100 --> 14:42.500
- How'd you like Mr. Creasy?
- Creasy.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.970
He said to call him just Creasy.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.540
- Uh-huh.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.940
No, not if he asked you.

14:50.050 --> 14:52.880
Here. There you go.

15:00.720 --> 15:04.520
- He's like a bear too.
- Yeah?

15:04.630 --> 15:06.930
A big, sad bear.

15:08.560 --> 15:12.190
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

15:16.010 --> 15:17.910
- Good night, honey.
- Night.

15:21.340 --> 15:24.610
- Oh, can you get me
some floss in the morning?
- Floss?

15:24.710 --> 15:28.240
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.
- Oh, sure.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.610
Good night, Bear.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.690
Creasy Bear.

16:09.230 --> 16:11.560
What's that one for?

16:11.660 --> 16:13.560
La Virgin de Guadalupe.

16:13.660 --> 16:18.070
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

16:18.170 --> 16:20.800
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one.

16:20.900 --> 16:23.460
I don't know.

16:23.570 --> 16:26.510
She likes him.

16:28.210 --> 16:31.410
- What are you talking about?
- Creasy.

16:32.950 --> 16:35.610
Pita likes him.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.620
Pita loves school.

16:37.720 --> 16:42.920
Pita would love Count Dracula
if he took her back there, honey.

16:43.030 --> 16:44.990
Okay?

16:47.460 --> 16:50.330
- Hey. Are you okay?
I don't know.

16:50.430 --> 16:54.530
Okay?

16:54.640 --> 16:57.070
I don't know, Lisa.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.140
I'm trying.

17:54.330 --> 17:56.300
Come on, Bird.

17:56.400 --> 17:59.770
That's right.
That's right. Come on.

17:59.870 --> 18:03.030
All right. Home to Emilio.

18:03.140 --> 18:06.010
You're home free, baby.

18:26.130 --> 18:28.890
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The U.S.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.930
- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.

18:32.030 --> 18:34.030
You can drive and talk
at the same time.

18:34.140 --> 18:36.600
No, I can't, Pita, so, please,
let me just do my job.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.780
Are you going to stay?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.780
My last bodyguard left.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.750
Somebody gave him
more money than we could.

18:47.850 --> 18:51.810
I guess that makes me
a bargain then, huh?

18:51.920 --> 18:56.320
Being black... is that a positive or negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

18:56.430 --> 18:58.330
Time will tell.

19:01.860 --> 19:06.100
There were 24 kidnappings
in Mexico City in the last six days.

19:06.200 --> 19:08.100
- Four a day.
- Yeah?

19:08.200 --> 19:10.670
- Twenty-four?
- Twenty-four. What do you
think about that, Creasy?

19:10.770 --> 19:14.440
- I think that you know
entirely more than you should.
- Well, thank you.

19:37.570 --> 19:40.190
Hola, Miguel.

19:42.740 --> 19:44.600
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

19:44.710 --> 19:49.010
- What?
- You have to sign in, show them your I.D.

19:49.110 --> 19:52.550
Buenos d韆s. Come on.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.620
Right there.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.350
- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.

20:09.130 --> 20:11.030
ola, Pita!
-

20:11.130 --> 20:15.330
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.340
Sister Anna, this is
my new bodyguard, Creasy.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.570
Sister Anna, the headmistress.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.700
Se駉r Creasy.

20:23.810 --> 20:25.710
Hurry. Class is about to begin.

20:25.810 --> 20:28.150
- Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.740
- Madre.
- You must look after our Pita.

20:30.850 --> 20:33.050
It is not good that she's late today.

20:33.160 --> 20:37.720
I'm very sorry. I, uh... I'll have to get
used to the rules. It won't happen again.

20:37.830 --> 20:41.390
No offense, but I regret
that your profession needs to exist.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.630
So do I, Madre. So do I.

20:44.730 --> 20:48.690
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

20:50.310 --> 20:52.430
No, not for a long time.

20:52.540 --> 20:55.910
The Bible says,
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome..."

20:56.010 --> 20:59.450
"Overcome evil with good."

21:05.590 --> 21:08.390
I'm the sheep that got lost, Madre.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.850
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

22:16.430 --> 22:18.620
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

22:18.730 --> 22:22.630
No, I don't remember.
It, uh... Nah, I didn't like it.

22:22.730 --> 22:24.790
Why not?

22:24.900 --> 22:27.460
Because it wasn't a school like yours.

22:27.570 --> 22:29.540
There was no, uh... no Sister Anna.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.570
Were you unhappy?

22:36.780 --> 22:40.180
Being unhappy, Pita, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

22:49.630 --> 22:51.720
What happened to your hand?

22:53.260 --> 22:55.160
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

22:55.260 --> 22:59.530
Look, no more questions, okay?

22:59.640 --> 23:02.000
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.700
Look, I got a job to do. Hey!

23:04.810 --> 23:07.040
No. <i>Gracias. Gracias.No. No.</i>

23:07.140 --> 23:10.080
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you, okay?

23:10.180 --> 23:13.150
No, no, no. I'm being paid
to be your bodyguard.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.340
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>I'm not being paid to be your friend.</i>

23:16.450 --> 23:20.010
I'm being paid to protect you,
so no more questions. That's it. Period.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.520
- You hear me?
- Yes.

23:26.630 --> 23:30.060
- And no crying.
- I'm not crying.

23:30.170 --> 23:33.230
Well, don't start.

23:33.340 --> 23:35.770
You gotta understand, this is a job.

23:35.870 --> 23:38.670
In order for me to do...

23:38.770 --> 23:40.710
In order for... Wait a minute.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.330
Yeah, come in.

24:37.930 --> 24:40.090
Mr. Creasy.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.000
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

24:43.110 --> 24:45.070
I'm fine, thanks.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.510
Is the food all right?
'Cause, uh, Maria told me you didn't eat.

24:50.610 --> 24:54.070
Uh... yeah, the food is great.

24:54.180 --> 24:56.670
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

25:00.060 --> 25:02.650
So you, uh, read the Bible?

25:02.760 --> 25:06.390
Yeah, sometimes.

25:06.500 --> 25:10.260
- Does it help?
- Yeah, sometimes.

25:12.570 --> 25:15.870
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

25:17.710 --> 25:20.830
How are you doing with Pita?

25:20.940 --> 25:22.840
Fine. Fine.

25:22.940 --> 25:26.210
Soon as she figures out that I'm
not her new toy, we'll be fine.

25:26.310 --> 25:29.280
- Yeah, she told me about that.
- Okay.

25:29.380 --> 25:33.010
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.580
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

25:36.690 --> 25:41.030
- And Pita just wants to be friends.
<i>- Okay.</i>

25:41.130 --> 25:44.760
But you're paying me to protect her,
right? Not to be her friend.

25:44.870 --> 25:46.830
Right?

25:48.270 --> 25:51.540
So, uh...

25:51.640 --> 25:54.170
look, maybe this isn't
gonna work out.

25:54.280 --> 25:58.240
Maybe your husband should find
somebody who's a little more sociable.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.020
No, you're right.

26:05.550 --> 26:08.460
You're being paid to protect her...

26:08.560 --> 26:11.920
and I'm confident that you'll do that.

26:16.460 --> 26:19.830
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

26:50.700 --> 26:53.730
You think God
will forgive us for what we've done?

27:19.790 --> 27:22.130
I'm tired of killin', Ray.

27:26.570 --> 27:30.800
You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?

27:30.910 --> 27:34.400
In my state, I couldn't...
I couldn't guard a corpse.

27:34.510 --> 27:37.000
Talk all the time.

27:37.110 --> 27:39.100
You know, I'm no good at that.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.410
You know, I'm no good at that.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.850
You know how they say...

27:48.920 --> 27:51.320
a bullet always tells the truth?

28:32.430 --> 28:34.400
Yeah.

28:34.500 --> 28:36.660
- Hey.
- Crease.

28:36.770 --> 28:38.470
What's wrong?

28:38.570 --> 28:42.010
Hey, listen, you-you ever have a...

28:42.110 --> 28:44.580
a nine-millimeter round
that didn't go off?

28:44.680 --> 28:47.480
Well, yeah. Failure to fire.

28:47.580 --> 28:50.710
I know.
Failure to fire and-and-and, uh...

28:50.820 --> 28:53.690
You know, I pulled the trigger
and... and... and...

28:53.790 --> 28:55.690
click, nothing.

28:55.790 --> 28:58.090
You're talking about a bad primer.

28:58.190 --> 29:00.250
Yeah, I... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

29:00.360 --> 29:02.850
But I... You know, right, dimple.
Dimple on the primer.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.060
That may be.

29:05.170 --> 29:08.760
Well, like we used to say...

29:08.870 --> 29:12.740
a bullet always tells the truth.

29:18.050 --> 29:20.670
Crease?

29:20.780 --> 29:23.440
- You all right?
- Yeah.

29:24.790 --> 29:27.120
What were you shooting at?

29:27.220 --> 29:29.350
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry I woke you.

29:29.460 --> 29:33.920
No, i-it's okay. Nothin'.
I was watchin' TV.

29:34.030 --> 29:36.860
Okay.

29:38.030 --> 29:40.230
All right.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.640
Pita, you have a pencil?

31:04.150 --> 31:05.780
Thank you.

31:39.520 --> 31:42.180
It's hard to get used to
the traffic down here.

31:42.290 --> 31:44.380
Yeah. I'm very sorry.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.180
- See you, baby.
- All right. See you later.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.550
- Hey. Don't forget your towel.
- Oh, thank you.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.650
Bye.Buenas d韆s.

33:24.690 --> 33:27.590
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.870
Thanks.

33:38.770 --> 33:42.610
- So what do I do?
- What do you think you should do?

33:42.710 --> 33:44.770
You're the fastest one in the water,
the slowest one off the blocks.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.320
- What do you think that means?
What do you gotta do?
- Get faster off the blocks.

33:48.420 --> 33:50.650
Get faster off the blocks.

33:50.750 --> 33:54.120
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

33:54.220 --> 33:56.990
- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- Yeah, you'll be fine.

33:57.090 --> 33:59.060
You'll be okay.

34:01.060 --> 34:04.030
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

34:04.130 --> 34:06.730
I never finish better than third.

34:06.830 --> 34:09.700
All right.
Maybe you are slow then.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.250
Go!

34:38.500 --> 34:41.130
<i>How do you think he got out?</i>

34:42.900 --> 34:45.930
- I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right?

34:46.040 --> 34:47.910
It's better for him.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.570
Actually, he was driving me crazy.

34:56.120 --> 34:58.090
Good night.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.050
Good night.

35:20.580 --> 35:23.140
- See you in a couple of days. I love you.
- All right. Love you.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.140
Be good. Come on, Lise.

35:25.250 --> 35:28.740
- All right, sweetheart.
We'll call you from Detroit.
- Okay.

35:28.850 --> 35:31.790
- I love you.
- Love you.

35:31.890 --> 35:33.850
- Okay. Bye, honey.
- Se駉ra.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.050
- Bye.
- Oh. Gracias.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.630
- Okay. Bye, honey!
- Bye.

35:38.730 --> 35:41.020
- I love you.
- Love you.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.400
I hate leaving her.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.340
Concentratin'?

36:03.450 --> 36:05.680
Eyes are closed?

36:08.420 --> 36:10.390
What happened?

36:10.490 --> 36:13.020
- I flinched.
- You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

36:13.130 --> 36:14.920
- Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear.

36:15.030 --> 36:17.460
The gunshot holds no fear! Say it.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.530
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

36:19.630 --> 36:21.600
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

36:21.700 --> 36:22.810
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

36:22.850 --> 36:23.930
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

36:24.040 --> 36:26.030
You welcome the sound.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.440
In fact, it's the sound
that sets you free.

36:28.540 --> 36:31.480
You are a prisoner on this block
until that sound sets you free.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.950
- Are you ready? Are you ready?
- Yes. Yes.

36:34.050 --> 36:35.640
- Are you set?
- Uh-huh.

36:42.920 --> 36:44.890
- Creasy?
- Hmm?

36:44.990 --> 36:48.160
- What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask?

36:48.260 --> 36:50.660
It's in my history book.

36:50.770 --> 36:53.500
- Oh.
- It's like a wife, right?

36:53.600 --> 36:56.900
Yeah. Yes, uh... Can I see that?

36:57.000 --> 36:59.530
- Kind of a wife.
- Right there.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.770
But the emperor of China
had 1,000 of them.

37:02.880 --> 37:04.810
Um...

37:04.910 --> 37:09.010
Okay, like nowadays in-in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

37:09.120 --> 37:11.680
But in the olden time cultures,
they had, uh...

37:11.790 --> 37:15.380
you know, different...
uh, different rules.

37:17.260 --> 37:20.020
- Why, you feel sorry for the husband?
- Yeah.

37:20.130 --> 37:22.530
Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

37:25.030 --> 37:29.030
Creasy. You're smiling.

37:29.140 --> 37:31.730
- What?
- You were smiling.

37:31.840 --> 37:33.930
- No, I'm not. No, I was not.
- You were.

37:34.040 --> 37:36.440
- You're not now, but you were.
- You were smiling. I wasn't.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.340
- You were.
- When?

37:38.450 --> 37:40.940
- Like five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

37:41.050 --> 37:44.580
- A second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

37:44.690 --> 37:46.880
- Six seconds ago I wasn't smiling.
- Ten seconds ago.

37:46.990 --> 37:50.620
Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in
the next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.390
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- Mmm!

37:58.500 --> 38:00.970
- No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
- Yeah, you...

38:01.070 --> 38:03.300
That's not a smile.
A smirk is different.

38:03.400 --> 38:07.270
They both start with "S," but they're
not the same... Do your homework.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.340
You were.

38:12.510 --> 38:15.450
Bang!

38:15.550 --> 38:17.980
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.920
Bang!

38:21.020 --> 38:24.890
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop. Come here.

38:24.990 --> 38:27.320
Hurry up, hurry up. Set.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.160
Bang!

38:29.260 --> 38:32.390
Bang!

38:33.940 --> 38:36.900
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

38:38.410 --> 38:41.770
You listen for the sound.
You don't anticipate.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.470
- Concentrate on the sound.
You understand me?

38:44.580 --> 38:46.950
They're gaining on you!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Stop! Stop!

38:47.050 --> 38:50.180
Come on, get out.
Let's go again. Let's go again.

39:08.070 --> 39:11.040
- Gracias. Come here, girl!
- Daddy!

39:11.140 --> 39:13.940
Oh, I missed you so much.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.700
- I missed you too.
- How are you doing? I got a surprise for you.

39:16.810 --> 39:19.010
- You do?
- Ready?

39:19.110 --> 39:21.600
- Huh?
- You got me a dog! You finally got me a dog!

39:21.720 --> 39:25.210
- Huh?
- You bought me a dog, finally! Oh, my God!

39:25.320 --> 39:27.450
- What do you think?
- Oh, my gosh.

39:27.560 --> 39:30.520
- Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam, like Dad.

39:30.630 --> 39:33.460
Great! Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!

39:33.560 --> 39:35.530
- State.
- Mm-hmm.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.960
Bhutan.
It's a Himalayan kingdom.

39:41.070 --> 39:44.560
<i>They were having some problems</i>
<i>with their royal family not that long ago.</i>

39:44.670 --> 39:47.400
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.710
Any more questions?

39:50.810 --> 39:52.710
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- What?

39:52.810 --> 39:54.800
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.180
What kind of question is that?
You're supposed to be studying history.

39:57.280 --> 40:00.740
- That is history. Creasy history.
- No, that's ancient history.

40:00.860 --> 40:02.480
- No more questions.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?

40:02.590 --> 40:05.580
Nonya. Nonya business.
That's who.

40:05.690 --> 40:09.930
- Okay?
- Hi.

40:10.030 --> 40:13.730
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

40:13.830 --> 40:16.560
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

40:16.670 --> 40:20.230
Well, um, I'll leave you two
to your history.

40:21.840 --> 40:24.610
- Good night.
- Good night, honey.

40:27.180 --> 40:29.740
- Okay, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

40:36.120 --> 40:39.180
Go, Pita, go. Go! Go, go, go, go!

40:41.360 --> 40:43.850
Go, go, go, go, go.

40:43.960 --> 40:46.260
-

40:47.570 --> 40:49.760
- 10.99.
- Yes!

40:49.870 --> 40:52.300
Whoo!

40:52.410 --> 40:55.640
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.110
There's trained,
then there's untrained.

40:58.210 --> 40:59.910
- Now, which are you?
- Trained.

41:00.010 --> 41:02.210
Trained. Okay. Let's go again.

41:10.160 --> 41:12.790
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

41:12.890 --> 41:14.830
Okay. Hey.

41:14.930 --> 41:18.130
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

41:18.230 --> 41:20.630
- Don't smile, don't fool around
if you want to win.
- Okay.

41:20.740 --> 41:22.730
- You want to win? Trained or untrained?
- Trained.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.140
Go.

41:25.240 --> 41:29.680
- Se駉r Creasy,nice to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Madre.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.680
Pita's parents are away
on business in Ju醨ez. I was...

41:32.780 --> 41:35.410
Today you are her father.

42:57.930 --> 43:00.490
Pita Ramos!

43:06.240 --> 43:09.640
I won! Creasy! I won!

43:09.740 --> 43:13.340
- Okay.
- I won!

43:22.390 --> 43:26.720
- Once upon a time, when <i>we</i> were young...
- When I was young.

43:26.830 --> 43:29.920
Well, when we were young
and he was younger...

43:30.030 --> 43:32.760
all heads turned our way.

43:32.870 --> 43:35.530
We made a deal
to take the world together.

43:35.640 --> 43:39.470
Yeah, then one day
I got a call, and he said...

43:39.570 --> 43:42.870
"I'm in love! I'm in love!

43:42.980 --> 43:45.740
And I'm moving to Mexico. "

43:45.850 --> 43:48.210
And... I said...

43:48.320 --> 43:51.980
- "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

43:52.090 --> 43:54.180
I said, "The plan's right here."

43:54.290 --> 43:56.760
Yeah. Yeah. And what'd I do?

43:56.860 --> 43:59.260
I hung up, then I met Alicia...

43:59.360 --> 44:03.560
and then I went,
"Oh, now I got you! I got you."

44:03.660 --> 44:06.390
I got it. Can I kiss her? Is that...

44:06.500 --> 44:10.130
Absolutely!
Hey, what are you doing?

44:15.840 --> 44:20.470
- You got me.
- Okay, I think now is a good a time as any.

44:23.380 --> 44:26.080
I bought it with my own money.

44:31.790 --> 44:33.820
Open it.

44:38.200 --> 44:42.660
It's St. Jude,
patron saint of lost causes.

44:42.770 --> 44:44.600
Wow.

44:46.540 --> 44:48.470
Well deserved.

44:52.710 --> 44:55.310
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

44:56.950 --> 44:58.850
You're welcome.

45:47.530 --> 45:50.260
- Dad.
- Yes, sweetie?

45:50.370 --> 45:52.270
Can I talk to you?

45:52.370 --> 45:54.500
Yes.

45:54.610 --> 45:57.840
I don't want to play piano.
I want to swim.

45:57.950 --> 46:00.380
It's not open for discussion,
honey, okay?

46:00.480 --> 46:04.350
Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher,
and if he accepts you as his student...

46:04.450 --> 46:06.420
you're gonna play the piano.

46:06.520 --> 46:08.450
Whatever.

46:08.560 --> 46:11.020
Baby.

46:11.130 --> 46:13.690
- I love you.
- I love you.

46:13.790 --> 46:17.200
- I just want what's best
for you, you know that?
- Okay.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.290
Okay, honey.

46:29.740 --> 46:32.300
If you broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together...

46:32.410 --> 46:35.380
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

46:35.480 --> 46:37.810
Sam, get back.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.790
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

46:40.890 --> 46:43.360
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

46:45.660 --> 46:49.430
- Remember the day you wanted the pencil?
- Yeah.

46:49.530 --> 46:52.020
I know why.

46:52.130 --> 46:55.590
- Yeah?
- You wanted the license number
off of that car.

46:55.700 --> 46:58.400
I wrote it down in my notebook.

46:58.510 --> 47:01.270
I got it all but the last number.

47:01.380 --> 47:04.440
I'll get it from you lat...
Can you belch?

47:04.550 --> 47:07.610
Burp. Can you burp?

47:11.020 --> 47:13.350
That's good. That's very good.

47:13.450 --> 47:16.510
- I just had a Coke.
- All right. Listen.

47:16.620 --> 47:18.920
Now, this teacher,
this famous teacher...

47:19.030 --> 47:22.150
He teaches a lot of rich kids
and plays for the symphonies, right?

47:22.260 --> 47:24.890
- Right.
- You belch every few minutes
while you're practicing.

47:25.000 --> 47:27.260
- Okay.
- You apologize to him, but you keep belching.

47:27.370 --> 47:29.960
- You'll offend every sensibility he has.
- Okay.

47:30.070 --> 47:33.800
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

47:33.910 --> 47:37.040
Right, Sam?

47:41.480 --> 47:44.180
- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos?

47:47.790 --> 47:50.350
For you, Creasy.

47:53.660 --> 47:56.460
Thank you.

47:58.830 --> 48:00.700
- How does this look?
- Good.

48:00.800 --> 48:04.570
- Good.
- Hmm?

48:04.670 --> 48:07.230
- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.

48:07.340 --> 48:09.870
- Bye.
- Bye.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.910
Gracias.

48:39.940 --> 48:42.340
Pita.

48:50.650 --> 48:52.780
Pita!

50:16.540 --> 50:18.600
Pita!

50:20.370 --> 50:23.100
Pita!

50:31.320 --> 50:33.310
Pita!

50:42.330 --> 50:44.820
Run!

52:02.710 --> 52:05.110
Creasy!

52:05.210 --> 52:07.200
Creasy!

52:10.020 --> 52:12.420
Creasy. Creasy.

52:12.520 --> 52:14.580
Creasy!

52:27.030 --> 52:28.500
I can't...

52:30.770 --> 52:33.240
Come on!

52:51.660 --> 52:55.320
John W. Creasy is under arrest
for the murder of two police officers...

52:55.430 --> 52:57.260
of the Judicial Police.

52:57.360 --> 52:59.160
Creasy!

52:59.270 --> 53:00.210
Also involved in the kidnapping of...

53:00.250 --> 53:01.160
Also involved in the kidnapping of...

54:58.180 --> 55:00.580
Excuse me.

55:06.360 --> 55:09.490
Everybody relax, okay?
Relax, Sammy.

55:14.000 --> 55:15.970
I know she's your little girl.

55:16.070 --> 55:20.170
When I tell you everything's gonna be
all right, everything's gonna be all right.

55:21.940 --> 55:24.240
<i>Se駉r Ramos.</i>

55:32.290 --> 55:35.250
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

55:35.360 --> 55:39.450
Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.

55:39.560 --> 55:42.860
Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

55:42.960 --> 55:47.920
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

55:48.030 --> 55:52.840
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and
we neither need nor want police assistance.

55:52.940 --> 55:56.600
We're gonna...
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

55:56.710 --> 56:00.650
Se駉r Ramos,
two police officers were killed...

56:00.750 --> 56:02.610
during your daughter's abduction.

56:04.020 --> 56:08.820
I have a written order
from Ministerio Publico...

56:08.920 --> 56:12.880
authorizing our participation
ex-officio.

56:15.930 --> 56:19.800
If you want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

56:21.970 --> 56:23.940
No. Okay.

56:24.040 --> 56:28.130
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

56:28.240 --> 56:30.840
Por favor,don't do that...

56:30.940 --> 56:34.070
or you will find yourself
in a real Mexican hell.

56:34.180 --> 56:37.810
No mariachi.
No tequila... and no Pita.

57:18.120 --> 57:21.060
<i>Crease.</i>

57:21.160 --> 57:23.860
Crease.

57:23.960 --> 57:28.130
When I heard it was
this hospital, I was so pleased.

57:28.230 --> 57:31.470
There is a pastry shop nearby.

57:31.570 --> 57:34.900
Delgado's. They have
the best pastries in Mexico.

57:35.010 --> 57:38.540
Oh, Miguel Manzano...

57:38.650 --> 57:41.270
director of the A.F. I...

57:41.380 --> 57:46.080
and a former director of Interpol...

57:46.190 --> 57:47.980
in Rome.

57:48.090 --> 57:51.490
- And you are?
- Friend of his. Rayburn.

57:51.590 --> 57:53.080
Rayburn?

57:53.110 --> 57:54.560
Rayburn?

58:06.410 --> 58:08.000
Hola.

58:08.110 --> 58:11.640
Do you love your daughter,
Se駉r Ramos?

58:11.750 --> 58:13.840
Yes. Yes.

58:13.950 --> 58:17.140
- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.

58:17.250 --> 58:20.980
Se駉r, if your daughter's life...

58:21.090 --> 58:24.450
is as important to you
as it is to me...

58:24.560 --> 58:26.920
you will do as I say.

58:27.030 --> 58:30.620
- Yes?
- Okay. Yes.

58:30.730 --> 58:33.430
- Crease. Can you hear me?
- Hmm.

58:36.970 --> 58:39.170
You got four of them. All dead.

58:41.410 --> 58:44.040
- Pita.
- It's, uh...

58:46.210 --> 58:50.670
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.

58:52.890 --> 58:56.550
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

59:00.460 --> 59:02.790
Crease.

59:05.000 --> 59:07.970
Don't fuck with me, all right?

59:13.810 --> 59:17.170
Do you have the 10 million?
Do you have the money?

59:17.280 --> 59:21.740
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now if you do as I say...

59:21.850 --> 59:26.050
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

59:26.150 --> 59:29.490
But if you deviate from
the process in any way...

59:32.160 --> 59:34.960
I swear,
you will never see her again.

59:35.060 --> 59:38.030
I understand. Listen, I-I too worship
la Virgin de Guadalupe.

59:38.130 --> 59:39.930
I ask you if you understand.

59:42.800 --> 59:46.070
Hello, sir.
This is, uh, Mr. Ramos's attorney.

59:46.170 --> 59:49.400
He's going through a very difficult
time here, but he understands.

59:49.510 --> 59:52.970
Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.

59:53.080 --> 59:56.520
Okay, the money, 10 million,
U.S., will be divided into...

59:56.620 --> 59:59.810
two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million...

59:59.920 --> 1:00:02.390
which will be checked
at the bank by the K.R. Agent...

1:00:02.490 --> 1:00:06.930
then driven to the house in
an armored car where it will be
transferred to the delivery car.

1:00:07.030 --> 1:00:10.550
You got a flat tire here.

1:00:10.660 --> 1:00:13.960
This is for you.

1:00:14.070 --> 1:00:16.230
Hello. Yeah.

1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:18.900
Listen, I need a driver
to drive Samuel.

1:00:19.010 --> 1:00:21.240
No. Why?

1:00:21.340 --> 1:00:25.140
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

1:00:25.250 --> 1:00:28.410
Look, he's a nervous kid
who doesn't respond well to stress.

1:00:31.150 --> 1:00:35.210
All right.
But the car will not be powerful.

1:00:35.320 --> 1:00:40.450
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

1:00:40.560 --> 1:00:45.000
You will arrive at
La Diana Fountain at 1:00 a.m.

1:00:45.100 --> 1:00:49.970
You will drive around
the circle two times.

1:00:50.070 --> 1:00:54.270
Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window...

1:00:54.370 --> 1:00:56.270
to I.D. The car.

1:00:58.910 --> 1:01:01.470
There is a pay phone
on the southeast corner.

1:01:01.580 --> 1:01:07.020
The phone will ring.
He will answer and wait for instructions.

1:01:08.660 --> 1:01:11.950
There is a map on the top of the phone.
Follow it.

1:01:15.090 --> 1:01:16.960
Perfecto.

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:24.260
- What are you doing? He said no phones!
- Relax. Relax.

1:01:24.370 --> 1:01:27.860
- I'm just trying to protect your daughter.
- Just get me there, please.

1:01:32.250 --> 1:01:37.210
- What's going on?
- Hospitals can be very dangerous places.

1:01:37.320 --> 1:01:41.190
Especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

1:01:53.570 --> 1:01:57.700
Leave the money
in the trunk of the white car.

1:01:57.800 --> 1:02:00.100
Then return to your car.

1:02:01.570 --> 1:02:03.630
Do not look back.

1:02:22.930 --> 1:02:26.990
Remember, I'm a professional.

1:02:27.100 --> 1:02:31.230
If you keep your word,
I will keep mine.

1:02:44.350 --> 1:02:46.380
- Hello.
- Mr. Ramos.

1:02:46.490 --> 1:02:50.010
You betrayed me.
You killed my nephew.

1:02:50.120 --> 1:02:52.250
You took my money.

1:02:52.360 --> 1:02:56.800
Se駉r Ramos...

1:02:58.730 --> 1:03:04.190
All right. Get out of here, all of you.
Get the fuck out of my house!

1:03:04.300 --> 1:03:06.570
Okay, this is Lisa.

1:03:09.340 --> 1:03:12.140
I'm Pita's mother.

1:03:12.250 --> 1:03:16.510
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

1:03:20.250 --> 1:03:24.420
This conversation
is not being recorded.

1:03:26.990 --> 1:03:31.950
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, senora.

1:03:32.070 --> 1:03:35.330
I'm really sorry.

1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:39.460
Now it is too late.

1:03:48.010 --> 1:03:52.470
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house now!

1:03:53.890 --> 1:03:56.250
Get out! Get out!

1:04:37.660 --> 1:04:39.630
Hey.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.490
<i>Hey.</i>

1:04:44.600 --> 1:04:47.510
Hey, Ray.

1:04:49.910 --> 1:04:53.710
- Where am I?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:00.980
Manzano was afraid the cops
were gonna kill you.

1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:05.490
How ya doin', Doc?

1:05:08.900 --> 1:05:10.730
What's the matter?

1:05:15.100 --> 1:05:17.260
She's de... dead, Crease.

1:05:19.970 --> 1:05:21.870
It's a mess.

1:05:21.970 --> 1:05:24.340
Somebody hijacked the drop,
and, uh...

1:05:27.980 --> 1:05:30.110
the kidnapper's nephew was killed...

1:05:30.220 --> 1:05:32.680
so he k... he killed Pita.

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:06.140
No.

1:06:13.430 --> 1:06:15.390
No.

1:06:21.100 --> 1:06:24.130
Did you recognize any of these men?

1:06:25.640 --> 1:06:29.900
No. Does that make me a suspect?

1:06:30.010 --> 1:06:32.640
No.

1:06:32.750 --> 1:06:34.770
It would be convenient, but no.

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:38.840
Um, maybe you should show me
some pictures of some Mexican cops.

1:06:38.950 --> 1:06:40.930
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

1:06:40.970 --> 1:06:42.910
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

1:06:43.020 --> 1:06:45.150
Bad judicial cops.

1:06:46.330 --> 1:06:50.260
Protected by a brotherhood.

1:06:50.360 --> 1:06:52.260
Brotherhood?

1:06:54.130 --> 1:06:59.090
A brotherhood called <i>La Hermandad.</i>

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:14.790
You all set?

1:07:14.890 --> 1:07:17.950
- Hmm?
- Right arm. Here.

1:07:20.930 --> 1:07:23.550
- Okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:25.720
Let's go.

1:08:02.470 --> 1:08:07.200
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah. Lois Lane.

1:08:07.310 --> 1:08:11.210
- Who?
- Mariana something, works for Reforma.

1:08:11.310 --> 1:08:13.510
Newspaper journalist.

1:08:13.610 --> 1:08:16.950
Maybe she thinks you're a scoop.

1:08:18.980 --> 1:08:21.210
I'll get you up to the border.

1:08:21.320 --> 1:08:24.780
A friend of mine will take you to San Diego,
drop you right at the naval hospital.

1:08:24.890 --> 1:08:30.390
- I'm not going, Ray.
- What are you gonna do?

1:08:30.500 --> 1:08:33.590
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:45.040
Buenos d韆s.

1:09:44.870 --> 1:09:47.170
Mr. Creasy?

1:09:47.270 --> 1:09:49.970
A lot of people are looking for you.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.670
I'm Mariana Garcia Guerrero.

1:09:54.980 --> 1:09:56.950
Reporter for Reforma.

1:10:00.090 --> 1:10:04.020
- Nice to meet you.
- I found this across the street.

1:10:06.230 --> 1:10:09.320
Open it.

1:10:13.070 --> 1:10:15.690
It's Santa Muerte.
Death worship.

1:10:19.740 --> 1:10:23.200
- They've put a curse on you.
- Ha. They're a little late.

1:10:26.850 --> 1:10:31.550
- What are you going to do?
- I'm gonna get in my truck and leave.

1:10:34.750 --> 1:10:37.090
I can help you.

1:10:39.230 --> 1:10:43.220
There's a brotherhood
called La Hermandad.

1:10:43.330 --> 1:10:46.300
It protects high-ranking
government officials, corrupt police...

1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:49.770
and organized crime at a level
that is too difficult for me to reach.

1:10:51.500 --> 1:10:53.400
Okay.

1:10:53.510 --> 1:10:58.340
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos
are victims of this organization.

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:03.010
I want to expose them. Talk to me,
give me your story, then I can help you.

1:11:03.120 --> 1:11:05.780
- Please.

1:11:09.820 --> 1:11:11.760
Help me do what?

1:11:13.730 --> 1:11:16.720
You're gonna help me do what?

1:11:16.830 --> 1:11:19.060
You're a stranger here, no?

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:21.220
That's right.

1:11:21.330 --> 1:11:23.630
You're going to need friends
that know their way around.

1:11:25.940 --> 1:11:28.410
Okay.

1:11:28.510 --> 1:11:30.370
Okay, friend that's gonna help me.

1:11:32.810 --> 1:11:37.040
A pleasure to meet you. Tell your driver
to keep his distance next time.

1:11:37.150 --> 1:11:39.410
All right, friend?

1:11:42.020 --> 1:11:44.650
S?

1:12:01.070 --> 1:12:02.970
You'll be stateside by supper time.

1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:05.870
I'm gonna need some help
first though, Ray.

1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:08.910
If you don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day the shape you're in.

1:12:09.010 --> 1:12:12.450
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah.

1:12:12.550 --> 1:12:15.320
But I'm done killing.
I told you that.

1:12:15.420 --> 1:12:17.320
- Okay.
- Anything else is yours.

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:27.320
- You're talking about war.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

1:12:27.430 --> 1:12:30.130
Can you help me?

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:33.030
- Yeah.
- Good.

1:13:47.580 --> 1:13:49.810
- Creasy.

1:14:08.130 --> 1:14:10.030
Hmm.

1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.930
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:57.010
Came to get my stuff.

1:14:57.120 --> 1:14:59.580
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

1:14:59.690 --> 1:15:04.150
- I borrowed it.
- Okay.

1:15:06.130 --> 1:15:08.290
It's crazy, huh?

1:15:08.390 --> 1:15:11.090
One week we're figuring out
which nightclub to go to...

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.190
and the next thing
I'm reading the Bible.

1:15:14.300 --> 1:15:18.030
It's a good thing.
You hold on to it.

1:15:22.410 --> 1:15:27.440
I keep thinking,
if only we hadn't...

1:15:30.420 --> 1:15:33.040
It's like, um...

1:15:34.550 --> 1:15:36.950
my whole life,
all I've ever thought about...

1:15:37.060 --> 1:15:41.050
was what I could get for myself.

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.620
Even with my own baby.

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:50.460
She needed me so much,
and sometimes...

1:15:50.570 --> 1:15:54.370
I felt like I had nothing to give her.

1:15:54.470 --> 1:15:57.100
Just, um, I don't know what to do.

1:15:59.810 --> 1:16:03.250
- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.

1:16:03.350 --> 1:16:05.320
I'm gonna kill 'em.

1:16:06.750 --> 1:16:09.220
Anyone who was involved.
Anybody who profited from it.

1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:11.920
Anybody who opens their eyes at me.

1:16:13.530 --> 1:16:16.220
You kill 'em all.

1:16:43.720 --> 1:16:45.550
Yla Browning.

1:17:26.430 --> 1:17:30.290
Hola.

1:17:30.400 --> 1:17:32.460
Yeah, it's me.

1:17:32.570 --> 1:17:35.630
- Mr. Creasy.
- Okay. I need the license...

1:17:35.730 --> 1:17:37.460
Well, no, excuse me.

1:17:37.570 --> 1:17:41.100
I need the name and address of someone
whose license number is...

1:17:41.210 --> 1:17:42.760
C-5-T-K-8.

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:46.110
That's C-5-T-K-8.

1:17:46.210 --> 1:17:49.440
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need 10 possible matches.

1:17:49.550 --> 1:17:52.680
And when do I find out
which of the 10 it is?

1:17:52.790 --> 1:17:55.520
- Eventually.
- Well, where do I reach you?

1:17:55.620 --> 1:17:59.280
I'll call you.

1:18:17.110 --> 1:18:20.080
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all of that.

1:18:20.180 --> 1:18:25.480
He's an assassin. And you want to help him
identify the owner of a car for him?

1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:38.360
- Mariana.
- S?

1:18:47.410 --> 1:18:49.740
Gracias.

1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:53.240
Ciao.

1:19:26.810 --> 1:19:29.610
Now, Jorge Gonzales.

1:19:36.820 --> 1:19:38.850
Okay.

1:20:04.220 --> 1:20:06.680
What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?

1:20:06.790 --> 1:20:08.750
What I do best.

1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:12.990
Anyone who was involved.
Anybody who profited from it.

1:20:13.090 --> 1:20:15.650
Anybody who opens their eyes at me,
I'm gonna kill 'em.

1:20:27.110 --> 1:20:29.170
Oh, God!

1:20:57.940 --> 1:21:00.430
"Oye Como Va."

1:21:23.100 --> 1:21:25.060
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:34.100
Okay? Ahora.

1:21:37.980 --> 1:21:40.170
Huh? You know who I am?

1:21:47.650 --> 1:21:49.680
Correct.

1:21:49.790 --> 1:21:51.480
Okay.

1:21:51.590 --> 1:21:53.820
Hey, hey, hey.

1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:38.100
No s?nada.

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:20.170
Hmm?

1:23:27.950 --> 1:23:30.820
La Voice.

1:23:50.210 --> 1:23:52.700
Okay.

1:23:52.810 --> 1:23:56.110
Okay.

1:25:12.790 --> 1:25:15.450
Okay. Well.

1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:17.620
Wait, wait, wait.

1:25:17.730 --> 1:25:21.030
Give me one cigarette, please.

1:25:21.130 --> 1:25:23.600
- S?
- Okay.

1:25:28.740 --> 1:25:31.040
緽ueno?

1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:37.610
Okay, my friend.
It's off to the next life for you.

1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:42.550
I guarantee you,
you won't be lonely.

1:26:06.810 --> 1:26:10.340
Revenge is a meal best served cold.

1:27:49.650 --> 1:27:51.740
- La ni馻.
- No.

1:27:51.850 --> 1:27:54.080
縉o? Vamos.

1:28:57.250 --> 1:28:59.240
No?

1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:03.950
Hmm?

1:29:15.030 --> 1:29:18.330
I heard you speaking Spanish.
You're American, right?

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:20.300
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

1:29:20.410 --> 1:29:22.870
- Get out of here. Where are you from?
- I'm from New Jersey.

1:29:22.970 --> 1:29:24.340
- You from New Jersey?
- Yeah.

1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:26.670
I'm from New Jersey.
All right, listen to me.

1:29:30.020 --> 1:29:32.640
All right. Everything
is done up by cell phone.

1:29:32.750 --> 1:29:36.020
You just wait around for calls,
and we don't even have a fucking number.

1:29:36.120 --> 1:29:38.150
Who pays you?

1:29:38.260 --> 1:29:43.320
We got an A.T.M. Card. We take out 200
fucking measly dollars every two weeks.

1:29:45.060 --> 1:29:47.000
- Two hundred dollars?
- Yeah.

1:29:47.100 --> 1:29:49.400
- What's the PI N number?
- The what?

1:29:49.500 --> 1:29:51.330
The PI N number.
Code number.

1:29:55.110 --> 1:29:57.370
- Yeah.
- Good. You wouldn't lie to me, right?

1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.880
- I'm not lying, man.
- Did you kill her? You didn't kill her, did you?

1:29:59.980 --> 1:30:02.000
No.

1:30:04.150 --> 1:30:07.080
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me!
Did you kill her?

1:30:07.190 --> 1:30:08.910
Oh, man, you're making me
fucking nervous.

1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:11.920
- Did you kill her?
- No way. The fucking boss did, or his brother.

1:30:14.660 --> 1:30:17.360
- We never see his face.
- You're not lying to me, are you?

1:30:17.460 --> 1:30:19.690
No. Goddamn it! I'm telling you the truth!

1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:22.320
Tell me, who?
You never see whose face?

1:30:22.430 --> 1:30:24.770
Well, we were in the other room...

1:30:24.870 --> 1:30:28.100
and he was yellin' at the girl
'cause his nephew got killed...

1:30:28.210 --> 1:30:30.610
and the money got stolen.

1:30:30.710 --> 1:30:32.610
Wait, wait. Wh-What?
Somebody stole what money?

1:30:32.710 --> 1:30:35.510
- The ransom money at the drop.
- Who? Who stole it?

1:30:35.610 --> 1:30:38.010
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.
- Who?

1:30:38.120 --> 1:30:40.280
- Fuentes.
- Fuentes?

1:30:40.390 --> 1:30:42.440
Yeah, that's right.

1:30:42.550 --> 1:30:45.180
All right? Huh? Jersey boy?

1:30:45.290 --> 1:30:49.190
Yeah. Now.

1:30:50.460 --> 1:30:53.120
- This Fuentes guy?
- Yeah.

1:30:53.230 --> 1:30:55.630
He's a lieutenant for
the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

1:30:55.730 --> 1:30:58.230
Fuentes is. What'd you do?

1:30:58.340 --> 1:31:00.900
- Oh, man.
- Tell me about the girl. What'd you do?

1:31:01.010 --> 1:31:03.570
- Huh? What'd you do?
- I just do what they told me.

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:05.070
- You do what they tell you to do?
- Yeah.

1:31:05.180 --> 1:31:07.640
Did you say good-bye to her?
Answer my question.

1:31:07.750 --> 1:31:09.740
- Did you say good-bye to her?
- No!

1:31:09.850 --> 1:31:12.320
- You didn't? Here's your chance. Say good-bye.
- Oh, shit!

1:31:12.420 --> 1:31:15.150
Say good-bye to her.
Say good-bye to her.

1:31:15.250 --> 1:31:17.380
Fucking let me go!

1:31:20.020 --> 1:31:22.390
Rico?

1:32:03.570 --> 1:32:05.470
Okay. Okay.

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:23.940
- No?
- No.

1:32:41.610 --> 1:32:43.440
S?

1:32:46.140 --> 1:32:48.410
S?

1:34:23.540 --> 1:34:25.670
- S? Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.

1:34:25.780 --> 1:34:28.870
Yeah, it's me. You know anything about
a young girl being kidnapped recently?

1:34:28.980 --> 1:34:32.140
- She's about 12 years old?
- Yes, that's last night.

1:34:32.250 --> 1:34:33.980
- Do you know something?
- What's her name?

1:34:34.090 --> 1:34:36.080
Uh, Camilla. Camilla Valencias.

1:34:36.190 --> 1:34:39.490
amilla?
e llama Camilla?

1:34:39.590 --> 1:34:41.420
- S?
- Okay. I got her.

1:34:41.530 --> 1:34:44.260
Where are you?

1:35:13.990 --> 1:35:16.790
- Creasy, what happened?
- It's okay.

1:35:16.890 --> 1:35:18.860
Sit down. Relax.

1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:21.800
She's okay. She's okay.
You got banking connections?

1:35:21.900 --> 1:35:25.300
Yes, I have connections.

1:35:27.010 --> 1:35:28.620
Okay. The PI N number's 4747.

1:35:28.660 --> 1:35:30.240
Okay. The PI N number's 4747.

1:35:30.340 --> 1:35:33.830
I wanna find out who's
putting money in that account.

1:35:33.950 --> 1:35:37.510
4747.

1:35:37.620 --> 1:35:40.050
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

1:35:40.150 --> 1:35:42.380
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

1:35:42.490 --> 1:35:44.890
He's the one who drove
Samuel Ramos to the drop.

1:35:44.990 --> 1:35:46.580
- Fuentes?
- S?

1:35:46.690 --> 1:35:50.680
- Who is she?
- You can ask her later.
She'll tell you anything.

1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:53.590
- What do you know about him?
About Fuentes?

1:35:53.700 --> 1:35:57.100
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

1:35:57.200 --> 1:35:58.900
- Huh.
- Never charged.

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:01.870
Arresting officer couldn't testify
'cause he was dead.

1:36:03.470 --> 1:36:05.870
- Is he La Hermandad?
- Mm-hmm.

1:36:05.980 --> 1:36:09.500
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a judicial compound.

1:36:11.450 --> 1:36:14.350
He travels by motorcade.

1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:20.090
Creasy, he's better protected
than the president of Mexico.

1:36:20.190 --> 1:36:22.460
He's gonna need it.
You gonna take care of her?

1:36:22.560 --> 1:36:25.090
- Yes. Well, how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

1:36:52.860 --> 1:36:56.790
This is my jurisdiction.

1:36:56.890 --> 1:37:01.300
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

1:37:01.400 --> 1:37:06.460
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than 10 years of your courts and tribunals.

1:37:06.570 --> 1:37:09.900
- Just stay out of his way.
- I plan to.

1:37:17.350 --> 1:37:20.810
I will even help him, if I can.

1:37:20.920 --> 1:37:25.080
But, uh, I would like to
understand him.

1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:28.590
Give me that.

1:37:28.690 --> 1:37:31.320
Pita Ramos...

1:37:32.900 --> 1:37:34.800
that's a number to you.

1:37:34.900 --> 1:37:39.840
You know, one more dead,
but a number.

1:37:39.940 --> 1:37:42.530
What was she to Creasy then?

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:45.470
She showed him
it was all right to live again.

1:37:48.610 --> 1:37:52.670
And the kidnappers
took that away, huh?

1:37:52.780 --> 1:37:56.740
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:01.520
A man can be an artist...

1:38:04.430 --> 1:38:07.060
in anything... food, whatever.

1:38:07.170 --> 1:38:11.730
It depends on how good he is at it.

1:38:15.140 --> 1:38:17.040
Creasy's art is death.

1:38:19.910 --> 1:38:23.710
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

1:38:31.090 --> 1:38:33.560
I don't have anything else to say.

1:40:02.180 --> 1:40:04.810
Shh. Shh.

1:40:23.370 --> 1:40:25.700
Forgiveness is between them and God.

1:40:25.800 --> 1:40:28.700
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

1:42:25.060 --> 1:42:27.790
Don't move.
Put your hands down. Put 'em down.

1:42:36.500 --> 1:42:39.130
Se駉r John W. Creasy...

1:42:39.240 --> 1:42:42.730
is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police.

1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:47.940
He's suspected
of possible involvement...

1:42:48.050 --> 1:42:51.500
of possible involvement in
the kidnapping of Lupita Ramos.

1:43:21.510 --> 1:43:24.310
Can you hear me? Huh?

1:43:25.950 --> 1:43:27.920
Know where we are?

1:43:29.150 --> 1:43:33.520
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad.

1:43:33.620 --> 1:43:38.390
The ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?

1:43:38.500 --> 1:43:41.160
- Have you heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.

1:43:41.270 --> 1:43:43.170
- Do you know what it is?
- Yes.

1:43:43.270 --> 1:43:45.390
I'm the president of La Hermandad.

1:43:45.500 --> 1:43:47.200
- You're the president?
- Yes.

1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:49.400
The president? Wow.

1:43:49.510 --> 1:43:51.570
Look at me.

1:43:52.840 --> 1:43:55.240
Oh, you can't.
I'm sorry.

1:43:55.350 --> 1:43:57.410
How's that?

1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:07.920
Let me show you what I got here.

1:44:09.860 --> 1:44:13.390
See this? This is a charger. It's used
by convicts to hide money and drugs.

1:44:13.500 --> 1:44:17.190
They stick it in their body.
They tuck it up their rectum.

1:44:17.300 --> 1:44:20.530
You familiar with that?
This... Look at me.

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:23.400
Pencil detonator.

1:44:23.510 --> 1:44:27.240
Timer, used as a receiver-transmitter.

1:44:27.340 --> 1:44:30.370
C-4. Highly explosive.

1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:32.710
You put 'em all together,
you got a bomb.

1:44:32.820 --> 1:44:35.380
Not very sophisticated,
but very powerful.

1:44:37.590 --> 1:44:40.220
That's what you have in your ass right now.

1:44:40.320 --> 1:44:43.690
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

1:44:47.970 --> 1:44:50.430
Cheap watch. Pager watch.

1:44:50.530 --> 1:44:56.170
Used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

1:44:56.270 --> 1:44:59.470
So, I'm gonna send you a page...

1:44:59.580 --> 1:45:01.480
which you will receive...

1:45:04.650 --> 1:45:07.140
in five minutes.

1:45:07.250 --> 1:45:09.480
Now.

1:45:14.330 --> 1:45:16.730
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down...

1:45:16.830 --> 1:45:19.960
between your men and the kidnapper.

1:45:20.060 --> 1:45:21.900
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:24.630
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

1:45:24.740 --> 1:45:28.430
You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.

1:45:30.570 --> 1:45:32.570
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
Are you sure?

1:45:35.410 --> 1:45:38.280
Okay.

1:45:38.380 --> 1:45:41.610
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

1:45:41.720 --> 1:45:44.480
- Hey, relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

1:45:44.590 --> 1:45:47.460
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

1:45:47.560 --> 1:45:50.320
I saw the opportunity,
and I got lucky.

1:45:50.430 --> 1:45:51.920
And?

1:45:52.030 --> 1:45:55.120
And I had my men ready as we
got instructions where to go.

1:45:55.230 --> 1:45:57.170
You had your men ready
to steal the drop.

1:45:57.270 --> 1:45:59.700
You had your men ready to kill
one of the kidnappers, yeah?

1:45:59.800 --> 1:46:02.330
You've done this many times.

1:46:04.240 --> 1:46:07.540
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper...
- Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

1:46:07.650 --> 1:46:10.710
- Bingo, yeah. You've done this
many times, huh?
- Many times, yeah.

1:46:10.810 --> 1:46:14.150
- Yeah. Killed many victims too, haven't you?
- Come on, sir.

1:46:14.250 --> 1:46:17.220
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

1:46:20.290 --> 1:46:23.390
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

1:46:24.860 --> 1:46:28.130
Wait-Wait a minute. Come on.

1:46:28.230 --> 1:46:30.500
- I have a little gift for you.
<i>- For me?</i>

1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:33.400
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
- What do you got?

1:46:33.500 --> 1:46:37.630
There was no $10 million.
There was one half in the bags.

1:46:37.740 --> 1:46:40.470
The ransom was $10 million?
They put it in two bags.

1:46:40.580 --> 1:46:42.700
- Five million in each bag, right?
- Two bags, true.

1:46:42.810 --> 1:46:46.340
But one has half paper...

1:46:46.450 --> 1:46:49.540
the other only paper.

1:46:49.650 --> 1:46:53.560
Maybe your men stole it.

1:46:53.660 --> 1:46:56.150
Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:01.160
Okay. At the Ramos house...

1:47:01.270 --> 1:47:05.900
before the exchange,
who put the bags in the car?

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:08.270
- Guess what.
- What?

1:47:08.370 --> 1:47:11.670
Ramos lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

1:47:11.780 --> 1:47:14.240
- Jordan Kalfus?
- Yeah.

1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:19.350
Pedro.

1:47:26.620 --> 1:47:29.110
Sir? Please.

1:47:29.230 --> 1:47:31.920
I-I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry for the girl.

1:47:32.030 --> 1:47:36.020
It was just business.
You know, I'm a professional.

1:47:36.130 --> 1:47:39.430
That's what everybody keeps saying.
"I'm just a professional."

1:47:39.540 --> 1:47:42.330
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
"I'm just a professional. I'm just a professional."

1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:45.470
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that.
You understand me?

1:47:48.880 --> 1:47:51.810
What are you going to do now?

1:47:51.920 --> 1:47:54.040
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna leave. I gotta go.

1:47:54.150 --> 1:47:57.310
- Yeah. I got...
- Come on. Come on. What about me, huh?

1:47:57.420 --> 1:48:00.390
- What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on.

1:48:00.490 --> 1:48:04.930
- Thirty-five.
- A last wish, please. Please.

1:48:05.030 --> 1:48:10.260
Last wish?
I wish you had more time.

1:48:10.370 --> 1:48:14.460
Hey! Hey, hey!

1:50:16.960 --> 1:50:20.590
Hola.

1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:23.330
<i>- Mariana, it's me.</i>
- Creasy, where are you?

1:50:23.430 --> 1:50:26.100
Listen, I got something
that looks like banking codes...

1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:28.070
from Bank Coast in the Cayman Islands.

1:50:28.170 --> 1:50:31.300
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

1:50:31.410 --> 1:50:35.500
Jordan Kalfus, and it looks like
U.S. Deposits and withdrawals.

1:50:35.610 --> 1:50:37.550
Give me the same thing
on Samuel Ramos.

1:50:37.650 --> 1:50:41.380
Samuel Ramos. That's it?

1:50:41.490 --> 1:50:43.210
- That's it.
- Okay.

1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:20.360
<i>Gracias.</i>

1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:32.430
- Creasy.
- Samuel.

1:51:32.540 --> 1:51:34.530
Honey?

1:51:38.140 --> 1:51:40.510
What's going on?

1:51:42.310 --> 1:51:46.340
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on?

1:51:48.790 --> 1:51:51.690
Huh, Sam?

1:51:51.790 --> 1:51:54.020
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple
of questions, okay?

1:51:54.120 --> 1:51:57.060
You move...

1:51:57.160 --> 1:51:59.190
you make one sound...

1:51:59.300 --> 1:52:02.390
I'll snatch the life right outta you,
you understand?

1:52:09.710 --> 1:52:12.400
What happened, Lisa, hmm?

1:52:12.510 --> 1:52:14.410
Were you in on this?

1:52:14.510 --> 1:52:18.680
- Or was it just your husband, huh?
- Am I in on what?

1:52:18.780 --> 1:52:22.310
You know what I'm talking about... Pita's
kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?

1:52:22.420 --> 1:52:25.720
- Pita got killed because the ransom got stolen.
- Shut up!

1:52:27.260 --> 1:52:29.620
Yeah, the money was stolen.
You're right. He's right.

1:52:29.730 --> 1:52:33.250
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen though, huh?

1:52:33.360 --> 1:52:36.360
- $2.5 million, right?
- What are you talking about?

1:52:36.470 --> 1:52:39.590
He knows what I'm talking about.
$2.5 million. That's what Victor got, isn't it?

1:52:39.700 --> 1:52:42.700
- What are you talking about?
- 2.5 million.

1:52:42.810 --> 1:52:45.100
2.5 million to your lawyer
Jordan Kalfus...

1:52:45.210 --> 1:52:48.340
that he put in an account in the Cayman
Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:54.010
What happened to the other five, Sam?

1:52:54.120 --> 1:52:57.050
Huh? That's 2.5, 2.5.
What is five from 10?

1:52:57.150 --> 1:52:59.680
That's five. What happened
to the other five, Sam? Tell your wife.

1:52:59.790 --> 1:53:02.220
- It's your chance to talk.
What happened to the other five?

1:53:02.330 --> 1:53:03.690
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't have a wife.

1:53:03.790 --> 1:53:06.560
Then you'll never know how hard
it could be to tell your wife the truth.

1:53:06.660 --> 1:53:08.890
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

1:53:09.000 --> 1:53:11.130
It was in this room
that my father prayed.

1:53:11.230 --> 1:53:13.930
- I don't give a fuck about your fucking father!
- My father prayed.

1:53:14.040 --> 1:53:17.940
He prayed that his gambling
debts and his infidelities would
be forgiven right in this room.

1:53:18.040 --> 1:53:20.740
- Samuel! I love you!
- What, Lisa?

1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:24.640
- Tell me the truth.
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

1:53:24.750 --> 1:53:27.650
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess.

1:53:27.750 --> 1:53:30.650
- I inherited his lawyer Jordan...
- You tell me what happened to my baby!

1:53:30.750 --> 1:53:33.310
Say it! Say it! Say it!

1:53:33.420 --> 1:53:36.050
Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!

1:53:39.860 --> 1:53:42.300
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room...

1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:44.800
and watch cartoons all day...

1:53:44.900 --> 1:53:47.770
and she'd eat ice cream
and we'd have her back in two days.

1:53:47.870 --> 1:53:50.470
He lied to me!

1:53:50.570 --> 1:53:53.440
That's why he's fucking dead!
I did it!

1:53:53.540 --> 1:53:55.600
I did it, Lisa!

1:53:55.710 --> 1:53:58.440
I agreed to the kidnapping.

1:53:58.550 --> 1:54:01.980
I did it for us...
for the three of us.

1:54:10.430 --> 1:54:12.550
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

1:54:18.570 --> 1:54:20.540
You kill him.

1:54:21.940 --> 1:54:23.840
You kill him or I will.

1:54:54.200 --> 1:54:56.170
Huh. You know, they say a, um...

1:54:58.580 --> 1:55:01.700
a bullet always tells the truth.

1:55:10.990 --> 1:55:12.960
It never lies.

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:30.200
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe...

1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:35.040
Maybe it'll work for you.

1:55:44.350 --> 1:55:46.950
I'll pray for you.

1:58:49.410 --> 1:58:51.310
Gracias.

1:59:16.100 --> 1:59:18.000
- 縃ola?
- Hola.

1:59:18.100 --> 1:59:20.590
- Mr. Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.

1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:24.760
- I traced the PIN for you
and I have an address.
- Yeah?

1:59:24.870 --> 1:59:28.330
The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of 揟he Voice."

1:59:28.450 --> 1:59:32.710
She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, Via Appia.

1:59:32.820 --> 1:59:35.280
- Good.
- And another thing.

1:59:35.390 --> 1:59:39.190
Pick up today's paper and you'll have
a picture of 揟he Voice."

1:59:39.290 --> 1:59:41.260
Good. Thank you.

2:00:44.250 --> 2:00:46.350
Shh, shh, shh.

2:01:49.820 --> 2:01:51.750
Jos? 縌u?te pasa?

2:03:06.830 --> 2:03:08.660

2:03:08.770 --> 2:03:10.730
Okay.

2:03:18.310 --> 2:03:20.070
Hmm?

2:03:26.580 --> 2:03:28.050
Hmm?

2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:41.060
S?

2:03:41.160 --> 2:03:43.160
Okay. Uh...

2:03:47.500 --> 2:03:49.400
- 縎?
S?

2:03:56.610 --> 2:03:59.240
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez. Okay.

2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:06.020
Okay.

2:04:14.460 --> 2:04:16.400
S?

2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:18.900
S?

2:04:19.000 --> 2:04:20.940
Huh?

2:05:17.790 --> 2:05:19.760
Momento.

2:05:49.430 --> 2:05:51.360
Hola, Daniel.

2:05:51.460 --> 2:05:53.330
Se駉r Creasy.

2:05:53.430 --> 2:05:56.800
Yeah. Yeah, I got your family here.

2:05:56.900 --> 2:05:59.460
Your brother doesn't look too good.

2:05:59.570 --> 2:06:02.830
Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months?

2:06:02.940 --> 2:06:07.000
Huh? You wanna negotiate?

2:06:10.910 --> 2:06:14.580
The most important thing
in life is family.

2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:16.880
Do you agree?

2:06:18.090 --> 2:06:19.990
I agree.

2:06:21.790 --> 2:06:24.260
And there you are.
You have my family.

2:06:24.360 --> 2:06:27.230
Well, most of my family.

2:06:27.330 --> 2:06:31.490
My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:35.370
Now, tell me seriously,
h-how much do you want?

2:06:35.470 --> 2:06:37.230
Ah.

2:06:39.780 --> 2:06:42.270
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Yeah, hold on.

2:06:53.360 --> 2:06:56.520
I'm gonna take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

2:06:56.630 --> 2:06:58.690
Piece by piece. Shut up!

2:06:59.900 --> 2:07:02.690
I don't want your money!

2:07:02.800 --> 2:07:06.430
Do you understand me?
You understand me? I want you.

2:07:39.570 --> 2:07:41.660
I'm listening.

2:07:43.110 --> 2:07:46.470
I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.

2:07:52.680 --> 2:07:55.980
All right,
I will give you a life for a life.

2:07:57.590 --> 2:08:00.150
Whose life?
What are you talking about?

2:08:00.260 --> 2:08:03.020
Whose life, Daniel? I want you.

2:08:03.130 --> 2:08:06.620
I will give you her life for your life.

2:08:06.730 --> 2:08:11.190
And in exchange,
I will get my life back.

2:08:11.300 --> 2:08:15.290
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

2:08:19.210 --> 2:08:23.370
- Pita's dead.
- Creasy!

2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.820
I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.

2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:35.090
All right.

2:08:37.030 --> 2:08:39.220
I want proof of life. You hear me?

2:08:39.330 --> 2:08:42.300
I want proof of life.
I want... I want...

2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:44.830
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

2:08:44.930 --> 2:08:47.560
You tell her to tell you...

2:08:47.670 --> 2:08:51.200
to tell me what she calls her bear.

2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.600
- Yeah?
- Creasy.

2:09:22.710 --> 2:09:25.700
She calls the bear Creasy Bear.

2:09:41.620 --> 2:09:43.590
Okay.

2:09:45.430 --> 2:09:48.020
O-Okay.

2:09:48.130 --> 2:09:50.690
I give you your brother,
you give me the girl.

2:09:52.440 --> 2:09:54.770
- All right.
- Where?

2:10:38.450 --> 2:10:40.350
Hello?

2:10:40.450 --> 2:10:43.110
Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

2:10:43.220 --> 2:10:45.410
I think Pita's alive.

2:10:47.220 --> 2:10:49.450
I can't take this anymore.

2:10:49.560 --> 2:10:51.490
Take the road to Puebla.

2:10:51.590 --> 2:10:54.460
Get off junction 34, south side.

2:10:54.560 --> 2:10:56.590
I'll meet you there in two hours.

2:11:41.910 --> 2:11:43.810
So where is she?

2:11:46.350 --> 2:11:49.480
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

2:11:54.790 --> 2:11:58.060
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

2:11:58.160 --> 2:12:01.490
this is his brother.

2:12:02.870 --> 2:12:04.990
Here.

2:12:05.100 --> 2:12:08.830
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

2:12:08.940 --> 2:12:11.700
If anything goes wrong,
you put it to his head.

2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:15.400
You pull the trigger, all right?

2:12:16.450 --> 2:12:18.970
You understand?

2:12:22.050 --> 2:12:24.420
You don't...

2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:27.790
Let him loose until she's with you.

2:12:27.890 --> 2:12:29.860
You got it?

2:12:32.330 --> 2:12:34.990
And you don't wait for me, okay?

2:12:37.730 --> 2:12:39.460
Yeah.

2:12:39.570 --> 2:12:43.130
- You'll be all right. You okay?
- Yeah.

2:14:28.310 --> 2:14:30.210
Creasy!

2:14:31.980 --> 2:14:33.950
Creasy!

2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:37.590
Creasy!

2:14:53.870 --> 2:14:56.270
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2:14:56.370 --> 2:14:59.070
They didn't hurt you?

2:14:59.170 --> 2:15:01.510
Hi.

2:15:04.250 --> 2:15:08.550
Your mother's waitin' for you. She's right
down there at the end of the bridge.

2:15:08.650 --> 2:15:12.280
- Okay? You go home.
- Okay.

2:15:12.390 --> 2:15:15.120
- All right.
- Where are you goin'?

2:15:18.990 --> 2:15:21.460
I'm goin' home too.

2:15:22.500 --> 2:15:24.400
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

2:15:28.670 --> 2:15:31.300
Oh, Hey.

2:15:31.410 --> 2:15:34.740
I got something for you.

2:15:36.810 --> 2:15:38.800
I got the last number too.

2:15:38.910 --> 2:15:41.750
I love you, Creasy.

2:15:44.250 --> 2:15:46.920
And you love me, don't you?

2:15:48.020 --> 2:15:50.120
Yes, I do.

2:15:50.230 --> 2:15:53.420
With all my heart. Pita, go.

2:15:53.530 --> 2:15:55.500
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

2:16:11.050 --> 2:16:14.310
- Pita! Baby, come here. It's okay.
- Mom!

2:16:14.420 --> 2:16:17.610
- Mom!
- Come on! Okay, I'll let you go now.

2:16:17.720 --> 2:16:19.780
Mom!
